    "translated_abstract": "在不断观测的隐私问题中，我们研究如何基于随时间演变的数据集发布差分隐私估计。发布私有前缀求和$x_1,x_2,x_3,\\dots\\in\\{0,1\\}$问题是一个特别好研究的问题，并且在私有随机梯度下降的最新方法中使用了一个广义形式。标志性的二进制机制自动加入的噪声的方差是多对数的。最近，Henzinger et al.和Denisov et al.表示，可以通过两种方式提高二进制机制：噪声的方差可以减小一个较大的常数因子，并且在时间步长内也可以更加平均。但是，他们生成噪声分布的算法在计算时间和（特别是）空间方面都不如人意。我们通过提供一种可微且凸的简单替代二进制机制的方法来解决效率问题，从而使我们能够相对于添加的噪声量对机制进行优化。我们的机制比标志性的二进制机制具有更低的方差和更好的观测时间保证，并且在计算和空间要求方面比以前的改进更有效。",
