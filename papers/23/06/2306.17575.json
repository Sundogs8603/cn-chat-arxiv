    "translated_abstract": "在许多高度选择性的机构中，大学录取采用全面评估过程，考虑申请的所有方面，包括隐私属性（如种族、性别）、成绩、论文和推荐信，以组成一支优秀和多样化的班级。在本研究中，我们使用机器学习（ML）模型实证评估受保护属性对预测录取决策的影响，并探讨文本信息（如个人论文、教师推荐信）在模型中代替受保护属性的程度。通过使用2022-2023学年在一所具有选择性的美国本科入学办公室的14,915名申请人的数据，我们发现从ML模型中排除受保护属性会显著降低预测录取表现。通过TF-IDF表示和隐狄利克雷分配（LDA）模型，文本信息的包含部分恢复了模型的性能。",
