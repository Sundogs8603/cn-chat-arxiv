    "abstract": "This research delves into the intersection of illustration art and artificial intelligence (AI), focusing on how illustrators engage with AI agents that embody their original characters (OCs). We introduce 'ORIBA', a customizable AI chatbot that enables illustrators to converse with their OCs. This approach allows artists to not only receive responses from their OCs but also to observe their inner monologues and behavior. Despite the existing tension between artists and AI, our study explores innovative collaboration methods that are inspiring to illustrators. By examining the impact of AI on the creative process and the boundaries of authorship, we aim to enhance human-AI interactions in creative fields, with potential applications extending beyond illustration to interactive storytelling and more.",
