    "translated_abstract": "正则化是一组用于提高深度神经网络泛化能力的技术。本文介绍了一种新颖的有效方法——谱批量归一化(SBN)，通过在频域中归一化特征映射来提高泛化。在网络深度初始化阶段，无批量归一化(BN)的残差网络的激活往往以指数级增长，导致特征映射范数非常大，尽管参数相对较小。这种爆炸性动态对学习非常有害。BN使得对缩放因子 γ, β 进行权值衰减正则化近似等效于对特征映射范数进行加性惩罚，从一定程度上防止特征映射范数变得过大。然而，我们通过实验证明，尽管 BN 进行了近似的加性惩罚，深度神经网络(DNNs)中的特征映射往往在网络开始阶段仍然会爆炸。",
