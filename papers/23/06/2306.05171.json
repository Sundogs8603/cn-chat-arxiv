    "translated_abstract": "传统的机器人任务规划方法在处理高度非结构化环境和复杂任务时面临困难。我们提出了一种任务规划方法，将人类专业知识与LLM相结合，并设计了更具表现力的LLM提示模板Think_Net_Prompt，以表示结构化的专业知识。我们进一步提出了一种渐进分解任务并生成任务树来减少每个任务的规划量的方法，同时设计了一种策略来解耦机器人任务规划。通过将不同的规划实体划分和将任务与实际机器绑定过程分开，任务规划过程变得更加灵活。研究结果表明，我们的方法在处理指定的代码格式、理解任务和子任务之间的关系以及从文本描述中提取参数方面表现良好。然而，也存在一些问题，如任务逻辑处理的复杂度有限，在数量歧义方面存在一定的问题。",
