Reinforcement Learning (RL), a machine learning paradigm shown to possess a great potential in improving and surpassing human level performance in numerous complex tasks, allows coping with the mentioned demands. In this paper, we present an OPC UA based Operational Technology (OT)-aware RL architecture, which extends the standard RL setting, combining it with the setting of digital twins. Moreover, we define an OPC UA information model allowing for a generalized plug-and-play like approach for exchanging the RL agent used. In conclusion, we demonstrate and evaluate the architecture, by creating a proof of concept. By means of solving a toy example, we show that this architecture can be used to determine the optimal policy using a real control system.",

    "translated_abstract": "工业4.0受到了缩短上市时间、产品批量定制以及批量为一生产等需求的推动。强化学习（RL）是一种机器学习范例，已经在很多复杂任务中显示出具有优于人类的潜力，可以应对上述需求。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于OPC UA的操作技术感知RL架构，它扩展了标准RL设置，并将其与数字孪生的设置相结合。此外，我们还定义了一种OPC UA信息模型，允许采用广义的即插即用方法交换所使用的RL代理。最后，我们通过创建一个概念验证来展示和评估这个架构。通过解决一个玩具例子，我们展示了这个架构可以用于使用实际控制系统确定最优策略。",
