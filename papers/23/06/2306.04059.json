    "abstract": "Amid ongoing health crisis, there is a growing necessity to discern possible signs of Wellness Dimensions (WD) manifested in self-narrated text. As the distribution of WD on social media data is intrinsically imbalanced, we experiment the generative NLP models for data augmentation to enable further improvement in the pre-screening task of classifying WD. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation approach through prompt-based Generative NLP models, and evaluate the ROUGE scores and syntactic/semantic similarity among existing interpretations and augmented data. Our approach with ChatGPT model surpasses all the other methods and achieves improvement over baselines such as Easy-Data Augmentation and Backtranslation. Introducing data augmentation to generate more training samples and balanced dataset, results in the improved F-score and the Matthew's Correlation Coefficient for upto 13.11% and 15.95%, respectively.",

    "translated_abstract": "在当前的健康危机中，有必要识别出在自述文本中表现出的健康维度（WD）的可能迹象。由于社交媒体数据中的WD分布内在地不平衡，我们尝试使用生成NLP模型进行数据增强，以便在分类WD的预筛选任务中进一步提高性能。为此，我们提出了一种简单而有效的数据增强方法，即基于提示的生成NLP模型，并评估了现有解释和增强数据之间的ROUGE得分以及句法/语义相似性。我们使用ChatGPT模型的方法超越了所有其他方法，并在基线（如Easy-Data Augmentation和Backtranslation）上取得了改进。引入数据增强以生成更多的训练样本和平衡的数据集，使F-score和Matthew's Correlation Coefficient得分分别提高了13.11%和15.95%。",
