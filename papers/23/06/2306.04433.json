    "translated_abstract": "心电图(ECG)的分类在自动心血管诊断系统的发展中扮演着至关重要的角色。但是，不同个体之间ECG信号的相当差异是一个重大挑战。数据分布的变化限制了模型的跨领域利用。本研究提出了一种解决方案，通过利用从标记源域获取的知识来对未标记的数据集中的ECG进行分类。我们提出了一种基于跨域特征差异优化的领域自适应深度网络。我们的方法包括三个阶段：预训练、聚类中心计算和自适应。在预训练阶段，我们采用分布鲁棒优化(DRO)技术来处理最坏情况训练损失的消失。为了增强特征的丰富性，我们将三个时间特征与深度学习特征连接起来。聚类计算阶段涉及计算源聚类的明显可分离簇的质心，",
