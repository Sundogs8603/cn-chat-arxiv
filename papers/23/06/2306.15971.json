Using in vivo recordings in awake mice, we employ a novel spatiotemporal bimodal transformer architecture to infer current blood flow based on both historical blood flow and ongoing spontaneous neuronal activity. Our findings indicate that incorporating neuronal activity significantly enhances the model's ability to predict blood flow values.

    "translated_abstract": "血流与神经活动之间的关系被广泛认可，在fMRI研究中，血流经常被用作神经活动的替代指标。在微观水平上，已经显示神经活动会影响附近血管的血流。本研究首次引入了一种预测模型，直接在明确的神经元群体水平上解决了这个问题。使用清醒小鼠的体内记录，我们使用一种新颖的时空双模态变换器架构，根据历史血流和持续自发神经活动来推断当前的血流。我们的发现表明，结合神经活动明显改善了模型预测血流值的能力。通过分析模型的行为，我们提出了关于血液动力学响应神经活动的尚未深入研究的性质的假设。",
