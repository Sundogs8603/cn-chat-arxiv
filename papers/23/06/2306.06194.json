    "translated_abstract": "实时需求预测是动态公交路线规划的关键输入。虽然许多研究人员已经开发了许多复杂的方法来预测短期公共交通需求，但应用范围仅限于短时间、稳定的时间范围和少数车站。这些方法在高度动态的环境中的表现还没有得到研究，也没有系统地进行比较。我们建立了一个开源基础设施，包括计量和深度学习方法，评估它们在稳定和高度动态条件下的表现。我们使用智能卡数据的时间序列预测哥伦比亚波哥大BRT系统在隔日的需求。时间序列的动态条件包括一个长达一个月的抗议和COVID-19大流行。这两个条件都引发了需求的巨大变化。结果表明，在稳定条件下，大多数测试模型的表现相似，MAAPE从0.08到0.12不等。 基准设施的",
