    "abstract": "Investigators, funders, and the public desire knowledge on topics and trends in publicly funded research but current efforts in manual categorization are limited in scale and understanding. We developed a semi-automated approach to extract and name research topics, and applied this to \\$1.9B of NCI funding over 21 years in the radiological sciences to determine micro- and macro-scale research topics and funding trends. Our method relies on sequential clustering of existing biomedical-based word embeddings, naming using subject matter experts, and visualization to discover trends at a macroscopic scale above individual topics. We present results using 15 and 60 cluster topics, where we found that 2D projection of grant embeddings reveals two dominant axes: physics-biology and therapeutic-diagnostic. For our dataset, we found that funding for therapeutics- and physics-based research have outpaced diagnosticsand biology-based research, respectively. We hope these results may (1) give in",

    "translated_abstract": "调查员、资助方和公众都想了解公共资金资助的研究主题和趋势，但目前手动分类的努力在规模和理解方面受到限制。我们开发了一种半自动的方法来提取和命名研究主题，并将其应用于放射科学中210亿美元的NCI资助21年以确定微观和宏观研究主题和资助趋势。我们的方法依赖于现有生物医学词向量的序列聚类、专家进行命名和可视化以发现宏观主题。我们提供了15个和60个聚类主题的结果，发现拨款嵌入的2D投影显示两个主导轴：物理-生物学和治疗-诊断。对于我们的数据集，我们发现对治疗和物理学为基础的研究的资助已经超过了基于诊断和生物学的研究。希望这些结果能够：（1）提供NCI在放射科学中研究经费分配的见解；（2）促进研究者和非专家对这个领域的关注并进一步探索。",
