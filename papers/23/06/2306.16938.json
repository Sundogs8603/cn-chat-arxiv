    "translated_abstract": "对于分类神经网络来说，对于空间变换（如平移和旋转）的不变性是一种理想的属性和基本的设计原则。然而，常用的卷积神经网络（CNNs）实际上对于即使是微小的平移也非常敏感。存在着大量的工作来通过设计具有变换不变性的模型或评估变换来实现精确或近似的变换不变性。这些工作通常对标准CNNs进行更改，并对标准数据集上的性能造成损害。在本文中，与其修改分类器，我们提出了一个预分类恢复器，将已翻译（甚至旋转）的输入恢复到原始输入，并将其传送到相同数据集的任何分类器中。此恢复器基于一个理论结果，该结果给出了一个仿射算子在张量空间上是平移等变的充分且必要条件。",
