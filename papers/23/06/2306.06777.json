    "translated_abstract": "在基于表格数据的分类和预测中，人们经常使用基于树的模型。这可以在表格数据上与深度神经网络竞争[参见Grinsztajn等人，NeurIPS 2022，arXiv：2207.08815]，并且在某些条件下是可解释的。可解释性取决于树的深度和每个叶节点的准确性。在这里，我们训练了一个低深度的树，其目标是最小化每个叶节点上的最大错误分类，并从低深度树的每个叶节点“挂起”进一步的基于树的模型（例如无限深度的树）。低深度树易于解释，而综合低深度和挂起的基于树的模型的整体统计性能优于使用经典方法（例如CART）训练的无限深度决策树，并且与最先进的方法（例如优化的XGBoost）相当。",
