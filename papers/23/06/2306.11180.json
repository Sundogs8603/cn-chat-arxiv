    "translated_abstract": "对于域转移下的语义分割任务，基于图像区域和伪标签的主动学习获取策略是最先进的。在区域内存在不同类别的伪标签可以识别出不同类别之间的像素，这是一种高效的主动学习数据获取策略。然而，由于设计限制，伪标签的变化仅限于选择类别的轮廓，限制了最终的主动学习性能。我们首次在Poincaré双曲球模型中使用超bolic方法来进行语义分割的主动学习，并利用区域内像素嵌入的半径变化作为一种新的数据获取策略。这源于一种无层次约束训练的超bolic空间的新颖几何特性，我们通过实验证明了这一点。也就是说，类别被映射到具有相当内类半径方差的紧凑超bolic区域，因为模型将难以解释的类别放置在更密集的超bolic区域内。",
