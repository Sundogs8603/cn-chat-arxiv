    "abstract": "With a recent influx of voice generation methods, the threat introduced by audio DeepFake (DF) is ever-increasing. Several different detection methods have been presented as a countermeasure. Many methods are based on so-called front-ends, which, by transforming the raw audio, emphasize features crucial for assessing the genuineness of the audio sample. Our contribution contains investigating the influence of the state-of-the-art Whisper automatic speech recognition model as a DF detection front-end. We compare various combinations of Whisper and well-established front-ends by training 3 detection models (LCNN, SpecRNet, and MesoNet) on a widely used ASVspoof 2021 DF dataset and later evaluating them on the DF In-The-Wild dataset. We show that using Whisper-based features improves the detection for each model and outperforms recent results on the In-The-Wild dataset by reducing Equal Error Rate by 21%.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着人声生成方法的不断涌现，音频DeepFake（DF）所带来的威胁正在不断增加。许多检测方法都基于所谓的前端技术，通过转换原始音频，强调评估音频样本真实性所必需的特征。我们的贡献在于将最先进的Whisper自动语音识别模型作为DF检测的前端，并比较不同组合的Whisper和已建立的前端，通过在广泛使用的ASVspoof 2021 DF数据集上训练3个检测模型（LCNN，SpecRNet和MesoNet），并在DF In-The-Wild数据集上进行后续评估。我们表明，使用基于Whisper的特征可以改进每个模型的检测效果，并通过将等误差率降低21％来超越最近在In-The-Wild数据集上获得的结果。",
