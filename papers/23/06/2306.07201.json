    "translated_abstract": "在社交媒体上，虚假信息往往能够迅速传播，从而对公民的行为和社会事件的反应产生负面影响。为更好地检测虚假新闻，尤其是那些较长文本，更难以完整查找的虚假信息，我们提出了一个名为LTCR的长文本中文谣言检测数据集。LTCR数据集为准确检测谣言，特别是与COVID-19相关的复杂虚假新闻提供了重要资源。该数据集包含1,729条真实新闻和500条虚假新闻，其中真实新闻和虚假新闻的平均长度分别约为230和152个字符。我们还提出了名为SFD（Salience-aware Fake News Detection Model）的算法，在LTCR数据集上的测试中，达到了最高的准确度（95.85％），虚假新闻回收率（90.91％）和F1分数（90.60％）。",
