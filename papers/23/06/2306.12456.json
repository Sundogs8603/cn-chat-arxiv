    "abstract": "Design activity -- constructing an artifact description satisfying given goals and constraints -- distinguishes humanity from other animals and traditional machines, and endowing machines with design abilities at the human level or beyond has been a long-term pursuit. Though machines have already demonstrated their abilities in designing new materials, proteins, and computer programs with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the search space for designing such objects is relatively small, and thus, \"Can machines design like humans?\" remains an open question. To explore the boundary of machine design, here we present a new AI approach to automatically design a central processing unit (CPU), the brain of a computer, and one of the world's most intricate devices humanity have ever designed. This approach generates the circuit logic, which is represented by a graph structure called Binary Speculation Diagram (BSD), of the CPU design from only external input-output observations",

    "translated_abstract": "设计活动——构建一个满足给定目标和限制条件的工件描述——区别于人类和传统机器，赋予机器人类水平或更高的设计能力一直是一个长期追求的目标。虽然机器已经展示了运用先进的人工智能技术设计新材料、蛋白质和计算机程序的能力，但这些工件的设计空间相对较小，因此，“机器是否能像人类一样设计？”成为了一个开放性问题。为了拓展机器设计的边界，本研究提出了一种新的人工智能方法，利用该方法实现了自动设计一个中央处理器(CPU)，即计算机的大脑，这是人类设计过的最复杂的装置之一。该方法从只有外部输入输出观测的情况下生成CPU设计的电路逻辑，该逻辑用二元推演图(BSD)表示。",
