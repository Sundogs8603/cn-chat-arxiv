    "translated_abstract": "股票选股对于投资者构建有利可图的投资组合至关重要。图神经网络（GNN）由于其在关系建模和泛化方面的强大能力，越来越受到研究人员的关注。然而，现有的GNN方法仅关注简单的股票配对关系，并不能捕捉涉及超过两个节点的复杂高阶结构模型。此外，它们只考虑技术分析因素，忽视了可能对股票趋势产生显著影响的基本分析因素。基于这些动机，我们提出了一种基于高阶图注意力网络和联合分析的股票选股方法（H-GAT）。H-GAT能够捕捉高阶结构，并同时结合基本分析因素和技术分析因素。具体而言，H-GAT的顺序层将这两种类型的因素作为长短期记忆模型的输入。H-GAT的关系嵌入层构建了一个高阶图且学习了",
