    "translated_abstract": "上下文建模和识别对于自适应移动和普适计算至关重要。移动环境中的上下文感知依赖于对上下文变化的及时反应。然而，当前的解决方案主要关注在集中式架构上处理有限的上下文信息，存在隐私泄露和缺乏个性化的风险。设备上的上下文建模和识别是一个新兴的研究趋势，可以解决这些问题。社交互动和访问位置在描述日常生活场景中起着重要作用。本文提出了一种无监督、轻量级的方法，直接在移动设备上建模用户的社交环境和位置。利用ego-network模型，系统从手机嵌入式传感器数据中提取高级、语义丰富的上下文特征。对于社交环境，该方法利用用户和设备之间的物理和网络社交互动数据。在位置方面，它优先考虑建模熟悉的地点。",
