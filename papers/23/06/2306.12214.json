Firstly, for losses with a bounded range, we present a strengthened version of Catoni's bound that holds uniformly for all parameter values. This leads to new fast rate and mixed rate bounds that are interpretable and tighter than previous bounds in the literature. Secondly, for losses with more general tail behaviors, we introduce two new parameter-free bounds: a PAC-Bayes Chernoff analogue when the loss' cumulative generating function is bounded, and a bound when the loss' second moment is bounded. These two bounds are obtained using a new technique based on a discretization of the space of possible events for the \"in probability\" parameter optimization problem. Finally, we extend all previous results to anytime-valid bounds using a simple technique applicable to any existing bound.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对不同类型的损失提出了新的高概率PAC-Bayes界限。首先，针对有界范围的损失，我们提出了Catoni界的加强版本，适用于所有参数值的统一界。这导致了新的快速速率和混合速率上限，这些上限可解释性强且比文献中先前界限更紧。其次，针对更一般的尾部行为的损失，我们引入了两个新的无参数上限：当损失的累积生成函数有界时，我们引入了一个PAC-Bayes Chernoff类比，另一个上限是损失的二阶矩有界。这两个上限是利用一种基于可能事件空间的离散化的新技术获得的，“在概率”参数优化问题。最后，我们使用一种适用于任何现有界限的简单技术将所有先前结果扩展到任何时间有效的上限。",
