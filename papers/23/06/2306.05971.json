    "translated_abstract": "合作动力学是我们理解许多生命和复杂系统中现象的核心，包括向多细胞的过渡、昆虫群体中共同生活方式的出现以及完整人类社会的发展。然而，我们缺乏一种普遍机制来解释合作跨长度尺度、跨物种的出现，并且可扩展到大量个体的人口。我们提出了一个新的框架，通过结合反应网络、量子力学、随机复杂系统方法、博弈论和分子反应的随机模拟来建模具有任意数量玩家的合作游戏。利用这个框架，我们提出了一种基于风险规避的新型、强大的机制，这种机制可以在人口中导致合作行为。个体不是寻求在长期内最大化回报，而是寻求在有限的时间内，以某个特定的置信水平和一组最低资源来压低风险。",
