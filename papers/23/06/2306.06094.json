    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型(LLMs)在自然语言理解和生成方面取得了显著进展。然而，它们在计算机视觉领域的潜力仍然很大程度上没有被开发。本文介绍了一种新的探索性方法，使得LLMs能够使用可伸缩矢量图(SVG)格式处理图像。通过利用基于XML的SVG表述的文本描述而不是光栅图像，我们旨在弥合视觉和文本模态之间的差距，使LLMs能够直接理解和操作图像，而无需使用参数化的视觉组件。我们的方法仅利用LLMs的能力进行简单的图像分类、生成和上下文学习。我们展示了方法在判别和生成任务中的优异表现，重点介绍了它(i)对分布转移的鲁棒性，(ii)通过利用LLMs的上下文学习能力实现的显著改进，以及(iii)图像杂乱程度上的显著性能提高。",
