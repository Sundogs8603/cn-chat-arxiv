CL enables a system to learn new tasks without severe interference to its performance on old tasks, i.e., overcome the problems of catastrophic forgetting. In joint learning, it is well known that the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem caused by intentional attacks or environmental perturbations will severely impair the ability of networks to generalize. In this work, we reported a special form of catastrophic forgetting raised by the OOD problem in continual learning settings, and we named it out-of-distribution forgetting (OODF). In continual image classification tasks, we found that for a given category, introducing an intra-class distribution shift significantly impaired the recognition accuracy of CL methods for that category during subsequent learning. Interestingly, this phenomenon is special for CL as the same level of distribution shift had only negligible effects",

    "translated_abstract": "连续学习是让人工神经网络在开放环境中工作的重要技术。在联合学习中，人们已经知道由意图攻击或环境扰动引起的越界问题严重影响网络的泛化能力。在这项工作中，我们报告了连续学习设置中由越界问题引起的一种特殊形式的灾难性遗忘，我们将其称为越界遗忘（OODF）。在连续图像分类任务中，我们发现，针对给定类别，引入类内分布转移显着削弱了后续学习过程中该类别的连续学习方法的识别准确率。有趣的是，这种现象对于连续学习而言是特殊的，因为同样级别的分布转移只有微不足道的影响。",
