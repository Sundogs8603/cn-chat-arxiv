    "translated_abstract": "谷物占据着全球人口消费的50%以上，军事冲突、流行病、气候变化和飙升的谷物价格都对粮食安全产生重要影响。然而，全球谷物现货市场的复杂价格行为尚未得到很好的理解。最近的一项研究对谷物和油籽指数（GOI）及其小麦、玉米、大豆、稻米和大麦的子指数进行了多重分形移动平均分析（MF-DMA），结果发现只有玉米和大麦子指数表现出内在多重分形特性。本文利用多重分形波动分析（MF-DFA）研究同一问题。广泛的统计测试确认了玉米和大麦子指数中存在内在多重分形性，并证明了小麦和稻米子指数中不存在内在多重分形性。与MF-DMA结果不同，MF-DFA结果表明GOI和大豆中也存在内在多重分形性。",
