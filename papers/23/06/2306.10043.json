    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在决策过程中的广泛应用引发了有关其对社会的利益的问题。本研究指出并分析了三个明显影响机器学习产品发展轨迹的异质性轴，它们是：价值观、文化和法规、数据组成以及资源和基础设施能力。我们展示了这些轴如何相互依存并相互影响，强调需要共同考虑和解决它们的必要性。不幸的是，目前的研究景观在这方面还有所不足，往往未能采用整体性方法。我们检查了偏向少数人的支配性偏见和方法学，以及由此导致的权力集中、同质化控制和增加的依赖性。我们讨论了这种三个轴的片面研究构成的显著挑战，导致一个缺乏反映现实情况的实际解荐空间。",

The need to address these jointly is emphasized, with the challenges posed by fragmented research practices also discussed, including issues such as power concentration and increased dependency."
