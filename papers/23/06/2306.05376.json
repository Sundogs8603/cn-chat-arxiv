    "abstract": "The definition of anomaly detection is the identification of an unexpected event. Real-time detection of extreme events such as wildfires, cyclones, or floods using satellite data has become crucial for disaster management. Although several earth-observing satellites provide information about disasters, satellites in the geostationary orbit provide data at intervals as frequent as every minute, effectively creating a video from space. There are many techniques that have been proposed to identify anomalies in surveillance videos; however, the available datasets do not have dynamic behavior, so we discuss an anomaly framework that can work on very high-frequency datasets to find very fast-moving anomalies. In this work, we present a diffusion model which does not need any motion component to capture the fast-moving anomalies and outperforms the other baseline methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "异常检测的定义是识别意外事件。使用卫星数据实时检测极端事件（如野火、气旋或洪水）在灾害管理中变得至关重要。尽管有几个地球观测卫星提供有关灾害的信息，但地球静止轨道上的卫星每分钟能够提供数据，从实质上创建了太空视频。已经提出了许多技术来识别监视视频中的异常，然而可用的数据集没有动态行为，所以我们讨论了一种异常框架，可以处理非常高频的数据集以查找非常快速移动的异常。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种扩散模型，它不需要任何运动组件来捕捉快速移动的异常，且表现优于其他基线方法。",
