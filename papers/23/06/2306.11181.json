    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a new criterion, \"insufficiently justified disparate impact\" (IJDI), for assessing whether recommendations (binarized predictions) made by an algorithmic decision support tool are fair. Our novel, utility-based IJDI criterion evaluates false positive and false negative error rate imbalances, identifying statistically significant disparities between groups which are present even when adjusting for group-level differences in base rates. We describe a novel IJDI-Scan approach which can efficiently identify the intersectional subpopulations, defined across multiple observed attributes of the data, with the most significant IJDI. To evaluate IJDI-Scan's performance, we conduct experiments on both simulated and real-world data, including recidivism risk assessment and credit scoring. Further, we implement and evaluate approaches to mitigating IJDI for the detected subpopulations in these domains.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出一种新的标准“不充分的理由落差”（IJDI），用于评估由算法决策支持工具做出的建议（二元预测）是否公平。我们的实用型IJDI标准评估假阳性和假阴性误差率的不平衡性，识别出即使在调整群体基础比率差异的情况下仍存在的群体间显著差异。我们描述了一种新的IJDI-Scan方法，可以有效地识别跨越数据的多个观察属性的交叉子人群，其中具有最重要的IJDI。为了评估IJDI-Scan的性能，我们在模拟和真实世界的数据上进行了实验，包括再犯风险评估和信用评分。此外，我们实现和评估了在这些领域检测到的子人群上减轻IJDI的方法。",
