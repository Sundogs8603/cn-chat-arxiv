    "translated_abstract": "质量多样性算法旨在搜索大量各异且性能优越的解集，而不是一组局部最优解。尽管早期的质量多样性算法将目标和描述符函数视为黑盒函数，但引入了新工具以利用梯度信息，加速搜索并提高这些算法在连续输入空间上的整体性能。然而，广泛的应用涉及离散空间，例如药物发现或图像生成。探索这些空间具有挑战性，因为它们的组合规模很大，并且不能像连续空间那样使用梯度。我们使用具有梯度信息的离散发射器的 Map-Elites（ME-GIDE）扩展了对离散搜索空间的 QD 优化，该方法利用目标和描述符函数相对于其离散输入的梯度信息来提出梯度信息选择的解集。我们在一些离散基准问题上评估了 ME-GIDE，证明它优于将搜索空间视为黑盒的经典质量多样性算法。",
