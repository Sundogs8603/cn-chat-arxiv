    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies come with a variety of tokenomic policies as well as aspirations of desirable monetary characteristics that have been described by proponents as 'sound money' or even 'ultra sound money.' These propositions are typically devoid of economic analysis so it is a pertinent question how such aspirations fit in the wider context of monetary economic theory. In this work, we develop a framework that determines the optimal token supply policy of a cryptocurrency, as well as investigate how such policy may be algorithmically implemented. Our findings suggest that the optimal policy complies with the Friedman rule and it is dependent on the risk free rate, as well as the growth of the cryptocurrency platform. Furthermore, we demonstrate a wide set of conditions under which such policy can be implemented via contractions and expansions of token supply that can be realized algorithmically with block rewards, taxation of consumption and burning the proceeds, and blockchain oracles.",

    "translated_abstract": "加密货币带来了各种不同的代币经济政策，并且拥有被支持者描述为“健全货币”甚至“超级健全货币”的可取特征。然而，这些主张通常缺乏经济分析，因此问题在于这些愿景如何符合更广阔的货币经济理论背景。在本研究中，我们开发了一个框架，用于确定加密货币的最优代币供应政策，并研究了如何通过算法实施这种政策。我们的研究结果表明，最优政策遵循弗里德曼规则，并取决于无风险利率以及加密货币平台的增长。此外，我们还通过代币供应的收缩和扩张（可以通过区块奖励、消费税和销毁收益以及区块链预言机实现）来演示实施这种政策的一系列条件。",
