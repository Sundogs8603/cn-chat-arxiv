    "abstract": "Current Machine Translation systems achieve very good results on a growing variety of language pairs and data sets. However, it is now well known that they produce fluent translation outputs that often can contain important meaning errors. Quality Estimation task deals with the estimation of quality of translations produced by a Machine Translation system without depending on Reference Translations. A number of approaches have been suggested over the years. In this paper we show that the parallel corpus used as training data for training the MT system holds direct clues for estimating the quality of translations produced by the MT system. Our experiments show that this simple and direct method holds promise for quality estimation of translations produced by any purely data driven machine translation system.",

    "translated_abstract": "当前的机器翻译系统在越来越多的语言对和数据集上取得了非常好的结果。然而，众所周知它们产生的流畅翻译输出往往可能包含重要的意义错误。质量估计任务是在不依赖参考翻译的情况下，对由机器翻译系统生成的翻译质量进行估计。多年来，提出了许多方法。本文表明，用于训练机器翻译系统的平行语料库对于估计机器翻译系统生成的翻译质量具有直接线索。我们的实验结果表明，这种简单直接的方法对于任何纯数据驱动的机器翻译系统产生的翻译质量评估具有潜力。",
