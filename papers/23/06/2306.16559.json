    "abstract": "High-dimensional datasets depict a challenge for learning tasks in data mining and machine learning. Feature selection is an effective technique in dealing with dimensionality reduction. It is often an essential data processing step prior to applying a learning algorithm. Over the decades, filter feature selection methods have evolved from simple univariate relevance ranking algorithms to more sophisticated relevance-redundancy trade-offs and to multivariate dependencies-based approaches in recent years. This tendency to capture multivariate dependence aims at obtaining unique information about the class from the intercooperation among features.

    "translated_abstract": "高维数据对数据挖掘和机器学习中的学习任务构成了挑战。特征选择是处理维度缩减的一种有效技术，通常是在应用学习算法之前的重要数据处理步骤。在过去几十年中，过滤特征选择方法从简单的单变量相关性排序算法发展到更复杂的相关性-冗余权衡和基于多元依赖性的方法。这种捕捉多变量依赖的趋势旨在通过特征间的互相合作获取关于类别的独特信息。本文对辅助特征间协作的过滤特征选择方法的最新研究工作进行了全面的调查，并总结了文献中不同方法的贡献。此外，还介绍了当前存在的问题和挑战，以确定未来有前景的研究和发展方向。",
