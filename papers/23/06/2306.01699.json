    "translated_abstract": "数据采集方法不足或不具代表性常导致身份组不平衡，形成数据集代表性偏见。这种偏见可能存在于一个或多个受保护属性的不同组之间，并可能导致对某些人群的偏见和歧视性结果。该论文提出了一种数据扩充方法MASC，利用亲和性聚类平衡目标数据集的非保护组和保护组表征。通过将同一保护属性的实例从相似数据集中进行聚类，共享来自受保护属性的实例。该方法包括通过量化数据集间的分布差异构建亲和矩阵，并将其转换为对称成对相似性矩阵。使用非参数的谱聚类算法对目标数据集进行分类。",

By utilizing instances of the same protected attributes from similar datasets, the proposed method addresses the issue of representation bias by constructing an affinity matrix using pairwise distribution discrepancies and clustering the target dataset using non-parametric spectral clustering algorithm."
