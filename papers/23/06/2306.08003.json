    "translated_abstract": "光伏能源在全球的应用增加表明，光伏电厂的寿命和维护直接依赖于快速检测光伏电厂的严重故障的能力。为了解决这个检测问题，文献中提出了基于数据的方法。然而，这些之前的解决方案只考虑了一个或少数几个故障的具体行为。其中大多数方法可以被归为监督学习，需要大量标记努力（每种技术中明确识别的故障类型）。此外，大多数方法在PV电池或一个PV模块中验证。这在考虑它们的复杂性的大规模PV电厂中很难应用。相反，一些基于数据的无监督知名方法尝试检测异常，但不能精确地识别故障类型。其中表现最好的方法成功地将健康面板有效地分组并将其与故障面板分开。因此，本文提出了一个无监督聚类技术的方法，用于大规模PV电厂的一般故障检测。具体而言，对PV电厂中每个面板的时间序列数据集应用了k-means聚类算法。为了提高聚类性能，采用了一种广泛使用的相似性度量，即动态时间规整（DTW）距离，以克服PV面板对不同环境和操作条件的响应的变异性。实验结果表明，所提出的方法可以成功检测PV电厂中的故障并识别其类型。",
