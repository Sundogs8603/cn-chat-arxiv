    "translated_abstract": "最近，像ViT（视觉变换器）和ResNet这样的编码器已经在大规模数据集上进行训练，并且被用作比较草图和图像的知觉度量，以及零-shot环境中的多域编码器。然而，关于这些编码器的细粒度量化工作尚有有限的努力。我们的工作通过关注个体3D实例的多模态2D投影来填补这一空白。这个任务对于检索和基于草图建模具有重要的影响。我们发现，在零-shot环境中，草图越抽象，错误图像匹配的可能性越高。即使在同一个草图领域中，以不同的风格绘制的同一物体的草图，例如由不同的个体绘制，也可能无法准确匹配。我们研究的一个关键发现是，在一类3D形状上进行细致的微调可以提高其他形状类别的性能，达到或超过监督方法的准确性。我们进行了比较和讨论。",
