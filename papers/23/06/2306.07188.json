    "translated_abstract": "在线经济中，学习排序方法对用户和物品提供者至关重要。LTR模型的公平性对于按比例分配曝光至关重要。当具有相同相关性的项接收略有不同的分数时，确定性排名模型可能导致不公平的曝光分配。随机LTR模型，包括Plackett-Luce（PL）模型，解决了公平性问题，但在计算成本和性能保证方面存在局限性。为了克服这些局限性，我们提出了公平LTR-RC，一种新的后置模型无关方法。公平LTR-RC利用预先训练的评分函数创建随机LTR模型，消除了昂贵的训练需求。此外，公平LTR-RC使用无分布式风险控制框架对用户指定的效用提供有限的样本保证。通过另外结合Thresholded PL（TPL）模型，我们能够在效用和公平之间实现有效的权衡。实验结果显示，FairLTR-RC在公平性和效用性指标上优于现有方法。",

FairLTR-RC incorporates the Plackett-Luce model and Thresholded PL model to address fairness issues in learning to rank methods, and outperforms existing approaches in both fairness and utility metrics."
