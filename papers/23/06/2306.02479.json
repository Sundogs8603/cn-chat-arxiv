    "translated_abstract": "传染效应指的是社交网络中同伴行为对个体结果的因果影响。在观察研究中估计传染效应的显著方法通常假设没有未测量的混杂因素，但由于潜在的同质性，传染可能会被混淆：同质网络中的节点倾向于与具有相似属性的同伴建立联系，并且可以在不互相影响的情况下表现出相似的行为。解决潜在同质性的一种方法是考虑未观察混杂因素的代理变量。然而，在存在高维代理变量时，基于代理的方法可能会导致传染效应估计的严重偏差，正如我们在本文中演示的那样。为解决这个问题，我们引入了新颖的近邻嵌入（ProEmb）框架，该框架将变分自动编码器（VAEs）和对抗网络集成在一起，生成不同处理组高维代理变量的平衡低维表示，并且在因果推论中考虑了传染效应的估计偏差。",
