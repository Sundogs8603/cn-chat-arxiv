    "translated_abstract": "大多数对仇恨言论检测的研究都关注于英语，因为有大量的标记训练数据可供使用。但是，为了将仇恨言论检测扩展到更多的语言，需要采用需要最少训练数据的方法。本文研究了自然语言推理（NLI）模型在仅有少量标记数据的目标语言中是否能对仇恨言论检测的性能有所提升。我们在五种语言上进行了评估，结果显示NLI微调在目标语言中对于直接微调相比有显著的性能改进。然而，之前提出的在英语数据上进行中间微调的方法的有效性很难匹配。只有在English训练数据与测试领域不匹配时，我们自定义的NLI配方才能胜过中间英语微调。基于我们的广泛实验，我们提出了一系列有效利用NLI模型在标记数据有限的语言中进行仇恨言论检测的建议。",
