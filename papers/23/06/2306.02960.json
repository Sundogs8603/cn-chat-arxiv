    "translated_abstract": "在机器人领域，事件相机正在成为传统基于帧的相机的低功耗替代品，用于捕捉高速运动和高动态范围场景。这是由于它们的稀疏和异步事件输出。尖峰神经网络（SNNs）以其异步事件驱动的计算，显示出从这些事件流中提取时空特征的巨大潜力。相比之下，标准模拟神经网络（ANNs）未能有效处理事件数据。然而，由于具有额外的可训练参数（阈值和泄漏）、在更深层次上消失的尖峰以及不可微分的二值激活函数，训练SNNs是困难的。此外，在SNNs中，负责跟踪时间信息的额外数据结构——膜电位，必须在每个时间步获取和更新。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的SNN-ANN混合",
