    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体上充斥着充满仇恨的内容，其中很多经常伴随着语言和主题的多样性。用于仇恨言论检测的基准数据集没有考虑到这种背离，因为它们主要是使用仇恨词汇编制的。然而，在中立的恶意内容中捕捉仇恨信号变得具有挑战性。因此，设计模拟仇恨现实世界变异性的模型和数据集需要进一步研究。为此，我们提出了GOTHate，这是一个综合了不同语言和主题的大规模代码混合众包数据集，用于从Twitter中检测仇恨言论，包括约51k个帖子。我们详细比较了GOTHate和现有仇恨言论数据集，突出了它的新颖性，并使用10个最近的基准线对其进行了基准测试。我们的广泛实证和基准测试实验表明，在纯文本环境下，很难对GOTHate进行分类。因此，我们研究了如何添加内生信号以增强模型的性能。",
