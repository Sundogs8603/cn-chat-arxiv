    "abstract": "Effective speech emotional representations play a key role in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) and Emotional Text-To-Speech (TTS) tasks. However, emotional speech samples are more difficult and expensive to acquire compared with Neutral style speech, which causes one issue that most related works unfortunately neglect: imbalanced datasets. Models might overfit to the majority Neutral class and fail to produce robust and effective emotional representations. In this paper, we propose an Emotion Extractor to address this issue. We use augmentation approaches to train the model and enable it to extract effective and generalizable emotional representations from imbalanced datasets. Our empirical results show that (1) for the SER task, the proposed Emotion Extractor surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline on three imbalanced datasets; (2) the produced representations from our Emotion Extractor benefit the TTS model, and enable it to synthesize more expressive speech.",

    "translated_abstract": "有效的语音情感表示对于语音情感识别（SER）和情感语音合成（TTS）任务至关重要。然而，情感语音样本比中性样式语音更难以获取且成本更高，这导致一个问题，即大多数相关工作不幸地忽略了不平衡的数据集。这导致模型可能过度拟合于大多数中性类别并无法产生强健和有效的情感表示。本文提出了一种情感提取器以解决这个问题。我们使用增强方法训练模型，并使其能够从不平衡的数据集中提取出有效且具有可泛化性的情感表示。我们的实证结果表明：（1）对于SER任务，该情感提取器在三个不平衡数据集上超过了现有的基线模型；（2）从我们的情感提取器产生的表示有利于TTS模型，并使之能够合成更具表现力的语音。",
