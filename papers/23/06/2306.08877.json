    "translated_abstract": "文本条件的图像生成模型常常在实体和其视觉属性之间生成错误的关联。这反映了在提示中的实体和修饰符的语言绑定以及生成的图像中相应元素的视觉绑定之间的映射受到损害。例如，一个类似“一个粉色的向日葵和一个黄色的火烈鸟”的查询可能会错误地产生一张黄色的向日葵和一只粉色的火烈鸟的图像。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个名为SynGen的方法，该方法首先对提示进行句法分析以识别实体和它们的修饰符，然后使用一种新型的损失函数，鼓励交叉注意力图与语言绑定的语法一致。具体而言，我们鼓励实体和其修饰符的注意力图之间有大量的重叠，并且与其他实体和修饰符词之间的重叠很小。损失在推理过程中进行优化，无需重新训练或微调模型。对三个提示数据集进行的人工评估...",
