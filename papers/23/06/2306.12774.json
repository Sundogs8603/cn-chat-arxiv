    "abstract": "We address the problem of identifying the optimal policy with a fixed confidence level in a multi-armed bandit setup, when \\emph{the arms are subject to linear constraints}. Unlike the standard best-arm identification problem which is well studied, the optimal policy in this case may not be deterministic and could mix between several arms. This changes the geometry of the problem which we characterize via an information-theoretic lower bound. We introduce two asymptotically optimal algorithms for this setting, one based on the Track-and-Stop method and the other based on a game-theoretic approach. Both these algorithms try to track an optimal allocation based on the lower bound and computed by a weighted projection onto the boundary of a normal cone. Finally, we provide empirical results that validate our bounds and visualize how constraints change the hardness of the problem.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文解决多臂赌博问题中存在线性约束的情况下，如何在一定置信度下确定最优策略的问题。与标准的最优臂识别问题不同，这种情况下的最优策略可能不是确定性的，而是可能在多个臂之间进行混合。这种情况改变了问题的几何形状，我们通过信息论下界进行了描述。我们提出了两种相对于此设置都是渐进最优的算法，其中一个基于“跟踪停止”方法，另一个基于博弈理论的方法。这两种算法都试图跟踪基于下界计算和通过对正常锥体边界进行加权投影所获得的最优分配。最后，我们提供了实证结果，验证了我们的界限，并展示了约束如何改变问题的难度。",
