    "translated_abstract": "尽管近期在视觉AI领域有了许多成功的进展，但仍存在不同的缺点；包括缺少精确的逻辑推理、抽象的概括能力以及理解复杂和嘈杂的场景等。不幸的是，现有的基准测试数据集并不能捕捉到这些方面中的多数。深度学习数据集关注视觉复杂数据但只有简单的视觉推理任务，归纳逻辑数据集包括复杂的逻辑学习任务，但是缺乏视觉的组成部分。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了视觉逻辑学习数据集V-LoL，它无缝地结合了视觉和逻辑的挑战。值得注意的是，我们首次推出了V-LoL的第一个实例，名为V-LoL-Trains，它是符号AI中一个经典基准测试的视觉呈现，即Michalski火车问题。通过在一个通用框架内结合复杂的视觉场景和灵活的逻辑推理任务，V-LoL-Trains为研究广泛的视觉逻辑学习挑战提供了平台。",
