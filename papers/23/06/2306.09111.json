    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) enables the study of physical systems with excellent spatiotemporal resolution but suffers from severe time-scale limitations. To address this, enhanced sampling methods have been developed to improve exploration of configurational space. However, implementing these is challenging and requires domain expertise. In recent years, integration of machine learning (ML) techniques in different domains has shown promise, prompting their adoption in enhanced sampling as well. Although ML is often employed in various fields primarily due to its data-driven nature, its integration with enhanced sampling is more natural with many common underlying synergies. This review explores the merging of ML and enhanced MD by presenting different shared viewpoints. It offers a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving field, which can be difficult to stay updated on. We highlight successful strategies like dimensionality reduction, reinforcement learning, and flow-based methods",

    "translated_abstract": "分子动力学 (MD) 可以在空间和时间上精确地研究物理系统，但是存在着严重的时间尺度限制。为了改善配置空间探索能力，已经开发了增强采样方法。然而，实施这些方法具有挑战性并且需要专业领域知识。近年来，在不同领域中使用机器学习 (ML) 技术已经显示出了潜力，因此在增强采样中采用了这些技术。尽管 ML 主要由于其数据驱动的本质而被广泛应用于各个领域，但其与增强采样的集成更自然，共享许多共同的协同作用。本综述通过呈现不同的共享观点，探索了ML和增强MD的融合。它提供了这个快速发展领域的全面概述，这可能难以保持最新。我们突出了像降维、强化学习和基于流的方法等成功策略。",
