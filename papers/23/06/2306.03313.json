    "abstract": "The Private Equity (PE) firms operate investment funds by acquiring and managing companies to achieve a high return upon selling. Many PE funds are thematic, meaning investment professionals aim to identify trends by covering as many industry sectors as possible, and picking promising companies within these sectors. So, inferring sectors for companies is critical to the success of thematic PE funds. In this work, we standardize the sector framework and discuss the typical challenges; we then introduce our sector inference system addressing these challenges. Specifically, our system is built on a medium-sized generative language model, finetuned with a prompt + model tuning procedure. The deployed model demonstrates a superior performance than the common baselines. The system has been serving many PE professionals for over a year, showing great scalability to data volume and adaptability to any change in sector framework and/or annotation.",

    "translated_abstract": "私募股权公司通过收购和管理公司来实现高收益，许多私募股权基金是主题型的，意味着投资专业人士要覆盖尽可能多的行业板块，并在这些板块中选择有前途的公司，因此推断公司的板块对主题型私募股权基金的成功至关重要。在本文中，我们标准化行业板块框架，并讨论了典型的挑战；然后介绍了我们的板块推断系统，解决了这些挑战。具体而言，我们的系统是建立在中型生成式语言模型上的，通过Prompt+模型微调程序进行微调。部署的模型展示了比常见基线更优秀的性能。该系统已经为许多私募股权专业人员服务超过一年，并显示出对数据量的良好可扩展性和对行业板块和/或注释的任何变化的适应性。",
