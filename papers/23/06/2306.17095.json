    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了加密货币市场的时间模式，重点关注比特币、以太坊、狗狗币和Winklink从2020年1月到2022年12月的情况。通过相关矩阵形式将市场活动指标——对数收益、成交量和交易数量，每10秒采样一次，分为日内和周内周期，然后进一步分解为重复和噪声成分。主要发现包括与传统股票市场不同的市场行为，因为没有交易开放和关闭。这表现为三个增强活动阶段，分别与亚洲、欧洲和美国的交易时段相一致。还注意到了在15分钟间隔内出现的活动激增的有趣模式，尤其在整点时出现，暗示了算法交易的潜在作用。最重要的是，发现比特币和以太坊的重复活动突发与美国重大宏观经济报告发布时间重合。",
