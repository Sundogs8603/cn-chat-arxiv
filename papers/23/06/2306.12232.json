    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统在许多在线平台上起着至关重要的作用，其主要目标是满足和留住用户。由于直接优化用户保留非常具有挑战性，因此通常会采用多种评估指标。现有方法通常将这些评估指标的优化形式化为多任务学习问题，但常常忽略了用户对不同任务的偏好是个性化的并且随时间变化的事实。确定和跟踪用户偏好的演变可以改善用户保留。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了“用户生命周期”的概念，由多个阶段组成，其特征是用户对不同任务偏好的变化。我们提出了一种新颖的阶段自适应网络（STAN）框架，用于建模用户生命周期阶段。STAN首先基于学习到的用户偏好来识别潜在的用户生命周期阶段，然后利用阶段表示增强多任务学习的性能。我们在三个真实世界的数据集上的实验结果证明了STAN在提高推荐性能和用户保留方面的有效性。",
