    "abstract": "Hurricane evacuation, ordered to save lives of people of coastal regions, generates high traffic demand with increased crash risk. To mitigate such risk, transportation agencies need to anticipate highway locations with high crash risks to deploy appropriate countermeasures. With ubiquitous sensors and communication technologies, it is now possible to retrieve micro-level vehicular data containing individual vehicle trajectory and speed information. Such high-resolution vehicle data, potentially available in real time, can be used to assess prevailing traffic safety conditions.

    "translated_abstract": "飓风疏散为了拯救海岸地区的人们而进行，会导致交通需求增加，车祸风险也随之增加。为了减轻这种风险，交通机构需要预测高车祸风险的公路位置，以部署适当的对策。随着普及的传感器和通信技术，现在可以检索包含单个车辆轨迹和速度信息的微观级别车辆数据。这种高分辨率车辆数据可以在实时的情况下使用，用于评估当前的交通安全状况。利用车速和加速度曲线，可以实时预测潜在的车祸风险。以往的实时车祸风险预测研究主要使用基础设施传感器的数据，可能无法覆盖许多道路段。在本文中，我们提出了使用新兴的替代数据源（称为联网车辆数据）来确定飓风疏散期间潜在的车祸风险的方法。",
