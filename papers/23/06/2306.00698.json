    "translated_abstract": "术后并发症在医疗行业中是一个重大挑战，导致医疗费用上升和住院时间延长，少数情况下甚至会导致患者死亡。为了改善患者的预后和降低医疗费用，医疗服务提供商依赖于各种围手术期风险评分来指导临床决策和优先处理。近年来，机器学习技术在预测术后并发症和死亡方面显示出了希望，深度学习模型在医疗应用中取得了显着的成功。然而，对于术中麻醉管理数据应用深度学习模型的研究仍然很有限。在本文中，我们评估了基于Transformer的模型在预测术后急性肾衰竭、术后肺部并发症和术后住院死亡方面的性能。我们将我们的方法与最先进的表格数据预测模型进行比较，包括Gradient Boosting和LightGBM等。",
