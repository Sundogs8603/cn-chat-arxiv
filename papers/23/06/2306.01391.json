    "translated_abstract": "石脑油裂解过程严重依赖于石脑油的成分，而这是一种由不同烃类组成的复杂混合物。准确地预测石脑油成分对于有效控制裂解过程和实现最大化性能至关重要。由于需要小型试验或成本限制，传统的方法，如气相色谱和真沸点曲线分析，在实践中是不可行的。在本文中，我们提出了一种神经网络框架，利用化学性质信息来提高石脑油成分预测的性能。我们的提出框架包括两个部分：Watson K因子估计网络和石脑油成分预测网络。这两个网络共用一个基于卷积神经网络（CNN）架构的特征提取网络，而输出层使用基于多层感知器（MLP）的网络来生成两个不同的输出–Watson K因子和石脑油成分。",
