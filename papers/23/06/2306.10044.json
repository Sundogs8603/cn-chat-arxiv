This paper introduces a general-purpose system for linking entities to items in the Wikidata knowledge base. It describes how we adapt this system for linking domain-specific entities, especially for those entities embedded within tables drawn from COVID-19-related scientific literature. We describe the setup of an efficient offline instance of the system that enables our entity-linking approach to be more feasible in practice. As part of a broader approach to infer the semantic meaning of scientific tables, we leverage the structural and semantic characteristics of the tables to improve overall entity linking performance.",
