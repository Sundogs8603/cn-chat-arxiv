We develop parallel datasets of texts with masculine and feminine terms and singular \"they\" and use them to quantify gender bias in three competitive GEC systems. We contribute a novel data augmentation technique for singular \"they\" leveraging linguistic insights about its distribution relative to plural \"they\". We demonstrate that both this data augmentation technique and a refinement of a similar augmentation technique for masculine and feminine terms can generate training data that reduces bias in GEC systems, especially with respect to singular \"they\" while maintaining the same level of quality.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究发现，GEC系统在使用男性和女性术语以及性别中立的单数“they”的时候显示出性别偏见。我们开发了包含男性和女性术语以及单数“they”的文本的平行数据集，并使用它们来量化三个竞争的GEC系统中的性别偏见。针对性别中立的单数“they”，我们提出了一种基于语言学洞见的新的数据增强技术。我们证明，这种数据增强技术以及类似的针对男性和女性术语的增强技术的改进，可以生成训练数据，从而减少GEC系统的偏见，特别是在单数“they”的情况下，同时保持相同水平的质量。",
