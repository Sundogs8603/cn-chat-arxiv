    "abstract": "We describe some recent approaches to score-based explanations for query answers in databases. The focus is on work done by the author and collaborators. Special emphasis is placed on the use of counterfactual reasoning for score specification and computation. Several examples that illustrate the flexibility of these methods are shown.",
