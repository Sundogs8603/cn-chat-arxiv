    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是一种隐私保护的分布式机器学习模型，因其能保护参与者数据隐私而在物联网中引起了极大的兴趣。然而标准联邦学习存在通信效率和隐私保护方面的挑战，目前研究也不能在保障隐私的前提下同时实现通信效率和模型准确性之间的平衡。本文提出了一种基于条件随机抽样（CRS）方法的CRS-FL，并将其实现到标准FL设置中，以应对上述挑战。CRS基于泊松抽样探索随机系数，从而带来更高的零梯度无偏概率，并有效减少通信开销，同时确保模型准确性。此外，我们从理论上揭示了CRS的局部差分隐私（LDP）保证条件。广泛的实验结果表明，CRS-FL在通信效率和隐私保护方面都比提供的技术更具优势。",

The CRS method explores a stochastic coefficient based on Poisson sampling to achieve a higher probability of obtaining zero-gradient unbiasedly, effectively reducing the communication overhead without model accuracy degradation, and theoretical analysis shows the LDP guarantee conditions of CRS. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the advantages of CRS-FL over existing techniques in both communication efficiency and privacy protection."
