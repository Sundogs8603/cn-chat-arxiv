    "translated_abstract": "流行度偏差是推荐系统中的一个长期问题，对公平性和效率都带来了挑战。现有文献普遍认为，减少流行度偏差通常需要牺牲推荐准确性。在本文中，我们对这种共识提出了质疑。我们在一个通用的偏差-方差分解框架下的分析表明，在某些条件下，减少偏差实际上可以提高模型性能。为了实现这种双赢的局面，我们提出通过负采样干预模型训练，从而修改模型预测，以此来缓解流行度偏差。具体而言，我们提供了一种最优负采样规则，以最大化局部AUC，从而保持任何给定模型的准确性，同时通过修正采样信息和先前信息的方式来灵活和有原则地减少流行度偏差。我们在真实世界数据集上的实验结果显示了我们方法在提高推荐性能和减少流行度偏差方面的卓越性。",
