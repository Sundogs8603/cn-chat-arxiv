    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑在独立同分布随机激励噪声下，针对非线性和/或时变策略下的线性系统的单轨迹系统辨识问题。该问题的动机是保证基于学习的受限制线性系统的安全控制，在学习过程中的安全策略通常是非线性和时变的，以满足状态和输入限制。在本文中，我们提供了一个非渐近误差界，只要生成的状态和操作轨迹有界，该界适用于最小二乘估计中使用的任何非线性和/或时变策略下生成的轨迹。这显着推广了现有的线性系统辨识的非渐近保证，这些保证通常考虑独立同分布随机输入或线性策略。有趣的是，我们的误差界对于轨迹长度、系统维数和激励水平的依赖与线性策略相一致。最后，我们做了实验演示。",
