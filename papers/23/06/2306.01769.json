    "abstract": "Decision Support Systems for pavement and maintenance strategies have traditionally been designed as silos led to local optimum systems. Moreover, since big data usage didn't exist as result of Industry 4.0 as of today, DSSs were not initially designed adaptive to the sources of uncertainties led to rigid decisions. Motivated by the vulnerability of the road assets to the climate phenomena, this paper takes a visionary step towards introducing a Technology-Driven Adaptive Decision Support System for Integrated Pavement and Maintenance activities called TDADSS-IPM. As part of such DSS, a bottom-up risk assessment model is met via Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) to realize the actual condition of the Danish roads due to weather condition. Such model fills the gaps in the knowledge domain and develops a platform that can be trained over time, and applied in real-time to the actual event.",

    "translated_abstract": "过去，用于路面和养护战略的决策支持系统一般被设计成局部最优系统。由于工业4.0时代的大数据应用尚未出现，因此这些DSS最初并未被设计为适应不确定性来源，导致决策不够灵活。本文由于公路资产对气候现象的脆弱性，采取了具有远见的措施，引入了一种名为TDADSS-IPM（基于技术的自适应路面和养护战略决策支持系统）的综合系统。作为这种DSS的一部分，通过贝叶斯信念网络，构建了一种自下而上的风险评估模型，以了解丹麦道路由于气候条件的实际状况。这种模型填补了知识领域的空白，开发了一个平台，可以随着时间的推移进行培训，并在实际事件中进行实时应用。",
