    "translated_abstract": "机器学习技术结合海量数据集的可用性显著提高了我们探究化合物空间的能力，通过快速准确地预测分子性质。然而，大数据集的学习受到计算资源的限制，在某些情况下可能是不可行的。此外，数据集中的实例可能还没有被标记，生成标记可能成本高昂，例如量子化学计算。因此，有必要从大型未标记数据点池中选择小训练子集，并开发可靠的机器学习方法，以有效地从小训练集中学习。本文集中于预测 QM9 数据集中分子的原子化能。我们研究了采用基于领域知识的数据采样方法来进行有效训练集选择与通知机器学习技术相结合的优势。特别是，我们展示了如何最大化分子的多样性和相关性，从而提高了信息图神经网络的性能，这是一种专门为分子数据设计的机器学习算法。",
