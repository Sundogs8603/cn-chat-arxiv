    "translated_abstract": "语言通常被认为是人类思维的一个关键方面，它为我们提供了非凡的泛化、探索、规划、重新规划和适应新情况的能力。然而，强化学习（RL）代理在这些能力中远未达到人类水平的表现。我们假设其中一个认知缺陷的原因是他们缺乏使用语言思考所带来的好处。我们认为通过训练AI代理人像人类一样思考，可以改善其性能。我们引入了一种新的模仿学习框架“思维克隆”，其想法不仅是克隆人类示范者的行为，而且还包括人类在执行这些行为时所产生的想法。虽然我们希望“思维克隆”在处理网络规模的人类思维和行为数据时能够发挥出色（例如，带有剧本的在线视频），但在这里，我们进行了在思考和行动数据为合成生成的领域的实验。结果显示，“思维克隆”学习速度比传统的强化学习方法快得多。",
