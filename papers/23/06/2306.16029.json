    "translated_abstract": "移动设备上传感器产生的大量数据，结合机器学习技术的进步，支持上下文感知服务，识别用户的当前情况（即物理上下文），并优化系统的个性化功能。然而，上下文感知性能主要取决于上下文推断过程的准确性，这与大规模和标记数据集的可用性紧密相关。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一个开发的框架，用于收集包含个人移动设备导出的多样化传感数据的数据集。这个框架已经被3个志愿者用户使用了两个星期，生成了一个包含超过36K个样本和1331个特征的数据集。我们还提出了一种轻量级的方法来建模用户上下文，能够在用户移动设备上高效地执行整个推理过程。为了实现这个目标，我们使用了六种维度减少技术，以优化上下文分类过程。",
