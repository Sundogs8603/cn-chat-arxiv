    "translated_abstract": "从文本描述中生成音乐是一种用户友好的方式，因为文本是相对易于用户参与的界面。而有些方法利用文本来控制音乐音频的生成，但是编辑生成音频的音乐元素对于用户来说是具有挑战性的。相比之下，符号音乐具有易于编辑的优点，使用户更容易操作特定的音乐元素。本文介绍了MuseCoco，它利用音乐属性作为桥梁，将任务分解为文本到属性理解和属性到音乐生成的两个阶段，从而生成符号音乐。MuseCoCo代表音乐作曲副驾驶，使音乐家可以直接从给定的文本描述中生成音乐，与从头开始创作相比，大大提高了效率。该系统具有两个主要优点：数据高效。在属性到音乐生成阶段，属性可以直接进行编码，而不需要大量的音乐数据。其次，此系统具有高级别的灵活性，因为它可以通过变更文本输入来生成多样化且有个性的符号音乐。",
