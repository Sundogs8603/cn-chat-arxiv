    "translated_abstract": "Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras(PROTACs)是一类新型小分子，设计成桥梁，将E3连接酶和与疾病相关的蛋白质连接起来，从而促进其后续降解。 PROTACs由两个蛋白质结合的“活性”区域组成，由“连接”区域连接。 连接区域的设计由其相互作用给出几何和化学约束条件，并需要最大化药物样本。 为了解决这些挑战，我们介绍了ShapeLinker，一种用于全新设计链接物的方法。 它使用强化学习在自回归SMILES生成器上进行片段连接。 该方法通过结合相关的物理化学性质和一种新颖的基于注意力的点云对齐得分来对其进行优化。 这种新方法成功地生成满足相关2D和3D要求的连接剂，并在生成假定目标连接剂构造的新型连接剂方面取得了最先进的成果。",
