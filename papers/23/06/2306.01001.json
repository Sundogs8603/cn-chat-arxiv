    "abstract": "Electrical load forecasting is of great significance for the decision makings in power systems, such as unit commitment and energy management. In recent years, various self-supervised neural network-based methods have been applied to electrical load forecasting to improve forecasting accuracy and capture uncertainties. However, most current methods are based on Gaussian likelihood methods, which aim to accurately estimate the distribution expectation under a given covariate. This kind of approach is difficult to adapt to situations where temporal data has a distribution shift and outliers. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based Seq2seq structure to estimate epistemic uncertainty and use the robust additive Cauchy distribution to estimate aleatoric uncertainty. Rather than accurately forecasting conditional expectations, we demonstrate our method's ability in separating two types of uncertainties and dealing with the mutant scenarios.",

    "translated_abstract": "电力负荷预测对电力系统的决策制定，如机组投入和能源管理等具有重要意义。近年来，各种基于自监督神经网络的方法已经被应用于电力负荷预测，以提高预测准确性和捕捉不确定性。然而，大多数现有的方法是基于高斯似然方法的，它旨在在给定的协变量下准确估计分布期望值。这种方法很难适应存在分布偏移和异常值的时间数据。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于扩散的Seq2seq结构来估计本体不确定性，并使用鲁棒的加性柯西分布来估计物象不确定性。我们展示了我们的方法能够分离两种类型的不确定性并处理突变情况，而不是准确预测条件期望。",
