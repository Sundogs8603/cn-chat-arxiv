    "translated_abstract": "近年来，机器学习（ML）和人工智能社区开始对ML系统的软件工程（SE）产生越来越多的兴趣，这导致了大量旨在改善ML系统软件质量的最佳实践、规则和指南的出现。然而，对它们对整体质量的影响的理解却受到了较少的关注。这些实践通常以指导性方式呈现，没有明确地与它们对软件质量的整体贡献建立联系。基于对不同实践影响软件质量不同的观察以及单一质量方面可能由多个实践来解决的观察，我们提出了一个框架，重点关注实现的质量影响和实现优先顺序方面的最佳实践集合的分析。我们首先引入了一个专门针对ML系统量身定制的分层软件质量模型（SQM）。借助专家知识，建立了个体实践与SQM类别之间的联系。然后，我们定义了一个用于分析和优化一组最佳实践的ML系统最佳实践（MSBP）框架。该框架由五个步骤组成：（i）标识最佳实践，（ii）最佳实践的优先级排序，（iii）评估最佳实践的质量影响，（iv）最佳实践的操作化和实施，以及（v）评估。我们通过将其应用于工业ML系统的真实案例来说明该框架。我们的结果表明，该MSBP框架可用于改善ML系统的质量。",
