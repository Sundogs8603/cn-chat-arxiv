    "translated_abstract": "个性化预测是一种机器学习方法，根据过去标记观测预测一个人未来的观测值，通常用于连续任务，例如预测日常情绪评分。在进行个性化预测时，模型可以结合两种趋势：（a）跨人共享的趋势，即个人通用趋势，例如周末更开心，和（b）每个人独特的趋势，即个人特定的趋势，例如每周有一次压力大的会议。混合效应模型是一种流行的统计模型，用于通过组合个人通用和个人特定参数来研究这两种趋势。尽管现在线性混合效应模型通过将其与神经网络整合而变得越来越流行，但这种整合目前仅限于线性个人特定参数：排除非线性个人特定趋势。在本文中，我们提出了神经混合效应（NME）模型，以优化非线性个人特定参数。",
