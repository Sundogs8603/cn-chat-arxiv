    "abstract": "Application of realism enhancement methods, particularly in real-time and resource-constrained settings, has been frustrated by the expense of existing methods. These achieve high quality results only at the cost of long runtimes and high bandwidth, memory, and power requirements. We present an efficient alternative: a high-performance, generative shader-based approach that adapts machine learning techniques to real-time applications, even in resource-constrained settings such as embedded and mobile GPUs. The proposed learnable shader pipeline comprises differentiable functions that can be trained in an end-to-end manner using an adversarial objective, allowing for faithful reproduction of the appearance of a target image set without manual tuning. The shader pipeline is optimized for highly efficient execution on the target device, providing temporally stable, faster-than-real time results with quality competitive with many neural network-based methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "应用于现实增强方法，特别是在实时和资源受限制的场景中，现有方法的代价很高。这些方法只有在长时间运行和高带宽、高内存和高功率要求下才能产生高质量的结果。我们提出了一种高效替代方法：一种高性能、基于生成对抗渲染器的方法，将机器学习技术应用于实时应用程序，即使在资源受限的情况下，例如嵌入式和移动GPU。所提出的可学习渲染管道包括可微分的函数，可以使用对抗目标进行端到端训练，实现目标图像集外观的忠实再现，无需手动调整。该渲染管道针对目标设备进行了高度优化，提供时间稳定、比实际时间更快的结果，与许多神经网络方法的质量相媲美。",
