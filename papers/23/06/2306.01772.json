    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss and explore the potential and relevance of recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and digital twins for health and well-being in low-resource African countries. Using an AI systems perspective, we review emerging trends in AI systems and digital twins and propose an initial augmented AI system architecture to illustrate how an AI system can work in conjunction with a 3D digital twin. We highlight scientific knowledge discovery, continual learning, pragmatic interoperability, and interactive explanation and decision-making as important research challenges for AI systems and digital twins.",
