    "abstract": "Recent work has focused on the very common practice of prediction-based inference: that is, (i) using a pre-trained machine learning model to predict an unobserved response variable, and then (ii) conducting inference on the association between that predicted response and some covariates. As pointed out by Wang et al. [2020], applying a standard inferential approach in (ii) does not accurately quantify the association between the unobserved (as opposed to the predicted) response and the covariates. In recent work, Wang et al. [2020] and Angelopoulos et al. [2023] propose corrections to step (ii) in order to enable valid inference on the association between the unobserved response and the covariates. Here, we show that the method proposed by Angelopoulos et al. [2023] successfully controls the type 1 error rate and provides confidence intervals with correct nominal coverage, regardless of the quality of the pre-trained machine learning model used to predict the unobserved response.

    "translated_abstract": "近期的研究聚焦于基于预测的推断，即使用预先训练好的机器学习模型预测未观测到的响应变量，然后对该预测响应与某些协变量之间的关系进行推断。然而，将标准推断方法应用于该过程并不能准确量化未观测到（而非预测到）响应与协变量之间的关系。最近，Wang等人（2020）和Angelopoulos等人（2023）提出了修正（ii）步骤的方法，以实现对未观测到响应和协变量之间关系的有效推断。本文表明，Angelopoulos等人（2023）提出的方法成功地控制了第一类错误率，并提供了具有正确命名覆盖的置信区间，无论预先训练的机器学习模型用于预测未观测到的响应的质量如何。然而，我们也发现在某些情况下，所提出的方法具有低功率。",
