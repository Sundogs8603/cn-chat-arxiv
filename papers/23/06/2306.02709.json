    "translated_abstract": "基于状态的维护在液压系统中变得越来越重要。然而，这些系统的异常检测仍然具有挑战性，特别是由于异常数据很少，标记这些数据是费时费力甚至危险的。因此，建议使用无监督或半监督方法，特别是对于只有少量标签可用的情况下利用无监督学习作为特征提取机制来辅助监督学习的半监督学习方法。本研究系统地比较了在液压状态监测系统中应用的半监督学习方法用于异常检测。首先，进行了深入的数据分析和特征学习，以了解开源的液压状态监测数据集。然后，实施和评估了各种方法，包括传统的独立半监督学习模型（例如，一类支持向量机、鲁棒协方差）、集成模型（例如，孤立森林）和基于深度学习的模型（例如，自动编码器、图卷积网络）。结果表明，深度学习模型优于传统模型，而集成模型可以进一步提高检测性能。",
