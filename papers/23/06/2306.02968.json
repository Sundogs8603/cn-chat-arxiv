    "abstract": "We introduce $\\texttt{time_interpret}$, a library designed as an extension of Captum, with a specific focus on temporal data. As such, this library implements several feature attribution methods that can be used to explain predictions made by any Pytorch model. $\\texttt{time_interpret}$ also provides several synthetic and real world time series datasets, various PyTorch models, as well as a set of methods to evaluate feature attributions. Moreover, while being primarily developed to explain predictions based on temporal data, some of its components have a different application, including for instance methods explaining predictions made by language models. In this paper, we give a general introduction of this library. We also present several previously unpublished feature attribution methods, which have been developed along with $\\texttt{time_interpret}$.",
