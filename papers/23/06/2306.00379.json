    "translated_abstract": "电子商务网站（如亚马逊）在其产品页面上有大量的结构化和非结构化信息（文本和图片）。销售者往往不对其产品的属性（如颜色，尺码等）进行标注或标注有误。从既包含文本又包含图片的电子商务产品页面中自动识别这些属性值是一项具有挑战性的任务，尤其是当目录中未明确提及属性值时。本文提出了一个可扩展的解决方案，将属性提取问题作为问答任务，使用MXT（Multimodal Adaptation Gate，Xception网络和T5编码器-解码器的三个关键组件）解决。我们的系统包括一个生成模型，通过利用产品的文本和视觉特征（例如图像）来“生成”给定产品的属性值。我们展示了我们的系统在三个公开数据集上优于现有最先进方法，平均提高7.3％，并且可以在单个GPU上每秒提取12K个以上的属性。",
