    "translated_abstract": "在联邦学习中，客户端通常具有先验未知的不同参与率，如果不适当处理，则可能会对联邦学习的性能造成重大影响。现有的解决方法通常基于全局方差缩减，这需要大量额外的内存，其乘法因子等于客户总数。一个重要的未解决问题是找到一种轻量级方法来处理具备不同参与率客户的联邦学习。在这篇论文中，我们通过根据每个客户的参与历史来调整联邦平均（FedAvg）中的聚合权重来解决此问题。我们首先展示了在具有异构参与概率的情况下，非最优聚合权重的FedAvg可能会从原始FL目标的最优解偏离，这表明需要找到最优聚合权重。然而，当参与概率不可知时计算最优权重非常困难。",
