    "translated_abstract": "尽管文本到图像扩散模型在图像生成任务中表现出色，但最近的研究提出了一个问题，即生成的图像有时无法捕捉到文本提示的预期语义内容，这种现象通常被称为语义错位。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的基于能量的模型（EBM）框架。具体而言，我们首先在去噪自编码器的每个交叉注意力层中制定潜在图像表示和文本嵌入的EBM。然后，我们获得上下文向量的对数后验梯度，可以更新和转移到后续的交叉注意力层，从而隐式地最小化嵌套层次的能量函数。我们的潜在EBMs还允许零样本组合生成，即通过不同上下文的交叉注意力输出的线性组合。通过大量实验，我们证明了所提出的方法在处理各种图像生成任务方面非常有效，并可以显著降低文本提示和生成图像之间的语义错位现象。",
