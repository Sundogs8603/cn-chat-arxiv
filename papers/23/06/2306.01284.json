    "abstract": "The economic shocks that followed the COVID-19 pandemic have brought to light the difficulty, both for academics and policy makers, of describing and predicting the dynamics of inflation. This paper offers an alternative modelling approach. We study the 2020-2023 period within the well-studied Mark-0 Agent-Based Model, in which economic agents act and react according to plausible behavioural rules. We include in particular a mechanism through which trust of economic agents in the Central Bank can de-anchor. We investigate the influence of regulatory policies on inflationary dynamics resulting from three exogenous shocks, calibrated on those that followed the COVID-19 pandemic: a production/consumption shock due to COVID-related lockdowns, a supply-chain shock, and an energy price shock exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By exploring the impact of these shocks under different assumptions about monetary policy efficacy and transmission channels, we review various explanation",

    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19带来的经济冲击凸显了描述和预测通胀动态的困难，本文提供了一种替代建模方法。我们使用经过良好研究的Mark-0智能体模型，研究2020-2023年的情况，并包括一种机制，使经济主体对中央银行的信任可以解除。我们研究了监管政策对由COVID-19引发的三种外部冲击所导致的通胀动态的影响：由COVID相关封锁引起的生产/消费冲击、供应链冲击以及俄罗斯入侵乌克兰加剧的能源价格冲击。通过在不同的货币政策效力和传导渠道的假设下探究这些冲击的影响，我们回顾了各种解释。",
