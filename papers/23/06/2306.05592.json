    "translated_abstract": "为了使联邦学习模型表现良好，拥有多样化和有代表性的数据集是至关重要的。然而，数据贡献者可能只关心特定人群子集的表现，这可能无法反映更广泛人口的多样性。这导致了PRINCIPAL（FL平台设计者）关心全局表现与AGENTS（数据收集者）关心局部表现之间的紧张关系。本研究将这种紧张关系形式化为PRINCIPAL与多个AGENTS之间的博弈，并针对线性试验设计问题来研究它们的交互。我们展示了用于量化数据多样性的统计标准以及所选择的联邦学习算法对结果平衡的影响。我们利用这一点来设计简单的最优联邦学习机制，以鼓励数据收集者贡献代表全局人口的数据。",
