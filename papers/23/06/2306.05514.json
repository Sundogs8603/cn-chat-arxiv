    "translated_abstract": "生物学大脑年龄的确定是评估神经系统疾病和了解衰老期间形态学变化的重要生物标志物。提出了各种机器学习模型来通过健康控制者的磁共振成像(MRI)来估计脑龄。然而，由于选择适当的MRI特征和MRI获取成本高昂，开发强大的脑龄估测(BAE)框架一直是具有挑战性的。本文使用OpenBHB数据集提出了一种新的BAE框架，该数据集是一个新的多站点和公开可用的基准数据集，包括来自6至86岁之间3965名健康受试者的T1加权(T1-w)脑MRI扫描的区域特征。我们的方法集成了三种不同的MRI区域特征和不同的回归模型，从而实现高精度的脑龄估计，平均绝对误差(MAE)为3.02岁，预测和实际年龄之间的相关系数(r)为0.96。我们的框架在外部验证以及对不同MRI采集协议的概括方面高度鲁棒，预计在临床和研究领域具有广泛的应用。",
