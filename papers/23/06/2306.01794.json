    "translated_abstract": "蛋白质在生物功能中起着关键作用，它们的三维结构对于决定它们的功能至关重要。准确地预测给定骨架的蛋白质侧链的构象对于蛋白质结构预测、设计和蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用等应用非常重要。传统方法计算复杂度高，准确度有限，而现有的机器学习方法将问题视为回归任务，忽略了因常量共价键长度和角度所限制而带来的问题。在本研究中，我们提出了DiffPack，这是一个扭转扩散模型，通过在扭曲空间上进行扩散和去噪，学习侧链扭转角度的联合分布，这是侧链包装中唯一的自由度。为了避免同时扰动所有四个扭转角度带来的问题，我们建议从\\c {hi}1到\\c {hi}4自回归生成四个扭转角度，并训练扩散模型。",
