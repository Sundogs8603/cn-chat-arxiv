    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在具有赌博反馈的随机环境中进行顺序决策模型选择，其中元学习器可以使用一组基本学习器，并根据每个基本学习器推荐的策略动态决策。我们通过遗憾平衡来执行模型选择，但与此相关的最近文献不同的是，我们没有假设任何关于基本学习器的先验知识，如候选遗憾保证；相反，我们以数据驱动的方式揭示这些数量。因此，元学习器能够利用每个基本学习器在给定的学习环境中产生的实际遗憾（而不是期望遗憾），并挑选出最佳的遗憾。我们设计了两个模型选择算法，操作更为雄心勃勃的遗憾概念，并且除了通过遗憾平衡证明模型选择保证外，我们还在实验中展示了处理实际遗憾的令人信服的实际优势。",
