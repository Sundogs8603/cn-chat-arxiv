We extract two condition vectors from the real levels in an effort to control the details of the GAN's outputs. While the GANs perform well in approximating the first condition (map shape), they struggle to approximate the second condition (piece distribution). We hypothesize that this might be improved by trying out alternative architectures for both the Generator and Discriminator of the GANs.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种使用参数化生成对抗网络（GAN）为益智游戏Lily's Garden生成关卡的实验方法。我们从真实关卡中提取两个条件向量，以控制GAN输出的细节。虽然GAN在逼近第一个条件（地图形状）方面表现良好，但在逼近第二个条件（方块分布）方面却有困难。我们假设通过尝试替代GAN的生成器和判别器的架构可能会改进这一情况。",
