    "translated_abstract": "在联邦频率估计（FFE）中，多个客户端使用遵守Secure Summation(SecSum)隐私约束的服务器协议通信，共同估计其数据的频率。对于单轮FFE，研究者已知使用count sketching算法几乎可以达到基本的精度-通信复杂度平衡。但是在更实际的多轮FEE设置中，我们发现简单的count sketching算法是严格次优的。我们提出了一种新的混合sketching算法，并证明其更精确。此外，我们回答了一个基本问题：为了适应底层问题的难度，从业者应该如何设置sketch size？ 我们提出了一个两阶段的方法来解决这个问题。",
