    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了神经网络中出现理解前浪潮的预测，该现象是完美概括在出现过拟合或记忆迹象之后很长一段时间才出现。报告称，只有在特定的超参数下才能观察到理解前浪潮。这使得确定导致理解前浪潮的参数至关重要。然而，由于理解前浪潮需要大量的迭代轮数，因此寻找导致它的超参数是很耗时的。本文提出了一种低成本方法来预测理解前浪潮，而无需训练大量的迭代次数。本文通过研究前几轮的学习曲线，展示了一种可以预测后续出现理解前浪潮的方法。具体而言，如果在前几轮中出现某些振荡，那么可以期望在模型训练更长时间后出现理解前浪潮。我们提出使用学习曲线的频谱特征值来预测理解前浪潮的概率。实验结果表明，我们的方法可以高精度地预测理解前浪潮。",
