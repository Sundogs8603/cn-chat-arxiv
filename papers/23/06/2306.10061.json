The OASIS ontology -- An Ontology for Agent, Systems, and Integration of Services, presented in 2019 -- pursues the behaviouristic approach to deliver a semantic representation system and a communication protocol for agents and their commitments. This paper reports on the main modeling choices concerning the representation of agents in OASIS 2, the latest major upgrade of OASIS, and the achievement reached by the ontology since it was first introduced, in particular in the context of ontologies for blockchains.",

    "translated_abstract": "语义表示是多个应用领域的关键方法，其中多智能体系统领域也不例外。在为代理进行语义表示的方法中，一个基本实现手段是采取行为主义视角，通过描述智能体如何操作并与其同行互动。这种方法主要旨在通过与任务完成相关的心理状态来定义代理的操作能力。OASIS 本体论（一种代理、系统和服务集成的本体论），于2019年提出了这种行为主义方法，以提供智能代理及其承诺的语义表示系统和通信协议。本文报告了 OASIS 2 中有关代理表示的主要建模选择，这是 OASIS 的最新重大升级版本，并介绍了自其首次引入以来本体论在区块链本体论等领域中的应用及成就。",
