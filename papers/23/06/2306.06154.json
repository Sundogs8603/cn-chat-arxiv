    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习、多媒体和计算机视觉等领域，希亚空间深度学习正迅速引起关注。深度网络通常在欧几里得空间中运行，隐含地假设数据在规则网格上。最近的研究表明，当处理层次化数据和使用少量嵌入维度时，希亚几何提供了一个可行的深度学习基础。然而，目前没有可访问的开源库用于构建类似于众所周知的深度学习库的希亚网络模块。我们提出了HypLL, 即希亚空间深度学习库，以将希亚深度学习的进展聚集在一起。HypLL建立在PyTorch之上，特别强调其易用性设计，以吸引广泛的受众关注这个新的和开放的研究方向。代码可在以下网址找到：https://github.com/maxvanspengler/hyperbolic_learning_library。压缩文件可在以下网址找到：https://d",
