    "translated_abstract": "长期时间序列预测在各种现实场景中起着重要作用。最近的深度学习方法倾向于通过分解或采样方法捕获时间序列的结构。然而，大多数提取出的模式可能包含难以预测的噪声，并且缺乏良好的可解释性。此外，多变量序列预测方法通常忽略每个变量的个体特征，可能会影响预测精度。为了捕捉时序的内在结构，我们提出了一种名为 Multi-resolution Periodic Pattern Network（MPPN）的新型深度学习网络架构，用于长期时间序列预测。我们首先构建上下文感知的多分辨率语义单元，并采用多周期模式挖掘来捕获时间序列的关键模式。然后，我们提出了一个通道自适应模块，以捕捉多变量对不同模式的感知。",

The channel adaptive module captures the perceptions of multivariate towards different patterns. It aims to address the unpredictable noise and lack of interpretability in previous deep learning methods and also considers the individual characteristics of each variate for higher prediction accuracy."
