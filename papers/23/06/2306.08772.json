    "abstract": "NetHack is known as the frontier of reinforcement learning research where learning-based methods still need to catch up to rule-based solutions. One of the promising directions for a breakthrough is using pre-collected datasets similar to recent developments in robotics, recommender systems, and more under the umbrella of offline reinforcement learning (ORL). Recently, a large-scale NetHack dataset was released; while it was a necessary step forward, it has yet to gain wide adoption in the ORL community. In this work, we argue that there are three major obstacles for adoption: resource-wise, implementation-wise, and benchmark-wise. To address them, we develop an open-source library that provides workflow fundamentals familiar to the ORL community: pre-defined D4RL-style tasks, uncluttered baseline implementations, and reliable evaluation tools with accompanying configs and logs synced to the cloud.",

    "translated_abstract": "NetHack被认为是强化学习研究的前沿，其中基于学习的方法仍需赶上基于规则的解决方案。通过使用类似于机器人技术、推荐系统等领域最新发展中的预先收集的数据集，离线强化学习（ORL）成为突破的一个有希望的方向。最近，一个大规模的NetHack数据集被释放出，虽然这是向前迈出的必要一步，但它尚未在ORL社区中得到广泛应用。在这项工作中，我们认为有三个主要障碍需要克服：资源、实现和基准。为了解决这些问题，我们开发了一个开源库，提供了ORL社区熟悉的工作流基础：预定义的D4RL风格任务，简洁的基准实现，以及可靠的评估工具，并附有与云端同步的配置和日志。",
