    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种在非稳态设置中具有正式质量保证的自适应方法，用于对数据序列进行弱监督标记。我们的目标是通过使用提供每个数据点正确分类的独立嘈杂信号的弱监督源来推断未知标签。这种情况包括众包和编程式弱监督。我们重点研究非稳态情况，在这种情况下，弱监督源的精度可能会随时间漂移，例如由于底层数据分布的变化。由于漂移，旧数据可能会提供误导性信息来推断当前数据点的标签。以往的工作依赖于先验对漂移幅度的假设，以决定使用多少过去的数据。相比之下，我们的算法不需要任何漂移假设，而是根据输入进行自适应。特别地，在每个步骤中，我们的算法保证弱监督源当前准确度的估计。",
