    "translated_abstract": "脉冲神经网络（SNN）是可用于边缘智能的生物学合理模型，特别适用于顺序学习任务。然而，SNN的训练面临着精确的时间和空间信用分配的挑战。尽管BPTT算法是解决这些问题最常用的方法，但由于其时间依赖性，它产生了较高的计算成本。此外，BPTT及其近似仅利用从脉冲活动中导出的因果信息来计算突触更新，从而忽略了非因果关系。在这项工作中，我们提出了S-TLLR，这是一种受到Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity（STDP）机制启发的新型三因素时间局部学习规则，旨在用于事件驱动学习任务的SNN训练。S-TLLR同时考虑了前后突触之间的因果和非因果关系。",
