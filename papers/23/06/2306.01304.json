    "abstract": "Melody extraction is a core task in music information retrieval, and the estimation of pitch, onset and offset are key sub-tasks in melody extraction. Existing methods have limited accuracy, and work for only one type of data, either single-pitch or multipitch. In this paper, we propose a highly accurate method for joint estimation of pitch, onset and offset, named JEPOO. We address the challenges of joint learning optimization and handling both single-pitch and multi-pitch data through novel model design and a new optimization technique named Pareto modulated loss with loss weight regularization. This is the first method that can accurately handle both single-pitch and multi-pitch music data, and even a mix of them. A comprehensive experimental study on a wide range of real datasets shows that JEPOO outperforms state-ofthe-art methods by up to 10.6%, 8.3% and 10.3% for the prediction of Pitch, Onset and Offset, respectively, and JEPOO is robust for various types of data and instrument",

    "translated_abstract": "旋律提取是音乐信息检索中的核心任务，而音高、起始和终止的估计是旋律提取的关键子任务。现有方法的准确性有限，并且只适用于单音高或多音高数据中的一种类型。本文提出了一种名为JEPOO的高度准确的音高、起始和终止联合估计方法。我们通过新颖的模型设计和一种名为帕累托模调损失的优化技术，解决了联合学习优化和处理单音高和多音高数据的挑战。这是第一种能够准确处理单音高和多音高音乐数据，甚至混合类型数据的方法。在广泛的真实数据集上进行的全面实验研究表明，JEPOO在预测音高、起始和终止方面比最先进的方法分别高出10.6％、8.3％和10.3％，同时对于各种类型的数据和乐器具有鲁棒性。",
