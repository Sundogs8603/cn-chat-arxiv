    "translated_abstract": "解释法律开放性术语的含义是法律专业人员的重要任务。先前法院案例中该术语的应用是解释其含义的重要来源。本文评估了GPT-4生成法律术语解释的准确性、清晰性和相关性的性能。我们将GPT-4被直接要求解释法律术语的基准设置的性能与增强方法进行了比较，在增强方法中，一个法律信息检索模块被用来为模型提供相关背景，即来自案例法的句子。我们发现，直接应用GPT-4产生的解释在表面上似乎非常高质量。然而，详细分析揭示了解释的实际准确性方面存在的限制。此外，我们发现增强性能可以提高质量，并似乎消除了幻觉问题，即模型发明不正确的陈述。这些发现为在法律领域中使用大型语言模型开辟了新的途径。",
