    "translated_abstract": "合成孔径雷达（SAR）图像的理解对于遥感应用至关重要，但受其内在的噪声干扰（称为斑点）的影响。复杂的统计模型（例如$\\mathcal{G}^0$分布族）已被应用于SAR数据，许多当前在处理此类图像方面的进展都是通过从这些模型中提取信息来完成的。本文提出了一种改进$\\mathcal{G}^0$分布参数估计的方法，使用对数累积的方法进行。首先，利用贝叶斯建模，我们构建出可在$\\mathcal{G}^0_A$和$\\mathcal{G}^0_I$模型下都产生可靠粗糙度估计的方法。其次，我们利用三角函数的近似方法，在恒定的时间内计算出粗糙度估计，使其比现有方法速度快得多。最后，我们展示了如何利用这种方法基于从SAR数据中提取的粗糙度信息实现快速可靠的SAR图像理解。",
