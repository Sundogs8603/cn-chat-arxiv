    "abstract": "We design a practical algorithm for transaction ordering that takes into account both transaction timestamps and bids. The algorithm guarantees that users get their transactions published with bounded delay against a bid, while it extracts a fair value from sophisticated users that have an edge in latency, by moving expenditure from investment in latency improvement technology to bidding. The algorithm creates a score from timestamps and bids, and orders transactions based on the score. We first show that a scoring rule is the only type of rule that satisfies the independence of latency races. We provide an economic analysis of the protocol in an environment of private information, where investment in latency is made ex-ante or interim stages, while bidding happens at the interim stage where private signals have been observed. The algorithm is useful for transaction sequencing in rollups or in other environments where the sequencer has privileged access to order flows.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们设计了一个将交易时间戳和出价考虑在内的交易排序实用算法。该算法保证用户以有限的延迟时间按标的物收到他们的交易，同时从具有优势的低延迟技术的复杂用户中提取公平价值，通过将开销从投资于低延迟改进技术转移至竞标中。该算法通过时间戳和出价创建得分，根据得分排序交易。我们首先展示得分规则是唯一满足延迟竞速独立性的规则类型。我们对私人信息环境中的协议进行了经济分析，在该环境中，低延迟的投资是在事前或中间阶段进行的，竞标是在观察到私人信号的中间阶段进行的。该算法可用于Rollups或其他环境中的交易排序，其中排序器具有订单流的特权访问。",
    "tldr": "该算法为交易排序提供了一种解决方案，它结合了交易时间戳和出价，可以保证用户在有限延迟内获得公平价值，同时提取了竞争优势用户的公平价值，因此可以在Rollups和其他具有排序器特权的环境中提高交易排序的效率。",
    "en_tdlr": "The algorithm combines transaction timestamps and bids to provide a solution for transaction ordering, ensuring that users receive fair value within a limited delay, while extracting fair value from users with a competitive advantage, thus improving efficiency in transaction sequencing in Rollups and other environments with sequencer privileges."
