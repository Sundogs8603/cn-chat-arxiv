    "translated_abstract": "用户体验（UX）是人机交互（HCI）研究的一部分，专注于提高系统用户的直观性、透明度、简洁性和信任度。大多数针对机器学习（ML）或自然语言处理（NLP）的UX研究都采用数据驱动的方法，即没有关注用户需求，并仅仅将领域用户用于可用性评估。此外，更典型的UX方法是先针对用户的可用性进行定制，而不是首先了解用户需求。本文提出了一种将生成式UX研究整合到开发领域NLP应用中的方法。生成式UX研究将领域用户纳入原型开发的初始阶段，即构思和概念评估阶段，以及最后一阶段评估用户价值的变化。案例研究中，我们报道了一个针对过程工业中日常操作的领域特定语义搜索的完整原型开发过程。",
