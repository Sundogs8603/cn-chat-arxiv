    "translated_abstract": "分子的机器学习在有效探索广阔的化学空间和优化药物发现过程中具有巨大潜力，它可以促进新型治疗分子的设计。深度生成模型在分子生成方面显示出有希望的结果，但是对于学习小图分布的特定归纳偏见的好处尚不清楚。本研究旨在通过以小型药物分子为案例研究，探讨子图结构和词汇设计对分布学习的影响。为此，我们引入了一种新的基于子图的分段方案Subcover，并通过两步变分自编码器对其进行评估。我们的结果表明，Subcover对化学意义上的子图的更好鉴别，使FCD得分相对提高了30％，超过了先前的方法。我们的发现突出了Subcover提高现有方法的性能和可伸缩性的潜力，并为改进分子生成方法提供了贡献。",
