    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在存在额外的多变量观测的情况下，识别两个一维目标变量之间共享的信号的问题。传统上，基于典型相关分析（CCA）的方法被用于识别共享变量，然而，它们被设计用于多变量目标，并且对于一元情况只提供微不足道的解决方案。在多任务学习（MTL）的背景下，提出了各种模型来学习稀疏且共享的特征。然而，这些方法通常通过他们的预测性能进行评估。据我们所知，以往的研究没有系统地评估模型是否能正确地恢复共享的信号。在这里，我们形式化了一元共享信息检索的设置，并提出了ICM，一种可以在存在真实标签的情况下使用的评估指标，评估学习到的共享特征的三个方面。我们进一步提出了深度规范信息分解（DCID）方法，该方法可以将多变量目标一致扩展到一维情况。",
