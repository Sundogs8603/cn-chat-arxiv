The first retrieval mechanism, we employed, is a learning-free dense retriever and the other system is a learning-based retriever. We were able",

    "translated_abstract": "关系提取（RE）是自然语言处理（NLP）中的一个关键任务，旨在识别和分类文本中提及的实体之间的关系。在金融领域，关系提取在从财经文件（如新闻文章、盈利报告和公司申报）中提取有价值信息方面起着至关重要的作用。本文描述了我们在一个名为REFinD的数据集上进行关系提取的解决方案。该数据集是作为SIGIR 2023举办的第四届从非结构化数据中发现知识的研讨会的共享任务的一部分发布的。我们在本文中采用了OpenAI模型，并应用了上下文学习（ICL）框架。我们利用两种检索策略从训练数据中找出与给定测试示例相关的前K个上下文学习示范/示例。第一个检索机制是无需学习的密集检索器，而另一个系统是基于学习的检索器。",
