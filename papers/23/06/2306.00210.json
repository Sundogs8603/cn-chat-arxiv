    "translated_abstract": "机器学习的显著增长和重要成功将其应用扩展到了编程语言和程序分析中。然而，采用最新的机器学习方法的一个关键挑战是编程语言的表示，这直接影响了机器学习方法关于程序的推理能力。以往的表示作品中缺乏数值意识、复合数据结构信息和变量表示不当等问题限制了它们的性能。为了克服当前程序表示的限制和挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的基于图形的程序表示，称为PERFOGRAPH。 PERFOGRAPH可以通过引入新节点和边来捕获数值信息和复合数据结构。此外，我们提出了一种适应性嵌入方法来合并数值意识。这些增强使PERFOGRAPH成为高度灵活和可扩展的表示形式，可以有效地捕获程序。",
