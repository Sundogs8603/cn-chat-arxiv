    "translated_abstract": "机器学习系统的复杂性每年都在增加，当前实现的大型语言模型或文本到图像生成器具有数十亿的参数，并需要执行数十亿次算术运算。由于这些系统被广泛使用，确保它们的可靠运行正在成为设计要求。传统的错误检测机制引入了电路或时间冗余，对系统性能产生了显著影响。另一种选择是使用并发错误检测方案，这些方案与系统并行运行，并利用其属性来检测错误。并发错误检测对于大型机器学习系统非常有吸引力，因为它可以潜在地降低错误检测的成本。本文介绍了一种称为并发分类器错误检测 (CCED) 的方案，该方案使用并发机器学习分类器来检测错误并在主要机器学习系统中识别一组检查信号，并将其馈送到并发机器学习分类器中，该分类器经过训练可识别主系统的正确输出。CCED能够在不需要额外硬件或软件开销的情况下检测主系统的错误，使其成为大规模机器学习系统中错误检测的实用且高效的解决方案。",
