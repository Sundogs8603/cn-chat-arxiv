It finds that histogram estimators are optimal against Lipschitz distributions for the L2 risk and regular differential privacy, and extends this to other norms and notions of privacy. Additionally, it discovers that adding privacy can degrade the regular minimax risk of estimation on Sobolev densities in certain cases, and that projection estimators are near-optimal in this new setup with pure projection estimation."
