    "translated_abstract": "自由能原理（FEP）是一种描述系统如何通过最小化自由能泛函而自组织成具有连贯性、稳定结构（智能）的理论框架。主动推理（AIF）是FEP的一个推论，它明确了能够为未来进行规划（代理）的系统是如何通过最小化包含信息寻求组件的特定自由能泛函来运作的。本文是一个系列中的第一篇，我们在自由形式因子图上推导了AIF的合成版本。本文重点推导了AIF所使用的自由能泛函的局部版本。这使我们能够构造一个适用于任意图形模型并与有关消息传递算法的先前工作接口的AIF版本。结果消息是在我们的伴侣论文中得出的。我们还发现因子图形式中存在一个缺口。虽然因子图表达了生成模型，但在指定系统目标方面缺乏一个图形化语言。我们引入了一个因子图描述法的新扩展，称为图形说明语言（GSL），它使系统目标得到明确规定。",
