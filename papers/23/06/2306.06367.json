When applied to motion interpolation, these deep learning methods have limited performance since they do not leverage the flexible dependencies between interpolation frames as the original geometric formulas do. To realize this interpolation characteristic, we propose a novel framework, referred to as \\emph{Shuffled AutoRegression}, which expands the autoregression to generate in arbitrary (shuffled) order and models any inter-frame dependencies as a directed acyclic graph.

    "translated_abstract": "本工作旨在为运动插值任务提供深度学习解决方案。以往的研究使用几何权重函数解决这个问题。其他一些工作则提出了神经网络来处理不同的问题设置，并以连续的姿势序列作为输入。但是运动插值是一个更复杂的问题，它将孤立的姿势（例如只使用一个起始姿势和一个结束姿势）作为输入。当应用于运动插值时，这些深度学习方法的性能有限，因为它们无法利用原始几何公式中的灵活依赖关系。为了实现这种插值特性，我们提出了一种新的框架，称为“洗牌自回归”，它将自回归扩展到任意（洗牌）顺序生成，并将任何帧间依赖关系建模为有向无环图。我们进一步提出了一种构建特定类型依赖性图的方法，包括三个阶段组装成一个模型。",
