    "translated_abstract": "为了保证人工智能系统的安全性和鲁棒性，我们引入拓扑视差作为比较已训练模型和参考数据集的多尺度几何结构相似性的理论和计算工具。我们的证明和例子表明，数据集和模型之间的这种几何相似性对于可信的插值和扰动至关重要，并且我们猜测，这个新概念将为深度学习应用中过拟合和泛化之间不明确的关系的当前讨论增添价值。在典型的DNN应用中，模型的显式几何描述是不可能的，但视差可以通过检查使用参考数据集的测地畸变对Rips复合体的影响来估计模型中的拓扑特征（组件、周期、空洞等）。因此，视差指示模型与数据集是否共享类似的多尺度几何特征。视差通过拓扑数据分析理论，提供了从不同角度观察数据的直观概念，并为理解深度感知模型的行为和性能提供了新的视角。",
