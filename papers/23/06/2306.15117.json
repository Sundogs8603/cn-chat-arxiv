While recent pedestrian detection models have achieved impressive performance on various datasets, they remain sensitive to shifts in the distribution of the inference data. Our method adopts and modifies Elastic Weight Consolidation to a backbone object detection network, in order to penalize the changes in the model weights based on their importance towards the initially learned task. We show that when trained with one dataset and fine-tuned on another, our solution learns the new distribution and maintains its performance on the previous one, avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种持续学习的解决方案，用于解决行人检测中的越域泛化问题。尽管最近的行人检测模型在各种数据集上取得了令人印象深刻的性能，但它们对推理数据分布的变化仍然敏感。我们的方法采用并修改了弹性权重合并方法，应用于主干目标检测网络，以惩罚对初始学习任务的重要性发生变化的模型权重。我们表明，当使用一个数据集进行训练并在另一个数据集上进行微调时，我们的解决方案能够学习新的分布并保持在先前数据集上的性能，避免了灾难性遗忘。我们在两个常用的数据集CrowdHuman和CityPersons上进行了跨数据集实验，并取得了显著的改进，分别在CrowdHuman和CityPersons数据集上降低了9%和18%的误检率。",
