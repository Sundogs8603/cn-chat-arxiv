    "translated_abstract": "开发准确和高效的蛋白质粗粒化表征对于理解它们的折叠、功能和在长时间尺度下的相互作用至关重要。我们的方法包括通过分子动力学模拟蛋白质，并利用得到的轨迹通过可微分轨迹重加权来训练神经网络势能。令人惊讶的是，该方法仅需要蛋白质的天然构象，消除了从广泛模拟或内存密集型端到端可微分模拟导出标记数据的需求。一旦训练完成，模型可以用于并行分子动力学模拟，并对训练分布内外的蛋白质进行折叠事件采样，展示其外推能力。通过应用马尔可夫状态模型，可以预测模拟蛋白质的与天然构象相似的构象。由于其理论可转移性和仅使用蛋白质的天然构象的能力，可以在不同尺度上应用该方法。",
