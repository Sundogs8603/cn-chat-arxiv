    "translated_abstract": "人类大脑通过把获得的知识和经验整合到记忆中，不断学习并迅速适应新环境。在机器学习模型中，开发这种能力被视为人工智能研究的重要目标，因为当数据有限或者需要快速适应新的未知任务时，深度神经网络表现不佳。近期提出了一些在高性能水平上表现出低数据学习特性的元学习模型，但它们不符合生物学的实现方式。我们提出了一种受到海马和前额叶皮质启发的生物可行元学习模型，使用带有奖励的学习系统的脉冲神经网络。我们的模型包括一个旨在防止灾难性遗忘的记忆，这种现象在元学习模型在新任务开始时会忘记它们所学的内容，同时我们的新模型具有在最小数据下适应新任务和快速学习连续任务的能力。提出的模型优于其他生物可行模型，并与神经生物学发现相容。",
