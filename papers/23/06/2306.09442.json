Furthermore, when such a classifier already exists, red teaming has limited marginal value because the classifier could simply be used to filter training data or model outputs.

    "translated_abstract": "部署大型语言模型（LLMs）可能会产生有害输出，例如有毒或不诚实陈述。先前的研究已经引入了工具以调查有害输出，以识别和减轻这些风险。虽然这是确保语言模型安全的有价值步骤，但这些方法通常依赖于现有的针对不希望的输出的分类器。这限制了它们在只有预先知道有害行为类型的情况下的应用。然而，这跳过了红队行动的核心挑战：开发模型可能展示的行为的上下文理解。此外，当这样的分类器已经存在时，红队行动的边际价值有限，因为分类器可以用于过滤训练数据或模型输出。本文考虑在假设对手从高级、抽象的不良行为规范出发的情况下进行红队行动。红队应该在精化/扩展此规范的同时对抗该模型。",
