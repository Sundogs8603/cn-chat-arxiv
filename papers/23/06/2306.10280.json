    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络(GNNs)已成为图表示学习的事实标准，因为它们能有效地整合图的拓扑结构和节点属性。然而，由于图的复杂和依赖形成过程导致的节点连接的固有次优性质，在对其进行建模方面存在着重大挑战。为了解决这个问题，近年来图结构学习(GSL)作为一种数据中心化学习方法已经引起了广泛关注。GSL的核心概念是同时优化图结构和对应的GNN模型。尽管提出了许多GSL方法，但由于实验协议不一致，包括数据集的变化、数据处理技术和分割策略的差异，该领域的进展仍不清楚。在本文中，我们介绍了OpenGSL，这是第一个针对GSL的综合基准测试，并旨在填补这一空白。OpenGSL提供了一个公平的比较平台，使研究人员能够在统一的设置下评估不同的GSL方法。",
