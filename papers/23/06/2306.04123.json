    "translated_abstract": "逆向合成是药物探索中预测给定目标分子反应物的重要任务。近年来，基于机器学习的逆向合成方法取得了良好的结果。本文介绍了RetroKNN，一种基于本地反应模板检索的方法，通过非参数检索进一步提高基于模板的系统性能。我们首先构建了一个原子模板存储库和一个键模板存储库，其中包含训练数据中的本地模板，然后在推理过程中使用k最近邻（KNN）搜索从这些模板中检索。检索到的模板与神经网络预测相结合作为最终输出。此外，我们还提出了一种轻量级适配器，以调整基于隐藏表示和检索模板的神经网络和KNN预测的权重。我们在两个广泛使用的基准测试USPTO-50K和USPTO-MIT上进行了全面的实验。尤其是在top-1精度方面。",
