    "translated_abstract": "语音到文本（S2T）摘要是一种节省时间的技术，可用于过滤和跟踪每天上传在线的广播新闻。最近深度学习中出现了具有出色文本生成能力的大型语言模型，引起了对产生简洁文档版本的摘要系统的研究重点，也称为抽象摘要。端到端（E2E）建模的S2T抽象摘要是一种有前途的方法，它提供了产生丰富潜在表示的可能性，这些表示利用了非语言和声学信息，而不是仅使用级联系统中自动生成的转录文本的语言信息。然而，文献中关于这项任务的E2E建模很少探索不同的领域，特别是广播新闻是一个具有挑战性的领域，每天向用户呈现大量和多样化的数据。我们采用级联翻译方法和端到端方法建模S2T摘要，并在广播新闻的新数据集上进行了评估。我们的结果显示，E2E方法具有更好的表现潜力，但需要进一步的研究来提高其在不同领域中的有效性和鲁棒性。",
