    "translated_abstract": "在发明有价值的材料和靶向治疗方面，使用已发表的科学成果训练的人工智能（AI）模型已经得到了应用，但它们通常忽略不断改变发现领域的人类科学家。在这里，我们展示了通过训练无监督模型进行模拟推理（专家认为易于理解）并纳入人类专业知识分布，可以显著改善（高达400％）AI对未来发现预测的准确性，特别是在相关文献稀缺的情况下。这些模型通过预测人类的预测和将会提出这些预测的科学家来成功。通过调整人类感知的AI以避开常规思路，我们可以产生科学上有前途、想象力带来的自然假设，并且拥有超越当前问题的科学进展潜力，这些问题直到遥远未来才可能得到解决。人类感知的人工智能可以增强科学创造力，并扩大研究问题的范围，从而加速人类发现或探索其盲点。",
