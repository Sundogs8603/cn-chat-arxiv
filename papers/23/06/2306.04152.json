    "translated_abstract": "方面情感四元预测（ASQP）是方面情感分析中具有挑战性但极具意义的子任务，因为它提供了完整的方面级情感结构。然而，现有的ASQP数据集通常很小且密度较低，阻碍了技术的进步。为了扩展能力，本文提出了两个新的ASQP数据集，具有以下特征：更大的大小，更多的单词数量和更高的密度。通过这样的数据集，揭示了现有强ASQP基线的缺陷，因此提出了一种统一的ASQP一步解决方案，即One-ASQP，以同时检测方面类别并识别方面-观点-情感（AOS）三元组。 One-ASQP具有以下几点独特的优势：（1）通过将ASQP分成两个子任务并独立同时解决它们，我们可以避免基于管道的方法中的错误传播，并克服生成性方法中的慢速训练和推理;（2）通过引入多任务学习和分层注意机制，我们可以提高方面类别和AOS三元组的预测准确性。基于基准数据集的实验结果证明了One-ASQP的有效性和效率。",
