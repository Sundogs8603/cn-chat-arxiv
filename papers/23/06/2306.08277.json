    "translated_abstract": "建模公路网络上的时空过程是一个越来越重要的任务。虽然在发展时空图神经网络（GNNs）方面取得了重要进展，但现有的工作建立在三个不适用于实际公路网络的假设基础上。首先，它们假定每个节点都配备传感器进行感知。然而在现实中，由于预算限制或传感器故障，所有位置（节点）可能没有配备传感器。其次，它们假定所有安装的传感器都具有感知历史记录。然而由于传感器故障、通信中的数据丢失等原因，这也是不现实的。最后，假设静态的道路网络。网络内连通性会由于道路封闭、新路修建等原因而发生变化。在这项工作中，我们开发了FRIGATE来解决所有这些缺点。FRIGATE由时空GNN驱动，将位置、拓扑和时间信息集成到节点表示中，用于预测。通过利用图神经网络的表现力，FRIGATE可以学习预测公路网络上时空过程的演变，而无需每个节点的感知、完整的感知历史记录或静态网络的假设。我们在真实交通数据集上评估FRIGATE，并证明其相对于现有最先进的方法具有更优异的预测性能。",
    "tldr": "FRIGATE是一种使用时空GNN进行公路网络预测的方法，可以在不依赖每个节点的感知、完整的感知历史记录或静态网络假设的情况下工作，在真实交通数据集上表现出更高的预测性能。",
    "en_tdlr": "FRIGATE is a method that uses spatio-temporal GNNs for road network prediction, which can work without relying on the sensing of every node, complete sensing history, or the static network assumption, and shows higher forecasting performance on real-world traffic datasets compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches."
