    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了RL4CO，这是一个广泛的强化学习（RL）用于组合优化（CO）的基准测试。RL4CO采用最先进的软件库和最佳实践，如模块化和配置管理，以便研究人员可以轻松修改神经网络架构、环境和算法。与现有的专注于特定任务（如旅行推销员问题）进行性能评估的方法不同，我们强调可扩展性和泛化能力对于各种优化任务的重要性。我们还系统地评估了各种模型在样本效率、零-shot泛化和适应不同数据分布方面的表现。我们的实验结果表明，一些最新的最先进方法在使用这些新指标进行评估时落后于之前的方法，这表明有必要更加平衡地评估神经CO求解器的性能。我们希望RL4CO能够为研究人员提供一个综合性的基准测试工具，以进一步推动强化学习在组合优化领域的研究。",
