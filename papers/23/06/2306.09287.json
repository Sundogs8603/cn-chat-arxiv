The paper develops posterior simulation samplers for Bayesian estimation of both univariate and VAR models of this type.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于带有随机偏度的偏正常和偏斜t震荡的随机波动模型的参数化框架，用于建模和预测宏观经济尾部风险。本文为这种类型的单变量和VAR模型开发了贝叶斯估计的后验模拟抽样器。在一个应用中，我使用这些模型来预测GDP增长的下行风险，并证明这种方法是量化回归的一个有竞争力的替代方法。最后，在美国数据上估计一个中等规模的VAR模型，我证明时变偏度是宏观经济和金融冲击的一个相关特征。",
