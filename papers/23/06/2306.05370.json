    "abstract": "The present-day Russia-Ukraine military conflict has exposed the pivotal role of social media in enabling the transparent and unbridled sharing of information directly from the frontlines. In conflict zones where freedom of expression is constrained and information warfare is pervasive, social media has emerged as an indispensable lifeline. Anonymous social media platforms, as publicly available sources for disseminating war-related information, have the potential to serve as effective instruments for monitoring and documenting Human Rights Violations (HRV). Our research focuses on the analysis of data from Telegram, the leading social media platform for reading independent news in post-Soviet regions. We gathered a dataset of posts sampled from 95 public Telegram channels that cover politics and war news, which we have utilized to identify potential occurrences of HRV. Employing a mBERT-based text classifier, we have conducted an analysis to detect any mentions of HRV in the Telegram ",

    "translated_abstract": "当今俄乌军事冲突揭示了社交媒体在直接从前线透明地、无拘无束地分享信息方面所起的关键作用。在表达自由受限、信息战争盛行的冲突地区，社交媒体已成为不可或缺的生命线。我们的研究聚焦于分析来自Telegram的数据，这是后苏联地区阅读独立新闻的主要社交媒体平台。我们收集了95个公共Telegram频道的帖子样本数据集，其中包括涵盖政治和战争新闻的帖子，利用这些数据我们可以鉴别出潜在的人权侵犯事件。通过mBERT基于文本的分类器，我们已经分析了Telegram平台上任何有关人权侵犯的提及情况。",
