    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs），特别是GPT-4，在常见的自然语言处理（NLP）任务上具有卓越的能力，还在各种专业和学术基准测试中展现出接近人类水平的性能。然而，GPT-4是否能直接用于实际应用，并替代专业领域中的传统人工智能（AI）工具，需要进一步的实验验证。本文探讨了LLMs（如GPT-4）在痴呆症诊断上胜过传统AI工具的潜力。通过对比两种工具在临床环境中的诊断准确性，全面探究了GPT-4和传统AI工具的优缺点。两个真实临床数据集上的实验结果表明，尽管像GPT-4这样的LLMs在未来的痴呆症诊断中具有潜力，但目前仍无法超过传统AI工具的性能表现。同时，本文还评估了GPT-4的解释性和可信性，同时也指出了将LLMs集成到医疗应用中面临的挑战。",
