    "translated_abstract": "汽车跟随是一种控制过程，在这种过程中，跟随车辆（FV）会调整其加速度，以保持与前车（LV）的安全距离。最近，通过真实世界的驾驶数据集，出现了许多数据驱动模型，使汽车跟随的建模更加准确。尽管有几个公共数据集可用，但它们的格式并不始终一致，这使得确定最先进的模型以及新模型的表现如何与现有模型相比变得具有挑战性。 相比之下，像图像识别和物体检测这样的研究领域具有像ImageNet、Microsoft COCO和KITTI这样的基准数据集。为了填补这一差距，促进微观交通流建模的发展，我们建立了一个公共基准数据集，用于汽车跟随行为建模。该基准测试由从五个公共驾驶数据集中提取的逾80K个汽车跟随事件组成，使用相同的标准。这些事件涵盖了各种情况，包括道路类型、道路宽度和交通流密度的变化以及两辆车之间的相对速度。",
