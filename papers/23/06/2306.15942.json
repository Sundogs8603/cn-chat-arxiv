    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于深度学习的波束形成算法在目标语音提取任务中展示出了良好的性能。然而，大多数系统并没有充分利用空间信息。本文提出了一种利用空间信息来增强神经波束形成器性能的目标语音提取网络。为了实现这一目标，我们首先使用UNet-TCN结构来建模输入特征，并通过避免其他模型中的直接降维造成的信息损失来提高语音预分离模块的估计准确性。此外，我们引入了一种多头交叉注意力机制，通过充分利用阵列接收到的空间信息，增强了神经波束形成器对空间信息的感知能力。实验结果表明，我们的方法将更合理的目标掩码估计网络和基于空间信息的交叉注意力机制引入神经波束形成器中，有效地改善了目标语音提取的性能。",
