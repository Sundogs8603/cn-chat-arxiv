    "translated_abstract": "深度学习广泛应用于无线通信问题中，包括信道估计。尽管存在许多数据驱动方法，但由于实验条件不一致和缺乏标准化的实验设计，对它们进行公正和现实的比较是困难的。此外，数据驱动方法的性能通常基于经验分析进行比较。缺乏可重复性和标准化评估工具（例如数据集、代码库）阻碍了数据驱动方法在信道估计和无线通信等领域的发展和进步。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一个建立基准测试的倡议，统一了几种数据驱动的OFDM信道估计方法。具体而言，我们提出了CeBed（信道估计测试平台），包括涵盖各种系统模型和传播条件的不同数据集，以及十个深度和传统的基线实现。本文旨在为评估和比较不同的数据驱动OFDM信道估计方法提供标准化的基准，解决领域内实验条件不一致和缺乏可重复性的问题。",
