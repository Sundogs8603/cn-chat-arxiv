    "translated_abstract": "临床领域非英语文本中的命名实体识别（NER）等自然语言任务可能非常耗时和昂贵，因为缺乏标注数据。跨语言迁移（CLT）是一种绕过这个问题的方法，多语言大型语言模型可以在一个语言上对特定任务进行微调，并在另一个语言上提供高精度。然而，还有其他利用翻译模型的方法可以在目标语言中执行NER，而无需标注数据，可以通过翻译训练集或测试集。本文比较了跨语言迁移与这两种替代方法，以在法语和德语中执行临床NER，而不需要这些语言的任何训练数据。为此，我们发布了MedNERF，这是从法国药物处方中提取的医学NER测试集，并使用与英语数据集相同的指南进行了注释。通过对这个数据集和一个德语医学语料库的广泛实验，我们表明，跨语言迁移比两种翻译方法在两种目标语言中都具有更好的性能。",
