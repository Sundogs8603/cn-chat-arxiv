    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了晶体材料的性质预测。晶体结构由一个最小的单元格组成，在三维空间中无限重复。如何在机器学习模型中准确表示这种重复结构仍然没有解决。当前的方法只在附近的节点之间建立边缘来构建图形，因此无法忠实地捕捉无限重复的模式和远距离的原子间相互作用。在这项工作中，我们提出了几个创新来克服这些限制。首先，我们建议直接建模物理原理的相互作用势，而不仅仅使用距离，如许多现有方法所做的。这些势包括库仑势，伦敦分散势和Pauli斥力势。其次，我们建模所有原子之间的完整势，而不仅仅是现有方法中的附近原子之间的势。这得益于我们用可证明的误差界逼近无限势和的方法。我们进一步开发了...",
