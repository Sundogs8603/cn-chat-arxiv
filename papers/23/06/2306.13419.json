    "translated_abstract": "随着可再生能源资源的间歇性发电的增加，日内电力市场在平衡能源供需方面起着越来越重要的作用，这就需要准确的概率价格预测。然而，迄今为止的研究都集中在单变量方法上，而在许多欧洲日内电力市场中，所有交割期都同时交易。因此，不同交易产品之间的依赖结构和相应的交叉产品影响是不能忽视的。本文采用copulas模型来建模高维日内价格回报向量的相关结构。我们将边际分布建模为零膨胀Johnson的S_U分布，其位置、尺度和形状参数取决于市场和基本数据。采用潜在贝塔回归来建模依赖结构，以解决日内电力市场的特定市场结构问题，例如不同交割期的交易会有重叠但独立的交易会话。我们的结果表明，与文献中常用的单变量方法相比，我们基于多元copula的方法可以显著提高日内价格预测精度。",
