In this study, we introduce X-DeepONet, a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), for learning moving-solution operators of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), with application to real-time earthquake localization. Leveraging the power of neural operators, X-DeepONet learns to estimate traveltime fields associated with earthquake sources by incorporating information from seismic arrival times and velocity models. Similar to the DeepONet, X-DeepONet includes a trunk net and a branch net. Additionally, we introduce a root network that not only takes the standard DeepONet's multiplication operator as input, it also takes addition and subtraction operators. We show that for problems with moving fields, the standard multiplication operation of DeepONet is insufficient to capture field relocation, while",

    "translated_abstract": "由人类活动引起的地震活动对公共安全构成了重大威胁，强调了准确和及时的地震震源定位的必要性。本研究介绍了X-DeepONet，这是一种新型的深度算子网络 (DeepONets) 变体，用于学习带参数的偏微分方程 (PDEs) 的移动解算器，并应用于实时地震定位。利用神经算子的力量，X-DeepONet 学习估计与地震源相关的走时场，通过将地震到时和速度模型的信息结合起来。类似于 DeepONet，X-DeepONet 包括主干网络和分支网络。此外，我们引入了一个根网络，它不仅将标准的 DeepONet 乘法算子作为输入，还将加法和减法算子作为输入。我们表明，在具有移动场的问题中，DeepONet 的标准乘法操作无法捕获场的重定位，而X-DeepONet 的根网络可以很好地解决这个问题。",
