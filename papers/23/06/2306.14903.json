    "translated_abstract": "社交网络在传播人们的观点、情绪、思维和恐惧方面起着重要作用。值得注意的是，在COVID-19大流行期间的封锁期后，抑郁症问题引起了人们的越来越多的关注，许多人借助社交网络表达情绪。利用深度学习技术从社交网络消息中辨别潜在的抑郁症迹象有助于早期识别心理健康状况。目前，通过社交网络检测抑郁症的努力通常仅依靠对文本内容进行分析，忽略了其他潜在信息。在这项工作中，我们进行了彻底的研究，揭示了抑郁症和负面情绪状态之间的强相关性。将这样的关联作为外部知识的整合可以为检测抑郁症提供宝贵的洞见。因此，我们提出了一种多任务训练框架DeSK，利用情感知识共享来实现。",
