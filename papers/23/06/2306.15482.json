    "translated_abstract": "尽管取得了令人难以置信的进展，深度学习已被证明容易受到对抗性攻击的影响。已经提出了许多方法来以经验和可证明的方式训练鲁棒网络。但是，大多数方法只能防御一种类型的攻击，而最近的研究在防御多种攻击方面有所进展。本文将多目标鲁棒性问题视为一个博弈过程，在这个过程中，不同的玩家（对手）通过协商在参数更新的方向上达成一致。我们发现了一个被称为玩家主导的现象，在这个博弈中，现有的最大值为基础的方法，如MAX和MSD，无法收敛。基于我们的理论分析，我们设计了一个新的框架，通过调整不同对手的预算来避免任何玩家的主导。在标准基准测试上的实验证明，将提出的框架应用于现有方法显著提高了多目标鲁棒性。",
