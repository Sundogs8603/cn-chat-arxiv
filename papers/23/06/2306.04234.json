    "translated_abstract": "随着在线教育系统的发展，个性化教育推荐发挥了重要作用。本文致力于开发路径推荐系统，旨在为每个用户在每个会话中生成和推荐整个学习路径。我们注意到现有方法未能考虑路径中概念的相关性，因此提出了一种新颖的框架，名为基于集合到序列排序的概念感知学习路径推荐（SRC），该框架将推荐任务在集合到序列的范式下进行。具体而言，我们首先设计了一个概念感知编码器模块，可以捕获输入学习概念之间的相关性。然后，将输出馈送到解码器模块中，通过一个处理学习和目标概念之间相关性的注意机制，按顺序生成路径。我们的推荐策略通过策略梯度进行优化。此外，我们还引入了一种基于图卷积网络的辅助模块，以进一步增强学习路径的表示。在两个真实数据集上进行的大量实验证明了我们提出的SRC框架与最先进方法相比的有效性。",

The decoder module generates the entire learning path by sequentially considering the attention mechanism between the learning and target concepts. An auxiliary module based on graph convolutional network is also introduced to enhance the representation of the learning path. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SRC in comparison with state-of-the-art methods."
