    "abstract": "The spread of the Sars-COV-2 pandemic in 2020 had a huge impact on the life course of all of us. This rapid spread has also caused an increase in the research production in topics related to COVID-19 with regard to different aspects. Italy has, unfortunately, been one of the first countries to be massively involved in the outbreak of the disease. In this paper we present an extensive scientometric analysis of the research production both at global (entire literature produced in the first 2 years after the beginning of the pandemic) and local level (COVID-19 literature produced by authors with an Italian affiliation). Our results showed that US and China are the most active countries in terms of number of publications and that the number of collaborations between institutions varies according to geographical distance. Moreover, we identified the medical-biological as the fields with the greatest growth in terms of literature production. Furthermore, we also better explored the relations",

    "translated_abstract": "2020年Sars-COV-2大流行的蔓延对我们所有人的生活轨迹产生了巨大影响。这种快速传播也导致涉及COVID-19的不同方面主题的研究产量增加。不幸的是，意大利是最早大规模卷入该病暴发的国家之一。在本文中，我们提出了一种广泛科学计量分析研究产量的方法，包括全球范围（疫情开始后的前两年内产生的全部文献）和本地层面（意大利附属机构作者撰写的COVID-19文献）。我们的结果表明，美国和中国是发表数量最多的研究活跃国家，并且机构之间合作的数量根据地理距离而异。此外，我们确定了医学生物学领域在文献产出方面增长最快。此外，我们还进一步探讨了出版物数量与死亡人数之间的关系。",
    "tldr": "本文通过科学计量分析COVID-19相关研究在全球和意大利的产量，发现美国和中国的研究活动最为活跃，在医学生物学领域的文献产出增长最快，并探讨了出版物数量和死亡人数之间的关系。",
    "en_tdlr": "This article presents a scientometric analysis of the global and local research production related to COVID-19, identifying the US and China as the most active countries in terms of publication output and the medical-biological field as the fastest-growing area of literature production. The study also explores the relationship between the number of publications and the number of deaths."
