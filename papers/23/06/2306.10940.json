It is important to forecast wildfires weeks and months in advance to plan forest fuel management, resource procurement and allocation. To achieve such accurate long-term forecasts at a global scale, it is crucial to employ models that account for the Earth system's inherent spatio-temporal interactions, such as memory effects and teleconnections. We propose a teleconnection-driven vision transformer (TeleViT), capable of treating the Earth as one interconnected system, integrating fine-grained local-scale inputs with global-scale inputs, such as climate indices and coarse-grained global variables. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate the superiority of TeleViT in accurately predicting global burned area patterns for various forecasting windows, up to four months in advance. The gain is especially pronounced in larger forecasting wind",

    "translated_abstract": "由于气候变化的加剧，野火问题日益恶化，需要采取先进的主动措施进行有效的缓解。提前几周甚至几个月预测野火对于计划森林燃料管理、资源采购和配置至关重要。为了在全球范围内实现准确的长期预测，必须采用能够考虑地球系统固有的时空相互作用，如记忆效应和电联的模型。我们提出了一种电联驱动的视觉Transformer（TeleViT），能够将地球视为一个相互连接的系统，将精细的局部尺度输入与全球尺度输入（如气候指数和粗粒度的全球变量）集成在一起。通过全面的实验证明，TeleViT在准确预测各种预测窗口下的全球烧毁面积模式方面具有优势，可以提前四个月进行预测。",
