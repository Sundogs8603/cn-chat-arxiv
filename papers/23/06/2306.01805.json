In this study, we explore the use of generative AI methods to extend current food computation models, primarily involving the analysis of nutrition and ingredients, to also incorporate cooking actions (e.g., add salt, fry the meat, boil the vegetables, etc.).

    "translated_abstract": "随着人们越来越关注自己的饮食选择，食品计算模型在帮助人们保持健康饮食习惯方面变得越来越流行。例如，食品推荐系统分析食谱指令以评估营养成分并提供食谱推荐。而生成AI方法（如自回归大语言模型）的成功应用可以让我们更全面地理解食谱，从而实现更为健康全面的食谱推荐。本研究探讨使用生成AI方法来扩展当前的食品计算模型，从而将烹饪行为（例如加盐、煎肉、煮蔬菜等）纳入考虑。烹饪行为由于其不规则的数据模式而难以使用统计学习方法进行建模。",
