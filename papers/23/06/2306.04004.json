Given a graph laplacian matrix, the technique generates unbiased approximations of its Schur complements and treats the corresponding graphs as augmented views. We discuss the benefits of our approach, provide theoretical justifications and present connections with graph diffusion. Unlike previous efforts, we study the empirical effectiveness of the augmentor in a controlled fashion by varying the design choices for subsequent GCL phases, such as encoding and contrasting. Extensive experiments on node and graph classification benchmarks demonstrate that our technique consistently outperforms pre-defined and adaptive augmentation approaches to achieve state-of-the-art results.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种基于舒尔补的随机拓扑增强器，用于图形对比学习（GCL）。给定图拉普拉斯矩阵，该技术生成其随机舒尔补的无偏估计，并将相应的图形视为增强视图。我们讨论了我们方法的优点，提供了理论说明，并展示了与图扩散的联系。与以往的努力不同，我们通过改变后续GCL阶段（如编码和对比）的设计选择来有计划地研究增强器的实证有效性。对节点和图分类基准的广泛实验表明，我们的技术始终优于预定义和自适应增强方法，以实现最先进的结果。",
