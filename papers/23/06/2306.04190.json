    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人们对应用自动语音识别（ASR）于阅读练习中的兴趣日益增长。在一项先前的研究中，我们介绍了一款基于ASR的荷兰语阅读辅导软件，旨在帮助正在学习阅读的小学一年级学生及时获得反馈。结果表明，ASR在阅读的初级阶段有潜力帮助学生提高阅读准确性和流畅度。在本研究中，我们使用现有语料库（JASMIN）中的儿童语音开发了两个新的ASR系统，并将结果与先前的研究进行比较。我们使用 Cohen's Kappa、Matthews相关系数（MCC）、精确度、召回率和F-measures等评估方法，以单词为单位分析ASR系统的正确/错误分类，并与人工判断进行比较。我们发现新开发的ASR系统在与人类判断的一致性和正确的拒绝错误语音方面有所改进。结果表明，优化ASR系统提供给小学一年级学生的反馈可以提高他们的阅读进步。",
