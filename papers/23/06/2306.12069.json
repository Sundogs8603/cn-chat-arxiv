    "translated_abstract": "机器阅读理解面临逻辑推理方面的新挑战，旨在理解给定上下文中所涉及的隐含逻辑关系并对其进行推理。由于逻辑复杂性，逻辑关系存在于不同的粒度级别。然而，大多数现有的推理方法分别关注实体感知或话语为基础的信息，但忽略了可能具有相互影响的层次关系。本文提出了一个基于全局图网络（HGN）的方法，既处理话语层面又处理单词层面的上下文，作为逻辑推理的基础，以提供更细粒度的关系提取。具体而言，通过分层交互机制对节点级别和类型级别的关系进行建模，这些关系可以解释为推理过程中的桥梁，以改进MRC系统的解释能力。实验结果表明，我们提出的方法在逻辑推理QA数据集（ReClor和LogiQA）和自然语言推理数据集（RACE和SWAG）上优于现有的最先进方法。",
