    "translated_abstract": "因果发现算法近年来取得了快速进展并越来越多地依靠灵活的非参数方法来处理复杂数据。然而，由于大多数真实数据源中真正的因果关系仍不为人所知，因此这些算法需要充分的经验验证。这个问题进一步加剧了环绕合适高质量数据发布的隐私问题。为了解决这些挑战，我们收集了一组复杂数据集，包括制造过程中装配线的测量数据。借助于对物理学的深入研究，这个数据集能够提供地面的因果关系对照。我们使用这个装配线数据和相关的地面真实信息来构建一个系统，生成半合成造数据来支持基准因果发现方法。为了实现这个目标，我们采用了最先进的仿真技术来生成数据集，模仿原始装配线数据集的特征，保留了过程变量之间的因果关系和它们的非线性依赖关系。",
