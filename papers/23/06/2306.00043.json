    "abstract": "Most metaheuristic algorithms rely on a few searched solutions to guide later searches during the convergence process for a simple reason: the limited computing resource of a computer makes it impossible to retain all the searched solutions. This also reveals that each search of most metaheuristic algorithms is just like a ballpark guess. To help address this issue, we present a novel metaheuristic algorithm called space net optimization (SNO). It is equipped with a new mechanism called space net; thus, making it possible for a metaheuristic algorithm to use most information provided by all searched solutions to depict the landscape of the solution space. With the space net, a metaheuristic algorithm is kind of like having a ``vision'' on the solution space. Simulation results show that SNO outperforms all the other metaheuristic algorithms compared in this study for a set of well-known single objective bound constrained problems in most cases.",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数元启发式算法依赖于一些被搜索的解来引导后续搜索，以在收敛过程中使用，其原因很简单：计算机的有限计算资源使得无法保留所有已搜索的解。这也揭示出大多数元启发式算法的每一次搜索都像是一个近似的猜测。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的元启发式算法：空间网优化（SNO）。它配备了一种称为空间网的新机制，从而使元启发式算法能够使用所有搜索解提供的大部分信息来描述解空间的景观。通过空间网，元启发式算法就像在解空间上拥有了“视觉”。模拟结果显示，在该研究中与一组著名的单目标有约束问题相比，SNO在大多数情况下都优于其他所有比较的元启发式算法。",
