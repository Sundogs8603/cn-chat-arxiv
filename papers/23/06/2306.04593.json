    "translated_abstract": "建立一个稳健且可靠的视频检索系统，尤其是针对海洋环境，是一个具有挑战性的任务，因为需要处理大量的密集和重复数据、遮挡、模糊、低照明条件和抽象查询等多种因素。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了 MarineVRS，这是一个专门为海洋领域设计的新颖且灵活的视频检索系统。MarineVRS集成了最先进的视觉和语言对象表示方法，能够实现高效准确地搜索和分析大量的水下视频数据。此外，与传统的视频检索系统不同，后者只允许用户索引一系列图像或视频并使用自由格式的自然语言句子搜索，我们的检索系统还包括一个额外的解释模块，输出输入查询所涉及对象的分割掩模。该功能允许用户在检索的视频中准确识别和分离感兴趣的对象，从而提供可解释和可解释的结果。大量实验证明，MarineVRS相比现有方法具有更优异的性能，并为海洋视频数据检索提供了可靠和直观的搜索界面。",
