    "translated_abstract": "近年来，神经网络已经广泛应用于多个领域，其中包括许多安全关键系统。神经网络是通过在 TensorFlow 和 PyTorch 等框架中进行编程构建（和训练）的。开发人员可以应用丰富的预定义层手动编写神经网络或通过 AutoML 自动生成网络。由于必须满足使用这些层的非平凡约束条件，所以使用不同层来组合神经网络容易出现错误。在本文中，我们提出了一种自动修复错误神经网络的方法。挑战在于识别出对网络进行最小修改以使其变为有效的修改。修改一层可能会对随后的层产生级联效应，因此我们的方法必须递归地搜索以识别“全局”最小修改。我们的方法基于深度学习层的可执行语义，并专注于实践中常见的四种错误。我们对我们的方法进行了验证。",
