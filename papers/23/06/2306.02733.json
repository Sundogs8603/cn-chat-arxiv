    "translated_abstract": "自由能原理（FEP）描述生物代理通过相应环境的生成模型最小化变分自由能（FE）。主动推理（AIF）是FEP的推论，描述了代理人通过最小化期望的FE目标来探索和利用其环境。在两篇相关论文中，我们通过自由形式Forney-style因子图（FFG）上的消息传递，描述了一种可扩展的合成AIF代理的认知方法。本文（第二部分）根据变分演算法，导出了最小化CFFG上（广义）FE目标的消息传递算法。比较了模拟Bethe和广义FE代理之间的差异，说明了合成AIF如何在T形迷宫导航任务上引起认知行为。通过对合成AIF代理的完整消息传递描述，可以推导和重用该代理在不同环境下的行为。",
