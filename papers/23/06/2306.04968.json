    "translated_abstract": "当前基于聚类的开放式关系抽取(OpenRE)方法通常采用两阶段流程。第一阶段同时学习关系表示和分配。第二阶段手动标记一些实例，并为每个聚类命名关系。然而，无监督目标难以优化模型以获得准确的聚类分配，并且必须提前确定群集数量。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的设置，称为用于OpenRE的主动监督聚类。我们的见解在于聚类学习和关系标注可以交替进行，为聚类提供必要的指导，而不会显著增加人力资源。设置的关键在于选择要标记的实例。我们提出了一种新的策略，适用于动态发现未知关系的聚类。基准数据集上的实验结果显示，我们的方法在聚类准确性和关系提取性能方面优于现有方法。",
