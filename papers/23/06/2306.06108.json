    "translated_abstract": "区块链通过挖掘其开放且不可变的交易数据为金融取证提供了独特且可追溯的渠道。近期，使用加密货币交易数据训练机器学习模型进行异常检测，如洗钱和其他欺诈活动，已成为主流。本文提出了一种综合应用数据科学方法，用于比特币网络中的欺诈检测，并提供了两个独创性贡献。首先，本文提出了Elliptic++数据集，该数据集扩展了Elliptic交易数据集，包括822k个比特币钱包地址（节点），每个地址有56个特征和1.27M个时间交互作用。通过利用四种类型的图数据：（i）交易之间的图，代表比特币网络中的资金流动，（ii）地址之间的交互图，捕捉交易类型，从而实现了对欺诈交易和非法地址（参与者）的检测。",
