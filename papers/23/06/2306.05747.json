    "translated_abstract": "约束编程(CP)是一种声明式编程范例，可用于建模和解决组合优化问题，如作业车间调度问题(JSSP)。虽然CP求解器能够找到小实例的最优或近似最优解，但它们不适用于大实例，即需要长时间计算或产生低质量解。因此，实际调度应用经常采用快速手工制作的基于优先级的调度启发式方法以找到良好的初始解，并使用优化方法对其进行优化。本文提出了一种新颖的端到端方法，通过CP和强化学习(RL)来解决调度问题。与先前针对特定问题定制的RL方法不同，包括过程模拟算法、复杂的特征工程或手工制作的奖励函数，我们的神经网络架构和训练算法仅需要某些调度问题的通用CP编码、一小组问题特定约束条件和反映JSSP最优标准的奖励函数。对几个JSSP基准测试结果表明，我们的方法与最先进的RL和CP方法竞争，并且通常可以在很短时间内为大型实例产生最优或近似最优解。",
