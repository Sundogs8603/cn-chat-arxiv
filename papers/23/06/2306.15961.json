    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统经常遭受各种推荐偏见的困扰，严重阻碍了其发展。在这个背景下，已经提出了一系列消除推荐偏见的方法，尤其适用于两种最常见的偏见，即流行度偏见和放大的主观偏见。然而，现有的消除偏见方法通常只关注纠正单一偏见。这种单一功能性的消除偏见忽视了推荐物品多个偏见之间的耦合问题。此外，之前的工作无法解决稀疏数据带来的缺乏监督信号问题，而这在推荐系统中已经变得很普遍。在本研究中，我们引入了一种解缠的消除偏见变分自编码器框架（DB-VAE），来解决单一功能性问题，以及一种反事实数据增强方法，以减轻由于数据稀疏性带来的不利影响。具体而言，DB-VAE首先提取只受单个偏见影响的两种极端物品。",
