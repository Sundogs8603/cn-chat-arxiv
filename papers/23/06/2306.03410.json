    "translated_abstract": "我们提出使用仿真驱动的逆推理方法来模拟操纵下的树枝关节动力学。学习枝干动态并获得操纵可变形植被的能力可帮助处理容易遮挡的任务，例如在密集树叶中采摘水果、移动悬垂的藤蔓和树枝，以便在密集植被中导航。植物的可变形几何形状通过在并行、不可微模拟器上执行的粗略弹簧抽象来实现。由模拟器定义的隐式统计模型、通过主动探测的地面真实情况获得的参考轨迹和贝叶斯形式主义一起指导弹簧参数后验密度估计。我们的无参数推理算法基于斯坦变分梯度下降，并将生物学上的假设作为神经网络驱动的学习联合先验合并到推理过程中。此外，它利用了有限差分方案来对函数梯度进行估计，从而克服了传统参数推理方法中的梯度计算困难和维度灾难问题。",
