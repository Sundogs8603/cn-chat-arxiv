    "abstract": "We study the price rigidity of regular and sale prices, and how it is affected by pricing formats (pricing strategies). We use data from three large Canadian stores with different pricing formats (Every-Day-Low-Price, Hi-Lo, and Hybrid) that are located within a 1 km radius of each other. Our data contains both the actual transaction prices and actual regular prices as displayed on the store shelves. We combine these data with two generated regular price series (filtered prices and reference prices) and study their rigidity. Regular price rigidity varies with store formats because different format stores treat sale prices differently, and consequently define regular prices differently. Correspondingly, the meanings of price cuts and sale prices vary across store formats. To interpret the findings, we consider the store pricing format distribution across the US.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了正常价格和特价价格的价格刚性，以及它们如何受到定价格式（定价策略）的影响。我们使用了三个位于彼此1公里半径内的加拿大大型商店的数据，这些商店具有不同的定价格式（每日低价，高低价和混合）。我们的数据包含实际交易价格和在商店货架上显示的实际正常价格。我们将这些数据与两个生成的正常价格序列（过滤价格和参考价格）结合起来进行研究其刚性。由于不同的商店格式对待特价价格的方式不同，因此正常价格的刚性因商店格式而异，从而导致对正常价格的定义不同。相应地，价格下调和特价价格在不同的商店格式下的含义也不同。为了解释研究结果，我们考虑了美国各种商店定价格式的分布情况。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过对三家位于加拿大的不同定价格式商店的数据进行研究，发现不同的定价格式会影响正常价格的刚性，也会导致对价格下调和特价价格的定义有所不同。",

The findings suggest that different pricing formats impact the rigidity of regular prices and the definition of price cuts and sale prices."
