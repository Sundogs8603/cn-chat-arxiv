    "abstract": "We introduce an open-domain topic classification system that accepts user-defined taxonomy in real time. Users will be able to classify a text snippet with respect to any candidate labels they want, and get instant response from our web interface. To obtain such flexibility, we build the backend model in a zero-shot way. By training on a new dataset constructed from Wikipedia, our label-aware text classifier can effectively utilize implicit knowledge in the pretrained language model to handle labels it has never seen before. We evaluate our model across four datasets from various domains with different label sets. Experiments show that the model significantly improves over existing zero-shot baselines in open-domain scenarios, and performs competitively with weakly-supervised models trained on in-domain data.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一个实时接受用户定义分类法的开放领域主题分类系统。用户可以根据他们想要的候选标签对文本片段进行分类，并从我们的网络界面获得即时响应。为了获得这种灵活性，我们以零射击的方式构建了后端模型。通过在从维基百科构建的新数据集上进行训练，我们的标签感知文本分类器能够有效利用预训练语言模型中的隐含知识来处理它以前从未见过的标签。我们在来自不同领域的四个数据集上评估了我们的模型，这些数据集具有不同的标签集。实验结果表明，在开放领域场景下，该模型明显优于现有的零射击基线，并与在域内数据上进行弱监督训练的模型有竞争力。",
