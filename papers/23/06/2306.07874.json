    "translated_abstract": "领域自适应旨在缓解不同领域之间的分布偏移。然而，传统的方法大多限于分类领域，这严重简化了真实世界中微妙的领域关系。在本文中，我们通过分层结构领域进行推广，将领域形式化为具有嵌套的层次相似结构，例如动物物种和产品目录。我们建立在经典对抗框架之上，并引入了一种新颖的分类器，该分类器与对抗性鉴别器竞争以保留层次结构信息。当给定非信息领域分类（例如，所有叶节点都链接到根节点的扁平分类）时，平衡点恢复经典的对抗领域适应解决方案，同时在其他分类中产生非平凡的结果。在合成和实际数据集上实证结果表明，我们的方法实现了最先进的性能，并成功进行了自适应。代码可在https://gith获得。",
