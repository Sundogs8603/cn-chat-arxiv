    "abstract": "This study explores the concept of creativity and artificial intelligence (AI) and their recent integration. While AI has traditionally been perceived as incapable of generating new ideas or creating art, the development of more sophisticated AI models and the proliferation of human-computer interaction tools have opened up new possibilities for AI in artistic creation. This study investigates the various applications of AI in a creative context, differentiating between the type of art, language, and algorithms used. It also considers the philosophical implications of AI and creativity, questioning whether consciousness can be researched in machines and AI's potential interests and decision-making capabilities. Overall, we aim to stimulate a reflection on AI's use and ethical implications in creative contexts.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了创造力与人工智能（AI）的概念及其最近的整合。虽然传统上认为AI无法产生新思想或创造艺术，但更复杂的AI模型的开发和人机交互工具的普及为AI在艺术创作中带来了新的可能性。本研究调查了AI在创意背景下的各种应用，区分了所使用的艺术类型、语言和算法。它还考虑了AI和创造力的哲学意义，质疑意识是否可以在机器中研究，以及AI的潜在兴趣和决策能力。总体而言，我们旨在引发对AI在创意背景下使用和伦理影响的反思。",
