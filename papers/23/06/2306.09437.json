    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了算法学习竞标时不同支付规则对效率的影响。我们进行了一个完全随机实验，进行了427次试验，其中Q-learning的竞标者参加了高达250,000次关于共同评估项的竞拍。我们的研究发现，第一价格拍卖，即胜利者支付获胜出价，容易受到协调竞标压制，胜出出价平均低于真实价值约20%。相比之下，第二价格拍卖，即胜利者支付第二高出价，使获胜出价与实际价值一致，减少学习期间的波动并加快收敛速度。回归分析考虑了诸如支付规则、参与人数、折扣和学习率等算法因素、异步/同步更新、反馈和探索策略等设计因素，发现支付规则对效率至关重要。此外，机器学习估计器发现，支付规则甚至比其他因素更加重要。",
