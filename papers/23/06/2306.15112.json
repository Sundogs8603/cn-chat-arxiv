    "abstract": "Analyzing open-ended survey responses is a crucial yet challenging task for social scientists, non-profit organizations, and educational institutions, as they often face the trade-off between obtaining rich data and the burden of reading and coding textual responses. This demo introduces FeedbackMap, a web-based tool that uses natural language processing techniques to facilitate the analysis of open-ended survey responses. FeedbackMap lets researchers generate summaries at multiple levels, identify interesting response examples, and visualize the response space through embeddings. We discuss the importance of examining survey results from multiple perspectives and the potential biases introduced by summarization methods, emphasizing the need for critical evaluation of the representation and omission of respondent voices.",

    "translated_abstract": "分析开放性调查回答是社会科学家、非营利组织和教育机构面临的关键但具有挑战性的任务，因为他们常常面临着获取丰富数据和阅读和编码文本回答的负担之间的权衡。本文介绍了FeedbackMap，这是一个基于网络的工具，利用自然语言处理技术来促进开放性调查回答的分析。FeedbackMap让研究人员可以在多个层次上生成摘要，识别有趣的回答示例，并通过嵌入方式可视化回答空间。我们讨论了从多个角度审视调查结果的重要性以及总结方法引入的潜在偏见，强调了对被调查人声音的代表性和遗漏性的批判性评估的必要性。",
