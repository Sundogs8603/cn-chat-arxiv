    "translated_abstract": "在自然界中，基因通过数十亿年的传递和积累，赋予地球上生物的当前生物智能。受到生物智能的启发，人工智能（AI）致力于构建机器智能。尽管取得了繁荣的成功，但机器智能仍远远落后于生物智能。原因可能在于动物天生具有某种基因编码的智能，而机器缺乏此类智能，需要从头学习。受到动物基因的启发，我们定义了机器的“基因”，称为“学习基因”，并提出了遗传增强学习（GRL）。GRL是一个计算框架，模拟了强化学习（RL）中有机体的进化，并利用学习基因来学习和演化智能体。利用GRL，我们首先证明了学习基因采用了智能体神经网络的片段形式，并且可以继承。这通过实验验证了GRL在智能体训练中的有效性。",
