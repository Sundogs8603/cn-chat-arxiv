    "abstract": "Rigorous and interactive class discussions that support students to engage in high-level thinking and reasoning are essential to learning and are a central component of most teaching interventions. However, formally assessing discussion quality 'at scale' is expensive and infeasible for most researchers. In this work, we experimented with various modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically generate rubric scores for individual dimensions of classroom text discussion quality. Specifically, we worked on a dataset of 90 classroom discussion transcripts consisting of over 18000 turns annotated with fine-grained Analyzing Teaching Moves (ATM) codes and focused on four Instructional Quality Assessment (IQA) rubrics. Despite the limited amount of data, our work shows encouraging results in some of the rubrics while suggesting that there is room for improvement in the others. We also found that certain NLP approaches work better for certain rubrics.",

    "translated_abstract": "严格而互动的课堂讨论对于学习至关重要，同时也是大多数教学干预的核心组成部分。然而，对讨论质量进行规模化的正式评估对于大多数研究者来说是昂贵且不可行的。在这项工作中，我们尝试了各种现代自然语言处理（NLP）技术，以自动生成课堂文本讨论质量的细化标准得分。具体而言，我们使用了包含超过18000轮次、注释有详细的教学分析运动（ATM）代码的90个课堂讨论记录数据集，并聚焦于四个教学质量评估（IQA）标准。尽管数据量有限，我们的工作在一些标准上取得了令人鼓舞的结果，同时也暗示其他标准仍有改进空间。我们还发现，某些NLP方法在某些标准上效果更好。",
