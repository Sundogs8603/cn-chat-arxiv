    "translated_abstract": "随着Open Radio Access Network（O-RAN）和5G等新兴网络的不断发展，对具有不同需求的各种服务的需求也在增加。网络切片已经成为解决不同服务需求的潜在方案。然而，在动态环境下管理网络切片并保持服务质量（QoS）是一项具有挑战性的任务。利用机器学习（ML）方法进行动态网络的最优控制，可以通过防止服务级别协议（SLA）违规，提高网络性能，这对于可靠的决策和满足新兴网络的需求非常重要。虽然基于RL的控制方法可以有效地实现网络QoS的实时监控和控制，但需要泛化来提高决策的可靠性。本文介绍了一种创新的基于注意力的深度强化学习（ADRL）技术，利用O-RAN分离模块和分布式代理合作来实现更好的切片管理。",
