    "abstract": "Public transit is a popular mode of transit due to its affordability, despite the inconveniences due to the necessity of transfers required to reach most areas. For example, in the bus and metro network of New Delhi, only 30\\% of stops can be directly accessed from any starting point, thus requiring transfers for most commutes. Additionally, last-mile services like rickshaws, tuk-tuks or shuttles are commonly used as feeders to the nearest public transit access points, which further adds to the complexity and inefficiency of a journey. Ultimately, users often face a tradeoff between coverage and transfers to reach their destination, regardless of the mode of transit or the use of last-mile services. To address the problem of limited accessibility and inefficiency due to transfers in public transit systems, we propose ``opti-mile,\" a novel trip planning approach that combines last-mile services with public transit such that no transfers are required.
