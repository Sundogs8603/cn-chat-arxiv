    "translated_abstract": "结构因果模型(SCM)被广泛应用于各个领域，以表示复杂系统中变量之间的因果关系。然而，真正的底层有向无环图(DAG)结构通常是未知的，并且从观测数据或干预数据中确定它仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务。然而，在许多情况下，目标是识别相关SCM之间的因果机制的变化(转变)而不是恢复整个底层DAG结构。例子包括分析健康和癌症患者之间的基因调控网络结构变化，或者在不同细胞环境下理解生物途径的变化。本文重点研究了在相同的变量集上识别两个或多个相关SCM中的$\\textit{功能}$机制转变，而不需要估计每个SCM的整个DAG结构。在这种设置下，先前的工作假设使用了具有高斯噪声的线性模型；而本文中我们则考虑了非线性加性噪声模型。",
