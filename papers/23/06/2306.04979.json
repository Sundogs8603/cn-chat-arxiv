    "translated_abstract": "虽然图神经网络在图分类中取得了显著成果，但它们通常需要大量特定任务的标签，这可能需要极大的代价来获得。一种可靠的解决方案是探索其他标注图以增强目标域的无监督学习，但如何将图神经网络应用到领域适应中仍未解决，因为对图拓扑的不充分探索以及相当大的领域偏差。本文提出了一种称为CoCo（Coupled Contrastive Graph Representation Learning）方案，该方案从耦合学习分支中提取拓扑信息，并通过耦合对比学习减少领域差异。CoCo包含一个图卷积网络分支和分层图内核网络分支，分别用隐式和显式方式探索图拓扑。此外，我们将耦合分支结合到一个全面的多视角对比学习框架中，",
