    "translated_abstract": "在高维状态空间模型中进行概率推断是具有挑战性的计算任务。然而，对于许多时空系统，我们可以获得有关状态变量依赖结构的先验知识。我们利用这种结构，提出了一种在具有（部分）未知动力学和有限历史数据的图结构状态空间模型中进行状态估计和学习的计算有效方法。借鉴深度学习与高斯马尔可夫随机场（GMRF）中的有原则的推断的最近方法，我们将图结构状态空间模型重新定义为由简单的空间和时间图层定义的深度GMRF。这产生了一个灵活的时空先验，可以通过变分推断从单个时间序列上高效地学习。在线性高斯假设下，我们保留了一个封闭形式的后验，可以使用共轭梯度法高效地采样，与经典的卡尔曼方法相比，具有可扩展性的优势。",
