    "abstract": "Recommendation system serves as a conduit connecting users to an incredibly large, diverse and ever growing collection of contents. In practice, missing information on fresh (and tail) contents needs to be filled in order for them to be exposed and discovered by their audience. We here share our success stories in building a dedicated fresh content recommendation stack on a large commercial platform. To nominate fresh contents, we built a multi-funnel nomination system that combines (i) a two-tower model with strong generalization power for coverage, and (ii) a sequence model with near real-time update on user feedback for relevance. The multi-funnel setup effectively balances between coverage and relevance. An in-depth study uncovers the relationship between user activity level and their proximity toward fresh contents, which further motivates a contextual multi-funnel setup. Nominated fresh candidates are then scored and ranked by systems considering prediction uncertainty to further",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统作为将用户与庞大、多样和不断增长的内容集合进行连接的中介。实际上，需要填补关于新鲜（和尾部）内容的信息缺失，以便让观众得以发现和利用它们。本文分享了我们在一个大型商业平台上构建专用的新鲜内容推荐系统的成功经验。为了提名新鲜内容，我们构建了一个多入口提名系统，它结合了（i）具有广泛泛化能力的两塔模型和（ii）具有接近实时的用户反馈更新的序列模型，以保持覆盖和相关性之间的有效平衡。深入的研究揭示了用户活动水平与其接近新鲜内容的关系，这进一步激发了一个上下文多入口的设置。提名的新鲜候选者然后由系统得分和排名，考虑预测的不确定性，以避免暴露平庸的内容。这个提名和排名系统极大地提高了新鲜内容的整体质量和易于与现有的推荐系统集成。",
