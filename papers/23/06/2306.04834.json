    "translated_abstract": "在自主水下机器人（AUV）采集的水下图像中检测人造物体是许多海底应用的关键要求。实际世界中的AUV图像数据集往往非常大且未标记。此外，这些数据集通常不平衡，包含很少的感兴趣对象的实例，特别是在搜索场景中的异常对象时。因此，难以拟合能够可靠检测这些对象的模型。考虑到这些因素，我们建议将人造物体视为异常值，并通过基于变分自编码器（VAE）的半监督框架来检测它们。我们开发了一种方法，将图像数据聚类到一个学习到的低维潜在空间中，并提取可能包含异常特征的图像。我们还设计了一种基于提取图像的重建质量差的区域的异常得分。我们证明，通过在大型图像数据集上应用这两种方法，可以向人类操作员显示候选物体，从而大大提高水下目标检测的效率。",

An anomaly score based on the reconstruction quality of image regions is also introduced. The proposed approach can greatly improve the efficiency of underwater target detection for human operators."
