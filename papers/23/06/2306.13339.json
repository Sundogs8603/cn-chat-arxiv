    "translated_abstract": "信任评估评估实体之间的信任关系并促进决策。机器学习由于其学习能力而表现出巨大的潜力，因此对信任评估具有重要意义。近年来，作为一种新的机器学习范 paradigm，图神经网络（GNN）在处理图形数据方面表现出优越性。这激发了研究人员探索将其用于信任评估，因为实体之间的信任关系可以建模为图形。但是，使用GNN的当前信任评估方法未能完全满足信任的动态性，忽略了攻击对信任评估的不利影响，并且无法提供令人信服的评估结果解释。为解决这些问题，在本文中，我们提出了TrustGuard ：一种支持信任动态性、抗击鲁棒且通过可视化提供解释的精确信任评估模型。具体而言，TrustGuard 设计了一个由动态感知节点嵌入层、图卷积层、注意机制层和信任预测层组成的分层架构。为了评估提出的模型的有效性，我们对真实数据集进行了实验，并将TrustGuard与其他最先进的方法进行了比较。实验结果表明，TrustGuard 在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面均优于其他方法。",
