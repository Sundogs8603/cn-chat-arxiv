    "abstract": "Clickbait is the practice of engineering titles to incentivize readers to click through to articles. Such titles with sensationalized language reveal as little information as possible. Occasionally, clickbait will be intentionally misleading, so natural language processing (NLP) can scan the article and answer the question posed by the clickbait title, or spoil it. We tackle two tasks: classifying the clickbait into one of 3 types (Task 1), and spoiling the clickbait (Task 2). For Task 1, we propose two binary classifiers to determine the final spoiler type. For Task 2, we experiment with two approaches: using a question-answering model to identify the span of text of the spoiler, and using a large language model (LLM) to generate the spoiler. Because the spoiler is contained in the article, we frame the second task as a question-answering approach for identifying the starting and ending positions of the spoiler. We created models for Task 1 that were better than the baselines proposed",

    "translated_abstract": "点击诱饵是一种通过精心设计标题来激励读者点击文章的做法。这些使用夸张语言的标题尽可能少地透露信息。有时，点击诱饵会故意误导读者，因此自然语言处理（NLP）可以扫描文章并回答点击诱饵标题提出的问题，或者剧透信息。我们解决了两个任务：将点击诱饵分类为3种类型之一（任务1），以及剧透点击诱饵（任务2）。对于任务1，我们提出了两个二元分类器来确定最终的剧透类型。对于任务2，我们尝试了两种方法：使用问答模型来识别剧透文本的范围，以及使用大型语言模型（LLM）生成剧透信息。由于剧透信息包含在文章中，我们将第二个任务描述为一种用于识别剧透信息开始和结束位置的问答方法。我们创建的任务1模型优于提出的基准模型。",
