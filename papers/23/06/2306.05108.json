    "abstract": "Graphs are widely used to encapsulate a variety of data formats, but real-world networks often involve complex node relations beyond only being pairwise. While hypergraphs and hierarchical graphs have been developed and employed to account for the complex node relations, they cannot fully represent these complexities in practice. Additionally, though many Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed for representation learning on higher-order graphs, they are usually only evaluated on simple graph datasets. Therefore, there is a need for a unified modelling of higher-order graphs, and a collection of comprehensive datasets with an accessible evaluation framework to fully understand the performance of these algorithms on complex graphs. In this paper, we introduce the concept of hybrid graphs, a unified definition for higher-order graphs, and present the Hybrid Graph Benchmark (HGB). HGB contains 23 real-world hybrid graph datasets across various domains such as biology, social media",

    "translated_abstract": "图被广泛用于封装各种数据格式，但是现实世界中的网络通常涉及复杂的节点关系，不仅仅是成对的关系。虽然已经开发和使用了超图和分层图来解决复杂的节点关系，但它们在实践中无法完全表示这些复杂性。此外，尽管已经提出了许多用于更高阶图的表示学习的图神经网络（GNN），但它们通常只在简单的图数据集上进行评估。因此，需要一个统一的更高阶图建模方法，并且需要一组包含全面数据集的可访问的评估框架，以完全了解这些算法在复杂图上的性能。在本文中，我们引入了混合图的概念，这是一个更高阶图的统一定义，并提出了混合图贝奇马克（HGB）。HGB包含各个领域的23个真实混合图数据集（如生物学、社交媒体和交通），并为GNN在复杂图上提供了全面的评估框架。",
