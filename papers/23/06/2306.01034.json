    "abstract": "The cost of data annotation is a substantial impediment for multi-label image classification: in every image, every category must be labeled as present or absent. Single positive multi-label (SPML) learning is a cost-effective solution, where models are trained on a single positive label per image. Thus, SPML is a more challenging domain, since it requires dealing with missing labels. In this work, we propose a method to turn single positive data into fully-labeled data: Pseudo Multi-Labels. Basically, a teacher network is trained on single positive labels. Then, we treat the teacher model's predictions on the training data as ground-truth labels to train a student network on fully-labeled images. With this simple approach, we show that the performance achieved by the student model approaches that of a model trained on the actual fully-labeled images.",

    "translated_abstract": "数据注释成本是多标签图像分类的一个重要障碍：必须为每个图像中的每个类别标记存在或不存在。单正多标签（SPML）学习提供了一种经济有效的解决方案，其中模型是在每个图像上训练一个正样本标签。因此，SPML是一个更具挑战性的领域，因为它需要处理缺失的标签。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种方法，通过伪造多标签来将单正数据转化为完全标记的数据。基本上，我们训练了一个在单正标签上的教师网络。然后，我们将教师模型在训练数据上的预测作为地面实况标签，以在完全标记的图像上训练学生网络。通过这种简单的方法，我们展示了学生模型所达到的性能接近使用实际完全标记图像训练的模型。",
