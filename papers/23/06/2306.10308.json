    "translated_abstract": "合成数据被认为是在保护隐私的同时共享个人级别数据的最有前途的解决方案。基于影子建模的成员推断攻击(MIAs)已经成为评估合成数据隐私风险的标准方法。虽然非常有效，但是它们需要创建大量的数据集和训练模型来评估单个记录的风险。因此，目前通过在选定的少数记录上运行MIAs来评估数据集的隐私风险。我们这里提出了我们认为是目前为止第一个基于原则的合成数据发布易受攻击记录识别技术，利用记录与最近邻之间的距离。我们展示了我们的方法在数据集和生成器之间明显优于以前的特定方法。我们还展示了我们的方法对于MIA选择和特定参数选择具有鲁棒性。最后，我们展示了它能够准确地识别易受攻击的记录。",
