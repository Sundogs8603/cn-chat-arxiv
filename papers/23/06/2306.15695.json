    "abstract": "We study joint learning of network topology and a mixed opinion dynamics, in which agents may have different update rules. Such a model captures the diversity of real individual interactions. We propose a learning algorithm based on multi-armed bandit algorithms to address the problem. The goal of the algorithm is to find each agent's update rule from several candidate rules and to learn the underlying network. At each iteration, the algorithm assumes that each agent has one of the updated rules and then modifies network estimates to reduce validation error. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm improves initial estimates of the network and update rules, decreases prediction error, and performs better than other methods such as sparse linear regression and Gaussian process regression.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了网络拓扑和混合舆论动力学的联合学习，其中代理人可能具有不同的更新规则。这种模型捕捉了现实个体互动的多样性。我们提出了一种基于多臂赌博算法的学习算法来解决这个问题。算法的目标是从几个候选规则中找到每个代理人的更新规则，并学习底层网络。在每次迭代中，算法假设每个代理人都有一个更新的规则，然后修改网络估计以减少验证误差。数值实验表明，所提出的算法改进了网络和更新规则的初始估计，减少了预测误差，并且比其他方法（如稀疏线性回归和高斯过程回归）表现更好。",
