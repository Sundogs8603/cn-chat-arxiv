    "abstract": "While there has been significant progress in ASR, African-accented clinical ASR has been understudied due to a lack of training datasets. Building robust ASR systems in this domain requires large amounts of annotated or labeled data, for a wide variety of linguistically and morphologically rich accents, which are expensive to create. Our study aims to address this problem by reducing annotation expenses through informative uncertainty-based data selection. We show that incorporating epistemic uncertainty into our adaptation rounds outperforms several baseline results, established using state-of-the-art (SOTA) ASR models, while reducing the required amount of labeled data, and hence reducing annotation costs. Our approach also improves out-of-distribution generalization for very low-resource accents, demonstrating the viability of our approach for building generalizable ASR models in the context of accented African clinical ASR, where training datasets are predominantly scarce.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管ASR取得了显著进展，但由于缺乏训练数据集，对于非洲口音的临床ASR的研究还不够。在这一领域构建强大的ASR系统需要大量的标注数据，用于各种语言和形态丰富的口音，但这些数据的创建成本较高。本研究旨在通过基于信息不确定性的数据选择来减少注释费用。我们表明，将认识不确定性纳入我们的自适应过程中，可以超过使用最先进（SOTA）ASR模型建立的几个基准结果，同时减少所需的标记数据量，从而降低注释成本。我们的方法还改善了低资源口音的超出分布泛化能力，展示了我们的方法在非洲临床ASR的背景下构建泛化型ASR模型的可行性，而在这种情况下，训练数据集主要是稀缺的。",
