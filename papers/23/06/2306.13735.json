    "translated_abstract": "在移动设备上使用监督学习进行人类活动识别 (HAR) 可以带来强大的分类性能。然而，这种方法需要大量已标注的数据，不仅用于模型的初始训练，还用于在特定客户端上对其进行定制（客户端的数据通常与训练数据有很大区别）。由于数据注释的成本、干扰性和耗时的本质，这实际上是不切实际的。此外，即使有大量已标注的数据的帮助，模型在异构客户端上的部署也面临着概括未见数据的困难。计算机视觉和自然语言处理等其他领域已经提出了预训练模型的概念，利用大规模语料库减少标注数据需求并更好地管理异构性。到目前为止，由于没有足够大的公共数据集，这种有前途的方法还没有在HAR领域中实现。在本文中，我们提供了组合公共数据集以减轻HAR标注数据稀缺问题的好处的实证评估。我们分析了数据集大小和多样性对预训练模型性能的影响，并表明，通过仔细选择和组合数据集，我们可以获得与使用更大的领域特定数据集相当的结果。我们的结果表明，预训练多样化的公共数据集是改善HAR模型概括性能的有前途的方法，同时减轻标注数据稀缺问题。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores how to combine public datasets to cope with labeled data scarcity in the field of Human Activity Recognition (HAR), and investigates the feasibility of using pre-trained models to improve HAR model generalization performance. The results suggest that using carefully selected and combined public datasets can achieve comparable results to using domain-specific datasets, providing a promising solution to labeled data scarcity."
