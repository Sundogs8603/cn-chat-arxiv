    "abstract": "In online platforms, the impact of a treatment on an observed outcome may change over time as 1) users learn about the intervention, and 2) the system personalization, such as individualized recommendations, change over time. We introduce a non-parametric causal model of user actions in a personalized system. We show that the Cookie-Cookie-Day (CCD) experiment, designed for the measurement of the user learning effect, is biased when there is personalization. We derive new experimental designs that intervene in the personalization system to generate the variation necessary to separately identify the causal effect mediated through user learning and personalization. Making parametric assumptions allows for the estimation of long-term causal effects based on medium-term experiments. In simulations, we show that our new designs successfully recover the dynamic causal effects of interest.",

    "translated_abstract": "在在线平台上，观察结果的治疗影响随着时间的推移可能会发生变化，原因是1）用户了解干预，2）系统个性化，例如个性化推荐，随着时间的推移而发生变化。我们介绍了个性化系统中用户行为的非参数因果模型。我们证明了Cookie-Cookie-Day（CCD）实验，在存在个性化时存在偏差，该实验旨在测量用户学习效应。我们提出了新的实验设计，干预个性化系统以产生必要的变化，以分别确定通过用户学习和个性化介导的因果效应。通过进行参数假设，可以基于中期实验估计长期因果效应。在模拟中，我们展示了我们的新设计成功地恢复了感兴趣的动态因果效应。",
