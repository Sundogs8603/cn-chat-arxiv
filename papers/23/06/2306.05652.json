    "abstract": "Social media platforms have enabled individuals suffering from mental illnesses to share their lived experiences and find the online support necessary to cope. However, many users fail to receive genuine clinical support, thus exacerbating their symptoms. Screening users based on what they post online can aid providers in administering targeted healthcare and minimize false positives. Pre-trained Language Models (LMs) can assess users' social media data and classify them in terms of their mental health risk. We propose a Question-Answering (QA) approach to assess mental health risk using the Unified-QA model on two large mental health datasets. To protect user data, we extend Unified-QA by anonymizing the model training process using differential privacy. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of modeling risk assessment as a QA task, specifically for mental health use cases. Furthermore, the model's performance decreases by less than 1% with the inclusion of differential privacy. T",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体平台使患有精神疾病的人分享生活经历并找到在线支持以应对疾病。然而，许多用户未能获得真正的临床支持，从而加剧了他们的症状。基于用户在网上发布的内容进行筛选可以帮助提供者进行有针对性的医疗保健，并尽量减少虚假阳性。预训练的语言模型（LMs）可以评估用户的社交媒体数据，并将其分类为其心理健康风险。我们提出了一种使用统一问答（Unified-QA）模型的问答方法来评估心理健康风险，应用于两个大型心理健康数据集。为了保护用户数据，我们扩展了Unified-QA，并使用差分隐私对模型训练过程进行了匿名化处理。我们的结果表明，将风险评估建模为问答任务对于心理健康用例特别有效。此外，包含差分隐私后，模型性能下降不到1%。",
