    "translated_abstract": "受韩国就业许可制度 (EPS) 约束的移民劳工必须在考虑“移民带来的技能相关性贬值”和“移民成本”的同时，在宿主国的高工资与之间取得平衡。本研究建立了移民劳工及雇佣他们的公司的优化机制模型，并利用博弈论的“反向归纳”方法得到了模型的解，即达到“子博弈完美纳什均衡 (SPNE)”。通过分析 SPNE 状态下变量之间的动态关系，得出了以下样式化事实：[1]宿主国的技能相关性和工资差异呈正相关；[2]移民国的技能相关性和工资差异呈负相关。这两个样式化事实——[1、2]——分别被操作化为“宿主国技能相关性假说 (H1)”和“移民国技能相关性假说 (H2)”，并通过OLS线性回归分析进行了彻底的检验。",
    "tldr": "该研究建立了移民劳工及其雇主的优化机制模型，发现宿主国的技能相关性和工资差异呈正相关，移民国的技能相关性和工资差异呈负相关。这为探索移民劳动力市场提供了重要的参考。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study established an optimization mechanism model for migrant workers and their employers, and found that there is a positive correlation between skill-relevance and wage differential in the host country, and a negative correlation in the emigrating country. These findings provide important reference for exploring the labor market of migrant workers."
