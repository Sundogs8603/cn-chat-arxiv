    "translated_abstract": "基于实例区分的自监督学习算法有效地防止表示坍缩，并在表示学习中产生了有希望的结果。然而，在嵌入空间中吸引正向对（即相同实例的两个视图）并排斥所有其他实例（即负向对），无论它们的类别，可能导致丢弃重要的特征。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种方法来识别具有相似语义内容的图像，并将它们视为正向实例，命名为语义正向对集合（SPPS），从而在表示学习中减少了丢弃重要特征的风险。我们的方法可以与任何对比实例区分框架（如SimCLR或MOCO）一起使用。我们在三个数据集（ImageNet、STL-10和CIFAR-10）上进行实验证明了我们的方法的有效性。实验结果表明，我们的方法始终优于基线方法vanilla。",
