    "translated_abstract": "在论文提交同行审查前发布预印本会产生什么影响？由于没有进行随机对照试验，因此我们需要利用观察数据来回答这个问题。我们使用了ICLR会议（2018-2022）的数据，并应用因果推断方法来估计在审阅期前删除论文（早期arXiving）对论文被会议接受的影响。调整了18个混杂因素，如主题、作者和质量，我们可以得出因果效应的估计值。然而，由于质量是一种难以估计的构建，因此我们使用负面结果控制方法，将论文引用次数作为对照变量，以消除质量混杂效应。我们的结果表明，早期arXiving可能会对论文被接受的机会产生一定程度的影响。然而，当存在影响时，这种影响在作者引用次数和机构排名分组后并没有显著差异。这表明早期arXiving对ICLR会议接受论文的影响微乎其微。",
    "tldr": "本研究使用数据和因果推断方法，研究了早期ArXiving论文对其被ICLR会议接受的影响。结果显示，早期ArXiving可能会对论文被接受的机会产生影响，但这种影响微乎其微，并且不因作者引用次数和机构排名等因素有所不同。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study used data and causal inference methods to study the impact of early ArXiving on the acceptance of papers by the ICLR conference. The results show that early ArXiving may have a small effect on the chances of paper acceptance, but this effect is minimal and does not differ based on factors such as author citation count and institute rank."
