    "translated_abstract": "近年来，科学技术的快速发展促使对捕捉数据特征（如突变或明显对比度）的适当统计工具的需求。许多数据科学应用需要从具有不连续性或奇异性的时间相关对象序列中进行时空重建，如带有边缘的动态计算机断层影像（CT）图像。传统的基于高斯过程（GP）的方法可能无法提供令人满意的解决方案，因为它们往往提供过度平滑的先验候选。最近，通过随机系数的小波展开定义的贝索夫过程（BP）被提出作为这类贝叶斯逆问题的更合适的先验。BP在成像分析中表现出优于GP的性能，能够产生保留边缘特征的重建结果，但没有自动地纳入动态变化图像中的时间相关性。本文将BP推广到时空领域（STBP），通过在小波展开中替换随机系数，实现了时空相关性的建模。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过将贝索夫过程推广到时空领域，以更好地处理贝叶斯逆问题中的时空重建。通过替换随机系数，该方法能够保持边缘特征并模拟动态变化图像的时空相关性。",

The method maintains edge features and incorporates temporal correlation by replacing random coefficients in wavelet expansions."
