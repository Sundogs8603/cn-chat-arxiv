    "translated_abstract": "情感分析是发现金融文章、新闻和社交媒体洞察的重要工具，塑造我们对市场走向的理解。尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在金融自然语言处理（NLP）方面具有惊人的能力，但它们仍然难以准确解读数字值并抓住金融背景，从而限制了它们在预测金融情感方面的有效性。在本文中，我们介绍了一种简单而有效的指令调整方法来解决这些问题。通过将少量的监督式金融情感分析数据转化为指令数据，并用此方法对通用的LLM进行微调，我们在金融情感分析方面取得了显着的进展。在实验中，我们的方法优于最先进的监督式情感分析模型，以及广泛使用的LLMs，如ChatGPT和LLaMAs，特别是在数字理解和背景理解是关键因素的情况下。",
