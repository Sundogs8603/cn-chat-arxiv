    "translated_abstract": "作为信息过滤服务，推荐系统通过提供个性化建议和帮助人们做出决策极大地丰富了我们的日常生活，使它们在信息时代对人类社会至关重要和不可或缺。然而，随着人们对它们的依赖程度增加，最近的研究显示，由于其不公平性（例如工作推荐中的性别歧视），推荐系统对社会和个人可能拥有无意识的影响。为了开发可信赖的服务，设计公正感知的推荐系统以缓解这些偏见问题至关重要。本综述概述了现有的公正性推荐系统方法和实践。首先，我们介绍了不同推荐场景下的公正性概念，全面分类当前的进展并介绍了促进推荐系统不同阶段的公正性的典型方法。接下来，在介绍数据集和评估方法后，我们讨论了一些未来的研究方向。",
