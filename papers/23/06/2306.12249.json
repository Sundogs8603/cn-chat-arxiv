    "abstract": "Music similarity is an essential aspect of music retrieval, recommendation systems, and music analysis. Moreover, similarity is of vital interest for music experts, as it allows studying analogies and influences among composers and historical periods. Current approaches to musical similarity rely mainly on symbolic content, which can be expensive to produce and is not always readily available. Conversely, approaches using audio signals typically fail to provide any insight about the reasons behind the observed similarity. This research addresses the limitations of current approaches by focusing on the study of musical similarity using both symbolic and audio content. The aim of this research is to develop a fully explainable and interpretable system that can provide end-users with more control and understanding of music similarity and classification systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "音乐相似性是音乐检索、推荐系统和音乐分析的重要方面。而且，对于音乐专家来说，相似性可以研究作曲家和历史时期之间的类比和影响。目前，针对音乐相似性的方法主要依赖符号内容，这可能成本高昂且不总是易于获得。相比之下，使用音频信号的方法通常无法提供有关观察到的相似性背后原因的任何见解。本研究通过使用符号和音频内容来研究音乐相似性，解决了当前方法的局限性。本研究的目的是开发一个完全可解释和可解释的系统，可以为最终用户提供更多对音乐相似性和分类系统的控制和理解。",
