    "abstract": "Identifying the relationship between healthcare attributes, lifestyles, and personality is vital for understanding and improving physical and mental conditions. Machine learning approaches are promising for modeling their relationships and offering actionable suggestions. In this paper, we propose Virtual Human Generative Model (VHGM), a machine learning model for estimating attributes about healthcare, lifestyles, and personalities. VHGM is a deep generative model trained with masked modeling to learn the joint distribution of attributes conditioned on known ones. Using heterogeneous tabular datasets, VHGM learns more than 1,800 attributes efficiently. We numerically evaluate the performance of VHGM and its training techniques. As a proof-of-concept of VHGM, we present several applications demonstrating user scenarios, such as virtual measurements of healthcare attributes and hypothesis verifications of lifestyles.",
