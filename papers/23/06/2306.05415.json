    "translated_abstract": "本文深入探讨了利用归一化流进行因果推论的应用。具体来说，我们首先利用非线性ICA的最新结果，显示出在给定因果排序的情况下，因果模型可以从观测数据中鉴别出来，并且可以使用自回归归一化流进行恢复。其次，我们分析了用于捕捉潜在因果数据生成过程的不同设计和学习选择的因果归一化流。第三，我们描述了如何在因果归一化流中实现do-operator，从而回答干预和反事实问题。最后，在我们的实验中，我们通过综合对比研究验证了我们的设计和训练选择；将因果归一化流与其他逼近因果模型的方法进行比较；并通过实证研究证明因果归一化流可用于解决现实世界中存在混合离散连续数据和因果图部分知识的问题。本文的代码可以进行访问。",
