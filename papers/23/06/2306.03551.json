    "translated_abstract": "工业4.0正在利用数字技术和机器学习技术来连接和优化制造过程。这一概念的核心在于将原始数据转化为可靠的数据驱动决策的人类可理解的知识。卷积神经网络（CNN）在处理图像数据方面发挥了重要作用，但是它们的“黑盒子”本质使得它们的预测过程难以理解。在这个背景下，解释性人工智能（XAI）领域的最新进展提出了概念的提取和定位，即视觉线索如何介入CNN的预测过程。本文探讨了将概念提取（CE）方法应用于工业4.0场景的问题。为此，我们修改了最近开发的技术“使用本地聚合描述符提取概念”（ECLAD），并改进了其可扩展性。具体而言，我们提出了一种新的概念重要性计算程序，利用加权平均来将局部特征与整体图像联系起来，改善ECLAD的性能。",
