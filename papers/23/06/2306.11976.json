    "translated_abstract": "自然语言被期望成为大型语言模型时代各种人机交互的关键媒介。在生物化学领域，围绕分子（例如，属性预测、分子挖掘等）的一系列任务具有重要意义，但技术门槛很高。将自然语言中的分子表达与化学语言相结合，不仅可以大大提高任务的解释性、降低操作难度，而且还可以融合散布在互补材料中的化学知识，深入理解分子。基于这些优势，我们提出了交互式分子设计，这是一项采用自然语言描述和编辑目标分子的新任务。为更好地完成此任务，我们设计了ChatMol，一种知识丰富且多功能的生成预训练模型，通过注入实验性质信息，分子空间知识以及自然语言和分子之间的关联进行增强。 ChatMol可以为分子生成信息丰富的描述，更正给定的分子，甚至可以通过互动对话迭代地设计具有所需属性的分子。我们在几个分子任务上测试了ChatMol，并证明其优于传统方法。",
