    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种新颖的方法来探测引力波，该方法结合了：1）混合膨胀卷积神经网络，以准确地建模引力波信号的短时和长时序列信息；以及2）图神经网络，以捕捉引力波天文观测站之间的空间关联，以一致地描述和识别探测器网络中的信号存在。这些时空图神经网络AI模型经过测试，用于探测近圆非自旋和近圆自旋非进动的二进制黑洞合并产生的引力波信号。对于后一种情况，我们需要一个包含120万个模拟波形的数据集来密集采样这个信号流形。因此，我们通过在阿贡国家实验室龙头超级计算机Polaris上使用256个NVIDIA A100 GPU进行分布式训练，在1.7小时内实现了训练时间到解决方案的减小，并获得了最佳的分类性能。",
