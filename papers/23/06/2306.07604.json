    "translated_abstract": "泊松方程在许多物理系统的建模中发挥着重要的作用。在电静自洽低温等离子体（LTP）模拟中，泊松方程在每个模拟时间步骤中得到解决，这可能会导致整个模拟的计算成本相当大。本文描述了一种通用的机器学习泊松求解器的开发，特别是针对结构化笛卡尔网格上复杂2D反应堆几何形状的LTP模拟要求而设计的。这里，反应堆几何形状可以包括内部电极和常见LTP模拟中的介电材料。该方法利用混合CNN-transformer网络架构结合加权多项式损失函数。我们使用高度随机化的合成数据训练网络，以确保所学求解器对未见过的反应堆几何形状有普适性。结果表明，学习求解器能够产生定量和定性上准确的解决方案。",
