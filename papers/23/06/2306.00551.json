Generally, students struggle with utilizing textbooks on programming to the maximum, with a possible reason being that the example programs provided as illustration of concepts in these textbooks don't offer sufficient interactivity for students, and thereby not sufficiently motivating to explore or understand these programming examples better. In our work, we explore the idea of enhancing the navigability of intelligent textbooks with the use of ``counterfactual'' questions, to make students think critically about these programs and enhance possible program comprehension. Inspired from previous works on nudging students on counter factual thinking, we present the possibility to enhance digital textbooks with questions generated using GPT.",

    "translated_abstract": "数字教材已经成为日常学习任务的重要组成部分。在本文中，我们考虑将数字教材用于编程课程。通常，学生们难以最大限度地利用编程教材，可能的原因是这些教材中用于说明概念的示例代码对学生的互动性不足，因此不足以激发学生进一步探索或理解这些编程示例。在我们的工作中，我们探讨了利用“反事实”问题增强智能教材导航性的想法，使学生对这些程序进行批判性思考并提高可能的程序理解。受以前有关教育领域的反事实思考诱导工作的启发，我们展示了使用GPT生成问题增强数字教科书的可能性。",
