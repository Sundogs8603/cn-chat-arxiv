    "translated_abstract": "采样技术被广泛应用于设计实验、图像处理和图形学等领域。每个领域中的技术都是为了满足特定的限制而设计的，例如每个维度的范围的均匀覆盖或至少在一定距离内随机采样。当应用程序强加新的限制时，例如需要在非矩形域中进行采样或将新样本添加到现有样本集中，常见的解决方法是修改当前使用的算法，但通常效果不佳。作为替代方案，我们提出了智能采样的概念，该概念旨在通过创建新算法或修改其他领域的合适算法来根据我们的采样需求设计算法。令人惊讶的是，定性和定量比较表明，一些相对简单的算法可以轻松修改以满足机器学习的许多采样需求，包括代理建模、超参数优化和数据分析。",
