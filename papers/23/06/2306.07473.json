First, we train a denoising neural network that learns to map from a smooth distribution of noisy molecules to the distribution of real molecules. Then, we follow the neural empirical Bayes framework [Saremi and Hyvarinen, 2019] and generate molecules in two steps: (i) sample noisy density grids from a smooth distribution via underdamped Langevin Markov chain Monte Carlo, and (ii) recover the ``clean'' molecule by denoising the noisy grid with a single step. Our method, VoxMol, generates molecules in a fundamentally different way than the current state of the art (i.e., diffusion models applied to atom point clouds). It differs in terms of the data representation, the noise model, the network architecture and the generative modeling algorithm. VoxMol achieves comparable results to state of the art on unconditional 3D molecule generation while being simpler to train and faste",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的基于分数的方法，用于生成表示为规则网格上的原子密度的3D分子。首先，我们训练了一个去噪声的神经网络，学习从噪声分子的平滑分布到真实分子的分布的映射。然后，我们遵循神经经验贝叶斯框架 [Saremi和Hyvarinen，2019]，通过两个步骤生成分子：（i）通过欠阻尼Langevin马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗从平滑分布中采样带噪声的密度网格，（ii）通过单步去噪噪声格，还原“干净”的分子。我们的方法VoxMol是一种根本不同于当前现有技术（即应用于原子点云的扩散模型）的生成分子的方法。它在数据表示、噪声模型、网络架构和生成建模算法方面不同。VoxMol在无条件3D分子生成方面取得了与现有技术可比较的结果，同时训练简单且更快。",
