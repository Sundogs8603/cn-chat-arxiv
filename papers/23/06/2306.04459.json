    "translated_abstract": "作为人工智能的主要领域之一，自然语言处理 (NLP) 已经通过深度神经网络取得了显著的成功。大量的 NLP 任务已经以一种统一的方式得到解决，各种任务通过共享相同的范例相互关联。然而，神经网络是黑匣子，并且依赖于概率计算。犯错是不可避免的。因此，估计神经网络的可靠性和可信性（换句话说，不确定性）成为一个关键的研究方向，在降低模型风险和做出更好决策方面起着至关重要的作用。因此，在本次调查中，我们综合评述了自然语言处理领域中与不确定性相关的工作。基于数据和范例的特性，我们首先将自然语言不确定性的来源分为三种类型，包括输入、系统和输出。然后，我们系统地回顾了不确定性量化方法和关键应用。最后，",
