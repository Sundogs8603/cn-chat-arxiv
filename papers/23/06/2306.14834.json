    "translated_abstract": "高质量的推荐系统应通过与用户的有效和探索性互动提供创新和相关内容。然而，许多现有推荐系统中基于监督学习的神经网络仅利用已识别的用户兴趣，对于有效发现未知用户偏好存在不足。尽管神经上下文Bandit算法在通过神经网络实现在线探索方面取得了一些进展，但他们对计算的要求较高，限制了它在实际推荐系统中的广泛应用。在本研究中，我们提出了一种可扩展的样本效率高的神经上下文Bandit算法用于推荐系统。为此，我们设计了一种认知神经网络架构，Epistemic Neural Recommendation (ENR)，它能够在大规模上实现Thompson抽样。通过两个不同的真实任务的大规模实验，ENR显著提高了点击率和用户评分。",
