    "translated_abstract": "仇恨言论检测是一项具有挑战性的自然语言处理任务，需要捕捉语言和语境细微差别。预训练语言模型（PLMs）提供了丰富的文本语义表示，可以改进这个任务。然而，对于有效地组合PLMs的表示和利用它们的互补优势的方法还知之甚少。在这项工作中，我们揭示了几种PLMs组合技术的方式，并全面分析了它们的有效性。我们的研究结果表明，组合嵌入可以略微改善性能，但计算成本较高，组合方式对最终结果的影响较小。我们还在https://github.com/aflah02/The-Art-of-Embedding-Fusion-Optimizing-Hate-Speech-Detection上公开了我们的代码库。",
