    "abstract": "Detecting duplicate patient participation in clinical trials is a major challenge because repeated patients can undermine the credibility and accuracy of the trial's findings and result in significant health and financial risks. Developing accurate automated speaker verification (ASV) models is crucial to verify the identity of enrolled individuals and remove duplicates, but the size and quality of data influence ASV performance. However, there has been limited investigation into the factors that can affect ASV capabilities in clinical environments. In this paper, we bridge the gap by conducting analysis of how participant demographic characteristics, audio quality criteria, and severity level of Alzheimer's disease (AD) impact the performance of ASV utilizing a dataset of speech recordings from 659 participants with varying levels of AD, obtained through multiple speech tasks. Our results indicate that ASV performance: 1) is slightly better on male speakers than on female speakers; 2)",

    "translated_abstract": "在临床试验中检测重复的患者参与是一个重大的挑战，因为重复的患者可能会破坏试验结果的可信度和准确性，导致重大的健康和财务风险。开发准确的自动化说话人验证（ASV）模型对于验证已注册个体的身份并去除重复项来说至关重要，但是数据的大小和质量会影响ASV的表现。然而，迄今为止对于影响临床环境中ASV能力的因素的调查有限。在本文中，我们通过对从多个说话任务中获取的659个具有不同AD感染程度的参与者的语音记录数据集进行分析，探讨参与者的人口统计特征、音频质量标准和AD的严重程度对ASV性能的影响。我们的结果表明，ASV的性能：1）在男性说话者上略优于女性说话者；2）",
