    "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between narratives conveyed through microblogging platforms, namely Twitter, and the value of crypto assets. Our study provides a unique technique to build narratives about cryptocurrency by combining topic modelling of short texts with sentiment analysis. First, we used an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to discover the latent topics within the massive and noisy textual data from Twitter, and then we revealed 4-5 cryptocurrency-related narratives, including financial investment, technological advancement related to crypto, financial and political regulations, crypto assets, and media coverage. In a number of situations, we noticed a strong link between our narratives and crypto prices. Our work connects the most recent innovation in economics, Narrative Economics, to a new area of study that combines topic modelling and sentiment analysis to relate consumer behaviour to narratives.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究调查了微博平台（Twitter）传递的叙述与加密资产价值之间的关系。我们的研究采用了一种独特的技术，将短文本的主题建模与情感分析相结合，建立了关于加密货币的叙述。首先，我们使用了一种无监督的机器学习算法，从Twitter的大规模和嘈杂文本数据中发现潜在主题，然后我们揭示了4-5个与加密货币相关的叙述，包括与加密货币相关的金融投资、技术进步、金融和政治监管、加密资产和媒体报道。在许多情况下，我们注意到我们的叙述与加密货币价格之间存在强大的联系。我们的工作将最新的经济学创新——叙事经济学与主题建模和情感分析相结合的新领域联系起来，以关联消费者行为和叙述。",
