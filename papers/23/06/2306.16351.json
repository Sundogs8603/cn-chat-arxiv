    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了在基本风险四边形（Fundamental Risk Quadrangle，简称FRQ）理论框架下的“期望风险度量”概念。根据FRQ理论，一个四边形由与随机变量相关的四个随机函数组成：“误差”、“遗憾”、“风险”和“偏差”。这些函数通过一种随机函数（称为“统计量”）相互关联。期望值作为一种风险度量，类似于VaR（分位数）和CVaR（超分位数），可用于风险管理。虽然基于VaR和CVaR统计的四边形已得到广泛使用，但本文专注于最近提出的基于期望值的四边形。本文旨在对这些期望值四边形的性质进行严格的研究，特别强调了一个包含期望值作为统计量和风险度量的四边形。",
