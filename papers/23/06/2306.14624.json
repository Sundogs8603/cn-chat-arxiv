Tracing the interaction of uncertainty, fairness and responsibility in insurance provides a fresh perspective on fairness in machine learning. We link insurance fairness conceptions to their machine learning relatives, and use this bridge to problematize fairness as calibration.

    "translated_abstract": "我们认为保险业可以作为机器学习系统社会环境的类比，从而使机器学习学者能够从丰富而跨学科的保险文献中获得启示。通过追踪保险中不确定性、公平性和责任的相互作用，为机器学习中的公平性问题提供了新的视角。我们将保险公平观念与机器学习的相关观念联系起来，并利用这个桥梁来问题化校准公平性。在这个过程中，我们突出了机器学习文献中经常被忽视的两个主题：责任和集合与个体之间的紧张关系。",
