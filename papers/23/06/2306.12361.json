    "translated_abstract": "多数关于状态和未知输入(UI)估计的文献都要求UI是线性的，这个限制可能太严格了，因为它并不适用于许多智能自主系统。为了克服这一限制，我们提出了一种无导数未知输入 Sigma-point 卡尔曼滤波器(SPKE-nUI)，其中 SPKF 与普通非线性 UI 估计器相互连接，可以通过非线性优化和数据驱动方法实现。非线性 UI 估计器使用后验状态估计，这对状态预测误差不太敏感。此外，我们引入了联合 sigma-point 变换方案，将状态和 UI 的不确定性纳入 SPKF-nUI 的估计中。深入的随机稳定性分析证明了在合理的假设下，所提出的 SPKF-nUI 可以产生指数级收敛的估计误差界限。最后，我们在基于模拟的路面车辆控制问题上进行了两个案例研究。",
