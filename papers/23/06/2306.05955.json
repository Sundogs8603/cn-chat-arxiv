    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）近期成为了学习图结构数据的标准方法。早先的研究揭示了它们的潜力，也揭示了它们的限制。不幸的是，标准的GNN在表达能力上存在局限性。在区分非同构图方面，这些模型的能力不超过一维Weisfeiler-Leman（1-WL）算法。本文提出了路径神经网络（PathNNs），该模型通过聚合从节点出发的路径来更新节点表示。我们推导出了三种不同的PathNN模型变体，以聚合单个最短路径、所有最短路径和所有长度不超过K的简单路径。我们证明了其中两个变体在表达能力上比1-WL算法严谨，同时我们通过实验证实了我们的理论结果。我们发现，PathNNs可以区分一些1-WL无法区分的非同构图对，而我们最表达丰富的PathNN变体具有更好的性能。",
