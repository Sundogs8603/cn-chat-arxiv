    "translated_abstract": "基于图的半监督节点分类已被证明是许多具有高研究价值和意义的应用中的最先进方法。大多数现有方法仅基于原始的内在或人为建立的图结构，这可能无法准确反映数据之间的“真实”相关性，并且对下游图神经网络中的半监督节点分类不是最优的。此外，现有的基于图的方法大多利用显式图结构，而一些隐式信息，例如密度信息，也可以提供潜在的信息，可以进一步利用。为了解决这些限制，本文提出了DualHGNN，一种新的双重连接模型，将超图结构学习和超图表示学习同时集成在统一的架构中。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了DualHGNN，利用双重超图神经网络模型，将超图结构学习和表示学习相结合，以更好地实现半监督节点分类。"
