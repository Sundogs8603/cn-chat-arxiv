    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of mental disorders and intervention can facilitate the prevention of severe injuries and the improvement of treatment results. Using social media and pre-trained language models, this study explores how user-generated data can be used to predict mental disorder symptoms. Our study compares four different BERT models of Hugging Face with standard machine learning techniques used in automatic depression diagnosis in recent literature. The results show that new models outperform the previous approach with an accuracy rate of up to 97%. Analyzing the results while complementing past findings, we find that even tiny amounts of data (like users' bio descriptions) have the potential to predict mental disorders. We conclude that social media data is an excellent source of mental health screening, and pre-trained models can effectively automate this critical task.",

    "translated_abstract": "早期诊断精神障碍并进行干预可以促进预防严重伤害和改善治疗效果。本研究利用社交媒体和预训练的语言模型，探讨用户生成的数据如何用于预测精神障碍症状。我们的研究比较了Hugging Face的四种不同BERT模型和近期文献中用于自动抑郁症诊断的标准机器学习技术。结果显示，新模型的准确率高达97%，超过了以前的方法。通过补充先前的发现，对结果进行分析，我们发现即使是微小的数据量（如用户的个人简介描述）也有预测精神障碍的潜力。我们得出结论，社交媒体数据是进行精神健康筛查的一个极好的来源，并且预训练模型可以有效自动化这一关键任务。",
