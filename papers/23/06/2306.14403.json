    "translated_abstract": "近年来，对于能够利用少量标注异常数据与大量未标注数据的异常检测方法受到越来越多的关注。现有的基于异常信息的异常检测方法依赖于人工预定义的分数目标，例如先前的常量或边距超参数，以实现对正常和异常数据之间的异常分数区分。然而，这种方法容易受到未标注数据中异常污染的影响，并且缺乏对不同数据场景的适应性。本文提出了一种基于分数分布优化的异常评分函数，从而更好地保留输入数据的多样性和更细粒度的信息，特别是当未标注数据包含更实际的异常噪声时。我们设计了一种称为Overlap Loss的新型损失函数，它最小化正常和异常样本的分数分布重叠区域，不再依赖于先前的异常信息或预定义的目标。在几个基准数据集上的实验证明，我们提出的方法优于现有的基于异常信息的异常检测方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an anomaly detection method based on score distribution discrimination, which minimizes the overlap area between the score distributions of normal and abnormal samples using the novel Overlap loss function, without requiring predefined score targets and with better adaptability to different data scenarios. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing anomaly-informed AD methods."
