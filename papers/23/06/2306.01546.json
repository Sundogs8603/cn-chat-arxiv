    "translated_abstract": "数字病理学和计算资源的进步对乳腺癌诊断和治疗的计算病理学领域产生了重大影响。 然而，获得高质量的标记乳腺癌组织学图像表示着一个重大难题，从而限制了准确和强大的深度学习模型的开发。 在这项系统性综述中，我们确定了可用于开发深度学习算法的公开可用的乳腺H＆E染色全切片图像（WSI）数据集。 我们系统地搜索了9个科学文献数据库和9个研究数据存储库。 我们找到了12个公开可用的数据集，包含5153个乳腺癌H&E WSI。 此外，我们针对每个数据集报告了图像元数据和特征，以帮助研究人员选择适合乳腺癌计算病理学具体任务的数据集。 另外，我们还编制了用于包括文章的修补程序和私有数据集的列表。 我们的综述强调了需要更全面和标准化的数据集，以促进准确和强大的乳腺癌诊断和治疗深度学习算法的发展。",
