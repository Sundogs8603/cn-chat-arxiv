    "abstract": "In online advertising markets, budget-constrained advertisers acquire ad placements through repeated bidding in auctions on various platforms. We present a strategy for bidding optimally in a set of auctions that may or may not be incentive-compatible under the presence of budget constraints. Our strategy maximizes the expected total utility across auctions while satisfying the advertiser's budget constraints in expectation. Additionally, we investigate the online setting where the advertiser must submit bids across platforms while learning about other bidders' bids over time. Our algorithm has $O(T^{3/4})$ regret under the full-information setting. Finally, we demonstrate that our algorithms have superior cumulative regret on both synthetic and real-world datasets of ad placement auctions, compared to existing adaptive pacing algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "在在线广告市场上，有预算限制的广告主通过在各种平台上反复竞标获得广告位置。我们提出了一种策略，用于在可能存在预算限制的激励兼容或非激励兼容情况下，优化竞标一组拍卖品。我们的策略最大化预期在各个拍卖中的总效用，同时满足广告主预期的预算限制。此外，我们研究了广告主必须在学习其他竞标者的出价情况的同时，跨平台提交竞标的在线设置。在全信息设置下，我们的算法具有 $O(T^{3/4})$ 的遗憾值。最后，我们证明了相比现有的自适应步伐算法，我们的算法在广告放置拍卖的合成和真实数据集上具有更优秀的累积遗憾值。",
