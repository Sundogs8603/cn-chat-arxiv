    "translated_abstract": "图像分割和配准在应用于动态对比增强MRI序列（DCE-MRI）时被认为是具有挑战性的。对比剂会导致感兴趣区域和其他区域的强度快速变化，这可能会导致分割任务的假阳性预测并混淆图像配准相似度度量。虽然广泛认为对比度变化会增加这些任务的难度，但据我们所知，没有任何研究量化这些影响。在本文中，我们研究了使用不同比例的增强对比（CE）数据训练对两个流行任务的影响：使用nnU-Net和Mask R-CNN进行分割以及使用VoxelMorph和VTN进行配准。我们进一步通过使用可用数据集来进行预训练和微调，进行了策略性实验。我们发现，为了创建一个通用模型，使用CE数据进行预训练并使用非CE数据进行微调可以获得最佳结果。这个有趣的发现可能可以扩展...",
