    "translated_title": "区别于差分的干扰效应：有限人口视角下的研究",
    "translated_abstract": "在许多情况下，如对基于地点的政策进行评估时，潜在结果不仅取决于单位本身的处理，还取决于其邻居的处理。尽管如此，“区别于差分”（DID）类型的估计器通常忽略邻居之间的干扰。本文指出，在邻居干扰存在的情况下，经典的DID估计器通常无法识别有趣的因果效应。为了将干扰结构引入DID估计中，笔者提出了双重稳健估计器，用于处理直接平均处理效应以及改进后的平行趋势假设下的平均溢出效应。当需要考虑溢出效应时，通常会对整个人口进行抽样。因此，本文采用了有限人口视角，即将估计量定义为人口平均值，并且推断是有条件的，基于所有人口单位的属性。本文提出的一般和统一的方法将干扰效应纳入到DID估计中，具有一定的研究价值。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes new doubly robust estimators to address the effects of neighborhood interference on the \"difference-in-differences\" type estimators. The approach, from a finite population perspective, can handle direct average treatment effect on the treated as well as average spillover effects under a modified parallel trends assumption. It has significant research value."
