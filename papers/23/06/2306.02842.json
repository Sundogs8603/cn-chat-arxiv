    "translated_abstract": "对话式推荐系统（CRSs）旨在通过自然语言对话提供推荐服务。虽然已经有多种方法用于开发有能力的CRSs，但通常需要足够的训练数据进行训练。由于难以注释面向推荐的对话数据集，现有的CRSs方法通常因训练数据的稀缺而受到不足的训练数据的问题。为了解决这个问题，在本文中，我们提出了一个名为CFCRS的CRS的反事实数据模拟方法，以减缓CRSs中数据不足的问题。我们的方法是基于反事实数据增强框架开发的，该框架逐步将重写到真实对话中的用户偏好中，而不干扰整个对话流程。为了开发我们的方法，我们通过涉及对话的实体来对用户偏好进行表征并组织对话流程，并设计了多阶段方法。",
