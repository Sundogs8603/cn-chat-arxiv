    "translated_abstract": "卷积神经网络已经成功应用于图像分类和目标分割等领域。为了提高网络的表现力，人们研究了各种技术，如新的CNN架构。但是，来自这些技术的性能提升往往会减弱。为解决这一挑战，许多研究人员把重点转向增加神经元的非线性，以增强网络表现力。然而，大多数这些方法会带来大量的参数，因此不可避免地会导致可部署性方面的低效率。在本研究中，提出了一种高效的二次神经元结构，以仅有微小参数和计算成本开销来保留非线性。所提出的二次神经元可以最大化利用二阶计算信息来改善网络性能。实验结果表明，所提出的二次神经元结构可以实现与现有非线性激活函数相比具有更少的参数和计算成本的竞争性能。",
