    "translated_abstract": "异常检测是一个重要领域，旨在识别意外的模式或数据点，并与许多现实世界的问题密切相关，尤其是在金融、制造、网络安全等应用中。虽然异常检测在各个领域已经被广泛研究，但在异常发生之前检测到未来的异常仍然是一个未开发的领域。在本文中，我们提出了一种新型的异常检测方法，称为“前体-异常”（PoA）检测。与传统的异常检测不同，传统的异常检测侧重于确定给定时间序列观测值是否为异常，而PoA检测旨在在异常发生之前检测到未来的异常。为了同时解决这两个问题，我们提出了一种基于神经控制微分方程的神经网络及其多任务学习算法。我们使用17个基准线和3个数据集进行实验，包括规则和不规则时间序列，并证明了我们的方法的有效性。",
