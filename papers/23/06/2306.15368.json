By adapting mean field theory for deep metric learning, we develop an approach to design classification-based loss functions from pair-based ones, which can be considered complementary to the proxy-based approach. Applying the mean field theory to two pair-based loss functions, we derive two new loss functions, MeanFieldContrastive and MeanFieldClassWiseMultiSimilarity losses, with reduced training complexity. We extensively evaluate these derived loss functions on three image-retrieval datasets and demonstrate that our loss functions outperform baseline methods in two out of the three datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了在深度度量学习中应用统计物理中的均场理论，并解决了传统度量学习损失函数所普遍存在的高训练复杂度问题。通过将均场理论应用于深度度量学习，我们提出了一种从基于对比度的损失函数设计分类损失函数的方法，这可以被认为是对基于代理的方法的补充。将均场理论应用于两种基于对比度的损失函数，我们推导出了两个新的损失函数，MeanFieldContrastive和MeanFieldClassWiseMultiSimilarity损失函数，其训练复杂度得到了降低。我们在三个图像检索数据集上对这些衍生损失函数进行了广泛评估，并证明我们的损失函数在三个数据集中的两个上胜过了基线方法。",
