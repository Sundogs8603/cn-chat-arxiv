    "abstract": "With the extensive accumulation of conversational data on the Internet, emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) has received increasing attention. Previous efforts of this task mainly focus on leveraging contextual and speaker-specific features, or integrating heterogeneous external commonsense knowledge. Among them, some heavily rely on future contexts, which, however, are not always available in real-life scenarios. This fact inspires us to generate pseudo future contexts to improve ERC. Specifically, for an utterance, we generate its future context with pre-trained language models, potentially containing extra beneficial knowledge in a conversational form homogeneous with the historical ones. These characteristics make pseudo future contexts easily fused with historical contexts and historical speaker-specific contexts, yielding a conceptually simple framework systematically integrating multi-contexts.

    "translated_abstract": "随着互联网上对话数据的广泛积累，对话情感识别（ERC）受到越来越多的关注。先前的工作主要集中在利用上下文和具体说话人的特征，或者整合异构的外部常识知识。其中一些工作严重依赖未来的上下文，然而在现实生活中未必总是可用。这一事实激发了我们生成伪未来上下文来提高ERC的想法。具体而言，对于一个话语，我们使用预训练的语言模型生成其未来上下文，可能包含了对对话过程中有益的额外知识，与历史上下文的形式保持一致。这些特点使得伪未来上下文容易与历史上下文和历史特定说话人的上下文相融合，形成一个概念上简单的系统，系统地集成了多个上下文。在四个ERC数据集上的实验证明了我们方法的优越性。",

By generating future contexts using pre-trained language models, historical contexts and speaker-specific contexts can be fused, resulting in a simple framework for integrating multiple contexts.
