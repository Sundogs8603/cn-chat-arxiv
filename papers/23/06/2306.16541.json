    "translated_abstract": "在线会议正在成为新的常态，为在线会议创造身临其境的体验已经成为刻不容缓的需求。高效真实人体渲染是实现身临其境会议的核心。目前流行的应用虽然能够实现实时会议，但在传递真实人体动态方面存在不足，要么是因为空间有限，要么是因为使用缺乏真实互动的化身。最近神经渲染技术的进步，比如神经辐射场（NeRF），为元宇宙会议提供了更高的真实感。然而，NeRF 的渲染速度较慢，对于实时会议带来了挑战。我们设想了一个未来的增强现实元宇宙会议系统的流程，它利用单目视频采集和自由视点合成来提高数据和硬件的效率。为了实现身临其境的会议体验，我们探索了一个加速的基于 NeRF 的自由视点渲染 pipeline，通过在渲染过程中的深度学习模型提供更高的真实感和交互性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents the design of a next-generation augmented reality conferencing system that proposes an efficient method for photorealistic human rendering. While current applications perform well in real-time conferencing, they fall short in delivering realistic human dynamics. The study leverages neural rendering techniques and utilizes monocular video acquisition and free-viewpoint synthesis to enhance the efficiency of the conferencing system and provide a higher level of realism and interactivity."
