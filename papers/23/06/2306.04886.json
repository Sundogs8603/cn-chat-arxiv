    "translated_abstract": "蛋白质-配体结合亲和力（PLBA）预测是药物发现中的基本任务。最近，各种基于深度学习的模型通过将蛋白质-配体复合物的三维结构作为输入并取得了惊人的进展来预测结合亲和力。然而，由于高质量训练数据的稀缺性，当前模型的泛化能力仍然有限。此外，不同的生物测定使用不同的亲和力测量标签（即IC50，Ki，Kd），不同的实验条件不可避免地会引入系统噪声，这对构建高精度亲和力预测模型构成了重大挑战。为了解决这些问题，我们（1）提出了多任务生物测定预训练（MBP），一种用于基于结构的PLBA预测的预训练框架;（2）构建了一个包含超过300k个实验测定亲和力标签和约2.8M个对接三维结构的预训练数据集，称为ChEMBL-Dock。",
