    "translated_abstract": "评估单个数据点的质量和影响对于提高模型性能和减轻训练数据集中不良偏差至关重要。尽管已经提出了几个数据估值算法来量化数据质量，但还缺乏一个系统化和标准化的数据估值基准测试系统。本文介绍了OpenDataVal，一种易于使用和统一的基准测试框架，使研究人员和从业者能够应用和比较各种数据估值算法。OpenDataVal提供了一个综合环境，包括（i）各种图像，自然语言和表格数据集，（ii）九种不同的最先进的数据估值算法的实现，以及（iii）可以导入任何scikit-learn模型的预测模型API。此外，我们提出了四个下游机器学习任务，用于评估数据值的质量。我们使用OpenDataVal进行基准测试分析，量化并比较不同数据估值算法在不同数据集上的表现。",
