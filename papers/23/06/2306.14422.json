    "translated_abstract": "我们呈现了声音转换挑战（VCC）系列的最新版本，这是一个每两年举行一次的科学活动，旨在比较和了解基于共同数据集的不同声音转换（VC）系统。今年，我们把重点转向了唱声转换（SVC），因此将挑战命名为唱声转换挑战（SVCC）。我们构建了一个新的数据库，用于两个任务，即域内和跨域SVC。挑战持续了两个月，我们共收到了26个提交，其中包括2个基准系统。通过大规模众包听力测试，我们观察到，对于两个任务，虽然顶尖系统实现了接近人类水平的自然度，但没有团队能够获得与目标发音者一样高的相似度评分。同时，正如预期的那样，跨域SVC比域内SVC更加困难，特别是在相似度方面。我们还研究了现有的客观评测方法是否能够预测主观性能，并发现只有很少的指标能够实现这一点。",
