However, some variables in the dynamical time-series are missing in some practical situations. In this study, we propose an autoregressive with slack time series (ARS) model. ARS model involves the simultaneous estimation of the evolution function and the underlying missing variables as a slack time series, with the aid of the time-invariance and linearity of the dynamical system.

    "translated_abstract": "动态系统产生一种依赖多元序列，称为动态时间序列，通过演化函数发展而来。由于当前时间点的动态时间序列变量通常依赖于前一个时间点的所有变量，现有研究通过估计演化函数来预测未来时间点的变量。然而，在某些实际情况下，动态时间序列中的一些变量是缺失的。本研究提出了一种自回归松弛时间序列（ARS）模型。ARS模型涉及演化函数和作为松弛时间序列的潜在缺失变量的同时估计，借助于动态系统的时间不变性和线性性。本研究实证了提出的ARS模型的有效性。",
