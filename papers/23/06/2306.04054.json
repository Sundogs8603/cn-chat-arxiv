    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in speech recognition, there are still difficulties in accurately transcribing conversational and emotional speech in noisy and reverberant acoustic environments. This poses a particular challenge in the search and rescue (SAR) domain, where transcribing conversations among rescue team members is crucial to support real-time decision-making. The scarcity of speech data and associated background noise in SAR scenarios make it difficult to deploy robust speech recognition systems.  To address this issue, we have created and made publicly available a German speech dataset called RescueSpeech. This dataset includes real speech recordings from simulated rescue exercises. Additionally, we have released competitive training recipes and pre-trained models. Our study indicates that the current level of performance achieved by state-of-the-art methods is still far from being acceptable.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管语音识别在最近得到了进一步发展，但在嘈杂、回声的环境中准确转录对话和情感表达仍然存在一定难度。在搜救领域尤其如此，因为转录救援队成员之间的对话对支持实时决策至关重要。搜救场景中语音数据和相关背景噪声的稀缺性使得部署健壮的语音识别系统变得困难。为了解决这个问题，我们创建并公开了一个名为RescueSpeech的德语语音数据集。该数据集包括模拟救援演习的真实语音录音。此外，我们还发布了竞争性训练配方和预训练模型。我们的研究表明，目前最先进的方法所达到的性能水平仍远未能令人满意。",
