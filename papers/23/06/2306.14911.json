    "abstract": "Hedges play an important role in the management of conversational interaction. In peer tutoring, they are notably used by tutors in dyads (pairs of interlocutors) experiencing low rapport to tone down the impact of instructions and negative feedback. Pursuing the objective of building a tutoring agent that manages rapport with students in order to improve learning, we used a multimodal peer-tutoring dataset to construct a computational framework for identifying hedges. We compared approaches relying on pre-trained resources with others that integrate insights from the social science literature. Our best performance involved a hybrid approach that outperforms the existing baseline while being easier to interpret. We employ a model explainability tool to explore the features that characterize hedges in peer-tutoring conversations, and we identify some novel features, and the benefits of such a hybrid model approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "措辞在对话互动中起着重要作用。在同伴辅导中，导师在缺乏默契的双人对话中使用措辞来减轻指令和负反馈的影响。为了建立一个管理与学生的亲密关系以提高学习效果的辅导代理系统，我们利用多模态同伴辅导数据集构建了一个用于识别措辞的计算框架。我们比较了依赖预训练资源和结合社会科学文献见解的方法。我们的最佳表现来自一个混合方法，其性能优于现有基准，并且更容易解释。我们使用一个模型可解释性工具探索了同伴辅导对话中特征的特点，并识别了一些新特征以及这种混合模型方法的好处。",
