    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型通常需要充分的监督（标记数据）才能有效地进行训练。相比之下，人类可以迅速学习识别医学图像（如磁共振和 CT 扫描中的重要解剖结构），只需要少量的指导。这种识别能力容易泛化到来自不同医疗机构的新图像以及不同设置中的新任务。这种快速且泛化的学习能力很大程度上是由于人脑中图像模式的组合结构，而当前的医学模型并不能很好地表示出这种结构。在本文中，我们研究利用组合性来学习更具有可解释性和泛化性的医学图像分割表示。具体而言，我们提出了一个假设：用于生成医学图像的基础生成因素满足组合等变性质，其中每个因素都是组合的（例如对应于人体解剖结构）并且对任务是等变的。因此，我们引入了一种方法来将组合等变性质纳入表示学习中，并展示了这种方法在各种医学图像分割任务上提高了泛化性能。",
