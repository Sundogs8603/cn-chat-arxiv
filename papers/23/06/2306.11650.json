    "translated_abstract": "联合学习已经因为无需对来自客户端的敏感数据进行聚合而变得受欢迎。但是，数据隔离的分布式和孤立性可能会受到数据质量的复杂性的影响，使其更容易受到噪声标签的干扰。许多努力都致力于在集中式或联合式环境中防御噪声标签的负面影响。然而，缺乏一个全面考虑各种典型联合学习场景中噪声标签影响的基准测试。在这项工作中，我们提供了第一个标准化的基准测试，可以帮助研究人员充分探索潜在的联合噪声设置。此外，我们进行了全面的实验，探索这些数据设置的特性，并揭示了联合学习中的挑战性场景，这可能指导未来的方法开发。我们强调我们基准测试中提出的20个基本设置，适用于5个以上的数据集，并提供了标准化的仿真流程。",
