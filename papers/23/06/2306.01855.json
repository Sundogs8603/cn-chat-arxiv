    "abstract": "Providing voice assistants the ability to navigate multi-turn conversations is a challenging problem. Handling multi-turn interactions requires the system to understand various conversational use-cases, such as steering, intent carryover, disfluencies, entity carryover, and repair. The complexity of this problem is compounded by the fact that these use-cases mix with each other, often appearing simultaneously in natural language. This work proposes a non-autoregressive query rewriting architecture that can handle not only the five aforementioned tasks, but also complex compositions of these use-cases. We show that our proposed model has competitive single task performance compared to the baseline approach, and even outperforms a fine-tuned T5 model in use-case compositions, despite being 15 times smaller in parameters and 25 times faster in latency.",

    "translated_abstract": "提供语音助手导航多轮对话的能力是一个具有挑战性的问题。 处理多轮互动需要系统理解各种会话用例，如对话引导、意图携带、语言中断、实体携带和修复。 这个问题的复杂性加剧了这些用例混合在一起的事实，通常同时在自然语言中出现。本文提出了一种非自回归的查询重写体系结构，可以处理五个任务以及这些用例的复杂组合。我们证明了我们提出的模型与基线方法具有相当的单任务性能，并且在用例组合方面甚至优于经过调优的T5模型，尽管在参数上小15倍，在延迟上快25倍。",
