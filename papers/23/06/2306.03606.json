    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱是表示生物医学实体之间复杂关系的重要工具。已经提出了一些方法来学习嵌入，可以用于预测这些图谱中的新链路。一些方法忽略了生物医学知识图谱中与实体相关的有价值的属性数据，如蛋白质序列或分子图。其他方法则包含此类数据，但假设实体可以用相同的数据模态表示。然而生物医学知识图谱中实体常常表现出异质模态，这是其在该领域中表示的关键。我们提出了一个用于学习带有实体属性的知识图谱嵌入的模块化框架，其允许对不同模态的属性数据进行编码，同时支持缺少属性的实体。此外，我们还提出了一种有效的预训练策略，以减少所需的训练时间。我们使用包含多模态实体数据的生物医学知识图谱进行模型训练。",
