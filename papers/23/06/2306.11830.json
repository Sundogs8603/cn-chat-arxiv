    "translated_abstract": "许多脑机接口利用对视觉、听觉或触觉刺激产生的大脑信号进行操作，这些信号被称为事件相关电位 (ERPs)。在视觉 ERP 拼写器应用中，在屏幕上随机闪烁一组字母，参与者关注他们想要拼写的目标字母。当这个字母闪烁时，产生的 ERP 与任何其他非目标字母闪烁时产生的 ERP 有所不同。我们提出了一种新的无监督方法来检测这个被关注的字母。在每次试验中，对于每个可用字母，我们的方法都假设这个字母实际上是关注的字母，并根据这些假设计算 ERPs。我们利用了只有真实假设才会在类均值之间产生最大差异的事实。值得注意的是，这种无监督方法不需要对基础实验范例进行任何更改，因此几乎可以应用于所有基于 ERP 的设置。为了处理有限的数据，我们使用了一个翻译模型来增加训练数据。我们的实验结果表明，我们的方法在两个公开数据集上优于现有的无监督和监督方法。",
