    "translated_abstract": "医学成像领域是医学科学的一个重要方面，涉及各种形式的辐射来捕获身体内部组织和器官的图像。这些图像为临床诊断提供了重要信息，本文探讨了X射线、MRI和核医学在发现严重疾病方面的应用。然而，手动评估和存储这些图像可能是一个具有挑战性和耗时的过程。为了解决这个问题，基于人工智能（AI）的技术，特别是深度学习（DL），已经越来越流行，用于从成像模态中进行系统特征提取和分类，从而帮助医生进行快速准确的诊断。在本综述研究中，我们将重点探讨基于AI的方法，特别是卷积神经网络（CNN）如何通过医学成像技术帮助疾病检测。CNN是一种常用的图像分析方法，因其能够学习复杂的图像特征并识别传统方法难以检测的模式而获得广泛应用。通过案例研究，我们将展示基于人工智能的医学成像在临床实践中的实际应用。",
