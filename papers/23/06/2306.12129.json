    "translated_abstract": "针织传感器经常受到固有效应（如偏移、松弛和漂移）的影响而产生不一致性。这些属性的结合使得从传感器数据到物理执行具有挑战性。在本文中，我们展示了一种利用最小人工神经网络（ANN）结合简单预处理方法来进行处理的方法来对抗这种不一致性。我们在重新采样过的传感器信号上应用了多个指数平滑滤波器，以产生保留不同历史传感器数据水平的特征，并结合表示以前传感器执行充分状态的特征。通过训练一个三层ANN，总共有8个神经元，我们成功地提高了传感器读数和执行力之间的映射。我们的研究发现，我们的技术对于材料和结构相当不同的传感器也是适用的，而且还可以应用于相关的物理特征。",
