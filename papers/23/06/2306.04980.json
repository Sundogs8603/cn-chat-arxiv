    "abstract": "This work introduces approaches to assessing phrase breaks in ESL learners' speech using pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs). There are two tasks: overall assessment of phrase break for a speech clip and fine-grained assessment of every possible phrase break position. To leverage NLP models, speech input is first force-aligned with texts, and then pre-processed into a token sequence, including words and phrase break information. To utilize PLMs, we propose a pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline with the processed tokens. This process includes pre-training with a replaced break token detection module and fine-tuning with text classification and sequence labeling. To employ LLMs, we design prompts for ChatGPT. The experiments show that with the PLMs, the dependence on labeled training data has been greatly reduced, and the performance has improved. Meanwhile, we verify that ChatGPT, a renowned LLM, has potential for further advancement in this area.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究介绍了利用预训练语言模型（PLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）评估非英语母语学习者语音中短语断点的方法。该研究包含两个任务：评估一个语音片段的总体短语断点和对每个可能的短语断点位置进行细粒度评估。为利用NLP模型，语音输入首先被强制对齐到文本，然后被预处理成一个包含单词和短语断点信息的标记序列。为了利用PLMs，我们提出了一个带有处理过的标记的预训练和微调流程。这个过程包括用一个替换破折号检测模块进行预训练，并用文本分类和序列标注进行微调。为了利用LLMs，我们给ChatGPT设计了提示。实验表明，使用PLMs大大降低了对标记的训练数据的依赖性，并且性能得到了提高。同时，我们验证了ChatGPT在这一领域进一步提升的潜力。",
