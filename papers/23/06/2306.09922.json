    "abstract": "When robots perform long action sequences, users will want to easily and reliably find out what they have done. We therefore demonstrate the task of learning to summarize and answer questions about a robot agent's past actions using natural language alone. A single system with a large language model at its core is trained to both summarize and answer questions about action sequences given ego-centric video frames of a virtual robot and a question prompt. To enable training of question answering, we develop a method to automatically generate English-language questions and answers about objects, actions, and the temporal order in which actions occurred during episodes of robot action in the virtual environment. Training one model to both summarize and answer questions enables zero-shot transfer of representations of objects learned through question answering to improved action summarization. % involving objects not seen in training to summarize.",

    "translated_abstract": "当机器人执行长序列的动作时，用户需要轻松、可靠地了解它们所做的事情。因此，我们演示了使用自然语言学习总结和回答关于机器人代理过去动作的问题的任务。一个核心为大型语言模型的单一系统被训练用于总结和回答关于虚拟机器人的自我中心视频帧和问题提示的动作序列。为了实现问题回答的训练，我们开发了一种方法来自动生成关于对象、动作和在虚拟环境中机器人动作序列期间动作发生的时间顺序的英文问题和答案。将一个模型用于总结和回答问题使得从问题回答中学习的对象表示的零-shot转移能够提高动作总结的能力，包括在训练中未见过的对象。",
    "tldr": "本论文介绍了一种学习总结和回答机器人动作历史的方法，能够通过一种语言模型同时完成总结和回答任务，并提供了自动生成问题和答案的方法来进行训练。此方法能够实现从问题回答中学习对象表示的零-shot转移。",
