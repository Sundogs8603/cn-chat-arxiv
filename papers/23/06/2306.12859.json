    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是一种分布式机器学习技术，它实现了数据隐私保护和数据共享计算之间的平衡。为了保护数据隐私，联邦学习通过在参与设备上本地执行分布式训练并将本地模型聚合成全局模型来学习共享模型。联邦学习存在的问题是，由于数据在不同用户终端上的非独立和相同分布所导致的负面影响。为了缓解这个问题，本文提出了一种基于自适应OPTICS聚类的增强型联邦聚合方法。具体来说，该方法将聚类环境视为马尔科夫决策过程，并对参数搜索方向的调整过程进行建模，以找到最佳聚类参数以达到最佳联邦聚合方法。本文的核心贡献是提出了一种适用于联邦学习的自适应OPTICS聚类算法，可有效提高联邦学习方法的性能。",
