    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT已在各种自然语言处理（NLP）任务中展示了出色的能力。然而，它从时间文本数据（尤其是财经新闻）推断动态网络结构的潜力仍是一个未开发的领域。在这项研究中，我们介绍了一个新的框架，利用ChatGPT的图推断能力来增强图神经网络（GNN）。我们的框架巧妙地从文本数据中提取出不断变化的网络结构，并将这些网络结构融合到图神经网络中，进行后续的预测任务。股票价格预测的实验结果表明，我们的模型始终优于基于深度学习的最新基准。此外，基于我们模型的产出构建的组合展示出更高的年化累计回报、更低的波动性和最大回撤。这种卓越表现突显了ChatGPT用于基于文本的网络推断和金融预测应用的潜力。",
