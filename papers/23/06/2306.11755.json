    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在给定因果图和某些形式为 $Q[S]:=P(S|do(V\\setminus S))$ 的观测和/或干预分布时，任意条件因果效应的可识别性问题。我们称此问题为条件广义可识别性问题（c-gID），并通过提供 c-gID 问题的完备算法证明了 Pearl 的 do-演算法对于 c-gID 问题的完备性。本文通过明确加入了可识别性所必需的正性假定，对 Lee 等人（2020）、Correa 等人（2021）中的 c-gID 问题进行了重新讨论。本文扩展了 Lee 等人（2019）、Kivva 等人（2022）的关于一般可识别性（gID）的研究，后者研究了无条件因果效应的问题，并扩展了 Shpitser 和 Pearl（2006b）的研究，后者仅给出观测分布 $P(\\mathbf{V})$ 的条件下条件因果效应的可识别性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the identifiability of arbitrary conditional causal effects with both causal graph and a set of observational and/or interventional distributions. It provides a complete and sound algorithm for this problem and extends previous results, leading to a better understanding of the identifiability of conditional causal effects."
