    "abstract": "We describe the systems of the University of Alberta team for the SemEval-2023 Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (V-WSD) Task. We present a novel algorithm that leverages glosses retrieved from BabelNet, in combination with text and image encoders. Furthermore, we compare language-specific encoders against the application of English encoders to translated texts. As the contexts given in the task datasets are extremely short, we also experiment with augmenting these contexts with descriptions generated by a language model. This yields substantial improvements in accuracy. We describe and evaluate additional V-WSD methods which use image generation and text-conditioned image segmentation. Overall, the results of our official submission rank us 18 out of 56 teams. Some of our unofficial results are even better than the official ones. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UAlberta-NLP/v-wsd.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们描述了Alberta大学团队用于SemEval-2023视觉词义消歧（V-WSD）任务的系统。我们提出了一种新颖的算法，该算法利用从BabelNet检索到的注释与文本和图像编码器相结合。此外，我们将特定于语言的编码器与将英文编码器应用于翻译文本进行了比较。由于任务数据集中给出的上下文非常短，因此我们还尝试使用语言模型生成的描述来增强这些上下文。这显著提高了准确性。我们还描述并评估了使用图像生成和文本条件图像分割的其他V-WSD方法。总体而言，我们官方提交的结果排名第18位。我们的非官方结果甚至比官方结果好。我们的代码可在https://github.com/UAlberta-NLP/v-wsd中公开使用。",
