    "translated_abstract": "图论是一个跨学科的研究领域，具有在数学建模和计算机科学中广泛的应用。图论研究不仅仅依赖于定理的创造，还涉及到猜想的提出。证伪算法通过在图上最大化某些得分函数来寻找反例，从而试图证伪猜想。本研究提出了一种新颖的猜想证伪算法，称为自适应蒙特卡罗搜索（AMCS）算法，通过修改蒙特卡罗树搜索算法得到。通过对其在发现数个图论猜想的反例方面的成功评估，AMCS优于现有的猜想证伪算法。该算法还被用于证伪了六个开放猜想，其中两个是由Liu等人于2021年提出的化学图论猜想，另外四个是AutoGraphiX计算机系统于2006年提出的猜想。最后，使用AMCS证明了其中四个开放猜想.",
