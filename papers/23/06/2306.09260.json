    "translated_abstract": "39秒。这是自2023年以来连续两次网络攻击之间的时间间隔。这意味着在您阅读完此摘要之前，世界上可能已经发生了1到2次额外的网络攻击。在网络威胁频率大幅增加的背景下，安全运营中心(SOC)和计算机应急响应团队(CERT)可能会不堪重负。为了减轻网络安全团队在调查工作中的负担，并帮助他们将重点放在更增值的任务上，机器学习方法和技术开始出现。本文介绍了一种新颖的方法IsoEx，用于在污染设备调查期间检测异常和潜在问题命令行。IsoEx围绕一组特征构建，这些特征利用命令行的日志结构以及其父/子关系，以实现比传统方法更高的准确性。为了检测异常，IsoEx采用了无监督的异常检测技术。",
