Our approach provides a closed form solution for the optimal fair multi-task predictor including both regression and binary classification tasks.

    "translated_abstract": "算法公平性是机器学习中的一个已经成熟的领域，旨在减少数据中的偏差。最近的进展提出了各种方法来确保单变量环境下的公平性，即目标是去除单个任务的偏差。然而，将公平性扩展到多任务环境，其中使用共享表示来优化多个目标，仍未得到充分开发。为了填补这一差距，我们利用多元Wasserstein barycenters将\\textit{Strong Demographic Parity}的定义扩展到多任务学习中。我们的方法为最优的公平多任务预测器提供了封闭式解，包括回归和二元分类任务。我们开发了一种数据驱动的估计过程，以寻找解决方案，并在合成和实际数据集上运行数字实验。经验结果突显了我们的后处理方法在促进公平决策方面的实际价值。",
