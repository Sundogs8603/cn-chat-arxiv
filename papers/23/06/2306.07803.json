    "translated_abstract": "复杂系统的特征是其实体之间的错综复杂的相互作用，这些相互作用随时间动态演变。准确推断这些动态关系对于理解和预测系统行为至关重要。在这篇论文中，我们提出了一种名为 Regulatory Temporal Interaction Network Inference (RiTINI) 的方法，使用空间与时间图注意力和图神经常微分方程的新颖组合，推断复杂系统中的变化的交互图。RiTINI利用图形先验的时间间隔信号以及在各个节点处的信号扰动，以有效地捕捉基础系统的动态。此方法不同于传统因果推断网络，后者仅限于推断非循环和静态图。相比之下，RiTINI能够推断循环、有向和时变图，提供了关于复杂系统更全面和准确的表示。RiTINI中的图形注意机制允许模型捕捉本地和全局依赖关系，而ODE表示方法使得连续与离散时间动态的集成成为可能。我们在合成和真实数据集上展示了RiTINI的有效性，展示了它在各个领域准确推断动态调控网络的能力。",
