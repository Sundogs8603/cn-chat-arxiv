    "abstract": "Existing reference-free turn-level evaluation metrics for chatbots inadequately capture the interaction between the user and the system. Consequently, they often correlate poorly with human evaluations. To address this issue, we propose a novel model-agnostic approach that leverages Conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (C-PMI) to measure the turn-level interaction between the system and the user based on a given evaluation dimension. Experimental results on the widely used FED dialogue evaluation dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the correlation with human judgment compared with existing evaluation systems. By replacing the negative log-likelihood-based scorer with our proposed C-PMI scorer, we achieve a relative 60.5% higher Spearman correlation on average for the FED evaluation metric. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/renll/C-PMI.",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的chatbot的无参考级对话评估指标不足以捕捉用户与系统之间的交互。因此，它们通常与人类评估的相关性较差。为解决这一问题，我们提出了一种新颖的模型无关方法，利用条件点对点互信息（C-PMI）来度量系统和用户之间基于给定评估维度的对话交互。在广泛使用的FED对话评估数据集上的实验结果表明，与现有评估系统相比，我们的方法显著提高了与人类判断的相关性。通过将基于负对数似然的评分器替换为我们提出的C-PMI评分器，我们在FED评估指标上的Spearman相关性平均相对提高了60.5%。我们的代码公开发布在https://github.com/renll/C-PMI。",
