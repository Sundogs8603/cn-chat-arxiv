    "translated_abstract": "近年来，出版的研究论文数量呈指数增长，因此开发新的高效、多功能的信息提取和知识发现方法十分重要。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种语义知识图谱（SKG），该图谱整合了来自摘要和其他元信息的语义概念来表示语料库。由于SKG中存储了高度多样化和丰富的信息内容，因此它可以支持各种学术文献的语义查询。为了从非结构化文本中提取知识，我们开发了一个知识提取模块，其中包括半监督管道用于实体提取和实体归一化。我们还创建了一个本体论以将这些概念与其他元信息整合，从而构建了SKG。此外，我们设计并开发了一个数据流系统，演示如何在SKG上灵活、交互地进行各种语义查询。为了证明我们的框架的有效性，我们对大规模的学术出版数据集进行了广泛的实验，并说明了SKG如何协助学术研究任务，包括文献综述、查询回答和推荐。",
