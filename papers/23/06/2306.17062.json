    "translated_abstract": "近年来，利用6 GHz以下的信道状态信息（CSI）广泛应用于Wi-Fi感知，特别是活动和手势识别。本文中，我们探索了mmWave（60 GHz）Wi-Fi信号用于手势识别/姿势估计。我们的重点是mmWave Wi-Fi信号，不仅可以用于高速数据通信，还可以用于提高感知，在XR应用中更有用。为此，我们从IEEE 802.11ad设备使用的周期性波束训练中提取空间波束信号-to-noise ratios (SNRs) 。我们考虑了一组由XR应用驱动的10个手势/姿势。我们在两个环境和三人身上进行实验。作为比较，我们还收集了IEEE 802.11ac设备的CSI。我们利用深度神经网络（DNN）从CSI和波束SNR中提取特征。DNN分类器在单一环境中的波束SNR任务上取得了令人满意的结果，达到了最新技术水平的96.7%的准确率。",
