    "abstract": "Twitter is a social media platform bridging most countries and allows real-time news discovery. Since the tweets on Twitter are usually short and express public feelings, thus provide a source for opinion mining and sentiment analysis for global events. This paper proposed an effective solution, in providing a sentiment on tweets related to the FIFA World Cup. At least 130k tweets, as the first in the community, are collected and implemented as a dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed machine learning solution. These tweets are collected with the related hashtags and keywords of the Qatar World Cup 2022. The Vader algorithm is used in this paper for sentiment analysis. Through the machine learning method and collected Twitter tweets, we discovered the sentiments and fun facts of several aspects important to the period before the World Cup. The result shows people are positive to the opening of the World Cup.",
