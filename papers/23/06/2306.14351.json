    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to make clear and precise the relationship between the Rubin causal model (RCM) and structural causal model (SCM) frameworks for causal inference. Adopting a neutral logical perspective, and drawing on previous work, we show what is required for an RCM to be representable by an SCM. A key result then shows that every RCM -- including those that violate algebraic principles implied by the SCM framework -- emerges as an abstraction of some representable RCM. Finally, we illustrate the power of this ameliorative perspective by pinpointing an important role for SCM principles in classic applications of RCMs; conversely, we offer a characterization of the algebraic constraints implied by a graph, helping to substantiate further comparisons between the two frameworks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在阐明潜在结果模型（RCM）与结构因果模型（SCM）框架在因果推断中的关系。采用中立的逻辑视角，借鉴以前的研究成果，我们展示了RCM成为SCM可表达的条件。一个关键结果显示，每个RCM -- 包括那些违反SCM框架中暗示的代数原则的RCM -- 作为某些可表达的RCM的抽象而出现。最后，我们通过准确定位SCM原则在RCM经典应用中的重要作用，阐明了这种改进性视角的优势；反之，我们提供了由图表示的代数约束的特征，有助于进一步比较两个框架。",
