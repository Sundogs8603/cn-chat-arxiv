    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning has revolutionized the field of natural language processing, with neural language models proving to be very effective for next-word prediction. However, a rigorous theoretical explanation for their success in the context of formal language theory has not yet been developed, as it is unclear why neural language models can learn the combinatorial rules that govern the next-word prediction task. In this paper, we study a class of formal languages that can be used to model real-world examples of English sentences. We construct neural language models can solve the next-word prediction task in this context with zero error. Our proof highlights the different roles of the embedding layer and the fully connected component within the neural language model.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，深度学习在自然语言处理领域引起了革命，神经语言模型在下一个词预测方面证明了非常有效。然而，在形式语言理论的背景下，关于神经语言模型在此任务中可以学习到组合规则的成功的严格理论解释尚未被提出，因为尚不清楚为什么神经语言模型可以学习到控制下一个词预测任务的组合规则。在本文中，我们研究了一类可以用来模拟英语句子的现实世界示例的形式语言。我们构建了神经语言模型来解决这种情况下的下一个词预测任务，且错误率为零。我们的证明突出了嵌入层和全连接组件在神经语言模型中的不同作用。",
