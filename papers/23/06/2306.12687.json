    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱以本体论支持的语义丰富结构表示实体及其关系。基于机器学习方法探索这个数据通常依赖于知识图谱嵌入，它可产生实体的潜在表示，保留结构和本地图邻域特性，但牺牲了可解释性。然而，在像链接或关系预测等任务中，了解哪些具体特征更好地解释关系对于支持复杂或关键应用至关重要。本文提出了一种名为SEEK的新型方法，用于解释支持知识图谱关系预测的表示。它基于识别实体之间相关的共享语义方面（即子图），并学习每个子图的表示，生成一个多方面和可解释的表示。我们将SEEK评估于两个真实世界中高度复杂的关系预测任务：蛋白质相互作用预测和基因-疾病关联性预测。",
