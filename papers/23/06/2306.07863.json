Synapse consists of three main components: 1) state-conditional decomposition, which divides demonstrations into exemplar sets based on the agent's need for new environment states, enabling temporal abstraction; 2) structured prompting, which filters states and reformulates task descriptions for each set to improve planning correctness; and 3) exemplar retrieval, which associates incoming tasks with corresponding exemplars in an exemplar database for multi-task adaptation and generalization.

    "translated_abstract": "本文探究了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）提示少量示例来进行计算机自动化的设计。虽然以前的提示方法着重于自我纠正，但我们发现仅仅有良好结构的示例就足以实现人类级别的性能。我们提出了 Synapse，一种上下文计算机控制代理，在 MiniWob++ 基准测试中展现了人类级别的性能。Synapse 由三个主要组件组成：1）状态条件分解，根据代理需要新环境状态将演示分为示例集，实现了时间抽象；2）结构化提示，过滤状态并重新构造每个集合的任务描述以改善计划的正确性；3）示例检索，将传入的任务与示例数据库中的对应示例相关联，以实现多任务适应和泛化。Synapse 克服了上下文长度限制，减少了多步控制中的错误，可以更有效灵活地使用语言模型进行计算机自动化。",
