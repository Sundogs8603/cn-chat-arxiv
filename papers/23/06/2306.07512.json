    "translated_abstract": "本文主要研究真实世界知识图谱（KG）上的思辨性推理任务，其中包括了假负问题（即潜在的真实事实被排除）和假正问题（即不可靠或过时的事实被包括）。现有的方法在思辨性推理能力上表现不佳，因为它们假设一个事实是否正确仅由它在KG中的存在确定，这使得它们容易受到假阴性/假阳性问题的影响。新的推理任务被规定为一种嘈杂正-无标记学习问题。我们提出了一种变分框架nPUGraph，它共同估计已收集和未收集事实的正确性（我们称之为“标签后验概率”），并在训练期间更新模型参数。标签后验概率估计从两个方面促进了思辨性推理。首先，它提高了标签后验概率感知的图表征对抗假阳性关系的鲁棒性。其次，它确定了误导性的未标记数据，并减少了其对模型训练的影响。我们还介绍了一种利用未标记数据的自训练策略，进一步提高了模型的推理能力。在两个知识图推理任务基准测试上的实验结果证明了我们提出的方法的有效性。",
