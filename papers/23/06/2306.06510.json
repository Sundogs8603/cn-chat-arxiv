We further constrain the domain shift to have a restrictive influence on the changing components.

    "translated_abstract": "无监督领域适应对于许多没有目标域标签信息的实际应用至关重要。通常情况下，如果没有进一步的假设，特征和标签的联合分布在目标域中是不可识别的。为了解决这个问题，我们依赖跨域因果机制的最小改变属性，以最小化分布转移的不必要影响。为了编码这个属性，我们首先使用一个带有两个分区潜变量子空间的潜变量模型来制定数据生成过程：不变部分的分布在跨域时保持不变，而稀疏的可变部分会在不同的域中发生变化。我们进一步限制了域移位对可变部分的影响。在温和的条件下，我们展示了部分可识别的潜变量，从而证明了目标域中数据和标签的联合分布也是可识别的。",
