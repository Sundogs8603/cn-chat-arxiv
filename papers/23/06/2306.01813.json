To answer this question, we propose a method to determine the minimum order of a hypergraph necessary to approximate the corresponding dynamics accurately. Specifically, we develop an analytical framework that allows us to determine this order when the type of dynamics is known. We utilize these ideas in conjunction with a hypergraph neural network to directly learn the dynamics itself and the resulting order of the hypergraph from both synthetic and real data sets consisting of observed system trajectories.",

    "translated_abstract": "超图动力系统可以展现出与成对交互系统不可观察到的丰富的行为。对于具有假设超图结构的分布式动力系统来说，有一个有趣的问题，即实际上有多少超图结构才是需要的，才能忠实地复制观察到的动态行为。为了回答这个问题，我们提出了一种方法来确定必要的最小超图顺序，以精确地近似相应的动力学。具体而言，当已知动力学类型时，我们开发了一个分析框架，以确定此顺序。我们将这些构想与超图神经网络结合使用，直接从包含观察到的系统轨迹的合成和真实数据集中学习动力学本身和超图的顺序。",
