The authors propose a novel online learning algorithm that combines convex optimization techniques and ideas from the knapsack literature, to handle any online learning problem with replenishment. Under an adversarial input model, the framework guarantees a constant competitive ratio when the budget is sufficiently large or when there is a positive constant per-round replenishment, and under a stochastic input model, the algorithm yields an instance-independent competitive ratio of $\\alpha\\log B$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant depending on the problem instance and resource consumption, and $B$ is the budget."
