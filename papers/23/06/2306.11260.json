However, previous works only focus on the identification of opinion expressions, forget that the diversity of opinion expressions also has great impacts on the ABSA task. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel counterfactual data augmentation method to generate opinion expression with reversed sentiment polarity. Specially, the integrated gradients are calculated to identify and mask the opinion expression. Then, a prompt with the reverse label is combined to the original text, and a pre-trained language model (PLM), T5, is finally employed to retrieve the masks.

    "translated_abstract": "方面情感分析 (ABSA) 是一项细粒度的情感评估任务，它分析评估方面的情感极性。然而，以往的工作仅关注观点表达的识别，而忽略了观点表达的多样性对ABSA任务的影响。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的基于对照的数据增强方法，用于生成具有相反情感极性的观点表达。具体而言，我们使用集成梯度来识别和屏蔽观点表达。然后将反向标签的提示组合到原始文本中，并最终利用预训练语言模型 (PLM) T5 来检索掩码。实验结果表明，所提出的对照数据增强方法在三个ABSA数据集 (即Laptop，Restaurant和MAMS) 上的表现优于当前的增强方法。",
