    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，用于严格验证大规模机器学习模型性能的计算工具取得了显著进展。最成功的求解器采用了高度专业化的、GPU加速的分支和界限算法。这样的工具对于在安全关键系统中成功部署机器学习应用至关重要，例如电力系统。然而，尽管取得了成功，仍然存在障碍阻止了将这些求解器直接应用于电力系统问题。本文通过两种关键方式解决了这个问题。首先，我们首次启用了多个验证问题的同时验证（例如，同时检查所有线路流量约束的违规，并非通过解决单个验证问题）。为此，我们引入了一种精确的转换，将一组潜在违规中的最坏情况违规转化为一系列基于ReLU的层，从而增加了原始神经网络的能力。",
