In this regard, Document Layout Analysis (DLA) has been an interesting research field for many years, which aims to detect and classify the basic components of a document. In this work, we used a procedure to semi-automatically annotate digital documents with different layout labels, including 4 basic layout blocks and 4 text categories. We apply this procedure to collect a novel database for DLA in the public affairs domain, using a set of 24 data sources from the Spanish Administration. The database comprises ",

    "translated_abstract": "每天都会生成成千上万个数字文档，其中包含对公司、公共组织和公民有用的信息。鉴于手动处理这些文档的不可能性，在某些行业中自动处理这些文档变得越来越必要。然而，这项任务仍然具有挑战性，因为在大多数情况下，仅基于文本的解析是不足以完全理解通过不同重要性的不同组件呈现的信息的。在这方面，文档布局分析（DLA）多年来一直是一个有趣的研究领域，旨在检测和分类文档的基本组件。在这项工作中，我们使用一种程序对数字文档进行半自动注释，包括4个基本布局块和4个文本类别的不同布局标签。我们应用此程序在20四个来自西班牙政府的数据源上收集了一个公共事务领域的DLA新数据库。该数据库包含......",
