    "abstract": "Solving symbolic reasoning problems that require compositionality and systematicity is considered one of the key ingredients of human intelligence. However, symbolic reasoning is still a great challenge for deep learning models, which often cannot generalize the reasoning pattern to out-of-distribution test cases. In this work, we propose a hybrid system capable of solving arithmetic problems that require compositional and systematic reasoning over sequences of symbols. The model acquires such a skill by learning appropriate substitution rules, which are applied iteratively to the input string until the expression is completely resolved. We show that the proposed system can accurately solve nested arithmetical expressions even when trained only on a subset including the simplest cases, significantly outperforming both a sequence-to-sequence model trained end-to-end and a state-of-the-art large language model.",

    "translated_abstract": "解决需要组合性和系统性的符号推理问题被认为是人类智能的关键因素之一。然而，符号推理对于深度学习模型仍然是一个巨大的挑战，它们往往无法将推理模式推广到超出分布范围的测试案例。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个混合系统，能够解决需要对符号序列进行组合和系统推理的算术问题。该模型通过学习适当的替换规则来获得这种技能，这些规则被迭代地应用于输入字符串，直到表达式完全解析。我们展示了该系统能够准确地解决嵌套算术表达式，即使仅在包括最简单情况的子集上进行训练，其性能也显著优于端到端训练的序列到序列模型和最先进的大型语言模型。",
