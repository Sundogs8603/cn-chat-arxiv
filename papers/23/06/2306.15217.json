    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了无监督的剧集生成方法，通过元学习来解决没有标签的少样本节点分类问题。主流的少样本节点分类的元学习方法是在存在大量有标签节点用于训练的情况下开发的，然而在现实世界中可能无法获得这样的数据。虽然已经提出了一些解决标签稀缺性问题的研究，但它们仍然依赖于有限数量的有标签数据，这限制了对图中所有节点信息的充分利用。尽管自监督学习方法在没有标签的节点分类问题上很有效，但它们主要学习通用的节点嵌入，没有考虑要解决的下游任务，这可能限制了其性能。在这项工作中，我们提出了无监督的剧集生成方法，以利用它们在少样本节点分类任务中的泛化能力，同时解决标签稀缺性问题。我们首先提出了一种利用图增强方法的方法",
