To address this challenge, we propose a post-processing approach that leverages a data-driven method to repair the topology of disconnected pulmonary tubular structures.

    "translated_abstract": "准确的肺气道和血管分割对于肺部疾病的诊断和治疗至关重要。然而，目前的深度学习方法存在连接性问题，限制了其临床应用性。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种后处理方法，利用数据驱动的方法修复断开的肺部管状结构的拓扑结构。我们的方法将问题形式化为关键点检测任务，通过训练神经网络来预测可以连接断开组件的关键点。我们使用训练数据生成管状结构的断开数据。此外，新的肺部树修复（PTR）数据集公开可用，包括800个完整的三维模型，包括肺气道、动脉和静脉，以及合成的断开数据。我们的代码和数据可在https://github.com/M3DV/pulmonary-tree-repairing上获得。",
