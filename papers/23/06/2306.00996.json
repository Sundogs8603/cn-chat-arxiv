    "abstract": "The study of speech disorders can benefit greatly from time-aligned data. However, audio-text mismatches in disfluent speech cause rapid performance degradation for modern speech aligners, hindering the use of automatic approaches. In this work, we propose a simple and effective modification of alignment graph construction of CTC-based models using Weighted Finite State Transducers. The proposed weakly-supervised approach alleviates the need for verbatim transcription of speech disfluencies for forced alignment. During the graph construction, we allow the modeling of common speech disfluencies, i.e. repetitions and omissions. Further, we show that by assessing the degree of audio-text mismatch through the use of Oracle Error Rate, our method can be effectively used in the wild. Our evaluation on a corrupted version of the TIMIT test set and the UCLASS dataset shows significant improvements, particularly for recall, achieving a 23-25% relative improvement over our baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "语言障碍的研究可以受益于时间对齐数据。然而，失语性言语中的音频-文本不匹配会导致现代语音对齐器的性能快速下降，从而阻碍了自动方法的使用。本文提出了一个简单有效的解决方法，即使用加权有限状态转换器对CTC模型的对齐图构建进行改进。该弱监督方法减轻了对失语性言语逐字转录实现强制对齐的需求。在图的构建过程中，我们允许对常见的失语现象进行建模，即重复和省略。此外，通过使用Oracle错误率评估音频-文本不匹配程度，我们的方法可以有效地在实际应用中使用。我们对TIMIT测试集和UCLASS数据集的损坏版本进行评估，显示出显著的改进，特别是召回率方面，在相对基线上实现了23-25%的相对改进。",
