    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个统计框架，可以通过人工智能来改善人类的决策。首先将每个人类决策者的表现与机器预测进行基准测试；然后用所提出的人工智能算法的建议替换决策制定者的一个子集所做出的决策。利用全国大型孕产结果和繁殖年龄夫妇孕前检查的医生诊断数据集，我们试验了一种启发式高频率方法以及一种贝叶斯后验损失函数方法，并将其应用于异常出生检测。我们发现，我们的算法在一个测试数据集上的结果比仅由医生诊断的结果具有更高的总体真阳性率和更低的假阳性率。我们还发现，来自农村地区的医生的诊断更容易被替代，这表明人工智能辅助决策制定更容易提高精确度。",

By benchmarking human performance against machine predictions, the algorithm replaces the decisions made by a subset of decision makers with its recommendations. Experimenting with pregnancy outcomes and doctor diagnoses, the algorithm showed higher true positive rates and lower false positive rates compared to doctors alone, particularly in rural areas where doctors' diagnoses were more frequently replaceable."
