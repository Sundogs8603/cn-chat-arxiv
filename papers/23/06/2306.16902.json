    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在医学、科学和法律等多个重要领域展现出了在概念间进行因果分析的卓越能力。最近对LLM在各种因果发现和推理任务中的表现的研究已经为经典的三阶段因果框架带来了一个新的阶梯。本文通过提出一个将基于知识的LLM因果分析与基于数据的因果结构学习相结合的新框架，推进了目前基于LLM的因果发现的研究。为了使LLM不只是一个查询工具，充分利用其在发现自然和新的因果定律方面的能力，我们将LLM对现有因果机制的宝贵专业知识融入客观数据的统计分析中，构建了一个新颖且实用的因果结构学习的基准。我们引入了一组通用的提示，旨在从给定变量中提取因果图，并评估LLM之前因果性对恢复因果关系的影响。",
