    "abstract": "Recent research on dialogue state tracking (DST) focuses on methods that allow few- and zero-shot transfer to new domains or schemas. However, performance gains heavily depend on aggressive data augmentation and fine-tuning of ever larger language model based architectures. In contrast, general purpose language models, trained on large amounts of diverse data, hold the promise of solving any kind of task without task-specific training. We present preliminary experimental results on the ChatGPT research preview, showing that ChatGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot DST. Despite our findings, we argue that properties inherent to general purpose models limit their ability to replace specialized systems. We further theorize that the in-context learning capabilities of such models will likely become powerful tools to support the development of dedicated and dynamic dialogue state trackers.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近关于对话状态跟踪（DST）的研究专注于允许少量和零-shot转移到新领域或模式的方法。然而，性能提升严重依赖于积极的数据增强和基于越来越大的语言模型的微调。相比之下，通用语言模型在大量多样化数据的基础上训练，承诺可以解决任何类型的任务而无需特定的训练。我们在ChatGPT研究预览中呈现了初步实验结果，表明ChatGPT在零-shot DST中实现了最先进的性能。尽管我们的发现如此，但我们认为通用模型固有的特性限制了它们替换专用系统的能力。我们进一步推测，这种模型的上下文学习能力可能成为支持专门和动态对话状态跟踪器开发的强大工具。",
