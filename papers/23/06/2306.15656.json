    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了SparseOptimizer，一种新颖的深度学习优化器，通过Moreau-Yosida正则化在大型语言模型（如BERT，ALBERT和GPT）中自然地引入稀疏性。SparseOptimizer设计的关键是嵌入的收缩操作符，它在优化过程中直接引入稀疏性。这个操作符通过坚实的理论框架支持，并包含了一个分析解，从而增强了优化器的鲁棒性和效果。重要的是，SparseOptimizer的即插即用功能消除了对代码修改的需求，使其成为适用于各种大型语言模型的通用适应工具。在GLUE、RACE、SQuAD1和SQuAD2等基准数据集上的实证评估表明，通过SparseOptimizer稀疏化后的SparseBERT和SparseALBERT在性能上与密集型的BERT和ALBERT相当，同时显著减少了参数数量。",
