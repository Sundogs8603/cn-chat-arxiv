    "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach to solving dynamic programming problems, such as those in many economic models, on a quantum annealer, a specialized device that performs combinatorial optimization. Quantum annealers attempt to solve an NP-hard problem by starting in a quantum superposition of all states and generating candidate global solutions in milliseconds, irrespective of problem size. Using existing quantum hardware, we achieve an order-of-magnitude speed-up in solving the real business cycle model over benchmarks in the literature. We also provide a detailed introduction to quantum annealing and discuss its potential use for more challenging economic problems.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种新方法，使用量子退火器解决动态规划问题，例如许多经济模型中的问题。量子退火器是一种专门用于组合优化的设备，它尝试通过在所有状态的量子叠加态中开始，以毫秒为单位生成候选的全局解，而不考虑问题规模。使用现有的量子硬件，我们在解决实际商业周期模型方面取得了数量级的加速，优于文献中的基准。我们还详细介绍了量子退火，并讨论了它在解决更具挑战性的经济问题方面的潜在用途。",
