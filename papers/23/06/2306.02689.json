    "translated_abstract": "最小最大路径问题旨在最小化所有代理商协同访问所有城市的最大旅游长度，即完成时间。这些问题包括有影响力的实际应用，但被认为是NP困难的。现有方法面临挑战，特别是在需要协调众多代理商覆盖数千个城市的大规模问题中。本文提出了一个新的深度学习框架来解决大规模的最小最大路径问题。我们将多个代理商的同时决策建模为顺序生成过程，允许利用可扩展的深度学习模型进行顺序决策。在顺序近似问题中，我们提出了一个可扩展的上下文Transformer模型Equity-Transformer，它生成考虑其他代理商之间公平工作负载的顺序动作。Equity-Transformer的有效性通过其在两个代表性最小最大路径问题中具有卓越的性能得到证明。",
