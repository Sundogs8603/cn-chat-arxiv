    "translated_abstract": "在随机零阶优化中，了解如何充分利用底层目标函数的局部几何结构是一个实际相关的问题。我们考虑一种基本情况，即目标函数是二次型的，并且提供了最优Hessian相关样本复杂度的第一个紧密刻画。我们的贡献具有双重性质。首先，从信息论的角度出发，通过引入一种称为能量分配的概念来捕捉搜索算法和目标函数几何结构之间的交互，证明了Hessian相关复杂度的紧密下界。通过解决最优能量谱，得到了配套的上限。其次，算法方面，我们展示了存在一种Hessian无关的算法，能够普遍实现所有Hessian实例的渐近最优样本复杂度。我们算法能够实现的渐近最优样本复杂度对于重尾噪声分布仍然有效。",
