    "abstract": "We present a constraint-based algorithm for learning causal structures from observational time-series data, in the presence of latent confounders. We assume a discrete-time, stationary structural vector autoregressive process, with both temporal and contemporaneous causal relations. One may ask if temporal and contemporaneous relations should be treated differently. The presented algorithm gradually refines a causal graph by learning long-term temporal relations before short-term ones, where contemporaneous relations are learned last. This ordering of causal relations to be learnt leads to a reduction in the required number of statistical tests. We validate this reduction empirically and demonstrate that it leads to higher accuracy for synthetic data and more plausible causal graphs for real-world data compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于约束的算法，用于从观测时间序列数据中学习因果结构，在存在潜在混淆因素的情况下。我们假设存在离散时间、稳态结构向量自回归过程，具有时态和同时性因果关系。我们提出的算法会逐步通过先学习长期的时态关系而不是短期的关系（同时性关系最后学习），逐步完善因果图。这种关系排序的学习方法导致所需的统计检验次数减少。我们在实验中通过合成数据验证了这种减少，同时证明与最先进的算法相比，这种减少会导致真实世界数据的更高准确性和更合理的因果图。",
