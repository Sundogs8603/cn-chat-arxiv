Instead, recent work has adapted conformal prediction to produce outcome intervals. Unfortunately this family of methods tends to be overly conservative, sometimes giving uninformative intervals. We introduce an alternative approach termed Caus-Modens, for characterizing causal outcome intervals by modulated ensembles. Motivated from Bayesian statistics and ensembled uncertainty quantification, Caus-Modens gives tighter outcome intervals in practice, measured by the necessary interval size to achieve sufficient coverage on three separate benchmarks. The last benchmark is a novel usage of GPT-4 for observational experiments with unknown but probeable ground truth.",

    "translated_abstract": "在存在隐藏混淆因素的情况下进行确切个体治疗结果的因果推断很少可能。因此，最近的研究改进了符合性预测方法，以产生结果区间。不幸的是，这类方法往往过于保守，有时会给出无信息量的区间。我们介绍了一种另类方法Caus-Modens，用于通过调制集合来描述因果结果区间。受到贝叶斯统计和集成不确定性量化的启发，Caus-Modens在实践中给出更紧密的结果区间，并通过三个分离基准测试的必要区间大小来实现足够的覆盖率。最后一个基准是使用未知但可探明的基础事实开展观察实验的GPT-4的新型用途。",
