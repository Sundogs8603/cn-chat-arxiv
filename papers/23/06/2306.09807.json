    "abstract": "This paper introduces FALL-E, a foley synthesis system and its training/inference strategies. The FALL-E model employs a cascaded approach comprising low-resolution spectrogram generation, spectrogram super-resolution, and a vocoder. We trained every sound-related model from scratch using our extensive datasets, and utilized a pre-trained language model. We conditioned the model with dataset-specific texts, enabling it to learn sound quality and recording environment based on text input. Moreover, we leveraged external language models to improve text descriptions of our datasets and performed prompt engineering for quality, coherence, and diversity. FALL-E was evaluated by an objective measure as well as listening tests in the DCASE 2023 challenge Task 7. The submission achieved the second place on average, while achieving the best score for diversity, second place for audio quality, and third place for class fitness.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种名为“FALL-E”的佛利音效合成系统及其训练/推断策略。FALL-E模型采用级联方法，包括低分辨率频谱图生成、频谱图超分辨率和声码器。我们从头开始使用大量数据集训练了每个与声音相关的模型，并使用预训练的语言模型。我们使用数据集特定的文本将模型进行条件训练，使其能够根据文本输入了解声音质量和录音环境。此外，我们利用外部语言模型改善了我们的数据集的文本描述，并进行了质量、连贯性和多样性的提示工程。FALL-E在DCASE 2023挑战赛任务7中进行了客观评估和听力测试。提交结果在平均得分上获得第二名，同时在多样性上得分最高，在音频质量上获得第二名，在类适应性上获得第三名。",
