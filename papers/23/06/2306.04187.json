    "abstract": "The machine reading comprehension (MRC) of user manuals has huge potential in customer service. However,current methods have trouble answering complex questions. Therefore, we introduce the Knowing-how & Knowing-that task that requires the model to answer factoid-style, procedure-style, and inconsistent questions about user manuals. We resolve this task by jointly representing the steps and facts in a graph (TARA), which supports a unified inference of various questions. Towards a systematical benchmarking study, we design a heuristic method to automatically parse user manuals into TARAs and build an annotated dataset to test the model's ability in answering real-world questions. Empirical results demonstrate that representing user manuals as TARAs is a desired solution for the MRC of user manuals. An in-depth investigation of TARA further sheds light on the issues and broader impacts of future representations of user manuals. We hope our work can move the MRC of user manuals to a more",

    "translated_abstract": "用户手册的机器阅读理解具有巨大的客户服务潜力。然而，当前的方法在回答复杂问题方面存在困难。因此，我们介绍了知道如何与知道什么的任务，要求模型回答关于用户手册的基本事实、流程，并解决一些不一致的问题。我们通过在图(TARA)中联合表示步骤和事实来解决这个任务，支持各种问题的统一推理。为了进行系统化的基准评估研究，我们设计了一种启发式方法，自动将用户手册解析成TARA，并构建了一个注释数据集，以测试模型在回答实际问题方面的能力。实证结果表明，将用户手册表示为TARA是用户手册机器阅读理解的理想解决方案。对TARA的深入研究进一步阐明了未来用户手册表示的问题和广泛的影响。我们希望我们的工作可以将用户手册的机器阅读理解推向更实用和有效的水平。",
