In this work, we propose a small and efficient neural-network based model for determining whether two ECGs originate from the same patient. Our model demonstrates great generalization capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance in gallery-probe patient identification on PTB-XL while utilizing 760x fewer parameters. Furthermore, we present a technique leveraging our model for detection of recording-assignment mistakes, showcasing its applicability in a realistic scenario. Finally, we evaluate our model on a newly collected ECG dataset",

    "translated_abstract": "心电图(ECG)通常被心脏病专家用于检测与心脏相关的病理情况，而可靠的ECG集合对于确诊非常重要。然而，在临床实践中，将记录的ECG分配给错误的患者可能会不经意地发生。本文与一家临床和研究机构合作，该机构认识到这一挑战并联系我们，我们提出了一项研究来解决这个问题。我们提出了一种小巧高效的基于神经网络的模型，用于确定两个ECG是否来自同一患者。我们的模型展现了很强的泛化能力，并在利用760倍更少的参数的情况下，在PTB-XL上实现了最新的画廊探针患者识别表现。此外，我们提出了一种技术，利用我们的模型来检测记录-分配错误，展示了它在一个现实场景中的适用性。最后，我们对新收集的ECG数据集进行了评估。",
