    "translated_abstract": "单细胞RNA测序（scRNA-seq）被广泛用于揭示细胞异质性，这为我们提供了有关细胞间通信，细胞分化和差异基因表达的见解。然而，由于数据稀疏性和涉及的基因数量庞大，分析scRNA-seq数据是一项挑战。因此，降维和特征选择对于消除假信号并增强下游分析非常重要。相关聚类和投影（CCP）是最近引入的一种有效的预处理scRNA-seq数据的方法。CCP利用基因之间的相关性来对基因进行分组，并根据此分组使用细胞之间的相互作用来获取超级基因。由于CCP是一种不需要矩阵对角化的数据域方法，因此它可以用于许多下游机器学习任务。在这项工作中，我们利用CCP作为均匀流形逼近和投影（UMAP）和t分布随机邻域嵌入（t-SNE）的初始化工具来可视化scRNA-seq数据。我们证明，与其他最先进的方法相比，CCP辅助UMAP和t-SNE在细胞类型聚类方面显示出更高的准确性。我们的方法计算效率高，可以处理具有数百万个细胞和数千个基因的数据集。我们的CCP辅助UMAP和t-SNE可以作为许多scRNA-seq应用的预处理工具。",
