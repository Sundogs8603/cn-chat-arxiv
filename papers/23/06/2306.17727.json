    "abstract": "The Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) technique is used to convert natural language queries into executable SQL statements. Typically, slot-filling is employed as a classification method for multi-task cases to achieve this goal. However, slot-filling can result in inaccurate SQL statement generation due to negative migration issues arising from different classification tasks. To overcome this limitation, this study introduces a new approach called Multi-Layer Expert Generate SQL (MLEG-SQL), which utilizes a dedicated multi-task hierarchical network. The lower layer of the network extracts semantic features of natural language statements, while the upper layer builds a specialized expert system for handling specific classification tasks. This hierarchical approach mitigates performance degradation resulting from different task conflicts. The proposed method was evaluated on the WiKSQL dataset and was found to be effective in generating accurate SQL statements.",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言到SQL（NL2SQL）技术用于将自然语言查询转换为可执行的SQL语句。通常，通过插槽填充作为多任务分类方法来实现此目标。然而，由于不同分类任务的负迁移问题，插槽填充可能导致生成不准确的SQL语句。为了克服这个限制，本研究引入了一种名为多层专家生成SQL（MLEG-SQL）的新方法，该方法利用专用的多任务分层网络。网络的下层提取自然语言语句的语义特征，而上层构建一个专门的专家系统来处理特定的分类任务。这种分层方法减轻了不同任务冲突带来的性能下降。该方法在WiKSQL数据集上进行了评估，并证明在生成准确的SQL语句方面是有效的。",
