    "translated_abstract": "模仿学习已经应用于各种机器人任务，但在以下情况下可能会遇到困难：（1）机器人遇到训练数据中没有代表的边缘案例（分布转移）或（2）人类演示是异质的：例如，在障碍物周围采取不同路径（多模态）。交互式车队学习（IFL）通过允许机器人在任务执行过程中访问远程人类远程操作员并从他们那里学习来减轻分布转移问题，但不能处理多模态。最近的研究提出了隐性行为克隆（IBC），它能够使用基于能量的模型（EBMs）表示多模态演示。在这项工作中，我们提出用隐性互动车队学习（IIFL）解决多模态和分布转移问题，这是隐性策略在交互式模仿学习中的第一个扩展（包括单机器人、单人类的设置）。IIFL使用Jeffreys分歧的新颖应用来量化不确定性。",
