We employ a deep learning based automated detector through a three level hierarchical attention network (3HAN) for fast, accurate detection of fake news. 3HAN has three levels, one each for words, sentences, and the headline, and constructs a news vector: an effective representation of an input news article, by processing an article in an hierarchical bottom-up manner. The headline is known to be a distinguishing feature of fake news, and furthermore, relatively few words and sentences in an article are more important than the rest. 3HAN gives a differential importance to parts of an article, on account of its three layers of attention. By experiments on a large real-world data set, we observe the effectiveness of 3HAN with an accuracy of 96.77%.

    "translated_abstract": "虚假新闻的迅速传播是一个需要AI解决方案的严重问题。我们使用基于深度学习的三层分层注意网络（3HAN）构建一个自动检测器，用于快速、准确地检测虚假新闻。 3HAN通过逐层自下而上的方式构建新闻向量：对输入新闻文章的有效表示。在新闻中，标题是虚假新闻的一个区别特征，同时文章中的相对较少的单词和句子比其余部分更为重要。3HAN由于具有三层注意力的机制，给文章的不同部分分配不同的重要性。通过对大型真实数据集的实验，我们观察到了3HAN的高效性，准确率达到了96.77％。与其他深度学习模型不同，3HAN通过对文章不同部分的注意权重提供了可理解的输出结果。",
