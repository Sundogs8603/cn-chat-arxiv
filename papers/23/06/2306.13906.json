    "translated_abstract": "我们评估了生成式预训练转换器（GPT-4）在需要高度专业领域知识的任务中分析文本数据的能力。具体而言，我们专注于分析法院意见以解释法律概念的任务。我们发现，GPT-4在注释指南的提示下与训练有素的法律学生注释者的表现相当。我们观察到，通过批处理预测，可以在相对较小的性能损失下实现成本的显著降低。然而，采用连续思考提示并没有显著提高这项任务的性能。此外，我们演示了如何分析GPT-4的预测结果以识别和减轻注释指南的缺陷，并随后改善模型的性能。最后，我们观察到该模型非常脆弱，因为提示中的小型格式相关更改对预测结果产生了很大的影响。这些发现可以被法律文本分析领域的研究人员和从业者利用，以提高他们工作的效率和准确性。",
