    "translated_abstract": "因果发现方法已经展示了识别表示动态系统的因果时间依赖结构的时序图的能力。然而，它们不包括对估计连接的置信度的测量。本文介绍了一种新的自助聚合（Bagging）和置信度度量方法，它与时间序列因果发现相结合。该方法允许通过在保留时间依赖性的情况下对原始时间序列数据集进行自助重采样来测量由因果发现方法计算出的时序图连接的置信度。除了置信度量，聚合引导图通过多数投票得出最终聚合输出图。在本文中，我们将我们的方法与最先进的基于条件独立性算法PCMCI+相结合。通过广泛的数值实验，我们实验性地展示了Bagged-PCMCI+除了提供连接的置信度度量外，还可以提高因果发现的性能。",
