    "translated_abstract": "可靠的LiDAR全景分割(LPS)，包括语义和实例分割，对于许多机器人应用非常重要，如自动驾驶。本研究提出了一种新的LPS框架PANet，以消除对偏移分支的依赖并提高大物体的性能，这些物体常常被聚类算法过度分割。首先，我们提出了一个非学习的稀疏实例提出（SIP）模块，采用“采样-平移-分组”方案，从原始点云中高效地将物体点直接分组成实例。具体而言，引入平衡的点采样来生成具有更均匀距离分布的稀疏种子点。同时，提出了一种称为“气泡平移”的平移模块，将种子点收缩到聚类中心。然后，利用连接组件标签算法生成实例提案。此外，设计了一个实例聚合模块，以集成可能的碎片实例。",
