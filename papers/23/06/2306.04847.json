    "abstract": "We propose a new approach to constructing a neural network for predicting expectations of stochastic differential equations. The proposed method does not need data sets of inputs and outputs; instead, the information obtained from the time-evolution equations, i.e., the corresponding dual process, is directly compared with the weights in the neural network. As a demonstration, we construct neural networks for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and the noisy van der Pol system. The remarkable feature of learned networks with the proposed method is the accuracy of inputs near the origin. Hence, it would be possible to avoid the overfitting problem because the learned network does not depend on training data sets.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新方法来构建用于预测随机微分方程期望的神经网络。该方法不需要输入和输出数据集；相反，从时间演化方程获得的信息，即相应的双重过程，直接与神经网络中的权重进行比较。作为演示，我们构建了用于Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程和噪声van der Pol系统的神经网络。使用该方法学习的网络的显着特征是在原点附近的输入的准确度。因此，可以避免过度拟合问题，因为学习的网络不依赖于训练数据集。",
