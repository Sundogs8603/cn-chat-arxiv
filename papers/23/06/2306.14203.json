    "abstract": "On December 7, 2020, Ghanaians participated in the polls to determine their president for the next four years. To gain insights from this presidential election, we conducted stance analysis (which is not always equivalent to sentiment analysis) to understand how Twitter, a popular social media platform, reflected the opinions of its users regarding the two main presidential candidates.

    "translated_abstract": "2020年12月7日，加纳人参加投票，确定下一任总统。为了从这次总统选举中获取洞察力，我们进行了立场分析（不总是等同于情感分析），以了解推特这个受欢迎的社交媒体平台如何反映其用户对两位主要总统候选人的意见。我们使用推特API（Tweepy）收集了总共99,356条推文，并对其中的3,090条进行了人工标注，分为三类：反对，中立和支持。然后我们对这些推文进行了预处理。利用两种基于词典的方法（VADER和TextBlob）以及五种基于监督式机器学习的方法（支持向量机（SVM），逻辑回归（LR），多项式朴素贝叶斯（MNB），随机梯度下降（SGD）和随机森林（RF））对结果数据集进行了评估，参考了准确率，精确率，召回率和F1分数等指标。最佳性能由L算法实现。",
