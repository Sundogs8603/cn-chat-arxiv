This paper proposes a deep learning model named Interactive Convolutional Network (ICN) to forecast spatiotemporal travel demand for shared micromobility. The proposed model develops a novel channel dilation method by utilizing multi-dimensional spatial information (i.e., demographics, functionality, and transportation supply) based on travel behavior knowledge for building the deep learning model. We use the convolution operation to process the dilated tensor to simultaneously capture temporal and spatial dependencies.

    "translated_abstract": "准确的共享微移动需求预测对于交通规划和管理至关重要。尽管深度学习模型为处理需求预测问题提供了强大的工具，但是对于高精度时空共享微移动需求的预测研究仍然不足。本文提出了一种名为交互式卷积网络（ICN）的深度学习模型，用于预测共享微移动的时空出行需求。所提出的模型利用旅行行为知识，基于多维空间信息（即人口统计学，功能和交通供给）开发了一种新颖的通道扩张方法来构建深度学习模型。我们使用卷积运算来处理扩张的张量，从而同时捕捉时间和空间依赖关系。基于二叉树结构的架构和交互式卷积，ICN模型提取不同时间分辨率下的特征，然后生成预测。",
