    "translated_abstract": "本文描述和分析了一种基于岛屿的随机动态电压调节（iRDVS）方法，用于防范功率侧信道攻击。我们首先分析了独立电压岛的数量对信噪比和轨迹错位的影响。作为我们对错位的分析的一部分，我们提出了一种新颖的基于无监督机器学习（ML）的攻击，对于具有三个或更少独立电压的系统很有效。我们的结果表明，带有四个电压岛的iRDVS在200k加密跟踪下无法被破解，说明iRDVS可以有效。我们最后通过描述一个12纳米FinFet工艺下的iRDVS测试芯片来结束讲话，其中包括三个变体的AES-256加速器，所有这些加速器均源自同一RTL。这包括一个同步核心，一个没有保护的异步核心，以及一个使用异步逻辑采用iRDVS技术的核心。芯片的实验室测量表明，两个未受保护的变体都失败了。",
