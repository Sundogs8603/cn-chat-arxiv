Data augmentation is an intuitive way to solve this problem. Existing data augmentation methods generate samples by overlapping or recombining data. The distribution of generated samples is limited by original data, because such transformations cannot fully explore the feature space and offer new information.

    "translated_abstract": "目标：癫痫预测对于改善患者生活质量具有重要意义，重点在于区分发作前状态与发作后状态。随着机器学习的发展，癫痫预测方法取得了显著进展。然而，发作前与发作后状态数据之间的严重不平衡仍然是一个巨大的挑战，限制了分类器的性能。数据扩增是解决这个问题的一个直观方法。现有的数据扩增方法通过重叠或重新组合数据来生成样本。由于这些转换无法完全探索特征空间并提供新信息，所以生成的样本分布受到原始数据的限制。由于癫痫脑电图表示在不同发作之间具有差异性，这些生成的样本不能提供足够的多样性以在新的癫痫发作中实现高性能。因此，我们提出了一种使用扩散模型的新型数据增强方法DiffEEG。方法：扩散模型是一种建模数据分布的强大工具，我们使用此模型来对原始脑电图数据进行转换以生成多样性的样本，进而提高分类器的性能。结果：DiffEEG在神经网络和SVM模型上进行的实验表明，它可以有效地提高癫痫预测的性能，超过了现有的数据扩增方法。",
