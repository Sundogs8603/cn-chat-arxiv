    "title": "Elephants and Algorithms: A Review of the Current and Future Role of AI in Elephant Monitoring. (arXiv:2306.13803v1 [cs.AI])",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) present revolutionary opportunities to enhance our understanding of animal behavior and conservation strategies. Using elephants, a crucial species in Africa's protected areas, as our focal point, we delve into the role of AI and ML in their conservation. Given the increasing amounts of data gathered from a variety of sensors like cameras, microphones, geophones, drones, and satellites, the challenge lies in managing and interpreting this vast data. New AI and ML techniques offer solutions to streamline this process, helping us extract vital information that might otherwise be overlooked. This paper focuses on the different AI-driven monitoring methods and their potential for improving elephant conservation. Collaborative efforts between AI experts and ecological researchers are essential in leveraging these innovative technologies for enhanced wildlife conservation, setting a precedent for numerous other species.",
