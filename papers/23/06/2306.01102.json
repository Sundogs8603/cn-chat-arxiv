    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools capable of accomplishing a broad spectrum of tasks. Their abilities span numerous areas, and one area where they have made a significant impact is in the domain of code generation. In this context, we view LLMs as mutation and crossover tools. Meanwhile, Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms are known to discover diverse and robust solutions. By merging the code-generating abilities of LLMs with the diversity and robustness of QD solutions, we introduce LLMatic, a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm. While LLMs struggle to conduct NAS directly through prompts, LLMatic uses a procedural approach, leveraging QD for prompts and network architecture to create diverse and highly performant networks. We test LLMatic on the CIFAR-10 image classification benchmark, demonstrating that it can produce competitive networks with just $2,000$ searches, even without prior knowledge of the benchmark domain or exposure to any previous top-p",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型 (LLMs) 已成为一种强大的工具，可以完成广泛的任务。它们的能力涵盖了许多领域，它们在代码生成领域产生了重大影响。在此情况下，我们将 LLMs 视为变异和交叉工具。同时，多样性优化算法已知可以发现多样性和稳健的解决方案。通过将 LLMs 的代码生成能力与 QD 解决方案的多样性和鲁棒性相结合，我们引入了 LLMatic，一个神经结构搜索 (NAS) 算法。虽然 LLMs 通过提示直接进行 NAS 考验困难，但 LLMatic 利用程序化方法，利用 QD 来进行提示和网络结构，从而创建多样性和高性能网络。我们在 CIFAR-10 图像分类基准测试中测试了 LLMatic，证明它可以在仅进行 2000 次搜索的情况下产生具有竞争力的网络，即使没有该基准领域的先前知识或任何先前的最佳结果的曝光。",
