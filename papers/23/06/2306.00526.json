    "translated_abstract": "基于布局感知多模态预训练模型的预训练-微调范式在文档图像问答方面取得了显著进展。然而，领域预训练和任务微调对于额外的视觉、布局和任务模块阻止了其直接利用现成的指导调优语言基础模型，而这些模型最近在零样本学习方面显示出了良好的潜力。与将语言模型与文档图像问答领域对齐相反，我们将文档图像问答与现成的指导调优语言基础模型对齐，利用其零样本能力。具体而言，我们提出了布局和任务感知的指导提示模型，称为LATIN-Prompt，它包括布局感知的文档内容和任务感知的描述。前者通过适当的空格和换行符从OCR工具中恢复文本片段之间的布局信息。后者确保模型生成符合任务需求的答案。",
