    "translated_abstract": "聚类方法被应用于越来越多涉及更复杂数据集的场景，其中聚类的形状往往是任意的。本文提出了一种新颖的基于路径谷寻找的聚类算法，旨在寻找聚类之间的谷，并单独提取聚类。该算法采用了三个关键技术。首先，采用路径距离（min-max距离）将聚类之间的不规则边界（即密度谷）转换为完美的球形壳。其次，采用适当的密度测量方法$k$-distance来对最小生成树进行调整，从而计算出强健的min-max距离。然后，通过确定谷的中心和半径来寻找转换后的密度谷。通过在距离变换后将聚类包装在球形壳中，使得即使在聚类形状任意的情况下，提取过程也能够高效率地进行。其次，调整后的最小生成树有助于降低数据集噪音和异常值的影响。最后，通过提取球形壳之间的谷，我们可以高精度高效地发现任意形状的聚类。",
