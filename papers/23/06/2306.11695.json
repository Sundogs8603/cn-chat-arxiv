    "translated_abstract": "随着规模的增大，大型语言模型（LLMs）是网络剪枝方法的自然候选对象：这些方法在努力保持性能的同时，丢弃了网络权重的一个子集。然而，现有的方法要么需要重新训练，这对于十亿级别的LLMs来说很少可行，要么需要解决一个依赖二阶信息的权重重构问题，这也可能计算成本很高。在本文中，我们介绍了一种新颖的、简单但有效的剪枝方法，称为Wanda（基于权重和激活的剪枝），旨在对预训练的LLMs引入稀疏性。受到最近对LLMs中出现的大幅特征的发现的启发，我们的方法在每个输出上按照权重和对应的输入激活相乘的最小幅度来剪枝权重。值得注意的是，Wanda不需要重新训练或更新权重，剪枝后的LLM可以直接使用。我们在LLaMA和LLaMA-2上对我们的方法Wanda进行了彻底的评估。",
