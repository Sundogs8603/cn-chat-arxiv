    "abstract": "Scaling text-to-speech to a large and wild dataset has been proven to be highly effective in achieving timbre and speech style generalization, particularly in zero-shot TTS. However, previous works usually encode speech into latent using audio codec and use autoregressive language models or diffusion models to generate it, which ignores the intrinsic nature of speech and may lead to inferior or uncontrollable results. We argue that speech can be decomposed into several attributes (e.g., content, timbre, prosody, and phase) and each of them should be modeled using a module with appropriate inductive biases. From this perspective, we carefully design a novel and large zero-shot TTS system called Mega-TTS, which is trained with large-scale wild data and models different attributes in different ways: 1) Instead of using latent encoded by audio codec as the intermediate feature, we still choose spectrogram as it separates the phase and other attributes very well. Phase can be appropriately ",

    "translated_abstract": "将文本转语音扩展到大规模和混杂的数据集中已被证明在实现音色和语音风格通用性方面非常有效，特别是在零样本TTS中更是如此。然而，先前的工作通常使用音频编解码将语音编码成潜变量，并使用自回归语言模型或扩散模型来生成它，这忽略了语音的内在性质，可能导致结果劣质或不可控制。从这个角度出发，我们认为语音可以分解成几个属性（例如内容，音色，韵律和相位），每个属性都应该使用具有适当归纳偏差的模块进行建模。因此，我们精心设计了一种新的大规模零样本TTS系统Mega-TTS，使用大规模野外数据进行训练，并以不同的方式对不同的属性进行建模：1）我们仍然选择使用频谱图作为中间特征，而不是使用音频编解码编码的潜变量。频谱图非常好地分离了相位和其他属性。相位可以在训练中被适当地忽略，并在推理中添加回来以获得自然的语音。2）我们使用了一个多说话人模型同时建模音色和韵律，并避免过度拟合于特定说话人。3）我们使用了基于transformer的语言模型来模拟内容，它可以受益于现有的预训练技术，并处理文本的长程依赖。实验结果表明，我们的Mega-TTS在语音质量和说话人相似度指标方面显着优于先前的工作。",

    "en_tdlr": "Mega-TTS is a zero-shot TTS system trained on large-scale wild data. It decomposes speech into different attributes and models each of them with a module having appropriate inductive biases. These include using spectrogram as the intermediate feature, a multi-speaker model to model timbre and prosody simultaneously, and a transformer-based language model to model content. Experiments show significant improvement over previous works in speech quality and speaker similarity metrics."
