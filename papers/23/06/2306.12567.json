    "abstract": "This paper investigates whether current large language models exhibit biases in logical reasoning, similar to humans. Specifically, we focus on syllogistic reasoning, a well-studied form of inference in the cognitive science of human deduction. To facilitate our analysis, we introduce a dataset called NeuBAROCO, originally designed for psychological experiments that assess human logical abilities in syllogistic reasoning. The dataset consists of syllogistic inferences in both English and Japanese. We examine three types of biases observed in human syllogistic reasoning: belief biases, conversion errors, and atmosphere effects. Our findings demonstrate that current large language models struggle more with problems involving these three types of biases.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文调查了当前的大型语言模型是否像人类一样在逻辑推理中存在偏见。具体而言，我们关注的是三段论推理，这是人们在推理认知科学中研究过的推理形式。为了方便我们的分析，我们介绍了一个名为 NeuBAROCO 的数据集，最初是为评估人类在三段论推理中的逻辑能力而设计的心理实验。该数据集包括英文和日文的三段论推理。我们研究了人类三段论推理中观察到的三种偏见类型：信念偏见、转化错误和氛围效应。我们的研究结果表明，当前的大型语言模型在涉及这三种类型的问题时更容易出现问题。",
