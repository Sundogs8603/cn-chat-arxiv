These new findings are slow to translate to clinical interventions, leading to poorer patient outcomes and unnecessary deaths.

    "translated_abstract": "虽然新冠病毒的研究在不断增加，但COVID-19大流行导致了美国110万人的死亡。这些新发现在转化为临床干预方案方面缓慢，导致患者预后较差和不必要的死亡。其中一种原因是临床医生因患者过多而难以跟上新冠病毒文献的速度。发展一个使用大型语言模型（LLM）评估冠状病毒文献的工具，即神经网络用于自然语言处理，可能是一个解决方案。LLMs可用于汇总和提取用户指定的信息。较大范围和先进的LLMs和预处理的冠状病毒文献数据库提供了通过冠状病毒文献特定LLM（covLLM）协助临床医生评估冠状病毒文献的机会，该工具直接输入研究文章和用户查询以返回答案。在使用COVID-19开放研究数据集（CORD-19）的过程中，我们开发和评估了covLLM，展示了它在总结和从冠状病毒文献中提取信息方面的实用性。",
