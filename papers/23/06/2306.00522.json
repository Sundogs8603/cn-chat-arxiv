We show that techniques to properly identify the contributions of the different model components in SSNs, however, lead to suboptimal network estimation, slower convergence, and degenerated or erroneous predictions. In order to solve these problems while preserving favorable model properties, we propose a non-invasive post-hoc orthogonalization (PHO) that guarantees identifiability of model components and provides better estimation and prediction quality.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，将结构回归模型与深度神经网络相结合，以获得更好的可解释性、更强的表达力和统计上有效的不确定性量化，展示了半结构化神经网络的多功能性。然而，我们发现在半结构化神经网络中，正确识别不同模型组成部分的技术会导致次优的网络估计，收敛速度变慢，甚至会出现预测失误。为了解决这些问题，同时保持有利的模型特性，我们提出了一种非侵入式的后处理正交化（PHO）方法，旨在保证模型组成部分的识别性，提供更好的估计和预测质量。我们的理论发现得到了数值实验、基准比较以及COVID-19感染的实际应用的支持。",
