    "abstract": "Operationalizing AI fairness at LinkedIn's scale is challenging not only because there are multiple mutually incompatible definitions of fairness but also because determining what is fair depends on the specifics and context of the product where AI is deployed. Moreover, AI practitioners need clarity on what fairness expectations need to be addressed at the AI level. In this paper, we present the evolving AI fairness framework used at LinkedIn to address these three challenges. The framework disentangles AI fairness by separating out equal treatment and equitable product expectations. Rather than imposing a trade-off between these two commonly opposing interpretations of fairness, the framework provides clear guidelines for operationalizing equal AI treatment complemented with a product equity strategy. This paper focuses on the equal AI treatment component of LinkedIn's AI fairness framework, shares the principles that support it, and illustrates their application through a case study",

    "translated_abstract": "针对领英平台上实现规模化的AI公平性不仅具有多个相互冲突的公平定义，而且确定公平性还取决于AI实现的产品的具体细节和背景，这对于AI从业人员的公平性期望值也需要明确。在本文中，我们介绍了领英正在使用的AI公平性框架来应对这三个挑战。该框架通过区分平等对待和公平产品期望，从而分离了AI的公平性。该框架提供了明确的指导方针来操作化实现平等的AI待遇，配合产品平等的策略，而不是在这两种常见的公平性解释之间强制进行权衡。本文重点介绍了领英AI公平性框架中的平等AI待遇组成部分，并分享了支持这些原则的实例。",
