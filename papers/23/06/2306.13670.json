    "abstract": "In recent years, Artificial intelligence products and services have been offered potential users as pilots. The acceptance intention towards artificial intelligence is greatly influenced by the experience with current AI products and services, expectations for AI, and past experiences with ICT technology. This study aims to explore the factors that impact AI acceptance intention and understand the process of its formation. The analysis results of this study reveal that AI experience and past ICT experience affect AI acceptance intention in two ways. Through the direct path, higher AI experience and ICT experience are associated with a greater intention to accept AI. Additionally, there is an indirect path where AI experience and ICT experience contribute to increased expectations for AI, and these expectations, in turn, elevate acceptance intention.

    "translated_title": "什么推动了人工智能技术的接受？期望和经验的作用。",
    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人工智能产品和服务已作为试点向潜在用户提供。当前人工智能产品和服务的经验、对人工智能的期望、以及过去的ICT技术经验都在很大程度上影响着人们接受人工智能的意愿。该研究旨在探究影响人工智能接受意愿的因素，并理解其形成过程。研究结果表明，人工智能经验和过去的ICT经验以两种方式影响人工智能接受意愿。通过直接途径，更高的人工智能经验和ICT经验与更大的接受人工智能的意愿有关。此外，还存在一种间接途径，即人工智能经验和ICT经验有助于增加对人工智能的期望值，而这些期望值反过来提高了接受人工智能的意愿。根据研究结果，为计划实施人工智能的公司和公共组织提出了几项建议。",

    "en_tdlr": "The intention to accept AI is greatly influenced by experience and expectations, with past ICT experience having a significant impact. AI experience and ICT experience impact acceptance intention through both direct and indirect pathways. Expectations for AI also contribute to increased acceptance intention. Companies and public organizations planning to implement AI should consider these factors."
