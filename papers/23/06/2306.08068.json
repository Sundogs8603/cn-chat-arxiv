    "translated_abstract": "最近在三维场景理解方面取得的进展使跨大量不同场景的数据集的可扩展表示学习成为可能。因此，对于未见过的场景和物体的泛化，仅通过单个或少数图像渲染新视图，以及支持编辑的可控场景生成现在成为可能。然而，联合训练大量场景通常会在渲染质量上妥协，而与单个场景优化模型（如NeRF）相比。在本文中，我们利用最近扩散模型的进展，使三维场景表示学习模型具备呈现高保真新视图的能力，同时在较大程度上保留了诸如基于物体的场景编辑之类的优点。特别地，我们提出了DORSal，它基于扩散视频架构，为基于物体中心的场景插槽表示的三维场景生成提供适应性。我们在复杂的合成多物体场景和现实世界大规模街景数据集上证明，我们的模型能够生成高质量的场景新视图，同时支持物体级别的编辑，并保留细粒度的纹理和反射等细节。",
