    "translated_abstract": "网络应用程序常常使用排序模型将最相关的结果排在前面，以呈现给用户有限的选择。通常假定从用户获得的反馈只反映了项目效用的相对评价，例如用户单击项目只暗示它比在同一排序列表中未单击的项目更好。因此，学习排序（LTR）中优化的目标往往是成对或按列表排序。然而，只看到相对反馈，我们忽视了用户对列表整体质量的绝对反馈，例如当选择中没有项目被单击时。因此，我们重新考虑了标准的LTR范式，并论述了从这种列表级信号中学习的好处。为此，我们提出了RankFormer作为一个带有Transformer核心的架构，可以共同优化新的列表评估目标和传统的按列表LTR目标。我们在公共数据集上模拟隐式反馈，并观察到RankFormer比几种最先进的LTR方法表现更好，从而证明了利用列表标签的有效性。",
