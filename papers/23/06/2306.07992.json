    "translated_abstract": "随着富含图片等视觉数据与物品关联度增加，视觉感知推荐系统（VARS）已被广泛应用于不同应用领域。最近的研究表明，VARS易受到物品-图像对抗攻击的攻击，这些攻击向与这些物品关联的干净图像添加人类无法感知的扰动。对VARS的攻击为广泛使用VARS的许多应用（如电子商务和社交网络）带来新的安全挑战。如何保护VARS免受此类对抗攻击成为一个关键的问题。目前，尚缺乏系统地研究如何设计针对VARS视觉攻击的安全防御策略。本文提出了一种对抗图像重构及检测框架来保护VARS，我们的方法可以同时(1)通过基于全局视觉传输的图像重构来防御以局部扰动为特征的对抗攻击，(2)使用在少量干净和对抗性图像上训练的检测模型来检测对抗性图像。实验结果表明，我们的框架能够有效地防御各种物品-图像对抗攻击对VARS的影响。",
