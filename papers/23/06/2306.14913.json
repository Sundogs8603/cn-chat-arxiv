    "translated_abstract": "普适信息抽取（UIE）作为一个统一的框架已经取得了广泛成功，但UIE模型存在一些局限性。例如，在训练过程中，它们过于依赖于数据中的跨度边界，这并不反映跨度注释的真实挑战。微小的位置调整也可以满足要求。此外，UIE模型缺乏对信息抽取中有限的跨度长度特征的关注。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了模糊跨度普适信息抽取（FSUIE）框架。具体而言，我们的贡献包括模糊跨度损失和模糊跨度注意力两个概念。我们在一系列主要的信息抽取任务上的实验结果显示，在数据量和训练轮数较少的情况下，与基准模型相比，FSUIE在快速收敛和强大性能方面取得了显著改进。这些结果证明了FSUIE的有效性和泛化能力。",
