    "translated_abstract": "基于图像的运动预测是机器人操作中必不可少的技术之一。在各种预测模型中，我们将重点放在了扩散模型上，因为它们在各种应用中都取得了最先进的性能。扩散模型通过逐渐去噪图像上下文中的随机高斯噪声，以随机方式预测上下文相关的运动。虽然扩散模型能够通过改变随机噪声预测各种各样的运动，但有时它们不能基于图像上下文预测出恰当的运动，因为随机噪声是独立于图像上下文采样的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了 R2-Diff。在 R2-Diff 中，从基于图像相似度的数据集中检索出一种运动，将其输入到扩散模型而不是随机噪声中。然后，经过扩散模型的去噪流程对检索到的运动进行改进。由于检索到的运动几乎适合于上下文，所以它变得更容易理解。",
