Our methodology consists of grounding spatial-temporal categories in tweet usage trends using time-series analysis and clustering. Salient terms in each category were then identified through qualitative comparative analysis based on scaled f-scores aggregated into hand-coded categories. To exemplify this approach, we conducted a case study on the first wave of the coronavirus in Italy. We used our proposed methodology to explore existing psychological observations which claimed that physical distance from events affects what is communicated about them. We confirmed these findings by showing that the epicentre of the disease and peripheral regions correspond to clear time-series clusters and that",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种方法，通过社交媒体上的语言行为来研究社会对重要事件（例如SARS CoV2大流行期间发生的事件）的反应，特别是空间和时间方面的特征。我们的方法包括使用时间序列分析和聚类技术基于推文使用趋势来确定时空范畴。然后，我们通过定性比较分析，将每个类别中的显著术语鉴定为手工编码类别中基于缩放F分数聚合的术语。为了说明这种方法，我们在意大利新冠疫情的第一波流行中进行了案例研究。我们使用我们提出的方法来探索已有的心理观察结果，即身体距离事件的远近会影响事件相关信息的传播。我们通过展示疾病的震中和外围区域对应于清晰的时间序列聚类来确认这些发现。",

The study uses time-series analysis and clustering to examine tweet usage trends and identifies salient terms in each category through qualitative comparative analysis. The findings confirm that the public's communication about the event is influenced by the physical distance from the epicenter and peripheral regions, supporting existing psychological observations."
