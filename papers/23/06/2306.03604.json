    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)包含从海量文本数据集中获取的大量世界知识。最近的研究表明，LLMs可以通过提供高层指令来协助算法代理解决具有复杂顺序决策的任务。然而，与LLMs进行交互可能耗时较长，因为在许多实际情况下，它们需要大量存储空间，只能部署在远程云服务器节点上。此外，使用商业LLMs可能成本很高，因为它们可能根据使用频率收费。本文探讨如何实现代理与LLM之间的高效和经济有效的互动。我们提出了一种基于强化学习的中介模型，以确定何时需要查询LLMs以完成目标任务的高级指令。在涉及规划子目标的4个MiniGrid环境上进行的实验表明，我们的方法可以学习解决目标任务，并提升了效率和成本效益。",
