    "translated_abstract": "当调查恶意文件时，搜索相关文件是恶意分析员必须执行的常见任务。由于生产恶意软件库可能包含超过十亿个文件并消耗PB级的存储空间，许多特征提取和相似性搜索方法在计算上是不可行的。本文研究了将杀毒扫描数据作为恶意软件的可扩展特征源的潜力。这是可能的，因为AV扫描报告通过VirusTotal等服务广泛可用，并且比平均恶意软件样本小约100倍。 AV扫描报告中的信息充满了丰富的信息，可以指示恶意文件的家族、行为、目标操作系统和许多其他特征。我们介绍了AVScan2Vec，一种语言模型，可以理解AV扫描数据的语义。AVScan2Vec摄取用于恶意文件的AV扫描数据，并输出有意义的向量表示。AVScan2Vec向量比流行的恶意软件特征提取方法小约3到85倍。",
