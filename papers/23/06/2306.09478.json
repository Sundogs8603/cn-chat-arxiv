    "translated_abstract": "由于其使用深度神经网络有效逼近偏微分方程（PDE）的能力，物理感知神经网络（PINN）最近在科学界备受青睐。然而，它们的应用通常被局限于内插场景，其中预测依赖于在训练集支持内的输入。在现实世界的应用中，通常需要外推，但是PINNs的域外行为尚未得到充分研究。在本文中，我们对PINNs的外推行为进行了详细研究，并提供了针对几个先前的假设的证据：我们研究了不同模型选择对外推的影响，并发现一旦模型能够达到零内插误差，进一步增加架构大小或采样点数量对外推行为没有影响。我们还展示了对于一些PDE，PINNs在外推中的表现几乎与内插一样好。通过分析数据的Fourier和Laplace谱，我们提供了对观察到行为的解释。最后，我们提出并评估了不同的策略来减少外推误差，其中最有效的策略涉及修改训练损失函数以强调外推准确性。",
