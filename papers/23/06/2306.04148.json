    "translated_abstract": "获得一种广泛应用的丰富音乐数据集非常重要。目前，可用的数据集主要专注于存储语音或乐器录音数据，并忽略了其视觉表现和检索需求。本文试图构建一个名为SANGEET的基于XML的公共数据集，存储著名音乐学家Pt. Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande创作的北印度古典音乐作品的全面信息。SANGEET以标准化的方式保存了任何给定作品的所需信息，包括元数据、结构、符记、节奏和旋律信息，以便于音乐信息的易于存储和提取。该数据集旨在为音乐信息研究任务提供真实基础信息，因此支持从机器学习视角进行多项数据驱动分析。我们通过演示其在旋律预测任务和歌曲生成任务中的能力，展示了该数据集的实用性。",
