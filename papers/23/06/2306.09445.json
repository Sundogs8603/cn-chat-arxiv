    "translated_abstract": "作为经济学、博弈论和运筹学中的一个统一概念，效用在机器人和人工智能领域中被用来评估个体需求、偏好和利益水平。特别是在多智能体/机器人系统（MAS/MRS）的决策和学习中，合适的效用模型可以指导智能体选择合理的策略来实现其当前需求并学会合作和组织其行为，优化系统的效用，建立稳定可靠的关系，并保证每个群体成员的可持续发展，类似于人类社会。虽然这些系统的复杂、大规模和长期的行为很大程度上由底层关系的基本特性决定，但在机器人和人工智能领域，对机制的理论方面和应用领域的讨论较少。本文引入了一个以效用为导向的需求范式，描述和评估了内部和外部关系。",
