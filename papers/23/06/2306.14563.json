However, these are typically designed for one-step-ahead tasks. On the other hand, the literature regarding the application of dynamic ensembles for multi-step ahead forecasting is scarce. Moreover, it is not clear how the combination rule is applied across the forecasting horizon. We carried out extensive experiments to analyze the application of dynamic ensembles for multi-step forecasting.

Moreover, as the horizon increases, most approaches struggle to outperform a static ensemble that assigns equal weights to all models. The experiments are publicly available in a repository.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了由多输出模型组成的集成在多步预测问题中的应用。动态集成通常用于预测，但是这些方法通常只适用于一步预测任务。与此相对，动态集成在多步预测中的应用文献很少，且不清楚组合规则如何应用于整个预测时段。我们进行了大量实验，以分析动态集成在多步预测中的应用。我们进行了一个实例研究，包含3568个时间序列和一个由30个多输出模型组成的集成。我们发现，基于仲裁和时间窗口的动态集成在平均排名上表现最佳。此外，随着预测时间逐步增加，大多数方法都难以胜过将所有模型分配相等权重的静态集成方法。实验代码已公开在一个代码库中。",
