    "translated_abstract": "时态点过程（TPP）是连续时间中建模异步事件序列的标准数学框架。然而，传统的TPP模型常常受限于强假设，限制了其对复杂真实世界事件动态的捕捉能力。为了克服这一限制，研究人员提出了神经TPP，利用神经网络参数化来提供更灵活和高效的建模。虽然最近的研究表明神经TPP的有效性，但它们通常缺乏统一的设置，依赖不同的基线、数据集和实验配置。这使得难以确定推动预测准确性改进的关键因素，阻碍了研究进展。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了一项全面的大规模实验研究，系统评估了最先进的神经TPP模型的预测准确性。我们的研究涵盖了多个真实世界和合成事件序列数据集。",
