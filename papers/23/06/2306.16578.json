    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一个决策者在每个周期将一个可再生和可分资源分配到多个臂上。这些臂具有未知和随机的奖励，其均值与分配的资源成比例，方差与分配资源的阶数$b$成比例。特别地，如果决策者在一个周期将资源$A_i$分配给臂$i$，那么奖励$Y_i$是$Y_i(A_i)=A_i\\mu_i+A_i^b\\xi_i$，其中$\\mu_i$是未知的均值，噪声$\\xi_i$是独立且子高斯的。当阶数$b$从0到1变化时，该框架平滑地连接了标准的随机多臂赌博机和带有完全反馈的在线学习。我们设计了两种算法，它们实现了$b\\in[0,1]$时的最优有界差和无界差的遗憾界，并展示了在$b=1/2$处的相变。理论结果依赖于我们开发的一种新型浓度不等式，它限制了子高斯随机变量的线性组合。",

The variance of the rewards is proportional to the order of the allocated resource. Two algorithms are designed to achieve optimal regret bounds for different orders, and a phase transition is observed at order 1/2."
