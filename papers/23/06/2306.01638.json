    "abstract": "Equivalence classes of DAGs (represented by CPDAGs) may be too large to provide useful causal information. Here, we address incorporating tiered background knowledge yielding restricted equivalence classes represented by 'tiered MPDAGs'. Tiered knowledge leads to considerable gains in informativeness and computational efficiency: We show that construction of tiered MPDAGs only requires application of Meek's 1st rule, and that tiered MPDAGs (unlike general MPDAGs) are chain graphs with chordal components. This entails simplifications e.g. of determining valid adjustment sets for causal effect estimation. Further, we characterise when one tiered ordering is more informative than another, providing insights into useful aspects of background knowledge.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于等价类的有向无环图（通过CPDAGs表示）可能过于庞大，无法提供有用的因果信息。本文探讨了如何整合分层背景知识来限制等价类，从而得出由“分层MPDAGs”表示的等价类。使用分层知识能够显著提高信息量和计算效率：我们表明，构建分层MPDAGs只需要应用Meek的第一法则，并且分层MPDAG（不同于一般的MPDAG）是具有弦图组成部分的链图。这带来了简化，例如确定用于因果效应估计的有效调整集。此外，我们表征了何时一种分层排序比另一种更具信息量，从而提供了关于背景知识有用的方面的见解。",
