    "abstract": "This paper explores new methods for locating the sources used to write a text, by fine-tuning a variety of language models to rerank candidate sources. After retrieving candidates sources using a baseline BM25 retrieval model, a variety of reranking methods are tested to see how effective they are at the task of source attribution. We conduct experiments on two datasets, English Wikipedia and medieval Arabic historical writing, and employ a variety of retrieval and generation based reranking models. In particular, we seek to understand how the degree of supervision required affects the performance of various reranking models. We find that semisupervised methods can be nearly as effective as fully supervised methods while avoiding potentially costly span-level annotation of the target and source documents.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过微调各种语言模型以重新排序候选源，探索了定位撰写文本所使用的来源的新方法。在使用基准的BM25检索模型检索候选源之后，我们测试了多种重新排序方法，以评估它们在源归属任务中的有效性。我们在两个数据集上进行实验，分别为英文维基百科和中世纪阿拉伯历史文献，并采用了多种基于检索和生成的重新排序模型。特别是，我们试图了解所需监督程度如何影响各种重新排序模型的性能。我们发现，半监督方法在避免对目标和源文档进行潜在昂贵的跨度级注释的同时，几乎可以与完全监督方法一样有效。",
