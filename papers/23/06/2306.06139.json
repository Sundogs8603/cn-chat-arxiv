    "translated_abstract": "加权异常值检测是一种识别数据集中异常或异常数据点的方法，可能由各种因素如人为错误、欺诈或设备故障引起。检测异常值可以揭示有关系统故障、欺诈活动和数据模式的重要信息，帮助专家解决这些异常的根本原因。然而，创建正常数据模式的模型以识别异常值可能由于输入数据的性质、标记数据的可用性以及问题的特定要求而具有挑战性。本文针对特定的大规模数据挖掘领域提出了WePaMaDM-Outlier Detection方法，证明这样的技术是依赖于特定领域并通常针对特定问题制定的。然而，类似的领域可以进行修改以适应解决方案。本研究还研究了数据建模在监控、故障检测和趋势分析中的异常点检测技术的重要性。",
