    "title": "Machine Vision Using Cellphone Camera: A Comparison of deep networks for classifying three challenging denominations of Indian Coins. (arXiv:2306.06084v1 [cs.CV])",
    "abstract": "Indian currency coins come in a variety of denominations. Off all the varieties Rs.1, RS.2, and Rs.5 have similar diameters. Majority of the coin styles in market circulation for denominations of Rs.1 and Rs.2 coins are nearly the same except for numerals on its reverse side. If a coin is resting on its obverse side, the correct denomination is not distinguishable by humans. Therefore, it was hypothesized that a digital image of a coin resting on its either size could be classified into its correct denomination by training a deep neural network model. The digital images were generated by using cheap cell phone cameras. To find the most suitable deep neural network architecture, four were selected based on the preliminary analysis carried out for comparison. The results confirm that two of the four deep neural network models can classify the correct denomination from either side of a coin with an accuracy of 97%.",

    "translated_abstract": "印度货币硬币有多种不同面额。其中1卢比、2卢比和5卢比的硬币直径相似。市面上流通的1卢比和2卢比硬币大多款式相同，只有反面上的数字不同。如果硬币正面朝下，则无法由人类判断其正确的面额。因此，我们提出通过训练深度神经网络模型，利用廉价的手机相机产生的硬币数字图像，来判断正反面的正确面额。通过初步分析，选择了四种最适合的深度神经网络架构进行比较，结果表明其中两种可实现从硬币两侧准确判断正确的面额，准确率为97％。",
