    "abstract": "Matching algorithms are commonly used to predict matches between items in a collection. For example, in 1:1 face verification, a matching algorithm predicts whether two face images depict the same person. Accurately assessing the uncertainty of the error rates of such algorithms can be challenging when data are dependent and error rates are low, two aspects that have been often overlooked in the literature. In this work, we review methods for constructing confidence intervals for error rates in matching tasks such as 1:1 face verification. We derive and examine the statistical properties of these methods and demonstrate how coverage and interval width vary with sample size, error rates, and degree of data dependence using both synthetic and real-world datasets. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for best practices for constructing confidence intervals for error rates in matching tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "匹配算法通常用于预测收集中项目之间的匹配。例如，在1：1的人脸验证中，匹配算法预测两张人脸图像是否描绘同一个人。当数据相关且误差率低时，准确评估此类算法误差率的不确定性可能具有挑战性，这是文献中经常被忽略的两个方面。在本文中，我们回顾了构建1:1人脸验证等匹配任务误差率置信区间的方法。我们推导和检验了这些方法的统计属性，并使用合成和真实世界数据集演示了覆盖率和区间宽度如何随着样本量、误差率和数据相关程度变化。基于我们的发现，我们提供了构建匹配任务误差率置信区间最佳实践的建议。",
