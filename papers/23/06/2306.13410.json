    "translated_abstract": "移动电话，消费机器人和智能家电上使用实时设备持续学习应用程序。这些设备具有有限的处理和内存存储能力，而终身学习则在较长时间内获取数据。因此，终身学习算法必须能够在这些约束下工作，同时提供良好的性能。本研究提出了可解释的终身学习（ExLL）模型，其中包括几个重要特点：1）从稀缺的示例和资源的流数据中单次学习学习；2）自组织原型架构，根据相似性将流数据聚类到可分离的组中，并保护数据以防止灾难性遗忘；3）可解释的架构，将聚类转换为可解释的IF-THEN规则，并根据推理相似和不相似来证明模型预测；以及4）在全局和本地级别进行成对融合的推理，以增强可解释性和性能。",
