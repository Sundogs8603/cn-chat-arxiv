    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱（KGs）包含许多实体-关系-实体三元组，为下游应用提供了丰富的信息。尽管从非结构化文本中提取三元组已经广泛探索，但大部分方法需要大量标注实例。当只有少量标记数据可用时，性能将急剧下降。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了相互指导的少样本学习框架，以进行关系三元组提取（MG-FTE）。具体而言，我们的方法包含一个以实体为导向的关系原型解码器，首先对关系进行分类，以及一个以关系为导向的实体原型解码器，根据分类的关系提取实体。为了连结实体与关系，我们设计了原型层融合模块，以提高实体提取和关系分类的性能。此外，我们还引入了一个新的跨域少样本三元组提取任务。广泛的实验表明，我们的方法在少样本三元组提取任务中优于许多最先进的方法，即使只有少量标记数据可用时，也能取得有竞争力的结果。",
