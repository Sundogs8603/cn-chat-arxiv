    "translated_abstract": "尽管新的科技知识不断增长，但近年来大众媒体仍对突破性创新活动减缓表达了担忧。Park等人的《自然》杂志发表了一篇论文，利用数十年的数据和数百万个观测值，结合一种新的量化指标（CD指数），将科学技术创新分为巩固性和突破性。我们对Park等人的方法和发现提出质疑，主要涉及截断偏差和排除偏差。我们表明，作者报告的1980-2010年间突破性专利减少的88％可以通过他们在1976年之前截断所有反向引用来解释。我们还表明，这种截断偏差因技术类别而异。我们更新了分析至2016年，并考虑到美国专利法的变化，该变化允许除专利授予外还引用专利申请，结果表明突破性专利的下降被严重夸大了。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper challenges the methodology and findings of Park et al.'s study on disruptive innovative activity, showing that truncation bias and exclusion bias greatly influenced the results. The decline in disruptive patents reported by Park et al. can be explained by 88% through the truncation of backward citations before 1976. The updated analysis suggests that the decline in disruptive patents has been greatly exaggerated."
