    "translated_abstract": "桁架布局设计是建筑行业中的一个基本问题，即寻找一个满足所有物理约束条件的轻型桁架布局。生成最优布局是一个具有挑战性的组合优化问题，通过穷举搜索求解可能非常昂贵。将端到端强化学习方法直接应用于桁架布局设计也是不可行的，因为在物理约束条件下只有一个很小的布局空间是有效的，导致强化学习训练的奖励非常稀疏。在本文中，我们开发了AutoTruss，一个两阶段的框架，可以高效地生成轻型和合法的桁架布局。AutoTruss首先采用蒙特卡洛树搜索来发现多样化的合法布局，然后利用强化学习来逐步优化有效的解决方案。我们在2D和3D设置下的流行桁架布局设计测试案例中进行了实验和消融研究。AutoTruss在表现上超过了最佳报道的方法。",
