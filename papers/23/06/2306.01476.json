Most existing literature models a user's propensity to choose novel content or to prefer a more diverse set of recommendations at individual interactions. Hierarchical structure, on the other hand, exists in a user's novelty-seeking intent, which is manifested as a static and intrinsic user preference for seeking novelty along with a dynamic session-based propensity. To this end, we propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning-based method to model the hierarchical user novelty-seeking intent, and to adapt the recommendation policy accordingly based on the extracted user novelty-seeking propensity.

    "translated_abstract": "推荐新颖内容可以通过向用户介绍新的兴趣点来改善用户在推荐平台上的长期体验。然而，用户并不总是想要探索新颖的内容。因此，了解他们的寻求新奇的意图并相应地调整推荐策略是至关重要的。本文提出了一种基于层次强化学习的新方法，用于建模用户的层次新奇寻求意图，并根据提取的用户寻求新奇倾向性来调整推荐策略。我们发现，我们提出的方法在推荐项目的准确性和多样性方面优于现有方法。",
