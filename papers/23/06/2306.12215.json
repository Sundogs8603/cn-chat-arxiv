    "translated_abstract": "预测工程系统的剩余使用寿命（RUL）是预测与健康管理中的重要任务。最近，数据驱动的方法在RUL预测中普及，相比模型驱动的方法不需要工程系统的物理知识。但是，这只是将需要的物理专业知识替换成机器学习（ML）专业知识，而这种专业知识通常也不可得。自动化机器学习（AutoML）承诺自动构建端到端的ML管道，使领域专家而非ML专家能够创建自己的模型。本文介绍了AutoRUL，一种AutoML驱动的端到端方法，用于自动RUL预测。AutoRUL将微调的标准回归方法与高预测能力的集成相结合。通过将所提出的方法用于八个真实世界的和合成数据集，与最先进的手工模型进行比较，我们表明AutoML提供了一种可行的选择。",
