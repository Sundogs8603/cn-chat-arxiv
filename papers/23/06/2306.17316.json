    "abstract": "Triangle fees are a novel fee structure for AMMs, in which marginal fees are decreasing in a trade's size. That decline is proportional to the movement in the AMM's implied price, i.e. for every basis point the trade moves the ratio of assets, the marginal fee declines by a basis point. These fees create incentives that protect against price staleness, while still allowing the AMM to earn meaningful fee revenue. Triangle fees can strictly improve the Pareto frontier of price accuracy versus losses generated by the status quo of constant fee mechanisms.",

    "translated_abstract": "三角形费用是一种新颖的自动做市商（AMM）费用结构，其中边际费用随交易规模减少。这种下降的程度与AMM隐含价格的变动成比例，即交易每移动一个基点，资产比例的边际费用就减少一个基点。这些费用创造了激励措施，防止价格过时，同时仍允许AMM获得有意义的费用收入。三角形费用可以严格改善价格准确性与由恒定费用机制产生的损失之间的帕累托前沿。",
