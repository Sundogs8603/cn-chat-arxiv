    "abstract": "We establish a novel relation between delete-free planning, an important task for the AI Planning community also known as relaxed planning, and logic programming. We show that given a planning problem, all subsets of actions that could be ordered to produce relaxed plans for the problem can be bijectively captured with stable models of a logic program describing the corresponding relaxed planning problem. We also consider the supported model semantics of logic programs, and introduce one causal and one diagnostic encoding of the relaxed planning problem as logic programs, both capturing relaxed plans with their supported models. Our experimental results show that these new encodings can provide major performance gain when computing optimal relaxed plans, with our diagnostic encoding outperforming state-of-the-art approaches to relaxed planning regardless of the given time limit when measured on a wide collection of STRIPS planning benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们建立了一个新颖的删除自由规划与逻辑编程之间的关系，这是AI Planning社区的一个重要任务，也被称为松弛规划。我们展示了对于一个规划问题，所有能够有序地产生该问题松弛计划的行动子集都可以通过描述相应松弛规划问题的逻辑程序的稳定模型进行双射捕获。我们还考虑了逻辑程序的支持模型语义，并引入了松弛规划问题的一个因果编码和一个诊断编码作为逻辑程序，都可以通过它们的支持模型捕获松弛计划。我们的实验结果表明，这些新编码在计算最优松弛计划时可以提供重大性能增益，我们的诊断编码在一系列STRIPS规划基准测试中的表现优于松弛规划的现有方法，无论给定时间限制如何。",
