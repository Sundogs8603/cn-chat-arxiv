    "translated_abstract": "在现代芯片设计中，布局是一个关键步骤，旨在确定芯片画布上电路模块的位置。最近的研究表明，强化学习可以提高芯片布局中的人类性能。然而，这种基于强化学习的方法在训练时间长且在未知的芯片电路中具有较低的转移能力。为了解决这些挑战，我们将芯片布局问题作为一个离线强化学习问题，并提出了ChiPFormer，它可以通过固定的离线数据学习到可转移的布局策略。ChiPFormer具有一些先前的研究所没有的优势。首先，ChiPFormer能够利用离线布局设计在多任务设置中更有效地学习可转移的策略。其次，ChiPFormer能够促进对未知芯片电路的有效微调，将布局运行时间从几小时缩短到几分钟。第三，对32个芯片电路的大量实验证明，ChiPFormer在减少布局时间的同时实现了显著提高的布局质量。",
