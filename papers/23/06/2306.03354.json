    "translated_abstract": "理解自己行为如何影响他人行为是驾驶智能体所需的核心技能。然而，现有技术无法满足智能体发现自己和他人之间因果关系的需求。观察性方法面临着动态环境导致因果关系非稳态化，以及因果交互稀疏的挑战，同时需要在线工作。而干预性方法则因为车辆无法在公共道路上进行实验而不切实际。为了解决因果关系的非稳态问题，我们在事件提取方面重新定义了问题，而之前提到的干预限制可以通过反事实仿真来克服。我们提出了三种变体的反事实因果发现方法，并将其与现有观察性时间因果发现方法在3396个因果样本上进行了评估。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a simulation-based counterfactual causal discovery method to overcome the challenges of non-stationarity and intervention restrictions for discovering causal relationships between agents in driving scenarios. Evaluation on real-world driver behavior demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method."
