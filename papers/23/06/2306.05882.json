    "abstract": "Machine Translation (MT) continues to make significant strides in quality and is increasingly adopted on a larger scale. Consequently, analyses have been redirected to more nuanced aspects, intricate phenomena, as well as potential risks that may arise from the widespread use of MT tools. Along this line, this paper offers a meticulous assessment of three commercial MT systems - Google Translate, DeepL, and Modern MT - with a specific focus on gender translation and bias. For three language pairs (English/Spanish, English/Italian, and English/French), we scrutinize the behavior of such systems at several levels of granularity and on a variety of naturally occurring gender phenomena in translation. Our study takes stock of the current state of online MT tools, by revealing significant discrepancies in the gender translation of the three systems, with each system displaying varying degrees of bias despite their overall translation quality.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器翻译（MT）在质量方面继续取得重大进展，并且正在越来越大规模地被采用。因此，分析已转向更微妙的方面、复杂的现象以及可能从广泛使用MT工具中产生的风险。本文针对三个商业MT系统 - Google Translate、DeepL和Modern MT进行了细致的评估，重点关注性别翻译和偏见。对于三种语言对（英语/西班牙语、英语/意大利语和英语/法语），我们在各种自然语境下的性别现象的多个粒度级别上审查了这些系统的行为。我们的研究考虑了在线MT工具的当前状态，揭示了三个系统性别翻译方面的显着差异，尽管它们的整体翻译质量不错，但是每个系统都表现出不同程度的偏见。",
