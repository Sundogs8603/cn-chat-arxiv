    "translated_abstract": "在许多实际应用中，用于训练和测试的图结构化数据具有不同的分布，例如在高能物理学中，用于训练的模拟数据可能与实验不匹配。图领域自适应（GDA）是一种用于解决这些差异的方法。然而，当前的GDA主要通过对单个图神经网络编码器输出的节点表示的分布进行对齐来工作，这可能会产生次优解。这项工作研究了由图结构或节点属性引起的不同分布偏移的不同影响，并确定了一种名为条件结构偏移（CSS）的新类型偏移，证明了当前的GDA方法无法处理。提出了一种称为结构重加权（StruRW）的新方法，并在合成图、四个基准数据集和新的高能物理学应用中进行了测试。StruRW已经显示出显著的性能。",
