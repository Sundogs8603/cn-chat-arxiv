    "translated_abstract": "使用神经网络解决NP难/完全组合问题是一个挑战性的研究领域，旨在超越传统的近似算法。其长期目标是通过学习仅从训练数据生成更优解来超越手工设计的启发式算法，而旅行商问题(TSP)是经常被这些方法瞄准的一个重要的组合优化问题。然而，目前用于解决TSP的基于神经网络的方法常常忽略了问题固有的“算法”本质。与此相反，设计用于TSP的启发式方法常常利用诸如查找最小生成树之类的成熟算法。在本文中，我们提出利用神经算法推理的最新进展来改进TSP问题的学习。具体来说，我们建议在对TSP实例进行训练之前，在相关算法上对我们的神经模型进行预训练。我们的结果表明，使用这种学习方法可以显著提高TSP问题的解决效率。",
