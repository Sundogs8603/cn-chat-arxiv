    "translated_abstract": "打击虚假信息是当前亟待解决的社会危机之一——大约67%的美国人认为虚假信息会产生大量的不确定性，其中有10%的人有意识地传播虚假信息。证据表明，虚假信息可以操纵民主进程和公众舆论，并在危机期间引起股市动荡、社会恐慌甚至死亡。因此，应及时识别并尽可能缓解虚假信息。然而，由于社交媒体平台每天分享大约32亿张图像和720,000 小时的视频，因此对于多模式虚假信息的可扩展性检测需要高效的事实验证。尽管在文本模式下自动事实验证取得了进展(例如，FEVER, LIAR)，但学术界在多模式事实验证方面缺乏实质性的努力。为了填补这一空白，我们引入了FACTIFY3M数据集，该数据集包含300万个样本，通过多种模式和5W问答提高了事实验证领域的极限。",
