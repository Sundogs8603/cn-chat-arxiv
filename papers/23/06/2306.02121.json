    "translated_abstract": "本研究使用MIMIC-IV数据库作为数据源，研究了动态、高频率、多元时间序列生命体征数据在ICU逗留期间的应用，包括体温、心率、平均血压、呼吸频率和SpO2。比较了各种聚类算法，并选择了一种名为Time2Feat的端到端多元时间序列聚类系统结合K-Means作为最有效的ICU患者聚类方法。在聚类分析中，使用了2008年至2016年期间收治的8,080名患者的数据进行模型开发，使用了2017年至2019年期间收治的2,038名患者的数据进行模型验证。通过分析不同类别之间的临床死亡预后差异，发现了不同亚组之间ICU死亡率和医院死亡率的风险差异。此外，本研究还可视化了生命体征变化的轨迹。这项研究的发现为ICU患者提供了有价值的洞察。",
