    "translated_abstract": "通过规避光学的分辨率限制，相干衍射成像（CDI）和全息拼补技术正逐渐应用于从X射线成像到天文学等科学领域。然而，耗时的迭代相位恢复限制了实时成像的速度。虽然有监督的深度学习方法提高了重建速度，但牺牲了图像质量。此外，这些方法对大量标记训练数据的需求在实验上很繁琐。在这里，我们提出了一种无监督的物理信息神经网络重建方法，PtychoPINN，它在保持深度学习重建的100到1000倍速度提升的同时，通过将衍射正演图与重叠测量的实空间约束相结合，改善了重建质量。特别是，PtychoPINN在泛化能力、准确性（典型的信噪比增加了10 dB）和线性分辨率（2-6倍提升）方面取得了显著进展。这种性能和空间分辨率的结合是一种创新性和贡献。",
