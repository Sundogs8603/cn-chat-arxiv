    "translated_abstract": "强化学习已经在创造机器人任务的健壮策略方面显示出了希望。然而，当代强化学习算法需要大量的数据，通常需要数十亿的环境交互才能训练成功的策略。这需要使用快速和高度可并行化的模拟器。除了速度外，这样的模拟器还需要以可接受的水平模拟机器人的物理和它们与环境的交互，以便将在模拟中学习到的策略转移到现实中。我们提供了QuadSwarm，这是一个快速、可靠的旋翼机模拟器，用于单个和多个机器人的强化学习，可以解决这两个问题。QuadSwarm的快速前向动力学传播与渲染解耦，被设计成高度可并行化，因此吞吐量随着额外的计算呈线性比例增长。它提供了多种面向多机器人的强化学习训练场景，并提供领域随机化以促进开发和模拟到真实世界的转换。",
