    "translated_abstract": "Lifelogs（生活日志）是人们生活经历的描述，这些日志通过结合来自多个数字服务（如在线照片、地图、购物和内容流媒体服务）的数据来创建。问答技术在生活日志上的应用可以为个人助手在提供上下文方面提供关键资源。但是，由于生活日志结合了自由文本与一定程度的结构，如时间和地理信息，因此当前的问答技术无法回答此类问题。为此，我们创建并公开发布了TimelineQA，这是一个用于查询生活日志的加速进展的基准测试。TimelineQA生成虚构人物的生活日志。生活日志中的事件从高中毕业等重大生活事件到日常活动如慢跑都有所覆盖。我们进行了一系列关于TimelineQA的实验，使用了两种最先进的模型，发现这两种模型在这一任务上均未达到人类表现水平。",
