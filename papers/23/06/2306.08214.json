    "abstract": "Adjustments to public health policy are common. This paper investigates the impact of COVID-19 policy ambiguity on specific groups' insurance consumption. The results show that sensitive groups' willingness to pay (WTP) for insurance is 12.2% above the benchmark. Groups that have experienced income disruptions are more likely to suffer this. This paper offers fresh perspectives on the effects of pandemic control shifts.",
