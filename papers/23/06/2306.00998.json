    "abstract": "This paper presents a method for selecting appropriate synthetic speech samples from a given large text-to-speech (TTS) dataset as supplementary training data for an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. We trained a neural network, which can be optimised using cross-entropy loss or Arcface loss, to measure the similarity of a synthetic data to real speech. We found that incorporating synthetic samples with considerable dissimilarity to real speech, owing in part to lexical differences, into ASR training is crucial for boosting recognition performance. Experimental results on Librispeech test sets indicate that, in order to maintain the same speech recognition accuracy as when using all TTS data, our proposed solution can reduce the size of the TTS data down below its $30\\,\\%$, which is superior to several baseline methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种方法，用于从给定的大规模文本转语音（TTS）数据集中选择适当的合成语音样本，作为自动语音识别（ASR）模型的补充训练数据。我们训练了一种神经网络，可以使用交叉熵损失或 Arcface 损失进行优化，来衡量合成数据与真实语音的相似度。我们发现，将具有相当差异的合成样本（部分原因是由于词汇差异）纳入 ASR 训练对于提高识别性能至关重要。在 Librispeech 测试集上进行的实验结果表明，为了保持与使用所有 TTS 数据时相同的语音识别精度，我们提出的解决方案可以将 TTS 数据的大小减少至其 30％ 以下，这比几种基准方法都要优秀。",

Experimental results suggest that incorporating substantially different synthetic samples into ASR training is critical for improved recognition performance and our proposed solution can reduce the size of TTS data to under 30% while maintaining accuracy, outperforming baseline methods."
