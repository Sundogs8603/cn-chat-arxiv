    "translated_abstract": "近期神经声码器的发展主要由在时域中操作的生成对抗网络（GAN）推动。虽然有效，但这种方法忽视了时频表示提供的归纳偏差，从而导致冗余和计算密集的上采样操作。基于傅里叶变换的时频表示是一个有吸引力的替代方案，它与人的听觉感知更加准确，并且通过其计算得到了经过充分验证的快速算法的好处。然而，直接重建复值谱图在历史上一直存在问题，主要是由于相位恢复问题。本研究旨在通过提出Vocos，一个直接生成傅里叶谱系数的新模型，来消除这个差距。我们的评估结果表明，Vocos不仅与音频质量的最新技术水平相匹配，而且在计算效率上实现了数量级的提升，与传统方法相比速度提高了一个数量级。",
