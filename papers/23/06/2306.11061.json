    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于神经网络的随机波动率模型校准方法，该方法将Horvath等人（2021）的网格方法与Bayer和Stemper（2018）的点对点两步校准相结合。我们的方法继承了前者的鲁棒性，而不会受到插值/外推技术的需要所困扰，这是点对点方法的明显优势。整个程序的关键在于在随机格上生成含隐含波动率面，将其在训练阶段提供给网络。我们通过对粗糙Bergomi和Heston模型进行几个经验和蒙特卡罗实验来支持我们的校准技术的有效性，这些实验采用了简单而有效的正向方差曲线参数化。该方法为金融工程学中的有价值的应用（例如，在本地随机波动率模型下的定价）以及路径相关领域的快速扩展铺平了道路。",
