    "abstract": "Subject clustering (i.e., the use of measured features to cluster subjects, such as patients or cells, into multiple groups) is a problem of great interest. In recent years, many approaches were proposed, among which unsupervised deep learning (UDL) has received a great deal of attention. Two interesting questions are (a) how to combine the strengths of UDL and other approaches, and (b) how these approaches compare to one other.  We combine Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), a popular UDL approach, with the recent idea of Influential Feature PCA (IF-PCA), and propose IF-VAE as a new method for subject clustering. We study IF-VAE and compare it with several other methods (including IF-PCA, VAE, Seurat, and SC3) on $10$ gene microarray data sets and $8$ single-cell RNA-seq data sets. We find that IF-VAE significantly improves over VAE, but still underperforms IF-PCA. We also find that IF-PCA is quite competitive, which slightly outperforms Seurat and SC3 over the $8$ single-cell data sets. ",
