    "translated_abstract": "近期文献提出了新颖方法来快速评估单光子源（SPS）的质量，例如量子点，以解决实验验证通过光强干涉仪验证效率低和耗时长的问题。然而，由于缺乏不确定性讨论和可重复性细节，这些方法的可靠性引发了关切。本研究对从发射波长为1.3μm，由80MHz激光器激发的InGaAs/GaAs外延量子点获得的八组数据进行了研究。该研究通过采用数据增强的机器学习技术，将实验数据与自举样本相结合，引入了一种新颖的贡献。对合成样本的高效直方图拟合导出的SPS质量指标，即多光子发射事件的概率进行分析，揭示了由描述探测率的泊松过程中随机变异性贡献的显著不确定性。忽视这个因素可能导致对SPS质量的错误评估。",
