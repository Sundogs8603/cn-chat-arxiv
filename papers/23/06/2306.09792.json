    "abstract": "This work proposes a Physics-informed Neural Network framework with Graph Embedding (GPINN) to perform PINN in graph, i.e. topological space instead of traditional Euclidean space, for improved problem-solving efficiency. The method integrates topological data into the neural network's computations, which significantly boosts the performance of the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). The graph embedding technique infuses extra dimensions into the input space to encapsulate the spatial characteristics of a graph while preserving the properties of the original space. The selection of these extra dimensions is guided by the Fiedler vector, offering an optimised pathologic notation of the graph. Two case studies are conducted, which demonstrate significant improvement in the performance of GPINN in comparison to traditional PINN, particularly in its superior ability to capture physical features of the solution.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出一种带有图嵌入的物理信息神经网络框架（GPINN），用于在图形结构中执行物理信息神经网络（PINN）。该方法将拓扑数据融入到神经网络的计算中，从而显著提高了 PINN 的性能。图嵌入技术在输入空间中注入了额外的维度，以封装图的空间特征并保留原始空间的属性。这些额外的维度的选择由 Fiedler 向量引导，提供了图的最优异路径符号。进行了两个案例研究，结果显示 GPINN 在性能上相比传统的 PINN 有了显著提升，特别是在捕捉解的物理特征方面更具优势。",

It utilizes graph embedding to inject extra dimensions into the input space to encapsulate the spatial characteristics of a graph while retaining the properties of the original space. GPINN outperforms traditional PINN, particularly in capturing physical features of the solution, as demonstrated in two case studies."
