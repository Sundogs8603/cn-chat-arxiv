    "translated_abstract": "最近，文本摘要的研究主要集中在新闻领域，其中文本通常很短并具有强烈的布局特征。全书摘要的任务提出了额外的挑战，这些挑战很难通过当前的资源来处理，因为它们的规模有限且仅在英语中提供。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了\"Echoes from Alexandria\"（或简称为\"Echoes\"），这是一个用于多语全书摘要的大型资源。Echoes包括三个新颖的数据集：i) Echo-Wiki，用于多语全书摘要；ii）Echo-XSum，用于极度压缩的多语全书摘要；iii）Echo-FairySum，用于抽取式全书摘要。据我们所知，Echoes是最大的资源，也是第一个多语言资源，包括5种语言和25种语言对。除了Echoes，我们还介绍了一个新的抽取-概括基线，并根据我们使用Echoes的经验，确定了全书摘要研究的有前途的未来方向。",
