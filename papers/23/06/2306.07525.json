To address this, specialized pedestrian behavior algorithms are needed. Current research focuses on realistic trajectories using social force models and reinforcement learning based models. However, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm that specifically targets collisions and better uncovers unique failure modes of automated vehicle controllers. Our algorithm is efficient and generates more severe collisions, allowing for the identification and correction of weaknesses in autonomous driving algorithms in complex and varied scenarios.",
