    "translated_abstract": "传统的行人模拟器是建筑设计过程中不可或缺的工具，它们使项目工程师能够预防拥挤情况并规划疏散途径。然而，模拟运行时间和生成模拟结果的多个繁琐步骤可能成为建筑设计过程中的瓶颈。数据驱动方法已经展示了在速度上超越传统方法并在许多领域中提供类似甚至更好结果的能力。在这项工作中，我们基于Vision Transformer提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，用于从给定的平面图预测随时间变化的密度热力图和总疏散时间。具体而言，由于公共数据集的有限可用性，我们实现了一个参数化数据生成流水线，其中包括一个传统的模拟器。这使我们能够构建一个大型的合成数据集，用于训练我们的架构。此外，我们无缝地将我们的模型集成到B系统中。",
