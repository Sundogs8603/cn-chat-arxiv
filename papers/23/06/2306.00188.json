    "translated_abstract": "深度强化学习（DRL）在医学影像领域的应用越来越多。然而，由于成像方向、成像序列和病理学的变化，医学影像任务的环境不断演变。因此，我们开发了一种生命周期DRL框架SERIL，采用基于选择性体验回放的生命周期学习技术，在24个不同的成像环境中进行人脑MRI上五个解剖标志的定位。与两个基准设置MERT（多环境最佳情况）和SERT（单环境最劣情况）相比，SERIL表现出了出色的性能，在所有120个任务中，与期望的标志距离的平均距离为$9.90\\pm7.35$像素，而MERT和SERT分别为$10.29\\pm9.07$和$36.37\\pm22.41$($p<0.05$)，展示了在不断变化的成像环境中持续学习的出色潜力。",
