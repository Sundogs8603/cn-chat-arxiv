    "translated_abstract": "恶意服务器攻击已经使得联邦学习中的数据窃取在大批量和安全聚合等之前被视为私密的设置中变得可行。然而，许多关于恶意服务器攻击客户端侦测性的疑虑被提出，这使得它们在被公开知晓后的实用性受到质疑。在本研究中，我们首次全面研究了客户端侦测的问题。我们证明了许多基于两个关键原则的恶意服务器攻击都可以通过合理的客户端检查来检测出来。此外，我们制定了实用恶意服务器攻击的理想要求，并提出了SEER攻击框架，它满足所有理想要求，可以从现实网络的梯度中窃取用户数据，即使是在大批量(我们的实验中最大可达512)和安全聚合的情况下。SEER攻击的关键是使用秘密解码器，在共享模型上进行联合训练。我们的工作是迈向实用恶意服务器攻击的有前途的第一步。",
