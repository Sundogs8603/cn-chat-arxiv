    "translated_abstract": "语义感知通信是一种新的范式，受到人类通信的启发，专注于传递信息的含义。由于其提高通信效率和可靠性，增强用户体验的潜力，近年来引起了极大的关注。现有的大部分工作都集中在传输和传递可以直接从源信号中识别的显式语义含义。本文研究了隐式语义感知通信，其中不能直接从源信号中观察到的隐藏信息必须由预期的用户识别和解释。为此，提出了一种新颖的隐式语义感知通信（iSAC）架构，用于在源用户和目标用户之间表示、通信和解释隐式语义含义。提出了一种基于投影的语义编码器，将显式语义的高维图形表示转换为低维的语义表示，以更好地描述隐含的语义含义。",

It utilizes a projection-based semantic encoder to convert explicit semantics into a lower-dimensional representation for better describing implicit semantic meaning."
