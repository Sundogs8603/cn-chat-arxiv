    "translated_abstract": "学习解缠绕的因果表示是一个具有挑战性的问题，近年来因其对提取下游任务的有意义信息而引起了广泛关注。本文从独立因果机制的角度定义了一种新的因果解缠绕概念。我们提出了ICM-VAE框架，通过因因果关系观察标签来监督学习因果解缠绕表示。我们使用可学习的基于流的微分同胚函数将噪声变量映射到潜在因果变量中来建模因果机制。此外，为了促进因果要素的解缠绕，我们提出了一种因果解缠绕先验，利用已知的因果结构来鼓励在潜在空间中学习因果分解分布。在相对温和的条件下，我们提供了理论结果，显示了因果要素和机制的可识别性，直到排列和逐元重参数化的限度。我们进行了实证研究...",
