    "translated_abstract": "生物学数据可以分为原始数据（如基因表达）和二级数据（如通路和蛋白质相互作用）。利用二级数据来增强对原始数据的分析的方法很有前景，因为二级数据包含了原始数据中不包含的背景信息。在本研究中，我们提出了一种端到端框架，能够全面处理二级数据，为原始数据构建分类模型。我们将这个框架应用于使用基因表达数据和生物网络的癌症预后预测中。交叉验证结果显示，与不包含背景生物网络信息的深度神经网络模型相比，我们的模型实现了更高的准确性。对癌症类型进行的病人分组实验显示了许多组的ROC曲线下面积的改善。准确性较高的癌症类型的可视化通过富集分析鉴定了贡献基因和通路。已知生物标志物和新的生物标志物。",
