    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了两种新型的渐近保持的卷积Deep Operator网络（APCONs），旨在解决多尺度时变线性输运问题。我们观察到，使用修改过的多层感知器（MLP）的基本物理约束DeepONets可能在保持期望的宏观行为上表现出不稳定性。因此，需要使用渐近保持的损失函数。受扩散方程中的热核的启发，我们提出了一种新的架构，称为卷积Deep Operator网络，它在每个滤波器层中采用多个局部卷积操作而不是全局热核，并结合池化和激活操作。我们的APCON方法的参数数量与网格大小无关，并能够捕捉线性输运问题的扩散行为。最后，通过几个数值实例验证了我们方法的有效性。",
