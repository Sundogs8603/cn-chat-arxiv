    "translated_abstract": "许多科学和工业应用需要同时优化多个潜在的相互冲突的目标。多目标贝叶斯优化 (MOBO) 是一种高效地识别 Pareto 最优解的框架。我们展示了无支配解和最高多元等级之间的自然联系，它与联合累积分布函数的最外层等高线重合。我们提出了 CDF indicator，这是一种 Pareto 合规的度量，用于评估近似 Pareto 集合的质量，它补充了流行的 hypervolume indicator。MOBO 的核心是采集函数，它通过导航目标之间的最佳折中来确定下一个要评估的候选项。 基于盒子分解目标空间的多目标采集函数（例如期望的 hypervolume 改进（EHVI）和熵搜索）在存在大量目标时的性能缩放很差。我们提出一种采集函数，称为 BOtied，它利用相关多元等级来高效搜索 Pareto frontier。我们的实验表明，BOtied 在样本效率和近似质量方面优于现有方法。",
