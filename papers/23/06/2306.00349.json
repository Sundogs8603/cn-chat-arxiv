    "translated_abstract": "在自动驾驶系统领域，感知是至关重要的，其中基于鸟瞰图（BEV）的架构最近已达到最先进的性能。自我监督表示学习的可取性源于注释2D和3D数据的昂贵和费力过程。尽管以前的研究已经研究了LiDAR和基于相机的3D物体检测的预训练方法，但缺少多模式BEV感知的统一预训练框架。在本研究中，我们介绍了CALICO，这是一个新颖的框架，它将对比目标应用于LiDAR和相机骨干。具体而言，CALICO包括两个阶段：点区域对比（PRC）和区域感知蒸馏（RAD）。PRC更好地平衡了对LiDAR模态的区域和场景级表示学习，并与现有方法相比提供了显着的性能改进。RAD有效地在我们的自我训练教师模型上实现了对比蒸馏。CALICO的高效和有效的预训练技术与以前的方法相比，在BEV感知任务中提供了显着的收益。",
