    "translated_abstract": "研究发现，流行的文本，图像和音频数据集中存在标签错误，这严重影响了机器学习算法的开发和评估的可靠性。尽管针对通用数据类型（如图像和文本）的质量改进工作有所增加，但在图数据中检测错误标注的问题仍然未被充分探讨。该论文旨在探索流行的实际图数据集中的错误标注问题，并提出了GraphCleaner，一种后期方法，用于检测和纠正这些图数据集中的错误标注节点。GraphCleaner结合了两种新颖的思想：1）合成错误标注数据集的生成，旨在生成逼真的错误标注；2）邻域感知错误标注检测，其中利用了标签和基分类器预测中的邻域依赖性。在6个基准数据集和6个实验设置上的实证评估表明，GraphCleaner优于最接近的基准线，并具有平均F1得分改进0.14。",
