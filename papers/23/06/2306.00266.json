    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种用于匹配两个相关的Erdős-Rényi图表的有效算法，它们具有 $n$ 个顶点，其边缘通过潜在的顶点对应关系相互关联。当边缘密度 $q=n^{-\\alpha+o(1)}$，对于一个常数 $\\alpha \\in [0,1)$ 时，我们展示了我们的算法具有多项式运行时间，并且只要边缘相关性非零，就能成功恢复潜在匹配。这与我们先前关于匹配两个具有非零相关性的高斯Wigner矩阵的多项式时间算法的工作密切相关，并且在边缘相关性低于Otter常数的平方根（约为0.338）时，提供了第一个多项式时间随机图匹配算法（无论 $q$ 的范围如何）。",
