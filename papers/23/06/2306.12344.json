    "translated_abstract": "解决线性分类问题的算法具有悠久的历史，至少可以追溯到1936年的线性判别分析。对于线性可分数据，许多算法可以有效地得到相应的0-1损失分类问题的精确解，但对于非线性可分数据，已经证明这个问题在完全范围内是NP难的。所有替代方法都涉及某种形式的近似，包括使用0-1损失的代理（例如hinge或logistic损失）或近似的组合搜索，这些都不能保证完全解决问题。找到解决定维度0-1损失线性分类问题的全局最优解的有效算法仍然是一个未解决的问题。在本研究中，我们详细介绍了一个新算法的构建过程，增量单元枚举（ICE），它可以精确解决0-1损失分类问题。",
