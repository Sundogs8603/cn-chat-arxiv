    "translated_title": "结果控制的因果公平性",
    "translated_abstract": "随着社会向基于人工智能的决策基础设施的过渡，越来越多的曾由人类控制的决策现在被委托给了自动化系统。尽管这样的发展使社会的各个方面更有效率，但大量的证据表明，需要非常小心地使这种自动化决策系统变得公平和公正，即考虑到诸如性别、种族和宗教等敏感属性。本文研究了一种特定的决策任务，称为结果控制，其中自动化系统旨在优化一个结果变量Y，同时保持公平和公正。对于这样一个设置的兴趣范围从与刑事司法和福利有关的干预措施，一直到临床决策和公共卫生。我们通过因果镜片首先分析了利益的概念，该概念捕捉了一个特定个体从积极决策中获得了多少好处，对照事实的公平性，捕捉了如果涉及到不同的敏感属性，问题所在，以及充分性的概念，它捕捉了需要多少干预来改善因果系统。然后，我们介绍了一组因果工具和技术来推断结果控制中的公平性。我们通过算法公平性的案例研究展示了我们的方法的有用性，其中我们控制了贷款决策过程中的不公平歧视。",
