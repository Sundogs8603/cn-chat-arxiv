    "translated_abstract": "在大型图上学习表示是一个长期存在的挑战，因为其中涉及了大量数据点之间的相互依赖关系。Transformer作为一种新兴的用于图结构数据的基本编码器类别，由于其全局注意力可以捕捉到邻节点之外的所有对影响，因此在小型图上表现出了有希望的性能。尽管如此，现有方法往往继承了Transformer在语言和视觉任务中的思想，并通过堆叠深层多头注意力来采用复杂的模型。本文通过关于节点属性预测基准的实验证明，即使只使用一层注意力也能在节点数量从千级到十亿级的范围内带来令人惊讶的竞争性能。这鼓励我们重新思考在大型图上设计Transformer的理念，其中全局注意力是一个阻碍可扩展性的计算开销。我们将提出的方案称为简化图Transformer。",
