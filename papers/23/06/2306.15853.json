    "abstract": "In the field of computer vision-driven ice hockey analytics, one of the most challenging and least studied tasks is goalie pose estimation. Unlike general human pose estimation, goalie pose estimation is much more complex as it involves not only the detection of keypoints corresponding to the joints of the goalie concealed under thick padding and mask, but also a large number of non-human keypoints corresponding to the large leg pads and gloves worn, the stick, as well as the hockey net. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GoalieNet, a multi-stage deep neural network for jointly estimating the pose of the goalie, their equipment, and the net. Experimental results using NHL benchmark data demonstrate that the proposed GoalieNet can achieve an average of 84\\% accuracy across all keypoints, where 22 out of 29 keypoints are detected with more than 80\\% accuracy. This indicates that such a joint pose estimation approach can be a promising research direction.",

    "translated_abstract": "在计算机视觉驱动的冰球分析领域中，最具挑战性且研究最少的任务之一是守门员姿势推测。与一般的人体姿势推测不同，守门员姿势推测更加复杂，它不仅涉及检测隐藏在厚厚内衬和面具下的守门员关键点，还涉及大量与守门员身穿的厚重护腿和手套、球棒以及冰球网相关的非人类关键点。为了解决这个挑战，我们引入了GoalieNet，这是一个用于联合推测守门员姿势、守门员装备和球网的多阶段深度神经网络。通过使用NHL基准数据进行实验，结果表明，所提出的GoalieNet可以在所有关键点上实现84%的平均准确率，其中有22个关键点的准确率超过80%。这表明，这种联合姿势推测方法可能是一个有前途的研究方向。",
