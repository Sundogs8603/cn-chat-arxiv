    "translated_abstract": "分子属性预测是药物研发和材料科学中的重要问题。由于分子的几何结构对于分子属性预测的必要性已经被证明，因此将3D信息与各种图形学习方法相结合以提高预测性能。然而，由于高计算成本，在许多现实应用中获得分子的几何结构是不可行的。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的3D预训练框架（称为3D PGT），它在3D分子图上预训练模型，然后在没有3D结构的分子图上进行微调。基于化学键长，化学键角和二面角这三个基本几何描述符对应于完整的分子3D构形，我们首先开发了一个基于这三个属性的多任务生成预训练框架。接下来，为了自动融合这三项生成任务，我们设计了一种使用“总能量”来搜索的替代指标。",
