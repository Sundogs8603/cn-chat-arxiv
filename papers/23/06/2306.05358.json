    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶车辆遭受恶意攻击的担忧日益增加。其中，听不见的语音指令攻击构成了重大威胁，因为语音指令已经在自动驾驶系统中得到了应用。如何通过实证研究来抵御这些听不见的攻击仍然是一个未解决的问题。以往的研究探讨运用基于深度学习的多模态融合来进行防御，却没有考虑模型可信度的不确定性。随着深度学习应用于越来越敏感的任务，不确定性测量在帮助提高模型稳健性方面尤为重要，特别是在关键任务场景中。本文提出了多模态融合框架（MFF）作为智能安全系统来防范听不见的语音指令攻击。MFF利用VGG系列神经网络融合异构音频-视觉模态，并在比较融合方法的实证研究中实现了92.25%的检测准确率。此外，对MFF进行了大量实验，以证明其在不同模型不确定性条件下的可靠性。",
