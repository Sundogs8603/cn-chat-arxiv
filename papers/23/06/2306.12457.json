    "translated_abstract": "目的：COVID-19已经全球蔓延并对整个世界产生了巨大的影响。模拟COVID-19传播状况对了解当前状态和制定干预措施至关重要。基于SEIR模型的流行病学方程模拟疾病的发展。传统的参数估计方法不能精确地拟合真实世界的数据，可能由于不同的情况，如社交距离政策和干预策略等。此外，基于学习的模型可以实现出色的拟合性能，但无法可视化机制。方法：因此，我们提出了一种深度动态流行病学（DDE）方法，将流行病学方程和深度学习优势相结合，以获得高精度和可视化。 DDE包含深度网络以适应效应函数，以基于神经ODE方法解决变量方程来模拟不断变化的情况，确保拟合性能",
