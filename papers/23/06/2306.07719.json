    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱补全旨在通过从已知三元组中预测缺失链接来解决知识图谱(KGs)的不完整性，已经有许多知识图嵌入(KGE)模型来执行KGC。尽管如此，大多数现有的嵌入模型将每个关系映射到一个唯一的向量，忽略了它们在不同实体下的具体细粒度语义。此外，少量可用的细粒度语义模型依靠聚类算法，由于繁琐的二阶段训练过程，导致了有限的性能和适用性。本文提出了一种利用上下文词典查找的新方法，使传统的嵌入模型能够以端到端的方式学习关系的细粒度语义。更具体地，我们使用包含多个潜在语义的词典来表示每个关系。给定实体与词典的中心语义的组合用作词典查找层的上下文，该层返回给定实体下关系的具体语义。我们使用与现有嵌入模型兼容的模块化设计集成这个层，证明了我们方法在四个基准数据集上的有效性。我们的方法在所有四个数据集上均取得了最先进或有竞争力的结果，并具有更简单和可解释的模型结构。",
