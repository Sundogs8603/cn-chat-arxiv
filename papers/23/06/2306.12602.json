    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了初次公开发行（IPO）回报的两个经验事实背后的潜在机制。通过分析在StockTwits和Twitter上表达的投资者情绪，发现这些社交媒体平台传达的情感可以帮助解释IPO股票的错价。社交媒体上分享的大量信息和观点可能会引发对某些股票的炒作，导致投资者的非理性买卖决策。这可能导致股票在短期内被高估，但常常会在长期内得到修正，因为股票的表现未能满足过高的期望。特别是，发现在上市前投资者热情高涨的IPO，其第一天回报率明显更高，为29.54％，而上市前投资者热情较低的IPO，其平均第一天回报率为16.91％。但是，这种初始热情可能是错放的，因为上市前投资者热情很高的IPO可能需要更长的时间才能实现可持续的成长。",
