    "translated_abstract": "特征可视化在Olah等人2017年的有影响力的工作之后获得了很大的 popularity，将其确立为可解释性的重要工具。然而，由于依赖于生成可解释图像的技巧以及在将其扩展到更深的神经网络时面临的挑战，其广泛应用受到了限制。在这里，我们描述了一种简单的方法MACO来解决这些问题。主要思想是通过优化相位谱生成图像，同时保持幅度恒定，以确保生成的解释位于自然图像空间中。我们的方法在定性和定量上都取得了显着的改进，并为大型最先进神经网络提供了高效且可解释的特征可视化。我们还展示了我们的方法具有一个属性机制，可以增强特征可视化的空间重要性。我们在一个新的基准测试中验证了我们的方法。",
