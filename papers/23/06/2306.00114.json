    "translated_abstract": "利用遥感监测土地覆盖是研究环境变化和通过粮食产量预测确保全球粮食安全的关键。尤其是，多时相遥感影像提供了关于场景动态的相关信息，已经被证明可以带来更好的土地覆盖分类结果。然而，由于难以获取可靠、细粒度和高质量的注释样本支持他们的假设，很少有研究受益于高空间和时间分辨率数据。因此，我们介绍了一个加拿大农田的时间补丁数据集，其中包含了来自10个农作物类别的78,536个手动经过确认和筛选的高分辨率(10米/像素，640 x 640米)地理参考图像，覆盖了四个农作物生产年度(2017-2020)和五个月份(六月-十月)。每个实例都包含12个光谱波段、一张RGB图像和额外的植被指数计算。",
