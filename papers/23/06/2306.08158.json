    "abstract": "Deep neural networks often learn unintended biases during training, which might have harmful effects when deployed in real-world settings. This paper surveys 209 papers on bias in NLP models, most of which address sociodemographic bias. To better understand the distinction between bias and real-world harm, we turn to ideas from psychology and behavioral economics to propose a definition for sociodemographic bias. We identify three main categories of NLP bias research: types of bias, quantifying bias, and debiasing. We conclude that current approaches on quantifying bias face reliability issues, that many of the bias metrics do not relate to real-world biases, and that current debiasing techniques are superficial and hide bias rather than removing it. Finally, we provide recommendations for future work.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在训练过程中往往会学习到非预期的偏见，这在实际应用中可能会产生有害的影响。本文对209篇关于NLP模型中偏见的论文进行了调查，其中大部分论文涉及社会人口统计偏见。为了更好地理解偏见与真实世界的危害之间的区别，我们借鉴心理学和行为经济学的思想，提出了社会人口统计偏见的定义。我们确定了NLP偏见研究的三个主要类别：偏见类型、量化偏见和去偏见。我们认为当前对于量化偏见的方法存在可靠性问题，许多偏见度量并不涉及真实世界中的偏见，当前的去偏见技术是表面的，只是隐藏了偏见，而不是真正去除它。最后，我们提供了未来工作的建议。",
