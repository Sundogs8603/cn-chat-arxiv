    "translated_abstract": "在诸如分面导航和推荐系统等许多重要任务中，紧凑而稳健地表示项目-属性关系的需求是必要的。此项任务的一种流行机器学习方法通过向量的高点积表示项目具有属性，这种表示不仅是密集的，而且还能够修正有噪声和不完整的数据。虽然该方法适用于通过单个属性（例如“喜剧电影”）检索项目的查询，但我们发现向量嵌入并不太准确支持组合查询（例如既是喜剧电影又是英国的，但不是浪漫电影）。为了解决这些集合论组合，本文提出用盒状嵌入替换向量，盒状嵌入是一种区域为基础的表示方法，可以看作可学习的文氏图。我们引入了一个新的组合查询基准数据集，并提供了实验和分析结果，以深入了解盒状嵌入的行为。",
