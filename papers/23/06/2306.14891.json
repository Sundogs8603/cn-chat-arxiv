    "abstract": "Image diffusion has recently shown remarkable performance in image synthesis and implicitly as an image prior. Such a prior has been used with conditioning to solve the inpainting problem, but only supporting binary user-based conditioning. We derive a fuzzy-conditioned diffusion, where implicit diffusion priors can be exploited with controllable strength. Our fuzzy conditioning can be applied pixel-wise, enabling the modification of different image components to varying degrees. Additionally, we propose an application to facial image correction, where we combine our fuzzy-conditioned diffusion with diffusion-derived attention maps. Our map estimates the degree of anomaly, and we obtain it by projecting on the diffusion space. We show how our approach also leads to interpretable and autonomous facial image correction.",

    "translated_abstract": "图像扩散最近在图像合成和隐式成为图像先验方面显示出了卓越的性能。这种先验已经用于条件化来解决修补问题，但只支持基于二进制用户的条件化。我们提出了一种模糊条件扩散，可以利用可控强度的隐式扩散先验。我们的模糊条件可以逐像素应用，使得可以以不同程度修改不同图像组成部分。此外，我们还提出了一种应用于面部图像修复的方法，将我们的模糊条件扩散与扩散引导的注意力图相结合。我们的注意力图可以估计异常的程度，通过在扩散空间上进行投影获得。我们展示了我们的方法也导致了解释性和自主的面部图像修复。",
