    "translated_abstract": "在投资行业中，对于许多目的包括市场映射、竞争对手分析和并购，进行细粒度公司相似性量化通常是至关重要的。我们提出并发布了一个名为CompanyKG的知识图，用于表示和学习多样化的公司特征和关系。具体而言，1.17百万家公司被表示为节点，丰富了公司描述嵌入; 15种不同的公司间关系导致了5106百万个带权重的边。为了实现对公司相似性量化方法的全面评估，我们设计并编译了三个带有注释测试集的评估任务: 相似性预测、竞争对手检索和相似性排序。我们对11种可重现预测方法进行了广泛的基准测试，分为节点、边和节点+边三组。据我们所知，CompanyKG是第一个大规模的异构图数据集",
