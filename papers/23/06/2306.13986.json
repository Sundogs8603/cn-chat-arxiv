    "abstract": "With their remarkably improved text generation and prompting capabilities, large language models can adapt existing written information into forms that are easier to use and understand. In our work, we focus on recipes as an example of complex, diverse, and widely used instructions. We develop a prompt grounded in the original recipe and ingredients list that breaks recipes down into simpler steps. We apply this prompt to recipes from various world cuisines, and experiment with several large language models (LLMs), finding best results with GPT-3.5. We also contribute an Amazon Mechanical Turk task that is carefully designed to reduce fatigue while collecting human judgment of the quality of recipe revisions. We find that annotators usually prefer the revision over the original, demonstrating a promising application of LLMs in serving as digital sous chefs for recipes and beyond. We release our prompt, code, and MTurk template for public use.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型具有极大的文本生成和提示功能，可以将现有的书面信息调整为更易于使用和理解的形式。本文以菜谱为例，展示了这一功能的应用，我们开发了一种基于原始菜谱和配料清单的提示，将菜谱分解为更简单的步骤，并将其应用到来自各种世界美食的菜谱中。我们使用了多种大型语言模型，并发现GPT-3.5的结果最好。我们还为公众提供了我们的提示、代码和MTurk模板。",
    "tldr": "本研究使用大型语言模型，以菜谱为例，开发了一种提示，可以将菜谱分解为更简单的步骤。通过Amazon Mechanical Turk任务，研究人员发现注释员通常更喜欢修改后的菜谱，这为大型语言模型作为数字厨师等服务提供了有前途的应用。",
