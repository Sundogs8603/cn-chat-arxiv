However, few works have been done on temporal HTN. This is partly due to the lack of a formal and consensual definition of what a temporal hierarchical planning problem is as well as the difficulty to develop heuristics in this context. In response to these inconveniences, we propose in this paper a new general POCL (Partial Order Causal Link) approach to represent and solve a temporal HTN problem by using existing heuristics developed to solve non temporal problems. We show experimentally that this approach is performant and can outperform the existing ones.",

    "translated_abstract": "层次任务网络（HTN）形式化语言被用于将各种规划问题表示为任务分解，并提出了许多解决它们的技术。然而，关于时态HTN问题的研究很少。这部分是因为缺乏时间层次规划问题的正式和一致的定义以及在这种情况下开发启发式方法的困难。为了应对这些不便，本文提出了一种新的基于部分有序因果链（POCL）的方法来表示和解决时间HTN问题，使用已开发的用于解决非时间问题的启发式方法。我们实验证明了这种方法具有高效性，并且可以胜过现有的方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new POCL-based approach to solve temporal HTN problems using existing non-temporal heuristics, addressing the lack of definition for temporal hierarchical planning problems and the difficulty in developing heuristics specifically for them. Experimental results show the effectiveness of this approach."
