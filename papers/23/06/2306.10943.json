While generated samples often are indistinguishable from real data, there is no guarantee that they will follow the true data distribution. In this work, we propose a method to ensure that the distributions of certain generated data statistics coincide with the respective distributions of the real data. In order to achieve this, we add a Kullback-Leibler term to the generator loss function: the KL divergence is taken between the true distributions as represented by a conditional energy-based model, and the corresponding generated distributions obtained from minibatch values at each iteration. We evaluate the method on a synthetic dataset and two real-world datasets and demonstrate improved performance of our method.",

    "translated_abstract": "生成对抗网络是一种强大的生成建模方法。虽然生成样本往往难以区分真实数据，但不能保证它们遵循真实数据分布。本文提出了一种方法，确保某些生成数据统计分布与真实数据的相应分布重合。为此，我们在生成器损失函数中添加了Kullback-Leibler项：KL散度是在每次迭代中从小批量值获得的相应生成分布和由条件能量模型表示的真实分布之间的差异。我们在一个合成数据集和两个实际数据集上评估了该方法，并展示了我们方法的优越性能。",
