    "translated_abstract": "从牙科放射图学中学习诊断特征和相关临床信息对于牙科研究非常重要。然而，缺乏专家注释的数据和便捷的搜索工具带来了挑战。我们的主要目标是设计一个利用用户的口腔相关研究查询的搜索工具。所提出的框架，对比语言图像检索搜索用于牙科研究，即Dental CLAIRES，利用根尖X射线片和相关临床细节（如牙周诊断、人口统计信息）根据文本查询检索最匹配的图像。我们应用对比表示学习方法，通过最大化正对匹配对（真实对）的相似性分数并最小化负对（随机对）的分数来找到由用户文本描述的图像。我们的模型实现了96%的hit@3比率和0.82的平均倒数排名（MRR）。我们还设计了一个图形用户界面，让研究人员可以验证模型的性能。",
