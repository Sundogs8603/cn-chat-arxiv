    "abstract": "Task-oriented dialogue is difficult in part because it involves understanding user intent, collecting information from the user, executing API calls, and generating helpful and fluent responses. However, for complex tasks one must also correctly do all of these things over multiple steps, and in a specific order. While large pre-trained language models can be fine-tuned end-to-end to create multi-step task-oriented dialogue agents that generate fluent text, our experiments confirm that this approach alone cannot reliably perform new multi-step tasks that are unseen during training. To address these limitations, we augment the dialogue contexts given to \\textmd{text2text} transformers with known \\textit{valid workflow names} and \\textit{action plans}. Action plans consist of sequences of actions required to accomplish a task, and are encoded as simple sequences of keywords (e.g. verify-identity, pull-up-account, reset-password, etc.). We perform extensive experiments on the Action-Based",

    "translated_abstract": "任务导向对话的难点在于涉及理解用户意图、从用户处收集信息、执行API调用以及生成有用流畅的回应。然而，对于复杂的任务，我们必须按特定顺序在多个步骤中正确地完成所有这些事情。虽然大型预训练语言模型可以进行端到端的微调来创建生成流畅文本的多步骤任务导向对话代理，但我们的实验证实，仅通过这种方法无法可靠地执行训练期间未见过的新多步骤任务。为了解决这些限制，我们增强了给出到text2text转换器的对话上下文，其中包括已知的有效工作流名称和行动计划。行动计划包括完成任务所需的行动序列，并编码为简单的关键字序列（例如，验证身份，拉起账户，重置密码等）。我们在基于行动的对话数据集上进行了广泛的实验。",
