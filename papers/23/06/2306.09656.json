    "translated_abstract": "为决定适当的干预措施，需要建立一个治疗、结果和潜在中介变量的因果模型。因果中介分析可以区分干预的直接和间接效应，但多数研究都在静态环境下进行。在医疗领域，数据以复杂的、不规则的时间序列形式呈现，而且治疗、结果和中介变量在时间上有动态相互依赖关系。现有的动态因果中介分析方法局限于规则的测量间隔、简单的参数模型，并忽略了中介变量-结果之间的长程交互作用。为解决这些限制，我们提出了一个非参数的中介变量-结果模型，其中中介变量被假定为与结果过程互动的时间点过程。使用这个模型，我们估计了对结果的外部干预的直接和间接效应，显示了每种效应如何影响整个未来轨迹。我们在半月板数据集上进行了演示。",
