    "translated_abstract": "传统上，可解释的推荐系统采用一种“一刀切”的方法，向每个用户提供相同程度的解释，而不考虑他们的个体需求和目标。此外，推荐系统中的解释大多以静态和非交互方式呈现。为填补这些研究空白，本文旨在采用以用户为中心的交互式解释模型，为用户提供不同细节级别的解释，并赋予用户基于其需求和偏好进行交互、控制和个性化解释的能力。我们采用以用户为中心的方法，设计了三个细节级别的交互式解释（基本、中级和高级），并在透明的推荐和兴趣建模应用（RIMA）中实现了它们。我们进行了一个定性用户研究（N=14），以调查提供不同细节级别的交互式解释对用户对系统可解释性的感知的影响。",
