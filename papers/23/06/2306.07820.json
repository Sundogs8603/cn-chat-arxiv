    "abstract": "This work builds on a previous work on unsupervised speech enhancement using a dynamical variational autoencoder (DVAE) as the clean speech model and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as the noise model. We propose to replace the NMF noise model with a deep dynamical generative model (DDGM) depending either on the DVAE latent variables, or on the noisy observations, or on both. This DDGM can be trained in three configurations: noise-agnostic, noise-dependent and noise adaptation after noise-dependent training. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised speech enhancement methods, while the noise-dependent training configuration yields a much more time-efficient inference process.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究基于一种使用动态变分自编码器(DVAE)作为清晰语音模型和非负矩阵分解(NMF)作为噪声模型的无监督语音增强方法。我们提出用深度动态生成模型(DDGM)代替NMF噪声模型，其中DDGM依赖于DVAE潜变量、嘈杂的观测值或两者。可以通过三种配置来训练DDGM：无噪声感知，依赖于噪声和噪声依赖训练后的噪声自适应。实验结果表明，与最先进的无监督语音增强方法相比，所提出的方法达到了竞争性的性能，而噪声依赖的训练配置使推理过程更加高效。",
