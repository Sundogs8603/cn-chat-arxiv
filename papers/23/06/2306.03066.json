    "abstract": "Behavioural experiments often happen in specialised arenas, but this may confound the analysis. To address this issue, we provide tools to study mice in the homecage environment, equipping biologists with the possibility to capture the temporal aspect of the individual's behaviour and model the interaction and interdependence between cage-mates with minimal human intervention. We develop the Activity Labelling Module (ALM) to automatically classify mouse behaviour from video, and a novel Group Behaviour Model (GBM) for summarising their joint behaviour across cages, using a permutation matrix to match the mouse identities in each cage to the model. We also release two datasets, ABODe for training behaviour classifiers and IMADGE for modelling behaviour.",

    "translated_abstract": "行为实验通常在专门的竞技场中进行，但这可能会混淆分析。为了解决这个问题，我们提供了工具来研究家鼠环境中的老鼠，为生物学家提供了捕捉个体行为的时间因素和模拟最小人为干预下笼友之间互动和相互依赖的可能性。我们开发了“活动标签模块”（ALM）来自动对老鼠行为进行分类，并开发了一种新的“群体行为模型”（GBM）来概括他们在笼子中的联合行为，使用置换矩阵将每个笼子中的老鼠身份与模型匹配。我们还发布了两个数据集，用于训练行为分类器（ABODe）和行为建模（IMADGE）。",
    "tldr": "本文提供了自动分类和模拟群体老鼠行为的工具，通过单一模型跨笼使用置换矩阵匹配老鼠身份，在家鼠环境下研究老鼠可以捕捉到个体行为的时间因素，而且无需人为干预。",

By studying mice in the homecage environment, individual behavior can be captured over time with minimal human intervention. This work also includes the release of two datasets for training behavior classifiers and modeling behavior."
