    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Categorical Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (C-GMCR), a novel framework that integrates category theory into the traditional Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR). The C-GMCR framework provides a more abstract and general way to model and analyze conflict resolution, enabling researchers to uncover deeper insights and connections. We present the basic concepts, methods, and application of the C-GMCR framework to the well-known Prisoner's Dilemma and other representative cases. The findings suggest that the categorical approach offers new perspectives on stability concepts and can potentially lead to the development of more effective conflict resolution strategies.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了冲突解决中的范畴图模型（C-GMCR），这是一种将范畴论整合到传统的图模型中的新型框架。C-GMCR框架提供了更抽象和通用的方式来建模和分析冲突解决，使研究人员能够发现更深层次的见解和联系。本文介绍了C-GMCR框架的基本概念、方法和应用到著名的囚徒困境和其他代表性案例中。结果表明，分类方法为稳定概念提供了新的视角，并有可能导致更有效的冲突解决策略的发展。",
