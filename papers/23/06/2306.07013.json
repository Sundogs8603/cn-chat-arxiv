    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于强化学习（RL）的投资策略在组合管理（PM）中被广泛采用。然而，大多数基于RL的方法往往强调追求回报，而忽视了潜在带来巨大损失的交易策略的风险，特别是在高市场波动性下。因此，提出了一种风险可管理的PM投资框架，该框架结合了RL和障碍函数（BF），以在PM应用中谨慎平衡高回报和可接受的风险敞口的需求。据我们所知，这项工作代表了首次尝试将BF和RL结合应用于金融领域。尽管涉及到的RL方法可能会积极寻找更有利可图的交易策略，但基于BF的风险控制器将持续监测市场状态，作为一种可控措施，动态调整投资组合以避免潜在损失，特别是在下跌市场中。此外，本论文提出了两种自适应模式来同时优化Risk-return和下降市场的抵御能力。",
