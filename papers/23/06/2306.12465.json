    "abstract": "Advancements in adapting deep convolution architectures for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have significantly enhanced image classification performance and reduced computational burdens. However, the inability of Multiplication-Free Inference (MFI) to harmonize with attention and transformer mechanisms, which are critical to superior performance on high-resolution vision tasks, imposes limitations on these gains. To address this, our research explores a new pathway, drawing inspiration from the progress made in Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). We propose an innovative spiking MLP architecture that uses batch normalization to retain MFI compatibility and introduces a spiking patch encoding layer to reinforce local feature extraction capabilities. As a result, we establish an efficient multi-stage spiking MLP network that effectively blends global receptive fields with local feature extraction for comprehensive spike-based computation. Without relying on pre-training or sophisticated SNN ",
