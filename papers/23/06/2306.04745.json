    "translated_abstract": "在监督学习下，训练一个从点云中检测三维人体关键点的检测器需要大量高质量的标注数据。尽管捕捉大量的人体点云相对容易，但标注三维关键点是昂贵、主观、容易出错，尤其是在长尾数据（具有罕见姿态的行人、骑轮滑者等）方面更加困难。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的无监督方法GC-KPL (基于几何一致性的关键点学习)，用于从点云中学习3D人体关节定位，无需任何人工标注。我们通过新颖的无监督损失公式，考虑了人体结构和运动状态，达到了合理的性能表现。此外，我们利用Waymo Open Dataset的大型训练集进行无人工标注关键点的训练，证明了该方法在监督学习方法中也有很好的性能表现。最后，我们的主干网络也从无监督训练中受益，并在下游的少样本学习中表现出了好的性能，通过微调可以实现更好的关键点定位。",
