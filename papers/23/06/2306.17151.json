    "translated_abstract": "在聚合问题中，目标是将给定类别的基本预测器组合起来，以实现几乎与最佳预测器一样准确的预测结果。在这个灵活的框架中，对类别的结构或目标的性质不做任何假设。聚合在顺序和统计上下文中都有研究。尽管这两个问题之间有一些重要的差异，但两种情况下的经典结果具有相同的全局复杂度度量。在本文中，通过用较小的局部复杂度替换全局复杂度，我们重新审视和加强了统计聚合理论中的经典结果。我们的一些证明基于Catoni引入的PAC-Bayes本地化技术。在其他结果中，我们证明了由Leung和Barron提出的指数权重估计器的局部版本的经典界限，以及Q-聚合估计器的偏差最优界限。这些界限改进了Dai，Rigollet和Zhang关于固定的结果。",
