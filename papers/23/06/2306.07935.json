    "abstract": "Inferring geographic locations via social posts is essential for many practical location-based applications such as product marketing, point-of-interest recommendation, and infector tracking for COVID-19. Unlike image-based location retrieval or social-post text embedding-based location inference, the combined effect of multi-modal information (i.e., post images, text, and hashtags) for social post positioning receives less attention. In this work, we collect real datasets of social posts with images, texts, and hashtags from Instagram and propose a novel Multi-modal Representation Learning Framework (MRLF) capable of fusing different modalities of social posts for location inference. MRLF integrates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance location-salient information extraction while significantly improving location inference compared with single domain-based methods. To overcome the noisy user-generated textual content, we introduce a novel attention-based character-aware module ",

    "translated_abstract": "通过社交媒体文章来推断地理位置对于许多实际的基于位置的应用程序非常重要，例如产品营销、兴趣点推荐及COVID-19的追踪。本研究从Instagram收集了带有图像、文本和标签的实际社交媒体文章数据集，提出了一种新颖的多模态表示学习框架（MRLF），它能够将社交媒体文章的不同模态融合起来进行位置推断。MRLF集成了一个多头注意力机制以增强位置显著信息提取，同时相对于单一领域的方法显著提高位置推断的准确性。为了克服用户生成的文本内容的噪声，我们引入了一种新颖的基于注意力的字符感知模块。",
