    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLM）的快速进展和所生成的文本数量的巨大增加，人工区分文本是否为机器生成变得越来越不切实际。考虑到LLM在社交媒体和教育中的广泛应用，促使我们开发检测机器生成文本的方法，以防止恶意使用，如抄袭、虚假信息和宣传。以前的研究已经研究了几种零样本的方法，这些方法不需要训练数据。这些方法取得了良好的性能，但还有很大的改进空间。本文介绍了两种新的零样本方法，用于利用对数秩信息检测机器生成文本。其中一个称为DetectLLM-LRR，快速高效，另一个称为DetectLLM-NPR，更精确，但需要扰动，因此速度更慢。我们在三个数据集和七个语言模型上的实验表明，我们提出的方法在零样本检测机器生成文本方面超过了现有的最佳效果。",
