The key motivation of our framework is to view any multivariate time series as a cumulative sum of fine-grained trajectory increments, with each increment governed by a novel spin-gas dynamical Ising model. This fine-grained perspective motivates the development of a parsimonious set of operators that summarize multivariate time series in an abstract fashion, serving as the foundation for large-scale automated feature engineering.

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了可编程特征工程的概念，提出了一个特征编程框架，为嘈杂的多元时间序列生成大量预测特征，同时允许用户以最小的工作量结合他们的归纳偏差。我们的框架的关键动机是将任何多元时间序列视为细粒度轨迹增量的累积总和，其中每个增量由一种新型自旋气体动力学伊辛模型控制。这种细粒度的视角激发了发展一个简约的算子集，以抽象的方式总结多元时间序列，为大规模的自动特征工程提供基础。数值上，我们验证了我们的方法在几个合成和真实世界的嘈杂时间序列数据集上的有效性。",
