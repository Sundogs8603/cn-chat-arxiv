    "translated_abstract": "面向非语义任务，例如语言识别的语音表示学习方法，要么探索使用分类器模型的监督嵌入提取方法，要么使用原始数据的自我监督表示学习方法。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的框架，将自我监督表示学习与语言标签信息相结合进行预训练任务。这个框架被称为基于标签感知的语音表示（LASR）学习，并使用基于三元组的目标函数将语言标签与自我监督损失函数相结合。语音表示进一步针对下游任务进行微调。语言识别实验在两个公共数据集 - FLEURS和Dhwani上进行。在这些实验中，我们说明所提出的LASR框架在语言识别上优于现有技术。我们还报告了LASR方法对于噪声/丢失标签的鲁棒性分析。",
