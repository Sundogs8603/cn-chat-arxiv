To address this shortfall, we theoretically quantify the expected size of the prediction set under the split conformal prediction framework. As this precise formulation cannot usually be calculated directly, we further derive point estimates and high probability intervals that can be easily computed, providing a practical method for characterizing the expected prediction set size across different possible realizations of the test and calibration data.

    "translated_abstract": "虽然适应性预测器在误差频率方面具有严格的统计保证，但其预测集大小对其实际效用至关重要。不幸的是，目前缺乏有限样本分析和预测集大小的保证。为了解决这个问题，我们在分裂适应性预测框架下理论量化预测集的期望大小。因为这种精确的计算通常无法直接计算，我们进一步推导出可轻松计算的点估计和高概率区间，提供了一种描述测试和校准数据不同可能实现的期望预测集大小的实用方法。此外，我们通过对回归和分类问题的真实世界数据集进行实验证实了我们结果的实用性。",
