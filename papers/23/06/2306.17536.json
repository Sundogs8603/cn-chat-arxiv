    "translated_abstract": "在恶劣的天气和光照条件下，知道自己所处的位置是否有助于感知周围的物体？本研究探讨了是否可以利用先验地图来帮助检测场景中的动态物体，而无需使用3D地图或像素级地图查询对应。我们提出了一种算法，通过先验地图优化初始的候选物体检测，并产生一个经过精确修正的子集。我们首先使用视觉场所识别（VPR）来为给定的查询图像检索参考地图图像，然后使用一个二进制分类神经网络比较查询和参考图像区域以验证查询检测。当我们的分类网络经过训练，在大约1000对查询-地图图像对上，与现有的现成车辆检测器结合起来，它能够提高车辆检测的性能。我们使用标准数据集演示了我们的方法。",
