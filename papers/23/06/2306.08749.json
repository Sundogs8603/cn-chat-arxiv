    "translated_abstract": "尽管使用语音识别软件可以缩短放射学报告的完成时间，但持续的沟通错误会对放射学报告的解释产生重大影响。预填充放射学报告在减轻报告错误方面具有潜力，尽管文献中存在生成医学报告的努力，但对于利用MIMIC-CXR数据集中的患者就诊记录的纵向特性缺乏方法。为了解决这一差距，我们提出使用纵向多模态数据，即以前的患者就诊CXR、当前就诊CXR和以前的就诊报告，来预先填充当前患者就诊报告的“发现”部分。我们首先从MIMIC-CXR数据集中收集了26,625名患者的纵向就诊信息，并创建了一个名为Longitudinal-MIMIC的新数据集。利用这个新数据集，我们训练了一个基于transformer的模型，以捕获包含多模态纵向就诊记录的信息。",
