We first give a general reduction theorem that transforms an offline approximation algorithm with low average sensitivity to an online algorithm with low $\\epsilon$-approximate regret. We then demonstrate that offline approximation algorithms can be transformed into a low-sensitivity version using a coreset construction method. To showcase the versatility of our approach, we apply it to various problems, including online $(k,z)$-clustering, online matrix approximation, and online regression, and successfully achieve polylogarithmic $\\epsilon$-approximate regret for each problem.
