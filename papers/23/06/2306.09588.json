    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在线学习中反馈对切换成本的作用。已经证明，在赌博反馈下，极小化最大后悔为$\\widetilde{\\Theta}(T^{2/3})$，并在完全信息反馈下提高到$\\widetilde{\\Theta}(\\sqrt{T})$，其中$T$为时间跨度的长度。然而，目前仍然不知道反馈的数量和类型通常如何影响后悔。为此，我们首先考虑了带有额外观测的赌博学习环境；也就是说，除了典型的赌博反馈外，学习者可以自由地进行总共$B_{ex}$次额外的观测。我们完全确定了这种情况下的最小后悔，它表现出有趣的相变现象：当$B_{ex}=O(T^{2/3})$时，后悔仍然为$\\widetilde{\\Theta}(T^{2/3})$，但当$B_{ex}=\\Omega(T^{2/3})$时，它变为$\\widetilde{\\Theta}(T/\\sqrt{B_{\\mathrm{ex}}})$，随着预算$B_{ex}$的增加而得到改善。",
