    "translated_abstract": "本文将对未标记数据中的有噪声二元分类器的评估作为流式任务进行研究: 给定一个分类器决策的数据草图，估计标签的真实流行度以及每个分类器对它们的准确度。本文构建了两种完全代数化的评估器来实现这一目标。两种评估器都基于分类器产生独立错误的假设。第一种是基于多数投票的。而第二种则是本文的主要贡献，并被保证是正确的。但是如何确保分类器在任何给定的测试中是独立的呢？本文通过利用独立评估器无法返回合理估计的失败来缓解这个委托/代理监控悖论。通过利用代数故障模式来拒绝太相关的评估集合，使用 \\texttt{adult}，\\texttt{mushroom} 和 \\texttt{two-norm} 数据集对一组几乎无误差三元组进行了实证搜索。这些搜索通过构建评估空间中的表面来进行精细化。",
