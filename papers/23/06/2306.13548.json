    "abstract": "We propose a novel approach that utilizes fuzzification theory to perform feature selection on website content for encryption purposes. Our objective is to identify and select the most relevant features from the website by harnessing the principles of fuzzy logic. Fuzzification allows us to transform the crisp website content into fuzzy representations, enabling a more nuanced analysis of their characteristics. By considering the degree of membership of each feature in different fuzzy categories, we can evaluate their importance and relevance for encryption. This approach enables us to prioritize and focus on the features that exhibit higher membership degrees, indicating their significance in the encryption process. By employing fuzzification-based feature selection, we aim to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of website content encryption, ultimately improving the overall internet security.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种利用模糊化理论对网站内容进行特征选择进行加密的新方法。我们的目的是通过利用模糊逻辑的原理识别和选择网站中最相关的特征。模糊化允许我们将清晰的网站内容转换为模糊表示，从而更加细致地分析其特征。通过考虑每个特征在不同模糊类别中的成员资格程度，我们可以评估它们在加密中的重要性和相关性。这种方法使我们能够优先关注展示出更高会员资格度的特征，表明它们在加密过程中的重要性。通过采用基于模糊化的特征选择方法，我们旨在提高网站内容加密的效率和有效性，最终改善整体互联网安全性。",
