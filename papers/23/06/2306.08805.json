    "translated_abstract": "经典学习理论表明适当的正则化是好的泛化和鲁棒性的关键。在分类中，当前的训练方案仅针对分类器本身的复杂性，这可能会导致误导和无效。相反，我们主张直接测量决策边界的复杂性。现有文献在这个领域的定义有限，边界复杂性的定义也往往存在争议。我们以ReLU神经网络为例进行概念证明，这些网络的边界复杂形态可以方便地用仿射片段的数量来刻画。我们借助于热带几何，发展了一种新方法，可以明确计算出边界精确的片段数量。实验表明，边界片段计数在训练中的独特性质与实际分类一致，与其他测量，例如权重的总和$l_2$范数相比，独立性更好。此外，边界片段计数与泛化性能的相关性更高，具有其他复杂度量度不能比拟的优势。我们的工作强调了测量边界复杂性的重要性，并提供了基于边界区域计数的实际分类器正则化工具。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a new complexity measure for classifiers based on the exact count of boundary pieces of ReLU neural networks and shows that this measure correlates better with generalization performance than other existing measures. The proposed method sheds light on the importance of measuring boundary complexity and provides a practical tool to regularize classifiers."
