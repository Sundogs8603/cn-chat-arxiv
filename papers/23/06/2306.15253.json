    "translated_abstract": "人类在交流中自由表达意义或共识的同时进行对话。尽管大型生成语言模型具有令人印象深刻的对话能力，但它们并未考虑到共享的场景环境中个体的上下文理解差异。本文提出了MindDial，一种新颖的对话框架，可以生成场景化的自由对话来协商共识。我们设计了一个明确的心智模块，可以追踪三个层次的信念，即说话者的信念、说话者对听众信念的预测以及基于前两者之间的共同信念。然后，说话行为分类头将决定是否继续对话、结束此轮对话或采取与任务相关的行动。我们使用了一个共识对齐的数据集MutualFriend，增加了信念动态注释，目标是根据两个代理之间的自由对话找到一个共同的朋友。实验证明，我们的模型在心智状态建模方面取得了良好的效果。",
