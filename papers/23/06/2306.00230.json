    "translated_abstract": "最近对物理信息神经网络(PINN)方法的兴趣激增，导致了一系列研究证明了它们解决偏微分方程(PDE)和预测物理系统动力学的潜力。然而，PINN的预测局限性还没有得到深入的研究。本研究研究了2D圆柱周围的流动，发现无数据的PINN无法预测涡 shedding。数据驱动的PINN只有在训练数据(来自传统CFD求解器)可用时才显示涡 shedding，但当数据流停止时，它会恢复到稳态解。我们进行了动态模态分解，并分析了通过PINN和传统流体求解器(PetIBM)获得的解中的Koopman模式。Koopman特征值在复平面上的分布表明，PINN在数值上是展散和扩散的。 PINN方法可能是由于谱偏差，才恢复到稳态解。",
    "tldr": "本文研究发现，物理信息神经网络（PINN）在涡 shedding 上预测的局限性较大，数据驱动型的PINN只有在训练数据可用时才能预测涡 shedding，且可能是由于谱偏差的原因，PINN会恢复到稳态解。",
