    "abstract": "Automatic Arabic diacritization is useful in many applications, ranging from reading support for language learners to accurate pronunciation predictor for downstream tasks like speech synthesis. While most of the previous works focused on models that operate on raw non-diacritized text, production systems can gain accuracy by first letting humans partly annotate ambiguous words. In this paper, we propose 2SDiac, a multi-source model that can effectively support optional diacritics in input to inform all predictions. We also introduce Guided Learning, a training scheme to leverage given diacritics in input with different levels of random masking. We show that the provided hints during test affect more output positions than those annotated. Moreover, experiments on two common benchmarks show that our approach i) greatly outperforms the baseline also when evaluated on non-diacritized text; and ii) achieves state-of-the-art results while reducing the parameter count by over 60%.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动化的阿拉伯语音标注在很多应用场景中都非常有用，比如对于语言学习者来说，标注可以提供阅读支持，而对于语音合成这样的下游任务，标注准确性对于发音预测也非常重要。之前的研究大多数专注于处理没有音标的原始文本的模型，但是通过给人类提供选定的或部分标注的敏感词汇，可以使得生产系统的准确性更高。本文提出了一个名为2SDiac的多源模型，可以有效地支持输入中的可选音标以确定所有预测的输出。此外，本文还引入了一种称为Guided Learning的训练策略，可以利用给定的输入音标和不同等级的随机掩蔽来提升标注的正确性。我们展示了测试期间提供的标注能够影响更多的输出位置，实验结果还表明，我们的方法可以在非标记文本上表现出优异的效果，并且可以在减少60%的参数数目的情况下实现最先进的结果。",
