    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种数据驱动的学习框架，融合了两个强大的思想：来自湍流封闭模型的理想大涡模拟（LES）和用于随机建模的神经随机微分方程（SDE）。理想LES通过将每个完整轨迹视为潜在动力学的随机实现来对LES流进行建模，从而将小尺度效应边际化以获得LES状态的确定性演化。但是，理想LES在分析上是难以处理的。在本文中，我们使用潜在的神经SDE来模拟随机过程的演化，并使用编码器-解码器对潜在空间和所需的理想流场之间进行转换。这与其他类型的闭合模型神经参数化的处理方式形成了鲜明的对比，其他处理方式将每个轨迹视为动力学的确定实现。我们在具有挑战性的混沌动力学系统Kolmogorov flow上展示了我们方法（niLES - 神经理想LES）的有效性。",
