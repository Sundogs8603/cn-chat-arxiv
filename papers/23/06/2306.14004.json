    "en_tdlr": "This paper develops inferential tools for latent factor analysis in short panels, and generates the likelihood ratio statistic and AUMPI characterization. The empirical application shows that idiosyncratic volatility in short subperiods is increasing while systematic risk remains stable over the sample period."
