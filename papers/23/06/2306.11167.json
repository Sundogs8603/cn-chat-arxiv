    "translated_abstract": "自从人工智能诞生以来，对人类仿真智能的追求一直是人工智能研究的持久话题。最新一代的大型语言模型（LLM）的技术演进和新兴能力将这个主题从学术界带到了文化时代。尽管最近的NLP评估基准任务测试了人类仿真行为的一些方面（例如BIG-bench的“类人行为”任务），但几乎没有一个任务考察创造性问题解决能力。人类的创造性问题解决是认知神经科学中研究较为深入的主题，标准化测试主要使用将线索词之间的（异构）连接能力作为创造性的度量。在这样的任务中，暗示性的误导性刺激-被称为“诱导误解”的干扰因素-通过固定效应和Einstellung范式阻碍了人类的表现。在认知神经科学的研究中，通过事先让参与者接触到有相似拼写的错误因素来实验性地诱导这样的固定。",
    "tldr": "这项研究探索了大型语言模型（LLMs）对创造性问题解决的能力，并发现大型语言模型容易被误导，出现固定效应和Einstellung范式。"
