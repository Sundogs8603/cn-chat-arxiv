    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于交互式证明系统的分类器在实现AI理论可解释性方面取得了进展。证明者从数据点中选择证书并将其发送给验证者，后者决定分类。在机器学习的背景下，这样的证书可以是信息性的特征。对于高度保真与完备性的设定，交换的证书必须与数据点的真实分类有高的相互信息。然而，这种保证依赖于数据集的非对称特征相关性的界限，这是迄今为止难以估计高维数据的属性。W\\\"aldchen等人猜测，利用AFC是计算上困难的，我们在这里证明了这一点。我们考虑恶意的证明者-验证者二元组，旨在利用AFC来实现高的完备性和保真性，同时使用没有信息的证书。我们证明了这个任务是$\\mathsf{NP}$难的。",
