    "translated_abstract": "在线平台彻底改变了美国社交生活。它们民主化了出版，推翻了旧的监管者，并给普通美国人在政治上带来了新的发声机会。但这个系统开始出现问题。在线言论的控制权掌握在少数几个人手中——Facebook、Google 和 Twitter ——他们为整个国家监管内容。这是一项不可能完成的任务。美国人甚至不能在自己之间达成一致，哪些言论应该被允许。更重要的是，各平台有自己的利益:边缘理论和恶毒的口名声会赶走用户。适度的管理对商业有好处。但平台美化对社会不受欢迎的成员产生了影响，他们的丑陋声音在这个过程中被压制。由于在线言论的控制权如此集中，线上社群中的异类被剥夺了表达的途径。集中的私人控制对重要资源的控制是一个古老的问题。例如，上个世纪铁路和电话公司的兴起，都变得非常强大，他们有能力向消费者和立法者主导政策。鉴于这些问题，本文探讨了改革在线平台格局的可能性。",
