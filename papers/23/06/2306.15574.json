In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum learning-based approach to train deep learning models to handle occluded medical images effectively. Our method progressively introduces occlusion, starting from clear, unobstructed images and gradually moving to images with increasing occlusion levels. This ordered learning process, akin to human learning, allows the model to first grasp simple, discernable patterns and subsequently build upon this knowledge to understand more complicated, occluded scenarios.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习模型在医学图像解释方面取得了革命性的进展，显著提高了诊断准确性。然而，这些模型在具有部分或完全遮挡的复杂图像上往往表现不佳，而这在临床实践中非常常见。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于课程学习的全新方法，用于训练深度学习模型有效处理遮挡医学图像。我们的方法逐步引入遮挡，从清晰、无遮挡的图像开始，逐渐过渡到遮挡程度不断增加的图像。这种有序的学习过程类似于人类学习的过程，使模型首先掌握简单、可辨别的模式，然后在此基础上逐渐理解更复杂的遮挡场景。此外，我们还提出了三种全新的遮挡生成方法，分别是Wasserstein课程学习（WCL）、信息自适应学习（IAL）和测地线课程学习（Geodesic Curriculum Learn）。",
