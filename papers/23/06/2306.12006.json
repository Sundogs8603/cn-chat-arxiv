    "translated_abstract": "多尺度偏微分方程在各种应用中都有出现。齐次化理论是消除小尺度依赖的强有力方法，可以得到简化的方程以及计算上的便利。在连续介质力学领域，齐次化对于导出包含微观物理学的本构定律以制定感兴趣的宏观量的平衡方程很关键。然而，获得齐次化本构定律通常是具有挑战性的，因为它们通常没有解析形式，并且可以展现在微观尺度上不存在的现象。针对这个问题，提出了数据驱动的学习本构定律方法。本文提出了一种新的基于数据驱动的学习椭圆算子齐次化映射的方法，可以说明与这种接口有关的齐次化建立。我们的方法通过构造适当的特征空间，以考虑底层几何学和微观结构，自适应地学习将这些接口合并到齐次化本构定律中。我们的数字结果表明，所提出的方法可以准确地捕捉有效的宏观行为，优于现有方法。",
