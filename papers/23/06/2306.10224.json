    "translated_abstract": "生成式 AI 工具（如 ChatGPT）可以从根本上改变投资者处理信息的方式。我们使用股票市场作为实验室，探究这些工具在总结复杂的公司披露信息时的经济效用。总结摘要明显更短，通常比原始文本缩短超过 70%，而信息内容得到增强。当一份文件具有积极（消极）情感时，其总结变得更积极（消极）。更重要的是，总结对解释股市对披露信息的反应更有效。基于这些发现，我们提出了信息“膨胀”指标。我们显示，膨胀的披露与负面的资本市场后果相关，例如更低的价格有效性和更高的信息不对称性。最后，我们展示了这个模型在构建针对性总结方面的有效性，以确定公司的（非）财务表现和风险。总之，我们的研究结果表明，像 ChatGPT 这样的生成式 AI 工具可以有效地帮助投资者更高效地处理财务信息。",
