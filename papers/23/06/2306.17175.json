    "translated_abstract": "临床决策是向患者提供适当护理的基本阶段。近年来，为了帮助临床医生在这个过程中做出决策，已经开发了几个决策系统。然而，目前使用的技术解决方案基于简单的回归模型，只能考虑简单的预定义多选特征，如患者年龄、既往病史、吸烟者状况等。决策系统当前无法处理的一个特定患者数据来源是患者会诊的GP笔记的收集。这些笔记包含了临床医生用来做出最终决策并将患者引导到适当护理的关键体征和症状。从GP笔记中提取信息是一个技术上具有挑战性的问题，因为它们往往包含缩写、打字错误和不完整的句子。本文解决了这个公开挑战。我们提出了一个框架，可以执行从原始GP笔记中提取出关键信息，并构建知识图谱的任务。",
