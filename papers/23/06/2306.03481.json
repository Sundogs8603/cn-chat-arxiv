    "translated_abstract": "纠缠作为增强量子计算的资源，已经在学习量子动力学中得到了应用。将纠缠融入到量子机器学习模型的操作或测量中，可以显著降低训练数据大小，同时在达到指定预测误差阈值时取得了更优的结果。然而，关于纠缠程度对模型性能的影响，目前仍缺乏分析性理解。本研究通过在学习量子动力学中使用纠缠数据，建立了量子不免费午餐定理。与以往发现的结果相反，我们证明了纠缠数据对预测误差的影响呈现出双重效应，取决于允许的测量次数。在有充分的测量次数的情况下，增加训练数据的纠缠度可以持续降低预测误差，或减少达到给定误差阈值所需的训练数据大小。本研究阐明了纠缠数据在量子机器学习中的关键转换作用，并提供了改进性能的量子机器学习模型设计指南。",
