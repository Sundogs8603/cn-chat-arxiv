    "translated_abstract": "点过程模型广泛用于分析图中异步事件，反映不同类型事件之间的相互影响。预测未来事件的时间和类型是一项关键任务，并且图的大小和拓扑结构增加了问题的难度。最近的神经点过程模型揭示了捕捉复杂的事件类别之间依赖关系的可能性。然而，这些方法在每个目标事件类型的强度计算中使用了包括所有事件类别在内的未经滤波的事件记录。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于潜在图拓扑的图点过程方法。对应的无向图具有代表事件类别的节点和表示潜在贡献关系的边。然后，我们开发了一种新颖的深度图核来描述事件之间的触发和抑制效应。本质影响结构通过图神经网络-based的局部邻域信息聚合进行了融合。我们在合成和实际数据集上展示了我们提出的方法比最先进的模型更具优越性。",
