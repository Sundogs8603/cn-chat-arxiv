    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a solution for tackling the passive eavesdropping problem in wireless communication with attackers' unknown location and channel state information by deploying a UAV as a mobile aerial relay (AR) to support vulnerable users. The solution clusters single-antenna users and applies optimized multi-user beamforming to them. The AR's 3D position, multi-user beamforming matrix, and transmission powers are optimized using a combination of closed-form solutions and machine learning techniques. The algorithm combines deep reinforcement learning with traditional beamforming methods and is shown to improve user security against passive eavesdropping attacks."
