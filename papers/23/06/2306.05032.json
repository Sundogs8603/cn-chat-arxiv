    "translated_abstract": "系统日志在维护软件系统可靠性方面起着关键作用。已有研究探索了自动基于日志的异常检测，并在基准数据集上取得了显著的准确性。然而，当应用于大规模云系统时，这些解决方案由于高资源消耗和缺乏对不断变化的日志数据的适应性而面临限制。因此，本文提出了一种准确，轻量级和自适应的基于日志的异常检测框架——SeaLog。我们的方法引入了一种基于 Trie 的检测代理 (TDA)，它利用一种轻量级、动态增长的 Trie 结构进行实时异常检测。为了增强 TDA 对不断变化的日志数据的准确性，我们使其能够从专家获得反馈。有趣的是，我们的研究发现，现代的大语言模型，如 ChatGPT，可以提供与人类专家相当一致性的反馈，这可能有助于减少手动验证的工作量。我们对该方法进行了全面的实验评估，并证明了其在大规模环境下的可扩展性和高效性。",
