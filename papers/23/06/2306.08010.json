    "translated_abstract": "领域转移被认为是机器学习中的一个挑战，因为它会导致模型性能的显著降低。在声景分类任务中，领域转移主要由不同的录音设备引起。已经有一些研究针对领域泛化进行改进，以提高在新领域中（如新设备）ASC模型的性能。最近，在自然语言处理中提出了可控门控适配器ConGater，以解决偏见训练数据的问题。ConGater允许在推理时控制去偏的过程。ConGater的主要优点是在推理过程中对训练模型进行连续和选择性去偏。在本文中，我们将ConGater适应于音频频谱变换器，用于声景分类任务。我们展示了ConGater可以用于有选择性地使学习表示与记录设备等领域转移不变。我们的分析表明，ConGater可以逐步提高ASC模型在看不见的领域上的性能，超过现有的领域泛化方法。",
