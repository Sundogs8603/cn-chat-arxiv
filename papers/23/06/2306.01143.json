    "abstract": "Low probability of detection (LPD) has recently emerged as a means to enhance the privacy and security of wireless networks. Unlike existing wireless security techniques, LPD measures aim to conceal the entire existence of wireless communication instead of safeguarding the information transmitted from users. Motivated by LPD communication, in this paper, we study a privacy-preserving and distributed framework based on graph neural networks to minimise the detectability of a wireless ad-hoc network as a whole and predict an optimal communication region for each node in the wireless network, allowing them to communicate while remaining undetected from external actors. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of two performance measures, i.e., mean absolute error and median absolute error.",

    "translated_abstract": "近期低探测概率技术被用于提升无线网络的隐私和安全性，相较于其他技术，它并非保护信息的传输，而是全面隐藏无线通信的存在。本文基于低探测概率通信，提出了一个基于图神经网络的分布式框架，以最小化整个无线自组网的探测概率并预测每个节点的最佳通信区域，使得节点在与外部无人发现的情况下进行通信。此外，本文还用平均绝对误差和中位数绝对误差两种性能指标来证明所提出方法的有效性。",
