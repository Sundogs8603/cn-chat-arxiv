    "abstract": "Diffusion Models (DMs) are state-of-the-art generative models that learn a reversible corruption process from iterative noise addition and denoising. They are the backbone of many generative AI applications, such as text-to-image conditional generation. However, recent studies have shown that basic unconditional DMs (e.g., DDPM and DDIM) are vulnerable to backdoor injection, a type of output manipulation attack triggered by a maliciously embedded pattern at model input. This paper presents a unified backdoor attack framework (VillanDiffusion) to expand the current scope of backdoor analysis for DMs. Our framework covers mainstream unconditional and conditional DMs (denoising-based and score-based) and various training-free samplers for holistic evaluations. Experiments show that our unified framework facilitates the backdoor analysis of different DM configurations and provides new insights into caption-based backdoor attacks on DMs.",

    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型（DM）是最先进的生成模型之一，它通过迭代添加噪声和去噪学习可逆的损坏过程。它们是许多生成人工智能应用的主干，例如文本到图像有条件生成。但是，最近的研究表明基本无条件DM（例如DDPM和DDIM）易受后门注入攻击，这是一种由于恶意嵌入模型输入的模式而触发的输出操纵攻击。本文提出了一个统一的后门攻击框架（VillanDiffusion），以扩展当前的DM后门分析范围。我们的框架涵盖了主流的无条件和有条件DM（基于去噪和基于评分），以及各种无需训练的采样器进行整体评估。实验证明，我们的统一框架便于对不同DM配置进行后门分析，并为基于字幕的DM后门攻击提供新的见解。",
