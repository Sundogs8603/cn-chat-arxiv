    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在先进制造系统的在线感知监测中得到广泛应用。然而，在异常条件下收集的传感器数据通常是不充分的，这会导致监督式机器学习中的严重数据不平衡问题。为了解决这个问题，一种常见的方法是采用数据增强技术，即通过合成生成来增加可用的异常状态数据（即少数样本）。为了有效地生成高质量的少数样本，学习异常状态数据的基础分布至关重要。近年来，基于生成对抗网络（GAN）的方法成为学习数据分布以及执行数据增强的流行技术。然而，在实践中，基于GAN的数据增强生成的样本质量可能会有很大的差异。此外，传感器信号是按时间从制造系统中顺序收集的，这意味着考虑到时间的顺序性是重要的。",
