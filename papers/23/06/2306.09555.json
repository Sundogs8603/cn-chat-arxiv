    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑检测多个独立时间序列中的多个变点的问题。寻找最佳分割可以表达为在给定成本函数上的最小化问题。我们专注于解决此问题的动态规划算法。当变化次数与数据长度成比例时，PELT算法中编码的基于不等式的剪枝规则会导致线性时间复杂度。另一种称为函数剪枝的剪枝方法，对于分析单变量时间序列而言，无论变化次数如何，其时间复杂度都接近于线性。我们提出了一些基于使用简单几何形状（球体和超矩形）的函数剪枝的扩展，重点关注高斯情况，但我们的一些规则可以轻松扩展到指数族。在模拟研究中，我们比较了不同基于几何的剪枝规则的计算效率。我们表明，在小维度情况下，使用超矩形和球体进行剪枝可以比函数剪枝更快速地准确检测更好。对于较大维度，超矩形变得不那么高效，而球体仅在高信噪比的情况下仍然具有竞争力。",
