    "translated_abstract": "生成人工智能技术（GenAI）已成为一种强大的技术，能够自主地在各个领域（如文本、图像、音频和视频）生成高度逼真的内容。由于在创意艺术、内容生成、虚拟助手和数据综合等方面有积极的应用潜力，因此引起了广泛的关注和采用。然而，GenAI的普及不断增加，引发了人们对其可能被用于制作逼真的网络钓鱼邮件、通过深度伪造视频生成虚假信息和通过看起来逼真的社交媒体帖子传播虚假信息等方面的担忧，这给网络安全带来了一系列新的挑战和风险。为了应对GenAI所带来的威胁，我们提出利用网络攻击生命周期来理解网络攻击的生命周期，作为网络防御的基础模型。本文旨在全面分析GenAI技术在网络攻击中可能引入的风险领域。",
