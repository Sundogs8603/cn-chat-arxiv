    "abstract": "Reliable real-world deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) methods requires a nuanced understanding of their strengths and weaknesses and how they compare to those of humans. Human-machine systems are becoming more prevalent and the design of these systems relies on a task-oriented understanding of both human learning (HL) and RL. Thus, an important line of research is characterizing how the structure of a learning task affects learning performance. While increasingly complex benchmark environments have led to improved RL capabilities, such environments are difficult to use for the dedicated study of task structure. To address this challenge we present a learning environment built to support rigorous study of the impact of task structure on HL and RL. We demonstrate the environment's utility for such study through example experiments in task structure that show performance differences between humans and RL algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "可靠地部署强化学习方法在现实世界中需要对它们的优点和缺点以及与人类的比较进行细致的理解。人机系统越来越普遍，而这些系统的设计依赖于对人类学习和强化学习的任务导向理解。因此，一个重要的研究方向是对学习任务结构如何影响学习性能进行表征。虽然越来越复杂的基准环境已经提高了强化学习能力，但这些环境很难用来专门研究任务结构。为了解决这个挑战，我们提供了一个支持严密研究任务结构对人类学习和强化学习影响的学习环境。通过任务结构的示例实验，我们展示了这个环境在这方面研究中的实用性，显示出人类和强化学习算法之间的性能差异。",
