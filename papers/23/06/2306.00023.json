    "translated_abstract": "目前，许多研究人员和分析师正致力于改善各种疾病的医学诊断。心脏病是一种常见疾病，可视为全球重要死因。早期发现心脏病有助于显著降低心力衰竭的风险。因此，疾病控制和预防中心每年从400,000多名参与者中进行与健康相关的电话调查。然而，人们对于预测心脏病的数据可靠性以及是否所有调查问题都具有强相关性提出了一些担忧。本研究旨在利用支持向量机和逻辑回归等多种机器学习技术，以调查美国疾病控制和预防中心的心脏病调查准确性。此外，我们使用各种特征选择方法来确定可以用于预测心脏病的最相关的问题子集。为了得出有力的结论，我们在全国健康和营养调查数据集上测试了开发的模型。结果表明，使用有限的问题集可以显著缩短调查时间，同时仍然保持高的心脏病预测准确率。",
