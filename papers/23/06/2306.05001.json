We attribute the failure to two reasons: First, The pre-training methods are designed for well-defined computer vision tasks concentrating on semantic features, and they cannot learn personalized interest in recommendations. Secondly, pre-trained image embeddings only containing semantic information have little information gain, considering we already have semantic features such as categories and item titles as inputs in the CTR prediction task.

    "translated_abstract": "随着多媒体互联网的发展，视觉特征已成为影响用户兴趣的重要因素。因此，将视觉特征融入点击率（CTR）预测的进一步提升方向是颇具前景的。但我们发现，仅将已有预训练方法训练得到的图像嵌入注入到模型中仅能产生较小的改进。我们将这种现象归因于以下两个原因：首先，预训练方法是为了明确的、重点放在语义特征上的计算机视觉任务而设计的，无法学习到个性化推荐中的个人兴趣; 其次，预训练的只包含语义信息的图像嵌入与我们在CTR预测任务中所已有的类别和物品标题等语义特征相比有较小的信息增益。我们认为需要一种针对推荐任务的预训练方法以获得更多改进。为此，我们提出了一种基于对比学习的推荐方法。",
