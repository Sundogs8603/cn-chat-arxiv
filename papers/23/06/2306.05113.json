    "abstract": "We consider a class of zero-sum stopper vs.\\ singular-controller games in which the controller can only act on a subset $d_0<d$ of the $d$ coordinates of a controlled diffusion. Due to the constraint on the control directions these games fall outside the framework of recently studied variational methods. In this paper we develop an approximation procedure, based on $L^1$-stability estimates for the controlled diffusion process and almost sure convergence of suitable stopping times. That allows us to prove existence of the game's value and to obtain an optimal strategy for the stopper, under continuity and growth conditions on the payoff functions. This class of games is a natural extension of (single-agent) singular control problems, studied in the literature, with similar constraints on the admissible controls.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一类零和stopper vs. singular-controller博弈，在该博弈中控制者只能作用于受控扩散的 $d_0<d$ 个坐标子集。由于控制方向的限制，这些博弈不属于最近研究的变分方法框架。我们基于受控扩散过程的 $L^1$ -稳定性估计和适当停时的几乎必然收敛来开发一种逼近程序。在收益函数连续增长的条件下，这样可以证明游戏价值的存在并获得stopper的最优策略。这类博弈是单智能体奇异控制问题的自然推广，其控制受到类似的限制。",
