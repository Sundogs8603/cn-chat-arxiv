    "translated_abstract": "关系抽取是指从非结构化文本中识别实体之间的关系。关系抽取是许多自然语言处理应用的基础，例如知识图谱补全、问答和信息检索。近年来，深度神经网络在关系抽取领域占据了主导地位，并取得了显着进展。随后，大规模预训练语言模型（PLMs）将关系抽取的最新技术推向了一个新的高度。本文综述了现有深度学习技术在关系抽取中的应用情况。首先，我们介绍了关系抽取资源，包括关系抽取数据集和评估指标。其次，我们提出了一个新的分类法，从文本表示、上下文编码和三元组预测三个方面对现有工作进行分类。第三，我们讨论了关系抽取面临的一些重要挑战，并总结了可能应对这些挑战的技术。最后，我们概述了一些具有潜在前景的未来方向和展望。",
