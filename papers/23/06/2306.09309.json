    "abstract": "To optimally coordinate with others in cooperative games, it is often crucial to have information about one's collaborators: successful driving requires understanding which side of the road to drive on.

We show that there is a well-defined dichotomy between strategically relevant and irrelevant information.

    "translated_abstract": "在合作游戏中与他人进行最佳协调时，了解合作伙伴的信息通常是至关重要的：成功驾驶要求了解在哪一侧驾驶。然而，并非合作伙伴的每个特征在战略上都是相关的：在保持最佳协调的同时，可以忽略驾驶者的精细加速度。我们展示了战略相关和不相关信息之间存在明确定义的二分法。此外，我们还展示，在动态游戏中，这种二分法具有可通过Bellman备份运算符高效计算的紧凑表示。我们将此算法应用于分析标准和部分可观察的Overcooked环境中任务的战略相关信息。理论和实证结果表明，我们的算法比基线方法显著更高效。视频可在https://minknowledge.github.io上获得。",

By proposing a dichotomy between strategically relevant and irrelevant information and a computational method using Bellman backup operator, the authors demonstrate that strategically relevant information can be efficiently determined in dynamic games.
