    "translated_abstract": "研究表明，学习者在产生解释以支持他们的推理过程时，对学习有积极影响。然而，提供学习者实时的解释性反馈常常面临与分类准确性相关的挑战，特别是在包含复杂和微妙的情境响应的领域专用环境中。我们提出了两种方法，在在线课程中为导师提供有关如何给学生有效赞扬的实时反馈。这项进行中的工作在纠正性反馈（F1分数=0.811）和成果导向反馈（F1分数=0.350）的二分类方面表现出了相当高的准确性。更重要的是，我们引入了利用大型语言模型的命名实体识别来提供解释性反馈的改进方法，这不仅可以在课程中为导师提供反馈，还可以潜在地提出实时措施。",

Two approaches are introduced to provide real-time feedback on how to give students effective praise in online lessons. The use of named entity recognition facilitated by large language models is emphasized as an enhanced approach for providing explanatory feedback."
