    "translated_abstract": "尽管AI社区最近努力朝着标准化程序的方向发展，以记录模型、方法、系统或数据集，但目前尚无方法专注于与欧洲AI法案（AI法案）的基于风险的方法对齐的用例。在本文中，我们基于统一标记语言（UML）标准中包括的用例建模，提出了一种新的用例文档化框架，称为\"用例卡\"。与其他文档方法不同，我们专注于AI系统的预期目的和操作用途。它由两个主要部分组成。第一部分是基于UML的模板，旨在隐式评估AI系统的风险水平并定义相关要求。第二个部分是一个支持UML的图，旨在提供有关系统用户交互和关系的信息。所提出的框架是涉及欧盟政策专家和学者的协同设计过程的结果。",
