    "translated_abstract": "调制分类是信号处理中的一个重要步骤，在通信领域得到广泛应用。由于频率随时间变化对于不同调制格式的无线电信号仍然是一个重要的区别，因此可以通过将1-D无线电信号转换成频域来进行特征提取。本文提出了一种通过生成十一种不同调制类型的频谱图像，利用卷积神经网络（CNN）的现代架构来进行自动调制分类（AMC）的方案。此外，我们对频谱图进行分辨率转换，导致计算负载减少了多达99.61％，从接收到的I/Q数据转换速度加快了8倍。该AMC方案在CPU和GPU上实现，用于识别数字和模拟信号调制方案。性能评估基于现有的CNN模型，包括SqueezeNet、Resnet-50和InceptionR。",
