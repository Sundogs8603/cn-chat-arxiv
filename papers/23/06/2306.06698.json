    "translated_abstract": "生物等效性研究是一种比较两种不同药物配方生物等效性的临床试验。在此类研究中，通常会对随机分配给接受两种配方的人体试验对象的药物动力学特征进行比较。根据美国食品和药品管理局（FDA）的指导，对于一个大小为$\\alpha$的生物等价性检验，标准做法是构建一个$100(1-2\\alpha)\\%$置信区间，并验证置信区间是否落在关键区间内。本文阐明了在TOST中两个单侧检验“等尾”时，用$100(1-2\\alpha)\\%$置信区间的方法进行生物等效性检验只能得到一个大小为$\\alpha$的检验。此外，在生物等效性测试环境中，还讨论了一种$100(1-\\alpha)\\%$置信区间的方法，可以提供比标准方法更详细的推断。",
