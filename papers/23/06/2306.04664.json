    "translated_abstract": "正电子发射断层扫描（PET）是一种重要的功能医学成像技术，常用于评估某些脑部疾病，其重建问题是无论是否实际的。PET成像中绝大多数重建方法，包括迭代方法和深度学习方法，都会返回单个估计值而不量化关联的不确定性。由于无法确定性和噪声，单个解决方案可能会误导或不准确。因此，在PET图像重建中提供不确定性的度量可以帮助医务人员做出关键决策。本文提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，通过后验采样量化PET图像重建中的不确定性。该方法基于训练一种条件生成对抗网络，其生成器近似于在贝叶斯反演的后验中进行采样。 生成器是在传统重建方法获得的低剂量PET扫描和同一受试者的高质量磁共振（MR）图像的重建的条件下进行的。该方法在模拟数据和实际数据上进行了评估，并与其他不确定性评估方法进行了比较。结果表明，与其他方法相比，所提出的方法提供了更准确的不确定性估计和更好的重建质量。",
