    "translated_abstract": "多模态大语言模型（MLLM）是一种新兴的研究热点，使用强大的大语言模型作为大脑执行多模态任务。MLLM 的惊人能力，如基于图像编写故事和无OCR数学推理等，在传统方法中很少见，表明了通向人工智能的潜在路径。本文旨在追踪和总结 MLLM 的最新进展。首先，我们介绍了 MLLM 的构成，概述了相关概念。然后，讨论了关键技术和应用，包括多模态指令调整（M-IT）、多模态上下文学习（M-ICL）、多模态思维链（M-CoT）和LLM辅助视觉推理（LAVR）。最后，我们讨论了现有的挑战，并指出了有前途的研究方向。鉴于 MLLM 时代才刚刚开始，我们会不断更新这个综述，并希望能激发更多的研究。",
