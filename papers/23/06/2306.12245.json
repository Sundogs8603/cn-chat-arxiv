    "translated_abstract": "实体链接（EL）是信息提取和知识图谱的基本任务，它的一般形式（即端到端EL）旨在首先在给定输入文档中找到提及，并将提及链接到特定知识库中的相应实体。最近，检索器-阅读器范式促进了端到端EL的进展，受益于密集的实体检索和机器阅读理解的优势。然而，现有研究仅以流水线方式单独训练检索器和阅读器，忽略了检索器和阅读器之间交互带来的益处。为了使检索器-阅读器范式更完美地执行端到端EL，我们提出了BEER$^2$，一种用于Retriever and Reader的双向端到端训练框架。通过我们设计的双向端到端训练，BEER$^2$指导检索器和阅读器互相学习，共同进步，并最终实现端到端EL。",
