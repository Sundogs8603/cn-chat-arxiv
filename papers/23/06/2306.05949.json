We move toward a standard approach in evaluating a generative AI system for any modality, in two overarching categories: what is able to be evaluated in a base system that has no predetermined application and what is able to be evaluated in society.

    "translated_abstract": "生成AI系统跨越文本、图像、音频、视频等多种模态，具有广泛的社会影响，但目前不存在官方标准来评估这些影响和应该评估哪些影响。本文提出了一种标准方法来评估任何模态的生成AI系统，分为两大类别：对于没有预定应用的基础系统可以评估什么，以及可以在社会中评估什么。我们描述了具体的社会影响类别以及如何评估基础技术系统、人民和社会。我们的基础系统框架定义了七个社会影响类别：偏见、刻板印象和表现性伤害；文化价值和敏感内容；不对等的性能；隐私和数据保护；财务成本；环境成本；以及数据和内容监管劳动成本。建议的评估方法适用于所有模态和分析。",
