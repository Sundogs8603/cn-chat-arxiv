    "translated_abstract": "随着Twitter和微博等社交媒体的快速发展，从大量实时文本数据流中检测关键词已成为一个关键的问题。关键词检测问题旨在从海量文本数据中搜索重要信息以反映最重要的事件或话题。然而，社交媒体数据通常具有独特的特点：文档通常很短，语言口语化，并且数据很可能具有重要的时间模式。因此，从这些文本流中发现关键信息可能是具有挑战性的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法来解决社交媒体中的关键词检测问题。我们的模型将逆文档频率（IDF）和潜在狄利克雷分配（LDA）模型结合起来，以更好地应对社交媒体数据的不同属性，如点赞数、评论数和转发数。通过基于这些属性对每个文档的重要性进行加权，我们的方法可以有效地过滤噪声并识别最相关的关键词。我们在中国流行的微博平台上测试了我们的模型，实验结果表明，我们的方法在精确度、召回率和F1得分方面优于基准模型。",

The experimental results on Sina Weibo show that the proposed method outperforms baseline models in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score."
