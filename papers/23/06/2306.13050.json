    "abstract": "Collaborative filtering (CF) has become a popular method for developing recommender systems (RS) where ratings of a user for new items is predicted based on her past preferences and available preference information of other users. Despite the popularity of CF-based methods, their performance is often greatly limited by the sparsity of observed entries. In this study, we explore the data augmentation and refinement aspects of Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF), a widely accepted CF technique for the rating predictions, which have not been investigated before. We exploit the inherent characteristics of CF algorithms to assess the confidence level of individual ratings and propose a semi-supervised approach for rating augmentation based on self-training. We hypothesize that any CF algorithm's predictions with low confidence are due to some deficiency in the training data and hence, the performance of the algorithm can be improved by adopting a systematic data augmentation strategy",

    "translated_abstract": "协同过滤已成为推荐系统开发的常用方法，其中，根据用户的过去喜好和其他用户的可用偏好信息预测其对新物品的评分。尽管CF方法很受欢迎，但其性能通常受观察到的条目的稀疏性的极大限制。本研究探讨最大边际矩阵分解（MMMF）的数据增广和细化方面，该方法是广泛接受的用于评级预测的CF技术，之前尚未进行研究。我们利用CF算法的固有特性来评估单个评分的置信度，并提出了一种基于自我训练的半监督评级增强方法。我们假设任何CF算法的预测低置信度是由于训练数据的某些不足，因此，通过采用系统的数据增广策略，可以提高算法的性能。",
