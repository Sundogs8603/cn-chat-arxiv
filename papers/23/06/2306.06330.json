    "abstract": "Near the limits of adhesion, the forces generated by a tire are nonlinear and intricately coupled. Efficient and accurate modelling in this region could improve safety, especially in emergency situations where high forces are required. To this end, we propose a novel family of tire force models based on neural ordinary differential equations and a neural-ExpTanh parameterization. These models are designed to satisfy physically insightful assumptions while also having sufficient fidelity to capture higher-order effects directly from vehicle state measurements. They are used as drop-in replacements for an analytical brush tire model in an existing nonlinear model predictive control framework. Experiments with a customized Toyota Supra show that scarce amounts of driving data -- less than three minutes -- is sufficient to achieve high-performance autonomous drifting on various trajectories with speeds up to 45mph. Comparisons with the benchmark model show a $4 \\times$ improvement in track",

    "translated_abstract": "在附着极限附近，轮胎所产生的力是非线性和错综复杂的。在这个区域内高效、准确的建模可以提高安全性，特别是在需要高力的紧急情况下。为此，我们提出了一种基于神经常微分方程和神经-ExpTanh参数化的新型轮胎力模型。这些模型旨在满足物理洞察力假设，同时具有足够的保真度，以直接从车辆状态测量中捕捉高阶效应。它们被用作现有非线性模型预测控制框架中解析刷式轮胎模型的替代品。通过使用Toyota Supra上的实验表明，少于三分钟的驾驶数据足以在各种轨迹上实现高性能的自主漂移，最高速度可达45mph。与基准模型的比较显示轨迹提高了4倍。",
