    "abstract": "Unsupervised text style transfer task aims to rewrite a text into target style while preserving its main content. Traditional methods rely on the use of a fixed-sized vector to regulate text style, which is difficult to accurately convey the style strength for each individual token. In fact, each token of a text contains different style intensity and makes different contribution to the overall style. Our proposed method addresses this issue by assigning individual style vector to each token in a text, allowing for fine-grained control and manipulation of the style strength. Additionally, an adversarial training framework integrated with teacher-student learning is introduced to enhance training stability and reduce the complexity of high-dimensional optimization. The results of our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method in terms of clearly improved style transfer accuracy and content preservation in both two-style transfer and multi-style transfer settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "无监督文本风格转移任务旨在将文本重写为目标风格，同时保留其主要内容。传统方法依赖于使用固定大小的向量来调节文本风格，这很难准确传达每个单独令牌的风格强度。事实上，文本的每个令牌都包含不同的风格强度，并对整体风格产生不同的贡献。我们提出的方法通过为文本中的每个令牌分配单独的风格向量来解决这个问题，允许对风格强度进行细粒度的控制和操作。此外，我们引入了一个基于教师-学生学习的对抗性培训框架，以增强培训稳定性并减轻高维优化的复杂性。我们实验的结果证明了我们的方法在双风格转换和多风格转换设置中，具有明显提高的风格转换准确性和内容保留的效果。",
