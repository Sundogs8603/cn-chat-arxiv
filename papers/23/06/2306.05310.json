    "abstract": "While Deep Reinforcement Learning has been widely researched in medical imaging, the training and deployment of these models usually require powerful GPUs. Since imaging environments evolve rapidly and can be generated by edge devices, the algorithm is required to continually learn and adapt to changing environments, and adjust to low-compute devices. To this end, we developed three image coreset algorithms to compress and denoise medical images for selective experience replayed-based lifelong reinforcement learning. We implemented neighborhood averaging coreset, neighborhood sensitivity-based sampling coreset, and maximum entropy coreset on full-body DIXON water and DIXON fat MRI images. All three coresets produced 27x compression with excellent performance in localizing five anatomical landmarks: left knee, right trochanter, left kidney, spleen, and lung across both imaging environments. Maximum entropy coreset obtained the best performance of $11.97\\pm 12.02$ average distance error,",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管Deep Reinforcement Learning在医学影像方面得到广泛研究，但这些模型的训练和部署通常需要强大的GPU。由于影像环境的快速演变和边缘设备的普及，算法需要持续学习和适应不断变化的环境，为低计算设备进行适配。为此，我们开发了三种图像核心算法，以对选择性经验回放强化学习的医学图像进行压缩和去噪。我们在全身DIXON水和DIXON脂肪MRI图像上实施了邻域平均核心算法、邻域灵敏度采样核心算法和最大熵核心算法。所有三种核心算法都能够以27倍的压缩率在两种成像环境下定位5个解剖标志：左膝、右转子、左肾、脾脏和肺。最大熵核心算法在平均距离误差方面获得了最佳表现，为$11.97\\pm12.02$。",
