    "translated_abstract": "编码用户活动以进行下一步行动预测的序列模型已成为构建大规模个性化推荐系统的常见设计选择。 传统的序列推荐方法要么利用实时用户操作进行端到端学习，要么以脱机批量生成的方式单独学习用户表示。 本文(1)介绍了Pinterest Homefeed的排名架构，即我们的个性化推荐产品和最大的参与面；(2)提出了TransAct，一种从用户实时活动中提取短期偏好的序列模型；(3)描述了我们的混合排名方法，即通过TransAct的端到端序列建模与批量生成的用户嵌入混合。 混合方法允许我们结合直接在实时用户活动上学习以获得响应性的优点和在较长时间段内学习的批量用户表示的成本效益。 我们描述了实验结果......（原文内容省略）",
