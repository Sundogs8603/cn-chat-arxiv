    "abstract": "The vast majority of work on gender in MT focuses on 'unambiguous' inputs, where gender markers in the source language are expected to be resolved in the output. Conversely, this paper explores the widespread case where the source sentence lacks explicit gender markers, but the target sentence contains them due to richer grammatical gender. We particularly focus on inputs containing person names.  Investigating such sentence pairs casts a new light on research into MT gender bias and its mitigation. We find that many name-gender co-occurrences in MT data are not resolvable with 'unambiguous gender' in the source language, and that gender-ambiguous examples can make up a large proportion of training examples. From this, we discuss potential steps toward gender-inclusive translation which accepts the ambiguity in both gender and translation.",

    "translated_abstract": "MT（机器翻译）中关于性别的大多数工作都集中在“明确性”输入上，即源语言中的性别标记应在输出中得到解决。相反，本文探讨了源句子缺乏显式性别标记，但目标句子含有更丰富语法性别的普遍情况。我们特别关注包含人名的输入。研究这些句子对揭示了MT性别偏见及其缓解的新认识。我们发现，MT数据中的许多姓名-性别共现并不能通过源语言的“明确性别”来解决，并且性别不明确的例子可以占到大部分训练数据。基于此，我们讨论了接受性别和翻译上的模糊性，朝向包容性别的翻译的潜在步骤。",
