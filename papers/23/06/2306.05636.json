Critiquing is a well-known paradigm for CRS that allows users to iteratively refine recommendations by providing feedback about attributes of recommended items.

    "translated_abstract": "会话式推荐系统增强了推荐的表现力和个性化程度，通过多轮用户-系统交互进行。批判是CRS中广为人知的一个范例，允许用户通过提供有关推荐物品的属性的反馈来逐步完善推荐。本研究利用知识图谱中有关物品的更丰富的背景信息，不仅限于利用物品的直接属性解决用户请求，而是通过采用经典的推理方法将这些信息与直接属性结合起来。因此批判式推荐系统可以实现更加复杂的基于知识的反馈，例如“我喜欢描述退伍军人战争后果的电影”。本文提出了一个基于贝叶斯知识的批判式推荐模型，该模型允许用户提供带有间接信息的反馈，同时仍具有很高的可解释性。实验结果表明，纳入间接信息显着提高了推荐的质量和模型的鲁棒性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a knowledge-driven critiquing framework based on the Knowledge Graph, which combines the direct and indirect attributes of items to allow users to provide more complex, knowledge-based feedback. The experimental results show that incorporating indirect evidence significantly improves the quality of recommendations and the robustness of the model."
