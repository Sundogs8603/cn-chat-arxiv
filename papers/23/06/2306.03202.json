    "translated_abstract": "本文关注一类分布鲁棒优化（DRO）问题，其中目标函数在分布上可能是非线性的，这与现有的文献有所不同。为解决在概率空间中优化非线性函数面临的理论和计算挑战，我们提出了一种Derivative和相应的平滑度概念，基于Gateaux Derivative来处理一般风险度量。我们通过Var、entropic risk和有限支持集上的三个运行风险度量示例来解释这些概念。然后，我们为概率空间中一般非线性优化问题提出了一种基于G-derivative的Frank-Wolfe（FW）算法，并以完全独立于范数的方式推导出其收敛性在提出的平滑度概念下。我们利用FW算法的设置来设计一种计算非线性DRO问题鞍点的方法。我们通过数值实验展示了我们方法处理分布的非线性目标函数的成功。",
