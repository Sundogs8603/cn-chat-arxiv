We introduce the VISION Datasets, a diverse collection of 14 industrial inspection datasets, uniquely poised to meet these challenges. Unlike previous datasets, VISION brings versatility to defect detection, offering annotation masks across all splits and catering to various detection methodologies. Our datasets also feature instance-segmentation annotation, enabling precise defect identification. With a total of 18k images encompassing 44 defect types, VISION strives to mirror a wide range of real-world production scenarios. By supporting two ongoing challenge competitions on the VISION Datasets, we hope to foster further advancements in vision-based industrial inspection.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管基于视觉的检测算法取得了一定的进展，但现实世界中工业挑战——特别是数据可用性、质量和复杂的生产要求——往往仍未得到解决。我们介绍了VISION数据集，这是一个包含14个不同工业领域检测数据集的多元化集合，独具优势可以应对这些挑战。与以往的数据集不同，VISION为缺陷检测提供丰富的数据，包括所有数据分类的注释掩模，并且适用于多种检测方法。我们的数据集还具有实例分割注释功能，可以精确地识别缺陷。VISION通过提供18000张图像，包含44种缺陷类型，致力于反映出各种现实工业生产场景。通过支持VISION数据集上两个正在进行的竞赛，我们希望促进基于视觉的工业检测的进一步发展。",
