The problem of data attribution in such models -- which of the images in the training set are most responsible for the appearance of a given generated image -- is a difficult yet important one. As an initial step toward this problem, we evaluate attribution through \"customization\" methods, which tune an existing large-scale model toward a given exemplar object or style. Our key insight is that this allows us to efficiently create synthetic images that are computationally influenced by the exemplar by construction. With our new dataset of such exemplar-influenced images, we are able to evaluate various data attribution algorithms and different possible feature spaces.

    "translated_abstract": "虽然大型文本到图像模型能够合成“新颖”的图像，但这些图像必然是训练数据的反映。在这种模型中，数据归因的问题——在训练集中哪些图像对于生成的图像外观最负责——是一个困难但重要的问题。作为该问题的初步步骤，我们通过“定制”方法来评估归因，该方法将现有的大规模模型调整到给定的典型对象或风格。我们的关键见解是，这样可以通过构造有效地创建受典型对象影响的合成图像。通过我们的新数据集，我们可以评估各种数据归因算法和不同可能的特征空间。此外，通过在我们的数据集上进行训练，我们可以让DINO、CLIP和ViT等标准模型针对归因问题进行调整。",
