    "translated_abstract": "全局特征效应方法，如偏依赖图，提供了预期边际特征效应的可理解的可视化。但是，当存在特征交互作用时，这种全局特征效应方法可能会误导，因为它们不能很好地表示单个观测的局部特征效应。我们正式介绍了基于递归分区的全局效应广义可加分解（GADGET）框架，以找到解释性特征空间中的可解释区域，从而最小化本地特征效应的交互异质性。我们为该框架提供了数学基础，并展示它适用于最流行的方法来可视化边际特征效应，即偏依赖，积累局部效应和Shapley可加解释（SHAP）依赖。此外，我们引入了一种新的基于置换的交互测试来检测显着的特征交互作用，该方法适用于任何特征。",
