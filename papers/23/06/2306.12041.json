    "abstract": "We propose an efficient abnormal event detection model based on a lightweight masked auto-encoder (AE) applied at the video frame level. The novelty of the proposed model is threefold. First, we introduce an approach to weight tokens based on motion gradients, thus avoiding learning to reconstruct the static background scene. Second, we integrate a teacher decoder and a student decoder into our architecture, leveraging the discrepancy between the outputs given by the two decoders to improve anomaly detection. Third, we generate synthetic abnormal events to augment the training videos, and task the masked AE model to jointly reconstruct the original frames (without anomalies) and the corresponding pixel-level anomaly maps. Our design leads to an efficient and effective model, as demonstrated by the extensive experiments carried out on three benchmarks: Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UCSD Ped2. The empirical results show that our model achieves an excellent trade-off between speed and accuracy",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于轻量级遮蔽自编码器（AE）的高效异常事件检测模型，该模型应用于视频帧级别。我们的模型的三个创新点：其一，我们引入了基于运动梯度的令牌加权方法，因此避免了学习重构静态背景场景。其二，我们将教师解码器和学生解码器整合到我们的架构中，利用两个解码器给出的输出之间的差异来改善异常检测。其三，我们生成合成异常事件以增强培训视频，并将遮蔽AE模型任务设置为共同重构原始帧（无异常）和对应的像素级异常映射。我们的设计导致高效和有效的模型，通过对三个基准测试进行的广泛实验证明。实验结果显示，我们的模型在速度和准确性之间实现了出色的权衡。",
