    "translated_abstract": "基于网络计算（COIN）范式是一个利用未使用的网络资源来执行某些任务以满足计算密集型应用程序（如Metaverse）的有前途的解决方案。在此基础上，我们考虑在COIN环境中针对Metaverse的多个子任务的部分计算卸载问题，以在动态调整卸载策略的同时最小化能耗和延迟。我们证明了该问题是NP难题，将其转化为两个子问题：用户端的任务切分问题（TSP）和COIN端的任务卸载问题（TOP）。我们将TSP建模为序数潜在博弈（OPG），并提出了一种分散算法来获取其纳什平衡（NE）。然后，我们将TOP建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），提出了双重深度Q网络（DDQN）来解决最优卸载策略的问题。与传统的DDQN算法不同，智能代理在此不以随机方式抽样卸载决策",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a dynamic partial computation offloading solution for Metaverse based on in-network computing, which minimizes energy consumption and delay while dynamically adjusting the offloading policy. It solves the problem of partial computation offloading for multiple subtasks and decomposes it into two subproblems, namely, task splitting problem (TSP) on the user side and task offloading problem (TOP) on the in-network computing (COIN) side. To solve these subproblems, the paper uses ordinal potential game (OPG), Markov Decision Process (MDP), and double deep Q-network (DDQN) models."
