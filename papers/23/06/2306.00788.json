    "translated_abstract": "好的数据增强是自监督表示学习（如对比学习和掩码语言建模）实现经验成功的关键因素之一，但其在学习好的表示方面的理论理解仍然有限。最近的工作建立了自监督学习和逼近图拉普拉斯算子的顶部特征空间之间的联系。在这项工作中，我们利用这一洞察力对基于增广的预训练进行统计分析。我们从保持等距的属性出发，这是由增强给出的目标函数的关键几何特征。我们的第一主要定理为任意编码器提供了接近紧密的上限，用于估计通过在编码器之上拟合线性探测器而产生的估计误差和编码器学习的RKHS的逼近误差。我们的第二个主要定理表明，在温和条件下，可以通过RKHS函数任意精确地逼近增广函数。这个结果意味着，随着增广函数质量的提高，学习的编码器的表示能力也会提高。我们的分析还揭示了自监督学习中批量归一化和数据增强的作用。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper uses the RKHS approximation method to reveal the importance of good data augmentation in self-supervised representation learning, and explains that improving the quality of the augmentation function can enhance the representational power of the learned encoder for any encoder, sheds light on the role of batch normalization and data augmentation in self-supervised learning."
