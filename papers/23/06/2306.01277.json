    "translated_abstract": "主动学习是一种人类参与的框架，可交互地和适应性地标记数据实例，从而使得模型性能比随机采样得到了显著提升。主动学习方法通过选择难以标注的实例来起作用，通常依赖于多样性和不确定性。然而，我们认为目前的这些主动学习范例没有充分利用自动标注建议所赋予的人类交互的全部潜力。实际上，我们证明对于许多分类任务和数据集，多数人在验证自动建议标签的正确性时所需时间为更正不正确的建议到正确标签（或不使用任何建议进行标注）所需时间的3到4倍。利用这个结果，我们提出了CLARIFIER（来自分层难度的主动学习），它是一个交互式学习框架，通过利用验证成本的降低，更有效地利用人类交互。",
