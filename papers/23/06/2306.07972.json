    "translated_abstract": "自2008年比特币推出以来，随着无需许可的区块链的出现，人们意识到它们最适合的用例与使金融系统及其优势可供每个人无缝使用而无需依赖任何受信任的中介有关。跨链智能合约提供了一个去中心化金融（DeFi）生态系统，用户可以与借贷池、自动市场制造商（AMM）交易所、稳定币、衍生品等进行交互，其累计锁定价值已超过1600亿美元。尽管DeFi带来了高额回报，但也带来了许多风险。多年来发生了许多金融罪案，使得恶意活动的早期检测成为了高度优先考虑的问题。该提议框架介绍了一种有效的方法，从不同链中提取一组功能，包括最大的以太坊，并使用我们收集的最广泛DeFi协议的交易数据集进行评估（23个）。",
