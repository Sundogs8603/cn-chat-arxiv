    "abstract": "In recent years, in-silico molecular design has received much attention from the machine learning community. When designing a new compound for pharmaceutical applications, there are usually multiple properties of such molecules that need to be optimised: binding energy to the target, synthesizability, toxicity, EC50, and so on. While previous approaches have employed a scalarization scheme to turn the multi-objective problem into a preference-conditioned single objective, it has been established that this kind of reduction may produce solutions that tend to slide towards the extreme points of the objective space when presented with a problem that exhibits a concave Pareto front. In this work we experiment with an alternative formulation of goal-conditioned molecular generation to obtain a more controllable conditional model that can uniformly explore solutions along the entire Pareto front.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，机器学习领域对于原子分子设计的关注逐渐加剧。在设计药物应用的新化合物时，通常需要优化分子的多个属性，如与目标的结合能、可合成性、毒性、EC50等等。以往的方法采用标量化方案将多目标问题转化为以偏好为条件的单个目标，但已经确定，在具有凹形Pareto前沿的问题上，这种减少方案可能会导致解决方案倾向于滑向目标空间的极端点。本研究中，我们通过另一种目标条件分子生成公式进行实验，以获得更可控的条件模型，以便沿整个Pareto前沿均匀探索解决方案。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了在多属性优化问题中，一种更好的，基于目标条件下的分子设计模型，以此解决现有标量化方案所无法解决的问题。",
