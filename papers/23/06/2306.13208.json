    "abstract": "We measure the extent of consumption insurance to income shocks accounting for high-order moments of the income distribution. We derive a nonlinear consumption function, in which the extent of insurance varies with the sign and magnitude of income shocks. Using PSID data, we estimate an asymmetric pass-through of bad versus good permanent shocks -- 17% of a 3 sigma negative shock transmits to consumption compared to 9% of an equal-sized positive shock -- and the pass-through increases as the shock worsens. Our results are consistent with surveys of consumption responses to hypothetical events and suggest that tail income risk matters substantially for consumption.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们通过考虑收入分布高阶矩的影响，衡量了收入冲击对消费保险的影响程度。我们导出了一个非线性消费函数，其中保险程度随着收入冲击的符号和大小而变化。利用PSID数据，我们估计了坏的相对于好的永久性冲击的非对称传导率-- 3 sigma负冲击的的17%传导到消费，而相同大小的正冲击只有9%传导到消费-- 随着冲击恶化，传导率增加。我们的结果与对假想事件消费反应的调查一致，并表明尾部收入风险对消费具有重要影响。",
    "tldr": "该研究测量了收入冲击对消费保险的影响程度，证实尾部收入风险对消费具有重要影响，收入负面冲击对消费的传导率大于正面冲击。",
