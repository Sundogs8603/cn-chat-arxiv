    "translated_abstract": "大多数6自由度的定位和SLAM系统使用静态地标，但忽略动态物体，因为它们无法有用地纳入到典型的流程中。在已经纳入动态物体的情况下，典型的方法尝试着相对复杂地识别和定位这些物体，限制了它们的鲁棒性或通用性。在这项研究中，我们提出了一个折中的方法，在自动驾驶车辆的背景下进行演示，利用动态车辆在6自由度逐帧PnP-RANSAC定位流程中提供有限的姿态约束信息。我们通过运动模型对初始姿态估计进行优化，并提出了一种计算未来姿态估计质量的方法，根据自动驾驶车辆在环境中相对帧间位置的运动是否受到动态车辆的约束来触发。我们的方法检测和识别适合的动态车辆来定义这些姿态约束，以修改姿态。",

By incorporating limited pose constraint information from dynamic vehicles, refining pose estimates, and calculating the quality of future pose estimates, the proposed approach enhances the robustness and accuracy of localization in the context of autonomous vehicles."
