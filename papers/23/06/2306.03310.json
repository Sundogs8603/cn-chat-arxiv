    "translated_abstract": "终身学习提供了一种建立通用代理的有前途的范例，该代理在其生命周期内学习和适应。与传统的图像和文本领域的终身学习问题不同，决策制定中的终身学习（LLDM）还需要传递程序化知识，例如操作和行为。为了推进LLDM研究，我们介绍了LIBERO，这是一个新颖的机器人操作终身学习基准测试。具体而言，LIBERO强调了LLDM中的五个关键研究主题：1）如何有效地传递声明性知识、程序性知识或二者混合体；2）如何设计有效的策略架构和3）LLDM的有效算法；4）终身学习者在任务排序方面的稳健性；5）模型预训练对LLDM的影响。我们开发了一个可扩展的程序生成管道，可以原则上生成无限多的转移场景。基准测试套件包括5个任务族中的50个不同任务。每个任务族都设计以测试其中一个五个研究主题，而在每个任务族内，任务的难度和新颖程度各不相同。我们的实验表明，任务排序对终身学习者的表现有重要影响，而模型预训练可以有效缓解任务排序的负面影响。我们希望LIBERO能够作为一个社区范围的测试平台，用于研究LLDM并加速构建可以在其生命周期内学习和适应的通用代理的进展。",
