    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能应用到了许多领域，将AI应用于体育分析也受到了关注。然而，自动获取运动比赛中连续运动数据的难度是主要挑战之一。特别是，在一个有障碍物如遮挡和干扰的宽广足球场上可靠地跟踪一个小球是难以解决的难题。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种从球员轨迹推断球的轨迹的推断框架，作为球追踪的一种经济实用的替代方法。我们结合了集合变换器来获得多智能体环境的置换不变和等变表示，并采用分层架构，中间预测球员拥有权以支持最终的轨迹推断。此外，我们引入了现实损失项和后处理来确保估计轨迹的物理合理性。实验结果表明，我们的模型提供了自然和准确的多智能体运动环境翻译，并使得即使在复杂的情况下也能成功预测球的轨迹。",
