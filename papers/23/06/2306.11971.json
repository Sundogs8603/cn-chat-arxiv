    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新的强化学习基准环境—— AdCraft，其具有随机和非静态特性。该环境模拟了搜索引擎营销中出价和预算的动态变化。SEM是一种利用付费广告来增加网站在搜索引擎结果页面上的可见性的数字营销技术。SEM广告活动的表现取决于多个因素，包括关键字选择、广告设计、出价管理、预算调整和表现监控。深度强化学习最近被认为是一种优化SEM广告投放活动的潜在策略，但需要大量数据，在实践中可能成本高昂或不可行。我们的可定制环境使从业者能够评估和提高与SEM出价和预算管理相关的RL算法的鲁棒性，而无需付出这些成本。通过在AdCraft环境下进行一系列实验，",
