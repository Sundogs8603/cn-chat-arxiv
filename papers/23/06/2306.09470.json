    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的方法来加速路径规划任务，该任务在未知场景与障碍中利用带有渐变惩罚（GP）的Wasserstein生成对抗性网络（WGANs）来近似自由条件配置空间的分布。我们的方法将WGAN-GP与连续潜在空间中的变分自动编码器结合起来，以处理多模态数据集。但是，使用WGAN-GP训练变分自动编码器可能对于从图像到配置空间的问题具有挑战性，因为KL损失函数通常会收敛到一个随机分布。为了解决这个问题，我们将配置空间简化为一组高斯分布，并将数据集划分为几个本地模型。这使我们不仅可以学习模型，还可以加速其收敛。我们使用流形的同调秩和几何得分评估重构的配置空间。此外，我们提出了一种新颖的评估指标，用于度量本地批评者在为多模态Wasserstein生成对抗性网络with Gradient Penalty提供反馈方面的有效性。实验结果表明，我们的方法在路径规划速度和成功率方面优于现有的最先进方法。",
