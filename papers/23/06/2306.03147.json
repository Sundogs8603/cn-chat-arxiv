    "translated_abstract": "弦理论景象包括多个标准模型的紫外嵌入，但由于可用的弦紧致化数量巨大，因此识别这些嵌入变得困难。遗传算法（GAs）代表了一类强大的离散优化技术，可以有效处理弦景象的广袤空间，特别是当它与量子退火的输入结合时。本文关注于异构$E_8\\times E_8$弦论在光滑Calabi-Yau三叠上的几何紧致化与阿贝尔丛。我们利用丛值上同调的解析公式，以满足整个谱要求的所有范围，这是迄今为止不可能的。对于具有相对较少Kahler参数的流形，我们将GA搜索结果与以前系统性扫描的结果进行比较，显示出GA可以找到几乎所有可行的解决方案，同时只访问了微小的一部分搜索空间。我们展示了GAs如何能够很好地与量子退火结合，以处理高维空间和高度非线性函数的优化搜索问题，并能够找到尚未从系统扫描中发现的新解中的困难实例，这使得GAs成为大规模天然扫描中的有力工具。",
