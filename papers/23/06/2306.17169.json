    "translated_abstract": "磁盘刷新是一种通过从磁盘读取数据来解决读错误的过程。然而，一次性刷新整个存储数组可能会对系统性能产生不利影响，尤其是在高输入/输出操作期间。此外，刷新时连续从磁盘读取数据可能会导致磁盘的磨损，特别是对于更大容量的磁盘，因为这涉及到显著的时间和能量消耗。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种选择性磁盘刷新方法，提高数据中心的整体可靠性和功率效率。我们的方法基于Mondrian Conformal预测模型，通过预测存储池中每个磁盘的健康状态，提前n天进行预测，并使用开源数据集来识别需要刷新的特定磁盘。对于预测为不健康的磁盘，我们标记它们进行替换，无需进一步操作。对于健康的驱动器，我们创建一个集合和数量评估的指标",
