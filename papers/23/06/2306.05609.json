Our framework combines cognitive models of chaining with a learning scheme that transforms a language model embedding space to support various types of word sense extension.

    "translated_abstract": "人类常常用词语表达新颖的意思。自然语言处理领域长期以来一直在关注词义消岐（WSD），但对于如何将一个词的意义扩展至新的含义，却鲜有探索。我们提出了词义扩展（WSE）的范例，使词汇能够向新语境产生新的意义。我们开发了一个框架，它通过首先将多义词类型划分为两个伪记号以标记其不同的意义，然后推断一个伪符号的含义是否可以被扩展以传达来自同一词类型划分出的符号所表示的意义。我们的框架将链接的认知模型与学习方案相结合，从而转换一个语言模型嵌入空间以支持各种类型的词义扩展。我们针对几个竞争基线评估我们的框架，并表明它在预测新颖词义的可信翻译方面优于其他基线。",
