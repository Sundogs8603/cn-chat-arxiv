    "abstract": "We introduce a new proxy score for evaluating bitext mining based on similarity in a multilingual embedding space: xSIM++. In comparison to xSIM, this improved proxy leverages rule-based approaches to extend English sentences in any evaluation set with synthetic, hard-to-distinguish examples which more closely mirror the scenarios we encounter during large-scale mining. We validate this proxy by running a significant number of bitext mining experiments for a set of low-resource languages, and subsequently train NMT systems on the mined data. In comparison to xSIM, we show that xSIM++ is better correlated with the downstream BLEU scores of translation systems trained on mined bitexts, providing a reliable proxy of bitext mining performance without needing to run expensive bitext mining pipelines. xSIM++ also reports performance for different error types, offering more fine-grained feedback for model development.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一个新的代理评分来评估基于多语言嵌入空间相似性的比文本挖掘：xSIM++。相较于xSIM，这个改进的代理利用基于规则的方法，在任何评估集中扩展英语句子与合成的、难以区分的例子，这更接近于我们在大规模挖掘过程中遇到的场景。我们通过对一组低资源语言运行大量比文本挖掘实验，随后在挖掘的数据上训练神经机器翻译系统来验证这个代理。与xSIM相比，我们展示了xSIM++与训练于挖掘比文本的翻译系统下游BLEU评分之间更好的相关性，为了比文本挖掘性能提供了一个可靠的代理，无需运行昂贵的比文本挖掘管道。xSIM++还报告了不同错误类型的性能，为模型开发提供了更细致的反馈。",
