    "translated_abstract": "由于电磁和热约束的不同，感应电机的设计是一项具有挑战性的任务。在销售工具中快速估算机器的尺寸对于根据特定要求给客户提供快速报价非常重要。这个过程的关键部分是选择不同的设计参数，如长度、直径、齿尖高度和绕组匝数，以实现机器的特定扭矩、电流和温度。电机设计师通过他们的经验知道如何改变不同的机器设计参数，以满足客户的特定操作要求。我们提出了一种强化学习算法来设计定制的感应电动机。神经网络模型通过模拟电机设计游戏的不同实例进行离线训练，当做出良好或不良设计选择时，使用奖励或惩罚函数。结果表明，所提出的方法可以自动化电机设计，而无需应用任何人为制约。",
