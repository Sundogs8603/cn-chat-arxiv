    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍并评估了一门新的在线 AI 创意课程。该课程基于三个近乎最先进的 AI 模型，结合成了一个流行歌曲生成系统。经过微调的 GPT-2 模型编写歌词，Music-VAE 组合音乐乐谱和器乐，而 Diffsinger 则合成唱歌的声音。我们解释了设计课程所做的决定，基于 Piaget 的构造主义“学以致用”的理念。我们介绍了五周课程设计的细节，包括学习目标、技术概念以及创意和技术活动。我们解释了如何克服技术挑战，构建了一个完整的流行歌曲生成器系统，由 Python 脚本、预训练模型和通过基于 Web 的 IDE 在 docker 化 Linux 容器中运行的 Javascript 代码组成。通过对学生活动的定量分析提供了参考，并为未来改进提供了基准。专家工作坊的定性分析验证了整个课程的设计。",
    "tldr": "本研究介绍了一个新的在线AI创意课程，基于三个AI模型建立了流行歌曲生成系统。该课程采用Piaget构造主义理念的\"实践学习\"方法，通过详细的五周课程设计提升学生的技术和创作能力。通过定量和定性分析，可以生成一首流行歌曲。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study presents a new online AI creativity course, which builds a pop song generation system based on three AI models. The course adopts a Piagetian constructivist \"learning-by-doing\" method, and enhances students' technical and creative abilities through detailed five-week course design. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, a pop song can be generated."
