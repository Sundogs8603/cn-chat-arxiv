    "abstract": "Emerging psychopathology studies are showing that patterns of changes in emotional state -- emotion dynamics -- are associated with overall well-being and mental health. More recently, there has been some work in tracking emotion dynamics through one's utterances, allowing for data to be collected on a larger scale across time and people. However, several questions about how emotion dynamics change with age, especially in children, and when determined through children's writing, remain unanswered. In this work, we use both a lexicon and a machine learning based approach to quantify characteristics of emotion dynamics determined from poems written by children of various ages. We show that both approaches point to similar trends: consistent increasing intensities for some emotions (e.g., anger, fear, joy, sadness, arousal, and dominance) with age and a consistent decreasing valence with age. We also find increasing emotional variability, rise rates (i.e., emotional reactivity), and recov",

    "translated_abstract": "新兴的心理病理学研究表明，情感状态的变化模式——情感动态——与整体福祉和心理健康有关。最近，有一些工作在追踪情感动态，以便在时间和人群上收集数据。然而，关于情感动态如何随年龄变化，特别是在孩子们的写作中如何确定，仍有一些问题未得到解答。在本文中，我们使用词库和基于机器学习的方法来量化由不同年龄段儿童写的诗歌所确定的情感动态的特征。我们发现，两种方法都指向类似的趋势：某些情感（如愤怒、害怕、喜悦、悲伤、唤醒和支配）的强度随年龄增加而持续增加，而情感的基调随年龄降低而保持稳定。我们还发现随着年龄的增长，情感变异性、上升速率（即情感反应性）和恢复速率（即情感回复力）也在不断提高。我们的结果可以帮助未来情感动态的研究，并帮助确定儿童心理健康问题的可能前兆。",
    "tldr": "本文探讨了儿童诗歌中的话语情感动态，发现随着年龄增长，部分情感强度持续上升，情感基调持续下降，情感变异性、上升速率和恢复速率不断加强，并可为未来情感动态研究和儿童心理健康问题提供借鉴。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the dynamics of utterance emotions in children's poems and finds that with age, some emotions (such as anger, fear, joy, sadness, arousal, and dominance) consistently intensify while the valence consistently decreases. Emotional variability, rise rates, and recovery rates also increase with age, providing future research on emotion dynamics and potential precursors to mental health problems in children."
