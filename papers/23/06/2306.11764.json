    "translated_abstract": "机器学习中的一个主要挑战是训练数据与应用时数据之间的变化条件不同。该论文从声学情景分类的角度研究了在存在不匹配录音设备时如何有效地利用神经网络减少录音设备之间的差异。研究表明，在卷积神经网络的输入和隐藏层激活中进行频率归一化能够降低录音设备之间的差异，并显著提高模型的鲁棒性。本文研究了基于音频频谱变换的 AST 模型中，录音设备特征如何在隐藏层激活中表达，发现频率维度最初编码录音设备信息，但是经过第一次自注意力块后，它大部分被转换为令牌维度。基于这一观察结果，本文推测在频率维度抑制录音设备特征可能更好地推广AST模型到不匹配录音设备中。我们在多个声学情景分类数据集上进行了实验，结果表明频率归一化确实提高了AST模型在处理不同录音设备的数据时的准确度和稳健性比没有归一化的基线模型更高。",

The study shows that encoding recording device characteristics in the frequency dimension and suppressing them through normalization leads to higher accuracy and robustness on several datasets."
