    "translated_abstract": "最近，生成扩散模型（generative diffusion models）在深度生成模型领域取得了突破性成果，展现了在许多应用中的出色表现。与此同时，结构化数据（包括表格和时间序列数据）在深度学习研究界中受到的关注相对较少，尽管其无处不在且应用广泛。因此，与计算机视觉和自然语言处理等其他数据形式相比，利用扩散模型对结构化数据建模的文献及其综述仍然缺乏。因此，本文介绍了在结构化数据领域中最近提出的扩散模型的全面综述。首先，本综述提供了基于得分的扩散模型理论的简要概述，随后又详细描述了在数据驱动的通用任务和特定领域应用中使用结构化数据的大部分开创性工作的技术描述。最后，",
