    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了压缩感知问题，即找到最稀疏的向量，该向量满足一组线性测量，同时达到一定的数值容限。压缩感知是统计学、运筹学和机器学习中的核心问题，应用于信号处理、数据压缩和图像重建等领域。我们引入了一个带有$\\ell_2$正则化的压缩感知问题，将其作为混合整数二次锥规划来重新定义。我们推导出此问题的二次锥松弛，并展示了在正则化参数的温和限制下，得到的松弛等价于深入研究的基础追踪去噪问题。我们提出了一个半定松弛来加强二次锥松弛，开发了一种定制的分支定界算法，利用我们的二次锥松弛来解决压缩感知问题的实例，以确证的最优解。我们的数值结果表明，我们的方法产生的解决方案是精确的，并且优于其他方法。",
