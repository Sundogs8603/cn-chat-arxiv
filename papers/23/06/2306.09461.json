We develop the concept to a generalized form and prove its applicability to all types of hierarchical classification problems including directed acyclic graphs, multi path labelling, and non mandatory leaf node prediction. Finally, we use measures based on the novel confusion matrix to evaluate models within a benchmark for three real world hierarchical classification applications and compare the results to established evaluation measures.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个新颖的分级混淆矩阵的概念，为基于混淆矩阵的（平面）二分类问题评估措施，同时考虑了分级分类问题的特殊性。我们将该概念发展到一个广义形式，并证明其适用于所有类型的分级分类问题，包括有向无环图、多路径标记和非强制叶节点预测。最后，我们使用基于新混淆矩阵的度量方法来评估三个真实世界的分级分类应用程序中的模型，并将结果与已建立的评估度量方法进行比较。结果概述了这种方法的合理性及其用于评估分级分类问题的实用性。分级混淆矩阵的实现可在GitHub上获得。",
