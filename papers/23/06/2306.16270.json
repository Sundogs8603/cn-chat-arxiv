    "translated_abstract": "超导性能使得电流能够在没有能量损失的情况下流动，因此使固体材料具有超导性是物理学、材料科学和电气工程的一个重要目标。已经有16位诺贝尔奖得主因为其对超导性研究的贡献而获得了奖项。超导体对可持续发展目标（SDGs）具有重要价值，如应对气候变化、可负担得起的清洁能源、工业、创新和基础设施等方面。然而，目前仍没有一个统一的物理理论能够解释所有超导性机制。人们认为，超导性的微观机制不仅与分子组成有关，还与晶体结构有关。因此，在SuperCon和Material Project的基础上建立了一个新的数据集S2S，其中包含晶体结构和超导临界温度的信息。基于这个新数据集，我们提出了一种新颖的模型S2SNet，该模型利用了注意机制来进行超导性预测。",
