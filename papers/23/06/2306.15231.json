    "translated_abstract": "假新闻的广泛传播影响了我们生活的许多方面，因此假新闻检测变得非常重要并吸引了越来越多的关注。现有方法通过从单模态或多模态的角度对新闻进行建模，在这个领域做出了实质性的贡献。然而，这些基于模态的方法可能会导致次优的结果，因为它们忽略了读者在阅读新闻和验证真实性方面的行为。举例来说，它们没有考虑到按部分进行阅读的过程：从标题、图片、评论到正文，这对于更细致地建模新闻至关重要。为此，我们提出了一种模拟读者行为的方法（Ember）用于社交媒体上的假新闻检测，将读者的阅读和验证过程纳入对组件角度全面建模的新闻模型中。具体而言，我们首先构建了内部组件特征提取器，以模拟对每个组件进行语义分析的行为。",

By incorporating readers' reading and verification process and modeling news from a component perspective, it aims to improve the effectiveness and authenticity of fake news detection."
