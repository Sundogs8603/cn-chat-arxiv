    "translated_abstract": "数据聚类会降低有效样本量，使得工具变量模型的推断更严格，工具数量与有效样本量的比值更快地非常接近。聚类数据因此增加了对许多和弱工具鲁棒测试的需求。然而，之前开发的所有许多和弱工具鲁棒测试都不能应用于这种数据，因为它们所有都需要独立观测值。因此，本文针对聚类数据适应了两个这样的测试。第一，通过从安德森-鲁宾统计量中删除聚类而不是个体观测值，提出了一种聚类千刀万剐的安德森-鲁宾检验。第二，提出了一种聚类多工具安德森-鲁宾检验，通过使用更优但更复杂的加权矩阵来改善第一个测试。我证明了，如果聚类满足不变性假设，则这些测试的置信区间是有效的。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了两种适用于聚类数据的工具变量模型的鲁棒检验，聚类横切安德森-鲁宾试验和聚类多工具安德森-鲁宾试验。这些测试能够处理聚类依赖、多工具和弱识别情况下的问题。"
