    "translated_abstract": "作为两个操作性碳排放增长最快的新兴排放国，中国和印度的历史排放模式和脱碳努力仍需进一步探讨。本研究旨在首次提出一个考虑终端使用性能的碳强度模型，利用改进的结构分解方法评估了过去20年中国和印度住宅建筑运营脱碳进展。结果表明：(1) 2000年至2020年间中国和印度住宅建筑总体运营碳强度分别增加了1.4%和2.5%。家庭支出相关的能源强度和排放因素是住宅建筑脱碳的关键。 (2) 建筑电气化在住宅空调（中国减少了87.7千克二氧化碳排放量，印度减少了130.2千克二氧化碳排放量）和家用电器（中国减少了169.7千克二氧化碳排放量，印度减少了43.4千克二氧化碳排放量）的脱碳中发挥了重要作用。 (3) 可再生能源在电力生产中的应用是中国运营碳强度下降趋势的主要驱动因素。但两国在2030年实现运营脱碳目标仍具有挑战性。",

The study finds that household expenditure-related energy intensity and emission factors are crucial in decarbonizing residential buildings, while building electrification and renewable energy deployment are important means to achieve decarbonization targets. However, achieving operational decarbonization targets by 2030 remains challenging in both countries."
