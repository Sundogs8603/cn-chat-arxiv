    "abstract": "Easy-to-Read Language (E2R) is a controlled language variant that makes any written text more accessible through the use of clear, direct and simple language. It is mainly aimed at people with cognitive or intellectual disabilities, among other target users. Plain Language (PL), on the other hand, is a variant of a given language, which aims to promote the use of simple language to communicate information. German counts with Leichte Sprache (LS), its version of E2R, and Einfache Sprache (ES), its version of PL. In recent years, important developments have been conducted in the field of LS. This paper offers an updated overview of the existing Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and resources for LS. Besides, it also aims to set out the situation with regard to LS and ES in Germany.",

    "translated_abstract": "易读性语言（E2R）是一种受控制的语言变体，通过使用清晰、直接和简单的语言，使任何书面文本更易理解。它主要面向认知或智力残疾等目标用户群体。而普通语言（PL）则旨在通过使用简单的语言来传达信息。德语拥有其易读语言版本Leichte Sprache（LS）和Einfache Sprache（ES）版本的PL。近年来，在LS领域进行了重要发展。本文提供了LS的自然语言处理（NLP）工具和资源的最新综述。此外，还旨在阐述德国LS和ES的状况。",
