The unrestricted model of our test is a linear panel data model of social interactions with dyad-specific peer effects. The proposed AR test evaluates if the peer effect coefficients are all zero. As the number of peer effect coefficients increases with the sample size, so does the number of instrumental variables (IVs) employed to estimate the unrestricted model, rendering Bekker's many-IV environment. By extending existing many-IV asymptotic results to panel data, we show that the proposed AR test is asymptotically valid under the presence of both individual and time fixed effects. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the finite sample performance of the AR test and provide two applications to demonstrate its empirical relevance.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种Anderson-Rubin（AR）检验方法，用于在没有指定网络结构的面板数据中检验同行影响。我们的无限制模型是一个带有特定对等体同行影响的线性面板数据模型。所提出的AR检验评估同行效应系数是否全部为零。随着对等体效应系数的增加，使用的工具变量（IVs）数量随样本数量增加而增加，形成Bekker的多IV环境。通过将现有的多IV渐近结果扩展到面板数据，我们展示了所提出的AR测试在存在个体和时间固定效应的情况下是渐近有效的。我们进行了蒙特卡罗模拟来研究AR测试的有限样本性能，并提供了两个应用来证明其实证意义。",
