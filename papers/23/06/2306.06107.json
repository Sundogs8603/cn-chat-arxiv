    "abstract": "Many Machine Learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: There exist methodologies that add a small (imperceptible) perturbation to an input such that the model comes up with a wrong prediction. Better understanding of such attacks is crucial in particular for models used in security-critical domains, such as monitoring of water distribution networks, in order to devise counter-measures enhancing model robustness and trustworthiness.  We propose a taxonomy for adversarial attacks against machine learning based leakage detectors in water distribution networks. Following up on this, we focus on a particular type of attack: an adversary searching the least sensitive point, that is, the location in the water network where the largest possible undetected leak could occur. Based on a mathematical formalization of the least sensitive point problem, we use three different algorithmic approaches to find a solution. Results are evaluated on two benchmark water distribution networks.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多机器学习模型都容易受到对抗性攻击，攻击者可以对输入进行微小的扰动，在不被察觉的情况下导致模型做出错误的预测。为了制定增强模型鲁棒性和可信度的对策，特别是在安全关键领域中使用的模型，比如监测水配管网络，在对抗性攻击方面的更好理解至关重要。本文提出了一种对抗性攻击分类法，针对使用机器学习的水配管网络泄漏探测器。在此基础上，我们重点关注一种特定类型的攻击：攻击者寻找最不敏感点，也就是可能发生最大可能未被检测泄漏的水网位置。基于最不敏感点问题的数学形式化，我们使用三种不同的算法方法来寻找解决方案。结果在两个基准水配管网络上进行评估。",
