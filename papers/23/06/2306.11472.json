    "translated_abstract": "高斯过程和Kriging在传统的时空建模和预测中得到了广泛应用。然而，这些技术通常预设数据是从具有参数协方差结构的平稳高斯过程中观测得到的。现实中的过程往往表现出非高斯性和非平稳性。此外，基于似然的高斯过程推断对于大型数据集来说计算成本高昂。本文提出了一个基于深度神经网络的时空插值和预测的两阶段模型。第一步进行插值，利用具有时空基函数构建的相关神经网络的嵌入层。第二步采用长短期记忆（LSTM）和卷积LSTM来预测给定位置的未来观测。我们在DNN中采用基于分位数的损失函数来提供概率预测。与Kriging相比，提出的方法不需要假设过程是平稳和高斯性的，可以处理现实世界中的非高斯性和非平稳性时空数据集。基于深度学习和LSTM的预测模型实现了高精度的插值和概率预测。",
