    "translated_abstract": "无人机摄影测量技术可以制作地形正射影像和数字地表模型（DSM）。然而，通过这种技术制作的水体DSM会显示水面扭曲，从而无法准确测定水面高程。因此，我们提出了一种新的解决方案，使用卷积神经网络（CNN）在摄影测量DSM和正射影像中用作水面高程估算器。另外，我们还改进了之前的“水边缘”方法，通过使用前后指数加权移动平均滤除了异常值。采用链码进行水面高程值的线性回归，进一步改进了这两种方法。该解决方案可以估算预测的不确定性。这是第一次使用深度学习进行此任务。同时，作者在冬季和夏季条件下创建了一个全新的机器学习数据集，该数据集是在一条小的低地河流上收集的。",
