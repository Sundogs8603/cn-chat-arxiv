    "translated_abstract": "随着现在在线和离线可获取的数据数量过于庞大，推荐系统变得越来越必要，以帮助用户找到符合他们兴趣的物品。当社交网络信息存在时，有一些方法利用这些信息来做出更好的推荐，但这些方法通常有复杂的结构和训练过程。此外，许多现有的方法使用图神经网络，而这些网络训练起来非常困难。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了基于社交感知和时间因素的解码器推荐系统(STUDY)。STUDY采用一个经过修改的transformer解码器网络的单向前传，对社交网络图中相邻的用户组进行联合推断。我们在基于学校课堂结构定义社交网络的教育内容领域测试了我们的方法。我们的方法在保持单一均匀网络设计简单性的同时，优于社交和顺序方法。",
