    "translated_abstract": "暗网市场一直是非法交易的重要出口，服务于全球数百万用户已有十余年。然而，并不是所有用户都是相同的。本文旨在通过分析一个包括了31个市场在2011年到2021年期间的4,000万比特币交易数据集，识别与暗市场相关的比特币交易网络中的关键参与者，评估他们的角色。首先，我们提出了一个算法将用户分类为买家或卖家，表明交易量的很大一部分集中在少数精英市场参与者手中。然后，我们调查了市场星图和用户到用户网络，并突出了一个新类用户的重要性，即同时在多个市场上运营的multihomers。具体而言，我们展示了multihomers和卖家到卖家之间的交互网络可以揭示暗市场生态对外部冲击的抵抗力。我们的发现表明，了解暗网市场中关键参与者之间的交易对于识别和破坏这些平台上的非法活动至关重要。",

The interaction networks between multihomers and sellers can shed light on the resilience of the dark market ecosystem against external shocks. Understanding transactions between these key players is crucial for identifying and disrupting illicit activities on these platforms."
