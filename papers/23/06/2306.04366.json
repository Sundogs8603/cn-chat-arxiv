    "translated_abstract": "协同移动群感知可以通过促进任务感知的团队合作来提高数据质量和覆盖范围，而工人招募则代表着一个复杂的多目标优化问题。现有策略主要关注工人本身的特征，忽略了工人之间的非对称信任关系，从而影响了任务效用评估的合理性。为解决这个问题，本文首先使用Mini-Batch K-Means聚类算法和边缘服务器来实现高效的分布式工人招募。利用历史数据和任务要求获得工人的能力类型和距离。使用工人社交网络中的信任导向图输入至图卷积网络（GCN）框架进行训练，捕获工人之间的非对称信任关系。通过工人之间的高信任值，防止CMCS场景下的隐私泄露。最终，利用预测的信任和工人能力构建了一个无向招募图，以实现有效的任务分配。实验结果表明，与现有方法相比，这种招募方法在招募准确度、任务完成时间和能量消耗方面表现优异。",
