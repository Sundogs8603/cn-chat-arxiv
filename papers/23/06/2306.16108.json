In Task 11b Phase B, which is focused on answer generation, both models demonstrated competitive abilities with leading systems. Remarkably, they achieved this with simple zero-shot learning, grounded with relevant snippets. Even without relevant snippets, their performance was decent, though not on par with the best systems. Interestingly, the older and cheaper GPT-3.5-Turbo system was able to compete with GPT-4 in the grounded Q&A setting on factoid and list answers. In Task 11b Phase A, focusing on retrieval, query expansion through zero-shot learning improved performance, but the models fell short compared to other systems. The code needed to rerun these experiments is available through GitHub.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们评估了商业大型语言模型 GPT-3.5-Turbo 和 GPT-4 在 2023 年 BioASQ 挑战中的任务表现。在任务 11b 第二阶段中，也就是答案生成任务中，这两个模型通过简单的零样本学习和相关片段的支撑表现出了与领先系统相竞争的能力。值得注意的是，即使没有相关片段，它们的性能也令人满意，尽管没有达到最佳系统的水平。有趣的是，较旧且更便宜的 GPT-3.5-Turbo 系统在基于事实和列表答案的问答环境中能够与 GPT-4 相竞争。在任务 11b 第一阶段中，侧重于检索，通过零样本学习的查询扩展提高了模型的性能，但与其他系统相比仍然有所不足。重新运行这些实验所需的代码可在 GitHub 上获得。",
