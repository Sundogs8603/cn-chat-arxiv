    "translated_abstract": "由于缺乏大规模注释的三维数据集，三维物体实例分割是一项具有挑战性的任务。本文展示了可以通过利用二维预训练模型来有效解决该任务。我们提出了一种新颖的方法，通过神经场表示将2D分段向上提升到3D，并将它们通过慢-快对比融合。这种方法鼓励跨帧的多视角一致性。我们方法的核心是一个可扩展的、适用于具有大量物体的场景的慢-快聚类目标函数。与先前的方法不同的是，我们的方法不需要对物体数量或跨帧物体跟踪进行设置上界。为了展示慢-快聚类的可扩展性，我们创建了一个名为Messy Rooms的新的半真实数据集，其中场景中最多有500个物体。我们的方法在ScanNet、Hypersim和Replica数据集的具有挑战性的场景中表现优于现有技术。",
