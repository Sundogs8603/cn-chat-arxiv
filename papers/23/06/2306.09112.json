    "translated_abstract": "在结构预测中，目标对象具有丰富的内部结构，这种结构无法分解为独立的组件，并违反了常见的独立同分布假设。这一挑战在应用程序中表现为指数级的输出空间，如图像分割或场景图生成。我们提出了一种新的结构化预测PAC-Bayesian风险界限，其中泛化速率不仅随着结构化示例的数量而且还随着它们的大小而变化。基本假设符合生成模型上的最新研究，即数据由分解参考度量的Knothe-Rosenblatt重新排列生成。这使得我们可以将随机输出变量之间的结构显式地提取到Wasserstein依赖矩阵中。我们的工作为利用强大的生成模型在结构预测这种具有挑战性的情况下建立判别式下游任务的泛化界限迈出了初步的一步。",
