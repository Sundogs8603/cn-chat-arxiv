    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，人工智能研究人员在法律智能方面取得了重大进展。然而，现有研究并未关注判例颠倒中所蕴含的重要价值，这限制了法律智能效率的提高。本文提出了一个可用于推断判例颠倒的因果框架（FAIR），该框架基于真实的中国判例对判例颠倒问题进行建模。我们使用因果推断方法挖掘判例颠倒的原因，并将得到的因果关系注入神经网络作为先验知识。然后，我们的框架在一个具有挑战性的数据集上作为法律判例预测任务进行验证。实验结果表明，我们的框架能够挖掘出判例颠倒中最关键的因素，得到的因果关系能够有效提高神经网络的性能。此外，我们还讨论了大型语言模型在法律领域的泛化能力。",
