    "translated_abstract": "近期关于图神经网络（GNN）的研究提供了实证和理论证据，支持它们在捕捉同构和某些异构图上的结构模式方面的有效性。值得注意的是，大多数实际中的同构和异构图都由同构和异构结构模式的混合节点组成，表现出一定的结构差异性。然而，关于不同结构模式下的节点（例如在异构图中的同构节点）在GNN分类任务中的表现分析仍然很有限。本文通过理论和实证研究证明，GNN在同构图中的同构节点和异构图中的异构节点上的表现通常是出色的，而在另一组节点上表现不佳，表现出性能差异性。我们进一步识别了测试展示不同结构模式节点时GNN的效应，并提出了一种通过使用GNN的加权聚合以适应性结构差异性的新框架的解决方案。在各种数据集上的实验表明，所提出的方法在解决结构差异性和提高节点分类任务的性能方面是有效的。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study reveals that GNNs perform well on homophilic nodes in homophilic graphs and heterophilic nodes in heterophilic graph, but not on opposite node sets, showing a performance disparity. It proposes a new framework that uses weighted aggregation to adapt to structural disparity and improve performance on different structural pattern nodes."
