    "translated_abstract": "为了提高在旋转机械强噪声下识别故障的性能，本文提出了一种动态特征重构信号图法，它在所提出的端到端故障诊断模型中起着关键作用。具体来说，首先利用小波包分解（WPD）将原始机械信号分解为包括系数矩阵在内的多个子带。然后，利用最初定义的两个要素MDD和DDD，提出了一种基于L2能量范数的动态特征选择方法（DFSL），它可以根据能量范数分布的差异动态地选择WPD的特征系数矩阵，使每个子信号能够进行适应性信号重构。接下来，将最优特征子带的系数矩阵进行重构和重新组合，得到特征信号图。最后，利用2D-卷积神经网络（2D-CNN）从特征信号图中提取深层特征。",
