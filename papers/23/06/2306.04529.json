    "translated_abstract": "目前，大多数机器学习模型都由中央团队培训，很少进行更新。相比之下，开放源代码软件开发通过分布式协作使用版本控制系统进行共享工件的迭代开发。为了支持机器学习模型的协作和不断改进，本文介绍 Git-Theta，一种针对机器学习模型的版本控制系统扩展。Git-Theta是Git的扩展，可精细跟踪模型参数的更改以及代码和其他工件。与现有的版本控制系统不同，Git-Theta利用检查点的结构支持高效的通信更新、自动模型合并以及有关两个模型版本之间差异的有意义报告。此外，Git-Theta还包括一插件系统，使用户能够轻松添加对不同机器学习框架的支持。",
