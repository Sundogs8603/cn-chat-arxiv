    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一系列基于随机投影（RP）的差分隐私（DP）算法，适用于机器学习、数据挖掘和信息检索等各种应用。其中，基于符号随机投影（SignRP）的iDP-SignRP算法在个体差分隐私（iDP）设置下非常有效，而DP-SignOPORP算法在标准DP设置下利用“一次排列+一次随机投影”（OPORP）极大地改进了文献中现有的算法。除不考虑符号之外，在DP-RP家族中，DP-OPORP算法表现最佳。iDP（个体差分隐私）的概念仅适用于特定的数据集。虽然iDP不是严格的DP，但在某些应用中（如向小组用户发布包括嵌入信息或个性化推荐等内容的数据集，而不泄露不属于该组的个人的任何私人信息）可能很有用。",
