    "abstract": "In this paper we describe the University of Sheffield's submission to the AmericasNLP 2023 Shared Task on Machine Translation into Indigenous Languages which comprises the translation from Spanish to eleven indigenous languages. Our approach consists of extending, training, and ensembling different variations of NLLB-200. We use data provided by the organizers and data from various other sources such as constitutions, handbooks, news articles, and backtranslations generated from monolingual data. On the dev set, our best submission outperforms the baseline by 11% average chrF across all languages, with substantial improvements particularly for Aymara, Guarani and Quechua. On the test set, we achieve the highest average chrF of all the submissions, we rank first in four of the eleven languages, and at least one of our submissions ranks in the top 3 for all languages.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文描述了谢菲尔德大学提交给AmericasNLP 2023机器翻译土著语言分享任务的方法，该任务包括将西班牙语翻译成十一种土著语言。 我们的方法包括扩展，训练和与不同种类的NLLB-200组合。 我们使用组织者提供的数据以及宪法，手册，新闻文章和从单语数据生成的回译等各种其他来源的数据。 在开发集上，我们的最佳成绩在所有语言的平均chrF上比基线提高了11％，尤其是在Aymara，Guarani和Quechua方面有显着的改进。 在测试集上，我们实现了所有提交中最高的平均chrF，我们在11种语言中排名前四位，并且我们的至少一个提交在所有语言中排名前三位。",
