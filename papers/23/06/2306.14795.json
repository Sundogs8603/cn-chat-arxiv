    "translated_abstract": "尽管预训练的大型语言模型的进展不断展现，但构建一个用于语言和其他多模态数据（如动作）的统一模型仍然具有挑战性且尚未触及。幸运的是，人体运动显示出一种语义耦合，类似于人类语言，常被视为一种肢体语言形式。通过将语言数据与大规模动作模型融合，可以实现增强与动作相关任务性能的动作语言预训练。基于这一洞察力，我们提出了MotionGPT，一种统一、多功能且易于使用的动作语言模型，用于处理多个与动作相关的任务。具体而言，我们使用离散向量量化来处理人体运动，并将三维动作转换为动作令牌，类似于词令牌的生成过程。基于这个\"动作词汇\"，我们以统一的方式对动作和文本进行语言建模，将人体运动视为一种特定的语言。此外，受提示的启发。",
