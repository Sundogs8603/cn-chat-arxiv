    "abstract": "In recent years, many recommender systems have utilized textual data for topic extraction to enhance interpretability. However, our findings reveal a noticeable deficiency in the coherence of keywords within topics, resulting in low explainability of the model. This paper introduces a novel approach called entropy regularization to address the issue, leading to more interpretable topics extracted from recommender systems, while ensuring that the performance of the primary task stays competitively strong. The effectiveness of the strategy is validated through experiments on a variation of the probabilistic matrix factorization model that utilizes textual data to extract item embeddings. The experiment results show a significant improvement in topic coherence, which is quantified by cosine similarity on word embeddings.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，许多推荐系统利用文本数据进行主题提取以提高可解释性。然而，我们的研究发现主题内关键词的连贯性显著不足，导致模型的可解释性较低。本文引入了一种新的方法，称为熵规则，以解决这个问题，从而从推荐系统中提取更加可解释的主题，同时确保主任务的性能保持竞争力。该策略的有效性通过在利用文本数据提取项目嵌入的概率矩阵分解模型的变体上进行实验证实。实验结果表明，在使用词嵌入的余弦相似度量化的主题连贯性方面有显著提高。",
