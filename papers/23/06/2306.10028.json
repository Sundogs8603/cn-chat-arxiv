    "translated_abstract": "点击率预测旨在预测用户点击项的概率，是在线推荐和广告系统中的关键任务之一。在这样的系统中，丰富的用户行为（即长期和短期）已被证明对捕捉用户兴趣非常有价值。工业界和学术界都对这个主题非常关注，并提出了不同的方法来建模长期和短期用户行为数据。但仍存在一些未解决的问题。更具体地说，（1）基于规则和截断的方法从长期行为中提取信息易导致信息丢失，（2）从短期行为中提取信息时单一反馈行为无论场景都会导致信息混淆和噪声。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了一种基于图的长期和短期兴趣模型，称为GLSM。它由一个多兴趣图结构组成，用于捕捉长期用户行为，一个多场景兴趣子图用于捕捉短期用户行为。",
