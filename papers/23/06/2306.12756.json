    "translated_abstract": "最近，生成式检索在信息检索领域日益受到关注，它通过直接生成标识符来检索文档。迄今为止，人们已经付出了很多努力来开发有效的生成式检索模型。然而，在鲁棒性方面却得到的关注较少。当一个新的检索范式进入到真实世界应用中时，衡量超出分布（OOD）泛化也是至关重要的，即生成式检索模型如何泛化到新的分布中。为了回答这个问题，我们首先从检索问题的三个方面定义OOD鲁棒性：1）查询变化；2）未知的查询类型；3）未知任务。基于这个分类法，我们进行实证研究，分析了几个代表性生成式检索模型与密集检索模型在OOD鲁棒性方面的比较。实证结果表明，生成式检索模型的OOD鲁棒性比密集检索模型弱，特别是在面向任务的OOD场景中更明显。我们进一步研究了造成生成式检索模型鲁棒性较弱的原因，并提出了改善它们OOD泛化性能的潜在解决方法。",

The empirical results show that generative retrieval models have weaker OOD robustness, particularly in task-oriented OOD scenarios. Potential solutions are proposed to improve their OOD generalization performance."
