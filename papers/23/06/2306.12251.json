    "abstract": "With a long history of traditional Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) algorithms and recently popular Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), it is still not clear (1) how they perform under a standard comprehensive setting, (2) whether GNNs outperform traditional algorithms such as tree ensembles, and (3) their efficiency on large-scale graphs. In response, we present GADBench -- a comprehensive benchmark for supervised anomalous node detection on static graphs. GADBench provides a thorough comparison across 23 distinct models on ten real-world GAD datasets ranging from thousands to millions of nodes ($\\sim$6M). Our main finding is that tree ensembles with simple neighborhood aggregation outperform all other baselines, including the latest GNNs tailored for the GAD task. By making GADBench available as an open-source tool, we offer pivotal insights into the current advancements of GAD and establish a solid foundation for future research.

    "translated_abstract": "长期以来，传统图形异常检测（GAD）算法和最近流行的图形神经网络（GNN）一直存在。目前尚不清楚它们在标准综合设置下的性能如何，GNN是否优于传统算法（如树集成）以及它们在大规模图表上的效率如何。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了GADBench - 一个静态图形监督异常节点检测的全面基准。GADBench在从数千到数百万节点（约6M）的十个真实GAD数据集上提供了23种不同模型的彻底比较。我们的主要发现是，具有简单邻域汇聚的树集成胜过所有其他基线，包括最新的针对GAD任务量身定制的GNN。通过将GADBench作为开源工具提供，我们提供了有关GAD当前进展的关键见解，并为未来研究奠定了坚实的基础。",
