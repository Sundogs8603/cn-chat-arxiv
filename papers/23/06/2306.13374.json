    "abstract": "The research on human activity recognition has provided novel solutions to many applications like healthcare, sports, and user profiling. Considering the complex nature of human activities, it is still challenging even after effective and efficient sensors are available. The existing works on human activity recognition using smartphone sensors focus on recognizing basic human activities like sitting, sleeping, standing, stair up and down and running. However, more than these basic activities is needed to analyze human behavioural pattern. The proposed framework recognizes basic human activities using deep learning models. Also, ambient sensors like PIR, pressure sensors, and smartphone-based sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes are combined to make it hybrid-sensor-based human activity recognition. The hybrid approach helped derive more activities than the basic ones, which also helped derive human activity patterns or user profiling. User profiling provides sufficient informatio",

    "translated_abstract": "人类活动识别的研究为医疗保健、运动和用户画像等许多应用提供了新颖的解决方案。考虑到人类活动的复杂性，即使有有效的传感器仍然具有挑战性。目前使用智能手机传感器进行人类活动识别的现有工作，专注于识别如坐、睡眠、站立、上下楼梯和奔跑等基本的人类活动。然而，分析人类行为模式需要更多的活动。所提出的框架使用深度学习模型识别基本人类活动，同时结合环境传感器（如PIR、压力传感器）和基于智能手机的传感器（如加速度计和陀螺仪）来实现混合传感器人类活动识别。混合方法帮助推导出比基本活动更多的活动，这也有助于推导出人类活动模式或用户画像。用户画像提供了足够的信息。",
