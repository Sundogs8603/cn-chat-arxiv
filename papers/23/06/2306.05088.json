    "abstract": "Phonetic convergence describes the automatic and unconscious speech adaptation of two interlocutors in a conversation. This paper proposes a Siamese recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to measure the convergence of the holistic spectral characteristics of speech sounds in an L2-L2 interaction. We extend an alternating reading task (the ART) dataset by adding 20 native Slovak L2 English speakers. We train and test the Siamese RNN model to measure phonetic convergence of L2 English speech from three different native language groups: Italian (9 dyads), French (10 dyads) and Slovak (10 dyads). Our results indicate that the Siamese RNN model effectively captures the dynamics of phonetic convergence and the speaker's imitation ability. Moreover, this text-independent model is scalable and capable of handling L1-induced speaker variability.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种孪生递归神经网络（RNN）结构，用于测量L2-L2交互中语音音质的收敛。我们通过添加20名母语为斯洛伐克语的英语学习者来扩展交替阅读任务（ART）数据集。我们训练和测试了该模型，从三个不同的母语组，即意大利语（9对），法语（10对）和斯洛伐克语（10对）中测量L2英语语音的语音收敛。结果表明，孪生RNN模型可以有效捕捉语音收敛和说话者的模仿能力的动态。此外，这是一个文本无关的模型，可以扩展，并能够处理由L1引起的说话者差异。",
