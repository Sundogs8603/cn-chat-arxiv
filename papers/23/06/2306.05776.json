    "translated_abstract": "受人工神经网络在广泛AI任务中的卓越成功启发，变分量子电路(VQCs)最近在量子机器学习应用方面出现了一波高潮。VQC所展示出的有希望的结果，如改进的泛化和减少的参数训练要求，归功于量子计算的强大算法能力。然而，目前的基于梯度的VQC训练方法没有充分考虑到可训练参数(或权重)通常被用作旋转门中的角度这一事实。为了解决这个问题，我们扩展了Kolle等人引入的VQC权重重新映射概念。这种方法明确地将权重映射到长度为$2\\pi$的区间，镜像常规机器学习中已被证明在众多场景中非常有益的数据重新缩放技术。在我们的研究中，我们使用了七种不同的权重重新映射函数来评估它们的实现效果。",
