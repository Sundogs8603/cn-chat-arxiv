    "translated_abstract": "现有的旋律和声编配模型在提高生成的和声质量方面取得了很大进展，但大多数忽略了音乐中的情感。同时，以前的方法所生成的和声变化性不足。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的基于LSTM的分层变分自编码器(LHVAE)，研究情感条件对旋律和声编配的影响，同时提高了生成的和声质量并捕捉了丰富的和弦进行变化。具体来说，LHVAE在不同层次（乐章和小节级别）上融合了潜在变量和情感条件，以建模全局和局部音乐属性。另外，我们在每个步骤中引入了基于注意力的旋律上下文向量，以更好地学习旋律和和声之间的对应关系。客观评估的实验结果表明，我们提出的模型胜过了其他基于LSTM的模型。通过主观评估，我们证明了我们的模型可以生成符合给定情感的和声进行，并在感知情感表达方面优于现有方法。",
