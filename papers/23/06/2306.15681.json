    "translated_abstract": "由于自然语言处理的显著进展，医疗保健领域中的问答问题（QA）引起了广泛关注。然而，现有的医疗保健QA数据集主要集中在医学影像、临床记录或结构化的电子健康记录表上。这使得将心电图（ECG）数据与这些系统相结合的巨大潜力几乎未被利用。为填补这一空白，我们提出了ECG-QA，这是专门针对ECG分析设计的第一个QA数据集。该数据集包括共70个涵盖了广泛临床相关ECG主题的问题模板，每个问题都经过一名ECG专家的验证，以确保其临床效用。因此，我们的数据集包含了多样化的ECG解读问题，包括需要对两个不同的ECG进行比较分析的问题。此外，我们还进行了许多实验，为未来的研究方向提供了有价值的见解。我们相信ECG-QA将成为一个宝贵的资源，供研究者们探索和应用。",
