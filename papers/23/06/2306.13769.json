    "translated_abstract": "近年来，提出了AI辅助的药物设计方法，以生成给定目标蛋白质的口袋结构的分子。大部分方法都是基于原子级别的方法，将原子视为基本组件，并生成原子位置和类型。然而，这种方法很难生成具有复杂结构的现实片段。为解决这个问题，我们提出了D3FG，一种基于功能团的扩散模型，用于口袋特异性分子生成和扩展。D3FG将分子分解为两类组件：定义为刚性体的功能团和质点的连接器。两种类型的组件可以共同形成增强配体-蛋白质相互作用的复杂片段。具体而言，在扩散过程中，D3FG将组件的位置、方向和类型的数据分布扩散到一个先验分布；在生成过程中，神经网络参数化去噪器逐渐去除三个变量的噪声，以获得现实分子。我们在三个任务上评估了我们的方法：针对八个目标进行库生成，针对五种现有药物进行片段完善，以及针对两个未知参考分子的目标进行去新设计，显示出我们的方法可以生成多样化和高品质的分子，并具有出色的性能。",
