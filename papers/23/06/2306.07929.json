    "translated_abstract": "受认知科学对人类记忆和推理机制的启发，提出了一种新的可演化LLM（大型语言模型）智能体框架REMEMBERER。通过为LLM装备长期经验记忆，REMEMBERER能够利用过去剧集的经验，甚至可以为不同的任务目标提供优异的LLM智能体，这优于具有固定实例或具有短暂工作记忆的LLM智能体。我们进一步介绍了经验记忆的强化学习（RLEM）来更新记忆。因此，整个系统可以从成功和失败的经验中学习，并在不微调LLM参数的情况下发展其能力。以此方式，所提出的REMEMBERER构成了半参数RL代理。在两个RL任务集上进行了大量实验以评估所提出的框架。不同初始化和训练集的平均结果对于成功率超过先前SOTA 4％和2％。",
