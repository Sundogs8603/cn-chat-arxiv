    "translated_abstract": "在真实世界中的学习排序应用中，分级标签广泛存在，特别是在人工标注的相关性数据中。传统的学习排序技术旨在优化文件的排序顺序。然而，它们通常忽略了实际分数的预测。这使它们无法在需要考虑分数的应用程序中被采用，例如筛选“劣质”文件。在良好的排序性能和良好的等级预测性能之间取得平衡仍然是一个未经探索的问题。现有的研究要么只关注排序性能而不校准模型输出，要么将成绩视为数值，假设标签在线性范围内，并未利用序数级别信息。本文对学习排序与成绩进行了深入研究，同时重视排序性能和等级预测性能。我们提供了关于如何使用非标量分级进行排名的形式化讨论，并提出了一个多目标函数，用于联合优化排序和成绩预测性能。基于两个真实数据集的实验表明，我们的方法在排序和等级预测性能方面均显著优于现有方法。",
