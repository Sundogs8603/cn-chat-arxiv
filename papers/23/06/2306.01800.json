    "translated_abstract": "人工智能研究的技术进步建立在计算机科学、统计学和数学等领域的突破之上。然而，在过去的十年中，人工智能研究人员越来越多地借鉴社会科学，转向人类互动来解决模型开发的挑战。向众包工人支付费用以生成或筛选数据，也就是数据增强，在许多人工智能研究领域已经成为必不可少的手段，例如自然语言处理和从人类反馈中进行强化学习。其他经常与众包工人互动的领域，如心理学，已经制定了常见的治理要求和规范，以确保研究在伦理上得到了实施。本研究探讨了AI研究和数据增强的相关研究伦理要求和规范的开展程度和程度。我们关注两个领先的会议ICLR和NeurIPS以及期刊出版社Springer所采取的方法。通过对这三个来源的1,468篇论文的纵向分析，我们确定了研究伦理规范存在的差距，并提出了改进和增强AI研究和数据增强的伦理实践的建议。",
