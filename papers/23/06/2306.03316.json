    "translated_abstract": "实体标准化将来自自由文本中的噪声提及映射到知识库中的标准实体。相对于其他实体相关任务，这项任务的唯一挑战是缺乏周围环境和提及形式的数种变化，特别是在跨领域泛化时标记数据不足。以前的研究大多集中于开发要么严重依赖上下文的模型，要么专门针对某个特定领域。相比之下，我们提出了 CoSiNES，这是一个具有对比双子网络的通用和适应性框架，可以有效地将预训练语言模型适应到新领域的实体的语法和语义特征中。我们在技术领域构建了一个新数据集，其中包含640个技术栈实体和6412个来自工业内容管理系统的提及。我们证明了 CoSiNES 比基线算法具有更高的精度和更快的运行时间。",
