    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a crucial regulator of gene transcription and has been linked to various diseases, including autoimmune diseases and cancers. However, diagnostics based on DNA methylation face challenges due to large feature sets and small sample sizes, resulting in overfitting and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose MIRACLE, a novel interpretable neural network that leverages autoencoder-based multi-task learning to integrate multiple datasets and jointly identify common patterns in DNA methylation.  MIRACLE's architecture reflects the relationships between methylation sites, genes, and pathways, ensuring biological interpretability and meaningfulness. The network comprises an encoder and a decoder, with a bottleneck layer representing pathway information as the basic unit of heredity. Customized defined MaskedLinear Layer is constrained by site-gene-pathway graph adjacency matrix information, which provides explainability and expresses the site-gene-pathway",
