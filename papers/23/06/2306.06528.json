    "abstract": "We introduce a library called Push that takes a probabilistic programming approach to Bayesian deep learning (BDL). This library enables concurrent execution of BDL inference algorithms on multi-GPU hardware for neural network (NN) models. To accomplish this, Push introduces an abstraction that represents an input NN as a particle. Push enables easy creation of particles so that an input NN can be replicated and particles can communicate asynchronously so that a variety of parameter updates can be expressed, including common BDL algorithms. Our hope is that Push lowers the barrier to experimenting with BDL by streamlining the scaling of particles across GPUs. We evaluate the scaling behavior of particles on single-node multi-GPU devices on vision and scientific machine learning (SciML) tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一个名为Push的库，采用概率编程的方法来进行贝叶斯深度学习（BDL）。该库可在多GPU硬件上并发执行BDL推理算法，用于神经网络（NN）模型。为实现这一目标，Push引入了一种抽象，将输入NN表示为一个粒子。Push使得创建粒子变得容易，以便于复制和粒子之间的异步通信，以实现各种参数更新，包括常见的BDL算法。我们希望通过Push降低进行BDL实验的门槛，通过简化在多GPU上扩展粒子的操作。我们评估了利用单节点多GPU设备进行视觉和科学机器学习（SciML）任务时的粒子扩展行为。",
