    "abstract": "This work presents a novel and promising approach to the clinical management of acute stroke. Using machine learning techniques, our research has succeeded in developing accurate diagnosis and prediction real-time models from hemodynamic data. These models are able to diagnose stroke subtype with 30 minutes of monitoring, to predict the exitus during the first 3 hours of monitoring, and to predict the stroke recurrence in just 15 minutes of monitoring. Patients with difficult access to a \\acrshort{CT} scan, and all patients that arrive at the stroke unit of a specialized hospital will benefit from these positive results. The results obtained from the real-time developed models are the following: stroke diagnosis around $98\\%$ precision ($97.8\\%$ Sensitivity, $99.5\\%$ Specificity), exitus prediction with $99.8\\%$ precision ($99.8\\%$ Sens., $99.9\\%$ Spec.) and $98\\%$ precision predicting stroke recurrence ($98\\%$ Sens., $99\\%$ Spec.).",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖和有前景的急性中风临床管理方法。利用机器学习技术，我们的研究成功开发了从血流动力学数据中实时诊断和预测模型。这些模型能够在30分钟内诊断中风亚型，在监测的前3小时内预测死亡率，并且在仅15分钟的监测内预测中风复发。那些难以获取CT扫描的患者，以及抵达专科医院中风单元的所有患者都将从这些积极的结果中受益。实时开发的模型得到的结果如下：中风诊断准确率约为$98\\%$（$97.8\\%$敏感性，$99.5\\%$特异性），预测死亡率的精度为$99.8\\%$（$99.8\\%$敏感性，$99.9\\%$特异性），预测中风复发的精确度为$98\\%$（$98\\%$敏感性，$99\\%$特异性）。",
