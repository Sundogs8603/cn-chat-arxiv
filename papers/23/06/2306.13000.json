    "translated_abstract": "随着生成语言模型在越来越广泛的应用中被部署，有关它们政治价值的担忧已成为前沿问题，各个政治派别对其存在偏见和缺乏中立性的批评纷至沓来。本文通过审计用于众包伦理的大型语言模型Delphi [arXiv:2110.07574]，从政治争议问题的角度，分析了Delphi与各个美国政治分组的不同回应。结果发现，Delphi的置信度校准不良，呈现显著的政治倾斜。基于这些结果，作者从数据女权主义的角度探讨了中立性的问题，讨论了中立性概念如何转移权力、进一步边缘化无声的声音。这些发现有望为关于模型与价值的规范性问题形成更多有思考性的辩论做出贡献。",
