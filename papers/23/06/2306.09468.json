    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Fair Fairness Benchmark (\\textsf{FFB}), a benchmarking framework for in-processing group fairness methods. Ensuring fairness in machine learning is critical for ethical and legal compliance. However, there exist challenges in comparing and developing of fairness methods due to inconsistencies in experimental settings, lack of accessible algorithmic implementations, and limited extensibility of current fairness packages and tools. To address these issues, we introduce an open-source, standardized benchmark for evaluating in-processing group fairness methods and provide a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art methods to ensure different notions of group fairness. This work offers the following key contributions: the provision of flexible, extensible, minimalistic, and research-oriented open-source code; the establishment of unified fairness method benchmarking pipelines; and extensive benchmarking, which yields key insights from $\\mathbf{45,079}$ experiment",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了公平公正基准（FFB），这是一种针对处理中组公平方法的基准框架。确保机器学习的公平性对于符合道德和法律要求至关重要。然而，由于实验设置的不一致，缺乏易于访问的算法实现以及当前公平度量工具的有限可扩展性，存在比较和开发公平度量方法的挑战。为了解决这些问题，我们介绍了一个开源、标准化的基准，用于评估处理中的组公平方法，并提供了对确保不同民族/种族群体公平的最先进方法的全面分析。该工作提供了以下关键贡献：提供灵活、可扩展、极简和面向研究的开源代码；建立统一的公平方法基准测试流水线；进行广泛的基准测试，从 $\\mathbf{45,079}$ 个实验中获取关键见解。",
