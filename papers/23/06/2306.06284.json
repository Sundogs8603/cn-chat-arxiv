    "abstract": "This project presents a deep learning approach to generate monophonic melodies based on input beats, allowing even amateurs to create their own music compositions. Three effective methods - LSTM with Full Attention, LSTM with Local Attention, and Transformer with Relative Position Representation - are proposed for this novel task, providing great variation, harmony, and structure in the generated music. This project allows anyone to compose their own music by tapping their keyboards or ``recoloring'' beat sequences from existing works.",

    "translated_abstract": "本项目提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，通过输入节拍生成单声部的旋律，使得即使是业余爱好者也能够创作自己的音乐作品。该项目提出了三种有效的方法——带有全局注意力的LSTM、带有局部注意力的LSTM和带有相对位置表示的Transformer，为生成的音乐提供了丰富的变化、和谐和结构。该项目允许任何人通过敲击键盘或“重新调整”现有作品的节拍序列来创作自己的音乐。",
