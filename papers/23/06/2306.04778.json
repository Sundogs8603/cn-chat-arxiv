We attempt to offer a principled answer to the question of which loss functions make sense for this task, formalizing desiderata that we argue loss functions should satisfy. We construct a family of loss functions, which we dub \"diagonal bounded Bregman divergences\", that satisfy all of these axioms and includes the squared L2 error. In fact, the squared L2 error is the only acceptable loss that is relatively commonly used in practice; we thus recommend its continued use to behavioral game theorists.",

    "translated_abstract": "行为博弈论家们使用实验数据评估人类行为的预测模型，但是他们在损失函数的选择上存在很大的差异，错误率、负对数似然、交叉熵、Brier得分和L2误差都是常见的选择。本文试图提供一个原则性的答案，解决哪些损失函数适用于这个任务的问题，并规范化了认为损失函数应该满足的准则。我们构建了一组损失函数，称为“对角线有界Bregman散度”，满足所有这些公理，并包括平方L2误差。实际上，平方L2误差是相对常用的唯一可接受的损失函数。因此，我们建议行为博弈论家继续使用它。",
