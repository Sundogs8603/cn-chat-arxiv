    "translated_abstract": "在各种排名任务中，研究人员使用倒数排名来衡量对仅对一个相关项感兴趣的用户的效果。尽管广泛使用，但有证据表明，倒数排名在区分系统方面是脆弱的。这种脆弱性在现代评估环境中得到了强化，其中当前的高精度系统可能难以区分。我们通过引入并将其与最佳情况检索的概念相联系来解决倒数排名的灵敏性缺乏问题，后者是一种评估方法，专注于对可能的召回要求下最满意的用户的排名质量进行评估。这个观点使我们能够推广倒数排名并定义一种新的基于偏好的评估，我们称之为词典精度或lexiprecision。通过数学构造，我们确保lexiprecision保留了倒数排名检测到的区别，同时在广泛的基准排名上提高了灵敏度和鲁棒性。",
