    "translated_abstract": "大语言模型（LLMs）的一个令人印象深刻的新兴功能是生成代码，包括用于数据库的结构化查询语言（SQL）。对于将自然语言文本转换为SQL查询的任务，即Text-to-SQL，LLMs的适应性至关重要，具体取决于使用的适应性数据量。本文提出了一种基于LLM的Text-to-SQL模型SQL-PaLM，利用了PaLM-2，推动了两种设置的最新进展。Few-shot SQL-PaLM基于面向Text-to-SQL的基于执行的自一致提示方法，可在Spider上实现77.3%的测试套件准确度，据我们所知，这是第一个通过显着较大的微调超越以前的最新技术的方法。此外，我们证明经过精细调整的SQL-PALM可进一步提高1%的性能。为了将SQL-PaLM应用于实际场景，我们进一步评估了其对其他挑战的稳健性。",
