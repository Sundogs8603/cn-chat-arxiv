    "translated_abstract": "数据增强现在是图像训练过程中必不可少的一部分，它有效地防止了过拟合，并使模型对噪声数据集更加鲁棒。最近的混合增强策略发展出了能够丰富显著性信息的混合掩模，这是一种监督信号。然而，这些方法需要很大的计算负担来优化混合掩模。出于这个动机，我们提出了一种新颖的显著性感知混合方法GuidedMixup，它旨在在混合图像中保留显著区域，并具有较低的计算开销。我们开发了一种高效的配对算法，旨在最小化配对图像中显著区域的冲突，并在混合图像中实现丰富的显著性。此外，GuidedMixup通过平滑地插值两个配对图像来控制每个像素的混合比例，以更好地保留显著区域。在多个数据集上的实验证明，GuidedMixup在增强效果和计算效率之间提供了一个良好的平衡。",
