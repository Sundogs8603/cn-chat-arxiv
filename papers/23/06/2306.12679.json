    "abstract": "Introduction: Microblogging websites have massed rich data sources for sentiment analysis and opinion mining. In this regard, sentiment classification has frequently proven inefficient because microblog posts typically lack syntactically consistent terms and representatives since users on these social networks do not like to write lengthy statements. Also, there are some limitations to low-resource languages. The Persian language has exceptional characteristics and demands unique annotated data and models for the sentiment analysis task, which are distinctive from text features within the English dialect. Method: This paper first constructs a user opinion dataset called ITRC-Opinion by collaborative environment and insource way. Our dataset contains 60,000 informal and colloquial Persian texts from social microblogs such as Twitter and Instagram. Second, this study proposes a new deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for more effective sentiment analysis of colloquial text in s",

    "translated_abstract": "引言：微博网站已成为情感分析和观点挖掘的丰富数据源。但由于微博常缺少句法一致的术语和代表性，因此情感分类通常效率低下。波斯语言有其独特的特性，需要独特的注释数据和模型来完成情感分析任务。方法：本文首先通过协作环境和内部来源方式构建了一个名为ITRC-Opinion的用户意见数据集。其次，提出了一种新的深度卷积神经网络(CNN)模型，用于更有效地分析社交微博中的口语文本情感。",
