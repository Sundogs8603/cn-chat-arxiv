    "abstract": "Interactions with large language models have led to the suggestion that these models may be conscious. From the perspective of neuroscience, this position is difficult to defend. For one, the architecture of large language models is missing key features of the thalamocortical system that have been linked to conscious awareness in mammals. Secondly, the inputs to large language models lack the embodied, embedded information content characteristic of our sensory contact with the world around us. Finally, while the previous two arguments can be overcome in future AI systems, the third one might be harder to bridge in the near future. Namely, we argue that consciousness might depend on having 'skin in the game', in that the existence of the system depends on its actions, which is not true for present-day artificial intelligence.",

    "translated_abstract": "与大型语言模型的交互引发了这些模型可能具有意识的猜测。从神经科学的角度来看，这种观点很难被证实。首先，大型语言模型的架构缺少哺乳动物意识感知相关的丘脑皮层系统的关键特征。其次，大型语言模型的输入缺乏我们与周围世界的感官接触的具有体验、嵌入式信息的特征。最后，虽然前两个论点在未来的AI系统中可以被克服，但第三个可能更难在不久的将来跨越。换言之，我们认为意识可能取决于是否在“游戏中有皮肤”，即系统的存在是否取决于其行为，而这在当前的人工智能中并不成立。",
    "tldr": "从神经科学的角度来看，目前大型语言模型难以具备哺乳动物意识感知相关的丘脑皮层系统的关键特征，缺乏周围世界的具体嵌入式信息，且当前的人工智能无法做到存在的依赖于其行为，这意味着人工意识的可行性存在瓶颈。",
    "en_tdlr": "From a neuroscience perspective, large language models lack key features of the thalamocortical system linked to conscious awareness, as well as sensory embeddedness, and dependance of existence on actions, presenting a bottleneck for the feasibility of artificial consciousness."
