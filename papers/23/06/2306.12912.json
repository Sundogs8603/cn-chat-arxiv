    "abstract": "The insurance industry is heavily reliant on predictions of risks based on characteristics of potential customers. Although the use of said models is common, researchers have long pointed out that such practices perpetuate discrimination based on sensitive features such as gender or race. Given that such discrimination can often be attributed to historical data biases, an elimination or at least mitigation is desirable. With the shift from more traditional models to machine-learning based predictions, calls for greater mitigation have grown anew, as simply excluding sensitive variables in the pricing process can be shown to be ineffective. In this article, we first investigate why predictions are a necessity within the industry and why correcting biases is not as straightforward as simply identifying a sensitive variable. We then propose to ease the biases through the use of Wasserstein barycenters instead of simple scaling. To demonstrate the effects and effectiveness of the approach ",

    "translated_abstract": "保险业严重依赖于根据潜在客户的特征预测风险的模型。虽然这样的模型很常见，但研究人员长期以来一直指出，这种做法会因基于敏感特征（如性别或种族）而产生歧视。鉴于这种歧视通常可以归因于历史数据偏见，因此消除或至少缓解歧视是可取的。随着从更传统的模型转向基于机器学习的预测，对更大的缓解呼声也在增加，因为仅仅排除价格过程中的敏感变量被证明是无效的。在本文中，我们首先研究为什么预测在行业内是必要的，以及为什么纠正偏见并不像简单地识别敏感变量那么直接。然后，我们提出使用Wasserstein重心来缓解偏见，而不是简单地缩放。为了展示这种方法的效果和有效性",
