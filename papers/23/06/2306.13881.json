    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了CDII-PINNs方法，它是一种在Tikhonov正则化框架下使用PINNs求解CDII的计算高效方法。该方法通过将正则化的最小二乘输出函数与描述电导和电压之间关系的基本微分方程相结合，构造了一个物理启发式损失函数。表示电导和电压的一对神经网络通过该损失函数进行耦合。最小化损失函数提供了重建结果。我们提供了严格的理论保证。我们通过对网络参数的先验选择，给出了CDII-PINNs的误差分析和收敛速率，这是依据样本数量而定的。数值模拟表明，CDII-PINNs具有高效、准确和鲁棒性，可以适用于$1\\%$到$20\\%$的噪声水平。",
