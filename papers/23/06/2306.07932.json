    "translated_abstract": "尽管强大的语言模型和思维链提示的出现使自动化变得越来越无处不在，但有时在长期或多步逻辑推理方面显示出其弱点。例如，用户在没有人类参与的情况下不总能得到复杂数学问题的理想答案。在这个背景下，我们提出了手动校正系统（MCS）——一个通过思维链提示增强的人工参与系统，探究了理性中子逻辑的手动校正如何提高LLM的推理性能。更进一步考虑到有人参与的系统不仅要提高性能，还要控制成本。因此，我们提出了基于古典经济理论的人在循环链中成本效用分析模型（CAMLOP）来分析、量化和平衡效用和相应的成本。我们使用12个数据集对MCS和CAMLOP进行了实验。",
