    "abstract": "We test the international applicability of Friedman s famous plucking theory of the business cycle in 12 advanced economies between 1970 and 2021. We find that in countries where labour markets are flexible (Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and United States), unemployment rates typically return to pre-recession levels, in line with Friedman s theory. Elsewhere, unemployment rates are less cyclical. Output recoveries differ less across countries, but more across episodes: on average, half of the decline in GDP during a recession persists. In terms of sectors, declines in manufacturing are typically fully reversed. In contrast, construction-driven recessions, which are often associated with bursting property price bubbles, tend to be persistent.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究测试了弗里德曼著名的企业周期颤动理论在1970年至2021年间12个发达经济体中的国际适用性。研究发现，对于劳动力市场灵活的国家（澳大利亚、加拿大、英国和美国），失业率通常会回到经济危机前的水平，符合弗里德曼理论。在其他国家，失业率的波动性较小。产出复苏在各国之间差异较小，但在不同的经济周期之间差异较大：平均而言，在经济衰退期间GDP下降的一半仍然会持续存在。在行业方面，制造业下降通常会完全逆转。相比之下，建筑业驱动的经济衰退，通常是与房地产价格泡沫破裂有关的，往往是持续性的。",
