A randomized group-regularized optimization problem is studied. The added randomization allows us to construct a post-selection likelihood which we show to be adequate for selective inference when conditioning on the event of the selection of the grouped covariates. This likelihood also provides a selective point estimator, accounting for the selection by the group lasso. Confidence regions for the regression parameters in the selected model take the form of Wald-type regions and are shown to have bounded volume.

The method involves a randomized group-regularized optimization problem and shows promising results in constructing adequate post-selection likelihood and point estimators, as well as confidence regions with bounded volume. The proposed method is illustrated on data from the national health and nutrition examination survey."
