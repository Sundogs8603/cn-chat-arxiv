    "translated_abstract": "现有的交通信号控制系统依赖于过于简化的基于规则的方法，甚至基于强化学习的方法也经常是次优的和不稳定的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个合作的多目标架构，称为多目标多智能体深度确定性策略梯度（MOMA-DDPG），使用衰减权重来估计交通信号控制优化的多个奖励项。我们的方法涉及两种类型的智能体：一个专注于优化每个路口的本地交通，而另一个旨在优化全局交通吞吐量。我们使用从一个亚洲国家的交通摄像头收集到的真实世界交通数据来评估我们的方法。尽管包含了一个全局智能体，但我们的解决方案仍然是分散的，因为这个智能体在推理阶段不再是必要的。我们的结果证明了MOMA-DDPG的有效性，在所有性能指标上优于最先进的方法。此外，我们提出的系统最小化了等待时间和碳排放量两方面的问题。",
