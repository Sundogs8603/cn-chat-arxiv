    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the issue of hate speech by presenting a novel task of translating hate speech into non-hate speech text while preserving its meaning. As a case study, we use Spanish texts. We provide a dataset and several baselines as a starting point for further research in the task. We evaluated our baseline results using multiple metrics, including BLEU scores. The aim of this study is to contribute to the development of more effective methods for reducing the spread of hate speech in online communities.",
