    "abstract": "This study probes the effects of Japan's traditional alphabetical surname-based call system on students' experiences and long-term behavior. It reveals that early listed surnames enhance cognitive and non-cognitive skill development. The adoption of mixed-gender lists since the 1980s has amplified this effect, particularly for females. Furthermore, the study uncovers a strong correlation between childhood surname order and individuals' intention for COVID-19 revaccination, while changes in adulthood surnames do not exhibit the same influence. The implications for societal behaviors and policy are substantial and wide-ranging.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了日本传统的按姓氏字母顺序点名制度对学生经历和长期行为的影响。结果表明，提前列出的姓氏有助于认知和非认知技能的发展。自1980年代以来采用的混合性别名单加强了这种影响，特别是对女性。此外，该研究揭示了童年姓氏顺序与个人COVID-19再次接种意愿之间存在强烈的相关性，而成年后的姓氏变化则不具有相同的影响。这对社会行为和政策的影响是重大而广泛的。",
