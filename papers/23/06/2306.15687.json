    "translated_abstract": "大规模生成模型，如GPT和DALL-E已经改变了自然语言处理和计算机视觉研究的方式。这些模型不仅可以生成高质量的文本或图像输出，而且还是通用的，可以解决未被明确教授的任务。相比之下，语音生成模型在规模和任务通用化方面仍然比较原始。在本文中，我们介绍了Voicebox，这是最多功能的面向规模的文本引导生成模型。Voicebox是一个非自回归的流匹配模型，通过在音频上下文和文本条件下进行训练，用50,000小时的未经过滤或增强的语音进行填充。与GPT类似，Voicebox可以通过上下文学习执行多种不同的任务，但更加灵活，因为它还可以对未来的上下文进行条件约束。Voicebox可以用于单语或跨语言零样本的文本到语音合成，噪声去除，内容编辑，风格转换和多样化的样本生成。特别是，Voicebox",
