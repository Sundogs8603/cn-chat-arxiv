    "abstract": "We study the properties of conformal prediction for network data under various sampling mechanisms that commonly arise in practice but often result in a non-representative sample of nodes. We interpret these sampling mechanisms as selection rules applied to a superpopulation and study the validity of conformal prediction conditional on an appropriate selection event. We show that the sampled subarray is exchangeable conditional on the selection event if the selection rule satisfies a permutation invariance property and a joint exchangeability condition holds for the superpopulation. Our result implies the finite-sample validity of conformal prediction for certain selection events related to ego networks and snowball sampling. We also show that when data are sampled via a random walk on a graph, a variant of weighted conformal prediction yields asymptotically valid prediction sets for an independently selected node from the population.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了针对常见非代表性节点采样机制下的网络数据符合性预测的性质。我们将这些采样机制解释为应用于超总体的选择规则，并在适当的选择事件条件下研究符合性预测的有效性。我们证明了，如果选择规则满足置换不变性和超总体具有联合可交换性条件，则采样子阵列在选择事件条件下是可交换的。我们的结果意味着对于与自我网络和雪球抽样相关的某些选择事件，符合性预测具有有限样本有效性。我们还表明，当数据通过图上的随机游走来采样时，加权符合性预测的变体可以对人口独立选择节点的预测集进行渐近有效的预测。",
