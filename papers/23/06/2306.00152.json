In this work, we assume a semi-supervised learning setting, where the class of a small percentage of nodes is initially provided, and we propose a parameter-free Laplacian-regularized model that learns an optimal nonlinear combination of the different layers from the available input labels.

    "translated_abstract": "在多层图上进行聚类（或社区检测）会面临一些额外的复杂性问题，因为不同的层可以通过不同的结构和信息类型进行特征化。其中一个主要的挑战是确定每个层对于群集分配的贡献程度，从而有效地利用多层结构，并改进使用单个层或它们的联合获得的分类。然而，对于层的聚类信息内容做出知情的预先评估可能非常复杂。在这项工作中，我们假设半监督学习环境，在最初提供少量节点的类别的情况下，提出一个无参数的拉普拉斯正则化模型，通过可用输入标签学习不同层之间的最佳非线性组合。学习算法基于带有不精确梯度的Frank-Wolfe优化方案。",
