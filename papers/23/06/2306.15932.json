    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）是一种保护隐私的分布式机器学习方法，已被广泛应用于无线通信网络。FL使得物联网客户端可以在防止隐私泄漏的情况下获得良好训练的模型。如果将FL与边缘设备结合使用，可以在边缘直接处理视频数据，从而将人员检测部署在计算能力有限的边缘设备上。然而，由于不同相机的硬件和部署场景不同，相机所收集的数据呈现非独立和同分布（non-IID）的特性，FL聚合得到的全局模型的效果较差。同时，现有研究缺乏用于研究物联网相机上非独立和同分布问题的公共数据集。因此，我们开源了一个非独立和同分布的物联网人体检测（NIPD）数据集，该数据集由五个不同的相机收集而来。据我们所知，这是第一个真正基于设备的非独立和同分布的人体检测数据集。",
