    "translated_abstract": "轻量级数据压缩是一种关键技术，它使得列式存储在分析查询方面展示出卓越的性能。尽管之前有关基于字典编码来逼近Shannon熵的研究已经很全面，但鲜有之前的工作系统地利用列的序列相关性来进行压缩。在本文中，我们提出了LeCo（即学习压缩），这是一种使用机器学习自动消除序列冗余以实现出色的压缩比和解压缩性能的框架。LeCo提供了一种通用的方法来实现这一目标，在我们的框架下，现有的（临时的）算法，如参考帧（Frame-of-Reference），Delta编码和游程编码（Run-Length Encoding）都是特例。我们对三个合成数据集和六个真实数据集进行的微基准测试显示，LeCo原型在压缩比和随机访问速度上相比现有解决方案取得了帕累托改进。当将LeCo集成时",
