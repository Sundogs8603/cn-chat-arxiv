    "translated_abstract": "随着信用卡用户数量的增加，在这一领域检测欺诈已成为至关重要的问题。以往的研究应用了各种监督和无监督机器学习方法来寻求有效的欺诈检测系统。然而，一些方法需要大量时间才能达到合理的准确性。本文采用了无性繁殖优化算法（ARO）方法，这是一种用于检测信用卡欺诈的监督方法。通过仅从多数类进行采样，ARO方法能够提高分类的有效性。与当前数据集上实施的最佳方法之一的人工免疫系统（AIS）进行比较，结果表明所提出的方法能够显着降低所需的训练时间，并在重要的欺诈检测问题中增加召回率。实验表明，所提出的ARO方法在时间效率和准确性方面优于其他现有方法。",
