    "translated_abstract": "关系抽取旨在识别文本中实体之间的关系，从而获取关系事实，弥合自然语言和结构化知识之间的差距。然而，当前的关系抽取模型往往依赖于小型数据集，对于非英语语言的关系类型覆盖率也较低。本文提出了两个新的资源，可用于培训和评估多语言关系抽取系统。其一，我们提供了一个自动标注的数据集——SRED$^{\\rm FM}$，涵盖了18种语言、400种关系类型、13种实体类型，总共超过4000万个三元组实例。其二，我们提出了一个经人工修订的、针对七种语言的数据集——RED$^{\\rm FM}$，可用于多语言关系抽取系统的评估。为了展示这些新数据集的实用性，我们使用第一个端到端的多语言关系抽取模型mREBEL进行实验，包括实体类型在内的三元组被抽取出来。",
