    "translated_abstract": "运动规划是机器人应用中不可或缺的部分，比如自动驾驶、外科手术机器人和工业手臂。现有的规划方法在高维空间中缺乏可扩展性，而最近的基于学习的规划器在加速基于采样的运动规划器方面显示出了潜力，但在适用于分布外环境方面缺乏普适性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新方法，即矢量量化运动规划Transformer（VQ-MPT），克服了以前学习方法的关键普适性和扩展性缺点。VQ-MPT包括两个阶段。第一阶段是矢量量化—变分自动编码器模型，通过有限数量的采样分布学习表示规划空间，第二阶段是自回归模型，通过从学习的采样分布集中选择来构建SMP的采样区域。通过将大规划空间分割为离散集合并选择性地选择采样区域，我们的方法能够提高普适性和可扩展性。",
