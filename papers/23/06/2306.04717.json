    "translated_abstract": "随着文本到图像生成模型的快速发展，人工智能生成的图像（AGIs）已广泛应用于娱乐、教育、社交媒体等领域。然而，考虑到不同AGIs之间的大量质量差异，迫切需要与人类主观评分一致的质量模型。为了解决这个问题，我们广泛考虑了各种流行的AGI模型、不同提示和模型参数生成的AGI，并收集了感知质量和文本到图像对齐方面的主观评分，从而建立了迄今为止最为全面的AGI主观质量数据库AGIQA-3K。此外，我们在这个数据库上进行了基准实验，评估了当前图像质量评估（IQA）模型与人类感知之间的一致性，同时提出了StairReward，大大提高了主观文本到图像对齐评估的性能。我们相信，AGIQA-3K中的细粒度主观评分将有助于推动AI生成图像质量评估技术的发展。",
