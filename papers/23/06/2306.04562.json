    "abstract": "This paper shows that disregarding the information effects around the European Central Bank monetary policy decision announcements biases its international spillovers. Using data from 23 economies, both Emerging and Advanced, I show that following an identification strategy that disentangles pure monetary policy shocks from information effects lead to international spillovers on industrial production, exchange rates and equity indexes which are between 2 to 3 times larger in magnitude than those arising from following the standard high frequency identification strategy. This bias is driven by pure monetary policy and information effects having intuitively opposite international spillovers. Results are present for a battery of robustness checks: for a sub-sample of ``close'' and ``further away'' countries, for both Emerging and Advanced economies, using local projection techniques and for alternative methods that control for ``information effects''. I argue that this biases may have led",

    "translated_abstract": "本文展示了无视欧洲央行货币政策决策公告周围的信息效应会导致其国际溢出失真。使用23个经济体的数据，包括新兴市场和发达市场，作者展示了遵循将纯货币政策冲击与信息效应区分开来的识别策略，将引起的国际产量、汇率和股票指数的溢出效应，其数量级比遵循标准高频率识别策略引起的溢出效应高2到3倍。这种偏差是由于纯货币政策和信息效应在国际溢出方面有直观相反的作用。对于一系列稳健性检验，如子样本“接近”和“远离”国家、新兴市场和发达市场、使用本地投影技术和控制“信息效应”的替代方法都得到了结果。作者认为这种偏差可能导致了...",

By disentangling pure monetary policy shocks from information effects, the author finds that the international spillovers on industrial production, exchange rates, and equity indexes are 2 to 3 times larger than those identified by the standard strategy."
