    "translated_abstract": "在多模态感知的推荐系统中，有意义的多模态特征的提取是实现高质量推荐的基础。通常，每个推荐框架都会使用特定的策略和工具来实现其多模态特征的提取过程。这种限制有两个原因：（一）不同的特征提取策略不利于多模态推荐框架之间的相互关联，因此无法进行有效和公平的比较；（二）由于不同的开源工具提供了大量经过预训练的深度学习模型，模型设计者无法访问共享界面来提取特征。在上述问题的基础上，我们提出了Ducho，一种用于推荐系统中多模态特征提取的统一框架。通过集成三个广泛采用的深度学习库作为后端，即TensorFlow、PyTorch和Transformers，我们提供了一个共享界面，用于提取和处理特征，每个后端都有自己的特定方法。",
