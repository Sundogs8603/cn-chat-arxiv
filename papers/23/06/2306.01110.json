    "translated_abstract": "穿戴式健康设备正在引领一种新时代的连续和非侵入性远程监测。其中一项应用是用于焦虑检测。许多焦虑检测方面的进展发生在受控实验室环境中，但噪声阻止了这些进展推广到现实世界的条件下。本研究旨在研究噪声如何影响模型性能并开发对嘈杂的现实环境具有抗干扰性和适应日常生活中混乱的模型，从而推进该领域的发展。我们尝试研究先前的方法为何失败，并使用可穿戴负荷与情感检测（WESAD）数据集，在三类分类问题（基准值 vs. 压力 vs. 愉悦）中比较不同强度噪声对机器学习模型分类生理唤醒等级的影响。在引入噪声之前，我们基准模型的性能达到了98.7％，而Schmidt 2018年的模型仅达到了80.3％。我们讨论了可能的解决方法。",
