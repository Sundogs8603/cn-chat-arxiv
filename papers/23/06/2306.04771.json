    "abstract": "In Wyeth v. Levine the Supreme Court once again failed to reconcile the interpretive presumption against preemption with the sometimes competing Chevron doctrine of deference to agencies' reasonable statutory interpretations. Rather than resolve the issue of which principle should govern where the two principles point toward opposite results, the Court continued its recent practice of applying both principles halfheartedly, carving exceptions, and giving neither its proper weight.  This analysis situates Wyeth within the larger framework of the Court's recent preemption decisions in an effort to explain the Court's hesitancy to resolve the conflict. The analysis concludes that the Court, motivated by its strong respect for congressional intent and concern to protect federalism, applies both the presumption against preemption and the Chevron doctrine on a sliding scale.

    "translated_abstract": "在Wyeth v. Levine案件中，最高法院再次未能调和反对先占的解释推定和对机构合理法定解释的Chevron原则之间的竞争。法院没有解决两个原则指向相反结果的问题，而是继续其近期的做法，不彻底地应用两个原则，挑剔地开出例外，并没有给予它们充分的重视。这项分析将Wyeth置于法院最近的先占性决定的更大框架之中，以解释法院不愿解决冲突的踌躇不前。分析认为，法院出于对国会意图的尊重和对联邦主义的保护的关切，将反对先占的假设和Chevron原则应用于一个滑动规模上。当国会意图很明确，但只是模糊的范围时，法院通常非常顺从于机构的解释。",
