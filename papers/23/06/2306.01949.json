    "translated_abstract": "Park等人（《自然》2023年）对科学出版物和专利引用网络进行的最近分析表明，随着时间的推移，出版物和专利变得不那么具有破坏性。在这里，我们展示了这种报告中破坏力下降的情况是与创新系统容量无关的引用网络结构的系统性变化的产物。相反，这种下降是由于“引用通货膨胀”，这是真实引用网络的不可避免的特点，表现为系统性的时间依赖偏差，并使跨时间分析变得具有挑战性。引用通货膨胀的一个驱动因素是随着时间的推移，引用列表的长度越来越长，这反过来又增加了引用网络中链接的密度，导致破坏指数收敛于0。第二个驱动因素归因于参考文献列表构建的变化，这受到自引用的影响，自引用增加了引用网络中三元闭合率的速率，因此混淆了评估结果。",
