    "abstract": "PhotoBook is a collaborative dialogue game where two players receive private, partially-overlapping sets of images and resolve which images they have in common. It presents machines with a great challenge to learn how people build common ground around multimodal context to communicate effectively. Methods developed in the literature, however, cannot be deployed to real gameplay since they only tackle some subtasks of the game, and they require additional reference chains inputs, whose extraction process is imperfect. Therefore, we propose a reference chain-free listener model that directly addresses the game's predictive task, i.e., deciding whether an image is shared with partner. Our DeBERTa-based listener model reads the full dialogue, and utilizes CLIPScore features to assess utterance-image relevance. We achieve >77% accuracy on unseen sets of images/game themes, outperforming baseline by >17 points.",

    "translated_abstract": "PhotoBook是一种协作对话游戏，其中两个玩家收到私有的、部分重叠的图像集，并解决它们共有哪些图像。它向机器提出了一个巨大的挑战，即学习如何建立共同基础以有效地沟通。然而，文献中开发的方法不能用于真实的游戏，因为它们只解决了游戏的某些子任务，而且它们需要额外的参考链输入，其提取过程是不完美的。因此，我们提出了一个无参考链的听者模型，直接解决游戏的预测任务，即决定一个图像是否与伙伴共享。我们的DeBERTa-based听者模型读取完整的对话，并利用CLIPScore特征评估话语-图像的相关性。我们在未见过的图像集/游戏主题上实现了>77%的准确率，优于基线>17个百分点。",
