    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络提供了一种建模天气条件的替代范例。神经模型在数据可用时以少于1秒的速度进行预测，并以非常高的时间和空间分辨率进行预测。它们可以直接从大气观测数据中进行学习，这是这些模型独特的优势之一。然而，迄今为止，仅仅预测降水这一唯一变量时，仅能使用大气观测数据来训练神经模型，才能达到与现有概率性数值天气预报模型相当的良好表现到12个小时的提前量。本文提出了MetNet-3，它显著扩展了基于观测数据的神经模型能够良好预测的引导时间范围和变量。MetNet-3从密集和稀疏的数据传感器中学习，并为降水、风、温度和露点进行24小时的预测。MetNet-3在体系结构层面引入了许多技术创新，这被证明对提高模型性能有所贡献，包括可学习的时空卷积、基于注意力的特征学习和多任务训练优化。此外，我们展示了将神经模型泛化为仅接受稀疏的气压计观测数据作为输入，并通过使用简单的持续性启发法来外推初始条件，或通过使用低分辨率数值模型进行短期预测来填补缺失的观测数据的方法是有益的。MetNet-3在降水、温度和露点预测方面比现有的大气模型在提前至24小时方面表现更好。",

    "en_tdlr": "This work proposes a deep learning model, MetNet-3, that can accurately predict weather conditions up to 24 hours ahead using sparse observations. Technical innovations include learnable convolutions, attention-based feature learning, and multi-tasking training optimization. The model outperforms state-of-the-art models for precipitation, temperature, and dew point forecasts. Simple persistence heuristics are also used to improve predictions by extrapolating initial conditions or filling missing data with short-term predictions."
