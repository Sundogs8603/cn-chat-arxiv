We investigate the potential of large pre-trained speech models for facilitating reviews, focusing on ASR and officer speech detection in footage from traffic stops. Our proposed pipeline includes training data alignment and filtering, fine-tuning with resource constraints, and combining officer speech detection with ASR for a fully automated approach. We find that (1) fine-tuning strongly improves ASR performance on officer speech (WER=12-13%), (2) ASR on officer speech is much more accurate than on community member speech (WER=43.55-49.07%), (3) domain-specific tasks like officer speech detection and diarization remain challenging.

    "translated_abstract": "警用身体佩戴摄像头具有提高警务透明度和问责的潜力。然而，在实践中，它们会产生数百万小时的未被审查的录音数据。我们探讨了大规模预训练语音模型在促进审查方面的潜力，重点关注交通站点录音中的语音识别和警员讲话检测。我们提出的流水线包括数据对齐和过滤、受资源限制的微调，以及将警员讲话检测与ASR相结合，实现完全自动化的方法。我们发现(1)微调大大提高了警员讲话ASR的性能(WER=12-13%)，(2)警员讲话的ASR比社区成员的ASR更准确(WER=43.55-49.07%)，(3)像警员讲话检测和日记化这样的特定领域任务仍然具有挑战性。我们的工作为审查身体摄像头录音提供了实际应用，并为适应嘈杂的多音箱领域的预训练语音模型提供了一般指导。",
