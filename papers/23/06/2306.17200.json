    "abstract": "The accuracy of finger vein recognition systems gets degraded due to low and uneven contrast between veins and surroundings, often resulting in poor detection of vein patterns. We propose a finger-vein enhancement technique, ResFPN (Residual Feature Pyramid Network), as a generic preprocessing method agnostic to the recognition pipeline. A bottom-up pyramidal architecture using the novel Structure Detection block (SDBlock) facilitates extraction of veins of varied widths. Using a feature aggregation module (FAM), we combine these vein-structures, and train the proposed ResFPN for detection of veins across scales. With enhanced presentations, our experiments indicate a reduction upto 5% in the average recognition errors for commonly used recognition pipeline over two publicly available datasets. These improvements are persistent even in cross-dataset scenario where the dataset used to train the ResFPN is different from the one used for recognition.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于血管和周围环境之间的低对比度和不均匀性，指静脉识别系统的准确性受到损害，常常导致血管图案的检测效果不佳。我们提出了一种指静脉增强技术，ResFPN（残差特征金字塔网络），作为一种通用的预处理方法，与识别流程无关。使用新颖的结构检测块（SDBlock），通过自底向上的金字塔结构提取不同宽度的血管结构。利用特征聚合模块（FAM），我们将这些血管结构组合起来，并训练所提出的ResFPN来检测不同尺度上的血管。通过增强展示，我们的实验结果表明，在两个公开数据集上，常用的识别流程的平均识别错误率减少了高达5%。即使在交叉数据集的情况下，所用于训练ResFPN的数据集与用于识别的数据集不同，这些改进仍然持续存在。",
