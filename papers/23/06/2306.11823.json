    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了EvolveMT，它可以高效地组合多个机器翻译（MT）引擎。该系统通过利用在线学习技术为每个段落选择单个引擎的输出，以预测每个翻译请求的最合适系统。神经质量估计度量监督该方法，无需参考翻译。该系统的在线学习能力允许动态适应领域或机器翻译引擎的改变，因此消除了额外训练的必要性。 EvolveMT基于源语句特征选择要调用的翻译引擎子集。探索程度可根据所需的质量-成本平衡进行配置。定制数据集的结果表明，EvolveMT在成本更低的情况下实现了类似于从所有翻译中选择每个段落的最佳翻译的MT质量估计器所实现的翻译准确性。据我们所知，EvolveMT是第一个仅通过使用自身改进的集成MT引擎。",
