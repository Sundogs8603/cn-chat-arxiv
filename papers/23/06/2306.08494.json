    "translated_abstract": "我们重新审视了从一个具有 $\\mathbb R^p$ 中任意位置的平滑且强对数凹密度目标分布中采样的问题。在这种情况下，如果没有额外的密度信息可用，随机中点划分对于动力学 Langevin 扩散是已知的最可扩展的高维方法，具有大的条件数。我们的主要结果是对这种方法的Wasserstein-2误差的一种非渐进且易于计算的上限。为了更全面地解释建立可计算的上限的方法，我们对香农熵和中点划分进行了分析，以便阐明基本原理并提供有价值的见解，从而确立了与中点划分的动力学 Langevin 进程有关的改进上限。此外，通过应用这些技术，我们为采用欧拉划分的动力学 Langevin 进程建立了新的保证。",
