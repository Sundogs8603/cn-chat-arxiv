    "translated_abstract": "微型机器人在有针对性的药物输送中具有很大的潜力。然而，由于其微小的尺寸，单独控制每个机器人是困难的。因此，使用单一控制器控制多个机器人非常重要，而人工智能可以帮助我们成功完成这个任务。在本研究中，我们使用强化学习算法Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)和Robust Policy Optimization (RPO)来控制一群微型游泳机器人，在受水动力学效应控制的情况下，将它们的方向朝向一个圆形吸收目标。我们考查了PPO和RPO在有限状态信息情景下的表现，并测试了它们在随机目标位置和大小的情况下的鲁棒性。我们使用课程学习来提高性能，并在学习控制一群25个游泳机器人并将它们导航到一个展示目标的实验中证明了这一点。",
