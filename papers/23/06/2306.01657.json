    "translated_abstract": "共情是开放式交流中至关重要的因素，它自然地展示了一个人对他人的关心和理解。虽然已经提出了几种生成共情响应的方法，但现有的作品往往导致单调的共情，即指通用和安全的表达方式。本文提出使用显式控制来引导共情表达，并设计了一个DiffusEmp框架，基于条件扩散语言模型，统一了对话上下文和属性导向控制信号的利用。具体而言，引入通信机制、意图和语义框架作为多层次信号，可从粗糙到细致地控制共情实现。然后我们设计了一个特定的屏蔽策略，以反映多层次信号与响应令牌之间的关系，并将其整合到扩散模型中以影响生成过程。实验结果在基准数据集EmpatheticDialogue上表明，我们的框架优于其他共情回应生成方法。",
