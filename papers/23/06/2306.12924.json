    "translated_abstract": "波兰是欧洲性别薪酬差距最小的国家之一。与此同时，它是一个保守的国家，女性的权利一直在下降。我们认为，在波兰背景下，收入差距比小时工资差距更适合衡量性别劳动力市场结果。我们使用调整为低分辨率的安慰剂事件历史方法和波兰世代和性别调查的两个波次（2010年、2014年）分析了波兰的收入性别差距与育儿状态的关系。与在西欧进行的类似研究相反，我们的分析揭示了女性和男性普遍存在的预期行为。我们展示，在生育后，母亲的收入降低了约20％，但在15年后，与非母亲的收入轨迹趋于一致。相比之下，未来父亲的收入高于非父亲的收入，这表明父亲溢价在孩子到来之前就存在。总的来说，我们的研究揭示了一个保守的国家中性别劳动力市场结果的复杂性。",
