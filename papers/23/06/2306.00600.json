Recently, the Complex AutoEncoder was proposed as an alternative that learns continuous and distributed object-centric representations. However, it is only applicable to simple toy data. In this paper, we present Rotating Features, a generalization of complex-valued features to higher dimensions, and a new evaluation procedure for extracting objects from distributed representations.

    "translated_abstract": "人类认知中的绑定问题涉及大脑如何在固定的神经连接网络中表示和连接物体，仍然存在激烈的争论。大多数无监督学习的机器学习方法都集中在基于插槽的方法上，由于其离散性和难以表达不确定性的特点，可能有一定的局限性。最近，复杂自动编码器被提出作为一个学习连续和分布式以物体为中心的代替方法。然而，它只适用于简单的玩具数据。在本文中，我们提出了旋转特征，将复值特征推广到更高维度，并提出了一种提取分布式表示中物体的新评估方法。此外，我们展示了我们的方法对预训练特征的适用性。这些进展使我们能够从简单的玩具数据扩展到真实世界数据中的分布式以物体为中心的表示。",
