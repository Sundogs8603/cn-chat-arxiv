    "translated_abstract": "在深度学习中，类别不平衡问题已经在多个研究中被探讨过，但目前还没有对目标检测中的这个现象进行系统的分析。本文针对目标检测中广泛存在的前景-背景（F-B）不平衡问题进行了全面的分析和实验，该问题往往是由于小的、不频繁出现的感兴趣对象引起的。我们实验性地研究了F-B不平衡的不同方面（目标大小、目标数量、数据集大小、目标类型）对检测性能的影响。另外，我们还比较了9种主流方法来解决这个问题，包括Faster-RCNN、SSD、OHEM、Libra-RCNN、Focal-Loss、GHM、PISA、YOLO-v3和GFL，并使用来自不同成像领域的数据集进行了实验。我们得出以下结论：（1）F-B不平衡确实会导致检测性能显著下降，（2）当训练数据较少时，检测性能更受到F-B不平衡的影响，（3）大多数情况下，减小目标大小会增加F-B不平衡的影响。",

Additionally, decreasing object size increases the impact of the imbalance problem."
