    "translated_abstract": "许多应用，比如共享交通，需要协调大量的智能体。均场强化学习通过优化代表性智能体的策略来应对由此带来的可扩展性挑战。在本文中，我们解决了一个重要的泛化问题，即智能体分布存在全局约束的情况（例如需要满足容量约束或最小覆盖要求）。我们提出了Safe-$\\text{M}^3$-UCRL，这是第一个能够在未知转移动态的情况下实现安全策略的基于模型的算法。作为一个关键因素，它在保证悲观约束满足的同时，利用转移模型中的认知不确定性来使用对数障碍方法确保高概率。我们在许多共享交通运营商面临的车辆重定位问题上展示了Safe-$\\text{M}^3$-UCRL，并通过基于深圳出租车轨迹数据的仿真评估其性能。我们的算法能够有效满足关键需求。",
