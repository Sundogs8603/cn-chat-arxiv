    "abstract": "Despite increasing interest in the automatic detection of media frames in NLP, the problem is typically simplified as single-label classification and adopts a topic-like view on frames, evading modelling the broader document-level narrative. In this work, we revisit a widely used conceptualization of framing from the communication sciences which explicitly captures elements of narratives, including conflict and its resolution, and integrate it with the narrative framing of key entities in the story as heroes, victims or villains. We adapt an effective annotation paradigm that breaks a complex annotation task into a series of simpler binary questions, and present an annotated data set of English news articles, and a case study on the framing of climate change in articles from news outlets across the political spectrum. Finally, we explore automatic multi-label prediction of our frames with supervised and semi-supervised approaches, and present a novel retrieval-based method which is bot",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管自然语言处理中对媒体框架的自动检测越来越感兴趣，但问题通常被简化为单标签分类，并采用了类似主题的框架观点，避免了对更广泛的文档级叙事进行建模。在这项工作中，我们重新审视了通信科学中广泛使用的框架概念，该概念明确捕捉了叙事的要素，包括冲突及其解决方案，并将其与叙事框架中的关键实体（英雄、受害者或反派）相结合。我们采用了一种有效的注释范式，将复杂的注释任务分解为一系列较简单的二进制问题，并提供了一份英语新闻文章的注释数据集，并在来自政治光谱的新闻媒体文章中进行了气候变化框架的案例研究。最后，我们探索了使用监督和半监督方法自动多标签预测框架，并提出了一种新颖的基于检索的方法。",
