    "translated_abstract": "尽管生成模型的数量正在增加，但在推理过程中实现快速采样而不牺牲样本多样性和质量仍然具有挑战性。现有的模型（如 DDPMS）可以提供高质量，丰富多样的样本，但受迭代步骤数量的固有限制而速度较慢。Denoising Diffusion Generative Adversarial Networks (DDGAN) 试图通过集成 GAN 模型用于扩散过程的较大跳跃来规避此限制。然而，当应用于大型数据集时，DDGAN 遇到了可扩展性限制。为了解决这些限制，我们引入了一种新的方法，通过匹配隐式和显式因子来解决问题。更具体地说，我们的方法涉及利用隐式模型来匹配嘈杂数据的边缘分布和前向扩散的显式条件分布。这种组合使我们能够有效地匹配联合去噪分布。与 DDPMS 不同，我们的半隐式去噪扩散模型（SIDDMs）可以在不影响所生成样本的多样性和质量的情况下快速收敛。",
