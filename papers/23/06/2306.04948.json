    "abstract": "With the recent progress in sports analytics, deep learning approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of mining insights into players' tactics for improving performance quality and fan engagement. This is attributed to the availability of public ground-truth datasets. While there are a few available datasets for turn-based sports for action detection, these datasets severely lack structured source data and stroke-level records since these require high-cost labeling efforts from domain experts and are hard to detect using automatic techniques. Consequently, the development of artificial intelligence approaches is significantly hindered when existing models are applied to more challenging structured turn-based sequences. In this paper, we present ShuttleSet, the largest publicly-available badminton singles dataset with annotated stroke-level records. It contains 104 sets, 3,685 rallies, and 36,492 strokes in 44 matches between 2018 and 2021 with 27 top-ranking men's singles and wome",

    "translated_abstract": "随着体育分析的最新进展，深度学习方法已经展示出挖掘球员战术洞察力以提高表现质量和球迷参与度的有效性。这归因于公共基础真实数据集的可用性。虽然有一些用于行动检测的回合比赛的可用数据集，但这些数据集严重缺乏结构化的来源数据和拍级记录，因为这些需要来自领域专家的高成本标记工作，并且很难使用自动技术检测到。因此，当现有模型应用于更具挑战性的结构化回合序列时，人工智能方法的开发受到重大制约。在本文中，我们介绍了 ShuttleSet，这是最大的公开羽毛球单打比赛的拍级记录数据集。它包括2018年至2021年间的44场比赛中的104盘比赛，3,685轮比赛和36,492个拍击，并涵盖了27名排名前列的男子和女子单打选手。",
