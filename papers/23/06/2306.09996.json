    "translated_abstract": "视觉问答（VQA）是一项具有挑战性的任务，需要具备理解和推理视觉信息的能力。虽然近期的视觉语言模型取得了进展，但它们在零样本VQA方面仍然存在问题，特别是在处理复杂组合问题和适应新领域，如基于知识的推理方面。本文探讨了各种提示策略的使用，重点关注BLIP2模型，以提高零样本VQA的性能。我们在几个VQA数据集上进行了全面调查，研究了不同问题模板的有效性、少量样本示例的作用、思维链推理的影响以及将图像标题作为额外视觉线索融合的好处。尽管结果各异，但我们的发现表明，精心设计的问题模板和整合额外视觉线索（如图像标题）可以促进VQA性能的提高，特别是当它们结合使用时。",
