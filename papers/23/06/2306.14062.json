    "translated_abstract": "漏洞和攻击的数量、种类和速度的变化使得人类专家和经验在事件威胁分析中变得困难。MITRE AT＆CK框架使用战术、技术和程序（TTP）描述攻击者如何和为何利用漏洞。但是，一个安全专业人士撰写的TTP描述可能被另一个人解释得非常不同，这会导致网络安全操作甚至商业、政策和法律决策的混淆。与此同时，人工智能的进步已经导致自然语言处理（NLP）算法在网络操作中的各种任务中的增加使用。随着大型语言模型（LLM）的兴起，由于LLM的语义理解和可扩展性，NLP任务得到了显着的改善。这让我们质疑LLM在如何解释TTP或一般网络攻击描述方面的表现。我们提出并分析了直接使用LLMs以及训练BaseLLMs以描述TTP并评估结果。我们的实验证明了以相关文本数据训练的BaseLLM大大改善了TTP的解释，并可以胜过领域专家的解释能力。我们还讨论了使用LLMs进行网络威胁情报分析的影响和局限性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the use of large language models to interpret ambiguous cyberattack descriptions and demonstrates that a BaseLLM trained on relevant text data can significantly improve the interpretation of attack techniques and outperform domain-expert interpretability. The implications and limitations of using LLMs for cyber threat intelligence analysis are also discussed."
