    "translated_abstract": "Maji等人在2002年提出了一种使用软集作为工具的参数化决策制定方法，并将它们的表格形式表示为二进制矩阵。然而，在某些情况下，用于描述全集元素特征的某些或所有参数具有模糊的质地时，他们的方法并不总是给出最佳的决策制定解决方案。为了解决这个问题，我们在早期的研究中修改了Maji等人的方法，通过将相应的软集的表格形式中的二进制元素替换为灰色数字或三角形模糊数字。在本文中，为了更有效地解决决策制定人对分配给某些或所有元素的模糊/定性特征的正确性存在疑虑的情况，我们将表格形式的二进制元素替换为中性三元组。我们的新的、中性决策制定方法是通过一个有关选择新PL的应用来说明的。",
