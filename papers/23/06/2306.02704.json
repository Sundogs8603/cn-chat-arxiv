    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了标准史塔克伯格博弈（SG）框架的一种推广：校准史塔克伯格博弈（CSG）。在CSG中，一个主体与一个智能体反复交互，后者不像标准SG一样直接访问主体的动作，而是对其进行校准预测，以达到最佳响应。CSG是一个强大的建模工具，超越了假定代理使用特定算法进行战略交互的做法，因此更加鲁棒地应对了SG最初旨在捕捉的现实应用。除了CSG外，本文还介绍了更强的校准概念，称为自适应校准，可针对敌对序列提供精细的任何时候校准保证。本文给出了获得自适应校准算法的一般方法，并将其专门用于有限CSG。在我们的主要技术结果中，我们证明在CSG中，主体可以获得收敛于最优解的效用。",
