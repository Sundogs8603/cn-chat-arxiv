    "translated_abstract": "随着新型未知（零日）攻击的出现和易受攻击的设备的兴起，网络系统面临着日益增加的网络攻击威胁。虽然基于机器学习的入侵检测系统在检测这些攻击方面已经显示出极大的潜力，但需要学习大量标记数据的需求经常限制了仅有私有本地数据访问的网络系统应用基于机器学习的入侵检测系统的可行性。为解决这个问题，本文提出了一种新颖的分布式和在线联邦学习入侵检测（DOF-ID）架构。DOF-ID 是一种协作学习系统，允许每个用于网络系统的入侵检测系统从其他网络系统中获得的经验以及本地数据进行学习而不违反其他系统的数据隐私。通过使用公共 Kitsune 和 Bot-IoT 数据集的性能评估结果表明，DOF-ID 显著提高了所有正在协作的系统的入侵检测性能。",
