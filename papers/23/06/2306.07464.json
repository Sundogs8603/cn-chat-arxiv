    "abstract": "B2B sales requires effective prediction of customer growth, identification of upsell potential, and mitigation of churn risks. LinkedIn sales representatives traditionally relied on intuition and fragmented data signals to assess customer performance. This resulted in significant time investment in data understanding as well as strategy formulation and under-investment in active selling. To overcome this challenge, we developed a data product called Account Prioritizer, an intelligent sales account prioritization engine. It uses machine learning recommendation models and integrated account-level explanation algorithms within the sales CRM to automate the manual process of sales book prioritization. A successful A/B test demonstrated that the Account Prioritizer generated a substantial +8.08% increase in renewal bookings for the LinkedIn Business.",

    "translated_abstract": "B2B 销售需要有效预测客户增长，识别升级潜力以及降低流失风险。LinkedIn 的销售代表传统上依赖直觉和碎片化数据信号来评估客户绩效。这导致在数据理解和策略制定方面投入了大量时间，而在积极销售方面投资不足。为了克服这一挑战，我们开发了一种数据产品，称为 Account Prioritizer，它是智能销售账户优先级引擎。它使用机器学习推荐模型和集成的账户级解释算法在销售 CRM 中自动化销售簿优化的手动过程。一次成功的 A/B 测试表明，Account Prioritizer 为 LinkedIn Business 带来了显著的 +8.08% 续订订阅增长。",
