    "abstract": "We present the Minigrid and Miniworld libraries which provide a suite of goal-oriented 2D and 3D environments. The libraries were explicitly created with a minimalistic design paradigm to allow users to rapidly develop new environments for a wide range of research-specific needs. As a result, both have received widescale adoption by the RL community, facilitating research in a wide range of areas. In this paper, we outline the design philosophy, environment details, and their world generation API. We also showcase the additional capabilities brought by the unified API between Minigrid and Miniworld through case studies on transfer learning (for both RL agents and humans) between the different observation spaces.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了Minigrid和Miniworld库，这两个库提供了一套面向目标的2D和3D环境。这些库是明确采用极简主义设计范式而创建的，以允许用户快速为各种研究特定需求开发新环境，因此它们已被RL社区广泛采用，促进了各种领域的研究。在本文中，我们概述了设计理念、环境细节以及它们的世界生成API。我们还通过案例研究展示了Minigrid和Miniworld之间统一API带来的附加功能，包括在不同观测空间之间进行转移学习（针对RL代理和人类）。Minigrid和Miniworld的源代码可在https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/{Minigrid, Miniworld}找到，文档可以在https://{minigrid, miniworld}.farama.org/找到。",
