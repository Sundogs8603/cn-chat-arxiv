    "translated_abstract": "聊天机器人作为人类用户和机器之间的沟通工具，旨在基于用户输入进行适当的回答。在最近的方法中，结合自然语言处理和序列模型来构建生成式聊天机器人。这些模型的主要挑战是它们的序列性质，导致结果不够准确。为了解决这个挑战，在本文中，提出了一种新颖的架构，使用条件Wasserstein生成对抗网络和Transformer模型进行聊天机器人的答案生成。虽然所提出模型的生成器由完整的Transformer模型组成以生成答案，但鉴别器仅包括Transformer模型的编码器部分，后跟一个分类器。据我们所知，这是第一次使用嵌入式Transformer模型来提出生成式聊天机器人，其同时在生成器和鉴别器模型中使用。依靠Transformer模型的并行计算，结果具有更好的准确性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes a conditional generative chatbot using a transformer model, which addresses the accuracy issue in sequential models by combining Wasserstein generative adversarial networks and a transformer model. The generator part utilizes a complete transformer model for answer generation, while the discriminator part only employs the encoder of a transformer model, resulting in improved accuracy in generating chatbot responses."
