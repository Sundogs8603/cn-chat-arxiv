    "abstract": "This paper presents a method for building a personalized open-domain dialogue system to address the $\\textit{WWH}$ ($\\textit{WHAT}$, $\\textit{WHEN}$, and $\\textit{HOW}$) problem for natural response generation in a commercial setting, where personalized dialogue responses are heavily interleaved with casual response turns. The proposed approach involves weighted dataset blending, negative persona information augmentation methods, and the design of personalized conversation datasets to address the challenges of $\\textit{WWH}$ in personalized, open-domain dialogue systems. Our work effectively balances dialogue fluency and tendency to ground, while also introducing a response-type label to improve the controllability and explainability of the grounded responses. The combination of these methods leads to more fluent conversations, as evidenced by subjective human evaluations as well as objective evaluations.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种建立个性化开放领域对话系统以解决商业设置中涉及个性化对话响应与非正式响应交替的$\\textit{WWH}$（$\\textit{WHAT}$、$\\textit{WHEN}$和$\\textit{HOW}$）问题的方法。所提出的方法涉及加权数据集混合、负角色信息增强方法以及设计个性化对话数据集，以应对个性化、开放领域对话系统中$\\textit{WWH}$的挑战。本文有效地平衡了对话流畅性和趋向于理解对话系统，同时还引入了响应类型标签来提高可控性和解释性。这些方法的组合导致了更加流畅的对话，证明了基于主观人类评估和客观评估的实验结果。",
