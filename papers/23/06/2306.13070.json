    "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of the Anglophone Conflict in Cameroon on human capital accumulation. Using high-quality individual-level data on test scores and information on conflict-related violent events, a difference-in-differences design is employed to estimate the conflict's causal effects. The results show that an increase in violent events and conflict-related deaths causes a significant decline in test scores in reading and mathematics. The conflict also leads to higher rates of teacher absenteeism and reduced access to electricity in schools. These findings highlight the adverse consequences of conflict-related violence on human capital accumulation, particularly within the Anglophone subsystem. The study emphasizes the disproportionate burden faced by Anglophone pupils due to language-rooted tensions and segregated educational systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了喀麦隆英语裔冲突对人力资本积累的影响。利用高质量的个人水平考试成绩数据和与冲突相关的暴力事件信息，采用差分差分设计来估计冲突的因果效应。结果表明，暴力事件和与冲突相关的死亡增加会导致阅读和数学考试成绩显著下降。冲突还导致教师缺勤率和学校用电量减少。这些发现凸显了冲突相关暴力对人力资本积累的负面影响，特别是在英语裔子系统内。该研究强调了英语裔学生由于语言压力和隔离的教育体系所面临的不成比例的负担。",
