    "translated_abstract": "图形异常检测（GAD）是一种技术，用于识别图中的异常节点，在网络安全、欺诈检测、社交媒体垃圾检测和其他各种领域中有应用。GAD的常见方法是图自编码器（GAEs），它将图形数据编码成节点表示，并根据这些表示来评估图形的重构质量，以识别异常。然而，现有的GAE模型主要针对直接链接重构进行优化，导致在潜在空间中连接图中的节点被聚类。因此，它们擅长检测聚类型结构异常，但对不符合聚类的更复杂的结构异常存在困难。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一种新颖的解决方案，称为GAD-NR，它是GAE的一个新变体，融合邻域重构进行图形异常检测。GAD-NR的目标是重构节点的整个邻域，涵盖本地结构",
