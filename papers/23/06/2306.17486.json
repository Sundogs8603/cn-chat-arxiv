    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于深度学习的迭代方法来解决离散异质Helmholtz方程在高波数下的问题。通过将经典的迭代多网格求解器和卷积神经网络（CNN）与预条件技术结合起来，我们得到了一个更快且可伸缩性更好的学习型神经求解器，相比标准的多网格求解器更优。我们的方法在先前这类神经方法的基础上提出了三个主要贡献。首先，我们构建了一个多层U-Net-like编码器-求解器CNN，其中在U-Net的最粗糙网格上包含一个隐式层，卷积核被反转。这种方法缓解了CNN中的视野问题，并允许更好的可伸缩性。其次，我们在参数数量、计算时间和收敛速度方面改进了先前的CNN预条件器。第三，我们提出了一种多尺度训练方法，使网络能够扩展到之前未见过的尺寸问题，同时仍保持合理的训练过程。我们的编码器",
