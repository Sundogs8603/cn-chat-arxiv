    "translated_abstract": "面对大规模集成（VLSI）技术的发展，芯片布局中的电子设计自动化（EDA）技术面临新的挑战。宏单元布局作为该过程中的重要子问题，试图确定所有宏单元的位置，以最小化半周长线长（HPWL）并避免重叠。先前的方法包括基于打包、分析和强化学习的方法。本文提出了一种新的黑盒优化（BBO）框架（称为WireMask-BBO），通过使用线掩模引导的贪心过程进行目标评估来进行宏单元布局。配备不同的BBO算法，WireMask-BBO在实践中比先前的方法实现了显著的改进，即通过使用更少的时间实现了显著更短的HPWL。此外，它可以通过将其视为初始解来微调现有的布局，从而使HPWL改善多达50%。WireMask-BBO具有引领芯片布局领域的潜力。",
