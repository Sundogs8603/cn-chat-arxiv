While it demonstrates state-of-the-art capabilities in a variety of language-generating tasks, it also raises widespread public concerns regarding its societal impact. In this paper, we utilize natural language processing approaches to investigate the public attitudes towards ChatGPT by applying sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques to Twitter data. Our result shows that the overall sentiment is largely neutral to positive, which also holds true across different occupation groups.

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT作为一个由大型语言模型驱动的聊天机器人在用户基数增长方面创下了新记录。虽然它展示了在多种语言生成任务中的最新能力，但它也引起了广泛的公众关注，涉及其对社会的影响。本文利用自然语言处理方法，通过将情感分析和主题建模技术应用于Twitter数据来调查公众对ChatGPT的态度。我们的结果显示总体情感在很大程度上是中性到积极的，这也适用于不同的职业群体。在众多提到的主题中，最受关注的主题是人工智能、搜索引擎、教育、写作和问题回答等方面。",
