    "translated_abstract": "自动分类心电图（ECG）信号对于心血管疾病的早期预防和诊断至关重要。尽管ECG信号可用于诊断各种疾病，但其病理特征仅存在最小差异，这给自动分类模型提出了挑战。现有方法主要使用卷积神经网络来提取ECG信号特征进行分类，但可能无法完全捕捉不同疾病的病理特征差异。变压器网络在序列数据的特征提取方面具有优势，但完整的网络复杂，依赖大规模数据集。为应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种称为多尺度移位窗口变压器网络（MSW-Transformer）的单层Transformer网络，它使用不同尺度的多窗口滑动注意机制来捕捉不同维度的特征。自我注意被限制在非重叠和移位窗口内，以有效地捕捉局部特征。我们的方法在公开可用的12导ECG分类数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了MSW-Transformer在捕捉病理特征差异方面的有效性。",
