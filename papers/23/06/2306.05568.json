There are two key improvements with respect to Lo and MacKinlay's original maximally predictable portfolio approach. First, it accommodates for any (nonlinear) forecasting algorithm and predictor set. Second, it handles large portfolios.

    "translated_abstract": "对于股票回报，任何形式的可预测性都可以增强调整风险后的盈利能力。本文开发了一种协作机器学习算法，优化组合权重，以使得合成证券最大程度的可预测。具体来说，我们引入了MACE，Alternating Conditional Expectations的多元扩展，通过在方程的一侧使用随机森林和受限岭回归在另一侧实现了上述目标。相较于Lo和MacKinlay的最大可预测组合方法，本文有两个关键改进。第一，它适用于任何（非线性）预测算法和预测器集。第二，它可以处理大型组合。我们进行了日频和月频的实验，并发现在使用很少的条件信息时，可预测性和盈利能力显著增加。有趣的是，可预测性在好时和坏时都存在，并且MACE成功地导航了两者。",
