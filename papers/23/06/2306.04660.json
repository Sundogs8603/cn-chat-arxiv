    "translated_abstract": "绿灯最佳速度建议（GLOSA）系统建议车辆速度，以帮助它们在绿色时间通过路口，从而通过最小化在路口停车和怠速时间来减少交通拥堵和燃料消耗。但是，以前的研究集中于优化GLOSA算法，忽略了GLOSA系统的速度建议频率。具体而言，一些研究在每个决策步骤提供速度建议，导致冗余建议，而其他人仅为车辆计算最佳速度，无法适应动态交通。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于混合PPO（H-PPO）的自适应频率GLOSA（AF-GLOSA）模型，其采用了一个actor-critic架构和一个混合actor网络。混合演员网络包括一个离散演员，输出咨询频率和一个连续演员，输出加速度曲线。此外，我们设计了一种新的奖励函数来平衡减少停车和最小化速度变化的权衡。实验结果表明，所提出的AF-GLOSA模型可以有效地减少旅行时间和燃料消耗，并优于现有的最先进的GLOSA系统。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an Adaptive Frequency Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory model based on Hybrid Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes the frequency and acceleration profiles of the Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory system by using discrete and continuous actor networks, and balanced the trade-off between reducing stops and minimizing speed changes by designing a new reward function. Experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively reduce travel time and fuel consumption, and outperform existing state-of-the-art GLOSA systems."
