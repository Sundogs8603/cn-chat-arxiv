    "abstract": "Context. Algorithmic racism is the term used to describe the behavior of technological solutions that constrains users based on their ethnicity. Lately, various data-driven software systems have been reported to discriminate against Black people, either for the use of biased data sets or due to the prejudice propagated by software professionals in their code. As a result, Black people are experiencing disadvantages in accessing technology-based services, such as housing, banking, and law enforcement. Goal. This study aims to explore algorithmic racism from the perspective of software professionals. Method. A survey questionnaire was applied to explore the understanding of software practitioners on algorithmic racism, and data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics and coding techniques. Results. We obtained answers from a sample of 73 software professionals discussing their understanding and perspectives on algorithmic racism in software development. Our results demonstrat",

    "translated_abstract": "背景。算法种族歧视是指技术解决方案根据用户的种族而限制其行为。近期，有报道称各种数据驱动的软件系统对黑人进行歧视，原因可能是使用了带偏见的数据集，或者是由软件专业人员在代码中传播了偏见。结果，黑人在使用基于技术的服务（如住房、银行和执法）方面面临不公平的待遇。目标。本研究旨在从软件专业人员的角度探索算法种族歧视。方法。应用调查问卷来探索软件从业人员对算法种族歧视的理解，使用描述性统计和编码技术进行数据分析。结果。我们对73名软件专业人员进行了调查，并讨论了他们对软件开发中算法种族歧视的理解和观点。我们的研究结果展示了...",
