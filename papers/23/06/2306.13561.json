    "translated_abstract": "预测模式挖掘是一种用于构建预测模型的方法，当输入被表示为结构化数据（例如集合、图和序列）时，该方法适用。预测模式挖掘的主要思想是通过考虑结构化数据中的子结构（例如子集、子图和子序列，称为模式）作为模型的特征来构建预测模型。预测模式挖掘面临的主要挑战在于随着结构化数据的复杂性增加，模式数量呈指数级增长。在本研究中，我们提出了安全模式修剪（SPP）方法来解决预测模式挖掘中模式数爆炸的问题。我们还讨论了如何在实际数据分析的整个模型构建过程中有效地应用它。为了证明所提出的方法的有效性，我们在涉及集合、图和序列的回归和分类问题上进行了数值实验。",
