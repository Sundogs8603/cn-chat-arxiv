    "translated_abstract": "在动态驾驶场景（如高速公路合流）中，准确预测附近车辆的轨迹对于自动驾驶车辆的安全运动规划至关重要。现有的方法无法对车辆进行预测，除非观察了固定时长的两秒或以上。这导致车辆对于进入其感知范围的车辆无法快速反应，从而产生安全隐患。因此，本文提出了一种新颖的基于Transformer的轨迹预测方法，特别训练以处理观察长度大于一帧的任何情况。我们使用两个大型高速公路轨迹数据集（highD和exiD）对所提出的方法进行了全面评估。此外，我们使用exiD数据集中的广泛合并场景研究了所提出的预测方法对运动规划和控制任务的影响。据我们所知，这是首次采用这样一个大型高速公路合流数据集进行研究。",
