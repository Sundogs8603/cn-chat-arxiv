    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是一种协作训练机器学习模型的方法，用于多个参与方之间禁止数据共享。在联邦学习中的一个挑战是客户端之间的非独立同分布数据，因为单个模型无法适应所有客户端的数据分布。为了解决这个问题，介绍了元学习（如Per-FedAvg）。元学习学习适用于所有客户端的共享初始参数。每个客户端使用梯度下降法将初始化快速调整到本地数据分布，实现模型个性化。然而，由于非凸损失函数和采样更新的随机性，元学习方法在本地适应同一客户端时具有不稳定的目标。这种不同适应方向的波动阻碍了元学习的收敛。为了克服这个挑战，我们使用了历史本地调整的模型来限制内循环的方向，并提出了一种弹性约束方法。",
