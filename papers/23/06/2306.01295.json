    "translated_abstract": "在不同环境中完成任务对于采取行动的机器人代理来说面临着重大挑战，尤其是在对象类型上的泛化以及执行适当的行动以完成任务。本文提出了自我中心规划，一种创新的方法，将符号规划和面向对象的POMDP结合起来，以解决复杂环境下的任务，利用现有的视觉感知和自然语言处理模型。我们在ALFRED（一个模拟的家庭任务环境）中评估了我们的方法，并展示了其高可扩展性，在ALFRED基准测试中取得了惊人的36.07%的未见过的成功率，并在CVPR Emobodied AI workshop中获得了ALFRED挑战赛的胜利。我们的方法需要可靠的感知，并规定或学习关于代理的行动前提和效果，以及对象类型的符号描述。",
