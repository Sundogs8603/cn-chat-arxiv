    "translated_abstract": "现有的大多数低秩矩阵补全算法的可证保证都依赖于一些不切实际的假设，例如矩阵条目是随机采样的，或者采样模式具有特定的结构。在本文中，我们建立了理论保证，适用于任何确定性取样方案的精确和近似低秩矩阵补全问题。为此，我们引入一个图形，其中观察到的条目作为其边界，并研究了它的图形属性，包括标准约束核范数最小化算法的性能。我们从理论和实验上证明，当观察图形连接良好并且具有类似的节点度时，该算法可以成功运行。我们的结果可以看作是 Bhojanapalli 和 Jain [2014] 以及 Burnwal 和 Vidyasagar [2020] 的工作的扩展，在其中观察图的节点度被假定为相同。特别地，我们的理论显著改进了这些工作的结果。",
