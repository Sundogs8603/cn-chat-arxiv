    "translated_abstract": "面向方面情感分析是情感挖掘领域长期以来的研究兴趣，近年来，研究人员逐渐将焦点从简单的ABSA子任务转向端到端的多要素ABSA任务。然而，目前研究中使用的数据集局限于特定任务的个别要素，通常关注于领域内设置，忽略了隐含的方面和观点，并且数据规模较小。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个大规模的多要素多领域数据集(MEMD)，涵盖了五个领域的四个要素，包括近2万个评论句子和3万个带有显式和隐式方面和观点的四元组，可用于ABSA研究。同时，我们在开放领域设置下评估了生成式和非生成式基线模型在多个ABSA子任务上的表现，结果表明，开放领域ABSA以及挖掘隐含的方面和观点仍然是待解决的挑战。",
