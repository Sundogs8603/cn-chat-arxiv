Computer vision-based methods have been used extensively in recent years to tackle the problem of parking lot management, but most of the works assume that the parking spots are manually labeled, impacting the cost and feasibility of deployment. To fill this gap, this work presents an automatic parking space detection method, which receives a sequence of images of a parking lot and returns a list of coordinates identifying the detected parking spaces. The proposed method employs instance segmentation to identify cars and, using vehicle occurrence, generate a heat map of parking spaces. The results using twelve different subsets from the PKLot and CNRPark-EXT parking lot datasets show that the method achieved an AP25 score up to 95.60\\% and AP50 score up to 79.90\\%.",

    "translated_abstract": "智能停车解决方案利用传感器、相机和数据分析提高停车效率、减少交通拥堵。计算机视觉方法近年来广泛用于停车场管理问题的解决，但大多数作品假定停车位是手动标注的，影响部署的成本和可行性。为了填补这一空白，本研究提出了一种自动检测停车位的方法，该方法接收一个停车场图像序列，并返回一个标识检测到的停车位的坐标列表。所提出的方法采用实例分割来识别汽车，并使用车辆出现来生成停车位的热力图。来自PKLot和CNRPark-EXT停车场数据集的12个不同子集的结果表明，该方法实现了最高95.60％的AP25分数和最高79.90％的AP50分数。",
