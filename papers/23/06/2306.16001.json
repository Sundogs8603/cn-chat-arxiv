This study introduces a framework aimed at curating extensive dictionaries of medical colloquialisms and Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concepts. The framework comprises three modules: a BERT-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that identifies medical entities from social media content, a deep-learning powered normalization module that standardizes the extracted entities, and a semi-supervised clustering module that assigns the most probable UMLS concept to each standardized entity. We applied this framework to COVID-19-related tweets from February 1, 2020, to April 30, 2022, generating a symptom dictionary (available at https://github.com/ningkko/UMLS_colloquialism/) composed of 9,249 standardized entities mapped to 876 UMLS concepts and 38,175 colloquial expressions.

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体在流行病监测中的利用已经得到了很好的证实。然而，当使用预定义的词汇表来检索相关语料库时，常常会引入偏见。本研究介绍了一个框架，旨在构建医学俗语和统一医学语言系统（UMLS）概念的广泛字典。该框架由三个模块组成：基于BERT的命名实体识别（NER）模型，用于从社交媒体内容中识别出医学实体；深度学习驱动的标准化模块，用于对提取出的实体进行规范化处理；半监督聚类模块，将最可能的UMLS概念分配给每个规范化实体。我们将该框架应用于从2020年2月1日到2022年4月30日期间与COVID-19相关的推文，生成了一个症状词典（可在https://github.com/ningkko/UMLS_colloquialism/上获取），其中包含9,249个标准化实体，映射到876个UMLS概念和38,175个俚语表达。该框架的演示",
