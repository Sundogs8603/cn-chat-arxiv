    "translated_abstract": "研究人员已经使用机器学习方法在VR体验中识别晕动。这些方法需要一个精确标记、现实世界和多样化的数据集，以实现高精度和普适性。为了解决这一需求，我们介绍了“VR.net”，这是一个数据集，提供了来自10种不同风格的10种现实世界游戏中约12个小时的游戏玩法视频。对于每个视频帧，精准地分配了一组与晕动相关的标签，如相机/物体运动、深度场和运动流。构建这样一个数据集是具有挑战性的，因为手动标记需要不可行的时间。相反，我们利用一个工具从3D引擎的渲染管道中自动精确地提取地面真实数据，而无需访问VR游戏的源代码。我们通过几个应用程序展示了VR.net的实用性，如风险因素检测和晕动水平预测。我们不断扩展VR.net，并希望其下一个版本提供更多的数据。",
