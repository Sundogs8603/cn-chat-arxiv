    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop machine learning techniques to identify unknown printers in early modern (c.~1500--1800) English printed books. Specifically, we focus on matching uniquely damaged character type-imprints in anonymously printed books to works with known printers in order to provide evidence of their origins. Until now, this work has been limited to manual investigations by analytical bibliographers. We present a Contrastive Attention-based Metric Learning approach to identify similar damage across character image pairs, which is sensitive to very subtle differences in glyph shapes, yet robust to various confounding sources of noise associated with digitized historical books. To overcome the scarce amount of supervised data, we design a random data synthesis procedure that aims to simulate bends, fractures, and inking variations induced by the early printing process. Our method successfully improves downstream damaged type-imprint matching among printed works from this period, ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文利用机器学习技术识别早期（大约1500-1800年）英国印刷书籍中的未知印刷商。特别地，我们专注于匹配匿名印刷书籍中的唯一损坏字符类型印记与已知印刷商作品，以提供其来源的证据。我们提出了一种基于对比注意力度量学习的方法，以识别同一字符图像对中的相似损伤，对字形的微小差异敏感，但对与数字化历史书籍相关的各种混淆噪声具有鲁棒性。为了克服受监督数据匮乏的问题，我们设计了一种随机数据合成过程，旨在模拟早期印刷过程引起的弯曲、断裂和油墨变化。我们的方法成功提高了该时期印刷品中的损坏类型印记匹配结果。",
