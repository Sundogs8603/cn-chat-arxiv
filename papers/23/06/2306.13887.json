    "translated_abstract": "协同过滤（CF）已成为推荐系统最重要的实现策略之一。关键思想是利用个人使用模式生成个性化推荐。尤其是对于新推出的平台，CF技术常常面临数据稀疏性的问题，这极大地限制了它们的性能。在解决数据稀疏性问题方面，文献中提出了几种方法，其中跨领域协同过滤（CDCF）在最近受到了广泛的关注。为了补偿目标领域中可用反馈的不足，CDCF方法利用其他辅助领域中的信息。大多数传统的CDCF方法的目标是在领域之间找到一组共同的实体（用户或项目），然后将它们用作知识转移的桥梁。但是，大多数真实世界的数据集是从不同的领域收集的，这使得跨领域协同过滤更加具有挑战性。",
