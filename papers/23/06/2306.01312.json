    "abstract": "Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has been a popular topic in natural language processing nowadays, at both sentence and aspect level. However, the existing approaches almost require large-size labeled datasets, which bring about large consumption of time and resources. Therefore, it is practical to explore the method for few-shot sentiment analysis in cross-modalities. Previous works generally execute on textual modality, using the prompt-based methods, mainly two types: hand-crafted prompts and learnable prompts. The existing approach in few-shot multi-modality sentiment analysis task has utilized both methods, separately. We further design a hybrid pattern that can combine one or more fixed hand-crafted prompts and learnable prompts and utilize the attention mechanisms to optimize the prompt encoder. The experiments on both sentence-level and aspect-level datasets prove that we get a significant outperformance.",

    "translated_abstract": "多模态情感分析在自然语言处理中是当前一个热门话题，主要针对句子和方面级别。然而，现有方法几乎都需要大规模的标记数据集，这会带来大量的时间和资源消耗。因此，研究跨模态的少样本情感分析方法是很实用的。先前的研究主要执行在文本模式，使用基于提示的方法，主要有两种类型：手工提示和可学习提示。在小样本多模态情感分析任务中，现有方法已分别使用了这两种方法。我们进一步设计了一种混合模式，可以结合一个或多个固定的手工提示和可学习提示，并利用注意机制来优化提示编码器。在句子级和方面级数据集上的实验表明，我们得到了显着的性能提升。",
