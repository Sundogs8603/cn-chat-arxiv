    "abstract": "We consider the problem of subset selection where one is given multiple rankings of items and the goal is to select the highest ``quality'' subset. Score functions from the multiwinner voting literature have been used to aggregate rankings into quality scores for subsets. We study this setting of subset selection problems when, in addition, rankings may contain systemic or unconscious biases toward a group of items. For a general model of input rankings and biases, we show that requiring the selected subset to satisfy group fairness constraints can improve the quality of the selection with respect to unbiased rankings. Importantly, we show that for fairness constraints to be effective, different multiwinner score functions may require a drastically different number of rankings: While for some functions, fairness constraints need an exponential number of rankings to recover a close-to-optimal solution, for others, this dependency is only polynomial.

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了子集选择问题，其中给定多个项目的排名，目标是选择最高“质量”的子集。来自多赢家投票文献的评分函数已用于将排名聚合为子集的质量得分。我们研究了在此设置下的子集选择问题，当排名可能包含对一组项目的系统性或无意识的偏见时，我们的目标是在兼顾公平的前提下，提高选择质量。对于输入排名和偏见的一般模型，我们表明要求所选的子集满足群体公平性约束，可以提高选择在没有偏见的排名中的质量。重要的是，我们表明，对于公平性限制要有效，不同的多赢家评分函数可能需要极其不同数量的排名：对于一些函数，公平性限制需要指数级数量的排名才能恢复接近最优解，而对于其他函数，这种依赖性仅为多项式。这个结果依赖于一个新颖的概念。",
