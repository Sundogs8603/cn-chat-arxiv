In this paper, we propose UI-Diffuser, an approach that leverages Stable Diffusion to generate mobile UIs through simple textual descriptions and UI components. Preliminary results show that UI-Diffuser provides an efficient and cost-effective way to generate mobile GUI designs while reducing the need for extensive prototyping efforts.

    "translated_abstract": "GUI（图形用户界面）原型设计是需求工程中广泛使用的技术，用于收集和完善需求，降低开发风险并增加干系人的参与度。然而，GUI原型设计可能是一项耗时且昂贵的过程。近年来，诸如Stable Diffusion等深度学习模型已成为一种强大的文本到图像工具，并能够根据文本提示生成详细的图像。在本文中，我们提出了UI-Diffuser，一种利用Stable Diffusion生成移动UI的方法，通过简单的文本描述和UI组件。初步结果表明，UI-Diffuser提供了一种高效且具有成本效益的方法，可以减少对广泛原型设计工作的需求，从而生成移动GUI设计。这种方法有望显著提高GUI原型设计在需求工程中的速度和效率。",
