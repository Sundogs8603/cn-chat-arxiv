    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了具有利率风险和多个不确定风险来源的动态资产配置。市场包括无风险资产、零息债券（均由Vasicek模型确定）和股票。对于风险溢价、波动性和相关性存在不确定性。投资者的偏好既体现了风险规避，也体现了不确定性规避。在典型的市场条件下，可以通过闭合形式来解决最优投资问题。解决方案表明，投资者不对不确定性进行对冲，只对冒险性投资进行对冲，而不确定性只影响投资者的投机动机。最优投资策略的实施显示了不同不确定性来源的影响。不确定性规避有助于抑制忽略不确定性的高杠杆投资组合，并导致更符合流行投资建议的策略。最优投资问题的解决方法基于马丁格尔优化的扩展。",
