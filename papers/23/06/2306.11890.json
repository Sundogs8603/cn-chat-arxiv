    "abstract": "Real-world deployment of computer vision systems, including in the discovery processes of biomedical research, requires causal representations that are invariant to contextual nuisances and generalize to new data. Leveraging the internal replicate structure of two novel single-cell fluorescent microscopy datasets, we propose generally applicable tests to assess the extent to which models learn causal representations across increasingly challenging levels of OOD-generalization. We show that despite seemingly strong performance, as assessed by other established metrics, both naive and contemporary baselines designed to ward against confounding, collapse on these tests. We introduce a new method, Interventional Style Transfer (IST), that substantially improves OOD generalization by generating interventional training distributions in which spurious correlations between biological causes and nuisances are mitigated. We publish our code and datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "计算机视觉技术的真实世界应用，包括生物医学研究中的发现过程，需要对上下文干扰具有不变性和对新数据具有泛化性的因果表征。利用两个新的单细胞荧光显微镜数据集的内在复制结构，我们提出了一般适用的测试方法，以评估模型在越来越具挑战性的OOD泛化水平上学习因果表征的程度。我们发现，尽管根据其他已建立的度量衡量，既有的天真基线设计用于防止混淆，但这些基线在这些测试中都会失效。我们引入了一种新的方法，干预风格转移（IST），通过生成干预训练分布，在其中减轻生物原因和干扰因素之间的虚假相关性，从而显着改善了OOD泛化性能。我们发布了我们的代码和数据集。",
