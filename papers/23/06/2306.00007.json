    "translated_abstract": "巴西司法机关工作量大，导致司法程序时间长。巴西国家司法委员会在469/2022号决议中制定了数字化文件和流程的正式指导方针，开拓了在法律领域中使用自动技术以帮助日常任务的可能性，尤其是在大量文本的情况下。人工智能技术允许从文本数据中处理和提取有用信息，潜在地加快该过程。然而，多个人工智能技术所需的法律领域数据集很少且难以获得，因为它们需要专家的标签。为了解决这一挑战，本文为法律领域贡献了四个数据集，其中两个具有文档和元数据但未标记，另外两个则标记了启发式标签，旨在用于文本语义相似性任务。此外，为了评估使用弱监督创建语义文本相似性标记数据集的有效性，我们将其与传统的注释过程进行了比较。结果表明，弱监督可以是一个可行的选择，达到了与传统方法相当的性能。",
