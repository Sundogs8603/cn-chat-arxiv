    "translated_abstract": "知识库问答(KBQA)近年来引起了广泛关注，特别是针对需要多个事实才能回答的复杂问题。问题分解是回答复杂问题的一种有前途的方法。现有的分解方法将问题分解为子问题，但仅按单一的组合性类型分解不足以解决涉及多种组合性类型的问题。在本文中，我们提出了问题分解树(QDT)来表示复杂问题的结构。受自然语言生成(NLG)近期进展的启发，我们提出了一种称为Clue-Decipher的两阶段方法来生成QDT。它可以利用NLG模型的强大能力，同时保留原始问题。为了验证QDT能够提高KBQA任务的性能，我们设计了一个基于分解的KBQA系统QDTQA。大量实验表明，QDTQA在ComplexWebQuestions数据集上的性能优于之前最先进的方法。",
