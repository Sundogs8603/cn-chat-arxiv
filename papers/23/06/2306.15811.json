    "translated_title": "学习同源脑结构的正常不对称表示",
    "translated_abstract": "尽管正常的同源脑结构在定义上是近似对称的，但它们也会因自然老化等原因而存在形状差异。另一方面，神经退行性疾病会导致不对称程度增加或改变其位置。目前，确定这些变化是否由病理性恶化引起仍然具有挑战性。目前的临床工具要么依赖于主观评估、基本体积测量，要么依赖于特定疾病的深度学习模型。本文介绍了一种基于异常检测和表示学习的方法，用于学习同源脑结构中正常的不对称模式。我们的框架使用Siamese架构，将脑结构左右半球的3D分割映射到一个基于支持向量数据描述目标学习的正常不对称嵌入空间。由于只使用健康样本进行训练，它可以量化与正常不对称性偏离的程度。",
