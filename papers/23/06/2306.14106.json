    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习技术已成熟应用于物体检测领域，大多数算法趋向于监督学习。然而，大量标记数据需要高昂的人力成本，导致低效率和限制。半监督物体检测 (SSOD) 因其高研究价值和实用性而越来越受到关注。它旨在通过使用少量标记数据和大量未标记数据学习信息。本文从五个方面全面而最新地介绍了 SSOD 方法。我们首先简要介绍了几种数据增强的方法。然后，我们将主流的半监督策略分为伪标签，一致性正则化，基于图形和基于迁移学习的方法，并介绍了一些在有挑战的情况下的方法。我们进一步介绍了广泛使用的损失函数，然后概述了常见的基准数据集和评估指标。最后，我们回顾了最近在 SSOD 上的进展并讨论了未来的潜在方向。",
