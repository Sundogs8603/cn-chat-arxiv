    "abstract": "Game level blending via machine learning, the process of combining features of game levels to create unique and novel game levels using Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) techniques, has gained increasing popularity in recent years. However, many existing techniques rely on human-annotated level representations, which limits game level blending to a limited number of annotated games. Even with annotated games, researchers often need to author an additional shared representation to make blending possible. In this paper, we present a novel approach to game level blending that employs Clustering-based Tile Embeddings (CTE), a learned level representation technique that can serve as a level representation for unannotated games and a unified level representation across games without the need for human annotation. CTE represents game level tiles as a continuous vector representation, unifying their visual, contextual, and behavioral information. We apply this approach",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，通过机器学习进行游戏关卡混合的方法在游戏产生技术领域逐渐流行起来。然而，许多现有的技术依赖于人工注释的关卡表示，从而限制了游戏关卡混合的数量。即使有人工注释的游戏，研究人员还需要创建一个额外的共享表示才能进行混合。本文提出了一种新颖的游戏关卡混合方法，使用了基于聚类的平铺嵌入（CTE），这是一种学习的关卡表示技术，可以为非注释游戏提供关卡表示，并在游戏之间提供统一的关卡表示，而无需人工注释。",
