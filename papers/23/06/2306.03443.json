    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the world's leading neurodegenerative disease, which often results in communication difficulties. Analysing speech can serve as a diagnostic tool for identifying the condition. The recent ADReSS challenge provided a dataset for AD classification and highlighted the utility of manual transcriptions. In this study, we used the new state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model Whisper to obtain the transcriptions, which also include automatic punctuation. The classification models achieved test accuracy scores of 0.854 and 0.833 combining the pretrained FastText word embeddings and recurrent neural networks on manual and ASR transcripts respectively. Additionally, we explored the influence of including pause information and punctuation in the transcriptions. We found that punctuation only yielded minor improvements in some cases, whereas pause encoding aided AD classification for both manual and ASR transcriptions across all approaches investigated.",

    "translated_abstract": "阿尔茨海默病(AD)是世界上最常见的神经退行性疾病之一，常常伴随着交流困难。分析语音可以作为诊断工具来识别该病。最近的ADReSS挑战提供了一个用于AD分类的数据集，并突出了手动转录的实用性。在本研究中，我们使用了最新的自动语音识别（ASR）模型Whisper来获取转录，其中还包括自动标点符号。分类模型结合预训练的FastText字嵌入和循环神经网络在手动和ASR转录中分别实现了0.854和0.833的测试准确度得分。此外，我们探讨了在转录中包含停顿信息和标点符号的影响。我们发现，在一些情况下，标点符号只能产生轻微的改进，而停顿编码可以帮助手动和ASR转录在所有探究的方法中进行AD分类。",
