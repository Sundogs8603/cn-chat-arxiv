    "translated_abstract": "状态空间模型（SSM）在需要建模长期依赖性并且需要高效扩展到长序列的任务中显示出了惊人的效果。尽管最初是为连续信号设计的，但SSM在视觉和音频等许多任务中表现出了优异的性能；然而，在语言建模任务中，SSM仍然落后于Transformers的性能。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个名为块状态变换器（BST）的混合层，它在内部组合了一个用于长距离上下文化的SSM子层和一个用于短期序列表示的块变换器子层。我们研究了三种不同的、完全可并行的集成SSM和块注意力的变体。我们证明了我们的模型在语言建模的困惑度上优于类似的基于Transformer的架构，并且可以推广到更长的序列。此外，块状态变换器在层级别上具有超过十倍的速度提升。",
