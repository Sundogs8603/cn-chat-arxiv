    "translated_title": "短视频推荐中基于树的渐进回归模型用于观看时间预测",
    "translated_abstract": "观看时间的精确预测在视频推荐系统中提高用户参与度至关重要。为了实现这一点，观看时间预测框架应该满足四个属性：首先，尽管其具有连续值，但观看时间也是一种有序变量，其值之间的相对顺序反映了用户喜好的差异。因此，有序关系应该反映在观看时间预测中。其次，应该捕捉视频观看行为之间的条件依赖性。例如，观看视频的一半后，才能完成整个视频的观看。第三，在模型中使用点估计来建模观看时间忽略了模型可能会给出高度不确定性的结果的事实，这可能会导致推荐系统出现错误。因此，该框架应该意识到预测不确定性。第四，现实生活中的推荐系统存在严重的偏差放大问题，因此准确、健壮的框架应该解决这个问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于树的渐进回归模型(TPRM)，它满足所有这些要求。该模型使用基于树的结构来预测观看时间，反映了不同观看时间值之间的有序关系。此外，TPRM还集成了不同视频观看行为之间的条件依赖性，并将预测不确定性纳入框架中。实验结果表明，TPRM在预测精度和健壮性方面明显优于几种最先进的方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a tree-based progressive regression model that takes into account the ordinal relations between different values of watch time, the conditional dependencies between different video-watching behaviors, prediction uncertainty, and the bias amplification issue in real-life recommender systems, achieving superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods."
