    "translated_abstract": "由于其较大的参数空间，训练多模态网络需要大量的数据。主动学习是一种广泛使用的技术，通过选择只对改善模型性能有贡献的样本，来减少数据注释成本。然而，当前的主动学习策略主要针对单模态任务设计，当应用于多模态数据时，往往会导致从主导模态中选择样本的偏见。这种不公平阻碍了平衡的多模态学习，这对于实现最佳性能至关重要。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了三个设计更平衡的多模态主动学习策略的准则。在遵循这些准则的基础上，我们提出了一种新的方法，通过在模态之间调节梯度嵌入和主导程度，实现更公平的数据选择。我们的研究表明，所提出的方法通过避免贪婪地选择样本，实现了更平衡的多模态学习。",
