    "translated_abstract": "词误率（WER）和字符误率（CER）是语音识别（ASR）中的标准指标，但是其中的一个问题始终是替代拼写：如果一个系统将adviser转录为advisor，那么即使这两个拼写实际上代表相同的单词，它也会被计为错误。日语以“缺乏拼写规范”而闻名：大多数单词可以用多种方式拼写，这对准确的ASR评估构成了问题。在这篇论文中，我们提出了一种新的宽松评估度量作为更可靠的日语ASR CER度量标准。我们使用词汇资源、日语文本处理系统和神经机器翻译模型创建参考转录的可能重拼构成的图，用于将假名或片假名重建成汉字。在手动评估中，评估人员将95.4%的拼写变体评为可信。ASR结果表明，我们的方法不会惩罚系统选择有效但非标准的拼写，从而实现了对日语语音识别的更真实的评估。",
