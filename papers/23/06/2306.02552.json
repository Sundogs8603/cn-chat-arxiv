    "translated_abstract": "用户行为分析在以人为中心的AI应用中至关重要。然而，收集足够和高质量的用户行为数据一直是一个基本但具有挑战性的问题。为了解决这个问题，自动模拟用户行为是一个直观的想法。然而，由于人类认知过程的主观和复杂性质，可靠地模拟用户行为是困难的。最近，大语言模型（LLM）取得了显著的成功，展示了实现类似人类智能的巨大潜力。我们认为这些模型为可靠的用户模拟提供了重要机会，并有可能改变传统的用户行为分析研究范式。在本文中，我们以推荐系统为例，探索使用LLM进行用户模拟的潜力。具体而言，我们将每个用户视为基于LLM的自治智能体，并让不同智能体在虚拟环境中自由交流、行为和发展。",
