    "abstract": "The availability of historical data related to electricity day-ahead prices and to the underlying price formation process is limited. In addition, the electricity market in Europe is facing a rapid transformation, which limits the representativeness of older observations for predictive purposes. On the other hand, machine learning methods that gained traction also in the domain of electricity price forecasting typically require large amounts of data. This study analyses the effectiveness of encoding well-established domain knowledge to mitigate the need for large training datasets. The domain knowledge is incorporated by imposing a structure on the price forecasting problem; the resulting accuracy gains are quantified in an experiment. Compared to an \"unstructured\" purely statistical model, it is shown that introducing intermediate quantity forecasts of load, renewable infeed, and cross-border exchange, paired with the estimation of supply curves, can result in a NRMSE reduction by 0.1",

    "translated_abstract": "与电力日前价格和基本价格形成过程相关的历史数据的可用性是有限的。此外，欧洲电力市场正在面临快速转型，这限制了用于预测目的的旧观察结果的代表性。本研究分析了将行业内已经建立的领域知识编码的有效性，以减少大量训练数据集的需求。通过在价格预测问题上施加结构来纳入领域知识，实验量化了由此带来的精度提高。与“非结构化”的纯统计模型相比，引入负荷、可再生能源注入和跨界交流的中间数量预测以及供给曲线的估计可以使NRMSE降低0.1。",
