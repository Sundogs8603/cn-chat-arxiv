    "abstract": "In this work, we developed a novel text-guided image synthesis technique which could generate realistic tau PET images from textual descriptions and the subject's MR image. The generated tau PET images have the potential to be used in examining relations between different measures and also increasing the public availability of tau PET datasets. The method was based on latent diffusion models. Both textual descriptions and the subject's MR prior image were utilized as conditions during image generation. The subject's MR image can provide anatomical details, while the text descriptions, such as gender, scan time, cognitive test scores, and amyloid status, can provide further guidance regarding where the tau neurofibrillary tangles might be deposited. Preliminary experimental results based on clinical [18F]MK-6240 datasets demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method in generating realistic tau PET images at different clinical stages.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的文本引导图像合成技术，可以根据文本描述和被试的MR图像生成逼真的Tau PET图像。生成的Tau PET图像有助于研究不同测量之间的关系，并增加Tau PET数据集的公共可用性。该方法基于潜在扩散模型，使用文本描述和被试的MR图像为条件进行图像生成。被试的MR图像可以提供解剖细节，而文本描述（如性别、扫描时间、认知测试分数和淀粉样蛋白状态）则可提供有关Tau神经纤维缠结可能沉积的位置的进一步指导。基于临床[18F]MK-6240数据集的初步实验结果表明，所提出的方法在生成不同临床阶段的逼真Tau PET图像方面具有可行性。",
