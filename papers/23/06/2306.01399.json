    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱中的复杂逻辑查询指的是以逻辑形式表达的查询，传达复杂的含义，比如加拿大的图灵奖得主毕业于哪里？基于知识图谱推理的应用程序，例如对话系统和交互式搜索引擎，依赖于回答复杂逻辑查询作为基本任务的能力。在大多数知识图谱中，边缘通常用于描述实体之间的关系或它们的关联属性值。属性值可以是分类或数值格式，例如日期、年份、尺寸等。然而，现有的复杂查询答案（CQA）方法仅将数值与实体视为相同。这可能会导致回答某些查询的困难，例如哪个澳大利亚的普利策奖得主出生于1927年之前，哪种药物是一种止痛剂，并且副作用比布洛芬更少。本文受到数值编码最近的进展的启发，提出了一种将数值推理纳入知识图谱推理的新方法。我们的方法将数值视为一等公民，并提供了一个统一的框架，用于对实体和数值进行推理。我们在两个基准数据集WIKWD和WebQSP上进行了广泛的实验，证明了我们所提出的方法在回答涉及数值的复杂查询方面的有效性和效率。",
