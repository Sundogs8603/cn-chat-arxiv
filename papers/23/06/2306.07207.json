    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)以其卓越的会话能力，在各种应用中表现出色，并成为强大的AI助手。鉴于此，一个直观的问题是：我们能否利用LLMs的能力构建多模态的视觉应用AI助手？最近，已经开发了几个多模态模型来实现这个目的。它们通常预先训练一个适应模块来对齐视觉编码器和语言模型的语义，然后在指令跟随数据上进行微调。然而，尽管这个流程在图像和语言理解方面取得了成功，在视频和语言理解方面的有效性还没有得到广泛探索。在本文中，我们旨在开发一个能够在一个通用框架内理解视频、图像和语言的新型多模态基础模型。为了实现这一目标，我们引入了Valley，一个以大型语言模型增强的视频助手。",
