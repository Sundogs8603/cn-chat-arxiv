    "translated_abstract": "通过使用基于对抗生成网络（GAN）进行数据增强是扩展训练AI模型的可用数据集的一种方法。GAN通过使用生成器网络创建新的数据样本，并由鉴别器网络评估其与真实样本的相似性来工作。鉴别器网络被教导去区分真实和合成样本，生成器系统则被训练生成与真实数据相似的数据。这个过程一直重复，直到生成器网络能够生成与真实数据无法区分的合成数据。GAN已经在医学图像分析中用于各种任务，包括数据增强、图像创建和领域适应。它们可以生成用于增加可用数据集的合成样本，尤其是在获取大量真实数据困难或不道德的情况下。但是，使用GAN进行数据增强需要谨慎，因为生成的数据可能无法完全代表现实世界数据的复杂性和多样性。",
