    "translated_abstract": "混沌系统使得长时间预测变得困难，因为初始条件的微小扰动会导致轨迹以指数速度发散。在这种情况下，神经算子训练为最小化平方误差损失，虽然能够准确地进行短期预测，但常常无法再长时间内复制动力学的统计或结构特性，并且可能产生退化的结果。本文提出了一种替代框架，旨在保持表征动态不变统计属性的混沌吸引子的不变测度。具体来说，在多环境设置中（每个样本轨迹都受略微不同动态的控制），我们考虑了两种新的处理嘈杂数据的方法。首先，我们提出了一种基于观测到的动态与神经算子输出之间的最优传输距离的损失。这种方法需要专家对基础物理的专业知识来确定最优传输距离矩阵。",
