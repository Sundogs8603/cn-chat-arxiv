    "translated_abstract": "多实例学习是一种理想的组织病理学数据分析模式，其中大量的全切片图像通常用单个全局标签进行注释。在这种情况下，整个切片图像被建模为一组要进行聚合和分类的组织斑块。用于进行此分类的常见模型包括循环神经网络和transformer。尽管使用了强大的压缩算法，如深度预训练神经网络，来降低每个斑块的维度，但来自整个切片图像的序列仍然过长，通常包含数万个斑块。结构化状态空间模型是一种新兴的序列建模替代方案，专门设计用于高效建模长序列。这些模型通过将输入序列最优投影到压缩整个序列的内存单元中来实现。在本文中，我们提出将状态空间模型用作多实例学习器，以实现可变性的分析。",
