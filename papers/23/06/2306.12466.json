    "abstract": "Social media feed algorithms are designed to optimize online social engagements for the purpose of maximizing advertising profits, and therefore have an incentive to promote controversial posts including misinformation. By thinking about misinformation as information pollution, we can draw parallels with environmental policy for countering pollution such as carbon taxes. Similar to pollution, a Pigouvian tax on misinformation provides economic incentives for social media companies to control the spread of misinformation more effectively to avoid or reduce their misinformation tax, while preserving some degree of freedom in platforms' response. In this paper, we highlight a bird's eye view of a Pigouvian misinformation tax and discuss the key questions and next steps for implementing such a taxing scheme.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体反馈算法被设计用于优化在线社交互动以最大化广告收益，因此有推广包括错误信息在内的有争议帖子的倾向。通过将错误信息视为信息污染，我们可以将其与反击污染如碳税等环境政策进行类比。类似于污染，对错误信息的Pigouv税提供了经济激励，以使社交媒体公司更有效地控制错误信息的传播，以避免或减少其错误信息税，同时保留平台响应某些程度的自由。在本文中，我们着眼于Pigouv税的鸟瞰视角，并讨论实施此种课税方案的关键问题和下一步行动。",
