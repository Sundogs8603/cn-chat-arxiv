    "translated_abstract": "图上的节点分类是一项重要的任务，具有广泛的应用，包括社交分析和异常检测。虽然图神经网络（GNN）在这项任务上已经取得了一些有希望的结果，但目前的技术通常假设节点的标签信息是准确的，这在现实应用中可能并不成立。为了解决这个问题，我们研究了如何在标签噪声下的图上学习，并开发了一种名为一致性图神经网络（CGNN）的新方法来解决它。具体而言，我们采用了图对比学习作为正则化项，促进增强节点的两个视角具有一致的表示。由于这个正则化项不能利用标签信息，它可以增强节点表示对标签噪声的鲁棒性。此外，为了在图上检测噪声标签，我们提出了一种基于同质性假设的样本选择技术，通过测量嵌入和它们的邻居之间的一致性来识别噪声节点。各种真实世界数据集上的实验结果表明，CGNN可以有效地缓解标签噪声对节点分类的负面影响，并在对称和非对称标签噪声模型下优于最先进的基线。",
