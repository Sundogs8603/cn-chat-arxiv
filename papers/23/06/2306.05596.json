    "translated_abstract": "低自尊和人际需求（即受挫的归属感和感知的负担）对抑郁和自杀企图产生重大影响。个体在社交媒体上寻求社交连结以增强和缓解他们的孤独感。社交媒体平台使人们能够表达他们的想法、经验、信仰和情感。社交媒体上的心理健康研究集中在症状、原因和障碍上。而初步的社交媒体内容筛选出人际风险因素和低自尊心可能会引发心理障碍者的早期警报，并指派治疗师对其进行干预。标准化量表使用心理学理论制定的问题来衡量自尊心和人际需求。在目前的研究中，我们介绍了一个基于心理学和专家注释的数据集LoST：低自尊心，用于研究和检测Reddit上的低自尊心。通过一种注释方法，该注释包括对注释的一致性、正确性和相关性的检查，我们确保了数据集的高质量。我们的数据集包括10,000个Reddit帖子，这些帖子标注了低自尊心、受挫的归属感和感知的负担。数据集由心理学专家进行注释，他们遵循了成熟的心理学理论，用于低自尊心识别和人际需求评估。我们介绍了数据集的统计信息，并评估低自尊心检测的基线方法。我们的结果强调了需要针对低自尊心的数据集，以更准确地识别可能需要干预的个体。",
