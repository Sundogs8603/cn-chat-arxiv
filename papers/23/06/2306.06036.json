    "translated_abstract": "在人工智能不断发展的今天，多模态和神经符号学范式处于前沿地位，特别强调在不同模态下识别和交互实体及其关系。为了解决这个背景下复杂查询和交互的需求，我们介绍了SNeL（结构化神经符号语言），这是一种多功能查询语言，旨在促进神经网络处理多模态数据的微妙交互。SNeL的表达接口可以构建复杂查询，支持逻辑和算术运算符、比较器、嵌套等。这允许用户定位特定实体、指定其属性并限制结果，从而有效地从场景中提取信息。通过将高级符号推理与低级神经处理对齐，SNeL有效地弥合了神经符号学分歧。该语言的多功能性扩展到多种数据类型，包括图像、文本和语音，使其成为基于实体的多模态场景理解的有价值的工具。",
