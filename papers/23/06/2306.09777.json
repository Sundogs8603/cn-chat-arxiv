    "abstract": "Search engines are widely used for finding information on the internet. However, there are limitations in the current search approach, such as providing popular but not necessarily relevant results. This research addresses the issue of polysemy in search results by implementing a search function that determines the sentimentality of the retrieved information. The study utilizes a web crawler to collect data from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) news site, and the sentimentality of the news articles is determined using the Sentistrength program. The results demonstrate that the proposed search function improves recall value while accurately retrieving nonpolysemous news. Furthermore, Sentistrength outperforms deep learning and clustering methods in classifying search results. The methodology presented in this article can be applied to analyze the sentimentality and reputation of entities on the internet.",

    "translated_abstract": "搜索引擎是人们在互联网上寻找信息的常用工具。然而，当前的搜索方法存在一些局限性，例如提供流行但不一定相关的结果。本研究通过实现一个确定检索信息情感色彩的搜索功能来解决搜索结果中的多义问题。该研究利用网络爬虫从英国广播公司（BBC）新闻网站收集数据，使用Sentistrength程序确定新闻文章的情感性。结果表明，所提出的搜索功能在提高召回率的同时，准确地检索到了非多义新闻。此外，Sentistrength在分类搜索结果方面的表现优于深度学习和聚类方法。本文介绍的方法可以应用于分析互联网上实体的情感和声誉。",
