    "translated_abstract": "情感分析是一项众所周知的自然语言处理任务，涉及识别给定文本的情感色彩或极性。随着社交媒体和其他在线平台的增长，情感分析对于寻求监控和理解客户反馈和意见的企业和组织变得越来越重要。监督学习算法已经广泛用于这个任务，但它们需要人工标注的文本来创建分类器。为了克服这个挑战，使用了基于词典的工具。基于词典的算法的一个缺点是它们依赖于预定义的情感词典，这可能无法捕捉自然语言中的所有情感范围。ChatGPT是OpenAI的新产品，已成为最受欢迎的人工智能产品之一。它可以回答各种主题和任务的问题。本研究探讨了使用ChatGPT作为不同情感分析任务的数据标注工具。在两个实验数据集上进行了评估。",
