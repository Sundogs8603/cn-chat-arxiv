    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的有监督降维技术，称为监督线性中心编码（SLCE），它是非线性中心编码（CE）\\citep{ghosh2022supervised}的线性对应物。SLCE通过使用线性变换将类别的样本映射到其类别中心点来工作。该变换是一个投影，它重构一个点，使其与相应类别中心点的距离（即中心点重构损失）在环境空间中最小化。我们使用对称矩阵的特征分解导出了一个闭合形式解。我们对所提出方法的一些关键数学性质进行了详细分析和展示。%我们还提供了一种基于下降方法求解优化问题的迭代解决方案。我们建立了特征值与中心点重构损失之间的联系。与在环境空间中重构样本的主成分分析（PCA）相比，该变换可以在低维度空间中重构样本。",
