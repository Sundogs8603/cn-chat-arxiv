    "abstract": "Automating dysarthria assessments offers the opportunity to develop effective, low-cost tools that address the current limitations of manual and subjective assessments. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether current approaches rely on dysarthria-related speech patterns or external factors. We aim toward obtaining a clearer understanding of dysarthria patterns. To this extent, we study the effects of noise in recordings, both through addition and reduction. We design and implement a new method for visualizing and comparing feature extractors and models, at a patient level, in a more interpretable way. We use the UA-Speech dataset with a speaker-based split of the dataset. Results reported in the literature appear to have been done irrespective of such split, leading to models that may be overconfident due to data-leakage. We hope that these results raise awareness in the research community regarding the requirements for establishing reliable automatic dysarthria assessment systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动化发音障碍评估提供了开发有效低成本工具的机会，这些工具可以解决手动和主观评估的现有限制。 然而，目前的方法是否依赖于发音障碍相关的语音模式或外部因素尚不清楚。 我们旨在更清楚地了解发音障碍模式。 为此，我们通过添加和减少噪声，设计和实施了一种新的方法来可视化和比较特征提取器和模型，在患者层面上进行更可解释的方式。我们使用了UA-Speech数据集，将数据以说话人为单位进行拆分。 目前的文献中报告的结果似乎无论是否进行了这种拆分，都会导致由于数据泄漏而可能过于自信的模型。 我们希望这些结果提高研究界对建立可靠的自动发音障碍评估系统的要求的意识。",
