    "abstract": "Data valuation -- quantifying the contribution of individual data sources to certain predictive behaviors of a model -- is of great importance to enhancing the transparency of machine learning and designing incentive systems for data sharing. Existing work has focused on evaluating data sources with the shared feature or sample space. How to valuate fragmented data sources of which each only contains partial features and samples remains an open question. We start by presenting a method to calculate the counterfactual of removing a fragment from the aggregated data matrix. Based on the counterfactual calculation, we further propose 2D-Shapley, a theoretical framework for fragmented data valuation that uniquely satisfies some appealing axioms in the fragmented data context. 2D-Shapley empowers a range of new use cases, such as selecting useful data fragments, providing interpretation for sample-wise data values, and fine-grained data issue diagnosis.",

    "translated_abstract": "数据估值——量化单个数据源对模型某些预测行为的贡献——对于增强机器学习的透明度和设计数据共享的激励系统至关重要。现有工作主要集中在评估具有共享特征或样本空间的数据源。如何估值碎片化数据源，其中每个只包含部分特征和样本，仍然是一个开放的问题。我们首先提出了一种计算从聚合数据矩阵中移除一个碎片的对立现实的方法。基于对立现实的计算，我们进一步提出了2D-Shapley，一个在碎片化数据估值环境中满足一些吸引人的公理的理论框架。 2D-Shapley能够实现一系列新的用例，比如选择有用的数据片段，为样本数据值提供解释，并进行精细化的数据问题诊断。",

It satisfies important axioms in the fragmented data context and enables new use cases such as selecting useful data fragments, interpreting sample-wise data values, and diagnosing data issues at a fine-grained level."
