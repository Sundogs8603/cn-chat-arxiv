    "translated_abstract": "模拟推断方法用于解决具有挑战性的逆问题的复杂科学模型。然而，由于其非可微性质，模拟推断模型常常面临重大困难，这阻碍了梯度优化技术的应用。贝叶斯最优实验设计 (BOED) 是一种强大的方法，旨在最有效地利用实验资源，以改进推断结果。尽管随机梯度 BOED 方法在高维设计问题上取得了有希望的结果，但由于许多模拟推断模型的难以处理的非可微性质，BOED 与模拟推断的整合大多被忽视。在本研究中，我们通过利用互信息界限，建立了基于比率的模拟推断推理算法与基于随机梯度的变分推断之间的重要连接。这种连接使我们能够将BOED扩展到模拟推断应用领域，实现实验设计和摊还推断方法的同时优化。",
