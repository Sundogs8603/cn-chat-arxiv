Data-driven models play a crucial role in digital twins, enabling real-time updates and predictions by leveraging data and computational models. Nonetheless, the fidelity of available data and the scarcity of accurate sensor data often hinder the efficient learning of surrogate models, which serve as the connection between physical systems and digital twin models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that begins by developing a robust multi-fidelity surrogate model, subsequently applied for tracking digital twin systems. Our framework integrates polynomial correlated function expansion (PCFE) with the Gaussian process (GP) to create an effective surrogate model called H-PCFE.",

    "translated_abstract": "数字孪生技术在航空航天、基础设施和汽车等工程和工业领域的重要意义不容忽视。然而，缺乏详细的应用特定信息对其在实际系统中的无缝实施构成了挑战。数据驱动模型在数字孪生中发挥着关键作用，通过利用数据和计算模型实现实时更新和预测。然而，可用数据的保真度和准确传感器数据的缺乏常常阻碍了代理模型的高效学习，而这些模型是物理系统和数字孪生模型之间的连接。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一个新的框架，从开发一个强大的多保真度代理模型开始，随后应用于跟踪数字孪生系统。我们的框架将多项式相关函数扩展（PCFE）与高斯过程（GP）集成起来，创建出一个有效的代理模型称为H-PCFE。",
