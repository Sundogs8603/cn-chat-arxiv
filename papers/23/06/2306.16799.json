    "translated_abstract": "最近人工智能(AI)的发展为建筑、工程和施工(AEC)行业提供了前所未有的自动化机会。然而，尽管人们对使用AI充满热情，但目前85%的大数据项目失败。AEC行业AI项目失败的主要原因之一是规划或决定使用AI的人与实施者之间的脱节。AEC从业者经常缺乏对AI的能力和限制的清晰理解，导致无法区分AI应该解决什么问题、能解决什么问题以及将解决什么问题，将这些类别视为互相可替代的。这种理解上的缺乏导致AI规划与实施之间的脱节，因为规划基于AI应该解决的愿景，而不考虑它是否能够或将会解决。为了解决这一挑战，本研究介绍了LeanAI方法。该方法使用AEC行业的数据进行了开发。",
