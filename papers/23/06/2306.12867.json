    "abstract": "In this paper we present a method for single-channel wind noise reduction using our previously proposed diffusion-based stochastic regeneration model combining predictive and generative modelling. We introduce a non-additive speech in noise model to account for the non-linear deformation of the membrane caused by the wind flow and possible clipping. We show that our stochastic regeneration model outperforms other neural-network-based wind noise reduction methods as well as purely predictive and generative models, on a dataset using simulated and real-recorded wind noise. We further show that the proposed method generalizes well by testing on an unseen dataset with real-recorded wind noise. Audio samples, data generation scripts and code for the proposed methods can be found online (https://uhh.de/inf-sp-storm-wind).",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种单通道风噪音降低方法，使用了我们先前提出的结合预测和生成建模的基于扩散的随机再生模型。我们引入了一个非加性的语音噪声模型来解释膜的非线性变形，这种变形是由风流和可能的剪裁引起的。我们证明了我们的随机再生模型在使用模拟和真实记录的风噪声数据集上表现优于其他基于神经网络的风噪声降低方法以及纯预测和生成模型。我们进一步展示了所提出的方法在未见过的真实记录的风噪声数据集上具有很好的泛化性能。所提出方法的音频样本，数据生成脚本和代码可以在线上找到(https://uhh.de/inf-sp-storm-wind)。",
