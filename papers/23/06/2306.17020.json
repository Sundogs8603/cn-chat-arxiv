    "translated_abstract": "基于犯罪行为事实来确定犯罪类型的任务在社会科学中变得非常重要和有意义。但该领域面临的问题是，由于犯罪本身的性质，数据样本本身分布不均匀。同时，司法领域的数据集少有公开可用，无法产生用于直接训练的大型数据集。本文提出了一种通过NLP处理方法解决该问题的新的训练模型。我们首先提出了一个犯罪事实数据预处理模块(CFDPM)，通过生成新样本来平衡不均匀的数据集分布的缺陷。然后，我们使用一个大型开源数据集(CAIL-big)作为我们的预训练数据集，使用我们自己收集的一个小数据集进行微调，赋予模型对不熟悉的小数据集具有良好的泛化能力。同时，我们使用改进的Bert模型和动态遮蔽来改进模型。实验证明",
