    "translated_abstract": "最近，文本到表格生成任务因其广泛应用而受到越来越多的关注。在这个方面，主导模型将该任务形式化为序列到序列生成任务，并通过在训练期间将每个表格串行化为令牌序列，通过从上到下连接所有行。然而，它存在两个严重缺陷：1）预定义的顺序在训练期间引入了错误的偏差，高度惩罚行之间的顺序移动；2）当模型输出长标记序列时，错误传播问题变得严重。在本文中，我们首先进行了初步研究，以证明大多数行的生成是和顺序无关的。此外，我们提出了一种新的序列到序列&集合文本到表格生成模型。具体而言，除了文本编码器之外，我们的模型还配备了一个表头生成器，以顺序方式首先输出表头，即表格的第一行。",
