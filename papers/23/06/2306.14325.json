    "abstract": "Human beings are social creatures. We routinely reason about other agents, and a crucial component of this social reasoning is inferring people's goals as we learn about their actions. In many settings, we can perform intuitive but reliable goal inference from language descriptions of agents, actions, and the background environments. In this paper, we study this process of language driving and influencing social reasoning in a probabilistic goal inference domain. We propose a neuro-symbolic model that carries out goal inference from linguistic inputs of agent scenarios. The \"neuro\" part is a large language model (LLM) that translates language descriptions to code representations, and the \"symbolic\" part is a Bayesian inverse planning engine. To test our model, we design and run a human experiment on a linguistic goal inference task. Our model closely matches human response patterns and better predicts human judgements than using an LLM alone.",

    "translated_abstract": "人类是社交性的生物。我们经常推理其他智能体，而这种社交推理的关键部分是在了解他们的行为时推断他们的目标。在许多情况下，我们可以从语言描述的智能体、动作和背景环境中进行直观但可靠的目标推断。在本文中，我们研究了在一个概率目标推断领域中，语言驱动和影响社交推理的过程。我们提出了一个神经符号模型，该模型从智能体场景的语言输入中进行目标推断。其中的“神经”部分是一个大型语言模型（LLM），将语言描述转化为代码表示，而“符号”部分则是一个贝叶斯反向规划引擎。为了测试我们的模型，我们设计和进行了一个关于语言目标推断任务的人类实验。我们的模型与人类的反应模式非常相似，并且比单独使用LLM更好地预测了人类的判断。",
