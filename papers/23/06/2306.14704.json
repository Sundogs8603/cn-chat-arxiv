    "translated_abstract": "新概念的提及经常出现在文本中，需要自动化的方法将其收集并放置到知识库（例如本体和分类系统）中。现有的数据集存在三个问题：（一）大部分假设新概念已经被发现，不能支持概念发现；（二）只使用概念标签作为输入，缺乏概念标签的上下文信息；（三）主要关注与原子概念的分类，而不是复杂概念（包含逻辑运算符）的放置。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个新的基准，使用2014年和2017年的SNOMED CT版本适配MedMentions数据集（PubMed摘要），涵盖疾病子类别和更广泛的临床发现、过程以及制药/生物产品类别。我们用该数据集评估了概念发现和放置的工作，并对其进行了使用方式的说明。",
