    "translated_abstract": "谣言传播者越来越多地使用多媒体内容来吸引新闻消费者的注意力和信任。虽然有不少谣言检测模型利用了多模态数据，但它们很少考虑图像和文本之间的不一致语义，也很少发现发布内容和背景知识之间的不一致性。此外，它们通常假设多种模态的完整性，因此无法处理现实生活场景中可能出现的缺失模态。受到社交媒体中谣言更容易具有不一致语义的启发，提出了一种新颖的基于知识引导的双一致性网络，用于检测带有多媒体内容的谣言。它使用两个一致性检测子网络同时捕获跨模态级别和内容-知识级别的不一致性。它还利用特殊的标记，在不同的缺失视觉模态条件下实现了稳健的多模态表示学习。",
