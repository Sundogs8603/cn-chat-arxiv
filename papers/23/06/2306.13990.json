    "translated_abstract": "标签噪声在机器学习数据集中普遍存在。鉴定和消除标签噪声至关重要，因为在噪声数据上训练的模型会大幅降低准确性和泛化性。大多数现有的标签噪声检测方法都是为分类任务设计的，而基于结果预测分析的数据清理相对未被探索。受到交叉验证中不同折的性能波动的启发，我们提出了用于标签噪声估计的重复交叉验证（ReCoV）来填补这一空白。ReCoV通过记录每个最差表现折中的样本ID来构建一个噪声直方图，以此来排名样本的噪声水平。我们进一步提出了三种基于噪声直方图来鉴别嘈杂样本的方法，以解决越来越复杂的噪声分布。我们展示了ReCoV在分类任务基准中的优越表现，优于现有最先进标签清理算法。更重要的是，",
