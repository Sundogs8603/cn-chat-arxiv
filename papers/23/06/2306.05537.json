    "translated_abstract": "互联网上信息的快速增长导致各种活动、产品和服务上有压倒性的意见和评论。这使得用户在做决策时处理所有可用信息变得困难和耗时。文本摘要是一项自然语言处理任务，已被广泛探索，可通过从长文档或多个文件中生成简短而显著的内容来帮助用户快速检索相关信息。最近预训练语言模型（如ChatGPT）的进展展示了大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本生成方面的潜力。然而，LLMs需要大量的数据和资源，并且难以作为离线应用实现。此外，现有的文本摘要方法常常缺乏“自适应”能力，无法捕捉到多样化的方面，这对具有特定要求或偏好的用户特别不利。本文提出了一种方面自适应的知识驱动意见摘要方法。",
