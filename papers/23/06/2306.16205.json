    "abstract": "While it has long been recognized that a team of individual learning agents can be greater than the sum of its parts, recent work has shown that larger teams are not necessarily more effective than smaller ones. In this paper, we study why and under which conditions certain team structures promote effective learning for a population of individual learning agents. We show that, depending on the environment, some team structures help agents learn to specialize into specific roles, resulting in more favorable global results. However, large teams create credit assignment challenges that reduce coordination, leading to large teams performing poorly compared to smaller ones. We support our conclusions with both theoretical analysis and empirical results.",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然长期以来人们已经认识到一个由个体学习代理组成的团队可以超越其个体的能力，但最近的研究表明，规模较大的团队并不一定比规模较小的团队更有效。在本文中，我们研究了为个体学习代理群体提供有效学习的某些团队结构为何以及在哪些条件下能够提供有效学习。我们发现，在不同的环境中，某些团队结构有助于代理学习专业化到具体角色，从而产生更好的整体结果。然而，大团队存在责任归因难题，导致协调性降低，大团队表现较小团队差。我们通过理论分析和实证结果支持了我们的结论。",
