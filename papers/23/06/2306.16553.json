    "abstract": "We study binary opinion formation in a large population where individuals are influenced by the opinions of other individuals. The population is characterised by the existence of (i) communities where individuals share some similar features, (ii) opinion leaders that may trigger unpredictable opinion shifts in the short term (iii) some degree of incomplete information in the observation of the individual or public opinion processes. In this setting, we study three different approximate mechanisms: common sampling approximation, independent sampling approximation, and, what will be our main focus in this paper, McKean-Vlasov (or mean-field) approximation. We show that all three approximations perform well in terms of different metrics that we introduce for measuring population level and individual level errors. In the presence of a common noise represented by the major influencers opinions processes, and despite the absence of idiosyncratic noises, we derive a propagation of chaos type ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在一个大规模人口中的二元意见形成问题，个体的意见受其他个体的影响。该人口具有以下特征：(i) 个体属于具有相似特征的社区，(ii) 存在能在短期内引发意见转变的意见领袖，(iii) 在个体或公共意见过程的观察中存在某种程度的信息不完全性。在这个设置下，我们研究了三种不同的近似机制：常见采样近似、独立采样近似以及我们在本文中的主要关注点 - McKean-Vlasov (或平均场) 近似。我们展示了这三种近似在我们引入的用于衡量整体和个体级误差的不同度量标准上表现良好。在主要影响者意见过程中存在一种共同噪声的情况下，尽管缺少特质噪声，我们得出了一种混沌传播类型的结果。",
