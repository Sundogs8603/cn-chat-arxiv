    "abstract": "With the advent of mobile phone photography and point-and-shoot cameras, deep-burst imaging is widely used for a number of photographic effects such as depth of field, super-resolution, motion deblurring, and image denoising. In this work, we propose to solve the problem of deep-burst image denoising by including an optical flow-based correspondence estimation module which aligns all the input burst images with respect to a reference frame. In order to deal with varying noise levels the individual burst images are pre-filtered with different settings. Exploiting the established correspondences one network block predicts a pixel-wise spatially-varying filter kernel to smooth each image in the original and prefiltered bursts before fusing all images to generate the final denoised output. The resulting pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results by combining all available information provided by the burst.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着移动手机摄影和点拍相机的出现，深度爆发成像被广泛用于各种摄影效果，例如景深、超分辨率、运动去模糊和图像去噪。本文提出了一种包含基于光流的对应估计模块的解决方案，以解决深度爆发图像去噪问题。为了处理不同的噪声水平，对每个图像进行不同的预过滤设置。利用建立的对应关系，一个网络块可以预测每个图像的像素级可变滤波器核，以平滑原始和预处理的爆发图像，然后融合所有图像生成最终去噪输出。该流程通过组合爆发提供的所有信息，实现了最先进的结果。",
