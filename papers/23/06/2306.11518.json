    "translated_abstract": "文本摘要生成是自然语言处理中一项重要任务，研究人员多年来已经开发了各种方法，从基于规则的系统到神经网络。然而，并没有一种单一的模型或方法可以在所有类型的文本上表现良好。我们提出了一种系统，为给定的文本推荐最适合的摘要生成模型。所提出的系统采用了一个全连接神经网络，分析输入内容并预测哪种摘要生成器在给定输入的ROUGE分数方面表现最佳。元模型在四种不同的斯洛文摘要生成模型之间选择，这些模型是针对斯洛文语言开发的，使用输入的不同属性，特别是其Doc2Vec文档表示。这四个斯洛文摘要生成模型解决了与在语言资源有限的语言中进行文本摘要的不同挑战。我们自动评估了所提出的SloMetaSum模型的性能，并进行了部分手动评估。结果显示，所提出的模型在斯洛文摘要生成上表现良好。",
