    "translated_abstract": "当基站具有下行通道状态信息（CSI）时，可以充分利用大规模多输入多输出（MIMO）在频分双工（FDD）模式下的潜力。本文提出了基于深度学习的联合信道估计和反馈框架，以实现大规模MIMO系统中的信道估计和反馈。具体而言，我们采用传统通道设计而非端到端方法。我们的模型包含两个网络。第一个网络是信道估计网络，采用双重损失设计，可以准确地估计完整的信道信息并消除信道噪声。第二个网络是压缩和反馈网络。受掩码Token Transformer的启发，我们提出了一种可学习的掩码Token方法，以获得出色的估计和压缩性能。广泛的仿真结果和削弱研究表明，我们的方法优于最先进的信道估计和反馈方法。",
