    "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the possible relationship between the mechanisms of social influence and the choice of airline, through the use of new tools, with the aim of understanding whether they can contribute to a better understanding of the factors influencing the decisions of consumers in the aviation sector. We have chosen to extract user reviews from well-known platforms: Trustpilot, Google, and Twitter. By combining web scraping techniques, we have been able to collect a comprehensive dataset comprising a wide range of user opinions, feedback, and ratings. We then refined the BERT model to focus on insightful sentiment in the context of airline reviews. Through our analysis, we observed an intriguing trend of average negative sentiment scores across various airlines, giving us deeper insight into the dynamics between airlines and helping us identify key partnerships, popular routes, and airlines that play a central role in the aeronautical ecosystem of Catania airport during",
