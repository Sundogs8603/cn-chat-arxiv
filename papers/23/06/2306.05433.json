    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了一个一般的有限玩家带有平均场相互作用的随机博弈，其中线性二次成本函数包括作用于$L^2$中的控制的线性算子。我们提出了一种新的方法，通过将相关的一阶条件减少到第二类随机Fredholm方程组的系统，并推导出它们的闭形式解来明确推导出了博弈的纳什均衡。此外，通过证明随机Fredholm方程组的稳定性结果，我们推导出了$N$人博弈的均衡收敛到相应的平均场均衡。作为一个副产品，我们还推导出了平均场博弈的$\\varepsilon$-纳什均衡，在这种情况下，它具有价值，因为我们表明，在平均场极限存在均衡的条件比有限玩家博弈的条件要少。最后，我们将我们的一般框架应用于解决各种例子。",
