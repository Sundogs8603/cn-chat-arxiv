Humans cause 90% of them (negligence or provoked) and the behaviour of individuals is unpredictable. However, atmospheric and environmental variables affect the spread of wildfires, and they can be analysed by using deep learning. In order to mitigate the damage of these events we proposed the novel Wildfire Assessment Model (WAM). Our aim is to anticipate the economic and ecological impact of a wildfire, assisting managers resource allocation and decision making for dangerous regions in Spain, Castilla y Le\\'on and Andaluc\\'ia. The WAM uses a residual-style convolutional network architecture to perform regression over atmospheric variables and the greenness index, computing necessary resources, the control and extinction time, and the expected burnt surface area. It is first pre-trained with self-supervision over 100,000 examples of unlabelled data with a masked patch prediction objective and fine-tun",

    "translated_abstract": "每年，山火摧毁了西班牙更大的面积，威胁着众多生态系统。90%由人类引起（疏忽或故意）且个体行为不可预测。然而，大气和环境变量影响森林火灾的传播，它们可以使用深度学习进行分析。为了减轻这些事件的损害，我们提出了新型森林火灾评估模型（WAM）。我们的目标是预测森林火灾的经济和生态影响，协助管理者为西班牙的危险地区，卡斯蒂利亚-莱昂和安达卢西亚进行资源分配和决策。WAM使用残差式卷积网络结构对大气变量和绿度指数执行回归，计算必要的资源，控制和灭火时间以及预期烧伤面积。它首先在100,000个未标记数据的自我监督学习中进行预训练，并通过标记数据的监督回归任务进行微调。结果表明，该模型在平均绝对误差和决定系数方面优于传统方法。",
