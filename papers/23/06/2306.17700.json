    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究提出了一些修改语音以防止性别推测攻击的方法。这些保护算法的目标是控制关于演讲者性别这个隐私敏感属性的信息的可用性。目前，开发和测试性别保护算法的常见做法是 \"神经网络之间的\"，即通过神经网络生成和测试扰动。在本文中，我们提出超越这种做法以加强对性别保护的研究。首先，我们证明了测试基于语音科学家历史上开发的语音特征的性别推测攻击的重要性，同时还与传统的神经分类器进行比较。接下来，我们认为研究人员应该使用语音特征来洞察保护性修改如何改变语音信号。最后，我们指出性别保护算法应该与新型的 \"语音对手\"，即人类执行的声音适应进行比较。",
