    "translated_abstract": "主动脉瓣狭窄(AS)是一种导致严重发病率和死亡率的退行性瓣膜疾病。这种情况经常被低估和低治疗。在临床实践中，AS是通过超声心动图的专家审查来诊断的，这会产生数十个下肺采样的超声图像。只有一些视图显示主动脉瓣。为了自动化筛查AS，深度网络必须学习模仿人类专家识别主动脉瓣视图的能力，然后汇总这些相关图像以产生研究级诊断。我们发现先前的AS检测方法由于依赖于跨图像的不灵活平均值而导致精度不足。我们进一步发现，现成的基于注意力的多实例(MIL)学习表现不佳。我们提出了一种新的端到端MIL方法，包含两个关键方法创新。首先，通过监督式注意技术，引导学习的注意机制偏爱相关视图。其次，一种新颖的自我监督学习技术提高了每个单独图像的表现。我们的方法在一个真实的临床数据集（4569名患者）上实现了最先进的性能，在传统的机器学习和深度学习方法之上。",
