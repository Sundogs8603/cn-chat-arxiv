    "abstract": "The ability to conduct retrospective analyses of attacks on human rights defenders over time and by location is important for humanitarian organizations to better understand historical or ongoing human rights violations and thus better manage the global impact of such events. We hypothesize that NLP can support such efforts by quickly processing large collections of news articles to detect and summarize the characteristics of attacks on human rights defenders. To that end, we propose a new dataset for detecting Attacks on Human Rights Defenders (HRDsAttack) consisting of crowdsourced annotations on 500 online news articles. The annotations include fine-grained information about the type and location of the attacks, as well as information about the victim(s). We demonstrate the usefulness of the dataset by using it to train and evaluate baseline models on several sub-tasks to predict the annotated characteristics.",

    "translated_abstract": "能够对人权捍卫者的攻击进行历史性和地域性的回顾性分析对于人道主义组织更好地了解历史或正在进行的人权侵犯，并因此更好地管理此类事件的全球影响至关重要。我们假设自然语言处理可以通过快速处理大量新闻文章来检测和总结对人权捍卫者的攻击的特征，从而支持这些努力。为此，我们提出了一个新的用于检测对人权捍卫者的攻击的数据集（HRDsAttack），包括对500篇在线新闻文章的众包注释。这些注释包括对攻击类型和地点以及受害者信息的细粒度信息。我们通过使用该数据集训练和评估基准模型在几个子任务上预测注释特征的方法来展示数据集的实用性。",
