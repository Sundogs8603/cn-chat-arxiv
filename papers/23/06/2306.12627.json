    "translated_abstract": "自编码器已广泛用于最近的异常检测技术开发中。它们的应用前提是在正常训练数据上训练自编码器后，异常输入将表现出显著的重构误差。因此，这使得正常和异常样本之间有了明显的区别。然而，在实践中观察到，自编码器可以一定程度上泛化到正常类之外，并在一些异常样本上实现较小的重构误差。为了改善性能，各种技术提出了其他组件和更复杂的训练程序。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个非常简单的替代方法：不是添加神经网络组件、涉及计算和繁琐的训练，而是通过在潜在空间中调节表示的范数，用一个计算简单的项来补充重构损失。我们方法的简单性最小化了复杂性。",
    "tldr": "本文提出一种在自编码器的损失函数中添加一个轻量级的约束项，用于解决传统自编码器在异常检测中的不足，并取得了良好的表现。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a simple yet effective approach for anomaly detection using autoencoders, by adding a computationally light term to the reconstrunction loss in the latent space to regulate the norm of representations in the space. This method outperforms traditional autoencoders in detecting anomalies."
