    "translated_abstract": "分子属性通常只能通过有限数目的样本观测到，研究人员将属性预测视为少样本问题。先前的研究忽视了一个重要事实，即每个分子可以同时记录多个不同的属性。为了有效利用分子和属性之间的多对多关系，我们提出了一种基于图采样的元学习（GS-Meta）框架，用于少样本分子属性预测。首先，我们构建了一个分子-属性关系图（MPG）：分子和属性作为节点，而属性标签决定边。然后，为了利用MPG的拓扑信息，我们将元学习中的一个episode重新定义为MPG的子图，其中包含目标属性节点、分子节点和辅助属性节点。第三，由于子图形式的episode不再相互独立，我们提出使用对比损失函数来调度子图采样过程，以确保采样的episode具有对比性。",
