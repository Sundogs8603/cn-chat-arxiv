    "translated_abstract": "在大型数据集上预训练神经网络获得的表示已被越来越多地成功应用于各种下游任务中。在本文中，我们更加深入地研究了这种预训练表示中的特征是如何被编码的。我们发现，在给定层中学到的表示展现出一定程度的扩散冗余，即对于超过一个阈值大小的任何随机子集神经元，都与完整层具有很高的相似度，并且在各种下游任务中能够表现出与整个层相似的性能。我们在各种不同的神经架构（包括CNN和Transformer）上进行了实验，使用了ImageNet1k和ImageNet21k进行预训练，并评估了各种下游任务，如图像分类、目标检测和自然语言处理。我们的实验结果表明，可以利用预训练表示中的冗余来降低在实际部署中使用这些模型的计算和内存成本，同时仍然保持相当的性能水平。",
