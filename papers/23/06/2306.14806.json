    "translated_abstract": "文档级关系抽取的目标是识别跨多个句子的实体之间的关系。最近，文档级关系抽取中的不完整标注问题引起了越来越多的关注，一些研究采用正负样本学习等方法来解决这个问题，但仍有很大的改进空间。受此启发，我们提出了一种正样本增强和正样本混合的正负样本度量学习框架（P3M）。具体而言，我们将文档级关系抽取形式化为度量学习问题。我们旨在拉近实体对嵌入和它们对应的关系嵌入之间的距离，同时将它们与非类别关系嵌入的距离推远。此外，我们将正负样本学习方法应用于该损失目标。为了提高模型的泛化能力，我们使用了dropout来增加正样本，并提出了正-非类别混合方法。大量实验证明了P3M的改进效果。",
