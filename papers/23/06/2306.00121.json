    "abstract": "Figures of speech help people express abstract concepts and evoke stronger emotions than literal expressions, thereby making texts more creative and engaging. Due to its pervasive and fundamental character, figurative language understanding has been addressed in Natural Language Processing, but it's highly understudied in a multilingual setting and when considering more than one figure of speech at the same time. To bridge this gap, we introduce multilingual multi-figurative language modelling, and provide a benchmark for sentence-level figurative language detection, covering three common figures of speech and seven languages. Specifically, we develop a framework for figurative language detection based on template-based prompt learning. In so doing, we unify multiple detection tasks that are interrelated across multiple figures of speech and languages, without requiring task- or language-specific modules. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms several strong baselines",

    "translated_abstract": "比喻语言有助于人们表达抽象概念、唤起比字面表达更强的情感，从而使文本更加有创造力和吸引力。尽管比喻语言理解在自然语言处理中得到了广泛研究，但在多语言环境和考虑多个修辞手法时，其研究仍然非常有限。为了弥补这一差距，我们引入了多语言多比喻语言建模，并提供了一个基准句子级比喻语言检测，涵盖了三种常见的修辞手法和七种语言。具体而言，我们基于基于模板的提示学习开发了一个比喻语言检测框架。通过这样做，我们统一了跨多个修辞手法和语言相关的多个检测任务，而无需特定于任务或语言的模块。实验结果表明，我们的框架优于几个强大的基线模型。",
