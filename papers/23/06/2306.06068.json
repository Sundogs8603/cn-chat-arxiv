    "translated_abstract": "如今，移动设备可以不断跟踪用户的位置，位置轨迹可用于推断个人兴趣点(POI)，如家庭、工作场所或商店。提取POI的常见方法是首先识别用户花费大量时间的时空区域，即停留区域(SR)。常见的SR提取方法要么仅评估无监督方法，要么在小规模私有数据集上进行评估，因为流行的公共数据集是未标记的。大多数这些方法依赖于手工特征或阈值，并且无法超出超参数优化范围。因此，我们提出了一个弱监督的自监督变压器模型DeepStay，它是在位置轨迹上训练的，用于预测停留区域。据我们所知，这是第一个基于深度学习的方法，也是第一个在公共标记数据集上进行评估的方法。我们的SR提取方法优于最先进的方法。此外，我们提出了一种从停留区域中提取个人POI的方法。我们的方法不依赖于任何个人信息，例如家庭或工作地址，也不需要除位置轨迹以外的其他数据。",
