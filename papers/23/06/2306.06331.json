The dataset included 250 questions divided into four levels: knowledge (K), comprehension (C), application (A), and high application (H), and it included ten themes that covered diverse mathematical concepts. The outcomes demonstrate that ChatGPT's performance varies depending on the difficulty level and subject. It performed best on questions at Level (K), with an accuracy rate of $83\\%$; but, as the difficulty level rose, it scored poorly, with an accuracy rate of $10\\%$. The study has also shown that ChatGPT significantly succeeds in providing responses to questions on subjects including exponential and logarithmic functions, geometric progression, and arithmetic progression. The study found that ChatGPT had difficulty correctly answering questions on t",
