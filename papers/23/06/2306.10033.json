    "abstract": "Reproducibility is a key aspect for scientific advancement across disciplines, and reducing barriers for open science is a focus area for the theme of Interspeech 2023. Availability of source code is one of the indicators that facilitates reproducibility. However, less is known about the rates of reproducibility at Interspeech conferences in comparison to other conferences in the field. In order to fill this gap, we have surveyed 27,717 papers at seven conferences across speech and language processing disciplines. We find that despite having a close number of accepted papers to the other conferences, Interspeech has up to 40% less source code availability. In addition to reporting the difficulties we have encountered during our research, we also provide recommendations and possible directions to increase reproducibility for further studies.",

    "translated_abstract": "可重复性是横跨学科的科学进展的关键方面，降低开放科学的障碍是Interspeech 2023主题的焦点领域。源代码的可用性是促进可重复性的指标之一。然而，与领域内其他会议相比，Interspeech会议的再现率较低是我们鲜有了解的。为了填补这个空白，我们对跨越语音和语言处理学科的七个会议的27,717篇论文进行了调查。我们发现，尽管接受的论文数量与其他会议相近，但Interspeech的可用源代码较少，达到40%。除了报告我们在研究过程中遇到的困难，我们还提供了建议和可能的方向，以增加可重复性进行进一步研究。",
