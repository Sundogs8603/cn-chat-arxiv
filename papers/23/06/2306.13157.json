    "translated_abstract": "预判性思维能够推动我们在日常生活中管理风险——识别和缓解风险，从带雨伞到购买汽车保险。随着人工智能系统成为日常生活的一部分，它们也开始管理风险。自主驾驶汽车行驶了数百万英里，星际争霸和围棋代理具有与人类类似的能力，隐含地管理着对手提出的风险。为了进一步提高这些任务的性能，超分布式评估可以描述模型的偏差，我们认为这是一种风险管理。然而，学习识别和缓解低频高影响的风险与训练机器学习模型所需的观察偏差是相互冲突的。星际争霸和围棋是封闭的领域，其风险已知并且缓解方案有良好的记录，适合通过重复学习来实现。对抗筛选数据集提供了困难的例子，但数据集的筛选和建立是费时的，也不具备动态性，这都是实际风险管理的障碍。",
