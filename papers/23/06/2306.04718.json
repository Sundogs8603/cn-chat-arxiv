    "translated_abstract": "符号回归是一种从数据中发现分析数学表达式的强有力技术，由于其良好的结果可解释性，在自然科学中应用广泛。然而，现有的方法在处理涉及多个变量的复杂方程时面临可伸缩性问题。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了 SRCV，一种新颖的神经符号回归方法，利用控制变量来增强精度和可扩展性。核心思想是将多变量符号回归分解为一组单变量 SR 问题，然后从底部向上组合。该方法包括四个步骤。首先，我们使用深度神经网络（DNN）从观察到的数据中学习数据生成器。其次，使用数据生成器通过控制输入变量来生成特定变量的样本。第三，应用单变量符号回归来估计相应的数学表达式。",
