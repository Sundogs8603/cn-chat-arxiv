    "translated_abstract": "二维人体姿态估计的主流方案之一是通过神经网络学习关键点热图。现有方法通常通过定制化的架构（如高分辨率表示和视觉Transformer）改进热图的质量。本文提出了DiffusionPose，一种新的方案，将二维人体姿态估计表述为从噪声热图生成关键点热图的问题。在训练过程中，通过添加噪声将关键点扩散到随机分布，扩散模型学习根据图像特征构建的条件从噪声热图中恢复出真实的热图。在推断过程中，扩散模型以逐步去噪的方式从初始化热图生成热图。此外，我们进一步探索通过人体结构信息改善DiffusionPose的性能。大量实验显示了我们的DiffusionPose的优越性，分别提高了1.6、1.2和1.2 mAP。",
