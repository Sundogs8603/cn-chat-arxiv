    "translated_abstract": "股票趋势预测是量化投资的基本任务之一，准确预测价格趋势是不可或缺的。作为一项在线服务，股票数据随时随地持续到达。使用最新数据对预测模型进行增量更新是实用而高效的，因为这些新数据可能揭示了未来股票市场中会重复出现的一些新模式。然而，由于分布漂移（即概念漂移）的挑战，股票趋势预测的增量学习仍然没有得到充分探索。随着股票市场动态演变，未来数据的分布可能会与增量数据稍微或显着地不同，从而阻碍增量更新的有效性。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一个利用两个适配器的端到端框架——DoubleAdapt，可以有效地适应数据和模型，以减轻分布漂移的影响。我们的关键洞察力是利用元学习技术自动学习如何将股票数据适应到本地平稳分布空间中。",
