    "abstract": "Recent years have shown a rapid adoption of residential solar PV with increased self-consumption and self-sufficiency levels in Europe. A major driver for their economic viability is the electricity tax exemption for the consumption of self-produced electricity. This leads to large residential PV capacities and partially overburdened distribution grids. Furthermore, the tax exemption that benefits wealthy households that can afford capital-intense investments in solar panels in particular has sparked discussions about energy equity and the appropriate taxation level for self-consumption. This study investigates the implementation of uniform electricity taxes on all consumption, irrespective of the origin of the production, by means of a case study of 155,000 hypothetical Danish prosumers.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，欧洲家庭太阳能光伏的数量迅速增长，以及自我消费和自我满足水平的提高使得其经济可行性不断提升。其中一个重要的驱动因素是对自我生产用电的电费免税政策。这导致了大量家庭太阳能光伏容量和部分超负荷的配电网。此外，受益于免税政策的主要是那些能够承担资本密集型太阳能电池板投资的富裕家庭，这引发了有关能源公平和自我消费合适税收水平的讨论。本研究通过对15.5万个假设的丹麦会自我生产电力的个人家庭进行案例研究，调查了对任何来源的电力消费实行统一的电费税的实施。结果表明，新的税收政策逐渐将成本在不同家庭中累进地进行了重新分配。随着对越来越多的消费征税，税收水平可以降低38％，使61％的家庭承担更低的税负。此外，通过激励消费模式的灵活性，可以为所有家庭节约总体成本。",
