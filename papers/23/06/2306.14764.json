    "translated_abstract": "政治演讲中仇恨言论的检测是一个关键问题，而在低资源语言中更具挑战性。为了解决这个问题，我们介绍了一个名为IEHate的新数据集，其中包含11,457条手动标注的与2021年11月1日至2022年3月9日期间印度州立选举活动相关的印地语推文。我们对数据集进行了详细分析，重点关注政治交流中仇恨言论的普遍性和使用的不同形式的憎恨语言。此外，我们使用一系列机器学习、深度学习和基于transformer的算法对数据集进行了基准测试。我们的实验表明，这些模型的性能可以进一步提高，强调了在低资源语言中检测仇恨言论需要更高级的技术。特别是，人工评估相对较高的得分强调了利用人工和自动化方法的重要性，以实现有效的仇恨言论检测。",
