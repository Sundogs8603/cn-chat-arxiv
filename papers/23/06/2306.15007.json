    "abstract": "Context: An increasing demand is observed in various domains to employ Machine Learning (ML) for solving complex problems. ML models are implemented as software components and deployed in Machine Learning Software Systems (MLSSs). Problem: There is a strong need for ensuring the serving quality of MLSSs. False or poor decisions of such systems can lead to malfunction of other systems, significant financial losses, or even threats to human life. The quality assurance of MLSSs is considered a challenging task and currently is a hot research topic. Objective: This paper aims to investigate the characteristics of real quality issues in MLSSs from the viewpoint of practitioners. This empirical study aims to identify a catalog of quality issues in MLSSs. Method: We conduct a set of interviews with practitioners/experts, to gather insights about their experience and practices when dealing with quality issues. We validate the identified quality issues via a survey with ML practitioners. Result",
