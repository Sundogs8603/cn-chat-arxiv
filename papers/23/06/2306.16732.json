    "translated_abstract": "最近，多情景学习（MSL）在推荐和检索系统中被广泛应用于行业中，因为它有助于从不同情景中进行迁移学习，减轻了数据稀疏性并降低了维护成本。这些努力通过搜索更优网络结构（如辅助网络、专家网络和多塔网络）产生不同的MSL范式。不同的情景可以持有特定的特征，因此激活用户的意图会有所不同。换句话说，在不同的情景下，不同类型的辅助特征的重要性也会有所不同。通过以情景感知的方式优化更具有区分性的特征表示，可以轻松地获得更好的排序性能，而无需昂贵地搜索最优网络结构。不幸的是，这个简单的想法在实际系统中主要被忽视，但却是非常需要的。进一步的分析也验证了自适应特征学习的合理性。",
