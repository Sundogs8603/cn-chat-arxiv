    "abstract": "We study causal effect estimation from a mixture of observational and interventional data in a confounded linear regression model with multivariate treatments. We show that the statistical efficiency in terms of expected squared error can be improved by combining estimators arising from both the observational and interventional setting. To this end, we derive methods based on matrix weighted linear estimators and prove that our methods are asymptotically unbiased in the infinite sample limit. This is an important improvement compared to the pooled estimator using the union of interventional and observational data, for which the bias only vanishes if the ratio of observational to interventional data tends to zero. Studies on synthetic data confirm our theoretical findings. In settings where confounding is substantial and the ratio of observational to interventional data is large, our estimators outperform a Stein-type estimator and various other baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了多元治疗的混合观测数据和干预数据在混淆线性回归模型中的因果效应估计。我们表明，通过结合从观测和干预状态下得出的估计器，期望均方误差的统计效率可以得到提高。为此，我们基于矩阵加权线性估计器推导了方法，并证明了我们的方法在无限样本极限下是渐近无偏的。相比于使用干预数据和观测数据并集作为汇总估计器的情况，我们的方法具有重要的改进，因为只有当观测干预数据比的比例趋近于零时，其偏差才会消失。针对合成数据的研究进一步证明了我们的理论发现。在混淆严重且观测数据和干预数据的比例大的情况下，我们的估计器优于Stein型估计器和其他基准估计器。",
