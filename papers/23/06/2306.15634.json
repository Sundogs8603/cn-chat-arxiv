    "abstract": "The automatic annotation of direct speech (AADS) in written text has been often used in computational narrative understanding. Methods based on either rules or deep neural networks have been explored, in particular for English or German languages. Yet, for French, our target language, not many works exist. Our goal is to create a unified framework to design and evaluate AADS models in French. For this, we consolidated the largest-to-date French narrative dataset annotated with DS per word; we adapted various baselines for sequence labelling or from AADS in other languages; and we designed and conducted an extensive evaluation focused on generalisation. Results show that the task still requires substantial efforts and emphasise characteristics of each baseline. Although this framework could be improved, it is a step further to encourage more research on the topic.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动注释法语书面文本中的直接言语（AADS）经常在计算机叙述理解中使用。已经研究了基于规则或深度神经网络的方法，特别是针对英语或德语。然而，对于我们的目标语言法语，很少有相关研究。我们的目标是创建一个统一的框架，用于设计和评估法语中的AADS模型。为此，我们整合了迄今为止标注有每个单词的最大的法语叙述数据集；我们针对序列标注或其他语言的AADS适应了各种基线模型；并且我们设计并进行了广泛评估，重点是泛化能力。结果表明，这个任务仍然需要大量的工作，并强调了每个基线模型的特点。尽管这个框架可以改进，但它是鼓励更多关于这个主题的研究的一步。",
