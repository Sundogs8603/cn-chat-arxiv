    "translated_abstract": "在集成电路封装中建模信号完整性的一个关键问题是需要在所需频带内进行多个S参数测量以获得足够的分辨率。使用电磁场求解器获得这些样本通常是计算昂贵的。因此，常见方法是选择所需样本的一小部分，并使用适当的拟合机制重新创建密集采样的宽带表示。我们提出了一种基于深度生成模型的方法来使用一维深度图像先验（DIP）拟合来自EM求解器的S参数。DIP是一种技术，它优化随机初始化的卷积神经网络的权重以适应从噪声或欠定测量中的信号。我们设计了一个自定义架构，并提出了一种新颖的正则化技术，灵感来自平滑样条，以惩罚不连续的跳跃。我们在两种类型的无源滤波器上实验比较了DIP与公开可用的和专有的行业标准拟合方法，并展示了重建质量和计算时间的显着改进。",
