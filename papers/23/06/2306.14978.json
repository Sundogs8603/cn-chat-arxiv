    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们提出了针对子群的公平感知反事实论证（FACTS），这是一个通过反事实解释来审查子群公平性的框架。我们重新审视（并泛化）现有概念，并引入更精细的子群公平性概念。我们的目标是（a）在微观层面上考虑到子群成员个体，或在宏观层面上考虑整个子群，来表达某些子群个体在实现补救（即实现期望结果）方面的困难不同方面；以及（b）引入对于实现补救成本坚固的（如果不是完全无视的）子群公平性概念。我们结合这些概念提出了一个高效、模型无关、高度可参数化和可解释的框架来评估子群公平性。通过对不同基准测试的彻底实验评估，我们展示了我们的方法的优势、广泛适用性和效率。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了针对子群的公平感知反事实论证（FACTS）框架，用于通过反事实解释来审查子群的公平性。该框架重新定义了子群公平性概念，旨在从微观和宏观两个角度考虑实现期望结果的困难，并引入了对于实现成本具有鲁棒性的子群公平性概念。通过实验评估，证明了该方法的优势、适用性和效率。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents the FACTS framework for auditing subgroup fairness through counterfactual explanations. It introduces refined notions of subgroup fairness and provides an efficient and explainable framework for evaluating subgroup fairness. The framework considers the difficulties of achieving desired outcomes at both the individual and subgroup levels and introduces notions of fairness that are robust to the cost of achieving recourse. Overall, the approach demonstrates advantages, wide applicability, and efficiency."
