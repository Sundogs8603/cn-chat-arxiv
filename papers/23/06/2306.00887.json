    "translated_abstract": "开放词汇状态跟踪是一种在不限制状态空间和实体空间的情况下跟踪实体状态变化的更实用的状态跟踪方法。目前，OpenPI是唯一为开放词汇状态跟踪注释的数据集。然而，我们发现数据集质量和评估指标存在问题。针对数据集，我们分别在程序级别、步骤级别和状态变化级别上分类了3种问题，并利用多轮人工判断构建了干净的OpenPI-C数据集。针对评估指标，我们提出了一种基于聚类的指标，以修复原始指标对重复的偏好。在模型方面，我们通过恢复状态跟踪的两个关键属性，即时间依赖性和实体感知能力，增强了seq2seq生成基线模型。在执行操作后，世界状态从根本上依赖于先前状态。我们通过动态记忆库对这种依赖关系进行建模，并允许模型注意到实体。",
