We define a model of competition for classification tasks, and use data representations as a lens for studying the impact of increases in scale. We find many settings where improving data representation quality (as measured by Bayes risk) decreases the overall predictive accuracy across users (i.e., social welfare) for a marketplace of competing model-providers.

    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习模型规模的增长，缩放定律等趋势预计会导致预测准确性的持续改进。然而，这些趋势只考虑了单个模型供应商的视角，而实际上供应商之间常常竞争用户。本文证明了竞争可以从根本上改变这些缩放趋势的行为，甚至可能造成整体预测准确性随着规模的增大而非单调或降低。我们定义了一个分类任务的竞争模型，并使用数据表示作为研究规模增加的影响的镜头。我们发现在一家市场上，改善数据表示质量（按贝叶斯风险计量）可能会降低竞争模型供应商的整体预测准确性（即社会福利）。我们的例子涵盖了简单设置中的封闭式公式到预训练的 CIFAR-10 模拟。",
