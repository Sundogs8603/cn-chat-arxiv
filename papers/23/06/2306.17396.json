    "translated_abstract": "在Koopman算子理论中，通过一组可观测函数，将一个有限维的非线性系统转化为一个无穷但线性的系统。然而，基于先前知识手动选择能够覆盖Koopman算子不变子空间的可观测函数是低效和具有挑战性的，特别是在对底层系统几乎没有信息或没有任何信息的情况下。此外，目前的方法往往忽视可观测函数可逆性的重要性，导致结果不准确。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了所谓的FlowDMD，即基于流的动态模态分解，利用耦合流可逆神经网络（CF-INN）框架。FlowDMD利用CF-INN的内在可逆特性，学习Koopman算子的不变子空间，并准确重构状态变量。数值实验证明了我们的算法相比当前方法的卓越性能。",
