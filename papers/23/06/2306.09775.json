Currently, the region and planning group level size grids are built and managed manually. The company suffers from the workload it creates for sizing, merchant and planning teams.

    "translated_abstract": "时装服装公司需要提前一年规划下一个季度以进行供应链管理。该研究关注李维斯的尺码选择决策。目前，地区和计划小组级别的尺码表是手工建立和管理的，这给尺码、商家和计划团队带来了工作量。本研究旨在回答两个研究问题:“下一个季度每个尺码表名称下规划人员应该有哪些尺码可用？”和“下一个季度每个规划小组应采用哪些尺码？”我们使用一种分类模型来解决问题，这是机器学习中常用的模型之一。通过这项研究，使用机器学习技术创建了更为自动化的流程。预计在实践中投入使用后，公司团队的工作量将会减少。与时尚服装行业的许多研究不同，本研究聚焦于尺码问题。",
