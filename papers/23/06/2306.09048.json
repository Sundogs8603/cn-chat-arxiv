    "abstract": "Learning paradigms based purely on offline data as well as those based solely on sequential online learning have been well-studied in the literature. In this paper, we consider combining offline data with online learning, an area less studied but of obvious practical importance. We consider the stochastic $K$-armed bandit problem, where our goal is to identify the arm with the highest mean in the presence of relevant offline data, with confidence $1-\\delta$. We conduct a lower bound analysis on policies that provide such $1-\\delta$ probabilistic correctness guarantees. We develop algorithms that match the lower bound on sample complexity when $\\delta$ is small. Our algorithms are computationally efficient with an average per-sample acquisition cost of $\\tilde{O}(K)$, and rely on a careful characterization of the optimality conditions of the lower bound problem.",

    "translated_abstract": "文献中已经研究了基于纯离线数据和完全基于顺序在线学习的学习范式，但将离线数据与在线学习相结合的领域却鲜有研究，这是实际上十分重要的。本文考虑在相关离线数据存在的情况下，以$1-\\delta$的置信度识别出具有最高平均值的臂的随机K臂赌博机问题。我们对提供该$1-\\delta$概率正确性保证的策略进行了一个下界分析，并开发出能够在$\\delta$很小的情况下达到样本复杂性下界的算法。我们的算法在计算上非常高效，每个样本的收集成本平均为$\\tilde {O}(K)$，并且依赖于一个对较低问题的最优性条件的仔细刻画。",
