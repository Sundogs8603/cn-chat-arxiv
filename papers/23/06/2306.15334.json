    "translated_abstract": "传达的成功在很大程度上依赖于读取参与者的反应。这种反馈对于心理健康咨询师尤为重要，他们必须仔细考虑客户的进展并相应地调整自己的方法。然而，以往关于咨询的自然语言处理(NLP)研究主要集中在研究咨询师的干预策略，而不是客户对干预的反应。本研究旨在填补这一空白，通过开发一个基于理论的注释框架，涵盖咨询师的策略和客户反应行为。该框架已经在一个在线福利咨询平台上收集了过去两年的大规模、高质量的基于文本的咨询数据集，并经过了测试。我们的研究显示了客户如何对咨询师的策略做出反应，这样的反应如何影响最终的咨询结果，以及咨询师如何根据这些反应调整策略。我们还证明了这项研究可以帮助咨询师自动化地提供个性化的咨询服务。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates client reactions in online mental health counseling by developing an annotation framework and analyzing a large-scale text-based counseling dataset. It explores how clients react to counselors' strategies and the impact of these reactions on counseling outcomes, as well as providing insights on how counselors can adjust their strategies based on client reactions."
