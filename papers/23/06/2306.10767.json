    "abstract": "Several recent papers have recently shown that higher order graph neural networks can achieve better accuracy than their standard message passing counterparts, especially on highly structured graphs such as molecules. These models typically work by considering higher order representations of subgraphs contained within a given graph and then perform some linear maps between them. We formalize these structures as permutation equivariant tensors, or P-tensors, and derive a basis for all linear maps between arbitrary order equivariant P-tensors. Experimentally, we demonstrate this paradigm achieves state of the art performance on several benchmark datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的几篇论文表明，高阶图神经网络在高度结构化的图形如分子中能够比其标准的消息传递对应物获得更好的准确性。这些模型通常通过考虑包含在给定图形中的子图的高阶表示，然后在它们之间执行某些线性映射来工作。我们将这些结构正式化为排列等变张量或P张量，并推导出所有线性映射之间的任意顺序等变P张量的基础。在实验中，我们展示了这种范式在几个基准数据集上达到了现有最先进性能。",
