    "translated_abstract": "防火墙是通过筛选所有进入（以及偶尔出现的）数据包来保护通信网络安全的关键组件。过滤是通过将传入的数据包与一组旨在防止恶意代码进入网络的规则进行比较来进行的。为了调节进入和离开网络的数据包流，互联网防火墙跟踪所有活动。日志文件的主要功能是帮助故障排除和诊断，同时也与系统审计和取证相关。防火墙的主要功能是防止发送恶意数据包。为了更好地防御网络攻击并了解恶意操作何时以及如何影响互联网，有必要检查日志文件。因此，防火墙决定是否'允许'、'拒绝'、'丢弃'或'重置-双方'传入和传出的数据包。在这项研究中，我们应用各种分类算法进行多类分类以便更好地理解和分析互联网防火墙日志文件。",
