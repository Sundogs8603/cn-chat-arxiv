    "translated_abstract": "在文件取证领域，墨水分析在确定法律和历史文件的真实性以及检测伪造方面发挥着至关重要的作用。仅凭目视检查无法区分外观相似的墨水，必须采用先进的科学技术。本文提出了一种基于高光谱成像的墨水分析技术，可以在数百个狭窄的光谱带中检查文件，揭示隐藏的细节。本研究的主要目标是确定文档中使用的不同墨水的数量。采用了三种聚类算法，即k-means，Agglomerative和c-means，以估计存在的墨水数量。该方法涉及数据提取，墨水像素分割和墨水数确定。结果表明，所提出的技术在识别墨水聚类和区分不同墨水方面具有很好的效果。高光谱立方数据集的分析揭示了......（未完待续）",
