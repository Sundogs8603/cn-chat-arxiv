    "abstract": "Rapid and accurate building damage assessments from high-resolution satellite imagery following a natural disaster is essential to inform and optimize first responder efforts. However, performing such building damage assessments in an automated manner is non-trivial due to the challenges posed by variations in disaster-specific damage, diversity in satellite imagery, and the dearth of extensive, labeled datasets. To circumvent these issues, this paper introduces a human-in-the-loop workflow for rapidly training building damage assessment models after a natural disaster. This article details a case study using this workflow, executed in partnership with the American Red Cross during a tornado event in Rolling Fork, Mississippi in March, 2023. The output from our human-in-the-loop modeling process achieved a precision of 0.86 and recall of 0.80 for damaged buildings when compared to ground truth data collected post-disaster. This workflow was implemented end-to-end in under 2 hours per s",

    "translated_abstract": "自然灾害后通过高分辨率卫星图像进行快速准确的建筑损伤评估对于指导和优化第一应答者的努力至关重要。然而，由于不同的灾害损伤、卫星图像的多样性以及缺乏广泛的标记数据集等问题，以自动化方式执行此类建筑损伤评估并不容易。为了解决这些问题，本文介绍了一种人在循环工作流，用于在自然灾害后快速训练建筑损伤评估模型。该文章详细介绍了一个使用此工作流的案例研究，该工作流是与美国红十字会合作执行的，针对2023年3月密西西比州滚动叉口龙卷风事件。根据后灾情收集的地面真实数据，人在循环模型过程的输出在受损建筑方面实现了0.86的精度和0.80的召回率。这个工作流的端到端实现时间不到2个小时。",
