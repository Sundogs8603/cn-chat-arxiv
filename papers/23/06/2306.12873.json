    "translated_abstract": "近年来，随着机器学习模型在天气预报中的快速发展，最先进的机器学习模型在0.25度空间分辨率下的10天天气预报中已经表现出比欧洲中期天气预报中心(ECMWF)的高分辨率预报(HRES)更优越的性能。然而，挑战在于在15天预报中表现与ECMWF集合平均(EM)相当。以前的研究表明，缓解预报误差的积累对于有效的长期预报非常重要。尽管有许多减少积累误差的努力，包括自回归多时间步长损失，但使用单个模型发现无法在短和长导出时间上达到最佳性能。因此，我们提出了FuXi，这是一个级联机器学习天气预测系统，提供了分辨率为0.25度、时间分辨率为6小时的15天全球预测。FuXi基于级联集合模型开发，它集成了多种模型的优势，并减少了预测误差的积累。使用空气温度，比湿度和位势高度的均方根误差(RMSE)和异常相关系数(ACC)评估了FuXi的性能。结果表明，与ECMWF HRES相比，FuXi在15天预报中表现出更好的性能，并显著减少了积累误差。",
