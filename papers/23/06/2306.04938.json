    "translated_abstract": "视觉问答是一个跨学科的研究问题，通过自然语言处理和计算机视觉的实践追求解决。它能够根据图像的内容自动回答自然语言问题。某些测试问题需要外部知识才能得出解决方案。这种基于知识的视觉问答使用各种方法来检索图像和文本的特征，并将它们结合起来生成答案。为生成基于知识的答案，使用问题相关或图像相关的知识检索方法。如果获取有关图像中所有对象的知识，则不是所有知识都与问题相关。在另一方面，仅与问题相关的知识可能导致不正确的答案和过度训练的模型，这些模型回答与图像无关的问题。我们提出的方法将图像属性和问题特征作为输入输入到知识推导模块中，仅检索与问题相关的知识。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一种在视觉问答中提取问题相关知识的方法，避免了过度训练的模型错误地回答与图像无关的问题。",
