    "translated_abstract": "我们在标准的ResNet模型训练中提出了一种简单的修改方法--在特征空间中进行L2归一化--能够产生与最先进的OoD检测性能相媲美的结果。当在测试时移除L2归一化时，特征向量的L2范数成为网络不确定性的一个惊人的替代者，而当没有L2归一化训练时，这种行为却没有那么有效。直观上，熟悉的图像会产生大的向量，而陌生的图像则会产生小的向量。值得注意的是，在训练时几乎没有额外的成本，在测试时也没有成本。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a simple modification to the standard ResNet models by applying L2 normalization over feature space during training, which can achieve competitive Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection performance with almost no additional cost. The L2 norm of feature vectors serves as a good proxy for network uncertainty, making it possible to detect unfamiliar images during testing by just removing L2 normalization."
