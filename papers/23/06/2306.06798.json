Central to our method is Row Count Evolution (RCE), a novel plan generation algorithm based on perturbations in the sub-plan cardinality space. While previous approaches require accurate cost models, we bypass this requirement by evaluating candidate plans via actual execution data and training an ML model to predict the fastest plan given parameter binding values.

    "translated_abstract": "大多数现有的参数查询优化（PQO）技术依赖于传统的查询优化器成本模型，这些模型通常不准确，导致查询性能不佳。我们提出了Kepler，一种端到端的基于学习的PQO方法，在查询延迟方面显示出显著的加速。我们方法的核心是行计数演进（RCE），一种基于子计划基数空间扰动的新型计划生成算法。以前的方法需要准确的成本模型，而我们通过使用实际执行数据对候选计划进行评估，并训练一个机器学习模型来预测给定参数绑定值的最快计划，绕过了这一要求。我们的模型利用了神经网络不确定性的最新进展，以鲁棒地预测更快的计划，避免查询性能回归。在实验证明，Kepler 在多个 PostgreSQL 数据集上实现了查询运行时的显著改进。",
