    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络在解决各种图计算任务方面展现了出色的能力，特别是在节点分类方面表现出色。然而，在现实世界的图中，拓扑或节点信息中普遍存在的噪声测量挑战可能会影响其效果。观测中的这些不准确性可能会破坏图数据中的关键模式，最终导致实际应用中不良性能。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新颖的基于分布式鲁棒优化的不确定性感知图学习框架。具体而言，我们使用基于图神经网络的编码器来嵌入节点特征，并通过极小极大形式最小化最坏情况风险来找到最优节点嵌入。这种不确定性感知的学习过程导致了改进的节点表示和更强壮的图预测模型，有效地缓解了图数据中噪声测量的负面影响。",
