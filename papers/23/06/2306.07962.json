    "translated_abstract": "nuPlan的发布标志着车辆运动规划研究的一个新时代，提供了第一个需要精确的短期规划和长期目标预测的大规模真实世界数据集和评估方案。现有系统难以同时满足两个要求。实际上，我们发现这些任务存在根本上的不对齐问题，应该分别进行解决。我们进一步评估了领域内闭环规划的现状，揭示了学习为基础的方法在复杂的真实场景中的局限性，以及选择通过车道图搜索算法的简单基于规则的先验项（例如中心线选择）的价值。更令人惊讶的是，在开环子任务中，我们观察到当仅使用这个中心线作为场景上下文时（即忽略所有有关地图和其他代理的信息）可以获得最佳结果。结合这些见解，我们提出了一个非常简单高效的规划器，它的表现优于大量竞争对手。",
