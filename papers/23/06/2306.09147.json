    "translated_abstract": "在实践中收集的多元序列数据经常表现出时间的不规则性，包括非均匀时间间隔和组件错位。然而，如果不均匀的间距和异步是数据内生特征而不是不足观察的结果，则这些不规则性的信息内容在表征多元依赖结构时发挥决定性作用。现有的概率预测方法要么忽略了由此产生的统计异质性，要么易受到插补偏差的影响，要么将参数假设强加于数据分布上。本文提出了一种端到端解决方案，通过允许观察到达时间在模型构建中发挥核心作用来克服这些限制，这是时间不规则性的核心。为了认识到时间的不规则性，我们首先为组件启用唯一的隐藏状态，以便到达时间可以指导何时、如何和哪个隐藏状态应该更新。然后，我们通过一种新颖的非参数先验模型明确地融入了时间不规则性，该模型联合建模观测和隐藏状态，并自适应地捕获了跨组件的时间异质性和条件依赖性。我们使用合成数据和实际数据集展示了我们方法的优越性。",
