    "translated_abstract": "最近人工智能在化学、生物学和材料发现等领域引起了机器学习和科学界的极大关注。然而，由于这个领域的快速发展和科学界（如物理、化学和生物学）与机器学习界之间的知识差距，还没有进行过关于这些数据的几何表示的基准研究。为了解决这个问题，本文首先提供了当前对称性几何方法的统一视角，将其分类为三类：不变性、具有球形框架基础的等变性和具有向量框架基础的等变性。然后，我们提出了一个名为Geom3D的平台，可以对分子、蛋白质和晶体材料的不同几何表示进行系统的基准测评。利用Geom3D，我们进行了大量实验，评估了现有几何方法的性能，并提出了一种新的方法，它结合了球形框架基础和向量框架基础的等变性优点。我们的方法在各种数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了所提出的方法的有效性。",
