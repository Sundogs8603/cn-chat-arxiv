    "translated_abstract": "三维点云的时间序列，或称为4D点云，现在在多个应用中以日益增长的速度被获取（例如，自主驾驶或辅助驾驶中的激光雷达）。在许多情况下，需要传输大量数据，因此需要应用适当的压缩工具来降低分辨率或带宽。本文提出了一种新的解决方案，用于对被大量压缩后的时间变化的3D视频点云进行升采样和恢复。我们的模型由一个专门设计的图卷积网络组成，该网络结合了动态边缘卷积和图注意力网络进行特征聚合，在生成对抗设置中进行。我们展示了一种不依赖于传统体素化操作的密集点云抽样方法，来自PointNet ++ 的启发。我们的实验表明，所提出的方法在4D视频点云上采样方面优于现有的最先进技术，无论是从定量还是定性上都取得了更好的结果。",
