    "abstract": "Spatial processes observed in various fields, such as climate and environmental science, often occur on a large scale and demonstrate spatial nonstationarity. Fitting a Gaussian process with a nonstationary Mat\\'ern covariance is challenging. Previous studies in the literature have tackled this challenge by employing spatial partitioning techniques to estimate the parameters that vary spatially in the covariance function. The selection of partitions is an important consideration, but it is often subjective and lacks a data-driven approach. To address this issue, in this study, we utilize the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) to derive subregions from the nonstationary data. We employ a selection mechanism to identify subregions that exhibit similar behavior to stationary fields. In order to distinguish between stationary and nonstationary random fields, we conducted training on ConvNet using various simulated data. These simulations are generated from Gaussian processes",

    "translated_abstract": "在气候和环境科学等领域观察到的空间过程往往发生在大规模上，并呈现出空间不平稳性。拟合具有非平稳Matern协方差的高斯过程具有挑战性。文献中的先前研究通过采用空间划分技术估计在协方差函数中空间变化的参数来解决这一挑战。划分的选择是一个重要的考虑因素，但往往是主观的，缺乏数据驱动的方法。为了解决这个问题，本研究利用卷积神经网络（ConvNets）的能力从非平稳的数据中派生子区域。我们采用选择机制来识别表现出与稳态场相似行为的子区域。为了区分稳态和非平稳随机场，我们使用各种模拟数据对ConvNet进行训练。这些模拟数据是从高斯过程中生成的。",
