    "translated_abstract": "拥塞博弈是一种强大的模型，涵盖了交通网络和资源分配等一系列工程系统。本文研究拥塞博弈的在线形式，其中代理重复参与博弈，并观察到带有随机性的反馈。我们提出了一种名为CongestEXP的分散算法，应用于经典的指数权重方法，通过在设施级别上保持权重，避免了传统算法对可能设施集大小的指数依赖，即$\\binom{F}{k}\\approx F^k$，并且仅与$F$线性缩放。具体地，我们证明了对于每个单独的玩家，CongestEXP可以实现$O(kF\\sqrt{T})$的遗憾上界，其中$T$是时间周期。另一方面，利用权重的指数增长使CongestEXP能够实现快速收敛到纳什均衡，其收敛速度为$O(\\ln F/\\sqrt{T})$，这与已知的最佳下界相符，仅相差对数因子。我们的分析也适用于更广泛的游戏类别，包括那些具有连续分布权重和那些具有任意玩家行动的游戏。最后，我们在合成数据集和实际数据集上证明了CongestEXP的有效性。",
