Despite its popularity, the robustness of LIC with respect to the quality of image reconstruction remains under-explored. In this paper, we introduce an imperceptible attack approach designed to effectively degrade the reconstruction quality of LIC, resulting in the reconstructed image being severely disrupted by noise where any object in the reconstructed images is virtually impossible. More specifically, we generate adversarial examples by introducing a Frobenius norm-based loss function to maximize the discrepancy between original images and reconstructed adversarial examples. Further, leveraging the insensitivity of high-frequency components to human vision, we introduce Imperceptibility Constraint (IC) to ensure that the perturbations remain inconspicuous. Experiments conducted on the Kodak dataset using various LIC models demonstrate effectiveness. In ",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，学习图像压缩（LIC）因其非凡的性能而成为图像传输的趋势技术。尽管其受欢迎度很高，但是LIC在图像重构质量方面的稳健性仍未得到探索。本文引入一种不可感知攻击方法，旨在有效降低LIC的重构质量，导致重构图像被噪声严重干扰，重构图像中的任何对象都几乎不可能恢复。具体来说，我们通过引入基于Frobenius范数的损失函数来生成对抗样本，以最大化原始图像与重构对抗样本之间的差异。进一步利用高频分量对人眼视觉不敏感的特点，我们引入了不可察觉性约束（IC），以确保扰动保持不显眼。在Kodak数据集上使用各种LIC模型进行的实验证明了其有效性。",
