    "abstract": "This paper describes TOBY, a visualization tool that helps a user explore the contents of an academic survey paper. The visualization consists of four components: a hierarchical view of taxonomic data in the survey, a document similarity view in the space of taxonomic classes, a network view of citations, and a new paper recommendation tool. In this paper, we will discuss these features in the context of three separate deployments of the tool.",
