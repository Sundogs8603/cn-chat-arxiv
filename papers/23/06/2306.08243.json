    "translated_abstract": "自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）是一种发育性疾病，其特征是重大的社交沟通障碍和困难的知觉和表达沟通提示。机器学习技术已广泛应用于促进自闭症研究和评估。然而，计算模型主要集中于特定分析，并在自闭症社区的私有数据集上进行验证，这限制了由于数据共享复杂性而跨模型的比较。本研究提出了一种新的隐私保护开源数据集MMASD作为多模式ASD基准数据集，收集自患有自闭症儿童的游戏治疗干预。MMASD包括32名患有ASD的儿童的数据，以及从100多小时的干预录音中分段的1,315个数据样本。为促进公共访问，每个数据样本包含四种隐私保护模式的数据：（1）光流，（2）2D骨架，（3）3D骨架和（4）临床医生ASD评估。",
