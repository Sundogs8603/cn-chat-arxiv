    "translated_abstract": "结构化知识库是许多知识密集型应用的支柱，并自动构建已受到广泛关注。具体来说，开放信息提取（OpenIE）通常用于从文本中诱导结构。然而，尽管它允许高召回率，但提取出的知识往往会从源和OpenIE算法继承噪声。此外，OpenIE元组包含一组开放的、非规范化的关系，使提取出的知识上下游的利用更加困难。本文研究了将开放的常识知识库映射到现有知识库的固定模式的问题，具体涉及常识知识。我们提议通过生成式翻译方法解决这个问题，即通过训练语言模型从开放的断言中生成固定模式的断言。实验证明，这种方法占据了传统手动、基于规则或基于分类的规范化和仅生成之间的甜点。",
