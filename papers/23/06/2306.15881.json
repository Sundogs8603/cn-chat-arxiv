    "translated_abstract": "特征交互在推荐系统中起着至关重要的作用，因为它们捕捉了用户偏好和物品特征之间的复杂关系。现有方法（如深度和交叉网络 DCNv2）可能由于其跨层操作而面临高计算需求的问题。本文提出了一种新颖的方法，称为块状特征交互 (BFI)，以帮助缓解这个问题。通过将特征交互过程分成较小的块，我们可以显著减少内存占用和计算负担。我们开发了四个变体（分别为 P、Q、T、S）的 BFI，并进行了实证比较。我们的实验结果表明，所提出的算法在与标准 DCNv2 相比时能够实现接近的准确性，同时大大减少了计算开销和参数数量。本文通过提供一种改进推荐系统的实际解决方案，为高效推荐系统的发展做出了贡献。",
