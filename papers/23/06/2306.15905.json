    "translated_abstract": "协同过滤（CF）是一种广泛应用的技术，可以基于过去的互动预测用户的偏好。负采样在使用隐式反馈训练基于CF的模型时起到至关重要的作用。本文提出了一种基于采样区域的新视角来重新审视现有的采样方法。我们指出，目前的采样方法主要集中在点采样或线采样上，缺乏灵活性，并且有相当大一部分困难采样区域未被探索。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一种维度无关的困难负样本混合方法（DINS），它是第一个针对训练基于CF的模型的区域采样方法。DINS包括三个模块：困难边界定义、维度无关混合和多跳池化。在真实世界的数据集上进行的实验证明，DINS优于其他负采样方法，证明了它的有效性和优越性。",
