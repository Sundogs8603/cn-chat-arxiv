    "translated_abstract": "科学机器学习（SciML）近年来在计算科学和工程的许多不同领域取得了进展。其目标是在不需要复杂和计算密集的数据同化方案的情况下，无缝地将数据和物理知识集成起来。然而，预处理、问题建模、代码生成、后处理和分析仍然是耗时的，并且可能限制SciML在工业应用和数字孪生框架中的广泛适用性。在这里，我们将SciML的各个阶段整合到ChatGPT的伞下，形成CrunchGPT，它通过用户简单的提示来协调整个SciML的工作流程。具体而言，我们提供了两个示例，演示了CrunchGPT在气动学中优化机翼和在各种几何形状中获得流场的潜在用途，并强调了验证阶段。为了演示CrunchGPT的流程和",
