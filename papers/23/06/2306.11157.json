    "abstract": "The preservation of soil health has been identified as one of the main challenges of the XXI century given its vast (and potentially threatening) ramifications in agriculture, human health and biodiversity. Here, we provide the first deep investigation of the predictive potential of machine-learning models to understand the connections between soil and biological phenotypes. Indeed, we investigate an integrative framework performing accurate machine-learning-based prediction of plant phenotypes from biological, chemical and physical properties of the soil via two models: random forest and Bayesian neural network. We show that prediction is improved, as evidenced by higher weighted F1 scores, when incorporating into the models environmental features like soil physicochemical properties and microbial population density in addition to the microbiome information. Furthermore, by exploring multiple data preprocessing strategies such as normalization, zero replacement, and data augmentation,",
