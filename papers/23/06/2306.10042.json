    "abstract": "Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) aims to extract the triplet of an aspect term, an opinion term, and their corresponding sentiment polarity from the review texts. Due to the complexity of language and the existence of multiple aspect terms and opinion terms in a single sentence, current models often confuse the connections between an aspect term and the opinion term describing it. To address this issue, we propose a pairing enhancement approach for ASTE, which incorporates contrastive learning during the training stage to inject aspect-opinion pairing knowledge into the triplet extraction model. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs well on four ASTE datasets (i.e., 14lap, 14res, 15res and 16res) compared to several related classical and state-of-the-art triplet extraction methods. Moreover, ablation studies conduct an analysis and verify the advantage of contrastive learning over other pairing enhancement approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction（ASTE）旨在从评论文本中提取一个方面术语、一个意见术语和它们相应的情感极性的三元组。由于语言的复杂性和单个句子中存在多个方面术语和意见术语，当前的模型经常会混淆描述它的方面术语和意见术语之间的联系。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种配对增强方法，它在训练阶段采用对比学习，将方面-意见配对知识注入到三元组提取模型中。实验结果表明，与几种相关经典和最先进的三元组提取方法相比，我们的方法在四个ASTE数据集（即14lap，14res，15res和16res）上表现良好。此外，消融研究进行分析并验证了对比学习相比其他配对增强方法的优势。",
