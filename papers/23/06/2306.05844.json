    "translated_abstract": "随着协作机器人 (cobots) 在工业制造中的应用不断增长，有效的人机协作需要人类行为识别能力的支持。骨架分析方法因其更好地适应不同人和环境而经常被使用。然而，仅处理骨架时，人与物体的交互信息将丢失。因此，本研究提出了一种将物体信息融入基于骨架的人类行为识别的新方法。本文通过将物体中心视为进一步的骨架关节，增强了两种先进方法。我们的实验使用了一个先进的实例分割模型对骨架关节与物体的预测进行了组合，结果表明，我们的方法大大改善了这些先进方法在装配数据集IKEA ASM上的性能。本研究为在工业制造中实现有效的人机协作以及骨架检测添加物体信息的好处提供了新思路。",
