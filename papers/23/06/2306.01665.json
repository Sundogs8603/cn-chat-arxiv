    "translated_abstract": "随着区块链技术越来越流行，典型的金融骗局庞兹骗局也在区块链平台以太坊上出现。通过智能合约部署的这种庞兹骗局，也称为智能庞兹骗局，已经造成了大量的经济损失和负面影响。现有的以太坊智能庞兹骗局检测方法主要依赖于智能合约的字节码特征、操作码特征、账户特征和交易行为特征，这些方法缺乏可解释性和可持续性。本文提出了SourceP，一种使用预训练模型和数据流在以太坊平台上检测智能庞兹骗局的方法。该方法只需要利用智能合约的源代码作为特征，从另一个角度探索检测智能庞兹骗局的可能性。SourceP降低了现有检测方法的数据获取和特征提取难度，同时增加了模型的可解释性。",
