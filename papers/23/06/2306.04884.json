    "translated_abstract": "图聚类是网络分析中的基本任务之一，其目标是检测与彼此连接紧密、但与其余图稀疏连接的节点集。本文提出了一种更快的逼近算法，应用于一个名为LambdaCC的NP困难参数化聚类框架，该框架由可调节的分辨率参数控制，并且概括了许多其他聚类目标，例如模块化、最稀疏割和聚类删除。以前的LambdaCC算法要么是没有逼近保证的启发式算法，要么是计算复杂的逼近算法。我们提出了可以纯粹利用组合方法实现的快速新逼近算法。这些算法基于我们介绍的新参数化边标记问题，这个问题概括了之前基于强三元闭合原理的边标记问题，并在社交网络分析中有着独立的重要性。我们的方法比以前的逼近算法可扩展性高几个数量级。",
