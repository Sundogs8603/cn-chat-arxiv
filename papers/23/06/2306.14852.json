    "translated_abstract": "分子构象生成是化学信息学和药物发现中的重要任务。能够高效生成低能量的三维结构可以避免昂贵的量子力学模拟，从而加速虚拟筛选和增强结构探索。已经开发了多种用于分子构象生成的生成模型，但很多模型难以持续产生高质量的构象。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了CoarsenConf，它基于扭转角度进行分子图的粗化，并将其整合到SE(3)-等变分层变分自动编码器中。通过等变的粗化，我们聚合了通过可转动键连接的子图的细粒度原子坐标，创建了一个可变长度的粗粒度潜在表示。我们的模型使用一种新颖的聚合注意机制，从粗粒度的潜在表示中恢复细粒度的坐标，实现了高效准确的构象生成。",
