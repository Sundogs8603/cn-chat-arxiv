    "translated_abstract": "在多智能体系统中，设计能够与其他代理有效交互而无需事先协调的自主代理是一个核心问题。基于类型的推理方法通过维护对其他代理的一组潜在行为信念来实现这一目标。然而，当前的方法存在一定局限性，它们认为其他代理的状态和行动是完全可观测的，或者在处理更大的问题和更长的计划时缺乏高效性。我们提出了部分可观测类型的元蒙特卡罗规划(POTMMCP)，这是一种基于在线蒙特卡罗树搜索的类型推理大规模部分可观测环境规划方法。POTMMCP结合了一种新颖的元策略来指导搜索和评估信念，使其能够以更少的规划时间更有效地搜索更长的时间间隔。我们展示了我们的方法在极限状态下收敛到最优解，并通过实验证明它能够有效适应。",
