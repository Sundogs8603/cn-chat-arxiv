    "abstract": "In this paper we propose RecFusion, which comprise a set of diffusion models for recommendation. Unlike image data which contain spatial correlations, a user-item interaction matrix, commonly utilized in recommendation, lacks spatial relationships between users and items. We formulate diffusion on a 1D vector and propose binomial diffusion, which explicitly models binary user-item interactions with a Bernoulli process. We show that RecFusion approaches the performance of complex VAE baselines on the core recommendation setting (top-n recommendation for binary non-sequential feedback) and the most common datasets (MovieLens and Netflix). Our proposed diffusion models that are specialized for 1D and/or binary setups have implications beyond recommendation systems, such as in the medical domain with MRI and CT scans.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了RecFusion，这是一组用于推荐的扩散模型。不同于包含空间相关性的图像数据，常用于推荐的用户-项目交互矩阵缺乏用户和项目之间的空间关系。我们在一个一维向量上制定了扩散方法，并提出了二项式扩散，这个方法利用了伯努利过程显式地对二元用户-项目交互进行建模。我们展示了RecFusion在核心推荐设置（针对二进制非顺序反馈的前n项推荐）和最常见的数据集（MovieLens和Netflix）上接近于复杂的VAE基线的表现。我们提出的专门针对1D和/或二进制设置的扩散模型的意义超出了推荐系统，例如在医学领域中使用MRI和CT扫描。",
