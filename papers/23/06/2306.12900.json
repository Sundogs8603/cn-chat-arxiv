    "translated_abstract": "近年来，机器学习在促进流体动力学计算方面有许多成功的应用。随着模拟的增长，为传统的离线学习生成新的训练数据集会造成I/O和存储瓶颈。此外，在运行时执行推理需要将ML框架库与模拟代码进行非平凡的耦合。本文通过简化这种耦合并在异构集群上启用原位训练和推理工作流程来解决这两个限制。利用SmartSim，所提出的框架部署了一个数据库将数据和ML模型存储在内存中，从而避免了文件系统问题。在Polaris超级计算机上，我们展示了将数据库部署在新位置从而取得成倍增长的数据传输和推断成本的完美扩展效率。此外，我们从湍流流动模拟中实时研究了自动编码器的训练，显示出框架开销相对于传统方法的可忽略性。",
