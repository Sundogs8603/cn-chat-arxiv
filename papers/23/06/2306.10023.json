    "abstract": "This study presents a theoretical analysis on the efficiency of interleaving, an efficient online evaluation method for rankings. Although interleaving has already been applied to production systems, the source of its high efficiency has not been clarified in the literature. Therefore, this study presents a theoretical analysis on the efficiency of interleaving methods. We begin by designing a simple interleaving method similar to ordinary interleaving methods. Then, we explore a condition under which the interleaving method is more efficient than A/B testing and find that this is the case when users leave the ranking depending on the item's relevance, a typical assumption made in click models. Finally, we perform experiments based on numerical analysis and user simulation, demonstrating that the theoretical results are consistent with the empirical results.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究针对一种用于排名的高效在线评估方法——交错比较，进行了效率的理论分析。虽然交错比较已经应用于实际系统中，但其高效率的源头在文献中尚未得到明确的阐述。因此，本研究设计了一个类似于普通交错比较方法的简单交错比较方法，并探索了一种条件，该条件下交错比较方法比A/B测试更有效。其中的条件是，当用户根据物品的相关性来离开排名时（这是点击模型中的一个典型假设），这种情况就会出现。最后，我们还基于数值分析和用户模拟进行实验，证明了理论结果与实证结果是一致的。",
