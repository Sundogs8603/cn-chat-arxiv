    "abstract": "Discovering evolutionary traits that are heritable across species on the tree of life (also referred to as a phylogenetic tree) is of great interest to biologists to understand how organisms diversify and evolve. However, the measurement of traits is often a subjective and labor-intensive process, making trait discovery a highly label-scarce problem. We present a novel approach for discovering evolutionary traits directly from images without relying on trait labels. Our proposed approach, Phylo-NN, encodes the image of an organism into a sequence of quantized feature vectors -- or codes -- where different segments of the sequence capture evolutionary signals at varying ancestry levels in the phylogeny. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing biologically meaningful results in a number of downstream tasks including species image generation and species-to-species image translation, using fish species as a target example.",

    "translated_abstract": "发现沿生命之树（也称为进化树）跨物种遗传的进化特征对生物学家理解生物多样性和进化模式具有极大的兴趣。然而，特征的测量通常是一个主观和耗时的过程，使得特征发现成为一个高度稀缺标签的问题。本文提出了一种新的方法，可以直接从没有特征标签的图像中发现进化特征。我们提出的方法 Phylo-NN，将一个生物体的图像编码成一系列量化的特征向量序列，其中序列的不同段在进化树的不同祖先层次捕获进化信号。我们使用鱼类物种作为目标示例，在许多下游任务中展示了我们的方法在产生生物学上有意义的结果中的有效性，包括物种图像生成和物种到物种的图像翻译。",
