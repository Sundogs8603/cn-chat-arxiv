    "translated_abstract": "临床和流动场景中的定期血压（BP）监测在预防、诊断、治疗和管理心血管疾病中起着至关重要的作用。最近，流动式BP测量设备的广泛采用主要是由于高血压的普遍增加以及其相关风险和临床状况。最近的指南建议将定期BP监测作为常规临床访视甚至在家里进行。 这种增加的BP测量技术利用带式测压方法也带来了重要的关注点，涉及各种设置下报告的BP值的准确性。在这项综述中，我们重点介绍了基于带式测压技术的BP测量方法如何由于测量和设备误差、人口统计学数据和体型差异等因素导致显著偏差和方差。在这些固有的偏差情况下，发展一种新一代的基于带式测压设备，其使用人工智能技术来纠正误差是非常重要的。",
