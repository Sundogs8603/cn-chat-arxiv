    "translated_abstract": "准确的城市时空预测对智慧城市的发展和运营至关重要。作为新兴的构建模块，多源城市数据通常被整合为城市知识图谱（UrbanKG），为城市时空预测模型提供关键知识。然而，现有的UrbanKG通常为特定的下游预测任务量身定制，且不公开可用，限制了潜在的进展。本文介绍了UUKG，一种统一的城市知识图谱数据集，用于增强知识的城市时空预测。具体而言，我们首先构建了包含数百万个三元组的UrbanKG，连接了城市中的异构实体，如行政区、兴趣点和道路段。此外，我们对构建的UrbanKG进行了定性和定量分析，揭示了各种高阶结构模式，如层次结构和循环，可以用来提高预测性能。",
