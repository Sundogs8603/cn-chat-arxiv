    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新颖的方法，通过将专家知识与大型语言模型（LLMs）相结合，自动分析企业可持续性报告，并将其与《气候相关金融披露任务组》（TCFD）建议进行基准对比。企业可持续性报告对于评估组织的环境和社会风险和影响至关重要。然而，分析这些报告中大量的信息往往会导致人力成本过高。因此，全球只有少数机构有资源来分析这些报告，这可能导致缺乏透明度。虽然AI驱动的工具可以自动分析数据，但由于缺乏领域专业知识，它们容易出现不准确性。本文介绍了一种新颖的方法，以增强LLMs的专业知识，自动分析企业可持续性报告。我们将其命名为CHATREPORT工具，并在第一个应用案例中将其应用于评估企业的气候风险披露。",
