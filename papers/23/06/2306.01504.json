One way of framing these impulses of solidarity would be to be able to list in real-time the citizens/volunteers available with their vehicles (land, sea, air, etc.), to be able to geolocate them according to the risk areas to be evacuated, and adding them to the evacuation/rescue vehicles. Because it is difficult to propose an effective real-time operational system on the field in a real crisis situation, in this work, we propose to add a module for recommending driver/vehicle pairs (with their specificities) to a system of crisis management simulation. To do that, we chose to model and develop an ontology-supported constraint-based recommender system for crisis management simulations.",
