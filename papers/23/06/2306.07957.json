    "abstract": "End-to-end driving systems have recently made rapid progress, in particular on CARLA. Independent of their major contribution, they introduce changes to minor system components. Consequently, the source of improvements is unclear. We identify two biases that recur in nearly all state-of-the-art methods and are critical for the observed progress on CARLA: (1) lateral recovery via a strong inductive bias towards target point following, and (2) longitudinal averaging of multimodal waypoint predictions for slowing down. We investigate the drawbacks of these biases and identify principled alternatives. By incorporating our insights, we develop TF++, a simple end-to-end method that ranks first on the Longest6 and LAV benchmarks, gaining 14 driving score over the best prior work on Longest6.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，端到端的驾驶系统在CARLA测试中取得了快速进展。然而，即使在主要贡献的基础上，这些系统也会引入对次要系统组件的改变。因此，系统的改进源并不清楚。我们发现，在几乎所有最先进的方法中都存在两种偏见，这些偏见对于在CARLA上观察到的进展至关重要：(1) 通过对目标点跟随的强归纳偏见来进行横向恢复，(2) 通过多模态航路点预测的纵向平均来减速。我们研究了这些偏见的缺点，并确定了合理的替代方法。通过结合我们的见解，我们开发了TF ++，一种简单的端到端方法，在Longest6和LAV基准测试中排名第一，在Longest6上比最佳前期工作提高了14个驾驶分数。",
