    "translated_abstract": "本研究聚焦于开发和实施一个综合的数字时间序列预测模型集合，统称为数字时间序列预测模型组（G-NM）。该集合包括传统模型如自回归综合移动平均（ARIMA）、Holt-Winters方法和支持向量回归（SVR），以及现代神经网络模型，如循环神经网络（RNN）和长短期记忆（LSTM）。G-NM明确构建以增强我们对复杂自然现象中固有模式和趋势的预测能力。通过利用与这些事件相关的时间序列数据，G-NM便于对此类现象在延长时间段内进行预测。本研究的主要目标是推进我们对此类事件的理解，并大幅提高预测准确性。G-NM包括线性和非线性依赖关系，以及季节性趋势。",
