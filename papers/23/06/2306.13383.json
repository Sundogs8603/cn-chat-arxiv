    "translated_abstract": "除非控制所选最优解的选择概率，否则使用整数线性规划无法做出真正公平的决策。为此，我们提出了一个统一的框架，当二元决策变量代表具有二元偏好的代理时，他们只关心是否在最终解中被选中。我们开发了几种通用的算法来公平地选择最优解，例如通过最大化纳什乘积或最小选择概率，或使用代理人的随机排序作为选择标准（随机串行独裁）。因此，我们将解决整数线性规划的黑盒子程序嵌入了一个从头到尾都可以解释的框架中。此外，我们将我们的框架嵌入到合作谈判和概率社会选择的丰富文献中来研究所提出的方法的公理特性。最后，我们对特定应用中的提出的方法进行了评估。",

The proposed methods embed the black-box procedure of solving an integer linear program into an explainable framework and also study their axiomatic properties by embedding them into cooperative bargaining and probabilistic social choice. The paper evaluates these methods on a specific application, thus solving the problem of making truly fair decisions using integer linear programs."
