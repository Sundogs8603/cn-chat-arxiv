    "abstract": "Recent animal studies have shown that biological brains can enter a low power mode in times of food scarcity. This paper explores the possibility of applying similar mechanisms to a broad class of neuromorphic systems where power consumption is strongly dependent on the magnitude of synaptic weights. In particular, we show through mathematical models and simulations that careful scaling of synaptic weights can significantly reduce power consumption (by over 80\\% in some of the cases tested) while having a relatively small impact on accuracy. These results uncover an exciting opportunity to design neuromorphic systems for edge AI applications, where power consumption can be dynamically adjusted based on energy availability and performance requirements.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的动物实验已经显示出生物大脑在食物匮乏时可以进入低功耗模式。本文探讨了将类似机制应用于一类强烈依赖于突触权值大小的神经形态系统中的可能性。具体而言，我们通过数学模型和仿真表明，仔细缩放突触权值可以显著减少功耗（在某些情况下可降低80％以上），同时对准确性影响较小。这些结果揭示了一种令人兴奋的机会，即设计用于边缘人工智能应用的神经形态系统，其中功耗可以根据能量供应和性能要求进行动态调整。",
