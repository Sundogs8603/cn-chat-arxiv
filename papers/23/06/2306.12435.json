    "translated_abstract": "强迫症是一种高度令人痛苦的疾病，其常常与前额皮层和代谢型谷氨酸受体5(mGluR5)有关。研究发现，通过测量小鼠正电子发射断层扫描的分布容积比，发现该受体信号水平更高。然而，由于需要更多实证数据，尚无法完全验证mGluR5的参与。因此，本研究使用计算建模方法，利用患有精神分裂症、抑郁症和强迫症患者的T1静息态磁共振成像(TRS-MRI)扫描，以回答有关OCD的因果因素的不足。通过这些疾病之间的交叉比较，寻找特定疾病的显著特征。本研究开发了一个卷积神经网络模型，用于识别区分患有OCD和其他精神障碍的生物标志物。结果表明，该模型可以高精度地识别患有OCD 的患者，准确率超过90%。这种方法可以作为一种有效的诊断OCD的工具，为传统诊断流程提供可靠的替代方案。",
