    "translated_abstract": "对于车载虚拟现实，优化从车上用户的沉浸式体验和服务质量是最终目标之一。语义通信（SemCom）被引入为一种革命性范例，可以显著缓解车载虚拟现实应用程序的通信资源压力，从而实现该目标。SemCom实现了高质量和超高效的车载通信，甚至在车辆之间的数据流量飞速增长时仍能如此。在本文中，我们提出了一个层级式SemCom实现的车载虚拟现实框架，包括全局虚拟现实、本地虚拟现实、SemCom模块和资源池。从分布角度考虑用户的服务质量，本文探讨了该框架的潜在安全漏洞。为了达到这个目的，本研究强调了该框架的SemCom模块的特定安全风险，并提供了一种可行的防御方法。",
