    "translated_abstract": "彩色多普勒心脏超声是一种广泛使用的非侵入性成像技术，可以提供关于心脏血流的实时信息。在左心室长轴视图中，彩色多普勒容易出现相位包裹现象，特别是在心脏收缩和舒张期。当基于彩色多普勒的定量方法时，必须纠正这种包裹伪影。我们开发了一个基于展开型原始-对偶网络的方法来解包(去伪影)彩色多普勒心脏超声图像，将其有效性与基于nnU-Net和Transformer模型的两种最新分割方法进行了比较。我们在自有数据集上对每种方法进行了训练和评估，并发现nnU-Net方法提供了最佳的去伪影结果，其次是展开型原始-对偶方法和基于Transformer的技术。值得注意的是，展开型原始-对偶网络拥有显著更少的可训练参数，但性能仍能与其他方法相媲美。",
