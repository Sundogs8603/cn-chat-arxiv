    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了ArrayBot，这是一个由16×16的竖向滑动柱和触觉传感器组成的分布式操作系统，可以同时支持、感知和操作桌面上的物体。为了实现通用分布式操作，我们利用强化学习算法自动发现控制策略。面对大量冗余的动作，我们提出考虑空间局部动作图块和频域中低频动作来重新定义动作空间。通过这个重新定义的动作空间，我们训练强化学习代理，只通过触觉观察即可重新定位不同的物体。令人惊讶的是，我们发现发现的策略不仅可以推广到模拟器中看不见的物体形状，而且可以在物理机器人上进行转移而不需要任何域随机化。利用部署的策略，我们展示了丰富的真实世界操作任务，展示了其巨大潜力。",
