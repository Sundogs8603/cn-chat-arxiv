    "abstract": "In this paper, we report on three experiments we have carried out in the context of the EMPATHY project, with the aim of helping users make better configuration choices in a smart home environment, and discuss our results. We found that there are psychological traits, such as Need for Cognition, which influence the way individuals tend to use recommendations, that there are non obvious relationships between the perceived usefulness of recommendations in different domains and individuals' ability to exploit suggestions on configuration choices, and that detailed, easy-to-understand security explanations are more persuasive than simple security warnings, when it comes to make decisions on the applicability of rules which might cause privacy and security risks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文报告了 EMPATHY 项目中进行的三项实验，旨在帮助用户在智能家居环境中做出更好的配置选择，并讨论了我们的结果。我们发现，存在心理特征，例如认知需求，影响个体使用建议的方式；在不同领域中，对建议的感知有着非显而易见的关系，个体利用建议进行配置选择的能力因人而异；对于可能引起隐私和安全风险的规则的适用性决策，详细易懂的安全说明比简单的安全警告更具有说服力。",
