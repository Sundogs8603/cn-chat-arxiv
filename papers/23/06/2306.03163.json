    "translated_abstract": "在云端或专用硬件上训练深度学习模型是昂贵的。一种更具成本效益的选择是提供点实例的高超规模云，这是一个便宜但短暂的选择，用于替代按需资源。由于点实例的可用性可能会因日期、大陆和云供应商不同而发生变化，因此在全球范围内分配资源可能更具成本效益。但是，尚未调查地理分布式数据并行点深度学习训练是否是集中式训练的更具成本效益的替代方案。本文旨在回答一个问题：深度学习模型能否在覆盖不同数据中心和云提供商的点 VM 全球市场上以更具成本效益的方式进行训练？为了提供指导，我们广泛评估了不同区域、大陆和云对代表性 CV 和 NLP 模型的成本和吞吐量影响。为了进一步扩展当前的培训选择，我们比较了可扩展性潜力。",
