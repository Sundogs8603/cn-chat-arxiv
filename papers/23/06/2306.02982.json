    "abstract": "We propose PolyVoice, a language model-based framework for speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system. Our framework consists of two language models: a translation language model and a speech synthesis language model. We use discretized speech units, which are generated in a fully unsupervised way, and thus our framework can be used for unwritten languages. For the speech synthesis part, we adopt the existing VALL-E X approach and build a unit-based audio language model. This grants our framework the ability to preserve the voice characteristics and the speaking style of the original speech. We examine our system on Chinese $\\rightarrow$ English and English $\\rightarrow$ Spanish pairs. Experimental results show that our system can generate speech with high translation quality and audio quality. Speech samples are available at https://speechtranslation.github.io/polyvoice.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了PolyVoice，一个基于语言模型的语音到语音翻译系统框架。我们的框架包括两个语言模型：翻译语言模型和语音合成语言模型。我们使用经过离散化的语音单元，这些单元完全以无监督的方式生成，因此我们的框架可以用于非书面语言。对于语音合成部分，我们采用现有的VALL-E X方法，并构建了一个基于单元的音频语言模型。这赋予了我们的框架保留原始语音的声音特征和说话风格的能力。我们在中文 $\\rightarrow$ 英文和英文 $\\rightarrow$ 西班牙语对上测试了我们的系统。实验结果表明，我们的系统可以生成高质量的翻译和音频质量的语音。语音样本可在https://speechtranslation.github.io/polyvoice上获取。",
