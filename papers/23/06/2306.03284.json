Crucially, during training we use a single-step reconstruction based on the posterior mean estimate given by the diffusion model and the MRI measurement process. Experiments across varying anatomies, acceleration factors, and pattern types show that sampling operators learned with our method lead to competitive, and in the case of 2D patterns, improved reconstructions compared to baseline patterns. Our method requires as few as five training images to learn effective sampling patterns.",
