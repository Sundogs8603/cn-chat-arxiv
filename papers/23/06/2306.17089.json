    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）已成功应用于许多自然语言任务和应用，包括文本生成和人工智能聊天机器人。它们也是概念导向深度学习（CODL）的一种有前景的新技术。然而，前提是LLMs要理解概念并确保概念一致性。本文讨论了这些问题，以及LLMs在CODL中的主要用途，包括从文本中提取概念、从文本中提取概念图和概念学习。人类知识包括符号（概念性）知识和具体（感性）知识。而仅文本的LLMs只能表示符号（概念性）知识。另一方面，多模态LLMs能够表示人类知识的完整范围（概念性和感性）。我们讨论了视觉-语言LLMs中的概念理解，这是最重要的多模态LLMs，并介绍了它们在CODL中的主要用途，包括从图像中提取概念、从图像中提取概念图。",
