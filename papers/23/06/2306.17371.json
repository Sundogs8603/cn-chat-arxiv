    "translated_abstract": "对于神经学疾病和疾病，人脑的功能和解剖连接组可以用于更好地指导有针对性的干预和治疗策略。功能磁共振成像（fMRI）是一种非侵入性的神经成像技术，可以通过时间内的血流来捕捉脑功能的时空特征。fMRI可以通过功能连接矩阵来研究功能连接组，即fMRI图像中感兴趣区域的时间序列之间的Pearson相关系数矩阵。分析功能连接的一种方法是使用偏最小二乘法（PLS），一种针对高维预测变量的多元回归技术。然而，使用PLS分析功能连接忽略了功能连接矩阵的一个重要属性，即这些矩阵是正定的。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了Riemannian流形上的PLS的推广，称为R-PLS，并将其应用于对称正定的连接矩阵。",
