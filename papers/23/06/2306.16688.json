    "translated_abstract": "强化学习（RL）任务的不断复杂化要求分布式RL系统可以高效地生成和处理大量数据以训练智能Agent。然而，现有的开源库存在各种限制，阻碍了它们在需要大规模训练的挑战性场景中的实际应用。虽然OpenAI和DeepMind的工业系统已经成功实现了大规模RL训练，但是它们的系统架构和实现细节对社区来说仍然不公开。在本文中，我们提出了RL训练数据流的新抽象，将各种应用中的实际RL训练统一成一个通用框架，并实现了精细优化。根据这个抽象，我们开发了一个可扩展、高效、可扩展的分布式RL系统，名为\"ReaLly Scalable RL（SRL）\"。",
