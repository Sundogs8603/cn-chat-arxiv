    "abstract": "Turbulent flows are well known to be chaotic and hard to predict; however, their dynamics differ between two and three dimensions. While 2D turbulence tends to form large, coherent structures, in three dimensions vortices cascade to smaller and smaller scales. This cascade creates many fast-changing, small-scale structures and amplifies the unpredictability, making regression-based methods infeasible. We propose the first generative model for forced turbulence in arbitrary 3D geometries and introduce a sample quality metric for turbulent flows based on the Wasserstein distance of the generated velocity-vorticity distribution. In several experiments, we show that our generative diffusion model circumvents the unpredictability of turbulent flows and produces high-quality samples based solely on geometric information. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model beats an industrial-grade numerical solver in the time to generate a turbulent flow field from scratch by an order of magnitude.",

    "translated_abstract": "湍流流动通常难以预测，但二维和三维的湍流流动性质不同。在二维情况下，湍流会形成大的、连续的结构，而在三维情况下，旋涡级联成越来越小的尺度，形成许多快速变化的小尺度结构，加剧了不可预测性，难以使用回归方法。本文提出了第一个生成模型，可以在任意三维空间中模拟湍流现象，并引入了一种基于Wasserstein距离的流场质量度量方法。在多个实验中，我们证明了我们的生成扩散模型可以避免湍流流动的不可预测性，并且可以只依靠几何信息生成高质量的样本。此外，我们还展示了我们的模型可以比工业级数值求解器更快地生成湍流流场。",
