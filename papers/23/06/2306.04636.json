    "translated_abstract": "近年来深度学习的快速发展见证了许多成功的无监督图像到图像转换模型，它们能够在没有成对数据的情况下学习两个视觉领域之间的对应关系。然而，构建各种领域之间的强大映射仍然是一个巨大的挑战，特别是对于那些视觉差异巨大的领域。在本文中，我们介绍了一种新的多功能框架，即生成先验引导下的无监督图像到图像翻译（GP-UNIT），它提高了现有转换模型的质量、适用性和可控性。 GP-UNIT 的关键思想是从预先训练的类别条件 GAN 中提炼生成先验，以构建粗略级别的跨域对应关系，并将学习到的先验应用于对抗性转换，以挖掘细节级别的对应关系。通过学习到的多级内容对应关系，GP-UNIT 能够在接近的领域和远离的领域之间执行有效的翻译。对于接近的领域，GP-UNIT 可以进行有条件的翻译。",
