    "translated_abstract": "深度强化学习在许多领域中已被证明可以产生出具有能力的代理和控制策略，但常常受到训练时间过长的困扰。此外，在连续控制问题的情况下，现有深度学习库的实时性和可移植性的缺乏限制了学习策略在实际嵌入式设备上的应用。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了BackpropTools，一种依赖性-free、header-only、pure C++的深度监督和强化学习库。利用最近C++标准的模板元编程能力，我们提供了可以由编译器紧密集成的可组合组件。其新颖的架构允许BackpropTools在异构平台集合上无缝使用，从HPC集群、工作站和笔记本电脑到智能手机、智能手表和微控制器。具体来说，由于RL算法与模拟环境的紧密集成，BackpropTools在连续控制问题的深度RL代理的高效可扩展训练方面具有优势。此外，它的可移植性和实时保证使其成为在嵌入式设备上部署学来的策略的有价值的工具。",
