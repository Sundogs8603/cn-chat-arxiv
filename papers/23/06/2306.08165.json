    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了应用机器学习技术预测僵尸企业的方法。我们通过对意大利2008年到2017年304906家公司的公开财务信息和非随机缺失数据训练和测试算法来得出风险分析。然后，我们根据预测结果中高于某个阈值的最高经济困难，最小化误报率和漏报率的组合。我们将在至少连续三年中，落入高风险分类中的企业视作“僵尸企业”，即处于财务困境的企业。为此，我们实现了一种梯度提升算法(XGBoost)，利用了丢失数据的信息。将缺失数据包含在预测模型中是至关重要的，因为未披露账户的模式与公司破产相关。最后，我们通过展示僵尸企业在长期内表现出低利润率、低生产率和低投资水平来验证我们的方法，这表明我们的发现对经济政策具有重要意义。",
