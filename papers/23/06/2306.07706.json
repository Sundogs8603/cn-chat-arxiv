    "translated_abstract": "多标准决策分析（MCDA）在各个行业中广泛用于评估和排名备选方案。在众多MCDA方法中，TOPSIS仍然是许多应用领域最受欢迎的选择之一。TOPSIS计算考虑的备选方案与两个预定义方案（即理想状态和反理想状态）之间的距离，并根据这些距离的聚合值创建备选方案的排名。然而，TOPSIS的内部工作解释是困难的，特别是当标准数目很大时。为此，最近的研究表明可以使用备选方案的平均值（M）和标准偏差（SD）来表示TOPSIS聚合值，从而创建MSD空间，这是一种可视化并解释聚合的工具。即使MSD空間非常有用，但它假设标准同样重要，使其在实际排名问题中的适用性降低 。在本文中，我们推广了 TOPSIS 结果的转换，使得不同的标准可以解释为视觉上的 MSD 空间，以此来处理将权重加入TOPSIS问题的场景。我们引入了加权 MSD 空间并开发了一个决策支持工具，称为 TOPSIS-Explorer，提供易于理解的视觉洞察力，以分析不同权重和聚合值对排名结果的影响。我们的方法在合成数据集和供应商选择实际案例上进行了评估，证明了它在提供可解释TOPSIS结果方面的适用性和有效性。",
