    "abstract": "I use matched employer-employee records merged with corporate tax information from 2003 to 2017 to estimate labor market-wide effects of mergers and acquisitions in Brazil. Labor markets are defined by pairs of commuting zone and industry sector. In the following year of a merger, market size falls by 10.8%. The employment adjustment is concentrated in merging firms. For the firms not involved in M&As, I estimate a 1.07% decline in workers earnings and a positive, although not significant, increase in their size. Most mergers have a predicted impact of zero points in concentration, measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). I spillover firms, earnings decline similarly for mergers with high and low predicted changes in HHI. Contrary to the recent literature on market concentration in developed economies, I find no evidence of oligopsonistic behavior in Brazilian labor markets.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文利用2003年至2017年期间匹配的雇主-员工记录和企业税务信息，估计了巴西并购对整个劳动市场的影响。将劳动市场定义为通勤区和行业部门的组合。并购的下一年，市场规模下降了10.8%。雇佣调整集中在合并企业中。对于未涉及并购的企业，我估计工人收入下降了1.07％，但规模呈正增长趋势，尽管没有显著增长。大多数并购对于市场占有度的变化没有预测影响，以哈夫曼-赫希曼指数（HHI）为衡量标准。对于附带效应的企业来说，与HHI变化显著性相比，收入下降情况相似。与发达经济体市场占有度最近的文献相反，在巴西劳动市场没有寡头垄断行为的证据。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study examines the effects of mergers and acquisitions on the labor market in Brazil using matched employer-employee records and corporate tax information from 2003 to 2017. The study found that mergers lead to a decrease in market size, with employment adjustment focused on the merging firms. Non-merging firms experience a decline in worker earnings and a positive but insignificant increase in size. Most mergers have no predicted impact on market concentration, and no evidence of oligopsonistic behavior was found in the Brazilian labor market."
