Since the resulting optimization problem is not convex, we make use of recent theoretical results on Normalized Gradient Descent (NGD) for quasiconvex optimization, to eventually derive an Online Normalized Gradient Descent algorithm.

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一个新的框架，其中连续但有界的随机变量具有随时间变化的未观测边界。在单变量时间序列的背景下，我们将这些边界视为有界随机变量分布的参数。我们引入了扩展的对数似然估计，并设计了算法来通过在线最大似然估计来跟踪边界。由于得到的优化问题不是凸的，我们利用了最近关于准凸优化的归一化梯度下降（NGD）的理论结果，最终得到了一种在线归一化梯度下降算法。我们基于模拟研究和一个真实的风力发电预测问题来说明和讨论我们方法的工作原理。",
