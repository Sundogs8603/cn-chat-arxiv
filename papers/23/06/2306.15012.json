    "translated_abstract": "当只对给定信号的特定属性感兴趣时，从一个加性混合物中分离信号可能是一个不必要地困难的问题。在本工作中，我们解决了更简单的“统计分量分离”问题，该问题专注于从噪声混合物中恢复目标信号的预定义统计描述量。假设可以获得噪声过程的样本，我们研究了一种方法，该方法旨在使受噪声样本污染的解决方案候选的统计特性与观测的混合物的统计特性匹配。首先，我们使用具有解析可追踪计算的简单示例分析了该方法的行为。然后，我们将其应用于图像降噪环境中，使用了1）基于小波的描述符，2）针对天体物理和ImageNet数据的ConvNet-based描述符。在第一种情况下，我们展示了我们的方法在大多数情况下比标准降噪方法更好地恢复了目标数据的描述符。此外，尽管不是为此目的构建的，它也表现出对目标信号描述符恢复的潜力。",
