    "abstract": "Many modern applications use computer vision to detect and count objects in massive image collections. However, when the detection task is very difficult or in the presence of domain shifts, the counts may be inaccurate even with significant investments in training data and model development. We propose DISCount -- a detector-based importance sampling framework for counting in large image collections that integrates an imperfect detector with human-in-the-loop screening to produce unbiased estimates of counts. We propose techniques for solving counting problems over multiple spatial or temporal regions using a small number of screened samples and estimate confidence intervals. This enables end-users to stop screening when estimates are sufficiently accurate, which is often the goal in a scientific study. On the technical side we develop variance reduction techniques based on control variates and prove the (conditional) unbiasedness of the estimators. DISCount leads to a 9-12x reduction",

    "translated_abstract": "许多现代应用程序使用计算机视觉在海量图像集合中检测和计数对象。然而，当检测任务非常困难或存在领域转移时，即使投入了大量的培训数据和模型开发，计数结果也可能不准确。我们提出了DISCount——一种基于检测器重要性采样框架的大规模图像计数方法，将一个不完美的检测器与人工筛选相结合，产生无偏估计的计数。我们提出了解决多个空间或时间区域计数问题的技术，只需使用少量的筛选样本并估计置信区间。这使得最终用户在估计足够准确时可以停止筛选，这通常是科学研究的目标。在技术方面，我们开发了基于控制变量的方差缩减技术，并证明了估计器的（条件）无偏性。DISCount导致了9-12倍的降低计数误差。",
