    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界中开发和测试自动驾驶模型可能是具有挑战性甚至危险的，而模拟可以帮助解决这个问题，尤其是对于具有挑战性的驾驶操作。深度强化学习（DRL）通过学习和与环境交互来处理复杂的决策和控制任务，因此非常适合开发自动驾驶，在这方面的具体研究还不多。本研究在highway-env模拟平台上实施、评估和比较了两个DRL算法，Deep Q-networks（DQN）和Trust Region Policy Optimization（TRPO），以培训自动驾驶。同时开发了有效且定制的奖励函数，并通过准确度（车辆在道路上的行驶情况）、效率（车辆的行驶速度）、安全性（车辆避免与障碍物碰撞的可能性）和舒适度（车辆驾驶的舒适程度）来评估已实施的算法。",
