    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel design of the system aimed at supporting the Wikipedia community in addressing vandalism on the platform. To achieve this, we collected a massive dataset of 47 languages, and applied advanced filtering and feature engineering techniques, including multilingual masked language modeling to build the training dataset from human-generated data. The performance of the system was evaluated through comparison with the one used in production in Wikipedia, known as ORES. Our research results in a significant increase in the number of languages covered, making Wikipedia patrolling more efficient to a wider range of communities. Furthermore, our model outperforms ORES, ensuring that the results provided are not only more accurate but also less biased against certain groups of contributors.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一个新颖的系统设计，旨在支持维基百科社区解决平台上的破坏问题。为了实现这一目标，我们收集了47种语言的大规模数据集，并应用了先进的过滤和特征工程技术，包括多语言掩码语言建模，从人生成的数据构建训练数据集。通过与维基百科生产中使用的称为ORES的系统进行比较，我们评估了系统的性能。我们的研究结果显著增加了覆盖语言的数量，使维基百科的巡逻更有效地服务于更广泛的社区。此外，我们的模型表现优于ORES，确保提供的结果不仅更准确，而且也不会对某些贡献者群体产生偏见。",
    "tldr": "本文介绍了一种支持多语言维基百科破坏检测的新型系统设计，经过评估发现其覆盖了更多的语言，效率更高，并且比维基百科中生产使用的ORES系统更加准确和公正。",
