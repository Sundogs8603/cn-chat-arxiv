    "abstract": "We develop a principled approach to end-to-end learning in stochastic optimization. First, we show that the standard end-to-end learning algorithm admits a Bayesian interpretation and trains a posterior Bayes action map. Building on the insights of this analysis, we then propose new end-to-end learning algorithms for training decision maps that output solutions of empirical risk minimization and distributionally robust optimization problems, two dominant modeling paradigms in optimization under uncertainty. Numerical results for a synthetic newsvendor problem illustrate the key differences between alternative training schemes. We also investigate an economic dispatch problem based on real data to showcase the impact of the neural network architecture of the decision maps on their test performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于贝叶斯视角的随机优化端到端学习方法，该方法采用了标准端到端学习算法的思想，训练了一个后验贝叶斯行动映射。在此基础上，我们为解决经验风险最小化和分布式鲁棒优化问题提出了新的端到端学习算法。通过合成的newsvendor问题和基于真实数据的经济分配问题的数值结果，我们展示了不同训练方案之间的关键差异以及决策映射神经网络架构对测试性能的影响。",
