    "translated_abstract": "在许多应用程序中，学习系统需要处理连续的非稳态数据流。我们在在线学习框架中研究了这个问题，并提出了一种算法，可以处理对抗性的时变和非线性约束。正如我们在这项工作中所展示的那样，这个名为Constraint Violation Velocity Projection (CVV-Pro)的算法达到了$\\sqrt{T}$的遗憾率，并以$1/\\sqrt{T}$的速度收敛于可行集，尽管可行集缓慢地随时间变化且不为学习者所知。CVV-Pro仅依赖于可行集的局部稀疏线性逼近，因此避免了在每次迭代中优化整个集合，这与投影梯度或Frank-Wolfe方法形成鲜明对比。我们还在两个玩家游戏中对算法进行了实证评估，其中玩家受到共享约束的限制。",
