    "translated_abstract": "知识工程是创建和维护知识产生系统的过程。在计算机科学和人工智能的历史中，知识工程工作流程被广泛使用，因为高质量的知识被认为对可靠的智能代理至关重要。然而，知识工程的格局发生了变化，出现了四个挑战：未解决的利益相关者需求，技术不匹配，新组织的采用障碍，以及与软件工程实践的不协调。在本文中，我们提出通过使用主流的软件方法论来解决这些挑战，开发一个参考体系结构。通过研究不同利益相关者和时代的需求，我们确定了23个评估参考体系结构的重要质量属性。我们根据这些属性评估了近期文献中的三种候选体系结构。最后，我们讨论了迈向一个全面参考体系结构的下一步，包括...",
