    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统通过向用户提供个性化建议来解决信息过载问题。近年来，借鉴图表示学习的进展，越来越多的人开始关注采用图神经网络（GNNs）实现推荐系统。然而，这些基于GNN的模型主要关注用户的积极反馈而忽视了消极反馈的有价值见解。本文提出了一种创新的推荐模型PANE-GNN，用于统一正反馈的图神经网络。通过结合用户的偏好和反感，我们的方法增强了推荐系统提供个性化建议的能力。PANE-GNN将原始评分图分成基于正反馈的两个不同的二分图。随后，我们采用两个不同的嵌入，即兴趣嵌入和不兴趣嵌入，来表示用户和物品。最终的推荐分数是基于这两个嵌入的组合计算得出的。在三个真实世界的数据集上的实验表明，我们提出的PANE-GNN在推荐性能方面显著优于现有方法。",
