    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the challenge of summarizing patients' medical progress notes in a limited data setting. For the Problem List Summarization (shared task 1A) at the BioNLP Workshop 2023, we demonstrate that Clinical-T5 fine-tuned to 765 medical clinic notes outperforms other extractive, abstractive and zero-shot baselines, yielding reasonable baseline systems for medical note summarization. Further, we introduce Hierarchical Ensemble of Summarization Models (HESM), consisting of token-level ensembles of diverse fine-tuned Clinical-T5 models, followed by Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding. Our HESM approach lead to a considerable summarization performance boost, and when evaluated on held-out challenge data achieved a ROUGE-L of 32.77, which was the best-performing system at the top of the shared task leaderboard.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑在数据有限的情况下对患者医疗进展笔记进行摘要的挑战。在BioNLP Workshop 2023的Problem List Summarization (shared task 1A)中，我们证明了对765个医疗诊所笔记进行了精细调整的Clinical-T5优于其他基线系统，包括抽取式、生成式和零样例系统，从而为医疗笔记摘要提供了合理的基线系统。此外，我们引入了Hierarchical Ensemble of Summarization Models (HESM)，它由不同的精细调整过的Clinical-T5模型的标记级集合组成，然后采用最小贝叶斯风险（MBR）解码。我们的HESM方法大幅提高了摘要性能，并在保留挑战数据上进行评估时，达到了ROUGE-L为32.77，是共享任务排行榜前列的最佳表现系统。",
