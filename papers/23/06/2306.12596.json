    "abstract": "TalkBank is an online database that facilitates the sharing of linguistics research data. However, the existing TalkBank's API has limited data filtering and batch processing capabilities. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a pipeline framework that employs a hierarchical search approach, enabling efficient complex data selection. This approach involves a quick preliminary screening of relevant corpora that a researcher may need, and then perform an in-depth search for target data based on specific criteria. The identified files are then indexed, providing easier access for future analysis. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates how data from different studies curated with the framework can be integrated by standardizing and cleaning metadata, allowing researchers to extract insights from a large, integrated dataset. While being designed for TalkBank, the framework can also be adapted to process data from other open-science platforms.",

    "translated_abstract": "TalkBank是一个在线语言学研究数据共享数据库。然而，现有的TalkBank API具有有限的数据过滤和批处理功能。为了克服这些限制，本文介绍了一个管道框架，采用分层搜索方法，实现了复杂数据选择的高效率。该方法涉及对研究人员可能需要的相关文集进行快速的初步筛选，然后根据具体标准进行目标数据的深入搜索。确定的文件随后被索引，为未来的分析提供更容易的访问。此外，该论文演示了如何通过标准化和清理元数据，将使用该框架策划的不同研究的数据集成，使研究人员能够从一个大型集成数据集中提取见解。虽然该框架是为TalkBank设计的，但也可以适用于处理其他开放科学平台的数据。",
