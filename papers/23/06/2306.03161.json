    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the role of quantum entanglement and statistics in quantum learning. The paper studies the difference between entangled measurements and separable measurements as well as between entangled measurements and statistical measurements in learning models. It proves an exponential separation between QSQ learning and quantum learning with entangled measurements even in the presence of noise, demonstrating the quantum version of learning."
