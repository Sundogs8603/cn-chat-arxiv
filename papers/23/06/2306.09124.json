    "translated_abstract": "对抗性攻击，尤其是Patch攻击，对深度学习模型的鲁棒性和可靠性构成了重大威胁。开发可靠的防御方法以抵御Patch攻击对于实际应用至关重要，然而当前在这个领域的研究还不令人满意。在本文中，我们提出了DIFFender，一种新颖的防御方法，它利用文本引导的扩散模型来防御对抗性Patch。DIFFender包括两个主要阶段：Patch定位和Patch恢复。在定位阶段，我们发现并利用了扩散模型的一个有趣特性，以有效地识别对抗性Patch的位置。在恢复阶段，我们利用扩散模型重建图像中的对抗性区域同时保持视觉内容的完整性。重要的是，这两个阶段都受到统一的扩散模型的精心引导，因此我们可以利用它们之间的紧密相互作用来提高整个防御性能。",
