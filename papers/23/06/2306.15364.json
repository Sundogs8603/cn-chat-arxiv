    "abstract": "We present a simulated biologically plausible language organ, made up of stylized but realistic neurons, synapses, brain areas, plasticity, and a simplified model of sensory perception. We show through experiments that this model succeeds in an important early step in language acquisition: the learning of nouns, verbs, and their meanings, from the grounded input of only a modest number of sentences. Learning in this system is achieved through Hebbian plasticity, and without backpropagation. Our model goes beyond a parser previously designed in a similar environment, with the critical addition of a biologically plausible account for how language can be acquired in the infant's brain, not just processed by a mature brain.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个模拟的生物学上可信的语言器官，由风格化但逼真的神经元、突触、脑区、可塑性和简化的感觉知觉模型组成。通过实验证明，这个模型在语言习得的重要早期阶段取得了成功：从有限数量的句子的有意义输入中学习名词、动词及其意义。这个系统的学习是通过赫布连可塑性实现的，而没有使用反向传播。我们的模型超越了以前在类似环境中设计的解析器，关键是添加了一个生物学上可信的机制，解释了婴儿大脑如何习得语言，而不仅仅是成熟大脑的处理语言。",
