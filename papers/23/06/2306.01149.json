As an economic solution to compensate for potential damages, AI liability insurance is a promising market to enhance the integration of AI into daily life.

We discuss the insurability criteria for AI technologies and suggest necessary adjustments to accommodate the features of AI products.

    "translated_title": "人工智能责任保险：以AI辅助电子诊断系统为例",
    "translated_abstract": "人工智能在许多领域受到越来越多的关注。由于AI-powered系统中的不确定性和风险，在野外运用中引起了犹豫。作为一种经济解决方案来弥补潜在损害，AI责任保险是一个有前途的市场，可以增强AI对日常生活的整合。本文以一个AI辅助的电子诊断系统为例，研究AI责任保险。我们提供了一个定量风险评估模型，并进行了基于证据的数值分析。我们讨论了AI技术的可保险性标准，并建议必要的调整来适应AI产品的特点。我们表明，AI责任保险可以作为一种监管机制来激励合规行为，并作为高质量AI系统的证书。此外，我们建议调整保费以反映AI内在不确定性的动态演变。讨论了道德风险问题，并提出了对AI产品进行的建议。",
