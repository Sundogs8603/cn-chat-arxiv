    "translated_abstract": "在行为相关的脑计算领域，有必要将原始神经群体活动与它们之间的剧烈变化有意义地对齐。然而，由于大多数神经群体活动都以多变量时间序列的方式出现，因此对齐是非常棘手的。神经科学研究中的一个工具性框架认为，基于试验的神经群体活动依赖于低维度潜在动力学。关注这种潜在动力学大大促进了对齐过程。尽管我们取得了相当大的进展，但现有方法通常忽略了潜在动力学中固有的时空结构。因此，在对齐后导致动力学结构和整体性能质量较差。为了解决这个问题，我们提出一种利用扩散模型表达能力的方法来解决这些问题。具体而言，我们利用扩散模型首先提取源域的潜在动力学结构，然后在对齐时进行恢复。",
