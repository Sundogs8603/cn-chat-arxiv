    "abstract": "Images cannot always be expected to come in a certain standard format and orientation. Deep networks need to be trained to take into account unexpected variations in orientation or format. For this purpose, training data should be enriched to include different conditions. In this study, the effects of data enrichment on the performance of deep networks in the super resolution problem were investigated experimentally. A total of six basic image transformations were used for the enrichment procedures. In the experiments, two deep network models were trained with variants of the ILSVRC2012 dataset enriched by these six image transformation processes. Considering a single image transformation, it has been observed that the data enriched with 180 degree rotation provides the best results. The most unsuccessful result was obtained when the models were trained on the enriched data generated by the flip upside down process. Models scored highest when trained with a mix of all transformations.",

    "translated_abstract": "图像并不总是以某种标准格式和方向出现。深度网络需要被训练以考虑到意外的方向或格式变化。为此，训练数据应被增强包括不同的条件。本研究通过实验调查数据增强对超分辨率问题中深度网络性能的影响。总共使用了六种基本图像变换方法进行增强。实验中，使用六种图像转换方法增强ILSVRC2012数据集的变量来训练两个深度网络模型。发现单一的图像变换中，180°旋转增强的数据提供了最佳结果。模型在训练所有转换的混合数据时得分最高，最不成功的结果是模型在翻转上下生成的增强数据上进行训练。",
