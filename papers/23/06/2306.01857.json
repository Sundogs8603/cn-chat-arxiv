    "abstract": "Moral norms vary across cultures. A recent line of work suggests that English large language models contain human-like moral biases, but these studies typically do not examine moral variation in a diverse cultural setting. We investigate the extent to which monolingual English language models contain knowledge about moral norms in different countries. We consider two levels of analysis: 1) whether language models capture fine-grained moral variation across countries over a variety of topics such as ``homosexuality'' and ``divorce''; 2) whether language models capture cultural diversity and shared tendencies in which topics people around the globe tend to diverge or agree on in their moral judgment. We perform our analyses with two public datasets from the World Values Survey (across 55 countries) and PEW global surveys (across 40 countries) on morality. We find that pre-trained English language models predict empirical moral norms across countries worse than the English moral norms rep",

    "translated_abstract": "道德规范因文化而异。最近的一项工作表明，英文大型语言模型包含类似于人类的道德偏见，但这些研究通常不在一个多元文化背景下研究道德变化。我们研究了只会英文的语言模型对不同国家的道德规范了解程度。我们考虑两个层面：1）语言模型是否对多个主题如“同性恋”和“离婚”等在各个国家之间的细粒度道德变化有所了解；2）语言模型是否涵盖了文化多样性和共同倾向，即在哪些主题上人们在道德判断上存在分歧或共识。我们使用世界价值观调查（跨55个国家）和PEW全球调查（跨40个国家）的两个公共数据集进行分析。我们发现，预训练的英文语言模型在预测跨国家的实证道德规范方面的表现不及预测英国道德规范。",
