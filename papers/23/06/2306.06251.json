    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）已经成为通信系统中解决复杂和动态任务的强大工具，传统的基于规则的算法往往无法胜任。然而，大多数网络任务的AI应用都是针对特定和有限的条件设计和训练的，使得算法无法适应于常见的网络环境、任务和控制任务。本文提出了可持续和可扩展的AI集成通信系统的设计原则，侧重于创建可以在网络环境、意图和控制任务上具备通用性的AI算法。这种方法可以使少量的AI驱动的RAN函数来解决更大的问题，提高系统性能，并简化生命周期管理。为了实现可持续性和自动化，我们引入了一种可扩展的学习架构，该架构支持系统中部署的所有AI应用程序。该架构将中央化学习功能与分布式学习和数据采集功能分离，确保了系统的可扩展性和稳健性。",
