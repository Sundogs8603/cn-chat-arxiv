    "abstract": "Instruction Clarification Requests are a mechanism to solve communication problems, which is very functional in instruction-following interactions. Recent work has argued that the CoDraw dataset is a valuable source of naturally occurring iCRs. Beyond identifying when iCRs should be made, dialogue models should also be able to generate them with suitable form and content. In this work, we introduce CoDraw-iCR (v2), extending the existing iCR identifiers with fine-grained information grounded in the underlying dialogue game items and possible actions. Our annotation can serve to model and evaluate repair capabilities of dialogue agents.",
