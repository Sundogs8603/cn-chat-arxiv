    "abstract": "We study the power of menus of contracts in principal-agent problems with adverse selection (agents can be one of several types) and moral hazard (we cannot observe agent actions directly). For principal-agent problems with $T$ types and $n$ actions, we show that the best menu of contracts can obtain a factor $\\Omega(\\max(n, \\log T))$ more utility for the principal than the best individual contract, partially resolving an open question of Guruganesh et al. (2021). We then turn our attention to randomized menus of linear contracts, where we likewise show that randomized linear menus can be $\\Omega(T)$ better than the best single linear contract. As a corollary, we show this implies an analogous gap between deterministic menus of (general) contracts and randomized menus of contracts (as introduced by Castiglioni et al. (2022)).",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究研究了在面对不对称选择（代理人可以是几种类型）和道德风险（我们无法直接观察代理人行动）的委托-代理问题中，用于合同选择的菜单的强大作用。对于具有 $T$ 种类型和 $n$ 个行动的委托-代理问题，我们表明最佳合同菜单可以为委托人获得比最佳单个合同更多的效用，部分解决了 Guruganesh 等人 （2021）的一个未解决问题。然后，我们注意到线性合同的随机菜单，同样显示随机线性菜单可以比最佳单个线性合同更好。作为推论，我们表明这意味着确定性合同菜单和合同的随机菜单之间存在类似的差距。",
    "tldr": "本研究证明了用于委托-代理问题的合同菜单是比单个合同更优的，从而能为委托人带来更大的效用，实现了解决 Guruganesh 等人提出的问题。此外，我们也展示了线性合同的随机菜单优于单个线性合同。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study demonstrates the advantages of using contract menus over individual contracts in principal-agent problems, providing greater utility for the principal. This partially addresses an open question raised by Guruganesh et al. (2021). Additionally, the study shows that randomized menus of linear contracts outperform individual linear contracts."
