    "translated_abstract": "统计机器学习方法经常面临来自感兴趣总体的有限数据的挑战。一种解决方法是利用来自辅助源总体的数据，这些数据与目标领域的某些条件分布相同或以其他方式相连。利用这种\"数据转移\"条件的技术被称为\"领域适应\"或\"迁移学习\"。尽管有大量关于数据转移的文献，但很少有研究探讨如何有效利用辅助总体来提高目标总体上机器学习任务风险评估的准确性。在本文中，我们利用半参数效率理论研究了在不同的数据集转移条件下高效估计目标总体风险的一般问题。我们考虑了一类通用的数据集转移条件，其中包括三种流行条件——协变量、标签和概念转移——作为特例。我们允许部分非重叠。",
