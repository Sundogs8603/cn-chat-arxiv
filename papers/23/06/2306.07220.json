    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一个离线几何重建管道Strokes2Surface，它是基于4D Sketching Interface，MR.Sketch的目标是面向建筑设计的。该管道从设计师绘制的笔画中恢复曲线网络，因此在建筑设计的概念设计和数字建模阶段之间建立了桥梁。我们的管道的输入包括3D笔画的折线顶点及其相应的时间戳（作为第四个维度），以及额外的几何和笔触相关的记录属性。基于素描合并和基于素描建模方法的启发，我们的管道利用这些数据并组合三个机器学习（ML）模型；一个分类器和两个聚类模型。特别是，根据建筑设计素描中设计师通常采用的实践观察，我们解决了一个二元分类问题，以识别一笔画是描绘边界和边缘还是用于填充所需建筑物的封闭区域和表面。",
