    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了设计点击率（CTR）损失函数以在广告拍卖中优化（社会）福利。现有的研究要么只关注于CTR预测，而没有考虑广告拍卖中的业务目标（例如福利），要么假设参与者期望每次展示费用（eCPM）的分布是先验已知的，然后使用各种附加假设来推导用于预测CTR的损失函数。在这项工作中，我们将广告拍卖的福利目标带回CTR预测中，并提出了一种新型的加权排名损失函数来训练CTR模型。与现有文献相比，我们的方法在不假设eCPM分布的情况下提供了对福利的可证明保证，同时避免了朴素地应用现有学习排名方法时的棘手问题。此外，我们提出了一种在“老师网络”生成标签的情况下使用校准损失的理论可证明技术。",
