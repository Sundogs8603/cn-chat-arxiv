    "translated_abstract": "精准的产量预测对于制定食品安全的知情政策和长期决策至关重要。遥感数据和机器学习算法在提供从田间到国家尺度的作物状态的全面和及时视图方面发挥着关键作用。然而，机器学习算法的预测精度常常受到空间异质性的影响，这是由于遥感数据中没有反映的外在因素，如作物管理策略的差异性。在本文中，我们提出并研究了一种简单的技术，称为州级加性偏差，以明确解决哈萨克斯坦的跨地区产量异质性。与基线机器学习模型（随机森林、CatBoost、XGBoost）相比，我们的方法将总体RMSE降低了8.9\\%，将最高州级RMSE降低了28.37\\%。州级加性偏差的有效性表明，通过明确解决使用遥感数据进行作物产量预测的空间异质性，可以显著提高机器学习的性能。",
