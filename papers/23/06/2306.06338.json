    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了使用机器学习算法在分类数据集中预测和插补缺失值的方法。我们着重研究了使用误差纠正输出码(ECOC)框架的集成模型，包括基于SVM和KNN的集成模型，以及结合了SVM、KNN和MLP模型的集成分类器。我们将这些算法应用于三个数据集: CPU数据集、甲状腺功能减退数据集和乳腺癌数据集。实验结果表明，机器学习算法能够在预测和插补缺失值方面取得良好的性能，具体结果因数据集和缺失值模式而异。采用误差纠正输出码(ECOC)框架的集成模型相对于单个模型在提高预测准确性和鲁棒性方面特别有效。然而，使用深度学习进行缺失值插补也存在挑战和局限性。",
