    "abstract": "We study a variant of online multiclass classification where the learner predicts a single label but receives a \\textit{set of labels} as feedback. In this model, the learner is penalized for not outputting a label contained in the revealed set. We show that unlike online multiclass learning with single-label feedback, deterministic and randomized online learnability are \\textit{not equivalent} even in the realizable setting with set-valued feedback. Accordingly, we give two new combinatorial dimensions, named the Set Littlestone and Measure Shattering dimension, that tightly characterize deterministic and randomized online learnability respectively in the realizable setting. In addition, we show that the Measure Shattering dimension tightly characterizes online learnability in the agnostic setting. Finally, we show that practical learning settings like online multilabel ranking and online multilabel classification are specific instances of our general online learning framework.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在线多类分类的一种变体，其中学习器预测单个标签，但接收到一个标签的集合作为反馈。在该模型中，如果学习器没有输出包含在反馈集合中的标签，则会受到惩罚。我们表明，与具有单标签反馈的在线多类学习不同，在实现设置中使用集合型反馈时，确定性和随机化的在线可学习性\\textit{不等价}。因此，我们提供了两个新的组合维度，分别命名为集合小石和度量破裂维度，严格描述了确定性和随机化的在线可学习性。此外，我们表明度量破裂维度在悟性设置下严格描述在线可学习性。最后，我们证明了在线多标签排名和在线多标签分类等实际学习设置是我们通用在线学习框架的具体实例。",
