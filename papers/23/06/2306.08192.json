    "abstract": "Meta-learning has emerged as a powerful training strategy for few-shot node classification, demonstrating its effectiveness in the transductive setting. However, the existing literature predominantly focuses on transductive few-shot node classification, neglecting the widely studied inductive setting in the broader few-shot learning community. This oversight limits our comprehensive understanding of the performance of meta-learning based methods on graph data. In this work, we conduct an empirical study to highlight the limitations of current frameworks in the inductive few-shot node classification setting. Additionally, we propose a simple yet competitive baseline approach specifically tailored for inductive few-shot node classification tasks. We hope our work can provide a new path forward to better understand how the meta-learning paradigm works in the graph domain.",

    "translated_abstract": "元学习已成为少样本节点分类的有效训练策略，在转导设置下展示其有效性。然而，现有文献主要关注转导少样本节点分类，忽略了更广泛的少样本学习社区中广泛研究的归纳设置。这个疏忽限制了我们对基于元学习方法在图形数据上的性能的全面理解。在这项工作中，我们进行了实证研究，突出了当前框架在归纳少样本节点分类设置中的局限性。此外，我们提出了一个针对归纳少样本节点分类任务特别设计的简单但有竞争力的基线方法。我们希望我们的工作能够为更好地理解元学习范式在图形领域的工作方式提供新的道路。",
