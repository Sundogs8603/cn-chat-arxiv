    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种非参数的在线市场制度检测方法，用于多维数据结构，利用基于路径空间上的最大均值差异相似度度量的路径样本检验。该相似度度量已经在最近的小规模数据环境的生成模型中作为鉴别器进行了发展和应用，并在此进行了优化，以适应新进数据量特别少的情况，以加快反应速度。在同样的原则下，我们还提出了一种基于路径的制度聚类方法，扩展了我们之前的工作。所提出的制度聚类技术被设计为前期市场分析工具，可以识别出大致相似的市场活动期间，但新的结果同时适用于基于路径的、高维度的和非马尔可夫的设置，以及表现出自相关性的数据结构。",

The method uses a path-wise two-sample test based on a maximum mean discrepancy-based similarity metric on path space and is optimized for faster reactivity in scenarios with small incoming data. The approach also applies to high-dimensional, non-Markovian, and autocorrelated data structures."
