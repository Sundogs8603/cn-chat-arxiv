    "translated_abstract": "在家庭场景中进行的软物体操作任务由于其复杂的动态特性和可变的形状特征，对现有机器人技能学习技术提出了重大挑战。由于从人类演示中学习新的操作技能是机器人应用的有效方式，因此开发软物体表示和动态的先前知识是必要的。在这方面，我们提出了一种名为SoftGPT的预训练软物体操作技能学习模型，该模型使用大量的探索数据进行训练，包括三维异构图表示和基于GPT的动态模型。针对每个下游任务，训练一个面向目标的策略代理以预测后续动作，SoftGPT生成这些动作的后果。将这两种方法集成在一起，建立了机器人思考过程，为促进策略学习提供了展开。我们的结果表明，利用软物体动力学和表示的先前知识使SoftGPT能够学习面向目标的软物体操作技能，从而胜过现有的最先进方法。",
