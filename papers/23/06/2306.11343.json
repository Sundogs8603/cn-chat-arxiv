    "translated_abstract": "在传统的监督分类中，需要对个体实例进行真实标签的收集。然而，出于隐私和昂贵的注释成本等原因，为个体实例收集真实标签可能是困难的。这激发了对基于聚合观测的分类（CFAO）的研究，其中监督是以组的形式提供的，而不是个体实例。CFAO是一个广义的学习框架，包含了各种学习问题，如多实例学习和从标签比例学习。本文的目标是提出一个新的CFAO通用方法，其具有任意损失的分类风险的无偏估计器--以前的研究未能实现这一目标。在实践中，我们的方法通过权衡群组中每个实例的每个标签的重要性，为分类器提供纯化的监督来学习。从理论上讲，我们提出的方法不仅保证了风险的控制，而且还提供了确定风险上界的有效方法。",
