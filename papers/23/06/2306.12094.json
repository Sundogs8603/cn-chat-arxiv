    "abstract": "Understanding human mobility patterns is important in applications as diverse as urban planning, public health, and political organizing. One rich source of data on human mobility is taxi ride data. Using the city of Chicago as a case study, we examine data from taxi rides in 2016 with the goal of understanding how neighborhoods are interconnected. This analysis will provide a sense of which neighborhoods individuals are using taxis to travel between, suggesting regions to focus new public transit development efforts. Additionally, this analysis will map traffic circulation patterns and provide an understanding of where in the city people are traveling from and where they are heading to perhaps informing traffic or road pollution mitigation efforts. For the first application, representing the data as an undirected graph will suffice. Transit lines run in both directions so simply a knowledge of which neighborhoods have high rates of taxi travel between them provides an argument for p",

    "translated_abstract": "理解人类移动模式在城市规划、公共卫生和政治组织等应用中都很重要。出租车数据是人类移动的丰富数据来源。以芝加哥为例，我们研究了2016年出租车行程的数据，旨在了解各个社区之间的相互联系。该分析将提供人们使用出租车来往哪些社区的信息，为新的公共交通发展提供了重要指导。此外，该分析还将绘制交通循环模式图，了解人们从城市的哪个地方出发以及他们前往的目的地，从而更好地指导交通或道路污染的缓解工作。对于第一个应用，将数据表示为无向图就足够了。运输线路向两个方向延伸，因此仅知道哪些社区之间出租车的使用率较高就足以为公众交通发展提供了支持。",
