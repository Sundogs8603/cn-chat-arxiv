    "translated_abstract": "在医疗保健领域，多模态数据广泛存在，并且需要在诊断决策之前进行全面分析，包括医学图像、临床报告等。然而，当前的大规模人工智能模型主要关注单模态的认知能力，忽视了多模态的整合。因此，我们提出了 Stone Needle，一个专门为医疗保健应用而设计的通用多模态大规模模型框架。Stone Needle作为一个全面的医疗多模态模型基础，集成了文本、图像、视频和音频等各种模态，克服了单模态系统的限制。通过意图分析、医疗基础模型、提示管理器和医学语言模块等框架组件，我们的架构能够在多轮对话中进行多模态交互。我们的方法是一个通用的多模态大规模模型框架，集成了多样化的模态，并允许我们进行定制。",
