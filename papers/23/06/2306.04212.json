    "translated_abstract": "由于图形学习的卓越性能，图神经网络（GNN）已被应用于许多场景。然而，在设计GNN时常常忽略公平性。因此，训练数据中的有偏信息很容易影响普通的GNN，导致对特定人口群体（根据敏感属性，如种族和年龄划分）的偏见结果。已经有一些努力来解决公平性问题。然而，现有的公平技术通常通过原始敏感属性将族群进行划分，并假定它们是固定的。与原始敏感属性相关的有偏信息将通过训练过程，无论实施公平技术与否。迫切需要解决这个问题，以训练公平的GNN。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个全新的框架，FairMigration，它可以动态迁移族群，而不是用原始的敏感属性固定它们。FairMigration由两个训练阶段组成。",
