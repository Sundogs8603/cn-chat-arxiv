    "translated_abstract": "为了解决隐私问题并减少网络延迟，近年来一直有将在云端训练的臃肿的推荐模型压缩并在资源受限的设备上部署紧凑的推荐器模型以进行实时推荐的趋势。现有的解决方案通常忽视了设备异质性和用户异质性。它们要么要求所有设备共享相同的压缩模型，要么要求具有相同资源预算的设备共享相同模型。然而，即使是具有相同设备的用户可能也具有不同的偏好。此外，它们假设设备上的推荐器可用资源（如内存）是恒定的，这与现实情况不符。鉴于设备和用户的异质性以及动态资源约束，本文提出了一种用于设备上的个性化弹性嵌入学习框架（PEEL），该框架以一次性方式为具有不同内存预算的设备生成个性化的嵌入。",
