    "translated_abstract": "自划时代的Chevron决定以来，几乎已经过去了将近三十年，最高法院尚未阐明该案的机构法解释原则与我们这个时代最具争议的联邦主义问题之一——州法规管辖权——之间的关系。法院应该在Chevron下遵从阻止机构的解释，还是预先防止的联邦主义影响要求提出一种不太顺从的解决方案？评论员提供了无数可能的解决方案，但迄今为止，法院已经抵制了所有这些解决方案。本文对这场辩论作出了两个贡献。首先，通过对法院最近的机构阻止决定进行详细分析，追踪其对各种提出的规则犹豫不决的态度，并体现出对传统州权领域的国会意图的高度重视。法院认识到，授权阻止的国会意图在每个案件中都有所不同，因此一直犹豫采用全面的规则。",
