    "translated_abstract": "搜索引擎在满足用户多种信息需求方面发挥着关键作用。最近，基于预训练语言模型（PLMs）的文本排名模型在Web搜索中取得了巨大成功。然而，许多最先进的文本排名方法仅关注核心相关性，而忽略了其他有助于用户满意度的维度，例如文档质量、时效性、权威性等。在这项工作中，我们关注的是在网络搜索中排名用户满意度，而不是相关性，并提出了一种基于PLM的框架，即SAT-Ranker，它以统一的方式全面建模用户满意度的不同维度。特别地，我们利用PLM在文本和数字输入方面的能力，并应用多字段输入，将每个用户满意度维度作为输入字段进行模块化。总体而言，SAT-Ranker是一个有效、可扩展和数据中心的框架，具有巨大的工业应用潜力。在严格的线下和线上实验中，SAT-Ranker表现优异，优于强基线，并在MSR-Web30K和TREC Web Track数据集上实现了最先进的结果。",
