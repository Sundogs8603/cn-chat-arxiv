    "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a crucial task for online advertisement. State-of-the-art solutions leverage pre-trained language models for this task. However, three major challenges remain unresolved: web queries differ from natural language, on which pre-trained models are trained; web queries are short and lack contextual information; and labeled data for NER is scarce. We propose DeepTagger, a knowledge-enhanced NER model for web-based ads queries. The proposed knowledge enhancement framework leverages both model-free and model-based approaches. For model-free enhancement, we collect unlabeled web queries to augment domain knowledge; and we collect web search results to enrich the information of ads queries. We further leverage effective prompting methods to automatically generate labels using large language models such as ChatGPT. Additionally, we adopt a model-based knowledge enhancement method based on adversarial data augmentation. We employ a three-stage training framework ",

    "translated_abstract": "命名实体识别（NER）是在线广告的关键任务。最先进的解决方案利用预训练的语言模型来完成这项任务。然而，仍存在三个主要挑战：网络查询与预训练模型训练的自然语言不同；网络查询短小，缺乏上下文信息；NER的标记数据稀缺。我们提出了DeepTagger，一种基于知识增强的网络广告查询的NER模型。所提出的知识增强框架利用模型无关和模型基于方法。对于模型无关的增强，我们收集未标记的网络查询来增加领域知识；还收集网络搜索结果来丰富广告查询的信息。我们进一步利用ChatGPT等大型语言模型采用有效的提示方法自动生成标签。另外，我们采用基于对抗数据增强的模型基于知识增强方法。我们采用三阶段的训练框架。",
