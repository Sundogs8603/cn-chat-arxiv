    "abstract": "This paper presents the ADAIO team's system entry in the Building Educational Applications (BEA) 2023 Shared Task on Generating AI Teacher Responses in Educational Dialogues. The task aims to assess the performance of state-of-the-art generative models as AI teachers in producing suitable responses within a student-teacher dialogue. Our system comprises evaluating various baseline models using OpenAI GPT-3 and designing diverse prompts to prompt the OpenAI models for teacher response generation. After the challenge, our system achieved second place by employing a few-shot prompt-based approach with the OpenAI text-davinci-003 model. The results highlight the few-shot learning capabilities of large-language models, particularly OpenAI's GPT-3, in the role of AI teachers.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了ADAIO团队在\"Building Educational Applications (BEA) 2023\"共享任务中，生成教育对话中AI教师回应的系统方案。本任务旨在评估最先进的生成模型作为AI教师，在学生与教师的对话中产生合适回应的表现。我们使用OpenAI GPT-3评估了各种基准模型，并设计了不同的提示方式来激发OpenAI模型生成教师回应。在竞赛中，我们的系统使用了基于少量提示的方法，采用了OpenAI的text-davinci-003模型，获得了第二名的成绩。结果突出了大型语言模型（尤其是OpenAI的GPT-3）在AI教师角色中的少量提示学习能力。",
