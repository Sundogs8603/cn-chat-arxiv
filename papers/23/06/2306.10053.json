    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统已成为增强各个领域用户体验的必备工具。尽管针对电影、音乐和电子商务的推荐系统已进行了广泛研究，但日益增长和经济意义重大的非同质化代币（NFT）市场仍未被充分探索。NFT市场的独特特性和日益突出的地位凸显了开发专门针对其需求的定制推荐系统的重要性，并揭示其充分潜力。本文分析了NFT的独特特性，并提出了首个专门设计以应对NFT市场挑战的推荐系统。具体而言，我们开发了一种面向NFT的多注意力推荐系统(NFT-MARS)，具有三个关键特征：(1)图形注意力以处理稀疏的用户-项目交互;(2)多模态注意力以融入用户的特征偏好;(3)多任务学习来考虑NFT作为艺术作品和数字资产的双重性质。",
