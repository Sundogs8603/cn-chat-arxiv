    "abstract": "Retinal eye diseases can lead to irreversible vision loss in both eyes if not diagnosed and treated earlier. Owing to the complexities of retinal diseases, the likelihood that retinal images would contain two or more abnormalities is very high. The current deep learning algorithms used for segmenting retinal images with multiple labels and features suffer from inadequate detection accuracy and a lack of generalizability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and efficient network, featuring dual multi-residual connections to enhance segmentation performance while minimizing computational cost. The proposed network is evaluated on eight publicly available retinal image datasets and achieved promising segmentation results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network for retinal image analysis tasks. The proposed network's lightweight and efficient design makes it a promising candidate for real-time retinal image analysis applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "视网膜眼病如果不及早诊断和治疗，可能导致双眼不可逆的视力损失。由于视网膜疾病的复杂性，视网膜图像可能包含两个或更多异常。目前用于分割带有多个标签和特征的视网膜图像的深度学习算法存在检测准确性不足和泛化性不强的问题。本文提出了一种轻量级高效的网络，采用双重多重残差连接增强分割性能并最小化计算成本。所提出的网络在8个公开可用的视网膜图像数据集上进行了评估，并取得了有希望的分割结果，证明了所提出的网络对于视网膜图像分析任务的有效性。所提出的网络的轻量级高效设计使其成为实时视网膜图像分析应用的有希望的候选者。",
