    "abstract": "Machine learning and deep learning models have become essential in the recent fast development of artificial intelligence in many sectors of the society. It is now widely acknowledge that the development of these models has an environmental cost that has been analyzed in many studies. Several online and software tools have been developed to track energy consumption while training machine learning models. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive introduction and comparison of these tools for AI practitioners wishing to start estimating the environmental impact of their work. We review the specific vocabulary, the technical requirements for each tool. We compare the energy consumption estimated by each tool on two deep neural networks for image processing and on different types of servers. From these experiments, we provide some advice for better choosing the right tool and infrastructure.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习和深度学习模型在社会各个领域的快速发展中变得至关重要。人们普遍认识到这些模型的发展存在环境成本，已经有很多研究对此进行了分析。已经开发了几种在线和软件工具来跟踪机器学习模型训练过程中的能源消耗。在本文中，我们提出了对这些工具进行全面介绍和比较，并针对希望开始估计其工作环境影响的AI从业人员进行了讨论。我们对每个工具的特定词汇和技术要求进行了评估，并比较了这些工具对两个用于图像处理的深度神经网络和不同类型服务器的能源消耗估计结果。根据这些实验，我们提供了一些建议，以更好地选择合适的工具和基础设施。",
