    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了 Zambezi Voice，它是一种针对赞比亚语的开源多语种语音资源。它包含两个数据集合：一组无标签的收音机新闻和谈话节目的音频录音（160小时），以及一组被标注的数据（超过80小时），其中包括从公共可得的文学书籍中源自的文本的朗读语音。该数据集被创建用于语音识别，但可以扩展到有监督和无监督学习方法的多语种语音处理研究。据我们所知，这是为赞比亚语创造的第一个多语种语音数据集。我们通过微调Wav2Vec2.0大规模多语种预训练模型来利用预训练和跨语言转移学习来构建基线模型的端到端（E2E）语音识别模型。该数据集在公共领域下发布，并可通过项目代码库进行访问。请参见 https://github.com/unza-speech-lab/zambezi-v。",
