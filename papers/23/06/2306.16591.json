    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个因果框架来将结果中的组差异分解为中间处理变量。我们的框架捕捉了基线潜在结果、处理前沿、平均处理效应和处理选择的组差异的贡献。这个框架以反事实的方式进行了数学表达，并且能够方便地指导政策干预。特别是，针对不同的处理选择进行的分解部分是特别新颖的，揭示了一种解释和改善差异的新机制。这个框架以因果术语重新定义了经典的Kitagawa-Blinder-Oaxaca分解，通过解释组差异而不是组效应来补充了因果中介分析，并解决了近期随机等化分解的概念困难。我们还提供了一个条件分解，允许研究人员在定义评估和相应的干预措施时纳入协变量。",
