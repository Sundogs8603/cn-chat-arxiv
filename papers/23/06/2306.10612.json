    "translated_abstract": "本文研究流动性提供者（LP）在Curve的StableSwap池中对稳定币和流动性质押衍生品（LSD）depeg的风险。我们构建了一套基于价格和交易数据的度量标准，旨在检测潜在的资产depeg。使用我们的度量标准，我们微调了贝叶斯在线变点检测（BOCD）算法，以在depeg发生之前或发生时提醒LP。我们对2022年至2023年期间13个StableSwap池中的Curve LP代币价格进行了训练和测试，重点关注稳定币和LSD depeg。我们展示了我们的模型，在2022年的UST数据上训练后，能够在2023年3月10日UTC晚上9点之前，即USDC跌破99美分约5个小时就检测到USDC depeg，并在测试期间几乎没有误报。最后，我们描述了这项研究如何被Curve的流动性提供者使用，并说明它如何通过调整参数来动态降低Curve池的风险。",
