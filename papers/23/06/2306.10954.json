    "translated_abstract": "基于表面肌电图(sEMG)信号的手势识别是发展自然控制的人机界面(HMIs)的一种有前途的方法，比如直观的机器人界面或多关节假肢。然而，由于运动伪影、姿态和时间变化以及传感器重新定位等可靠性问题，真实应用受到限制。本文是在Unibo-INAIL数据集上首次应用深度学习，该数据集是第一个公开的sEMG数据集，通过采集每个7个健康被试者在4种姿势下执行6种手势的8个会话，来探索被试者之间、会话之间和手臂姿势之间的可变性。最近的研究通过基于训练集构成的策略来解决可变性问题，改善非深度机器学习分类器的跨姿势和跨天泛化能力，其中径向基核SVM的准确率最高。本研究实现的深度结构是一个1d-CNN。",
