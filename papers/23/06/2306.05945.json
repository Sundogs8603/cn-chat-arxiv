    "translated_abstract": "使用近似的 Koopman 算子对高维时间序列进行动力学分析已变得很普遍，将其转换为排名动态模式。该方法实际成功的关键在于识别形成良好基础的一组可观测变量来扩展慢松弛模式。然而，良好的可观测变量很难事先识别，并且次优选择可能会导致时间尺度的显著低估。通过利用用隐马尔可夫模型 (HMM) 表示慢动力学，我们提出了一种简单的计算有效的分类过程，以推断形成慢模式良好基础的代理可观测变量。我们将该方法应用于一个解析可解的模型系统，以及三个不同复杂度的蛋白质系统。我们一致地证明，推断得到的指标函数可以显着改善 Koopman 算子的主要特征值的估计。",
