    "translated_abstract": "量子数据访问和量子处理可以使某些经典难以处理的学习任务变得可行。然而，量子能力在不久的将来只能提供给少数人使用。因此，需要可靠的方案，允许经典客户委托学习给不可信的量子服务器，以促进广泛获得量子学习的优势。本文基于最近引入的古典机器学习交互证明系统框架，构建了一个经典验证量子学习的框架。我们展示了一些经典学习者无法自行高效求解的学习问题，但当与不可信的量子证明者交互时，他们可以高效且可靠地解决这些问题。具体而言，我们考虑了关于具有均匀输入边缘密度的对仗学习奇偶性和傅里叶稀疏函数的问题。我们提出了一个新的量子数据访问模型，称为“叠加混合量子样例”。",
