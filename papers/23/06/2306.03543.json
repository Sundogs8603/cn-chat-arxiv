    "abstract": "In Active Learning (AL), a learner actively chooses which unlabeled examples to query for labels from an oracle, under some budget constraints. Different AL query strategies are more suited to different problems and budgets. Therefore, in practice, knowing in advance which AL strategy is most suited for the problem at hand remains an open problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a practical derivative-based method that dynamically identifies the best strategy for each budget. We provide theoretical analysis of a simplified case to motivate our approach and build intuition. We then introduce a method to dynamically select an AL strategy based on the specific problem and budget. Empirical results showcase the effectiveness of our approach across diverse budgets and computer vision tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "在主动学习中，学习者在一定的预算约束下主动选择未标记示例以向神谕请求其标记。不同的主动学习查询策略更适合不同的问题和预算。因此，在实践中，事先知道哪个主动学习策略最适合手头的问题仍然是一个未解决的问题。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种基于导数的实用方法，动态地识别每个预算的最佳策略。我们提供了一个简化情况的理论分析来激发我们的方法并建立直觉。然后介绍了一种基于具体问题和预算来动态选择主动学习策略的方法。实证结果展示了我们的方法在不同预算和计算机视觉任务中的有效性。",
