    "translated_abstract": "传统的CTR预测模型将表格数据转换为one-hot向量，并利用特征之间的协作关系来推断用户对项目的偏好。这种建模范式抛弃了基本的语义信息。尽管一些最近的工作（如P5和M6-Rec）已经探索了使用预训练语言模型（PLMs）提取CTR预测的语义信号的潜力，但它们计算成本高，效率低。此外，尚未考虑到有益的协作关系，从而阻碍了推荐的性能。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个新的框架CTRL，它是工业友好的和模型不可知的，具有高训练和推理效率。具体而言，原始的表格数据首先被转换为文本数据。两种不同的模态被分别视为两个模态，并分别输入协作CTR模型中以建模它们的交互作用。我们还提出了信息蒸馏机制，从PLMs中提取关于CTR预测的语义信息，进一步提高了模型的性能。在三个真实的工业数据集上，我们的模型在比较其他现有的模型时均达到了最新的SOTA性能水平。",
