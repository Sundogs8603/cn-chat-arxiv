    "abstract": "Image Captioning (IC) models can highly benefit from human feedback in the training process, especially in cases where data is limited. We present work-in-progress on adapting an IC system to integrate human feedback, with the goal to make it easily adaptable to user-specific data. Our approach builds on a base IC model pre-trained on the MS COCO dataset, which generates captions for unseen images. The user will then be able to offer feedback on the image and the generated/predicted caption, which will be augmented to create additional training instances for the adaptation of the model. The additional instances are integrated into the model using step-wise updates, and a sparse memory replay component is used to avoid catastrophic forgetting. We hope that this approach, while leading to improved results, will also result in customizable IC models.",

    "translated_abstract": "图像字幕 (IC) 模型在训练过程中可以从人类反馈中获益，特别是在数据有限的情况下。我们正在进行适应 IC 系统以集成人类反馈的工作，目标是使其易于适应用户特定数据。我们的方法建立在预先训练了 MS COCO 数据集上的基础 IC 模型上，该模型为看不见的图像生成字幕。然后，用户将能够提供对图片和生成/预测字幕的反馈，这将被增加以创建模型适应的其他训练实例。这些附加实例使用逐步更新集成到模型中，并使用稀疏内存回放组件以避免灾难性遗忘。我们希望这种方法不仅能导致改进的结果，而且还能产生可定制的 IC 模型。",
