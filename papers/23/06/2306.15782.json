    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖方法来解决印刷乌尔都文本识别的挑战，使用高分辨率、多尺度的语义特征提取。我们提出的UTRNet架构，一个混合CNN-RNN模型，在基准数据集上展示了最先进的性能。为了解决以前工作的局限性，这些工作很难推广到乌尔都文本的复杂性和缺乏足够的实际标记数据，我们引入了UTRSet-Real，一个包含超过11,000行的大规模实际标记数据集和UTRSet-Synth，一个与实际世界非常相似的含有20,000行的合成数据集，并对现有的IIITH数据集的基准真实性进行了修正，使其成为未来研究的更可靠的资源。我们还提供了UrduDoc，一种用于扫描文档中乌尔都文本行检测的基准数据集。此外，我们还开发了一种在线工具，通过将UTRNet与文本的端到端乌尔都OCR集成在印刷文档中。",
