    "abstract": "Music datasets play a crucial role in advancing research in machine learning for music. However, existing music datasets suffer from limited size, accessibility, and lack of audio resources. To address these shortcomings, we present DISCO-10M, a novel and extensive music dataset that surpasses the largest previously available music dataset by an order of magnitude. To ensure high-quality data, we implement a multi-stage filtering process. This process incorporates similarities based on textual descriptions and audio embeddings. Moreover, we provide precomputed CLAP embeddings alongside DISCO-10M, facilitating direct application on various downstream tasks. These embeddings enable efficient exploration of machine learning applications on the provided data. With DISCO-10M, we aim to democratize and facilitate new research to help advance the development of novel machine learning models for music.",

    "translated_abstract": "音乐数据集在推动音乐机器学习研究方面发挥着至关重要的作用。然而，现有音乐数据集存在规模有限、可访问性差和缺乏音频资源等缺点。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了DISCO-10M，这是一个新颖而广泛的音乐数据集，其规模超过了之前最大的可用音乐数据集一个数量级。为确保高质量的数据，我们实施了一个多阶段过滤流程。这个过程结合了基于文本描述和音频嵌入的相似性。此外，我们提供了预计算的CLAP嵌入和DISCO-10M，便于直接应用于各种下游任务。这些嵌入使得对所提供数据的机器学习应用的高效探索成为可能。我们旨在通过DISCO-10M，推动音乐机器学习模型开发的新研究，以实现民主化和促进发展。",
