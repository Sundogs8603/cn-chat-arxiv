    "translated_abstract": "尽管联邦学习（FL）通过模型聚合提高了端到端自动驾驶的泛化能力，但传统的单跳联邦学习（SFL）由于车辆和云服务器之间的远程通信而收敛速度较慢。分层联邦学习（HFL）通过引入中间边缘服务器克服了这些缺点。然而，受限的通信资源和HFL性能之间的协调成为一个紧迫的问题。本文提出了一种基于优化的通信资源受限的分层联邦学习（CRCHFL）框架，通过使用混合数据和模型聚合来最小化自动驾驶模型的泛化误差。通过在CARLA仿真平台上评估了所提出的CRCHFL的有效性。结果表明，所提出的CRCHFL既加快了收敛速度，又增强了联邦学习自动驾驶模型的泛化能力。",
