    "translated_abstract": "机器学习力场(MLFF)被提出以加速分子动力学(MD)模拟，该模拟在化学和生物医学研究中应用广泛。即使对于最节约数据的MLFF，要达到化学精度可能需要数百帧由昂贵的量子力学算法生成的力和能量标签，这些算法的规模可能为$O(n^3)$至$O(n^7)$，其中$n$与基函数的数量成比例。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个多阶段计算框架ASTEROID，通过利用便宜的不准确数据和昂贵的准确数据降低了MLFF的数据成本。ASTEROID的动机是，尽管不准确的数据会产生很大的偏差，但它可以帮助捕捉基础力场的复杂结构。因此，我们首先在大量不准确的训练数据上使用偏差感知损失函数训练MLFF模型，以防止模型过拟合可能导致的偏差。",
