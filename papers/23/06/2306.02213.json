    "translated_abstract": "情感曲线捕捉了一个人（或一个群体）随时间变化的情感状态。它们被广泛应用于工业和研究领域；然而，对于自动生成的情感曲线的评估工作很少。这是因为建立真实（黄金）情感曲线的困难。我们的工作首次对自动生成的情感曲线进行了系统和定量的评估。我们还比较了两种常见的情感曲线生成方法：机器学习（ML）模型和仅词典（LexO）方法。通过在9种语言的18个不同数据集上进行实验，我们表明尽管在实例级情感分类方面表现差，但LexO方法在从数百个实例中聚合信息时生成情感曲线的准确性非常高。我们还通过对六种非洲土著语言以及阿拉伯语和西班牙语的实验表明，英语情感词典的自动翻译可以用于生成高质量的情感曲线，而资源开销相对较小。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study provides a systematic and quantitative evaluation of automatically generated emotion arcs, comparing machine learning models and lexicon-only methods. The experiments on diverse datasets in various languages show that lexicon-only methods, despite poor performance at instance level emotion classification, can accurately generate emotion arcs when aggregating information from multiple instances. The study also demonstrates the use of automatic translations of English emotion lexicons to generate high-quality emotion arcs with less resources."
