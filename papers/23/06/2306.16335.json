    "translated_abstract": "在这项研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的替代建模方法，可以高效准确地近似复杂动态系统对随时间变化的外部刺激的响应，并且可以延长时间段。我们的方法被称为“带外部输入的流形非线性自回归建模”（mNARX），它涉及构建一个问题特定的外部输入流形，以便构造自回归替代模型。这个流形是mNARX的核心，通过结合系统的物理性质以及先前的专家和领域知识来逐步构建。因为mNARX将整个问题分解成一系列更小的子问题，每个子问题的复杂度比原来的低，所以它在问题的复杂性方面具有良好的可扩展性，无论是最终替代模型的训练成本还是评估成本。此外，mNARX与传统的降维技术非常契合，使其非常适合建模。",
