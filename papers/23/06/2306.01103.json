Existing graph OOD algorithms either rely on restricted assumptions or fail to exploit environment information in training data. In this work, we propose to simultaneously incorporate label and environment causal independence (LECI) to fully make use of label and environment information, thereby addressing the challenges faced by prior methods on identifying causal and invariant subgraphs. We further develop an adversarial training strategy to jointly optimize these two properties for casual subgraph discovery with theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments and analysis show that LECI significantly outperforms prior methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, establishing LECI as a practical and effective solution for graph OOD generalization.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了图形的超出分布（OOD）泛化问题。现有的图形OOD算法要么依赖于受限的假设，要么无法利用训练数据中的环境信息。在这项工作中，我们提出同时纳入标签和环境因果独立（LECI），充分利用标签和环境信息，从而解决之前的方法在识别因果和不变子图时面临的挑战。我们进一步开发了一种敌对训练策略，以联合优化这两个属性，用于具有理论保证的导致子图发现。广泛的实验和分析表明，LECI在合成和真实数据集上都显着优于之前的方法，将LECI确立为图形OOD泛化的实用有效解决方案。",
