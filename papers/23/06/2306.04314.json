    "translated_abstract": "论证挖掘的可用语料库在多个方面存在差异，其中一个关键差异是话语标记的存在（或缺失）以表明论证内容。从不同的话语分析任务中探索有效使用话语标记的方法，这受到了广泛关注，其中引出的结论是话语标记是话语关系的强有力指标。为了提高跨不同文体的论证挖掘系统的鲁棒性，我们提出自动通过增加话语标记来增强给定文本，从而明确地标示出所有关系。我们的分析揭示出来，直接使用流行的语言模型无法完成这个任务；然而，当其在我们构建的新异构数据集上进行微调训练（包括合成和真实示例），它们的表现显著提高。我们展示了我们方法的影响，通过在不同语料库上进行评估的论证挖掘下游任务来展示，说明可以训练语言模型以自动完成论证挖掘。",
