    "translated_abstract": "Foley音效生成旨在为多媒体内容生成背景音效。先前的模型通常使用大量有标签的开发集作为输入（例如，单个数字或one-hot向量）。本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的Foley音效生成系统，可进行文本条件的生成。为了缓解数据稀缺问题，我们的模型首先使用大规模数据集进行预训练，然后通过对比语言-音频配对（CLAP）技术进行迁移学习来对该任务进行微调。我们观察到，文本编码器提取的特征嵌入可以显著影响生成模型的性能。因此，我们在编码器之后引入可训练的层来改善编码器产生的文本嵌入。此外，我们通过同时生成多个候选音频片段并选择最佳片段来进一步改进生成的波形，最佳片段是根据嵌入之间相似性得分确定的。",
