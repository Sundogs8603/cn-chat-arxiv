    "translated_abstract": "动态结构因果模型（SCMs）是一个强大的框架，用于推理动态系统中的直接效应，即衡量一个变量的变化如何影响另一个变量，同时保持其他变量不变。动态结构因果模型中的因果关系可以用完全时间因果图来进行定性表示。假设线性和因果充分性，并给定完全时间因果图，直接因果效应总是可辨识的，并可以通过调整由所谓的单门准则给出的任何变量集合来从数据中估计。然而，在许多应用中，由于各种原因没有此类图形可用，但专家仍然可以访问完全时间因果图的一个抽象，该抽象表示了时间序列之间的因果关系，同时省略了时间信息。本文提出了一个完整的可辨识性结果，其中详细描述了所有直接效应在总结因果图中可辨识的情况。",
