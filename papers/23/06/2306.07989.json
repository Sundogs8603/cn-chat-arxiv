    "translated_abstract": "近年来，非Windows恶意软件威胁的增加已经成为网络安全界的焦点。围绕Hunting Windows PE-Based Malwares的研究工作正在成熟，而针对Linux恶意软件威胁的发展相对较少。随着物联网（IoT）时代的到来，融入人类生活的智能设备已经成为黑客进行恶意活动的一条通道。IoT设备采用各种基于Unix的架构，遵循ELF（可执行和可链接格式）作为它们的标准二进制文件规范。本研究旨在提供关于跨体系结构IoT恶意软件检测和分类方法的最新发展的全面调查。在现代分类法的帮助下，我们讨论了在调查工作中采用的特征表示，特征提取技术和机器学习模型。我们进一步提供了关于跨体系结构IoT恶意软件威胁调查中的实际挑战的更多见解。",
