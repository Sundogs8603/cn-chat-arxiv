    "translated_abstract": "教育聊天机器人承诺提供互动和个性化学习体验，然而，它们的发展受到了现有平台受限的自由互动能力和知识以适宜格式编码的困难的限制。最近的语言学习模型的进展表明，使用基于提示的方法开发教育聊天机器人是一个新的可能性，如ChatGPT等具有零样本学习能力的模型。我们提供了一个利用简单系统实现混合对话机器人交互的案例研究，并讨论了从初始测试中获得的见解和初步指南。我们检查了ChatGPT追求多个相互关联的学习目标的能力，根据用户的特征（如文化、年龄和教育水平）来调整教育活动的能力，以及使用多种教育策略和对话风格的能力。尽管结果是令人鼓舞的，但由于受到维护的历史数据的限制，也面临着挑战。",
