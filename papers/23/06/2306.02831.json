    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了学习多任务、多模态的有向无环图（MM-DAG），这种图常见于复杂系统，如交通、制造和天气系统，变量是标量、向量和函数的混合。本文以交通拥堵分析为具体案例，其中一个交通路口通常被认为是一个 DAG。在多个交叉口组成的交通网络中，不同的交叉口只能观察到一些重叠和不同的变量。例如，一个信号ized的路口有关于交通灯的变量，而非信号ized的路口则没有。这促进了多任务设计：将每个DAG作为一个任务，MM-DAG试图共同学习多个DAG，以最大化它们的一致性和一致性。为此，我们创新性地提出了多模态回归，用于线性因果关系描述不同变量之间的关系。然后，我们开发了一种新的因果性差异（CD）度量及其的差分形式。",
