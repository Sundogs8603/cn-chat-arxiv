The primary objective would be performing PID tuning using reinforcement learning strategies. The secondary objective is to leverage the learnings from the first task to implement control for navigation by integrating with the lighthouse positioning system. Two approaches are considered for navigation, a discrete navigation problem using Deep Q-Learning with finite predefined motion primitives, and deep reinforcement learning for a continuous navigation approach. Simulations for RL training will be performed on gym-pybullet-drones, an open-source gym-based environment for reinforcement learning, and the RL implementations are provided by stable-baselines3",

    "translated_abstract": "本项目旨在探索经典控制算法（如PID）和现代强化学习算法之间的协同作用，以开发一种实用的控制机制来控制CrazyFlie 2.X四轴飞行器。主要目标是使用强化学习策略来执行PID调整，次要目标是利用第一个任务的经验，通过与灯塔定位系统集成实现导航控制。在导航方面考虑了两种方法：一种是使用预定义的有限运动基元进行深度Q学习的离散导航问题，另一种是使用深度强化学习进行连续导航。 RL训练的模拟将在gym-pybullet-drones上进行，该平台是一种基于强化学习的开源gym环境，并使用stable-baselines3提供RL实施。",
