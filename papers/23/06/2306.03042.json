    "abstract": "Environmental monitoring is crucial to our understanding of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. The availability of large-scale spatio-temporal data from sources such as sensors and satellites allows us to develop sophisticated models for forecasting and understanding key drivers. However, the data collected from sensors often contain missing values due to faulty equipment or maintenance issues. The missing values rarely occur simultaneously leading to data that are multivariate misaligned sparse time series. We propose two models that are capable of performing multivariate spatio-temporal forecasting while handling missing data naturally without the need for imputation. The first model is a transformer-based model, which we name SERT (Spatio-temporal Encoder Representations from Transformers).

    "translated_abstract": "环境监测对于我们理解气候变化、生物多样性丧失和污染等方面具有关键作用。来自传感器和卫星等数据源的大规模空间-时间数据的可用性使我们能够开发复杂的预测模型，并了解主要的驱动因素。但由于设备问题或维护问题，从传感器收集到的数据往往包含缺失值。缺失值很少同时发生，导致数据是多变量不对齐的稀疏时间序列数据。我们提出了两种模型，能够在处理缺失数据时自然地执行多变量空间-时间预测，而不需要插补。第一个模型是基于Transformer的模型，我们将其命名为SERT（来自Transformer的空间-时间编码表示）。第二个模型是一个更简单的模型，被命名为SST-ANN（稀疏空间-时间人工神经网络），能够提供可解释的结果。我们进行了大量实验...",
