    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，图数据的结构与嵌入空间的几何结构之间的对齐对于学习高质量的数据表示至关重要。欧氏空间和双曲空间的均匀几何允许使用最小的扭曲来表示具有均匀几何和拓扑特征，如网格和层次结构的图形。然而，现实世界的图形数据具有多种类型的几何和拓扑特征，需要更复杂的几何嵌入空间。在这项工作中，我们利用对称正定矩阵（SPD）的黎曼对称空间来构建图神经网络，以可靠地处理复杂的图形。为此，我们开发了一个创新的库，利用SPD gyrospace计算工具\\cite{lopez2021gyroSPD}实现了在SPD中五个流行图神经网络的构建模块。实验结果表明，我们在SPD中的图神经网络显著优于其他方法。",
