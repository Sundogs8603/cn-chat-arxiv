    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）在图导向任务中取得了显著的进展。然而，现实世界的图中不可避免地包含一定比例的异质节点，这挑战了经典GNN的同质性假设，并阻碍了其性能。现有研究大多数仍设计了具有异质节点和同质节点间共享权重的通用模型。尽管这些努力中包含了高阶信息和多通道架构，但往往效果不佳。少数研究尝试训练不同节点组的分离学习，但受到了不合适的分离度量和低效率的影响。本文首先提出了一种新的度量指标，称为邻域混淆（NC），以便更可靠地分离节点。我们观察到具有不同NC值的节点组在组内准确度和可视化嵌入上存在一定差异。这为基于邻域混淆的图卷积网络（NC-GCN）铺平了道路。",
