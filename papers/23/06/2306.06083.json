    "translated_abstract": "当自动语音识别（ASR）系统不能为所有人群子组织提供同样出色的性能时，就会出现公平性挑战。近年来，虽然在整体语音识别质量方面已经有很多改进，但并没有特别关注为系统无法表现良好的所有用户组推进公平和平等方面的改进。因此，ASR的公平性也是一个鲁棒性问题。同时，数据隐私在生产系统中也是首要问题。本文提出了一种隐私保护方法，可以在不使用元数据、邮政编码甚至不直接使用说话人或话语嵌入的情况下，提高端到端ASR的公平性和鲁棒性。我们使用在公共数据集上训练的说话人ID模型来提取话语级别的嵌入，然后以无监督的方式使用它们来创建声学聚类。我们在模型训练期间使用聚类ID而不是说话人话语嵌入作为额外的特征，这表现出了对所有人口统计学方面都有提高的效果。",
