    "translated_title": "Rec4Ad: 用于淘宝广告点击率预测的消除样本选择偏差的方法",
    "translated_abstract": "点击率（CTR）预测作为在线广告的一个基本组成部分，其训练常常基于广告展示和用户反馈。然而，这样的广告展示往往是有选择性的，由于其与推断分布不同，因此存在着样本选择偏差（SSB），影响模型的性能。现有研究主要采用样本再平衡技术来消除SSB，但其存在高方差且模型校准差的问题。另一些研究依赖于不足以训练工业模型的昂贵均匀数据。因此，探索一种无需均匀数据框架消除工业模型中的SSB是值得探讨的。根据淘宝等平台展示有机物品和赞助物品的混合结果，提出了一个名叫Rec4Ad的简单有效框架来消除广告的CTR预测中的SSB。具体来说，Rec4Ad利用推荐日志构建合成样本，使其模拟推断集的分布。然后，它将合成和原始样本组合以减少SSB。实验结果表明，Rec4Ad在模型性能和校准方面显著优于几种最先进的方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "Rec4Ad is proposed to mitigate the sample selection bias (SSB) in CTR prediction for ads on Taobao. It constructs synthetic samples to mimic the inference set distribution based on recommendation logs, and then combines them with original samples to reduce SSB. Experimental results show that Rec4Ad significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of model performance and calibration."
