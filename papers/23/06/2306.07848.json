    "abstract": "Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) has recently exhibited impressive success in diverse fields. In this paper, we propose GEmo-CLAP, a kind of efficient gender-attribute-enhanced CLAP model for speech emotion recognition (SER). Specifically, we first build an effective emotion CLAP model termed Emo-CLAP for SER, utilizing various self-supervised learning based pre-trained models. Then, considering the importance of the gender attribute in speech emotion modeling, two GEmo-CLAP approaches are further proposed to integrate the emotion and gender information of speech signals, forming more reasonable objectives. Extensive experiments conducted on the IEMOCAP corpus demonstrate that our proposed two GEmo-CLAP approaches consistently outperform the baseline Emo-CLAP with different pre-trained models, while also achieving superior recognition performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "对比语音-语言预训练（CLAP）最近在不同领域取得了惊人的成功。本文提出了一种名为GEmo-CLAP的高效性别属性增强CLAP模型，用于语音情感识别（SER）。具体而言，我们首先利用各种自监督学习的预训练模型构建了一种有效的情感CLAP模型（称为Emo-CLAP），用于SER。然后，考虑到在语音情感建模中性别属性的重要性，我们进一步提出了两种GEmo-CLAP方法，来整合语音信号的情感和性别信息，形成更合理的目标。在IEMOCAP语料库上进行的大量实验表明，我们提出的两种GEmo-CLAP方法始终优于基线Emo-CLAP模型（使用不同的预训练模型），同时与其他最先进的方法相比实现了更优越的识别性能。",
