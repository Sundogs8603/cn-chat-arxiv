    "translated_abstract": "现代科学问题通常是多学科的，需要整合来自不同学科的计算机模型，每个模型具有不同的功能复杂性，编程环境和计算时间。链接高斯过程（LGP）仿真通过将各个计算机模型的高斯过程仿真器集成到网络中的分而治之策略来解决这个挑战。然而，在LGP框架中，组件高斯过程仿真器的所需稳定性限制了其在许多实际应用中的适用性。在这项工作中，我们将计算模型网络概念化为一个具有部分隐藏层曝光的深高斯过程。我们开发了一种推断这些部分暴露的深度网络的方法，保留了LGP框架的一个关键优势，即每个模型都可以使用DGP分别仿真，然后链接在一起。我们在合成和实证示例中展示了我们的链接深度高斯过程模拟（LDGP）框架可以高效地仿真具有非稳态行为的复杂模型，并提高了预测的准确性，而相比之下，LGP框架的效果有所提升。",
