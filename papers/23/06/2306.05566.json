    "translated_abstract": "常微分方程（ODEs）的参数推断在许多科学应用中具有基本重要性。虽然ODE解通常由确定性算法近似，但有关概率求解器的新研究表明，它们通过更好地考虑数字误差产生更可靠的参数估计。然而，许多ODE系统对其参数值非常敏感。这在似然函数中产生了深层的局部最小值——现有的概率求解器尚未解决这个问题。在这里，我们展示了一种用于概率ODE解的贝叶斯滤波范式，通过数据自适应地学习嘈杂的ODE观察结果，可以显着降低参数的敏感性。我们的方法适用于具有部分未观测分量和任意非高斯噪声的ODEs。几个例子表明，它比现有的概率ODE求解器更精确，甚至在某些情况下比精确ODE似然函数更精确。",
