    "translated_abstract": "定向进化是一种改变蛋白质工程的分子生物学技术，可以通过创建具有期望特性和功能的蛋白质来实现。然而，由于巨大的突变空间，即突变空间随氨基酸数N呈$20^N$的指数增长，无法进行整个蛋白质库的深度突变扫描。这导致AI辅助的定向进化（AIDE）或AI辅助的蛋白质工程（AIPE）作为新兴研究领域的快速增长。借助先进的自然语言处理技术，包括长短期记忆、自编码器和Transformer，基于序列的嵌入已成为AIDE和AIPE中的主流方法。持久拉普拉斯人，在拓扑数据分析（TDA）中的一种新兴技术，为基于结构的嵌入提供了一个出色的选择。我们认为，一类持久拓扑拉普拉斯人（PTLs），包括持久拉普拉斯人、持久路径拉普拉斯人、持久量子化拉普拉斯人，可以推进基于拓扑和代数的AIDE和AIPE中的数学方法学习。",
