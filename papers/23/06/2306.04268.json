    "translated_abstract": "说话人分离是在语音流中回答“谁讲了什么”的任务。流水线系统依赖于语音分割来提取说话者的片段并实现强健的说话人分离。本文提出了一个通用框架，用于解决远程语音情况下的三个分割任务：语音活动检测(VAD)，重叠语音检测(OSD)和说话人更改检测(SCD)。在文献中，有少量研究调查了多麦克风远程语音场景。在这项工作中，我们提出了一组新的空间特征，这些特征基于循环谐波域(CH-DOA)中的到达方向估计。这些空间特征从多麦克风音频数据中提取，并与标准声学特征相结合。在AMI会议语料库上的实验证明，CH-DOA可以改善分割结果并且在麦克风停用的情况下仍然具有鲁棒性。",
