    "abstract": "Research in 3D semantic segmentation has been increasing performance metrics, like the IoU, by scaling model complexity and computational resources, leaving behind researchers and practitioners that (1) cannot access the necessary resources and (2) do need transparency on the model decision mechanisms. In this paper, we propose SCENE-Net, a low-resource white-box model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. SCENE-Net identifies signature shapes on the point cloud via group equivariant non-expansive operators (GENEOs), providing intrinsic geometric interpretability. Our training time on a laptop is 85~min, and our inference time is 20~ms. SCENE-Net has 11 trainable geometrical parameters and requires fewer data than black-box models. SCENE--Net offers robustness to noisy labeling and data imbalance and has comparable IoU to state-of-the-art methods. With this paper, we release a 40~000 Km labeled dataset of rural terrain point clouds and our code implementation.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，3D场景分割研究通过增加模型复杂度和计算资源来提高性能，如IoU，而忽略了那些既无法访问必要资源，又需要了解模型决策机制的研究者和从业者。本文提出了SCENE-Net，一种用于3D点云语义分割的低资源白盒模型。SCENE-Net通过同变非张量算子（GENEOs）在点云上识别特征形状，提供内在几何解释性，其在笔记本上的训练时间为85分钟，推理时间为20毫秒。SCENE-Net具有11个可训练的几何参数，比黑盒模型需要更少的数据。SCENE-Net具有对噪声标记和数据不平衡的鲁棒性，并具有与最先进方法相当的IoU。本文还发布了一个40,000公里标记的农村地形点云数据集和代码实现。",
