    "translated_abstract": "标记数据是现代机器学习应用程序的关键，但获取标记可能很昂贵。为了减缓这一成本，机器学习方法（如迁移学习、半监督学习和主动学习）旨在实现标签高效性：从相对较少的标记示例中实现高预测性能。虽然在实践中获得最佳的标签效率通常需要这些技术的组合，但现有的基准评估框架并没有捕捉到所有这些技术的协同组合。本文通过引入LabelBench解决了这个缺陷，这是一个新的计算效率高的综合性框架，用于联合评估多个标签高效学习技术。作为LabelBench的一个应用，我们引入了一种与半监督学习一起使用的最新主动学习方法的新基准，用于微调预训练的视觉转换器。我们的基准证明了比先前报告的更好的标签效率。",
