    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了所谓的功能性输入神经网络，定义在可能是无限维带权重空间上，其值也在可能是无限维的输出空间中。为此，我们使用一个加性族作为隐藏层映射，以及一个非线性激活函数应用于每个隐藏层。依靠带权重空间上的Stone-Weierstrass定理，我们可以证明连续函数的推广的全局普适逼近结果，超越了常规紧集逼近。这特别适用于通过功能性输入神经网络逼近（非先见之明的）路径空间函数。作为带权Stone-Weierstrass定理的进一步应用，我们证明了线性函数签名的全局普适逼近结果。我们还在这个设置中引入了高斯过程回归的观点，并展示了签名内核的再生核希尔伯特空间是某些高斯过程的Cameron-Martin空间。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了功能性输入神经网络，可以在带权重空间上完成全局函数逼近。这一方法适用于连续函数的推广，还可用于路径空间函数的逼近，同时也可以逼近线性函数签名。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes functional input neural networks that can achieve global function approximation on weighted spaces. The method applies to continuous functions beyond traditional compact-sets approximation, and can also approximate path space functions, linear functions of the signature. Additionally, the paper introduces the viewpoint of Gaussian process regression in this setting and proves the universality of linear functions of the signature."
