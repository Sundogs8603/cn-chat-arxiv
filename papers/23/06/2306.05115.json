    "translated_abstract": "全球监管机构通过《不公平商业行为指令》(UCPD)等工具来加强确保透明度社交媒体上的影响者营销，或者根据《联邦贸易委员会法案》第5条进行执行。然而，由于影响力市场的规模庞大，强制实施这些义务一直是一个难题。检测赞助内容的任务旨在实现对此类规定的监控和执行。当前这方面的研究主要将问题框架为一项机器学习任务，着重于开发能够在检测广告时达到高分类性能的模型。这些机器学习任务依赖于人类数据注释来提供基础真实信息。然而，注释者之间的一致性通常很低，导致标签不一致，从而影响模型的可靠性。我们提出了一种新方法，使用语言模型ChatGPT生成模型预测的解释，以提高人工标注者的准确度和一致性，从而改善赞助内容的检测。",
