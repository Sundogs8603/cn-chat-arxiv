    "translated_abstract": "基于嵌入式神经网络的信息检索已经成为解决尾查询中经常出现的语义差距问题的普遍方法。与此同时，热门查询通常缺乏上下文，有广泛的意图，用户历史互动的附加上下文有助于解决问题。本文介绍了我们解决语义差距问题的新方法，以及一种用于个性化语义检索的端到端训练模型。我们建议学习一种统一的嵌入模型，包括基于图形、变压器和术语的嵌入，同时分享了我们的设计选择，以在性能和效率之间实现最佳权衡。我们分享了特征工程、硬负采样策略和变压器模型的应用方面的经验教训，包括用于提高搜索相关性和部署此类模型的一种新颖的预训练策略和其他技巧。我们的个性化检索模型显着提高了整体搜索体验。",
