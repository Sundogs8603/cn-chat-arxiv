    "translated_abstract": "能源供应对于经济价值的生产是必要的。然而，传统上认为神秘的“看不见的手”统治着经济估值。物理学家长期以来提出了与能源成本有关的经济估值理论，通过输入输出能量分析，在国家层面上显示了能源消耗与经济产出之间的总体相关性。然而，由于精确能量分析的困难和高度复杂的实际市场，尚未找到将能源成本与单个商品销售价格直接联系起来的决定性证据。过去一个世纪，美国金属市场累积了大量的价格数据，这为我们提供了首次机会，以量化的方式检验直接的能源价值相关性。通过分析65种纯化学元素（主要是金属）的市场价格数据，相对于从天然矿石中提炼它们的总能量消耗，我们提供了第一个定量证据，表明固有的能源成本作为统治经济估值的“看不见的手”。我们的结果显示出销售价格与其精炼能源成本成正比，比例指数为0.82±0.09，相关系数为0.83。这一发现表明，能源成本理论为理解经济估值提供了一个基本框架，并可能对有关能源转型和可持续发展的政策决策产生影响。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study provides the first quantitative evidence that the intrinsic energy cost serves as the \"invisible hand\" governing economic valuation by analyzing the market price data of 65 purified chemical elements relative to the total energy consumption for refining them from naturally occurring ores in the US metal market. This finding suggests that the energy cost theory provides a fundamental framework for understanding economic valuation and may have implications for policy decisions regarding energy transition and sustainable development."
