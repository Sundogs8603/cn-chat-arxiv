    "translated_abstract": "现有的情感-原因对抽取(ECPE)任务遗憾地忽略了情感类型和原因类型的提取，而这些细粒度的元信息在实际应用中可能非常有用，例如聊天机器人和共情对话生成。此外，当前的ECPE仅限于单个文本片段的场景，而忽略了应该具有更现实价值的对话级别的研究。在本文中，我们通过更广泛的定义和场景扩展了ECPE任务，提出了一个新的任务：对话中的情感-原因四元组抽取(ECQED)，需要检测情感-原因话语对和情感和原因类型。我们提出了基于结构和语义异构图以及平行标记方案的ECQED模型，这提高了有效地结合对话上下文结构的能力，同时解决了令人困扰的重叠四元组问题。通过实验，我们表明，引入细粒度情感和原因检测并考虑对话上下文对于实现ECQED任务的更好效果都至关重要。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new task, Emotion-Cause Quadruple Extraction in Dialogs (ECQED), which requires detecting emotion-cause utterance pairs and emotion and cause types in a dialog context. By introducing fine-grained emotion and cause detection and considering the dialog context, the performance of the task is effectively improved."
