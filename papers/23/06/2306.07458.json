    "abstract": "In settings where users are both time-pressured and need high accuracy, such as doctors working in Emergency Rooms, we want to provide AI assistance that both increases accuracy and reduces time. However, different types of AI assistance have different benefits: some reduce time taken while increasing overreliance on AI, while others do the opposite. We therefore want to adapt what AI assistance we show depending on various properties (of the question and of the user) in order to best tradeoff our two objectives. We introduce a study where users have to prescribe medicines to aliens, and use it to explore the potential for adapting AI assistance. We find evidence that it is beneficial to adapt our AI assistance depending on the question, leading to good tradeoffs between time taken and accuracy. Future work would consider machine-learning algorithms (such as reinforcement learning) to automatically adapt quickly.",

    "translated_abstract": "在需要高准确性但同时时间又紧迫的环境下，例如在急诊室工作的医生，我们希望提供人工智能辅助，既能提高准确性又能减少时间。但是，不同类型的人工智能功能带来的好处是不同的：一些能够减少时间，但会增加对人工智能的过度依赖，而其他一些则相反。因此，我们希望根据问题和用户的各种属性（如知识水平）来自适应地展示人工智能辅助，以便在准确性和时间性之间做出最佳权衡。我们通过一个用户需要为外星人开药方的研究来探索自适应AI辅助的潜力。我们发现根据问题自适应AI辅助是有益的，可以达到时间和准确性的良好平衡。未来的研究将考虑使用机器学习算法（如强化学习）来实现快速自适应。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study explores adaptive interventions for AI-assisted human decision making, which can both increase accuracy and reduce time, by adapting the AI assistance shown depending on various properties of the question and the user. The research finds good tradeoffs between time and accuracy and suggests future work could consider using machine-learning algorithms to enable fast adaptation."
