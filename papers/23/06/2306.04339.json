    "translated_abstract": "动态增强磁共振成像 (DCE-MRI) 可以提供关于血管通透性和组织灌注的药代动力学参数信息。然而，传统的药代动力学参数估计方法涉及拟合示踪剂动力学模型，由于噪声动脉输入函数 (AIF) 的测量常常导致计算复杂性和低准确性。虽然一些深度学习方法已被提出来解决这些挑战，但大部分现有的方法依赖于有标签的 DCE-MRI 和已标注的药代动力学参数图。这依赖于标签数据会导致显著的时间和资源限制，可能会引入标签噪声，使得监督学习方法经常不实用。为了解决这些限制，我们在这里提出了一种新颖的非配对深度学习方法，用物理驱动的 CycleGAN 方法估计药代动力学参数和 AIF。我们提出的 CycleGAN 框架基于自对抗学习，通过学习两个不同分布之间的映射，可以在没有配对数据的情况下对药代动力学参数进行估计。",
