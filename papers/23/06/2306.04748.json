    "translated_abstract": "帕金森病（PD）是一种常见的神经退行性疾病，患者表现多种多样，但对其潜在原因和症状进展的了解还很有限。帕金森进展标志物计划（PPMI）收集了多个患者群的详细纵向数据以确定生物标志物并辅助干预方法的制定。尽管已经有超过110个机器学习研究使用PPMI数据库，但大部分研究仅聚焦于监督模型用于诊断预测，限制了对患者多样性和进展的认识。本文通过结合监督和无监督的机器学习方法来鉴别亚型，准确预测帕金森患者疾病进程。本研究利用PPMI数据库中5年的纵向数据并在之前研究的基础上，整合无监督的病人聚类和病人当前和未来症状的预测。我们的方法鉴别出三个不同的帕金森病亚型，并为个体患者生成个性化的症状进展预测。这种方法提高了预测疾病进展的准确性，帮助制定个性化干预方法并改善患者的预后。",
