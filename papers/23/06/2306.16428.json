In a previous work we presented a novel tensor-based system identification framework to ease the computational burden of tensor-only architectures while still being able to achieve exceptionally good performance.

In this work we therefore derive two new architectures to allow the processing of complex-valued signals, and show that these extensions are able to surpass the trivial, complex-valued extension of the original architecture in terms of performance, while only requiring a slight overhead in computational resources to allow for complex-valued operations.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）和基于张量的方法在过去几十年中一直受到科学界的重大关注。在之前的工作中，我们提出了一个新颖的基于张量的系统识别框架，以减轻仅使用张量的架构的计算负担，同时仍能实现出色的性能。然而，该方法只允许处理实数问题，因此不能直接应用于处理复数系统的广泛范围的信号处理和通信问题。因此，在这项工作中，我们推导出两种新的架构，以允许处理复数信号，并且证明这些扩展能够在性能方面超越原始架构的平凡的复数扩展，同时只需要稍微增加计算资源来允许复数运算。",
