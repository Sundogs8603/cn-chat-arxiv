    "translated_abstract": "高级持久性威胁(APTs)具有多阶段渗透、高度定制化意图和规避策略等新颖特征。APTs的防御需要融合多维网络威胁情报数据来识别攻击意图，并通过基于数据驱动的机器学习进行有效的知识发现策略以识别实体关系。然而，数据驱动的机器学习缺乏对新的或未知样本的泛化能力，降低了防御模型的准确性和实用性。此外，将这些APTs防御模型私有部署在异构环境中和各种网络设备上，需要在上下文感知方面进行重大投入（例如已知攻击实体、连续的网络状态和当前的安全策略）。本文提出了一种面向高级持久性威胁的上下文感知防御的少样本多领域知识重装(FMKR)方案。通过在不同网络域生成多个小任务，完成多领域知识重新装备，从而提升防御性能。",
