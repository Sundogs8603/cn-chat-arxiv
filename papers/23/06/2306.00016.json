    "translated_abstract": "离散选择模型（DCM）被广泛应用于旅行需求分析中，作为一种强大的理论计量框架来理解和预测选择行为。DCM是随机效用模型（RUM），其主要优点是可解释性。然而，估计这些模型的核心要求是先验指定相关的效用函数，使其对模型人员的主观信念敏感。最近，机器学习（ML）方法已经成为学习DCM中未观测到的非线性关系的一种有前途的方法。然而，ML模型被认为是“黑盒子”，可能与预期的关系不符。本文提出了一个框架，通过约束支持开发并将领域知识和先验信念纳入可解释模型中，以扩展数据驱动方法在DCM中的潜力。所提出的框架包括代表所需关系的伪数据样本和将DCM转换为具有软约束的深度神经网络（DNN）的对数似然函数。由此得到的模型既具有可解释性，又保留了RUM的优点和DNNs的灵活性。实验结果表明，所提出的方法优于现有的最先进方法。",
