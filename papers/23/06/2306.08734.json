    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks comprise many operational layers, such as dense or convolutional layers, which are often collected into blocks. In this work, we introduce a new, wavelet-transform-based network architecture that we call the multi-resolution perceptron: by adding a pooling layer, we create a new network block, the WavPool. The first step of the multi-resolution perceptron is transforming the data into its multi-resolution decomposition form by convolving the input data with filters of fixed coefficients but increasing size. Following image processing techniques, we are able to make scale and spatial information simultaneously accessible to the network without increasing the size of the data vector. WavPool outperforms a similar multilayer perceptron while using fewer parameters, and outperforms a comparable convolutional neural network by ~ 10% on relative accuracy on CIFAR-10.",

    "translated_abstract": "现代深度神经网络由许多操作层组成，例如稠密层或卷积层，通常被收集成块。在本文中，我们介绍了一种基于小波变换的新型网络架构，称为多分辨率感知器：通过添加池化层，我们创建了一个新的网络模块，WavPool。多分辨率感知器的第一步是通过将输入数据与固定系数但不断增加的滤波器卷积来将数据转换为其多分辨率分解形式。遵循图像处理技术，我们能够使比例和空间信息同时可访问于网络，而不增加数据向量的大小。WavPool在使用更少的参数时优于类似的多层感知器，并且在CIFAR-10上以相对准确度的 ~ 10％优于可比卷积神经网络。",
