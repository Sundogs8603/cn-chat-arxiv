    "translated_abstract": "RVL-CDIP基准已广泛用于衡量文件分类任务的性能。尽管其使用广泛，但我们揭示了RVL-CDIP基准的几个不良特征，包括（1）大量的标签噪声，我们估计为8.1％（每个文档类别介于1.6％到16.9％不等）;（2）存在许多不明确或多标签文档;（3）测试和训练分裂之间存在巨大重叠，这可能会夸大模型性能指标;和（4）存在敏感的可识别个人身份信息，如美国社会安全号码（SSN）。我们认为使用RVL-CDIP进行基准测试存在风险，因为其有限的范围，存在错误（现代先进模型现在可以实现我们估计的标签错误率内的准确性错误率），缺乏多样性，不够理想用于基准测试。我们进一步倡导创建新的文件分类基准，并提供其构建和评估的建议指南。",
