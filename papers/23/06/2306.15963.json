    "translated_abstract": "图数据增强已被证明对于增强图神经网络（GNN）的泛化能力和鲁棒性在图级分类方面是有效的。然而，现有的方法主要集中在独立地增强图信号空间和图结构空间，忽视了它们的共同作用。本文通过将问题形式化为一个最优传输问题，旨在找到一种匹配图之间节点的最优策略，考虑图结构和信号之间的相互作用，以解决这个限制。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的图mixup算法，称为FGWMixup，它利用融合Gromov-Wasserstein（FGW）度量空间来识别源图的“中点”。为了提高我们方法的可扩展性，我们引入了一个放松的FGW求解器，通过将收敛速度从O(t^-1)加速到O(t^-2)，提高了FGWMixup的收敛速度。在五个数据集上进行了大量实验证明了我们的方法的有效性。",
