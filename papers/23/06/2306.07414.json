Data augmentation aims to increase the quantity of data that is available to train the system. In machine translation, majority of the language pairs around the world are considered low resource because they have little parallel data available and the quality of neural machine translation (NMT) systems depend a lot on the availability of sizable parallel corpora. We study and apply three simple data augmentation techniques popularly used in text classification tasks; synonym replacement, random insertion and contextual data augmentation and compare their performance with baseline neural machine translation for English-Swahili (En-Sw) datasets.

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们研究了将文本数据扩充任务应用于低资源机器翻译的影响。近年来，人们开始关注如何为资源有限的语种训练机器翻译系统，其中一种流行的方法是使用数据扩充技术。数据扩充旨在增加可用于训练系统的数据量。在机器翻译中，全球大多数语言对被认为是低资源语种，因为它们可用的平行数据很少，而神经机器翻译（NMT）系统的质量很大程度上取决于可用的庞大平行语料库。我们研究并应用了三种简单的数据扩充技术，这些技术在文本分类任务中广泛使用：同义词替换、随机插入和上下文数据扩增，并将它们与英斯瓦希里（En-Sw）数据集的基线神经机器翻译性能进行比较。我们还使用BLEU、ChrF和....",
