    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种名为LyricWhiz的鲁棒、多语言、零射击的自动歌词转录方法，该方法在各种歌词转录数据集上实现了最先进的性能，即使在具有挑战性的流派如摇滚和金属中也是如此。我们的全新、无需训练的方法利用了Whisper，一种弱监督的鲁棒语音识别模型，以及GPT-4，当今最性能卓越的基于聊天的大型语言模型。在该方法中，Whisper充当“耳朵”，负责转录语音，而GPT-4则作为“大脑”，作为一种具有强大性能的上下文输出选择和校正的注释器。我们的实验结果表明，与现有方法相比，LyricWhiz在英语中显著降低了词错误率，并且可以有效地转录多种语言的歌词。此外，我们使用LyricWhiz创建了第一个具有CC-BY-NC-SA版权许可的公开可用的大规模多语言歌词转录数据集，基于MTG-Jamendo，并提供了h",
