    "abstract": "Spaces with locally varying scale of measurement, like multidimensional structures with differently scaled dimensions, are pretty common in statistics and machine learning. Nevertheless, it is still understood as an open question how to exploit the entire information encoded in them properly. We address this problem by considering an order based on (sets of) expectations of random variables mapping into such non-standard spaces. This order contains stochastic dominance and expectation order as extreme cases when no, or respectively perfect, cardinal structure is given. We derive a (regularized) statistical test for our proposed generalized stochastic dominance (GSD) order, operationalize it by linear optimization, and robustify it by imprecise probability models. Our findings are illustrated with data from multidimensional poverty measurement, finance, and medicine.",

    "translated_abstract": "具有局部可变测量尺度的空间，在统计学和机器学习中是相当普遍的，比如说，具有不同缩放维度的多维结构。然而，如何正确地利用这些空间中编码的全部信息，仍然被认为是一个开放性问题。我们通过考虑一个基于随机变量期望的（集合）偏序关系来解决这个问题，这些随机变量映射到这些非标准空间中。当没有或完全的基数结构时，这个偏序关系包含随机优势和期望顺序作为极端情况。我们通过线性优化导出了一个适用于我们提出的广义随机优势（GSD）顺序的（正则化的）统计检验，并通过不精确概率模型使其更为鲁棒。我们的发现用多维贫困度量、金融和医学数据进行说明。",
