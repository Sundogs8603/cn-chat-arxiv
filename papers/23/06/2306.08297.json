    "abstract": "In spring 2022, the German federal government agreed on a set of policy measures that aimed at reducing households' financial burden resulting from a recent price increase, especially in energy and mobility. These included among others, a nationwide public transport ticket for 9~Euro per month for three months in June, July, and August 2022. In transport policy research this is an almost unprecedented behavioral experiment. It allows us to study not only behavioral responses in mode choice and induced demand but also to assess the effectiveness of these instruments. We observe this natural experiment with a three-wave survey and a smartphone-based travel diary with passive tracking on an initial sample of 2,261 participants with a focus on the Munich metropolitan region. This area is chosen as it offers a variety of mode options with a dense and far-reaching public transport network that even provides good access to many leisure destinations. The app has been providing data from 756 pa",

    "translated_title": "2022年德国全国性的旅行实验：每月9欧元的公共交通——关于一项实证研究的首次发现",
    "translated_abstract": "2022年春季，德国联邦政府同意了一系列旨在减轻家庭财务负担的政策措施，尤其是针对近期能源和交通价格上涨的问题。其中之一是在2022年6月、7月和8月三个月期间为每月9欧元提供全国性公共交通票。这是交通政策研究中几乎前所未有的行为实验。这不仅允许我们研究出行方式的行为响应和诱导需求，还可以评估这些工具的有效性。我们使用三波调查和基于智能手机的行程日记，并对慕尼黑大都会区的2,261名参与者进行重点观测。选择该地区是因为它提供了各种出行方式，拥有密集和广泛的公共交通网络，甚至可以提供良好的到达许多休闲目的地的方式。该应用程序提供了756个实际参与者的数据。",
    "tldr": "2022年夏季，德国政府开展了一项实验，鼓励居民在三个月内选择支付每月9欧元的全国公共交通票，以缓解家庭财务压力。这是一项交通政策研究中前所未有的大规模行为实验，旨在研究交通出行方式和工具的有效性。",
    "en_tdlr": "In the summer of 2022, the German government conducted an experiment to encourage residents to choose a nationwide public transport ticket for 9 euros per month for three months, in order to alleviate household financial burden. This unprecedented large-scale behavioral experiment in transportation policy research aims to study the effectiveness of transportation modes and tools."
