    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在为科技作者提供科技性判断，划分段落，以及提供润色建议的辅助功能。首先，我们提出了一个回归模型，该模型是根据从同行评审的科技论文和非科技文本中提取的科技句子语料训练得到的，用于评估一个句子的科学性。我们研究了方程式和引文对该评分的影响，以测试该模型是否存在偏见。其次，我们创建了一个映射，将AI和机器学习标准论文布局中的标题映射到一个最可能的段落，以将句子分类到其所属的段落中。我们研究了上下文对段落分类性能的影响。最后，我们提出了一个润色器，它为给定的句子提供了替代方案，包括单词替换、添加语句和结构变化，以改善写作风格。我们在句子级别对各种大型语言模型进行了训练。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a fine-tuning method for language models to support scientific writing, including functions such as evaluating sentence scientificness, segmenting paragraphs, and providing paraphrasing suggestions. The model's biases are tested by investigating the impact of equations and citations, and the context is analyzed to improve section classification. A paraphraser is also proposed to improve writing style by suggesting alternatives for sentences. Various large language models are trained at the sentence level."
