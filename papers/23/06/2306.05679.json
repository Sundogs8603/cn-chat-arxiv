    "translated_abstract": "在基因组学、蛋白质组学和神经科学等应用中，具有网络辅助信息的监督学习问题经常出现。本文中，我们首次研究了具有网络辅助信息的高维线性回归中的贝叶斯最优学习问题。为此，我们首先引入了一个简单的生成模型（称为Reg-Graph模型），通过一组共同的潜在参数为监督数据和观测到的网络设定了一个联合分布。接下来，我们介绍了一种基于近似消息传递（AMP）的迭代算法，在非常一般的条件下可证明是贝叶斯最优的。此外，我们对潜在信号和观测到的数据之间的极限互信息进行了表征，从而精确量化了网络辅助信息在回归问题中的统计影响。我们对模拟数据和实际数据的实验表明，我们的方法优于现有的几种网络辅助回归方法。",
