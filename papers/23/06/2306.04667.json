    "translated_abstract": "蛋白质在生物体中扮演着非常重要的角色，因此，开发用于蛋白质表示的高效计算方法对推进大规模生物研究至关重要。目前，大多数方法难以高效集成蛋白质序列和结构中包含的大量信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的框架，通过学习保持蛋白质图结构距离的编码器函数，在几何向量空间中嵌入蛋白质图。利用图神经网络（GNN）和大型语言模型（LLM），提出的框架生成具有结构和序列感知能力的蛋白质表示。我们证明了我们的嵌入在比较蛋白质结构的任务中取得了成功，同时与基于结构对齐的传统方法相比，提供了显着加速。我们的框架在蛋白质结构分类任务中取得了卓越的结果；特别是，我们的方法可以在大规模蛋白质数据集上进行训练。",
