    "translated_abstract": "最近的临床研究描述了一部分在放射治疗开始前表现出快速早期进展（REP）的脑胶质瘤患者。目前的文献迄今为止仅描述了这种人群的临床病理特征。据我们所知，本研究是首次利用传统放射解剖学、复杂多分辨率分形纹理特征和不同分子特征（MGMT、IDH突变）作为诊断和预后工具，使用计算和统计建模方法预测来自非REP病例的REP患者的潜力。分析了70名患者的放射规划T1增强（T1C）MRI序列。经过1000次迭代的5折交叉验证，集成方法提供了0.793的AUC，标准偏差为0.082，用于REP和非REP分类。此外，在依赖性截标的基础上，基于Copula模型的建模（其中一部分患者可能在死亡前未跟踪）确定了生存概率的显著特征（p值<0.05）。",
