    "translated_abstract": "鉴于反应堆的恶劣运行条件和物理限制，核应用不能将物理资产配备大量传感器。因此，需要仔细确定在给定的空间限制内传感器的放置位置，以实现反应堆流场的重建和核数字孪生体的创建。我们开发了一种数据驱动的技术，将约束条件整合到传感器放置优化过程中，旨在最小化重建误差。我们的方法采用贪心算法，在网格上优化传感器位置，遵循用户定义的约束条件。我们通过计算选择传感器位置的所有可能配置并将其与我们的方法得出的解进行比较，证明了我们算法的近乎最优性。我们发现，我们的方法可以显著提高性能，且所需传感器数量极少，因此为核数字孪生体的创建提供了更为经济高效的解决方案。",
