    "translated_abstract": "逆流自发渗透（COUCSI）是一种多孔材料中的过程，其中润湿相取代了非润湿相的位置。本文首次探讨了物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在解决早期（ET）和晚期（LT）COUCSI问题中的应用。同时，我们还研究了改变变量技术以改进PINNs的性能。我们通过改变自变量将COUCSI问题分别用XT-，XY-和Z-三种等效形式进行描述：第一个描述了饱和度作为规范化位置X和时间T的函数;第二个描述了X和Y=T^0.5作为函数的饱和度;第三个作为Z=X/T^0.5的唯一函数（仅在ET下有效）。该PINN模型使用前馈神经网络生成，并基于最小化加权损失函数进行训练，包括物理信息丢失项和与初始边界条件相对应的项。没有合成或实验数据被调用。",
