    "abstract": "Policy evaluation in empirical microeconomics has been focusing on estimating the average treatment effect and more recently the heterogeneous treatment effects, often relying on the unconfoundedness assumption. We propose a method based on the interactive fixed effects model to estimate treatment effects at the individual level, which allows both the treatment assignment and the potential outcomes to be correlated with the unobserved individual characteristics. This method is suitable for panel datasets where multiple related outcomes are observed for a large number of individuals over a small number of time periods. Monte Carlo simulations show that our method outperforms related methods. To illustrate our method, we provide an example of estimating the effect of health insurance coverage on individual usage of hospital emergency departments using the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment data.",

    "translated_abstract": "在实证微观经济学中，政策评估一直关注于估计平均处理效应以及更近期的异质处理效应，通常依赖于无混杂假设。我们提出了一种基于交互固定效应模型的方法，用于估计个体层面的处理效应，允许处理分配和潜在结果与未观察到的个体特征相关。该方法适用于面板数据集，其中有大量个体在少数时间段内观察到多个相关结果。蒙特卡罗模拟表明，我们的方法优于相关方法。为了说明我们的方法，我们提供了一个利用俄勒冈州医疗保险实验数据估计医保覆盖对个人急诊使用的影响的示例。",
