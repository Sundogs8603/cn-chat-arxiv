    "translated_abstract": "深度学习，特别是深度神经网络（DNN），现今在许多场合广泛使用，包括自动驾驶等安全关键应用。在这种情况下，除了能源效率和性能外，可靠性也扮演着至关重要的角色，因为系统故障可能会危及人类生命。作为任何其他设备一样，运行DNN的硬件架构的可靠性必须经过评估，通常是通过昂贵的故障注入活动。本文研究了DNN加速器的逼近和容错能力。我们建议使用近似（AxC）算术电路，以在硬件上敏捷地模拟错误，而无需在DNN上执行故障注入。为了允许快速评估AxC DNN，我们开发了一个高效的基于GPU的模拟框架。此外，我们通过检查网络中的故障传播和掩蔽，提出了一种精细的容错分析。",
