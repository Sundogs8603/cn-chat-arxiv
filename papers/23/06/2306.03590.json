    "translated_abstract": "在协方差矩阵估计中，找到合适的模型和有效的估计方法是一项挑战。文献中通常采用两种方法，一种是对协方差矩阵或其逆施加线性约束，另一种是考虑施加在协方差矩阵的矩阵对数上的线性约束。本文提出了一个通用的线性约束协方差矩阵变换的框架，包括上述例子。我们提出的估计方法解决了一个凸问题，并产生了一个M估计量，允许相对简单的渐近性和有限样本分析。在开发了一般理论之后，我们集中在建模相关矩阵和稀疏性方面。我们的几何洞察力允许我们扩展协方差矩阵建模中的一些最新结果。这包括提供相关矩阵空间的无限制参数化，这是一种替代利用变换的最新结果。我们还展示了如何对协方差矩阵的Cholesky因子施加稀疏性限制，这与现有方法不同。",

The focus is on modeling correlation matrices and sparsity. The paper also extends recent results in covariance matrix modeling by providing unrestricted parametrizations of the space of correlation matrices and showing how to impose sparsity restrictions on the Cholesky factor of the covariance matrix."
