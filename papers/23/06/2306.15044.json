    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是一种保护隐私的机器学习技术，但受到可扩展性的限制。这种限制主要来自于中央参数服务器的互联网连接和内存容量，以及模型聚合函数的复杂性。近年来，去中心化学习作为联邦学习的一种有前景的替代方案逐渐兴起。这种新技术通过将模型聚合分散到所有参与节点中，消除了对中央参数服务器的需求。许多研究已经针对提高联邦学习对毒化攻击和Sybil攻击的鲁棒性进行了研究，而去中心化学习的鲁棒性仍然鲜有研究。这个研究空白是本研究的主要动机，我们的目标是提高去中心化学习的Sybil毒化鲁棒性。我们提出了SybilWall，这是一种专注于增强去中心化学习对Sybil攻击的鲁棒性的创新算法。",
