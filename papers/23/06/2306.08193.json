    "abstract": "Despite its centrality in the philosophy of cognitive science, there has been little prior philosophical work engaging with the notion of representation in contemporary NLP practice. This paper attempts to fill that lacuna: drawing on ideas from cognitive science, I introduce a framework for evaluating the representational claims made about components of neural NLP models, proposing three criteria with which to evaluate whether a component of a model represents a property and operationalising these criteria using probing classifiers, a popular analysis technique in NLP (and deep learning more broadly).  The project of operationalising a philosophically-informed notion of representation should be of interest to both philosophers of science and NLP practitioners. It affords philosophers a novel testing-ground for claims about the nature of representation, and helps NLPers organise the large literature on probing experiments, suggesting novel avenues for empirical research.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管“表示”在认知科学哲学中具有核心地位，但在当代自然语言处理实践中，几乎没有哲学领域的先前研究与之涉及。本文旨在填补这一空白：结合认知科学的思想，提出了一个框架来评估神经自然语言处理模型组件所作出的表示性声明，并提出三个评估组件是否表示属性的标准，并使用探测分类器来实现这些标准的操作化，探测分类器是NLP（和更广泛的深度学习）中流行的分析技术。操作化一个在哲学上受到启发的“表示”概念的项目应该引起科学哲学家和自然语言处理实践者的兴趣。对于哲学家来说，这提供了一个测试有关表示的本质的论据的新颖场地，并帮助NLPers组织有关探测实验的大量文献，提出了新的经验研究方向。",
