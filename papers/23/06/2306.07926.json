    "abstract": "Unsupervised speech recognition (ASR-U) is the problem of learning automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems from unpaired speech-only and text-only corpora. While various algorithms exist to solve this problem, a theoretical framework is missing from studying their properties and addressing such issues as sensitivity to hyperparameters and training instability. In this paper, we proposed a general theoretical framework to study the properties of ASR-U systems based on random matrix theory and the theory of neural tangent kernels. Such a framework allows us to prove various learnability conditions and sample complexity bounds of ASR-U. Extensive ASR-U experiments on synthetic languages with three classes of transition graphs provide strong empirical evidence for our theory (code available at cactuswiththoughts/UnsupASRTheory.git).",

    "translated_abstract": "无监督语音识别问题指的是从未配对的含有语音和文本的语料库中学习自动语音识别（ASR）系统。虽然存在各种算法来解决这个问题，但缺乏一个理论框架来研究其属性，并解决如超参数敏感性和训练不稳定性等问题。本文提出了一种通用的理论框架，以随机矩阵理论和神经切向核理论为基础，研究ASR-U系统的属性。这样的框架使我们能够证明ASR-U的各种可学习性条件和样本复杂性边界。针对有三类转移图的合成语言的广泛ASR-U实验为我们的理论提供了强有力的实证证据（代码可在cactuswiththoughts / UnsupASRTheory.git中获得）。",
