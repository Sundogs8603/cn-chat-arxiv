    "abstract": "We introduce Inference-Time Intervention (ITI), a technique designed to enhance the truthfulness of large language models (LLMs). ITI operates by shifting model activations during inference, following a set of directions across a limited number of attention heads. This intervention significantly improves the performance of LLaMA models on the TruthfulQA benchmark. On an instruction-finetuned LLaMA called Alpaca, ITI improves its truthfulness from 32.5% to 65.1%. We identify a tradeoff between truthfulness and helpfulness and demonstrate how to balance it by tuning the intervention strength. ITI is minimally invasive and computationally inexpensive. Moreover, the technique is data efficient: while approaches like RLHF require extensive annotations, ITI locates truthful directions using only few hundred examples. Our findings suggest that LLMs may have an internal representation of the likelihood of something being true, even as they produce falsehoods on the surface.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了推理时间干预（ITI）技术，旨在增强大型语言模型（LLMs）的真实性。ITI通过在推理过程中沿着一组方向移动模型激活，跨越有限数量的注意力头。这种干预显着提高了LLaMA模型在TruthfulQA基准上的表现。在指令微调的LLaMA Alpaca上，ITI将其真实性从32.5％提高到65.1％。我们确定了真实性和可用性之间的权衡，并演示了如何通过调整干预强度来平衡它。ITI 取得了最低程度的干扰且计算廉价。此外，该技术在数据效率上表现优异：虽然像RLHF这样的方法需要广泛注释，但是ITI仅使用了几百个例子就能定位真实的方向。我们的研究结果表明，LLMs可能具有某种内部表示方法来表示某事是真实的可能性，即使它们在表面上产生了虚假的结果。",
