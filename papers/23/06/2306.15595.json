    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种位置插值（PI）方法，可以在最小微调的情况下将RoPE-based预训练语言模型（如LLaMA模型）的上下文窗口大小扩展到最多32768，并且在需要长上下文的各种任务（包括密钥检索、语言建模和长篇文档摘要等）上展现出良好的实证结果。同时，通过位置插值扩展的模型在原始上下文窗口内的任务中相对保持良好的质量。为了实现这一目标，位置插值线性地降低输入位置索引的大小，以匹配原始的上下文窗口大小，而不是超过训练时上下文长度，这可能会导致严重的高注意力分数，完全破坏自注意机制。我们的理论研究表明，插值的上界至少是推断的上界的$\\sim 600 \\times$要小，进一步证明了其稳定性。",
