Because employing customer service agents is expensive, many companies are turning to NLP that assists human agents by auto-generating responses that can be used directly or with modifications. Large Language Models (LLMs) are a natural fit for this use case; however, their efficacy must be balanced with the cost of training and serving them. This paper assesses the practical cost and impact of LLMs for the enterprise as a function of the usefulness of the responses that they generate. We present a cost framework for evaluating an NLP model's utility for this use case and apply it to a single brand as a case study in the context of an existing agent assistance product. We compare three strategies for specializing an LLM - prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and knowledge distillation - using feedback from the brand's customer service agents. We find that the usability of a model's responses can make up for a large difference in in",

    "translated_abstract": "通过聊天联系客户服务是一种常见做法。由于雇用客服代理商是昂贵的，许多公司正在转向NLP，通过自动生成可直接使用或修改的响应来协助人类代理商。大型语言模型（LLMs）是这种情况的自然选择；然而，它们的功效必须与训练和服务成本相平衡。本文评估了LLMs在企业中作为响应生成工具可实现的实际成本和影响。我们提出了一个成本框架，用于评估NLP模型在这种情况下的效用，并将其应用于单个品牌作为现有代理协助产品背景下的案例研究。我们使用品牌客户服务代理的反馈比较了三种专门化LLM的策略-提示工程、微调和知识蒸馏。我们发现，模型响应的可用性可以弥补巨大的成本差异。",
