    "translated_abstract": "可控制文本生成是自然语言生成中具有挑战性和意义重大的领域。尤其是诗歌生成是一个典型的领域，对文本生成有着明确定义和严格的条件，是评估当前方法学的理想实验场。过去的研究成功地控制了诗歌生成的语义或韵律方面，但同时解决这两个方面仍然是一个挑战。在本文中，我们首次使用扩散模型来生成十四行诗和中国宋词，以应对这些挑战。就语义而言，我们的PoetryDiffusion模型基于扩散模型生成完整的句子或诗歌，全面考虑句子信息的整体性。这种方法增强了语义表达，使其与自回归模型和大型语言模型有所区别。就韵律控制而言，扩散生成和其约束控制模块的分离特性使我们能够灵活地控制韵律。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了PoetryDiffusion模型，利用扩散模型生成诗歌，同时考虑了语义和韵律方面的控制，具有较高的实用性和创新性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces the PoetryDiffusion model, which utilizes the Diffusion model to generate poetry with joint semantic and metrical manipulation. It addresses the challenge of simultaneously controlling semantics and metrics in poetry generation, showcasing practicality and innovation."
