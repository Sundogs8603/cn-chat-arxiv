    "translated_abstract": "具有复杂行为的动力学系统（例如免疫系统细胞与病原体的相互作用）通常通过将行为分为不同的模式或状态，并从中学习模式之间的切换行为来建模。切换动力学系统（SDS）是一种强大的工具，可以自动发现这些模式并从时序数据中学习切换行为。然而，这些方法主要关注独立对象，其中一个对象的模式与其他对象的模式无关。本文则侧重于更一般的相互作用对象设置，涉及切换动力学系统的交互对象，其中每个对象的动态也取决于另一个未知且动态更改的对象及其模式的子集。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的基于图形的切换动力学系统方法，名为“图切换动力学系统”（GRASS），其中我们使用动态图形来描述对象之间的交互和模式切换。我们提供了关于GRASS模型可识别性的理论结果，并开发了高效的推理算法。我们在模拟和实际数据集上展示了我们方法的优越性能。",
