    "translated_abstract": "基于叙事的推荐系统是一个信息获取问题，用户通过详细描述他们的偏好和背景来请求推荐，比如旅行者在描述他们的喜好、不喜欢和旅行情况时请求景点的推荐。随着自然语言对话界面在搜索和推荐系统中的兴起，这些请求变得越来越重要。然而，基于叙事的推荐系统缺乏丰富的训练数据，并且当前的平台通常不支持这些请求。幸运的是，传统的用户-物品交互数据集包含了丰富的文本数据，例如评论，这些评论经常描述了用户的偏好和背景 - 这些数据可以用来为基于叙事的推荐模型进行训练。在这项工作中，我们探索使用大型语言模型 (LLMs) 来进行数据增强，以训练基于叙事的推荐模型。",
