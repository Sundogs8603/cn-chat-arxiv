    "abstract": "Information extraction(IE) is a crucial subfield within natural language processing. In this study, we introduce a Sentence Classification and Named Entity Recognition Multi-task (SCNM) approach that combines Sentence Classification (SC) and Named Entity Recognition (NER). We develop a Sentence-to-Label Generation (SLG) framework for SCNM and construct a Wikipedia dataset containing both SC and NER. Using a format converter, we unify input formats and employ a generative model to generate SC-labels, NER-labels, and associated text segments. We propose a Constraint Mechanism (CM) to improve generated format accuracy. Our results show SC accuracy increased by 1.13 points and NER by 1.06 points in SCNM compared to standalone tasks, with CM raising format accuracy from 63.61 to 100. The findings indicate mutual reinforcement effects between SC and NER, and integration enhances both tasks' performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "信息提取是自然语言处理中一个关键的子领域。本研究介绍了一种句子分类和命名实体识别多任务（SCNM）方法，将句子分类（SC）和命名实体识别（NER）结合在一起。我们开发了一个句子到标签生成（SLG）框架用于SCNM，并构建了一个包含SC和NER数据的维基百科数据集。通过格式转换器，我们统一了输入格式，并使用生成模型生成SC标签、NER标签和相关文本片段。我们提出了一个约束机制（CM）来提高生成的格式准确性。我们的结果显示，与独立任务相比，SCNM中的SC准确度提高了1.13个百分点，NER提高了1.06个百分点，CM将格式准确性从63.61提高到100。研究结果表明SC和NER之间存在相互强化的效应，整合可以提高两个任务的性能。",
