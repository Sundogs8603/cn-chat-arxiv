    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在选择性标记数据下的学习问题。这种问题在历史决策导致结果仅部分标记时出现。标记数据分布可能与整体人群有显著差异，特别是当历史决策和目标结果可以同时受某些未观察到的因素影响时。因此，仅基于标记数据进行学习可能会导致在整体人群中的严重偏差。我们的论文通过利用许多应用中历史决策由一组异质决策者做出的事实来解决此挑战。具体而言，我们在一个有原理的工具变量框架下分析了这种设置。我们建立了满足观察到的数据时任何给定预测规则的全体风险的点识别条件，并在点识别失败时提供了尖锐的风险界限。我们进一步提出了一种加权学习方法，用于学习预测规则。",
