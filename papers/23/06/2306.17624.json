    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习中，为空间中的点生成适合学习的表示是一个基本且长期存在的问题。最近，提出了多尺度编码方案（如Space2Vec和NeRF），可以直接将二维/三维欧几里得空间中的任意点编码为高维向量，并成功应用于各种地理空间预测和生成任务。然而，目前所有的二维和三维位置编码器都是设计用来模拟欧几里得空间中的点距离。因此，在应用于需要在球面上进行距离度量学习的大规模真实世界GPS坐标数据集时，这两种类型的模型都会出现问题，原因是地图投影失真问题（2D）和球面到欧几里得距离近似误差（3D）。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种称为Sphere2Vec的多尺度位置编码器，可以在球面上编码点坐标时保持球面距离。我们在球面上的位置编码的距离保持编码的统一视角上进行了探索。",
