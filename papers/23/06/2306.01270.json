    "translated_abstract": "动态环境下的多机器人路径规划是一个极具挑战性的经典问题。在移动过程中，机器人需要避免与其他移动机器人发生碰撞，同时最小化它们的行驶距离。以往的方法要么使用启发式搜索方法不断重新规划路径以避免冲突，要么基于学习方法选择适当的避碰策略。前者可能由于频繁的重新规划导致行驶距离较长，而后者可能由于低样本探索和利用率而导致学习效率低，从而使模型的训练成本较高。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种路径规划方法MAPPOHR，该方法结合了启发式搜索、经验规则和多智能体强化学习。该方法包含两个层次：基于多智能体强化学习算法MAPPO的实时规划器，其将经验规则嵌入到动作输出层和奖励函数中；以及一个启发式规划器，它生成初始路径并向MAPPO规划器添加约束。我们的实验结果表明，所提出的方法在规划效率和避碰能力方面优于现有方法。",
