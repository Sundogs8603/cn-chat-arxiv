This service provides functions for inflection of single words, word matching and synthesis of grammatically correct Russian text. Selected code and datasets are available at https://github.com/passare-ru/PassareFunctions/ Performance of the inflectional functions has been tested against the annotated corpus of Russian language OpenCorpora, compared with that of other solutions, and used for estimating the morphological variability and complexity of different parts of speech in Russian.",
