    "translated_abstract": "多功能性是指神经网络能够在不改变其网络连接的情况下执行多个互相排斥的任务的能力；是围绕着储层计算机学习范式的一个新兴研究领域。多功能性已在人类和其他动物的大脑中观察到：特别是在果蝇的侧角。在这项工作中，我们将果蝇侧角的连接组学移植到储层计算机（RC）中，并使用“看见两倍”的问题作为基准测试来调查这个“果蝇RC”（FFRC）展示多功能性的程度。我们进一步探索了FFRC在变化网络的谱半径时如何实现多功能性的动态。与广泛使用的Erdos-Renyi储层计算机（ERRC）相比，我们报道了FFRC展示了更大的多功能性能力；在更广的超参数范围内实现了多功能性，并远远超越了解决“看见两倍”的ERRC。",
