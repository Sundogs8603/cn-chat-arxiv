    "translated_abstract": "深度学习技术在图像缺陷检测方面非常有效。然而，训练深度学习分类模型需要大量的标记数据，这通常很昂贵。在许多情况下，可用的训练数据不仅有限，而且可能是不平衡的。本文提出了一种新颖的域自适应（DA）方法，通过从用于类似学习任务的现有源数据集中转移所获得的知识，来解决目标学习任务的标记训练数据稀缺问题。我们的方法适用于源数据集和可用于目标学习任务的数据集具有相同或不同的特征空间的情况。我们将我们的DA方法与基于自编码器的数据增强方法相结合，以解决目标数据集不平衡的问题。我们使用晶圆缺陷预测的图像数据来评估我们的组合方法。实验结果表明，我们的组合方法在标记数据有限或不平衡时具有比其他算法更优秀的性能。",
