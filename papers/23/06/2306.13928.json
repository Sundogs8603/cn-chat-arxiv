    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with a finite-horizon inverse control problem, which has the goal of inferring, from observations, the possibly non-convex and non-stationary cost driving the actions of an agent. In this context, we present a result that enables cost estimation by solving an optimization problem that is convex even when the agent cost is not and when the underlying dynamics is nonlinear, non-stationary and stochastic. To obtain this result, we also study a finite-horizon forward control problem that has randomized policies as decision variables. For this problem, we give an explicit expression for the optimal solution. Moreover, we turn our findings into algorithmic procedures and we show the effectiveness of our approach via both in-silico and experimental validations with real hardware. All the experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文主要论述了一个有限时域的逆控制问题，其目的是从观测值中推断出驱动智能体行动的成本，即使这个成本是非凸和非平稳的，同时受到非线性、非平稳和随机因素的影响。在这种情况下，我们提出了一个解决方案，通过解决一个优化问题来实现成本估计，即使代理成本不是凸的，本文也能够生成凸问题。为了得出这个结果，我们还研究了一个以随机策略为决策变量的有限时域前向控制问题，并给出了最优解的显式表达式。此外，我们将我们的发现转化为算法流程，并通过虚拟实验和真实硬件实验验证了我们的方法的有效性。所有的实验结果都证实了我们方法的有效性。",
