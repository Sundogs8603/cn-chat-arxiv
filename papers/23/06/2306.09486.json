    "translated_abstract": "近几年来，联邦学习（FL）已成为一种应对数据隐私挑战的新兴机器学习技术。在FL算法中，客户端提交本地训练模型，服务器将这些参数进行聚合直至收敛。尽管在计算机视觉、音频和自然语言处理等领域，对FL进行了重大努力，但是利用多模态数据流的FL应用仍然没有得到广泛探索。众所周知，多模态学习在情感识别、医疗保健、多媒体和社交媒体等领域具有广泛的现实应用，而用户隐私仍然是一个重要问题。具体来说，目前还没有针对多模态应用或相关任务的现有FL基准测试。为了促进多模态FL研究，我们介绍了FedMultimodal，这是第一个覆盖十个社区中的五个代表性多模态应用的FL基准测试。",
