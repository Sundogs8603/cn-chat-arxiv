    "abstract": "We consider solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with Fourier neural operators (FNOs), which operate in the frequency domain. Since the laws of physics do not depend on the coordinate system used to describe them, it is desirable to encode such symmetries in the neural operator architecture for better performance and easier learning. While encoding symmetries in the physical domain using group theory has been studied extensively, how to capture symmetries in the frequency domain is under-explored. In this work, we extend group convolutions to the frequency domain and design Fourier layers that are equivariant to rotations, translations, and reflections by leveraging the equivariance property of the Fourier transform. The resulting $G$-FNO architecture generalizes well across input resolutions and performs well in settings with varying levels of symmetry.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究考虑使用在频率域下操作的傅里叶神经算子（FNOs）求解偏微分方程（PDEs）。由于物理定律不依赖于用于描述它们的坐标系, 因此将这些对称性编码进神经算子架构以提高性能和更容易的学习是有益的。尽管使用群论编码物理域内的对称性已经被广泛研究，但如何在频率域内捕捉对称性仍未得到充分探讨。本文将群卷积扩展到频率域，并设计具有旋转、平移和镜像等变性质的傅里叶层，利用傅里叶变换的等变性质。产生的G-FNO架构跨输入分辨率具有良好的推广效果，并在具有不同对称性水平的设置中表现良好。我们的代码可作为AIRS库的一部分公开在Github（https://github.com/divelab/AIRS）上获得。",
