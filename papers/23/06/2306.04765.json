    "abstract": "Publicly deploying research chatbots is a nuanced topic involving necessary risk-benefit analyses. While there have recently been frequent discussions on whether it is responsible to deploy such models, there has been far less focus on the interaction paradigms and design approaches that the resulting interfaces should adopt, in order to achieve their goals more effectively. We aim to pose, ground, and attempt to answer HCI questions involved in this scope, by reporting on a mixed-methods user study conducted on a recent research chatbot. We find that abstract anthropomorphic representation for the agent has a significant effect on user's perception, that offering AI explainability may have an impact on feedback rates, and that two (diegetic and extradiegetic) levels of the chat experience should be intentionally designed. We offer design recommendations and areas of further focus for the research community.",

    "translated_abstract": "公开部署研究聊天机器人是一个涉及必要的风险与收益分析的微妙话题。虽然最近频繁讨论是否负责任地部署此类模型，但对于实现更有效目标的交互范式和设计方法却关注较少。我们通过报告对最近研究聊天机器人进行的混合方法用户研究，力图提出、基于并尝试回答涉及此范围的人机交互问题。我们发现，代理人的抽象拟人化表现对用户的感知有显著影响，提供AI可解释性可能会对反馈率产生影响，而聊天体验的两种水平（故事内和故事外）应有意设计。我们提供设计建议和研究社区进一步关注的领域。",
