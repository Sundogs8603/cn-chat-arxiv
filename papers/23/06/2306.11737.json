    "translated_abstract": "将多边形网格分割为有意义的部分可能具有挑战性。许多应用程序需要将这些结构分解以进行计算机图形学中的进一步处理。在过去的十年中，提出了几种方法来解决这个问题，但代价是计算时间的大量消耗。最近，机器学习已被证明对于对3D结构的分割任务是有效的。然而，这些最先进的方法往往难以推广，并需要将学习的模型分成几个特定的对象类别，以避免过度拟合。我们提出了一种数据驱动的方法，利用深度学习在网格分割之前编码映射函数，以用于多种应用。我们的网络使用顶点邻域之间的相似性复现邻域图，利用我们对形状直径函数（SDF）方法的了解。我们的方法不受分辨率影响，因为我们对输入网格进行下采样，并仅针对邻居查询完整分辨率结构。",
