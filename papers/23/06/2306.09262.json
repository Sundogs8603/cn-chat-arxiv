    "translated_abstract": "尽管基于神经网络的传递噪声的概率模型取得了成功，但最近的研究发现，除非基础分布的尾部得到适当校准，否则这种方法往往不能准确捕捉尾部行为。为了克服这个缺陷，我们提出了一种系统性的方法来分析随机变量的尾部，并阐述了如何在概率编程语言编译器的静态分析（在绘制样本之前）的过程中使用这种方法。为了表征尾部在各种运算下的变化，我们发展了一个代数，它作用于一个三参数尾部渐近的家族上，它基于广义伽玛分布。我们的代数运算在加法和乘法下是封闭的；它们能够区分不同尺度的亚高斯函数；并且它们处理比率足够好，以直接从它们的定义中重现大多数重要的统计分布的尾部。",
