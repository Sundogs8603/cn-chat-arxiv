    "translated_abstract": "能量耗散进化深度算子神经网络是一种运算学习神经网络，旨在为一类偏微分方程种子提供数值解，而不是单个偏微分方程，例如带有不同参数或不同初始条件的偏微分方程。该网络由两个子网络组成：支路网络和干线网络。对于目标运算符 G，支路网络在相同数量的传感器上编码不同的输入函数 u，而干线网络评估任何位置的输出函数。通过最小化评估的输出 q 和预期输出 G(u)(y) 之间的误差，DeepONet 生成 G 运算符的良好近似。为了保留偏微分方程的重要物理特性，如能量耗散定律，我们采用标量辅助变量法生成最小化问题。它引入了修改后的能量并实现了无条件的能量耗散定律。",
