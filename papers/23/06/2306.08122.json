    "translated_abstract": "学术写作中对大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越依赖导致了抄袭现象的增加。现有的AI生成文本分类器准确性有限，往往产生误报。我们提出一种新方法，利用自然语言处理（NLP）技术，提供句子和文档级别的可量化指标，方便人类评估者进行解释。我们的方法采用多方面的方法，生成给定问题的多个释义版本，将它们输入LLM以生成答案。通过使用基于余弦相似度的对比损失函数，将生成的句子与学生回答中的句子匹配。我们的方法在分类人类和AI文本方面的准确性达到了94％，为学术环境中的抄袭检测提供了强大而适应性强的解决方案。该方法随着LLM技术的发展而不断改进，减少了新模型训练或重新配置的需求，并提供了比传统黑匣子方法更透明的评估方式。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种新的自然语言处理方法，可对学术写作中的抄袭行为进行有效检测，不仅在句子级别上进行评估，还在文档级别上提供可量化指标。该方法的准确率高达94％，具有较强的适应性和可靠性，能够不断随着LLM技术的发展而不断改进。",
