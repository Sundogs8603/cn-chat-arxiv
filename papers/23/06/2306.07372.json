    "abstract": "Modern reinforcement learning systems produce many high-quality policies throughout the learning process. However, to choose which policy to actually deploy in the real world, they must be tested under an intractable number of environmental conditions. We introduce RPOSST, an algorithm to select a small set of test cases from a larger pool based on a relatively small number of sample evaluations. RPOSST treats the test case selection problem as a two-player game and optimizes a solution with provable $k$-of-$N$ robustness, bounding the error relative to a test that used all the test cases in the pool. Empirical results demonstrate that RPOSST finds a small set of test cases that identify high quality policies in a toy one-shot game, poker datasets, and a high-fidelity racing simulator.",

    "translated_abstract": "现代强化学习系统在学习过程中会产生许多高质量的策略。然而，在实际应用中选择哪种策略时，它们必须在不可解的大量环境条件下进行测试。我们介绍了一种算法RPOSST，它能够从较大的测试案例池中选择一小部分测试样例，这是根据相对较小的样本评估来实现的。RPOSST将测试样例选择问题视为一个双人博弈，并优化具有可证明的k-of-N健壮性的解决方案，以限制相对于使用池中所有测试用例的测试的误差。实证结果表明，RPOSST能够在一个玩具单一游戏、扑克数据集和高保真赛车模拟器中发现可以识别高质量策略的一小组测试用例。",
