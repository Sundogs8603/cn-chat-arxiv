    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于绿色学习范式的图像隐写分析新方法，称为Green Steganalyzer（GS）。GS由三个模块组成：1）基于像素的异常预测，2）嵌入位置检测，3）图像级别检测的决策融合。通过对图像进行补丁分解、采用Saab变换进行特征提取和进行自监督学习来预测其中心像素的异常得分，GS在第一个模块中进行处理。在第二个模块中，GS分析像素和邻域的异常得分，以找到更高嵌入概率的像素。在第三个模块中，GS聚焦于更高嵌入概率的像素，并将它们的异常得分融合起来进行最终的图像级别分类。与现有的深度学习模型相比，GS在相同检测性能下，计算复杂度更低，模型大小更小，并能对S-UNIWARD、WOW和HILL隐写方案获得可比的检测性能。",
