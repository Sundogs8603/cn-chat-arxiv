    "translated_abstract": "基于项目语义相似性，项目对项目（I2I）推荐在大部分推荐系统中都是一个重要的功能，可以为特定的项目生成替换或补充建议。基于推荐系统中的某些项目子集可能由同一组客户共同交互，图形模型（如图形神经网络）提供了一种自然的框架来结合、摄取和提取来自这些目录化项目的高阶关系交互以及它们的元数据特性所提供的有价值的见解，许多最近的研究已经证明了这一点。然而，有效地为I2I学习GNN需要摄取大量的关系数据，这可能并不总是可用的，尤其是在新兴市场领域。为了缓解这种数据瓶颈，我们假设可以从现有成熟市场领域（具有私有数据）中学习到的推荐模式可以被适应，从而建立起有效的热启动模型。",
