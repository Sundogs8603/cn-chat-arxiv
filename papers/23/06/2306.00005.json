    "translated_abstract": "医疗保健机构中的临床记录将使用国际疾病分类（ICD）编码标记; 这是一组用于医疗诊断和手术的分类编码。由于嘈杂的临床文档输入和长尾式标签分布，ICD编码是一个具有挑战性的多标签文本分类问题。最近的自动ICD编码方法通过额外的数据和知识库对医疗笔记和代码进行编码以提高性能。然而，他们大多数不反映出人类编码者如何生成代码：首先，编码员选择通用代码类别，然后查找与患者情况相关的具体子类别。受此启发，我们提出了一种两阶段解码机制来预测ICD代码。我们的模型利用代码的层次属性将预测分解为两个步骤：首先，我们预测父代码，然后根据之前的预测预测子代码。公共MIMIC-III数据集上的实验表明，我们的方法在准确性方面具有竞争力。",
