    "translated_abstract": "神经网络在已知的算法任务上训练，能否可靠地重新发现解决这些任务的已知算法？最近的一些研究，涉及到从群算术到上下文线性回归的任务，表明答案是肯定的。我们以模块加法为典型问题，展示了神经网络中的算法发现有时更加复杂。对模型超参数和初始化进行微小的更改，可以导致从固定训练集中发现定性不同的算法，甚至是并行实现多个这样的算法。一些训练用于执行模块加法的网络实现了熟悉的时钟算法；其他实现了以前未描述过的、不太直观但可理解的过程，我们将其称为披萨算法，或者其他更复杂的过程。我们的结果表明，即使简单的学习问题也可以有令人惊讶的多样解决方案，促进了新工具的发展。",
