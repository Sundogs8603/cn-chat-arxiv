We resolve several open questions posed by other authors, both by examples from our data and theorems. We give a new set of results on the symmetry properties of Condorcet domains which unify earlier works.

    "translated_abstract": "本文首次明确列举了所有在$n\\leq 7$个选项上的最大Condorcet领域。通过开发一种新的构造Condorcet领域的算法，并在超级计算机上实现该算法的运行，我们完成了这一目标。随后，我们对所有最大Condorcet领域在度数为7的情况下的属性进行了首次调查，涉及社会科学和数学文献中研究的许多属性。我们通过数据示例和定理解决了其他作者提出的几个未解疑问。我们给出了一组关于Condorcet领域对称性的新结果，统一了之前的作品。最后，我们讨论了与非独裁领域和泛化的单峰领域等其他领域类型的联系。我们通过一个新的网站免费提供所有数据供其他研究者使用。",
