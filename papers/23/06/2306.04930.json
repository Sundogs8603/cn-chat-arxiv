    "translated_abstract": "基于AI的代码推荐系统，如Copilot和CodeWhisperer，提供程序员环境（例如IDE）内的代码建议，旨在提高他们的生产力。由于在这些场景中，程序员接受和拒绝建议，因此理想情况下，该系统应使用此反馈以促进这一目标。本研究利用程序员与Copilot交互的先前数据，开发可以节省程序员时间的干预措施。我们提出了一个实用理论框架，用于建模与程序员的交互，并决定何时展示哪些建议。我们的框架“基于人类反馈的条件建议展示”（CDHF）基于对程序员操作的预测模型。使用535名程序员的数据，我们构建了可以预测建议接受程度的模型。在对通过AI辅助编程解决的真实世界编程任务的回顾性评估中，我们发现CDHF能够实现有利的权衡。我们的发现表明，整合人类反馈可以显著提高基于AI的代码推荐系统的有效性。",
