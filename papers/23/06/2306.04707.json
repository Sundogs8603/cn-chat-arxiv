    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了BlenderBot 3x，它是会话模型BlenderBot 3的一个更新版本，现在通过参与者的有机对话和反馈数据进行训练，以改进其技能和安全性。我们公开发布了参与者匿名交互数据，供研究社区使用，以促进进一步的进展。使用有机数据训练模型是具有挑战性的，因为与人们在“野外”的互动包括高质量的对话和反馈，以及对抗性和有毒的行为。我们研究了一些技术，使模型能够从有益的教师学习，同时避免从试图将模型诱导为无用或有毒反应的人中学习。BlenderBot 3x在对话中比BlenderBot 3更受欢迎，并在挑战性情况下显示出更安全的响应。虽然我们目前的模型仍远非完美，但我们相信通过继续使用我们提出的技术以及探索从有机交互中学习的新方法，可以进一步改进。",
