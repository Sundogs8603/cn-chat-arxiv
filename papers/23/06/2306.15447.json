    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型现在被调整为与其创建者的目标保持一致，即\"有益且无害\"。这些模型应该对用户的问题给出有益的回答，但拒绝回答可能会造成伤害的请求。然而，对抗用户可以构建绕过对齐尝试的输入。在这项工作中，我们研究了在与构造最坏情况输入（对抗性样本）的对抗用户交互时，这些模型保持多大程度的对齐。这些输入被设计成导致模型发出本应禁止的有害内容。我们展示了现有基于自然语言处理的优化攻击手法在可靠攻击对齐文本模型方面的不足之处：即使在当前基于自然语言处理的攻击失败时，我们仍然可以通过蛮力方法找到对抗性输入。因此，当前攻击的失败不应被视为对齐文本模型在面对对抗性输入时仍然保持对齐的证明。但是近期大规模机器学习模型的趋势是多模态的。",
