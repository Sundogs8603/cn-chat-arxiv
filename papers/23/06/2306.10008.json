    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的面部识别系统的成功已经引起了严重的隐私问题，因为它们能够在数字世界中启用未授权的用户跟踪。现有的隐私增强方法无法生成自然主义图像，既能保护面部隐私又不会损害用户体验。我们提出了一种新的面部隐私保护方法，采用两步法，依靠在预训练生成模型的低维流形中找到对抗性潜在编码。第一步将给定的面部图像反演成潜在空间中的编码，并微调生成模型，以从其潜在代码准确地重构给定的图像。这一步产生了一个良好的初始化，有助于生成类似于给定身份的高质量面部。随后，使用用户定义的化妆文本提示和保持身份的规范化来指导在潜在空间中寻找对抗性代码的搜索。广泛的实验表明，我们的方法能够生成具有高质量化妆的面部图像，可有效地保护面部隐私。",
