    "abstract": "Transcriptions of phone calls are of significant value across diverse fields, such as sales, customer service, healthcare, and law enforcement. Nevertheless, the analysis of these recorded conversations can be an arduous and time-intensive process, especially when dealing with extended or multifaceted dialogues. In this work, we propose a novel method, GPT-distilled Calls Segmentation and Tagging (GPT-Calls), for efficient and accurate call segmentation and topic extraction. GPT-Calls is composed of offline and online phases. The offline phase is applied once to a given list of topics and involves generating a distribution of synthetic sentences for each topic using a GPT model and extracting anchor vectors. The online phase is applied to every call separately and scores the similarity between the transcripted conversation and the topic anchors found in the offline phase. Then, time domain analysis is applied to the similarity scores to group utterances into segments and tag them with ",

    "translated_abstract": "电话录音的转录在销售、客户服务、医疗保健和执法等各个领域具有重要价值。然而，分析这些录音对话可以是一项艰巨而耗时的任务，特别是当处理长时间或多方面的对话时。本文提出了一种新颖的方法，GPT-distilled Calls Segmentation and Tagging (GPT-Calls)，以实现高效和准确的通话分段和主题提取。GPT-Calls由离线和在线两个阶段组成，其中离线阶段针对给定的主题列表仅应用一次，使用GPT模型生成每个主题的合成句子分布并提取锚向量。在线阶段针对每个通话单独应用，并对转录的对话与离线阶段找到的主题锚定进行相似性评分。然后，时间域分析被应用于相似性得分中，将话语分组并将其标记为...",
