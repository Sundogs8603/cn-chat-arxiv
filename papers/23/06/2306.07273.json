    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新的隐私概念，称为$f$-成员推断隐私($f$-MIP)，它明确考虑了在成员推断攻击威胁模型下现实对手的能力。通过这样做，$f$-MIP提供了可解释的隐私保证和改进的效用(例如更好的分类准确率)。我们对噪声随机梯度下降(SGD)的似然比成员推断攻击进行了新颖的理论分析，得到了一个参数化的$f$-MIP保证族，称为$\\mu$-高斯成员推断隐私($\\mu$-GMIP)。我们的分析还产生了一种分析性的成员推断攻击，与以前的方法相比具有显著优势。首先，与现有方法不同，我们的攻击不需要训练数百个影子模型来逼近似然比。其次，我们的分析攻击使得$f$-MIP的简单审计成为可能。最后，我们的分析强调了方差的重要性。",

An analytical membership inference attack is also presented, which avoids training numerous shadow models, and the importance of variance is emphasized."
