    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method for solving the robust Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) phase-shifts configuration problem in heterogeneous communication environments within a Federated Learning (FL) framework. By using causal representations to learn invariant representations and predicting the phase shifts, the proposed method achieves Nash Equilibrium of the FL game. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
