    "translated_abstract": "充分利用雾环境的好处，有效地管理数据位置非常重要。盲目或反应式的数据复制无法充分利用雾计算的潜力，需要更先进的技术来预测客户端何时何地连接。虽然空间预测受到了相当多的关注，但时间预测仍未得到充分研究。本文通过研究将时间预测纳入现有空间预测模型的优势来填补这一空白。我们还在预测复制的背景下对时空预测模型（如深度神经网络和马尔可夫模型）进行全面分析。我们提出了一种利用Holder-Winter指数平滑法进行时间预测的新模型，利用顺序和周期性用户移动模式。在模拟真实用户轨迹的雾网络中，我们的模型在多余数据上实现了15％的降低，而数据可用性只有1％的微小降低。",
