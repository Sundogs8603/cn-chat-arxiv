    "translated_abstract": "使用脑电图（EEG）进行情绪检测是脑机接口领域中非常关键的领域，并在康复和医学领域有很有价值的应用。本研究采用了迁移学习来克服基于EEG情绪检测的数据有限性挑战。本研究中使用的基本模型是Resnet50。此外，我们在基于EEG的情绪检测中采用了一种新颖的特征组合。模型的输入形式是一个图像矩阵，其中上三角矩阵和下三角矩阵分别包括平均相位相干（MPC）和幅度平方相干（MSC）。我们通过将差分熵（DE）获得的特征结合到对角线中进一步改进了该技术，以前对情绪分类几乎没有有用的信息。本研究使用的数据集是SEED EEG（62通道EEG），包括三个类别（积极，中性和消极）。我们计算了使用我们的方法进行情绪检测的准确性，并比较了其它方法的准确性。",
