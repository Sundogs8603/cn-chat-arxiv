    "translated_abstract": "在慢性疾病中，正确诊断和提供最适当的治疗通常并不足以保证患者临床状况的改善。低治疗依从性是阻碍达到治疗目标的主要原因之一，尤其是在某些疾病和特定目标患者（如儿童）中尤为常见。一种有趣的技术可以用于支持临床实践，以实现更好的健康结果。我们假设与传统的治疗教育方法相比，与人类形态机器人的游戏化会话可以更加有效地教授儿童哮喘患者正确的吸入方法。在这个角度上，我们描述了在Pepper机器人平台上实现的交互式模块以及计划于2020年在Palermo的CNR肺部过敏兒童诊所开展的一项研究。由于COVID-19紧急情况的原因，这项研究被取消，但我们提供初步结果，以评估方法的可行性和同龄人的兴趣。通过分析培训前后的吸入习惯的比较和给参与者的问卷调查结果来评估教育结果。",
