    "translated_abstract": "深度学习成功地应用于移动边缘计算（MEC）的任务卸载和资源分配优化中。然而，边缘网络的动态性在神经网络（NN）优化方法中导致了两个挑战：低可扩展性和高训练成本。尽管传统的节点输出图神经网络（GNN）在网络规模扩展时能够提取边缘节点的特征，但它们在处理维度决策空间随网络规模扩展而变化的新可扩展性问题时会失败。针对这个问题，本文提出了一种基于链路输出GNN（LOGNN）的资源管理方法，用于对MEC中任意数量的边缘节点进行灵活的资源分配优化，并具有极低的算法推理延迟。此外，采用无需标签的无监督方法来高效地训练LOGNN，其中明确地推导出了边缘任务处理延迟相对于LOGNN参数的梯度。此外，本文还给出了一个理论上的推导，证明LOGNN的收敛性和泛化性。",
