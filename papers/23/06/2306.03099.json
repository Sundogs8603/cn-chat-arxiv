    "translated_abstract": "为了预测和实时控制任务，经常使用基于机器学习（ML）的数字孪生。 然而，尽管这些模型通常准确，但它们是为单个系统定制的，使得系统对系统（S2S）转移困难。 即使在不同化学系统的过程动力学存在重要相似性时也会出现这种情况。 为了应对这一挑战，我们开发了一种新颖的时间序列转换器（TST）框架，利用变压器算法中内在的强大转移学习能力。 这是使用从在各种操作场景下工作的不同晶体器中获得的可用过程数据展示的。 使用这个广泛的数据集，我们训练了一个TST模型（CrystalGPT），它在所有预先建立的系统之间展现了显着的S2S可转移性，甚至对于未遇到的系统也是如此。 CrystalGPT在所有系统中共同实现的累积误差是现有最先进技术的8倍。",
