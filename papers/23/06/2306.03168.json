    "abstract": "Although psycholinguists and psychologists have long studied the tendency of linguistic strings to evoke mental images in hearers or readers, most computational studies have applied this concept of imageability only to isolated words. Using recent developments in text-to-image generation models, such as DALLE mini, we propose computational methods that use generated images to measure the imageability of both single English words and connected text. We sample text prompts for image generation from three corpora: human-generated image captions, news article sentences, and poem lines. We subject these prompts to different deformances to examine the model's ability to detect changes in imageability caused by compositional change. We find high correlation between the proposed computational measures of imageability and human judgments of individual words. We also find the proposed measures more consistently respond to changes in compositionality than baseline approaches. We discuss possible ",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管语言学学者和心理学家长期以来一直研究语言字符串在听者或读者中引发心理图像的倾向，但大多数计算研究仅将这种形象化的概念应用于孤立的单词。本文利用最近发展的文本到图像生成模型（如DALLE mini），提出了使用生成的图像来测量单个英语单词和相关文本的形象化能力的计算方法。我们从三个语料库中提取文本提示，包括人类生成的图像标题、新闻文章句子和诗歌行。我们对这些提示进行不同的变形，以检查模型检测到的由组合变化引起的形象化能力变化的能力。我们发现，所提出的形象化能力的计算措施与人类对单词的判断之间存在较高的相关性。我们还发现，所提出的措施更一致地响应组合变化而不是基线方法。最后，我们讨论了可能的应用和未来工作。",
