    "translated_abstract": "少样本节点分类（FSNC）是图表示学习中的一个挑战，仅有每个类别少量已标记节点可用于训练。为了解决这个问题，元学习被提出来将结构知识从有丰富标签的基类中转移至目标新类别。然而，当基类没有或标记节点非常少时，现有的解决方案变得无效或不可行。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一种创新方法，称为虚拟节点调整（VNT）。我们的方法利用预训练的图变换器作为编码器，并在嵌入空间中注入虚拟节点作为软提示，可通过少量样本标签在新类别中进行优化，以调制每个特定的FSNC任务的节点嵌入。 VNT的一项独特特点是，通过结合基于图的伪提示演化（GPPE）模块，VNT-GPPE可以处理基类别中有稀疏标签的情况。四个数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的方法在少样本分类准确性方面优于多个基线方法。",
