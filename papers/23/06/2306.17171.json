    "abstract": "With the advancement in technology, Cloud computing always amazes the world with revolutionizing solutions that automate and simplify complex computational tasks. The advantages like no maintenance cost, accessibility, data backup, pay-per-use models, unlimited storage, and processing power encourage individuals and businesses to migrate their workload to the cloud. Despite the numerous advantages of cloud computing, the geolocation of data in the cloud environment is a massive concern, which relates to the performance and government legislation that will be applied to data. The unclarity of data geolocation can cause compliance concerns. In this work, we have presented a technique that will allow users to restrict the geolocation of their data in the cloud environment. We have used trusted computing mechanisms to attest the host and its geolocation remotely. With this model, the user will upload the data whose decryption key will be shared with a third-party attestation server only. T",

    "translated_abstract": "随着技术的进步，云计算通过革命性的解决方案自动化和简化复杂的计算任务，不断给世界带来惊喜。免维护成本、可访问性、数据备份、按使用付费模式、无限存储和处理能力等优势，鼓励个人和企业将工作负载迁移到云端。尽管云计算有许多优点，但数据在云环境中的地理位置是一个巨大的问题，它与数据所受到的性能和政府法规有关。数据地理位置的不清晰可能引发合规性问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种技术，允许用户限制其数据在云环境中的地理位置。我们使用可信计算机制远程验证主机及其地理位置。在这个模型中，用户将上传其数据，并将解密密钥仅与第三方验证服务器共享。",
