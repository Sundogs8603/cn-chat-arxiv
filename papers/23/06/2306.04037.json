    "abstract": "We present a comprehensive analysis of quantitatively evaluating explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques for remote sensing image classification. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to perform remote sensing image classification across multiple modalities. We investigate the results of the models qualitatively through XAI methods. Additionally, we compare the XAI methods quantitatively through various categories of desired properties. Through our analysis, we offer insights and recommendations for selecting the most appropriate XAI method(s) to gain a deeper understanding of the models' decision-making processes.
