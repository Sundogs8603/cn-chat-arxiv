    "translated_abstract": "住院时长是一项重要的管理指标，如果提前知道，可以用来有效地规划入院、分配资源和改善护理。通过使用历史患者数据和机器学习技术，可以开发出住院时长预测模型。从伦理角度来看，这些模型不能用于替代部门主管对于患者出院的决策，但对于负责有效医院规划的医院管理系统来说是非常必要的。因此，预测系统的设计应该适应真实的医院环境。在本研究中，我们通过应用领域适应技术，在入院单位的细粒度层面上预测早期住院时长，以利用从潜在源领域学到的信息。从eICU-CRD和MIMIC-IV分别提取了110,079次和60,492次患者入住9个重症监护病房的时变数据。这些数据被输入到长短期记忆网络和全连接网络中，训练出一个源领域模型，wei",
