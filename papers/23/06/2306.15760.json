    "abstract": "In the domain of unsupervised image-to-image transformation using generative transformative models, CycleGAN has become the architecture of choice. One of the primary downsides of this architecture is its relatively slow rate of convergence. In this work, we use discriminator-driven explainability to speed up the convergence rate of the generative model by using saliency maps from the discriminator that mask the gradients of the generator during backpropagation, based on the work of Nagisetty et al., and also introducing the saliency map on input, added onto a Gaussian noise mask, by using an interpretable latent variable based on Wang M.'s Mask CycleGAN. This allows for an explainability fusion in both directions, and utilizing the noise-added saliency map on input as evidence-based counterfactual filtering. This new architecture has much higher rate of convergence than a baseline CycleGAN architecture while preserving the image quality.",

    "translated_abstract": "在使用生成转换模型进行无监督图像转换的领域中，CycleGAN已成为首选架构。这种架构的主要缺点之一是其相对较慢的收敛速度。在本文中，我们使用辨别器驱动的可解释性来加速生成模型的收敛速度，通过使用来自辨别器的显著性地图来遮蔽生成器在反向传播过程中的梯度，基于Nagisetty等人的工作，并引入带有高斯噪声掩蔽的输入上的显著性地图，使用基于Wang M.的Mask CycleGAN的可解释的潜变量。这允许在两个方向上进行可解释性融合，并利用添加噪声的输入上的显著性地图作为基于证据的对照过滤。这种新的架构比基线CycleGAN架构具有更高的收敛速度，同时保持图像质量。",
