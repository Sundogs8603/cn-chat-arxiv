In recent studies, ChatGPT, the current cutting-edge large language model (LLM), has been widely applied to a wide range of software engineering tasks. However, its performance in automated log parsing remains unclear. In this paper, we evaluate ChatGPT's ability to undertake log parsing by addressing two research questions. (1) Can ChatGPT effectively parse logs? (2) How does ChatGPT perform with different prompting methods?

    "translated_abstract": "软件日志在确保大规模软件系统的可靠性和可维护性方面扮演着至关重要的角色，因为它们通常是运行时信息的唯一来源。日志解析将原始日志消息转换为结构化数据，是向下游日志分析的重要初始步骤。在最近的研究中，当前最先进的大型语言模型（LLM）ChatGPT已广泛应用于各种软件工程任务。然而，它在自动化日志解析方面的性能仍不清楚。在本文中，我们通过解决两个研究问题评估了ChatGPT进行日志解析的能力。 （1）ChatGPT能否有效地解析日志？（2）ChatGPT在不同提示方法下的表现如何？我们的结果表明，ChatGPT可以通过适当的提示实现有前途的日志解析结果，特别是在few-shot提示下。基于我们的发现，我们概述了几个基于ChatGPT的日志解析的挑战和机遇。",
