The key feature of the proposed classifier is filtering out the built-up region using spectral indices followed by random forest classification on the remaining mask with carefully selected features.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种适合城市地区绿地覆盖率估计的多光谱随机森林分类器，它具有适当的特征选择和掩蔽。所提出分类器的关键特点是利用光谱指数过滤掉建筑区域，然后使用精选特征对剩余掩蔽上实现随机森林分类。使用Sentinel-2卫星影像数据对Lahore University of Management Sciences（LUMS）的指定区域（约82英亩）进行评估，并表明我们的方法优于传统的随机森林分类器，以及European Space Agency（ESA）WorldCover 10m 2020产品和DeepLabv3深度学习架构等最先进的方法。",
