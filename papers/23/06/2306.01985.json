    "translated_abstract": "警告：本文包含可能令人不适或冒犯的内容。理解陈述的危害和冒犯性需要对陈述的社交和情境背景进行推理。例如，\"你的英语非常好\"这句话在白人对非白色同事说出时可能暗示着侮辱，但在ESL老师对学生说出时则被解释为真诚的赞美。先前的有关有害语言侦测的方法很大程度上忽略了这些情境因素。我们引入了COBRA框架，第一个基于社交和情境背景解释攻击性或有偏见陈述意图，反应和危害的上下文感知形式主义。我们创建了COBRACORPUS，一个包含3.3万个潜在有害陈述和机器生成的上下文及其有害性、隐含偏见、说话意图和听众反应的自由文本解释数据集。为了研究有害语言的情境动态，我们使用COBRA框架分析并比较不同情境下攻击性陈述的危害和解释，包括个人交谈、社交媒体和新闻文章等。我们的研究结果表明，攻击性陈述可以传达不同的偏见、意图和危害，取决于社交和情境背景，凸显了在有害语言侦测和管理中需要上下文感知的模型。",
