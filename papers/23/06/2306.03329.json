To accelerate therapeutic antibody discovery, computational methods, especially machine learning, have attracted considerable interest for predicting specific interactions between antibody candidates and target antigens such as viruses and bacteria.

To overcome these limitations, we have developed AVIDa-hIL6, a large-scale dataset for predicting antigen-antibody interactions in the variable domain of heavy chain of heavy chain antibodies (VHHs), produced from an alpaca immunized with the human interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein, as antigens.

    "translated_abstract": "抗体已经成为治疗人类疾病的重要药物。为了加速治疗抗体的发现，计算方法，特别是机器学习，已经引起了相当大的关注，用于预测在抗体候选和目标抗原（如病毒和细菌）之间的特定相互作用。然而，现有研究中公开可用的数据集具有明显的限制，如规模小，缺乏非结合样本和准确的氨基酸序列。为了克服这些限制，我们开发了AVIDa-hIL6, 一个大规模的VHH数据集，用于预测具有人类白细胞介素-6（IL-6）蛋白，作为抗原的VHHs的抗原 - 抗体相互作用。通过利用VHHs的简单结构，有利于通过DNA测序技术识别全长氨基酸序列，AVIDa-hIL6包含573,891个抗原 - VHH对，其中62,067对是结合样本。",
