    "abstract": "Most medical dialogue systems assume that patients have clear goals (medicine querying, surgical operation querying, etc.) before medical consultation. However, in many real scenarios, due to the lack of medical knowledge, it is usually difficult for patients to determine clear goals with all necessary slots. In this paper, we identify this challenge as how to construct medical consultation dialogue systems to help patients clarify their goals. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a novel task and create a human-to-human mixed-type medical consultation dialogue corpus, termed MidMed, covering five dialogue types: task-oriented dialogue for diagnosis, recommendation, knowledge-grounded dialogue, QA, and chitchat. MidMed covers four departments (otorhinolaryngology, ophthalmology, skin, and digestive system), with 8,175 dialogues. Furthermore, we build baselines on MidMed and propose an instruction-guiding medical dialogue generation framework, termed InsMed, to address this task. Expe",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数医疗对话系统假设在医学咨询之前，患者都有明确的目标（药物查询、手术查询等）。然而，在许多实际情况下，由于缺乏医学知识，患者通常很难确定所需信息并制定明确的目标。本文将这一挑战视为如何构建医学咨询对话系统以帮助患者澄清目标。为了缓解这一挑战，我们提出了一个新的任务，并创建了一个人对人的混合类型医学咨询对话语料库（MidMed），包括诊断、建议、知识引导、问答和闲聊等五种对话类型。MidMed涵盖了四个部门（耳鼻喉科、眼科、皮肤科和消化系统），共有8175段对话。此外，我们在MidMed上建立了基线，并提出了一种指导式的医学对话生成框架（InsMed）来解决这个问题。实验结果表明，我们提出的框架在多个评估指标上实现了最先进的性能。",
