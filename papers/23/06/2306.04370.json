    "translated_abstract": "外卖推荐系统旨在精准提供符合用户兴趣的商店和食物，已经为数十亿用户的日常生活提供服务。与传统推荐不同，外卖推荐面临两个主要挑战：（1）双重交互感知偏好建模。传统的推荐通常关注用户对物品的单一偏好，而外卖推荐需要全面考虑用户对商店和食品的双重偏好。(2) 周期性变化偏好建模。传统的推荐通常从会话级别或日级别的角度来建模用户偏好的连续变化。然而，在实际的外卖系统中，用户的偏好在早晨、中午、晚上和深夜等时段都会有显著的变化。针对这些挑战，我们提出了一种基于双周期变化偏好的外卖推荐建模（DPVP）方法。具体来说，我们设计了一个双重交互感知模块，旨在",
