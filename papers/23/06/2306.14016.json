Accurately forecasting the vital signs of patients with sepsis provides valuable insights to clinicians for timely interventions, such as administering stabilizing drugs or optimizing infusion strategies. Our research examines N-BEATS, an interpretable deep-learning forecasting model that can forecast 3 hours of vital signs for sepsis patients in intensive care units (ICUs). In this work, we use the N-BEATS interpretable configuration to forecast the vital sign trends and compare them with the actual trend to understand better the patient's changing condition and the effects of infused drugs on their vital signs. We evaluate our approach using the publicly available eICU Collaborative Research Database dataset and rigorously evaluate the vital sign forecasts using out-of-sample evaluation criteria. We present the performance of our model using error metrics, including mean squared error (",

    "translated_abstract": "检测和预测感染性休克对患者的最佳处理结果极为重要。准确地预测感染患者的生命体征可为临床医生提供有价值的见解，以进行及时的干预，如给予稳定药物或优化输液策略。本研究使用N-BEATS可解释的深度学习预测模型，能够预测重症监护病房（ICU）中感染患者的3小时生命体征。我们采用N-BEATS可解释的配置预测生命体征趋势，并与实际趋势进行比较，以更好地了解患者的病情变化和药物对其生命体征的影响。我们使用公开可用的eICU Collaborative Research Database数据集评估我们的方法，并采用样外评估标准对生命体征预测进行了严格评估。我们使用误差度量来展示模型的性能，包括均方误差（MSE）、平均绝对误差（MAE）和平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）。我们的结果表明，N-BEATS在预测感染患者的生命体征方面优于几种基准模型。",
