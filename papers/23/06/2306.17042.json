    "abstract": "Legal language can be understood as the language typically used by those engaged in the legal profession and, as such, it may come both in spoken or written form. Recent legislation on cybersecurity obviously uses legal language in writing, thus inheriting all its interpretative complications due to the typical abundance of cases and sub-cases as well as to the general richness in detail. This paper faces the challenge of the essential interpretation of the legal language of cybersecurity, namely of the extraction of the essential Parts of Speech (POS) from the legal documents concerning cybersecurity. The challenge is overcome by our methodology for POS tagging of legal language.

    "translated_abstract": "法律语言可以理解为律师职业中通常使用的语言，可以是口语或书面形式。最近关于网络安全的立法显然使用了书面的法律语言，因此继承了其解释复杂性，包括案例和细节的丰富性。本文面对的挑战是对网络安全法律语言进行基本解释，即从与网络安全有关的法律文件中提取基本词性（POS）。我们的方法论克服了这个挑战，它利用了最先进的开源自然语言处理（NLP）工具以及手动分析来验证工具的结果。结果，这个方法是自动化的，可以适用于任何法律语言，只需对预处理步骤进行轻微调整。",
