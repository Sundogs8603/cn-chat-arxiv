    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于概念的方法成为了一些最有前途的可解释方法，帮助我们解释人工神经网络（ANN）的决策。这些方法试图在两个关键步骤中发现被隐藏在ANN激活的复杂模式中的可理解的视觉“概念”：（1）概念提取，（2）重要性评估。虽然这两个步骤是各种方法之间共同的，但它们的具体实现都有所不同。在这里，我们介绍了一个统一的理论框架，全面定义和澄清了这两个步骤。该框架具有几个优点，它允许我们：（i）提出新的评估指标来比较不同的概念提取方法；（ii）利用现代归因方法和评估指标来扩展和系统地评估最先进的基于概念的方法和重要性评估技术；（iii）推导关于这种方法的最优性的理论保证。",
