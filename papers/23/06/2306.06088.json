    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了SENS，一种从手绘草图中生成和编辑3D模型的新方法，包括那些抽象的草图。我们的方法允许用户快速轻松地草绘形状，然后将草图映射到一个面向部件的神经隐式形状架构的潜空间中。SENS分析草图并将其部件编码成ViT补丁编码，然后将其馈送到transformer解码器中，将其转换为适用于编辑3D隐式神经形状的形状嵌入。SENS不仅提供了直观的基于草图的生成和编辑，而且在捕捉用户草图意图方面表现出色，可以生成各种新颖和富有表现力的3D形状，甚至可以从抽象的草图中生成。我们使用客观指标评估标准和决定性用户研究来展示该模型的有效性，两者均表明它在具有中等抽象程度的草图中表现出强大的性能。此外，我们展示了它直观的基于草图的形状编辑功能。",
