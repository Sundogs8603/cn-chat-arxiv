    "translated_abstract": "模板匹配是计算机视觉中的基础问题，并在物体检测、图像配准和物体跟踪等领域有应用。当前最先进的方法是依赖于最近邻（NN）匹配，在该方法中，将查询特征空间转换为NN空间，其中每个查询像素用模板像素中的最近邻表示。NN匹配在遮挡、外观变化、光照变化和非刚性变换等方面表现出更好的性能。然而，NN匹配在高分辨率数据和高维特征方面的扩展性较差。本文提出了一种基于NN的模板匹配方法，该方法有效地减少了NN计算量，并在NN场中引入滤波以考虑变形。首先，通过向量量化将模板表示为k个特征，然后通过滤波比较模板和查询在k个特征上的分布。我们展示了该方法达到了最先进的性能。",
