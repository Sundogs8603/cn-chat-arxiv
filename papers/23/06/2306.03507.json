    "translated_abstract": "质量评估（QE）的任务是在没有参考翻译的情况下评估翻译的质量。QE的目标与语料库过滤的任务相一致，即为在伪并行语料库中的句对分配质量分数。我们提出了一种基于质量评估的过滤方法，以从伪并行语料库中提取高质量平行数据。据我们所知，这是一个将QE框架用于从伪并行语料库中提取高质量平行语料库的新颖适应方法。通过使用这个过滤后的语料库进行训练，相对于基准模型，我们观察到英马拉雅语、中文-英语和印地语-孟加拉语语种的机器翻译系统的性能提高了多达1.8个BLEU分数。基准模型是在整个伪并行语料库上进行训练的。我们的少样本QE模型从英马拉雅语QE模型中传递学习并在仅500个印地语-孟加拉语训练实例上进行微调，相对于传统的方法，显示出了对过滤后的语料库质量的改进。",
