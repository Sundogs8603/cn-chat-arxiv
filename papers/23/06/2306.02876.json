Online and offline entities are governed by different rules. Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, online entities -but not physical-world entities -- are immune from lawsuits related to content authored by their users or customers. As a result, online entities have been able to avoid claims for harms caused by their negligence and defective product designs simply because they operate online.

    "translated_abstract": "我们在网上进行各种活动，购物、旅游、投资、社交，甚至举办二手拍卖会。虽然我们可能不关心一个公司是在线上还是在现实世界中运营，但对公司本身而言，这个问题却具有重大的影响。在线上和现实世界中的企业受到不同的规则支配。根据《通信廉正法》第230条，在线实体——但非现实世界的实体——对于其用户或客户所撰写的内容相关的诉讼免责。因此，在线上实体因其运营方式而能够避免因疏忽和产品设计缺陷而导致的损害索赔。这种差别对待的原因在于互联网在过去20年里的巨大变化。1996年的互联网作为信息库和通信渠道，被《通信廉正法》很好地管理和治理，将互联网实体视为另一种大众媒体：因为Facebook、Twitter和其他在线实体对其用户或客户所撰写的内容不进行审核。",
    "tldr": "因为互联网的巨大变化，1996年通过《通信廉正法》规定的互联网实体免责制度需要进行重新考虑和调整。",
    "en_tdlr": "Due to the internet's significant evolution over the past two decades, the immunity of internet entities established under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in 1996 needs to be re-evaluated and adjusted."
