    "translated_abstract": "分析海洋声学环境是一个棘手的任务。背景噪声和可变的信道传输环境使得准确的船舶辐射噪声识别变得复杂。现有的识别系统在处理可变水下环境方面较为薄弱，因此在实际应用中表现令人失望。为了保持识别系统在各种水下环境下的鲁棒性，本文提出了一种自适应通用识别系统——AGNet（自适应通用网络）。通过将固定的小波参数转换为可学习的微观参数，AGNet学习了不同频率下水下声音的特性。其灵活微观的设计有助于捕获更多背景声学信息（例如背景噪声、水下传输通道）。为了利用小波谱图中的隐式信息，AGNet采用并行卷积注意力卷积神经网络（Convolutional Neural Network with Parallel Convolution Attention M）。",
