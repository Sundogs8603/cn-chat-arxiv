    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑在有限数量的簇的情况下，用标记随机块模型（LSBM）恢复隐藏的社群，其中簇大小随着物品总数$n$的增长而线性增长。在LSBM中，为每对物品（独立地）观测到一个标签。我们的目标是设计一种有效的算法，利用观测到的标签来恢复簇。为此，我们重新审视了关于期望被任何聚类算法误分类的物品数量的实例特定下界。我们提出了实例自适应聚类（IAC），这是第一个在期望和高概率下都能匹配这些下界表现的算法。IAC由一次谱聚类算法和一个迭代的基于似然的簇分配改进组成。这种方法基于实例特定的下界，不需要任何模型参数，包括簇的数量。通过仅执行一次谱聚类，IAC在计算和存储方面都是高效的。",
