    "abstract": "Bokeh effect is an optical phenomenon that offers a pleasant visual experience, typically generated by high-end cameras with wide aperture lenses. The task of bokeh effect transformation aims to produce a desired effect in one set of lenses and apertures based on another combination. Current models are limited in their ability to render a specific set of bokeh effects, primarily transformations from sharp to blur. In this paper, we propose a novel universal method for embedding lens metadata into the model and introducing a loss calculation method using alpha masks from the newly released Bokeh Effect Transformation Dataset(BETD) [3]. Based on the above techniques, we propose the BokehOrNot model, which is capable of producing both blur-to-sharp and sharp-to-blur bokeh effect with various combinations of lenses and aperture sizes. Our proposed model outperforms current leading bokeh rendering and image restoration models and renders visually natural bokeh effects. Our code is available",

    "translated_abstract": "Bokeh效果是高端相机与广角镜头所产生的一种视觉效应，提供了愉悦的视觉体验。Bokeh效果的转换任务旨在根据另一组镜头与光圈的组合来产生期望的效果。目前的模型在渲染特定的Bokeh效果方面存在局限性，主要是从清晰到模糊的转换。本文提出了一种新的通用方法，将镜头元数据嵌入模型，并使用新发布的Bokeh效果转换数据集（BETD）[3]中的α掩模计算损失。基于上述技术，我们提出了BokehOrNot模型，它能够产生具有不同镜头和光圈尺寸组合的模糊到清晰和清晰到模糊的Bokeh效果。我们提出的模型优于当前领先的Bokeh渲染和图像恢复模型，并呈现出自然的Bokeh效果。我们的代码可用。",
