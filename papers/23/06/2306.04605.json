    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has made outstanding strides in recent years, with a good-sized impact on software product management. Drawing on pertinent articles from 2016 to 2023, this systematic literature evaluation reveals generative AI's potential applications, benefits, and constraints in this area. The study shows that technology can assist in idea generation, market research, customer insights, product requirements engineering, and product development. It can help reduce development time and costs through automatic code generation, customer feedback analysis, and more. However, the technology's accuracy, reliability, and ethical consideration persist. Ultimately, generative AI's practical application can significantly improve software product management activities, leading to more efficient use of resources, better product outcomes, and improved end-user experiences.",
