    "translated_abstract": "这项开创性研究探讨了高等教育背景下，AI和抄袭合体所涉及的新兴学术不端行为“AI-giarism”的学生认知。共有来自不同学科的393名本科和研究生参与了调查，受访者针对多种AI-giarism情境表达了不同的看法。研究结果揭示了一个复杂的认知格局，明确反对直接生成AI内容，但对于更微妙的AI使用方式则持更为暧昧态度。该研究引入了一种新型工具——作为AI-giarism的初始概念化——为教育工作者和政策制定者提供了重要支持。该量具有助于理解和探讨与AI有关的学术不端行为，有助于在AI集成时进行教学设计和评估。此外，它还挑战了传统的学术不端行为定义，强调了根据不断发展的AI技术进行适应的必要性。尽管存在限制，例如具有样本偏差等问题，但是该研究仍然具有重要意义。",
