    "translated_abstract": "开放世界目标检测(OWOD)是一项具有挑战性且现实的任务，超越了标准目标检测任务的范围。它需要在检测已知和未知对象的同时，整合学习到的知识用于未来的任务。然而，“未知性”在不同上下文中有很大的变化。例如，在自动驾驶场景中，树通常被认为是背景的一部分，但在家庭环境中可能具有重要性。我们认为这种上下文信息应该已经嵌入到已知类别中。换句话说，已知和未知项之间应该存在语义或潜在的结构关系等待发现。受到这一观察的启发，我们提出了Hyp-OW，一种通过超类正则化器来学习和建模已知项目的层次表示的方法。利用这种表示，我们可以通过基于相似度距离的重新标记模块有效地检测未知对象。大量实验证明了我们方法的有效性。",
