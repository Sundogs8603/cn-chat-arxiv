    "translated_abstract": "相变是复杂系统中突发转变的特征，尽管在物理和自然科学中已经进行了大量研究，但在社会系统中对这一现象的实证研究相对较少。本研究的目标是探索集体社会动荡的动力学是否可以被合理地描述为一系列循环相变，其中每个阶段具有可测量和可识别的潜在特征。我们引入了一个宏观水平的社会动荡统计模型，并使用包括1946年至2017年在内的170个国家的全面数据集来评估其可行性。我们的研究结果表明，这个宏观相变模型有效地捕捉到了全球各国社会动荡数据的特征，并且普遍的机制可能潜在地支撑着社会动荡的某些方面。我们还引入了一个新的量表来衡量一个国家的社会动荡程度。",
