    "abstract": "Active learning algorithms have been an integral part of recent advances in artificial intelligence. However, the research in the field is widely varying and lacks an overall organizing leans. We outline a Markovian formalism for the field of active learning and survey the literature to demonstrate the organizing capability of our proposed formalism. Our formalism takes a partially observable Markovian system approach to the active learning process as a whole. We specifically outline how querying, dataset augmentation, reward updates, and other aspects of active learning can be viewed as a transition between meta-states in a Markovian system, and give direction into how other aspects of active learning can fit into our formalism.",

    "translated_abstract": "主动学习算法是人工智能领域中最近进展的重要部分。然而，该领域的研究变化很大，缺乏整体性的组织结构。我们提出了一个基于马尔可夫系统的形式化主义，用于对主动学习领域进行概述，并通过文献综述来展示我们所提出的形式化主义的组织能力。我们的形式化主义将主动学习过程作为一个部分可观察的马尔可夫系统的整体来处理。我们具体概述了查询、数据集增强、奖励更新以及其他主动学习方面如何视为马尔可夫系统中元状态之间的转移，并指导其他主动学习方面如何适应我们的形式化主义。",
