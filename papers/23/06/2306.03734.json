    "abstract": "While natural languages differ widely in both canonical word order and word order flexibility, their word orders still follow shared cross-linguistic statistical patterns, often attributed to functional pressures. In the effort to identify these pressures, prior work has compared real and counterfactual word orders. Yet one functional pressure has been overlooked in such investigations: the uniform information density (UID) hypothesis, which holds that information should be spread evenly throughout an utterance. Here, we ask whether a pressure for UID may have influenced word order patterns cross-linguistically. To this end, we use computational models to test whether real orders lead to greater information uniformity than counterfactual orders. In our empirical study of 10 typologically diverse languages, we find that: (i) among SVO languages, real word orders consistently have greater uniformity than reverse word orders, and (ii) only linguistically implausible counterfactual orders ",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管自然语言在基本词序和词序灵活性方面差异很大，但它们的词序仍然遵循共享的跨语言统计模式，这通常归因于功能压力。在识别这些压力的努力中，以前的研究比较了真实和反事实的词序。然而，在这些调查中，有一个功能压力被忽视了，即统一信息密度假设，该假设认为信息应该在话语中均匀分布。在这里，我们询问是否跨语言地存在信息密度统一的压力可能会影响词序模式。为此，我们使用计算模型测试真实顺序是否比反事实顺序导致更大的信息统一性。在我们对10种类型多样的语言进行的实证研究中，我们发现：（i）在SVO语言中，真实的词序一致比反向的词序具有更大的统一性，（ii）只有语言上不合理的反事实顺序...",
