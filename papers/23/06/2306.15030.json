    "translated_abstract": "标准化流是一类特别适用于物理学中概率分布建模的深度生成模型。其中，流的准确似然性质可以实现对已知目标能量函数的加权重重和无偏观测量的计算。例如，Boltzmann生成器通过训练流生成处于平衡状态的多体系统（如小分子和蛋白质）样本，解决了统计物理学中长期存在的采样问题。为了构建有效的模型，也很关键将目标能量的对称性纳入模型中，这可以通过等变连续标准化流（CNF）来实现。然而，CNF的训练和样本生成的计算开销较大，这限制了它们的可扩展性和实际应用。在本文中，我们引入了等变流匹配，一种新的等变CNF训练目标，其基于最近提出的最优输运流匹配方法。",
