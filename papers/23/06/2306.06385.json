    "translated_abstract": "对建筑能源使用进行预测对于促进可持续发展和减少浪费至关重要，因为它使建筑管理者能够优化能源消耗并降低成本。这一重要性在异常期间被放大，例如COVID-19大流行期间，它扰乱了入住模式，使准确的预测更具挑战性。在异常期间预测能源使用是困难的，因为入住模式和能源使用行为发生变化。其中一个主要原因是入住模式分布的转变，许多人在家工作或学习。这就产生了对能够适应变化的入住模式的新预测方法的需求。在线学习已经成为解决这个挑战的有希望的解决方案，因为它使建筑管理者能够适应入住模式的变化，并相应地调整能源使用。通过在线学习，模型可以以每个新数据点为基础进行增量更新，使其能够不断学习。",
