    "translated_abstract": "已知将一个 $N \\times M$ 矩阵与一个 $M \\times P$ 的矩阵相乘时，可以使用少于朴素 $NMP$ 方法建议的乘法次数。其中最著名的是 Strassen 算法，可将两个 $2\\times 2$ 的矩阵相乘，只需 7 次而非 8 次乘法。这引出了快速矩阵乘法的约束满足问题，其中必须选择一组 $R <NMP$ 乘法项，并将它们组合以满足输出矩阵的正确性约束。本文提出了一种简单而新颖的基于约束编程的方法，以寻找快速矩阵乘法的非交换算法或提供不可行性证明。我们提出了一组打破对称性的约束条件和有效的不等式约束来修剪搜索空间，并减少要检查的解决方案数量。我们的实验表明，在合理的时间内，我们的方法可以找到已知的最佳算法或改进的算法，适用于测试的所有矩阵大小，最大为 $768 \\times 768$。",

By breaking the symmetry constraints and using valid inequality constraints to prune the search space, our method can find the best-known or improved algorithms in a reasonable amount of time for all tested matrix sizes up to 768x768."
