    "translated_abstract": "学习高质量的 Q 值函数在许多现代离线深度强化学习 (RL) 算法的成功中起着关键作用。之前的研究集中解决采用函数逼近器和离线学习所导致的值过高的问题。与这种普遍观点不同，我们观察到 Q 值在 RL 训练过程的后期实际上被低估了，主要是由于贝尔曼更新中，当前策略使用比回放缓冲区中更优的动作样本差。我们假设这个长期被忽视的现象可能阻碍了策略学习，降低了样本效率。我们的想法是在保持探索乐观性的同时，结合充分利用过去成功的经验。我们提出了混合利用和探索 (BEE) 操作符，这是一种简单而有效的方法，使用历史上表现最佳的动作和当前策略生成的动作来更新 Q 值。",
