In this context, this work proposes an automatic system for detecting depression on social media based on machine learning and natural language processing methods. This paper presents the following contributions: (i) an ensemble learning system that combines several types of text representations for depression detection, including recent advances in the field; (ii) a contextualization schema through topic and affective information; (iii) an analysis of models' energy consumption, establishing a trade-off between classification performance and overall computational costs. To assess the proposed models' effectiveness, a thorough evaluation is performed in two datasets that model depressive text.

    "translated_abstract": "抑郁是社会心理健康中日益严重的问题，影响生活的各个方面，甚至可能导致自杀。幸运的是，预防计划可以在抑郁的治疗中起到作用。在这个背景下，本文提出了一种基于机器学习和自然语言处理方法的社交媒体抑郁检测自动系统。本文提出了以下贡献：（i）一个将多种文本表示方式结合起来进行抑郁检测的集成学习系统，包括该领域的最新进展；（ii）通过主题和情感信息的情景化模式；（iii）分析模型的能耗，建立分类性能和总体计算成本之间的权衡。为了评估所提出模型的有效性，对两个模拟抑郁文本的数据集进行了全面评估。实验证明，所提出的情景化策略可以改善分类效果，并且应用于自己构建的数据集表明，该方法在检测抑郁风险方面优于目前的方法。",
