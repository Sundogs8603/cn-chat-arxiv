    "translated_abstract": "仅依赖于成对关系的模型往往无法捕捉到各种领域（如社会经济、生态或生物医学系统）中找到的复杂多变量数据的完整统计结构。两个以上变量组之间的非平凡依赖关系在这些系统的分析和建模中可以发挥重要作用，但从数据中提取这样的高阶相互作用仍然具有挑战性。本文引入了一系列$d$-order ($d \\geq 2$)相互作用测量，依次包括可能的联合概率分布分解，并定义了非参数、基于核的测试，以系统地确定$d$-order相互作用的统计显着性。同时，我们建立了与格理论的数学联系，阐明了相互作用度量的导出及其复合排列测试的涵义；澄清了单纯复合体与核矩阵中心化的联系；并提供了一种增强相互作用模型的方法。",
