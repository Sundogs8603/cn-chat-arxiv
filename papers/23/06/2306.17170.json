    "translated_abstract": "作为人工智能的一个特定类别，生成型人工智能（GenAI）生成类似于人类创造的新内容。GenAI系统的快速发展已经在互联网上产生了大量的新数据，给当前的计算和通信框架带来了新的挑战。目前，由于需要大量的计算资源，GenAI服务依赖于传统的云计算框架。然而，由于数据传输和大量请求，这种服务将遇到高延迟的问题。另一方面，通过边缘和云之间的协同，边缘云计算可以提供足够的计算能力和低延迟。因此，在边缘云计算范式的支持下构建规模化的GenAI系统具有吸引力。在本综述论文中，我们分别回顾了GenAI和边缘云计算的最新发展。然后，我们使用两个示例性的GenAI应用来讨论技术挑战和未来研究方向。",
