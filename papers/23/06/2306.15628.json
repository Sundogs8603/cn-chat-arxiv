    "translated_abstract": "中性原子器件利用光镊排列原子和调制激光脉冲控制量子态，代表了一种有前景的技术。Pasqal发展了一种使用铷原子的中性原子噪声中等规模量子（NISQ）设备，可处理多达100个量子比特。所有NISQ设备都受到噪声的影响，这对计算结果有着一定影响。因此，更好地了解和表征噪声源并可能纠正它们非常重要。本文提出了两种方法来表征和校正中性原子NISQ设备上的噪声参数。特别关注Pasqal设备，并采用机器学习（ML）技术来实现这些目标。为了表征噪声参数，训练了多个ML模型，只使用原子最终量子态的测量结果作为输入，来预测激光强度波动和腰围、温度以及假阳性和假阴性测量值等。",
