    "translated_abstract": "会话式推荐系统 (CRS) 通过多轮交互，动态引导用户表达偏好，有效地解决信息不对称问题。现有的 CRS 基本上假设用户有明确的偏好。在这种情况下，代理将完全信任用户反馈，并将接受或拒绝信号视为过滤项目和减少候选空间的强指标，这可能导致过滤过度的问题。然而，在现实中，用户的偏好往往是模糊和波动的，存在不确定性，他们在交互过程中的愿望和决策可能会发生变化。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一个新颖的场景，称为“模糊偏好多轮会话推荐”（VPMCR），它考虑到用户在 CRS 中的模糊和波动的偏好。VPMCR 采用软估计机制为所有候选项目分配非零置信度分数，自然地避免了过滤过度的问题。在 VPMCR 设置中，我们提出了一种自适应模糊偏好策略学习框架，利用强化学习和偏好引导来学习 CRS 代理的最优策略。在两个真实数据集上的实验结果表明，相较于几种最先进的基准方法，我们提出的 VPMCR 方法具有更好的推荐效果。",

VPMCR employs a soft estimation mechanism to naturally avoid over-filtering and introduces an adaptive vague preference policy learning framework that leverages reinforcement learning and preference elicitation to achieve better recommendation performance compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods."
