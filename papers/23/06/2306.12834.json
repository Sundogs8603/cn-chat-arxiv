However, the lack of annotated data, automated tools, and other challenges hinder the full utilisation of NLP for EHRs. Various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and NLP techniques are studied and compared to understand the limitations and opportunities in this space comprehensively.  Methodology: After screening 261 articles from 11 databases, we included 127 papers for full-text review covering seven categories of articles: 1) medical note classification, 2) clinical entity recognition, 3) text summarisation, 4) deep learning (DL) and transfer learning architecture, 5) information extraction, 6) Medical language translation and 7) other NLP applications. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

    "translated_abstract": "背景：自然语言处理（NLP）广泛用于从电子病历（EHR）中提取临床见解，但缺乏注释数据，自动化工具和其他挑战使得全面利用NLP进行EHR受到阻碍。本文研究并比较了各种机器学习（ML），深度学习（DL）和NLP技术，以全面了解这个领域的限制和机会。 方法：在筛选了11个数据库中的261篇文章后，我们选择了127篇文章进行全文审查，涵盖了七类文章：1）医学笔记分类，2）临床实体识别，3）文本摘要，4）深度学习（DL）和迁移学习架构，5）信息提取，6）医疗语言翻译和7）其他NLP应用程序。这项研究遵循了系统评述和Meta分析的报告首选项目（PRISMA）指南。 结果和讨论：EHR是所选文章中最常用的数据类型。研究发现，在医疗决策任务（如医学笔记分类，临床实体识别和EHR中的信息提取）中，NLP技术取得了有希望的结果。然而，仍然存在挑战，如缺乏标准化数据和需要特定领域的模型。研究建议需要进一步努力改进NLP模型在临床决策中的性能和通用性。",
