    "translated_abstract": "尽管已经提出了许多方法来计算欧几里得空间概率分布之间的距离，但是相对于计算这样的距离在图上分布的情况下却给予了相对较少的关注。然而，在生物医学科学领域，无论是位于图上（如蛋白质相互作用网络）还是可被建模为图的数据（单细胞数据）都有显著增加。因此，重要的是要找到比较定义在这种图上的信号的方法。在这里，我们提出了一种新的分布和图上信号之间的距离，称为图傅里叶移动距离（GFMMD）。GFMMD通过一个最优的见证函数进行定义，这个函数既在图上平滑，又最大化了在图上的两个分布之间的期望差异。我们发现了这个优化问题的一个解析解以及由该方法产生的分布嵌入。我们还证明了该方法的几个性质，包括尺度不变性和适用于一般图形。我们在合成和真实数据集上对GFMMD进行了实证评估，并显示它优于现有比较图信号方法。",

Empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets shows that GFMMD outperforms existing methods."
