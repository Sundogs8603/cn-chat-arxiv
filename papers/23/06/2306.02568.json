    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种统一方法，使用动态规划和Gumbel传播在变分自编码器（VAE）的潜在空间中获取结构化稀疏最优路径。我们通过概率软化解，即随机最优路径，来解决经典最优路径问题，并将广泛的DP问题转化为有向无环图，其中所有可能的路径遵循Gibbs分布。我们通过Gumbel分布的属性显示Gibbs分布与消息传递算法的等价性，并提供了变分贝叶斯推理所需的所有要素。我们的方法获取了潜在最优路径，使生成任务的端到端训练成为可能，其中模型依赖于未观察到的结构特征的信息。我们验证了我们方法的行为，并展示了其在两个真实世界应用中的适用性：文本转语音和歌声合成。",
