    "abstract": "For reinforcement learning systems to be widely adopted, their users must understand and trust them. We present a theoretical analysis of explaining reinforcement learning using Shapley values, following a principled approach from game theory for identifying the contribution of individual players to the outcome of a cooperative game. We call this general framework Shapley Values for Explaining Reinforcement Learning (SVERL). Our analysis exposes the limitations of earlier uses of Shapley values in reinforcement learning. We then develop an approach that uses Shapley values to explain agent performance. In a variety of domains, SVERL produces meaningful explanations that match and supplement human intuition.",

    "translated_abstract": "要想广泛采用强化学习系统，用户必须理解并信任它们。我们提出了使用Shapley值解释强化学习的理论分析，该分析遵循博弈论的原则，用于确定个体玩家对合作博弈结果的贡献。我们称之为Shapley Values for Explaining Reinforcement Learning (SVERL)的一般框架。我们的分析揭示了以前在强化学习中使用Shapley值的局限性，然后我们开发了一种使用Shapley值解释代理性能的方法。在各种领域中，SVERL提供了有意义的解释，匹配并补充了人类的直观认识。",
