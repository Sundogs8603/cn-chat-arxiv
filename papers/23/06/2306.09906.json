    "abstract": "Bird sound classification is the task of relating any sound recording to those species of bird that can be heard in the recording. Here, we study bird sound clustering, the task of deciding for any pair of sound recordings whether the same species of bird can be heard in both. We address this problem by first learning, from a training set, probabilities of pairs of recordings being related in this way, and then inferring a maximally probable partition of a test set by correlation clustering. We address the following questions: How accurate is this clustering, compared to a classification of the test set? How do the clusters thus inferred relate to the clusters obtained by classification? How accurate is this clustering when applied to recordings of bird species not heard during training? How effective is this clustering in separating, from bird sounds, environmental noise not heard during training?",

    "translated_abstract": "鸟类声音分类是将任何声音记录与可以在记录中听到的鸟类物种相关联的任务。在这里，我们研究鸟声聚类，即决定任何一对声音记录是否可以听到相同的鸟类物种。我们首先从训练集中学习记录对按这种方式相关的概率，然后通过相关聚类来推断测试集的最大可能分区。我们解决以下问题：与测试集的分类相比，这种聚类的准确性如何？从分类获得的聚类如何与因此推断得出的聚类相关？在应用于训练期间未听到的鸟类物种的记录时，这种聚类的准确性如何？这种聚类在分离鸟鸣声和训练期间未听到的环境噪声方面有多有效？",
    "tldr": "本文研究鸟声聚类问题，提出了一种通过学习训练集中记录对相关概率后，应用相关聚类于测试集进行聚类的方法，并比较了这种方法与测试集分类的准确性和相关性。同时，还探究了这种方法在应用于训练期间未听到的鸟类物种的记录以及分离鸟声和环境噪声方面的效果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the problem of bird sound clustering. A method is proposed to learn the probabilities of related pairs from the training set and apply correlation clustering to the test set. The accuracy and relationship between this method and classification are compared. Also, the effectiveness in applying to recordings of bird species not heard during training and separating bird sound from environmental noise is investigated."
