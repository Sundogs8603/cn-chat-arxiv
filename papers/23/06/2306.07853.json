    "translated_abstract": "由于自适应学习环境种类繁多，因此找到哪些适应措施对于哪些学习领域是有意义的至关重要。我们的工作呈现了在一个在线平台上进行的实验的结果，该平台旨在通过机器学习为基础的面向学生的干预措施来提高学习德语拼写技能。我们将传统的在线学习平台与该平台的三个不同的自适应版本进行了比较，这些版本实现了向学生展示个性化解决方案概率的干预措施。我们评估了不同的干预措施，关注错误率、辍学率和用户能力。我们的结果显示，错误次数相比对照组有所减少。此外，我们发现辍学人数也在增加。我们没有发现任何对于用户能力的显著影响。我们得出结论：面向学生的自适应学习环境可以有效提高个人错误率，应谨慎选择，以发挥激励作用。",
