    "abstract": "Abstract. When writing an academic paper, researchers often spend considerable time reviewing and summarizing papers to extract relevant citations and data to compose the Introduction and Related Work sections. To address this problem, we propose QuOTeS, an interactive system designed to retrieve sentences related to a summary of the research from a collection of potential references and hence assist in the composition of new papers. QuOTeS integrates techniques from Query-Focused Extractive Summarization and High-Recall Information Retrieval to provide Interactive Query-Focused Summarization of scientific documents. To measure the performance of our system, we carried out a comprehensive user study where participants uploaded papers related to their research and evaluated the system in terms of its usability and the quality of the summaries it produces. The results show that QuOTeS provides a positive user experience and consistently provides query-focused summaries that are relevant,",
