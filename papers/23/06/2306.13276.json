    "translated_abstract": "磁共振成像（MRI）由于显示出优秀的软组织对比度，被认为是医学成像的黄金标准，这使得人类放射学家能够轻松地识别许多病变。最近，深度学习（DL）模型也使用这些重建图像作为输入，在诊断多种疾病方面取得了最先进的性能。然而，MRI管道内的图像重建过程需要使用复杂的硬件，并调整大量的扫描仪参数，因此对各种形式的噪声高度敏感，导致图像中出现任意的伪影。此外，噪声分布不是固定的，在机器内、机器之间和患者之间变化，导致图像中的伪影也随之不同。不幸的是，DL模型对这些不同的伪影非常敏感，因为它导致输入数据分布发生变化。",
    "tldr": "本研究研究了自动磁共振影像诊断中归一化方案对输入分布转移的灵敏度和鲁棒性问题，因为MRI管道内的图像重建过程对各种形式的噪声高度敏感，导致图像中出现任意的伪影，噪声分布不是固定的，而且因为DL模型对这些不同的伪影非常敏感，所以本研究是极其有意义的。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates the sensitivity and robustness of normalization schemes to input distribution shifts in automatic MR image diagnosis, as the image reconstruction process within the MRI pipeline is highly susceptible to noise of various forms, resulting in arbitrary artifacts within the images, and DL models are quite sensitive to these varying artifacts, making this study highly significant."
