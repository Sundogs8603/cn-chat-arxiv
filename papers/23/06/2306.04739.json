    "translated_abstract": "在重症监护病房(ICU)长期卧床的危重病患者中，骨骼肌萎缩是常见的情况。必须通过物理治疗恢复肌肉质量，然后才能出院。超声成像通常用于测量肌肉尺寸的变化，以评估恢复过程。然而，由于扫描通常在不同的日期进行，而且可能由不同的操作员进行，因此这些手动测量容易产生较大的变异性。在本文中，我们提出了一种自监督对比学习方法，以自动检索不同时间扫描的相似超声肌肉视图。使用从67名ICU患者获取的数据对比了三种不同的模型。结果表明，我们的对比模型在视图检索任务中表现优于监督基准模型，具有73.52%的AUC值，当与自动分割模型结合使用时，其横截面积误差为5.7%+/-0.24%。",
