This transformation is achieved by embedding a Markovian \"memory process\" within the dynamics of the non-Markovian process. We discuss existence and path-wise regularity of solutions for the stochastic Volterra equations introduced and we provide a financial application to volatility modeling. We also propose a numerical scheme for simulating the processes. The numerical scheme exhibits a strong convergence rate of 1/2, which is independent of the roughness parameter of the volatility process. This is a significant improvement compared to Euler schemes used in similar models.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新的理论框架，利用卷积核将Volterra路径依赖（非马尔可夫）随机过程转化为标准（马尔可夫）扩散过程，将马尔可夫“内存过程”嵌入到非马尔可夫过程的动力学中以达到这一转化。我们讨论了引入的随机Volterra方程的解的存在性和路径正则性，并提供了一个用于波动率建模的金融应用。我们还提出了一个模拟这些过程的数值计算方案。该数值计算方案呈现出1/2的强收敛速率，与波动率过程的粗糙性参数无关，这与类似模型中使用的Euler方案相比是一个显着的改进。",
