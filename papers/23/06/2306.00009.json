    "translated_abstract": "实际工业推荐系统的候选项生成（检索）、排序和再排序大致分为三个阶段。个人层面的多样性和系统层面的多样性对于工业推荐系统同样重要。前者关注每个用户的体验，而后者关注用户之间的差异。基于图形的检索策略不可避免地被重度用户和热门项目所劫持，导致用户之间的候选项收敛和系统层面的多样性缺乏。同时，在再排序阶段，采用析因点过程（DPP）来增加个人层面的多样性。DPP高度依赖于项目的语义信息，容易受到标题党和不准确属性的影响。此外，大多数研究仅关注其中一种多样性层面，并忽略了实际推荐系统中不同阶段之间的相互影响。我们认为应该将个人层面的多样性和系统层面的多样性视为一个整体，并提出一种基于图形探索的方法，通过探索包含用户和项目的社交图形来提高两种多样性，从而捕捉用户对不同项目和项目自身属性的固有偏好。我们在微信资讯推荐数据集上进行了实验，结果表明我们的方法在个人层面和系统层面的多样性以及用户参与度方面均优于强基线。",
