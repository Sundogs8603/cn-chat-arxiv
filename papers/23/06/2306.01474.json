    "translated_abstract": "生物学和药物开发中的许多过程涉及不同分子之间的各种3D相互作用，例如蛋白质与蛋白质，蛋白质与小分子等。设计一个通用模型来学习普适的分子相互作用具有重要价值，但也具有挑战性，因为不同的分子通常以不同粒度表示。本文首先提出了将3D分子通用表示为集合的几何图形图，与传统单层表示形式形成对比。在提出的统一表示下，我们提出了通用等变Transformer（GET），以有效地捕捉稀疏块级和密集原子级交互。具体而言，GET由双层注意力模块、前馈模块和层归一化模块组成，值得注意的是，每个模块都是E（3）等变的，以满足3D世界的对称性。在预测蛋白质-蛋白质亲和力、配体结合亲和力和配体效力方面进行了大量实验，表明GET优于各种最先进的方法。",
