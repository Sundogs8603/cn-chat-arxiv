    "translated_abstract": "我们利用Stein方法推导出了基于Wasserstein距离（$W_1$）的上界，该距离是连续随机场与高斯分布之间的距离。我们开发了一种新颖的高斯平滑技术，使我们能够将平滑度量中的上界转化为$W_1$距离。平滑性是基于使用Laplacian算子的幂构建的协方差函数，设计成与Cameron-Martin或Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space相关联的高斯过程具有易操作的特征。这个特征使我们能够超越之前文献中考虑的一维区间型指标集。通过特化我们的一般结果，我们获得了在任意深度和Lipschitz激活函数的广义随机神经网络中对高斯随机场逼近的首个上界。我们的上界明确地用网络宽度和随机权重的矩来表示。",
