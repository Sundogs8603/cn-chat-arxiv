    "translated_abstract": "情感-原因对提取（ECPE）旨在从文档中提取所有情感子句及其相应的原因子句。现有方法通过多任务学习（MTL）框架来解决这一任务，在该框架中，这两个子任务为ECPE提供了指示性的线索。然而，以前的MTL框架仅考虑了一轮多任务推理，忽略了从ECPE到子任务的反馈。此外，其多任务推理仅依赖于语义水平的交互，无法捕捉显式依赖关系，而编码器共享和多任务隐藏状态级联也难以捕捉因果关系。为了解决这些问题，我们首先提出了一种基于协同演化推理的新MTL框架。它（1）模拟了ECPE与其子任务之间的双向反馈；（2）允许三个任务一起演化，并相互引导；（3）集成预测级别的交互来捕捉显式依赖关系。然后我们提出了一个新的Co-evolving Graph Reasoning Network（CGRN），来实现Co-evolving Reasoning MTL框架。CGRN在三个任务及其输入之间构建了一个异构图，通过图推理过程自然地捕捉了因果关系和显式依赖关系。在两个ECPE基准测试上的实验证明了我们的CGRN明显优于最先进的方法。",
