    "translated_abstract": "生成式信息检索（IR）在多个研究社区（例如信息检索、计算机视觉、自然语言处理和机器学习）中得到了显著增长，并在流行媒体上备受关注。已发布了理论、实证和实际用户产品，这些产品可以通过生成文档（通过生成）或直接生成答案来检索文档或回答输入请求。我们想调查端到端生成模型是否只是另一种趋势，还是像某些人所声称的那样，是IR的范式转变。这需要新的指标、理论基础、评估方法、任务定义、模型、用户界面等。本次研讨会的目标是关注先前探索过的生成式IR技术，如文档检索和直接实现的基础答案生成，同时也提供一个地点用于探讨和探索生成式IR如何应用于推荐等新领域。",
