Specifically, we pre-train a diffusion model in a fully unsupervised manner on a prior velocity model distribution that represents our expectations of the subsurface and then adapt it to the seismic observations by incorporating the FWI into the sampling process of the generative diffusion models.

    "translated_abstract": "全波形反演（FWI）具有提供高分辨率地下模型估计的潜力，但由于观测限制（例如区域噪声、有限的震源或接收器以及带限数据），很难使用FWI得到所需的高分辨率模型。为了应对这个挑战，我们提出了一种使用生成扩散模型正则化FWI的新范式。具体而言，我们以完全无监督的方式在先前的速度模型分布上预先训练扩散模型，该分布代表了我们对地下的预期，并将FWI并入生成扩散模型的采样过程中，将其适应于地震观测。扩散模型之所以独特适合这种实现，是因为其生成过程保留了速度模型的形式和尺寸。数值实例证明，我们的方法可以在仅有微不足道的额外计算成本的情况下优于传统的FWI。即使在只有少量观测数据的情况下，我们的方法也可以提供高分辨率。",
