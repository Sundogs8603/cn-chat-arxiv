    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in automation systems are usually distributed systems whose development and integration involve several experts. Each expert uses its own domain-specific modeling language and tools to model the system elements. An interdisciplinary graphical modeling language that enables the modeling of an AI application as an overall system comprehensible to all disciplines does not yet exist. As a result, there is often a lack of interdisciplinary system understanding, leading to increased development, integration, and maintenance efforts. This paper therefore presents a graphical modeling language that enables consistent and understandable modeling of AI applications in automation systems at system level. This makes it possible to subdivide individual subareas into domain specific subsystems and thus reduce the existing efforts.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动化系统中的人工智能应用通常是分布式系统，其开发和集成涉及多个专家。每个专家使用自己的领域特定建模语言和工具来模拟系统元素。目前尚不存在一种跨学科的图形建模语言，能够将人工智能应用作为整体系统进行建模，使所有学科都能够理解。因此，本论文提出了一种图形建模语言，能够在系统级别上对自动化系统中的人工智能应用进行一致和可理解的建模。这使得可以将各个子领域分成特定领域的子系统，从而减少现有的工作量。",
