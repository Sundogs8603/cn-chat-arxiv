There has been very little research on Chinese text simplification for a long time. The lack of generic evaluation data is an essential reason for this phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce MCTS, a multi-reference Chinese text simplification dataset. We describe the annotation process of the dataset and provide a detailed analysis. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of several unsupervised methods and advanced large language models. We additionally provide Chinese text simplification parallel data that can be used for training, acquired by utilizing machine translation and English text simplification. We hope to build a basic understanding of Chinese text simplification through the foundational work and provide references for future research. All of the code and data are released at https://github.com/blcuicall/mcts/.",

    "translated_abstract": "文本简化旨在通过应用重写转换使文本更容易理解。长期以来，关于中文文本简化的研究很少。通用评估数据的缺乏是这种现象的一个重要原因。本文介绍了MCTS，一个多参考的中文文本简化数据集。我们描述了数据集的注释过程并提供了详细分析。此外，我们评估了几种无监督方法和先进的大型语言模型的性能。我们还提供了可以用于训练的中文文本简化平行数据，通过利用机器翻译和英文文本简化获得。我们希望通过基础工作建立对中文文本简化的基本理解，并为未来的研究提供参考。所有的代码和数据已在https://github.com/blcuicall/mcts/发布。",
