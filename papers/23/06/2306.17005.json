    "abstract": "The goal of Automatic Voice Over (AVO) is to generate speech in sync with a silent video given its text script. Recent AVO frameworks built upon text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) have shown impressive results. However, the current AVO learning objective of acoustic feature reconstruction brings in indirect supervision for inter-modal alignment learning, thus limiting the synchronization performance and synthetic speech quality. To this end, we propose a novel AVO method leveraging the learning objective of self-supervised discrete speech unit prediction, which not only provides more direct supervision for the alignment learning, but also alleviates the mismatch between the text-video context and acoustic features. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves remarkable lip-speech synchronization and high speech quality by outperforming baselines in both objective and subjective evaluations. Code and speech samples are publicly available.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动配音（AVO）的目标是根据静音视频的文本脚本生成与之同步的语音。最近的AVO框架建立在文本到语音合成（TTS）之上，取得了令人印象深刻的结果。然而，当前AVO的学习目标是声学特征重建，为跨模态对齐学习带来了间接监督，从而限制了同步性能和合成语音质量。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的AVO方法，利用自监督离散语音单元预测的学习目标，不仅为对齐学习提供了更直接的监督，还减轻了文本-视频上下文与声学特征之间的不匹配。实验结果表明，我们提出的方法通过在客观和主观评估中优于基准方法，实现了卓越的嘴唇-语音同步和高质量的语音。代码和语音样本已公开提供。",
