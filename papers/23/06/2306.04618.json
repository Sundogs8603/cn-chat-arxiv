    "translated_abstract": "本文重新审视自然语言处理(NLP)领域中领域外鲁棒性(OOD)的研究。我们发现以往研究中的分布转移设置普遍缺乏足够的挑战，限制了对OOD鲁棒性的准确评估。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个基准构建方案，确保了明确的区分和具有挑战性的分布转移。然后，我们介绍了BOSS，一个涵盖5个任务和20个数据集的用于评估OOT鲁棒性的基准套件。基于BOSS，我们对预训练语言模型进行了一系列实验，以分析和评估OOD鲁棒性。首先，我们研究了香草微调的ID和OOD性能之间的关系。我们确定了三种典型类型揭示了内在的学习机制，可能有助于预测OOD鲁棒性，并与ID数据集上的进展相关。然后，我们在BOSS上评估了5种经典方法，并发现它们的OOD性能并不总是与ID性能一致，这表明了特别评估OOD鲁棒性的重要性。最后，我们提出了一种名为LLMs（潜在语言模型）的新方法，可以在多个任务上显著提高OOD鲁棒性。",

By using this benchmark suite, the authors find that the relationship between OOD and ID performance is not always consistent and introduce a novel method named LLMs, which significantly improves OOD robustness on multiple tasks."
