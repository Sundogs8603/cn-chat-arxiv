    "translated_abstract": "在过去的几年中，自然语言处理（NLP）和自动化机器学习（AutoML）领域取得了显著的成果。特别是在NLP领域，巨型语言模型（LLMs）最近经历了一系列突破。我们设想，两个领域通过紧密的融合可以彼此推动极限。为了展示这一愿景，我们探索了AutoML和LLMs之间的共生关系潜力，着重探讨了它们如何互相受益。我们特别研究了从不同角度增强LLMs的AutoML方法的机会以及利用AutoML进一步改进LLMs的挑战。为此，我们调查了现有工作，并对其中的风险进行了批判性评估。我们坚信，两个领域的融合有可能颠覆NLP和AutoML两个领域。通过强调可想象的协同作用和风险，我们旨在促进在交叉点的进一步探索。",
