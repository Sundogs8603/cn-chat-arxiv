    "translated_abstract": "Back Translation (BT)技术被广泛应用于机器翻译领域，因为它被证明能够提高翻译质量。然而，由于BT数据的源语言部分是机器翻译的，所以BT主要改善共享相似风格输入（更具体地说，是类似翻译的输入）的翻译质量。对于自然输入，BT只能带来轻微的改进，有时甚至会带来不利的影响。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了文本风格转化的Back-Translation技术（TST BT），它使用风格转换模型来修改BT数据的源语言部分。通过使源语言部分的文本风格更自然，我们旨在改善自然输入的翻译质量。我们在不同的语言对上进行了实验，包括高资源和低资源的语言对，结果表明TST BT显著提高了翻译质量。此外，TST BT还证明在领域适应方面也非常有效，因此这种策略可以被视为一种通用的数据增强技术。",
