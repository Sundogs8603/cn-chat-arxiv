Advancing from foundation LLMs to instructionfollowing LLMs, instruction tuning plays a vital role in aligning LLMs to human preferences. However, the existing LLMs are usually focused on English, leading to inferior performance in non-English languages. In order to improve the performance for non-English languages, it is necessary to collect language-specific training data for foundation LLMs and construct language-specific instructions for instruction tuning, both of which are heavy loads. To minimize human workload, we propose to transfer the capabilities of language generation and instruction following from English to other languages through an interactive translation task.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）展示了惊人的语言理解和生成能力。从基础LLMs发展为指令追踪LLMs，指令调优在将LLMs与人类偏好对齐方面起着至关重要的作用。然而，现有的LLMs通常专注于英语，导致非英语语言表现较差。为了提高非英语语言的性能，需要收集基础LLMs的语言特定的训练数据，并构建语言特定的指令以进行指令调优，这两者都是沉重的负担。为了最小化人类工作量，我们提出通过交互式翻译任务将语言生成和指令遵循的能力从英语转移到其他语言。我们开发了BayLing，一种指令遵循LLM，利用LLaMA作为基础LLM，自动构建交互式翻译指令以进行指令调优。对英语、中文和西班牙语三种语言的广泛评估表明，BayLing在不需要语言特定数据或指令的情况下实现了与最先进的LLMs相当的性能。",
