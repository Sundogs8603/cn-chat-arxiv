    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种鲁棒可靠的生成模型评估指标，通过引入拓扑和统计处理进行严格的支持估计。现有的度量标准，如Inception Score（IS），Fr\\'echet Inception Distance（FID）以及Precision and Recall（P\\&R）的变体，严重依赖于从样本特征估计的支持。然而，尽管评估的质量完全取决于其可靠性，但其估计的可靠性并没有得到严肃的讨论（并被忽视）。本文提出了拓扑精度和召回率（TopP\\&R，发音为“topper”），它提供了一种系统的方法来估计支持，仅保留具有一定置信水平的具有拓扑和统计上重要性的特征。这不仅使TopP\\&R对于噪声特征具有强大的鲁棒性，而且还提供了统计一致性。我们的理论和实验结果表明，TopP\\&R对于离群值和非独立同分布具有鲁棒性。",
