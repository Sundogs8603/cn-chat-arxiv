    "translated_abstract": "对于非欧几里得数据，根据底层几何学习表示是至关重要的。研究表明，双曲空间可以有效地嵌入分层或树状数据。近年来，双曲神经网络得到了快速发展。然而，学习良好的双曲表示是有挑战的，因为常见的欧几里得神经操作（如卷积）无法扩展到双曲空间。大多数双曲神经网络不包括卷积操作，并忽略局部模式。其他的则仅使用非双曲卷积，或者缺失诸如置换等价性的重要性质。我们提出了HKConv，一种新颖且可训练的双曲卷积，它首先将可训练的本地双曲特征与放置在双曲空间中的固定核心点相关联，然后在本地邻域内聚合输出特征。HKConv不仅可以有效地学习本地特征，还可以根据双曲距离测量类似于旋转的变换等变性。",
