    "translated_abstract": "零样本学习（Zero-Shot Learning，ZSL）旨在自动识别未见过的物体，是机器持续理解新的现实世界知识的一种有前途的学习范式。知识图谱（Knowledge Graph, KG）被证明是一种有效的处理具有大规模和非属性数据的零样本任务的方案。先前的研究通常将已经知道和未知的对象之间的关系嵌入到已知知识图谱的视觉信息中，以提高未知数据的认知能力。实际上，现实世界的知识是由多模态事实自然形成的。与仅从图形角度考虑的普通结构知识相比，多模态 KG 可以为认知系统提供细粒度知识。例如，文本描述和视觉内容可以比仅依赖于知识三元组描述更多的关键细节。不幸的是，由于不同模态之间的特征对准的瓶颈，这种多模态细粒度的知识主要未被开发利用。",
