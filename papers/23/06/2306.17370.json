    "translated_abstract": "继隐私保护模型差分隐私（DP）近年来吸引了研究人员的极大关注后，目前机器学习与差分隐私的结合研究十分活跃。相比之下，另一种广泛使用的人工智能技术——群体智能算法，虽然也引发了隐私关切，但在差分隐私的背景下却鲜有研究关注。因此，本文首次尝试将差分隐私与群体智能结合，提出了一种通用的差分隐私群体智能算法框架（DPSIAF）。该框架基于指数机制，可以将现有的群体智能算法轻松发展为私有版本。作为示例，我们将提出的DPSIAF应用于四种常见的群体智能算法，并进行了相应的分析，证明了其有效性。更有趣的是，实验结果表明，对于我们的私有算法来说，其性能并不严格受到隐私预算的影响，",
