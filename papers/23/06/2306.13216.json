    "translated_abstract": "多样社区数据是美国国家标准和技术研究所（NIST）计划的核心，旨在增强对表格数据去识别技术（如合成数据）的理解。合成数据是民主化大数据利益的一项雄心勃勃的尝试；它使用生成模型重新创建敏感个人数据，以便公开发布。然而，它容易受到影响其他机器学习应用程序的偏差和隐私问题的影响，甚至可能放大这些问题。当去识别数据分布引入偏差或工件，或泄漏敏感信息时，它们会将这些问题传播到下游应用。此外，真实世界的调查条件（如多样子群、异质非有序数据空间和特征之间的复杂依赖关系）对合成数据算法提出了具体挑战。这些观察结果促使需要真实、多样和复杂的基准数据来支持隐私保护的机器学习研究，而多样社区数据摘要旨在解决这些挑战。",
