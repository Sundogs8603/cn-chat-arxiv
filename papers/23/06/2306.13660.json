    "abstract": "In this paper, our aim is to briefly survey and articulate the logical and philosophical foundations of using (first-order) logic to represent (probabilistic) knowledge in a non-technical fashion. Our motivation is three fold. First, for machine learning researchers unaware of why the research community cares about relational representations, this article can serve as a gentle introduction. Second, for logical experts who are newcomers to the learning area, such an article can help in navigating the differences between finite vs infinite, and subjective probabilities vs random-world semantics. Finally, for researchers from statistical relational learning and neuro-symbolic AI, who are usually embedded in finite worlds with subjective probabilities, appreciating what infinite domains and random-world semantics brings to the table is of utmost theoretical import.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文的目的是以非技术的方式简要概述和阐述使用（一阶）逻辑来表示（概率）知识的逻辑和哲学基础。我们的动机有三个。首先，对于机器学习研究人员，了解为什么研究社区关注关系表示的文章可以作为一个温和的介绍。其次，对于逻辑专家是新来的学习领域，这样一篇文章可以帮助导航有限与无限之间的差异，主观概率与随机世界语义。最后，对于统计关系学习和神经符号AI的研究人员，他们通常嵌入在具有主观概率的有限世界中，欣赏无限领域和随机世界语义所带来的理论价值至关重要。",
    "tldr": "本文旨在探讨使用一阶逻辑来表示知识的方式，对机器学习和逻辑专家都有指导作用，同时也对统计关系学习和神经符号AI领域有重要的理论意义。",
