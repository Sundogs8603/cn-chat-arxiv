    "translated_abstract": "解缠旨在仅从观察到的分布中恢复有意义的潜在真实因素。 可识别性为解缠提供了理论基础。 不幸的是，在自适应独立潜变量因子的情况下，在一般的非线性光滑因子到观测的映射下，无监督的可识别性在i.i.d.设置下是理论上不可能的。 在这项工作中，我们展示了非常惊人的是，在高度通用的非线性光滑映射（一个微分同胚）下，可以恢复离散化的潜在坐标，而不需要对映射进行任何额外的归纳偏差。 这是在假设潜在密度具有轴对齐的不连续标志的情况下，但不做因素的统计独立的不现实的假设。 我们引入了这种新颖的可识别性形式，称为量化坐标可识别性，并对恢复离散坐标进行了全面的证明。",
