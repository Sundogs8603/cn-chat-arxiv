    "translated_abstract": "直方图是在探索性分析中用于总结一元分布的最流行方法之一。尤其是不规则的直方图是良好的非参数密度估计量，其仅需要极少的参数：频率和带有长度的箱数。至今已经有许多方法被提出用于推断这些参数，有些采用对基础数据分布的模型假设，有些则用特定的模型选择方法。本文关注的是G-Enum直方图方法，其采用最小描述长度（MDL）法建立直方图，不需要任何用户参数，并且在准确性、简洁性和计算时间方面达到了最先进的性能表现。该方法在异常值或重尾分布情况下存在局限性，因此我们提出了一种双层启发式方法来处理这些情况。 第一层利用数据的对数变换将数据集分为数据子集列表",
