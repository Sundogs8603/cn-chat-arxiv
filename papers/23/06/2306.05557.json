    "translated_abstract": "GNN的研究强调高同质性（即相似类节点相互连接的倾向）与节点分类的强预测性能之间的关系。然而，最近的研究发现这种关系更加微妙，证明即使简单的GNN也可以在某些异质性环境中学习。为了弥合这些发现之间的差距，我们重新思考了先前作品中的假设，并确定数据集经常被视为在节点间具有恒定的同质性水平。为了更接近真实世界的数据集，我们理论上和实证地研究了GNN在测试时节点的本地同质性水平与其图的全局同质性水平偏离时的性能。为了帮助我们的理论分析，我们在同质性分析中常用的优先附加模型中引入了一个新参数，以控制生成的图中的本地同质性水平，从而实现系统的实证研究，探究本地同质性的影响。",
