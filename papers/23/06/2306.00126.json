    "translated_abstract": "MCMC的贝叶斯推断的成功与否在很大程度上取决于马尔科夫链是否能迅速达到后验分布。尽管对于贝叶斯非参数后验的推理理论颇丰，但从理想的后验目标模拟MCMC算法的收敛性质并不完全了解。本文重点研究了贝叶斯CART算法，该算法是贝叶斯添加回归树(BART)的构建块。我们推导了在各种提议分布下典型后验的混合时间的上界。利用树的小波表示，我们在信号的某些分层连接限制下提供了贝叶斯CART良好混合（多项式混合）的充分条件。我们还得出了一个负面结果，表明基于简单的生长和修剪步骤的贝叶斯CART不能在指数混合时间内快速到达深度孤立信号。为了纠正近视树的探测，我们提出了Twiggy贝叶斯CART。",
