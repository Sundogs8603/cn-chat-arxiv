    "translated_abstract": "信息检索（IR）和推荐系统（RS）任务从基于单一度量计算最终结果的排名过渡为多目标问题。解决这些问题会得到一组 Pareto-最优解，称为 Pareto frontier，其中没有目标可以进一步改善而不损害其他目标。原则上，Pareto frontier 上的所有点都有可能代表着基于两个或多个度量相结合选择的最佳模型候选者。我们提出了一种名为“从乌托邦的人口距离”（PDU）的新颖后选择策略，采用理论上的正当化技术来确定和选择 Pareto-最优解中的最佳解。具体而言，PDU 通过研究每个点与其乌托邦点（目标的理想性能）之间的距离来分析点的分布。在一定阈值范围内，通过估计 PDU 分数的点的平均位置来确定最佳解的可能位置。我们在合成和真实数据集上评估 PDU 并与其他知名的选择策略进行比较，结果表明 PDU 在准确性和稳定性方面表现优异。",
