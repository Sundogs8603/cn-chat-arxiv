    "translated_abstract": "与商品搜索引擎交互的客户越来越多地制定信息查询请求。常问问题（FAQ）检索旨在通过问题意图来检索用户查询的常见问题-答案对。将FAQ检索与商品搜索集成在一起，不仅可以使用户做出更明智的购买决策，还可以通过高效的售后支持增强用户保留率。在商品搜索中确定何时可以满足用户的信息需求的FAQ条目，而不会打扰其购物体验，是一个重要的挑战。我们提出了一个意图感知FAQ检索系统，其中包括（1）一个意图分类器，用于预测FAQ是否能够回答用户的问题；（2）一个重构模型，可以将查询重写为自然问题。离线评估表明，与基线系统相比，我们的方法在检索基准FAQ时将Hit @ 1提高了13％，同时将延迟降低了95％。这些改进结果说明了我们所提出的意图感知FAQ检索系统的有效性。",
