    "abstract": "Content Warning: This paper contains examples of misgendering and erasure that could be offensive and potentially triggering.  Gender bias in language technologies has been widely studied, but research has mostly been restricted to a binary paradigm of gender. It is essential also to consider non-binary gender identities, as excluding them can cause further harm to an already marginalized group. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate popular language models for their ability to correctly use English gender-neutral pronouns (e.g., singular they, them) and neo-pronouns (e.g., ze, xe, thon) that are used by individuals whose gender identity is not represented by binary pronouns. We introduce MISGENDERED, a framework for evaluating large language models' ability to correctly use preferred pronouns, consisting of (i) instances declaring an individual's pronoun, followed by a sentence with a missing pronoun, and (ii) an experimental setup for evaluating masked and auto-regressive languag",

    "translated_abstract": "内容警告:本文包含可能令人不悦和潜在引发情感问题的错误称呼和抹杀的例子. 性别偏见在语言技术中被广泛研究，但研究大多限于二元性别范式。考虑非二元性别身份也是至关重要的，因为排除他们可能会进一步伤害这个已经被边缘化的群体。在本文中，我们全面评估了广受欢迎的语言模型正确使用英语性别中立代词（例如单数they、them）和新代词（例如ze、xe、thon）的能力，这些代词是由那些性别认同不为二元性别所代表的个体使用。我们引入了MISGENDERED，一个用于评估大型语言模型正确使用首选代词的框架，它包括(i)陈述个体代词的实例，后面跟着一个缺少代词的句子，以及(ii)评估掩盖和自回归语言生成系统的实验设定。",
