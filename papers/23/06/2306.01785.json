    "translated_abstract": "搜索引擎结果页面（SERP）作为通往广阔互联网世界的数字门户。过去几十年以网站排名为中心的研究主要集中在这些页面上，以确定点击率（CTR）。然而，在这段时间内，SERP的景观发生了戏剧性的演变：SERP特征，包括知识面板、媒体画廊、常见问题解答等元素，已经成为这些结果页面中越来越突出的方面。我们的研究研究了这些特征的关键作用，揭示它们不仅是美学成分，而且强烈影响点击率和互联网用户的相关行为。我们展示了这些特征如何显着调节网络流量，无论是放大还是减弱它。我们使用涵盖40个不同美国电子商务领域的67,000个关键字及其相应的Google SERPs的独特数据集，分析了这些复杂的交互作用效应。",
