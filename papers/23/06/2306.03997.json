    "translated_abstract": "基于词典的金融情感分析（SA）利用人工专家创建的专门注释的词典从金融文本中提取情感。虽然基于词典的方法在文本数据上实现简单且速度快，但需要相当大的手动注释工作来创建、维护和更新词典。这些方法也被认为不如基于深度学习的方法（如Transformer模型）优越，由于它们在各种NLP任务中的出色表现，已经成为主流。然而，Transformer需要大量的数据和计算资源进行训练和测试。此外，它们涉及显著的预测时间，使其不适用于实时生产环境或处理能力受限的系统。在本文中，我们介绍了一种名为eXplainable Lexicons（XLex）的新方法，将基于词典的方法和Transformer模型的优势结合起来。",
