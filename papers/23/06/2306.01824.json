    "translated_abstract": "深度学习方法大大推进了蛋白质折叠研究领域，AlphaFold2（AF2）表现出了卓越的性能和原子级精度。由于共同演化对蛋白质结构预测至关重要，因此多序列比对（MSA）的深度会对AF2的准确性产生显著影响，而MSA需要对大量蛋白质数据库进行广泛探索以查找相似序列。然而，并非所有蛋白质序列都具有丰富的同源家族，因此在这些查询上，AF2的性能可能会降低，并且有时无法产生有意义的结果。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种新颖的生成语言模型MSA-Augmenter，它利用蛋白质特定的注意力机制和大规模MSA生成目前尚未在数据库中发现的有用的新蛋白质序列。这些序列补充了浅层MSA，增强了结构属性预测的准确性。我们在CASP14上的实验表明，MSA-Augmenter可以增强蛋白质三级结构预测的准确性。",
