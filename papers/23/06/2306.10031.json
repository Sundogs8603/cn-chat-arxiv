    "translated_abstract": "大麻是最常见的非法药品，了解其需求对分析其合法化的潜在影响至关重要。本文提出了一个内生三部分模型，考虑到偶然截尾和接触限制，以研究哥伦比亚大麻需求，并分析其合法化的潜在影响。我们的应用表明，同时建模接近度，密集度和广泛度是相关的，并且接触选择对密集度很重要。我们发现，年轻的男性，饮酒和吸烟，居住在有毒品供应商的社区，并且有吸食大麻朋友的人面临着更高的接触和使用这种药物的可能性。此外，我们发现大麻是一种无弹性的商品（-0.45弹性）。我们的结果对不同规范和定义具有鲁棒性。如果大麻合法化，对于对大麻使用风险感知中等或较低的年轻人来说会有更高的需求。",
