We use diverse source languages (English, Finnish, Hindi, Japanese, and Russian) and target languages (Bulgarian, Georgian, Kazakh, Swahili, Urdu, and Uzbek) to test the language-independence of the methods and enhance the findings' applicability. We use Character Error Rates from automatic speech recognition and predicted Mean Opinion Scores for evaluation. Results show that both phone mapping and features input improve the output quality and the latter performs better, but these effects also depend on the specific language combination. We also compare the recently-proposed Angular Similarity of Phone Frequencies (ASPF) with a family tree-based distance measure as a criterion to select source languages in transfer learning. ASPF proves effective if label-based phone input is used, while the language distance does not have expected effects.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们比较了基于PHOIBLE的音素映射方法和使用语音特征输入在低资源语言的TTS中的转移学习。我们使用多种源语言（英语，芬兰语，印地语，日语和俄语）和目标语言（保加利亚语，格鲁吉亚语，哈萨克语，斯瓦希里语，乌尔都语和乌兹别克语）测试方法的语言独立性，增强研究结果的适用性。我们使用自动语音识别的字符误差率和预测的平均意见分数进行评估。结果表明，音素映射和特征输入都可以提高输出质量，后者表现更好，但这些效果也取决于具体的语言组合。我们还将最近提出的基于角频率相似性的音频频率（ASPF）与基于家族树的距离度量进行比较，作为在转移学习中选择源语言的标准。如果使用基于标签的电话输入，则ASPF证明有效，而语言距离则没有预期的效果。",
