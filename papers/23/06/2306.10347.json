    "translated_abstract": "时间序列异常检测对于许多应用至关重要。其目标是在时间序列中识别出与正常样本分布有差异的异常样本。这个任务的最基本挑战是学习一个能够有效区分异常的表示映射。基于重建的方法仍然主导着该领域，但是使用异常数据进行表示学习可能会对性能产生负面影响。另一方面，对比学习旨在找到一种能够明显区分任何实例的表示，这可以为时间序列异常检测提供更自然和有前景的表示。在本文中，我们提出了DCdetector，一种多尺度双重关注的对比表示学习模型。DCdetector利用新颖的双重关注不对称设计创建置换环境，并使用纯对比损失来引导学习过程，从而学习一个具有优越性能的置换不变表示。",
