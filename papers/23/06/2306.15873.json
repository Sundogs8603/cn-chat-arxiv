    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新的框架，用于从数据中发现随机偏微分方程（SPDEs）。所提出的方法将随机微积分、变分贝叶斯理论和稀疏学习的概念相结合。我们提出了扩展的Kramers-Moyal展开形式，以响应状态来表示SPDE的漂移和扩散项，并使用带有稀疏学习技术的Spike-and-Slab先验来高效准确地发现潜在的SPDEs。所提出的方法已经应用于三个典型的SPDEs，分别是随机热方程、随机Allen-Cahn方程和随机Nagumo方程。我们的结果表明，所提出的方法可以准确地识别有限数据中的潜在SPDEs。这是首次尝试从数据中发现SPDEs，对于各种科学应用，如气候建模、金融预测和化学动力学，具有重要意义。",
