    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型在各种自然语言处理任务上表现出出色的性能，利用诸如预训练和指导微调等技术。尽管取得了这些进展，但它们在医疗应用中的效果受到限制，由于存在诸如事实不准确、推理能力和缺乏真实世界经验等挑战。在本研究中，我们提出了ClinicalGPT，一种专门设计和优化用于临床场景的语言模型。通过在训练过程中结合大量且多样化的真实世界数据，如医疗记录、领域特定知识和多轮对话咨询，ClinicalGPT更好地准备处理多个临床任务。此外，我们还介绍了一个综合评估框架，包括医学知识问答、医学考试、病人咨询和医疗记录的诊断分析。我们的结果表明，ClinicalGPT在大多数测试场景中表现优于现有的基线模型。",
