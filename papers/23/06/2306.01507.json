    "translated_abstract": "多租户边缘云平台中的工作负载预测对于高效的应用部署和资源配置至关重要。然而，MT-ECP中异构的应用程序模式、可变的基础架构性能以及频繁的部署给准确和高效的工作负载预测带来了重大挑战。已有的基于聚类的动态MT-ECP建模方法常常会由于需要维护大量数据集群和模型而产生过高的成本。现有的端到端时间序列预测方法在动态MT-ECP中无法提供一致的预测性能。本文提出了一种带有全局汇集和静态内容意识的端到端框架DynEformer，为动态MT-ECP提供统一的工作负载预测方案。精心设计的全局汇集和信息合并机制可以有效地识别和利用全局应用程序模式来驱动本地工作负载预测。",
