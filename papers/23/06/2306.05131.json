We develop a new federated conformal prediction method based on quantile regression and take into account privacy constraints. This method takes advantage of importance weighting to effectively address the label shift between agents and provides theoretical guarantees for both valid coverage of the prediction sets and differential privacy.

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）是一种机器学习框架，许多客户端协作训练模型，同时保持训练数据分散。尽管近年来在FL方面取得了进展，但未对不确定性量化主题（UQ）进行部分处理。在UQ方法中，合规性预测（CP）方法在最小假设下提供无分布保证。我们基于分位数回归开发了一种新的联邦合规性预测方法，并考虑了隐私约束。该方法利用重要性加权有效地解决了代理之间的标签漂移问题，并为预测集的有效覆盖和差分隐私提供了理论保证。广泛的实验证明，该方法优于目前的竞争对手。",
