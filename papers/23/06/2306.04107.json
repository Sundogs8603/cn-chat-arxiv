    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）通过迭代地聚合每个节点的局部邻域信息来表现出强大的实证性能，即消息传递。然而，具体证据显示，图神经网络可能对某些人口群体存在偏见，这要求考虑算法的公正性。尽管越来越多的努力在保证图神经网络的算法公平性，但在训练期间往往并不明确考虑消息传递在GNN中引起的偏差。本文首先研究了消息传递中的偏差放大问题。我们通过经验证据和理论证明，当来自不同人口群体的1-hop邻居不平衡时，消息传递可能会放大偏差。在这些分析的指导下，我们提出了BeMap，一种公平的消息传递方法，利用平衡感知的采样策略来平衡每个节点的1-hop邻居的数量。",
