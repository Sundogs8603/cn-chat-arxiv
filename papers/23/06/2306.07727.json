    "abstract": "Hotel bathrooms are one of the most important places in terms of customer satisfaction, and where the most complaints are reported. To share their experiences, guests rate hotels, comment, and share images of their positive or negative ratings. An important part of the room images shared by guests is related to bathrooms. Guests tend to prove their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the bathrooms with images in their comments. These Positive or negative comments and visuals potentially affect the prospective guests. In this study, two different versions of a deep learning algorithm were designed to classify hotel bathrooms as satisfactory (good) or unsatisfactory (bad, when any defects such as dirtiness, deficiencies, malfunctions were present) by analyzing images. The best-performer between the two models was determined as a result of a series of extensive experimental studies. The models were trained for each of 144 combinations of 5 hyper-parameter sets with a data set containing ",
