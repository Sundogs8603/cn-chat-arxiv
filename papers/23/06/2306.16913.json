Current AutoML systems cannot automatically adapt their own configuration to a specific use case. Further, they cannot compile user-defined application constraints on the effectiveness and efficiency of the pipeline and its generation. In this paper, we propose Caml, which uses meta-learning to automatically adapt its own AutoML parameters, such as the search strategy, the validation strategy, and the search space, for a task at hand. The dynamic AutoML strategy of Caml takes user-defined constraints into account and obtains constraint-satisfying pipelines with high predictive performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了优化特定任务的机器学习流程，需要对各种超参数进行仔细配置，通常由AutoML系统支持，该系统优化给定训练数据集的超参数。然而，根据AutoML系统的二阶元配置，AutoML过程的性能可能会有很大差异。目前的AutoML系统无法自动适应特定用例的配置。此外，它们也无法编译用户定义的应用约束，以确保流程及其生成的有效性和效率。在本文中，我们提出了Caml，它使用元学习自动适应其自身的AutoML参数，比如搜索策略、验证策略和搜索空间，以适应特定的任务。Caml的动态AutoML策略考虑用户定义的约束，并获得具有高预测性能的满足约束的流程。",
