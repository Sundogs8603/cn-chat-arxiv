    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了多目标最小权重基问题，这是经典的NP难题组合优化问题（如多目标最小生成树问题）的一个抽象。我们证明了一些非支配前沿的凸包重要性质，例如其逼近质量和极点数量的上界。利用这些性质，我们针对该问题给出了MOEA/D算法的首个运行时分析，这是一种将多目标分解为单目标组成部分并有效优化的进化算法。我们证明，在给定适当分解设置的情况下，MOEA/D能以期望的固定多项式时间在oracle模型中找到所有极点，参数是目标的数量。我们在随机的双目标最小生成树实例上进行了实验，结果与我们的理论发现一致。此外，与先前针对GSEMO问题研究的进化算法相比较，...",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm called MOEA/D that is applicable to multi-objective problems and provides a rigorous runtime analysis of MOEA/D for solving multi-objective minimum weight base problems, which proves that MOEA/D can find all extreme points in expected fixed-parameter polynomial time in the oracle model under appropriate decomposition setting. Experiments conducted on random instances verify the correctness of theoretical findings."
