    "translated_abstract": "核分解是各种图分析任务（如密集子图的发现和识别有影响力的节点）的高效构建块。其关键弱点是对图的变化非常敏感：插入或删除几条边就可能极大地改变图的核结构。因此，需要在全局和局部水平上表征、量化和，如果可能的话，提高给定图的核结构韧性。以前的研究大多考虑了整个图或其中重要子图的核韧性。本文研究了基于节点的核韧性，通过插入和删除边来度量。我们首先证明了以前提出的度量指标Core Strength不能正确地捕捉到节点在删除边的情况下的核韧性。接下来，我们引入依赖图的概念，以捕捉邻居节点（对于边删除）和可能的未来邻居节点（对于边插入）对节点核韧性的影响。基于依赖图，我们提出了一种新的基于节点的韧性度量，称为依赖核韧性。我们在各种真实网络上评估了新度量，并展示了它在捕捉节点真正核韧性方面优于Core Strength。",

The measure is evaluated on various real-world networks and shown to be superior to the previously proposed Core Strength measure."
