    "translated_abstract": "战争和冲突之后的生育变化在全球范围内得到了观察。本研究旨在研究区域战争破坏是否会影响战后生育，即使是未直接受到影响但靠近受损地区的地区。为了达到这个目的，我们利用了日本二战期间的空袭经历。利用1935年和1947年近畿地区的市町村级别生育数据以及城市空袭损失数据，我们发现轰炸对于15公里内城镇和乡村的战后生育率存在影响，尽管这些地区未直接受到损害。然而，间接影响的方向是混合的。估计结果表明，邻近城市的严重空袭增加了生育率，而较轻的空袭则降低了生育率。此外，拟实验法的结果表明，严重的空袭恐惧在战后期间增加了生育率。本研究为战后生育变化的文献提供了证据，即轰炸对于生育率有深远影响，即使是被战争损害间接影响的地区。",
