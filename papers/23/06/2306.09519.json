    "translated_abstract": "小样本知识图谱补全旨在利用少量参考实体对预测关系的未见事实。现有方法随机选择一个负采样来最小化基于边界的排名损失，但这容易导致零损失问题。此外，实体在不同的上下文中应该具有不同的表征。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的关系感知网络基于注意力损失的框架。具体而言，我们通过有策略地选择相关负样本和设计基于注意力机制的损失函数来更好地利用丰富的负样本并缓解零损失问题。直觉上，与正样本更相似的负样本将对模型贡献更大。此外，我们设计了一种动态的关系感知实体编码来捕捉不同关系下实体的不同表示。三个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，相比最先进的方法，所提出的RANA框架的有效性。",
