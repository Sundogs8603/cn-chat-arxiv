    "translated_abstract": "许多像素级的密集预测任务——如计算机视觉中的深度估计和语义分割——如今依赖于预训练的图像表示。因此，筛选有效的预训练数据集至关重要。不幸的是，有效的预训练数据集仅通过模拟环境中的带有注释的3D网格、点云和相机参数筛选而来，并不具备多视角场景。我们提出了一种不需要任何注释的数据集筛选机制。我们从开源视频数据集和合成的3D环境中挖掘了两个数据集：MIMIC-1M(包含1.3M个多视角图像对)和MIMIC-3M(包含3.1M个多视角图像对)。我们使用多个自监督模型进行训练，采用不同的遮蔽图像建模目标，展示了以下发现：在多个下游任务中，基于MIMIC-3M训练的表示优于使用注释挖掘的表示，包括深度估计、语义分割、表面法线和姿态估计等。",
