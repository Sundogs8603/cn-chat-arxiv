Attribution methods seek to shine a light on these \"black box\" models by indicating how much each input contributed to a model's outputs.

    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在精度和功能上取得了重大进展，但其内部工作仍然很大程度上未知。归因方法旨在通过指示每个输入对模型输出的贡献来揭示这些“黑匣子”模型的工作原理。集成梯度（IG）方法是一种基于公理的最先进的基线归因方法，这意味着它被设计为符合归因的特定原则。我们提出了IG的四个公理化表征，将IG确立为满足一类归因方法不同公理集的唯一方法。",
