    "abstract": "Voice digital assistants must keep up with trending search queries. We rely on a speech recognition model using contextual biasing with a rapidly updated set of entities, instead of frequent model retraining, to keep up with trends. There are several challenges with this approach: (1) the entity set must be frequently reconstructed, (2) the entity set is of limited size due to latency and accuracy trade-offs, and (3) finding the true entity distribution for biasing is complicated by ASR misrecognition. We address these challenges and define an entity set by modeling customers true requested entity distribution from ASR output in production using record deduplication, a technique from the field of entity resolution. Record deduplication resolves or deduplicates coreferences, including misrecognitions, of the same latent entity. Our method successfully retrieves 95% of misrecognized entities and when used for contextual biasing shows an estimated 5% relative word error rate reduction.",

    "translated_abstract": "语音数字助手必须跟上热门搜索查询。我们依赖于使用快速更新的实体集合进行语境偏置的语音识别模型，而不是频繁的模型重新训练，从而跟上趋势。这种方法存在若干挑战：（1）实体集必须频繁重构，（2）由于延迟和准确性权衡，实体集合的大小受限，（3）由于ASR错误识别，寻找真实实体分布是复杂的。我们通过使用实体解析领域的一种技术-记录重复消除，来解决这些挑战并定义实体集。通过建模客户从ASR输出中真实请求的实体分布，记录重复消除解决或消除了相同潜在实体的核心引用，包括错误识别。我们的方法成功检索到了95%的错误识别实体，并且在用于语境偏置时，显示出估计的5%的相对单词错误率降低。",
