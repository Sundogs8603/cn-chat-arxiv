    "abstract": "To assess the potential applications and limitations of chatbot GPT-3 Davinci-003, this study explored the temporal reliability of personality questionnaires applied to the chatbot and its personality profile. Psychological questionnaires were administered to the chatbot on two separate occasions, followed by a comparison of the responses to human normative data. The findings revealed varying levels of agreement in the chatbot's responses over time, with some scales displaying excellent while others demonstrated poor agreement. Overall, Davinci-003 displayed a socially desirable and pro-social personality profile, particularly in the domain of communion. However, the underlying basis of the chatbot's responses, whether driven by conscious self-reflection or predetermined algorithms, remains uncertain.",
