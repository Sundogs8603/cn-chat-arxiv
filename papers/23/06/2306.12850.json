    "translated_abstract": "在现代社会中，我们不断使用、利用、交互和依赖着不断高Sophistication的系统，从汽车、电子商务中的推荐系统，上网时的网络，使用我们的个人电脑和智能手机时的集成电路，保证我们的能源供应的电网，访问银行账户时的安全关键软件，到财务规划和决策时的电子表格等等。这些系统的复杂性加上我们的高度依赖意味着系统出现故障的可能性不容忽视，并且这样的故障对我们日常生活的影响可能非常大。因此，将正在出现的故障的伤害降到最低是一项关键要求，这意味着最小化系统停机时间以及系统维修成本。这就是模型诊断的作用。本文提出了基于模型诊断的高效人工智能方法来进行（交互式）调试。我们引入概率模型诊断框架，包括贝叶斯网络和马尔可夫决策过程，并且使用真实世界的例子证明了我们的方法的有效性。我们的方法可以显著减少系统维修所需的时间和成本，并能提高现代系统的整体可靠性。",
