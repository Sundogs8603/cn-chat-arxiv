    "translated_abstract": "在与多个智能体的环境中采取行动之前，自主智能体可能会从推理其他智能体和利用对系统行为的保证或信心的概念中获益。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的多智能体强化学习（MARL）算法CAMMARL，该算法涉及以置信集的形式对不同情况下其他智能体的行动进行建模，即包含其真实行动的高概率集合。然后，我们使用这些估计结果来指导智能体的决策。为了估计这些集合，我们使用了一致预测的概念，通过这种方式，我们不仅可以获得最有可能的结果的估计，还可以量化可操作的不确定性。例如，我们可以预测一个可证明以高概率（例如95％）覆盖真实预测的集合。通过在两个完全合作的多智能体任务上进行多个实验，我们展示了CAMMARL提高了智能体的能力。",
