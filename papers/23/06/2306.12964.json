    "translated_abstract": "在量化交易领域中，将原始股票历史数据转化为市场趋势指示信号是常见的实践。这些信号被称为Alpha因子。公式形式的Alpha因子更易于解释，因此风险意识强的实践者更喜欢它们。在实践中，往往同时使用一组公式化的Alpha因子进行更好的建模精度，因此我们需要找到能够良好协同的公式化Alpha集。但是，大多数传统的Alpha生成器分别挖掘单个Alpha，忽略了后续的Alpha组合重要性。本文提出了一种新的Alpha挖掘框架，它优先挖掘协同的Alpha集合，即直接使用下游组合模型的性能来优化Alpha生成器。我们的框架还利用了强化学习的强大探索能力，以更好地探索公式形式的Alpha因子的大量搜索空间。本文的贡献在于提出了使用强化学习生成协同的公式化Alpha集合的框架，优化它们作为组合模型的性能，这与传统的Alpha生成器分别挖掘单个Alpha的方法形成对比。",
