    "translated_abstract": "标签错误是注释数据中普遍存在的问题。大量的标签错误会严重降低深度学习模型的质量。现有的解决标签错误问题的方法主要集中在分类任务上，要么依赖于任务特定的架构，要么需要非常复杂的额外计算，这些都不适合工业使用。在本文中，我们提出了LEDO：一种面向模型的、计算效率高的标签错误检测和重写框架。LEDO基于 Monte Carlo Dropout 和不确定性度量，可以很容易地推广到多个任务和数据集。将LEDO应用于工业意见问答系统中，证明它能有效提高所有核心模型的准确性。具体而言，LEDO为检索模型带来1.1％的MRR增益，为机器阅读理解模型提高1.5％的PR AUC，为排名器的平均精度提高0.9％。",
