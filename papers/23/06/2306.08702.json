Since Romansh is an unseen language, we are dealing with a zero-shot setting. Using embeddings from mBERT, both models reach an alignment error rate of 0.22, which outperforms fast_align, a statistical model, and is on par with similarity-based word alignment for seen languages. We interpret these results as evidence that mBERT contains information that can be meaningful and applicable to Romansh.  To evaluate performance, we also present a new trilingual corpus, which we call the DERMIT (DE-RM-IT) corpus, containing press releases made by the Canton of Grisons in German, Romansh and Italian in the past 25 years.

    "translated_abstract": "我们在德语和罗曼什语之间的平行句子中，使用mBERT和XLM-R的词嵌入，结合基于相似性的词语对齐模型（SimAlign和awesome-align）进行测试。由于罗曼什语是一种未知语言，我们处于零样本的情况。使用mBERT的词嵌入，两个模型的对齐错误率为0.22，优于统计模型fast_align，并且与对于已知语言的基于相似性的词语对齐相当。我们将这些结果解释为mBERT包含了对罗曼什语有意义和适用的信息的证据。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过在德语和罗曼什语的平行句子中使用mBERT和XLM-R的词嵌入，结合相似性对齐模型，评估了mBERT对罗曼什语的理解能力。结果显示mBERT的词嵌入能够有效地对罗曼什语进行词语对齐，为进一步研究提供了有意义和适用的信息。"
