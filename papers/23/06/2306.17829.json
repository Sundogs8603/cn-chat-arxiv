    "translated_abstract": "联合学习（FL）作为一种保护隐私的算法已经获得了显著的关注，但是联合学习算法如联合平均（FED Avg）或联合SGD（FED SGD）与集成学习算法的相似性尚未完全探索。本文旨在研究FL在目标检测中的应用作为一种增强泛化性能的方法，并将其与集中式训练方法的目标检测算法进行性能比较。具体来说，我们研究了使用FL训练的YOLOv5模型在多个客户端上的性能，并采用无替换的随机抽样策略，使每个客户端持有一部分用于集中式训练的相同数据集。我们的实验结果展示了FL目标检测器的全局模型在生成准确的未见过目标的边界框方面的卓越效率，测试集是来自两个不同客户端的对象的混合。",
