    "translated_abstract": "在服务和工业领域中，自主机器人系统的需求比以往任何时候都要更大。在后者中，生产过程向小批量甚至“单批量”转变，这要求机器人控制系统架构可以提供所需的灵活性。这样的架构不仅必须具备足够的知识集成框架，还必须支持自主任务执行，并允许不同任务和机器人系统之间的互换性和互操作性。我们介绍了SkiROS2，这是一个基于ROS的基于技能的机器人控制平台。SkiROS2提出了一个层次化、混合控制结构，用于自动化任务规划和反应式执行，并支持用于推理世界状态和实体的知识库。调度表达式建立在扩展行为树模型之上，将任务级规划和执行合并在一起。这允许高度模块化和对环境变化的快速反应。技能f...",
