    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的研究方法，利用大型语言模型的杰出知识和推理能力，对可解释的金融时间序列预测进行了探究。使用机器学习模型进行金融时间序列预测存在诸多挑战，包括跨序列推理和推断的困难、将历史新闻、金融知识图谱等多模态信号纳入模型的难度，以及模型结果的解释和说明问题。为此，本文以纳斯达克100股票为例，利用公开可获取的历史股价数据、公司元数据以及历史经济/金融新闻进行了实验，以说明LLM在提供上述挑战的统一解决方案方面的潜力。我们的实验包括使用GPT-4进行零样本/少样本推断以及使用公共LLM模型Open LLaMA进行指令式微调等方面。实验结果表明，我们的方法优于一些基线模型。",
