    "translated_abstract": "解决逆问题，即找到产生期望输出值的输入值，是具有挑战性的。解决此类问题通常需要大量的计算，而且在高维输入空间中理解解决方案也很困难。本文针对添加制造中的问题，解决了这两个问题，旨在使逆问题的解决更加容易，并利用其结果。首先，我们着重研究了高斯过程代理，描述了通过对锥形截断的简单修改，如何显著加速代理而不失预测准确度。其次，我们展示了 Kohonen 自组织映射可以用于在高维输入空间中直观地解释逆问题的解决方案。针对我们的数据集，由于并非所有输入维度都同样重要，我们展示了使用加权距离得到更好组织映射的关系。",

The modification of tapering significantly speeds up the Gaussian process surrogate without reducing prediction accuracy.
