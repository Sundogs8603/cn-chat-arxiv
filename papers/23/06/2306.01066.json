    "abstract": "Navigation is a complex skill with a long history of research in animals and humans. In this work, we simulate the Morris Water Maze in 2D to train deep reinforcement learning agents. We perform automatic classification of navigation strategies, analyze the distribution of strategies used by artificial agents, and compare them with experimental data to show similar learning dynamics as those seen in humans and rodents. We develop environment-specific auxiliary tasks and examine factors affecting their usefulness. We suggest that the most beneficial tasks are potentially more biologically feasible for real agents to use. Lastly, we explore the development of internal representations in the activations of artificial agent neural networks. These representations resemble place cells and head-direction cells found in mouse brains, and their presence has correlation to the navigation strategies that artificial agents employ.",

    "translated_abstract": "导航是一项复杂的技能，其在动物和人类的研究历史悠久。本文通过模拟2D的莫里斯水迷宫，训练深度强化学习代理程序，自动分类导航策略，分析人工智能代理程序使用的策略分布，并与实验数据进行比较，展示了与人类和啮齿类动物相似的学习动态。同时，我们开发了特定于环境的辅助任务，并研究对其有用性的影响因素。我们认为，最具益处的任务可能更符合真实代理使用的生物学特征。最后，我们探讨了代理程序神经网络激活中内部表征的发展。这些表征类似于发现于鼠脑中的位置细胞和头方向细胞，其存在与代理程序使用的导航策略有关。",
