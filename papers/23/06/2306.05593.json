    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a localized neural network (LNN) model and then develop the LNN based estimation and inferential procedures for dependent data in both cases with quantitative/qualitative outcomes. We explore the use of identification restrictions from a nonparametric regression perspective, and establish an estimation theory for the LNN setting under a set of mild conditions. The asymptotic distributions are derived accordingly, and we show that LNN automatically eliminates the dependence of data when calculating the asymptotic variances. The finding is important, as one can easily use different types of wild bootstrap methods to obtain valid inference practically. In particular, for quantitative outcomes, the proposed LNN approach yields closed-form expressions for the estimates of some key estimators of interest. Last but not least, we examine our theoretical findings through extensive numerical studies.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种局部化神经网络（LNN）模型，并针对具有定量/定性结果的相关数据开发了LNN所基于的估计和推断程序。我们从非参数回归的角度探索了标识限制的使用，并在一组温和的条件下建立了LNN设置的估计理论。相应地导出了渐近分布，并且我们表明，LNN在计算渐近方差时自动消除了数据的依赖性。这一发现是重要的，因为人们可以轻松地使用不同类型的野蛮引导方法来获得有效的推断。特别地，对于定量结果，所提出的LNN方法为一些关键估计量的估计提供了封闭式表达式。最后，我们通过广泛的数值研究来检验我们的理论发现。",
