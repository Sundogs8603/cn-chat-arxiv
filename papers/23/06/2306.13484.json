    "translated_abstract": "集成电路验证近年来引起了相当大的关注。由于这些电路每年都在不断增长复杂性，因此Si前验证变得越来越重要，以确保其正常功能。因此，为了减少手动验证IC所需的时间，我们提出了一种机器学习（ML）方法，该方法使用较少的仿真次数。该方法依赖于一组操作条件配置（OCC），以训练高斯过程（GP）替代模型。通过使用替代模型，我们可以提出进一步更困难的OCC。对于几个迭代重复这个过程已经在合成和真实电路上表现出更好的GP估计电路响应，提高了找到某些电路响应的最坏情况甚至使之失败的机会。因此，我们展示了这种提出的方法能够为所有电路提供更接近规格的OCC，并确定一种故障。",
