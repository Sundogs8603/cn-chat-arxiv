    "translated_abstract": "组织学成像是医学诊断和研究的重要工具，能够在微观水平上检查组织结构和组成。了解组织结构的基本分子机制对揭示疾病机制和开发有效治疗方法至关重要。基因表达谱提供了深入了解组织结构背后分子过程的视角，但这一过程耗时且昂贵。在本研究中，我们提出了一种名为BLEEP（Bi-modaL Embedding for Expression Prediction）的双模式嵌入框架，能够从全幅苏木精-伊红（H&E）染色组织学图像中生成空间分辨率的基因表达谱图，并通过对比学习框架在微米分辨率下使用成对的图像和表达谱来构建低维联合嵌入空间的。通过这个框架，可用周围图像的背景上下文推断出任何查询图像补丁的基因表达，从而实现了空间分辨率的基因表达谱地图的生成。我们在四种不同组织类型上展示了BLEEP的有效性，在性能上达到了与最先进的方法竞争的水平。",
