At the same time, recent advances in few-shot learning have opened door to applications where available training data is limited. In this work, we introduce the hitherto unexplored paradigm of few-shot graph generative modeling.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度图生成建模因其直接学习潜在隐藏图分布的惊人能力而受到极大关注。尽管这些技术最初取得了成功，但像许多现有的深度生成方法一样，需要大量的训练样本才能学习一个好的模型。不幸的是，在罕见疾病的药物发现等场景中，可能不总是有足够的训练样本可用。同时，最近少样本学习的进展为训练数据有限的应用打开了大门。本文介绍了少样本图生成建模这一迄今未曾探索的范式。为此，我们开发了GSHOT，一个基于元学习的框架，用于少样本标记图生成建模。GSHOT学习从类似的辅助图数据集中转移元知识。利用这些先前的经验，GSHOT通过自适应的自我调整快速适应未见过的图数据集。",
