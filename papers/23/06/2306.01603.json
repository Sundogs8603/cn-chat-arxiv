    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）因其在共享知识的同时保护用户数据、保护隐私、提高学习效率并减少通信负载的能力而受到关注。去中心化联邦学习（DFL）是一种去中心化的网络架构，与集中式FL（CFL）相比，DFL消除了中心服务器的需求。DFL使客户端之间可以直接通信，从而显著节省了通信资源。本文对DFL进行了全面的调查和深入的展望。首先，对CFL的方法、挑战和变体进行了回顾，奠定了DFL的背景。然后，介绍了DFL的系统和详细的前景，包括迭代顺序、通信协议、网络拓扑、范例提议和时间变异性。接下来，基于DFL的定义，提出了几个扩展变体和分类并使用了最先进的技术。最后，除了总结DFL的优势与劣势，对DFL未来研究和应用前景进行了展望。",
