    "abstract": "Concept erasure aims to remove specified features from a representation. It can improve fairness (e.g. preventing a classifier from using gender or race) and interpretability (e.g. removing a concept to observe changes in model behavior). We introduce LEAst-squares Concept Erasure (LEACE), a closed-form method which provably prevents all linear classifiers from detecting a concept while changing the representation as little as possible, as measured by a broad class of norms. We apply LEACE to large language models with a novel procedure called \"concept scrubbing,\" which erases target concept information from every layer in the network. We demonstrate our method on two tasks: measuring the reliance of language models on part-of-speech information, and reducing gender bias in BERT embeddings. Code is available at https://github.com/EleutherAI/concept-erasure.",

    "translated_abstract": "概念擦除旨在从表征中删除指定的特征。它可以提高公平性（例如，防止分类器使用性别或种族）和可解释性（例如，删除概念以观察模型行为的变化）。我们引入了LEAst-squares概念擦除（LEACE），这是一种闭合形式的方法，可证明防止所有线性分类器检测到概念，同时尽可能地改变表示，如广泛类别的范数所测量的那样。我们使用名为“概念擦除”的新方法将LEACE应用于大型语言模型，擦除每个层中的目标概念信息。我们在两个任务上展示了我们的方法：测量语言模型对词性信息的依赖性，以及减少BERT嵌入中的性别偏差。代码可在https://github.com/EleutherAI/concept-erasure上找到。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a closed-form method, LEACE, which can remove specified features while changing the representation as little as possible, and prevents all linear classifiers from detecting the concept. The author applies this method to large language models using a novel procedure named \"concept scrubbing\" and achieves good performance on measuring the reliance of language models on part-of-speech information and reducing gender bias in BERT embeddings."
