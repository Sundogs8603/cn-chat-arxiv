Despite its importance, there is limited research on market making in the Chinese stock market, which is one of the largest and most rapidly growing markets globally. To address this gap, we employ an optimal market making framework with an exponential CARA-type (Constant Absolute Risk Aversion) utility function that accounts for various market conditions, such as price drift, volatility, and stamp duty, and is capable of describing 3 major risks (i.e., inventory, execution and adverse selection risks) in market making practice, and provide an in-depth quantitative and scenario analysis of market making in the Chinese stock market. Our numerical experiments explore the impact of volatility on the market maker's inventory. Furthermore, we find that the stamp duty rate is a critical factor in market making, with a ",

    "translated_abstract": "做市商在提供流动性和维护金融市场稳定方面起着至关重要的作用，是资本市场良好运行的重要组成部分。然而，中国股票市场中关于做市商的研究有限，而中国股票市场是全球最大、增长最快的市场之一。为了填补这一空白，我们采用了一个最优做市商模型，该模型考虑了价格漂移、波动率、印花税等各种市场情况，并能够描述做市商实践中的三种主要风险（即库存风险、订单风险和不利选择风险），并对中国股票市场的做市商进行了深入的定量和情景分析。我们的数值实验探讨了波动率对做市商库存的影响。此外，我们发现，印花税率是做市商的关键因素。",

The study also highlights the importance of considering volatility in market maker's inventory management."
