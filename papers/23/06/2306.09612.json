    "translated_abstract": "类不平衡是指某些类别的实例数量比其他类别少得多的现象，在真实世界的图结构场景中普遍存在。最近的研究发现，现有的图神经网络（GNNs）会低估较小类别的样本。我们调查了这种现象，并发现主类别的子空间挤压较小类别的子空间是这种失败的主要原因。我们自然地受到启发，以扩大较小类别的决策边界为目标，提出了通过综合更难的较小类别样本的通用框架GraphSHA。此外，为了避免扩大的较小边界违反邻居类别的子空间，我们还提出了一个称为SemiMixup的模块，将扩大的边界信息传递到较小类的内部，同时阻止从较小类到邻居类的信息传播。经验证明，GraphSHA在扩大较小类别的决策边界方面表现出了它的有效性。",

    "en_tdlr": "GraphSHA is a universal framework that can alleviate the problem of class imbalance. By synthesizing harder minor class samples to enlarge the decision boundaries of minor classes, and proposing the SemiMixup module to prevent the enlarged boundary from violating the subspaces of neighbor classes, it effectively addresses the under-representation of minor class samples in off-the-shelf Graph Neural Networks."
