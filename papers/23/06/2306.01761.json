    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT是预训练大语言模型家族中的一员，是一种对话人工智能。这种文本生成模型通过监督学习和强化学习进行微调，可以生成看似由自然智能撰写的文本文件。虽然这种生成模型有很多优点，但也存在一些合理的担忧。本文提出了一种基于机器学习的解决方案，可以识别出ChatGPT生成的文本与人类编写的文本，以及在分类过程中共计11种机器学习和深度学习算法的对比分析。我们在一个Kaggle数据集上测试了所提出的模型，该数据集包含10,000个文本，其中5,204个文本是人类从新闻和社交媒体上收集的写作。在由GPT-3.5生成的语料库上，所提出的算法呈现出77%的准确度。",
