    "abstract": "One straightforward metric to evaluate a survival prediction model is based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) -- the average of the absolute difference between the time predicted by the model and the true event time, over all subjects. Unfortunately, this is challenging because, in practice, the test set includes (right) censored individuals, meaning we do not know when a censored individual actually experienced the event. In this paper, we explore various metrics to estimate MAE for survival datasets that include (many) censored individuals. Moreover, we introduce a novel and effective approach for generating realistic semi-synthetic survival datasets to facilitate the evaluation of metrics. Our findings, based on the analysis of the semi-synthetic datasets, reveal that our proposed metric (MAE using pseudo-observations) is able to rank models accurately based on their performance, and often closely matches the true MAE -- in particular, is better than several alternative methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "评估生存预测模型的一种直接指标是基于平均绝对误差（MAE）-模型预测时间与真实事件时间之间的绝对差值的平均值，对所有个体进行。然而，这是具有挑战性的，因为在实践中，测试集包括（正确）被审查的个体，这意味着我们不知道被审查个体实际经历事件的时间。在本文中，我们探索了用于评估包括（许多）被审查个体的生存数据集的各种指标来估计MAE。此外，我们介绍了一种新颖而有效的方法来生成逼真的半合成生存数据集，以便评估指标。基于半合成数据集的分析，我们的发现表明，我们提出的指标（使用伪观察法的MAE）能够准确地排名模型的性能，并且通常与真实的MAE非常接近-特别是优于几种替代方法。",
