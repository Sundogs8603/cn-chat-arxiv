    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）如ChatGPT和GPT4正在自然语言处理和人工智能领域掀起新的热潮，由于它们的突现能力和一般化能力。然而，LLM是黑盒模型，往往不能捕捉和获取实际知识。相比之下，知识图谱（KGs）如维基百科和华普则是明确存储丰富实际知识的结构化知识模型。KGs可以通过为推理和可解释性提供外部知识来增强LLMs。同时，KGs的构建困难，自然而然地演化，这挑战了现有的KGs方法来生成新事实并表示未见过的知识。因此，统一LLMs和KGs并同时利用它们的优点是有益的。本文介绍了一个前瞻性的统一LLMs和KGs的路线图。我们的路线图包括三个一般框架，即1）增强KGs的LLMs，它们将知识表示为LM的一部分，从而能够捕捉丰富的实体关系，2）知识增强KGs，它们将LLMs用作知识表示学习的优秀工具，3）LLMs与KGs的联合推理，其中LLMs和KGs相互增强，从而获得更准确的推理模型。",
