    "abstract": "A new class of tools, colloquially called generative AI, can produce high-quality artistic media for visual arts, concept art, music, fiction, literature, video, and animation. The generative capabilities of these tools are likely to fundamentally alter the creative processes by which creators formulate ideas and put them into production. As creativity is reimagined, so too may be many sectors of society. Understanding the impact of generative AI and making policy decisions around it - requires new interdisciplinary scientific inquiry into culture, economics, law, algorithms, and the interaction of technology and creativity. We argue that generative AI is not the harbinger of art's demise, but rather is a new medium with its own distinct affordances. In this vein, we consider the impacts of this new medium on creators across four themes: aesthetics and culture, legal questions of ownership and credit, the future of creative work, and impacts on the contemporary media ecosystem.

    "translated_abstract": "一类新工具被俗称为生成AI，可以为视觉艺术、概念艺术、音乐、小说、文学、视频和动画创造高质量的艺术媒介。这些工具的生成能力可能会从根本上改变创造者制定想法并将其投入生产的创造过程。随着创造力的重新构想，社会的许多领域也可能被重新构想。理解生成AI的影响并制定政策决策 - 需要新的跨学科的科学探究文化、经济、法律、算法以及技术和创造力的交互。我们认为，生成AI并不是艺术灭亡的先兆，而是一种具有自己独特优势的新媒介。在这方面，我们考虑了这种新媒介对四个主题中的创作者的影响：美学和文化，所有权和信用的法律问题，创造性工作的未来以及对当代媒体生态系统的影响。在这些主题中，我们强调了生成AI中艺术和科学的交叉对创造力和社会的转化潜力。",
