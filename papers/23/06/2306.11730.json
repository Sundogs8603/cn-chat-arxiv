Our results indicate that SAM's 'segment anything' mode can achieve clinically acceptable segmentation results in most organs-at-risk (OARs) with Dice scores higher than 0.7. SAM's 'box prompt' mode further improves the Dice scores by 0.1 to 0.5. Considering the size of the organ and the clarity of its boundary, SAM displays better performance for large organs with clear boundaries but performs worse for smaller organs with unclear boundaries. Given that SAM, a model pre-trained purely on natural images, can handle the delineation of OARs from medical images with clinically acceptable accuracy, these results highlight SAM's robust generalization capabilities with consistent accuracy in automatic segmentation for radiotherapy. In other words, SAM can achieve delineation of different OARs at different sites using a generic automatic segmentation model. SAM's generalization capabilitie",
