The idea is to apply the one-sided HP (OHP) filter recursively on the updated cyclical component to extract the trend residual on multiple time scales, thereby to improve the trend estimate. To address the issue of optimization with a moving horizon as that of the SOHP filter, we present an incremental HP filtering algorithm, which greatly simplifies the involved inverse matrix operation and reduces the computational demand of the basic HP filtering.

Numerical examples on real economic data show the better performance of the SOHP filter in comparison with other known HP-type filters.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文从多时间尺度分解的角度提出了连续单侧Hodrick-Prescott（SOHP）滤波器，旨在为时序数据提供趋势估计。其核心思想是在更新的周期性成分上递归应用单侧HP（OHP）滤波器，从而在多个时间尺度上提取趋势残差，从而改进趋势估计。为了解决SOHP滤波器存在的移动视窗优化问题，我们提出了一种增量式HP滤波算法，极大地简化了所涉及的逆矩阵运算，并降低了基本HP滤波器的计算需求。实际上，这种新算法也适用于其他HP类型的滤波器，尤其是在大型或扩张数据情境下表现更佳。对真实经济数据的数值实验显示，与其他众所周知的HP类型滤波器相比，SOHP滤波器表现更佳。",
