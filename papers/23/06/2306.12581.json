    "abstract": "Recent years have brought great advances into solving morphological tasks, mostly due to powerful neural models applied to various tasks as (re)inflection and analysis. Yet, such morphological tasks cannot be considered solved, especially when little training data is available or when generalizing to previously unseen lemmas. This work explores effects on performance obtained through various ways in which morphological models get access to subcharacter phonological features that are the targets of morphological processes. We design two methods to achieve this goal: one that leaves models as is but manipulates the data to include features instead of characters, and another that manipulates models to take phonological features into account when building representations for phonemes. We elicit phonemic data from standard graphemic data using language-specific grammars for languages with shallow grapheme-to-phoneme mapping, and we experiment with two reinflection models over eight language",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，强大的神经模型在各种任务（重新）变形和分析方面得到了广泛应用，从而在解决形态学任务方面取得了巨大进展。然而，尤其是当可用的训练数据很少或推广到之前未见的词条时，这些形态学任务不能被认为是解决了。这项工作探讨了形态模型获得目标形态学过程的次要语音特征的各种方式对性能的影响。我们设计了两种方法来实现这个目标：一种方法是将模型保留为旧模型但操作数据以包含特征而不是字符，另一种方法是操作模型以在构建音素表示时考虑音韵特征。我们使用具有浅表字形到音素映射的语言的语言特定语法从标准字形数据收集音素数据，并对八种语言对上的两个变形模型进行实验，几乎每个案例都获得了改进。我们还表明，选择要包括的音韵特征以及它们的操作方式对性能产生深远影响，而在语言学中通常不考虑的音韵属性对变形有益。",
