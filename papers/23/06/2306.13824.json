    "translated_abstract": "在许多差分隐私的实际应用中，从业者试图在目标精度水平下提供最佳的隐私保证。最近，一系列通过利用“噪声减少”思想将相关噪声加到私有计算的充分统计中并生成一系列越来越准确答案的“精度优先”机制已被开发出来。噪声减少机制的一个主要优点是分析人员仅需支付发布的最不嘈杂或最准确答案的隐私成本。虽然这种单独的吸引力属性，但没有系统地研究如何将它们与其他差分隐私机制结合使用。一个基本的挑战是噪声减少机制的隐私保证被（必然地）制定为“事后隐私”，其以发布的结果为函数边界隐私损失。此外，至今仍缺乏一种将噪声减少机制与“事前隐私”机制（例如随机响应或拉普拉斯机制）进行组合的原则方法，这些机制直接作为输入大小或查询工作量的隐私损失边界。本文通过提出一种新的框架，介绍了用于自适应隐私组合的噪声减少机制和事前隐私机制，以同时实现高精度和隐私。我们在一系列真实世界的数据集和查询上证明了我们方法的有效性。",
