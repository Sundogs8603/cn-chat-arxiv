    "translated_abstract": "在许多地区，图像匿名化是为了遵守隐私法规而广泛采用的方法。然而，匿名化通常会降低数据的质量，从而降低计算机视觉开发的效用。本文研究了图像匿名化对训练计算机视觉模型在关键计算机视觉任务（检测、实例分割和姿态估计）上的影响。具体而言，我们在常见的检测数据集上评估了传统和逼真匿名化对识别能力的影响，其中包括面部和全身。我们全面的实验结果表明，传统图像匿名化对最终模型性能产生了实质性的影响，特别是当对全身进行匿名化时。此外，我们发现逼真匿名化可以缓解这种性能下降，当面部进行匿名化时，我们的实验结果表明仅有微小的性能下降。我们的研究表明，逼真匿名化可以实现隐私保护的计算机视觉训练。",
