    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种通过高效关系旋转（TransERR）实现的基于翻译的知识图嵌入方法，这是传统基于翻译的知识图嵌入模型的一种简单且有效的替代方案。与先前的基于翻译模型不同，TransERR在超复值空间中对知识图进行编码，从而使其能够在挖掘头部和尾部实体之间的潜在信息时具有更高程度的翻译自由度。为进一步减小翻译距离，TransERR通过它们各自可学习的单位四元数适应性地旋转头实体和尾实体。我们还提供数学证明来展示TransERR在建模各种关系模式（包括对称性、反对称性、倒置、合成和子关系模式）方面的能力。对10个基准数据集的实验验证了其有效性。",
