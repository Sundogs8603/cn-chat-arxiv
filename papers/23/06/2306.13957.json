    "translated_abstract": "深度生成模型的进展为带有所需性质的de novo分子生成提供了启示。然而，针对双重蛋白质靶点的分子生成仍面临着巨大的挑战，包括蛋白质3D结构数据的获取，自回归采样以及模型对未见过目标的泛化能力。我们提出了基于扩散模型的DiffDTM，这是一种新颖的无条件结构免深度生成模型，用于双重靶点分子生成，以解决上述问题。具体而言，DiffDTM接收蛋白质序列和分子图作为输入，而非蛋白质和分子构象，并引入信息融合模块以实现一次性有条件生成。我们进行了全面的多视图实验，证明了DiffDTM能够生成针对特定双重蛋白质的药物样，可合成，新颖且具有高结合亲和力的分子，并优于最先进技术（SOTA）。",
