    "translated_abstract": "研究人员不断利用新形式的数据，旨在了解人们如何认知建筑环境并建立城市的集体地方认同。生成式人工智能（AI）模型的最新进展使得可以从大量数据中学习并生成逼真的表现形式。本研究旨在测试生成式AI作为文本和视觉信息来源的潜力，以捕捉经过过滤的城市地方认同。我们向ChatGPT和DALL-E2两个生成式AI模型提出关于31个全球城市地方认同的问题。由于生成式AI引发了其可靠性的伦理问题，我们进行了交叉验证以检查结果是否显示出与真实城市环境相似的模式。",
    "tldr": "本研究测试了生成式人工智能在捕捉城市地方认同方面的潜力，结果表明它可以生成多样化的逼真表现，但不能过度依赖，同时挖掘了它的潜力和局限性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study tested the potential of generative artificial intelligence in capturing the place identity of cities and found it was able to generate diverse and realistic representations, while highlighting the need for caution in relying solely on such models and the limitations and ethical concerns associated with their use."
