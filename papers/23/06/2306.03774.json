    "abstract": "This paper presents the first comprehensive study on automatic readability assessment of Turkish texts. We combine state-of-the-art neural network models with linguistic features at lexical, morphosyntactic, syntactic and discourse levels to develop an advanced readability tool. We evaluate the effectiveness of traditional readability formulas compared to modern automated methods and identify key linguistic features that determine the readability of Turkish texts.",
