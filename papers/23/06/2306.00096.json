    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑线性Bandit情况下的Pareto前沿识别（PFILin），其目标是在平均奖励向量作为环境的线性函数的情况下，识别一组奖励向量不被其他任何向量所占优。PFILin包括最佳动作识别和多目标主动学习等特殊情况。我们提出的算法的样本复杂度为$\\tilde{O}(d/\\Delta^2)$，其中$d$是上下文的维数，$\\Delta$是问题复杂性的一种度量。我们的样本复杂度在对数因子上是最优的。本算法的一个新特点是使用所有动作的上下文信息。除了有效地识别Pareto前沿之外，我们的算法还保证，在样本数大于$\\Omega(d\\log dL)$时，对于$L$维矢量奖励，瞬时Pareto遗憾的$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{d/t})$界限。通过使用所有动作的上下文信息，我们提出的算法同时为线性Bandit提供了有效的Pareto前沿识别和Pareto遗憾最小化。",
