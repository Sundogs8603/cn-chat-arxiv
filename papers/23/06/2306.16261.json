    "abstract": "Personalization in Information Retrieval is a topic studied for a long time. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of high-quality, real-world datasets to conduct large-scale experiments and evaluate models for personalized search. This paper contributes to filling this gap by introducing SE-PQA (StackExchange - Personalized Question Answering), a new curated resource to design and evaluate personalized models related to the task of community Question Answering (cQA). The contributed dataset includes more than 1 million queries and 2 million answers, annotated with a rich set of features modeling the social interactions among the users of a popular cQA platform. We describe the characteristics of SE-PQA and detail the features associated with questions and answers. We also provide reproducible baseline methods for the cQA task based on the resource, including deep learning models and personalization approaches. The results of the preliminary experiments conducted show the appropriateness",

    "translated_abstract": "个人化的信息检索一直是一个长期研究的课题。然而，目前仍然缺乏高质量、真实的数据集来开展大规模实验，并评估个性化搜索模型。本文通过引入SE-PQA (StackExchange - 个性化问题回答)来填补这一空白，这是一个新的精选资源，用于设计和评估与社区问题回答任务相关的个性化模型。贡献的数据集包括超过1百万个查询和2百万个回答，使用了一系列丰富的特征来模拟一个流行社区问题回答平台的用户之间的社交互动。我们描述了SE-PQA的特点，并详细说明了与问题和回答相关的特征。我们还提供了基于该资源的社区问题回答任务的可复现基线方法，包括深度学习模型和个性化方法。初步实验结果表明了其合适性。",
