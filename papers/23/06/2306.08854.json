    "translated_abstract": "图缩减是一种通过处理原图的较小版本来解决大规模图问题的技术，并可能将结果插值回原图。它在科学计算领域有着悠久的历史，最近在机器学习领域变得越来越流行，特别是在保持图谱的方法中。本文从不同的角度研究了图缩减，发展了一种保持图距离的理论并提出了一种可行的方法。这种几何方法在处理图集合时非常有用，例如在图分类和回归中。在本研究中，我们将图看作是装备有Gromov-Wasserstein（GW）距离的度量空间上的一个元素，并且限定了两个图和它们缩减版本之间的距离差异。使用流行的加权核$ K $ -means方法可以最小化此差异，利用GW距离可以提高现有的保谱方法。",
