We define the ESG price process and integrate it into an extension of Bachelier's market model in both discrete and continuous time, enabling option pricing valuation.",

    "translated_abstract": "环境、社会和治理（ESG）金融是现代金融和投资的基石，通过将投资表现的另一维度——投资的ESG得分纳入经典的回报风险投资观念中，改变了投资的观念。我们定义了ESG价格过程，并将其集成到巴舍利尔市场模型的离散和连续时间的扩展中，实现了期权定价的估值。",
    "tldr": "本论文的创新点在于提出了一种基于巴舍利尔市场模型的ESG资产定价模型，并且将其应用于期权定价估值中。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a Bachelier market model-based ESG asset pricing model, and applies it to option pricing valuation, which is an innovation compared to classical return-risk investment view by incorporating ESG score into investment performance."
