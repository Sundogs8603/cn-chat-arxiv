    "translated_abstract": "近来，生成式扩散模型(GDMs)在学习和生成图像方面展示了其卓越的能力。大量的GDMs社区自然而然地出现，并促进了GDMs在各个领域的多样化应用。然而，这种无限制的扩散引起了有关版权保护的严重关注。例如，艺术家(包括画家和摄影师)越来越担心GDMs可以毫不费力地复制他们独特的创意作品而无需授权。为了应对这些挑战，我们介绍了一种针对GDMs量身定制的新型水印方案——DiffusionShield。通过将所有权信息编码成一个不可察觉的水印并将其注入图像中，DiffusionShield保护图像免受GDMs侵权。它的水印可以被GDMs轻松地学习并重现在它们生成的图像中。通过从生成的图像中检测水印，可以揭露版权侵权行为。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种针对生成式扩散模型的版权保护数字水印方法DiffusionShield，保护图像免受侵权，简单易学，难以检测，可广泛应用于各行各业。",
