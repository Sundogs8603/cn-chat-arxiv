    "translated_abstract": "安全受限机组组合优化（SCUC）是电力系统日前调度和市场清算中所需的一个计算复杂的过程。该过程需要每日运行，并需要先进的算法来加快这个过程。与SCUC相关的约束和数据都具有地理和时间相关性，以确保解决方案的可靠性，这进一步增加了其复杂性。本文利用先进的机器学习模型来研究电力系统历史数据中的模式，从而囊括约束条件中的时空相关模式。时空相关机器学习模型通过采用图神经网络（GNN）来理解空间相关性，而使用长短时记忆（LSTM）网络来研究时间序列。本文提出的方法在多个测试系统（如IEEE 24-Bus系统、IEEE 73-Bus系统、IEEE 118-Bus系统和SC 500-Bus系统）上进行了验证，同时与现有方法进行了比较，其解决方案的质量和计算时间均证明其有效性。",
