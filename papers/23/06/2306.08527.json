    "abstract": "The goal of this study is to implement diffusion models for speech enhancement (SE). The first step is to emphasize the theoretical foundation of variance-preserving (VP)-based interpolation diffusion under continuous conditions. Subsequently, we present a more concise framework that encapsulates both the VP- and variance-exploding (VE)-based interpolation diffusion methods. We demonstrate that these two methods are special cases of the proposed framework. Additionally, we provide a practical example of VP-based interpolation diffusion for the SE task. To improve performance and ease model training, we analyze the common difficulties encountered in diffusion models and suggest amenable hyper-parameters. Finally, we evaluate our model against several methods using a public benchmark to showcase the effectiveness of our approach",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究的目标是实现语音增强的扩散模型。首先强调了连续条件下以方差保持为基础的插值扩散的理论基础。随后，我们提出了一个更简洁的框架，将以方差保持和以方差爆炸为基础的插值扩散方法结合在一起。我们证明这两种方法是所提出框架的特殊情况。此外，我们提供了一个以方差保持为基础的插值扩散在语音增强任务中的实际示例。为了提高性能和模型训练的便利性，我们分析了扩散模型中常见的困难，并提出可调节的超参数。最后，我们使用公共基准进行了几种方法的模型评估，展示了我们方法的有效性。",
