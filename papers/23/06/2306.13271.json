    "translated_abstract": "目前，已经提出了各种基于观察数据的因果效应估计的神经方法，其中一个默认假设是在训练和推理（即运行时）阶段变量的相同分布和可用性。然而，在运行时可能会发生分布偏移（即域偏移），而变量难以访问带来的挑战更大。这通常是由于不断增加的隐私和伦理问题造成的，这可能使得整个运行时数据中的任意变量不可用且无法填补。我们称域转移和不可访问变量的共同发生为运行时域失真，这严重影响了训练后反事实预测器的泛化能力。为了对抗运行时域失真，我们将反事实预测子纳入域自适应的概念。具体而言，我们通过源域误差和域间差异之和来上限目标域（即运行时协变量）的误差。我们将反事实预测表述为一个函数空间搜索问题。为此，我们提出了一种称为带有域失真的变分反事实预测子的新方法（V-CPDC），该方法直接优化上界，并旨在在源域和目标域中都具有良好的泛化能力。对四个实际数据集的广泛实验表明了我们方法的有效性，特别是在各种运行时域失真情况下。",
