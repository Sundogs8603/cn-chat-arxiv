    "abstract": "Many existing speech translation benchmarks focus on native-English speech in high-quality recording conditions, which often do not match the conditions in real-life use-cases. In this paper, we describe our speech translation system for the multilingual track of IWSLT 2023, which focuses on the translation of scientific conference talks. The test condition features accented input speech and terminology-dense contents. The tasks requires translation into 10 languages of varying amounts of resources. In absence of training data from the target domain, we use a retrieval-based approach (kNN-MT) for effective adaptation (+0.8 BLEU for speech translation). We also use adapters to easily integrate incremental training data from data augmentation, and show that it matches the performance of re-training. We observe that cascaded systems are more easily adaptable towards specific target domains, due to their separate modules. Our cascaded speech system substantially outperforms its end-to-end ",

    "translated_abstract": "许多现有的语音翻译基准测试都针对高品质录音条件下的以英语为母语的语音，这通常与实际使用情况中的条件不符。在本文中，我们描述了我们为IWSLT 2023多语言轨道设计的语音翻译系统，重点翻译科学会议演讲。测试条件包括口音重的输入语音和术语密集的内容，并且需要翻译成10种资源数量不同的语言。在没有来自目标领域的训练数据的情况下，我们使用了检索式方法（kNN-MT）进行有效的适应（语音翻译+0.8 BLEU）。我们还使用适配器轻松集成来自数据增强的增量训练数据，并展示其与重新训练的性能相匹配。我们观察到，级联系统更容易适应特定目标领域，因为它们是由多个独立模块组成的。我们的级联语音系统远远优于其端到端系统。",
