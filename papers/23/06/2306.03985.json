    "translated_abstract": "股票交易是财务管理的一种流行方式。然而，市场和经济环境不稳定，通常不能预测。此外，从事股票交易需要时间和精力来分析、制定策略和做出决策。如果一个机器代理能够辅助甚至执行分析和建模过去数据，然后生成自主交易策略，那将是方便和有效的。近年来，强化学习已被证明在涉及基于时间序列数据的决策制定策略达到目标的各种任务中具有鲁棒性。在本项目中，我们开发了一个模拟股票交易环境的管道，并使用深度强化学习方法，包括深度Q学习、深度SARSA和策略梯度方法，训练了一个机器代理来自动化股票交易过程。我们在相对良好（2021年之前）和恶劣（2021年-2022年）情况下评估了我们的平台。",
