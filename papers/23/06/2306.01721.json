    "translated_abstract": "语义分割一直以来都是学习更具有区分性的图像表示用于对每个像素进行分类。尽管取得了显著的进展，但分割掩模本身的先验，例如几何约束和语义约束仍未被深入探索。在本文中，我们提出了一种利用最近开发的去噪扩散生成模型建模的mask先验，改善现有区分性方法的语义分割质量。我们从为mask先验建模调整扩散模型的统一架构开始，将本文重点放在具有离散扩散的具体实例上，并确定其成功应用的各种关键设计选择。我们的初步分析揭示了几个重要发现，包括：（1）简单地将扩散模型集成到语义分割中不足以达到最佳效果，设计不良的扩散过程可能导致分割性能下降;（2）在扩散过程中，在保留遮罩结构和合并输入图像中的其他信息之间取得平衡至关重要;（3）所提出的方法可以在几个基准数据集上实现最先进的性能，而调整的超参数较少。",
