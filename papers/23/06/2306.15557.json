    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新颖的数据驱动框架，用于算法补偿，提供给用户改变其预测结果的干预措施。现有的计算补偿方法找到满足某些期望的点集，例如在基础因果图中的干预，或者最小化代价函数。然而，满足这些标准需要对基础模型结构有广泛的了解，在几个领域中往往需要大量的不切实际的信息。我们提出了一种数据驱动的、计算高效的算法补偿方法，通过在数据流形中提供用户可以采取的方向来改变其预测结果。我们提出了一种公理化合理化的方法，Stepwise Explainable Paths (StEP)，用于计算基于方向的算法补偿。我们对StEP进行了彻底的实证和理论研究。StEP提供了可证明的隐私和鲁棒性保证，并在几个已建立的补偿方法中表现优于现有技术。",
