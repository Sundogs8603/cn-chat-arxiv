This paper focuses on promotions with response-dependent costs, where expenses are incurred only when a purchase is made. Such promotions include discounts and coupons. While existing uplift model approaches aim to address this challenge, these approaches often necessitate training multiple models, like meta-learners, or encounter complications when estimating profit due to zero-inflated values stemming from non-converted individuals with zero cost and profit.  To address these challenges, we introduce Incremental Profit per Conversion (IPC), a novel uplift measure of promotional campaigns' efficiency in unit economics. Through a proposed response transformation, we demonstrate that IPC requires only converted data, its propensity, and a single model to be estimated.

    "translated_abstract": "促销在电子商务平台中发挥着关键作用，采用各种成本结构来推动用户参与。本文专注于具有响应相关成本的促销，只有当购买发生时才会产生费用。这些促销包括折扣和优惠券。虽然现有的增值模型方法旨在解决这一挑战，但这些方法通常需要训练多个模型，如元学习器，或者由于非转换个体的零成本和利润引起的零膨胀值而估算利润时遇到复杂情况。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了增量转化收益（IPC），这是一种新的促销活动单位经济效率的增值度量。通过提出的响应转化方法，我们证明IPC仅需要转换后的数据、其倾向性和一个要估计的模型即可。结果，IPC解决了上述问题，同时减轻了通常与响应相关成本有关的噪声。对模拟数据和真实世界数据集的实证研究表明，IPC提供了对促销活动获利能力更准确、更稳定的估计，是提高电子商务平台促销定向的实用工具。",

IPC addresses the challenges of response-dependent costs and provides a more accurate and stable estimate of campaign profitability by using a proposed response transformation that requires only converted data, its propensity, and a single model to be estimated. Empirical studies demonstrate IPC's practicality in improving promotion targeting in e-commerce platforms."
