    "abstract": "Time series forecasting using historical data has been an interesting and challenging topic, especially when the data is corrupted by missing values. In many industrial problem, it is important to learn the inference function between the auxiliary observations and target variables as it provides additional knowledge when the data is not fully observed. We develop an end-to-end time series model that aims to learn the such inference relation and make a multiple-step ahead forecast. Our framework trains jointly two neural networks, one to learn the feature-wise correlations and the other for the modeling of temporal behaviors. Our model is capable of simultaneously imputing the missing entries and making a multiple-step ahead prediction. The experiments show good overall performance of our framework over existing methods in both imputation and forecasting tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "使用历史数据进行时间序列预测一直是一个有趣且具有挑战性的课题，尤其是当数据被缺失值损坏时。在许多工业问题中，学习辅助观测和目标变量之间的推理函数非常重要，因为当数据未完全观测到时，它提供了额外的知识。我们开发了一个端到端的时间序列模型，旨在学习这种推理关系并进行多步预测。我们的框架同时训练两个神经网络，一个用于学习特征相关性，另一个用于建模时间行为。我们的模型能够同时插补缺失条目并进行多步预测。实验表明，我们的框架在插补和预测任务的整体表现都很好，优于现有方法。",
