    "translated_abstract": "基于评论的推荐系统（RBRS）由于能够缓解众所周知的冷启动问题而受到越来越多的研究关注。RBRS利用评论来构建用户和物品的表示。然而，在本文中，我们认为这种对评论的依赖可能会使系统面临被操纵的风险。为了探索这种可能性，在本文中，我们提出了一种用于对RBRS进行操纵攻击的基于生成的模型。具体而言，我们通过强化学习来学习一个虚假评论生成器，它通过向系统添加生成的评论导致预测偏移从而恶意推广物品。通过引入辅助奖励，借助预训练的语言模型和方面预测器来增加文本的流畅性和多样性，生成的评论可以有效地用于高保真度的操纵。实验结果表明，所提出的框架可以成功地攻击亚马逊上的三种不同类型的RBRS。",
