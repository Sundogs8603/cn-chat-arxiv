First, we introduce a phrasing structure encoder that utilizes a context representation from the pre-trained language model. In the phrasing structure encoder, we extract a speaker-dependent syntactic representation from the context representation and then predict a pause sequence that separates the input text into phrases.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管文本到语音（TTS）系统已经有了显著的进步，但大多数TTS系统仍然在合成具有适当短语结构的语音方面存在限制。为了进行自然语音合成，合成的语音需要以短语结构方式合成，该短语结构基于语义信息将单词分组。在本文中，我们提出了一种使用预训练语言模型和基于停顿的韵律建模的语音合成系统，名为 PauseSpeech。首先，我们引入一种基于短语结构的编码器，该编码器利用预训练语言模型的上下文表示。在短语结构编码器中，我们从上下文表示中提取了一个与说话者相关的句法表示，然后预测了一个停顿序列，将输入文本分成短语。此外，我们还引入了基于停顿的单词编码器，以根据停顿序列对单词级韵律进行建模。实验结果表明，PauseSpeech在自然性方面优于以前的模型。此外，在客观评估指标（例如MOS和WER）方面，我们提出的系统还与基线系统相比取得了更好的性能。",
