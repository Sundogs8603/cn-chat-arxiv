    "abstract": "This study investigates the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI ChatGPT, in medical imaging. With the aid of public data, these models, which possess remarkable language understanding and generation capabilities, are augmenting the interpretive skills of radiologists, enhancing patient-physician communication, and streamlining clinical workflows. The paper introduces an analytic framework for presenting the complex interactions between LLMs and the broader ecosystem of medical imaging stakeholders, including businesses, insurance entities, governments, research institutions, and hospitals (nicknamed BIGR-H). Through detailed analyses, illustrative use cases, and discussions on the broader implications and future directions, this perspective seeks to raise discussion in strategic planning and decision-making in the era of AI-enabled healthcare.",
