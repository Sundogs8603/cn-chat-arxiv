    "translated_abstract": "在低碳社会，为了平衡风能和太阳能等间歇性发电，需要存储大量电力，比如通过调频来实现。本文解决了储能操作员的决策问题，他们向电网操作员出售调频电力并在日前市场上交易电力。数学上，本文将未来的频偏轨迹视为反复出现的优化问题中的函数不确定性。我们约束期望的终端电量为某个目标值，以使储能操作员不仅为现在而为未来做出好的决策。由于这个约束，日前市场上交易的电力量是出售给电网操作员的调频电量的一个隐含函数。这个隐含函数量化了提供调频所导致的预期能量损失所需购买的电量。",
    "tldr": "本文解决了储能操作员如何在提供调频同时更好地交易电力的问题。通过将储能约束在目标电量，本文提出了日前市场交易电量作为调频电量的隐含函数，量化了能源损失所需购买的电量。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper solves the problem of how storage operators can better trade electricity while providing regulation power, by constraining the expected terminal state-of-charge to a target and deriving an implicit function for the amount of electricity traded on day-ahead markets. The implicit function quantifies the amount of power that needs to be purchased to cover the expected energy loss that results from providing frequency regulation."
