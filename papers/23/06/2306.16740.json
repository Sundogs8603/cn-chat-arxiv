    "translated_abstract": "在人类居住环境中导航是部署机器人广泛应用的主要挑战，通常被称为社交机器人导航。虽然社交导航领域近年来取得了很大进展，但评估解决社交导航的算法仍然困难，因为它不仅涉及机器人在静态环境中移动，还涉及到动态的人类参与者及其对机器人行为的感知适应性。相比之下，清晰、可重复、易于获得的基准在计算机视觉、自然语言处理和传统机器人导航等领域加速了进展，使研究人员能够公平比较算法，揭示现有解决方案的局限性，并呈现有前途的新方向。我们相信相同的方法可以有助于社交导航。在本文中，我们为评估社交机器人导航建立了共同、广泛可用且可重复的基准标准，并提出了自己的创新点。",
