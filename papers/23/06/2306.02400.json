    "translated_abstract": "许多实际应用需要从受损或缺失数据中重建时间信号。经典的例子包括解码、跟踪、信号增强和去噪。由于最终重建信号是由人类观看的，因此希望实现令人愉悦的重建效果。在数学上，通过恢复信号分布与自然信号的分布相同来实现完美感知质量，这是静态估计设置（即一次处理整个信号）中已经进行了大量研究的要求。在这里，我们研究了在完美感知质量约束条件下的最优因果滤波问题，这是一种根本不同的任务。具体而言，我们分析了通过线性噪声变换观察的高斯马尔可夫信号。在没有感知约束的情况下，卡尔曼滤波器被认为是该设置中MSE范围内的最优估计器。在这里，我们展示了加入完美感知质量约束会产生一种新的估计器，称为感知卡尔曼滤波器（PKF），它是在此约束条件下的最优估计器。此外，我们提供了其在线实现的实际算法，从而实现了实时操作。实验表明，与传统方法相比，PKF可以显著提高估计信号的感知质量。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the problem of online state estimation under a perfect perceptual-quality constraint for temporal signals reconstruction. It proposes a new estimator named Perceptual Kalman Filter (PKF), which is optimal subject to this constraint. Practical algorithms for online implementation are provided and experiments demonstrate that PKF can significantly improve the perceptual quality of estimated signals compared to traditional methods."
