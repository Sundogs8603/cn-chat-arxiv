    "translated_abstract": "复杂适应性学习是智能的，并在生命和非生命复杂系统中发挥作用。一个复杂系统由许多相互作用的个体或单元组成，它们在相互作用中显示出隐藏的模式，并广泛出现在几乎所有学科中，从自然科学到社会科学。这激发了科学家们探索复杂系统形成机制的兴趣。然而，这是非常具有挑战性的。本文从交易量-价格概率波动方程中提取了复杂系统中的互动一致性的普遍规律或法则，并将其应用于复杂量子系统。它假设粒子可以在加强坐标中具有复杂适应性学习或智能样性质，并将金融市场交易者的复杂适应性学习延伸到量子物理中的非生命粒子。在这些假设的基础上，作者提出了一种互动一致性纠缠理论，用于解释智能样粒子的行为。",
