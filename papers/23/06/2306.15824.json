    "abstract": "The number of end-to-end speech recognition models grows every year. These models are often adapted to new domains or languages resulting in a proliferation of expert systems that achieve great results on target data, while generally showing inferior performance outside of their domain of expertise. We explore combination of such experts via confidence-based ensembles: ensembles of models where only the output of the most-confident model is used. We assume that models' target data is not available except for a small validation set. We demonstrate effectiveness of our approach with two applications. First, we show that a confidence-based ensemble of 5 monolingual models outperforms a system where model selection is performed via a dedicated language identification block. Second, we demonstrate that it is possible to combine base and adapted models to achieve strong results on both original and target data. We validate all our results on multiple datasets and model architectures.",

    "translated_abstract": "每年端到端语音识别模型的数量不断增长。这些模型经常被调整到新领域或语言，导致专家系统大量涌现，在目标数据上取得了很好的结果，但在自己专业领域之外的性能却相对较差。我们通过基于置信度的集成来探索这些专家模型的组合：在模型中只使用最有信心的模型的输出。我们假设模型的目标数据除了一个小的验证集外是不可用的。我们通过两个应用程序展示了我们方法的有效性。首先，我们展示了一个由5个单语模型组成的基于置信度的集成优于通过专用语言识别模块进行模型选择的系统。其次，我们证明了可以将基础模型和调整模型相结合，在原始和目标数据上取得强大的结果。我们在多个数据集和模型架构上验证了所有结果。",
