    "translated_abstract": "领域泛化（DG）要求为未知目标域进行训练，且在推理时需要成功应用于任意（甚至是未见）的目标域。本文提出了一种简单而有效的方法来解决这个难题。我们提出了测试时间风格转换（test-time style shifting），在进行预测之前，将测试样本的风格（与源域存在较大差异的）转换为最接近模型已知的源域，从而使模型能够应对具有任意风格统计的任何目标域，无需在测试时进行额外的模型更新。此外，我们提出了风格平衡（style balancing），它为最大化测试时间风格转换的优势提供了良好的平台，同时解决了DG特定的不平衡问题。所提出的思路易于实现，且成功地完成了领域泛化任务。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method called test-time style shifting that allows models to handle domain generalization tasks with arbitrary styles without additional model updates, by shifting the style of a test sample to the nearest source domain at inference time. Additionally, style balancing is introduced to address domain generalization-specific imbalance issues."
