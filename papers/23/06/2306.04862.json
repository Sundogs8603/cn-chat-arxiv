    "translated_abstract": "由于对机器学习中隐私的担忧，联邦学习（FL）在2017年被发明，其中客户端（如移动设备）训练模型并将更新发送到集中式服务器。随机选择客户端进行FL可能会对学习性能造成伤害，因为原因各异。许多研究提出了解决FL客户端选择挑战的方法。然而，这一主题的系统性文献综述（SLR）不存在。本文的SLR调查了联邦学习中客户端选择的现状，并回答了挑战、解决方案和评估解决方案时使用的指标。我们对47篇主要研究进行了系统综述。在客户端选择方面，主要挑战是异质性、资源分配、通信成本和公平性。客户选择方案旨在通过专注于上述一项或几项挑战来改进原始的随机选择算法。最常用的指标是测试准确性与通信轮次。",
