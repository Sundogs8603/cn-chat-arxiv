    "abstract": "We consider the problem of fair column subset selection. In particular, we assume that two groups are present in the data, and the chosen column subset must provide a good approximation for both, relative to their respective best rank-k approximations. We show that this fair setting introduces significant challenges: in order to extend known results, one cannot do better than the trivial solution of simply picking twice as many columns as the original methods. We adopt a known approach based on deterministic leverage-score sampling, and show that merely sampling a subset of appropriate size becomes NP-hard in the presence of two groups. Whereas finding a subset of two times the desired size is trivial, we provide an efficient algorithm that achieves the same guarantees with essentially 1.5 times that size. We validate our methods through an extensive set of experiments on real-world data.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑公平的列子集选择问题。特别地，我们假设数据中存在两个群体，并且所选列子集必须相对于它们各自的最佳秩-k逼近提供良好的近似。我们证明了这种公平设置引入了重大挑战：为了扩展已知结果，人们不能做得比简单地选择原始方法的两倍列更好。我们采用了基于确定性杠杆分数采样的已知方法，并且在存在两个群体的情况下，仅仅采样适当大小的子集就变得NP难。而找到两倍于所需大小的子集则非常简单，我们提供了一种有效的算法，它可以在基本上1.5倍的大小的情况下实现相同的保证。我们通过对真实世界数据的广泛实验验证了我们的方法。",
