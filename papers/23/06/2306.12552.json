    "translated_abstract": "最近，文本生成中的常识推理引起了广泛关注。生成式常识推理是一项任务，要求机器在给定一组关键词的情况下，用常识合理性组合出一句连贯的句子。虽然现有的针对生成式常识推理的数据集依focus everyday scenarios，但是机器在特定的地理和时间背景下理解的能力尚不清楚。我们将这一具有挑战性的任务形式化为SituatedGen，要求具有常识推理能力的机器生成一对对比句子，给定的关键词包括地理或时间实体。我们引入一份相应的英语数据集，其中包含8,268对对比句子，这些句子建立在现有的几个常识推理基准上，人工工作量最小。实验表明，最先进的生成式语言模型难以生成具有常识合理性的句子，并且仍然远远落后于人类表现。",
