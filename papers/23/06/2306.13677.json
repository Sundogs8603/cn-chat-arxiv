    "abstract": "We propose a social welfare maximizing market mechanism for an energy community that aggregates individual and community-shared energy resources under a general net energy metering (NEM) policy. Referred to as Dynamic NEM (D-NEM), the proposed mechanism dynamically sets the community NEM price based on aggregated community resources. D-NEM guarantees a higher benefit to each community member than possible outside the community, and no sub-communities would be better off departing from its parent community. D-NEM aligns each member's incentive with that of the community such that each member maximizing individual surplus under D-NEM results in maximum community social welfare. Empirical studies compare the proposed mechanism with existing benchmarks, demonstrating its member and community-level welfare benefits.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个社会福利最大化的市场机制，用于将个人和共享社区能源资源聚合在一起，并根据一般的净能计量政策来动态设置社区净能计量价格。此机制被称为动态净能计量（D-NEM），它可以保证每个社区成员获得的利益高于社区外可能获得的利益，而没有子社区会更好地脱离其母体社区。D-NEM将每个成员的激励与社区的激励相一致，以便在D-NEM下最大化个体余额的每个成员都会带来最大社区社会福利。实证研究将所提出的机制与现有基准进行了比较，证明了其对成员和社区福利的益处。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a mechanism called \"Dynamic NEM\" for energy communities, which dynamically sets the community net energy metering price based on aggregated resources, ensures higher member benefits, aligns each member's incentive with the community's, and maximizes community social welfare. Empirical studies demonstrate its benefits compared to existing benchmarks."
