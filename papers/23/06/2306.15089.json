    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于高阶动态模态分解（HODMD）的方法，用于对位于伦敦地下隧道中的改造农业农场的能量行为进行建模、分析和预测。在这个农场中，观测到的测量数据受到噪声和偶尔的瞬态条件的影响。HODMD 是一种数据驱动的降阶建模方法，通常用于分析和预测流体动力学中高噪声和复杂流动，或者来自动力系统的任何类型的复杂数据。HODMD 是经典动态模态分解方法（DMD）的最新扩展，专门用于处理测量数据的谱复杂度高于其空间复杂度的场景，例如农场的环境行为。HODMD将时间数据分解为物理含义的DMD模态的线性展开，采用时延嵌入方法进行半自动处理。我们使用实际测量的数据将HODMD应用于三个季节的情景中。",
