    "translated_abstract": "由于其优异的机械和化学性能，Ti-Al基材料在汽车、航空航天和国防等众多工程领域引起了极大的兴趣。由于其低密度、高强度以及抗腐蚀和抗氧化性，这些金属间化合物合金和复合金属-金属复合材料已经找到了各种应用。本研究深入研究了Ti-Al系统的界面动力学，特别关注于TiAl3晶界在实验热处理条件下Ti和Al原子的行为。通过分子动力学和马尔可夫状态模型分析的组合，我们对形成TiAl3所涉及的动力学过程进行了详细研究。分子动力学模拟表明，在热处理的早期阶段，Al原子通过TiAl3晶界朝Ti表面扩散是主要过程。马尔可夫状态建模则可以定位并确认过程中的关键步骤。",
