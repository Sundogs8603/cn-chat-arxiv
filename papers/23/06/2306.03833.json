Timely prediction of patient dropout enables stakeholders to take proactive steps to address patients' concerns, potentially improving retention rates. In virtual health, the information asymmetries inherent in its delivery format, between different stakeholders, and across different healthcare delivery systems hinder the performance of existing predictive methods. To resolve those information asymmetries, we propose a Multimodal Dynamic Knowledge-driven Dropout Prediction (MDKDP) framework that learns implicit and explicit knowledge from doctor-patient dialogues and the dynamic and complex networks of various stakeholders in both online and offline healthcare delivery systems. We evaluate MDKDP by partnering with one of the largest virtual health platforms in China. MDKDP improves the ",

    "translated_abstract": "虚拟健康被誉为医疗保健交付中的改变性力量。然而，它的退出问题是至关重要的，会导致较差的健康结果，增加健康、社会和经济成本。及时预测患者的退出使股东能够采取积极的步骤，解决患者的问题，可能提高保留率。为了解决这些信息不对称问题，我们提出了一种多模态动态知识驱动退出预测（MDKDP）框架，该框架从在线和离线医疗保健交付系统的医生患者对话、各个股东的动态和复杂网络中学习隐式和显式知识。我们通过与中国最大的虚拟健康平台之一合作来评估MDKDP。MDKDP提高了退出预测的性能。",
