Therefore, we propose Busyness Graph Neural Network (BysGNN), a temporal graph neural network designed to learn and uncover the underlying multi-context correlations between POIs for accurate visit forecasting. Unlike other approaches where only time-series data is used to learn a dynamic graph, BysGNN utilizes all contextual information and time-series data to learn an accurate dynamic graph representation. By incorporating all contextual, temporal, and spatial signals, we observe a significant improvement in our forecasting accuracy over state-of-t",

    "translated_abstract": "在城市地区预测兴趣点（POI）的访问量对于规划和决策是至关重要的，涉及领域包括城市规划、交通管理、公共卫生和社会研究。尽管这个问题可以被看作是多元时间序列预测任务，但目前的方法不能充分利用POIs之间不断变化的多背景相关性。因此，我们提出了一种称为忙碌图神经网络（BysGNN）的临时图神经网络，旨在学习和揭示POIs之间的潜在多背景相关性，以准确预测访问量。与其他仅使用时间序列数据来学习动态图的方法不同，BysGNN利用所有背景信息和时间序列数据来学习准确的动态图表示。通过结合所有背景、时间和空间信号，我们观察到预测准确性显著提高，超越了当前最先进的方法。",
