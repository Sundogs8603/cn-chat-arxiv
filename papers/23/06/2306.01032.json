    "translated_abstract": "多智能体学习相对于单智能体学习更加困难、不稳定和不可预测。为了实现自我对弈平衡的收敛，许多专门的启发式方法和技术已经设计出来。其中一个备受赞誉的方法是使用动态自适应学习率。虽然这样的技术已知可以在小规模游戏中提高收敛保证，但在更大的智能体群体中分析这些技术就困难多了。最近的研究表明，即使只有两个策略，使用固定学习率的学习也会在智能体数量足够大的情况下变得混沌。在这项工作中，我们展示了即使对于普遍的乘法权重更新算法，大量混合策略的情况下，混沌现象在使用自适应学习率时仍然存在。在技术层面上，由于系统的非自治性质，我们的方法是基于扩散分析的。",
