    "translated_abstract": "现有的监督关系抽取方法在闭集场景下取得了令人瞩目的性能，即在训练和测试过程中关系保持不变。在更现实的开放集场景中，测试集中可能出现未知关系。由于缺乏未知关系的监督信号，一个表现良好的闭集关系抽取器仍然会将其自信地错误归类为已知关系。本文提出了一种未知感知训练方法，通过动态合成负实例来对模型进行规范化。为了促进紧凑的决策边界，需要“困难”的负实例。受到文本敌对攻击的启发，我们改进原始训练实例，自适应地应用小而关键的扰动，从而合成更有可能被模型误分类为已知关系的负实例。实验结果表明，该方法在不损害已知关系检测的情况下实现了 SOTA 的未知关系检测。",
