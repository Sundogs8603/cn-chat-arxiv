    "translated_abstract": "机构投资者的最优投资组合执行一直是一个具有挑战性的问题。交易者面临平均交易价格和不确定性之间的权衡，传统方法受到了维数灾难的影响。在本文中，我们提出了一个四步数值框架，用于解决多个市场制度存在的最优投资组合执行问题，其中基于马尔可夫过程的基础制度转换。市场冲击成本以暂时部分和永久部分建模，其中前者仅影响当前交易，而后者具有持久性。我们的方法接受通用形式的冲击成本函数。首先，我们根据估计的交易成本函数计算近似正交组合；第二，我们利用动态规划学习每个近似正交组合的最优卖出时间表；第三，神经网络的权重使用前一步骤建议的策略进行预训练；最后，训练神经网络以优化暂时和永久市场冲击成本之间的权衡。我们通过数值模拟和经验研究测试了我们方法的性能。结果表明，所提出的方法可以有效地优化在非线性冲击成本下的制度转换市场中的投资组合执行问题。",
