    "translated_abstract": "动态任务分配涉及将到达的任务分配给有限的资源，以最小化分配的总成本。为了达到最优的任务分配，必须先对分配问题进行建模。虽然存在用于模拟、执行和解决问题不同方面的形式化方法，如马尔可夫决策过程和Petri网格，但不存在一种集成建模技术。为填补这一空白，本文提出了Action-Evolution Petri网格(A-E PN)作为一种建模和解决动态任务分配问题的框架。A-E PN提供了一种统一的建模技术，可以表示动态任务分配问题的所有要素。此外，A-E PN模型是可执行的，这意味着它们可以用于强化学习(RL)学习接近最优的分配策略，无需额外的建模工作。为了评估框架，我们定义了一个原型分配问题的分类法。",
