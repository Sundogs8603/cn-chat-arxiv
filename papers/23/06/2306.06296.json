This is in part because the de-facto standard model for choice RTs, the diffusion decision model (DDM), does not admit tractable, differentiable inference. The DDM thus cannot be easily integrated with flexible models for continuous, multivariate function approximation, particularly Gaussian process (GP) models. We propose a novel differentiable approximation to the DDM likelihood using a family of known, skewed three-parameter distributions.

    "translated_abstract": "偏好学习和心理物理学中的人类选择预测模型通常仅考虑二进制响应数据，需要大量样本才能准确学习偏好或感知检测阈值。然而，用于做出每个选择的响应时间（RT）捕获了关于决策过程的额外信息，但是现有模型将RT用于选择预测的设置是充分参数化的或离散的刺激设置。这部分是因为选择RT的事实上的标准模型 - 扩散判定模型（DDM），不允许可处理，可微分的推断。因此，DDM不能轻松地与灵活的连续多元函数逼近模型，特别是高斯过程（GP）模型集成。我们提出了一种新颖的可微分近似DDM似然函数，使用已知的带偏三参数分布族。然后，我们使用这个新的似然函数将RT纳入二进制选择的GP模型中。我们的RT选择GP使得更容易在连续多元函数逼近模型下进行选择预测和函数估计。",
