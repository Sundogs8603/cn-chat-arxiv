    "abstract": "Efficient navigation towards an audio-goal necessitates an embodied agent to not only possess the ability to use audio-visual cues effectively, but also be equipped to actively (but occasionally) seek human/oracle assistance without sacrificing autonomy, e.g., when it is uncertain of where to navigate towards locating a noisy or sporadic audio goal. To this end, we present CAVEN -- a conversational audio-visual embodied navigation agent that is capable of posing navigation questions to a human/oracle and processing the oracle responses; both in free-form natural language. At the core of CAVEN is a multimodal hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) setup that is equipped with a high-level policy that is trained to choose from one of three low-level policies (at every step), namely: (i) to navigate using audio-visual cues, or (ii) to frame a question to the oracle and receive a short or detailed response, or (iii) ask generic questions (when unsure of what to ask) and receive instructio",

    "translated_abstract": "为了高效地导航到一个听觉目标，一个具有固定自主权的实体必须不仅要有能力有效地使用视听线索, 而且还要有能力在不牺牲自主性的情况下主动寻求人类/神谕的帮助，例如，当不确定导航到哪里寻找嘈杂或间歇性听觉目标时。因此，我们提出了CAVEN-一种具有对话功能的音频视觉导航代理，能够向人类/神谕提出导航问题并处理神谕的自由形式自然语言回答。在CAVEN的核心是一个多模态分层强化学习(RL)设置，它配备了一个高级策略，该策略经过训练，可以在每一步从三个低级策略中选择一个，即：(i)使用视听线索进行导航，或(ii)向神谕提出问题并接收短或详细的回答，或(iii)提问普遍问题(当不确定该问什么时)并获得指导",
