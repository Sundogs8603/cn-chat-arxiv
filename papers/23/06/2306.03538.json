    "translated_abstract": "为了缓解基于人体姿态关键点的行人检测算法中部分遮挡带来的挑战，我们提出了一种称为分离和降维基于生成对抗性补全网络(SDR-GAIN)的新型行人姿势关键点补全方法。首先，我们利用OpenPose在图像中估计行人的姿态。然后，我们对由于遮挡或其他因素而不完整的行人头部和躯干关键点进行维度缩减，以增强特征并进一步统一特征分布。最后，我们引入了基于生成对抗网络(GAN)框架的两种生成模型，这些模型融合了Huber损失、残差结构和L1正则化来生成部分遮挡行人不完整头部和躯干姿态关键点的缺失部分，从而实现了姿态补全。我们在MS COCO和JAAD数据集上的实验表明，SDR-GAIN的性能优于基本的GAIN框架。",
