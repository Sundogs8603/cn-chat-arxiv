    "translated_abstract": "最近开发了多种人工神经网络（ANNs）作为Cox比例风险模型，以基于肿瘤转录组预测癌症预后。然而，它们并没有表现出比传统有规则化的Cox回归显着更好的性能。在有限数量的数据样本和高维特征空间存在的情况下，训练具有高预测能力的ANN是具有挑战性的。图像分类的最新进展表明，对比学习可以通过从有限数量的数据样本中学习良好的特征表示来促进进一步的学习任务。在本文中，我们将监督对比学习应用于肿瘤基因表达和临床数据，以在低维空间中学习特征表示。然后，我们使用这些学习到的特征来训练Cox模型，以预测癌症预后。使用来自The Cancer Genome Atlas（TCGA）的数据，我们证明了我们基于对比学习的Cox模型能够通过学习基因表达数据的良好特征表征，显著提高癌症预后预测的性能。",
