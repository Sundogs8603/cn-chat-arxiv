    "translated_abstract": "从视觉观察中学习到的动力学模型在各种机器人操作任务中表现出很好的效果。学习这种动力学模型的一个关键问题是使用什么场景表示。之前的研究通常假设固定维度或分辨率的表示，这对简单任务可能效率低下，对复杂任务可能无效。在这项工作中，我们研究如何学习不同抽象层次的动态和自适应表示，以实现效率和效果之间的最优平衡。具体而言，我们构建了动态分辨率的粒子环境表示，并使用图神经网络（GNNs）学习了统一的动力学模型，允许连续选择抽象层次。在测试时，代理可以自适应地确定每个模型预测控制（MPC）步骤的最佳分辨率。我们在对象堆叠操作中评估了我们的方法，这是我们在烹饪, 农业等领域经常遇到的任务。",
