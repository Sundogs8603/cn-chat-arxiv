    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于隐私问题，电子商务网站无法为每个交易数据条目提供标识号（用户ID）。因为大多数推荐方法假定所有数据都被分配了用户ID，所以它们不能应用于没有用户ID的数据。最近研究了基于会话信息的会话推荐（SBR），该方法基于用户的短期行为信息。常规的SBR只使用与感兴趣的项目相关的信息来进行推荐（例如，在EC站点上使用项目ID）。特别是在EC网站的情况下，记录的数据包括被购买的物品名称、物品价格、类别层次结构以及用户的性别和地区。在本研究中，我们为没有用户ID和会话ID的EC网站的购买历史数据定义了伪会话。最后，我们提出了一种CoHHGN+会话推荐方法，它使用协同导向的异构超图和全局图网络。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种新方法CoHHGN+，用于解决缺乏用户ID的电商网站数据的推荐问题。该方法使用了定义的伪会话以及包括价格、类别、性别和地区等用户信息，得到了较好的推荐结果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new method, CoHHGN+, to solve the recommendation problem in e-commerce websites with data lacking user IDs. The method uses a defined pseudo-session and includes user information such as price, category, gender, and region, achieving better recommendation results."
