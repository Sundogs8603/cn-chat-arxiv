    "translated_abstract": "在多边平台中，平台与卖家（项目）和客户（用户）等各种各样的利益相关者互动，每个相关者都有自己的期望结果，寻找合适的平衡点变得非常复杂。在这项工作中，我们研究了“公平成本”，它捕捉了平台在平衡不同利益相关者利益时可能做出的妥协。出于这个目的，我们提出了一个公平推荐框架，其中平台在插值项目和用户公平性约束时最大化其收益。我们在一个更现实但具有挑战性的在线设置中进一步研究了公平推荐问题，在这种情况下，平台缺乏了解用户偏好的知识，只能观察二进制购买决策。为了解决这个问题，我们设计了一种低后悔的在线优化算法，它在维护平台收益的同时管理项目和用户公平性之间的权衡。我们的实验证明了我们提出的框架在实现公平推荐同时保持高收益方面的有效性。",
