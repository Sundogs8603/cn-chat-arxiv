    "translated_abstract": "实验者通常收集基线数据来研究异质性。本文提出了第一个关于可观测处理效应方差的有效置信区间。传统方法在可观测处理效应方差为零时，会产生错误的覆盖范围。因此，即使不存在异质性，实际操作者也容易检测到。当边界处于局部退化状态时，所有高效估计器都具有局部退化的影响函数，并且可能不具有渐近正态性。本文解决了具有预测第一阶段的广泛类多步估计器的问题。我的置信区间考虑了极限分布中的高阶项，并且计算速度很快。我还发现了VCATE与决定谁应受治疗的问题之间的新联系。治疗目标的收益(急剧)受到VCATE平方根的一半的限制。最后，我通过模拟和重新分析马拉维的实验，证明了优异的性能。",
