    "translated_abstract": "在1991年，H\\'ebrard引入了一种单词的分解方法，被证明是研究单词的离散因子（也称为（离散）子串或子序列）的强大工具。基于此，Karandikar和Schnoebelen首先引入了$k$-丰富性的概念，随后Barker等人引入了$k$-普遍性的概念。在2022年，Fleischmann等人通过交集化单词的拱形分解和其逆序来推广了拱形分解。尽管作者仅仅使用这种分解方法来研究最短的缺失离散因子，但在本研究中我们将对这种新的$\\alpha$-$\\beta$-分解进行研究。我们在$k$-普遍性单词的$\\alpha$-$\\beta$-分解中将著名的Simon同余特征化为$1$-普遍性单词。此外，我们将这些结果应用于二元单词。在这种特殊情况下，我们得到了类别的完全刻画并计算了同余的指数。最后，我们开始研究三元情况，展示了...",
