By resorting to robust mean estimators for rewards, we first propose two frameworks for heavy-tailed MDPs, i.e., one is for value iteration and another is for policy optimization.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了差分隐私(DP)限制下的重尾奖励的（有限步骤表格）马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)问题。与先前的私有强化学习研究通常假设奖励来自一些有界或次高斯分布以确保DP相比，我们考虑奖励分布只有有限的$(1+v)$阶矩的情况，$v \\in (0,1]$。通过使用奖励的健壮均值估计器，我们首先提出了两种针对重尾MDP的框架，即一个用于价值迭代，另一个用于策略优化。在每个框架下，我们考虑了联合差分隐私(JDP)和本地差分隐私(LDP)模型。基于我们的框架，我们为JDP和LDP情况提供了遗憾上限，并表明分布的矩和隐私预算都对遗憾有重要影响。最后，我们建立了遗憾最小化的下限。",
