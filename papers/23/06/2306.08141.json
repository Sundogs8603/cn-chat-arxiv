In this work, we investigate how people use text-to-image models to generate desired target images. To study this interaction, we created ArtWhisperer, an online game where users are given a target image and are tasked with iteratively finding a prompt that creates a similar-looking image as the target. Through this game, we recorded over 50,000 human-AI interactions; each interaction corresponds to one text prompt created by a user and the corresponding generated image. The majority of these are repeated interactions where a user iterates to find the best prompt for their target image, making this a unique sequential dataset for studying human-AI collaborations. In an initial analysis of this dataset, we identify several characteristics of prompt interactions and user strategies. People submit diverse prompts and are able to discover a variety of text descriptions that generate",

    "translated_abstract": "随着生成型人工智能越来越普及，研究人类用户如何与这些模型交互变得越来越重要。在这项工作中，我们研究了人们如何使用文本到图像的模型生成所需的目标图像。为了研究这种交互，我们创建了ArtWhisperer，这是一个在线游戏，用户会得到一个目标图像，并需要反复尝试不同的提示词，以便生成类似目标图像的图像。通过这个游戏，我们记录了50,000多个人工智能-人类交互的记录；每个交互都对应着用户创建的一个提示词和相应生成的图像。大多数记录都是重复的交互，用户通过反复尝试找到最佳的提示词以生成目标图像，这使得这个数据集成为研究人工智能与人类协作的独特连续数据集。在对这个数据集的初步分析中，我们发现了一些提示词交互和用户策略的特征。人们提交了各种各样的提示词，并能够发现生成各种文本描述的图像。",
