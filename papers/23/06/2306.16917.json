Deformable odometry and SLAM pipelines, which tackle the most challenging scenario of exploratory trajectories, suffer from a lack of robustness and proper quantitative evaluation methodologies. To tackle this issue with a common benchmark, we introduce the Drunkard's Dataset, a challenging collection of synthetic data targeting visual navigation and reconstruction in deformable environments.

    "translated_abstract": "估计变形场景中的相机运动是一个复杂而开放的研究挑战。大多数现有的非刚性结构运动技术假设在建立锚定参考时观察到除变形场景部分外还存在静态场景部分。然而，在某些相关应用案例中，如内窥镜检查，这个假设不成立。解决探索型轨迹最具挑战性的情况下鲁棒性和适当的定量评估方法的可变形里程计和SLAM管道的问题。为了解决共同基准的问题，我们介绍了“醉汉数据集”，它是一个具有挑战性的合成数据集，针对可变形环境中的视觉导航和重建。该数据集是第一个包含地面真实情况的三维场景内每个表面随时间呈现非刚性变形的大型探索相机轨迹集合。通过在逼真的三维建筑中进行模拟，我们获得了大量的数据。",
