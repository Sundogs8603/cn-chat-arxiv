    "translated_abstract": "域外图像通用化对于许多实际应用来说都是至关重要的。现有方法忽视了丢弃与标签无关的输入中的虚假或噪声特征。此外，它们主要进行实例级别的类不变图学习，并未充分利用图实例之间的结构化类别关系。在本研究中，我们致力于在一个统一的框架中解决这些问题，称为个别和结构化图信息瓶颈（IS-GIB）。为了消除由分布偏移引起的类别虚假特征，我们提出个别图信息瓶颈（I-GIB），通过最小化输入图与其嵌入之间的互信息来丢弃不相关信息。为了利用结构内部和跨域之间的关联，我们提出了结构化图信息瓶颈（S-GIB）。特别是对于一批具有多个域的图，S-GIB首先计算成对的输入-输入、嵌入-嵌入等。",
