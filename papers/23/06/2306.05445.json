    "translated_abstract": "深度学习的进步大大提高了分子结构预测的精度。然而，许多对于实际应用来说重要的宏观观察结果不仅仅是一个分子结构的函数，而是由结构的平衡分布决定的。获得这些分布的传统方法，如分子动力学模拟，计算代价昂贵且常常难以处理。本文中，我们引入了一种新的深度学习框架，称为Distributional Graphormer（DiG），以预测分子系统的平衡分布。受热力学中的退火过程启发，DiG使用深度神经网络将一个简单的分布转化为平衡分布，条件是对分子系统的描述符，如化学图或蛋白质序列。这个框架使得各种构型的高效生成成为可能，并提供状态密度的估计。我们展示了我们的方法在预测各种分子系统的热力学和动力学性质方面的有效性和通用性。",
