    "translated_abstract": "随着分布式边缘计算资源的普及，6G移动网络将发展成为一个连接智能的网络。在这条线路上，将联邦学习纳入移动边缘的提议近年来引起了相当大的兴趣。然而，联邦学习的部署面临着重大的挑战，因为庞大的资源受限的物联网设备几乎无法支持设备上的模型训练。这导致了Split Learning (SL)的出现，它使服务器处理主要的训练工作负载，同时增强数据隐私。在本文中，我们简要概述了SL的关键发展，并阐述了其与无线边缘网络的无缝集成。我们首先说明了定制的6G体系结构，以支持边缘SL。然后，我们研究了边缘SL的关键设计问题，包括创新的资源高效学习框架和在单个边缘服务器下的资源管理策略。此外，我们扩展了Split Learning模型的多边缘服务器方案。最后，我们提出了全面的未来研究方向和一些刺激人心的SL在6G边缘网络中的应用。",
