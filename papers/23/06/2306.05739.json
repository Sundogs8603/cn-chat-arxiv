    "translated_abstract": "生物进化系统学现在是生命科学中的一个基础，可以阐明生命早期支系和传染病的起源和传播。然而，从可能的树的广阔空间中找到合适的系统树仍然具有挑战性。为了解决这个问题，我们首次在连续空间中进行了树形系统探索和推断，使梯度计算成为可能。这种连续的放松方式允许在有根和无根树中跨越树空间，且不易收敛到局部最小值。我们的方法优于当前最佳的无根树推断方法，并且在模拟中准确地推断出树和树根。该方法在实际数据中也很有效，我们在颌口动物的系统发育中证明了这一点。事实上，仅具有超指数信号的少数基因通常足以分辨脊椎动物的主要谱系。通过我们的方法，我们希望加速发现生命科学中的新进化发现。",
