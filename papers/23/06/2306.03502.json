    "abstract": "On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, starting what is now known as the Russo-Ukrainian War, initiating an online discourse on social media. Twitter as one of the most popular SNs, with an open and democratic character, enables a transparent discussion among its large user base. Unfortunately, this often leads to Twitter's policy violations, propaganda, abusive actions, civil integrity violation, and consequently to user accounts' suspension and deletion. This study focuses on the Twitter suspension mechanism and the analysis of shared content and features of the user accounts that may lead to this. Toward this goal, we have obtained a dataset containing 107.7M tweets, originating from 9.8 million users, using Twitter API. We extract the categories of shared content of the suspended accounts and explain their characteristics, through the extraction of text embeddings in junction with cosine similarity clustering. Our results reveal scam campaigns taking advantage of trending top",

    "translated_abstract": "2022年2月24日，俄罗斯入侵乌克兰，开始了现在已知的俄乌战争，并在社交媒体上引发了在线话语。Twitter作为最受欢迎的社交网络之一，以其开放和民主的特点，在其庞大的用户群中实现了透明的讨论。不幸的是，这往往会导致Twitter的政策违规、宣传、滥用行为、侵犯公民权利，因此导致用户账户被封禁和删除。本研究着重探讨了Twitter的封禁机制，并分析了可能导致账户被封禁的共享内容和用户账户的特征。为此，我们利用Twitter API获得了包含107.7M条推文的数据集，来自980万用户。我们提取了被封禁账户的共享内容类别，并通过提取文本嵌入和余弦相似性聚类来解释其特征。我们的研究结果揭示了一些滥用Twitter政策标准的骗子活动、垃圾邮件和宣传活动。此外，我们发现相对于粉丝数较少的账户，拥有更多粉丝的账户更有可能被封禁。这些发现可以为Twitter和其他社交网络改进其内容过滤机制，最小化有害内容的传播提供有用的参考。",

These findings can help Twitter and other social networks improve their content filtering mechanism."
