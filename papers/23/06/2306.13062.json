In this study, a deep learning-based semi-automatic named entity recognition system has been implemented with a focus on resumes in the field of IT. Firstly, resumes of employees from five different IT related fields has been annotated. Six transformer based pre-trained models have been adapted to named entity recognition problem using the annotated data. These models have been selected among popular models in the natural language processing field. The obtained system can recognize eight different entity types which are city, date, degree, diploma major, job title, language, country and skill. Models u",

    "translated_abstract": "命名实体识别（NER）被用于从各种文档和文本中提取信息，例如姓名和日期。从简历中提取教育和工作经历信息以进行筛选非常重要。考虑到简历中的所有信息必须手动输入公司系统，自动化这个过程将为公司节省时间。在本研究中，重点关注IT领域的简历，实现了一种基于深度学习的半自动命名实体识别系统。首先，标注了来自五个不同IT相关领域员工的简历。使用标注数据，调整了六个基于转换器的预训练模型以解决命名实体识别问题。这些模型是在自然语言处理领域中流行的模型之一。所得系统可以识别八种不同的实体类型，包括城市、日期、学位、毕业证主修、职称、语言、国家和技能。",
