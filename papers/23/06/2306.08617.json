    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种近似计算有效$p$-阻抗并将其应用于多类聚类。基于图拉普拉斯和其$p$-拉普拉斯推广的谱方法一直是非欧几里得聚类技术的支柱。$p$-拉普拉斯的优点在于参数$p$对聚类结构具有可控偏倚。$p$-拉普拉斯特征向量法的缺点在于难以计算第三和更高阶特征向量。因此，我们动机在于使用由$p$-拉普拉斯引导的$p$-阻抗进行聚类。对于$p$-阻抗而言，小$p$会偏向于具有高内部连通性的聚类，而大$p$则会偏向于大小“范围”的聚类，即更小的簇内顶点之间的最短路径距离。然而，计算$p$-阻抗成本很高。我们通过开发$p$-阻抗的近似方法来克服这一问题。我们证明了上下界。",
