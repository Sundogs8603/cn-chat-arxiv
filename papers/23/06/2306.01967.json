    "translated_abstract": "综合控制估计量 (Abadie等人，2010) 在结果是潜在预测值的线性函数并且在治疗前，可以用合成控制近似治疗单位的情况下，渐近无偏。当结果是非线性时，综合控制估计量的偏差可能非常严重。在本文中，我们提供了当结果是非线性的情况下，使综合控制估计量渐近无偏的条件，并提出一种灵活的数据驱动方法以选择合成控制权重。蒙特卡罗模拟表明，与竞争方法相比，当结果是线性的时，非线性综合控制方法具有类似或更好的性能；当结果是非线性时，性能更好，并且置信区间在各种情况下都有很好的覆盖概率。在实证应用中，我们利用2018年1月至2019年9月的数据和一组控制变量来说明该方法，估计了2019年反引渡法修订草案抗议活动对香港GDP增长的影响，并量化了这种影响的大小。",
