    "translated_abstract": "大量与人类相关的数据被收集用于训练神经网络进行计算机视觉任务。我们发现了一种关于软件工程师的重大冲突：在更好地开发人工智能系统与远离敏感训练数据之间存在一大矛盾。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种高效的隐私保护学习范式，其中图像被加密成“人类不可感知，机器可识别”状态，通过以下两种加密策略之一来实现：(1) 将图像随机洗牌成一组相等大小的小块，(2) 对图像的子块进行混合。然后，对视觉转换器进行最小的适配，使其能够学习加密图像的计算机视觉任务，包括图像分类和目标检测。在 ImageNet 和 COCO 上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明，所提出的方法在准确性方面与竞争方法相当。解密加密图像需要解决 NP 难的拼图问题或病态的反问题，这是经验证明的。",
