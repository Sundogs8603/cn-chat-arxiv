    "translated_abstract": "在现实生活中的决策问题中，确定因素对决策属性的影响是其中主要任务之一。为了对决策属性产生最大影响，找到因素之间合适的层次结构，并确定它们在系统中的重要性价值就变得非常重要。诠释结构模型(ISM)是一种广泛使用的基于专家意见挖掘因素相互影响的层次构建方法。本文讨论了常规ISM方法在因素之间密集关联的系统中的一个主要缺点。我们称这样的系统为“密集系统”。我们提出了一种新颖的迭代层次构建技术，称为“迭代层次和排名过程”（IHRP），该方法在这样的密集系统中的效果显著。为了考虑专家意见的模糊性，研究工作中使用了直觉模糊语言学方法。本文提出了一种相对重要性的两阶段计算方法。",
