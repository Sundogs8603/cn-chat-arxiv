Most existing methods focus on approximating the object-conditional validity of the intervals by partitioning or re-weighting the calibration set. Our strategy is new and conceptually different. Instead of re-weighting the calibration data, we redefine the conformity measure through a trainable change of variables, $A \\to \\phi_X(A)$, that depends explicitly on the object attributes, $X$. Under certain conditions and if $\\phi_X$ is monotonic in $A$ for any $X$, the transformations produce prediction intervals that are guaranteed to be marginally valid and have $X$-dependent sizes. We describe how to parameterize and train $\\phi_X$ to maximize the interval efficiency. Contrary to other CP-aware training methods, the objective function is smooth and can be minimized through standard gradient methods without approximations.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了使符合性预测（CP）间隔本地自适应的问题。大多数现有方法集中于通过划分或重新加权校准集来近似间隔的对象条件有效性。我们的策略是新的且概念上不同。我们不是重新加权校准数据，而是通过可训练的变量变换$A \\to \\phi_X(A)$重新定义符合度量，该变换明确地取决于对象属性$X$。在某些条件下，如果$\\phi_X$对于任何$X$在$A$中是单调的，则变换将生成保证是边际有效且具有$X$相关大小的预测区间。我们描述了如何对$\\phi_X$进行参数化和训练以最大化间隔效率。与其他CP-aware训练方法相反，目标函数是平滑的，可以通过标准梯度方法进行最小化而无需进行逼近。",

Training the variable transformation can maximize interval efficiency."
