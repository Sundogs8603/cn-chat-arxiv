    "abstract": "Text correction, especially the semantic correction of more widely used scenes, is strongly required to improve, for the fluency and writing efficiency of the text. An adversarial multi-task learning method is proposed to enhance the modeling and detection ability of character polysemy in Chinese sentence context. Wherein, two models, the masked language model and scoring language model, are introduced as a pair of not only coupled but also adversarial learning tasks. Moreover, the Monte Carlo tree search strategy and a policy network are introduced to accomplish the efficient Chinese text correction task with semantic detection. The experiments are executed on three datasets and five comparable methods, and the experimental results show that our method can obtain good performance in Chinese text correction task for better semantic rationality.",

    "translated_abstract": "文本纠错，尤其是更广泛应用场景下的语义纠错，对于提高文本的流畅性和写作效率有着极高的需求。本文提出了一种对抗多任务学习方法，旨在增强中文句子上下文中字符多义的建模和检测能力。其中，引入了掩码语言模型和评分语言模型作为一对不仅耦合而且对抗的学习任务。此外，还引入了蒙特卡洛树搜索策略和一个策略网络，以实现带有语义检测的高效中文文本纠错任务。实验在三个数据集和五种可比较的方法上进行，实验结果表明，我们的方法在中文文本纠错任务中表现良好，能够更好地实现语义合理性。",
