    "translated_abstract": "神经架构搜索(NAS)通过生成应用自适应的神经架构，被证明是许多任务中有效的方法，但仍面临高计算成本和内存消耗的挑战。与此同时，具有二进制权重和激活的1位卷积神经网络(CNN)在资源有限的嵌入式设备上展现了潜力。一个自然的方法是在统一框架中利用1位CNN来减少NAS的计算和内存成本，同时由于涉及更复杂的过程，搜索1位CNN更具挑战性。在本文中，我们引入了差异性子父神经架构搜索(DCP-NAS)来高效搜索1位CNN，基于在实值模型(父模型)的监督下搜索1位模型(子模型)的新框架。具体而言，我们首先利用父模型计算切线方向，基于切线方向进行切线传播。",
