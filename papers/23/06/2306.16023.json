    "translated_abstract": "针对复杂环境中的时变问题，递归神经网络已经取得了很大的发展，有效地解决了这些问题。然而，由于集中式处理的方式限制，模型性能受到现实中模型和数据的孤立问题等因素的极大影响。因此，分布式人工智能（例如联邦学习）的出现使得模型间的动态聚合成为可能。然而，现有的联邦学习集成过程仍然依赖于服务器，可能给整体模型带来很大的风险。此外，它只允许同质模型之间的协作，并且没有很好的解决方案来处理异构模型之间的交互。因此，我们提出了一种基于联盟区块链网络的分布式计算模型（DCM），以提高整体模型的可信度和异构模型之间的有效协调。此外，我们还提出了一种分布式层级集成（DHI）算法。",
