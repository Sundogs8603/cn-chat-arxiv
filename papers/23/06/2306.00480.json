    "abstract": "Parallel neurosymbolic architectures have been applied effectively in NLP by distilling knowledge from a logic theory into a deep model.However, prior art faces several limitations including supporting restricted forms of logic theories and relying on the assumption of independence between the logic and the deep network. We present Concordia, a framework overcoming the limitations of prior art. Concordia is agnostic both to the deep network and the logic theory offering support for a wide range of probabilistic theories. Our framework can support supervised training of both components and unsupervised training of the neural component. Concordia has been successfully applied to tasks beyond NLP and data classification, improving the accuracy of state-of-the-art on collective activity detection, entity linking and recommendation tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "并行的神经符号结构通过将逻辑理论的知识提取到深度模型中，在NLP中得到有效应用。然而，现有技术仍存在一些限制，包括支持受限形式的逻辑理论，并依赖于逻辑和深度网络之间的独立性假设。本文提出了康科迪亚框架，克服了现有技术的限制。康科迪亚框架既不关注深度网络，也不关注逻辑理论，支持各种概率理论。框架可以支持两个组件的监督训练和神经组件的无监督训练。康科迪亚已成功应用于NLP和数据分类以外的任务，提高了集合活动检测、实体链接和推荐任务的最新准确性。",
