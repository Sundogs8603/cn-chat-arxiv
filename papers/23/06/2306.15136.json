    "translated_abstract": "在自动驾驶系统中，轨迹预测在确保安全和促进平稳导航方面起着至关重要的作用。然而，我们观察到在固定数据集上的预测器准确性与在下游任务中的驾驶性能之间存在显著差异。这种差异源于当前轨迹预测评估协议中忽视了两个因素：1）数据集与实际驾驶场景之间的动力学差距；2）预测器的计算效率。在实际场景中，预测算法影响自动驾驶车辆的行为，进而改变道路上其他参与者的行为。这种互动产生了针对预测器的特定动力学，直接影响预测结果。由于其他参与者的反应在数据集上是预先确定的，因此在固定数据集和实际驾驶场景中进行的评估之间存在显著的动力学差距。此外，仅关注准确性无法满足对预测器动态行为和计算效率的需求。",
