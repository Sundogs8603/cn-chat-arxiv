    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an autonomous information seeking visual question answering framework, AVIS. Our method leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to dynamically strategize the utilization of external tools and to investigate their outputs, thereby acquiring the indispensable knowledge needed to provide answers to the posed questions. Responding to visual questions that necessitate external knowledge, such as \"What event is commemorated by the building depicted in this image?\", is a complex task. This task presents a combinatorial search space that demands a sequence of actions, including invoking APIs, analyzing their responses, and making informed decisions. We conduct a user study to collect a variety of instances of human decision-making when faced with this task. This data is then used to design a system comprised of three components: an LLM-powered planner that dynamically determines which tool to use next, an LLM-powered reasoner that analyzes and extracts key information ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）实现自主信息检索的视觉问答框架AVIS。我们的方法利用LLM动态地制定利用外部工具的策略，并调查它们的输出，从而获取提供所提出问题所需的不可或缺的知识。回答需要外部知识的视觉问题，如“这幅图像所描绘的建筑物是为了纪念哪个事件？”，是一项复杂的任务。这个任务呈现出一个组合搜索空间，需要一系列行动，包括调用API、分析它们的响应并做出明智的决策。我们进行了一个用户研究，收集了人类面对这个任务时各种各样的决策实例。然后利用这些数据设计了一个由三个组件组成的系统：一个由LLM驱动的规划器，动态确定下一个要使用的工具；一个由LLM驱动的推理器，分析并提取关键信息。",
