    "abstract": "PtSe$_2$ is a promising 2D material for nanoelectromechanical sensing and photodetection in the infrared regime. One of its most compelling features is the facile synthesis at temperatures below 500 {\\deg}C, which is compatible with current back-end-of-line semiconductor processing. However, this process generates polycrystalline thin films with nanoflake-like domains of 5 to 100 nm size. To investigate the lateral quantum confinement effect in this size regime, we train a deep neural network to obtain an interatomic potential at DFT accuracy and use that to model ribbons, surfaces, nanoflakes, and nanoplatelets of PtSe$_2$ with lateral widths between 5 to 15 nm. We determine which edge terminations are the most stable and find evidence that the electrical conductivity is localized on the edges for lateral sizes below 10 nm. This suggests that the transport channels in thin films of PtSe$_2$ might be dominated by networks of edges, instead of transport through the layers themselves.",

    "translated_abstract": "PtSe$_2$是一种有前途的二维材料，用于纳米机电感应和红外光探测。其最引人注目的特点之一是在低于500°C的温度下进行的简易合成，与目前的后端半导体加工兼容。然而，这个过程生成了多晶薄膜，具有尺寸为5到100纳米的纳米片状领域。为了研究这个尺寸范围内的横向量子约束效应，我们训练了一个深度神经网络，以DFT精度获取原子间势能，并用它来模拟PtSe$_2$的带状、表面、纳米片和纳米板，横向宽度在5到15纳米之间。我们确定了哪些边缘终止是最稳定的，并发现对于小于10纳米的横向尺寸，电导率局限于边缘。这表明，在PtSe$_2$薄膜中，传输通道可能由边缘网络主导，而不是通过膜本身进行传输。",
    "tldr": "研究者使用深度神经网络模拟了 PtSe$_2$ 不同尺度的纳米结构，发现在 10nm 以下的较小尺寸中，其电传输主要局限于边缘，而非膜本身，这或许会对 PtSe$_2$的应用带来新的研究方向。",
    "en_tdlr": "Researchers simulated PtSe$_2$ nanostructures of different scales using a deep neural network, and found that in sizes smaller than 10nm, the electrical conductivity is mainly localized on the edges rather than the film itself, which may bring new research directions for the application of PtSe$_2$."
