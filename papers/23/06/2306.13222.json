    "translated_abstract": "自主机器人在多个复杂任务的实际场景中得到越来越广泛的应用。在这些情境中，可能存在一种完成所有任务的首选方式，但它经常与最优执行存在冲突。最近的一些研究将基于偏好的规划视为研究重点，但是它们尚未将偏好的概念扩展到机器人对每个任务的行为。在本文中，我们引入了一种新颖的偏好概念，它提供了一种广义框架来表达对单个任务以及它们之间关系的偏好。然后，我们通过扩展A*搜索来进行一种遵循用户偏好和资源最优的行为之间的最优成本偏好权衡（Pareto）分析。进一步地，我们展示了一种通过多目标A*算法的改进来计算整个Pareto前沿（所有最优成本权衡的集合）的方法。我们同时提出了一种高效的规划框架，它能够根据用户的偏好生成Pareto最优的规划方案。",
