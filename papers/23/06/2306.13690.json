    "abstract": "As we deal with the effects of climate change and the increase of global atmospheric temperatures, the accurate tracking and prediction of ice layers within polar ice sheets grows in importance. Studying these ice layers reveals climate trends, how snowfall has changed over time, and the trajectory of future climate and precipitation. In this paper, we propose a machine learning model that uses adaptive, recurrent graph convolutional networks to, when given the amount of snow accumulation in recent years gathered through airborne radar data, predict historic snow accumulation by way of the thickness of deep ice layers. We found that our model performs better and with greater consistency than our previous model as well as equivalent non-temporal, non-geometric, and non-adaptive models.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着应对气候变化和全球大气温度的增加，准确跟踪和预测极地冰层中的冰层厚度变得越来越重要。研究这些冰层揭示了气候趋势，降雪如何随时间变化以及未来气候和降水的轨迹。本文提出了一种机器学习模型，使用自适应、循环的图卷积网络，通过飞行雷达数据收集的近年积雪量，预测历史积雪量，进而预测深层冰层的厚度。我们发现，我们的模型表现更好，且比以前的模型和等效的非时间、非几何和非自适应模型更加一致。",
