    "en_tdlr": "The rapid growth of AI-based text-to-image generation technology is making it increasingly difficult to differentiate between hand-made artworks and AI-generated images. Striking a balance between improving human standards of living and work, and avoiding the exploitation of certain groups of people, is crucial. Gray legal areas and the quick growth of this technology pose risks to artistic and visual domains such as the video game industry, as they may be taken over by AI infrastructure owners. This review paper examines concerns of AI developers and users including identity theft, data laundering and more."
