    "translated_abstract": "定向进化在蛋白工程中扮演着不可或缺的角色，通过修订现有的蛋白序列以获得新的或增强的功能。精确预测蛋白变异体的效应需要深入理解蛋白质结构与功能。虽然大型自监督语言模型仅使用蛋白序列就表现出了出色的零样本推理能力，但这些模型固有地不解释蛋白质结构的空间特征，这对于理解蛋白质折叠稳定性和分子内相互作用至关重要。本文介绍了一种新的预训练框架，它将蛋白一级和三级结构的序列和几何分析器级联起来。通过模拟野生型蛋白质上的自然选择，将变异方向引导到期望的特性上，并基于其执行功能的适应性评估变异体的效应。我们使用一个包含20种蛋白质的公共数据库中的328,594个变异体对所提出的方法进行评估，它在不同的评估指标上表现优于现有的方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel pre-training framework for accurately predicting the effects of protein variants, which cascades sequential and geometric analyzers for protein primary and tertiary structures to guide mutational directions and evaluate the effects of variants based on their fitness to perform the function. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy over different evaluation metrics."
