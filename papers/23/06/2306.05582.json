    "translated_abstract": "最近人工智能领域的进展使得人们重新关注起像动物一样学习的机器。然而，目前对比生物和人工系统学习能力的研究，大部分比较的是动物和机器接收不同的训练数据，这种对比掩盖了动物和机器的差异是否来自于学习机制的异同或训练数据的不同。本文提出了一种实验方法-“新生儿身体图灵测试”，允许新生动物和机器在相同的环境中接受相同的任务测试，直接比较它们的学习能力。为了构建这个平台，我们首先收集了新生小鸟的受控饲养数据，然后进行了“数字双胞胎”实验，让机器在模拟小鸟饲养条件下的虚拟环境中成长。我们发现，（1）机器（具有固有动机的深度强化学习代理）可以自发地发展视觉知识",
