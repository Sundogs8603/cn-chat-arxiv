    "translated_abstract": "零售销售和价格预测通常基于时间序列预测。对于某些产品类别，预测需求的准确性较低，会对库存、运输和补货计划造成负面影响。本文介绍了我们基于积极探索的试点演练的发现，以探索帮助零售商提高此类产品类别的预测准确性的方法。我们评估了通过一个样本产品类别“针织品”提高预测准确性的算法干预机会。目前，针织品产品类别的预测准确度在非AI模型中的范围为60%。我们探索了如何使用架构方法提高预测准确性。为了生成预测结果，我们的决策模型根据给定状态和上下文动态地从算法架中选择最佳算法。使用先进的特征工程构建的AI / ML预测模型的结果显示，需求预测的准确性有所提高。",
