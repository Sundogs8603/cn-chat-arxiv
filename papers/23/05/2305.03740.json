The use of demographic information in risk prediction is a traditional solution with applications in insurance planning, however, it is difficult to capture true driving behavior via such coarse-grained factors.

While most of the existing studies leverage demographic information in addition to telematics data, our objective is to maximize the use of telematics as well as contextual information (e.g., road-type) to build a risk prediction framework with real-world applications. We contextualize telematics data in a variety of forms, and then use it to develop a risk classifier, assuming that there are some weak risk labels available (e.g., past traffic citation records).

    "translated_abstract": "过去几十年，驾驶风险预测一直是研究的热点之一，旨在最小化驾驶风险并提高安全性。人口统计信息在风险预测中的利用是传统的解决方案，在保险规划中有应用，但是通过这样的粗粒度因素很难捕捉到真实的驾驶行为。因此，在过去十年中，遥感数据的使用已经得到广泛的应用。大多数现有的研究利用人口统计信息以及遥感数据，而我们的目标是最大限度地利用遥感数据以及情境信息（例如，道路类型）来构建具有实际应用的风险预测框架。我们将遥感数据情境化，并使用它们来开发一个风险分类器，假设有一些弱的风险标签可用（例如，过去的交通违章记录）。然而，在构建风险分类器之前，我们采用一种新颖的数据驱动过程来增强弱的风险标签而提高分类器的性能。",
