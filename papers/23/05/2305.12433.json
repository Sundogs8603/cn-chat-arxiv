    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度神经网络（DNN）广泛用于求解偏微分方程（PDE）。在这项工作中，提出了一种名为基于Particle Weak-form的神经网络（ParticleWNN）的新型深度学习框架，用于求解弱形式的PDE。在这个框架中，试验空间选择为DNN的空间，测试空间由紧密支持在极小区域内的函数构成，这些函数的中心是粒子。为了训练神经网络，设计了一种R自适应策略，以在训练期间自适应修改区域的半径。ParticleWNN继承了弱/变分公式的优点，例如要求较少的解的正则性和计算积分的少量积分点。此外，由于测试函数的特殊构造，ParticleWNN允许本地训练网络、并行实现和仅在极小区域内进行积分计算。该框架获得了较高的精度和效率，并在实现中具有良好的可扩展性和并行性。",
