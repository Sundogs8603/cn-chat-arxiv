    "translated_abstract": "传统参数化方法通过根据基础设计生成变化来限制对多样化设计的探索。相反，生成模型通过利用现有设计创建紧凑且多样化的生成设计空间（GDS）来提供解决方案。然而，当前的探索方法在复杂的GDS中的有效性，特别是在船体设计中，仍不清楚。为此，我们首先使用生成对抗网络构建了一个GDS，该网络使用各种类型船舶的52,591种设计进行了训练。接下来，我们构建了三种探索模式：随机探索（REM）、半自动探索（SAEM）和自动探索（AEM），其中用户的参与程度各不相同，以探索GDS并获取新颖且优化的设计。在REM中，用户基于直觉手动探索GDS。在SAEM中，用户和优化器均驱动探索。优化器专注于探索多样化的优化设计，而用户将探索重点放在其自己的设计偏好上。AEM使用优化器探索GDS以生成优化的设计。",
