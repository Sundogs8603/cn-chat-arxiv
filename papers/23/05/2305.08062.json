    "translated_abstract": "本文讨论了对于传统重要性加权方法方巨的大离散动作空间下的上下文匹配策略的离线策略评估（OPE）问题。为了解决方巨问题，我们提出了一个新的估计器OffCEM，该方法基于连词效应模型（CEM），这是一种新的因果效应分解方法，可以将效应分为群集效应和残差效应。OffCEM仅对行动群集应用重要性加权，通过基于模型的奖励估计来处理残余因果效应。我们表明，在新的本地正确性条件下，该估计器是无偏的，该条件仅要求残差效应模型保留每个群集中行动的相对期望奖励差异。为了充分利用CEM和本地正确性，我们还提出了一种新的两步过程，用于执行基于模型的估计，第一步最小化偏差，第二步最小化方差。我们发现，所得到的OPE估计器OffCEM在合成和实际大动作空间数据集上都明显优于现有的最先进方法。",

OffCEM applies importance weighting only to action clusters and addresses the residual causal effect through model-based reward estimation. The proposed estimator is unbiased under a new condition called local correctness. OffCEM significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets with large action spaces."
