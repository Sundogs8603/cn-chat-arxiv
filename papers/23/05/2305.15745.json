    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型所做决策的说明对于增加透明度和指导决策改进至关重要，这在图模型的情况下尤为明显，因为决策往往取决于结构和属性数据的综合模式。然而，现有工作主要集中在设计所谓的后序解释器上，相应的好的解释的标准仍然未知。我们提出了一种新的，灵活的鲁棒型前序解释器，名为RAGE（Robust Ante-hoc Graph Explainer），通过双层优化来发现一类广泛的图神经网络的解释，可以处理各种GNN架构和图形数据类型，并且具有足够信息，以启用人类预测复制。实验表明RAGE在几个数据集上具有发现忠实和鲁棒解释的效果。",

RAGE is robust to perturbations of the input graph and can handle various GNN architectures and graph data types. It satisfies the requirement of being informative enough to enable human prediction replication."
