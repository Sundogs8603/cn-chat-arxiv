    "translated_abstract": "切片Wasserstein流（SWF）是一种非参数生成建模的有前途的方法，但由于其发生生成质量的亚优性和缺乏条件建模能力而未被广泛采用。我们在这项工作中，为弥合这一差距做出了两个重要贡献。首先，基于一个愉悦的观察（在某些条件下），联合分布的SWF与条件分布的SWF相符，我们提出了条件切片Wasserstein流（CSWF），这是SWF的一个简单但有效的扩展，可实现非参数条件建模。其次，我们引入了适当的图像归纳偏置到SWF中，用两个技术受到视觉研究中的局部连接和多尺度表示的启发，大大提高了图像建模的效率和质量。通过全部改进，在进行纯非参数建模的同时，在有条件和无条件任务上实现了与许多深度参数化生成模型相当的生成性能。",
