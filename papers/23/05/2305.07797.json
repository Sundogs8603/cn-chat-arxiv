    "abstract": "Commonsense reasoning is omnipresent in human communications and thus is an important feature for open-domain dialogue systems. However, evaluating commonsense in dialogue systems is still an open challenge. We take the first step by focusing on event commonsense that considers events and their relations, and is crucial in both dialogues and general commonsense reasoning. We propose ACCENT, an event commonsense evaluation metric empowered by commonsense knowledge bases (CSKBs). ACCENT first extracts event-relation tuples from a dialogue, and then evaluates the response by scoring the tuples in terms of their compatibility with the CSKB. To evaluate ACCENT, we construct the first public event commonsense evaluation dataset for open-domain dialogues. Our experiments show that ACCENT is an efficient metric for event commonsense evaluation, which achieves higher correlations with human judgments than existing baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "常识推理在人类交流中普遍存在，因此对于开放领域的对话系统来说是一个重要特征。但是，评估对话系统中的常识推理仍然是一个挑战。我们首先关注事件常识，它考虑事件及其关系，在对话和一般常识推理中至关重要。我们提出ACCENT，一种受常识知识库 (CSKBs) 授权的事件常识评价指标。ACCENT首先从对话中提取事件-关系元组，然后通过计算它们与CSKB的兼容性来评估响应。为了评估ACCENT，我们构建了第一个面向开放域对话的事件常识评价数据集。我们的实验结果表明，ACCENT是一种有效的事件常识评估指标，比现有基线模型更能与人类判断相关联。",
