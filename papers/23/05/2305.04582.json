    "translated_abstract": "关系抽取是信息提取中的一个基本任务，其在多语言环境下的扩展受到缺乏与TACRED（Zhang等人，2017）等大型英语数据集相媲美的监督资源的限制。为填补这一空白，我们介绍MultiTACRED数据集，涵盖来自9个语系的12种语言。该数据集是通过机器翻译TACRED实例和自动投影其实体注释而创建的。我们分析了翻译和注释投影的质量，确定了错误类别，并在常见的迁移学习场景中实验评估了微调预训练的单语和多语言语言模型的性能。我们的分析表明，机器翻译是传递RE实例的可行策略，母语人士判断超过83％的翻译实例在语言和语义上都是可接受的。我们发现单语RE模型的性能与英文原版相当。",
