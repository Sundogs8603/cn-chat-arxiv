    "abstract": "Metaphor detection (MD) suffers from limited training data. In this paper, we started with a linguistic rule called Metaphor Identification Procedure and then proposed a novel multi-task learning framework to transfer knowledge in basic sense discrimination (BSD) to MD. BSD is constructed from word sense disambiguation (WSD), which has copious amounts of data. We leverage adversarial training to align the data distributions of MD and BSD in the same feature space, so task-invariant representations can be learned. To capture fine-grained alignment patterns, we utilize the multi-mode structures of MD and BSD. Our method is totally end-to-end and can mitigate the data scarcity problem in MD. Competitive results are reported on four public datasets. Our code and datasets are available.",

    "translated_abstract": "隐喻检测（MD）受限于有限的训练数据。本文从一个称为隐喻识别程序的语言规则开始，然后提出了一个新颖的多任务学习框架，将基本意义鉴别（BSD）的知识转移到MD中。BSD建立在词义消歧（WSD）的基础上，后者拥有丰富的数据。我们利用对抗性训练将MD和BSD在相同的特征空间中的数据分布对齐，从而可以学习到任务不变表示。为了捕捉精细的对齐模式，我们利用了MD和BSD的多模态结构。我们的方法完全端到端，可以缓解MD中的数据稀缺问题。我们在四个公共数据集上报告了具有竞争力的结果。我们的代码和数据集是可用的。",
