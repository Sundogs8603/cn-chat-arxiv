    "translated_abstract": "超音速自激振荡是由激波和分离边界层相互作用引起的流动不稳定现象。这种流动现象在飞行中被认为是极具破坏性的，并对飞行器的结构强度和疲劳寿命构成重大风险。到现在为止，还缺乏一种准确、高效和直观的度量方法来预测自激振荡，并对空气动力设计实施可行的限制。本文提出了一种物理辅助的变分自编码器（PAVAE）来识别超音速自激振荡的主要特征，将无监督的降阶建模与通过振荡分类器嵌入的额外物理信息相结合。具体地，训练了四个模型，分别调整分类器贡献的权重，以调查振荡信息对潜在空间的影响。统计结果表明，当对分类器应用适当的权重时，只需一个潜在空间即可精确确定振荡状态。",
