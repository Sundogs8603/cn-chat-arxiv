    "translated_abstract": "近年来，随着深度学习技术的发展，音乐信息检索(MIR)得到了爆炸性的发展。然而，诸如电子舞曲等音乐类型相对于其他类型一直较少研究。考虑到其广泛的应用，我们提出了一种Python软件包，用于自动化EDM音频生成，并作为EDM歌曲MIR的基础设施，以缓解获取标注数据的难度。它是一个方便的工具，可以轻松连接到许多符号音乐生成管道的末端。在这个软件包中，我们提供了一个框架来构建专业水平的模板，可以从指定的旋律和和弦中呈现出一个制作精良的轨道，或者仅通过我们的概率符号旋律生成器，提供具有各种风格的音轨。实验证明，我们的混音在主观和客观评估方面与由世界著名艺术家制作的原始参考歌曲具有相同的质量。",

    "en_tdlr": "LooPy is a Python package that provides an infrastructure for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) on electronic dance music (EDM) by offering automated EDM audio generation, professional-level template building, and probabilistic symbolic melody generation, and it has been proven to achieve the same quality as reference songs produced by well-known artists in both subjective and objective evaluations."
