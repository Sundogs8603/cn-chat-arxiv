    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶在汽车工业中受到广泛关注，通常被视为交通运输业的未来发展方向。基于端到端机器学习技术的快速发展，自动驾驶技术的发展已经得到很大加速，并被成功应用于感知、规划和控制任务中。自动驾驶规划的一个重要方面是了解环境在不久的将来会如何演变并采取适当的行动。为了保持情境感知，自动驾驶系统应有效地利用从各种传感器收集的信息来形成世界的抽象表示。为此，可以使用深度学习模型从传入数据流中学习紧凑的潜在表示。然而，大多数深度学习模型都是端到端训练的，并不在体系结构中融合任何先前知识（例如物理知识）。在这方面，许多工作探索将领域特定知识集成到深度学习模型中以获得更好的准确性和鲁棒性。本文提出了Kalman滤波增强的循环神经网络（KARNet），将Kalman滤波器，一种广泛用于控制系统中的方法，集成到循环神经网络中，用于学习自动驾驶任务的世界模型。KARNet可以有效地利用行驶工具的先前知识来提高预测环境未来状态的准确性和效率。在基准自动驾驶数据集上进行的实验结果表明，KARNet优于现有的最先进方法，并在预测精度和计算效率之间取得了更好的平衡。",
