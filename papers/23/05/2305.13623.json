    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体平台，如Facebook和TikTok的指数级增长，已经改变了人类社会的交流和内容发布方式。在这些平台上，用户可以发布结合文本，音频，图像和视频传递信息的多媒体内容。与此同时，多媒体内容发布设施日益被利用来传播有害内容，如仇恨言论，恶意广告和色情内容。为此，内容审核软件已经广泛部署在这些平台上，以检测和屏蔽有害内容。然而，由于内容审核模型的复杂性以及跨多种模式理解信息的困难，现有的内容审核软件可能会失败，导致极为负面的影响。我们引入Semantic Fusion，这是一种通用而有效的验证多媒体内容审核软件的方法。我们的关键思想是融合两个或更多基于不同模态（如文本，音频，图像和视频）的现有内容审核模型，并利用多模态的互补性和一致性来提高内容审核软件的验证性能。我们在一个大规模的多媒体内容审核数据集上评估了Semantic Fusion，并显示它相比现有方法显著提高了验证结果。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种名为“Semantic Fusion”的通用有效方法，通过融合两个或多个不同模态的内容审核模型来提高多媒体内容审核软件的验证效果。该方法经过大规模多媒体内容审核数据集的评估，相比现有方法显著提高了验证结果。",
    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a general and effective method named \"Semantic Fusion\" to improve the validation performance of multimedia content moderation software by fusing two or more existing content moderation models based on different modalities. The method significantly improves the validation results compared to existing approaches, as evaluated on a large-scale multimedia content moderation dataset."
