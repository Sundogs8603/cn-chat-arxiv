    "translated_abstract": "手术治疗复杂的膝关节骨折通过使用移动C臂进行实时成像来指导。通过与患者定位相对的特定C臂姿势相对应的2D解剖特异性标准视图实现即时和连续的控制，目前通过试错方法手动确定，需要耗费时间和辐射剂量。膝关节标准视图的特征表明，个人骨骼的形状信息可以指导自动定位过程，减少C臂定位期间的时间和不必要的辐射。为了完全自动化膝关节手术中的C臂定位任务，我们提出了一个完整的框架，它实现了（1）自动区分左右和标准视图和（2）基于单个初始X射线的基于形状的姿态回归到所需的标准视图。提出了一个合适的形状表示来将语义信息合并到姿态回归中。实验结果表明，我们的框架在精度和鲁棒性方面优于现有技术。",
