    "translated_abstract": "多任务学习具有通过最大化任务间正向转移来提高泛化能力、减少任务干扰的潜力。然而，手动设计的网络架构在整个训练过程中保持静态，这限制了其发挥潜力。相比之下，大脑中的学习是通过结构性变化和突触强度变化相互作用实现的。因此，我们提出了“多任务结构学习（MTSL）”，它可以同时学习多任务架构及其参数。MTSL从每个任务的相同单任务网络开始，交替进行任务学习和结构学习。在任务学习阶段，每个网络专门处理相应的任务。在每个结构学习阶段中，从最早的层开始，局部相似的任务层首先将其知识传输到新创建的组层，然后再将其删除。然后MTSL在相应的组层中使用它们。",
