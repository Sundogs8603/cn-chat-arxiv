    "translated_abstract": "机器学习算法有望改善数字病理学中的患者结果，但是这些工具的泛化性能目前受到组织样本制备、染色程序和扫描设备差异的敏感性限制，这些差异会导致数字切片中的域漂移。为了克服这个限制并提高模型的泛化性能，我们研究了两种合成 DOmain-Targeted Augmentation (S-DOTA) 方法——CycleGAN-enabled Scanner Transform (ST) 和 targeted Stain Vector Augmentation (SVA)的有效性，并将它们与国际色彩委员会 (ICC) 基于配置文件的颜色校准 (ICC Cal) 方法和使用传统亮度、颜色和噪声增强的基线方法进行了比较。我们评估了这些技术提高模型对各种任务和设置的泛化能力的能力：包括四个模型、两种模型类型(组织分割和细胞分类)、两种损失函数、六个实验室、六个扫描仪和三个指标(肝病、结肠癌和直肠癌)。",
