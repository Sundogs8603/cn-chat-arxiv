    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）展示了卓越的语言能力。基于高级LLM的GPT-4表现出超常的多模态能力，超越了以往的视觉语言模型。我们将这归功于与以前的多模态模型相比使用了更先进的LLM。但不幸的是，GPT-4的模型架构和训练策略是未知的。为了赋予LLM多模态能力，我们提出了X-LLM，通过使用X2L接口将多模态（图像、语音、视频）转换为外语并将其输入到大型语言模型（ChatGLM）中。具体而言，X-LLM使用X2L接口将多个冻结的单模态编码器和冻结的LLM对齐，其中“X”表示多模态，例如图像、语音和视频，“L”表示语言。X-LLM的训练由三个阶段组成：（1）转换多模态信息：第一阶段分别训练每个X2L接口与其各自的单模态编码器对齐，将多模态信息转换为外语输入到ChatGLM中。...",
