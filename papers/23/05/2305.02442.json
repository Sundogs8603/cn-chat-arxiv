    "translated_abstract": "最小陷阱空间(MTSs)捕捉布尔动态被困的子空间，无论更新模式如何，它们都对应于最让人满意的模式的吸引子。由于其多功能性，近年来计算MTSs已经引起了人们的关注，主要是通过重点关注其枚举来实现的。在本文中，我们讨论了MTS的通用属性的逻辑推理，并解决了两个问题：用于识别在所有MTSs上执行给定属性的布尔变量的永久冻结的重编程问题，并从其MTSs的通用属性合成布尔网络。这两个问题都归结为解决具有3个量化器($\\exists\\forall\\exists$)的命题逻辑公式的可满足性。在本文中，我们引入了一个记数器示例引导的精炼抽象(CEGAR)来通过耦合解决两个更简单的公式来有效地解决这些问题。我们提供了一个原型，依赖于答案集编程来说明我们的方法的有效性。",
