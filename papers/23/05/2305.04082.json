    "translated_abstract": "文本游戏是基于自然语言的强化学习交互环境。虽然语言模型和知识图谱通常被用于处理文本游戏中的大量动作空间，但目前仍不确定这些技术是否必要或被过度使用。本文重新思考了在文本游戏中探索动作空间的挑战，并提出了 ε-可接受的探索方法，这是一种利用可接受的动作的最小化方法进行训练。此外，我们提出了一种文本角色-评论（TAC）代理，该代理仅从游戏观察中生成文本命令，而无需任何语言模型或知识图谱。在 Jericho 的 10 种游戏中，我们的方法的表现优于强基线和使用语言模型和知识图谱的最先进代理。我们的方法凸显出，对于有效地探索指数级动作空间，更轻量化的模型设计和利用环境信息的新视角是足够的。",

The proposed text-based actor-critic (TAC) agent performs well on 10 games from Jericho dataset compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The approach highlights that a lighter model design and a fresh perspective on utilizing the information within the environments suffice for an effective exploration of exponentially large action spaces."
