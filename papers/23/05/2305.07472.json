This paper proposes a generalized model of implementation that does not assume rational expectations and characterizes the class of solution concepts requiring Bayesian Incentive Compatibility for full implementation. Surprisingly, full implementation of social choice functions turns out not to be significantly more permissive than with rational expectations. This implies some classical results, such as the impossibility of efficient bilateral trade (Myerson and Satterthwaite, 1983) hold for a broad range of non-equilibrium solution concepts, confirming their relevance even in boundedly rational setups.",
