    "abstract": "Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) has expanded our ability to visualize subcellular structures but is limited in its temporal resolution. Increasing emitter density will improve temporal resolution, but current analysis algorithms struggle as emitter images significantly overlap. Here we present a deep convolutional neural network called LUENN which utilizes a unique architecture that rejects the isolated emitter assumption; it can smoothly accommodate emitters that range from completely isolated to co-located. This architecture, alongside an accurate estimator of location uncertainty, extends the range of usable emitter densities by a factor of 6 to over 31 emitters per micrometer-squared with reduced penalty to localization precision and improved temporal resolution. Apart from providing uncertainty estimation, the algorithm improves usability in laboratories by reducing imaging times and easing requirements for successful experiments.",

    "translated_abstract": "单分子定位显微术（SMLM）扩展了我们观察亚细胞结构的能力，但在时间分辨率上受到限制。 增加发射器密度将改善时间分辨率，但当前的分析算法在发射器图像重叠显著时遇到困难。 我们提出了一种名为LUENN的深度卷积神经网络，它利用了一个独特的架构，拒绝了孤立发射器的假设； 它可以平滑地容纳从完全孤立到共聚的发射器。 除了提供不确定性估计外，这种架构还提高了实验室的可用性，缩短了成像时间并放宽了实验的要求。它将半径为1微米平方内可用的发射器密度的范围扩大了6倍以上，从而降低了定位精度的惩罚，并提高了时间分辨率。",
