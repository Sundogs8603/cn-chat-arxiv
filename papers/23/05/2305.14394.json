    "translated_abstract": "本研究利用脉冲神经网络（SNN）构建了前额叶皮层（PFC）的计算模型，以了解神经元在短时和长时的刺激变化下如何适应和响应任务切换。我们还通过在我们的脉冲体系结构模型中模拟受损状态来探讨 PFC 损伤所引起的行为缺陷。尽管已经存在一些 PFC 的计算模型，但还没有使用 SNN 来建模它们。本研究使用参数接近生物学可行值的 SNN 进行训练，使用无监督的脉冲时序依赖性塑性（STDP）学习规则进行模型训练。我们的模型基于联结主义架构，展现了持久活动等神经现象，有助于产生短期或工作记忆。我们利用这些特点通过关闭突触通路来模拟损伤，并记录学习模式的权重调整和在这种情况下学习任务的准确性。",

The model was trained using unsupervised spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule and exhibited neural phenomena like sustained activity. By simulating lesioned states and weight adjustments of learned patterns, the study provides new insights for studying neural adaptation and learning."
