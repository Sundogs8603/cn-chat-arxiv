    "translated_abstract": "尽管自动对话辅导工具在个性化和提高教育可及性方面具有巨大潜力，但由于缺乏足够大规模且高质量的数据集，这类系统的研究一直受到阻碍。然而，收集此类数据集仍然具有挑战性，因为录制辅导会引发隐私问题，而众包则会导致数据质量不足。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个框架，通过将真正的老师与大型语言模型(LLM)配对，构建常见学生错误的支架，来半合成地生成这些对话。在本文中，我们描述了使用这个框架来收集MathDial的最新工作，这是一个当前拥有约1.5k个基于多步数学词问题的辅导对话数据集。我们展示了我们的数据集展现出丰富的教育性属性，主要关注通过引导学生使用问题来探索问题。此外，我们概述了MathDial及其地面注释可用于微调...",
