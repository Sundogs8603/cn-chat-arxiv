    "translated_abstract": "在他的开创性论文《计算机器械与智能》中，艾伦·图灵引入了“模仿游戏”，探讨了机器智能的概念。图灵测试自那时以来一直是广泛讨论、完善和扩展的主题。本文回避了关于某个特定机器是否能被标记为智能或能否在给定环境中匹配人类能力的问题。与此相反，但受图灵启发，我们关注在日常生活中确定是否正在与一个人或一个机器进行交互这个看似简单的挑战。我们对这个人还是机器问题及其可靠答案的应用感到感兴趣，并希望反思其重要性。虽然图灵的原始测试被广泛认为是一种思维实验，但本文讨论的人还是机器问题具有明显的实际意义。虽然人类是否能够创造出能够胜任所有的人类工作的机器也未可知。",
    "tldr": "本文基于图灵测试，回避了机器是否智能的问题，探讨在日常生活中如何确定一个交互对象是人还是机器的挑战，并思考了其应用和重要性。"
