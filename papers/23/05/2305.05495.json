    "translated_abstract": "物联网数据是成功的农业数字化转型的核心要素，但物联网数据也带来了很多挑战，比如数据污染风险。当传感器提供持续不正确的测量值时，称为异常数据。为确保正确的分析结果，与IoT数据一起工作时必需的预处理步骤是检测这些异常传感器。现有的方法假定已知良好的传感器或者大多数传感器都是良好的，但真实世界的数据往往是完全没有标记的并且数量庞大，需要能够在没有先前信息的情况下检测到异常传感器的自我监督方法。我们提出了一种基于具有对比损失的神经网络和DBSCAN的自我监督型异常传感器检测器。我们的论文的一个核心贡献是在三元组损失的负采样中使用动态时间规整。我们基于合成数据和真实世界的土壤湿度数据进行了实验，结果表明我们的方法可以准确地区分良好和异常的传感器，甚至在没有标记训练数据的情况下也能做到。",
