    "abstract": "We present SPECTRON, a novel approach to adapting pre-trained language models (LMs) to perform speech continuation. By leveraging pre-trained speech encoders, our model generates both text and speech outputs with the entire system being trained end-to-end operating directly on spectrograms. Training the entire model in the spectrogram domain simplifies our speech continuation system versus existing cascade methods which use discrete speech representations. We further show our method surpasses existing spoken language models both in semantic content and speaker preservation while also benefiting from the knowledge transferred from pre-existing models.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了SPECTRON，一种新颖的方法来适应预训练的语言模型（LM）以执行语音延续。通过利用预训练的语音编码器，我们的模型可以生成文本和语音输出，整个系统都在频谱图上进行端到端的训练。在频谱图领域训练整个模型相对于使用离散语音表示的现有级联方法简化了我们的语音延续系统。我们进一步展示了我们的方法在语义内容和讲话者保护方面超过了现有的口语语言模型，同时也从预先存在的模型中获得了知识传递的好处。我们的网站https://michelleramanovich.github.io/spectron/spectron上可以找到音频样本。",
