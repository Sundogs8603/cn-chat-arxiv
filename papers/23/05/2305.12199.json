The dataset, which covers nine subjects, was generated from the Vietnamese National High School Graduation Examination and comparable tests. 300 literary essays have been included, and there are over 19,000 multiple-choice questions on a range of topics. The dataset assesses LLMs in multitasking situations such as question answering, text generation, reading comprehension, visual question answering, and more by including both textual data and accompanying images. Using ChatGPT and BingChat, we evaluated LLMs on the VNHSGE dataset and contrasted their performance with that of Vietnamese students to see how well they performed. The results show that ChatGPT and BingChat both perform at a human level in a number of areas, including literature, English, history, geography, and civics education.

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了专门用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的越南高中毕业考试（VNHSGE）数据集。该数据集涵盖了九个学科，包括从越南国家高中毕业考试和可比测试中提取的300篇文学文章，以及超过19,000道各类主题的多项选择题。数据集通过包含文字数据和相应的图片，对LLMs在多任务情况下进行了评估，例如问题回答、文本生成、阅读理解、视觉问答等。我们使用ChatGPT和BingChat对VNHSGE数据集中的LLMs进行了评估，并将它们的表现与越南学生的表现进行了对比，结果显示，ChatGPT和BingChat在文学、英语、历史、地理、公民教育等多个领域表现均达到了人类水平，但它们仍有提升的空间。",
