    "abstract": "The introduction of OpenAI's large language model, ChatGPT, catalyzed investor attention towards artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, including AI-related crypto assets not directly related to ChatGPT. Utilizing the synthetic difference-in-difference methodology, we identify significant 'ChatGPT effects' with returns of AI-related crypto assets experiencing average returns ranging between 10.7% and 15.6% (35.5% to 41.3%) in the one-month (two-month) period after the ChatGPT launch. Furthermore, Google search volumes, a proxy for attention to AI, emerged as critical pricing indicators for AI-related crypto post-launch. We conclude that investors perceived AI-assets as possessing heightened potential or value after the launch, resulting in higher market valuations.",

    "translated_abstract": "OpenAI的大型语言模型ChatGPT的推出，激发了投资者对人工智能技术的关注，包括与ChatGPT无直接关系的人工智能相关加密资产。利用合成差异分析方法，我们发现了显著的“ChatGPT效应”，AI相关加密资产的回报率在ChatGPT推出后一个月（两个月）期间经历了10.7％至15.6％（35.5％至41.3％）的平均回报。此外，谷歌搜索量作为人工智能关注度的代理指标，成为ChatGPT推出后其加密资产定价的重要指标。我们得出结论，投资者认为在推出ChatGPT后，人工智能资产具有更高的潜力或价值，从而导致了更高的市场估值。",
