    "abstract": "This article presents a simple but effective approach to improve the accuracy of Least-Squares Monte Carlo for American-style options. The key idea is to construct the ansatz of conditional expected continuation payoff using the exact solution from low dimensional finite difference methods, to be used in linear regression. This approach builds a bridge between solving backward partial differential equations and a Monte Carlo simulation, aiming at achieving the best of both worlds. We illustrate the technique with realistic examples including Bermuda options and worst of issuer callable notes. The method can be considered as a generic numerical scheme across various asset classes, in particular, as an accurate method for pricing American-style derivatives under arbitrary dimensions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种简单而有效的方法，以提高在美式期权定价中最小二乘蒙特卡罗方法的精确性。关键思想是使用低维有限差分法的精确解来构建条件期望继续支付的假设，用于线性回归。该方法在解决向后偏微分方程和蒙特卡罗模拟方面建立了桥梁，旨在实现两者的最佳结合。我们通过实际示例说明该技术，包括百慕大期权和最差发行人可赎回票据。该方法可被视为跨越各种资产类别的通用数值方案，特别是在任意维度下，作为定价美式衍生产品的准确方法。",
