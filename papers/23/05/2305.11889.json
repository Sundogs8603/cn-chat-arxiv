    "translated_abstract": "如今，人们在生活的各个方面都使用电力，因此电力消耗逐渐增加。由于人为疏忽、日光等各种原因，电力可能会浪费。因此，节约能源是当务之急。本文介绍了一种“自动化节能系统（APCS）”的制作，具有多种好处，如节省电力消耗，从而节省组织的电费，消除人为干预和手动开关灯和电气装置所需的人力，最重要的是通过减少电气能耗来节约宝贵的自然资源。该项目使用了两个IR传感器，用于检测教室中人员的存在。当APCS检测到有人存在时，它会自动打开教室中的风扇和灯，在人离开时自动关闭。该系统通过智能手机应用程序进行控制和监控，方便用户随时访问系统。由于易于实施和维护，APCS已被证明是高效和具有成本效益的。",
