    "translated_abstract": "在增强机器学习公平性方面，越来越多的关注点涌现出来。尽管有越来越多的提升公平性的方法，但我们对应用这些方法时，在考虑因素之间的权衡缺乏系统性的理解。这种理解对于开发者做出关于提供公平机器学习服务的明智决策至关重要。然而，当存在多个公平性参数和其他关键指标，并且彼此之间存在耦合甚至冲突时，分析这些权衡是极其困难的。本文提出使用因果分析作为一种原则性方法，在机器学习流程中分析公平性参数与其他关键指标之间的权衡。为了实际有效地进行因果分析，我们提出了一组领域特定的优化方法，以促进准确的因果发现，并基于成熟的因果推断提出了一个统一的、新颖的权衡分析接口。",
