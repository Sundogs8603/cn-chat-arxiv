    "translated_abstract": "生成式 AI 模型，如 DALL-E 2，能够解释文本提示并生成展现人类创造力的高质量图像。尽管公众热情高涨，但对 AI 生成图像中潜在性别偏见的系统审查仍然很少。我们通过检查覆盖 153 个职业的 15,300 张 DALL-E 2 图像中两种职业性别偏见（代表性偏见和展示性偏见）的普遍性，并根据2021年人口普查劳动力统计数据和 Google 图像进行基准测试，来解决此问题。我们的发现揭示了 DALL-E 2 在男性主导领域中低估女性，在女性主导职业中高估女性。此外，DALL-E 2 的图像倾向于描绘更多带有微笑和向下看的女性而不是男性，特别是在女性主导的职业中。我们的计算算法审查研究展示了 DALL-E 2 中更明显的代表性和展示性偏见。",
