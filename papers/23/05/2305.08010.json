    "translated_abstract": "目前的虚拟心理健康助手（VMHA）提供辅导和建议护理。它们不进行患者诊断协助，因为它们缺乏安全受限和专业临床流程知识的培训。 在这项工作中，我们定义Proknow为一组有序信息，它映射到领域专家的基于证据的指南或概念理解类别。我们还介绍了一种由安全限制和Proknow引导的诊断对话的新数据集，这是医疗保健专业人员使用的。我们开发了一种自然语言问题生成（NLG）方法，可以与患者交互收集诊断信息。我们证明了在此数据集上使用最先进的大规模语言模型（LM）的局限性。我们的算法通过明确地建模安全性，知识捕获和可解释性来模拟流程知识。使用ProKnow引导的LM增强方法在抑郁症和焦虑症中生成了89％更安全的问题。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了ProKnow的概念，它可以提高虚拟心理健康助手的安全性和专业性。同时开发了自然语言问题生成算法，通过明确建模安全性、知识捕获和可解释性来模拟流程知识。在抑郁症和焦虑症中的实验表明，使用ProKnow引导的算法可以生成更安全的问题。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes the concept of ProKnow to improve the safety and professionalism of virtual mental health assistants. A natural language question generation algorithm is developed, which simulates process knowledge by explicitly modeling safety, knowledge capture, and explainability. Experimental results in depression and anxiety show that the algorithm guided by ProKnow can generate safer questions."
