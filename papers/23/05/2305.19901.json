    "translated_abstract": "符合回归提供了具有全局覆盖保证的预测区间，但往往无法捕获局部误差分布，导致不均匀覆盖。我们提出了一种新的自适应方法，它基于用局部分数分布的估计来重新缩放符合分数，灵感来自Jackknife+方法，它使得在不破坏校准-测试交换性的情况下可以利用校准数据的符合分数。我们的方法确保了正式的全局覆盖保证，并得到了关于局部覆盖的新理论结果，包括任何校准分数的后验界限。我们的方法的优势在于实现了局部覆盖，而不牺牲校准集大小，提高了符合预测间隔在各种设置中的适用性。因此，我们的方法提供了优于先前方法的预测区间，特别是在低数据范围内，使其在实际应用中尤为相关。",
