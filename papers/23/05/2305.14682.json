    "abstract": "Hybrid Question-Answering (HQA), which targets reasoning over tables and passages linked from table cells, has witnessed significant research in recent years. A common challenge in HQA and other passage-table QA datasets is that it is generally unrealistic to iterate over all table rows, columns, and linked passages to retrieve evidence. Such a challenge made it difficult for previous studies to show their reasoning ability in retrieving answers. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Table-alignment-based Cell-selection and Reasoning model (TACR) for hybrid text and table QA, evaluated on the HybridQA and WikiTableQuestions datasets. In evidence retrieval, we design a table-question-alignment enhanced cell-selection method to retrieve fine-grained evidence. In answer reasoning, we incorporate a QA module that treats the row containing selected cells as context. Experimental results over the HybridQA and WikiTableQuestions (WTQ) datasets show that TACR achieves state-of-the-art results",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，针对表格和与表格单元链接的段落进行推理的混合问答（HQA）已经得到了显着的研究。在HQA和其他段落-表格QA数据集中，一个常见的挑战是通常不可能遍历所有表格行、列和链接的段落来检索证据。这使得以前的研究很难展示其在检索答案时的推理能力。为了弥合这一差距，我们提出了一种新的基于表格对齐的单元选择和推理模型（TACR）用于混合文本和表格QA，并在HybridQA和WikiTableQuestions数据集上进行了评估。在证据检索中，我们设计了一种表格-问题对齐增强的单元选择方法来检索细粒度证据。在回答推理中，我们将包含选定单元的行作为上下文，加入一个QA模块。在HybridQA和WikiTableQuestions（WTQ）数据集上的实验结果表明，TACR取得了最先进的结果。",
