    "translated_abstract": "Transformer 由于其学习长距离依赖性的能力已经克服了卷积神经网络（CNN）全局透视学习的缺点。因此，它们已经成为研究人员关注的焦点，用于多个与视觉相关的任务，包括医疗诊断。然而，它们的多头注意模块仅捕获全局级别的特征表示，这对于医学图像来说是不足的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种 Channel Boosted Hybrid Vision Transformer（CB HVT），它利用迁移学习生成增强通道，并使用 Transformers 和 CNN 来分析组织病理学图像中的淋巴细胞。所提出的 CB HVT 包括五个模块，包括通道生成模块、通道利用模块、通道合并模块、区域感知模块和检测和分段头，它们共同有效地识别淋巴细胞。通道生成模块使用通过迁移学习进行通道增强的思想创建多个强大的通道，然后与 Transformers 和 CNN 结合使用，以更好地分析组织病理学图像中的淋巴细胞。总体而言，所提出的 CB HVT 是医学诊断中准确、高效评估淋巴细胞的强大工具。",
