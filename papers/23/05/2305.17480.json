    "translated_abstract": "夸张和隐喻在日常交流中很常见（例如，“我陷入了麻烦之中”：麻烦怎么可能有深度？），因此它们的检测尤为重要，特别是在对话 AI 设置中。现有的自动检测夸张和隐喻的方法独立地研究了这些语言现象，但它们之间的关系从未被计算化探索过。在本文中，我们提出了一个多任务深度学习框架，同时检测夸张和隐喻。我们假设隐喻有助于夸张检测，反之亦然。为验证这一假设，我们使用隐喻标签注释了两个夸张数据集-HYPO 和 HYPO-L-。同时，我们使用夸张标签注释了两个隐喻数据集-TroFi 和 LCC。使用这些数据集的实验证明，我们的方法比先前的夸张检测方法进步了 12%。此外，我们的多任务学习方法相对于单任务学习方法提高了多达 17%。",
