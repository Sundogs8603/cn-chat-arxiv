    "abstract": "Compared to news and chat summarization, the development of meeting summarization is hugely decelerated by the limited data. To this end, we introduce a versatile Chinese meeting summarization dataset, dubbed VCSum, consisting of 239 real-life meetings, with a total duration of over 230 hours. We claim our dataset is versatile because we provide the annotations of topic segmentation, headlines, segmentation summaries, overall meeting summaries, and salient sentences for each meeting transcript. As such, the dataset can adapt to various summarization tasks or methods, including segmentation-based summarization, multi-granularity summarization and retrieval-then-generate summarization. Our analysis confirms the effectiveness and robustness of VCSum. We also provide a set of benchmark models regarding different downstream summarization tasks on VCSum to facilitate further research. The dataset and code will be released at \\url{https://github.com/hahahawu/VCSum}.",

    "translated_abstract": "与新闻和聊天摘要相比，由于数据受限，会议摘要的发展受到极大的减速。为此，我们介绍了一个多功能的中文会议摘要数据集VCSum，包括239个现实生活中的会议，总时长超过230小时。我们声称我们的数据集是多功能的，因为我们为每个会议的文本提供了主题划分、头条、分段摘要、整个会议摘要和显要句子等注释。因此，该数据集可以适应各种摘要任务或方法，包括基于分割的摘要、多粒度摘要和检索-生成摘要。我们的分析证实了VCSum的有效性和稳健性。我们还提供了一组关于不同下游摘要任务的基准模型，以便进一步研究VCSum。数据集和代码将在 \\url{https://github.com/hahahawu/VCSum} 上发布。",
