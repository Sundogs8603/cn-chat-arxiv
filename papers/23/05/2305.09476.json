    "abstract": "The ongoing penetration of energy systems with information and communications technology (ICT) and the introduction of new markets increase the potential for malicious or profit-driven attacks that endanger system stability. To ensure security-of-supply, it is necessary to analyze such attacks and their underlying vulnerabilities, to develop countermeasures and improve system design. We propose ANALYSE, a machine-learning-based software suite to let learning agents autonomously find attacks in cyber-physical energy systems, consisting of the power system, ICT, and energy markets. ANALYSE is a modular, configurable, and self-documenting framework designed to find yet unknown attack types and to reproduce many known attack strategies in cyber-physical energy systems from the scientific literature.",

    "translated_abstract": "信息通信技术的普及和市场的引入使得恶意攻击和以利益为驱动的攻击对物理网络能源系统造成了威胁。为确保供应安全，有必要分析这些攻击及其潜在漏洞，制定对策并改进系统设计。我们提出了基于机器学习的软件套件ANALYSE，让学习代理能够自主地在包括电力系统、信息通信技术和能源市场在内的物理网络能源系统中发现攻击。ANALYSE 是一个模块化、可配置和自我记录的框架，旨在找到尚未知道的攻击类型，并在从科学文献中复现许多已知的攻击策略。",
