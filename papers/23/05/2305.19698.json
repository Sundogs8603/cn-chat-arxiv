    "translated_abstract": "最近，建模密度分布的新方法——神经密度场，可以准确地描述天体的密度分布，而无需进行形状建模，这在近距离设计轨迹时具有极大的优势。本文探讨了神经密度场及其相对误差在外部因素（如噪声或约束条件）下的鲁棒性，例如某些距离下的最大可用重力信号强度所示的433 Eros和67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko。结果发现，训练在多面体和mascon基础上的模型表现相似，这表明基础事实并不是准确性的瓶颈。典型探测任务中太阳辐射压的影响可以忽略不计，相对误差与无噪声相当。然而，限制探针精度的影响会对模型造成影响。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了神经密度场的鲁棒性，发现其相对误差受外部因素影响较小，且训练基础事实并非准确性的瓶颈。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the robustness of neural density fields and finds that their relative errors are minimally affected by external factors. The study also suggests that ground truth accuracy is not the bottleneck for accuracy and precision limitations of probes can have an impact on model performance."
