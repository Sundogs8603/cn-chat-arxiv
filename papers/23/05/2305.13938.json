    "abstract": "Concerns regarding unfairness and discrimination in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) systems have recently received increased attention from both legal and computer science scholars. Yet, the degree of overlap between notions of algorithmic bias and fairness on the one hand, and legal notions of discrimination and equality on the other, is often unclear, leading to misunderstandings between computer science and law. What types of bias and unfairness does the law address when it prohibits discrimination? What role can fairness metrics play in establishing legal compliance? In this paper, we aim to illustrate to what extent European Union (EU) non-discrimination law coincides with notions of algorithmic fairness proposed in computer science literature and where they differ.

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能系统中美感到不公平和歧视的问题最近引起了法律和计算机科学学者的越来越多的关注。然而，算法偏见和公平性以及法律上的歧视和平等概念之间的重叠程度通常不清楚，导致计算机科学和法律之间的误解。本文旨在阐明欧盟非歧视法与计算机科学文献中提出的算法公平性概念在多大程度上重合以及它们的区别。本文的贡献如下：首先，我们通过欧盟案例法的角度来分析算法不公平的典型例子，找出与欧盟案例法的类比之处。其次，我们建立了一个框架，以帮助决策者确定算法和AI系统的公平性指标，以确保它们符合欧盟的非歧视法理。",
