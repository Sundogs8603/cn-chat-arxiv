    "translated_abstract": "现实世界中的事实验证任务旨在通过从原始文档中检索证据来验证声明的事实性。 检索到的证据的质量在该任务中起着重要作用。 理想情况下，检索到的证据应该是可信的（反映了模型在声明验证中的决策过程）且合理的（对人类有说服力），并能提高验证任务的准确性。 尽管现有的方法利用声明和文档之间的语义或表面形式的相似性度量来检索证据，但它们都依赖于某些启发式方法，这些方法会阻止它们满足所有三个要求。 鉴于此，我们提出了一种名为“ ReRead”的事实验证模型，以检索证据并验证声明，该模型具有以下两个阶段：1）证据检索阶段，该阶段通过使用忠实且合理的证据取回器来获取可解释的证据；2）声明验证阶段，该阶段重新审视检索到的证据以验证声明。 我们在广泛使用的FEVER数据集上验证了所提出的模型，实验结果表明，我们的模型取得了最先进的结果。",
