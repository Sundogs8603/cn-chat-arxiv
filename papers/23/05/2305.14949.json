    "abstract": "This paper proposes a framework to address the issue of data scarcity in Document-Grounded Dialogue Systems(DGDS). Our model leverages high-resource languages to enhance the capability of dialogue generation in low-resource languages. Specifically, We present a novel pipeline CLEM (Cross-Lingual Enhanced Model) including adversarial training retrieval (Retriever and Re-ranker), and Fid (fusion-in-decoder) generator. To further leverage high-resource language, we also propose an innovative architecture to conduct alignment across different languages with translated training. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and we achieved 4th place in the DialDoc 2023 Competition. Therefore, CLEM can serve as a solution to resource scarcity in DGDS and provide useful guidance for multi-lingual alignment tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个框架，解决了文档对话系统中数据稀缺的问题。我们的模型利用高资源语言来增强低资源语言的对话生成能力。具体而言，我们提出了一个新颖的流程CLEM（跨语言增强模型），包括对抗训练的检索器和重新排序器以及融合解码器的生成器Fid（fusion-in-decoder）。为了进一步利用高资源语言，我们还提出了一种创新的架构，通过翻译训练数据在不同语言之间进行对齐。大量的实验结果表明了我们模型的有效性，并且在DialDoc 2023竞赛中获得第四名。因此，CLEM可以作为解决DGDS中资源稀缺问题的方法，并为多语言对齐任务提供有用的指导。",
