    "translated_abstract": "组合优化问题通常是NP难题，因此不适用于精确算法，这使它们成为应用机器学习方法的理想领域。这些问题中高度结构化的限制可能会直接阻碍优化或采样解决方案的空间。另一方面，GFlowNets最近被发现是一种强大的机器，可以顺序地从复合非规范化密度中有效地采样，并具有在CO中分摊此类解决方案搜索过程以及生成不同的解决方案候选项的潜力。在本文中，我们设计了适用于不同组合问题的马尔科夫决策过程（MDP），并提出训练有条件的GFlowNets从解空间中采样的策略。还开发了高效的训练技术来受益于远程信用分配。通过对各种使用合成和实际数据的不同CO任务的广泛实验，我们证明了GFlowNet策略可以有效地找到高质量的解。",
