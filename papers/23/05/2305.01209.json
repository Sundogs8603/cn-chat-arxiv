    "abstract": "Social networks can sustain cooperation by amplifying the consequences of a single defection through a cascade of relationship losses. Building on Jackson et al. (2012), we introduce a novel robustness notion to characterize low cognitive complexity (LCC) networks - a subset of equilibrium networks that imposes a minimal cognitive burden to calculate and comprehend the consequences of defection. We test our theory in a laboratory experiment and find that cooperation is higher in equilibrium than in non-equilibrium networks. Within equilibrium networks, LCC networks exhibit higher levels of cooperation than non-LCC networks. Learning is essential for the emergence of equilibrium play.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交网络可以通过关系损失的连锁反应来维持合作。本文基于Jackson等人(2012)的研究，引入了一个新的鲁棒性概念，来描述低认知复杂度（LCC）网络，即一种计算和理解受到最小认知负担的均衡网络子集，我们在实验室实验证明，相对于非均衡网络，均衡网络中的合作更高。在均衡网络中，LCC网络比非LCC网络更具合作性。学习对于均衡博弈的出现至关重要。",

The experimental results show that within equilibrium networks, low cognitive complexity networks exhibit higher levels of cooperation than non-low cognitive complexity networks."
