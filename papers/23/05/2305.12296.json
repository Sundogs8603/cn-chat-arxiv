    "translated_abstract": "高质量数字材质的制作对于3D渲染的逼真非常关键。以前的材质生成模型都是仅在合成数据上进行训练的，这种数据有现实世界中材质的视觉差距，而且还很难获得。我们提出了PhotoMat来解决这个问题，它是第一个仅基于手机闪光灯拍摄的真实物料照片进行训练的材质生成器。由于在这种情况下，无法获得单独材质地图的监督，因此我们训练了一个神经材质表示生成器，它使用学习的重照明模块渲染成任意光照下的RGB图像，与真实照片使用鉴别器进行比较。然后，我们通过训练材质地图估计器来从神经材质表示中解码材料的反射属性。我们用一个新的数据集训练了PhotoMat，其中包含了手持手机相机在闪光灯照明下捕获的12,000张物料照片。我们证明了我们生成的材料与真实照片相比具有高度的视觉保真度，并且优于依赖合成数据和/或材质地图监督的最先进的生成模型。我们的方法为基于学习的材料创作提供了一个大而多样的真实世界照片集。",
