    "translated_abstract": "相互作用粒子系统在自然界和工程中无处不在。揭示粒子相互作用定律具有基本重要性，但由于底层配置复杂性而具有极大的挑战性。最近开发的机器学习方法在发现同质系统粒子轨迹中的成对相互作用方面显示出极大的潜力。然而，它们无法揭示异质系统中的相互作用，而这种系统在现实中普遍存在，其中多个相互作用类型同时存在，并且需要关系推断。在这里，我们提出了一种新的概率方法用于关系推断，与现有方法相比，具有两个独特的特征：首先，它集体地推断不同边的相互作用类型；其次，它使用物理感应的图神经网络来学习具有物理一致性的成对相互作用。我们在几个基准数据集上评估了所提出的方法，并证明其在推断的相互作用准确性和保持物理保真度方面一致优于现有方法。具体而言，我们的方法确定了具有重要物理意义的新型相互作用类型，揭示了统治系统的隐藏物理原理，并在提高物理性质的预测方面显示出极大的潜力。",

It outperforms existing methods in the accuracy of inferred interactions and in maintaining physics fidelity, and shows great potential in revealing hidden physical principles and improving physical property predictions."
