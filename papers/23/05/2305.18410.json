    "translated_abstract": "随着医疗保健领域对更易用和可解释的机器学习模型的需求增加，发展和利用因果推断算法以通过分析观测数据发现因果关系变得越来越重要。可解释的方法有助于临床医生和生物学家预测疾病预后并建议适当的治疗方法。然而，在因果推断、基因组学和乳腺癌交叉领域上极少进行研究，我们旨在填补这一空白。此外，真实数据上对因果推断方法的评估普遍极为困难，因为地面真实的因果关系通常是未知的。因此，在本文中，我们还提议使用大规模语言模型来解决评估问题。具体来说，我们利用合适的因果推断算法来研究基因组中各种扰动如何影响乳腺癌患者的生存。我们使用了三种主要的因果推断方法。",
