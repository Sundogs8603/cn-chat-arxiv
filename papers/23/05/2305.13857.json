    "translated_abstract": "大多数任务导向对话(TOD)基准假定用户精确地知道如何使用系统，通过将用户行为限制在系统的能力范围内，即“用户熟悉度”偏见。当这种数据偏见与数据驱动的TOD系统相结合时，该偏见加深了，因为使用现有的静态评估无法理解其影响。因此，我们进行了一项交互式用户研究，揭示TOD系统在真实场景下的脆弱性。具体而言，我们比较了具有1）符合系统边界的详细目标说明（封闭目标）和2）通常不受支持但现实（开放目标）的模糊目标说明的用户。我们的研究发现，在开放目标设置下的对话会导致系统严重失败，92%的对话存在显著的问题。此外，我们进行了彻底的分析，通过错误注释识别两种设置之间的显著特征。从中我们发现了一种新的错误类型称为“不匹配错误”，这表明用户和系统无法建立共享的语境理解。本研究强调了在TOD评估中考虑用户熟悉度偏见的重要性，并开发更强大的系统来处理实际情况。",
