    "translated_abstract": "在许多场景下，推荐系统中的用户交互数据（如点击或评分）往往很少，物品的换手率（例如新文章、招聘信息）很高。因此，除了用户-物品评分外，集成上下文“边”信息是非常可取的。虽然存在可以同时处理评分和上下文数据的算法，但这些算法通常仅能进行样本内推荐，受到维度诅咒的限制，并不采用多臂老虎机（MAB）策略进行长期累积收益优化。我们提出了多视角交互主题回归（MV-ICTR）算法，这是一种新颖的部分在线潜在因子推荐算法，同时纳入评分和上下文信息来建模物品特定功能的相关性和用户的个人偏好，采用多臂老虎机策略进行持续在线个性化。该算法在数据集上的性能显著提高。",
