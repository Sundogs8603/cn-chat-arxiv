    "abstract": "The main objective of Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings is to learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations, enabling the prediction of missing facts. A significant challenge in achieving better KG embeddings lies in capturing relation patterns, including symmetry, antisymmetry, inversion, commutative composition, non-commutative composition, hierarchy, and multiplicity. This study introduces a novel model called 3H-TH (3D Rotation and Translation in Hyperbolic space) that captures these relation patterns simultaneously. In contrast, previous attempts have not achieved satisfactory performance across all the mentioned properties at the same time. The experimental results demonstrate that the new model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy, hierarchy property, and other relation patterns in low-dimensional space, meanwhile performing similarly in high-dimensional space.",

    "translated_abstract": "知识图（KG）嵌入的主要目标是学习实体和关系的低维表示，以便预测缺失的事实。在实现更好的KG嵌入中的一个重要挑战是捕捉关系模式，包括对称性、反对称性、反转、可交换组合、非可交换组合、层次结构和多重性。本研究引入了一种称为3H-TH（双曲空间中的三维旋转和平移）的新模型，可以同时捕捉这些关系模式。相比之下，先前的尝试没有同时在所有提到的属性上实现令人满意的性能。实验证明，新模型在低维空间的精度、层次结构和其他关系模式方面优于现有的最先进模型，同时在高维空间中表现类似。",
