    "abstract": "This study explores the benefits and challenges of integrating Artificial Intelligence with Agile software development methodologies, focusing on improving continuous integration and delivery. A systematic literature review and longitudinal meta-analysis of the retrieved studies was conducted to analyse the role of Artificial Intelligence and it's future applications within Agile software development. The review helped identify critical challenges, such as the need for specialised socio-technical expertise. While Artificial Intelligence holds promise for improved software development practices, further research is needed to better understand its impact on processes and practitioners, and to address the indirect challenges associated with its implementation.",
