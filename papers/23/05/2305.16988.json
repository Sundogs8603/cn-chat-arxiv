    "translated_abstract": "从观察数据中进行因果推断对于许多学科如医学和经济学至关重要。然而，在放松无混淆性假设（因果敏感性分析）下的因果效应的尖锐界限仍在研究中。到目前为止，具有尖锐界限的工作仅限于相对简单的设置（例如，单一二元治疗）。在本文中，我们提出了一个统一的框架，用于各种设置下的未观察混淆因素下的因果敏感性分析。为此，我们提出了边际敏感性模型（MSM）的灵活推广，然后推导出大类因果效应的尖锐界限。这包括（条件）平均处理效应，中介分析和路径分析的效应，以及分布效应。此外，我们的敏感性模型适用于离散、连续和时变的治疗。它使我们能够将未观察混淆导致的部分识别问题解释为分布偏移的问题。",
