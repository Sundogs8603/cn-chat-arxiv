    "translated_abstract": "在电力市场的投标游戏中，纳什均衡（NE）估计是发电公司（GENCO）进行投标策略优化和独立系统运营商（ISO）进行市场监视的关键问题。然而，现有的NE估计方法在新兴现代电力市场（FEM）中是不准确和低效的，因为在任何环境变化之前，如负载需求变化、网络拥堵和市场设计的修改，投标策略的先验知识没有充分利用。为此，本文针对FEM开发了Bayes自适应马尔科夫决策过程（BAMDP-FEM），以考虑先验知识来建模GENCO的投标策略优化。随后提出了一种新颖的多智能体生成对抗模仿学习算法（MAGAIL-FEM），使GENCO能够同时从先验知识和与变化环境的交互中进行学习。得到的NE是一种贝叶斯纳什均衡（BNE）。",
