    "translated_abstract": "尽管能够训练出表现优秀的大型语言模型（LLMs），但其保持相关性和纠正错误的方法仍然难以确定。为此，最近几年出现了许多编辑LLMs的技术，其目标是在特定领域内高效地改变LLMs的行为，同时不对其他输入的性能产生负面影响。本文深入探讨了与LLMs模型编辑相关的问题、方法和机会。特别是，我们提供了关于模型编辑任务定义和相关挑战的全面概述，以及对目前最先进的方法的深入实证分析。我们还构建了一个新的基准数据集，以促进更强大的评估，并指出现有技术固有的持久问题。我们的目标是为每种编辑技术的效果和可行性提供有价值的见解，从而帮助社区在LLMs的管理中取得更好的结果。",
