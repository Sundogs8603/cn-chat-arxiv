    "translated_abstract": "关系提取旨在根据两个实体的语境提取潜在关系，因此，从句子中推导出合理的语境非常重要。以往的研究要么专注于如何利用实体信息（例如，实体类型，实体用语）来推断关系，但忽略了以语境为重点的内容，要么使用反事实思维来消除模型对实体潜在关系的偏见，但关系推理过程仍会受到无关内容的干扰。因此，如何保留有关内容并从句子中去掉噪音段落是一项关键任务。此外，保留的内容需要足够流畅，以保持语义的连贯性和可解释性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的理据抽取框架RE2，它利用两个连续性和稀疏性因素从句子中获取相关而连贯的理据。为了解决黄金理据未标记的问题，RE2应用一种无监督方法生成候选理据，并选择最相关和连贯的理据来指导RE模型。两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的模型优于现有的最先进方法，并且提取出的理据对于推理和解释是有用的。",
