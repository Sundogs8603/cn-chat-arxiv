    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑重复的多单位拍卖与统一定价，这种拍卖在实践中被广泛用于分配诸如碳排放许可证之类的商品。在每一轮中，$K$个相同的商品单元被卖给一组具有递减边际回报价值的买家。买家为商品单位提交出价，然后根据出价确定一个单位的价格$p$，使得所有单位都能被售出。我们考虑拍卖的两个变体，其中价格分别设为第$K$高出价和第$(K+1)$高出价。我们在离线和在线设置中分析了拍卖的性质。在离线设置中，我们考虑一个玩家$i$面临的问题：在过去的拍卖中，给定包含竞争对手提交的出价的数据集，找到一个出价向量，使得玩家$i$在该数据集上的累积效用最大化。我们设计了一个多项式时间算法来解决这个问题，通过将其等价于在仔细构造的有向图上找到最大权重路径。",
