    "abstract": "We present the training recipe and results of scaling up PaLI-X, a multilingual vision and language model, both in terms of size of the components and the breadth of its training task mixture. Our model achieves new levels of performance on a wide-range of varied and complex tasks, including multiple image-based captioning and question-answering tasks, image-based document understanding and few-shot (in-context) learning, as well as object detection, video question answering, and video captioning. PaLI-X advances the state-of-the-art on most vision-and-language benchmarks considered (25+ of them). Finally, we observe emerging capabilities, such as complex counting and multilingual object detection, tasks that are not explicitly in the training mix.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了扩展PaLI-X，一种多语言视觉与语言模型的训练配方和结果，包括组件的大小和训练任务范围的广度。我们的模型在多个基于图像的字幕和问答任务、基于图像的文档理解和少量（上下文内）学习以及对象检测、视频问答和视频字幕等各种复杂任务上实现了新的性能水平。PaLI-X 在大多数视觉语言基准测试中取得了最新的研究成果（考虑了25个以上的测试）。最后，我们观察到了一些新兴的能力，如复杂计数和多语言对象检测，这些任务并没有明确列在训练范围之内。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper introduces a multilingual vision and language model, PaLI-X, which achieves new performance levels on complex tasks, including image-based captioning and question-answering tasks, object detection, video question answering, and video captioning, through scaling up model components and training task mix. Besides, PaLI-X advances the state-of-the-art on most vision-and-language benchmarks considered."
