    "translated_abstract": "大规模电子商务数据分类是一项关键的、广泛应用于工业领域的任务。本文旨在改进一家主要网络公司已经在使用的产品分类模型，该模型用于多种应用。在该模型核心中，产品分类模型是一个文本分类模型，接受产品标题作为输入，并从数千个可用候选项中输出最合适的类别。经过进一步观察，我们发现了类似物品标签上的不一致性。例如，标题中关于颜色或尺寸的小变化，会对模型产生较大影响。这种现象可能会对下游的推荐或搜索应用造成负面影响，导致用户体验下降。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新的框架，实现一致的文本分类。我们的目标是提高模型的一致性，并保持其生产水平的性能。",
