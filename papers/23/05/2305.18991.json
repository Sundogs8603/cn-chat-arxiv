    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种方法，通过使用决策树和随机森林来定位广义自回归得分（GAS）模型（Creal et. al, 2013; Harvey, 2013）的参数，从而改善其预测。这些方法避免了基于核函数的方法所面临的维度灾难，并允许同时利用多个状态变量的信息。我们将新模型应用于四种不同的实证分析中，并且在所有应用中，新的方法都显著优于基线GAS模型。在我们应用于股票回报波动率和密度预测的实验中，最优的GAS树模型揭示了杠杆效应和方差风险溢价效应。我们在股票-债券依赖性的研究中发现了优化的GAS森林预测中的流向质量效应，我们对高频交易持续时间的分析揭示了成交量-波动性效应。",
