    "translated_abstract": "人工智能生成系统已经针对图像、代码、故事和游戏生成等方面开发出来，旨在促进人类创造力的发挥。然而，最近神经生成系统的研究始终强调一种人工智能系统与用户进行互动的方式：用户提供说明（通常是提示）然后AI系统生成内容。然而，在人类和人工智能协作的模式中还有其他配置，例如共创（CC），即人类和人工智能系统都可以贡献内容的创造，以及混合主动（MI）模式，即人类和人工智能系统都可以发起内容的更改请求。本文定义了一个假想的人工智能系统设计空间，由不同的方式组成，人类和人工智能系统可以互相沟通创造性意图。我们进行了一项人类参与研究，有185名参与者，了解用户想要如何与MI-CC系统进行不同配置的交互。我们发现，MI-CC系统中更多由人工智能发起的贡献是用户优先选择的，而非仅依靠人类发起的输入。我们的研究结果表明，探索超越提示的更广泛的MI-CC设计方案可以导致更有效和令人满意的人工智能协作体验。",
    "tldr": "本文介绍了一种新的人工智能系统设计空间，探索了人类和人工智能系统之间各种不同的创意意图沟通方式，发现MI-CC系统中更多由人工智能发起的贡献是用户优先选择的，这说明了超越提示，探索更多的MI-CC设计方案可以提高人工智能协作体验。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a new design space for AI co-creation systems and explores various ways of communication for creative intent between humans and AI systems. The study finds that MI-CC systems with more extensive AI-initiated contributions are preferred by users over systems that rely solely on human-initiated inputs, suggesting that exploring a wider range of MI-CC design options beyond prompts can lead to more effective and satisfying human-AI co-creative experiences."
