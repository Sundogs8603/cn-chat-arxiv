    "abstract": "Definition modeling is an important task in advanced natural language applications such as understanding and conversation. Since its introduction, it focus on generating one definition for a target word or phrase in a given context, which we refer to as Single Definition Modeling (SDM).

In addition, the creation of a training dataset for SDM requires significant human expertise and effort. In this paper, we carefully design a new task called Multiple Definition Modeling (MDM) that pool together all contexts and definition of target words. We demonstrate the ease of creating a model as well as multiple training sets automatically. % In the experiments, we demonstrate and analyze the benefits of MDM, including improving SDM's performance by using MDM as the pretraining task and its comparable performance in the zero-shot setting.",

    "translated_abstract": "定义建模是高级自然语言应用程序（例如理解和对话）中的重要任务。目前，这种模型侧重于在给定上下文中为目标词或短语生成一个定义，我们将其称为单个定义建模（SDM）。然而，这种方法不能充分地模拟单词的不同上下文和定义之间的相关性和模式。此外，为SDM创建训练数据集需要大量的人力专业知识和努力。在本文中，我们精心设计了一个称为多重定义建模（MDM）的新任务，将目标词的所有上下文和定义汇集在一起。我们演示了创建模型以及多个训练集的自动化过程的便利性。在实验中，我们证明并分析了MDM的好处，包括使用MDM作为预训练任务以提高SDM的性能及其在零-shot情况下的性能可比性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new task called Multiple Definition Modeling (MDM) that pool together all contexts and definition of target words, which has better performance compared to Single Definition Modeling (SDM). MDM can improve SDM's performance as the pretraining task, and has comparable performance in the zero-shot setting."
