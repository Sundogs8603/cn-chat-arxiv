    "translated_abstract": "无监督学习，尤其是基于深度学习的方法最近在学术界得到了显著的发展。虽然在各种基准测试中取得了接近监督学习水平的成果，但由于无监督问题的本质，实践中训练和评估 SSL 模型仍然很困难。即使是以有监督的方式训练的网络，在转移到另一个领域时是否能够良好地表现，也往往不清楚。过去的工作通常仅限于评估嵌入中包含的信息量，这对于深度神经网络的自我监督学习最为相关。然而，这项工作选择了不同的方法：我们能否量化数据中如何以稳定的方式进行线性分离？我们调查了相关的文献，并发现三种方法可以用于评估嵌入的质量。此外，我们还介绍了一种基于近期对高维空间理解的最新进展的新方法。",
    "tldr": "这项工作提出了评估嵌入质量的不同方法，关注如何以稳定的方式进行线性分离。从调查的文献和引入的新方法中，我们可以评估嵌入的质量，从而提高无监督学习的表现。(This work proposes new methods to evaluate the quality of embeddings, focusing on stable linear separation. From the surveyed literature and introduced novel methods, we can evaluate the quality of embeddings and improve the performance of unsupervised learning.)"
