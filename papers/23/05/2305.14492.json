    "translated_abstract": "跨文化推理需要建立在相应文化背景下的准确规范基础之上。 然而，当前的社会规范计算模型主要关注美国社会。 本文提出了一种新的方法来发现和比较中国和美国文化的社会规范。 我们通过利用一个中文问答平台 - 知乎 - 和现有的SocialChemistry数据集作为不同文化维度的代理，通过情境对齐跨文化比较社会情境，使用上下文学习从文本中提取社会规范。我们将Chain-of-Thought提示嵌入到人工智能协作框架中，构建了一个高质量的数据集，其中包含3,069个跨中国和美国文化对齐的社会规范以及相应的自由文本解释。为了测试模型在跨文化社会规范方面的推理能力，我们提出了社会规范的可解释文本蕴含任务，其目标是预测一个文化中的社会规范的解释是否暗示另一个文化中的类似规范。我们使用这个任务来评估我们的方法，并发现我们的数据集提供了研究社会文化的异同的丰富机会。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel approach to compare social norms in Chinese and American cultures by aligning social situations and extracting social norms through in-context learning. The authors built a high-quality dataset and introduced the task of explained textual entailment for social norms to test models' ability to reason about cross-cultural social norms. The results show the potential of the approach in studying sociocultural similarities and differences."
