    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一个针对正则随机图的种植顶点覆盖问题，并通过空穴方法对其进行研究。此二元自旋交互作用系统的平衡序相变具有不连续的性质，不同于常规的类似伊辛模型的连续相变，并且在广泛的自由能屏障的动态阻塞下。我们发现，该系统的无序对称相在除了唯一的eureka点$\\beta_b$之外的所有逆温度下都可以在有序相的情况下局部稳定。 eureka点$\\beta_b$为访问具有消失自由能屏障的隐藏基态提供了一个便道。它存在于无限系列的种植随机图集合中，并且我们通过分析确定了它们的结构参数。揭示出的新类型的自由能景观也可能存在于统计物理学和统计学界面的其他种植随机图优化问题中。",
