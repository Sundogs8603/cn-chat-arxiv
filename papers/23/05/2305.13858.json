    "abstract": "This dissertation presents a methodology for recording speed climbing training sessions with multiple cameras and annotating the videos with relevant data, including body position, hand and foot placement, and timing. The annotated data is then analyzed using deep learning techniques to create a standard dataset of speed climbing training videos. The results demonstrate the potential of the new dataset for improving speed climbing training and research, including identifying areas for improvement, creating personalized training plans, and analyzing the effects of different training methods.The findings will also be applied to the training process of the Jiangxi climbing team through further empirical research to test the findings and further explore the feasibility of this study.",
