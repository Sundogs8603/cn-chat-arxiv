    "translated_abstract": "深度顺序识别模型因在各种应用中的优越性能受到越来越多的关注。大多数深度顺序识别模型仅使用目标序列作为监督，而未考虑其他相关序列，导致其预测结果过于自信。已有的深度顺序识别模型使用标签平滑来对标签进行调整以降低自信度，但它们并未考虑令牌/序列之间的关联性，这些关联性可能为正则化训练提供更加有效的信息，进而导致次优的性能。因此，本研究发现与目标序列高度感知和语义相关的令牌/序列包含了更具相关性和更有效的信息，从而有助于更有效地进行正则化。为此，我们提出了一个感知及语义感知序列正则化体系结构，探索联想感知和语义相似性的令牌/序列，从而提高模型的性能。",
