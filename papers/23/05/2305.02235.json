    "translated_abstract": "标注长文档问答是耗时且昂贵的。为了缓解这个问题，可能可以通过无监督问答方法生成长文档问答对。然而，现有的UQA任务基于短文档，难以纳入长距离信息。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新任务，名为无监督长文档问答（ULQA），旨在以无监督方式生成高质量的长文档QA实例。此外，我们提出了AttenWalker，一种新型的无监督方法，用于聚合和生成具有长距离依赖性的答案，以构建长文档QA对。在CoQA数据集上的实验结果表明了我们提出的无监督长文档QA方法的有效性。",
    "tldr": "AttenWalker是一种基于Attention的图遍历方法，用于实现无监督长文档问答。它由三个模块组成：span collector、span linker和answer aggregator。这些模块结合使用来选择有信息量的候选span，将这些span串联起来形成完整答案，并生成最终答案。在CoQA数据集上获得了良好的实验结果。",
    "en_tdlr": "AttenWalker is an attention-based graph walking method for unsupervised long-document question answering. It consists of three modules: span collector, span linker, and answer aggregator. These modules work together to select informative candidate spans, link them together to form complete answers, and generate final answers. AttenWalker achieves promising performance on the CoQA dataset."
