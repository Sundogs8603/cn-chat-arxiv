    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了修正版的保守型物理信息神经网络(cPINN)，用于构建非守恒形式下双曲线标量守恒律的Riemann问题的弱解。为了证明结果，我们使用了具有不连续孔隙度的广义Buckley-Leverett方程(GBL)模型。通过引入一个新的未知量，GBL方程转化为二乘二共振双曲线守恒定律的保守形式。为了克服孔隙度不连续和Riemann数据中关键状态(接近真空)的出现带来的困难，我们发明了修改后的cPINN方法。通过使用深度学习算法解决GBL方程的保守形式和非守恒形式以及临界状态和非临界状态的情况，我们验证了我们的想法。该方法提供了两种不同神经网络和相应的最优参数的合并。",
