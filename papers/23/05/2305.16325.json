    "translated_abstract": "廉价的机器学习势场越来越被用于加速材料的结构优化和分子动力学模拟，通过迭代性地预测和应用原子间力。在这些情况下，检测到预测的不可靠性以避免错误或误导性结果至关重要。本文提出了一个完整的框架来培训和重新校准图神经网络合奏模型，以产生带有校准不确定性估计的能量和力的准确预测。所提出的方法考虑到了Epistemic和Aleatoric不确定性，通过非线性缩放函数在后期重新调整了总不确定性，从而在以前未见过的数据上实现良好的校准性能，而不会损失预测准确性。该方法在两个具有挑战性且公开可用的数据集上进行了演示和评估，ANI-1x（Smith等人）和Transition1x（Schreiner等人），这两个数据集都包含远离平衡状态的多样化构象。",
