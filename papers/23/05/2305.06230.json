    "translated_abstract": "本文使用广泛的损失函数，对于学习弱相关性过程进行了稀疏惩罚深度神经网络预测。我们处理包括回归估计、分类、时间序列预测在内的一般框架，考虑了$\\psi$弱相关结构，并针对有界观测的特定情况，也使用了$\\theta_\\infty$系数。在这种$\\theta_\\infty$弱相依的情况下，提供了一种在深度神经网络预测器类中提供非渐近泛化界限。对于学习$\\psi$和$\\theta_\\infty$弱相关的过程，确定了稀疏惩罚深度神经网络估计器超额风险的神谕不等式。当目标函数足够光滑时，这些超额风险的收敛速度接近于$\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/3})$。提供了一些模拟结果，并应用于Vitória颗粒物的预测。",

The method is applied to the forecast of the particulate matter in Vitória."
