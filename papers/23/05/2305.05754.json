    "translated_abstract": "在协作任务中，有效的交流对于实现共同目标至关重要。其中一个任务是协作建筑，在这个任务中，建筑者必须相互通信，在诸如Minecraft之类的模拟环境中构建所需的结构。我们旨在开发一个智能建筑代理，根据用户对话建造结构。然而，在协作建筑中，建筑者可能会遇到难以解读的情况，因为信息和指令有限，导致模棱两可。在NeurIPS 2022竞赛的NLP任务中，我们回答了两个关键的研究问题，旨在填补这一空白：代理何时应该寻求澄清，应该询问什么澄清问题？我们通过两个子任务朝着这个目标迈进，一个是分类任务，一个是排序任务。对于分类任务，目标是根据当前的世界状态和对话历史确定代理是否应该寻求澄清。对于排序任务，目标是提供一份可能的澄清问题的排名列表。我们的方法结合了基于规则的启发式方法和机器学习模型，并在IGLU NLP挑战数据集上取得了竞争性的性能。",
