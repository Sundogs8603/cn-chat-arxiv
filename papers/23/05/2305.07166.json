    "translated_abstract": "传统的均值方差组合选股问题存在时间不一致策略的问题。Basak and Chabakauri (2010) 提出博弈论方法来寻找(次博弈完美纳什)均衡策略，并通过对应的偏微分方程(PDE)系统来解决。然而，在实际情况中，投资者仅对资产的漂移和波动有估计，例如95%的置信区间。在这种情况下，一些文献(e.g., Pham, Wei and Zhou (2022))推导出了在最坏参数下的最优不一致策略，即稳健控制。本文考虑了一般的动态均值方差框架，并提出了稳健均衡策略的新定义。在我们的定义下，稳健均衡策略存在且唯一。我们还建立了稳健均衡策略与相应的PDE系统之间的严格联系，填补了文献中的空白。此外，我们提供了一种数字方案来解决PDE系统，并通过数值实验证明了我们方法的有效性。",
