    "abstract": "This study aims to develop a single integrated spoofing-aware speaker verification (SASV) embeddings that satisfy two aspects. First, rejecting non-target speakers' input as well as target speakers' spoofed inputs should be addressed. Second, competitive performance should be demonstrated compared to the fusion of automatic speaker verification (ASV) and countermeasure (CM) embeddings, which outperformed single embedding solutions by a large margin in the SASV2022 challenge. We analyze that the inferior performance of single SASV embeddings comes from insufficient amount of training data and distinct nature of ASV and CM tasks. To this end, we propose a novel framework that includes multi-stage training and a combination of loss functions. Copy synthesis, combined with several vocoders, is also exploited to address the lack of spoofed data. Experimental results show dramatic improvements, achieving a SASV-EER of 1.06% on the evaluation protocol of the SASV2022 challenge.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在开发单一综合防欺骗说话人验证嵌入，满足以下两个方面的要求：首先，需要拒绝非目标说话人的输入以及目标说话人的欺骗输入。其次，需要证明其与自动说话人验证 (ASV) 和反欺骗嵌入 (CM) 融合的性能相当，而后者在 SASV2022 挑战中表现远好于单一嵌入的解决方案。我们分析认为单一 SASV 嵌入的劣质性能来自于训练数据量不足和 ASV 与 CM 任务的不同性质。为此，我们提出了一种新的框架，包括多阶段训练和损失函数的组合。同时利用 Copy synthesis 和几个声码器解决欺骗数据不足的问题。实验结果显示出显著的改进，评估 SASV2022 挑战协议时，达到了 SASV-EER 1.06%。",
