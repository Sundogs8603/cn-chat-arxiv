    "translated_abstract": "为了加速在线测试，多臂赌博算法通过自适应地收集数据而被作为固定时间A/B测试的重要补充方式不断提高。本文基于最近关于自适应收集数据的最佳臂识别和统计推断的研究，推导和评估了四种基于贝叶斯批次赌博算法（NB-TS，WB-TS，NB-TTTS，WB-TTTS），它们是两种加权批次（Naive Batch和Weighted Batch）和两种贝叶斯抽样策略（Thompson Sampling和Top-Two Thompson Sampling）的组合，用于自适应确定流量分配。本文提供的这些基于批次统计奖励度量的贝叶斯抽样算法在实践中得以应用，而本文提出的其中一个组合WB-TTTS似乎是最新讨论的。对这四种基于批次的贝叶斯抽样算法进行了全面评估，包括测试方法的可信度、敏感性和后悔度。此外，评估还考虑了批次内奖励度量的方差以及批次之间的相关性，这在以前的研究中尚未得到很好的解决。仿真结果表明，与现有的赌博算法（例如UCB1，TS和Exp3）相比，这些基于批次的贝叶斯算法是有效的。",
