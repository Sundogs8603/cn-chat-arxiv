    "abstract": "Relational databases play an important role in this Big Data era. However, it is challenging for non-experts to fully unleash the analytical power of relational databases, since they are not familiar with database languages such as SQL. Many techniques have been proposed to automatically generate SQL from natural language, but they suffer from two issues: (1) they still make many mistakes, particularly for complex queries, and (2) they do not provide a flexible way for non-expert users to validate and refine the incorrect queries. To address these issues, we introduce a new interaction mechanism that allows users directly edit a step-by-step explanation of an incorrect SQL to fix SQL errors. Experiments on the Spider benchmark show that our approach outperforms three SOTA approaches by at least 31.6% in terms of execution accuracy. A user study with 24 participants further shows that our approach helped users solve significantly more SQL tasks with less time and higher confidence, demo",

    "translated_abstract": "关系数据库在大数据时代扮演着重要角色。然而，非专家很难完全释放关系数据库的分析能力，因为他们不熟悉SQL等数据库语言。许多技术已被提出自然语言自动生成SQL，但它们存在以下两个问题：（1）对于复杂查询它们仍会犯很多错误，（2）它们不提供一种灵活的方式，让非专家用户验证和改进不正确的查询。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了一种新的交互机制，允许用户直接编辑一步步解释错误SQL以修复SQL错误。在Spider基准测试上的实验证明，我们的方法至少比三种最先进方法在执行准确性方面提高了31.6％。24名参与者的用户研究进一步表明，我们的方法帮助用户以更少的时间和更高的信心解决了更多的SQL任务。",
