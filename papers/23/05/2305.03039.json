    "translated_abstract": "计算笔记本，如 Jupyter Notebook，已成为数据科学家的事实编程环境。许多可视化研究者和实践者已开发出支持笔记本的交互式可视化工具。然而，关于在笔记本中设计 VA 工具的适当方法的了解甚少。为了填补这一关键的研究空白，我们通过分析 159 个笔记本 VA 工具及其用户反馈来研究这一领域的设计策略。我们的分析包括来自学术论文的 62 个系统和来自通过在 GitHub 上抓取 860 万个笔记本而获得的包含交互式可视化的 55k 个笔记本池中的 103 个系统。我们还研究了 15 个用户研究的发现和 379 个 GitHub 问题中的用户反馈。通过这项工作，我们确定了未来笔记本 VA 工具的独特设计机会和考虑因素，例如在笔记本中使用和操作多模态数据以及平衡可视化笔记本的程度。",
