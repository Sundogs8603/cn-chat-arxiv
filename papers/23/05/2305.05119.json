    "translated_abstract": "弹性制造催生了复杂的调度问题，如弹性车间调度问题（FJSP）。在FJSP中，操作可以在多台机器上进行处理，导致操作和机器之间存在错综复杂的关系。最近的研究利用深度强化学习（DRL）来学习优先级分配规则（PDRs）以解决FJSP。然而，相对于诸如OR-Tools等精确方法的解决方案，解决方案的质量仍有提高的空间。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种新的端到端学习框架，结合了自注意模型进行深度特征提取和DRL进行可扩展决策制定的优点。操作和机器之间的复杂关系被准确而简洁地表示出来，提出了一个由多个相互连接的操作信息注意块和机器信息注意块组成的双注意力网络（DAN）。DAN利用这些复杂的关系，以协同地确定FJSP的PDRs。",
