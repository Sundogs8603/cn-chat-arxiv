    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能（AI）的发展和应用不断增长，政策制定者越来越在努力解决如何规制该技术的问题。最具影响力的国际倡议是欧洲联盟（EU）的AI法案，旨在建立第一个全面的AI规制框架。本文首次系统分析了非国家行为者对人工智能国际规制的偏好，重点研究了EU AI法案的情况。在理论上，我们阐述了商业行为者和其他非国家行为者在不同的AI行业竞争条件下的规制偏好的论点。在经验上，我们使用关于欧洲AI规制的公共咨询中非国家行为者偏好的数据来测试这些期望。我们的研究结果有三个方面。首先，所有类型的非国家行为者都表达了对AI的担忧，并支持以某种形式规制AI。其次，尽管如此，不同类型的非国家行为者在AI的规制严格性和范围方面存在显着差异。第三，这些差异部分可以通过规制可能带来的行业水平竞争和分配结果的差异来解释。总体而言，我们的分析揭示了AI规制的复杂和有争议的政治，不仅在欧盟内部，而且超越欧盟的背景下也是如此。",

The study finds that while all types of non-state actors express concerns about AI and support regulation, significant differences exist in their preferences regarding the stringency and scope of AI regulation, which can be explained by variations in sector-level competitiveness and potential distributional outcomes of regulation."
