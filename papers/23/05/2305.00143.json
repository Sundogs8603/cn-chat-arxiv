    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了顺序非参数双样本和独立性检验的问题。顺序检验在线处理数据，允许使用观察到的数据来决定是否停止并拒绝原假设，或在保持类型I错误控制的同时收集更多数据。我们建立在(非参数)测试赌博原则之上，其中赌徒在未来观察中下注，他们的财富对证据反对原假设进行衡量。最近开发的基于核的赌博策略在简单分布上通常表现良好，但对于高维或结构化数据（如文本和图像）选择合适的核通常是棘手的。为解决这个问题，我们设计了基于预测的赌博策略，依赖于以下事实：如果一个顺序更新的预测器开始一致地确定(a)一个实例从哪个分布中绘制，或者(b)一个实例是从联合分布还是从边缘分布的乘积中绘制的，则分布是不同或相关的。我们的方法灵活，并对基础数据分布和维度不可知，同时保持一定的最优性保证。我们在模拟和实际数据上演示了我们的顺序测试框架的有效性。",
