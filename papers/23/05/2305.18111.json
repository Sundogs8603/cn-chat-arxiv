    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑测试一个来自许多类别的离散样本对于类别间的均匀分布拟合的问题。作为另一类替代假设，我们考虑去除半径为$\\epsilon$的$\\ell_p$球形替代方案，其中$p\\leq 2$。我们给出了基于直方图（缺失类别、单例、碰撞的数量）的检验在样本数和维数趋向无穷大，$\\epsilon\\to0$时，渐进极小极大风险的一个精确刻画。例如，当$p=1$且期望样本数$n$与类别数$N$的比值很小（也称为“次线性”区域）时，渐进极小极大风险$R^*_\\epsilon$趋近于$2\\bar{\\Phi}\\left(n\\epsilon^2/\\sqrt{8N}\\right)$，其中$\\bar{\\Phi}(x)$是正态残存函数。在一系列问题参数范围内的实证研究表明，这个估计在有限样本中很精确，并且我们的检验显著。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the minimax risk in testing the fit of a discrete sample to the uniform distribution over the categories, with the consideration of missing ball alternatives. The main contribution is a precise characterization of the asymptotic minimax risk, and a testing method based on the occurrences' histogram is proposed and shown to be accurate in empirical studies."
