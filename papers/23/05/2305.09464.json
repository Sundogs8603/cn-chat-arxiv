    "translated_abstract": "大规模开放领域知识图谱(KG)应用于现实世界问题时面临许多独特的挑战。本文介绍了我们平台Saga的扩展，该平台可持续地构建和服务于知识图谱规模。具体而言，我们描述了一个用于训练知识图嵌入的管道，可用于支持主要功能，如事实排名、事实验证、相关实体服务以及支持实体链接。然后，我们描述了如何利用我们的平台（包括图嵌入）来创建语义注释服务，将非结构化Web文档链接到我们KG中的实体。Web的语义注释有效地扩展了我们的知识图谱，提供了链接到开放领域Web内容的边缘，可用于各种搜索和排名问题。最后，我们利用注释的Web文档来推动开放领域知识抽取。这个有针对性的提取框架识别了KG中的重要覆盖问题，然后寻找了目标的相关数据源。",
