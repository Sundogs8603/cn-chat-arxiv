    "translated_abstract": "本文认为机器学习（ML）算法必须要受教育。ML训练的算法的道德决策在人类社会中随处可见，有时会逆转政府、非政府组织和公民社会在过去几十年中取得的社会进步，或者仍在努力实现这些进步。尽管这些算法的决策对人类社会具有不可估量的影响，但它们却是已知的最无知的代理机构之一（数据不完整、不包容或有偏见）。ML算法并不是与我们的人类特质分开而存在的，而是我们最内在的偏见和偏见的一种体现。一些研究致力于责任分配作为解决非道德AI行为的策略。然而，本文认为，AI伦理决策的解决方案在于对ML进行算法教育（而非训练）。从ML和儿童社会责任教育之间的类比中，本文提供了负责任和可持续发展的明确方向。",

The solution for ethical decision-making in AI lies in algorithm education. Machine learning algorithms are not separate from our human idiosyncrasies, but instead, reflect our most implicit prejudices and biases."
