    "abstract": "Deep learning-based image segmentation and detection models have largely improved the efficiency of analyzing retinal landmarks such as optic disc (OD), optic cup (OC), and fovea. However, factors including ophthalmic disease-related lesions and low image quality issues may severely complicate automatic OD/OC segmentation and fovea detection. Most existing works treat the identification of each landmark as a single task, and take into account no prior information. To address these issues, we propose a prior guided multi-task transformer framework for joint OD/OC segmentation and fovea detection, named JOINEDTrans. JOINEDTrans effectively combines various spatial features of the fundus images, relieving the structural distortions induced by lesions and other imaging issues. It contains a segmentation branch and a detection branch. To be noted, we employ an encoder pretrained in a vessel segmentation task to effectively exploit the positional relationship among vessel, OD/OC, and fovea, ",

    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的图像分割和检测模型在分析视网膜标志物（如视盘（OD），视杯（OC）和黄斑）方面的效率已大大提高。然而，眼科疾病相关病变和低图像质量问题等因素可能严重复杂化自动OD / OC分割和黄斑检测。大多数现有作品将每个标志物的识别视为单个任务，并考虑先前的信息。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个先验引导多任务Transformer框架，用于联合OD / OC分割和黄斑检测，命名为JOINEDTrans。JOINEDTrans有效地结合了视网膜图像的各种空间特征，缓解了病变和其他成像问题引起的结构失真。它包含一个分割分支和一个检测分支。值得注意的是，我们采用了在血管分割任务中预训练的编码器，以有效利用血管，OD / OC和黄斑之间的位置关系。",
