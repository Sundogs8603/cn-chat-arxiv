    "translated_abstract": "本体论在语义网络技术中发挥着至关重要的作用，提供了一种结构化和标准化的知识表示方式，使机器能够理解数据的含义。已经制定了几个分类学和本体，但个人只针对一个领域，其中一些在时间和手动工作方面显得昂贵。同时，它们需要更多涵盖非传统主题的内容，以呈现更全面和全面的知识格局和跨学科合作。因此，需要有一个覆盖科学和技术领域的本体，通过连接可能相关或具有共同点的不同领域和领域的主题，便于跨学科研究。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种自动科学技术本体（S＆TO），涵盖了不同科学技术领域的非传统主题。所提出的S＆TO可以促进发现新的研究领域和学科间的合作，并在科学技术中实现数据驱动的研究。",
