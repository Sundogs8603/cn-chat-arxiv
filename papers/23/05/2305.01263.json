    "translated_abstract": "安全和成本是自主驾驶技术开发的两个重要问题。从学术研究到商业应用，都需要充分的模拟和真实世界测试。通常会在模拟环境中进行大规模的测试，然后将学习到的驾驶知识转移到真实世界，因此如何将在模拟中学习到的驾驶知识适应现实成为一个关键问题。然而，虚拟仿真世界与现实世界在许多方面（如照明、纹理、车辆动力学和代理行为等）存在差异，这使得弥合虚拟和真实世界之间的差距变得困难。这个差距通常被称为现实差距（RG）。近年来，研究人员探索了各种方法来解决现实差距问题，这些方法可以广泛地分为两类：从模拟到现实的知识转移（sim2real）和从真实世界数据中学习以提高仿真精度（数字孪生）。本文综述了自主驾驶中的sim2real和数字孪生方法，审查了当前的技术和应用，以及它们的优点和局限性。",
    "tldr": "本文综述了自主驾驶中的sim2real和数字孪生方法，它们分别解决了从模拟到现实的知识转移和从真实世界数据中学习以提高仿真精度的问题，但也存在各自的优缺点和限制。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper provides a comprehensive survey on sim2real and digital twin approaches in autonomous driving, which respectively resolve the issues of transferring knowledge from simulation to reality and learning from real-world data to improve simulation accuracy, while also having their own advantages, limitations, and challenges."
