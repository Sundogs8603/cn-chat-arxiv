    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) represents a technological upheaval with the potential to change human society. Because of its transformative potential, AI is increasingly becoming subject to regulatory initiatives at the global level. Yet, so far, scholarship in political science and international relations has focused more on AI applications than on the emerging architecture of global AI regulation. The purpose of this article is to outline an agenda for research into the global governance of AI. The article distinguishes between two broad perspectives: an empirical approach, aimed at mapping and explaining global AI governance; and a normative approach, aimed at developing and applying standards for appropriate global AI governance.

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能代表了一场潜在改变人类社会的技术变革。由于其变革潜力，人工智能越来越受到全球监管举措的影响。然而，到目前为止，政治学和国际关系的学者更多地关注于人工智能应用，而不是全球人工智能监管的新兴架构。本文旨在概述人工智能全球治理研究的议程。本文区分了两种广泛的视角：一种是实证方法，旨在绘制和解释全球人工智能治理；另一种是规范方法，旨在开发和应用适当的全球人工智能治理标准。这两种方法提供了有助于理解人工智能全球治理新兴情况的问题、概念和理论。相反，探索人工智能作为监管问题提供了一个重要机会，可以优化现有的一般方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This article proposes an research agenda for the global governance of AI, including empirical and normative methods. The empirical approach aims to map and explain global AI governance, while the normative approach aims to develop and apply global AI governance standards. Additionally, the article suggests that exploring AI as a regulatory issue provides a critical opportunity to refine existing general approaches."
