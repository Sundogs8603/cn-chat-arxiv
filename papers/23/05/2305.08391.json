    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型，如ChatGPT，在许多下游任务中表现出显著的能力，然而它们理解对话结构的能力仍然较少被探讨，这需要更高级别的理解和推理能力。本文旨在系统地检查ChatGPT在两个话语分析任务中的表现：主题分割和话语解析，重点关注其对话底层线性和分层话语结构的深层语义理解。为了指导ChatGPT完成这些任务，我们首先构建了一个包含任务描述、输出格式和结构化输入的提示模板。然后，我们在四个流行的主题分割数据集和两个话语解析数据集上进行实验。实验结果表明，ChatGPT在识别通用领域对话中的主题结构方面表现出了熟练度，但在话语解析方面却遇到了相当大的困难。",
