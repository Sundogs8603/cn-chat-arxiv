    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体平台在信息传播和消费等方面给我们带来了许多便利。然而，这些平台也存在着被滥用的潜在风险。恶意用户用它们来散播仇恨言论、攻击性内容、谣言等，以获得社会和政治议程，或者伤害个人、实体和组织。通常情况下，一些用户在未经验证的情况下无意中分享信息，或者无意中发布有害信息。一些此类内容经常被平台删除，可能是因为违反了条款和政策，也可能是由于用户自己的不同原因，比如后悔了。目前有许多研究对删除内容进行了表征、理解和预测。然而，旨在识别删除的细致原因（例如，帖子令人反感、仇恨言论或没有可识别的原因）的研究是有限的。在本研究中，我们通过识别即将发布的被删除的推文，并推理它们的潜在危害和违反平台政策的原因来填补这一空白。我们提出了一个基于深度学习的框架，利用推文的各种特征来预测它们是否会被删除，如果会被删除，则是为什么。我们的方法在识别删除的推文及其原因方面取得了高准确性，可以成为促进更安全和负责任的社交媒体使用的有价值的工具。",
