    "translated_abstract": "最近，中文文本错误纠正的工作大多集中在中文拼写检查（CSC）和中文语法错误诊断（CGED）上。相比之下，对于缺乏相关数据集的中文语义错误诊断（CSED）这一复杂问题，却没有得到足够的关注。研究语义错误很重要，因为它们很常见，并且可能导致句法不规则甚至理解问题。为了研究这个问题，我们建立了CSED语料库，其中包括两个数据集。一个是用于CSED识别（CSED-R）任务，另一个是用于CSED更正（CSED-C）任务。我们的注释通过质量保证机制保证了高质量的数据。我们的实验表明，强大的预训练模型在这个语料库上表现不佳。我们还发现，CSED任务具有挑战性，因为即使是人类得分也很低。本文提出了基于句法的模型，专门针对CSED任务进行适应。实验结果表明，我们提出的模型在CSED-R和CSED-C任务上均取得了最新的最佳表现，超过了以前的最佳模型。",
