    "translated_abstract": "在深度强化学习中，探索问题是主要挑战之一。最近，一些有希望的工作尝试使用基于群体的方法来处理这个问题，通过从不同探索策略的人群中收集具有不同行为的样本。自适应策略选择已被用于行为控制。然而，行为选择空间在很大程度上受到预定义策略种群的限制，这进一步限制了行为多样性。在本文中，我们提出了一个通用框架称为可学习的行为控制（LBC）来解决这种限制。该框架a)通过从所有策略中制定混合行为映射，实现了显著扩大的行为选择空间；b)构建了一个统一的可学习的行为选择过程。我们将LBC引入分布式离线演员-评论家方法中，并通过基于赌博机的元控制器优化行为映射的选择来实现行为控制。我们的代理已经在10个Atari游戏中达到了人类水平，并在7个游戏中达到了目前的最高分。我们还展示了LBC框架的良好泛化能力，并在机器人控制任务上进行了测试。",
