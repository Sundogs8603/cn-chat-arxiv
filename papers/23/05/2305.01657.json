    "translated_abstract": "对于联邦和群智学习中的数据估值研究，现有文献集中在估算客户端贡献上，并且在数据在客户端之间是独立同分布(IID)时表现最佳。然而，在实际的应用中，数据很少是IID分布的。我们提出了一种名为DDVal的方法，用于在联邦和群智学习中的分散式数据估值，可以估算单个数据点的价值。DDVal基于共享深度特征，并通过k最近邻逼近方法来估算Shapley值。这允许新的应用，例如同时向机构和个人奖励为分散式机器学习任务提供数据的贡献。通过DDVal对数据点进行估值，还能对机构的贡献进行层次化的结论，我们通过实验证明DDVal在估算机构贡献时的准确性比现有的联邦学习Shapley值逼近方法高。具体而言，它达到了...",
