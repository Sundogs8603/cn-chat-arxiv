    "translated_abstract": "如果建立在集体变量之上的神经网络（NN）理论将为科学家提供更好地理解每个阶段的学习过程的工具。在这项工作中，我们介绍了两个这样的变量，即基于传递给模型的训练数据构建的经验神经切向核（NTK）的熵和迹线。我们在这些变量的背景下对NN性能进行了实证分析，并发现起始熵、NTK的迹线与训练完成后计算的模型推广之间存在相关性。然后，将此框架应用于NN训练的最佳数据选择问题。为此，使用随机网络提炼（RND）作为选择训练数据的手段，然后与随机选取数据进行比较。结果表明，RND选择的数据集不仅能够胜过随机选取，而且与RND数据集相关联的集体变量比随机选取的要大。",

Two variables, entropy and trace of the empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK), are introduced and empirically analyzed. The study shows that these variables are correlated with the model performance. Random network distillation (RND) is used for optimal data selection, and it is found that RND-selected datasets outperform randomly selected ones and are associated with larger collective variables."
