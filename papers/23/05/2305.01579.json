    "abstract": "Most existing retrieval-augmented language models (LMs) for question answering assume all retrieved information is factually correct. In this work, we study a more realistic scenario in which retrieved documents may contain misinformation, causing conflicts among them. We observe that the existing models are highly brittle to such information in both fine-tuning and in-context few-shot learning settings. We propose approaches to make retrieval-augmented LMs robust to misinformation by explicitly fine-tuning a discriminator or prompting to elicit discrimination capability in GPT-3. Our empirical results on open-domain question answering show that these approaches significantly improve LMs' robustness to knowledge conflicts. We also provide our findings on interleaving the fine-tuned model's decision with the in-context learning process, paving a new path to leverage the best of both worlds.",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数现有的检索增强语言模型（LM）假定所有检索到的信息都是事实上正确的。本文研究一个更加现实的场景，即检索到的文档可能包含虚假信息，从而导致它们之间存在冲突。我们观察到，现有模型在精调和上下文少样本学习设置中对这种信息高度脆弱。我们提出了一些方法，通过明确地对鉴别器进行精细调整或提示来引出GPT-3的鉴别能力，使检索增强LM对虚假信息具有鲁棒性。我们在开放域问答方面的实证结果表明，这些方法显著改善了LM对知识冲突的鲁棒性。我们还提供了关于交替精细调整模型的决策与上下文学习过程的发现，为利用两者的最佳方式铺平了新的道路。",
