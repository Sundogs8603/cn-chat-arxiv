    "abstract": "Style representation learning builds content-independent representations of author style in text. Stylometry, the analysis of style in text, is often performed by expert forensic linguists and no large dataset of stylometric annotations exists for training. Current style representation learning uses neural methods to disentangle style from content to create style vectors, however, these approaches result in uninterpretable representations, complicating their usage in downstream applications like authorship attribution where auditing and explainability is critical. In this work, we use prompting to perform stylometry on a large number of texts to create a synthetic dataset and train human-interpretable style representations we call LISA embeddings. We release our synthetic stylometry dataset and our interpretable style models as resources.",

    "translated_abstract": "风格表示学习可以为文本中的作者风格建立与内容无关的表示。风格分析通常由专业的法医语言学家进行，尚无大型的风格分析注释数据集可供训练。当前的风格表示学习使用神经方法来将风格与内容区分开来创建风格向量，但这些方法产生了难以解释的表示，使得在作者归属等下游应用中的审核和可解释性变得复杂。在这项工作中，我们使用提示语在大量文本上执行风格分析，创建了一个合成的数据集，并训练出了我们称之为LISA嵌入的可解释风格表示。我们将我们的合成风格分析数据集和可解释风格模型发布为资源。",
