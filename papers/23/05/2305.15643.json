Addressing these issues, we propose Federated Dual Extrapolation (FeDualEx), an extra-step primal-dual algorithm, which is the first of its kind that encompasses both saddle point optimization and composite objectives under the FL paradigm. Both the convergence analysis and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of FeDualEx in these challenging settings.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于在机器学习中的关键作用，解决鞍点问题的联邦学习方法变得越来越流行。然而现有的方法主要针对欧几里得空间中的平滑无约束目标函数，而机器学习问题往往涉及约束或非平滑正则化，这导致需要进行复合优化。为了应对这些问题，我们提出了联邦对偶外推（FeDualEx），这是一种额外步骤的原始—对偶算法，是第一种在联邦学习范式下包括了鞍点优化和复合目标的方法。收敛分析和实证评估都证明了 FeDualEx 在这些具有挑战性的场景下的有效性。此外，即使对于 FeDualEx 的顺序版本，我们也为随机复合鞍点设置提供了速率，这是据我们所知之前的文献中没有找到的。",
