    "abstract": "The ability of ChatGPT to generate human-like responses and understand context has made it a popular tool for conversational agents, content creation, data analysis, and research and innovation. However, its effectiveness and ease of accessibility makes it a prime target for generating malicious content, such as phishing attacks, that can put users at risk. In this work, we identify several malicious prompts that can be provided to ChatGPT to generate functional phishing websites. Through an iterative approach, we find that these phishing websites can be made to imitate popular brands and emulate several evasive tactics that have been known to avoid detection by anti-phishing entities. These attacks can be generated using vanilla ChatGPT without the need of any prior adversarial exploits (jailbreaking).",

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT的人类回答生成和上下文理解能力使其成为了对话代理、内容创作、数据分析以及研究和创新的热门工具。但其有效性和易用性也使其成为生成恶意内容的主要工具，例如网络钓鱼攻击，这会使用户处于危险之中。在本文中，我们识别了可提供给ChatGPT的多种恶意提示，以生成功能性的网络钓鱼网站。通过迭代式方法，我们发现这些钓鱼网站可以模仿流行品牌并模拟多种规避策略，这些策略已被知道可以避免反网络钓鱼机构的检测。这些攻击可以使用普通的ChatGPT生成，无需使用任何先前的对抗性攻击（越狱）。",
