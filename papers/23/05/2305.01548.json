    "abstract": "In conversational question answering, users express their information needs through a series of utterances with incomplete context. Typical ConvQA methods rely on a single source (a knowledge base (KB), or a text corpus, or a set of tables), thus being unable to benefit from increased answer coverage and redundancy of multiple sources. Our method EXPLAIGNN overcomes these limitations by integrating information from a mixture of sources with user-comprehensible explanations for answers. It constructs a heterogeneous graph from entities and evidence snippets retrieved from a KB, a text corpus, web tables, and infoboxes. This large graph is then iteratively reduced via graph neural networks that incorporate question-level attention, until the best answers and their explanations are distilled. Experiments show that EXPLAIGNN improves performance over state-of-the-art baselines. A user study demonstrates that derived answers are understandable by end users.",

    "translated_abstract": "在对话问答中，用户通过一系列上下文不完整的表达来表达他们的信息需求。典型的 ConvQA 方法依赖于单一数据源(知识库、文本语料库或一组表格)，因此无法从多个数据源的覆盖范围和冗余性中获益。我们的 EXPLAIGNN 方法通过混合数据源并提供用户可理解的答案解释来克服这些限制。它从知识库、文本语料库、网络表格和信息框中检索实体和证据片段，并构建一个异构图。然后通过图神经网络进行迭代缩减，直到最佳答案及其解释被提炼出来。实验证明，EXPLAIGNN 提高了现有基线方式的性能。用户研究表明，导出的答案被终端用户理解。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出 EXPLAIGNN 方法，使用图神经网络构建异构图，从多个数据源中提取信息，达到更全面准确的问答效果，并提供了用户可理解的答案解释。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes the EXPLAIGNN method, which builds a heterogeneous graph using graph neural networks to extract information from multiple sources and achieve more comprehensive and accurate question answering, and provides user understandable explanations for the answers. The method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and has been validated in a user study."
