    "translated_abstract": "设计新分子对于药物研发和材料科学至关重要。最近，旨在模拟分子分布的深度生成模型在缩小化学研究领域和生成高保真度分子方面取得了有希望的进展。然而，当前的生成模型只关注于模拟2D键合图或3D几何，这是分子的两个互补描述符。联合建模能力的不足限制了生成质量的提高和进一步的下游应用。在这篇论文中，我们提出了一种新的联合2D和3D扩散模型（JODO），它能够生成具有原子类型、化学键信息和3D坐标的完整分子。为了在扩散过程中捕获分子图和几何之间的相关性，我们开发了一个扩散图变换器来参数化数据预测模型，以从噪声数据中恢复原始数据。扩散图变换器在扩散过程中相互作用节点和边缘特征，使得JODO能够捕捉2D键合图和3D分子几何的联合分布。",
