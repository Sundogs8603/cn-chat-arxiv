    "abstract": "This paper explores the use of text data augmentation techniques to enhance conflict and duplicate detection in software engineering tasks through sentence pair classification. The study adapts generic augmentation techniques such as shuffling, back translation, and paraphrasing and proposes new data augmentation techniques such as Noun-Verb Substitution, target-lemma replacement and Actor-Action Substitution for software requirement texts. A comprehensive empirical analysis is conducted on six software text datasets to identify conflicts and duplicates among sentence pairs. The results demonstrate that data augmentation techniques have a significant impact on the performance of all software pair text datasets. On the other hand, in cases where the datasets are relatively balanced, the use of augmentation techniques may result in a negative effect on the classification performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了使用文本数据增强技术来增强通过句对分类进行的软件工程任务中的冲突和重复检测。该研究采用了常见的增强技术，如打乱顺序，回译和释义，并提出了新的数据增强技术，如名词-动词替换，目标-引理替换和演员-动作替换用于软件需求文本。通过对六个软件文本数据集进行全面的实证分析，以识别句对之间的冲突和重复。结果表明，数据增强技术对所有软件句对文本数据集的性能都有显着影响。另一方面，在数据集相对平衡的情况下，使用增强技术可能会对分类性能产生负面影响。",
