    "abstract": "We introduce and demonstrate how to effectively train multilingual machine translation models with pixel representations. We experiment with two different data settings with a variety of language and script coverage, demonstrating improved performance compared to subword embeddings. We explore various properties of pixel representations such as parameter sharing within and across scripts to better understand where they lead to positive transfer. We observe that these properties not only enable seamless cross-lingual transfer to unseen scripts, but make pixel representations more data-efficient than alternatives such as vocabulary expansion. We hope this work contributes to more extensible multilingual models for all languages and scripts.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍并展示了如何通过像素表示有效地训练多语言机器翻译模型。我们在两种不同的数据设置下进行实验，涵盖了多种语言和文字，与子词嵌入相比，表现出更好的性能。我们探索了像素表示的各种属性，如脚本内和脚本间的参数共享，以更好地理解它们在何处实现了积极的迁移。我们观察到，这些属性不仅使得无缝跨语言转移到未见过的文字成为可能，而且使像素表示比其他方法如词汇扩展更具数据效率。我们希望这项工作能为所有语言和文字创造更具可扩展性的多语言模型。",
