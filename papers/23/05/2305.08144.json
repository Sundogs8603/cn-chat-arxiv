To help the research of InfoUI interaction, a novel platform Mobile-Env is presented in this paper. The Mobile-Env platform is designed to be flexible, adaptable, and easily-extended. Based on Mobile-Env, an InfoUI task set is then built for a demonstration and evaluation. An agent based on the large-scale language model (LLM) is tested on the task set. The experiment results demonstrate the great potential of the LLM to do text understanding and matching and, meanwhile, reveal the necessity of a better mechanism of interaction feedback and exploration.
