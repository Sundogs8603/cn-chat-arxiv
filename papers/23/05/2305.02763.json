    "abstract": "The anonymity on the Darknet allows vendors to stay undetected by using multiple vendor aliases or frequently migrating between markets. Consequently, illegal markets and their connections are challenging to uncover on the Darknet. To identify relationships between illegal markets and their vendors, we propose VendorLink, an NLP-based approach that examines writing patterns to verify, identify, and link unique vendor accounts across text advertisements (ads) on seven public Darknet markets. In contrast to existing literature, VendorLink utilizes the strength of supervised pre-training to perform closed-set vendor verification, open-set vendor identification, and low-resource market adaption tasks. Through VendorLink, we uncover (i) 15 migrants and 71 potential aliases in the Alphabay-Dreams-Silk dataset, (ii) 17 migrants and 3 potential aliases in the Valhalla-Berlusconi dataset, and (iii) 75 migrants and 10 potential aliases in the Traderoute-Agora dataset.

    "translated_abstract": "暗网上的匿名性使得供应商可以使用多个供应商别名或频繁迁移市场而不被发现。因此，在暗网上发现非法市场及其联系人是具有挑战性的。为了识别非法市场和供应商之间的关系，我们提出了VendorLink，这是一种基于NLP的方法，通过检查写作模式来验证、识别和链接七个公共暗网市场上的唯一供应商帐户。与现有文献不同，VendorLink利用有监督的预训练的优势来执行封闭集供应商验证、开放集供应商识别和低资源市场适应任务。通过VendorLink，我们在Alphabay-Dreams-Silk数据集中揭示了15个移民和71个潜在别名，在Valhalla-Berlusconi数据集中揭示了17个移民和3个潜在别名，在Traderoute-Agora数据集中揭示了75个移民和10个潜在别名。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种名为VendorLink的NLP方法，能够有效地识别和链接暗网市场上的供应商被迁移和潜在别名，减少非法市场的匿名性，具有重要的实际意义。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a NLP approach named VendorLink for identifying and linking vendor migrants and potential aliases on darknet markets, which utilizes supervised pre-training and performs closed-set vendor verification, open-set vendor identification, and low-resource market adaption tasks. The approach successfully uncovers a significant number of migrants and potential aliases, providing important practical implications."
