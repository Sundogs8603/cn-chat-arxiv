    "abstract": "The sliding window approach provides an elegant way to handle contexts of sizes larger than the Transformer's input window, for tasks like language modeling. Here we extend this approach to the sequence-to-sequence task of document parsing. For this, we exploit recent progress in transition-based parsing to implement a parser with synchronous sliding windows over source and target. We develop an oracle and a parser for document-level AMR by expanding on Structured-BART such that it leverages source-target alignments and constrains decoding to guarantee synchronicity and consistency across overlapping windows. We evaluate our oracle and parser using the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing 3.0 corpus. On the Multi-Sentence development set of AMR 3.0, we show that our transition oracle loses only 8\\% of the gold cross-sentential links despite using a sliding window. In practice, this approach also results in a high-quality document-level parser with manageable memory requirement",

    "translated_abstract": "滑动窗口方法提供了一种处理超过Transformer输入窗口大小的上下文的优美方式，例如处理语言建模任务。本文将这种方法扩展到文档解析的序列到序列任务中。为此，我们利用了转移句法分析的最新进展，通过在源和目标之间实现同步滑动窗口来实现解析器。我们通过在机构化BART上扩展来开发文档级AMR的oracle和解析器，以利用源-目标对齐并约束解码以保证重叠窗口的同步性和一致性。我们使用抽象意义表示（AMR）3.0语料库评估了我们的oracle和解析器。在AMR 3.0的多句子开发集上，我们展示了我们的转移oracle仅丢失了8％的金句际链接，尽管使用滑动窗口。在实践中，这种方法也产生了一个具有可管理内存要求的高质量文档级解析器。",
