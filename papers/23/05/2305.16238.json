    "abstract": "The kinetic exchange model has gained popularity in the field of statistical mechanics for investigating wealth interaction. Traditionally, kinetic exchange models have been studied without considering preferential interactions. However, in this study, we introduce two types of preferential interactions to explore wealth dynamics and its associated distributions. In the first preference, one agent is randomly selected, while the other agent is chosen randomly with wealth just above or below the first agent. Through this preference, we observe the emergence of a quasi-oligarchic society, where the majority of the wealth cycles around the hand of very few agents. For the second preference, we impose a constraint on the difference in pre-interaction wealth between the two agents. This preference leads to the segregation of society into two distinct economic classes. To investigate these phenomena, we conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations, enabling us to characterize the behavior of ",

    "translated_abstract": "动力交换模型已成为统计力学领域研究财富相互作用的工具。传统上研究动力交换模型时不考虑偏好交互。然而，在本研究中，我们引入了两种偏好交互，以探讨财富动态和其相关分布。通过第一种偏好，我们观察到了准寡头社会的出现，其中大部分财富围绕在极少数代理商手中。对于第二种偏好，我们对两个代理商之间的财富差异施加了限制。这种偏好导致社会分裂为两个不同的经济阶层。我们通过广泛的蒙特卡罗模拟来研究这些现象，从而能够描述市场的行为特征。",
