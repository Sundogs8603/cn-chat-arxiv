    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型是目前最为强大的机器学习模型之一，尤其是在提取重要特征方面表现出色。目前，大部分深度神经网络的设计参数仍需要手动调整，因此得到高性能的模型非常费时且时常不可能。优化深度网络参数需要更高收敛率的改进优化算法。而基于单一目标的优化方法通常耗时且不能在所有情况下保证最佳性能。包含多个需要同时优化的目标函数的数学优化问题属于多目标优化范畴，有时也被称为帕累托优化。多目标优化问题是参数优化的一种备选且实用的方案，但这个领域的研究还不够深入。本文将首先综述单一目标的深度学习优化技术，然后重点关注面向深度学习模型的多目标优化方法，同时提供多目标优化在深度学习中的挑战和未来方向的见解。",
