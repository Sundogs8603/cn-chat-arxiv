    "abstract": "We study the problem of approximate sampling from non-log-concave distributions, e.g., Gaussian mixtures, which is often challenging even in low dimensions due to their multimodality. We focus on performing this task via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods derived from discretizations of the overdamped Langevin diffusions, which are commonly known as Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms. Furthermore, we are also interested in two nonsmooth cases for which a large class of proximal MCMC methods have been developed: (i) a nonsmooth prior is considered with a Gaussian mixture likelihood; (ii) a Laplacian mixture distribution. Such nonsmooth and non-log-concave sampling tasks arise from a wide range of applications to Bayesian inference and imaging inverse problems such as image deconvolution. We perform numerical simulations to compare the performance of most commonly used Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了从非对数凸分布（例如高斯混合分布）进行近似抽样的问题。我们通过离散过度阻尼 Langevin 扩散所导出的马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗（MCMC）方法来解决这个问题，这些方法通常称为 Langevin Monte Carlo 算法。此外，我们还研究了两种非光滑情况，其中已经开发了大量的近端 MCMC 方法：(i) 考虑到非光滑的先验和高斯混合似然；(ii) 拉普拉斯混合分布。这样的非光滑和非对数凸采样任务源于广泛的贝叶斯推断和图像反问题，如图像反褶积中。我们进行了数值模拟以比较最常用的 Langevin Monte Carlo 算法的性能。",
