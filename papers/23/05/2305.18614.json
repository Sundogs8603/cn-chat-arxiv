To compensate for the scarcity of such training data, we propose a data augmentation method that generates artificial LUVT images by simulation and applies a style transfer to simulated LUVT images.The experimental results showed that the effectiveness of data augmentation based on the style-transformed simulated images improved the prediction performance of defects, rather than directly using the raw simulated images for data augmentation.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，激光超声可视化检测(LUVT)因其能够高效地进行非接触式超声无损检测而受到广泛关注。尽管基于深度学习的图像分析已经在各种领域获得了许多成功的报告，但是在LUVT图像的缺陷检测方面尝试应用深度学习面临着准备大规模的LUVT图像数据集的困难。为了弥补这种训练数据的稀缺性，我们提出了一种数据增强方法，通过模拟生成人工LUVT图像并对其应用风格转移。实验结果表明，基于风格转移的模拟图像数据增强方法比直接使用原始模拟图像的数据增强方法提高了缺陷预测的性能。",
