    "translated_abstract": "无监督聚类广泛用于探索大型语料库，但现有表述既不考虑用户的目标，也不解释聚类的含义。我们提出了一个新的任务形式——带解释的基于目标的聚类（GoalEx），它将目标和解释都表示为自由形式的语言描述。对于一个总结系统所犯的错误进行分类，GoalEx的输入是一个注释者为系统生成的摘要撰写的注释语料库和目标描述“根据注释者认为摘要不完美的原因对注释进行分类”;输出是每个具有解释的文本聚类(“此聚类提到摘要缺少重要的上下文信息。“)，这些聚类与目标相关，并准确解释哪些注释应该(不应该)属于一个聚类。为了解决GoalEx，我们使用一个语言模型提示“ [数据集子集]+[目标]+头脑风暴一个代表聚类的解释列表”，然后分类哪些解释属于每个聚类。实验在五个数据集上进行，包括汇总反馈、新闻文章、维基百科页面、科学文章和批评评论，展示了我们方法的有效性和生成的解释。",
