    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了有理性代理人在$t=0$时参与一份金融合同的情况，该合同的支付金额取决于$t=T$时的量子测量结果。假设已知量子系统的密度算符$ \\hat{p}$，那么代理人愿意在$t=0$时支付多少费用进入这样的一份合同？在有限维希尔伯特空间的情况下，每个索赔都可以用一个观测算符$\\hat{X}_T$来表示，其中$\\hat{X}_T$的特征值决定了测量结果，相应的支付金额与之对应。我们在合理的公理条件下证明了，存在一个定价状态$\\hat{q}$与物理状态$\\hat{p}$在零空间上等价，使得定价函数$\\Pi_{0T}$对于任何索赔$\\hat{X}_T$都采取形式$\\Pi_{0T}(\\hat{X}_T)=P_{0T} {\\rm tr}(\\hat{q}\\hat{X}_T)$，其中$P_{0T}$是一期折现因子。",
