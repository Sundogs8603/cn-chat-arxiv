    "translated_abstract": "Fourier神经算子（FNO）已成为非常受欢迎的机器学习体系结构，用于学习操作符，特别是那些在PDE中出现的操作符。然而，由于FNO依赖于快速傅里叶变换以实现计算效率，所以该体系结构可能仅限于笛卡尔网格上的输入数据。在这里，我们将FNO推广到处理分布在非均匀点分布上的输入数据。我们提出的模型称为Vandermonde神经运算符（VNO），利用Vandermonde结构矩阵来高效地计算正向和反向的傅里叶变换，即使在任意分布的点上也可以如此。我们进行了数值实验，证明VNO可以比FNO快得多，同时保持可比的准确性，并改进了可比的非均匀方法（如Geo-FNO）的准确性。",
