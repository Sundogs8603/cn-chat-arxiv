    "translated_abstract": "分布偏移(DS) 可以有两个层面：分布本身发生变化，支持（即概率密度非零的集合）也发生变化。当考虑训练和测试分布之间的支持变化时，有四种情况：（i）它们完全匹配；（ii）训练支持范围更广（因此覆盖测试支持）；（iii）测试支持范围更广；（iv）它们部分重叠。现有方法对情况（i）和（ii）很有效，而情况（iii）和（iv）现在更常见，但仍未得到充分探索。本文将重要性加权（IW）方法（用于情况（i）和（ii））推广为适用于所有情况的通用求解器。具体来说，我们首先研究了IW在情况（iii）和（iv）中可能失败的原因；基于这些发现，我们提出了泛化重要性加权（GIW），它可以处理情况（iii）和（iv），并且在情况（i）和（ii）中将减少为IW方法。在GIW中，将测试支持划分为训练内部（IT）部分和训练外部（OOT）部分，并为它们分配不同的权重。我们证明了在温和假设下，GIW对所有四种情况都收敛到最优解。我们在合成数据集和基准数据集上进行了广泛的实验证明，GIW确实在所有四种情况下优于现有方法。",
