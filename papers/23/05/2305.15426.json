    "translated_abstract": "在医疗保健中，准确分类医学图像至关重要，但传统的方法通常依赖于具有一致网格结构的医学数据，这可能限制了它们的整体性能。近期医学研究的重点是调整体系结构以获得更好的性能，而没有充分考虑数据的表述。在本文中，我们提出了一种将基于格点的数据转换为其更高维度表示的新方法，利用了无结构点云数据结构。我们首先通过将像素颜色信息作为空间坐标来从图像生成稀疏点云。接下来，我们构建了一个由点组成的超表面，基于图像尺寸，超表面内的每个平滑部分都表示特定的像素位置。多边形面构造是通过邻接张量完成的。最后，通过密集采样构造的超表面，生成了一个密集的点云，重点是重新采样以实现分类的最佳性能。",
