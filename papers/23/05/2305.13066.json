    "translated_abstract": "生物医学命名实体识别是生物医学自然语言处理中的核心任务之一。为了解决这个任务，已经提出了许多有监督/间接有监督的方法。尽管这些方法取得了显著的成功，但不可避免地需要大量的人力工作。为了减轻人力劳动的需求，已经提出了基于词典的方法，仅根据给定的词典提取命名实体。然而，现有的基于词典的方法的一个缺点是，它们难以识别给定词典中未列出的概念同义词，我们将其称为同义词泛化问题。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的同义词泛化（SynGen）框架，通过基于跨度的预测识别输入文本中包含的生物医学概念。具体而言，SynGen引入了两个正则化项，即（1）同义词距离正则化项；和（2）噪声扰动正则化项，以最小化",
