    "abstract": "Designing novel functional proteins remains a slow and expensive process due to a variety of protein engineering challenges; in particular, the number of protein variants that can be experimentally tested in a given assay pales in comparison to the vastness of the overall sequence space, resulting in low hit rates and expensive wet lab testing cycles. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning approach to novel protein design that aims to accelerate the expensive wet lab testing cycle and is capable of leveraging a training dataset that is both small and skewed ($\\approx 10^5$ datapoints, $< 1\\%$ positive hits). Our approach is composed of two parts: a semi-supervised transfer learning approach to generate a discrete fitness landscape for a desired protein function and a novel evolutionary Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling algorithm to more efficiently explore the fitness landscape. We demonstrate the performance of our approach by experimentally screening predicted high fitness gen",
