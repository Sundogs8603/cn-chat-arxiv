    "translated_abstract": "网络物理系统（CPS）是诸如电力网络或水力分配网络之类关键基础设施的支柱。这些系统的操作故障可能会对社会造成严重风险。为了避免或最小化停机时间，运营商需要实时了解关键事件。然而，CPS中的在线事件识别受到许多物理和数字组件相互依赖的复杂性的挑战，需要在同等考虑网络攻击和物理故障的情况下进行。在线事件识别问题由于缺乏对关键但罕见事件的历史观察以及网络攻击策略的不断演变而变得更加复杂。本文介绍并演示了CyPhERS，一种网络物理事件推理系统。CyPhERS提供关于CPS中的潜在关键事件发生、位置、物理影响和根本原因的实时信息，无需历史事件观察。 CyPhERS的关键特点包括其能够检测和诊断网络攻击和物理故障，其使用的新型事件推理算法以及其实时能力，可快速响应关键事件。",
