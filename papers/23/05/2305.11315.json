    "translated_abstract": "地理编码是将文本中的位置提及转换为编码地理空间语义的结构化数据的任务。我们提出了一种新的地理编码架构GeoNorm。GeoNorm首先使用信息检索技术从地理本体中生成候选条目列表，然后使用基于Transformer的神经网络从本体中获取信息(如条目人口)对候选条目进行重新排序。这个生成和重新排序过程应用了两次:首先解决不太含糊的国家，州和县，然后解决其余的位置提及，使用已确定的国家、州和县级信息作为上下文。我们提出的地名解析框架在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。代码和模型可在 \\url{https://github.com/clulab/geonorm}找到。",
