    "translated_abstract": "与发达市场不同，某些新兴市场由零售和非专业交易主导。过去20年中，中国A股市场是一个很好的典型。同时，许多研究表明，在中国A股市场中，专业投资者不断取得超过总市场指数的收益。具体而言，这种超额收益主要来自于股票选择能力而不是市场定时。然而，由于基金规模限制、基金经理变更或市场区域切换等原因，很难找到一个能够持续击败市场的基金。因此，为了从共同基金行业获得超额收益，我们使用量化的方法建立了以基金喜爱的股票为主的稀疏投资组合。首先，我们对共同基金喜爱的股票进行分析，并比较不同方法来构建我们的投资组合。然后，我们制定了一个具有约束的稀疏股票组合，其中包括个别股票和行业曝光的限制。",
