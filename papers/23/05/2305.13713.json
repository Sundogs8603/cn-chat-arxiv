    "title": "CALLS: Japanese Empathetic Dialogue Speech Corpus of Complaint Handling and Attentive Listening in Customer Center. (arXiv:2305.13713v1 [cs.SD])",
    "abstract": "We present CALLS, a Japanese speech corpus that considers phone calls in a customer center as a new domain of empathetic spoken dialogue. The existing STUDIES corpus covers only empathetic dialogue between a teacher and student in a school. To extend the application range of empathetic dialogue speech synthesis (EDSS), we designed our corpus to include the same female speaker as the STUDIES teacher, acting as an operator in simulated phone calls. We describe a corpus construction methodology and analyze the recorded speech. We also conduct EDSS experiments using the CALLS and STUDIES corpora to investigate the effect of domain differences. The results show that mixing the two corpora during training causes biased improvements in the quality of synthetic speech due to the different degrees of expressiveness. Our project page of the corpus is this http URL",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了CALLS，这是一个日语语音语料库，将客户中心中的电话呼叫称为共情口语对话的新领域。现有的STUDIES语料库仅涵盖学校教师和学生之间的共情对话。为了扩展共情对话语音合成（EDSS）的应用范围，我们设计了这个语料库，以包括与STUDIES教师相同的女性讲述者，在模拟的电话呼叫中担任操作员。我们描述了语料库构建方法，并分析了录制的语音。我们还使用CALLS和STUDIES语料库进行EDSS实验，以研究不同领域之间的影响。结果显示，在训练过程中混合两个语料库会导致合成语音质量的偏差改进，这是由于表现程度不同所导致的。本语料库的项目页面是http网址。",

Mixing the CALLS and STUDIES corpus during training causes biased improvements in synthetic speech quality due to different degrees of expressiveness. This corpus is significant for expanding the technology's application range."
