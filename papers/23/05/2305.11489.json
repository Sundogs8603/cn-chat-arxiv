All incomplete multi-view clustering methods need to address the problem of how to reduce the impact of missing views. To address this issue, we propose diffusion completion to recover the missing views integrated into an incomplete multi-view clustering framework. Based on the observable views information, the diffusion model is used to recover the missing views, and then the consistency information of the multi-view data is learned by contrastive learning to improve the performance of multi-view clustering. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first work to incorporate diffusion models into an incomplete multi-view clustering framework. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs well in recovering the missing views while achieving superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "在真实世界中，为了对大量未标记的数据进行有效的数据分析，不完整多视角聚类是一项具有挑战性和非常规的任务。所有的不完整多视角聚类方法都需要解决如何减少缺失视角的影响问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种扩散补全方法，将缺失视角恢复到不完整多视角聚类框架中。基于可观察视角信息，扩散模型用于恢复缺失的视角，然后通过对比学习来学习多视角数据的一致性信息，以提高多视角聚类的性能。据我们所知，这可能是将扩散模型纳入不完整多视角聚类框架的首个工作。实验结果表明，与最先进的方法相比，所提方法在恢复缺失的视角的同时实现了优越的聚类性能。",
