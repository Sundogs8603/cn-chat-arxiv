    "translated_abstract": "该研究首次引入了两种具有线性查询复杂度的常数近似算法来解决地面集合大小为$n$，在背包约束下的非单调子模最大化问题，分别为$\\mathsf{DLA}$和$\\mathsf{RLA}$。其中$\\mathsf{DLA}$是提供6+$\\epsilon$近似比的确定性算法，而$\\mathsf{RLA}$是具有4+$\\epsilon$近似比的随机算法。两种算法的查询复杂度均为$O(n \\log(1/\\epsilon)/\\epsilon)$。获取线性查询下的常数近似比的关键思想在于: (1)将地面集合分为两个合适的子集，用线性查询在这些子集中找到近似最优解，(2)将阈值贪心与两个不相交集合或随机选择进程的性质相结合，以提高解的质量。除了理论分析外，我们还使用三个应用程序评估了我们提出的解决方案：收入最大化，图像摘要。",
