    "abstract": "We introduce ZeroSCROLLS, a zero-shot benchmark for natural language understanding over long texts, which contains only test sets, without training or development data. We adapt six tasks from the SCROLLS benchmark, and add four new datasets, including two novel information fusing tasks, such as aggregating the percentage of positive reviews. Using ZeroSCROLLS, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both open-source and closed large language models, finding that Claude outperforms ChatGPT, and that GPT-4 achieves the highest average score. However, there is still room for improvement on multiple open challenges in ZeroSCROLLS, such as aggregation tasks, where models struggle to pass the naive baseline. As the state of the art is a moving target, we invite researchers to evaluate their ideas on the live ZeroSCROLLS leaderboard",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了 ZeroSCROLLS，这是一个用于长文本自然语言理解的零Shot基准测试，仅包含测试集而没有训练或开发数据。我们从SCROLLS基准测试中适应了六个任务，并添加了四个新数据集，包括两个新的信息融合任务，例如聚合正面评价的百分比。使用ZeroSCROLLS，我们对开源和闭源大型语言模型进行了全面评估，发现Claude优于ChatGPT，并且GPT-4获得了最高的平均分数。然而，在ZeroSCROLLS的多个开放挑战方面（例如，聚合任务），还有改进的空间，因为模型很难通过朴素的基准测试。由于最先进的技术还在不断更新，我们邀请研究人员在实时的ZeroSCROLLS排行榜上评估他们的想法。",
