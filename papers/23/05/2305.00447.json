    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse domains, thereby prompting researchers to explore their potential for use in recommendation systems. Initial attempts have leveraged the exceptional capabilities of LLMs, such as rich knowledge and strong generalization through In-context Learning, which involves phrasing the recommendation task as prompts. Nevertheless, the performance of LLMs in recommendation tasks remains suboptimal due to a substantial disparity between the training tasks for LLMs and recommendation tasks, as well as inadequate recommendation data during pre-training. To bridge the gap, we consider building a Large Recommendation Language Model by tunning LLMs with recommendation data. To this end, we propose an efficient and effective Tuning framework for Aligning LLMs with Recommendation, namely TALLRec. We have demonstrated that the proposed TALLRec framework can significantly enhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs in ",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）已经展现了在不同领域的显著性能，因此研究人员开始探索它们在推荐系统中的潜力。虽然初始的尝试已经利用了LLMs的优异能力，比如通过上下文学习中的提示词来丰富知识并进行强化泛化，但是由于LLMs的训练任务与推荐任务之间的巨大差异以及预训练期间的不足的推荐数据，LLMs在推荐任务中的性能仍然不理想。为了填补这一差距，我们考虑使用推荐数据对LLMs进行调整来构建大型推荐语言模型。为此，我们提出了一种名为TALLRec的高效且有效的调整框架，用于将LLMs与推荐系统对齐。我们已经证明了所提出的TALLRec框架可以显著增强LLMs在推荐任务中的能力。",
