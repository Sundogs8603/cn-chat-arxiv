    "abstract": "We describe how interpretable boosting algorithms based on ridge-regularized generalized linear models can be used to analyze high-dimensional environmental data. We illustrate this by using environmental, social, human and biophysical data to predict the financial vulnerability of farmers in Chile and Tunisia against climate hazards. We show how group structures can be considered and how interactions can be found in high-dimensional datasets using a novel 2-step boosting approach. The advantages and efficacy of the proposed method are shown and discussed. Results indicate that the presence of interaction effects only improves predictive power when included in two-step boosting. The most important variable in predicting all types of vulnerabilities are natural assets. Other important variables are the type of irrigation, economic assets and the presence of crop damage of near farms.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们阐述了如何使用基于岭正则化广义线性模型的解释性提升算法来分析高维环境数据。我们以智利和突尼斯的农民在面对气候灾害时的财务脆弱性为例，使用环境、社会、人类和生物物理数据进行预测。我们展示了如何考虑组结构以及如何在高维数据集中找到交互作用，使用一种新的两步提升方法。所提出方法的优点和功效都得到了实证和讨论。结果表明，在两步提升中引入交互作用可以提高预测能力。在预测所有类型的脆弱性方面，最重要的变量是自然资产。其他重要变量包括灌溉类型、经济资产和附近农场作物损坏的存在。",
