    "translated_abstract": "最近，张量环分解因其在高阶张量中的优越表现而受到越来越多的关注。然而，传统的张量环分解算法在面对大规模数据、缺失条目和异常值时，往往难以应用于现实世界的应用中。在本文中，我们提出了一种可扩展和健壮的张量环分解算法，能够处理大规模张量数据及其中的缺失条目和严重异常值。首先，我们开发了一种新颖的自适应加权最陡下降方法，在分解过程中能够自适应地填充缺失条目并识别异常值。此外，利用张量环模型，我们发展了一种新的快速 Gram 矩阵计算（FGMC）方法和一种随机子张量草图（RStS）策略，大幅度减少了存储和计算复杂度。实验结果表明，所提出的方法在张量环分解方面优于现有的方法。",
