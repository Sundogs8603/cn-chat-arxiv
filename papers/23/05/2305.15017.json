    "abstract": "Despite outstanding performance in many tasks, language models are notoriously inclined to make factual errors in tasks requiring arithmetic computation. We address this deficiency by creating Calc-X, a collection of datasets that demonstrates the appropriate use of a calculator in reasoning chains. Calc-X is suitable for teaching language models to offload computations to a symbolic system. We survey and unify several existing chain-of-thought datasets into a proposed format, resulting in a standard collection of over 300,000 samples requiring arithmetic reasoning. Finally, we use the new Calc-X collection to train open-source calculator-using models we call Calcformers and show that these models approximately double the accuracy of generating correct results compared to vanilla language model baselines. We make all Calc-X datasets, source code and Calcformers models publicly available.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管在许多任务中表现出色，但语言模型在需要进行算术计算的任务中往往会产生事实错误。为了解决这个问题，我们创建了Calc-X，这是一个演示如何在推理链中正确使用计算器的数据集合。Calc-X适用于教导语言模型将计算任务转移到符号系统中。我们调查并统一了几个已有的推理链数据集，并提出了一个标准格式，结果是一个包含超过30万个需要进行算术推理的样本的标准数据集合。最后，我们使用新的Calc-X集合来训练我们称之为Calcformers的开源计算器模型，并展示这些模型相对于普通语言模型基线生成正确结果的准确性近乎翻倍。我们公开提供所有的Calc-X数据集、源代码和Calcformers模型。",
