    "abstract": "Understanding the representations of different languages in multilingual language models is essential for comprehending their cross-lingual properties, predicting their performance on downstream tasks, and identifying any biases across languages. In our study, we analyze the geometry of three multilingual language models in Euclidean space and find that all languages are represented by unique geometries. Using a geometric separability index we find that although languages tend to be closer according to their linguistic family, they are almost separable with languages from other families. We also introduce a Cross-Lingual Similarity Index to measure the distance of languages with each other in the semantic space. Our findings indicate that the low-resource languages are not represented as good as high resource languages in any of the models",

    "translated_abstract": "理解多语言语言模型中不同语言的表示对于理解它们的跨语言属性、预测其在下游任务中的表现以及识别各种语言之间的任何偏见至关重要。在本研究中，我们在欧几里得空间中分析了三种多语言语言模型的几何，发现所有语言都由唯一的几何形状表示。通过使用几何可分离性指数，我们发现尽管语言往往根据它们的语言家族更加接近，但是它们几乎可以被从其他语言家族的语言分离出来。我们还引入了一个跨语言相似度指数来测量语义空间中语言之间的距离。我们的研究结果表明，在任何模型中，低资源语言的表示不如高资源语言的表示好。",
