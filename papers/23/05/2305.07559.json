    "abstract": "In a financial exchange, market impact is a measure of the price change of an asset following a transaction. This is an important element of market microstructure, which determines the behaviour of the market following a trade. In this paper, we first provide a discussion on the market impact observed in the BTC/USD Futures market, then we present a novel multi-agent market simulation that can follow an underlying price series, whilst maintaining the ability to reproduce the market impact observed in the market in an explainable manner. This simulation of the financial exchange allows the model to interact realistically with market participants, helping its users better estimate market slippage as well as the knock-on consequences of their market actions. In turn, it allows various stakeholders such as industrial practitioners, governments and regulators to test their market hypotheses, without deploying capital or destabilising the system.",

    "translated_abstract": "在金融交易所中，市场影响是衡量资产在交易后价格变化的一种指标。它是市场微观结构的重要组成部分，决定了交易后市场的行为。本文首先讨论了 BTC/USD 期货市场中观察到的市场影响，然后提出了一种新颖的多智能体市场模拟，可以跟踪基础价格系列，同时以可解释的方式重现市场观察到的市场影响。这种金融交易所的模拟使模型能够与市场参与者进行逼真的交互，帮助其用户更好地估计市场滑动以及其市场行动的连锁反应。反过来，它可以让各种利益相关者，如产业从业者、政府和监管机构测试其市场假设，而不需要投入资本或破坏系统。",
