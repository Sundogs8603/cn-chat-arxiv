To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised pseudo-label sampling method, TEMP, that can automatically assign potential safe responses.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人们对大规模对话系统的不安全响应生成越来越担忧，代理会从现实世界语料库中学习攻击性或有偏见的行为。提出了一些方法通过检测和替换不安全的训练样本来解决上述问题，虽然有效，但它们的注释成本高，并且在未见过的场景以及对抗性攻击方面适应性差。此外，忽略提供安全的响应（例如简单地替换模板）将导致对话信息缺失的问题。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种无监督的伪标签采样方法TEMP，可以自动分配潜在的安全响应。具体而言，我们的TEMP方法将响应分成几个簇，并使用一种自适应锐化采样策略进行多标签采样，灵感来自于不安全样本通常少且分布在尾部的观察。",
