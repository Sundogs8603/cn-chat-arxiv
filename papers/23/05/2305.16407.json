    "abstract": "The wide accessibility of social media has provided linguistically under-represented communities with an extraordinary opportunity to create content in their native languages. This, however, comes with certain challenges in script normalization, particularly where the speakers of a language in a bilingual community rely on another script or orthography to write their native language. This paper addresses the problem of script normalization for several such languages that are mainly written in a Perso-Arabic script. Using synthetic data with various levels of noise and a transformer-based model, we demonstrate that the problem can be effectively remediated. We conduct a small-scale evaluation of real data as well. Our experiments indicate that script normalization is also beneficial to improve the performance of downstream tasks such as machine translation and language identification.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体的广泛普及给语言代表性不充分的社区提供了以母语创作内容的卓越机会，然而，如果双语社区的语言使用者依赖其他书写该母语的文字或正字法来书写，那么就会涉及到一些脚本标准化的挑战。本文解决了使用合成数据和基于transformer的模型对主要使用波斯 - 阿拉伯文字书写的几种语言进行脚本标准化的问题，并进行了少量真实数据的评估。我们的实验结果表明，脚本标准化也有助于提高下游任务（如机器翻译和语言识别）的性能。",
