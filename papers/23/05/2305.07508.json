    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度生成模型在3D分子生成方面取得了优异性能。其中大多数模型首先生成原子，然后基于生成的原子以一种后处理的方式添加化学键。但是，由于生成的原子位置是在不考虑可能的键的情况下生成的，所以这些原子可能没有相应的键解决方案。我们将这个问题定义为原子键不一致性问题，并声称这是目前生成不逼真3D分子方法的主要原因。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的扩散模型，称为MolDiff，它可以同时生成原子和键，并通过显式地建模它们之间关系的依赖性来保持它们的一致性。我们使用与几何和化学属性相关的标准评估了我们提出的模型的生成能力和生成分子的质量。经验证实，我们的模型在生成高质量3D分子方面优于先前的方法。",
