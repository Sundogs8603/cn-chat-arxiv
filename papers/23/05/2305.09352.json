    "abstract": "This study is the first to investigate whether financial institutions for low-income populations have contributed to the historical decline in mortality rates. Using ward-level panel data from prewar Tokyo City, we found that public pawn loans were associated with reductions in infant and fetal death rates, potentially through improved nutrition and hygiene measures. Simple calculations suggest that popularizing public pawnshops led to a 6% and 8% decrease in infant mortality and fetal death rates, respectively, from 1927 to 1935. Contrarily, private pawnshops showed no significant association with health improvements. Our findings enrich the expanding literature on demographics and financial histories.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究是首次调查收入低下人口财务机构是否促进了历史性的死亡率下降。我们使用战前东京市的区级面板数据发现，公共当铺贷款与婴儿和胎儿死亡率的降低有关，可能是通过改善营养和卫生措施实现的。简单计算表明，从1927年到1935年推广公共当铺导致婴儿死亡率和胎儿死亡率分别下降了6%和8%。相反，私人当铺没有与健康改善的显着关联。我们的发现丰富了不断扩大的人口统计和金融历史文献。",
