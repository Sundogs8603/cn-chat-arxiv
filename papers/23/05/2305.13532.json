    "abstract": "Determining industry and product/service codes for a company is an important real-world task and is typically very expensive as it involves manual curation of data about the companies. Building an AI agent that can predict these codes automatically can significantly help reduce costs, and eliminate human biases and errors.

In this work, we propose a hierarchical multi-class industry code classifier with a targeted multi-label product/service code classifier leveraging advances in unsupervised representation learning techniques. We demonstrate how a high quality industry and product/service code classification system can be built using extremely limited labeled dataset. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of more than 20,000 companies and achieved a classification accuracy of more than 92\\%. Additionally, we also compared our approach",

    "translated_abstract": "确定公司的行业和产品/服务代码是一项重要的实际任务，通常费用很高，因为它涉及对公司数据的手动整理。构建一个可以自动预测这些代码的人工智能代理可以显著帮助减少成本，并消除人类偏见和错误。然而，标记数据集的不可用性以及在金融领域内需要高精度结果使得这是一个具有挑战性的问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种分层的多类行业代码分类器，其中包括一个针对多标签产品/服务代码分类器，利用了无监督表示学习技术的进展。我们展示了如何使用极少量的标记数据集构建高质量的行业和产品/服务代码分类系统。我们在超过20,000家公司的数据集上评估了我们的方法，并取得了超过92％的分类精度。此外，我们还比较了我们的方法...",
