    "translated_abstract": "矩阵流形，如对称正定（SPD）矩阵和Grassmann流形，出现在许多应用中。最近，通过应用陀螺群和陀螺矢量空间的理论——这是一个研究双曲几何的强大框架——一些工作尝试在矩阵流形上构建欧几里德神经网络的原则性推广。然而，由于缺乏考虑流形的内积和陀螺角等概念的陀螺矢量空间，相比于用于研究双曲几何的那些概念，这些工作提供的技术和数学工具仍然有限。在本文中，我们将陀螺矢量空间中的一些概念推广到SPD和Grassmann流形，并提出了在这些流形上构建神经网络的新模型和新层。我们展示了我们的方法在人类动作识别和知识图谱完成两个应用中的有效性。",
