    "abstract": "This work examines the presence of modularity in pre-trained Transformers, a feature commonly found in human brains and thought to be vital for general intelligence. In analogy to human brains, we consider two main characteristics of modularity: (1) functional specialization of neurons: we evaluate whether each neuron is mainly specialized in a certain function, and find that the answer is yes. (2) function-based neuron grouping: we explore finding a structure that groups neurons into modules by function, and each module works for its corresponding function. Given the enormous amount of possible structures, we focus on Mixture-of-Experts as a promising candidate, which partitions neurons into experts and usually activates different experts for different inputs. Experimental results show that there are functional experts, where clustered are the neurons specialized in a certain function. Moreover, perturbing the activations of functional experts significantly affects the corresponding f",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文研究了预训练Transformers中的模块化特征，这是人脑中常见的特点，被认为对于普遍智能至关重要。本文主要考虑了模块化的两个主要特征：（1）神经元的功能专业化：我们评估了每个神经元是否主要专业化于某一功能，结果表明是的。（2）基于功能聚类的神经元分组：我们探究了将神经元按功能分组的结构寻找方法，每个模块均为其相应功能工作。鉴于可能存在的大量结构，我们将重点放在了分层专家模型身上，并将神经元划分为专家，通常为不同的输入激活不同的专家。实验结果表明存在功能专家，聚集了某一功能的神经元。此外，扰动功能专家的激活显著影响了相应的f键",
