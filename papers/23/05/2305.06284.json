    "translated_abstract": "由于水资源供应不稳定和水质问题，可持续水资源管理已成为紧迫的挑战。气候变化的影响加剧了地中海地区等水资源匮乏地区的这一现象，刺激了旨在减轻或改善环境、社会和经济状况的解决方案的实施。一种灵感来自自然界、以技术为导向的新型解决方案是人工湿地。由于其低成本和简单的维护，常被应用于不同类型的废水处理，并被认为是除去污染物的有前途的解决方案，同时通过增加周围的生物多样性而创造了改进的生态系统。本研究旨在通过对意大利两个地区的两种类型的人工湿地（西西里岛的垂直地下流人工湿地和艾米利亚·罗马涅区的地表流人工湿地）进行可持续性评估，应用成本效益分析来比较这两种系统的经济、社会和环境影响。我们的研究结果表明，虽然两种系统都有积极的影响，但西西里岛的垂直地下流人工湿地具有更高的经济和社会效益，使其成为该地区水资源管理更可持续的选择。",
    "tldr": "本研究评估了两个不同地理区域的人工湿地的可持续性，结果表明西西里岛的垂直地下流人工湿地在经济和社会效益方面更高，是该地区水资源管理更可持续的选择。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study assessed the sustainability of two types of constructed wetlands in different regions of Italy and found that the vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland in Sicily has higher economic and social benefits, making it a more sustainable option for water management in the region."
