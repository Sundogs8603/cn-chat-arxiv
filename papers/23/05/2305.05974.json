    "translated_abstract": "Pearson-Matthews相关系数（通常缩写为MCC）被认为是用于二元分类或假设检验方法性能的最有用的指标之一（为了简洁，我们将始终使用分类术语，但本文中讨论的概念和方法完全适用于假设检验）。对于多元分类任务（具有两个以上的类），现有的MCC扩展通常称为$\\text{R}_{\\text{K}}$指标，在许多应用中也已经成功使用。本文首先介绍了MCC的某些方面，然后继续讨论本文的主要焦点——多元分类——尽管其在实践和理论上非常重要，但看起来没有二元分类主题那么发达。我们的$\\text{R}_{\\text{K}}$讨论后是引入另外两种用于多元分类的度量，分别为$\\text{MCC}_k$和$\\text{Q}_k$。该论文还提供了计算这些系数的实用建议，并提供了模拟结果，以说明它们的性能及其作为假设检验的适用性。",
