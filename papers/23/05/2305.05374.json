In this paper, we introduce a novel strategy to fully incorporate topological and geometrical features of circuits by making several key designs in our network architecture. To be more specific, we construct two individual graphs (geometry-graph, topology-graph) with distinct edge construction schemes according to their unique properties. We then propose a dual-branch network with different encoder layers in each pathway and aggregate representations with a sophisticated fusion strategy. Our network, named HybridNet, not only provides a simple yet effective way to capture the geometric interactions of cells, but also preserves the original topological relationships in the netlist. Experimental results on the ISPD2015 benchmarks show that we achieve an improvement of 10.9% compared to previous methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "准确的阻塞预测是帮助设计师在VLSI设计周期内更快迭代的重要环节，而本文提出了一种新的策略，通过在网络结构中做出几个关键设计，充分综合电路的拓扑与几何特征。具体来说，我们构建了两个独立的图（几何图、拓扑图），根据它们的唯一属性采用不同的边缘构建方案。然后，我们提出了一个双分支网络，每个路径中都有不同的编码器层，并通过精细的融合策略进行聚合表示。我们的网络名为HybridNet，不仅提供了一种简单而有效的方法来捕捉单元之间的几何交互，而且还保留了原始电路拓扑关系。在ISPD2015基准测试上的实验结果显示，相较于以往方法，我们取得了10.9％的提高。",
