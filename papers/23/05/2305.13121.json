    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate how transformational leadership affects team processes, mediated by change in team members. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to construction project team members in Abuja and Kaduna, and statistical analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between transformational leadership and team processes, transformational leadership and change in team members, changes in team members and team processes, and changes in team members mediating the relationship between transformational leadership and team processes. Future studies should consider cultural differences.",
