    "abstract": "Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) is a task to find the image that most accurately depicts the correct sense of the target word for the given context. Previously, image-text matching models often suffered from recognizing polysemous words. This paper introduces an unsupervised VWSD approach that uses gloss information of an external lexical knowledge-base, especially the sense definitions. Specifically, we suggest employing Bayesian inference to incorporate the sense definitions when sense information of the answer is not provided. In addition, to ameliorate the out-of-dictionary (OOD) issue, we propose a context-aware definition generation with GPT-3. Experimental results show that the VWSD performance significantly increased with our Bayesian inference-based approach. In addition, our context-aware definition generation achieved prominent performance improvement in OOD examples exhibiting better performance than the existing definition generation method.

    "translated_abstract": "视觉词义消歧是一项任务，旨在找到最准确地描述给定上下文中目标词正确意义的图像。以往的图像-文本匹配模型往往受到词义多义性的影响。本文介绍了一种无监督的视觉词义消歧方法，该方法使用了外部词汇知识库的词汇信息，特别是词义定义。具体而言，我们建议在没有提供答案的词义信息时，采用贝叶斯推断来加入词义定义。此外，为了改进词典外问题，我们提出了一种与上下文相关的GPT-3定义生成方法。实验结果表明，我们的基于贝叶斯推断的方法明显提高了视觉词义消歧的性能。此外，我们的上下文相关定义生成方法在词典外例子上取得了显著的性能提升，表现优于现有的定义生成方法。",
