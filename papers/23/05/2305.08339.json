    "translated_abstract": "基于大语言模型（LLMs）的聊天机器人在语言理解方面表现出很强的能力。本研究探索LLMs在协助基于语料库的语言学研究方面的潜力，通过将文本自动标注为特定语言信息类别。具体而言，我们研究了从本地语法的角度观察道歉言语行为构成的功能元素的程度，通过比较基于GPT-3.5的ChatGPT、基于GPT-4的Bing聊天机器人和人类编码器在注释任务中的表现。结果表明，Bing聊天机器人在任务中表现显着优于ChatGPT。与人类标注员相比，Bing聊天机器人的整体表现略低于人类标注员的表现，但已经取得了较高的F1得分:道歉标记99.95％，原因标记91.91％，道歉者标记95.35％，被道歉者标记89.74％和加强标记96.47％。这表明，在语言类别清晰且可以轻松识别的情况下，使用LLM辅助注释进行语料库语言学研究是可行的。",
