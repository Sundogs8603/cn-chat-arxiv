    "abstract": "Speech AI Technologies are largely trained on publicly available datasets or by the massive web-crawling of speech. In both cases, data acquisition focuses on minimizing collection effort, without necessarily taking the data subjects' protection or user needs into consideration. This results to models that are not robust when used on users who deviate from the dominant demographics in the training set, discriminating individuals having different dialects, accents, speaking styles, and disfluencies. In this talk, we use automatic speech recognition as a case study and examine the properties that ethical speech datasets should possess towards responsible AI applications. We showcase diversity issues, inclusion practices, and necessary considerations that can improve trained models, while facilitating model explainability and protecting users and data subjects. We argue for the legal & privacy protection of data subjects, targeted data sampling corresponding to user demographics & needs, ",

    "translated_abstract": "语音AI技术主要是通过公开数据集或者大规模网络爬虫来进行训练的。在这两种情况下，数据采集都致力于最小化收集工作，但却没有对数据主体的保护或用户需求进行考虑。这导致模型在处理不符合训练集中主导族群的用户时不够强健，歧视使用不同方言、口音、说话风格和语言障碍的个体。本研究以自动语音识别为案例研究，探讨伦理语音数据集应具备的性质，以确保人工智能应用的责任性。我们展示了多样性问题、包容性做法和必要的考虑因素，以改善训练模型，同时促进模型可解释性和数据主体的保护。我们主张对数据主体进行法律和隐私保护，针对用户的族群和需求进行有针对性的数据采样。",
