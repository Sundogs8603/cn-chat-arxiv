    "translated_abstract": "本文提出的模型中，参与者根据自身战略选择风险水平并获得相应回报，模拟了各行业之间的现实竞争。我们从一个涉及两名玩家在连续行动空间内的正态形式博弈开始分析，证实了Nash均衡的存在和唯一性，并给出了分析解。然后，我们将这种分析扩展到多人游戏情境，并引入了一种新的数值算法进行计算。我们研究的一个关键创新点是使用后悔最小化算法通过离散化来解决连续博弈问题。这种开创性的方法使我们能够将市场摩擦和公司间风险相关性等额外的现实因素纳入考虑。我们还通过实验验证了我们模型中的Nash均衡也可以用作相关均衡。我们的研究揭示了市场摩擦和风险相关性如何影响战略性风险承受。我们还探讨了政策措施如何影响市场风险。",
