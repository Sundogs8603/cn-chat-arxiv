    "translated_abstract": "恶意软件开放集识别（MOSR）旨在同时对来自已知家族的恶意软件样本进行分类并检测来自新未知家族的样本。现有的方法大多依赖于经过良好训练的分类器，考虑每个已知家族的预测概率并使用基于阈值的检测来实现MOSR。但是，我们的观察结果表明，恶意软件样本的特征分布非常相似，甚至在已知和未知家族之间也是如此。因此，获得的分类器可能会在向已知家族测试未知样本时产生过高的概率，从而降低模型性能。在本文中，我们提出了多模态双嵌入网络，称为MDENet，利用来自不同模态的综合恶意软件特征（即恶意软件图片和恶意软件句子）来增强恶意软件特征空间的多样性，这更具代表性和区分性，以供下游识别使用。最后，为了进一步保证MDENet的稳健性，我们引入了一种新的训练策略，生成更强大的未知样本作为真实未知家族的代理。在两个公开可用的数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的MDENet方法优于现有最先进的方法。",
