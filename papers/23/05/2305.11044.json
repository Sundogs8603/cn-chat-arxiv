    "abstract": "Recommender systems influence almost every aspect of our digital lives. Unfortunately, in striving to give us what we want, they end up restricting our open-mindedness. Current recommender systems promote echo chambers, where people only see the information they want to see, and homophily, where users of similar background see similar content. We propose a new serendipity metric to measure the presence of echo chambers and homophily in recommendation systems using cluster analysis. We then attempt to improve the diversity-preservation qualities of well known recommendation techniques by adopting a parent selection algorithm from the evolutionary computation literature known as lexicase selection. Our results show that lexicase selection, or a mixture of lexicase selection and ranking, outperforms its purely ranked counterparts in terms of personalization, coverage and our specifically designed serendipity benchmark, while only slightly under-performing in terms of accuracy (hit rate).

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统影响着我们数字生活的方方面面。不幸的是，在努力满足我们需求的过程中，它们限制了我们的开放度。当前的推荐系统促进了回声室和同质化，使用户只看到他们想要看到的信息和与其背景相似的内容。我们提出了一种新的机遇性度量方法，使用聚类分析来衡量推荐系统中回声室和同质化的存在。然后，我们尝试采用从演化计算文献中知名的家长选择算法，即词典案例选择，来改善保留多样性的推荐技术质量。我们的结果表明，词典案例选择或词典案例选择和排名的混合在个性化、覆盖面和我们专门设计的机遇性基准方面优于仅排名的对手，而在准确性（命中率）方面仅稍有不足。",
