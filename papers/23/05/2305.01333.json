With this general template, we deduce sublinear regret and constraint violation bounds for various settings.

    "translated_abstract": "该论文提出了一种用于带有随机约束的在线凸优化的无投影算法。我们设计了一个在线原始-对偶无投影框架，该框架可以采用任何用于在线凸优化的无长期约束的无投影算法。使用该模板，我们推导出各种情况下的亚线性遗憾和约束违规边界。此外，对于损失函数和约束函数都光滑的情况，我们开发了一种原始-对偶条件梯度方法，实现了$O(\\sqrt{T})$的遗憾和 $O(T^{3/4})$的约束违规。此外，对于损失函数和约束函数都是随机的情况，并且与关联的离线随机优化问题存在强对偶性的情况，我们证明了约束违规可以被减少到与遗憾有相同的渐近增长。",

It also presents a primal-dual conditional gradient method for smooth loss and constraint functions, and proves that constraint violation can be reduced to grow asymptotically the same as regret in the case of stochastic functions with strong duality."
