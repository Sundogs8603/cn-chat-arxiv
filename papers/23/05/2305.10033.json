    "translated_abstract": "求解偏微分方程（PDE）一直是计算科学的基本问题，也是科学和工程研究的广泛应用领域。由于神经网络具有通用逼近性，因此广泛用于逼近PDE的解。然而，由于高阶导数的计算精度不足，现有方法无法解决高阶PDE，并且所得到的网络是一个没有明确解释的黑盒子。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种名为SHoP的深度学习框架，用于解决高阶PDE。具体而言，我们推导了神经网络的高阶导数规则，以便快速准确地获得导数；此外，我们把网络展开成泰勒级数，为PDE提供了一个明确的解决方案。我们对不同维度的四个高阶PDE进行了实验验证，表明我们可以高效而准确地解决高阶PDE。",
