    "abstract": "Existing models in cognitive science typically assume human categorization as graded generalization behavior in a multidimensional psychological space. However, category representations in these models may suffer from the curse of dimensionality in a natural setting. People generally rely on a tractable yet sufficient set of features to understand the complex environment. We propose a rational model of categorization based on a hierarchical mixture of probabilistic principal components, that simultaneously learn category representations and an economical collection of features. The model captures dimensional biases in human categorization and supports zero-shot learning. We further exploit a generative process within a low-dimensional latent space to provide a better account of categorization with high-dimensional stimuli. We validate the model with simulation and behavioral experiments.",

    "translated_abstract": "认知科学中现有的模型通常假设人类在心理空间中进行分级概括行为，但是在自然环境中，这些模型中的类别表示可能会受到维度诅咒的影响。人们一般依赖于一组可行但足够的特征来理解复杂的环境。本文提出了一个基于层次化概率主成分混合模型的分类模型，同时学习类别表示和经济的特征集合。该模型捕捉了人类分类中的维度偏差并支持零-shot学习。我们进一步在低维潜在空间内利用生成过程，提供高维刺激下更好的分类解释。我们通过模拟和行为实验验证了模型。",
