    "translated_abstract": "记录链接是定量社会科学的基石，因为分析通常需要链接来自多个嘈杂的来源的数据。现成的字符串匹配方法被广泛使用，因为它们易于实现和扩展。然而，并非所有字符替换的概率都相等，在某些情况下，有一些常用的手工制作的列表，用来表示哪些字符串替换更有可能，从而提高字符串匹配的准确性。但是，对于许多情况，这样的清单并不存在，从而使得具有链接数据集的研究向少数高资源的背景倾斜，这些背景并不代表人类社会的多样性。本研究开发了一种可扩展的方法，通过使用经过增强的数字字体进行大规模自监督训练的Vision Transformers（ViT），来测量OCR文档的字符替换成本。对于每一种使用CJK脚本编写的语言，我们对相同字符的不同增强进行对比学习度量空间，从而量化字符的相似性。",
