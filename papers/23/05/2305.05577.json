    "translated_abstract": "机器学习技术在材料建模中的应用通常涉及到已知对特定对称性具有等变或不变性的函数。虽然图神经网络在这些任务中已被证明是成功的，但它们通过模型架构来强制实现对称性，这通常会降低它们的表现力、可扩展性和可理解性。在本文中，我们引入了一个灵活的框架，通过随机帧平均（SFA）从而通过数据变换使任何模型 E(3) 等变或不变. 同时我们还引入了FAENet，它是一个简单、快速且表现力强的 GNN，通过优化 SFA，以没有任何对称性约束的方式处理几何信息。我们在OC20数据集（S2EF，IS2RE）以及常见的分子建模任务（QM9，QM7-X）上从理论和实验证明了我们方法的有效性、超强的准确性和可扩展性。具有示例实现的软件包可在 https://faenet.readthedocs.io获得。",
