    "translated_abstract": "神经网络具有超越神经元数量的表示特征的能力，这使得解释它们变得具有挑战性。这种现象被称为叠加效应，已经激发了寻找比具有元素级激活函数的标准多层感知器（MLP）更易于解释的架构的努力。在这个注释中，我研究了双线性层，这是一种数学上更容易分析而且同时表现比标准 MLP 更好的 MLP 层的类型。虽然它们是其输入的非线性函数，但我证明双线性层可以仅使用线性操作和三阶张量来表示。我们可以将双线性层的这种表达式集成到转换器电路的数学框架中，该数学框架以前仅适用于仅具有注意力的转换器。这些结果表明，相对于当前的架构，双线性层数学上更易于分析，因此可能通过允许我们更深入地讨论来为更深入的安全洞察力作出贡献。",
