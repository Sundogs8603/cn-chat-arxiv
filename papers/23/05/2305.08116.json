Within such graphs, each relationship between two nodes represents a basic fact involving these two entities. The diversity of the semantics of relationships constitutes the richness of knowledge graphs, leading to the emergence of singular topologies, sometimes chaotic in appearance. However, this complex characteristic can be modeled in a simple way by introducing the concept of superficiality, which controls the overlap between relationships whose facts are generated independently. Superficiality also regulates the balance of the global distribution of knowledge by determining the proportion of misdescribed entities.

    "translated_abstract": "大型知识图谱综合了从学术机构和企业到大众集资等项目中获得的人类知识，每两个节点之间的关系代表这两个实体之间的基本事实。关系语义的多样性组成了知识图谱的丰富性，导致出现有时混乱的奇异拓扑结构。然而，这种复杂特征可以通过引入表层性的概念来简单建模，表层性控制着独立生成事实的关系之间的重叠情况，也通过确定错误描述实体的比例来控制全局知识分布的平衡。这是知识图谱结构和动态方面的首个模型，有助于更好地理解正式知识获取和组织。",
