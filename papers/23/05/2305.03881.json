    "translated_abstract": "多模式搜索引擎近年来经历了显著的增长和广泛的使用，成为继信息检索之后第二常见的互联网使用方式。尽管搜索引擎系统提供了一系列服务，但图像搜索领域最近成为信息检索社区的焦点，因为常言道“一图胜千言”。虽然像谷歌这样的流行搜索引擎在图像搜索精度和敏捷性方面表现出色，但人们对它们的搜索结果是否会存在性别、语言、人口统计、社会文化方面的偏见存在争议。这种潜在的偏见可能会对个人的认知产生重要影响，并影响他们的视角。本文主要研究网络搜索中的偏见和公平性问题，重点关注基于关键字的图像搜索方面。我们首先讨论了搜索系统中存在的几种偏见类型以及为什么有必要加以缓解。我们将研究重点缩小到评估和缓解图像检索中的职业模式刻板印象。我们的实验表明，当前的图像搜索引擎存在相当严重的职业模式刻板印象，这可能对个人和整个社会产生不利影响。我们提出了一种去偏见方法，以减轻此类偏见并提高图像搜索引擎的公平性。",

The study shows that current image search engines exhibit considerable occupational stereotyping, and proposes a debiasing approach to mitigate such biases and improve the fairness of image search engines."
