Developing these LLMs involves a complex yet poorly understood workflow requiring training with human feedback. Replicating and understanding this instruction-following process faces three major challenges: the high cost of data collection, the lack of trustworthy evaluation, and the absence of reference method implementations. We address these challenges with AlpacaFarm, a simulator that enables research and development for learning from feedback at a low cost. First, we design LLM prompts to simulate human feedback that are 45x cheaper than crowdworkers and display high agreement with humans. Second, we propose an automatic evaluation and validate it against human instructions obtained on real-world interactions. Third, we contribute reference implementations for several methods (PPO, best-of-n, expert iteration, and more) that learn from pairwise feedback",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT因其良好的指令跟随能力而得到了广泛应用。开发这些LLMs需要使用人类反馈进行训练的复杂且尚不明确的工作流程。将此指令跟随过程复制和理解面临三大挑战： 数据收集的高昂成本，缺乏可信的评估和缺乏参考方法实现。我们通过AlpacaFarm解决了这些挑战，这是一个低成本的模拟器，可用于从反馈中学习的研究和开发。第一，我们设计了LLM提示来模拟人类反馈，其成本比众包工作者便宜45倍，并且与人类反馈具有高度一致性。第二，我们提出了一种自动评估方法，并将其与真实世界交互中获得的人类指令进行验证。第三，我们为几种从配对反馈中学习的方法（PPO，best-of-n，expert iteration等）提供了参考实现。",
