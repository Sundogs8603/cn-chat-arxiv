    "abstract": "With a fast developing pace of geographic applications, automatable and intelligent models are essential to be designed to handle the large volume of information. However, few researchers focus on geographic natural language processing, and there has never been a benchmark to build a unified standard. In this work, we propose a GeoGraphic Language Understanding Evaluation benchmark, named GeoGLUE. We collect data from open-released geographic resources and introduce six natural language understanding tasks, including geographic textual similarity on recall, geographic textual similarity on rerank, geographic elements tagging, geographic composition analysis, geographic where what cut, and geographic entity alignment. We also pro vide evaluation experiments and analysis of general baselines, indicating the effectiveness and significance of the GeoGLUE benchmark.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着地理应用的快速发展，自动化和智能化的模型是处理大量信息的必要条件。然而，很少有研究者关注地理自然语言处理，也从未建立过一个统一的标准。在这项研究中，我们提出了一个名为GeoGLUE的地理语言理解评估基准。我们从公开发布的地理资源收集数据，并引入六个自然语言理解任务，包括基于回调的地理文本相似度、基于重新排序的地理文本相似度、地理元素标记、地理组合分析、地理何处分离、地理实体对齐。我们还提供了评估实验和一般性基线的分析，表明GeoGLUE基准的有效性和重要性。",
