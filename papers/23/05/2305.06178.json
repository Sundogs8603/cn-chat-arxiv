    "translated_abstract": "多物体导航 (MultiON) 任务要求机器人定位多种物体类别的实例。这是家庭或工厂辅助机器人的基本任务。已有的 MultiON 方法将此视为对象导航 (ON) 的直接扩展，即本文所述的 ON 任务需要提前指定探索对象类别的顺序。这在动态变化的实际应用中具有很大的局限性。本文描述了一种基于演员-评论家体系结构和适当的奖励规范的深度强化学习框架，用于无序 MultiON。我们的框架利用过去的经验，并试图奖励单个和多个目标对象类别的进展。我们在 AI Habitat 3D 模拟环境中使用 Gibson 基准数据集中的照片逼真场景进行实验，结果表明我们的方法性能更好。",
