    "translated_abstract": "CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)分解是在多域大规模多输入多输出（MIMO）系统中表述接收到的张量信号的最常用模型，因为接收机通常会将来自不同传输路径或用户的组件相加。为了实现准确和低延迟的信道估计，需要好的、快速的CP分解算法。CP交替最小二乘法（CPALS）是计算CP分解的主力算法。但是，它的性能取决于初始化，良好的起始值可以导致更有效的解决方案。现有的初始化策略与CPALS解耦，并不一定有利于解决CP分解问题。为了提高算法的速度和精度，本文提出了一种基于深度学习的CPALS（DL-CPALS）方法，它使用深度神经网络（DNN）生成有利的初始化。所提出的DL-CPALS将DNN和CPALS集成到模型基深度学习范式中。",
