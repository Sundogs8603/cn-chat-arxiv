    "abstract": "A legal document is usually long and dense requiring human effort to parse it. It also contains significant amounts of jargon which make deriving insights from it using existing models a poor approach. This paper presents the approaches undertaken to perform the task of rhetorical role labelling on Indian Court Judgements as part of SemEval Task 6: understanding legal texts, shared subtask A. We experiment with graph based approaches like Graph Convolutional Networks and Label Propagation Algorithm, and transformer-based approaches including variants of BERT to improve accuracy scores on text classification of complex legal documents.",

    "translated_abstract": "通常，法律文件冗长而密集，需要人力成本来解析。此外，法律文件还包含大量行话术语，使用现有模型来从中获得洞察的方法表现不佳。本文介绍了在 SemEval Task 6: understanding legal texts, shared subtask A 的印度法院判决中进行修辞角色标注任务所采用的方法。我们尝试了基于图的方法，如图卷积网络和标签传播算法，以及基于Transformer的方法，包括BERT的变体，以提高针对复杂法律文件的文本分类的准确性分数。",
