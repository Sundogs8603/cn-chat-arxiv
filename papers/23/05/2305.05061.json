    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型，如生成式预训练变形器（GPT），在各种语言任务中取得了巨大成功，但它们新兴的能力也引发了许多需要解决的问题、关注和挑战。为了更好地理解这些模型的内部机制，我们分析了小型GPT中的隐藏状态和通道波动机制，重点关注交叉通道相关性和个体自相关性方面的波动模式的一致性。我们的研究表明，波动动力学提供了一致和可重复的内在振荡模式，以及上下文感知的可塑性和表现力，可用于语言生成。通过分析波动模式、相干性和聚类，我们提供了一种系统的方法来识别和解释隐藏状态通道的功能，为理解和控制更高级别的语言模式形成铺平了道路。此外，我们研究了拼写错误的泊松统计。",
