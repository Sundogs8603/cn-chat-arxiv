    "translated_abstract": "联邦噪声标签学习(FNLL)正在成为一种有前途的隐私保护的多源分散学习工具。现有研究基于全局数据类别平衡的假设，可能无法建模复杂的标签噪声，特别是在医学场景中。本文首先提出了一个更为真实的联邦标签噪声问题，其中全局数据是类别不平衡的，并且标签噪声是异质的，然后提出了一个名为 FedNoRo 的两阶段框架，用于噪声-鲁棒联邦学习。具体而言，在 FedNoRo 的第一阶段，采用每类损失指标之后跟随高斯混合模型进行嘈杂客户端识别。在第二阶段，同时采用知识蒸馏和距离感知聚合函数进行噪声-鲁棒联邦模型更新。对广泛使用的 ICH 和 ISIC2019 数据集的实验结果表明，FedNoRo 相对于最先进的 FNLL 方法在解决联邦学习中的类别不平衡和标签噪声异质性方面具有卓越的性能。",
