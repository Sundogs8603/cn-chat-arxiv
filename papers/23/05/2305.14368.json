    "abstract": "Stock trend analysis has been an influential time-series prediction topic due to its lucrative and inherently chaotic nature. Many models looking to accurately predict the trend of stocks have been based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). However, due to the limitations of RNNs, such as gradient vanish and long-term dependencies being lost as sequence length increases, in this paper we develop a Transformer based model that uses technical stock data and sentiment analysis to conduct accurate stock trend prediction over long time windows. This paper also introduces a novel dataset containing daily technical stock data and top news headline data spanning almost three years. Stock prediction based solely on technical data can suffer from lag caused by the inability of stock indicators to effectively factor in breaking market news. The use of sentiment analysis on top headlines can help account for unforeseen shifts in market conditions caused by news coverage. We measure the performance",

    "translated_abstract": "股票趋势分析是一个有影响力的时间序列预测主题，由于其利润丰厚且内在混乱的特性而受到关注。许多旨在准确预测股票趋势的模型都基于循环神经网络（RNN）。然而，由于RNN的限制，如梯度消失和长期依赖关系随着序列长度的增加而丢失，本文开发了一种基于Transformer的模型，使用技术股票数据和情感分析，实现了对长时间窗口内股票趋势的准确预测。本文还介绍了一个新颖的数据集，其中包含了近三年的每日技术股票数据和头条新闻数据。仅基于技术数据的股票预测可能会受到滞后的影响，因为股票指标无法有效地因应市场新闻的变化。使用情感分析来分析头条新闻可以帮助应对由新闻报道引起的市场条件的不可预见的变化。我们衡量了模型的性能。",
