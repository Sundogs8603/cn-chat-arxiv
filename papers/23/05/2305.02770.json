    "abstract": "The use of language is innately political and often a vehicle of cultural identity as well as the basis for nation building. Here, we examine language choice and tweeting activity of Ukrainian citizens based on more than 4 million geo-tagged tweets from over 62,000 users before and during the Russian-Ukrainian War, from January 2020 to October 2022. Using statistical models, we disentangle sample effects, arising from the in- and outflux of users on Twitter, from behavioural effects, arising from behavioural changes of the users. We observe a steady shift from the Russian language towards the Ukrainian language already before the war, which drastically speeds up with its outbreak. We attribute these shifts in large part to users' behavioural changes. Notably, we find that many Russian-tweeting users perform a hard-switch to Ukrainian as a result of the war.",

    "translated_abstract": "语言使用天生是政治的，并经常用作文化身份的载体，同时也是国家建设的基础。本文研究了俄乌战争期间（2020年1月至2022年10月），基于超过62,000位用户发布的400万条地理标记推文中，乌克兰公民的语言选择和推文活动。使用统计模型，区分了Twitter上用户的流入流出所引起的样本效应和用户行为变化所引起的行为效应。我们观察到，在战争爆发之前已经有一个稳定的从俄语向乌克兰语的转变，而这一过程在战争爆发后迅速加速。我们将这些变化主要归因于用户行为的改变。值得注意的是，许多使用俄语的用户在战争期间会转变成使用乌克兰语。",
