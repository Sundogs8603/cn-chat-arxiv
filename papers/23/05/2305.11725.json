    "translated_abstract": "回答涉及文本和表格混合事实知识的多跳问题(TextTableQA)是一项具有挑战性的任务。现有模型主要采用检索器-阅读器框架，存在几个问题，如训练检索器的嘈杂标签、对文本和表格的异构信息利用不足以及不同推理操作能力不足。本文提出了一个三阶段文本表格问答框架S3HQA，包括检索器、选择器和推理器。我们采用一个训练精细的检索器来解决嘈杂标签的问题。然后，使用一个混合选择器来考虑异构数据之间的链接关系，以选择最相关的实际知识。在最后一个阶段，我们采用一个基于生成的推理器来获取答案，而不是像之前的方法一样使用阅读理解模块。其中包括两种方法：一种是按行生成器，一种是LLM提示生成器（在这个任务中第一次使用）。在WikiTableQuestions和ComplexWebQuestions数据集上的实验结果显示，我们的S3HQA实现了最先进的性能，并在很大程度上优于以前的方法。",

It achieves state-of-the-art performance in WikiTableQuestions and ComplexWebQuestions datasets, outperforming previous approaches by a significant margin."
