The dataset challenges models to match multiple constraints mentioned in queries with corresponding evidence in documents and correctly perform various set operations.

    "translated_abstract": "为满足有选择性的信息需求，我们可以使用隐式集合操作，例如交集、并集和差集。研究检索系统满足这种信息需求的能力，我们构建了QUEST数据集，其中包含3357个自然语言查询，这些查询具有隐式集合操作，同时对应于维基百科文档中的实体集。该数据集要求模型将查询中提到的多个约束条件与文档中相应的证据相匹配，并正确执行各种集合操作。该数据集是半自动构建的，使用维基百科类别名称自动组合查询，然后由众包工作者对其进行释义和自然度验证。众包工作者还根据文档评估实体的相关性，并突出显示查询的属性。",
