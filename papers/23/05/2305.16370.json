    "translated_abstract": "多元长期时间序列预测在诸多领域中具有重要应用，如能源消耗和天气预报等。随着基于变压器的方法的发展，多元长期时间序列预测的性能得到了显著提高，但变压器模型中对于空间特征的研究较少，而不同预测周期之间的一致性也由于时间跨度较大而不尽人意。本文提出了一种完整的解决方案，以解决特征提取和目标预测方面的问题。对于特征提取，我们设计了一种有效的空间-时间编码器，包括半自适应图形来获取足够的空间-时间信息。对于预测，我们提出了级联解码预测器（CDP），以加强不同间隔之间的相关性，也可以用作通用的组件来提高基于变压器的方法的性能。所提出的方法称为Stecformer，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并为多元长期时间序列预测提供了一种有前途的方法。",
