    "translated_abstract": "抽象相关工作生成吸引了越来越多的关注，其生成的连贯相关工作更有助于读者了解当前研究的背景。然而，大多数现有的抽象模型忽略了相关工作生成的内在因果关系，导致生成的相关工作质量低下，出现虚假相关性，影响模型的普适性。本研究认为因果干预可以解决这些限制，并提高生成的相关工作的质量和连贯性。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的相关工作生成因果干预模块（CaM），以有效地捕捉生成过程中的因果关系，并提高生成的相关工作的质量和连贯性。具体而言，我们首先使用因果图模型化相关工作生成中句子顺序、文档关系和过渡内容之间的关系。然后，为了实现因果干预并缓解虚假相关性的负面影响，我们引入反事实干预的概念，并设计了一个新的模块来有效地干预因果图。实验结果表明，我们提出的模型在质量和连贯性方面优于现有的抽象相关工作生成模型。",

By simulating the relationships among sentence order, document relation, and transitional content using a causal graph and implementing counterfactual intervention to mitigate spurious correlations, the proposed model outperforms existing models in terms of quality and coherence."
