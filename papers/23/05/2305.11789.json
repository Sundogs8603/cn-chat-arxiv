    "abstract": "Humans work together to solve common problems by having discussions, explaining, and agreeing or disagreeing with each other. Similarly, if a system can have discussions with humans when solving tasks, it can improve the system's performance and reliability. In previous research on explainability, it has only been possible for the system to make predictions and for humans to ask questions about them rather than having a mutual exchange of opinions. This research aims to create a dataset and computational framework for systems that discuss and refine their predictions through dialogue. Through experiments, we show that the proposed system can have beneficial discussions with humans improving the accuracy by up to 25 points in the natural language inference task.",

    "translated_abstract": "人类通过讨论、解释并相互赞同或反对等方式共同解决共同问题。同样，如果系统在解决任务时能与人类进行讨论，它可以提高系统的性能和可靠性。在之前的可解释性研究中，系统只能做出预测，人类只能就这些预测提问，而没有彼此间的意见交换。本研究旨在创建一个数据集和计算框架，使系统可以通过对话进行讨论和修正预测。通过实验证明，所提出的系统可以与人类进行有益的讨论，将自然语言推理任务的准确性提高了高达25个百分点。",
