    "abstract": "We present methods for conditional and residual coding in the context of scalable coding for humans and machines. Our focus is on optimizing the rate-distortion performance of the reconstruction task using the information available in the computer vision task. We include an information analysis of both approaches to provide baselines and also propose an entropy model suitable for conditional coding with increased modelling capacity and similar tractability as previous work. We apply these methods to image reconstruction, using, in one instance, representations created for semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset, and in another instance, representations created for object detection on the COCO dataset. In both experiments, we obtain similar performance between the conditional and residual methods, with the resulting rate-distortion curves contained within our baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了适用于人类和机器的可扩展编码中的条件编码和残差编码方法。我们的重点是利用计算机视觉任务中可用的信息来优化重构任务的速率失真性能。我们包括了两种方法的信息分析，提供基准，并提出了一种熵模型，适用于条件编码，具备增加的建模能力和与之前的工作类似的可操作性。我们将这些方法应用于图像重建，其中一种实验使用在Cityscapes数据集上创建的语义分割表示，另一种使用在COCO数据集上创建的目标检测表示。在两个实验中，我们获得了条件和残差方法之间的类似性能，得到的速率失真曲线包含在我们的基线内。",
