The model was able to distinguishes the normal cases (control group) from the others at a precision of 100 percent and classify the myopathy and ALS with high accuracy of 97.4 and 98.2 percents, respectively.

    "translated_abstract": "我们使用L2正则化实现了一个深度学习模型，并对肌电图（EMG）数据进行了训练。该数据包括来自对照组、肌病和肌萎缩侧索硬化（ALS）患者的EMG信号。我们提出的深度神经网络由八层组成，包括五个全连接层、两个批标准化层和一个随机失活层。通过将训练数据分为子训练和验证部分，进一步将数据分成训练和测试部分。在测试数据集上实现了99%的准确率。该模型能够100%准确地区分正常病例（对照组）和其他病例，并以97.4%和98.2%的高精度分类肌病和ALS病例。因此，我们认为这种高度改进的分类准确性将有助于临床诊断神经肌肉疾病。",
