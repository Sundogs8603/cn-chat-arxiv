    "translated_abstract": "开放世界关系抽取(OpenRE)最近引起了人们的关注。然而，现有的方法往往简化了问题，假设所有未标记的文本都属于新类，从而限制了这些方法的实用性。我们认为OpenRE设置应更符合现实世界数据的特征。具体而言，我们提出了两个关键改进:(a)未标记数据应包括已知和新颖的类，包括难以区分的负样本实例;(b)新颖的类集应该代表长尾关系类型。此外，我们观察到，流行的关系，如标题和位置，通常可以通过特定的模式隐含地推断，而长尾的关系倾向于在句子中明确表示。在这些见解的推动下，我们提出了一种名为KNoRD（已知和新颖关系发现）的新方法，有效地对已知类和新颖类中的显式和隐式表示的关系进行分类。",
