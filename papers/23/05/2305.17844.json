International initiatives, including the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, emphasize the need for immediate action from all stakeholders. This paper presents a feasibility assessment focused on the opportunities within Nigeria's Electric Vehicle Value Chain, aiming to enhance public understanding of the country's renewable energy sector. As petroleum currently fulfills over 95% of global transportation needs, energy companies must diversify their portfolios and integrate various renewable energy sources to transition toward a sustainable future. The shifting investor sentiment away from traditional fossil fuel industries further highlights the imperative of incorporating renewables.

    "translated_abstract": "为了实现气候目标，建设可持续的未来，需要政府、企业、个人等所有利益相关方共同努力。国际上的可持续发展目标和《巴黎协定》强调需要所有利益相关者立即采取行动。本文提出了一项针对尼日利亚电动汽车价值链中的机遇的可行性评估，旨在增强公众对该国可再生能源行业的理解。目前石油仍然满足全球95%以上的交通需求，能源公司必须多元化其投资组合，整合各种可再生能源以实现可持续发展。距离传统化石燃料行业的转型进程越来越远，这更凸显了整合可再生能源的必要性。为了在可再生能源领域取得重大进展，建立一个可行的可持续能源供应链是至关重要的。",
