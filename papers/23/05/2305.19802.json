    "translated_abstract": "因素分析是一种通过研究带有一些相互依赖关系的观察变量可以如何表示为相互独立的未观察因素的函数的统计工具，并广泛应用于心理学、生物学和物理科学领域。我们从因果发现和深度学习的新视角重新审视这种经典方法，引入了神经因果因素分析（NCFA）的框架。我们的方法是完全非参数的：它通过潜在的因果发现方法识别因素，然后使用变分自编码器（VAE），该VAE受到与学习图的关于马尔可夫因式分解的分布相符的限制。我们评估了NCFA在真实的和合成的数据集上，发现它在数据重建任务上的表现与标准VAE相当，但具有更稀疏的架构、更低的模型复杂度和因果可解释性。与传统的FA方法不同，我们提出的NCFA方法可以通过学习到的图形表示因素之间的因果关系，从而具有因果解释性。",

It performs comparably to standard VAEs on data reconstruction tasks but with sparser architecture, lower model complexity, and causal interpretability. Unlike traditional FA methods, NCFA has causal interpretability as the learned graph represents the causal relationships between the factors."
