    "translated_abstract": "神经网络正在成为可扩展的数据驱动高维动态系统模拟工具，特别是在数值方法不可行或计算昂贵的情况下。值得注意的是，已经证明在确定性神经模拟器中引入域对称性可以大大提高其精确性、样本效率和参数效率。然而，为了将对称性纳入可以模拟随机现象的概率神经模拟器中，我们需要一个能够生成等变轨迹分布而不是等变函数逼近的模型。在本文中，我们提出了等变概率神经模拟（EPNS），这是一个用于等变分布系统演化的自回归概率建模框架。我们使用EPNS设计了一个用于随机N体系统和随机细胞动力学的模型。我们的结果表明，EPNS在p方面比现有的基于神经网络的方法表现出色。",
