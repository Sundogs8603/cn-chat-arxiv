    "translated_abstract": "医学影像中的分割在诊断、监测和治疗各种疾病和病况中起着至关重要的作用。目前，医学领域中的分割模型被众多专门针对每个分割任务和图像模态进行微调的深度学习模型占据了主导地位。最近引入了一种新的分割模型Segment Anything Model (SAM)，它利用ViT神经体系结构和广泛的训练数据集来分割几乎任何对象。然而，它在医学领域的泛化能力尚未被探索。在这项研究中，我们使用八种不同的提示策略在四种影像模态的六个数据集上评估了SAM在医学影像中的零样本能力。我们的结果表明，SAM的零样本性能与当前的最先进技术相当，在某些情况下甚至更好。基于我们的发现，我们提出了一个实用指南，需要使用较小的镜像和更多的样本来进一步提高模型性能。",
