    "translated_abstract": "本文提出一种名为Self-Driven Strategy Learning (sdsl)的轻量级在线学习方法。该方法适用于自动推理中需要解决一组相关问题的任务。sdsl会在解决早期问题时自动收集信息来生成数据集。它利用这些学习到的数据来调整后续问题的解决策略，通过在线拟合机器学习模型。我们将这种方法形式化为一组抽象的转换规则。本文还描述了一个具体的sdsl计算实例，其中使用条件采样来生成数据，采用随机森林作为底层机器学习模型。我们在Kissat求解器上实现了该方法，并展示了Kissat+sdsl在最新的硬件模型检查竞赛中比其他最先进的有限模型检查方法证明了更大的边界和发现了更多的反例。",
