    "translated_abstract": "为了使物理系统数据驱动模型的可解释性和可靠性，必须将先前的物理知识融入到建模框架中。Hamiltonian神经网络(HNN)将哈密顿理论实现在深度学习中，形成了用于建模自治能量守恒系统的综合框架。本文介绍了一种输出误差Hamiltonian神经网络（OE-HNN）建模方法，以解决具有输入和噪声状态测量的物理系统建模的挑战。此外，它不需要已知状态导数。相反，OE-HNN在训练过程中利用嵌入式ODE求解器，使其能够从带噪声的状态测量数据中学习动力学。该方法在三个物理系统上进行了演示：阻尼谐振子，混沌系统和机械臂模型。结果表明，OE-HNN提供了带有噪声测量的系统动态的准确预测，并在解释性和可靠性方面优于传统数据驱动模型。",
