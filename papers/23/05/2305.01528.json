    "translated_abstract": "Dungeons & Dragons（D＆D）是一款桌面角色扮演游戏，其玩家之间存在复杂的自然语言交互和隐藏的状态信息。最近的研究表明，拥有状态信息的大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的游戏回合比仅使用对话历史的LLMs更具高质量。然而，以往的研究使用的游戏状态信息是启发式创建的，并不是真正的黄金标准游戏状态。我们提出了FIREBALL，这是一个包含真实游戏状态信息的大型数据集，其中包含来自Discord的近25,000个真实D＆D游戏会话。我们记录了使用Avrae机器人的玩家的游戏会话，该机器人是为了帮助人们在线玩D＆D而开发的，并捕获了语言、游戏命令和基础游戏状态信息。我们证明，通过使用Avrae状态信息，FIREBALL可以提高自然语言生成（NLG），从而提高自动评估指标和人类的质量评判。此外，我们还展示了LLMs可以生成…",
