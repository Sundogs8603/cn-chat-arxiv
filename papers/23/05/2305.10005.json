    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce self-distillation and online clustering for self-supervised speech representation learning (DinoSR) which combines masked language modeling, self-distillation, and online clustering. We show that these concepts complement each other and result in a strong representation learning model for speech. DinoSR first extracts contextualized embeddings from the input audio with a teacher network, then runs an online clustering system on the embeddings to yield a machine-discovered phone inventory, and finally uses the discretized tokens to guide a student network. We show that DinoSR surpasses previous state-of-the-art performance in several downstream tasks, and provide a detailed analysis of the model and the learned discrete units. The source code will be made available after the anonymity period.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了自蒸馏和在线聚类用于自监督语音表示学习的DinoSR模型，它结合了遮蔽语言建模、自蒸馏和在线聚类这些概念，并展示它们相互补充，形成了一种强大的语音表示学习模型。DinoSR首先使用教师网络从输入音频中提取上下文化的嵌入向量，然后在嵌入向量上运行在线聚类系统以产生机器发现的音素库存，最后使用已离散化的标记指导学生网络。我们展示了DinoSR在多个下游任务中超越了以前的最新技术，并提供了模型和学习离散单元的详细分析。匿名期结束后，我们将提供源代码。",
