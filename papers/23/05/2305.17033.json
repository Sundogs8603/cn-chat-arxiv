    "translated_abstract": "儿童中枢神经系统肿瘤是儿童癌症相关死亡的最常见原因。儿童高级别胶质瘤的五年生存率不到20％。由于罕见，对这些实体的诊断通常会延迟，其治疗主要基于历史治疗理念，并且临床试验需要多机构合作。MICCAI大脑肿瘤分割（BraTS）挑战是一个里程碑式的社区基准事件，已经成功创建资源12年，用于成人胶质瘤的分割和分析。在这里，我们介绍了CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs 2023挑战，这是首个专注于儿童脑肿瘤的BraTS挑战，其中包括多个国际合作组织专注于儿科神经肿瘤和临床试验的数据。BraTS-PEDs 2023挑战侧重于评估用于儿童脑胶质瘤的体积分割算法的发展。",
