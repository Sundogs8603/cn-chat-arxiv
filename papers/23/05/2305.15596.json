The classical version of this problem assumes a central computational server that observes the entire state of the system perfectly and directs individual agents according to a centralized control scheme. In contrast, we assume that there is no centralized server and that each agent is an individual processor with no a priori knowledge of the underlying network (including task and agent locations). Moreover, our agents possess strictly local communication and sensing capabilities (restricted to a fixed radius around their respective locations), aligning more closely with several real-world multiagent applications. These restrictions introduce many challenges that are overcome through local",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一个广泛化的多车辆路径规划问题：给定一个网络、一组占据网络节点子集的智能体和一组任务, 我们寻求一个最小成本的移动序列，以满足每个任务至少被一个智能体访问的约束条件。与经典问题不同的是，我们假定没有中央服务器，每个智能体都是一个个体处理器，没有关于基础网络（包括任务和智能体位置）的先验知识。此外，我们的智能体具有严格的本地通信和感知能力（限制在它们各自位置周围的半径范围内），更接近多实际应用。我们提出了一种在线策略方法，其中智能体根据集中式模拟器训练的学习型策略局部规划其轨迹。我们在模拟环境中展示了我们的方法，并表明它在网络拓扑和任务分布的变化下仍然能够实现近最优性能。",
