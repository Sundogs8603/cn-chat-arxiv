    "translated_abstract": "在 JIT-SDP 上下文中，由于软件开发过程的变化、软件复杂性或用户行为的变化可能会影响随时间稳定性的 JIT-SDP 模型，因此可能会出现概念漂移（CD）。另外，在 JIT-SDP 数据中出现的类别不平衡现象可能会对 CD 检测方法的准确性构成潜在威胁，如果进行重新平衡，则会出现这种情况。据我们所知，这个问题尚未得到探讨。此外，已经提出了通过考虑标记的评估数据来检查 JIT-SDP 模型随时间的稳定性的方法。然而，需要注意的是，未来的数据标签可能并不总是及时可用。我们旨在通过识别未标记的简化和重新采样数据解释中的变化来直接识别 CD 的点，从而开发一个可靠的 JIT-SDP 模型。为了评估我们的方法，我们首先通过基于模型性能监控的基线方法来识别 CD 点。",
