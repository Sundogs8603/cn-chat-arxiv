    "abstract": "In the EU-27 countries, the importance of social sustainability of digital transformation (SOSDIT) is heightened by the need to balance economic growth with social cohesion. By prioritizing SOSDIT, the EU can ensure that its citizens are not left behind in the digital transformation process and that technology serves the needs of all Europeans. Therefore, the current study aimed firstly to evaluate the SOSDIT of EU-27 countries and then to model its importance in reaching sustainable development goals (SDGs). The current study, using structural equation modeling, provided quantitative empirical evidence that digital transformation in Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are respectively most socially sustainable. It is also found that SOSDIT leads the countries to have a higher performance in reaching SDGs. Finally, the study provided evidence implying the inverse relationship between the Gini coefficient and reaching SDGs. In other words, the higher the Gini coefficient of a country,",

    "translated_abstract": "在欧盟27个国家，社会可持续性在数字转型过程中的重要性日益增强，需要平衡经济增长和社会凝聚力。通过优先考虑社会可持续性，欧盟能够确保其公民在数字转型过程中不被落下，技术服务于所有欧洲人的需求。因此，本研究的首要目标是评估欧盟27个国家的社会可持续性，并模拟其在实现可持续发展目标中的重要性。该研究采用结构方程建模提供了量化实证证据，表明芬兰、荷兰和丹麦的数字化转型是最具有社会可持续性的。研究还发现，社会可持续性导致各国在实现可持续发展目标方面表现更好。最后，该研究提供了证据，说明基尼系数与实现可持续发展目标之间存在反向关系。换句话说，一个国家的基尼系数越高，",
