    "translated_abstract": "本文利用高速光学诊断技术与机器学习方法，重点研究了单颗粒点火的精确确定。通过同时进行10 kHz OH-LIF和DBI测量，可以可视化层流反应器中单个颗粒的点火过程。研究两种煤粒粒径（90-125μm和160-200μm）在常规空气和富氧条件下随氧气浓度增加的点火延迟时间。首先使用阈值方法评估点火延迟时间，结果与人眼观察得到的地面真实值存在明显偏差。然后，使用ResNet和FPN对地面真实值进行训练，并将其应用于预测点火时间。这两个网络都能够以显著更高的准确性和精度检测点火。此外，还考察了输入数据和网络深度对训练模型预测性能的影响。本研究表明，FPN的分层特征比ResNet的剩余连接更有利于精确检测点火过程。",

After training with ground truth data, both ResNet and FPN networks significantly improve accuracy and precision of ignition detection. The study finds that the hierarchical features of FPN are more beneficial for accurate ignition detection than the residual connections of ResNet."
