    "translated_abstract": "对于生物体存储事件序列的时间顺序至关重要，然而大脑中支配时序记忆的计算机制仍不清楚。本文受到神经科学理论和预测编码（PC）在静态存储任务中的成功启示，提出了一种基于PC的新型时序记忆模型，称为时间预测编码（tPC）。我们展示了我们的tPC模型可以通过生物可行的神经实现准确地记忆和检索连续输入。重要的是，我们的分析研究表明，tPC可以被看作是一种具有隐式统计白化过程的经典异向性霍普菲尔德网络（AHN），这会在结构化输入的时序记忆任务中导致更稳定的性能。此外，我们发现具有多层结构的tPC可以编码上下文相关信息，因此可以区分在序列中出现的重复元素。",
