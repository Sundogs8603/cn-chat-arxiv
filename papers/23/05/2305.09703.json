    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络，特别是动态图神经网络，已经成为时空预测问题中的研究热点。虽然许多动态图构建方法已经被开发，但其中相对较少的探索了邻居节点之间的因果关系。因此，由此产生的模型缺乏对动态生成图的邻居节点之间因果关系的强大可解释性，这很容易导致后续决策的风险。此外，很少有人考虑基于时间序列数据集的动态图的不确定性和噪声，而这在真实世界的图结构网络中是普遍存在的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于扩散变分图神经网络（DVGNN）的时空预测方法。对于动态图构建，设计了一种无监督生成模型。在编码器阶段，应用两层图卷积网络（GCN）来计算潜在节点嵌入的后验分布。",
