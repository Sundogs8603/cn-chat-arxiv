    "abstract": "With the proliferation of algorithmic decision-making, increased scrutiny has been placed on these systems. This paper explores the relationship between the quality of the training data and the overall fairness of the models trained with such data in the context of supervised classification. We measure key fairness metrics across a range of algorithms over multiple image classification datasets that have a varying level of noise in both the labels and the training data itself. We describe noise in the labels as inaccuracies in the labelling of the data in the training set and noise in the data as distortions in the data, also in the training set. By adding noise to the original datasets, we can explore the relationship between the quality of the training data and the fairness of the output of the models trained on that data.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着算法决策的普及，对这些系统的关注越来越多。本文探讨了在监督分类的情况下，训练数据的质量和使用此类数据训练的模型的整体公平性之间的关系。我们在多个图像分类数据集上测量关键的公平性指标，其中包含标签和训练数据本身噪声水平不同的情况。我们将标签中的噪声描述为训练集中数据标记的不准确性，将数据中的噪声描述为数据中的扭曲，也是训练集中的内容。通过向原始数据集添加噪声，我们可以探索训练数据的质量与在该数据上训练的模型输出的公平性之间的关系。",
