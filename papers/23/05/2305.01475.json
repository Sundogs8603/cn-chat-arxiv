    "translated_abstract": "基因组数据在现代医学中至关重要，为诊断和治疗提供了重要的潜力。得益于技术进步，已经对许多百万的健康和患有疾病的基因组进行了测序；然而，对于具体研究和特别是验证研究来说，获取最合适的数据仍然具有规模和可访问性上的挑战。因此，已经提出了基于计算机模拟的基因组序列发生器作为一种可能的解决方案。然而，目前的生成器使用的数据大都较差，主要是使用浅层（随机）连接在训练数据中用有限的计算复杂性检测出来的。这意味着它们没有考虑到最初导致观察到的连接的合适的生物关系和约束条件。为解决这个问题，我们提出了基于肿瘤启发的基因组映射模型（CGMM），它结合了遗传算法（GA）和深度学习（DL）方法来解决这个问题。CGMM模拟了产生基因组序列的过程，以便生成具有所需基因组标志的合成DNA序列。",
