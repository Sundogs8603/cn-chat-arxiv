This paper presents a convergence analysis for end-to-end deep learning of fully connected neural networks (FNN) with smooth activation functions.

    "translated_abstract": "在大多数控制应用中，系统的理论分析对确保稳定性或收敛至关重要，以确保安全可靠的运行并获得更好的系统理解以进行进一步的发展。然而，大多数当前的深度学习方法是黑盒方法，更多地关注经验性研究。本文提出了一种基于平滑激活函数的全连接神经网络（FNN）端到端深度学习收敛分析方法，避免了潜在的抖动问题，同时也不易导致梯度消失问题。该算法可以同时训练多个两层全连接网络，并使用协作学习进一步结合它们的优势。",
