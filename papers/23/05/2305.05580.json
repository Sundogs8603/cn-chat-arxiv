    "translated_abstract": "精确的产品信息对于电子商务商店非常重要，以允许客户浏览、筛选和搜索产品。由于缺失或不正确的信息会导致客户体验不佳，因此使用机器学习来纠正不准确或缺失的信息是关键。然而，在服装图像分类任务上获得高性能需要大量的注释数据，但由于标注成本而费用昂贵。一种解决方案是生成不需要手动标记的合成数据。但是，使用仅由合成图像组成的数据集来训练模型，可能会导致在实际数据上推理时性能下降，因为存在领域转移。本文介绍了一种新的无监督领域自适应技术，将合成域的图像转换为真实世界域。我们的方法结合了生成神经网络和分类器的联合训练，以产生逼真的图像同时保持分类准确性。",
