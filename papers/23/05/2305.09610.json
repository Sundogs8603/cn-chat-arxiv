    "translated_abstract": "最近的语义分割模型对于和训练数据集分布相似的测试样本进行分类具有很高的准确性。但是，它们的判别式闭合方法在实际数据设置中对于分布偏移和越界（OOD）类不够稳健。因此，在测试时间使用预测概率作为置信度分数时，预测的概率可能非常不精确。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于正常化流框架的生成模型，用于并发的在分布内误分类（IDM）和越界检测。所提出的基于流的带有能量输入的检测器（FlowEneDet）可以扩展先前部署的分割模型而无需耗费大量时间进行重新训练。我们的FlowEneDet在内存占用方面具有极小的增加，因此具有低复杂度架构。在Cityscapes、Cityscapes-C、FishyScapes和 SegmentMeIfYouCan评估中，FlowEneDet在使用预先训练的DeepLabV3+和Translated title:基于能量归一化流的语义分割中并发误分类和越界检测的测试中实现很好的结果。",
