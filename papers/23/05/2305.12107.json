    "abstract": "While Current TTS systems perform well in synthesizing high-quality speech, producing highly expressive speech remains a challenge. Emphasis, as a critical factor in determining the expressiveness of speech, has attracted more attention nowadays. Previous works usually enhance the emphasis by adding intermediate features, but they can not guarantee the overall expressiveness of the speech. To resolve this matter, we propose Emphatic Expressive TTS (EE-TTS), which leverages multi-level linguistic information from syntax and semantics. EE-TTS contains an emphasis predictor that can identify appropriate emphasis positions from text and a conditioned acoustic model to synthesize expressive speech with emphasis and linguistic information. Experimental results indicate that EE-TTS outperforms baseline with MOS improvements of 0.49 and 0.67 in expressiveness and naturalness. EE-TTS also shows strong generalization across different datasets according to AB test results.",

    "translated_abstract": "目前的TTS系统能够合成高质量的语音，但要产生高度表现力的语音仍然是一个挑战。强调是决定语音表现力的关键因素，近年来受到了更多的关注。以前的研究通常通过添加中间特征来增强强调，但不能保证语音的整体表现力。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为EE-TTS的新方法，它利用句法和语义上的多层语言信息。EE-TTS包含一个强调位置预测器，可以从文本中识别出适当的强调位置，并具有一个条件声学模型，可以合成带强调和语言信息的表现力语音。实验结果表明，EE-TTS在表现力和自然度方面比基线有0.49和0.67的MOS提升。EE-TTS还表现出强大的泛化能力，根据AB测试结果在不同数据集上都表现良好。",
