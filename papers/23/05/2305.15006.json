    "translated_abstract": "机器可读的隐私政策描述可以为各种新型隐私增强和特别是透明度增强技术提供便利。为了生成这样的描述，需要从书面隐私政策中提取透明度信息，然而，这种手动注释和提取过程是费力的并需要专业知识。而全自动注释方法则在隐私政策特定领域的错误率过高而不能成功。缺乏适当注释的隐私政策以及相应的机器可读描述，持久地阻碍了新技术的发展和建立，进而促进政策认知和数据主体知情。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一种“人在循环”的隐私政策注释原型系统，它将ML生成的建议与人工注释相集成，有助于解决缺乏适当注释的隐私政策与机器可读描述这一难题，促进政策认知和数据主体知情。"
