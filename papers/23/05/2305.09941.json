    "translated_abstract": "跨性别和非二元（TGNB）人群在日常生活中经历了不成比例的歧视和排斥。随着语言生成技术的日益普及和应用，进一步边缘化这一人群的可能性也在增加。虽然大量的NLP公平文献着重于阐明和解决性别偏见，但评估TGNB身份所带来的性别伤害需要理解这些身份如何独特地与社会性别规范互动以及与性别二元中心的视角相区分。这样的测量框架本质上需要以TGNB声音为中心，帮助指导包容性别的自然语言处理应该为谁服务。为实现这一目标，我们以TGNB社区和现有的跨学科文献为基础，评估了TGNB个体经历边缘化所形成的社会现实是如何影响和存在于开放式语言生成（OLG）中。首先理解TGNB个体的经历，我们提出了一个评估OLG系统的框架，旨在以TGNB人群为中心，度量与该人群相关的偏见。我们的框架包括特别为TGNB人群设计的调查工具，以及交叉分析结果的交叉方法。我们相信，这项工作将有助于实现更公平、更包容的自然语言处理社区，并潜在地解决NLP研究中广泛的交叉身份问题。",
