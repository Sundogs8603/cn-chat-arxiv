    "translated_abstract": "现代在线服务提供商，如在线购物平台通常提供搜索和推荐（S＆R）服务以满足不同的用户需求。很少有任何有效的手段将来自S＆R服务的用户行为数据结合起来。大多数现有的方法要么仅将S＆R行为单独处理，要么通过聚合两个服务的数据来联合优化它们，忽略了S＆R中用户意图可以有截然不同的事实。在我们的论文中，我们提出了一种基于搜索增强的顺序推荐（SESRec）框架，通过区分S＆R行为中的相似和不相似表示，利用用户的搜索兴趣进行推荐。具体而言，SESRec首先根据用户的查询-项目交互来对齐查询和项目嵌入以计算它们的相似性。然后，使用两个转换器编码器来独立地学习S＆R行为的上下文表示。最后，设计了对比学习任务以学习搜素特征表示和推荐特征表示的相似度距离，使得S＆R特征能够更好地发挥其独特的优势。",
