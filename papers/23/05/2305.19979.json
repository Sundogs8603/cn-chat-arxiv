    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱是表示和组织复杂生物医学数据的强大工具。已经提出了多种知识图谱嵌入算法来学习和完善知识图谱。然而，最近的一项研究表明，当应用于生物医学知识图谱时，这些嵌入算法的有效性有限，引发了对知识图谱嵌入在生物医学环境中是否存在限制的疑问。本研究旨在将最先进的知识图谱嵌入模型应用于最近的生物医学知识图谱BioKG，评估其性能和潜在的下游用途。在相同的生物医学知识图谱上，我们在HITS@10得分方面的性能改进了三倍。此外，我们通过基于规则的方法提供可解释的预测。通过对四个任务上表现最佳的模型进行评估，我们证明了知识图谱嵌入模型在实践中是可应用的。",
