    "translated_abstract": "个性化医学领域的决策制定，如癌症治疗或危重护理，通常必须对剂量组合进行选择，即多种连续治疗。现有的这项任务的工作已经独立地建模了多种治疗的效果，而估计联合效果却受到了很少的关注，并且面临着非平凡的挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，用于剂量组合的可靠脱机学习。我们的方法分为三个步骤：（1）我们开发了一个特定的神经网络，估计个性化的剂量-反应函数，同时考虑多个相关剂量的联合效应。（2）我们使用条件正态化流量估计广义倾向得分，以检测共享协变量-治疗空间中重叠有限的区域。（3）我们提供一种基于梯度的学习算法，以找到最佳的个性化剂量组合。在此，我们确保可靠地估计策略价值。",
