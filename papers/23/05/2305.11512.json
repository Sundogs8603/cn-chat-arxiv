    "translated_abstract": "解缠结表示学习是一项具有挑战性的任务，涉及到在复杂数据中分离多个变化因素。虽然已经提出了各种用于学习和评估解缠结表示的度量标准，但这些度量标准真正量化了什么以及如何比较它们仍然不清楚。在本文中，我们研究了利用一阶方程谓词定义的解缠结，并介绍了一种基于丰富范畴论的系统方法，将方程定义转化为兼容的定量度量标准。具体而言，我们展示了如何用度量或离散度替换(i) 等式，用排序操作替换 (ii) 逻辑联结词，用聚合替换 (iii) 通用量词，用最佳逼近替换 (iv) 存在量词。使用这种方法，我们推导出用于测量解缠结表示提取器所需属性的度量标准，并在合成数据上展示它们的有效性。我们提出的方法提供了一种框架，能够将解缠结表示定义转化为可比较的，并衡量一种方法中解缠结属性的有效性。",
