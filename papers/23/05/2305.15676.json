    "abstract": "Grammatical error correction systems improve written communication by detecting and correcting language mistakes. To help language learners better understand why the GEC system makes a certain correction, the causes of errors (evidence words) and the corresponding error types are two key factors. To enhance GEC systems with explanations, we introduce EXPECT, a large dataset annotated with evidence words and grammatical error types. We propose several baselines and anlysis to understand this task. Furthermore, human evaluation verifies our explainable GEC system's explanations can assist second-language learners in determining whether to accept a correction suggestion and in understanding the associated grammar rule.",

    "translated_abstract": "语法校正系统通过检测和更正语言错误来提升书写交流。为了帮助语言学习者更好地理解GEC系统为什么做出某种更正，错误的原因（证据单词）和相应的错误类型是两个关键因素。为了用解释增强GEC系统，我们引入了EXPECT，一个大数据集，其中包含了证据单词和语法错误类型的注释。我们提出了几个基线和分析方法来理解这个任务。此外，人类评估证明，我们可解释的GEC系统的解释能够帮助第二语言学习者确定是否接受更正建议，并理解相关的语法规则。",
