    "translated_abstract": "问答技术的指数级增长使其成为任何自然语言处理（NLP）课程中不可或缺的话题。此外，这种指数级增长所导致的问答广度使其成为教授相关NLP主题（如信息检索、可解释性和对抗攻击等）的理想场景。本文介绍了UKP-SQuARE作为QA教育平台。该平台提供了一个交互式环境，在这里学生可以运行、比较和分析不同角度的各种QA模型，如一般行为，可解释性和鲁棒性。因此，学生可以在课堂上亲身体验不同的QA技术。由于这一点，我们提出了一种以学生为中心的QA教育方法，学生可以通过交互式的探索、实验和实践任务主动学习理论概念并获得问题解决技能，而不仅仅依赖传统的讲授。",
