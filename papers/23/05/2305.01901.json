    "abstract": "Few-shot event detection (ED) has been widely studied, while this brings noticeable discrepancies, e.g., various motivations, tasks, and experimental settings, that hinder the understanding of models for future progress. This paper presents a thorough empirical study, a unified view of ED models, and a better unified baseline. For fair evaluation, we choose two practical settings: low-resource setting to assess generalization ability and class-transfer setting for transferability. We compare ten representative methods on three datasets, which are roughly grouped into prompt-based and prototype-based models for detailed analysis. To investigate the superior performance of prototype-based methods, we break down the design and build a unified framework. Based on that, we not only propose a simple yet effective method (e.g., 2.7% F1 gains under low-resource setting) but also offer many valuable research insights for future research.",

    "translated_abstract": "小样本事件检测 (ED) 已经被广泛研究，然而这也带来了明显的差异，例如各种动机、任务和实验设置，这些差异妨碍了模型的理解和未来进展。本文提出了一项彻底的经验研究、一个ED模型的统一视角和一个更好的统一基准线。为了公平评估，我们选择了两个实用的设置：低资源设置来评估泛化能力和类转移设置来评估可转移性。我们比较了三个数据集上的十种代表性方法，这些方法大致被分为基于提示和基于原型的模型进行详细分析。为了调查基于原型方法的优越性能，我们分解了设计并建立了一个统一框架。基于此，我们不仅提出了一种简单而有效的方法（例如在低资源设置下获得2.7％F1收益），而且为未来的研究提供了许多有价值的研究见解。",
