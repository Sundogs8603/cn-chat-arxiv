    "translated_abstract": "马哈巴拉塔叙事文本是印度最流行的文学作品之一，在许多领域中以完全不同的目的被引用。在自然语言处理、人工智能、机器学习和人机交互的时代，这个文本可以根据领域需求进行处理。在分析马哈巴拉塔时，人类分析者会有情感因素，而且也无法记忆句子中常见的单词和句子的平均长度等计算细节。本文提出一种基于语言模型的计算方法来估计马哈巴拉塔中的相关词语。该方法包括对文本进行预处理和构建语言模型，并使用模型估计单词的共现概率和相关性分数。我们通过实验证明了该方法能够有效地估计从马哈巴拉塔中提取出的相关词汇。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a language model-based methodology for estimating related words from the Mahabharata, a popular Indian piece of literature. The approach involves preprocessing the text, building a language model, and estimating word co-occurrence probabilities and relatedness scores between pairs of words. The method is effective in extracting related words from the Mahabharata."
