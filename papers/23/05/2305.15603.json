We benchmark two well-studied fluid-flow systems, namely 3D decaying Taylor-Green vortex and 3D reverse Poiseuille flow, and evaluate the models based on different performance measures, such as kinetic energy or Sinkhorn distance. In addition, we investigate different embedding methods of physical-information histories for equivariant models. We find that while currently being rather slow to train and evaluate, equivariant models with our proposed history embeddings learn more accurate physical interactions.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们在机器学习工程系统快速发展的领域中做出了贡献，证明等变图神经网络比非等变网络有潜力学习更准确的动态交互模型。我们对两个广为研究的流体流动系统进行基准测试，即3D衰减Taylor-Green漩涡和3D逆Poiseuille流，并根据不同的性能评估指标（如动能或Sinkhorn距离）评估模型。此外，我们还调查了不同的物理信息历史嵌入方法，以用于等变模型。我们发现，虽然目前训练和评估速度较慢，但采用我们提出的历史嵌入的等变模型可以学习到更准确的物理相互作用。",
