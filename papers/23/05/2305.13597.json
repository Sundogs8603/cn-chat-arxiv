We argue that many of the prevalent problems in recommender systems are partly due to low-dimensionality of user and item embeddings, particularly when dot-product models, such as matrix factorization, are used.  In this study, we showcase empirical evidence suggesting the necessity of sufficient dimensionality for user/item embeddings to achieve diverse, fair, and robust recommendation. We then present theoretical analyses of the expressive power of dot-product models. Our theoretical results demonstrate that the number of possible rankings expressible under dot-product models is exponentially bounded by the dimension of item factors. We empirically found that the low-dimensionality contributes to a popularity bias, widening the gap between the rank positions of popular and long-tail items; we also give a theoretical justification for this phenomenon.",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统的质量不仅仅与准确度有关，还包括多样性、公平性和鲁棒性等方面。本文认为推荐系统中许多问题的产生部分原因是用户和物品嵌入的低维度，特别是在使用矩阵分解等点积模型时。我们呈现了证据表明，对于嵌入向量，维度需要足够高才能达到多样化、公平和稳健的推荐。我们还对点积模型的表现能力进行了理论分析，结果表明在物品因子的维度上，点积模型能够表达的可能排名数是指数级绑定的。我们在实验中发现，低维度对于流行度偏差带来的贡献扩大了流行和长尾物品在排名位置上的差距，我们还给出了这一现象的理论解释。",
