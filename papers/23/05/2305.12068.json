    "abstract": "The ADMANI datasets (annotated digital mammograms and associated non-image datasets) from the Transforming Breast Cancer Screening with AI programme (BRAIx) run by BreastScreen Victoria in Australia are multi-centre, large scale, clinically curated, real-world databases. The datasets are expected to aid in the development of clinically relevant Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for breast cancer detection, early diagnosis, and other applications. To ensure high data quality, technical outliers must be removed before any downstream algorithm development. As a first step, we randomly select 30,000 individual mammograms and use Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), a deep generative neural network, to detect outliers. CVAE is expected to detect all sorts of outliers, although its detection performance differs among different types of outliers. Traditional image processing techniques such as erosion and pectoral muscle analysis can compensate for the poor performance of CVAE ",

    "translated_abstract": "澳大利亚BreastScreen Victoria运营着Transforming Breast Cancer Screening with AI计划，收集了注释数字乳腺X线图像及其相关非图像数据，组成了大规模、临床筛选、真实世界的ADMANI数据集。该数据集可望为乳腺癌检测、早期诊断和其他应用开发临床相关的人工智能算法提供帮助。然而，在进行近下游算法开发之前，必须删除技术异常值以确保高质量的数据。我们首先随机选取3万个乳腺X线图像，使用深度生成神经网络中一种类型——卷积变分自编码器（CVAE）来检测异常值。尽管CVAE在不同类型的异常点检测性能上有所不同，但它预计可检测到各种异常值类型。对于CVAE的性能不足，传统的图像处理技术，如腐蚀和胸大肌分析，则可进行补偿。",
