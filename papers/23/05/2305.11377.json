    "translated_title": "GraphFC: 带有少量标签数据的海关欺诈检测",
    "translated_abstract": "全球的海关官员每年面对着海量的交易。随着连通性和全球化的增加，海关交易持续增长。与海关交易相关的是海关欺诈——即有意修改货物申报以避免税款和关税。由于人手不足，海关办公室只能对有限数量的申报进行手动检查。这需要通过机器学习（ML）技术自动化海关欺诈检测。然而，由于新进申报检查的标签数据受限，ML方法应具有稳健的性能。本文提出了$\\textbf{GraphFC}$（海关欺诈$\\textbf{GNN}$（$\\textbf{G}$raph $\\textbf{N}$eural $\\textbf{N}$etworks）），这是一个模型不可知、领域特定、半监督图神经网络框架，用于少量标签数据的欺诈检测。$\\textbf{GraphFC}$利用图神经网络和半监督学习的最新进展，有效地结合标记和未标记数据，提高了欺诈检测的性能。我们在实际的海关交易数据集上评估了我们的提议框架，并展示了它在标签数据稀缺的情况下检测海关欺诈的有效性。",
