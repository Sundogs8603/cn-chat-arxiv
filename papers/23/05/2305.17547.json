    "abstract": "This paper presents Translatotron 3, a novel approach to train a direct speech-to-speech translation model from monolingual speech-text datasets only in a fully unsupervised manner. Translatotron 3 combines masked autoencoder, unsupervised embedding mapping, and back-translation to achieve this goal. Experimental results in speech-to-speech translation tasks between Spanish and English show that Translatotron 3 outperforms a baseline cascade system, reporting 18.14 BLEU points improvement on the synthesized Unpaired-Conversational dataset. In contrast to supervised approaches that necessitate real paired data, which is unavailable, or specialized modeling to replicate para-/non-linguistic information, Translatotron 3 showcases its capability to retain para-/non-linguistic such as pauses, speaking rates, and speaker identity.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了Translatotron 3的新方法，通过遮蔽自编码器、无监督的嵌入映射和回译将直接语音到语音翻译模型从单声道语音-文本数据集中完全无监督地进行训练。在西班牙语和英语之间的语音到语音翻译任务中，实验结果表明，Translatotron 3优于基准级联系统，在 synthesized Unpaired-Conversational 数据集上报告了18.14 BLEU分数的提高。与需要真实配对数据或专业建模来复制语言/非语言信息的监督方法不同，Translatotron 3展示了它保留了像暂停、说话速度和说话人身份等语言/非语言信息的能力。",
