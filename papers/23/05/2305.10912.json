    "abstract": "We investigate the use of transformer sequence models as dynamics models (TDMs) for control. In a number of experiments in the DeepMind control suite, we find that first, TDMs perform well in a single-environment learning setting when compared to baseline models. Second, TDMs exhibit strong generalization capabilities to unseen environments, both in a few-shot setting, where a generalist model is fine-tuned with small amounts of data from the target environment, and in a zero-shot setting, where a generalist model is applied to an unseen environment without any further training. We further demonstrate that generalizing system dynamics can work much better than generalizing optimal behavior directly as a policy. This makes TDMs a promising ingredient for a foundation model of control.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究使用Transformer序列模型作为控制的动力学模型(TDMs)。我们在DeepMind控制套件中进行了一系列实验，发现首先，在单环境学习设置中，与基准模型相比，TDMs表现良好。其次，TDMs表现出强大的泛化能力，可以很好地应用于未见过的环境，包括few-shot学习和zero-shot学习。我们进一步证明，相比于直接作为策略通用最优行为，泛化系统动力学可以更好地工作。这使得TDMs成为控制的基础模型中具有很大的潜力的一个重要组成部分。",
