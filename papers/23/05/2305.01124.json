    "translated_abstract": "自适应机器有潜力在多种情境下帮助或干扰人类行为，从认知决策到物理设备援助。因此，了解机器学习算法如何影响人类行为尤为关键，特别是在机器目标与人类目标不一致的情况下。由于人类使用显式和隐含策略不断适应他们的环境，因此当环境中包含自适应机器时，人类和机器将进行博弈。博弈论是一种用于建模两个或多个决策者之间交互的成熟框架，在经济市场和机器算法中被广泛应用。然而，现有方法对个体人类的适应如何受自适应机器交互影响进行假设，而不是通过实证测试。在这里，我们测试了机器学习算法与人类主体进行一般和游戏的玩法。我们的算法收敛于著名的博弈论均衡，尽管人类适应能力和不同的机器学习方法存在差异。我们还发现，自适应机器的存在可以导致人类行为向更加剥削性的策略转变。我们的结果证明在自适应机器的设计中考虑人机交互的重要性，并建议博弈论可以是预测这些情境下人类行为的有用工具。",
