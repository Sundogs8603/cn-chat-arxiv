    "abstract": "This paper studies the multi-period mean-variance portfolio allocation problem with transaction costs. Many methods have been proposed these last years to challenge the famous uni-period Markowitz strategy.But these methods cannot integrate transaction costs or become computationally heavy and hardly applicable. In this paper, we try to tackle this allocation problem by proposing an innovative approach which relies on representing the set of admissible portfolios by a finite dimensional Wiener chaos expansion. This numerical method is able to find an optimal strategy for the allocation problem subject to transaction costs. To complete the study, the link between optimal portfolios submitted to transaction costs and the underlying risk aversion is investigated. Then a competitive and compliant benchmark based on the sequential uni-period Markowitz strategy is built to highlight the efficiency of our approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了带交易成本多期均值-方差组合投资问题。近年来，许多方法已经被提出来挑战著名的单期Markowitz策略。但是这些方法不能考虑交易成本或者变得计算复杂并难以应用。在本文中，我们试图通过提出一种新的方法来解决这个组合投资问题，该方法基于使用有限维Wiener混沌展开来表示合法组合集。该数值方法能够找到一个在交易成本约束下的最优策略。为了完成研究，我们还研究了受交易成本限制的最优组合投资组合和底层风险规避之间的联系。然后，基于顺序单期Markowitz策略构建了一个竞争性和合规的基准，以凸显我们方法的效率。",
