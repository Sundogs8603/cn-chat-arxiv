    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming a key component in diverse systems across the board. However, despite their success, they often err miserably; and this has triggered significant interest in formally verifying them. Unfortunately, DNN verifiers are intricate tools, and are themselves susceptible to soundness bugs. Due to the complexity of DNN verifiers, as well as the sizes of the DNNs being verified, debugging such errors is a daunting task. Here, we present a novel tool, named DelBugV, that uses automated delta debugging techniques on DNN verifiers. Given a malfunctioning DNN verifier and a correct verifier as a point of reference (or, in some cases, just a single, malfunctioning verifier), DelBugV can produce much simpler DNN verification instances that still trigger undesired behavior -- greatly facilitating the task of debugging the faulty verifier. Our tool is modular and extensible, and can easily be enhanced with additional network simplification methods and strategies.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络已经成为各种系统的关键组成部分。然而，尽管它们非常成功，但它们经常出现严重的错误；这引起了对其进行形式验证的重大兴趣。不幸的是，DNN验证器是复杂的工具，它们本身容易受到正确性错误的影响。由于DNN验证器的复杂性以及正在验证的DNN的大小，因此调试此类错误是一项艰巨的任务。在这里，我们介绍了一种名为DelBugV的新型工具，它使用自动化的增量调试技术在DNN验证器上进行调试。给定一个有故障的DNN验证器和一个正确的验证器作为参考点（或在某些情况下仅一个有故障的验证器），DelBugV可以产生更简单的DNN验证实例，仍然会触发不需要的行为--这极大地促进了调试故障验证器的任务。我们的工具是模块化和可扩展的，并且可以轻松地通过附加网络简化方法和策略进行增强。",
