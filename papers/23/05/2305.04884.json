    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of a novel method called linear law-based feature space transformation (LLT) on the accuracy of intraday price movement prediction of cryptocurrencies. To do this, the 1-minute interval price data of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Ripple between 1 January 2019 and 22 October 2022 were collected from the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. Then, 14-hour nonoverlapping time windows were applied to sample the price data. The classification was based on the first 12 hours, and the two classes were determined based on whether the closing price rose or fell after the next 2 hours. These price data were first transformed with the LLT, then they were classified by traditional machine learning algorithms with 10-fold cross-validation. Based on the results, LLT greatly increased the accuracy for all cryptocurrencies, which emphasizes the potential of the LLT algorithm in predicting price movements.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在研究一种名为线性定律特征空间转换法（LLT）的新方法对加密货币日内价格运动预测准确性的影响。为了实现这一目的，本文从Binance加密货币交易所收集了比特币、以太坊、币安币和瑞波币2019年1月1日至2022年10月22日期间的1分钟间隔的价格数据，对这些数据进行了14小时不重叠的时间窗采样，并根据前12个小时的数据进行分类，根据接下来的2个小时的收盘价上涨或下跌为两个类别。这些价格数据首先使用LLT进行了转换，然后使用传统机器学习算法进行10折交叉验证的分类。根据结果，LLT大大提高了所有加密货币的准确性，凸显了LLT算法在预测价格运动中的潜力。",
