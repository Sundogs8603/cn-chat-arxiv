    "translated_abstract": "脾脏体积的测量主要与患有慢性肝病和门静脉高压的患者有关，因为他们的脾脏形状和大小通常异常。然而，手动分割脾脏以获得其体积是一个耗时的过程。深度学习算法已被证明是自动化脾脏分割的有效工具，但训练这些算法需要一个适当的数据集。据我们所知，现有的几个公开的脾脏分割数据集缺乏混淆特征，如腹水和腹壁静脉曲张。为解决这个问题，开发了杜克脾脏数据集（DSDS），其中包括来自慢性肝病和门静脉高压患者的109个CT和MRI体积。该数据集包括各种图像类型、供应商、平面和对比度，以及由于基础疾病状态导致的不同的脾脏形状和大小。DSDS旨在促进创建能考虑疾病脾脏复杂性的强大脾脏分割模型。",
