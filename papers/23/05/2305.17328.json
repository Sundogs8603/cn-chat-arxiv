    "translated_abstract": "最近在边缘设备上部署Transformer模型变得越来越具有挑战性，原因是模型的体积呈指数级增长，而推理成本则随输入序列中令牌数量的平方提高。令牌剪枝是解决这一挑战的新兴解决方法之一，由于其易于在各种Transformer支持的模型上部署。然而，大多数令牌剪枝方法需要在剪枝后或期间进行计算密集型的微调过程，在许多情况下这是不可取的。最近的一些研究探讨了没有微调的即插即用的预训练Transformer的剪枝方法。但是，它们只考虑了令牌的重要性。在这项工作中，我们提出了Zero-TPrune，这是一种零射击方法，它既考虑令牌的重要性又考虑相似性来执行令牌剪枝。Zero-TPrune利用预训练Transformer模型的注意图来为令牌生成一个重要性排名并移除信息较少的令牌。注意矩阵可用于推断即插即用的模型。",
