    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了在运动科学和医学领域使用大型语言模型（LLM）所面临的潜在机遇、风险和挑战。LLM是大规模神经网络，采用转换器风格的架构，在大量文本数据上训练，并通常通过人类反馈进行改进。LLM可以执行大量的自然语言处理任务。在运动科学和医学领域，LLM具有支持和增强运动医学从业者知识的潜力，为个性化训练计划提供建议，并潜在地向发展中国家的从业者分发高质量信息。但是，使用和开发LLM也存在潜在风险，包括基于用于创建模型的数据集的偏见，泄露机密数据的风险，生成有害输出的风险，以及需要通过反馈使这些模型与人类喜好相一致的需求。需要进一步研究来全面了解LLM的使用。",
