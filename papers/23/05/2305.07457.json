    "translated_abstract": "质量估计（QE）是预测机器翻译（MT）系统输出质量的任务，不使用任何黄金标准翻译参考。目前的QE模型是监督的：它们需要对一些数据集上某些MT系统输出进行人类标注质量来进行培训，使它们与域相关和MT系统相关。有研究对无监督的QE进行了研究，需要玻璃盒访问MT系统，或者使用并行MT数据来生成合成错误以训练QE模型。本文介绍了一种基于摄动的QE方法-一种词级质量估计方法，它可以通过分析扰动的输入源句子上MT系统输出来工作。我们的方法是无监督的、可解释的，并可以评估任何类型的黑盒MT系统，包括目前占主导地位的具有不透明内部过程的大型语言模型（LLMs）。对于没有标记QE数据的语言方向，我们的方法表现相似或更好的零-shot监督系统。我们还展示了如何使用基于摄动的QE作为反馈信号，在无监督的领域自适应中改进MT系统的质量。",
