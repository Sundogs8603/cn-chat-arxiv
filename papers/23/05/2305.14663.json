There are multiple reasons for such disagreements, including the subjectivity of the task, difficult cases, unclear guidelines, and so on. Rather than simply aggregating labels to obtain data annotations, we instead propose to explicitly account for the annotator idiosyncrasies and leverage them in the modeling process. We create representations for the annotators (annotator embeddings) and their annotations (annotation embeddings) with learnable matrices associated with each. Our approach significantly improves model performance on various NLP benchmarks by adding fewer than 1% model parameters. By capturing the unique tendencies and subjectivity of individual annotators, our embeddings help democratize AI and ensure that AI models are inclusive of diverse viewpoints.",

    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言处理（NLP）任务中，注释者的不一致是普遍存在的。存在多种原因导致注释者的不同意见，包括任务的主观性、困难案例、不明确的指南等等。我们的方法不是仅仅汇总注释的标签来获得数据注释，而是提议要明确考虑注释者特征，并在建模过程中利用它们。我们利用可学习的矩阵分别为注释者（注释者嵌入）和其注释（注释嵌入）创建表示。我们的方法通过使用少于1％的模型参数，在各种NLP基准测试中显著提高了模型性能。通过捕捉单个注释者的独特倾向和主观性，我们的嵌入有助于民主化人工智能，并确保人工智能模型包含多元化的观点。",
