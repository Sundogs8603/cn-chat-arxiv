    "translated_abstract": "在应用经济学和其他领域中，广泛使用使用协变量适应性随机化（CAR）的实验。在这种实验中，实验者首先根据观察到的基线协变量对样本进行分层，然后在这些分层内随机分配治疗，以达到按预先规定的分层特定目标分配比例平衡。本文计算二进制处理情况下考虑在Bugni、Canay和Shaikh（2018, 2019）中考虑的CAR程序类中平均处理效应（ATE）的半参数效率边界，这是一种广泛使用的程序类，并且受到实践的启发。在这些试验中，分层特定的目标比例在所有基线协变量（而不仅仅是分层）的条件下扮演概率得分的角色。因此，效率边界是Hahn（1998）中边界的特例，但在所有基线协变量的条件下。此外，我们提出了一种半参数估计器，用于在CAR过程下实现效率界限，并开发了一种数据驱动的方法来选择目标分配比例。我们的估计器计算效率高，可以处理大量的分层和协变量。通过模拟研究，我们证明了估计器的有限样本性能，并将我们的方法应用于现实世界的实验。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an efficient semiparametric estimator for the average treatment effect under covariate adaptive randomization (CAR), which can handle a large number of strata and covariates. The efficiency bound is computed and a data-driven approach is developed for choosing the target assignment proportions. The proposed estimator achieves the efficiency bound and is demonstrated through simulation and real-world experiments."
