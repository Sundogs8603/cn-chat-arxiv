    "translated_abstract": "两个概率分布之间的切片Wasserstein距离被定义为这两个分布的一维投影的Wasserstein距离的期望。随机性来自于用于将两个输入分布投影到一维的投影方向。由于期望的不可计算性，蒙特卡罗积分被用来估计SW距离的值。尽管有各种各样的变体，但没有先前的工作在控制切片Wasserstein距离的方差方面改进了蒙特卡罗估计方案。为了连通方差降低和切片Wasserstein距离的相关文献，我们提出了计算效率高的控制变量，以减少SW距离的经验估计的方差。其核心思想是首先找到投影后的一维分布的高斯近似，然后利用两个高斯分布之间Wasserstein-2距离的封闭形式。",
