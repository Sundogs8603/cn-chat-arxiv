    "translated_abstract": "本文在组合配置的最小方差投资组合背景下，对不同的协方差和精度矩阵估计方法进行了综合研究。我们研究的模型集可以广泛地分为基于高斯图模型（GGM）的方法、缩小方法、阈值和随机矩阵理论（RMT）的方法等。在这些方法中，GGM方法直接估计精度矩阵，而其他方法估计协方差矩阵。我们进行了合成实验，研究了GGM方法的网络学习和样本复杂度表现。然后，我们比较了所有协方差和精度矩阵估计方法在日、周和月视角下的预测能力。我们认为投资组合风险是估计误差的指标，并将其作为比较所考虑的方法的损失函数。我们发现，GGM方法优于压缩和其他方法。我们对GGM方法在各个时间视角下的表现进行了观察。",
