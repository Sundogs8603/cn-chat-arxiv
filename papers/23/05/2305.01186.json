    "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between student perceptions and their intention to use generative AI in higher education. Drawing on Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT), a questionnaire was developed to measure students' knowledge of generative AI, perceived value, and perceived cost. A sample of 405 students participated in the study, and confirmatory factor analysis was used to validate the constructs. The results indicate a strong positive correlation between perceived value and intention to use generative AI, and a weak negative correlation between perceived cost and intention to use. As we continue to explore the implications of generative AI in education and other domains, it is crucial to carefully consider the potential long-term consequences and the ethical dilemmas that may arise from widespread adoption.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在探究学生对于在高等教育中使用生成式人工智能的看法与意愿之间的关系。我们采用期望价值理论（EVT）开发了一份问卷，用于测量学生对生成式人工智能的知识、感知价值和感知成本。共有405名学生参与了本研究，确认性因素分析被用来验证构建的因素。结果表明，学生对生成式人工智能的感知价值和使用意愿之间存在强烈的正相关性，而感知成本与使用意愿之间则存在弱负相关性。在我们持续探索生成式人工智能在教育和其他领域的应用影响时，需要仔细考虑潜在的长期影响和可能导致的伦理困境。",

Results showed that students perceived generative AI as having high value and low perceived cost, but potential long-term consequences and ethical dilemmas should be carefully considered when promoting its widespread adoption."
