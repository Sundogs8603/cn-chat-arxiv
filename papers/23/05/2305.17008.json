    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了NormBank，一个包含155k个情境规范的知识库。该资源旨在为交互式、辅助和协作智能系统提供灵活的规范推理支持。与先前的常识资源不同，NormBank将每个推理嵌入到多元化的社会文化框架中，包括场景（例如，餐厅）、参与者的角色（服务员、顾客）、他们的属性（年龄、性别）以及其他物理、社会和文化约束（例如，温度或运营国家）。NormBank总共包含了来自我们引入和迭代完善的分类法的63k个独特约束。这些约束以不同的组合应用于构建社会规范。经过这些操作，规范是非单调的-即使稍微更新其框架也可以取消推理。尽管如此，我们发现神经模型可以可靠地扩展NormBank的范围和覆盖率。我们进一步通过一个示例展示了这个资源的实用性。",
