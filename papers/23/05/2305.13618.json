Here, we show how optimal decision making depends on knowledge about vaccination timing in a differential game in which individual decision making gives rise to Nash equilibria, and the arrival of the vaccine is described by a probability distribution. We show that the earlier the vaccination is expected to happen and the more precisely the timing of the vaccination is known, the stronger is the incentive to socially distance.

    "translated_abstract": "在疫情期间，人们会减少社交和经济活动以降低感染风险。这些社交距离策略将依赖于疫情进展的信息，同时也取决于人们预计疫情何时会结束，例如由于疫苗接种。通常情况下，由于可用信息不完全且不确定，很难做出最优决策。本文展示了最优决策如何依赖于对疫苗接种时间的了解，研究了一种微分博弈，并建立了个体决策和纳什均衡。本文表明，预计接种时间越早，且接种时间知道的越准确，人们遵守社交距离的动力越强。特别需要注意的是，在疫苗接种预计早于疫情结束之前，均衡社交距离仅会与无接种策略均衡有实质性偏差。",
