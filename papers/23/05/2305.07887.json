    "translated_abstract": "同行评审是科学研究的重要组成部分。同行评审的质量，以及发表的研究质量，很大程度上取决于能否招募到适当的审稿人来评审提交的论文。然而，由于科学论文的持续增加以及学者的工作负担不断增加等多种因素，找到这样的审稿人变得越来越困难。为了缓解这些挑战，解决自动将论文与“最匹配”的审稿人关联的问题（通常称为审稿人分配问题RAP）的解决方案已经成为研究的主题三十年了。尽管已经提出了许多解决方案，但据我们所知，缺少最近的RAP相关文献的系统综合。为了填补这一空白并支持进一步的RAP相关研究，在本文中，我们介绍了解决RAP的计算方法的综述研究。根据最新的综述方法论指南，我们检查了相关领域的文献，并提供了有关RAP领域发现的概述。",
