    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶车辆的发展有潜力彻底改变交通，但目前无法确保安全和高效的驾驶风格。可靠的预测人类行为的模型对于解决这个问题至关重要。尽管数据驱动的模型通常用于此目的，但在安全关键的边界情况下，它们可能会存在风险。这引发了对整合认知理论的模型的兴趣，但由于这些模型通常是为解释性目的而开发的，因此这种方法在行为预测方面的有效性在很大程度上尚未经过测试。在本文中，我们研究了\"Commotions\"模型的实用性，这是一个引入了最新的人类感知、决策和运动控制理论的认知合理的模型，用于预测交通中的人类行为，包括车道变更和交叉路口等许多重要的交通互动。我们展示了该模型能够与甚至超越已有模型竞争的能力。",
