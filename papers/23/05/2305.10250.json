    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型的革命性进展极大地改变了我们与人工智能系统的互动方式。尽管如此，其中一个明显的不足之处是这些模型缺乏长期记忆机制。这在需要持续互动的情况下尤为明显，例如个人伴侣系统和心理咨询。因此，我们提出了MemoryBank，这是一种专为LLM量身定制的新型内存机制。MemoryBank可以召唤相关记忆，通过持续的记忆更新不断进化，通过合成过去的互动信息理解并适应用户个性。为了模仿人类行为并有选择地保存记忆，MemoryBank采用了受Ebbinghaus遗忘曲线理论启发的记忆更新机制，这样人工智能可以根据时间和记忆的相对重要性来遗忘和加强记忆，从而为LLM提供类似于人类的长期记忆。",
