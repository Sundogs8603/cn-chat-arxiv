    "translated_abstract": "大语言模型（LLMs）已成为自然语言处理（NLP）领域强大的工具，并在推荐系统领域引起了重视。这些模型使用自监督学习在海量数据上进行训练，已在学习通用表示方面取得了显着成功，并有可能通过一些有效的转移技术（如微调和提示调整）等手段提高推荐系统的各个方面的性能。利用大语言模型增强推荐质量的关键是利用它们高质量的文本特征表示和大量的外部知识覆盖，建立项目和用户之间的相关性。为了全面了解现有基于LLM的推荐系统，本综述提出了一种分类法，将这些模型分为两种主要范式，分别是判别式LLMs和生成式LLMs。此外，我们总结了这些范式的最新进展，并强调了这个新兴领域的挑战和开放性研究问题。",
