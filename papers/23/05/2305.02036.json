    "translated_abstract": "先前解决对话系统中转换及响应生成的方法通常将其视为两个阶段的过程：首先通过对话历史来检测一轮对话是否已结束，然后系统生成一个合适的响应。然而，人类不仅仅因为很可能轮到自己了就发言，还要考虑自己想说的话是否适合当前位置。本文提出了一种模型（TurnGPT的扩展），它基于对话历史和下一个发言者要说的内容来预测一轮对话何时结束。我们发现，我们的模型在各种指标方面一直表现优异。在两种情景下，我们的模型的改进尤为显著，这两种情景下轮换预测仅由对话历史可能表现为模棱两可的：1）当前话语中包含陈述句和紧接着的疑问句；2）当前话语的结尾和所需响应在语义上匹配。将交替预测和响应排序视为一个阶段的过程，我们的模型在Stanford对话数据集中取得了最优秀的结果。",
