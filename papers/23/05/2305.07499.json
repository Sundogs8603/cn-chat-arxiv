    "translated_abstract": "对于音频分类模型而言，广泛适用于各种录音设备是关键性能因素。不同类型的麦克风特性由于其不同的频率响应，会引入数字化音频信号的分布差异。如果在训练期间不考虑此领域偏移，那么当它用于未见过的设备记录音频时，模型的性能可能会严重下降。特别是，在少数不同麦克风上录制音频信号的模型训练可能会使泛化到未被训练的设备困难。为解决这个问题，我们使用预录制设备脉冲响应(DIR)卷积训练集中的音频信号，从而人工增加录音设备的多样性。我们系统地研究了使用CNN和音频光谱变换进行Acoustic Scene Classification任务的DIR增强效果。结果表明，仅使用DIR增强就能提升模型在未见过设备上的性能。",
