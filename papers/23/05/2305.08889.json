    "translated_abstract": "“数据是新的石油”，简言之，数据是持续进行的第四次工业革命的重要来源，这导致一些评论员过于快速地将数据量视为财富本身，并认为大数据的发展是利润的几乎直接原因。人力资源管理也没有逃脱这一趋势，对员工大量数据的积累被某些企业家视为构建预测复杂工作行为（如旷工或工作绩效）的模型所必需的充分条件。事实上，这种类比有点误导人：与石油不同，这里不存在有关数据产生的重大问题（其流量由各种信息系统持续且低成本地生成），而是它们的“精炼”，即将这些数据转化为有用的产品，即知识所需的操作。这种转变是人力资源管理研究方法论挑战所在。在本文中，我们提供了定量归纳方法的概述与示范，例如因子分析、聚类分析和潜在类别分析。我们认为这些方法为“大数据”时代的人力资源管理研究提供了潜在的前进方向。",
