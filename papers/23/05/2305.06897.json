    "abstract": "African languages have far less in-language content available digitally, making it challenging for question answering systems to satisfy the information needs of users. Cross-lingual open-retrieval question answering (XOR QA) systems -- those that retrieve answer content from other languages while serving people in their native language -- offer a means of filling this gap. To this end, we create AfriQA, the first cross-lingual QA dataset with a focus on African languages. AfriQA includes 12,000+ XOR QA examples across 10 African languages. While previous datasets have focused primarily on languages where cross-lingual QA augments coverage from the target language, AfriQA focuses on languages where cross-lingual answer content is the only high-coverage source of answer content. Because of this, we argue that African languages are one of the most important and realistic use cases for XOR QA.

    "translated_abstract": "数字化的非洲语言内容远远不足，这使得问答系统难以满足用户的信息需求。跨语言开放检索问答（XOR QA）系统--这些系统可以在为人们提供本地语言服务的同时从其他语言中获取答案内容--提供了一种填补这一差距的手段。为此，我们创建了AfriQA，这是第一个专注于非洲语言的跨语言QA数据集。AfriQA包括10种非洲语言的12,000多个XOR QA示例。尽管先前的数据集主要关注交叉语言QA增强目标语言覆盖范围的语言，但AfriQA侧重于交叉语言答案内容是唯一高覆盖范围答案内容的语言。因此，我们认为非洲语言是XOR QA中最重要和最现实的用例之一。我们的实验证明了自动翻译和多语言检索系统在我们的数据集上表现不佳，突显了需要支持跨语言推理和转移学习的模型。",

    "en_tdlr": "AfriQA is the first cross-lingual QA dataset focusing on African languages, filling the gap of inadequate digital content for African languages. Poor performance of automatic translation and multilingual retrieval systems on the dataset suggests the need for models supporting cross-lingual reasoning and transfer learning."
