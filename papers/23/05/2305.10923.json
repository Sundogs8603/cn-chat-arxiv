    "translated_abstract": "查询性能预测(QPP)是信息检索中的一个核心任务。QPP的任务是在没有相关判断的情况下预测查询的检索质量。研究表明，QPP在Ad-hoc搜索中非常有效和有用。近年来，对话式搜索(CS)取得了相当大的进展 。有效的QPP能够帮助CS系统在下一轮决定适当的行动。尽管具有潜力，但CS的QPP研究还很少。本文通过重现和研究现有的QPP方法在CS上的有效性来填补这一研究空白。虽然在两种情况下的通道检索任务相同，但CS中的用户查询取决于对话历史，引入了新的QPP挑战。我们尤其是探讨从Ad-hoc搜索中QPP方法的研究结果在三个CS设置中的推广程度:(i) 评估基于查询重写的检索方法的不同查询的检索质量",
