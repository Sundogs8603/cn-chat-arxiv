    "abstract": "This research introduces a novel pairs trading strategy based on copulas for cointegrated pairs of cryptocurrencies. To identify the most suitable pairs, the study employs linear and non-linear cointegration tests along with a correlation coefficient measure and fits different copula families to generate trading signals formulated from a reference asset for analyzing the mispricing index. The strategy's performance is then evaluated by conducting back-testing for various triggers of opening positions, assessing its returns and risks. The findings indicate that the proposed method outperforms buy-and-hold trading strategies in terms of both profitability and risk-adjusted returns.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种基于Copula的新型加密货币协整交易策略。为了确定最合适的交易对，该研究采用线性和非线性协整检验以及相关系数测量，并适用不同的Copula家族来生成交易信号，该信号由参考资产组成，用于分析错配指数。然后，通过对不同开仓触发器进行回测评估其收益和风险来评估策略的表现。研究结果表明，所提出的方法在盈利能力和风险调整回报率方面优于买入持有交易策略。",
