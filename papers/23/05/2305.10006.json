    "translated_abstract": "视频快照压缩成像 (SCI) 使用二维检测器在单个曝光时间内捕获连续视频帧。然后需要设计高效的重建算法来重建所需的视频帧。虽然最近的基于深度学习的最新重建算法已经在大多数任务上取得了良好的结果，但它们仍然面临以下挑战：过度的模型复杂性和GPU内存限制。其中，1)这些模型需要高计算成本，2)它们通常不能在高压缩比下重建大规模的视频帧。为了解决这些问题，我们开发了一种高效的视频SCI网络，使用单个残差块内的稠密连接和时空分解机制，命名为EfficientSCI。 EfficientSCI网络可以通过在空间域中使用卷积和在时间域中使用转换域稀疏化（TDS）来很好地建立空间 - 时间相关性，这显著降低了计算成本和内存使用。实验结果表明，我们的EfficientSCI在各种大规模视频SCI数据集上，在重建质量和计算效率方面均优于最新的基于深度学习的方法。",
