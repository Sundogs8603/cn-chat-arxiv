    "translated_abstract": "数据科学的采用为中小型企业带来了巨大的好处，包括提高业务生产力、促进经济增长、创新和创造就业机会。数据科学可以支持中小企业优化生产流程，预测客户需求，预测机器故障并提供高效的智能服务。企业还可以利用人工智能和大数据的力量以及智能使用数字技术来提高生产力和业务表现，为创新铺平道路。然而，将数据科学决策整合到中小企业中需要技能和IT投资。在大多数情况下，由于资源有限和融资渠道受限，这些费用超出了中小企业的负担范围。本文以英国西米德兰地区为主要案例研究85家中小企业，提出了针对组织有效数据驱动决策的趋势和挑战。该工作是作为3年ERDF（欧洲区域发展基金）计划的一部分资助的。",
