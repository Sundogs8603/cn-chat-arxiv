    "abstract": "Identifying important nodes with strong propagation capabilities in road networks is a significant topic in the field of urban planning. However, existing methods for evaluating nodes importance consider only topological information and traffic volumes, ignoring the diversity of characteristics in road networks, such as the number of lanes and average speed of road segments, limiting their performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a graph learning-based node ranking method (MGL2Rank) that integrates the rich characteristics of the road network. In this method, we first develop a sampling algorithm (MGWalk) that utilizes multi-graph fusion to establish association between road segments based on their attributes. Then, an embedding module is proposed to learn latent representation for each road segment. Finally, the obtained node representation is used to learn importance ranking of road segments.

    "translated_abstract": "在城市规划领域中，识别具有强传播能力的重要节点是一个重要的课题。然而，现有的评估节点重要性的方法仅考虑拓扑信息和交通流量，忽略了道路网络的多样性特征，如车道数量和道路段的平均速度，限制了它们的性能。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种基于图学习的节点排序方法（MGL2Rank），它集成了道路网络的丰富特征。在这种方法中，我们首先开发了一个采样算法（MGWalk），利用多图融合来建立基于属性的道路段之间的关联。然后，提出了一个嵌入模块，用于学习每个道路段的潜在表示。最后，得到的节点表示用于学习道路段的重要性排序。我们在中国沈阳市区域道路网络上进行了仿真实验，评估了MGL2Rank的有效性。实验结果表明，MGL2Rank在精度和效率方面优于现有的节点排序方法。",
