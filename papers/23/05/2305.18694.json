    "translated_abstract": "神经算子已经成为求解偏微分方程中函数空间映射的有力工具。但是，当面临现实世界的物理数据时，这些数据往往分布非常不均匀，使用基于网格的技术（如FFT）很具有挑战性。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了Non-Uniform Neural Operator (NUNO)，这是一个专门用于处理非均匀数据的高效算子学习框架。通过利用基于K-D树的域分解，我们将非均匀数据转换成均匀网格，同时有效地控制插值误差，从而可以与从非均匀数据学习的速度和准确性并行。我们在二维弹性、(2+1)D河道流和三维多物理 heatsink 上进行了大量的实验，这些实验涉及复杂几何结构的三维偏微分方程问题。我们的框架将误差率降低了最多60％，并将训练速度提高了2倍至30倍。代码现在在https://github.com 上可用。",
