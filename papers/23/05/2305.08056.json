    "translated_abstract": "在使用量子算法处理二元优化问题时，传统的 Ising 表示和量子近似优化算法（QAOA）在处理涉及多个约束的大规模问题的错误时遇到了困难。为了解决这些挑战，本论文提出了一个混合框架，该框架结合了使用标准 Ising 哈密顿量来解决一部分约束的使用，同时采用非 Ising 表述来表示和解决剩余的约束。通过罚款淬灭或量子泽诺效应来解决这些非 Ising 约束。这种创新方法导致了一系列可适应结构的量子电路，具体取决于所选约束的表示形式。此外，本文介绍了一种利用量子泽诺效应的新技术，通过频繁测量约束标志，实现对任何优化约束的解决。理论上，我们展示了该算法的实际性能表现优于传统算法，有望在解决一类带有多个约束的硬优化问题时发挥重要作用。",
