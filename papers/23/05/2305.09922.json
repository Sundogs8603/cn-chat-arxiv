However, traditional Michigan approaches tend to evolve large rule bases that are difficult to interpret or scale to domains beyond standard mazes. A Pittsburgh Genetic Fuzzy System (dubbed Fuzzy MoCoCo) is proposed that utilises both multiobjective and cooperative coevolutionary mechanisms to evolve fuzzy rule-based policies for RL environments. Multiobjectivity in the system is concerned with policy performance vs. complexity. The continuous state RL environment Mountain Car is used as a testing bed for the proposed system. Results show the system is able to effectively explore the trade-off between policy performance and complexity, and learn interpretable, high-performing policies that use as few rules as possible.",

    "translated_abstract": "强化学习（RL）正经历着研究兴趣的复苏，学习分类器系统（LCS）已经被应用多年。然而，传统的密歇根方法往往会演化成大量的规则库，这些规则库难以解释或扩展到超出标准迷宫之外的领域。提出了一种匹兹堡基因模糊系统，名为Fuzzy MoCoCo，其利用多目标和合作协同进化机制，为RL环境演化模糊规则策略。系统中的多目标与策略性能与复杂性有关。连续状态的RL环境Mountain Car被用作测试基础。结果表明，该系统能够有效探索策略性能与复杂性之间的权衡，并学习出可解释的，高性能的策略，并尽可能少地使用规则。",
