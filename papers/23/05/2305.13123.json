    "abstract": "We are interested in the nonparametric estimation of the probability density of price returns, using the kernel approach. The output of the method heavily relies on the selection of a bandwidth parameter. Many selection methods have been proposed in the statistical literature. We put forward an alternative selection method based on a criterion coming from information theory and from the physics of complex systems: the bandwidth to be selected maximizes a new measure of complexity, with the aim of avoiding both overfitting and underfitting. We review existing methods of bandwidth selection and show that they lead to contradictory conclusions regarding the complexity of the probability distribution of price returns. This has also some striking consequences in the evaluation of the relevance of the efficient market hypothesis. We apply these methods to real financial data, focusing on the Bitcoin.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在使用核方法非参数地估计价格回报的概率密度。该方法的输出严重依赖于带宽参数的选择。统计学文献中提出了许多选择方法。我们提出了一种基于信息理论和复杂系统物理的准则的备选选择方法：所选带宽最大化了一种新的复杂性度量，旨在避免过度拟合和欠拟合。本文回顾了现有的带宽选择方法，并表明它们对于价格回报的概率分布的复杂性会得出自相矛盾的结论。这在评估有效市场假说的相关性方面也有一些惊人的后果。我们将这些方法应用于比特币等真实金融数据。",
