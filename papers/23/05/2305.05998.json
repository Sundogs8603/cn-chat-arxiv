    "abstract": "This paper is the first study to examine the time instability of the APT in the Japanese stock market. In particular, we measure how changes in each risk factor affect the stock risk premiums to investigate the validity of the APT over time, applying the rolling window method to Fama and MacBeth's (1973) two-step regression and Kamstra and Shi's (2023) generalized GRS test. We summarize our empirical results as follows: (1) the APT is supported over the entire sample period but not at all times, (2) the changes in monetary policy greatly affect the validity of the APT in Japan, and (3) the time-varying estimates of the risk premiums for each factor are also unstable over time, and they are affected by the business cycle and economic crises. Therefore, we conclude that the validity of the APT as an appropriate model to explain the Japanese sector index is not stable over time.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文是第一篇研究在日本股票市场中考察APT时间不稳定性的论文。具体而言，我们采用Fama和MacBeth（1973）的两步回归和Kamstra和Shi（2023）的广义GRS测试方法，衡量每个风险因子变化对股票风险溢价的影响，以考察APT的有效性随时间的变化。我们总结我们的实证结果如下：（1）APT在整个样本期间得到支持，但并不总是有效的；（2）货币政策的变化在日本影响APT的有效性；（3）每个因子的风险溢价的时变估计也不稳定，受到商业周期和经济危机的影响。因此，我们得出结论，APT作为解释日本股票市场的适当模型的有效性随时间的变化并不稳定。",
