Using a real-world dataset, this research aims to identify the factors that influence building cost reduction and energy consumption.

    "translated_abstract": "优化能耗和协调公用事业系统一直是建筑行业关注的焦点。建筑是世界上最大的能源消耗者之一，其能效对于防止浪费和降低成本至关重要。此外，建筑物产生大量的原始数据，可以用于了解能源消耗模式并协助开发优化策略。本研究利用真实世界的数据集，旨在识别影响建筑物成本降低和能耗的因素。为实现这一目标，我们利用三种回归模型（Lasso回归、决策树和随机森林）来预测建筑物的主要燃料使用、电能消耗和成本节省。进行了一项影响能耗和成本降低因素的分析，并使用元启发式算法优化决策树算法。通过使用元启发技术，我们对决策树算法进行微调，以实现更好的模型精度和可解释性。结果表明，影响建筑物能耗和成本降低的关键因素是隔热、建筑物尺寸和使用的制冷系统类型。",
