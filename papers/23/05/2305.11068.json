    "abstract": "The purpose of this work is to describe the Orkg-Leaderboard software designed to extract leaderboards defined as Task-Dataset-Metric tuples automatically from large collections of empirical research papers in Artificial Intelligence (AI). The software can support both the main workflows of scholarly publishing, viz. as LaTeX files or as PDF files. Furthermore, the system is integrated with the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) platform, which fosters the machine-actionable publishing of scholarly findings. Thus the system output, when integrated within the ORKG's supported Semantic Web infrastructure of representing machine-actionable 'resources' on the Web, enables: 1) broadly, the integration of empirical results of researchers across the world, thus enabling transparency in empirical research with the potential to also being complete contingent on the underlying data source(s) of publications; and 2) specifically, enables researchers to track the progress in AI with an overview ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了 ORKG-Leaderboard 软件，它旨在从人工智能领域的大量实证研究论文中自动提取以任务-数据集-度量元组为定义的排行榜。该软件支持学术出版的主要工作流程，即 LaTeX 文件或 PDF 文件。此外，该系统还与 Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) 平台集成，该平台促进了学术发现的机器可操作性出版。因此，当系统输出与 ORKG 支持的语义 web 基础设施相结合时，它可以实现两个方面的功能：1）横跨全球的研究人员的实证结果的集成，从而实现实证研究的透明度，并有可能是完整的；2）让研究人员了解人工智能的进展情况。",
