In this paper, we present a novel approach for learning hard, axis-aligned DTs with gradient descent.

    "translated_abstract": "决策树是用于许多机器学习任务的常见工具，因为它们具有高度的解释性。然而，从数据中学习决策树是一个困难的优化问题，因为它是非凸和非可微的。因此，通常的方法是使用一种贪婪生长算法来学习决策树，在每个内部节点上局部最小化不纯度。不幸的是，这种贪心过程可能会导致次优的决策树。在本文中，我们提出了一种使用梯度下降学习难以处理的轴对齐决策树的新方法。所提出的方法使用反向传播和直通算子在密集的决策树表示上联合优化所有树的参数。我们的方法在二分类基准测试上优于现有方法，并在多类任务中实现了有竞争力的结果。",
