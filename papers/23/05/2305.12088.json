    "translated_abstract": "本文利用数学准确性和博弈论策略洞察力，探讨了开放获取学术出版中的评审奖励领域。我们将现有的代金券奖励系统概念化为一个两个玩家的博弈，并识别了可能导致评审人员倾向于二元决策的潜在缺点。为解决这个问题，我们提出并数学上形式化了一种替代奖励系统，旨在减轻这种偏见，促进更全面的审查。我们运用严格的博弈论分析和深度强化学习模拟，对两种系统的属性和结果进行了详细的研究。我们的结果强调了两种系统之间的显着差异，我们提出的系统展现出了更平衡的决策分配和更加稳定的特点。这项研究不仅扩充了有关评审奖励系统的数学理解，而且提供了解决当前代金券奖励系统偏见问题的潜在解决方案。",
