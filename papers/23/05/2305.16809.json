    "abstract": "When caregivers ask open--ended questions to motivate dialogue with children, it facilitates the child's reading comprehension skills.Although there is scope for use of technological tools, referred here as \"intelligent tutoring systems\", to scaffold this process, it is currently unclear whether existing intelligent systems that generate human--language like questions is beneficial. Additionally, training data used in the development of these automated question generation systems is typically sourced without attention to demographics, but people with different cultural backgrounds may ask different questions. As a part of a broader project to design an intelligent reading support app for Latinx children, we crowdsourced questions from Latinx caregivers and noncaregivers as well as caregivers and noncaregivers from other demographics. We examine variations in question--asking within this dataset mediated by individual, cultural, and contextual factors. We then design a system that autom",

    "translated_abstract": "当照顾者询问开放式问题以激发与孩子的对话时，可以促进孩子的阅读理解能力。虽然有利用技术工具来支持这个过程，即所谓的“智能辅导系统”的空间，但目前仍不清楚现有的生成类人语言问题的智能系统是否有益。此外，用于开发这些自动生成问题系统的培训数据通常没有考虑到人口统计学，但具有不同文化背景的人可能会提出不同的问题。作为为拉丁裔儿童设计智能阅读支持应用程序的广泛项目的一部分，我们从来自不同人口统计学的拉丁裔护理人员和非护理人员以及其他人口统计学背景的护理人员和非护理人员中群集大量问题。我们研究了这个数据集中个体、文化和环境因素中介的问题提问的变化。然后我们设计了一个系统来自动产生问题。",
