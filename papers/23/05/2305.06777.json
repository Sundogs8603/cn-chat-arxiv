We proposed methods for adaptive data acquisition and reflectance correction respectively, to generate high-quality 3D multispectral point clouds (3DMPCs) of plants. In the first stage, we proposed an efficient next-best-view (NBV) planning method based on a novel UGV platform with a multi-sensor-equipped robotic arm. In the second stage, we eliminated the illumination effects by using the neural reference field (NeREF) to predict the digital number (DN) of the reference. We tested them on 6 perilla and 6 tomato plants, and selected 2 visible leaves and 4 regions of interest",

    "translated_abstract": "使用高质量的三维（3D）和多光谱数据对植物表型特征进行非破坏性评估可以加深育种者对植物生长的理解，并使他们能够做出知情管理决策。然而，在自然光照条件下，主观视角选择和复杂的光照效应会降低数据质量，增加解决表型参数的难度。我们提出了自适应数据采集和反射校正的方法，以分别生成植物的高质量3D多光谱点云（3DMPCs）。在第一阶段，我们提出了一种基于新型UGV平台和多传感器装备的机器人臂的高效的下一个最佳视角（NBV）规划方法。在第二阶段，我们通过使用神经参考场（NeREF）来预测参考的数字（DN）来消除光照效应。我们在6个紫苏和6个番茄植株上进行了测试，并选择了2片可见叶和4个感兴趣的区域。",
