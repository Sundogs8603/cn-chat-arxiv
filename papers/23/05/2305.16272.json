    "translated_abstract": "协同学习技术能够让机器学习模型的训练比仅利用单一数据源的模型效果更好。然而，在许多情况下，潜在的参与者是下游任务中的竞争对手，如每个都希望通过提供最佳推荐来吸引客户的公司。这可能会激励不诚实的更新，损害其他参与者的模型，从而可能破坏协作的好处。在这项工作中，我们制定了一个模型来描述这种交互，并在该框架内研究了两个学习任务：单轮均值估计和强凸目标的多轮 SGD。对于一类自然的参与者行为，我们发现理性的客户会被激励强烈地操纵他们的更新，从而防止学习。然后，我们提出了机制来激励诚实沟通，并确保学习质量与全面合作相当。最后，我们通过实验证明了这一点。",
