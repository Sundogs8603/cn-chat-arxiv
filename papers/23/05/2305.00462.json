    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了一个灵活的框架，用于定义1-Laplacian超图，其中包括依赖于边的顶点权重。这些权重能够反映超边内顶点的不同重要性，从而使得超图模型比同质超图具有更高的表现力。本文利用与超图1-Laplacian第二小特征值相关的特征向量对顶点进行聚类。从基于规范化的Cheeger割的理论角度来看，这种方法的聚类精度应比传统拉普拉斯方法更高。实验证明，我们使用实际数据集证实了该谱聚类方法的有效性。此外，我们还展示了在我们框架内一个特殊情况下，相应的超图1-Laplacian等价于一个相关图的1-Laplacian，该图的特征向量能够更有效地计算，从而简化了计算。",
