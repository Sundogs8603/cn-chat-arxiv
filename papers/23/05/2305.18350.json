    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的电子商务产品属性挖掘任务设置，用于提取开放世界属性，同时减少人工干预。我们的监督来自于现有资源中引导的高质量种子属性集合，旨在扩展现有种子类型的属性词汇，并通过自动方式发现任何新的属性类型。我们创建了一个新数据集以支持我们的设置，并提出了特定于受限监督的Amacer方法。尤其是，由于那些未见过的新属性没有直接监督，我们的新颖公式利用了自我监督启发式和无监督潜在属性，利用产品上下文获得额外的隐含语义信号作为辅助监督。实验表明，我们的方法在F1值上超过了各种基线方法12个百分点，使现有类型的属性大大扩展了最多12倍，并且发现新属性值的能力达到了39％。",

The approach, Amacer, utilizes self-supervised heuristic and unsupervised latent attributes to expand the attribute vocabulary of existing types and discover new attribute types. The experiments show that Amacer outperforms various baselines by 12 F1 and can expand existing types of attributes up to 12 times, while discovering new attribute values with a 39% success rate."
