    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种适用于具有术语约束的翻译的即插即用方法。术语约束是许多现代翻译流程的重要方面，在专业领域和新兴领域（如COVID-19疫情）中，准确翻译专业术语至关重要。最近的方法通常训练模型从输入中复制术语并将其馈送到目标语句中。但这需要昂贵的培训，每当基础语言模型发生变化或系统需要专门化到新领域时都需要重新训练。我们提出级联束搜索，一种即插即用的术语强制方法，不需要训练。这种级联束搜索有两个部分：1）逻辑操作，增加目标术语的概率；2）基于网格束搜索的级联束设置，其中根据它们包含的术语数将束组合。我们通过竞争方式评估了我们的方法的性能。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种级联束搜索算法，用于神经机器翻译中的术语约束，可以即插即用，无需重新训练。该方法可将目标术语的概率增加，并使用基于网格束搜索的级联束设置，性能良好。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a plug-and-play terminology-forcing approach called Cascade Beam Search for neural machine translation with terminology constraints. This method requires no training and consists of logit manipulation to increase the probability of target terminologies and a cascading beam setup based on grid beam search. The proposed approach shows good performance in evaluation."
