    "abstract": "This study presents empirical evidence to support the validity of new definitions in financial markets. The risk attitudes of investors in US financial markets from 1889-1978 are analyzed and the results indicate that equity investors who invested in the composite S&P 500 index were risk-averse in 1977. Conversely, risk-free asset investors who invested in US Treasury bills were found to exhibit not enough risk-loving behavior, which can be considered a type of risk-averse behavior. These findings suggest that the new definitions in financial markets accurately reflect the behavior of investors and should be considered in investment strategies.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究给出了支持金融市场新定义的经验证据。分析了1889-1978年美国金融市场投资者的风险态度，结果表明，1977年在投资综合S＆P 500指数的股票投资者是风险规避者。相反，投资美国国债的无风险资产投资者则表现出不足的风险偏爱，这可以被认为是一种风险规避行为。这些发现表明，金融市场新定义准确反映了投资者的行为，应考虑在投资策略中。",
