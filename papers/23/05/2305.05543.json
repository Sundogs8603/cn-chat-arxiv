Our system achieves this by 1) enabling early diagnosis, 2) identifying early indicators of clinical severity, and 3) quantifying and tracking the progression of the disease across the ambulatory phase of the disease. To accomplish this, we employ an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based detection of gait characteristics in patients and typically developing peers. Our system remotely and in real-time collects data from device sensors (e.g., acceleration from a mobile device, etc.) using our novel Walk4Me API.

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了Walk4Me，这是一个远程康复社区行动能力评估系统，旨在促进早期诊断、严重性和进展识别。我们通过以下三个方法实现了这一目标：1）促进早期诊断；2）识别临床严重性的早期指标；3）量化和跟踪疾病在步行期的进展。为此，我们采用基于人工智能（AI）的步态特征检测来检测患者和通常发育的同龄人的行走方式。我们的系统通过我们的新型Walk4Me API从设备传感器（例如移动设备的加速度等）远程实时收集数据。我们的Web应用程序提取时间/空间步态特征和原始数据信号特征，然后采用传统机器学习和深度学习技术来识别模式，以便实现：1）识别与疾病相关的步态障碍的患者；2）描述活动能力限制的程度；3）确定疾病的进展。",
