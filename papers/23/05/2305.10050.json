    "abstract": "Causal inference for testing clinical hypotheses from observational data presents many difficulties because the underlying data-generating model and the associated causal graph are not usually available. Furthermore, observational data may contain missing values, which impact the recovery of the causal graph by causal discovery algorithms: a crucial issue often ignored in clinical studies. In this work, we use data from a multi-centric study on endometrial cancer to analyze the impact of different missingness mechanisms on the recovered causal graph. This is achieved by extending state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms to exploit expert knowledge without sacrificing theoretical soundness. We validate the recovered graph with expert physicians, showing that our approach finds clinically-relevant solutions. Finally, we discuss the goodness of fit of our graph and its consistency from a clinical decision-making perspective using graphical separation to validate causal pathways.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于观测数据的数据生成模型和相关联的因果图通常不存在，因此从观测数据中检验临床假设的因果推断面临许多困难。此外，观测数据可能包含缺失的值，这会影响因果发现算法恢复因果图的效果，这是临床研究中经常被忽略的关键问题。针对这些问题，我们使用子宫内膜癌的多中心研究数据，分析不同缺失机制对恢复的因果图的影响。我们扩展了最先进的因果发现算法，利用专家知识而不损失理论的严谨性，验证了所恢复因果图的临床相关性。最后，我们使用图形分离来验证因果通路，讨论了因果图的拟合度和从临床决策角度的一致性。",
