    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of information in the digital era underscores the importance of accurate historical representation and interpretation. While artificial intelligence has shown promise in various fields, its potential for historical fact-checking and gap-filling remains largely untapped. This study evaluates the performance of three large language models LLMs GPT 3.5, GPT 4, and GoogleBARD in the context of predicting and verifying historical events based on given data. A novel metric, Distance to Reality (DTR), is introduced to assess the models' outputs against established historical facts. The results reveal a substantial potential for AI in historical studies, with GPT 4 demonstrating superior performance. This paper underscores the need for further research into AI's role in enriching our understanding of the past and bridging historical knowledge gaps.",

    "translated_abstract": "数字时代信息的迅速扩散凸显了准确的历史记录和解释的重要性。虽然人工智能已在各个领域展示出了潜力，但其在历史事实核查和填补空白方面的潜力仍然不为人知。本研究评估了三种大型语言模型LLMs，即 GPT 3.5、GPT 4和GoogleBARD，它们能够根据给定数据预测和验证历史事件的表现。引入了一种新的评估指标：与现实的距离（DTR），用于评估模型的输出结果与已有的历史事实是否一致。结果显示，AI在历史研究中具有巨大的潜力，其中GPT 4表现最为优异。本文强调了需要进一步研究AI在丰富我们对过去的理解和弥合历史知识差距方面的作用。",
