    "translated_abstract": "为了平衡质量和成本，科学和工程的多个领域会在多个复杂程度上运行模拟。多保真度主动学习旨在通过从多个保真度水平积极地获取数据来学习从输入参数到模拟输出的直接映射。然而，现有的基于高斯过程的方法很难扩展到高维数据。基于深度学习的方法通常在隐藏表示中强制实施分层结构，仅支持从低保真度到高保真度传递信息。这些方法可能导致从低保真度表示到高保真度表示中不良误差的传播。我们提出了一种称为解缠多保真度深度贝叶斯主动学习（D-MFDAL）的新框架，该框架学习了在多个保真度上函数分布的条件下的代理模型。在学习偏微分方程的深度代理的基准任务中，我们的方法展示了优越的性能，同时保留了高斯过程的灵活性和可解释性。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种新的框架D-MFDAL，它可以学习具有多个保真度的函数分布，相比于现有基于高斯过程的方法，该方法具有更好的性能和高斯过程的灵活性和可解释性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel framework called Disentangled Multi-fidelity Deep Bayesian Active Learning (D-MFDAL), which learns the surrogate models conditioned on the distribution of functions at multiple fidelities. Compared to existing Gaussian process-based methods, our approach demonstrates superior performance while preserving the flexibility and interpretability of Gaussian processes."
