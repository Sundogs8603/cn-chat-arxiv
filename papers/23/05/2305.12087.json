    "translated_abstract": "在回归任务中，由于某些连续标签值的观测很难收集，因此注释数据中很容易出现数据不平衡。在分子和聚合物属性预测中，注释的图形数据集通常很小，因为标注它们需要昂贵的设备和工作量。为了解决图形回归任务中稀有标签值示例不足的问题，我们提出了一种半监督框架，通过自我训练逐步平衡训练数据并减少模型偏差。训练数据的平衡通过以下方式实现：（1）用一种新的回归置信度测量方法为代表稀有标签的更多图形伪标注，并从不平衡的注释数据中逆分布采样它们的子集以识别未标注数据中的高质量样例；(2)在数据平衡后，使用伪标签的方法在潜在空间中增加图形，以生成更多的稀有标签示例，而无需手动标注。后者是利用潜在空间生成模型来人工生成更多的稀有标签示例。",
