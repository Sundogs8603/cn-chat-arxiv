    "translated_abstract": "车祸仍然是全球重大的公共安全问题，其中的大多数归因于驾驶员错误，包括不足的驾驶知识、不合规定以及不良驾驶习惯。为了提高道路安全性，多项驾驶行为检测（DBD）系统已经被提出，以识别安全和不安全的驾驶行为。这些研究中的许多利用了从控制器区域网络（CAN）总线获取的传感器数据来构建模型。然而，使用公共可用传感器已知会降低检测模型的准确性，而将供应商特定的传感器纳入数据集中则可以增加准确性。为了解决现有方法的局限性，我们提出了一个基于图卷积长短期记忆网络（GConvLSTM）的可靠DBD系统，利用公共传感器提高了DBD模型的精度和实用性。此外，我们还加入了非公共传感器来评估模型的有效性。",
