    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）已成为强大的生成人工智能解决方案，可应用于多个领域和工作领域。本文介绍了一项实验的结果和反思，该实验使用模型GPT 3.5-Turbo来模拟归纳式主题分析的某些方面。先前的研究在该主题上主要进行演绎分析。主题分析是一种在社会科学中常用的定性分析方法，它基于人类分析师的解释以及定性数据中的显式和潜在含义的识别。尝试使用LLM进行基于人类解释的分析显然是一种挑战，但也是了解这些系统在定性研究中能否使用的一种方式。本文介绍了尝试进行此模拟的动机，并反思了Braun和Clarke提出的六个步骤至少部分地如何进行主题分析的方法。",
