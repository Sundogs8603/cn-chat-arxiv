    "translated_abstract": "完全波形反演（FWI）是通过解决一个非凸优化问题从地震波形数据中推断地下结构信息的方法。数据驱动的FWI已经越来越被研究，使用不同的神经网络架构来提高准确性和计算效率。然而，预训练神经网络的适用性受到潜在的调查源函数和训练过程中使用的源函数之间的差异的严重限制。在这里，我们开发了一种傅里叶增强的深度算子网络（Fourier-DeepONet）用于全波形反演，并且具有地震源的泛化能力，包括地震源的频率和位置。具体而言，我们将傅里叶神经算子作为DeepONet的解码器，并利用源参数作为Fourier-DeepONet的其中一个输入，以实现对具有可变源的FWI的分辨率。为了测试Fourier-DeepONet，我们开发了两个新的逼真的FWI基准数据集（FWI-F和FWI-L），它们具有不同的源频率。",
