    "translated_abstract": "代码搜索是一个重要的任务，在近年来得到了很多发展。然而，以前的尝试主要考虑通过文本查询搜索代码的问题。我们认为，使用代码片段（可能伴随着回溯）作为查询，并寻找具有修复错误指令和代码示例的答案是一个自然的用例，而现有方法并未涵盖此类情况。此外，现有数据集使用从代码中提取的注释而不是全文描述作为文本，使它们不适用于这种用例。我们提出了一个基于StackOverflow数据实现搜索BySnippet用例的新SearchBySnippet数据集; 在这种情况下，现有体系结构即使在微调之后也不能与最简单的BM25基线相提并论。我们提出了一个新的单编码器模型SnippeR，它在SearchBySnippet数据集上优于几个强基线，结果为0.451 Recall@10; 我们建议将SearchBySnippet数据集和SnippeR作为新的重要基准数据集和模型来推广代码搜索。",
