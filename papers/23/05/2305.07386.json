    "translated_abstract": "二分图结构在促进大规模数据集的子空间聚类和谱聚类算法方面显示出了很大的潜力。为了避免二分图划分过程中需要使用k-means进行后处理，我们通常采用约束拉普拉斯秩（CLR）来限制二分图中连接成分（即簇）的数量，但CLR忽略了这些连接成分的分布（或规范化），可能导致不平衡甚至不良簇。尽管规范化切割（Ncut）在一般图中取得了显著的成功，但如何强制执行二分图的一步规范化切割，特别是具有线性时间复杂度，仍然是一个有待解决的问题。本文首先利用规范化约束表征了一种新的一步二分图切割(OBCut)准则，并在理论上证明了该准则与一个迹最大化问题的等价性。然后，我们将这种切割准则推广到可扩展子空间聚类中。",
