    "translated_abstract": "随着生成式预训练变换器（GPT）等大型语言模型技术的不断发展和变化，各个领域的许多经典场景重新展现出新的机遇。本文将ChatGPT作为建模对象，首次将LLM技术并入传统的图书资源理解和推荐场景中，并付诸实践。本文基于ChatGPT构建了类似于聊天机器人的图书推荐系统框架（BookGPT），试图将ChatGPT应用于三种典型任务的推荐建模：图书评分推荐，用户评分推荐和图书摘要推荐，探索LLM技术在图书推荐场景中的可行性。同时，本文根据不同的图书推荐任务评估方案和现有的经典推荐模型，讨论了BookGPT在图书推荐场景下的优缺点，并进行了一系列实证比较和分析，证明基于LLM技术的BookGPT框架可以为图书推荐领域带来显著的改进。",
