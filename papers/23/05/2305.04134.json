    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）正在迅速发展，并展示了其执行各种认知任务的能力，包括语言处理、视觉识别和决策。此进展的一部分归因于像GPT（生成式预训练变压器）系列那样的LLM（大型语言模型）。这些模型能够展示出被视为智能的行为。神经心理学中的大多数作者认为，智能行为取决于许多全面技能，或称执行功能（EFs），这些技能依赖于前额叶中神经网络的正确功能，并开发了一系列测试来评估它们。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个问题，即LLM是否正在开发类似于人类的执行功能作为学习的一部分，我们评估了GPT使用流行的汉诺塔方法的规划功能和工作记忆。此外，我们介绍了一种新的古典方法变体来更好地测试规划能力，并发现GPT-2和GPT-3在有限和非人类的方式下展示了一些EFs，如工作记忆和规划。",
