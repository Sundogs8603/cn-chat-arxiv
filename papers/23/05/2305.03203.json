    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了没有货币的多智能体委托搜索的问题，是第一个研究Kleinberg和Kleinberg（EC'18）的多智能体扩展的。在我们的模型中，给定一组智能体，每个智能体采样一定数量的解决方案，并私下发送信号，例如，解决方案的子集，给参与者。然后，根据智能体的信号，参与者选择最终解决方案。我们的模型涵盖了各种现实世界的情景，从经典的经济应用到现代智能系统。与Kleinberg和Kleinberg（EC'18）的单智能体设置形成鲜明对比的是，在我们的模型中，有一些高效的先验独立机制存在信息和绩效增益，并且由于智能体之间的竞争环境，存在某种程度上令人信服的优势。但是，有趣的是，此类竞争环境的强度在很大程度上取决于智能体可获得的信息以及参与者与智能体之间的相关程度。",
