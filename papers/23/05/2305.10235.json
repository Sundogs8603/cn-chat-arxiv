    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的普及对于许多领域产生了重大影响，特别是在其开放式环境（如API、开源模型和插件）中。然而，随着LLMs的广泛部署，缺乏全面讨论和分析潜在风险的研究。因此，我们进行了一项初步但开创性的研究，涵盖了LLMs系统的鲁棒性、一致性和可信性。我们提出了一个自动化工作流程来处理大量查询/响应。总体而言，我们对包括ChatGPT、LLaMA和OPT在内的主流LLMs进行了100多万个查询。我们的工作流核心包括数据原语，随后是自动解释器，评估这些LLMs在不同的对抗性度量系统下的表现。结果，我们得出了几个、也许是不幸的结论，这些结论相当不同",
