    "translated_abstract": "自2010年以来，多次对工业基础设施的网络攻击事件（例如Stuxnet和CrashOverride）一再暴露了工业控制系统（ICS）对网络威胁的脆弱性。工业系统的投入使用时间长，长达几十年，往往导致与工业网络安全机制的技术进展不符。网络基础设施信息的不可用性使得设计安全策略或配置网络入侵检测系统（NIDS）等网络安全对策变得具有挑战性。一个实证的解决方案是从监视的网络流量中自学习工业系统的网络基础设施信息，以使网络对下游分析任务（例如异常检测）透明化。在这项工作中，提出了一种基于Python的PROFINET通信范式感知框架，名为“PROFINET操作枚举和跟踪”（POET），用于枚举可编程逻辑控制器（PLC）执行的不同工业操作，并构建工业通信的知识图。POET被设计为从网络流量中自学习网络基础设施信息，包括PLCs、现场设备和人机界面，并使用知识图来优化异常检测和分类结果。在PROFINET测试平台上进行的实验评估证明了所提出的POET框架在工业网络安全上的高效性和有效性。",
