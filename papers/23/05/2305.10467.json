    "abstract": "Most phenomena related to biomedical tasks are inherently complex, and in many cases, are expressed as signals on biomedical Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In this work, we introduce the use of a new representation framework, the Prime Adjacency Matrix (PAM) for biomedical KGs, which allows for very efficient network analysis. PAM utilizes prime numbers to enable representing the whole KG with a single adjacency matrix and the fast computation of multiple properties of the network. We illustrate the applicability of the framework in the biomedical domain by working on different biomedical knowledge graphs and by providing two case studies: one on drug-repurposing for COVID-19 and one on important metapath extraction. We show that we achieve better results than the original proposed workflows, using very simple methods that require no training, in considerably less time.",

    "translated_abstract": "生物医学任务中的大多数现象本质上是复杂的，并且在许多情况下，它们被表达为生物医学知识图谱（KG）上的信号。我们引入了一种新的表示框架——Prime Adjacency Matrix（PAM）用于生物医学KG，它允许非常高效的网络分析。PAM利用质数来表示整个KG，并快速计算网络的多个属性。我们通过对不同的生物医学知识图谱进行研究并提供两个案例研究：一个是针对COVID-19的药物重复利用，另一个是重要的元路径提取的应用性来说明这个框架的适用性。我们展示了使用非常简单的方法，没有任何的培训，可以在更短的时间内比原始的流程获得更好的结果。",
