    "translated_abstract": "找到一个点的k个最近邻居（kNNS）的问题已经被证明在作为独立应用程序以及更大应用程序的子例程中非常有用。在诸如机器学习和点云等领域中具有广泛的适用性，因此，已经进行了广泛的研究来利用GPU加速来解决此问题。最近的工作表明，与使用着色器核心进行传统加速相比，使用最近GPU中的光线追踪核心加速kNNS要高效得多。但是，将kNNS转换为光线跟踪问题的现有翻译对邻居搜索空间施加了约束。因此，我们只能使用RT核心来加速固定半径的kNNS，这需要用户预先设置搜索半径，因此可能会错过一些邻居。在这项工作中，我们提出了TrueKNN，第一个无限制的RT加速邻居搜索。TrueKNN采用迭代方法，逐步扩大搜索空间，直到所有点找到其k个最近邻居。",
