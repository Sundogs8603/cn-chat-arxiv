We propose that, therefore, (i) graph rewriting subsumes GNNs and could serve as formal model to study and compare them, and (ii) the representation of GNNs as graph rewrite systems can help to design and analyse GNNs, their architectures and algorithms. Hence we propose Graph Rewriting Neural Networks (GReNN) as both novel semantic foundation and engineering discipline for GNNs. We develop a case study reminiscent of a Message Passing Neural Network realised as a Groove graph rewriting model and explore its incremental operation in response to dynamic updates.",

    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）支持对节点、边缘、属性或图属性进行推理。图重写研究基于规则的图形操作，以建模复杂的图形转换。我们认为，（i）图重写包含GNN并可以作为研究和比较它们的正式模型，（ii）将GNN表示为图重写系统可以帮助设计和分析GNN、它们的架构和算法。因此，我们提出Graph Rewriting Neural Networks (GReNN)作为GNN的新语义基础和工程学科。我们开展了一个案例研究，类似于以Groove图形重写模型实现的消息传递神经网络，并探索了它对动态更新的增量操作。",
