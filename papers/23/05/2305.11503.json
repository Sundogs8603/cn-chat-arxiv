    "translated_abstract": "自动摘要在网络文档的爆炸性增长中扮演重要角色。在像CNN.com和WikiHow.com这样的内容网站上，经常存在各种与主要文档一起用于吸引注意力和更易理解的侧面信息，例如视频、图像和查询。这些信息可以用于更好的摘要，因为它们常常明示或暗示文章的本质。然而，大多数现有的侧面感知摘要方法都是设计为集成单模或多模侧面信息 ，并不能有效地互相适应。在本文中，我们提出了一种通用的摘要框架，可以灵活地整合各种模态的侧面信息。设计具有侧面信息的灵活摘要模型的主要挑战包括：（1）侧面信息可以是文本或视觉格式，并且模型需要将其与文档对齐并统一为相同的语义表示。",
