    "translated_abstract": "监督学习中常常受到协变量漂移影响，即训练样本和测试样本的实例边缘分布不同但标签条件相同。现有方法通过使用比率p_te（x）/p_tr（x）对训练样本进行加权（重新加权方法），或者使用比率p_tr（x）/p_te（x）对测试样本进行加权（鲁棒方法）来解决这种协变量漂移。然而，在支持不匹配或上述比率取大值时，这些方法的性能可能很差。我们提出了一种最小极大风险分类(MRC)方法，通过对训练样本和测试样本进行加权来避免这种限制。此外，我们开发了有效的技术来获得两组加权，并推广了传统的核均值匹配方法。我们提供了新的生成模型和实际数据集上的实验结果来证明我们方法的优越性。",
