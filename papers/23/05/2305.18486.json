    "translated_abstract": "最近，如 ChatGPT 这样的大型语言模型（LLM）的开发引起了很多关注。然而，由于难以将该模型生成的产出与基本事实进行比较，因此其在基准学术数据集上的评估仍未充分探索。本文旨在对 ChatGPT 在包括问答、文本摘要、代码生成、常识推理、数学问题求解、机器翻译、偏见检测和伦理考虑等任务中的表现进行彻底评估。具体而言，我们在 140 个任务中评估了 ChatGPT，并分析了其在这些数据集中生成的 255K 次响应，这使我们的工作成为了在 NLP 基准测试中对 ChatGPT 进行的最大评估。简而言之，我们的研究旨在验证 ChatGPT 在各种任务中的优势和弱点，并为使用 LLM 的未来研究提供见解。我们还报告了一种新的迸发能力，即遵循多个查询指令。",
