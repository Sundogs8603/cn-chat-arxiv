    "translated_abstract": "虽然现有的图像异常检测方法取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但它们大多是需要过多预先收集数据的离线学习范式，在需要在线流数据的工业场景中限制其适应性。基于在线学习的图像异常检测方法更适用于工业在线流数据，但鲜为人知。本文首次提出了一种完全在线学习的图像异常检测方法，名为LeMO，即为在线图像异常检测学习记忆，其利用的是学习性记忆，经初始化为正交随机噪声，消除了内存初始化的过度数据需求和离线数据收集的低效性。此外，为了实现在线内存和图像目标导向特征的联合优化，还设计了基于对比学习的异常检测损失函数。所提出的方法简单而高效。大量实验证明了其有效性。",
