    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型（DM）是一种强大的生成模型，最近在包括离线强化学习在内的各种场景中取得了巨大成功，其中策略通过在在线评估中产生轨迹来进行规划学习。然而，尽管单智能体学习显示了其有效性，但仍不清楚DM如何在多智能体问题中操作，其中代理商很难在独立建模每个代理商轨迹的情况下完成团队合作。在本文中，我们提出MADiff，一种新的生成式多智能体学习框架，以解决这个问题。MADiff是通过基于注意力的扩散模型来实现对多个扩散智能体行为的复杂协调建模。据我们所知，MADiff是第一个基于扩散的多智能体离线RL框架，它既可以行为为分散的政策，又可以为集中控制器，其中包括对手建模，并可用于多智能体轨迹预测。",
