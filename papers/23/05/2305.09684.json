    "translated_abstract": "基于云服务器的服务需求，基础模型通常部署在云服务器上。然而，这也将模型暴露在安全风险中，攻击者可以在上传或传输到云服务器后修改它们。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种迭代的、基于决策的脆弱性水印算法，将普通训练样本转化为对模型更敏感的脆弱样本。在验证过程中，我们将原始模型的敏感样本输出与被攻击模型的输出进行比较，以评估模型的完整性。所提出的脆弱水印算法是一个优化问题，旨在最小化将转换样本输入到目标模型时预测概率分布的方差。我们通过多次迭代将普通样本转换为脆弱样本。我们的方法具有一些优点：（1）决策黑匣子方式下的迭代更新样本；（2）算法应用在模型完整性验证领域，而非加密领域。",
