    "translated_abstract": "基于距离的监督方法——最小学习机，通过学习输入和输出距离矩阵之间的映射，从数据中构建预测模型。本文提出了一种方法并评估了这种技术及其核心组件——距离映射如何适应多标签学习。所提出的方法基于将距离映射与逆距离加权相结合。虽然这种方法是多标签学习文献中最简单的方法之一，但它在小到中等规模的多标签学习问题上实现了最先进的性能。除了它的简单性，所提出的方法是完全确定性的，并且可以通过基于排名损失统计量的方法选择其超参数，这种方法具有封闭形式，因此避免了传统的基于交叉验证的超参数调整方法。此外，由于其简单的线性距离映射构造方式，我们展示了所提出的方法可以评估预测的不确定性。",
