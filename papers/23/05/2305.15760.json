    "abstract": "India is the second largest English-speaking country in the world with a speaker base of roughly 130 million. Thus, it is imperative that automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for English should be evaluated on Indian accents. Unfortunately, Indian speakers find a very poor representation in existing English ASR benchmarks such as LibriSpeech, Switchboard, Speech Accent Archive, etc. In this work, we address this gap by creating Svarah, a benchmark that contains 9.6 hours of transcribed English audio from 117 speakers across 65 geographic locations throughout India, resulting in a diverse range of accents. Svarah comprises both read speech and spontaneous conversational data, covering various domains, such as history, culture, tourism, etc., ensuring a diverse vocabulary. We evaluate 6 open source ASR models and 2 commercial ASR systems on Svarah and show that there is clear scope for improvement on Indian accents. Svarah as well as all our code will be publicly available.",

    "translated_abstract": "印度是世界上第二大讲英语的国家，其使用者约有1.3亿人。因此，对于英语的自动语音识别(ASR)系统来说，对印度口音的评估是至关重要的。然而，印度说话者在现有的英语ASR基准测试中，如LibriSpeech、Switchboard、Speech Accent Archive等，得到的代表性非常差。在这项工作中，我们通过创建Svarah来解决这一缺口，该基准测试包含来自印度65个地理位置上的117个说话者的9.6小时的英语音频转录，具有各种口音和领域的阅读和会话数据，如历史、文化、旅游等，确保了词汇的多样性。我们在Svarah上评估了6个开放源代码ASR模型和2个商业ASR系统，并表明印度口音上存在改进的明显空间。Svarah和我们的所有代码都将公开提供。",
