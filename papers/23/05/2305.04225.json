    "translated_abstract": "异质性被认为是伤害图神经网络（GNN）性能的问题。为了解决这个问题，一些现有的工作使用多跳邻居信息的图级加权融合来包含更多具有同质性的节点。然而，异质性可能在节点之间不同，需要考虑局部拓扑。在此基础上，本文提出使用局部相似性（LocalSim）学习节点级加权融合，并可作为即插即用模块。为了更好地融合，我们提出了一种新的、高效的初始残差差连接（IRDC）来提取更具信息性的多跳信息。此外，我们对合成图上LocalSim代表节点同质性的有效性进行了理论分析。在真实基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，我们提出的方法，即局部相似性图神经网络（LSGNN），在同质性和异质性图上均能提供可比或优于最先进的性能。",
