    "translated_abstract": "尽管线性系统的稳定性已经被充分了解，但对于具有非线性动力学的系统仍然是一个主要的挑战。在这种情况下的一般方法是利用李雅普诺夫稳定性理论来计算李雅普诺夫控制函数和相关控制策略的组合。然而，对于一般的非线性系统寻找李雅普诺夫函数是一个具有挑战性的任务。为了解决这个挑战，最近提出了几种使用神经网络表示李雅普诺夫函数的方法。然而，这些方法仅针对连续时间系统设计。我们提出了第一种适用于离散时间系统学习神经李雅普诺夫控制的方法。三个关键要素使我们能够有效地学习可证明稳定的控制策略。第一个是通过混合整数线性规划来验证离散时间系统中的稳定性条件，这是一种新的方法。第二个是计算子水平集的一种新方法，该方法刻画了吸引域的区域",
