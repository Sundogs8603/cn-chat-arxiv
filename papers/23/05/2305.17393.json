    "translated_abstract": "口语问答是语音助手的一个重要功能，通常由多个问答系统支持。用户通过自然语音询问问题，可能包含不流畅、错误和非正式的语法或措辞。这是问答系统的一个主要挑战，导致未回答的问题或无关的答案，并导致用户体验差。我们分析了未成功回答的问答请求，以确定核心挑战：词汇差距、命题类型、复杂的句法结构和高特异性。我们提出了一个语义问答重构模型 (SURF)，提供三个基于语言学的操作 (修复、句法重塑、概括) 来重写问题以便于回答。离线评估来自领先语音助手的 100 万个未回答的问题，结果显示 SURF 显著提高了回答率：高达 24% 的问题获得了相关答案 (75%)。实时部署显示出对数百万有未回答的问题的客户产生了积极的影响。",
