    "abstract": "In a sequential regression setting, a decision-maker may be primarily concerned with whether the future observation will increase or decrease compared to the current one, rather than the actual value of the future observation. In this context, we introduce the notion of parity calibration, which captures the goal of calibrated forecasting for the increase-decrease (or \"parity\") event in a timeseries. Parity probabilities can be extracted from a forecasted distribution for the output, but we show that such a strategy leads to theoretical unpredictability and poor practical performance. We then observe that although the original task was regression, parity calibration can be expressed as binary calibration. Drawing on this connection, we use an online binary calibration method to achieve parity calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world case studies in epidemiology, weather forecasting, and model-based control in nuclear fusion.",

    "translated_abstract": "在序列回归设置中，决策者可能更关注未来观测值是否比当前值增加或减少，而不是未来观测值的实际值。在此背景下，我们引入了平等校准的概念，它捕捉了时间序列增减事件的校准预测目标。平等概率可以从输出的预测分布中提取，但我们显示这种策略导致理论上的不可预测性和差劲的实际性能。然后我们发现，虽然原任务是回归，但平等校准可以被表达为二进制校准。基于这种联系，我们使用在线二进制校准方法实现了平等校准。我们通过流行病学、天气预报和基于模型的核聚变控制的实际案例展示了我们方法的有效性。",
