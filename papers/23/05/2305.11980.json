    "translated_abstract": "Coreset是一个与输入集合紧密相似于某种特定查询的损失函数的加权子集。由于Coreset对许多应用程序具有优势，并已被广泛用于机器学习，因此Coreset成为了普遍的研究领域。然而，当前Coreset的构建往往是问题依赖的，即对于每个问题，通常都会建议使用一种新的Coreset构建算法，这一过程可能需要时间，或者对于该领域的新研究人员来说可能很难。即使是通用框架，用户也需要完成其他（问题相关的）计算或证明。此外，许多问题并没有（可证明的）小的Coreset，限制了其应用性。为此，我们提出了一个自动实用的框架来构建Coreset，它只需要用户输入数据和期望的成本函数，无需用户完成任何其他任务相关的计算。为此，我们将将大数据集转换为小Coreset简化为一个简单的优化问题，并由我们提出的框架自动解决。我们的框架是通用的，适用于任何数据和成本函数，并且也是实用的，因为它能快速构建Coreset，同时保证高质量的逼近。",
