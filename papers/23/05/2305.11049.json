    "translated_abstract": "受传统偏微分方程方法的启发，我们提出了一种新颖的神经网络体系框架 NODE-ImgNet，将神经常微分方程（NODEs）与卷积神经网络（CNN）块相结合。 NODE-ImgNet 是本质上的 PDE 模型，动态系统是隐式学习的，而不是显式指定 PDE，自然地避免了学习过程中引入伪像的典型问题。通过调用这种 NODE 结构，可以将其视为残差网络（ResNet）的连续变体，继承其在图像去噪中的优点，我们的模型实现了增强的准确性和参数效率。特别是，在不同场景下，包括受高斯噪声干扰的灰度和彩色图像去噪，以及真实噪声图像学习方面，我们的模型展示了一致的有效性，并展示了从小图像数据集中学习的优势。",
