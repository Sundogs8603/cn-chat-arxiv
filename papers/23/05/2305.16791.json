    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了使用神经控制微分方程（Kidger，Morrill等，2020）从不规则采样的时间序列样本中预测结果的监督学习设置。在我们的框架中，时间序列是一个未观察到的连续路径的离散化，结果通过一个具有未知向量场的控制微分方程依赖于这个路径。使用离散数据进行学习会引入离散偏差，我们精确地量化了这种偏差。通过使用关于控制微分方程流的连续性的理论结果，我们展示了逼近偏差直接与由浅层神经网络定义生成模型的利普希茨函数的逼近误差相关。通过结合最近的工作将神经网络的利普希茨常数与其泛化能力联系起来，我们上界了经验风险最小化器达到的期望损失与贝叶斯最优风险之间的泛化差距。",
