    "translated_abstract": "为了解决与隐私和气候变化有关的愈发增长的社会关切，欧盟颁布了《通用数据保护条例》(GDPR)并承诺了绿色协议。大量研究探究了运用匿名数据集训练机器学习模型的能效和准确性。最近的研究开始探究隐私增强技术（PET）对机器学习模型的能量消耗和准确性的影响，重点关注k-匿名。由于合成数据越来越受欢迎，因此本文分析了两个阶段的能量消耗和准确性：a）将隐私增强技术应用于相关数据集，b）在相关隐私增强数据集上训练模型。我们使用两种隐私增强技术：k-匿名化（使用泛化和抑制）和合成数据，以及三种机器学习模型。每个模型都在每个隐私增强数据集上进行训练。结果显示，在经过k-匿名化的数据上训练的模型具有较低的准确性，并且消耗的能量较少，与在非匿名化数据上训练的模型相比。然而，k-匿名化过程中消耗的能量非常可观，在评估其有用性时必须将其考虑在内。合成数据证明是一种有前途的选择，因为它在消耗更少能源的情况下实现了与非匿名化数据可比的准确性。",
