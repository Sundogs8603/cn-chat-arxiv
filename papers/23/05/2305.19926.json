    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在人工智能领域取得了显著进展，大大重塑了人机交互。我们不仅关注LLMs的性能，还从心理学角度探索它们的特点，认识到了理解它们行为特征的重要性。本研究采用心理学的一个框架——特质理论研究LLMs所展示的行为模式。我们首先关注评估ChatGPT所展示的人格类型的一致性。此外，实验涉及七种附加语言的跨语言影响，以及六种其他LLMs的研究。此外，该研究还调查了ChatGPT是否能够展示对指令或情境线索的人格变化。研究结果表明，无论指令或情境如何，ChatGPT始终保持其ENFJ人格。通过揭示LLMs的个性化，我们预计我们的解决方案可以促进人与机器之间更好的沟通和协作。",
