Directly adopting existing hypergraph methods on clinical notes cannot sufficiently utilize the hierarchy information of the patient, which can degrade clinical semantic information by (1) frequent neutral words and (2) hierarchies with imbalanced distribution.

    "translated_abstract": "利用电子健康记录（EHR）中的知识来预测患者的病情对于提供适当的护理至关重要。患者的临床笔记包含医疗保健专业人员的有价值的信息，但由于其难以理解的内容和复杂的层次结构而被低估。最近，基于超图的方法已被提出用于文档分类。直接采用现有的超图方法处理患者的临床笔记无法充分利用患者的层次信息，这可能会通过(1) 频繁使用的中性词和(2) 分布不平衡的层次结构降低临床语义信息。因此，我们提出了一个基于分类级别的多层超图神经网络（TM-HGNN），其中多层超图通过笔记和分类级别的超边组装有用的中性词和稀有关键词，以保留临床语义信息。构建的患者超图输入分层消息传递层，其中消息传递在同一级别内受到限制，并由超边连接指导。在MIMIC-III数据集上的实验结果表明，我们提出的TM-HGNN在患者级别分类任务中优于现有最先进的方法。",
