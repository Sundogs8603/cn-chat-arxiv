    "abstract": "Active investing aims to construct a portfolio of assets that are believed to be relatively profitable in the markets, with one popular method being to construct a portfolio via factor-based strategies. In recent years, there have been increasing efforts to apply deep learning to pursue \"deep factors'' with more active returns or promising pipelines for asset trends prediction. However, the question of how to construct an active investment portfolio via an end-to-end deep learning framework (E2E) is still open and rarely addressed in existing works. In this paper, we are the first to propose an E2E that covers almost the entire process of factor investing through factor selection, factor combination, stock selection, and portfolio construction. Extensive experiments on real stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our end-to-end deep leaning framework in active investing.",

    "translated_abstract": "主动投资旨在构建一组在市场上被认为相对有利可图的投资组合，其中一种流行的方法是通过基于因子的策略来构建投资组合。近年来，越来越多的努力将深度学习应用于追求具有更高主动回报或有前途的资产趋势预测流水线的“深度因子”。然而，如何通过端到端深度学习框架（E2E）构建主动投资组合的问题仍然是开放的，在现有文献中很少得到解决。在本文中，我们首次提出了一个 E2E，几乎涵盖了因子选择、因子组合、股票选择和投资组合构建的整个过程。对真实股票市场数据的广泛实验表明，我们的端到端深度学习框架在主动投资中的有效性。",
