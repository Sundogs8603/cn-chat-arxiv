    "translated_abstract": "随着自动化机器学习（AutoML）领域的发展，将领域知识纳入这些系统中变得越来越重要。我们利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的强大功能提出了一种方法来实现这一目标。具体地，我们介绍了一种用于表格数据的特征工程方法，名为上下文感知自动特征工程（CAAFE），它利用LLM根据数据集的描述生成更多具有语义意义的特征。该方法产生用于创建新特征的Python代码，并提供生成特征的效用说明。尽管方法论上很简单，但CAAFE提高了14个数据集中11个数据集的性能，与2个数据集并列，只有1个数据集性能下降，从而使所有数据集的平均ROC AUC表现从0.798提升至0.822。对于所评估的数据集，这一改进与使用随机森林（AUC 0.782）代替逻辑回归（AUC 0.754）所获得的平均改进相似。此外，",
