    "translated_abstract": "抑郁症是最常见和严重的精神疾病，引发了严重的经济和社会影响。抑郁症的检测对于早期干预以减轻这些后果至关重要。这种高风险的决策本质上需要可解释性。虽然有一些抑郁症检测研究试图基于重要性分数或关注权重解释决策，但这些解释与临床抑郁症诊断标准不一致，后者基于抑郁症状。为了填补这一空白，我们遵循计算设计科学范式，开发了一种新颖的多尺度时间原型网络(MSTPNet)。MSTPNet创新地检测和解释抑郁症状及其持续时间。使用大规模数据集进行深入实证分析表明，MSTPNet在F1分数0.851上优于最先进的抑郁症检测方法。这个结果还揭示了未在调查方法中注意到的新症状，例如分享。",
