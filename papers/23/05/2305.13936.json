    "translated_abstract": "在许多多智能体场景中，智能体之间的消息共享促进协调，加快多智能体通信的鲁棒性，尤其是在消息受扰动的环境中部署策略时。然而，目前许多相关工作都基于特定假设，如有限的消息通道可以承受扰动，从而限制了其在复杂场景中的有效性。本文提出了一个名为 CroMAC 的算法，通过多视图消息认证来学习鲁棒的多智能体通信策略。在 CroMAC 下训练的智能体可以获得状态动作值的保证下限，以在接收到受扰动消息时识别并选择最优决策。具体来说，本文首先将多智能体通信建模为一个多视图问题，其中每个消息代表一个状态视图。然后我们使用多视图变分自编码器（MVAE）提取经过认证的联合消息表示。",
