    "translated_abstract": "磁共振成像（MRI）在低场强下具有降低的信噪比（SNR），在从高场强MRI图像生成低场强MRI图像时，信号会受到破坏，因此重建低场强像高场强的图像是一个复杂的问题。此外，获取成对的低场强和高场强MR图像通常是不现实的。我们理论上发现，这些挑战的组合使得直接学习从低场强MR图像到高场强MR图像的映射的常规深度学习方法不适用。为了克服这些挑战，我们引入了一种新颖的元学习方法，采用了教师 - 学生机制。首先，一个基于最优传输的教师从高场强到低场强MR图像中学习降级过程，并生成伪成对的高场强和低场强MRI图像。然后，一个基于分数的学生解决重建高场强图像的逆问题，最终生成1.5T-like的图像。",
