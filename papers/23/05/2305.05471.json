    "translated_abstract": "随着自然语言处理(NLP)的最新进展，越来越多的应用程序出现在各种用例中。在众多的NLP应用中，许多学术研究人员受到激励，希望通过工作具有积极的社会影响，符合NLP for Social Good (NLP4SG)的最新倡议。然而，研究人员并不总是清楚地了解自己的研究工作如何解决当今的重大社会问题。因此，在本文中，我们介绍NLP4SGPAPERS，这是一个具有三个相关任务的科学数据集，可以帮助识别NLP4SG论文，并通过以下几个方面对NLP4SG进行描述: (1)确定解决社会问题的论文，(2)将它们映射到相应的联合国可持续发展目标(SDGs)，以及(3)识别它们正在解决的任务和使用的方法。我们使用最先进的NLP模型，解决了每个任务，并将它们用于整个ACL文集，从而产生一个可视化工作区，为研究人员提供了对NLP4SG领域的鸟瞰图。",
