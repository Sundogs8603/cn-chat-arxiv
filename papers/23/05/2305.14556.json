    "abstract": "Large pre-trained language models have exhibited unprecedented capabilities in producing high-quality text via prompting techniques. This fact introduces new possibilities for data collection and annotation, particularly in situations where such data is scarce, complex to gather, expensive, or even sensitive. In this paper, we explore the potential of these models to generate and annotate goal-oriented dialogues, and conduct an in-depth analysis to evaluate their quality. Our experiments employ ChatGPT, and encompass three categories of goal-oriented dialogues (task-oriented, collaborative, and explanatory), two generation modes (interactive and one-shot), and two languages (English and Italian). Based on extensive human-based evaluations, we demonstrate that the quality of generated dialogues and annotations is on par with those generated by humans.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型预训练语言模型以提示技术为手段产生高质量文本的能力前所未有。这一事实为数据收集和注释带来了新的可能性，特别是在这种数据稀缺、难以收集、昂贵甚至敏感的情况下。在本文中，我们探索了这些模型生成和注释面向目标的对话的潜力，并进行了深入的分析以评估它们的质量。我们的实验采用ChatGPT，并包括三类面向目标的对话（任务导向、协作和说明性）、两种生成模式（交互式和一次性）和两种语言（英语和意大利语）。基于广泛的人工评估，我们证明了生成的对话和注释的质量与人类生成的相当。",
