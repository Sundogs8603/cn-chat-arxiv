    "translated_abstract": "虽然已经确认流行度偏见在推荐（和其他基于排名的）系统中发挥作用，但其对用户福利的影响的详细分析仍然缺乏。我们提出了一种通用机制，通过它，物品的流行度、质量和位置偏差可以影响用户选择，并且可以负面影响各种推荐策略的集体用户效用。我们将问题表述为非平稳上下文脱靶机，强调不是为了消除流行度偏见而是为了减轻其负面影响而进行探索的重要性。首先，普通的有流行度偏差的推荐系统会通过混淆物品质量和流行度而引发线性遗憾。更一般地，我们展示了即使在线性设置下，由于流行度偏见的混淆效应，物品质量的可识别性也可能无法实现。然而，在足够变异的假设下，我们开发了一种高效的类UCB算法，并证明了有效的遗憾保证。我们通过实验验证了我们提出的算法的有效性，并证实了流行度偏见的负面影响。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the impact of popularity bias on user welfare in recommender systems and proposes an algorithm to mitigate its negative effects by exploring. The results show that popularity bias can negatively impact the collective user utility of various recommender policies and even the identifiability of item quality may not be possible. The proposed algorithm is effective in real-world experiments."
