    "abstract": "This paper presents a new AI challenge, the Tales of Tribute AI Competition (TOTAIC), based on a two-player deck-building card game released with the High Isle chapter of The Elder Scrolls Online. Currently, there is no other AI competition covering Collectible Card Games (CCG) genre, and there has never been one that targets a deck-building game. Thus, apart from usual CCG-related obstacles to overcome, like randomness, hidden information, and large branching factor, the successful approach additionally requires long-term planning and versatility. The game can be tackled with multiple approaches, including classic adversarial search, single-player planning, and Neural Networks-based algorithms. This paper introduces the competition framework, describes the rules of the game, and presents the results of a tournament between sample AI agents. The first edition of TOTAIC is hosted at the IEEE Conference on Games 2023.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一项新的人工智能挑战，即致敬神话人工智能竞赛(TOTAIC)，该竞赛基于《上古卷轴在线》海之岛章节发布的一款双人卡牌建设类游戏。目前还没有其他涵盖收集卡牌游戏(CCG)类型的人工智能竞赛，也从未有过针对建设卡牌游戏的竞赛。因此，成功的方法除了要克服通常与CCG相关的障碍，如随机性、隐藏信息和大的分支因素外，还需要长期规划和适应性。该游戏可以采用多种方法进行解决，包括经典的对抗搜索、单人计划和基于神经网络的算法。本文介绍了竞赛框架，描述了游戏规则，并呈现了示例AI代理之间的锦标赛结果。TOTAIC的第一届将在2023年IEEE游戏会议上举行。",
