    "translated_abstract": "海表温度 (SST) 预测有助于管理受人类气候变化影响的海洋生态系统和水产养殖。数值动力模型对于 SST 预测具有资源密集型；机器学习 (ML) 模型可以减少高计算要求，并且最近一直是研究界关注的焦点。ML 模型通常需要大量数据进行训练。环境数据是在定期间隔的网格上收集的，因此早期的工作主要使用基于网格的深度学习 (DL) 进行预测。然而，网格数据和相应的 DL 方法都存在固有问题。随着几何深度学习的出现，将图形作为更广义的数据结构和图形神经网络 (GNNs) 引入到时空域中。在这项工作中，我们初步探讨了图形重新采样和 GNN 用于全球 SST 预测，而 GNN 在大多数海洋中相对于持久性模型在 RMSE 和 MAE 方面显示出更好的提前一个月的 SST 预测结果。",
