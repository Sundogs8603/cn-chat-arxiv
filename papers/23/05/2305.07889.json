    "translated_abstract": "将深度学习与结构工程相结合已经受到了广泛关注，用于前向问题（结构模拟）和反向问题（结构健康监测）。本研究基于傅里叶神经运算器，提出了VINO（车辆-桥梁相互作用神经运算器），作为桥梁结构的数字孪生。VINO学习结构响应场和损伤场之间的映射。本研究通过运行参数有限元（FE）模拟，考虑结构初始损伤场的随机分布，建立了VBI-FE数据集。随后，在四种损伤情况下进行了实验研究，产生了VBI-EXP数据集。在VINO通过VBI-FE预训练并在健康状态下通过VBI-EXP微调后，模型实现了以下两个改进。首先，前向的VINO比FE模型更准确地从损伤场输入预测结构响应。其次，反向的VINO可以确定损伤区域和程度。",
