    "translated_abstract": "模糊时间序列预测（FTSF）是一种具有广泛应用的典型预测方法。传统的FTSF被认为是一种专家系统，导致失去了识别未定义特征的能力，这是FTSF预测不准确的主要原因。为了解决这个问题，提出了差分模糊卷积神经网络（DFCNN）模型，利用卷积神经网络实现具有可学习能力的FTSF。DFCNN能够识别潜在信息并改善预测精度。由于神经网络的可学习能力，FTSF建立的模糊规则的长度可以任意扩展，这是专家系统所无法处理的。同时，由于非平稳时间序列的趋势，FTSF通常无法实现令人满意的性能。非平稳时间序列的趋势会导致FTSF建立的模糊集失效，并导致预测失败。DFCNN利用卷积神经网络的学习能力，可以处理非平稳时间序列。",
