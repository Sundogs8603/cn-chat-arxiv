    "translated_abstract": "在具有时间至事件结果的经验研究中，研究人员常常利用观察数据，在随机对照试验数据不适用的情况下进行曝光的因果推断。模型错配和缺乏重叠是观察研究中常见的问题，它们经常导致平均治疗效应的不一致和低效的估计器。为解决覆盖度不足的挑战，已经提出了针对叠加加权效应的估计器，而使辅助模型能够进行灵活的机器学习的方法可以解决模型错配的问题。但是，当存在覆盖度不足时，允许辅助模型进行机器学习的方法尚未扩展到时间至事件结果的加权平均治疗效应的情景中。在本文中，我们提出了一类一步交叉适应的双重/去偏机器学习估计器，用于作为限制时间的加权累积因果效应的函数。我们证明了拟议方法的一致性和渐近正常性。",
