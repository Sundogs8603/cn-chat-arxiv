    "abstract": "We introduce ECHo, a diagnostic dataset of event causality inference grounded in visual-and-linguistic social scenarios. ECHo employs real-world human-centric deductive information collected from crime drama, bridging the gap in multimodal reasoning towards higher social intelligence through the elicitation of intermediate Theory-of-Mind (ToM). We propose a unified framework aligned with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm to assess the reasoning capability of current AI systems. This ToM-enhanced CoT pipeline can accommodate and integrate various large foundation models in zero-shot visual-and-linguistic understanding. With this framework, we scrutinize the advanced large language and multimodal models via three complementary human-centric ECHo tasks. Further analysis demonstrates ECHo as a challenging dataset to expose imperfections and inconsistencies in reasoning.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了 ECHo，这是一个基于视觉和语言社交情境的事件因果推断诊断数据集。 ECHo利用从犯罪剧中收集的真实人类中心演绎信息，通过激发中间心灵理论（ToM）来弥合多模态推理的鸿沟，从而提高社交智能。我们提出了一个与Chain-of-Thought（CoT）范式对齐的统一框架，以评估当前AI系统的推理能力。这个ToM增强的CoT管道可以在 零-shot视觉和语言理解中包容和整合各种大型基础模型。利用这个框架，我们通过三个互补的基于人类中心的ECHo任务来审查先进的大型语言和多模态模型。进一步的分析表明，ECHo是一个具有挑战性的数据集，可以暴露推理中的不完善和不一致性。",
