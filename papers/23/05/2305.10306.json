    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的通用信息抽取范式，它与任何模式格式兼容，并适用于一系列信息抽取任务，如命名实体识别、关系抽取、事件提取和情感分析。我们的方法将以文本为基础的信息抽取任务转化为 token-pair 问题，使用一种统一的提取框架 UniEX，将所有提取目标都统一分解为联合跨度检测、分类和关联问题。UniEX 可以同时编码基于模式的提示和文本信息，并使用自动编码器语言模型协同学习预定义信息的广义知识。我们开发了 traffine 注意机制，将包括任务、标签和内部 token 在内的异构因素集成起来，并通过评分矩阵获得提取目标。实验结果表明，UniEX 在 $14$个基准测试数据集上的表现和推理速度都优于基于生成的通用信息抽取模型。",
