    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的方法来理解深度学习中损失曲率与泛化之间的关系。具体来说，我们利用现有的深度网络损失黑塞矩阵频谱经验分析，提出了一个将损失黑塞矩阵和深度神经网络的输入-输出雅克比矩阵联系起来的假设。然后，我们证明了一系列理论结果，量化了模型的输入-输出雅克比矩阵近似其在数据分布上的利普西茨范数的程度，并推导出了一个基于经验雅克比矩阵的新的泛化界。我们利用我们的假设和理论结果，给出了关于最近观察到的进化磨锋现象以及平坦极小的泛化性质的新描述。实验证据验证了我们的主张。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new hypothesis linking the loss Hessian and the input-output Jacobian of a deep neural network, and quantifies the degree to which the input-output Jacobian of a model approximates its Lipschitz norm over a data distribution through a series of theoretical results. A novel generalisation bound based on the empirical Jacobian is derived. The paper provides a new account of the recently observed progressive sharpening phenomenon and the generalisation properties of flat minima, which is validated through experiments."
