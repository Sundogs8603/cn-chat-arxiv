    "translated_abstract": "逆问题，即从实验数据中估计物理模型的参数，在科学和工程中普遍存在。贝叶斯公式是黄金标准，因为它可以缓解病态性问题并量化认识不确定性。然而，由于解析后验不通常可用，人们采用马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗采样或近似变分推理。但是，需要重新从头开始进行推理以适应每组新数据。这种缺点限制了贝叶斯公式在实时设置，例如工程系统的健康监测和医疗诊断中的适用性。本文的目标是开发一种方法，通过学习从数据到后验的贝叶斯逆映射，即从数据到后验的映射，实现实时推理的方法。我们的方法如下。我们使用基于深度神经网络的参数化表示后验分布。接下来，我们通过摊销变分推理学习网络参数，其中训练神经网络以预测从数据中预测后验分布，从而实现快速准确的推理。我们在流体力学中的一些逆问题上展示了我们方法的有效性，其中包括参数估计和流场重构。",
