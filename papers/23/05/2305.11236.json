    "abstract": "The majority of work in privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) has been focusing on horizontally partitioned datasets where clients share the same sets of features and can train complete models independently. However, in many interesting problems, such as financial fraud detection and disease detection, individual data points are scattered across different clients/organizations in vertical federated learning. Solutions for this type of FL require the exchange of gradients between participants and rarely consider privacy and security concerns, posing a potential risk of privacy leakage. In this work, we present a novel design for training vertical FL securely and efficiently using state-of-the-art security modules for secure aggregation. We demonstrate empirically that our method does not impact training performance whilst obtaining 9.1e2 ~3.8e4 speedup compared to homomorphic encryption (HE).",

    "translated_abstract": "隐私保护联邦学习（FL）的大部分工作都集中在水平分区数据集上，其中客户共享相同的特征集并可以独立地训练完整的模型。然而，在许多有趣的问题中，例如金融欺诈和疾病检测，个别数据点散落在竖直联邦学习的不同客户/组织中。针对这种FL的解决方案需要参与者之间的梯度交换，很少考虑隐私和安全问题，可能存在隐私泄露的风险。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新颖的设计，使用最先进的安全模块进行安全聚合，以安全有效地进行竖向FL训练。我们通过实验证明，与同态加密(HE)相比，我们的方法在不影响训练性能的情况下，获得了9.1e2~3.8e4的加速比。",
