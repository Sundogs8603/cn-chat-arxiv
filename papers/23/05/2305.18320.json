    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型正在逐渐融入我们的生活。因此，了解它们输出中的偏见是很重要的，以避免持续流传有害的刻板印象。这种挑战需要开发新的基准和方法来量化情感和语义偏差，同时铭记LLMs是反映社会中普遍存在的观点和倾向的心理社会镜子。其中一种有害的负面影响是青少年全球普遍存在的数学和STEM领域的焦虑现象。在本文中，我们运用网络科学和认知心理学的方法，使用行为forma mentis网络(BFMNs)，研究了先进的LLMs，即GPT-3、Chat-GPT和GPT-4，提供的数学和STEM领域的知识，以及这些LLMs如何将数学和STEM领域与其他概念联系起来。我们使用与数学和STEM相关的提示探测神经语言模型的吞吐量获取的数据，发现GPT-3、Chat-GPT和GPT-4都倾向于将数学和STEM领域视为困难、紧张和引起焦虑，反映了高中学生数学焦虑现象。我们的结果强调了考虑LLMs中存在的偏见的重要性，并突显了利用网络科学和认知心理学开发量化这些偏见的新工具的潜力。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study reveals the biases in advanced language models (GPT-3, Chat-GPT, and GPT-4) towards math and STEM fields, indicating that they tend to view math and STEM topics as difficult, stressful, and anxiety-provoking, mirroring the phenomenon of math anxiety observed in high-school students. The researchers used behavioral forma mentis networks (BFMNs) to quantify these biases and highlight the potential role of network science and cognitive psychology in developing tools for understanding and addressing bias in language models."
