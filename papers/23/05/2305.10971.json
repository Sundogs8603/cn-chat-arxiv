    "abstract": "Africa has over 2000 indigenous languages but they are under-represented in NLP research due to lack of datasets. In recent years, there have been progress in developing labeled corpora for African languages. However, they are often available in a single domain and may not generalize to other domains. In this paper, we focus on the task of sentiment classification for cross domain adaptation. We create a new dataset, NollySenti - based on the Nollywood movie reviews for five languages widely spoken in Nigeria (English, Hausa, Igbo, Nigerian-Pidgin, and Yoruba. We provide an extensive empirical evaluation using classical machine learning methods and pre-trained language models. Leveraging transfer learning, we compare the performance of cross-domain adaptation from Twitter domain, and cross-lingual adaptation from English language. Our evaluation shows that transfer from English in the same target domain leads to more than 5% improvement in accuracy compared to transfer from Twitter in ",

    "translated_abstract": "非洲有超过2000种本土语言，但由于缺乏数据集，它们在自然语言处理研究中的代表性不高。最近几年，已经开始开发非洲语言的标注语料库，但这些语料库通常只在单一领域中可用，可能无法推广到其他领域。本文针对不同领域适应的情感分类任务，创建了一个新的数据集——NollySenti，它基于尼日利亚五种常用语言（英语、豪萨语、伊博语、尼日利亚皮钦语和约鲁巴语）的诺利木电影评论。我们使用传统的机器学习方法和预训练的语言模型进行了全面的经验评估。利用迁移学习，我们将来自Twitter领域的跨域适应和来自英语语言的跨语言适应的性能进行了比较。我们的评估结果表明，从具有相同目标域的英语进行迁移比从Twitter进行迁移可以提高5％以上的准确性。",
