    "translated_abstract": "应用程序安全是现代软件开发的重要组成部分，许多攻击取决于软件中的漏洞。由于技术进步，攻击数量正在全球范围内增加。公司必须在开发、测试和部署软件的每个阶段中都包含安全功能，以防止数据泄露。检测软件漏洞的方法有许多种，如非AI方法(如SAST和DAST)。然而，这些方法存在大量的误报和漏报。与此相对，研究人员一直致力于开发基于AI的漏洞检测系统，采用了BERT、BLSTM等深度学习模型。在本文中，我们提出了一种双阶段解决方案，提出了两个深度学习模型，用于C/C++源代码的漏洞检测。第一阶段是CNN，用于检测源代码是否包含任何漏洞(二元分类)，第二阶段是基于LSTM的模型，用于识别特定类型的漏洞(多类分类)。所提出的解决方案在检测和分类各种类型的漏洞方面实现了高精度率，优于传统的SAST和DAST方法。",
