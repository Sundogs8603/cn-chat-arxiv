    "translated_abstract": "水下声学目标识别是一项棘手的任务，由于复杂的声源特征和声波传播模式而变得十分困难。基于深度学习的识别模型，受限于数据量不足和狭窄信息视角，在实际水下场景中似乎远未达到满意程度。尽管水下声学信号受距离、水深或其他因素的严重影响，但相关信息的注释往往是不均匀的、不完整的、难以使用的。本文提出了一种基于文本模板的水下声学目标识别方法（UART），通过将来自不同视角的相关信息整合成自然语言来设计模板。UART采用音频-频谱图-文本三模态对比学习框架，赋予UART用自然语言指导声学表示学习的能力。实验结果表明，UART可以显著提高各种水下声学数据集上识别模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。",

By adopting an audio-spectrogram-text tri-modal contrastive learning framework, UART can guide the learning of acoustic representations through natural language and significantly enhance the interpretability and robustness of recognition models on various underwater acoustic datasets."
