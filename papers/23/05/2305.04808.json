    "translated_abstract": "常识推理旨在为机器赋予类似于人的情景推断能力，这极其具有挑战性。 对于一个几乎不了解“冥想”但熟悉“唱歌”的人，他仍然可以从现有的知识中通过将“唱歌”概念化为“一种放松的事件”，然后将该事件实例化为“冥想”，推断出“冥想使人放松”。 这个过程称为概念归纳和演绎，在缺乏标记数据和提高常识建模方法的情况下变得更加根本。为填补这样的研究空白，我们提出了CAT（情景化概念化和实例化），这是一个将事件概念化和实例化融合起来，以大规模概念化常识知识库的半监督学习框架。广泛的实验证明，我们的框架在两个概念推理基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，证明了我们提出的方法的有效性。",
