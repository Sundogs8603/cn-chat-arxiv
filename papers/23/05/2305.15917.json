    "translated_abstract": "时间的部分有序模型在应用中自然而然地出现，这些应用中代理或进程不能完美地彼此通信，可以追溯到Lamport的开创性工作。本文研究了判断是否一个（可能不完整的）事件系统的描述是一致的问题，即部分有序时间（POT）点代数的网络一致性问题。虽然这个问题的经典复杂性已经完全解决，但是关于POT的细粒度复杂性的了解相对较少，除了可以通过枚举有序分区以$O^*((0.368n)^n)$时间解决。我们构造了一种更快的算法，其运行时间仅为$O^*((0.26n)^n)$。这是通过对类似于全序的结构进行精细枚举，然后向解决方案贪婪地扩展来实现的。虽然早期的类似想法已经在相关问题中探索过，但实际上POT的分析是非平凡的，需要重大的新成果。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a fast algorithm to check the consistency of partially ordered time, with a lower time complexity of $O^*((0.26n)^n)$ compared to existing algorithms. The algorithm enumerates structures similar to total orders and greedily expands towards a solution. This is achieved through significant new analysis for the fine-grained complexity of partially ordered time."
