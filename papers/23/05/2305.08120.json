    "abstract": "The cold start problem is a common challenge in various domains, including media use cases such as predicting viewership for newly launched shows on Over-The-Top (OTT) platforms. In this study, we propose a generic approach to tackle cold start problems by leveraging metadata and employing multi-model ensemble techniques. Our methodology includes feature engineering, model selection, and an ensemble approach based on a weighted average of predictions. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated using various performance metrics. Our results indicate that the multi-model ensemble approach significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to individual models.",
