    "translated_abstract": "由于获取完美的监督通常很困难，现实中的机器学习任务通常面临不准确、不完整或不精确的监督，统称为弱监督。在本文中，我们提出了WSAUC，一种用于解决弱监督下AUC优化问题的统一框架，它涵盖了噪声标签学习、正-无标签学习、多实例学习和半监督学习场景。在WSAUC框架内，我们首先将各种弱监督场景下的AUC优化问题框架化为最小化受污染集合上AUC风险的常见形式，并证明经验风险最小化问题与真实AUC一致。然后，我们介绍一种新型的部分AUC，即反转部分AUC（rpAUC），它作为鲁棒的AUC最大化训练目标，在存在污染标签的情况下发挥作用。WSAUC为各种弱监督场景下的AUC优化提供了一种通用解决方案。",
