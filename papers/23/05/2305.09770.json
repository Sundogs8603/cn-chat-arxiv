To improve the usefulness of XAI methods, a line of studies identifies the gaps between the diverse and dynamic real-world user needs with the status quo of XAI methods. Although prior studies envision mitigating these gaps by integrating multiple XAI methods into the universal XAI interfaces (e.g., conversational or GUI-based XAI systems), there is a lack of work investigating how these systems should be designed to meet practical user needs. In this study, we present ConvXAI, a conversational XAI system that incorporates multiple XAI types, and empowers users to request a variety of XAI questions via a universal XAI dialogue interface. Particularly, we innovatively embed practical user needs (i.e., four principles grounding on the formative study) into ConvXAI design to improve practical useful",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管已经提出了各种各样的人工智能解释（XAI）方法来解释AI系统，但目前的方法是否对人类实用仍存在不一致的发现。为了改善XAI方法的实用性，一系列研究确定了现实世界中多样化和动态的用户需求与现有XAI方法之间的差距。虽然之前的研究设想将多种XAI方法集成到通用XAI界面（例如，基于对话或GUI的XAI系统）中以减轻这些差距，但缺少针对这些系统如何设计以满足实际用户需求的研究。在本研究中，我们提出了ConvXAI，这是一个基于对话的XAI系统，它结合了多种XAI类型，并赋予用户通过通用的XAI对话界面提出各种XAI问题的能力。特别地，我们创新地将实际用户需求（即，基于格式研究的四个原则）嵌入ConvXAI设计中，以提高实用性。",
