    "translated_abstract": "在医疗保健系统中部署的机器学习（ML）模型必须面对不断演变的环境中获得的数据。然而，提出这样的模型的研究人员通常以与时间无关的方式进行评估，根据在整个研究时间段随机抽取的患者来拆分数据集。本文提出了一种Evaluation on Medical Datasets Over Time（EMDOT）框架，该框架评估模型在不同时间段性能的差异。受到反向测试概念的启发，EMDOT模拟实践者可能能够在每个时间点执行的潜在培训过程，并在所有未来时间点上评估所得到的模型。在六个不同的医疗数据源（表格和成像）上评估线性和更复杂的模型，我们展示了依赖于数据集，使用所有历史数据在许多情况下可能是理想的，而在其他情况下使用最近数据的窗口可能是有利的。在模型突然受到影响的数据集中，使用在相对较近的数据窗口上训练的模型是有帮助的。",
