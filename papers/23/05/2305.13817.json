    "abstract": "Objective:Develop and validate an algorithm for analyzing the layout of PDF clinical documents to improve the performance of downstream natural language processing tasks. Materials and Methods: We designed an algorithm to process clinical PDF documents and extract only clinically relevant text. The algorithm consists of several steps: initial text extraction using a PDF parser, followed by classification into categories such as body text, left notes, and footers using a Transformer deep neural network architecture, and finally an aggregation step to compile the lines of a given label in the text. We evaluated the technical performance of the body text extraction algorithm by applying it to a random sample of documents that were annotated. Medical performance was evaluated by examining the extraction of medical concepts of interest from the text in their respective sections. Finally, we tested an end-to-end system on a medical use case of automatic detection of acute infection described",
