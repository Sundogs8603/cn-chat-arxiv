    "translated_abstract": "开放政府数据被看作是一种政治和社会经济现象，可以促进市民参与并刺激公共领域的创新。为了带来预期的好处，数据必须被重用和转化为增值产品或服务。这要求数据不仅需要符合开放数据原则并可用，还必须具有价值，即被终端用户重用的兴趣。这涉及到“高价值数据集”（HVD）的概念，在2022年被欧洲数据门户认可为开放政府数据领域的关键趋势。虽然在这方面已经取得了进展，例如，开放数据指令，包括确定6个关键类别、一系列HVD的列表以及其发布和重用的安排，它们可以被视为旨在提高公共部门数据互操作性的“核心” /“基础”数据集，对于推动更成熟的开放政府数据倡议起到了重要作用。",
