    "translated_abstract": "由于避免了对手工规则的依赖，学习车辆路径问题（VRP）的启发式方法受到了广泛关注。然而，现有方法通常在固定大小和节点分布的同一任务上进行训练和测试，因此具有有限的泛化性能。本文研究了一个具有挑战性但又现实的场景，该场景考虑了VRP在大小和分布方面的一般性。我们提出了一种通用的元学习框架，在推理期间能够快速适应新任务的能力下对初始化模型进行有效训练。我们进一步开发了一种简单而有效的近似方法来减少训练开销。对旅行商问题（TSP）和容量车辆路径问题（CVRP）的合成和基准实例进行了广泛的实验证明了我们方法的有效性。代码可在https://github.com/RoyalSkye/Omni-VRP得到。",
