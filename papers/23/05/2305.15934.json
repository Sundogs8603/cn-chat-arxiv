    "translated_abstract": "径向索引机（RIM）因能够在无需手动重新定位的情况下执行多个生产步骤，从而缩短生产时间、提高精度和一致性，广泛用于制造业。尽管具有诸多优势，但在RIM中诊断故障的研究较少，尤其是从这些机器进行的实际生产步骤角度考虑。故障造成的长时间停机对于雇用这些机器的较小公司尤其是有问题的。为了弥补这一空白，我们基于产品角度提出了一种诊断算法，重点关注由 RIM 执行的产品。该算法跟踪产品在机器中经过的步骤，并能够诊断故障的可能原因。我们还分析了RIM的特性以及这些特性如何影响这些机器中的故障诊断。我们的贡献有三个方面。首先，我们提供了RIM特性的分析，",
