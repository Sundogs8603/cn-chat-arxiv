    "abstract": "Various research activities rely on citation-based impact indicators. However these indicators are usually globally computed, hindering their proper interpretation in applications like research assessment and knowledge discovery. In this work, we advocate for the use of topic-aware categorical impact indicators, to alleviate the aforementioned problem. In addition, we extend BIP! Services to support those indicators and showcase their benefits in real-world research activities.",

    "translated_abstract": "多种研究活动依赖于基于引用的影响指标。然而，这些指标通常是全局计算的，阻碍了它们在研究评估和知识发现等应用中的正确解释。在本研究中，我们倡导使用主题感知的分类影响指标，以缓解上述问题。此外，我们扩展了BIP!服务以支持这些指标，并展示它们在实际研究活动中的好处。",
