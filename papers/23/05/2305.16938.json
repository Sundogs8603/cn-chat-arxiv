    "translated_abstract": "少样本微调和上下文学习是预训练语言模型任务适应的两种替代策略。近期，上下文学习因其简单性和改善的跨域泛化能力而备受欢迎，因为大量证据表明微调模型会受到虚假相关性的影响。不幸的是，之前对这两种方法的比较使用的是不同大小的模型，这引发了一个问题：微调模型的跨域泛化能力是否是微调本身的固有属性，还是实验设置的局限性？本文利用模型大小、样本数量和参数数量等方面来进行公平的少样本微调和上下文学习的泛化比较，涉及的模型规模从125M到30B不等。研究结果表明，微调模型实际上能够很好地跨域泛化，发现这两种方法都是有效的，但在某些需要更复杂的推理和组合性的任务中，少样本微调的效果优于上下文学习。",

The results show that few-shot fine-tuned models perform better than in-context learning on some tasks requiring complex reasoning and compositionality."
