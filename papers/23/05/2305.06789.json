    "abstract": "Treatment effect estimation is of high-importance for both researchers and practitioners across many scientific and industrial domains. The abundance of observational data makes them increasingly used by researchers for the estimation of causal effects. However, these data suffer from biases, from several weaknesses, leading to inaccurate causal effect estimations, if not handled properly. Therefore, several machine learning techniques have been proposed, most of them focusing on leveraging the predictive power of neural network models to attain more precise estimation of causal effects. In this work, we propose a new methodology, named Nearest Neighboring Information for Causal Inference (NNCI), for integrating valuable nearest neighboring information on neural network-based models for estimating treatment effects.

    "translated_abstract": "治疗效果估计对于许多科学和工业领域的研究人员和从业者来说具有高度重要性。观察数据的丰富性使它们越来越受到研究人员用于因果效应的估计。然而，这些数据存在偏差和其他弱点，导致如果不正确处理，估计因果效应会不准确。因此，提出了几种机器学习技术，其中大部分都专注于利用神经网络模型的预测能力，以达到更精确的因果效应估计。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为最近邻居信息用于因果推断（NNCI）的新方法，用于将有价值的最近邻居信息集成到基于神经网络的模型中，以估计治疗效果。提出的NNCI方法被应用于一些最广泛使用的基于神经网络的治疗效果估计模型，其使用观察数据。",
