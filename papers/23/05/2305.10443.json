    "abstract": "Fully autonomous driving has been widely studied and is becoming increasingly feasible. However, such autonomous driving has yet to be achieved on public roads, because of various uncertainties due to surrounding human drivers and pedestrians. In this paper, we present an end-to-end learningbased autonomous driving system named SuperDriver AI, where Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) learn the driving actions and policies from the experienced human drivers and determine the driving maneuvers to take while guaranteeing road safety. In addition, to improve robustness and interpretability, we present a slit model and a visual attention module. We build a datacollection system and emulator with real-world hardware, and we also test the SuperDriver AI system with real-world driving scenarios. Finally, we have collected 150 runs for one driving scenario in Tokyo, Japan, and have shown the demonstration of SuperDriver AI with the real-world vehicle.",

    "translated_abstract": "自主驾驶已经得到广泛研究，并且正在变得越来越可行。然而，由于周围人类驾驶员和行人造成的各种不确定性，这种自主驾驶尚未在公共道路上实现。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为SuperDriver AI的端到端学习自主驾驶系统，其中深度神经网络（DNN）从有经验的人类驾驶员中学习驾驶动作和策略，并确定要采取的驾驶操作，同时保证道路安全。此外，为了提高鲁棒性和可解释性，我们提出了一种分裂模型和视觉注意模块。我们构建了一个具有真实硬件的数据收集系统和模拟器，并在真实世界驾驶场景中测试了SuperDriver AI系统。最后，我们在日本东京的一个驾驶场景中收集了150次测试，并演示了SuperDriver AI与真实车辆的配合表现。",
