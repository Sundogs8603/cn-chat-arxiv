    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了不精确标签学习（ILL）框架，这是一种处理机器学习任务中普遍存在的各种不精确标签配置的统一方法。ILL利用期望最大化（EM）算法对不精确标签信息进行最大似然估计（MLE），将精确标签视为潜在变量。与以前试图从不精确标签信息中推断正确标签的多功能方法相比，我们的ILL框架考虑了不精确标签信息强加的所有可能标签，允许对任何不精确标签的统一解决方案。通过全面的实验结果，我们展示了ILL可以无缝地适应各种情况，包括部分标签学习、半监督学习、噪声标签学习以及这些配置的混合。值得注意的是，我们的简单方法超过了现有的处理不精确标签的技术，标志着第一个统一解决这个问题的方法。",
