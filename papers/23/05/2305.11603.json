    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种无监督的意见摘要方法，将顾客评论中的句子编码为分层离散潜空间，然后根据其编码的频率确定常见意见。我们可以通过解码这些频繁的编码来生成抽象总结，并通过选择分配给相同频繁编码的句子来生成提取总结。由于模型将生成总结所用的句子识别为摘要过程的一部分，因此我们的方法可归因。我们的方法在潜空间中执行聚合而不是在长序列中执行聚合，因此可以轻松扩展到许多输入评论。此外，我们还展示了我们的方法可以通过将模型限制为与所需方面（例如位置或食品）相对应的编码空间部分来生成特定方面的摘要，具有一定的控制度。对来自不同领域的两个数据集的自动和人工评估表明，我们的方法优于几种竞争基线方法。",
