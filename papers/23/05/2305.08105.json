    "translated_abstract": "煤气是以太坊网络的交易费计量系统。网络的用户需要选择一个煤气价格来提交他们的交易，这会增加过高支付的风险，或者导致选择延迟/未处理的交易。本文研究了伦敦硬分叉后的数据，深入探讨了该分叉后网络的交易动态。因此，本文对2019年之前关于EthUSD BitUSD和煤气价格之间链接的工作进行了更新。为预测煤气价格，我们比较了一些机器学习方法，如直接递归混合LSTM、CNNLSTM和注意力LSTM等，结合小波阈值去噪和矩阵剖面数据处理，预测多个时间跨度上的5分钟内最低煤气价格。作为我们所知道的第一次将矩阵剖面应用于煤气价格数据和预测的研究，本研究证明矩阵配置是一种可行的交易费用预测方法。",
