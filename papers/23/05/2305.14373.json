    "translated_abstract": "大多数半监督学习（SSL）模型需要复杂的结构和迭代训练过程，以及面临解释其预测结果给用户的困难。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新的可解释的SSL模型，使用监督和非监督Adaptive Resonance Theory（ART）网络系列，称为SSL-ART。首先，SSL-ART采用非监督模糊ART网络来创建一些原型节点，使用未标记的样本。然后，它利用监督模糊ARTMAP结构，使用标记的样本将已建立的原型节点映射到目标类。具体来说，设计了一种一对多的映射方案，将原型节点与一个以上的类标签关联。SSL-ART的主要优点包括：（i）执行在线学习，（ii）通过OtM映射方案减少冗余原型节点并最小化噪声样本的影响，（iii）提供解释能力",
