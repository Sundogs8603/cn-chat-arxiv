    "translated_abstract": "本文讨论了互联网对现代交易的影响及由此产生的数据对机构改进市场营销的重要性。文章以Divar作为示例，在伊朗进行在线购买和销售产品与服务的市场，举办了一个预测汽车销售广告发布百分比的竞赛。由于数据集提供了丰富的波斯文本数据，作者使用Hazm库和两个最先进的语言模型，mBERT和ParsBERT来分析它。本文的主要目标是比较mBERT和ParsBERT在Divar数据集上的性能。作者提供了有关数据挖掘、波斯语言和两种语言模型的背景，检查数据集的组成和统计特征，并提供了他们对两种方法的微调和训练配置的详细说明。最终，他们评估和比较了mBERT和ParsBERT在预测汽车销售广告发布百分比方面的有效性，结果显示ParsBERT在准确度和f1分数方面均优于mBERT。",
