    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs），如GPT-3，已经成为通用语言模型，能够处理许多自然语言生成或理解任务。在机器翻译（MT）任务中，已有多项研究探索利用few-shot提示机制从LLMs中引出更好的翻译。然而，人们相对较少地关注这种翻译与标准神经机器翻译（NMT）模型生成翻译的质量差异。本研究从文字对齐和单调性等方面，比较了GPT和NMT生成翻译的文本文字积极度，发现GPT从英语（E-X）翻译的文本更不准确，但在MT质量评估指标上表现出相似或更好的分数。我们证明这一结果在人工评估中也得到了验证。同时，当翻译句子长度增加时，这种差别就尤为显著。",
