We introduce ALIA (Automated Language-guided Image Augmentation), a method which utilizes large vision and language models to automatically generate natural language descriptions of a dataset's domains and augment the training data via language-guided image editing.

    "translated_abstract": "许多细粒度分类任务，如罕见动物识别，训练数据有限，因此在这些数据集上训练的分类器通常无法推广到领域中的变化，如天气或位置的变化。因此，我们探索了如何使用训练数据中所见领域的自然语言描述与在多样的预训练数据集上训练的大型视觉模型结合，生成训练数据的有用变化。我们引入了ALIA（自动语言引导图像增强），这是一种利用大型视觉和语言模型自动生成数据集领域的自然语言描述，并通过语言引导图像编辑来扩充训练数据的方法。为了保持数据的完整性，原始数据集训练的模型会滤除最小的图像编辑和那些损坏类相关信息的编辑。最终的数据集在视觉上与原始训练数据一致，并提供了显著增强的多样性。",
