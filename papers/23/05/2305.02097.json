    "translated_abstract": "鸟类是监测生物多样性和栖息地健康的重要指标；它们在生态系统管理中也发挥着关键作用。鸟类数量的下降可能导致生态系统服务的降低，包括种子传播、授粉和害虫控制。对于生态学家来说，准确和长期地监测鸟类并识别关注物种，同时衡量保护干预的成功，至关重要。然而，监测工作耗时、昂贵，并且在长时间持续和大规模空间尺度上管理起来往往很困难。摄像陷阱、声学监测器和无人机等技术提供了非侵入性监测的方法。使用摄像陷阱进行监测存在两个主要问题：a）摄像机生成大量图像，使得在适时处理和分析数据变得困难；b）虚警比例高，使处理和分析难以汇报。在本文中，我们提出了一种方法来克服这些问题。",
    "tldr": "本文介绍了采用摄像陷阱和深度学习来消除鸟类监测中的瓶颈。通过该方法，减少了图像处理的工作量和虚警比例，提高了监测效率和准确性。",
