    "translated_abstract": "气候变化为房地产资产带来了新风险。考虑到大多数购房者使用贷款支付房屋，这些贷款的大多数被政府支持企业（GSE）购买，因此了解不断增加的自然灾害风险如何影响抵押贷款市场非常重要。气候证券化假设（CSH）认为，在自然灾害之后，贷款人会战略性地对GSE符合贷款证券化规则做出反应，这些规则创造了既有道德风险又有逆向选择效应的激励因素。包含在GSE抵押支持证券中的气候风险是由于复杂的证券化链条造成的，这种链条会产生监控和筛选激励不足的问题。我们调查了最近的理论文献和经验文献，探索筛选激励的影响。使用回归不连续性方法，我们测试了证券化文献中提出的关键假设，重点关注证券化动态。",
