We propose a Distantly Supervised Pyramid Network (DSPN) to efficiently perform Aspect-Category Detection, Aspect-Category Sentiment Analysis, and Rating Prediction using only document star rating labels for training. By performing these three related sentiment subtasks in an end-to-end manner, DSPN can extract aspects mentioned in the review, identify the corresponding sentiments, and predict the star rating labels.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了文档级端到端情感分析方法，可以通过星级评分标签对在线评论中表达的方面和评论情感进行有效的统一分析。我们假设星级评分标签是评论中各方面评分的“粗粒度综合”。我们提出了一种远程监督的金字塔网络（DSPN），只用文档星级评分标签进行训练，即可有效地执行方面-类别检测、方面-类别情感分析和评分预测。通过以端到端的方式执行这三个相关的情感子任务，DSPN可以提取评论中提到的方面，确定相应的情感，并预测星级评分标签。我们在英文和汉语多方面评论数据集上评估了DSPN，发现仅使用星级评分标签进行监督，DSPN的性能与各种基准模型相当。我们还展示了DSPN在评论上的可解释性输出，以说明金字塔网络的结构。",
