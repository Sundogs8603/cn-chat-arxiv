    "abstract": "As the impact of technology on our lives is increasing, we witness increased use of social media that became an essential tool not only for communication but also for sharing information with community about our thoughts and feelings. This can be observed also for people with mental health disorders such as depression where they use social media for expressing their thoughts and asking for help. This opens a possibility to automatically process social media posts and detect signs of depression. We build several large pre-trained language model based classifiers for depression detection from social media posts. Besides fine-tuning BERT, RoBERTA, BERTweet, and mentalBERT were also construct two types of ensembles. We analyze the performance of our models on two data sets of posts from social platforms Reddit and Twitter, and investigate also the performance of transfer learning across the two data sets. The results show that transformer ensembles improve over the single transformer-based",

    "translated_abstract": "随着科技在我们生活中的影响不断增强，社交媒体的使用也越来越普遍，它不仅是一种沟通工具，还可以用来向社区分享我们的观点和感受。对于抑郁症等心理健康问题，人们也会利用社交媒体来表达自己的想法寻求帮助。因此，我们可以通过自动处理社交媒体帖子并检测抑郁症的迹象来提供帮助。本文构建了大量的基于预训练语言模型的分类器，包括BERT、RoBERTA、BERTweet和mentalBERT，并构建了两种类型的集成模型。我们分析了模型在Reddit和Twitter两个社交平台上的表现，并研究了跨数据集的转移学习性能。结果表明，transformer集成模型比单一的transformer模型表现更好。",
