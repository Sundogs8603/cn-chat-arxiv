    "translated_abstract": "流形假说认为，高维数据通常位于较低维的流形上，并且利用该流形作为目标空间可以产生更有效的表示。虽然存在许多传统的基于流形的技术用于降维，但它们在自监督学习中的应用进展缓慢。最近的MSIMCLR方法将流形编码与SimCLR相结合，但需要极低的目标编码维度才能胜过SimCLR，从而限制了其适用性。本文介绍了一种使用不平衡图册（UA）的新型学习方法，能够超越最先进的自监督学习方法。我们通过系统地调整时空DeepInfomax（ST-DIM）框架以与我们提议的UA模式保持一致，并在整个过程中采用严谨的科学方法来精心研究和设计了使用UA的DeepInfomax（DIM-UA）方法。",
