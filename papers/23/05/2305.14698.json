    "abstract": "Venezuela has suffered three economic catastrophes since independence: one each in the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries. Prominent explanations for this trilogy point to the interaction of class conflict and resource dependence. We turn attention to intra-class conflict, arguing that the most destructive policy choices stemmed not from the rich defending themselves against the masses but rather from pitched battles among elites. Others posit that Venezuelan political institutions failed to sustain growth because they were insufficiently inclusive; we suggest in addition that they inadequately mediated intra-elite conflict.",

    "translated_abstract": "自独立以来，委内瑞拉经历了三次经济灾难：分别发生在19、20和21世纪。解释这一三部曲的重要因素之一是阶级冲突和资源依赖的相互作用。本文提出了一个新的观点，认为最具破坏性的政策选择并非是富人为了保护自己免受大众冲击的结果，而是由精英之间的激烈争斗导致的。此外，有人认为委内瑞拉政治制度未能保持增长，因为它们不够包容，我们认为还是缺乏调解精英内部冲突的制度。",
