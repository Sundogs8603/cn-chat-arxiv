    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence plays a main role in supporting and improving smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0, by enabling the automation of different types of tasks manually performed by domain experts. In particular, assessing the compliance of a product with the relative schematic is a time-consuming and prone-to-error process. In this paper, we address this problem in a specific industrial scenario. In particular, we define a Neuro-Symbolic approach for automating the compliance verification of the electrical control panels. Our approach is based on the combination of Deep Learning techniques with Answer Set Programming (ASP), and allows for identifying possible anomalies and errors in the final product even when a very limited amount of training data is available. The experiments conducted on a real test case provided by an Italian Company operating in electrical control panel production demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能在支持和改善智能制造和工业4.0方面发挥着重要作用，通过使领域专家手动执行的不同类型的任务自动化。特别是，评估产品与相对原理图的符合性是一项耗时且容易出错的过程。在本文中，我们针对特定的工业场景解决此问题。具体而言，我们定义了一种神经符号方法来自动化电气控制面板的合规性验证。我们的方法基于深度学习技术和答案集编程（ASP）的组合，即使只有非常有限的训练数据，也可以识别出最终产品中可能存在的异常和错误。通过意大利一家从事电气控制面板生产的公司提供的实际测试案例进行的实验表明了所提出方法的有效性。",
