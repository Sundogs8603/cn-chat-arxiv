    "abstract": "People who are visually impaired face a lot of difficulties while studying. One of the major causes to this is lack of available text in Bharti Braille script. In this paper, we have suggested a scheme to convert text in major Indian languages into Bharti Braille. The system uses a hybrid approach where at first the text in Indian language is given to a rule based system and in case if there is any ambiguity then it is resolved by applying a LSTM based model. The developed model has also been tested and found to have produced near accurate results.",
