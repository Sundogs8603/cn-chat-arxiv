    "translated_abstract": "在对话研究中，轻松构建端到端任务机器人并以最小的人力投入维护其与新功能的集成是一个长期存在的挑战。最近，大型语言模型（LLM）在各种下游任务中展示了卓越的对话能力和遵循指令的能力。在这项工作中，我们介绍了SGP-TOD，一种基于LLM的模式引导提示，用于轻松构建面向任务的对话系统。利用符号知识--任务模式，我们指导固定的LLM在新任务上生成适当的响应，避免了训练数据的需求。具体而言，SGP-TOD包括三个组件：用于与用户交互的LLM，用于帮助LLM进行对话状态跟踪的DST提示器，以及用于引出符合提供的对话策略的适当响应的策略提示器。在Multiwoz、RADDLE和STAR数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的无需训练的策略显著优于几个最先进的基线。",
