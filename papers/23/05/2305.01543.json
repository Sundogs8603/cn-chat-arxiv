    "translated_abstract": "洗钱交易是一种市场操纵形式，指同一实体通过向自己销售资产来推高市场价格、在合法交易的掩护下洗钱，或声称进行资产损失税收减免而不失去资产所有权。传统资产市场对此加以监管，但非同质化代币市场监督缺失，使犯罪分子能够进行洗钱交易并欺骗毫无戒心的买家而逃脱监管。AnChain.AI设计了一种算法，当钱包在30天内重新购买先前卖出的代币时，标记NFT收藏历史中的交易为洗钱交易。该算法还识别了洗钱交易周期内的中间交易。针对7个热门NFT收藏品进行测试后发现，每个收藏品中平均有0.14%的交易、0.11%的钱包和0.16%的代币涉及洗钱交易。这些洗钱交易带来了总体价格操纵、销售和回购利润达到了90万美元和110万美元。",
