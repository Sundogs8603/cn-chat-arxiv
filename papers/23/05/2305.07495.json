    "translated_abstract": "深度学习方法在人脸识别中取得了极大的成功。但是，为了提高性能，收集和标记尽可能多的图像是一项重要的任务。然而，标识数据和检查大量图像数据的质量是困难的任务，并且在处理大数据时不能避免错误。之前的工作一直试图解决训练数据中的问题，然而，如果错误出现在人脸识别的图库数据中，会带来更为严重的问题。我们提出了一种对异常值具有鲁棒性的图库数据采样方法，包括错误标记、低质量和信息较少的图像，并减少了搜索时间。我们提出的采样-修剪和采样-生成方法在5.4M个名人网络图像数据集上显著提高了人脸识别性能。在FPIR=0.01的情况下，我们的方法在FNIR方面达到了0.0975，而传统方法则显示为0.3891。平均特征向量数量减少了",
