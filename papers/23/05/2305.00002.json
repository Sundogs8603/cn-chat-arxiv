    "translated_abstract": "大数据已成为天文学领域的常态，这使得它成为计算机科学研究的理想领域。天文学家通常根据星系形态来分类星系，这一做法可追溯至1936年的哈勃。在小型数据集上，可以通过个人或小团队进行分类，但现代望远镜带来的数据呈指数级增长，需要自动分类方法。该研究探讨了颜色空间变换对分类准确性的影响，并探究了CNN架构对该关系的影响。考虑到多种颜色空间（RGB、XYZ、LAB等）和CNN架构（VGG、ResNet、DenseNet、Xception等），利用预训练的模型和权重。然而，由于大多数预训练模型是在自然图像的背景下开发的，因此本研究还调查了使用迁移学习将这些模型适应于星系分类的效果。实验结果显示，利用迁移学习的多种颜色空间的CNNs集成比单个模型表现更好，并在Kaggle Galaxy Zoo数据集上实现了最先进的准确性。",
