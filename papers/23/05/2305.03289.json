    "abstract": "Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has gained significant attention as an image segmentation foundation model due to its strong performance on various downstream tasks. However, it has been found that SAM does not always perform satisfactorily when faced with challenging downstream tasks. This has led downstream users to demand a customized SAM model that can be adapted to these downstream tasks. In this paper, we present BadSAM, the first backdoor attack on the image segmentation foundation model. Our preliminary experiments on the CAMO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of BadSAM.",
