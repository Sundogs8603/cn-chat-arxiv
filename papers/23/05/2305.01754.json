    "translated_abstract": "神经网络常常将高置信度分配给其预测结果，即使是对于远离数据分布的点，这使得不确定性量化成为一项挑战。当它们被用于模拟材料系统中的原子间势时，这个问题会导致不真实的结构破坏模拟，或者导致偏误的统计和动力学不能反映真正的物理学。可微不确定性量化技术可以发现新的信息数据，推动鲁棒势的主动学习循环。然而，对于原子模拟存在各种不确定性量化技术，包括新开发的技术，不存在清晰的指导方针以确定哪种技术最为有效或适合特定情况。在本文中，我们比较了多个UQ方案来改进NN原子间势（NNIPs）的鲁棒性，特别是我们将现有的基于集合的方法与使用单一的确定性NNs的策略进行了比较：平均差异估计，深度证据回归和异方差回归。令人惊讶的是，我们发现集合方法在多个材料系统和UQ指标上表现一致更好，这表明它们在某些情况下仍然与更高效的单模型替代品竞争力相当，有时甚至更好。",
