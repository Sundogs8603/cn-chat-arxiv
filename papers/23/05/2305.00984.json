There is a forth value, too, that can represent a non-existing bit (vacuum-state) that is the same (1 numeric value) for all bits, however that is a squeezed state common for all bits. Some logic gates are explored. The ternary Universe has a significant advantage compared to the standard binary one: its amplitude is never zero during any clock period. All the known binary logic gates work for the binary bit values in the same way as earlier therefore the former binary algorithms can be run in the ternary system with no change and without the problems posed by zero values of the Universe.",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了一种三值瞬时噪声逻辑的可能表示方法。第三个值是不确定的比特值，在人工智能应用中可能会有用。同时，还有第四个值，它可以表示不存在的比特（真空态），对于所有比特来说，它是相同的（1个数值），但却是所有比特的压缩态。一些逻辑门也进行了探讨。三元宇宙与标准的二元宇宙相比有着显著的优势：在任何时钟周期内，其幅度永远不为零。所有已知的二进制逻辑门在二元比特值上的工作方式与先前相同，因此旧的二进制算法可以在三元系统中运行，而不需要改变，并且不会出现宇宙零值所带来的问题。",
