    "abstract": "Despite the many use cases for large language models (LLMs) in the design of chatbots in various industries and the research showing the importance of personalizing chatbots to cater to different personality traits, little work has been done to evaluate whether the behaviors of personalized LLMs can reflect certain personality traits accurately and consistently. We consider studying the behavior of LLM-based simulated agents which refer to as LLM personas and present a case study with GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) to investigate whether LLMs can generate content with consistent, personalized traits when assigned Big Five personality types and gender roles. We created 320 LLM personas (5 females and 5 males for each of the 32 Big Five personality types) and prompted them to complete the classic 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI) and then write an 800-word story about their childhood. Results showed that LLM personas' self-reported BFI scores are consistent with their assigned personality typ",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型在各个行业的聊天机器人设计中有许多用途，并且研究表明个性化聊天机器人在满足不同人格特征方面的重要性，但很少有研究评估个性化LLM的行为是否能够准确、一致地反映某些人格特征。我们考虑研究基于LLM的模拟代理的行为，称之为LLM personas，并使用GPT-3.5（text-davinci-003）进行案例研究，以研究LLM在分配大五人格类型和性别角色时是否可以生成具有一致性的个性化特质的内容。我们创建了320个LLM personas（每种大五人格类型有5个女性和5个男性），并提示他们完成经典的44项大五人格问卷（BFI），然后撰写一个关于他们童年的800字故事。结果表明，LLM personas的自我报告的BFI分数与他们分配的人格类型一致。",
