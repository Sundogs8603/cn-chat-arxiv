    "abstract": "Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is one of the core components of a task-oriented dialogue system, which aims to extract the semantic meaning of user queries (e.g., intents and slots). In this work, we introduce OpenSLU, an open-source toolkit to provide a unified, modularized, and extensible toolkit for spoken language understanding. Specifically, OpenSLU unifies 10 SLU models for both single-intent and multi-intent scenarios, which support both non-pretrained and pretrained models simultaneously. Additionally, OpenSLU is highly modularized and extensible by decomposing the model architecture, inference, and learning process into reusable modules, which allows researchers to quickly set up SLU experiments with highly flexible configurations. OpenSLU is implemented based on PyTorch, and released at \\url{https://github.com/LightChen233/OpenSLU}.",

    "translated_abstract": "语音理解是任务型对话系统的核心组件之一，旨在提取用户查询（例如意图和槽位）的语义含义。本文介绍了OpenSLU，一个开源工具包，提供了统一、模块化、可扩展的语音理解解决方案。具体而言，OpenSLU将10种针对单意图和多意图场景的语音理解模型统一起来，同时支持非预训练和预训练模型。此外，OpenSLU具有高度模块化和可扩展性，通过将模型架构、推理和学习过程分解为可重用模块，允许研究人员以高度灵活的配置快速设置语音理解实验。OpenSLU基于PyTorch实现，并在\\url{https://github.com/LightChen233/OpenSLU}上发布。",
