    "abstract": "How do language models \"think\"? This paper formulates a probabilistic cognitive model called the bounded pragmatic speaker, which can characterize the operation of different variations of language models. Specifically, we demonstrate that large language models fine-tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022) embody a model of thought that conceptually resembles a fast-and-slow model (Kahneman, 2011), which psychologists have attributed to humans. We discuss the limitations of reinforcement learning from human feedback as a fast-and-slow model of thought and propose avenues for expanding this framework. In essence, our research highlights the value of adopting a cognitive probabilistic modeling approach to gain insights into the comprehension, evaluation, and advancement of language models.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个概率认知模型，称为有限实用说话者，用于表征不同变体的语言模型的操作方式。特别地，我们展示了经过人类反馈的强化学习微调的大型语言模型（Ouyang等人，2022）具有概念上类似于 快与慢思考模型（Kahneman，2011）的思维模型，而这种思维模型被心理学家们归因于人类。我们讨论了从人类反馈中的强化学习作为快与慢思考模型的局限性，并提出了扩展这个框架的途径。本研究实质上凸显了采用认知概率建模方法来获得对语言模型的理解、评估和推进方面的深刻见解的价值。",
