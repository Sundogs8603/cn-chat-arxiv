    "abstract": "Objective: The Electroencephalogram (EEG) is gaining popularity as a physiological measure for neuroergonomics in human factor studies because it is objective, less prone to bias, and capable of assessing the dynamics of cognitive states. This study investigated the associations between memory workload and EEG during participants' typical office tasks on a single-monitor and dual-monitor arrangement. We expect a higher memory workload for the single-monitor arrangement. Approach: We designed an experiment that mimics the scenario of a subject performing some office work and examined whether the subjects experienced various levels of memory workload in two different office setups: 1) a single-monitor setup and 2) a dual-monitor setup. We used EEG band power, mutual information, and coherence as features to train machine learning models to classify high versus low memory workload states. Main results: The study results showed that these characteristics exhibited significant differences t",

    "translated_abstract": "目的：脑电图(electroencephalogram, EEG)作为神经工效学的一种生理测量，因为具有客观性、不易受到偏见的影响，能够评估认知状态的动态变化，在人类因素研究中越来越受欢迎。本研究研究了记忆负荷与EEG之间的关联，在参与者在单显示器和双显示器设置下进行典型办公任务期间，我们预计单显示器的情况下将具有更高的记忆负荷。方法：我们设计了一个实验，模拟了被试执行一些办公工作的场景，并检查了被试在两种不同的办公桌面设置（单显示器设置和双显示器设置）下是否经历了不同水平的记忆工作负荷。我们使用EEG带功率、互信息和相干性作为特征，训练机器学习模型来分类高负荷和低负荷状态。主要结果：研究结果显示这些特征表现出显著的差异...",
