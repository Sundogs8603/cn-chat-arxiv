    "translated_abstract": "电子健康记录（EHR）数据越来越多地用于支持实际证据（RWE）研究。然而，它生成可靠的RWE的能力受到限制，因为缺乏有关临床事件的时间（例如心力衰竭发作时间）的精确信息。本文提出了一种标签高效的事件类型标注算法（LATTE），以准确标注纵向EHR数据中的临床事件时间。通过利用预先训练的语义嵌入向量，根据与目标事件的关系挖掘它们的相关性，LATTE在概念重新加权模块中选择具有预测能力的EHR特征，并通过访问注意力学习网络将其信息压缩为纵向访问嵌入。LATTE使用递归神经网络捕捉目标事件之前/之后的顺序依赖关系和访问嵌入。为了提高标签效率，LATTE通过时间模式挖掘构建高度信息化的纵向银标准事件标签（SSEL），利用未标记的观测数据提高模型的泛化能力。在MIMIC-III数据集上的结果表明，LATTE优于最先进的方法，在预测急性肾损伤发作方面，在精确度和召回率方面分别实现了7.57％和10.82％的绝对改善。",
