    "translated_abstract": "语言在如何将世界分为概念和词汇方面存在差异；例如，与英语不同，斯瓦希里语有一个单一的概念来表示“肚子”和“子宫”。我们通过在平行语料库中对齐概念，调查1,335种语言之间的这些差异。为此，我们提出了Conceptualizer方法，它创建了一个源语言概念和一组目标语言字符串之间的二分有向对齐图。通过对一个概念（“鸟”）进行所有语言的详细语言分析，并在32个Swadesh概念的黄金标准数据上进行评估，我们证明了Conceptualizer具有良好的对齐精度。我们通过两个实验展示了NLP中概念表达研究的潜力。第一个实验我们定义了横跨多种语言的稳定性概念，并证明了具象程度可以预测其稳定性。第二个实验我们通过83个概念的概念表达模式，来代表每种语言，并定义了一种多维语言分类方法，它可以帮助填补现有NLP模型的不足。",
    "tldr": "通过一个新方法，该论文探索了1335种语言之间在概念表达方面的差异，并发现了能够预测一种概念是否会跨越多种语言，以及如何代表每种语言的多维分类方法，这有助于解决现有自然语言处理模型的不足。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the differences in conceptualization across 1,335 languages using a new method called Conceptualizer, which aligns concepts in a parallel corpus. The authors demonstrate the potential of research on conceptualization in NLP and provide insights into the crosslingual stability of concepts and a novel way to represent each language by its conceptualization pattern."
