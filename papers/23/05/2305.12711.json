    "translated_abstract": "无监督学习可见-红外人员再识别(USL-VI-ReID)旨在从未标记的跨模态数据集中学习模态不变特征，这在视频监控系统等实际应用中至关重要。解决跨模态数据关联问题对于进一步进行异质联合学习非常关键。针对这个问题，我们提出了一个双重最优传输标签分配(DOTLA)框架，同时将一个模态中生成的标签分配给其对应的模态。所提出的DOTLA机制formulate了一种相互增强和高效的跨模态数据关联解决方案，可以有效地减少一些不足和噪声标签关联的副作用。此外，我们还提出了一个跨模态邻居一致性引导的标签精炼和正则化模块，在相应模态中邻居样本的指导下消除由不准确的监督信号带来的负面影响。在两个基准数据集上的大量实验证明，所提出的USL-VI-ReID模型与现有的无监督方法甚至一些有监督方法相比，实现了最先进的性能。",
