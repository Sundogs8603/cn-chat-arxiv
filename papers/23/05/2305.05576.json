    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）在最近几个月和几周内取得了快速进展，引起了广泛关注。这引发了有关将这些模型与人类价值观保持一致、它们对劳动力市场的影响以及进一步研究和开发的潜在需要进行监管的担忧。然而，这种讨论通常缺乏关注迫切性，即广泛传播LLM的社会效益。为了确定这种社会效益，我们断言LLM表现出比以前的技术更有效地使技术人性化的新能力，并且适用于跨越语言、职业和可访问性分歧的人们。我们认为它们这样做是通过解决当今计算技术中的三个机械化瓶颈实现的：创建多样化和可访问的内容、学习复杂的数字工具以及个性化机器学习算法。我们采用基于案例的方法，并用两个示例说明每个瓶颈，其中当前技术施加瓶颈，而LLM证明了相反的效果。",
