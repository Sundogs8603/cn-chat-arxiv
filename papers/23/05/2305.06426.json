    "translated_abstract": "糖尿病是全球健康优先事项，尤其是在低收入和中等收入国家，超过50%的早逝归因于高血糖。多项研究已经证明使用社区卫生工作者（CHW）计划提供早期发现和管理糖尿病的可承受和文化定制解决方案的可行性。然而，还没有提出可扩展的模型来设计和实施CHW计划，同时考虑筛查、管理和患者招募决策。我们引入了一个优化框架来确定个性化的CHW访问，以在社区水平上最大化血糖控制。我们的框架明确建模了筛查新患者和为已经入治疗的个体提供管理访问之间的权衡。我们考虑患者的动机状态，这影响他们决定入治疗或退出的决定，因此影响干预的有效性。我们结合这些因素来实现智能个性化的CHW访问计划。",
