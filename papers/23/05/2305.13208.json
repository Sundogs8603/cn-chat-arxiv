    "translated_abstract": "多模态学习涉及开发能够整合来自各种来源（如图像和文本）信息的模型。在这一领域中，多模态文本生成是一个关键的方面，它涉及处理来自多个模态的数据并输出文本。图像引导的故事结局生成（IgSEG）是一个特别重要的任务，旨在理解文本和图像数据之间的复杂关系，并生成完整的故事结局文本。不幸的是，最近的IgSEG模型的基础是深度神经网络，这些网络容易受到对抗样本的攻击。当前的对抗攻击方法主要集中在单模态数据上，并未分析用于使用跨模态信息的多模态文本生成任务的对抗攻击。为此，我们提出了一种迭代对抗攻击方法（Iterative-attack），融合了图像和文本模态的攻击，以更有效的迭代方式搜索对抗文本和图像。",
