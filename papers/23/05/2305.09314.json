    "translated_abstract": "在集中市场机制中，个体可能无法完全观察其他参与者的类型报告。因此，机制设计者可能会偏离承诺的机制，而个体无法检测到这些偏差。本文为分配和社会选择问题开发了一个可审计性的通用理论。我们发现着名机制的审计性之间存在明显差异：立即接受机制在某种程度上是最大可审计的，因为只有两个个体就可以检测到任何偏差，而另一方面，延迟接受机制在某种程度上是最小可审计的，因为除非某些个体拥有关于每个人报告的全部信息，否则可能会漏掉一些偏差。第一价格和第二价格拍卖机制也存在类似差异。此外，我们给出了对于社会选择问题的多数表决机制的简单描述，并评估了审计性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper develops a general theory of auditability for allocation and social choice problems, showing significant differences between the auditabilities of various mechanisms. The Immediate Acceptance mechanism is found to be maximally auditable, while the Deferred Acceptance mechanism is minimally auditable, and the first-price and second-price auction mechanisms also show differences in auditability. The paper provides a simple characterization of the majority voting mechanism and evaluates its auditability."
