We utilize the IEEExtreme Challenge competition as a benchmark, a prestigious, annual international programming contest encompassing a wide range of problems with different complexities. To conduct a thorough evaluation, we selected and executed a diverse set of 102 challenges, drawn from five distinct IEEExtreme editions, using three major programming languages: Python, Java, and C++.

    "translated_abstract": "自从ChatGPT发布以来，许多研究已经突出了ChatGPT的卓越性能，它在各种任务和领域中往往可以与甚至超越人类能力。然而，本文通过展示人类表现优异的实例，提出了一个对立的观点，特别是在计算机编程领域的典型ChatGPT任务中。我们将IEEExtreme编程挑战赛作为基准进行全面评估，这是一个包含各种复杂度问题的知名国际编程竞赛。为了进行彻底的评估，我们选择了102个来自五个不同IEEExtreme版本的挑战，使用三种主要编程语言Python、Java和C++进行执行。我们的经验分析提供了证据，证明与普遍认为的相反，人类程序员在编程环境中的问题解决的某些方面上仍然具有竞争优势。",
