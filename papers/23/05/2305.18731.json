    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度模型在许多视觉任务中取得了显著的成功。但是，它们的性能很大程度上取决于密集的训练样本。相比之下，人类通常执行混合学习，例如自发地将结构化知识用于跨领域识别，或者仅使用极少量的数据样本进行少样本学习。因此，通过无缝地将结构化知识与数据样本集成，实现更有效的表示学习，可以将这种混合学习方法扩展到计算机视觉任务中。然而，由于结构化知识和深度特征（从数据样本中学习）在维度和知识粒度上存在巨大差距，因此这样的混合学习方法仍然是一个巨大的挑战。本文提出了一种新的认知图层（EGLayer），以实现混合学习，从而在深度特征和结构化知识图之间更有效地交换信息。具体来说，EGLayer将深度特征作为输入，并构建知识图，将结构化知识传播到深度特征上。这种混合表示学习方法在几个基准数据集（包括少样本学习和零样本分类任务）上进行了评估，并与最先进的方法相比，取得了卓越的性能。",
