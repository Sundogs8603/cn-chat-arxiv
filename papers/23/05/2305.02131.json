    "abstract": "Although procedural generation is popular among game developers, academic research on the topic has primarily focused on new applications, with some research into empirical analysis. In this paper we relate theoretical work in information theory to the generation of content for games. We prove that there is a relationship between the Kolomogorov complexity of the most complex artifact a generator can produce, and the size of that generator's possibility space. In doing so, we identify the limiting relationship between the knowledge encoded in a generator, the density of its output space, and the intricacy of the artifacts it produces. We relate our result to the experience of expert procedural generator designers, and illustrate it with some examples.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管程序化生成在游戏开发者中很受欢迎，但学术研究主要集中在新应用上，一些研究则着重于实证分析。本文将信息论的理论工作与游戏内容生成联系在一起。我们证明了一种生成器能够产生的最复杂制品的 Kolomogorov 复杂度与该生成器可能空间的大小之间存在关系。在这样做的过程中，我们确定了一个知识编码在生成器中、输出空间的密度以及所产生的制品复杂性之间的限制关系。我们将结果与专家程序生成器设计者的经验联系起来，并用一些例子加以说明。",
