    "translated_abstract": "谱时图神经网络是大多数基于图神经网络(GNN)的时间序列预测模型的一个有前途的抽象。然而，我们需要更多关于这种方法的基础知识。本文建立了一个理论框架，揭示了谱时GNN的表现力。我们的结果表明，具有线性谱时GNN是普适的，在温和的假设下，它们的表现力受到我们的离散时间动态图扩展的第一阶Weisfeiler-Leman算法的限制。为了使我们的发现在实践中有用，我们详细讨论了相关限制，并概述了在谱域中设计空间和时间模块的理论蓝图。基于这些见解，并为了展示基于我们的框架，谱时GNN有多么强大，我们提出了一个名为 Temporal Graph GegenConv (TGC) 的简单实例，显著优于大多数已有的模型。",
