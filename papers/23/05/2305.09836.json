    "translated_abstract": "近年来，离线强化学习取得了显着的进展，出现了许多具有不同复杂度的算法。虽然这些算法带来了显著的改进，但很多算法包含了看似微不足道的设计选择，这些选择对算法的有效性产生了影响，超出了核心算法的进步。然而，这些设计选择对于已有基线算法的影响尚未得到充分研究。在这项工作中，我们旨在通过对近期离线强化学习研究的回顾性分析，提出一种名为ReBRAC的极简算法，该算法在TD3+BC方法的基础上整合了这些设计元素。我们使用D4RL和V-D4RL基准测试评估了ReBRAC在51个具有自我感知和视觉状态空间的数据集上的性能，证明了其在不需要集成的方法中处于领先地位。为了进一步说明这些设计选择的有效性，我们进行了大规模消融研究和超参数敏感性分析，揭示了ReBRAC的成功源于其基于策略改进和评论家正则化的原则性设计选择。",
