    "abstract": "A long tradition of studies in psycholinguistics has examined the formation and generalization of ad hoc conventions in reference games, showing how newly acquired conventions for a given target transfer to new referential contexts.

This paper presents two dyadic studies (N = 240) that address this axis of generalization, focusing on the role of nameability -- the a priori likelihood that two individuals will share the same label. We leverage the recently-released KiloGram dataset, a collection of abstract tangram images that is orders of magnitude larger than previously available, exhibiting high diversity of properties like nameability. Our first study asks how nameability shapes convention formation, while the second asks how new conventions generalize to entirely new targets of reference",

    "translated_abstract": "语言心理学的长期研究传统一直在研究指称游戏中的特殊惯例的形成和泛化，展示了新目标的习得的惯例如何转移到新的指涉情境中。但是，另一个广泛化的轴却鲜有研究：当特定词汇选择不太可能重复时，形成的约定如何转移到完全不同的目标。本文介绍了两个双人研究（N=240），着重探讨可命名性的作用——两个个体共享相同标签的先验可能性。我们利用最近发布的KiloGram数据集，该数据集是之前可用数据集规模的数量级，展示了高可命名性等属性的高多样性抽象图案。我们的第一项研究探讨了可命名性如何形成惯例，而第二项则探讨了新的规则如何泛化到完全不同的指涉目标。",
