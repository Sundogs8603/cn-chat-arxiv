    "translated_abstract": "面对电力行业脱碳的迫切需求，重新设计电力市场是一种宏观层面的方法，以适应可再生能源的高渗透率，并实现电力系统的操作安全、经济效率和环境友好性。然而，现有的市场设计方法学存在于能源现货市场（ESM）、辅助服务市场（ASM）和金融市场（FM）之间协调不足，即“联合市场”，以及缺乏可靠的基于模拟的验证。为了解决这些缺陷，本文将基于强化学习（RL）的模拟，开发联合市场设计的范型理论和详细方法。第一部分提出了这种新型市场设计哲学的理论和框架。首先，总结了在设计联合市场时存在的有争议的市场设计选项作为目标研究问题。其次，提出了马尔可夫博弈模型。",
    "tldr": "本文提出基于强化学习的方法，设计联合市场以应对电力行业脱碳，实现电力系统的安全和经济效益，并为环境做出贡献。该范型理论的框架将在两部分中详细介绍。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a reinforcement-learning-based approach for designing a joint market to address decarbonization in the power industry, achieve power system security and economic efficiency, and contribute to the environment. The paradigmatic theory and framework of this novel market design philosophy will be introduced in detail in two parts."
