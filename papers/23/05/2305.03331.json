    "translated_abstract": "定位多维数据的根本原因对于确保在线服务系统的可靠性至关重要。当出现故障时，只有特定属性组合内的测量值异常。这些属性组合是下层根本原因的重要线索，因此被称为多维数据的根本原因。本论文提出了一种多维数据的通用且鲁棒的根本原因定位方法PSqueeze。我们提出了一种多维数据根本原因的通用特性——广义串扰效应(GRE)。基于此，我们提出了一种新的概率聚类方法和鲁棒启发式搜索方法。此外，我们确定了确定外部根本原因的重要性，并首次在文献中提出了一种有效的方法。我们对两个真实世界的数据集进行了实验，涉及5400个故障，在所有情况下，PSqueeze的F1得分优于基线32.89％，定位时间约为10秒。外部根本原因的F1得分比基线高39.86％。",
