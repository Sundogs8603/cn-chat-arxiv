New methods with inductive learning capacity will be needed to identify these novel operations before they indelibly alter public opinion and events. We develop an inductive learning framework which: 1) determines content- and graph-based indicators that are not specific to any operation; 2) uses graph learning to encode abstract signatures of coordinated manipulation; and 3) evaluates generalization capacity by training and testing models across operations originating from Russia, China, and Iran.

    "translated_abstract": "影响行动是一种大规模操作，旨在操纵公众舆论。快速检测和干扰这些操作对健康的公共话语至关重要。新兴AI技术可能会启用新的操作方法，这些方法可以规避当前的检测方法，并在社交媒体上影响更大的规模、范围和特异性。为了在这些新操作改变公众意见和事件之前识别这些新操作，需要具有归纳学习能力的新方法。我们开发了一种归纳学习框架，它：1)确定不特定于任何操作的基于内容和图形的指标；2)使用图学习来编码协调操纵的抽象标志；3)通过对来自俄罗斯、中国和伊朗的操作进行训练和测试来评估泛化能力。我们发现，这种框架能够在跨操作泛化方面展现出强大的能力，同时也揭示了显著的指标。",
    "tldr": "本文开发了一种新的归纳式学习框架，可以检测影响行动的操作。该框架能够确定与任何操作无关的指标，使用图学习来编码协调操纵的抽象标志，并在不同操作之间进行跨操作泛化，有望为预防影响行动提供帮助。"
