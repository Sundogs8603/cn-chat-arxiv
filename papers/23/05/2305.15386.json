In this paper, we focus on Indian languages, and make the case that diverse benchmarks are required to evaluate and improve ASR systems for Indian languages. To address this, we collate Vistaar as a set of 59 benchmarks across various language and domain combinations, on which we evaluate 3 publicly available ASR systems and 2 commercial systems. We also train IndicWhisper models by fine-tuning the Whisper models on publicly available training datasets across 12 Indian languages totalling to 10.7K hours. We show that IndicWhisper significantly improves on considered ASR systems on the Vistaar benchmark. Indeed, IndicWhisper has the lowest WER in 39 out of the 59 benchmarks, with an average reduction of 4.1 WER. We open-source all datasets, code and models.",

    "translated_abstract": "改进ASR系统是让全球范围内的新LLM基于用例可用的必要条件。在本文中，我们专注于印度语言，并且提出多样化的基准用于评估和改进印度语音ASR系统。为此，我们整理了Vistaar作为由59个基准组成的数据集，涵盖了不同语言和领域的组合，在这些基准上我们评估了3个公共ASR系统和2个商业系统。我们还通过在12种印度语言上对公开可用的训练数据集进行微调，训练了IndicWhisper模型，总共达到了10.7K小时。我们表明，IndicWhisper在Vistaar基准上显著改进了被考虑的ASR系统。实际上，IndicWhisper在59个基准中有39个基准具有最低的WER，平均降低了4.1的WER。我们开源了所有的数据集，代码和模型。",
