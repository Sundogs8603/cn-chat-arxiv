In this paper, we present our work of iteratively engaging therapists and post-stroke survivors to design, develop, and evaluate a social robot exercise coaching system for personalized rehabilitation. Through interviews with therapists, we designed how this system interacts with the user and then developed an interactive social robot exercise coaching system.

    "translated_abstract": "社交辅助机器人被越来越多地探索用于改善老年人和残疾人参与与健康相关的锻炼。然而，即使人们有各种各样的身体状况，大多数以前的社交机器人锻炼辅导系统在回馈方面都使用通用的预定义的回馈。这些系统的部署仍然是一个挑战。在本文中，我们通过与治疗师和中风幸存者的访谈来设计、开发和评估一个个性化康复社交机器人。我们与治疗师进行访谈，设计了系统用户的交互方式，然后开发了一个交互式社交机器人锻炼辅导系统。该系统将神经网络模型与基于规则的模型相结合，自动监测和评估患者的康复锻炼，并可以根据个体患者的数据调整，为每个患者生成实时的个性化矫正反馈。",
