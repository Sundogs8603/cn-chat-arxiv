    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了在图学习任务中的缺失特征补全问题。过去有几种方法已经解决了具有缺失特征的图形学习任务。然而，对于高缺失特征率的情况，它们无法避免显著的性能下降。为了克服这个限制，我们引入了一个新的概念，即节点特征中的信道置信度，它被指定给每个节点的填充信道特征，以反映填充的确定性。然后，我们设计了伪置信度，使用缺失特征节点与其最近的已知特征节点之间的信道最短路径距离来替换实际学习过程中缺失的真实置信度。基于伪置信度，我们提出了一种新的特征插值方案，它执行信道内节点扩散和节点内信道传播。该方案可以在非常高的缺失率下（例如，99.5％）持久存在，并且实现了最先进的准确性。",
