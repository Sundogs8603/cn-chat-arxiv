    "abstract": "We present MindEye, a novel fMRI-to-image approach to retrieve and reconstruct viewed images from brain activity. Our model comprises two parallel submodules that are specialized for retrieval (using contrastive learning) and reconstruction (using a diffusion prior). MindEye can map fMRI brain activity to any high dimensional multimodal latent space, like CLIP image space, enabling image reconstruction using generative models that accept embeddings from this latent space. We comprehensively compare our approach with other existing methods, using both qualitative side-by-side comparisons and quantitative evaluations, and show that MindEye achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction and retrieval tasks. In particular, MindEye can retrieve the exact original image even among highly similar candidates indicating that its brain embeddings retain fine-grained image-specific information. This allows us to accurately retrieve images even from large-scale databases like LAION-5",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了MindEye，一种新颖的fMRI到图像的方法，可以从大脑活动中检索和重建视觉图像。我们的模型由两个并行子模块组成，分别用于检索（使用对比学习）和重建（使用扩散先验）。MindEye可以将fMRI脑活动映射到任何高维多模态潜在空间，如CLIP图像空间，从而使用接受来自该潜在空间嵌入的生成模型进行图像重建。我们全面比较了我们的方法与其他现有方法，包括定性的并排比较和定量评估，并展示了MindEye在重建和检索任务中达到了最先进的性能。特别是，MindEye可以在高度相似的候选项中准确检索到原始图像，表明其脑嵌入保留了细粒度的图像特定信息。这使我们能够从大规模数据库中准确地检索图像，如LAION-5。",
