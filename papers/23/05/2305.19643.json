    "translated_abstract": "在异常检测中引入扩散模型为病理图像的更有效和准确的重建铺平了道路。然而，当前通过调节噪声粒度来控制模型的通用性存在局限性，并妨碍了对健康组织的恢复。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出了AutoDDPM，一种增强扩散模型鲁棒性的新方法。AutoDDPM利用扩散模型生成潜在异常的初始可能性地图，并将其与原始图像无缝集成。通过联合噪声分布重新采样，AutoDDPM实现了协调和修补效果。我们的研究证明了AutoDDPM的有效性，在保留健康组织的情况下替换异常区域，明显超越了扩散模型的局限性。它还为当前扩散模型的局限性提供了有价值的见解和分析，促进了鲁棒和普适的异常检测模型的发展。",
