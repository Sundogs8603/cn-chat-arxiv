    "translated_abstract": "在许多实际应用中，训练数据可能包含不正确或已损坏的标签，从噪声标签中学习是一个挑战。当使用带有噪声标签的语言模型进行微调时，模型很容易过度拟合标签噪声，导致性能下降。大多数现有的从噪声标签中学习的方法使用静态输入特征进行去噪，但这些方法受限于它们在真实标签分布方面提供的信息，可能导致有偏的或不正确的预测。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个名为DyGen的动态增强生成模型，该模型在语言模型的微调过程中利用嵌入空间中的动态模式来改善噪声标签预测。DyGen使用变分自动编码框架从噪声标签和训练动态中推断真实标签的后验分布。此外，使用共规正则化机制来最小化潜在噪声标签和先验的影响。在存在不同级别的标签噪声情况下，DyGen在两个大规模文本分类数据集上展示了最先进的性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "DyGen is a dynamics-enhanced generative model that improves the accuracy of learning from noisy labels by using dynamic patterns in the embedding space and minimizing the impact of potentially noisy labels and priors through co-regularization. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale text classification datasets in the presence of various levels of label noise."
