    "translated_abstract": "电力消耗预测方法是为了决策节能以及在能源市场中预测需求等多种原因而进行研究的。本研究旨在比较两种深度学习模型，即长短时记忆（LSTM）和双向LSTM（BLSTM），用于单变量电度量时间序列的短期预测。为了评估模型的鲁棒性，选择了四个不同上下文和规模的数据集。这些四个数据集分别是：（a）法国家庭的用电量；（b）巴西Santaém的一座大学建筑的用电量；（c）摩洛哥Tétouan市的用电需求；（d）新加坡聚合电力需求。采用时间序列交叉验证方案计算了RMSE、MAE、MAPE和R2等指标。对归一化RMSE（NRMSE）的结果应用了Friedman检验，表明BLSTM比LSTM表现更好并且具有统计显著性。",
