    "translated_abstract": "深度对冲是一种在存在市场摩擦的情况下对冲衍生品的框架。本研究重点研究了使用多个期权对给定目标期权进行对冲的问题。为了将深度对冲框架扩展到此设置，作为对冲工具的期权也必须在培训期间定价。虽然可以使用传统的价格模型（如Black-Scholes公式），但忽略摩擦会提供不希望看到的套利机会，这对深度对冲学习是不利的。本研究的目标是开发一种嵌套深度对冲方法。也就是说，我们开发了一种深度对冲的完全深度方法，在此方法中，对冲工具的定价也由深度神经网络进行定价，该网络能了解到市场摩擦。然而，由于必须在许多不同的条件下计算对冲工具的价格，整个学习过程可能会计算上无法处理。为了克服这个问题，我们提出了一种嵌套深度对冲的高效学习方法。",
