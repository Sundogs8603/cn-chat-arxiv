    "abstract": "In this paper, we have shown a script conversion (transliteration) technique that converts Sindhi text in the Devanagari script to the Perso-Arabic script. We showed this by incorporating a hybrid approach where some part of the text is converted using a rule base and in case an ambiguity arises then a probabilistic model is used to resolve the same. Using this approach, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 99.64%.",
