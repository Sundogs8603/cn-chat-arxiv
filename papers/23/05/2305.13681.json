    "translated_abstract": "由于试错的性质，将RL算法应用于安全关键的现实应用（例如自动驾驶、人机交互、机器人操作等）通常是具有挑战性的，因为这些错误是不可容忍的。最近，安全RL（即约束RL）已经在文献中迅速出现，其中代理在满足约束条件的同时，探索环境。由于算法和任务的多样性，比较现有的安全RL算法仍然很困难。为了填补这一空白，我们介绍了GUARD，一个广义统一安全强化学习开发基准测试平台。与现有基准相比，GUARD具有几个优点。首先，GUARD是一个广义基准测试平台，具有各种RL代理、任务和安全约束规范。其次，GUARD全面涵盖了最先进的安全RL算法，并具有自包含的实现。第三，GUARD在任务和算法方面具有高度的可自定义性。我们提供了状态下现有方法在GUARD上的基准测试结果。",
