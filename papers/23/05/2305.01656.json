    "abstract": "We present a study using new computational methods, based on a novel combination of machine learning for inferring admixture hidden Markov models and probabilistic model checking, to uncover interaction styles in a mobile app. These styles are then used to inform a redesign, which is implemented, deployed, and then analysed using the same methods. The data sets are logged user traces, collected over two six-month deployments of each version, involving thousands of users and segmented into different time intervals. The methods do not assume tasks or absolute metrics such as measures of engagement, but uncover the styles through unsupervised inference of clusters and analysis with probabilistic temporal logic. For both versions there was a clear distinction between the styles adopted by users during the first day/week/month of usage, and during the second and third months, a result we had not anticipated.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出一种新的计算方法，基于机器学习推断混合隐马尔科夫模型和概率模型检验，用于揭示移动应用程序中的交互风格。这些风格用于重新设计应用程序，并使用相同的方法实施，部署，然后进行分析。这些数据集是用户痕迹记录，分别在两个版本的六个月部署期间收集，并分为不同的时间间隔。这些方法不针对任务或绝对指标（如参与度的度量），而是通过无监督的聚类推断和概率时间逻辑分析来揭示风格。对于两个版本，用户在使用的第一天/第一周/第一个月和第二个第三个月期间采用的风格有明显的区别，这是我们没有预料到的结果。",
