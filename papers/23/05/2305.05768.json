    "translated_abstract": "现代人脸识别（FR）模型在受控情境下表现出色，但在部署到未受控制的（现实世界的）环境中时，往往由于关于捕获面部数据质量的不确定性而导致性能下降。人脸图像质量评估（FIQA）技术旨在通过提供样本质量预测来缓解这些性能降级，这些预测可用于拒绝低质量样本并减少误匹配错误。然而，尽管不断取得改进，但确保在具有多样化特征的面部图像中可靠地估计质量仍然具有挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为DifFIQA的新型FIQA方法，它依赖于去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）并确保高度竞争的结果。该方法的主要思想是利用DDPM的前向和后向过程来扰动面部图像，并量化这些扰动对应的图像嵌入的影响以进行质量评估。",
