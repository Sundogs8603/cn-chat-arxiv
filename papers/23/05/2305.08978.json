    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest social media activity can function as a proxy for measures of state-level public health, detectable through natural language processing. We present results of our efforts to apply this approach to estimate homelessness at the state level throughout the US during the period 2010-2019 and 2022 using a dataset of roughly 1 million geotagged tweets containing the substring ``homeless.'' Correlations between homelessness-related tweet counts and ranked per capita homelessness volume, but not general-population densities, suggest a relationship between the likelihood of Twitter users to personally encounter or observe homelessness in their everyday lives and their likelihood to communicate about it online. An increase to the log-odds of ``homeless'' appearing in an English-language tweet, as well as an acceleration in the increase in average tweet sentiment, suggest that tweets about homelessness are also affected by trends at the nation-scale.

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，社交媒体活动可以作为自然语言处理检测的州级公共卫生措施的代理。我们介绍了我们在2010-2019年和2022年期间使用大约100万个包含子字符串“homeless”的地理标记推文的数据集来估计整个美国州级别的无家可归人口的努力成果。无家可归人士相关的推文计数和按人均无家可归数量排名的相关性表明，在日常生活中遇到或观察到无家可归人士的可能性与用户在线上交流的可能性之间存在关系。英语推文中“homeless”出现的log-odds增加以及平均推文情感增长加速表明有关无家可归人士的推文也受到全国范围内的趋势影响。此外，对数据集的权衡、空间权衡以及与其他来源的比较说明了在此问题上类型II错误概率的作用。",

    "en_tdlr": "By analyzing the correlation between the number of tweets about homelessness and the per capita homelessness volume at the state level, we can estimate the homeless population in each state of the US, and the likelihood of the word \"homeless\" appearing in English tweets and the acceleration of the average tweet sentiment growth rate can also reflect national trends."
