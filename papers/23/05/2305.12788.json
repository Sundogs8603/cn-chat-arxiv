    "translated_abstract": "临床预测模型通常依赖于患者的电子健康记录(EHR)，但将医学知识整合到预测和决策中以提高效果具有挑战性。这是因为个性化预测需要个性化的知识图谱(KG)，而从患者EHR数据中生成个性化知识图谱很困难。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个名为\\textsc{GraphCare}的开放式框架，它使用外部知识图谱来改进基于EHR的预测。我们的方法从大规模语言模型(LLM)和外部生物医学知识图谱中提取知识，构建个体化的患者知识图谱，然后使用我们提出的Bi-attention AugmenTed (BAT)图神经网络(GNN)进行医疗预测训练。在两个公共数据集MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV上，\\textsc{GraphCare}在四个关键的医疗预测任务上均超过了基准线：死亡率、再入院率、住院天数和药物推荐。在MIMIC-III上，它将AUROC提高了17.6%和6.6%，将F1得分提高了7.9%。",
