    "translated_abstract": "近年来，生成人工智能在全球范围内引起了广泛关注。生成人工智能的其中一个应用——深度伪造，是一种合成视频。但是，深度伪造的负面应用——虚假新闻和色情内容，却成为了数字生态系统中最流行的两种形式。人们已经开始思考在电影制作、教学等领域中使用深度伪造的优势应用。然而，对于残疾人士中的深度伪造技术潜力的研究却非常少或根本没有。本文探讨了深度伪造作为一项辅助技术的潜力。我们调查了有关 Nvdia 新的视频会议功能的 Reddit 交流，该功能允许参与者在在线会议期间保持目光接触。通过手动网页抓取和定性编码，我们发现了 162 条相关评论，讨论了这项技术对于自闭症人士的相关性和适用性。",
