    "abstract": "Citation recommendation (CR) models may help authors find relevant articles at various stages of the paper writing process. Most research has dealt with either global CR, which produces general recommendations suitable for the initial writing stage, or local CR, which produces specific recommendations more fitting for the final writing stages. We propose the task of paragraph-level CR as a middle ground between the two approaches, where the paragraph's topic sentence is taken as input and recommendations for citing within the paragraph are produced at the output. We propose a model for this task, fine-tune it using the quadruplet loss on the dataset of ACL papers, and show improvements over the baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "引用建议(CR)模型可帮助作者在论文写作过程中的各个阶段找到相关文章。大多数研究处理全局CR，该全局CR适用于初始写作阶段的一般建议。本研究提出了段落级CR任务，作为两种方法之间的一种中间地带，其中段落的主题句作为输入，生成段落内引用的建议作为输出。我们提出了一个模型来解决这个任务，并使用ACL论文数据集上的四元组损失进行了微调，结果显示相对于基线有所改善。",
