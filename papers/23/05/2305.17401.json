    "translated_abstract": "随着互联网的广泛使用，高效地从大量学术论文中提取特定信息变得越来越重要。数据挖掘技术通常用于解决这个问题。然而，挖掘学术论文的数据具有挑战性，因为它需要自动从复杂的非结构化布局文档中提取特定模式。当前的学术论文数据挖掘方法使用基于规则的（RB）或机器学习（ML）方法。然而，使用基于规则的方法需要编写复杂排版论文的高昂成本。另一方面，仅使用机器学习方法需要对文章中复杂内容类型进行注释工作，这可能成本高昂。此外，仅使用机器学习可能会导致基于规则的方法容易识别的模式被错误提取的情况。为了解决这些问题，本文从分析指定著作中使用的标准布局和排版角度出发，提出了一种结合基于规则的方法和机器学习的框架。",
