    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种时间分层架构（TLA），用于具有最小能量消耗的时间自适应控制。TLA将快速策略和慢速策略层叠在一起，实现时间抽象，使每个层可以专注于不同的时间尺度。我们的设计借鉴了人脑的节能机制，根据环境需求在不同的时间尺度上执行动作。我们证明了TLA除了节能之外，还提供了许多额外的优势，包括持续探索、减少需求决策、减少抖动和增加动作重复。我们在一系列连续控制任务上评估了我们的方法，并展示了TLA在多个重要指标上相对于现有方法的显著优势。我们还引入了多目标评分来定性评估连续控制策略，并展示了TLA具有显著更好的评分。我们的训练算法在慢速策略和",
