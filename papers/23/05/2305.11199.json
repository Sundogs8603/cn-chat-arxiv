Logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, and Shapley values were used to identify key predictors for PE and death.

    "translated_abstract": "截至2022年9月，全球已报告超过6亿多例SARS-CoV-2感染，造成超过650万人死亡。然而，COVID-19死亡风险估计器通常是基于小型不具代表性的样本以及方法学限制而开发的。开发COVID-19患者肺栓塞的预测工具是非常重要的。本研究利用国际队列超过80万COVID-19患者的数据集，提出一种成本敏感的梯度提升机器学习模型，用于预测入院时的PE事件和死亡风险。采用逻辑回归、Cox比例风险模型和Shapley值等方法，识别PE和死亡的关键预测因子。我们的预测模型在高度多样化的测试集上的测试AUROC分别为75.9％和74.2％，并且在PE和所有原因的死亡方面的敏感性分别为67.5％和72.7％。PE预测模型还在接受血栓预防治疗的患者子群中进行了评估，表现优于现有的PE风险评分系统。本研究提供了一种新颖且准确的工具，可用于在入院时预测COVID-19患者的死亡率和PE, 有助于早期识别和管理高危患者。",
