    "abstract": "The article presents the torchosr package - a Python package compatible with PyTorch library - offering tools and methods dedicated to Open Set Recognition in Deep Neural Networks. The package offers two state-of-the-art methods in the field, a set of functions for handling base sets and generation of derived sets for the Open Set Recognition task (where some classes are considered unknown and used only in the testing process) and additional tools to handle datasets and methods. The main goal of the package proposal is to simplify and promote the correct experimental evaluation, where experiments are carried out on a large number of derivative sets with various Openness and class-to-category assignments. The authors hope that state-of-the-art methods available in the package will become a source of a correct and open-source implementation of the relevant solutions in the domain.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了torchosr包--一个与PyTorch库兼容的Python包，提供了专为深度神经网络中的Open Set Recognition设计的工具和方法。该软件包提供了两种最新的Open Set Recognition方法，一组处理基础集并生成用于Open Set Recognition任务的派生集的函数（其中一些类在测试过程中被认为是未知的并仅使用），以及用于处理数据集和方法的其他工具。该软件包提议的主要目标是简化和推广正确的实验评估，其中实验在大量具有不同Openness和类别分配的派生集上进行。作者希望，在软件包中提供的最先进的方法将成为所述领域相关解决方案的正确和开源实现的来源。",
