    "translated_abstract": "许多实际问题可以理解为寻找一种状态，它扩展了固定的部分状态，即\"环境\"，同时满足一定的形式化规定条件。这类问题在工程、法律或经济学中都存在。本文研究了这一类问题，其中，用户在搜索开始时并不知道有关环境的某些信息。在搜索过程中，用户可以考虑某些暂定解决方案，这些方案对这些未知信息进行了暗示性假设。为确保解决方案的适宜性，这些假设必须通过对环境的观察来进行验证。此外，我们还假设，除了解决方案构成的知识外，我们还有关于环境通用定律的知识。我们正式定义了具有足够验证事实的部分解决方案，以保证完整、适当解决方案的存在性。另外，我们提出了一个交互式系统，以协助用户进行搜索过程，系统根据用户行动的观察结果提出和完善解决方案的假设。",
