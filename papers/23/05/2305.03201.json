    "abstract": "Text classification has become a crucial task in various fields, leading to a significant amount of research on developing automated text classification systems for national and international languages. However, there is a growing need for automated text classification systems that can handle local languages. This study aims to establish an automated classification system for Pashto text. To achieve this goal, we constructed a dataset of Pashto documents and applied various models, including statistical and neural machine learning models such as DistilBERT-base-multilingual-cased, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbor, decision tree, Gaussian na\\\"ive Bayes, multinomial na\\\"ive Bayes, random forest, and logistic regression, to identify the most effective approach. We also evaluated two different feature extraction methods, bag of words and Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency. The study achieved an average testing accuracy rate of 94% using the MLP class",

    "translated_abstract": "文本分类已成为各个领域中至关重要的任务，导致了大量研究开发自动化文本分类系统以支持国内外的语言。然而，需要自动化文本分类系统来处理本地语言的需求越来越大。本研究旨在建立一个普什图语文本的自动分类系统。为了实现这一目标，我们构建了一个普什图语文档数据集，并应用了各种模型，包括统计和神经机器学习模型，如DistilBERT-base-multilingual-cased、多层感知器、支持向量机、K最近邻、决策树、高斯朴素贝叶斯、多项式朴素贝叶斯、随机森林和逻辑回归，来确定最有效的方法。我们还评估了两种不同的特征提取方法，即词袋和词频逆向文档频率。研究表明，使用多层感知器分类器，测试准确率平均值达到了94％。",
