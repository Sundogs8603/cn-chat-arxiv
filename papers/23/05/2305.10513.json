    "abstract": "This paper investigates the challenge of learning image manifolds, specifically pose manifolds, of 3D objects using limited training data. It proposes a DNN approach to manifold learning and for predicting images of objects for novel, continuous 3D rotations. The approach uses two distinct concepts: (1) Geometric Style-GAN (Geom-SGAN), which maps images to low-dimensional latent representations and maintains the (first-order) manifold geometry. That is, it seeks to preserve the pairwise distances between base points and their tangent spaces, and (2) uses Euler's elastica to smoothly interpolate between directed points (points + tangent directions) in the low-dimensional latent space. When mapped back to the larger image space, the resulting interpolations resemble videos of rotating objects. Extensive experiments establish the superiority of this framework in learning paths on rotation manifolds, both visually and quantitatively, relative to state-of-the-art GANs and VAEs.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了使用有限的训练数据学习3D对象的图像流形，特别是姿态流形的挑战。它提出了一种DNN方法来学习流形，并预测新颖的连续3D旋转对象的图像。该方法使用两个不同的概念：（1）几何样式 GAN（Geom-SGAN），它将图像映射到低维潜在表示并保持（一阶）流形几何。即，它试图保持基本点及其切空间之间的成对距离，（2）使用 Euler 的弹性体在低维潜在空间中平滑地插值于有向点（点+切向量）。当映射回更大的图像空间时，所得到的插值类似于旋转物体的影片。广泛的实验表明，与最先进的GAN和VAE相比，这种框架在学习旋转流形路径方面具有更好的视觉效果和定量结果。",
