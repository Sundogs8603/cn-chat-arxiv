    "abstract": "Recent advancements in generative modeling have made it possible to generate high-quality content from context information, but a key question remains: how to teach models to know when to generate content? To answer this question, this study proposes a novel event generative model that draws its statistical intuition from marked temporal point processes, and offers a clean, flexible, and computationally efficient solution for a wide range of applications involving multi-dimensional marks. We aim to capture the distribution of the point process without explicitly specifying the conditional intensity or probability density. Instead, we use a conditional generator that takes the history of events as input and generates the high-quality subsequent event that is likely to occur given the prior observations. The proposed framework offers a host of benefits, including exceptional efficiency in learning the model and generating samples, as well as considerable representational power to capture",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，生成建模的进步使得从上下文信息中生成高质量内容成为可能，但一个关键问题仍然存在：如何教模型知道何时生成内容？为了回答这个问题，本研究提出了一种新的事件生成模型，从标记时间点过程中提取其统计直觉，并提供了一个干净、灵活和计算效率高的解决方案，适用于涉及多维标记的各种应用。我们旨在捕捉点过程的分布而不需明确指定条件强度或概率密度。我们使用一个条件生成器，以事件历史为输入并生成在先前观察到的事件下，可能发生的高质量随后事件。所提出的框架提供了一系列利益，包括在学习模型和生成样本方面的异常效率以及相当大的表示能力来捕捉。",
