    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method to achieve healthcare data democratization and information leakage prevention through irreversible data encoding. The desired encoding framework is achieved by using random projections and random quantum encoding for dense and longitudinal or time-series data, which allows for effective extraction based on the information bottleneck principle while preserving the semantics of the original data. This provides a new approach for the development of deep learning-based healthcare solutions."
