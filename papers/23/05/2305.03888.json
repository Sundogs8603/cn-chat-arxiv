    "translated_abstract": "近年来，设备上的深度学习因其开发移动设备上的经济实惠深度学习应用而备受关注。然而，设备上的模型受到有限的能量和计算资源的约束。同时，一种名为Sponge毒化的攻击方式已经被开发出来。这种攻击方式涉及到提供毒害样本给模型，以增加推断期间的能量消耗。由于先前的工作侧重于服务器硬件加速器，因此在本文中，我们将Sponge毒化攻击扩展到设备上的情况，以评估移动设备处理器的安全性。我们提出了一个设备上的Sponge毒化攻击流程，以模拟流式和一致的推断场景，以填补设备上设置中的知识差距。我们在处理器和设备网络方面进行了独家实验分析，结果显示Sponge毒化攻击可以有效污染具有内置加速器的现代处理器。我们分析了在设备上进行神经网络毒化攻击的能量和延迟成本。",
