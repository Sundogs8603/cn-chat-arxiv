    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于模型的时间序列聚类新方法。该方法依赖于两个迭代步骤：（i）通过考虑每个簇所涉及的时序，并由 pooling（集中）拟合 K 个全局预测模型；（ii）每个序列被分配到产生最佳预测的模型关联的组。与文献中大多数技术不同，该方法将预测准确性作为构建聚类分区的主要元素，其中包含共同最小化总体预测误差的组。因此，该方法导致了一个新的聚类范式，其中聚类解的质量是通过其预测能力来衡量的。此外，该过程还引起了在时间序列数据库中选择聚类数的有效机制，并且可以与任何回归模型类结合使用。广泛的模拟研究表明，该方法是要比传统方法更加好的选择。",
