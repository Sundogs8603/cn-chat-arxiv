    "translated_abstract": "基于扩散的生成模型通过创造逼真的图像而获得了全球关注。然而，它们复杂的内部结构和操作往往使得非专业人员难以理解。我们提出了 Diffusion Explainer，这是第一个交互式可视化工具，用于解释稳定扩散如何将文本提示转化为图像。Diffusion Explainer紧密地将稳定扩散的复杂组件的视觉概述与其潜在操作的详细说明相结合，通过动画和交互元素使用户可以流畅地在多个抽象级别之间过渡。通过比较由两个相关文本提示引导的图像表示的演变来指导精细时间步长，用户可以发现提示对图像生成的影响。Diffusion Explainer在用户的Web浏览器中本地运行，无需安装或专门的硬件，扩大了公众对现代人工智能技术的教育获取。",
