    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the reliable and safe deployment of machine learning systems in the real world. Great progress has been made over the past years. This paper presents the first review of recent advances in OOD detection with a particular focus on natural language processing approaches. First, we provide a formal definition of OOD detection and discuss several related fields. We then categorize recent algorithms into three classes according to the data they used: (1) OOD data available, (2) OOD data unavailable + in-distribution (ID) label available, and (3) OOD data unavailable + ID label unavailable. Third, we introduce datasets, applications, and metrics. Finally, we summarize existing work and present potential future research topics.",

    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界中，基于外部分布（OOD）的检测对于机器学习系统的可靠和安全的部署至关重要。过去几年取得了极大进展。本文重点关注自然语言处理方法，并首次综述了OOD检测方面的最新进展。首先，我们给出OOD检测的正式定义，并讨论了几个相关领域。然后，根据算法使用的数据，将最近的算法分成三类：（1）可用OOD数据，（2）OOD数据不可用+内部分布（ID）标签可用，（3）OOD数据不可用+ID标签不可用。第三，介绍数据集、应用和度量方法。最后，总结现有工作并提出潜在的未来研究课题。",
