    "translated_abstract": "为了使机器人能够通用，我们需要让机器人像人类一样操作日常使用的关节物品。目前，机器人操纵大量依赖于使用平行夹具，这使得机器人局限于一些物体的操作。而使用多指机器人手将更好地近似人类行为，并使机器人在多样化的关节物体上进行操作。为此，我们提出了一个新的基准测试称为 DexArt，它涉及使用物理模拟器进行关节物体的灵巧操作。在我们的基准测试中，我们定义了多个复杂的操作任务，机器人手需要在每个任务中操作多样化的关节物体。我们的主要重点是评估在未见过的关节物体上学习到的策略的泛化能力。考虑到手和物体的自由度很高，这非常具有挑战性。我们使用强化学习和三维表示学习来实现泛化。通过实验，我们证明了我们的方法在未见过的关节物体上具有很好的泛化性。",
