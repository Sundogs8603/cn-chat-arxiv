    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了有限状态不想静止多臂赌博机问题。决策者可以在每个时间步骤中选择M个臂中的任意一个，臂的播放产生基于动作的状态相关奖励，当臂没有被播放时，它还提供基于状态和动作的奖励。决策者的目标是最大化无限时间长度的折扣奖励。传统的不想静止赌博机方法是使用 Whittle 索引策略。在这种策略中，每个时间步骤播放具有最高指数的M个臂。我们将不想静止赌博机问题分离成分析松弛约束不想静止赌博机问题。然后通过拉格朗日松弛问题，将不想静止赌博机问题分离成N个单臂不想静止赌博机问题。我们分析了单臂不想静止赌博机。为了研究 Whittle 索引策略，我们在单臂赌博机模型上展示了结构结果。我们定义了可索引性，并在特定情况下展示了可索引性。我们提出了一种应用rollout策略的算法来解决问题。",
