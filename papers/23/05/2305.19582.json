    "translated_abstract": "在许多科学领域中，具有潜在混淆因素的因果关系发现是一项重要但具有挑战性的任务。尽管某些过完备独立分量分析（OICA）方法在某些领域取得了成功，但它们计算成本高，容易陷入局部最优解。我们发现有趣的是，通过利用高阶累积量，在特定情况下（例如，混合过程遵循单潜在分量结构），存在OICA的闭合形式解决方案。鉴于OICA闭合形式解决方案与单潜在成分结构相对应的强大功能，我们制定了一种使用高阶累积量估计混合矩阵的方法，并进一步提出可测试的单潜在成分条件，以识别潜在变量并确定因果顺序。通过迭代删除共享识别的潜在成分，我们成功地将单潜在成分结构的结果扩展到多潜在成分结构。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel approach for causal discovery with latent confounders by using higher-order cumulants, which provides closed-form solution to OICA problem in the One-Latent-Component structure. The paper also suggests a testable condition for identifying latent variables and determining causal orders, and successfully extends the results to Multi-Latent-Component structure by iteratively removing shared identified latent components."
