    "translated_abstract": "多元时间序列插补是近年来广泛研究的问题。现有方法可以分为两大类，包括（1）主要关注时间序列特征的深度递归或生成模型，以及（2）基于图神经网络（GNN）的模型，利用MTS固有图结构的拓扑信息作为插补的关系归纳偏差。然而，这些方法要么忽略了拓扑信息，要么假定图结构固定且准确已知。因此，在更具挑战性的网络时间序列（NTS）数据中，它们无法充分利用图动态进行精确的插补，其中底层图不断变化并可能存在缺失边。本文提出了一种新方法来克服这些限制。首先，我们定义了包含节点时间序列特征和图结构中缺失值的NTS插补问题。然后，我们设计了一种名为PGE-VAE的新模型，它利用定位编码技术将时间序列信息合并到图神经网络中。具体而言，我们建议使用自我注意机制来捕捉图中不同时间步骤和不同节点之间的依赖关系。此外，我们引入了一个动态图生成网络来学习图结构的演化，可以处理缺失的边并适应图动态。在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，我们提出的方法优于现有最先进的方法。",
