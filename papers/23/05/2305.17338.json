    "translated_abstract": "今天，船体检测，包括外部涂层的检查，缺陷的检测以及其他类型的外部降解如腐蚀和海洋生长通过远程操作车（ROVs）在水下进行。检测过程包括对视频的手动分析，这是一个耗时且劳动密集的过程。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种使用深度学习和计算机视觉的自动化视频分析系统，以改进现有方法所仅考虑水下船体视频检测单个帧的空间信息的不足。通过探索添加时间信息和分析基于帧的分类器的优势，我们提出了一种多标签视频分类模型，利用变换器的自我注意机制来捕获连续视频帧中的时空注意。我们的提出的方法已经展现出有前途的结果，并可作为未来水下船体检验研究和发展的基准。",
