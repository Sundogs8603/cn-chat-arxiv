    "translated_abstract": "辅助人类的机器人需要与关节物体（例如橱柜或微波炉）交互。早期研究使用本体感知来在接触过程中估计关节机制。但是，现在几乎所有系统在接触过程中仅使用视觉而不再考虑本体感知信息。我们认为，在接触过程中使用本体感知信息是有价值的信息来源，并且在文献中没有明确的不使用它的动机。因此，在本文中，我们创建了一个系统，从给定的握取开始，使用本体感知来控制位置和平行夹持器打开橱柜。我们进行了定性评估，发现夹持器和把手之间的滑动限制了系统的性能。尽管如此，我们发现该系统已经表现得非常好。这引出了一个问题：我们是否应该更多地利用关节物体操作中的本体感知信息？",
