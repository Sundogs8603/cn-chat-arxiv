    "translated_abstract": "强化学习最近在机器人控制方面取得了显著的成功。但是，多数强化学习方法在模拟环境中运行，那里的特权知识（例如动力学，环境，地形）是轻松获取的。相反，在真实场景中，机器人代理通常仅依赖于本地状态（例如机器人关节的本体感反馈）来选择动作，导致显著的模拟到真实的差距。现有方法通过逐渐减少对特权知识的依赖或执行两阶段策略模仿来解决这个差距。但我们认为，这些方法在充分利用特权知识的能力方面存在局限性，导致性能次优。本文提出了一种称为历史信息瓶颈（HIB）的新型单阶段特权知识蒸馏方法，以缩小模拟到真实的差距。具体而言，HIB通过捕捉历史轨迹的特权知识表示来学习。",
