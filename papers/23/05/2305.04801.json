    "translated_abstract": "找到投资组合的对冲比率和风险压缩是同样的数学问题。传统上，这个问题使用回归解决。但是，回归有自己的局限性。在回归模型中，由于多重共线性问题和结果的不稳定性，我们无法使用高度相关的独立变量。回归模型也不能考虑对冲成本在对冲比率估计中的影响。我们提出了几种方法，解决了线性回归的限制，并实现了更好的性能。这些模型一般分为两类：正则技术和常因素分析。在正则技术中，我们最小化对冲组合损益（PnL）和对冲比率大小的方差，有助于降低对冲成本。正则技术方法也可以将对冲成本视为资金成本、市场状况和流动性成本的函数考虑。在常因素分析中，我们使用一些公共因素来捕捉股票收益率之间的共同变化。",
