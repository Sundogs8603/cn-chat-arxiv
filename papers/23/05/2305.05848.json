    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统是各个领域，例如电子商务、电子学习和流媒体等中不可或缺的部分。目前，用于会话推荐的图神经网络通常只能推荐用户历史会话中已存在的项目。因此这些图神经网络在推荐用户从未与之交互的项目（新产品）时面临信息封闭的问题。因此，有必要向用户推荐新的产品。由于新产品与用户之间没有交互，因此在构建基于图神经网络的会话推荐系统时，我们不能将新产品包括在会话图中。因此，使用基于GNN（图神经网络）的方法向用户推荐新产品具有挑战性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种双意图增强图神经网络。由于新的产品与历史会话没有绑定关系，模型学习如何捕捉用户和项目的意图。具体而言，我们的模型引入了双意图图神经网络，一张图来捕获项目意图的表示，另一张图来捕获用户意图的表示。该模型将历史会话与用户和项目双重意图表示相结合，用于推荐。两个真实数据集上的实验结果证明了我们提出的方法的有效性。",
