    "abstract": "To solve the problem of poor performance of deep neural network models due to insufficient data, a simple yet effective interpolation-based data augmentation method is proposed: MSMix (Manifold Swap Mixup). This method feeds two different samples to the same deep neural network model, and then randomly select a specific layer and partially replace hidden features at that layer of one of the samples by the counterpart of the other. The mixed hidden features are fed to the model and go through the rest of the network. Two different selection strategies are also proposed to obtain richer hidden representation. Experiments are conducted on three Chinese intention recognition datasets, and the results show that the MSMix method achieves better results than other methods in both full-sample and small-sample configurations.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了解决深度神经网络模型由于数据不足而表现不佳的问题，提出了一种简单而有效的基于插值的数据增强方法：MSMix(流形交换Mixup)。该方法将两个不同的样本输入同一个深度神经网络模型，随机选择一个特定的层，部分替换该层一个样本的隐藏特征为另一个样本的对应特征。混合后的隐藏特征输入模型，并通过网络的其余部分。还提出了两种不同的选择策略，以获取更丰富的隐藏表示。在三个中文意图识别数据集上进行了实验，结果表明MSMix方法在完整样本和小样本配置下均获得了比其他方法更好的结果。",
