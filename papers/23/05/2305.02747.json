Previous DTS methods either focus on semantic similarity or dialogue coherence to assess topic similarity for unsupervised dialogue segmentation.

    "translated_abstract": "对话主题分割在各种对话建模任务中起着重要作用。现有的DTS方法要么关注语义相似性，要么关注对话连贯性来评估主题相似性以进行无监督对话分割。但主题相似性不能通过语义相似性或对话连贯性的方式来完全识别。此外，未标记的对话数据中包含有用的话语关系提示，但这些提示未被充分利用。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的无监督DTS框架，通过邻近话语匹配和伪分割从未标记的对话数据中学习主题感知的话语表示。在两个基准数据集（DialSeg711和Doc2Dial）上的广泛实验表明，我们的方法显著优于强基准方法。为了可复现性，我们在https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/dial-start上提供了我们的代码和数据。",
