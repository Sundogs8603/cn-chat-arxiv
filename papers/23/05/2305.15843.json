    "abstract": "This work presents a novel approach to tabular data prediction leveraging graph structure learning and graph neural networks. Despite the prevalence of tabular data in real-world applications, traditional deep learning methods often overlook the potentially valuable associations between data instances. Such associations can offer beneficial insights for classification tasks, as instances may exhibit similar patterns of correlations among features and target labels. This information can be exploited by graph neural networks, necessitating robust graph structures. However, existing studies primarily focus on improving graph structure from noisy data, largely neglecting the possibility of deriving graph structures from tabular data. We present a novel solution, Tabular Graph Structure Learning (TabGSL), to enhance tabular data prediction by simultaneously learning instance correlation and feature interaction within a unified framework. This is achieved through a proposed graph contrastive",
