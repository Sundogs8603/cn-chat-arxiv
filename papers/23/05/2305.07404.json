In this paper, we propose a new approach for facing the color normalization problem in HER2-stained histopathological images of breast cancer tissue, posed as an style transfer problem. We combine the Color Deconvolution technique with the Pix2Pix GAN network to present a novel approach to correct the color variations between different HER2 stain brands. Our approach focuses on maintaining the HER2 score of the cells in the transformed images, which is crucial for the HER2 analysis.

    "translated_abstract": "早期发现乳腺癌对改善患者预后至关重要。 Institut Català de la Salut（ICS）启动了DigiPatICS项目，以开发和实施人工智能算法来协助癌症的诊断。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法来解决乳腺癌组织中HER2染色病理学图像中的颜色规范化问题，该问题被表示为样式转移问题。我们将色彩去卷积技术与Pix2Pix GAN网络相结合，提出了一种纠正不同HER2品牌之间颜色变化的新方法。我们的方法侧重于保持变换后图像中细胞的HER2分数，这对于HER2分析至关重要。结果表明，我们的最终模型在保持变换后图像的细胞类别方面优于最先进的图像样式转移方法，并且在生成逼真图像方面与它们一样有效。",
