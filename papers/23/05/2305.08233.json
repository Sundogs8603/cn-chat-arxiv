    "translated_abstract": "本文针对图上的节点分类任务，通过完全训练的深度消息传递模型来学习节点表示的层次结构，通过多次聚合节点附近的邻居来实现。在展示高比例内类边缘的图形上有效，但在异质性相反的情况下，即属于同一类的节点通常相隔较远，这种方法面临挑战。在具有高度异质性的图形中，卷积模型计算的基于紧密邻居的平滑表示不再有效。目前，在消息传递模型中提出了体系结构变化以减少过度平滑或重新布线输入图以改善长程消息传递。本文通过使用图形回声状态网络(GESN)来解决异质性图形的挑战以进行节点分类。GESN是一种图形的储备计算模型，在该模型中，节点嵌入是通过未经训练的消息传递函数递归计算的。",
