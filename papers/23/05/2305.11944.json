    "translated_abstract": "查询-文档相关性预测是信息检索系统中的一个关键问题。这个问题越来越多地使用（预先训练的）基于转换器的模型来解决，这些模型使用大量标记数据进行微调。然而，在电子商务和医疗保健等专业领域，这种方法的可行性受到领域内大规模数据的匮乏限制。为了解决这个问题，最近的方法利用这些强大的模型生成高质量的特定任务和领域的合成数据。先前的工作主要探索了合成数据生成或用于问答和二元（是/否）相关性预测的查询生成（QGen）, 其中例如，QGen模型给出一个文档，并训练生成一个与该文档相关的查询。然而，在许多问题中，我们对相关性有一个更细粒度的概念，而不是一个简单的是/否标签。因此，在这项工作中，我们进行了详细的研究，探讨了如何利用QGen方法实现细微的相关性预测。具体而言，我们研究了使用合成查询来预测对文档的查询分级相关性的有效性，并探索使用无监督聚类技术进一步改进对数据中相关性模式的理解。",
