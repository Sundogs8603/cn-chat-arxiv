    "translated_abstract": "将大型语言模型与逻辑推理相结合可以增强它们在问题解决中的能力，使其更加强大和可靠。然而，逻辑推理的复杂性使得从网页上收集可靠的数据来建立全面的训练数据集面临困难，进而影响下游任务的性能。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的逻辑驱动数据增强方法，AMR-LDA。AMR-LDA将原始文本转换成抽象意义表示（AMR）图，这是一种结构化的语义表示，包含了句子的逻辑结构，然后对该图进行操作以生成逻辑修改后的AMR图。修改后的AMR图随后被转换回文本，从而创建增强数据。值得注意的是，我们的方法与体系结构无关，并通过提示增强来增强生成型大型语言模型（如GPT-3.5和GPT-4），并通过微调来增强判别型大型语言模型。",
