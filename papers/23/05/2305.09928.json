    "translated_abstract": "深度学习技术的使用减少了地质图的解释时间，并通过从数字露头模型自动派生地质图来理想地减少了解释者偏见。然而，由于地质图解释的主观性以及收集定量验证数据的困难，对这些自动化制图方法的准确验证是一项重大挑战。此外，许多最先进的深度学习方法仅限于2D图像数据，这对于诸如超级云这样的3D数字露头是不足够的。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了Tinto，这是一个多传感器数字露头基准测试数据集，旨在促进开发和验证地质制图的深度学习方法，特别是针对非结构化的3D数据如点云。Tinto包括两个互补的数据集：1）来自Corta Atalaya（西班牙）的真实数字露头模型，具有光谱属性和地面真实数据，以及2）使用潜在变量的合成数据集，以模拟真实数据的各种变化和不确定性。",
