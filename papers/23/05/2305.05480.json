We trained GPT-2 and Bert model with StateMorph for both Finnish and Russian, which is a morpheme segmenting algorithm. As a comparison, we also trained a model with BPE and Morfessor. Our preliminary result shows that StateMorph can help the model to converge more efficiently and achieve a better validation score.",
