    "abstract": "This paper evaluates market equilibrium under different pricing mechanisms in a two-settlement 100%-renewables electricity market. Given general probability distributions of renewable energy, we establish game-theoretical models to analyze equilibrium bidding strategies, market prices, and profits under uniform pricing (UP) and pay-as-bid pricing (PAB). We prove that UP can incentivize suppliers to withhold bidding quantities and lead to price spikes. PAB can reduce the market price, but it may lead to a mixed-strategy price equilibrium. Then, we present a regulated uniform pricing scheme (RUP) based on suppliers' marginal costs that include penalty costs for real-time deviations. We show that RUP can achieve lower yet positive prices and profits compared with PAB in a duopoly market, which approximates the least-cost system outcome. Simulations with synthetic and real data find that under PAB and RUP, higher uncertainty of renewables and real-time shortage penalty prices can increase ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文在一个双结算的100%可再生能源电力市场中，分别从统一定价和按标的出价机制两种定价机制出发，通过建立博弈论模型并考虑到可再生能源的概率分布条件下，分析了均衡投标策略、市场价格和供应商的利润。研究结果表明，统一定价机制会激励供应商减少投标量并导致价格飙升；按标的出价机制可以降低市场价格，但可能会导致混合策略的价格均衡。因此，本文提出了一种基于供应商边际成本的调节统一定价机制，包括惩罚实时偏差成本，研究结果表明，与按标的出价机制相比，该机制可以实现较低但仍为正的价格和利润，在双头寡占市场下相当于最低成本系统结果。通过对合成和真实数据的模拟研究发现，按标的出价和调节统一定价机制下，可再生能源的不确定性和实时缺口惩罚价格的增加均会增加市场价格。",
