    "translated_abstract": "随着深度学习在许多安全敏感领域中的部署，机器学习安全变得越来越重要。最近的研究表明，攻击者可以利用DRAM的RowHammer漏洞，以确定性和精确性地翻转深度神经网络(DNN)模型权重的位，从而影响推断准确性。现有的防御机制是基于软件的，例如重构权重需要昂贵的训练开销或性能下降。另一方面，基于通用硬件的受害者/攻击者重点防御机制会导致昂贵的硬件开销，并保留受害者和攻击者行之间的空间连接。在本文中，我们提出了第一种针对量化DNN量身定制的基于DRAM的受害者重点防御机制，称为DNN-Defender，利用了内存中交换的潜力以抵御有针对性的位翻转攻击。我们的结果表明，DNN-Defender可以提供高水平的保护。",
