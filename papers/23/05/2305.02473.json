We assume that the latent position vectors lie on an unknown one-dimensional curve and are coupled with a response covariate via a regression model. Using the geometry of the underlying latent position vectors, we propose a manifold learning and graph embedding technique to predict the response variable on out-of-sample nodes, and we establish convergence guarantees for these responses.
