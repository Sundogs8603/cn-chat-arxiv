    "abstract": "Causality defines the relationship between cause and effect. In multivariate time series field, this notion allows to characterize the links between several time series considering temporal lags. These phenomena are particularly important in medicine to analyze the effect of a drug for example, in manufacturing to detect the causes of an anomaly in a complex system or in social sciences... Most of the time, studying these complex systems is made through correlation only. But correlation can lead to spurious relationships. To circumvent this problem, we present in this paper a novel approach for discovering causality in time series data that combines a causal discovery algorithm with an information theoretic-based measure. Hence the proposed method allows inferring both linear and non-linear relationships and building the underlying causal graph. We evaluate the performance of our approach on several simulated data sets, showing promising results.",

    "translated_abstract": "因果关系定义了因果和效应之间的关系。在多变量时间序列领域，这个概念允许考虑时间滞后来表征多个时间序列之间的联系。这些现象在医学上分析药物效应、在制造业中检测复杂系统中异常情况的原因或在社会科学中特别重要......大多数情况下，研究这些复杂系统仅通过相关性来实现。但是，相关性可能导致虚假的关系。为了解决这个问题，我们在本文中提出了一种新的方法，将因果发现算法与基于信息论的度量结合起来，从而允许推断线性和非线性关系并构建潜在的因果图。我们在几个模拟数据集上评估了该方法的性能，显示出有希望的结果。",
