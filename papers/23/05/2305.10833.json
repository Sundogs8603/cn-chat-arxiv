    "abstract": "The domain of Botany is rich with metaphorical terms. Those terms play an important role in the description and identification of flowers and plants. However, the identification of such terms in discourse is an arduous task. This leads in some cases to committing errors during translation processes and lexicographic tasks. The process is even more challenging when it comes to machine translation, both in the cases of single-word terms and multi-word terms. One of the recent concerns of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and Machine Translation (MT) technologies is the automatic identification of metaphor-based words in discourse through Deep Learning (DL). In this study, we seek to fill this gap through the use of thirteen popular transformer based models, as well as ChatGPT, and we show that discriminative models perform better than GPT-3.5 model with our best performer reporting 92.2349% F1 score in metaphoric flower and plant names identification task.",

    "translated_abstract": "植物学领域充满了隐喻性术语，这些术语在描述和识别花和植物方面起着重要作用。但是，在对话中识别这些术语是一项艰巨的任务。在翻译过程和词典编纂任务中，这往往导致错误的发生。当涉及到单词和短语时，在机器翻译方面这个过程更具挑战性。自然语言处理（NLP）应用和机器翻译（MT）技术的最新关注点之一是通过深度学习（DL）自动识别对话中基于隐喻的单词。在本研究中，我们使用了十三种流行的变压器模型以及ChatGPT来填补这一空白，并且通过F1得分证明了鉴别模型优于GPT-3.5模型，我们最好的表现器在隐喻花卉和植物名称识别任务中报告了92.2349％的F1分数。",
