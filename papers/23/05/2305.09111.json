    "abstract": "The recent popularity of Wordle has revived interest in guessing games. We develop a general method for finding optimal strategies for guessing games while avoiding an exhaustive search. Our main contributions are several theorems that build towards a general theory to prove the optimality of a strategy for a guessing game. This work is developed to apply to any guessing game, but we use Wordle as an example to present concrete results.",
