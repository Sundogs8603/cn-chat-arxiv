    "translated_abstract": "镁合金因其生物相容性、可控腐蚀速率以及与自然骨骼在刚度和密度方面的相似性而成为暂时性生物植入物的有吸引力选择。然而，低的机械强度阻碍了它们作为心血管支架和骨替代品的使用。虽然可以进行合金工程，以实现所需的机械强度，但使用常规实验方法优化生物相容性镁合金的力学性能非常耗时和昂贵。因此，可以利用人工智能来简化合金设计流程并缩短所需时间。在本研究中，开发了一个机器学习模型，可预测生物相容性镁合金的屈服强度，$R^2$的准确度为91％。接下来，将预测模型用作遗传算法的适应度函数，以优化合金中元素的质量百分比，并在力学强度和生物相容性之间获得平衡。",
