Our method does not rely on likelihoods or simulations, making it well-suited to the function space setting. We provide both a theoretical framework for building such models and an empirical evaluation of our techniques.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种名为功能流匹配（Functional Flow Matching, FFM）的函数空间生成模型，该模型将最近引入的流匹配（Flow Matching）直接推广到无限维空间中进行。我们的方法首先定义了一组概率测度路径，在固定的高斯测度和数据分布之间进行插值，然后学习函数的底层空间上生成此测度路径的向量场。我们的方法不依赖于似然或模拟，因此非常适合函数空间的设置。我们不仅提供构建这种模型的理论框架，还对我们的技术进行了经验评估。通过对合成和真实世界基准数据集的实验，我们证明了我们提出的FFM方法优于最近提出的几种函数空间生成模型。",
