    "abstract": "This paper surveys the empirical literature of inflation targeting. The main findings from our review are the following: there is robust empirical evidence that larger and more developed countries are more likely to adopt the IT regime; the introduction of this regime is conditional on previous disinflation, greater exchange rate flexibility, central bank independence, and higher level of financial development; the empirical evidence has failed to provide convincing evidence that IT itself may serve as an effective tool for stabilizing inflation expectations and for reducing inflation persistence; the empirical research focused on advanced economies has failed to provide convincing evidence on the beneficial effects of IT on inflation performance, while there is some evidence that the gains from the IT regime may have been more prevalent in the emerging market economies; there is not convincing evidence that IT is associated with either higher output growth or lower output variability;",

    "translated_abstract": "本文综述了通货膨胀目标的实证文献。我们的主要发现是：有坚实的经验证据表明，规模更大、更发达的国家更有可能采用IT制度；这种制度的引入是有条件的，先前的紧缩、更高的汇率灵活性、中央银行独立性和更高的金融发展水平；实证证据未能提供令人信服的证据，表明IT本身可以作为稳定通货膨胀预期和减少通货膨胀持久性的有效工具；针对发达经济体的实证研究未能提供有力证据表明IT对通货膨胀表现的有益影响，而有一些证据表明IT制度的收益在新兴市场经济体中更为普遍；对于IT是否与更高的产出增长或更低的产出波动有关，尚缺乏令人信服的证据。",
