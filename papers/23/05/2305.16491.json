    "translated_abstract": "时间序列分析的惯例是先估计确定性、非平稳趋势和季节成分，然后学习残差随机、平稳成分。最近已经表明，在没有相关平稳成分的情况下，可以使用多元奇异谱分析（mSSA）准确地学习确定性非平稳成分；同时，在没有确定性非平稳成分的情况下，自回归（AR）平稳成分也可以轻松学习，例如通过普通最小二乘（OLS）。然而，尽管这种两个步骤的学习算法已经普遍存在，但关于同时涉及确定性和平稳成分的多阶段学习算法的理论支撑在文献中还没有解决。我们通过为一种自然的两阶段算法建立理论保证来解决这个开放性问题，其中首先应用mSSA来估计非平稳成分，尽管存在相关性平稳成分。",
