    "abstract": "This study extends the recently-developed LaCAM algorithm for multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF). LaCAM is a sub-optimal search-based algorithm that uses lazy successor generation to dramatically reduce the planning effort. We present two enhancements. First, we propose its anytime version, called LaCAM*, which eventually converges to optima, provided that solution costs are accumulated transition costs. Second, we improve the successor generation to quickly obtain initial solutions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate their utility. For instance, LaCAM* sub-optimally solved 99% of the instances retrieved from the MAPF benchmark, where the number of agents varied up to a thousand, within ten seconds on a standard desktop PC, while ensuring eventual convergence to optima; developing a new horizon of MAPF algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究扩展了最近开发的LaCAM算法，用于多智能体路径规划（MAPF）。LaCAM是一种次优的基于搜索的算法，使用懒惰的后继生成来大幅减少规划工作量。我们提出了两个增强功能。首先，我们提出其任何时期版本，称为LaCAM*，其最终收敛于最佳解，前提是解决方案成本是累积的转换成本。其次，我们改进了后继生成，以快速获得初始解。详尽的实验证明了它们的效用。例如，LaCAM*在标准桌面PC上，在确保最终收敛到最佳解的情况下，次优地解决了从MAPF基准检索的99％的实例，其中代理数量最高达1000个，用时不超过十秒;开发了新的MAPF算法视野。",
