    "translated_abstract": "在许多实际任务中，相关对象可以表示为与候选标签集相关联的多实例包，该集合包括一个真实的标签和多个误报标签。多实例部分标签学习（MIPL）是一种应对此类任务的学习范式，并已取得良好表现。现有的MIPL方法遵循实例空间范式，通过为每个实例分配袋子的扩充候选标签集并从实例级标签汇总包级标签。然而，该方案可能是次优的，因为忽视了全局的包级信息，并且包的预测标签对于负实例的预测非常敏感。在本文中，我们研究了一种将多实例包嵌入到单个向量表示的替代方案。因此，我们提出了一种直观的算法DEMIPL，即用于多实例部分标签学习的消岐注意嵌入。DEMIPL利用了一种消岐注意机制。",
