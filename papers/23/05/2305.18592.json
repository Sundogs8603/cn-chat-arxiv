    "translated_abstract": "许多研究都致力于使用深度学习方法基于12导联心电图（ECG）记录来诊断心脏疾病。这些研究通常使用特定的数据集，这些数据集在大小和参数方面都有所不同，如患者元数据、标注ECG的医生数量、用于ECG记录的设备类型、数据预处理技术等。众所周知，训练在一个ECG数据集上的高质量深度神经网络不一定在另一个数据集或临床设置中表现良好。在本文中，我们提出了一种方法，通过在各种数据集上训练神经网络并进一步对特定数据集进行微调，可以改善心脏疾病预测的质量。为了展示其适用性，我们在一个大型私人数据集TIS和一个相对较小的公共数据集PTB-XL上训练了不同的神经网络。我们证明，相较于仅在特定数据集上进行训练，通过在大型数据集上训练网络并进行特定数据集的微调，可以显著提高分类准确性。此外，我们还表明仅微调预训练网络的最后一层就足以实现高质量的结果。",
