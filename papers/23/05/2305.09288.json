    "translated_abstract": "时间序列分类(TSC)是一个广泛研究领域，可以解决多种实际问题并取得出色的结果。其中表现良好的一类方法是所谓的基于词典的技术。时间词典集合(TDE)是目前基于词典的TSC方法中最先进的方法。在许多TSC问题中，我们发现与时间序列相关的标签具有自然的排序特性，这种特性被称作序数性，可以利用它来提高方法的性能。处理序数时间序列的领域称为时间序数分类(TSOC)，目前尚未被充分开发利用。在本研究中，我们提出了TDE算法的序数适应版，称为序数TDE(O-TDE)。为此，使用18个TSOC问题的测试集进行了全面比较。实验结果表明，与其他四种现有的名义方法相比，基于序数的词典方法取得了显著改进。",
