    "abstract": "It has been commonly observed that a teacher model with superior performance does not necessarily result in a stronger student, highlighting a discrepancy between current teacher training practices and effective knowledge transfer. In order to enhance the guidance of the teacher training process, we introduce the concept of distillation influence to determine the impact of distillation from each training sample on the student's generalization ability. In this paper, we propose Learning Good Teacher Matters (LGTM), an efficient training technique for incorporating distillation influence into the teacher's learning process. By prioritizing samples that are likely to enhance the student's generalization ability, our LGTM outperforms 10 common knowledge distillation baselines on 6 text classification tasks in the GLUE benchmark.",

    "translated_abstract": "先前研究表明，能力超群的教师模型并不一定能够让学生水平得到提升，这凸显了当前教师培训实践和有效知识传授之间的不一致性。为了提高教师培训过程的指导效果，本文引入了蒸馏效应的概念，以确定每个训练样本对学生泛化能力的影响。我们提出了一种名为学好教师很重要（LGTM）的有效训练技术，以将蒸馏效应纳入教师的学习过程中。通过优先选择可能提升学生泛化能力的样本，我们的LGTM在GLUE基准测试的6个文本分类任务中优于10个常见的知识蒸馏基线算法。",
