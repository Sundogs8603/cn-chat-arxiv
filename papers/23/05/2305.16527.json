    "translated_abstract": "本文研究使用基于机器学习的估计器作为控制变量来减少蒙特卡罗采样方差的方法。具体来说，我们旨在揭示影响控制变量效率的关键因素。我们研究一个原型估计问题，涉及根据从（随机的）数值积分节点获取的观测值模拟Sobolev函数的矩。首先，我们为该问题建立了信息论下限。然后，我们研究了一个特定的数值积分规则，它采用非参数回归调整控制变量来降低蒙特卡罗模拟的方差。我们证明了这种数值积分规则可以改善蒙特卡罗速度，并在充分光滑的假设下实现Minimax最优速度。由于 Sobolev 嵌入定理，充分光滑的假设消除了罕见和极端事件的存在。最后，我们表明，在存在罕见和极端事件的情况下，回归调整控制变量可以帮助解决方差缩减问题。",
