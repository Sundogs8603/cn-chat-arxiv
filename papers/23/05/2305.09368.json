    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种无监督的序列到序列学习方法，用于自动评估多通道电阻抗血流动力学监测中心肺容积信号（CVS）的运动诱导可靠性降低。该方法试图解决现有学习型评估方法的缺点，例如需要手动注释运动影响以及缺乏在 CVS 随时间出现上下文变化的情况下实现运动引起异常的显式机制。通过利用长短时记忆和变分自编码器结构，编码器 - 解码器模型不仅被训练成自我重现 CVS 的输入序列，而且还被训练成以平行方式外推未来。通过这样做，模型可以捕捉到暂态 CVS 序列中存在的上下文知识，同时被规范化以探索整个时间序列的一般关系。根据实际和预测 CVS 之间的差异，检测出低质量的受运动影响的 CVS。多通道 EIT 基心血管监测的大规模数据集实验表明，该方法在运动引起的测量质量评估方法的竞争性能上具有竞争力。",
