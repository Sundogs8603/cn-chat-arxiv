Basketball activities lend themselves well for measurement by wrist-worn inertial sensors, and systems that are able to detect such sport-relevant activities could be used in applications toward game analysis, guided training, and personal physical activity tracking. The dataset was recorded for two teams from separate countries (USA and Germany) with a total of 24 players who wore an inertial sensor on their wrist, during both repetitive basketball training sessions and full games. Particular features of this dataset include an inherent variance through cultural differences in game rules and styles as the data was recorded in two countries, as well as different sport skill levels, since the participants were heterogeneous in terms of prior basketball ex",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个基准数据集，用于评估腕部传感器测量的体育人体活动识别方法，具体应用于篮球训练、练习和比赛。篮球活动非常适合由腕部惯性传感器进行测量，能够检测到这种与运动相关的活动的系统可应用于比赛分析、指导训练和个人体育活动跟踪。该数据集记录了来自两个不同国家（美国和德国）的两支团队共24名运动员，在重复的篮球训练课和完整比赛期间他们佩戴了腕部惯性传感器。这个数据集的特点包括数据在两个国家记录，由于文化差异在游戏规则和风格中固有的差异，以及不同的运动技能水平，因为参与者在篮球经验方面是异质的。",
