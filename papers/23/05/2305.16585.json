    "translated_abstract": "释义生成是自然语言处理中一个长期存在的任务。监督式释义生成模型需要人工注释，费用高昂且难以扩展。与之相比，自动注释的释义对通常缺乏语法多样性——生成的释义句子在句法上与源句子非常相似。在本文中，我们提出ParaAMR，这是一个基于抽象意义表示反向翻译创建的大规模语法多样化释义数据集。我们的定量分析、定性例子和人类评估表明，ParaAMR的释义和现有的大规模释义数据集相比在语法上更具多样性，同时保留了良好的语义相似性。另外，我们还展示了ParaAMR在三个自然语言处理任务中的应用: 学习句子嵌入向量、语法控制的释义生成和机器翻译的数据增强。",
