    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱推理 (KGR) - 回答大型知识图谱上复杂逻辑查询的任务，代表了一项重要的人工智能任务，涉及多种应用（例如网络威胁狩猎）。然而，尽管它越来越流行，但是 KGR 的潜在安全风险还未被广泛探讨，这一点令人担忧，因为它在安全关键领域的应用越来越广泛。本文是架起狭隘鸿沟的一个可靠的初始步骤。我们根据攻击者的目的、知识和攻击向量系统化地概括了 KGR 的安全威胁。此外，我们提出了 ROAR，一种新型攻击，它是实现各种此类威胁的攻击。通过在代表性用例（如医疗决策支持、网络威胁狩猎和常识推理）中的实证评估，我们证明 ROAR 对于误导 KGR 提供预定义答案的目标查询非常有效，但对非目标查询影响微乎其微。",
