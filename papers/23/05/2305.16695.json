    "abstract": "We study a game-theoretic model of information retrieval, in which strategic publishers aim to maximize their chances of being ranked first by the search engine, while maintaining the integrity of their original documents. We show that the commonly used PRP ranking scheme results in an unstable environment where games often fail to reach pure Nash equilibrium. We propose the Relative Ranking Principle (RRP) as an alternative ranking principle, and introduce two ranking functions that are instances of the RRP. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that these methods lead to a stable search ecosystem, by providing positive results on the learning dynamics convergence. We also define the publishers' and users' welfare, and demonstrate a possible publisher-user trade-off, which highlights the complexity of determining which ranking function should be selected by the search engine designer.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种信息检索的博弈论模型，其中战略出版商旨在在保持原始文档完整性的同时最大化自己排名第一的机会。我们表明，常用的PRP排名方案导致环境不稳定，游戏经常无法达到纯纳什均衡。我们将相对排名原则（RRP）作为替代排名原则，并介绍两个排名函数，它们是RRP的实例。我们提供了理论和实证证据，表明这些方法导致稳定的搜索生态系统，通过提供关于学习动力学收敛的积极结果。我们还定义出版商和用户的福利，并展示了可能的出版商-用户权衡，突显了确定搜索引擎设计师应选择哪种排名函数的复杂性。",
