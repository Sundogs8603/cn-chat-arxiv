    "translated_abstract": "借助于近期大语言模型（LLMs）的显著发展，人们正积极尝试将LLMs的实用性扩展到多模态任务。已经有人尝试连接语言和视觉信息，并且也在不断尝试为LLMs添加视觉能力。然而，现有的尝试只使用LLMs作为图像解码器，没有尝试通过自然语言来生成图像。通过采用VQ-GAN框架，将图像的潜在表示视为一种文本标记，我们提出了一种新方法，可以微调预先训练的LLM，以像文本一样读取和生成图像，而无需进行结构更改、额外的训练目标或训练专门的网络，同时仍保留LLM的指令跟随能力。我们将此框架应用于胸部X线（CXR）图像的生成任务中，因为这是一个复杂信息在视觉和语言之间翻译的领域。",
