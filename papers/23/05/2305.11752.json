We propose two new algorithms to overcome these limitations: the greedy marginalized BS algorithm and the local focus BS algorithm.

    "translated_abstract": "从一系列测量数据中推断状态序列是生物信息学和自然语言处理中的基本问题。维特比算法和束搜索算法是流行的推断方法，但是当应用于层次隐藏马尔可夫模型（HHMM）时，它们具有局限性，因为感兴趣的是外部状态序列。维特比算法无法在没有内部状态的情况下推断外部状态，而束搜索算法需要对过多的状态空间进行边际化。我们提出了两种新算法来克服这些局限性：贪心边缘束搜索算法和局部焦点束搜索算法。我们证明它们比维特比算法更优秀地近似了最可能的外部状态序列，并且我们使用模拟和纳米孔基调用数据评估了这些算法的性能。",
