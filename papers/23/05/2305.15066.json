    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）如ChatGPT已成为人工通用智能（AGI）中不可或缺的工具，在各种自然语言处理任务中表现出色。现实世界中，图数据无处不在，是AGI的重要组成部分，在社交网络分析、生物信息学和推荐系统领域流行。大型语言模型的训练语料库通常包括一些算法组件，使它们能够在一些与图数据相关的问题上取得一定的效果。然而，目前对它们在更广泛的图结构化数据上的表现还缺乏研究。在本研究中，我们进行了深入调查，评估LLMs在理解图数据方面的能力，涵盖了多个结构和语义相关的任务。我们的分析包括10个不同的任务，用于评估LLMs在图理解方面的能力。通过我们的研究，我们不仅揭示了语言模型在图数据理解方面的当前限制，还发现了一些潜在的改进空间。",
