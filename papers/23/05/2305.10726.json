    "abstract": "Today, we have a mixture of young and older individuals, people with special needs, and people who can care for themselves. Over 1 billion people are estimated to be disabled; this figure corresponds to about 15% of the world's population, with 3.8% (approximately 190 million people) accounting for people aged 15 and up (Organization, 2011). The number of people with disabilities is upward due to the increase in chronic health conditions and many other things. These and other factors have made the need for proper care facilities urgent in today's society. Several care facilities are built to help people with disabilities live their everyday lives and not be left out of the community.",
