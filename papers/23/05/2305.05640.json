    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱是一种按本体或模式组织信息的流行方式，已经在从搜索到推荐的各种场景中得到了应用。尽管在知识图谱方面有了一些进展，但知识表示仍然是跨行业的一个非常棘手的任务，特别是在生物医学和医疗保健领域，由于实体之间的复杂相互关系、异质性、缺乏标准化和数据稀疏性等因素，这一任务尤其具有挑战性。本文提出了一种面向医疗保健领域构建面向实体的知识图谱的端到端表示学习方法，重点是捕捉生物医学领域的独特特征。所提出的框架名为HEER（Healthcare Entity-Entity Representation learning），将领域特定的约束和特征纳入到图嵌入算法中。对多个基准数据集的结果表明，与最先进的方法相比，HEER在改善下游预测任务方面具有有效性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes an end-to-end representation learning approach called HEER for constructing entity-centric knowledge graphs in healthcare. The method effectively improves downstream prediction tasks by incorporating domain-specific constraints and features into a graph embedding algorithm."
