    "translated_abstract": "在比较语言学中，词义共存指的是一个词汇形式传达两个或更多不同的意义的现象。现有的关于词义共存模式的工作基于注释的词汇表，限制了在自然语言处理中的可扩展性和实用性。相比之下，我们从未注释的平行语料库中直接识别了超过2,000个概念在1,335种语言中的词义共存模式。然后，我们提出了简单而有效的方法来建立基于词义共存模式的多语言图：ColexNet和ColexNet+。ColexNet的节点是概念，边是词义共存关系。在ColexNet+中，概念节点通过中间节点进行附加连接，每个中间节点代表1,334种语言中的一个ngram。我们使用ColexNet+训练高质量的多语言嵌入，称之为$\\overrightarrow{\\mbox{ColexNet+}}$，非常适合迁移学习。在实验中，我们首先展示了ColexNet在跨语言词义共存数据集CLICS上的高召回率。然后我们对建议的方法进行了评估...",
