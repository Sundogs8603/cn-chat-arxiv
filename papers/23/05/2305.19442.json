    "translated_abstract": "近来，由于元学习、微调、超参数调整等领域中嵌套优化结构的出现，联邦双层优化（FBO）在机器学习和边缘计算中显示了巨大的潜力。然而，现有的FBO算法往往涉及复杂的计算，并需要每次迭代多个子循环，每个子循环包含多个通信轮。在本文中，我们提出了一个名为SimFBO的简单灵活的FBO框架，它易于实现，不需要子循环，并包括一种广义的服务器端聚合和更新以提高通信效率。我们进一步提出了系统级异构鲁棒FBO（ShroFBO）作为SimFBO的变体，其对本地计算的异构有更强的鲁棒性。我们证明了在部分客户端参与和无替换的客户端采样下，SimFBO和ShroFBO可以实现线性收敛加速，同时改进了样本和通信复杂度。实验证明了它们在图像分类数据集的元学习和真实世界数据集上的超参数优化任务中的有效性。",
