    "translated_abstract": "在多智能体协作强化学习中，当智能体数量增加时，环境的随机性和不确定性会呈指数级增长，这就对如何从部分观测中得出紧凑的潜在表示以提升价值分解方法提出了难题。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种简单而强大的方法，通过引入单元级注意力状态表示（UNSR），缓解了局部可观察性并有效促进协同性。在UNSR中，每个智能体学习一个紧凑而解耦的单元级状态表示，该表示由Transformer块输出，并生成其局部动作价值函数。提出的UNSR用于通过多头注意力机制提升价值分解，以在混合网络中提供有效的信用分配，为个体值函数和联合值函数之间的有效推理路径提供支持。实验结果表明，我们的方法在几个基准环境中实现了最先进的性能。",
