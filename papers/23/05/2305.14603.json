    "abstract": "Representing texts as information about entities has long been deemed effective in event reasoning. We propose OpenPI2.0, an improved dataset for tracking entity states in procedural texts. OpenPI2.0 features not only canonicalized entities that facilitate evaluation, but also salience annotations including both manual labels and automatic predictions. Regarding entity salience, we provide a survey on annotation subjectivity, modeling feasibility, and downstream applications in tasks such as question answering and classical planning.",
