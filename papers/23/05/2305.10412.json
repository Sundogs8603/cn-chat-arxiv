    "abstract": "What role can AI play in supporting and constraining creative coding by families? To investigate these questions, we built a Wizard of Oz platform to help families engage in creative coding in partnership with a researcher-operated AI Friend. We designed a 3 week series of programming activities with ten children, 7 to 12 years old, and nine parents. Using a creative self efficacy lens, we observe that families found it easier to generate game ideas when prompted with questions by AI Friend; parents played a unique role in guiding children in more complex programming tasks when the AI Friend failed to help, and children were more encouraged to write code for novel ideas using the AI friend help. These findings suggest that AI supported platforms should highlight unique family AI interactions focused on children's agency and creative self-efficacy.",

    "translated_abstract": "AI能在家庭中发挥怎样的作用，支持和限制创意编程？为了调查这些问题，我们建立了一个\"人机交互\"平台，帮助家庭与由研究人员操控的AI朋友，进行创意编程的合作。我们与10个7至12岁的儿童家庭合作设计了一个为期3周的编程环节。通过创意自我效能理论，我们发现当AI朋友通过提问来引导游戏创意时，家庭更容易生成游戏创意；当AI朋友无法协助时，家长在指导孩子完成更复杂的编程任务方面起到了独特的作用；孩子们更加愿意使用AI朋友的帮助，写出新奇的编程创意。这些发现表明，AI支持的平台应强调家庭间以儿童为主角的AI独特互动，并关注创意自我效能。",

The paper emphasizes the importance of unique family AI interactions focused on children's agency and creative self-efficacy in AI-supported platforms."
