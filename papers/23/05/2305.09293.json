    "translated_abstract": "众所周知，当遇到以前未见的图像条件时，计算机视觉可能会不可靠。本文提出了一种根据基于正则化流的越界检测器自适应相机参数的方法。进行了一项小规模的研究，结果表明，根据这个越界检测器适应相机参数可以使 YOLOv4 目标检测器的 mAP、mAR 和 F1 性能指标平均提高 3 到 4 个百分点。作为次要结果，本文还表明可以在 COCO 数据集上训练正则化流模型来进行越界检测，该数据集比大多数越界检测器基准测试数据集更大、更多样化。",

Training a normalizing flow model for out-of-distribution detection on the COCO dataset is also demonstrated."
