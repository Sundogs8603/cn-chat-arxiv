    "translated_abstract": "模型计数问题，也称为＃ SAT，是计算给定布尔公式$ F $的模型或满足赋值的数量的问题。模型计数是计算机科学中的一个基本问题，具有广泛的应用。最近，越来越多地使用基于哈希的技术进行近似模型计数，并提供$（\\varepsilon，\\delta）$保证：即，计数返回的结果与确切计数的$(1+\\varepsilon)$-乘数具有$1-\\delta$的置信度。虽然哈希技术可在$ \\delta $足够大时具有合理的可扩展性，但在较小的$\\delta$值时，其可扩展性受到严重影响，从而阻止了其在需要高置信度估计的应用领域的采用。本文的主要贡献在于解决哈希技术的致命弱点：我们提出了一种基于取整的新方法，可以大大减少运行时间。",
