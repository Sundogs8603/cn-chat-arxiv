    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了Dolphin，一个新颖的基准，旨在满足对多种阿拉伯语言和变体进行自然语言生成（NLG）评估的需求。所提出的基准包括13种不同的NLG任务，包括对话生成、问题回答、机器翻译、摘要等广泛范围。Dolphin包括一个大型的语料库，包含40个多样化和代表性的公开数据集，分布在50个测试集中，经过精心策划以反映真实世界情景和阿拉伯语的语言丰富性。它为评估阿拉伯语和多语言模型的性能和泛化能力设定了新的标准，有望使研究人员能够推动当前方法的发展。我们对Dolphin进行了广泛的分析，突出其多样性，并发现了当前阿拉伯语NLG研究中的差距。我们还提供了一个互动和模块化的公共排行榜，并在其中评估了几个模型。",
