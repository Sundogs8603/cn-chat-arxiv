    "abstract": "While conditional generation models can now generate natural language well enough to create fluent text, it is still difficult to control the generation process, leading to irrelevant, repetitive, and hallucinated content. Recent work shows that planning can be a useful intermediate step to render conditional generation less opaque and more grounded. We present a web browser-based demonstration for query-focused summarization that uses a sequence of question-answer pairs, as a blueprint plan for guiding text generation (i.e., what to say and in what order). We illustrate how users may interact with the generated text and associated plan visualizations, e.g., by editing and modifying the blueprint in order to improve or control the generated output.  A short video demonstrating our system is available at https://goo.gle/text-blueprint-demo.",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然条件生成模型现在已经能够生成自然语言以创建流畅的文本，但控制生成过程仍然困难，导致生成无关，重复和虚假的内容。最近的研究表明，规划可以是一个有用的中间步骤，使条件生成 less opaque and more grounded. 我们提出了一个基于web浏览器的演示，用于基于查询的摘要，该摘要使用一系列问题 - 回答对作为蓝图计划，以引导文本生成（即，如何说什么以及以什么顺序）。我们演示了用户如何与生成的文本和相关的计划可视化进行交互，例如通过编辑和修改蓝图以改善或控制生成的输出。我们提供了一个短视频来演示我们的系统，可在https://goo.gle/text-blueprint-demo获得。",
