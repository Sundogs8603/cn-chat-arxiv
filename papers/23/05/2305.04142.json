    "translated_abstract": "脑网络，即MRI构建的图形模型，在病理预测和脑功能分析中被广泛使用。在复杂的脑系统内，神经元间连接强度的差异将脑划分为各种功能模块（网络社区），这对于脑分析至关重要。然而，由于神经元相互作用的复杂性，识别脑中的这些社区是一个非常棘手的问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的可解释的基于Transformer的模型，用于联合层次聚类识别和脑网络分类。在真实的脑网络数据集上进行的广泛实验结果表明，通过层次聚类的帮助，该模型在提供关于脑区域功能组织合理见解的同时，实现了提高准确性和降低运行时复杂度。实现可在https://github.com/DDVD233/THC找到。",
