    "translated_abstract": "领域泛化是机器学习中一个重要的开放性问题。深度模型容易受到甚至微小程度的领域偏移的影响，在实际应用中严重损害其可靠性。为了缓解这个问题，大多数现有的方法在多个训练领域上加强各种不变量限制。然而，这种方法通常不能为新的测试领域提供很好的性能保证。在本文中，我们研究了一种不同的方法，名为对比领域泛化（CDG），它利用强烈对比的数据对所展示的语义不变性，而不是多个域。我们提出了一个因果领域泛化理论，展示了CDG的潜在能力；同时，我们还提出了一种正则化技术——Logit Attribution Matching (LAM)，以实现CDG。我们在实证上展示了，LAM仅使用少量配对数据就能胜过最先进的DG方法，而且LAM有助于模型更好地关注对领域泛化至关重要的语义特征。",
