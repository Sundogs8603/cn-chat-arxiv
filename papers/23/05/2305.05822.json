    "abstract": "I study how to regulate firms' access to consumer data when it is used for price discrimination and the regulator possesses non-Bayesian uncertainty about the correlation structure between data and willingness to pay. Therefore, it is unclear how the monopolist will segment the market. I characterize all policies that maximize worst-case consumer surplus: the regulator allows the monopolist to access data, if the database does not reveal a minority group of consumers.",
