    "abstract": "We introduce a novel dataset consisting of images depicting pink eggs that have been identified as Pomacea canaliculata eggs, accompanied by corresponding bounding box annotations. The purpose of this dataset is to aid researchers in the analysis of the spread of Pomacea canaliculata species by utilizing deep learning techniques, as well as supporting other investigative pursuits that require visual data pertaining to the eggs of Pomacea canaliculata. It is worth noting, however, that the identity of the eggs in question is not definitively established, as other species within the same taxonomic family have been observed to lay similar-looking eggs in regions of the Americas. Therefore, a crucial prerequisite to any decision regarding the elimination of these eggs would be to establish with certainty whether they are exclusively attributable to invasive Pomacea canaliculata or if other species are also involved.

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一个新颖的数据集，其中包含了被确认为褐化螺(P. canaliculata)蛋的图像，附带了对应的边界框注释。该数据集的目的是利用深度学习技术帮助研究人员分析P. canaliculata物种的传播情况，并支持其他需要与褐化螺蛋相关的视觉数据的调查活动。然而，需要注意的是，有其他物种在美洲地区产生类似褐化螺蛋的观察记录。因此，任何消除这些蛋的决定的关键前提是明确它们是否完全归属于入侵的P. canaliculata或是否涉及其他物种。",
