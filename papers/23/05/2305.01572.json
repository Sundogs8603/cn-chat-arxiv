    "translated_abstract": "论文的影响力通常是通过其引用数量来衡量的。然而，大多数常用的模型可能会低估新发表论文随时间的影响力，并且未能将这种引文网络的动态性纳入图中。在本研究中，我们构建了一个具有年度视角的目标论文的分层异构图，并记录了目标论文科学背景信息的年度动态性。然后，我们提出了一种新的图神经网络模型，称为分层异构对比图学习模型（H2CGL），以融合引文网络的异构性和动态性。H2CGL分别聚合了每年的异构信息，并优先考虑高被引论文以及参考文献和引文与目标论文之间的关系。然后，它采用加权GIN来捕捉年份之间的异构子图动态性。此外，它采用对比学习来提高模型效果。",
