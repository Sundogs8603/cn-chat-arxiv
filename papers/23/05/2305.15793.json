    "title": "Feature space reduction method for ultrahigh-dimensional, multiclass data: Random forest-based multiround screening (RFMS). (arXiv:2305.15793v1 [cs.LG])",
    "abstract": "In recent years, numerous screening methods have been published for ultrahigh-dimensional data that contain hundreds of thousands of features; however, most of these features cannot handle data with thousands of classes. Prediction models built to authenticate users based on multichannel biometric data result in this type of problem. In this study, we present a novel method known as random forest-based multiround screening (RFMS) that can be effectively applied under such circumstances. The proposed algorithm divides the feature space into small subsets and executes a series of partial model builds. These partial models are used to implement tournament-based sorting and the selection of features based on their importance. To benchmark RFMS, a synthetic biometric feature space generator known as BiometricBlender is employed. Based on the results, the RFMS is on par with industry-standard feature screening methods while simultaneously possessing many advantages over these methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，已有大量针对拥有数十万特征的超高维度数据的筛选方法被发布，然而，大多数方法无法处理数千个类别的数据。基于多通道生物特征数据验证用户的预测模型也面临着这个问题。本研究提出了一种新的方法，即基于随机森林的多轮筛选(RFMS)，可以在这种情况下有效地应用。该算法将特征空间划分为小的子集，并执行一系列部分模型构建。这些部分模型用于实现基于锦标赛排序和基于特征重要性的特征选择。使用合成生物特征空间生成器BiometricBlender来对RFMS进行基准测试。根据结果，RFMS与行业标准的特征筛选方法相当，并且同时具有许多优点。",
