    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is evolving towards artificial general intelligence, which refers to the ability of an AI system to perform a wide range of tasks and exhibit a level of intelligence similar to that of a human being. This is in contrast to narrow or specialized AI, which is designed to perform specific tasks with a high degree of efficiency. Therefore, it is urgent to design a general class of models, which we term foundation models, trained on broad data that can be adapted to various downstream tasks. The recently proposed segment anything model (SAM) has made significant progress in breaking the boundaries of segmentation, greatly promoting the development of foundation models for computer vision. To fully comprehend SAM, we conduct a survey study. As the first to comprehensively review the progress of segmenting anything task for vision and beyond based on the foundation model of SAM, this work focuses on its applications to various tasks and data types by discussing it",
