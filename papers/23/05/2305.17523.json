    "abstract": "This paper presents a comparative analysis of the performances of three portfolio optimization approaches. Three approaches of portfolio optimization that are considered in this work are the mean-variance portfolio (MVP), hierarchical risk parity (HRP) portfolio, and reinforcement learning-based portfolio. The portfolios are trained and tested over several stock data and their performances are compared on their annual returns, annual risks, and Sharpe ratios. In the reinforcement learning-based portfolio design approach, the deep Q learning technique has been utilized. Due to the large number of possible states, the construction of the Q-table is done using a deep neural network. The historical prices of the 50 premier stocks from the Indian stock market, known as the NIFTY50 stocks, and several stocks from 10 important sectors of the Indian stock market are used to create the environment for training the agent.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文比较了三种投资组合优化方法的表现。研究中考虑的三种投资组合优化方法是均值方差投资组合、分层风险平价投资组合和基于强化学习的投资组合。这些投资组合在多种股票数据上进行训练和测试，通过比较它们的年度收益、年度风险和夏普比率的表现来进行比较。在基于强化学习的投资组合设计方法中，使用了深度Q学习技术。由于可能的状态数很大，Q表的构建采用了深度神经网络。来自印度股票市场的50只领先股票（称为NIFTY50股票）的历史价格以及印度股票市场10个重要行业的多支股票被用来创建代理的训练环境。",
    "tldr": "本文比较了均值方差、分层风险平价和强化学习方法在印度股票市场上投资组合优化的表现，结果表明，基于强化学习技术的方法在年度平均回报率、风险和Sharpe比率方面都明显优于其他两种方法。",

The results show that the reinforcement learning-based method, using deep Q learning technique, outperforms the other two methods in annual returns, risks and Sharpe ratios."
