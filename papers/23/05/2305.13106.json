    "translated_abstract": "针对安全的自动驾驶（AD），我们考虑学习模型以准确捕捉人类驾驶员行为概率分布的多样性和尾部分位数，与AD车辆进行交互。这些模型通过从状态预测驾驶员的连续动作，对于缩小AD代理模拟与现实之间的差距特别重要。为此，我们适应了两个灵活的分位数学习框架：（1）基于倾斜绝对损失的分位数回归，和（2）自回归分位数流（一种归一化流的版本）。训练采用行为克隆方式进行。我们使用了包含多条高速公路上驾驶员轨迹的高D数据集。我们在一步加速度预测任务和多步驾驶员模拟推理中评估了我们的方法。我们报告了使用倾斜绝对损失作为指标的定量结果，并给出了定性示例，显示出我们的方法的性能。",
