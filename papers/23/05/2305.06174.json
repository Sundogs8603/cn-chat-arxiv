    "abstract": "Climate change is the defining issue of our time, and we are at a defining moment. Various interest groups, social movement organizations, and individuals engage in collective action on this issue on social media. In addition, issue advocacy campaigns on social media often arise in response to ongoing societal concerns, especially those faced by energy industries. Our goal in this paper is to analyze how those industries, their advocacy group, and climate advocacy group use social media to influence the narrative on climate change. In this work, we propose a minimally supervised model soup [56] approach combined with messaging themes to identify the stances of climate ads on Facebook. Finally, we release our stance dataset, model, and set of themes related to climate campaigns for future work on opinion mining and the automatic detection of climate change stances.",

    "translated_abstract": "气候变化是我们时代的核心问题，我们正处于一个关键时刻。各种利益集团、社会运动组织和个人在社交媒体上开展针对这个问题的集体行动。此外，社交媒体上的问题倡导活动往往是针对当前社会关注的问题，特别是能源行业面临的问题。本文的目标是分析工业、倡导组织和气候倡导组织如何利用社交媒体影响气候变化的叙事。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个最小化监督模型组合方法，并结合消息主题来识别Facebook上气候广告的立场。最后，我们发布了我们的立场数据集、模型和与气候宣传活动相关的主题，供未来的舆情挖掘和自动检测气候变化立场的研究使用。",
