    "translated_abstract": "LLM在许多任务中展现出了惊人的少量样本表现，但在生成信息提取所需的复杂输出结构时仍存在困难。这个限制源于LLM在没有微调的情况下倾向于生成自由文本而不是遵循特定语法的精确结构。在本文中，我们提出在解码步骤中使用形式语法约束来丰富模型。在搜索过程中，只有符合语法产生规则的有效令牌能被考虑到。这样就强制只产生有效的序列。我们的框架非常通用和灵活，允许任何上下文无关语法(CFG)集成到我们的自定义约束beam搜索实现中。我们展示了许多NLP任务的输出可以被表示为形式语言，使它们适合在我们的框架中直接使用。对于输出空间取决于输入的任务，我们提出了基于输入的CFG，根据特定于输入的特征更新产生规则。实验证明了我们的方法在生成复杂输出结构方面的有效性，并在四个信息提取任务上实现了最先进的性能。",
