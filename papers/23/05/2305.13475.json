    "abstract": "We investigate and prove the mathematical properties of a general class of one-dimensional unimodal smooth maps perturbed with a heteroscedastic noise. Specifically, we investigate the stability of the associated Markov chain, show the weak convergence of the unique stationary measure to the invariant measure of the map, and show that the average Lyapunov exponent depends continuously on the Markov chain parameters. Representing the Markov chain in terms of random transformation enables us to state and prove the Central Limit Theorem, the large deviation principle, and the Berry-Ess\\`een inequality. We perform a multifractal analysis for the invariant and the stationary measures, and we prove Gumbel's law for the Markov chain with an extreme index equal to 1. In addition, we present an example linked to the financial concept of systemic risk and leverage cycle, and we use the model to investigate the finite sample properties of our asymptotic results.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究并证明了一类受异方差噪声扰动的单峰平滑映射的数学性质。具体而言，我们研究了相关马尔可夫链的稳定性，证明了唯一稳态测度弱收敛到映射的不变测度，并证明了平均李雅普诺夫指数连续依赖于马尔可夫链参数。通过用随机变换表示马尔可夫链，我们能够陈述和证明中心极限定理，大偏差原理和Berry-Ess \\ 'een不等式。我们为不变和稳态测度进行多重分形分析，并证明了极值指数等于1的马尔可夫链的Gumbel定律。此外，我们提出了一个与系统性风险和杠杆周期金融概念相关的示例，并使用该模型研究了我们渐近结果的有限样本特性。",
