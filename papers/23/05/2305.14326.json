    "abstract": "Empowering language is important in many real-world contexts, from education to workplace dynamics to healthcare. Though language technologies are growing more prevalent in these contexts, empowerment has seldom been studied in NLP, and moreover, it is inherently challenging to operationalize because of its implicit nature. This work builds from linguistic and social psychology literature to explore what characterizes empowering language. We then crowdsource a novel dataset of Reddit posts labeled for empowerment, reasons why these posts are empowering to readers, and the social relationships between posters and readers. Our preliminary analyses show that this dataset, which we call TalkUp, can be used to train language models that capture empowering and disempowering language. More broadly, TalkUp provides an avenue to explore implication, presuppositions, and how social context influences the meaning of language.",

    "translated_abstract": "赋予力量的语言在教育、工作环境和医疗等许多现实世界的情境中都非常重要。尽管语言技术在这些情境中越来越普遍，但赋予力量在自然语言处理领域很少被研究，而且由于其隐性的特质，这一概念的实践化本质上具有挑战性。本研究借鉴了语言学和社会心理学的文献，探索了赋予力量的语言的特征。然后，我们通过众包的方式创建了一个新颖的 Reddit 帖子数据集，对这些帖子进行了赋予力量的标注，并分析了这些帖子对读者的赋予力量的原因以及发帖者和读者之间的社交关系。我们的初步分析表明，我们称之为TalkUp的数据集可以用来训练能够捕捉赋予力量和削弱力量语言的语言模型。更广泛地说，TalkUp为探索含义的含蓄性、预设以及社会背景如何影响语言的意义提供了一个途径。",
