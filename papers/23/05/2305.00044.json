    "translated_abstract": "在当今的经济环境下，使用电子记录准确地实时测量价格指数的变化对于跟踪通胀和生产率至关重要。本文开发了经验享乐模型，能够处理大量未结构化的产品数据（文本、图像、价格和数量），并输出精确的享乐价格估计和派生指数。为实现这一目标，我们使用深度神经网络从文本描述和图像中生成抽象的产品属性或”特征“，然后使用这些属性来估算享乐价格函数。具体地，我们使用基于transformers的大型语言模型将有关产品的文本信息转换为数字特征，使用训练或微调过的产品描述信息，使用残差网络模型将产品图像转换为数字特征。为了产生估计的享乐价格函数，我们再次使用多任务神经网络，训练以在所有时间段同时预测产品的价格。",
