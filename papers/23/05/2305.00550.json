    "translated_abstract": "机器学习已经成为解决许多实际问题的有价值资产。但是，对于网络入侵检测（NID），科学上的机器学习进展仍然受到从业人员的怀疑。这种脱节是由于研究论文的内在局限性引起的，其中许多论文主要旨在展示新方法“胜过”先前的工作，往往忽视了在实际系统中部署所提出解决方案的实际影响。不幸的是，对于NID来说，ML的价值取决于许多因素，如硬件，这些因素常常被科学文献所忽略。本文旨在通过“改变”研究中采用的评估方法，减少从业者对NID的ML的怀疑。在阐明影响ML在NID中实际部署的“因素”之后，我们提出了“实用评估”的概念，使从业人员能够评估ML方法在NID中的实际价值。然后，我们展示了ML在NID的最新研究状态存在几个不匹配之处，其中提出的假设与现实世界的要求分歧。具体而言，本文提供了一份ML NID最新研究的批判性评估，说明研究中作出的假设与现实世界要求的差异。然后，我们提出了一组指导方针，用于设计实验，可以在考虑实际系统的实际限制的情况下，比较不同ML方法在NID中的有效性和效率。最后，我们通过对真实NID数据集进行实验来说明我们的指南的应用。",
