    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型的最新进展促使研究人员在各种语言任务上检验它们的能力，但在研究模型如何处理跨单词和更大句法形式的意义交互方面几乎没有研究。我们以代理性作为语义概念，作为探究这种交互的案例研究。我们利用部分可选的英语及物动词的独特语言属性创建了一个新的评估数据集。该数据集被用来针对不同大小的三种模型类别进行测试，以查看它们是否对词汇级别的代理性敏感，以及它们是否能在特定的句法上下文中适当地应用这些词级先验知识。总体而言，GPT-3 text-davinci-003在所有实验中表现非常出色，远远超过其他测试的模型。实际上，与人类判断相比，结果甚至更好地相关。",
