    "abstract": "The single transferable vote (STV) voting method is used to elect multiple candidates in ranked-choice elections. One weakness of STV is that it fails multiple fairness criteria related to monotonicity and no-show paradoxes. We analyze 1,079 local government STV elections in Scotland to estimate the frequency of such monotonicity anomalies in real-world elections, and compare our results with prior empirical and theoretical research about the rates at which such anomalies occur. In 41 of the 1079 elections we found some kind of monotonicity anomaly. We generally find that the rates of anomalies are similar to prior empirical research and much lower than what most theoretical research has found. Most of the STV anomalies we find are the first of their kind to be documented in real-world elections.",

    "translated_abstract": "单一可转移选票（STV）投票方法用于选举排名选举中的多个候选人。STV的一个弱点是它未能通过与单调性和无表决悖论相关的多个公平标准。我们分析了苏格兰1,079个地方政府STV选举，以估计现实世界选举中此类单调性异常的频率，并将结果与关于此类异常出现率的先前经验和理论研究进行比较。在1079次选举中，我们发现41次出现某种单调性异常。我们通常发现异常率与之前的经验研究相似，远低于大多数理论研究发现的异常率。我们发现的大多数STV异常都是第一次在实际选举中记录到的。",
