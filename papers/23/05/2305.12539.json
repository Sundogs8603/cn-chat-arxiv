    "abstract": "Designing dynamic portfolio insurance strategies under market conditions switching between two or more regimes is a challenging task in financial economics. Recently, a promising approach employing the value-at-risk (VaR) measure to assign weights to risky and riskless assets has been proposed in [Jiang C., Ma Y. and An Y. \"The effectiveness of the VaR-based portfolio insurance strategy: An empirical analysis\" , International Review of Financial Analysis 18(4) (2009): 185-197]. In their study, the risky asset follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and diffusion coefficients. In this paper, we first extend their idea to a regime-switching framework in which the expected return of the risky asset and its volatility depend on an unobservable Markovian term which describes the cyclical nature of asset returns in modern financial markets. We then analyze and compare the resulting VaR-based portfolio insurance (VBPI) strategy with the well-known constant proportion portfolio",

    "translated_abstract": "在现代金融市场的周期性特征和市场环境转换导致预期投资回报和风险变化的情况下，本文将 Value-at-Risk（VaR）方法的思想引入组合保险策略，提出了一个考虑市场调制的 VaR 策略。与一个基于恒定比例投资组合保险（CPPI）的策略进行比较，结果表明在更为复杂的市场环境下，VBPI 能够更好地实施组合保险策略，并在动荡市场中表现出更好的抵御风险的能力。",
