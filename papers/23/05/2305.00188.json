    "translated_abstract": "整数线性规划模型适用于各种实际的组合优化问题，对于产业和管理部门具有重要影响。本论文开发了第一个独立的局部搜索求解器，可用于解决一般整数线性规划，并在大型异构问题数据集上进行了验证。我们提出一个局部搜索框架，切换三种模式，分别为搜索，改进和还原模式，并设计适应不同模式的定制算子，从而根据不同情况提高当前解的质量。对于搜索和还原模式，我们提出了一种名为“紧身动作”的算子，它可以自适应地修改变量的值，试图使某些约束变得更紧。对于改进模式，提出了一种高效的算子“举升动作”，可以在保持可行性的同时提高目标函数的质量。结合这些内容，我们开发了一个局部搜索整数线性规划求解器，称为Local-ILP。对MIPLIB2017的异构问题集进行的实验表明，Local-ILP表现优异，可以与最先进的整数线性规划求解器相竞争。",
