    "translated_abstract": "有效的探索被认为对推荐平台上用户体验的长期影响有积极作用。然而，确定其确切的好处一直是具有挑战性的。探索的常规A/B测试通常测量中性甚至消极的参与度指标，同时未能捕捉其长期效益。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一项系统性的研究，通过检查探索对内容语料库的影响来正式量化探索的价值，这是推荐系统中直接影响用户体验的关键实体。具体而言，我们引入了新的度量标准和相关实验设计来测量探索对语料库变化的益处，并进一步将语料库变化与长期用户体验联系起来。此外，我们研究了引入神经线性匀速臂算法构建基于探索的排名系统的可能性，并将其用作我们的案例研究的骨干算法。我们在大规模真实场景下进行了广泛的实时实验。",
