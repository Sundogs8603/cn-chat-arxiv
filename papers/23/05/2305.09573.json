    "translated_abstract": "在公众对技术信任下降的背景下，计算机伦理已经成为焦点，并且批评家已经对企业伦理洗涤提出了质疑。然而，很少有研究探讨AI伦理价值在技术公司中的实际实施情况。本文通过对负责将AI伦理融入产品开发的技术工人进行定性分析，发现工人们面临一个政策、实践和结果分离的环境。我们将AI伦理工作者解析为伦理企业家，他们在组织内工作，以使新的伦理相关实践制度化。我们显示伦理企业家面临三个主要障碍。首先，他们在围绕软件产品发布为中心的环境中努力使伦理优先考虑。其次，在以指标激励公司目标的情况下，伦理在难以量化。第三，频繁的团队重组使得获取知识和维护关系变得困难。",
