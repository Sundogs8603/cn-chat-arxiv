    "translated_abstract": "目的为评估Medicare Part D中CML患者中品牌伊马替尼（imatinib）的价格弹性，以确定高额的自费支出是否推动该人群明显的非依从性。数据源和研究设置使用TriNetX Diamond Network (TDN)美国数据库中2011年首次可用至在2016年初引入通用伊马替尼的专利过期结束期间的数据。研究设计我们实施了模糊回归不连续性设计，分别估计在 65 岁时 Medicare Part D 的入选对新诊断 CML 患者使用品牌伊马替尼的依从性和自费支出的影响。通过各种规格和稳健性检查来估计相应的需求价格弹性（PED）并评估结果。数据收集/提取方法在应用包含和排除标准后使用符合资格的患者数据。",
