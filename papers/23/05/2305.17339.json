    "translated_abstract": "同行评审分配算法旨在将研究论文分配给适当的专家评审人员，以最大程度地提高评审质量。有效的分配策略的主要挑战在于评估分配算法的更改如何映射到评审质量的变化。在本研究中，我们利用新近提出的政策，引入同行评审分配中的随机性——以缓解欺诈现象——作为评估反事实分配政策的宝贵机会。具体而言，我们利用这些随机分配所提供的积极概率来观察多种感兴趣的分配政策的评审结果。为了解决应用标准离策略评估方法所面临的挑战，例如违反积极性，我们引入了基于单调性和Lipschitz平滑性假设的部分识别方法，用于评估评审人员-论文协变量和结果之间的映射。我们将我们的方法应用于两种计算机同行评审数据。",
