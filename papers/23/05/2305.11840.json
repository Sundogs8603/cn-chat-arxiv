    "translated_abstract": "刻板印象基准数据集对于检测和缓解NLP模型中有关人群的社会刻板印象至关重要。然而，现有的数据集在规模和覆盖范围上存在限制，并且主要限于西方社会普遍存在的刻板印象。随着语言技术在全球范围内的普及，这一问题尤为严重。为解决这一问题，我们提出了SeeGULL，这是一个广泛覆盖的刻板印象数据集，利用大型语言模型（如PaLM和GPT-3）的生成能力，利用全球性的多样化评分池验证社会中这些刻板印象的普遍程度。SeeGULL使用英语，并包含涵盖178个国家、6个大洲和8个不同地缘政治地区的身份群体的刻板印象，以及美国和印度的州级身份。我们还包括不同刻板印象的精细冒犯分数，并展示它们之间的全球差异。此外，我们还包括比较注释。",

SeeGULL evaluates identity groups spanning 178 countries across 8 different geo-political regions across 6 continents, as well as state-level identities within the US and India. It aims to improve the sensitivity of NLP models to the diversity of people worldwide."
