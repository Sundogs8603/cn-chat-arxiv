    "translated_abstract": "电子商务搜索系统旨在为用户提供最偏爱的物品（例如产品）。由于海量数据和有限的响应时间，典型的工业排名系统由三个或更多的模块组成，包括匹配、预排名和排名。预排名被广泛认为是一个迷你排名模块，因为它需要对比排名模型更多的物品。现有研究着重于构建一个轻量级模型来模仿排名模型。预排名模型的指标使用离线评估的 ROC 曲线下面积(AUC) 来跟踪排名模型。然而，这样的指标与在线A / B测试在实践中不一致，因此工程师必须进行昂贵的在线测试才能得出令人信服的结论。在我们的工作中，我们重新考虑了预排名的作用。我们认为预排名的主要目标是返回最优的无序选择集，这使得后续的排名更加高效且适应性更强。",
