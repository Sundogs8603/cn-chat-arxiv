    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型具有很强的学习能力，使我们能够理解真实的物理世界，因此学习模拟复杂的粒子系统是一个很有前途的努力。然而，物理世界的复杂规律给基于学习的模拟带来了巨大的挑战，如相互作用粒子之间的不同空间依赖性以及不同时间戳之间粒子系统状态的不同时间依赖性，这些因素决定了粒子的相互作用行为和物理系统的演化模式。现有的基于学习的模拟方法无法充分考虑这些复杂性，因此无法产生令人满意的模拟结果。为了更好地理解复杂的物理法则，本文提出了一种新的基于学习的模拟模型——具有时空建模的图神经ODE模型（GNSTODE），该模型利用统一的端到端框架描述了粒子系统中不同时间和不同空间条件下的变化。",
