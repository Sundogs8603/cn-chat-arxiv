    "translated_abstract": "理解新兴技术和研发之间的关系一直是公司、政策制定者和研究人员关注的焦点。本文将新型数据来源和工具与一种新颖的技术相结合，构建一个将一组新兴技术与全球领先的研发支出公司相连接的模型。结果是画出了这个领域的新地图。这张地图展示了不同技术和公司在它们对应的维基百科资料中所包含的知识的相似程度，可以分析公司与新兴技术之间的最密切联系。与相关的一组专利数据的显著正相关验证了该方法的有效性。最后，一组循环经济新兴技术被匹配到了它们最接近的领先研发支出公司，这促进了未来针对特定技术主题、公司竞争格局和国家利益等更广泛或更狭窄应用模型的研究想法。",

The model can be applied in specific technology themes, company competitor landscapes and national interest concerns."
