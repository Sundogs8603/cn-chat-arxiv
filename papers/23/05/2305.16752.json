    "abstract": "We present MULTIGAIN 2.0, a major extension to the controller synthesis tool MultiGain, built on top of the probabilistic model checker PRISM. This new version extends MultiGain's multi-objective capabilities, by allowing for the formal verification and synthesis of controllers for probabilistic systems with multi-dimensional long-run average reward structures, steady-state constraints, and linear temporal logic properties. Additionally, MULTIGAIN 2.0 provides an approach for finding finite memory solutions and the capability for two- and three-dimensional visualization of Pareto curves to facilitate trade-off analysis in multi-objective scenarios",
