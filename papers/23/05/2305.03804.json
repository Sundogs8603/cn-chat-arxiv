This neural network mainly consists of tensor-product-based convolution layers and ensures two equivariances: translations of the lattice and rotations of the spins. I implement equivariant neural networks for two Kondo lattice models on two-dimensional square and triangular lattices, and perform training and validation. In the equivariant model for the square lattice, the validation error (based on root mean squared error) is reduced to less than one-third compared to a model using invariant descriptors as inputs. Furthermore, I demonstrate the ability to reproduce phase transitions of skyrmion crystals in the triangular lattice, by performing dynamics simulations using the trained model.",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了一种新的等变神经网络结构来模拟Kondo晶格模型的大规模自旋动力学。该神经网络主要由基于张量积的卷积层构成，并确保两个等变性：晶格的平移和自旋的旋转。本文实现了对二维正方形和三角形晶格上两种Kondo晶格模型的等变神经网络，并进行训练和验证。在正方形晶格的等变模型中，验证误差（基于均方根误差）相对于使用不变描述符作为输入的模型减少了三分之一。此外，通过使用训练模型进行动态模拟，证明了重现三角晶格中天空子晶体相变的能力。",
