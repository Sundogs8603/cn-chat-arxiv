The tool leverages an end-to-end trainable architecture that couples a BERT-based encoding module with a multi-label classification head to match relevant text passages from sustainability reports to their respective law regulations from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. We evaluate our model on two novel German sustainability reporting data sets and consistently achieve a significantly higher recommendation performance compared to multiple strong baselines.

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了sustain.AI，这是一个智能的、上下文感知的推荐系统，可帮助审计师、金融投资者以及广大公众高效地分析公司的可持续性报告。该工具利用了端到端可训练的架构，将基于BERT的编码模块与多标签分类头相结合，将可持续性报告中的相关文本段落与全球报告倡议（GRI）标准中的相应法律法规匹配。我们在两个新颖的德国可持续性报告数据集上评估了我们的模型，并始终实现了与多个强基线模型相比更高的推荐性能。此外，sustain.AI已经公开在https://sustain.ki.nrw/上提供给所有人使用。",
