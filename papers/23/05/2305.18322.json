    "abstract": "A number of datasets for Relation Extraction (RE) have been created to aide downstream tasks such as information retrieval, semantic search, question answering and textual entailment. However, these datasets fail to capture financial-domain specific challenges since most of these datasets are compiled using general knowledge sources such as Wikipedia, web-based text and news articles, hindering real-life progress and adoption within the financial world. To address this limitation, we propose REFinD, the first large-scale annotated dataset of relations, with $\\sim$29K instances and 22 relations amongst 8 types of entity pairs, generated entirely over financial documents. We also provide an empirical evaluation with various state-of-the-art models as benchmarks for the RE task and highlight the challenges posed by our dataset. We observed that various state-of-the-art deep learning models struggle with numeric inference, relational and directional ambiguity.",

    "translated_abstract": "创建了许多用于关系抽取（RE）的数据集，以帮助下游任务，如信息检索、语义搜索、问答和文本蕴含。然而，这些数据集未能捕捉到金融领域的特定挑战，因为大多数数据集使用维基百科、基于网络的文本和新闻文章等一般知识来源编制，阻碍了在金融世界中的实际进展和采用。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了REFinD，该数据集是第一个完全基于金融文档生成的关系注释的大规模数据集，涵盖8种类型的实体对之间的22个关系和约29K个实例。我们还提供了与各种最先进模型的经验评估，作为RE任务的基准，并强调了我们的数据集所面临的挑战。我们观察到，各种最先进的深度学习模型在数字推理、关系和方向模糊等方面都存在困难。",
