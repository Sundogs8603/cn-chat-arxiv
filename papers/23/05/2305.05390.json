    "translated_abstract": "心智理论（ToM）是指人类理解和推断他人欲望、信念和意图的能力。获取ToM对人类的社会认知和人际关系起着关键作用。尽管ToM对于社交智能至关重要，但现代AI和NLP系统仍然缺乏该能力，因为它们无法访问训练语料库之下的人类心智状态和认知过程。为了赋予AI系统ToM能力，缩小它们与人类之间的差距，在本文中，我们提出了COKE：第一个机器心智理论的认知知识图谱。具体而言，COKE将ToM形式化为一组45k+经手动验证的认知链，这些链描绘了人类在特定社交环境下的心理活动和随后的行为/情感反应。除此之外，我们还使用预训练的语言模型进一步推广了COKE，并构建了一个强大的认知生成模型COKE+。在自动和人工评估方面的实验结果表明，COKE对于各种与ToM相关的任务，包括社交常识推理、情感识别和可解释对话，具有有效性和可解释性。",
