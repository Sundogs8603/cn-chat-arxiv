    "abstract": "This work proposes the use of 3D convolutional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) to trace the changes and symptomatology produced by neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). In this work, we present a novel approach to detect and quantify changes in dopamine transporter (DaT) concentration and its spatial patterns using 3D CVAEs on Ioflupane (FPCIT) imaging. Our approach leverages the power of deep learning to learn a low-dimensional representation of the brain imaging data, which then is linked to different symptom categories using regression algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a dataset of PD patients and healthy controls, and show that general symptomatology (UPDRS) is linked to a d-dimensional decomposition via the CVAE with R2>0.25. Our work shows the potential of representation learning not only in early diagnosis but in understanding neurodegeneration processes and symptomatology.",
