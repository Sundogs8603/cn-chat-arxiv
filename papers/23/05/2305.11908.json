    "translated_abstract": "脑-机接口是一种使大脑与外部设备或计算机系统直接通信的技术，它允许个体只使用思维与设备进行交互，并具有在医学、康复和人体增强等领域中广泛应用的潜力。 基于脑电图（EEG）和事件相关电位（ERP）的拼写器系统是一种类型的脑-机接口，它允许用户在不使用物理键盘的情况下拼写单词，而是通过记录和解释在不同的刺激呈现范例下的脑信号。传统的非自适应范例将每个单词选择视为独立的，导致了漫长的学习过程。为了提高采样效率，我们将问题转化为多臂老虎机中一系列最优臂识别任务。利用预训练的大型语言模型（LLM），我们利用从先前任务中学习到的先验知识来通知和促进后续任务。我们提出的方法与现有方法相比具有更快的学习速度和更高的信息传输速率。我们在模拟ERP拼写实验和真实的EEG打字任务中展示了我们方法的有效性。",
