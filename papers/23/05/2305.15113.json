    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm that has been applied in various fields such as robotics, natural language processing and game playing achieving state-of-the-art results.

    "translated_abstract": "强化学习（RL）是一种强大的机器学习范 paradigm，已应用于机器人技术、自然语言处理和游戏中，取得了最新的成果。针对解决顺序决策问题，它通过设计可以从经验中学习，因此适应不断变化的动态环境。这些能力使其成为控制和优化工业复杂过程的理想选择。充分利用这一潜力的关键是将RL无缝集成到现有工业系统中。工业通信标准Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture（OPC UA）可能弥补这一差距。然而，由于RL和OPC UA来自不同的领域，需要研究人员来弥合两种技术之间的差距。本研究通过提供简要的技术概述并进行半详尽的文献综述来弥合这一差距，以获得深入的见解。",
