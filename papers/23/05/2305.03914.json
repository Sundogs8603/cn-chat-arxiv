    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑在非线性状态空间模型中，通过联合和递归估计动态状态和时间变化的过程噪声协方差，来解决雷达和声纳等传感器跟踪机动目标的问题。由于模型的非线性和先验概率分布的非共轭性，状态估计问题通常难以处理。本文提出了一种基于近似贝叶斯推理原理的递归解决方案，采用随机搜索变分推理法来估计后验分布。与现有的基于变分推理的噪声自适应滤波方法相比，我们做出了两个贡献。首先，我们引入了一个辅助变量，推导出增广状态空间模型，并将非共轭先验转化为共轭形式，简化了估计问题。其次，我们将该方法扩展到处理任意非线性观测方程，使该算法在实践中更具应用性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a variational nonlinear Kalman filtering method to handle the problem of unknown process noise covariance in nonlinear state space models. The method introduces an auxiliary variable and an augmented state-space model to simplify the estimation problem, and extends to handle arbitrary nonlinearity in the observation equation, making it more widely applicable."
