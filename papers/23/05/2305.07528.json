    "abstract": "The open road poses many challenges to autonomous perception, including poor visibility from extreme weather conditions. Models trained on good-weather datasets frequently fail at detection in these out-of-distribution settings. To aid adversarial robustness in perception, we introduce WEDGE (WEather images by DALL-E GEneration): a synthetic dataset generated with a vision-language generative model via prompting. WEDGE consists of 3360 images in 16 extreme weather conditions manually annotated with 16513 bounding boxes, supporting research in the tasks of weather classification and 2D object detection. We have analyzed WEDGE from research standpoints, verifying its effectiveness for extreme-weather autonomous perception. We establish baseline performance for classification and detection with 53.87% test accuracy and 45.41 mAP. Most importantly, WEDGE can be used to fine-tune state-of-the-art detectors, improving SOTA performance on real-world weather benchmarks (such as DAWN) by 4.48 A",

    "translated_abstract": "开放道路对于自主感知提出了许多挑战，包括极端天气条件下的能见度差。在好天气数据集上训练的模型经常无法在这些分布区域中进行检测。为了增强感知中的对抗鲁棒性，我们通过提示使用视觉语言生成模型生成了一个名为WEDGE（由DALL-E生成的气象图像）的合成数据集。WEDGE包括3360张手动注释的16种极端天气条件下的图像，支持天气分类和2D物体检测等任务的研究。我们从研究角度分析了WEDGE，验证了其在极端天气下的自主感知效果。我们建立了分类和检测的基准性能，分别为53.87%的测试准确度和45.41 mAP。最重要的是，WEDGE可用于微调最先进的探测器，将在真实世界气象基准测试（如DAWN）上的SOTA性能提高4.48 A。",
