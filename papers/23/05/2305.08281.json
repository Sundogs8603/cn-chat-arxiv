    "translated_abstract": "评估自动生成的摘要的事实一致性对于可靠的摘要系统的进步和应用至关重要。尽管近年来取得了一些进展，但现有的事实性评估模型仍然不够稳健，在新的领域中特别容易出现实体和关系错误。我们提出了一种简单的新方法FactKB，用于事实性评估，它可以在不同领域通用，尤其是在实体和关系方面。FactKB基于使用从外部知识库中提取的事实进行预训练的语言模型。我们引入了基于直接实体事实、基于实体辅助知识的事实以及通过知识库路径组合构建的事实三种互补的事实预训练目标。结果显示，得到的事实性评估模型在两个领域内的新闻摘要基准以及三个领域外的科学文献数据集上都取得了最先进的性能。",
