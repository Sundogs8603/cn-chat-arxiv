    "translated_abstract": "在图像分析中，从高分辨率遥感图像中精确地分割大区域仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。现有的有监督和无监督方法都受到对象尺寸巨大变化和尺度选择困难的影响，经常导致分割精度不佳。为了应对上述挑战，我们提出了一种基于深度学习的区域合并方法（DeepMerge），通过将Transformers、多级嵌入模块、基于段的特征嵌入模块和区域相邻图模型相结合来处理大的高分辨率图像分割。此外，我们提出了一种改进的二叉树采样方法，以生成多级输入，用于DeepMerge模型的输入。根据我们的最佳知识，提出的方法是第一个使用深度学习学习相邻段之间相似性进行区域合并的方法。我们使用远程感知数据集对所提出的DeepMerge方法进行验证。",
