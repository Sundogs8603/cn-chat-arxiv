    "translated_abstract": "近年来，室内定位因其在智能家居、工业自动化和医疗保健等领域的广泛应用而受到了重视，特别是随着越来越多的人依赖其无线设备进行基于位置的服务。基于深度学习的解决方案利用无线参数（如信道状态信息（CSI）和接收信号强度指示器（RSSI））在室内环境中准确估计无线设备的位置已经取得了很好的效果。然而，尽管深度学习模型在实现高准确度的定位方面取得了成功，但这些模型缺乏通用性，在不重新训练的情况下无法轻松部署到新环境或在动态环境中运行。本文提出了基于元学习的定位模型来解决传统深度学习定位模型中持续存在的通用性缺失问题。此外，由于元学习算法需要多元化数据。",
