    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们展示了当代语言模型具有先前未知的技能，即能够从高级文本描述中进行电路设计，类似于代码生成。我们引入了两个基准：Pins100，评估模型对电子元件的知识；Micro25，评估模型在Arduino生态系统中设计常见的微控制器电路和代码的能力，包括输入、输出、传感器、电机、协议和逻辑。在生成完整设备方面，像GPT-4和Claude-V1这样的模型在Pass@1方面达到了60%到96%的准确率。我们提供了六个案例研究，使用语言模型作为设计助手来设计中等复杂的设备，例如辐射供电的随机数发生器、表情符号键盘、可见光谱仪和几个辅助设备。同时，我们还对性能进行了定性分析，概述了评估挑战，并提出了改进复杂电路设计和实际应用性的发展方向。",
