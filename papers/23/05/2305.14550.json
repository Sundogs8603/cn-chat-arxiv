    "translated_abstract": "离线强化学习使代理能够从静态数据集中学习有效的最大化收益策略。离线RL的三大范式是Q-Learning、Imitation Learning和Sequence Modeling。一个关键的问题是：在什么条件下，哪种范式被优先选择？我们通过探索代表性算法——保守Q-Learning(CQL)、行为克隆 (BC)和决策Transformer (DT)——在常用的D4RL和Robomimic基准测试中的表现来对这个问题进行了实证研究。我们设计了有针对性的实验来理解它们在数据子优性和任务复杂性方面的行为。我们的主要发现是：(1)序列建模需要比Q-Learning更多的数据来学习竞争性策略，但更加稳健；(2)序列建模在稀疏奖励和低质量数据设置中比Q-Learning和Imitation Learning都要好得多；(3)随着任务范围的增加，序列建模和模仿学习更可取。",
