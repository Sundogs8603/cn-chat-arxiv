    "abstract": "Path of Destruction (PoD) is a self-supervised method for learning iterative generators. The core idea is to produce a training set by destroying a set of artifacts, and for each destructive step create a training instance based on the corresponding repair action. A generator trained on this dataset can then generate new artifacts by ``repairing'' from arbitrary states. The PoD method is very data-efficient in terms of original training examples and well-suited to functional artifacts composed of categorical data, such as game levels and discrete 3D structures. In this paper, we extend the Path of Destruction method to allow designer control over aspects of the generated artifacts. Controllability is introduced by adding conditional inputs to the state-action pairs that make up the repair trajectories. We test the controllable PoD method in a 2D dungeon setting, as well as in the domain of small 3D Lego cars.",

    "translated_abstract": "毁灭路径（PoD）是一种自我监督的迭代生成器学习方法。其核心思想是通过破坏一组物品来产生一个训练集，为每个破坏步骤创建一个与相应修复动作相关的训练实例。在此数据集上训练的生成器可以通过从任意状态“修复”来生成新的物品。PoD方法在原始训练示例方面非常节省，并且非常适合由分类数据组成的功能部件，例如游戏关卡和离散的3D结构。在本文中，我们将毁灭路径方法扩展到允许设计师控制生成的物品的各个方面。通过向构成修复轨迹的状态-动作对添加条件输入来引入可控性。我们在2D地牢设置以及小型3D乐高汽车领域测试了可控PoD方法。",
