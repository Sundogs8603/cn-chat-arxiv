    "translated_abstract": "无偏学习排名（ULTR）的目标是利用隐含的用户反馈来优化学习排序系统。在现有解决方案中，自动ULTR算法在实践中因其卓越的性能和低部署成本而受到关注，该算法同时学习用户偏差模型（即倾向性模型）和无偏排名器。尽管该算法在理论上是可靠的，但其有效性通常在弱日志记录策略下进行验证，其中排名模型几乎无法根据与查询相关性来对文档进行排名。然而，当日志记录策略很强时，例如工业部署的排名策略，所报告的有效性无法再现。在本文中，我们首先从因果角度调查ULTR，并揭示一个负面结果：现有的ULTR算法未能解决由查询-文档相关性混淆导致的倾向性高估问题。然后，我们提出了一种基于反门调整的新的学习目标，并提出了一种名为PropensityNet的算法，用于在强日志记录策略下为ULTR估计无偏的倾向性分数。多个数据集的实证结果表明，PropensityNet在强日志记录策略和弱日志记录策略下均优于现有的最先进的ULTR算法。",
