    "translated_abstract": "开发专门的对话系统以提供心理健康支持已成为越来越多的研究关注点。然而，由于个人信息的敏感性以及所需的时间和成本，获取大规模的真实多轮心理健康支持对话存在困难。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了SMILE方法，一种使用ChatGPT将公共单轮对话扩展为多轮对话的包容性语言扩展技术。我们首先进行了初步的探索性研究，验证了SMILE方法的有效性。此外，我们对使用和未使用SMILE方法生成的数据集进行了全面系统的对比分析，证明SMILE方法可以产生大规模、多样化、接近真实生活的多轮心理健康支持对话语料库，包括对话主题、词汇和语义特征。最后，我们使用收集的语料库来训练和评估专门的心理健康支持对话系统。",
