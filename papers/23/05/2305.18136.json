    "abstract": "The aim of this short note is to present a solution to the discrete time exponential utility maximization problem in a case where the underlying asset has a multivariate normal distribution. In addition to the usual setting considered in Mathematical Finance, we also consider an investor who is informed about the risky asset's price changes with a delay. Our method of solution is based on the theory developed in [4] and guessing the optimal portfolio.",
