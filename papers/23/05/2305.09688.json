    "abstract": "We present OOD-Speech, the first out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarking dataset for Bengali automatic speech recognition (ASR). Being one of the most spoken languages globally, Bengali portrays large diversity in dialects and prosodic features, which demands ASR frameworks to be robust towards distribution shifts. For example, islamic religious sermons in Bengali are delivered with a tonality that is significantly different from regular speech. Our training dataset is collected via massively online crowdsourcing campaigns which resulted in 1177.94 hours collected and curated from $22,645$ native Bengali speakers from South Asia. Our test dataset comprises 23.03 hours of speech collected and manually annotated from 17 different sources, e.g., Bengali TV drama, Audiobook, Talk show, Online class, and Islamic sermons to name a few. OOD-Speech is jointly the largest publicly available speech dataset, as well as the first out-of-distribution ASR benchmarking dataset for Bengali.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了 OOD-Speech，这是 Bengali 的第一个用于自动语音识别的越域基准数据集。作为全球使用最广泛的语言之一，Bengali 展示了大量的方言和韵律特征，这要求 ASR 框架对分布变化具有鲁棒性。例如，Bengali 中的伊斯兰宗教讲道是用明显不同的语调进行的，这也成为了分布变化的例子。我们的训练数据集是通过在线众包活动收集并筛选而来，共收集了来自南亚的 22,645 名母语为 Bengali 的说话者所录制的 1177.94 小时。我们的测试数据集则包括来自 17 个不同资源（如 Bengali 电视剧、有声读物、脱口秀、在线教学以及伊斯兰讲道等）的 23.03 小时语音数据，这些数据也都经过了手动注释。OOD-Speech 既是当前公开的最大的语音数据集，也是 Bengali 语音识别的第一个越域基准数据集。",
