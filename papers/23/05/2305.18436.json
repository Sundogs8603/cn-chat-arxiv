    "translated_abstract": "K均值聚类是一种广泛应用于大数据集中发现模式的机器学习方法。半定规划（SDP）松弛最近被提出用于解决K均值优化问题，具有很强的统计最优性保证。但实现SDP求解器的巨大成本使得这些保证无法应用于实际数据集。相比之下，非负矩阵分解（NMF）是一种简单的聚类算法，被机器学习从业者广泛使用，但缺乏坚实的统计基础或严格的保证。在本文中，我们描述了一种类似于NMF的算法，通过使用非凸Burer-Monteiro分解方法解决半定规划松弛的K均值公式的非负低秩限制。所得到的算法与最先进的NMF算法一样简单和可扩展，同时也享有与SDP相同的强大的统计最优性保证。在我们的实验中，我们证明了我们的算法优于现有的NMF算法，并在合成和实际数据集上表现与最先进的SDP求解器相当。",
