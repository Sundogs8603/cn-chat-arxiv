    "abstract": "Organizations face numerous challenges posed by unexpected events such as energy price hikes, pandemic disruptions, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters, and the factors that contribute to organizational success in dealing with such disruptions often remain unclear. This paper analyzes the roles of top-down and bottom-up organizational structures in promoting organizational resilience. To do so, an agent-based model of stylized organizations is introduced that features learning, adaptation, different modes of organizing, and environmental disruptions. The results indicate that bottom-up designed organizations tend to have a higher ability to absorb the effects of environmental disruptions, and situations are identified in which either top-down or bottom-up designed organizations have an advantage in recovering from shocks.",

    "translated_abstract": "组织面临许多意想不到的挑战，例如能源价格上涨，大流行干扰，恐怖袭击和自然灾害。在应对此类干扰方面，对促进组织成功的因素的分析往往不清楚。本文分析了自上而下和自下而上组织结构在促进组织弹性方面的作用。为此，引入了一种基于代理的模型来模拟风格化的组织，其中包括学习、适应、不同的组织模式和环境干扰。结果表明，自下而上设计的组织往往具有更高的吸收环境干扰的能力，并且可以确定一些情况，其中自上而下或自下而上设计的组织在从冲击中恢复时具有优势。",
