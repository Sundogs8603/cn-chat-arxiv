    "translated_abstract": "工具作为关键的界面，使人类能够理解和改变环境。随着基础模型的出现，AI系统可以利用工具扩展其能力并与真实世界互动。现有的工具学习方法包括监督微调和提示工程方法，通常使大型语言模型不加选择地利用工具，因为复杂任务往往超出了它们自身的能力。然而，为简单任务引入工具（模型本身可以轻松解决的任务），可能会无意间传播错误而不是提高性能。因此，研究问题是：我们能否教会语言模型何时以及如何使用工具？为满足这个需求，我们提出了Tool leaRning wIth exeCution fEedback (TRICE)，这是一个两阶段的端到端框架，使模型能够通过从工具执行中得到的反馈不断学习，从而学会何时以及如何有效地使用工具。",
