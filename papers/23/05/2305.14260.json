    "abstract": "Intelligent navigation-helper agents are critical as they can navigate users in unknown areas through environmental awareness and conversational ability, serving as potential accessibility tools for individuals with disabilities. In this work, we first introduce a novel benchmark, Respond to Help Requests (R2H), to promote the development of multi-modal navigation helpers capable of responding to requests for help, utilizing existing dialog-based embodied datasets. R2H mainly includes two tasks: (1) Respond to Dialog History (RDH), which assesses the helper agent's ability to generate informative responses based on a given dialog history, and (2) Respond during Interaction (RdI), which evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of the response during consistent cooperation with a task performer. Furthermore, we explore two approaches to construct the navigation-helper agent, including fine-tuning a novel task-oriented multi-modal response generation model that can see and respond, name",

    "translated_abstract": "智能导航助手代理人非常重要，因为它们可以通过环境感知和对话能力，引导用户在未知区域中进行导航，并成为残障人士的潜在辅助工具。在这项工作中，我们首先介绍了一个新的基准，Respond to Help Requests (R2H)，以促进开发能够回应帮助请求的多模态导航助手，利用现有的基于对话的体验数据集。R2H主要包括两个任务：(1) Respond to Dialog History (RDH)，用于评估助手代理人根据给定的对话历史生成信息量丰富的响应的能力，以及(2) Respond during Interaction (RdI)，用于评估响应在与任务执行者持续合作时的效果和效率。此外，我们还探讨了两种构建导航助手代理的方法，包括对一个新的任务导向的多模态响应生成模型进行微调，该模型能够观察并回应。",
