    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了拉格朗日流网络（LFlows），用于连续地建模流体密度和速度。所提出的LFlows基于连续方程的解，其中连续方程是描述不同形式的质量守恒性质的偏微分方程。我们的模型基于这样的思路：连续方程的解可以通过可微和可逆的变换表示为时间依赖的密度变换。因此，我们通过在时间上规定参数化的微分同胚变换来对基础密度进行转换以建模流体密度。与依赖于Neural-ODE或PINNs的方法相比，关键的优势在于速度的解析表达式始终与密度保持一致。此外，无需昂贵的数值求解器，也无需使用惩罚方法来实施偏微分方程。拉格朗日流网络在合成密度数据上显示出了更高的预测精度。",
