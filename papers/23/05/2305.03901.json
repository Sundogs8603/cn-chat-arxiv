    "translated_abstract": "MRI和PET是诊断脑部疾病的重要工具，因为它们提供了有关脑结构和功能的互补信息。然而，PET扫描成本高且涉及辐射暴露，导致PET缺乏。此外，同时进行超高场MRI和PET目前几乎不可行。超高场成像在临床和学术环境中都被证明是有价值的，特别是在认知神经影像学领域。为此，我们提出了一种从高场和超高场MRI合成PET的方法。从统计的角度来看，联合概率分布（JPD）是描绘PET和MRI之间相关性的最直接和基本的方法。本文提出了一种新的联合扩散注意力模型，该模型具有联合概率分布和注意策略，命名为JDAM。JDAM具有扩散过程和采样过程。扩散过程涉及将PET逐渐扩散到高斯PET，采样过程从高场和超高场MRI中选择适当的特征。实验结果表明，JDAM优于最先进的PET合成方法，并且对噪声 lesss 敏感。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method to synthesize PET images using a Joint Diffusion Attention Model, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is less sensitive to noise. This approach addresses the limitations and costs associated with PET imaging and the lack of simultaneous ultra-high-field MRI and PET scanning."
