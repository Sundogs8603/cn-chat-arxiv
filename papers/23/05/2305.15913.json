    "translated_abstract": "迷因是社交媒体上强大的交际工具，它们在政治、历史和社会文化现象中的不断发展使其成为理想的交流媒介。为了理解迷因传达的微妙信息，必须了解促进其整体吸收的背景。除了像knowyourmeme.com这样的几个网站对迷因及其元数据进行数字存档外，目前没有有效的方法动态地推断迷因的上下文。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的任务，MEMEX，给定一个迷因和一个相关的文档，其目的是挖掘简洁地解释迷因背景的上下文。首先，我们开发了MCC（Meme Context Corpus），这是一个为MEMEX设计的新数据集。此外，为了基准测试MCC，我们提出了MIME（MultImodal Meme Explainer），这是一个多模式神经框架，使用通识强化的迷因表示和一种分层方法来捕捉迷因和上下文之间的跨模态语义依赖。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes the MEMEX task, which detects explanatory evidence for memes via knowledge-enriched contextualization. By constructing the MCC dataset, using a layered approach to capture the cross-modal semantic dependencies between the meme and the context, and proposing the MIME multimodal neural framework to explain memes, this study provides a novel solution for understanding the background and context of memes."
