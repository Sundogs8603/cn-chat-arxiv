    "abstract": "In this work, we carry out a data archaeology to infer books that are known to ChatGPT and GPT-4 using a name cloze membership inference query. We find that OpenAI models have memorized a wide collection of copyrighted materials, and that the degree of memorization is tied to the frequency with which passages of those books appear on the web. The ability of these models to memorize an unknown set of books complicates assessments of measurement validity for cultural analytics by contaminating test data; we show that models perform much better on memorized books than on non-memorized books for downstream tasks. We argue that this supports a case for open models whose training data is known.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究使用名字填空成员推断查询，对ChatGPT和GPT-4已知的图书进行数据考古学推断，发现OpenAI模型已经记忆了大量受版权保护的材料，并且记忆的程度与这些书籍在网上出现的频率有关。这些模型记忆未知的书籍的能力使得文化分析的测量有效性评估变得复杂，因为它会污染测试数据。我们展示了这些模型在记忆的书籍上的表现远远优于未记忆的书籍在下游任务中的表现，这支持了一个使用已知训练数据的开放模型案例。",
