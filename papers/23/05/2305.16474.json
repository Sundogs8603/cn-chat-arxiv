    "abstract": "This paper introduces FairDP, a novel mechanism designed to simultaneously ensure differential privacy (DP) and fairness. FairDP operates by independently training models for distinct individual groups, using group-specific clipping terms to assess and bound the disparate impacts of DP. Throughout the training process, the mechanism progressively integrates knowledge from group models to formulate a comprehensive model that balances privacy, utility, and fairness in downstream tasks. Extensive theoretical and empirical analyses validate the efficacy of FairDP, demonstrating improved trade-offs between model utility, privacy, and fairness compared with existing methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种名为FairDP的新型机制，旨在同时确保差分隐私(DP)和公平性。FairDP通过独立为不同的个体群体训练模型，在使用组特定的剪裁项来评估和限制DP的差异影响的同时操作。在训练过程中，该机制逐步整合来自群体模型的知识，制定综合模型以平衡隐私、效用和公平性的下游任务。广泛的理论和实证分析验证了FairDP的功效，与现有方法相比，展示了更好的模型效益、隐私和公平性的权衡。",
