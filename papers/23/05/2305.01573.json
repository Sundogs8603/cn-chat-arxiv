    "translated_abstract": "低功耗广域网络（LPWANs）是一种标志性的物联网范例，具有低功耗和远距离通信的特点。其中，LoRa因其独特的特性和开源技术而得到广泛应用。通过采用啁啾扩频（CSS）调制，LoRa可以实现低信噪比（SNR）通信。标准LoRa解调方法将整个啁啾信号的功率累加成频域中的一个能量峰值。这样，即使SNR低于-15 dB，它也可以支持通信。此外，我们提出了一种名为NELoRa的神经增强解码器，它利用多维信息实现了显著的SNR增益。本文介绍了用于训练/测试NELoRa的数据集，其中包括27,329个LoRa符号，其扩展因子从7到10，以进一步提高神经增强LoRa解调性能。数据集显示，NELoRa相比标准LoRa解码器可以实现1.84-2.35 dB的SNR增益。该数据集",
