Contrary to the global, and local approximations proposed in the literature to address the computational bottleneck with exact GP modeling, we employ a combined global-local approach in building the approximation. Our framework uses a subset-of-data approach where the subset is a union of a set of global points designed to capture the global trend in the data, and a set of local points specific to a given testing location to capture the local trend around the testing location. The correlation function is also modeled as a combination of a global, and a local kernel. The performance of our framework, which we refer to as TwinGP, is on par or better than the state-of-the-art GP modeling methods at a fraction of their computational cost.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的大规模高斯过程（GP）建模框架。与文献中提出的解决精确GP建模的全局和局部近似相反，我们在构建近似时采用了全局和局部相结合的方法。我们的框架使用子集数据方法，其中子集是一个旨在捕捉数据全局趋势的全局点集的并集，以及一个旨在捕捉给定测试位置周围局部趋势的局部点集。相关函数也被建模为全局和局部核的组合。我们的框架性能，即TwinGP，在计算成本的一小部分下与最先进的GP建模方法相当或更好。",
