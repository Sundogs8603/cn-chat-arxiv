    "translated_abstract": "非自回归翻译模型在句子级机器翻译中具有可比较的性能和更快的速度，然而它们在文档级机器翻译中的能力尚未被深入研究，这限制了它们在实际场景中的使用。本文对典型的非自回归模型在文档级机器翻译中进行了全面的研究，并进一步提出了一种简单而有效的源语言和目标语言之间的句子对齐设计。实验表明，非自回归模型在文档上取得了高度的加速，并且句子对齐明显提高了它们的性能。然而，当前的非自回归模型与自回归模型相比仍存在显著的性能差距。进一步研究发现，在文档级机器翻译的背景下，非自回归模型在多模态和对齐等问题上面临着更多的困难，目前的非自回归模型也难以充分利用文档上下文和处理话语现象。",
