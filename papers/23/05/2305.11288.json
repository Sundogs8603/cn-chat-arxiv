    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习领域，学习对称正定（SPD）矩阵的深度神经网络越来越受到关注。尽管取得了显着进展，但大多数现有的SPD网络使用传统的欧几里得分类器在近似空间上而不是在准确捕捉SPD流形几何的内在分类器上。受超几何神经网络（HNN）的成功启发，我们提出了Riemannian多类Logistic回归（RMLR）用于SPD网络。我们介绍了一个SPD流形上一族Riemannian度量的通用统一框架，并展示了特定的 $\\orth{n}$-不变的Log-Euclidean Metrics适用于SPD网络。此外，我们还将现有SPD网络中最流行的分类器作为我们框架的特殊情况。在流行的SPD学习基准测试上进行的广泛实验表明了我们分类器的优越性。",
