    "translated_abstract": "事件触发识别是许多领域中关键的信息抽取任务，如维基百科或新闻。该任务通常依赖于触发识别（TD）—识别文本中引起特定事件的标记范围。尽管触发器的概念应理想地适用于所有领域，但从高资源领域到低资源领域的TD领域转移会导致性能显著下降。我们通过使用基于规则的开放信息抽取（OIE）系统获取的主谓关系将触发器在领域之间进行耦合来解决TD中的负转移问题。我们证明通过多任务训练注入的OIE关系可以作为不同领域触发器之间的中介，增强零样本和少样本的TD领域转移，并减少性能下降，特别是从高资源源领域（维基百科）转移到低资源目标领域（新闻）。此外，我们将改进的转移与遮蔽语言建模结合起来。",
