    "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of a text mining tool the StyloMetrix developed initially for the Polish language and further extended for English and recently for Ukrainian. The StyloMetrix is built upon various metrics crafted manually by computational linguists and researchers from literary studies to analyze grammatical, stylistic, and syntactic patterns. The idea of constructing the statistical evaluation of syntactic and grammar features is straightforward and familiar for the languages like English, Spanish, German, and others; it is yet to be developed for low-resource languages like Ukrainian. We describe the StyloMetrix pipeline and provide some experiments with this tool for the text classification task. We also describe our package's main limitations and the metrics' evaluation procedure.",
