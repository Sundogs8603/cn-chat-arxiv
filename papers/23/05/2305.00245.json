    "translated_abstract": "金融领域已被证明是各种机器学习问题的丰富源泉，包括预测、聚类和分类。研究人员可以访问大量的时间序列数据，即使有较小的性能改进也可以转化为显著的附加价值。在本文中，我们考虑使用基于案例的推理来解决这个领域中的一个重要任务，即使用历史股票收益时间序列数据进行行业部门分类。我们讨论了为什么时间序列数据对于传统的基于案例的推理方法可能具有一些重要的表示挑战，并提出了一种基于股票收益嵌入的新型表示，可以从原始股票收益数据中轻松计算。我们认为这种表示法非常适合于基于案例的推理，并使用一个大规模的公共数据集对我们的方法进行评估，用于行业部门分类任务，展示了实质性的性能提升。",
