    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在研究噪声对Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程参数拟合的影响，重点考察了乘性噪声和热噪声对信号分离精度的影响。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了有效区分热噪声和乘性噪声、改善参数估计精度的算法和方法，探讨了乘性和热噪声对实际信号混淆的影响，并提出了解决方法。首先，我们提出了一种可以有效分离热噪声的算法，其性能可与Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC)相媲美，但速度显著提高。随后，我们分析了乘性噪声，并证明了HMC无法隔离热噪声和乘性噪声。然而，我们展示了，在额外了解热噪声和乘性噪声之间比率的情况下，我们可以精确地估计参数和分离信号。",
