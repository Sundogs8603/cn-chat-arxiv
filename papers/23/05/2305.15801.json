In this paper, we present Lucy-SKG, a Reinforcement Learning-based model that learned how to play Rocket League in a sample-efficient manner, outperforming by a notable margin the two highest-ranking bots in this game, namely Necto (2022 bot champion) and its successor Nexto, thus becoming a state-of-the-art agent. Our contributions include: a) the development of a reward analysis and visualization library, b) novel parameterizable reward shape functions that capture the utility of complex reward types via our proposed Kinesthetic Reward Combinatio",

    "translated_abstract": "在AI领域取得进展的一种成功策略是将游戏视为问题，这已被证明会导致各种重大突破。本文中，我们采用这种策略来研究“火箭联盟”游戏，这是一款广受欢迎但相对未被深入探索的3D多人在线游戏，具有独特的物理引擎和复杂的动力学，对于开发高效和高性能的游戏代理程序来说是一个巨大的挑战。我们提出了一种基于强化学习模型的 Lucy-SKG，以高效的方式学习如何玩火箭联盟游戏，在性能上明显优于本游戏中排名最高的两个机器人 Necto（2022年机器人冠军）和其后继 Nexto，从而成为最先进的代理程序。我们的贡献包括：a）开发了奖励分析和可视化库；b）通过我们提出的肌肉反馈组合，捕捉复杂奖励类型的效用的新型参数化奖励形状函数。",
