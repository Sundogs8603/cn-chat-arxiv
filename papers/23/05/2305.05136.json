    "translated_abstract": "乳腺X线摄影图像的分析需要准确的定位突出的乳腺肿块。在计算机辅助诊断领域，医师通常标记肿块或感兴趣区域(ROI)，并从中提取特征。本文提出一种新的乳腺肿块定位框架，基于堆叠自编码器的最大类激活值。我们假设在乳腺X线摄影图像中激活异常类的图像区域将是引起异常的乳腺肿块。实验使用IRMA乳腺X线摄影数据集中随机选择的200个图像(100个正常和100个异常)进行。由专业放射科医生标记的异常肿块区域用作标准答案。所提出的方法在突出区域检测准确性方面优于现有的基于深度卷积神经网络 (DCNN)的技术。所提出的贪婪回溯方法更为高效，不需要大量标记。",
