    "translated_abstract": "对比学习已成为少样本命名实体识别（NER）的一种受欢迎的解决方案。传统配置力求减少具有相同标签的标记之间的距离，并增加具有不同标签的标记之间的距离。然而，在医学领域中存在大量被注释为“O”（即“OUTSIDE”）的实体，并且它们不希望被推离到当前对比学习方法标记为“O”以外的其他实体，这种设定效果不佳，可能会得出含有噪声原型标签的语义表示，尽管存在许多“O”标签实体与有标签实体相关。为解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种名为医学少样本命名实体识别中基于加权原型的对比学习方法（W-PROCER）。我们的方法主要围绕构建基于原型的对比损失和加权网络展开。这些组件在协助在医学领域中的迁移学习方面发挥了至关重要的作用。在实验中，我们将W-PROCER应用于一个公共的医学数据集，并展示了其相对于现有的最先进方法的优异表现。",
