    "translated_abstract": "现代机器学习（ML）和边缘设备中的可穿戴医疗传感器（WMS）的进步使得智能医疗的ML驱动疾病检测成为可能。传统的ML驱动疾病检测方法依赖于为每种疾病和相应的WMS数据定制个别模型。然而，这种方法缺乏对分布变化和新任务分类的适应性。同时，为了检测每个新疾病，需要从头开始重新构建和训练模型。针对这些挑战，我们提出了基于WMS的多疾病检测持续学习框架DOCTOR。它采用了多头深度神经网络（DNN）和一种Exemplar-replay风格的CL算法。CL算法使得框架能够不断地学习新任务，其中涉及不同的数据分布、分类类别和疾病检测任务。DOCTOR在使用来自实际WMS的公共数据集进行四种常见疾病检测方面取得了最先进的性能。同时，在内存使用、电池消耗和检测复杂度方面，DOCTOR也优于基线方法。",
