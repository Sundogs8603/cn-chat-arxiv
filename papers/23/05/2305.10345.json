    "translated_abstract": "在家庭自动化和元宇宙人物模拟等众多应用中，4D人体感知起着至关重要的作用。然而，现有的解决方案主要依赖于摄像头和可穿戴设备，要么侵犯隐私，要么使用不便。为了解决这些问题，无线传感成为潜在的选择，利用激光雷达、毫米波雷达和WiFi信号进行非设备式人体感知。本文提出了MM-Fi，第一个包含27种日常或康复动作类别的多模态非侵入式4D人体数据集，以弥合无线传感和高级人体感知任务之间的差距。MM-Fi由40名人体主体的超过320K同步帧的五个模态组成。提供了各种注释以支持潜在的感知任务，例如人体姿态估计和动作识别。通过对多个任务的模态的感知能力进行比较，进行了大量实验。我们预计这些数据和所提出的评估协议将有助于开发新的无线传感算法，用于多种人体感知任务。",
