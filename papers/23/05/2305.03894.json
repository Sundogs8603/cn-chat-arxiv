    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种双支持向量分位数回归(TSVQR)，用于捕捉现代数据中异质和不对称信息。TSVQR利用分位数参数有效地描述了所有数据点的异质分布信息。相应地，TSVQR构造了两个较小的二次规划问题(QPPs)，生成两个非平行平面，以测量每个分位数水平下限和上限之间的分布不对称性。TSVQR中的QPP比以前的分位数回归方法更小且更易于解决。此外，TSVQR的双重坐标下降算法也加速了训练速度。在六个人造数据集、五个基准数据集、两个大规模数据集、两个时间序列数据集和两个不平衡数据集上的实验结果表明，TSVQR在完全捕获异质性方面的效果优于以前的分位数回归方法。",
