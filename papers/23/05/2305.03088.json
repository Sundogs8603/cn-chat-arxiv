    "translated_abstract": "会话问答生成（CQG）是机器通过对话帮助人类满足信息需求的关键任务。这个任务一般分为两种不同的设置：明确答案和不明确答案。虽然前者通过暴露预期答案来帮助模型，但后者更加现实并最近受到越来越多的关注。在不明确答案的设置中，“要问什么”和“如何问”是两个主要挑战。为了解决第一个挑战，现有的方法主要将上下文中的连续句子作为理由选择。我们认为，使用这种朴素的启发式方法生成的对话可能不够自然，因为在现实中，对话者经常谈论相关的内容，这些内容不一定是连续的。此外，先前的方法隐含决定要生成的问题类型（布尔/跨度），显式建模问题类型至关重要，因为答案（提示模型生成某种类型的问题）在无答案设置中不可用。为此，我们提出了一种新的方法，以端对端的方式共同模拟“要问什么”和“如何问”。具体而言，我们引入了一种新的理由选择方法，利用上下文和候选句子之间的相关性进行更自然的对话生成。此外，我们设计了一个问题类型预测器来明确模型中的目标问题类型。两个基准数据集上的广泛实验证明了我们提出的方法的有效性。",
