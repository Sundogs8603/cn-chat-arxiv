    "abstract": "A Conversational Recommender System (CRS) offers increased transparency and control to users by enabling them to engage with the system through a real-time multi-turn dialogue. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited an unprecedented ability to converse naturally and incorporate world knowledge and common-sense reasoning into language understanding, unlocking the potential of this paradigm. However, effectively leveraging LLMs within a CRS introduces new technical challenges, including properly understanding and controlling a complex conversation and retrieving from external sources of information. These issues are exacerbated by a large, evolving item corpus and a lack of conversational data for training. In this paper, we provide a roadmap for building an end-to-end large-scale CRS using LLMs. In particular, we propose new implementations for user preference understanding, flexible dialogue management and explainable recommendations as part of an integrated architecture",

    "translated_abstract": "对话推荐系统通过启用实时的多轮对话使用户更加透明和掌控。最近，大型语言模型展现了与人类对话自然的能力，并将世界知识和常识推理融入到语言理解中，进一步释放了这一范式的潜力。然而，在对话推荐系统中有效利用大型语言模型引入了新的技术挑战，包括适当地理解和控制复杂的对话和从外部信息源检索。由于大而不断增长的项目语料库和缺乏对话数据进行训练，这些问题加剧了。在本文中，我们提供了使用大型语言模型构建端到端大规模对话推荐系统的路线图。特别地，我们提出了用户偏好理解、灵活的对话管理和可解释的推荐作为整个系统的一部分的新实现方式。",
