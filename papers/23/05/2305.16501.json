    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在战略分类中的基础错误界限和样本复杂度，其中代理可以在一定程度上战略性地操纵其特征向量以预测为正。例如，给定一个确定大学录取的分类器，学生候选人可能会尝试选择更容易的课程来提高他们的GPA，重新参加SAT并更换学校，以尝试欺骗分类器。 在文献中，球操纵是一个广泛研究的操纵类别，代理可以在有界半径球内修改其特征向量。与大多数先前的工作不同，我们的工作认为操纵是个性化的，这意味着代理可以拥有不同水平的操纵能力（例如，球体操纵的变化半径），并且对学习者是未知的。我们在一个交互模型中形式化学习问题，其中学习者首先部署分类器，代理在其操纵集合内操纵特征向量以操作部署的分类器。",
