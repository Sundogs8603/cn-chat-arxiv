    "abstract": "Diffusion-based speech enhancement (SE) has been investigated recently, but its decoding is very time-consuming. One solution is to initialize the decoding process with the enhanced feature estimated by a predictive SE system. However, this two-stage method ignores the complementarity between predictive and diffusion SE. In this paper, we propose a unified system that integrates these two SE modules. The system encodes both generative and predictive information, and then applies both generative and predictive decoders, whose outputs are fused. Specifically, the two SE modules are fused in the first and final diffusion steps: the first step fusion initializes the diffusion process with the predictive SE for improving the convergence, and the final step fusion combines the two complementary SE outputs to improve the SE performance. Experiments on the Voice-Bank dataset show that the diffusion score estimation can benefit from the predictive information and speed up the decoding.",

    "translated_abstract": "近期研究了基于扩散的语音增强方法，但其解码过程非常耗时。解决方案之一是使用预测性语音增强系统估计增强特征，然后初始化解码过程。然而，这种两阶段方法忽略了预测性与扩散性语音增强之间的互补性。本文提出了一种集成这两个语音增强模块的统一系统。该系统编码生成和预测信息，然后应用生成和预测解码器，它们的输出被融合。具体地，两个语音增强模块在第一和最后一个扩散步骤中被融合：第一个步骤融合使用预测性语音增强来初始化扩散过程，以提高收敛速度；最后一个步骤融合将两个互补的语音增强输出组合起来，以提高语音增强性能。在Voice-Bank数据集上进行的实验表明，扩散评分估计可以从预测信息中获益并加快解码过程。",
