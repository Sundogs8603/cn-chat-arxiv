    "translated_abstract": "理解系统变量之间的因果关系对于解释和控制其行为至关重要。但是，从观察数据中推断因果图需要很多不总是现实的强假设。对于领域专家来说，很难表达因果图。因此，在将因果图用于下游任务之前，定量评估因果图的优劣的度量提供了有用的检查。现有的度量提供了一个绝对数量的因果图与观察数据之间的不一致性，而没有基础线，从业人员需要回答有多少这样的不一致性是可接受或预期的这一难题。在这里，我们提出了一种新的一致性度量方法，通过构建节点置换的替代基线。通过将不一致性的数量与替代基线上的数量进行比较，我们得出了一个可以解释的度量，捕捉有向无环图是否显著适合。",
