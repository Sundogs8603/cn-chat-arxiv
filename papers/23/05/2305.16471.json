We analyze nearly 6 million immigration court proceedings and 228 case features to build on prior research showing that U.S. asylum decisions vary dramatically based on factors that are extraneous to the merits of a case. We close a critical gap in the literature of variability metrics that can span space and time. Using predictive modeling, we explain 58.54% of the total decision variability using two metrics: partisanship and inter-judge cohort consistency. Thus, whether the EOIR grants asylum to an applicant or not depends in majority on the combined effects of the political climate and the individual variability of the presiding judge - not the individual merits of the case. Using time series analysis, we also demonstrate that partisanship increased in the early 1990s but plateaued following the tu",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项研究中，我们引入了一个新的双重评分系统，来衡量美国移民法庭（EOIR）中的个人和系统性偏见。我们分析了近600万个移民法庭诉讼和228个案件特征，以进一步研究美国避难决定如何受到与案件实质无关的因素的影响。使用预测建模，我们使用两个指标：党派性和法官间一致性，解释了总决定变异的58.54％。因此，EOIR是否授予申请人庇护，主要取决于政治环境和审判法官的个体变异 - 而不是案件的个体实质。使用时间序列分析，我们还证明党派性在1990年代初期增加，但在之后平稳了。",
