    "translated_abstract": "Levy步态中，步长出现频率遵循幂律分布，可以在各种生物的迁移行为中观察到。观察到了接近于2的幂指数的Levy步态，但其原因尚不清楚。本研究旨在提出一种普遍产生反平方Levy步态（称为Cauchy步态）的模型，并确定出Cauchy步态出现条件。我们证明了，在目标导向的任务中，Cauchy步态普遍出现。我们使用术语“目标导向”，当目标明确时，但可以通过不同的方式实现，而无法确定唯一的方式。我们进行了模拟，一个代理观察到在二维空间中从概率分布生成的数据，并连续估计该概率分布的中心坐标。代理有一个概率分布模型作为数据生成分布的假设，并可以修改该模型，以使其更符合实际情况。",
