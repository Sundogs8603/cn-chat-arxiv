    "abstract": "Creating a digital world that closely mimics the real world with its many complex interactions and outcomes is possible today through advanced emulation software and ubiquitous computing power. Such a software-based emulation of an entity that exists in the real world is called a 'digital twin'. In this paper, we consider a twin of a wireless millimeter-wave band radio that is mounted on a vehicle and show how it speeds up directional beam selection in mobile environments. To achieve this, we go beyond instantiating a single twin and propose the 'Multiverse' paradigm, with several possible digital twins attempting to capture the real world at different levels of fidelity. Towards this goal, this paper describes (i) a decision strategy at the vehicle that determines which twin must be used given the computational and latency limitations, and (ii) a self-learning scheme that uses the Multiverse-guided beam outcomes to enhance DL-based decision-making in the real world over time.

    "translated_abstract": "通过先进的仿真软件和普遍的计算能力，创建一个与真实世界的许多复杂交互和结果密切相似的数字世界是可能的。这种基于软件的与真实世界中存在的实体密切模拟的实体被称为“数字孪生体”。在本文中，我们考虑了一个车载毫米波段无线电的孪生体，并展示了如何加速移动环境中的方向波束选择。为了实现这一目标，我们超越了实例化一个单一的孪生体，并提出了“多元宇宙”范式，有几个可能的数字孪生体试图在不同级别的保真度下捕捉真实世界。为此，本文描述（i）车辆上的决策策略，确定由于计算和延迟限制必须使用哪个孪生体，以及（ii）一种利用多元宇宙引导的光束结果来增强基于DL的实时决策的自学习方案。",
