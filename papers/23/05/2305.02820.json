    "abstract": "Controlling chatbot utterance generation with multiple attributes such as personalities, emotions and dialogue acts is a practically useful but under-studied problem. We propose a novel controllable generation framework called DASC that possesses strong controllability with weighted decoding paradigm, while improving generation quality with the grounding in an attribute semantics space. Generation with multiple attributes is then intuitively implemented with an interpolation of multiple attribute embeddings. Experiments show that DASC can achieve state-of-the-art control accuracy in 3-aspect controllable generation tasks while also producing interesting and reasonably sensible responses, even if in an out-of-distribution robustness test. Visualization of the meaningful representations learned in the attribute semantic space also supports its effectiveness.",

    "translated_abstract": "控制聊天机器人生成具有个性、情感和对话行为等多个属性的话语是一个实际有用但鲜有研究的问题。我们提出了一种新颖的可控生成框架DASC，它通过加权解码范式具有强大的可控性，同时在属性语义空间的基础上提高了生成质量。然后，多属性生成通过多个属性嵌入的插值直观地实现。实验表明，DASC在三个方面可控生成任务中可以实现最先进的控制精度，同时产生有趣而合理的响应，即使在分布鲁棒性测试中也是如此。属性语义空间中学习到的有意义的表示的可视化也支持其有效性。",
