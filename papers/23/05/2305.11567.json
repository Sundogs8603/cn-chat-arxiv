    "translated_abstract": "时间序列数据在各个领域中非常重要，对机器学习研究者也很有兴趣。然而，时间序列数据通常很少或高度敏感，这使得数据在研究者和工业组织之间的共享以及现有和新的数据密集型 ML 方法的应用受到限制。解决这一难题的可能方法是生成合成数据。在这项工作中，我们介绍了时间序列生成模型（TSGM），这是一种用于生成合成时间序列数据的开源框架。TSGM包括广泛的机器学习方法：生成模型、概率模型和基于模拟器的方法。该框架使用户能够从不同的角度评估生成的数据的质量：相似性、下游效果、预测一致性、多样性和隐私。该框架是可扩展的，这使得研究人员能够快速实现自己的方法并在可共享的环境中进行比较。TSGM将有助于生成大规模的合成时间序列数据集，这些数据集可以用于训练和验证各种机器学习模型。",
