    "translated_abstract": "扩散是从高维分布中抽样的成功技术，可以明确给出或从样本集中学习。它们实现了一个扩散过程，其端点是目标分布的样本，漂移通常表示为神经网络。随机定位是在高维中证明马尔科夫链和其他函数不等式混合的成功技术。[EAMS2022]中引入了随机定位的算法版本，以获得从某些统计力学模型中抽样的算法。本文有三个目标：（i）将[EAMS2022]的构造推广到其他随机定位过程；（ii）澄清扩散和随机定位之间的联系。特别是，我们展示了标准去噪扩散是随机定位，但其他通过所提出的视角自然提出的示例；（iii）描述从这种联系中得出的一些见解；特别是，我们提出了一种新的算法，可以在对数步骤内从 Ising 模型的 Gibbs 测度中进行采样。",
