    "abstract": "Automatic music transcription (AMT) is one of the most challenging tasks in the music information retrieval domain. It is the process of converting an audio recording of music into a symbolic representation containing information about the notes, chords, and rhythm. Current research in this domain focuses on developing new models based on transformer architecture or using methods to perform semi-supervised training, which gives outstanding results, but the computational cost of training such models is enormous.  This work shows how to employ easily generated synthesized audio data produced by software synthesizers to train a universal model. It is a good base for further transfer learning to quickly adapt transcription model for other instruments. Achieved results prove that using synthesized data for training may be a good base for pretraining general-purpose models, where the task of transcription is not focused on one instrument.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动音乐转录（AMT）是音乐信息检索领域中最具挑战性的任务之一。它的过程是将音乐的音频录音转换为包含有关音符、和弦和节奏信息的符号表示。当前该领域的研究集中在开发基于变压器架构的新模型或使用半监督训练方法，这些方法取得了出色的结果，但训练这些模型的计算成本巨大。本研究展示了如何利用软件合成器产生的易于生成的合成音频数据来训练通用模型。它是进一步转移学习的良好基础，以快速适应其他乐器的转录模型。实现的结果证明，使用合成数据进行训练可以成为预训练通用模型的良好基础，其中转录任务并不集中于一个乐器。",
