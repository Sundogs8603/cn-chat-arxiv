    "translated_abstract": "国际海上犯罪变得越来越复杂，并常与更广泛的犯罪网络有关。仅融合与物理移动相关的数据（即由物理传感器或硬数据生成的数据）来检测海上威胁是不够的。这导致了研究和开发工作，旨在将硬数据与其他类型的数据（特别是人工生成的软数据）相结合。现有研究通常假设输入的软数据以结构化格式提供，或者集中于提取某些相关实体或概念以配合或注释硬数据。对于从未结构化格式（如情报报告和新闻文章）中提取与感兴趣情况隐含相关的丰富信息，关注度要少得多。为了利用这些来源中潜在有用和丰富的信息，需要提取不仅相关的实体和概念，还需要提取隐含于大量软数据中的相关情境的丰富知识。",
