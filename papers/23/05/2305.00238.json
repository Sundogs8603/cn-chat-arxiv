    "translated_abstract": "遗传算法（GA）是一种常用的元启发式进化算法，使用随机算子寻找最优解，在解决许多复杂的优化问题（如分类、优化和调度）方面证明了其有效性。但是，尽管其表现、流行和简单性，但对GA的可重复性和可重用性还没有受到足够的关注。在本文中，我们将可发现、可访问、可互用和可重用（FAIR）数据原则扩展到算法，以实现其可重复性和可重用性。我们选择GA作为示例演示所提出的原则的适用性。此外，我们还介绍了方法发展和GA变种的概述，这使得复制或甚至找到正确源变得具有挑战性。为了实现FAIR算法，我们提出了一个使用轻量级RDF格式的术语表（即$evo$），以促进可重复性。鉴于GA的随机性质，",
