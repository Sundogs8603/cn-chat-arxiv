    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种非常简单的方法——实例感知重复因子采样（IRFS），用于解决长尾目标检测中不平衡数据的问题。在现实世界的目标检测中，不平衡数据集通常会受到每个类别实例数量的巨大差异的困扰。为了提高目标检测模型在罕见类别上的泛化性能，已经提出了各种数据采样技术。由于其简洁和有效性，重复因子采样（RFS）已经显示出了潜力。尽管RFS效率很高，但它完全忽略了实例数量，仅依赖于图像计数来进行重新采样。然而，对于不同类别的实例计数可能巨大不同，虽然其图像计数相似。这种差异强调了解决长尾分布的不同方面的图像和实例的重要性。因此，我们提出了IRFS，它将实例和图像计数统一为重新采样过程的一部分，以便知道不平衡性问题的不同视角。我们在若干个长尾检测基准上评估了我们的方法，并表明IRFS优于现有采样方法并取得了最新的结果。",
