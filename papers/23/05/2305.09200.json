    "translated_abstract": "本文比较了迭代信念修正中三种最常见的状态表示方法：显式表示，按层次表示和按历史表示。前者是模型之间的连通偏序关系，第二种是表示等价类的公式列表，第三种是先前修订的序列。后者取决于修订语义和历史重写，而前者则取决于允许的重写。所有机制都表示所有可能的状态。用字典序修订的重写历史在大小方面比其他考虑的表示方法更有效率。证明了这样一个历史的冗余是一种轻微的重写。在一般情况下，这是一个coNP完全问题，即使在Horn公式的两次修订历史或任意长度的修订历史上，这也是困难的，但在两个Horn公式的历史上，它是多项式的。一个次要的技术结果是一个多项式时间算法，用于确定一个Horn公式是否等价于neg。",
