    "abstract": "Personalized news recommendation systems have become essential tools for users to navigate the vast amount of online news content, yet existing news recommenders face significant challenges such as the cold-start problem, user profile modeling, and news content understanding. Previous works have typically followed an inflexible routine to address a particular challenge through model design, but are limited in their ability to understand news content and capture user interests. In this paper, we introduce GENRE, an LLM-powered generative news recommendation framework, which leverages pretrained semantic knowledge from large language models to enrich news data. Our aim is to provide a flexible and unified solution for news recommendation by moving from model design to prompt design. We showcase the use of GENRE for personalized news generation, user profiling, and news summarization. Extensive experiments with various popular recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness of GENRE. ",

    "translated_abstract": "个性化的新闻推荐系统已成为用户浏览海量在线新闻内容所必需的工具，然而现有的新闻推荐系统面临着冷启动问题、用户画像建模和新闻内容理解等重大挑战。先前的研究通常通过模型设计遵循一种不灵活的例行程序来解决特定的挑战，但在理解新闻内容和捕捉用户兴趣方面存在局限性。在本文中，我们介绍了GENRE，一种LLM驱动的生成式新闻推荐框架，它利用来自大型语言模型的预训练语义知识来丰富新闻数据。我们的目标是通过从模型设计转移到提示设计来提供一种灵活而统一的新闻推荐解决方案。我们展示了GENRE在个性化新闻生成、用户画像和新闻摘要中的应用。使用各种流行的推荐模型进行的大量实验证明了GENRE的有效性。",
