    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在利用工具方面取得了重要进展，但由于API可用性和隐式推理的不稳定性，它们的能力有限，特别是在涉及规划和执行的情况下。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一个新的框架CREATOR，可以使LLMs利用文档和代码实现来创建自己的工具。CREATOR将抽象工具创建和具体决策执行解耦，从而提高了性能。我们在MATH和TabMWP基准上评估了CREATOR，分别包含具有挑战性的数学竞赛问题和多样的表格内容。值得注意的是，CREATOR优于现有的思维链、思维程序和使用工具的基线。此外，我们还引入了Creation Challenge数据集，包含2K个多样的问题，以强调LLMs创建工具的必要性和益处。进一步的研究表明，将LLMs用作工具创建者有助于提升知识的利用。",
