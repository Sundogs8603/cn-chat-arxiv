    "abstract": "Evidence retrieval is a core part of automatic fact-checking. Prior work makes simplifying assumptions in retrieval that depart from real-world use cases: either no access to evidence, access to evidence curated by a human fact-checker, or access to evidence available long after the claim has been made. In this work, we present the first fully automated pipeline to check real-world claims by retrieving raw evidence from the web. We restrict our retriever to only search documents available prior to the claim's making, modeling the realistic scenario where an emerging claim needs to be checked. Our pipeline includes five components: claim decomposition, raw document retrieval, fine-grained evidence retrieval, claim-focused summarization, and veracity judgment. We conduct experiments on complex political claims in the ClaimDecomp dataset and show that the aggregated evidence produced by our pipeline improves veracity judgments.

    "translated_abstract": "取证是自动事实核查的核心部分。 针对获取取证的假设不符合实际应用情况，之前的工作做出了简化的假设，即没有获取证据的权限，访问由人工事实核查员精简的证据，或在对主张确认之后很长时间才能获取证据。在本文中，我们提出了第一个完全自动化的流程，通过从网络中检索原始证据来检查实际主张。我们限制我们的检索器仅搜索在提出主张之前就已可提供的文档，模拟新出现的主张需要检查的真实情况。我们的流程包括五个部分：主张分解，原始文档检索，细粒度证据检索，主张焦点摘要和判断真实性。我们在ClaimDecomp数据集中对复杂政治主张进行实验，结果表明我们的流程产生的聚合证据可以改善真实性判断。人类评估发现，我们的摘要产生的证据要比由现有系统产生的证据更易于理解。",
