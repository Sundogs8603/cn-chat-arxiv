Leaning on information theory, we develop feature selection and engineering techniques for the observed downstream variables that act as proxies. We identify proxies that help to build stable models and moreover utilize auxiliary training tasks to extract stability-enhancing information from proxies.

    "translated_abstract": "统计预测模型通常是在与最终使用情况不同的概率分布中进行训练的。为了预测分布转移，有一种方法是利用因果机制在不同环境下保持不变的直觉来主动准备。本文针对一个具有挑战性的场景，其中目标的因果和反因果变量都是未被观察到的。利用信息论，我们为下游观测变量开发了特征选择和工程技术，这些变量充当代理。我们选择有助于建立稳定模型的代理，并使用辅助训练任务从代理中提取增强稳定性的信息。我们在合成数据和真实数据上展示了我们技术的有效性。",

The technique utilizes observed downstream variables as proxies for the unobserved causal and anticausal variables, and extracts stability-enhancing information from them through auxiliary training tasks."
