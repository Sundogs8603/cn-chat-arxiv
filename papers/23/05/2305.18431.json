    "abstract": "At Airbnb, an online marketplace for stays and experiences, guests often spend weeks exploring and comparing multiple items before making a final reservation request.

The long and exploratory nature of the search journey, as well as the need to balance both guest and host preferences, present unique challenges for Airbnb search ranking. In this paper, we present Journey Ranker, a new multi-task deep learning model architecture that addresses these challenges. Journey Ranker leverages intermediate guest actions as milestones, both positive and negative, to better progress the guest towards a successful booking.

    "translated_abstract": "Airbnb是一个在线住宿和体验市场，客人通常需要花费数周来探索和比较多个物品，并在做出最后的预订请求之前平衡客人和主机的偏好。搜索过程的长期性质以及需要平衡客人和主机的偏好，这些都为Airbnb的搜索排名提供了独特的挑战。本文提出了一种新的多任务深度学习模型架构Journey Ranker，以解决这些挑战。Journey Ranker利用中间的客户操作作为里程碑（无论是积极的还是消极的）来更好地将客户推向成功的预订。它还使用上下文信息（如客户状态和搜索查询）来平衡客人和主机的偏好。其模块化和可扩展的设计包括四个模块，分离明确，可以方便地应用于Airbnb搜索排名以外的用例。",
