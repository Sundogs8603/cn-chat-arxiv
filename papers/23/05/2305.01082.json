    "abstract": "Spellchecking is one of the most fundamental and widely used search features. Correcting incorrectly spelled user queries not only enhances the user experience but is expected by the user. However, most widely available spellchecking solutions are either lower accuracy than state-of-the-art solutions or too slow to be used for search use cases where latency is a key requirement. Furthermore, most innovative recent architectures focus on English and are not trained in a multilingual fashion and are trained for spell correction in longer text, which is a different paradigm from spell correction for user queries, where context is sparse (most queries are 1-2 words long). Finally, since most enterprises have unique vocabularies such as product names, off-the-shelf spelling solutions fall short of users' needs. In this work, we build a multilingual spellchecker that is extremely fast and scalable and that adapts its vocabulary and hence speller output based on a specific product's needs. Fu",

    "translated_abstract": "拼写检查是最基本和广泛使用的搜索功能之一。纠正拼写错误的用户查询不仅增强了用户体验，而且用户也期望能够实现。然而，大多数广泛可用的拼写检查解决方案要么比最新的解决方案精度低，要么速度太慢，无法用于延迟是关键要求的搜索用例。此外，大多数最新的创新架构集中在英语上，并且没有以多语言方式进行培训，并且是针对较长文本的拼写纠正进行培训，这是与对用户查询的拼写纠正不同的范式，其中上下文很少(大多数查询只有1-2个单词)。最后，由于大多数企业有独特的词汇，例如产品名称，现成的拼写解决方案无法满足用户的需求。在这项工作中，我们构建了一个多语言拼写检查器，它非常快速和可扩展，并根据特定产品的需求调整其词汇表和拼写输出。",
