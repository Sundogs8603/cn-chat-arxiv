    "abstract": "The increasing adoption of text-to-speech technologies has led to a growing demand for natural and emotive voices that adapt to a conversation's context and emotional tone. The Emotive Narrative Storytelling (EMNS) corpus is a unique speech dataset created to enhance conversations' expressiveness and emotive quality in interactive narrative-driven systems. The corpus consists of a 2.3-hour recording featuring a female speaker delivering labelled utterances. It encompasses eight acted emotional states, evenly distributed with a variance of 0.68%, along with expressiveness levels and natural language descriptions with word emphasis labels. The evaluation of audio samples from different datasets revealed that the EMNS corpus achieved the highest average scores in accurately conveying emotions and demonstrating expressiveness. It outperformed other datasets in conveying shared emotions and achieved comparable levels of genuineness. A classification task confirmed the accurate representatio",

    "translated_abstract": "文字到语音技术的日益普及导致了对于适应对话背景和情感语气的自然情感语音的需求。情感叙述故事（EMNS）语料库是一个独特的语音数据集，旨在增强交互式叙述驱动系统中对话的表现力和情感质量。该语料库包括一位女性演说者讲述标记话语的2.3小时录音，涵盖了八种表演情感状态，分布均匀，方差为0.68％，以及表现力水平和自然语言描述和词重音标签。对来自不同数据集的音频样本进行的评估表明，EMNS语料库在准确传达情感和表现力方面获得了最高的平均分。它在表达共享情感方面优于其他数据集，并达到了可比的真实水平。一个分类任务证实了准确的表示。",
