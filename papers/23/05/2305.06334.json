    "translated_abstract": "传统的药物研发项目正在通过机器学习方法进行转型。其中，生成AI方法因其设计新分子和增强现有分子特性的能力而受到关注。然而，当前的生成AI方法存在局限性，例如对目标的亲和力低，ADME/PK特性未知或缺乏合成可追溯性等。为了提高生成AI方法的适用范围，我们开发了基于变分自编码器和主动学习步骤的工作流程。设计的生成AI工作流程从分子指标，包括药物相似性、可合成性、相似性和对接得分中迭代学习。此外，我们还在最后的选择步骤中包括了一组基于先进的分子建模模拟的层次化标准。我们在两个模型系统CDK2和KRAS上测试了我们的生成AI工作流程。在两种情况下，我们的模型生成了具有高预测亲和力的可行化学分子。",
