    "abstract": "The study involved the analysis of emotion-associated language in the UK Conservative and Labour party general election manifestos between 2000 to 2019. While previous research have shown a general correlation between ideological positioning and overlap of public policies, there are still conflicting results in matters of sentiments in such manifestos. Using new data, we present how valence level can be swayed by party status within government with incumbent parties presenting a higher frequency in positive emotion-associated words while negative emotion-associated words are more prevalent in opposition parties. We also demonstrate that parties with ideological similitude use positive language prominently further adding to the literature on the relationship between sentiments and party status.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究分析了英国保守党和工党2000年至2019年的大选宣言中与情绪相关的语言。虽然以前的研究已经表明意识形态定位和公共政策的重叠之间存在一般的相关性，但在这类宣言中涉及情感方面仍存在矛盾的结果。利用新的数据，我们展示了党派地位对情感价值水平的影响，现任党派呈现更多与积极情绪相关的词语，而反对派党派中更多负面情绪相关的词语。我们还证明了意识形态相似的党派更多地使用积极语言，进一步增加了情绪与党派地位之间关系的文献。",
