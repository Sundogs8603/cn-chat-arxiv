    "translated_abstract": "图聚类一直是一个长期研究的话题，在近年来的深度学习方法中取得了显着的成功。尽管如此，我们观察到仍然存在一些重要问题尚未得到解决。一方面，从几何角度进行图聚类具有吸引力，但很少涉及到它的几何聚类空间。另一方面，对比学习可以提高深度图聚类的效果，但通常会在图增强或难例挖掘方面面临困难。为了填补这一空白，我们重新思考图聚类问题，并尝试首次引入异构曲率空间到图聚类问题中。相应地，我们提出了一个名为CONGREGATE的新颖的端到端对比图聚类模型，用Ricci曲率解决几何图聚类。为了支持几何聚类，我们构建了一个理论上支撑的异构曲率空间框架，可以捕捉图的各种曲率特征。我们提出的方法在几个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，展示了我们基于曲率的几何图聚类方法的有效性。",
