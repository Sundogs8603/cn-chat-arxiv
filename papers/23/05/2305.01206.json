    "translated_abstract": "CHC (Constrained Horn Clauses)的求解是许多验证和分析任务的基本挑战。数据驱动法在提高CHC求解效率方面显示出巨大的潜力，同时避免了手动创建和调整各种启发式方法的繁琐工作。但数据驱动的CHC求解器与基于符号推理的求解器之间存在巨大的性能差距。在这项工作中，我们开发了一个简单而有效的框架，\"Chronosymbolic Learning\"，它将符号信息和数值数据点统一起来，将CHC系统高效地求解。我们还展示了Chronosymbolic Learning的一个简单实例，其中包括一个数据驱动学习器和一个BMC样式的推理器。尽管该工具非常简单，但实验结果表明其效力和健壮性。它在由288个基准测试组成的数据集上胜过了最先进的CHC求解器，其中包括许多包含非线性整数算术的实例。",
