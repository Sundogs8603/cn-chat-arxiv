    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）由于易于获取和在多种应用中表现出的前所未有的智能而近来风靡一时。然而，像ChatGPT这样的LLM在支持复杂信息任务方面存在显着的限制，原因是基于文本的媒介和线性对话结构提供的功能不足。通过与十名参与者的形式化研究，我们发现LLM界面通常会呈现冗长的响应，使人们难以快速理解和灵活地与各种信息进行交互，特别是在更复杂的任务中。我们提出了Graphologue，这是一个交互式系统，将LLM的基于文本的响应转换为图形化图表，以便于信息查找和问题回答任务。Graphologue采用新颖的提示策略和界面设计，从LLM响应中提取实体和关系，并实时构建节点链接图。此外，用户可以通过选择和突出显示特定节点和链接来与这些图表进行交互，以探索相关信息和跟进问题。我们的用户研究结果表明，与传统的基于文本的界面相比，Graphologue显著提高了用户在复杂信息任务中的表现和满意度。Graphologue为增强LLM在各种应用和领域中的可用性和可解释性提供了一个有前景的方向。",
