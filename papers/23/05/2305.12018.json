    "abstract": "Energy-based models (EBMs) have gained popularity for controlled text generation due to their high applicability to a wide range of constraints. However, sampling from EBMs is non-trivial, as it often requires a large number of iterations to converge to plausible text, which slows down the decoding process and makes it less practical for real-world applications. In this work, we propose BOLT, which relies on tunable biases to directly adjust the language model's output logits. Unlike prior work, BOLT maintains the generator's autoregressive nature to assert a strong control on token-wise conditional dependencies and overall fluency, and thus converges faster. When compared with state-of-the-arts on controlled generation tasks using both soft constraints (e.g., sentiment control) and hard constraints (e.g., keyword-guided topic control), BOLT demonstrates significantly improved efficiency and fluency. On sentiment control, BOLT is 7x faster than competitive baselines, and more fluent in",

    "translated_abstract": "基于能量的模型（EBMs）因其在广泛约束范围内的高适用性而在控制生成文本方面变得流行。然而，从EBMs中进行采样是非平凡的，因为通常需要大量迭代才能收敛到合理的文本，这会减慢解码过程并使其在实际应用中不那么实用。在本文中，我们提出了BOLT，它依赖于可调偏置以直接调整语言模型的输出logits。与以往的方法不同，BOLT保持生成器的自回归性质，以断言对标记条件依赖关系和总体流畅性的强控制，因此收敛速度更快。在使用软约束（例如情感控制）和硬约束（例如关键字引导的主题控制）的受控生成任务上与最先进技术进行比较时，BOLT展示了显着的效率和流畅性改进。在情感控制方面，BOLT比竞争基线快7倍，并且更流畅。",
