    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体作为人们获取新闻的主要平台之一的出现，促进了虚假新闻的广泛传播。这激发了大量的自动化识别虚假新闻的研究。尽管已经有了一些未经监督的虚假新闻检测尝试，但它们的性能受到未利用与新闻记录相关的各种模态知识和现有新闻数据集中存在的各种潜在偏见的影响。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种有效的无监督虚假新闻检测框架，首先将新闻记录中四种模态的知识嵌入，然后提出一种新颖的噪声鲁棒的自监督学习技术，从多模态嵌入中识别新闻记录的真实性。此外，我们提出了一种新颖的构建新闻数据集的技术，最小化现有新闻数据集中的潜在偏见。按照所提出的数据集构建方法，我们制作一个基于语言的新闻数据集，用于评估所提出的框架的有效性。我们的实验表明，所提出的框架显著优于最先进的无监督虚假新闻检测技术。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new unsupervised and cross-domain framework for fake news detection, which embeds multi-modal knowledge and utilizes noise-robust self-supervised learning techniques. The proposed framework also includes a novel technique for dataset construction that minimizes the impact of latent biases. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing unsupervised fake news detection techniques."
