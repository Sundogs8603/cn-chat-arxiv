    "translated_abstract": "静态深度神经网络（DNN）水印技术通常采用不可逆的方法将水印嵌入DNN模型权重中。然而，这种方法会对水印模型造成永久性损坏，无法满足完整性验证的要求。可逆数据隐藏（RDH）方法提供了一种潜在的解决方案，但现有方法在可用性、容量和保真度方面存在弱点，阻碍了其实际采用。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于RDH的静态DNN水印方案，采用量化索引调制（QIM）。我们的方案采用了一维量化器的新方法进行水印嵌入。此外，我们设计了两种方案来解决DNN的完整性保护和合法认证的挑战。通过对训练损失和分类准确度的模拟结果，我们证明了我们提出的方案的可行性和有效性，并突出了其优越的适应性。",
