In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named PerFedRec++, to enhance the personalized federated recommendation with self-supervised pre-training. Specifically, we utilize the privacy-preserving mechanism of federated recommender systems to generate two augmented graph views, which are used as contrastive tasks in self-supervised graph learning to pre-train the model.

    "translated_abstract": "联邦推荐系统通过采用联邦学习技术，在用户设备和中央服务器之间传输模型参数而非原始用户数据来保护用户隐私。然而，当前的联邦推荐系统面临着异构性和个性化、模型性能下降和通信瓶颈等挑战。先前的研究尝试解决这些问题，但均未能同时解决。我们在本文中提出了一个名为PerFedRec++的新框架，通过自监督预训练来增强个性化联邦推荐。具体而言，我们利用联邦推荐系统的隐私保护机制生成了两个增强图视图，并将其作为对比任务用于自监督图学习中的预训练。预训练通过提高表示学习的一致性来增强联邦模型的性能。",
