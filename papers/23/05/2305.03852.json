    "abstract": "This paper explores the potential for utilizing generative AI models in group-focused co-creative frameworks to enhance problem solving and ideation in business innovation and co-creation contexts, and proposes a novel prompting technique for conversational generative AI agents which employ methods inspired by traditional 'human-to-human' facilitation and instruction to enable active contribution to Design Thinking, a co-creative framework. Through experiments using this prompting technique, we gather evidence that conversational generative transformers (i.e. ChatGPT) have the capability to contribute context-specific, useful, and creative input into Design Thinking activities. We also discuss the potential benefits, limitations, and risks associated with using generative AI models in co-creative ideation and provide recommendations for future research.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了将生成型AI模型应用于小组共创框架中，以增强商业创新和共创背景下的问题解决和构思的潜力，并提出了一种新的提示技术，用于启用对话式生成型AI代理的积极贡献到设计思维(co-creative framework)的办法，这种方法受到传统的“人与人”促进和教学方法的启发。通过使用这种提示技术的实验，我们收集了聊天生成型变压器(ChatGPT)为设计思维活动提供具有特定上下文、有用和创意性的贡献的能力的证据。我们还讨论了使用生成型AI模型进行共创构思的潜在优势、局限性和风险，并提出了未来研究的建议。",
