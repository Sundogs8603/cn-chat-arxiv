In this paper, we use contrastive learning to establish the representations of frames then use the learned representations in the downstream deep modularization task. Concretely, we demonstrate experimentally that in speech separation, different frames of a speaker can be viewed as augmentations of a given hidden standard frame of that speaker. The frames of a speaker contain enough prosodic information overlap which is key in speech separation. Based on this, we implement a self-supervised learning to learn to minimize the distance between frames",

    "translated_abstract": "目前，语音分离的最先进工具依赖于有监督学习。这意味着它们必须处理排列问题，它们受到训练和推断中使用的说话者数量不匹配的影响。此外，它们的性能严重依赖于高质量标记数据的存在。这些问题可以通过采用完全无监督的语音分离技术有效地解决。在本文中，我们使用对比学习建立帧的表示，然后在下游的深度模块化任务中使用学习到的表示。具体而言，在语音分离中，说话人的不同帧可以被看作是给定那个说话人的隐含标准帧的增强版。说话人的帧包含足够的韵律信息重叠，这是语音分离的关键。基于此，我们实现了自监督学习，学习缩小帧之间的距离。",
