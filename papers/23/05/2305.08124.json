    "translated_abstract": "信贷分配问题，例如RL中的策略评估，通常需要通过先前的状态或维护时间上延伸的记忆痕迹来引导预测误差;这些解决方案对于神经元的生物网络来说是不利或不可信的。我们提出Theta序列-海马中theta振荡期间的神经活动链，被认为代表清醒行为的快速播放-through，作为解决方案。通过分析和模拟Theta序列的模型，我们证明它们压缩行为，以使现有但短暂的O（10）ms神经记忆痕迹得以有效延伸，从而实现无需长期记忆痕迹的基于资格的追踪，相当于在TD（λ）中使用资格追踪。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了Theta序列作为生物神经网络中资格追踪的一种解决方案，通过模拟证明了Theta序列可以在不需要维护长时间记忆痕迹的情况下，实现对于预测误差的引导。",
