    "abstract": "Search in collections of digitised historical documents is hindered by a two-prong problem, orthographic variety and optical character recognition (OCR) mistakes. We present a new search engine for historical documents, DuoSearch, which uses ElasticSearch and machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to offer a solution to this problem. It was tested on a collection of historical newspapers in Bulgarian from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century. The system provides an interactive and intuitive interface for the end-users allowing them to enter search terms in modern Bulgarian and search across historical spellings. This is the first solution facilitating the use of digitised historical documents in Bulgarian.",

    "translated_abstract": "数字化历史文献的搜索存在正字法变体和字符识别错误两大问题。本文提出了一种新的历史文件搜索引擎——DuoSearch，它使用ElasticSearch和基于深度神经网络的机器学习方法，提供了解决这个问题的方案。该系统在保加利亚中期到20世纪中期的历史报纸集合上进行了测试，为最终用户提供了交互式和直观的界面，允许他们以现代保加利亚语输入搜索词并跨历史拼写进行搜索。这是首个易于使用数字化保加利亚历史文献的解决方案。",
