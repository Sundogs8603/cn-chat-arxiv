    "translated_abstract": "如今，深度神经网络在安全关键应用中的广泛应用引起了新的可靠性关注。实际上，通过硬件仿真进行故障注入的方法是研究DNN架构容错性的有效和广泛使用的方法，早期设计阶段已经减轻了可靠性问题。然而，目前的故障注入方法在时间、设计和控制复杂性方面存在一系列问题。为了克服这些问题，提出了一种新的容错评估方法，称为APPRAISER，它将函数近似用于非传统用途，并利用近似计算误差。通过在容错评估领域采用这个概念，APPRAISER提供了成千上万倍的评估速度提升，同时保持了分析的高准确性。本文通过与最先进的故障注入方法进行比较，验证了APPRAISER的有效性。",
