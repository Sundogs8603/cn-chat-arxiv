    "translated_abstract": "近年来，生成模型的进展使得这些模型能够为大多数文本输入生成既逼真又相关的图像。这些模型每天生成数百万张图像，并具有极大的潜力，可以极大地影响生成艺术、数字营销和数据增强等领域。鉴于其巨大的影响力，重要的是要确保生成的内容反映全球各地的文物和环境，而不是过度代表某些地区。在本文中，我们使用由540名来自27个国家的众包参与者组成的研究，测量了通过DALL.E 2和稳定扩散模型生成的常见名词（例如，一座房子）的地理代表性。对于故意未指定国家名称的输入，生成的图像最反映美国和印度等国家的环境，而最好的生成很少反映其他国家的环境（在25个国家中平均得分不到9%）。对于明确提到一个国家的输入，模型生成高度特定于该国家的图像，具有最少的跨国转移。我们的工作表明，在设计这些模型时需要更多地关注地理多样性，同时要认识到这些模型在准确反映世界方面的局限性。",
