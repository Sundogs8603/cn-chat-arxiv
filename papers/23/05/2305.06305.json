    "translated_abstract": "实例分割在许多机器人应用中都是一项基本的技能。本文提出了一种自监督方法，使用抓取交互来收集一个实例分割模型的分割监督。当机器人抓取物品时，可以从抓取前和抓取后的图像中推断出抓取物品的掩码。利用这个观点，我们学习了一个抓取分割模型，用于从抓取前和抓取后的图像中分割出抓取的物体。这样的模型可以从数千个抓取交互中分割出抓取的对象，而不需要昂贵的人工注释。利用分割出的抓取对象，我们可以“剪切”物体从原始场景中，并将它们“粘贴”到新的场景中来生成实例监督。我们证明，与传统的图像减法方法相比，我们的抓取分割模型在分割抓取对象时提供了5倍的误差降低。结合我们的“剪切和粘贴”生成方法，训练使用我们方法的实例分割模型可以达到与完全监督实例分割数据集训练的模型相当或更优的性能。",
