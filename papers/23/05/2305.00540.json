    "translated_abstract": "高质量的网格生成是精确有限元分析的基础。由于巨大的内部顶点搜索空间和复杂的初始边界，对于复杂的域进行网格生成需要大量手动处理，并长期被认为是整个建模和分析过程中最具挑战性和耗时的瓶颈。在本文中，我们提出了一个名为“SRL辅助AFM”的新型计算框架，通过结合前进法和选择参考点和使用“策略网络”更新前沿边界的神经网络来网格化平面几何。这些深度神经网络使用独特的管道进行训练，将监督学习与强化学习相结合，以迭代地提高网格质量。首先，我们通过在一个正方形域中随机采样点并按顺序连接它们来生成不同的初始边界。这些边界用于获取输入网格并提取训练数据。",
