The adaptive iteration strategy uses larger convolution kernels with fewer iteration times, reducing network depth and increasing training stability while maintaining the accuracy of the planning process.

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对值迭代网络（VIN）在处理更大的输入地图，减轻由增加迭代次数引起的累积误差的挑战提出了一种新方法——具有门控汇总模块的值迭代网络（GS-VIN）。我们提出自适应迭代策略，利用更大的卷积核减少迭代次数，减少网络深度，提高训练稳定性，同时保持计划过程的准确性。我们还引入了门控汇总模块，使得网络可以强调整个规划过程，而不仅仅依赖于最终的全局规划结果。",
