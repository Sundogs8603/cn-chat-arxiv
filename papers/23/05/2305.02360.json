    "translated_abstract": "在互联网上，消费者暴露于多个领域的广告中，如时尚、美容、汽车、食品等等。与此同时，时尚是第二大电子商务购物类别。消费者在各种时尚广告图片上的数字记录行为是否能透露出他们的时尚品味？来自其他领域的广告是否也能推断出他们的时尚品味？本文研究广告和时尚品味之间的相关性。为此，我们引入了一个新的数据集Fashionpedia-Ads，该数据集要求受试者提供对广告（时尚、美容、汽车和甜点）以及时尚产品（社交网络和电子商务款式）图像的偏好。此外，我们从多个角度（抽象级别、物理级别、标题和品牌）全面收集并注释广告图像上的情感、视觉和文本信息。我们开源了Fashionpedia-Ads，以便未来的研究，并鼓励更多的可解释性研究方法。",
