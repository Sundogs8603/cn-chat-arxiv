Experimental results with four baselines show that HyHTM can better attend to parent-child relationships among topics. HyHTM produces coherent topic hierarchies that specialise in granularity from generic higher-level topics to specific lowerlevel topics.

    "translated_abstract": "层次主题模型对于发现文档集合中的主题层次结构非常有用。然而，传统的层次主题模型常常产生低层次主题与其高层次主题无关且不够具体的层次结构。此外，这些方法计算成本较高。我们提出了一种名为 HyHTM 的双曲几何层次主题模型，通过将双曲几何中的层次信息纳入主题模型中，显式地建模主题层次结构，从而解决了这些限制。与四个基线做实验结果表明，HyHTM 可以更好地关注主题之间父子关系。HyHTM 产生连贯的主题层次结构，从通用的高层次主题到具体的低层次主题。此外，我们的模型计算速度更快，内存占用更小。我们已经公开了算法的源代码。",
