    "translated_abstract": "通过内核可以将先验有关潜在函数的信念纳入高斯过程(GP)中以形成归纳偏置，但除了内核选择外，GP模型的决策过程仍然很难理解。本文利用物理学方法对GP模型的损失景观进行了分析，演示了Matern内核的ν连续性，并概述了梯度场关键点的灾变理论方面。通过将ν直接包含在Matern内核的超参数优化中，我们发现，尽管在文献中ν的典型值增加了计算速度，但其在性能方面远非最佳。我们还提供了一种事先评估GP集合效果的方法，并讨论了基于损失景观物理属性的各种投票方法。这些方法的实用性在多种合成和真实数据集上得到了证明。我们的发现提供了对GP模型决策过程的深入理解，并为超参数优化和模型选择提供了新的洞察。",
