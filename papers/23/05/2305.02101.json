    "abstract": "Filled pauses (or fillers), such as \"uh\" and \"um\", are frequent in spontaneous speech and can serve as a turn-holding cue for the listener, indicating that the current speaker is not done yet. In this paper, we use the recently proposed Voice Activity Projection (VAP) model, which is a deep learning model trained to predict the dynamics of conversation, to analyse the effects of filled pauses on the expected turn-hold probability. The results show that, while filled pauses do indeed have a turn-holding effect, it is perhaps not as strong as could be expected, probably due to the redundancy of other cues. We also find that the prosodic properties and position of the filler has a significant effect on the turn-hold probability. However, contrary to what has been suggested in previous work, there is no difference between \"uh\" and \"um\" in this regard.",

    "translated_abstract": "填充停顿（或占位符），例如“嗯”和“啊”，在口语中频繁出现，可以作为听众的持续发言提示，表明当前演讲者尚未完成。本文使用最近提出的Voice Activity Projection（VAP）模型，这是一个深度学习模型，用于预测对话的动态，分析填充停顿对预期持续发言概率的影响。结果表明，虽然填充停顿确实具有持续发言的效果，但可能不像人们预期的那么强烈，这可能是由于其他提示的冗余性。我们还发现，填充物的韵律特性和位置对持续发言的概率有重要影响。然而，与先前的研究所提出的不同，这方面“嗯”和“啊”没有区别。",
