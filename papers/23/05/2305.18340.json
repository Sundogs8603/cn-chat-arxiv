    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT是一个由人工智能驱动的聊天机器人，其用户获取和普及性的指数增长，伴随着广泛的主流媒体报道。本文通过对与ChatGPT和人工智能主题相关的10,902条主流新闻标题语料进行文本挖掘和NLP方法的定量数据分析，呈现出早期趋势和情感的发现。情感分析的结果显示，ChatGPT和人工智能在主流媒体中的好感度高于反感度。关于词频结果，65%以上的高频词集中在大型科技问题和行为者上，而就业、多样性、伦理、版权、性别和女性等主题则表现不足或完全缺失，仅占总语料的6%。本文是对主流媒体报道ChatGPT和人工智能的权力结构进行的批判性分析，并强调在人工智能领域需要更加多元和细致的媒体发言。",
