    "translated_abstract": "根本原因分析（RCA）的任务是分析系统监控数据，以识别系统故障/失效的根本原因。有效的RCA可以大大加速系统故障恢复，并减轻系统损失或财务损失。然而，以前的研究大多集中在开发离线RCA算法上，这通常需要手动启动RCA过程，需要大量时间和数据来训练稳健的模型，然后需要从头开始重新训练新的系统故障。在本文中，我们提出了CORAL，一种新颖的在线RCA框架，可以自动触发RCA过程并增量更新RCA模型。CORAL包括触发点检测、增量解缠因果图学习和基于网络传播的根本原因定位。触发点检测组件旨在自动检测系统状态转换并进行准实时检测。为此，我们开发了一种基于m的在线触发点检测方法。",
