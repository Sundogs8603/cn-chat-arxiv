Three different cases have been studied to derive: i) a basis from a self-adjoint tensor operator; ii) a rank-1 basis; iii) a basis in a subspace. In particular, the equivalence between eigenvalue equation for a real self-adjoint tensor operator and standard matrix eigenvalue equation has been proven.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种张量PCA的数学框架，该方法能够克服以前通过迭代求解优化问题来提取低维子空间的方法的局限性。该方法的核心是从实自伴张量算子中导出张量空间中的基础，从而将基础的导出问题转化为特征值问题。本文研究了三种不同情况的导出：i）从自伴张量算子中导出基础；ii）导出秩为1的基础；iii）从子空间中导出基础。特别是，证明了实自伴张量算子的特征值方程与标准矩阵特征值方程的等价性。针对所考虑的三种情况，采用了子空间方法来导出张量PCA。基于图像数据集的实验验证了所提出的数学框架。",
