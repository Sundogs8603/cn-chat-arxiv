    "translated_abstract": "近年来，语音技术日益普及。 然而，不同语言的准确性，和因此产生的体验，差异显著，这使得技术不够包容。不同语言的数据可用性是影响准确性的关键因素之一，尤其是在训练全神经端到端自动语音识别系统时。跨语言知识转移和迭代伪标记是两种已被证明成功提高ASR系统准确性的技术，特别适用于像乌克兰语这样的低资源语言。我们的目标是训练一个全神经Transducer基础ASR系统，以替换没有手动注释训练数据的DNN-HMM混合系统。我们表明，使用混合系统产生的转录文本训练的Transducer系统在词错误率方面实现了18%的降低。然而，使用相关语言的跨语言知识转移和迭代伪标记的组合，则进一步提高了ASR系统的性能。",
