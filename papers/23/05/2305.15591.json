    "translated_abstract": "在终身学习 (LL) 中，代理人在遇到新条件和任务时不断学习。大多数当前的 LL 仅限于单个代理程序按顺序学习任务。然后部署专用 LL 机器来减轻旧任务的遗忘，因此这是基本上缓慢的。我们提出了一个新的共享知识终身学习 (SKILL) 挑战，它部署分散的 LL 代理程序群，每个代理程序按顺序学习不同的任务，所有代理程序独立并并行运行。在学习了各自的任务后，代理程序通过分散的通信网络共享和 consol 他们的知识，以便最终所有代理程序都可以掌握所有任务。我们提出了一种解决 SKILL 的方法，使用轻量级生命周期学习 (LLL) 代理人，其目标是通过将代理程序的专业化分数最小化来促进有效的共享。因此，每个 LLL 代理程序都包括一个通用任务不可变部分。",
