    "translated_abstract": "自然目标函数和任务通常表现为分层模块化，可以将其分解为更简单的子函数以分层组织。这些子函数具有两个重要特征：它们有一组不同的输入（输入可分离性），并且在更高层次中作为输入被重用（可重复使用性）。以往的研究已经确立了分层模块化神经网络的优点，包括学习效率、泛化、多任务学习和可转移性。但是，对于给定的任务，如何识别潜在的子函数及其分层结构仍然具有挑战性。本文提出了一种名为“神经雕塑”的方法，该方法涉及神经网络的修剪和分析生成的图形结构，以揭示子函数的层次结构。我们在几个基准布尔任务上证明了神经雕塑的有效性，并表明它可以准确地识别任务的潜在模块化结构。此外，我们证明，修剪后的网络具有更好的泛化能力，更容易被人类解释。我们的方法也可以扩展到现实任务中，为复杂问题的潜在模块化结构提供洞察。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a method called \"Neural Sculpting\" which prunes neural networks and analyzes the resulting graph structure to uncover the hierarchically modular structure of tasks. The method is validated on benchmark Boolean tasks and has potential for application in real-world tasks."
