    "translated_abstract": "近期的研究实验证明，我们可以在非欧几里得度量空间中实现有效且高效的图嵌入，旨在获得在度量空间中反映图结构的顶点表示。特别地，在双曲空间中的图嵌入在嵌入具有分层树结构的图上，例如自然语言、社交网络和知识库中的数据，已经获得了实验成功。然而，最近的理论分析显示，非欧几里得图嵌入的泛化误差比欧几里得图嵌入的误差上限要高得多，高泛化误差表明数据中的不完整性和噪声可能会显著损坏学习性能。这意味着现有的界限不能保证实际训练数据规模下在非欧几里得度量空间中的图嵌入成功，这可能会阻止非欧几里得图嵌入在实际问题中的应用。本文提供了一个新的非欧几里得度量空间中图嵌入的泛化误差上限，该上限紧凑且快速，可以保证在实际训练数据规模下非欧几里得图嵌入的成功。",
