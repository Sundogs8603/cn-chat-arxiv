    "abstract": "Existing datasets for automated fact-checking have substantial limitations, such as relying on artificial claims, lacking annotations for evidence and intermediate reasoning, or including evidence published after the claim. In this paper we introduce AVeriTeC, a new dataset of 4,568 real-world claims covering fact-checks by 50 different organizations. Each claim is annotated with question-answer pairs supported by evidence available online, as well as textual justifications explaining how the evidence combines to produce a verdict. Through a multi-round annotation process, we avoid common pitfalls including context dependence, evidence insufficiency, and temporal leakage, and reach a substantial inter-annotator agreement of $\\kappa=0.619$ on verdicts. We develop a baseline as well as an evaluation scheme for verifying claims through several question-answering steps against the open web.",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的自动事实检查数据集存在重大局限性，例如依赖人工主张、缺乏证据和中间推理注释，或包括发布主张后的证据。在本文中，我们介绍了 AVeriTeC，这是一个新的数据集，包括 4,568 个真实世界的主张，涵盖了50个不同组织的事实检查。每个主张都用在线可用证据支持的问题-答案对进行注释，以及文本的证明解释证据如何相互结合产生结论。通过多轮注释过程，我们避免了常见的问题，包括上下文依赖性、证据不足和时间泄漏，并在结论上达成了相当大的注释员协议 $\\kappa=0.619$。我们开发了一个基线以及一个方法来验证通过对开放网络进行几个问题回答步骤来检查主张。",
