    "abstract": "Data augmentation is a prevalent technique for improving performance in various machine learning applications. We propose SeqAug, a modality-agnostic augmentation method that is tailored towards sequences of extracted features. The core idea of SeqAug is to augment the sequence by resampling from the underlying feature distribution. Resampling is performed by randomly selecting feature dimensions and permuting them along the temporal axis. Experiments on CMU-MOSEI verify that SeqAug is modality agnostic; it can be successfully applied to a single modality or multiple modalities. We further verify its compatibility with both recurrent and transformer architectures, and also demonstrate comparable to state-of-the-art results.",

    "translated_abstract": "数据增强是提高各种机器学习应用性能的常用技术。本文提出了SeqAug，一种针对从序列中提取的特征的模态不可知的增强方法。SeqAug的核心思想是通过从基础特征分布中重新采样来增强序列。重新采样通过随机选择特征维度并沿时间轴对它们进行置换来实现。在CMU-MOSEI上的实验验证了SeqAug的模态不可知性；它可以成功地应用于单模态或多模态。我们进一步验证了它与循环和Transformer架构的兼容性，并证明了它具有与最先进结果相当的性能。",
