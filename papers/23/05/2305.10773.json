    "translated_abstract": "近年来，多模通信系统对带宽的需求不断增加，需要一种新的思路。基于深度学习的语义通信被应用于多模场景中，以提高通信效率和节省通信资源。然而，不带信道编码器/解码器的现有端到端神经网络（NN）框架与现代数字通信系统不兼容。大多数端到端设计是针对特定任务的，需要为新任务重新设计和重新训练，这限制了它们的应用。本文提出了一种分布式多模语义通信框架，其中包括传统的信道编码器/解码器。我们采用基于NN的语义编码器和解码器来提取不同模态（包括语音、文本和图像）中包含的相关语义信息。基于所提出的框架，我们进一步建立了一种适用于各种类型的多模自适应编码机制。",
