    "translated_abstract": "在代理人群体中研究符号的出现和紧急通信，使用了一种计算模型，其中代理人参与各种语言游戏。其中，Metropolis-Hastings 命名游戏 (MHNG) 具有一个显著的数学属性：通过 MHNG 的符号出现被证明是分散式贝叶斯推理，是代理人共享的表征。然而，以前提出的 MHNG 仅在两个代理人场景中使用。本文将 MHNG 扩展到 N 代理人场景中。本文的主要贡献有两个：(1) 我们将递归 Metropolis-Hastings 命名游戏 (RMHNG) 提出为 MHNG 的 N 代理人版本，并证明 RMHNG 是一种近似贝叶斯推理方法，类似于 MHNG，用于代理人共享的潜在变量的后验分布；(2) 我们在合成和真实图像数据上进行了 RMHNG 的性能实证评估，使多个代理可以开发和共享符号系统。此外，我们还将 RMHNG 的性能与其他现有模型进行了比较，并展示了其在收敛速度和鲁棒性方面的优越性。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a Recursive Metropolis-Hastings Naming Game (RMHNG) for symbol emergence in multi-agent systems, and demonstrates its superiority over existing models in terms of convergence speed and robustness. The empirical evaluation of RMHNG on synthetic and real image data shows its effectiveness in enabling multiple agents to develop and share a symbol system."
