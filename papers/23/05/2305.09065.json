    "translated_abstract": "一个卖家想要将商品卖给$n$个买家，买家的估值是独立同分布的，但是卖家并不知道这个分布。为了抵御环境和买家行为的不确定性，卖家在DSIC机制中进行优化，并将最坏情况的表现与具有完全买家估值知识的oracle进行比较。我们的分析包括遗憾和比率两个目标。对于这些目标，我们以支持和买家数$n$的函数形式导出了一个闭合的最优机制。我们的分析揭示了三个支持信息的区域和一个新的鲁棒机制类。",

It reveals three regimes of support information and a new class of robust mechanisms, and derives an optimal mechanism in closed form for both regret and ratio objectives."
