However, unlike biological neural networks, traditional artificial neural networks are often structured hierarchically, which can impede the flow of information between neurons as the neurons in the same layer have no connections between them. Hence, we propose a more robust model of artificial neural networks where the hidden neurons, residing in the same hidden layer, are interconnected, enabling the neurons to learn complex patterns and speeding up the convergence rate. With the experimental study of our proposed model as fully connected layers in shallow and deep networks, we demonstrate that the model results in a significant increase in convergence rate.",

    "translated_abstract": "人工神经网络的核心目的是模仿生物神经网络的功能。然而，与生物神经网络不同，传统的人工神经网络通常是按层次结构化的，这可能会妨碍神经元之间的信息流动，因为同一层中的神经元之间没有连接。因此，我们提出了一种更为强大的人工神经网络模型，其中同一隐藏层中的隐藏神经元是互相连接的，使得神经元能够学习复杂的模式并加速收敛速度。通过在浅层和深层网络中将我们提出的模型作为完全连接的层进行实验研究，我们证明这个模型可以显著提高收敛速率。",
