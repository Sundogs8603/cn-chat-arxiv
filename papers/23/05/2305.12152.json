    "abstract": "Topic models are used to make sense of large text collections. However, automatically evaluating topic model output and determining the optimal number of topics both have been longstanding challenges, with no effective automated solutions to date. This paper proposes using large language models to evaluate such output. We find that large language models appropriately assess the resulting topics, correlating more strongly with human judgments than existing automated metrics. We then investigate whether we can use large language models to automatically determine the optimal number of topics. We automatically assign labels to documents and choosing configurations with the most pure labels returns reasonable values for the optimal number of topics.",

    "translated_abstract": "主题模型用于对大型文本集合进行分析。然而，自动评估主题模型输出和确定最佳主题数量一直是长期的挑战，目前尚无有效的自动化解决方案。本文提出使用大型语言模型来评估这种输出。我们发现，相比现有的自动度量标准，大型语言模型更能适当地评估出产生的主题，并且更能与人类判断相关。然后，我们研究能否利用大型语言模型自动确定最佳的主题数量。我们自动为文档分配标签，并选择具有最纯净标签的配置，以返回合理的最佳主题数量值。",
