    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型的出色生成性能，关于使用它们的道德和法律问题日益受到关注，如抄袭和版权问题。为了应对这些问题，最近提出了几种用于水印和检测LLM生成文本的方法。然而，我们发现先前的方法由于代码的句法和语义特征，无法有效地应用于代码生成任务。基于Kirchenbauer等人的研究，我们提出了一种新的水印方法，名为Selective WatErmarking via Entropy Thresholding（SWEET），该方法仅在生成期间将“绿色”令牌放置在具有高熵的令牌分布位置，从而保留生成代码的正确性。水印代码通过基于熵信息的统计测试和Z分数进行检测。我们在HumanEval和MBPP上的实验表明，SWEET显著改善了生成代码的质量。",
