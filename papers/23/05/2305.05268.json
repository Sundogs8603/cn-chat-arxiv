    "abstract": "In this paper we address the rotation synchronization problem, where the objective is to recover absolute rotations starting from pairwise ones, where the unknowns and the measures are represented as nodes and edges of a graph, respectively. This problem is an essential task for structure from motion and simultaneous localization and mapping. We focus on the formulation of synchronization via neural networks, which has only recently begun to be explored in the literature. Inspired by deep matrix completion, we express rotation synchronization in terms of matrix factorization with a deep neural network. Our formulation exhibits implicit regularization properties and, more importantly, is unsupervised, whereas previous deep approaches are supervised. Our experiments show that we achieve comparable accuracy to the closest competitors in most scenes, while working under weaker assumptions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对旋转同步问题展开研究，该问题的目标是从成对的旋转中恢复绝对旋转，其中未知数和测量值分别表示为图的节点和边。该问题是结构从运动和同时定位和映射的重要任务。我们专注于通过神经网络公式化同步问题，这项工作在最近的文献中才开始探索。受到深度矩阵补全的启发，我们将旋转同步表示为具有深度神经网络的矩阵分解。我们的公式具有隐式正则化属性，更重要的是，它是无监督的，而先前的深度方法是受监督的。我们的实验表明，我们在大多数情况下实现了与最接近的竞争对手相当的准确性，在较弱的假设下工作。",
