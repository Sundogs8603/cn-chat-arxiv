    "translated_abstract": "从离散时间事件序列中学习事件类型之间的因果结构是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务。现有的方法，如基于多元Hawkes过程的方法，大多都归结为学习所谓的Granger因果关系，它假定因果事件在效应事件之前严格发生。这种假设在低分辨率离散时间事件序列中往往是不可行的；而典型的离散Hawkes过程主要受到瞬时效应引起的可识别性问题的困扰，即由于低分辨率数据而同时发生的因果关系不会被Granger因果性所捕捉。在本文中，我们提出了一种结构Hawkes过程（SHPs），利用瞬时效应来学习离散事件序列中事件类型之间的因果结构。所提出的方法具有最小化-最大化似然函数的特点。",
