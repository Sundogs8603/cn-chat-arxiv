    "translated_abstract": "在各种区域嵌入方法中，基于图的区域关系学习模型由于使用图神经网络编码空间相关性的强大结构表示能力而脱颖而出。尽管它们很有效，但现有方法尚未解决几个关键挑战：i）由于各种因素，数据噪音和缺失在许多时空场景中是普遍存在的。ii）输入的时空数据（例如移动轨迹）通常在空间和时间上表现出分布异质性。在这种情况下，当前方法容易受到生成区域图的质量的影响，从而可能导致次优性能。本文通过探索从多视图数据源生成的异构区域图上的自动时空图对比学习范式（AutoST）来解决上述挑战。我们的\"AutoST\"框架建立在一个异构图神经架构之上，以捕捉多视图区域依赖关系。",
