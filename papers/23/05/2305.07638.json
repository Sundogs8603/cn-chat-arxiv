    "translated_abstract": "低秩谱最优化问题（LSOP）的目标是在低秩和谱约束的可行域内，最小化一个线性目标，满足多个双面线性矩阵不等式的交集。虽然解决LSOP在一般情况下是NP难的，但它的部分凸化（即用凸壳代替域集合），称为“LSOP-R”，通常是可处理的并产生高质量的解。这激励我们研究LSOP-R的实力。具体而言，我们为LSOP-R可行集的任何极端点派生秩界，并证明对于不同矩阵空间的域集合，它们的紧致性。所提出的秩界从新的角度恢复了文献中的两个众所周知的结果，并允许我们导出当松弛LSOP-R等价于原始LSOP的充分条件。为了有效地解决LSOP-R，我们开发了一个包含矢量凸定价神谕的列生成算法，配合一个秩降算法，它确保输出一个LSOP-R的准确解。",
