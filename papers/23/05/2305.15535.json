    "abstract": "Humans have developed the capability to teach relevant aspects of new or adapted tasks to a social peer with very few task demonstrations by making use of scaffolding strategies that leverage prior knowledge and importantly prior joint experience to yield a joint understanding and a joint execution of the required steps to solve the task. This process has been discovered and analyzed in parent-infant interaction and constitutes a ``co-construction'' as it allows both, the teacher and the learner, to jointly contribute to the task. We propose to focus research in robot interactive learning on this co-construction process to enable robots to learn from non-expert users in everyday situations. In the following, we will review current proposals for interactive task learning and discuss their main contributions with respect to the entailing interaction. We then discuss our notion of co-construction and summarize research insights from adult-child and human-robot interactions to elucidate it",

    "translated_abstract": "人类通过利用支架策略，以很少的任务演示次数，将新任务或适应任务的相关方面教给社交伙伴，并利用先前的知识和重要的先前联合体验产生共同理解和共同执行所需的步骤。这一过程已经在父母幼儿互动中被发现和分析，并构成“共同建构”，因为它允许教师和学习者共同为任务做出贡献。我们建议将机器人交互学习的研究重点放在这种共同建构过程上，以使机器人能够在日常情况下从非专家用户那里学习。接下来，我们将审查当前的交互式任务学习提案，并讨论它们在涉及互动方面的主要贡献。然后，我们将讨论我们关于协同构建的概念，并总结来自成年人-孩子和人机交互的研究洞见，以阐明它。",
