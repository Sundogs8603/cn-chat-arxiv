Specifically, these agents must infer personas of their listeners to produce statements that cater to their interests. They must also learn to maintain consistent speaker personas for themselves throughout the narrative, so that their counterparts feel involved in a realistic conversation or story.  However, personas are diverse and complex: they entail large quantities of rich interconnected world knowledge that is challenging to robustly represent in general narrative systems (e.g., a singer is good at singing, and may have attended conservatoire).

    "translated_abstract": "维持一致且引人入胜的叙述需要对话或故事代理人理解说话者或听众的角色如何与叙述相关联。具体来说，这些代理人必须推断他们听众的角色，以产生符合他们兴趣的陈述。他们还必须学习在整个叙述中保持一致的说话者角色，以便他们的对等方感到参与其中并且是一段逼真的对话或故事。然而，角色是多样化和复杂的：它们包含大量丰富的相互关联的世界知识，这对于强大的一般叙述系统而言是具有挑战性的（例如，歌手擅长唱歌，并可能曾参加过音乐学院）。在这项工作中，我们构建了一个新的大规模角色常识知识图PeaCoK，其中包含约10万个经过人类验证的角色事实。我们的知识图表现了在以前的人类交互行为研究中确定的五个角色知识维度，并区分了常识和情感层面。",
