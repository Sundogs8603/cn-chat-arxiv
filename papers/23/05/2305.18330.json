    "translated_abstract": "在许多在线社交网络系统中，自动评估hashtag推荐模型是一项基本任务。传统的评估方法是首先比较算法推荐的hashtag与实际的hashtag的精确对应关系，然后使用精确匹配的数量计算命中率、命中比率、精确度、召回率或F1分数。然而，这种评估方式忽略了推荐和实际hashtag之间的语义相关性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的语义评估框架#REval，它包括一个称为BERTag的内部模块，可自动学习hashtag嵌入。我们使用提出的#REval-hit-ratio度量标准，研究了#REval框架在不同的词嵌入方法和推荐中的同义词和hashtag数量下的性能。在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，我们提出的框架在捕捉推荐和实际hashtag之间的语义相关性方面是有效的。",
