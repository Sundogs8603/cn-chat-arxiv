    "translated_abstract": "抗体是由免疫系统产生的针对外来物质或抗原的重要蛋白质。抗体的特异性由其互补决定区（CDR）决定，CDR位于抗体链的可变区域中，形成与抗原结合的位点。以往的研究利用复杂的技术生成CDR，但它们遭受了几何建模不足的问题。此外，常见的迭代精化策略导致了低效的推断。本文提出了一种深度生成模型，可以一次性地共同设计CDR的1D序列和3D结构。为了实现这一目标，我们将抗体CDR设计分为两个阶段：（i）蛋白质结构的几何建模和（ii）序列结构共学习。我们开发了一种蛋白质复合物不变嵌入，可捕捉蛋白质骨架原子（包括Cα、N、C和O原子）之间的内部和外部组分相互作用，以实现全面的几何建模。",
