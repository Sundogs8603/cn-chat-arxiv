    "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress in text-to-SQL semantic parsing in recent years, the performance of existing parsers is still far from perfect. At the same time, modern deep learning based text-to-SQL parsers are often over-confident and thus casting doubt on their trustworthiness when deployed for real use. To that end, we propose to build a parser-independent error detection model for text-to-SQL semantic parsing. The proposed model is based on pre-trained language model of code and is enhanced with structural features learned by graph neural networks. We train our model on realistic parsing errors collected from a cross-domain setting. Experiments with three strong text-to-SQL parsers featuring different decoding mechanisms show that our approach outperforms parser-dependent uncertainty metrics and could effectively improve the performance and usability of text-to-SQL semantic parsers regardless of their architectures.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管近年来文本到SQL语义解析取得了显著进展，但现有解析器的性能仍远非完美。同时，现代基于深度学习的文本到SQL解析器往往过于自信，因此在实际使用时对其可靠性产生怀疑。基于此，我们提出了一种独立于解析器的文本到SQL语义解析的误差检测模型。该模型基于代码的预训练语言模型，并利用图神经网络学习到的结构特征进行增强。我们在跨领域设置中收集的实际解析误差上训练我们的模型。针对具有不同解码机制的三种强大的文本到SQL解析器的实验表明，我们的方法优于解析器依赖的不确定性度量，并且可以有效地提高解析器的性能和可用性，而不考虑其架构。",
