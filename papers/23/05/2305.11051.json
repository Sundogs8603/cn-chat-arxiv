    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人们对水和健康资源的管理越来越感兴趣。这种兴趣源于全球可持续发展所面临的挑战，水资源的稀缺性和质量成为了其中的核心问题。因此，有效、有意义和开放的数据的可用性对于解决这些问题至关重要，这些问题是联合国所制定的清洁水和卫生可持续发展目标的一部分。本文介绍了水健康开放知识图谱（WHOW-KG）及其设计方法和影响分析。WHOW-KG是一个语义化知识图谱，可对水的消耗、污染、传染病率和药品分布等数据进行建模。WHOW-KG是在欧盟资助的WHOW（水健康开放知识）项目的框架下开发的，旨在支持广泛的应用：从知识发现到决策制定，使其成为研究人员、政策制定者和从业人员一个宝贵的资源。",
