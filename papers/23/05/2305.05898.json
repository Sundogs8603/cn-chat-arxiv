However, many established algorithms can only perform well during the learning paradigm but exhibit poor generalization during cooperation with other unseen partners. The personality theory in cognitive psychology describes that humans can well handle the above cooperation challenge by predicting others' personalities first and then their complex actions. Inspired by this two-step psychology theory, we propose a biologically plausible mixture of personality (MoP) improved spiking actor network (SAN), whereby a determinantal point process is used to simulate the complex formation and integration of different types of personality in MoP, and dynamic and spiking neurons are incorporated into the SAN for the efficient reinforcement learning.
