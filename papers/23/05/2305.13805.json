    "translated_abstract": "网页数量的快速增长及其结构的日益复杂化对 Web 挖掘模型提出了挑战。这些模型需要理解半结构化的网页，特别是在对新网页的主题或模板知之甚少的情况下。目前的方法通过将 XML 源代码嵌入到 transformer 或使用图神经网络对呈现的布局进行编码，将语言模型迁移到 Web 挖掘领域。然而，这些方法并没有考虑网页内部和跨页面的文本节点之间的关系。本文提出一种新的方法 ReXMiner，用于实现 Web 挖掘中的零样本关系抽取。ReXMiner 编码文档对象模型（DOM）树中的最短相对路径，这种方法对于网页内的键值对提取来说更加准确和有效。它还通过计算相同文本节点在不同网页中出现的次数，来反映每个文本节点的流行程度。",
