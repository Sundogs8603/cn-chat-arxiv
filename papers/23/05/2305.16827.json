    "translated_abstract": "宏观经济模型（如向量自回归（VAR））中的冲击可能是非高斯的，表现出不对称性和重尾特征。这一考虑推动了在本文中开发的VAR模型，该模型使用狄利克雷过程混合（DPM）来对冲击进行建模。然而，我们不遵循显而易见的策略，即只是用DPM建模VAR误差，因为这会导致在较大的VAR中进行计算困难的贝叶斯推断，并可能对VAR中变量的排序方式敏感。相反，我们开发了一种特定的加性误差结构，受面板数据模型中随机效应的贝叶斯非参数处理的启发。我们展示了这会导致一个模型，该模型允许在具有非参数冲击的大型VAR中进行计算快速且顺序不变的推断。我们在具有不同维度的非参数VAR上进行的实证结果表明，VAR误差的非参数处理在金融等时期特别有用。",
