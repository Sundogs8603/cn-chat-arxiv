    "abstract": "This paper introduces a non-native speech corpus consisting of narratives from fifty 5- to 6-year-old Chinese-English children. Transcripts totaling 6.5 hours of children taking a narrative comprehension test in English (L2) are presented, along with human-rated scores and annotations of grammatical and pronunciation errors. The children also completed the parallel MAIN tests in Chinese (L1) for reference purposes. For all tests we recorded audio and video with our innovative self-developed remote collection methods. The video recordings serve to mitigate the challenge of low intelligibility in L2 narratives produced by young children during the transcription process. This corpus offers valuable resources for second language teaching and has the potential to enhance the overall performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR).",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一份非母语语音语料库，包含了来自50位5-6岁的中英双语儿童的叙述。提供了总计6.5小时的英语（L2）叙述理解测试的转录文本，以及评分和语法及发音错误的注释。这些孩子还完成了中文（L1）的平行MAIN测试以便进行参考。对于所有测试，我们记录了音频和视频，并采用了自主开发的远程收集方法。视频记录有助于减轻在转录过程中由年幼儿童的L2叙述低可懂性所带来的难度。该语料库为第二语言教学提供了有价值的资源，并有可能提高自动语音识别（ASR）的整体性能。",
