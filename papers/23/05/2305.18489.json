    "translated_abstract": "最近几个月，原本仅流行于有限世界范围内的猴痘病毒（mpox）开始在多个国家传播，最终被世界卫生组织宣布为“国际关注的公共卫生紧急事件”。由于多个国家存在持续的病例和可能的新爆发，该警报于2023年2月得以更新。特别是那些缺乏疫苗和检测设施的低收入国家，面临着极大的风险。猴痘病毒感染的症状之一是皮疹和爆发的出现，这可能会促使人们寻求医疗建议。一种可能帮助根据皮损外观进行初步筛查的技术是使用机器学习进行图像分类，但要使这种技术适用于大规模使用，它应该可以直接在人们的移动设备上使用，并且能通知远程医疗专家。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种使用迁移学习和可解释的方法，以从智能手机图像中检测猴痘病毒。",
