    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）是否拥有人格？简短的回答是“我们不知道！”。本文表明我们还没有合适的工具能够测量语言模型的人格。个性是影响行为的重要特征。随着LLM在各种任务中模拟人类智能和表现，自然而然地问出的一个问题是，这些模型是否拥有了人格。以前的研究通过自我评估人格测试来评估机器人格，这是一组用于评估人类个性的多项选择题。一个基本的假设是，人类个性测试可以准确地测量机器人格。在本文中，我们研究了五个不同尺寸范围（从1.5B到30B）的LLM中的个性浮现。我们提出了选项顺序对称性原则作为这些自我评估测试可靠性的必要条件。在这个条件下，答题和他们的排序不应影响分数。然而，我们发现现有的自我评估个性测试对LLM来说是不可靠的。我们的分析表明，常用的自我评估测试对人类具有偏见，没有考虑到LLM的独特特征。为了促进LLM个性测量的未来研究，我们强调了开发专门为LLM设计的新的自我评估测试的必要性。",

The need for developing new self-assessment tests specifically designed for language models is highlighted."
