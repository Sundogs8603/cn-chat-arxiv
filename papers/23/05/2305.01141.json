    "abstract": "To prevent potential bias in the paper review and selection process for conferences and journals, most include double blind review. Despite this, studies show that bias still exists. Recommendation algorithms for paper review also may have implicit bias. We offer three fair methods that specifically take into account author diversity in paper recommendation to address this. Our methods provide fair outcomes across many protected variables concurrently, in contrast to typical fair algorithms that only use one protected variable. Five demographic characteristics-gender, ethnicity, career stage, university rank, and geolocation-are included in our multidimensional author profiles. The Overall Diversity approach uses a score for overall diversity to rank publications. The Round Robin Diversity technique chooses papers from authors who are members of each protected group in turn, whereas the Multifaceted Diversity method chooses papers that initially fill the demographic feature with the hi",

    "translated_abstract": "为了防止会议和期刊的论文审核和选择过程中出现偏见，大多数会采用双盲审查。尽管如此，研究表明偏见仍然存在。论文审核的推荐算法也可能存在内在的偏差。我们提出了三种公平方法，特别考虑到作者多样性在论文推荐中的作用。与典型的公平算法只使用一个保护变量不同，我们的方法同时提供跨多个受保护变量的公正结果。五个人口统计特征-性别、种族、职业阶段、大学排名和地理位置-被包括在我们的多维作者资料中。总体多样性方法使用整体多样性得分来排名出版物，轮流多样性技术选择依次属于每个受保护团体的作者的论文，而多方面多样性方法选择最初填写族裔特征的论文。",
