    "translated_abstract": "数字化转型在降低成本、提高效率的同时，也给企业的财务管理带来了挑战。在数字化转型的背景下，识别企业财务风险传导路径是亟待解决的问题。本文通过文献研究构建了新时代企业财务风险影响因素体系，并提出了一种基于DEMATEL-ISM-MICMAC的企业数字化转型下财务风险路径识别方法。本文探究了企业财务风险影响因素之间的内在关联，识别了关键的影响因素，梳理了影响因素体系的层次结构，并分析了因素之间的依赖和驱动关系。研究结果表明：（1）政治、经济环境不乐观将制约企业的经营能力，因此是企业财务风险的重要影响因素。（2）企业本身的内部管理问题也是引起财务风险的重要原因。",
