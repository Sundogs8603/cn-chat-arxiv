    "translated_abstract": "任务规划系统已经被开发出来，以帮助机器人利用人类关于行动的知识来完成长时程的任务。大多数系统都是为“封闭世界”而设计的，同时假设机器人提供完整的世界知识。然而，真实世界通常是开放的，机器人经常遇到无法预料的情况，这可能会打破规划器的完整性。我们能否利用最近在预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）方面的进展，使经典规划系统能够处理新的情况？本文介绍了一个称为COWP的开放世界任务规划和情境处理的新框架。COWP动态地增加了机器人的行动知识，包括行动的前提条件和效果，以及面向任务的常识知识。COWP借鉴了LLMs的开放性，并通过行动知识与特定领域相结合。为了系统评估，我们收集了包含1085个执行时情景的数据集。",
