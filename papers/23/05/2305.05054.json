    "translated_abstract": "一致的证据表明，梦的报告在语义内容上与其他类型的文本记录显着不同。此外，梦/睡眠研究界普遍认为，梦的报告构成了相当“独特”的文本字符串。这可能是越来越多的方法使用自然语言处理（NLP）工具来自动分析梦的报告的一个值得注意的问题，因为它们在很大程度上依赖于在网络上爬取的非梦想语料库上训练的神经模型。在本文中，作者将采用最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）来研究梦想报告是否偏离其他人生成的文本字符串（例如维基百科），以及如何偏离。结果表明，DreamBank作为一个整体不偏离维基百科。此外，就平均而言，单个梦报告比维基百科文章更可预测。初步证据表明，字数、性别和视觉障碍可以显著影响梦的可预测性。",
