    "translated_abstract": "近年来，新开发的训练突触神经网络（SNN）的方法已经证明了它们在准确性方面可以作为人工神经网络（ANN）的替代品，同时在推理和潜在的训练时间上都更加节能。然而，对于SNN，什么是一个好的初始化仍然不清楚。我们经常使用为ANN训练开发的初始化方案，这些方案经常是不足的，需要手动调整。在本文中，我们尝试通过使用ANN初始化文献中的技术以及计算神经科学结果来解决这个问题。我们表明，由于SNN的尖峰和重置非线性以及射频崩溃问题，与ANNs相比，ANNs的重量初始化问题更为微妙。我们首先确定并提出了几种解决射频崩溃问题的方案，在不同的假设下成功地解决了这个问题。",
