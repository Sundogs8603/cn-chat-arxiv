    "translated_abstract": "Agent-Based Model是一种强大而直观的复杂系统建模方法。然而，这些模型的似然函数难以计算，其中的数学运算也不可微分，这本质上限制了它们在实际应用中的使用。为此，人们提出了逼近贝叶斯推断方法和构建可微分逼近任意Agent-Based Model的研究，但对于可微分Agent-Based Model的近似贝叶斯推断技术的设计却鲜有研究。本研究旨在填补这一空白，讨论如何采用广义变分推断程序来提供对可微分Agent-Based Model进行鲁棒性贝叶斯参数推断。我们以COVID-19大流行的可微分Agent-Based Model为例进行实验，证明了我们的方法可以得出准确的推断，并讨论了未来工作的方向。",
