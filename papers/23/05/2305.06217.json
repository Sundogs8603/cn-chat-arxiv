    "translated_abstract": "在医疗保健领域中，机器学习（ML）提供了许多增强患者护理、人口健康和医疗保健提供者工作流程的机会。然而，由于数据隐私、异构数据来源和无法充分利用多个数据模态的挑战，现实中的临床和成本效益仍然有限。在这篇观点论文中，我们介绍了“补丁学习”（PL），这是一种新的范式，通过集成来自不同数据来源（例如，临床免费文本、医学图像、组学）和分布在不同安全站点上的不同数据模态的不同数据集的信息来解决这些限制。PL允许同时利用互补的数据来源，同时保护数据隐私，从而实现开发更全面和具有普适性的ML模型。我们介绍了补丁学习的概念以及其在医疗保健领域的当前实现，探讨了解决各种问题的潜在机会和适用数据来源。",
