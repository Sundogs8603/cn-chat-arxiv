    "translated_abstract": "近年来，数据驱动的方法用于远程检测帕金森病及其运动征象，旨在提供早期诊断的潜在临床效益。然而，在日常生活中进行数据收集是难以避免的，同时获取细粒度的标准并不容易。因此，该问题通常通过多实例学习来解决。然而，对于大规模的研究，获取所需的粗略标准并不容易，因为需要进行完整的神经学评估。相比之下，收集没有任何标准的数据要容易得多。然而，在多实例学习中利用无标签数据不是很直观，因为这个领域的研究还很少。本文提出了一种新的方法，通过利用无标签数据与少量标记数据相结合来进行多实例学习，从而诊断帕金森病震颤。在真实的帕金森数据上的实验结果证明了我们的方法在提高自由生活条件下的震颤检测方面的有效性。",
