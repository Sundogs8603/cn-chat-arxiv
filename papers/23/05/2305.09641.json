    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了FitMe，一个人脸反射模型和可微分渲染优化管道，可从单个或多个图像中获取高保真可渲染的人类化身。该模型由多模式基于风格的生成器和基于PCA的形状模型组成，捕捉人脸外观的漫反射和镜面反射。我们采用快速可微分渲染过程，在优化管道中使用，同时实现逼真的面部着色。FitMe在单个“野外”人脸图像上实现了最先进的反射获取和身份保护，并在给定同一身份的多个不受约束的人脸图像时产生了令人印象深刻的扫描效果。与最近改进的方法相比，FitMe可以使用高效的优化过程生成高保真、可渲染的人类化身，准确捕捉人脸反射和形状，同时实现逼真的面部着色。",
