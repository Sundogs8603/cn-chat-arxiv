    "translated_abstract": "生成式隐写术（GS）是一种新兴技术，它直接从秘密数据中生成隐藏信息图像。最近已经开发了基于GAN或Flow的各种GS方法。然而，现有的基于GAN的GS方法由于缺乏网络可逆性，无法完全恢复隐藏的秘密数据，而基于Flow的方法由于每个模块中严格的可逆限制而产生质量较差的图像。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的GS方案，称为“生成式隐写扩散”（GSD），通过设计一种反演扩散模型“StegoDiffusion”来实现。它不仅生成逼真的隐写图像，而且允许100％地恢复隐藏的秘密数据。所提出的StegoDiffusion模型利用非马尔可夫链和快速采样技术实现高效的隐写图像生成。通过根据StegoDiffusion中的生成过程的转移概率构造一个普通微分方程（ODE），秘密数据和隐写信息可以被有效和可逆地嵌入到隐写图像中。实验结果表明了所提出的GSD方案在隐写图像质量和秘密数据恢复性能方面的有效性。",
