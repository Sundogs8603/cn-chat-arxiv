    "abstract": "We present a design framework called Conversational Learning with Analytical Step-by-Step Strategies (CLASS) for building advanced Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) powered by high-performance Large Language Models (LLMs). The CLASS framework empowers ITS with two key capabilities. First, through a carefully curated scaffolding dataset, CLASS equips ITS with essential problem-solving strategies, enabling it to provide tutor-like, step-by-step guidance to students. Second, by using a dynamic conversational dataset, CLASS assists ITS in facilitating natural language interactions, fostering engaging student-tutor conversations. The CLASS framework also provides valuable insights into ITS' internal decision-making process which allows seamless integration of user feedback, thus enabling continuous refinement and improvement. We also present a proof-of-concept ITS, referred to as SPOCK, which is trained using the CLASS framework with a focus on introductory college-level biology content. A",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个名为Conversational Learning with Analytical Step-by-Step Strategies（CLASS）的设计框架，用于构建由高性能大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的先进智能辅导系统（ITS）。CLASS框架赋予ITS两个关键能力。首先，通过一个精心策划的脚手架数据集，CLASS为ITS提供了必要的问题解决策略，使其能够为学生提供类似导师的逐步指导。其次，通过使用动态对话数据集，CLASS帮助ITS促进自然语言交互，促进有趣的学生-导师对话。CLASS框架还提供了对ITS内部决策过程的宝贵洞察，从而实现了用户反馈的无缝集成，实现持续的完善和改进。我们还展示了一个名为SPOCK的概念验证ITS，它是使用CLASS框架并专注于大学初级生物学内容进行训练的。",
