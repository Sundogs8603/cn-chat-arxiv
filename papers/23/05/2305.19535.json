    "abstract": "We propose an efficient online approximate Bayesian inference algorithm for estimating the parameters of a nonlinear function from a potentially non-stationary data stream. The method is based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF), but uses a novel low-rank plus diagonal decomposition of the posterior precision matrix, which gives a cost per step which is linear in the number of model parameters. In contrast to methods based on stochastic variational inference, our method is fully deterministic, and does not require step-size tuning. We show experimentally that this results in much faster (more sample efficient) learning, which results in more rapid adaptation to changing distributions, and faster accumulation of reward when used as part of a contextual bandit algorithm.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种高效的在线近似贝叶斯推理算法，用于从可能非平稳的数据流中估计非线性函数的参数。该方法基于扩展卡尔曼滤波器（EKF），但使用了一种新颖的低秩加对角线的后验精度矩阵分解，其每步的成本与模型参数数量成线性关系。与基于随机变分推理的方法不同，我们的方法是完全确定的，并且不需要步长调整。我们通过实验证明，这导致更快（更高效）的学习，从而在用作上下文赌博算法的一部分时实现更快速的适应性和更快的奖励积累。",
