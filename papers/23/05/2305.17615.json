    "translated_abstract": "在处理内生性时，经济学家经常实施TSLS。当工具变量数量众多时，TSLS偏倚很严重。因此，JIVE被提出来减少超识别的TSLS偏差。但是，这两种方法都有重大缺陷。当超识别度较高时，超定TSLS偏差很大，而JIVE不稳定。在本文中，我将TSLS和JIVE的优化问题桥接起来，解决了连接问题，并提出了一种新的估计器TSJI。TSJI具有用户定义的参数λ。通过将TSJI偏差近似到op（1/N）的方式，我找到了一个产生近似无偏TSJI的λ值。选择了具有所选λ值的TSJI不仅具有在第一阶段和第二阶段回归器数量固定时与TSLS相同的一阶分布，而且在许多工具变量渐进情况下是一致且渐进正常的。在三种不同的模拟设置下，我使用不同力度的工具测试了TSJI与TSLS和JIVE。",
