    "translated_abstract": "最近推出了大型语言模型(LLM)的聊天机器人，如ChatGPT，这引起了人们对基础模型的广泛关注。基础模型被广泛认为将成为未来人工智能系统的基石。由于基础模型处于早期阶段，基于基础模型的系统设计尚未得到系统地探索。人们对在软件架构中引入基础模型的影响知之甚少。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一个基于基础模型的系统分类法，对基础模型和基于基础模型的系统的特点进行了分类和比较。我们的分类法包括三个类别：基础模型预训练和微调、基于基础模型的系统架构设计和负责任的AI设计。这个分类法为设计基于基础模型的系统时做出主要的设计决策提供了具体的指导，并突出了相关的权衡。",
