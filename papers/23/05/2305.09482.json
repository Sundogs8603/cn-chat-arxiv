    "abstract": "The aim of this research paper is to look into the use of continuous authentication with mobile touch dynamics, using three different algorithms: Neural Network, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine. Mobile devices are constantly increasing in popularity in the world, today smartphone subscriptions have surpassed 6 billion. Mobile touch dynamics refer to the distinct patterns of how a user interacts with their mobile device, this includes factors such as touch pressure, swipe speed, and touch duration. Continuous authentication refers to the process of continuously verifying a user's identity while they are using a device, rather than just at the initial login. This research used a dataset of touch dynamics collected from 40 subjects using the LG V30+. The participants played four mobile games, PUBG, Diep.io, Slither, and Minecraft, for 10 minutes each game. The three algorithms were trained and tested on the extracted dataset, and their performance was evaluated based",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在探究使用移动触摸动态进行连续认证的可行性，使用神经网络、极端梯度提升和支持向量机三种不同的算法进行实验。移动设备在世界范围内的普及率不断提升，目前智能手机的订阅量已经超过了60亿。移动触摸动态是指用户与移动设备交互的特定模式，包括触摸的压力、滑动速度和触摸的持续时间等因素。连续认证是指在用户使用设备时持续验证其身份，而不仅仅是在初始登录时进行身份验证。本研究使用LG V30+收集了40个受试者的触摸动态数据集。参与者各玩了PUBG、Diep.io、Slither和Minecraft等四款手机游戏，每个游戏玩10分钟。使用提取的数据集对三种算法进行了训练和测试，并评估了它们的表现。",
