    "translated_abstract": "最近深度图聚类已经引起了很多关注，因为它可以增强模型在无监督场景下的表示学习能力。然而，适用于时间图的深度聚类方法 - 可以捕获关键的动态交互信息，并没有得到充分的探索。这意味着在许多面向聚类的现实场景中，时间图只能作为静态图来处理。这不仅导致了动态信息的丢失，也引发了巨大的计算消耗。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个名为TGC的通用框架，用于时间图深度聚类，它调整了深度聚类技术（聚类分配分布和邻接矩阵重构），以适应时间图基于交互序列的批处理模式。此外，我们还从几个方面讨论了时间图聚类与现有静态图聚类的差异。实验证明了TGC的卓越性能。",
