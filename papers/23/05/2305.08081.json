    "translated_abstract": "在频分双工系统中，基于深度学习的信道状态信息（CSI）反馈引起了学术界和工业界的广泛关注。本文重点研究将无线通信标准中的 Type-II 码本与深度学习相结合，以提高 CSI 反馈的性能。与现有基于深度学习的 Release 16 Type-II 码本研究不同，Release 17（R17）中的 Type-II 码本利用上行和下行信道之间角度-延迟域偏振部分互易性选择部分角度-延迟域端口进行测量和反馈下行 CSI，传统深度学习方法的性能由于稀疏结构的缺陷而受到限制。为解决这个问题，我们提出了两个采用深度学习来改进 R17 Type-II 码本的新视角。首先，考虑到上行信道的低信噪比，深度学习被用来精确选择特定的角度-延迟域端口，从而提高 CSI 的精度。其次，我们利用虚拟域和实际域之间的关系，通过训练深度神经网络来实现可靠的反馈。实验结果表明，我们所提出的方法可以显著提高 CSI 的反馈性能，并且具有更好的鲁棒性和通用性。",
