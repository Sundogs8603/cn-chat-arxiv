    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新的数据集和一种新方法，用于学习手部和联结目标姿态估计中的手物互动先验。我们首先使用视觉遥操作收集了一个数据集，其中人类操作员可以直接在物理模拟器中游戏来操纵联结对象。 我们记录数据并从模拟器获得有关目标姿态和接触信息的免费和准确注释。 我们的系统仅需要使用iPhone来记录人手运动，可以轻松扩展并大大降低数据和注释收集的成本。使用这些数据，我们学习了三维交互先验，包括捕获对象部件排列分布的鉴别器（在GAN中），以及生成联结对象上接触区域的扩散模型，以指导手势估计。这些结构和接触先验可以很容易地转移到现实世界数据，几乎没有任何领域差距。通过使用我们的数据和学习的先验，我们的方法显著提高了关键点定位性能。",
