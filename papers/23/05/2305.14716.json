    "translated_abstract": "尽管NLP有了重大进展，但在不同语言的NLP系统表现上仍存在显着差异。这些差异可能是由于资源分配不均和对不足资源语言的工作激励不够优化所导致的。为了跟踪并进一步激励公平语言技术的全球发展，我们介绍GlobalBench。先前的多语言基准是静态的，并且关注的是少数任务和少数语言。相比之下，GlobalBench是一个不断扩大的集合，旨在动态跟踪所有语言的所有NLP数据集的进展。除了仅仅测量准确度外，GlobalBench还跟踪了所有语言的预计每人效用和技术公平性，提供了一个多方面的视角，了解语言技术如何为世界各地的人服务。此外，GlobalBench旨在识别最需要服务的语言，并奖励针对这些语言的研究工作。目前，GlobalBench中最需要服务的语言主要是非洲和美洲原住民语言。",
