    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种解决公平PCA（FPCA）问题的新迭代算法。我们从[1]提出的最大最小公平PCA公式开始，推导出一个简单而高效的迭代算法，它基于最小化最大化（MM）方法。所提出的算法依赖于半正交约束的松弛，证明了算法的每次迭代都很紧密。所提议的算法的香草版需要在每次迭代中解决一个半正定规划（SDP），可以通过构造代理最大化问题的对偶问题将其进一步简化为一个二次规划。我们还提出了公平PCA问题的两个重要重构：a）公平鲁棒PCA——可以处理数据中的离群值；b）公平稀疏PCA——可以对估计的公平主成分进行稀疏约束。所提议的算法在计算上非常高效，并且会单调增加各自的设计目标。",
