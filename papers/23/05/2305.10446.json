    "abstract": "Emotion regulation is a crucial element in dealing with emotional events and has positive effects on mental health. This paper aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of emotional events by introducing a new French corpus of emotional narratives collected using a questionnaire for emotion regulation. We follow the theoretical framework of the Component Process Model which considers emotions as dynamic processes composed of four interrelated components (behavior, feeling, thinking and territory). Each narrative is related to a discrete emotion and is structured based on all emotion components by the writers. We study the interaction of components and their impact on emotion classification with machine learning methods and pre-trained language models. Our results show that each component improves prediction performance, and that the best results are achieved by jointly considering all components. Our results also show the effectiveness of pre-trained language models in predict",

    "translated_abstract": "情绪调节是处理情感事件的关键元素，并对心理健康有积极影响。本文旨在通过引入一种新的法语情感叙述语料库，该语料库是使用情绪调节问卷收集而来的，以提供更全面的情感事件理解。我们遵循组成过程模型的理论框架，将情绪视为由四个相互关联的组成部分（行为、感觉、思考和领域）组成的动态过程。每个叙述都与一种离散情感相关，并根据作者的所有情感组成部分构建结构。我们使用机器学习方法和预训练语言模型研究组成部分之间的交互及其对情感分类的影响。结果表明，每个组成部分都可以提高预测性能，并且共同考虑所有组成部分可以实现最佳结果。我们的结果还显示预训练语言模型在预测情感分类方面的有效性。",
