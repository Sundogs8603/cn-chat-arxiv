    "translated_abstract": "数百万贫民窟居民由于贫民窟内不足的道路基础设施而遭受城市服务无法访问的困境，而贫民窟道路规划对城市的可持续发展至关重要。现有的重组或启发式方法要么耗时，不能推广到不同的贫民窟，要么在可达性和建设成本方面产生次优的道路规划。本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习的方法，用于自动布局贫民窟道路。我们提出了一个通用图模型，用于捕获贫民窟的拓扑结构，并设计了一种新颖的图神经网络，用于选择计划道路的位置。通过掩码策略优化，我们的模型可以生成连接贫民窟地点的道路规划，以最小的建设成本。对不同国家的真实贫民窟进行大量实验验证了我们模型的有效性，可使可达性提高14.3％，对现有基线方法具有明显改进。",
