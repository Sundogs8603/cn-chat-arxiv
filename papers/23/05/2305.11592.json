    "translated_abstract": "在灾难事件中，社交媒体平台（如Twitter）是最有价值的信息来源之一。因此，人道主义组织、政府机构和志愿者依靠这些信息（即推文）的摘要来进行有效的灾难管理。尽管存在一些现有的监督和非监督方法来实现自动推文摘要，但这些方法要么需要大量的标记信息，要么不包含有关灾难的特定领域知识。最近的灾难摘要方法提出使用基于BERT的模型来提高摘要质量。然而，为了进一步提高性能，我们引入了领域特定知识的利用，而无需进行人力努力来理解推文的重要性（突出性），这进一步有助于摘要的创建和提高摘要质量。在本文中，我们提出了一个特定于灾难的推文摘要框架IKDSumm，它用于：",
