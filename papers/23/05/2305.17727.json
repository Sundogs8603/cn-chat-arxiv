    "translated_abstract": "推理是自然语言处理研究中一个至关重要的方面，但是目前的模型，包括大语言模型，在推理方面的处理还不够充分。对话推理作为其中一个关键组成部分，由于缺乏良好设计的认知模型而一直未被充分探索。本文受到对话认知的直觉理论的启发，提出了一个解释每个话语如何递归地获得和激活信息通道的对话认知模型（CCM）。此外，我们还对CCM进行了代数变换，得到了一个结构因果模型（SCM），在一些温和的假设下，SCM与各种因果发现方法兼容。我们进一步提出了SCM在话语级关系推理中的概率实现。通过利用变分推断，它探索了隐含原因的替代方案，解决了其不可观察性的问题，并通过证据下界重构了话语的因果表示。此外，我们还构建了...",
