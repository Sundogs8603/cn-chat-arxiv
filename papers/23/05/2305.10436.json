    "translated_abstract": "在第二语言的词汇学习中，现有的研究主要关注于学习界面或制定个性化的复习练习以最大化记忆保留。然而，学习内容，即闪卡上呈现的信息，大多数都保持不变。关键词记忆法是一种显著的学习策略，它通过使用发音相似的关键词构建声音和想象的联系来将新词汇与现有知识联系起来。此外，为了促进建立这些联系，生成与关键词相关的口头和视觉提示需要手动进行，这不可扩展。在本文中，我们探讨了利用大型语言模型自动生成关键词记忆法口头和视觉提示的机会。我们的方法是一个端到端的自动生成口头和视觉提示的流水线，可以自动生成高度容易记忆的提示。我们通过与传统闪卡和手动制作的关键词记忆法的比较，通过人类参与者实验来研究我们方法的有效性。结果表明，我们的方法明显优于传统闪卡，并可与手动制作的关键词记忆法相媲美。",

The approach significantly outperforms traditional flashcards and is comparable to manually created keyword mnemonics according to a human participant experiment."
