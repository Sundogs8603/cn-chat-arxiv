    "abstract": "In this technical report, a low-complexity deep learning system for acoustic scene classification (ASC) is presented. The proposed system comprises two main phases: (Phase I) Training a teacher network; and (Phase II) training a student network using distilled knowledge from the teacher. In the first phase, the teacher, which presents a large footprint model, is trained. After training the teacher, the embeddings, which are the feature map of the second last layer of the teacher, are extracted. In the second phase, the student network, which presents a low complexity model, is trained with the embeddings extracted from the teacher. Our experiments conducted on DCASE 2023 Task 1 Development dataset have fulfilled the requirement of low-complexity and achieved the best classification accuracy of 57.4%, improving DCASE baseline by 14.5%.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种用于声景分类的低复杂度深度学习系统。该系统由两个主要阶段组成：（阶段I）训练教师网络; 和（阶段II）利用教师网络的压缩知识训练学生网络。在第一阶段中，训练一个大规模的教师模型。在训练教师之后，提取特征图，即教师网络的倒数第二层的特征。在第二阶段中，利用从教师提取的特征图来训练低复杂度的学生网络。我们在DCASE 2023任务1开发数据集上进行的实验，满足低复杂度要求，并取得了57.4％的最佳分类准确率，相比DCASE基线提高了14.5％。",
