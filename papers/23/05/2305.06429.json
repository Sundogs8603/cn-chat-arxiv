    "abstract": "In Islam, readers must apply a set of pronunciation rules called Tajweed rules to recite the Quran in the same way that the angel Jibrael taught the Prophet, Muhammad. The traditional process of learning the correct application of these rules requires a human who must have a license and great experience to detect mispronunciation. Due to the increasing number of Muslims around the world, the number of Tajweed teachers is not enough nowadays for daily recitation practice for every Muslim. Therefore, lots of work has been done for automatic Tajweed rules' mispronunciation detection to help readers recite Quran correctly in an easier way and shorter time than traditional learning ways. All previous works have three common problems. First, most of them focused on machine learning algorithms only. Second, they used private datasets with no benchmark to compare with. Third, they did not take into consideration the sequence of input data optimally, although the speech signal is time series. T",

    "translated_abstract": "在伊斯兰教中，读者必须遵守一套发音规则，称为塔九德规则（Tajweed rules），以便以天使吉布利尔教给先知穆罕默德的方式朗读古兰经。传统的学习这些规则的正确应用的过程需要一个必须有执照和丰富经验的人来检测发音错误。由于世界各地穆斯林数量的增加，现今的塔九德教师数量已经不足以满足每位穆斯林日常诵经练习的需求。因此，已经进行了大量工作，以便对塔九德规则的发音错误进行自动检测，以帮助读者以比传统学习方式更简便和更短的时间正确地朗读古兰经。所有以前的工作都存在三个常见问题。首先，他们大多数只关注机器学习算法。其次，他们使用了没有可比性的私人数据集。第三，他们没有充分考虑输入数据序列的最优性，尽管语音信号是时间序列。",
    "tldr": "该论文研究了基于深度学习的古兰经发音错误检测，传统学习方式需要有执照的人检测，但受到师资短缺的影响，自动检测方法变得更加重要，之前的方法存在算法过度依赖，难以比较数据集和没有考虑时间序列等问题。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the deep learning-based detection of Quranic mispronunciation, which is traditionally only detectable by licensed individuals, but with a shortage of qualified personnel, automatic detection has become more important. However, past methods have over relied on algorithms, lacked benchmark datasets, and failed to consider time series."
