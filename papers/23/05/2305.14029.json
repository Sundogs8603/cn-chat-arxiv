    "translated_abstract": "本文将商业组织作为一个复杂自适应系统进行建模，提出了一个补充企业内部利润差异的基于公司的视角的观点。所提出的基于智能体的模型引入了内生的基于相似性的社交网络以及员工对由公司关键绩效指标确定的动态管理策略的反应。员工们基于价值的决策塑造了他人的行为，从中建立了一种企业文化，这些元素引发了相互交织的反馈机制，从而导致了意外的利润结果。模拟结果显示，比起较为中等的替代方案，极端的管理方式的变体在长期内获得了更高的利润。此外，我们观察到收敛于一个低强度监控的主导型管理策略以及高度货币激励合作行为的趋势。结果表明，采取措施加强企业文化的塑造和传播或将成为提高企业利润的策略。",
