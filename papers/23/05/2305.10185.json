    "translated_abstract": "布尔矩阵分解（BMF）将一个给定的二进制输入矩阵近似表示为两个更小的二进制因子的乘积。相对于使用标准算术的二进制矩阵分解，BMF使用布尔OR和布尔AND操作进行矩阵乘积运算，从而导致更低的重构误差。BMF是一个NP难题。在本文中，我们首先提出了一种交替优化（AO）策略，使用整数规划（IP）解决BMF中一个因子矩阵的子问题。我们还提供了两种初始化因子的方法。然后，我们展示了如何使用另一个IP将BMF的多个解组合到最优解。这使我们能够提出一种新算法：使用AO生成多个解，然后将它们以最优的方式组合起来。实验表明，我们的算法（可在GitLab上获得）在中等规模问题上优于现有技术的状态。",
