    "translated_abstract": "在过去几十年中，推荐系统在研究和产业社区中引起了广泛关注，并且许多研究致力于开发有效的推荐模型。这些模型主要从历史行为数据中学习潜在的用户偏好，进而估计用户-项目匹配关系以进行推荐。受到大型语言模型（LLMs）近期进展的启发，我们采用了一种不同的方法来开发推荐模型，将推荐视为LLMs的指令遵循。关键思想是用户的偏好或需求可以用自然语言描述（称为指令）来表达，从而LLMs可以理解并进一步执行指令以达到推荐任务的目的。我们通过指令微调开源LLM（3B Flan-T5-XL）来开发推荐方法，以更好地使LLMs适应推荐系统。为此，我们首先提出了一种转换方法，将用户行为数据转化为指令，并在大规模电子商务数据集上评估了提出的方法。实验结果表明，我们的方法优于几种最先进的推荐方法，在推荐准确性方面取得了显着的改进。",
