    "abstract": "Discovering conservation laws for a given dynamical system is important but challenging. In a theorist setup (differential equations and basis functions are both known), we propose the Sparse Invariant Detector (SID), an algorithm that auto-discovers conservation laws from differential equations. Its algorithmic simplicity allows robustness and interpretability of the discovered conserved quantities. We show that SID is able to rediscover known and even discover new conservation laws in a variety of systems. For two examples in fluid mechanics and atmospheric chemistry, SID discovers 14 and 3 conserved quantities, respectively, where only 12 and 2 were previously known to domain experts.",

    "translated_abstract": "发现给定动力系统的保守律是重要但具有挑战性的任务。在理论设置（已知微分方程和基函数）中，我们提出了Sparse Invariant Detector（SID），这是一种从微分方程中自动发现保守律的算法。其算法简单性确保了已发现保守数量的稳健性和可解释性。我们展示了SID能够在各种系统中重新发现已知保守律，甚至发现新的保守律。在流体力学和大气化学的两个例子中，SID分别发现了14个和3个守恒量，而这些领域专家先前只知道12个和2个。",
