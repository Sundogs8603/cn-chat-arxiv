    "translated_abstract": "J-UNIWARD是一种将秘密信息隐藏在JPEG盖板图像中的流行隐写术方法。作为一种内容自适应方法，J-UNIWARD旨在嵌入到纹理图像区域，这些区域的变化难以检测。为此，J-UNIWARD首先为每个DCT系数分配一个嵌入成本，该成本基于图像的小波残差计算，然后使用一种编码方法，该方法在嵌入所需的有效载荷的同时，最小化成本。更改一个DCT系数会影响23x23个小波系数窗口。为了加速成本图的计算，原始实现预先计算小波残差，然后对于每个更改的DCT系数，考虑一个23x23的小波残差窗口。然而，该实现错误地将窗口偏移了一个像素到右下方。在这份报告中，我们评估了这个off-by-one错误对生成的成本图的影响。一些图像块被高估，而其他图像块则被低估，但差异相对较小。我们提供了一个概念验证，说明如何检测使用带有偏移错误的J-UNIWARD隐藏的隐写术信息。",
