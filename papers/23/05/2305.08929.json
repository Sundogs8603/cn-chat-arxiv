    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的方法，如AlphaFold2（AF2），取得了与真实生物实验方法可比的蛋白质三级结构预测效果。虽然AF2在预测变异效果方面存在局限性，但其对序列变异的鲁棒性尚待确定。本文从野生型（WT）序列开始，通过进化方法生成对抗序列，AF2预测与WT存在显著差异。我们在CASP14上的实验证明，在蛋白质序列中仅修改3个氨基酸残基，采用替换、删除和插入策略的组合，AF2预测的本地距离差异测试（lDDT）的改变达到了46.61。此外，当应用于特定蛋白质SPNS2时，我们提出的算法成功地识别了对蛋白质结构确定至关重要且有生物学意义的氨基酸残基，可能表明可修改的蛋白质部位。",
