    "translated_abstract": "基于人工智能的聊天机器人成为缓解心理压力的解决方案。由于缺乏心理治疗数据，研究人员使用从在线同伴支持论坛抓取的对话来训练它们。但由于此类平台上的响应并非由专业人士提供，因此它们既包含符合标准的响应又包含不符合标准的响应。在这项工作中，我们尝试使用源自名为动机访谈治疗完整性（MITI）代码的行为编码方案所适应的标签来识别在线心理支持对话中存在的符合标准和不符合标准的响应类型，并展示如何将某些响应类型重新表达为更符合动机访谈标准的形式，从而使聊天机器人响应更符合动机访谈策略。作为概念证明，我们通过对Blender和GPT3进行微调来构建几个重新表达器，将MI不符合标准的“未经允许建议”响应转化为“经过许可的建议”。我们展示了如何借助人机合作实现这一目标，并在在线心理支持对话数据集上评估了我们的方法。结果表明，使用源自MI框架的重新表达技术可以提高心理压力支持对话中聊天机器人响应的符合性和质量。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes using motivational interviewing (MI) strategy to rephrase response types in online distress-support dialogue, improving compliance and quality of chatbot responses for psychological distress support conversations. By fine-tuning Blender and GPT3 to rephrase MI non-adherent \"Advise without permission\" responses into \"Advise with permission\", the approach is evaluated on a dataset of online distress-support dialogues and shows promising results."
