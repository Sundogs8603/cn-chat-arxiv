    "translated_abstract": "自回归搜索引擎是下一代信息检索系统的有前途的范例。这些方法利用Seq2Seq模型，其中每个查询可以直接映射到其相关文档的标识符。因此，它们因具有端到端可微分性等优点而受到赞扬。然而，自回归搜索引擎在检索质量上也面临着挑战，因为其需要对文档标识符进行精确生成。也就是说，如果在生成过程的任何一步中对其标识符做出了错误的预测，则目标文档将从检索结果中漏失。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的框架，即AutoTSG(自回归搜索引擎与术语集生成)，其特点是1)无序基于术语的文档标识符和2)基于集合的生成管道。利用AutoTSG，术语集标识符的任何排列都将导致相应文档的检索，从而大大放松了对标识符精确生成的要求。",
