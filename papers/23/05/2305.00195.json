    "translated_abstract": "医学研究常常需要提取每个协变量与结果之间的关系，并使用统计置信度测量。为此，通常使用简单的参数模型（例如线性回归系数），但通常是在整个数据集上拟合。然而，协变量可能在整个人口中没有统一的影响，因此统一的简单模型可能会漏掉异质信号。在本文中，我们提出了基于数据驱动方法的DDGroup (data-driven group discovery)，以有效识别数据中具有特征与标签之间统一线性关系的子群。DDGroup输出的区域是可以解释的，而且在计算上易于实现，适用于使用。理论上我们证明，如果给定足够大的样本，DDGroup保证可以找到具有统一线性关系的子群。我们还在模拟数据集和真实的医学数据集上证明了DDGroup的有效性。",
