    "abstract": "Although pre-trained named entity recognition (NER) models are highly accurate on modern corpora, they underperform on historical texts due to differences in language OCR errors. In this work, we develop a new NER corpus of 3.6M sentences from late medieval charters written mainly in Czech, Latin, and German.  We show that we can start with a list of known historical figures and locations and an unannotated corpus of historical texts, and use information retrieval techniques to automatically bootstrap a NER-annotated corpus. Using our corpus, we train a NER model that achieves entity-level Precision of 72.81-93.98% with 58.14-81.77% Recall on a manually-annotated test dataset. Furthermore, we show that using a weighted loss function helps to combat class imbalance in token classification tasks. To make it easy for others to reproduce and build upon our work, we publicly release our corpus, models, and experimental code.",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然预先训练的命名实体识别（NER）模型对现代语料库非常准确，但由于OCR错误和语言差异，它们在历史文本上表现不佳。在这项工作中，我们开发了一个新的NER语料库，其中包含36万个句子，主要是使用捷克语、拉丁语和德语编写的晚期中世纪文书。我们展示了我们可以从已知的历史人物和地点列表以及未注释的历史文本中开始，并使用信息检索技术自动引导NER注释的语料库。利用我们的语料库，我们训练了一个NER模型，它在手动注释的测试数据集上实现了72.81-93.98％的实体级精度和58.14-81.77％的召回率。此外，我们展示了使用加权损失函数可以帮助应对标记分类任务中的类别不平衡。为了使其他人能够重现和建立我们的工作，我们公开发布了我们的语料库，模型和实验代码。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一个新的NER语料库，从未注释的历史文本中引导注释管道，并训练了一个NER模型来识别历史文献中的人名和地名，实现了较高的精度和召回率。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a new NER corpus for historical texts, and demonstrates a pipeline for bootstrapping annotation from unannotated texts to achieve accurate NER. The resulting NER model achieves high precision and recall for recognizing historical persons and locations, and a weighted loss function helps to address class imbalance in token classification. The authors have publicly released their corpus, models, and experimental code to encourage further research."
