    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种端到端的深度学习方法，以矫正鱼眼图像并同时校准相机内参和畸变参数。我们的方法由两部分组成：使用Pix2Pix GAN和Wasserstein GAN（W-Pix2PixGAN）开发的Quick Image Rectification模块，以及使用CNN架构的Calibration模块。我们的快速校正网络具有良好的分辨率和鲁棒性，适用于摄像机型监控设备中的恒定标定。为了实现高质量的标定，我们使用从Quick Image Rectification模块中输出的直线特征作为指导样本传递给Calibration模块，以学习校正前后的几何关系。我们使用大量合成数据集来训练和验证我们的方法，并应用于透视图像数据集，表现出了高分辨率的鲁棒性和显著的峰值信噪比。",
