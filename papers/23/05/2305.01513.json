Our team Katana supplies several approaches based on decision tree ensembles algorithms to rank comparative documents in accordance with their relevance and argumentative support. We use PyTerrier library to apply ensembles models to a ranking problem, considering statistical text features and features based on comparative structures. We also employ large contextualized language modelling techniques, such as BERT, to solve the proposed ranking task. To merge this technique with ranking modelling, we leverage neural ranking library OpenNIR.  Our systems substantially outperforming the proposed baseline and scored first in relevance and second in quality according to the official metrics of the competition (for measure NDCG@5 score). Presented models could help to improve the performance of processing comparative queries in information retrieval and dialogue systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对Touche实验室“比较问题下的论证检索”任务提出了一个方案。我们的团队Katana提供了基于决策树集成算法的多种方法来按照相关性和论证支持排序比较文档。我们使用PyTerrier库将集成模型应用于排序问题，并考虑基于统计文本特征和基于比较结构的特征。我们还采用了大型上下文化语言建模技术，例如BERT，来解决所提出的排名任务。为了将这种技术与排序建模相结合，我们利用了神经排名库OpenNIR。我们的系统明显优于提议的基准，并在竞赛的官方指标（对于NDCG@5得分）中在相关性上排名第一，质量上排名第二。提出的模型可以帮助改进信息检索和对话系统中处理比较查询的性能。",
