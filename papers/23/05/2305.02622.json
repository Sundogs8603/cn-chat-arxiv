    "translated_abstract": "临界热流 (CHF) 是高热流量热力系统中沸腾换热过程的关键安全界限。鉴定CHF对于防止设备损坏和确保系统整体安全至关重要，但其具有复杂性，难以进行。为了深入了解这一复杂现象，各种方法学已被开发出来，但是高分辨率数据的获取受到了巨大的资源消耗限制。本研究提出了一种基于条件生成对抗网络 (cGANs) 的数据驱动图像到图像翻译方法，用于在CHF时重构沸腾系统的热数据。监督学习过程依赖于成对图像，其中包括从流沸腾实验中获得的全反射可视化和红外热测温测量。我们提出的方法不仅有可能提供将相界面动力学和热扰动联系起来的证据，还可能是一种可靠的非侵入式临界热流诊断方法。",
