    "translated_abstract": "适当的评分规则可以激励专家准确报告信念，但我们放宽了此假设，研究了当预测可以影响结果时（例如在股市上公开预测时），预测对专家信念的影响。我们发现在此设定下，最大化预期得分的报告通常不反映专家的信念，并给出了这些报告的不准确度界限。对于二元预测，如果专家预测对结果的影响有界，可以定义评分规则，使得最优报告与固定点非常接近。但对于超过两个结果的预测，这是不可能的。我们还在玩具模型中进行了数值模拟，显示了我们的界限在某些情况下是紧密的。",

For binary predictions with bounded influence, scoring rules can be defined to encourage near-fixed-point reports, but such rules are impossible for predictions over more than two outcomes."
