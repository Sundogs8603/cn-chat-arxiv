    "abstract": "In several regions across the globe, snow has a significant impact on hydrology. The amounts of water that infiltrate the ground and flow as runoff are driven by the melting of snow. Therefore, it is crucial to study the magnitude and effect of snowmelt. Snow droughts, resulting from reduced snow storage, can drastically impact the water supplies in basins where snow predominates, such as in the western United States. Hence, it is important to detect the time and severity of snow droughts efficiently. We propose Snow Drought Response Index or SnoDRI, a novel indicator that could be used to identify and quantify snow drought occurrences. Our index is calculated using cutting-edge ML algorithms from various snow-related variables. The self-supervised learning of an autoencoder is combined with mutual information in the model. In this study, we use random forests for feature extraction for SnoDRI and assess the importance of each variable. We use reanalysis data (NLDAS-2) from 1981 to 202",

    "translated_abstract": "在全球的几个地区，积雪对水文有着重要的影响，积雪的融化会导致地面渗水及径流的增加，因此研究积雪融化的程度和影响是至关重要的。在西部地区等积雪占主导的流域中，积雪储量的减少引发的积雪干旱会严重影响水资源供应。因此，高效地检测积雪干旱的发生时间和严重程度至关重要。我们提出了Snow Drought Response Index或SnoDRI，这是一种新型指标，可用于识别和量化积雪干旱事件。我们使用了先进的机器学习算法从各种积雪相关变量中计算出了指标。自编码器的自监督学习与模型中的互信息相结合。在本研究中，我们使用随机森林进行SnoDRI的特征提取，并评估每个变量的重要性。我们使用1981年至202年的再分析数据（NLDAS-2）。",
