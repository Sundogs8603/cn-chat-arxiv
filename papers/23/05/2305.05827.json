    "translated_abstract": "FinTech贷款在促进金融普惠方面发挥了重要作用，它缩短了处理时间和成本，提高了用户体验，并使得那些可能在传统银行贷款中无法获得信用认证的人们可以获得贷款。然而，人们对贷款筛选中潜在的算法决策偏见持有担忧。机器学习算法评估信用质量时可能会受到训练数据中的表征偏差的影响，因为我们只能访问已获批准贷款申请的违约结果标签，对于此类申请，借款人的社会经济特征优于被拒绝的贷款申请。因此，基于标记数据训练的模型在历史上被批准的人群中表现良好，但在低社会经济背景的借款人中不具有良好的泛化能力。本文研究了一个真实的FinTech贷款平台贷款筛选中的表征偏差问题，提出了一种基于对比学习和领域自适应的新方法来减少表征偏差，提高贷款筛选所使用机器学习算法的性能。我们的方法包括使用来自已批准和被拒绝的贷款申请的标记数据混合训练对比模型。然后，我们将学习到的表征适应于具有较低社会经济特征的贷款申请人的目标领域。我们的实验结果证明了我们的方法在减轻表征偏差，提高低社会经济背景借款人的贷款筛选准确性方面的有效性。",
