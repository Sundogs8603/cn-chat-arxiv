    "abstract": "We propose a fine-tuning algorithm for brain tumor segmentation that needs only a few data samples and helps networks not to forget the original tasks. Our approach is based on active learning and meta-learning. One of the difficulties in medical image segmentation is the lack of datasets with proper annotations, because it requires doctors to tag reliable annotation and there are many variants of a disease, such as glioma and brain metastasis, which are the different types of brain tumor and have different structural features in MR images. Therefore, it is impossible to produce the large-scale medical image datasets for all types of diseases. In this paper, we show a transfer learning method from high grade glioma to brain metastasis, and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves balanced parameters for both glioma and brain metastasis domains within a few steps.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种针对脑肿瘤分割的微调算法，只需要少量的数据样本并帮助网络不忘记原始任务。我们的方法基于主动学习和元学习。医学图像分割面临的困难之一是缺乏适当注释的数据集，因为需要医生对可靠的注释进行标记，并且有许多疾病的变体，例如胶质瘤和脑转移瘤，这些是不同类型的脑肿瘤，在MR图像中具有不同的结构特征。因此，不可能为所有类型的疾病产生大规模的医学图像数据集。在本文中，我们展示了从高级别胶质瘤到脑转移瘤的迁移学习方法，并证明所提出的算法在几步之内实现了胶质瘤和脑转移瘤领域的平衡参数。",
