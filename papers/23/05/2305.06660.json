    "translated_abstract": "当把个体的学习数据拟合成类似算法的学习模型时，观测值非常相互依赖且非平稳，以至于人们可能会想知道即使是实验性认知的常规工具——经典最大似然估计器（MLE）能够做些什么。本文的目的是展示如果Exp3算法中的学习率是恒定的，则学习率的估计不可能是有效的，另外，如果学习率随着样本量的增加呈多项式下降，则MLE的预测误差在概率上满足随样本量多项式下降的边界。",
    "tldr": "本文旨在证明：在Exp3算法中，如果学习率是恒定的，则MLE不能有效估计学习率；而如果学习率随样本量的增加呈多项式下降，则MLE的预测误差在概率上满足随样本量多项式下降的边界。",
