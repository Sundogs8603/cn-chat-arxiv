    "translated_abstract": "聚类数据是一种无监督学习方法，旨在将一组数据点分成多个组。它是机器学习和数据挖掘中至关重要但要求严格的课题。其成功应用涵盖了各个领域。然而，传统的聚类技术需要在特定的应用中考虑平衡的重要性。因此，本文解决了不平衡聚类问题的挑战，并提出了一种利用熵感知相似性的平衡聚类新方法，其可以定义为平衡度。我们称之为用于平衡聚类的熵感知相似度（EASB），通过完善不平衡数据的互补聚类和将熵结合到新的相似度公式中，该公式考虑了角度差异和距离，从而在聚类过程中最大限度地实现平衡。本文还针对实际黑色素瘤医学数据进行了所提出方法的有效性评估，具体地说是使用了国际皮肤成像合作组织提供的国际黑色素瘤数据库。",
