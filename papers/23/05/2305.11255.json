    "translated_abstract": "情感分析系统通过分析输入文本中的关键观点表达来确定给定目标的情感极性，而在隐式情感分析（ISA）中，观点提示以一种隐含和模糊的方式出现。因此，检测隐式情感需要常识和多跳推理能力来推断意见的潜在意图。受最近思维链索引（CoT）思想的启发，本研究介绍了一种三次跳推理（THOR）CoT框架，模仿ISA的类人推理过程。我们为THOR设计了一个三步提示原则，以逐步诱导隐式方面、意见和最终情感极性。我们的THOR+Flan-T5（11B）在监督设置上将技术水平推进了超过6％的F1值。更为显著的是，THOR+GPT3（175B）在零样本设置上将技术水平提升了超过50％的F1值。我们的代码位于https://github.com/scofield7419/THOR-ISA 。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes a Chain-of-Thought prompting-based framework for implicit sentiment analysis (ISA), called THOR. By mimicking the human-like reasoning process through three-hop reasoning, THOR supports common-sense and multi-hop reasoning to infer the latent intent of opinion, and induce the implicit aspect, opinion, and finally the sentiment polarity step by step. THOR+Flan-T5 (11B) and THOR+GPT3 (175B) achieve significant improvements in supervised and zero-shot setups, respectively."
