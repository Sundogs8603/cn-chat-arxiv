    "abstract": "As natural language processing (NLP) has recently seen an unprecedented level of excitement, and more people are eager to enter the field, it is unclear whether current research reproducibility efforts are sufficient for this group of beginners to apply the latest developments. To understand their needs, we conducted a study with 93 students in an introductory NLP course, where students reproduced the results of recent NLP papers. Surprisingly, we find that their programming skill and comprehension of research papers have a limited impact on their effort spent completing the exercise. Instead, we find accessibility efforts by research authors to be the key to success, including complete documentation, better coding practice, and easier access to data files. Going forward, we recommend that NLP researchers pay close attention to these simple aspects of open-sourcing their work, and use insights from beginners' feedback to provide actionable ideas on how to better support them.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着自然语言处理（NLP）近年来异常火爆，越来越多的人急于进入该领域，但目前的研究复现努力是否足以让这些初学者应用最新的进展还不清楚。为了了解初学者的需求，我们在一个介绍性的NLP课程中开展了一项研究，让学生复现最近NLP论文的结果。令人惊讶的是，我们发现他们的编程技能和对研究论文的理解对完成练习的付出仅有限的影响，相比之下，研究作者的可访问性努力是成功的关键，包括完整的文档、更好的编码实践和更容易获取的数据文件。前进时，我们建议NLP研究人员密切关注这些开源工作的简单方面，并使用初学者的反馈见解提供可操作的想法以更好地支持他们。",
