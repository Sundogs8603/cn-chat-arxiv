    "title": "Extreme ATM skew in a local volatility model with discontinuity: joint density approach. (arXiv:2305.10849v1 [q-fin.MF])",
    "abstract": "This paper concerns a local volatility model in which volatility takes two possible values, and the specific value depends on whether the underlying price is above or below a given threshold value. The model is known, and a number of results have been obtained for it. In particular, explicit pricing formulas for European options have been recently obtained and applied to establish a power law behaviour of the implied volatility skew in the case when the threshold is taken at the money. These results have been obtained by techniques based on the Laplace transform. The purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate how to obtain the same results by another method. This alternative approach is based on the natural relationship of the model with Skew Brownian motion and consists in the systematic use of the joint distribution of this stochastic process and some of its functionals.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一种本地波动率模型，其中波动率取两个可能的值，具体取决于基础价格是否高于或低于给定的阈值。该模型已知，并且已经得出了许多结果。特别是，最近已经得出了欧式期权明确的定价公式，并应用于确定当阈值位于平价处时，隐含波动率偏斜的幂律行为。这些结果是基于拉普拉斯变换技术获得的。本文的目的是演示如何通过另一种方法获得相同的结果。这种替代方法基于该模型与Skew Brownian运动的自然关系，并且是通过系统地使用该随机过程及其某些函数的联合分布来实现的。",

The paper confirms the power law behavior of the implied volatility skew in the model when the threshold is at the money by using an alternative approach based on joint distribution methods."
