    "translated_abstract": "对子宫内膜癌患者术前淋巴结转移风险进行评估是一项复杂而具有挑战性的任务。在原则上，机器学习和深度学习模型足够灵活和表达，可以捕捉临床风险评估动态。然而，在这种情况下，我们只能使用存在质量问题、缺失值、样本小和高维度的观测数据：我们不能从受到这些偏差影响的有限观测数据中可靠地学习这些模型。相反，我们选择学习因果性贝叶斯网络，以缓解上述问题，并利用临床医生和医师对子宫内膜癌的先前知识。我们引入了一种因果发现算法用于因果性贝叶斯网络，基于Bootstrap重抽样，而不是类似研究中使用的单一插补方法。此外，我们包括一个上下文变量，以评估选择偏差是否会导致学习虚假关联。最后，我们讨论了方法的优势。",

Researchers use a causal Bayesian network to learn the evaluation model due to limitations such as quality issues, missing values, and high dimensionality, and it has better capabilities for prior-knowledge utilization and bias mitigation."
