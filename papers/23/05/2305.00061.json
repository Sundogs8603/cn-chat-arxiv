    "translated_abstract": "自然语言模型已成功应用于各种自然语言处理推理任务，但仍然面临组合推理泛化问题。本文提出了一种名为“可解释的语言推理增强器（EVR+）”的推理框架，通过以下方式增强语言模型的组合推理能力：（1）允许模型明确生成和执行符号运算符，（2）以灵活的方式将复杂任务分解为多个简单任务。与其前身Explainable Verbal Reasoner (EVR)和采用类似思路的其他方法相比，我们的框架支持更多种类的推理，例如嵌套循环和不同类型的递归。为了评估我们的推理框架，我们构建了一个合成数据集，其中包括需要组合推理的5个任务。结果表明，我们的推理框架可以提高语言模型在这5个任务中的组合推理性能。",
