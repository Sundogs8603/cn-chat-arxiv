    "abstract": "We argue that explanations for \"algorithmic decision-making\" (ADM) systems can profit by adopting practices that are already used in the learning sciences. We shortly introduce the importance of explaining ADM systems, give a brief overview of approaches drawing from other disciplines to improve explanations, and present the results of our qualitative task-based study incorporating the \"six facets of understanding\" framework. We close with questions guiding the discussion of how future studies can leverage an interdisciplinary approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们认为，采用学习科学中已使用的实践方法来解释“算法决策制定”（ADM）系统可以带来利益。我们简要介绍了解释ADM系统的重要性，概述了借鉴其他学科来改进解释方法的方法，并呈现了我们的“六个理解方面”框架的定性任务研究结果。最后，我们提出一些问题，引导未来的研究如何利用跨学科方法。",
