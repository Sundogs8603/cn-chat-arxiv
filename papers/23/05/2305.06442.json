    "abstract": "As a consequence of the increasing influence of machine learning on our lives, everyone needs competencies to understand corresponding phenomena, but also to get involved in shaping our world and making informed decisions regarding the influences on our society. Therefore, in K-12 education, students need to learn about core ideas and principles of machine learning. However, for this target group, achieving all of the aforementioned goals presents an enormous challenge. To this end, we present a teaching concept that combines a playful and accessible unplugged approach focusing on conceptual understanding with empowering students to actively apply machine learning methods and reflect their influence on society, building upon decision tree learning.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习对我们生活的影响越来越大，每个人都需要理解相应现象的能力，同时也需要参与塑造我们的世界并做出关于对社会影响的知情决策。因此，在K-12教育中，学生需要学习机器学习的核心思想和原则。然而，对于这个目标群体来说，实现所有上述目标都是一个巨大的挑战。为此，我们提出了一种教学概念，将注重概念理解的有趣易懂的非插件方法与赋予学生积极应用机器学习方法和反思其对社会影响的能力相结合，基于决策树学习。",
