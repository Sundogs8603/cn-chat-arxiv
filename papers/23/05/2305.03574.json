    "abstract": "With the aim to stimulate future research, we describe an exploratory study of a railway rescheduling problem. A widely used approach in practice and state of the art is to decompose these complex problems by geographical scope. Instead, we propose defining a core problem that restricts a rescheduling problem in response to a disturbance to only trains that need to be rescheduled, hence restricting the scope in both time and space. In this context, the difficulty resides in defining a scoper that can predict a subset of train services that will be affected by a given disturbance. We report preliminary results using the Flatland simulation environment that highlights the potential and challenges of this idea. We provide an extensible playground open-source implementation based on the Flatland railway environment and Answer-Set Programming.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文描述了一项铁路重新调度问题的探索性研究，旨在刺激未来的研究。我们提出了一种核心问题的定义，即在响应扰动时仅限制需要重新调度的列车，从而在时间和空间上限制范围，而不是采用地理范围的分解方法。在这种情况下，困难在于定义一个可以预测给定扰动会影响哪些列车服务子集的范围规定器。我们报告了使用Flatland模拟环境得出的初步结果，突出了这个想法的潜力和挑战。我们提供了一个可扩展的游乐场开源实现，基于Flatland铁路环境和Answer-Set编程。",
