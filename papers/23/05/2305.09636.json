    "abstract": "We present SoundStorm, a model for efficient, non-autoregressive audio generation. SoundStorm receives as input the semantic tokens of AudioLM, and relies on bidirectional attention and confidence-based parallel decoding to generate the tokens of a neural audio codec. Compared to the autoregressive generation approach of AudioLM, our model produces audio of the same quality and with higher consistency in voice and acoustic conditions, while being two orders of magnitude faster. SoundStorm generates 30 seconds of audio in 0.5 seconds on a TPU-v4. We demonstrate the ability of our model to scale audio generation to longer sequences by synthesizing high-quality, natural dialogue segments, given a transcript annotated with speaker turns and a short prompt with the speakers' voices.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了 SoundStorm，一种用于高效的非自回归音频生成的模型。SoundStorm 接收 AudioLM 的语义标记作为输入，并依靠双向注意力和基于置信度的并行解码来生成神经音频编解码器的标记。与 AudioLM 的自回归生成方法相比，我们的模型在音色和声学条件下产生相同质量且更高一致性的音频，速度快两个数量级。SoundStorm 在 TPU-v4 上能在0.5秒内生成30秒的音频。我们通过合成带有说话者转换注释和短提示的高质量自然对话片段来展示我们的模型可以扩大音频生成的序列长度。",
