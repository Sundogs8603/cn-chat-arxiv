However, incomplete graph data and missing node attributes can have a negative impact on media knowledge discovery. Existing methods for handling attribute missing graph have limited assumptions or fail to capture complex attribute-graph dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose Attribute missing Graph Contrastive Learning (AmGCL), a framework for handling missing node attributes in attribute graph data. AmGCL leverages Dirichlet energy minimization-based feature precoding to encode in missing attributes and a self-supervised Graph Augmentation Contrastive Learning Structure (GACLS) to learn latent variables from the encoded-in data. Specifically, AmGCL utilizies feature reconstruction based on structure-attribute energy minimization while maximizes the lower bound of evidence for latent representation mutual information.",

    "translated_abstract": "属性图在多媒体应用中使用广泛，图表示学习（GRL）已经成功地应用于属性图数据分析。然而，不完整的图数据和缺失的节点属性可能会对媒体知识发现产生负面影响。现有的处理属性缺失图的方法存在有限的假设或无法捕捉复杂的属性-图形依赖关系。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了基于自监督对比学习的属性缺失图对比学习（AmGCL）框架，用于处理属性图数据中的缺失节点属性。AmGCL利用基于狄利克雷能量的特征预编码来对缺失属性进行编码，利用自监督图增强对比学习结构（GACLS）从编码数据中学习潜在变量。具体而言，AmGCL利用结构-属性能量最小化进行特征重构，同时最大化互信息的下限以学习潜在表示。",
