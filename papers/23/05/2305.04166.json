    "translated_abstract": "图像字幕是一种仍然吸引全球研究社区兴趣的视觉语言任务。虽然MS-COCO字幕基准是在2015年发布的，但它仍然被广泛使用来评估高级字幕模型的性能。然而，仅在MS-COCO字幕数据集上训练的最新字幕模型仅在英语语言模式方面表现良好；它们在越南捕捉的上下文或使用越南语流畅字幕图像方面的表现并不好。为了贡献于像越南这样的低资源研究社区，我们引入了一种新颖的越南语图像字幕数据集，UIT-OpenViIC。我们的数据集包括越南的复杂场景，并由越南人根据严格的规则和监督进行手动注释。在本文中，我们更详细地介绍了数据集的创建过程。从初步分析中，我们展示了我们的数据集对于最新的最先进的翻译模型而言具有挑战性。",
