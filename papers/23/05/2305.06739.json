    "translated_abstract": "运动是磁共振成像(MRI)中的主要挑战之一。由于MR信号在频率空间中获取，任何成像物体的运动都会导致复杂的伪影，此外还会产生其他MR成像伪影。深度学习已经经常被提出用于重建过程的多个阶段中的运动校正。MRI采集序列的广泛应用，感兴趣的解剖学和病理学以及运动模式（刚性vs可变形和随机vs规律性）使得全面性解决方案不太可能。为了促进不同应用之间的思想传递，该综述提供了一份详细的基于学习的MRI运动校正方法概述及其常见挑战和潜力。该综述识别了不同应用之间的数据使用、体系结构和评估策略的差异和协同作用。我们批判性地讨论了大趋势并概述了未来的方向，旨在增强MRI中深度学习的回顾性运动校正能力。",
