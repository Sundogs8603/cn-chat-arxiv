    "abstract": "Nowadays, it is common for people to take photographs of every beverage, snack, or meal they eat and then post these photographs on social media platforms. Leveraging these social trends, real-time food recognition and reliable classification of these captured food images can potentially help replace some of the tedious recording and coding of food diaries to enable personalized dietary interventions. Although Central Asian cuisine is culturally and historically distinct, there has been little published data on the food and dietary habits of people in this region. To fill this gap, we aim to create a reliable dataset of regional foods that is easily accessible to both public consumers and researchers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on creating a Central Asian Food Dataset (CAFD). The final dataset contains 42 food categories and over 16,000 images of national dishes unique to this region. We achieved a classification accuracy of 88.70\\% (42 classes) on the CAFD us",

    "translated_abstract": "当今，人们普遍会拍摄他们所吃的每一种饮料、零食或餐点的照片，然后将这些照片发布在社交媒体平台上。利用这些社交趋势，实时的食品识别和这些捕获的食品图像的可靠分类可以在一定程度上替换一些单调的膳食记录和编码，以实现个性化的膳食干预。虽然中亚菜肴在文化和历史上具有独特性，但对这个地区的人们的食品和膳食习惯的发表数据很少。为填补这个空白，我们旨在创建一个可靠的地区食品数据集，这个数据集对广大消费者和研究人员都很容易获取。就我们所知，这是第一份关于创建中亚食品数据集（CAFD）的工作。最终数据集包含42个食品类别和超过16,000张属于该地区独特的国家美食的图像。我们在CAFD上实现了88.70％（42个类别）的分类准确率。",
