We show that iterated admissibility characterizes the behavioral implications of \"cautious rationality and common cautious belief in cautious rationality\" in a terminal lexicographic type structure. For arbitrary type structures, the behavioral implications of these epistemic assumptions are characterized by the solution concept of self-admissible set (Brandenburger, Friedenberg and Keisler 2008). We also show that analogous conclusions hold under alternative epistemic assumptions, in particular if cautiousness is \"transparent\" to the players.

    "translated_abstract": "我们定义了谨慎和谨慎信念的概念，为有限博弈中的迭代允许性提供认识条件。我们展示了在终端词典类型结构中，“谨慎理性和谨慎理性的普遍谨慎信念”的行为含义可以用迭代允许性来刻画。对于任意类型结构，这些认知假设的行为含义可以用自允许集的解决概念（Brandenburger、Friedenberg和Keisler 2008）来描述。我们还表明，在替代认知假设下，类似的结论成立，特别地，如果对玩家而言谨慎性是“透明”的。",

It shows that the behavioral implications of \"cautious rationality and common cautious belief in cautious rationality\" in a terminal lexicographic type structure can be characterized by iterated admissibility, and by the solution concept of self-admissible set for arbitrary type structures. Similar conclusions hold under alternative epistemic assumptions, particularly if cautiousness is \"transparent\" to the players."
