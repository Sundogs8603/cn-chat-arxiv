    "translated_abstract": "实例分割是图像检测的一种形式，在物体细化、医学图像分析和图像/视频编辑等方面有广泛应用，这些应用都需要高度精确的结果。然而，即便是最先进的完全自动化实例分割算法，其精度常常无法达到。对于小而复杂的对象来说，性能差距尤为明显。通常，从业者只能采用完全手动的注释方法，这可能是一个繁琐的过程。为了克服这个问题，我们提出了一种新的方法，以实现更精确的预测，并为高曲率、复杂和小规模对象生成更高质量的分割掩模。我们的人类辅助分割模型HAISTA-NET，扩充了现有的Strong Mask R-CNN网络，以包括人类指定的部分边界。此外，我们还提出了一个手绘部分物体边界的数据集，称为人类注意力地图。我们还引入了一种新的损失函数，它考虑到了部分注意力地图和原始掩模提议，这使网络能够关注人们认为最重要的区域。在PASCAL VOC和COCO数据集上的实验结果表明，我们提出的方法优于强基线，并在小而复杂对象实例分割方面实现了最先进的性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a human-assisted instance segmentation approach, called HAISTA-NET, which augments the existing instance segmentation network with human-specified partial boundaries to generate more accurate segmentation masks. A new loss function is also introduced to guide the network to attend to the areas where humans consider most important. The proposed method outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on small and complex object instance segmentation."
