    "translated_abstract": "语音情绪识别(SER)是实现情感感知交互的关键因素。深度学习(DL)改善了SER模型的性能，但设计DL体系结构需要先前的经验和实验评估。鼓励地，神经体系结构搜索(NAS)允许自动搜索最优DL模型。特别地，可区分的体系结构搜索(DARTS)是一种使用NAS搜索最优化模型的有效方法。在本文中，我们提出DARTS用于联合CNN和LSTM的体系结构，以改善SER性能。我们选择CNN LSTM耦合的原因是结果表明类似的模型能够提高性能。虽然SER研究人员已将CNN和RNN分别考虑，但DARTs同时用于CNN和LSTM的可行性仍需要探索。通过对IEMOCAP数据集的实验，我们证明了我们的方法优于使用DA的最佳报告结果。",
