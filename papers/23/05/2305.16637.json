    "translated_abstract": "排名系统是现代信息检索应用（例如搜索引擎和推荐系统）的关键组件。除了与用户相关的排名相关性外，向项目提供者公平的曝光度也被认为是排名优化的重要因素。许多公平排名算法已被提出以联合优化排名相关性和公平性。然而，我们发现大多数现有的公平排名方法采用贪心算法，仅针对下一个即时会话或请求优化排名。正如本文所示，这种短视的范式可能限制排名优化的上限，并导致长期的次优性能。为此，我们提出了FARA，一种新颖的未来感知排名算法，用于排名相关性和公平优化。FARA不是贪婪地优化下一个会话的排名，而是通过联合优化多个排名列表并将它们保存到未来会话中，来提前规划。特别地，FARA旨在最小化排名列表的公平性和相关性差异，并考虑未来会话对当前排名的影响。我们在真实世界数据集上的实验证明，FARA在排名相关性和公平性方面优于现有的公平排名算法。",

Experimental results demonstrate that FARA outperforms state-of-the-art fair ranking algorithms in terms of both ranking relevance and fairness."
