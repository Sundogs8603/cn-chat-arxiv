    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统通过用户和物品的表示学习来了解用户偏好，而现代推荐模型开始利用用户表现出的各种行为类型的信息，以提高表示学习效果。在真实世界的情况下，用户行为图不仅是多重的，而且是动态的，即图随时间快速演变，添加或删除各种类型的节点和边缘，这导致邻域扰动。然而，大多数现有方法忽略了这种流动动力学，因此一旦图形发生显着演变，它们需要重新训练，使它们不适用于在线学习环境。此外，动态图中存在的邻域扰动会恶化基于邻居聚合的图模型的性能。为此，我们提出了SUPA，这是一个新颖的动态多重异构图的图神经网络。与邻居聚合体系结构相比，SUPA开发了一个时间感知的消息传递方案，以自适应地聚合来自各种邻居的节点信息。此外，我们还整合了一个动态图编码器来捕捉图级动态。因此，我们可以以在线方式高效地生成与其历史行为相关的用户和物品表示。三个公共基准测试的实验结果验证了SUPA与最先进方法相比的有效性和效率。",
