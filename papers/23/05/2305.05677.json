    "translated_abstract": "西班牙是世界上第三大猪肉生产国，许多农场依赖于这个市场。然而，当前的定价体系是不公平的，因为一些人比其他人有更好的市场信息。在这种情况下，历史价格是易于获取和经济实惠的数据来源，可以帮助所有代理商更好地了解市场。然而，数据采集延迟可能会影响他们的定价决策。在本文中，我们研究了多个预测算法在价格预测系统中的数据采集延迟对其影响。我们描述了最佳提案的集成到决策支持系统原型中，并在实际情况下进行了测试。具体而言，我们使用西班牙最重要的地区猪肉市场的公共数据，由农业部发布，延迟两周，和订阅方式获取的同一日的同一市场数据。结果表明，最佳预测算法和两周延迟的数据相比，订阅数据可以减少错误差异，这证明了集成多个算法可以有效缓解数据时间滞后的影响。",
