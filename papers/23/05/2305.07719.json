    "translated_abstract": "理解次恒星光谱数据和模型之间的差异一直是个挑战，尤其对于自洽模型网格的全面研究。本文采用随机森林监督机器学习方法，研究了14个以前发表的棕矮星模型网格（从1997到2021年）。随机森林方法让我们能够分析这些模型网格的预测能力，并在近似贝叶斯计算框架下解释数据。我们的数据集包括3个基准棕矮星（Gl 570D，ε Indi Ba和Bb）以及19个L型和T型矮星的样本；这个样本之前曾使用传统贝叶斯方法（嵌套取样）在Lueber等人（2022）中进行过分析。我们发现，可以独立于所选择的模型网格，强有力地预测棕矮星的有效温度。然而，推断棕矮星表面重力加速度和金属丰度因所选择的模型网格而异。",
