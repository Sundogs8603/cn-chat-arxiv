    "translated_abstract": "个人对核心家庭和扩展家庭的满意度在一个人的日常生活中扮演着至关重要的角色。因此，更好地了解决定一个人对家庭满意度的特征可以为更好的社会政策设计打开大门。为此，该研究考察了家族树图与家庭成员对核心家庭和扩展家庭的满意度之间的关系。我们收集了来自486个家庭的数据，其中包括家族树图和家庭成员之间的满意度。我们得到了一个能够解释75%家庭成员对彼此满意度的模型。我们发现了让家庭成员更加满意的三个指标。首先，平均而言，较大的家庭有更满意的成员。此外，没有继兄弟姐妹的同父母家庭-即成年子女已经成家的家庭，在兄弟姐妹和父母方面也更满意。最后，家庭成员的平均满意度和家庭的收入水平息息相关。",
