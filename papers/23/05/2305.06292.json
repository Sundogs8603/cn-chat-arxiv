    "translated_abstract": "多模态轨迹预测方法通常使用单个代理度量标准（边际度量标准），例如最小平均位移误差（ADE）和最终位移误差（FDE）进行评估。然而，这些度量标准无法捕捉多个互动代理的联合表现。仅关注边际度量标准可能会导致不自然的预测，如碰撞轨迹或明显一起行走的人的发散轨迹。因此，针对边际度量标准优化的方法会导致过于乐观的性能估计，这对轨迹预测研究的进展有害。为了应对边际度量标准的局限性，我们首次全面评估了最先进的轨迹预测方法与多代理度量标准（联合度量标准）之间的关系：JADE、JFDE和碰撞率。我们通过量化证据和定性示例展示了联合度量标准的重要性，而不是边际度量标准。",
