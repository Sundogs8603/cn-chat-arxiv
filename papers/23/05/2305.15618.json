    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种针对不成对数据的统计降尺度的两阶段概率框架。统计降尺度通过一个概率映射来将低分辨率的数据从（可能存在偏见的）粗粒度数值方案转换为与高保真度方案一致的高分辨率数据。我们的框架通过串联两个转换来解决这个问题：一个由最优传输图实现的反偏置步骤，以及一个由概率扩散模型实现的上采样步骤，并将条件采样后的概率分布纳入该方法，这种方法能够在不使用成对数据的前提下确定条件分布，并从存在偏见的样本中真实地恢复相关的物理统计信息。我们用一维和二维流体流动问题证明了该方法的效用，这些问题代表了天气和气候数值模拟中的核心困难。我们的方法可以从低分辨率的输入中生成真实的高分辨率输出。",
