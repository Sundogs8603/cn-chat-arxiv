    "translated_abstract": "市场做市（MM）是量化金融中的一个重要研究课题，代理商需要不断地优化询价和叫价来提供流动性和赚取利润。限价订单簿（LOB）包含所有活跃限价订单的信息，是决策制定的基础。演化的、高维的和低信噪比的LOB数据的建模是一个关键的挑战。传统的MM策略依赖于强假设，如价格过程、订单到达过程等。以往的强化学习（RL）需要手动建立市场特征，这种做法不能很好地代表市场。本文提出了一种基于LOB数据的市场做市RL代理。我们利用具有卷积滤波器和注意力机制（Attn-LOB）的神经网络从LOB中提取特征。我们为MM任务设计了一个新的连续动作空间和混合奖励函数。最后，我们进行了综合的实验来测试延迟和可解释性，证明了我们的方法的有效性。",
