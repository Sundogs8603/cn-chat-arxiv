    "abstract": "This paper presents machine-learning methods to address various problems in Greek philology. After training a BERT model on the largest premodern Greek dataset used for this purpose to date, we identify and correct previously undetected errors made by scribes in the process of textual transmission, in what is, to our knowledge, the first successful identification of such errors via machine learning. Additionally, we demonstrate the model's capacity to fill gaps caused by material deterioration of premodern manuscripts and compare the model's performance to that of a domain expert. We find that best performance is achieved when the domain expert is provided with model suggestions for inspiration. With such human-computer collaborations in mind, we explore the model's interpretability and find that certain attention heads appear to encode select grammatical features of premodern Greek.",

    "translated_abstract": "本篇论文提出了一种基于机器学习的方法来解决希腊语语言学中的各种问题。首先，我们在迄今为止用于此目的的最大预现代希腊语数据集上训练了BERT模型，发现并纠正了抄写员在文本传递过程中未被发现的错误。此外，我们展示了该模型在填补由于预现代手稿材料老化导致的缺口方面的能力，并将其性能与领域专家的表现进行了比较。我们发现，当领域专家得到模型的启示性建议时，才能达到最佳性能。考虑到这种人与计算机的合作，我们探讨了模型的可解释性，并发现一些注意力头似乎编码了预现代希腊语的选择性语法特征。",
