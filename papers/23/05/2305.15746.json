    "abstract": "The research explores the influence of preschool attendance (one year before full-time school) on the development of children during their first year of school. Using data collected by the Australian Early Development Census, the findings show that areas with high proportions of preschool attendance tended to have lower proportions of children with at least one developmental vulnerability. Developmental vulnerablities include not being able to cope with the school day (tired, hungry, low energy), unable to get along with others or aggressive behaviour, trouble with reading/writing or numbers. These findings, of course, vary by region. Using Data Analysis and Machine Learning, the researchers were able to identify three distinct clusters within Queensland, each characterised by different socio-demographic variables influencing the relationship between preschool attendance and developmental vulnerability. These analyses contribute to understanding regions with high vulnerability and the ",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了出席幼儿园（全日制学校前一年）对儿童在其第一年学校期间发展的影响。使用澳大利亚早期发展普查收集的数据，发现出席幼儿园比例较高的地区往往有较低比例的儿童至少存在一个发展性脆弱性。发展性脆弱性包括不能应对整个学校日（疲惫、饥饿、精力低下）、不能与他人相处或者具有攻击性，以及阅读/写作或数学方面存在问题。这些发现当然会因地区而异。使用数据分析和机器学习，研究人员能够识别出昆士兰省内的三个不同的群集，每个群集的特点是不同的社会人口统计变量影响幼儿园出席与发展脆弱性之间的关系。这些分析有助于理解高脆弱性地区和该分析提供了有关如何在这些区域应用资源的见解。",
