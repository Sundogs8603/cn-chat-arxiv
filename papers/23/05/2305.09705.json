When paired with a parameter-free model based on P\\'olya's Urn, the worst-case computational and memory complexities scale quasi-linearly and linearly with the number of observed edges, making it efficient on sparse graphs, and requires only integer arithmetic. Key to our method is bits-back coding, which is used to sample edges and vertices without replacement from the edge-list in a way that preserves the structure of the graph. Optimality is proven under a class of random graph models that are invariant to permutations of the edges and of vertices within an edge. Experiments indicate Random Edge Coding can achieve competitive compression performance on real-world network datasets and scales to graphs with millions of nodes and edges.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种压缩大型标记图的一次性方法，称为随机边编码。当与基于Pólya's Urn的无参数模型配对使用时，最坏情况的计算和内存复杂度随观察到的边数几乎线性和线性地缩放，使其在稀疏图上高效，并且仅需要整数算术。我们方法的关键在于bits-back编码，它被用于从边缘列表中无替换地对边缘和顶点进行采样，以保留图的结构。在一类随机图模型下证明了最优性，该模型对排列的边和边内顶点的排列具有不变性。实验表明，随机边编码可以在现实世界的网络数据集上实现具有竞争力的压缩性能，并且可以扩展到具有数百万个节点和边的图形。",
