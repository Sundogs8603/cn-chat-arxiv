    "en_tdlr": "A critical density for network reconstruction is identified in this paper, where a method producing random graphs with desired link density is used to infer the structure of financial networks from aggregate observables. The method exhibits an `unreconstructability' phase below the minimum critical link density, leading to at least one constraint far from its expected value in typical individual realizations. The critical density is shown to differ from those of the onset of the giant component and of the unique component in the graph, and is established for various theoretical and empirical distributions of interbank assets and liabilities."
