    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了图神经网络 (GNNs) 是否具有从小图中学习的知识可推广到同一领域的大图中。之前的研究表明，不同大小的图之间的分布偏移，尤其是度分布，可能会导致图分类任务的性能下降。然而，在生物数据集中，度数是有界的，因此度分布的偏移很小。即使度分布偏移很小，我们观察到GNNs在同一数据集的大图上的性能仍然下降，暗示有其他原因。事实上，以往对于真实数据集中各种图尺寸引起的分布偏移类型和属性的探索不足。此外，以前的尺寸可泛化性分析大多集中在空间领域。为填补这些空白，我们采用谱角度去研究GNNs在生物图数据上的尺寸可泛化性。我们首先提出一个新框架来模拟各种类型的度分布偏移，并利用它来测试GNNs 在真实生物数据集上的尺寸可泛化性。我们的实验表明，除了度分布偏移外，GNNs 还对图大小变化引起的谱分布偏移很敏感。我们进一步分析了不同的GNN模型的影响，并表明，一些模型比其他模型更具有尺寸泛化性。本文展示了关于GNNs尺寸可泛化性问题的新观点和实践，并为该领域的未来研究提供了有益的洞察和建议。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper investigates the size generalizability of GNNs by studying their sensitivity to the degree and spectral distribution shifts caused by varying graph sizes on real biological datasets. The authors propose a new framework and experiments show that GNNs are sensitive to both types of distribution shifts and that some GNN models are more robust to size variation than others. They shed light on the issue of size generalizability of GNNs and provide insights and practices for future research in this area."
