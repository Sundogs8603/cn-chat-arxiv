    "translated_abstract": "许多决策制定的机器学习方法，如强化学习，依赖于模拟器或预测模型来预测感兴趣的量的时间演变，例如智能体的状态或策略的奖励。这些复杂现象的预测通常由高度非线性的动力系统描述，使得它们在基于优化的决策制定中的使用具有挑战性。Koopman算子理论通过通过线性动态系统描述预测来解决这个问题。这使得系统分析和长期预测变得简单--只涉及矩阵乘法。然而，将其转化为线性系统通常是非平凡的和未知的，需要基于学习的方法。虽然存在各种方法，但它们通常缺乏关键的学习理论保证，因此所获得的模型在数据和维度增加时的行为通常不清楚。通过提出一种新颖的基于Koopman核的回归方法，我们解决了上述挑战，该方法直接从历史观察中学习到未来预测在Koopman算子空间中的映射。我们的方法享有可证明的学习理论保证，并在广泛的应用中与现有的最先进方法匹配（或优于），包括机器人操作，视频预测和交通预测。",
