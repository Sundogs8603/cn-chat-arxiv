    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，损伤检测方法迅速从先进的信号处理方法转变为机器学习，尤其是深度学习模型，以准确地、非侵入性地估计梁结构状态。但随着深度学习模型达到巅峰表现，人们也观察到了它们适用性的限制和易受攻击的弱点。其中最重要的一个原因是深度学习系统内在可解释性的缺失，由于知识编码在张量值中而没有包含逻辑约束。本文提出了一种神经符号模型，基于新颖的认知架构，将卷积网络的处理能力与直接将实际逻辑包含到模型中的查询交互控制结合起来，用于悬臂梁损伤检测。该混合判别模型不仅能够精确地检测损伤，而且能够提供损伤的解释和定位，使其在操作条件下更可靠和可信。",
