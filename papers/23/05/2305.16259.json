    "title": "Neural Natural Language Processing for Long Texts: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art. (arXiv:2305.16259v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)",
    "abstract": "The adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has greatly benefited Natural Language Processing (NLP) during the past decade. However, the demands of long document analysis are quite different from those of shorter texts, while the ever increasing size of documents uploaded on-line renders automated understanding of long texts a critical area of research. This article has two goals: a) it overviews the relevant neural building blocks, thus serving as a short tutorial, and b) it surveys the state-of-the-art in long document NLP, mainly focusing on two central tasks: document classification and document summarization. Sentiment analysis for long texts is also covered, since it is typically treated as a particular case of document classification. Additionally, this article discusses the main challenges, issues and current solutions related to long document NLP. Finally, the relevant, publicly available, annotated datasets are presented, in order to facilitate further research.",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，深度神经网络（DNN）的采用极大地促进了自然语言处理（NLP）的发展。然而，长文本分析的需求与短文本有很大不同，而网络上传输的文档大小不断增加，使长文本的自动理解成为一项关键的研究领域。本文的两个目标是：a）概述相关的神经构建模块，作为短教程；b）总结长文本NLP的现状，主要关注两个核心任务：文档分类和文档摘要。情感分析也涵盖在内，因为它通常被视为文档分类的特例。此外，本文还讨论了长文本NLP相关的主要挑战、问题和解决方案。最后，介绍了相关的公开的注释数据集，以便促进进一步研究。",
