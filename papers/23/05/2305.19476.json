    "translated_abstract": "探索的一种有效技术是通过鼓励对访问状态空间的均匀覆盖来最大化已访问状态分布的熵，即状态熵。然而，它在有任务奖励的监督设置中往往难以应对，其中代理趋向于访问高价值状态以利用任务奖励。这个偏好会导致高价值状态和低价值状态的分布不平衡，当分布变得更加均匀时，状态熵会增加，从而偏向于探索低价值区域。当高价值状态在状态空间中分布狭窄时，这个问题会进一步恶化，使得代理完成任务变得更加困难。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的探索技术，最大化值条件状态熵，它分别估计每个状态价值估计条件下的状态熵，然后最大化它们的加权和。值条件状态熵量化了低价值和高价值状态区域的覆盖范围，从而使其对不平衡问题更加健壮。我们展示了我们的方法在一系列具有挑战性的MuJoCo基准测试和Atari游戏上显著优于现有的基于熵的探索方法。",
