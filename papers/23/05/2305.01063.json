    "abstract": "Experts advising decision-makers are likely to display expertise which varies as a function of the problem instance. In practice, this may lead to sub-optimal or discriminatory decisions against minority cases. In this work we model such changes in depth and breadth of knowledge as a partitioning of the problem space into regions of differing expertise. We provide here new algorithms that explicitly consider and adapt to the relationship between problem instances and experts' knowledge. We first propose and highlight the drawbacks of a naive approach based on nearest neighbor queries. To address these drawbacks we then introduce a novel algorithm - expertise trees - that constructs decision trees enabling the learner to select appropriate models. We provide theoretical insights and empirically validate the improved performance of our novel approach on a range of problems for which existing methods proved to be inadequate.",

    "translated_abstract": "向决策者提供建议的专家往往会显示出随问题实例变化而变化的专业知识水平。在实践中，这可能导致针对少数情况的次优或歧视性决策。在本文中，我们将这种知识深度和广度的变化建模为将问题空间划分为不同专业知识区域。我们提供了一些新算法，它们明确考虑并适应问题实例与专家知识之间的关系。我们首先提出并强调了一种基于最近邻查询的天真方法的缺点。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了一种新的算法——专业知识树，它构建决策树，使学习者能够选择适当的模型。我们提供了理论见解，并在一系列现有方法被证明不足以解决问题的问题上进行了经验证实了我们的新方法的改进性能。",
