This article presents a 5-level AI Capability Assessment Model (AI-CAM) and a related AI Capabilities Matrix (AI-CM) to assist practitioners in AI comprehension and adoption.

They are founded on a comprehensive conception of AI compared to those in other AI adoption models and are also open-source artefacts. Thus, the AI-CAM and AI-CM present an accessible resource to help inform organisational decision-makers on the capability requirements for (1) AI-based data analytics use cases based on machine learning technologies; (2) Knowledge representation to engineer and represent data, information and knowledge using semantic technologies; and (3) AI-based solutions that seek to emulate human reasoning and decision-making. The AI-CAM covers the core capability",
