    "translated_abstract": "标准的新闻经销商模型假设需求是随机的，同时对于超额或不足的成本进行成本分析。优化存货水平可以利用著名的关键分位公式来确定。虽然模型已经在许多应用程序中被利用，但在实践中，通常了解问题的更多特征和特点。利用这些特征，通常会使用机器学习来预测库存水平，而不是经典的新闻经销商方法。一系列新兴的研究已经展示了如何将机器学习预测纳入模型中，以规避下限并提高性能。本文开发了第一个整合了机器学习预测的新闻经销商模型。本文考虑了一个重复的新闻经销商设置，并具有非静止需求。每个周期都有一个预测需求，并且正如在机器学习中的情况，预测可能是有噪声的。目标是使库存管理算法利用这些预测来优化库存水平。",
