    "translated_abstract": "最近，在时间序列预测研究中取得了显著的进展，越来越关注分析时间序列数据的性质，例如通道独立性（CI）和通道依赖性（CD），而不仅仅关注设计复杂的预测模型。然而，当前研究主要集中在单独的CI或CD上，有效地结合这两个相反的属性以实现协同效应的挑战仍然是一个未解决的问题。在本文中，我们仔细研究了CI和CD的相反属性，并提出了一个迄今未能有效回答的实际问题，即“如何有效地混合时间序列的CI和CD属性以实现更好的预测性能？”为了回答这个问题，我们提出了Mlinear（MIX-Linear），这是一种简单而有效的基于线性层的方法。Mlinear的设计理念主要包括两个方面：（1）基于动态调节CI和CD属性的机制",
