    "title": "Carbon Emission Reduction Effect of RMB Appreciation: Empirical Evidence from 283 Prefecture-Level Cities of China. (arXiv:2305.01558v1 [econ.GN])",
    "abstract": "Based on the panel data of 283 prefecture-level cities in China from 2006 to 2019, this paper measures the extent and mechanism of the impact of RMB real effective exchange rate fluctuations on carbon emission intensity. The results show that: (1) For every 1% appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of RMB, the carbon emission intensity decreases by an average of 0.463 tons/10000 yuan; (2) The \"carbon emission reduction effect\" of RMB real effective exchange rate appreciation is more obvious in the eastern regions, coastal areas, regions with high urbanization levels, and areas with open information; (3) The appreciation of RMB real effective exchange rate can reduce carbon dioxide emission intensity by improving regional R&D and innovation ability, restraining foreign trade and foreign investment, promoting industrial structure optimization and upgrading, and improving income inequality.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文基于2006年至2019年中国283个地级市的面板数据，测量了人民币实际有效汇率波动对碳排放强度的影响程度和机制。研究发现：（1）人民币实际有效汇率每升值1%，碳排放强度平均降低0.463吨/万元；（2）人民币实际有效汇率“碳减排效应”在东部地区、沿海地区、城市化水平高的地区和信息开放的地区更为明显；（3）人民币实际有效汇率的升值可以通过促进区域研发和创新能力、抑制外贸和外资、促进产业结构优化升级和改善收入不平等等多种途径，减少二氧化碳排放强度。",
