    "translated_abstract": "现在，虚假信息的不断传播及其惊人的影响已经促使行业和学术界开发出假新闻检测方法。然而，最先进的方法通常使用规模较小或特定主题的有限数据集进行训练。因此，这些模型缺乏泛化能力，不能应用于现实世界的数据。本文提出了三种采用并微调最先进的多模态Transformer进行多模态假新闻检测的模型。我们通过操作输入数据进行深入分析，旨在探索这些模型在社交媒体上的实际使用情况下的性能。我们跨多个模型进行的研究表明，这些系统在受到操作数据的情况下会出现显着的性能下降。为了减少偏差并提高模型的泛化能力，我们建议进行训练数据增强，以在社交媒体上进行更有意义的假新闻检测实验。",
