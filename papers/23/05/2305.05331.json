    "translated_abstract": "可解释的推荐系统能够解释其推荐决策，增强用户对系统的信任。大多数可解释的推荐系统要么依赖于人工标注的原理来训练模型以生成解释，要么利用注意机制从评论中提取重要的文本段落作为解释。提取的原理往往局限于单个评论，可能无法识别评论文本之外的隐含特征。为了避免昂贵的人工注释过程并生成超出单个评论的解释，我们建议将从用户-商品交互中学得的几何先验知识与变分网络相结合，该网络从用户-商品评论中推断潜在因子。单个用户-商品对的潜在因子可用于推荐和解释生成，自然地继承了编码在先验知识中的全局特征。三个电子商务数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的模型在推荐性能和可解释性方面都具有竞争力。",
