    "translated_abstract": "基于MRI的皮层表面分析是人类神经影像学中普遍存在的，例如用于皮层配准、分割或厚度估计。凹凸不平的皮层几何形状需要等距扫描（例如1mm MPRAGEs）和好的灰白质对比度进行3D重建。这排除了对于大多数出于临床目的而采集的脑部MRI扫描的分析。分析这些扫描将使神经影像学研究具备当前研究数据集无法实现的样本量，特别适用于少数族裔和罕见疾病的研究。本文提出了首个针对任何分辨率和脉冲序列的临床脑部MRI扫描进行皮层重建、配准、分割和厚度估计的方法。该方法包含学习组件和经典优化模块。前者使用领域随机化来训练CNN模型，以预测白质和脑外膜表面（符号距离函数）的隐式表示，达到等距的1mm的分辨率。",
