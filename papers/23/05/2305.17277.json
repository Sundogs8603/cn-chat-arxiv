    "translated_abstract": "最近，在学习有向无环图（DAGs）的背景下，出现了一类有趣的非凸优化问题。这些问题涉及到在给定损失或得分函数的情况下，最小化一个惩罚图中存在循环的非凸连续约束。在这项工作中，我们探讨了与这类非凸程序相关的优化挑战。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种双层算法，以新颖的方式利用非凸约束。算法的外层通过迭代地交换DAG的拓扑顺序中的节点对来优化拓扑顺序。我们方法的一个关键创新是，开发了一种有效的方法来为每次迭代生成一组候选交换对。在内层中，给定拓扑顺序，我们利用能够处理线性约束的现成求解器。我们所提出算法的主要优势是，它保证收敛到优化问题的一个稳定点，而现有方法可能会陷入亚最优解中。我们在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验证明了我们算法在学习高质量DAGs方面的有效性和效率。",
