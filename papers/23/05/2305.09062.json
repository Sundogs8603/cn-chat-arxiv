    "translated_abstract": "少样本学习是一项具有挑战性的研究领域，旨在仅利用少量标记数据样本学习新的概念。基于度量学习方法的最近工作利用元学习方法，其中包括支持（训练）和查询集（测试），旨在学习这些集合之间的相似性比较度量。由于数据缺乏，嵌入网络的学习过程成为少样本任务的重要部分。先前的工作使用度量学习方法解决了这个问题，但底层潜在空间的属性和类别之间的可分性并未完全强制执行。在这项工作中，我们提出了两种不同的损失函数，通过考虑少量数据之间的类内距离和类间距离来考虑嵌入向量的重要性。第一个损失函数是Proto-Triplet Loss，它基于原始三元组损失，并添加了原型向量。第二个损失函数是SuSana Distance Loss，它考虑了同类样本和不同类样本之间的距离。我们在两个少样本图像分类的基准数据集上评估了我们提出的方法，实验结果证明了我们的方法在实现类别可分性和达到最先进性能方面的有效性。",
