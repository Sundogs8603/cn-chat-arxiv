    "translated_abstract": "在过去的半个世纪中，有几次曾宣布人类历史将被人工智能（AI）彻底改变的虚假黎明。作者们认为，AI时代终于到来了。强大的图像生成器，如DALL-E2和Midjourney，突然间使得任何有权限的人们都可以轻松地创作出富有复杂性的艺术品。类似地，文本生成器，如GPT3.5(包括ChatGPT)和BLOOM，可以让用户撰写有关许多感兴趣的主题的详细写作描述。现在，即使是没有编写软件方面广泛专业知识的人也可以使用AI来生成可以实现无数应用程序的代码。虽然AI将继续发展和改进，可能是以极快的速度，但当前的AI状态已经在许多不同的社会部门带来了深刻的变革。每一种新技术都挑战着人类明智地进行治理的能力。然而，治理通常被认为是可能的和必要的。在AI的情况下，治理由于透明度、问责制和公平性等问题而变得复杂。本文探讨了AI治理，由AI治理和为AI治理的想法，认为AI本身可以在实现有效治理技术方面起到重要作用。作者提出了一种治理模式，涉及人类和AI之间的合作，各自发挥其各自的优势。",
