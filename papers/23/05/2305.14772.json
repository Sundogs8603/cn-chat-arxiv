    "abstract": "Many real-world applications require surfacing extracted snippets to users, whether motivated by assistive tools for literature surveys or document cross-referencing, or needs to mitigate and recover from model generated inaccuracies., Yet, these passages can be difficult to consume when divorced from their original document context. In this work, we explore the limits of LLMs to perform decontextualization of document snippets in user-facing scenarios, focusing on two real-world settings - question answering and citation context previews for scientific documents. We propose a question-answering framework for decontextualization that allows for better handling of user information needs and preferences when determining the scope of rewriting. We present results showing state-of-the-art LLMs under our framework remain competitive with end-to-end approaches. We also explore incorporating user preferences into the system, finding our framework allows for controllability.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多真实场景下的应用需要将提取的摘录展示给用户，这些摘录往往需要解耦原来的文本才能更好地呈现给用户。本文研究了LLMs在问答和引证上的去文本化能力，并提出了一个基于问答的去文本化框架，该框架可以更好地满足用户信息需求及偏好，并且在结果上表现出类似于端到端方法的竞争力。我们同时探讨了如何通过该框架将用户偏好融入到系统中，从而实现了可控性。",
