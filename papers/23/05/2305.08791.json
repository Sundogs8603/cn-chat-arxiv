    "translated_abstract": "社交网络上的信息传播已经十分普遍。影响力最大化 (IM) 算法的目的是识别那些在获得信息后将在社交网络上产生最大传播的个体，并且这些算法主要是针对营销而开发的。在具有社区结构的社交网络中，IM 算法仅着眼于最大化传播，可能导致不同社区间信息覆盖差异显著，这在公共卫生传播等情境下是不利的。虽然有些 IM 算法旨在通过节点属性来解决信息覆盖的不平衡现象，但是没有使用网络本身的实验社区结构，而这可能是有益的，因为社区直接影响信息的传播。此外，使用实验网络结构可以利用社区检测技术，在没有相关节点属性可用时运行公平感知算法。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种能够考虑社区结构的影响力最大化算法，在信息传播过程中，能够保证不同社区间的信息覆盖差异不会过大。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an influence maximization algorithm that considers the community structure, which aims to ensure that there are no significant disparities in information coverage between different communities during the information dissemination process. This is particularly important in public health messaging."
