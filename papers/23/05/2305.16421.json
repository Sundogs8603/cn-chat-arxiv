    "translated_abstract": "链路预测是计算图网络中边存在概率的过程。传统方法计算静态网络中给定节点的相似度，而最近的研究侧重于评估动态演化的网络。尽管深度学习技术和网络表示学习算法（例如node2vec）在预测准确性方面表现出卓越的改进，但node2vec中的随机梯度下降（SGD）方法由于缺乏先前的网络信息而易陷入平庸的本地最优值，导致无法捕捉网络的全局结构。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了NODDLE（NOde2vec和Deep Learning mEthod的集成）深度学习模型，该模型融合了node2vec提取的特征，并将其馈送到四层隐藏神经网络中。NODDLE利用自适应学习优化器（如Adam，Adamax，Adadelta和Adagrad）来提高性能。",
