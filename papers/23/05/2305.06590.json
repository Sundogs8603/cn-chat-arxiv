    "translated_abstract": "在现实应用中，知识图谱（KG）在各种领域（如医疗应用和对话代理）中被广泛使用。然而，在事实验证方面，KG尚未充分利用作为知识源。KG可以成为事实验证的有价值的知识来源，因为它们具有可靠性和广泛的适用性。KG由节点和边组成，清晰地展示了概念之间的联系，使得机器可以推理出一系列主题。然而，理解这些机器可读的概念如何映射到文本中的信息存在许多挑战。为了使社区更好地利用KG，我们介绍了一个新的数据集，FactKG:通过知识图谱推理进行事实验证，它包含108k个自然语言声明以及五种推理类型：单跳、合取、存在、多跳和否定。此外，FactKG包含各种语言模式，包括口语风格的声明和书面风格的声明，以提高实用性。",
