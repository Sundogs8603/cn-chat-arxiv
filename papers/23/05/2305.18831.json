    "translated_abstract": "在许多信号与生物医学数据的机器学习应用中，尤其是在脑电图 (EEG) 中，一个主要的挑战是数据在受试者、会话和硬件设备上的变异性。本文提出了一种新方法，称为卷积蒙日映射归一化 (CMMN)，其核心是根据训练数据估计Wasserstein barycenter，通过滤波信号以适应其功率谱密度 (PSD)。CMMN 基于新的闭式解，提供了最优输运映射和 barycenters，并提供了个体测试时间适应新数据的功能，而无需重新训练预测模型。通过对睡眠 EEG 数据的数值实验表明，CMMN 在适应受试者、会话甚至在使用不同硬件收集的数据集之间，都能带来显著且一致的性能提升，且其性能提升与数值密集的域适应 (DA) 相当。",
