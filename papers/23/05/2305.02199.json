    "translated_abstract": "本文致力于基于扩散磁共振图像提取的大脑连接数据的分类。我们提出了一种基于图卷积网络（GCN）的机器学习模型，该模型采用多头并行GCN机制，分别对大脑连接输入图进行处理。所提出的网络是一种简单的设计，采用不同的头部，涉及边缘和节点的图卷积，充分捕捉输入数据的表示。为了测试我们的模型从大脑连接数据中提取互补和代表性特征的能力，我们选择了性别分类任务。这表征了连接组在性别方面的变化程度，这对于提高我们对两性健康和疾病理解至关重要。本文在两个公开数据集PREVENT-AD（347个受试者）和OASIS3（771个受试者）上进行实验。结果表明，所提出的模型表现最佳。",
