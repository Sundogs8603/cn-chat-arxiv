    "abstract": "Predicting market movements based on the sentiment of news media has a long tradition in data analysis. With advances in natural language processing, transformer architectures have emerged that enable contextually aware sentiment classification. Nevertheless, current methods built for the general financial market such as FinBERT cannot distinguish asset-specific value-driving factors. This paper addresses this shortcoming by presenting a method that identifies and classifies events that impact supply and demand in the crude oil markets within a large corpus of relevant news headlines. We then introduce CrudeBERT, a new sentiment analysis model that draws upon these events to contextualize and fine-tune FinBERT, thereby yielding improved sentiment classifications for headlines related to the crude oil futures market. An extensive evaluation demonstrates that CrudeBERT outperforms proprietary and open-source solutions in the domain of crude oil.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于新闻媒体情感来预测市场走向在数据分析中已有悠久传统。随着自然语言处理的进步，出现了可进行上下文感知情感分类的Transformer架构。然而，当前为金融市场制定的方法，如FinBERT，无法区分影响特定资产价值驱动因素。本文通过在大量相关新闻头条中识别和分类影响原油市场供需的事件，介绍了一种解决此问题的方法。我们随后提出了CrudeBERT，这是一个依据这些事件来上下文化并优化FinBERT的情感分析模型，从而提供与原油期货市场相关的标题的情感分类的改进表现。一项广泛的评估展示了CrudeBERT在原油领域胜过专有和开源解决方案。",
