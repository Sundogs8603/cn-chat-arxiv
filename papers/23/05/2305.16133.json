    "translated_abstract": "语义占据预测旨在推断出自主代理在三维环境中操作的密集几何和语义。现有的占据预测方法几乎完全是基于人工注释的体积数据进行训练的。虽然这些数据有高质量，但是生成这些三维注释是费力且成本高昂的，限制了它们仅可以训练少量特定物体类别的数据集。为了解决这一限制，本文提出了一种新颖的方法：开放词汇占据（OVO），允许任意类别的语义占据预测，但在训练过程中无需三维注释。我们方法的关键是：（1）从预训练的二维开放词汇分割模型到三维占据网络的知识蒸馏，（2）像素 - 体素过滤以生成高质量的训练数据。该框架简单、紧凑且兼容大多数最先进的语义占据预测模型。在 NYUv2 和 SemanticKIT 上的实验显示出该方法的有效性。",
