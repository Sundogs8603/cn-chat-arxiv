    "abstract": "Deep ensembles achieved state-of-the-art results in classification and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection; however, their effectiveness remains limited due to the homogeneity of learned patterns within the ensemble. To overcome this challenge, our study introduces a novel approach that promotes diversity among ensemble members by leveraging saliency maps. By incorporating saliency map diversification, our method outperforms conventional ensemble techniques in multiple classification and OOD detection tasks, while also improving calibration. Experiments on well-established OpenOOD benchmarks highlight the potential of our method in practical applications.",
