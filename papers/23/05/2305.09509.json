    "translated_abstract": "跨领域方面基于情感分析旨在通过从源领域转移知识来在目标领域上执行各种细粒度情感分析任务。由于标记数据只存在于源域中，因此期望模型能够弥合域间差距以处理跨领域方面基于情感分析。虽然域适应方法已被证明是有效的，但它们大多基于判别式模型，并且需要针对不同的基于方面的情感分析任务进行特定的设计。为了提供更通用的解决方案，我们提出了一个统一的双向生成框架来处理各种跨领域方面基于情感分析任务。具体而言，我们的框架在文本到标签和标签到文本两个方向上训练了一个生成模型。前者将每个任务转换为统一的格式以学习域不可知特征，后者从噪声标签中生成自然语句进行数据增强，从而可以训练出更精确的模型。为了研究我们的框架的有效性和通用性，我们在几个基准数据集上进行了广泛的实验，并将我们的方法与最先进的方法进行了比较。实验结果表明，我们的方法可以在保持良好的通用性的同时明显优于现有的方法。",
