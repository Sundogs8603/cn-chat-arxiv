    "translated_abstract": "大量的数据是数据驱动推荐模型的基础。数据异质性是大数据的内在特性，在现实推荐系统中广泛存在。它反映了子人口群体之间属性的差异。忽略推荐数据的异质性可能会限制推荐模型的性能，损害子人口的鲁棒性，并使模型误导数据偏见。然而，数据异质性在推荐界并没有受到足够的关注。因此，它激发我们充分探索和利用异质性来解决上述问题并辅助数据分析。在本文中，我们着重探讨了推荐数据中两类典型的异质性，即预测机制和协变量分布的异质性，并提出了一种通过双层聚类方法探索异质性的算法。此外，通过迁移学习机制利用了挖掘出来的异质性。在基准数据集上进行的实验表明，我们的方法优于现有的基准方法。",
