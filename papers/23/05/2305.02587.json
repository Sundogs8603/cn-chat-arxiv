    "translated_abstract": "雇主声誉对劳动市场有何影响？我们使用从Glassdoor.com中收集的评论和Dice.com中的求职数据来研究这个问题。Glassdoor.com等劳动市场的机构通过众包来收集雇主信息，以解决工人在选择雇主时面临的信息问题。为了避免过多偏差，原始的众包雇主评级是在显示给求职者时进行了精加工后的。通过利用精加工的阈值，我们使用回归不连续性框架确定了Glassdoor评级的因果影响。我们记录了这种评级对劳动力市场需求和供给方面的影响。我们发现，雇主声誉对于雇主吸引工人的能力有影响，特别是当显示评分为“持续”时。雇主对评分超过精加工阈值的回应是发布更多的新职位和重新激活更多的工作职位。这种影响对私人、较小和不那么知名的企业最为突出。",

The results suggest that an increase in employer reputation can affect an employer's ability to attract workers, especially when the displayed rating is \"sticky,\" and this effect is most prominent for private, smaller, and less established companies."
