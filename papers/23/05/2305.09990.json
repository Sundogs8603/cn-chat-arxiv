    "translated_abstract": "文本生成是多模态任务导向对话系统中的一个基本任务。尽管现有的研究已经取得了丰硕的进展，但仍存在两个关键限制：1）注重属性知识，但忽略了可以揭示不同实体之间相关性的关系知识，从而促进了响应生成；2）只进行基于交叉熵损失的输出级监督，缺乏表示级的规范化。为了解决这些限制，我们设计了一种新颖的多模态任务导向对话系统（名为MDS-S2）。特别是，MDS-S2首先同时从知识库中获取与上下文相关的属性和关系知识，其中非直观的关系知识是通过n跳图形遍历提取的。此后，考虑到属性知识和关系知识可以有助于响应不同级别的问题，我们设计了一种多级知识组合机制来有效地融合它们。此外，为了强制属性关系一致性并提高响应的多样性，我们提出了一种新颖的表示级规范化方法，专门针对双重语义知识组合的模型。在两个基准数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，我们提出的方法在自动评估指标和人类评估方面均具有优越性。",

    "en_tdlr": "A novel multimodal task-oriented dialog system called MDS-S2 is proposed, which acquires context related attribute and relation knowledge through a knowledge base. A multi-level knowledge composition mechanism and a novel representation-level regularization method are designed to effectively fuse the acquired knowledge and improve response generation. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method."
