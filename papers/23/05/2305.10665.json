    "translated_abstract": "通常情况下，不受限制的对抗攻击会操纵图像的语义内容（如颜色或纹理）来创建既有效又逼真的对抗性样本，证明了它们具有欺骗人类感知和深度神经网络的隐蔽性和成功性。然而，当前的作品通常会牺牲不受限制的程度并主观地选择一些图像内容来保证不受限制的对抗样本的逼真性，从而限制了它的攻击性能。为保证对抗样本的逼真性和提高攻击性能，我们提出了一种新的不受限制攻击框架，称为基于内容的不受限制的对抗攻击。通过利用表示自然图像的低维流形将图像映射到流形上，并沿着其对抗方向进行优化。因此，在该框架内，我们实现了基于稳定扩散的对抗内容攻击，并生成了高可转移的逼真的不受限制的对抗性样本，可以有效攻击各种深度神经网络。",
