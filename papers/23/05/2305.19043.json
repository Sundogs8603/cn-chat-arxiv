    "translated_abstract": "基于扩散的流形学习方法在处理现代高维、高通量、噪声数据集的表示学习和降维中已经证明非常有用，特别是在生物学和物理学等领域。虽然人们认为这些方法通过学习测地线距离的代理来保持数据的底层流形结构，但没有确切的理论联系。在本文中，我们通过黎曼流形上的结果建立了这样的联系，明确了热扩散与流形距离之间的关系。在此过程中，我们还提出了一种更普遍的基于热核的流形嵌入方法，称为热测地线嵌入。这种新颖的视角使流形学习和去噪中的选择更加清晰。结果表明，我们的方法在保持基准流形距离和保持玩具数据集中的簇结构方面优于现有的最先进方法。我们还展示了单细胞RNA测序数据上的应用。",

The method, named heat geodesic embeddings, outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques in preserving ground truth manifold distances and cluster structure in toy datasets. It also showed promising results when applied to single cell RNA-sequencing data."
