    "translated_abstract": "在生物医学领域中，有监督的命名实体识别（NER）依赖于具有给定命名实体的大量注释文本，其创建可能耗时且昂贵。此外，提取新实体通常需要进行额外的注释任务和重新训练模型。为解决这些挑战，本文提出了一种基于Transformer的生物医学领域零样本和少样本NER方法。该方法基于将多类标记分类任务转换为二元标记分类（标记包含搜索的实体或不包含搜索的实体），并在更多的数据集和生物医学实体上进行预训练，从而可学习到给定和潜在类别之间的语义关系。在9种不同的生物医学实体上，我们在零样本NER、一次样本NER、10次样本NER和100次样本NER上实现了平均F1得分分别为35.44％、50.10％、69.94％和79.51％。",

The method utilizes pre-training to learn the semantic relations between the given and potential classes, and transforms the multi-class token classification task into binary token classification. It achieves good performance in different sample sizes."
