    "abstract": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a leading cause of global deaths, necessitating a focus on primary prevention and lifestyle behavior change. Health coaching, coupled with Question Answering (QA) systems, has the potential to transform preventive healthcare. This paper presents a human-Artificial Intelligence (AI) health coaching model incorporating a domain-specific extractive QA system. A sleep-focused dataset, SleepQA, was manually assembled and used to fine-tune domain-specific BERT models. The QA system was evaluated using automatic and human methods. A data-centric framework enhanced the system's performance by improving passage retrieval and question reformulation. Although the system did not outperform the baseline in automatic evaluation, it excelled in the human evaluation of real-world questions. Integration into a Human-AI health coaching model was tested in a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).",

    "translated_abstract": "非传染性疾病 (NCDs) 是全球死亡的主要原因，需要关注初级预防和生活方式行为改变。 健康辅导和问答 (QA) 系统结合起来，有潜力改变预防保健。 本文提出了一个人工智能健康辅导模型，其中包括一个具有特定领域的提取式 QA 系统。 睡眠相关数据集 SleepQA 被手动组装并用于微调特定领域的 BERT 模型。 该 QA 系统使用自动和人类方法进行评估。 数据中心化框架通过改进段落检索和问题改写提高了系统性能。 尽管该系统在自动评估中未超越基线，但在真实世界问题的人工评估中表现出色。 在随机对照试验的试点测试中验证了将其集成到人工智能健康辅导模型中。",
