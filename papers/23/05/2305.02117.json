    "translated_abstract": "集体决策对于信息与通信系统至关重要。决策代理人之间的冲突阻碍了整个系统潜在效用的最大化。量子过程可以利用光子的纠缠或轨道角动量的量子干涉，实现两个代理人之间的无冲突联合决策。然而，以前 的研究一直呈现对称的联合决策结果。虽然这个属性有助于维护和保护平等，但它不能解决不平等问题。伦理和公平等全球性挑战在负责任的人工智能领域被认为是负责任的研究和创新范例。因此，决策系统不仅必须保持现有的平等，还必须解决不平等问题。本研究从理论和数值上探讨了利用携带轨道角动量的光子或纠缠光子的量子干涉实现非对称集体决策。虽然成功实现了不对称性，但所得的联合决策可以在保持决策公平性的同时实现更高的效用。该研究为设计量子决策协议提供了新的视角，并具有潜在的量子通讯和加密应用。",
