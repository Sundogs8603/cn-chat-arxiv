    "abstract": "Goal-directed dialogue systems aim to proactively reach a pre-determined target through multi-turn conversations. The key to achieving this task lies in planning dialogue paths that smoothly and coherently direct conversations towards the target. However, this is a challenging and under-explored task. In this work, we propose a coherent dialogue planning approach that uses a stochastic process to model the temporal dynamics of dialogue paths. We define a latent space that captures the coherence of goal-directed behavior using a Brownian bridge process, which allows us to incorporate user feedback flexibly in dialogue planning. Based on the derived latent trajectories, we generate dialogue paths explicitly using pre-trained language models. We finally employ these paths as natural language prompts to guide dialogue generation. Our experiments show that our approach generates more coherent utterances and achieves the goal with a higher success rate.",

    "translated_abstract": "目标导向型对话系统旨在通过多轮对话主动地达到预先确定的目标。实现此任务的关键在于规划对话路径，使其平稳并连贯地指向目标。然而，这是一项具有挑战性并未被深入探究的任务。在本文中，我们提出了一种连贯对话规划方法，它使用随机过程来建模对话路径的时间动态。我们定义了一个潜在空间，通过布朗桥过程捕捉了目标导向行为的连贯性，从而允许我们灵活地将用户反馈纳入对话规划。基于导出的潜在轨迹，我们使用预先训练的语言模型显式地生成对话路径。最后，我们将这些路径作为自然语言提示来引导对话生成。我们的实验表明，我们的方法生成了更连贯的话语，并以更高的成功率实现了目标。",
