    "translated_abstract": "大语言模型（LLMs）可以生成携带各种滥用风险的文本，包括抄袭、在电子商务平台上发布虚假评论，或者制作引人注目的虚假推文。因此，检测文本是否由机器生成变得越来越重要。虽然现有的检测方法表现出色，但由于严重依赖训练数据，它们往往缺乏泛化能力。为缓解这一问题，我们提出了一种与模型相关的生成文本检测方法，即LLM亲子鉴定（LLM-Pat）。具体而言，给定任何候选文本（\"子类\"），LLM-Pat使用一个中间LLM（\"父类\"）重建与给定文本对应的\"兄弟\"文本，然后衡量候选文本与其\"兄弟\"文本之间的相似性。高相似性表明候选文本是由机器生成，类似于基因特征。我们已构建了数据集...",
