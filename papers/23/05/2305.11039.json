    "translated_abstract": "最近人工智能和机器学习算法的发展以及更快的计算基础设施的可用性，通过开发机器学习辅助的网络入侵检测系统（NIDS），增强了网络安全操作中心（防御者）的安全姿态。与此同时，攻击者利用AI / ML模型的支持也增加了逃避安全检测的能力。因此，防御者需要积极准备针对利用NIDS检测机制的逃避攻击。最近的研究发现，对基于流和基于数据包的特征进行扰动可以欺骗机器学习模型，但这些方法存在局限性。对流基础特征进行扰动难以逆向工程，而使用对数据包特征进行扰动的样本不可重现。我们的方法框架“Deep PackGen”利用深度强化学习生成对抗性数据包，并旨在超越现有对抗生成性技术的局限性，提高生成对抗网络数据包的效果。",
