    "translated_abstract": "本论文介绍了基于随机特征的图形随机特征（GRFs）机制。GRFs可以用于构建针对图节点定义的多个重要内核的无偏随机估计器，特别是正则化拉普拉斯内核。与非图形内核的常规RF一样，它们提供了手段来将定义在图上的内核方法扩展到更大的网络。重要的是，它们在应用于下游应用时，对于较小的图也提供了大幅的计算收益。因此，GRFs解决了图内核算法时间复杂度是节点数的立方的问题。我们提供了GRFs的详细理论分析和广泛的实证评估：从速度测试，通过弗罗贝尼乌斯相对误差分析到使用图内核进行kmeans图聚类。我们展示了GRFs计算中存在着一个令人尴尬简单的分布式算法，可以应用于需要分割的图。",
