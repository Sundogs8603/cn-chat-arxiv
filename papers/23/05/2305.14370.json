Many machine learning algorithms have been developed to predict and prevent this disease, and they can potentially be implemented in the diagnosis of individuals who have it. This survey aims to review papers that have focused on the use of deep learning to detect and predict schizophrenia using EEG signals, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). With our chosen search strategy, we assessed ten publications from 2019 to 2022. All studies achieved successful predictions of more than 80%.

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在医疗保健中被用于推断人类疾病和心理健康问题的近似结论。与传统方法相比，它可以更有效地分析数据，并产生更好、更可靠的结果。精神分裂症是一种慢性精神障碍，影响数百万人的生活。许多机器学习算法已经被开发用于预测和预防这种疾病，并有可能用于诊断患有该疾病的个人。本调查旨在回顾使用深度学习来检测和预测精神分裂症的论文，使用了脑电图（EEG）、功能性磁共振成像（fMRI）和弥散磁共振成像（dMRI）。我们选择检索策略，评估了2019年至2022年的十篇论文。所有研究都成功预测了80%以上。本综述提供了这些研究的摘要并进行了比较。",
