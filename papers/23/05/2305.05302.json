    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了计算模型，分析法庭陈述以评估以色列法院系统对性暴力受害者的司法态度。该研究考察了“强奸神话”在刑事司法系统对性犯罪的反应中的共鸣，特别是在对受害者可信度的司法评估中。我们首先制定了一个本体论来评估法官对受害者可信度的态度，具有八个序数标签和二元分类。其次，我们策划了一个手动注释的数据集，用于希伯来语中法官对受害者可信度的评估，以及一个可以从法院判决案件中提取可信度标签的模型。该数据集包括1990年至2021年的855个性侵犯案件的判决文书，由法律专家和受过训练的法学生帮助注释。该模型使用句法和潜在结构的组合方法，找到传达法官对受害者态度的句子，并对其进行分类。",
