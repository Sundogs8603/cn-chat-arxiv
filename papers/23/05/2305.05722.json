    "abstract": "Class imbalance problems widely exist in the medical field and heavily deteriorates performance of clinical predictive models. Most techniques to alleviate the problem rebalance class proportions and they predominantly assume the rebalanced proportions should be a function of the original data and oblivious to the model one uses. This work challenges this prevailing assumption and proposes that links the optimal class proportions to the model complexity, thereby tuning the class proportions per model. Our experiments on the opioid overdose prediction problem highlight the performance gain of tuning class proportions. Rigorous regression analysis also confirms the advantages of the theoretical framework proposed and the statistically significant correlation between the hyperparameters controlling the model complexity and the optimal class proportions.",

    "translated_abstract": "类别不平衡问题在医疗领域广泛存在，严重破坏了临床预测模型的性能。大多数缓解问题的方法通过重新平衡类别比例来实现，它们主要假设重新平衡的比例应该是原始数据的函数，与所使用的模型无关。本文对这一流行假设提出了挑战，提出了将最佳类别比例与模型复杂度联系起来的理论框架，从而针对每种模型调整类别比例。我们在阿片类药物过量预测问题上的实验突出了调整类别比例的性能提升。严格的回归分析也证实了所提出的理论框架的优点，以及控制模型复杂度和最佳类别比例之间的超参数之间的统计显着相关性。",
