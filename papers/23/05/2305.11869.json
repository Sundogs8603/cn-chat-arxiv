    "translated_abstract": "即将到来的光度巡天将会发现数以万计的Ia型超新星(SNe Ia)，远远超过了我们的光谱资源容量。为了在没有光谱信息的情况下最大化观测数据的科学回报，我们必须只利用光度信息准确地提取关键参数，例如SN红移。我们提出了一种基于卷积神经网络的方法Photo-zSNthesis，用于从多波段超新星光变曲线预测完整的红移概率分布，并在模拟的SDSS和LSST数据以及观测到的SDSS SNe上进行了测试。我们展示了对现有方法进行的预测的显著改进，无论是在模拟还是实际观测中，且存在极少的红移相关偏差，这是由于选择效应(例如Malmquist偏差)而带来的挑战。该方法产生的概率密度函数能够得到很好的限制，并将最大程度地约束宇宙学。",
