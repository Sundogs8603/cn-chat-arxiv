To bridge the gap, we propose to shift the problem to the dynamic setting and ask: given the label-rich source graphs and the label-scarce target graphs observed in previous T timestamps, how can we effectively characterize the evolving domain discrepancy and optimize the generalization performance of the target domain at the incoming T+1 timestamp? To answer the question, for the first time, we propose a generalization bound under the setting of dynamic transfer learning across graphs, which implies the generalization performance is dominated by domain evolution",

    "translated_abstract": "在许多高风险领域中，跨图传输知识起着关键作用，包括运输网络、电子商务网络、神经科学和金融领域。我们提出了一个新问题：在动态设置下，考虑已观察到的具有标签的源图和标签稀疏的目标图，如何有效地表征不断变化的领域偏差，并优化目标域在下一个时间戳的泛化性能？为了回答这个问题，我们首次提出了跨图动态迁移学习设置下的一般化界限，这意味着泛化性能由领域演化控制。",
