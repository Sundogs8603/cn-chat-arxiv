    "translated_abstract": "在电子商务应用中，产品问答系统是提供顾客问题回答的关键，以帮助他们在购物时对产品进行了解。尽管现有的产品问答系统主要集中在英语上，但实际上需要支持多种语言的顾客，并利用英文版产品信息进行回答。为了研究这个实际的工业任务，我们提出了xPQA，一个跨9个分支的12种语言的大规模语言标注跨语言产品问答数据集，并报告了(1)候选答案的排名，以选择最佳的英文候选答案来回答非英语问题;和(2)回答生成，以基于选择的英文候选答案生成一个自然语言的非英语回答。我们评估了涉及机器翻译、多语言预训练语言模型等不同方法，包括或排除xPQA训练数据的运行时或离线。我们发现(1)域内数据是必不可少的，因为在其他领域训练的跨语言排名器性能下降；(2)虽然多语言预训练语言模型很有希望，但运行时翻译仍然必要。",

In experiments, the researchers found that in-domain data is indispensable, and while multilingual pre-trained language models are promising, on-the-fly translation is still necessary."
