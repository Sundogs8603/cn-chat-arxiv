    "translated_abstract": "颗粒球计算作为一种高效、稳健、可扩展的学习方法，已成为颗粒计算的研究热点。颗粒球计算包括两个阶段：颗粒球生成（GBG）和基于颗粒球（GB）的多粒度学习。然而，现有的GBG方法的稳定性和效率需要进一步提高，因为它们在很大程度上依赖于k均值或k分割。此外，基于GB的分类器仅单向考虑GB的几何特征构建分类规则，而忽视了GB的质量。因此，本文提出了一种快速稳定的基于关注机制的GBG（GBG++）方法。具体而言，所提出的GBG++方法仅需要在分割每个GB时计算从数据驱动的中心到未分割样本的距离，而不是随机选择中心并计算它到所有样本的距离。此外，引入了一种异常值检测方法。",
