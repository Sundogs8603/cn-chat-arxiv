In those contexts, feedback between team members is an important element to facilitate successful and sustainable teamwork. However, in the classroom, as the number of teams and team members and frequency of evaluation increase, the volume of comments can become overwhelming for an instructor to read and track, making it difficult to identify patterns and areas for student improvement. To address this challenge, we explored the use of generative AI models, specifically ChatGPT, to analyze student comments in team based learning contexts. Our study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT's ability to accurately identify topics in student comments based on an existing framework consisting of positive and negative comments.

    "translated_abstract": "团队合作是许多学术和专业环境中至关重要的组成部分。在这些情境下，团队成员之间的反馈是促进成功和可持续团队协作的重要元素。然而，在课堂上，随着团队数量和成员数量以及评估频率的增加，评论的数量可能会令教师无法阅读和跟踪，从而难以识别模式和学生改进的领域。为了解决这个挑战，我们探索了使用生成AI模型，具体来说是ChatGPT，分析团队学习环境下学生的评论。我们的研究旨在评估ChatGPT根据由积极和消极评论组成的现有框架，准确识别学生评论的能力。我们的结果表明，ChatGPT可以实现90％以上的标签精度，为分析团队项目的反馈提供了一个可能有价值的工具。本研究对学术界和实践界的团队项目反馈分析做出了贡献。",
