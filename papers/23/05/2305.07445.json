The application is designed to support non-native Arabic speakers in enhancing their pronunciation skills, while also helping native speakers mitigate any potential influence from regional dialects on their Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) pronunciation. QVoice employs various learning cues to aid learners in comprehending meaning, drawing connections with their existing knowledge of English language, and offers detailed feedback for pronunciation correction, along with contextual examples showcasing word usage. The learning cues featured in QVoice encompass a wide range of meaningful information, such as visualizations of phrases/words and their translations, as well as phonetic transcriptions and transliterations. QVoice provides pronunciation feedback at the character level and assesses performance at the word level.",
