In recent years, there has been a growing interest among researchers in developing and improving speech recognition systems to facilitate and enhance human-computer interaction. Today, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become ubiquitous, used in everything from games to translation systems, robots, and more. However, much research is still needed on speech recognition systems for low-resource languages. This article focuses on the recognition of individual words in the Dari language using the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) feature extraction method and three different deep neural network models: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), as well as two hybrid models combining CNN and RNN. We evaluate these models using an isolated Dari word corpus that we have created, consisting of 1000 utterances for 20 short Dari terms. Our study achieved ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文是我们之前会议论文的延伸。近年来，研究人员对于开发和改进语音识别系统以促进和增强人机交互的兴趣日益增长。如今，自动语音识别（ASR）系统已普及，并在游戏、翻译系统、机器人等方面使用。然而，关于低资源语言的语音识别系统仍需要大量研究。本文通过使用Mel频率倒谱系数（MFCCs）特征提取方法和三种不同的深度神经网络模型：卷积神经网络（CNN）、循环神经网络（RNN）和多层感知机（MLP），以及两种结合CNN和RNN的混合模型，来识别Dari语言中的单词。我们使用自己创建的孤立Dari词语语料库对这些模型进行评估，该语料库包括20个短语Dari词汇的1000个话语。研究结果显示，我们的模型取得了极高的识别准确率。",
