    "translated_abstract": "早期语言习得的建模旨在理解婴儿如何引导他们的语言技能。建模涵盖了用于训练模型的输入数据的属性，正在测试的认知假设及其算法实现，以及用于将模型与人类数据进行比较的评估方法。最近的进展使得计算模型使用更自然的训练数据成为可能。这也激发了开发更自然的模型行为测试的动机。实现这一目标的关键步骤是开发代表性的语音数据集，其中包括婴儿在其自然环境中听到的语音。然而，这种录音的一个主要缺点是它们通常是嘈杂的，目前尚不清楚声音质量如何影响基于这些数据进行的分析和建模实验。在本文中，我们探讨了婴儿导向语音（IDS）和成人导向语音（ADS）分析的这一方面。",
