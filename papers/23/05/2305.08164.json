    "translated_abstract": "理解时间序列数据的动态通常需要识别数据生成的唯一潜在因素，即潜在过程识别。由于两个主要挑战，即（i）复杂的数据结构（如时间依赖性）可能导致独立假设的违反，（ii）来自不同视角的因素通常是重叠的且难以聚合为完整的集合，因此，将现有工作扩展到多视角时间序列数据是一个非平凡的问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的框架MuLTI，它采用了对比学习技术来反演数据生成过程以增强可识别性。此外，MuLTI集成了一个排列机制，通过建立最优传输公式来合并相应的重叠变量。对合成和真实数据集的广泛实验结果表明，MuLTI在从多视角时间序列数据中识别潜在过程方面具有优越性能。",
