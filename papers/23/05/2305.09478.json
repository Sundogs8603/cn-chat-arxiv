    "translated_abstract": "脑电图（EEG）信号是极其复杂的脑活动的结果。通过例如一对电极信号在不同时间延迟（滞后$\\Delta$t）下的联合分布（$\\rho_{\\Delta t}$）可以访问这种隐藏动态的某些细节。标准方法是监视这样的联合分布的单一评估，例如Pearson相关（或互信息），然而这种方法结果通常相对不太有趣。相比之下，这样的复杂信号可能由多种类型的统计依赖关系构成。本文提出了一种自动分解和提取这些依赖关系的方法。 具体来说，我们将这样的联合分布建模为所有考虑的滞后依赖关系的多项式估计，然后通过PCA降维找到占主导的依赖关系方向$f_v$。这样我们得到一些滞后依赖特征$a_i(\\Delta t)$，用于描述各个滞后的统计依赖关系及其重要性。",

The method aims to capture the subtle dependencies in the complex brain activity reflected by EEG signals."
