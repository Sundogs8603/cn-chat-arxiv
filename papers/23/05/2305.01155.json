    "translated_abstract": "空管员和飞行员之间的语音交流对于确保安全和高效的空中交通管制（ATC）至关重要。这项任务需要空管员具有高度的警觉性并且可能是繁琐和容易出错的。最近，已经尝试将人工智能（AI）集成到ATC中，以减少空管员的工作量。然而，为ATC开发数据驱动的AI系统需要大规模的注释数据集，而该领域目前尚缺乏这些数据集。本文探讨了ATCO2项目的经验教训，该项目旨在开发一种唯一平台，以实时方式收集和预处理大量来自空域的ATC数据。通过拥有群众志愿者拥有的VHF接收器从公开可访问的无线电频率通道收集音频和监视数据，然后上传到Opensky网络服务器，这可以被视为“无限源”的数据。此外，本文还回顾了ATCO2以前的工作。",
