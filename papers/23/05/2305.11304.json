    "translated_abstract": "出现了各种概率时间序列预测模型并表现出了卓越的性能。然而，模型的选择高度依赖于输入时间序列的特征和模型基于的固定分布。由于概率分布不能直接平均不同模型，目前的时间序列模型集成方法不能直接用于提高预测的鲁棒性和准确性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了pTSE，一种基于隐马尔可夫模型的概率预测的多模型分布集成方法。pTSE只需从成员模型获取现成输出，不需要进一步了解每个模型的信息。此外，我们对pTSE进行了完整的理论分析，证明了时间序列经HMM处理后的经验分布几乎一定收敛于稳态分布。基准实验显示，与单个模型和其他最新集成方法相比，pTSE在准确性和鲁棒性方面具有优越性。",
