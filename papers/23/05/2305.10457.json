    "abstract": "Time series can describe a wide range of natural and social phenomena. A few samples are climate and seismic measures trends, stock prices, or website visits. Time-series clustering helps to find outliers that, related to these instances, could represent temperature anomalies, imminent volcanic eruptions, market disturbances, or fraudulent web traffic. Founded on the success of automatic feature extraction techniques, specifically employing random kernels, we develop a new method for time series clustering consisting of two steps. First, a random convolutional structure transforms the data into an enhanced feature representation. Afterwards, a clustering algorithm classifies the transformed data. The method improves state-of-the-art results on time series clustering benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "时间序列可描述广泛的自然和社会现象，如气候、地震、股票价格或网站访问趋势。时间序列聚类有助于找到异常值，这些异常值可能代表温度异常、火山爆发、市场干扰或欺诈性网站流量。基于自动特征提取技术的成功，特别是采用随机核技术，我们开发了一种新的时间序列聚类方法，包括两个步骤。首先，一个随机卷积结构将数据转换为增强的特征表示。然后，聚类算法对转换后的数据进行分类。该方法在时间序列聚类基准上改善了最先进的结果。",
