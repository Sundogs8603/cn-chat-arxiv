    "translated_abstract": "动态多目标优化(DMO)处理在不断变化的环境中具有多个（通常冲突的）目标的优化问题。这些问题对进化算法提出了各种挑战，进化算法通常被用来解决复杂的优化问题，由于其动态性和在变化环境中的资源限制。本文提出了向量自回归演化(VARE)，它由向量自回归(VAR)和环境感知超突变构成，以应对DMO中的环境变化。VARE构建了一种考虑决策变量之间的相互关系的VAR模型，以有效预测动态环境中的变化解。此外，VARE引入了环境感知超突变(EAH)来解决现有超突变策略在增加动态场景下的种群多样性时的盲目性，因为预测方法在这种情况下不适用。VAR和EAH的无缝集成以适应环境的方式使VARE能够有效处理广泛的问题。",
