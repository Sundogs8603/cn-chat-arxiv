How to analysis and train dataset to overcome overfitting is the core problem we should deal with. Meanwhile if there is the mult-task problem, we should also think about if we can take advantage of their correlation and estimate as fast as we can. In this track, Super Network builds a search space based on ViT-Base. The search space contain depth, num-heads, mpl-ratio and embed-dim. What we done firstly are pre-processing the data based on our understanding of this problem which can reduce complexity of problem and probability of over fitting. Then we tried different kind of models and different way to combine them. Finally we choose stacking ensemble models using GP-NAS with cross validation. Our stacking model ranked 1st in CVPR 2022 Track 2 Challenge.",

    "translated_abstract": "在小样本训练中准确预测体系结构的性能是一项重要但不容易的任务。如何分析和训练数据集以克服过度拟合是我们应该处理的核心问题。同时，如果存在多任务问题，我们还应该考虑是否可以利用它们之间的相关性，并尽快估计。在这项研究中，Super Network基于ViT-Base构建了一个搜索空间。搜索空间包含深度、头数、mpl-ratio和embed-dim。我们首先进行了基于我们对该问题的理解的数据预处理，可以降低问题的复杂度和过度拟合的概率。然后我们尝试了不同类型的模型和不同的组合方式。最后，我们选择使用GP-NAS和交叉验证的堆叠集成模型。我们的堆叠模型在CVPR 2022赛道2挑战赛中排名第1。",
