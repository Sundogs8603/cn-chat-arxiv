    "translated_abstract": "计算机辅助药物发现中的一个核心任务是采用已知的活性分子构建模型，以发现需要进一步筛选的有潜力分子。然而，通常只有非常少数的活性分子是已知的。因此，少样本学习方法有可能提高药物发现过程中这个关键阶段的效率。我们提出了一种新的少样本药物发现方法。其主要思想是通过已知的上下文或参考分子来丰富分子表示。我们的分子表示丰富新概念是通过现代 Hopfield 网络将支持集和查询集中的分子与大量的参考（上下文）分子相关联。直观地说，这个丰富步骤类似于人类专家将一个给定的分子与熟悉的其属性已知的分子相关联。这个丰富步骤增强并放大了数据的协方差结构，同时消除了大量标记数据的需求。我们在标准的少样本药物发现基准测试上对我们的方法进行了评估，并展示它优于现有的方法。",
