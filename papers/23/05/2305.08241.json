    "translated_abstract": "本研究以1分钟时间分辨率，对2018年至2022年间约1000只纽约证券交易所上市股票的交易价格进行了研究。测量每只股票在以交易量为加权的交易时间上，从布朗运动鞅中偏离的情况，时间尺度为分钟至数日。结果很好地符合了具有哈斯特指数0.465的幂律脉冲噪声（或高斯）过程，即略微均值回归。通过对模拟的哈斯特指数数据进行套利策略测试，以及对实际数据进行回测的可比较策略，获得了类似的结果（如果没有交易成本，年化收益约为60％）。接下来，通过检查约1000只股票的交叉相关结构，我们发现，引人注目的是，相关性随着时间滞后范围的增加而增加。我们展示了如果每只股票的均值回归哈斯特分量是不相关的，即不共享th.kolmogorov-smirnov test，那么可以量化地解释这种行为。",

    "en_tdlr": "The research reveals that the price-time relationship of NYSE listed stocks is arbitrageable, as demonstrated through simulated and actual data. The study also finds that the correlations between stocks increase with time lag, and attributes this behavior to the uncorrelated mean-reverting Hurst component of each stock."
