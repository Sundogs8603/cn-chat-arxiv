    "translated_abstract": "设计生物序列是一个重要的挑战，需要满足复杂的限制，因此使用深度生成模型来解决是很自然的问题。扩散生成模型在许多应用中取得了相当大的成功。基于分数的生成随机微分方程（SDE）模型是一种连续时间扩散模型框架，具有许多优点，但最初提出的SDE不是自然地用于建模离散数据。为了开发适用于离散数据（例如生物序列）的生成SDE模型，我们在概率单纯形空间中引入了一种扩散过程，其中随机分布的平稳分布是Dirichlet分布。这使得在连续空间中进行扩散对于建模离散数据是自然的。我们称这种方法为Dirchlet扩散分数模型。我们通过数独生成任务证明了这种技术可以生成满足严格限制的样本。这种生成模型也可以用于生成生物序列。",
