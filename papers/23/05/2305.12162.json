    "translated_abstract": "自动拍卖设计旨在通过机器学习寻找经验上高收入的机制。现有的多物品拍卖情景的工作可以粗略地分为RegretNet类和仿射极大价（AMAs）方法。然而，前者不能严格保证占优策略激励兼容性（DSIC），而后者因为分配候选人数过多而面临可扩展性问题。为解决这些限制，我们提出了AMenuNet，一种可扩展的神经网络，它从出价人和物品表示中构造AMA参数（甚至包括分配菜单）。由于AMA的属性，AMenuNet始终是DSIC和个人理性（IR）的，通过神经网络生成候选分配来增强可伸缩性。此外，AMenuNet是置换等变的，其参数数量不受拍卖规模的影响。我们进行了大量实验，证明AMenuNet在协商一致的价值和社会残余价值方面优于强基线模型。",
