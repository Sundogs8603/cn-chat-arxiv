    "translated_abstract": "虽然领域泛化（DG）问题在二维图像任务中增长迅速，但其在三维点云数据上的探索仍然不足，并且受到更复杂和不确定的跨域差异以及不均匀的跨类模态分布的挑战。与之前的二维 DG 工作不同，本文关注三维 DG 问题，并提出了一种 Single-dataset Unified Generalization（SUG）框架，该框架仅利用单个源数据集来缓解经过充分训练的源模型面临的未知域差异。具体来说，首先设计了一种多细粒度子域对齐（MSA）方法，通过在来自单个源数据集的分裂子域之间执行多细粒度特征对齐过程来约束学习表示为域不可知和有区别性。然后，提出了一种样本级域感知注意力（SDA）策略，该策略可以根据每个样本所属的不同子域选择性地增强易于适应的样本。",
