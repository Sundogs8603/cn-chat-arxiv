    "translated_abstract": "最近，量子机器学习（QML）取得了巨大的进展，其中量子支持向量机（QSVM）成为了一种有前途的模型。本文重点关注两种现有的QSVM方法：量子核支持向量机（QK-SVM）和量子变分支持向量机（QV-SVM）。虽然两种方法均取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但我们提出了一种新的方法，即量子变分核支持向量机（QVK-SVM），以增强准确性，融合了QK-SVM和QV-SVM的优点。我们在鸢尾花数据集上进行了广泛的实验，发现QVK-SVM在准确性、损失和混淆矩阵指标方面均优于现有模型。我们的结果表明，QVK-SVM作为一种可靠的、具有变革性的QML应用工具具有巨大的潜力。因此，我们建议在未来的QML研究中采用它。",
