    "abstract": "Mobility-on-demand (MoD) systems consist of a fleet of shared vehicles that can be hailed for one-way point-to-point trips. The total distance driven by the vehicles and the fleet size can be reduced by employing ridesharing, i.e., by assigning multiple passengers to one vehicle. However, finding the optimal passenger-vehicle assignment in an MoD system is a hard combinatorial problem. In this work, we demonstrate how the VGA method, a recently proposed systematic method for ridesharing, can be used to compute the optimal passenger-vehicle assignments and corresponding vehicle routes in a massive-scale MoD system. In contrast to existing works, we solve all passenger-vehicle assignment problems to optimality, regularly dealing with instances containing thousands of vehicles and passengers. Moreover, to examine the impact of using optimal ridesharing assignments, we compare the performance of an MoD system that uses optimal assignments against an MoD system that uses assignments compute",

    "translated_abstract": "流动出行（MoD）系统由一群共享汽车组成，可用于单程点对点的乘坐。通过使用拼车，即将多名乘客分配到一辆车上，可以减少车辆和车队的行驶总里程。然而，在MoD系统中找到最优的乘客-车辆分配是一个困难的组合问题。本文介绍了一个名为VGA方法的最近提出的拼车系统方法，该方法可以用于计算大规模MoD系统中的最优乘客-车辆分配和相应的车辆路径。与现有的研究相比，我们解决了所有乘客-车辆分配问题，定期处理包含成千上万辆车和乘客的实例。此外，为了检查使用最优拼车分配的影响，我们比较了使用最优分配的MoD系统与使用普通分配的MoD系统的性能。",
