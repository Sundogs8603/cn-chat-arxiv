    "translated_abstract": "电子健康记录（EHR）数据包含病人的诊断、药物、治疗等医疗记录。这些数据通常被视为敏感的医疗信息。因此，医疗中心的EHR数据通常不能被共享，这使得使用多个中心的EHR数据创建预测模型变得困难，而这对于模型的强健性和普适性至关重要。联邦学习是一种算法方法，可以在多个位置的数据上学习共享模型，而无需将所有数据存储在中心位置。我们提出了一种联邦学习方法来学习医疗概念嵌入。这个预训练模型叫做BEHRT，是在一个大型EHR数据语料库上训练的，它将医疗概念编码成高维向量。我们的方法可以在多个医疗中心的EHR数据中获取医疗概念的嵌入，而不需要在它们之间交换记录。我们将模型应用于一个实际的预测任务，使用多个中心的EHR数据来预测下一次诊断，实验结果证明了我们方法的有效性。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种基于BEHRT的联邦学习方法来学习医疗概念嵌入，在不传输任何隐私数据的情况下，实现了多个医疗中心的EHR数据的共同学习。实验证明该方法在预测病人下一次诊断方面有效。",
