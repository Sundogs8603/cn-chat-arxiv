    "translated_abstract": "随着对开源软件的日益依赖，用户暴露于第三方库漏洞之中。为了提醒用户此类漏洞，已经开发了软件组成分析（SCA）工具。SCA需要确定漏洞修复提交。以前的工作已经提出了可以自动识别这样的漏洞修复提交的方法。然而，鉴定这样的提交是极具挑战性的，因为只有极少数提交是漏洞修复。此外，代码更改可能是嘈杂且难以分析的。我们观察到，噪声可以出现在不同层次的细节中，使得准确检测漏洞修复变得极具挑战性。为了应对这些挑战并提高以前工作的有效性，我们提出了MiDas（漏洞修复的多粒度检测器）。MiDas与以前的工作不同，它为每个代码更改粒度级别构建不同的神经网络，分别对应于提交级别、文件级别、碎片级别。",
