    "translated_abstract": "在精准农业中，检测高产农田是一项必要的实践，使得农民可以单独评估操作绩效并比较不同的种子品种、农药和肥料。然而，手动识别高产农田往往是一项耗时且容易出错的任务。以往的研究尝试使用先进的机器学习算法检测农田，但往往缺乏高质量的标记数据。在这种情况下，我们提出了一个高质量的数据集，它是通过机器操作结合随着时间推移而跟踪的Sentinel-2图像生成的。据我们所知，这是第一个通过使用这种技术克服标记样本不足的数据集。接着，我们应用半监督无标签数据分类和最先进的有监督和自监督深度学习方法来自动检测高产农田。最终结果表明在正无标记学习中具有很高的准确性，这非常适合",
