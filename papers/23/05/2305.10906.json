    "translated_abstract": "DNN的可信度经常受到轻微敌对扰动的挑战，这不仅会破坏预测准确性（鲁棒性）而且可能为类似的输入导致有偏预测（个体公平性）。最近提出了准确公正度来强制实施准确性和个体公平之间的谐和平衡。它引入了公平混淆矩阵的概念来将预测分类为真正公平、真正有偏、假正公平和假有偏。本文提出了一种谐波评估方法RobustFair，使用通过公平混淆定向梯度搜索制作的敌对扰动，对DNN的准确公正性进行评估。通过使用Taylor展开来近似敌对实例的基本真实性，RobustFair可以特别识别与虚假公平纠缠在一起的鲁棒性缺陷，这通常在鲁棒性评估中难以捉摸，在个体公平评估中缺失。RobustFair可以提高鲁棒性和个体公平性。",
