EAMDrift is designed to automatically adapt to out-of-distribution patterns in data and identify the most appropriate models to use at each moment through interpretable mechanisms, which include an automatic retraining process. Specifically, we encode different concepts with different models, each functioning as an observer of specific behaviors.

    "translated_abstract": "随着时间序列数据的可用性和机器学习算法的不断发展，在各个行业中使用机器学习进行时间序列预测变得越来越流行。然而，传统的时间序列预测方法依赖于预先优化的模型，难以处理数据中的不可预测模式。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法——EAMDrift，该方法通过按性能度量加权每个预测，将多个独立预测器的预测组合起来。 EAMDrift旨在通过解释性机制自动适应数据中的分布外模式并识别每个时刻使用的最合适的模型，其中包括自动重训练过程。具体而言，我们使用不同的模型对不同的概念进行编码，每个模型作为特定行为的观察者。然后，整体模型的激活将确定哪个概念观察者子集正在识别概念。",
