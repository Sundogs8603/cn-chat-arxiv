    "translated_abstract": "监测患者的健康状况并提前预测死亡率对及时提供患者护理和治疗至关重要。电子病历中的大量医学体征被用于先进的机器学习模型来进行预测。然而，原始临床体征的数据质量问题在文献中被较少讨论。通过对各种医学体征和大量患者住院记录中的缺失率和相关分数进行深入测量，我们发现综合缺失率非常高，大量无用的体征可能会损害预测模型的性能。我们得出结论，只有改善数据质量才能提高不同预测算法的基线准确性。我们设计了MedLens，通过统计自动选择重要医学体征，并使用灵活的插值方法处理高缺失率时间序列。",
    "tldr": "本文介绍了一个自动选择医学体征和回归插值的方法（MedLens），用于解决电子病历中医学体征数据缺失率过高导致预测性能降低的问题。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents an approach called MedLens, which automatically selects important medical signs and uses flexible interpolation to handle high missing rate time series data in electronic health records. The approach addresses the issue of reduced predictive performance due to high missing rates in medical sign data."
