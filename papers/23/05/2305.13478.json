    "translated_abstract": "近年来，自动可读性评估（ARA）的主要研究重点已转向使用昂贵的基于深度学习的方法，其主要目标是提高模型的准确性。然而，在低资源语言中，传统的手工制作特征仍然广泛使用，因为缺乏现有的NLP工具来提取更深层次的语言表示。我们从技术组件上退一步，着重探讨如何通过诸如相互智能性或语言相关性的语言方面来提高低资源环境下的ARA。我们收集在菲律宾的三种语言（他加禄语，比科尔语和宿务语）中编写的短篇小说来训练可读性评估模型，并探索各种跨语言设置中的数据和特征之间的交互作用。 我们的结果表明，在具有高相互可理解性的语言中应用n-gram重叠的新型专业特征CrossNGO可以改善ARA。",
