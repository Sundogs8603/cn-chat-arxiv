    "abstract": "Numerical evaluations of the memory capacity (MC) of recurrent neural networks reported in the literature often contradict well-established theoretical bounds. In this paper, we study the case of linear echo state networks, for which the total memory capacity has been proven to be equal to the rank of the corresponding Kalman controllability matrix. We shed light on various reasons for the inaccurate numerical estimations of the memory, and we show that these issues, often overlooked in the recent literature, are of an exclusively numerical nature. More explicitly, we prove that when the Krylov structure of the linear MC is ignored, a gap between the theoretical MC and its empirical counterpart is introduced. As a solution, we develop robust numerical approaches by exploiting a result of MC neutrality with respect to the input mask matrix. Simulations show that the memory curves that are recovered using the proposed methods fully agree with the theory.",

    "translated_abstract": "文献中对于循环神经网络的记忆容量（MC）的数值评估常常与已经建立的理论界限相矛盾。本文研究了线性回声状态网络的情况，对应的Kalman可控矩阵的秩已被证明等于总记忆容量。我们揭示了关于记忆不准确的数值评估的各种原因，并表明这些问题是纯粹数值方面上的，往往在近期文献中被忽视。更明确地说，我们证明了当线性MC的Krylov结构被忽略时，理论MC和它的经验值之间会存在差距。解决这一问题的方法是，利用MC相对于输入掩码矩阵的中立性，开发出稳健的数值方法。模拟结果显示，我们提出的方法得到的记忆曲线与理论完全一致。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了线性回声状态网络的记忆容量计算问题。通过发现数值评估的不准确性主要源于数值方面的问题，提出了基于掩码矩阵MC相对于中立性的稳健数值方法，该方法可以解决数值评估中的误差问题。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper addresses the issue of calculating the memory capacity of linear echo state networks. By discovering that inaccurate numerical evaluations stem mainly from numerical issues, the paper proposes robust numerical methods based on the neutrality of MC relative to the input mask matrix, which can address the problem of errors in numerical evaluations."
