    "translated_abstract": "在人道主义危机期间，准确和快速的情况分析对于高效地提供人道主义援助至关重要，并且是人道主义原则和不留任何人落后原则的基础。语言处理系统可以极大地受益于这种数据分析，例如，按照人道主义本体对文本数据进行分类。然而，仅仅通过微调通用的大型语言模型 (LLM) 来实现，涉及一些实践和道德问题，特别是在数据稀疏和复杂子领域上的效果不佳以及社会偏见和不良关联的编码。在这项工作中，我们旨在为人道主义数据分析提供一种有效和道德意识的系统。我们通过 (1) 引入一个适合人道主义分析框架的新架构，(2) 创建和发布一个新的人道主义特定 LLM，称为 HumBert，并且 (3) 提出了一种系统的方式来衡量和减少偏见。",
