    "translated_abstract": "访问个人健康数据对于获得新的见解和推动科学进步至关重要。特别是，基于人工智能的现代方法依赖于大型数据集的可用性和可访问性。在健康领域中，由于隐私问题，访问个人级别的数据常常具有挑战性。一种有希望的替代方案是生成完全综合数据，即通过随机过程生成具有与原始数据相似统计特性的数据，但它们与原始个人级别记录没有一对一的对应关系。在本研究中，我们使用了一种最先进的合成数据生成方法，并对在营养领域中特定用例的生成数据进行深入的质量分析。我们展示了对合成数据进行细致分析的必要性，这超出了描绘性统计，并提供了有价值的见解，介绍如何实现综合数据集的全部潜力。通过方法的扩展和保护机密性，合成数据可以成为可重复研究的有力工具。",
