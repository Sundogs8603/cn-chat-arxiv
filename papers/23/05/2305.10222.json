To investigate the robustness of HAR systems, we analyzed several suitable current public datasets and selected WISDM for our investigation of Deep Learning approaches.

    "translated_abstract": "人类活动识别已成为近年来科学研究的亮点，因为它在医疗保健、竞技比赛、智慧城市和智能家居等各个领域都有应用。虽然研究人员专注于处理数据的方法，但用户仍在疑惑用于活动识别的人工智能方法是否可信。信任主要取决于系统的可靠性或鲁棒性。为了调查HAR系统的鲁棒性，我们分析了几个合适的当前公共数据集，并选择WISDM进行我们对深度学习方法的研究。虽然WISDM发布的规格符合我们的基本要求（如大型、平衡、可多硬件操作），但在分析过程中发现了一些隐藏问题。这些问题降低了分类器的性能和整体信任度。通过识别问题并修复数据集，分类器的性能得到了提高。本文介绍了我们用于修复数据集的方法。",
