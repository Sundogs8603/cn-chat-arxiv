    "abstract": "The recent improvement in code generation capabilities due to the use of large language models has mainly benefited general purpose programming languages. Domain specific languages, such as the ones used for IT Automation, have received far less attention, despite involving many active developers and being an essential component of modern cloud platforms. This work focuses on the generation of Ansible-YAML, a widely used markup language for IT Automation. We present Ansible Wisdom, a natural-language to Ansible-YAML code generation tool, aimed at improving IT automation productivity. Ansible Wisdom is a transformer-based model, extended by training with a new dataset containing Ansible-YAML. We also develop two novel performance metrics for YAML and Ansible to capture the specific characteristics of this domain. Results show that Ansible Wisdom can accurately generate Ansible script from natural language prompts with performance comparable or better than existing state of the art code ",

    "translated_abstract": "由于大语言模型在代码生成方面的不断提升，在通用编程语言方面的受益最大，而针对IT自动化等领域特定语言的研究较少。本研究聚焦于Ansible-YAML的生成，提出了一种名为Ansible Wisdom的自然语言转Ansible-YAML代码的工具，旨在提高IT自动化生产力。研究采用基于Transformer的模型，并通过新的包含Ansible-YAML的数据集进行扩展训练。同时，还开发了两个用于捕捉此领域特征的YAML和Ansible性能指标。结果表明，Ansible Wisdom可以精确地从自然语言提示中生成Ansible脚本，并且其性能可与现有技术的状态相媲美或更好。",
