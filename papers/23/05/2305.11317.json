Despite the advancements of T2I models, a common issue encountered by users is the need for repetitive editing of input prompts in order to receive a satisfactory image, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Given the demonstrated text generation power of large-scale language models, such as GPT-k, we investigate the potential of utilizing such models to improve the prompt editing process for T2I generation. We conduct a series of experiments to compare the common edits made by humans and GPT-k, evaluate the performance of GPT-k in prompting T2I, and examine factors that may influence this process. We found that GPT-k models focus more on inserting modifiers while humans tend to replace words and phrases, which includes changes to the subject matter.

    "translated_abstract": "文本到图像（T2I）生成领域在研究界和用户中引起了极大关注。虽然T2I模型已经取得了很大进展，但用户常遇到的一个问题是需要重复编辑输入提示才能获得令人满意的图像，这是耗时且劳动强度大的。针对大规模语言模型（例如GPT-k）的文本生成能力，我们研究了利用这些模型来改进T2I生成中提示编辑过程的潜力。我们进行了一系列实验，比较了人类和GPT-k常见的编辑方式，评估GPT-k在推动T2I方面的性能，并检查可能影响此过程的因素。我们发现，GPT-k模型更注重插入修改器，而人类倾向于替换单词和短语，包括对主题的更改。实验结果显示，GPT-k在调整修改器方面比较有效。",
