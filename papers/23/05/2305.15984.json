    "translated_abstract": "已有的异质治疗效应学习者缺乏端到端治疗信息共享的通用机制，必须将数据分割到潜在结果函数中训练CATE学习器，这可能导致具有有限观测数据的有偏估计。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于深度学习的框架，用于训练CATE学习器，促进治疗组之间的动态端到端信息共享。该框架基于“超网络”的“软权重共享”，具有参数效率、更快训练和改进结果等优点。所提出的框架补充了现有的CATE学习器，并引入了一类我们称之为“HyperCATE”的新型不确定性感知CATE学习器。我们开发了常用CATE学习器的HyperCATE版本，并在IHDP、ACIC-2016和Twins基准测试中进行了评估。",
