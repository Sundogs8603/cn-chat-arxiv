    "translated_abstract": "连续时间模型（例如神经ODE和神经流量）在分析电子病历中常见的不规则采样时间序列方面显示出有希望的结果。 基于这些模型，时间序列通常在变分自动编码器架构中通过初值问题（IVP）求解器和递归神经网络的混合处理。 顺序求解IVP使得这样的模型在计算效率上不够高。 本文提出了一种纯粹使用连续过程对时间序列进行建模的方法，其状态演变可以通过IVP直接近似。 这消除了递归计算的需要，并允许多个状态并行演变。 我们进一步通过一种基于其可逆性的IVP求解器融合编码器和解码器，这导致参数更少，收敛更快。 在三个真实世界的数据集上进行的实验表明，所提出的方法在获得更快的训练速度的同时，仍然可以获得较高的分类性能和预测性能。",
