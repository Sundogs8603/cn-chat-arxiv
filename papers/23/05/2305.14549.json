    "translated_abstract": "当客户在寻找其高级购物兴趣（如徒步旅行等）的产品时，推荐多样化的产品类型（PTs）对于提供良好的购物体验至关重要。然而，电子商务产品目录中通常缺乏SI-PT的连接，并且由于潜在的SI数量巨大，手动构建这种连接也是非常昂贵的，这使得我们无法建立易于访问的知识系统。为了建立这样的连接，我们提出从包含手工PT推荐的Web页面中提取PTs的方法。将提取任务设置为二进制HTML节点分类，因为我们的目标Web页面中的HTML节点可以呈现一个且仅一个PT短语的普遍观察。为此，我们引入了TrENC，即Tree-Transformer编码器用于节点分类。它改进了内部节点之间的依赖建模，并保留了长期的兄弟姐妹和祖先-后代关系的注意机制。",
