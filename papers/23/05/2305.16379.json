    "translated_abstract": "数据增强（DA）是增强视觉强化学习（RL）算法的样本效率的关键技术。值得注意的是，仅使用简单的观察变换就可以在不进行额外辅助表示任务或预训练编码器的情况下获得出色的性能。然而，仍然不清楚DA的哪些属性是实现样本效率视觉RL的有效性的原因。为了调查这个问题并进一步探索DA的潜力，本文进行了全面的实验，评估了DA属性对其有效性的影响，并提供以下见解和改进：（1）对于单个DA操作，我们揭示了充足的空间多样性和轻微的困难度都是不可缺少的。基于这一发现，我们引入了一种新的DA操作——随机PadResize（Rand PR），它提供了丰富的空间多样性和最小的困难度。（2）对于多类型的DA融合方案，增加的DA困难度和不稳定的数据分布",
