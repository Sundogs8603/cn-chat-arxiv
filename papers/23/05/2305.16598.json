Existing methods for norm recognition tend to focus only on surface-level features of dialogues and do not take into account the interactions within a conversation. To address this issue, we propose NormMark, a probabilistic generative Markov model to carry the latent features throughout a dialogue. These features are captured by discrete and continuous latent variables conditioned on the conversation history, and improve the model's ability in norm recognition. The model is trainable on weakly annotated data using the variational technique. On a dataset with limited norm annotations, we show that our approach achieves higher F1 score, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods, including GPT3.",

    "translated_abstract": "社会文化规范是一种被广泛接受的行为指导。将社会文化规范纳入对话模型中可以生成适合社会文化背景的话语。现有的规范识别方法往往只关注对话的表层特征，而没有考虑对话之间的交互。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了NormMark，一种概率生成的马尔可夫模型，以贯穿整个对话的隐含特征为特点。这些特征是由离散和连续的潜在变量在对话历史的条件下捕获的，提高了模型在规范识别方面的能力。该模型可使用变分技术对弱标注数据进行训练。在具有有限规范注释的数据集上，我们展示了我们的方法实现了更高的F1得分，超越了当前最先进的方法，包括GPT-3。",
