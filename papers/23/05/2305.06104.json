    "translated_abstract": "N-元事实由主要三元组（头实体、关系、尾实体）和任意数量的辅助属性值对组成，这在现实世界的知识图谱中很常见。对于N-元事实的链接预测是预测其中一个元素的缺失，填补缺失元素有助于丰富知识图谱并促进许多下游应用程序。以往的研究通常需要大量高质量的数据来理解N-元事实中的元素，但这些研究忽视了少样本关系，在现实世界的场景中却很常见。因此，本文引入一个新任务——少样本N-元事实链接预测，旨在使用有限的标记实例来预测N-元事实中的缺失实体。我们也提出了一个针对N-元事实的少样本链接预测模型FLEN，它由三个模块组成：关系学习模块、支持特定调整模块和查询推理模块。",
