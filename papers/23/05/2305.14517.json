    "translated_abstract": "药物协同是指多种药物联合作用所产生的合成效应，对于优化治疗结果非常关键。然而，可能的药物组合数量巨大，计算成本高，导致药物协同数据有限，需要预测方法。在本文中，我们引入了一种新颖的条件图融合层——CongFu，用于预测药物协同作用。CongFu采用注意机制和瓶颈技术来提取本地图上下文并在全局上下文中有条件地融合图数据。其模块化架构使得可以更换图层模块，包括读出和图编码器，以适应不同的应用场景。为了评估CongFu的性能，我们对四个数据集进行了全面的实验，涵盖了三种不同的药物协同预测设置。值得注意的是，CongFu在12个基准数据集中的11个上取得了最先进的结果，证明了其能力。",
