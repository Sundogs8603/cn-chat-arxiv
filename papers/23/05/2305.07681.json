    "translated_abstract": "随着人口结构变化所带来的技能短缺问题不断恶化，组织机构如何保留即将退休专家的知识并传授给新手已成为一个关键性挑战。传统上这种知识传播是通过个人互动来完成的，但这种方式缺少可伸缩性且需要大量的资源与时间。基于信息技术的教学系统解决了可伸缩性问题，但它们的开发仍然耗费时间且繁琐。在本文中，我们研究了机器学习模型在组织背景下促进知识传播的潜力，从而实现更具成本效益的基于信息技术的教学系统。通过系统的文献综述，我们考察了核心概念、主题和维度，以更好地理解和设计基于机器学习的教学系统。为此，我们总结了机器学习模型在基于信息技术的教学系统中的应用，归纳地分析了相关领域的概念。",
