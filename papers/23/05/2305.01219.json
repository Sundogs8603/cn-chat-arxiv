    "translated_abstract": "基于提示的学习范例弥合了预训练和微调之间的差距，在几个NLP任务中取得了最先进的性能，尤其是在少样本情况下。尽管应用广泛，但基于提示的学习容易受到后门攻击。文本后门攻击旨在通过注入触发器并修改标签来在模型中引入有针对性的漏洞。然而，由于触发器的存在和毒瘤数据标注不正确等缺陷，这种攻击存在异常的自然语言表达。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖有效的“ProAttack”方法，基于提示来执行干净标签的后门攻击，使用的是提示本身作为触发器。我们的方法不需要外部触发器，并确保毒瘤数据的标注正确，提高了后门攻击的隐蔽性。通过在丰富的资源和少样本文本语料库上的广泛实验，我们证明了ProAttack方法在保持干净数据一致性的同时显著优于现有的后门攻击方式。",
