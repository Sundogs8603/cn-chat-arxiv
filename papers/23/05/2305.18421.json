    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种名为“HyperTime”的超参数优化方法，旨在寻找对未知测试数据的潜在时间分布偏移具有鲁棒性的超参数。我们的工作得到了一个重要观察的启发，即通过超参数优化，在许多情况下可以实现时间上的鲁棒预测性能。基于这一观察，我们借鉴了鲁棒优化文献中的最坏情况导向哲学，帮助找到这样的鲁棒性超参数配置。HyperTime在历史验证数据集上对平均验证损失和最坏情况验证损失设置了词典优先级顺序。我们对预期测试损失的上限进行了理论分析，揭示了我们的方法的独特优势。我们还在多个具有时间分布偏移的机器学习任务上展示了所提出方法的强大实证表现。",
