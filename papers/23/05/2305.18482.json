    "translated_abstract": "时尚是世界上最大的行业之一，计算机视觉技术近年来变得越来越流行，特别是对于物体检测和服装分割等任务。尽管计算机视觉解决方案在时尚行业中快速增长，但许多问题还远未得到解决。因此，使用开箱即用的预训练计算机视觉模型不一定能提供期望的解决方案。本文提出了一种流程，它可以接受含噪音的带有人物的图像，并特别检测属于上装或下装的服装区域。我们的解决方案实现了可以在图像中找到人体部位的模型，例如全身对半身，或者根本没有找到人体。然后，其他模型通过知道有人和其组成（例如，我们并不总是有一个完整的人体）来找到图像的边界框/区域，这些框很可能对应于下装或上装。对于边界框/区域的创建，我们评估了基于锚点和无锚点的物体检测算法，并选择了最佳性能的算法。我们在Polyvore数据集上进行了实验，并将结果与最先进的方法进行了比较，结果表明，所提出的方法在准确性和速度方面优于它们。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a pipeline for fashion object detection that can automatically distinguish between tops and bottoms in an image with a person. The solution implements models capable of finding human body parts and selects the best performing anchor-based and anchor-free object detection algorithms. Experiments on the Polyvore dataset show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed and accuracy."
