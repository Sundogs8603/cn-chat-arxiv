    "translated_abstract": "安全性一直是应用于实际场景的基于学习的方法部署的关键问题。为了解决这个问题，控制屏障函数(CBF)及其变体已受到广泛关注，用于关键安全控制。然而，由于CBF的短视单步性质以及缺乏设计类-$\\mathcal{K}$函数的原则方法，目前的CBF仍存在基本局限性：最优性、稳定性和可行性。本文提出了一种新的和统一的方法来解决这些限制，即自适应多步控制屏障函数(AM-CBF)，其中我们将类-$\\mathcal{K}$函数通过神经网络进行参数化，并与强化学习策略一起训练。此外，为了减轻短视性，我们提出一种新的“多步训练和单步执行”范式，使CBF具有远见性，而执行仍然解决单步凸二次规划问题。我们的方法进行了评估。",
