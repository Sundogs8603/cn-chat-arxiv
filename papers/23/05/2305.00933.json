    "translated_abstract": "疾病传播的短期预测是风险评估和公共卫生决策中至关重要的组成部分。虽然已经开发了不同的短期预测模型，但其相对性能仍有疑问。本文比较基于更新方程的流行病学机械模型和时间序列统计模型的短期概率预测。我们的经验比较基于美国六个大州在第一年的COVID-19每日发病率数据。我们发现，平均而言，来自统计时间序列模型的概率预测总体上至少与机械模型的预测一样准确。此外，统计时间序列模型更好地捕捉波动性。我们的发现表明，通过对疾病动态做出假设将领域知识整合到机械模型中并不能改善疾病发生率的短期预测。但是，我们指出，预测精度在不同州和时间段中有所变化，表明可能存在机械模型的表现优于统计模型的情况。",
