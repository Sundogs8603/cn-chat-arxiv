    "translated_abstract": "所谓的黑盒深度学习模型在许多科学领域中，包括无线通信领域，被越来越多地用于分类任务。在这一趋势中，监督式深度学习模型似乎是领域相关分类问题最常见的解决方案。虽然它们被证明具有无与伦比的性能，但需要大量标记的训练数据和不可解释的推理作为两个主要缺点，限制了它们的使用。自监督架构出现作为一个减少所需标记数据规模的有前途的解决方案，但解释性问题仍然存在。在本文中，我们提出了一种解释深度聚类的方法，自监督学习架构由基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的表示学习部分和聚类部分组成。对于最先进的表示学习部分，我们的方法采用了引导反向传播来解释相交区域的含义。",
