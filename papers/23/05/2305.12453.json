    "translated_abstract": "基于假设的论证（ABA）是一个广为人知的结构化论证形式，其中论证和它们之间的攻击是基于规则、可废弃的假设及其相反的观点。对ABA框架（ABAFs）施加的一个常见限制是它们是平坦的，即每个可废弃的假设只能被假设，而不能被推导出来。尽管已知平坦的ABAFs可以被转化为Dung提出的抽象论证框架（AFs），但不存在从一般的、可能非平坦的ABAFs到任何类型的抽象论证形式的转换。在本文中，我们填补了这个空白，并展示了双极AFs（BAFs）可以实例化一般的ABAFs。为此，我们开发了合适的、新颖的BAF语义，借鉴了推导支持的概念。我们研究了我们的BAFs的基本属性，包括计算复杂性，并在几种语义下证明了与ABAFs的期望关系。最后，为了支持计算和可解释性，我们提出了一种模型转换方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper addresses the limitation of assumption-based argumentation (ABA) that only allows assumptions but not derivations, and proposes a novel bipolar argumentation framework (BAFs) that is capable of instantiating general ABA frameworks. The paper also proves the relationship between BAFs and ABAFs under different semantics."
