    "abstract": "We investigate the emergent abilities of the recently proposed web-scale speech model Whisper, by adapting it to unseen tasks with prompt engineering. We selected three tasks: audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR), code-switched speech recognition (CS-ASR), and speech translation (ST) on unseen language pairs. We design task-specific prompts, by either leveraging another large-scale model, or simply manipulating the special tokens in the default prompts. Experiments show that compared to the default prompts, our proposed prompts improve performance by 10% to 45% on the three zero-shot tasks, and even outperform SotA supervised models on some datasets. In addition, our experiments reveal many interesting properties of Whisper, including its robustness to prompts, bias on accents, and the multilingual understanding in its latent space.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了最近提出的Web规模语音模型Whisper的新兴功能，在使用提示工程技术调整模型后，适应了未见过的AVSR，CS-ASR和ST三个任务。我们设计了特定于任务的提示，要么利用另一个大规模模型，要么简单地操作默认提示中的特殊标记。实验证明，与默认提示相比，我们提出的提示使这三个零-shot任务的性能提高了10%到45％，甚至在一些数据集上超过了SotA监督模型。此外，我们的实验揭示了Whisper的许多有趣属性，包括其提示的鲁棒性，对口音的偏好以及潜在空间中的多语言理解。代码可在https://github.com/jasonppy/PromptingWhisper上找到。",
