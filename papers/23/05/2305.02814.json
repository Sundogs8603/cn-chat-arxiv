    "translated_abstract": "多模态情感识别可以从各种数据模态(如视频、文本和音频)中识别人类的情感。然而，我们发现这项任务很容易受到不包含有用语义的噪声信息的影响。为此，我们提出了一种新的范例，试图在其流程中提取噪声抑制特征并引入噪声感知学习方案，以有效提高多模态情感理解的鲁棒性。我们的新流程，即噪声抑制的多模态变压器(NORM-TR)，主要介绍了一个噪声抑制通用特征(NRGF)提取器和用于多模态情感识别任务的变压器。尤其是，我们使NRGF提取器学习通用和不受扰动的表示形式，以便获得一致且有意义的语义。此外，我们应用变压器来结合多模态输入的多模态特征(MFs)，基于它们与NRGF之间的关系。因此，可能的不敏感部分可以自然地被抑制，进而提高模型在嘈杂数据上的性能。我们的实验表明，所提出的NORM-TR在各种实际的多模态情感识别基准上都具有优越的性能，表明我们的噪声抑制方法的有效性。",

It utilizes a Noise-Resistant Generic Feature (NRGF) extractor and a Transformer to obtain noise-resistant features and incorporate Multimodal Features (MFs). The proposed NORM-TR achieves superior performances over state-of-the-art methods on various in-the-wild multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks, indicating the effectiveness of our noise-resistant approach."
