    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于在认知无线电网络中的应用，多人赌博问题得到了广泛研究。虽然文献大多考虑同步玩家，但无线电网络（例如物联网） tend to have asynchronous devices。这引发了更加困难的异步多人赌博问题，首先用探索然后承诺（ETC）算法解决（请参见 Dakdouk，2022），遗憾上限为 $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$。甚至在考虑分散化之前，理解集中式情况仍然是一个挑战，因为不知道是否可能得到小于 $\\Omega(T^\\frac{2}{3})$ 的遗憾。 我们对这个问题作出了肯定回答，因为UCB的自然扩展展现出了 $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T\\log(T)})$ 极小化遗憾。更重要的是，我们介绍了一个叫做“谨慎贪婪”的集中式算法，如果最优策略至少将一个玩家指定在每个武器上（被证明会出现这种情况），则可以产生常数保证的遗憾。",
