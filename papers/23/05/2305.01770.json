    "translated_abstract": "呼吸道合胞病毒（RSV）是婴幼儿最危险的呼吸系统疾病之一。由于COVID-19的非药物干预（NPI）措施，RSV的季节性传播模式在2020年已经中断，并在2021年北半球提前数月出现转变。因此，理解COVID-19如何影响RSV并构建预测算法以预测COVID-19后RSV再出现的时间和强度至关重要。本文提出了一种名为DeCom的深度耦合张量分解机，用于COVID-19后RSV预测。DeCom利用张量分解和残差建模，能可靠地学习受COVID-19影响下的RSV传播，同时考虑正常季节性RSV传播模式和NPI。在真实的RSV数据集上的实验结果显示，DeCom比现有RSV预测算法更准确，并可最大程度地提高预测效果。",
