    "translated_abstract": "脉冲神经网络（SNNs）由于其能源效率和生物可行性而受到了近来的关注。然而，SNNs 的性能仍然落后于传统的人工神经网络（ANNs），因为目前还没有关于SNNs 的最佳学习算法的共识。目前表现最好的SNNs 是基于ANNs 转化或使用基于脉冲的反向传播学习。最近的研究重点是开发和测试不同的学习策略，并进行手工架构和参数调整。神经进化（NE）已被证明是一种自动设计ANNs 和调整参数的有效方式，但其在SNNs 中的应用仍处于早期阶段。DENSER 是一种基于遗传算法（GA）和结构语法进化（SGE）原则的自动设计ANNs 和参数化的NE框架。本文提出了SPENSER，一种基于DENSER 的SNNs 生成NE框架，用于图像分类。",
