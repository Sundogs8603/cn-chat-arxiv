    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在制造过程中模拟参数效应越来越受到关注。但是，这种方法仅适用于已建立深度物理模型的过程，因为现有方法侧重于减少生成训练数据的实验和/或计算成本，而忽略了开发新过程的定性准确物理模型所具有的内在和显著代价。本文提出了一种基于迁移学习的方法来解决这个问题，其中一个机器学习模型在来自物理过程模型（源）的大量计算成本低的数据上进行训练，然后在少量高成本实验数据（目标）上进行微调。我们的方法的新颖之处在于将源模型的定性精度界限推向文献中认为高的水平，并且它是高模型开发成本的根源。我们通过预测制造过程中受机械振动和温度变化影响的添加制造（AM）钛制零件的质量来评估我们的方法。实验结果表明，我们的方法在准确性方面优于现有最先进方法，并显著减少了模型开发所需的实验数据量。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an accelerated and inexpensive machine learning approach based on transfer learning, which aims to improve the accuracy of quality prediction for additively manufactured titanium parts under mechanical vibration and temperature variations, while significantly reducing the amount of experimental data required for model development. The approach trains a machine learning model on computationally inexpensive data from a physics-based process model and fine-tunes it on costly experimental data."
