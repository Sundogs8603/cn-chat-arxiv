    "translated_abstract": "当机器学习模型在一系列任务上持续训练时，它们容易忘记先前任务上学习到的知识，这种现象称为灾难性遗忘。现有的解决灾难性遗忘的方法往往涉及存储过去任务的信息，这意味着内存使用是确定实用性的主要因素。本文提出了一种内存高效的解决灾难性遗忘的方法，改进了一种已有的算法——正交梯度下降（OGD）。OGD利用先前模型梯度来找到维持先前数据点性能的权重更新。然而，由于存储先前模型梯度的内存成本随算法运行时间增长而增加，因此OGD不适用于任意长时间跨度的连续学习。针对这个问题，本文提出了SketchOGD。SketchOGD采用在线草图算法，将模型梯度压缩为固定大小的矩阵。",
