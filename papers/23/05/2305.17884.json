Our approach offers a comprehensive solution methodology, wherein we employ a combination of particle simulations to update the solution and re-estimations of the new solution as a tensor-network using a recently proposed tensor train sketching technique. Our method can also be interpreted as an alternative approach for performing particle number control by assuming the particles originate from an underlying tensor network.
