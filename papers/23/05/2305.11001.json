    "translated_abstract": "文献中广泛讨论了宏观经济变量对动态期限结构模型的重要性。到目前为止，以往的研究仅考虑了DTSM中经济和利率实际动态之间的线性相互作用。我们提出了一种广义建模方法，利用高斯DTSM，允许两者之间的非线性关联。我们利用这种建模方式进行预测，并构建自定义的顺序蒙特卡洛估计和预测方案，引入高斯过程先验来建模非线性关联。建议的顺序方案也可用于动态投资组合优化，以评估为投资者创造的经济价值潜力。我们使用美国国债数据和选定的宏观经济指标，特别是核心通胀和真实经济活动来展示这种方法。我们将非线性模型的结果与仅考虑线性相互作用的模型的结果进行对比。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes a generalized modeling method, which introduces Gaussian process priors to model nonlinear associations in Dynamic Term Structure Models (DTSMs) for forecasting and dynamic portfolio optimization. Compared to previous studies that only considered linear interactions, the proposed approach reflects more realistic economic relationships. Results are demonstrated using US Treasury data and selected macroeconomic indices."
