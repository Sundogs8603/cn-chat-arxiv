While earlier works were limited to dialogues about specific objects or scenes within images, recent works have incorporated images into open-domain dialogues. However, their response generators are unimodal, accepting text input but no image input, thus prone to generating responses contradictory to the images shared in the dialogue. Therefore, this work proposes a complete chatbot system using two multimodal deep learning models: an image retriever that understands texts and a response generator that understands images. The image retriever, implemented by ViT and BERT, selects the most relevant image given the dialogue history and a database of images. The response generator, implemented by ViT and GPT-2/DialoGPT, generates an appropriate response given the dialogue history and the most recently retrieved image.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在创建一个多模态AI系统，与人类进行聊天并分享相关照片。早期的工作仅限于关于图像中特定对象或场景的对话，而最近的工作已将图像纳入开放域对话中。然而，它们的响应生成器是单模态的，仅接受文本输入而不接受图像输入，因此容易生成与对话中分享的图像相矛盾的响应。因此，本研究提出了一个完整的聊天机器人系统，使用两个多模态深度学习模型：一个理解文本的图像检索器和一个理解图像的响应生成器。 图像检索器由ViT和BERT实现，根据对话历史记录和图像数据库选择最相关的图像。 响应生成器由ViT和GPT-2/DialoGPT实现，生成根据对话历史和最近检索的图像合适的响应。这两个模型在带有成对图像的开放域对话数据集PhotoChat上进行了培训和评估。结果表明，所提出的多模态系统优于仅文本和单模态系统，达到了更高的图像基础准确性和更好的对话连贯性。",
