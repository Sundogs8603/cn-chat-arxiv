    "translated_abstract": "量化预测不确定性是现代数值天气预报和数据同化系统中的关键。基于集合的数据同化系统采用多个模型集成来包含状态依赖的不确定性量化,但这种方法在计算和开发方面具有挑战性。本文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络的机器学习方法，使用单个动力学模型集成估计表示预测误差协方差矩阵的状态依赖预测不确定性。这是通过利用损失函数实现的，该函数考虑了预测误差的异方差性。该方法的性能在混合数据同化方法中进行了研究，该方法结合了Kalman样式分析更新和基于机器学习的状态依赖预测误差协方差矩阵的估计。使用Lorensso等（2006）模型进行了观测系统模拟实验，结果表明，与常用的基于集合的方法相比，机器学习方法在准确性和计算成本方面表现更好。",
