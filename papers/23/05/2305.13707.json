    "translated_abstract": "语言模型从研究原型逐渐商业化，被作为Web API提供，最近的研究强调了这些产品的多语言能力。API供应商根据使用量收费，具体而言是由潜在的语言模型处理或生成的“令牌”数量。然而，什么构成一个令牌，是与训练数据和模型相关的，在不同语言中传达相同信息所需的令牌数量差异很大。在这项工作中，我们分析了这种不均匀性对 API 跨语言定价公平性的影响。我们对 22 种语言进行了系统分析，评估OpenAI的语言模型API在多语言基准测试中的成本和效用。我们提供了证据表明，许多支持语言的使用者付费过高，并获得更差的结果。这些使用者往往来自 API 使用率较低的地区。",
