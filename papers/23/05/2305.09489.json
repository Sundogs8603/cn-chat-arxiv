    "abstract": "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have made great strides in generating high-quality samples in both discrete and continuous domains. However, Discrete DDPMs (D3PMs) have yet to be applied to the domain of Symbolic Music. This work presents the direct generation of Polyphonic Symbolic Music using D3PMs. Our model exhibits state-of-the-art sample quality, according to current quantitative evaluation metrics, and allows for flexible infilling at the note level. We further show, that our models are accessible to post-hoc classifier guidance, widening the scope of possible applications. However, we also cast a critical view on quantitative evaluation of music sample quality via statistical metrics, and present a simple algorithm that can confound our metrics with completely spurious, non-musical samples.",

    "translated_abstract": "在连续和离散领域中，去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）在生成高质量样本方面取得了重大进展。然而，离散DDPM（D3PM）尚未应用于符号音乐领域。本研究提出了使用D3PM直接生成复调符号音乐。根据当前的定量评估指标，我们的模型展示出了最先进的样本质量，并允许在音符级别上进行灵活的插值。我们进一步展示了我们的模型对后期分类器指导的可访问性，扩大了可能应用的范围。然而，我们也对通过统计指标对音乐样本质量进行定量评估持有批判的观点，并呈现了一个简单的算法，可以干扰我们的指标，生成完全虚假的非音乐样本。",
