    "translated_title": "反馈循环分类及其与自动化决策系统中偏见的关系",
    "translated_abstract": "基于预测的决策系统在各个领域中变得越来越普遍。先前的研究已经证明，这类系统容易受到失控的反馈循环的影响，例如警察不考虑实际犯罪率，一再地前往同一个社区，这加剧了现有的偏见。在实践中，自动化决策对系统本身产生了动态反馈效应，这可能会持续很长时间，使得短视的设计选择难以控制系统的演变。尽管研究人员开始提出长期解决方案以防止负面结果（如对某些群体的偏见），但这些干预大部分取决于临时建模假设，目前缺乏对基于机器学习的决策系统中反馈动态的严格理论理解。在本文中，我们使用动力系统理论的语言，这是应用数学的一个分支，用于分析自然和人工的系统和它们如何随时间变化。我们提出了一个基于时间依赖的分类系统，以便更好地了解自动化决策的反馈循环类别。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一个基于时间依赖的分类系统，用以帮助更好地了解自动化决策系统中的反馈循环，其中反馈循环可能会导致系统中的偏见得到加剧。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a time-dependent classification system to better understand feedback loops in automated decision-making systems, which can lead to exacerbation of biases within the system. The paper uses dynamical systems theory to analyze the feedback dynamics in ML-based decision-making systems."
