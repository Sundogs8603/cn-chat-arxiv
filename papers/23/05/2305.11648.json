    "translated_abstract": "多目标优化问题涉及在多个且常常是冲突的目标之间找到具有不同权衡的解决方案。 Ising 机是旨在找到 Ising 模型的绝对或近似基态的物理设备。为了将 Ising 机应用于多目标问题，使用加权求和目标函数将多目标转换为单目标问题。然而，导出均匀分布于 Pareto 前沿的标量化权重并不容易。先前的工作表明，基于双分割搜索的自适应权重和基于先前探索权重的平均值的权重可以比均匀生成的权重更快地探索 Pareto 前沿。然而，这些自适应方法过去只用于双目标问题。在这项工作中，我们以两种方式扩展了基于平均值的自适应方法：（i）我们扩展了用于解决具有两个或多个目标的标量化权重的自适应方法；（ii）我们考虑了两种定义收敛标准的方式来终止权重自适应。我们将我们的方法与均匀生成和基于双分割搜索的权重在两个和三个目标的 QUBO 问题上的性能进行了比较。我们的结果表明，基于平均值的自适应方法优于均匀生成和基于双分割搜索的权重。",
    "tldr": "本文基于 Ising 机，提出了一种自适应求解多目标 QUBOs 的方法，该方法比之前的方法探索 Pareto 前沿更快、更准确。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an adaptive method for solving multi-objective QUBOs based on Ising machines, which outperforms previous methods in exploring the Pareto front faster and more accurately. The method extends previous adaptive methods to handle problems with two or more objectives and considers two ways to define the convergence criteria for weight adaptation."
