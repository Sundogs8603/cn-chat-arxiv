    "translated_abstract": "为了减少对大量有监督分割注释集的依赖，已经提出了多种弱监督语义分割（WSSS）策略。这些策略通常依赖于先进的数据和模型正则化策略，以激发分割先验中有用属性（例如，预测完整性和对语义边界的忠实度）的发展，而不考虑注释信息的缺乏。在这项工作中，我们首先通过分析互补的WSSS技术和正则化策略，考虑它们的优点和局限性，建立了一个强大的基准。然后，我们提出了一种新的类别特定的对抗性擦除策略，包括逐渐改进的两个对抗性CAM生成网络，以产生稳健的语义分割提议。实证结果表明，我们的方法显著提高了基准的效果，在Pascal VOC 2012和MS COCO 2014数据集上都取得了显著的改进。",
