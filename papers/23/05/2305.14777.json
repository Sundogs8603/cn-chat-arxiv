    "translated_abstract": "最优输运（OT）问题研究一种运输映射，能够在最小化给定成本函数的同时连接两个分布。在这方面，OT已被用于生成建模任务中的可追溯的先验分布和数据之间。然而，基于OT的方法容易受到离群点的影响，并在训练期间面临优化挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于非平衡最优输运（UOT）半对偶公式的新型生成模型。与OT不同，UOT消除了分布匹配的硬性约束，提供了更好的对抗离群点的鲁棒性，训练期间的稳定性以及更快的收敛速度。我们通过实验验证了这些属性。此外，我们还研究了UOT之间分布差异的理论上限。我们的模型优于现有的基于OT的生成模型，在CIFAR-10和CelebA-HQ-256上实现了分别为2.97和5.80的FID分数。",
