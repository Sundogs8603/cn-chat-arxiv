For years now, state-of-the-art systems have reported high, but also highly variable, performance across data sets and languages. We investigate the causes of this high performance and high variability; we find several aspects of data set creation and evaluation which systematically inflate performance and obfuscate differences between languages. To improve generalizability and reliability of results, we propose new data sampling and evaluation strategies that better reflect likely use-cases.

    "translated_abstract": "词形变化是一个具有实践和认知应用的亚词汇自然语言处理任务。多年来，最先进的系统报告了在各种数据集和语言中高但也高度可变的性能。本文研究了高性能和高可变性的原因，并发现了数据集创建和评估中的几个方面在系统上系统地提高了性能，并掩盖了语言之间的差异。为了改善结果的通用性和可靠性，我们提出了更好地反映可能用例的新数据采样和评估策略。使用这些新策略，我们就当前变形系统的泛化能力做出了新的发现。",
