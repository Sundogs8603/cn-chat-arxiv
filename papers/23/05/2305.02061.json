    "translated_abstract": "在智能交通系统领域，协作感知作为一种新的方法已经被提出。通过实现多智能体之间的信息交换，以提高整个系统的感知能力，从而克服个体感知的局限性。协作感知克服了个体感知器件的局限性，使连接代理人能够感知超出他们视线和视野之外的环境。然而，协作感知的可靠性在很大程度上取决于数据聚合策略和通信带宽，必须克服有限网络资源带来的挑战。为了提高物体检测的精度和缓解有限的网络资源，我们提出了一种基于图注意力网络（GAT）的中间协作感知方案。所提出的方法采用了一种基于注意力的聚合策略，用于融合多个连接代理人之间交换的中间表示。该方法提高了多智能体感知的整体精度，而不需要显著增加网络资源。",
