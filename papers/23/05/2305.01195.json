    "translated_abstract": "对话话题转移检测是指检测对话中正在进行的话题是否转移或应该转移。任务可分为已知回复任务和未知回复任务。目前，只有少数针对后者进行了研究，因为在没有回复信息的情况下预测话题转移仍然是一项挑战。本文首先注释了一个由1308个对话组成的中文自然话题对话（CNTD）语料库，以填补中文自然会话话题语料库的空白。然后，我们专注于未知回复任务，并提出了一种基于分层对比学习的师生框架来预测没有回复的话题转移。具体而言，在高级师生响应中引入对比学习，用于建立响应和上下文之间的对比学习，而在低级学生中构建标签对比学习。在我们的中文CNTD和英文TIAGE上的实验结果表明了其有效性。",
