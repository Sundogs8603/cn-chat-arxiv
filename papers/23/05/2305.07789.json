    "abstract": "The dominant paradigm of textual question answering systems is based on end-to-end neural networks, which excels at answering natural language questions but falls short on complex ones. This stands in contrast to the broad adaptation of semantic parsing approaches over structured data sources (e.g., relational database, knowledge graphs), that convert natural language questions to logical forms and execute them with query engines. Towards combining the strengths of neural and symbolic methods, we propose a framework of question parsing and execution on textual QA. It comprises two central pillars: (1) We parse the question of varying complexity into an intermediate representation, named H-expression, which is composed of simple questions as the primitives and symbolic operations representing the relationships among them; (2) To execute the resulting H-expressions, we design a hybrid executor, which integrates the deterministic rules to translate the symbolic operations with a drop-in n",

    "translated_abstract": "文本问答系统的主导模式是基于端到端的神经网络，其在回答自然语言问题方面表现突出，但在回答复杂问题方面表现不足。这与基于语义解析的方法在结构化数据源（如关系数据库、知识图谱）上广泛适应形成对比，后者将自然语言问题转换为逻辑形式，并利用查询引擎进行执行。为了结合神经和符号方法的优势，我们提出了一种在文本问答系统中进行解析和执行问题的框架。它包括两个中心支柱：（1）我们将各种复杂问题解析成中间表示，称为H表达式，它由简单问题组成原语和表示它们之间关系的符号操作组成；（2）为了执行产生的H表达式，我们设计了一个混合执行器，它集成了确定规则来翻译符号操作，与处理原始问题的插入神经模块。我们在包含复杂问题的大规模基准数据集上评估了我们的方法，并在准确性和效率指标方面取得了最先进的表现。",

    "en_tdlr": "A hybrid question parsing and execution framework is proposed to answer complex questions over text, combining the strengths of neural and symbolic methods. The framework parses questions into H-expression and designs a hybrid executor to execute the resulting expressions using deterministic rules and a drop-in neural module. State-of-the-art performance in accuracy and efficiency metrics is achieved on a large-scale benchmark dataset."
