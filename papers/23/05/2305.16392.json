Once the diameter is known, a comparison with visible light observations can be used to find the visible geometric albedo of the body. One of the largest datasets of asteroid albedos comes from the NEOWISE mission, which measured asteroid albedos both in the visible and infrared. We model these albedos as a function of proper elements available from the Asteroid Families Portal using an ensemble of neural networks. We find that both the visible and infrared geometric albedos are significantly correlated with asteroid position in the belt and occur in both asteroid families and in the background belt. We find that the ensemble's prediction reduces the average error in albedo by about 37% compared to a model that simply adopts an average",

    "translated_abstract": "传统上很难估计小行星的直径。当直接观测不可能通过食变或直接雷达观测测量直径时，最常见的方法是从红外观测中近似估算直径。一旦直径知道，便可以利用可见光观测与之比较得到物体的可见几何反照率。NEOWISE 任务提供了最大的小行星反照率数据集，可同时测量可见光和红外光的反照率。我们使用一组神经网络将这些反照率建模为可从 Asteroid Families Portal 获取的 Proper Elements 的函数。我们发现可见和红外几何反照率都与小行星在带中的位置显着相关，并且在小行星族和背景带中都存在。与仅采用平均值模型相比，我们发现集合的预测将反照率的平均误差降低了约 37％。",
