    "translated_abstract": "实现自动驾驶的一个重要步骤是基于传感器输入对车辆环境进行建模。由于其众所周知的优势，雷达成为推断围绕车辆的网格单元占用状态的流行选择。为了解决雷达检测数据稀疏性和噪声问题，我们提出了一种基于深度学习的逆向传感器模型（ISM），用于学习从稀疏雷达检测到极坐标测量网格的映射。改进的基于激光雷达测量的网格用作参考。学习到的雷达测量网格与雷达多普勒速度测量相结合，进一步用于生成动态网格地图（DGM）。在实际的高速公路情景实验中表明，我们的方法优于手工制作的几何ISM。与最先进的深度学习方法相比，我们的方法是第一个从有限视场（FOV）的雷达中学习极坐标方案的单帧测量网格的方法。学习框架使学习到的ISM可以直接嵌入到现有的贝叶斯状态估计方案中，以提高环境建模的准确性。",
