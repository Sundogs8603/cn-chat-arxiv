    "translated_abstract": "基于迁移学习的增材制造建模是一种新兴的领域，其可以重复使用历史产品的数据，并减少建模新产品时数据量不足的问题。虽然最近进行了一些尝试，但是应用迁移学习在增材制造建模方面的固有挑战却很少被讨论，例如使用哪个源域，需要多少目标数据，以及是否应用数据预处理技术等。本文旨在通过基于开源数据集制定的案例研究来回答这些问题。在该案例研究中，将五种迁移学习方法与决策树回归和人工神经网络相结合，构建了六个基于迁移学习的模型，并将其性能与基准决策树回归和人工神经网络在一个提出的验证框架中进行比较。比较结果用于量化所应用的迁移学习方法的性能，并从相似性、训练数据大小和数据预处理的角度进行讨论。",
