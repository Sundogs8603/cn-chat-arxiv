    "title": "Scale Matters: Attribution Meets the Wavelet Domain to Explain Model Sensitivity to Image Corruptions. (arXiv:2305.14979v1 [cs.CV])",
    "abstract": "Neural networks have shown remarkable performance in computer vision, but their deployment in real-world scenarios is challenging due to their sensitivity to image corruptions. Existing attribution methods are uninformative for explaining the sensitivity to image corruptions, while the literature on robustness only provides model-based explanations. However, the ability to scrutinize models' behavior under image corruptions is crucial to increase the user's trust. Towards this end, we introduce the Wavelet sCale Attribution Method (WCAM), a generalization of attribution from the pixel domain to the space-scale domain. Attribution in the space-scale domain reveals where and on what scales the model focuses. We show that the WCAM explains models' failures under image corruptions, identifies sufficient information for prediction, and explains how zoom-in increases accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "神经网络在计算机视觉方面表现出了出色的性能，但它们在实际应用中的部署由于对图像损坏的敏感性而具有挑战性。现有的属性方法对于解释对图像损坏的敏感性是无效的，而强健性领域的文献仅提供基于模型的解释。然而，在图像损坏的情况下，审查模型的行为能力对于提高用户信任至关重要。为此，我们介绍了Wavelet sCale Attribution Method (WCAM)，它是从像素域到空间尺度域的属性方法的概括。在空间尺度域中进行属性揭示了模型的关注点和尺度。我们展示WCAM解释了模型在图像破坏下的失效，确定了预测的足够信息，并解释了如何通过缩放增加准确性。",
