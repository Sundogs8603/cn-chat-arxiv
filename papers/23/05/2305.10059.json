    "translated_abstract": "预测性维护（PdM）方法旨在在设备故障之前安排维护工作。在这种情况下，检测自动取款机（ATM）的早期故障变得越来越重要，因为这些机器易受各种不可预测的故障影响。ATM通过生成大量的事件日志数据来跟踪执行状态，这些数据收集与故障事件无关的系统消息。 基于事件日志预测故障会导致额外的挑战，主要在于提取可能表示即将发生故障的事件序列的特征。因此，特征学习方法目前正在PdM中使用，其中从最小处理的传感器数据中自动学习有信息量的特征。但是，仍然存在如何利用这些方法来从基于事件日志的数据中导出相关特征的空白。为了填补这个空白，我们提出了基于卷积核的预测模型（MiniROCKET）用于早期ATM故障预测。我们提出的方法包括一种混合特征学习技术，通过结合深度学习、核方法和基于规则的特征选择从ATM事件日志中提取相关特征。我们对真实的ATM事件日志数据进行了广泛的实验，结果表明我们提出的方法在分类性能、稳定性、可解释性和可扩展性方面优于现有技术。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a hybrid feature learning approach based on convolutional kernels for early ATM fault prediction, which combines deep learning, kernel methods, and a rule-based feature selection to extract relevant features from ATM event-logs. Experimental results on real-world data show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification performance, stability, interpretability, and scalability."
