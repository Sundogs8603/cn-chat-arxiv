    "abstract": "Frame semantic parsing is an important component of task-oriented dialogue systems. Current models rely on a significant amount training data to successfully identify the intent and slots in the user's input utterance. This creates a significant barrier for adding new domains to virtual assistant capabilities, as creation of this data requires highly specialized NLP expertise. In this work we propose OpenFSP, a framework that allows for easy creation of new domains from a handful of simple labels that can be generated without specific NLP knowledge. Our approach relies on creating a small, but expressive, set of domain agnostic slot types that enables easy annotation of new domains. Given such annotation, a matching algorithm relying on sentence encoders predicts the intent and slots for domains defined by end-users. Extensive experiments on the TopV2 dataset shows that our model outperforms strong baselines in this simple labels setting.",

    "translated_abstract": "帧语义解析是面向任务的对话系统的重要组成部分。当前的模型需要大量的训练数据才能成功地识别用户输入话语中的意图和插槽。这在将新领域添加到虚拟助手功能时会产生重要障碍，因为这些数据的创建需要高度专业化的自然语言处理技能。在本文中，我们提出了OpenFSP，这是一个框架，可以从少量能够在不需要NLP知识的情况下生成的简单标签中方便地创建新领域。我们的方法依赖于创建一个小而富有表现力的、与领域无关的插槽类型集，以实现对新领域的简单注释。在给定这样的注释后，依赖于句子编码器的匹配算法预测由终端用户定义的领域的意图和插槽。在TopV2数据集上进行了深入的实验，结果表明我们的模型在这种简单标签设置下优于强基线模型。",
