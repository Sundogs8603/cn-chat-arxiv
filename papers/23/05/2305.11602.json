    "translated_abstract": "机器学习(ML)系统在许多应用领域取得了显著的性能。然而，在敏感的应用领域中，它们经常展现出不公平的行为，引发了严重的公平性关注。为了评估和测试公平性，工程师经常生成鉴别实例来暴露模型部署之前的不公平行为。然而，现有的基线忽略了生成的自然性，并产生偏离真实数据分布的实例，可能无法揭示实际的模型公平性，因为这些不自然的鉴别实例不可能出现在实践中。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一个名为潜在模拟器(LIMI)的框架，利用生成对抗网络(GAN)来生成更自然的个体鉴别实例，其中我们在GAN的语义潜在空间中模拟目标模型的决策边界，并进一步对其进行样本潜在实例的采样。",
