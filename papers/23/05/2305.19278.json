In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in Human-AI interaction called Symbiotic Artificial Intelligence with Shared Sensory Experiences (SAISSE), which aims to establish a mutually beneficial relationship between AI systems and human users through shared sensory experiences. By integrating multiple sensory input channels and processing human experiences, SAISSE fosters a strong human-AI bond, enabling AI systems to learn from and adapt to individual users, providing personalized support, assistance, and enhancement. Furthermore, we discuss the incorporation of memory storage units for long-term growth and development of both the AI system and its human user. As we address user privacy and ethical guidelines for responsible AI-human symbiosis, we also explore potential biases and inequalities in AI-human symbiosis and propose strategies to mitigate",

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能与人类智能的融合一直以来都是科幻小说和学术界的研究课题。本文提出了一种新的人机交互概念，名为共享感官体验的共生人工智能（SAISSE），旨在通过共享感官体验建立人工智能系统和人类用户之间的互惠关系。通过集成多种感官输入通道和处理人类体验，SAISSE促进了强大的人机关系，使人工智能系统能够从个人用户那里学习和适应，提供个性化的支持、帮助和增强。此外，我们还讨论了用于长期增长和发展人工智能系统和其人类用户的存储单元的整合。同时，我们还探讨了AI人类共生中的用户隐私和伦理准则，探讨了潜在的偏见和不平等现象，并提出缓解策略。",
