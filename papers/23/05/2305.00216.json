This letter thus proposes a specific physics-guided graph neural network (PG-GNN). The tailored graph modelling of AC and DC grids is firstly advanced to enhance the topology adaptability of the PG-GNN. To eschew unreliable experience emulation from data, AC/DC physics are embedded in the PG-GNN using duality.

Multi-PG-GNN is finally conducted to master varied DC control modes. Case study shows that, relative to the other 7 data-driven rivals, only the proposed method matches the performance of the model-based benchmark, also beats it in computational efficiency beyond 10 times.",

    "translated_abstract": "直流和交流混合系统规模不断扩大，需要比以往更快的电力流分析工具。这篇论文提出了一种特定的物理引导下的图神经网络（PG-GNN），通过提升 PG-GNN 的拓扑适应性，实现了对交、直流电网的定制图形建模。为了避免从数据中复制不可靠的经验，利用对偶原理将交、直流物理嵌入 PG-GNN 中。接着，提出一种基于增广拉格朗日法的学习方案，以帮助 PG-GNN 以无监督无标签的方式更好地学习非凸模式。最后进行多个PG-GNN来掌握不同的直流控制模式。案例研究表明，与其他7个数据驱动的竞争对手相比，只有本论文提出的方法与基于模型的基准达到相同的性能，在计算效率上甚至超过其10倍。",
