    "translated_abstract": "人工通用智能（AGI）需要全面的理解和生成能力，可以涵盖不同的模态和功能。综合AI是实现AGI的一种重要方法，通过组合多个模型来解决复杂的多模态任务。然而，缺乏一种灵活和可组合的平台来促进模型的高效和有效的组合和协调。本文提出了i-Code Studio，这是一个可配置和可组合的综合AI框架。 i-Code Studio以无fine-tuning方式协调多个预训练模型，以执行复杂的多模态任务。 i-Code Studio不仅提供简单的模型组合，还提供了一个综合、灵活和可组合的设置，使开发人员能够快速轻松地组合最先进的服务和技术，以满足他们的特定要求。i-Code Studio在多种零-shot多模态任务上取得了惊人的结果。",
