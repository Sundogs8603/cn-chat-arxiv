    "translated_abstract": "近年来，协作学习技术取得了显著进展，可以实现多个组织之间的私密模型训练。然而，企业在考虑与竞争对手共享数据时面临着困境——虽然协作可以改善公司的机器学习模型，但也可能使竞争对手受益，从而降低利润。在这项工作中，我们引入了一个用于分析这种数据共享权衡的通用框架。该框架包括三个组成部分，分别代表企业的生产决策、额外数据对模型质量的影响以及数据共享协商过程。然后，我们研究了基于经济理论中的传统市场模型的框架实例，以确定影响协作激励的关键因素。我们的研究结果表明市场条件对数据共享激励具有深远影响。特别是，我们发现市场竞争的减少，即企业之间的相似性。",
    "tldr": "这项研究介绍了竞争对手之间战略数据共享的问题，提出了一个分析框架，研究了市场条件对数据共享激励的影响。",
