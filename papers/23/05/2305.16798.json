    "translated_abstract": "用户满意度建模（USM）是任务导向对话系统评估的一种流行选择，其中用户满意度通常取决于系统是否实现了用户的任务目标。任务导向对话系统使用任务架构（task schema）来编码用户的任务目标。现有的USM研究忽略了使用任务架构显式建模用户的任务目标实现。本文提出了一种新的基于模式的用户满意度建模框架SG-USM。它特别模拟了系统程度的满足用户关于任务属性的偏好程度，以预测用户的满意度水平。SG-USM使用预训练的语言模型来编码对话上下文和任务属性，并采用履行表示层来学习对话中完成了多少任务属性，重要性预测器用于计算任务属性的重要性，并利用注意机制选择性地关注重要任务属性以预测用户满意度。我们在任务导向对话数据集上评估了SG-USM，并显示它优于现有的USM模型。",
