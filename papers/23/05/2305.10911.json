We prove that CGF is a convex function, and we characterize the CGF maximization problem on the unit n-circle as a concave minimization problem. Then, we show that the CGF maximization approach can be interpreted as an extension of the standard principal component technique.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于最大化累积量生成函数(CGf)方向上的数据投影的多元数据异常检测算法。我们证明了CGF是一个凸函数，并将在单位n-圆上最大化CGF问题的特征描述为凹性最小化问题。然后，我们展示了CGF最大化方法可以被解释为标准主成分技术的扩展。为了验证和测试，我们在人工和实际金融数据上对我们的方法进行了全面比较。最后，我们将我们的方法应用为金融危机的早期检测器。",
