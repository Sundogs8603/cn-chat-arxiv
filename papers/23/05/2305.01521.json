    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种名为RECODE（基于聚类的在线密度估计强化学习方法）的非参数新颖性探索方法，其根据在所选择的嵌入空间中的相似性聚合状态并估计其访问次数。通过将经典聚类方法适应于深度强化学习的非平稳性环境，RECODE可在数千个回合中有效地跟踪状态访问计数。我们进一步提出了一种新颖的逆动力学损失的泛化形式，它利用掩码变压器结构进行多步预测。RECODE与此相结合，在DM-Hard-8的一系列具有挑战性的3D探索任务中实现了最新的最佳表现。在困难的Atari游戏中，RECODE也创造了新的最佳表现，并成为首个成功通关\"Pitfall!\"的代理。",
