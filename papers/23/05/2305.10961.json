    "abstract": "Prevention is better than cure. This old truth applies not only to the prevention of diseases but also to the prevention of issues with AI models used in medicine. The source of malfunctioning of predictive models often lies not in the training process but reaches the data acquisition phase or design of the experiment phase.  In this paper, we analyze in detail a single use case - a Kaggle competition related to the detection of abnormalities in X-ray lung images. We demonstrate how a series of simple tests for data imbalance exposes faults in the data acquisition and annotation process. Complex models are able to learn such artifacts and it is difficult to remove this bias during or after the training. Errors made at the data collection stage make it difficult to validate the model correctly.  Based on this use case, we show how to monitor data and model balance (fairness) throughout the life cycle of a predictive model, from data acquisition to parity analysis of model scores.",

    "translated_abstract": "“预防胜于治疗” 不仅适用于疾病预防，也适用于医疗人工智能模型问题的预防。预测模型失效的根源往往不在于训练过程，而是数据采集或实验设计阶段。本文以 Kaggle 竞赛为例，详细分析 X-光肺图像异常检测问题。我们演示了一系列简单的数据不平衡测试如何暴露出数据采集和标注过程中的问题。复杂模型能够学习这样的伪相，将其移除或改正后的训练是困难的。在数据收集阶段出现的错误使得模型正确验证变得困难。基于此案例，我们展示了如何在预测模型的整个生命周期中监控数据和模型平衡（公平性），从数据采集到模型分数的平衡分析。",
    "tldr": "本文以 Kaggle 竞赛为例，详细阐述了在医疗人工智能模型中，预防数据采集和标注阶段的问题要比训练过程中的修正更加重要，同时演示了如何通过数据不平衡测试，监控数据和模型平衡。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper emphasizes the importance of preventing issues in the data acquisition and annotation stages, rather than correcting them in the training process of medical AI models. By analyzing the Kaggle competition on X-ray lung image abnormalities detection, the authors demonstrate the use of simple data imbalance tests to monitor data and model fairness throughout the entire lifecycle of a predictive model."
