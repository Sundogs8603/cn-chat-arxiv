    "abstract": "Contemporary face detection algorithms have to deal with many challenges such as variations in pose, illumination, and scale. A subclass of the face detection problem that has recently gained increasing attention is occluded face detection, or more specifically, the detection of masked faces. Three years on since the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is still a complete lack of evidence regarding how well existing face detection algorithms perform on masked faces. This article first offers a brief review of state-of-the-art face detectors and detectors made for the masked face problem, along with a review of the existing masked face datasets. We evaluate and compare the performances of a well-representative set of face detectors at masked face detection and conclude with a discussion on the possible contributing factors to their performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "当前的人脸检测算法需要应对许多挑战，例如姿态，光照和比例的变化。最近吸引了越来越多的关注的一个子类别是遮挡脸部检测，或更具体地说，探测戴口罩的脸部。在新冠疫情爆发后的三年里，现有人脸检测算法在口罩人脸上的表现如何仍然缺乏实证证据。本文首先简要回顾了最先进的人脸检测器和专为口罩人脸问题而设计的检测器，以及现有的口罩人脸数据集。我们评估并比较了一组良好代表性的人脸检测器在口罩人脸检测方面的性能，并总结了关于其性能可能的贡献因素的讨论。",
