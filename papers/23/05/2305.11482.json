    "abstract": "The personalized dialogue explores the consistent relationship between dialogue generation and personality. Existing personalized dialogue agents model persona profiles from three resources: sparse or dense persona descriptions and dialogue histories. However, sparse structured persona attributes are explicit but uninformative, dense persona texts contain rich persona descriptions with much noise, and dialogue history query is both noisy and uninformative for persona modeling. In this work, we combine the advantages of the three resources to obtain a richer and more accurate persona. We design a Contrastive Latent Variable-based model (CLV) that clusters the dense persona descriptions into sparse categories, which are combined with the history query to generate personalized responses. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate our model's superiority in personalization.",

    "translated_abstract": "个性化对话探索了对话生成与个性之间的一致关系。现有的个性化对话模型从三个资源（稀疏或密集的个性描述以及对话历史记录）中建模个人资料。然而，稀疏的结构化个性属性是显性但无信息；密集的个性文本包含着丰富的个性描述与较多的噪声，而对话历史查询既嘈杂又无信息以供个性建模。本文将三个资源的优势进行结合，设计了一个基于对比潜在变量模型（CLV）的框架，将密集的个性描述聚类成稀疏的类别，然后和查询历史共同生成个性化回应。中英文数据集的实验结果表明，我们的模型在个性化上卓有成效。",
