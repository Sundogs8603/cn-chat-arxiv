    "translated_abstract": "近年来，发展形式化方法技术以指定或学习自主系统行为的大部分工作都基于这样一种信念，即形式化说明对于检查系统时人类是可解释和有用的。尽管这种假设经常被断言，但很少被测试。我们进行了一项人类实验（N = 62），混合了之前熟悉形式化方法以及不熟悉形式化方法的人，要求他们验证一组STL约束是否能让一个代理人在网格世界的旗帜争夺环境中避免危险并完成任务。验证准确度为$45\\%\\pm20\\%$（平均$\\pm$标准偏差）。事实上的说明有效性、被试熟悉形式化方法的程度以及被试的教育水平是决定验证正确性的重要因素。参与者表现出确认偏差，从而导致对有效说明的准确性显著提高，而对无效说明的准确性则显著降低。",
