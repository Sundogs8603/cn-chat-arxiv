    "abstract": "This work investigates pretrained audio representations for few shot Sound Event Detection. We specifically address the task of few shot detection of novel acoustic sequences, or sound events with semantically meaningful temporal structure, without assuming access to non-target audio. We develop procedures for pretraining suitable representations, and methods which transfer them to our few shot learning scenario. Our experiments evaluate the general purpose utility of our pretrained representations on AudioSet, and the utility of proposed few shot methods via tasks constructed from real-world acoustic sequences. Our pretrained embeddings are suitable to the proposed task, and enable multiple aspects of our few shot framework.",

    "translated_abstract": "本项工作探讨了预训练音频表示在少样本声事件检测中的应用。我们特别针对少样本检测新颖声学序列的任务进行研究，即在不假设非目标音频的情况下检测具有语义上有意义的时间结构的声事件。我们开发了预训练适当表示的过程，以及将它们转移到我们的少样本学习场景中的方法。我们的实验评估了我们预训练表示的通用效用，以及通过由真实世界的声学序列构成的任务来提出的少样本方法的效用。我们的预训练嵌入适用于所提出的任务，可以启用我们的少样本框架的多个方面。",
