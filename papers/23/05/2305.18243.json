In this study, we provide practical directions on how to use LLMs to generate 2D-game rooms for an under-development game, named Metavoidal. Our technique can harness the power of GPT-3 by Human-in-the-loop fine-tuning which allows our method to create 37% Playable-Novel levels from as scarce data as only 60 hand-designed rooms under a scenario of the non-trivial game, with respect to (Procedural Content Generation) PCG, that has a good amount of local and global constraints.",
