    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了美联储在应对全球金融危机时实施的货币政策。更具体地，分析了2007年至2018年美联储进行的定量宽松(QE)计划、流动性工具和前瞻性指导操作。本文对这些政策的详细审查导致了关于QE计划对美国通货膨胀和实际GDP的长期因果效应的中断时间序列(ITS)分析。这种正式的设计基础的自然实验方法的结果显示，QE操作对美国实际GDP产生了积极影响，但对美国通货膨胀没有显著影响。具体而言，对于QE后的2011Q2-2018Q4期间，相对于如果没有进行QE计划，美国的人均实际GDP每个季度平均增加了231美元。此外，结果表明，在QE计划开始十年后的2018Q4，实际人均GDP大约比2008Q3高出7.2％。",
