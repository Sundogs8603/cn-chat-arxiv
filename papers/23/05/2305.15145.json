    "translated_abstract": "在实际的跨国电商公司，如亚马逊和eBay，服务于多个国家和地区。一些市场的数据稀缺，而其他市场的数据丰富。近年来，跨市场推荐（XMR）已经提出，通过利用来自数据丰富市场的辅助信息来增强数据稀缺市场。先前的XMR算法采用了共享底层或整合市场间相似性等技术来优化XMR的性能。然而，现有方法存在两个关键限制：（1）忽略了数据丰富市场提供的物品共现性；（2）没有充分解决不同市场之间的差异导致的负迁移问题。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一种新颖的基于会话的模型，称为Bert4XMR，它能够对不同市场的物品共现性进行建模和缓解负迁移。具体而言，我们采用预训练和微调的范式来促进模型的学习和性能优化。",
