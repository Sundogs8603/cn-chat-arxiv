    "translated_abstract": "大部分已有的视觉推理任务，例如VQA中的CLEVR，忽略了一个重要因素：变换。它们仅用于测试机器在静态环境（例如单个图像）中理解概念和关系的能力。这种仅关注状态的视觉推理存在限制，不能很好地反映不同状态之间动态推断的能力，而在Piaget的理论中，这种推断能力同样重要。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的“以变换为驱动”的视觉推理（TVR）任务。给定初始和最终状态，目标是推断相应的中间变换。基于CLEVR，我们首先构建了一个名为TRANCE的新的合成数据集，其包括三个级别的设置：基本（单步变换）、事件（多步变换）和视图（多步变换与变形视图）。接下来，我们基于真实数据集构建了另一个名为TRANCO的数据集。",
