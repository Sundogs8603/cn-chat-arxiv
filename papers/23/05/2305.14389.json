    "translated_abstract": "乳腺癌是一种严重的健康威胁，目前尚无长期治愈方法。早期检测至关重要，但乳腺X线摄影的解释受到大量假阳性和假阴性的影响。随着乳腺癌例数有望超过肺癌，改进早期检测方法至关重要。红外热像技术结合人工智能提供了希望。本研究提出了一种基于注意力机制的卷积神经网络进行分割的方法，提高了乳腺癌检测和分类的速度和精度。该系统使用可解释人工智能对图像进行增强和进行癌症分割。我们提出了一个基于变压器注意力机制的卷积结构（UNet）用于故障识别，并使用梯度加权类激活映射（Grad-CAM）来分析在IRT图像中UNet结构的偏差和弱点区域。与现有最先进模型相比，我们提出的框架的优越性得到了证实。",
