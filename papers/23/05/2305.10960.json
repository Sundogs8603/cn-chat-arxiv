    "translated_abstract": "本文针对使用商用虚拟现实(VR)界面远程操作工业机器人操纵器的问题进行了研究。以往的VR机器人操纵远程操作主要集中在协作或研究机器人平台上（其动力学和约束不同于工业机器臂），或仅处理机器人动力学不太重要的任务（例如：拾取和放置任务）。我们研究了使用商用VR界面有效地远程操作工业机器人操纵器处理接触丰富的操纵任务。我们发现，将标准的VR机器人臂控制方法应用于工业平台是具有挑战性的，因为扭矩和速度控制没有暴露，位置控制是通过黑盒控制器介导的。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种简化的滤波方法来处理命令信号，以使操作员能够有效地使用VR界面远程操作工业机器人操纵器。",
