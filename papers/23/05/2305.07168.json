    "abstract": "Local news has become increasingly important in the news industry due to its various benefits. It offers local audiences information that helps them participate in their communities and interests. It also serves as a reliable source of factual reporting that can prevent misinformation. Moreover, it can influence national audiences as some local stories may have wider implications for politics, environment or crime. Hence, detecting the exact geolocation and impact scope of local news is crucial for news recommendation systems. There are two fundamental things required in this process, (1) classify whether an article belongs to local news, and (2) identify the geolocation of the article and its scope of influence to recommend it to appropriate users.

    "translated_abstract": "由于其各种好处，本地新闻在新闻行业中变得越来越重要。 它为当地观众提供信息，帮助他们参与社区和兴趣。 它还作为可靠的事实报道来源，可以防止错误信息。 此外，它可以影响国家观众，因为一些本地故事可能对政治，环境或犯罪产生更广泛的影响。 因此，检测本地新闻的确切地理位置和影响范围对于新闻推荐系统至关重要。 在这篇论文中，我们专注于第二步，并提出（1）一个有效的方法来确定本地新闻文章的位置和半径，（2）一种将用户位置与文章位置协调的方法，以及（3）一个度量标准来评估该方法的性能。",
