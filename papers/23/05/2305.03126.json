    "abstract": "Timely pre- and post-diagnosis check-ups are critical for cancer patients, across all cancer types, as these often lead to better outcomes. Several socio-demographic properties have been identified as strongly connected with both cancer's clinical dynamics and (indirectly) with different individual check-up behaviors. Unfortunately, existing check-up policies typically consider only the former association explicitly. In this work, we propose a novel framework, accompanied by a high-resolution computer simulation, to investigate and optimize socio-demographic-based SMS reminder campaigns for cancer check-ups. We instantiate our framework and simulation for the case of bladder cancer, the 10th most prevalent cancer today, using extensive real-world data. Our results indicate that optimizing an SMS reminder campaign based solely on simple socio-demographic features can bring about a statistically significant reduction in mortality rate compared to alternative campaigns by up to 5.8%.",

    "translated_abstract": "及时进行癌症的预后和诊断检查对于各类型的癌症患者来说都至关重要，这通常会带来更好的治疗效果。不幸的是，现有的检查政策只考虑与癌症的临床动力学密切相关的属性。本研究提出了一种新的框架和高分辨率计算机模拟，以调查和优化基于社会人口学的癌症检查短信提醒活动。我们利用大量的真实数据对膀胱癌进行了框架和模拟实例化。研究结果表明，仅基于简单的社会人口学特征优化短信提醒活动可以将死亡率的统计显著降低5.8％，与其他活动相比。",
