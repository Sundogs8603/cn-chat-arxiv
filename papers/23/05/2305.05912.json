In this paper, we propose a method to train a hybrid of discriminative and generative models in a single neural network (NN), which exhibits the characteristics of both models. The key idea is the Gaussian-coupled softmax layer, which is a fully connected layer with a softmax activation function coupled with Gaussian distributions. This layer can be embedded into an NN-based classifier and allows the classifier to estimate both the class posterior distribution and the class-conditional data distribution. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model can be applied to semi-supervised learning and confidence calibration.",
