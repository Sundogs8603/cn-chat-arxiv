    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍并探讨了一种新的编程范式——基于模型的编程，旨在解决将深度学习模型应用于实际应用时所面临的挑战。尽管深度学习模型在各种任务上取得了重大成功，但将它们部署到实际业务场景中仍然存在困难，如复杂的模型训练、大量的计算资源需求以及与现有编程语言的集成问题。为了缓解这些挑战，我们提出了“基于模型的编程”概念，并推出了一种新颖的编程语言——M语言，该语言针对预期的以模型为中心的编程范式而设计。M语言将模型视为基本的计算单位，使开发人员能够更专注于关键任务，如模型加载、微调、评估和部署，从而增强创建深度学习应用程序的效率。我们认为，这种创新的编程范式将彻底改变我们使用深度学习模型的方式。",
