    "translated_abstract": "基于扩散的生成图模型已被证明在生成高质量小图方面非常有效。然而，它们需要更可扩展性，以生成包含数千个节点的大图并满足图统计。本文提出了EDGE，一种新的基于扩散的生成图模型，用于生成大型图的生成任务。为了提高计算效率，我们通过在每个时间步长随机删除边来鼓励图的稀疏性，并最终获得一张空白图。EDGE仅在每个去噪步骤中关注图中一部分节点。它比以前的基于扩散的模型更少地进行边预测。此外，EDGE明确地允许对图的节点度数进行建模，进一步提高了模型的性能。实证研究表明，EDGE比竞争方法更有效，并且可以生成具有数千个节点的大型图。它还在生成质量方面优于基准模型。",
