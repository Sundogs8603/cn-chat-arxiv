    "translated_abstract": "量子计算的迅猛发展导致了对从量子系统中提取经典信息的有效技术的广泛需求，尤其是在量子机器学习和量子化学等领域。然而，量子系统本质上容易受到噪声的影响，从而损坏量子系统中编码的信息。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一种有效的算法，可以在Pauli噪声下从量子状态中恢复信息。其核心思想是通过后处理通道的经典阴影来学习未知Pauli通道的必要信息。对于局部和有界度数的可观察量，只需要通道的部分信息而不是其完整的经典描述就可以恢复理想的信息，从而产生一个多项式时间算法。这与常规方法（如概率误差消除）形成对比，后者需要通道的完整信息并展示指数级扩展。",
