    "abstract": "Respiratory chest belt sensor can be used to measure the respiratory rate and other respiratory health parameters. Virtual Respiratory Belt, VRB, algorithms estimate the belt sensor waveform from speech audio. In this paper we compare the detection of inspiration events (IE) from respiratory belt sensor data using a novel neural VRB algorithm and the detections based on time-aligned linguistic content. The results show the superiority of the VRB method over word pause detection or grammatical content segmentation. The comparison of the methods show that both read and spontaneous speech content has a significant amount of ungrammatical breathing, that is, breathing events that are not aligned with grammatically appropriate places in language. This study gives new insights into the development of VRB methods and adds to the general understanding of speech breathing behavior. Moreover, a new VRB method, VRBOLA, for the reconstruction of the continuous breathing waveform is demonstrated.",

    "translated_abstract": "呼吸胸带传感器可以用于测量呼吸率和其他呼吸健康参数。虚拟呼吸胸带（VRB）算法可以从语音音频估算出胸带传感器波形。本文比较了使用一种新颖的神经网络VRB算法和基于时间对齐语言内容的检测来自胸带传感器数据的吸气事件（IE）的能力。结果表明，VRB方法优于单词暂停检测或语法内容分割。方法的比较显示，朗读和自发语言内容都具有显着的非语法性呼吸，即呼吸事件不与语言中的语法正确的位置对齐。该研究为VRB方法的开发提供了新的见解，并增加了对语音呼吸行为的普遍理解。此外，演示了一种连续呼吸波形的重建新VRB方法VRBOLA。",
