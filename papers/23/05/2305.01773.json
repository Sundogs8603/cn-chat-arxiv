    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络通常被用于建模相互作用的动态系统，因为它们优雅地适应于具有变化和大量代理的系统。虽然在确定性相互作用系统方面取得了很多进展，但对于有兴趣获得未来轨迹的预测分布的随机系统，模型更具挑战性。现有方法要么计算速度慢，因为它们依赖于蒙特卡罗抽样，要么做出简化假设，使得预测分布是单峰的。在本文中，我们提出了一个深度状态空间模型，它采用图神经网络来建模底层的相互作用动态系统。预测分布是多峰的，并且具有高斯混合模型的形式，其中高斯分量的矩可以通过确定性矩匹配规则计算。我们的矩匹配方案可以用于无样本推断，从而实现更有效和稳定的预测。实验结果表明，我们的方法能够有效地建模和预测随机系统的轨迹，即使存在巨大的不确定性。",
