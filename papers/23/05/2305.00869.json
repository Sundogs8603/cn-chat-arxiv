    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习中，密度比$p/q$的函数被广泛用于量化两个分布$p$和$q$之间的离差。对于高维分布，基于二元分类的密度比估计器表现出很大的潜力。然而，当密度分离良好时，使用二元分类器估算密度比是具有挑战性的。本文展示了最新的密度比估计器在密度分离良好的情况下表现差，并证明这是由于训练和评估时发生的分布偏移问题。我们提出了一种另类方法，利用多类分类进行密度比估计，并且不受到分布偏移的影响。该方法使用一组辅助密度$\\{m_k\\}_{k=1}^K$，并训练一个多类逻辑回归对样本从$p，q$和$\\{m_k\\}_{k=1}^K$分类成$K+2$类。我们证明，如果这些辅助密度被构造为满足最大密度比值条件，则多类逻辑回归可以一致地估计密度比。",
