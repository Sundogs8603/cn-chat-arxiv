Recent work has used projections of embeddings from Distributional Semantic Models (DSMs), such as BERT, to perform these measurements.

Here, we propose and evaluate three novel, entity-centric methods for learning stereotypes from Twitter and Wikipedia biographies. Models are trained by leveraging the fact that multiple phrases are applied to the same person, magnifying the person-centric nature of the learned associations. We show that these models outperform existing approaches to stereotype measurement with respect to 1) predicting which identities people apply to themselves and others, and 2) quantifying stereotypes on salient social dimensions (e.g. gender).

    "translated_abstract": "刻板印象影响我们如何展示自己和他人，从而影响我们的行为。因此，衡量刻板印象非常重要。最近的研究使用分布语义模型（DSM）（如BERT）中嵌入的投影来进行这些测量。然而，DSMs捕捉到的认知联想不一定与刻板印象的人际性质相关。在这里，我们提出并评估了三种新的以实体为中心的方法，从Twitter和Wikipedia传记中学习刻板印象。通过利用多个短语应用于同一个人的事实来训练模型，扩大了学习联想的人本身中心性。我们证明了这些模型在预测人们如何将身份标签应用于自己和他人以及量化突出的社会维度（如性别）的刻板印象方面优于现有方法。通过一个案例研究，我们还展示了这些模型对未来计算社会科学问题的实用性。",
