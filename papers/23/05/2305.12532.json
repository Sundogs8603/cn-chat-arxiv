    "abstract": "Automated text simplification aims to produce simple versions of complex texts. This task is especially useful in the medical domain, where the latest medical findings are typically communicated via complex and technical articles. This creates barriers for laypeople seeking access to up-to-date medical findings, consequently impeding progress on health literacy. Most existing work on medical text simplification has focused on monolingual settings, with the result that such evidence would be available only in just one language (most often, English). This work addresses this limitation via multilingual simplification, i.e., directly simplifying complex texts into simplified texts in multiple languages. We introduce MultiCochrane, the first sentence-aligned multilingual text simplification dataset for the medical domain in four languages: English, Spanish, French, and Farsi. We evaluate fine-tuned and zero-shot models across these languages, with extensive human assessments and analyses. ",

    "translated_abstract": "自动化文本简化旨在产生复杂文本的简化版本。在医学领域，这项任务尤为重要，因为最新的医学发现通常通过复杂和技术性的文章进行传播。这为寻求最新医学发现信息的普通人造成了障碍，进而阻碍了健康素养的提高。大部分医学文本简化的现有工作都集中在单语言环境中，导致这些证据只能用一种语言（通常是英语）提供。本研究通过多语言简化直接将复杂文本简化为多种语言的简化文本来解决这个问题。我们介绍了MultiCochrane，这是医学领域中第一个四种语言（英语、西班牙语、法语和波斯语）的句子对齐多语言文本简化数据集。我们通过广泛的人工评估和分析，在这些语言之间评估了模型的微调和零样本模型。",
