    "en_tdlr": "This paper compares and evaluates different methods for estimating conditional Shapley values, and provides new techniques and expanded approaches for addressing this problem, which can be challenging due to the need to estimate complex conditional expectations. The methods are systematically classified and evaluated based on Monte Carlo integration or regression modeling, and extensive simulations are used to assess their precision and reliability."
