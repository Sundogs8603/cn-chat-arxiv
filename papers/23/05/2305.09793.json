To overcome this challenge, this paper explores the control Lyapunov barrier function (CLBF) to analyze the safety and reachability solely based on data without explicitly employing a dynamic model. We also proposed the Lyapunov barrier actor-critic (LBAC), a model-free RL algorithm, to search for a controller that satisfies the data-based approximation of the safety and reachability conditions.

    "translated_abstract": "当面对复杂的机器人控制任务时，强化学习（RL）展现了优异的性能。然而，由于缺乏强大的安全保障，其在物理机器人上的广泛应用受到了限制。为了克服这一挑战，本文探讨了控制李亚普诺夫屏障函数（CLBF），仅基于数据分析安全性和可达性，而无需明确使用动态模型。我们还提出了LyapunovBarrierActor-Critic（LBAC）算法，这是一种基于模型的强化学习算法，用于寻找满足基于数据的安全和可达性条件的控制器。我们通过仿真和真实机器人控制实验，即2D四旋翼导航任务，展示了所提出方法的有效性。实验结果表明，此方法在可达性和安全性方面的效果优于其他基于模型的强化学习方法。",
