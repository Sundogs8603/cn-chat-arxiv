    "translated_abstract": "神经辐射场（NeRF）利用2D图像和相机姿态进行3D场景重建以进行新颖视图合成。尽管NeRF能产生逼真的结果，但它经常遭受过拟合于训练视图的困扰，导致几何重建不佳，尤其是在低纹理区域。这种限制限制了许多需要准确几何形态的重要应用，例如外推NVS，高清映射和场景编辑。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的方法，仅使用RGB图像和语义地图即可改善NeRF的三维结构。我们的方法引入了基于奇异值分解（SVD）的新颖平面正则化，不依赖于任何几何先验知识。此外，我们在我们的损失设计中利用结构相似性指数测量（SSIM）来正确初始化NeRF的体积表示。定量和定性的结果表明，我们的方法优于流行的正则化方法以实现准确的几何重建。",
