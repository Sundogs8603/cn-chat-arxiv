    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了一个重要而具有挑战性的问题——建模异质市场中金融指标等多变量之间的高维依赖关系。在现实中，一个市场随时间发展不断影响其他市场，并且一个市场的金融变量也存在耦合关系。我们首次尝试将变分顺序神经学习与基于Copula的依赖建模相结合，以描述跨非正常多变量的时间可观测和潜在变量的依赖程度和结构。我们的变分神经网络WPVC-VLSTM通过变分长短期记忆网络和常规藤Copula对多元时间序列中的变分序列依赖程度和结构进行建模。常规藤Copula对多个动态变量之间的非正态和长程分布耦合进行建模。WPVC-VLSTM在技术显著性和组合预测性能方面得到验证。它优于包括l在内的基准模型。",
