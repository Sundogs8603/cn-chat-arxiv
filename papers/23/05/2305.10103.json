    "abstract": "Social Networks represent one of the most important online sources to share content across a world-scale audience. In this context, predicting whether a post will have any impact in terms of engagement is of crucial importance to drive the profitable exploitation of these media. In the literature, several studies address this issue by leveraging direct features of the posts, typically related to the textual content and the user publishing it. In this paper, we argue that the rise of engagement is also related to another key component, which is the semantic connection among posts published by users in social media. Hence, we propose TweetGage, a Graph Neural Network solution to predict the user engagement based on a novel graph-based model that represents the relationships among posts. To validate our proposal, we focus on the Twitter platform and perform a thorough experimental campaign providing evidence of its quality.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交网络是最重要的在线内容分享平台之一，预测发布内容的互动情况是利用社交媒体实现盈利的关键。本文认为发布的内容之间的语义关联也是互动数增长的关键因素。因此，我们提出了TweetGage，一个基于图的神经网络解决方案，通过新颖的基于图的模型来表示帖子间的关系，从而预测用户的互动。为了验证我们的提议，我们针对Twitter平台进行了全面的实验研究，证明了该方法的优良性能。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出TweetGage，一个基于图神经网络的解决方案，通过表示发布帖子间的语义关联来预测用户在社交媒体上的互动，相对其他研究只考虑帖子文本和发布用户等因素，有效提高了预测准确性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes TweetGage, a graph neural network solution to predict user engagement on social media by representing the semantic connections among posted content. It outperforms other studies that only consider direct features such as text and user information, and effectively improves engagement prediction accuracy."
