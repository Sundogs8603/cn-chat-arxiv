    "abstract": "Unsupervised commonsense reasoning (UCR) is becoming increasingly popular as the construction of commonsense reasoning datasets is expensive, and they are inevitably limited in their scope. A popular approach to UCR is to fine-tune language models with external knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs), but this usually requires a large number of training examples. In this paper, we propose to transform the downstream multiple choice question answering task into a simpler binary classification task by ranking all candidate answers according to their reasonableness. To this end, for training the model, we convert the knowledge graph triples into reasonable and unreasonable texts. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach on various multiple choice question answering benchmarks. Furthermore, compared with existing UCR approaches using KGs, ours is less data hungry. Our code is available at https://github.com/probe2/BUCA.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着常识推理数据集的构建变得越来越昂贵且在范围上不可避免地受限，无监督的常识推理(UCR)变得越来越流行。UCR的一种流行方法是利用外部知识将语言模型进行微调(例如，知识图谱)，但这通常需要大量的训练样例。在本文中，我们提出将下游的多项选择题回答任务转换为一个更简单的二分类任务，通过对所有候选答案的合理性进行排名来完成。为了训练模型，我们将知识图谱三元组转换为合理和不合理的文本。广泛的实验结果显示了我们的方法在各种多项选择问题回答基准测试中的有效性。此外，与使用KG的现有UCR方法相比，我们的方法更节省数据。我们的代码可在https://github.com/probe2/BUCA上获取。",
