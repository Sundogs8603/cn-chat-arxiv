    "translated_abstract": "医疗对话系统旨在为患者提供准确的答案，需要特定的领域知识。大型语言模型（LLMs）的最近进展已经证明了其在医疗问答领域具有杰出的能力，表明具备了对常识的丰富理解。然而，由于缺乏诊断策略，LLMs无法直接用于诊断。传统的解决方法是昂贵的LLMs微调。另一种更具吸引力的解决方法是开发一个插件，赋予LLMs执行医疗对话任务的能力。受到上下文学习的启发，我们提出了PlugMed，一个即插即用的医疗对话系统，通过两个模块促进了LLMs的恰当对话动作：提示生成（PG）模块和回复排名（RR）模块。PG模块旨在从全局和局部角度捕获对话信息。它通过评估匹配度来选择合适的提示。",
