    "translated_abstract": "本研究介绍了我们团队PathToMyHeart在2022年George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge中的贡献。我们实现了两个模型。第一个模型是双重贝叶斯ResNet（DBRes），将每个患者的记录分段成重叠的log mel音谱图进行两个二分类：存在与未知或不存在，未知与存在或不存在。这些分类结果进行聚合，以得出患者的最终分类。第二个模型是将DBRes的输出与人口统计学数据和信号特征进行整合，使用XGBoost进行分类。DBRes在隐含测试集的杂音分类中取得了$0.771$的最佳加权准确率，使我们在杂音任务中排名第四。（在我们忽略了临床结局任务的情况下，我们的得分为$12637$。）在我们的训练集子集上，将人口统计学数据和信号特征整合后，DBRes的准确率从$0.762$提高到了$0.820$。但是，这降低了DBRes的加权准确率。",
