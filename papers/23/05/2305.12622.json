    "translated_abstract": "健康的社会决定因素（SDOH）──人们居住、成长和老去的条件──对一个人的健康和幸福起着至关重要的作用。人口健康研究中的大量有力证据显示，各种各样的SDOH与健康结果密切相关。然而，大多数基于电子健康记录（EHR）的风险预测模型并没有涵盖全面的SDOH特征，因为它们通常噪声很大或者根本无法获取。我们的研究将一个公开可用的EHR数据库MIMIC-IV与被充分记录的SDOH特征联系起来。我们研究了这些特征对不同患者群体的常见EHR预测任务的影响。我们发现，对于一般的患者群体来说，社区层面的SDOH特征并不能提高模型的性能，但可以提高特定亚群体的数据受限模型的公平性。我们还证明，SDOH特征对于进行详尽的算法偏见审计非常重要。",
