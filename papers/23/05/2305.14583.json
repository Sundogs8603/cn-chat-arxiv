    "abstract": "Language is multifaceted. A given utterance can be re-expressed in equivalent forms, and its implicit and explicit content support various logical and pragmatic inferences. When processing an utterance, we consider these different aspects, as mediated by our interpretive goals -- understanding that \"it's dark in here\" may be a veiled direction to turn on a light. Nonetheless, NLP methods typically operate over the surface form alone, eliding this nuance.  In this work, we represent language with language, and direct an LLM to decompose utterances into logical and plausible inferences. The reduced complexity of the decompositions makes them easier to embed, opening up novel applications. Variations on our technique lead to state-of-the-art improvements on sentence embedding benchmarks, a substantive application in computational political science, and to a novel construct-discovery process, which we validate with human annotations.",

    "translated_abstract": "语言是多元化的，一个表述可以用等价的形式重申，而其中的隐含和显性内容支持各种逻辑和语用推理。在处理表述时，我们考虑这些不同的方面，因为我们需要理解“这里很黑”可能是一个暗示需要打开灯。然而，NLP方法通常仅仅基于表面形式操作，省略了这种细微差别。在这项工作中，我们用语言来表示语言，并引导LLM将表述分解为逻辑和可信的推理。分解的降低复杂性，使它们更容易嵌入，开启了新的应用。我们的技术变化在句子嵌入基准测试中实现了最先进的改进，在计算政治学中有实质性应用，并引出一种新的构建发现过程，我们用人工注释验证了这种过程。",
