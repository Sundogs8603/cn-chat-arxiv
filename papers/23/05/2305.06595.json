    "abstract": "The analysis of consumer sentiment, as expressed through reviews, can provide a wealth of insight regarding the quality of a product. While the study of sentiment analysis has been widely explored in many popular languages, relatively less attention has been given to the Bangla language, mostly due to a lack of relevant data and cross-domain adaptability. To address this limitation, we present BanglaBook, a large-scale dataset of Bangla book reviews consisting of 158,065 samples classified into three broad categories: positive, negative, and neutral. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset and employ a range of machine learning models to establish baselines including SVM, LSTM, and Bangla-BERT. Our findings demonstrate a substantial performance advantage of pre-trained models over models that rely on manually crafted features, emphasizing the necessity for additional training resources in this domain. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth error analysis by examining se",

    "translated_abstract": "消费者情感分析可以通过评论表达提供有关产品质量的丰富见解。尽管情感分析的研究在许多流行语言中得到了广泛探索，但由于缺乏相关数据和跨领域适应性，相对较少关注孟加拉语言。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了 BanglaBook，这是一个大规模的孟加拉语书评数据集，包括 158,065 个样本，分为三个大类：积极、消极和中性。我们对数据集进行了详细的统计分析，并使用一系列机器学习模型建立了基线，包括 SVM、LSTM 和 Bangla-BERT。我们的研究结果表明，与依赖手动构建特征的模型相比，预训练模型具有显着的性能优势，强调了在此领域需要额外的培训资源。此外，我们通过检查情感错误分类来进行深入的错误分析，并提供有关孟加拉情感分析性质的进一步见解。",
