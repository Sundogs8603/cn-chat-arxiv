In the research community, very little focus is on how humans generate answers to a question and how this behavior can be incorporated in a language model. In this paper, we want to explore these two areas combined, i.e., how sampling can be to used generate answers which are close to human-like behavior and factually correct. Hence, the type of decoding algorithm we think should be used for Q/A tasks should also depend on the keywords. These keywords can be obtained from the question, passage or interne",
