    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel generator called Perturbation-Assisted Sample Synthesis (PASS), designed for drawing reliable conclusions from complex data, especially when using advanced modeling techniques like deep neural networks. PASS utilizes perturbation to generate synthetic data that closely mirrors the distribution of raw data, encompassing numerical and unstructured data types such as gene expression, images, and text. By estimating the data-generating distribution and leveraging large pre-trained generative models, PASS enhances estimation accuracy, providing an estimated distribution of any statistic through Monte Carlo experiments. Building on PASS, we propose a generative inference framework called Perturbation-Assisted Inference (PAI), which offers a statistical guarantee of validity. In pivotal inference, PAI enables accurate conclusions without knowing a pivotal's distribution as in simulations, even with limited data. In non-pivotal situations, we train PASS using an i",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种名为“扰动辅助样本合成（PASS）”的新型生成器，旨在从复杂数据中绘制可靠的结论，特别是在使用深度神经网络等高级建模技术时。 PASS利用扰动生成靠近原始数据分布的合成数据，包括数字和非结构化数据类型，如基因表达、图像和文本。通过估计数据生成分布并利用大型预训练生成模型，PASS提高了估计精度，并通过蒙特卡罗实验证明了任何统计数据的估计分布。基于PASS，我们提出了一种生成推理框架称为“扰动辅助推理（PAI）”，它提供了有效性的统计保证。在关键推理中，PAI使得在不知道引导分布（如模拟中）的情况下能够得出准确的结论，即使只有有限的数据。在非关键情况下，我们训练PASS使用中间变量插补策略来提高准确性。实验结果表明，在各种情况下，包括时间序列预测、图像分类和文本生成，PASS和PAI都优于现有最先进的替代品。",
