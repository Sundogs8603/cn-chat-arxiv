    "translated_abstract": "我们在对抗鲁棒性的背景下提出了对锐度感知优化（SAM）的新理解。本文指出，SAM和对抗性训练（AT）都可以视为特定的特征扰动，其改善了对抗鲁棒性。然而，SAM和AT在扰动强度方面是不同的，从而带来了不同的精度和鲁棒性权衡。在一个简化模型中，我们提供了这些声明的理论证据和严格的数学证明。此外，我们进行了实验证明，仅利用SAM可以实现比标准训练更好的对抗鲁棒性，这是意外的好处。由于对抗训练可能会导致清晰度精度的降低，我们展示了仅使用SAM可以在不牺牲清晰度精度的情况下提高鲁棒性。源代码可在https://github.com/weizeming/SAM_AT获取。",
