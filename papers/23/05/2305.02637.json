    "abstract": "As pointed out by several scholars, current research on hate speech (HS) recognition is characterized by unsystematic data creation strategies and diverging annotation schemata. Subsequently, supervised-learning models tend to generalize poorly to datasets they were not trained on, and the performance of the models trained on datasets labeled using different HS taxonomies cannot be compared. To ease this problem, we propose applying extremely weak supervision that only relies on the class name rather than on class samples from the annotated data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a state-of-the-art weakly-supervised text classification model in various in-dataset and cross-dataset settings. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the source of poor generalizability of HS classification models.",

    "translated_abstract": "如多位学者指出的那样，当前针对仇恨言论（HS）识别的研究特点是不系统的数据创建策略和不同的注释方案。因此，监督学习模型往往对它们未被训练的数据集进行泛化性能差，并且不同HS分类法标记的数据集所训练的模型的性能无法比较。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种极度弱的监督方法，只依赖于类别名称而不是注释数据中的类别示例。我们展示了一种最先进的弱监督文本分类模型在各种数据集内和跨数据集的情况下的有效性。此外，我们对HS分类模型通用性较差的原因进行了深入的定量和定性分析。",
