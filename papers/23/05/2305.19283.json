Soccer Simulation 2D (SS2D) match involves two teams, including 11 players and a coach, competing against each other. The players can only communicate with the Soccer Simulation Server during the game. This paper presents the latest research of the CYRUS soccer simulation 2D team, the champion of RoboCup 2021.
