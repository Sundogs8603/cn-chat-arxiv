    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）的出现使得将它们的价值与人类价值对齐变得至关重要。当前的方法通常尝试将其与一种同质的人类价值对齐，并需要人类验证，但缺乏对对齐所需方面和深度的共识以及造成的人类偏见。在本文中，我们提出了一种自动对齐评估方法A2EHV，该方法采用异质价值系统，（1）是自动化的，以最小化单个人类偏见，并且（2）允许评估针对各种目标值的异质代理人。我们的方法基于价值合理性的概念，它代表了代理人执行最能满足目标价值行为的能力。价值合理性的量化是通过社会心理学中的社会价值定向框架进行的，该框架将价值空间分为四个类别，以评估代理人行为的社会偏好。我们评估了三个模型的价值合理性，结果表明A2EHV方法比传统对齐方法更合理。",

The approach is based on the concept of value rationality and Social Value Orientation framework to assess social preferences from agent's behaviors. A2EHV method is shown to be more reasonable in evaluating value rationality compared to traditional alignment methods."
