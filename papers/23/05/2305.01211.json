    "abstract": "Sentence Boundary Detection (SBD) is one of the foundational building blocks of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with incorrectly split sentences heavily influencing the output quality of downstream tasks. It is a challenging task for algorithms, especially in the legal domain, considering the complex and different sentence structures used. In this work, we curated a diverse multilingual legal dataset consisting of over 130'000 annotated sentences in 6 languages. Our experimental results indicate that the performance of existing SBD models is subpar on multilingual legal data. We trained and tested monolingual and multilingual models based on CRF, BiLSTM-CRF, and transformers, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. We also show that our multilingual models outperform all baselines in the zero-shot setting on a Portuguese test set. To encourage further research and development by the community, we have made our dataset, models, and code publicly available.",

    "translated_abstract": "句子边界检测是自然语言处理的基础之一，不正确的分割会严重影响下游任务的输出质量。对于算法来说是一个具有挑战性的任务，尤其对于法律领域，因为使用的复杂句子结构各不相同。本文精心策划了一个多语种法律数据集，包括6种语言的130,000个注释句子。我们的实验结果表明，现有的SBD模型在多语种法律数据上的性能表现不佳。我们训练和测试了基于CRF、BiLSTM-CRF和transformers的单语和多语模型，展示了最先进的性能。我们还展示了我们的多语模型在葡萄牙语测试集的零-shot设置中优于所有基线。为了鼓励社区进一步的研究和发展，我们已经公开了我们的数据集、模型和代码。",
