    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a unified algorithm for solving experimental design problems with a general $p$-norm objective, which includes well-studied objectives as special cases. By using a randomized local search approach, it becomes the first approximation algorithm for the general $p$-norm objective and interpolates the best known bounds of the special cases."
