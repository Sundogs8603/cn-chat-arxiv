    "translated_abstract": "数字乳腺摄影中的自动肿瘤检测是一项困难的任务，由于肿瘤很少出现，乳房组织变异和高分辨率。针对这个问题，鉴于异常图像的稀缺性和正常图像的丰富性，异常检测/定位方法可能非常适合。然而，机器学习中大部分异常定位研究集中在非医学数据集上，我们发现这些方法在医学图像数据集上适应性不足。这个问题可以通过解决图像完成视角下的任务得到缓解，其中异常的存在可以通过原始外观与其环境条件下自动完成之间的差异来指示。然而，在DBT数据集中，往往有很多相同环境条件下的有效的正常完成，使这个评估标准不太精确。为了解决这个问题，我们考虑通过探索完成的多元性来进行图像完成。",
