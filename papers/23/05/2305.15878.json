    "abstract": "Past research has identified a rich set of handcrafted linguistic features that can potentially assist various tasks. However, their extensive number makes it difficult to effectively select and utilize existing handcrafted features. Coupled with the problem of inconsistent implementation across research works, there has been no categorization scheme or generally-accepted feature names. This creates unwanted confusion. Also, most existing handcrafted feature extraction libraries are not open-source or not actively maintained. As a result, a researcher often has to build such an extraction system from the ground up.  We collect and categorize more than 220 popular handcrafted features grounded on past literature. Then, we conduct a correlation analysis study on several task-specific datasets and report the potential use cases of each feature. Lastly, we devise a multilingual handcrafted linguistic feature extraction system in a systematically expandable manner. We open-source our system",

    "translated_abstract": "过去的研究已经鉴定出了一组丰富的手工语言特征，可以潜在地帮助各种任务。但是，由于这些特征数量庞大，因此难以有效地选择和利用现有的手工特征。加上在研究工作中实现不一致的问题，目前还不存在分类方案或者统一接受的特征名称，这造成了不必要的混乱。此外，大多数现有的手工特征提取库都不是开源的，或者没有得到积极的维护。因此，研究人员经常需要从零开始构建这样的提取系统。我们通过过去的文献收集和分类了超过220个受欢迎的手工特征。然后，我们在几个任务特定的数据集上进行了相关性分析研究，并报告了每个特征的潜在用途。最后，我们设计了一个多语言的手工语言特征提取系统，以系统性的可扩展方式实现。我们开源了我们的系统。",
