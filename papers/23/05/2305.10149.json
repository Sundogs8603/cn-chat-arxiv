To address this, we propose to decouple knowledge retrieval from response generation and introduce a multi-grained knowledge retriever (MAKER) that includes an entity selector to search for relevant entities and an attribute selector to filter out irrelevant attributes.

    "translated_abstract": "从外部数据库中检索出合适的领域知识是生成信息响应的任务导向型端到端对话系统的核心。大多数现有的系统将知识检索与响应生成混合在一起，并通过引用响应直接监督优化，导致当知识库变得大规模时，检索表现不佳。为了解决这个问题，我们提出将知识检索从响应生成中解耦，并引入多粒度知识检索器（MAKER），其中包括实体选择器以搜索相关实体和属性选择器以过滤不相关属性。为了训练检索器，我们提出了一种新的蒸馏目标，从响应生成器中提取监督信号。在三个标准基准测试中进行的实验证明，我们的检索器比现有方法更有效地执行知识检索，且适用于小规模和大规模知识库。我们的代码已发布在https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Research/tree/master/NLP/End-to-End%20Conversation%20Model%20(MAKER)。",
