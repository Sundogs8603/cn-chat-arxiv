    "abstract": "Studies in bias and fairness in natural language processing have primarily examined social biases within a single language and/or across few attributes (e.g. gender, race). However, biases can manifest differently across various languages for individual attributes. As a result, it is critical to examine biases within each language and attribute. Of equal importance is to study how these biases compare across languages and how the biases are affected when training a model on multilingual data versus monolingual data. We present a bias analysis across Italian, Chinese, English, Hebrew, and Spanish on the downstream sentiment analysis task to observe whether specific demographics are viewed more positively. We study bias similarities and differences across these languages and investigate the impact of multilingual vs. monolingual training data. We adapt existing sentiment bias templates in English to Italian, Chinese, Hebrew, and Spanish for four attributes: race, religion, nationality, a",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理中有关偏见和公平的研究主要考察单个语言内和/或跨少数属性（如性别，种族）的社会偏见。然而，对于单个属性，偏见可能在各种语言中表现出不同的方式。因此，有必要检查每种语言和属性内部的偏见。同样重要的是研究这些偏见在语言之间的差异以及在多语言数据和单语言数据上训练模型时这些偏见的影响。我们在意大利语、中文、英语、希伯来语和西班牙语之间对下游情感分析任务进行了偏见分析，以观察特定人口群体是否被更积极地看待。我们研究了这些语言之间的偏见相似性和差异，并调查了多语言与单语言训练数据的影响。我们将现有的英文情感偏见模板适应到意大利语、中文、希伯来语和西班牙语中，包括四个属性：种族、宗教、国籍和性别。",
