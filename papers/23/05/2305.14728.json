    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度语言表示已成为语言特征化的主要形式，但在许多情况下，了解模型的决策过程是很重要的。这不仅需要一个可解释的模型，还需要可解释的特征。特别是，语言必须以可解释的方式特征化，同时仍然很好地描述原始文本。我们提出了SenteCon，一种在深度语言表示中引入人类可解释性的方法。给定一个文本段落，SenteCon将文本编码为可解释类别的层，其中每个维度对应于特定类别的相关性。我们的实证评估表明，使用SenteCon对语言进行编码可以在对下游任务的预测性能几乎没有成本的情况下提供高级可解释性。此外，我们发现，在下游性能和协议方面，SenteCon优于现有的可解释语言表示。",
