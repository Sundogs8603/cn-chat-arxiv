    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，以词级别的类比为形式的类比在衡量诸如word2vec之类的词嵌入方法的质量方面发挥了重要作用。然而，现代的大型语言模型(LLMs)主要根据GLUE和SuperGLUE等基准的外在量度进行评估，而在LLMs是否能够在长文本中绘制类比的方面，只有少数几项研究。本文介绍了一种名为“ANALOGICAL”的新型基准，以六个复杂级别的长文本类比分类对LLMs进行内在评估，分别为 (i)单词、(ii)单词vs句子、(iii)语法、(iv)否定、(v)蕴含和(vi)隐喻。利用13个数据集和三种不同的距离度量方法，我们评估了8个LLMs在语义向量空间中识别类比对的能力(例如，“我能说两种语言”应该更接近“我是双语的”，而“我喜欢巧克力”和“我不喜欢巧克力”应该是正交的)。",
