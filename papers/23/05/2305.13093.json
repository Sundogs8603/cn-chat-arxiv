In this paper, we introduce the Restore Anything Pipeline (RAP), a novel interactive and per-object level image restoration approach that incorporates a controllable model to generate different results that users may choose from. RAP incorporates image segmentation through the recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a controllable image restoration model to create a user-friendly pipeline for several image restoration tasks.
