    "translated_abstract": "本文针对低延迟、顺序视频压缩下受到均方误差（MSE）失真损失和感知损失（以实现真实感为目标）的输出设计了研究，并考虑了两种不同的感知损失函数（PLFs），分别是PLF-JD和PLF-FMD。通过信息论分析和基于深度学习的实验，我们演示了 PLF 的选择可能对重建效果产生显著影响，特别是在低比特率的情况下。具体而言，在保留跨帧时序相关性方面，基于PLF-JD 的重建效果会更好，但与 PLF-FMD 相比，也会带来更大的失真惩罚，并使其更难以恢复早期输出帧中出现的错误。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了在学习视频压缩时，感知损失函数的选择对于重建效果的影响，发现选择 PLF-JD 可以更好地保留跨帧时序相关性，但同时会带来更大的失真惩罚和更难以纠正早期输出帧中的错误。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the impact of choosing perception loss functions (PLFs) on reconstruction in learned video compression, finding that while using PLF-JD can better maintain temporal correlation across frames, it also results in more distortion and makes it harder to correct errors in earlier output frames compared to PLF-FMD."
