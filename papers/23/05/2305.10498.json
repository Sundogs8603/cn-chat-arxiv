    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）已成为建模关系数据的事实标准工具。然而，尽管许多真实世界的图是有向的，但今天大多数GNN模型都通过使图成为无向图来完全忽略这些信息。这样做的原因是历史性的：1）许多早期的谱GNN变体明确要求图是无向的，2）关于同类图的第一批基准测试并未发现使用方向性有明显的增益。在本文中，我们展示了在异类设置中，将图形视为有向图可以增加图的内在同质性，这表明了从正确使用方向性信息中可能得到的好处。为此，我们引入了Directed Graph Neural Network（Dir-GNN），这是一个新的面向有向图的深度学习通用框架。Dir-GNN可以用于扩展任何消息传递神经网络（MPNN），以通过对每个节点执行单独的进出消息聚合来考虑边方向性信息。我们在有向引用图上评估了Dir-GNN，并证明它在预测缺失的引用链接方面优于现有的无向GNN和一些有向图模型。我们的结果表明，方向性信息可以提高在异质图上的学习能力，Dir-GNN可以有效地利用这些信息。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a novel directed graph neural network framework, Dir-GNN, which outperforms existing undirected GNNs and some directed graph models in predicting missing citation links on directed citation graphs. The results suggest that directionality information can improve learning on heterophilic graphs and Dir-GNN effectively leverages this information."
