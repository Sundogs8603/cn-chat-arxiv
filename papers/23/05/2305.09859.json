    "translated_abstract": "随着流畅的生成语言模型的出现，它们可以生成与人类写作的非常相似的令人信服的话语，因此区分一段文本是由机器生成的还是人类写作的变得更加具有挑战性和重要性，因为这样的模型可以用于传播错误信息、虚假新闻、虚假评论并模仿某些作者和人物。为此，已经提出了许多检测机器生成文本的方法。其中大部分方法需要访问目标模型的 logits，或需要可以从目标模型中进行采样的能力。其中一种黑匣子检测方法依赖于观察到生成文本在生成器的似然函数下是局部最优的，而人类写作的文本则不是。我们发现，总体而言，较小且部分训练的模型更适合作为通用文本检测器：它们可以更精确地检测来自小型和大型模型的生成文本。有趣的是，我们发现检测器和生成模型是否具有相同的架构或相同的语料库对检测性能没有显著影响。",
