    "translated_abstract": "自动事实验证近年来受到了广泛关注。当今的自动事实核查系统主要集中于使用数字评分来估计真实性，而这些评分往往无法被人类理解。而人类核查员通常会按照一些逻辑步骤来验证一个类似真实的主张，并得出其真实性还是虚假性的结论。因此，需要一种基于方面（区分哪些部分是真实的，哪些是虚假的）的可解释系统，可以协助人类核查员针对事实提出相关问题，然后分别验证以得出最终结论。本文中，我们提出了一个5W框架（谁、什么、何时、何地和为什么）用于问题回答式的事实可解释性，并提供了一个半自动产生的数据集FACTIFY-5WQA，该数据集包含39个方面，每个方面都对应某个问题和它的答案，以及是否可验证。我们提出了一个模型，它融合了双向长短时记忆网络和多头自注意力机制，用于执行5WQA任务。我们还提供了一个公共基准测试集进行评测和比较。实验结果表明，我们的模型在多个指标上都超过了其他现有的基线模型和常规事实验证系统，这证明了我们的方法的有效性和可行性。",
