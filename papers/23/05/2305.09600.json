    "translated_abstract": "在道路网络中，交通事故和其他事件，如果不加以缓解，可能会导致级联故障，影响系统的大部分功能。及时处理这种极端拥堵情况是降低排放量、提高生产率和改善城市生活质量的必要手段。本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的方法，在繁忙的多车道高速公路上减少交通拥堵。该智能体被训练学习适应性绕行策略，以便在拥堵的高速公路交通中最优地利用高速公路车道和周边局部收发路网，奖励是减少拥堵及提高车速。实验设置在美国华盛顿州Shoreline市的一段长2.6英里、4条车道的高速公路中进行，在微观和连续的综合交通模拟器SUMO（城市移动仿真）中模拟了两个出口和相关的收发路，同时使用了参数化的转移学习。研究结果表明，所提出的方法可以显著提高极端拥堵时的道路收发效率并减少总通行时间。",

By learning adaptive detouring strategies, the proposed method optimizes the usage of freeway lanes and the local arterial network, resulting in congestion reduction and traffic speed improvement. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the efficiency of arterial usage during extreme congestion and reduces overall travel time."
