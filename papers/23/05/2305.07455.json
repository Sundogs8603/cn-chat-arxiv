    "translated_abstract": "大多数语音翻译模型都严重依赖于平行语料库，对于低资源语言而言，收集这种数据非常困难。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于级联的语音翻译系统，不依赖于任何配对数据。我们使用完全非配对的数据来训练我们的无监督系统，并在 CoVoST 2 和 CVSS 上进行了评估。结果表明，在某些语言对上，我们的方法与其他一些早期监督方法相当。尽管级联系统总是存在严重的误差传播问题，但我们提出了去噪反向翻译（DBT）这种新颖的方法来构建健壮的无监督神经机器翻译（UNMT）系统。DBT成功提高了所有三个翻译方向的 BLEU 得分0.7-0.9。此外，我们简化了级联系统的流程，以降低推理延迟，并对我们工作的每个部分进行了全面的分析。我们还在EST上展示了我们的无监督语音翻译结果。",
