    "translated_abstract": "到目前为止，大多数文本简化工作都集中在句子级输入上。早期的文件简化尝试仅通过迭代文档中的句子来应用这些方法。然而，这无法连贯地保持话语结构，导致输出质量不佳。最近，控制简化的策略已被利用为了在生成文档级计划（句子级简化操作序列）之后，在下游使用该计划来引导句子级简化，从而实现了文档简化的最新成果。然而，这仍然具有局限性，因为简化模型没有直接访问局部的跨句子文档上下文，很可能会对表面实现产生负面影响。我们探索了多种使用文件上下文在简化过程中的系统，通过迭代更大的文本单元或通过扩展系统架构来关注文档的高级话语表示。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper discusses how to use contextual information in document simplification to improve the quality of the output. By iterating over larger text units or extending the system architecture to focus on the high-level discourse representation of the document, the simplification model can directly access the local inter-sentence document context, resulting in state-of-the-art document simplification."
