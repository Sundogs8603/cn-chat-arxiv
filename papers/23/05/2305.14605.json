    "abstract": "This article reviews recent advances in addressing empirical identification issues in cross-country and country-level studies and their implications for the identification of the effectiveness and consequences of economic sanctions. I argue that, given the difficulties in assessing causal relationships in cross-national data, country-level case studies can serve as a useful and informative complement to cross-national regression studies. However, I also warn that case studies pose a set of additional potential empirical pitfalls which can obfuscate rather than clarify the identification of causal mechanisms at work. Therefore, the most sensible way to read case study evidence is as a complement rather than as a substitute to cross-national research.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文回顾了近期在跨国和国家层面研究中解决实证鉴别问题的最新进展及其对经济制裁效果和后果鉴别的影响。作者认为，在评估跨国数据的因果关系方面存在困难的情况下，国家层面的案例研究可以作为跨国回归研究的有用和信息性补充。但作者也警告，案例研究存在一系列潜在的实证陷阱，可能让因果机制的识别变得模糊，而不是更加清晰明了。因此，阅读案例研究证据的最明智的方法是将其视为跨国研究的补充，而非替代。",
