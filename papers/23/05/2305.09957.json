    "translated_abstract": "众所周知，从独立同分布的先验条件开始初始化的人工神经网络在隐藏层神经元数目足够大的极限下收敛到高斯过程。本文证明了量子神经网络（QNNs）也存在类似的结果。特别地，我们证明了基于Haar随机酉或正交深QNNs的某些模型的输出在希尔伯特空间维度$d$足够大时会收敛于高斯过程。由于输入状态、测量的可观测量以及酉矩阵的元素不独立等因素的作用，本文对这一结果的推导比经典情形更加微妙。我们分析的一个重要后果是，这个结果得到的高斯过程不能通过贝叶斯统计学来有效地预测QNN的输出。此外，我们的定理表明，Haar随机QNNs中的测量现象比以前认为的要更严重，我们证明了演员的集中现象。",
