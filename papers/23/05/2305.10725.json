In the case of sectorial transition operators, hence, for symmetric L\\'evy models, the proof is straightforward. In the case of non-symmetric L\\'evy models, we construct a non-linear deformation of the dual space, which makes the transition operator sectorial, with an arbitrary small opening angle, and justify the new realization.

    "translated_abstract": "我们推导出逆$Z$-变换新的高效数值实现适用的多组充分条件。对于大的$n$，新方案的复杂度比梯形法则的复杂度小数十倍。作为应用，我们考虑欧式期权和离散监测单障碍期权的定价；概述了在具有障碍回溯特征的更一般期权上的应用。在扇形转移算符的情况下，即对于对称Lévy模型，证明是直截了当的。对于非对称Lévy模型，我们构造了一个对偶空间的非线性变形，使得转移算符扇形化，开口角度任意小，并证明了新实现方法。我们施加的条件对于广泛类别的非对称Stieltjes-Lévy过程都成立。",
