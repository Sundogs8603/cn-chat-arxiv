Even if scattered waves are visualized, inspectors still need to carefully inspect the images. To automate this, this paper proposes a deep neural network for automatic defect detection and localization in LUVT images. To explore the structure of a neural network suitable to this task, we compared the LUVT image analysis problem with the generic object detection problem. Numerical experiments using real-world data from a SUS304 flat plate showed that the proposed method is more effective than the general object detection model in terms of prediction performance. We also show that the computational time required for prediction is faster than that of the general object detection model.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，超声无损检测的重要性不断增加。将激光超声检测与散波可视化技术相结合的激光超声可视化测试具有潜在的应用前景。然而，即使散波被可视化，检验员仍需要仔细检查图像。为了实现自动化，本文提出了一种用于LUVT图像中的自动缺陷检测和定位的深度神经网络。我们将LUVT图像分析问题与通用对象检测问题进行比较，以探索适合该任务的神经网络结构。使用来自SUS304平板的实际数据进行的数值实验表明，该方法在预测性能方面比通用对象检测模型更有效。我们还表明，所需的预测计算时间比通用对象检测模型更快。",
