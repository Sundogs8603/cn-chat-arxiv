    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs，例如ChatGPT）在命名实体识别（NER）中展现出了令人印象深刻的零/小样本能力。然而，这些模型只能通过在线API访问，这可能会导致数据泄漏和无法重现的问题。本文提出了基于新发布的开源LLM--Vicuna的零/小样本NER框架VicunaNER。VicunaNER是一个两阶段框架，其中每个阶段利用多轮与Vicuna的对话从文本中识别实体。我们将第二阶段命名为重新识别，它识别第一阶段（即识别）中未识别的实体。此外，我们在每个阶段设置实体正确性检查对话框以过滤错误实体。我们在涉及5个领域的10个数据集上评估了VicunaNER的零样本能力和Few-NERD的小样本能力。实验结果表明，VicunaNER在两种情况下均取得了优越的性能。此外，我们对VicunaNER进行了全面的研究。",
