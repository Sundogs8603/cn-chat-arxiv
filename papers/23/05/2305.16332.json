    "translated_abstract": "为了在动态的实际环境中长期部署辅助机器人，机器人必须继续学习和适应其环境。研究人员已经开发了各种连续学习（CL）的计算模型，可以使机器人不断从有限的训练数据中学习，并避免遗忘先前的知识。虽然这些CL模型可以缓解静态、系统地收集的数据集上的遗忘，但人们目前尚不清楚在多次交互中连续学习的机器人是如何被人类用户所感知的。在本研究中，我们开发了一个系统，将目标识别的CL模型与Fetch移动操纵机器人进行整合，并允许人类参与者在多个会话中直接教授和测试机器人。我们开展了一项现场研究，60名参与者在300个会话中与我们的系统互动（每个参与者5次会话）。我们进行了一项两组实验的研究，并使用三种不同的CL模型（三个实验条件）来了解人类对连续学习机器人的看法。",
    "tldr": "本研究结合机器人和连续学习模型，通过人机交互的方式与60名参与者实验，结果表明使用连续学习可以提高机器人的能力，参与者更倾向于与其进行反复交互，并提供更多的反馈信息。",
