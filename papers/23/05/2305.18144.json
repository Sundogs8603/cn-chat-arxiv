    "translated_abstract": "通过利用从大型段落语料库检索到的段落来提供合适的答案，检索增强的文本生成在知识密集型语言任务上取得了显著进展，如开放域问答和知识增强对话生成。然而，由于检索和生成之间存在差异，即在检索过程中候选段落都被等同对待而不考虑它们生成合适答案的潜力，因此检索到的段落并不理想用于指导答案生成。为了解决这个挑战，本文提出了GeneRative Knowledge Improved Passage Ranking (GripRank) 方法，通过将生成式段落估计器(GPE)的知识提炼到一个段落排序器中，其中GPE是用于衡量生成合适答案的可能性的生成式语言模型。",
