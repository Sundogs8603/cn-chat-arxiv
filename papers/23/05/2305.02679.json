    "abstract": "Word-level saliency explanations (\"heat maps over words\") are often used to communicate feature-attribution in text-based models. Recent studies found that superficial factors such as word length can distort human interpretation of the communicated saliency scores. We conduct a user study to investigate how the marking of a word's neighboring words affect the explainee's perception of the word's importance in the context of a saliency explanation. We find that neighboring words have significant effects on the word's importance rating. Concretely, we identify that the influence changes based on neighboring direction (left vs. right) and a-priori linguistic and computational measures of phrases and collocations (vs. unrelated neighboring words). Our results question whether text-based saliency explanations should be continued to be communicated at word level, and inform future research on alternative saliency explanation methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "单词级别的显著性解释（“单词热图”）经常用于在基于文本的模型中传达特征归因。最近的研究发现，诸如单词长度等表面因素可能会扭曲传达的显著性评分的人类解读。我们进行了一项用户研究，以研究一个单词的相邻单词的标记如何影响解释者对显著性解释中单词的重要性的感知。我们发现相邻单词对单词的重要性评分有显著影响。具体来说，我们确定了影响基于相邻方向（左侧与右侧）以及短语和搭配的先验语言和计算度量值（与不相关的相邻单词）。我们的结果让人质疑在文本为基础的显著性解释是否应该继续在单词级别上进行传达，并为替代显著性解释方法的未来研究提供信息。",
