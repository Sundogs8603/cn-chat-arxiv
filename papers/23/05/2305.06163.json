    "translated_abstract": "在回答开放式数学问题时自动反馈具有显著的潜力来提高大规模学习成果。自动反馈系统的关键部分是错误分类组件，该组件识别学生的错误，并启用适当的预定义反馈。大多数现有的错误分类方法使用基于规则的方法，其泛化能力有限。现有的数据驱动方法避免了这些限制，但具体要求将学生答复中的数学表达式解析为语法树。这一要求本身就是一个限制，因为学生的答复并不总是符合语法的，无法转换为树形结构。在这项工作中，我们介绍一种使用预训练的大型语言模型进行错误分类的灵活方法。我们证明我们的方法可以在代数错误分类方面优于现有方法，并能够对更大的学生回答进行分类。此外，我们还展示了我们的方法可以推广到其他领域和语言，而无需额外的训练数据。",
