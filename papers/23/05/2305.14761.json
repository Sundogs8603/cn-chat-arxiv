    "abstract": "Charts are very popular for analyzing data, visualizing key insights and answering complex reasoning questions about data. To facilitate chart-based data analysis using natural language, several downstream tasks have been introduced recently such as chart question answering and chart summarization. However, most of the methods that solve these tasks use pretraining on language or vision-language tasks that do not attempt to explicitly model the structure of the charts (e.g., how data is visually encoded and how chart elements are related to each other). To address this, we first build a large corpus of charts covering a wide variety of topics and visual styles. We then present UniChart, a pretrained model for chart comprehension and reasoning. UniChart encodes the relevant text, data, and visual elements of charts and then uses a chart-grounded text decoder to generate the expected output in natural language. We propose several chart-specific pretraining tasks that include: (i) low-lev",

    "translated_abstract": "图表在数据分析、可视化重要见解和回答数据的复杂推理问题方面非常流行。为了方便使用自然语言进行基于图表的数据分析，最近引入了几个下游任务，例如图表问答和图表总结。然而，大多数解决这些任务的方法都使用语言或视觉-语言任务的预训练，而不试图明确建模图表的结构（例如，如何视觉编码数据以及如何将图表元素相互关联）。为了解决这个问题，我们首先建立了一个包括各种不同主题和视觉风格的大量图表语料库。然后，我们提出了UniChart，这是一个用于图表理解和推理的预训练模型。UniChart对图表的相关文本、数据和视觉元素进行编码，然后使用基于图表的文本解码器以自然语言生成预期的输出。我们提出了几个面向图表的预训练任务，包括：（i）低层次视觉编码预测，（ii）图表元素关系预测和（iii）图表问题回答预测。我们的评估显示，UniChart在几个图表理解和推理任务上表现优于强基线。",
