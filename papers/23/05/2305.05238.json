    "translated_abstract": "目前，量子处理器（QPUs）仅由云供应商提供。然而，随着近期的进展，到处都可以很快地托管QPUs。现有工作尚未借鉴边缘计算研究，探索利用移动QPUs的系统，或者分布式异构资源如何使混合应用程序受益。因此，本文提出了边缘-云连续体中量子计算的架构。我们讨论了延伸现有经典边缘计算工作以整合QPUs的必要性、挑战和解决方法。我们描述了如何通过热启动来定义利用分布在连续体各处的分层资源的工作流程。然后，我们介绍了带有混合经典-量子神经网络（QNNs）的分布式推理引擎，以帮助系统设计人员适应具有复杂要求且产生最高异质度的应用程序。我们提出了解决方案，重点关注分布式环境中的经典层分区和QPU分配，考虑了系统的物理限制。",
