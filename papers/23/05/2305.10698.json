    "abstract": "There have thousands of crimes are happening daily all around. But people keep statistics only few of them, therefore crime rates are increasing day by day. The reason behind can be less concern or less statistics of previous crimes. It is much more important to observe the previous crime statistics for general people to make their outing decision and police for catching the criminals are taking steps to restrain the crimes and tourists to make their travelling decision. National institute of justice releases crime survey data for the country, but does not offer crime statistics up to Union or Thana level. Considering all of these cases we have come up with an approach which can give an approximation to people about the safety of a specific location with crime ranking of different areas locating the crimes on a map including a future crime occurrence prediction mechanism. Our approach relies on different online Bangla newspapers for crawling the crime data, stemming and keyword extract",
