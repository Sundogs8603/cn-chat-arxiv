    "translated_abstract": "众所周知，使用平方损失的经验风险最小化可能会达到极小的最大失误率。本文的关键信息是，在温和的假设下，ERM的次优性必须归因于大的偏差而非方差。在ERM的平方误差的偏差-方差分解中，方差项必然具有极小的失误率。我们为固定设计提供了一个简单的、使用概率方法证明这一事实的证明。然后，我们在随机设计设置下为各种模型证明了这一结果。此外，我们提供了 Chatterjee 不可允许性定理 (Chatterjee, 2014, Theorem 1.4) 的简单证明，该定理指出，在固定设计设置中，ERM不能被排除为一种最优方法，并将该结果扩展到随机设计设置。我们还表明，我们的估计表明ERM的稳定性，为Caponnetto和Rakhlin(2006)的非Donsker类的主要结果提供了补充。",
