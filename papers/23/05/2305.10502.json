    "abstract": "Recently Transformer and Convolution neural network (CNN) based models have shown promising results in EEG signal processing. Transformer models can capture the global dependencies in EEG signals through a self-attention mechanism, while CNN models can capture local features such as sawtooth waves. In this work, we propose an end-to-end neural epilepsy detection model, EENED, that combines CNN and Transformer. Specifically, by introducing the convolution module into the Transformer encoder, EENED can learn the time-dependent relationship of the patient's EEG signal features and notice local EEG abnormal mutations closely related to epilepsy, such as the appearance of spikes and the sprinkling of sharp and slow waves. Our proposed framework combines the ability of Transformer and CNN to capture different scale features of EEG signals and holds promise for improving the accuracy and reliability of epilepsy detection. Our source code will be released soon on GitHub.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，在EEG信号处理中，基于变压器（Transformer）和卷积神经网络（CNN）的模型表现出了很好的结果。变压器模型可以通过自我注意机制捕捉EEG信号的全局依赖性，而CNN模型可以捕捉如锯齿波之类的局部特征。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为EENED的端到端神经元癫痫检测模型，它结合了CNN和Transformer。具体地，通过在Transformer编码器中引入卷积模块，EENED可以学习患者EEG信号特征的时间依赖关系，并注意到与癫痫密切相关的局部EEG异常突变，如尖锐波的出现和缓慢波的散布。我们提出的框架结合了Transformer和CNN捕捉EEG信号不同尺度的特征的能力，有望提高癫痫检测的准确性和可靠性。我们的源代码将很快在GitHub上发布。",
