    "translated_abstract": "灾难摘要方法提供了有关社交媒体平台上发生的灾难事件的重要信息的概述，例如 Twitter。然而，发布的信息类型根据地点、类型、严重程度等多种因素在灾难中显著变化。由于缺乏良好的数据集谱，加之缺乏基准摘要的可用性，现有的基于人工标注的基准摘要生成方法（提取式摘要的基准摘要）仍然存在两个问题：依赖于标注者的智慧和直觉，并且需要大量的人力和时间。因此，为了解决这些挑战，本文提出了一种名为PORTRAIT的混合框架，该框架使用智能算法和人工智能来创建灾难事件的基准摘要。我们的提出的框架显著降低了标注者的人力，同时实现了更可靠的基准摘要生成过程。",
