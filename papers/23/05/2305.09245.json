    "translated_abstract": "学习增强的算法受到越来越多的关注，但最近才在可探索不确定性的环境中被考虑，其中可以通过查询获得不确定输入元素的精确值，并且目标是最小化解决问题所需的查询数量。我们研究了在利用不可信预测的情况下排序和超图定向的学习增强算法。我们的算法提供了提高了准确预测的性能保证，同时保持了在没有预测的情况下最好的最坏情况保证。对于超图定向，对于任何$\\gamma\\geq 2$，我们提供一个算法，该算法在正确预测时达到$1+1/\\gamma$的竞争比，对于任意错误预测则为$\\gamma$。对于排序，我们在准确预测时实现了最优解，同时在任意错误预测时仍是$2$竞争的。这些权衡是在实现非平凡保证的同时实现的最佳可能权衡。",
