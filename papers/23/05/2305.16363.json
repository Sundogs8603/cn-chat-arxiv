    "abstract": "Electronic health records (EHR) often contain different rates of representation of certain subpopulations (SP). Factors like patient demographics, clinical condition prevalence, and medical center type contribute to this underrepresentation. Consequently, when training machine learning models on such datasets, the models struggle to generalize well and perform poorly on underrepresented SPs. To address this issue, we propose a novel ensemble framework that utilizes generative models. Specifically, we train a GAN-based synthetic data generator for each SP and incorporate synthetic samples into each SP training set. Ultimately, we train SP-specific prediction models. To properly evaluate this method, we design an evaluation pipeline with 2 real-world use case datasets, queried from the MIMIC database. Our approach shows increased model performance over underrepresented SPs. Our code and models are given as supplementary and will be made available on a public repository.",

    "translated_abstract": "电子病历（EHR）通常包含某些亚群体（SP）的不同比例表示。患者的人口统计学、临床情况的流行程度和医疗中心类型等因素导致这种不充分的代表性。因此，当在这种数据集上训练机器学习模型时，模型很难进行良好的概括并在代表不足的SP上表现不佳。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种利用生成模型的新型集成框架。具体来说，我们为每个SP训练一个基于GAN的合成数据生成器，并将合成样本纳入每个SP的训练集中。最终，我们训练SP特定的预测模型。为了正确评估该方法，我们设计了一个评估流程，并使用从MIMIC数据库查询的两个真实用例数据集。我们的方法显示出在代表不足的SP上增加了模型的性能。我们的代码和模型将作为补充材料提供，并将在公共存储库上提供。",
