    "abstract": "The focus is on critical problems in NLP related to linguistic diversity and variation across the African continent, specifically with regards to African local di- alects and Arabic dialects that have received little attention. We evaluated our various approaches, demonstrating their effectiveness while highlighting the potential impact of the proposed approach on businesses seeking to improve customer experience and product development in African local dialects. The idea of using the model as a teaching tool for product-based instruction is interesting, as it could potentially stimulate interest in learners and trigger techno entrepreneurship. Overall, our modified approach offers a promising analysis of the challenges of dealing with African local dialects. Particularly Arabic dialects, which could have a significant impact on businesses seeking to improve customer experience and product development.",
