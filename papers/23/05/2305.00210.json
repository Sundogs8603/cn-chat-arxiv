We trained ShipHullGAN on a large dataset of 52,591 \\textit{physically validated} designs from a wide range of existing ship types, including container ships, tankers, bulk carriers, tugboats, and crew supply vessels. We developed a new shape extraction and representation strategy to convert all training designs into a common geometric representation of the same resolution, as typically GANs can only accept vectors of fixed dimension as input.
