    "abstract": "Poverty maps derived from satellite imagery are increasingly used to inform high-stakes policy decisions, such as the allocation of humanitarian aid and the distribution of government resources. Such poverty maps are typically constructed by training machine learning algorithms on a relatively modest amount of ``ground truth\" data from surveys, and then predicting poverty levels in areas where imagery exists but surveys do not. Using survey and satellite data from ten countries, this paper investigates disparities in representation, systematic biases in prediction errors, and fairness concerns in satellite-based poverty mapping across urban and rural lines, and shows how these phenomena affect the validity of policies based on predicted maps. Our findings highlight the importance of careful error and bias analysis before using satellite-based poverty maps in real-world policy decisions.",

    "translated_abstract": "卫星图像衍生的贫困地图越来越多地被用来决定分配人道主义援助和政府资源等高风险政策问题。这些贫困地图通常通过使用相对较少的调查“地面真实性”数据训练机器学习算法，然后预测在存在图像但无调查的区域的贫困水平来构建的。本文利用十个国家的调查和卫星数据，研究了城乡基于卫星的贫困映射中的代表性差异，预测误差中的系统偏差和公平性问题，并展示了这些现象如何影响基于预测地图的政策的有效性。我们的发现强调了在将卫星衍生的贫困地图用于现实政策决策前进行仔细的误差和偏差分析的重要性。",
