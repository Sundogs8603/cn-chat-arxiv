    "translated_abstract": "计算分子系统的性质需要估计（未归一化的）玻尔兹曼分布的期望值。分子动力学（MD）是一种广泛采用的技术，用于近似这种量。然而，稳定的模拟需要非常小的积分时间步长（$10^{-15}$秒），而一些矩的收敛性，例如结合自由能或速率，可能依赖于长达$10^{-1}$秒的时间尺度上的采样过程，并且必须对每个分子系统进行独立模拟。在这里，我们提出了隐式转移算子（ITO）学习，这是一个学习具有多个时间分辨率的模拟过程代理的框架。我们使用具有新SE（3）等变体系结构的去噪扩散概率模型实现ITO，并展示结果模型可以在多个时间尺度上生成自洽的随机动力学，即使只有部分观测到系统。最后，我们提出了粗粒化的CG-SE3-ITO模型，并展示它可以在模拟过程中节省数百倍的时间。",
