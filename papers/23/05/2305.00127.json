    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在物联网驱动的孤立微电网中，如何通过深度强化学习来进行柴油发电机组的调度问题。在可再生能源和负载需求不确定性下，充分利用可再生能源。通过学习并建立历史可再生资源和负载数据的最优策略模型，以便从先前小时内相应传感器接收到的过去可再生能源和负载数据的观测中生成实时决策。目标在于确保供需平衡的前提下减少操作成本。具体来说，我们构建了一个新的有限视界下马当前过程模型（POMDP），其中考虑了旋转备用。为了克服由于二进制发电机组开关决策和连续辐射（ED）决策的离散-连续混合作用空间的挑战，提出了一种混合动作有限视角RDPG（HAFH-RDPG）的DRL算法。",
