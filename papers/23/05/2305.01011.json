    "abstract": "In this era of information explosion, deceivers use different domains or mediums of information to exploit the users, such as News, Emails, and Tweets. Although numerous research has been done to detect deception in all these domains, information shortage in a new event necessitates these domains to associate with each other to battle deception. To form this association, we propose a feature augmentation method by harnessing the intermediate layer representation of neural models. Our approaches provide an improvement over the self-domain baseline models by up to 6.60%. We find Tweets to be the most helpful information provider for Fake News and Phishing Email detection, whereas News helps most in Tweet Rumor detection. Our analysis provides a useful insight for domain knowledge transfer which can help build a stronger deception detection system than the existing literature.",

    "translated_abstract": "在信息爆炸的这个时代，欺骗者利用不同的信息领域或媒介来利用用户，比如新闻、电子邮件和推文等。尽管已经进行了大量的研究来检测这些领域中的欺骗，但新事件中信息的短缺需要这些领域相互关联来对抗欺骗。为了形成这种关联，我们提出了一种通过利用神经模型的中间层表示进行特征增强的方法。我们的方法比自身领域基线模型提高了多达6.60%的准确率。我们发现推文是检测假新闻和钓鱼电子邮件最有帮助的信息提供者，而新闻在推特谣言检测中最有帮助。我们的分析提供了对于域知识转移的有用洞见，可以帮助建立比现有文献更强大的欺骗检测系统。",

The analysis shows that tweets are the most helpful information providers for detecting fake news and phishing emails, while news is most helpful for detecting tweet rumors."
