    "translated_abstract": "光体积描记法 (PPG) 是使用光测量血液体积的变化的一种方法，是大多数可穿戴设备的特征。PPG信号能够提供对人体循环系统的洞察，并可用于提取各种生物特征，例如心率和血管老化。尽管已经提出了几种算法，但许多算法存在限制，包括过多地依赖人工校准、高信号质量要求和缺乏泛化能力。在本文中，我们引入了一种结合了图论和计算机视觉算法的PPG信号处理框架，该框架对振幅无关并且对仿射变换不变。它还需要最少的预处理，通过RGB通道融合信息，并在任务和数据集上展现了稳健的泛化能力。所提出的VGTL-net在血管老化预测方面实现了最先进的性能，并展示了稳健的估计能力。",
