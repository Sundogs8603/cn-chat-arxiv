    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了第一个数据集 \\dataset，用于从邮件串中执行事件抽取。为此，我们首先提出了一个新的分类法，涵盖了邮件领域中的 10 种事件类型和 76 个参数。我们的最终数据集包括约 4K 封标记有约 9K 个事件实例的邮件。为了了解任务的挑战，我们进行了一系列实验，比较了两种常见的事件抽取方法，即序列标记和生成式端到端抽取（包括几率 GPT-3.5）。我们的结果表明，邮件事件抽取任务远未得到解决，因为存在诸多难点，例如提取非连续共享触发器跨度、提取非命名实体参数和建模邮件会话历史等。因此，我们的工作提出了未来在这个特定领域的事件抽取任务中需要进行更多研究的建议。",
