    "abstract": "The local and global features are both essential for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Many recent methods have verified that simply combining local and global features can further promote ASR performance. However, these methods pay less attention to the interaction of local and global features, and their series architectures are rigid to reflect local and global relationships. To address these issues, this paper proposes InterFormer for interactive local and global features fusion to learn a better representation for ASR. Specifically, we combine the convolution block with the transformer block in a parallel design. Besides, we propose a bidirectional feature interaction module (BFIM) and a selective fusion module (SFM) to implement the interaction and fusion of local and global features, respectively. Extensive experiments on public ASR datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed InterFormer and its superior performance over the other Transformer and Conformer models.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于自动语音识别（ASR）而言，局部和全局特征都是必不可少的。许多最近的方法已经证实，简单地合并局部和全局特征可以进一步提高ASR性能。然而，这些方法往往忽略了局部和全局特征之间的交互，并且它们的串行架构无法反映局部和全局特征之间的关系。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了InterFormer，用于交互式局部和全局特征融合，以学习更好的ASR表示。具体而言，我们将卷积块与变形器块以并行设计相结合。此外，我们提出了双向特征交互模块（BFIM）和选择性融合模块（SFM）来实现局部和全局特征的交互和融合。在公共ASR数据集上的大量实验表明了我们提出的InterFormer的有效性，并且相对于其他Transformer和Conformer模型具有更出色的性能。",
