    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种在机器人状态和环境（障碍和地标位置）不确定性下进行安全运动规划的方法。为此，我们首先开发了一种方法，考虑机器人定位中的地标不确定性。现有的规划方法假定地标位置已经很好地知道，或者只有很小的不确定性。然而，这在实践中可能不成立。噪声传感器和不完美的运动使得来自环境特征估计的误差加剧。此外，环境中可能出现遮挡和动态物体，从而导致地标估计不准确。因此，不考虑这种不确定性可能会错误地定位机器人，导致低效的规划。我们的方法在贝叶斯滤波器估计框架中纳入了地标不确定性。我们还分析了考虑这种不确定性的影响，并勾勒了可以忽略它的情况。其次，我们通过对图搜索算法进行改进，引入了机器人动态感知的新视角来扩展最新技术的应用范围。",
