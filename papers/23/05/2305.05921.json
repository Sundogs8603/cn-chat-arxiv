    "abstract": "Commonsense fact verification, as a challenging branch of commonsense question-answering (QA), aims to verify through facts whether a given commonsense claim is correct or not. Answering commonsense questions necessitates a combination of knowledge from various levels. However, existing studies primarily rest on grasping either unstructured evidence or potential reasoning paths from structured knowledge bases, yet failing to exploit the benefits of heterogeneous knowledge simultaneously. In light of this, we propose Decker, a commonsense fact verification model that is capable of bridging heterogeneous knowledge by uncovering latent relationships between structured and unstructured knowledge. Experimental results on two commonsense fact verification benchmark datasets, CSQA2.0 and CREAK demonstrate the effectiveness of our Decker and further analysis verifies its capability to seize more precious information through reasoning.",

    "translated_abstract": "常识事实验证作为常识问答的一个具有挑战性的分支，旨在通过事实来验证一个给定的常识论断是否正确。回答常识问题需要从不同层次的知识中进行组合。然而，现有的研究主要依靠把握非结构化证据或从结构化知识库中找到潜在的推理路径，但没有同时利用异构知识的好处。鉴于此，我们提出了Decker，一种常识事实验证模型，能够通过发现结构化和非结构化知识之间的潜在关系来桥接异构知识。在两个常识事实验证基准数据集CSQA2.0和CREAK上的实验结果证明了我们Decker的有效性，进一步的分析验证了它在推理中获取更多珍贵信息的能力。",
