We further describe some initial results using pre-trained models on the named-entity recognition (NER) task on this novel dataset. We propose that our dataset of manually annotated abstracts now offers a Gold Standard Corpus for training future NER models in the automated extraction of host-pathogen detection methods from scientific publications, and further explain how our work makes first steps towards predicting the important human health-related concept of viral spillover risk automatically from the scientific literature.",
