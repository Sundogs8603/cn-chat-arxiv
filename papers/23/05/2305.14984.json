    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯推断通常需要单独运行可能昂贵的推理过程以获取每个新观测结果。相比之下，摊余的贝叶斯推断思想是最初在模拟数据上投资计算成本，然后可以用于快速执行推断（即返回后验分布估计）以获取新观测的结果。虽然在科学和工程中已经将这种方法应用于许多现实世界的模型，但其对于观测数据的对抗性扰动的稳健性尚不清楚。在这里，我们研究了摊余的贝叶斯推断的对抗性稳健性，重点关注多维后验分布的基于模拟的估计。我们展示了几个基准任务和一个来自医学成像的真实世界例子，表明几乎无法识别的有针对性的观察扰动会导致预测后验的巨大变化和高度不现实的后验预测样本。我们的结果表明，摊余的贝叶斯推断可能容易受到对抗性扰动的攻击，我们提出了一个简单的正则化方法，可以显著提高稳健性。",
