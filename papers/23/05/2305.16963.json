    "translated_abstract": "LiDAR（光探测与测距）已成为遥感工具箱中不可或缺的一部分，用于生物圈监测。特别是，LiDAR提供了以前所未有的准确度来绘制森林叶面积，而叶面积一直是影响植被与大气间气体交换模型的重要不确定性源。无人机（UAV）易于部署，因此可以频繁重访以跟踪植被对气候变化的响应。然而，装载在UAV上的微型传感器通常只提供有限密度的点云，而且由于逐渐增强的遮挡，从顶部到底部的密度呈现明显下降的趋势。在这种情况下，由于强烈的类别不平衡和空间上的不规则采样密度，将叶片点区分出来木材点面临着巨大挑战。在这里，我们介绍了一个基于Pointnet ++架构的神经网络模型",
