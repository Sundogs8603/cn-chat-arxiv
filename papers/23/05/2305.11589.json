    "abstract": "To achieve fully autonomous driving, vehicles must be capable of continuously performing various driving tasks, including lane keeping and car following, both of which are fundamental and well-studied driving ones. However, previous studies have mainly focused on individual tasks, and car following tasks have typically relied on complete leader-follower information to attain optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a vision-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent that can simultaneously perform lane keeping and car following maneuvers. To evaluate the performance of our DRL agent, we compare it with a baseline controller and use various performance metrics for quantitative analysis. Furthermore, we conduct a real-world evaluation to demonstrate the Sim2Real transfer capability of the trained DRL agent. To the best of our knowledge, our vision-based car following and lane keeping agent with Sim2Real transfer capability is the first of its kind.",

    "translated_abstract": "要实现完全自动驾驶，车辆必须能够持续执行各种驾驶任务，包括保持车道和跟车，这两个任务是基本的并且研究得很充分。然而，以前的研究主要集中在单个任务上，而跟车任务通常依赖完整的领导-跟随者信息来实现最佳性能。为解决这一限制，我们提出了一种基于视觉的深度强化学习（DRL）代理，可以同时执行保持车道和跟车操作。为了评估我们的DRL代理的性能，我们将其与基线控制器进行比较，并使用各种性能指标进行定量分析。此外，我们进行了现实世界的评估，以证明训练的DRL代理的Sim2Real转移能力。据我们所知，我们的基于视觉的保持车道和跟车代理及其Sim2Real转移能力是第一个这样的代理。",
