    "translated_abstract": "云对地球气候系统有着重要的影响，可以通过海洋云增白（Marine Cloud Brightening，MCB）等气候干预技术来调节地球辐射平衡和驱动区域性温度和降水变化。然而，为了避免 MCB 的意外影响，我们需要更好地理解复杂的云到气候响应函数。使用传统的地球系统模型来设计和测试这样的干预方案需要消耗大量计算资源。因此，我们提出了一种混合 AI 辅助可视化分析框架（HAiVA）来驱动这些科学研究，并促进不同 MCB 干预方案的交互式 what-if 探索，以评估它们对气候模式的预期和意外影响。我们与气候科学家团队合作，开发了一套混合 AI 模型来模拟基于历史观测和地球系统模型模拟的云-气候响应函数。HAiVA 将统计和机器学习模型与交互式数据可视化相结合，以探索云属性和气候模式之间的复杂相互作用，以及设计和测试 MCB 情景。",
