    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）因在保护数据隐私的同时更好地捕捉基础数据统计信息而成为分布式计算的有效学习范例。然而，在FL客户之间存在实际数据异构性的情况下，现有FL框架在捕捉展现不同分布的本地用户数据的总体特征性能上仍然存在不足。为此，本文提出了一种新的FL框架PS-FedGAN，只需要部分的GAN模型共享，其中包括全局鉴别网络和部分共享的生成网络，可以以部分合作的方式协作学习全局数据统计并基于部分共享GAN进行本地数据再生。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种高效的联合学习框架 PS-FedGAN，通过部分共享生成式对抗网络以保护数据隐私，实现了在分布数据环境下捕捉本地数据总体特征，相比于现有框架具有更好的收敛速度、通信开销和隐私保护效果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel FL framework named PS-FedGAN, which requires only partial GAN model sharing to enhance data regeneration in a partially collaborative way among FL clients. PS-FedGAN can capture overall feature properties of local client data under practical data heterogeneity among FL clients while preserving data privacy, and it outperforms existing FL frameworks in terms of convergence speed, communication overhead and privacy preservation."
