We present the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves weak recovery at the Kesten-Stigum threshold even in the presence of a small constant fraction of corrupted nodes. Prior to this work, even state-of-the-art robust algorithms were known to break under such node corruption adversaries, when close to the Kesten-Stigum threshold.  We further extend our techniques to the $Z_2$ synchronization problem, where our algorithm reaches the optimal recovery threshold in the presence of similar strong adversarial perturbations.  The key ingredient of our algorithm is a novel identifiability proof that leverages the push-out effect of the Grothendieck norm of principal submatrices.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在节点破坏随机块模型下的强健社区检测，其中对于$n$个顶点中的一个部分具有任意修改边缘权重的敌手。我们提出了第一个多项式时间算法，在小的破坏节点比例下即可达到Kesten-Stigum临界点的弱恢复。在这项工作之前，即使是最先进的强健性算法，在接近Kesten-Stigum临界点时也会被节点破坏敌手攻破。我们进一步将我们的技术扩展到$Z_2$同步问题，其中我们的算法在存在类似的强破坏敌手波动时也能达到最优恢复阈值。我们算法的关键因素是一种新型的可识别性证明，利用主子矩阵的Grothendieck范数推出的推出　作用。",
