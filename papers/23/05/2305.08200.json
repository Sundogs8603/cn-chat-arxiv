    "translated_abstract": "与认知障碍的老年人交流时，认知刺激（CS）有助于维护老年人的认知健康。数据稀缺是构建基于CS的对话系统的主要挑战，特别是在中文方面。为了填补这一空白，我们构建了一份中国CS对话（CSConv）数据集，其中包含约2.6K组具有CS原则和情感支持策略标签的对话。在提供情感支持的同时聊天是大多数现有认知对话系统所忽视的。在本文中，我们提出了一种多源知识融合的认知刺激对话（CSD）方法，以生成在CS原则和情感支持策略指导下的开放式回复。我们首先使用基于外部知识的渐进式遮盖方法来学习编码器作为有效的分类器，这是预测目标响应的CS原则和情感支持策略的前提。然后，解码器与感知的CS原则相互作用来生成响应。",
