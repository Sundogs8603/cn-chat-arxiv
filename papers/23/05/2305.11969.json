    "translated_abstract": "在答案集规划（ASP）中，用户可以声明性地定义问题，并使用高效的求解器来解决它; ASP的实际应用无数，且已成功地解决了几个约束问题。但是，解决时间通常以超线性方式增长（通常是指数级）相对于实例的大小，这对于大型实例是不实际的。一个广泛使用的方法是将优化问题分割为顺序解决的子问题，某些子问题提交到由其他子问题指定的值，并通过并置单个子问题的解的解决方案重构整个问题的有效分配。这种方法一方面更快，由于超线性行为;另一方面，它不提供任何最优性保证：承诺解决一个子问题的分配可能会将最优解从搜索空间中排除。在其他研究领域中，基于逻辑的Benders分解（LBBD）证明是解决大规模优化问题的有效方法，确保最优性保证;但是，在ASP中的影响尚未完全探索。在本文中，我们提出并评估了一种LBBD方法，用于管理异构资源和目标的实际问题慢性门诊的预约。实验结果突出了我们的方法在效率，可扩展性和最优性方面的有效性，并与最先进的基于ASP和基于CP的求解器进行了比较。",
