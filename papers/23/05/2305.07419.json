    "translated_abstract": "现代推荐系统中的主要挑战之一是如何有效地利用多模态内容实现更个性化的推荐。尽管有各种各样的解决方案，但大多数解决方案都忽略了独立特征提取过程所获得知识与下游推荐任务之间的不匹配。具体而言，多模态特征提取过程未纳入与推荐任务相关的先前知识，而推荐任务经常直接将这些多模态特征用作辅助信息。这种不匹配可能导致模型拟合偏差和性能下降，本文将其称为“知识诅咒”问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出使用知识软融合平衡多模态特征利用和知识诅咒问题带来的负面影响。为此，我们提出了一个适用于多模态推荐的知识软融合框架，简称KSI，它将领域特定的知识集成到特征提取和推荐过程中。在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，KSI在推荐准确性和多样性方面超越了几种最先进的方法。",
