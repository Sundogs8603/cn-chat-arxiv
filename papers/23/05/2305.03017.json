This is because developers often spend significant time searching for relevant code examples on the internet, utilizing open-source projects and informal documentation. For finding useful code examples, informal documentation, such as Stack Overflow discussions and forums, can be invaluable. We have focused our research on Stack Overflow, which is a popular resource for discussing different topics among software developers. For increasing the quality of the recommended code examples, we have collected and recommended the best code examples in the Java programming language. We have utilized BERT in our approach, which is a Large Language Model (LLM) for text representation that can effectively extract semantic information from textual data.

    "translated_abstract": "过去和最近一直在进行代码示例推荐的研究，以帮助开发人员完成软件开发任务。由于开发人员经常花费大量时间在互联网上寻找相关的代码示例，利用开源项目和非正式文档。为了找到有用的代码示例，非正式文档（如Stack Overflow讨论和论坛）可以非常宝贵。我们的研究重点是Stack Overflow，它是软件开发人员讨论不同主题的流行资源。为了提高推荐代码示例的质量，我们收集并推荐了Java编程语言中最佳的代码示例。我们采用了BERT来进行处理，它是一个大型语言模型（LLM），可以有效地从文本数据中提取语义信息。我们的第一步是使用BERT将代码示例转换为数值向量。",
