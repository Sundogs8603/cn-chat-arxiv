    "translated_abstract": "条件图生成任务涉及训练模型生成一个给定一组输入条件的图。许多以前的研究采用自回归模型逐步生成图组件，如节点和边缘。然而，由于图通常缺乏其组件之间的自然顺序，将图转换为一系列标记并不直截了当。虽然之前的工作大多依赖于传统的启发式方法或图遍历方法（如广度优先搜索（BFS）或深度优先搜索（DFS））将图转换为序列，但排序对图的生成影响的问题在很大程度上尚未被探讨。本文通过以下几点对这个问题做出了贡献：(1)强调了排序在自回归图生成模型中的关键作用，(2) 提出了一个新的理论框架，将排序视为降维问题，从而更深入地理解排序和所生成图的准确性之间的关系，(3)引入了 \"la...",
