    "translated_abstract": "语音超分辨率(SSR)旨在从其对应的低分辨率(LR)语音中恢复高分辨率(HR)语音。最近的SSR方法更加关注幅度谱的重建，忽略了相位重建的重要性，从而限制了恢复质量。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种基于改进离散余弦变换(MDCT)的新型SSR框架mdctGAN。通过在MDCT域中进行对抗学习，我们的方法以相位感知的方式重建HR语音，无需声码器或额外的后处理。此外，通过学习具有自我关注机制的频率一致特征，mdctGAN保证了高质量的语音重建。在VCTK语料库数据集上，实验结果显示我们的模型具有自然的听觉质量，MOS和PESQ得分高。 它还在48kHz目标分辨率上从各种输入速率中实现了最先进的log-spectral-distance(LSD)性能。代码可供使用。",
