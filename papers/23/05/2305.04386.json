    "abstract": "To construct models of large, multivariate complex systems, such as those in biology, one needs to constrain which variables are allowed to interact. This can be viewed as detecting \"local\" structures among the variables. In the context of a simple toy model of 2D natural and synthetic images, we show that pairwise correlations between the variables -- even when severely undersampled -- provide enough information to recover local relations, including the dimensionality of the data, and to reconstruct arrangement of pixels in fully scrambled images. This proves to be successful even though higher order interaction structures are present in our data. We build intuition behind the success, which we hope might contribute to modeling complex, multivariate systems and to explaining the success of modern attention-based machine learning approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了构建大型多变量复杂系统的模型，比如生物学中的系统，我们需要限制允许相互作用的变量。这可以被看作是检测变量之间的“局部”结构。在一个简单的二维自然和合成图像的玩具模型的背景下，我们展示了即使在严重欠采样的情况下，变量之间的成对相关性也提供足够的信息来恢复局部关系，包括数据的维度，并且能够重构完全混乱的图像中像素的排列。尽管我们的数据中存在高阶相互作用结构，但这种方法被证明是成功的。我们对成功背后的原因进行了直观分析，希望能对建模复杂多变量系统以及解释现代基于关注机制的机器学习方法的成功有所贡献。",
