    "translated_abstract": "在可解释的人工智能领域中，因果关系例子通过指出更改实例以更改其预测的修改来解释受过训练的决策模型的预测结果。这些因果关系例子通常定义为解决一个优化问题的解决方案，其中代价函数结合了几个衡量满足用户需求的良好解释的标准。可以考虑多种这样适当的性质，因为用户需求通常是未知的，而且不同用户之间也有所不同；它们的选择和规范化是困难的。为了解决这个问题，一些方法提出生成一组不同的因果关系例子来解释一个预测结果，而不是单个的。本文提出了对这个多样性概念的许多、有时相互矛盾的定义的综述。它讨论了它们的基本原则、假设、优势和局限性。此外，它介绍了一些关于这个特定研究主题的最新工作和未来发展方向。",
