    "translated_abstract": "问题回答在人类日常生活中起着至关重要的作用，因为它涉及我们对世界知识的获得。然而，由于现实世界事实的动态和不断变化的特性，当问题的时间限制发生变化时，答案可能完全不同。最近，大型语言模型（LLM）显示出在问题回答方面的显著智能，而我们的实验证明上述问题仍然对现有LLM构成了一个重大挑战。这可以归因于LLM无法基于表面级文本语义进行严格的推理能力。为了克服这个局限性，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，不是要求LLM直接回答问题，而是将“问题回答任务”重新构架为“编程任务”（QAaP）。具体来说，通过利用现代LLM在理解自然语言和编程语言方面的卓越能力，我们努力 harness LLM models to craft programs that can solve time-sensitive questions.",
