    "translated_abstract": "在过去的几年中，公平聚类吸引了显着的关注，导致出现了大量不同的公平概念。虽然这些概念是有充分理据的，但它们通常在独立的情况下被考虑和研究，其中一个公平要求被独立地考虑而不考虑其他的。这导致了在公平聚类中理解不同公平概念之间的关系成为一个重要的开放问题。在本文中，我们朝向这个方向迈出了第一步。具体来说，我们考虑了聚类中最突出的两种人口统计学公平概念:(1)集团公正(GF)，在这种情况下，不同的人口统计学群体在每个聚类中应该有接近人口水平的代表;(2)中心选择中的多样性(DS)，在这种情况下，所选择的中心应该接近每个群体的人口水平表示。我们展示了在给定一个恒定的近似算法的情况下，一个快速的算法可以同时满足这两个概念。",
