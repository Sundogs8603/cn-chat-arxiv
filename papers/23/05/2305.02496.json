    "translated_abstract": "最近，将图神经网络（GNN）与对比学习相结合进行异常检测引起了越来越多的关注。现有的图对比异常检测（GCAD）方法主要集中于通过图扩充和多尺度对比模块改善检测能力。然而，这些模块的基本机制尚未得到充分的探索。我们深入研究了多尺度和图扩充机制，并观察到多尺度对比模块并没有增强表达，而多GNN模块是隐藏的贡献者。先前的研究往往将多GNN带来的收益归因于多尺度模块。在本文中，我们深入探讨了这种误解，并提出了多GNN和增强图对比框架MAG，将现有的GCAD方法统一在对比自监督的视角下。我们从MAG框架中提取了两个变体，L-MAG和M-MAG。L-MAG是轻量级的实例。",
