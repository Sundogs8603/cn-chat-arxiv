    "translated_abstract": "从观测数据中发现因果关系具有重要意义。未观察变量（例如潜在混杂或中介）的存在可能会导致错误的因果识别。为了克服这个问题，近端因果探索方法试图通过未观察变量的代理来调整偏差。特别地，基于假设检验的方法通过测试引发的线性违规来识别因果边缘。然而，这些方法只适用于有严格级别约束的离散数据，这限制了它们在现实世界中的应用。本文通过扩展近端假设检验来解决这个问题，以适用于由连续变量组成的系统。我们的策略是提出给定隐藏因子的观测变量的条件分布的正则条件，使得如果我们将其观察代理以足够的有限细格离散化，则涉及的离散化误差可以有效地受到控制。基于这个方法，我们提出并分析了一种具有一般先验限制的新近端因果搜索算法。",

The method is extendable to continuous variable systems and uses regularity conditions to control discretization error in identifying causal relations."
