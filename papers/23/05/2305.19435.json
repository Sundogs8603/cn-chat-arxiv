    "translated_abstract": "网络规模的搜索系统学习一个编码器来嵌入一个给定的查询，然后将其连接到近似最近邻搜索(ANNS)管道中来检索相似的数据点。为了准确地捕捉尾部查询和数据点，学习到的表示通常是刚性的、高维的向量，通常在整个ANNS管道中一成不变，并且可能导致计算上昂贵的检索。本文认为，与其使用刚性的表示形式，ANNS的不同阶段可以利用不同容量的自适应表示形式以获得显著的精度-计算折衷权衡，即可以进行更加近似计算的ANNS阶段应该使用相同数据点的低容量表示。为此，我们引入了AdANNS，一种新颖的ANNS设计框架，明确利用Matryoshka表示的灵活性。我们使用基于AdANNS的新型关键ANNS构建演示了最先进的精度-计算折衷权衡。",
