    "translated_abstract": "在具有潜在变量的因果发现中，我们定义了两个数据范式：确定数据：具有观察节点单值的单个骨架结构，和不确定数据：具有观察节点多值的一组多骨架结构。多个骨架引入低样本利用率，多个值引入了分布假设的无能力，这两者导致从不确定数据中恢复因果关系至今仍然未被充分探索。我们设计了因果强度变分模型来解决这两个问题。具体地，我们利用因果强度而不是独立噪声作为潜变量来调节证据下界。通过这种设计思想，不同骨架的因果强度被看作是一个分布，并可以表示为单值因果图矩阵。此外，考虑到潜在混淆因素，我们将因果图G分解为两个相关子图O和C。O包含观察节点之间的纯关系，而C表示混淆因素。",
