    "translated_abstract": "通过被动数据，我们能够学习到关于因果关系和实验的什么信息？鉴于被动训练的语言模型在工具使用等交互领域的最新成功，这个问题变得很重要。被动学习本质上是有限的。然而，我们展示了纯粹的被动学习实际上能够让智能体学习到一般化的策略，用于确定和使用因果关系结构，只要智能体能够在测试时干预。我们在形式上说明了首先进行实验，然后寻求目标的策略能够原则上使被动学习实现一般化。然后，我们从经验上展示了通过模仿专家数据进行训练的智能体在测试时能够推断和使用训练数据中从未出现的因果链接；这些智能体还能够将实验策略推广到从未在训练中观察到的新变量集。然后，我们展示了从被动数据中一般化因果干预和利用策略。",
