    "translated_abstract": "传统上，不同类型的特征算子（例如卷积、自注意和内卷积）利用不同的方法提取和聚合特征。从它们的数学公式中很难发现相似之处。然而，这三个算子都拥有同样重要的作用，在本质上并没有区别。因此，我们从一个高层次的角度探索各种特征算子的本质，等效地转换它们的组件，并在更高的维度内探索它们的数学表达式。我们提出了一种清晰而具体的不同特征算子的统一公式，称为Evolution。Evolution利用进化函数生成进化核，该核提取并聚合输入特征映射中特定位置的特征。我们从数学上推导出了从这些特征算子的传统公式到进化公式的等效转换，并证明了这种统一性。此外，我们还讨论了统一公式的优势以及如何将其应用于实际问题中。",
