    "translated_abstract": "股票市场的价格预测一直是一个经典而具有挑战性的问题，备受经济学家和计算机科学家的关注。近年来，图神经网络通过在公司关系上运用深度学习，显著提高了预测性能。然而，现有的关系图通常是通过人工标记或自然语言处理构建的，这需要大量的资源，且准确性不高。此外，它们无法有效地响应关系图中动态变化的情况。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一种基于时间和异构图神经网络(THGNN)的方法，以学习金融时间序列中价格变动之间的动态关系。具体而言，我们首先根据公司的历史价格生成每个交易日的公司关系图。然后，我们利用Transformer编码器将价格变动信息编码成时间表示。随后，我们提出了一个带有注意机制的异构图神经网络模块，以整合时间表示和公司关系图，以提高预测性能。我们的实验证明，所提出的模型在模拟和真实的金融数据集上均优于现有最先进的方法。",
