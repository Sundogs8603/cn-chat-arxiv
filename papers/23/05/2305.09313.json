    "abstract": "In passage retrieval system, the initial passage retrieval results may be unsatisfactory, which can be refined by a reranking scheme. Existing solutions to passage reranking focus on enriching the interaction between query and each passage separately, neglecting the context among the top-ranked passages in the initial retrieval list.

    "translated_abstract": "在段落检索系统中，初始检索结果可能不尽如人意，需要通过重新排序方案进行改善。现有的段落重新排序方案主要集中于丰富查询和每个段落之间的交互，忽略了在初始检索列表中排名靠前的多个段落之间的上下文关系。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种混合与协作的段落再排序方法（HybRank），该方法利用上游检索器的相似性度量进行段落协作，并结合稀疏和密集检索器的词汇和语义属性进行重新排序。此外，基于现成的检索器特征，HybRank是一个插件再排序器，能够增强包括先前重新排序的段落列表在内的任意段落列表。大量实验证明了比普遍的检索和再排序方法性能稳定的提升，并验证了HybRank的核心组件的有效性。",
