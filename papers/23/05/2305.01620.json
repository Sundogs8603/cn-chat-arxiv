    "abstract": "Recently there have been efforts to introduce new benchmark tasks for spoken language understanding (SLU), like semantic parsing. In this paper, we describe our proposed spoken semantic parsing system for the quality track (Track 1) in Spoken Language Understanding Grand Challenge which is part of ICASSP Signal Processing Grand Challenge 2023. We experiment with both end-to-end and pipeline systems for this task. Strong automatic speech recognition (ASR) models like Whisper and pretrained Language models (LM) like BART are utilized inside our SLU framework to boost performance. We also investigate the output level combination of various models to get an exact match accuracy of 80.8, which won the 1st place at the challenge.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，有一些新的基准任务被引入用于口语理解（SLU），例如语义解析。本文介绍了我们针对ICASSP信号处理大挑战2023中的口语语言理解大挑战的质量轨迹（Track 1）提出的口语语义解析系统。我们尝试了端到端和pipeline系统来完成这项任务。我们在SLU框架中使用了强大的自动语音识别（ASR）模型，如Whisper，以及预训练的语言模型（LM），如BART，来提高性能。我们还研究了不同模型的输出级别组合，以获得80.8的精确匹配度，这使我们在挑战中获得了第一名。",
