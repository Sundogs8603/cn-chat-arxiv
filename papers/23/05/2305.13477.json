    "abstract": "Given a prefix (context), open-ended generation aims to decode texts that are coherent, which don't abruptly drift from previous topics, and informative, which don't suffer from undesired repetitions. In this paper, we propose Look-back, an improved decoding algorithm that leverages the Kullback-Leibler divergence to track the distribution distance between current and historical decoding steps. Thus Look-back can automatically predict potential repetitive phrase and topic drift, and remove tokens that may cause the failure modes, restricting the next token probability distribution within a plausible distance to the history. We perform decoding experiments on document continuation and story generation, and demonstrate that Look-back is able to generate more fluent and coherent text, outperforming other strong decoding methods significantly in both automatic and human evaluations.",

    "translated_abstract": "给定一个前缀（上下文）时，自由生成就意味着解码出连贯的文本，不会突然偏离前面的主题和信息量多，不会出现不必要的重复。在本文中，我们提出了Look-back算法，一种改进的解码算法，它利用Kullback-Leibler散度来跟踪当前和历史解码步骤之间的分布距离。因此，Look-back可以自动预测可能的重复短语和主题偏移，并删除可能导致失败的令牌，将下一个令牌概率分布限制在可能的距离范围内，以便更好地符合历史。我们在文档延续和故事生成上执行解码实验，并证明Look-back能够生成更流畅和连贯的文本，在自动和人工评估中显著优于其他强的解码方法。",
