    "abstract": "To address the problem of NLP classifiers learning spurious correlations between training features and target labels, a common approach is to make the model's predictions invariant to these features. However, this can be counter-productive when the features have a non-zero causal effect on the target label and thus are important for prediction. Therefore, using methods from the causal inference literature, we propose an algorithm to regularize the learnt effect of the features on the model's prediction to the estimated effect of feature on label. This results in an automated augmentation method that leverages the estimated effect of a feature to appropriately change the labels for new augmented inputs. On toxicity and IMDB review datasets, the proposed algorithm minimises spurious correlations and improves the minority group (i.e., samples breaking spurious correlations) accuracy, while also improving the total accuracy compared to standard training.",

    "translated_abstract": "针对NLP分类器学习训练特征和目标标签之间误导性相关性的问题，一种常见的方法是使模型的预测对这些特征具有不变性。然而，当这些特征对目标标签有非零因果效应并且对预测很重要时，这种方法可能会产生反作用。因此，我们使用因果推断文献中的方法，提出了一种算法，将学习到的特征对模型预测的效应规范化为特征对标签的估计效应。这导致了一种自动化的增强方法，利用特征的估计效应适当地改变新增的输入的标签。在毒性和IMDB评论数据集上，所提出的算法最小化了误导性相关性，并提高了少数群体（即打破误导性相关性的样本）的准确性，同时也提高了总体准确性。",
