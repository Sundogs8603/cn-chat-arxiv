    "abstract": "Speech processing techniques are useful for analyzing speech and language development in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), who are often varied and delayed in acquiring these skills. Early identification and intervention are crucial, but traditional assessment methodologies such as caregiver reports are not adequate for the requisite behavioral phenotyping.

Researchers have developed benchmarks for spoken language capabilities in children with ASD, obtainable through the analysis of NLS.

    "translated_abstract": "语音处理技术对于分析孤独症谱系障碍(ASD)儿童的语音和语言发展很有帮助，这些孩子在获得这些技能方面常常是多样性和延迟的。尽早识别和干预是至关重要的，但传统的评估方法如护理人员报告对于所需行为表型描述是不足够的。通过自然语言样本(NLS)分析已获得关注作为一种有前途的补充手段。研究人员在分析NLS中孤独症儿童的口语能力水平时已经制定了基准。本文提出了语音处理技术的应用，通过分类来支持儿童口语语言发展的自动化评估，包括分辨儿童和成人语音，以及语音和非语言发声，其F1宏平均分别为82.6％和67.8％，强调了ASD研究和临床应用的潜力。",
