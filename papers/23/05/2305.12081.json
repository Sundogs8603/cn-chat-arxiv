    "translated_abstract": "基础模型是在大规模数据上预先训练的模型，可以在许多下游任务中表现良好。它们在自然语言处理和计算机视觉方面取得了显著的成功。然而，这种模型在表格预测任务中的使用受到限制，主要问题包括 (1) 缺乏大规模和多样化的带有标准标签的表格数据集，以及 (2) 不同领域之间的模式不匹配和预测目标的异质性。本文提出了一种方法，用于构建基于 AnyPredict 的表格预测基础模型的大规模训练数据，包括领域内和广泛的领域外数据集。该方法使用数据引擎，利用大型语言模型 (LLM) 来整合表格样本，克服了不同模式表格之间的障碍，并使用“学习，注释和审计”流程将领域外数据与目标任务对齐。扩展的训练数据使预训练的 AnyPredict 能够支持每个表格领域。",
