    "translated_abstract": "点击率预测是推荐系统的主要任务之一，用户针对不同项目进行点击以获取推荐结果。针对数据稀疏性、用户-项目交互的长尾分布和项目或用户的冷启动等问题，提出了跨领域点击率预测模型。为了使源域到目标域的知识转移更加顺畅，提出了创新性的深度跨领域点击率预测模型——领域对抗深度兴趣网络 (DADIN)，将跨域推荐任务转化为领域适应问题。通过引入领域不可知层和特别设计的损失，创新地实现了两个领域的联合分布对齐，并采用对抗训练的方式与点击率预测损失一起进行优化。实验结果表明，在华为数据集上，DADIN 的曲线下面积 (AUC) 比最具竞争力的基线高出0.08％，高出0.7％。",
