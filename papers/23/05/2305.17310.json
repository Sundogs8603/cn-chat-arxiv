    "translated_abstract": "集合相似度的度量是几种数据挖掘任务的核心方面。例如，在网页搜索中删除重复结果的常见方法是查看所有页面对之间的Jaccard指数。在社交网络分析中，一种备受赞赏的度量是Adamic-Adar指数，广泛用于比较预测链接中的节点邻域集合。然而，随着要处理的数据量增加，计算所有成对之间的确切相似度可能是棘手的。这种规模上的挑战已经激发了对于集合相似度度量的有效估计器的研究。最流行的两种估计器，MinHash和SimHash，的确被用于需要处理大量数据的应用程序，如文档去重和推荐系统。考虑到这些任务的重要性，推进估计器的需求是显然的。我们提出了DotHash，这是两个集合交集大小的无偏估计器。",
