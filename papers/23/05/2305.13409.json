This result follows as a special case of an algorithm for learning states with large stabilizer dimension, where a quantum state has stabilizer dimension $k$ if it is stabilized by an abelian group of $2^k$ Pauli operators.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种算法，可以有效地学习通过克利福德门和$O(\\log(n))$个非克利福德门制备的量子状态。具体而言，对于最多使用$t$个非克利福德门制备的$n$量子比特状态$|\\psi\\rangle$，我们证明可以用$\\mathsf{poly}(n,2^t,1/\\epsilon)$时间和$|\\psi\\rangle$的复制来学习$|\\psi\\rangle$，使其跟真实状态的距离不超过$\\epsilon$。该结果是一个稳定维数较大的状态学习算法的特例，当一个量子状态的稳定子维数为$k$，表示它被一个由$2^k$个Pauli算子的Abel群稳定。",
