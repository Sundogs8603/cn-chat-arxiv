    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了零和可微分博弈的梯度方法对局部纳什均衡的收敛性。众所周知，当 $S \\succ 0$ 时，这种动态会在局部收敛，而当 $S = 0$ 时可能会发散，其中 $S \\succeq 0$ 是均衡时雅可比矩阵的对称部分，它占据了游戏的 “势能” 组件。我们表明，只要 $S$ 不为零（部分曲率），并且反对称部分 $A$ 的特征向量与 $S$ 的核相对位置良好，这些动态也会收敛。然后，我们研究了当 $S \\ll A$ 时的收敛速度，并证明它们通常取决于 $S$ 的特征值的平均值，而不是最小值，这与最小化问题的类比所建议的相反。为了说明我们的结果，我们考虑计算连续博弈的混合纳什均衡问题。我们表明，由于部分曲率，锥形粒子方法——它在混合策略的权重和支持上进行优化——呈现出一致的局部收敛性，而标准的对偶梯度方法则可能会发散。",
