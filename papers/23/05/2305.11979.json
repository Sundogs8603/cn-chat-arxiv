    "abstract": "We explore how weak supervision on abundant unlabeled data can be leveraged to improve few-shot performance in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) tasks. We propose a pipeline approach to construct a noisy ABSA dataset, and we use it to adapt a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model to the ABSA tasks. We test the resulting model on three widely used ABSA datasets, before and after fine-tuning. Our proposed method preserves the full fine-tuning performance while showing significant improvements (15.84% absolute F1) in the few-shot learning scenario for the harder tasks. In zero-shot (i.e., without fine-tuning), our method outperforms the previous state of the art on the aspect extraction sentiment classification (AESC) task and is, additionally, capable of performing the harder aspect sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE) task.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了如何利用大量未标记数据的弱监督来提高少样本方面情感分析（ABSA）任务的性能。我们提出了一种管道方法来构建一个嘈杂的ABSA数据集，并将其用于调整预训练的序列到序列模型以适应ABSA任务。我们在三个广泛使用的ABSA数据集上测试了结果模型，在微调之前和之后。我们提出的方法在保持完整微调性能的同时，在较难的任务的少样本学习场景中显示出显着的改进（15.84％绝对F1）。在零样本（即无需微调）中，我们的方法胜过以前的状态艺术在方面提取情感分类（AESC）任务上，此外还能够执行更难的方面情感三元组提取（ASTE）任务。",
