    "abstract": "Misinformation, i.e. factually incorrect information, is often conveyed in multiple modalities, e.g. an image accompanied by a caption. It is perceived as more credible by humans, and spreads faster and wider than its text-only counterparts. While an increasing body of research investigates automated fact-checking (AFC), previous surveys mostly focus on textual misinformation. In this survey, we conceptualise a framework for AFC including subtasks unique to multimodal misinformation. Furthermore, we discuss related terminological developed in different communities in the context of our framework. We focus on four modalities prevalent in real-world fact-checking: text, image, audio, and video. We survey benchmarks and models, and discuss limitations and promising directions for future research.",

    "translated_abstract": "错误信息，即事实上不正确的信息，通常以多种形式传达，例如带有标题的图像。 它被人们视为更可信，比其仅限于文本的对应物扩散速度更快，范围更广。 尽管越来越多的研究涉及自动事实核查（AFC），但以往的调查主要集中在文本误导方面。 在本调查中，我们构建了一个包括多模态误导独特子任务在内的AFC框架。此外，我们在我们的框架上讨论了不同社区所发展的相关术语。 我们重点关注现实世界事实核查中存在的四种模态：文本，图像，音频和视频。 我们调查了基准和模型，并讨论了未来研究的局限性和有前途的方向。",
