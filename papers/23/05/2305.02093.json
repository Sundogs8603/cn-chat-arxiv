    "translated_abstract": "构建决策树在线是一个经典的机器学习问题。现有工作通常假设每个进入的数据点的特征已经准备好了。然而，在许多实际应用中，特征值和标签都是未知的，只能以一定的成本获取。例如，在医学诊断中，医生必须选择对病人进行哪些测试（即进行昂贵的特征查询），以便做出诊断决策（即预测标签）。我们提供了一个新的视角来解决这个实际难题。我们的框架包括一个嵌入在线学习方案的主动计划预测器，我们研究了几个信息收集功能。具体而言，我们采用了一种基于自适应子模性的代理信息获取函数，以最小的成本主动查询特征值，同时使用后验抽样方案来保持在线预测的低遗憾度。我们在合成和真实数据集上展示了我们提出的方法的效率和有效性，在几个基准测试上实现了最先进的性能。",
