    "translated_abstract": "不断产生大量新的恶意软件，我们需要将其与良性样本区分开来，并将其分类到恶意软件家族中。为此，我们需要研究现有恶意软件家族是如何发展，以及如何检查新出现的恶意软件家族。本文重点研究对入侵样本进行在线处理，将其分配给现有家族，或在新家族的情况下对其进行聚类。我们使用 EMBER 数据集中的七个流行恶意软件家族，其中四个在训练集中，另外三个在测试集中。通过多层感知器的分类得分，我们确定哪些样本将被分类，哪些将被聚类到新的恶意软件家族中。我们以平衡准确度为 95.33% 对 97.21% 的流数据进行了分类，然后使用自组织映射对剩余数据进行了聚类，实现了纯度从四个聚类的 47.61% 到十个聚类的 77.68%。",
