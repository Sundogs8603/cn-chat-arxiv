    "translated_abstract": "变换器和注意力编码器-解码器（AED）是用于语音到文本任务的两种广泛使用的框架。 它们针对不同的目的进行设计，每种方法在语音到文本任务中都有其优点和缺点。为了利用两种建模方法的优势，我们提出了一种通过结合变换器和注意力编码器-解码器（TAED）处理语音到文本任务的解决方案。该新方法利用了AED中关于非单调序列到序列学习的优势，同时保留了变换器的流式属性。在所提出的框架中，变换器和AED共享同一个语音编码器。变换器中的预测器被AED模型中的解码器所取代，解码器的输出是基于语音输入而不是基于无条件的语言模型输出的。所提出的解决方案确保了通过涵盖所有可能的读取/写入场景来优化模型，并为流式应用程序创造了匹配的环境。我们对所提出的方法进行了评估。",
