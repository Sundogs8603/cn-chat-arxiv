    "abstract": "The MACE architecture represents the state of the art in the field of machine learning force fields for a variety of in-domain, extrapolation and low-data regime tasks. In this paper, we further evaluate MACE by fitting models for published benchmark datasets. We show that MACE generally outperforms alternatives for a wide range of systems from amorphous carbon and general small molecule organic chemistry to large molecules and liquid water. We demonstrate the capabilities of the model on tasks ranging from constrained geometry optimisation to molecular dynamics simulations and find excellent performance across all tested domains. We show that MACE is very data efficient, and can reproduce experimental molecular vibrational spectra when trained on as few as 50 randomly selected reference configurations. We further demonstrate that the strictly local atom-centered model is sufficient for such tasks even in the case of large molecules and weakly interacting molecular assemblies.",

    "translated_abstract": "MACE架构代表了机器学习力场在各种领域中的最新技术，能够处理内域、外推和低数据范围任务。本文对MACE进行了进一步评估，通过拟合已发表的基准数据集的模型来表明MACE在各种体系中的性能优于其他替代方案，包括非晶碳、一般的小分子有机化学、大分子和液态水。我们展示了模型在各个领域的能力，从约束几何优化到分子动力学模拟，发现其在所有测试领域都具有出色的性能。我们还表明，当在仅50个随机选定的参考配置上进行训练时，MACE即可非常高效地复现实验分子振动光谱。我们进一步证明，即使在大分子和弱相互作用的分子组装的情况下，这种基于严格局部的原子中心模型也是足够适用的。",
