    "translated_abstract": "深度学习的最新进展赋予了各种智能交通应用以力量，特别是在共享汽车平台上。传统的共享汽车服务运营高度依赖于车队管理中的人类参与，现代共享汽车平台则允许用户在使用前后上传汽车图像，以检查汽车而无需实地访问。为了自动化上述检查任务，之前的方法利用了深度神经网络并普遍采用了预训练技术以在有限的标记数据集下建立有效的模型。由于处理汽车图像的候选从业者很可能会遭受标记数据集的缺乏，因此我们对预训练的有效性进行了复杂的类比分析。然而，之前的研究主要集中于预训练的效果缺乏深入剖析。鉴于上述分析缺乏，我们的研究介绍了一系列分析，以探究预训练在大规模共享汽车平台中的有效性。我们在大规模汽车图像数据集上尝试了不同的预训练策略，并将已预训练的模型的性能与从头开始训练的传统模型进行比较。我们的发现表明，预训练技术确实提高了汽车图像分析的性能，无论是在准确性还是效率方面。我们的研究为在共享汽车平台应用中探究预训练的有效性提供了洞见。",
