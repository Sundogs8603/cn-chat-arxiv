    "translated_abstract": "大规模时变图在金融、社会和生物学等领域越来越普遍。有效提取编码稀疏、多层、动态图复杂结构的特征存在计算和方法上的挑战。拓扑数据分析（TDA）中的持久化图（PD）已成为具有明确定义距离的数据形状描述符的热门选择。然而，TDA在图上的应用仍然很少探讨。本文通过引入一种计算效率高的框架来从图数据中提取形状信息，填补了文献中的这一空白。我们的框架有两个主要步骤：首先，我们使用所谓的下星过滤器（lower-star filtration）使用定量节点属性计算PD，然后在一维网格上通过平均相关的Betti函数来矢量化它。我们的方法避免了传统基于图的方法中特征的组合爆炸，并在合成和真实的时变图的异常检测上实现了最先进的表现。",

The approach avoids the combinatorial explosion of features in traditional graph-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection on both synthetic and real-world time-varying graphs."
