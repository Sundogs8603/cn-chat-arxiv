    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种完全基于信息论的贝叶斯统计模型的重整化方法，称为贝叶斯重整化。贝叶斯重整化的主要思想是使用Fisher度量来定义一个相关长度，这个长度起到了紧密相关的概率分布点之间的可分辨性(RG)尺度。这个RG尺度可以被解释为在统计推断实验中对于一个给定系统可以得到的最大特异性观察数量的代理。贝叶斯重整化方法的作用是为给定系统准备一个在上述尺度上精度有限的有效模型。在将贝叶斯重整化方法应用于物理系统时，这个由信息论出现的RG尺度自然地被识别为当前实验装置可以探测到的最大能量，因此，贝叶斯重整化提出了一种发现和表征基本物理理论的新框架。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposed a Bayesian statistical model-based renormalization method, with the emergence of a Fisher metric to define a correlation length representing the distinguishability between nearby probability distribution points, acting as a resolution scale in a statistical inference experiment. This method prepares an effective model for a given system with a precision bounded by the aforementioned scale and could serve as a new framework for discovering and characterizing fundamental physical theories."
