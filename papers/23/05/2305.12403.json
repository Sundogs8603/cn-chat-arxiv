    "translated_abstract": "时空点过程是带有时间和空间的随机事件集合。由于计算复杂度的限制，现有的时空点过程解决方案在考虑时间和空间分布时，会妥协于条件独立性，未能很好地建模联合分布。这导致在描述与过去事件相关的时空相互作用时能力受到限制。本文提出一种新的参数化框架，利用扩散模型来学习复杂的时空联合分布。我们将目标联合分布的学习分解为多个步骤，其中每个步骤可以被一个高斯分布很好地描述。为了增强每个步骤的学习, 我们提出了一个精心设计的时空共同注意力模块，以自适应地捕捉事件时间和空间之间的相互依赖性。我们第一次打破了对时空相互作用限制的规定，提出了一种完全灵活的时空点过程框架。实验结果表明，我们提出的方法在时空点过程的可能性和事件预测方面均优于现有方法。",

The proposed method outperforms existing methods in both likelihood and event prediction for spatio-temporal point processes."
