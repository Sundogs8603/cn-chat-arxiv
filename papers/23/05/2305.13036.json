    "abstract": "Multivariate time-series (MTS) forecasting is a paramount and fundamental problem in many real-world applications. The core issue in MTS forecasting is how to effectively model complex spatial-temporal patterns. In this paper, we develop a modular and interpretable forecasting framework, which seeks to individually model each component of the spatial-temporal patterns. We name this framework SCNN, short for Structured Component-based Neural Network. SCNN works with a pre-defined generative process of MTS, which arithmetically characterizes the latent structure of the spatial-temporal patterns. In line with its reverse process, SCNN decouples MTS data into structured and heterogeneous components and then respectively extrapolates the evolution of these components, the dynamics of which is more traceable and predictable than the original MTS. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that SCNN can achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art models on three real-world data",

    "translated_abstract": "多元时间序列（MTS）预测是许多现实世界应用中一个极为重要和基本的问题。 MTS预测中的核心问题是如何有效地建模复杂的空间 - 时间模式。 在本文中，我们开发了一个模块化且可解释的预测框架，该框架旨在单独对空间 - 时间模式的每个成分进行建模。 我们将此框架命名为SCNN，缩写为结构化基于成分的神经网络。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一个名为SCNN的模块化和解释性的预测框架，旨在单独对空间-时间模式的每个成分进行建模。SCNN使用预定义的MTS生成过程，将MTS数据分解为结构化和异构成分，然后分别推断这些成分的演化，能够实现比现有先进模型更高的性能。"
