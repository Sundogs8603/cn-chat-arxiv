    "translated_abstract": "5G软件栈漏洞和意外行为的有效性和效率对于5G的保障至关重要，特别是对于它在关键基础设施中的应用。测试方法和网络安全研究中的可伸缩性和自动化是主要挑战。本文提出了一种创新的方法，通过与代码库中的fuzz测试相对应的运行时分析文件自动检测5G软件栈中的漏洞、意外行为和性能下降，在srsRAN上进行了试验。我们首先通过fuzz测试生成的Logging Information (LogInfo)将运行时分析映射到高维度度量空间，然后基于它们的时间戳信息构建特征空间，最后进一步利用基于机器学习的分类算法，包括Logistic回归，K-近邻和随机森林对其对性能和安全属性的影响进行分类。",
