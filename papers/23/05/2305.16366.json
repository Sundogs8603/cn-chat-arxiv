    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在形式定理证明领域提供了有趣的探索方向。然而，如何完全利用这些模型，特别是在演示格式和组织方面，仍然是一个未被充分探索的领域。为了增强LLMs的效能，作者提出了一个基于子目标的演示学习框架，包括两个主要元素：第一，从强化学习和机器人领域的子目标学习中汲取经验，为每个演示示例构建不同的子目标，并根据相关的子目标学习理论来优化这些子目标。第二，利用最近扩散模型的进展来预测最佳组织方式，同时解决演示组织领域中存在的两个复杂问题：子集选择和顺序确定。通过将基于子目标的学习方法与扩散模型相结合，作者提出的框架可以提高演示的可理解性，并提高LLMs在形式定理证明中的吞吐量。",
