    "translated_abstract": "计算机自适应测试(CAT)是一种可以准确测量学生知识水平且缩短测试时间的个性化测试形式。基于双层优化的CAT(BOBCAT)是一个最近的框架，它学习了一种数据驱动的问题选择算法，有效地缩短了测试时间并提高了测试准确性。然而，它存在高问题暴露率和测试重叠率的问题，这可能影响测试安全性。本文介绍了BOBCAT的一种约束版本，通过更改其优化设置使我们能够权衡测试准确性和问题暴露率及测试重叠率。我们通过在两个真实的成人测试数据集上进行大量实验，证明了这种方法的有效性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a constrained version of BOBCAT, a bi-level optimization-based computerized adaptive testing (CAT) framework, named C-BOBCAT. C-BOBCAT balances test accuracy and security by allowing trade-offs between test accuracy and question exposure/test overlap rates, addressing the high question exposure and test overlap rates problem in BOBCAT."
