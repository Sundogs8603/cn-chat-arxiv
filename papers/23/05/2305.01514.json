    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a model named \"PIMM\" which uses multi-task learning to model logical sequential dependence between tasks and applies it to financial marketing. The model addresses the issue of error accumulation and negative transfer in long-path sequential tasks, and takes into consideration of the sparsity of data through prior information merged model."
