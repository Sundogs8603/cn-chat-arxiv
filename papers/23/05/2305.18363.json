    "translated_abstract": "传统推荐系统中的解释已经证明在帮助用户理解推荐合理性以及提高系统效率、透明度和可信度方面具有益处。在对话环境中，需要生成多个上下文化解释，这进一步增加了解释的挑战。为了更好地衡量对话式推荐系统的可解释性，我们提出了十种评估视角，结合传统推荐系统的概念和对话式推荐系统的特点。我们使用这些指标评估了五个已有的对话式推荐系统基准数据集，并观察到需要提高对话式推荐系统的解释质量的必要性。为了实现这一目标，我们采用手动和自动方法扩展了这些对话，并构建了一个新的对话式推荐系统数据集，名为“可解释推荐对话”（E-ReDial）。该数据集包括756个对话，超过2000条高质量的重写解释。我们比较了两种基线方法，并进行了实验验证。",
