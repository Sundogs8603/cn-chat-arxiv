    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的人开始将预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）应用于规划问题。然而，直接使用LLMs作为规划器的方法目前在实际操作中并不可行，原因包括计划的正确性有限，与模拟器或实际环境的交互反馈依赖较强，以及利用人类反馈的效率低下。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种新的替代范式，通过规划领域定义语言（PDDL）构建一个显式的世界（领域）模型，然后使用它来进行具有良好领域独立性的规划。为了解决LLMs可能无法最初生成完全功能的PDDL模型的问题，我们将LLMs作为PDDL和纠正反馈源（如PDDL验证器和人类）之间的接口。对于没有PDDL背景的用户，我们证明LLMs可以将PDDL转化为自然语言，并将纠正反馈有效地编码回底层领域模型。",
