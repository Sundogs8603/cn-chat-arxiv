    "translated_abstract": "自动化仓储操作可以降低物流成本，最终降低消费品价格，提高交货速度，并增强对劳动力波动的抵抗能力。近年来，自动化重复任务的兴趣增加，但大多数是在受控环境中进行的。从杂乱的堆堆中挑选物品等任务直到最近才变得足够强大，可以在最小人工干预下进行大规模部署。本文展示了亚马逊机器人的Robot Induction（Robin）群的大规模包裹操作，该群利用在实际生产数据上训练的拾取成功预测器。具体而言，该系统在超过394K个拾取上进行了训练。它用于把每天高达5百万个包裹进行了分离，本文的评估期间操作了超过2亿个包裹。开发的学习拾取质量度量实时排名各种拾取替代方案，并采用高成功率的强力抓握策略。",
