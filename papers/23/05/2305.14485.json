    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱（KG）如DBpedia、Freebase、YAGO、Wikidata和NELL等被构建用来存储大规模、现实世界中的事实（主题、谓语、对象）三元组，可以被建模为一个图形，其中一个节点（主题或对象）代表具有属性的实体，并且有向边（谓词）是两个实体之间的关系。在Web搜索、问答、语义搜索、个人助手、事实检查和推荐中，查询 KG 是至关重要的。尽管在 KG 构建和维护方面已经取得了重大进展，但由于深度学习的影响，我们最近看到了KG 查询和问答研究方面的激增。我们调查的目的是双重的。首先，KG查询的研究由多个社群进行了研究，如数据库、数据挖掘、语义网、机器学习、信息检索和自然语言处理（NLP），关注点和术语不同。其次，我们还调查了最近的KG查询研究中使用的最新技术和方法。",
