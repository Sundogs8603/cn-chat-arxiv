    "translated_abstract": "深度学习利用射频数据中的模式识别和认证设备，为无线网络安全提供了新的功能。开放集检测是深度学习中的一个领域，它可以在部署期间识别来自新设备的样本，而这些设备不在训练集中。过去在开放集检测方面的工作主要应用于独立且同分布的数据，例如图像。相反，RF信号数据具有一系列独特的挑战，因为数据形成一个时间序列，并且样本之间存在非线性的时间依赖关系。我们引入了一种基于卷积神经网络长短期记忆模型中隐藏状态值模式的新型开放集检测方法。我们的方法极大地提高了在LoRa、无线WiFi和有线WiFi数据集上的精度-召回曲线下的面积，因此，可以成功用于监控和控制无线设备的未经授权的网络访问。",
