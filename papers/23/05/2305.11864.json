    "abstract": "The North S\\'{a}mi (NS) language encapsulates four primary dialectal variants that are related but that also have differences in their phonology, morphology, and vocabulary. The unique geopolitical location of NS speakers means that in many cases they are bilingual in S\\'{a}mi as well as in the dominant state language: Norwegian, Swedish, or Finnish. This enables us to study the NS variants both with respect to the spoken state language and their acoustic characteristics. In this paper, we investigate an extensive set of acoustic features, including MFCCs and prosodic features, as well as state-of-the-art self-supervised representations, namely, XLS-R, WavLM, and HuBERT, for the automatic detection of the four NS variants. In addition, we examine how the majority state language is reflected in the dialects. Our results show that NS dialects are influenced by the state language and that the four dialects are separable, reaching high classification accuracy, especially with the XLS-R mod",

    "translated_abstract": "北萨米语言包括四种主要的方言变体，它们在语音、形态和词汇上有所不同。北萨米语言使用者的特殊地缘政治位置意味着在许多情况下，他们既是萨米语使用者，也是优势国家语言（挪威语、瑞典语或芬兰语）的双语者。本文研究了一组广泛的声学特征，包括MFCC和韵律特征，以及最先进的自监督表示方法，即XLS-R、WavLM和HuBERT，用于自动检测四种北萨米方言变体。此外，我们还研究了优势国家语言如何反映在方言变体中。我们的研究结果表明，北萨米方言受到国家语言的影响，四种北萨米方言变体是可以分离的，并且使用XLS-R模型可获得很高的分类准确性。",
