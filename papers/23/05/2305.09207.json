    "translated_abstract": "近年来，由于在医疗保健和社会科学中的潜在应用，纵向数据中的反事实结果预测越来越受到关注。本文探讨了使用状态空间模型（一种流行的序列模型）进行这项任务的方法。具体而言，我们比较了两种模型的性能：Treatment Effect Neural Controlled Differential Equation（TE-CDE）和结构化状态空间模型（S4Model）。虽然TE-CDE利用可控微分方程来解决时间依赖性混淆，但它存在优化问题和训练缓慢的问题。相比之下，S4Model更有效地建模长期依赖关系，并且更容易训练。我们在一个模拟肺部肿瘤增长数据集上评估了这些模型，发现S4Model在每个时期的训练时间减少了1.63倍，并且归一化均方误差也提高了10倍。此外，相较TE-CDE，S4Model在训练期间更稳定，对权重初始化也不太敏感。我们的结果表明，由于其高效和稳定性，S4Model是纵向数据中反事实结果预测更为有前途的方法。",
