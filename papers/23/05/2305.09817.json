    "translated_abstract": "当前最先进的扩散模型已经在生成图像方面表现出色。然而，这些图片都是单调的，大多数都是训练集中人物图片的分布结果，难以为固定数量的个体生成多张图片。如果要解决这个问题，通常必须通过微调模型。这意味着，如果要绘制每个个体/动画角色图像，必须对其进行训练，而这种训练的硬件和成本常常超出了普通用户的能力，而普通用户实际上占了人数最多的一部分。为了解决这个问题，本文提出的角色图像特征编码器模型使得用户可以通过简单提供角色的图片，使生成的图像中的角色与期望匹配。此外，在过程中可以使用提示调整各种细节。与传统的图像到图像模型不同，本文提出的角色图像特征编码器模型不依赖于特定数据集的训练，因此是一种无需训练的人像图像生成方法。",
