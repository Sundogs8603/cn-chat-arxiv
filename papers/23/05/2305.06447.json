    "abstract": "Early detection of mental disorder is crucial as it enables prompt intervention and treatment, which can greatly improve outcomes for individuals suffering from debilitating mental affliction. The recent proliferation of mental health discussions on social media platforms presents research opportunities to investigate mental health and potentially detect instances of mental illness. However, existing depression detection methods are constrained due to two major limitations: (1) the reliance on feature engineering and (2) the lack of consideration for time-varying factors. Specifically, these methods require extensive feature engineering and domain knowledge, which heavily rely on the amount, quality, and type of user-generated content. Moreover, these methods ignore the important impact of time-varying factors on depression detection, such as the dynamics of linguistic patterns and interpersonal interactive behaviors over time on social media (e.g., replies, mentions, and quote-tweets)",

    "translated_abstract": "快速发现心理障碍至关重要，因为这样可以及时干预和治疗，从而大大改善患有严重心理疾病的个体的预后。社交媒体平台上最近出现的心理健康讨论的激增为研究心理健康提供了机会，并有可能检测到心理疾病的发生。然而，现有的抑郁症检测方法由于两个主要限制而受到限制：(1)依赖于特征工程，(2)没有考虑时变因素。具体而言，这些方法需要大量的特征工程和领域知识，其中严重依赖于用户生成内容的数量、质量和类型。此外，这些方法忽视了时变因素对抑郁症检测的重要影响，例如社交媒体上随时间推移而产生的语言模式和人际互动行为的动态变化(例如回复、提及和引用推文)。",
