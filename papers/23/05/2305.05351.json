    "translated_abstract": "神经架构搜索(NAS)已经成为了一种自动设计最优神经网络架构的有效方法之一。虽然一些人工设计的神经网络已经在多项任务中取得了人类水平的表现，但在NAS方法中很少出现这类成果，主要原因在于神经架构的搜索空间太大了，导致NAS算法效率低下。这项工作提出了一种新的架构搜索算法，称为GPT-NAS，通过生成式预训练模型来优化神经架构。在GPT-NAS中，我们假设一个在大规模语料库上预训练的生成模型能够学习构建神经架构的基本规律。因此，GPT-NAS利用生成式预训练模型来提出合理的架构组件，从而大大减少了搜索空间，引入了搜索过程中的先验知识。广泛的实验结果表明，我们的GPT-NAS方法明显优于其他NAS方法。",
