    "abstract": "With rapid technological growth, automatic pronunciation assessment has transitioned toward systems that evaluate pronunciation in various aspects, such as fluency and stress. However, despite the highly imbalanced score labels within each aspect, existing studies have rarely tackled the data imbalance problem. In this paper, we suggest a novel loss function, score-balanced loss, to address the problem caused by uneven data, such as bias toward the majority scores. As a re-weighting approach, we assign higher costs when the predicted score is of the minority class, thus, guiding the model to gain positive feedback for sparse score prediction. Specifically, we design two weighting factors by leveraging the concept of an effective number of samples and using the ranks of scores. We evaluate our method on the speechocean762 dataset, which has noticeably imbalanced scores for several aspects. Improved results particularly on such uneven aspects prove the effectiveness of our method.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着技术的迅速增长，自动发音评估已经向评估流畅度和重音等多个方面评价发音的系统过渡。然而，尽管每个方面内的分数标签高度不平衡，但现有的研究很少解决数据不平衡的问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的损失函数——分数平衡损失，以解决不均匀数据造成的问题，例如对多数分数的偏置。作为一种重新加权的方法，当预测分数属于少数类时，我们分配更高的成本，从而引导模型对稀疏分数预测获得正面反馈。具体而言，我们设计了两个加权因子，利用了有效样本数的概念和分数的排名。我们在 speechocean762 数据集上评估了我们的方法，该数据集在若干方面具有明显的不平衡分数。改进结果尤其在这种不平衡的方面表明了我们方法的有效性。",
