    "abstract": "This paper investigates the causal impact of negatively and positively framed ChatGPT Artificial Intelligence (AI) discussions on US students' anticipated labor market outcomes. Our findings reveal students reduce their confidence regarding their future earnings prospects after exposure to AI debates, and this effect is more pronounced after reading discussion excerpts with a negative tone. Unlike STEM majors, students in Non-STEM fields show asymmetric and pessimistic belief changes, suggesting that they might feel more vulnerable to emerging AI technologies. Pessimistic belief updates regarding future earnings are also prevalent across gender and GPA levels, indicating widespread AI concerns among all student subgroups. Educators, administrators, and policymakers may regularly engage with students to address their concerns and enhance educational curricula to better prepare them for a future that will be inevitably shaped by AI.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了负面和正面 ChatGPT人工智能（AI）讨论对美国学生预期劳动市场结果的因果影响。我们的研究发现，在接触AI讨论后，学生信心会降低，特别是在阅读负面情绪的讨论摘录时，这种影响更加明显。与STEM专业不同，非STEM领域的学生表现出不对称和悲观的信仰变化，表明他们可能感受到新兴AI技术的影响更强。对于未来收入的悲观信仰更新也普遍存在于各个性别和GPA水平之间，这表明所有学生群体都存在广泛的AI担忧。教育工作者、管理者和政策制定者可以定期与学生互动以解决他们的担忧，并改进教育课程，使他们更好地准备未来，这个未来必然会被AI改变。",
