    "translated_abstract": "基于拍卖的联邦学习（AFL）因通过经济手段激励数据拥有者加入FL而受到广泛的研究兴趣。现有工作假设在AFL市场上仅存在一个数据消费者和多个数据拥有者（即垄断市场）。因此，数据拥有者竞标加入数据消费者进行FL。但是，在实际的AFL市场中，多个数据消费者可能会竞争以吸引数据拥有者加入他们各自的FL任务，这种假设是不现实的。本文提出了一种首个效用最大化竞标策略（Fed-Bidder），使多个FL数据消费者可以通过AFL有效而高效地竞争数据拥有者，并提供了能够容纳不同市场动态的各种获胜函数的效用估计能力。基于六个常用基准数据集的广泛实验表明了策略的有效性和可扩展性。",
