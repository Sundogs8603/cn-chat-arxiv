Existing state-of-the-art methods are often unable to capture meaningful uncertainty in challenging or ambiguous scenes, and as such can cause critical errors in high-performance applications. In this paper, we explore a class of distributional instance segmentation models using latent codes that can model uncertainty over plausible hypotheses of object masks. For robotic picking applications, we propose a confidence mask method to achieve the high precision necessary in industrial use cases. We show that our method can significantly reduce critical errors in robotic systems, including our newly released dataset of ambiguous scenes in a robotic application. On a real-world apparel-picking robot, our method significantly reduces double pick errors while maintaining high performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "目标识别和实例分割是任何机器人或自主系统中的基本技能。现有的最先进方法通常无法捕捉具有挑战性或模糊的场景中的有意义的不确定性，因此可能会在高性能应用程序中导致关键错误。本文探讨了一类使用隐变量的分布式实例分割模型，可以对对象掩模的可行假设建模，从而模拟不确定性。对于机器人拾取应用程序，我们提出一种置信度掩模方法，以实现工业应用案例所需的高精度。我们展示了我们的方法可以显著减少机器人系统中的关键错误，包括我们新发布的模糊场景数据集。在现实世界的服装拾取机器人上，我们的方法显著减少了双重拾取错误，同时保持高性能。",
