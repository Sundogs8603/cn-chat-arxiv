    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）已经展示出在自然语言理解和生成方面的令人瞩目能力。然而，它们在更深入地理解用户和改善个性化推荐平台体验方面的潜力还远未被发挥。本文旨在填补这一空白。我们提出了使用LLMs对用户兴趣进行建模的方法，并定义了兴趣旅程作为用户基于他们的活动而遍历过的兴趣状态序列。我们的实验证明，相对于传统的用户表示方法，我们提出的方法可以提高推荐的质量，并且生成的兴趣旅程为推荐过程提供了可解释性和新颖性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method for modeling user interests using large language models (LLMs) and defines interest journeys as a sequence of interest states that users traverse through based on their activities. The proposed method improves recommendation quality and provides interpretability and novelty to the recommendation process."
