    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度生成模型推动的基于结构的药物设计备受瞩目。 语言模型已经展示了在二维结构中生成有效分子的强大能力，而基于几何深度学习的方法则可以直接产生具有准确三维坐标的分子。受这两种方法的启发，本文提出了一种基于口袋的三维分子生成方法，该方法利用语言模型具有生成三维坐标的能力。 由于高质量的蛋白质-配体复合物数据不足，因此设计了一种扰动和恢复预训练任务，可以利用大量的小分子数据。 还提出了一种新的分子表示形式，即带有局部和全局坐标的基于片段的SMILES，使语言模型能够有效地学习分子拓扑结构和空间位置信息。最终，CrossDocked和DUD-E数据集被用于评估和衡量。",
