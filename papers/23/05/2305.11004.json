    "translated_abstract": "最近，分类法的完善任务--自动利用新的概念丰富现有分类法--已经引起了广泛的兴趣。早期的研究引入了复杂模块、外部信息和伪叶来丰富表示并统一附加和插入的匹配过程。虽然它们已经取得了良好的性能，但这些介绍可能会在训练和评分过程中带来噪音和不公平性。在本文中，我们提出了TaxBox，一种新颖的用于完成分类法的框架，它将分类法概念映射到框嵌入中，并使用两个概率评分器来进行概念附加和插入，避免使用伪叶。具体而言，TaxBox由三个组件组成：（1）图聚合模块，以利用分类法的结构信息和两个轻量级解码器，将特征映射到框嵌入，并捕捉概念之间的复杂关系；（2）两个概率评分器，分别对应附加和插入任务，设计了一种原则性方法来减轻误导信息的影响；（3）一种联合训练模型和优化两个评分器的训练算法。我们在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，TaxBox在准确性和训练效率方面显著优于现有的状态-of-the-art方法。",
