    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose methods for discovering semantic differences in words appearing in two corpora based on the norms of contextualized word vectors. The key idea is that the coverage of meanings is reflected in the norm of its mean word vector. The proposed methods do not require the assumptions concerning words and corpora for comparison that the previous methods do. All they require are to compute the mean vector of contextualized word vectors and its norm for each word type. Nevertheless, they are (i) robust for the skew in corpus size; (ii) capable of detecting semantic differences in infrequent words; and (iii) effective in pinpointing word instances that have a meaning missing in one of the two corpora for comparison. We show these advantages for native and non-native English corpora and also for historical corpora.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于语境化词向量规范的方法，在两个语料库中发现出现的单词之间的语义差异。其核心思想是通过其平均词向量的规范来反映其意义的覆盖范围。所提出的方法不需要与以前的方法所需的关于对比单词和语料库的假设。它们所需要的是计算语境化词向量的平均向量及其对于每个单词类型的规范。然而，它们是(i) 对于语料库大小的偏斜具有鲁棒性; (ii) 能够检测切入单词的语义差异; (iii) 有效地指出在对比的两个语料库中缺失某个含义的单词实例。我们展示了对本土和非本土英语语料库以及历史语料库的优势。",
