This paper leverages constrained monotonic neural networks to model each competing survival distribution. This modelling choice ensures the exact likelihood maximisation at a reduced computational cost by using automatic differentiation.

    "translated_abstract": "生存分析是一种处理患者因未经历感兴趣事件而出现的“censoring”的时间至事件模型。机器学习算法在此类问题中表现突出，但往往忽略了竞争风险对感兴趣事件的影响，从而导致生存率估计存在偏差。本文提出了一种使用单调约束神经网络模拟每种竞争生存率分布的方法，确保采用自动微分方法能够在计算成本下实现精确的最大似然值最优化。通过效果实验对比完成了一个合成数据和三个医学数据集的生存数据分析。最后讨论了在开发医疗实践风险评估指标时考虑竞争风险的意义。",
