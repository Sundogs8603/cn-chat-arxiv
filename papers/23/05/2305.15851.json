    "translated_abstract": "确定性点过程(DPP) 最早被 Macchi 作为量子光学模型引入，自那以后，它们已广泛用作统计学和计算机科学中的模型和子抽样工具。大多数应用需要从DPP抽样，考虑到其量子起源，自然会想知道在量子计算机上抽样DPP是否比在经典计算机上更容易。本文关注于有限状态空间上的DPP，这是一个在$\\{1,\\dots,N\\}$子集上的分布，由一个$N\\times N$的Hermite内核矩阵参数化。最基本的采样包括两个步骤，在经典计算机上分别需要 $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ 和 $\\mathcal{O}(Nr^2)$ 的操作成本，其中$r$是内核矩阵的秩。本文旨在讨论量子计算机上的DPP采样算法的状态及其优化方式。",
