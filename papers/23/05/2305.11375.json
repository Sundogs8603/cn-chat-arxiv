    "abstract": "We find it is common for consumers who are not in financial distress to make credit card payments at or close to the minimum. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with economic factors but can be explained by minimum payment information presented to consumers acting as an anchor that weighs payments down. Building on Stewart (2009), we conduct a hypothetical credit card payment experiment to test an intervention to de-anchor payment choices. This intervention effectively stops consumers selecting payments at the contractual minimum. It also increases their average payments, as well as shifting the distribution of payments. By de-anchoring choices from the minimum, consumers increasingly choose the full payment amount - which potentially seems to act as a target payment for consumers. We innovate by linking the experimental responses to survey responses on financial distress and to actual credit card payment behaviours. We find that the intervention largely increases payments made by ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们发现，许多没有财务困境的消费者会选择支付或接近支付最低金额，这种模式难以用经济因素来解释，但可以通过给消费者呈现的最低付款信息作为锚定因素来解释。在Stewart（2009）的基础上，我们进行了一个假设的信用卡支付实验，以测试去除锚定效应的干预措施。这种干预措施有效地防止消费者选择合同最低支付金额。它还提高了他们的平均付款水平，并改变了付款分布。通过去除最低支付金额的锚定，消费者日益倾向于选择全额付款-这可能成为消费者的目标付款。我们的创新在于将实验响应与调查响应和实际信用卡付款行为相链接。我们发现，这种干预措施大大提高了消费者的付款水平。",
