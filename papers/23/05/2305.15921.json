    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的基于逻辑的学习方法，从正负例中，使用给定的背景知识生成假设为基础的论证框架(Assumption-based Argumentation, ABA)，这些ABA框架可以映射到具有失败否定的逻辑程序，这些程序也可以是非流纹理的。现有的基于论证的方法通过将例外事项解释为反驳攻击来学习一般规则的例外情况，而我们的方法将其解释为扰动攻击。我们的学习技术基于使用转换规则，包括一些改编自逻辑程序转换规则（特别是折叠）以及其他规则，例如逐字学习和假设引入。我们提出了一个通用策略，按照适当的顺序应用转换规则来学习流纹理框架，我们也提出了一种处理非流纹理情况的变体。我们通过许多例子说明我们方法的优点，这些例子表明，我们既能够学习与提供的正负例相对应的ABA框架，又能够比现有方法产生的框架具有更好的预测精度。",
