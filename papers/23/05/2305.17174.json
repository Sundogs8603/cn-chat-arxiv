    "abstract": "Dogwhistles are coded expressions that simultaneously convey one meaning to a broad audience and a second one, often hateful or provocative, to a narrow in-group; they are deployed to evade both political repercussions and algorithmic content moderation. For example, in the sentence 'we need to end the cosmopolitan experiment,' the word 'cosmopolitan' likely means 'worldly' to many, but secretly means 'Jewish' to a select few. We present the first large-scale computational investigation of dogwhistles. We develop a typology of dogwhistles, curate the largest-to-date glossary of over 300 dogwhistles with rich contextual information and examples, and analyze their usage in historical U.S. politicians' speeches. We then assess whether a large language model (GPT-3) can identify dogwhistles and their meanings, and find that GPT-3's performance varies widely across types of dogwhistles and targeted groups. Finally, we show that harmful content containing dogwhistles avoids toxicity detectio",

    "translated_abstract": "犬哨是一种编码表达方式，它同时向广大观众传达一层含义，向一个狭窄的内部群体传达第二层意味，这通常是令人憎恶或挑衅的；它们旨在回避政治后果和算法内容调节。本文首次开展了对犬哨现象的大规模计算研究。我们开发了犬哨的分类法，策划了有着丰富背景信息和实例的迄今为止最大的犬哨词汇表，并分析了它们在美国历史政治家的演讲中的使用。然后，我们评估了一个大型语言模型（GPT-3）是否可以识别犬哨及其意义，并发现GPT-3性能因犬哨类型和目标群体而变化。最后，我们展示了包含犬哨的有害内容如何规避毒性检测。",
