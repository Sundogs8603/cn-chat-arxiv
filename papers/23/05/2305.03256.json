    "abstract": "Existing data-to-text generation efforts mainly focus on generating a coherent text from non-linguistic input data, such as tables and attribute-value pairs, but overlook that different application scenarios may require texts of different styles. Inspired by this, we define a new task, namely stylized data-to-text generation, whose aim is to generate coherent text for the given non-linguistic data according to a specific style. This task is non-trivial, due to three challenges: the logic of the generated text, unstructured style reference, and biased training samples. To address these challenges, we propose a novel stylized data-to-text generation model, named StyleD2T, comprising three components: logic planning-enhanced data embedding, mask-based style embedding, and unbiased stylized text generation. In the first component, we introduce a graph-guided logic planner for attribute organization to ensure the logic of generated text. In the second component, we devise feature-level mask",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的数据文本生成主要集中于从非语言输入数据（例如表格和属性值对）生成连贯的文本，但忽视了不同应用场景可能需要不同风格的文本。因此，我们提出了一个新的任务，即风格化数据文本生成，其任务是根据特定风格为给定的非语言数据生成连贯的文本。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种名为StyleD2T的新颖模型，包括三个组件：逻辑规划增强的数据嵌入、基于掩码的风格嵌入和非偏置式风格化文本生成。",
