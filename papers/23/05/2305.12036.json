    "translated_abstract": "图像对齐和图像修复是经典的计算机视觉任务。然而，仍缺乏足够的数据集来训练和评估端到端深度学习模型。获取用于图像对齐的基准数据需要精细的运动结构方法或光流系统，通常只提供大量的图像对应关系，而在基础图像序列中仅引入少量的场景变化。而替代方法则利用现有图像数据上的随机透视扭曲。然而，这只提供了平凡的扭曲，缺乏真实场景的复杂性和变化性。相反，我们提出的数据增强方法通过使用3D渲染来克服数据缺乏的问题：将图像添加为平面的纹理，然后添加不同的光照条件、阴影和遮挡到场景中。场景从多个视角渲染，提供了多样化的图像集，其中的对齐和/或退化得到了已知的基准数据，因此为图像对齐和修复任务提供了适当的训练和评估数据。",
    "tldr": "SIDAR是一种通过使用3D渲染生成多视角、多光照、多阴影、多遮挡等真实场景的方式来解决图像对齐和图像修复问题的数据增强方法。",
