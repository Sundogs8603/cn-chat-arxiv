    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习和统计学中，找到采样数据的平均值是一项基本任务。然而，在数据样本为图对象的情况下，定义平均值是一项困难的任务。我们提出了一个新颖的框架，通过在平滑图信号分布空间中嵌入图来定义图的平均值，其中可以使用Wasserstein度量衡量图相似性。通过在此嵌入空间中找到平均值，我们可以恢复保留结构信息的平均图。我们确定了新的图平均值的存在和唯一性，并提供了一个迭代算法来计算它。为了展示我们的框架作为机器学习中的一个有价值的工具，我们在各种任务中进行了评估，包括结构化图的k-means聚类、功能性脑网络的分类以及多层图的半监督节点分类。我们的实验结果表明，我们的方法实现了一致的p。",
