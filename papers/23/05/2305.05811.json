The framework involves specifying the features that the optimisation model should have and using a language model to generate an initial version of the model. The model is then tested and validated, and if it contains build errors, an automatic edition process is triggered. An experiment was performed using MiniZinc as the target language and two GPT-3.5 language models for generation and debugging. The results show that the use of language models for the generation of optimisation models is feasible, with some models satisfying the requested specifications, while others require further refinement. The study provides promising evidence for the use of language models in the modelling of optimisation problems and suggests avenues for future research.",
