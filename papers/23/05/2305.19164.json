    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种自动化算法，通过生成语言引导的对抗性测试图像（LANCE）来对训练过的视觉模型进行压力测试。我们的方法借鉴了最近语言建模和基于文本编辑的图像处理的进展，在不改变模型权重的情况下，用一套多样，逼真且具有挑战性的测试图像增加了一个IID测试集合。我们在我们生成的数据上对多种预训练模型的性能进行了基准测试，并观察到了显著而一致的性能下降。我们进一步分析了模型对不同类型编辑的敏感性，并展示了其在揭示ImageNet中先前未知的类别层次模型偏差方面的适用性。代码可在https://github.com/virajprabhu/lance找到。",
