    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了大学生们对于生成式人工智能（GenAI）技术在高等教育中的感知，聚焦于熟悉程度、参与意愿、潜在益处和挑战以及有效整合等方面。一项调查显示，在香港来自不同学科的399名本科生和研究生中，学生们普遍持积极态度，认为GenAI在教学和学习中有潜力提供个性化学习支持、写作和头脑风暴帮助以及研究分析能力。然而，也有人表达了有关准确性、隐私、伦理问题以及对个人发展、职业前景和社会价值的影响的担忧。根据John Biggs的3P模型，学生的感知对学习方法和结果有重要影响。通过理解学生的观点，教育工作者和政策制定者可以量身定制GenAI技术以满足需求和关注点，同时促进有效学习。",
