VQA is helpful to a visually impaired person, can be used for the security surveillance system and online chatbots that learn from the web. It uses NLP methods to learn the semantic of the question and to derive the textual features. Computer vision techniques are used for generating image representation in such a way that they can identify the objects about which question is asked. The Attention model tries to mimic the human behavior of giving attention to a different region of an image according to our understanding of its context. This paper critically examines and reviews methods of VQA algorithm such as generation of semantics of text, identification of objects and answer classification techniques that use the co-attention approach.",
