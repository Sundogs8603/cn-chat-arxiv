    "abstract": "Equity protection swaps (EPS) is a new type of superannuation insurance products base on swap structure. It has some developments on total return swaps (TRS) and is reminiscent of the insurance products known as registered index-linked annuities (RILA). The EPS buyer needs to share gains with EPS provider if the value of underlying reference portfolio increases and obtain protection if there is a loss. The EPS structure consists of two parts, a protection leg and a fee leg, with different participation rates negotiated by both EPS provider and buyer. We present a general pricing formula for standard EPS and obtain the corresponding static hedging strategy by using European options. To attract more investors, EPS provider are able to select an appropriate participation rate of fee leg in relation to the required protection level and levies no additional fee on investors. We also present numerical examples to illustrate.",

    "translated_abstract": "股权保护掉期（EPS）是一种基于掉期结构的超级养老金新型保险产品。它在总回报掉期（TRS）上有所发展，并且令人想起已知的保险产品注册指数联系年金（RILA）。如果参考组合的价值增加，EPS买方需要与EPS提供方共享收益，如果出现亏损则获得保护。 EPS结构由保护腿和费用腿两部分组成，由EPS提供方和买方协商不同参与率。我们提出了标准EPS的一般定价公式，并通过使用欧式期权获得相应的静态对冲策略。为了吸引更多投资者，EPS提供方可以选择一个与所需保护水平相关的适当参与费用率，并且不对投资者征收额外费用。我们还提供了数字实例以说明。",
