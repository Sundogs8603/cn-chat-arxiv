    "translated_abstract": "虽然一些强大的神经网络架构（例如Transformer、图神经网络）通过高阶项依赖建模在序列推荐中实现了改进的性能，但它们可能在标签稀缺情况下表现出较差的表征能力。为了解决标签不足的问题，对比学习（CL）已经引起了近期的关注，通过嵌入对比来进行自我监督的数据增强。然而，由于其对比视图生成策略的手工制定特性，现有的CL增强模型不仅难以在不同的序列推荐任务中产生一致的性能，还可能对用户行为数据噪声不具有鲁棒性。鉴于这一点，我们提出了一种简单而有效的自适应全局信息提取的图遮盖自编码器增强的序列推荐系统（MAERec）来解决这个问题。它自然地避免了上述问题，得益于其独特的数据重构机制。具体而言，我们的模型使用基于图的注意力机制，暴露出带有遮盖的项目序列，使表示不仅利用本地顺序信息，还利用项目之间的全局相关性。我们在四个基准数据集上对我们的方法进行了广泛评估。实验结果表明，我们的模型在具有较少标记样本的情况下始终比最先进的序列推荐方法表现出更好的性能，而且对数据损坏和缺失情况具有鲁棒性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel Graph Masked AutoEncoder-enhanced sequential Recommender system (MAERec) for sequential recommendation with high-order item dependency modeling. The model exposes masked item sequences with a graph-based attention mechanism to leverage not only the local order information but also the global correlation among items. Experimental results show that MAERec outperforms state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods with a lower number of labeled samples and is robust to data corruption and missingness scenarios."
