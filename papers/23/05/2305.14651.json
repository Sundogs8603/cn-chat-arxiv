    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于嵌入的方法在利用多模态知识图谱（KG）嵌入的实体对齐方面取得了巨大成功。在本文中，我们从生成模型的角度研究了基于嵌入的实体对齐（EEA）。我们表明EEA是一个特殊的问题，其主要目标类似于典型生成模型中的目标，基于这个目标，我们从理论上证明了最近发展的基于生成对抗网络（GAN）的EEA方法的有效性。然后，我们揭示了他们不完整的目标限制了实体对齐和实体合成（即生成新实体）的能力。我们通过引入生成的EEA（abbr.，GEEA）框架和提出的互相变分自动编码器（M-VAE）作为生成模型来缓解这个问题。M-VAE可以将一个实体从一个KG转换到另一个KG，并从随机噪声向量生成新实体。我们通过理论分析和实证实验展示了GEEA的优势。",
