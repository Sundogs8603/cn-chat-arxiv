    "translated_abstract": "宣传是一种旨在影响公众舆论和心态以推广特定议程的沟通形式。随着社交媒体的崛起，宣传已经迅速传播，引发了对自动宣传检测系统的需求。大多数宣传检测工作都集中在高资源语言（如英语）上，几乎没有为低资源语言检测宣传做出努力。然而，在社交媒体交流中发现多种语言的混合现象是很常见的，这被称为码混。码混在同一文本中结合了不同的语言，这对于自动系统构成了挑战。考虑到这一点，我们在此提出了检测混合文本中宣传技术的新任务。为了支持这个任务，我们创建了一个包含1030个文本的语料库，这些文本在英语和罗马乌尔都进行了混合，并用20种宣传技巧进行了注释，我们已经公开了这个语料库。我们进行了一系列实验来对比不同的模型和特征集合在此任务上的表现。",
