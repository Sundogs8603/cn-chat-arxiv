    "translated_abstract": "本文研究对比学习方法和监督学习方法之间数据组织的差异，重点关注局部密集簇的概念。我们引入一个新的度量指标，相对局部密度（RLD），用于定量测量簇内的局部密度。我们提供了视觉示例，以突出局部密集簇和全局密集簇之间的区别。通过对比对比学习和监督学习形成的簇，我们发现对比学习生成具有局部密度而无全局密度的簇，而监督学习创建具有局部和全局密度的簇。我们进一步探讨了使用图卷积网络（GCN）分类器作为处理局部密集簇的线性分类器的替代方法。最后，我们利用t-SNE可视化来证明对比和监督学习方法产生的特征之间的差异。我们提出了未来的研究方向来结束本文。",
