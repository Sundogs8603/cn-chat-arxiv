    "translated_abstract": "多准则推荐系统现在在广泛的电子商务领域中利用多准则 (MC) 评分信息，而深度学习中的图神经网络 (GNN) 已经被广泛应用于各种推荐系统的开发中。在这种情况下，本文首次尝试使用GNN辅助设计MC推荐系统。具体而言，我们提出了一种新颖的标准偏好感知轻量图卷积方法(CPA-LGC),可以准确捕捉用户的标准偏好以及复杂高阶连接中的协作信号。本文在MC扩展图上构建了一个能够将用户-物品MC评分转换为扩展二分图的MC扩展图，再进一步将标准重要性编码到图卷积过程中，并引入了一种新的标准偏好感知聚合方法来将用户对不同标准的偏好合并到最终的推荐列表中。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel criteria preference-aware light graph convolution method for multi-criteria recommendation that captures both the criteria preference of users and the collaborative signal in complex high-order connectivities. It utilizes an MC expansion graph, encodes the criteria importance into the graph convolution process, and introduces a novel criteria preference-aware aggregation method; achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines."
