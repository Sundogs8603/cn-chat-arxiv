    "abstract": "We present an exact Bayesian inference method for discrete statistical models, which can find exact solutions to many discrete inference problems, even with infinite support and continuous priors. To express such models, we introduce a probabilistic programming language that supports discrete and continuous sampling, discrete observations, affine functions, (stochastic) branching, and conditioning on events. Our key tool is probability generating functions: they provide a compact closed-form representation of distributions that are definable by programs, thus enabling the exact computation of posterior probabilities, expectation, variance, and higher moments. Our inference method is provably correct, fully automated and uses automatic differentiation (specifically, Taylor polynomials), but does not require computer algebra. Our experiments show that its performance on a range of real-world examples is competitive with approximate Monte Carlo methods, while avoiding approximation errors",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种离散统计模型的精确贝叶斯推理方法，即使是对于无限支持和连续先验也可以找到准确的解决方案。为了表达这样的模型，我们引入了一种支持离散和连续采样、离散观测、仿射函数、（随机）分支和事件条件的概率编程语言。我们的关键工具是概率生成函数：它们提供了定义程序的分布的紧凑闭合形式表示，从而实现了后验概率、期望、方差和高阶矩的精确计算。我们的推理方法是可证明正确的、完全自动化的，使用自动微分（特别是泰勒多项式），但不需要计算机代数。我们的实验表明，它在一系列真实世界的例子中的性能与近似蒙特卡洛方法竞争，同时避免了近似误差。",
