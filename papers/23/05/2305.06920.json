    "abstract": "Identifying the underlying dynamics of physical systems can be challenging when only provided with observational data. In this work, we consider systems that can be modelled as first-order ordinary differential equations. By assuming a certain pseudo-Hamiltonian formulation, we are able to learn the analytic terms of internal dynamics even if the model is trained on data where the system is affected by unknown damping and external disturbances. In cases where it is difficult to find analytic terms for the disturbances, a hybrid model that uses a neural network to learn these can still accurately identify the dynamics of the system as if under ideal conditions. This makes the models applicable in situations where other system identification models fail. Furthermore, we propose to use a fourth-order symmetric integration scheme in the loss function and avoid actual integration in the training, and demonstrate on varied examples how this leads to increased performance on noisy data.",

    "translated_abstract": "当只有观测数据时，确定物理系统的基本动态可能具有挑战性。本文考虑可以建模为一阶常微分方程的系统。通过假设一定的伪哈密顿形式，即使模型在系统受到未知阻尼和外扰的数据上进行训练，我们也能够学习到内部动态的解析项。在难以找到扰动解析项的情况下，使用神经网络学习这些项的混合模型仍能够准确地识别出系统的动态，就像在理想情况下一样。这使得该模型适用于其他系统辨识模型无法处理的情况。此外，我们提出在损失函数中使用四阶对称积分方案，避免训练中的实际积分，并展示了在噪声数据上如何提高性能的各种示例。",
