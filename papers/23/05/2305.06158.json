    "abstract": "We present a new encoder-decoder generative network dubbed EdgeNet, which introduces a novel encoder-decoder framework for data-driven auction design in online e-commerce advertising. We break the neural auction paradigm of Generalized-Second-Price(GSP), and improve the utilization efficiency of data while ensuring the economic characteristics of the auction mechanism. Specifically, EdgeNet introduces a transformer-based encoder to better capture the mutual influence among different candidate advertisements. In contrast to GSP based neural auction model, we design an autoregressive decoder to better utilize the rich context information in online advertising auctions. EdgeNet is conceptually simple and easy to extend to the existing end-to-end neural auction framework. We validate the efficiency of EdgeNet on a wide range of e-commercial advertising auction, demonstrating its potential in improving user experience and platform revenue.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的编码器-解码器生成网络EdgeNet，引入了一种新颖的编码器-解码器框架，用于在线电子商务广告中数据驱动的拍卖设计。我们打破了广义次高价（GSP）的神经拍卖范式，提高了数据利用效率，同时确保了拍卖机制的经济特征。具体而言，EdgeNet引入了基于transformer的编码器来更好地捕捉不同广告间的相互作用。与基于GSP的神经拍卖模型相比，我们设计了一个自回归解码器，以更好地利用在线广告竞拍中的丰富上下文信息。EdgeNet在概念上简单易懂，并易于扩展到现有的端到端神经拍卖框架中。我们在广泛的电子商务广告竞拍中验证了EdgeNet的有效性，展示了其在提高用户体验和平台收入方面的潜力。",
