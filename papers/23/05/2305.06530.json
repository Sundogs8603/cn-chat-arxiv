    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has led to the proliferation of large pretrained language models. These models have been shown to yield good performance, using in-context learning, even on unseen tasks and languages. They have also been exposed as commercial APIs as a form of language-model-as-a-service, with great adoption. However, their performance on African languages is largely unknown. We present a preliminary analysis of commercial large language models on two tasks (machine translation and text classification) across eight African languages, spanning different language families and geographical areas. Our results suggest that commercial language models produce below-par performance on African languages. We also find that they perform better on text classification than machine translation. In general, our findings present a call-to-action to ensure African languages are well represented in commercial large language models, given their growing popularity.",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理领域最近的进展，促使了大型预训练语言模型的普及。这些模型通过上下文学习表现出良好的性能，即使在未知任务和语言上也能表现出良好的性能。它们也被作为一种语言模型服务的商业API所采用。然而，它们在非洲语种上的表现尚不明确。本文对跨越不同语言系和地理区域的八种非洲语言上的两项任务（机器翻译和文本分类）上商业大型语言模型进行了初步分析。我们的结果表明，商业语言模型在非洲语种上的性能略低。我们还发现它们在文本分类方面的表现更好。总体上，我们的研究呼吁确保非洲语言在商业大型语言模型中得到充分的重视，这也是非洲语种逐渐流行的原因。",
