    "translated_abstract": "鉴于语言模型预训练的巨大成本，优化算法的微小改进将会大大降低训练的时间和成本。Adam及其变种一直是最先进的，而更复杂的二阶（基于Hessian的）优化器往往会带来太多的每步开销。在这篇论文中，我们提出了Sophia，一种简单可扩展的二阶优化器，它使用轻量级估计的对角Hessian作为预调节器。更新步骤是梯度的移动平均值除以估计Hessian的移动平均值，然后进行元素级别的裁剪。裁剪控制了最坏情况下的更新大小，并控制了Hessian在轨迹上的非凸性和快速变化的负面影响。Sophia只在每几次迭代中估计对角Hessian，这几乎没有平均每步的时间和内存开销。在使用GPT m进行语言建模时，",
