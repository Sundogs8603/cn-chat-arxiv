    "translated_abstract": "类不平衡问题（CIP）是开发无偏机器学习（ML）模型进行预测的潜在挑战之一。CIP发生在两个或多个类之间的数据样本未等分布时。边界合成少数样本过采样技术（SMOTE）是一种用于通过过采样少数（有限）样本来平衡不平衡数据的方法。现有的边界SMOTE的潜在缺点是它侧重于位于边缘点的数据样本并更加关注极端观测值，最终限制了过采样后更多不同样本的创造，这几乎是大多数边界SMOTE的基于过采样策略的情况。因此，过采样后会发生边缘化。为了解决这些问题，在本文中，我们提出了一种混合过采样技术，通过结合边界SMOTE和生成对抗网络的力量来生成更多多样性数据。",
