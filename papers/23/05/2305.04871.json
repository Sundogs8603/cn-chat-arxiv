    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑去卷积问题，即从卷积处理的观测值 $\\mathbf{y}$ 中恢复潜在信号 $x(\\cdot)$，其中观测值 $\\mathbf{y}$ 可能对应于 $y$ 的一部分缺失，滤波器 $h$ 可能未知且噪声 $\\eta$ 可加性。当 $x$ 是连续时间信号时，我们采用高斯过程（GP）先验分布来解决这一问题，提出了一种闭合的贝叶斯非参数去卷积策略。我们首先分析了直接模型，以建立其良好定义的条件。然后，我们转向逆问题，研究了：（i）一些必要条件，使得贝叶斯去卷积计算有可能成立，以及（ii）在哪种程度上可以从数据中学习到滤波器 $h$，以及在盲去卷积情况下可以近似滤波器 $h$ 的程度。所提出的方法被称为高斯过程去卷积（GPDC），并与其他去卷积方法进行了比较。",
