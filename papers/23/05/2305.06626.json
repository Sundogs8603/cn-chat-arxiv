    "abstract": "Though majority vote among annotators is typically used for ground truth labels in natural language processing, annotator disagreement in tasks such as hate speech detection may reflect differences among group opinions, not noise. Thus, a crucial problem in hate speech detection is whether a statement is offensive to the demographic group that it targets, which may constitute a small fraction of the annotator pool. We construct a model that predicts individual annotator ratings on potentially offensive text and combines this information with the predicted target group of the text to model the opinions of target group members. We show gains across a range of metrics, including raising performance over the baseline by 22% at predicting individual annotators' ratings and 33% at predicting variance among annotators, which provides a method of measuring model uncertainty downstream. We find that annotators' ratings can be predicted using their demographic information and opinions on online ",

    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言处理中，虽然通常使用标注者的多数投票来确定标签，但在仇恨言论检测等主观任务中，标注者之间存在不一致性可能反映出群体观点的差异，而不是噪声。因此，仇恨言论检测的一个关键问题是一个语句是否冒犯了它所针对的人群，而这可能只占标注者池的一小部分。本文构建了一个模型，预测可能具有冒犯性文本上每个标注者的打分，并结合文本的预测目标群体来模拟目标群体成员的意见。我们展示了一系列的评估指标，包括提高了22％在预测每个标注者的打分上的性能，提高了33％在预测标注者之间方差上的性能，这提供了下游用来衡量模型不确定性的方法。我们发现可以使用标注者的人口统计信息和其在线意见来预测标注者的打分。",
