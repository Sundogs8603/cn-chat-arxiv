    "translated_abstract": "近年来，数据驱动气象预测模型（DDWP）取得了快速发展，展示了高度接近数值天气预报（NWP）模型的能力。快速、准确、低成本的DDWP预报使其在操作预报中的使用成为一个具有吸引力的选择，但是，在真正的操作环境中对DDWPs进行严格的评估仍然需要努力。DDWP通常使用ERA5重新分析数据进行训练和评估，但是DDWP仅在模拟中进行过测试，即使模拟质量很高，也无法完全准确地代表真实世界。在操作预报中安全地使用DDWP需要更加彻底的“真实世界”验证，以及对当前DDWP的训练和评估方式进行仔细的研究。值得问一下，例如，用于训练的重新分析数据集对真实世界的模拟效果如何？这对于气候公正和气象数据的不均匀可用性非常重要。",
