    "translated_abstract": "神经网络是一种非常通用的模型，能够学习多个变量之间的各种关系。其中一种关系在实践中非常有趣，即非线性系统的输入输出关系，具有多种应用。研究能够估计这种关系的模型是一门广泛的学科，具有许多理论和实际结果。神经网络非常通用，但存在多种特殊情况，包括卷积神经网络和循环神经网络，分别用于特定的应用，即图像和序列处理。我们提出了一个假设，即通过将频率信息纳入到通用网络结构中来调整其结构，应该可以得到一种专门适用于非线性系统辨识的网络。此外，我们还表明，从理论上讲，可以添加这种频率信息而不会损失通用性。我们称这种新结构为频率支持神经网络（FSNN），并在多个非线性动态系统辨识任务中展示了其优越性。",
