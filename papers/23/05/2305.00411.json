    "translated_abstract": "在全球范围内，冠心病是主要死亡原因之一。早期检测和诊断CHD可以提高患者预后和降低死亡率。本文提出了一种结合机器学习和图像处理技术的新框架，用于预测CHD的存在。该框架包括多个阶段，包括数据分析、使用ReliefF进行特征选择、基于3D CNN的分割、迁移学习进行特征提取、特征融合和分类以及Adagrad优化。提出框架的第一步是分析数据，以确定可能与CHD相关的模式和相关性。接下来，应用ReliefF特征选择来确定样本图像中最相关的特征。然后，使用基于3D CNN的分割技术来分割视盘和黄斑，这是CHD诊断的重要区域。使用迁移学习进行特征提取，从分割的图像中提取特征。然后将提取的特征进行融合，并使用支持向量机（SVM）进行分类。最后，使用Adagrad优化来微调SVM参数。",
