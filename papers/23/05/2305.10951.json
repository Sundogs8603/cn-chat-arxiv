    "abstract": "The performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems has advanced substantially in recent years, particularly for languages for which a large amount of transcribed speech is available. Unfortunately, for low-resource languages, such as minority languages, regional languages or dialects, ASR performance generally remains much lower. In this study, we investigate whether data augmentation techniques could help improve low-resource ASR performance, focusing on four typologically diverse minority languages or language variants (West Germanic: Gronings, West-Frisian; Malayo-Polynesian: Besemah, Nasal). For all four languages, we examine the use of self-training, where an ASR system trained with the available human-transcribed data is used to generate transcriptions, which are then combined with the original data to train a new ASR system. For Gronings, for which there was a pre-existing text-to-speech (TTS) system available, we also examined the use of TTS to generate ASR training ",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，自动语音识别（ASR）系统的性能取得了显著进展，特别是对于具有大量转录语音的语言而言。然而，对于低资源语言，如少数民族语言、地方语言或方言，ASR性能通常仍然较低。本研究探究了数据增强技术是否可以帮助提高低资源ASR性能，重点关注了四种语言或语言变体（日耳曼语系：格罗宁根语、西弗里西亚语；马来-波利尼西亚语系：贝瑟玛语、纳萨尔语）。对于这四种语言，我们研究了自训练的使用，在该方法中，使用训练集数据训练ASR系统，利用该系统生成的转录文本与原始训练数据结合，来训练新的ASR系统。对于已有文本到语音系统（TTS）的格罗宁根语，我们还研究了使用TTS来生成ASR训练数据的方法。",
