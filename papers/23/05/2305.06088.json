    "translated_abstract": "在构建新应用程序时，我们越来越需要重用和整合已有知识。然而，实际情况是，这些先前的知识几乎不可能直接重用。这在eHealth等领域尤其如此，这些领域已经付出了大量的努力来开发高质量的标准和参考本体，例如FHIR。本文提出了一种集成方法，称为iTelos，该方法支持数据和知识的重用，以构建可互操作的电子健康记录（iEHR）。关键思想是应用程序的数据级别和模式级别应该独立开发，从而在满足需要的前提下最大限度地灵活重用先前的知识，这些需求被规范化为能力查询。本文利用预先定义的目的来实现这种直觉，这个目的被用于驱动特定领域中基于目的的知识图谱（PD-KG）的开发。iTelos方法包括七个步骤，涉及目标的定义、要求的收集、现有标准和知识源的识别、异构数据到PD-KG的集成、PD-KG能力查询的注释、基于能力需求的推理机制的实现以及对iEHR模型与参考用例的验证。该方法已在eHealth领域实施，重用了几种标准和参考本体，包括FHIR和SNOMED-CT，并通过一个真实的案例研究进行了评估，显示出了在确保符合相关法规和质量标准的情况下，开发时间和成本的显著降低。",
