    "translated_abstract": "机器翻译中的最小贝叶斯风险（MBR）解码已经显示出是一种强大的替代束搜索解码的方法，尤其是与基于神经网络的效用函数相结合时。然而，MBR解码的性能严重依赖于从模型中采样的方法和数量。本文探讨了用于MBR解码的不同采样方法对性能的影响。我们评估了一些流行的采样方法，例如祖先采样，核采样和top-k采样。基于我们对它们局限性的认识，我们尝试了最近提出的epsilon采样方法，该方法通过修剪所有小于epsilon的标记，以确保样本中的每个标记获得公平的概率质量。通过广泛的人类评估，我们证明了基于epsilon采样的MBR解码显著优于不仅是束搜索解码，而且还优于所有其他已测试的采样方法的MBR解码。",
