    "translated_abstract": "对话分割是对话系统中的一个关键任务，可以更好地理解对话文本。尽管无监督对话分割方法取得了一些进展，但由于训练中缺乏明确的监督信号，它们的性能受到限制。此外，对话分割点的精确定义仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，增加了手动注释的难度。在本文中，我们通过使用基于文档的对话来提供对话分割点的可行定义，并发布了一个名为SuperDialseg的大规模监督数据集，其中包含9478个对话，基于两个流行的基于文档的对话语料库，并继承了它们的有用的对话相关注释。此外，我们还提供了一个含有18个模型的基准，涵盖了五个类别的对话分割任务，并附带几种适当的评估指标。实证研究表明，监督学习在对话分割任务中表现极其出色。",
