    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）已经大大推动了自然语言处理（NLP）领域的发展，为广泛应用提供了高度实用、任务无关的基础。LLMs 作为通用任务求解器的巨大潜力，促使人们将其用于特定领域，如医疗保健、金融和教育，并将其用作助手甚至替代特定领域的专家和工具。但是，将LLMs直接应用于特定领域中的复杂问题会遇到许多困难，包括领域数据的异质性、领域知识的复杂性、领域目标的独特性以及约束的多样性。为了填补这种差距，最近几年进行了急剧增加的研究和实践致力于大型语言模型的领域专门化，然而这方面的研究尚未被系统地总结。在这篇综述中，我们对LLMs的领域专门化进行了全面概述，包括动机、挑战、方法论和评估指标。此外，我们提供了一个特定领域任务和数据集的分类法，对现有的领域自适应和定制技术进行了详细比较，并广泛讨论了这一领域中的未解决问题和未来的发展方向。",
