    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习中，将数据的变化因素分离是一个基本概念，并且不同的研究人员以各种方式研究它，导致了众多的定义。尽管有许多经验研究，但我们仍需要更多的理论研究来充分理解去卷积的定义属性，以及不同的定义之间的关系。本文提出了一个存在的去卷积定义的范畴论元分析，将范畴论作为一个统一而严谨的框架。我们提出笛卡儿积和幺模积的概念应该构成去卷积的核心。有了这些核心概念，我们展示了处理（i）函数，（ii）等变映射，（iii）关系和（iv）随机映射的相似性和关键区别。总的来说，我们的范畴论元分析深化了我们对去卷积及其不同制定的理解，可以帮助研究人员在不同的定义之间进行导航，并选择最合适的定义。",
