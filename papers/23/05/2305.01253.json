    "abstract": "Generative agents that simulate human society show tremendous potential for further research and practical applications. Specifically, the generative agent architecture comprising several meticulously designed modules constitutes the most critical component. To facilitate progress in this research, this report presents our integrated perspective on comprehending generative agents through summarization, since we believe summarization is the most fundamental and indispensable capacity of generative agents manifested across diverse scenarios. We hope this report can provide insight into understanding the importance of summarization capacity in generative agents and motivate future research.",
