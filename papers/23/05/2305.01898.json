    "abstract": "The field of intelligent connected in modern vehicles continues to expand, and the functions of vehicles become more and more complex with the development of the times. This has also led to an increasing number of vehicle vulnerabilities and many safety issues. Therefore, it is particularly important to identify high-risk vehicle intelligent connected systems, because it can inform security personnel which systems are most vulnerable to attacks, allowing them to conduct more thorough inspections and tests. In this paper, we develop a new model for vehicle risk assessment by combining I-FAHP with FCA clustering: VSRQ model. We extract important indicators related to vehicle safety, use fuzzy cluster analys (FCA) combined with fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) to mine the vulnerable components of the vehicle intelligent connected system, and conduct priority testing on vulnerable components to reduce risks and ensure vehicle safety. We evaluate the model on OpenPilot and experiment",

    "translated_abstract": "随着车联网在现代汽车中的应用不断扩大，车辆功能也随着时代的发展变得越来越复杂。这也导致了越来越多的车辆漏洞和安全问题。因此，特别重要的是要识别高风险的车联网系统，因为它可以告诉安全人员哪个系统最容易受到攻击，让他们进行更彻底的检查和测试。在本文中，我们结合I-FAHP和FCA聚类开发了一个新的车辆安全风险评估模型：VSRQ模型。我们提取与车辆安全相关的重要指标，使用模糊聚类分析（FCA）和模糊层次分析过程（FAHP）挖掘车辆智能联接系统的易受攻击组件，并对易受攻击的组件进行优先测试，以降低风险并确保车辆安全。我们在OpenPilot上评估了模型并进行实验。",
