    "abstract": "Nowadays, more and more problems are dealing with data with one infinite continuous dimension: functional data. In this paper, we introduce the funLOCI algorithm which allows to identify functional local clusters or functional loci, i.e., subsets/groups of functions exhibiting similar behaviour across the same continuous subset of the domain. The definition of functional local clusters leverages ideas from multivariate and functional clustering and biclustering and it is based on an additive model which takes into account the shape of the curves. funLOCI is a three-step algorithm based on divisive hierarchical clustering. The use of dendrograms allows to visualize and to guide the searching procedure and the cutting thresholds selection. To deal with the large quantity of local clusters, an extra step is implemented to reduce the number of results to the minimum.",

    "translated_abstract": "如今，越来越多的问题涉及到具有一个无限连续维度的数据：功能数据。在本文中，我们介绍了 funLOCI 算法，它允许识别功能本地聚类或功能基因座，即表现出相似行为的函数子集/组在相同区间内的连续子集中。功能本地聚类的定义借鉴了多元和功能聚类以及双聚类的思想，并基于一个加法模型，考虑了曲线的形状。funLOCI 是一个基于分裂式分层聚类的三步算法。使用树状图可以可视化和指导搜索过程以及切割阈值的选择。为了处理大量的本地聚类，实现了额外的步骤以将结果数量降至最小。",
