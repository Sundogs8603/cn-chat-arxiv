    "abstract": "To study social, economic, and historical questions, researchers in the social sciences and humanities have started to use increasingly large unstructured textual datasets. While recent advances in NLP provide many tools to efficiently process such data, most existing approaches rely on generic solutions whose performance and suitability for domain-specific tasks is not well understood. This work presents an attempt to bridge this domain gap by exploring the use of modern Entity Linking approaches for the enrichment of museum collection data. We collect a dataset comprising of more than 1700 texts annotated with 7,510 mention-entity pairs, evaluate some off-the-shelf solutions in detail using this dataset and finally fine-tune a recent end-to-end EL model on this data. We show that our fine-tuned model significantly outperforms other approaches currently available in this domain and present a proof-of-concept use case of this model. We release our dataset and our best model.",

    "translated_abstract": "为研究社会、经济和历史问题，社会科学和人文学科研究人员开始使用越来越大的非结构化文本数据集。虽然自然语言处理的最近进展提供了许多有效处理这些数据的工具，但大多数现有方法依赖于不适用于领域特定任务的通用解决方案，其性能和适合性都不是很好评估。本文提出了一种尝试去填补领域差距的方法，通过探索使用现代实体链接方法来丰富博物馆藏品数据。我们收集了一个数据集，其中包含7,510对实体提及，共1700多个文本进行了注释，详细评估了一些现成的解决方案，并使用此数据对最近的端到端 EL 模型进行微调。我们展示了我们微调的模型明显优于目前此领域中其他可用的方法，并展示了该模型的概念验证用例，同时开放了我们的数据集和我们的最佳模型。",
