    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了多元区间风险价值（MRVaR）和多元区间协方差（MRCov）作为两个风险度量，并探讨了它们在风险管理中的良好特性。具体地，我们解释了这种基于区间的风险度量对于规制和投资目的的风险管理是合适的。 基于此，引入了多元区间相关矩阵（MRCorr）。为了提高分析的便利性，我们在多元（对数）椭圆分布族的上下文中推导出了MRVaR和MRCov的显式表达式。我们以行业中常用的分布，如正态、t分布、logistic分布、拉普拉斯分布和Pearson VII型分布为例进行了数值实验。作为一种应用，我们提出了基于区间的均值方差投资组合优选框架。我们根据股票回报的实际数据计算优化组合的基于区间的有效前沿。数值实验和有效前沿分析表明，所提出的基于范围的方法具有灵活性和计算效率，并且能够实现比传统方法更好的风险-收益权衡。",

It introduces the multivariate range correlation matrix (MRCorr) and applies range-based approach to optimal portfolio selection. Numerical examples and efficient frontier analysis show that the proposed range-based approach is flexible, computationally efficient, and capable of achieving better risk-return tradeoffs than traditional approaches."
