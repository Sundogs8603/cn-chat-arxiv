    "translated_abstract": "基于涂鸦注释的弱监督学习在遥感图像目标提取中引起了极大的兴趣，因为涂鸦具有描述曲折物体和手动标注成本低等优点。然而，涂鸦过于稀疏，难以识别对象结构和详细信息，在目标定位和边界描述方面带来了巨大的挑战。为了缓解这些问题，在本文中，我们构建了两种内部结构约束、变形一致性损失和可训练的主动轮廓损失，以及涂鸦约束，通过监督编码器-解码器网络的优化，而不引入任何基于先验线索的辅助模块或额外操作。全面的实验表明，我们的方法优于该领域中的五种最先进的算法。源代码可在 https://github.com/yitongli123/ISC-TE 上获得。",
