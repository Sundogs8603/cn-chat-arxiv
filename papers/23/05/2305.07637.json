    "abstract": "The Imaging Data Commons (IDC) is a cloud-based database that provides researchers with open access to cancer imaging data and tools for analysis, with the goal of facilitating collaboration in medical imaging research. However, querying the IDC database for cohort discovery and access to imaging data has a significant learning curve for researchers due to its complex and technical nature. We developed Text2Cohort, a large language model (LLM) based toolkit to facilitate natural language cohort discovery by translating user input into IDC database queries through prompt engineering and returning the query's response to the user. Furthermore, autocorrection is implemented to resolve syntax and semantic errors in queries by passing the errors back to the model for interpretation and correction. We evaluate Text2Cohort on 50 natural language user inputs ranging from information extraction to cohort discovery. The resulting queries and outputs were verified by two computer scientists to me",

    "translated_abstract": "影像数据共享平台(IDC)是一个基于云的数据库，为研究人员提供开放获取的癌症成像数据和分析工具，旨在促进医学成像研究中的协作。然而，由于其复杂和技术性质，查询IDC数据库以进行队列发现和访问成像数据对研究人员来说具有显著的学习曲线。我们开发了基于大语言模型（LLM）的Text2Cohort工具箱，通过提示工程将用户输入转化为IDC数据库查询，并将查询的响应返回给用户，以促进自然语言队列发现。此外，实现了自动校正以解决查询中的语法和语义错误，通过将错误传回模型进行解释和校正。我们对50个自然语言用户输入进行了Text2Cohort评估，范围从信息提取到队列发现。结果查询和输出由两位计算机科学家进行了确认。",
