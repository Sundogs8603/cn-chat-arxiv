Specifically, we characterize the map as a zero of an infinite-dimensional score-residual operator and derive a Newton-type method for iteratively constructing such a zero. We prove convergence of these iterations by invoking classical elliptic regularity theory for partial differential equations (PDE) and show that this construction enjoys rapid convergence, under smoothness assumptions on the target score.

    "translated_abstract": "概率测度的运输是统计学和机器学习中许多核心任务的基础，从变分推理到生成建模。一个典型的目标是将一个感兴趣的目标概率测度表示为通过学习的映射将一个易处理的原概率测度推向前面。我们提出了一种新的构建这样一个运输映射的方法，给出了评估目标分布分数的能力。具体而言，我们将该映射特征化为一个无穷维的分数残差算子的零，并推导出一种迭代构造这样一个零的牛顿类型方法。通过调用偏微分方程的经典椭圆正则性理论，我们证明了这些迭代的收敛性，并表明在目标分数光滑性假设下，这种构造具有快速收敛性。我们方法的一个关键元素是将基本的牛顿方法推广到无穷维算子，其他形式的无穷维算子已经出现在非线性 PDE 中。",
