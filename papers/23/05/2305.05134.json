    "abstract": "In the past several decades, the world's economy has become increasingly globalized. On the other hand, there are also ideas advocating the practice of ``buy local'', by which people buy locally produced goods and services rather than those produced farther away. In this paper, we establish a mathematical theory of real price that determines the optimal global versus local spending of an agent which achieves the agent's optimal tradeoff between spending and obtained utility. Our theory of real price depends on the asymptotic analysis of a Markov chain transition probability matrix related to the network of producers and consumers. We show that the real price of a product or service can be determined from the involved Markov chain matrix, and can be dramatically different from the product's label price. In particular, we show that the label prices of products and services are often not ``real'' or directly ``useful'': given two products offering the same myopic utility, the one with low",

    "translated_abstract": "过去几十年里，全球经济变得越来越全球化。另一方面，也有提倡“本地购”的理念，即人们购买本地生产的商品和服务而不是远离本地的那些。本文建立了一个数学理论，用于确定代理人的最优全球与本地支出，从而实现代理人在支出和获得效用之间的最优平衡。我们的真实价格理论依赖于与生产者和消费者网络相关的马尔可夫链转移概率矩阵的渐近分析。我们表明，产品或服务的真实价格可以从涉及的马尔可夫链矩阵中确定，并且可能与产品的标签价格显著不同。特别地，我们表明，产品和服务的标签价格通常不是“真实的”或直接“有用的”：如果提供相同的近视效用，价格更低的那个产品会更好。",
