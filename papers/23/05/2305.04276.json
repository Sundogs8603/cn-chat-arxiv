    "translated_abstract": "交互式图像分割（IIS）已经成为减少注释时间的一种有前途的技术。在IIS的预处理和后处理方面已经取得了重大进展，但互动模糊的关键问题，尤其是阻碍了分割质量的问题，尚未得到充分研究。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了AdaptiveClick——一个点击感知的Transformer，结合了自适应焦点损失，以解决注释不一致性，并提供了解决遮罩和像素级模糊的工具。据我们所知，AdaptiveClick是第一个基于Transformer的、针对IIS的遮罩自适应分割框架。我们方法的关键部分是Click感知遮罩自适应Transformer解码器（CAMD），它增强了点击和图像特征之间的交互作用。此外，AdaptiveClick在决策空间中使像素自适应区分难易样本，独立于它们不断变化的分布。",
