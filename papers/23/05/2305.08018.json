    "translated_title": "DRew：带延迟的动态重连消息传递",
    "translated_abstract": "已经证明，消息传递神经网络（MPNN）存在过度压缩现象，导致长程相互作用任务表现不佳。这主要归因于只在节点的相邻居之间进行局部消息传递。试图使图形“更连通”并且更适合长程任务的重连方法通常会失去基于图形距离提供的归纳偏差，因为它们会使远程节点在每一层中立即通信。在本文中，我们提出了一个框架，可应用于任何MPNN架构，以执行基于层的重连，以确保逐渐加密图形。我们还提出了一种延迟机制，它允许根据层和它们的相互距离在节点之间进行跳跃连接。我们在几个长程任务上验证了我们的方法，并表明其优于图形变换器和多跳MPNN。",
