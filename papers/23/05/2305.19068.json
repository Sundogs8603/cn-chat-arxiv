    "translated_abstract": "使用深度学习方法查询知识图，可以自然地利用推理和泛化能力来学习推断更好的答案。传统的神经复杂查询答案方法主要适用于以实体为中心的知识图。然而，在现实世界中，我们还需要对事件、状态和活动（即事件性或情况）进行逻辑推理，以将学习系统从I型推进到II型，正如Yoshua Bengio所提出的。从事件性为中心的知识图（EVKG）中进行逻辑查询可以自然地提供对此类直观和逻辑推理的参考。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一个新的框架，利用神经方法来回答基于EVKG的复杂逻辑查询，这可以满足传统的一阶逻辑约束，还可以满足有关事件性发生和顺序的隐含逻辑约束。",
