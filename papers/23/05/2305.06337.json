    "translated_abstract": "系统风险是一个快速发展的研究领域。传统的金融模型经常不能充分反映信用周期中的泡沫、危机和这些现象之间的转换。为了研究非常不可预测的事件，系统风险方法利用先进的数学和计算工具，如复杂系统、混沌理论和蒙特卡罗模拟。本文应用相对简单的数学形式提供了一个统一的框架来建模信用周期和系统风险评估。该提议的模型被详细分析，以评估它是否可以反映经济的非常不同的状态。基于这些结果，构建了衡量系统风险的措施，以提供关于系统稳定性的信息。然后将形式主义应用于描述完整的信用周期，并以从现实世界数量导出的参数的形式表达各阶段之间因果关系的解释。该框架可以用于模拟多个经济领域，给决策者提供信息，以便他们更好地处理风险。",
