    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了交通时间衍生品，这是一种基于道路行驶时间的非交易基础资产的金融衍生品。在交通领域，交通时间衍生品被提出作为一种更加基本的定价方法，因为它不仅考虑了交通状况的水平，而且考虑了其波动性。在金融市场中，交通时间衍生品被提出作为一种创新的对冲工具，可以对冲市场风险，特别是在加密市场和传统银行业经历了最近的压力后。本文涉及到了（a）引入此类衍生品的动机（即对对冲的要求），（b）潜在的市场，以及（c）产品设计和定价方案。定价方案是基于实时传感器捕获的行驶时间数据设计的，这些数据被建模为奥恩斯坦-乌伦贝克（Ornstein-Uhlenbeck）过程，更普遍地，是连续时间自回归移动平均（CARMA）模型。这种模型的校准是通过隐藏因子模型进行的，该模型描述了交通时间动态。",
