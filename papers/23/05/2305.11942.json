    "translated_abstract": "在线学习（OL）是一个在学术界和工业界日益受到关注的研究领域。OL的主要挑战之一是概念漂移的内在存在，概念漂移通常被定义为随时间而来的入站数据流的统计属性的不可预见性变化。目前的概念漂移检测器表现很好，即存在较低的假阴性率，但它们仍然倾向于在概念漂移检测中表现出较高的假阳性率。本文提出了OPTWIN，即“OPTimal WINdow”概念漂移检测器。OPTWIN使用滑动窗口方法分析数据流的子窗口，以更高的准确性和更低的假阳性率检测概念漂移。OPTWIN的实验评估显示它在假阳性和真阳性率之间达到了更好的平衡，优于现有的检测器。",

    "en_tdlr": "OPTWIN is a concept drift detector that uses a sliding sub-window method to achieve higher accuracy and lower false positives in detecting concept drifts in online learning. It outperforms state-of-the-art detectors in terms of the trade-off between false positives and true positives."
