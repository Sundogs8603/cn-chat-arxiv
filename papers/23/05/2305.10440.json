    "translated_abstract": "多播通信技术被广泛应用于高设备密度的无线环境中。传统无线网络架构难以灵活地获取和维护全局网络状态信息，并且不能快速响应网络状态变化，从而影响现有多播解决方案的吞吐量、延迟和其他QoS要求。因此，本文在软件定义无线网络（SDWN）环境中提出了一种基于多智能体深度强化学习（MADRL-MR）的新型组播路由方法。首先，采用SDWN技术，灵活配置网络，并以流量矩阵的形式获取网络状态信息，表示全局网络链路信息，如链路带宽、延迟和数据包丢失率。其次，将组播路由问题分解为多个子问题，并通过多智能体协作解决。为了使每个代理能够准确了解当前网络状态和学习本地策略，本文使用深度Q-网络（DQN）算法进行强化学习。仿真实验结果显示，所提出的方法可以显著提高多播路由的性能，同时保证网络的QoS性能。",
