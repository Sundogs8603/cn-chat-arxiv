    "abstract": "In this paper, we take a preliminary step towards solving the problem of causal discovery in knowledge tracing, i.e., finding the underlying causal relationship among different skills from real-world student response data. This problem is important since it can potentially help us understand the causal relationship between different skills without extensive A/B testing, which can potentially help educators to design better curricula according to skill prerequisite information. Specifically, we propose a conceptual solution, a novel causal gated recurrent unit (GRU) module in a modified deep knowledge tracing model, which uses i) a learnable permutation matrix for causal ordering among skills and ii) an optionally learnable lower-triangular matrix for causal structure among skills. We also detail how to learn the model parameters in an end-to-end, differentiable way. Our solution placed among the top entries in Task 3 of the NeurIPS 2022 Challenge on Causal Insights for Learning Paths i",

    "translated_abstract": "本文致力于解决知识追踪中的因果发现问题，即通过实际学生反应数据找到不同技能之间的潜在因果关系。该问题的重要性在于可以帮助我们了解不同技能之间的因果关系，而无需进行大量的A/B测试，这可以帮助教育工作者根据技能先决条件信息设计更好的课程。具体而言，我们提出了一个概念解决方案，在修改后的深度知识追踪模型中引入了一个新颖的因果门循环单元（GRU）模块，该模块使用了i）一个可学习的置换矩阵来确定技能间的因果顺序，和ii）一个可选可学习的下三角矩阵来表示技能间的因果结构。我们还详细介绍了如何以端到端、可微的方式学习模型参数。我们的解决方案在NeurIPS 2022关于学习路径因果洞察的挑战赛任务3中表现出色。",
