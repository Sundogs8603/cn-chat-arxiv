    "abstract": "Federated Learning is a distributed machine learning approach that enables geographically distributed data silos to collaboratively learn a joint machine learning model without sharing data. Most of the existing work operates on unstructured data, such as images or text, or on structured data assumed to be consistent across the different sites.

The field of data integration has developed many methods to address these challenges, including techniques for data exchange and query rewriting using declarative schema mappings, and for entity linkage. Therefore, we propose an architectural vision for an end-to-end Federated Learning and Integration system, incorporating the critical steps of data harmonization and data imputation, to spur further research on the intersection of data management information systems and machine learning.",

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是一种分布式机器学习方法，它可以使地理分布的数据集共同学习一个机器学习模型，而无需共享数据。然而，现有的大部分工作都是基于非结构化数据（如图像或文本），或者基于在不同的站点上具有一致结构的结构化数据。然而，实际情况是各站点具有不同的模式、数据格式、数据值和访问模式，因此需要数据集成方法来解决这些挑战，包括使用声明性模式映射进行数据交换和查询重写，以及实体连接等。因此，我们提出了一个集成了数据协调和数据填补等关键步骤的端到端联邦学习和集成系统的架构愿景，以促进数据管理信息系统和机器学习的交叉研究。",
