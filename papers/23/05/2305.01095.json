    "translated_abstract": "自适应巡航控制（ACC）系统的发展旨在通过自动调节车速来确保与前车安全距离，从而增强车辆的安全性和舒适性。然而，传统的ACC系统无法适应不断变化的驾驶条件和驾驶者的行为。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于LSTM的ACC系统，可以从以往的驾驶经验中学习，并实时地适应和预测新的情况。该模型是基于实际的高速公路高D数据集构建的，该数据集是利用装备有摄像头的无人机在德国高速公路上获取的。我们在侧面车道前车剪切并强制目标驾驶员减速的激进车道变化时评估了ACC系统。为此，将所提出的系统在模拟驾驶环境中进行了评估，并与馈送前人工神经网络（ANN）模型和模型预测控制（MPC）模型进行了比较。",
