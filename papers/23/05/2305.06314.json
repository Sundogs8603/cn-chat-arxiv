    "translated_abstract": "在精细程度为LoD3的级别上重建带有语义信息的三维建筑模型一直是一个长期存在的挑战。与基于网格的模型不同，这些模型需要具有完全的几何形状和外墙层次的物体语义信息。这种要求严格的语义三维重建的主要挑战在于可靠地在三维输入数据的外墙层次进行语义分割。我们提出了一种称为Scan2LoD3的新方法，通过改进外墙层次的语义三维分割来精确重建具有语义信息的LoD3建筑模型。为此，我们利用激光物理学和三维建筑模型的先验知识来概率地识别模型冲突。这些概率物理冲突提出了模型开口的位置：它们的最终语义和形状是通过融合冲突、三维点云和二维图像的多模态概率图的贝叶斯网络推断出来的。为了满足严格的LoD3要求，我们利用估计的形状在三维建筑先验中切割出开口，并从库中适配语义三维对象。",
