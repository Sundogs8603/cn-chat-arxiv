    "translated_abstract": "虽然图神经网络（GNN）在节点分类任务中取得了成功，但其性能严重依赖于每类具有足够标记节点的可用性。在现实情况下，不是所有类都有许多标记节点，模型可能需要分类新类别，使得手动标记变得困难。为了解决这个问题，GNN需要能够用有限数量的标记节点对节点进行分类，称为Few-shot节点分类。先前的基于剧集元学习的方法在Few-shot节点分类中取得了成功，但我们的发现表明仅有多样的训练元任务才能实现最佳性能。为了应对基于元学习的Few-shot学习的挑战，我们提出了一种新的方法，即任务等变图Few-shot学习（TEG）框架。我们的TEG框架通过利用图神经网络的等变性质来使模型学习可转移的任务适应策略。我们在各种Few-shot分类基准上展示了我们提出的方法的有效性，实现了最先进的性能。",
