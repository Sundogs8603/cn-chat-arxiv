    "translated_abstract": "饮食对于生活方式疾病的流行至关重要。精确而轻松的饮食记录是有效的饮食管理和卡路里限制的主要瓶颈之一。鉴于食品布局的视觉复杂性，从食品盘中检测出菜肴是一个具有挑战性的问题。我们提出了一个端到端的计算框架，用于饮食管理，从数据编译、标注和最先进的模型识别到其移动应用程序实现。作为一个案例研究，我们将该框架应用于印度食品盘的上下文中，这些食品盘以其复杂的呈现方式而著称，这给菜肴的自动检测带来了挑战。从最受欢迎的61道印度菜肴开始，我们通过对基于深度学习的物体检测架构进行比较分析，确定最先进的模型。我们首先进行了68005个盘子图像的精心编制，并进行了134814个手动菜肴注释的比较。我们首先比较了十种多标签分类的架构，以识别ResNet50-v2和EfficientDet D1两个模型的性能。",
