Specifically, we incorporate the risk-averse nature of participants and obtain a communication-efficient on-device performance, while relying on feedback from the Parameter Server (\\texttt{PS}). A client has to decide its transmission plan on when not to participate in FL. This is based on its intrinsic incentive, which is the value of the trained global model upon participation by this client. Poor updates not only plunge the performance of the global model with added communication cost but also propagate the loss in performance on other participating devices. We cast the relevance of local updates as \\emph{semantic information} for developing local transmission strategies, i.e., making a decision on when to ``not transmit\".

    "translated_abstract": "本文讨论了联邦学习中客户端选择问题，利用学习目标和本地参与者的激励制定目标导向通信问题。具体来说，我们考虑参与者的风险规避本质，通过来自参数服务器的反馈获得通信高效的设备性能。客户端必须基于它的内在激励进行传输计划，该激励是此客户端参与训练全局模型的价值。本地更新的相关性被视为开发本地传输策略的语义信息，即决定“不传输”的时间。设备使用有关PS状态的反馈，来发展其策略，以在不降低全局模型性能的情况下，减少通信成本。",
