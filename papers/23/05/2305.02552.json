    "translated_abstract": "区块链技术使得无需信任第三方即可进行点对点交易。以太坊和智能合约区块链的快速发展需要有良好设计的交易费机制(TFMs)，以分配有限的存储和计算资源。然而，现有的TFM研究必须考虑交易的等待时间，这对计算机安全和经济效率至关重要。本文将以太坊区块链和内存池的数据整合起来，探讨两种事件如何影响交易延迟。首先，我们应用回归断点设计(RDD)来研究Ethereum的最新重大升级——Merge的因果推理。我们的结果表明，Merge显著降低了长时间等待时间、网络负载和市场拥堵。此外，我们通过检查其他复合因素（例如审查和私人更改后的未观察到的延迟事务）来验证结果的稳健性。其次，我们通过使用二次数学模型来描述交易费竞标过程，研究了交易低估对等待时间和可能的垃圾邮件攻击的影响。我们的跨学科方法将计算机科学和经济学融合在一起，提供了TFMs等待时间决定因素的全面视角。我们的研究对于提高区块链系统的安全性和经济性能具有实际意义。",
