    "abstract": "arXiv:2305.12544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled the deployment of many generative NLP applications. At the same time, it has also led to a misleading public discourse that ``it's all been solved.'' Not surprisingly, this has, in turn, made many NLP researchers -- especially those at the beginning of their careers -- worry about what NLP research area they should focus on. Has it all been solved, or what remaining questions can we work on regardless of LLMs? To address this question, this paper compiles NLP research directions rich for exploration. We identify fourteen different research areas encompassing 45 research directions that require new research and are not directly solvable by LLMs. While we identify many research areas, many others exist; we do not cover areas currently addressed by LLMs, but where LLMs lag behind in performance or those focused on LLM development. We welcome suggestions for other research",

    "translated_title": "一切都已解决了吗？大型语言模型尚未解决的开放性自然语言处理研究问题",
    "translated_abstract": "近期大型语言模型(LLMs)的进展使得许多生成式自然语言处理应用得以部署。与此同时，这也导致了一个误导性的公众话语，“一切都已解决”。不足为奇的是，这反过来使得许多自然语言处理研究人员，特别是那些刚开始职业生涯的人，担心他们应该专注于哪些研究领域。一切都已解决了吗，或者不论大型语言模型(LLMs)如何，我们可以继续研究哪些问题？为了回答这个问题，本文整理了适合深入探究的自然语言处理研究方向。我们确定了包含45个研究方向的14个不需要大型语言模型直接解决的研究领域。虽然我们确定了许多研究领域，但还有许多其他领域存在；我们未涵盖目前由大型语言模型(LLMs)处理的领域，但在性能上落后或者专注于大型语言模型(LLM)发展的领域。我们欢迎对其他研究领域的建议。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了14个不由大型语言模型直接解决的自然语言处理研究领域，包含45个新的研究方向，为NLP研究人员提供了丰富的探索方向。",
