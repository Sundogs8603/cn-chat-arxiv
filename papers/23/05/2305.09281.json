    "abstract": "In this paper, we trace the biases in current natural language processing (NLP) models back to their origins in racism, sexism, and homophobia over the last 500 years. We review literature from critical race theory, gender studies, data ethics, and digital humanities studies, and summarize the origins of bias in NLP models from these social science perspective. We show how the causes of the biases in the NLP pipeline are rooted in social issues. Finally, we argue that the only way to fix the bias and unfairness in NLP is by addressing the social problems that caused them in the first place and by incorporating social sciences and social scientists in efforts to mitigate bias in NLP models. We provide actionable recommendations for the NLP research community to do so.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过追溯过去500年的种族主义、性别歧视和同性恋恐惧症，将当前自然语言处理（NLP）模型中的偏见追溯到它们的起源。我们从关键种族理论、性别研究、数据伦理和数字人文研究的文献中总结了偏见在NLP模型中的起源。我们展示了NLP中偏见的根本原因是社会问题。最后，我们认为解决NLP中的偏见和不公平的唯一方法是解决导致这些问题的社会问题，并将社会科学和社会科学家纳入减轻NLP模型偏见的努力中。我们提供了可实施的建议，供NLP研究界使用。",
