    "translated_abstract": "MLP参数化的符号距离函数是神经表面重建的常见组成部分。我们在成功的最新方法NeuS的基础上，通过三个新组件进行扩展。第一个组件是从EG3D中借用三平面表示法，将符号距离场表示为三平面和MLP的混合，而不是仅使用MLP来表示。使用三平面会导致更具表现力的数据结构，但也会引入重建表面中的噪声。第二个组件是使用一种新型的位置编码与可学习的权重来对抗重建过程中的噪声。我们将三平面中的特征分成多个频率尺度，并使用不同频率的正弦和余弦函数调制它们。第三个组件是在三平面特征上使用可学习的卷积操作，使用自注意力卷积产生具有不同频带的特征。实验表明，PET-NeuS比NeuS和其他现有的神经表面重建方法实现了更高质量的表面重建。",
