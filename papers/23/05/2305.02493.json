However, existing time-based frameworks can not handle complex traffic scenarios and ignore the motion tendency influence of each moving objects on the risk distribution, leading to performance degradation. To address this problem, we novelly propose a comprehensive driving risk management framework named RCP-RF based on potential field theory under Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) environment, where the pedestrian risk metric are combined into a unified road-vehicle driving risk management framework. Different from existing algorithms, the motion tendency between ego and obstacle cars and the pedestrian factor are legitimately considered in the proposed framework, which can improve the performance of the driving risk model. Moreover, it requires only O(N 2) of ",
