    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading reason behind cancer-related deaths within the world. Early detection of lung nodules is vital for increasing the survival rate of cancer patients. Traditionally, physicians should manually identify the world suspected of getting carcinoma. When developing these detection systems, the arbitrariness of lung nodules' shape, size, and texture could be a challenge. Many studies showed the applied of computer vision algorithms to accurate diagnosis and classification of lung nodules. A deep learning algorithm called the VGG16 was developed during this paper to help medical professionals diagnose and classify carcinoma nodules. VGG16 can classify medical images of carcinoma in malignant, benign, and healthy patients. This paper showed that nodule detection using this single neural network had 92.08% sensitivity, 91% accuracy, and an AUC of 93%.",

    "translated_abstract": "肺癌是全球癌症相关死亡率的主要原因。早期检测肺结节对于提高癌症患者的生存率至关重要。传统上，医生必须手动识别可能有肺癌的区域。在开发这些检测系统时，肺结节的形状、大小和质地的任意性是一个挑战。许多研究表明，计算机视觉算法在肺结节的准确诊断和分类方面有应用。本文开发了一种深度学习算法VGG16，以帮助医学专业人员诊断和分类肺癌结节。VGG16可将肺癌的医学图像分类为恶性、良性和健康患者。本文表明，使用此单个神经网络的结节检测具有92.08％的敏感性，91％的准确性和93％的AUC。",
