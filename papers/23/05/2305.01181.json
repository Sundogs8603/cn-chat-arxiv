    "abstract": "Machine Translation (MT) has made significant progress in recent years using deep learning, especially after the emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT. This brings new challenges and opportunities for MT using LLMs. In this paper, we brainstorm some interesting directions for MT using LLMs, including stylized MT, interactive MT, and Translation Memory-based MT, as well as a new evaluation paradigm using LLMs. We also discuss the privacy concerns in MT using LLMs and a basic privacy-preserving method to mitigate such risks. To illustrate the potential of our proposed directions, we present several examples for the new directions mentioned above, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed directions and highlight the opportunities and challenges for future research in MT using LLMs.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，机器翻译（MT）在深度学习的推动下取得了显著进展，特别是在GPT-3和ChatGPT等大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现后。这为使用LLMs的MT带来了新的挑战和机遇。本文提出了一些有趣的使用LLMs的MT方向，包括风格化MT、交互式MT和基于翻译记忆的MT，以及一种使用LLMs的新评估范例。同时，我们还讨论了使用LLMs的MT中的隐私问题，并提出了一种基本的隐私保护方法以减轻此类风险。为了说明我们提出的方法的潜力，我们给出了几个以上提到的新方向的示例，展示了所提出方向的可行性，并突出了使用LLMs的MT未来研究的机会和挑战。",
