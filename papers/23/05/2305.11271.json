    "translated_abstract": "协作任务通常始于双方拥有不完全的任务知识和不完整的初始计划。为完成这些任务，代理人需要与合作伙伴进行实地交流，并协调他们的部分计划以实现联合任务目标。虽然这种协作在人与人的团队中似乎轻而易举，但对于人工智能的协作来说却具有很高的挑战性。为解决这个问题，本文提出了一种协作计划获取的方法，其中人类和代理人努力学习并相互交流，以获取联合任务的完整计划。具体地，本文提出了一种新颖的问题，让代理人基于丰富的感知和对话历史，预测他们自己和合作伙伴缺失的任务知识。我们在一个三维方块世界的对称协作任务中扩展了一个情境对话基准，并研究了计划获取的计算策略。我们的实证结果表明，预测任务知识是计划获取过程中的重点。",
