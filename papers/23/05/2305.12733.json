    "translated_abstract": "使用图神经网络对多方对话进行建模已被证明能够有效地捕捉复杂和图形化的信息流动。然而，现有方法过多地依赖于必要的地址标签，并且只能应用于每个话语都必须标记有地址标签的理想情况。为了研究在多方对话中常见的地址标签稀缺问题，我们提出了MADNet，该方法在异构图神经网络中最大化地址推断期望值用于多方对话生成。在缺少少量地址标签的多方对话中，现有方法无法构建一个连贯的对话图，而只能形成几个独立的对话碎片。为了确保这些对话碎片之间的消息传递，我们设计了四种额外类型的潜在边以完成一个完全连接的图。此外，为了对那些没有地址标签的话语进行边类型相关的消息传递的优化，我们采用了期望最大化算法。",
