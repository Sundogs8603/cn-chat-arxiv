    "abstract": "The layout design of pipelines is a critical task in the construction industry. Currently, pipeline layout is designed manually by engineers, which is time-consuming and laborious. Automating and streamlining this process can reduce the burden on engineers and save time. In this paper, we propose a method for generating three-dimensional layout of pipelines based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Firstly, we abstract the geometric features of space to establish a training environment and define reward functions based on three constraints: pipeline length, elbow, and installation distance. Next, we collect data through interactions between the agent and the environment and train the DRL model. Finally, we use the well-trained DRL model to automatically design a single pipeline. Our results demonstrate that DRL models can complete the pipeline layout task in space in a much shorter time than traditional algorithms while ensuring high-quality layout outcomes.",
