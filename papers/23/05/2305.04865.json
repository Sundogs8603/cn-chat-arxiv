    "translated_abstract": "真实的信用风险评估、衡量交易对手违约造成的损失对于金融稳定至关重要。信用风险模型聚焦于借款人的财务状况，而对于其他来自于实体经济中的风险，尤其是供应链的风险，考虑较少。最近的大流行病、地缘政治不稳定以及自然灾害表明，供应链冲击确实会对大规模金融损失作出贡献。本文利用覆盖所有匈牙利公司供应链关系和银行贷款信息的独特微观数据集，估计公司破产如何影响供应链网络，导致可能出现额外的公司违约和金融损失。在多层网络框架内，我们为每个公司定义了一个金融系统风险指数(FSRI)，用于量化其自身和所有次级贷款因供应链网络(SCN)冲击传染而导致的预期金融损失。我们发现，供应链网络的传染引发的二级债务违约可能会导致能够影响金融稳定的金融系统风险指数整体上增加。",
