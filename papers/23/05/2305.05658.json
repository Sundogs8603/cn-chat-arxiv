    "translated_abstract": "为了使机器人能够有效个性化地提供物理辅助，它必须学习用户的个人喜好并将其应用于未来的场景中。本文研究了使用机器人进行家庭清扫的个性化问题，这些机器人能够通过捡起物品并将其放回原处来整理房间。一个关键的挑战是确定每个物品的正确位置，因为人们的喜好可以因个人品味或文化背景而大不相同。例如，一个人可能喜欢把衬衫放在抽屉里，而另一个人可能喜欢把衬衫放在架子上。我们旨在建立系统，这些系统可以通过与特定人的先前交互学习这样的喜好，而只需要几个示例。我们展示了机器人可以将基于语言的规划和感知与大型语言模型(LLMs)的少样本摘要能力相结合，从而推断出广泛适用于未来交互的用户偏好。这种方法实现了快速适应，并取得了91.2%的准确率。",
