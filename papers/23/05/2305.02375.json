    "translated_abstract": "在图像数据库上的机器学习任务通常会生成注释图像内容的掩模（例如显着性地图，分割地图），并且可以实现各种应用程序（例如确定模型是否学习了虚假关联，或者图像是否被恶意修改以误导模型）。尽管基于掩模属性检索示例的查询对实践者很有价值，但现有系统无法高效地支持此类查询。在本文中，我们正式确定了这个问题，并提出了一个系统MaskSearch，着重于加速对图像掩模数据库的查询。MaskSearch利用了一种新颖的索引技术和一种高效的过滤器验证查询执行框架。我们的原型在现实世界数据集上的实验表明，使用索引大小约为数据5%的MaskSearch可以将个体查询加速高达两个数量级，并且在模拟数据集探索的各种多查询工作负载上始终表现优异，优于现有方法。",
