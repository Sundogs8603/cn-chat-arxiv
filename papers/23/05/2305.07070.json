    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界中，大多数平台收集的反馈数据既有大规模、自然嘈杂的隐式反馈，也有小规模但高度相关的显式反馈。由于数据稀缺的问题，隐式反馈通常是训练推荐系统的默认选择，但这种数据可能非常嘈杂，因为用户行为的随机性和多样性。幸运的是，通过利用两种反馈的优势来弥补另一种的弱点，我们可以几乎不花费什么代价来缓解以上问题。本文提出了一个自动数据去噪的框架——AutoDenoise用于推荐系统，它使用少量显式数据作为验证集来指导推荐算法的训练。AutoDenoise受到课程学习（CL）的广义定义的启发，学会自动动态地进行课程学习，进而对数据进行去噪处理。",

By utilizing explicit data as the validation set to guide the training of the recommender algorithm, the framework can effectively denoise the implicit feedback data."
