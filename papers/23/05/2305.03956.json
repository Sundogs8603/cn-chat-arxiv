    "translated_abstract": "在城市地区，密集的建筑物经常会阻挡和反射全球定位系统（GPS）信号，导致接收到很多多径信号的少数可见卫星。这是一个严重的问题，会导致在城市地区位置不可靠。如果能够检测到来自某个卫星的信号接收状况，则可以通过排除或减轻多径污染的卫星信号来改善定位性能。因此，我们开发了一种使用双极化天线分类GPS信号接收状况的机器学习方法。我们使用决策树算法进行分类，其中三个特征之一只能从双极化天线中获得。使用从各种位置收集的GPS信号训练了机器学习模型。当输入从GPS原始信号提取的特征时，生成的机器学习模型会输出三种信号接收状况之一：非视距（NLOS）、视距（LOS）和部分可视（PLOS）。",
