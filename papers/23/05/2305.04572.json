Arguably, the time is ripe for a unification of these two fields, and for starting to take spoken language seriously as the primary mode of human communication.

    "translated_abstract": "人类语言首先是口语，其次才是书写语言。然而，文本是语言的一种非常方便和有效的表示方式，现代文明已将其普及。因此，NLP领域主要关注处理书面语言，很少关注口语。与此同时，口语处理则主要集中于独立的语音处理社区，在将语音转录为文本方面一直极为占优势。然而，深度学习的最新进展导致了语音处理和主流NLP方法之间的有利趋同。有人认为，现在是将这两个领域统一起来，认真对待口语作为人类主要交流方式的时候了。真正的自然语言处理可以带来与其他语言科学更好的整合，可以实现更高效、更像人类的系统，从而可以超越文本模式进行沟通。",
