    "translated_abstract": "动物演化出各种敏捷的运动策略，例如奔跑、跳跃和跳跃。目前越来越有兴趣研发像生物同样移动并展示各种敏捷技能以在复杂环境中快速导航的四脚机器人。尽管存在兴趣，但该领域缺乏系统基准来衡量控制策略和硬件在灵活性上的表现。我们引入了Barkour基准测试，这是一个用于量化四脚机器人敏捷性的障碍课程。受犬只敏捷竞赛的启发，它由不同的障碍物和基于时间的计分机制组成。这促使研究人员开发不仅移动快速而且以可控和多用途的方式行动的控制器。为了建立强有力的基线，我们提出了两种处理该基准测试的方法。在第一种方法中，我们使用基于策略的强化学习方法训练专业的运动技能，并将它们与高级导航控制器相结合。在第二种方法中，我们显示了一种优化方法，不需要显式地训练费用函数，同时实现了整个基准测试。",
