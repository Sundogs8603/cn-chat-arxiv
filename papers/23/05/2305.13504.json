    "translated_abstract": "针对自然语言处理开发的神经机器翻译（NMT）方法已被证明在自动翻译自然语言到另一种语言方面取得了巨大的成功。最近，这些NMT方法已被应用到程序代码的生成中。在NMT用于代码生成中，任务是生成满足输入中表达的约束条件的输出源代码。在文献中，已经探索了各种不同的输入情况，包括基于自然语言描述的代码生成，较低级别的表示，如二进制或汇编（神经反汇编），源代码的部分表示（代码完成和修复），以及另一种语言的源代码（代码翻译）。在本文中，我们对NMT用于代码生成的文献进行概述，按照输入和输出表示，模型架构，使用的优化技术，数据集和评估方法对已探索的方法进行分类。我们讨论NMT-based方法生成代码的现有限制和未来研究方向的前景。",
