    "translated_abstract": "在过去的20年中，语言学习和教学中的技术应用得到了显著发展，现在被称为计算机辅助语言学习（CALL）。最近，将人工智能（AI）整合到CALL中，显著改变了语言教育在课堂内外的传统方法。在本文中，我探讨了AI中介交流在语言教育中的优缺点。我首先简要回顾了教育中的AI技术。然后，我介绍了ICALL，并对AI驱动的自动语音识别（ASR）、机器翻译（MT）、智能辅导系统（ITSs）、AI驱动的聊天机器人和扩展现实（XR）的潜力进行了关键评估。最后，我认为，语言教师积极参与CALL教师教育和专业发展至关重要，以跟上不断发展的技术景观并提高自己的教学效果。",
