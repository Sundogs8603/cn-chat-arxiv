    "abstract": "We present a novel approach, in which we learn to cluster data directly from side information, in the form of a small set of pairwise examples. Unlike previous methods, with or without side information, we do not need to know the number of clusters, their centers or any kind of distance metric for similarity. Our method is able to divide the same data points in various ways dependant on the needs of a specific task, defined by the side information. Contrastingly, other work generally finds only the intrinsic, most obvious, clusters. Inspired by the mean shift algorithm, we implement our new clustering approach using a custom iterative neural network to create Differentiable Mean Shift (DMS), a state of the art, dataset agnostic, clustering method. We found that it was possible to train a strong cluster definition without enforcing a constraint that each cluster must be presented during training. DMS outperforms current methods in both the intrinsic and non-intrinsic dataset tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种新的聚类方法，通过少量成对样例的侧信息直接学习数据聚类。与以往方法不同，我们无需知道类别数、类中心或者任何相似的距离度量。该方法可以根据侧信息的任务需求将相同的数据点分成不同的聚类。受均值漂移算法启发，我们使用一种自定义的迭代神经网络来实现我们的聚类方法——Differentiable Mean Shift (DMS)，一种最先进的数据集无关聚类方法。我们发现可以训练一个强大的聚类定义，而不必强制要求每个簇在训练期间呈现。DMS在固有的和非固有的数据集任务上表现优异。",
