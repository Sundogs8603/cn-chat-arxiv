The MSK application was selected as the model problem due to its challenging nature in mapping the high-frequency surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to the low-frequency body joint motion controlled by the MSK and muscle contraction dynamics. The proposed method utilizes the fast wavelet transform to decompose the mixed frequency input sEMG and output joint motion signals into nested multi-resolution signals. The prediction model is subsequently trained on coarser-scale input-output signals using a gated recurrent unit (GRU), and then the trained parameters are transferred to the next level of training with finer-scale signals. These training processes are repeated recursively under a transfer-learning fashion until the full-scale training (i.e., with unfiltered signals) is achieved",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种多分辨率物理信息循环神经网络（MR PI-RNN），用于同时预测肌肉骨骼（MSK）运动和 MSK 系统参数的识别。由于高频表面肌电图（sEMG）信号与由 MSK 和肌肉收缩动力学控制的低频身体关节运动之间的映射的挑战性，因此选择了 MSK 应用作为模型问题。所提出方法利用快速小波变换将混合频率的输入 sEMG 和输出关节运动信号分解为嵌套的多分辨率信号。预测模型随后使用门控循环单元（GRU）在较粗的尺度输入-输出信号上进行训练，然后将训练好的参数转移到下一层细化的信号训练中。这些训练过程在转移学习的方式下递归地重复，直到完成全尺度训练（即使用未经滤波的信号）。",
