    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种新的脉冲神经网络模型，用于在无监督过程中从数据中学习分布式内部表示。我们通过将非脉冲前馈贝叶斯置信传播神经网络（BCPNN）模型转化为脉冲神经网络，并采用在线基于相关性的Hebbian-Bayesian学习和重连机制，该机制先前已表现出执行表示学习的能力。我们的脉冲模型采用泊松统计和低发火率与在体星形神经元相媲美。我们使用线性分类器评估了我们的脉冲模型学习的表示，并展示了与非脉冲BCPNN接近的性能，以及与其他基于Hebbian的脉冲网络在MNIST和F-MNIST机器学习基准测试中的竞争性能。",

The learned representations by the spiking model perform similarly to the non-spiking network and competitive with other Hebbian-based spiking networks on MNIST and F-MNIST benchmarks."
