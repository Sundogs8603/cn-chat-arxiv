    "translated_abstract": "最近发布的大型语言模型（LLM）如ChatGPT等在生成类似于人类的文本方面令人惊讶，但它们可能被用于制造虚假的学术文本、虚假新闻、虚假推特等。先前的作品提出了检测这些多尺度AI生成文本的方法，包括简单的ML分类器、基于预训练模型的训练不可知方法和精调的语言分类模型。然而，主流检测器在构建时没有考虑到文本长度的因素：短文本的缺乏信息特征，使其更难检测。针对多尺度文本检测的挑战，本文提出了一个多尺度正负样本（MPU）训练框架。首先，我们承认短的机器文本具有类人属性，并将文本分类重新表述为一个正负样本问题，即通过在训练期间标记这些短的机器文本为\"unlabeled\"来解决这个问题。在这个正负样本的背景下，我们提出了",
