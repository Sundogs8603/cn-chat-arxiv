    "translated_abstract": "从自然语言文本自动生成业务流程模型是一种新兴方法，可避免手动创建形式化业务流程模型。为此，需要从文本流程描述中提取出流程实体（如参与者、活动、对象等）和它们之间的关系。一个高质量的带有文本流程描述的注释语料库(PET)已经出版，其伴随着一种基本的流程提取方法。然而，在其当前状态下，PET缺乏有关两个提及是否指代了相同或不同的流程实体的信息，这对于是否在目标模型中创建一个或两个建模元素的重要决策相对应。因此，例如，两个数据处理的提及是否意味着处理不同或相同的数据是不确定的。在本文中，我们通过聚类流程实体的提及来扩展PET数据集，并提出了一种新的基线技术流程提取方法，其中包含一个",
