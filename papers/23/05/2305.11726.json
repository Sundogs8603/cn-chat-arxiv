    "translated_abstract": "由于其解决具有复杂约束的高维问题的效率，无投影在线学习引起了越来越多的关注。然而，大多数现有的无投影在线方法都集中在最小化静态遗憾上，这很不幸地无法捕捉到变化环境的挑战。在本文中，我们研究了非平稳的无投影在线学习，并选择动态遗憾和自适应遗憾来衡量性能。具体而言，我们首先为现有的名为$ \\text {BOGD} _ \\text {IP} $的无投影在线方法提供了一种新的动态遗憾分析，并建立了一个$ \\mathcal {O}（T ^ {3/4}（1 + P_T））$的动态遗憾上限，其中$ P_T $表示比较器序列的路径长度。然后，我们通过并行运行多个具有不同步长的$ \\text {BOGD} _ \\text {IP} $算法，并实时跟踪最佳算法，将上限改进为$ \\mathcal {O}（T ^ {3/4}（1 + P_T）^ {1/4}）$。我们的结果是投影-free在线学习方法的第一个一般情况的动态遗憾边界。最后，我们将我们的方法扩展到自适应遗憾，它容忍比较器序列和损失函数的动态变化。我们的方法实现了$ \\mathcal {O}（T ^ {2/3}（1 + P_T）^ {1/ 3}）$的自适应遗憾界限，几乎与下限相匹配，最多只相差一个对数因子。",
