    "translated_abstract": "基于振动的状态监测系统由于捕获宽频范围内的动态特征而受到越来越多的关注，能够准确地识别不同的状态。然而，在振动数据中聚类方法的研究还很少，所得到的解决方案通常只针对单个数据集进行优化。在本研究中，我们对来自于振动数据集时间和频域的统计特征采用了K均值聚类、OPTICS和高斯混合模型聚类（GMM）进行广泛的比较。此外，我们研究了特征组合、使用主成分分析（PCA）进行的特征选择以及指定数量的聚类对聚类算法性能的影响。我们使用三种不同的基准数据集通过网格搜索进行了比较。我们的研究表明，均值（平均值，中位数）和基于方差（标准差）的特征对于聚类振动数据非常关键，而PCA特征选择可以提高聚类性能。此外，我们发现GMM在准确性和稳定性方面优于K均值和OPTICS，但需要更多的计算资源。",
    "tldr": "本文通过比较K均值聚类、OPTICS和高斯混合模型聚类算法对振动数据集的统计特征进行聚类，发现平均值和方差类特征特别重要，PCA特征选择可以提高聚类性能，GMM是最优算法，但需要更多的计算资源。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper compares K-means clustering, OPTICS, and Gaussian mixture model clustering algorithms for clustering statistical features of vibration data sets, finding that mean and variance-based features are crucial with PCA feature selection improving performance, and that GMM outperforms the other algorithms in accuracy and stability, but requires more computational resources."
