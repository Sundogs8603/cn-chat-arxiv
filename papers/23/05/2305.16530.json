    "translated_abstract": "在模型验证中，量化物理系统感兴趣的量的不确定性是一个主要目标。然而，实现这一目标需要平衡计算效率和数值精度之间的需求。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的双保真度变分自编码器（BF-VAE）公式，旨在从物理系统中低、高保真度样本中估计与量感兴趣的量有关的不确定性。该模型通过利用从低保真度样本得出的信息来逼近高保真度量的统计信息。具体而言，我们设计了一个在潜在空间中的双保真度自回归模型，将其整合到VAE的概率编码-解码结构中。我们提出了一种有效的算法，以在存在有限高保真度数据的情况下，最大化高保真度对数似然的变分下界，从而以较低的计算成本合成高保真度的实现。此外，我们在各种数值示例中证明了我们方法的有效性，包括非线性随机系统和计算流体动力学模拟。",
