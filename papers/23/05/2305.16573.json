    "translated_abstract": "长尾数据中的识别问题最近变得越来越重要，因为数据集中每个类别的样本数量分布通常是指数分布，除非有意地调整样本数量。针对这些问题已经提出了各种方法。最近，提出了权重平衡方法，它结合了著名的经典正则化技术和两阶段训练。尽管其简单性，但已知其对现有各种不同方法具有高性能。然而，我们缺乏为什么这种方法对长尾数据有效的理解。在这项研究中，我们分析了该方法，并关注了神经崩溃和每个训练阶段的圆锥效应，并发现它可以分解为由权值衰减和交叉熵损失引起的特征提取器中Fisher判别比的增加以及由权重衰减和类平衡正则化引起的隐式逻辑调整。我们还证明了权重平衡方法成功缓解了神经崩溃和圆锥效应，从而提高了长尾数据的识别性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "The study examines the effectiveness of the weight-balancing method for long-tailed recognition problems, identifying its ability to alleviate neural collapse and cone effect, and improve recognition performance. The method increases Fisher's discriminant ratio and makes implicit logit adjustments through weight decay and class-balance regularization."
