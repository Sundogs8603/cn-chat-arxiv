    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型在许多领域和任务中展示了强大的能力，如上下文理解、代码生成、语言生成、数据叙述等，许多数据分析师可能担心他们的工作是否会被人工智能取代。这个有争议的话题引起了公众的极大关注。然而，我们仍处于意见分歧的阶段，没有任何明确的结论。基于此，我们在本研究中提出了“GPT-4是一个好的数据分析师吗？”的研究问题，并通过进行面对面的比较研究来回答这个问题。具体而言，我们将GPT-4视为一个数据分析师，使用来自各个领域的数据库进行端到端的数据分析。我们提出了一个框架来解决这些问题，通过精心设计GPT-4的提示语进行实验。我们还设计了几个任务特定的评估指标，以系统地比较几个专业人员之间的性能。",
