    "translated_abstract": "语言模型是分子设计的强大工具。当前主流的思路是将分子图形解析成线性字符串表示，从而易于训练。这种方法非常成功，但它仅限于可以完全通过图形表示的化学结构，如有机分子，而材料和生物分子结构如蛋白质结合位点需要更完整的表示方式，其中包括它们的原子在空间中的相对定位。在本研究中，我们展示了语言模型如何通过使用下一个令牌预测进行训练，不需要任何架构修改，就能够从各种基于化学结构的非常不同的分布中生成三维的新颖且有效的结构。特别是，我们证明了直接训练于从化学文件格式如XYZ文件、晶体学信息文件（CIF）或蛋白质数据库文件（PDB）派生的序列的语言模型可以直接生成三维结构。",
