    "translated_abstract": "这是一篇关于界面设计和人工智能的推测性论文。最近，基于大语言模型的聊天机器人受到了广泛关注，包括被报道的不良交互。我们认为问题的部分原因是文本并不是所有你需要的东西：复杂的AI系统应该有面板，就像所有其他复杂的设备一样。假设基于神经网络的AI系统将包含可解释的周围世界方面的模型，我们讨论这些面板可能显示的数据。我们推测，对于许多系统来说，最重要的模型将是用户模型和系统模型。我们称之为“系统模型”和“用户模型”。我们认为，为了可用性和安全性，面向基于对话的AI系统的界面应该具有基于系统模型和用户模型状态的并行显示。找到识别、解释和显示这两个模型的方法应该是界面研究的核心部分。",
