    "translated_abstract": "评估犬的心电图(ECG)需要熟练的兽医，但目前可用的兽医心脏病专家用于ECG解读和诊断支持的数量有限。开发自动评估ECG序列的工具可以通过提供临床医生实时结果和决策支持工具来改善兽医护理。我们实现了一个深度卷积神经网络(CNN)来将犬的心电图序列分类为正常或异常。将ECG记录转换为8秒的第二导联序列，根据是否存在一种或多种心脏异常将其分类为正常或异常。训练ECG序列使用RandomAugmentECG进行随机数据增强，这是一个专门为该项目实现的新增强库。然后，每个块使用连续小波变换转换成2D scalogram。2D scalogram使用二元CNN分类器分类成正常或异常。",
