    "translated_abstract": "周界控制通过控制不同区域之间的交通转移流量，以保证其交通密度低于临界值，从而保持受保护区域内交通高效。现有方法可以分为基于网络传输模型（NTMs）和宏观基本图（MFDs）的模型基方法和无模型方法。虽然基于模型的方法具有更高的数据效率和性能保证，但它们天生容易受到模型偏差和不准确性的影响。此外，现有研究中没有一项研究在微观模拟中使用强化学习进行同质流量优化，微观模拟考虑了空间特征、车辆级别信息和计量实现，这些在宏观模拟中经常被忽略。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的无模型周界控制框架。我们的框架使用交通信号控制代理与模拟车辆进行交互，学习如何优化信号时序以控制受保护区域的流入和流出。我们展示了基于DRL的方法在合成和真实交通情况下均能优于传统的基于模型的方法。",
