    "abstract": "Large-scale open-domain dialogue data crawled from public social media has greatly improved the performance of dialogue models. However, long-turn dialogues are still highly scarce. Specifically, most dialogue sessions in existing corpora have less than three turns. To alleviate this issue, we propose the Retrieve, Reorganize and Rescale framework (Re$^3$Dial), which can automatically construct a billion-scale long-turn dialogue corpus from existing short-turn dialogue data. Re$^3$Dial first trains an Unsupervised Dense Session Retriever (UDSR) to capture semantic and discourse relationships within multi-turn dialogues for retrieving relevant and coherent sessions. It then reorganizes the short-turn dialogues into long-turn sessions via recursively retrieving and selecting the consecutive sessions with our proposed diversity sampling strategy. Extensive evaluations on multiple multi-turn dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that Re$^3$Dial consistently and significantly improves the dialogu",
