    "translated_abstract": "在多个虚拟数字平台上运行的软件机器人必须理解平台的功能并像人类用户一样行事。平台的功能或特点因应用平台或生命周期而异，因此需要这些机器人具备适应性。此外，这些平台上的机器人可以与人类或其他软件代理合作工作或学习特定的行为模式。然而，除了语言处理和预测之外，现今的机器人，特别是聊天机器人，远未达到复杂商业信息系统内的人类用户行为水平。它们缺乏在这种虚拟环境中感知和行动的认知能力，使得它们的开发成为人工智能研究中的挑战。在这项研究中，我们提出问题并研究了构思软件机器人架构的假设，针对开发具有复杂认知能力的机器人的显著架构研究挑战进行了调查。",
