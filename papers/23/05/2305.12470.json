    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的机制来改善最近引入的图随机特征（GRFs）类的准确性。我们的方法通过施加抗生终止 - 一种采样更多样化的随机漫步的过程来诱导算法随机漫步长度之间的负相关性。它具有非常简单的实现。我们对这些拟随机数蒙特卡罗图随机特征（q-GRFs）的性质提供了强有力的理论保证，证明它们在温和条件下产生更低方差的2-正则化拉普拉斯核估计。值得注意的是，我们的结果适用于任何图形拓扑结构。我们展示了各种任务的经验准确度改进，包括新的实用应用程序：图扩散过程的时间有效逼近。据我们所知，q-GRFs是第一个对组合对象上定义的核进行严格研究的拟随机数蒙特卡罗方案，从而引发了关于图形的相关性的新研究。",
