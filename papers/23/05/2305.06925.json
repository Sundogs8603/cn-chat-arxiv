    "translated_abstract": "锂金属的性质是设计锂离子和锂金属电池的关键参数。由于锂的高反应性和低熔点以及锂在电池中存在于微观尺度下，很难在实验中进行探测。计算上，缺少能够在所有性质上一致且定量准确的经验势，而从头计算的成本又太高。本工作中，我们使用机器学习相互作用势 (MLIPs) 对密度泛函理论 (DFT) 数据进行训练，以在大长度和时间尺度下以状况-of-the-art 精度复现实验和从头计算的结果。我们准确预测热力学性质、声子光谱、弹性常数的温度依赖性以及各种表面性质，这些性质在 DFT 中无法获得。我们认为不同的 DFT 泛函存在微妙但显着的定量差异，影响了关键性质如表面能。通过 MLIPs 我们克服了这些缺点，实现了对锂金属的大尺度多尺度模拟，这是研究电池中锂金属必需的。",
