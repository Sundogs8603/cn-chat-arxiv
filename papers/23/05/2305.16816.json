    "abstract": "The development of general-domain neural machine translation (NMT) methods has advanced significantly in recent years, but the lack of naturalness and musical constraints in the outputs makes them unable to produce singable lyric translations. This paper bridges the singability quality gap by formalizing lyric translation into a constrained translation problem, converting theoretical guidance and practical techniques from translatology literature to prompt-driven NMT approaches, exploring better adaptation methods, and instantiating them to an English-Chinese lyric translation system. Our model achieves 99.85%, 99.00%, and 95.52% on length accuracy, rhyme accuracy, and word boundary recall. In our subjective evaluation, our model shows a 75% relative enhancement on overall quality, compared against naive fine-tuning (Code available at https://github.com/Sonata165/ControllableLyricTranslation).",

    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，通用领域的神经机器翻译（NMT）方法得到了显著发展，但是其输出的自然度和音乐约束的不足使它们无法产生可唱的歌词翻译。本文通过将歌词翻译形式化为受约束的翻译问题，将翻译学文献中的理论指导和实际技术转化为驱动的NMT方法，探索更好的适应方法，并将其实例化为一种英汉歌词翻译系统来填补可唱歌词翻译品质差距。我们的模型在长度准确性、韵律准确性和单词边界召回率方面分别达到了99.85%、99.00%和95.52%。在主观评估中，与朴素的微调相比，我们的模型在整体质量上表现出了75%的相对增强。",
