    "abstract": "In physics, I noticed subjects not explained by formulas were often not studied, like how uncontrolled growth systems changed form. Weather, businesses, societies, environments, communities, cultures, groups, relationships, lives, and livelihoods all do it following some variation of an 'S' curve. It is a slow-fast-slow process of self-animated contextual energy system development. Making working systems, they seem to develop by \"find and connect\" in three stages, starting small to first A) freely build designs of growing power, then B) diversify, adapt, respond, and harmonize with others, then C) take on one or more roles in their climax environments. It is a life curve of tremendous syntropic success that then ends with decline. Life is particularly risky for small start-ups, but many do succeed. Many powerful civilizations have emerged, some never growing up but growing as endless startups, only to become fragile, fail, and vanish. That looks like a choice.",

    "translated_abstract": "在物理学中，我发现那些无法用公式解释的现象往往被忽略，比如不受控制的生长系统如何改变形态。天气、企业、社会、环境、社区、文化、群体、人际关系、生活和生计等，都遵循某种变体的“S”曲线生长。这是一种自我激发的上下文能量系统发展的缓慢-快速-缓慢过程。它们似乎通过“发现和连接”在三个阶段中形成工作系统，首先A）自由地构建日益增长的能力，接着B）多样化、适应、响应和与其他系统和谐发展，最后C）在其顶点环境中承担一个或多个角色。这是一个巨大的系统熵成功的生命曲线，然后以衰退结束。对于小型初创企业而言，生存特别艰难，但许多企业确实成功了。许多强大的文明已经出现，有些永远不会成长，只会成为无尽的初创企业，最终变得脆弱、失败和消失。这看起来像是一个选择。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the emergent growth of self-organization and self-control in systems, which follows the \"S\" curve pattern of first freely building power, then harmonizing with other systems while developing, and finally taking on one or more roles in their climax environment before declining. Many small startups succeed, while some powerful civilizations eventually disappear."
