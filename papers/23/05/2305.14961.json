    "abstract": "The influx of deep learning (DL) techniques into the field of survival analysis in recent years, coupled with the increasing availability of high-dimensional omics data and unstructured data like images or text, has led to substantial methodological progress; for instance, learning from such high-dimensional or unstructured data. Numerous modern DL-based survival methods have been developed since the mid-2010s; however, they often address only a small subset of scenarios in the time-to-event data setting - e.g., single-risk right-censored survival tasks - and neglect to incorporate more complex (and common) settings. Partially, this is due to a lack of exchange between experts in the respective fields.  In this work, we provide a comprehensive systematic review of DL-based methods for time-to-event analysis, characterizing them according to both survival- and DL-related attributes.
