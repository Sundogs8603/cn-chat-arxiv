    "translated_abstract": "基于文献的发现（LBD）旨在通过挖掘论文并生成假设来发现新的科学知识。标准的LBD仅限于预测离散概念之间的两两关系（例如，药物和疾病的关联）。LBD还忽略了关键的上下文，例如实验设置（例如，药物评估的特定患者群体）和人类科学家考虑的背景知识和动机（例如，找到没有特定副作用的药物候选）。我们通过一种新颖的上下文化LBD（C-LBD）表述来解决这些局限性：以自然语言生成科学假设，同时将它们联系到控制假设搜索空间的上下文中。我们提出了一个建模框架，使用获得的引文和知识图关系的异构网络中的“灵感”，并创建了一个从论文中派生的新数据集。我们使用强大的大型语言模型（LLM）进行评估，发现GPT4倾向于生成具有创新性的思想。",
    "tldr": "本文介绍了一种基于文献的发现方法，通过上下文化的学习生成新的科学方向，克服了标准方法在预测关联、忽略上下文等方面的局限性。模型使用了引文和知识图关系的网络，并使用大型语言模型进行评估，发现GPT4在生成创新思想方面表现出色。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a literature-based discovery approach that generates novel scientific directions through contextualized learning, overcoming the limitations of standard methods in predicting associations and ignoring context. The model utilizes a network of citations and knowledge graph relations and is evaluated with a large language model, showing promising results in generating innovative ideas."
