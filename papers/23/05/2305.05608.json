    "translated_abstract": "在线平台在机会获取中起着重要作用：基于相关性的排名通过在招聘平台的工作职位、求职者或在线市场的卖家中分配曝光机会来创建和限制选项。为了负责任地这样做，这些社会相关系统采用各种公平措施和干预措施，其中许多措施试图根据价值分配曝光机会。但是，因为这些构造通常不是直接可观察的，所以平台必须使用代理评分，如相关性，并从搜索者的行为信号中推断出它们。然而，关键问题仍然存在，即相关性在高风险的公平排序中是否履行其作为价值评分这样的作用。本文结合社会学、信息检索和机器学习公平性的角度和工具，推导出相关性评分应满足的一组期望标准，以便有意义地指导公平干预措施。",
