    "abstract": "Aphasia is a language disorder that affects the speaking ability of millions of patients. This paper presents a new benchmark for Aphasia speech recognition and detection tasks using state-of-the-art speech recognition techniques with the AphsiaBank dataset. Specifically, we introduce two multi-task learning methods based on the CTC/Attention architecture to perform both tasks simultaneously. Our system achieves state-of-the-art speaker-level detection accuracy (97.3%), and a relative WER reduction of 11% for moderate Aphasia patients. In addition, we demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by applying it to another disordered speech database, the DementiaBank Pitt corpus. We will make our all-in-one recipes and pre-trained model publicly available to facilitate reproducibility. Our standardized data preprocessing pipeline and open-source recipes enable researchers to compare results directly, promoting progress in disordered speech processing.",

    "translated_abstract": "失语症是一种影响数以百万计患者讲话能力的语言障碍。本文利用AphsiaBank数据集采用最先进的语音识别技术提出了一种失语症语音识别和检测任务的新基准。具体而言，我们引入了两种基于CTC/Attention架构的多任务学习方法，同时执行两个任务。我们的系统实现了最先进的说话人级别检测准确率(97.3%)，并且相对WER降低了11%的中度失语症患者。此外，我们通过将其应用于另一个有语言障碍的语音数据库DementiaBank Pitt corpus，展示了我们方法的通用性。我们将公开发布我们的配方和预训练模型，以便于学术论文的复现。我们的标准化数据预处理流程和开源配方可使研究者直接比较结果，推动失语症语音处理的进步。",
