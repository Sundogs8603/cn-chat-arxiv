    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种创新的超分辨率方法来应对新型近场合成孔径雷达成像的需求，即将卷积神经网络扩展到电磁域，以实现对由雷达信号生成的图像进行超分辨率处理。具体来说，近场合成孔径雷达成像是通过在空间中扫描雷达来创建合成孔径来生成高分辨率图像的方法，其高保真度的空间感知能力、低成本设备和广泛的应用空间使其备受关注。由于SAR成像需要大的孔径尺寸才能实现高分辨率，因此超分辨率算法对于许多应用非常有价值。然而，基于自由手持智能手机SAR收集的不规则SAR孔径数据实现高效、高精度的SAR成像是有挑战的。为此，本文提出了两种基于卷积神经网络的超分辨率算法，用于实现高效且准确的近场SAR成像，与现有方法相比，这些算法在性能上具有卓越表现。第一种算法使用端到端网络直接将低分辨率SAR图像放大，而第二种算法则采用亚像素卷积层，在超分辨率过程中更好地保留图像细节。",
