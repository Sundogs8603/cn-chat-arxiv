    "translated_abstract": "生物学领域中不同类型微生物在生物学空间中发挥着重要作用，这些微生物之间的相互作用是微生物群落结构的基本构建单元。生物医学文本中的证据可作为预测这种相互作用的可靠来源。然而，阅读海量且不断增长的生物医学文献是一项耗时并令人望而生畏的工作。这就必然需要开发自动化方法来准确提取生物医学文献中所报道的细菌关系。本文介绍了一种从生物医学文献中自动提取微生物相互作用（特别是细菌之间）的方法以及使用迁移学习来提高其准确性的方法。我们还描述了一个管道，用于挖掘特定细菌群之间的关系。此外，我们还介绍了第一个公开可用的Bacterial Interaction (BactInt)语料库，其中包括1200篇PubMed摘要，注释有细菌间关系。",
