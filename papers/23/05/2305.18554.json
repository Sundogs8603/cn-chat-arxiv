Collectively, citing a diverse set of papers (in time and area of study) is an indicator of how widely the community is reading.

How has that changed over time, and what factors correlate with this citational attention/amnesia? We chose NLP as our domain of interest and analyzed approximately 71.5K papers to show and quantify several key trends in citation.

    "translated_abstract": "引用论文是现代科学写作讨论和建立先前工作的主要方法。全面地引用一组多样化(时间和研究领域)的论文是衡量社区阅读广泛程度的指标。然而，鲜有研究探讨引文的广泛时间模式。本研究系统地和实证地考察了自然语言处理领域内的引文重要性，探讨了我们引用论文时往回追溯多少年的问题，引用时间的变化趋势，以及有哪些因素与这种引文注意力/健忘状态相关。我们分析了约71.5K篇论文，选择了自然语言处理作为我们感兴趣的领域，并证明并量化了引用中的几个关键趋势。特别地，我们发现，大约62%的引用论文属于在出版前五年的论文，而只有约17%的论文超过十年。此外，我们发现引用论文的年龄中位数和年龄多样性从1990年到2014年持续增加，但自那时起，这个趋势已经逆转，目前自然语言处理论文的引文年龄还创历史最低点。",

The study finds that around 62% of the cited papers are within five years of publication, and only about 17% are more than ten years old. Currently, the citation age of NLP papers is at an all-time low, which is contrary to the previous trend."
