    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) attempts to train a global model by aggregating local models from distributed devices under the coordination of a central server. However, the existence of a large number of heterogeneous devices makes FL vulnerable to various attacks, especially the stealthy backdoor attack. Backdoor attack aims to trick a neural network to misclassify data to a target label by injecting specific triggers while keeping correct predictions on original training data. Existing works focus on client-side attacks which try to poison the global model by modifying the local datasets. In this work, we propose a new attack model for FL, namely Data-Agnostic Backdoor attack at the Server (DABS), where the server directly modifies the global model to backdoor an FL system. Extensive simulation results show that this attack scheme achieves a higher attack success rate compared with baseline methods while maintaining normal accuracy on the clean data.",

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）试图通过在中央服务器的协调下聚合来自分布式设备的局部模型来训练全局模型。然而，大量异构设备的存在使得FL容易受到各种攻击的影响，尤其是隐蔽的后门攻击。现有的作品侧重于客户端攻击，试图通过修改本地数据集来污染全局模型。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的FL攻击模型，即基于数据无关性的联邦学习服务器端后门攻击（DABS），其中服务器直接修改全局模型来实现FL系统的后门攻击。广泛的模拟结果表明，与基准方法相比，这种攻击方案在保持干净数据上的正常准确性的同时，实现了更高的攻击成功率。",
