    "translated_abstract": "在各种科学和工程领域中，对真实世界生物多智能体进行建模是一个基本问题。强化学习（RL）是在网络空间中生成灵活和多样化行为的强大框架；然而，在建模真实世界生物多智能体时，在源（即真实世界数据）和目标（即 RL 的网络空间）之间存在域差异，并且源环境参数通常是未知的。在本文中，我们提出了一种从多智能体场景的真实世界展示中进行 RL 的自适应行动监督的方法。我们采用结合 RL 和监督学习的方法，通过选择基于动态时间扭曲的演示动作来在 RL 中利用未知源动态的信息。这种方法可以轻松应用于许多现有的神经网络架构，并为我们提供一个在复制和推广之间平衡的 RL 模型。",
