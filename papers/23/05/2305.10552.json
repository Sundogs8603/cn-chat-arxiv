    "translated_abstract": "传统的监督学习任务要求对训练集中的每个实例进行标记，但在许多实际应用中，标记仅对实例的集合（包）可用。这种问题设置被称为多重示例学习（MIL），在医疗领域尤其相关，高分辨率图像被分成较小的补丁，但标签适用于整个图像。最近的MIL模型能够通过采用自我关注来捕捉补丁之间的对应关系，使它们能够根据包中所有其他补丁对每个补丁进行不同的加权。然而，这些方法仍然没有考虑较大图像中补丁之间的相对空间关系，这在计算病理学中尤为重要。为此，我们引入了一种新的MIL模型，具有距离感知自注意力（DAS-MIL），它在建模补丁之间的交互作用时明确考虑相对空间信息。与现有相关模型不同，DAS-MIL使用距离感知注意机制根据补丁之间的距离动态调整补丁权重，从而提高了在多个基准数据集上的分类性能。",
