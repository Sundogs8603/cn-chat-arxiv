    "translated_abstract": "本文调研了自动化科学发现，从方程式探索和符号回归到自主发现系统和代理。从“宏观”和上下文角度讨论了各种方法，但也讨论了开放问题和最近的话题，如深度神经网络在这个领域中的各种角色，帮助发现人类可解释的知识。此外，我们将介绍闭环科学发现系统，从Adam系统的开创性工作到当前在材料科学和天文学等领域的努力。最后，我们将从机器学习的角度详细阐述自主性，并以自动驾驶的自主级别为类比。最大级别，第五级，定义为在生产科学知识时不需要任何人类干预。实现这一点是迈向解决Nobel Turing Grand Challenge的一步：开发能够产生诺贝尔级科学成果的AI科学家 - 能力的一步。",
