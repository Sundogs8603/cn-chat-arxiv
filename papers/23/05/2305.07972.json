    "abstract": "Monetary policy pronouncements by Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are a major driver of financial market returns. We construct the largest tokenized and annotated dataset of FOMC speeches, meeting minutes, and press conference transcripts in order to understand how monetary policy influences financial markets. In this study, we develop a novel task of hawkish-dovish classification and benchmark various pre-trained language models on the proposed dataset. Using the best-performing model (RoBERTa-large), we construct a measure of monetary policy stance for the FOMC document release days. To evaluate the constructed measure, we study its impact on the treasury market, stock market, and macroeconomic indicators.

    "translated_abstract": "联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）的货币政策声明是金融市场回报的主要驱动因素。为了更好地了解货币政策如何影响金融市场，我们构建了FOMC演讲、会议记录和新闻发布会记录的最大化文本标注数据集。在本研究中，我们开发了一项新的任务 - “鹰派-鸽派”分类，并在提议的数据集上对各种预训练语言模型进行基准测试。使用效果最好的模型（RoBERTa-large），我们构建了FOMC文件发布日的货币政策立场指数。为了评估构建的指数，我们研究了它对国库市场、股票市场和宏观经济指标的影响。我们的数据集、模型和代码在Huggingface和GitHub上以CC BY-NC 4.0许可证公开提供。",
