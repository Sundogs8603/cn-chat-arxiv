    "abstract": "We examine the effects of an affirmative action policy at an elite Brazilian university that reserved 45 percent of admission slots for Black and low-income students. We find that marginally-admitted students who enrolled through the affirmative action tracks experienced a 14 percent increase in early-career earnings. But the adoption of affirmative action also caused a large decrease in earnings for the university's most highly-ranked students. We present evidence that the negative spillover effects on highly-ranked students' earnings were driven by both a reduction in human capital accumulation and a decline in the value of networking.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一项针对巴西一所精英大学45%招收黑人和低收入学生的平权政策的效应。我们发现，通过平权招生通道入学的边缘录取学生的早期职业收入增加了14%。但是，平权政策的实施也导致了该大学排名最高的学生收入大幅下降。我们提供证据表明，高排名学生收入的负面溢出效应既是由于人力资本积累的减少，也是由于社交网络价值的下降所导致的。",
