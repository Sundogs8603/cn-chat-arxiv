    "translated_abstract": "在部分标签学习（PLL）中，每个训练样本都与一组候选标签相关联，其中仅有一个是有效的。PLL的核心是消除候选标签中的歧义，以获得真实的标签。在消除歧义方面，现有的工作通常没有充分研究非候选标签集（也称为补充标签）的有效性，它准确地指示了一个不属于样本的标签集。在本文中，我们使用非候选标签来诱导一个补充分类器，它自然地形成对传统PLL分类器的对抗关系，以消除候选标签集中的误报标签。此外，我们假设特征空间和标签空间共享由动态图捕获的相同局部拓扑结构，并将其用于协助消除歧义。广泛的实验结果验证了该方法在4个控制UCI数据集和1个真实世界数据集上优于现有PLL方法。",
