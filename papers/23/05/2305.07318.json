    "translated_abstract": "拥堵收费的分配影响在文献中得到了广泛研究，证据各不相同。一些研究发现，定价是退步的，而其他研究则表明，它可以是渐进的或中立的，具体取决于城市地区的特定空间特征、现有活动和旅行模式以及定价方案的设计。此外，定价的福利和分配影响主要在客运方面进行研究，而货运方面得到的关注相对较少。本文采用一个大规模微模拟器（SimMobility），以人口和企业的行为决策、动态多模式网络性能及其相互作用为基础，整合考虑了几种第三最佳的拥堵收费方案对客运和货运的影响。通过对典型北美城市的模拟，分析各种因素对拥堵收费方案的影响。",
    "tldr": "本文基于代理人模型采用微观模拟评估了拥堵收费方案对旅客及货运的影响，分析了方案设计和城市空间特征的影响。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper uses agent-based microsimulation to evaluate the impacts of congestion pricing schemes on both passenger and freight transport. The study finds that the design of the pricing scheme and the spatial characteristics of the urban region have significant impacts on the distributional and welfare effects, and the effects on freight have been relatively understudied in the literature."
