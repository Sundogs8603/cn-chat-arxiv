    "translated_abstract": "信息检索在从大量数据中定位相关资源方面具有重要作用，其应用已从传统知识库发展至现代搜索引擎（SEs）。大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现进一步通过使用自然语言与搜索系统交互革命性地改变了该领域。本文探索了LLMs和SEs的优缺点，强调它们在理解用户查询和检索最新信息方面的各自优势。为了利用两种范例的优势并避免其限制，我们提出了InteR，这是一个通过SEs和LLMs之间的交互促进知识精炼的新框架。 InteR使SEs能够使用LLM生成的摘要来调整查询，同时使LLMs能够使用SE检索到的文档来增强提示。这种迭代的精炼过程增强了SEs和LLMs的输入，从而导致更准确的检索结果。",
