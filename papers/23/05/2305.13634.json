    "abstract": "The increasing maturity of big data applications has led to a proliferation of models targeting the same objectives within the same scenarios and datasets. However, selecting the most suitable model that considers model's features while taking specific requirements and constraints into account still poses a significant challenge. Existing methods have focused on worker-task assignments based on crowdsourcing, they neglect the scenario-dataset-model assignment problem. To address this challenge, a new problem named the Scenario-based Optimal Model Assignment (SOMA) problem is introduced and a novel framework entitled Scenario and Model Associative percepts (SMAP) is developed. SMAP is a heterogeneous information framework that can integrate various types of information to intelligently select a suitable dataset and allocate the optimal model for a specific scenario. To comprehensively evaluate models, a new score function that utilizes multi-head attention mechanisms is proposed. Moreov",

    "translated_abstract": "大数据应用日益成熟，导致同一场景和数据集中针对相同目标的模型数量不断增多。然而，选择最合适的模型，考虑到模型特征和特定要求和约束，仍然是一个重大挑战。现有方法偏重于基于众包的工人-任务分配，忽略了场景-数据集-模型分配问题。为了解决这个问题，引入了一个新的问题称为基于场景的最优模型分配（SOMA）问题，并开发了一种名为场景和模型联合感知（SMAP）的新框架。 SMAP是一种异构信息框架，可以集成各种类型的信息以智能地选择适当的数据集并为特定场景分配最佳模型。为了全面评估模型，提出了一个利用多头注意机制的新得分函数。此外，将SMAP与几种最先进的算法进行了比较，实验结果表明，SMAP在准确性和效率方面优于它们。",
