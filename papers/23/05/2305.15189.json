    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a method for table tennis ball trajectory filtering and prediction. Our gray-box approach builds on a physical model. At the same time, we use data to learn parameters of the dynamics model, of an extended Kalman filter, and of a neural model that infers the ball's initial condition. We demonstrate superior prediction performance of our approach over two black-box approaches, which are not supplied with physical prior knowledge. We demonstrate that initializing the spin from parameters of the ball launcher using a neural network drastically improves long-time prediction performance over estimating the spin purely from measured ball positions. An accurate prediction of the ball trajectory is crucial for successful returns. We therefore evaluate the return performance with a pneumatic artificial muscular robot and achieve a return rate of 29/30 (97.7%).",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种乒乓球轨迹过滤和预测方法。我们的灰盒子方法基于物理模型构建，并使用数据来学习动力学模型，扩展卡尔曼滤波器和神经模型的参数，以推断球的初始状态。与未考虑先验物理知识的两种黑盒子方法相比，我们的方法表现出卓越的预测性能。我们证明使用神经网络从球发射器的参数中初始化自旋，显着提高了长时间预测性能，相比仅从测量的球位置估计自旋。准确预测球的轨迹对于成功回球至关重要。因此，我们评估了一个充气人工肌肉机器人的回球性能，并实现了29/30（97.7％）的回球率。",
