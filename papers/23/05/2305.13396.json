    "translated_abstract": "婴儿会有意识地探究复杂的物理和社会环境。为了探寻内在动机如何帮助组织探究，我们创建了虚拟婴儿代理人并将其置于受启发的3D环境中，没有外部奖励。该环境有一个虚拟的照看代理人，能够与婴儿代理交互并以类似游戏的方式互动。我们测试了类似于推动人类探索的动机的内在奖励函数：惊奇，不确定性，新奇性和学习进度。这些通用的奖励函数引导婴儿代理人探索其环境，并发现内嵌在照看代理中的应变。代表新奇性和不确定性的奖励函数最成功地产生了多样的体验，并激活了环境中的应变。我们还发现，在存在一个关注且反应迅速的照看代理人的情况下学习世界模型可以更加高效和有效。",
