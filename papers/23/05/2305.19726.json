    "translated_abstract": "本文针对包含由不同的测量来源生成的多个视图的表格数据进行无监督表示学习。传统方法使用多视图框架解决此问题，但受到预定义的假设的限制，这些假设认为特征集共享相同的信息，表示应该学习全局共享的因素。然而，这种假设并不总是适用于复杂特征集之间存在的依赖关系的真实世界表格数据，这导致了较难学习的局部信息。为了克服这个限制，我们提出了一种数据驱动的方法，通过将特征集表示为图节点，将它们之间的关系作为可学习的边来学习特征集之间的依赖关系。此外，我们引入了一个新的分层图自编码器LEGATO，学习一个较小的潜在图来动态地整合多个视图的信息。这种方法产生了专门捕获局部信息的潜在图组件。",
