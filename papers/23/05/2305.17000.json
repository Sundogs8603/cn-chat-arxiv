    "translated_abstract": "对抗性攻击可能误导自动语音识别（ASR）系统，使其预测任意目标文本，从而构成明显的安全威胁。为了防止这种攻击，我们提出了DistriBlock，一种适用于任何ASR系统的高效检测策略，该系统在每个时间步骤上预测输出标记的概率分布。我们对该分布的一组特征进行测量：输出概率的中位数、最大值和最小值，分布的熵，以及与后续时间步骤的分布之间的Kullback-Leibler和Jensen-Shannon散度。然后，通过利用对良性和对抗性数据观察到的特征，我们应用二元分类器，包括简单的基于阈值的分类、这种分类器的集合以及神经网络。通过对不同最先进的ASR系统和语言数据集进行广泛分析，我们证明了DistriBlock在识别对抗性音频样本方面的有效性。",
