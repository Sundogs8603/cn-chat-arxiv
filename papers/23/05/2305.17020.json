    "translated_abstract": "目前的对话状态跟踪系统将完整的对话历史作为输入，将当前状态表示为包含所有槽的列表，并在每个对话回合中从头开始生成整个状态。这种方法效率低下，特别是当槽的数量很多且对话很长时。我们提出了Diable，一种新的任务形式化方法，简化了高效对话状态跟踪系统的设计和实现，并且可以轻松地嵌入大型语言模型。我们将对话状态表示为表格，并将对话状态跟踪形式化为表格操作任务。在每个回合中，系统通过基于对话上下文生成表格操作来更新先前的状态。在MultiWoz数据集上进行了大量实验，结果显示，Diable (i) 优于强大的高效对话状态跟踪基准，(ii) 时间效率比当前最先进的方法提高了2.4倍，同时保持竞争性的联合目标准确性，并且(iii) 对无噪声的输入具有鲁棒性。",
