    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于其良好的性能，深度多视角子空间聚类（DMVSC）引起了越来越多的关注。然而，现有的DMVSC方法仍存在两个问题：(1)它们主要依靠自编码器来非线性嵌入数据，而嵌入可能对于聚类来说是次优的，因为聚类目标很少考虑在自编码器中;(2)现有的方法通常具有二次或甚至三次复杂度，这使得处理大规模数据变得困难。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新颖的深度多视角子空间聚类方法，即锚图辅助的深度多视角子空间聚类（DMCAG）。具体而言，DMCAG首先独立地为每个视图学习嵌入特征，这些特征用于获取子空间表示。为了显著降低复杂性，我们为每个视图构建了一个具有小尺寸的锚图。然后，在一个综合锚图上执行谱聚类以获取伪标签。为了克服负面影响......",
