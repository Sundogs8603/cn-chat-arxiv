    "translated_abstract": "机器学习势能可以高效准确地近似描述BOPES（Born-Oppenheimer势能面），该势能决定了许多材料特性。模拟技术通常需要梯度，尤其是分子动力学中的力和应力以及热学输运中的热通量。最近开发的势能特征具有高的相互作用能量和包括通过消息传递机制的等变半局部相互作用。由于它们的复杂功能形式，它们依赖于自动微分（AD），从而克服了手动实现或有限差分方案来计算梯度的需要。这项研究展示了一种统一的AD方法，用于获取这种势能的力、应力和热通量，并提供了一种与模型无关的实现。该方法在Lennard-Jones势能上进行了测试，然后应用于使用等变mes模型预测锡硒化物的内聚特性和热导率。",
