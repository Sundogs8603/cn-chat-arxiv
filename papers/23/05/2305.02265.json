However, their performance drops drastically when confronted with linguistically complex texts that they struggle to comprehend. Inspired by the Divide-and-Conquer algorithm and dual-process theory, in this paper, we regard linguistically complex texts as compound proposition texts composed of multiple simple proposition sentences and propose an end-to-end Neural Divide-and-Conquer Reasoning framework, dubbed NDCR. It contains three main components: 1)Divide: a proposition generator divides the compound proposition text into simple proposition sentences and produces their corresponding representations, 2)Conquer: a pretrained VLMs-based visual-linguistic interactor achieves the interaction between decomposed proposition sentences and images, 3)Combine: a neural-symbolic reasoner combines the above reasoning states to obtain the final solution via a neural logic reasoning approach",

    "translated_abstract": "预训练视觉语言模型（VLMs）在图像检索方面取得了显着的性能。但是，当面对难以理解的语言复杂文本时，它们的性能会急剧下降。本文受到分治算法和双过程理论的启发，将语言复杂文本视为由多个简单命题句组成的复合命题文本，并提出了一个端到端的神经分治推理框架NDCR。它包括三个主要组件：1）分治：命题生成器将复合命题文本分为简单命题句，并生成它们的对应表示，2）征服：基于预训练视觉语言交互器实现分解命题句和图像之间的交互，3）组合：神经符号推理器采用神经逻辑推理方法将上述推理状态组合，获得最终解决方案。",
