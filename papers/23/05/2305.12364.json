    "abstract": "Socially responsible investors build investment portfolios intending to incite social and environmental advancement alongside a financial return. Although Mean-Variance (MV) models successfully generate the highest possible return based on an investor's risk tolerance, MV models do not make provisions for additional constraints relevant to socially responsible (SR) investors. In response to this problem, the MV model must consider Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores in optimisation. Based on the prominent MV model, this study implements portfolio optimisation for socially responsible investors. The amended MV model allows SR investors to enter markets with competitive SR portfolios despite facing a trade-off between their investment Sharpe Ratio and the average ESG score of the portfolio.",

    "translated_abstract": "社会责任投资者希望在获得财务回报的同时促进社会和环境进步来构建投资组合。虽然均值方差模型可以根据投资者的风险容忍度成功地生成最高可能的回报，但该模型并没有为社会责任投资者关注的附加限制提供规定。为解决这个问题，在突出均值方差模型的基础上，本研究实施了社会责任投资者的投资组合优化。改进后的均值方差模型允许社会责任投资者在市场上进入竞争性社会责任投资组合，尽管他们面临着投资夏普比率和投资组合的平均环境、社会和管治分数之间的权衡。",
