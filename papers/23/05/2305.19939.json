    "translated_abstract": "前列腺癌的早期诊断显著提高了患者5年生存率。图像引导下的活检可以改善对小型前列腺癌的检测。MRI-超声融合引导下的活检对更小的肿瘤敏感，但由于MRI和融合设备的高成本而被少使用。微型超声（微-US）是一种新型高分辨率超声技术，可提供MRI成像类似的诊断精度，同时成本更低。然而，由于癌细胞和正常组织之间的灰度变化微弱，因此解释微-US图像是具有挑战性的。可以通过向泌尿外科医生提供一个包含地面真实癌变区域的微-US图像大数据集来解决这个挑战。这样的数据集可以通过图像配准将手术标本（组织病理学）映射到微-US图像上。在本文中，我们提出了一个半自动化的流程，用于将体内微-US图像与离体全切片组织病理学图像配准。",
