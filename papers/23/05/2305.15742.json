    "abstract": "Estimating average causal effects is a common practice to test new treatments.

In this paper, we propose a novel conditional generative modeling approach to capture the whole counterfactual distribution, allowing efficient inference on certain statistics of the counterfactual distribution. This makes the proposed approach particularly suitable for healthcare and public policy making. Our generative modeling approach carefully tackles the distribution mismatch in the observed data and the targeted counterfactual distribution via a marginal structural model. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both synthetic and real data.",

    "translated_abstract": "估计平均因果效应是测试新疗法的常用做法。然而，平均效应会掩盖反事实分布中重要的个体特征，可能会引起安全、公平和道德方面的担忧。这个问题在时间设置中更加严重，因为处理是时序的和时变的，对反事实分布产生了错综复杂的影响。本文提出了一种新的条件生成建模方法，以捕获整个反事实分布，允许对反事实分布的某些统计量进行有效推断。这使得所提出的方法尤其适用于医疗保健和公共政策制定领域。我们的生成建模方法通过边际结构模型谨慎地解决了观察数据和目标反事实分布之间的分布不匹配。在合成和真实数据上，我们的方法优于现有的基线方法。",
