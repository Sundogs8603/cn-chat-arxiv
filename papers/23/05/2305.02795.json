    "translated_abstract": "伪标记是一种利用未标记数据信息的流行且有效方法。然而，传统的基于实例的伪标记方法通常根据其预测概率为每个未标记实例分配一个伪标签。由于真实标签数目未知，这些方法在半监督多标签学习（SSMLL）场景下难以很好地推广，因为它们会面临引入假正标签或忽略真正标签的风险。本文提出了一种面向SSMLL问题的类别分布感知伪标记（CAP）方法，鼓励伪标签的类别分布接近真实分布。具体而言，我们设计了一个包括类别感知阈值的正则化学习框架来控制每个类别的伪标签数目。鉴于标记和未标记的示例是根据同一分布采样的，我们通过利用标记示例的类别分布确定阈值并随着模型参数一起更新。在几个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，我们提出的方法在多标签分类性能方面显著优于现有的最先进方法。",
