    "abstract": "Credit Valuation Adjustment captures the difference in the value of derivative contracts when the counterparty default probability is taken into account. However, in the context of a network of contracts, the default probability of a direct counterparty can depend substantially on the default probabilities of indirect counterparties. We develop a model to clarify when and how these network effects matter for CVA, in particular in the presence of correlation among counterparties defaults. We provide an approximate analytical solution for the default probabilities. This solution allows for identifying conditions on key parameters such as network degree, leverage and correlation, where network effects yield large differences in CVA (e.g. above 50%), and thus relevant for practical applications. Moreover, we find evidence that network effects induce a multi-modal distribution of CVA values.",

    "translated_abstract": "信用估值调整涵盖了在考虑对手方违约概率的情况下衍生品合同价值的差异。但是，在合同网络的背景下，直接对手方的违约概率可能会极大地依赖于间接对手方的违约概率。我们开发了一个模型，以阐明这些网络效应何时和如何对CVA产生影响，特别是在对手方违约之间存在相关性的情况下。我们提供了近似的分析解，可用于确定关键参数（如网络度、杠杆和相关性）的条件，其中网络效应导致CVA的差异很大（例如大于50%），因此具有实际应用。此外，我们发现网络效应引发CVA价值的多模式分布。",
