    "abstract": "Common IR pipelines are typically cascade systems that may involve multiple rankers and/or fusion models to integrate different information step-by-step. In this paper, we propose a novel re-ranker named Fusion-in-T5 (FiT5), which integrates document text information, retrieval features, and global document information into a single unified model using templated-based input and global attention. Experiments on passage ranking benchmarks MS MARCO and TREC DL show that FiT5 significantly improves ranking performance over prior pipelines. Analyses find that through global attention, FiT5 is able to jointly utilize the ranking features via gradually attending to related documents, and thus improve the detection of subtle nuances between them.

    "translated_abstract": "常见的信息检索流程通常采用级联系统，可能涉及多个排名器和/或融合模型逐步整合不同的信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为Fusion-in-T5（FiT5）的新型重新排名器，它使用基于模板的输入和全局注意力将文档文本信息、检索特征和全局文档信息统一到一个单一的模型中。在MS MARCO和TREC DL的段落排名基准测试中，实验表明FiT5在先前的流水线性能上显著提高了排名表现。分析发现，通过全局注意力，FiT5能够逐渐关注相关文档，从而共同利用排名特征，改善检测它们之间微妙差别的能力。我们的代码将开源。",
