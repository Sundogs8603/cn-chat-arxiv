    "translated_abstract": "最近的大型语言模型如ChatGPT和GPT-4引起了人们的广泛关注，因为它们能够生成高质量的对话回应。尽管ChatGPT和GPT-4在通用文本语料库上经过了广泛的测试，展示了它们令人印象深刻的能力，但还没有对金融语料库进行研究。本研究旨在通过在零样本或少样本情况下考察ChatGPT和GPT-4作为典型金融文本分析问题求解器的潜力来弥补这一差距。具体而言，我们评估了它们在五个不同的金融文本数据集上进行的四项代表性任务的能力。初步研究表明，ChatGPT和GPT-4在需要领域特定知识的金融命名实体识别（NER）和情感分析等任务上表现不佳，而在数值推理任务上表现出色。我们报告了当前版本ChatGPT和GPT-4的优点和局限性，并将它们与现有技术进行了比较。",
