    "translated_abstract": "本文是首篇尝试使用差分隐私实现拓扑数据分析并生成接近最优的私有持久图。我们通过瓶颈距离分析持久图的灵敏度，发现常用的 \\v{C}ech 复形的灵敏度并不会随着样本量 $n$ 的增加而降低，这使得 \\v{C}ech 复形持久图难以隐私化。作为替代方法，我们提出使用 $L^1$-距离来计算持久图，发现其灵敏度为 $O(1/n)$。基于灵敏度分析，我们提出采用指数机制，其效用函数定义为 $L^1$-DTM 持久图的瓶颈距离。同时，我们还推导出了我们隐私机制的精度上下界；得到的界限表明我们的机制隐私误差接近最优。我们展示了我们的私有持久图方法的性能。",
