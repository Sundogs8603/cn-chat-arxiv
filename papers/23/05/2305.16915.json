    "abstract": "Trading pressure from one asset can move the price of another, a phenomenon referred to as cross impact. Using tick-by-tick data spanning 5 years for 500 assets listed in the United States, we identify the features that make cross-impact relevant to explain the variance of price returns. We show that price formation occurs endogenously within highly liquid assets. Then, trades in these assets influence the prices of less liquid correlated products, with an impact velocity constrained by their minimum trading frequency. We investigate the implications of such a multidimensional price formation mechanism on interest rate markets. We find that the 10-year bond future serves as the primary liquidity reservoir, influencing the prices of cash bonds and futures contracts within the interest rate curve. Such behaviour challenges the validity of the theory in Financial Economics that regards long-term rates as agents anticipations of future short term rates.",

    "translated_abstract": "一种资产的交易压力可能会影响另一种资产的价格，这种现象被称为交叉影响。本文使用跨越 5 年的 500 种美国上市资产的每秒数据，识别了使交叉影响相关的特征以解释价格回报方差。研究发现，价格形成是在高度流动性资产内自发发生的，然后这些资产的交易会影响较不流动但相关的产品价格，其影响速度受最低交易频率的限制。本文还探究了这种多维价格形成机制对利率市场的影响，发现 10 年期国债期货是主要的流动性储备，影响着利率曲线内现钞债券和期货合约的价格。这种行为挑战了财务经济学理论，该理论认为长期利率是代理人对未来短期利率的预期。",
