    "translated_abstract": "基于图神经网络（GNN）的聚类方法在节点聚类任务中取得了惊人的表现。然而，它们是基于同质图的假设设计的，而在异质图上进行聚类被忽视了。由于缺乏标签，不可能在找到适合的GNN模型之前首先将图形识别为同质或异质。因此，对于各种同质性水平的真实世界图形进行聚类将为图形研究社区带来新的挑战。为填补这一空白，我们提出了一种新颖的图形聚类方法，其中包含三个关键组件：图形重构、混合滤波器和双图形聚类网络。为了使其对图形无关，我们根据数据构建了高度同质性和异质性的两个图形。基于新图构建的混合滤波器提取了低频和高频信息。为了减少节点属性和拓扑结构之间的不良耦合，我们将它们分别映射到两个子空间中。",
