    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能在各个领域的普及，AI驱动的推理和训练过程中涉及可信度和透明度的问题引起关注，特别是涉及潜在偏差和可追溯性挑战的问题。虽然提出了区块链等分散化解决方案来解决这些问题，但它们在处理大规模模型时常常遇到挑战，导致推理耗时，训练验证低效。为了克服这些限制，我们介绍了BRAIN（基于区块链的可靠AI网络），这是一个特别设计的新平台，旨在确保大模型的可靠推理和训练。BRAIN利用独特的两阶段交易机制，通过分离请求和响应交易，允许实时处理通过流水线。每个随机选择的推理委员会都会提交并公布推理结果，在通过智能合约达成一致意见后，才会执行所请求的操作。",
