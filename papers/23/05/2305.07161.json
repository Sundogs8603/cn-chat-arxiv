    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了基于自编码器的神经网络架构，以压缩组织学图像并保留原始图像更密集、更有意义的表征。当前改进压缩算法的研究集中在允许更低的区域感兴趣（ROI）压缩率的方法上。神经网络能够从图像中提取有意义的语义表征，因此能够选择要在压缩过程中考虑的区域。本文关注全组织切片组织学图像的压缩。我们的目标是构建一组神经网络使有监督的压缩自编码器以更密集、更有意义的方式保留输入组织学图像。我们提出的系统是一种简单而新颖的方法来监督压缩神经网络。我们使用基于迁移学习的分类器测试压缩图像，并展示了测试结果。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a neural network-based approach that compresses and retains the denser and more meaningful representation of histopathological images for whole slide imaging. The system is a novel and simple method for compressive neural networks that allows for supervised learning. Experimental results show that the compressed images produced by the system can still be effectively classified using transfer learning-based classifiers."
