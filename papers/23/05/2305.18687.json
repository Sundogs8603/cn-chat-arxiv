    "translated_abstract": "近年来交通领域中出现了许多时空预测模型的发展。然而，由于交通网络中观察到的复杂而广泛的时空相关性，长程交通预测仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。目前的作品主要依赖于具有图形结构的道路网络，并使用图神经网络（GNN）学习表示，但这种方法在深度架构中存在过度平滑的问题。为了解决这个问题，最近的方法介绍了将GNN与残差连接或神经普通微分方程（ODE）相结合的方法。然而，当前的图形ODE模型在特征提取方面存在两个关键限制：（1）它们倾向于全局时间模式，忽略了对于意外事件很重要的局部模式；（2）它们在其架构设计中缺乏动态语义边缘。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为基于图的多ODE神经网络（GRAM-ODENNs）的新型架构，用于解决当前图形ODE模型的局限性。GRAM-ODENNs使用多个并行ODE编码器和动态图结构，适应交通数据的时间演变，从而实现更准确的长程交通预测。",
