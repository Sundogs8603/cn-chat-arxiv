    "translated_abstract": "随着技术的进步和数字设备的普及，人机无缝通讯的重要性日益增加。移动、可穿戴和其他物联网设备的广泛采用已经改变了我们与这些智能设备的互动方式，使得准确的语音识别成为有效互动的关键组成部分。然而，构建能够处理新关键字的强大的语音识别系统仍然具有挑战性，特别是对于训练数据有限的低资源语言。在本文中，我们提出PLiX，一种跨语种的、即插即用的关键词检测系统，利用少样本学习来利用海量现实世界数据，在测试时实现对未见过的口语单词的识别。我们使用20种语言的数百万个一秒音频剪辑来学习少样本深度模型，在高效率的同时实现了最先进的性能。广泛的评估表明，PLiX能够适应新的口语单词。",
