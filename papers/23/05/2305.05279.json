    "abstract": "Understanding the customers' high level shopping intent, such as their desire to go camping or hold a birthday party, is critically important for an E-commerce platform; it can help boost the quality of shopping experience by enabling provision of more relevant, explainable, and diversified recommendations. However, such high level shopping intent has been overlooked in the industry due to practical challenges. In this work, we introduce Amazon's new system that explicitly identifies and utilizes each customer's high level shopping intents for personalizing recommendations. We develop a novel technique that automatically identifies various high level goals being pursued by the Amazon customers, such as \"go camping\", and \"preparing for a beach party\". Our solution is in a scalable fashion (in 14 languages across 21 countries). Then a deep learning model maps each customer's online behavior, e.g. product search and individual item engagements, into a subset of high level shopping intents",

    "translated_abstract": "理解顾客的高级别购物意图，如他们去露营或举办生日派对的愿望，对于电商平台非常重要；它可以通过提供更相关、可解释和多样化的推荐来提高购物体验的质量。然而，由于实际挑战，这种高级别的购物意图在行业中被忽视。在这项工作中，我们介绍了亚马逊的新系统，明确地识别和利用每个客户的高级别购物意图来个性化推荐。我们开发了一种新技术，自动识别亚马逊客户正在追求的各种高级别目标，如“去露营”和“准备海滩派对”。我们的解决方案进行了扩展（跨越21个国家的14种语言）。然后，一个深度学习模型将每个客户的在线行为，如产品搜索和个体项目参与，映射成一组高级别的购物意图。",
