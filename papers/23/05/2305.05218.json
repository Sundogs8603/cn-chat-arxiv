    "translated_abstract": "准确模拟颗粒流动力学对于评估各种岩土工程风险至关重要，包括山体滑坡和泥石流。颗粒流涉及颗粒动态重组，表现出从固体样本到液体样本的复杂转变。传统的连续体和离散数值方法在模拟大规模系统时计算成本高。基于统计或机器学习的模型提供了一种替代方案，但它们通常是以有限的一组参数为基础的经验性模型。由于传统的机器学习模型需要大量的训练数据才能实现泛化，因此它们的学习会依赖于排列的顺序。为了解决这些问题，我们使用了图神经网络——一种学习局部相互作用的最先进的机器学习架构。图表示了动态变化的颗粒流的状态和相互作用定律，例如颗粒之间的能量和动量交换。我们开发了一种基于图神经网络的颗粒流模拟器，能够准确地捕捉高度动态的大规模系统的复杂行为。我们在一系列基准问题上展示了这种方法的有效性，并表明所提出的模型明显优于传统的机器学习方法。",
