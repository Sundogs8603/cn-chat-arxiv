    "translated_abstract": "文本分类在很多领域中都是一个重要的任务。因此，已经进行了多项研究来开发国际和本地语言的自动文本分类系统。然而，需要为本地语言建立一个自动文本分类系统。本研究的主要目的是建立一个普什图语自动文本分类系统。为了实现这个目标, 我们建立了一个普什图语语料库，这是由于普什图语文本文档的公共数据集不可用。此外，本研究比较了包括多层感知器(MLP)、支持向量机(SVM)、K近邻(KNN)、决策树, 高斯朴素贝叶斯, 多项式朴素贝叶斯, 随机森林和逻辑回归在内的多个模型，以发现最有效的方法。此外，本研究还评估了两种不同的特征提取方法，包括词袋和tf-idf。实验结果表明，在普什图语文本分类中，使用tf-idf特征提取方法的SVM模型取得了最高的97.19%的准确率。",
