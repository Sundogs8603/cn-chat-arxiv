We apply this framework to real-world experiments, in which each participant works alongside another person or an AI agent in a question-answering setting, repeatedly assessing their teammate's performance. Using this experimental data, we demonstrate the use of our framework for testing research questions about people's perceptions of both AI agents and other people. We contrast mental models of AI teammates with those of human teammates as we characterize the dimensionality of these mental models, their development over time, and the influence of the participants' own self-perception.

    "translated_abstract": "深入了解人类如何感知与AI搭档的信息，是我们理解人工智能团队合作的重要基础。我们借鉴认知科学的相关研究，提出了一个基于IRT的框架来模拟人们的感知，针对人与人、人与AI进行实验，并重点研究两者感知之间的异同，以及人们对AI团队伙伴的期望。我们的研究结果表明，人们普遍期望人工智能的表现优于人类，而且对AI成员的心理模型与人类成员的不同。同时，我们还发现学习、反馈和个体差异等因素同样有可能影响人们的心理模型。我们的研究为捕捉和分析人类对不同情境中的AI感知提供了一种有用工具。",
