We first study the behavior of the local approach, and find that the statistics of individual local solutions of Gaussian process sample paths are surprisingly good compared to what we would expect to recover from global methods.

    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯优化中一项最新的发展是使用本地优化策略，与传统的全局策略相比，可以在高维问题上提供强大的实证性能。文献中的“传统智慧”是，专注于本地优化规避了维度诅咒。然而，对于贝叶斯本地优化例程的预期行为或收敛性了解甚少。我们首先研究了本地方法的行为，并发现高斯过程样本路径单个本地解的统计数据与从全局方法恢复的预期值相比非常好。然后，我们展示了最近由Müller等人提出的基于贝叶斯本地优化算法的第一次严格分析，并在有噪音和无噪音的情况下推导出收敛速率。",
