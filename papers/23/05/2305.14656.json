    "translated_abstract": "自然界中，许多复杂系统的行为可以用简洁的数学方程来描述。将这些方程从有限的数据中自动提取出来被视为一个符号回归的过程，这在过去一直是一个巨大的挑战。近年来，人们在解决这个问题上付出了巨大的努力，并取得了符号回归的成功。然而，当前的方法还存在瓶颈，特别是当离散搜索空间趋向于无穷大，并且基础数学公式复杂时。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的强化符号回归机器 (RSRM)，以从有限的数据中揭示出复杂的数学方程为目标。RSRM模型由三个关键模块组成：(1)一个Monte Carlo 树搜索 (MCTS) 代理，它探索由预定义的数学运算符和变量组成的最佳数学表达式树，(2)一个双Q学习块，通过优化搜索空间来帮助减少MCTS的可行搜索空间，和(3)一个强化学习回归器，用于发现最终的数学方程。",
