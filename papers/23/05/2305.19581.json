    "abstract": "Voice activity detection (VAD) improves the performance of speaker verification (SV) by preserving speech segments and attenuating the effects of non-speech. However, this scheme is not ideal: (1) it fails in noisy environments or multi-speaker conversations; (2) it is trained based on inaccurate non-SV sensitive labels. To address this, we propose a speaker verification-based voice activity detection (SVVAD) framework that can adapt the speech features according to which are most informative for SV. To achieve this, we introduce a label-free training method with triplet-like losses that completely avoids the performance degradation of SV due to incorrect labeling. Extensive experiments show that SVVAD significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of equal error rate (EER) under conditions where other speakers are mixed at different ratios. Moreover, the decision boundaries reveal the importance of the different parts of speech, which are largely consistent with human judgments.",

    "translated_abstract": "语音活动检测（VAD）通过保留语音片段和减弱非语音的影响来提高说话人验证（SV）的性能。然而，这个方法并不理想：它在嘈杂的环境或多说话者对话中失败；它是基于不准确的非SV敏感标签进行训练的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于说话人验证的语音活动检测（SVVAD）框架，可以根据SV最具信息量的语音特征进行调整。为了实现这一点，我们引入了一种无标签训练方法，利用类三元组损失函数，完全避免了由于错误标记而导致的SV性能下降。广泛的实验表明，SVVAD在其他说话者混合的条件下，平均等误差率（EER）方面显著优于基线。此外，决策边界揭示了语音不同部分的重要性，这与人类判断基本一致。",
