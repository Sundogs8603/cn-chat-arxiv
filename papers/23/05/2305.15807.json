    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了带有背包问题的上下文信息决策问题（CBwK），每一轮获得一个标量奖励和一个向量值的成本。我们的目标是最大化累计的奖励，并确保累计成本低于某个预定的成本限制。我们假设环境来自一个连续集合，成本可以带符号，并且未知的期望奖励和成本函数可以被一致地估计，这是文献中的一个典型假设。在这种情况下，迄今为止总成本约束至少要为$T^{3/4}$，其中$T$是轮数，并且甚至通常被假定为与$T$线性相关。然而，我们受到鼓舞，使用CBwK来强制实施实现组之间平均成本平等的公平性约束：与相应成本约束相关的预算应尽可能接近于阶数为$\\sqrt{T}$级别的自然偏差。为此，我们介绍了一种基于对偶策略的方法。",
