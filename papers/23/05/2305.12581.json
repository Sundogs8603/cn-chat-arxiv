    "translated_abstract": "后选择推断（PoSI）是一种统计技术，用于在假设生成和测试使用相同的数据来源时获取有效的置信区间和p值。 PoSI可用于一系列流行的算法，包括Lasso。 数据切片是PoSI的变体，在推断时间将部分保留数据与假设生成数据结合使用。虽然数据切片具有有吸引力的理论和实证性质，但现有方法依赖于计算昂贵的MCMC方法来执行推断。本文的关键贡献在于展示可基于已知的参数分布构建数据切片过程的枢轴量。具体而言，在高斯响应的一组多面体约束下，数据切片将遵循正常值和截断正常值之和（SNTN），这是截断双变量正态分布的一个变体。这种洞察力的主要影响是使数据切片的有效和确切的后选择推断成为可能，而无需采用计算密集型的MCMC方法。",
