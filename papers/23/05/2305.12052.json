Several pluvial flooding events were simulated in a low-relief high-resolution urban environment using a 2D HEC-RAS hydrodynamic model. These simulations were assembled into a training set for the DNNs, which were then used to forecast flooding depths and velocities. The DNNs' forecasts were compared to the hydrodynamic flood models, and showed good agreement, with a median RMSE of around 2 mm for cell flooding depths in the study area.
