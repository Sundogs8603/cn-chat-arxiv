    "translated_abstract": "转化率（CVR）预测是在线推荐系统的核心组件之一，已经提出了各种方法以获得准确和一致的CVR估计。然而，我们观察到，即使训练良好的CVR预测模型，在促销期间也经常表现出次优的性能。这主要归因于数据分布转移问题，其中传统方法不再起作用。因此，我们寻求开发替代建模技术用于CVR预测。观察到不同促销之间存在相似的购买模式，我们提出了重用历史促销数据以捕捉促销转化模式的方法。因此，我们提出了一种新颖的历史数据再利用（HDR）方法，该方法首先检索历史上相似的促销数据，然后使用获取的数据微调CVR预测模型以更好地适应促销模式。HDR由三个组件组成：自动数据",
