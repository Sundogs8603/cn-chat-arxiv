    "abstract": "As Autonomous Systems (AS) become more ubiquitous in society, more responsible for our safety and our interaction with them more frequent, it is essential that they are trustworthy. Assessing the trustworthiness of AS is a mandatory challenge for the verification and development community. This will require appropriate standards and suitable metrics that may serve to objectively and comparatively judge trustworthiness of AS across the broad range of current and future applications. The meta-expression `trustworthiness' is examined in the context of AS capturing the relevant qualities that comprise this term in the literature. Recent developments in standards and frameworks that support assurance of autonomous systems are reviewed. A list of key challenges are identified for the community and we present an outline of a process that can be used as a trustworthiness assessment framework for AS.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着自主系统在社会中变得越来越普遍，对于我们的安全和与它们的交互越来越频繁，使它们信得过是必要的。评估自主系统的可信度对于验证和开发社区来说是一项必要的挑战。这将需要适当的标准和适当的度量标准，可以在当前和未来的广泛应用范围内客观地和比较地判断AS的可信度。在文章中，考虑到文献中构成这个词的相关特质，对自主系统（AS）中的“可信度”一词进行了审查。回顾了支持自主系统保证的标准和框架的最新发展。我们列出了社区面临的关键挑战，并提出了一个可以用作自主系统可信度评估框架的过程概述。",
