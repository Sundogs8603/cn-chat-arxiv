    "translated_abstract": "1型糖尿病是一种严重的疾病，使患者无法调节血糖水平，导致各种医疗并发症。人工胰腺系统已经开发出来作为1型糖尿病患者的解决方案，以模拟胰腺的行为和调节血糖水平。然而，目前的人工胰腺系统缺乏对运动引起的血糖摄取的检测能力，这可能会持续4到8个小时。这种无能会导致低血糖，如果不加治疗，可能会造成严重后果，包括死亡。现有的运动检测方法要么局限于单一传感器数据，要么使用不准确的模型进行运动检测，使它们在实践中不太有效。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个集成学习框架，结合了数据驱动的生理模型和Siamese网络，利用多个生理信号流进行高精度的运动检测。",
