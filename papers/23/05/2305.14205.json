    "translated_abstract": "跨语言摘要是指在给定不同语言的输入文档的情况下生成一份摘要，以便将相关内容传播给其他语言的讲者。这项任务的挑战主要在于跨语言数据集的匮乏和摘要和翻译的复合难度。本文提出了一种名为$\\mu$PLAN的跨语言摘要方法，它使用一个中间计划步骤作为跨语言桥梁。我们将计划形式化为一系列实体，捕捉摘要的内容和应该传达的顺序。重要的是，我们的计划抽象了表面形式：使用多语言知识库，我们将实体与它们在不同语言中的规范指定对齐，并在此跨语言桥梁和输入的条件下生成摘要。在XWikis数据集上进行的自动和人工评估（涵盖四种语言对）证明了我们的规划目标达到了最新的水平。",
