    "abstract": "Transfer learning is an essential tool for improving the performance of primary tasks by leveraging information from auxiliary data resources. In this work, we propose Adaptive Robust Transfer Learning (ART), a flexible pipeline of performing transfer learning with generic machine learning algorithms. We establish the non-asymptotic learning theory of ART, providing a provable theoretical guarantee for achieving adaptive transfer while preventing negative transfer. Additionally, we introduce an ART-integrated-aggregating machine that produces a single final model when multiple candidate algorithms are considered. We demonstrate the promising performance of ART through extensive empirical studies on regression, classification, and sparse learning.

    "translated_abstract": "转移学习是利用辅助数据资源来提高主要任务性能的重要工具。在本文中，我们提出自适应稳健转移学习（ART），一种使用通用机器学习算法进行转移学习的灵活管道。我们建立了ART的非渐近学习理论，为实现自适应转移并防止负面转移提供了可证明的理论保证。此外，我们介绍了一种ART集成聚合机制，用于在考虑多个候选算法时产生单个最终模型。通过回归、分类和稀疏学习的广泛实证研究，我们展示了ART的良好性能。我们进一步提出了一个涉及死亡率研究的真实数据分析。",
