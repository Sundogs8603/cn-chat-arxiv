    "translated_abstract": "利用全球定位卫星系统（GNSS）轨迹检测出行方式对了解个人出行行为至关重要，是实现可持续交通系统的先决条件。虽然研究已经认识到将地理空间背景信息纳入出行方式检测模型中的好处，但很少有文章总结了背景建模方法，并分析了这些背景特征的重要性，这妨碍了高效模型的开发。本文确定了与相关工作有关的背景表示法，并提出了一种分析管道，基于随机森林模型和SHapley Additive exPlanation（SHAP）方法评估地理空间背景信息在出行方式检测中的贡献。通过在大规模GNSS跟踪数据集上的实验，我们发现描述与基础设施网络关系的特征，例如到铁路或道路网络的距离，对模型的预测有显着贡献。",
