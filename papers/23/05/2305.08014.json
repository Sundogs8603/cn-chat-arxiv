    "translated_abstract": "利用低分辨率瞬时高清肌电图像进行手势识别可以开辟发展更流畅、更自然的肌肉-计算机界面的新途径。然而，跨场景数据的变异性存在极大的挑战。现有的方法采用非常大且复杂的深度卷积神经网络或基于2SRNN的领域适应方法，来逼近由这些跨场景数据变异性引起的分布偏移。因此，这些方法也需要在预训练和适应阶段中在数百万个训练参数和大规模预训练数据集上进行学习。结果，这使得在实时应用中进行高端资源约束和计算非常昂贵的部署。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种轻量级的全卷积神经网络+迁移学习模型，利用轻量级全卷积神经网络和迁移学习(TL)来增强跨场景手势识别。",
