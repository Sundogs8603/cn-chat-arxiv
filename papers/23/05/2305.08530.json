    "translated_abstract": "本文重新探讨了投资者效用函数和投资组合分配规则之间的关系。我们推导了基于非对称拉普拉斯分布$ALD(\\mu,\\sigma,\\kappa)$收益率的投资组合分配规则，并将它们与基于高斯收益率的均值方差方法进行了比较。我们发现，在$\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}$趋近于零的极限情况下，马科威茨贡献伴随着一个偏度项。当预期回报是一个随机正态变量的时候，我们还获得了投资组合分配规则，考虑到了预测回报的不确定性。最优的最坏情况解决方案在等重量和最小方差投资组合之间平滑逼近，是风险均衡投资组合的一种有吸引力的凸替代方案。我们利用一个带有随机漂移的微观投资组合模型和以对数正态分布的横截面收益率为特征的预期效用函数的解析式来进行演示。",
