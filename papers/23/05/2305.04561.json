    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于transformer的模型在从胸部X光图像生成放射学报告方面取得了显着进展。然而，一个突出的挑战仍然存在：这些模型经常缺乏先前的知识，导致生成错误地提到不存在的先前检查的综合报告。这种差异可以归因于放射科医师和生成模型之间的知识差距。虽然放射科医生拥有患者特定的先前信息，但这些模型仅在特定时间点接收X光图像。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的方法，利用基于规则的标记器从放射学报告中提取比较先验信息。然后，将提取的比较先验无缝地集成到最先进的transformer-based模型中，从而使其能够生成更实际和全面的报告。我们的方法在英语报告数据集上进行评估，如IU X-ray和MIMIC-CXR。结果表明，我们的方法超过了基线模型，并在各种评估指标上实现了最先进的性能。",
