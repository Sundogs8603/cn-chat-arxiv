    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络 (GNN) 是任何机器学习任务中的一个重要工具，因为它们能够学习图结构上的函数，这是一种强大和表达性强的数据表示。社区检测是一种无监督任务，越来越多地使用GNN进行。利用节点特征的多维度与图的连接性对图中的节点进行聚类，对从社交网络到基因组学的真实世界任务有许多应用。不幸的是，目前文献中缺乏公平且严谨评估基于GNN的社区检测的充分基准环境，从而可能阻碍这一新兴领域的进展。我们观察到这种情况下的特定困难是模糊的超参数调整环境与性能和评估数据集的冲突指标。在这项工作中，我们提出和评估了框架，用于在GNN学习环境中进行一致的社区检测算法比较。我们提供了一个基准数据集，并提出了评估指标，反映了检测到的社区的内在质量以及聚类的准确性。",
