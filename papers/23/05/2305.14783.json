    "translated_abstract": "中文拼写纠错旨在检测和纠正中文文本中的错误字符。虽然在这项任务中引入了语音学信息（汉语拼音），但通常会将语音学表示与字符表示合并，这往往会削弱正常文本的表示效果。在这项工作中，我们提出将两种类型的特征解开以允许文本和语音信息之间的直接交互。为了学习有用的语音学表示，我们引入了一个拼音到字符的目标，要求模型仅基于语音信息预测正确的字符，其中施加了一个分离掩码以禁用从语音输入到文本的注意力。为了避免过度拟合语音，我们进一步设计了一个自我蒸馏模块，以确保语义信息在预测中起主导作用。在三个中文拼写纠错基准测试上的大量实验证明了我们的方法在使用语音学信息进行中文拼写纠错方面的优越性。",
