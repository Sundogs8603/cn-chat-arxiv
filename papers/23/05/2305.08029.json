    "translated_abstract": "基于情绪的实时音乐编排旨在将给定的音乐转化为另一个能够实时引起用户特定情感共鸣的音乐，在音乐疗法、游戏配乐和电影配乐等各种场景中具有重要应用价值。然而，由于目标情感的细粒度和可变性，平衡情感实时匹配和柔和情感转换是一项挑战。现有的研究主要集中在实现情感实时匹配，而柔和过渡的问题仍未得到充分研究，影响了音乐的整体情感一致性。本文提出了SongDriver2来解决这个问题。具体地，我们首先识别最后一个时间步的音乐情绪，然后将其与当前时间步的目标输入情绪融合。融合的情感随后作为SongDriver2根据输入旋律数据生成即将到来的音乐的指导。为了调整音乐相似性和情感实时匹配，以实现两种不同情感之间的过渡，我们设计了一种软过渡机制，将插值和平滑滤波器相结合。我们证明，所提出的SongDriver2可以生成具有高度真实性和平滑过渡的情感音乐，这表明其在基于情绪的实时音乐编排应用中具有潜在价值。",
