We present a novel architecture for sarcasm generation with emoji from a non-sarcastic input sentence. We divide the generation task into two sub tasks: one for generating textual sarcasm and another for collecting emojis associated with those sarcastic sentences. Two key elements of sarcasm are incorporated into the textual sarcasm generation task: valence reversal and semantic incongruity with context, where the context may involve shared commonsense or general knowledge between the speaker and their audience. The majority of existing sarcasm generation works have focused on this textual form. However, in the real world, when written texts fall short of effectively capturing the emotional cues of spoken and face-to-face communication, people often opt for emojis to accurately express their emotions.

    "translated_abstract": "讽刺是个体用来表达与含义相反的事情的微妙形式。本文提出了一种使用表情符号从非讽刺性输入句子生成讽刺性句子的新颖架构。我们将生成任务分为两个子任务：一个用于生成文本讽刺，另一个用于收集与这些讽刺句子相关的表情符号。讽刺的两个关键元素被纳入到文本讽刺生成任务中：情感反转和语义不一致性与语境，其中语境可能涉及演讲者和听众之间共享的常识或一般知识。大多数现有的讽刺生成作品都集中在这种文本形式上。然而，在现实世界中，当书面文本无法有效地捕捉口头和面对面交流的情感线索时，人们经常选择表情符号来准确地表达他们的情感。由于表情符号的广泛应用，合理地纳入适当的表情符号很重要。",
