    "translated_abstract": "在这个高度数字化的世界中，假新闻是一个棘手的问题，可能会给社会造成严重的伤害。考虑到假新闻传播的速度，为用户提供辅助工具和服务以进行事实核查（即假新闻检测）变得必要和有益，无论是专业人士，如记者和研究人员，还是普通的新闻读者。专家，特别是研究人员，在告知人们真实和事实方面发挥着至关重要的作用，这使他们成为非专家检测假新闻的良好代理人，通过检查相关的专家意见和评论。因此，在本文中，我们提出aedFaCT，它是一个Web浏览器扩展，可以通过共享关键词自动发现与所关注的新闻相关的专家意见，帮助专业人士和新闻读者执行事实核查。我们的初步评估与三个独立的测试人员（他们没有参与扩展的开发）一起进行，表明aedFaCT可以提供一个事实核查辅助工具，帮助用户快速轻松地找到相关的专家意见。",
