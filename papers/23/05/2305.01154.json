    "translated_abstract": "近年来，分布式机器学习技术联邦学习（FL）由于强调用户数据隐私保护而变得越来越受欢迎。然而，FL的分布式计算可能导致通信受限并且学习过程变得拖延，需要对客户-服务器通信成本进行优化。选择的客户比例和本地训练循环次数是对FL性能有重大影响的两个超参数。由于在各种应用程序中存在不同的训练偏好，因此FL从业者很难手动选择这些超参数。在我们的研究论文中，我们介绍了FedAVO，这是一种新的FL算法，通过利用非洲秃鹫优化器（AVO）选择最佳超参数来增强通信效率。我们的研究表明，采用AVO进行FL超参数调整可以大大减少与FL操作相关的通信成本。",
