Existing backdoor defense methods mainly focus on backdoor attacks with explicit triggers, leaving a universal defense against various backdoor attacks with diverse triggers largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end ensemble-based backdoor defense framework, DPoE (Denoised Product-of-Experts), which is inspired by the shortcut nature of backdoor attacks, to defend various backdoor attacks. DPoE consists of two models: a shallow model that captures the backdoor shortcuts and a main model that is prevented from learning the backdoor shortcuts. To address the label flip caused by backdoor attackers, DPoE incorporates a denoising design.

    "translated_abstract": "语言模型经常面临多样的后门攻击风险，特别是数据污染。因此，研究针对这些攻击的防御解决方案非常重要。现有的后门防御方法主要集中在带有显式触发器的后门攻击上，对抗各种后门攻击与不同触发器的通用防御方法仍然未被充分探索。在本文中，我们提出了一种端到端集成的后门防御框架 DPoE（Denoised Product-of-Experts），灵感来源于后门攻击的快捷方式，以抵御各种后门攻击。DPoE 包含两个模型：一个捕捉后门快捷方式的浅层模型和一个被阻止学习后门快捷方式的主模型。为了处理后门攻击者引起的标签翻转，DPoE 融入了去噪设计。对 SST-2 数据集的实验证明，DPoE 显著提高了对各种类型的防御性能。",
