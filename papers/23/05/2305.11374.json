    "abstract": "Humans teach others about the world through language and demonstration. When might one of these modalities be more effective than the other? In this work, we study the factors that modulate the effectiveness of language vs. demonstration using multi-agent systems to model human communication. Specifically, we train neural network agents to teach via language or demonstration in a grounded communication task, manipulating 1) the inherent difficulty of the task and 2) the competence of the teacher. We find that teaching by demonstration is more effective in the simplest settings, but language is more effective as task difficulty increases, due to its ability to generalize more effectively to unseen scenarios. Overall, these results provide converging evidence for a tradeoff between language and demonstration as teaching modalities in humans, and make the novel predictions that demonstration may be optimal for easy tasks, while language enables generalization in more challenging settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "人类通过语言和演示来向他人教授关于世界的知识。何时其中一种方式比另一种方式更有效？本文使用多智能体系统来模拟人类交流，研究了语言和演示的有效性调节因素。具体而言，我们训练神经网络代理通过语言或演示进行基于场景的通信任务，操纵1）任务的内在难度和2）教师的能力。我们发现，在最简单的设置中，演示教学更有效，但随着任务难度的增加，语言更有效，因为它能够更有效地推广到未见过的情境。总体而言，这些结果提供了语言和演示作为人类教学方式之间权衡的证据，并提出了一种新的预测，即演示可能是简单任务的最佳选择，而语言则能够在更具挑战性的环境中实现推广。",
    "tldr": "研究探讨了通过语言和演示交流的教学模式的比较。结果表明，当任务较为简单时，演示教学更为有效；而当任务难度增加时，语言教学更容易推广到未见过的情境中。研究提供了语言和演示作为人类教学方式的权衡证据，同时对于在不同任务中应该选择何种教学方式提出了新的预测。",

The results indicate that demonstration is more effective for simpler tasks, while language is more effective for more challenging scenarios due to its ability to generalize. The paper provides evidence of a tradeoff between language and demonstration in human teaching and makes novel predictions for the optimal teaching modality in various tasks."
