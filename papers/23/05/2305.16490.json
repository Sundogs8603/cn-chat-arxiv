    "translated_abstract": "深度学习在过去十年中取得了重大进展，并展示了解决具有广泛社会影响问题的潜力。在高风险决策领域，如法律，专家经常需要解释性以便在实际环境中使用自动化系统。在这项工作中，我们试图解决应用于重要问题的法律引文预测(LCP)的这些要求。我们设计任务，并类比律师的思维过程，即参考先例和立法规定。在初步实验结果后，我们通过法律专家的反馈，改进了目标引文预测。此外，我们引入原型架构来增加可解释性，同时遵循律师使用的决策参数，实现强大的性能。本研究建立在并利用了具有法律状况的语言处理模型的最新技术，同时考虑到了高风险任务在实际社会影响中的重要考虑因素。",
