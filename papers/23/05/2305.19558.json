    "translated_abstract": "移动增强现实 (MAR) 将真实场景与虚拟内容融合，被视为 Metaverse 中普遍接口之一。由于 MAR 设备计算能力和电池寿命有限，因此常见的做法是将计算任务卸载到靠近设备的边缘或云服务器上。然而，为 MAR 任务开发的现有卸载方案在提供多用户 MAR 服务时存在高迁移开销、可扩展性差和短视性的问题。为解决这些问题，设计并评估了一种基于 MAR 服务的任务卸载方案，应用于边缘云计算网络中。具体而言，首先使用有向无环图对 MAR 应用的任务相互依赖性进行分析和建模。然后，提出了一种基于改进的蒙特卡罗树 (MMCT) 搜索的前瞻式卸载方案，可以提前运行多个多步执行，以获取即时行动的长期效果估计。实验结果表明，我们提出的方案可以显著减少任务延迟和能量消耗，同时对多用户 MAR 服务保持任务准确性和公平性。",

Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce task latency and energy consumption."
