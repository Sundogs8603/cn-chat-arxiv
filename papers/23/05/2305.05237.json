    "translated_abstract": "随着时间推移会不断建设新的道路，但是之前的深度预测模型对于新道路（未见数据）的泛化能力很少被探索。本文引入了一个被称为时空（ST）分割的新设置，以评估模型对未见数据的泛化能力。在这个设置中，模型训练时使用一部分的道路数据，但测试时使用未见数据的道路。我们还提出了一种新的框架，称之为空间对比预训练（SCPT），其中引入了一个空间编码器模块来提取推理时未见道路的潜在特征。这个空间编码器是使用对比学习预训练的。在推理时，空间编码器仅需要新道路的两天交通数据，而不需要任何重新训练。我们还展示了空间编码器的输出可以有效地用于推断未见道路上的潜在节点嵌入。",
