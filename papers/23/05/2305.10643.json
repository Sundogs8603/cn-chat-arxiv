    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have consistently shown great performance in several real-world use cases like autonomous vehicles, satellite imaging, etc., effectively leveraging large corpora of labeled training data. However, learning unbiased models depends on building a dataset that is representative of a diverse range of realistic scenarios for a given task. This is challenging in many settings where data comes from high-volume streams, with each scenario occurring in random interleaved episodes at varying frequencies. We study realistic streaming settings where data instances arrive in and are sampled from an episodic multi-distributional data stream. Using submodular information measures, we propose STREAMLINE, a novel streaming active learning framework that mitigates scenario-driven slice imbalance in the working labeled data via a three-step procedure of slice identification, slice-aware budgeting, and data selection. We extensively evaluate STREAMLINE on real-world streaming scenarios",

    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在自动驾驶车辆、卫星成像等多个实际用例中表现出色，可以有效利用大量已标记训练数据。然而，学习无偏差模型取决于建立代表给定任务各种现实场景的数据集。在许多环境中，数据来自高流量流，每种情况出现在随机交错的情况下，频率各异。我们研究了实际的流式场景，其中数据实例以及从分布式数据流中取样。利用子模信息量度，我们提出了一种新的流式主动学习框架STREAMLINE，通过切片识别、切片感知预算和数据选择的三步流程，缓解了工作标记数据中场景驱动的切片不平衡问题。我们对STREAMLINE进行了广泛的现实世界流式场景评估。",
