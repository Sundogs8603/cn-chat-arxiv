    "title": "A nation-wide experiment, part II: the introduction of a 49-Euro-per-month travel pass in Germany -- An empirical study on this fare innovation. (arXiv:2305.04248v1 [econ.GN])",
    "abstract": "In a response to the 2022 cost-of-living crisis in Europe, the German government implemented a three-month fuel excise tax cut and a public transport travel pass for 9 Euro per month valid on all local and regional services. Following this period, a public debate immediately emerged on a successor to the so-called \"9-Euro-Ticket\", leading to the political decision of introducing a similar ticket priced at 49 Euro per month in May 2023, the so-called \"Deutschlandticket\". We observe this introduction of the new public transport ticket with a sample of 818 participants using a smartphone-based travel diary with passive tracking and a two-wave survey. The sample comprises 510 remaining participants of our initial \"9-Euro-Ticket study from 2022 and 308 participants recruited in March and early April 2023. In this report we report on the status of the panel before the introduction of the \"Deutschlandticket\".",

    "translated_abstract": "作为应对2022年欧洲生活成本危机的措施，德国政府采取了三个月的燃油消费税减免和每月9欧元的公共交通出行券，在所有本地和区域服务中均有效。在此后的时期，围绕所谓的“9欧元票”继任者的公共辩论立即出现，最终导致政治决策在2023年5月引入售价为49欧元/月的类似车票——所谓的“德国通行证”。本文利用基于智能手机的旅行日记与被动追踪以及两次调查观察了新公共交通通行证的引入，样本包括818名参与者，其中510名为我们在2022年的“9欧元车票”研究的剩余参与者，308名则在2023年3月和4月初招募。本文报告了“德国通行证”推出前样本状态。",
