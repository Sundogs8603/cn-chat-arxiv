    "abstract": "Prior research has investigated the impact of various linguistic features on cross-lingual transfer performance. In this study, we investigate the manner in which this effect can be mapped onto the representation space. While past studies have focused on the impact on cross-lingual alignment in multilingual language models during fine-tuning, this study examines the absolute evolution of the respective language representation spaces produced by MLLMs. We place a specific emphasis on the role of linguistic characteristics and investigate their inter-correlation with the impact on representation spaces and cross-lingual transfer performance. Additionally, this paper provides preliminary evidence of how these findings can be leveraged to enhance transfer to linguistically distant languages.",

    "translated_abstract": "先前的研究已经探讨了不同语言特征对跨语言传递性能的影响。本研究探讨了这种效应如何映射到表示空间中。过去的研究集中在微调期间多语言语言模型的跨语言对齐上的影响，而本研究研究的是由MLLMs生成的相应语言表示空间的绝对演变。我们特别强调语言特征的作用，并调查其与表示空间和跨语言传递性能的影响之间的相互关系。此外，本文提供了初步证据，说明如何利用这些发现增强对语言上相距较远的语言的传递能力。",
