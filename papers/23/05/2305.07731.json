    "translated_abstract": "疫情动态建模和模拟在理解和应对COVID-19等高传染性疾病传播方面发挥着重要作用。本文提出了一种名为“基于注意力的多分辨率图神经网络”(ATMGNN)的新颖深度学习架构，该架构学习将空间图信息(即地理数据)与时间信息(即COVID-19病例数量的时间序列数据)相结合，预测疫情未来动态。关键创新在于，我们的方法可以通过基于数据驱动的学习聚类算法捕获空间图的多尺度结构。这使得我们的架构可以学习捕捉疫情的局部或全局信号，并建模长程的空间和时间依赖关系。重要的是，我们收集和组装了新西兰的新数据集。我们建立了统计方法、时间架构、图神经网络和我们提出的方法的全面基准。在预测新西兰COVID-19疫情趋势方面，实验结果表明，我们提出的ATMGNN显著优于其他方法，在性能方面达到了最先进水平。",

    "en_tdlr": "ATMGNN is a novel deep learning architecture based on spatio-temporal graph neural networks. It can combine spatial and temporal information to predict the future dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. By using a learning to cluster algorithm to capture multiscale structures of spatial graph, it can model both local and global signals and long-range spatial and temporal dependencies. Experimental results show that ATMGNN outperforms other methods significantly and achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting COVID-19 pandemic trend in New Zealand."
