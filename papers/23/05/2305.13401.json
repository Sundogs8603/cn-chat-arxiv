While most works construct linguistic similarity measures based on lexical or typological features, such as word order and verbal inflection, recent work has introduced a novel approach to defining language similarity based on how they represent basic concepts, which is complementary to existing similarity measures. In this work, we study the conceptual similarity in detail and evaluate it extensively on a binary classification task.",
