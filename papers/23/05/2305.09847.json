    "abstract": "This study examines the impact of optimizing the Stable Diffusion (SD) guided inference pipeline. We propose optimizing certain denoising steps by limiting the noise computation to conditional noise and eliminating unconditional noise computation, thereby reducing the complexity of the target iterations by 50%. Additionally, we demonstrate that later iterations of the SD are less sensitive to optimization, making them ideal candidates for applying the suggested optimization. Our experiments show that optimizing the last 20% of the denoising loop iterations results in an 8.2% reduction in inference time with almost no perceivable changes to the human eye. Furthermore, we found that by extending the optimization to 50% of the last iterations, we can reduce inference time by approximately 20.3%, while still generating visually pleasing images.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究考察了优化稳定扩散（SD）引导式推理流程的影响。我们建议通过将噪声计算限制为条件噪声并消除无条件噪声计算来优化某些去噪步骤，从而将目标迭代的复杂性降低50%。此外，我们证明SD的后续迭代对优化的敏感度较低，因此它们是应用建议优化的理想候选。我们的实验表明，优化去噪处理循环的最后20％会导致推理时间减少8.2％，同时对人眼几乎没有可察觉的变化。此外，我们发现将优化扩展到最后50％的迭代可以将推理时间减少约20.3％，同时生成视觉上令人满意的图像。",
