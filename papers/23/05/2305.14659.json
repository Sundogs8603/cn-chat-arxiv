Prior template-based IE approaches assume foreknowledge of the domain templates; however, real-world IE do not have pre-defined schemas and it is a figure-out-as you go phenomena. To quickly bootstrap templates in a real-world setting, we need to induce template slots from documents with zero or minimal supervision. Since the purpose of question answering intersect with the goal of information extraction, we use automatic question generation to induce template slots from the documents and investigate how a tiny amount of a proxy human-supervision on-the-fly (termed as InteractiveIE) can further boost the performance. Extensive experiments on biomedical and legal documents, where obtaining training data is expensive, reveal encouraging trends of performance improvement using InteractiveIE over AI-only baseline.",

    "translated_abstract": "学习基于模板的文档信息提取是一项关键且困难的任务。先前的基于模板的信息提取方法假定具有领域模板的先验知识；然而，实际的信息提取没有预定义的模式，并且是一个即兴创造的现象。为了在实际情况下快速引导模板，我们需要从文档中在零或最小监督的情况下引出模板插槽。由于问答的目的与信息提取的目标交汇，我们使用自动问答生成从文档中引出模板插槽，并研究微小量的代理人类监督（称为InteractiveIE）如何进一步提高性能。在获取训练数据昂贵的生物医学和法律文档上的大量实验揭示了使用InteractiveIE相对于仅使用人工智能的基准测试的鼓舞人心的性能提升趋势。",
