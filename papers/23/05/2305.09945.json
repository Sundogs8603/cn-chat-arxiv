    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于深度学习技术的应用，对强化学习（RL）的兴趣有所增加，但是与象征性系统相比，这些连接主义方法不透明。学习分类器系统 (LCS) 是进化机器学习系统，可被归类为可解释的人工智能 (XAI)，因为它们基于规则的本质。密歇根 LCS 通常在 RL 领域中使用，而匹兹堡系统（例如 SAMUEL）由于复杂的算法设计和高计算要求而很少使用；然而，它们可以产生比密歇根系统更简洁/可解释的解决方案。我们旨在开发两个新的匹兹堡 LCS，以解决 RL 领域的问题：PPL-DL 和 PPL-ST。前者充当“零级”系统，后者重访了 SAMUEL 的核心蒙特卡罗学习机制，用于估计规则强度。我们将我们的两个匹兹堡系统与密歇根系统 XCS 在确定性和随机 FrozenLake 环境中进行比较。结果表明，PPL-ST在两种情况下表现良好。",
