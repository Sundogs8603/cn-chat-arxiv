    "translated_abstract": "神经符号（NeSy）预测模型承诺具有改进的约束遵从性，系统化泛化和可解释性，因为它们允许通过对从子符号输入中提取出的高级概念进行推理来推断与某些先验知识一致的标签。最近显示NeSy预测器受到推理快捷方式的影响：它们可以通过利用具有意外语义的概念达到高精度，从而短于其承诺的优势。但是，缺少对推理快捷方式及其潜在缓解策略的系统描述。本文通过将其表征为学习目标的意外最优解，并确定其发生背后的四个关键条件来填补这一空白。基于此，我们推导出几种自然的缓解策略，并从理论和实证角度分析它们的功效。我们的分析显示，推理快捷方式很难处理，这对于信任它们的合理性产生了疑问。",
