    "abstract": "People are increasingly turning to large language models (LLMs) for complex information tasks like academic research or planning a move to another city. However, while they often require working in a nonlinear manner - e.g., to arrange information spatially to organize and make sense of it, current interfaces for interacting with LLMs are generally linear to support conversational interaction. To address this limitation and explore how we can support LLM-powered exploration and sensemaking, we developed Sensecape, an interactive system designed to support complex information tasks with an LLM by enabling users to (1) manage the complexity of information through multilevel abstraction and (2) seamlessly switch between foraging and sensemaking. Our within-subject user study reveals that Sensecape empowers users to explore more topics and structure their knowledge hierarchically. We contribute implications for LLM-based workflows and interfaces for information tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "如今，人们越来越多地将大语言模型（LLM）应用于复杂的信息任务中，例如学术研究或计划搬到另一个城市。然而，尽管这些任务通常需要非线性工作方式，例如将信息在空间上进行排布以组织并理解它，但目前与LLM交互的界面通常是线性的，以支持对话式交互。为了解决这个限制并探索如何支持LLM-powered的探索和知识建构，我们开发了Sensecape，这是一个交互式系统，旨在通过使用户能够（1）通过多级抽象来管理信息的复杂性，（2）无缝地在规划和知识建构之间切换，以支持LLM进行复杂信息任务。我们的被试用户研究表明，Sensecape使用户能够探索更多的主题并以分层结构组织他们的知识。我们为基于LLM的工作流程和信息任务界面做出了贡献和启示。",
