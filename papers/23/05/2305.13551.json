    "translated_abstract": "实体名称在关系抽取中起着有效的作用，并常常影响模型性能。因此，基准测试中测试集中的实体名称显著影响了关系提取模型的评估。本研究发现，标准的关系抽取基准测试数据集存在大量错误的实体注释，实体名称多样性较低，并且容易出现从实体名称到基本事实关系的捷径。这些问题使得标准基准测试与现实世界场景相距甚远。因此，在本研究中，我们提出了EntRED，这是一个具有较少捷径和更高实体多样性的具有挑战性的关系提取基准测试。为构建EntRED，我们提出了一种基于因果推理（CI）的端到端实体替换管道：ERIC。ERIC对实体进行类型约束替换，以减少从实体偏差到基本事实关系的捷径。ERIC在两个方面应用CI：1）针对需要实体替换的实例，2）确定候选实体。",
