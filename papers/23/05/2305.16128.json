    "abstract": "Evidence plays a crucial role in automated fact-checking. When verifying real-world claims, existing fact-checking systems either assume the evidence sentences are given or use the search snippets returned by the search engine. Such methods ignore the challenges of collecting evidence and may not provide sufficient information to verify real-world claims. Aiming at building a better fact-checking system, we propose to incorporate full text from source documents as evidence and introduce two enriched datasets. The first one is a multilingual dataset, while the second one is monolingual (English). We further develop a latent variable model to jointly extract evidence sentences from documents and perform claim verification. Experiments indicate that including source documents can provide sufficient contextual clues even when gold evidence sentences are not annotated. The proposed system is able to achieve significant improvements upon best-reported models under different settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "证据在自动化事实核查中起着关键作用。在验证现实世界的主张时，现有的事实核查系统要么假设提供了证据句子，要么使用搜索引擎返回的搜索片段。这些方法忽略了收集证据的挑战，并且可能没有提供足够的信息来验证现实世界的主张。为了构建一个更好的事实核查系统，我们提出将源文档的全文作为证据，并引入了两个丰富的数据集。第一个是多语言数据集，而第二个是单语言（英语）数据集。我们进一步开发了一个潜变量模型，从文档中联合提取证据句子并进行主张验证。实验证明，即使没有注释的黄金证据句子，包括源文档在内可以提供足够的上下文线索。在不同的设置下，所提出的系统能够在最佳报告模型的基础上实现显著改进。",
