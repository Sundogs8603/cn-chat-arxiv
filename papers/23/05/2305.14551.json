In this work, we explore image manipulations learned by GANSpace, a state-of-the-art method based on PCA. Through quantitative and qualitative assessments we show: (a) GANSpace produces a wide range of high-quality image manipulations, but they can be highly entangled, limiting potential use cases; (b) Replacing PCA with ICA improves the quality and disentanglement of manipulations; (c) The quality of the generated images can be sensitive to the size of GANs, but regardless of their complexity, fundamental controlling directions can be observed in their latent spaces.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于它们的非线性和高维度，使用GAN进行受控数据生成是令人渴望但具有挑战性的。在这项工作中，我们通过定量和定性评估展示了GANSpace所学习到的图像操作：（a）GANSpace生成了一系列高质量的图像操作，但它们可能高度纠缠，从而限制了其潜在的用途；（b）用ICA替换PCA可以改善操作的质量和解缠；（c）生成图像的质量可能对GAN的大小敏感，但无论它们的复杂性如何，在它们的潜空间中都可以观察到基本的控制方向。",
