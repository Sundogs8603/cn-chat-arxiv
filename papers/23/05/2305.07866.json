    "translated_abstract": "Federated Recommendation是一种新的服务架构，可以在不与服务器共享用户数据的情况下提供推荐。现有方法在每个客户端上部署推荐模型，并通过同步和聚合项目嵌入来协调它们的训练。然而，由于用户通常对某些项目具有多样化的偏好，这些方法会无差别地聚合来自所有客户端的项目嵌入，从而中和了底层用户特定的偏好。这种忽视将使得聚合嵌入变得不太具有区分性，并阻碍个性化推荐。本文提出了一种新颖的基于图引导的Federated Recommendation个性化框架（GPFedRec）。GPFedRec通过利用自适应图结构来捕捉用户偏好的相关性，增强了客户端之间的协作。此外，它将客户端的训练过程制定为统一的联邦优化框架，其中模型可以同时使用共享和个性化的信息。在真实世界的数据集上进行的大量实验表明，GPFedRec在保护用户隐私的同时，在推荐准确性方面显著优于现有的方法。",
