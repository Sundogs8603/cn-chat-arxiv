    "abstract": "We introduce the notion of geopolitical bias -- a tendency to report different geopolitical knowledge depending on the linguistic context. As a case study, we consider territorial disputes between countries. For example, for the widely contested Spratly Islands, would an LM be more likely to say they belong to China if asked in Chinese, vs. to the Philippines if asked in Tagalog? To evaluate if such biases exist, we first collect a dataset of territorial disputes from Wikipedia, then associate each territory with a set of multilingual, multiple-choice questions. This dataset, termed BorderLines, consists of 250 territories with questions in 45 languages. We pose these question sets to language models, and analyze geopolitical bias in their responses through several proposed quantitative metrics. The metrics compare between responses in different question languages as well as to the actual geopolitical situation. The phenomenon of geopolitical bias is a uniquely cross-lingual evaluation",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了地缘政治偏见的概念——即根据语言环境报道不同的地缘政治知识的倾向。我们以领土争端为案例进行了研究。例如，对于被广泛争议的南沙群岛，如果用中文问，LM是否更有可能说它们属于中国，而如果用塔加洛语问，则更有可能说它们属于菲律宾？为了评估是否存在这种偏见，我们首先从维基百科上收集了一组领土争端数据，然后将每个领土与一组多语言、多选题联系起来。这个数据集被称为BorderLines，它包括250个领土和45种语言的问题。我们将这些问题集提交给语言模型，并通过几个提出的定量指标分析它们的响应中地缘政治偏见。这些指标比较不同语言的回答以及实际的地缘政治情况。地缘政治偏见现象是一种独特的跨语言评估。",
