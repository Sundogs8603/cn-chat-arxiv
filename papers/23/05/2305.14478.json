    "abstract": "Transparency and reproducibility are often seen in opposition to privacy and confidentiality. Data that need to be kept confidential are seen as an impediment to reproducibility, and privacy would seem to inhibit transparency. I bring a more nuanced view to the discussion, and show, using examples from over 1,000 reproducibility assessments, that confidential data can very well be used in reproducible and transparent research. The key insight is that access to most confidential data, while tedious, is open to hundreds if not thousands of researchers. In cases where few researchers can consider accessing such data in the future, reproducibility services, such as those provided by some journals, can provide some evidence for effective reproducibility even when the same data may not be available for future research.",

    "translated_abstract": "往往认为透明度和可再现性与隐私和机密性相反。需要保密的数据被认为是可再现性的障碍，而隐私则似乎会抑制透明度。我提出了一个更富有细微差别的观点，并使用超过1,000项可再现性评估的例子，展示了机密数据可以很好地用于可再现和透明的研究。关键见解是，虽然无聊，但许多保密数据是开放给数百甚至数千名研究人员的。在未来少数研究人员可以考虑访问这些数据的情况下，可再现性服务，例如一些期刊提供的服务，可以为有效的可再现性提供证据，即使同样的数据未来可能无法再使用。",
    "tldr": "可再现性与透明度不一定会受到隐私和机密性的阻碍，因为许多保密数据是开放的。",
