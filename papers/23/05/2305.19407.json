    "translated_abstract": "尽管许多努力已经做出来，但性别、种族和少数民族在临床试验中的代表性不足仍然是一个问题，并且削弱了少数民族的治疗效果。本文针对试验选址任务提出FRAMM，这是一个深度强化学习框架，用于公平的试验选址。我们专注于解决影响公平试验选址的两个现实挑战：许多潜在试验场地的数据模式经常不完整，而且试验选址需要同时优化招募和多样性，因为问题必然是二者之间的权衡，唯一可能通过限制招募数量来增加多样性。为了解决缺失数据的挑战，FRAMM具有一个模态编码器和一个掩码交叉关注机制，可处理缺失数据，无需进行数据填充和完整数据进行训练。为了处理优化招募和多样性的需求，FRAMM提出了一种新颖的公平度量和可调节的限制招募机制，以进行权衡。实验结果表明，在真实的临床试验数据集上，FRAMM能够有效实现公平的试验选址，并在不牺牲入选率的情况下提高多样性。",

Experimental results on a real clinical trial dataset show that FRAMM achieves fair trial site selections with improved diversity without sacrificing enrollment rate."
