    "translated_abstract": "命中率是综合工业过程中预测产品质量的关键绩效指标，它表示在质量控制范围内被下游处理过程接受的产品的百分比。然而，优化命中率是一个非凸且具有挑战性的问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个数据驱动的准凸方法，将阶乘隐式马尔可夫模型、多任务弹性网络和准凸优化结合起来。我们的方法将原始的非凸问题转化为一组凸可行问题，实现了最佳命中率。我们通过Monte Carlo模拟和在钢铁生产中进行的实际实验验证了凸优化特性和准凸前沿。结果表明，我们的方法优于传统模型，在两个实际数据集上使命中率提高了至少41.11%和31.01%。此外，准凸前沿为解决方案的恶化提供了参考解释和可视化。",
