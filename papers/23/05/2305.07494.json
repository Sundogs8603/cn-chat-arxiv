    "abstract": "Most networks are not static objects, but instead they change over time. This observation has sparked rigorous research on temporal graphs within the last years. In temporal graphs, we have a fixed set of nodes and the connections between them are only available at certain time steps. This gives rise to a plethora of algorithmic problems on such graphs, most prominently the problem of finding temporal spanners, i.e., the computation of subgraphs that guarantee all pairs reachability via temporal paths. To the best of our knowledge, only centralized approaches for the solution of this problem are known. However, many real-world networks are not shaped by a central designer but instead they emerge and evolve by the interaction of many strategic agents. This observation is the driving force of the recent intensive research on game-theoretic network formation models.  In this work we bring together these two recent research directions: temporal graphs and game-theoretic network formation. ",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数网络不是静态的对象，而是随时间变化的。这个观察结果在最近几年内引发了对时间图的严格研究。在时间图中，我们有一组固定的节点，它们之间的连通性只在某些时间步骤上可用。这引发了大量算法问题，其中最为突出的是寻找时间张量问题，即通过时间路径保证所有对之间的可达性的计算。据我们所知，目前仅知道用于解决这个问题的集中方法。然而，许多现实世界中的网络并不是由中央设计师塑造的，而是通过许多战略代理人的互动而产生和发展的。这个观察结果是最近对博弈论网络形成模型进行密集研究的推动力量。在本工作中，我们将这两个近期的研究方向结合在一起：时间图和博弈论网络形成。",
