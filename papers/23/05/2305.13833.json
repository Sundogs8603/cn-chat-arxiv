    "abstract": "Changing speaker names consistently throughout a dialogue should not affect its meaning and corresponding outputs for text generation from dialogues. However, pre-trained language models, serving as the backbone for dialogue-processing tasks, have shown to be sensitive to nuances. This may result in unfairness in real-world applications. No comprehensive analysis of this problem has been done in the past. In this work, we propose to quantitatively measure a model's sensitivity on speaker names, and comprehensively evaluate a number of known methods for reducing speaker name sensitivity, including a novel approach of our own. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets provide a benchmark for this problem and show the favorable performance of our approach in sensitivity reduction and quality of generation.",

    "translated_abstract": "在对话中始终保持说话者名称的一致性不应该影响到其含义以及对话生成的相应输出。然而，预训练的语言模型作为对话处理任务的主干已经显示出对微妙之处的敏感性。这可能会导致现实世界中的不公平。过去没有对这个问题进行全面的分析。在这项工作中，我们建议定量测量模型对说话者名称的敏感度，并全面评估许多已知的减少说话者名称敏感度的方法，包括我们自己的一种新方法。对多个数据集进行的广泛实验为此问题提供了基准，并展示了我们的方法在敏感度降低和生成质量方面的优异表现。",
