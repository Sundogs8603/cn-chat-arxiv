    "abstract": "This paper begins with the premise that adverbs are neglected in computational linguistics. This view derives from two analyses: a literature review and a novel adverb dataset to probe a state-of-the-art language model, thereby uncovering systematic gaps in accounts for adverb meaning. We suggest that using Frame Semantics for characterizing word meaning, as in FrameNet, provides a promising approach to adverb analysis, given its ability to describe ambiguity, semantic roles, and null instantiation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文的出发点是副词在计算语言学中被忽略了。这个观点来源于两个分析：一是文献综述，二是一个新颖的副词数据集，用于验证最新的语言模型，从而揭示了有关副词含义的系统性空缺。我们建议使用框架语义学来表征单词含义，例如FrameNet，提供了一种有前途的副词分析方法，因其能描述模糊性、语义角色和空值实例化。",
