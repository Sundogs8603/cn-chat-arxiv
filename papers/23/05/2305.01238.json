    "abstract": "In this work, we consider a Federated Edge Learning (FEEL) system where training data are randomly generated over time at a set of distributed edge devices with long-term energy constraints. Due to limited communication resources and latency requirements, only a subset of devices is scheduled for participating in the local training process in every iteration. We formulate a stochastic network optimization problem for designing a dynamic scheduling policy that maximizes the time-average data importance from scheduled user sets subject to energy consumption and latency constraints. Our proposed algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization framework outperforms alternative methods without considering time-varying data importance, especially when the generation of training data shows strong temporal correlation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一个联邦边缘学习（FEEL）系统，其中训练数据在具有长期能源约束的分布式边缘设备集上随机生成，由于通信资源和时延要求的限制，每次迭代只有一个设备子集可以参加本地培训过程。我们制定了一个随机网络优化问题，设计了一种动态调度策略，以最大化被调度用户集的时间平均数据重要性，同时受到能源消耗和时延约束的限制。我们提出的基于Lyapunov优化框架的算法在不考虑时变数据重要性的情况下优于其他方法，特别是当训练数据的生成显示出强时间相关性时。",
