    "abstract": "The mobile cloud gaming industry has been rapidly growing over the last decade. When streaming gaming videos are transmitted to customers' client devices from cloud servers, algorithms that can monitor distorted video quality without having any reference video available are desirable tools. However, creating No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR VQA) models that can accurately predict the quality of streaming gaming videos rendered by computer graphics engines is a challenging problem, since gaming content generally differs statistically from naturalistic videos, often lacks detail, and contains many smooth regions. Until recently, the problem has been further complicated by the lack of adequate subjective quality databases of mobile gaming content. We have created a new gaming-specific NR VQA model called the Gaming Video Quality Evaluator (GAMIVAL), which combines and leverages the advantages of spatial and temporal gaming distorted scene statistics models, a neural noise model, ",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，移动云游戏行业迅速增长。当游戏视频从云服务器传输到客户端设备时，需要一种可以监测失真视频质量而无需参考视频的算法。然而，创建可以准确预测由计算机图形引擎渲染的流式游戏视频质量的无参考视频质量评估（NR VQA）模型是一项具有挑战性的问题，因为游戏内容通常在统计上与自然视频不同，缺乏细节，并包含许多平滑区域。我们创建了一种名为Gaming Video Quality Evaluator（GAMIVAL）的新型游戏专用NR VQA模型，结合和利用空间和时间游戏失真场景统计模型、神经噪声模型和客观质量模型的优点。GAMIVAL已经在一个大型的移动云游戏内容主观质量评估数据库上进行了训练和测试，并在游戏内容的NR VQA模型方面超越了最先进的模型。",
