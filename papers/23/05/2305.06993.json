    "translated_abstract": "Smatch度量是评估图形距离的流行方法，例如评估语义图解析系统的性能。然而，我们观察到该度量存在一些问题，如不透明的预处理选择可能会影响结果，当前的图形对齐解算器没有提供上界。然而，没有上界，公平的评估不能保证。此外，Smatch的自适应扩展任务（例如，细粒度语义相似性）分散，并缺乏统一的框架。为了更好地检查，我们将度量分为三个模块：预处理、对齐和评分。检查每个模块，我们指定它的目标并诊断潜在问题，为此我们讨论并测试缓解策略。对于预处理，我们展示如何完全符合允许结构不同但有效的图形注释指南。为了更安全和增强的对齐，我们展示了使用流形算法的可行性。",
