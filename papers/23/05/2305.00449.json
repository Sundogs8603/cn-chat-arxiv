In this thesis, we conduct comprehensive empirical research on more than fifty datasets that we collected from the openml website. We study the performance prediction of three fundamental machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest, XGBoost, and MultiLayer Perceptron(MLP). In particular, we obtain the following results: 1. Predictability of fine-tuned models using coarse-tuned variants. 2. Predictability of MLP using feature extraction techniques. 3. Predict model performance using implicit feedback.",
