    "abstract": "Voltage control is crucial to large-scale power system reliable operation, as timely reactive power support can help prevent widespread outages. However, there is currently no built in mechanism for power systems to ensure that the voltage control objective to maintain reliable operation will survive or sustain the uncertainty caused under adversary presence. Hence, this work introduces a Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) approach for power system control problems, with focus on sustained voltage control under uncertainty in a cyber-adversarial environment. This work proposes a data-driven BRL-based approach for automatic voltage control by formulating and solving a Partially-Observable Markov Decision Problem (POMDP), where the states are partially observable due to cyber intrusions. The techniques are evaluated on the WSCC and IEEE 14 bus systems. Additionally, BRL techniques assist in automatically finding a threshold for exploration and exploitation in various RL techniques.",

    "translated_abstract": "电压控制对于大规模电力系统的可靠运作至关重要，以及时提供无功补偿有助于防止普遍停电。然而，目前电力系统没有内置机制来确保在对手存在的不确定性下维护可靠的运行电压控制目标的生存或延续。因此，本文介绍了一种基于贝叶斯强化学习（BRL）的电力系统控制问题，重点关注在网络攻击环境下不确定性的持续电压控制。该工作通过构建和解决一个部分可观测的马尔可夫决策问题(POMDP)中的数据驱动的基于BRL的电压自动控制方法，其中由于网络攻击而造成的状态是部分可观测的。技术在WSCC和IEEE 14总线系统上进行了评估。此外，BRL技术可帮助自动找到各种RL技术中的探索和开发的阈值。",
