    "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) research has made great advancements in recent years with major breakthroughs that have established new benchmarks. However, these advances have mainly benefited a certain group of languages commonly referred to as resource-rich such as English and French. Majority of other languages with weaker resources are then left behind which is the case for most African languages including Wolof. In this work, we present a parallel Wolof/French corpus of 123,000 sentences on which we conducted experiments on machine translation models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in different data configurations. We noted performance gains with the models trained on subworded data as well as those trained on the French-English language pair compared to those trained on the French-Wolof pair under the same experimental conditions.",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理(NLP)研究在近年来取得了重大进展，建立了新的基准，但这些进展主要惠及资源丰富的语言，如英语和法语。大多数其他语言仍然缺乏足够的资源，如撒哈拉以南的非洲语言之一的沃洛夫语。本文介绍了一种包含12.3万个句子的沃洛夫语/法语平行语料库，我们在其中进行了基于递归神经网络(RNN)的机器翻译模型的实验，并对不同数据配置进行了比较。我们注意到，在子单词训练的数据和法语-英语语言对上训练的模型上表现出了性能提升，相比在相同实验条件下使用法语-沃洛夫语言对进行训练的模型。",
