Here, we have made significant progress in solving the crystal structure prediction problem with a simple but powerful machine-learning workflow; using a machine-learning surrogate for first-principles energy calculations, we performed non-iterative, single-shot screening using a large library of virtually created crystal structures. The present method relies on two key technical components: transfer learning, which enables a highly accurate energy prediction of pre-relaxed crystalline states given only a small set of training samples from first-principles calculations, and generative models to create promising and diverse crystal structure",

    "translated_abstract": "可以通过找到原子构型能量曲面的全局或局部极小值来预测组装原子的稳定或亚稳定晶体结构。通常，这需要重复的第一原理能量计算，这在包含30个以上原子的大型系统中是不实际的。本研究使用简单但功能强大的机器学习工作流，使用机器学习辅助第一原理能量计算，对大量虚拟创建的晶体结构进行非迭代式单次筛选，从而在解决晶体结构预测问题方面取得了重大进展。",
    "tldr": "本研究使用机器学习方法在多个结构预测标准测试中精确识别含有100个以上原子的许多材料的全局最小结构，并以单次能量评估为基础，取代了重复的第一原理能量计算过程。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper uses machine-learned formation energies to accurately predict the global minimum structure of many materials with more than 100 atoms per unit cell, replacing repeat first-principles energy calculations with a non-iterative, single-shot screening process. The proposed method relies on transfer learning and generative models, and demonstrates effectiveness in several crystal structure prediction benchmarks."
