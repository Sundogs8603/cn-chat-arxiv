We recommend a simple variant of the standard algorithm, in which clusters are merged by maximum average dot product and not, for example, by minimum distance or within-cluster variance. We demonstrate that the tree output by this algorithm provides a bona fide estimate of generative hierarchical structure in data, under a generic probabilistic graphical model. The key technical innovations are to understand how hierarchical information in this model translates into tree geometry which can be recovered from data, and to characterise the benefits of simultaneously growing sample size and data dimension. We demonstrate superior tree recovery performance with real data over existing approaches such as UPGMA, Ward's method, and HDBSCAN.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提供了一个对于已有凝聚聚类算法的新视角，专注于层次结构的恢复。我们建议一种简单的标准算法变体，其中聚类是通过最大平均点积而不是最小距离或簇内方差来合并的。我们证明了此算法输出的树可以作为数据生成层次结构的可靠估计。关键技术创新在于理解模型中的层次信息如何转化为可从数据中恢复的树形几何信息，并同时增长样本大小和数据维数的好处。我们在真实数据上展示了优于现有方法（如UPGMA、Ward's方法和HDBSCAN）的树形恢复性能。",
