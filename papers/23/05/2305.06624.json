    "abstract": "Tropical semiring has proven successful in several research areas, including optimal control, bioinformatics, discrete event systems, or solving a decision problem. In previous studies, a matrix two-factorization algorithm based on the tropical semiring has been applied to investigate bipartite and tripartite networks. Tri-factorization algorithms based on standard linear algebra are used for solving tasks such as data fusion, co-clustering, matrix completion, community detection, and more. However, there is currently no tropical matrix tri-factorization approach, which would allow for the analysis of multipartite networks with a high number of parts. To address this, we propose the triFastSTMF algorithm, which performs tri-factorization over the tropical semiring. We apply it to analyze a four-partition network structure and recover the edge lengths of the network. We show that triFastSTMF performs similarly to Fast-NMTF in terms of approximation and prediction performance when fitted",
