    "translated_abstract": "本文采用机制设计方法，研究了对称信息买家的最优分配问题。此外，一个买家被分配给一个卖家所产生的剩余价值可能会受到由其他分配产生的外部性的不利影响。这个问题还受到几个因素的影响。买家知道自己的估值和外部性成本，但不知道其他买家的相同信息。买家还接收与状态相关的私人信号，因此实施问题表现出了相互依赖的估值。这阻止了对VCG机制的简单应用，为了克服这个相互依赖问题，我们构建了一个两阶段机制。在第一阶段，我们利用公司对状态的信号的相关性来诱导观察信号的真实报告。鉴于买家在阶段1中诚实，我们在阶段2中使用类似于VCG机制的机制，诱导估值和外部性函数的诚实报告。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a two-stage mechanism for optimal assignment problems with asymmetrically informed buyers, where the interdependent valuations and externalities are considered, and buyers only know their own valuations and externality costs, but not those of other buyers. The first stage exploits correlation in the firms signals about the state to induce truthful reporting of observed signals, and in the second stage, a VCG-like mechanism is used to induce honest reporting of valuation and externality functions."
