    "translated_abstract": "仇恨言论是影响许多在线平台的严重问题。迄今为止，已进行了多项研究以开发强大的仇恨言论检测系统。近来，像ChatGPT这样的大型语言模型已经展示了在执行多个任务，包括仇恨言论检测方面的巨大潜力。然而，了解这些模型的局限性以建立强大的仇恨言论检测系统是至关重要的。为了弥合这一差距，我们的研究旨在评估ChatGPT模型在跨11种语言的粒度级别上检测仇恨言论的优势和劣势。我们的评估采用一系列功能测试，揭示了模型的各种复杂故障，而聚合指标如宏F1或准确性则无法展示。此外，我们还调查了包括使用表情符号在内的复杂情感对ChatGPT模型表现的影响。我们的分析突出了生成模型在检测某些类型的仇恨言论方面的缺点，并为未来开发更强大的仇恨言论检测系统提供了见解。",
