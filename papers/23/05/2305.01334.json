    "abstract": "A/B testing is a widely-used paradigm within marketing optimization because it promises identification of causal effects and because it is implemented out of the box in most messaging delivery software platforms. Modern businesses, however, often run many A/B/n tests at the same time and in parallel, and package many content variations into the same messages, not all of which are part of an explicit test. Whether as the result of many teams testing at the same time, or as part of a more sophisticated reinforcement learning (RL) approach that continuously adapts tests and test condition assignment based on previous results, dynamic parallel testing cannot be evaluated the same way traditional A/B tests are evaluated. This paper presents a method for disentangling the causal effects of the various tests under conditions of continuous test adaptation, using a matched-synthetic control group that adapts alongside the tests.",

    "translated_abstract": "A/B测试是市场优化中广泛使用的一种范例，因为它承诺能够识别因果效应，并且它已经在大多数消息传递软件平台中实现。然而，现代企业经常同时并行运行多个A/B/n测试，并将许多内容变化打包到相同的消息中，其中并不是所有内容变化都是明确测试的一部分。无论是由于许多团队同时测试，还是作为更复杂的强化学习（RL）方法的一部分，该方法不断根据以前的结果调整测试和测试条件分配，动态并行测试不能像传统的A/B测试一样评估。本文提出了一种方法，使用随着测试而不断适应的匹配合成控制组，在连续测试适应的条件下区分各种测试的因果效应。",
