    "translated_abstract": "数据稀疏性是点击率预测的一个重要问题，特别是当用户-物品交互太稀疏以至于无法学习可靠的模型时。最近，为了利用相关领域的有意义数据，许多跨领域点击率（CDCTR）预测工作已经被开发出来。然而，大多数现有的CDCTR工作具有不切实际的限制，需要跨领域之间具有完全相同的特征输入，而跨领域与不同的特征输入的CDCTR尚未被广泛探索，但这是一个紧急和重要的研究问题。本文中，我们提出了一个跨领域增强网络（CDAnet），能够在具有异构输入的两个领域之间执行知识转移。具体而言，CDAnet包含一个设计良好的翻译网络和一个增强网络，这两个网络训练过程是依次进行的。翻译网络能够计算出具有异构输入的两个领域的特征，增强网络能够生成增强样本以缓解数据稀疏问题。在两个公共数据集上的大量实验证明了我们提出的方法优于现有的基线方法。",
