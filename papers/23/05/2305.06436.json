We extend existing automatic scenario generation methods to optimize warehouse layouts.

    "translated_abstract": "随着多智能体路径规划(MAPF)技术的快速发展，研究人员开始将MAPF算法应用于大型自动化仓库中，以协调数百个机器人。虽然大多数研究旨在通过开发更好的MAPF算法来提高仓库的吞吐量，但我们专注于通过优化仓库布局来提高其吞吐量。我们发现，即使使用最先进的MAPF算法，通常使用的人工设计布局也可能导致仓库的拥堵并且具有有限的可伸缩性。我们扩展了现有的自动场景生成方法以优化仓库布局。结果显示，我们优化后的仓库布局(1)减少了交通拥堵，从而提高了吞吐量，(2)通过加倍机器人数量在某些情况下提高了自动化仓库的可伸缩性，(3)能够生成具有用户指定多样性指标的布局。源代码位于：\\url{https://github.com/lun}",
