    "abstract": "Cross-modal retrieval has become a prominent research topic in computer vision and natural language processing with advances made in image-text and video-text retrieval technologies. However, cross-modal retrieval between human motion sequences and text has not garnered sufficient attention despite the extensive application value it holds, such as aiding virtual reality applications in better understanding users' actions and language. This task presents several challenges, including joint modeling of the two modalities, demanding the understanding of person-centered information from text, and learning behavior features from 3D human motion sequences.

    "translated_abstract": "跨模态检索已成为计算机视觉和自然语言处理中的重要研究课题，随着图像文本和视频文本检索技术的进步。尽管在虚拟现实等广泛应用中具有重要价值，但人类动作序列与文本之间的跨模态检索尚未引起足够的关注。这个任务存在一些挑战，包括对两种语言的共同建模，要求从文本中理解以人为中心的信息，并从三维人体运动序列中学习行为特征。以往的运动数据建模主要依赖于自回归特征提取器，这可能会遗忘以前的信息，而我们提出了一种创新模型，其中包括简单而强大的基于变换器的运动和文本编码器，可以从两种不同的模态中学习表示并捕捉长期依赖",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一个创新模型，使用MildTriple Loss捕捉长期依赖并模拟跨模态人类动作序列与文本检索任务，具有重要的应用价值。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an innovative model that uses MildTriple Loss to capture long-term dependencies and simulates cross-modal retrieval between human motion sequences and text, which has crucial application value."
