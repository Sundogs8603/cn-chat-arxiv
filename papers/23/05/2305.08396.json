    "translated_abstract": "近年来，卷积神经网络在医学图像分析方面取得了重大进展。然而，卷积算子的局部性质抑制了CNNs捕捉全局和长程交互。最近，Transformer在计算机视觉社区和医学图像分割中变得流行。但是，自我注意机制的可扩展性问题和缺乏CNN类归纳偏差限制了它们的应用。在本文中，我们提出了MaxViT-UNet，一种基于编码器-解码器混合视觉变压器的医学图像分割模型。提出的混合解码器，还基于MaxViT-block，旨在在每个解码阶段最小化计算负担下利用卷积和自我注意机制的力量。每个解码器阶段的多轴自我关注有助于更有效地区分对象和背景区域。混合解码器块最初通过上采样传输低层特征。",
