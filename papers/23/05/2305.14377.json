    "abstract": "Recently, methods for learning diverse skills to generate various behaviors without external rewards have been actively studied as a form of unsupervised reinforcement learning. However, most of the existing methods learn a finite number of discrete skills, and thus the variety of behaviors that can be exhibited with the learned skills is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning potentially an infinite number of different skills, which is named discovery of continuous skills on a sphere (DISCS). In DISCS, skills are learned by maximizing mutual information between skills and states, and each skill corresponds to a continuous value on a sphere. Because the representations of skills in DISCS are continuous, infinitely diverse skills could be learned. We examine existing methods and DISCS in the MuJoCo Ant robot control environments and show that DISCS can learn much more diverse skills than the other methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，研究了许多种无监督强化学习方法，用于学习不同的技能帮助机器人产生多样化的行为，而不需要外部奖励。但是，现有的大多数方法学习的是有限数量的离散技能，因此它们展现出的行为多样性也很有限。本文提出了一种新的方法，名为“在球面上学习连续技能的发现”，可以学习无限种不同的技能。在这种方法中，技能是通过最大化技能和状态之间的互信息来学习的，而每种技能都对应于球面上的一个连续值。由于技能在DISCS中的表示是连续的，所以可以学习无限多种不同的技能。我们将现有的方法和DISCS应用于MuJoCo Ant机器人控制环境中，并展示了DISCS可以比其他方法学习到更多的多样化技能。",
