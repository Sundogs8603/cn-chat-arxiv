Manual segmentation by medical specialists can be time-consuming, which calls out for the involvement of technology to hasten the process with high accuracy. For the purpose of medical image segmentation, we inspected and identified the capable deep learning model, which shows consistent results in the dataset used for brain tumor segmentation.

    "translated_abstract": "无论是良性还是恶性的脑肿瘤，都可能危及生命，需要精细的努力来确定类型、起源和位置，更不用说治愈。医学专家的手动分割可能耗费时间，需要技术介入以提高准确性。为了进行医学图像分割，我们检查并确定了能够在脑肿瘤分割数据集中呈现一致结果的深度学习模型。在这项研究中，我们使用了一个公共MRI成像数据集，其中包含233名患者的3064个TI加权图像，涵盖脑膜瘤、胶质瘤和垂体瘤三种脑肿瘤变体。在对数据集文件进行转换和预处理后，我们采用了一些知名的图像分割深度学习模型进行实现和训练，如U-Net和Attention U-Net等不同的骨干结构，Deep Residual U-Net，ResUnet++和Recurrent Resi等。",
