    "translated_abstract": "将点云转换为网格表征，然后应用卷积神经网络的结构可用于雷达目标检测，但从不规则的点云数据转换为密集的网格结构常常会导致信息的丢失，这是由于点的离散化和聚合造成的。本文提出了一种新的体系结构，即多尺度 KPPillarsBEV，以缓解网格渲染的负面影响。具体而言，我们提出了一种新的网格渲染方法 KPBEV，它利用核点卷积的描述能力来改进网格渲染过程中局部点云上下文的编码。此外，我们还提出了一种通用的多尺度网格渲染公式，以任意网格渲染方法将多尺度特征映射融合到检测网络的卷积骨干中。我们在 nuScenes 数据集上进行了大量实验，并评估了检测汽车、卡车和公交车方法的性能。结果表明，我们提出的多尺度 KPPillarsBEV 结构和 KPBEV 网格渲染方法在性能上优于现有的方法。",
