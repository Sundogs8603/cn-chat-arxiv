    "translated_abstract": "在数字病理任务中，变压器已经取得了最先进的结果，超过了卷积神经网络(CNN)。然而，变压器通常过于复杂且资源密集。在本研究中，我们开发了一种名为DPSeq的新颖高效的数字病理分类器，通过微调一个集成了水平和竖直双向长短期记忆(BiLSTM)网络的序列器架构，来预测癌症生物标记物。使用两个国际数据集：癌症基因组图谱(TCGA)和分子与细胞肿瘤学(MCO)中的结肠癌(CRC)的血红蛋白和嗪啉染色组织学图像，对DPSeq的预测性能进行了一系列实验评估。 DPSeq表现出了在预测CRC中关键生物标记物（MSI状态、高突变、CIMP状态、BRAF突变、TP53突变和染色体不稳定性[CING]）方面的出色性能，优于大多数已发表的最先进分类器在同组患者群内的性能。",
