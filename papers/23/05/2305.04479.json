    "translated_abstract": "因果干预是因果推断中的基本工具。在结构因果模型的情况下，它被公理化为do-演算规则。我们提供了一种简单的公理化方法，用于区分不同类型的干预分布的概率分布族。我们的公理化方法整洁地导致了一种简单和清晰的因果理论，具有几个优点：它不需要使用任何建模假设，例如结构性因果模型所强加的假设；它只依赖于单个变量的干预；它包括大多数具有潜在变量和因果循环的情况；更重要的是，它不假定存在底层真正的因果图--事实上，因果图是我们理论的副产品。我们展示了，在我们的公理化方法下，干预分布对于定义的干预因果图是马尔可夫的，并且观察到的联合概率分布对于获得的因果图是马尔可夫的；这些结果是一致的。",
