    "translated_abstract": "Frechet回归已成为处理非欧几里得响应变量的回归分析的一种有前途的方法。然而，它依赖于理想情况下丰富和无噪声的协变量数据，因此其实际应用受到限制。本文提出了一种新的估计方法，通过利用协变量矩阵中固有的低秩结构来解决这些限制。我们的提出的框架结合了全局Frechet回归和主成分回归的概念，旨在提高回归估计器的效率和准确性。通过纳入低秩结构，我们的方法使得在高维度和误差变量回归设置中更加有效的建模和估计成为可能。我们对提议的估计器的大样本性质进行了理论分析，包括偏差、方差和由于测量误差引起的其他变化的全面率分析。此外，我们的数值实验验证了我们提出方法的性能。",
