    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT是另一个大型语言模型（LLM），由于其性能和有效的对话能力，在研究和工业界中得到了巨大的关注。最近，许多研究已经发表，以展示ChatGPT和其他LLMs的有效性、效率、集成和情感。相反，本研究关注的是大多数被忽视的重要方面，即可持续性、隐私、数字鸿沟和伦理，并建议不仅仅是ChatGPT，而是在对话机器人类别中的每一个后续入口都应该进行SPADE评估。本文详细讨论了关于ChatGPT的问题和关注点与上述特征一致。我们通过一些初步的数据收集和可视化以及假设的事实来支持我们的假设。我们还为每个问题提出了缓解和建议。此外，我们还提供了一些未来方向和开放问题的探讨。",
