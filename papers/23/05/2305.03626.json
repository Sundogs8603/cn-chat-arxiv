    "translated_abstract": "在测试时间内验证机器学习模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性是一个重要的研究问题。不幸的是，先前的研究确定，对于决策树集成，这个问题是 NP-hard ，因此对于特定的输入来说是不可解的。在本文中，我们确定了一类受限决策树集成，称为 large-spread 集成，其允许在多项式时间内运行安全验证算法。然后，我们提出了一种新方法，称为可验证学习，该方法倡导训练这种易于验证的受限模型类。我们通过设计一种新的训练算法，从标记数据中自动学习 large-spread 决策树集成来展示这种方法的益处，从而使其能够在多项式时间内进行安全验证。公开可用数据集上的实验结果证实，使用我们的算法训练的 large-spread 集成可以在几秒钟内使用标准半定编程求解器进行验证，同时对抗当前最先进的攻击具有竞争力的性能。",
