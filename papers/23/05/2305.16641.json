    "abstract": "Social biases and stereotypes are embedded in our culture in part through their presence in our stories, as evidenced by the rich history of humanities and social science literature analyzing such biases in children stories. Because these analyses are often conducted manually and at a small scale, such investigations can benefit from the use of more recent natural language processing methods that examine social bias in models and data corpora. Our work joins this interdisciplinary effort and makes a unique contribution by taking into account the event narrative structures when analyzing the social bias of stories. We propose a computational pipeline that automatically extracts a story's temporal narrative verb-based event chain for each of its characters as well as character attributes such as gender. We also present a verb-based event annotation scheme that can facilitate bias analysis by including categories such as those that align with traditional stereotypes. Through a case study ",

    "translated_abstract": "社会偏见和刻板印象在我们的文化中通过故事存在，这在人文和社会科学文献中得到确认。我们的工作加入了这种跨学科的努力，并在分析故事中的社会偏见时考虑了事件叙述结构。我们提出了一个新颖的计算机分析方法，自动提取故事时间叙事下每个角色的基于动词的事件链和角色属性，如性别。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种计算机分析方法，通过事件叙述结构自动分析童话的社会偏见，为分析提供动词事件注释方案，并以性别为例进行了案例研究。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel computational approach that automatically analyzes the social biases in fairy tales by taking into account the narrative event structures, provides a verb-based event annotation scheme for bias analysis, and conducts a case study using gender as an example."
