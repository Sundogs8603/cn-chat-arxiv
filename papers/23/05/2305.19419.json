    "translated_abstract": "自从SemEval 2020任务11（Martino等，2020a）推出以来，文献中提出了多种方法以基于修辞技巧分类宣传内容去影响读者。然而，这些方法一次只能对某个段落进行分类，忽略了同一上下文其他段落标签的依赖关系。在本文中，我们将宣传技术分类作为一种多实例多标签（MIML）学习问题（Zhou等，2012），并提出了一个简单的基于RoBERTa的模型（Zhuang等，2021）来同时分类文章中的所有段落。此外，我们还注意到，由于注释过程，标注者按照决策树对这些段落进行了分类，从而形成了不同技巧之间的层次关系，而现有的方法却忽略了这些层次关系。我们通过为训练目标中的每个节点添加辅助分类器来并入这些分层标签依赖关系，并优化模型。",
