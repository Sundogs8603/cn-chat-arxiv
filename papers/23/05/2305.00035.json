    "translated_abstract": "Segment Anything Model（SAM）最近引起了研究者们的关注，并启发了他们探索它在零样本泛化能力方面的潜力和限制。作为第一个用于分割任务的可提示基础模型，它在一组具有前所未有数量的图像和注释的大型数据集上进行了训练。这个大规模的数据集及其可提示的性质使得该模型具有强大的零样本泛化能力。虽然SAM在几个数据集上表现出竞争力，但我们仍希望探究它在医学图像上的零样本泛化能力。因为我们知道，医学图像的标注获取通常需要专业从业者付出很大的努力。因此，如果存在一个可以仅基于少数点提示就能给出高质量掩模预测的基础模型，那么这个模型毫无疑问将成为医学图像分析的游戏改变者。为了评估SAM成为医学图像分割基础模型的潜力，我们全面研究了其在两个公开数据集（BraTS和LiTS）上的三种提示模式下的表现。我们的实验表明，SAM的性能与专门设计用于医学图像的最先进方法相似甚至更好。此外，提示模式显著影响模型的表现，我们提供了这些差异的原因的洞察。",
