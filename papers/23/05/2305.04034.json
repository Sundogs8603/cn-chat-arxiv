    "translated_abstract": "在知识图谱上回答复杂查询很重要，但由于数据不完整性，它尤其具有挑战性。查询嵌入方法通过基于学习的模型和使用集合运算符模拟逻辑推理来解决这个问题。以往的工作集中于特定形式的嵌入，但嵌入之间的评分函数却鲜有研究。与现有的基于本地比较或全局传输的评分函数不同，本文使用不平衡最优传输理论来研究本地和全局的权衡。具体而言，我们将集合嵌入到带有Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao度量的有界测度空间上，并使用这样的度量来设计评分函数。这种设计还促进了嵌入空间内的封闭形式集合运算符。此外，我们介绍了一种基于卷积的线性计算算法和一个块对角核以实现权衡。结果表明，WFRE可以在标准数据集上优于现有的查询嵌入方法。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种新的查询嵌入方法，使用Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao度量来加权考虑嵌入之间的本地（局部）与全局（整体）特征，同时提出了一种卷积算法来进行线性时间计算，并使用块对角核来进行权衡。在标准数据集上表现出优异的效果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel query embedding method, which uses the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric to weighedly consider local and global features between embeddings, presents a convolution-based algorithm for linear time computation, and uses a block-diagonal kernel for trade-offs. The proposed method outperforms existing query embedding methods on standard datasets."
