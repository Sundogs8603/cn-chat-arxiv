    "translated_abstract": "有效地表示医学概念和患者对于医疗保健分析应用非常重要。在医疗保健分析任务中，表示医学概念需要将医学领域知识和患者描述数据的先前信息纳入考虑。目前的方法，如特征工程和将医学概念映射到标准化术语中，存在捕获来自患者描述数据的动态模式的局限性。其他基于嵌入的方法在融合重要的医学领域知识方面存在困难，通常需要大量的训练数据，这对于大多数医疗保健系统来说可能不可行。我们提出的框架，MD-Manifold，引入了一种新的医学概念和患者表示方法。它包括一种新的数据增强方法、概念距离度量和患者-患者网络，以纳入关键的医学领域知识和先前的数据信息。然后，它采用流形学习方法生成良好的医学表示。在三个医疗保健数据集上的实验结果表明，MD-Manifold在改进疾病诊断和患者聚类等医疗保健分析任务方面具有有效性。",
