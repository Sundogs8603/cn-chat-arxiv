    "translated_abstract": "人工神经网络（ANNs）越来越被用作研究模型，但它们的普适性和表征不变性仍存在问题。生物神经网络在社交约束下演化形成可传达的表征，展示了泛化能力。本研究提出了一种合作代理之间的通信协议，用于分析个体和共享抽象的形成及其对任务表现的影响。该通信协议旨在通过低维表示编码高维信息，模拟语言特征。使用网格世界迷宫和强化学习，教师ANNs向学生ANN传递压缩消息，以便更好地完成任务。通过这种方式，学生实现了更高的目标发现率，并在不同的任务世界中推广了目标位置。进一步优化信息内容以最大化学生奖励改善了信息编码，表明精确的表征可以在通信协议中得到实现。",
