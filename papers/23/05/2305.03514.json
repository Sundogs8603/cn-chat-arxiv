    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT等大型语言模型(LLMs)能够成功地在许多语言处理任务中进行零-shot操作（无需训练数据）。如果这种能力也适用于对说服力和政治意识形态等社会现象的编码，那么LLMs就可以有效地改变计算社会科学(CSS)。本研究提供了使用LLMs作为CSS工具的路线图。为此，我们提供了一组优秀的提示实践以及一个广泛的评估流程，以测量13种语言模型在24个代表性的CSS基准测试上的零-shot性能。在分类任务上，LLMs无法超越最佳微调模型，但仍然与人类达成了公平的协议水平。在自由形式的编码任务（生成）上，LLMs生成的解释常常超过了工作者的黄金参考的质量。我们得出结论，今天的LLMs可以通过两种方式从根本上增强CSS研究流程：(1)作为零-shot检测工具进行无缝工作。",
