    "translated_abstract": "精确地分割视网膜眼底图像中的血管对于早期筛查、诊断和评估某些眼部疾病至关重要。然而，这些图像中存在明显的光照变化和不均匀对比度，这使得分割变得非常具挑战性。因此，本文采用了一种注意融合机制，该机制结合了Transformer构建的通道注意和空间注意机制，从空间和通道维度提取视网膜眼底图像的信息。为了消除编码器图像中的噪声，引入了一个空间注意机制在跳跃连接中。此外，使用Dropout层随机舍弃一些神经元，以防止神经网络过度拟合并提高其泛化性能。在公共数据集DERIVE、STARE和CHASEDB1上进行了实验。结果显示，与一些最近的视网膜眼底图像分割算法相比，我们的方法产生了令人满意的结果。",
