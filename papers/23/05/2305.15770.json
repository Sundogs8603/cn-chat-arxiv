    "translated_abstract": "时间序列预测是许多学科领域里的一个广泛问题，如气象学、交通监测、投资、能源生产和消费等。许多统计和机器学习策略已经被开发来解决这个问题，但是这些方法要么缺乏可解释性，要么当预测时间范围增加时表现不佳。为此，我们提出了一种基于变换的网络架构设计方案，具有潜力在学习中实现增强的感受野，并在不同尺度上融合特征的好处。在这种情况下，我们引入了四种不同的变换机制作为构建学习模型的基础，包括傅里叶变换（FT）、奇异值分解（SVD）、矩阵乘法和卷积块。因此，我们基于以上构建块开发了四个学习模型，分别为FT-Matrix、FT-SVD、FT-Conv和Conv-SVD。需要注意的是，FT和SVD模型具有提取低维表示以增强学习性能的能力。我们在各种合成和实际长时间序列数据集上进行了经验评估，结果显示相对于几种最先进的解决方案，我们的提出的模型具有更优异的长期预测准确性。",
