    "translated_abstract": "水热碳化（HTC）是一种将生物质转化为多用途水炭的过程，无需事先干燥。水炭的物理化学性质受生物质性质和处理参数的影响，使得通过试错实验优化其特定应用成为一项挑战。为节省时间和成本，可以使用机器学习开发模型，对来自不同生物质来源在不同反应处理参数下产生的水炭进行表征。因此，本研究旨在使用涵盖一系列生物质类型和反应处理参数的数据库开发包含性模型以表征水炭。使用两个模型（决策树回归和支持向量回归）来预测水炭的质量和数量。决策树回归模型在预测精度方面优于支持向量回归模型（R2 > 0.88，RMSE < 6.848和MAE < 4.718）。使用进化算法优化决策树回归模型，可以进一步提高精度，并确定影响水炭质量和产率的关键因素。结果显示，这种基于机器学习的方法可以准确预测在不同处理条件下从各种生物质来源产生的水炭的质量和数量。开发的模型有望对从生物质中可持续生产能源和材料做出贡献。",
