    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个分层的空中计算框架，由高空平台（HAP）和无人机（UAV）组成，用于计算通过上行非正交多址（UL-NOMA）连接的陆地移动用户的完全卸载任务。为了更好地评估计算密集型应用程序中信息的新鲜度，考虑了信息年龄（AoI）的标准。特别地，通过调整UAV和HAP上的资源分配和UAV的轨迹，以最小化具有弹性任务的用户的平均AoI，并受到CSI不确定性和UAV和HAP的多重资源约束的限制。为了解决这个非凸优化问题，提出了两种方法：多智能体深度确定性策略梯度（MADDPG）和联合强化学习（FRL）来设计UAV的轨迹，并获得通道、功率和CPU分配。结果表明，与传统方法相比，所提出的方法可以显著减少AoI。",
