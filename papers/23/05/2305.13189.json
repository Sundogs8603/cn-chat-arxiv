    "translated_abstract": "异常检测旨在检测数据中的意外行为。由于异常检测通常是无监督任务，传统的异常检测器通过采用基于直觉的启发式方法来学习决策边界，这在实践中很难验证。这引入了一些不确定性，特别是在决策边界附近，可能降低用户对检测器预测的信任。抵御这种情况的一种方法是允许检测器拒绝具有高不确定性的示例（学习拒绝）。这需要使用一个能够捕捉到与决策边界的距离的置信度度量，并设置一个拒绝阈值来拒绝低置信度的预测。然而，在没有标签的情况下选择适当的度量和设置拒绝阈值是具有挑战性的任务。在这篇论文中，我们通过在ExCeeD计算的稳定度量上设置一个恒定的拒绝阈值来解决这些挑战。我们的洞察力依赖于对这种度量的理论分析。此外，我们设置了一个基于稳定性度量的拒绝阈值，以此来解决这些挑战。",
