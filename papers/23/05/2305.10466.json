    "translated_abstract": "肺癌是起源于支气管粘膜或腺体的恶性肿瘤。孤立性肺结节（SPNs）是一种常见的肺部病变，当其直径大于8毫米时，恶性可能性显著增加。但是，当直径小于8毫米时仍有患肺癌的风险，本研究的目的是使用计算机断层扫描（CT）和生物标志物信息为8毫米以下SPNs患者创建一个评估肺癌可能性的 nomogram。年龄、前体胃泌素释放肽（ProGRP）、性别、癌胚抗原（CEA）和应力腐蚀开裂（SCC）是独立的关键肿瘤标志物，被输入到 nomogram 中。该 nomogram 展示了很强的预测肺癌风险的准确性，具有内部验证曲线下面积（AUC）为0.869。与 nomogram 相比，机器学习模型包括逻辑回归、随机森林、梯度提升决策树和支持向量机，应用于比较其预测性能，结果表明 nomogram 具有更好的敏感性和特异性。总之，我们开发了一个 nomogram 来预测8毫米以下的 SPNs 患者的肺癌可能性，显示出高准确性，表现比机器学习模型更好。",
