    "translated_abstract": "领域偏移是NLP中的一个重大挑战，因此许多方法采用学习领域不变特征来减轻推理阶段的领域偏移。然而，这种方法无法利用与任务相关的领域特定细微差别。为避免这种缺点，领域反事实生成旨在将源域中的文本转换为给定的目标域。然而，由于数据的有限性，这种基于频率的方法经常会错过一些有效和虚假的领域标记关联。因此，我们采用了一种三步领域混淆方法，其中包括基于频率和注意力规范的遮盖、遮盖领域特定提示信息，以及揭示领域通用上下文。我们的实验实证表明，来自我们遮盖文本的反事实样本在12个领域情感分类设置中有10个实现了改进的领域转移，相对于最先进技术平均提高了2%的准确率。",
