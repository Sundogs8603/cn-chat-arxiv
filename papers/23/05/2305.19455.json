    "translated_abstract": "LCLS2自由电子激光器将产生高达1MHz的x射线脉冲，这将需要新的超高速率（UHR）探测器，以在高达100 kHz的速率下操作，并生成高达1 TB/s的数据吞吐量。机器学习已经展示了消化大型数据集以提取相关洞见的潜力，但是当前的实现显示出实时数据降低目标所需的延迟太高。为此，SLAC致力于创建一个软件框架，将ML的结构翻译为部署在数据链的边缘（靠近仪器）的FPGA上。该框架利用了Xilinx的HLS框架，提供了一个模仿开源Keras接口到TensorFlow库的API。这个SLAC神经网络库（SNL）框架设计了一个流式数据方法，以优化延迟。",
