    "abstract": "Lexical Simplification (LS) is the task of replacing complex for simpler words in a sentence whilst preserving the sentence's original meaning. LS is the lexical component of Text Simplification (TS) with the aim of making texts more accessible to various target populations. A past survey (Paetzold and Specia, 2017) has provided a detailed overview of LS. Since this survey, however, the AI/NLP community has been taken by storm by recent advances in deep learning, particularly with the introduction of large language models (LLM) and prompt learning. The high performance of these models sparked renewed interest in LS. To reflect these recent advances, we present a comprehensive survey of papers published between 2017 and 2023 on LS and its sub-tasks with a special focus on deep learning. We also present benchmark datasets for the future development of LS systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "词汇简化（LS）是一种将复杂的词汇替换为较简单词汇以保持句子原本含义的任务。LS 是文本简化（TS）的词汇组成部分，旨在使文本更适合不同的目标群体。过去的一项调查（Paetzold 和 Specia，2017）详细介绍了 LS，然而，自此调查以来，深度学习领域取得了重大进展，特别是大型语言模型（LLM）和提示性学习的引入。这些模型的高性能引发了人们对 LS 的新兴兴趣。为了反映这些进展，我们提出了一份综合性的调查，涵盖了 2017 年至 2023 年发表的关于 LS 及其子任务的论文，特别着重于深度学习技术。此外，我们还提供了未来开发 LS 系统所需的基准数据集。",
