    "translated_abstract": "库尔德手语(KuSL)是库尔德聋人的自然语言。我们致力于自动翻译口头库尔德语和KuSL之间的文本。手语语言的发展速度很快，并且遵循与口语语言不同的语法规则。因此，在任何翻译中，应考虑这些差异。我们提出了一种基于头像的Kurdish Sorani方言文本自动翻译成Kurdish Sign Language的方法。我们开发了该语言对的第一个平行语料库，用于训练统计机器翻译(SMT)引擎。我们使用双语评估验算(BLEU)测试了输出的可理解性并进行了评估。结果显示53.8%的准确率。与该领域以前的实验相比，结果相当高。我们怀疑原因是两个对的结构的相似性。我们计划在Kurdish-BLARK上以CC BY-NC-SA 4.0许可证公开资源。",
