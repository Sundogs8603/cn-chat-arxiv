    "abstract": "With the increasing number and sophistication of malware attacks, malware detection systems based on machine learning (ML) grow in importance. At the same time, many popular ML models used in malware classification are supervised solutions. These supervised classifiers often do not generalize well to novel malware. Therefore, they need to be re-trained frequently to detect new malware specimens, which can be time-consuming. Our work addresses this problem in a hybrid framework of theoretical Quantum ML, combined with feature selection strategies to reduce the data size and malware classifier training time. The preliminary results show that VQC with XGBoost selected features can get a 78.91% test accuracy on the simulator. The average accuracy for the model trained using the features selected with XGBoost was 74% (+- 11.35%) on the IBM 5 qubits machines.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着恶意软件攻击数量和复杂度的增加，基于机器学习（ML）的恶意软件检测系统变得越来越重要。同时，许多用于恶意软件分类的流行ML模型都是有监督学习。这些有监督分类器通常对新型恶意软件的推广效果不好。因此，需要经常重新训练它们以检测新的恶意软件样本，这可能非常耗时。本文通过理论量子ML与特征选择策略相结合的混合框架来解决这个问题，以降低数据大小和恶意软件分类器培训时间。初步结果表明，使用XGBoost选择的特征的VQC在模拟器上可以获得78.91％的测试准确性。使用XGBoost选择的特征训练的模型在IBM 5 qubits机器上的平均准确性为74％（+-11.35％）。",
