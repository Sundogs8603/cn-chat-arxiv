    "translated_abstract": "目前，基于密度的聚类算法因其能够检测具有任意形状的类群而被广泛应用。然而，它们在衡量全局密度、确定合理的聚类中心或结构、准确地分配样本以及处理具有大密度差异的数据方面表现不佳。为了克服它们的缺点，本文提出了一种基于证据推理的颗粒聚类算法（GFDC）。首先，通过一种稀疏度量指标来测量样本的局部和全局密度。然后在高密度和低密度区域中生成信息颗粒，帮助处理具有显著密度差异的聚类。此外，采用了三种新颖的颗粒融合策略来将颗粒组合成稳定的聚类结构，有助于检测具有任意形状的聚类。最后，通过基于Dempster-Shafer理论开发的分配方法来分配不稳定的样本。使用GFDC后，可以得到合理的聚类结果。",
