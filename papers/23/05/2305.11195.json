With this in view, the present work focuses on reservation management programs for large-scale, networked EV charging stations. We formulate a time-coupled binary optimization problem that maximizes EV users' total welfare gain while accounting for the network's available power capacity and stations' occupancy limits.

    "translated_abstract": "随着交通电气化，电动汽车（EV）的普及可能会显着增加配电网络的压力，导致其性能下降和稳定性受到威胁。为了以经济有效的方式容纳这些新负载，现代电力网络需要协调或“智能”充电策略，能够在一个可伸缩和高效的方式下优化EV充电调度。为此，本文重点研究大规模、网络化EV充电站的预约管理程序。我们制定了一个时耦合的二进制优化问题，最大化EV用户的总福利收益，同时考虑到网络的可用功率容量和站点的入住限制。为了在保持高解决质量的同时大规模解决问题，引入了一个基于深度学习和近似算法技术的数据驱动优化框架。该框架的关键因素是一种新颖的输入输出处理方案。",
