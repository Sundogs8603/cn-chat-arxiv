    "translated_title": "基于相关性的多层多模态学习在多能源异常检测中的应用",
    "translated_abstract": "先进的计量基础设施（AMI）已被广泛用作智能能源消费测量系统。电力是AMI可以收集的代表性能源，大多数现有的检测异常能源消耗的研究都集中在单个能源源上，即电力。最近，其他能源源如水、气和供暖也被积极收集。因此，有必要开发跨多个能源源的异常检测统一方法;然而，研究尚未解决这个问题。这个问题的固有困难在于异常通常没有注释。此外，现有的异常定义工作仅依赖于个体能源源。在本文中，我们首先提出了一种方法，考虑到不同能源源之间的相关性，以定义异常。然后，我们提出了一种新的基于相关性的多层多模态学习（CMDML）方法，用于跨多个能源源的异常检测。具体而言，CMDML集成了多个层次的特征和多模态融合技术，以捕捉不同能源源之间复杂的相关性。在实际数据集上的实验证明，CMDML优于现有的最先进方法。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种基于相关性的多层多模态学习（CMDML）方法，以实现多能源异常检测。CMDML 能够综合不同能源源之间的相关性属性和复杂性，并在实验中得到了表现优于最先进方法的结果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a Correlation-driven Multi-Level Multimodal Learning (CMDML) method for anomaly detection across multiple energy sources, which integrates multiple levels of features and multimodal fusion techniques to capture the complex correlations among different energy sources. The experiments demonstrate that CMDML outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."
