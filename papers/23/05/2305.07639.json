    "abstract": "Popular social media platforms employ neural network based image moderation engines to classify images uploaded on them as having potentially objectionable content. Such moderation engines must answer a large number of queries with heavy computational cost, even though the actual number of images with objectionable content is usually a tiny fraction. Inspired by recent work on Neural Group Testing, we propose an approach which exploits this fact to reduce the overall computational cost of such engines using the technique of Compressed Sensing (CS). We present the quantitative matrix-pooled neural network (QMPNN), which takes as input $n$ images, and a $m \\times n$ binary pooling matrix with $m < n$, whose rows indicate $m$ pools of images i.e. selections of $r$ images out of $n$. The QMPNN efficiently outputs the product of this matrix with the unknown sparse binary vector indicating whether each image is objectionable or not, i.e. it outputs the number of objectionable images in each ",

    "translated_abstract": "流行的社交媒体平台利用基于神经网络的图像审核引擎，对上传的图片进行可能存在问题内容的分类。这样的审核引擎必须回答大量查询并具有重计算成本，尽管具有问题内容的实际图像数量通常只是微不足道的一部分。受神经群组测试的最新工作启发，我们提出了一种利用压缩感知技术来减少此类引擎的整体计算成本的方法。我们提出了定量矩阵池化神经网络（QMPNN），其输入为n个图像和一个m×n的二元汇总矩阵，其中m<n，行表示m个图像池，即从n个图像中选择r个图像的选择。 QMPNN有效地输出该矩阵与表示每个图像是否存在问题的未知稀疏二进制向量的乘积，即输出每个池中存在问题的图像数量。",
