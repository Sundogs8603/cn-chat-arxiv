However given numerous products, it's crucial to select most relevant content to reduce the burden of information overload. We introduced a content ranking service powered by a linear causal bandit algorithm to rank and select content for each shopper under each context. The algorithm mainly leverages aggregated customer behavior features, and ignores single shopper level past activities. We study the problem of inferring shoppers interest from historical activities. We propose a deep learning based bandit algorithm that incorporates historical shopping behavior, customer latent shopping goals, and the correlation between customers and content categories.

    "translated_abstract": "在电子商务网站上（例如亚马逊、eBay等），有丰富的推荐内容，可以帮助购物者更有效地购物。然而，鉴于产品众多，选择最相关的内容以减少信息过载的负担至关重要。我们引入了一种由线性因果赌博算法驱动的内容排名服务，以在每个上下文下为每个购物者排名和选择内容。该算法主要利用聚合的顾客行为特征，忽略单个购物者级别的过去活动。我们研究了从历史活动中推断购物者兴趣的问题。我们提出了一种基于深度学习的赌博算法，该算法整合了历史购物行为、顾客潜在购物目标以及顾客和内容分类之间的相关性。该模型产生了更个性化的内容排名，测量值为12.08%的nDCG提升。在在线A/B测试环境中，该模型提高了0.02%的商业度量年化影响，验证了其有效性。",
