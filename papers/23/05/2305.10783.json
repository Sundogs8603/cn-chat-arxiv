    "abstract": "Human intelligence's adaptability is remarkable, allowing us to adjust to new tasks and multi-modal environments swiftly. This skill is evident from a young age as we acquire new abilities and solve problems by imitating others or following natural language instructions. The research community is actively pursuing the development of interactive \"embodied agents\" that can engage in natural conversations with humans and assist them with real-world tasks. These agents must possess the ability to promptly request feedback in case communication breaks down or instructions are unclear. Additionally, they must demonstrate proficiency in learning new vocabulary specific to a given domain.  In this paper, we made the following contributions: (1) a crowd-sourcing tool for collecting grounded language instructions; (2) the largest dataset of grounded language instructions; and (3) several state-of-the-art baselines. These contributions are suitable as a foundation for further research.",

    "translated_abstract": "人类智慧的适应性十分出色，使我们能够迅速适应新任务和多模态环境。从年轻时期开始，我们通过模仿他人或遵循自然语言指令来获取新能力并解决问题。研究界正在积极开展交互式“具身代理”开发，这些代理可以与人类进行自然对话并协助他们完成实际任务。这些代理必须具备及时请求反馈的能力，以防通信中断或指令不清。此外，它们必须展现出学习某一特定领域能力的熟练程度。在本文中，我们做出了以下贡献：(1)一种众包工具，用于收集基于语境的语言指令; (2)最大的基于语境的语言指令数据集; (3)几个最先进的基线。这些贡献适用于进一步的研究。",
