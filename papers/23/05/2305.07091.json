    "translated_abstract": "本文将Borkar-Meyn稳定性定理（BMT）推广到具有任意矩界的信息延迟的分布式随机逼近（SA）中。为了模拟延迟，我们引入了信息年龄过程（AoIP）：具有单位增长属性的非负整数上的随机过程。我们证明AoIP不能无限地超过任何时段所占比例。结合适当选择的步长，这个性质足以保证分布式SA的稳定性。与BMT相比，我们的分析需要关键修正和新的论证方式来处理由AoI导致的SA误差。在分析中，我们展示这些SA误差满足递归不等式。为了评估这个递归，我们提出了一种新的Grönwall-type不等式，用于时变下限求和。作为我们分布式BMT的应用，我们讨论了分布式基于梯度的优化和分析SA的新方法。",
