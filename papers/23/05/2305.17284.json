    "translated_abstract": "图卷积网络（GCN）是直接建模半监督分类图数据类后验概率$p（y|\\mathbf{x}）$的判别模型。虽然作为一种表示学习方法非常有效，但是从GCN中提取的节点表征常缺少有效聚类所需的有用信息，因为它们的目标不同。本研究设计了归一化流，用于替换GCN层，构建一种生成模型，同时建模类别条件概率$p(\\mathbf{x}|y)$和类别先验$p(y)$。由此产生的神经网络GC-Flow保留了图卷积操作，同时配备了高斯混合表示空间。这有两个好处：它不仅保持了GCN的预测能力，还由于表示空间的结构而产生了良好分离的聚类。我们在各种基准数据集上展示了这些优势。此外，我们还展示了额外的参数化正则化优势和通用性。",
