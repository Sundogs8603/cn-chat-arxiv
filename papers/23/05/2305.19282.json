    "abstract": "Persian Medicine (PM) uses wrist temperature/humidity and pulse to determine a person's health status and temperament. However, the diagnosis may depend on the physician's interpretation, hindering the combination of PM with modern medical methods. This study proposes a system for measuring pulse signals and temperament detection based on PM. The system uses recorded thermal distribution, a temperament questionnaire, and a customized pulse measurement device. The collected data can be sent to a physician via a telecare system for interpretation and prescription of medications. The system was clinically implemented for patient care, assessed the temperaments of 34 participants, and recorded thermal images of the wrist, back of the hand, and entire face. The study suggests that a customized device for measuring pulse waves and other criteria based on PM can be incorporated into a telemedicine system, reducing the dependency on PM specialists for diagnosis.",

    "translated_abstract": "波斯医学（PM）利用手腕温度/湿度和脉搏来确定人体健康状况和体质。然而，诊断可能取决于医师的解释，从而阻碍PM与现代医学方法的结合。本研究提出了一种基于PM的脉搏信号测量和体质检测系统。该系统使用记录的热分布、体质问卷和定制的脉搏测量设备。收集的数据可以通过远程护理系统发送给医生进行解释和处方药物。该系统已在患者护理中进行了临床实施，评估了34名参与者的体质，并记录了手腕、手背和整个面部的热像。研究表明可以将基于PM的脉搏波和其他标准的定制设备纳入远程医疗系统，减少对PM专家的诊断依赖。",
