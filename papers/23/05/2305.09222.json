    "abstract": "This study presents a novel approach for touch sensing using semi-elastic textile surfaces that does not require the placement of additional sensors in the sensing area, instead relying on sensors located on the border of the textile. The proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments involving an elastic Jersey fabric and a variety of machine-learning models. The performance of one particular border-based sensor design is evaluated in depth. By using visual markers, the best-performing visual sensor arrangement predicts a single touch point with a mean squared error of 1.36 mm on an area of 125mm by 125mm. We built a textile only prototype that is able to classify touch at three indent levels (0, 15, and 20 mm) with an accuracy of 82.85%. Our results suggest that this approach has potential applications in wearable technology and smart textiles, making it a promising avenue for further exploration in these fields.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种新的接触感测方法，使用半弹性纺织品表面上边缘的传感器，而不需要在接触区域放置额外的传感器。通过在弹性运动织物上进行多种机器学习模型的实验，验证了所提出的方法。其中一种基于边缘的传感器设计的性能进行了深入评估。通过使用视觉标记，最佳表现的视觉传感器预测125mm×125mm区域上一个点的平均均方误差为1.36mm。我们制作了一种仅用纺织品实现的原型，能够以82.85%的准确度分类识别三个压力水平（0、15和20mm）。我们的结果表明，这种方法在可穿戴技术和智能纺织品中具有潜在的应用，以进一步探索这些领域，这将是一个充满前途的方向。",
