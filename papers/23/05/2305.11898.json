    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度卷积神经网络（DCNNs）已经超越了传统算法在图像恢复任务上的表现。然而，这些方法大多数并不适合计算效率，因此执行起来过于昂贵，无法在嵌入式和移动设备上执行。在本文中，我们研究了脉冲神经网络（SNNs）在高斯去噪方面的应用，以达到与传统DCNN相当的性能，同时降低计算负载。我们提出了Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF)神经元进行信息转换处理的形式分析，并将其性能与传统的速率编码机制进行了比较。然后，通过实验评估了神经编码方案在最先进的深度卷积神经网络的去噪性能和计算效率。我们的结果表明，具有LIF神经元的SNNs可以提供具有竞争力的去噪性能，同时降低计算成本。",
