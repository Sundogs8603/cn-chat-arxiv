Such works have involved, for example, performing transfer learning on models trained on one game's content to adapt to another game's content, as well as recombining different generative distributions to blend the content of two or more games. Such approaches arose in part due to limitations in PCG via Machine Learning (PCGML) such as producing generative models for games lacking training data and generating content for entirely new games.

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了基于知识转换的流程内容生成(PCG-KT)的概念，这是一种新的PCG方法和框架，其中内容生成通过知识转换来实现，即将从一个领域获得的知识转变为另一个领域可以应用的知识。我们的工作是由最近许多PCG研究的需求和挑战驱动而来，这些研究侧重于通过改变派生的知识来生成新的内容。例如，针对某个游戏的模型进行迁移学习以适应另一个游戏的内容，或者重新组合不同的生成分布以融合两个或更多游戏的内容。这些方法在某种程度上产生是由于PCG通过机器学习(PCGML)的局限性，例如为缺乏训练数据的游戏生成生成模型和为全新的游戏生成内容。在本文中，我们将这些方法归类为PCG-KT的新视角。",
