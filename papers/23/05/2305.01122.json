    "translated_abstract": "在许多科学和工程问题中，模拟物理系统的时间演化至关重要。模拟这些系统的一个难题是它们的多分辨率动态特性：系统的一小部分非常动态，需要非常细粒度的分辨率，而大多数系统变化缓慢，可以用较粗的空间尺度来建模。典型的基于学习的替代模型使用统一的空间尺度，需要解析到最细的尺度，并且可能浪费大量计算资源来达到所需的精度。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种名为学习可控自适应多分辨率物理模拟（LAMP）的模型，它是第一个完全基于深度学习的替代模型，同时学习演化模型并优化适当的空间分辨率，将更多的计算资源分配给高度动态区域。LAMP由用于学习正向演化的图神经网络（GNN）和基于GNN的演员-评论家用于学习空间分辨率控制策略两部分组成。我们在三个不同的物理系统上展示了LAMP的有效性，它优于统一分辨率替代模型同时减少计算成本。",
