    "abstract": "A seller is pricing identical copies of a good to a stream of unit-demand buyers. Each buyer has a value on the good as his private information. The seller only knows the empirical value distribution of the buyer population and chooses the revenue-optimal price. We consider a widely studied third-degree price discrimination model where an information intermediary with perfect knowledge of the arriving buyer's value sends a signal to the seller, hence changing the seller's posterior and inducing the seller to set a personalized posted price. Prior work of Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris (American Economic Review, 2015) has shown the existence of a signaling scheme that preserves seller revenue, while always selling the item, hence maximizing consumer surplus. In a departure from prior work, we ask whether the consumer surplus generated is fairly distributed among buyers with different values. To this end, we aim to maximize welfare functions that reward more balanced surplus allocations. ",

    "translated_abstract": "一位卖家正在向一系列独立需求的买家定价相同的商品。每个买家都有对商品的价值作为私有信息。卖家只知道买家人口的经验价值分布，并选择收益最优价格。我们考虑了一种广泛研究的第三程度价格歧视模型，其中一个信息中介具有完全了解到到达的买家价值的信息并向卖家发送信号，从而改变了卖家的后验概率，并诱导卖家设置个性化的标价。Bergemann、Brooks和Morris的先前工作（美国经济评论，2015）已经证明了存在一个保持卖家收益的信号方案，同时始终出售物品，从而最大化消费者剩余。与以前的工作不同，我们问的是所生成的消费者剩余是否公平地分配给拥有不同价值的买家。为此，我们旨在最大化奖励更平衡的剩余分配的福利函数。",
