    "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning for molecules exhibit great potential for facilitating drug discovery from in silico predictions. Most models for molecule generation rely on the decomposition of molecules into frequently occurring substructures (motifs), from which they generate novel compounds. While motif representations greatly aid in learning molecular distributions, such methods struggle to represent substructures beyond their known motif set. To alleviate this issue and increase flexibility across datasets, we propose MAGNet, a graph-based model that generates abstract shapes before allocating atom and bond types. To this end, we introduce a novel factorisation of the molecules' data distribution that accounts for the molecules' global context and facilitates learning adequate assignments of atoms and bonds onto shapes. While the abstraction to shapes introduces greater complexity for distribution learning, we show the competitive performance of MAGNet on standard benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在分子领域中的应用极有潜力，可为药物发现提供便利。现有的分子生成模型主要将分子分解为常见的子结构（motifs），之后生成新的化合物。尽管motif的表示法极大地帮助学习分子分布，但是这种方法无法代表超出已知motif集之外的分子结构。我们提出MAGNet，一种基于图的模型，可在分配原子和键类型之前，生成抽象的形状，以减轻这个问题并增加对数据集的灵活性。为此，我们提出了一种新的分子数据分布的因子分解方法，考虑了分子的全局上下文，并促进了原子和键的适当分配。虽然将抽象形状引入分布学习增加了复杂性，但我们证明MAGNet在标准基准测试中具有竞争力的表现。",
