    "abstract": "XLSR-53 a multilingual model of speech, builds a vector representation from audio, which allows for a range of computational treatments. The experiments reported here use this neural representation to estimate the degree of closeness between audio files, ultimately aiming to extract relevant linguistic properties. We use max-pooling to aggregate the neural representations from a \"snippet-lect\" (the speech in a 5-second audio snippet) to a \"doculect\" (the speech in a given resource), then to dialects and languages. We use data from corpora of 11 dialects belonging to 5 less-studied languages. Similarity measurements between the 11 corpora bring out greatest closeness between those that are known to be dialects of the same language. The findings suggest that (i) dialect/language can emerge among the various parameters characterizing audio files and (ii) estimates of overall phonetic/phonological closeness can be obtained for a little-resourced or fully unknown language.

    "translated_abstract": "XSLR-53是一种多语言语音模型，可以从音频中建立一个向量表示，允许进行各种计算处理。本文使用这种神经表示来估计音频文件之间的接近程度，最终旨在提取相关的语言属性。我们使用最大汇集法从“音频片段方言”(一个5秒音频片段中的语音)聚合神经表示到“语料库”(给定资源中的语音)，然后到方言和语言。我们使用来自5种较少研究的语言中11种方言的语料库数据。对这11个语料库之间的相似度测量揭示了已知是同一语言方言之间最大的接近度。这些发现表明: (i) 方言/语言可以在表征音频文件的各个参数之间出现， (ii) 可以为一种很少资源或完全未知的语言获得总体语音/语音学接近度估计。这些发现有助于利用语音的神经表示在语言背景中定位音频信号。",
