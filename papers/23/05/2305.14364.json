    "abstract": "Music therapy has emerged recently as a successful intervention that improves patient's outcome in a large range of neurological and mood disorders without adverse effects. Brain networks are entrained to music in ways that can be explained both via top-down and bottom-up processes. In particular, the direct interaction of auditory with the motor and the reward system via a predictive framework explains the efficacy of music-based interventions in motor rehabilitation. In this manuscript, we provide a brief overview of current theories of music perception and processing. Subsequently, we summarise evidence of music-based interventions primarily in motor, emotional and cardiovascular regulation.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，音乐疗法作为一种成功的干预手段而出现，可以在大范围的神经和情绪障碍中提高患者的治疗效果，而且没有负面影响。脑网络通过自上而下和自下而上的方式被音乐所牵引。特别是，通过预测框架，听觉系统与运动系统和奖励系统的直接相互作用解释了音乐疗法在运动康复中的功效。在本文中，我们提供了当前音乐知觉和处理理论的简要概述。随后，我们总结音乐相关干预的证据，主要集中在运动、情绪和心血管调节方面。我们着重强调提高生命质量和在临床环境之外以及健康个体中减轻压力的机会。这个相对未被探索的领域需要了解如何通过反馈机制个性化和自动化音乐选择过程来适应个体的需求和任务。",
