    "translated_abstract": "提高词汇使用是写作辅助中一项重要功能，本论文介绍了“智能词汇建议”（SWS）任务和基准测试。与其他工作不同，SWS强调端到端的评估并提出更加现实的写作辅助场景。该任务涉及识别需要改进的单词或短语，并提供替换建议。该基准测试包括被人工标记的测试数据，一个用于训练的大型遥感数据集，以及评估框架。测试数据包括1000个由英语学习者写成的句子，附带10个母语为英语的人注释的超过16000个替换建议。训练数据集包括超过370万个句子和通过规则生成的1270万个建议。我们对七个基线模型进行的实验表明，SWS是一个具有挑战性的任务。根据实验分析，我们提出了未来研究SWS的潜在方向。",
