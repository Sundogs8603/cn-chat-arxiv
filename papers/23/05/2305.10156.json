    "abstract": "Comprehending characters' personalities is a crucial aspect of story reading. As readers engage with a story, their understanding of a character evolves based on new events and information; and multiple fine-grained aspects of personalities can be perceived. This leads to a natural problem of situated and fine-grained personality understanding. The problem has not been studied in the NLP field, primarily due to the lack of appropriate datasets mimicking the process of book reading. We present the first labeled dataset PersoNet for this problem. Our novel annotation strategy involves annotating user notes from online reading apps as a proxy for the original books. Experiments and human studies indicate that our dataset construction is both efficient and accurate; and our task heavily relies on long-term context to achieve accurate predictions for both machines and humans. The dataset is available at https://github.com/Gorov/personet_acl23.",

    "translated_abstract": "理解小说人物个性是阅读故事的关键。随着读者与故事的互动，他们对一个人物的理解会根据新的事件和信息而演变；并且可以感知到多个精细的个性方面。这导致了一个自然的问题：情境和精细的个性理解。这个问题在NLP领域中没有得到研究，主要是由于缺乏模仿阅读过程的适当数据集。我们提供了第一个标记数据集PersoNet来解决这个问题。我们的新型注释策略涉及用在线阅读应用程序的用户笔记作为原始书籍的代理进行注释。实验和人体研究表明，我们的数据集构建既有效又准确；我们的任务在很大程度上依赖于长期的上下文以实现对机器和人类的准确预测。数据集可在https://github.com/Gorov/personet_acl23获得。",
