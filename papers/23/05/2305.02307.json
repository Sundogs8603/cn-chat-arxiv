    "abstract": "Existing fashion datasets do not consider the multi-facts that cause a consumer to like or dislike a fashion image. Even two consumers like a same fashion image, they could like this image for total different reasons. In this paper, we study the reason why a consumer like a certain fashion image. Towards this goal, we introduce an interpretability dataset, Fashionpedia-taste, consist of rich annotation to explain why a subject like or dislike a fashion image from the following 3 perspectives: 1) localized attributes; 2) human attention; 3) caption. Furthermore, subjects are asked to provide their personal attributes and preference on fashion, such as personality and preferred fashion brands. Our dataset makes it possible for researchers to build computational models to fully understand and interpret human fashion taste from different humanistic perspectives and modalities.",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的时尚数据集并没有考虑导致消费者喜欢或不喜欢时尚图像的多种因素。即使有两个消费者喜欢相同的时尚图像，他们也可能因为完全不同的原因喜欢这个图像。本文研究了消费者为何喜欢某个时尚图像的原因。为达到这个目标，我们引入了一个可解释性数据集 Fashionpedia-taste，其中包含丰富的注释，以解释受试者从以下三个方面为什么会喜欢或不喜欢一张时尚图像：1）局部属性；2）人类注意力；3）说明。此外，受试者被要求提供他们的个人属性和时尚偏好，例如个性和喜欢的时尚品牌。我们的数据集使研究人员能够建立计算模型，从不同的人文视角和模态全面理解和解释人类的时尚品味。",
