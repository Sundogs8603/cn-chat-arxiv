    "abstract": "The issue of Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) has been one of the most challenging issues in recent years. Weather conditions, camera angle of view, lighting conditions, different characters written on license plates, and many other factors are among the challenges for the issue of ALPR.

In the proposed method presented in this paper, the license plate recognition is done in two steps. The first step is to detect the rectangles of the license plates from the input image. In the second step, these license plates are cropped from the image and their characters are recognized. For the first step, 3065 images including license plates and for the second step, 3364 images including characters of license plates have been prepared and considered as the desired datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动车牌识别（ALPR）是最近几年最具挑战性的问题之一。天气条件、视角、光线状况、不同的车牌字符等等因素都是ALPR的挑战。鉴于近年来深度神经网络领域取得的进展，可以使用一些类型的神经网络和基于它们的模型来执行伊朗车牌识别的任务。本文提出的方法是将车牌识别分为两步。第一步是从输入图像中检测出车牌的矩形。在第二步中，这些车牌从图像中裁剪出来进行字符识别。为第一步准备了3065张车牌照片数据集，第二步准备了3364张包括车牌字符的图像数据集。",
