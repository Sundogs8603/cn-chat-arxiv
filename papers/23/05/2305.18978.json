    "translated_abstract": "帮助人类进行科学设计是人工智能（AI）和机器学习（ML）最令人兴奋的领域之一，因为它们具有发现新药物、设计新材料和化合物等潜力。然而，科学设计通常需要熟悉领域知识的专业技能，这些对于AI研究人员来说并不熟悉。此外，科学研究需要专业的实验和评估技能。这些障碍阻碍了AI研究人员开发专门用于科学设计的方法。为迈向易于理解和可重复研究的科学设计，我们提出了一个用于纳米光子学器件反向设计的基准测试，可在计算上和准确地验证。具体而言，我们实现了三种不同的纳米光子学设计问题，分别是辐射冷却器，适用于热光伏选择性发射体以及结构色滤光器，它们在设计参数空间、复杂度和物理性质上都不同。此外，我们开发了IDToolkit，一个开源的Python工具箱，以为用户提供与基准方法比较其算法的简单接口。IDToolkit包含了反向设计所需的几个模块，例如模拟模块和优化器模块，以及后处理结果的函数。我们希望所提出的基准测试和工具包将加速纳米光子学科学设计新方法的发展。",
