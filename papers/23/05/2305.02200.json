    "translated_abstract": "影响力最大化（IM）被定义为从社交网络中选择一组初始用户以最大化受影响用户的预期数量。研究人员在设计各种传统方法方面取得了巨大进展，其理论设计和性能提升接近于极限。在过去的几年中，基于学习的IM方法已经出现，相较于传统方法，它们具有更强的对未知图形的泛化能力。然而，基于学习的IM方法的发展仍然受到基本障碍的限制，包括：1）有效解决目标函数的困难性；2）表征多样化的基础扩散模式的困难性；以及3）在各种节点中心性约束的IM变体下适应解决方案的困难性。为了应对上述挑战，我们设计了一个新框架DeepIM来生成地表征种子集的潜在表示，并提出学习多样化信息的方法。",
