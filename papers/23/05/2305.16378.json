    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了 Sim-Suction，一种针对移动操作平台的、适用于具有动态摄像机视角的、用于在杂乱环境中拾取未知物体的鲁棒性物体感知吸盘抓取策略。通常采用数据驱动方法实现吸盘抓取策略，需要大规模、精确注释的吸盘抓取数据集。然而，在杂乱环境中生成吸盘抓取数据集仍然缺乏研究，存在着关于感兴趣的物体与其周围环境之间关系的不确定性。因此，本文提出了一个基准合成数据集 Sim-Suction-Dataset，包括 500 个杂乱环境和 320 万个注释的吸盘抓取姿态。高效的 Sim-Suction-Dataset 生成过程通过将分析模型与动态物理模拟相结合来创建快速而准确的吸盘抓取姿态注释，提供了新的见解。我们引入了 Sim-Suction-Pointnet，通过学习点来生成鲁棒的 6D 吸盘抓取姿态。",
