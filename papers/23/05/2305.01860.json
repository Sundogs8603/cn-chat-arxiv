    "translated_abstract": "对抗性攻击已经开始应用于发现神经排序模型（NRMs）中的潜在漏洞，但是当前攻击方法常常会引入语法错误，无意义的表达，或不连贯的文本片段，这些都很容易被检测到。此外，当前方法严重依赖于使用与真实的NRM相似的模拟NRM来保证攻击效果，这使得它们在实践中难以使用。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个称为“几乎不可察觉文档操作”（IDEM）的框架，用于生成对算法和人类来说都不太明显的对抗文档。IDEM指示一个经过良好建立的生成语言模型（例如BART）生成连接句，而不会引入易于检测的错误，并采用单独的逐位置合并策略来平衡扰动文本的相关性和连贯性。在流行的MS MARCO基准上的实验结果表明，IDEM可以在保持高人类评估得分的同时，优于强基线。",
