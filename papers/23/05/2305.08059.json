    "abstract": "Event-Level Video Question Answering (EVQA) requires complex reasoning across video events to obtain the visual information needed to provide optimal answers. However, despite significant progress in model performance, few studies have focused on using the explicit semantic connections between the question and visual information especially at the event level. There is need for using such semantic connections to facilitate complex reasoning across video frames. Therefore, we propose a semantic-aware dynamic retrospective-prospective reasoning approach for video-based question answering. Specifically, we explicitly use the Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) structure of the question in the dynamic reasoning process where we decide to move to the next frame based on which part of the SRL structure (agent, verb, patient, etc.) of the question is being focused on. We conduct experiments on a benchmark EVQA dataset - TrafficQA. Results show that our proposed approach achieves superior performance ",

    "translated_abstract": "事件级视频问答需要跨越视频事件进行复杂推理，以获取提供最佳答案所需的视觉信息。然而，尽管模型性能取得了显著进展，但很少有研究关注在事件层面上使用问题和视觉信息之间的显式语义联系。有必要利用这种语义联系，促进跨视频帧的复杂推理。因此，我们提出了一种面向视频问答的语义感知动态回顾-前瞻推理方法。具体来说，我们在动态推理过程中明确使用问题的语义角色标注（SRL）结构，根据问题SRL结构的哪一部分（agent、verb、patient等）被关注来决定是否移动到下一帧。我们在基准EVQA数据集——TrafficQA上进行了实验。结果表明，我们提出的方法取得了卓越的性能。",
