    "abstract": "Cross-modal contrastive learning in vision language pretraining (VLP) faces the challenge of (partial) false negatives. In this paper, we study this problem from the perspective of Mutual Information (MI) optimization. It is common sense that InfoNCE loss used in contrastive learning will maximize the lower bound of MI between anchors and their positives, while we theoretically prove that MI involving negatives also matters when noises commonly exist. Guided by a more general lower bound form for optimization, we propose a contrastive learning strategy regulated by progressively refined cross-modal similarity, to more accurately optimize MI between an image/text anchor and its negative texts/images instead of improperly minimizing it. Our method performs competitively on four downstream cross-modal tasks and systematically balances the beneficial and harmful effects of (partial) false negative samples under theoretical guidance.",

    "translated_abstract": "在视觉语言预训练中，跨模态对比学习面临着（部分）误反样本的挑战。本文从 mutual information 优化的角度研究了这个问题。我们理论上证明了在存在噪声的情况下，涉及到负样本的互信息也很重要。我们提出了一种跨模态相似性逐步细化的对比学习策略，以更加精确地优化图像/文本锚点与其负样本文本/图像之间的互信息。我们的方法在四个下游跨模态任务上表现出竞争力，并在理论指导下系统地平衡了（部分）误反样本的有益影响和有害影响。",
