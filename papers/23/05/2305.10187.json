    "translated_abstract": "许多现代科技公司，如Google、Uber和Didi，利用在线实验（也称为A / B测试）评估新政策与现有政策之间的差异。虽然大多数研究集中在平均治疗效应上，但偏斜和重尾的结果分布情况可能会受益于其他标准，例如分位数。然而，在处理来自代步共享平台的数据时，评估动态分位治疗效果（QTE）仍然是一个挑战，因为涉及跨时间和空间的顺序决策。在本文中，我们建立了一个正式框架来计算在治疗独立于特征的条件下的QTE。在特定的模型假设下，我们证明了动态条件QTE（CQTE）等于时间上的个体CQTE之和，尽管累积奖励的条件分位数不一定等于个体奖励的条件分位数之和。这一关键洞察力显著简化了动态CQTE的评估。",
