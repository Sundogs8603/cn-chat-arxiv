    "abstract": "The number of web pages is growing at an exponential rate, accumulating massive amounts of data on the web. It is one of the key processes to classify webpages in web information mining. Some classical methods are based on manually building features of web pages and training classifiers based on machine learning or deep learning. However, building features manually requires specific domain knowledge and usually takes a long time to validate the validity of features. Considering webpages generated by the combination of text and HTML Document Object Model(DOM) trees, we propose a representation and classification method based on a pre-trained language model and graph neural network, named PLM-GNN. It is based on the joint encoding of text and HTML DOM trees in the web pages. It performs well on the KI-04 and SWDE datasets and on practical dataset AHS for the project of scholar's homepage crawling.",

    "translated_abstract": "网页数量呈指数级增长，积累了大量的网络数据。在网络信息挖掘中，对网页进行分类是其中的关键过程。一些经典的方法是基于手动构建网页特征，并基于机器学习或深度学习训练分类器。然而，手动构建特征需要特定领域知识，并且通常需要很长时间验证特征的有效性。考虑到网页是由文本和HTML文档目标模型(DOM)树结合生成的，我们提出了一种基于预训练语言模型和图神经网络的表示和分类方法，称为PLM-GNN。它是基于对网页中文本和HTML DOM树的联合编码实现的。它在KI-04和SWDE数据集以及学者主页爬取项目的实际数据集AHS上表现良好。",
