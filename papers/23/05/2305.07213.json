    "translated_abstract": "尽管已经开发了许多聚类算法，但许多现有方法仍然利用k-means技术来检测数据点的聚类。然而，k-means的性能严重依赖于聚类中心的估计，这很难达到最优解。另一个主要缺点是对噪声和异常数据敏感。在本文中，从流形学习的角度出发，我们重新思考了k-means，并提出了一种新的聚类算法，可以直接检测数据的聚类而不需要均值估计。具体地，我们通过Butterworth滤波器构造数据点之间的距离矩阵，使得同一聚类中任意两个数据点之间的距离等于一个小常数，同时增加来自不同聚类的其他数据对之间的距离。为了充分利用嵌入在不同视图中的补充信息，我们在由指示器矩阵组成的三阶张量上利用了张量Schatten p-范数正则化。",
