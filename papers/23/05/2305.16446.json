    "translated_abstract": "统计散度量化概率分布之间的差异，是机器学习中的一种重要方法。但是，由于数据的底层分布通常未知，从经验样本中估计散度是一个基本难题。本文提出了一种基于再生核希尔伯特空间(RKHS)中协方差算子的新型散度——表示Jensen-Shannon散度。我们的方法将数据分布嵌入到RKHS中，并利用表示的协方差算子的频谱。我们提供了一个从经验协方差矩阵估计的估计函数，它通过使用Fourier特征将数据映射到RKHS中。此估计函数是灵活、可扩展、可微分的，并且适用于小批量优化问题。此外，我们还提供了一种基于核矩阵的估计函数，而不需要对RKHS进行显式映射。我们证明这个量是Jensen-Shannon散度的一个下界。",
