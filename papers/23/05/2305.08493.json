    "abstract": "The rapid advancement in machine learning has led to a surge in automatic data generation, making it increasingly challenging to differentiate between naturally or human-generated data and machine-generated data. Despite these advancements, the generation of creative data remains a challenge. This paper aims to investigate and comprehend the essence of creativity, both in general and within the context of natural language generation. We review various approaches to creative writing devices and tasks, with a specific focus on the generation of poetry. We aim to shed light on the challenges and opportunities in the field of creative data generation.",
