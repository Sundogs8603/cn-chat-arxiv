    "translated_abstract": "在大多数主要城市和城区中，居民沿着种族或社会经济界限形成同质化社区。这种现象被称为住宅分隔，并得到了广泛研究。50年前，谢林提出了一个里程碑式的模型，以优雅的基于代理的方式解释了住宅分隔。最近的一系列论文使用了博弈论方法分析了谢林的模型。然而，所有这些研究都考虑了具有给定数量的离散类型的模型，这些类型建模不同的族群。我们侧重于非分类属性（例如家庭收入或政治左右立场）引起的分离。为此，我们考虑可以表示为实数的代理类型。这打开了多种合理模型的可能性，作为一个概念验证，我们集中在了几个自然候选者身上。特别地，我们认为代理人通过平均类型差异或最大类型差异来评估他们的位置。我们的分析表明，在我们的连续设置中，谢林原始模型中存在的相变也存在。此外，我们引入了可能出现的新现象，诸如角解的存在，在处理非同质人群时可能是至关重要的。",
