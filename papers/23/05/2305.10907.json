In this paper, we propose to extend the task from the perspective of cognitive theory. Instead of a simple flat structure, the steps are typically organized hierarchically - Human often decompose a complex task into subgoals, where each subgoal can be further decomposed into steps. To establish the benchmark, we contribute a new dataset, propose several baseline methods, and set up evaluation metrics. Both automatic and human evaluation verify the high-quality of dataset, as well as the effectiveness of incorporating subgoals into hierarchical script generation. Furthermore, We also design and evaluate the model to discover subgoal, and find that it is a bit more difficult to decompose the goals than summarizing from segmented steps.",

    "translated_abstract": "目标导向的脚本生成是生成能够实现给定目标的步骤列表的新任务。本文提出从认知理论的角度扩展该任务。步骤通常是分层组织的，而不是简单的平面结构——人们常常将复杂的任务分解成子目标，每个子目标可以进一步分解为步骤。为了建立基准，我们贡献了一个新的数据集，提出了几种基准方法，并设置了评估指标。自动和人工评估都验证了数据集的高质量以及将子目标纳入层次脚本生成的有效性。此外，我们还设计和评估了发现子目标的模型，并发现将目标分解成子目标比从分段步骤中总结更为困难。",
