    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在测试投资者情绪与摩洛哥和突尼斯两个新兴金融市场上股票利润之间的关系。使用了两个投资者情绪的间接测量指标，SENT和ARMS。这些情绪指标显示股票回报与投资者情绪之间有重要的关系。事实上，通过过去的观察来模拟投资者情绪的结果表明情绪具有弱记忆性；另一方面，情绪变化的系列具有显著的记忆性。股票回报与投资者情绪之间的Granger因果关系检验结果表明，两个研究的金融市场的收益引起投资者情绪，而不是反过来。通过估计投资者情绪、情绪变化、股票回报和股票回报变化之间的四个自回归关系，我们首先发现回报可以预测情绪变化，这与我们的假设一致。",

Results show that profitability influences investor sentiment in both markets. Additionally, stock returns can predict changes in sentiment."
