    "translated_abstract": "在自适应数据分析中，机制获取n个来自未知分布D的独立同分布样本，并需要对一系列自适应选择的统计查询提供准确的估计。在一个拥有单向函数的基础上，Hardt和Ullman(FOCS 2014)以及Steinke和Ullman(COLT 2015)表明，通常情况下，回答超过Θ(n^2)个适应性查询是计算上困难的。然而，这些负面结果强烈依赖于一个对抗性模型，该模型使得对抗分析员比机制明显处于优势地位，因为选择自适应查询的分析员也选择了基础分布D。这种不平衡会对所得到的难度结果的适用性提出问题——具有基础分布D的完全知识的分析员几乎没有任何必要向仅持有有限数量D样本的机制发出统计查询。",
