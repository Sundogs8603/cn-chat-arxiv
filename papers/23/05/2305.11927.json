    "translated_abstract": "创建计算机视觉模型仍然是一个复杂和繁琐的过程，而使终端用户可以构建、检查和改进这些模型的交互式机器学习模型视角已经在解决这些问题方面取得了一些进展。为了提高具有不同级别机器学习专业技能的终端用户的体验，我们在Sprite的上下文中设计和评估了两个交互式可视化工具，这是一个用于为从视频中抽取的图像创建CV分类和检测模型的系统。我们研究了这些可视化工具如何作为机器学习循环的一部分，帮助用户识别（评估）和选择（规划）模型存在问题的图像，并改善正在训练的模型。我们发现，使用这些可视化工具的用户在更广泛的模型错误类型和一个或多个模型的预测行为的评估和比较方面发现了更多的图像，从而减少了设计师创建和改进CV模型所需的潜在工作量。",
