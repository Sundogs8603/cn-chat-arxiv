    "translated_abstract": "在面部分析领域，准确的标记检测对于各种应用至关重要，包括人脸识别和表情分析等。然而，传统的热力图或坐标回归技术经常面临计算负担和量化误差等挑战。为解决这些问题，我们提出了 KeyPoint Positioning System（KeyPosS），这是一种突破性的面部标记检测框架，与现有方法不同。KeyPosS首次采用真实距离多边定位算法，一种最初用于GPS系统的技术，通过不依赖于计算密集型回归方法实现快速而准确的面部标记检测。该框架利用完全卷积网络预测距离图，计算感兴趣点（POI）与多个锚点之间的距离。通过巧妙地利用这些锚点来三角测量POI的位置，实现面部标记的检测。",
