Voyager interacts with GPT-4 via blackbox queries, which bypasses the need for model parameter fine-tuning. The skills developed by Voyager are temporally extended, interpretable, and compositional, which compounds the agent's abilities rapidly and alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了Voyager，这是一个在Minecraft中持续探索世界、获得多种技能和进行新的发现而无需人类干预的第一个LLM驱动的全能代理。Voyager包括三个关键组件：1)最大化探索的自动课程设置，2)用于存储和检索复杂行为的不断增长的可执行代码技能库，和3)一种通过环境反馈、执行错误和自我验证进行程序改进的新的迭代提示机制。Voyager通过黑盒查询与GPT-4互动，避免了模型参数微调的需要。Voyager开发的技能具有时间延长性、可解释性和组合性，这加快了代理的能力增长并减轻了灾难性遗忘。从经验上看，Voyager表现出强大的上下文型终身学习能力，并在玩Minecraft方面展现了异常的熟练程度。",
