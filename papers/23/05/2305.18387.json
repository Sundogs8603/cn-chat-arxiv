    "translated_abstract": "随着生成对抗网络（GANs）的最近进展，由于其关键特征的广泛应用，吸引了不同领域的研究者的关注。最近的GAN专注于现实主义，然而，对于某些领域，如本项工作，生成超现实的输出并不是首要任务。在此，生成的结果被用作认知组成部分，以增强角色设计师的创造力，为不同的多媒体项目构思新的角色。为了选择最适合这种创意环境的GAN，我们首先比较了不同的GAN架构以及它们在使用单个图形处理单元对新的视觉角色数据集进行从头训练时的性能。我们还探索了替代技术，如迁移学习和数据增强，以克服计算资源限制，这是许多研究人员面临的挑战。此外，还提出了混合方法，将手工草图与GAN生成的输出相结合，以增强创意探索，充分利用人类设计师和自主系统的优势。初步结果表明，GAN确实可以增强角色设计师的创造力，提供新的、多样化的设计选项，同时减少设计时间和工作量。",
