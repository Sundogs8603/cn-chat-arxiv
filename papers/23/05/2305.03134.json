    "translated_abstract": "面板数据模型通常使用固定效应来解释未观测到的异质性。这些固定效应通常是偶然参数，它们的估计器相对于样本大小的平方根收敛缓慢。在最大似然的上下文中，这会导致似然函数的渐近偏差。因此，从渐近有偏的似然函数得出的检验统计量不再遵循其标准极限分布。这会导致检验大小的严重偏差。我们考虑一类具有双向固定效应的动态非线性模型，并提出了一种似然函数的分析偏差校正方法。我们正式证明了从校正后的似然函数得出的似然比、拉格朗日乘数、和 Wald 检验统计量遵循它们的标准渐近分布。作为副产品，校正后的似然函数还可以得出结构参数的偏差校正估计器。我们评估了该方法在 Monte Carlo 模拟中的性能。",
