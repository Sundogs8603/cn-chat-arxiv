    "translated_abstract": "在信息检索系统中，搜索参数会根据一组过去的搜索进行优化以确保高有效性，然后将这些优化参数用作所有后续查询的系统配置。然而，更好的方法是根据实际查询来适应参数。 选择性查询扩展是这种方法之一，其中系统自动决定是否扩展查询，形成两种可能的系统配置。最近，这种方法扩展到包括许多其他参数，从而导致许多可能的系统配置，其中系统在每个查询的基础上自动选择最佳配置。为了确定在实际系统中在每个查询基础上使用的理想配置，我们开发了一种方法，其中预先选择了有限数量的可能配置，然后在元搜索引擎中使用这些配置来确定每个查询的最佳搜索配置。我们为信息检索系统定义了一个风险敏感的查询选择框架，该框架基于预定义的可能配置集确定给定查询的最优系统配置。这种方法可以更有效地利用系统资源并改善搜索性能。",
