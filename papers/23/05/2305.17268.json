    "translated_abstract": "隐喻检测中的一个显著趋势是采用语言学理论，如隐喻识别程序（MIP），用于模型架构设计。虽然MIP明确定义了词汇单位的隐喻性是基于其“上下文含义”和“基本含义”之间的对比来确定的，但现有的工作并没有严格遵循这个原则，通常使用“聚合含义”来近似于目标词的基本含义。本文提出了一种新的隐喻检测方法，它基于训练集中的字面注释对单词的基本含义进行建模，然后将其与目标句子中的上下文含义进行比较以识别隐喻。实验结果表明，我们的方法在F1得分方面显著优于现有方法1.0％。此外，我们的性能甚至达到了带有基本注释的VUA18基准测试的理论上限，这证明了我们方法的有效性。",
