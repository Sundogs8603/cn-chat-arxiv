    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）范式出现为了在模型训练过程中保护数据隐私，仅展示客户端的模型参数而非原始数据。FL 中最大的挑战之一在于分布于客户端的非 IID（不同且独立分布）数据（即数据异构性）。为了解决这个挑战，提出了各种个性化 FL（pFL）方法，例如基于相似性聚合和模型解耦。前者从具有类似数据分布的客户端聚合模型。后者将神经网络（NN）模型解耦为特征提取器和分类器。个性化由分类器捕获，这些分类器是通过本地训练获得的。为了推进 pFL，在本文中提出了一种新的pFedSim（基于模型相似性的pFL）算法，将这两种方法相结合。具体而言，我们将 NN 模型解耦为个性化特征提取器和在每个客户端上本地训练的分类器。我们在各种数据集上评估了我们提出的方法，结果表明我们的方法在异构数据分布下改善了FL的性能。",
