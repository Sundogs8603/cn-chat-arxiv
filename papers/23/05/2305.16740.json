    "translated_abstract": "动词省略是VP并列结构中复杂的句法现象。当动词及其（一些）论元在初始子句中得到明确说明后，在随后的子句中被省略时，就会出现这种现象。恢复这些省略元素对于准确解释句子是必要的，虽然人类很容易而且直观地填充缺失信息，但最先进的模型仍然难以完成这项任务。以往的工作仅限于小规模数据集、合成数据创建方法和依赖图级别的解析方法。在本文中，我们提出了一个直接在文本中操作的并列解析任务，并利用分割和重构范例来恢复并列结构中缺失的元素。为此，我们首先制定了一个实用的动词省略框架，描述了不同类型的省略，并开发了一种自动可扩展的收集方法。基于这种方法，我们整理了一份由真实语料库构成的数据集，用于评估并比较现有解析技术。",
