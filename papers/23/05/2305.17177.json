    "translated_abstract": "在减少财富不平等的方法中，资源在群体内的重新分配是当前的辩论领域。财富共享的进化路径也是一个积极研究的主题。为了研究财富共享的影响和演化，使用了一个复杂的自适应系统的极简模型来模拟社会。这些模拟表明，对于这个人工的采集社会来说，地方资源共享会减少经济总财富，并增加财富不平等。无论全局还是在个人的家族内，进化压力都会强烈选择反对地方共享，选择反对社交行为。通过保持邻居之间共享资源的基因，从富人到穷人，无论是与每个人还是仅在同一家族成员之间，都选择社交行为，但相对于非共享社会，总财富和平均寿命显著降低。Gini系数被证明在测量这些变化方面是无效的。",
