    "abstract": "Hedges are widely studied across registers and disciplines, yet research on the translation of hedges in political texts is extremely limited. This contrastive study is dedicated to investigating whether there is a diachronic change in the frequencies of hedging devices in the target texts, to what extent the changing frequencies of translated hedges through years are attributed to the source texts, and what translation strategies are adopted to deal with them. For the purposes of this research, two types of official political texts and their translations from China and the United Nations were collected to form three sub-corpora. Results show that hedges tend to appear more frequently in English political texts, be it original English or translated English. In addition, directionality seems to play an important role in influencing both the frequencies and translation strategies regarding the use of hedges. A noticeable diachronic increase of hedging devices is also observed in our corp",

    "translated_abstract": "措辞是跨专业领域广泛研究的词汇，但政治文本中措辞的翻译研究极为有限。本文研究了措辞在目标文本中的词频变化是否具有历时性，翻译中措辞通过年份变化的程度如何归因于源文本，并采用了何种翻译策略来处理它们。为了实现这一研究目的，我们收集了来自中国和联合国的两种公务政治文本及其翻译，形成了三个子语料库。结果表明，措辞在英文政治文本中（无论是原始英文还是翻译英文）似乎更频繁出现。此外，翻译方向似乎在影响措辞使用的频率和翻译策略方面起着重要作用。我们还观察到，措辞使用频率在我们的子语料库中出现了显著的历时性增加。",
