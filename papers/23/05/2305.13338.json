    "translated_abstract": "分子生物学家经常解释从高通量实验和计算分析中获得的基因列表。这通常是通过统计富集分析来完成的，该分析测量与基因或其属性相关的生物功能术语的过度或欠表示程度，基于知识库（KB）（例如Gene Ontology（GO））中的编译断言。解释基因列表也可以被构建为一个文本概括任务，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行，可能直接利用科学文本并避免依赖KB。我们开发了SPINDOCTOR（稳定的提示插值的受控术语的自然语言描述的结构化报告模板），一种使用GPT模型执行基因集函数概括的方法，作为标准富集分析的补充。该方法可以使用不同的基因功能信息来源：（1）从鉴定的本体KB注释中获得的结构化文本，（2）从文本挖掘中推断的本体术语，以及（3）直接从非结构化文本中获得的术语。我们在一个1813个基因集的基准数据集上评估了SPINDOCTOR，并展示了使用GPT模型显著改善了现有方法的性能，同时也提高了可解释性，因为它能够生成人类可读的基因功能摘要。",
