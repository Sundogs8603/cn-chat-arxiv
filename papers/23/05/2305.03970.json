    "translated_abstract": "命名实体识别（NER）是自然语言处理（NLP）中的一个基本模块，用于检测带有预定义语义标签的文本。然而，最近的NER研究集中于利用大量额外的数据，包括预训练语料库和集成搜索引擎等。然而，这些方法面临着与数据收集和预训练相关的高成本，以及从搜索引擎检索的数据的额外训练过程。为解决上述问题，我们通过借鉴机器阅读理解（MRC）和它的有效利用现有数据的能力，将NER完全框架为MRC问题，称之为NER-to-MRC。虽然之前的MRC研究致力于使用MRC解决NER问题，但仍存在几个挑战：i）依赖手动设计的提示；ii）限制MRC方法对数据重建的能力，无法达到利用大量额外数据的方法的表现水平。因此，我们的NER-to-MRC方法提出了一种将NER问题重新阐释为MRC中的跨度提取任务的方法，利用了一种新的跨度相关表示学习模块和预训练过程。我们的方法仅使用了一小部分额外数据，就实现了比以前的NER作品更先进的性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a complete solution to the Named-Entity Recognition (NER) problem by framing it as a machine reading comprehension (MRC) problem, called NER-to-MRC. The approach utilizes a novel span-dependent representation learning module and pre-training process, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only a fraction of extra data."
