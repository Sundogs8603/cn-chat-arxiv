    "translated_abstract": "疾病的根本原因直观地对应于增加诊断可能性的根本顶点。然而，这种根本原因的描述缺乏计算机算法发展所需的严格数学公式。在以前的工作中，使用干预主义者帐户定义了疾病的病人特定根本原因，该帐户仅攀升到珍珠的因果Ladder的第二层。在这个理论性的文章中，我们通过提出反事实的定义来攀升到第三层，以匹配基于固定事实数据的临床直觉。然后，我们展示了如何使用可解释的人工智能的Shapley值为每个变量分配根因贡献得分。提出的疾病患者个体根本原因的反事实公式化考虑了噪声标签，适应了疾病的流行率，并允许快速计算，无需反事实模拟。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种针对疾病患者个体的根本原因的新公式，可以用于自动从数据中检测根本原因，并考虑了噪声标签和疾病流行率等因素，同时具有快速计算的优势。",
