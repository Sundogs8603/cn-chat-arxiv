    "title": "Is a Prestigious Job the same as a Prestigious Country? A Case Study on Multilingual Sentence Embeddings and European Countries. (arXiv:2305.14482v1 [cs.CL])",
    "abstract": "We study how multilingual sentence representations capture European countries and how this differs across European languages. We prompt the models with templated sentences that we machine-translate into 12 European languages and analyze the most prominent dimensions in the embeddings. Our analysis reveals that the most prominent country feature in the embedding is its economic strength in terms of GPD. When prompted specifically for job prestige, the embedding space clearly distinguishes high and low-prestige jobs. The occupational dimension is uncorrelated with the most dominant country dimensions for three out of four studied models. One model: Distilled Multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder, however, exhibited a connection between occupational prestige and country of origin, which is a potential source of nationality-based discrimination. Our findings are consistent across languages and, to some extent, with the exception mentioned above, across studied representation models.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了多语句子表示如何捕捉欧洲国家，以及这种差异如何在欧洲语言之间不同。我们用模板句子提示模型，将其机器翻译成12种欧洲语言，并分析嵌入中最突出的维度。我们的分析表明，嵌入中最突出的国家特征是其GPD经济实力。当特别询问声望高低时，嵌入空间清楚地区分了声望高低的工作。三个受研究的模型中的大部分国家维度与职业维度不相关，但Distilled Multilingual Universal Sentence Encoder模型表现出职业声望和原籍国之间的联系，这是一种潜在的基于国籍的歧视。我们的发现在不同的语言中是一致的，并且在一定程度上与上述例外情况下的受研究的表示模型一致。",
