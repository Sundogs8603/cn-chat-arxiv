    "abstract": "We consider a team-production environment where all participants are motivated by career concerns, and where a team's joint productive outcome may have different reputational implications for different team members. In this context, we characterize equilibrium disclosure of team-outcomes when team-disclosure choices aggregate individual decisions through some deliberation protocol. In contrast with individual disclosure problems, we show that equilibria often involve partial disclosure. Furthermore, we study the effort-incentive properties of equilibrium disclosure strategies implied by different deliberation protocols; and show that the partial disclosure of team outcomes may improve individuals' incentives to contribute to the team. Finally, we study the design of deliberation protocols, and characterize productive environments where effort-incentives are maximized by unilateral decision protocols or more consensual deliberation procedures.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一个由职业动机驱动的团队生产环境，在这种环境下，团队共同生产的结果可能对不同团队成员具有不同的声誉影响。在此背景下，我们描述了团队成果披露的均衡策略，其中团队披露选择通过某些协商方案来整合个体决策。与个人信息披露问题不同的是，我们展示了均衡通常涉及部分披露。此外，我们研究了不同协商方案所隐含的均衡披露策略的努力激励性质；并且表明，团队成果的部分披露可能会提高个体为团队做贡献的激励。最后，我们研究了协商方案的设计，并对生产环境进行了描述，这些环境通过单方面决策协议或更加共识性的协商程序来最大化努力激励。",

The study found that partial disclosure is often involved and the partial disclosure of team outcomes may improve individuals' incentives to contribute to the team. Different decision protocols are designed to maximize effort incentives in productive environments."
