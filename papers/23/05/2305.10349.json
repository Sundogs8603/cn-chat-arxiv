    "abstract": "We present a system for interpretable, symbolic, interactive task learning from dialog using a GPT model as a conversational front-end. The learned tasks are represented as hierarchical decompositions of predicate-argument structures with scoped variable arguments. By using a GPT model to convert interactive dialog into a semantic representation, and then recursively asking for definitions of unknown steps, we show that hierarchical task knowledge can be acquired and re-used in a natural and unrestrained conversational environment. We compare our system to a similar architecture using a more conventional parser and show that our system tolerates a much wider variety of linguistic variance.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个系统，利用GPT模型作为对话前端，从对话中进行可解释的符号交互式任务学习。学习到的任务被表示为谓词-参数结构的分层分解，具有作用域变量参数。通过使用GPT模型将交互式对话转换为语义表示，并递归地要求未知步骤的定义，我们展示了分层任务知识可以在自然和不受限制的对话环境中被获取和重复使用。我们将我们的系统与使用更传统的解析器的类似架构进行比较，并展示了我们的系统可以容忍更广泛的语言变异。",
