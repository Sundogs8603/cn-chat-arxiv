    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的方法已经取得了良好的昆虫分类准确性；但是这些模型大多数适用于受控环境下的应用，而在现实的农业领域中往往受到许多因素的干扰。其中一个主要的问题是输入的图像超出分布范围（例如车辆、动物、人类或模糊的昆虫或未经训练的昆虫类的图像）可能会导致错误的分类。OOD检测算法提供了一种解决这些问题的方法，它确保模型不会在非昆虫或未训练的昆虫类图像上进行错误的分类预测。我们生成并评估了最先进的OOD算法在昆虫检测分类器上的性能。这些算法代表了多种方法来解决OOD问题。具体来说，我们评估了基于不确定性、基于特征空间和基于生成模型的三类技术。我们的实验表明，基于生成模型的方法是检测OOD图像最有效的方法，在许多数据集上实现了接近1.0的AUC分数。",
