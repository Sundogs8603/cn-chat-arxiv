    "abstract": "Recent language models have made tremendous progress in the structured data to text generation task. However, these models still give sub-optimal performance where logical inference is required to generate the descriptions. In this work, we specifically focus on analytical text generation from structured data such as tables. Building on the taxonomy proposed in (Gupta et al., 2020) we focus on controllable table to text generation for the following reasoning categories: numerical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, temporal reasoning, table knowledge, and entity knowledge. We propose STOAT model, which is table and reasoning aware, with vector-quantization to infuse the given reasoning categories in the output. We observe that our model provides 10.19%, 1.13% improvement on the PARENT metric in iToTTo and Infotabs for the analytical sentence task. We also found that our model generates 15.3% more faithful and analytical descriptions as compared to the baseline models in human evaluation.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，语言模型在结构化数据到文本生成任务中取得了巨大的进展。然而，当需要进行逻辑推理以生成描述时，这些模型仍然表现出次优的性能。在本文中，我们特别关注从结构化数据（例如表格）生成分析文本。在（Gupta et al.,2020）提出的分类基础上，我们重点关注以下推理类别的可控制表格到文本生成：数字推理、常识推理、时间推理、表格知识和实体知识。我们提出了STOAT模型，该模型具有表格和推理意识，并通过矢量量化将给定的推理类别注入输出中。我们观察到，在分析句子任务中，我们的模型在iToTTo和Infotabs的PARENT指标上分别提供了10.19％和1.13％的优化。我们还发现，与基线模型相比，我们的模型生成的描述更加准确和分析，人类评估中增加了15.3％。",
    "tldr": "STOAT模型是表格和推理意识的生成模型，在数字推理、常识推理、时间推理、表格知识和实体知识方面有较好的控制，提高了分析句子生成的质量和准确度。",
    "en_tdlr": "The STOAT model is a structured data to text generation model with a focus on controllable table-to-text generation for reasoning categories, including numerical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, temporal reasoning, table knowledge, and entity knowledge. The model infuses reasoning categories through vector-quantization and shows significant improvement in the PARENT metric and generates more accurate and analytical descriptions compared to baseline models."
