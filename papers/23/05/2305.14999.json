    "translated_abstract": "链式思维（Chain-of-Thought，CoT）提示能够使大型语言模型解决复杂的推理问题，通过生成中间步骤。然而，受制于其内在的单遍和顺序生成过程，CoT在初始决策上过度依赖，导致早期步骤中的错误累积并影响最终答案。相比之下，人类在处理复杂推理问题时采用递归思维，即将原问题迭代地分解为可处理的子问题，并汇总其答案以解决原问题。受到人类认知过程的启发，我们提出了SOCRATIC QUESTIONING，一种模拟递归思维过程的分而治之算法。具体而言，SOCRATIC QUESTIONING利用大型语言模型提出和回答子问题，直到收集足够的信息来解决原问题。与CoT不同，SOCRATIC QUESTIONING明确地导航思考空间，促进有效的递归思维。",

    "en_tdlr": "SOCRATIC QUESTIONING is an algorithm that utilizes large language models to perform recursive thinking, inspired by the cognitive process of humans. It solves complex reasoning problems by breaking them down into manageable sub-problems and aggregating their answers. This approach improves accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional single-pass generation methods."
