    "translated_abstract": "现有的问答（QA）系统受限于回答未见过的领域或任何领域之外的分布的能力，使它们在部署到真实场景中时不太可靠。更重要的是，所有现有的QA领域适应方法要么基于生成合成数据，要么是伪标记目标领域数据。基于合成数据和伪标记的领域适应方法，要么需要计算资源，要么需要额外的精心选择置信阈值来将非干净的样本从训练数据集中分离出来。在本文中，我们提出了一种无监督的领域适应方法，通过将目标表示转移至接近源领域，同时仍使用源领域的监督进行培训，从而适应标记的目标领域。为此，我们提出了领域不变的调优与对抗性标签糾正的想法，以识别与源域相距较远的目标实例。",
