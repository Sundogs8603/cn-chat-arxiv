    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了多个差动驱动移动机器人的分布式领航者跟随者编队控制问题。首先引入了分布式估计器，它仅需要每个跟随者自身和其相邻机器人的状态信息。然后，我们提出了一种基于生物启发式神经动力学的反步和滑模控制混合编队控制方法，并证明了其稳定性。所提出的控制策略解决了传统反步设计中存在的不切实际的速度跳跃问题。此外，考虑到系统和测量噪声，所提出的控制策略不仅消除了传统滑模控制中存在的抖动问题，还提供了额外的鲁棒性和平滑的控制输入。然后，将自适应滑模创新滤波器与所提出的控制结合起来，以提供鲁棒的状态估计，能够克服建模不确定性。最后，我们进行了多次仿真来演示创新方法的有效性。",
