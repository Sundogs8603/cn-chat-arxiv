    "translated_abstract": "本文采用Wordle游戏中猜测次数的分布和期望作为衡量词语难度的度量标准，并探究了影响词语难度的因素。我们利用Monte Carlo模拟玩家的猜测过程预测难度分布，利用Markov来生成词语的关联性，缩小每个词语猜测次数的实际分布与原始分布之间的差距，然后使用套索回归预测猜测次数期望的偏差，并利用二次规划获得原始分布的修正。我们首先使用分层聚类方法将词语按猜测次数期望值分为不同的难度级别，然后利用因子分析降低词汇属性变量的数量，显著的因素包括邻近词汇的数量、字母相似性、子串相似性和词频。最后，我们使用线性回归模型建立了上述影响因素与词语难度之间的关系。",
