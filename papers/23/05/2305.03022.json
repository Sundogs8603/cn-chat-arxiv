    "abstract": "Clustering is at the very core of machine learning, and its applications proliferate with the increasing availability of data. However, as datasets grow, comparing clusterings with an adjustment for chance becomes computationally difficult, preventing unbiased ground-truth comparisons and solution selection. We propose FastAMI, a Monte Carlo-based method to efficiently approximate the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) and extend it to the Standardized Mutual Information (SMI). The approach is compared with the exact calculation and a recently developed variant of the AMI based on pairwise permutations, using both synthetic and real data. In contrast to the exact calculation our method is fast enough to enable these adjusted information-theoretic comparisons for large datasets while maintaining considerably more accurate results than the pairwise approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "聚类是机器学习的核心，随着数据可用性的增加，其应用日益增多。然而，随着数据集的增长，带有偶然性调整的聚类比较变得计算困难，导致没有偏见的真实比较和解决方案选择。我们提出了FastAMI，一种基于蒙特卡罗的方法，用于高效地估计经过调整的互信息（AMI）并将其扩展到标准化互信息（SMI）。与准确计算相比，我们的方法足够快，可以为大型数据集启用这些带有调整的信息论比较，同时保持比配对方法更准确的结果。",
