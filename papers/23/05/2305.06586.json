    "abstract": "We present the findings of SemEval-2023 Task 2 on Fine-grained Multilingual Named Entity Recognition (MultiCoNER 2). Divided into 13 tracks, the task focused on methods to identify complex fine-grained named entities (like WRITTENWORK, VEHICLE, MUSICALGRP) across 12 languages, in both monolingual and multilingual scenarios, as well as noisy settings. The task used the MultiCoNER V2 dataset, composed of 2.2 million instances in Bangla, Chinese, English, Farsi, French, German, Hindi, Italian., Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, and Ukrainian. MultiCoNER 2 was one of the most popular tasks of SemEval-2023. It attracted 842 submissions from 47 teams, and 34 teams submitted system papers. Results showed that complex entity types such as media titles and product names were the most challenging.

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了SemEval-2023任务2关于细粒度多语言命名实体识别（MultiCoNER 2）的研究发现。该任务分为13个轨道，重点关注12种语言和单语、多语和嘈杂环境下识别复杂的细粒度命名实体（如WRITTENWORK、VEHICLE、MUSICALGRP）的方法。任务使用MultiCoNER V2数据集，该数据集由Bangla、Chinese、English、Farsi、French、German、Hindi、Italian、Portuguese、Spanish、Swedish和Ukrainian组成，共有220万个实例。MultiCoNER 2是SemEval-2023中最受欢迎的任务之一，吸引了47个队伍提交842个结果，其中34个队伍提交了系统论文。结果表明，媒体标题和产品名称等复杂实体类型是最具挑战性的，将外部知识融入transformer模型的方法取得了最佳性能，并且在Creative Work和Group类别上获得了最大增益，即使使用外部知识仍然具有挑战性。",
