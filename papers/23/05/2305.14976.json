    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT的出现标志着NLP领域的一次变革，尤其在许多英文基准测试中表现出色。然而，该模型在不同语言背景下的有效性仍然是未知领域。本研究旨在填补这一知识空白，重点评估ChatGPT在阿拉伯语言和方言上的能力。我们进行了一项大规模的自动化和人工评估研究，涵盖了44个不同的语言理解和生成任务，涉及60多个不同的数据集。据我们所知，这是对ChatGPT在Arabic NLP中进行的首次全面性性能分析。我们的研究结果表明，尽管在英语上表现出色，但ChatGPT在阿拉伯语上的性能始终不如经过阿拉伯语微调的较小模型。我们进一步对比了ChatGPT和GPT-4在现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）和方言阿拉伯语（DA）上的性能，揭示了...",
