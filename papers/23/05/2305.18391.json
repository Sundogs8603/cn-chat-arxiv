    "translated_abstract": "网络文化表情包是一种在社交媒体和互联网上流行的传播趋势和观点的形式，结合了图像和文本的模式。它们可以表达幽默和讽刺，但也可能含有冒犯性的内容。自动分析和分类网络文化表情包具有挑战性，因为其解释依赖于对视觉元素、语言和背景知识的理解。因此，重要的是有意义地表示这些来源以及它们之间的交互，以便将表情包作为整体分类。在这项工作中，我们提出使用场景图作为表示图像中物体及其视觉关系的结构化表达方式，并将知识图谱作为网络文化表情包分类的结构化表示，使用基于Transformer的架构。我们将我们的方法与ImgBERT进行比较，后者使用仅学习（而不是结构化）的表达式进行多模式建模，我们观察到始终有所改善。我们还提供了一个具有人工图注释的数据集，供比较。",
