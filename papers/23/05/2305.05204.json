    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统往往受到流行度偏见的影响，过度推荐热门物品，而牺牲不受欢迎的物品。现有的研究通常关注如何确保每个物品的推荐次数暴露在相等或成比例的情况下,使用反向偏差加权、因果干预或对抗训练等方法。然而，增加不受欢迎物品的曝光率可能不会带来更多的点击或交互，导致利益分配不平衡，无法真正实现合理的流行度鉴别。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的流行度鉴别准则，即在一个公平的推荐系统中，受欢迎和不受欢迎的物品应该得到与喜欢它的用户数量成比例的交互。在该准则的指导下，我们提出了一种带有IPL正则化项的去偏差框架，该框架在理论上可以实现流行度去偏差和推荐性能的双赢局面。在几个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，我们的方法优于几个最先进的基线模型，并在去偏差性能和推荐准确性方面取得了显着的改进。",
