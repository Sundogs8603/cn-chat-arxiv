    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于大语言模型的 URL 分类方法，旨在实现网络内容过滤的主要目标：保障组织免受法律和伦理风险，限制访问高风险或可疑网站，以及促进安全的专业工作环境。我们的方法利用大语言模型生成准确的分类，并利用已有的知识蒸馏技术创建更小、更专业的学生模型，以用于网络内容过滤。在将通过大型安全供应商收集的客户遥测数据的 30 个不同内容类别的网站进行分类的任务中，我们的学生模型通过蒸馏结果实现了 9% 的分类精度提升，超过了当前最先进方法。我们的学生模型在参数数量上与原始的大语言模型相比减少了 175 倍，从而达到了与老师模型相匹配的性能，可以用于大规模的在线扫描。",
