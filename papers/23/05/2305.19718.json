    "translated_abstract": "在现实任务中，通常存在大量未标记数据和标记数据。将两者组合起来进行学习的任务被称为半监督学习。专家可以使用逻辑规则来标记未标记数据，但这个操作很昂贵。感知和推理的结合在处理具有领域知识的半监督任务方面具有良好的效果。然而，获取领域知识以及规则的修正、减少和生成仍然是需要解决的复杂问题。粗糙集理论是解决信息系统中知识处理的重要方法。本文提出了一种粗糙集下的规则通用逆推学习方法（RS-ABL）。通过将规则的目标概念和子概念转化为信息表，利用粗糙集理论来解决以更低的成本获取领域知识和修正、减少、生成规则的问题。该框架还可以生成更广泛的负规则，以增强规则范围。",
