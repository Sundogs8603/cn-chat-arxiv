    "abstract": "Event schema provides a conceptual, structural and formal language to represent events and model the world event knowledge. Unfortunately, it is challenging to automatically induce high-quality and high-coverage event schemas due to the open nature of real-world events, the diversity of event expressions, and the sparsity of event knowledge. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for event schema induction -- knowledge harvesting from large-scale pre-trained language models, which can effectively resolve the above challenges by discovering, conceptualizing and structuralizing event schemas from PLMs. And an Event Schema Harvester (ESHer) is designed to automatically induce high-quality event schemas via in-context generation-based conceptualization, confidence-aware schema structuralization and graph-based schema aggregation. Empirical results show that ESHer can induce high-quality and high-coverage event schemas on varying domains.",

    "translated_abstract": "事件模式提供了一种概念性、结构性和形式化的语言，用于表示事件和对世界事件知识进行建模。然而，由于真实世界事件的开放性、事件表达形式的多样性以及事件知识的稀疏性，自动诱导高质量和高覆盖范围的事件模式仍然具有挑战性。本文提出了一种新的事件模式诱导范式——从大型预训练语言模型中获取知识，通过从PLM中发现、概念化和结构化事件模式来有效解决上述挑战。并设计了事件模式收割机（ESHer），通过上下文生成的概念化、置信度感知的架构化以及基于图形的模式聚合来自动诱导高质量的事件模式。实验结果表明，ESHer可以在不同领域诱导高质量和高覆盖范围的事件模式。",
