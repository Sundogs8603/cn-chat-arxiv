    "translated_abstract": "半监督异常检测(SSAD)方法通过利用少量但有指导作用的异常实例，增强了无监督异常检测(UAD)的效果。然而，同质正常数据对异常的统治使得SSAD模型无法有效地感知异常。为了解决这个问题并在严重不平衡的正常和异常数据之间实现平衡的监督，我们开发了一个名为AnoOnly(仅异常)的新框架。与现有的SSAD方法不同，AnoOnly暂停了严格的损失监督，引入了一种对正常数据的弱监督形式。这种弱监督通过批量归一化实现，隐式地对正常数据进行聚类学习。当集成到现有的SSAD方法中时，所提出的AnoOnly在各种模型和数据集上展示了显著的性能提升，达到了新的最佳性能。此外，我们的A",
