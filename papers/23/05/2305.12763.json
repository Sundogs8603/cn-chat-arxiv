    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) like GPT become increasingly prevalent, it is essential that we assess their capabilities beyond language processing. This paper examines the economic rationality of GPT by instructing it to make budgetary decisions in four domains: risk, time, social, and food preferences. We measure economic rationality by assessing the consistency of GPT decisions with utility maximization in classic revealed preference theory. We find that GPT decisions are largely rational in each domain and demonstrate higher rationality scores than those of humans reported in the literature. We also find that the rationality scores are robust to the degree of randomness and demographic settings such as age and gender, but are sensitive to contexts based on the language frames of the choice situations. These results suggest the potential of LLMs to make good decisions and the need to further understand their capabilities, limitations, and underlying mechanisms.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着像GPT这样的大型语言模型越来越普遍，评估它们在语言处理之外的能力至关重要。本文通过指示GPT在风险、时间、社交和食品偏好的四个领域中进行预算决策来研究GPT的经济理性。我们通过评估GPT决策与古典揭示偏好理论中的效用最大化一致性来衡量经济理性。我们发现GPT在每个领域的决策基本上是合理的，并且表现出比文献报道的人类更高的理性得分。我们还发现，理性得分对于随机程度和人口统计学设置（如年龄和性别）是稳健的，但对基于选择情境的语言框架的上下文敏感。这些结果表明了LLM作出良好决策的潜力，以及需要进一步了解它们的能力、局限性和基本机制。",
