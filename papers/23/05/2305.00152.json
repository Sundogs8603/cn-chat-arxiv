    "translated_abstract": "目前，关于转移学习或领域自适应的理论研究主要关注已知假设类或模型的情况；然而，在实践中，通常涉及一定程度的模型选择，这经常出现在超参数调整的总体范畴下：例如，我们可以考虑调整针对目标任务的正确神经网络架构的问题，同时利用来自相关源任务的数据。除了与模型选择有关的近似与估计误差的通常权衡之外，这个问题还带来了新的复杂度，即源分布与目标分布之间的转移距离，这个距离随着假设类的选择而发生变化。我们首次研究了这个问题，重点关注分类问题。特别的，分析揭示了一些引人注目的现象：自适应速率，即没有分布式信息时可达到的速率，可以任意慢于oracle速率，即在给定知识的情况下。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文介绍了在转移学习下模型选择存在的限制，其转移距离会影响自适应速率，可能导致速率较慢。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents the limitations of model selection under transfer learning, where the transfer distance between source and target distributions affects the adaptive rates and may lead to slower rates."
