    "translated_abstract": "出租车需求预测是机器学习的重要应用，它可以使出租车提供设施优化其运营，城市规划者改善交通基础设施和服务。然而，这些系统中使用敏感数据引发了隐私和安全方面的担忧。在本文中，我们提出了使用联合学习进行出租车需求预测，允许多个参与方在保持数据私密和安全的同时训练机器学习模型。这可以使组织在不得以获取数据的情况下构建模型。尽管联合学习为出租车需求预测带来了潜在的益处，但它也面临着一些技术挑战，例如类别不平衡，某些参与方的数据稀缺以及需要确保模型泛化以适应不同的设施和地理区域。为了有效地应对这些挑战，我们提出了一个系统，利用区域无关的编码进行地理特征处理，自适应正则化来平衡数据稀缺，以及数据增强来解决类别不平衡问题。我们在真实的时空出租车需求数据集上评估了我们的方法，并展示了它在保护隐私和保持数据效用方面达到了有竞争力的表现。",
