    "translated_abstract": "文本到图像模型（T2I）通过自然语言引导创作过程，提供了新的灵活性水平。然而，将这些模型个性化以与用户提供的视觉概念相一致仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。T2I 个性化的任务面临多个困难挑战，例如在允许创意控制的同时保持高度视觉保真度，将多个个性化概念组合在单个图像中，以及保持小型模型尺寸。我们提出了一种名为“Perfusion”的 T2I 个性化方法，它使用基础 T2I 模型的动态秩-1更新来解决这些挑战。Perfusion 通过将新概念的交叉关注键“锁定”到其上位类别来避免过度拟合。此外，我们开发了一种门控秩-1方法，使我们能够在推理时间内控制所学概念的影响，并组合多个概念。这允许运行时有效地平衡视觉保真度和文本对齐。",
