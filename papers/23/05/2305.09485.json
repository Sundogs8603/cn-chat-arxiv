    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了行政人员沟通中的发声笑声以及它对社会认可的影响。我们将笑声，情感作为信息和信息媒介对公司的社会评价的研究相结合，假设行政人员沟通中的发声笑声对社会认可有积极影响，社会认可是指受众对一个组织的亲和力的感知。我们认为，与众笑的效果尤其强，即在给定的沟通场合中，聚焦的行政人员和观众同时发笑的次数。最后，结合情感作为信息和人类认知的负面偏见，我们假设笑声对社会认可的积极影响随着组织业绩的下降而增加。我们在902个德国巴林德斯利加足球新闻发布会和媒体十大数据中进行测试，应用最先进的机器学习方法进行笑声检测，并找到了部分支持我们想法的结果。",
