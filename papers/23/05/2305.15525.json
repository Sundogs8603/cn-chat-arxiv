    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can capture rich representations of concepts that are useful for real-world tasks. However, language alone is limited. While existing LLMs excel at text-based inferences, health applications require that models be grounded in numerical data (e.g., vital signs, laboratory values in clinical domains; steps, movement in the wellness domain) that is not easily or readily expressed as text in existing training corpus. We demonstrate that with only few-shot tuning, a large language model is capable of grounding various physiological and behavioral time-series data and making meaningful inferences on numerous health tasks for both clinical and wellness contexts. Using data from wearable and medical sensor recordings, we evaluate these capabilities on the tasks of cardiac signal analysis, physical activity recognition, metabolic calculation (e.g., calories burned), and estimation of stress reports and mental health screeners.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)在捕捉实现实际任务中有用的丰富概念表示方面表现出色。然而，仅有语言的模型具有局限性。健康应用要求模型在数字数据(例如，临床领域中的生命体征、实验室值；在健康领域中的步数、运动)中具有良好的推理能力，而这些数字数据在现有训练语料中很难或不能用文本轻松表达。我们证明，只需进行少量调整，大型语言模型便能够将各种生理和行为时间序列数据与多种健康任务联系起来，适用于临床和健康环境。使用可穿戴设备和医疗传感器记录的数据，我们评估了这些能力，并应用于心脏信号分析、物理活动识别、代谢计算(例如，燃烧的卡路里)以及压力报告和心理健康筛查的估计任务。",
