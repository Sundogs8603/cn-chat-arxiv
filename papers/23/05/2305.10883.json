    "translated_abstract": "视频辅助下的经口气管插管需要使用支持医生将气管导管插入声门而不是食管的内窥镜。越来越多基于机器人的气管插管需要医疗机器人像经验丰富的医生一样区分解剖特征，这可以通过使用监督深度学习技术来模仿。然而口咽器官的真实数据集往往由于开源数据受限和患者隐私问题而难以获取。在本研究中，我们提出了一种领域自适应的Sim-to-Real框架，称为IoU-Ranking Blend-ArtFlow (IRB-AF)，用于口咽器官的图像分割。该框架包括一种称为IoU-Ranking Blend (IRB)的图像融合策略和风格转移方法ArtFlow。其中，IRB通过减轻数据集之间重要的领域差异所导致的实现分割性能差的问题。而ArtFlow则可进一步降低数据集之间的差异性。 本研究采用一种虚拟口咽模型进行实验，结果表明提出的方法可以取得非常好的口咽器官分割效果。",
