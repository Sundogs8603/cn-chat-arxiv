    "translated_abstract": "任务导向的对话系统通常会将其响应基于外部知识库（KB）。这些KB可能是动态的，可能经常更新。现有的学习TOD代理的方法假定在训练期间，可用于每个单独对话的KB快照是可用的。然而，在实际情况下，只有最新的KB快照可用于训练，因此，训练对话可能包含与最新KB冲突的事实。在训练数据中的这些对话-KB不一致可能会使TOD代理学习算法混淆。在这项工作中，我们定义了在训练数据中具有对话-KB不一致性的学习TOD代理的新问题。我们提出了一种对话-KB仲裁框架（DKAF），通过预测每个训练对话的当代KB快照来减少对话-KB不一致性。然后，这些预测的KB快照用于训练下游TOD代理。由于没有对话-KB不一致的现有数据集，我们还创建了一个新的基准来评估存在这种不一致性的TOD代理。新基准上的实验结果表明，我们提出的DKAF方法优于现有基线，并提高了TOD代理抵御对话-KB不一致性的鲁棒性。",
