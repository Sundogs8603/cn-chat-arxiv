    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种使用称为“推断矩”的一组量来分析不确定多变量系统行为的新范式。边缘化是一种不确定性量化过程，它通过平均条件概率来量化所关注概率的期望值。推断矩是描述分布预计如何响应新信息的高阶条件概率矩。本文研究了推断偏差，它是期望的概率波动，随着推断更新另一个变量而发生变化。我们以推断矩的形式找到了互信息的幂级数展开式，这意味着推断矩逻辑可能对通常使用信息论工具执行的任务有用。我们在两个应用中探讨了贝叶斯网络的推断偏差，以改善情境感知能力。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new paradigm for analyzing the behavior of uncertain multivariable systems using inferential moments. The inferential deviation is of particular interest and is explored through power series expansion of mutual information. The approach offers potential benefits for using information theoretic tools and improving situational awareness through analysis of Bayesian Networks."
