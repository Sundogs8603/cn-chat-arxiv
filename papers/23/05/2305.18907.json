There have been proposed multi-task learning settings, which use depression and emotion (or figurative language) as the primary and auxiliary tasks respectively.

To address these limitations, we present the first study, which exploits two different datasets collected under different conditions, and introduce two multitask learning frameworks, which use depression and stress as the main and auxiliary tasks respectively.

    "translated_abstract": "当今社交媒体为人们表达情感提供了宝贵的信息来源，而压力和抑郁在现代人生活的快节奏下变得普遍。尽管已经有许多研究致力于早期识别压力和抑郁，但仍存在一些限制。一些多任务学习模式被提出，将抑郁和情绪（或形象化语言）作为主任务和辅助任务，然而研究人员将压力和抑郁视为两个独立的任务。为了解决这些限制，我们首次提出了一项研究，利用两个在不同条件下收集的数据集，并介绍了两种多任务学习框架，其中抑郁为主任务，压力为辅助任务。具体而言，我们使用了一个抑郁数据集和一个压力数据集。",
