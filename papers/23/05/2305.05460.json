    "translated_abstract": "为了公正地招聘高校和研究机构的教育人员，根据全球公认的学术品质特征确定正确的衡量标准是一个十分微妙、富有挑战性但非常重要的问题。在这一连串的两篇论文中，我们考虑了第一篇论文中的学术品质量化建模部分，而在第二篇论文中考虑了案例研究部分。针对学术品质量化建模，我们开发了两个可用于构建决策支持工具的计算框架：(i) 基于优化的框架，以及 (ii) 基于孪生网络的框架（一种人工神经网络类型）。两个模型的输出都是一个称为学术品质量指数(Academic Quality Index, AQI)的单一指标，它是总体学术品质的度量标准。我们使用全球第一和平均非第一类大学的学者数据，根据《泰晤士高等教育世界大学排名》和 QS 世界大学排名进行假设。",
