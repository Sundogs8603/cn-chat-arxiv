We present a computational model of word recognition which formalizes this perceptual process in Bayesian decision theory. We fit this model to explain scalp EEG signals recorded as subjects passively listened to a fictional story, revealing both the dynamics of the online auditory word recognition process and the neural correlates of the recognition and integration of words.  The model reveals distinct neural processing of words depending on whether or not they can be quickly recognized. While all words trigger a neural response characteristic of probabilistic integration -- voltage modulations predicted by a word's surprisal in context -- these modulations are amplified for words which require more than roughly 100 ms of input to be recognized. We observe no difference in the latency of these neural responses according to words",

    "translated_abstract": "听者通过将有关即将出现的内容的期望与增量感知证据相结合，来快速识别和整合嘈杂的日常语音中的单词。我们提出了一个单词识别的计算模型，该模型在贝叶斯决策理论中形式化了这一知觉过程。我们将该模型拟合到作为被试者被动听取虚构故事时记录的头皮脑电信号中，揭示了在线听觉单词识别过程和单词识别和整合的神经相关性的动力学。该模型揭示了单词的不同神经处理，具体取决于它们是否可以快速识别。虽然所有单词都触发概率整合的神经响应，即文本背景中对单词惊异度预测的电压调制，但对于需要超过大约100ms的输入才能被识别的单词，这些调制会被放大。我们观察到这些神经响应的潜伏期不会根据单词长度而有所不同。",
