    "abstract": "Explaining predictions based on multivariate time series data carries the additional difficulty of handling not only multiple features, but also time dependencies. It matters not only what happened, but also when, and the same feature could have a very different impact on a prediction depending on this time information. Previous work has used perturbation-based saliency methods to tackle this issue, perturbing an input using a trainable mask to discover which features at which times are driving the predictions. However these methods introduce fixed perturbations, inspired from similar methods on static data, while there seems to be little motivation to do so on temporal data. In this work, we aim to explain predictions by learning not only masks, but also associated perturbations. We empirically show that learning these perturbations significantly improves the quality of these explanations on time series data.",

    "translated_abstract": "解释基于多元时间序列数据的预测具有额外的困难，需要处理多个特征以及时间依赖关系。先前的工作使用基于扰动的显著性方法来解决这个问题，通过使用可训练的掩码扰动输入，发现哪些特征在哪个时刻驱动了预测。然而，这些方法引入了固定的扰动，受到静态数据类似方法的启发，而似乎在时间上没有什么动机这样做。在这项工作中，我们旨在通过学习关联扰动，而不仅仅是掩码，来解释预测。我们从实证上证明，学习这些扰动显着提高了时间序列数据的解释质量。",
