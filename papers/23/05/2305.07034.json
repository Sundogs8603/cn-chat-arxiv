Recognizing the recitation of the Holy Quran automatically is a challenging task due to its unique rules that are not applied in normal speaking speeches.

    "translated_abstract": "古兰经是伊斯兰教的圣书，其朗诵是该宗教信仰的一个重要方面。由于古兰经的独特规则不适用于正常的演讲，所以自动识别古兰经的朗诵是一项具有挑战性的任务。在此之前，已进行了许多研究，但以往的研究将朗诵错误检测视为分类任务或使用传统的自动语音识别（ASR）。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的基于端到端深度学习模型来识别古兰经的朗诵。该模型是一个CNN-Bidirectional GRU编码器，使用CTC作为目标函数和基于字符的解码器，即波束搜索解码器。此外，所有以往的研究都是在由短节和几章古兰经组成的小型私人数据集上进行的。由于使用私人数据集，因此没有进行任何比较。为了解决这个问题，我们使用了最近发布的公共数据集（Ar-DAD）作为实验数据。",
