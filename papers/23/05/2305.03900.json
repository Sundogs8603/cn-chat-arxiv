    "abstract": "Imbalance learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on learning tasks in the presence of class imbalance. Nearly all existing studies refer to class imbalance as a proportion imbalance, where the proportion of training samples in each class is not balanced. The ignorance of the proportion imbalance will result in unfairness between/among classes and poor generalization capability. Previous literature has presented numerous methods for either theoretical/empirical analysis or new methods for imbalance learning. This study presents a new taxonomy of class imbalance in machine learning with a broader scope. Four other types of imbalance, namely, variance, distance, neighborhood, and quality imbalances between/among classes, which may exist in machine learning tasks, are summarized. Two different levels of imbalance including global and local are also presented. Theoretical analysis is used to illustrate the significant impact of the new imbalance types on learning fairness. ",

    "translated_abstract": "不平衡学习是机器学习的一个子领域，它关注存在类别不平衡的学习任务。几乎所有现有的研究都将类别不平衡定义为比例不平衡，即每个类别的训练样本比例不平衡，而忽视比例不平衡会导致类别之间/之间的不公平以及泛化能力差。本研究提出了一个更广泛的机器学习类别不平衡分类方式，包括方差、距离、邻近和质量等四种不平衡类型。本研究还介绍了两种不平衡级别:全局和局部。该研究使用理论分析来说明新的不平衡类型对学习公平性的重要影响。",
