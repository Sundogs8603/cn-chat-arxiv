Our main contributions are theoretical and tackle major issues in geometric deep learning such as equivariance and invariance under geometric transformations. Namely, we enrich the recently developed theory of steerable 3D spherical neurons -- SO(3)-equivariant filter banks based on neurons with spherical decision surfaces -- by extending said neurons to nD, which we call deep equivariant hyperspheres, and enabling their stacking in multiple layers. Using the ModelNet40 benchmark, we experimentally verify our theoretical contributions and show a potential practical configuration of the proposed equivariant hyperspheres.",
