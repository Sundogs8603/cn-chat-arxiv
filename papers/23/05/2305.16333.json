    "abstract": "Aiming at reducing the reliance on expensive human annotations, data synthesis for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has remained an active area of research. While prior work mainly focuses on synthetic speech generation for ASR data augmentation, its combination with text generation methods is considerably less explored. In this work, we explore text augmentation for ASR using large-scale pre-trained neural networks, and systematically compare those to traditional text augmentation methods. The generated synthetic texts are then converted to synthetic speech using a text-to-speech (TTS) system and added to the ASR training data. In experiments conducted on three datasets, we find that neural models achieve 9%-15% relative WER improvement and outperform traditional methods. We conclude that text augmentation, particularly through modern neural approaches, is a viable tool for improving the accuracy of ASR systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了减少对昂贵人工注释的依赖，数据增广一直是自动语音识别（ASR）领域的一个热门研究方向。先前的研究主要侧重于用于ASR数据增广的合成语音生成，而其与文本生成方法的结合却相对较少探索。在本文中，我们使用大规模预训练的神经网络探索文本增广对ASR的影响，并将其与传统文本增广方法进行了系统比较。生成的合成文本然后通过文本到语音（TTS）系统转换为合成语音，并添加到ASR训练数据中。我们在三个数据集上进行的实验发现，神经模型实现了9％-15％的相对WER改进，并优于传统方法。我们得出结论，特别是通过现代神经方法，文本增广是提高ASR系统准确性的一种可行工具。",
