    "abstract": "We build a new measure of credit and financial market sentiment using Natural Language Processing on Twitter data. We find that the Twitter Financial Sentiment Index (TFSI) correlates highly with corporate bond spreads and other price- and survey-based measures of financial conditions. We document that overnight Twitter financial sentiment helps predict next day stock market returns. Most notably, we show that the index contains information that helps forecast changes in the U.S. monetary policy stance: a deterioration in Twitter financial sentiment the day ahead of an FOMC statement release predicts the size of restrictive monetary policy shocks. Finally, we document that sentiment worsens in response to an unexpected tightening of monetary policy.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们利用自然语言处理技术从Twitter数据中构建了一个新的信贷和金融市场情绪指数。我们发现，Twitter金融情绪指数（TFSI）与公司债券利差和其他基于价格和调查的金融状况指数高度相关。我们证明，隔夜Twitter金融情绪有助于预测第二天的股市回报。尤其值得一提的是，我们展示了该指数包含的信息有助于预测美国货币政策立场的变化：在FOMC声明发布前一天，Twitter金融情绪的恶化预示着紧缩货币政策冲击的大小。最后，我们证明，情绪会在对货币政策意外的收紧做出反应时恶化。",

Most importantly, it can predict changes in US monetary policies and reflect the market's response to monetary policy tightening."
