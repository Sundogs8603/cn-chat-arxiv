    "translated_abstract": "本文受到语言模型在常识规划任务中具有新兴推理能力的声称的启发，旨在研究其规划能力。我们的目标是评估LLMs在自主生成常识规划任务中的计划效果和LLMs作为其他智能体（AI规划者）在其规划任务中启发性指导的潜力。我们通过生成一套与国际计划竞赛中使用的相似领域的实例进行系统研究，并在两种不同的模式下评估LLMs：自主和启发式。我们的研究结果显示，LLMs自主生成可执行计划的能力相当有限，最佳模型（GPT-4）在领域中的平均成功率约为12%。然而，启发式模式下的结果显示了更有前途的迹象。在启发式模式下，我们证明LLM生成的计划可以改善基础规划器的搜索过程和结果。",
