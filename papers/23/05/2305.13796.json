Each SDE corresponds to a probabilistic flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE), and the trajectory of the PF-ODE solution consists of the speech states at different moments. Our approach is based on consistency model that ensure any speech states on the same PF-ODE trajectory, correspond to the same initial state. By integrating the Brownian Bridge process, the model is able to generate high-intelligibility speech samples without adversarial training. This is the first attempt that applies the consistency models to SE task, achieving state-of-the-art results in several metrics while saving 15 x the time required for sampling compared to the diffusion-based baseline.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种名为SE-Bridge的新型语音增强方法。在最近将扩散模型应用于语音增强之后，我们可以通过解决随机微分方程（SDE）来实现语音增强。每个SDE对应一个概率流普通微分方程（PF-ODE），PF-ODE解的轨迹由不同时刻的语音状态组成。我们的方法基于一致性模型，该模型确保同一PF-ODE轨迹上的任何语音状态对应于同一初始状态。通过集成布朗桥过程，该模型能够生成高可懂性的语音样本，无需敌对训练。这是第一次将一致性模型应用于SE任务，在多个指标上实现了最先进的结果，同时相对于基于扩散的基线，节省了15倍的采样时间。我们在多个数据集上的实验证明了SE-Bridge在SE中的有效性。此外，我们还展示了我们提出的方法在看护机器人任务中的应用。",
