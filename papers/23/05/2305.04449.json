    "translated_abstract": "从家庭护理到仓库配送再到外科手术助理等领域，应用需要机器人可靠地操纵三维可塑物体的形状。弹性三维可塑物体的分析模型需要大量参数来描述决定物体形状的可能无限自由度。以往的3D形状控制尝试依赖于手工特征来表示物体形状，并需要训练物体特定的控制模型。我们通过使用我们的新型DeformerNet神经网络架构来克服这些问题，该架构在被操纵物体的部分视图点云和目标形状的点云上运行，学习物体形状的低维表示。这个形状嵌入使机器人能够学习一种视觉伺服控制器，该控制器计算出所需的机器人末端执行器动作，将物体迭代地变形向目标形状。我们在仿真和真实机器人上演示了这一点。",
