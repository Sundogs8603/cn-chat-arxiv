    "abstract": "Accurate estimation of multiple quality variables is critical for building industrial soft sensor models, which have long been confronted with data efficiency and negative transfer issues. Methods sharing backbone parameters among tasks address the data efficiency issue; however, they still fail to mitigate the negative transfer problem. To address this issue, a balanced Mixture-of-Experts (BMoE) is proposed in this work, which consists of a multi-gate mixture of experts (MMoE) module and a task gradient balancing (TGB) module. The MoE module aims to portray task relationships, while the TGB module balances the gradients among tasks dynamically. Both of them cooperate to mitigate the negative transfer problem. Experiments on the typical sulfur recovery unit demonstrate that BMoE models task relationship and balances the training process effectively, and achieves better performance than baseline models significantly.",

    "translated_abstract": "准确估计多个质量变量对于构建工业软传感器模型至关重要，然而，这一直面临数据效率和负面传递问题。本文提出了一个平衡的专家混合模型（BMoE），它由多门专家混合模块（MMoE）和任务梯度平衡（TGB）模块组成。MoE模块旨在描述任务关系，而TGB模块动态平衡任务之间的梯度，两者共同解决了负面传递问题。在典型的硫回收装置上的实验表明，BMoE有效地建模了任务关系和平衡了训练过程，并且明显优于基准模型。",
