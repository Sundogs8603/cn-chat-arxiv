    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）和机器学习（ML）特别是由于其学习解决复杂问题的能力而被应用于各种应用程序中。过去十年中，机器学习的快速进展提出了由大量神经元和层组成的深度神经网络（DNN）。深度神经网络硬件加速器（DHA）用于将DNNs部署到目标应用程序中，同时在硬件故障/错误会导致灾难性后果的安全关键应用程序中也受益于DHA。因此，DNN的可靠性是研究的重要主题。近年来，已经发表了多项研究，以评估DNNs的可靠性。在这方面，已经提出了各种各样的可靠性评估方法，适用于各种平台和应用程序。因此，有必要总结现有技术以确定研究DNN的可靠性的研究中存在的差距。在这项工作中，我们进行了系统文献综述（SLR），以确定现有的DNN硬件可靠性评估方法。我们还回顾了现有的可用于DNN可靠性评估的数据集和基准。本研究的结果将帮助研究人员了解当前深度神经网络硬件可靠性评估方法的最新技术，同时也揭示了这一领域的遗漏空缺。",
