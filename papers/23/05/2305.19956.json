    "translated_abstract": "微型超声是一种新型的29MHz超声技术，提供比传统超声高3-4倍的分辨率，在诊断前列腺癌的准确性方面与MRI相当，但成本更低。然而，由于低分辨率和前列腺、膀胱和尿道中线之间的界限不清，基于微型超声的前列腺分割具有挑战性。本文提出了MicroSegNet，这是一个特别设计用于解决这些挑战的多尺度注释引导的Transformer UNet模型。在训练过程中，MicroSegNet更加关注难以分割（难区域）的区域，这些区域具有专家和非专家注释之间的差异。为此，我们提出了注释引导的二分类交叉熵（AG-BCE）损失，它在难区域中给预测误差分配更大的权重和较低的权重。",
