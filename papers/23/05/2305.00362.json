    "translated_abstract": "电力价格预测在能量储存系统（ESS）管理中起着至关重要的作用。目前的预测模型主要关注减少预测误差，但忽略了它们对下游决策的影响。因此，本文提出了一种以决策为中心的电力价格预测方法，用于ESS套利，以弥合下游优化模型和预测模型之间的差距。该决策焦点方法旨在利用下游套利模型来训练预测模型。它通过遗憾度量预测价值下的实际决策和在实际价值下的最优决策之间的差异（即决策误差），将其转化为可处理的代理遗憾，并据此推导出预测模型的渐变。基于预测误差和决策误差，本文提出了混合损失和相应的随机梯度下降学习方法，以学习预测模型来提高预测和决策的准确性。",
