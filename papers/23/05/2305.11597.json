Predictable behaviours and explainable (and understandable) rationale allow humans collaborating with (and building) these agents to understand their motivations and therefore validate decisions that are made. To that aim, we make use of G\\\"ardenfors's cognitively inspired Conceptual Space framework to represent the agent's knowledge using concepts as convex regions in a space spanned by inherently comprehensible quality dimensions. A simple typicality quantification model is built on top of it to determine fuzzy category membership and classify instances interpretably. We apply it on a use case from the manufacturing domain, using objects' physical properties obtained from cobots' onboard sensors and utilisation properties from crowdsourced commonsense knowledge available at public knowledge bases.
