    "abstract": "We present a novel approach for explaining Gaussian processes (GPs) that can utilize the full analytical covariance structure present in GPs. Our method is based on the popular solution concept of Shapley values extended to stochastic cooperative games, resulting in explanations that are random variables. The GP explanations generated using our approach satisfy similar favorable axioms to standard Shapley values and possess a tractable covariance function across features and data observations. This covariance allows for quantifying explanation uncertainties and studying the statistical dependencies between explanations. We further extend our framework to the problem of predictive explanation, and propose a Shapley prior over the explanation function to predict Shapley values for new data based on previously computed ones. Our extensive illustrations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的方法，用于解释可以利用高斯过程(GP)中完整分析协方差结构的方法。我们的方法基于广受欢迎的 Shapley 值解决方案概念，扩展为随机合作游戏，从而产生随机变量的解释。使用我们方法产生的 GP 解释满足与标准 Shapley 值类似的有利公理，并且具有跨特征和数据观察值的可处理协方差函数。这种协方差函数可以量化解释的不确定性，并研究解释之间的统计依赖关系。我们进一步将我们的框架扩展到预测解释问题，并提出一个 Shapley 先验概率，用于预测基于先前计算的 Shapley 值的新数据的 Shapley 值。我们广泛的说明了所提出方法的有效性。",
