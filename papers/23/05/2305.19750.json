    "abstract": "In this work, we studied the synthesis of Swiss German speech using different Text-to-Speech (TTS) models. We evaluated the TTS models on three corpora, and we found, that VITS models performed best, hence, using them for further testing. We also introduce a new method to evaluate TTS models by letting the discriminator of a trained vocoder GAN model predict whether a given waveform is human or synthesized. In summary, our best model delivers speech synthesis for different Swiss German dialects with previously unachieved quality.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在使用不同的文本到语音（TTS）模型合成瑞士德语语音。我们对三个语料库的TTS模型进行了评估，发现VITS模型表现最佳，因此将其用于进一步测试。我们还介绍了一种新的方法，通过让训练好的vocoder GAN模型的鉴别器预测给定波形是人类生成的还是合成的来评估TTS模型。总之，我们的最佳模型能够以前所未有的质量为不同的瑞士德语方言提供语音合成。",
