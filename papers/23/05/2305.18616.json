    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT于2022年11月推出后，受到全球学生和教育工作者的广泛关注，华《2023》的一份在线报告称其是历史上增长最快的消费应用程序。虽然在高等教育中讨论使用ChatGPT的话题很多，但其对跨学科合作学习的影响的实证研究很少。为了探究其潜力，我们进行了一项拟实验性研究，招募了130名本科生（STEM和非STEM），他们在两周内学习数字素养，有些使用ChatGPT，有些不使用。我们进行了有关跨学科问题解决、身体和认知投入以及对Chat GPT使用的个人反思的周度调查。对调查结果的分析显示，话题对跨学科问题解决和身体、认知投入有显著的主效应，学科背景和ChatGPT条件对认知投入有较小的交互效应， ChatGPT对STEM学生具有积极作用。",
