    "translated_abstract": "Yang等人发现，仅删除1%的训练数据就可能导致预测结果翻转。鉴于机器学习模型中存在噪声数据的普遍性，本文提出了一个问题：在模型训练之前通过重新标记一个小的训练数据子集可否导致测试结果翻转？本文利用扩展影响函数提出了一种有效的识别和重新标记这种子集的方法，并证明了其始终能够产生成功的结果。这种机制有多重作用：（1）提供了一种补充方法，可以通过恢复可能错误标记的训练数据来挑战模型预测；（2）评估模型的鲁棒性，因为本文发现子集的大小与训练集中噪声数据的比例之间存在显著关系；（3）提供了洞察训练集偏差的见解。据我们所知，这项工作代表了对识别最小训练子集问题的第一次研究。",
