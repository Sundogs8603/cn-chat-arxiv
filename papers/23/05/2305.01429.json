    "translated_abstract": "时间序列外源回归（TSER）涉及使用一组训练时间序列来形成一个连续响应变量的预测模型，该变量与回归器序列没有直接关系。TSER存档用于比较算法于2022年发布，包括19个问题。我们将此存档的大小增加到63个问题，并重现以前算法的基准比较。然后，我们扩展比较，包括更广泛的标准回归器和以前研究中使用的最新版本的TSER模型。我们表明，以前评估的回归器都不能胜过标准分类器旋转森林的回归适应。我们引入了两个新的TSER算法，这些算法是从时间序列分类的相关工作中开发而来。FreshPRINCE是一个管道估计器，包括转换到各种汇总特征，然后是一个旋转森林回归器。DrCIF是一个树集合，它根据时间序列的随机增量创建汇总统计信息特征，然后使用多个条件推理树来预测响应变量。在扩展的TSER问题集上，FreshPRINCE和DrCIF都始终优于基准算法。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了两种新的TSER算法：FreshPRINCE和DrCIF，它们分别由一组汇总特征和多个条件推理树构成，能够更好地在时间序列外源回归的问题上预测响应变量，比起以前的评估中使用的基线算法表现更佳。",
