    "translated_abstract": "近两年来，对于表格文本文档（例如财务报告）的离散推理越来越受到关注。现有的工作大多通过手动选择和转换文档页面到结构化的表格和段落来简化这一挑战，从而阻碍其实际应用。在这项工作中，我们探究了一种更为现实的问题设置，即以 TAT-DQA 的形式回答富含视觉表格文本的问题。具体而言，我们提出了一种新颖的 Doc2SoarGraph 框架，通过利用语义导向分层图结构中不同元素之间的差异和相关性，提高了其离散推理能力。我们对 TAT-DQA 数据集进行了广泛的实验，结果显示，我们的提出的框架在测试集上的精确匹配（EM）和 F1 得分方面分别比最佳基线模型分别提高了 17.73% 和 16.91%，实现了新的最先进技术水平。",
