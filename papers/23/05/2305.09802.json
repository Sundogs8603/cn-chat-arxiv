    "translated_abstract": "智能家居的使用者与设备的交互都有明确或隐含的目标。现有的家庭助手能够轻松地实现明确的目标，例如\"打开灯\"。然而，在更自然的交流中，人们往往会描述隐含的目标。例如，我们可以让别人\"让房间变得舒适\"而不是描述具体的步骤。当前的系统很难解决这种歧义，因为需要将模糊的意图与具体的设备联系起来。我们从通用大型语言模型（LLMs）的角度来解决这个问题，这些模型经过大量语料库的训练，并通过灵活的方式适应下游任务。我们探讨了使用LLMs控制设备并创建自动化程序以满足用户命令的隐含目标。在以用户为中心的研究中，我们发现LLMs可以创造性地推理，以实现挑战性的目标，同时也揭示了降低其有用性的差距。我们使用Sasha解决了这些差距：这是一个在智能家居中使用LLMs进行灵活解释用户命令和设备控制的创意目标导向推理系统。",

The study finds that this approach can creatively reason to achieve challenging goals, but also reveals gaps that diminish usefulness, which are addressed with the development of Sasha: a system for creative, goal-oriented reasoning in smart homes."
