    "translated_abstract": "营养不良是老年人中普遍存在的严重健康问题，尤其是在住院或机构化的个体中更加普遍。准确和早期的风险检测对于营养不良的管理和预防至关重要。配备人工智能（AI）的m-health服务可以在更自动化，客观和持续的监测和评估方面带来重要的改进。此外，最新的可解释人工智能（XAI）方法可以使AI决策可解释和可信任。本文提出了一个基于异构m-health数据的早期和可解释的营养不良风险检测的新型AI框架。我们执行了广泛的模型评估，包括独立个体和个性化预测，并且获得的结果表明，随机森林（RF）和梯度上升是表现最好的分类器，尤其是在纳入身体组成评估数据时。我们还调查了几种基准XAI方法。",
