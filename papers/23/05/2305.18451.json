    "translated_abstract": "最近，分子关系学习引起了分子科学领域的广泛关注，其目标是预测分子对之间的相互作用行为。本文提出了一种鲁棒性强的分子关系学习模型CMRL，它通过检测与化学反应因果相关的核心亚结构来应对分子关系学习中的数据分布变化。为此，我们首先假定基于分子科学领域知识的因果关系，并构建结构因果模型（SCM）来揭示变量之间的关系。基于SCM，我们引入了一个新的条件干预框架，其干预是基于成对分子条件的。使用条件干预框架，我们的模型成功地从因果亚结构中学习，并减轻了与化学反应虚假相关的快捷亚结构的混淆效应。本文在各种任务和真实和合成数据集上进行了广泛实验。",
