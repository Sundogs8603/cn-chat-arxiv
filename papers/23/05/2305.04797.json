    "translated_abstract": "信念传播是一种有用的概率推理算法，用于高效计算随机变量的近似边缘概率密度。然而，在标准形式下，信念传播只适用于具有固定和已知的向量元素数量的向量型随机变量，而某些应用依赖于具有未知向量元素数量的RFSs。在本文中，我们开发了适用于RFSs序列定义的因子图的信念传播规则，其中每个RFS具有未知的元素数量，旨在导出RFSs的新型推理方法。此外，我们证明了向量型信念传播是集合型信念传播的特例，其中每个RFS遵循伯努利过程。为了证明开发的集合型信念传播的有效性，我们将其应用于SLAM的PMB滤波器，从而自然地导致新的集合型BP映射、SLAM、多目标跟踪和同时定位与跟踪滤波器。最后，我们探讨了向量型信念传播和主题的关系。",
