    "translated_abstract": "Bandit问题在交互式学习方案和现代推荐系统中起着至关重要的作用。然而，这些系统通常依赖于敏感的用户数据，因此隐私是一个重要问题。本文通过交互式差分隐私的视角研究了基于可信集中式决策者的Bandit问题的隐私性。虽然已经对纯ε-全局差分隐私的Bandit问题进行了广泛研究，但我们在理解零集中差分隐私(zCDP)的Bandit问题方面做出了贡献。针对有限臂和线性Bandit问题，我们提供了关于遗憾的最小最大和问题相关下界，从而量化了这些情况下ρ-全局zCDP的代价。这些下界揭示了基于隐私预算ρ的两个困难区域，并表明ρ-全局zCDP比纯ε-全局差分隐私产生的遗憾更小。我们提出了两种有限臂和线性Bandit问题的ρ-全局zCDP算法，即AdaC-UCB和AdaC-GOPE。这两个算法都使用了高斯机制的共同策略。",

By providing lower bounds on regret for finite-armed and linear bandits, we reveal different hardness regimes for different privacy budgets and show that zCDP can provide better privacy protection than global differential privacy. We propose two algorithms to implement zCDP in bandit settings."
