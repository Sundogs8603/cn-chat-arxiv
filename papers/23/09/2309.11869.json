    "translated_abstract": "虽然语言是一个复杂的自适应系统，但大部分关于句法变异的研究都是独立地观察几个单个的结构，而忽视了整个语法的连接网络。本文通过系统地模拟英语使用者16个国家的49个当地群体的方言变异，量化了这种简化的影响。我们通过对整个语法以及语法内部的独立节点进行方言分类，以描述这些方言之间的句法差异。结果表明，首先，语法内的许多独立节点都受到变异的影响，但独立地来看，没有一个节点的表现能够与整个语法相比。这表明句法变异的一个重要部分是语法不同部分之间的相互作用。其次，结果表明相似的语言之间的语法差异和区别不只是个别节点的差异，而是整个语法结构的差异。",
