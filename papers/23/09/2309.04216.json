    "abstract": "To assign a value to a portfolio, it is common to use Mark-to-Market prices. But how to proceed when the securities are illiquid? When transaction prices are scarce, how to use other available real-time information? In this article dedicated to corporate bonds, we address these questions using an extension of the concept of micro-price recently introduced for assets exchanged on limit order books in the market microstructure literature and ideas coming from the recent literature on OTC market making. To account for liquidity imbalances in OTC markets, we use a novel approach based on Markov-modulated Poisson processes. Beyond an extension to corporate bonds of the concept of micro-price, we coin the new concept of Fair Transfer Price that can be used to value or transfer securities in a fair manner even when the market is illiquid and/or tends to be one-sided.",

    "translated_abstract": "在为投资组合分配价值时，通常使用现时价格。然而，当证券不够流动时应如何处理？当交易价格稀缺时，如何利用其他可用的实时信息？在本专注于公司债券的文章中，我们使用了最近在市场微观结构文献中引入的微观价格概念的拓展，并参考了最近有关场外市场做市的文献中的思想，来回答这些问题。为了解决场外市场中的流动性不平衡问题，我们采用了一种基于Markov调制泊松过程的新方法。除了将微观价格概念推广到公司债券领域之外，我们提出了公平转让价格的新概念，该概念可以用于在市场不够流动和/或趋向于单边的情况下公正地评估或转让证券。",
