    "translated_abstract": "准确建模人体器官在构建虚拟成像试验的计算仿真中起着至关重要的作用。然而，从计算机断层扫描中生成解剖学上可信的器官表面重建仍然对人体结构中的许多器官来说是个挑战。在处理大肠时，这个挑战尤为明显。在这项研究中，我们利用几何深度学习和去噪扩散概率模型的最新进展来优化大肠分割结果。首先，我们将器官表示为从3D分割掩模表面采样得到的点云。随后，我们使用分层变分自编码器获得器官形状的全局和局部潜在表示。我们在分层潜在空间中训练两个条件去噪扩散模型来进行形状精化。为了进一步提高我们的方法，我们还结合了一种先进的表面重构模型，从而实现形状的更好恢复。",
