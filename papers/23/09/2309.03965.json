    "abstract": "This paper presents our proposed approach that won the first prize at the ICLR competition on Hardware Aware Efficient Training. The challenge is to achieve the highest possible accuracy in an image classification task in less than 10 minutes. The training is done on a small dataset of 5000 images picked randomly from CIFAR-10 dataset. The evaluation is performed by the competition organizers on a secret dataset with 1000 images of the same size. Our approach includes applying a series of technique for improving the generalization of ResNet-9 including: sharpness aware optimization, label smoothing, gradient centralization, input patch whitening as well as metalearning based training. Our experiments show that the ResNet-9 can achieve the accuracy of 88% while trained only on a 10% subset of CIFAR-10 dataset in less than 10 minuets",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了我们提出的方法，该方法在ICLR硬件感知高效训练竞赛中获得了第一名。挑战是在不到10分钟的时间内，在一个小数据集上实现尽可能高的图像分类准确率。训练使用的小数据集是从CIFAR-10数据集中随机挑选的5000幅图像。评估由竞赛组织者在一个包含1000幅相同大小图像的秘密数据集上进行。我们的方法包括应用一系列技术来提高ResNet-9的泛化性能，包括：锐度感知优化、标签平滑、梯度居中化、输入图像补丁白化以及基于元学习的训练。我们的实验结果表明，在不到10分钟的时间内，ResNet-9可以在仅训练CIFAR-10数据集的10%子集上达到88%的准确率。",
