    "abstract": "Remittances have become one of the driving forces of development for countries all over the world, especially in lower-middle-income nations. This paper empirically investigates the association between remittance flows and financial development in 4 lower-middle-income countries of Latin America. By using a panel data set from 1996 to 2019, the study revealed that remittances and financial development are positively associated in these countries. The study also discovered that foreign direct investment and inflation were positively correlated with financial development while trade openness had a negative association with financial development. Therefore, policymakers of these countries should implement and formulate such policies so that migrant workers would have the incentives to send money through formal channels, which will augment the effect of remittances on the recipient country.",

    "translated_abstract": "汇款已成为世界各国特别是中低收入国家发展的推动力之一。本文实证研究了拉丁美洲四个中低收入国家汇款流动与金融发展之间的关系。通过使用1996年至2019年的面板数据集，研究发现这些国家的汇款和金融发展呈正相关。研究还发现外国直接投资和通货膨胀与金融发展呈正相关，而贸易开放与金融发展呈负相关。因此，这些国家的决策者应制定相应政策，使移民工人有动力通过正规渠道发送资金，从而增加汇款对接收国家的影响。",
