    "translated_abstract": "从MRI中预测大脑年龄已成为与多种神经病理学相关的流行成像生物标志物。然而，用于训练的数据集往往在人口统计上偏斜和不平衡，这可能使大脑年龄预测模型容易受到偏见的影响。我们通过进行全面的亚组性能分析和特征检查来分析常用的ResNet-34模型。该模型在来自Cam-CAN和IXI的1,215个T1加权MRI扫描上进行训练，并在UK Biobank（n=42,786）上进行测试，分为六个种族和生物性别亚组。为了比较亚组之间的性能，通过绝对预测误差来衡量，我们使用Kruskal-Wallis检验，后跟两个后续的Conover-Iman检验来检查种族和生物性别之间的偏见。为了检查生成的特征中的偏见，我们使用PCA进行维度约简，并使用两样本Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验来识别亚组之间的分布变化。",
