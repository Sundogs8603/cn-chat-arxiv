    "translated_abstract": "云服务无处不在，关键云服务的故障是不可避免的事实。为了保留客户并防止收入损失，提供高可靠性保证对于这些服务来说是非常重要的。预测服务中断是一种减轻严重程度和恢复时间的方法。由于这些事件的罕见性，预测关键性故障是困难的。此外，关键故障在可观测数据方面定义模糊。我们提出的方法Outage-Watch将关键的服务中断定义为一组指标所捕获的服务质量（QoS）的恶化情况。Outage-Watch通过使用当前系统状态来预测QoS指标是否会超过阈值并引发极端事件，提前检测此类中断。使用高斯混合模型来模拟QoS指标的分布以提高灵活性，而极端事件正则化有助于提高尾部分布的学习能力。",
