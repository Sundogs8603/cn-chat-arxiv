    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑使用步态加速度数据来预测个体的身份。之前的研究中，我们提出了一种方法，将加速度时间序列转化为图像，通过构建完整的经验自相关分布来实现。通过将该图像分成网格单元，并使用逻辑回归产生的预测器，可以进行个体身份的预测。在本文中，我们：(1) 实施了使用基于网格单元的预测器进行预测的机器学习方法；(2) 推导了一种推断方法，以筛选出最具预测性的网格单元；(3) 发展了一种新颖的多元函数回归模型，避免了将预测器空间分成单元格。针对两个开源数据集进行了预测方法比较：(1)来自32个个体在1.06千米路径上行走的加速度数据；(2)在两个不同场合进行了六次重复行走的20米路径上收集的加速度数据，时间间隔至少为一周。",
