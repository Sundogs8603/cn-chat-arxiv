    "abstract": "Stock prices often react sluggishly to news, producing gradual jumps and jump delays. Econometricians typically treat these sluggish reactions as microstructure effects and settle for a coarse sampling grid to guard against them. Synchronizing mistimed stock returns on a fine sampling grid allows us to automatically detect noisy jumps and better approximate the true common jumps in related stock prices.",

    "translated_abstract": "股价对新闻的反应往往缓慢，产生渐进的跳动和延迟跳动。经济计量学家通常将这些缓慢的反应视为市场微观结构的影响，并采用粗糙的采样网格来规避这些影响。在一个精细的采样网格上同步误时的股票收益，可以自动探测到噪声跳动，并更好地逼近相关股票价格中真实的共同跳动。",
