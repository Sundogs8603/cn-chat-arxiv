    "translated_abstract": "近年来，关于生物神经网络（BNNs）中学习与人工神经网络中学习的区别一直存在激烈的争论。通常认为，大脑中连接的更新仅依赖于局部信息，因此不能使用随机梯度下降类型的优化方法。本文研究了BNNs中监督学习的随机模型。我们展示了当每个学习机会通过许多局部更新进行处理时，（连续的）梯度步骤近似发生。这一结果表明，随机梯度下降可能在优化BNNs中起到一定作用。",

This suggests a potential role of stochastic gradient descent in optimizing biological neural networks."
