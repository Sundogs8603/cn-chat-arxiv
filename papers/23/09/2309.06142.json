    "translated_abstract": "现实世界中存在着普遍的分布偏移。然而，深度神经网络(DNN)很容易对训练集产生偏见，这在接收到超出分布的数据时会导致性能严重下降。在领域泛化(DG)的文献中，研究了许多方法以训练在不同分布偏移下具有广泛泛化能力的模型。然而，最近的DomainBed和WILDS基准挑战了这些方法的有效性。针对现有研究中存在的问题，我们提出了一个新的领域泛化任务，用于丰富DG方法研究的应用场景，即手写中文字符识别(HCCR)。我们在提出的PaHCC（印刷和手写中文字符）数据集上评估了18种DG方法，并显示现有方法在该数据集上的性能仍然不令人满意。此外，在设计的动态DG设置下，我们揭示了DG方法的更多属性，并认为只有留出一个领域的方法可以在这种设置下实现良好的性能。",
