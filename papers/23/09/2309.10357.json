    "abstract": "Recommender systems usually leverage multi-task learning methods to simultaneously optimize several objectives because of the multi-faceted user behavior data. The typical way of conducting multi-task learning is to establish appropriate parameter sharing across multiple tasks at lower layers while reserving a separate task tower for each task at upper layers. Since the task towers exert direct impact on the prediction results, we argue that the architecture of standalone task towers is sub-optimal for promoting positive knowledge sharing. Accordingly, we propose the framework of Deep Mutual Learning across task towers, which is compatible with various backbone multi-task networks. Extensive offline experiments and online AB tests are conducted to evaluate and verify the proposed approach's effectiveness.",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统通常利用多任务学习方法来同时优化多个目标，因为用户行为数据是多方面的。典型的多任务学习方法是在较低层次上建立适当的参数共享，而在较高层次上为每个任务保留独立的任务塔。由于任务塔对预测结果产生直接影响，我们认为独立的任务塔结构对于促进正面知识共享是次优的。因此，我们提出了跨任务塔的深度互相学习框架，该框架与各种主干多任务网络兼容。通过大量的离线实验和在线AB测试来评估和验证所提出方法的有效性。",
