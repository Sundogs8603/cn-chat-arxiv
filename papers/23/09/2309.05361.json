    "translated_abstract": "未来托卡马克中高昂的数据获取成本和对破裂放电的巨大需求给数据驱动破裂预测模型在破裂预测研究中带来了内在矛盾。在本文中，我们展示了一种新颖的方法，使用只有少量放电来预测未来托卡马克的破裂。第一步是利用对各个托卡马克的诊断信号的现有物理理解来提取物理引导特征，称为物理引导特征提取（PGFE）。第二步是根据一种称为CORrelation ALignment（CORAL）的领域适应算法，将未来托卡马克（目标领域）的少量数据与现有托卡马克（源领域）的大量数据进行对齐。这是第一次尝试将领域适应应用于破裂预测任务中。PGFE已成功应用于J-TEXT以实现出色的破裂预测性能。由于提取了物理引导特征，PGFE还可以减少数据量要求。",
