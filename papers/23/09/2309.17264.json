    "translated_abstract": "医学图像分割旨在描绘感兴趣的解剖或病理结构，在临床诊断中起着关键作用。构建高精度的深度分割模型需要大量高质量的注释数据。然而，医学注释非常繁琐耗时，特别是对于医学视频或3D体积，由于巨大的标签空间和差的帧间一致性。最近，在自然图像中，一个名为Moving Object Segmentation (MOS)的基本任务在技术上取得了重大进展。它的目标是在图像序列中从背景中描绘移动物体，只需要最小的注释。在本文中，我们提出了第一个用于医学图像中MOS的基础模型，名为iMOS。对一个大规模多模态医学数据集进行的大量实验验证了所提出的iMOS的有效性。具体而言，只需对序列中少量的图像进行注释，iMOS就可以实现了",
