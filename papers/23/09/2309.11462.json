    "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition systems have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate the command executed on the device. Recent research has focused on exploring methods to create such attacks, however, some issues relating to Over-The-Air (OTA) attacks have not been properly addressed. In our work, we examine the needed properties of robust attacks compatible with the OTA model, and we design a method of generating attacks with arbitrary such desired properties, namely the invariance to synchronization, and the robustness to filtering: this allows a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack against ASR systems. We achieve these characteristics by constructing attacks in a modified frequency domain through an inverse Fourier transform. We evaluate our method on standard keyword classification tasks and analyze it in OTA, and we analyze the properties of the cross-domain attacks to explain the efficiency of the approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动语音识别系统已经被证明容易受到对设备上命令的恶意攻击。最近的研究主要探讨如何创建这种攻击，然而一些与空中接口 (OTA) 攻击相关的问题尚未得到妥善解决。在我们的工作中，我们研究了与OTA模型兼容的强攻击所需的属性，并设计了一种可以生成具有任意所需属性的攻击的方法，即对同步的不变性和对滤波的鲁棒性：这允许对ASR系统进行拒绝服务（DoS）攻击。我们通过构建一个改进的频域攻击，并通过逆傅里叶变换实现了这些特性。我们在标准的关键词分类任务上评估了我们的方法，并在OTA环境中进行了分析，并分析了跨领域攻击的属性，以解释该方法的高效性。",
