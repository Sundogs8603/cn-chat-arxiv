    "translated_abstract": "我们展示了一项关于预测大脑对真实图像反应的机器学习架构的研究，以应对Algonauts Challenge 2023。我们的研究涉及对各种预训练模型进行了广泛实验。最初，我们采用了较简单的模型来预测大脑活动，但逐渐引入了更复杂的架构，利用可用的数据和大规模预训练模型生成的嵌入。我们遇到了与机器学习问题相关的典型困难，比如正则化和过拟合，以及与挑战特定的问题，如难以结合多个输入编码，以及输出的高维度、不明确的结构和嘈杂性。为了克服这些问题，我们测试了基于单边三维位置、多感兴趣区域(ROI)和半球的预测模型，但我们发现使用多个简单的模型，每个模型专注于受试者大脑每个半球的每个ROI，可以获得更好的结果。",
