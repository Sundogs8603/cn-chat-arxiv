Recent studies have highlighted the potential of using foundation models in geospatial artificial intelligence, known as GeoAI Foundation Models or Geo-Foundation Models, for geographic question answering, remote sensing image understanding, map generation, and location-based services, among others.

    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，我们在人工智能的基础模型中取得了实质性的进展，包括语言、视觉和多模态模型。最近的研究突出了在地理空间人工智能中使用基础模型的潜力，称为GeoAI基础模型或Geo-Foundation模型，用于地理问题回答、遥感图像理解、地图生成和基于位置的服务等。然而，GeoAI基础模型的开发和应用可能带来严重的隐私和安全风险，这些风险到目前为止尚未得到充分的讨论或解决。本文介绍了GeoAI基础模型在整个生命周期中的潜在隐私和安全风险，并提出了全面的预防和控制策略蓝图。通过这篇展望性论文，我们希望引起地理空间领域的研究人员和决策者对GeoAI基础模型中固有的隐私和安全风险的关注。",
