    "abstract": "The Harrisonburg Department of Public Transportation (HDPT) aims to leverage their data to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations. We construct two supply and demand models that help the department identify gaps in their service. The models take many variables into account, including the way that the HDPT reports to the federal government and the areas with the most vulnerable populations in Harrisonburg City. We employ data analysis and machine learning techniques to make our predictions.",
