    "translated_abstract": "如今的医疗决策支持人工智能系统在研究论文中取得了成功，但在实际部署中却面临失败的问题。本研究聚焦于脓毒症的决策过程，这是一种需要临床医生早期高度不确定性诊断的急性致命全身性感染。我们的目标是探索能够支持临床专家做出更好脓毒症早期诊断决策的人工智能系统的设计要求。研究从一个形成性研究开始，调查为什么临床专家在电子病历系统中放弃了一个现有的脓毒症预测模块。我们认为，一个以人为中心的人工智能系统需要在医疗决策过程的中间阶段（如生成假设或收集数据）支持人类专家，而不仅仅关注最终决策。因此，我们基于先进的人工智能算法构建了SepsisLab，并将其扩展到预测未来趋势。",
