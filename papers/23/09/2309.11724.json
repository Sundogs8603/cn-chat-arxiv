    "abstract": "Prosodic phrasing is crucial to the naturalness and intelligibility of end-to-end Text-to-Speech (TTS). There exist both linguistic and emotional prosody in natural speech. As the study of prosodic phrasing has been linguistically motivated, prosodic phrasing for expressive emotion rendering has not been well studied. In this paper, we propose an emotion-aware prosodic phrasing model, termed \\textit{EmoPP}, to mine the emotional cues of utterance accurately and predict appropriate phrase breaks. We first conduct objective observations on the ESD dataset to validate the strong correlation between emotion and prosodic phrasing. Then the objective and subjective evaluations show that the EmoPP outperforms all baselines and achieves remarkable performance in terms of emotion expressiveness. The audio samples and the code are available at \\url{https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/EmoPP}.",

    "translated_abstract": "韵律短语对于端到端的文本转语音(TTS)的自然性和可懂性至关重要。自然语音中存在着语言和情感的韵律。由于韵律短语研究一直以来以语言学为动力，因此表情化韵律短语化的研究还不够充分。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为“EmoPP”的情感感知韵律短语模型，准确地挖掘了话语中的情感线索，并预测了适当的短语断点。我们首先对ESD数据集进行客观观察，验证了情感和韵律短语之间的强相关性。然后，客观和主观评估表明，EmoPP优于所有基准线，并在情感表达方面取得了显著的性能。音频样本和代码可在\\url{https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/EmoPP}找到。",
