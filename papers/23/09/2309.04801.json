    "translated_abstract": "Tsetlin机器（TM）从基于算术的机器学习转变为基于逻辑的机器学习提供了一种根本性的改变。支持卷积，TM成功地处理像MNIST，Fashion-MNIST和CIFAR-2这样的图像分类数据集。然而，TM在表示更复杂任务的CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上难以达到最先进的性能。本文介绍了专用TM之间的即插即用协作，称为TM Composites。协作依赖于TM在学习过程中特化的能力和在推理过程中评估自身能力的能力。当团队组合时，最自信的TM做出决策，解决了不确定的问题。通过这种方式，TM组合比其成员更有能力，从他们的专业化中受益。协作的特点是即插即用，即成员可以在任何时间、任何方式下组合，无需微调。在我们的实证评估中，我们实现了三个TM专业化：梯度直方图，自适应高斯",
