    "translated_abstract": "本文针对具有数百万个标签的极端分类任务，发展了一种名为MUFIN的技术，其中数据点和标签具有视觉和文本描述符。将MUFIN应用于数百万个产品的产品推荐和竞标查询预测中。当代的多模态方法通常依赖于仅嵌入式方法。另一方面，XC方法利用分类器架构提供比仅嵌入式方法更高的准确性，但主要专注于基于文本的分类任务。MUFIN通过将多模态分类重新制定为具有数百万个标签的XC问题来弥合这一差距。这提出了两个挑战：开发能够提供足够表达力以实现对数百万个标签进行准确分类的多模态架构；以及在标签数量的对数尺度上扩展训练和推理例程。MUFIN基于交叉的方法开发了一种架构。",
