    "translated_abstract": "分子性质预测为药物候选物的早期筛选和优化提供了一种有效且高效的方法。尽管基于深度学习的方法取得了显著进展，但大多数现有方法仍未充分利用3D空间信息。这可能导致单个分子表示多个实际分子。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种名为3D-Mol的新颖的基于3D结构的分子建模方法。为了准确表示完整的空间结构，我们设计了一种新颖的编码器，通过将分子分解成三个几何图形来提取3D特征。此外，我们使用20M个无标签数据通过对比学习对模型进行预训练。我们将具有相同拓扑结构的构象视为正样本对，将相反的构象视为负样本对，而权重则由构象之间的差异确定。我们在7个基准数据集上将3D-Mol与各种最先进的基准模型进行了对比。",
