    "translated_abstract": "在当今快速发展的就业市场中，找到合适的机会可能是一项艰巨的挑战。随着人工智能领域的进步，计算机现在可以向候选人推荐适合的工作。然而，推荐工作的任务与向观众推荐电影并不相同。除了技能和经验等必备条件外，一个工作是否适合给定候选人还取决于许多微妙的方面。传统的方法可以捕捉到工作和候选人的可量化方面，但在将数据从非结构化形式（如工作描述和简历）转化为结构化形式的过程中，数据的很大一部分会丢失。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）以其在文本数据可用的领域表现出的卓越性能席卷了人工智能领域。受到LLMs出色表现的启发，我们利用它们理解自然语言的能力，以捕捉到先前在非结构化数据中丢失的信息。",
