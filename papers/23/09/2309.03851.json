    "translated_abstract": "生存分析是一种有价值的工具，可以基于基线观测来估计特定事件（如死亡或癌症复发）发生的时间。这在医疗保健中非常有用，可以根据患者数据预测临床重要事件的预后。然而，现有方法常常存在局限性；有些方法只关注将患者按生存能力进行排名，忽视了对实际事件时间的估计；而其他方法将问题视为分类任务，忽视了事件的时间顺序结构。此外，有效利用被审查样本（训练数据点，其中确切事件时间不可知）对于提高模型的预测准确性至关重要。在本文中，我们引入了CenTime，一种新的生存分析方法，直接估计事件发生的时间。我们的方法具有创新的事件条件审查机制，即使没有未被审查的数据，也能表现出良好的鲁棒性。我们证明了我们的方法在准确性上的优势。",
