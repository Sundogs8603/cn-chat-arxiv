    "abstract": "Electricity demand forecasting is a well established research field. Usually this task is performed considering historical loads, weather forecasts, calendar information and known major events. Recently attention has been given on the possible use of new sources of information from textual news in order to improve the performance of these predictions. This paper proposes a Long and Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network incorporating textual news features that successfully predicts the deterministic and probabilistic tasks of the UK national electricity demand. The study finds that public sentiment and word vector representations related to transport and geopolitics have time-continuity effects on electricity demand. The experimental results show that the LSTM with textual features improves by more than 3% compared to the pure LSTM benchmark and by close to 10% over the official benchmark. Furthermore, the proposed model effectively reduces forecasting uncertainty by narrowing the confidence",

    "translated_abstract": "电力需求预测是一个已经建立起来的研究领域。通常情况下，这项任务是通过考虑历史负荷、天气预报、日历信息和已知的重大事件来完成的。最近，人们开始关注如何利用来自文本新闻的新信息来提高这些预测的性能。本文提出了一种将文本新闻特征纳入其中的长短期记忆（LSTM）网络，成功预测了英国国家电力需求的确定性和概率任务。研究发现，公众情绪以及与交通和地缘政治相关的词向量表示对电力需求具有时间连续性的影响。实验结果表明，带有文本特征的LSTM相对于纯LSTM基准模型提高了超过3%，相对于官方基准模型提高了接近10%。此外，所提出的模型通过缩小置信区间有效地减少了预测不确定性。",
