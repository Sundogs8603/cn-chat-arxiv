    "translated_abstract": "由于其卓越的自然语言处理能力，大型AI语言模型近年来备受关注。它们在语言相关任务中具有重要贡献，包括基于提示的学习，因此对于各种特定任务非常有价值。这种方法释放了它们的全部潜力，提高了准确性和泛化性。研究界正在积极探索它们的应用，ChatGPT也因此获得了认可。尽管大型语言模型已经有了广泛的研究，但其在推荐场景中的潜力仍待探索。本研究旨在填补这一空白，通过探究ChatGPT作为零-shot推荐系统的能力。我们的目标包括评估其利用用户偏好进行推荐、重新排序现有推荐列表、利用相似用户的信息以及处理冷启动情况的能力。我们通过对三个数据集（MovieLens Small、Last.FM和Facebook Bo）进行全面实验来评估ChatGPT的性能。",
