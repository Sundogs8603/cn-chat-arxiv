    "translated_abstract": "运动预测对于自动驾驶汽车在复杂交通环境中安全运行至关重要。提取交通元素之间的有效时空关系是准确预测的关键。本文受到预训练大型语言模型成功应用的启发，提出了SEPT，这是一个利用自监督学习来开发复杂交通场景中强大的时空理解能力的建模框架。具体而言，我们的方法涉及到在场景输入上进行三个掩码重构建模任务，包括代理路径和道路网络，预训练场景编码器以捕捉轨迹的运动学特征，道路网络的空间结构以及道路和代理之间的交互作用。预训练的编码器然后在下游预测任务上进行微调。大量实验证明，SEPT在Argoverse 1和Argoverse上无需精心设计的架构或手动特征工程，达到了最先进的性能水平。",
