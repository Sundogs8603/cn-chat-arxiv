    "translated_abstract": "基于图像的膳食评估是使用进食场合图像作为输入的高效准确的记录和分析营养摄入的解决方案。基于深度学习的技术通常用于进行食物分类、分割和份量估计等图像分析任务，这些任务依赖于大量带有注释的食物图像进行训练。然而，这种数据依赖性对于真实世界应用来说存在重大障碍，因为获取大量丰富多样且平衡的食物图像集可能具有挑战性。一种潜在的解决方案是使用合成的食物图像进行数据增强。尽管现有的研究已经探索了基于生成对抗网络（GAN）的结构进行生成，但合成食物图像的质量仍然不理想。此外，尽管扩散式生成模型已经在一般图像生成任务中显示出了良好的结果，但生成食物图像可能具有挑战性，因为要生成真实的食物外观和细节是困难的。",

Existing methods use generative adversarial network structures for synthesis, but the quality of synthetic images is still unsatisfying. This research explores the use of clustering to improve image quality and provides a novel approach to food image generation."
