    "translated_abstract": "许多人可能在生活中面临法律纠纷，但他们对如何应对这些复杂问题的理解不足，往往使他们处于弱势地位。自然语言处理的进步为通过开发自动化法律援助系统弥合这种法律识字差距提供了新的途径。然而，现有的法律问题回答（LQA）方法往往受限于范围狭窄，要么局限于特定的法律领域，要么只提供简短无信息量的回答。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种端到端的方法，旨在生成任何法定法律问题的长篇回答，采用“先检索后阅读”的流程。为了支持这种方法，我们引入并发布了长篇法律问题回答（LLeQA）数据集，其中包含1,868个由专家标注的法律问题（使用法语），并提供了根据相关法律条文提供详细答案。我们的实验结果显示了有希望的性能。",
