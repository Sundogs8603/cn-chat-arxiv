    "translated_abstract": "多年来，神经科学在文本模态下积累了大量的研究成果，可以用于探索认知过程。元分析是一种典型的方法，成功地利用这些研究结果从文本查询到脑部激活图之间建立联系，但它仍然依赖于理想的查询环境。在实际应用中，用于元分析的文本查询可能会遇到语义冗余和歧义等问题，导致对脑图的映射不准确。另一方面，像ChatGPT这样的大型语言模型(LLMs)在上下文理解和推理等任务中展现出巨大潜力，与人类自然语言具有高度一致性。因此，LLMs可以改进文本模态与神经科学之间的联系，解决元分析存在的挑战。在本研究中，我们提出了一种称为Chat2Brain的方法，将LLMs与基本的文本-图像模型Text2Brain相结合，以映射开放式语义查询到脑部激活图。",
