    "abstract": "Instructional texts for specific target groups should ideally take into account the prior knowledge and needs of the readers in order to guide them efficiently to their desired goals. However, targeting specific groups also carries the risk of reflecting disparate social norms and subtle stereotypes. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which how-to guides from one particular platform, wikiHow, differ in practice depending on the intended audience. We conduct two case studies in which we examine qualitative features of texts written for specific audiences. In a generalization study, we investigate which differences can also be systematically demonstrated using computational methods. The results of our studies show that guides from wikiHow, like other text genres, are subject to subtle biases. We aim to raise awareness of these inequalities as a first step to addressing them in future work.",

    "translated_abstract": "面向特定目标群体的指导性文本应该根据读者的先前知识和需求来有效地引导他们实现其期望的目标。然而，针对特定群体也会存在反映不同社会规范和微妙刻板印象的风险。在本文中，我们调查了来自wikiHow平台的特定受众的如何指南在实践中的差异程度。我们进行了两个案例研究，研究了针对特定受众撰写的文本的定性特点。在一个概括性研究中，我们调查了哪些差异也可以通过计算方法系统地展示出来。我们的研究结果显示，来自wikiHow的指南，像其他文本流派一样，也受到微妙偏见的影响。我们的目标是提高对这些不平等问题的意识，作为解决这些问题的第一步。",
