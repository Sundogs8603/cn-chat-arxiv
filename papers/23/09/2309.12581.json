    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种能够处理未经训练的采样频率（SF）的通用声音分离（USS）方法。USS旨在分离不同类型的任意源，并且可以作为任何下游任务的预处理器而被普遍使用的关键技术。为了实现通用的源分离器，有两个必要属性：对源类型和录制条件的通用性。前者的属性已经在USS文献中研究过，大大增加了单个神经网络可以处理的源类型数量。然而，后者的属性（例如，SF）尽管其必要性，但却受到了较少的关注。由于SF根据下游任务的不同而有很大差异，通用的源分离器必须能处理各种 SF。在本文中，为了涵盖这两个属性，我们提出了一个对计算效率较高的USS网络SuDoRM-RF的SF无关（SFI）扩展。",
