    "translated_abstract": "全球环境变化正推动许多社会环境系统朝着临界阈值迈进，在这些阈值上，生态系统状态处于临界转折点, 需要干预来引导或避免即将发生的转变。闪烁是指系统在不同稳定状态之间摇摆的现象，被认为是对向不可取的生态制度进行无法逆转的转变的有用预警信号。然而，尽管闪烁可能预示一个生态转折点，这些动态也给人类的适应带来了独特的挑战。在这项工作中，我们将能够闪烁的生态模型与一个模拟人类对变化环境适应的模型联系起来。这使得我们能够探索闪烁对联合社会环境系统中自适应主体的效用的影响。我们重点研究了闪烁导致福祉不成比例下降的条件，并探讨了这些动态对转型变化的最佳时机的影响。",
    "tldr": "本研究将能够闪烁的生态模型与人类适应模型相结合，从而探索闪烁对联合社会环境系统中人类福祉的影响，并重点研究了闪烁导致福祉下降的条件以及对转型变化的最佳时机的影响。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study combines an ecological model that exhibits flickering with a model of human adaptation to explore the impact of flickering on human well-being in a coupled socio-environmental system. It focuses on the conditions under which flickering causes a decline in well-being and how these dynamics affect the optimal timing of a transformational change."
