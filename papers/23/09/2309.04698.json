    "abstract": "In this study, we present a feedforward control system designed for active gravity compensation on an upper body exoskeleton. The system utilizes only positional data from internal motor sensors to calculate torque, employing analytical control equations based on Newton-Euler Inverse Dynamics. Compared to feedback control systems, the feedforward approach offers several advantages. It eliminates the need for external torque sensors, resulting in reduced hardware complexity and weight. Moreover, the feedforward control exhibits a more proactive response, leading to enhanced performance. The exoskeleton used in the experiments is lightweight and comprises 4 Degrees of Freedom, closely mimicking human upper body kinematics and three-dimensional range of motion. We conducted tests on both hardware and simulations of the exoskeleton, demonstrating stable performance. The system maintained its position over an extended period, exhibiting minimal friction and avoiding undesired slewing.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们提出了一种设计用于上肢外骨骼的主动重力补偿的前馈控制系统。该系统仅利用来自内部电机传感器的位置数据来计算力矩，采用基于牛顿-欧拉反向动力学的分析控制方程。与反馈控制系统相比，前馈方法具有几个优势。它消除了对外部力矩传感器的需求，从而减少了硬件复杂性和重量。此外，前馈控制具有更积极的响应，提高性能。实验中使用的外骨骼轻巧，由4个自由度组成，密切模拟了人体上肢运动学和三维活动范围。我们对外骨骼进行了硬件和模拟测试，证明了其稳定性能。系统在延长的时间内保持位置稳定，表现出最少的摩擦和避免不希望的偏转。",
