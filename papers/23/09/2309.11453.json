    "translated_abstract": "在各种任务中，基于学习的控制器表现出比经典控制器更好的性能。然而，提供安全保证并不容易。安全，即满足状态和输入约束，可以通过将学习到的控制策略与安全滤波器相结合来保证。模型预测安全滤波器（MPSFs）是一种基于模型预测控制（MPC）的常见安全滤波方法。MPSFs旨在在立即的下一个时间步骤中保证安全，同时最小化提出的输入与应用的输入之间的差异。这种有限的预见性可能导致在约束边界附近出现颤动运动和不希望的振荡，即所谓的震荡现象。在本文中，我们通过考虑更长的前瞻性输入修正来减少震荡。在有界模型不确定性的假设下，我们使用鲁棒MPC的技术证明了递归可行性。我们在广泛的仿真和四旋翼实验中验证了所提出的方法。",
