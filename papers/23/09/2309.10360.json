    "translated_abstract": "多目标行人跟踪在遮挡的情况下面临着挑战。现有方法在遮挡情况下由于不准确的运动估计、外观特征提取和关联而受到影响，导致身份F1得分（IDF1）不够准确，ID切换过多（IDSw），以及关联准确性和召回率（AssA和AssR）不足。我们发现主要原因是部分遮挡引起的异常检测。本文认为明确的运动估计、可靠的外观特征和公平的关联是解决遮挡场景下问题的关键。具体而言，我们提出了一种自适应遮挡感知多目标行人跟踪器OccluTrack。首先，我们将异常运动抑制机制引入到卡尔曼滤波器中，以自适应地检测和抑制部分遮挡引起的异常运动。其次，我们提出了一种姿势导向的再识别模块，用于提取部分遮挡行人的判别性部分特征。最后，我们设计了一个全局相关性优化方法，以提高遮挡场景下的关联准确性。",
