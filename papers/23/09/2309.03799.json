    "translated_abstract": "在世界上许多地方，对公共道路上收集的大量数据用于自动驾驶的使用已经增加。为了在实际道路驾驶场景中检测和匿名化行人面部和附近的车牌，迫切需要有效的解决方案。随着收集的数据越来越多，涉及隐私的担忧也在增加，包括但不限于行人面部和周围车辆牌照。普通相机和鱼眼相机是通常安装在采集车辆上的两种常见相机类型。由于复杂的相机失真模型，与普通图像相比，鱼眼相机图像发生了变形。这导致在使用多个深度学习模型时，计算机视觉任务表现不佳。在这项工作中，我们特别关注对无人驾驶车辆拍摄的鱼眼相机照片进行隐私保护，同时遵守几项法律要求。首先，我们提出了一个框架，用于从几种不同的深度学习模型中提取人脸和车牌识别知识。",
