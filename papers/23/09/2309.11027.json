    "translated_abstract": "命名实体识别(NER)旨在从文本中提取和分类实体提及，并将其归类为预定义的类型(例如，组织或个人名称)。最近，许多工作将NER塑造为机器阅读理解问题(也称为基于MRC的NER)，其中通过MRC回答与预定义实体类型相关的问题来实现实体识别，基于上下文。然而，这些工作忽视了实体类型之间的标签依赖关系，这对于准确识别命名实体至关重要。在本文中，我们提出将实体类型之间的标签依赖关系纳入到多任务学习框架中，以更好地实现基于MRC的NER。我们将基于MRC的NER分解为多个任务，并使用自注意力模块来捕获标签依赖关系。通过在嵌套NER和扁平NER数据集上进行全面实验，验证了所提出的多任务NER的有效性。实验结果表明，多任务NER能够达到更好的效果。",
