    "translated_abstract": "越来越多从患者那里收集到的大型临床数据集的可用性，使得使用不同的分析算法对复杂疾病进行计算化特征化成为可能。一种从大型临床数据集中提取知识的有前途的新方法是将时间模式挖掘与机器学习工作流程相结合。然而，挖掘这些时间模式是一项计算密集型任务，并且会对存储器产生影响。目前的算法，如时间序列模式挖掘（tSPM）算法，已经提供了有希望的结果，但仍有优化的空间。在本文中，我们提出了tSPM+算法，这是tSPM算法的一种高性能实现，通过在时间模式中添加持续时间维度，增加了一种新的维度。我们展示了tSPM+算法提供了高达980倍的加速和高达48倍的内存使用改进。此外，我们提供了一个包含R包的docker容器，我们还提供了完整的实验代码。",
