    "abstract": "In the year 2022, a total of 466 patients from various cities across Iraq were included in this study. This research paper focuses on the application of machine learning techniques to analyse and predict multi-organ dysfunction in individuals experiencing Post-COVID-19 Syndrome, commonly known as Long COVID. Post-COVID-19 Syndrome presents a wide array of persistent symptoms affecting various organ systems, posing a significant challenge to healthcare. Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, this study aims to enhance early detection and management of this complex condition. The paper outlines the importance of data collection and preprocessing, feature selection and engineering, model development and validation, and ethical considerations in conducting research in this field.
