    "abstract": "We study the convergence of $Q$-learning with linear function approximation. Our key contribution is the introduction of a novel multi-Bellman operator that extends the traditional Bellman operator. By exploring the properties of this operator, we identify conditions under which the projected multi-Bellman operator becomes contractive, providing improved fixed-point guarantees compared to the Bellman operator. To leverage these insights, we propose the multi $Q$-learning algorithm with linear function approximation. We demonstrate that this algorithm converges to the fixed-point of the projected multi-Bellman operator, yielding solutions of arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we validate our approach by applying it to well-known environments, showcasing the effectiveness and applicability of our findings.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了线性函数逼近下$Q$-learning的收敛性。我们的主要贡献是引入了一种新颖的多Bellman算子，该算子扩展了传统的Bellman算子。通过探索该算子的性质，我们确定了在投影的多Bellman算子变为压缩映射时的条件，从而提供了比Bellman算子更好的固定点保证。为了利用这些洞察力，我们提出了具有线性函数逼近的多$Q$-learning算法。我们证明了该算法收敛到投影的多Bellman算子的不动点，从而获得了任意精度的解。最后，我们通过将该方法应用于众所周知的环境来验证我们的方法，展示了我们发现的有效性和适用性。",
