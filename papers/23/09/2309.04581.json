    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了在将多边形网格资产嵌入到逼真的神经辐射场 (NeRF) 体积中，以便以与 NeRF 物理一致的方式进行渲染和动力学模拟的系统视角。设计了在渲染和模拟过程中网格与 NeRF 之间的双向耦合。首先回顾了网格和 NeRF 的光传输方程，然后将它们总结为一种沿着任意反射次数的光线更新辐射和透过率的高效算法。为了解决路径追踪器所假设的线性色彩空间和标准 NeRF 使用的 sRGB 色彩空间之间的差异，我们使用高动态范围 (HDR) 图像训练了 NeRF。还提出了一种估计 NeRF 上的光源并投射阴影的策略。最后，考虑了如何将混合表面-体积表达式与高性能的图形渲染框架高效集成。",
