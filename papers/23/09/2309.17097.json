In this paper, we address a prostate segmentation problem from MRI in a collaborative scenario by comparing two different approaches: federated learning (FL) and consensus-based methods (CBM).  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in which CBM, such as label fusion techniques, are used to solve a problem of collaborative learning. In this setting, CBM combine predictions from locally trained models to obtain a federated strong learner with ideally improved robustness and predictive variance proper",

    "translated_abstract": "医疗数据通常被分割成多个医院的中小型集合，并且由于隐私规定的限制，访问这些数据变得困难。这给使用这些数据来开发机器学习和深度学习模型带来了困难，而这些模型以数据为基础。克服这个限制的方法之一是使用协作学习（CL）方法，这允许医院在不需要显式共享本地数据的情况下共同解决一个任务。在本文中，我们通过比较两种不同的方法来解决协作场景下的MRI前列腺分割问题：联邦学习（FL）和基于共识的方法（CBM）。据我们所知，这是第一次使用包括标签融合技术在内的CBM解决协作学习问题。在这个设置中，CBM将来自本地训练模型的预测进行组合，以获得具有理想增强鲁棒性和预测方差的联邦强学习模型。",
