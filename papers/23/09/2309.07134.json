    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一个计算效率高的机器学习模型，用于在物联网环境中利用静息状态脑电信号（rs-EEG）对帕金森病（PD）进行诊断和监测。我们计算了不同类型的熵，并发现模糊熵在使用rs-EEG进行PD诊断和监测方面表现最好。我们还研究了不同信号频率范围和脑电通道的组合，以准确诊断PD。最后，在较少的特征（11个特征）下，我们实现了约99.9%的最大分类准确度（ARKF）。我们确定了最明显的脑电信号频率范围，并发现高分类准确度取决于低频信号成分（0-4 Hz）。此外，最具信息量的信号主要来自头部的右半球（F8、P8、T8、FC6）。此外，我们还评估了使用三种不同长度的E",
