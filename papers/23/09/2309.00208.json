    "translated_abstract": "在快速发展的人工智能领域中，OpenAI的GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4等最先进的语言模型为自动化复杂任务提供了前所未有的机会。本研究深入探讨了这些模型在韩国情境下语义分析公司披露的能力，特别是对及时披露的能力。研究聚焦于韩国KOSPI上市的市值前50家上市公司，并在17个月的时间内详细审查了它们的月度披露摘要。每个摘要都按照从1（非常负面）到5（非常正面）的比例进行了情感评级。为了衡量语言模型的有效性，将它们的情感评级与人工专家生成的评级进行了比较。我们的研究结果显示了GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4之间明显的性能差异，后者在人类评估测试中展现出了显著的准确性。",
