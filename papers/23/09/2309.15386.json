    "translated_abstract": "我们在非意图辐射发射（URE）分类的背景下，对ResNet-like模型的鲁棒性和可解释性进行了全面评估，并提出了一种利用神经随机微分方程（SDEs）来解决已发现限制的新方法。我们通过实验证明了ResNet-like模型对高斯噪声扰动的脆弱性，当高斯噪声仅为0.5标准差时，模型性能急剧下降，其F1-score降至接近无意义的0.008。我们还强调了一个令人担忧的不一致性，即ResNet-like模型提供的解释不反映输入数据中固有的周期性，在稳定设备中进行URE检测时这是一个关键属性。针对这些发现，我们提出了一种新的应用神经SDEs构建URE分类模型的方法，这些模型不仅对噪声具有鲁棒性，还能提供更有意义和直观的解释。",
