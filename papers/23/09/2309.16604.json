    "translated_abstract": "图的成对比较在机器学习中的许多应用中至关重要，包括聚类、基于核的分类/回归以及最近的监督图预测。图之间的距离通常依赖于这些结构化对象的信息表达，如子结构包或其他图嵌入。一种最近流行的解决方案是将图表示为度量测度空间，这样可以成功地利用最优输运，它提供了有意义的距离来比较它们：Gromov-Wasserstein距离。然而，这类距离忽略了边属性，而这对于许多结构化对象是至关重要的。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一种扩展Gromov-Wasserstein距离的方法，用于比较具有节点和边特征的图。我们提出了距离和重心计算的新算法。我们通过实验证明了新距离在图出现在输入和输出的学习任务中的有效性",
