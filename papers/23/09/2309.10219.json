Secondly, semantic conflicts and information redundancy caused by feature fusion are not attended to. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach for polyp segmentation, named MLFF-Net, which leverages multi-level feature fusion and attention mechanisms. Specifically, MLFF-Net comprises three modules: Multi-scale Attention Module (MAM), High-level Feature Enhancement Module (HFEM), and Global Attention Module (GAM). Among these, MAM is used to extract multi-scale information and polyp details from the shallow output of the encoder. In HFEM, the deep features of the encoders",

    "translated_abstract": "临床上，自动化的息肉分割技术有潜力显著提高医学诊断的效率和准确性，从而降低患者患结直肠癌的风险。然而，现有方法存在两个显著弱点可能影响分割的准确性。首先，编码器提取的特征未经充分滤波和利用。其次，由特征融合引起的语义冲突和信息冗余没有得到关注。为了克服这些局限性，我们提出了一种新的息肉分割方法，名为 MLFF-Net，它利用多层次特征融合和注意力机制。具体而言，MLFF-Net 包括三个模块：多尺度注意力模块（MAM）、高层特征增强模块（HFEM）和全局注意力模块（GAM）。其中，MAM 用于从编码器的浅层输出中提取多尺度信息和息肉细节。在 HFEM 中，编码器的深层特征可以被进一步增强。",
