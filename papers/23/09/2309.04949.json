    "translated_abstract": "引用成熟时间因文章而异，然而所有文章的影响力都是在一个固定窗口内衡量的。对它们的引用轨迹进行聚类有助于理解知识扩散过程，并揭示并非所有文章在发表后都立即获得成功。此外，对轨迹进行聚类也对论文影响力推荐算法至关重要。由于引用时间序列具有非线性和非平稳特性，这是一个具有挑战性的问题。先前的工作提出了一组任意的阈值和基于规则的固定方法。所有的方法主要都依赖于参数，因此在定义相似的轨迹和关于特定数目的模糊性方面导致了不一致性。大多数研究只捕捉了极端的轨迹。因此，需要一个通用的聚类框架。本文提出了一个基于特征的多个k-means聚类集成框架。",
