    "translated_abstract": "说话人验证（SV）广泛应用于移动系统中，通过使用用户的语音特征来认证合法用户。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为MASTERKEY的后门攻击，以破坏SV模型。与以往的攻击不同，我们关注的是在攻击者对目标用户没有任何了解的实际环境下进行攻击。为了设计MASTERKEY，我们调查了现有的针对未见目标的中毒攻击的局限性。然后，我们优化了一个通用的后门，可以攻击任意目标。接下来，我们将说话人的特征和语义信息嵌入到后门中，使其不可察觉。最后，我们估计了信道失真，并将其集成到后门中。我们验证了我们的攻击对6个流行的SV模型。具体而言，我们中毒了共计53个模型，并使用我们的触发器攻击了16,430个注册说话人，其中包括在53个中毒模型中注册的310个目标说话人。我们的攻击成功率达到100％。",

    "en_tdlr": "This work presents a backdoor attack called MASTERKEY against speaker verification systems. Unlike previous attacks, it focuses on a practical setting where the attacker has no knowledge of the target user. By embedding speaker characteristics and semantics information, as well as integrating channel distortion, our attack can successfully compromise multiple popular SV models with a 100% attack success rate."
