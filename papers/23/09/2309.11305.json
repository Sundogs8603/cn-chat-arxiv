    "translated_abstract": "在连续学习领域中，灾难性遗忘仍然是一个严重的挑战，神经网络在吸收新信息时很难保留先前的知识。大多数现有研究只注重在遇到新任务时缓解这个问题，忽视了任务前阶段的重要性。因此，我们将注意力转移到当前任务学习阶段，提出了一个新的框架C&F（创建和发现平面），该框架为每个任务提前建立一个平坦的训练空间。具体来说，在学习当前任务时，我们的框架自适应地创建了一个在损失空间中最小值周围的平坦区域。随后，它根据参数的平坦度找到它们对当前任务的重要性。在适应模型到新任务时，根据平坦度应用约束，并同时为即将到来的任务准备一个平坦空间。我们在理论上证明了创建和发现平坦度之间的一致性。",

The framework adaptively creates a flat region during the learning of the current task and determines the importance of parameters based on their flatness degrees. When adapting to a new task, constraints are applied using flatness, and a flat space is prepared for the new task."
