    "abstract": "Creating accurate predictions in the stock market has always been a significant challenge in finance. With the rise of machine learning as the next level in the forecasting area, this research paper compares four machine learning models and their accuracy in forecasting three well-known stocks traded in the NYSE in the short term from March 2020 to May 2022. We deploy, develop, and tune XGBoost, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron, and Support Vector Regression models. We report the models that produce the highest accuracies from our evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAPE, MTT, and MPE. Using a training data set of 240 trading days, we find that XGBoost gives the highest accuracy despite running longer (up to 10 seconds). Results from this study may improve by further tuning the individual parameters or introducing more exogenous variables.",

    "translated_abstract": "在金融领域中，准确预测股票市场一直是一个重要的挑战。随着机器学习作为预测领域的下一级别的崛起，本研究论文比较了四种机器学习模型在2020年3月到2022年5月期间短期预测纽约证券交易所中三个知名股票的准确性。我们使用了XGBoost、随机森林、多层感知器和支持向量回归模型进行开发、调优和部署。我们根据RMSE、MAPE、MTT和MPE这些评估指标报告了产生最高准确性的模型。在使用240个交易日的训练数据集后，我们发现XGBoost尽管运行时间较长（高达10秒），但给出了最高准确性。进一步调整各个参数或引入更多外生变量可以改进本研究的结果。",
