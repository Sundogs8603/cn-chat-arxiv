    "translated_abstract": "最近，像ChatGPT这样的大型语言模型（LLM）的发展取得了显著的性能，通过利用人类专业知识。然而，充分揭示LLMs在复杂任务中的潜力需要在自然语言提示的广阔搜索空间中进行导航。虽然提示工程显示出潜力，但试错尝试中所需的人工设计提示和相关成本带来了重大挑战。关键是，提示优化的效率取决于昂贵的提示评估过程。本工作介绍了Prompt-OIRL，这是一种基于离线逆向强化学习的方法，旨在弥合有效提示评估和可负担性之间的差距。我们的方法利用专家评估的离线数据集，运用逆向强化学习获得一个针对离线、查询依赖型提示评估的奖励模型。Prompt-OIRL的优点是多方面的：它预测提示的性能，成本高效，生成易读的结果。",
