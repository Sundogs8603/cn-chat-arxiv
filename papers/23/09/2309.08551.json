    "abstract": "Online speech recognition, where the model only accesses context to the left, is an important and challenging use case for ASR systems. In this work, we investigate augmenting neural encoders for online ASR by incorporating structured state-space sequence models (S4), which are a family of models that provide a parameter-efficient way of accessing arbitrarily long left context. We perform systematic ablation studies to compare variants of S4 models and propose two novel approaches that combine them with convolutions. We find that the most effective design is to stack a small S4 using real-valued recurrent weights with a local convolution, allowing them to work complementarily. Our best model achieves WERs of 4.01%/8.53% on test sets from Librispeech, outperforming Conformers with extensively tuned convolution.",

    "translated_abstract": "在线语音识别是一种重要且具有挑战性的ASR系统应用场景，其中模型只能访问左侧上下文。本文研究通过结合结构化状态空间序列模型（S4）增强在线ASR的神经编码器，S4是一类提供了访问任意长左侧上下文的参数高效方式的模型。我们进行了系统的消融实验，比较了S4模型的各个变种，并提出了两种将其与卷积相结合的新方法。我们发现，最有效的设计是使用具有实值循环权重的小型S4模型与本地卷积相叠加，使它们可以互补地工作。我们的最佳模型在来自Librispeech的测试集上取得了4.01%/8.53%的WER，优于经过详细调优的Conformers。",
