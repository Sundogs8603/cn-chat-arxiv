Addressing this challenge by successfully sharing information across tasks will depend on how well the structure underlying the tasks is captured. In this work, we introduce our new architecture, Projected Task-Specific Layers (PTSL), that leverages a common policy with dense task-specific corrections through task-specific layers to better express shared and variable task information. We then show that our model outperforms the state of the art on the MT10 and MT50 benchmarks of Meta-World consisting of 10 and 50 goal-conditioned tasks for a Sawyer arm.",

    "translated_abstract": "多任务强化学习可以使机器人在家庭和工作场所的各种操作任务中实现规模化。然而，从一个任务推广到另一个任务并减轻负面任务干扰仍然是一个挑战。成功地在任务之间共享信息并取得良好效果将取决于对任务底层结构的有效捕捉。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一种新的架构，即Projected Task-Specific Layers（PTSL），它通过任务特定的层，通过稠密的任务特定的修正来更好地表达共享和可变的任务信息。然后，我们展示了我们的模型在Meta-World的MT10和MT50基准中（包括Sawyer机器人臂上的10个和50个目标条件任务）的表现优于现有技术水平。",
