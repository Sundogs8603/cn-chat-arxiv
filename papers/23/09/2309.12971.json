    "translated_abstract": "尽管普通图神经网络（GNNs）在许多任务上取得了成功，但其基于配对交互网络的基础本质上限制了其识别复杂系统中潜在高阶交互的能力。为了弥补这种能力差距，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，利用复杂系统的高阶交互建模的丰富数学理论，即简单复合体（SCs）-一种对建模高阶交互具有鲁棒性的工具。目前基于SC的GNNs存在复杂度高和刻板的问题，并且量化高阶交互强度仍然具有挑战性。创新地，我们提出了一个高阶花瓣（FP）模型，将FP拉普拉斯引入到SC中。此外，我们引入了一个以FP拉普拉斯为基础的高阶图卷积网络（HiGCN），能够识别不同拓扑尺度上的内在特征。通过使用可学习的图滤波器，FP拉普拉斯域内的参数组，我们可以识别出具有不同模式的图案，其中滤波器的权重用作数量化高阶交互的工具。",
