    "translated_abstract": "众包平台提供了大量包含有价值建筑信息的街景图像。本研究解决了在应用场景文本识别（STR）进行建筑属性映射时的挑战。我们使用了Flickr图像，特别是研究了建筑外墙上的文本。创建了一个柏林Flickr数据集，并使用预训练的STR模型进行文本检测和识别。对STR识别图像的子集进行手动检查，结果显示高准确性。我们研究了STR结果与建筑功能之间的相关性，并分析了在住宅建筑上识别到文本但在商业建筑上未识别到的情况。进一步调查发现了与这一任务相关的重大挑战，包括街景图像中的小文本区域，缺乏真实标签以及Flickr图像中的建筑与OpenStreetMap（OSM）中的建筑足迹不匹配。为了开发城市范围的映射，超越城市热点区域，",
