    "translated_abstract": "深度学习（DL）技术最近被应用于异常检测（AD），在金融、医疗服务和云计算等领域取得了成功的成果。然而，目前的研究往往将深度AD算法作为一个整体进行评估，未能理解个别设计选择（如损失函数和网络架构）的贡献。因此，原始步骤（如预处理）的重要性可能被新颖的损失函数和架构所掩盖。在本文中，我们通过提出两个问题来解决这些疏漏：（i）深度AD方法的哪些组成部分（即设计选择）在检测异常方面是至关重要的？（ii）我们如何通过自动选择最佳设计选择来构建针对特定数据集的定制AD算法，而不是依赖通用的、预先存在的解决方案？为此，我们介绍了ADGym，这是第一个用于全面评估和自动选择AD的平台。",
