    "abstract": "Text-based speech editing (TSE) techniques are designed to enable users to edit the output audio by modifying the input text transcript instead of the audio itself. Despite much progress in neural network-based TSE techniques, the current techniques have focused on reducing the difference between the generated speech segment and the reference target in the editing region, ignoring its local and global fluency in the context and original utterance. To maintain the speech fluency, we propose a fluency speech editing model, termed \\textit{FluentEditor}, by considering fluency-aware training criterion in the TSE training. Specifically, the \\textit{acoustic consistency constraint} aims to smooth the transition between the edited region and its neighboring acoustic segments consistent with the ground truth, while the \\textit{prosody consistency constraint} seeks to ensure that the prosody attributes within the edited regions remain consistent with the overall style of the original utterance.",

    "translated_abstract": "文本化语音编辑（TSE）技术旨在使用户通过修改输入的文本转录而不是音频本身来编辑生成的音频。尽管神经网络基础的TSE技术取得了很大进展，但目前的技术主要关注于减小编辑区域中生成的语音片段与参考目标之间的差异，忽视了其在上下文和原始语句中的局部和整体流畅性。为了保持语音的流畅性，我们提出了一种流畅语音编辑模型，称为“FluentEditor”，通过考虑流畅度意识的训练准则进行TSE训练。具体而言，“声学一致性约束”旨在使编辑区域与其相邻的声学片段之间的过渡变得平滑并与真实情况保持一致，“韵律一致性约束”旨在确保编辑区域内的韵律属性与原始语句的整体风格保持一致。",
