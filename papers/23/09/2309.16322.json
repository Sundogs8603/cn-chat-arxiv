    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统依赖于历史点击以学习用户兴趣并提供合适的物品。然而，当前的研究倾向于平等对待点击，这可能忽视了不同点击中用户兴趣的不同强度。本文旨在通过自蒸馏实现推荐中的多粒度点击置信度学习（CLSD）。由于点击置信度缺乏监督信号，我们首先通过全局自蒸馏方法应用自监督学习来获取点击置信度分数。然后，我们定义一种局部置信度函数，以适应用户组水平上的置信度分数，因为置信度分布可能在用户组之间有所不同。通过多粒度置信度学习的结合，我们可以准确区分点击的质量，更准确地建模用户兴趣，而不需要额外的数据和模型结构。在工业离线和在线实验中，得到了不同骨架的显著改进。",
