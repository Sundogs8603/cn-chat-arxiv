    "translated_abstract": "最近在稠密场外分布检测方面的进展主要集中在训练和测试数据集具有相似领域的情况下，假设它们之间不存在领域转移。然而，实际情况下常常存在领域转移，并且显著影响现有场外分布检测模型的准确性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个双层场外分布检测框架，同时处理领域转移和语义转移。第一层利用全局低级特征区分图像中是否存在领域转移，而第二层利用密集高级特征图识别具有语义转移的像素。通过这种方式，我们可以有选择地适应模型到未见领域，并增强模型在检测新类别方面的能力。我们在几个场外分割基准上验证了我们提出的方法的有效性，包括 those with significant domain shifts and those without。",
