    "translated_abstract": "当前的推荐系统使用具有统一维度的大型嵌入表，导致过拟合、高计算成本和次优的泛化性能。许多技术旨在通过特征选择或嵌入维度搜索来解决这个问题。然而，这些技术通常为所有实例选择一组固定的特征子集或嵌入维度，并将所有实例都输入到一个推荐模型中，而不考虑物品或用户之间的异质性。本文提出了一种新颖的实例级层次结构搜索框架iHAS，它可以自动在实例级别上进行神经网络架构搜索。具体而言，iHAS包括三个阶段:搜索、聚类和重训练。在搜索阶段，通过精心设计的伯努利门和正则化器，iHAS识别出不同字段特征上的最优实例级嵌入维度。在获得这些维度后，聚类阶段将实例分成不同的类别。",
