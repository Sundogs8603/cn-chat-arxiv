    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)展示了显著的能力，正在改变人工智能的发展并有可能塑造我们的未来。然而，由于LLMs的多模态特性，当前的基于云的部署面临着一些关键挑战：1) 响应时间长；2) 高带宽成本；以及3) 违反数据隐私。6G移动边缘计算(MEC)系统可能解决这些迫切问题。本文探讨了在6G边缘部署LLMs的潜力。我们首先介绍了由多模态LLMs提供支持的关键应用，包括机器人技术和医疗保健，以突出在终端用户附近部署LLMs的需求。然后，我们确定了在边缘部署LLMs时面临的关键挑战，并设想了适用于LLMs的6G MEC架构。此外，我们深入探讨了两个设计方面，即LLMs的边缘训练和边缘推理。在这两个方面，考虑到边缘的固有资源限制，我们讨论了各种前沿技术。",
