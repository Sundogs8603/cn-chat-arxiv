    "abstract": "This paper presents RadOnc-GPT, a large language model specialized for radiation oncology through advanced tuning methods. RadOnc-GPT was finetuned on a large dataset of radiation oncology patient records and clinical notes from the Mayo Clinic. The model employs instruction tuning on three key tasks generating radiotherapy treatment regimens, determining optimal radiation modalities, and providing diagnostic descriptions/ICD codes based on patient diagnostic details. Evaluations conducted by having radiation oncologists compare RadOnc-GPT impressions to general large language model impressions showed that RadOnc-GPT generated outputs with significantly improved clarity, specificity, and clinical relevance. The study demonstrated the potential of using large language models fine-tuned using domain-specific knowledge like RadOnc-GPT to achieve transformational capabilities in highly specialized healthcare fields such as radiation oncology.",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文介绍了一种名为RadOnc-GPT的大型语言模型，通过先进的调整方法专门用于放射肿瘤学。RadOnc-GPT在Mayo Clinic的大量放射肿瘤学患者记录和临床笔记数据集上进行了微调。该模型通过三个关键任务进行指令调整，包括生成放射治疗方案、确定最佳放射疗法以及基于患者诊断细节提供诊断描述/ICD代码。通过将放射肿瘤学医生比较RadOnc-GPT的印象与通用大型语言模型的印象进行评估，研究表明RadOnc-GPT生成的输出在清晰度、特异度和临床相关性方面显著提高。该研究证明了利用像RadOnc-GPT这样利用领域特定知识进行微调的大型语言模型在放射肿瘤学等高度专业化的医疗领域实现变革能力的潜力。",
