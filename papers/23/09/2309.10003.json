    "abstract": "This work proposes to measure the scope of a patent claim as the reciprocal of the self-information contained in this claim. Grounded in information theory, this approach is based on the assumption that a rare concept is more informative than a usual concept, inasmuch as it is more surprising. The self-information is calculated from the probability of occurrence of that claim, where the probability is calculated in accordance with a language model. Five language models are considered, ranging from the simplest models (each word or character is drawn from a uniform distribution) to intermediate models (using average word or character frequencies), to a large language model (GPT2). Interestingly, the simplest language models reduce the scope measure to the reciprocal of the word or character count, a metric already used in previous works. Application is made to nine series of patent claims directed to distinct inventions, where the claims in each series have a gradually decreasing scope.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种将专利权要求的范围测量为该要求所包含的自信息的倒数的方法。这种方法基于信息论，基于一个假设，即罕见的概念比平常的概念更具信息量，因为它更令人惊讶。自信息是从该要求的发生概率计算得出的，其中概率是根据语言模型计算的。本文考虑了五个语言模型，从最简单的模型（每个单词或字符均从均匀分布中抽取）到中等模型（使用平均词或字符频率），再到一个大型语言模型（GPT2）。有趣的是，最简单的语言模型将范围度量减少为单词或字符计数的倒数，这是先前作品中已经使用的度量标准。该方法应用于九个系列的针对不同发明的专利权要求，其中每个系列的要求范围逐渐减小。",
