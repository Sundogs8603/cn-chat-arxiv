However, few approaches has been made toward a complete AI-powered tutoring system. In this work, we explore the development of a full-fledged intelligent tutoring system powered by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), covering automatic course planning and adjusting, tailored instruction, and flexible quiz evaluation. To make the system robust to prolonged interaction and cater to individualized education, the system is decomposed into three inter-connected core processes-interaction, reflection, and reaction. Each process is implemented by chaining LLM-powered tools along with dynamically updated memory modules. Tools are LLMs prompted to execute one specific task at a time, while memories are data storage that gets updated during education process.

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能已被应用于在线教育的各个方面，以促进教学和学习。然而，很少有方法致力于完整的AI辅导系统。在这项工作中，我们探讨了一个由最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）驱动的全面智能辅导系统的开发，涵盖自动课程规划和调整、定制指导以及灵活的测验评估。为了使系统能够经受住长时间交互并满足个性化教育的需求，系统被分解为三个相互连接的核心流程-交互、反思和反应。每个流程都通过链接LLM驱动的工具以及动态更新的记忆模块来实现。工具是LLMs，被提示执行一项特定任务，而记忆是在教育过程中更新的数据存储。学习日志中的统计结果证明了这种方法的有效性。",
