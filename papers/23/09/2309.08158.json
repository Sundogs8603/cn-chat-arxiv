    "abstract": "The need for improved network situational awareness has been highlighted by the growing complexity and severity of cyber-attacks. Mobile phones pose a significant risk to network situational awareness due to their dynamic behaviour and lack of visibility on a network. Machine learning techniques enhance situational awareness by providing administrators insight into the devices and activities which form their network. Developing machine learning techniques for situational awareness requires a testbed to generate and label network traffic. Current testbeds, however, are unable to automate the generation and labelling of realistic network traffic. To address this, we describe a testbed which automates applications on mobile devices to generate and label realistic traffic. From this testbed, two labelled datasets of network traffic have been created. We provide an analysis of the testbed automation reliability and benchmark the datasets for the task of application classification.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着网络攻击的复杂性和严重性增加，对改进网络态势感知的需求日益凸显。由于移动电话的动态行为和在网络上的缺乏可见性，它们对网络态势感知构成了重大威胁。机器学习技术通过向管理员提供有关构成其网络的设备和活动的见解，增强了态势感知。为了开发用于态势感知的机器学习技术，需要一个能够生成和标记网络流量的测试平台。然而，当前的测试平台无法自动化生成和标记逼真的网络流量。为了解决这个问题，我们描述了一个测试平台，该平台可以自动化移动设备上的应用程序以生成和标记逼真的流量。通过这个测试平台，我们创建了两个标记的网络流量数据集。我们对测试平台的自动化可靠性进行了分析，并对这些数据集进行了应用程序分类任务的基准测试。",
