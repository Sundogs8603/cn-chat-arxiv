    "translated_abstract": "未结构化的电子健康记录（EHR）数据通常包含与影像数据互补的关键信息，可以为放射科医生的诊断提供帮助。然而，时间限制和与每个患者相关的大量笔记使得手动浏览此类数据以识别相关证据在实践中变得不可行。现代的大型语言模型（LLMs）提供了一种灵活的方式来处理未结构化的EHR数据，并可以提供一种机制来高效地检索和总结与给定查询相关的未结构化证据。在这项工作中，我们提出并评估了一个LLM（Flan-T5 XXL）来实现这个目的。具体而言，在零样本条件下，我们要求LLM推断一个患者是否有或处于某种特定疾病的风险，并在是的情况下提示模型总结支持的证据。通过引入放射科医生进行手动评估，我们发现这种基于LLM的方法提供的输出始终优于标准的信息检索基准方法。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一种使用大型语言模型（LLMs）从未结构化的电子健康记录（EHR）中检索和总结相关证据的方法。通过在零样本条件下训练LLM来推断患者是否患有特定疾病，并且模型可以总结支持的证据。该方法在实践中被证明优于传统的信息检索方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes a method to retrieve and summarize relevant evidence from unstructured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data using Large Language Models (LLMs). By training the LLM in a zero-shot setting to infer whether a patient has a specific disease and summarize the supporting evidence, this approach has been found to outperform traditional information retrieval methods in practice."
