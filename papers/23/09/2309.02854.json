    "translated_abstract": "日志数据存储与系统或应用程序的底层工作流相对应的事件执行模式。虽然大多数日志具有信息性，但日志数据中也包含指示故障或事故的痕迹。因此，日志数据常用于评估旨在自动揭示意外或其他相关系统行为模式的异常检测技术。最近，利用深度学习的检测方法越来越关注以序列模式的变化为特征的异常，在一般事件追踪中。一些公开可用的数据集，如HDFS，BGL，Thunderbird，OpenStack和Hadoop，已成为评估这些异常检测技术的标准，然而，过去对这些数据集的适用性并未得到仔细研究。因此，在本文中，我们对六个公开可用的日志数据集进行分析，重点关注异常的表现形式和其检测的简单技术。我们的发现",
