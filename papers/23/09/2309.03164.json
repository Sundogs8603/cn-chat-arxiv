    "translated_abstract": "AI生成文本在网络上的迅速扩张正在深刻地改变信息格局。在各种类型的AI生成文本中，AI生成新闻作为一种显著的来源，对网络上的误导信息构成了重大威胁。虽然最近有一些努力致力于对AI生成文本的检测，但考虑到其面临的简单对抗攻击的易受攻击性，这些方法需要更高的可靠性。此外，由于新闻写作的特异性，将这些检测方法应用于AI生成新闻可能会产生误报，潜在地破坏新闻机构的声誉。为解决这些挑战，我们利用一个跨学科团队的专门知识来开发一个名为J-Guard的框架，该框架可以引导现有的基于监督的AI文本检测器以检测AI生成新闻，并提升对抗鲁棒性。通过引入受独特新闻属性启发的文体暗示，J-Guard能有效抵制对抗攻击并降低误报率。",
    "tldr": "J-Guard是一个能够在AI生成新闻中检测AI生成文本的框架，通过引入新闻属性和提高对抗鲁棒性，解决了现有方法的不可靠性和误报问题。",
    "en_tdlr": "J-Guard is a framework for detecting AI-generated text in AI-generated news, which addresses the unreliability and false positive issues of existing methods by incorporating news attributes and improving adversarial robustness."
