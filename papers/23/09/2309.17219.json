    "abstract": "The Average Oracle, a simple and very fast covariance filtering method, is shown to yield superior Sharpe ratios than the current state-of-the-art (and complex) methods, Dynamic Conditional Covariance coupled to Non-Linear Shrinkage (DCC+NLS). We pit all the known variants of DCC+NLS (quadratic shrinkage, gross-leverage or turnover limitations, and factor-augmented NLS) against the Average Oracle in large-scale randomized experiments. We find generically that while some variants of DCC+NLS sometimes yield the lowest average realized volatility, albeit with a small improvement, their excessive gross leverage and investment concentration, and their 10-time larger turnover contribute to smaller average portfolio returns, which mechanically result in smaller realized Sharpe ratios than the Average Oracle. We also provide simple analytical arguments about the origin of the advantage of the Average Oracle over NLS in a changing world.",

    "translated_abstract": "这项研究展示了简单且非常快速的协方差筛选方法平均oracle相较于当前最先进且复杂的动态条件协方差与非线性收缩方法（DCC+NLS）具有更高的夏普比率。我们在大规模随机实验中将所有已知的DCC+NLS变体（二次收缩、总体杠杆或换手限制以及因子增强的NLS）与平均oracle进行对比。我们普遍发现，虽然某些DCC+NLS的变体有时能够产生最低的平均实现波动率，尽管即使是略微改进，但它们过于高的总体杠杆和投资集中度，以及10倍较大的换手率导致较小的平均投资组合收益，从而机械地导致比平均oracle更小的实现夏普比率。我们还通过简单的分析论证了在不断变化的世界中平均oracle优于NLS的优势的起源。",
