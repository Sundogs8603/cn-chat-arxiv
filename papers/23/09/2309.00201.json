    "translated_abstract": "模型选择是无监督机器学习中必要的步骤。尽管有很多标准和指标，但模型选择仍然存在主观性。高度主观性可能会对各种机器学习研究的重复性和可再现性产生疑问，并对实际部署的模型的稳健性产生怀疑。然而，模型选择结果中模型构建者的偏好影响的影响尚未得到充分探索。本研究以隐马尔可夫模型为例，调查了模型选择中的主观性。我们邀请了33位参与者和三个大型语言模型（LLMs），在三个场景中进行模型选择。结果显示，无论是参与者还是LLMs的选择都存在变异性和不一致性，尤其是当不同的标准和指标存在分歧时。主观性来源包括对不同标准和指标重要性的不同意见，对模型应该有多简洁的不同看法，以及对数据规模的大小的看法。",
