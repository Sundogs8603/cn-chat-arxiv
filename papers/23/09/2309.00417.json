    "abstract": "The paper explores a different variation of combined regression strategy to calculate the conditional survival function. We use regression based weak learners to create the proposed ensemble technique. The proposed combined regression strategy uses proximity measure as area between two survival curves. The proposed model shows a construction which ensures that it performs better than the Random Survival Forest. The paper discusses a novel technique to select the most important variable in the combined regression setup. We perform a simulation study to show that our proposition for finding relevance of the variables works quite well. We also use three real-life datasets to illustrate the model.",
