    "translated_abstract": "个性化的运动计划对于确保足够的体育活动至关重要，但由于人们的复杂日程和考虑因素以及计划的创建通常需要与专家的反复沟通，这一过程变得具有挑战性。我们提出了PlanFitting，它是一个对话型人工智能，可以辅助个性化的运动计划。通过利用大型语言模型的生成能力，PlanFitting使用户能够用自然语言描述各种约束和查询，从而便于创建和优化适合其特定情况的每周运动计划，并保持基本原则的扎根。通过一项用户研究，参与者（N=18）使用PlanFitting生成个性化的运动计划，而专家规划者（N=3）对这些计划进行评估，我们确定了PlanFitting在生成个性化、可操作和有据可依的运动计划方面的潜力。我们还讨论了AI助手在创建计划方面的未来设计机遇。",
