    "translated_abstract": "创建一个有效的表示空间对于降低维数灾难、增强模型泛化能力、解决数据稀疏性以及更有效地利用经典模型至关重要。最近的自动特征工程（AutoFE）的进展在解决表示学习中的各种挑战方面取得了重大进展，例如对大量劳动和经验的依赖、缺乏可解释性和在下游任务中嵌入刚性特征空间重建问题。然而，这些方法受到以下限制：1）产生潜在的难以理解和不合常理的重构特征空间，源于忽视专家级的认知过程；2）缺乏系统的探索，进而导致模型收敛缓慢以找到最佳特征空间。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了一种交互感知的增强生成方法。我们重新定义了特征空间的生成过程，以充分利用领域专家的认知过程和系统的探索。",
