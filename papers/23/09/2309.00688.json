    "abstract": "Federated and Continual Learning have emerged as potential paradigms for the robust and privacy-aware use of Deep Learning in dynamic environments. However, Client Drift and Catastrophic Forgetting are fundamental obstacles to guaranteeing consistent performance. Existing work only addresses these problems separately, which neglects the fact that the root cause behind both forms of performance deterioration is connected. We propose a unified analysis framework for building a controlled test environment for Client Drift -- by perturbing a defined ratio of clients -- and Catastrophic Forgetting -- by shifting all clients with a particular strength. Our framework further leverages this new combined analysis by generating a 3D landscape of the combined performance impact from both. We demonstrate that the performance drop through Client Drift, caused by a certain share of shifted clients, is correlated to the drop from Catastrophic Forgetting resulting from a corresponding shift strength.

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习和连续学习已经被提出作为在动态环境中稳健和隐私意识的使用深度学习的潜在范式。然而，客户漂移和灾难性遗忘是保证一致性性能的基本障碍。现有的工作只是分别解决这些问题，忽视了这两种性能下降背后的根本原因是联系在一起的事实。我们提出了一个统一的分析框架，用于构建一个受控的测试环境，以探索客户漂移 - 通过扰动一定比例的客户 - 和灾难性遗忘 - 通过以特定强度迁移所有客户 - 的影响。我们的框架通过生成一个从两者的组合性能影响产生的3D地形图进一步利用这种新的组合分析。我们证明了通过客户漂移引起的性能下降，通过一定比例的迁移客户，与由相应的迁移强度引起的灾难性遗忘的性能下降相关。",
