    "translated_abstract": "当前针对联邦学习（FL）的后门攻击在很大程度上依赖于通用触发器或语义模式，这可以被某些防御机制（如范数剪裁，比较局部更新之间的参数差异）轻易检测和过滤。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的隐蔽且强健的具有灵活触发器的联邦学习后门攻击。为了实现这一点，我们构建了一个生成触发器函数，可以学习使用一个几乎不可察觉的灵活触发器模式来操作良性样本，并同时让触发器模式包含攻击者选择的标签的最重要的隐藏特征。此外，我们的触发器生成器可以在不同轮次中不断学习和适应，从而使其能够调整到全局模型的变化。通过填充可区分的差异（触发器模式和目标标签之间的映射），我们使我们的攻击具有自然的隐蔽性。对真实数据集的大量实验验证了我们攻击的有效性和可靠性。",

It generates a trigger pattern to manipulate benign samples while incorporating the most significant hidden features of the target label chosen by the attacker. By filling distinguishable differences, the attack achieves stealthiness. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and reliability of this method."
