We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducing hallucinations with pretrained LLMs that does not require conditioning on retrieved external knowledge nor additional fine-tuning. Our approach obtains the next-token distribution by contrasting the differences in logits obtained from projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary space, exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shown to be localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa) approach is able to better surface factual knowledge and reduce the generation of incorrect facts.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）具有令人印象深刻的能力，但它们容易出现幻觉，即生成与预训练期间观察到的事实偏离的内容。我们提出了一种简单的解码策略，用于减少预训练LLMs中的幻觉，它不需要在检索的外部知识或额外的微调上进行条件约束。我们的方法通过对比将较晚层和较早层投影到词汇空间得到的逻辑差异来获得下一个令牌的分布，利用了LLMs中的事实知识通常被证明局部化在特定的Transformer层中的事实。我们发现，这种通过对比层次的解码（DoLa）方法能够更好地展示事实知识，并减少生成不正确事实的情况。DoLa在多个选择任务和开放式生成任务中持续提升了真实性，例如改善了LLaMA系列模型在TruthfulQA上的表现。",
