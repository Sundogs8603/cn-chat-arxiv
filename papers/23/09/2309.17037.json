    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation is devoted to characterizing preferences of anonymous users based on short sessions. Existing methods mostly focus on mining limited item co-occurrence patterns exposed by item ID within sessions, while ignoring what attracts users to engage with certain items is rich multi-modal information displayed on pages. Generally, the multi-modal information can be classified into two categories: descriptive information (e.g., item images and description text) and numerical information (e.g., price). In this paper, we aim to improve session-based recommendation by modeling the above multi-modal information holistically. There are mainly three issues to reveal user intent from multi-modal information: (1) How to extract relevant semantics from heterogeneous descriptive information with different noise? (2) How to fuse these heterogeneous descriptive information to comprehensively infer user interests? (3) How to handle probabilistic influence of numerical information",

    "translated_abstract": "基于会话的推荐旨在根据短会话来揭示匿名用户的偏好。现有的方法主要关注在会话中通过物品ID展示的有限物品共现模式的挖掘，而忽视了用户对特定物品的吸引力是多模态页面上丰富的多模态信息。一般来说，多模态信息可以分为两类: 描述性信息(例如物品图片和描述文本)和数值信息(例如价格)。本文旨在通过整体建模上述多模态信息来改进基于会话的推荐系统。从多模态信息中揭示用户意图主要存在三个问题: (1) 如何从具有不同噪声的异构描述性信息中提取相关语义? (2) 如何综合利用这些异构描述性信息全面推断用户兴趣? (3) 如何处理数值信息的概率影响？",
