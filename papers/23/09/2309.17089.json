    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，提出了一些新的深度学习方法来解决组合优化问题，特别是NP难的车辆路径问题（VRP）。其中最有影响力的方法是顺序神经建模方法，通常通过强化学习进行训练。由于这些模型的高训练成本，它们通常在有限的实例大小上进行训练（例如100个顾客），然后应用于远远更大的实例大小（例如2000个顾客）。通过系统的规模扩展研究，我们发现即使是最先进的神经构建方法也被简单的启发式方法超越，在更大的问题实例上无法泛化。我们提出使用破坏重建原则，交替地完全破坏解决方案的局部部分，然后重新创建一个改进的变体。通过这种方式，像POMO这样的神经构建方法永远不应用于全局问题，而仅用于重建步骤中。",
