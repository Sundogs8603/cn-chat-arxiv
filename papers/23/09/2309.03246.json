    "translated_abstract": "挪威癌症登记处（CRN）通过从挪威的各个医疗实体（例如医学实验室和医院）接收癌症信息来收集关于癌症患者的信息。这些信息由自动化癌症登记系统GURI进行验证。它的正常运行对于癌症研究和向利益相关者提供关键的癌症统计数据至关重要。为GURI构建一个网络病癌双生体（CCDT）可以在不与真实系统进行深入交互的情况下，促进对GURI运行状态的各种实验和高级分析。然而，由于新的医学诊断和治疗、技术进步等原因，GURI不断发展。相应地，CCDT也应该随之演进以与GURI同步。实现这种同步的一个关键挑战是演进的CCDT需要由新的GURI标记的丰富数据。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了EvoCLINICAL，它考虑了为GURI开发的CCDT",
