The jets are placed on a three-dimensional cylinder along its span with the aim of reducing the drag coefficient. The method is based on a deep-reinforcement-learning framework that couples a computational-fluid-dynamics solver with an agent using the proximal-policy-optimization algorithm. We implement a multi-agent reinforcement-learning framework which offers numerous advantages: it exploits local invariants, makes the control adaptable to different geometries, facilitates transfer learning and cross-application of agents and results in significant training speedup. In this contribution we report significant drag reduction after applying the DRL-based control in three different configurations of the problem.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文首次成功展示了通过多个独立控制的零净质量流量合成喷流进行主动流控制的结果。喷流被放置在三维圆柱的跨度上，旨在减小阻力系数。该方法基于将计算流体力学求解器与采用近策略优化算法的智能体耦合的深度强化学习框架。我们实现了一个多智能体强化学习框架，具有多个优势：它利用了局部不变量，使控制适应不同的几何形状，便于迁移学习和智能体的交叉应用，并显著提高了训练速度。在本文中，我们报道了在该深度强化学习控制下，针对三种不同配置的问题实现了显著的阻力减小。",
