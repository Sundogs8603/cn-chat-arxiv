    "translated_abstract": "无监督皮肤病变分割具有多种好处，包括节约专家人力资源、减少主观人工标注引起的差异以及适应新环境。然而，在没有手动标注指导的情况下分割皮肤镜图像存在显著挑战，如毛发噪声、水疱噪声和细微边缘差异等皮肤镜图像伪影。为了应对这些挑战，我们引入了一种创新的不确定性自学习网络（USL-Net）用于皮肤病变分割。USL-Net能够有效地分割各种病变，无需手动标注指导。首先，使用对比学习提取特征，然后使用这些特征生成类激活图（CAMs）作为显著图。不同的CAM位置对应于基于显著性的病变区域的重要性。地图中的高显著区域用作病变区域的伪标签，而低显著区域用作非病变区域的伪标签。",
