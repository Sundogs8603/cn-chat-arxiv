Inspired by cognitive science, we build on Bayesian ToM mechanisms to design teacher agents that, like humans, tailor their teaching strategies to the learners. Our ToM-equipped teachers construct models of learners' internal states from observations and leverage them to select demonstrations that maximise the learners' rewards while minimising teaching costs. Our experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that learners taught this way are more efficient than those taught in a learner-agnostic way. This effect gets stronger when the teacher's model of the learner better aligns with the actual learner's state, either using a more accurate",

    "translated_abstract": "优秀的教师总是根据学习者的情况来进行解释。认知科学家们将这个过程建模为在理性原则下进行的：教师尽可能地最大化学习者的效用同时最小化教学成本。为此，人类教师似乎会建立起学习者内部状态的心智模型，这一能力被称为心智论（Theory of Mind，ToM）。受认知科学的启发，我们借鉴贝叶斯ToM机制来设计类人教师代理，这些代理像人类一样根据学习者来调整教学策略。我们的带有ToM的教师代理根据观察建立起学习者内部状态的模型，并利用这些模型来选择能够最大化学习者回报同时最小化教学成本的示范。我们在模拟环境中的实验证明，以这种方式教授的学习者比以学习者不可知的方式教授的学习者更加高效。当教师对学习者的模型与实际学习者的状态更加一致时，这种效果变得更加显著，其中一种方法是使用更准确的模型。",
