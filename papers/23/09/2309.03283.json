    "translated_abstract": "随着自动驾驶车辆（AV）的出现，交通系统有可能发生转变，为安全、便利和高效的出行提供可能，尤其是在共享系统中使用时（共享AV或SAV）。然而，人们更倾向于将AV作为私人资产拥有，而不是使用SAV。这需要研究比较个体对AV和SAV的态度，以认识到公众倾向于SAV的障碍。为此，本研究提出了一个基于行为心理学理论的建模框架，以解释个体对拥有AV而不是使用SAV的偏好，该框架建立了一个潜在（主观）心理测量构建，并包括三组解释变量构建，包括：(i) 对利益搜索的渴望，即外在动机体现在实用主义信念中；(ii) 寻求快乐和享受的倾向，即内在动机体现在享乐主义信念中；(iii) 对三个配置的态度。",
