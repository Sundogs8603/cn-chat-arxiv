    "translated_abstract": "在不断变化的交通环境中优化交通动力学非常重要，特别是在自动驾驶车辆（AVs）与人驾驶车辆并存的情况下。本文提出了一种使用近端策略优化（PPO）强化学习算法来优化AVs选择的新方法。我们通过学习一种策略来最小化交通阻塞（即最小化横过米兰的环形道的时间）并减少污染。通过经验分析，我们证明了我们的方法可以减少时间和污染水平。此外，我们使用先进的驾驶舱定性评估了学到的策略，以评估其在接近真实世界条件下的性能。为了评估策略的实用性和可接受性，我们通过模拟器进行了人类参与者的评估，重点关注交通平稳性和安全感等一系列指标。总的来说，我们的研究结果表明，人驾驶车辆的感知和行车平滑性方面，我们的方法非常实用。",
