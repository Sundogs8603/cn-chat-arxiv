    "translated_abstract": "植物疾病对食品安全和农业可持续性仍然是一个重大威胁。快速和早期识别这些疾病已成为一个重要关注点，这推动了几项研究依赖于全球数字化的增长和基于深度学习的计算机视觉的最新进展。事实上，基于深度卷积神经网络的植物疾病分类已经展现出了令人印象深刻的性能。然而，由于对它们的鲁棒性、透明性以及与人工专家对照相比缺乏解释性的担忧，这些方法尚未全球采用。已经提出了一些基于显著性的方法，将网络输出与输入像素的扰动相关联，以提供对这些算法的洞察。然而，它们对人类用户来说并不容易理解和直观，并且受到偏见的威胁。在这项工作中，我们使用了一种名为Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV)的方法，来改变这种情况。",
