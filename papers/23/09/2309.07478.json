    "abstract": "This paper proposes a direct text to speech translation system using discrete acoustic units. This framework employs text in different source languages as input to generate speech in the target language without the need for text transcriptions in this language. Motivated by the success of acoustic units in previous works for direct speech to speech translation systems, we use the same pipeline to extract the acoustic units using a speech encoder combined with a clustering algorithm. Once units are obtained, an encoder-decoder architecture is trained to predict them. Then a vocoder generates speech from units. Our approach for direct text to speech translation was tested on the new CVSS corpus with two different text mBART models employed as initialisation. The systems presented report competitive performance for most of the language pairs evaluated. Besides, results show a remarkable improvement when initialising our proposed architecture with a model pre-trained with more languages.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种使用离散声学单元的直接文本到语音翻译系统。该框架使用不同源语言的文本作为输入，在不需要该语言的文本转录的情况下生成目标语言的语音。受到以前直接语音到语音翻译系统中声学单元的成功启发，我们使用相同的流水线通过结合语音编码器和聚类算法提取声学单元。一旦获得单元，就会训练一个编码器-解码器架构来预测它们。然后，一个声码器从单元生成语音。我们的直接文本到语音翻译方法在使用两个不同的文本mBART模型作为初始化的新CVSS语料库上进行了测试。所提出的系统在大多数评估的语言对上表现出竞争性能。此外，结果表明，当使用更多语言预训练模型来初始化我们提出的架构时，有显着的改进。",
