    "translated_abstract": "点击率（CTR）预测是在线广告和推荐系统中的关键任务，准确的预测对于用户定位和个性化推荐至关重要。最近的一些前沿方法主要关注复杂的隐式和显式特征交互。然而，这些方法忽视了由混淆因子或选择偏差引起的误关联问题。这个问题在这些交互的复杂性和冗余性下变得更加严重。我们提出了一种CTR预测框架，称为REFORM，在多级特征交互中移除了误关联。所提出的REFORM框架通过两个流式叠加的循环结构利用了大量的多级高阶特征表示，并消除了误关联。该框架有两个关键组成部分：I. 多级叠加循环（MSR）结构使模型能够高效地捕捉到来自特征空间的多样非线性交互。",
