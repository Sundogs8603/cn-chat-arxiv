    "translated_abstract": "零样本神经架构搜索（NAS）方法提出了一种新颖的无需训练的度量标准，称为零样本代理，以大幅减少与传统基于训练的NAS相比的搜索时间。尽管在图像分类上取得了成功，但对于语义分割和目标检测等复杂视觉任务，零样本代理的有效性很少得到评估。此外，现有的零样本代理被证明对特定模型特征具有偏向性，限制了它们的广泛应用。在本文中，我们通过实证研究零样本代理ZiCo在多个视觉任务上的偏差，发现ZiCo对于更瘦更深的网络有偏差，导致了次优的架构。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为ZiCo-BC的对ZiCo进行偏差修正的新方法。我们在各种视觉任务（图像分类、目标检测和语义分割）上进行了大量实验，结果表明我们的方法可以成功搜索出优化的架构。",
