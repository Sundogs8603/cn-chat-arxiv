    "translated_abstract": "听觉空间注意力检测（ASAD）旨在利用EEG在多人演讲者环境中解码被注意的空间位置。ASAD方法受到大脑皮层神经元在处理听觉空间注意力时的侧化启发，并在神经记录的听觉注意力解码（AAD）任务中显示出有希望的性能。在以往的ASAD方法中，尚未充分利用EEG电极的空间分布，这可能限制了这些方法的性能。在本研究中，通过将原始EEG信道转换为二维空间拓扑图，将EEG数据转换为包含时空信息的三维排列。然后使用三维深度卷积神经网络（DenseNet-3D）来提取所关注位置的神经表征的时空特征。结果表明，所提出的方法比传统方法实现了更高的解码精度。",
