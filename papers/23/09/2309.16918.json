    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）已经在各种实际应用中证明了其有效性，但其基本机制仍然是一个谜。为了解决这个挑战并实现可靠的决策，近年来提出了许多GNN解释器。然而，这些方法常常面临一些限制，包括对特定实例的依赖性，对未见过的图的一般性不足，可能产生无效的解释以及生成过程中产生的不充分的保真度。为了克服这些限制，本文将辅助分类器生成对抗网络（ACGAN）引入到GNN解释领域，并提出了一种新的GNN解释器ACGAN-GNNExplainer。我们的方法利用生成器为原始输入图生成解释，并运用鉴别器来监督生成过程，确保解释的保真度并提高准确性。实验评估分别在合成数据集和真实世界的图数据集上进行。",
