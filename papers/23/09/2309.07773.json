    "abstract": "This paper presents an empirical investigation of the extent to which spoken Humanoid Embodied Conversational Agents (HECAs) can foster usability in mobile serious game (MSG) applications. The aim of the research is to assess the impact of multiple agents and illusion of humanness on the quality of the interaction. The experiment investigates two styles of agent presentation: an agent of high human-likeness (HECA) and an agent of low human-likeness (text). The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether and how agents of high humanlikeness can evoke the illusion of humanness and affect usability. Agents of high human-likeness were designed by following the ECA design model that is a proposed guide for ECA development. The results of the experiment with 90 participants show that users prefer to interact with the HECAs. The difference between the two versions is statistically significant with a large effect size (d=1.01), with many of the participants justifying their choice by saying",

    "translated_abstract": "本文对移动严肃游戏应用中口语化人形机器人（HECA）对可用性的影响进行了实证调查。研究旨在评估多个机器人和人类交互幻觉对交互质量的影响。实验研究了两种机器人呈现方式：高人类相似度的机器人（HECA）和低人类相似度的机器人（文本）。实验的目的是评估高人类相似度机器人是否能够引发人类幻觉并影响可用性。高人类相似度机器人是根据ECA设计模型进行设计的，该模型是一种ECA开发的指导方针。实验结果显示，90位参与者更喜欢与HECA进行交互。两个版本之间的差异在统计学上具有显著性，效应大小较大（d=1.01），许多参与者通过解释选择来证明他们的选择。",
