    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了饲料成本的随机性对以动物为基础的商品的影响，特别关注水产养殖。具体而言，我们使用大豆期货来推断鲑鱼饲料的随机行为，我们假设其遵循Schwartz-2因子模型。我们比较了以确定性或随机饲料成本（即包括饲料成本风险）做出收获鲑鱼的决策规则。我们确定了考虑随机饲料成本时会有明显改善的情况，也有确定性饲料成本足够好的情况。然而，在所有这些情况下，新推导出的规则均显示出优越的性能，而附加的计算成本几乎可以忽略不计。从方法论上来说，我们展示了如何利用深度神经网络来推断决策边界，以确定收获或延续，改进了更传统的回归和曲线拟合方法。为了实现这一目标，我们使用了",
