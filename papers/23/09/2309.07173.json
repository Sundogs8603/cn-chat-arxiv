    "translated_abstract": "智能冰云感知（SMICES）是一个小卫星概念，其中主雷达根据前瞻辐射计收集的信息智能地针对冰风暴目标。准确识别雷达计收集的八个波段的云暴类型对于智能目标选择非常关键。感兴趣的云暴类型包括：晴空、薄雨层云、层云、多雨顶和对流核心。我们描述了利用机器学习和地球大气数字孪生技术进行这种分类器推导的多步骤过程。首先，使用名为天气研究预报（WRF）的地球大气数字孪生生成模拟的前瞻辐射计数据以及更深层的“科学”隐藏变量。数据集模拟了加勒比地区的热带地区和美国大西洋沿岸的非热带地区。人类专家利用科学隐藏变量上的K均值聚类生成数据的自动标记-将每个数据映射到相应的云暴类型。",
