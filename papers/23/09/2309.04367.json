    "translated_abstract": "确定由程序生成器生成的关卡的可完成性是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为这可能涉及使用求解器代理来分析和解决关卡，而这通常需要大量的时间。尽管主动学习已经成功地应用于自然语言处理、图像和语音识别以及计算机视觉领域，但在游戏评估中，它还没有被广泛采用，尤其是在标记数据有限或昂贵的情况下。在本文中，我们提出了使用主动学习来学习关卡可完成性分类。通过主动学习的方法，我们训练深度学习模型来对Super Mario Bros.、Kid Icarus和一个类似Zelda的游戏中生成的关卡进行可完成性分类。我们将使用主动学习方法标记关卡与使用随机查询标记关卡进行了比较。我们的结果表明，使用主动学习方法来标记关卡可以获得更好的分类器性能，而查询方法相同。",
