    "translated_abstract": "由于加密货币交易主体的伪匿名性质，加密货币往往比传统金融资产更容易受到非法活动的影响。理想的检测模型应该满足早期检测、良好可解释性和适用于各种非法活动的三个关键属性。然而，现有的解决方案无法满足所有这些要求，因为它们大多依赖于深度学习而缺乏可解释性，并且只适用于特定非法类型的回顾性分析。为了解决所有这些挑战，我们提出了一种用于比特币 (BTC) 的早期恶意检测的意图监控系统，其中某个地址的链上记录数据比其他加密货币平台更稀缺。我们首先使用基于决策树的特征选择和补充（DT-SC）来定义资产转移路径，为不同的恶意类型构建不同的特征集。然后，通过状态/行动提案模块（S/A-PM）获取可能的状态和行动，进一步发现恶意意图。",
