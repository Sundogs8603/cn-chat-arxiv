Notably, the detection method was trained using a label-only augmentation scheme; our results indicate that this form of augmentation outperforms traditional data augmentation and produces highly sample efficient estimators. We train a generic U-Net-based architecture under a curriculum consisting of two phases: initially relaxing the landmarking task by enlarging the label points to regions, then gradually eroding these label regions back to the base task. We measure the benefits of this approach on six datasets of radiographs with gold-standard expert annotations.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文报道了一种用于预测髋关节X射线图像中临床标记点的自动化医学标记点检测方法的实证性能。值得注意的是，该检测方法是使用仅标签增强方案进行训练的；我们的结果表明，这种增强形式优于传统的数据增强，并且产生高效的样本估计器。我们使用基于通用U-Net架构的课程训练，该训练包括两个阶段：首先通过将标记点扩大到区域来放松标记任务，然后逐渐将这些标签区域回归到基本任务。我们在含有黄金标准专家注释的六个放射图像数据集上评估了这种方法的优势。",
