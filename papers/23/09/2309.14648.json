Despite having broad applications, non-asymptotic estimation error bounds in the stochastic setting are limited. This paper provides such a non-asymptotic bound on the diameter of the uncertainty sets generated by set membership estimation on linear dynamical systems under bounded, i.i.d. disturbances. Further, this result is applied to robust adaptive model predictive control with uncertainty sets updated by set membership. We numerically demonstrate the performance of the robust adaptive controller, which rapidly approaches the performance of the offline optimal model predictive controller, in comparison with the control design based on least square estimation's confidence regions.",

    "translated_abstract": "集合成员身份估计广泛应用于需要对模型不确定性集合具有鲁棒性的自适应/基于学习的控制算法，例如在线鲁棒稳定控制和鲁棒自适应模型预测控制。尽管具有广泛的应用，但随机环境下的非渐近估计误差界限有限。本文在有界、独立同分布干扰下提供了线性动态系统中由集合成员身份估计产生的不确定性集合直径的非渐近界限。此外，将该结果应用于由集合成员身份更新的鲁棒自适应模型预测控制。通过数值实验证明了鲁棒自适应控制器的性能，该控制器与离线最优模型预测控制器的性能快速接近，相对于基于最小二乘估计置信区域的控制设计。",
