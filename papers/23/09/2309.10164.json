    "translated_abstract": "在大型机器人群体中实现共同的全局目标的协作是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为机器人的感知和通信能力有限。机器人必须执行感知-动作-通信（PAC）循环-它们感知局部环境，与其他机器人通信，并实时采取行动。分散的PAC系统面临的一个基本挑战是决定与相邻机器人通信的信息以及如何在利用邻居共享的信息的同时采取行动。最近，使用图神经网络（GNNs）来解决这个问题已经取得了一些进展，比如在群集和覆盖控制等应用中。虽然在概念上，GNN策略是完全分散的，但评估和部署这样的策略主要仍然是集中式的或具有限制性的分散式。此外，现有的框架假设感知和动作推理的顺序执行，这在现实世界的应用中非常限制性。",
