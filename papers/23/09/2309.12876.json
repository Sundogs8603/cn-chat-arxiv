    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel one-stage end-to-end detector specifically designed to detect small lesions in medical images. Precise localization of small lesions presents challenges due to their appearance and the diverse contextual backgrounds in which they are found. To address this, our approach introduces a new type of pixel-based anchor that dynamically moves towards the targeted lesion for detection. We refer to this new architecture as GravityNet, and the novel anchors as gravity points since they appear to be \"attracted\" by the lesions. We conducted experiments on two well-established medical problems involving small lesions to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach: microcalcifications detection in digital mammograms and microaneurysms detection in digital fundus images. Our method demonstrates promising results in effectively detecting small lesions in these medical imaging tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新颖的一阶段端到端检测器，专门用于检测医学图像中的小病灶。由于小病灶的外观和多样性的背景环境，精确定位小病灶存在一定的挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们的方法引入了一种新型的基于像素的锚点，它会动态地靠近目标病灶进行检测。我们将这种新的架构称为GravityNet，将这些新型锚点称为重力点，因为它们似乎被病灶所“吸引”。我们在两个已经成熟的医学问题上进行了实验，这两个问题分别涉及数字乳房X线照片中的微钙化检测和数字眼底图像中微动脉瘤的检测。我们的方法在这些医学图像任务中有效地检测小病灶，展现出了有希望的结果。",
