    "abstract": "Recently, several studies have reported on the fine-tuning of foundation models for image-text modeling in the field of medicine, utilizing images from online data sources such as Twitter and PubMed. Foundation models are large, deep artificial neural networks capable of learning the context of a specific domain through training on exceptionally extensive datasets. Through validation, we have observed that the representations generated by such models exhibit inferior performance in retrieval tasks within digital pathology when compared to those generated by significantly smaller, conventional deep networks.",
