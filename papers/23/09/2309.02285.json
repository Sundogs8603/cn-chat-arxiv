    "abstract": "Speech conveys more information than text, as the same word can be uttered in various voices to convey diverse information. Compared to traditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods relying on speech prompts (reference speech) for voice variability, using text prompts (descriptions) is more user-friendly since speech prompts can be hard to find or may not exist at all. TTS approaches based on the text prompt face two main challenges: 1) the one-to-many problem, where not all details about voice variability can be described in the text prompt, and 2) the limited availability of text prompt datasets, where vendors and large cost of data labeling are required to write text prompts for speech. In this work, we introduce PromptTTS 2 to address these challenges with a variation network to provide variability information of voice not captured by text prompts, and a prompt generation pipeline to utilize the large language models (LLM) to compose high quality text prompts.

    "translated_abstract": "语音传达的信息比文字更丰富，因为相同的词可以以不同的声音表达不同的信息。与依赖语音提示（参考语音）来实现声音可变性的传统文本转语音（TTS）方法相比，使用文本提示（描述）更加用户友好，因为语音提示可能难以找到或根本不存在。基于文本提示的TTS方法面临两个主要挑战：1）一对多问题，即文本提示无法描述声音可变性的所有细节；2）文本提示数据集的有限可用性，需要供应商和大量数据标注成本来编写语音的文本提示。在这项工作中，我们介绍了PromptTTS 2来解决这些挑战，该系统使用变化网络提供文本提示无法捕捉的声音可变性信息，并使用大型语言模型（LLM）来生成高质量的文本提示。",
