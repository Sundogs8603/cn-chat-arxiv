    "abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of connecting people online to help them find support with their day-to-day problems. We make use of declarative norms for mediating online interactions, and we specifically focus on the issue of leveraging diversity when connecting people. We run pilots at different university sites, and the results show relative success in the diversity of the selected profiles, backed by high user satisfaction.",
