    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络（DNN）在几个具有挑战性的领域中取得了巨大进步。最近的研究表明，它们容易做出过于自信的预测。这极大地降低了模型预测的整体可信度，尤其是在安全关键应用中。改进模型校准的早期工作采用了后处理技术，这些技术依赖于有限的参数，并且需要一个保留数据集。一些最近的训练时校准方法，在涉及所有模型参数的情况下，可以胜过后处理方法。为此，我们提出了一种新的训练时校准方法，它具有一个简单的、即插即用的辅助损失，称为多类别对预测均值置信度和确定性进行对齐（MACC）。它基于这样一个观察结果：模型的失校准直接与其确定性相关，因此均值置信度和确定性之间的较大差距意味着在分布内和分布外都存在很差的校准。",
