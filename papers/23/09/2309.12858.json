    "translated_abstract": "最近顺序推荐（SRS）已成为许多应用的技术基础，其目标是基于用户的历史交互来推荐下一个项目。然而，顺序推荐经常面临数据稀疏的问题，这在推荐系统中普遍存在。此外，大多数用户只与少数项目进行交互，但现有的SRS模型通常性能不佳。这个问题被称为长尾用户问题，仍待解决。数据增强是缓解这两个问题的一种方法，但它们通常需要制造训练策略或受到质量不佳的生成交互的限制。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种用于顺序推荐的扩散增强（DiffuASR），以实现更高质量的生成。DiffuASR通过扩散产生的增强数据集可以直接用于训练顺序推荐模型，免去了复杂的训练过程。",
