    "abstract": "Though Vaccines are instrumental in global health, mitigating infectious diseases and pandemic outbreaks, they can occasionally lead to adverse events (AEs). Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in effectively identifying and cataloging AEs within clinical reports. Utilizing data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from 1990 to 2016, this study particularly focuses on AEs to evaluate LLMs' capability for AE extraction. A variety of prevalent LLMs, including GPT-2, GPT-3 variants, GPT-4, and Llama 2, were evaluated using Influenza vaccine as a use case. The fine-tuned GPT 3.5 model (AE-GPT) stood out with a 0.704 averaged micro F1 score for strict match and 0.816 for relaxed match. The encouraging performance of the AE-GPT underscores LLMs' potential in processing medical data, indicating a significant stride towards advanced AE detection, thus presumably generalizable to other AE extraction tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管疫苗在全球健康、减轻传染病和大流行爆发方面起着重要作用，但偶尔也会导致不良事件（AEs）。近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）在有效识别和编目临床报告中的不良事件方面显示出潜力。本研究利用1990年至2016年来自疫苗不良事件报告系统（VAERS）的数据，特别关注评估LLMs在不良事件提取方面的能力。使用流感疫苗作为使用案例，评估了各种主流的LLMs，包括GPT-2、GPT-3变体、GPT-4和Llama 2。经过微调的GPT 3.5模型（AE-GPT）在严格匹配方面的平均微 F1 分数为0.704，灵活匹配方面为0.816。AE-GPT的令人鼓舞的表现突显了LLMs在处理医学数据方面的潜力，表明在先进的AE检测方面迈出了重要的一步，因此可以推广到其他AE提取任务。",
