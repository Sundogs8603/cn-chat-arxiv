    "translated_abstract": "系统一般化是智能的关键方面，它指的是通过结合已知的子任务和概念来推广到新任务的能力。已经显示影响系统一般化的一个关键因素是训练数据的多样性。然而，多样性可以以多种方式定义，因为数据具有许多变化因素。对于不同方面的数据多样性如何影响系统一般化的更细致的理解尚缺乏。我们在视觉问答（VQA）问题中提供了新的证据，揭示了简单任务的多样性（即由几个子任务和概念组成的任务）在实现系统一般化中的关键作用。这意味着收集大量和多样化的复杂任务可能并非必要，这可能成本高昂。我们证明了这个结果与训练和测试数据之间的相似性无关，并适用于众所周知的神经网络家族。",
