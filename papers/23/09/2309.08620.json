We propose a repetitive deterministic domain with median ergodicity for resampling and have achieved the lowest variances compared to the other resampling methods. As the size of the deterministic domain $M\\ll N$ (the size of population), given a feasible size of particles, our algorithm is faster than the state of the art, which is verified by theoretical deduction and experiments of a hidden Markov model in both the linear and non-linear cases.",
