Our framework hinges on a special organisation of knowledge base that enables: 1. its efficient population from natural language texts using semi-automated procedures based on Large Language Models, 2. the bumpless generation of temporal parallel plans for multi-robot systems through a sequence of transformations, 3. the automated translation of the plan into an executable formalism (the behaviour trees). The framework is supported by a set of open source tools and is shown on a realistic application.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于Prolog语言的面向机器人的知识管理系统。我们的框架依赖于一种特殊的知识库组织形式，实现了以下功能：1.利用大型语言模型进行自动化的自然语言文本知识库填充；2.通过一系列转换生成多机器人系统的连续并行计划；3.将计划自动转化为可执行形式（行为树）。该框架支持一系列开源工具，并在一个现实应用中进行了验证。",
