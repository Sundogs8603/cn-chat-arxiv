Existing RST parsing pipelines construct rhetorical structures without the knowledge of document-level content structures, which causes relatively low performance when predicting the discourse relations for large text spans. Recognizing the value of high-level content-related information in facilitating discourse relation recognition, we propose a novel pipeline for RST-DP that incorporates structure-aware news content sentence representations derived from the task of News Discourse Profiling. By incorporating only a few additional layers, this enhanced pipeline exhibits promising performance across various RST parsing metrics.",

    "translated_abstract": "修辞结构理论(RST)基于话语解析探索了从从子句、句子到大文本范围如何组成一个整体话语，并以分层树的形式呈现修辞结构。现有的RST解析流水线在构建修辞结构时缺乏对文档级内容结构的了解，导致在预测大文本范围的话语关系时性能相对较低。基于意识到高级内容相关信息在促进话语关系识别方面的价值，我们提出了一种新的RST-DP流水线，该流水线融入了从新闻话语建模任务中得出的结构感知的新闻内容句子表示。通过仅增加几个额外的层次，这个增强的流水线在各种RST解析指标上展现了有希望的性能。",
