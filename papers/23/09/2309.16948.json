    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型是强大的生成模型，它使用随机过程将噪声映射到数据。然而，对于许多应用，如图像编辑，模型的输入不是随机噪声的分布。因此，扩散模型必须依赖于繁琐的方法，如引导或投影采样，以在生成过程中加入这些信息。在我们的工作中，我们提出了去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs），这是一种基于扩散桥的范例，扩散桥是一族过程，其在给定的端点下插值两个配对分布。我们的方法通过学习扩散桥的分数，基于学习到的分数求解一个（随机的）微分方程，从一个端点分布映射到另一个端点分布。我们的方法自然地统一了几类生成模型，如基于分数的扩散模型和OT-Flow-Matching，使我们能够将现有的设计和架构选择适应到更通用的模型中。",
