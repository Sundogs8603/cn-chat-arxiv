    "abstract": "We propose a simple, efficient, and accurate method for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data for trained neural networks, a potential first step in methods for OOD generalization. We propose a novel descriptor, HAct activation histograms, for OOD detection, that is, probability distributions (approximated by histograms) of output values of neural network layers under the influence of incoming data. We demonstrate that HAct is significantly more accurate than state-of-the-art on multiple OOD image classification benchmarks. For instance, our approach achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of 95% with only 0.05% false-positives using Resnet-50 on standard OOD benchmarks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art by 20.66% in the false positive rate (at the same TPR of 95%). The low computational complexity and the ease of implementation make HAct suitable for online implementation in monitoring deployed neural networks in practice at scale.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种简单、高效、准确的方法，用于检测经过训练的神经网络对于数据集外（OOD）数据的检测，这是用于OOD泛化方法的潜在第一步。我们提出了一种新颖的描述符，即HAct激活直方图，用于OOD检测，即通过直方图来近似表示神经网络层输出值的概率分布。我们证明HAct在多种OOD图像分类基准测试上比最先进的方法更准确。例如，在标准的OOD基准测试上，我们的方法使用Resnet-50实现了95%的真正例率（TPR），而只有0.05%的误报率，使得其在误报率上相较于之前最先进的方法提高了20.66%（在相同的95%TPR下）。低计算复杂度和易于实现使得HAct适合大规模实践中在线监测部署的神经网络。",
