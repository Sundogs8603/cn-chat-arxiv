    "abstract": "Adversarial examples, deliberately crafted using small perturbations to fool deep neural networks, were first studied in image processing and more recently in NLP. While approaches to detecting adversarial examples in NLP have largely relied on search over input perturbations, image processing has seen a range of techniques that aim to characterise adversarial subspaces over the learned representations.  In this paper, we adapt two such approaches to NLP, one based on nearest neighbors and influence functions and one on Mahalanobis distances. The former in particular produces a state-of-the-art detector when compared against several strong baselines; moreover, the novel use of influence functions provides insight into how the nature of adversarial example subspaces in NLP relate to those in image processing, and also how they differ depending on the kind of NLP task.",

    "translated_abstract": "对抗样本是通过微小扰动来欺骗深度神经网络的，起初在图像处理领域进行研究，最近在自然语言处理领域也开始关注。尽管在自然语言处理中检测对抗样本的方法主要依赖于输入扰动的搜索，但图像处理领域已经发展出一系列技术来表征学习表示中的对抗子空间。本文将这两种方法应用于自然语言处理，一种基于最近邻和影响函数，一种基于马氏距离。特别是前者相比几个强基准产生了最先进的检测器；此外，对影响函数的新颖使用揭示了自然语言处理中的对抗样本子空间与图像处理中的子空间的关系，并展示了它们根据不同自然语言处理任务的差异。",
