    "translated_abstract": "高动态范围（HDR）内容创建已成为现代媒体和娱乐行业、游戏和增强/虚拟现实行业的重要议题。许多方法已被提出，用于重建输入低动态范围（LDR）图像/视频的HDR对应物，给定单个曝光或多曝光LDR。目前的方法主要关注重建的结构相似性和像素精确性的保持。然而，这些传统方法并不强调在媒体、娱乐和游戏方面保持图像的艺术意图，这是人类视觉感知中的一个重要元素。在本文中，我们试图研究和填补这一空白。我们提出了一种基于卷积神经网络的架构，称为ArtHDR-Net，它使用多曝光LDR特征作为输入。实验结果表明，ArtHDR-Net在HDR-VDP-2得分方面取得了最先进的性能（即平均意见得分indec）",

It not only focuses on preserving the structural similarity and pixel-wise accuracy of the reconstruction, but also emphasizes the preservation of the artistic intent of the images to align with human visual perception. Experimental results demonstrate that ArtHDR-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in HDR content creation."
