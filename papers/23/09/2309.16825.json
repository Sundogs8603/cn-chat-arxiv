    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）被越来越认为是克服临床环境中数据孤立问题的关键方法。该研究在临床应用的FL研究中做出了三个重要方面的贡献。首先，提出了将FENDA方法（Kim等人，2016）扩展到FL的方法。在FLamby基准（du Terrail等人，2022a）和GEMINI数据集（Verma等人，2017）上进行的实验表明，该方法对异构临床数据具有鲁棒性，并且通常优于现有的全局和个性化FL技术。此外，实验结果在原有的FLamby基准上表示出实质性的改进，并扩展了这些基准以包括个性化FL方法的评估。最后，我们提倡建立一个全面的FL检查点和评估框架，以更好地反映实际环境并提供",
