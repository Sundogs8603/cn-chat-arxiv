    "abstract": "With recent rapid growth of large language models (LLMs), discrete speech tokenization has played an important role for injecting speech into LLMs. However, this discretization gives rise to a loss of information, consequently impairing overall performance. To improve the performance of these discrete speech tokens, we present RepCodec, a novel speech representation codec for semantic speech tokenization. In contrast to audio codecs which reconstruct the raw audio, RepCodec learns a vector quantization codebook through reconstructing speech representations from speech encoders like HuBERT or data2vec. Together, the speech encoder, the codec encoder and the vector quantization codebook form a pipeline for converting speech waveforms into semantic tokens. The extensive experiments illustrate that RepCodec, by virtue of its enhanced information retention capacity, significantly outperforms the widely used k-means clustering approach in both speech understanding and generation.

    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速增长，离散语音标记在将语音注入LLMs中发挥了重要作用。然而，这种离散化导致了信息的丢失，从而损害了整体性能。为了提高这些离散语音标记的性能，我们提出了RepCodec，一种用于语义语音标记的新型语音表示编码器。与重新构建原始音频的音频编解码器不同，RepCodec通过从语音编码器（如HuBERT或data2vec）重构语音表示来学习矢量量化码书。语音编码器、编解码器和矢量量化码书共同构成一个将语音波形转换为语义标记的流水线。广泛的实验证明，由于其增强的信息保留能力，RepCodec在语音理解和生成方面显著优于广泛使用的k-means聚类方法。",
