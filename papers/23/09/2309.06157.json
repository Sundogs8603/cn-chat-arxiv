    "abstract": "In this paper, a Robust Multi-branch Deep learning-based system for remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and condition operations (CO) identification of rotating machines is proposed. In particular, the proposed system comprises main components: (1) an LSTM-Autoencoder to denoise the vibration data; (2) a feature extraction to generate time-domain, frequency-domain, and time-frequency based features from the denoised data; (3) a novel and robust multi-branch deep learning network architecture to exploit the multiple features. The performance of our proposed system was evaluated and compared to the state-of-the-art systems on two benchmark datasets of XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA. The experimental results prove that our proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems and presents potential for real-life applications on bearing machines.",
