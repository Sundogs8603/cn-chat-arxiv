    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）目前由深度学习（DL）等机器学习（ML）方法推动，这些方法加速了在许多原本被认为超出AI范围的任务上的进展。这些ML方法通常需要大量计算资源、能源消耗大，并导致大量的碳排放，这是人为气候变化的一个已知驱动因素。此外，ML系统运行的平台与环境影响有关，包括碳排放之外的其他方面。工业界和ML社区广泛推崇的提高ML系统在计算和能源消耗方面的效率来改善环境可持续性的解决方案，我们认为仅仅依靠效率还不足以使ML作为一种环境可持续的技术。我们通过提出三个高层次的差异来阐述考虑众多变量对ML环境可持续性影响时，仅依靠效率是不够的。",
