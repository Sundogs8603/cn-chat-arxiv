    "translated_abstract": "与阅读相同的指令相比，会话助手在执行复杂指令时往往会面临注意力和记忆力短缺的问题。因此，当会话助手引导用户完成复杂任务的步骤时，需要将任务结构化为合适长度和复杂度的可管理信息。本文针对食谱领域，将结构化指令转化为会话式指令。我们根据会话场景注释了指令的结构，以了解该场景中的期望行为。为了计算上述会话步骤的特征，我们测试了各种基于Transformer的架构，结果显示基于标记的方法效果最好。进一步的用户研究表明，用户倾向于接受长度和复杂度适中的步骤，并且提出的方法可以提高原始基于网页的指令的效果。",

Experimental results show that a token-based Transformer model performs the best in computing the characteristics of conversational steps, and user studies demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the effectiveness of original instructions."
