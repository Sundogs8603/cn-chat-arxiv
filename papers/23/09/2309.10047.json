    "translated_abstract": "聚类技术是数据挖掘、机器学习和模式识别的关键驱动力。其中最流行的聚类算法之一是DBSCAN，由于其高准确性和噪声容忍度。许多优秀的算法，如DBSCAN，其输入参数难以估计。因此，找到这些参数是一个耗时的过程。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的聚类算法\"Bacteria-Farm\"，它在性能和寻找聚类的最优参数之间取得了平衡。Bacteria-Farm算法受到实验室封闭饲养场中细菌生长的启发 - 它们的能力消耗食物并生长 - 这与聚类算法中期望的理想聚类生长方式非常相似。此外，该算法具有模块化设计，允许针对特定任务/数据分布的版本创建算法。与其他聚类算法相比，我们的算法还提供了指定噪声规范的功能。",
