    "translated_abstract": "电池在深度去碳化的未来中是至关重要的组成部分。理解电池性能和“寿命”与设计和使用的关系对于加快采用电池技术至关重要。在历史上，电池健康状态（SOH）被总结为一个参数，即电池容量相对于初始状态的比例。然而，更实用的方法是综合描述其状态和复杂性，使用一组相关的描述符，包括容量、能量、离子和电子阻抗、开路电压和微观结构度量。事实上，准确预测电池使用过程中一系列性能是电池科学的“圣杯”；它可以为更好地设计电池提供前所未有的见解，并降低满足CO2减排目标所必需的能源储存投资的风险。在这项工作中，我们通过Transformer模型迈出了这个方向的第一步。",
