    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了MatSciML，这是一个针对具有周期性晶体结构的固态材料建模的机器学习基准。将机器学习方法应用于固态材料是一个新兴领域，由于所使用的数据集的种类繁多，导致领域内存在着较大的分散性。这种分散性使得比较不同方法的性能和泛化能力变得困难，从而阻碍了该领域的整体研究进展。在开源数据集的基础上，包括OpenCatalyst、OQMD、NOMAD、Carolina材料数据库和Materials Project等大规模数据集，MatSciML基准为模型的训练和评估提供了多样化的材料系统和属性数据，包括模拟能量、原子力、材料能隙以及通过空间群进行晶体对称性的分类数据。",
