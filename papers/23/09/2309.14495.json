Cosine dissimilarity is frequently used with datasets containing token frequencies, and angular Minkowski $p$-distance may potentially be an even better choice for certain tasks. In a case study based on the 20-newsgroups dataset, we evaluate clasification performance for classical weighted nearest neighbours, as well as fuzzy rough nearest neighbours. In addition, we analyse the relationship between the hyperparameter $p$, the dimensionality $m$ of the dataset, the number of neighbours $k$, the choice of weights and the choice of classifier. We conclude that it is possible to obtain substantially higher classification performance with angular Minkowski $p$-distance with suitable values for $p$ than with classical cosine dissimilarity.",
