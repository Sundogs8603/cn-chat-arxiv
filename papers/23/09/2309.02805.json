    "translated_abstract": "热力学状态方程（EOS）对许多行业以及学术界都至关重要。即使不考虑用于数据采集的昂贵而广泛的测量活动，EOS的开发仍是一个非常耗时的过程，通常仍然严重依赖专家知识和迭代微调。为了改进和加快EOS开发过程，我们引入了热力学信息的符号回归（TiSR），这是一个针对热力学EOS建模的符号回归工具。TiSR已经是一个功能强大的符号回归工具，已经在https://doi.org/10.1007/s10765-023-03197-z的研究中使用。它旨在将基于SR的方法与处理通常强烈分散的实验数据所需的扩展、不同的残差预处理和后处理选项以及考虑热力学EOS开发所需的其他特性相结合。尽管TiSR尚未准备好供最终用户使用，本文旨在报告其当前状态。",
