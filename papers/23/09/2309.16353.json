    "translated_abstract": "时间序列数据几乎在各个领域中都有所应用，从医学领域到制造业和无线通信。生成逼真且有用的样本和原型是一项基本的数据分析任务。本文中，我们研究了一种新的方法来为时间序列数据生成逼真且有用的样本和原型。我们的方法使用了一种新型的时间序列平均形式，即ShapeDTW Barycentric Average。因此，我们专注于使用一种新的方法准确生成时间序列原型。现有的时间序列原型化方法依赖于动态时间规整(DTW)相似性度量，如DTW Barycentering Average(DBA)和SoftDBA。这些方法在其原型中存在一个常见问题，即生成了不符合分布的人工制品。这主要是由于所使用的DTW变体及其无法检测邻域相似性，而只能检测绝对相似性所致。我们提出的方法ShapeDBA通过改进DTW变体解决了这个问题，",
