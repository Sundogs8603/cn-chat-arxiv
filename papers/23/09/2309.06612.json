    "translated_abstract": "最近，对多模态神经网络（MM-NN）的兴趣激增，这归功于它们有效处理和整合来自不同数据源的信息的能力。在MM-NN中，使用适当的单模态骨干和特定的融合网络从多个模态提取和融合特征。尽管这有助于增强多模态信息表达，但设计此类网络是劳动密集型的。它需要调整单模态骨干的架构参数，选择融合点，并选择融合的操作。此外，多模性人工智能正在成为物联网系统中的一种尖端选择，其中推断延迟和能量消耗是除准确性外的关键指标。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为Harmonic-NAS的框架，用于在资源受限设备上具有硬件感知的单模态骨干和多模态融合网络的联合优化。",
