    "abstract": "This paper explores the potential of constructing an AI spoken dialogue system that \"thinks how to respond\" and \"thinks how to speak\" simultaneously, which more closely aligns with the human speech production process compared to the current cascade pipeline of independent chatbot and Text-to-Speech (TTS) modules. We hypothesize that Large Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters possess significant speech understanding capabilities and can jointly model dialogue responses and linguistic features. We conduct two sets of experiments: 1) Prosodic structure prediction, a typical front-end task in TTS, demonstrating the speech understanding ability of LLMs, and 2) Further integrating dialogue response and a wide array of linguistic features using a unified encoding format. Our results indicate that the LLM-based approach is a promising direction for building unified spoken dialogue systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探索构建一个同时“思考如何回答”和“思考如何说话”的AI口语对话系统的潜力，这与当前独立的聊天机器人和文本转语音（TTS）模块的级联流程相比更贴近人类语音生成过程。我们假设具有数十亿参数的大型语言模型（LLMs）具备重要的语音理解能力，并可以同时对对话回应和语言特征进行联合建模。我们进行了两组实验：1）韵律结构预测，这是TTS中的典型前端任务，展示了LLMs的语音理解能力；2）进一步整合对话回应和各种语言特征，使用统一的编码格式。我们的结果表明，基于LLM的方法对于构建统一的口语对话系统是一个有前景的方向。",
