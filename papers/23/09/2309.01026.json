We propose rendering inputs of different modalities as textual descriptions and to utilize pre-trained LLMs to obtain their numerical representations by computing semantic embeddings. Once unified representations of all content items are obtained, the recommendation can be performed by computing an appropriate similarity metric between them without any additional learning. We demonstrate our approach on a synthetic multimodal nudging environment, where the inputs consist of tabular, textual, and visual data.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种利用生成型人工智能领域最新进展的方法，用于零样本推荐多模态非平稳内容。我们建议将不同模态的输入渲染为文本描述，并利用预训练的LLM计算语义嵌入获取它们的数值表示。一旦获得所有内容项的统一表示，可以通过计算适当的相似度度量来进行推荐，而无需进行额外的学习。我们在一个合成的多模态暗示环境中演示了我们的方法，其中输入包括表格、文本和视觉数据。",
