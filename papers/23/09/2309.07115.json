    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种方法，用于实现针对开放集音视频说话人验证的鲁棒多模态个人表示。距离度量学习（DML）方法通常在该问题领域占据主导地位，因为在新的和未见过的类上表现出很强的性能。在我们的工作中，我们探索了多任务学习技术，进一步提高了DML方法的性能，并展示了一个带有弱标签的辅助任务可以增加学习到的说话人表示的紧凑性。我们还将广义端到端损失（GE2E）扩展到多模态输入，并证明它可以在音视频空间中实现竞争性能。最后，我们在训练期间引入了一种非同步音视频采样随机策略，已经显示可以提高泛化能力。我们的网络在说话人验证方面达到了最先进的性能，报告了VoxCeleb1-O/E的三个官方试验列表上的0.244％，0.252％，0.441％的等误差率（EER）。",
