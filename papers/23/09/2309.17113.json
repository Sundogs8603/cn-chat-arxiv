    "translated_abstract": "现有的多关系图神经网络使用两种策略来确定信息相关的关系：要么将这个问题简化为低级权重学习，要么依赖于手工设计的关系依赖链，称为元路径。然而，前一种方法在存在大量关系的情况下（例如，知识图谱）面临挑战，而后一种方法需要大量领域专业知识来确定相关的元路径。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新方法来学习元路径和元路径图神经网络，这些网络基于少量有信息量的元路径具有高准确性。我们方法的关键要素是一个评分函数，用于衡量在元路径的增量构建中关系的潜在信息量。我们的实验评估表明，即使有大量关系，我们的方法仍能正确识别相关的元路径，并在合成和真实世界实验中明显优于现有的多关系GNNs。",
