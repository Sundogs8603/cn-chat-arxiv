    "translated_abstract": "结构学习问题是将由有向无环图（DAG）生成的数据正确地重构其弧的问题。在这种情况下，可微化方法使用连续松弛的非环性质对优化问题进行约束或规范化。评估图的非环性的计算成本与节点数量呈三次方关系，严重影响可扩展性。本文介绍了COSMO，一种无约束连续优化方案，用于非环结构学习。在我们的方法的核心，我们定义了一个可微近似的方向矩阵，其由一个优先向量参数化。与以前的工作不同，我们的参数化得到了一个平滑的方向矩阵和相应的非环邻接矩阵，而不需要在任何步骤中评估非环性。尽管没有显式约束，我们证明COSMO始终收敛到一个非环解。除了渐近快速外，我们的经验分析还表明COSMO与其他有约束方法相比具有更小的误差。",
