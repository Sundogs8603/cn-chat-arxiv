This approach is grounded in the hypothesis that laminar blood flow signifies normal function, while turbulent flow indicates pathology. The study explores two distinct methods for distinguishing chaotic from regular time series.

    "translated_abstract": "该论文探讨了区分正常和混乱时间序列的数学方法，特别是用于识别病理性物瘘。它提出了一种抗噪声方法，用于分类正常和病理性功能的物瘘的响应行。该方法基于以下假设：层流血液流动表示正常功能，而湍流流动表示病理性。该研究探讨了两种区分混乱和正常时间序列的不同方法。第一种方法涉及将时间序列映射到熵-复杂度平面上，然后与已建立的聚类进行比较。第二种方法是由作者引入的，它使用形式概念分析构建了一个概念-对象图。这两种方法在确定物瘘状态方面都表现出高效性。",
