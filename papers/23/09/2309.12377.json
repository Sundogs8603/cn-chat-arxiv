EVOO is a high-quality vegetable oil that has earned worldwide reputation for its numerous health benefits and excellent taste. Despite its outstanding quality, EVOO degrades over time owing to oxidation, which can affect both its health qualities and flavour. Therefore, it is highly relevant to quantify the effects of oxidation on EVOO and develop methods to assess it that can be easily implemented under field conditions, rather than in specialized laboratories.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究系统地调查了在加速储存条件下使用UV吸收和总荧光光谱对特级初榨橄榄油（EVOO）进行氧化研究。通过收集的大量数据，提出了一种基于机器学习应用于高度聚合数据的方法来监测油质量。尽管特级初榨橄榄油以其众多的健康益处和卓越的口味而享誉全球，但它随着时间的推移会发生降解，由于氧化作用，其健康品质和风味都可能受到影响。因此，量化氧化对特级初榨橄榄油的影响并开发易于在现场条件下实施而非专门实验室的评估方法非常重要。这项研究表明，荧光光谱具有监测氧化效果和评估特级初榨橄榄油质量的能力，即使数据高度聚合也可以实现。",
