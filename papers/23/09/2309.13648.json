    "translated_abstract": "我们首次深入地对去中心化交易所（DEX）交易成本进行了实证研究。我们使用Uniswap Labs界面上的USDC-ETH（5bps）和PEPE-ETH（30bps）池的报价价格，评估了在DEX上交易的效率。我们的主要工具是滑点——交易实际执行价格与报价价格之间的差异，我们将其分解为良性和对抗性组成部分。我们还提出了一种另类的量化和识别由于对抗性事务重新排序引起的滑点的方法，我们称之为重新排序滑点，它不需要报价价格或mempool数据来计算。我们发现交易成本的组成因交易特征而异。具体而言，对于小规模交换，gas成本占主导地位，而对于大规模交换，价格冲击和滑点占据了大部分。此外，当交易PEPE（一种流行的“迷因币”）时，对抗性滑点的概率也有所不同。",
