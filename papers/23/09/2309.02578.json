    "translated_abstract": "病理检测和准确定位能够实现对医学扫描（如胸部X射线）的自动解释，并提供高度可解释性，以支持放射科医生做出明智的决策。然而，标注病理范围的工作耗时，因此用于此目的的大型公共数据集很少。目前的方法因缺乏边界框监督而在性能上受到限制，因此使用弱监督目标检测从图像级别注释中学习病理的（粗略）定位。因此，我们提出了基于解剖学驱动的病理检测（ADPD），该方法将易于注释的解剖区域边界框作为病理的代理。我们研究了两种训练方法：使用解剖级别病理标签的有监督训练和使用图像级病理标签的多示例学习（MIL）。我们的结果显示，我们的解剖级别训练方法优于弱监督方法和完全监督方法。",
