    "translated_abstract": "本文在回答产品的主观归纳问题（SUBJPQA）的领域中提出了一个新任务。这类问题的答案是非唯一的，但可以从多个角度来解释。例如，对于“手机是否重”的答案有多种不同的观点。一个满意的答案应该能够总结这些来自多个来源的主观意见，并提供客观知识，比如手机的重量。这与传统的QA任务非常不同，传统QA任务中对于事实问题的答案是唯一的，并且可以从单个数据源中找到。为了解决这个新任务，我们提出了一个三步骤的方法。首先，我们从多个知识源中检索所有与答案相关的线索，包括事实和观点。还收集了隐含的常识事实来补充必要但缺失的背景信息。然后，我们通过交互式注意力来捕捉它们与问题的相关性。接下来，我们设计了一个基于强化学习的摘要生成器来聚合这些信息。",
