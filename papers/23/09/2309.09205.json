    "translated_abstract": "过程控制方案的设计对于减少制造系统中的变异性至关重要，以确保产品质量。以半导体制造为例，大量文献关注基于某些经过实验获得的过程模型（通常是线性模型）的控制优化。然而，在实际应用中，预定义的模型可能不准确，特别是对于复杂的制造系统。为了解决模型不准确的问题，我们提出了一种无模型强化学习（MFRL）方法，根据实时数据同时进行实验和优化控制。具体而言，我们设计了一种新颖的MFRL控制方案，通过使用贝叶斯推理来更新扰动的分布，以减少制造过程中的大幅度变化。结果显示，当过程模型未知时，所提出的MFRL控制器在非线性化学机械抛光（CMP）过程中表现良好。",
