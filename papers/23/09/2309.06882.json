    "translated_abstract": "产品映射的目标是确定两个不同电子商店中的两个列表是否描述相同的产品。然而，现有的匹配和非匹配产品对的数据集经常受到产品信息不完整或者只包含非常远的非匹配产品的问题。因此，尽管在这些数据集上训练的预测模型取得了良好的结果，但实际上它们无法区分非常相似但不匹配的产品对，因此无法使用。本文介绍了两个新的产品映射数据集：ProMapCz包含1495对捷克产品，ProMapEn包含1555对英文产品，这些产品对来自两个电子商店，包含了产品的图像和文字描述，包括规格，使它们成为最完整的产品映射数据集之一。此外，非匹配产品是通过两个阶段进行选择的。",
