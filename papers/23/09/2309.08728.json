    "translated_abstract": "可变形物体操作在机器人操纵中面临一系列独特挑战，如高自由度和自遮挡。而对于表现塑性行为的材料（如黏土或面团），其状态表示也很困难，因为它们在受力下会永久变形并不断改变形状。在本研究中，我们使用并行夹具进行机器人雕刻的任务来研究这些挑战。我们提出了一种系统，使用点云作为状态表示，并利用预训练的点云重构Transformer学习潜在的动力学模型，以预测材料在夹取行为下的变形。我们设计了一种新颖的动作采样算法，通过分析点云之间的几何差异进一步提高基于模型的规划器的效率。所有数据和实验均完全在真实世界中进行。我们的实验证明，所提出的系统能够成功捕捉到...",
