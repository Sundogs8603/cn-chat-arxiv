    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder affecting 50 million individuals worldwide and 1.2 million Americans. There exist millions of pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy, a condition in which seizures fail to come under control. The occurrence of seizures can result in physical injury, disorientation, unconsciousness, and additional symptoms that could impede children's ability to participate in everyday tasks. Predicting seizures can help parents and healthcare providers take precautions, prevent risky situations, and mentally prepare children to minimize anxiety and nervousness associated with the uncertainty of a seizure. This research proposes a novel and comprehensive framework to predict seizures in pediatric patients by evaluating machine learning algorithms on unimodal neuroimaging data consisting of electroencephalogram signals. The bandpass filtering and independent component analysis proved to be effective in reducing the noise and artifacts from the dataset. ",

    "translated_abstract": "癫痫是一种常见的神经系统疾病，全球有5000万人受到影响，美国有120万人受到影响。存在着大量儿童患者患有难治性癫痫，即癫痫发作无法得到控制。癫痫发作可能导致身体伤害、迷失方向、失去意识，以及其他可能妨碍儿童参与日常活动的症状。预测癫痫发作可以帮助家长和医护人员采取预防措施，避免危险情况，并让儿童在面对癫痫的不确定性时减少焦虑和紧张感。本研究提出了一种新颖而全面的框架，通过评估机器学习算法对以脑电图信号为基础的单模态神经影像数据进行癫痫预测。",
