    "translated_abstract": "在各种社会科学的实证研究中，常常涉及到具有内在排序的分类结果，比如主观幸福感的自我评估和健康领域的自我评估。尽管有序选择模型（如有序logit和有序probit）是分析这些结果的常用工具，但它们可能会强加参数限制和分布假设。本文介绍了一种新的估计器——有序相关森林，它可以自然地处理数据中的非线性，并且不假设特定的误差项分布。提出的估计器修改了标准随机森林的分裂准则，构建了一组森林，每个森林估计一个单一类别的条件概率。在“诚实”条件下，预测是一致的并且渐近正常的。由每个森林引发的权重被用来获取预测概率和协变量边际效应的标准误。来自合成数据的证据证明了有序相关森林的效果。",
