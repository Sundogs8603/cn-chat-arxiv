    "translated_abstract": "面向方面的情感分析（ABSA）旨在理解文本内容中特定要素的情感。它旨在分析用户生成的评论，确定a) 被评论的目标实体，b) 它所属的高级方面，c) 用于表达观点的情感词，d) 对目标和方面表达的情感。尽管各种基准数据集推动了ABSA的进展，但它们往往带来领域限制和数据粒度挑战。为了解决这些问题，我们介绍了OATS数据集，该数据集涵盖了三个全新的领域，并包含20,000个句子级四元组和13,000个评论级元组。我们的目标是填补一些特定的观察到的差距：对熟悉领域（如餐馆和笔记本电脑）的反复关注，用于复杂四元组抽取任务的有限数据，以及偶尔忽视句子和评论级情感之间的协同作用。此外，为了阐明OATS的潜在能力，",
