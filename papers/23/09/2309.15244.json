    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel training approach called the Homotopy Relaxation Training Algorithm (HRTA), aimed at accelerating the training process in contrast to traditional methods. Our algorithm incorporates two key mechanisms: one involves building a homotopy activation function that seamlessly connects the linear activation function with the ReLU activation function; the other technique entails relaxing the homotopy parameter to enhance the training refinement process. We have conducted an in-depth analysis of this novel method within the context of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), revealing significantly improved convergence rates. Our experimental results, especially when considering networks with larger widths, validate the theoretical conclusions. This proposed HRTA exhibits the potential for other activation functions and deep neural networks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的训练方法，称为同伦松弛训练算法（HRTA），旨在加速训练过程，与传统方法相比。我们的算法结合了两个关键机制：一个是构建无缝连接线性激活函数和ReLU激活函数的同伦激活函数；另一个技术是松弛同伦参数以增强训练精细化过程。我们在神经切线核（NTK）的背景下对这种新方法进行了深入分析，揭示了显著改进的收敛速度。我们的实验结果，尤其是在考虑更大宽度的网络时，验证了理论结论。这种提议的HRTA展示了对其他激活函数和深度神经网络的潜力。",
