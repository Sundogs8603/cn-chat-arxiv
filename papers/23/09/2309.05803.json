    "translated_abstract": "任何机器人学习流程的关键设计决策是选择策略表示形式：应该使用什么类型的模型来生成下一步的机器人动作？由于许多机器人任务具有固有的多模态特性，并且结合了生成模型的最新成功，研究人员已经转向使用最先进的概率模型，如扩散模型进行策略表示。在这项工作中，我们重访了将能量模型（EBM）作为一种策略类别的选择。我们证明了现有的普遍传言——高维连续空间中的能量模型不容易训练是错误的。我们开发了一种实用的训练目标和算法，用于能量模型，其中结合了几个关键要素：(i) 评级噪声对比估计 (R-NCE)，(ii) 可学习的负采样器，以及 (iii) 非对抗性联合训练。我们证明了我们提出的目标函数是渐近一致的，并量化了其极限方差。",
