    "translated_abstract": "尽管最近几年端到端（E2E）模型在语音识别方面取得了巨大的进展，但命名实体识别仍然具有挑战性但又对语义理解至关重要。为了增强E2E模型中识别命名实体的能力，先前的研究主要集中在各种基于规则或基于注意力的上下文偏置算法上。然而，它们的性能可能对偏置权重敏感，或者由于对命名实体列表的过度关注而降低，并且存在误触发的风险。受传统混合系统中基于类别的语言模型（LM）在命名实体识别中的成功启发，以及在分解神经传输器（FNT）中声学和语言信息的有效解耦，我们提出了一种新颖的E2E模型来将基于类别的LMs纳入FNT中，称为C-FNT。在C-FNT中，命名实体的语言模型得分可以与其类别关联，而不是与其表面形式关联。",
