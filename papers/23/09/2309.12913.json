    "abstract": "Saliency maps have become one of the most widely used interpretability techniques for convolutional neural networks (CNN) due to their simplicity and the quality of the insights they provide. However, there are still some doubts about whether these insights are a trustworthy representation of what CNNs use to come up with their predictions. This paper explores how rescuing the sign of the gradients from the saliency map can lead to a deeper understanding of multi-class classification problems. Using both pretrained and trained from scratch CNNs we unveil that considering the sign and the effect not only of the correct class, but also the influence of the other classes, allows to better identify the pixels of the image that the network is really focusing on. Furthermore, how occluding or altering those pixels is expected to affect the outcome also becomes clearer.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于其简单性和提供的见解质量，显著图已成为卷积神经网络（CNN）最广泛使用的可解释性技术之一。然而，对于这些见解是否可信仍存在一些疑问，是否真正代表CNN用于预测的信息。本文探讨了如何通过从显著图中挽救梯度的符号来更深入地理解多类别分类问题。通过使用预训练和从头开始训练的CNN，我们揭示了考虑正确类别的符号和影响，以及其他类别的影响，可以更好地识别网络真正关注的图像像素。此外，遮挡或改变这些像素预计会如何影响结果也变得更加清晰。",
