    "abstract": "We carefully evaluate a number of algorithms for learning in a federated environment, and test their utility for a variety of image classification tasks. We consider many issues that have not been adequately considered before: whether learning over data sets that do not have diverse sets of images affects the results; whether to use a pre-trained feature extraction \"backbone\"; how to evaluate learner performance (we argue that classification accuracy is not enough), among others. Overall, across a wide variety of settings, we find that vertically decomposing a neural network seems to give the best results, and outperforms more standard reconciliation-used methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们对一系列在联邦学习环境中进行学习的算法进行了认真评估，并测试它们在各种图像分类任务中的效用。我们考虑了许多以前没有充分考虑的问题：是否学习不具有多样图像集的数据集会影响结果；是否使用预训练的特征提取“骨干”；如何评估学习者的性能（我们认为仅仅分类准确性是不够的）等。总体而言，在各种设置下，我们发现对神经网络进行垂直分解似乎能够得到最佳结果，并且优于更常见的协调方法。",
