    "translated_abstract": "微视频最近变得非常受欢迎，引发了对微视频推荐的重要研究，对娱乐、广告和电子商务行业具有重要影响。然而，缺乏大规模的公共微视频数据集为开发有效的推荐系统提供了挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们介绍了一个非常庞大的微视频推荐数据集，名为\"MicroLens\"，包括十亿个用户-项目交互行为，3400万个用户和100万个微视频。该数据集还包含有关视频的各种原始模态信息，包括标题、封面图像、音频和完整视频。MicroLens作为内容驱动的微视频推荐的基准，使研究人员能够利用各种视频信息的模态进行推荐，而不仅仅依赖于项目ID或从预训练网络中提取的现成视频特征。",
