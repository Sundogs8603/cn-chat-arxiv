    "translated_abstract": "时间序列分类（TSC）已成为各个领域中的一个重要任务，在TSC任务中，深度神经模型显示出优越的性能。然而，这些模型容易受到对抗攻击的影响，微小的扰动可以显著影响预测结果。现有的对抗方法经常面临着超参数化或随机logit扰动的问题，从而影响其效果。此外，提高攻击成功率（ASR）通常需要生成更多的噪声，使得攻击更容易被检测出来。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的针对TSC模型的攻击方法SWAP。SWAP主要关注提高次级logits的置信度，同时最小化对其他logits的干扰。这是通过最小化目标logit分布和预测logit分布之间的Kullback-Leibler散度来实现的。实验结果表明，SWAP取得了最先进的性能，ASR达到了...",
