    "translated_abstract": "在农业实践中，准确预测特定地区干旱概率对于决策具有重要性。尤其对于长期决策，提前一年进行预测至关重要。然而，由于感兴趣区域及其相邻区域内各种因素的复杂相互作用，预测这一概率存在挑战。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于各种时空神经网络的端到端解决方案来解决这个问题。所考虑的模型主要是根据Palmer干旱严重指数（PDSI）预测感兴趣亚区的干旱强度，利用气候模型的内在因素和见解来提高干旱预测的准确性。比较评估结果表明，与基准梯度提升和逻辑回归解决方案相比，卷积LSTM（ConvLSTM）和Transformer模型的准确性更高。前两种模型取得了令人印象深刻的ROC AUC分数，高达0.90",
