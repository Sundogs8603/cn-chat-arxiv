    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了顺序变化检测的问题，目标是设计一个能够检测数据流分布中参数或函数𝜃的任何变化的方案，该方案具有较小的检测延迟，但在没有变化的情况下能够保证假警报的频率受控。在本文中，我们使用置信序列描述了一种从顺序变化检测到顺序估计的简单约化方法：我们在每个时间步开始一个新的$(1-\\alpha)$置信序列，并在所有活动置信序列的交集为空时宣布变化。我们证明了平均持续时间至少为$1/\\alpha$，从而得到了具有最小结构假设的变化检测方案（因此允许可能相关的观测和非参数分布类），但却具有强大的保证。我们的方法与Lorden（1971）的变化检测到顺序测试的简化和Shin等人的e-detector有着有趣的相似之处。",
