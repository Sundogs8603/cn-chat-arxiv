Lebanon is at the heart of the Levant fault system that has generated several Mw>7 earthquakes, the latest being in 1759. It is one of the countries with the highest seismic risk in the Mediterranean region. This is due to the high seismic vulnerability of the buildings due to the absence of mandatory s",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数地震风险评估方法着重于估计建筑环境的损失和相应的社会经济损失，而没有充分考虑社会风险因素。然而，人类行为是预测地震对人类影响的关键因素，因此，在定量风险评估研究中包含它是重要的。本研究采用一种跨学科的方法，利用代理模型模拟城市规模的行人地震疏散。该模型整合了地震危险、物理易损性以及个体行为和活动能力。模拟器应用于黎巴嫩贝鲁特的案例。黎巴嫩位于黎凡特断裂带系统的核心地区，该断裂带已经发生过多次Mw>7的地震，最近一次是在1759年。黎巴嫩是地中海地区地震风险最高的国家之一，这是由于建筑物的高地震易损性以及缺乏强制性的建筑规定所致。",
