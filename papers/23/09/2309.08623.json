    "translated_abstract": "Lewy体痴呆是第二常见的神经退行性痴呆类型，早期识别，即由Lewy体引起的轻度认知功能障碍（MCI-LB），对于提供适当的护理非常重要。然而，由于其临床表现多样性以及与其他病症（如阿尔茨海默病引起的轻度认知功能障碍）的相似之处，MCI-LB经常被低估。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种基于机器学习的自动流程管道，通过利用鞋垫传感器在30秒站立任务期间获取的平衡测量来帮助识别MCI-LB。98名参与者（14名MCI-LB、38名MCI-AD、46名认知正常人）的实验结果显示，所得到的模型能够以高达78.0%的准确率（AUC: 0.681）将MCI-LB与其他组别进行区分，这比基于人口统计和临床神经心理测量的参考模型的准确率提高了6.8%。我们的发现可能为一种新的方法打开了大门。",
