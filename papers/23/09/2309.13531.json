    "translated_abstract": "主成分分析是一种广泛使用的统计工具，主要用于降维。然而，已知样本中存在异常观测会对主成分分析产生不利影响，而这种情况相当普遍。使用M估计的鲁棒主成分分析方法具有理论上的优点，但在高维数据时其鲁棒性显著下降。另一方面，解决主成分追踪或类似优化问题的鲁棒主成分分析算法具有较高的鲁棒性，但缺乏理论丰富性，并且与M估计相比要求更高的计算能力。我们引入了一种基于最小密度功率差异估计的新型鲁棒主成分分析估计量，它结合了M估计和最小差异估计的理论优势，并且无论数据维度如何都具有很高的鲁棒性保证。我们提出了一种计算高效的算法来获取这个估计值。我们的理论发现得到了广泛的仿真支持。",
