    "translated_abstract": "脑-计算机接口（BCIs）为大脑与外部设备之间提供了直接通道，并展示了对辅助和康复技术的巨大潜力。基于脑电图（EEG）信号的内源性BCIs，如运动想象（MI）BCIs，可以提供一定程度的控制。然而，掌握自发BCI控制需要用户通过想象生成明显且稳定的脑信号模式，这是具有挑战性的，并且通常需要很长时间的训练（几周/几个月）。在这里，我们提出了一种人机联合学习框架，通过引导用户将脑信号生成为解码器估计的最优分布，以促进内源性BCIs的学习过程。为此，我们首先以统一的形式建模人机联合学习过程。然后提出了一种人机联合学习框架：1）对于人类方面，我们模拟学习过程",
