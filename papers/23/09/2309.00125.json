    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a new mechanism for releasing differentially private functional summaries called the Independent Component Laplace Process, or ICLP, mechanism. By treating the functional summaries of interest as truly infinite-dimensional objects and perturbing them with the ICLP noise, this new mechanism relaxes assumptions on data trajectories and preserves higher utility compared to classical finite-dimensional subspace embedding approaches in the literature. We establish the feasibility of the proposed mechanism in multiple function spaces. Several statistical estimation problems are considered, and we demonstrate by slightly over-smoothing the summary, the privacy cost will not dominate the statistical error and is asymptotically negligible. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们提出了一种称为独立分量拉普拉斯过程（ICLP）机制的差分隐私函数性摘要的新机制。通过将感兴趣的函数性摘要视为真正无限维对象，并使用ICLP噪声来扰动它们，该新机制放宽了关于数据轨迹的假设，并相对于文献中的经典有限维子空间嵌入方法保留了更高的效用。我们在多个函数空间中验证了所提出机制的可行性。我们考虑了几个统计估计问题，并通过轻微过平滑摘要来证明隐私成本不会主导统计误差，并且在渐近情况下可以忽略。对合成和真实数据集的数值实验证明了所提出机制的有效性。",
