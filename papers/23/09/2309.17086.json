    "abstract": "Due to the lack of a feedback channel in the C-V2X sidelink, finding a suitable modulation and coding scheme (MCS) is a difficult task. However, recent use cases for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication with higher demands on data rate necessitate choosing the MCS adaptively. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to predict suitable MCS levels. Additionally, we propose the use of quantile prediction and evaluate it in combination with different algorithms for the task of predicting the MCS level with the highest achievable data rate. Thereby, we show significant improvements over conventional methods of choosing the MCS level. Using a machine learning approach, however, requires larger real-world data sets than are currently publicly available for research. For this reason, this paper presents a data set that was acquired in extensive drive tests, and that we make publicly available.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于C-V2X侧链中缺乏反馈信道，找到合适的调制和编码方案（MCS）是一项困难的任务。然而，对于在车辆到一切（V2X）通信中对数据速率要求更高的最新使用案例，需要自适应地选择MCS。在本文中，我们提出了一种机器学习方法来预测合适的MCS级别。另外，我们提出了使用分位数预测，并将其与不同算法结合起来评估预测具有最高可达数据速率的MCS级别的任务。通过这样做，我们展示了与传统的选择MCS级别的方法相比，显著的改进。然而，使用机器学习方法需要比目前公开可用于研究的更大的真实世界数据集。因此，本文提供了一个通过广泛的行驶测试获得的数据集，并公开可用。",
