    "abstract": "We introduce two new extensions to the beam search algorithm based on conformal predictions (CP) to produce sets of sequences with theoretical coverage guarantees. The first method is very simple and proposes dynamically-sized subsets of beam search results but, unlike typical CP procedures, has an upper bound on the achievable guarantee depending on a post-hoc calibration measure. Our second algorithm introduces the conformal set prediction procedure as part of the decoding process, producing a variable beam width which adapts to the current uncertainty. While more complex, this procedure can achieve coverage guarantees selected a priori. We provide marginal coverage bounds for each method, and evaluate them empirically on a selection of tasks drawing from natural language processing and chemistry.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了基于符合性预测的波束搜索算法的两个新扩展，用于产生具有理论覆盖保证的序列集合。第一种方法非常简单，提出了动态大小的波束搜索结果子集，但与典型的符合性程序不同，它在可达到的保证上有一个上界，取决于事后校准度量。我们的第二种算法将符合性集预测过程作为解码过程的一部分，产生一个能够根据当前的不确定性进行调整的可变波束宽度。虽然更复杂，但该过程可以实现预先选定的覆盖保证。我们为每种方法提供边缘覆盖边界，并在从自然语言处理和化学中选择的任务上进行了实证评估。",

The first method provides dynamically-sized subsets of beam search results, but with an upper bound on the achievable guarantee. The second algorithm combines the conformal set prediction procedure with the decoding process, resulting in a variable beam width that can adjust to the current uncertainty. These methods are empirically evaluated in tasks related to natural language processing and chemistry."
