    "abstract": "Training high-quality instance segmentation models requires an abundance of labeled images with instance masks and classifications, which is often expensive to procure. Active learning addresses this challenge by striving for optimum performance with minimal labeling cost by selecting the most informative and representative images for labeling. Despite its potential, active learning has been less explored in instance segmentation compared to other tasks like image classification, which require less labeling. In this study, we propose a post-hoc active learning algorithm that integrates uncertainty-based sampling with diversity-based sampling. Our proposed algorithm is not only simple and easy to implement, but it also delivers superior performance on various datasets. Its practical application is demonstrated on a real-world overhead imagery dataset, where it increases the labeling efficiency fivefold.",

    "translated_abstract": "训练高质量的实例分割模型需要大量带有实例掩码和分类的标记图像，而这往往是昂贵的。主动学习通过选择最具信息量和代表性的图像进行标注，以在最小标注成本下追求最佳性能，从而解决了这一挑战。尽管主动学习在实例分割领域具有潜力，但与其他任务（如图像分类）相比，实例分割领域的研究较少，后者的标注需求较少。在本研究中，我们提出了一种后续主动学习算法，将基于不确定性的采样与基于多样性的采样结合起来。我们提出的算法不仅简单易实现，而且在各种数据集上均表现出卓越性能。在一个实际的遥感图像数据集上展示了它的实际应用，它使标注效率提高了五倍。",
