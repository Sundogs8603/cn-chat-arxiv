    "translated_abstract": "尽管将生成型AI应用于教育领域已有不少进展，但对于学生和AI系统之间大规模且真实的互动的实证分析仍然很有限。在本研究中，我们介绍了ChEDDAR，即ChatGPT和EFL学习者的对话数据集，该数据集是在一个学期长的纵向实验中收集的，研究对象包括212名参加英语作为外语（EFL）写作课程的大学生。学生被要求通过与ChatGPT的对话来修改他们的文章。ChEDDAR包括对话日志，话语级别的文章编辑历史，自我评价满意度和学生意图，以及记录他们目标和整体体验的会话级别的前后调查。我们分析了学生对生成型AI的使用模式和感知，以及他们的意图和满意度。作为基础性步骤，我们为教育背景下任务导向对话系统的两个关键任务建立了基准结果：在……",
