This paper explores the utilization of Python algorithms to automate the process of solving these puzzles, offering a computational approach that enhances efficiency and accessibility. In this work, we aim to develop a Python algorithm capable of parsing and analyzing the statements provided in the Knight and Knave puzzles. A logical reasoning framework is integrated within the algorithm to deduce the identities of the characters based on their statements. The algorithm processes the input statements, create a knowledge base, and make deductions following the rules of Knight and Knave logic. The developed algorithm is thoroughly ",
