    "translated_abstract": "反事实遗憾最小化（CFR）及其变体是目前解决大规模不完全信息博弈的最佳算法。本文在CFR的基础上提出了一种名为纯CFR（PCFR）的新算法，以实现更好的性能。PCFR可以看作是CFR和虚拟游戏（FP）的结合，继承了CFR的反事实遗憾（值）的概念，并在下一次迭代中使用最佳响应策略而不是遗憾匹配策略。我们的理论证明了PCFR可以实现Blackwell可达性，使PCFR能够与包括蒙特卡洛CFR（MCCFR）在内的任何CFR变体相结合。由此产生的纯MCCFR（PMCCFR）可以大大降低时间和空间复杂度。特别地，PMCCFR的收敛速度至少比MCCFR快三倍。此外，由于PMCCFR不通过严格被支配策略的路径，我们开发了一种新的启动算法，受到了严格被支配策略的启示。",
