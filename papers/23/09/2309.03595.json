    "abstract": "ChatGPT, a software seeking to simulate human conversational abilities, is attracting increasing attention. It is sometimes portrayed as a groundbreaking productivity aid, including for creative work. In this paper, we run an experiment to assess its potential in complex writing tasks. We ask the software to compose a policy brief for the Board of the Bank of Italy. We find that ChatGPT can accelerate workflows by providing well-structured content suggestions, and by producing extensive, linguistically correct text in a matter of seconds. It does, however, require a significant amount of expert supervision, which partially offsets productivity gains. If the app is used naively, output can be incorrect, superficial, or irrelevant. Superficiality is an especially problematic limitation in the context of policy advice intended for high-level audiences.",

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT是一款寻求模拟人类对话能力的软件，引起了越来越多的关注。有时它被描述为一款开创性的生产力辅助工具，包括用于创意工作。本文通过进行实验来评估ChatGPT在复杂写作任务中的潜力。我们要求该软件为意大利银行董事会撰写一份政策简报。我们发现，ChatGPT能够通过提供良好结构的内容建议以及在几秒钟内生成大量的语言正确的文本，加快工作流程。然而，它需要大量专家监督，这在一定程度上抵消了生产力的增益。如果应用程序使用得不够谨慎，输出可能会不正确、肤浅或不相关。肤浅性在面向高级受众的政策建议背景下尤其是一个问题。",
