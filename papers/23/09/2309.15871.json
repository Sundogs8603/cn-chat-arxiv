    "abstract": "In many areas of decision-making, forecasting is an essential pillar. Consequently, many different forecasting methods have been proposed. From our experience, recently presented forecasting methods are computationally intensive, poorly automated, tailored to a particular data set, or they lack a predictable time-to-result. To this end, we introduce Telescope, a novel machine learning-based forecasting approach that automatically retrieves relevant information from a given time series and splits it into parts, handling each of them separately. In contrast to deep learning methods, our approach doesn't require parameterization or the need to train and fit a multitude of parameters. It operates with just one time series and provides forecasts within seconds without any additional setup. Our experiments show that Telescope outperforms recent methods by providing accurate and reliable forecasts while making no assumptions about the analyzed time series.",

    "translated_abstract": "在决策的许多领域，预测是一个重要的支柱。因此，提出了许多不同的预测方法。根据我们的经验，最近提出的预测方法计算密集，自动化程度低，针对特定数据集定制，或者缺乏可预测的结果时间。为此，我们引入了Telescope，一种新颖的基于机器学习的预测方法，它可以自动从给定的时间序列中检索相关信息，并将其分割成部分，分别处理每个部分。与深度学习方法不同，我们的方法不需要参数化或训练和适配大量参数。它只使用一个时间序列，在几秒钟内提供预测，无需额外设置。我们的实验证明，Telescope通过提供准确可靠的预测，同时对分析的时间序列不做任何假设，胜过了最近的方法。",
