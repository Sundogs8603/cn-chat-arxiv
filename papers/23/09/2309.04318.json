    "translated_abstract": "大多数真实世界的分类任务都存在着一定程度的标签噪声。这种数据中的噪声对于学习模型的泛化误差产生不利影响，并且使得噪声处理方法的评估变得复杂，因为没有清晰的标签，无法准确衡量其性能。在标签噪声研究中，通常接受有噪声或简单的模拟数据作为基线，然后注入具有已知属性的额外噪声。在本文中，我们提出了SYNLABEL，这是一个旨在改进上述方法的框架。它允许通过预先指定或学习一个函数，并将其定义为生成标签的基本真值函数，从而创建一个无噪声的数据集。此外，通过在函数域中的选定特征上重新采样一些值，评估函数并汇总结果标签，可以为每个数据点分配一个软标签或标签分布。",
