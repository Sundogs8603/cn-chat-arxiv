    "translated_abstract": "虽然会话推荐系统（SBRS）已经表现出卓越的推荐性能，但多任务学习（MTL）已经被SBRS采用以进一步提高其预测准确性和可泛化性。层次化多任务学习（H-MTL）在预测任务之间设置了层次结构，并将辅助任务的输出馈送给主任务。与现有的MTL框架相比，这种层次结构为主任务提供了更丰富的输入特征和更高的预测可解释性。然而，H-MTL框架在SBRS中尚未进行研究。在本文中，我们提出了HierSRec，将H-MTL架构纳入SBRS中。HierSRec使用元数据感知Transformer对给定会话进行编码，并使用会话编码进行下一类别预测（即辅助任务）。接下来，HierSRec使用类别预测结果和会话编码进行下一个物品预测（即主任务）。为了可扩展的推断，HierSRec创建了一个紧凑的候选物品集合。",
