    "abstract": "We evaluated ChatGPT 3.5, 4, and 4 with Code Interpreter on a set of college-level engineering-math and electromagnetism problems, such as those often given to sophomore electrical engineering majors. We selected a set of 13 problems, and had ChatGPT solve them multiple times, using a fresh instance (chat) each time. We found that ChatGPT-4 with Code Interpreter was able to satisfactorily solve most problems we tested most of the time -- a major improvement over the performance of ChatGPT-4 (or 3.5) without Code Interpreter. The performance of ChatGPT was observed to be somewhat stochastic, and we found that solving the same problem N times in new ChatGPT instances and taking the most-common answer was an effective strategy. Based on our findings and observations, we provide some recommendations for instructors and students of classes at this level.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们评估了ChatGPT 3.5、4以及带有代码解释器的ChatGPT 4在一组大学级工程数学和电磁学问题上的表现，这些问题通常是给大二的电气工程专业学生的。我们选择了一组13个问题，并让ChatGPT多次解决它们，每次都使用一个新的实例（交谈）。我们发现，带有代码解释器的ChatGPT-4能够大部分时间令人满意地解决我们测试的大多数问题，这是相比于没有代码解释器的ChatGPT-4（或3.5）的性能有了重大改进。我们观察到ChatGPT的性能有些随机性，因此我们发现在新的ChatGPT实例中多次解决相同的问题并选择最常见的答案是一种有效的策略。基于我们的研究结果和观察，我们为这个水平的教师和学生提供了一些建议。",
