    "translated_abstract": "结构学习是因果推断的关键。值得注意的是，当数据稀缺时，因果发现（CD）算法很脆弱，可能推断出与专家知识相矛盾的不准确因果关系，尤其是考虑到潜在混淆因素时更是如此。为了加重这个问题，大多数CD方法并不提供不确定性估计，这使得用户难以解释结果和改进推断过程。令人惊讶的是，尽管CD是一个以人为中心的事务，但没有任何研究专注于构建既能输出专家可验证的不确定性估计又能与专家进行交互迭代改进的方法。为了解决这些问题，我们首先提出使用生成流网，根据基于评分函数（如贝叶斯信息准则）的信念分布，按比例对（因果）祖先图进行采样。然后，我们利用候选图的多样性并引入最佳实验设计，以迭代性地探索实验来与专家互动。",
