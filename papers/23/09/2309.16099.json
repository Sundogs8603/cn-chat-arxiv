    "translated_abstract": "灵活估计治疗方案下的平均结果（即价值函数）是个性化医学的关键步骤。我们将目标参数定义为给定一组基线协变量的条件价值函数，我们称之为基于分层的价值函数。我们专注于半参数化决策规则的类别，并在该类别中提出了一种基于筛选的非参数协变量调整方案响应曲线估计器。我们的工作在多个方面有所贡献。首先，我们提出了一种反概率加权的非参数高效估计器以平滑的方案响应曲线函数。我们证明了当干扰函数被足够地欠平滑时，渐近线性性得以实现。我们提出了幂法和有限样本准则以进行欠平滑。其次，利用高斯过程理论，我们提出了对平滑的方案响应曲线函数的同时置信区间。第三，我们提供了优化问题的一致性和收敛速度。",
