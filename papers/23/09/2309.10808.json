    "abstract": "Machine learning and deep learning methods have been widely explored in understanding the chaotic behavior of the atmosphere and furthering weather forecasting. There has been increasing interest from technology companies, government institutions, and meteorological agencies in building digital twins of the Earth. Recent approaches using transformers, physics-informed machine learning, and graph neural networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on relatively narrow spatiotemporal scales and specific tasks. With the recent success of generative artificial intelligence (AI) using pre-trained transformers for language modeling and vision with prompt engineering and fine-tuning, we are now moving towards generalizable AI. In particular, we are witnessing the rise of AI foundation models that can perform competitively on multiple domain-specific downstream tasks. Despite this progress, we are still in the nascent stages of a generalizable AI model for global Earth system models",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习和深度学习方法在理解大气的混沌行为和推进天气预报方面得到了广泛探索。科技公司、政府机构和气象机构对建立地球的数字孪生体表现出越来越大的兴趣。最近使用transformers、受物理知识启发的机器学习和图神经网络的方法在相对狭窄的时空范围和特定任务上展示了最先进的性能。随着使用预训练的transformers进行语言建模和视觉生成人工智能的最近成功，我们正在朝着可推广的人工智能模型迈进。特别是，我们正在见证能够在多个领域特定下游任务上有竞争力的AI基础模型的崛起。尽管取得了进展，但全球地球系统模型的可推广AI模型仍处于初级阶段。",
