    "abstract": "We introduce a new type of query mechanism for collecting human feedback, called the perceptual adjustment query ( PAQ). Being both informative and cognitively lightweight, the PAQ adopts an inverted measurement scheme, and combines advantages from both cardinal and ordinal queries. We showcase the PAQ in the metric learning problem, where we collect PAQ measurements to learn an unknown Mahalanobis distance. This gives rise to a high-dimensional, low-rank matrix estimation problem to which standard matrix estimators cannot be applied. Consequently, we develop a two-stage estimator for metric learning from PAQs, and provide sample complexity guarantees for this estimator. We present numerical simulations demonstrating the performance of the estimator and its notable properties.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种新的用于收集人类反馈的查询机制，称为感知调整查询（PAQ）。PAQ采用了反向测量方案，既具有信息量又轻量级，结合了基数查询和序数查询的优点。我们将PAQ展示在度量学习问题中，利用PAQ测量来学习未知的马氏距离。这导致了一个高维低秩矩阵估计问题，无法应用标准矩阵估计器。因此，我们开发了一个从PAQ中学习度量的两阶段估计器，并提供了该估计器的样本复杂性保证。我们通过数值模拟展示了该估计器的性能和显著特性。",
