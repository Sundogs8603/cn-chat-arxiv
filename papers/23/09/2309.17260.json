    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究结果表明，将拓扑导航分为机器人无关和机器人特定的组件可以提高导航性能，通过使用不同类型机器人收集的数据来训练机器人无关部分。然而，导航方法仍受到适合训练数据的稀缺性和计算缩放性差的限制。在本文中，我们提出了一个名为PlaceNav的方法，将机器人无关部分分为导航特定和通用的计算机视觉组件。我们利用视觉地点识别来选择拓扑导航流程中的子目标。这使得子目标选择更高效，并能够利用非机器人来源的大规模数据集增加训练数据的可用性。地点识别使得贝叶斯滤波成为可能，进一步通过增加子目标的时间一致性来提高导航性能。我们的实验结果验证了这一设计，并且新模型的性能提高了76%。",
