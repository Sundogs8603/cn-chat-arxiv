    "translated_abstract": "我提出了一个新的术语，国际贸易强度，它被定义为一个国家的总国际贸易与其国内生产总值之比。这个参数代表了一个国家利用其国内生产总值生成国际贸易的能力。这个数字等同于人均国内生产总值，代表了一个国家利用其人口生成国内生产总值的能力。贸易强度因国家而异。那么贸易强度遵循什么样的分布函数呢？在本文中，我们发展了一个关于预测贸易强度分布和贸易强度变化率的理论基础。这两个量被发现满足帕累托分布函数。通过将赤池信息准则（AIC）和贝叶斯信息准则（BIC）与五种类型的分布函数（指数分布、对数正态分布、伽马分布、帕累托分布和韦伯分布）进行比较，使用了来自世界综合贸易解决方案（WITS）和世界银行的数据，验证了这些方程。",
