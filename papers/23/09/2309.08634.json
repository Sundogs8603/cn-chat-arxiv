    "translated_abstract": "零售业务的关键挑战之一是如何选择要向消费者展示的产品（组合问题），以及如何定价产品（定价问题）以最大化收入或利润。我们提出了一种基于上下文强化学习的联合组合-定价方法，该方法同时考虑了组合和定价问题。我们的模型是双高维的，即上下文向量和行为都允许在高维空间中取值。为了克服维度灾难，我们提出了一个简单而灵活的模型，通过（近似）低秩表示矩阵来捕捉协变量和行为之间的相互作用。得到的模型类是相当表达力的，同时通过潜在因素保持可解释性，并包括不同结构化的线性强化学习和定价模型作为特殊情况。我们提出了一种计算可行的流程，将探索/利用协议与高效的低秩矩阵估计相结合。",
