    "translated_abstract": "多元时间序列（MTS）预测涉及基于历史观测来预测未来时间序列数据。现有研究主要强调开发能够明确捕捉时间序列变量之间的空间依赖性和时间相关性的复杂空间-时间模型。然而，最近的进展受到了数据稀缺性和模型鲁棒性的挑战。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了空间-时间掩蔽自动编码器（STMAE），这是一个MTS预测框架，利用掩蔽自动编码器来提高空间-时间基线模型的性能。STMAE包括两个学习阶段。在预训练阶段，采用编码器-解码器架构。编码器通过一种新颖的双掩蔽策略处理部分可见的MTS数据，包括基于偏置随机游走的空间掩蔽和基于补丁的时间掩蔽。随后，解码器旨在重构两个掩蔽对应物。",
