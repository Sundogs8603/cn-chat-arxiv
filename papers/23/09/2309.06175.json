    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to address the Entity Recognition and Linking Challenge at NLPCC 2015. The task involves extracting named entity mentions from short search queries and linking them to entities within a reference Chinese knowledge base. To tackle this problem, we first expand the existing knowledge base and utilize external knowledge to identify candidate entities, thereby improving the recall rate. Next, we extract features from the candidate entities and utilize Support Vector Regression and Multiple Additive Regression Tree as scoring functions to filter the results. Additionally, we apply rules to further refine the results and enhance precision. Our method is computationally efficient and achieves an F1 score of 0.535.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种解决NLPCC 2015中实体识别和链接挑战的新方法。该任务包括从短搜索查询中提取命名实体的提及，并将其链接到参考中文知识库中的实体。为了解决这个问题，我们首先扩展现有知识库，并利用外部知识识别候选实体，从而提高召回率。接下来，我们从候选实体中提取特征，并利用支持向量回归和多元加性回归树作为评分函数来过滤结果。此外，我们还应用规则来进一步细化结果和提高精度。我们的方法计算效率高，达到了0.535的F1分数。",
