    "abstract": "This paper explores the possibility of using ChatGPT to develop advanced phishing attacks and automate their large-scale deployment. We make ChatGPT generate the following parts of a phishing attack: i) cloning a targeted website, ii) integrating code for stealing credentials, iii) obfuscating code, iv) automating website deployment on a hosting provider, v) registering a phishing domain name, and vi) integrating the website with a reverse proxy. The initial assessment of the automatically generated phishing kits highlights their rapid generation and deployment process as well as the close resemblance of the resulting pages to the target website. More broadly, we demonstrate that recent advances in AI underscore the potential risks of its misuse in phishing attacks, which can lead to their increased prevalence and severity. This highlights the necessity for enhanced countermeasures within AI systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨使用ChatGPT开发高级网络钓鱼攻击并自动进行大规模部署的可能性。我们让ChatGPT生成网络钓鱼攻击的以下部分：i) 克隆目标网站，ii) 集成窃取凭据的代码，iii) 混淆代码，iv) 在托管提供商上自动化部署网站，v) 注册网络钓鱼域名，vi) 将网站与反向代理集成。对自动生成的网络钓鱼工具包的初步评估突出了它们快速生成和部署的过程，以及生成页面与目标网站的密切相似性。更广泛地说，我们展示了最近在人工智能方面的进展强调了在网络钓鱼攻击中滥用其潜力的风险，这可能导致它们的普遍性和严重性增加。这突显了AI系统中增强对策的必要性。",
