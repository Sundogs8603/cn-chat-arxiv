    "translated_abstract": "形状伺服是一种控制物体到达预期目标形状的机器人任务，对于可变形物体的操作具有潜在的应用前景。然而，目标形状的规定成为一个问题。目标形状通常通过繁琐的领域知识工程过程获取，或者通过手动操作物体到达所需形状并捕获该特定时刻的目标形状，这两种方法在各种机器人应用中都不切实际。本文通过开发一种新颖的神经网络DefGoalNet来解决这个问题，该网络可以直接从少量人类示范中学习可变形物体的目标形状。我们在模拟和实际机器人上展示了我们方法的有效性。值得注意的是，在手术撤退任务中，即使仅使用10个示范进行训练，我们的方法的成功率中值也接近90%。这些结果标志着在可变形物体操作中的重要进展。",
