    "abstract": "Action anticipation involves forecasting future actions by connecting past events to future ones. However, this reasoning ignores the real-life hierarchy of events which is considered to be composed of three main parts: past, present, and future. We argue that considering these three main parts and their dependencies could improve performance. On the other hand, online action detection is the task of predicting actions in a streaming manner. In this case, one has access only to the past and present information. Therefore, in online action detection (OAD) the existing approaches miss semantics or future information which limits their performance. To sum up, for both of these tasks, the complete set of knowledge (past-present-future) is missing, which makes it challenging to infer action dependencies, therefore having low performances. To address this limitation, we propose to fuse both tasks into a single uniform architecture. By combining action anticipation and online action detection",

    "translated_abstract": "动作预测涉及通过连接过去事件与未来事件来预测未来动作。然而，这种推理忽视了真实生活中事件的层次结构，它被认为包括过去、现在和未来三个主要部分。我们认为考虑这三个主要部分及其依赖关系可以提高性能。另一方面，在线动作检测是在流式方式下预测动作的任务。在这种情况下，只能访问过去和现在的信息。因此，在在线动作检测中，现有的方法忽视了语义或未来信息，限制了它们的性能。总的来说，对于这两个任务，缺失了完整的知识集合（过去-现在-未来），这使得推断动作依赖关系具有挑战性，因此性能较低。为了解决这个限制，我们提出将这两个任务融合成一个统一的架构。通过结合动作预测和在线动作检测，",
