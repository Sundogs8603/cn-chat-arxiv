    "translated_abstract": "逻辑规则对于发现关系之间的逻辑连接至关重要，可以提高推理性能并提供可解释的知识图谱结果。尽管已经有许多努力在知识图谱上挖掘有意义的逻辑规则，但现有方法在规则空间上搜索计算密集且缺乏可伸缩性，尤其是对于大规模知识图谱。此外，它们常常忽视了关系的语义，而这对于揭示逻辑连接至关重要。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理领域和各种应用中展现出了令人瞩目的性能，归功于它们的新能力和泛化能力。在本文中，我们提出了一个新颖的框架ChatRule，利用大型语言模型挖掘知识图谱中的逻辑规则。具体而言，该框架以基于LLM的规则生成器为初始，充分利用了知识图谱的语义和结构信息。",
