    "translated_abstract": "在贷款领域，价格既与客户有关又与产品有关，确保一个良好运作的个性化定价策略对业务决策至关重要。通常情况下，此类策略必须基于观测数据推导而来，这会引入一些挑战。虽然“内生性”问题在现有的定价文献中得到了广泛研究，但选择偏差问题（或者更准确地说是出价选择偏差问题）还未得到重视。我们从因果推断的角度探讨选择偏差的影响。具体而言，我们将定价问题视为一个因果推断问题，考虑客户对价格的反应作为一种治疗效应。在实验中，我们通过在比利时的抵押贷款申请半合成数据集上模拟不同程度的选择偏差，研究参数化和非参数化方法在识别个体出价响应函数方面的潜力。我们的结果展示了传统方法（如逻辑回归）在处理选择偏差问题上的局限性，并提出了更全面的解决方案。",
