    "translated_abstract": "局部敏感哈希（LSH）是一种在许多机器学习任务中广泛使用的有效的随机化技术。哈希的成本与数据维度成正比，因此当维度很高且涉及大量哈希函数时，哈希往往成为性能瓶颈。然而，出人意料的是，很少有工作在改进LSH计算的效率方面做出努力。在本文中，我们设计了一种简单而高效的LSH方案，名为FastLSH，使用l2范数。通过结合随机采样和随机投影，FastLSH将时间复杂度从O（n）降低到O（m）（m < n），其中n是数据维度，m是抽样维度的数量。此外，FastLSH具有可证明的LSH属性，使其与非LSH快速草图有所区别。我们对一组真实和合成数据集进行了全面的实验，用于最近邻搜索任务。实验结果表明，FastLSH在答案质量方面与现有技术处于同一水平。",
