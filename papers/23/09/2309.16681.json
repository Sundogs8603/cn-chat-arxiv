    "translated_abstract": "语义通信（SemCom）通过仅尝试恢复数据的基本语义信息，相对于传统的位级准确传输展现出很大的优势。为了解决信道的非可微性，本文提出了一种名为SparseSBC的基于交替学习的SemCom系统，用于视觉传输。SparseSBC在发射端和接收端分别利用两个基于深度神经网络（DNN）的模型，并以交替的方式学习编码和解码，而不是现有文献中的联合优化，以解决信道的非可微性。具体而言，还采用了“自批评”训练方案以实现稳定训练。此外，基于DNN的发射机使用二进制量化模块，在对语义准确性影响最小的基础上生成一组稀疏的位于推导“语义基”的位。广泛的仿真结果验证了SparseSBC的性能显著。",
