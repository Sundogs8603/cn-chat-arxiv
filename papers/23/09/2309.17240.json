    "translated_abstract": "本文使用基于物理信息神经网络（PINNs）算法的深度学习方法研究了数据驱动的局域波解和在大Thirring模型中的参数发现。通过精确模拟和相对误差、绝对误差的对比分析，得到了丰富的数据驱动解，包括明亮/暗淡型孤子，呼吸子和流氓波。对于高阶局域波解，我们采用扩展PINNs（XPINNs）和域分解的方法来捕捉动态行为的完整图像，如孤子碰撞，呼吸子振荡和流氓波叠加。特别地，我们将XPINNs中的界面线修改为一个小的界面区域，并引入伪初值、残差和梯度条件作为与各个神经网络相邻的界面条件。然后我们成功地将这种修改的方法应用于各种解，包括明亮-明亮的孤子，暗淡-暗淡的孤子，和暗淡-明亮的孤子等。",
