    "translated_abstract": "在许多接触丰富的任务中，力传感在适应操纵对象的物理特性方面起着至关重要的作用。为了使机器人能够捕捉到学习的操纵任务泛化到未知对象所需的对象属性的基本分布，现有的示范学习方法需要大量昂贵的人类示范。我们提出的半监督示范学习方法将学习模型分解为触觉表示编码器和动作生成解码器。这使我们能够使用大量无监督数据预先训练触觉表示编码器，同时使用少样本示范学习训练动作生成解码器，从人类学习技能的好处。我们在使用不同刚度和表面摩擦的海绵上验证了该方法在擦拭任务中的效果。我们的结果表明，预训练显著提高了示范学习模型识别物理特性和生成所需擦拭动作的能力。",
