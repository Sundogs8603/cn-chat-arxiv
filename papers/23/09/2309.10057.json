    "abstract": "Information extraction systems often produce hundreds to thousands of strings on a specific topic. We present a method that facilitates better consumption of these strings, in an exploratory setting in which a user wants to both get a broad overview of what's available, and a chance to dive deeper on some aspects. The system works by grouping similar items together and arranging the remaining items into a hierarchical navigable DAG structure. We apply the method to medical information extraction.",

    "translated_abstract": "信息提取系统通常会产生数百到数千个关于特定主题的字符串。我们提出了一种方法，以在探索性环境中更好地消费这些字符串，其中用户既想获得广泛的概述，又想有机会深入研究某些方面。该系统通过将相似的项目分组并将剩余项目按照层次化可导航的有向无环图结构进行排列。我们将该方法应用于医疗信息提取。",
    "tldr": "这个论文介绍了一种层级构建器的方法，可以将信息提取系统生成的大量字符串进行组织和导航，特别适用于医疗信息提取。",
