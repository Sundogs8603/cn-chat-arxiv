    "abstract": "We consider the problem of optimization of contributions of a financial planner such as a working individual towards a financial goal such as retirement. The objective of the planner is to find an optimal and feasible schedule of periodic installments to an investment portfolio set up towards the goal. Because portfolio returns are random, the practical version of the problem amounts to finding an optimal contribution scheme such that the goal is satisfied at a given confidence level. This paper suggests a semi-analytical approach to a continuous-time version of this problem based on a controlled backward Kolmogorov equation (BKE) which describes the tail probability of the terminal wealth given a contribution policy. The controlled BKE is solved semi-analytically by reducing it to a controlled Schrodinger equation and solving the latter using an algebraic method. Numerically, our approach amounts to finding semi-analytical solutions simultaneously for all values of control parameters ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了针对财务目标（如退休）的金融规划师（如工作个体）的贡献优化问题。规划师的目标是找到一个最优且可行的定期分期付款计划，以便建立一个朝着目标的投资组合。由于投资组合的回报是随机的，因此问题的实际版本相当于找到一个最优的贡献方案，以便在给定的置信水平下满足目标。本文提出了一种基于控制反向Kolmogorov方程（BKE）的连续时间版本的半解析方法，该方程描述了在给定贡献策略的情况下的终端财富的尾部概率。通过将控制BKE半解析地归约为控制Schrodinger方程并利用代数方法求解后者，我们得到了数值上的解析解，同时适用于所有控制参数的值。",
