    "abstract": "Asymmetric information in healthcare implies that patients could have difficulty trading off non-health and health related information. I document effects on patient demand when predicted wait time is disclosed to patients in an emergency department (ED) system. I use a regression discontinuity where EDs with similar predicted wait times display different online wait times to patients. I use impulse response functions estimated by local projections to demonstrate effects of the higher wait time. I find that an additional thirty minutes of wait time results in 15% fewer waiting patients at urgent cares and 2% fewer waiting patients at EDs within 3 hours of display. I find that the type of patient that stops using emergency care is triaged as having lower acuity and would have used an urgent care. However, I find that at very high wait times there are declines in all acuity patients including sick patients.",

    "translated_abstract": "医疗保健中的非对称信息意味着患者在交换非健康和健康相关信息时可能遇到困难。我记录了急诊科系统向患者披露预测等待时间时对患者需求产生的影响。我使用回归间断设计，在具有相似预测等待时间的急诊科中向患者展示不同的在线等待时间。我使用通过局部投影估计的脉冲响应函数来展示较高等待时间的影响。我发现，额外的30分钟等待时间导致急诊医疗中需等待的患者减少15％，而在展示后的3小时内，急诊科中需等待的患者减少2％。我发现停止使用急诊医疗的患者被分级为低病情紧急程度，并本应使用紧急医疗保健。然而，我发现在非常长的等待时间中，所有病情紧急程度的患者都出现了下降，包括病情严重的患者。",
    "tldr": "该研究发现披露预测的医疗等待时间对患者的需求有影响，较长的等待时间导致急诊科和紧急医疗保健中的等待患者减少。停止使用急诊医疗的患者通常病情不严重，并会选择使用紧急医疗保健。然而，在非常长的等待时间中，甚至包括病情严重的患者也出现了下降。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study finds that disclosing predicted healthcare wait times has an impact on patient demand, with longer wait times resulting in fewer waiting patients in emergency departments and urgent cares. Patients who stop using emergency care usually have lower acuity and would have chosen urgent care instead. However, there are declines in all acuity patients, including sick patients, at very high wait times."
