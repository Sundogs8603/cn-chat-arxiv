    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）取得了显著的进展，并在各个领域得到广泛应用。不幸的是，人们越来越担心LLMs可能被滥用来生成有害或恶意内容。尽管有一系列的研究专注于对齐LLMs与人类价值观，并防止它们生成不适当的内容，但这些对齐通常是脆弱的，并且可以通过对抗优化或手工构建的越狱提示来绕过。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一种稳健对齐的LLM（RA-LLM），以防范潜在的对齐破坏攻击。RA-LLM可以直接构建在现有的对齐LLM上，通过具有稳健对齐检查功能的方法，而无需对原始LLM进行任何昂贵的重新训练或微调。此外，我们还通过理论分析验证了RA-LLM在防御对齐破坏攻击方面的有效性。通过现实世界的实验，",
