    "abstract": "We discuss the emerging new opportunity for building feedback-rich computational models of social systems using generative artificial intelligence. Referred to as Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs), such individual-level models utilize large language models such as ChatGPT to represent human decision-making in social settings. We provide a GABM case in which human behavior can be incorporated in simulation models by coupling a mechanistic model of human interactions with a pre-trained large language model. This is achieved by introducing a simple GABM of social norm diffusion in an organization. For educational purposes, the model is intentionally kept simple. We examine a wide range of scenarios and the sensitivity of the results to several changes in the prompt. We hope the article and the model serve as a guide for building useful diffusion models that include realistic human reasoning and decision-making.",

    "tldr": "本文讨论了利用生成式人工智能构建反馈丰富的社会系统计算模型的新机会。我们介绍了一种称为生成式代理模型（GABMs）的个体级模型，它利用诸如ChatGPT之类的大型语言模型来表示社交环境中的人类决策。我们提供了一个GABM案例，通过将一个机械模型与一个预训练的大型语言模型相耦合，可以将人类行为纳入到模拟模型中。我们希望本文和模型能够成为构建包含真实人类推理和决策的有用扩散模型的指南。"
