    "translated_abstract": "随着可再生能源在电力混合中的扩张，电网的变化性将增加，因此需要加强系统以保证其安全性。因此，输电系统运营商必须进行分析，模拟未来发电系统的运行情况。然后，这些模拟结果被用作决策过程的输入。在这种情况下，我们研究使用深度学习模型来生成能源产量和负荷预测轨迹。为了捕捉这些多变量时间序列中的时空相关性，我们改进了自回归网络和归一化流模型，并证明它们对比当前基于copula的统计方法的有效性。我们对法国输电系统运营商RTE的风力预测数据进行了大量实验，并使用特定的时间序列生成评估指标比较了不同的模型。",

By adapting autoregressive networks and normalizing flows to capture spatiotemporal correlations, these methods demonstrate enhanced effectiveness compared to the current copula-based statistical approach. Extensive experiments conducted on French TSO RTE wind forecast data validate the superiority of the proposed models."
