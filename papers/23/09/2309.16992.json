In this paper, we propose SAMFeat to introduce SAM (segment anything model), a fundamental model trained on 11 million images, as a teacher to guide local feature learning and thus inspire higher performance on limited datasets. To do so, first, we construct an auxiliary task of Pixel Semantic Relational Distillation (PSRD), which distillates feature relations with category-agnostic semantic information learned by the SAM encoder into a local feature learning network, to improve local feature description using semantic discrimination.

    "translated_title": "Segment Anything Model对本地特征学习具有良好的教导作用",
    "translated_abstract": "本地特征的检测和描述在许多计算机视觉任务中起着重要作用，旨在检测和描述“任何场景”和“任何下游任务”的关键点。数据驱动的本地特征学习方法需要依赖于像素级一致性进行训练，这在大规模获得方面具有挑战性，从而阻碍了进一步的性能提升。在本文中，我们提出了SAMFeat来引入SAM（segment anything model）作为教师来指导本地特征学习，从而在有限的数据集上激发更高的性能。为此，首先，我们构建了一个像素语义关系蒸馏（PSRD）的辅助任务，将SAM编码器学习到的类别不可知的语义信息通过特征关系蒸馏到本地特征学习网络中，以提高通过语义区分改善本地特征描述的能力。其次，我们开发了一种称为弱监督对比学习的技术",
