For instance, when dealing with data types such as audio signals and documents, it is widely acknowledged that $\\beta$-divergences offer a more suitable alternative. In this paper, we develop new models and algorithms for deep NMF using $\\beta$-divergences.

    "translated_abstract": "深度非负矩阵分解（deep NMF）最近成为一种有价值的技术，用于在不同尺度上提取多层特征。然而，所有现有的深度NMF模型和算法主要都以最小二乘误差为评估标准，这可能不是评估多样化数据集近似质量的最合适指标。例如，当处理音频信号和文档等数据类型时，广泛认可的是$\\beta$-divergences提供了更适合的替代方案。本文基于$\\beta$-divergences开发了新的深度NMF模型和算法，并将这些技术应用于面部特征提取、文档集合中的主题识别以及高光谱图像中材料的识别。",
