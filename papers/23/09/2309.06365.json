We propose to condition instead on the \\textit{cited text span} (CTS) as an alternative to the abstract. Because manual CTS annotation is extremely time- and labor-intensive, we experiment with automatic, ROUGE-based labeling of candidate CTS sentences, achieving sufficiently strong performance to substitute for expensive human annotations, and we propose a human-in-the-loop, keyword-based CTS retrieval approach that makes generating citation texts grounded in the full text of cited papers both promising and practical.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了避免非事实性幻觉，自动相关工作生成必须将其输出与引文中的内容相关联，但由于科学文档的长度，现有的概括性方法只有在引文摘要的基础上进行。我们证明摘要并不总是引文生成的最佳输入，以及以这种方式训练的模型会出现幻觉。我们提出使用引文文本跨度(CTS)作为摘要的替代条件。由于手动CTS注释非常耗时且需要大量人力，我们尝试使用基于ROUGE的自动标注候选CTS句子，并取得足够强的性能以替代昂贵的人工注释，并提出了一种基于关键词的CTS检索方法，使得以引文全文为基础生成引文文本变得有前景和实际可行。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种弥合引用和引文文本之间距离的方法，通过使用引文文本跨度(CTS)替代摘要作为输入，从而使得引文生成更加准确和相关。通过自动标注和基于关键词的检索方法，可以实现高效的CTS标注，提高引文文本生成的效果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method to bridge the gap between citations and citation text generation by using Cited Text Spans (CTS) as an alternative to abstracts as input, resulting in more accurate and relevant citation generation. Through automatic labeling and keyword-based retrieval, efficient CTS annotation can be achieved to improve the effectiveness of citation text generation."
