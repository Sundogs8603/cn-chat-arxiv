    "abstract": "This paper presents ContrastWSD, a RoBERTa-based metaphor detection model that integrates the Metaphor Identification Procedure (MIP) and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) to extract and contrast the contextual meaning with the basic meaning of a word to determine whether it is used metaphorically in a sentence. By utilizing the word senses derived from a WSD model, our model enhances the metaphor detection process and outperforms other methods that rely solely on contextual embeddings or integrate only the basic definitions and other external knowledge. We evaluate our approach on various benchmark datasets and compare it with strong baselines, indicating the effectiveness in advancing metaphor detection.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了ContrastWSD，一种基于RoBERTa的隐喻检测模型，它集成了隐喻识别过程(MIP)和词义消岐(WSD)来提取并对比单词的上下文含义和基本含义，以确定它在句子中是否以隐喻的方式使用。通过利用WSD模型得出的单词词义，我们的模型增强了隐喻检测过程，并超过了仅依赖上下文嵌入或仅集成基本定义和其他外部知识的其他方法。我们在多个基准数据集上评估了我们的方法，并与强基线进行比较，结果表明它在推进隐喻检测方面的有效性。",

    "en_tdlr": "ContrastWSD is a metaphor detection model that uses Word Sense Disambiguation to enhance the detection process. By integrating the Metaphor Identification Procedure and WSD, it extracts and contrasts the contextual meaning and basic meaning of words, resulting in improved performance compared to other methods that rely solely on contextual embeddings or basic definitions."
