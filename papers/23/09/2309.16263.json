    "translated_abstract": "合作是多智能体系统（MAS）和多智能体强化学习（MARL）中的基本要素，通常要求智能体在个体收益和集体回报之间保持平衡。本文旨在研究在博弈理论情景中激发合作的策略，例如迭代囚徒困境，在这种情况下，智能体必须优化个体和团队的结果。分析了现有的合作策略对于促进重复博弈中团队导向行为的有效性。提出了一种修改，即鼓励团队回报也将导致更高的个体收益，解决了分布式系统中存在的现实困境。研究还扩展到智能体人口指数增长的情景（$N \\longrightarrow +\\infty$），在这种情况下，传统计算和平衡确定具有挑战性。利用均值场博弈理论，建立了无限大智能体集合中的平衡解和奖励结构。",
