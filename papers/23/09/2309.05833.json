    "translated_abstract": "近年来，IT行业向基于云的平台的转变强调了云事件根本原因分析的重要性，以确保服务的可靠性和维护客户信任。核心问题是有效确定根本原因，由于当代云基础设施的复杂性，这一任务变得具有挑战性。尽管出现了许多用于根本原因识别的基于AI的工具，但它们的适用性仍受到其输出质量不一致的限制。本文介绍了一种通过提示检索增强的大语言模型（LLM）来增强根本原因分析工具中置信度估计的方法。此方法分为两个阶段。首先，模型根据历史事件数据评估自身的置信度，考虑其对证据的评估强度。然后，模型审核由预测器生成的根本原因。然后，优化步骤将这些评估结合起来确定最终的置信度估计。",
