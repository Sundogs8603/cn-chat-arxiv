    "translated_abstract": "由于对其他智能体的信息有限，确保动态多智能体系统的安全性是具有挑战性的。控制屏障函数（CBFs）在安全保证方面显示出了潜力，但当前方法对其他智能体做出了很强的假设，并且常常依赖手动调整以平衡安全性、可行性和性能。在这项工作中，我们深入研究了带有CBF的多智能体系统的自适应安全学习问题。我们展示了CBF配置如何深刻影响新兴行为，凸显了对CBF设计进行响应式和动态方法的必要性。我们提出了ASRL，一种全新的自适应安全强化学习框架，通过强化学习完全自动优化策略和CBF系数，增强安全性和长期性能。通过直接与其他智能体进行交互，ASRL学会了应对不同的智能体行为，并将成本违规保持在所需的限制之下。我们在多机器人系统和竞争中评估了ASRL。",
