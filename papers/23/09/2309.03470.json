    "abstract": "I explore two questions in this thesis: how can computer science be used to fight human trafficking? And how can computer vision create a sense of touch?  I use natural language processing (NLP) to monitor the United States illicit massage industry (IMI), a multi-billion dollar industry that offers not just therapeutic massages but also commercial sexual services. Employees of this industry are often immigrant women with few job opportunities, leaving them vulnerable to fraud, coercion, and other facets of human trafficking. Monitoring spatiotemporal trends helps prevent trafficking in the IMI. By creating datasets with three publicly-accessible websites: Google Places, Rubmaps, and AMPReviews, combined with NLP techniques such as bag-of-words and Word2Vec, I show how to derive insights into the labor pressures and language barriers that employees face, as well as the income, demographics, and societal pressures affecting sex buyers. I include a call-to-action to other researchers give",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我探讨了两个问题：计算机科学如何用于打击人口贩卖？计算机视觉如何创建触觉感知？我使用自然语言处理（NLP）监控美国的非法按摩业（IMI），这是一个价值数十亿美元的行业，不仅提供治疗性按摩，还提供商业性服务。该行业的员工通常是少有工作机会的移民妇女，容易受到欺诈、胁迫和其他人口贩卖问题的影响。监测空间时间趋势有助于预防非法按摩业中的人口贩卖。通过创建包括Google Places、Rubmaps和AMPReviews等三个可公开访问的网站的数据集，结合诸如词袋和Word2Vec等NLP技术，我展示了如何洞察员工面临的劳动压力和语言障碍，以及影响购买性服务者的收入、人口统计和社会压力。我呼吁其他研究人员行动起来。",
