    "abstract": "Given a set of points labeled with $k$ labels, we introduce the heat map sorting problem as reordering and merging the points and dimensions while preserving the clusters (labels). A cluster is preserved if it remains connected, i.e., if it is not split into several clusters and no two clusters are merged.  We prove the problem is NP-hard and we give a fixed-parameter algorithm with a constant number of rounds in the massively parallel computation model, where each machine has a sublinear memory and the total memory of the machines is linear. We give an approximation algorithm for a NP-hard special case of the problem. We empirically compare our algorithm with k-means and density-based clustering (DBSCAN) using a dimensionality reduction via locality-sensitive hashing on several directed and undirected graphs of email and computer networks.",

    "translated_abstract": "给定具有$k$个标签的点集，我们将热图排序问题定义为在保留簇（标签）的同时重新排列和合并点和维度。如果一个簇保持连通，即没有被分裂成多个簇且没有两个簇被合并，则称该簇被保留。我们证明了该问题是NP-hard的，并在高度并行计算模型中提供了一个有固定次数轮的固定参数算法，其中每个机器具有亚线性内存，总内存为线性。对于问题的NP-hard特殊情况，我们提供了一个近似算法。我们通过局部敏感哈希的降维方法，基于电子邮件和计算机网络的有向和无向图，经验性地将我们的算法与k-means和基于密度的聚类（DBSCAN）进行了比较。",
