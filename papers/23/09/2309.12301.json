    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of robust novelty detection, where we aim to detect novelties in terms of semantic content while being invariant to changes in other, irrelevant factors. Specifically, we operate in a setup with multiple environments, where we determine the set of features that are associated more with the environments, rather than to the content relevant for the task. Thus, we propose a method that starts with a pretrained embedding and a multi-env setup and manages to rank the features based on their environment-focus. First, we compute a per-feature score based on the feature distribution variance between envs. Next, we show that by dropping the highly scored ones, we manage to remove spurious correlations and improve the overall performance by up to 6%, both in covariance and sub-population shift cases, both for a real and a synthetic benchmark, that we introduce for this task.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了鲁棒性新颖性检测的问题，在该问题中，我们旨在检测语义内容方面的新颖性，同时对其他无关因素的变化具有不变性。具体来说，我们在具有多个环境的设置中操作，确定与环境更相关而不是任务相关内容的特征集合。因此，我们提出了一种方法，该方法从预训练的嵌入和多环境设置开始，成功根据其环境关注度对特征进行排序。首先，我们基于环境之间的特征分布方差计算每个特征的得分。接下来，我们证明通过舍弃得分较高的特征，我们可以去除虚假的相关性，并在正态协方差和子种群转移的情况下提高整体性能，无论是对于真实的还是对于我们为此任务引入的合成基准数据。",
