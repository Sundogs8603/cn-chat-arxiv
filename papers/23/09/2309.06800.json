    "translated_abstract": "交通预测是一个重要的课题，因为它在交通领域有广泛的应用。近期，许多研究取得了很好的结果。然而，大多数研究假设预测位置有完整或至少部分的历史记录，不能扩展到无历史记录的位置。在现实场景中，由于预算限制和安装可行性问题，传感器的部署可能受限，这使得大多数当前模型不适用。虽然少数文献尝试在缺失位置上插补交通状态，但这些方法需要与传感器位置同时观测的数据，使它们不适用于预测任务。另一个缺点是缺乏对预测不确定性的测量，使得之前的工作不适用于风险敏感的任务或涉及决策的情况。为了填补这一空白，受到先前的归纳图神经网络的启发，本文提出了一种考虑不确定性的方法。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一种考虑不确定性的交通预测方法，可以处理缺失数据和测量不确定性，并适用于风险敏感任务和决策导向问题。"
