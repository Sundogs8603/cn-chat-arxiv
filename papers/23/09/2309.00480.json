    "translated_abstract": "全球导航卫星系统（GNSS）在交通系统中对于精确和一致的车辆定位至关重要。然而，在城市峡谷等复杂环境中，由于多路径效应和非直达（NLOS）接收的影响，GNSS观测可以产生扭曲。在这种情况下，传统的分类与排除错误GNSS观测的方法可能会失败，导致不可靠的状态估计和不安全的系统操作。本研究提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，通过将GNSS观测视为空时建模问题，检测NLOS接收并预测GNSS伪距误差。与先前的工作相比，我们构建了一个类似Transformer的注意机制，增强了长短期记忆（LSTM）网络，提高了模型的性能和普适性。对于所提出的网络的训练和评估，我们使用了香港和亚琛的标记数据集。我们还介绍了一个数据集生成过程来标记...",
