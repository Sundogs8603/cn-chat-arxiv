To reduce the time for uplink data collection while balancing the trade-off between reconstruction quality and computational energy cost, we propose a hybrid action reinforcement learning (RL) framework to make decisions on semantic model scale, channel allocation, transmission power, and UAV trajectory. The variables are classified into discrete type and continuous type, which are optimized by two different RL agents to generate the combined action. Simulation results indicate that the proposed hybrid action reinforcement learning framework can effectively improve the efficiency of uplink semantic data collection under different parameter settings and outperforms the benchmark scenarios.",
