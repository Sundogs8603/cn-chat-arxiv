    "translated_abstract": "事件相机是受生物系统启发的传感器，专门用于捕捉亮度变化。这些新兴相机相比传统的基于帧的相机具有许多优势，包括高动态范围、高帧率和极低的功耗。由于这些优点，事件相机越来越多地被应用于帧插值、语义分割、里程计和SLAM等各个领域。然而，事件相机在虚拟现实应用的三维重建方面的应用还不够深入。以前在这个领域的方法主要集中在通过深度图估计进行三维重建上。产生稠密三维重建的方法通常需要多个相机，而利用单个事件相机只能产生半稠密的结果。其他可以产生稠密三维重建的单目相机方法依赖于创建一个流水线，其中要么结合前述方法，要么结合其他现有的运动结构（SfM）或多视图方法。",
