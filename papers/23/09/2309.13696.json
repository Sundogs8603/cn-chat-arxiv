    "abstract": "Designing an optimum portfolio for allocating suitable weights to its constituent assets so that the return and risk associated with the portfolio are optimized is a computationally hard problem. The seminal work of Markowitz that attempted to solve the problem by estimating the future returns of the stocks is found to perform sub-optimally on real-world stock market data. This is because the estimation task becomes extremely challenging due to the stochastic and volatile nature of stock prices. This work illustrates three approaches to portfolio design minimizing the risk, optimizing the risk, and assigning equal weights to the stocks of a portfolio. Thirteen critical sectors listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are first chosen. Three portfolios are designed following the above approaches choosing the top ten stocks from each sector based on their free-float market capitalization. The portfolios are designed using the historical prices of the stocks from Jan 1, 2017, ",

    "translated_abstract": "设计一个最优投资组合，为其组成资产分配合适的权重，以优化投资组合的回报和风险，是一个计算难题。马科维茨的开创性工作试图通过估计股票的未来回报来解决这个问题，但在真实世界的股票市场数据上表现不佳。这是因为由于股票价格的随机性和波动性，估计任务变得极具挑战性。本研究通过最小化风险、优化风险和给股票分配相等权重三种方法，阐述了投资组合设计的三种方法。首先选择了印度国家股票交易所（NSE）上列出的十三个重要行业。根据自由流通市值，从每个行业选择前十只股票，设计了三个投资组合。利用2017年1月1日至今的股票历史价格进行设计。",
