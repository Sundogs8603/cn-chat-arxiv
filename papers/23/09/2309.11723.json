    "abstract": "The strategy for selecting candidate sets -- the set of items that the recommendation system is expected to rank for each user -- is an important decision in carrying out an offline top-$N$ recommender system evaluation. The set of candidates is composed of the union of the user's test items and an arbitrary number of non-relevant items that we refer to as decoys. Previous studies have aimed to understand the effect of different candidate set sizes and selection strategies on evaluation. In this paper, we extend this knowledge by studying the specific interaction of candidate set selection strategies with popularity bias, and use simulation to assess whether sampled candidate sets result in metric estimates that are less biased with respect to the true metric values under complete data that is typically unavailable in ordinary experiments.",

    "translated_abstract": "在离线的Top-N推荐系统评估中，选择候选集的策略是一个重要决策。候选集是由用户的测试物品和一定数量的非相关物品（我们称之为诱饵物品）的并集组成。先前的研究旨在理解不同候选集大小和选择策略对评估的影响。在本文中，我们通过研究候选集选择策略与流行度偏差的特定交互，并使用模拟评估抽样的候选集是否导致度量估计对于通常在实验中不可用的完整数据更少地存在偏差。",
