    "translated_abstract": "提供攻击（伪冒）检测（PAD）通常与生物特征验证同时操作以提高在面对伪冒攻击时的可靠性。尽管这两个子系统同时作用于可靠的生物特征验证的单一任务，但它们解决不同的检测任务，因此通常被分开评估。证据表明，这种方法是次优的。我们引入了一种新的指标，用于在与生物特征验证同时操作的情况下联合评估PAD解决方案。与最近提出的串联检测成本函数相反，新的串联等误差率（t-EER）是无参数的。然而，两个分类器的组合导致了一组工作点，在这些工作点上，误报和漏报率是相等的，也取决于攻击的普遍程度。因此，我们引入了“并发”的t-EER，这是一个与攻击的普遍程度无关的独特工作点。利用模态（甚至应用）的一致性，我们显示了t-EER的实用性和性能优势。",
