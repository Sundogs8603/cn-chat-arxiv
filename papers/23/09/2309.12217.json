Approach: We use a problem transformation approach, in which actions were subset into two biomechanically independent components - a set of wrist directions and a set of finger modifiers. To maintain fast calibration time, we train models for each component using only individual gestures, and extrapolate to the full product space of combination gestures by generating synthetic data. We collected a supervised dataset with high-confidence ground truth labels in which subjects performed combination gestures while holding a joystick, and conducted experiments to analyze the impact of model architectures, classifier algorithms, and synthetic data generation strategies on the performance of the proposed approach.

    "translated_abstract": "目标：本研究旨在有效提高基于肌电信号的手势识别系统的表达能力。方法：我们采用问题转换的方法，将动作分为两个生物力学独立的组成部分——一组手腕方向和一组手指修饰器。为了保持快速校准时间，我们仅使用单个手势训练每个组件的模型，并通过生成合成数据来外推到组合手势的完整产品空间。我们收集了一个有高置信度标签的监督式数据集，其中受试者在持有游戏手柄的同时进行组合手势，并进行实验分析所提出方法的模型架构、分类器算法和合成数据生成策略对性能的影响。主要结果：我们发现，在并行模型架构和非线性分类器的问题转换方法中，使用合成数据生成策略可以显著提高性能。",
