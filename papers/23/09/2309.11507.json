    "translated_abstract": "在数字广告中，最佳推荐项目（推荐项）的选择和最佳创意展示（创意优化）传统上被认为是不同的学科。然而，两者对用户满意度都有显著贡献，这是基于我们的假设，即它们依赖于项目的相关性和展示方式，尤其是在视觉创意的情况下。为此，我们引入了“生成创意优化（GCO）”的任务，该任务提出使用生成模型进行创意生成，这些模型可以结合用户的兴趣，以及基于稳定扩散外景架构的“AdBooster”，这是一个用于个性化广告创意的模型。该模型在微调和生成时都可以独特地结合用户的兴趣。为了进一步提高AdBooster的性能，我们还引入了一个自动数据增强流程。通过在模拟数据上进行实验，我们验证了AdBooster在生成更多精彩创意方面的有效性。",
