In practice the continuous-time framework of stochastic control may be undesirable for various business reasons. In this work we present a straightforward approach for thinking of cross-asset portfolio risk management and hedging, providing some implementation details, while rarely venturing outside the convex optimisation setting of (approximate) quadratic programming~(QP). We pay particular attention to the correspondence between the economic concepts and their mathematical representations; the abstractions enabling us to handle multiple asset classes and risk models at once; the dimensional analysis of the resulting equations; and the assumptions inherent in our derivations.

    "translated_abstract": "在学术文献中，投资组合风险管理和对冲通常通过连续时间的随机控制和Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman~(HJB)方程的语言来阐述。然而，在实践中，连续时间框架的随机控制可能由于各种商业原因而不可取。在本文中，我们提出了一种简单的方法来思考跨资产投资组合风险管理和对冲，提供了一些实施细节，同时很少涉足（近似）二次规划~(QP)的凸优化设置之外。我们特别关注经济概念与数学表示之间的对应关系；使我们能够同时处理多个资产类别和风险模型的抽象；产生方程的尺寸分析；以及我们推导中的假设。我们展示了如何使用CVXOPT求解所得到的QP问题。",
