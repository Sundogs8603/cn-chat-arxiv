    "abstract": "The wide-spread use of social networks has given rise to subjective, misleading, and even false information on the Internet. Thus, subjectivity detection can play an important role in ensuring the objectiveness and the quality of a piece of information. This paper presents the solution built by the Gpachov team for the CLEF-2023 CheckThat! lab Task~2 on subjectivity detection. Three different research directions are explored. The first one is based on fine-tuning a sentence embeddings encoder model and dimensionality reduction. The second one explores a sample-efficient few-shot learning model. The third one evaluates fine-tuning a multilingual transformer on an altered dataset, using data from multiple languages. Finally, the three approaches are combined in a simple majority voting ensemble, resulting in 0.77 macro F1 on the test set and achieving 2nd place on the English subtask.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交网络的广泛使用导致了互联网上的主观、误导甚至虚假信息的出现。因此，主观性检测在确保信息客观性和质量方面扮演着重要角色。本文介绍了Gpachov团队针对CLEF-2023 CheckThat！实验室任务2的主观性检测构建的解决方案。文章探索了三个不同的研究方向。第一个方向基于微调句子嵌入编码模型和降维。第二个方向探索了一种样本高效的少样本学习模型。第三个方向评估了在经过修改的数据集上微调多语言转换器，使用了多种语言的数据。最后，将这三种方法以简单的多数投票集成，结果在测试集上达到了0.77的宏F1，并在英语子任务上取得了第二名。",
