    "abstract": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) imposes a player salary cap. It is therefore useful to develop tools to measure the relative realized return of a player's salary given their on court performance. Very few such studies exist, however. We thus present the first known framework to estimate a return on investment (ROI) for NBA player contracts. The framework operates in five parts: (1) decide on a measurement time horizon, such as the standard 82-game NBA regular season; (2) calculate the novel game contribution percentage (GCP) measure we propose, which is a single game summary statistic that sums to unity for each competing team and is comprised of traditional, playtype, hustle, box outs, defensive, tracking, and rebounding per game NBA statistics; (3) estimate the single game value (SGV) of each regular season NBA game using a standard currency conversion calculation; (4) multiply the SGV by the vector of realized GCPs to obtain a series of realized per-player single season ca",

    "translated_abstract": "国家篮球协会（NBA）规定了球员薪资上限。因此，开发工具以衡量球员在场上表现下的薪资回报相对实现是很有用的。然而，很少有这样的研究存在。因此，我们提出了首个已知的用于估算NBA球员合同回报率（ROI）的框架。该框架由五个部分组成：（1）确定一个测量时间段，如标准的82场NBA常规赛季；（2）计算我们提出的新的比赛贡献率（GCP）度量，它是一个用于每个竞争队的单场比赛总结统计，由传统、打法、奋斗、盒子收球、防守、追踪和篮板等NBA比赛统计数据组成，总和为1；（3）使用标准的货币换算计算估计每场常规赛NBA比赛的单场价值（SGV）；（4）将SGV与实现的GCP向量相乘，得到一系列实现的每个球员单个赛季的财经产值。",
