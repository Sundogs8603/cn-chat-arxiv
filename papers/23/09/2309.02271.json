This paper investigates how U.S. importers reacted to the trade war and worldwide lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our findings uncover intricate trading dynamics among the U.S., China, and Southeast Asia, through which businesses relocated portions of their global supply chain away from China to avoid high tariffs.

    "translated_abstract": "自2018年以来，美中贸易紧张局势导致全球最大两个经济体的稳步脱钩。2020年爆发的疫情进一步加剧了这一过程，并带来了许多意想不到的后果。本文调查了美国进口商对贸易战和COVID-19大流行的反应。我们分别对这两个事件对美国进口的影响进行了研究，包括各种经济范围。我们的研究揭示了美国、中国和东南亚之间复杂的贸易动态，通过这些动态，企业将全球供应链的一部分从中国转移到其他地方以避免高关税。我们的分析表明，提高关税会导致美国从中国进口的减少。与此同时，东南亚出口商通过更多地参与产品的组装和完成，更多地整合到以中国供应商为中心的价值链中。然而，全球疫情封锁扭转了这一趋势，因为...（待续）",
