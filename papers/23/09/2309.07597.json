    "abstract": "We introduce C-Pack, a package of resources that significantly advance the field of general Chinese embeddings. C-Pack includes three critical resources. 1) C-MTEB is a comprehensive benchmark for Chinese text embeddings covering 6 tasks and 35 datasets. 2) C-MTP is a massive text embedding dataset curated from labeled and unlabeled Chinese corpora for training embedding models. 3) C-TEM is a family of embedding models covering multiple sizes. Our models outperform all prior Chinese text embeddings on C-MTEB by up to +10% upon the time of the release. We also integrate and optimize the entire suite of training methods for C-TEM. Along with our resources on general Chinese embedding, we release our data and models for English text embeddings. The English models achieve state-of-the-art performance on MTEB benchmark; meanwhile, our released English data is 2 times larger than the Chinese data. All these resources are made publicly available at https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了C-Pack，这是一套显著推进普通汉语嵌入领域的资源。C-Pack包括三个关键资源。1）C-MTEB是一个涵盖6个任务和35个数据集的全面汉语文本嵌入基准。2）C-MTP是一个从标记和未标记的汉语语料库中策划的大规模文本嵌入数据集，用于训练嵌入模型。3）C-TEM是一个涵盖多个尺寸的嵌入模型系列。我们的模型在C-MTEB上的表现优于之前的所有汉语文本嵌入达到了发布时的最高+10%。我们还整合和优化了C-TEM的整套训练方法。除了我们关于普通汉语嵌入的资源外，我们还发布了我们的英语文本嵌入数据和模型。这些英语模型在MTEB基准上实现了最先进的性能；与此同时，我们发布的英语数据比汉语数据大2倍。所有这些资源都可以在https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding上公开获取。",
