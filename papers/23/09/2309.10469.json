    "translated_abstract": "在线推荐系统旨在将用户需求与各种平台上的大量资源匹配。一个关键挑战是在数据稀疏的条件下准确建模用户偏好。为了解决这个挑战，一些方法利用来自多个平台的外部用户行为数据来丰富用户表示。然而，所有这些方法都需要一个跨平台的一致用户ID，并且忽略了类似用户的信息。本研究提出了RUEL，一种新颖的基于检索的序列推荐系统，可以有效地将来自Edge浏览器日志的外部匿名用户行为数据融入推荐。我们首先收集和预处理了一年的大量Edge浏览器日志，并将它们与推荐数据集中的候选项相对应的目标实体进行关联。然后，我们设计了一个对比学习框架，其中包括一个动量编码器和一个记忆库，用于检索最相关和最多样化的浏览器日志。",
