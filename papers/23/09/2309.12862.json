    "translated_abstract": "在传统的Transformer模型中，出现了一种新兴的基于稀疏交互的注意力机制，这种机制与生物原理更为接近。包括Set Transformer和Perceiver在内的方法采用了与有限能力的潜在空间相结合的交叉注意力机制。基于最近对全局工作空间理论和关联记忆的神经科学研究，我们提出了关联变换器（AiT）。AiT引入了低秩显式记忆，既可以作为先验来指导共享工作空间的瓶颈注意力，又可以作为关联记忆的吸引子。通过联合端到端训练，这些先验自然地发展出模块的特化，每个模块对形成注意力瓶颈的归纳偏好有所贡献。瓶颈可以促进输入之间为将信息写入内存而进行竞争。我们展示了AiT是一种稀疏表示学习器。",
