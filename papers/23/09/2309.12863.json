    "translated_abstract": "神经机器翻译（NMT）在训练大规模语料库时展示出了令人印象深刻的性能。然而，通用的NMT系统在领域外的翻译中表现出了较差的性能。为了缓解这个问题，最近提出了几种领域适应方法，通常比通用的NMT系统有更好的翻译质量。尽管在NMT的英语和其他欧洲语言方面取得了一些持续的进展，但在阿拉伯语方面的领域适应在文献中受到了很少的关注。因此，本研究旨在探索阿拉伯机器翻译（AMT）领域特定适应的有效性，尤其是在尚未开发的领域中，如金融新闻文章。为此，我们精心开发了一个用于阿拉伯-英语（AR-EN）金融领域翻译的平行语料库，以评估不同领域适应方法的性能。我们还在我们的数据集上对几个预训练的NMT和大型语言模型进行了微调，包括ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo。结果表明，",
