    "translated_abstract": "强化学习因其能够从以往经验中学习并做出自适应决策的能力，在监控应用中越来越被应用。然而，现有的基于机器学习的健康监控应用大多是基于监督学习算法，训练标签数据，无法在不确定的复杂环境中做出自适应决策。本研究提出了一种新颖的通用系统，即具有多个强化学习智能体的预测深度强化学习（PDRL），应用于时间序列预测环境。该提出的通用框架可以容纳虚拟深度 Q 网络（DQN）智能体，以监测复杂环境的预测未来状态，并根据明确定义的奖励策略使智能体在最大化奖励的同时学习现有知识。在评估该框架的过程中，部署了三个强化学习智能体以监测通过 BiLSTM 模型预测的受试者未来的心率、呼吸率和体温。随着每次迭代，智能体根据实际反馈调整其行为策略。",
