    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了针对IT基础设施的自动化入侵应对，并将攻击者和防御者之间的交互形式建模为部分观测的随机游戏。为了解决这个游戏，我们采用了一种方法，攻击和防御策略通过强化学习和自我对弈进行协同演化，以达到平衡。之前的研究中提出的解决方案证明了这种方法对于小型基础设施的可行性，但面对实际情境由于基础设施规模的指数级增长而无法扩展。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种将游戏递归分解成可以并行解决的子游戏的方法。应用最优停止理论，我们证明了这些子游戏中的最佳响应策略具有阈值结构，这允许我们高效地计算它们。为了解决分解的游戏，我们提出了一个名为Decompositional Fictitious Self-Play (DFSP) 的算法，通过随机自我对弈学习纳什均衡。",
