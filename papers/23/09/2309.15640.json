    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种在金融市场受金融动荡影响时对冲风险资产组合的新方法。我们引入了一种全新的多元算法投资策略（AIS）的分散化方法，该方法不是在单个资产的级别上进行，而是在基于这些资产的价格的级别上进行。我们采用四种不同的理论模型（LSTM - 长短期记忆、ARIMA-GARCH - 自回归移动平均 - 广义自回归条件异方差、动量和反向交易）来生成价格预测，然后利用这些预测产生单个和复合的AIS的投资信号。通过这种方式，我们能够验证由各种资产（能源商品、贵金属、加密货币或软商品）组成的不同类型的投资策略在对冲用于股票指数（S&P 500指数）的组合AIS中的多样化潜力。",
