    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在没有中央服务器的分散设置下处理一类非光滑强凸-强凹鞍点问题。为了解决这一类问题的共识形式，我们开发了一种不精确的原始对偶杂交梯度（不精确PDHG）过程，允许通用的梯度计算预言更新原始变量和对偶变量。我们首先研究了带有随机方差减少梯度（SVRG）预言的不精确PDHG的性能。我们的数值研究揭示了IPDHG与SVRG预言迭代的初始保守进展现象。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个简单而有效的切换思想，在初始更新阶段使用广义随机梯度（GSG）计算预言来加速迭代的进展到鞍点解，然后在适当时刻切换到SVRG预言。我们提出的算法命名为分散近端切换随机梯度",
