    "translated_abstract": "在医疗保健中，针对复杂的多发病条件进行有效的药物推荐是一项关键任务。大多数现有的工作基于纵向记录预测药物，这种方法假设学习纵向序列数据的信息传输模式是稳定的，并且病患在就诊期间的医疗事件是有序的。然而，他们忽视了以下条件：1）急需一种更紧凑的内部病患就诊事件关系编码器；2）学习病人可变纵向序列的准确表示的策略是不同的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的适应样本的层次药物预测网络，称为SHAPE，来解决药物推荐任务中的上述挑战。具体来说，我们设计了一个紧凑的内部病患就诊事件关系编码器，用于获得就诊级别的表示，并且发展了一个纵向病历编码器，以学习患者的纵向序列表示。",
