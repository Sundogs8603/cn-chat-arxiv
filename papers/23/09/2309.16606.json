    "translated_abstract": "AI更高的期望通过安慰剂效应促进了人机交互的表现。降低期望来控制安慰剂效应是明智的，但过于负面的期望可能导致负安慰剂效应。在一个字母辨识任务中，我们告知参与者AI会通过调整界面来增强或降低他们的表现，但实际上，在任何条件下都没有AI存在。贝叶斯分析显示，参与者期望值很高，并且不管AI的描述如何，当一个虚假的AI存在时，他们的表现都更好。通过认知建模，我们可以追溯到参与者收集更多信息从而获得优势。一项复制研究验证了负面AI描述不会改变期望值，这表明AI的表现期望在负面言语描述下是有偏差且稳定的。我们讨论了用户期望对于AI交互和评估的影响，并提供了行为安慰剂的证据。",
