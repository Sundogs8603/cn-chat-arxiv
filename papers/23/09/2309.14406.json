We expand upon this result and identify a speedup utilizing Grover's algorithm in the kernel of a support vector machine. To show the practicality of the kernel structure we apply it to a problem related to pattern matching, providing a practical yet provable advantage. Moreover, we show that combining quantum computation in a preprocessing step with classical methods for classification further improves classifier performance.",
