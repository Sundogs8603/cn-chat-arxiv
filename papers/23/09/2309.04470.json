    "translated_abstract": "在社会影响领域，预测未来结果是机器学习的常见应用。例子从预测教育中学生的成功到预测医疗保健中的疾病风险。从实践者来看，最终目标不仅仅是预测，而是有效地行动。越来越多的证据表明，仅仅依靠结果预测进行下游干预可能不会产生预期结果。在大多数领域中，每个个体存在多种可能的干预措施，这使得采取有效行动的挑战更加严峻。即使连接个体潜在状态与结果的因果机制已经很好地理解，在任何给定的实例（特定的学生或患者）中，实践者仍然需要从预算测量的潜在状态中推断出哪种可能的干预措施对这个个体最有效。考虑到这一点，我们想问：准确的结果预测何时有助于识别最合适的干预措施？",
