    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于自然语言处理（NLP）的方法，用于研究欧洲议会中利益集团（游说团体）在立法过程中的影响力。我们收集和分析了游说团体的立场文件和议员的讲话，通过比较这些文本的语义相似性和蕴含关系，我们能够发现议员和游说团体之间的可解释联系。在缺乏这种联系的真实数据集的情况下，我们通过将发现的联系与我们策划的一份关于议员和游说团体之间转发链接的数据集以及议员公开披露的会议进行间接验证。我们的最佳方法达到了0.77的AUC分数，并且比几个基准方法表现得更好。此外，对于发现的链接进行的综合分析，涉及相关游说团体和议员的政治团体，与这些团体的意识形态的预期相一致（例如，中左翼团体）。",

By comparing the position papers of lobbies and speeches made by MEPs, interpretable links between MEPs and lobbies are discovered and validated. The research findings demonstrate that this method accurately reveals the relationships between MEPs and lobbies, which is crucial for understanding the impact of lobbying in the legislative process."
