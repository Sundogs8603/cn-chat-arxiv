Despite this success, these models can learn, perpetuate, and amplify harmful social biases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of bias evaluation and mitigation techniques for LLMs. We first consolidate, formalize, and expand notions of social bias and fairness in natural language processing, defining distinct facets of harm and introducing several desiderata to operationalize fairness for LLMs. We then unify the literature by proposing three intuitive taxonomies, two for bias evaluation, namely metrics and datasets, and one for mitigation. Our first taxonomy of metrics for bias evaluation disambiguates the relationship between metrics and evaluation datasets, and organizes metrics by the different levels at which t",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展使得人们能够处理、理解和生成类似人类文本，逐渐融入触及我们社交领域的系统。然而，尽管取得成功，这些模型可能学习、延续和放大有害的社会偏见。本文对LLMs的偏见评估和缓解技术进行了全面调查。我们首先整合、形式化和扩展自然语言处理中社会偏见和公平性的概念，定义了伤害的不同方面，并引入了几个实现LLMs公平性的必要条件。然后，我们通过提出三个直观的分类体系统一了文献，其中包括两个用于偏见评估的分类体系，即指标和数据集，以及一个用于缓解的分类体系。",
