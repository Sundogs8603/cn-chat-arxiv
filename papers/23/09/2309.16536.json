Determining whether or not a patient has EoE can be an arduous process and any medical imaging approaches used to assist diagnosis must consider both efficiency and precision. We propose an improvement of Adorno et al's approach for quantifying eosinphils using deep image segmentation. Our new approach leverages Monte Carlo Dropout, a common approach in deep learning to reduce overfitting, to provide uncertainty quantification on current deep learning models. The uncertainty can be visualized in an output image to evaluate model performance, provide insight to how deep learning algorithms function, and assist pathologists in identifying eosinophils.",

    "translated_abstract": "嗜酸性食管炎（EoE）是一种日益普及的过敏性疾病。为了诊断EoE，病理学家必须在一个高倍视场（400倍放大率）内找到15个或更多的嗜酸性粒细胞。确定一个患者是否患有EoE可以是一个艰巨的过程，并且用于辅助诊断的任何医学成像方法都必须考虑效率和精确性。我们提出了一种改进Adorno等人对使用深度图像分割进行嗜酸性粒细胞定量的方法。我们的新方法利用了蒙特卡洛辍学（Monte Carlo Dropout），这是深度学习中常用的一种减少过拟合的方法，用于对当前深度学习模型进行不确定性量化。不确定性可以在输出图像中可视化，以评估模型性能，理解深度学习算法的工作原理，并帮助病理学家识别嗜酸性粒细胞。",
