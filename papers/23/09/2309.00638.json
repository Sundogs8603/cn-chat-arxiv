    "translated_abstract": "在金融市场中开发一个逼真的订单流生成模型是一个具有挑战性的开放问题，具有许多市场参与者的应用。为解决这个问题，我们提出了第一个端到端的自回归生成模型，可以生成令牌化的限价订单簿(LOB)消息。这些消息由Jax-LOB模拟器解释，该模拟器更新LOB状态。为了高效处理长序列，该模型使用简化的结构化状态空间层来处理订单簿状态和令牌化消息的序列。利用NASDAQ股票LOBSTER数据，我们开发了一种自定义的消息数据分词器，将连续数字分组转换为令牌，类似于大型语言模型中的分词。外样本结果表明，在逼近数据分布方面，模型的困惑度较低，性能表现有前景。此外，从生成的订单流计算出的中间价格回报与数据呈显著相关性，表明了模型的潜在优势。",
