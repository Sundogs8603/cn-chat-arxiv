    "abstract": "Natural-language dialog is key for intuitive human-robot interaction. It can be used not only to express humans' intents, but also to communicate instructions for improvement if a robot does not understand a command correctly. Of great importance is to endow robots with the ability to learn from such interaction experience in an incremental way to allow them to improve their behaviors or avoid mistakes in the future. In this paper, we propose a system to achieve incremental learning of complex behavior from natural interaction, and demonstrate its implementation on a humanoid robot. Building on recent advances, we present a system that deploys Large Language Models (LLMs) for high-level orchestration of the robot's behavior, based on the idea of enabling the LLM to generate Python statements in an interactive console to invoke both robot perception and action. The interaction loop is closed by feeding back human instructions, environment observations, and execution results to the LLM, ",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言对话对于直观的人机交互至关重要。它不仅可以用来表达人类的意图，而且还可以用来传达指令以改进机器人对命令的理解。非常重要的是要赋予机器人从这种交互经验中增量学习的能力，以使它们能够改进自己的行为或避免未来的错误。本文提出了一个从自然互动中实现复杂行为增量学习的系统，并在一个人形机器人上演示其实现。基于最新的进展，我们提出了一个使用大型语言模型（Large Language Models，LLMs）进行机器人行为的高层协调的系统，这个系统的思想是让LLM在交互式控制台中生成Python语句来调用机器人的感知和动作。通过将人类指令、环境观测和执行结果反馈给LLM来关闭交互循环。",
