    "abstract": "In this study, we leveraged machine learning techniques to identify risk factors associated with post-COVID-19 mental health disorders. Our analysis, based on data collected from 669 patients across various provinces in Iraq, yielded valuable insights. We found that age, gender, and geographical region of residence were significant demographic factors influencing the likelihood of developing mental health disorders in post-COVID-19 patients. Additionally, comorbidities and the severity of COVID-19 illness were important clinical predictors. Psychosocial factors, such as social support, coping strategies, and perceived stress levels, also played a substantial role. Our findings emphasize the complex interplay of multiple factors in the development of mental health disorders following COVID-19 recovery. Healthcare providers and policymakers should consider these risk factors when designing targeted interventions and support systems for individuals at risk. Machine learning-based approach",

    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们利用机器学习技术识别了与COVID-19后精神健康障碍相关的风险因素。通过对伊拉克各省669名患者的数据分析，我们获得了有价值的洞见。我们发现年龄、性别和居住地地理区域是影响COVID-19后患者发展精神健康障碍可能性的重要人口统计因素。此外，合并症和COVID-19疾病的严重程度也是重要的临床预测因子。心理社会因素，如社会支持、应对策略和主观压力水平，也起到了重要作用。我们的发现强调了COVID-19康复后精神健康障碍发展中多个因素的复杂相互作用。医疗服务提供者和政策制定者在制定针对患者的有针对性干预和支持系统时应考虑这些风险因素。基于机器学习的方法",
