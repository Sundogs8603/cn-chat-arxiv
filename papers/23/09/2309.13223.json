    "translated_abstract": "尽管基本前提是下一代无线网络（例如6G）将是人工智能（AI）本地化的，但到目前为止，大多数现有的工作仍然要么是定性的，要么是对现有“AI用于无线”范式的增量扩展。实际上，创建AI本地化的无线网络面临着重要的技术挑战，因为数据驱动型、训练密集型的AI的局限性。这些限制包括AI模型的黑匣子特性、它们的曲线拟合特性（这可能限制它们的推理和适应能力）、它们对大量训练数据的依赖以及大型神经网络的能量效率低下等。作为对这些限制的回应，本文提出了一个全面的、具有前瞻性的愿景，通过引入一个基于因果推理的新框架来解决这些缺点。该框架基于因果发现、因果表示学习和因果推断。",
