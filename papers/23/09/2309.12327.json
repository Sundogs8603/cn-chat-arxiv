    "translated_abstract": "负责任的人工智能开发的核心目标之一是确保高质量的训练数据集。许多研究者指出了注释步骤在创建高质量数据时的重要性，但对于使数据注释成为可能的工作却付出了较少的关注。我们将这个工作定义为真实性架构的设计，并探讨在创建医学领域的数据集之前所涉及的挑战。基于在三个卫生技术组织中的广泛工作，我们描述了影响医学数据集创建过程的五个外部和内部因素。三个外部因素包括法规限制、创建和使用的上下文以及商业和运营压力。这些因素影响医学数据采集，并形成真实性架构的设计。两个内部因素包括认识差异和标记的局限性。这些直接塑造了真实性架构的设计。关于什么构成了真实性架构的讨论。",
