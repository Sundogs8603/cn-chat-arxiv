To remedy the aforementioned issues, we release PyGraft, a Python-based tool that generates highly customized, domain-agnostic schemas and knowledge graphs.

    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱（KG）已经成为一种重要的数据表示和管理范式。KG通常基于模式（例如本体论）来捕获事实信息和上下文知识。在某些任务中，一些KG已经成为标准的基准测试数据集。然而，最近的研究发现，仅依赖有限的数据集合是不足以评估方法的泛化能力的。在一些数据敏感领域，如教育或医学，公共数据集的获取更加有限。为了解决上述问题，我们发布了PyGraft，一个基于Python的工具，用于生成高度定制的、与领域无关的模式和知识图谱。合成的模式包括各种RDFS和OWL构造，而合成的KG则模拟了真实KG的特性和规模。通过运行描述逻辑（DL）推理器，最终确保生成资源的逻辑一致性。",
