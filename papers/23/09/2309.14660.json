    "translated_abstract": "图像到点云（I2P）注册是机器人导航和移动建图领域中的一项基础任务。现有的I2P注册方法在点到像素级别上估计对应关系，忽略了全局对齐。然而，没有来自全局约束的高级引导的I2P匹配容易收敛到局部最优解。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种新的I2P注册网络CoFiI2P，通过粗到精的方式提取对应关系，以得到全局最优解。首先，将图像和点云输入到一个共享编码-解码网络中进行层次化特征提取。然后，设计了一个粗到精的匹配模块，利用特征建立稳健的特征对应关系。具体来说，在粗匹配块中，采用了一种新型的I2P变换模块，从图像和点云中捕捉同质和异质的全局信息。通过判别描述子，完成粗-细特征匹配过程。最后，通过细化匹配模块进一步提升对应关系的准确性。",
