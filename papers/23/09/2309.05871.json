    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种通过随机图着色来设计差分隐私(DP)机制的新框架，称为彩虹差分隐私。在这个框架中，数据集是图中的节点，两个相邻的数据集通过边相连。图中的每个数据集都有一种对机制可能的输出的偏好排序，这些排序被称为彩虹。不同的彩虹将相连的数据集图分割成不同的区域。我们证明，如果在这些区域边界处的DP机制被固定，并且它在所有具有相同彩虹边界的数据集上的行为相同，那么存在一个唯一的最优$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP机制(只要边界条件有效)并且可以用闭形式表示出来。我们的证明技巧基于优势排序和DP之间的有趣关系，适用于任意有限数量的颜色和$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP，改进了先前只适用于至多三种颜色的结果。",
