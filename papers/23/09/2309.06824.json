    "translated_abstract": "任意分割模型（SAM）是一种卓越的通用图像分割模型，在医学图像分割领域引起了相当大的关注。尽管SAM在自然图像上表现出色，但在处理医学图像时，特别是涉及低对比度、模糊边界、复杂形状和小尺寸对象的图像时，SAM面临着显著的性能下降和有限的泛化能力。本文提出SAMUS，这是一个专为超声图像分割量身定制的通用模型。与以前基于SAM的通用模型不同，SAMUS追求的不仅是更好的泛化能力，还有更低的部署成本，使其更适合临床应用。具体而言，在SAM的基础上，引入了一个并行CNN分支，通过跨分支注意力将局部特征注入ViT编码器，从而实现更好的医学图像分割。然后，开发了一个位置适配器和一个特征适配器来调整SAM的输",
