    "translated_abstract": "音频深度伪造检测（ADD）是检测由文本到语音或语音转换系统生成的欺骗攻击的任务。用于区分伪造和真实话语的欺骗证据可能存在于输入特征的局部或全局。为了捕捉这些证据，Conformer结合了Transformer和CNN，具有适合的结构。然而，由于Conformer是为序列到序列任务而设计的，直接应用于ADD任务可能不是最优的。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了HM-Conformer，采用了两个组件：（1）分层汇聚方法，逐步减少序列长度以消除重复信息；（2）多级分类令牌聚合方法，利用分类令牌从不同的块中收集信息。由于这些组件的存在，HM-Conformer可以通过处理各种序列长度并聚合它们来高效地检测到欺骗证据。",
