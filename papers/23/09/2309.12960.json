    "translated_abstract": "嵌套事件抽取（NEE）旨在提取包含其他事件作为其参数的复杂事件结构。嵌套事件涉及一种称为中心元素（PEs）的元素，它同时作为外部事件的参数和内部事件的触发器，并将它们连接成嵌套结构。PEs的这种特殊特性给现有的NEE方法带来了挑战，因为它们不能很好地处理PEs的双重身份。因此，本文提出了一种新模型，称为PerNee，主要基于识别PEs来提取嵌套事件。具体而言，PerNee首先识别内部和外部事件的触发器，然后通过分类触发器对之间关系类型来识别PEs。为了获得更好的触发器和参数表示以进一步提高NEE性能，PerNee通过提示学习将事件类型和参数角色的信息纳入其中。由于现有的NEE数据集（例如Gen）",
