To recognize contexts and make decisions for actions accordingly, various artificial intelligence technologies, such as Ontology and OWL, have been adopted as representations for context modeling and reasoning. Recently, with the rise of LLMs and their improved natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities, it has become feasible to model contexts using natural language and perform context reasoning by interacting with LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）自2018年以来急剧增长，自引入上下文感知计算系统20年后。上下文感知计算通过考虑普适设备、用户和社会的情况，实现了广泛的创新应用，如辅助生活、基于位置的社交网络服务等。为了识别上下文并相应地做出决策，采用了各种人工智能技术（如本体论和OWL）作为上下文建模和推理的表示方法。最近，随着LLMs的崛起和它们改进的自然语言理解和推理能力，使用自然语言建模上下文并通过与ChatGPT和GPT-4等LLMs交互进行上下文推理变得可行。在本教程中，我们演示了使用文本、提示和自主代理（AutoAgents）使LLMs能够执行上下文建模的方法。",
