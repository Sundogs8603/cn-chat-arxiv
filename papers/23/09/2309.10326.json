    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the success of question answering (QA), especially its potential to be a foundation paradigm for tackling diverse NLP tasks. However, obtaining sufficient data to build an effective and stable QA system still remains an open problem. For this problem, we introduce an iterative bootstrapping framework for QA data augmentation (named QASnowball), which can iteratively generate large-scale high-quality QA data based on a seed set of supervised examples. Specifically, QASnowball consists of three modules, an answer extractor to extract core phrases in unlabeled documents as candidate answers, a question generator to generate questions based on documents and candidate answers, and a QA data filter to filter out high-quality QA data. Moreover, QASnowball can be self-enhanced by reseeding the seed set to fine-tune itself in different iterations, leading to continual improvements in the generation quality. We conduct experiments in the high-resource English scenario",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，问题回答（QA）取得了成功，特别是其在应对各种自然语言处理任务中的潜力。然而，获取足够的数据来构建一个有效稳定的QA系统仍然是一个未解决的问题。针对这个问题，我们引入了一个迭代自举框架QASnowball，用于QA数据增强，它可以根据有监督的样本种子集迭代地生成大规模高质量的QA数据。具体而言，QASnowball包括三个模块：回答提取器，用于从无标签的文档中提取候选答案的核心短语；问题生成器，根据文档和候选答案生成问题；QA数据过滤器，用于过滤出高质量的QA数据。此外，QASnowball可以通过重新种子化种子集在不同迭代中进行自我增强，从而不断提高生成质量。我们在高资源英文场景中进行了实验。",
