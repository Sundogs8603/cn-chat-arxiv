There are many possible ways to incorporate this additional information into a deep learning model, but the optimal fusion strategy has not yet been determined and can vary between applications.

At the other extreme, known as \"late fusion,\" RGB and non-RGB bands are passed through separate branches of a deep learning model and merged immediately before a final classification or segmentation layer. In this work, we characterize the performance of a suite of multispectral deep learning models with different fusion approaches, quantify their relative reliance on different input bands and evaluate their robustness to naturalistic image corruptions affecting one or more input channels.",

    "translated_abstract": "包含额外光谱波段（例如近红外）的信息可以提高深度学习模型在许多视觉任务中的性能。有许多可能的方法将这些额外信息纳入深度学习模型中，但最佳融合策略尚未确定，并且在不同应用场景中可能有所变化。在其中一个极端，称为\"早期融合\"，额外波段被堆叠为额外通道，以获得具有超过三个通道的输入图像。在另一个极端，称为\"晚期融合\"，RGB和非RGB波段通过深度学习模型的单独分支传递，并在最终分类或分割层之前立即合并。在这项工作中，我们表征了一套不同融合方法的多光谱深度学习模型的性能，量化了它们对不同输入波段的相对依赖性，并评估了它们对影响一个或多个输入通道的自然图像失真的稳健性。",
