    "translated_abstract": "设想一个智能代理，能够通过直观自然的对话辅助用户进行预测任务，而不需要深入了解底层的机器学习（ML）过程。对于这一努力，代理面临的重大挑战是准确理解用户的预测目标，并因此制定精确的ML任务。本文通过引入一种称为“预测话语”的新概念，为实现这一雄心勃勃的目标迈出了创新的一步，并着重于从这些话语中自动和准确地解释用户的预测目标。具体而言，我们将任务框架化为一个槽填充问题，其中每个槽对应于目标预测任务的特定方面。然后，我们采用两种零样本方法来解决槽填充任务，即：1）实体提取（EE）和2）问答（QA）技术。我们在三个精心制作的数据集上进行的实验验证了我们方法的可行性。",
