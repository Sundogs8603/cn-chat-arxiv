    "abstract": "In the last decade, developments in tropical geometry have provided a number of uses directly applicable to problems in statistical learning. The TML package is the first R package which contains a comprehensive set of tools and methods used for basic computations related to tropical convexity, visualization of tropically convex sets, as well as supervised and unsupervised learning models using the tropical metric under the max-plus algebra over the tropical projective torus. Primarily, the TML package employs a Hit and Run Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler in conjunction with the tropical metric as its main tool for statistical inference. In addition to basic computation and various applications of the tropical HAR sampler, we also focus on several supervised and unsupervised methods incorporated in the TML package including tropical principal component analysis, tropical logistic regression and tropical kernel density estimation.",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，热带几何学的发展提供了许多直接应用于统计学习问题的工具。TML软件包是第一个包含一套全面的工具和方法的R软件包，用于处理与热带凸性相关的基本计算、热带凸集的可视化，以及使用热带度量和热带投影环上的max-plus代数进行监督和无监督学习模型。主要的，TML软件包使用Hit and Run Markov chain Monte Carlo采样器与热带度量作为统计推断的主要工具。除了基本计算和热带HAR采样器的各种应用之外，我们还关注TML软件包中包含的几种监督和无监督方法，包括热带主成分分析、热带逻辑回归和热带核密度估计。",
