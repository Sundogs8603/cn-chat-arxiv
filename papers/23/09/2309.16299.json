Heuristically, we extend the usual notion of action to a dual Cognition (high-level)-Action (low-level) architecture by introducing intuitive human cognitive priors, and propose a novel skill IL framework through human-robot interaction, called Cognition-Action-based Skill Imitation Learning (CasIL), for the robotic agent to effectively cognize and imitate the critical skills from raw visual demonstrations. CasIL enables both cognition and action imitation, while high-level skill cognition explicitly guides low-level primitive actions, providing robustness and reliability to the entire skill IL process.

    "translated_abstract": "在长时间任务（如运动、操作等）中，使机器人能够有效地模仿专家技能是一个长期存在的挑战。现有的机器人模仿学习方法在复杂任务中仍面临次优性能的问题。本文考虑如何在人类认知先验的范围内解决这一挑战。我们通过引入直观的人类认知先验，启发性地将行动的概念扩展为双重认知（高层）-行动（低层）架构，并提出了一种新颖的基于认知和行动的技能模仿学习框架（CasIL），通过人机交互来使机器人有效地认知和模仿原始视觉演示中的关键技能。CasIL实现了认知和行动的双重模仿，高级技能认知明确地指导低级基本动作，为整个技能模仿学习过程提供了稳健性和可靠性。",
