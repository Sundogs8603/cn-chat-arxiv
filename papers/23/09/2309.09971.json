    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）具有在多智能体系统中执行复杂调度并将这些智能体协调完成需要广泛协作的复杂任务的能力。然而，尽管已经引入了许多游戏框架，但社区在构建涵盖LLM和人类-NPC协作的通用多智能体协作基础设施方面仍然缺乏基准。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的基础设施- MindAgent-来评估游戏互动的规划和协调新能力。特别是，我们的基础设施利用现有的游戏框架，i）需要对多智能体系统的协调员进行理解，ii）通过未经调优的正确指示与人类玩家合作，iii）建立在少量提示和反馈的情境学习。此外，我们引入了一个新的游戏场景和相关的基准- CUISINEWORLD，该场景派遣了一个多智能体协作系统。",
