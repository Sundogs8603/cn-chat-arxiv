The view that new business creation grows with the optimal level of government investments remains appealing to policymakers. In contrast with this active approach, we build a model where governments may adopt a passive approach to stimulating business creation. The insights from this model suggest new business creation depends positively on factors beyond government investments--attracting high-skilled migrants to the region and lower property prices, taxes, and fines on firms in the informal sector. These findings suggest whether entrepreneurs generate business creation in the region does not only depend on government investments. It also depends on location and skilled migration. Our model also provides methodological implications--the relationship between government investments and new business creation is endogenously determined, so unless adjustments are made, econometric estimates will be biased and inconsistent.

    "translated_abstract": "政府如何吸引企业家及其企业？认为随着政府投资的最佳水平，新业务的创造将增长的观点对决策者有吸引力。与这种积极的方法相反，我们构建了一个模型，其中政府可能采取被动的方法来刺激业务创造。从这个模型的洞察可以得出，新业务的创造取决于除政府投资之外的因素——吸引高技能移民到该地区和降低非正规部门企业的财产价格、税收和罚款等。这些发现表明，企业家是否在该地区产生业务创造不仅取决于政府投资，还取决于地理位置和技能迁移。我们的模型还提供了方法论的含义——政府投资与新业务创造之间的关系是内生确定的，除非进行调整，否则计量估计将存在偏倚和不一致性。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过构建模型表明，吸引高技能移民、降低非正规部门企业的财产价格、税收和罚款等因素对新业务的创造具有正面影响，而不仅仅依赖于政府投资。此外，研究发现政府投资与新业务创造之间的关系是内生确定的，需要进行相应的调整以避免估计结果偏倚和不一致性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study suggests that factors such as attracting high-skilled migrants and reducing property prices, taxes, and fines for firms in the informal sector have a positive impact on new business creation, in addition to government investments. Furthermore, the study finds that the relationship between government investments and new business creation is endogenously determined, requiring adjustments to avoid biased and inconsistent estimation results."
