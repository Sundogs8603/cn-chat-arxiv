    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的神经场类型，它使用通用的径向基函数来表示信号。目前最先进的神经场通常使用基于网格的表示方法来存储局部神经特征，并使用N维线性核来在连续查询点上进行特征插值。它们的神经特征的空间位置固定在网格节点上，并且无法很好地适应目标信号。相反，我们的方法基于具有灵活的核位置和形状的通用径向基函数，具有更高的空间适应性，可以更好地拟合目标信号。为了进一步提高径向基函数的通道容量，我们提出了将其与多频正弦函数组合的方法。这种技术将径向基函数扩展为不同频带的多个傅里叶径向基函数，而不需要额外的参数，便于表示细节。此外，通过将自适应径向基函数与基于网格的方法结合，我们的混合组合继承了两者的优点。",
