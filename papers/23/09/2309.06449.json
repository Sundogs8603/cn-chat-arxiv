    "translated_abstract": "在基于自编码器的异常检测范式中，由于硬件、能源和计算资源有限，将自编码器实现在能够实时学习的边缘设备中是极具挑战性的。我们展示了通过设计具有低分辨率的非挥发性内存基础突触的自编码器，并采用有效的量化神经网络学习算法来解决这些限制。我们提出了一个具有工程缺口的铁磁赛道，其中承载着一个磁性域壁(DW)作为自编码器的突触，在这里通过自旋轨道力(SOT)电流脉冲操纵有限状态(5状态)的突触权重。我们在NSL-KDD数据集上评估了所提出的自编码器模型的异常检测性能。进行了有限分辨率和DW器件随机性感知训练，其异常检测性能与具有浮点精度权重的自编码器相当。",
