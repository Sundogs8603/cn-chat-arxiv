    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）在人工智能和自然语言处理任务中表现出色，如内容创作、报告生成等。然而，对这些模型的不受限制的恶意应用可能导致不良后果，如虚假新闻生成、抄袭等。因此，在负责任地使用LLM时准确检测AI生成的语言非常重要。在本研究中，我们探讨了以下问题：1）某个文本是由AI生成还是人类编写的；2）特定语言模型在生成文本中的归属。我们考虑了英文和西班牙文的文本。本研究中使用的数据集是Automated Text Identification (AuTexTification)共享任务的一部分。针对上述每个研究目标，我们提出了一个基于集成神经模型的方法，该方法从不同的预训练LLM生成概率，这些概率被用作传统机器学习方法的特征。",
