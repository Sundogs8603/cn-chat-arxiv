    "translated_abstract": "尽管人工智能在各个领域取得了显著进展，但其在理解视觉知觉方面的完全潜力仍未得到充分探索。我们提出了一个名为\"VISION\"的人工神经网络，为\"神经活动成像输出的视觉接口系统\"的首字母缩写，模仿人脑并展示如何促进神经科学研究。利用视觉和情境输入，这个多模态模型预测人脑对自然图像的功能性磁共振成像（fMRI）扫描响应。VISION成功预测了人类血氧水平依赖性信号作为fMRI体素值对视觉输入的响应，其准确度比现有技术的性能提高了45%。我们进一步探索训练过的网络以揭示不同视觉区域的表征偏见，产生可实验检验的假设，并制定一个可解释的度量标准将这些假设与皮层功能相关联。",
