    "translated_abstract": "随着社交网络上仇恨言论以不同的形式蔓延，如辱骂语言、网络欺凌和暴力等，人们在暴力方面经历了显著增加，使他们处于不适和威胁的境地。在过去几年中，人们已经投入大量的努力来克服这一现象，以检测不同结构语言（如英语、法语、阿拉伯语等）中的仇恨言论，并为阿拉伯方言（如突尼斯、埃及和海湾）进行了较少的研究。为了填补这一空白，我们在本文中提出了一个完整的方法，用于检测在线阿尔及利亚信息中的仇恨言论。我们评估了许多基于深度学习的架构，这些架构是从一些阿尔及利亚社交网络（Facebook、YouTube和Twitter）中创建的语料库上进行的。该语料库包含13.5K多篇阿拉伯语的阿尔及利亚方言文档，被标记为仇恨或非仇恨。我们获得了令人鼓舞的结果，显示出了该方法的有效性。",
