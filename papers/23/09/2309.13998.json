    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了统计学中一个经典问题：如何在回归模型中添加二阶交互项。随着协变量维度的平方增长，我们开发了一个适应这种增长的估计器，同时提供准确的估计和适当的推理。现有的方法通过仅允许相关主效应之间的交互来克服维度问题。在这一理念基础上，我们使用局部收缩模型在两种效应之间实现了较为灵活的关联。我们通过实验证明，为主效应和交互效应借用收缩的强度可以大大提高回归系数的估计精度。此外，我们评估了该模型在推理方面的潜力，对于选择策略来说这是一个明显困难的问题。我们使用大规模队列数据提供了真实的示例和评估，并与其他方法进行了比较。变量重要性的评估在回归方程中并不容易。",
