    "abstract": "We present VAPOR, a novel method for autonomous legged robot navigation in unstructured, densely vegetated outdoor environments using Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our method trains a novel RL policy from unlabeled data collected in real outdoor vegetation. This policy uses height and intensity-based cost maps derived from 3D LiDAR point clouds, a goal cost map, and processed proprioception data as state inputs, and learns the physical and geometric properties of the surrounding vegetation such as height, density, and solidity/stiffness for navigation. Instead of using end-to-end policy actions, the fully-trained RL policy's Q network is used to evaluate dynamically feasible robot actions generated from a novel adaptive planner capable of navigating through dense narrow passages and preventing entrapment in vegetation such as tall grass and bushes. We demonstrate our method's capabilities on a legged robot in complex outdoor vegetation. We observe an improvement in success rates",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种名为VAPOR的方法，该方法使用离线强化学习（RL）在结构混乱、密集植被的室外环境中实现全向腿式机器人的自主导航。该方法使用从三维LiDAR点云导出的高度和强度基于成本地图、目标成本地图以及经过处理的固有感知数据作为状态输入，从未标记的实际室外植被数据中训练出一种新的RL策略。该策略学习了周围植被的物理和几何特性，如高度、密度和坚实度/刚性，以进行导航。与使用端到端策略动作不同，完全训练好的RL策略的Q网络用于评估由一种新的自适应规划器生成的动态可行机器人动作，该规划器能够穿过狭窄的通道并防止被植被，例如高草和灌木丛所困住。我们在复杂的室外植被上展示了该方法的能力。我们观察到成功率有所提高。",
