    "abstract": "Effective learning strategies based on principles like personalization, retrieval practice, and spaced repetition are often challenging to implement due to practical constraints. Here we explore the integration of AI tutors to complement learning programs in accordance with learning sciences. A semester-long study was conducted at UniDistance Suisse, where an AI tutor app was provided to psychology students taking a neuroscience course (N=51). After automatically generating microlearning questions from existing course materials using GPT-3, the AI tutor developed a dynamic neural-network model of each student's grasp of key concepts. This enabled the implementation of distributed retrieval practice, personalized to each student's individual level and abilities. The results indicate that students who actively engaged with the AI tutor achieved significantly higher grades. Moreover, active engagement led to an average improvement of up to 15 percentile points compared to a parallel cours",

    "translated_abstract": "基于个性化、检索练习和间隔重复等原则的有效学习策略往往难以在实践中实施。在这里，我们探索了将AI导师与学习计划相结合，根据学习科学进行补充。在UniDistance Suisse进行了一个学期长的研究，将一个AI导师应用提供给修读神经科学课程的心理学学生（N=51）。通过使用GPT-3从现有课程材料自动生成微学习问题，AI导师开发了每个学生对关键概念的理解的动态神经网络模型。这使得可以根据每个学生个体水平和能力个性化实施分布式检索练习。结果表明，积极使用AI导师参与学习的学生获得了显著更高的成绩。此外，积极参与导致平均提高了最多15个百分点，相比于平行课程。",
