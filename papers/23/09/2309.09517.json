    "translated_abstract": "最近几年来，由于联邦图神经网络（GNN）能够在数据隔离场景下执行与图相关的任务并保护数据隐私，联邦训练已经变得流行起来。然而，联邦GNN系统中的图异构性问题仍然存在挑战。现有的框架通过使用不同的统计量来表示局部任务，并通过简单的聚合机制将它们联系起来来解决这个问题。然而，这些方法在两个方面都效率有限：任务相关性量化的质量低和利用协作结构的无效性。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了FedGKD，一种新颖的联邦GNN框架，它利用一种新颖的客户端图数据集蒸馏方法提取更好地描述任务相关性的任务特征，并引入一个新颖的服务器端聚合机制，该机制能够感知到全局的协作结构。我们在六个真实世界的数据集上进行了大量实验证明了FedGKD框架的有效性。",
