    "translated_abstract": "记录了有关系统信息的日志在系统监控和调试中起着关键作用，包括事件和状态。尽管已经提出了各种方法来检测日志序列中的异常，但它们往往忽视了考虑系统组件之间的关系的重要性，例如服务和用户，这些可以从日志内容中识别出来。理解这些关系对于检测异常及其潜在原因至关重要。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了GLAD，一个基于图的日志异常检测框架，用于检测系统日志中的关联异常。GLAD将日志语义、关系模式和顺序模式纳入统一框架进行异常检测。具体而言，GLAD首先引入一个字段提取模块，利用基于提示的少样本学习从日志内容中识别出关键字段。然后，GLAD通过互连提取的字段和日志事件构建滑动窗口的动态日志图。",
