    "translated_abstract": "理解哪个交通灯控制哪个车道对于安全通过路口至关重要。自动驾驶车辆通常依赖包含交通灯-车道分配信息的高清地图。手动提供这些信息既费时又昂贵，而且不可扩展。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，利用交通灯状态和车辆运动模式推导出分配方式。该方法自动化并且不依赖几何排列。我们通过实现和评估基于模式的贡献方法展示了基本统计方法在这个任务上的有效性。此外，我们的新颖的拒绝方法通过利用统计假设检验考虑了安全因素。最后，我们提出了一种数据集转换方法，以重新利用现有的运动预测数据集进行语义地图学习。我们还提供了适用于Lyft Level 5数据集的公开API。",
