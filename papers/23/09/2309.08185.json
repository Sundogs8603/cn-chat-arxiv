    "translated_abstract": "多语句级语义搜索是在不同语言组合中检索与查询相关内容的任务。这需要更好地理解用户意图和上下文含义。与单语或双语搜索相比，多语句级语义搜索相对较少被探索且更具挑战性，这是由于该任务缺乏多语言并行资源和需要规避“语言偏见”。在本研究中，我们提出了一种用于低资源场景的对齐方法：MAML-Align。我们的方法利用基于元蒸馏学习的MAML，即基于优化的模型不可知元学习器，将知识从专门从单语到双语语义搜索进行传递的教师元传递模型T-MAML蒸馏到学生模型S-MAML，后者从双语到多语语义搜索进行元传递。据我们所知，我们是第一个将元蒸馏应用于多语境的研究。",

By transferring knowledge from monolingual to bilingual semantic search and then from bilingual to multilingual semantic search, it extends the capability to handle multiple language contexts."
