    "translated_abstract": "分布式优化是在分散式多智能体系统中进行协作推理和决策的基本框架。操作被建模为共同最小化一个共享目标，该目标通常依赖于每个智能体本地收集的观测。分布式优化算法（如常见的D-ADMM）通过迭代地结合本地计算和消息交换来解决这个任务。与分布式优化（特别是D-ADMM）相关的主要挑战之一是它需要大量的通信，即代理之间交换的消息，以达成共识。这使得D-ADMM在功耗、延迟和通道资源方面变得昂贵。在本文中，我们提出了展开的D-ADMM，它采用新兴的深度展开方法，使D-ADMM能够可靠地通过每个智能体事先定义的少量消息进行操作。展开的D-ADMM完全保留D-ADMM的操作，同时利用数据的空间和时间相关性来减少通信成本。",
