In this work, we make a systematic assessment of the capabilities, strengths, and limitations of selected LLMs in the field of NetOps. The evaluation is conducted on a collection of 5,732 questions about NetOps, encompassing 26 publicly available general-domain LLMs, including ChatGPT, LLaMA, Falcon, etc. We also finetune some of these LLMs with our collected NetOps corpus and evaluate the resulting models.
