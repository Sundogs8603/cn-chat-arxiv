    "abstract": "Despite the progress we have recorded in the last few years in multilingual natural language processing, evaluation is typically limited to a small set of languages with available datasets which excludes a large number of low-resource languages. In this paper, we created SIB-200 -- a large-scale open-sourced benchmark dataset for topic classification in 200 languages and dialects to address the lack of evaluation dataset for Natural Language Understanding (NLU). For many of the languages covered in SIB-200, this is the first publicly available evaluation dataset for NLU. The dataset is based on Flores-200 machine translation corpus. We annotated the English portion of the dataset and extended the sentence-level annotation to the remaining 203 languages covered in the corpus. Despite the simplicity of this task, our evaluation in full-supervised setting, cross-lingual transfer setting and prompting of large language model setting show that there is still a large gap between the performa",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管在多语言自然语言处理方面取得了进展，但评估通常仅限于一小部分带有可用数据集的语言，排除了许多资源匮乏的语言。本文创建了SIB-200，这是一个用于主题分类的大规模开放源代码基准数据集，涵盖了200多种语言和方言，以弥补自然语言理解（NLU）缺乏评估数据集的问题。对于SIB-200中涵盖的许多语言来说，这是首个公开可用的NLU评估数据集。该数据集基于Flores-200机器翻译语料库，并对该语料库涵盖的其他203种语言进行了句子级注释。尽管该任务简单，但我们在全监督设置、跨语言迁移设置和大型语言模型提示设置下的评估结果表明，性能仍存在较大差距。",
