    "translated_abstract": "非均匀扩散过程与扩散张量在图像分析、物理学和工程学中具有重要意义。然而，它们的数值近似对耗散性伪影和与旋转不变性偏离有强烈影响。在这项工作中，我们研究了一个大型的有限差分离散化家族，使用了一个3 x 3的模板。我们通过将二维非均匀扩散分解为四个一维扩散来推导出它。结果的模板类包含一个自由参数，涵盖了广泛的现有离散化。它包括Weickert等人(2013)的完整模板家族，并表明它们的两个参数包含冗余。此外，我们建立了与模板相对应的矩阵的谱范数上界。这给出了在欧几里得范数中保证显式方案稳定性的时间步长限制。我们的方向分割还允许将显式方案非常自然地转化为ResNet块。使用神经网络库实现简单。",
