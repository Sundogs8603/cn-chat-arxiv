    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了潜在连续时间随机过程的统计推断问题，该问题通常难以处理，特别是对于由Markov跳跃过程描述的离散状态空间过程。为了克服这个问题，我们提出了一种新的可处理的推断方案，基于熵匹配框架，可以嵌入到众所周知的期望传播算法中。我们通过为一类简单的近似分布提供闭式结果，并将其应用于化学反应网络的一般类别，该类别是系统生物学建模的重要工具，来证明我们方法的有效性。此外，我们使用近似的期望最大化程序导出了潜在参数的点估计的闭式表达式。我们评估了我们方法在各种化学反应网络示例中的性能，包括随机的Lotka-Voltera示例，并讨论了它的局限性和未来的潜力。",
