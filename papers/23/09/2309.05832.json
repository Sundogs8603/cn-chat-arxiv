    "abstract": "This work presents an instance-agnostic learning framework that fuses vision with dynamics to simultaneously learn shape, pose trajectories and physical properties via the use of geometry as a shared representation. Unlike many contact learning approaches that assume motion capture input and a known shape prior for the collision model, our proposed framework learns an object's geometric and dynamic properties from RGBD video, without requiring either category-level or instance-level shape priors. We integrate a vision system, BundleSDF, with a dynamics system, ContactNets and propose a cyclic training pipeline to use the output from the dynamics module to refine the poses and the geometry from the vision module, using perspective reprojection. Experiments demonstrate our framework's ability to learn the geometry and dynamics of rigid and convex objects and improve upon the current tracking framework.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个实例无关的学习框架，通过几何作为共享表示，将视觉与动力学相结合，同时学习形状、姿态轨迹和物理性质。与许多接触学习方法不同，我们的框架从RGBD视频中学习物体的几何和动力学属性，而不需要类别级别或实例级别的形状先验知识。我们将视觉系统BundleSDF与动力学系统ContactNets集成，并提出了一个循环训练管道，使用动力学模块的输出通过透视重投影来改进视觉模块的姿态和几何。实验证明了我们的框架学习刚性和凸物体的几何和动力学，并改进了当前的跟踪框架。",
