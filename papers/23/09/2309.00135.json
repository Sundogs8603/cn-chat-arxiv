We start by unravelling the historical links between the two fields, showing that their relationship is rooted in a common attitude towards human communication and language. We then discuss the first direction of influence, focussing in particular on how insights and techniques from the field of artificial intelligence play an important role in operationalising, validating and scaling constructionist approaches to language.
