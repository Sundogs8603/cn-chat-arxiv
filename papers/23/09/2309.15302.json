    "abstract": "Terrain awareness, i.e., the ability to identify and distinguish different types of terrain, is a critical ability that robots must have to succeed at autonomous off-road navigation. Current approaches that provide robots with this awareness either rely on labeled data which is expensive to collect, engineered features and cost functions that may not generalize, or expert human demonstrations which may not be available. Towards endowing robots with terrain awareness without these limitations, we introduce Self-supervised TErrain Representation LearnING (STERLING), a novel approach for learning terrain representations that relies solely on easy-to-collect, unconstrained (e.g., non-expert), and unlabelled robot experience, with no additional constraints on data collection. STERLING employs a novel multi-modal self-supervision objective through non-contrastive representation learning to learn relevant terrain representations for terrain-aware navigation.
