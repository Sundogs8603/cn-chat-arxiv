    "translated_abstract": "数字叙事作为一种艺术形式，一直在费用与质量之间挣扎。AI生成内容（AIGC）的出现被视为高效数字叙事制作的潜在解决方案。然而，这种融合的具体形式、效果和影响仍不清楚，使得AIGC与叙事的边界模糊不清。本研究探讨了AIGC与数字叙事的当前整合状态，在样本项目中研究了两者融合的艺术价值，并通过访谈解决常见问题。通过我们的研究，我们发现AIGC在图像创作、配音制作和音乐创作方面表现出色，但由于人类创造力和审美感的不可替代元素，尤其是在复杂人物动画、面部表情和音效方面，AIGC还无法取代人类。本研究的目标是增强公众对当前状态、限制和挑战的认识。",
