    "translated_abstract": "自动检测声音病理能够实现客观评估和早期干预诊断。本研究对声门源特征进行了系统分析，并研究了它们在声音病理检测中的有效性。通过使用准封闭相位（QCP）的声门逆滤波方法估计得到的声门流动、使用零频率滤波（ZFF）方法计算得到的近似声门源信号，以及直接使用声学声音信号来提取声门源特征。此外，我们提出从由QCP和ZFF计算出的声门源波形中推导出梅尔频率倒谱系数（MFCCs），以有效捕捉病理性声音的声门源频谱变化。实验使用了两个数据库，即医院Universitario Principe de Asturias（HUPA）数据库和Saarbrucken Voice Disorders（SVD）数据库。特征分析揭示了声门源中包含的信息的判别作用。",
