    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了改进的平面旋转器方法（MPRS），这是一种受物理启发的用于空间/时间回归的机器学习方法。MPRS是一个非参数模型，通过短程、距离相关的“相互作用”来引入空间或时间相关性，而不需要假设底层概率分布的特定形式。预测是通过完全自主的学习算法进行的，该算法使用平衡条件的蒙特卡罗模拟。MPRS能够处理分散的数据和任意的空间维度。我们在一维、二维和三维上对各种合成和真实世界的数据进行了测试，测试结果表明MPRS的预测性能（无需参数调整）与普通克里金法和逆距离加权法等标准插值方法相当。特别是，MPRS是一种特别有效的填补缺口方法，适用于粗糙和非高斯数据（如每日降水时间序列）。",
