    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，监督式卷积神经网络（CNN）在学习时间序列数据的分层表示方面具有优越性，可用于成功的分类。然而，这些方法需要足够大的标记数据进行稳定学习，但是获取高质量的标记时间序列数据可能代价高昂，也可能不可行。生成对抗网络（GANs）在增强无监督和半监督学习方面取得了巨大成功。然而，据我们所知，GANs如何有效地作为学习时间序列识别（即分类和聚类）的通用解决方案仍然不清楚。上述考虑激发了我们引入了一个时间序列卷积GAN（TCGAN）。TCGAN通过在没有标签信息的情况下，两个一维CNN（即生成器和判别器）之间进行对抗博弈来学习。然后，训练的TCGAN的一部分被重复利用来构建一个表示学习器。",
