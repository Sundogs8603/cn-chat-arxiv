    "abstract": "We evaluate the ability of semantic parsers based on large language models (LLMs) to handle contextual utterances. In real-world settings, there typically exists only a limited number of annotated contextual utterances due to annotation cost, resulting in an imbalance compared to non-contextual utterances. Therefore, parsers must adapt to contextual utterances with a few training examples. We examine four major paradigms for doing so in conversational semantic parsing i.e., Parse-with-Utterance-History, Parse-with-Reference-Program, Parse-then-Resolve, and Rewrite-then-Parse. To facilitate such cross-paradigm comparisons, we construct SMCalFlow-EventQueries, a subset of contextual examples from SMCalFlow with additional annotations. Experiments with in-context learning and fine-tuning suggest that Rewrite-then-Parse is the most promising paradigm when holistically considering parsing accuracy, annotation cost, and error types.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们评估了基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的语义解析器处理语境话语的能力。在现实世界中，由于注释成本，通常只存在有限数量的注释语境话语，导致与非语境话语相比不平衡。因此，解析器必须使用少量训练示例来适应语境话语。我们在对话式语义解析中考察了四种主要的范式，即带有话语历史的解析、带有参考程序的解析、解析-解决、重写-解析。为了促进跨范式比较，我们构建了SMCalFlow-EventQueries，这是从SMCalFlow中选择的带有附加注释的语境示例的子集。在语境学习和微调的实验中，结果表明重写-解析是在全面考虑解析准确性、注释成本和错误类型等因素时最有前途的范式。",
