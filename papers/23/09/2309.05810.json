    "abstract": "We present SHIFT3D, a differentiable pipeline for generating 3D shapes that are structurally plausible yet challenging to 3D object detectors. In safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, discovering such novel challenging objects can offer insight into unknown vulnerabilities of 3D detectors. By representing objects with a signed distanced function (SDF), we show that gradient error signals allow us to smoothly deform the shape or pose of a 3D object in order to confuse a downstream 3D detector. Importantly, the objects generated by SHIFT3D physically differ from the baseline object yet retain a semantically recognizable shape. Our approach provides interpretable failure modes for modern 3D object detectors, and can aid in preemptive discovery of potential safety risks within 3D perception systems before these risks become critical failures.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了SHIFT3D，一个可微分的流水线，用于生成在结构上合理且具有挑战性的三维形状，以欺骗三维物体检测器。在自动驾驶等安全关键应用中，发现这种新颖的具有挑战性的物体可以揭示三维检测器的未知漏洞。通过使用有符号距离函数（SDF）来表示物体，我们展示了梯度误差信号使我们能够平滑地改变三维物体的形状或姿态，以困惑下游的三维检测器。重要的是，SHIFT3D生成的物体在物理上与基准物体不同，但保留了语义可识别的形状。我们的方法为现代三维物体检测器提供了可解释的故障模式，并且可以在这些风险变成严重故障之前，有助于预防性地发现潜在的安全风险。",
