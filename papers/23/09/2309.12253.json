    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了CLRS算法学习基准的扩展，优先考虑可扩展性和稀疏表示的利用。CLRS中的许多算法需要全局存储器或信息交换，在其执行模型中镜像表达为基于底层问题构建完全连接（而非稀疏）图的操作。尽管CLRS的目标是评估学习算法在更大实例上的泛化能力，但现有的执行模型由于其要求高的内存需求和运行时间而成为一个重要限制（难以扩展）。然而，许多重要的算法并不需要完全连接的图；这些主要分布式算法与图神经网络采用的消息传递范式密切相关。因此，我们提出了SALSA-CLRS，一个专门考虑可扩展性和稀疏性的CLRS基准的扩展。我们的方法包括从原始CLRS基准中改编的算法，并引入了新的问题。",
