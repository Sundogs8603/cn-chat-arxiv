    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了化学反应网络（CRNs）的动力学，目标是推导出它们反应速率的上界。由于CRNs的非线性性质和离散结构，这个任务是具有挑战性的。为了解决这个问题，我们采用了信息几何方法，利用自然梯度，构建了一个非线性系统，可以得到CRN动力学的上界。我们通过数值模拟验证了我们的方法，在特定类别的CRNs中展示了更快的收敛速度。这个类别的特征包括化学品的数量、化学反应的化学计量系数的最大值和反应的数量。我们还将我们的方法与传统方法进行了比较，结果表明传统方法无法提供CRNs的反应速率的上界。尽管我们的研究重点是CRNs，但从自然科学到工程学中超图的普遍存在表明我们的方法可能具有更广泛的应用，包括信息科学领域。",
