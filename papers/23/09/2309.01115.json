    "translated_abstract": "本研究使用矩阵归一化对四川省46个关键产业2000-2019年的能源消耗数据进行预处理。DBSCAN聚类识别了16个特征类别以客观地分组行业。接下来，采用罚函数回归模型，以应对过拟合控制、高维数据处理和特征选择等复杂能源数据处理的优势。结果表明，煤炭周围的第二个聚类因生产需求而产生的排放量最高。以汽油和焦炭为中心的聚类的排放量也很显著。基于此，减排建议包括清洁煤技术、交通管理、钢铁中的煤电替代和行业标准化。该研究引入了无监督学习的方法来客观选择因素，并旨在探索新的减排途径。总而言之，本研究确定了行业分组，评估了排放驱动因素，并提出了科学的减排策略以进一步改善情况。",
