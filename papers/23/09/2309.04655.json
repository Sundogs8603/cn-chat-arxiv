Although there are a few examples of exoskeletons, they need manual operations due to the absence of sensor feedback and no intention prediction of movements. Here, we introduce an intelligent upper-limb exoskeleton system that uses cloud-based deep learning to predict human intention for strength augmentation. The embedded soft wearable sensors provide sensory feedback by collecting real-time muscle signals, which are simultaneously computed to determine the user's intended movement. The cloud-based deep-learning predicts four upper-limb joint motions with an average accuracy of 96.2% at a 200-250 millisecond response rate, suggesting that the exoskeleton operates just by human intention. In addition, an array of soft pneumatics assists the intended movements by providing 897 newton of force and 78.7 millimeter of displacement at maximum. Col",

    "translated_abstract": "随着年龄增长和中风等因素，人体肌肉骨骼力量下降，影响了使用上肢进行日常任务的能力。虽然现有一些外骨骼装置，但由于缺乏传感器反馈和对运动意图的预测，需要手动操作。本研究引入了一种智能上肢外骨骼系统，利用云端深度学习来预测人类的意图以增强力量。嵌入式柔性传感器通过收集实时肌肉信号提供感觉反馈，并同时计算以确定用户的意图运动。云端深度学习预测四种上肢关节运动，平均准确率达到96.2%，响应速度为200-250毫秒，表明外骨骼系统完全依靠人类意图进行操作。此外，一组柔性气动装置通过提供897牛顿力和78.7毫米的位移来辅助意图运动。",
