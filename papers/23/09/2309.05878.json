    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a flow based machine learning approach, called reaction coordinate (RC) flow, for discovery of low-dimensional kinetic models of molecular systems. The RC flow utilizes a normalizing flow to design the coordinate transformation and a Brownian dynamics model to approximate the kinetics of RC, where all model parameters can be estimated in a data-driven manner. In contrast to existing model reduction methods for molecular kinetics, RC flow offers a trainable and tractable model of reduced kinetics in continuous time and space due to the invertibility of the normalizing flow. Furthermore, the Brownian dynamics-based reduced kinetic model investigated in this work yields a readily discernible representation of metastable states within the phase space of the molecular system. Numerical experiments demonstrate how effectively the proposed method discovers interpretable and accurate low-dimensional representations of given full-state kinetics from simulations.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们引入了一种基于流的机器学习方法，称为反应坐标（RC）流，用于发现分子系统低维动力学模型。RC流利用归一化流设计坐标变换，并使用布朗动力学模型来近似RC的动力学，所有模型参数可以以数据驱动的方式进行估计。与现有的分子动力学模型简化方法不同，由于归一化流的可逆性，RC流在连续时间和空间中提供了可训练和可处理的简化动力学模型。此外，本文研究的基于布朗动力学的简化动力学模型在分子系统的相空间中产生了易于辨别的亚稳态表示。数值实验证明了所提方法如何有效地发现给定的完整状态动力学的可解释和准确的低维表示。",
