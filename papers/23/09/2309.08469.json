    "abstract": "Modern open-domain question answering systems often rely on accurate and efficient retrieval components to find passages containing the facts necessary to answer the question. Recently, neural retrievers have gained popularity over lexical alternatives due to their superior performance. However, most of the work concerns popular languages such as English or Chinese. For others, such as Polish, few models are available. In this work, we present SilverRetriever, a neural retriever for Polish trained on a diverse collection of manually or weakly labeled datasets. SilverRetriever achieves much better results than other Polish models and is competitive with larger multilingual models. Together with the model, we open-source five new passage retrieval datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "现代开放领域的问答系统通常依赖于准确和高效的检索组件来找到包含回答问题所需事实的段落。近年来，由于其出色的性能，神经检索器比词汇替代方式更受欢迎。然而，大部分研究都集中在流行语言如英语或中文上，对于其他语言如波兰语，可用的模型很少。在本文中，我们介绍了SilverRetriever，一个基于多种手动标记或弱标记数据集训练的波兰语神经检索器。SilverRetriever在波兰语模型中取得了比其他模型更好的结果，并与更大的多语种模型具有竞争力。与该模型一起，我们还开源了五个新的段落检索数据集。",
    "tldr": "SilverRetriever是一个特为波兰语问答系统开发的神经检索器，通过训练在多种数据集上取得了显著的改进效果，并且与更大的多语种模型具有竞争力。",
    "en_tdlr": "SilverRetriever is a neural retriever specifically designed for Polish question answering systems, which achieves significant improvement by training on multiple datasets and is competitive with larger multilingual models."
