While traditional methods of language translation, such as written text or voice-only translations, can accomplish the task, they often fail to capture the complete context and nuanced information conveyed through nonverbal cues like facial expressions and lip movements. In this paper, we present an end-to-end video translation system that not only translates spoken language but also synchronizes the translated speech with the lip movements of the speaker. Our system focuses on translating educational lectures in various Indian languages, and it is designed to be effective even in low-resource system settings.

    "translated_abstract": "在当今全球化的世界中，与来自不同语言背景的人有效沟通变得越来越重要。虽然传统的语言翻译方法，如文字或仅声音的翻译，可以完成任务，但它们常常无法捕捉到通过面部表情和嘴唇动作传达的完整上下文和微妙信息。在本文中，我们提出了一个端到端的视频翻译系统，它不仅可以翻译口语，还可以将翻译的语音与说话者的嘴唇动作同步。我们的系统专注于翻译各种印度语言的教育讲座，并且它被设计成在资源有限的系统设置中也能有效。通过将与目标语言一致的嘴唇动作与说话者的声音进行匹配，使用语音克隆技术，我们的应用为学生和用户提供了一种增强的体验。这个附加功能创造了一个更完整的视频翻译体验。",
