In this study, we present a system called Quantum Computing-based System for Portfolio Optimization with Future Asset Values and Automatic Universe Reduction (Q4FuturePOP), which deals with the Portfolio Optimization Problem considering the following innovations: i) the developed tool is modeled for working with future prediction of assets, instead of historical values; and ii) Q4FuturePOP includes an automatic universe reduction module, which is conceived to intelligently reduce the complexity of the problem. We also introduce a brief discussion about the preliminary performance of the different modules that compose the prototypical version of Q4FuturePOP.",
