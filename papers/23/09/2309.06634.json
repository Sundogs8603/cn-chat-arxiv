Our algorithm is based on $G$-means clustering which searches for the optimal number of clusters in $k$-means by conducting iteratively the Anderson-Darling test. Our splitting procedure employs a Gaussian mixture model in order to choose carefully the cover based on the distribution of a given data. Experiments for synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm generates covers so that the Mapper graphs retain the essence of the datasets.",
