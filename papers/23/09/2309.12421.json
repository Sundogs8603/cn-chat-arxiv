    "translated_abstract": "小型和中型企业面临的主要挑战之一是安全地管理软件更新和变更。特别是在快速发展的网络安全威胁下，需对软件系统进行必要的变更/更新/补丁，以保持对新兴威胁的应对能力，同时也经常是监管机构要求的。但是，安全补丁/更新需要在生产系统发布之前进行压力测试。在生产环境中进行压力测试存在风险并带来安全威胁。大型企业通常具有非生产环境，可以在发布到生产环境之前进行变更和测试。然而，小型企业没有这样的设施。在这项工作中，我们展示了如何在云上创建“数字孪生”，特别是针对IT和物联网环境的混合环境。这些数字孪生可以作为非生产环境，在这里可以进行变更，并可以在发布补丁之前进行安全测试。",
