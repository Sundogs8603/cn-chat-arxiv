    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了FunCodec，一个基础的神经语音编解码器工具包，它是开源语音处理工具包FunASR的扩展。FunCodec提供了可复现的训练方法和推断脚本，用于最新的神经语音编解码器模型，如SoundStream和Encodec。由于与FunASR的统一设计，FunCodec可以轻松地整合到下游任务中，如语音识别。除了FunCodec，还提供了预训练模型，可用于学术或普遍用途。基于该工具包，我们进一步提出了频域编解码器模型FreqCodec，它可以以更低的计算和参数复杂度实现相当的语音质量。实验结果表明，在相同的压缩比下，FunCodec可以实现与其他工具包和发布模型相比更好的重构质量。我们还证明了预训练模型适用于包括自动语音识别在内的下游任务。",
