By forecasting counterfactuals using a short time series of pre-treatment data, unbiased estimators of individual treatment effects and a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator of the average treatment effects are obtained.

Simple basis function regressions can deliver unbiasedness under a broad class of data-generating processes, while basing the forecasts on a model may introduce misspecification bias and not necessarily improve performance. Consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator are guaranteed under certain conditions."
