    "abstract": "Advancements in conversational systems have revolutionized information access, surpassing the limitations of single queries. However, developing dialogue systems requires a large amount of training data, which is a challenge in low-resource domains and languages. Traditional data collection methods like crowd-sourcing are labor-intensive and time-consuming, making them ineffective in this context. Data augmentation (DA) is an affective approach to alleviate the data scarcity problem in conversational systems. This tutorial provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of DA approaches in the context of conversational systems. It highlights recent advances in conversation augmentation, open domain and task-oriented conversation generation, and different paradigms of evaluating these models. We also discuss current challenges and future directions in order to help researchers and practitioners to further advance the field in this area.",

    "translated_abstract": "对话系统的发展已经彻底改变了信息获取方式，超越了单一查询的限制。然而，开发对话系统需要大量的训练数据，在资源有限的领域和语言中具有挑战性。传统的数据收集方法，如众包，需要大量的人力和时间，因此在此情景下效率低下。数据增强（DA）是一种缓解对话系统中数据稀缺问题的有效方法。本教程全面且最新地概述了在对话系统中使用的DA方法，包括对话增强、开放域和任务导向的对话生成以及不同的评估模型的范式。我们还讨论了当前的挑战和未来的发展方向，以帮助研究人员和从业者进一步推动这一领域的发展。",
