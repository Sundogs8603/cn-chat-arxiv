    "abstract": "How much has market power increased in the United States in the last fifty years? Using micro-level data from U.S. Compustat, we find that several indicators of market power have steadily increased since 1970. The aggregate markup has gone up from 10% of price over marginal cost in 1970 to 23% in 2020, and aggregate returns to scale have risen from 1.00 to 1.13. We connect these market-power indicators to profitability by showing that the aggregate profit share can be expressed in terms of the aggregate markup, aggregate returns to scale, and a sufficient statistic for production networks that captures double marginalization in the economy. We find that despite the rise in market power, the profit share has been constant at 18% of GDP because the increase in monopoly rents has been completely offset by rising fixed costs. Our empirical results have subtle implications for policymakers: overly aggressive enforcement of antitrust law could decrease firm dynamism and paradoxically lead to",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的五十年里，美国的市场权力增加了多少？利用美国Compustat的微观层面数据，我们发现自1970年以来，市场权力的几个指标逐渐增加。从1970年的价格与边际成本的10％增加到2020年的23％，并且规模回报率从1.00增加到1.13。我们将这些市场权力指标与盈利能力相联系，通过展示利润份额可以用总体加价、总体规模回报率和一个捕捉到经济中双重边际效益的生产网络的充分统计量来表示。尽管市场权力上升，但利润份额在GDP中保持18％不变，因为垄断租金的增加完全被不断上升的固定成本抵消了。我们的实证结果对政策制定者有微妙的影响：过于激进的反垄断执法可能会降低公司活力，反而导致",
