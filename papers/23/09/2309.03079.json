    "translated_abstract": "上市公司的年度报告包含了关于其财务状况的重要信息，可以帮助评估其对股票价格的潜在影响。这些报告的内容非常全面，有时甚至超过100页。即使对于一个公司来说，分析这些报告也是一项繁琐的工作，更不用说整个公司群体了。多年来，金融专家已经能够相对快速地从这些文件中提取有价值的信息。然而，这需要多年的实践和经验。本文旨在通过利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的能力，简化对所有公司年度报告的评估过程。LLM生成的洞察力被汇编在一个量化风格的数据集中，并通过历史股价数据进行补充。然后使用LLM输出作为特征训练一种机器学习模型。前向测试结果显示相对于标普500指数获得了有希望的超额回报。本文旨在",
