    "abstract": "Recently, excellent progress has been made in speech recognition. However, pure data-driven approaches have struggled to solve the problem in domain-mismatch and long-tailed data. Considering that knowledge-driven approaches can help data-driven approaches alleviate their flaws, we introduce sememe-based semantic knowledge information to speech recognition (SememeASR). Sememe, according to the linguistic definition, is the minimum semantic unit in a language and is able to represent the implicit semantic information behind each word very well. Our experiments show that the introduction of sememe information can improve the effectiveness of speech recognition. In addition, our further experiments show that sememe knowledge can improve the model's recognition of long-tailed data and enhance the model's domain generalization ability.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，语音识别取得了显著进展。然而，纯数据驱动方法在领域不匹配和长尾数据的问题上仍然有困难。考虑到基于知识驱动的方法可以帮助数据驱动的方法减轻其缺陷，我们引入了基于语义单元——sememe的语义知识信息到语音识别中（SememeASR）。Sememe根据语言学的定义是语言中的最小语义单位，并且能够很好地代表每个单词背后的隐含语义信息。我们的实验表明，引入sememe信息可以提高语音识别的效果。此外，我们的进一步实验显示，sememe知识可以提高模型对长尾数据的识别能力，并增强模型的领域泛化能力。",
