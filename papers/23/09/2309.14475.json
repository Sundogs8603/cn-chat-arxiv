Yet, what makes an excerpt effective remains unexplored. We leverage a policy change by Apple that generates quasi-exogenous variation in the excerpts of songs in the iTunes Music Store to estimate that having a 60 second longer excerpt increases songs' unique monthly listeners by 5.4% on average, by 9.7% for lesser known songs, and by 11.1% for lesser known artists. This is comparable to the impact of being featured on the Spotify Global Top 50 playlist. We develop measures of musical repetition and unpredictability to examine information provision as a mechanism, and find that the demand-enhancing effect of longer excerpts is suppressed when they are repetitive, too predictable, or too unpredictable.

    "translated_abstract": "音乐摘录被广泛用于预览和推广音乐作品。有效的摘录可以促使源音乐作品的消费，从而产生收入。然而，什么使得摘录有效仍然未被探索。我们利用苹果的一项政策变化，通过iTunes音乐商店中歌曲摘录的准实验变化，估计摘录时间延长60秒可以平均增加歌曲的独立每月听众5.4％，陌生歌曲增加9.7％，陌生艺术家增加11.1％。这相当于被收录在Spotify全球Top 50播放列表中的影响。我们开发了音乐重复性和不可预测性的衡量指标，以考察信息提供作为一种机制，并发现当摘录过于重复、过于可预测或过于不可预测时，延长摘录时间对需求的增强效果会被压制。我们的发现支持平台采用更长的摘录来改善内容发现，而我们的衡量指标可以帮助提供摘录选择的信息。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过分析iTunes音乐商店中歌曲摘录的准实验变化，发现延长摘录时间可以显著增加歌曲的独立每月听众，特别是对于陌生歌曲和陌生艺术家的效果更为显著。此外，摘录的重复性和可预测性对需求的增强效果有一定的压制作用。因此，该研究支持平台采用更长的摘录时间来改善内容发现。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study finds that extending the length of music excerpts can significantly increase the unique monthly listeners of songs, particularly for lesser known songs and artists. Additionally, the repetition and predictability of excerpts have a suppressing effect on the demand-enhancing effect. Therefore, this study supports platforms adopting longer excerpt durations to improve content discovery."
