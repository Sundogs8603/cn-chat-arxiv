    "translated_abstract": "交互式物体抓取(IOG)是通过人机自然语言交流识别和抓取目标物体的任务。当前IOG系统假定人类用户最初指定目标对象的类别(例如，瓶子)。受到语用学的启发，人类往往通过依赖上下文来传达意图以实现目标。我们引入了一项新的IOG任务，即实用IOG，并提出相应的数据集，即面向意图的多模态对话(IM-Dial)。在我们提出的任务场景中，首先给出一个面向意图的话语(例如，“我渴了”)。然后，机器人应通过与人类用户互动来识别目标对象。基于任务设置，我们提出了一个新的机器人系统，可以解释用户的意图并捡起目标对象，即实用物体抓取(PROGrasp)。PROGrasp通过结合视觉定位、问题提问、物体抓取以及最重要的，答案解释模块执行实用IOG。",
