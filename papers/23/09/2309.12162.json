    "abstract": "We study batched bandit experiments and consider the problem of inference conditional on the realized stopping time, assignment probabilities, and target parameter, where all of these may be chosen adaptively using information up to the last batch of the experiment. Absent further restrictions on the experiment, we show that inference using only the results of the last batch is optimal. When the adaptive aspects of the experiment are known to be location-invariant, in the sense that they are unchanged when we shift all batch-arm means by a constant, we show that there is additional information in the data, captured by one additional linear function of the batch-arm means. In the more restrictive case where the stopping time, assignment probabilities, and target parameter are known to depend on the data only through a collection of polyhedral events, we derive computationally tractable and optimal conditional inference procedures.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了批量赌徒实验，并考虑了在实现停止时间、分配概率和目标参数的条件下进行推断的问题，其中所有这些可能都是根据实验的最后一批信息进行自适应选择的。在没有对实验进行进一步限制的情况下，我们证明仅使用最后一批结果进行推断是最优的。当实验的自适应方面被认为是位置不变的，即当我们将所有批次-臂的平均值都向一个常数移动时，我们证明数据中还存在额外的信息，可以通过一个额外的批次-臂均值的线性函数来捕捉。在更严格的情况下，停止时间、分配概率和目标参数被认为仅依赖于数据通过一个多面体事件的集合，我们推导出了计算可行且最优的条件推断程序。",
