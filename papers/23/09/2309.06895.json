This is particularly noticeable in portrait image generation, where any unnatural artifact in human faces is easily discernible due to our inherent human bias. To address this, we introduce MagiCapture, a personalization method for integrating subject and style concepts to generate high-resolution portrait images using just a few subject and style references. For instance, given a handful of random selfies, our fine-tuned model can generate high-quality portrait images in specific styles, such as passport or profil",

    "translated_abstract": "大规模的文本到图像模型，包括稳定扩散，能够生成高保真度的逼真人像照片。有一个专门研究个性化这些模型的领域，旨在使用提供的参考图像集合合成特定主题或风格。然而，尽管这些个性化方法产生的结果令人满意，但其生成的图像往往缺乏真实感，并且尚未达到商业可行的水平。在人像图像生成中尤为明显，因为由于我们内在的人类偏见，人脸中的任何不自然的痕迹都很容易被识别出来。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了MagiCapture，一种个性化方法，用于将主题和风格概念融合，仅使用几个主题和风格参考即可生成高分辨率的人像图像。例如，给定一些随机的自拍照，我们经过调优的模型就可以生成特定风格（如护照或个人资料）的高质量人像图像。",
