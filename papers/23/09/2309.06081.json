    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in healthcare and other domains due to their ability to process multi-modal and multi-relational graphs. However, efficient training of GNNs remains challenging, with several open research questions. In this paper, we investigate how the flow of embedding information within GNNs affects the prediction of links in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Specifically, we propose a mathematical model that decouples the GNN connectivity from the connectivity of the graph data and evaluate the performance of GNNs in a clinical triage use case. Our results demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge into the GNN connectivity leads to better performance than using the same connectivity as the KG or allowing unconstrained embedding propagation. Moreover, we show that negative edges play a crucial role in achieving good predictions, and that using too many GNN layers can degrade performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）由于能够处理多模态和多关系图而在医疗保健等领域引起了广泛关注。然而，GNNs的有效训练仍然具有挑战性，存在一些未解决的研究问题。本文研究了嵌入信息在GNNs内部传播如何影响知识图谱（KGs）中链接的预测。具体而言，我们提出了一个数学模型，将GNN的连接性与图数据的连接性解耦，并在临床分诊应用案例中评估了GNNs的性能。我们的结果表明，将领域知识纳入到GNN的连接性中比使用与KG相同的连接性或允许无限制的嵌入传播导致更好的性能。此外，我们还证明了负边在实现良好预测中起到了至关重要的作用，并且使用太多的GNN层会降低性能。",
