    "translated_abstract": "通过识别连续输入之间的相似性，自监督学习方法在时间序列分析中展示了其编码时间数据固有静态特征的有效性。然而，对相似性的独家关注可能导致忽视对模拟心血管疾病建模至关重要的动态属性的表示。本文介绍了一种名为Distilled Encoding Beyond Similarities (DEBS)的自监督学习方法，通过整合正例对之间的不相似性，超越了简单的相似性。该框架被应用于心电图(ECG)信号，提高了不同被试中房颤(AFib)检测准确度的10%。DEBS强调通过在优化过程中利用不相似性来编码时间序列数据的动态特征，实现更精细的表示的潜力。总的来说，本研究开拓了一种在自监督学习中利用正例对不相似性的方法，有助于提高时间序列数据的编码质量。",
