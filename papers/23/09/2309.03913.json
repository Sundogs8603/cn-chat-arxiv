    "abstract": "Pure Edge computing (PEC) aims to bring cloud applications and services to the edge of the network to support the growing user demand for time-sensitive applications and data-driven computing. However, mobility and limited computational capacity of edge devices pose challenges in supporting some urgent and computationally intensive tasks with strict response time demands. If the execution results of these tasks exceed the deadline, they become worthless and can cause severe safety issues. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that edge nodes complete as many latency-sensitive tasks as possible. \\\\In this paper, we propose a Robust Adaptive Workload Orchestration (R-AdWOrch) model to minimize deadline misses and data loss by using priority definition and a reallocation strategy. The results show that R-AdWOrch can minimize deadline misses of urgent tasks while minimizing the data loss of lower priority tasks under all conditions.",

    "translated_abstract": "纯边缘计算旨在将云应用和服务带到网络边缘，以支持不断增长的用户对时态应用和数据驱动计算的需求。然而，边缘设备的移动性和有限的计算能力对于支持一些紧急和计算密集型任务且具有严格响应时间要求的任务带来挑战。如果这些任务的执行结果超过了截止时间，它们就变得毫无价值，并且可能导致严重的安全问题。因此，确保边缘节点尽可能完成尽可能多的低延迟任务是非常重要的。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种稳健的纯边缘计算工作负载编排（R-AdWOrch）模型，通过使用优先级定义和重新分配策略，最小化截止时间的未达成以及低优先级任务的数据丢失。实验结果显示，R-AdWOrch能够在所有条件下尽量减少紧急任务的截止时间未达成和低优先级任务的数据丢失。"
