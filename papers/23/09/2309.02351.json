    "translated_abstract": "实际物理系统通常可以通过连续时间动力系统来描述。在实际应用中，真实系统通常是未知的，需要从测量数据中学习。由于数据通常以离散时间收集，例如通过传感器，高斯过程（GP）动力模型学习中的大多数方法都是针对一步预测进行训练的。在一些场景中，这可能会导致问题，例如如果测量结果以不规则的时间步长提供，或者物理系统属性需要保持不变。因此，我们的目标是建立对真实连续时间动力学的GP模型。高阶数值积分器提供了通过任意精度离散化动力学函数来解决这个问题的工具。许多高阶积分器需要在中间时间步骤进行动力学评估，这使得精确的GP推断变得难以处理。在先前的工作中，通常通过使用变分推断来近似GP后验来解决这个问题。然而，精确的GP推断是很困难的。",
