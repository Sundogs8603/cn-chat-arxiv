    "translated_abstract": "生成型大型语言模型（LLM）的出现，如ChatGPT，在多个领域催生了变革性的进展。然而，随着这些进展的同时，它们也引入了潜在的威胁。其中一个关键问题是滥用LLM生成虚假信息的传播者，利用这些模型生成高度有说服力但具有误导性的内容，挑战虚假信息检测系统。此项工作旨在通过回答三个研究问题来解决这个问题：（1）现有的虚假信息检测技术能够可靠地检测LLM生成的虚假信息的程度是多少？ （2）如果传统技术证明效果较差，LLM本身是否可以被利用作为对抗先进虚假信息的强大防御？ （3）如果这两种策略都失效，可以提出什么新的方法来有效应对这个日益严重的威胁？对于虚假信息的形成和检测进行了整体探索来推动这一行",
