    "translated_abstract": "机器翻译（MT）是自然语言处理（NLP）中最重要的任务之一，它涉及将文本从一种自然语言自动转换为另一种语言，同时保持其含义和流畅性。尽管机器翻译的研究已经持续了数十年，但将深度学习技术与自然语言处理结合的新方法从根本上改善了翻译质量。在本文中，我们通过训练Transformer模型开发了一种神经机器翻译（NMT）系统，用于将印度语Hindi文本翻译成英文。Hindi作为一种资源稀缺的语言，使得神经网络难以理解该语言，从而导致神经机器翻译器的发展缓慢。因此，为了弥补这一差距，我们实施了回译来增加训练数据，并通过实验使用了词级和子词级的分词方法创建了词汇表。",
