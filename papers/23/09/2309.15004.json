    "translated_abstract": "问题式活动（QBA）在教育中得到广泛应用，传统上是学习和评估过程的一个重要组成部分。本文设计并评估了一个用于学校形成性和总结性评估的自动化问题生成工具。通过对104名教师的专家调查，我们展示了自动化生成QBA的需求，作为一个能够显著减轻教师工作量并促进个性化学习体验的工具。利用生成型AI的最新进展，我们提出了一个基于Transformer的语言模型的模块化框架，用于从文本内容中自动生成多项选择题（MCQ）。所提出的解决方案具有问题生成、正确答案预测和干扰项制定的不同模块，使我们能够评估不同的语言模型和生成技术。最后，我们进行了广泛的定量和定性评估。",
