Whenever the diffusion process is unobserved, the number of possible realizations of the latent matrix that captures agents' diffusion statuses grows exponentially with the size of network. Due to interdependencies, the log likelihood function can not be factorized in individual components. As a consequence, exact estimation of latent diffusion models with more than one round of interaction is computationally infeasible. In the present paper, I propose a trimming estimator that enables me to establish and maximize an approximate log likelihood function that almost exactly identifies the peak of the true log likelihood function whenever no more than one third of eligible agents are subject to trimming.",

    "translated_abstract": "网络扩散模型适用于许多社会经济交互，然而网络交互很难观察或测量。每当扩散过程未被观察时，捕捉代理人扩散状态的潜在矩阵可能的实现数量随着网络规模呈指数增长。由于相互依赖关系，对超过一轮交互的潜在扩散模型进行精确估计在计算上是不可行的。在本文中，我提出了一个修剪估计器，使我能够建立和最大化一个近似的对数似然函数，该函数几乎能够准确识别出真实对数似然函数的峰值，只要不超过三分之一的符合条件的代理人被修剪。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一个修剪估计器，用于解决更复杂的潜在扩散模型的估计问题，该估计器可以近似最大化对数似然函数并准确识别峰值，具有较好的计算可行性。"
