    "abstract": "We propose a decoder-only language model, VoxtLM, that can perform four tasks: speech recognition, speech synthesis, text generation, and speech continuation. VoxtLM integrates text vocabulary with discrete speech tokens from self-supervised speech features and uses special tokens to enable multitask learning. Compared to a single-task model, VoxtLM exhibits a significant improvement in speech synthesis, with improvements in both speech intelligibility from 28.9 to 5.6 and objective quality from 2.68 to 3.90. VoxtLM also improves speech generation and speech recognition performance over the single-task counterpart. VoxtLM is trained with publicly available data and training recipes and model checkpoints will be open-sourced to make fully reproducible work.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个只解码语言模型VoxtLM，能够执行四个任务：语音识别、语音合成、文本生成和语音延续。VoxtLM将文本词汇与自监督语音特征中的离散语音令牌进行整合，并使用特殊令牌实现多任务学习。与单任务模型相比，VoxtLM在语音合成方面显示了显著的改善，语音可理解性从28.9提高到5.6，客观质量从2.68提高到3.90。VoxtLM还改善了语音生成和语音识别性能。VoxtLM使用公开可用的数据进行训练，并将提供训练脚本和模型检查点的开源代码，以实现完全可复现的工作。",
