    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）已经成为工业领域中的一种流行工具，它有助于改善操作、增加效率和降低成本。然而，在生产环境中部署和管理ML模型可能会很复杂。这就是机器学习运营（MLOps）的作用所在。MLOps旨在简化部署和管理过程。其中一个尚未解决的MLOps挑战是对解释的需求。这些解释对于理解ML模型的推理过程至关重要，这对于信任和接受是关键的。更好地识别错误和提高模型准确性只是其中的两个结果优势。一个经常被忽视的事实是，当准确性，尤其是可解释性不满足用户期望时，部署的模型在实践中会被绕过。我们开发了一种新颖的MLOps软件架构，以解决将解释和反馈能力整合到ML开发和部署过程中的挑战。在项目EXPLAIN中，我们的架构被应用于工业应用中。",
