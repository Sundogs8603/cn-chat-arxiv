Many CQA forums such as Quora, Stackoverflow, Yahoo!Answer, StackExchange exist with a lot of user-generated data.

In this work, we empirically investigate a few aspects of this domain. Firstly, in addition to traditional features like TF-IDF, BM25 etc., we introduce a BERT-based feature that captures the semantic similarity between the question and answer.

We combine both types of features in a linear fashion. Thirdly, using our proposed concepts, we conduct an empirical investigation with different rank-lea",

    "translated_abstract": "社区问答（CQA）论坛是基于互联网的平台，用户在这里提出问题，其他专家用户试图提供解决方案。许多CQA论坛，如Quora，Stackoverflow，Yahoo！Answer，StackExchange等都有大量用户生成的数据。这些数据在自动化的CQA排名系统中得到利用，以回应用户的查询，呈现类似的问题（和答案）。在这项工作中，我们经验性地调查了该领域的一些方面。首先，除了传统的特征如TF-IDF、BM25等，我们引入了基于BERT的特征，捕捉问题和答案之间的语义相似性。其次，大部分现有研究工作都集中在仅从问题部分提取的特征上，尚未广泛探索从答案中提取的特征。我们以线性方式结合了两种类型的特征。第三，使用我们提出的概念，我们对不同排名算法进行了经验性的研究。",
