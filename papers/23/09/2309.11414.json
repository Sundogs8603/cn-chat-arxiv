    "translated_abstract": "传统的机器人操纵运动规划包括一组通用算法，旨在最小化执行给定计划的特定于场景的成本。这种方法具有显著的适应性，因为它们可以直接使用于任何新场景，无需特定的训练数据集。然而，如果没有对多样有效轨迹有先验了解，并且没有针对给定场景设计的成本函数，解决方案的成功率往往较低。虽然基于深度学习的算法极大地提高了成功率，但没有专门的训练数据集很难应用。我们提出了EDMP，一种基于成本引导的扩散运动规划集成，旨在结合传统和基于深度学习的运动规划的优势。我们的扩散网络在一组多样化的运动学有效轨迹上进行训练。与传统规划一样，在推断时对于任何新场景，我们计算特定于场景的成本函数。",
