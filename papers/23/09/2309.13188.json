    "translated_abstract": "无配对的图像转换的一个共同目标是在模仿目标域的风格的同时保持源图像和转换后图像之间的内容一致性。由于两个域的数据集之间存在偏差，许多方法在转换过程中会产生不一致性。大多数方法用于缓解这些不一致性的方法没有对判别器进行限制，导致训练设置更加无法确定。此外，这些方法都不适用于更大的裁剪尺寸。在这项工作中，我们展示了通过使用基于内容的遮罩对两个域的全局判别器的输入进行遮盖可以显著减少内容不一致性。然而，这种策略会导致可以追溯到遮罩过程的伪影。为了减少这些伪影，我们引入了一种在使用相似性采样策略选择的小裁剪对上操作的局部判别器。此外，我们还将这种采样策略应用于全局采样。",
