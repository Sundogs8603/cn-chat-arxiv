    "abstract": "The spread of the coronavirus pandemic had negative repercussions on the majority of transport systems in virtually all countries. After the lockdown period, travel restriction policies are now frequently adapted almost real-time according to observed trends in the spread of the disease, resulting in a rapidly changing transport market situation.

Within this framework, the present paper investigates how different COVID-19 restriction levels have affected the usage patterns of shared micromobility.  Usage data of two dockless micromobility services (bike and e-scooters) operating in Turin (Italy) are analyzed between October 2020 and March 2021, a period characterized by different travel restriction levels.

    "translated_abstract": "新冠疫情的传播对几乎所有国家的大多数交通系统产生了负面影响。封锁期过后，根据疫情传播趋势的观察，旅行限制政策现在几乎实时地经常调整，导致交通市场形势迅速变化。依赖顾客的共享微型交通运营商需要理解需求如何受到影响以调整运营。在这个背景下，本文研究了不同的COVID-19限制级别如何影响共享微型交通的使用模式。分析了2020年10月至2021年3月在意大利都灵运营的两种无桩微型交通服务（自行车和电动滑板车）的使用数据，这一时期有不同的旅行限制级别。对两种服务的平均每日出行次数、出行距离和出行时长进行了获取，并进行了比较。",
