    "translated_abstract": "机器学习是主流技术的核心，优于手工特征设计的传统方法。除了对人工特征提取的学习过程外，它具有从输入到输出的端到端范 Paradigm，可以实现非常准确的结果。然而，关于其对恶意和难以察觉的扰动的稳健性的安全问题已经引起了关注，因为其预测可能会完全改变。显著目标检测是一个研究领域，深度卷积神经网络在其中已被证明非常有效，但其可信性代表了一个需要分析和解决黑客攻击的重要问题。脑程序设计是一种符号学习方法，在传统的人工智能中是非常重要的。这项工作提供了证据，表明符号学习的鲁棒性对于设计可靠的视觉注意系统至关重要，因为它可以经受住最强烈的扰动。我们测试了这种进化计算方法论。",
