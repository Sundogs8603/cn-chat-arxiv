    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）是目前人工智能领域最受欢迎的技术之一，因其协作学习和保护客户隐私的能力而受到青睐。然而，它面临非独立和非独立分布（非IID）以及本地客户之间标签不平衡等挑战。为了解决这些限制，研究团队探索了各种方法，如使用本地模型参数、联邦生成对抗学习和联邦表示学习。在我们的研究中，我们提出了一种基于已发表的Stacked Federated Learning（FedStack）框架的新颖Clustered FedStack框架。本地客户端将其模型预测和输出层权重发送到服务器，然后构建一个强大的全局模型。这个全局模型使用聚类机制基于其输出层权重对本地客户进行聚类。我们采用了三种聚类机制，分别是K-Means、Agglomerative、DBSCAN。",
