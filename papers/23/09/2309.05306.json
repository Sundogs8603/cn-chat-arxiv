    "translated_abstract": "由于脑结构形状和信号强度变化较大反映胎儿发育过程的变化，新生儿MRI图像的脑分割是一项非常具有挑战性的任务。在这种背景下，需要具有对图像对比度变化和解剖结构的空间配置的鲁棒性的分割技术。在这项工作中，我们评估了合成学习的潜力，即使用从非常少数受试者的地面真实标签生成的合成图像训练的独立于对比度的模型。我们基于发展性人类连接组计划发布的数据集进行实验，该数据集提供了超过700名26至45周孕龄的婴儿的高质量T1和T2加权图像。首先，我们证实了仅基于少数T2加权体积训练的标准Unet的令人印象深刻的性能，但也证实了这类模型学习特定于训练域的强度相关特征。然后我们进一步评估了许多基于合成学习的改进策略。",

Experiment results show the impressive performance of the standard Unet model on a few T2-weighted volumes, but also highlight the model's reliance on intensity-related features specific to the training domain."
