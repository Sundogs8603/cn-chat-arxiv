    "translated_abstract": "许多数学模型已被利用来设计嵌入，以表示知识图谱（KG）中的实体和关系，用于链接预测和许多下游任务。这些数学启发的模型不仅在大型KG中进行推理时高度可扩展，而且在建模不同关系模式方面具有很多可解释的优势，这些优势可以通过形式化证明和经验结果来验证。在本文中，我们对KG完成领域的当前研究状态进行了全面的概述。特别是，我们着重介绍了KG嵌入（KGE）设计的两个主要分支：1）基于距离的方法和2）基于语义匹配的方法。我们发现了最近提出的模型之间的联系，并提出了一个潜在的趋势，这可能有助于研究人员发明新颖且更有效的模型。接下来，我们深入探讨了从2D和3D仿射操作中汲取灵感的CompoundE和CompoundE3D。它们涵盖了包括dis在内的广泛技术谓词的范围。",
