ReConcile enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by holding multiple rounds of discussion, learning to convince other agents to improve their answers, and employing a confidence-weighted voting mechanism.

This discussion prompt enables each agent to revise their responses in light of insights from other agents. Once a consensus is reached and the discussion ends, ReConcil",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）仍然在复杂的推理任务上遇到困难。受到心智社会理论（Minsky, 1988）的启发，我们提出了ReConcile，这是一个多模型多代理的框架，旨在通过多样的LLM代理人之间的圆桌会议来促进多样的思想和讨论，从而改进一致性。ReConcile通过进行多轮讨论、学习说服其他代理人改进答案以及采用置信度加权投票机制来增强LLM的推理能力。在每一轮中，ReConcile通过“讨论提示”来启动代理人间的讨论，其中包括上一轮每个代理人生成的答案和解释的分组、它们的不确定性以及用于说服其他代理人的答案修正人类解释的演示。这个讨论提示使每个代理人能够根据其他代理人的见解修订自己的回答。一旦达成一致并结束讨论，ReConcile执行一次全体投票以确定最终答案。",
