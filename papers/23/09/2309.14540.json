    "abstract": "This research aims to evaluate the performance of the rotors and study the behavior of the human driver in interacting with the rotors. In recent years, rotors have been increasingly used between countries due to their safety, capacity, and environmental advantages, and because they provide safe and fluid flows of vehicles for transit and integration. It turns out that roundabouts can significantly reduce speed at twisting intersections, entry speed and the resulting effect on speed depends on the rating of road users. In our research, (bus, car, truck) drivers were given special attention and their behavior was categorized into (conservative, normal, aggressive). Anticipating and recognizing driver behavior is an important challenge. Therefore, the aim of this research is to study the effect of roundabouts on these classifiers and to develop a method for predicting the behavior of road users at roundabout intersections. Safety is primarily due to two inherent features of the rotor. Fi",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在评估圆环的性能并研究人类驾驶员与圆环的互动行为。近年来，由于其安全性、容量和环境优势以及为过境和整合提供安全和流畅车辆流动，圆环在国家间的应用越来越多。结果表明，圆环可以显著降低转弯路口的速度、入口速度以及其对速度的影响取决于道路使用者的行为评级。在我们的研究中，（巴士、汽车、卡车）驾驶员受到特别关注，并将其行为分为保守型、正常型和侵略型。预测和识别驾驶员行为是一个重要的挑战。因此，本研究旨在研究圆环对这些分类器的影响，并开发一种预测圆环交叉口道路使用者行为的方法。安全主要归功于圆环的两个固有特征。",
