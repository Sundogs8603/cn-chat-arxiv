    "translated_abstract": "电信号图（ECG或EKG）是一种测量心脏电活动的医学测试。ECG常用于诊断和监测各种心脏疾病，包括心律失常、心肌梗塞和心力衰竭。然而，传统的ECG需要临床测量，限制了其在医疗机构的应用。相比之下，单导联ECG已经在佩戴式设备上应用广泛。另一种ECG的替代方法是光浊度脉搏检测（PPG），它采用非侵入性、低成本的光学方法来测量心脏生理学，使其成为捕捉日常生活中重要心脏信号的合适选择。虽然ECG和PPG之间具有强烈的相关性，但后者并没有提供明显的临床诊断价值。在这里，我们提出了一种不受个体限制的基于注意力的深度状态空间模型，用于将PPG信号转换为ECG，从而实现连续性心房颤动检测。",
