    "translated_title": "一次对话胜过千万的推荐：综述综合对话推荐系统",
    "translated_abstract": "对话式推荐系统通过交互过程生成推荐。然而，并非所有对话式推荐系统方法都使用人类对话作为交互数据源；先前的大部分对话式推荐系统工作通过交换实体级信息来模拟交互。因此，先前的对话式推荐系统工作无法适用于真实世界场景中的对话，其中对话会出现意外转变，或者对话和意图理解并非完美。为了解决这一挑战，研究界已经开始研究综合对话式推荐系统，这些系统使用从真实场景中收集到的对话数据进行训练。尽管这些综合方法已经出现，但其尚未充分探索。我们通过结构化方式总结文献，对综合对话式推荐系统方法进行全面调查。调查将综合对话式推荐系统方法分为三个组成部分：1）骨干语言模型，可选使用2）外部知识和/或3）外部指导。",
    "tldr": "该论文综述了综合对话式推荐系统的方法，传统方法无法应用于真实世界场景，该论文提出了一种新的方法，即使用真实对话数据进行训练。"
