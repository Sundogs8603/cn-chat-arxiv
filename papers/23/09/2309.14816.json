    "translated_abstract": "一个人的实际年龄和生物年龄之间的差异可以成为神经退行性疾病的重要生物标志物，因此在临床环境中，大脑年龄估计至关重要。将多模态信息纳入该估计的一种方法是通过人口图，它结合了各种类型的成像数据，并捕捉了人群内个体之间的关联。在医学成像中，人口图已经显示出有望的结果，主要用于分类任务。在大多数情况下，图结构是预先定义好的，并且在训练过程中保持静态。然而，提取人口图是一项非常复杂的任务，它可以显著影响对于图神经网络（GNNs）的性能，因为GNNs对于图结构非常敏感。在这项工作中，我们强调了有意义的图构建的重要性，并尝试了不同的人口图构建方法，并研究了它们对于大脑年龄估计中GNN性能的影响。",
