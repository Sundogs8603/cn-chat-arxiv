    "abstract": "Real-world production systems often grapple with maintaining data quality in large-scale, dynamic streams. We introduce Drifter, an efficient and lightweight system for online feature monitoring and verification in recommendation use cases. Drifter addresses limitations of existing methods by delivering agile, responsive, and adaptable data quality monitoring, enabling real-time root cause analysis, drift detection and insights into problematic production events. Integrating state-of-the-art online feature ranking for sparse data and anomaly detection ideas, Drifter is highly scalable and resource-efficient, requiring only two threads and less than a gigabyte of RAM per production deployments that handle millions of instances per minute. Evaluation on real-world data sets demonstrates Drifter's effectiveness in alerting and mitigating data quality issues, substantially improving reliability and performance of real-time live recommender systems.",
