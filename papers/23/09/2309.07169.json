    "translated_abstract": "拓扑信号处理(TSP)利用单纯形复合来建模比顶点和边更高阶的结构。本文研究了TSP的可转移性，通过一种称为复合子的广义高阶图的版本。我们回顾了复合子的概念，即单纯形复合序列的极限[1]。受图移位算子的积分算子形式的启发，我们根据复合子的所有可能尺寸的组件构造了边际复合子和复合移位算子(CSO)。我们研究了CSO的特征值和特征向量，并将它们与一类新的加权邻接矩阵相关联。我们证明，当一个单纯形复合序列收敛到一个复合子时，相应的CSO的特征值收敛到极限复合子的特征值。这些结果暗示了在大型单纯形复合或单纯形复合序列上的学习可转移性，从而推广了图信号处理框架。",
