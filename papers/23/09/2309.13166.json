    "translated_abstract": "在图像领域中，由于其数据生成和转换的能力，扩散模型在各种任务中取得了最先进的性能，因此在图像和音频领域都备受重视。在迅速发展的音频机器学习领域，保护模型的完整性和确立数据的版权至关重要。本文提出了一种首次应用于训练在mel频谱图上的音频扩散模型的水印技术，这对上述挑战提供了一种新颖的方法。我们的模型不仅在正常音频生成方面表现出色，而且还引入了一个不可见的水印触发机制来进行模型验证。这个水印触发器作为一种保护层，能够识别模型的所有者并确保其完整性。通过大量实验证明，不可见的水印触发器在防止未经授权的修改的同时还能保持高效的合法音频传输。",
