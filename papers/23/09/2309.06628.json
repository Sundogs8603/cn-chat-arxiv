    "translated_abstract": "嵌入解析器的神经网络是一种利用多种真实性数据源进行航空航天工程系统高效设计探索的神经网络类型。使用不同的随机初始化训练多个神经网络模型实现。模型实现的集成用于评估由于缺乏训练样本而引起的认知建模的不确定性。这种不确定性估计是航空航天系统设计探索中成功目标导向自适应学习的关键信息。然而，训练集成模型的成本通常变得难以承受，并且在自适应学习期间，特别是当模型不是并行训练时，会带来计算挑战。在这项工作中，提出了一种使用快速神经网络范式的新型嵌入解析器的神经网络。与传统的神经网络训练不同，该方法通过使用基于梯度的方法仅优化所有网络层的权重和偏置。",
