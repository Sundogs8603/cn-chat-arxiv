    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习中的许多应用中，例如数据汇总、信息传播等，非单调k-次模子模块化最大化问题（$\\kSMK$）在底层集合大小$n$上被提出。然而，现有算法面临如何克服非单调情况以及在数据大小大的情况下如何快速返回一个好解的问题。本文引入了两个确定性逼近算法，竞争性地改进了现有算法的查询复杂度。我们的第一个算法$\\LAA$在$O(nk)$的查询复杂度内返回了$1/19$的近似比。第二个算法$\\RLA$在$O(nk)$的查询中改进了近似比率到$1/5-\\epsilon$，其中$\\epsilon$是一个输入参数。我们的算法是第一个在非单调目标函数中仅使用$O(nk)$查询复杂度提供恒定近似比率的算法。因此，它们需要更少的查询次数。",
