    "abstract": "We propose a method for adapting neural networks to distribution shifts at test-time. In contrast to training-time robustness mechanisms that attempt to anticipate and counter the shift, we create a closed-loop system and make use of a test-time feedback signal to adapt a network on the fly. We show that this loop can be effectively implemented using a learning-based function, which realizes an amortized optimizer for the network. This leads to an adaptation method, named Rapid Network Adaptation (RNA), that is notably more flexible and orders of magnitude faster than the baselines. Through a broad set of experiments using various adaptation signals and target tasks, we study the efficiency and flexibility of this method. We perform the evaluations using various datasets (Taskonomy, Replica, ScanNet, Hypersim, COCO, ImageNet), tasks (depth, optical flow, semantic segmentation, classification), and distribution shifts (Cross-datasets, 2D and 3D Common Corruptions) with promising results",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种在测试时适应分布变化的神经网络方法。与试训练时的鲁棒性机制不同，试图预测和对抗变化，我们创建了一个闭环系统，并利用测试时的反馈信号实时调整网络。我们展示了使用基于学习的函数，实现了网络的一种摊销优化器，从而实现了一种名为快速网络适应(RNA)的适应方法，它比基准方法更加灵活且快速数个数量级。通过使用各种适应信号和目标任务进行广泛的实验，我们研究了该方法的效率和灵活性。我们使用了各种数据集(Taskonomy、Replica、ScanNet、Hypersim、COCO、ImageNet)，任务(深度、光流、语义分割、分类)和分布变化(Cross-datasets、2D和3D Common Corruptions)进行了评估，并取得了令人满意的结果。",
