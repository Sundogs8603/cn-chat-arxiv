    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了大规模AI自动化是否能够使全球经济增长加速达到约一个数量级，类似于工业革命所带来的经济增长效应。我们确定了这种增长的三个主要驱动因素：1）AI“劳动力”的可扩展性使得规模递增再现，2）AI劳动力的快速扩张，以及3）在短时间内进行的快速自动化带来的产出大幅增加。在这个背景下，我们评估了九个反对论点，包括监管障碍、产能瓶颈、匹配问题和自动化的速度。我们暂时评估了这些论点，发现大多数都不太可能成为决定因素。我们得出结论认为，如果AI能够广泛替代人力劳动，爆炸性增长似乎是有可能的，但目前对这一说法的高度自信似乎是不合理的。关于AI监管响应的强度、生产中的物理瓶颈和AI的经济价值，仍然存在关键问题。",
