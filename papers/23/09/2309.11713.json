    "translated_abstract": "Monte Carlo (MC)方法被用作计算切片Wasserstein (SW)距离的标准方法，因为它在分析形式中具有棘手的期望。然而，MC方法在最小化绝对近似误差方面并不优化。为了提供更好的经验SW类，我们提出了基于准蒙特卡洛（QMC）方法的准切片Wasserstein（QSW）逼近。为了对SW的QMC进行全面的研究，我们专注于三维设置，特别是计算三维概率测度之间的SW。具体而言，我们通过实证验证了在三维单位超球面上构造QMC点集的多种方法，包括基于高斯的映射，等面积映射，广义螺旋点和最优化差异能量。此外，为了获得随机优化的无偏估计，我们通过在所讨论的低维设置中引入随机性，将QSW扩展为随机准切片Wasserstein（RQSW）。",
