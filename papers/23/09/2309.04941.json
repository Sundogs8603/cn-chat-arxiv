    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）的能力在广泛的任务中成功计数特定的图子结构，尤其是循环，对于GNNs的成功非常关键。最近，它已被用作评估GNNs表达能力的一种常用指标。许多具有可证明的循环计数能力的GNN模型都基于子图GNNs，即从输入图中提取一组子图，为每个子图生成表示，并使用它们来增强输入图的表示。然而，这些方法需要进行繁重的预处理，并且时间和内存成本较高。在本文中，我们通过提出一种新的GNN类别-- $d$-Distance-Restricted FWL(2) GNNs，或者 $d$-DRFWL(2) GNNs，克服了子图GNNs的上述限制。$d$-DRFWL(2) GNNs将互相之间距离不超过$d$的节点对作为信息传递的单位，以平衡表达能力和复杂性。",
