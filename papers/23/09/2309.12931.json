    "translated_abstract": "自监督变形器的训练方法在各个领域展现了显著的性能。以往的基于变形器的模型（如遮蔽自编码器）通常会为[CLS]符号和标记使用单独的归一化层。我们在本文中提出了一种简单的修改，为标记和[CLS]符号分别使用归一化层，以更好地捕捉它们各自的特点并增强下游任务的性能。我们的方法旨在缓解将相同的归一化统计数据应用于两种标记类型可能带来的负面效果，这些统计数据可能无法与它们各自的角色最佳匹配。通过使用单独的归一化层，我们经验证明[CLS]嵌入能够更好地编码全局语境信息，并在其非各向同性空间中分布更均匀。当用这两个单独的归一化层替换常规的归一化层时，我们观察到平均性能提升了2.7%。",
