    "translated_abstract": "在最近几年，两个时间序列分类模型ROCKET和MINIROCKET因其低训练成本和最先进的准确性而受到广泛关注。ROCKET和MINIROCKET利用无需训练的随机一维卷积核，可以快速从时间序列数据中提取特征，从而实现线性分类器的高效拟合。然而，为了全面捕捉有用的特征，需要大量的随机卷积核，这对于资源受限的设备来说是不兼容的。因此，我们设计了一种启发式进化算法S-ROCKET，用于识别和剪枝冗余的卷积核。然而，进化算法本身的特性导致在S-ROCKET中评估卷积核是一个耗时的过程。本文中，与直接评估具有非显著差异的随机卷积核的S-ROCKET不同，我们从特征选择的角度删除卷积核，通过消除序列中的相关连接来实现。",
