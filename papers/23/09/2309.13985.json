    "translated_abstract": "在科学和工程领域部署机器学习估计器时，避免失败的估计是至关重要的，因为它可能会产生灾难性后果，例如在航空发动机设计中。本文重点在于利用模拟和受物理定律指导的性能指标，在采用SAE逆问题时检测和纠正失败的状态估计。我们建议在其物理模型误差超过可行阈值时标记机器学习估计，并提出了一种新方法GEESE来通过优化来纠正，旨在提供低误差和高效性。GEESE的关键设计包括（1）混合代理误差模型，以提供快速的误差估计以减少模拟成本，并实现基于梯度的误差反馈传播，以及（2）两个生成模型，以近似候选状态的概率分布，用于模拟开发和探索行为。这三个模型是协同的。",
