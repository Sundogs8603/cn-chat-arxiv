    "abstract": "We propose an ensemble method to improve the generalization performance of trading strategies trained by deep reinforcement learning algorithms in a highly stochastic environment of intraday cryptocurrency portfolio trading. We adopt a model selection method that evaluates on multiple validation periods, and propose a novel mixture distribution policy to effectively ensemble the selected models. We provide a distributional view of the out-of-sample performance on granular test periods to demonstrate the robustness of the strategies in evolving market conditions, and retrain the models periodically to address non-stationarity of financial data. Our proposed ensemble method improves the out-of-sample performance compared with the benchmarks of a deep reinforcement learning strategy and a passive investment strategy.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种集成方法，以改善深度强化学习算法在日内加密货币投资组合交易中的高度随机环境中的交易策略的泛化性能。我们采用了一种模型选择方法，在多个验证期间进行评估，并提出了一种新颖的混合分布策略来有效集成所选模型。我们提供了对精细测试期间的样本外表现的分布视角，以展示策略在不断变化的市场条件下的鲁棒性，并定期重新训练模型以应对金融数据的非稳定性。我们提出的集成方法相比于深度强化学习策略和被动投资策略的基准模型改善了样本外的表现。",
