    "abstract": "The paper examined the impact of agricultural credit on economic growth in Bangladesh. The annual data of agriculture credit were collected from annual reports of the Bangladesh Bank and other data were collected from the world development indicator (WDI) of the World Bank. By employing Johansen cointegration test and vector error correction model (VECM), the study revealed that there exists a long run relationship between the variables. The results of the study showed that agriculture credit had a positive impact on GDP growth in Bangladesh. The study also found that gross capital formation had a positive, while inflation had a negative association with economic growth in Bangladesh. Therefore, the government and policymakers should continue their effort to increase the volume of agriculture credit to achieve sustainable economic growth.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了农业信贷对孟加拉国经济增长的影响。采用孟加拉国银行的年度报告收集的农业信贷数据以及世界银行的世界发展指标（WDI）等其他数据。通过采用约翰森协整检验和向量误差修正模型(VECM)，研究发现变量之间存在长期关系。研究结果表明，农业信贷对孟加拉国的GDP增长产生了积极的影响。研究还发现，总固定资本形成与经济增长呈正相关，而通货膨胀与经济增长呈负相关。因此，政府和决策者应继续努力增加农业信贷规模，以实现可持续的经济增长。",
