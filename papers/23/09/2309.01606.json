    "translated_abstract": "中文地理重新排序任务旨在在检索到的候选地址中找到最相关的地址，这对于导航地图等与位置相关的服务至关重要。与一般的语句不同，地理上下文与地理概念紧密相连，从一般的片段（如省份）到特定的片段（如道路）。基于此特点，我们提出了一个创新的框架，名为Geo-Encoder，将中文地理语义更有效地集成到重新排序流程中。我们的方法是通过使用现成的工具将文本与地理范围相关联，将它们作为分块单元。然后，我们提出了一个多任务学习模块，同时获取一个有效的注意力矩阵，以确定块对额外语义表示的贡献。此外，我们还提出了异步更新机制，用于提出的附加任务，旨在引导模型能够有效集中注意力在特定的块上。在实验中",
