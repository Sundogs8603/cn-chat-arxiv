    "translated_abstract": "在实际应用中部署分类器时，用户希望它们能够适当地响应输入。然而，传统的分类器无法处理远离其所训练分布的输入。恶意行为者可以利用这个缺陷，通过进行有针对性的扰动来导致分类器给出错误的输出。拒绝分类方法试图通过允许网络在对输入的置信度较低时拒绝进行分类来解决这个问题。这对于强对抗样本效果很好，但也导致了对轻微扰动图像的拒绝，而直观上这些图像可能是可以正确分类的。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了Reed-Muller聚合网络（RMAggNet），这是一种受到Reed-Muller纠错码启发的分类器，可以纠正和拒绝输入。本文表明，RMAggNet可以在多个不同程度的对抗攻击下，最小化错误并保持很好的正确性。",
