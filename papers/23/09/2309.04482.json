    "translated_abstract": "深度学习已经彻底改变了新材料发现的过程，最先进的模型现在能够仅基于化学组分预测材料性能，从而消除了对材料结构的需求。然而，这种成本效益高的方法导致了模型精确度的权衡。具体而言，基于化学组分的材料性能预测模型（CPMs）的准确度显著落后于基于结构的材料性能预测模型（SPMs）。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种创新的师生（T-S）策略，其中预训练的 SPM 充当“老师”，以提高 CPM 的准确性。利用师生策略，T-S CrabNet 已经成为目前 CPM 中最准确的模型。首先，我们证明了这种策略的普适性。在 Materials Project（MP）和 Jarvis 数据集上，我们验证了 T-S 策略在提高 CPM 准确性方面的有效性。",
