    "abstract": "Deciphering the semantics of animal language has been a grand challenge. This study presents a data-driven investigation into the semantics of dog vocalizations via correlating different sound types with consistent semantics. We first present a new dataset of Shiba Inu sounds, along with contextual information such as location and activity, collected from YouTube with a well-constructed pipeline. The framework is also applicable to other animal species. Based on the analysis of conditioned probability between dog vocalizations and corresponding location and activity, we discover supporting evidence for previous heuristic research on the semantic meaning of various dog sounds. For instance, growls can signify interactions. Furthermore, our study yields new insights that existing word types can be subdivided into finer-grained subtypes and minimal semantic unit for Shiba Inu is word-related. For example, whimper can be subdivided into two types, attention-seeking and discomfort.",

    "translated_abstract": "解析动物语言的语义一直是一个重大挑战。本研究通过将不同声音类型与一致的语义相关联，对狗叫声的语义进行了数据驱动的研究。我们首先提出了一个新的Shiba Inu声音数据集，同时还收集了来自YouTube的上下文信息，如位置和活动，通过一套完善的流程。该框架也适用于其他动物物种。通过研究狗叫声与相应的位置和活动之间的条件概率分析，我们发现了支持以前启发式研究关于不同狗叫声的语义意义的证据。例如，咆哮可以表示互动。此外，我们的研究还得出了新的观点，即现有的词汇类型可以细分为更精细的子类型，对于Shiba Inu来说，最小的语义单元是与词汇相关的。例如，呜咽声可以细分为两种类型，求关注和不适。",
