    "abstract": "Decoding memory content from brain activity during sleep has long been a goal in neuroscience. While spontaneous reactivation of memories during sleep in rodents is known to support memory consolidation and offline learning, capturing memory replay in humans is challenging due to the absence of well-annotated sleep datasets and the substantial differences in neural patterns between wakefulness and sleep. To address these challenges, we designed a novel cognitive neuroscience experiment and collected a comprehensive, well-annotated electroencephalography (EEG) dataset from 52 subjects during both wakefulness and sleep. Leveraging this benchmark dataset, we developed the Universal Sleep Decoder (USD) to align neural representations between wakefulness and sleep across subjects. Our model achieves up to 16.6% top-1 zero-shot accuracy on unseen subjects, comparable to decoding performances using individual sleep data. Furthermore, fine-tuning USD on test subjects enhances decoding accuracy",

    "translated_abstract": "通过脑活动解码睡眠中的记忆内容长期以来一直是神经科学的目标。虽然已知啮齿类动物在睡眠中自发地重新激活记忆以支持记忆巩固和离线学习，但由于缺乏经过完整注释的睡眠数据集以及清醒状态和睡眠状态之间神经模式的巨大差异，捕捉人类的记忆再现是具有挑战性的。为了解决这些挑战，我们设计了一项新颖的认知神经科学实验，并从52名参与者收集了一份全面、完整注释的脑电图（EEG）数据集，涵盖了觉醒和睡眠两种状态。利用这个基准数据集，我们开发了通用睡眠解码器（USD），用于在不同个体间对齐觉醒与睡眠的神经表示。我们的模型在未见过的个体上实现了高达16.6%的top-1零样本准确率，与使用个别睡眠数据进行解码的性能相当。此外，对测试个体的USD进行微调可以提高解码准确性。",

By developing the Universal Sleep Decoder (USD), the researchers achieved comparable decoding accuracy to individual sleep data by aligning neural patterns between wakefulness and sleep across subjects. The study also found that fine-tuning USD on test subjects further improved the decoding accuracy."
