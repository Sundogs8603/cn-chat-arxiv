    "translated_abstract": "提议在外部知识的基础上加强对话响应生成，以产生信息量大且引人入胜的响应。然而，当前的基于知识的对话系统在与人类优先品质的生成响应对齐方面常常存在问题，比如幻觉和缺乏连贯性等。在分析多个语言模型生成的基础上，我们观察到在一个单一的解码过程中存在着多个备选生成响应。这些备选响应相对于解码过程优先考虑的最优响应更加忠实，并且与之前的对话转换具有可比性或更高级别的相关性。为了应对这些挑战并受到这些观察的驱动，我们提出了Polished \\& Informed Candidate Scoring (PICK)，这是一个生成重新评分的框架，使模型能够生成忠实和相关的响应，而无需额外的标记数据或模型调整。",
