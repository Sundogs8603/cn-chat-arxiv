    "translated_abstract": "时间点过程（TPP）在预测或预测事件方面起着重要作用。尽管这些问题已经被广泛研究，但预测同时发生的多个事件可能具有挑战性。例如，一个病人往往会同时因为多种病情被送进医院，类似地，人们购买不止一只股票，而且同时发生多个新闻事件。此外，这些事件不以离散的时间间隔发生，在连续时间领域中预测事件集仍然存在着未解决的问题。简单地扩展现有的TPP模型来解决这个问题，会导致处理指数级数量的事件，或者忽略事件集之间的关联性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于TPP的可扩展和高效的方法来解决这个问题。我们的方法结合了上下文事件嵌入、时间信息和领域特征来建模时间事件集。",
