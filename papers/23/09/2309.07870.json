    "abstract": "Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) enable researchers and developers to build autonomous language agents that can automatically solve various tasks and interact with environments, humans, and other agents using natural language interfaces. We consider language agents as a promising direction towards artificial general intelligence and release Agents, an open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to a wider non-specialist audience. Agents is carefully engineered to support important features including planning, memory, tool usage, multi-agent communication, and fine-grained symbolic control. Agents is user-friendly as it enables non-specialists to build, customize, test, tune, and deploy state-of-the-art autonomous language agents without much coding. The library is also research-friendly as its modularized design makes it easily extensible for researchers. Agents is available at https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近大型语言模型（LLMs）的高级进展使研究人员和开发人员能够构建自主语言代理，这些代理能够通过自然语言接口自动解决各种任务并与环境、人类和其他代理交互。我们将语言代理视为人工通用智能的有前途的方向，并发布Agents，一个开源库，旨在向更广泛的非专业人士开放这些进展。Agents经过精心设计，支持重要功能，包括规划、记忆、工具使用、多代理通信和细粒度的符号控制。Agents用户友好，使非专业人士能够在不需要编写太多代码的情况下构建、定制、测试、调优和部署最先进的自主语言代理。该库也对研究人员友好，其模块化设计使其易于扩展。",
