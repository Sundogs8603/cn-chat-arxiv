MAML and its variations have become popular techniques for quickly adapting to new tasks by leveraging previous learning knowledge in areas like regression, classification, and reinforcement learning. However, its theoretical guarantees remain unknown due to non-convexity and its structure, making it even more challenging to ensure stability in the dynamic system setting.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究的主要目标是探索在线性系统二次优化控制（LQR）中应用Model-agnostic Meta-learning（MAML）时的局部收敛特性。MAML及其变体已成为快速适应新任务的流行技术，通过利用在回归、分类和强化学习等领域的先前学习知识。然而，由于非凸性和其结构，MAML的理论保证仍然未知，这使得在动态系统设置中确保稳定性更具挑战性。本研究重点研究了MAML在LQR设置中的局部收敛性保证，同时保持动态系统的稳定性。该论文还提供了简单的数值结果，以展示MAML在LQR任务中的收敛性质。",
