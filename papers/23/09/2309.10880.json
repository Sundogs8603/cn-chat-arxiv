We have created NLP models that can automatically classify organizations with respect to categories associated with environmental issues as well as Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes, which are used by the U.S. government to characterize business activities. As input, the NLP models are provided with text snippets retrieved by the Google search engine for each organization, which serves as a textual description of the organization that is used for learning. Our experimental results show that NLP models can achieve reasonably good performance for these two classification tasks, and they rely on a general framework that could be applied to many other classification problems as well. We believe that NLP models represent a promising approach for automatically harvesting informatio",
