    "translated_abstract": "配额机制在代理面对多个决策且货币转移不可行时常被用于引出私人信息。当决策数量增加时，配额机制渐近地实施与使用转移的独立机制相同的社会选择函数集合。我们分析了配额机制的鲁棒性。为了设置正确的配额，设计者必须对环境有精确的了解。我们证明，没有转移的情况下，只有平凡的社会选择规则可以以先验独立的方式实施。当配额不匹配真实的类型分布时，我们得到了决策误差的紧密界限。最后，我们证明在多代理的环境中，配额对于代理对彼此的信念是鲁棒的。关键是，配额使得报告的分布成为共知。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the application of quota mechanisms when agents face multiple decisions and monetary transfers are infeasible. The research finds that as the number of decisions increases, quota mechanisms can implement the same set of social choice functions as separate mechanisms with transfers, and they are robust to agents' beliefs about each other. The study also reveals that precise knowledge of the environment is necessary for setting the correct quota, otherwise only trivial social choice rules can be implemented. Additionally, quotas make the distribution of reports common knowledge."
