    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型在图像合成方面取得了巨大成功，但在高分辨率生成方面仍面临挑战。通过离散余弦变换，我们发现主要原因在于“在高分辨率上相同的噪声水平会导致频域中较高的信噪比”。在这项工作中，我们提出了中继扩散模型（RDM），通过模糊扩散和块噪声将低分辨率的图像或噪声转化为等效的高分辨率图像，以供扩散模型使用。因此，扩散过程可以在任何新的分辨率或模型上无缝地继续进行，而无需从纯噪声或低分辨率条件重新开始。RDM在CelebA-HQ和ImageNet 256×256上都实现了最先进的FID和sFID，大大超过了之前的ADM、LDM和DiT等工作。所有的代码和检查点都以开源方式在https://github.com/THUDM/RelayDiffusion上公开。",
