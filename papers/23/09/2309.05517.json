    "translated_abstract": "主动学习（AL）通过智能选择要标记的实例，减少了训练机器学习模型所需的标记数据量。传统的基于池的AL要求所有数据都集中在数据中心，这在深度学习中需要越来越多的数据时可能会面临挑战。然而，在移动设备和机器人（如自动驾驶汽车）上进行感知传感器流的数据过滤后再到达数据中心是可行的。我们在这项工作中利用了这种图像流的时序特性，并提出了一种新的时序预测损失（TPL）方法。为了正确评估基于流的设置，我们引入了GTA V街道和A2D2街道数据集，并将其公开。我们的实验证明了我们的方法在提高选择的多样性方面显著优于基于不确定性的方法。由于基于池的方法在感知应用中更为常见，我们提出了一种比较基于池和基于流的AL的概念。",
