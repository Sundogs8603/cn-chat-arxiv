    "translated_abstract": "语义通信（SC）被期望成为一个新的范式转变，推动下一代通信的发展，其主要关注点从精确的比特传输转移到了在通信中进行有效的语义信息交换。然而，先前和广泛使用的图像评估度量标准不适用于评估SC中的图像语义相似性。用于衡量两个图像之间相似度的经典度量标准通常依赖于像素级或结构级，例如PSNR和MS-SSIM。在SC中直接使用基于深度学习方法的某些定制度量标准（如LPIPS）是不可行的。为了解决这个问题，受NLP领域的BERTScore的启发，我们提出了一种用于评估图像语义相似性的新度量标准，称为Vision Transformer Score（ViTScore）。我们从理论上证明了ViTScore具有对称性、有界性和归一化等三个重要属性，这使得ViTScore在图像衡量中方便和直观。",
