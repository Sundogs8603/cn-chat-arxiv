Based on a spatio-temporal vehicle interaction graph, an observed traffic scenario can be transformed into the graph spectral domain by means of the multidimensional Graph Fourier Transformation. Since these spectral scenario representations have shown to successfully incorporate the complex and interactive nature of traffic scenarios, the beneficial feature representation is employed for the purpose of predicting vehicle trajectories. This work introduces GFTNNv2, a deep learning network predicting vehicle trajectories in the graph spectral domain. Evaluation of the GFTNNv2 on the publicly available datasets highD and NGSIM shows a performance gain of up to 25% in comparison to state-of-the-art prediction approaches.",
