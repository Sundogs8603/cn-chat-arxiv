    "abstract": "This study presents FP-PET, a comprehensive approach to medical image segmentation with a focus on CT and PET images. Utilizing a dataset from the AutoPet2023 Challenge, the research employs a variety of machine learning models, including STUNet-large, SwinUNETR, and VNet, to achieve state-of-the-art segmentation performance. The paper introduces an aggregated score that combines multiple evaluation metrics such as Dice score, false positive volume (FPV), and false negative volume (FNV) to provide a holistic measure of model effectiveness. The study also discusses the computational challenges and solutions related to model training, which was conducted on high-performance GPUs. Preprocessing and postprocessing techniques, including gaussian weighting schemes and morphological operations, are explored to further refine the segmentation output. The research offers valuable insights into the challenges and solutions for advanced medical image segmentation.",
