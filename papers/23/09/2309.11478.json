    "abstract": "We address the integration of storytelling and Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop engaging and believable Social Chatbots (SCs) in community settings. Motivated by the potential of fictional characters to enhance social interactions, we introduce Storytelling Social Chatbots (SSCs) and the concept of story engineering to transform fictional game characters into \"live\" social entities within player communities. Our story engineering process includes three steps: (1) Character and story creation, defining the SC's personality and worldview, (2) Presenting Live Stories to the Community, allowing the SC to recount challenges and seek suggestions, and (3) Communication with community members, enabling interaction between the SC and users. We employed the LLM GPT-3 to drive our SSC prototypes, \"David\" and \"Catherine,\" and evaluated their performance in an online gaming community, \"DE (Alias),\" on Discord. Our mixed-method analysis, based on questionnaires (N=15) and interviews (N=8) wit",

    "translated_abstract": "我们探讨了故事和Large Language Models (LLMs)的整合，以在社区环境中开发引人入胜且可信的社交聊天机器人（SCs）。受到虚构角色增强社交互动潜力的启发，我们引入了故事聊天机器人（SSCs）和故事工程的概念，将虚构游戏角色转化为玩家社区中的“活体”社交实体。我们的故事工程过程包括三个步骤：（1）角色和故事创造，定义SC的个性和世界观，（2）向社区展示活体故事，让SC描述挑战并寻求建议，（3）与社区成员进行交流，实现SC与用户之间的互动。我们使用LLM GPT-3驱动我们的SSC原型“David”和“Catherine”，并在Discord的在线游戏社区“DE（Alias）”上评估了它们的表现。我们进行了基于问卷（N=15）和访谈（N=8）的混合方法分析。",
