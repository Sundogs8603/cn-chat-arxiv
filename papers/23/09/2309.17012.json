    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）通过简单的提示和上下文学习作为自动评估器非常有效。本研究组装了15个大小不同的LLMs，并通过其他LLMs的偏好排名来评估它们的输出响应，例如System Star比System Square更好。然后，我们引入了用于评估LLMs输出中六种不同认知偏差的认知偏差基准测试（CoBBLEr），如自我中心偏差，即模型更喜欢将自己的输出在评估中排名较高。我们发现LLMs是有偏见的文本质量评估器，在每个评估中都表现出对我们偏见基准的强烈迹象（在所有模型上的平均比较约为40%），这对它们作为评估器的鲁棒性提出了质疑。此外，我们还研究了人类和机器偏好之间的相关性，并计算了平均的Rank-Biased O值。",
