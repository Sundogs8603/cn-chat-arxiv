Traditional monitoring systems often struggle to handle complex, dynamic environments with fluctuating vital signs, leading to delays in identifying critical conditions.

Our approach deploys multiple learning agents, each dedicated to monitoring a specific physiological feature, such as heart rate, respiration, and temperature. These agents interact with a generic healthcare monitoring environment, learn the patients' behavior patterns, and make informed decisions to alert the corresponding Medical Emergency Teams (METs) based on the level of emergency estimated. In this study, we evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-agent DRL framework using real-world physiological and motion data from two datasets: PPG-DaLiA and WESAD. We compare the results ",
