    "translated_abstract": "尽管多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）被广泛用于各种视觉语言任务，但观察到它们有时会误解视觉输入，甚至在简单情况下未能遵循文本指令，导致无关的回复、错误和无根据的主张。我们将这一观察类比于神经心理学中的一种现象，即失识症，即无法正确处理感觉模态和认识事物（例如，对象、颜色、关系）。在我们的研究中，我们采用这一类似的概念来定义“MLLM中的失识症”，我们的目标是全面评估和缓解MLLM中的失识症。受到神经心理学中的诊断和治疗过程的启发，我们提出了一种新的框架EMMA（评估和缓解多模态失识症）。在EMMA中，我们开发了一个评估模块，用于自动创建细粒度和多样化的视觉问答示例，全面评估MLLM中的失识症程度。我们还提出了一种治疗模块，使用修正和增强的训练方法来减轻和纠正MLLM中的失识症。",
