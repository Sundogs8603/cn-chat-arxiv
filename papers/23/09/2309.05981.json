    "translated_abstract": "在理解社会群体中政治意识形态的动态和减轻其影响的措施方面，对在线新闻文章的政治倾向进行量化有助于。然而，使用机器学习模型准确预测新闻文章的政治倾向是一项具有挑战性的任务。这是因为(i)新闻文章的政治意识形态由多个因素定义，以及(ii)现有学习模型在模型训练过程中受新闻发布者的政治偏见的影响而偏倚。目前只有有限的方法来研究新闻文章的政治倾向，这些方法也没有考虑算法的政治偏见，这降低了机器学习模型对任何新闻发布者发布的新闻文章的政治倾向的泛化能力。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于知识的深度学习模型，利用相对可靠的外部数据资源来学习无偏见的新闻文章表示。",
