    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）系统，特别是生成式人工智能技术在我们的社会中变得越来越重要。像ChatGPT这样的工具被残障社群的成员使用，例如，自闭症患者可以使用它来帮助撰写电子邮件。生成式人工智能工具的不断增长的影响和受欢迎程度促使我们研究它们在残障社群中的相关性。设计和开发阶段通常忽视了这个边缘化群体，导致了针对他们的预测不准确和不公平的歧视。这可能是由于在创建和实施的各个阶段中的数据集、算法和系统中的偏见所导致。本研讨会论文提出了一个平台，以在构建生成式人工智能系统时让残障社群参与其中。通过这个平台，我们的目标是深入了解当残障社群使用生成式人工智能时，对其输出产生偏见的因素。此外，我们希望理解哪些算法因素是最具影响力的。",
