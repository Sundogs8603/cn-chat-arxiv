    "translated_abstract": "神经形态计算是目前少数具有潜力显著降低机器学习和人工智能功耗的方法之一。Imam＆Cleland提出了一种在神经形态架构上运行的嗅觉学习算法，该算法受到哺乳动物嗅觉球中描述的电路的启发。他们通过一组气体传感器记录对气味的不同呈现，并通过脉冲噪声对其进行扰动来评估算法在“快速在线学习和识别”气体气味和无气味气体（简称“气体”）方面的性能。我们重复了研究的部分，并发现了一些影响一些结论的限制。首先，使用的数据集存在传感器漂移和非随机测量协议，使其对气味识别基准测试的用处有限。其次，我们发现该模型在重复呈现相同气体时的泛化能力受限。我们证明了这个任务",
