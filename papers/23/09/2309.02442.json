Different sparse matrix formats are suitable for different structures of data. Therefore, the first challenge is identifying the matrix structure before the computation to match it with an appropriate data format. The second challenge is to avoid reading the entire dataset before classifying it. This can be done by identifying the matrix structure through samples and their features.

To address these challenges, we develop a framework that generates sparse matrix structure classifiers using graph convolutional networks.

    "translated_abstract": "稀疏矩阵计算的性能高度依赖于矩阵格式与要计算的数据的底层结构的匹配。不同的稀疏矩阵格式适用于不同的数据结构。因此，首要挑战是在计算之前识别矩阵结构，以将其与适当的数据格式相匹配。第二个挑战是避免在对数据进行分类之前读取整个数据集。这可以通过识别矩阵结构通过样本及其特征来实现。然而，全局特征可能无法从一个采样集中确定，而必须从局部特征中推断出来。为了应对这些挑战，我们开发了一个使用图卷积网络生成稀疏矩阵结构分类器的框架。该框架还可以通过用户提供的生成器扩展到其他矩阵结构。该方法在一组代表性稀疏矩阵上实现了97%的分类准确率。",
