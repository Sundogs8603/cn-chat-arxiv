    "translated_abstract": "导盲机器人是为导引视障人士而设计的非常有用的工具，鉴于真正导盲犬的可获得性低且高成本，其可能产生巨大的社会影响。尽管已经演示了几个导盲机器人系统，但没有考虑到导盲犬实际环境中经常发生的来自人类的外部拉扯。本文通过强化学习（RL）同时训练了一个对外部拉扯力具有鲁棒性的运动控制器和一个通过监督学习的外力估计器。控制器确保了稳定的行走，外力估计器使机器人能够对人类施加的外部力做出响应。这些力用于将机器人引导到未知的全局目标，同时机器人通过局部规划器将人类引导绕过附近的障碍物。在模拟和硬件上的实验结果表明，我们的控制器对外部力具有鲁棒性，并且我们的导盲系统能够准确检测...",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一种带有力响应式运动控制的导盲四足机器人导航系统，通过同时训练运动控制器和外力估计器，实现对外部拉扯力的稳健感知和响应。实验结果表明该系统能够准确导航并绕过障碍物，具有较强的鲁棒性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study presents a quadruped navigation system for guiding visually impaired people, incorporating force-responsive locomotion control. By training both a locomotion controller and an external force estimator, the system demonstrates robust perception and response to external tugging forces. Experimental results show accurate navigation and obstacle avoidance with high resilience."
