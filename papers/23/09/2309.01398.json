    "translated_abstract": "电子健康记录中包含大量有价值的信息，但很多记录都是自由文本。信息提取是将字符序列转换为结构化数据的策略，可以用于二次分析。然而，传统的信息提取组件，如命名实体识别和关系抽取，需要标注数据来优化模型参数，这已经成为构建信息提取系统的主要瓶颈之一。随着大型语言模型在各种下游自然语言处理任务中取得良好的性能而无需参数调优，使用大型语言模型进行零-shot信息提取也成为可能。在本研究中，我们旨在探索最流行的大型语言模型ChatGPT是否能从放射报告中提取有用信息。我们首先为CT报告中感兴趣的信息设计提示模板。然后，我们通过生成基于这些提示模板的提示语句到ChatGPT实现信息提取。",
