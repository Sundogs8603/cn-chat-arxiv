To contribute to these fields, we present SpeechAlign, a framework to evaluate the underexplored field of source-target alignment in speech models. Our framework has two core components. First, to tackle the absence of suitable evaluation datasets, we introduce the Speech Gold Alignment dataset, built upon a English-German text translation gold alignment dataset. Secondly, we introduce two novel metrics, Speech Alignment Error Rate (SAER) and Time-weighted Speech Alignment Error Rate (TW-SAER), to evaluate alignment quality in speech models. By publishing SpeechAlign we provide an accessible evaluation framework for model assessment, and we employ it to benchmark open-source Speech Translation models.",

    "translated_abstract": "语音到语音和语音到文本翻译目前是研究的动态领域。为了对这些领域做出贡献，我们提出了SpeechAlign，一种评估语音模型中源目标对齐这一未被充分研究的领域的框架。我们的框架有两个核心组成部分。首先，为了解决缺乏合适的评估数据集的问题，我们介绍了Speech Gold Alignment数据集，该数据集是在英德文本翻译的黄金对齐数据集基础上构建的。其次，我们引入了两个新的指标，语音对齐错误率（SAER）和时间加权语音对齐错误率（TW-SAER），用于评估语音模型中的对齐质量。通过发布SpeechAlign，我们提供了一个可访问的评估框架用于模型评估，并且我们使用它来对开源的语音翻译模型进行基准测试。",
