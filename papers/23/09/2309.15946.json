    "translated_abstract": "为了支持机器学习方法在预测时间序列数据方面的进展，我们提出了一个专门用于长期时序预测的综合数据集。我们采集了来自各种不同、动态系统和真实记录的数据集。每个数据集都经过标准化处理，分为训练和测试轨迹，并预先确定了回溯长度。我们包括了长度为2000的轨迹，以确保可靠地评估长期预测能力。为了确定在不同场景中最有效的模型，我们使用经典和最先进的模型（包括LSTM、DeepAR、NLinear、N-Hits、PatchTST和LatentODE）进行了广泛的基准分析。我们的研究结果显示了这些模型之间有趣的性能比较，突出了模型有效性与数据集相关性的特点。值得注意的是，我们引入了一种定制的潜在NLinear模型，并在DeepAR中增加了一个课程学习阶段。",
