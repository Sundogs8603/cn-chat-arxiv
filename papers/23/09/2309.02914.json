    "translated_abstract": "地理位置是人道主义应对的关键要素，描述了脆弱人口、正在发生的事件和可用资源。自然语言处理领域的最新进展可以帮助从人道部门产生的报告和文档的泛滥中提取重要信息。然而，现有的最先进的信息提取工具的性能和偏见是未知的。在这项工作中，我们开发了经过注释的资源，对流行的命名实体识别（NER）工具Spacy和roBERTa进行微调，以执行人道主义文本的地理标记。然后，我们提出了一个地理编码方法FeatureRank，将候选位置链接到GeoNames数据库。我们发现，人道主义领域的数据不仅改善了分类器的性能（F1 = 0.92），而且还减轻了现有工具的偏见，这些工具错误地偏向于西方国家的位置。因此，我们得出结论，需要更多来自非西方的资源。",

The results show improved classifier performance and reduced biases, highlighting the need for more non-Western resources in this field."
