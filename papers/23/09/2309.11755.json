    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于不同传感器（如LiDAR和摄像头）提供的互补信息，多模态模型受到关注。然而，这需要准确校准的配对数据以及模态之间复杂的校准，从而增加了高质量数据集的收集成本，并限制了其在实际场景中的应用。鉴于此前的工作，我们不仅解决了多模态信息融合的问题，还充分利用了RGB模态中的信息。我们引入了2D Detection Annotations Transmittable Aggregation（2DDATA），设计了一个数据特定的分支，称为Local Object Branch，旨在处理某个边界框内的点云，因为获取2D边界框注释相对容易。我们证明了我们的简单设计可以将边界框先验信息传输给3D编码器模型，从而验证了大型多模态模型融合的可行性。",
