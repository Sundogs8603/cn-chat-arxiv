    "translated_abstract": "阿片类药物是一种有效的急性和慢性疼痛止痛药，但也带来了相当大的成瘾风险，导致美国每年数百万阿片类药物使用障碍（OUD）病例和数万人的过早死亡。在处方之前估计OUD风险可以改进治疗方案的效果、监测计划和干预策略，但风险估计通常基于自我报告的数据或调查问卷。我们开发了实验设计和计算方法，将与OUD相关的遗传变异与从GPS和Wi-Fi时空坐标中提取的行为特征结合起来评估OUD风险。由于OUD迁移和遗传数据不存在于同一个群体中，我们开发了算法来(1)根据经验分布生成迁移特征和(2)合成迁移和遗传样本，假设存在某种共病和相对风险水平。我们展示了整合遗传和迁移模式可以改善风险估计的能力。",
