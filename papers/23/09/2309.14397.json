The study starts by looking at how lifestyle decisions, such as eating habits, exercise routines, and alcohol consumption, may affect hormonal imbalances and inflammation, two important factors driving the development of breast cancer. Additionally, it explores the part played by environmental contaminants such pesticides, endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), and industrial emissions, all of which have been linked to a higher risk of developing breast cancer due to their interference with hormone signaling and DNA damage.

    "translated_abstract": "乳腺癌逐渐成为造成女性死亡的主要因素，超过了心脏病。虽然遗传因素在乳腺癌的发展中很重要，但新的研究表明环境因素在其发生和发展中也起着重要作用。本研究报告对可能影响乳腺癌风险、发病率和结局的各种环境因素进行了全面的综述。研究从生活方式决策开始，如饮食习惯、运动习惯和饮酒，这些因素可能影响激素失衡和炎症，这是乳腺癌发展的两个重要因素。此外，本研究还探讨了农药、内分泌干扰物（EDCs）和工业废气等环境污染物在乳腺癌发展中扮演的角色，这些物质通过干扰激素信号传导和DNA损伤而与乳腺癌风险增加相关。机器学习算法可用于预测环境对乳腺癌的影响。",
