    "translated_abstract": "逆向合成是确定能够反应形成所需产物的一组反应物分子的过程。半模板化逆向合成方法首先预测产物中的反应中心，然后将生成的合成物重新补全成反应物。这些方法能够提供必要的可解释性和高实用性，以指导合成规划。我们开发了一种新的离线-在线强化学习方法RLSynC，用于半模板化方法中的合成物补全。RLSynC为每个合成物分配一个代理，所有代理都通过同步进行逐步行动，完成合成物的补全。RLSynC通过同时进行离线训练和在线交互来学习策略，从而可以探索新的反应空间。RLSynC使用正向合成模型来评估预测的反应物在合成产物时的可能性，从而指导行动搜索。",
