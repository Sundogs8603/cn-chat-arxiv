    "translated_abstract": "一个理想的数据选择算法可以高效地选择最具信息量的样本，以最大化有限的注释预算的效用。然而，目前的方法（例如主动学习方法）通常遵循一个繁琐的流程，反复进行耗时的模型训练和批量数据选择。在本文中，我们挑战了这种现状，通过设计一个独特的数据选择流程，利用现有的通用模型，在单次推理中选择来自不同数据集的数据，而无需额外的训练或监督。我们提出了一种新的自由数据选择（FreeSel）方法来实现这个新的流程。具体地，我们定义了从通用模型的中间特征中提取的语义模式，以捕捉每个图像中微妙的局部信息。然后，我们通过基于距离的采样在细粒度的语义模式级别上实现了对所有数据样本的选择。FreeSel绕过了原来的耗时训练和批量数据选择的流程。",
