Despite achieving promising outcomes, most of these methods are still struggling to ensure that the graphs generated from the latent space are acyclic by minimizing a defined score. There has also been another trend of permutation-based approaches, which concern the search for the topological ordering of the variables in the directed acyclic graph (DAG) in order to limit the search space of the graph. In this study, we propose an alternative approach for strictly constraining the acyclicty of the graphs with an integration of the knowledge from the topological orderings.

    "translated_abstract": "基于得分的结构学习方法因其可扩展性而蓬勃发展。连续松弛是这一进展的关键原因。尽管取得了有希望的结果，但大多数方法仍然在通过最小化定义的得分来确保从潜在空间生成的图是无环的方面遇到困难。还存在另一种基于置换的方法，关注的是有向无环图（DAG）中变量的拓扑排序的搜索，以限制图的搜索空间。在本研究中，我们提出了一种利用拓扑排序知识来严格限制图的无环性的替代方法。我们的方法可以减少推理复杂性，同时确保生成的图的结构是无环的。我们对模拟和真实数据进行的实证实验表明，我们的方法可以胜过相关的贝叶斯基于得分的方法。",
