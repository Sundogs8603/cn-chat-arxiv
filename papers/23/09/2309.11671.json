    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the effect of popularity degradation bias in the context of local music recommendations. Specifically, we examine how accurate two top-performing recommendation algorithms, Weight Relevance Matrix Factorization (WRMF) and Multinomial Variational Autoencoder (Mult-VAE), are at recommending artists as a function of artist popularity. We find that both algorithms improve recommendation performance for more popular artists and, as such, exhibit popularity degradation bias. While both algorithms produce a similar level of performance for more popular artists, Mult-VAE shows better relative performance for less popular artists. This suggests that this algorithm should be preferred for local (long-tail) music artist recommendation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了流行度衰减偏差对本地音乐推荐的影响。具体来说，我们检验了两种最佳推荐算法，即权重相关矩阵分解（WRMF）和多项式变分自动编码器（Mult-VAE）在推荐艺术家时的准确性与艺术家流行度的关系。我们发现，这两个算法在推荐流行艺术家方面具有更好的性能，因此表现出流行度衰减偏差。虽然这两个算法在推荐流行艺术家方面的表现水平相似，但对于不太流行的艺术家来说，Mult-VAE相对表现更好。这表明在本地（长尾）音乐艺术家推荐中，应该优先选择这个算法。",
