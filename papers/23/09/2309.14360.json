    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型在应用于新的应用场景时，受限的可迁移性影响其性能。最近，无监督域适应（UDA）通过学习领域不变特征在解决这个问题上取得了显著进展。然而，现有的UDA方法的性能受到大范围的领域偏移和有限的目标域数据的限制。为了缓解这些问题，我们提出了一种领域引导条件扩散模型（DACDM），用于为目标域生成高保真度和多样性的样本。在所提出的DACDM中，通过引入类别信息，可以控制生成样本的标签，并且在DACDM中还引入了一个领域分类器来指导目标域的生成样本。生成的样本帮助现有的UDA方法更轻松地从源域转移到目标域，从而提高了迁移性能。在各种基准测试上进行的大量实验表明，DACDM带来了较大的改进。",
