    "translated_abstract": "控制屏障函数（CBFs）在设计安全控制器中吸引了广泛的关注，以在实际的安全关键系统中部署。然而，周围环境的感知通常受到随机性的影响，并可能进一步偏离名义值。在本文中，我们提出了分布鲁棒CBF（DR-CBF），以实现在分布偏移下的韧性，并保持CBF的优势，如计算效率和正向不变性。为了实现这个目标，我们首先提出了一个单层凸重组，用于估计分布偏移下用Wasserstein度量衡量的安全约束的条件风险（CVaR），这本质上是三层规划。另外，为了构建控制屏障条件以强制实现CVaR的正向不变性，我们应用了可微凸规划技术，以实现CVaR估计的优化层内的微分。",
