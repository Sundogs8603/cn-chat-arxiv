    "translated_abstract": "格陵兰岛的射电中微子观测站(RNO-G)是一种用于探测超高能中微子的射电天线阵列，位于格陵兰峰站。目前仍在建设中，目前已有7个观测站运作。中微子探测通过测量由中微子与核子相互作用产生的阿斯卡林辐射来实现。中微子候选事件必须从其他背景中找到，这些背景的记录率要高得多，包括宇宙射线和人为噪声等，有时其来源是未知的。这里，我们描述了一种利用变分自编码器的潜空间来对不同噪声类别进行分类的方法。潜空间形成了一种紧凑的表示，使得分类变得可行。我们分析了一个有噪声和一个静默观测站的数据。该方法能够自动检测并允许我们定性地区分多个事件类别，包括风引起的物理信号，同时适用于有噪声和静默观测站。",
