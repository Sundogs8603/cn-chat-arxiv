Our objective is to minimize the expected AoI across devices by optimizing UAVs' stopping locations and device selection probabilities. To tackle this problem, we first derive a closed-form expression of the expected AoI that involves the probabilities of selection of devices. Then, we formulate the problem as a non-convex minimization subject to quality of service constraints. Since the problem is challenging to solve, we propose an Ensemble Deep Neural Network (EDNN) based approach which takes advantage of the dual formulation of the studied problem. Specifically, the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the ensemble are trained in an unsupervised manner using the Lagrangian function of the studied problem. Our experiments show that the proposed EDNN method outperforms traditional DNNs in reducing the expected AoI, achieving a remarkable reduction of $29.5\\%$.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对无人机辅助网络中时延信息（AoI）的问题进行了研究。我们的目标是通过优化无人机的停留位置和设备选择概率来最小化设备之间的预期AoI。为了解决这个问题，我们首先推导出了一个包含设备选择概率的预期AoI的闭式表达式。然后，我们将问题形式化为一个非凸最小化问题，并添加了服务质量约束。由于这个问题很难解决，我们提出了一种基于集成深度神经网络（EDNN）的方法，该方法利用了所研究问题的对偶形式。具体而言，集成中的深度神经网络（DNNs）通过使用所研究问题的Lagrangian函数以无监督的方式进行训练。我们的实验结果表明，所提出的EDNN方法在减少预期AoI方面表现优于传统的DNNs，实现了显著的29.5%降低。",
