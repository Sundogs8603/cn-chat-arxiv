    "translated_abstract": "在精确测量边界上研究潜在的超出标准模型效应，需要将低能量测量的信息准确传递给高能量的超出标准模型。我们提出使用归一化流构建实现这种传递的似然函数。以这种方式构建的似然函数能够生成额外的样本，并允许使用\"平凡\"的拟合优度检验，即卡方检验统计量。在这里，我们研究了一种特定形式的归一化流，将其应用于多模态和非高斯的例子，并量化了似然函数及其拟合优度检验统计量的准确性。",

These likelihood functions facilitate additional sample generation and provide a \"trivial\" goodness-of-fit test in the form of a chi-square test statistic. The paper applies this approach to a multi-modal and non-Gaussian example and quantifies the accuracy of the likelihood function and its test statistic."
