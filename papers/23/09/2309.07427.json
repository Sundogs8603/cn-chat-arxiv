    "abstract": "Determining an individual's strategic reasoning capability based solely on choice data is a complex task. This complexity arises because sophisticated players might have non-equilibrium beliefs about others, leading to non-equilibrium actions. In our study, we pair human participants with computer players known to be fully rational. This use of robot players allows us to disentangle limited reasoning capacity from belief formation and social biases. Our results show that, when paired with robots, subjects consistently demonstrate higher levels of rationality and maintain stable rationality levels across different games compared to when paired with humans. This suggests that strategic reasoning might indeed be a consistent trait in individuals. Furthermore, the identified rationality limits could serve as a measure for evaluating an individual's strategic capacity when their beliefs about others are adequately controlled.",

    "translated_abstract": "仅基于选择数据确定个体的战略推理能力是一项复杂的任务。这种复杂性源于复杂的玩家可能对其他人有非均衡的信念，导致非均衡的行为。在我们的研究中，我们将人类参与者与已知完全理性的计算机玩家配对。通过使用机器人玩家，我们能够将有限的推理能力与信念形成和社会偏差相区分开来。我们的研究结果表明，当与机器人配对时，被试表现出始终较高的理性水平，并在不同游戏中保持稳定的理性水平，相比之下与人类配对时则不然。这表明战略推理可能的确是个体的一种一贯特征。此外，确定的理性限制可以作为评估个体对他人信念适当控制时的战略能力的指标。",
