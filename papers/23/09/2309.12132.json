    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）的出现为自动化建筑合同管理提供了前所未有的机会，减少了人为错误，并节省了大量时间和成本。然而，由于缺乏领域专业知识，LLMs可能会产生令人信服但不准确和误导性的内容。为了解决这个问题，专家驱动的合同知识可以以结构化的方式表示，以约束自动化合同管理过程。本文介绍了嵌套合同知识图（NCKG），一种使用嵌套结构来捕捉合同知识复杂性的知识表示方法。它包括一个嵌套知识表示框架、一个建立在该框架上的NCKG本体以及一种实现方法。此外，我们提出了在NCKG中增强外部知识的LLM辅助合同审查流程。我们的流程在合同风险审查方面取得了良好的性能，为LLM和KG的结合提供了启示。",
