    "translated_abstract": "数据是深度学习的基石。本文揭示了最近开发的Diffusion模型是一个用于目标检测的可扩展数据引擎。现有的缩放检测导向数据的方法通常需要手动收集或生成模型来获取目标图像，然后进行数据增强和标注产生训练对，这些方法成本高、复杂或缺乏多样性。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了DiffusionEngine（DE），这是一个数据扩展引擎，以单一阶段提供高质量的检测导向训练对。DE由一个预训练的扩散模型和一个有效的检测适配器组成，为生成可扩展、多样化和可泛化的检测数据做出了贡献，并支持即插即用。检测适配器通过学习将现成的扩散模型中的隐式语义和位置知识与检测相关的信号进行对齐，从而产生更好的边界框预测。此外，我们还贡献了两个数据集，即COCO-DE和...",
