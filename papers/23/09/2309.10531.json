    "abstract": "A huge amount of information is produced in digital form. The Semantic Web stems from the realisation that dealing efficiently with this production requires getting better at interlinking digital informational resources together. Its focus is on linking data. Linking data isn't enough. We need to provide infrastructural support for linking all sorts of informational resources including resources whose understanding and fine interlinking requires domain-specific human expertise. At times when many problems scale to planetary dimensions, it is essential to scale coordination of information processing and information production, without giving up on expertise and depth of analysis, nor forcing languages and formalisms onto thinkers, decision-makers and innovators that are only suitable to some forms of intelligence. This article makes a proposal in this direction and in line with the idea of interlinking championed by the Semantic Web.",

    "translated_abstract": "数量庞大的信息以数字形式产生。语义Web的出现是因为我们意识到，要有效处理这些信息的产生，需要更好地将数字信息资源相互连接。它的重点是连接数据。但仅仅连接数据是不够的。我们需要为连接各种信息资源提供基础设施支持，包括那些理解和精细连接需要特定领域人类专业知识的资源。在很多问题规模达到全球水平的时候，提升信息处理和信息产生的协作能力至关重要，但同时也不能放弃专业知识和深度分析，也不能把只适用于某些智能形式的语言和形式主义强加给思考者、决策者和创新者。本文提出了一个与语义Web推崇的相互连接的思想一致的方向上的提案。",
