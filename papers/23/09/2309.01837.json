    "abstract": "Motivated by the emergence of decentralized machine learning ecosystems, we study the delegation of data collection. Taking the field of contract theory as our starting point, we design optimal and near-optimal contracts that deal with two fundamental machine learning challenges: lack of certainty in the assessment of model quality and lack of knowledge regarding the optimal performance of any model. We show that lack of certainty can be dealt with via simple linear contracts that achieve 1-1/e fraction of the first-best utility, even if the principal has a small test set. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions on the size of the principal's test set that achieves a vanishing additive approximation to the optimal utility. To address the lack of a priori knowledge regarding the optimal performance, we give a convex program that can adaptively and efficiently compute the optimal contract.",

    "translated_abstract": "受分散机器学习生态系统的出现的启发，我们研究了数据收集的委托问题。以契约理论为出发点，我们设计了解决两个基本机器学习挑战的最优和近似最优契约：模型质量评估的不确定性和对任何模型最优性能的缺乏知识。我们证明，通过简单的线性契约可以解决不确定性问题，即使委托人只有一个小的测试集，也能实现1-1/e的一等效用水平。此外，我们给出了委托人测试集大小的充分条件，可以达到对最优效用的逼近。为了解决对最优性能缺乏预先知识的问题，我们提出了一个凸问题，可以自适应和高效地计算最优契约。",
