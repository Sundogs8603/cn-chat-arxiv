    "translated_abstract": "社会护理应用的提供对于改善老年人的生活质量和为运营商提供早期干预是至关重要的。在健康老龄应用中准确预测用户退学是必要的，因为它们直接与个体健康状况相关。机器学习算法已经实现了高度准确的预测，超越了传统统计方法，在处理个体模式时非常困难。然而，机器学习需要大量的数据进行训练，这在存在个人可识别信息(PII)和受到法规碎片化的情况下具有挑战性。本文提出了一种联邦机器学习(FML)方法，该方法最大程度地减少了隐私问题，并实现了分布式训练，而不需要传输个体数据。我们通过考虑FML下的个体和组织来进行协作训练，这样可以对跨设备和跨平台学习场景进行建模。",
