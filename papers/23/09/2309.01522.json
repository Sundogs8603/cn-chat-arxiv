    "abstract": "The recently released artificial intelligence conversational agent, ChatGPT, has gained significant attention in academia and real life. A multitude of early ChatGPT users eagerly explore its capabilities and share their opinions on it via social media. Both user queries and social media posts express public concerns regarding this advanced dialogue system. To mine public concerns about ChatGPT, a novel Self-Supervised neural Topic Model (SSTM), which formalizes topic modeling as a representation learning procedure, is proposed in this paper. Extensive experiments have been conducted on Twitter posts about ChatGPT and queries asked by ChatGPT users.

    "translated_abstract": "最近发布的人工智能对话代理ChatGPT在学术界和现实生活中引起了极大关注。许多早期的ChatGPT用户热切地探索其能力，并通过社交媒体分享他们对它的意见。用户查询和社交媒体帖子都表达了对这个先进对话系统的公众关切。为了挖掘关于ChatGPT的公众关切，本文提出了一种新颖的自监督神经主题模型（SSTM），该模型将主题建模形式化为一种表示学习过程。通过对关于ChatGPT的Twitter帖子和ChatGPT用户的查询进行广泛实验，实验结果表明，所提出的方法能够提取具有更高质量、更好的可解释性和多样性的公众关切，超过了最先进方法的性能。",
