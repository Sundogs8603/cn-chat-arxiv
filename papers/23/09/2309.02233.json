    "abstract": "arXiv:2309.02233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Large-scale language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive abilities in generating responses based on human instructions. However, their use in the medical field can be challenging due to their lack of specific, in-depth knowledge. In this study, we present a system called LLMs Augmented with Medical Textbooks (LLM-AMT) designed to enhance the proficiency of LLMs in specialized domains. LLM-AMT integrates authoritative medical textbooks into the LLMs' framework using plug-and-play modules. These modules include a Query Augmenter, a Hybrid Textbook Retriever, and a Knowledge Self-Refiner. Together, they incorporate authoritative medical knowledge. Additionally, an LLM Reader aids in contextual understanding. Our experimental results on three medical QA tasks demonstrate that LLMAMT significantly improves response quality, with accuracy gains ranging from 11.6% to 16.6%. Notably, with GPT-4-Turbo as the base mod",

    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT已经展示出根据人类指令生成响应的印象能力。然而，由于它们缺乏特定、深入的知识，它们在医学领域的应用可能具有挑战性。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种名为LLMs增强医学教科书（LLM-AMT）的系统，旨在增强LLMs在专业领域的能力。LLM-AMT通过插入式模块将权威医学教科书集成到LLMs的框架中。这些模块包括一个查询增强器、一个混合教科书检索器和一个知识自我完善。它们共同整合权威医学知识。此外，一个LLMs阅读器有助于上下文理解。我们在三个医学问答任务上的实验结果表明，LLMAMT显著提高了响应质量，准确率提高了11.6%到16.6%。值得注意的是，以GPT-4-Turbo为基础模型",
