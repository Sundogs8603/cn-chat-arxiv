    "translated_abstract": "本文提出PhantomSound，一种针对语音助手的查询高效黑盒攻击。现有的语音助手黑盒对抗攻击方法要么采用替换模型，要么利用中间模型输出来估计用于制作对抗性音频样本的梯度。然而，这些攻击方法需要大量的查询和冗长的训练阶段。PhantomSound利用基于决策的攻击来生成有效的对抗性音频，并通过优化梯度估计来减少查询数量。在实验中，我们针对4种不同的语音转文字API，在3种现实场景下进行攻击，以展示实时攻击的影响。结果显示，PhantomSound在攻击5种流行的商用语音可控设备方面具有实用性和鲁棒性，并且能够以超过95%的成功率绕过3种活体检测机制。基准结果显示，PhantomSound可以生成对抗性音频。",
