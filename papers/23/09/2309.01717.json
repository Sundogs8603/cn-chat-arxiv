    "translated_abstract": "研究提案主题推理的目标是从资助机构定义的学科体系中获取最合适的学科划分，然后机构将根据这种划分从其数据库中找到合适的同行评审专家。自动化的主题推理可以减少人工主题填写引起的错误，弥补资助机构和项目申请人之间的知识差距，提高系统效率。现有方法将其建模为层次性多标签分类问题，使用生成模型迭代地推理最合适的主题信息。然而，这些方法忽视了跨学科研究提案和非跨学科研究提案之间规模差异，导致自动推理系统将跨学科提案归类为非跨学科，造成在专家分配过程中的不公平现象。我们如何解决这个数据不平衡的问题呢？",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种基于层次变换器的方法，通过选择性插值来解决在跨学科研究提案和非跨学科研究提案之间规模差异引起的不公平现象。"
