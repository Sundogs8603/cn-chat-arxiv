    "abstract": "Rule learning approaches for knowledge graph completion are efficient, interpretable and competitive to purely neural models. The rule aggregation problem is concerned with finding one plausibility score for a candidate fact which was simultaneously predicted by multiple rules. Although the problem is ubiquitous, as data-driven rule learning can result in noisy and large rulesets, it is underrepresented in the literature and its theoretical foundations have not been studied before in this context. In this work, we demonstrate that existing aggregation approaches can be expressed as marginal inference operations over the predicting rules. In particular, we show that the common Max-aggregation strategy, which scores candidates based on the rule with the highest confidence, has a probabilistic interpretation. Finally, we propose an efficient and overlooked baseline which combines the previous strategies and is competitive to computationally more expensive approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱补全的规则学习方法高效、可解释性强，与纯神经模型具有竞争力。规则聚合问题涉及如何为同时被多个规则预测的候选事实找到一个合理性得分。尽管这个问题非常普遍，但由于数据驱动的规则学习可能导致噪声和庞大的规则集，因此该问题在文献中占比较少，其理论基础尚未在此背景下进行研究。在这项工作中，我们证明了现有的聚合方法可以表达为对预测规则的边际推断操作。特别地，我们展示了常见的最大聚合策略，即根据置信度最高的规则为候选事实评分，具有概率解释。最后，我们提出了一个高效且被忽视的基准方法，结合了之前的策略，并能与计算代价更高的方法竞争。",
