The main obstacle to automation lies in the difficulty of developing a reliable robotic grasping system for already harvested trusses. We propose a method to grasp trusses that are stacked in a crate with considerable clutter, which is how they are commonly stored and transported after harvest. The method consists of a deep learning-based vision system to first identify the individual trusses in the crate and then determine a suitable grasping location on the stem. To this end, we have introduced a grasp pose ranking algorithm with online learning capabilities. After selecting the most promising grasp pose, the robot executes a pinch grasp without needing touch sensors or geometric models. Lab experiments with a robotic manipulator equipped with an eye-in-hand RGB-D camera showed a 100% clearance rate when tasked to pick all trusses from a pile. 93% of the trusses were successfully grasped on the first try,",

    "translated_abstract": "目前，对于西红柿的称重和包装需要大量的人工操作。自动化的主要障碍在于开发一个可靠的用于已采摘的穗果的机器人抓取系统的困难。我们提出了一种方法来抓取堆放在装箱中的穗果，这是它们在采摘后常见的存储和运输方式。该方法包括一个基于深度学习的视觉系统，首先识别出装箱中的单个穗果，然后确定茎部的适合抓取的位置。为此，我们引入了一个具有在线学习能力的抓取姿势排序算法。在选择了最有前景的抓取姿势之后，机器人执行一种无需触觉传感器或几何模型的夹持抓取。实验室实验证明，配备了一个手眼一体的RGB-D相机的机器人操纵器从堆中捡起所有的穗果的清理率达到100%。93%的穗果在第一次尝试时成功抓取。",
