    "translated_abstract": "将原生AI支持集成到网络架构中是6G的一个重要目标。联邦学习（FL）作为一种潜在的范式出现，可以在中央服务器的协调下，促进分散的AI模型训练跨越多种设备。然而，在6G环境下，有几个挑战阻碍了其广泛应用，例如恶意攻击和对本地模型更新的隐私监视，以及集中化的缺点。本研究提出了一种支持FL的可信架构，该架构利用分布式分类账技术（DLT）和图神经网络（GNN），包括三个关键特性。首先，引入同态加密的预处理层用于安全地聚合本地模型，保护个体模型的隐私。其次，考虑到预处理层中客户端和节点之间的分布式性质和图结构，利用GNN来识别异常本地模型，增强系统安全性。第三，利用DLT来维护网络中节点之间的信任关系，并提供安全的共识机制。",
