    "abstract": "We present a novel human body model formulated by an extensive set of anthropocentric measurements, which is capable of generating a wide range of human body shapes and poses. The proposed model enables direct modeling of specific human identities through a deep generative architecture, which can produce humans in any arbitrary pose. It is the first of its kind to have been trained end-to-end using only synthetically generated data, which not only provides highly accurate human mesh representations but also allows for precise anthropometry of the body. Moreover, using a highly diverse animation library, we articulated our synthetic humans' body and hands to maximize the diversity of the learnable priors for model training. Our model was trained on a dataset of $100k$ procedurally-generated posed human meshes and their corresponding anthropometric measurements. Our synthetic data generator can be used to generate millions of unique human identities and poses for non-commercial academic ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于广泛的人体比例测量而构建的新颖人体模型，能够生成各种不同形状和姿势的人体。所提出的模型通过深度生成架构，实现了对特定人物身份的直接建模，并能够以任意姿势生成人体。这是第一种通过仅使用合成数据进行端到端训练的模型，不仅提供了高精度的人体网格表示，还允许对人体进行精确的人体比例测量。此外，通过使用高度多样化的动画库，我们为合成人体的身体和手部进行了关节处理，以最大程度地提高模型训练中可学习先验的多样性。我们的模型在一个包含10万个程序生成的人体网格和相应人体比例测量的数据集上进行了训练。我们的合成数据生成器可以用于生成非商业学术用途下的数百万个独特人物身份和姿势。",
