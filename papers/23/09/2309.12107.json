    "abstract": "WikiHow is an open-domain repository of instructional articles for a variety of tasks, which can be revised by users. In this paper, we extract pairwise versions of an instruction before and after a revision was made. Starting from a noisy dataset of revision histories, we specifically extract and analyze edits that involve cases of vagueness in instructions. We further investigate the ability of a neural model to distinguish between two versions of an instruction in our data by adopting a pairwise ranking task from previous work and showing improvements over existing baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "WikiHow是一个开放领域的教学文章库，用于各种任务，用户可以对其进行修订。本文从修订历史的噪声数据集中提取了一对一的版本，即修订之前和修订之后的指令。我们特别提取并分析涉及指令模糊性的编辑。通过采用之前工作中的一种成对排名任务，并展示对现有基线的改进，进一步研究了神经模型在我们的数据中区分两个版本的指令的能力。",
