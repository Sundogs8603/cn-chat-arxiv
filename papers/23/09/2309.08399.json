    "translated_abstract": "工业机器人被设计为通用硬件，这限制了它们适应任务需求或环境变化的能力。而模块化机器人则提供了灵活性，可以轻松定制以适应不同的需求。机器人的形态，即机器人的形式和结构，对主要性能指标--采购成本、周期时间和能源效率有着重要影响。然而，针对特定任务的最佳模块组合仍然是一个尚未解决的问题，在开发任务定制的模块化机器人中面临重大障碍。以往的方法要么无法充分探索设计空间，要么无法适应复杂任务。我们提出了将遗传算法与词典式评估解决方案候选的组合，以克服这个问题，并在可能组合的数量上比先前的工作范围更大的搜索空间中进行导航。我们证明了我们的方法优于最先进的技术。",
