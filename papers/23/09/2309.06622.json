    "translated_abstract": "Schr\\\"{o}dinger桥是一个随机最优控制问题，目的是在控制扩散和截止约束条件下将给定的初始状态密度转变为另一个状态密度。在经典和线性系统设置中，解决Schr\\\"{o}dinger桥问题的一种常用方法是通过收缩不动点递归进行数值计算。这些递归可以看作是著名的Sinkhorn迭代的动态版本，在温和的假设下，它们解决了所谓的具有线性收敛性的Schr\\\"{o}dinger系统。在这项工作中，我们研究了与Schr\\\"{o}dinger系统的收敛性相关的收缩系数的先验估计。我们提供了收缩系数的新几何和控制理论解释。基于这些新发现的解释，我们指出通过预条件化终点支持集可以改善线性SBPs的最坏情况收缩系数的计算。",
