    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统在改善用户在线体验的同时，也引发了对潜在的提供商公平性问题的关注。这些系统可能会不经意地偏爱热门物品，从而使较不流行的物品边缘化，并妥协了提供商的公平性。虽然以前的研究已经意识到提供商公平性问题，但对这些偏见如何影响推荐系统的超越准确性方面（如多样性、新颖性、覆盖率和偶然性）的调查却不够重视。在本文中，我们通过引入一个简单而有效的后处理重新排序模型，旨在优先考虑提供商公平性的同时，保持用户相关性和推荐质量，来填补这一空白。然后，我们对模型在多个数据集上对推荐质量的各个方面的影响进行深入评估。具体而言，我们将后处理算法应用于四个不同领域数据集上的四个独立的推荐模型，进行评估。",
