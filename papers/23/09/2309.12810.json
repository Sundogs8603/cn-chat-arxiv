    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在提供一个关于开源多语言工具StyloMetrix的概述。它提供了覆盖语法、句法和词汇等各个方面的文体文本表示。StyloMetrix覆盖了四种语言：波兰语作为主要语言，英语、乌克兰语和俄语。每个特征的归一化输出可以成为机器学习模型的有益来源，并对任何深度学习算法的嵌入层起到有价值的补充。我们旨在提供对StyloMetrix向量应用的简明但详尽的概述，以及对开发的语言特征集的解释。实验结果表明，在简单算法（如随机森林分类器、投票分类器、逻辑回归等）的监督内容分类中，取得了有希望的结果。深度学习评估揭示了StyloMetrix向量在增强从Transformer架构中提取的嵌入层方面的有用性。",
