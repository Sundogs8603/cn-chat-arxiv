    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习（SSL）取得了显著的成功，其中对比学习（CL）起到了关键作用。然而，最近发展起来的新的非CL框架已经取得了可比甚至更好的性能，并且有很大的改进潜力，这促使研究人员进一步提升这些框架。将CL融入非CL框架被认为是有益的，但经验证据表明没有明显的改进。基于此，本文提出了一种在维度方向上执行CL而不是以传统的批次方向进行对比学习的策略，命名为Dimensional Contrastive Learning（DimCL）。DimCL旨在增强特征的多样性，并且可以作为先前的SSL框架的正则化器。结果发现DimCL是有效的，并且硬样本对其成功起到了关键作用。广泛的实验结果表明将DimCL融入SSL框架可以提高性能。",
