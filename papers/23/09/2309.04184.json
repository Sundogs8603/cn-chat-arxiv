    "abstract": "This article analyzes the reception of a novel algorithmic recommendation of documentary films by a panel of moviegoers of the T{\\\"e}nk platform. In order to propose an alternative to recommendations based on a thematic classification, the director or the production period, a set of metadata has been elaborated within the framework of this experimentation in order to characterize the great variety of ``documentary filmmaking dispositifs'' . The goal is to investigate the different ways in which the platform's film lovers appropriate a personalized recommendation of 4 documentaries with similar or similar filmmaking dispositifs. To conclude, the contributions and limits of this proof of concept are discussed in order to sketch out avenues of reflection for improving the instrumented mediation of documentary films.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了T{\\\"e}nk平台电影观众对纪录片的新颖算法推荐的接受情况。为了提出一种替代基于主题分类、导演或制作时期的推荐方法，在这个实验框架内，我们构建了一组元数据，以描述“纪录片制作设备”的丰富多样性。研究的目标是调查平台的电影爱好者在个性化推荐的情况下如何理解和接受有相似纪录片制作设备的4部纪录片。最后，讨论了这个概念验证的贡献和局限，以勾勒出提升纪录片仪器化媒介的思考方向。",
