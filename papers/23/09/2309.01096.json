    "translated_abstract": "在机制设计理论中，代理人的类型被描述为他们的私人信息，设计者可以揭示一些公共信息以影响代理人的类型，从而获得更多的回报。传统上，每个代理人的私人类型和公共信息分别被表示为随机变量。本文提出了一种类型可调节机制，其中每个代理人的私人类型被表示为两个参数的函数，即他的内在因素和外部控制因素。每个代理人的内在因素被建模为私人随机变量，而外部控制因素被建模为设计者优化问题的解。类型可调节机制的优点是，通过选择控制因素的最优值作为公共信息，设计者可以获得对她自己和所有代理人都有利的帕累托最优结果。相比之下，在具有相互依赖值的拍卖中，公共信息的使用限制了最优结果的实现。",
