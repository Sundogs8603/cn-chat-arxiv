    "translated_abstract": "演化性预测是一个最近提出的框架，其中预测指导决策并因此影响未来的数据分布。这样的演化现象在交通、金融、公共政策和推荐系统等各个领域中普遍存在。到目前为止，关于演化性预测的工作只关注无约束情况，忽视了许多实际学习问题受限制的事实。本文通过研究不平等约束下的演化性预测来填补这一空白。与大多数现有工作只提供演化稳定点不同，我们的目标是找到最优解。预测性梯度的预测是一项具有挑战性的任务，这是由于对数据分布的演化性的无知所致。为了解决这个问题，我们首先开发了一个稳健的原始-对偶框架，它只需要近似梯度达到一定的精度，但提供与随机原始-对偶算法相同数量级的性能。",
