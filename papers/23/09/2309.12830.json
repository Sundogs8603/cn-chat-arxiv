    "translated_abstract": "AI和基于机器学习的处理在各个应用领域的使用日益增加，加剧了对低成本机器学习实现的需求，特别是对资源受限的嵌入式系统而言。为此，近似计算作为一种探索功耗、性能、面积（PPA）和行为准确性（BEHAV）之间权衡的方法，已经成为在嵌入式机器学习中实现的可能解决方案之一。在机器学习中，由于MAC操作的占主导地位，设计特定于平台的近似算术运算符形成了近似计算中的主要研究问题之一。最近，越来越多的基于AI/ML的设计空间探索技术被用于实现近似运算符。然而，大多数这些方法仅限于使用基于机器学习的代理函数来预测一组相关设计决策的PPA和BEHAV影响。尽管这种方法利用了机器学习方法的回归能力，但没有充分利用更先进的方法。",
