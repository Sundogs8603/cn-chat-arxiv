    "translated_abstract": "机器人导航的学习是一项关键且具有挑战性的任务。真实世界数据集的稀缺性和昂贵性需要高效的学习方法。在本文中，我们利用二维导航规划中的欧几里得对称性，该对称性源于参考框架之间的欧几里得变换，并实现参数共享。为了解决非结构化环境的挑战，我们将导航问题规划为在几何图上的规划，并开发了一种等变消息传递网络来执行价值迭代。此外，为了处理多摄像头输入，我们提出了一个可学习的等变层将特征提升到所需空间。我们在包括结构化和非结构化环境、已知和未知地图以及给定点目标或语义目标的五个不同任务上进行了全面评估。我们的实验结果证实了训练效率、稳定性和泛化性能的显著优势。",
