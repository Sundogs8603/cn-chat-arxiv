    "abstract": "What makes waveform-based deep learning so hard? Despite numerous attempts at training convolutional neural networks (convnets) for filterbank design, they often fail to outperform hand-crafted baselines. This is all the more surprising because these baselines are linear time-invariant systems: as such, their transfer functions could be accurately represented by a convnet with a large receptive field. In this article, we elaborate on the statistical properties of simple convnets from the mathematical perspective of random convolutional operators. We find that FIR filterbanks with random Gaussian weights are ill-conditioned for large filters and locally periodic input signals, which both are typical in audio signal processing applications. Furthermore, we observe that expected energy preservation of a random filterbank is not sufficient for numerical stability and derive theoretical bounds for its expected frame bounds.",

    "translated_abstract": "波形为基础的深度学习为什么如此困难？尽管有多次尝试训练卷积神经网络(convnets)进行滤波器设计，但它们往往无法超越手工创建的基线。这更令人惊讶，因为这些基线是线性时不变系统：因此，它们的传递函数可以通过具有大感受野的卷积神经网络准确表示。在本文中，我们从随机卷积算子的数学角度详细阐述了简单卷积神经网络的统计属性。我们发现，具有随机高斯权重的FIR滤波器组在大滤波器和局部周期输入信号的情况下是病态的，这在音频信号处理应用中是典型的。此外，我们观察到随机滤波器组的期望能量保持对于数值稳定性是不足够的，并推导了其期望帧边界的理论界限。",
