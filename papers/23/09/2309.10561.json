    "abstract": "Introduction: Covert tobacco advertisements often raise regulatory measures. This paper presents that artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, has great potential for detecting hidden advertising and allows unbiased, reproducible, and fair quantification of tobacco-related media content. Methods: We propose an integrated text and image processing model based on deep learning, generative methods, and human reinforcement, which can detect smoking cases in both textual and visual formats, even with little available training data. Results: Our model can achieve 74\\% accuracy for images and 98\\% for text. Furthermore, our system integrates the possibility of expert intervention in the form of human reinforcement. Conclusions: Using the pre-trained multimodal, image, and text processing models available through deep learning makes it possible to detect smoking in different media even with few training data.",

    "translated_abstract": "引言：隐蔽的烟草广告常常引起监管措施。本文提出，人工智能尤其是深度学习在检测隐藏广告中具有巨大潜力，并可以对烟草相关媒体内容进行无偏见、可重复性和公正的量化。方法：我们提出了一种基于深度学习、生成方法和人工强化的综合文本和图像处理模型，可以在文本和视觉格式下检测吸烟案例，即使有很少的可用训练数据。结果：我们的模型在图像上可以达到74%的准确率，在文本上可以达到98%的准确率。此外，我们的系统还集成了专家干预的可能性，以人工强化的形式。结论：使用深度学习提供的预训练多模态、图像和文本处理模型，即使有少量的训练数据，也可以检测出不同媒体中的吸烟行为。",
