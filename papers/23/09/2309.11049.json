    "translated_abstract": "近年来，表格数据上的问答（TableQA）已经引起了越来越多的关注。现有的工作倾向于从一个或几个表格单元中提取信息，生成事实性的简短答案，而缺乏对选定表格单元进行推理的能力。然而，自由形式的TableQA需要更复杂的相关表格单元选择策略和独立信息的复杂集成和推理，这方面的研究还不充分。为此，本文提出了一个广义的三阶段方法：表格到图的转换和单元定位、外部知识检索和表格-文本融合（称为TAG-QA），以解决生成式TableQA中针对长自由形式答案的推理挑战。具体而言，TAG-QA (1) 使用图神经网络定位相关表格单元，以收集相关行和列之间的交叉单元；(2) 利用维基百科的外部知识；(3)...",
