    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于单图像的无监督方法，用于联合分割和去噪。为此，我们将变分分割方法的优势与自监督、基于单图像的深度学习方法的能力结合起来。我们方法的一个主要优点在于，与需要大量标记样本的数据驱动方法不同，我们的模型可以在没有任何训练数据库的情况下将图像分割成多个有意义的区域。此外，我们引入了一种新颖的能量函数，其中去噪和分割以一种相互受益的方式耦合在一起。通过与自监督图像去噪的特定组合，我们解决了现有的单图像基于变分分割方法对高噪声或通用纹理的限制。我们提出了一个统一的优化策略，并展示了在显微镜中可用的非常嘈杂的图像上，我们的方法表现出色。",
