    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶系统需要实时环境感知以确保用户安全和体验。流式感知是报告世界当前状态的任务，用于评估自动驾驶系统的延迟和准确性。在实际应用中，硬件限制和高温等因素不可避免地导致自动驾驶系统的延迟，从而导致模型输出与世界状态之间的偏差。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了多时间步检测器（MTD），它是一个端到端的检测器，使用动态路由进行多分支未来预测，使模型具有抵抗延迟波动的能力。提出了一个延迟分析模块（DAM），优化现有的延迟感知方法，不断监测模型推断堆栈并计算延迟趋势。此外，构建了一个新颖的时间步骤分支模块（TBM），包括静态流和自适应流，以自适应地预测未来时间步。",
