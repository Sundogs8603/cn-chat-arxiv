    "abstract": "The study of biological materials and bio-inspired materials science is well established; however, surprisingly little knowledge has been systematically translated to engineering solutions. To accelerate discovery and guide insights, an open-source autoregressive transformer large language model, BioinspiredLLM, is reported.

The model has proven by example that it is not only able to accurately recall information about biological materials when queried but also formulate biomaterials questions and answers that can evaluate its own performance. BioinspiredLLM also has been shown to develop sound hypotheses regarding biological materials design and remarkably so for materials that have never been explicitly ",
