    "translated_abstract": "生成人工智能模型的不可思议能力不可避免地导致了它们在药物发现领域的应用。因此，开发能够增强这些强大工具的能力和适用性的方法论具有巨大的兴趣。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖而高效的半监督主动学习方法，该方法通过在构建的样本空间表示中策略性地操作，可以使生成模型相对于客观函数进行微调。在目标分子生成的背景下，我们展示了一种能够相对于基于吸引力相互作用评分函数进行微调的GPT基础分子生成模型的能力，通过在化学空间代理内部策略性地操作，从而最大化生成的分子与蛋白质靶标之间的吸引力相互作用。重要的是，我们的方法不需要对用于微调的所有数据点进行单独的评估。",
