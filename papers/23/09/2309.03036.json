    "translated_abstract": "部分伪造音频检测是一项具有挑战性的任务，需要在帧级别准确地定位音频的真实性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种精细化的部分伪造音频检测方法，即临时Deepfake位置（TDL），可以有效地捕捉特征和位置信息。具体而言，我们的方法包括两个新颖的部分：嵌入相似性模块和时间卷积操作。为了增强真实特征和伪造特征之间的区分度，嵌入相似性模块被设计用于生成一个嵌入空间，可以将真实帧与伪造帧分离开来。为了有效地关注位置信息，我们提出了时间卷积操作，用于计算相邻帧之间的特定帧相似性，并动态选择信息丰富的邻居进行卷积。广泛的实验表明，我们的方法在ASVspoof2019 Partial Spoof数据集中优于基准模型。",
