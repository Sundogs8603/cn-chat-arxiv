    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in multivariate time series has received extensive study due to the wide spectrum of applications. An anomaly in multivariate time series usually indicates a critical event, such as a system fault or an external attack. Therefore, besides being effective in anomaly detection, recommending anomaly mitigation actions is also important in practice yet under-investigated. In this work, we focus on algorithmic recourse in time series anomaly detection, which is to recommend fixing actions on abnormal time series with a minimum cost so that domain experts can understand how to fix the abnormal behavior. To this end, we propose an algorithmic recourse framework, called RecAD, which can recommend recourse actions to flip the abnormal time steps. Experiments on two synthetic and one real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our framework.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于广泛的应用领域，多变量时间序列的异常检测已经受到广泛研究。多变量时间序列中的异常通常表示临界事件，例如系统故障或外部攻击。因此，除了在异常检测方面有效之外，推荐异常缓解行动在实践中也很重要但研究不足。在这项工作中，我们专注于时间序列异常检测中的算法补救方法，即推荐以最小成本修复异常时间序列，以便领域专家可以理解如何修复异常行为。为此，我们提出了一种算法补救框架，称为RecAD，可以推荐翻转异常时间步骤的补救行动。对两个合成数据集和一个真实数据集的实验结果显示了我们框架的有效性。",
