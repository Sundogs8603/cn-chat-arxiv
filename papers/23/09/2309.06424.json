    "translated_abstract": "语义和跨语言代码克隆生成对于代码重用、代码理解、重构和基准测试可能非常有用。OpenAI的GPT模型在这种克隆生成方面有潜力，因为GPT被用于文本生成。当开发人员从Stack Overflow（SO）或系统内部复制/粘贴代码时，可能会出现不一致的更改导致意外行为。同样，如果某人拥有一种编程语言中的代码片段，但在不同的语言中寻找等效功能，则语义跨语言代码克隆生成方法可能会提供有价值的帮助。 在这项研究中，我们使用SemanticCloneBench作为工具，评估了GPT-3模型在生成给定代码片段的语义和跨语言克隆变体方面的表现。我们收集了一组多样化的代码片段，并评估了GPT-3在生成代码变体方面的性能。通过广泛的实验和分析，我们通过9位法官花费了158个小时进行验证。",
