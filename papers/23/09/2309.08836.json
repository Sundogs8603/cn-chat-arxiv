    "abstract": "Chatbots have been studied for more than half a century. With the rapid development of natural language processing (NLP) technologies in recent years, chatbots using large language models (LLMs) have received much attention nowadays. Compared with traditional ones, modern chatbots are more powerful and have been used in real-world applications. There are however, bias and fairness concerns in modern chatbot design. Due to the huge amounts of training data, extremely large model sizes, and lack of interpretability, bias mitigation and fairness preservation of modern chatbots are challenging. Thus, a comprehensive overview on bias and fairness in chatbot systems is given in this paper. The history of chatbots and their categories are first reviewed. Then, bias sources and potential harms in applications are analyzed. Considerations in designing fair and unbiased chatbot systems are examined. Finally, future research directions are discussed.",

    "translated_abstract": "聊天机器人已经研究了半个多世纪。随着近年来自然语言处理技术的快速发展，使用大型语言模型的聊天机器人现在备受关注。与传统的聊天机器人相比，现代聊天机器人更强大，并已在实际应用中使用。然而，在现代聊天机器人设计中存在偏见和公平性问题。由于训练数据量巨大、模型规模庞大且缺乏可解释性，现代聊天机器人的偏见缓解和公平保护具有挑战性。因此，本文对聊天机器人系统中的偏见和公平性进行了全面概述。首先回顾了聊天机器人的历史和类别。然后，分析了应用中的偏见来源和潜在危害。研究了设计公平和无偏的聊天机器人系统的考虑因素。最后，讨论了未来的研究方向。",
