    "abstract": "Open vocabulary keyword spotting is a crucial and challenging task in automatic speech recognition (ASR) that focuses on detecting user-defined keywords within a spoken utterance. Keyword spotting methods commonly map the audio utterance and keyword into a joint embedding space to obtain some affinity score. In this work, we propose AdaKWS, a novel method for keyword spotting in which a text encoder is trained to output keyword-conditioned normalization parameters. These parameters are used to process the auditory input. We provide an extensive evaluation using challenging and diverse multi-lingual benchmarks and show significant improvements over recent keyword spotting and ASR baselines. Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of our approach on low-resource languages that were unseen during the training. The results demonstrate a substantial performance improvement compared to baseline methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "开放词汇关键词检测是自动语音识别（ASR）中的关键和具有挑战性的任务，其重点是识别口语中用户定义的关键词。关键词检测方法通常将音频和关键词映射到一个联合嵌入空间中，以获得一些相关性得分。在本文中，我们提出了AdaKWS，一种新方法用于关键词检测，在这种方法中，训练一个文本编码器以输出关键词条件归一化参数。这些参数用于处理听觉输入。我们使用具有挑战性和多样化的多语言基准进行了全面的评估，并显示出与最近的关键词检测和ASR基准相比的显着改进。此外，我们研究了我们的方法在训练过程中未见的低资源语言上的有效性。结果表明与基准方法相比存在显着的性能改进。",
