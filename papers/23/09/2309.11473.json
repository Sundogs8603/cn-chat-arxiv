    "translated_abstract": "无监督多视图表示学习已经广泛应用于挖掘多视图数据。然而，仍然存在一些关键的挑战。一方面，现有方法不能全面地探索多视图数据，因为它们通常在视图之间学习一个公共的表示，而多视图数据既包含视图之间的公共信息，又包含每个视图内的特定信息。另一方面，为了挖掘数据之间的非线性关系，常常使用核方法或神经网络方法进行多视图表示学习。然而，这些方法在解释性方面存在不足。因此，本文提出了一种基于可解释的Takagi-Sugeno-Kang（TSK）模糊系统的新的多视图模糊表示学习方法（MVRL_FS）。该方法从两个方面实现了多视图表示学习。首先，将多视图数据转化为高维模糊特征空间，同时保留视图之间的通用信息；",
