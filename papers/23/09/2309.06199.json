    "translated_abstract": "在计算机视觉、机器人和自动驾驶等领域，使用LiDAR点云进行3D目标检测是一项基础任务。然而，现有的3D检测器严重依赖于注释数据集，这在标记3D边界框的过程中既耗时又容易出错。本文提出一种场景完整性预训练（SCP）方法，以增强使用较少标记数据的3D目标检测器的性能。SCP具有三个关键优势：（1）改善点云模型的初始化。通过完善场景点云，SCP有效捕捉城市环境中物体间的空间和语义关系。（2）消除对额外数据集的需求。SCP作为有价值的辅助网络，不会对3D检测器施加任何额外的工作或数据要求。（3）减少目标检测所需的标记数据量。借助SCP的帮助，现有的最先进3D检测器可以实现与大量标记数据相当的性能。",
