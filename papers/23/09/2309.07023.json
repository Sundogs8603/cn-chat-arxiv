    "translated_abstract": "粗糙Heston模型是近年来在数学金融领域非常流行的模型；然而，其缺乏Markov性和半鞅特性在理论和实践中都带来了重大挑战。解决这个问题的一种方法是使用该模型的Markov逼近。几项先前研究表明，即使附加因素的数量非常低，这些逼近方法也能非常精确。现有的误差分析主要基于强误差，对应于核函数之间的$L^2$距离。在[Abi Jaber和El Euch, SIAM Journal on Financial Mathematics 10(2):309--349, 2019]的早期结果的基础上，我们展示了对于欧式期权的一般类别的支付函数，Markov逼近的弱误差可以通过核逼近的$L^1$误差进行界定。此外，我们给出了收敛速度超多项式的特定Markov逼近，并展示了它们在运算上的数值优势。",
