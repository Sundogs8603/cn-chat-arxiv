    "translated_abstract": "阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（OSA）是一种影响全球约十亿人口的常见睡眠障碍。目前诊断OSA的黄金标准是多导睡眠图（PSG），它需要在医院过夜并连接多个传感器，从而可能因首夜效应而导致不准确。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为SlAction的非干扰性OSA检测系统，可以在日常睡眠环境中使用红外视频。由于睡眠视频中展现出的运动极少，本研究探究了一个基本问题：“在睡眠期间，呼吸事件是否适当地反映在人体运动中？”通过分析最大的睡眠视频数据集（总计5098小时），我们建立了OSA事件与睡眠期间人体运动之间的相关性。我们的方法使用了低帧率（2.5 FPS）、大尺寸（60秒）和滑动窗口分析的步长（30秒），以捕捉与OSA相关的缓慢和长期运动。此外，我们还利用了一个轻量级深度神经网络进行呼吸事件的分类。",
