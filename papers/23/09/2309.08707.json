    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了由Chiang, Hansen和Sasaki (2022)提出的一种对面板数据中具有相关共同时间效应的双向聚类依赖的方差估计方法。首先，我们通过代数方法证明了该方差估计方法（以下简称CHS估计器）是三种常见方差估计方法的线性组合：Arellano (1987)的聚类估计器、Driscoll和Kraay (1998)的“平均的HAC”估计器，以及Newey和West (1987)、Vogelsang (2012)的“HAC的平均”估计器。基于这一发现，我们得到了CHS估计器及其对应的检验统计量的固定b渐近结果，即在横截面和时间样本容量共同趋向无穷大时的结果。当带宽与时间样本容量之比趋向于零时，固定b渐近结果与Chiang等人(2022)的渐近正态结果相吻合。此外，我们提出了两种替代性的偏差校正方差估计器，并推导出相应的固定b渐近限制。",
