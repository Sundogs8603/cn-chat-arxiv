    "title": "\"With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!\": Student and Instructor Perspectives on the influence of LLMs on Undergraduate Engineering Education. (arXiv:2309.10694v2 [cs.HC] UPDATED)",
    "abstract": "The rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has prompted discussions in academic circles, with students exploring LLM-based tools for coursework inquiries and instructors exploring them for teaching and research. Even though a lot of work is underway to create LLM-based tools tailored for students and instructors, there is a lack of comprehensive user studies that capture the perspectives of students and instructors regarding LLMs. This paper addresses this gap by conducting surveys and interviews within undergraduate engineering universities in India. Using 1306 survey responses among students, 112 student interviews, and 27 instructor interviews around the academic usage of ChatGPT (a popular LLM), this paper offers insights into the current usage patterns, perceived benefits, threats, and challenges, as well as recommendations for enhancing the adoption of LLMs among students and instructors. These insights are further utilized to discuss the practical implications of LLM",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的流行引发了学术界的讨论，学生们探索了基于LLMs的课程查询工具，教师们则探索了基于LLMs的教学和研究。尽管正在努力开发专为学生和教师定制的LLMs工具，但缺乏全面的用户研究来捕捉学生和教师对LLMs的观点。本文通过在印度的本科工程院校进行调查和访谈，来填补这一空白。本文使用了1306份学生调查回答、112份学生访谈和27份教师访谈，探讨了ChatGPT（一种流行的LLM）在学术上的使用情况、感知到的好处、威胁和挑战，并提出了增强学生和教师采用LLMs的建议。这些洞见进一步用于讨论LLMs的实际影响。",
