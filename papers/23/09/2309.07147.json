    "translated_abstract": "听觉注意力检测 (AAD) 旨在从多说话者环境中的脑信号中检测目标说话者。尽管基于 EEG 的 AAD 方法近年来取得了令人期待的结果，但目前的方法主要依赖于为处理像图像这样的欧几里得数据设计的传统卷积神经网络。这使得处理具有非欧几里得特征的 EEG 信号变得具有挑战性。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种用于 AAD 的动态图自蒸馏 (DGSD) 方法，其不需要语音刺激作为输入。具体来说，为了有效表示 EEG 信号的非欧几里得特性，应用动态图卷积网络来表示 EEG 信号的图结构，该网络还可以提取与听觉空间注意力相关的关键特征。此外，为了进一步提高 AAD 检测性能，进行了自蒸馏，包括特征蒸馏和分层蒸馏。",
