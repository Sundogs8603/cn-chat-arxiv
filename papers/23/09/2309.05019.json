    "translated_abstract": "扩散概率模型在生成任务中取得了相当大的成功。由于从扩散概率模型中进行采样相当于解扩散随机微分方程或常微分方程，这是一项耗时的工作，因此提出了许多基于改进的微分方程求解器的快速采样方法。这些技术中的大部分方法都考虑解扩散常微分方程，因为它具有更好的效率。然而，随机采样可以在生成多样化和高质量数据方面提供额外的优势。在这项工作中，我们从两个方面进行了对随机采样的综合分析：方差控制的扩散随机微分方程和线性多步扩散随机微分方程求解器。基于我们的分析，我们提出了SA-Solver，它是一种改进的高效随机亚当方法，用于解扩散随机微分方程以生成高质量的数据。我们的实验结果显示，SA-Solver实现了：1）在少步采样中与现有最先进的采样方法相比，有改进或可比性能；2）SOTA FID分数。",
