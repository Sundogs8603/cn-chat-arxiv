    "translated_abstract": "自主用户界面（UI）机器人旨在通过与用户界面进行交互，实现任务自动化，无需手动干预。最近的研究探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）的能力，以在多样环境中有效参与。为了符合LLM的输入-输出要求，现有方法在沙盒环境中开发，依赖于外部工具和应用程序特定的API将环境解析为文本元素，并解释预测的动作。因此，这些方法常常受到推理效率低和错误传播风险的困扰。为了缓解这些挑战，我们引入了Auto-UI，一种多模态解决方案，它直接与界面交互，避免了对环境解析或依赖于应用程序相关的API的需求。此外，我们提出了一种动作链技术，利用一系列中间先前动作历史和未来动作计划，以帮助模型进行决策。",
