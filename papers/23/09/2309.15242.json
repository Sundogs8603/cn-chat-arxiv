    "translated_abstract": "游戏世界构建是开发游戏的叙事和物理世界的过程，在游戏体验中起着至关重要的作用。备受好评的独立游戏和AAA级视频游戏被赞赏其优秀的世界构建，其中游戏地图与叙事紧密融合并提升了游戏体验，吸引了玩家并留下了深刻的印象。然而，设计支持所期望叙事的游戏地图是具有挑战性的，因为它需要满足各种考虑因素的复杂约束。大多数现有的地图生成方法侧重于游戏机制或地图地形的考虑，而忽视了支持故事的需求。因此，仍然需要进行大量手动调整才能设计出适应特定故事的游戏世界。在这项工作中，我们通过在游戏世界构建流程中引入一个与底层地图生成方法无关的故事情节布局设计额外层面来解决这个问题。",
