    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)的出现提升了各种自然语言处理任务的性能和可能性。尽管像ChatGPT这样的生成型AI模型为一些商业用例开启了新的机会，但其当前倾向于产生虚假内容的特点严重限制了其在文档分析(如从文档中检索信息)方面的适用性。相反，像问题回答(QA)或段落检索模型这样的抽取型语言模型保证查询结果在相应上下文文档的边界内，使其成为公司生产环境中更可靠的信息提取候选模型。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种方法，使用和整合抽取型QA模型来改进对德语商业文档(如保险报告或药品说明书)的特征提取，形成一个文档分析解决方案。我们还展示了细调现有德语QA模型可以提升针对定制化信息提取的性能。",
