    "abstract": "Reliance on scanned documents and fax communication for healthcare referrals leads to high administrative costs and errors that may affect patient care. In this work we propose a hybrid model leveraging LayoutLMv3 along with domain-specific rules to identify key patient, physician, and exam-related entities in faxed referral documents. We explore some of the challenges in applying a document understanding model to referrals, which have formats varying by medical practice, and evaluate model performance using MUC-5 metrics to obtain appropriate metrics for the practical use case. Our analysis shows the addition of domain-specific rules to the transformer model yields greatly increased precision and F1 scores, suggesting a hybrid model trained on a curated dataset can increase efficiency in referral management.",
