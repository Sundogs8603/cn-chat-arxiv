We introduce VideolandGPT, a recommender system for a Video-on-Demand (VOD) platform, Videoland, which uses ChatGPT to select from a predetermined set of contents, considering the additional context indicated by users' interactions with a chat interface. We evaluate ranking metrics, user experience, and fairness of recommendations, comparing a personalised and a non-personalised version of the system, in a between-subject user study.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了如何通过大语言模型（LLMs）增强推荐系统，重点关注利用用户偏好和现有排名模型的个性化候选选择的会话式推荐系统。我们介绍了VideolandGPT，这是一个用于视频点播平台Videoland的推荐系统，它使用ChatGPT从预定内容集合中进行选择，考虑到用户与聊天界面的交互所示的额外上下文。我们通过一项用户研究，比较了个性化和非个性化版本的系统在排名指标、用户体验和推荐的公平性方面的表现。我们的结果表明，个性化版本在准确性和一般用户满意度方面优于非个性化版本，而两个版本都增加了排名推荐列表中非前列的项目的可见性。然而，在公平性方面，两个版本的行为都不一致。",
