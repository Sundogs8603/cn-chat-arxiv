    "translated_abstract": "过去的文献中提出了许多泛化界限作为解释神经网络在过参数化情况下泛化能力的潜在方法。然而，这些界限都不是紧致的。例如，在他们的论文“Fantastic Generalization Measures and Where to Find Them”中，Jiang等人（2020）检查了十几个泛化界限，并通过实验证明没有一个能够解释神经网络卓越的性能。这引出了一个问题，即是否有可能找到紧致的泛化界限。我们考虑了文献中常见的两种泛化界限：（1）依赖于训练集和学习算法输出的界限。文献中有多个这种类型的界限（例如基于范数和基于间隔的界限），但我们证明在过参数化的情况下，没有这样的界限能够一致地紧致；（2）依赖于训练集和测试集的界限。",
