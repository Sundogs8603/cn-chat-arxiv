    "translated_abstract": "对医疗时间序列的预测对于早期检测不良结果和患者监测至关重要。然而，由于数据嘈杂和间歇性，实际中预测可能很困难。这些挑战通常通过外部因素诱导的变化点（如药物使用）而加剧。我们提出了一种新颖的编码器，以向深度学习模型提供药物的药动学效应信息，从而实现对受治疗影响的时间序列的准确预测。我们展示了我们方法在使用逼真模拟和真实世界数据预测血糖的任务中的有效性。我们的药动学编码器使深度学习模型在模拟数据上超过基准约11％，在真实世界数据上超过8％。所提出的方法可以在临床实践中具有多种有益应用，例如发出关于意外治疗反应的早期警告，或帮助表征特定于患者的治疗效果。",
