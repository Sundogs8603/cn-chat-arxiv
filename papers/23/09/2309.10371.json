    "abstract": "A moderately detailed consideration of interactive LLMs as cognitive systems is given, focusing on LLMs circa mid-2023 such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, Bard, Llama, etc.. Cognitive strengths of these systems are reviewed, and then careful attention is paid to the substantial differences between the sort of cognitive system these LLMs are, and the sort of cognitive systems human beings are. It is found that many of the practical weaknesses of these AI systems can be tied specifically to lacks in the basic cognitive architectures according to which these systems are built. It is argued that incremental improvement of such LLMs is not a viable approach to working toward human-level AGI, in practical terms given realizable amounts of compute resources. This does not imply there is nothing to learn about human-level AGI from studying and experimenting with LLMs, nor that LLMs cannot form significant parts of human-level AGI architectures that also incorporate other ideas.

    "translated_abstract": "本文对互动LLMs作为认知系统进行了适度详细的考察，重点关注于2023年左右的LLMs，如ChatGPT、GPT-4、Bard、Llama等。回顾了这些系统的认知优势，然后仔细研究了这些LLMs与人类认知系统之间的实质性差异。研究发现，这些AI系统的许多实际弱点可以具体归因于这些系统构建所依赖的基本认知架构的缺陷。论文认为，在可实现的计算资源数量范围内，逐步改进此类LLMs并不是朝着达到人类级AGI的可行方法。这并不意味着在研究和实验LLMs方面不能从中获得关于人类级AGI的经验，也不意味着LLMs不能成为包含其他想法的人类级AGI架构的重要组成部分。社会和伦理问题。",
    "tldr": "本文考察了生成式AI（LLMs）作为认知系统的优势与劣势。研究发现，这些系统的实际弱点可以追溯到其基本认知架构的缺陷。逐步改进LLMs并不能实现人类水平的AGI。然而，研究和实验LLMs仍然有助于理解人类级AGI，并且LLMs可以成为人类级AGI架构的重要组成部分。"
