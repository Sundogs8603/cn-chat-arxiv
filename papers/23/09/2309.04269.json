    "abstract": "Selecting the ``right'' amount of information to include in a summary is a difficult task. A good summary should be detailed and entity-centric without being overly dense and hard to follow. To better understand this tradeoff, we solicit increasingly dense GPT-4 summaries with what we refer to as a ``Chain of Density'' (CoD) prompt. Specifically, GPT-4 generates an initial entity-sparse summary before iteratively incorporating missing salient entities without increasing the length. Summaries generated by CoD are more abstractive, exhibit more fusion, and have less of a lead bias than GPT-4 summaries generated by a vanilla prompt. We conduct a human preference study on 100 CNN DailyMail articles and find that that humans prefer GPT-4 summaries that are more dense than those generated by a vanilla prompt and almost as dense as human written summaries. Qualitative analysis supports the notion that there exists a tradeoff between informativeness and readability. 500 annotated CoD summaries",

    "translated_abstract": "选择在摘要中包含的“正确”信息量是一项困难的任务。一个好的摘要应该是详细和以实体为中心的，同时又不过于密集和难以理解。为了更好地理解这种权衡，我们使用了一种称为“密度链”（CoD）提示的方式，来产生越来越稠密的GPT-4摘要。具体而言，GPT-4首先生成一个初始的实体稀疏摘要，然后逐步加入缺失的突出实体，而不增加长度。 CoD生成的摘要更为概括，展示了更多的融合，并且比使用普通提示生成的GPT-4摘要具有更少的引导偏见。我们在100篇CNN DailyMail文章上进行了一个人类偏好研究，发现人们更喜欢比普通提示生成的GPT-4摘要更稠密，几乎与人工撰写的摘要一样密集。定性分析支持了信息量和可读性之间存在权衡的观点。",
