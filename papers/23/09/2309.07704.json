    "translated_abstract": "准确的饮食摄入估计对于支持健康饮食的政策和程序至关重要，因为营养不良与生活质量下降直接相关。然而，诸如食物日记之类的自我报告方法存在显著偏差。其他传统的饮食评估技术和新兴的替代方法，如移动应用程序，耗时长，并且可能需要受过训练的人员。最近的研究集中于使用计算机视觉和机器学习来从食物图像中自动估计饮食摄入量，但缺乏具有多样视角、模态和食物注释的综合数据集限制了这种方法的准确性和真实性。为了解决这个局限性，我们引入了NutritionVerse-Synth，这是第一个拥有84,984个逼真的合成2D食物图像及相关饮食信息和多模态标注的大规模数据集（包括深度图像、实例掩膜和语义掩膜）。",
