    "abstract": "The term \"generative AI\" refers to computational techniques that are capable of generating seemingly new, meaningful content such as text, images, or audio from training data. The widespread diffusion of this technology with examples such as Dall-E 2, GPT-4, and Copilot is currently revolutionizing the way we work and communicate with each other. In this article, we provide a conceptualization of generative AI as an entity in socio-technical systems and provide examples of models, systems, and applications. Based on that, we introduce limitations of current generative AI and provide an agenda for Business & Information Systems Engineering (BISE) research. Different from previous works, we focus on generative AI in the context of information systems, and, to this end, we discuss several opportunities and challenges that are unique to the BISE community and make suggestions for impactful directions for BISE research.",

    "translated_abstract": "\"生成型人工智能\"一词指的是能够从训练数据中生成看似新颖有意义的内容，如文本、图像或音频的计算技术。这种技术的广泛应用，例如Dall-E 2，GPT-4和Copilot，正在彻底改变我们工作和与他人交流的方式。在本文中，我们将生成型人工智能形容为社会技术系统中的一种实体，并提供了模型、系统和应用的示例。基于此，我们介绍了当前生成型人工智能的限制，并提出了对商业与信息系统工程（BISE）研究的议程。与以往的研究不同，我们重点讨论了信息系统背景下的生成型人工智能，并在此基础上讨论了BISE社区独特的机遇和挑战，并提出了对BISE研究的有影响的方向的建议。",
