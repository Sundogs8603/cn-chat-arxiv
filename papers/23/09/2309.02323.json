Marine species are shifting their distribution because of climate change towards colder waters, potentially compromising the benefits of currently established Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).

We chose the case studies to focus on large scale MPAs in i) a cold, polar region, ii) a tropical region near the equator, and iii) a tropical region farther from the equator. We quantify the biological impacts of shifts in species distribution due to climate change for fishing communities that depend on the Palau National Marine Sanctuary, the Great Barrier Reef Marine National Park Zone, and the North Bering Sea Research Area MPAs.

    "translated_abstract": "气候变化对生态系统产生了重大影响。由于气候变化，海洋物种正在向更冷的水域迁移，可能会对目前已建立的海洋保护区(MPAs)的利益造成威胁。因此，我们展示了三个案例研究区域将如何受到海洋温暖的影响，以帮助利益相关者了解MPAs周围渔业的变化趋势。我们选择了冷极地区、赤道附近的热带地区和赤道以外的热带地区作为案例研究重点。我们量化了由于气候变化而导致的物种分布变化对依赖帕劳国家海洋保护区、大堡礁海洋国家公园区和北白令海研究区MPAs的渔业社区的生物影响。我们发现，不同地区的渔业部门将受到不同的影响，并展示了这三个地区都可以通过采取适当措施来减弱这些影响。",

By quantifying the biological impacts of shifts in species distribution on fishing communities, it is found that the fisheries sectors in different regions will be affected differently, and appropriate measures are proposed to mitigate these impacts."
