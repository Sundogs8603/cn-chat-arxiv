    "abstract": "This article summarizes a systematic review of the electroencephalography (EEG)-based cognitive workload (CWL) estimation. The focus of the article is twofold: identify the disparate experimental paradigms used for reliably eliciting discreet and quantifiable levels of cognitive load and the specific nature and representational structure of the commonly used input formulations in deep neural networks (DNNs) used for signal classification. The analysis revealed a number of studies using EEG signals in its native representation of a two-dimensional matrix for offline classification of CWL. However, only a few studies adopted an online or pseudo-online classification strategy for real-time CWL estimation. Further, only a couple of interpretable DNNs and a single generative model were employed for cognitive load detection till date during this review. More often than not, researchers were using DNNs as black-box type models. In conclusion, DNNs prove to be valuable tools for classifying EE",

    "translated_abstract": "本文对基于脑电图(EEG)的认知负荷(CWL)估计进行了系统综述。文章的重点有两个方面：识别用于可靠地引发离散和可量化的认知负荷水平的不同实验范式，以及用于信号分类的深度神经网络(DNN)中常用输入形式的特定性质和表征结构。分析揭示了许多研究使用原生表示的EEG信号的二维矩阵进行离线CW检测。然而，只有少数研究采用了用于实时CWL估计的在线或伪在线分类策略。此外，在这份综述中，只有几个可解释的DNN和一个生成模型被用于认知负荷检测。总的来说，DNN证明是用于分类EEG信号的有价值的工具。",
