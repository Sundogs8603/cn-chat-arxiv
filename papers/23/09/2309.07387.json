    "translated_abstract": "视觉导向对话系统将多种沟通模式（如文本和视觉输入）集成在一起，成为一个越来越受关注的领域。然而，缺乏标准化的评估框架对于评估该领域的发展构成了挑战。为此，我们提出了VDialogUE，一个用于视觉导向对话的统一评估基准。它定义了五个核心多模态对话任务，并涵盖了六个数据集。此外，为了全面评估模型在所有任务上的性能，我们开发了一种新的评估指标VDscore，该指标基于层次分析过程（Analytic Hierarchy Process，AHP）方法。此外，我们还提供了一个简单而高效的基线模型VISIT（VISually-grounded dIalog Transformer），以促进通用多模态对话系统的进展。它逐步构建它的多模态能力",
