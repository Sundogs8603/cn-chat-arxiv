    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）已成功应用于诸如Web导航之类的交互式决策任务。尽管取得了不错的性能，但先前的方法隐含地假设模型只能以正向方式执行，在交互环境中仅提供正例轨迹作为上下文示例，教授模型如何进行推理。因此，模型无法处理更具挑战性的情况，例如错误，从而导致次优性能。为了解决这个问题，我们提出将交互任务建模为状态空间探索，其中LLM代理通过执行动作在预定义的一组状态之间进行转换以完成任务。这种形式化方法使得模型可以灵活地进行回溯，从而能够轻松从错误中恢复。我们在WebShop任务上评估我们提出的LASER代理。实验结果表明，我们的LASER代理明显优于以前的方法。",
