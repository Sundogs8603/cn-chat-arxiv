    "abstract": "Among creative professionals, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has sparked excitement over its capabilities and fear over unanticipated consequences. How does GenAI impact User Experience Design (UXD) practice, and are fears warranted? We interviewed 20 UX Designers, with diverse experience and across companies (startups to large enterprises). We probed them to characterize their practices, and sample their attitudes, concerns, and expectations. We found that experienced designers are confident in their originality, creativity, and empathic skills, and find GenAI's role as assistive. They emphasized the unique human factors of \"enjoyment\" and \"agency\", where humans remain the arbiters of \"AI alignment\". However, skill degradation, job replacement, and creativity exhaustion can adversely impact junior designers. We discuss implications for human-GenAI collaboration, specifically copyright and ownership, human creativity and agency, and AI literacy and access. Through the lens ",

    "translated_abstract": "在创意专业人员中，生成性人工智能（GenAI）引起了对其能力的兴奋和对未预期后果的担忧。GenAI如何影响用户体验设计（UXD）实践，并且这些担忧是否合理？我们采访了20位UX设计师，他们拥有丰富的经验，来自各种公司（创业公司到大型企业）。我们询问他们的实践特征，并了解他们的态度、关注点和期望。我们发现，经验丰富的设计师对他们的原创性、创造力和共情能力充满信心，并认为GenAI的角色是辅助性的。他们强调了\"享受\"和\"代理\"这两个独特的人类因素，在这两个方面人类仍然是\"AI对齐\"的仲裁者。然而，技能退化、工作替代和创造力枯竭可能对初级设计师产生负面影响。我们讨论了人-GenAI协作的影响，特别是版权和所有权、人类创造力和代理性，以及AI素养和获取方面。通过这个视角，我们将我们的发现与前人研究进行了比较。",
