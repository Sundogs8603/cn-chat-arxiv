    "translated_abstract": "当前一些最强大的语言模型都是专有系统，只能通过（通常是限制性的）网络或软件编程接口访问。这就是语言模型即服务（LMaaS）的范式。与可以完全访问模型的情况相反，如开放源代码模型的情况，这些封闭的语言模型对于评估、基准测试和测试造成了特定的挑战。本文的两个目标是：一方面，我们界定前述挑战如何作为对LMaaS的可访问性、可复制性、可靠性和可信度（ARRT）的障碍。我们系统地研究了与每个这四个方面的语言模型信息不足有关的问题。我们阐明了目前的解决方案，提出了一些建议，并强调了未来发展的方向。另一方面，本文是当前主要LMaaS现有知识的一站式集锦，提供了综合的信息。",
