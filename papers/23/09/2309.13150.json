Our approach leverages a smoothing distribution over the 2D pixel space instead of in the 3D physical space, eliminating the need for costly camera motion sampling and significantly enhancing the efficiency of robustness certifications.

    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，计算机视觉在自动驾驶和机器人领域取得了显著的进展。然而，深度学习的视觉感知模型在面对相机运动扰动时缺乏鲁棒性。目前用于评估鲁棒性的认证过程耗时且昂贵，因为需要在三维相机运动空间中进行蒙特卡洛采样得到大量图像投影。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖、高效且实用的框架，用于证明3D-2D投影变换对抗相机运动扰动的鲁棒性。我们的方法在二维像素空间而非三维物理空间中使用平滑分布，消除了昂贵的相机运动采样，并大大提高了鲁棒性认证的效率。通过像素级平滑分类器，我们能够使用一种均匀分区的技术完全上界投影误差。",
