    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，提出了解决各种实际问题的量子算法，例如数据搜索和分析、产品推荐和信用评分。对量子计算中的隐私和其他伦理问题的关注自然而然地增加。本文定义了一个形式化框架，用于检测量子算法的差分隐私违规行为。我们开发了一个检测算法，用于验证一个（带有噪声的）量子算法是否具有差分隐私，并在报告差分隐私违规时自动生成错误信息。该信息包括一对违反隐私的量子状态，以说明违规的原因。我们的算法采用了张量网络作为高效的数据结构，并在TensorFlow Quantum和TorchQuantum上执行，它们分别是著名机器学习平台TensorFlow和PyTorch的量子扩展。",
