    "translated_abstract": "研究人员利用Twitter和情感分析预测心血管疾病（CVD）的风险。我们通过审视推文中传达的情感，引入了一个新颖的与CVD相关的关键词词典。我们收集了来自美国18个州的推文，涵盖了阿巴拉契亚地区。采用VADER模型进行情感分析，我们将用户归类为潜在的CVD风险。采用机器学习（ML）模型评估个体的CVD风险，并随后将其应用于CDC数据集中的人口统计信息进行比较。我们考虑了各种性能评估指标，包括测试准确率，精确率，召回率，F1分数，马修斯相关系数（MCC）和科恩的Kappa分数（CK）。我们的研究结果表明，分析推文中的情感内容优于仅使用人口统计数据进行预测，能够识别出潜在风险患者的个体。这项研究强调了社交媒体在预测CVD风险方面的潜力。",
