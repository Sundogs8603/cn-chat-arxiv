    "translated_abstract": "在药物研究中，一种类似ChatGPT的药物化合物系统可能是一个改变游戏规则的因素，加快药物发现，增强我们对结构-活性关系的理解，指导前导化合物优化，帮助药物再利用，减少失败率并简化临床试验。本文通过开发一个名为DrugChat的原型系统，初步尝试在药物分子图上实现类似ChatGPT的能力。DrugChat的工作方式类似于ChatGPT。用户上传一个化合物分子图并提出各种关于该化合物的问题。DrugChat将以多轮互动的方式回答这些问题。DrugChat系统由一个图神经网络（GNN）、一个大型语言模型（LLM）和一个适配器组成。GNN将化合物分子图作为输入，学习该图的表示。适配器将GNN生成的图表示转换为LLM可接受的另一个表示。LLM接收该表示并回答用户的问题。",
