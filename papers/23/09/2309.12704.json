This paper presents a data-driven approach to detect smurfing, i.e., money launderers seeking to evade detection by breaking up large transactions into amounts under the secret thresholds.

An application to real data from a systemically important Danish bank finds no evidence of smurfing and, thus, no evidence of leaked confidential thresholds. An implementation of our approach will be available online, providing a free and easy-to-use tool for banks.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了打击洗钱行为，银行会对超过机密阈值的交易发出警报并进行审核。本文提出了一种基于数据驱动的方法来检测smurfing，即洗钱者通过将大额交易分割成低于阈值的金额来规避检测。该方法利用反事实分布的概念，并依赖于两个假设：（一）对于最大的财务交易来说，smurfing是不可行的；（二）洗钱者有动机使smurfed交易接近阈值。模拟结果表明，该方法可以在仅有0.1-0.5%的银行交易涉及smurfing的情况下检测到smurfing。对于来自丹麦一家具有系统性重要性的银行的真实数据的应用没有发现smurfing的证据，因此没有发现机密阈值泄露的证据。本方法的实现将可在线上提供，为银行提供一个免费且易于使用的工具。",
