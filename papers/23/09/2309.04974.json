    "translated_abstract": "赋予机器人像人类一样学习不断发展的技能而不是掌握单一任务的能力是机器人学习中的一个开放问题。尽管已经提出了多任务学习方法来解决这个问题，但他们很少关注任务推断。为了不断学习新任务，机器人首先需要推断出当前正在进行的任务，而不需要预定义的任务表示。在本文中，我们提出了一种自我监督的任务推断方法。我们的方法通过观察到的未标记示范的运动和效果部分的自组织来学习动作和意图嵌入，并通过联合动作-意图嵌入的自组织来学习高层行为嵌入。我们构建了一个行为匹配的自我监督学习目标，来训练一个新的任务推断网络（TINet）将未标记示范映射到其最近的行为嵌入，然后将其用作任务表示。",
