    "translated_abstract": "网络片上互连（NoC）广泛用作当今多核片上系统（SoC）设计中的内部通信结构。片上通信的安全性至关重要，因为利用共享的NoC中的任何漏洞对攻击者来说都是一个富矿。NoC安全依赖于对各种攻击的有效防范措施。我们研究了NoC架构中现有匿名路由协议的安全性。具体而言，本文作出了两个重要贡献。我们展示了现有的匿名路由对基于机器学习（ML）的流相关攻击是易受攻击的。我们提出了一种轻量级的匿名路由，使用流量混淆技术，可以抵御基于ML的流相关攻击。使用实际和合成流量进行的实验研究表明，我们提出的攻击能够成功地对抗NoC架构中最先进的匿名路由，对于多种流量模式的分类准确率高达99％，同时。",
