    "translated_abstract": "目前的机器学习方法在解决Bongard问题时存在困难。Bongard问题是一种需要从一组正负“支持”图像中推导出抽象“概念”，然后对于新的查询图像进行分类，判断它是否描述了关键概念的智力测试。在用于自然图像Bongard问题的基准测试Bongard-HOI中，现有方法的准确率仅达到了66%（偶然准确率为50%）。低准确率通常归因于神经网络缺乏发现类似人类符号规则的能力。我们指出，许多现有方法由于一个更简单的问题而失去了准确性：它们没有将支持集合中的信息作为一个整体加入，而是依赖于从单个支持中提取的信息。这是一个关键问题，因为与涉及对象分类的少样本学习任务不同，一个典型的Bongard问题中的“关键概念”只能使用多个正例和多个反例来区分。我们探索了一种解决方案，通过跨图像上下文来提高准确性。",
