In this paper, we assume a partial knowledge of the system faults and use the corresponding data to train a convolutional neural network. A combination of t-SNE method and clustering techniques is then employed to detect novel faults. Upon detection, the network is augmented using the new data.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管近年来在基于数据驱动的旋转机器故障诊断方面取得了一定的成功，这一领域仍然存在一些挑战。其中一个问题是系统可能在现场遇到的各种故障缺乏信息。本文假设对系统故障具有部分知识，并利用相应数据训练了一个卷积神经网络。然后使用t-SNE方法和聚类技术的组合来检测新的故障。在检测到故障后，利用新数据增强网络。最后，利用一个离心泵的测试设置来验证这个两阶段的方法论，实验结果显示在检测新故障方面具有高准确性。",
