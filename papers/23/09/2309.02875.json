    "translated_abstract": "多模态图像配准是许多医学应用中的关键预处理步骤。然而，由于不同成像模态之间复杂的强度关系，这是一个具有挑战性的任务，可能导致图像外观上的显著差异。无论是传统的还是基于深度学习的多模态图像配准的成功，都取决于选择适当的距离（或相似度）度量。特别是，深度学习配准算法在尝试对来自“未见过”模态的数据进行配准时精度不足甚至完全失败。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为Modality Agnostic Distance（MAD）的深度图像距离度量，它利用随机卷积来学习图像的固有几何特性，同时对大幅度外观变化具有鲁棒性。随机卷积是保持几何性质的模块，我们用它们来模拟无限数量的合成模态，在训练过程中消除了对齐配对数据的需求。",
