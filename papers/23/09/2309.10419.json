    "abstract": "With recent advances in generative AI, conversational models like ChatGPT have become feasible candidates for TAs. We investigate the practicality of using generative AI as TAs in introductory programming education by examining novice learners' interaction with TAs in a subgoal learning environment. To compare the learners' interaction and perception of the AI and human TAs, we conducted a between-subject study with 20 novice programming learners. Learners solve programming tasks by producing subgoals and subsolutions with the guidance of a TA. Our study shows that learners can solve tasks faster with comparable scores with AI TAs. Learners' perception of the AI TA is on par with that of human TAs in terms of speed and comprehensiveness of the replies and helpfulness, difficulty, and satisfaction of the conversation. Finally, we suggest guidelines to better design and utilize generative AI as TAs in programming education from the result of our chat log analysis.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着生成型AI的最新进展，像ChatGPT这样的对话模型成为了助教的可行候选人。我们通过研究初学者在子目标学习环境中与助教的互动来探讨使用生成型AI作为编程教育助教的实用性。为了比较学习者与AI助教和人类助教之间的互动和感知，我们进行了一项20名初学者编程学习者的组间研究。学习者通过产生子目标和子解决方案，并在助教的指导下解决编程任务。我们的研究表明，学习者能够以相当的得分更快地解决任务，并且对AI助教的认识与人类助教在回复的速度和详尽程度、对话的有用性、难度和满意度等方面相当。最后，我们提出了根据聊天记录分析结果更好地设计和利用生成型AI作为编程教育助教的指导方针。",
