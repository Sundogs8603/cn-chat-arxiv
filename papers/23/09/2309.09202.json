    "abstract": "The psychology of science is the least developed member of the family of science studies. It is growing, however, increasingly into a promising discipline. After a very brief review of this emerging sub-field of psychology, we call for it to be invited into the collection of social sciences that constitute the interdisciplinary field of science policy. Discussing the classic issue of resource allocation, this paper tries to indicate how prolific a new psychological conceptualization of this problem would be. Further, from a psychological perspective, this research will argue in favor of a more realistic conception of science which would be a complement to the existing one in science policy.",

    "translated_abstract": "科学心理学是科学研究家族中最不发达的成员。然而，它正在不断发展成为一个有前景的学科。在对这个新兴的心理学子领域进行简要回顾后，我们呼吁将其纳入构成科学政策跨学科领域的社会科学集合之中。本文讨论资源分配的经典问题，试图指出一种对这个问题的新心理学概念会有多么多产。此外，从心理学的角度出发，本研究将论述为科学政策中现有观念提供一个更加现实的补充。",
