    "translated_abstract": "室内3D点云数据的语义理解对于一系列后续应用非常重要，包括室内服务机器人、导航系统和数字孪生工程。全局特征对于实现高质量的室内点云语义和实例分割至关重要，因为它们提供了重要的长程上下文信息。为此，我们提出了JSMNet，它结合了多层网络和全局特征自注意力模块，共同分割三维点云的语义和实例。为了更好地表达室内目标的特征，我们设计了一个多分辨率特征自适应融合模块，考虑了由于扫描仪距离目标的变化而导致的点云密度差异。此外，我们提出了一个结合语义和实例特征的联合语义和实例分割框架，以达到优越的结果。我们在S3DIS上进行了实验，该数据集是一个大型的室内地物点云数据集。",
