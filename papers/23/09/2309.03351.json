    "translated_abstract": "合成孔径雷达（SAR）图像的分析是遥感应用中的重要步骤，由于其固有的散斑噪声，这是一个具有挑战性的问题。一种常见的解决方案是使用$G_I^0$分布模型化数据并提取其粗糙度信息，这样可以在后续图像处理任务中使用，如分割、分类和解释。这需要从SAR数据中快速而可靠地估计粗糙度参数，特别是对于高分辨率图像。不幸的是，传统的参数估计方法速度慢且容易出现估计失败。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于神经网络的估计框架，首先学习如何预测$G_I^0$样本的基本参数，然后可以用于估计未见数据的粗糙度。我们发现，这种方法导致了一个比传统估计方法更快、误差更小且难以出错的估计器。",
