    "translated_abstract": "DNA序列对齐涉及将短DNA读取分配到广泛的参考基因组上的最可能位置。这个过程对于各种基因组学分析至关重要，包括变异调用、转录组学和表观基因组学。传统方法经过数十年的改进，以两个步骤解决这个挑战：先进行基因组索引，然后进行高效搜索以确定给定读取的可能位置。在大规模语言模型（LLM）在将文本编码为嵌入向量方面取得成功的基础上，最近的研究努力探索了是否可以使用相同的Transformer架构为DNA序列生成数值表示。这样的模型已经在涉及分类短DNA序列的任务中显示出早期的潜力，例如检测编码和非编码区域以及识别增强子和启动子序列。然而，序列分类任务的性能并不能直接应用于序列对齐任务，对齐任务的关键是在保持序列相似性的同时找到最佳的对应位置。",
