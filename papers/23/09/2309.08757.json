    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in characterizing circular data found in biological systems. Such data are wide ranging and varied, from signal phase in neural recordings to nucleotide sequences in round genomes. Traditional clustering algorithms are often inadequate due to their limited ability to distinguish differences in the periodic component. Current clustering schemes that work in a polar coordinate system have limitations, such as being only angle-focused or lacking generality. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new analysis framework that utilizes projections onto a cylindrical coordinate system to better represent objects in a polar coordinate system. Using the mathematical properties of circular data, we show our approach always finds the correct clustering result within the reconstructed dataset, given sufficient periodic repetitions of the data. Our approach is generally applicable and adaptable and can be incorporated into most state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于在生物系统中发现的循环数据，越来越多的人对其进行特征化感兴趣。这些数据范围广泛，多种多样，从神经记录中的信号相位到圆形基因组中的核苷酸序列。传统的聚类算法往往由于其对周期性组成部分的差异有限，而显得不够适用。目前在极坐标系统中工作的聚类方案存在一些限制，比如仅专注于角度或缺乏通用性。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一种新的分析框架，利用投影到柱状坐标系统来更好地表示极坐标系统中的对象。利用循环数据的数学属性，我们展示了我们的方法在重建的数据集中，只要数据具有足够的周期重复，总能找到正确的聚类结果。我们的方法具有普适性和可调性，并可以融入大多数最先进的聚类算法中。",
