While learning-based registration methods have recently become the state-of-the-art approach for most medical image registration tasks, these methods have yet to make inroads into breast image registration due to certain difficulties-the lack of rich texture information in breast MR images and the need for the deformations to be diffeomophic. In this work, we propose learning strategies for breast MR image registration that are amenable to diffeomorphic constraints, together with early experimental results from in-silico and in-vivo experiments.

    "translated_abstract": "在乳房手术规划中，准确地登记不同体位下的MR图像有潜力改善乳腺癌治疗过程中肿瘤的本地化。虽然基于学习的登记方法最近已经成为大多数医学影像登记任务的最先进方法，但由于乳房MR图像中缺乏丰富的纹理信息以及变形需要具有微分同胚的困难，这些方法尚未在乳房图像登记方面取得进展。在这项工作中，我们提出了适用于乳房MR图像登记的具有微分同胚约束的学习策略，并提供了来自硅激发和体内实验的早期实验结果。这项工作的一个关键贡献是一个登记网络，除了提供微分同胚保证外，还能产生更优的乳房图像登记结果。",
