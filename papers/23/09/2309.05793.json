    "abstract": "Personalized text-to-image generation has emerged as a powerful and sought-after tool, empowering users to create customized images based on their specific concepts and prompts. However, existing approaches to personalization encounter multiple challenges, including long tuning times, large storage requirements, the necessity for multiple input images per identity, and limitations in preserving identity and editability. To address these obstacles, we present PhotoVerse, an innovative methodology that incorporates a dual-branch conditioning mechanism in both text and image domains, providing effective control over the image generation process. Furthermore, we introduce facial identity loss as a novel component to enhance the preservation of identity during training. Remarkably, our proposed PhotoVerse eliminates the need for test time tuning and relies solely on a single facial photo of the target identity, significantly reducing the resource cost associated with image generation.

    "translated_abstract": "个性化文本到图像生成已成为一种强大且受追捧的工具，赋予用户根据特定概念和提示创建定制图像的能力。然而，现有的个性化方法面临诸多挑战，包括长时间调参、大量存储需求、对每个身份需要多个输入图像的必要性以及在保留身份和可编辑性方面的限制。为了解决这些障碍，我们提出了一种创新的方法——PhotoVerse，在文本和图像领域中引入了双分支调节机制，从而有效控制图像生成过程。此外，我们还引入了面部身份损失作为一种新颖的组成部分，提升了训练过程中身份保留的能力。值得注意的是，我们的PhotoVerse方法无需测试时间调参，仅依赖目标身份的一张面部照片，显著降低了图像生成所需的资源成本。",
