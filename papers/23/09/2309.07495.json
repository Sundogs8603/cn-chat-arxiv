    "translated_abstract": "说话人脸生成 (TFG) 旨在重建面部运动，以实现从音频和面部特征中获得高自然度的唇部运动。现有的 TFG 方法在产生自然和逼真的图像方面取得了显著进展。然而，大多数工作很少考虑视觉质量。在跨模式生成方法中，同时保证唇部同步和避免视觉质量下降是一项具有挑战性的任务。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种通用的高清牙齿修复网络，称为HDTR-Net，适用于任意的TFG方法。HDTR-Net可以以极快的速度增强牙齿区域，并保持同步和时间上的一致性。特别地，我们提出了一种Fine-Grained Feature Fusion (FGFF) 模块，有效地捕捉牙齿周围细纹理特征信息，并使用这些特征对特征图进行细粒度处理以提高牙齿的清晰度。大量实验证明...",
