    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了时间命题时态逻辑（TPTL）的{0, ∞}片段的可决定性。我们证明了TPTL的可满足性检查在TPTL$^{0, ∞}$中是PSPACE-Complete的。此外，即使是它的1变量片段（1-TPTL$^{0, ∞}$），与其可满足性检查是EXPSPACE-Complete的Metric Interval Temporal Logic（MITL）相比，更加表达力强。因此，我们在计算上更容易检查可满足性的逻辑表达式是更加表达力强的。据我们所知，TPTL$^{0, ∞}$是第一个不对定时词（例如有界变异度，有界时间等）施加任何限制/约束即可判定可满足性的TPTL的多变量片段。通过将其规约到一种称为单边非时态交替自动机的空类别的空检查问题，我们得到PSPACE的会员。该规约涉及多个时钟的交替时控自动机。",
