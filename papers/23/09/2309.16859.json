    "translated_abstract": "NeRFs已经实现了包括复杂的头发和皮肤在内的人脸高度真实的合成，这些方法通常需要大量的多视图输入图像，使该过程对硬件要求较高且繁琐，限制了它在无约束环境中的适用性。我们提出了一种新颖的体积化人脸先验，使得能合成先前训练分布外的超高分辨率的新视图。这个先验模型由一个与身份相关的NeRF组成，经过在已知摄像机标定的多样人类低分辨率多视图图像数据集上训练。尽管训练身份数量有限，通过简单的基于稀疏标记点的3D对齐，我们的模型能够学习到一个平滑的几何和外观的潜在空间。通过将模型拟合到任意分辨率的2或3个摄像机视图，可以获得高质量的新对象的体积化表示。",
