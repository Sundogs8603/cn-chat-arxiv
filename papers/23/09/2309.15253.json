    "abstract": "Daily fantasy sports (DFS) are weekly or daily online contests where real-game performances of individual players are converted to fantasy points (FPTS). Users select players for their lineup to maximize their FPTS within a set player salary cap. This paper focuses on (1) the development of a method to forecast NFL player performance under uncertainty and (2) determining an optimal lineup to maximize FPTS under a set salary limit. A supervised learning neural network was created and used to project FPTS based on past player performance (2018 NFL regular season for this work) prior to the upcoming week. These projected FPTS were used in a mixed integer linear program to find the optimal lineup. The performance of resultant lineups was compared to randomly-created lineups. On average, the optimal lineups outperformed the random lineups. The generated lineups were then compared to real-world lineups from users on DraftKings. The generated lineups generally fell in approximately the 31st p",

    "translated_abstract": "每日奇幻体育是每周或每日的在线比赛，其中个人运动员的真实比赛表现被转换为奇幻分数（FPTS）。用户根据设定的球员工资上限选择阵容以最大化他们的FPTS。本文针对两个重点进行研究：（1）在不确定性下预测NFL球员表现的方法的开发，（2）在设定的工资限制下确定最佳阵容以最大化FPTS。创建了一个监督学习神经网络，根据过去的球员表现（本工作使用2018NFL常规赛季）预测FPTS，并将这些预测的FPTS用于混合整数线性规划中寻找最佳阵容。将生成的阵容的性能与随机生成的阵容进行了比较。平均而言，最佳阵容的性能优于随机阵容。然后将生成的阵容与DraftKings用户的真实阵容进行了比较。生成的阵容通常接近31%的真实阵容。",
