    "abstract": "The article develops a general equilibrium model where power relations are central in the determination of unemployment, profitability, and income distribution. The paper contributes to the market forces versus institutions debate by providing a unified model capable of identifying key interrelations between technical and institutional changes in the economy. Empirically, the model is used to gauge the relative roles of technology and institutions in the behavior of the labor share, the unemployment rate, the capital-output ratio, and business profitability and demonstrates how they complement each other in providing an adequate narrative to the structural changes of the US economy.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文开发了一个平衡理论模型，其中权力关系在确定失业率、盈利能力和收入分配方面起着核心作用。该论文通过提供一个统一的模型，能够识别经济中技术和制度变化之间的关键相互关系，对市场力量与制度之争做出了贡献。从实证上来看，该模型用于衡量技术和制度在劳动力份额、失业率、资本产出比率和商业盈利能力行为中的相对作用，并展示了它们如何相互补充，为美国经济结构变化提供了充分的解释。",

It empirically demonstrates how these factors complement each other in explaining the structural changes in the US economy."
