    "translated_abstract": "事件关系抽取（ERE）旨在从文本中提取多种类型的事件关系。然而，现有方法单独将事件关系分类为不同类别，无法充分捕捉这些关系的内在语义。为了全面理解它们的内在语义，本文针对每种类型的事件关系获取原型表示，并提出了一种原型加强匹配（ProtoEM）框架，用于联合抽取多种类型的事件关系。具体而言，ProtoEM以两步方式提取事件关系，即原型表示和原型匹配。在第一步中，为了捕捉不同事件关系的内涵，ProtoEM利用示例来表示与这些关系相对应的原型。随后，为了捕捉事件关系之间的相互依赖性，它为与这些关系相对应的原型构建了一个依赖图，并利用图神经网络进行匹配。",
