    "translated_abstract": "立场检测是通过推断一个人在特定问题上的立场或观点，以推断对于普遍或有争议的话题的普遍看法，例如COVID-19疫情期间的健康政策。现有的立场检测模型在训练时往往在单个领域（例如COVID-19）和特定目标话题（例如口罩规定）上表现良好，但在其他领域或目标中往往表现不佳，这是由于数据的分布偏移。然而，构建高性能的领域特定立场检测模型需要大量与目标领域相关的已标注数据，但这样的数据集往往不容易获取。这就面临着一个挑战，因为标注数据的过程代价高昂且耗时。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的立场检测模型，称为通过对比学习和反事实生成进行领域自适应的跨目标立场检测（STANCE-C3）。",
