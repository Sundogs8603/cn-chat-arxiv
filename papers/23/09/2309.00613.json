We formalize this pragmatic problem setting as Iterative Multi-granular Editing. While there has been substantial progress with diffusion-based models for image synthesis and editing, they are all one shot (i.e., no iterative editing capabilities) and do not naturally yield multi-granular control (i.e., covering the full spectrum of local-to-global edits). To overcome these drawbacks, we propose EMILIE: Iterative Multi-granular Image Editor. EMILIE introduces a novel latent iteration strategy, which re-purposes a pre-trained diffusion model to facilitate iterative editing. This is complemented by a gradient control opera",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，文本引导的图像合成的进展极大地改变了创意专业人员生成艺术和审美上令人愉悦的视觉资产的方式。为了充分支持这样的创意努力，该过程应具备以下能力：1）迭代地编辑生成的图像，2）控制所需变化的空间范围（全局、局部或介于两者之间）。我们将这个实用的问题设定正式化为迭代多粒度编辑。虽然在图像合成和编辑方面，基于扩散模型取得了重大进展，但它们都是一次性操作（即没有迭代编辑能力），并且不能自然产生多粒度控制（即涵盖从局部到全局编辑的全谱）。为了克服这些缺点，我们提出了EMILIE：迭代多粒度图像编辑器。EMILIE引入了一种新颖的潜在迭代策略，利用预训练的扩散模型来促进迭代编辑。同时，还引入了梯度控制操作来实现对所需变化的粒度控制。",
