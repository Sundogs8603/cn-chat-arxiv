    "abstract": "The goal of this thesis is to study the use of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance as to build a descriptor of sample complexity in classification problems. The idea is to use the fact that the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance is a metric in the space of measures that also takes into account the geometry and topology of the underlying metric space. We associate to each class of points a measure and thus study the geometrical information that we can obtain from the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance between those measures. We show that a large Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance between those measures allows to conclude that there exists a 1-Lipschitz classifier that classifies well the classes of points. We also discuss the limitation of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance as a descriptor.",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文的目标是研究在分类问题中使用康托罗维奇-鲁宾斯坦距离来构建样本复杂性的描述子。我们的思想是利用康托罗维奇-鲁宾斯坦距离作为度量空间中度量和拓扑的一种方法。我们为每个类别的点关联一个度量，并研究可以从这些度量之间的康托罗维奇-鲁宾斯坦距离中获取的几何信息。我们证明了在这些度量之间存在大的康托罗维奇-鲁宾斯坦距离就可以得出存在一个能够良好分类点类别的1-立切分类器的结论。我们还讨论了康托罗维奇-鲁宾斯坦距离作为描述子的局限性。",
