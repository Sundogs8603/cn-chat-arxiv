However, despite the growing volume of literature in this field, there remains a notable absence of a unified dataset and a fair benchmark to evaluate and compare existing approaches. To address this crucial gap, we present G4SATBench, the first benchmark study that establishes a comprehensive evaluation framework for GNN-based SAT solvers. In G4SATBench, we meticulously curate a large and diverse set of SAT datasets comprising 7 problems with 3 difficulty levels and benchmark a broad range of GNN models across various prediction tasks, training objectives, and inference algorithms. To explore the learning abilities and comprehend the strengths and limitations of GNN-based SAT solvers, we also compare their solving processes with the heuristics in search-based SAT solvers",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，图神经网络(GNNs)作为解决布尔可满足性问题(SAT)的一种有希望的方法出现了，为传统的回溯或局部搜索SAT求解器提供了潜在的替代方案。然而，尽管这个领域的文献数量不断增长，但仍然缺乏一个统一的数据集和公正的基准来评估和比较现有的方法。为了填补这个关键的空白，我们提出了G4SATBench，这是第一个为基于GNN的SAT求解器建立全面评估框架的基准研究。在G4SATBench中，我们精心策划了一个包含7个问题和3个难度级别的大型多样化SAT数据集，并在各种预测任务、训练目标和推理算法下对广泛的GNN模型进行基准测试。为了探索基于GNN的SAT求解器的学习能力，并理解其优点和局限性，我们还将它们的求解过程与基于搜索的SAT求解器中的启发式方法进行比较。",
