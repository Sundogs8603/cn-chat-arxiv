    "translated_abstract": "给定一组在$\\mathbb{R}^d$中的$n$个向量，\\emph{行列式最大化}问题的目标是选择具有最大体积的$k$个向量。行列式最大化是确定性点过程（DPP）的MAP推断任务，最近在建模多样性方面引起了相当大的关注。由于大多数问题应用使用大量数据，因此在相关的\\textit{可组合的核心集合}设置中对该问题进行了研究。特别地，[Indyk-Mahabadi-OveisGharan-Rezaei--SODA'20, ICML'19]表明可以获得近似度为$\\tilde O(k)^k$的问题的可组合核心集合，且局部搜索算法实现了近乎最优的近似保证$O(k)^{2k}$。在这项工作中，我们展示了广泛使用的贪心算法也可以提供具有几乎最优近似因子$O(k)^{3k}$的可组合核心集合，这改进了先前已知保证$C^{k^2}$的情况，并支持先前实验的结果。",
