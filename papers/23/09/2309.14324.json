    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel voice conversion (VC) model, guided by text instructions such as \"articulate slowly with a deep tone\" or \"speak in a cheerful boyish voice\". Unlike traditional methods that rely on reference utterances to determine the attributes of the converted speech, our model adds versatility and specificity to voice conversion. The proposed VC model is a neural codec language model which processes a sequence of discrete codes, resulting in the code sequence of converted speech. It utilizes text instructions as style prompts to modify the prosody and emotional information of the given speech. In contrast to previous approaches, which often rely on employing separate encoders like prosody and content encoders to handle different aspects of the source speech, our model handles various information of speech in an end-to-end manner. Experiments have demonstrated the impressive capabilities of our model in comprehending instructions and delivering reasonable results.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新颖的语音转换模型，该模型通过文本指令如\"慢慢清晰地说话，声音低沉\"或\"以快乐的少年声音说话\"来指导转换过程。与传统方法不同，该模型增加了语音转换的通用性和特异性。该提出的语音转换模型是一个神经编解码器语言模型，通过处理一系列离散编码，得到转换后的语音编码序列。它利用文本指令作为样式提示，修改给定语音的韵律和情感信息。与之前的方法相比，该模型以端到端的方式处理语音的各种信息，而不需要使用独立的编码器处理源语音的不同方面，如韵律和内容。实验证明了我们模型在理解指令并产生合理结果方面的卓越能力。",
