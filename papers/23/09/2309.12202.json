    "translated_abstract": "精神分裂症（SZ）是一种常见的精神障碍，其特征为认知、情绪和行为改变。SZ的症状包括幻觉、错觉、妄想、缺乏动力和注意力难度。诊断SZ需要使用各种工具，包括临床访谈、体格检查、心理评估、《精神障碍诊断与统计手册》（DSM）和神经影像技术。脑电图（EEG）记录是一种重要的功能性神经影像模态，可以提供有关SZ期间脑功能的宝贵见解。然而，脑电信号分析对神经学家和科学家来说存在艺术品、长期记录和多通道使用的挑战。为了解决这些挑战，研究人员引入了人工智能（AI）技术，包括传统的机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）方法，以辅助SZ诊断。本研究对这些方法进行了综述。",
