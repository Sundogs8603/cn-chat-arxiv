    "abstract": "In this work, an image translation model is implemented to produce synthetic amyloid-beta PET images from structural MRI that are quantitatively accurate. Image pairs of amyloid-beta PET and structural MRI were used to train the model. We found that the synthetic PET images could be produced with a high degree of similarity to truth in terms of shape, contrast and overall high SSIM and PSNR. This work demonstrates that performing structural to quantitative image translation is feasible to enable the access amyloid-beta information from only MRI.",
