    "translated_abstract": "视觉Transformer在现代计算机视觉领域中已经成为一种强大的架构。然而，它在某些图像领域的应用，如显微镜和卫星成像，面临着独特的挑战。在这些领域中，图像通常包含多个通道，每个通道都携带着语义上不同和独立的信息。此外，模型必须对输入通道的稀疏性表现出鲁棒性，在训练或测试过程中可能没有密集可用的通道。在本文中，我们提出了对ViT架构的修改，增强了对输入通道之间的推理，并引入了分层通道采样(HCS)作为一种附加的正则化技术，以确保在测试过程中仅出现部分通道时的鲁棒性。我们提出的模型ChannelViT独立地构建补丁令牌并利用可学习的通道嵌入将其添加到补丁令牌中，类似于位置嵌入。我们进行了评估",
