    "translated_abstract": "已经提出了一些用于测量和排名学者研究出版记录的引用指数。其中一些最著名的指数，如赫希和Woeginger提出的指数，旨在高度奖励那些在产出（发表论文数量）和影响（论文被引频率）之间达到一定平衡的记录。很少被引用的大量出版物将得分较低，而被大量引用的极少数论文也不会得分较高。本文讨论了三种新的引用指数，其中一种在[FHLB]中独立提出。每个指数都基于标度不变的概念，这是约翰·纳什解决两人谈判问题的基础。我们主要关注其中一种引用指数，这是赫希指数的一个标度不变版本。我们认为它比原先的指数具有优势：它在子学科内产生更公平的排名，更具决定性（更细致地区分，减少并列），并且更具动态性（随时间增长）。",
