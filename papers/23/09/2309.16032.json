    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑一个未知的非线性动力系统，其已知是耗散的。本文的目标是学习一个神经动力模型，以逼近这个系统，并在模型中保持耗散性质。一般来说，在神经网络训练过程中施加耗散性约束是一个困难的问题，目前没有已知的技术可以解决。本文分为两个阶段解决了学习耗散神经动力系统模型的问题。首先，我们学习一个无约束的神经动力模型，该模型能够紧密逼近系统的动力学行为。然后，我们导出足够的条件来扰动神经动力模型的权重，以确保耗散性质，并在保持模型与非线性系统轨迹拟合的同时扰动偏差。我们证明了这两个扰动问题可以独立求解，从而获得一个保证为耗散的神经动力模型，同时紧密逼近非线性系统。",
