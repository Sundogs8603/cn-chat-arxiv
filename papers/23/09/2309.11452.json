    "translated_abstract": "布尔可满足性问题（SAT）是最典型的NP完全问题，具有极大的实际重要性。这个问题的一种重要求解器类别是随机局部搜索（SLS）算法，通过迭代和随机更新候选解来求解。最近，在理论计算机科学领域取得了重大突破，建立了足够的条件，以确保SLS求解器能够有效地求解SAT实例，只要它们可以访问合适的“神谕”，从实例特定的分布中提供样本，利用实例的局部结构。受这些结果以及神经网络在学习大型数据集中常见结构的良好能力的启发，本研究利用图神经网络训练了神谕，并在两个SLS求解器上对具有不同难度的随机SAT实例进行了评估。我们发现，访问基于GNN的神谕显著提高了两个求解器的性能，使它们平均能够解决17个实例。",
