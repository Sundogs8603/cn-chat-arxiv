    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought reasoning, a cognitive process fundamental to human intelligence, has garnered significant attention in the realm of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. However, there still remains a lack of a comprehensive survey for this arena. To this end, we take the first step and present a thorough survey of this research field carefully and widely. We use X-of-Thought to refer to Chain-of-Thought in a broad sense. In detail, we systematically organize the current research according to the taxonomies of methods, including XoT construction, XoT structure variants, and enhanced XoT. Additionally, we describe XoT with frontier applications, covering planning, tool use, and distillation. Furthermore, we address challenges and discuss some future directions, including faithfulness, multi-modal, and theory. We hope this survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers seeking to innovate within the domain of chain-of-thought reasoning.",

    "translated_abstract": "思维链推理是人类智能的基本认知过程，在人工智能和自然语言处理领域引起了广泛关注。然而，目前仍缺乏一份全面的调查报告。为此，我们迈出了第一步，仔细广泛地概述了这个研究领域。我们用“X-of-Thought”来指代广义上的思维链推理。具体而言，我们根据方法的分类体系对当前的研究进行了系统组织，包括思维链的构建、结构变体和增强技术。此外，我们描述了思维链在规划、工具使用和提炼等领域的前沿应用。此外，我们还讨论了一些挑战和未来的方向，包括忠实度、多模态和理论等。我们希望这份调查报告能成为寻求在思维链推理领域创新的研究人员的宝贵资源。",
