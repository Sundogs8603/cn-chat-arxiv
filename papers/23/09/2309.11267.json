    "translated_abstract": "监测基础设施的表面裂缝对于结构健康监测至关重要。自动视觉检测提供了一种有效的解决方案，特别是在难以到达的区域。机器学习方法已经证明了它们的有效性，但通常需要大量的注释数据集进行监督训练。一旦检测到裂缝，监测其严重程度通常需要对损害进行精确的分割。然而，对于分割而言，图像的像素级注释是一项劳动密集型的工作。为了减少这种成本，可以利用可解释人工智能（XAI）从分类器的解释中导出分割结果，仅需要弱图像级别的监督。本文提出将这种方法应用于分割和监测表面裂缝。我们评估了各种XAI方法的性能，并研究了这种方法如何促进严重程度量化和生长监测。结果表明，虽然得到的分割掩模可能较低质量，但采用这种方法仍能有效地进行裂纹分割。",
