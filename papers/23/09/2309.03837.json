    "translated_abstract": "多任务学习（MTL）是深度学习中一种强大的方法，利用多个任务的信息在训练过程中提升模型性能。在医学影像领域，MTL已经展现出解决各种任务的巨大潜力。然而，现有的医学影像MTL架构在跨任务信息共享方面存在局限，降低了MTL的潜在性能改进。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于注意力的MTL框架，以更好地利用任务之间的相互作用。具体而言，我们提出了一种跨任务注意力网络（CTAN），利用跨任务注意力机制通过任务间的交互来整合信息。我们在包括放射治疗计划预测、色素性皮肤损伤分割和诊断等不同领域和任务的四个医学影像数据集上验证了CTAN的有效性。",
