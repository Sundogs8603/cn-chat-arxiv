    "translated_abstract": "帕金森病（PD）是一种神经退行性疾病，通常表现为语音和声音功能障碍。虽然利用语音数据进行PD检测在临床应用中有很大潜力，但目前广泛使用的深度学习模型在不同年龄发病阶段存在公平性问题。这些深度模型在老年人群（年龄> 55岁）中表现良好，但对年轻人群（年龄≤55岁）的准确性较低。通过我们的调查，老年人和年轻人之间的差异是由于1）数据集不平衡和2）早发患者常见的较轻症状引起的。然而，传统的去偏见方法不实用，因为它们通常会降低大多数群体的预测准确性，同时减小差异。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的去偏见方法，使用基于GradCAM的特征屏蔽结合集成模型，确保公平性和准确性均不受损。具体来说，基于GradCAM的特征屏蔽选择特征，合并了ensemble models，",
