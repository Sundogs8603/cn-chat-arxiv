    "abstract": "Reliability is extremely important for large-scale cloud systems like Microsoft 365. Cloud failures such as disk failure, node failure, etc. threaten service reliability, resulting in online service interruptions and economic loss. Existing works focus on predicting cloud failures and proactively taking action before failures happen. However, they suffer from poor data quality like data missing in model training and prediction, which limits the performance. In this paper, we focus on enhancing data quality through data imputation by the proposed Diffusion+, a sample-efficient diffusion model, to impute the missing data efficiently based on the observed data. Our experiments and application practice show that our model contributes to improving the performance of the downstream failure prediction task.",

    "translated_abstract": "可靠性对于像微软365这样的大规模云系统非常重要。云故障（如磁盘故障、节点故障等）威胁到服务的可靠性，导致在线服务中断和经济损失。现有的工作侧重于预测云故障并在故障发生之前采取积极行动。然而，他们在模型训练和预测中存在数据缺失等数据质量差的问题，这限制了性能。本文通过提出的Diffusion+（一种样本效率高的扩散模型），通过观察到的数据高效地插补缺失数据，以提高数据质量。我们的实验和应用实践表明，我们的模型有助于提高下游故障预测任务的性能。",
