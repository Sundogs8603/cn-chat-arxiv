    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）具备良好的少样本能力，但在上下文学习（ICL）的标准范式中存在以下弊端：易受选定演示的影响，生成这些演示的复杂性。本文提出了对于ICL，人工生成的演示是否有必要的基本问题，并提出了自反思提示策略（SEC），这是一种不依赖人工演示的范例。SEC的关键点在于，不使用手工制作的示例作为ICL中的演示，而是要求LLMs首先自行创建演示，然后生成最终输出。SEC是一种灵活的框架，可适应原始ICL和“思维链”（CoT），并且更加便捷：因为可以节省示例和理由的手动生成过程。在算术推理、常识推理和多任务语言理解方面进行了大量实验。",
