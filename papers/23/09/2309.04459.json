    "translated_abstract": "稀疏奖励强化学习中的探索具有困难，因为需要通过长期的、协调的行动序列才能获得任何奖励。而且，在连续的行动空间中，可能的行动数量是无穷多的，这只会增加探索的难度。为了解决这些问题，一类方法通过在同一领域收集的交互数据中形成时间上延伸的行动，通常称为技巧，并在这个新的行动空间上进行策略的优化。通常这样的方法在连续行动空间中需要一个漫长的预训练阶段，在强化学习开始之前形成技巧。鉴于先前的证据表明在这些任务中并不需要完整的连续行动空间，我们提出了一种新颖的技巧生成方法，包括两个组成部分。首先，我们通过聚类将行动空间离散化，然后我们利用从自然语言处理借鉴来的分词技术。",
