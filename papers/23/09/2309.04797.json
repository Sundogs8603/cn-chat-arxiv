    "abstract": "Commit messages (CMs) are an essential part of version control. By providing important context in regard to what has changed and why, they strongly support software maintenance and evolution. But writing good CMs is difficult and often neglected by developers. So far, there is no tool suitable for practice that automatically assesses how well a CM is written, including its meaning and context. Since this task is challenging, we ask the research question: how well can the CM quality, including semantics and context, be measured with machine learning methods? By considering all rules from the most popular CM quality guideline, creating datasets for those rules, and training and evaluating state-of-the-art machine learning models to check those rules, we can answer the research question with: sufficiently well for practice, with the lowest F$_1$ score of 82.9\\%, for the most challenging task. We develop a full-fledged open-source framework that checks all these CM quality rules. It is use",

    "translated_abstract": "提交消息（CMs）是版本控制的重要组成部分。通过提供有关更改内容和原因的重要上下文，它们极大地支持软件维护和演进。但是撰写良好的CMs是困难的，开发人员经常忽视。到目前为止，还没有适合实践的工具可以自动评估CM的编写质量，包括其含义和上下文。鉴于此任务的挑战性，我们提出研究问题：机器学习方法能够如何衡量CM质量，包括语义和上下文？通过考虑最流行的CM质量指南的所有规则，创建这些规则的数据集，并训练和评估最先进的机器学习模型来检查这些规则，我们可以回答这个研究问题：对于最具挑战性的任务，实践中具有82.9％的最低F1分数足够好。我们开发了一个全面的开源框架，检查所有这些CM质量规则。它可以用来辅助开发人员编写更好的CMs。",
