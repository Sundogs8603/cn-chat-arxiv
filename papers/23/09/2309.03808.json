    "translated_abstract": "给定多个项目之间的成对比较，如何对它们进行排名以使得排名与观察相匹配？这个问题被称为排名聚合，在体育、推荐系统和其他网络应用中已经找到了许多应用。由于找到最小化不匹配的全局排名通常是NP困难的（称为Kemeny优化），我们将重点放在Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi离群点（ERO）模型上。在这个排名问题中，每个成对比较是真实分数差异的被损坏副本。我们研究了基于未归一化和归一化数据矩阵的谱排名算法。关键是理解它们在从观察数据中恢复每个项目的潜在分数方面的性能。这归结为推导未归一化/归一化数据矩阵的前几个特征向量和其总体对应物之间的逐个项扰动误差界限。通过使用留出技术，我们提供了一个更准确的$\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm扰动误差界限。",
