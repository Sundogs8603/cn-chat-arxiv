    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种自监督异常检测技术，称为SeMAnD，用于检测多模态地理空间数据中的几何异常。地理空间数据包括获取和衍生的异构数据模态，我们将其转换为语义上有意义的、类似图像的张量，以解决多模态数据的表示、对齐和融合的挑战。SeMAnD由两部分组成：（i）一种简单的数据增强策略，称为RandPolyAugment，能够生成多样化的矢量几何增强，以及（ii）具有三个组件的自监督训练目标，激励学习对一种模态中的局部变化具有区别性的多模态数据表示，这种变化在其他模态中没有得到证实。在地理空间异常检测中，检测局部缺陷至关重要，即使是小的异常（如移位、错误连接、畸形或缺失的多边形矢量几何，如道路、建筑物、地表覆盖等）也是有害的。",
