    "translated_abstract": "文本增强是一种从不足资源的语料库中构造合成数据以提高预测性能的技术。合成数据生成在许多领域中很常见。然而，最近，文本增强已经在自然语言处理（NLP）中出现，以提升下游任务的效果。目前最先进的文本增强技术之一是易于数据增强（EDA），它通过注入和替换同义词以及随机排列句子来增加训练数据。EDA的一个主要障碍是需要多功能和完整的同义词词典，在低资源语言中很难找到。为了提高EDA的实用性，我们提出了两种扩展方法：易于分布式数据增强（EDDA）和类型特定的相似词替换（TSSR），它使用语义词上下文信息和词性标记来进行词替换和增强。在广泛的实证评估中，我们展示了所提出方法的实用性",
