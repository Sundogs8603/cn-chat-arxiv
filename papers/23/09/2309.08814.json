    "translated_abstract": "非道路自主导航的主要挑战之一是缺乏可以用于规划机器人路径的地图或道路标志。经典的路径规划方法大多假设已知完美的环境，而不考虑在非道路环境中检测地形和障碍物时固有的感知和传感不确定性。最近在计算机视觉和深度神经网络方面的研究推动了从原始图像中进行地形可通过性分割的能力；然而，使用这些噪声分割地图进行导航和路径规划的可行性尚未得到充分探索。为了解决这个问题，本研究提出了一种基于不确定性感知的路径规划方法 URA*，使用空中图像进行非道路环境下的自主导航。首先使用集成的卷积神经网络 (CNN) 模型对感兴趣区域的空中图像进行像素级可通过性估计。",
