    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了转化机器学习（TML）在药物发现中的应用和性能。作为一种元学习算法，TML在利用不同领域的共同属性方面表现出色，从而开发出超越传统模型的复合模型。药物发现过程复杂耗时，TML能够提供更好的预测精度、改善可解释性和更大的泛化能力，因此能够为此过程带来巨大的益处。我们探索了不同机器学习分类器的有效性，发现没有单个分类器具有明显的优势，因此考虑了集成分类器，如随机森林。我们的研究结果表明，随着训练数据集数量的增加，TML在性能上超过了基本的机器学习（ML），这是由于它能够更好地近似正确的假设、克服局部最优和扩展可表示函数的空间，通过结合不同分类器的能力。然而，这种超越只在训练数据集数量足够时才能实现。",
