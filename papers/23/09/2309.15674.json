    "abstract": "Designing effective automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for Code-Switching (CS) often depends on the availability of the transcribed CS resources. To address data scarcity, this paper introduces Speech Collage, a method that synthesizes CS data from monolingual corpora by splicing audio segments. We further improve the smoothness quality of audio generation using an overlap-add approach. We investigate the impact of generated data on speech recognition in two scenarios: using in-domain CS text and a zero-shot approach with synthesized CS text. Empirical results highlight up to 34.4% and 16.2% relative reductions in Mixed-Error Rate and Word-Error Rate for in-domain and zero-shot scenarios, respectively. Lastly, we demonstrate that CS augmentation bolsters the model's code-switching inclination and reduces its monolingual bias.",

    "translated_abstract": "设计有效的用于混合语言的自动语音识别（ASR）系统往往取决于可获得的混合语资源的有效性。为了解决数据稀缺的问题，本文引入了语音拼贴方法，通过拼接音频片段从单语语料中合成混合语数据。我们进一步通过重叠添加的方法提高了音频生成的平滑度。我们研究了生成数据对两种情况下的语音识别的影响：使用领域内混合语文本和使用合成的混合语文本的零样本方法。实证结果显示，在领域内和零样本情况下，混合错误率和词错误率分别相对减少了34.4%和16.2%。最后，我们证明了混合语言增强了模型的混合倾向并减少了单语倾向。",
