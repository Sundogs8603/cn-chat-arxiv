    "abstract": "Recently, it has been exposed that some modern facial recognition systems could discriminate specific demographic groups and may lead to unfair attention with respect to various facial attributes such as gender and origin. The main reason are the biases inside datasets, unbalanced demographics, used to train theses models. Unfortunately, collecting a large-scale balanced dataset with respect to various demographics is impracticable.  In this paper, we investigate as an alternative the generation of a balanced and possibly bias-free synthetic dataset that could be used to train, to regularize or to evaluate deep learning-based facial recognition models. We propose to use a simple method for modeling and sampling a disentangled projection of a StyleGAN latent space to generate any combination of demographic groups (e.g. $hispanic-female$). Our experiments show that we can synthesis any combination of demographic groups effectively and the identities are different from the original traini",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，一些现代人脸识别系统被曝光出可能对特定人口群体进行歧视，并可能导致对性别和出身等各种面部属性的不公平关注。原因在于被用于训练这些模型的数据集中存在偏见和不平衡的人口统计数据。然而，采集一个各个人口统计数据都平衡的大规模数据集是不可行的。因此，本文探讨了一个替代方案，即生成一个具有平衡性和可能无偏见的合成数据集，以用于训练、正则化或评估基于深度学习的人脸识别模型。我们提出使用一个简单的方法来建模和采样一个StyleGAN潜空间的分解投影，以生成任意组合的人口群体（例如 $hispanic-female$）。我们的实验证明，我们可以有效地合成任意组合的人口群体，且这些身份与原始训练集中的身份不同。",
