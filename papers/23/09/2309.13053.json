    "translated_abstract": "在迅速增长的大型语言模型的教育背景下，本文探讨了中学教育所需的紧迫课程改革。以Madeline Grumet的课程研究三元框架为基础，研究界定了生成式人工智能与Elliot Eisner的显性、隐性和无实际目标课程概念之间的多维关系。研究审视了教育工作者在将这一新兴技术融入历史悠久的课程结构时所面临的物流和道德挑战，例如 AI 检测器的可靠性。通过接触Ted Aoki的“中间区域”理论，本文阐明了教育工作者在协调规定性课程目标与教室生活的变动真实性之间的困境，所有这些都发生在由于生成式人工智能持续变化的教育环境中。论文最后通过研究人员的反思分析，确定了时间表、教材的编写和教学方法的自主选择等主要问题，为将生成式人工智能引入学校提供了一些建议。",
