    "translated_abstract": "在学习物理系统的控制策略时，安全是一个必不可少的因素，因为在训练过程中违反安全约束可能导致昂贵的硬件损坏。为了满足这种需求，安全学习领域涌现出了一些算法，可以在不知道底层系统动态的情况下提供概率安全保证。这些算法通常依赖于高斯过程推理。然而，高斯过程推理的计算复杂度随着数据点数量的增加呈立方增长，限制了其在高维和嵌入式系统上的适用性。本文提出了一种安全学习算法，可以提供概率安全保证，并利用了Nadaraya-Watson估计器代替高斯过程。对于Nadaraya-Watson估计器，我们可以实现与数据点数量的对数比例的计算复杂度。我们为估计器提供了理论保证，将其嵌入到安全学习算法中，并在一个模拟的七自由度系统上进行了数值实验。",
