    "translated_abstract": "数据叙事在传达数据洞察力方面非常强大，但它需要人类创作者具备多样化的技能和相当大的工作量。最近的研究广泛探讨了人工智能支持和增强人类在数据叙事中的作用潜力。然而，缺乏一个系统性的综述来理解从人工智能协作的角度来看数据叙事工具，这阻碍了研究人员对现有的协作工具设计的思考，以促进人类和人工智能的优势并减少他们的不足。本文采用一个框架来研究现有工具，从两个角度来看：其服务于叙事工作流程的阶段，包括分析、规划、实施和沟通；以及在每个阶段人类和人工智能的角色，如创作者、助手、优化器和评审员。通过我们的分析，我们认识到现有工具中的共同协作模式，并总结了从这些模式中得到的经验教训。",
