    "translated_abstract": "认知逻辑程序（ELPs）在答案集编程（ASP）的基础上引入了认知运算符。这类程序的语义是通过世界观来提供的，世界观是一组信念集合，即句法上的原子集合的集合。不同的语义方法提出了不同的世界观刻画方式。最近的工作引入了一些对ELPs的语义满足的性质，例如认知分割性质，如果满足该性质，可以类似于传统的ASP以自下而上的方式模块化地计算世界观。我们分析了改变观察角度的可能性，从自下而上的分裂方法转向自上而下的方法。我们提出了一种基本的自上而下方法，并证明它与自下而上方法等价。然后我们提出了一种扩展的方法，其中我们的新定义：（i）可以证明适用于许多现有的语义；（ii）与“传统”的ASP类似地操作；（iii）在任何语义下都可以证明一致。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study focuses on Epistemic Logic Programs (ELPs), which extend Answer Set Programming (ASP) with epistemic operators. It introduces a bottom-up modularized computation method, similar to \"traditional\" ASP, by incorporating the concept of world views. The paper proposes an equivalent top-down approach that can be applied to various existing semantics, ensuring consistency in any semantic."
