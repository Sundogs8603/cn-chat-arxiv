    "translated_title": "评估虚拟资产服务提供商的偿付能力：当前的标准足够吗？",
    "translated_abstract": "像集中式加密货币交易所这样的实体属于虚拟资产服务提供商（VASP）的业务范畴。与其他企业一样，它们也可能破产。VASP促使在分布式账本技术（DLT）中以钱包形式组织的加密资产的交换、保管和转移。尽管DLT交易公开可见，但VASP的加密资产持有情况尚未受到系统化的审计程序的监管。本文提出了一种评估VASP偿付能力的方法，即通过交叉参考来自三个不同来源的数据：加密资产钱包、商业注册的资产负债表和监管机构的数据。我们调查了奥地利金融市场管理局注册的24个VASP，并提供了关于客户身份和来源的监管数据见解。他们每年的收入和支出交易量约为20亿欧元，涉及约180万用户。我们描述了金融服务提供者如何使用这些资产以及他们面临的挑战。",
