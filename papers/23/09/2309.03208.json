    "translated_abstract": "逻辑综合在芯片设计中起着重要作用，是半导体行业的基石。逻辑综合的关键任务是将由有向无环图（DAG）建模的电路转化为具有相同功能的简化电路。为了解决这个任务，许多逻辑综合操作符按顺序对输入DAG上每个节点根的子图应用变换。然而，我们发现大量的变换是无效的，导致应用这些操作符非常耗时。特别是，我们注意到Resub和Mfs2操作符的运行时间往往主导逻辑综合优化过程的整体运行时间。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的数据驱动逻辑综合操作符范式，称为PruneX，用于减少无效的变换。PruneX的主要挑战是学习适用于未见过电路（即超出分布范围）的模型，也即超领域泛化问题。因此，PruneX的主要技术贡献是实现了超领域泛化。",
