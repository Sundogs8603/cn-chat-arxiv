    "translated_abstract": "最近，线性计算机断层扫描（LCT）系统引起了人们的广泛关注。为了减弱LCT中的投影截断并对感兴趣区域（ROI）进行成像，反投影滤波（BPF）算法是一个有效的解决方案。然而，在LCT的BPF中，很难实现稳定的内部重建，并且对于LCT的不同反投影（DBP）图像，多个旋转有限反演的希尔伯特变换（希尔伯特滤波）-反转操作将使图像模糊。为了满足LCT的多种重建场景，包括内部ROI、完整对象和超出视野范围的外部区域，并避免希尔伯特滤波的旋转操作，我们提出了两种重建架构。第一种是叠加多个DBP图像以获得完整的DBP图像，然后使用网络学习叠加的希尔伯特滤波函数，称为叠加单一网络（OSNet）。第二种是使用多个网络训练不同的反投影重构器网络（MNetO）。",
