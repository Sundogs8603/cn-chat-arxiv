    "translated_abstract": "核磁共振(NMR)光谱学在化学和生物学中作为一种强大的分析工具，已经被广泛应用于研究分子结构和动力学。然而，对从NMR光谱仪获取的原始数据进行处理和后续定量分析涉及各种专门工具，这就需要全面掌握程序和NMR方面的知识。特别是，由于计算设置复杂，新兴的深度学习工具在NMR中的应用并不容易。因此，NMR处理对于化学家和生物学家来说并不是一项容易的任务。在这项工作中，我们提出了CloudBrain-NMR，一种智能在线云计算平台，用于NMR数据的读取，处理，重建和定量分析。该平台通过Web浏览器方便地访问，无需用户端安装任何程序。CloudBrain-NMR使用图形处理单元和中央处理单元进行并行计算，从而大大缩短了处理时间。",
