    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体平台通过使全球人民能够即时、公开和频繁地连接起来，改变了传统的沟通技术。人们使用社交媒体分享个人故事并表达自己的观点。负面情绪，比如死亡、自残和困难思维，在社交媒体上普遍存在，尤其是在年轻一代中。因此，利用社交媒体检测自杀思维将有助于提供适当的干预，最终阻止他人自残和自杀，并阻止自杀思维在社交媒体上的传播。为了研究自动检测阿拉伯推文中的自杀思维的能力，我们开发了一个新颖的阿拉伯语自杀推文数据集，使用词频和词嵌入特征训练了几种机器学习模型，包括朴素贝叶斯、支持向量机、KNN、随机森林和XGBoost，并研究了预训练深度学习模型的能力。",
