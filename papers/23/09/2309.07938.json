    "translated_abstract": "最近大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展，比如ChatGPT已广泛应用于各种软件工程任务中。许多论文已经报道了ChatGPT在编写代码、摘要、文本生成等方面的潜在优势和局限性的分析。然而，对于日志处理的ChatGPT的当前状态的分析却受到了很少的关注。大规模软件系统生成的日志复杂且难以理解。尽管复杂，但它们为主题专家提供了理解系统状态和诊断系统问题的关键信息。本文中，我们研究了ChatGPT在日志数据上执行几个有趣任务的当前能力，同时也试图找出其主要缺点。我们的发现表明，当前版本的ChatGPT在日志处理方面的性能有限，回复缺乏一致性且存在可扩展性问题。我们还对我们关于改进ChatGPT在日志处理中的观点进行了概述。",
