    "abstract": "With the emergence of generative artificial intelligence, an increasing number of individuals and organizations have begun exploring its potential to enhance productivity and improve product quality across various sectors. The field of education is no exception. However, it is vital to notice that artificial intelligence adoption in education dates back to the 1960s. In light of this historical context, this white paper serves as the inaugural piece in a four-part series that elucidates the role of AI in education. The series delves into topics such as its potential, successful applications, limitations, ethical considerations, and future trends. This initial article provides a comprehensive overview of the field, highlighting the recent developments within the generative artificial intelligence sphere.",
