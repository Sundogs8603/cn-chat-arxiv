    "translated_abstract": "本文引入了FourNet，一种新颖的单层前馈神经网络（FFNN）方法，用于逼近具有封闭形式的傅里叶变换（即特征函数）可用的过渡密度。FourNet的一个独特特点在于它使用了高斯激活函数，使得精确的傅里叶和逆傅里叶变换成为可能，并与高斯混合模型进行类比。我们从数学上证明了FourNet能够以任意精度逼近过渡密度，并仅使用有限数量的神经元。FourNet的参数通过最小化基于已知特征函数和FFNN的傅里叶变换的损失函数来学习，同时采用了策略性采样方法来增强训练。通过严密而全面的误差分析，我们推导出了$L_2$估计误差和估计密度中非负性的潜在（逐点）损失的信息界限。",
