    "translated_abstract": "从嘈杂和稀疏的部分点云中重建三维车辆对于自动驾驶具有重要意义。现有的大多数三维重建方法不能直接应用于这个问题，因为它们在处理带有微小噪声的密集输入时经过精心设计。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的框架，称为MV-DeepSDF，它从多次扫描的点云中估计最优的符号距离函数(SDF)表示，以重建野外车辆。尽管已经存在一些基于SDF的隐式建模方法，但它们只关注单视图的重建，导致重建质量较低。相反，我们首先分析了潜在特征空间中的多次扫描一致性和互补性，提出将隐式空间形状估计问题转化为元素到集合特征提取问题。然后，我们设计了一种新的架构来提取单独的元素级表示并将它们聚合起来生成一个集合级预测。",
