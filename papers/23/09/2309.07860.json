    "abstract": "Deep learning was recently successfully used in deriving symmetry transformations that preserve important physics quantities. Being completely agnostic, these techniques postpone the identification of the discovered symmetries to a later stage. In this letter we propose methods for examining and identifying the group-theoretic structure of such machine-learned symmetries. We design loss functions which probe the subalgebra structure either during the deep learning stage of symmetry discovery or in a subsequent post-processing stage. We illustrate the new methods with examples from the U(n) Lie group family, obtaining the respective subalgebra decompositions. As an application to particle physics, we demonstrate the identification of the residual symmetries after the spontaneous breaking of non-Abelian gauge symmetries like SU(3) and SU(5) which are commonly used in model building.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，深度学习成功地用于推导保持重要物理量不变的对称性变换。这些技术完全不考虑对已发现的对称性进行识别，将其推迟到后续阶段。在本文中，我们提出了一种检查和识别机器学习对称性的群论结构的方法。我们设计了损失函数，可以在对称性发现的深度学习阶段或后续后处理阶段探测子代数结构的方式。我们通过U(n)李群家族的例子说明了这些新方法，获得相应的子代数分解。作为粒子物理学的应用，我们展示了在非阿贝尔规范对称性如SU(3)和SU(5)自发破缺后识别残余对称性。",
