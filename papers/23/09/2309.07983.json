    "translated_abstract": "成员推断攻击允许对手确定一个特定示例是否包含在模型的训练数据集中。虽然先前的研究已经证实了在各种应用中进行此类攻击的可行性，但没有一个研究专注于说话人识别（SR），这是一种有前途的基于声音的生物特征识别技术。在这项工作中，我们提出了SLMIA-SR，这是第一个针对SR量身定制的成员推断攻击。与传统的示例级攻击不同，我们的攻击特点是说话人级别的成员推断，即确定给定推断声音中是否有任何给定说话人的声音，无论它们是否与给定推断声音相同。这在实践中非常有用，因为训练和推断声音通常是不同的，而且考虑到SR的开放性质，也是有意义的，即识别说话人往往没有出现在训练数据中。我们利用两个训练目标：内部接近度和外部远离度，来进行攻击。",
