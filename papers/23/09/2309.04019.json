    "abstract": "Gene set analysis is a mainstay of functional genomics, but it relies on manually curated databases of gene functions that are incomplete and unaware of biological context. Here we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's GPT-4, a Large Language Model (LLM), to develop hypotheses about common gene functions from its embedded biomedical knowledge. We created a GPT-4 pipeline to label gene sets with names that summarize their consensus functions, substantiated by analysis text and citations. Benchmarking against named gene sets in the Gene Ontology, GPT-4 generated very similar names in 50% of cases, while in most remaining cases it recovered the name of a more general concept. In gene sets discovered in 'omics data, GPT-4 names were more informative than gene set enrichment, with supporting statements and citations that largely verified in human review. The ability to rapidly synthesize common gene functions positions LLMs as valuable functional genomics assistants.",

    "translated_abstract": "基因集合分析是功能基因组学的重要方法，但它依赖于手动创建的基因功能数据库，这些数据库的不完整和不具备生物学上下文的特点。本文评估了OpenAI的GPT-4大型语言模型的能力，从其嵌入的生物医学知识中发展出有关常见基因功能的假设。我们创建了一个GPT-4流水线，用于用总结其共识功能的名称标记基因集合，并通过分析文本和引文进行证实。在与Gene Ontology中的具名基因集合进行基准测试时，GPT-4在50%的情况下生成了非常相似的名称，而在大多数其他情况下，则恢复了更一般概念的名称。在基因组学数据中发现的基因集合中，与基因集合富集相比，GPT-4的命名更具信息量，其支持性陈述和引文在人工审核中得到了基本验证。快速综合常见基因功能的能力使得大型语言模型成为有价值的功能基因组学助手。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study evaluates the ability of OpenAI's GPT-4 language model in discovering gene set functions and finds that it can generate names very similar to named gene sets in Gene Ontology based on its embedded biomedical knowledge. Moreover, in gene sets discovered from 'omics data, GPT-4's naming is more informative and validated by human review."
