    "translated_abstract": "针对乳腺X线摄影中集群微钙化的准确分割对于乳腺癌的诊断和治疗至关重要。尽管近期深度学习在医学图像分割方面取得了专家级准确性，但由于患者体位、个体腺体密度和乳腺X线摄影成像模式等方面的差异造成了领域转移，导致在实际应用中贡献有限。本文提出了一种名为MLN-net的新型框架，仅使用单一源图像即可准确地分割多源图像，用于集群微钙化分割。首先，我们提出了一种源域图像增强方法来生成多源图像，从而提高泛化性能。其次，采用了多层归一化（LN）层的结构来构建分割网络，在不同领域中对于集群微钙化分割具有良好效果。此外，还提出了一种支路选择策略来优化分割性能。",
