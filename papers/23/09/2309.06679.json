    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在利用模型和数据融合改进分离流体的雷诺平均纳维-斯托克斯解的Spalart-Allmaras（SA）闭合模型。特别是，我们的目标是开发模型，不仅能将稀疏的实验数据同化以改善计算模型的性能，还能通过恢复经典的SA行为来推广到未见过的情况。我们使用数据同化，即集合卡尔曼滤波方法（EnKF），通过将SA模型的系数校准到分离流体中来实现我们的目标。通过参数化产生、扩散和破坏项，实现了一种全面的校准策略。该校准依赖于采集的分离流体速度剖面、壁擦力和压力系数的实验数据的同化。尽管仅使用了来自单一流动条件（环绕一个背面台阶）的观测数据，但重新校准的SA模型表现出泛化能力。",
