In both scenarios, the samples appear in an online fashion and the goal is to test the properties of distribution using an optimal number of samples subject to a memory constraint on how many samples can be stored at a given time. First, we provide a trade-off between the sample complexity and the space complexity for testing identity when the samples are drawn according to the conditional access oracle. We then show that we can learn a succinct representation of a monotone distribution efficiently with a memory constraint on the number of samples that are stored that is almost optimal. We also show that the algorithm for monotone distributions can be extended to a larger class of decomposable distributions.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在有限内存条件下，标准访问模型和条件访问模型中的分布测试问题。在这两种场景中，样本以在线方式出现，目标是使用最优数量的样本在给定时间内存储的内存约束下测试分布的属性。首先，我们提供了在样本按条件访问预选的情况下，在样本复杂度和空间复杂度之间的折衷。然后，我们展示了我们可以有效地学习具有几乎最优样本数量的内存约束的单调分布的简洁表示。我们还展示了单调分布算法可以扩展到更大的可分解分布类。",

Trade-offs between sample complexity and space complexity are provided for both the standard access model and the conditional access model. Additionally, an efficient method for learning monotone distributions with optimal sample constraint is presented, and the algorithm is extended to a larger class of decomposable distributions."
