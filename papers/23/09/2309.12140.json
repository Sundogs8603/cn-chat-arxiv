    "abstract": "The rapid development of 3D object detection systems for self-driving cars has significantly improved accuracy. However, these systems struggle to generalize across diverse driving environments, which can lead to safety-critical failures in detecting traffic participants. To address this, we propose a method that utilizes unlabeled repeated traversals of multiple locations to adapt object detectors to new driving environments. By incorporating statistics computed from repeated LiDAR scans, we guide the adaptation process effectively. Our approach enhances LiDAR-based detection models using spatial quantized historical features and introduces a lightweight regression head to leverage the statistics for feature regularization. Additionally, we leverage the statistics for a novel self-training process to stabilize the training. The framework is detector model-agnostic and experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements, achieving up to a 20-point performance gain, ",

    "translated_abstract": "现如今，针对自动驾驶汽车的三维物体检测系统的快速发展极大提高了准确性。然而，这些系统往往难以泛化到多样化的驾驶环境中，这可能导致在检测交通参与者时发生安全关键性的失败。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种方法，利用无标签的多个位置重复遍历来适应物体检测器到新的驾驶环境。通过结合重复的激光雷达扫描计算的统计数据，我们有效地引导自适应过程。我们的方法通过使用空间量化的历史特征来增强基于激光雷达的检测模型，并引入了一个轻量级的回归头来利用统计数据进行特征正则化。此外，我们利用统计数据进行了一种新颖的自训练过程来稳定训练。该框架适用于任何检测器模型，并在现实世界数据集上进行的实验表明，取得了多达20个百分点的性能提升。",
