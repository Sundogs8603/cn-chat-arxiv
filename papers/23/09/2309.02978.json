    "translated_abstract": "在线健康社区是病人交流经验并提供心理支持的论坛。在在线健康社区中，社会支持对于帮助和康复病人起到至关重要的作用。然而，由于线上健康社区中的问题众多且病人访问具有随机性，很多病人的时效性问题往往没有得到回答。为了解决这个问题，我们迫切需要提出一个推荐系统，帮助问题提出者找到合适的问题解答者。然而，在线健康社区中开发一个增强社会支持的推荐算法仍是一个未被充分研究的领域。传统的推荐系统不能直接适用于这个问题，因为第一，与传统的推荐系统中的用户-物品链接不同，在线健康社区中的协助者-问题提出者链接很难建模，因为它们是基于各种异质的原因形成的。第二，很难区分历史行为和贡献对社会支持的影响。",
