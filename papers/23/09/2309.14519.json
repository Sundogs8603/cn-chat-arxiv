Prior research has shown great potential for the utilization of ChatGPT for academic purposes in revolutionizing the approach to studying across various disciplines. We investigate how ChatGPT performs across various question types in the GRE quantitative domain, and how modifying question prompts impacts its accuracy. More specifically this study addressed two research questions: 1. How does ChatGPT perform in answering GRE-based quantitative questions across various content areas? 2. How does the accuracy of ChatGPT vary with modifying the question prompts? The dataset consisting of 100 randomly selected GRE quantitative questions was collected from the ETS official guide to GRE test preparation. We used quantitative evaluation to answer our first research question, and t-test to examine the statistical association b",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了ChatGPT的问题解决能力以及其在标准化考试准备中的潜在应用，重点关注GRE定量考试。先前的研究已经显示了在各个学科的学习方法革命中，利用ChatGPT进行学术目的的巨大潜力。我们研究了ChatGPT在GRE定量领域不同类型问题上的表现，并且调整问题提示对其准确性的影响。具体地，本研究回答了两个研究问题：1. ChatGPT如何回答GRE基础定量题目在不同内容领域？2. 修改问题提示如何影响ChatGPT的准确性？数据集包含了100个从ETS官方GRE考试准备指南中随机选择的GRE定量问题。我们使用定量评估来回答我们的第一个研究问题，并使用t检验来检查统计关联。",
