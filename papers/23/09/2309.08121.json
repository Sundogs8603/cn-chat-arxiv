    "abstract": "Gender bias is rampant in AI systems, causing bad user experience, injustices, and mental harm to women. School curricula fail to educate AI creators on this topic, leaving them unprepared to mitigate gender bias in AI. In this paper, we designed hands-on tutorials to raise AI creators' awareness of gender bias in AI and enhance their knowledge of sources of gender bias and debiasing techniques. The tutorials were evaluated with 18 AI creators, including AI researchers, AI industrial practitioners (i.e., developers and product managers), and students who had learned AI. Their improved awareness and knowledge demonstrated the effectiveness of our tutorials, which have the potential to complement the insufficient AI gender bias education in CS/AI courses. Based on the findings, we synthesize design implications and a rubric to guide future research, education, and design efforts.",

    "translated_abstract": "性别偏见在AI系统中广泛存在，给女性用户带来了糟糕的体验，产生了不公正和心理上的伤害。学校教育未能给AI创作者提供关于这个主题的教育，使他们无法有效地减少AI中的性别偏见。本文针对AI创作者设计了实践教程，提高他们对AI中性别偏见的认识，并增强他们对性别偏见来源和去偏方法的知识。通过对18名AI创作者的评估，包括AI研究人员、AI工业从业者（开发人员和产品经理）和学习过AI的学生，我们证明了我们的教程的有效性，这些教程有望弥补CS/AI课程中不足的AI性别偏见教育。根据研究结果，我们综合了设计意义和评估指标，以指导未来研究、教育和设计工作。",
