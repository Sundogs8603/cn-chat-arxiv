We introduce AutoDRIVE Ecosystem as an enabler to develop physically accurate and graphically realistic digital twins of Nigel and F1TENTH, two scaled autonomous vehicle platforms with unique qualities and capabilities, and leverage this ecosystem to train and deploy multi-agent reinforcement learning policies. We first investigate an intersection traversal problem using a set of cooperative vehicles (Nigel) that share limited state information with each other in single as well as multi-agent learning settings using a common policy approach. We then investigate an adversarial head-to-head autonomous racing problem using a different set of vehicles (F1TENTH) in a multi-agent learning setting using an individual policy approach. In either set of experiments, a decentralized learning architecture was adopted",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一个模块化和可并行化的多智能体深度强化学习框架，用于在自主车辆中培养合作和竞争行为。我们引入了AutoDRIVE生态系统作为一个工具，开发出与真实的Nigel和F1TENTH两种比例自主车辆平台具有独特特性和能力的准确物理和逼真图形的数字孪生体，并利用这个生态系统来训练和部署多智能体强化学习策略。我们首先研究了一个交叉路口穿越问题，使用一组合作车辆（Nigel）在单个或多个智能体学习环境中共享有限状态信息，采用一种公共策略方法。然后我们研究了一个对抗性的头对头自主赛车问题，使用另一组车辆（F1TENTH）在多个智能体学习环境中采用个体策略方法。在任何一组实验中，都采用了分散学习架构。",
