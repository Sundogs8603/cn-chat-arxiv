    "translated_abstract": "深度学习（DL）特别是在MRI重建方面取得了图像保真度的提高和采集时间的减少。在神经成像中，DL方法可以从采样不足的数据中重建出高质量的图像。然而，考虑到民族特征，尤其是在DL算法中考虑公平性是至关重要的。本研究提出了一个基于DL的脑MRI重建模型的公平性分析。该模型利用U-Net架构进行图像重建，并通过实施基线经验风险最小化（ERM）和重新平衡策略来探索公平性的存在和来源。使用图像重建指标评估模型性能。我们的研究结果揭示了性别和年龄子组之间的统计学显著性能偏差。令人惊讶的是，数据不平衡和训练歧视不是偏见的主要来源。这项分析提供了关于DL图像重建中公平性的见解，并旨在改善公正性。",
