    "translated_abstract": "对于序列到序列的任务来说，将各个系统的输出进行组合是一项具有挑战性的工作。同时，解码准则与评估准则之间通常存在不匹配。最小贝叶斯风险（MBR）解码可以用于以更好地与最终评估准则对齐的方式组合系统的输出。本文研究了在语法错误修正（GEC）系统中的MBR解码，该系统通常以编辑次数和相关的F分数来评估性能。因此，我们提出了一种与这种准则直接相关的新颖MBR损失函数。此外，文中还描述了一种扩展候选句子集合的方法。该方法基于当前的最大投票组合方案，以及个体编辑级别的选择。在三个流行的GEC数据集和最先进的GEC系统上进行的实验证明了所提出的MBR方法的有效性。此外，论文还突出了MBR解码中不同奖励指标的变化对结果的影响。",
