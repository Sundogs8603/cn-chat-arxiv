    "translated_abstract": "光片荧光显微镜（LSFM）是一种平面照明技术，可以对样本进行高分辨率成像，但在光子通过厚组织时会出现光散射引起的图像模糊。为了解决这个问题，双视图成像是有帮助的。通过从相对方向观察样本，可以理想地扫描样本的各个部分。然而，最近的图像融合方法在比较两个视图的图像质量来确定焦点时，会产生空间不一致的焦点度量，因为它们的视野有限。在这里，我们提出了BigFUSE，一种全局上下文感知的图像融合器，通过考虑组织中光子传播的全局影响，并根据局部图像质量来确定焦点和模糊，从而稳定了LSFM中的图像融合。受到双视图LSFM中图像形成先验的启发，图像融合被视为使用贝叶斯定理估计焦点和模糊边界。",
