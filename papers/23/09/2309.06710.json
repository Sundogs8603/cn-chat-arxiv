    "translated_abstract": "尽管晶体结构预测是一个长期存在的挑战，我们介绍了ParetoCSP，这是一种用于晶体结构预测的新算法，它将多目标遗传算法（MOGA）与神经网络间原子势模型（IAP）结合起来，以找到给定化学成分的能量最优的晶体结构。我们通过将基因型年龄作为独立优化标准来增强NSGA-III算法，并采用M3GNet通用IAP来引导遗传算法的搜索。与GN-OA，一种基于神经势的晶体结构预测算法相比，ParetoCSP在55个不同的基准结构上通过七个性能指标的评估表明，具有显著更好的预测能力，优势因子为2.562。所有算法所遍历结构的轨迹分析表明，ParetoCSP产生了更多的有效结构，这有助于指导遗传算法更有效地搜索最优结构。",
