    "translated_abstract": "多变量时序（MTS）数据在各个应用领域都很重要。由于其序列性和多源性（多个传感器），MTS数据固有地展现了时空依赖性，包括时间戳之间的时间相关性和每个时间戳中传感器之间的空间相关性。为了有效利用这些信息，基于图神经网络的方法（GNNs）被广泛采用。然而，现有的方法分别捕获空间依赖性和时间依赖性，无法捕捉不同时间戳上不同传感器之间的相关性。忽视这样的相关性限制了在MTS数据中全面建模时空依赖性，从而限制了现有GNNs学习有效的表示。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一种新方法，称为全连接的时空图神经网络（FC-STGNN），包括两个关键组成部分，即FC图构建和FC图卷积。",
