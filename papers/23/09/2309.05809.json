    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络(DNNs)被越来越多地提出作为人类视觉模型，这得益于它们在图像分类和物体识别任务中的出色性能。然而，DNNs能否捕捉到人类视觉中诸如颜色感知等基本方面仍然不清楚。在这里，我们开展了新颖的实验证明了DNN中颜色嵌入的感知一致性，并评估了这些算法对通过在线调查收集的人类颜色相似性判断的预测能力。我们发现，包括卷积神经网络和视觉变换器在内的最先进DNN结构在对控制颜色特性的图像、在线搜索生成的图像以及经典的CIFAR-10数据集中真实世界图像的颜色相似性判断方面与人类颜色判断显著不同。我们将DNN性能与基于小波分解的可解释且符合认知的颜色感知模型进行了比较。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过对比深度神经网络(DNNs)和人类的颜色感知差异，发现最先进的DNN结构在颜色相似性判断方面与人类存在显著差异。这对于深入理解DNN在人类视觉方面的模拟能力具有重要意义。",
    "en_tdlr": "This research compares the color perception differences between deep neural networks (DNNs) and humans, and finds that state-of-the-art DNN architectures significantly diverge from human color judgments in terms of color similarity. This has important implications for understanding the ability of DNNs to simulate human vision."
