    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们提出了一个用于从科学文章中采集超导体实验数据的 SuperCon 数据库的分区平台。我们的目标是提高更新 SuperCon 的效率，同时保持或提高数据质量。我们介绍了一个由自动和手动过程组成的工作流驱动的半自动化分区平台，用于从提取的数据库中对数据进行校验和纠错。异常检测自动过程用于预先筛选采集到的数据。用户可以通过定制的用户界面在原始 PDF 文档上进行数据验证和纠错。此外，当记录被纠错时，其原始数据被收集并用于改进机器学习模型的训练数据。评估实验表明我们的分区平台显著提高了数据的管理质量。我们将界面与传统的手动阅读 PDF 文档并在 Excel 文档中记录信息的方法进行了比较。",
