    "translated_abstract": "海洋对人类活动产生了深远影响，并在气候调节中发挥着重要作用。随着卫星遥感数据的出现，我们对海洋的理解在过去几十年里得到了改善，使我们能够捕捉到全球必要的数量，例如海洋表面高度 (SSH)。然而，海洋卫星数据由于稀疏和不规则采样、信号复杂性和噪声等问题，对信息提取构成了挑战。机器学习 (ML) 技术在处理大规模、复杂信号方面展示了其能力。因此，我们认为 ML 模型有机会利用海洋卫星数据中包含的信息。然而，数据表示和相关评估指标可能是确定应用 ML 成功与否的关键因素。从原始观测数据到 ML 可用状态的处理步骤，以及从模型输出到可解释数量的处理步骤，都需要领域专业知识，这可能是对 ML 入门的重要障碍。",
