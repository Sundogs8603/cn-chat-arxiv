    "abstract": "Dynamic Ensemble Selection (DES) is a Multiple Classifier Systems (MCS) approach that aims to select an ensemble for each query sample during the selection phase. Even with the proposal of several DES approaches, no particular DES technique is the best choice for different problems. Thus, we hypothesize that selecting the best DES approach per query instance can lead to better accuracy. To evaluate this idea, we introduce the Post-Selection Dynamic Ensemble Selection (PS-DES) approach, a post-selection scheme that evaluates ensembles selected by several DES techniques using different metrics. Experimental results show that using accuracy as a metric to select the ensembles, PS-DES performs better than individual DES techniques. PS-DES source code is available in a GitHub repository",

    "translated_abstract": "动态集成选择（DES）是一种多分类器系统（MCS）方法，旨在在选择阶段为每个查询样本选择一个集成。尽管提出了几种DES方法的建议，但对于不同的问题，没有特定的DES技术是最佳选择。因此，我们假设选择每个查询示例的最佳DES方法可以提高准确性。为了评估这个想法，我们引入了后选择动态集成选择（PS-DES）方法，这是一种后选择方案，使用不同的度量指标评估由几种DES技术选择的集成。实验结果表明，使用准确性作为选择集成的指标，PS-DES的表现优于单个DES技术。PS-DES源代码可在GitHub存储库中获得。",
