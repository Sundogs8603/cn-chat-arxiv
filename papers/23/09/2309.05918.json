    "abstract": "In our opinion the exuberance surrounding the relative success of data-driven large language models (LLMs) is slightly misguided and for several reasons (i) LLMs cannot be relied upon for factual information since for LLMs all ingested text (factual or non-factual) was created equal; (ii) due to their subsymbolic na-ture, whatever 'knowledge' these models acquire about language will always be buried in billions of microfeatures (weights), none of which is meaningful on its own; and (iii) LLMs will often fail to make the correct inferences in several linguistic contexts (e.g., nominal compounds, copredication, quantifier scope ambi-guities, intensional contexts. Since we believe the relative success of data-driven large language models (LLMs) is not a reflection on the symbolic vs. subsymbol-ic debate but a reflection on applying the successful strategy of a bottom-up reverse engineering of language at scale, we suggest in this paper applying the effective bottom-up strategy in a symbol",

    "translated_abstract": "在我们看来，围绕数据驱动的大型语言模型（LLMs）相对成功的狂热是有些误导的，原因如下：（i）LLMs不能依赖于事实信息，因为对于LLMs来说，摄入的所有文本（事实或非事实）都是平等的；（ii）由于它们的亚符号性质，这些模型对语言的任何“知识”都将永远埋藏在数十亿个微特征（权重）中，其中没有一个本身是有意义的；以及（iii）LLMs在几种语言上下文中常常无法进行正确推理（如名词复合词、共谓词、量词范围模糊和意向性上下文）。我们相信，数据驱动的大型语言模型（LLMs）的相对成功不是符号与亚符号之辩的反映，而是在规模上应用自下而上的逆向工程语言的成功策略的反映。在本文中，我们建议将有效的自下而上策略应用于符号化方法中",
    "tldr": "随机LLMs无法理解语言的原因是它们无法提供可以依赖的事实信息，它们存储的语言知识埋藏在无意义的微特征中，并在某些语言上下文中无法进行正确推理。本文建议在符号化方法中应用有效的自下而上策略"
