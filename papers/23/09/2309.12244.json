ChaCha combines a state machine and large language models (LLMs) to keep the dialogue on track while carrying on free-form conversations. Through an exploratory study with 20 children (aged 8-12), we examine how ChaCha prompts children to share personal events and guides them to describe associated emotions. Participants perceived ChaCha as a close friend and shared their stories on various topics, such as family trips and personal achievements.

    "translated_abstract": "儿童通常通过与家人或他人分享故事和感受来学习辨识和表达情绪，然而，由于儿童正在发展他们的交流技能，父母或兄弟姐妹很难与他们进行情感沟通。本文介绍了ChaCha，一个鼓励和引导儿童分享个人事件和相关情绪的聊天机器人。ChaCha结合了状态机和大型语言模型（LLMs），在进行自由对话的同时保持对话的方向性。通过与20名年龄在8-12岁的儿童进行的探索性研究，我们研究了ChaCha如何促使儿童分享个人事件并引导他们描述相关情绪。参与者认为ChaCha就像一个亲密的朋友，并分享了各种主题的故事，如家庭旅行和个人成就。基于定量和定性发现，我们讨论了利用LLMs设计适合儿童的聊天机器人的机遇。",
