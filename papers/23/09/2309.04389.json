    "translated_abstract": "在最近几年，预训练语言模型（PLMs）取得了突破性进展，引起了相当多的研究关注，并在稠密段落检索方法上取得了有希望的性能，其目的是检索给定问题的相关段落。然而，大部分现有的数据集主要使用了通常常识的事实性查询来评估模型，而金融和经济等专业领域由于缺乏大规模的高质量数据集和专家注释而未被探索。在这项工作中，我们引入了一个新的任务，即政策检索，通过引入中国股票政策检索数据集（CSPRD），该数据集提供了由有经验的专家对来自我们收集的中国政策语料库中的10k+条目的相关文章进行标注的700+条招股说明书段落。对词汇、嵌入和经过微调的双编码模型的实验证明了我们所提出的CSPRD的有效性，但也提示了改进的丰富潜力。",
