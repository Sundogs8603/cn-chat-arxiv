    "abstract": "Markov processes are widely used mathematical models for describing dynamic systems in various fields. However, accurately simulating large-scale systems at long time scales is computationally expensive due to the short time steps required for accurate integration. In this paper, we introduce an inference process that maps complex systems into a simplified representational space and models large jumps in time. To achieve this, we propose Time-lagged Information Bottleneck (T-IB), a principled objective rooted in information theory, which aims to capture relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency information to simplify the simulation task and minimize the inference error. Our experiments demonstrate that T-IB learns information-optimal representations for accurately modeling the statistical properties and dynamics of the original process at a selected time lag, outperforming existing time-lagged dimensionality reduction methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "马尔可夫过程是描述各个领域中动态系统的广泛使用的数学模型。然而，由于需要准确积分的短时间步长，精确模拟长时间尺度上的大规模系统计算量很大。在本文中，我们引入了一种将复杂系统映射到简化表示空间并模拟时间上的大跳跃的推理过程。为了实现这一点，我们提出了基于信息理论的原则目标-时间滞后信息瓶颈（T-IB），它旨在捕捉相关的时间特征，同时丢弃高频信息以简化模拟任务并最小化推理误差。我们的实验证明，T-IB学习了信息最优的表示，能够准确地模拟原始过程在选择的时间滞后下的统计特性和动力学，并且优于现有的时间滞后降维方法。",
