In this work, we present NeMig, a bilingual news collection on the topic of migration, and corresponding rich user data.

    "translated_abstract": "新闻推荐通过过滤和传播关于不同主题的信息，对塑造公众世界观起着至关重要的作用。在今天的数字社会中，理解个性化推荐的影响已经变得至关重要，尤其是对于敏感话题。在这项工作中，我们介绍了NeMig，一份关于移民主题的双语新闻收集以及相应的丰富用户数据。相对于现有的新闻推荐数据集，NeMig涵盖了德国和美国发布的有关单一有争议话题的文章。我们注释了文章的情绪倾向以及媒体机构的政治倾向，并提取了通过Wikidata消歧义的子主题和命名实体。这些特征可以用来分析算法新闻推荐的影响，超过基于准确度的评估。",
