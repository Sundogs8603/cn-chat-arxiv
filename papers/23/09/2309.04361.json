    "translated_abstract": "随着电力质量在电力工业中的重要性日益提高，干扰事件数据的数量不断增长。电力公司没有足够的人员手动分析每个事件。本文提出了一种自动化方法，用于分析在电力传输系统内由数字故障录波器和电力质量监测仪记录的电力质量事件。该自动化方法利用基于规则的分析方法来检查电压和电流信号的时域和频域特征。可定制的阈值被设置用来对每个干扰事件进行分类。本文分析的事件包括各种故障、电动机起动和仪器互感器潜在故障。已经开发了14种不同事件类型的分析方法。对160个信号文件进行测试，准确率达到99％。采用一种称为循环直方图的方法对连续的、正常的信号数据进行分析。",
