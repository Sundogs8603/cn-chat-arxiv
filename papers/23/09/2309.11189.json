    "abstract": "Most modern ticketing systems rely on a first-come-first-serve or randomized allocation system to determine the allocation of tickets. Such systems has received considerable backlash in recent years due to its inequitable allotment and allocative inefficiency. We analyze a ticketing protocol based on a variation of the marginal price auction system. Users submit bids to the protocol based on their own utilities. The protocol awards tickets to the highest bidders and determines the final ticket price paid by all bidders using the lowest winning submitted bid. Game theoretic proof is provided to ensure the protocol more efficiently allocates the tickets to the bidders with the highest utilities. We also prove that the protocol extracts more economic rents for the event organizers and the non-optimality of ticket scalping under time-invariant bidder utilities.",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数现代售票系统依赖于先到先得或随机分配系统来确定票的分配。由于其不公平的分配和分配效率低下，这种系统近年来受到了相当大的批评。我们分析了一种基于边际价格拍卖系统变体的售票协议。用户根据自己的效用向协议提交投标。协议将票分配给出价最高的人，并使用最低的中标出价确定所有投标人支付的最终票价。我们提供了博弈理论证明，以确保该协议更有效地将票分配给效用最高的投标人。我们还证明了协议对活动组织者提取了更多的经济租金，以及在时间不变的投标人效用下，票务炒卖的非最优性。",
