    "abstract": "Social science often relies on surveys of households and individuals. Dozens of such surveys are regularly administered by the U.S. government. However, they field independent, unconnected samples with specialized questions, limiting research questions to those that can be answered by a single survey. The fusionACS project seeks to integrate data from multiple U.S. household surveys by statistically \"fusing\" variables from \"donor\" surveys onto American Community Survey (ACS) microdata. This results in an integrated microdataset of household attributes and well-being dimensions that can be analyzed to address research questions in ways that are not currently possible. The presented data comprise the fusion onto the ACS of select donor variables from the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) of 2015, the National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS) of 2017, the American Housing Survey (AHS) of 2019, and the Consumer Expenditure Survey - Interview (CEI) for the years 2015-2019.

    "translated_abstract": "社会科学常常依赖于家庭和个体的调查。美国政府经常进行数十个这样的调查。然而，它们是独立的、不相关的样本，并且有专门的问题，限制了只能通过一个调查来回答研究问题。fusionACS项目旨在通过统计学上将“供体”调查的变量与美国人社区调查 (ACS) 的微观数据进行“融合”，从而整合多个美国家庭调查的数据。这产生了一个综合的家庭属性和福祉维度的微数据集，可以用于分析研究问题，这是目前无法实现的。所呈现的数据包括对2015年住宅能源消费调查(RECS)、2017年全国家庭交通调查(NHTS)、2019年美国住房调查(AHS)和2015-2019年消费者支出调查-访谈(CEI)的选择供体变量进行融合到ACS的结果。",
