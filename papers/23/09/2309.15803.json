    "abstract": "Prostate cancer is a prevalent malignancy among men aged 50 and older. Current diagnostic methods primarily rely on blood tests, PSA:Prostate-Specific Antigen levels, and Digital Rectal Examinations (DRE). However, these methods suffer from a significant rate of false positive results. This study focuses on the development and validation of an intelligent mathematical model utilizing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to enhance the early detection of prostate cancer. The primary objective of this research paper is to present a novel mathematical model designed to aid in the early detection of prostate cancer, facilitating prompt intervention by healthcare professionals. The model's implementation demonstrates promising potential in reducing the incidence of false positives, thereby improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, we envision that, with further refinement, extensive testing, and validation, this model can evolve into a robust, marketable solution for prostate cancer detection. ",
