    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，通过将潜在空间的几何结构与底层数据结构对齐，可以提高机器学习模型的性能。研究人员提出使用具有恒定曲率的双曲和球形空间，或者它们的组合，来更好地建模潜在空间并增强模型性能，而不仅仅依赖于欧几里得空间。然而，目前对自动识别下游任务的最佳潜在几何结构问题还没有给予足够关注。我们在数学上定义了这个新颖的问题，并将其称为神经潜在几何搜索(NLGS)。具体而言，我们引入了一种基于格罗莫夫-豪斯多夫距离的候选潜在几何结构之间的新概念距离，以实现这一目标。为了计算格罗莫夫-豪斯多夫距离，我们提出了一种通过最小查询评估搜索由恒定曲率模型空间乘积组成的潜在几何结构的原则方法。",
