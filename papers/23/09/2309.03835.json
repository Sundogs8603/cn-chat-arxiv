    "translated_abstract": "示教学习（Learning for Demonstration，LfD）使得机器人可以通过模仿专家示范来获得新技能，允许用户以直观的方式传达他们的指示。最近在LfD领域的进展往往依赖于动作示范教学或远程操作作为用户指定示范的手段。动作示范教学需要对机器人进行物理操纵，而远程操作则需要熟练掌握额外的硬件。本文介绍了一种名为图示教学的LfD的替代范式。图示教学旨在通过要求用户在场景的二维图像上勾勒示范轨迹来教机器人新的技能，然后这些轨迹将被合成为三维任务空间中的运动轨迹的生成模型。此外，我们还提出了用于图示教学的射线追踪概率轨迹学习（RPTL）框架。RPTL从二维图示中提取时间变化的概率密度，并应用射线追踪来寻找相应的区域。",
