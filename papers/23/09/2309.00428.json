    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的基于局部性的学习方法来清理和求解光学运动捕捉数据。给定噪声标记数据，我们提出了一种新的异构图神经网络，将标记和关节视为不同类型的节点，并使用图卷积操作提取标记和关节的局部特征，并将其转化为清晰的动作。为了处理异常标记（例如遮挡或具有较大的跟踪误差），关键洞察力在于标记的动作与其直接相邻的标记的动作之间存在很强的相关性，但与其他标记的相关性较小，即局部性，这使得我们能够有效地填补缺失的标记（例如由于遮挡引起的）。此外，我们还通过研究加速度轮廓来识别由于跟踪错误引起的异常标记。最后，我们提出了一个基于表示学习和数据增强的训练机制，通过在具有屏蔽的数据上训练模型。屏蔽方案旨在模拟遮挡和噪声等情况。",

The proposed method uses graph convolution operations to extract local features and transform them into accurate motions. It addresses missing markers by leveraging the correlations between neighboring markers and identifies marker outliers caused by tracking errors.
