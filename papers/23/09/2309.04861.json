    "translated_abstract": "随着各种流媒体应用的出现，音乐流派分类变得越来越重要。如今，在一个复杂的音乐应用程序中，我们无法想象仅通过艺术家的名字和歌曲标题来搜索音乐。正确分类音乐一直很困难，因为与音乐相关的信息，如地区、艺术家、专辑或非专辑，是如此多变。本文提出了一项关于音乐流派分类的研究，使用了数字信号处理（DSP）和深度学习（DL）技术的组合。提出了一种新颖的算法，利用DSP和DL方法从音频信号中提取相关特征，并将其分类到各种流派中。该算法在GTZAN数据集上进行了测试，并取得了高精度。还提出了一种端到端的部署架构，用于集成到与音乐相关的应用程序中。对算法的性能进行了分析，并讨论了改进的未来方向。",
