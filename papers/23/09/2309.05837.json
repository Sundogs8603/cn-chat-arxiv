    "translated_abstract": "近年来，机器人自主领域取得了显著进展，并伴随着机器人技术的不断扩展。然而，新部署领域的出现给保证这些系统安全运行带来了前所未有的挑战，这仍然非常重要。传统的基于模型的安全控制方法在泛化性和可扩展性方面存在困难，新兴的数据驱动方法则往往缺乏明确的保证，这可能导致不可预测的灾难性故障。成功部署下一代自主机器人将需要整合两种范式的优势。本文提供了安全过滤器方法的综述，突出了现有技术之间的重要联系，并提出了一个统一的技术框架来理解、比较和结合它们。这个新的统一视图揭示了一系列看似不相关的安全过滤器类之间的共享模块结构，并自然地提出了进一步的研究方向。",
