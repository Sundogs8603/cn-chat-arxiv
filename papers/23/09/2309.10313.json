    "translated_abstract": "在GPT4的成功之后，多模态大规模语言模型（MLLM）研究引起了广泛关注。这一研究方向侧重于通过微调预训练的LLM和视觉模型来开发通用的LLM。然而，灾难性遗忘，即微调模型无法保持与预训练模型相似的性能水平，仍然是多模态LLM（MLLM）中的一个固有问题。本文介绍了EMT：用于评估MLLM中灾难性遗忘的评估方法，将每个MLLM作为一个图像分类器进行评估。我们首先应用EMT来评估几个开源的微调MLLM，并发现几乎所有评估的MLLM在标准图像分类任务上无法保持与他们的视觉编码器相同的性能水平。此外，我们继续微调LLaVA，一种MLLM，并利用EMT来评估整个微调过程中的性能。有趣的是，我们的结果表明，早期的微调阶段是关键的，过早停止微调可能导致低性能的模型。",
