    "translated_abstract": "交通标志检测是自动驾驶车辆操作中的关键任务，它确保了所有道路使用者的安全。当前基于深度神经网络的标志分类系统依赖像素级特征来检测交通标志，容易受到对抗性攻击的影响。这些攻击包括对标志的微小、难以察觉的改动，会导致传统分类器错误地识别标志。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于归纳逻辑编程的方法来检测自动驾驶车辆中的停车标志。该方法利用标志的高级特征，如形状、颜色和文本，来检测交通标志的类别。这种方法对抗对抗性攻击更加稳健，因为它模拟人类的感知方式，不容易受到当前深度神经网络分类器的限制影响。我们考虑了两种对抗攻击方法来评估我们的方法：鲁棒物理扰动（PR2）和对抗伪装（AdvCam）。",
