    "title": "Does My Dog ''Speak'' Like Me? The Acoustic Correlation between Pet Dogs and Their Human Owners. (arXiv:2309.13085v1 [cs.SD])",
    "abstract": "How hosts language influence their pets' vocalization is an interesting yet underexplored problem. This paper presents a preliminary investigation into the possible correlation between domestic dog vocal expressions and their human host's language environment. We first present a new dataset of Shiba Inu dog vocals from YouTube, which provides 7500 clean sound clips, including their contextual information of these vocals and their owner's speech clips with a carefully-designed data processing pipeline. The contextual information includes the scene category in which the vocal was recorded, the dog's location and activity. With a classification task and prominent factor analysis, we discover significant acoustic differences in the dog vocals from the two language environments. We further identify some acoustic features from dog vocalizations that are potentially correlated to their host language patterns.",

    "translated_abstract": "宿主语言对宠物的叫声产生影响是一个有趣但很少被探索的问题。本文首次对家狗叫声和它们人类宿主的语言环境之间可能存在的相关性进行了初步调查。我们首先提供了一个新的Shiba Inu狗叫声数据集，其中包括7500个干净的声音片段，还包括这些叫声的上下文信息和它们主人精心设计的数据处理流程中的语音片段。上下文信息包括录音时的场景类别、狗的位置和活动。通过分类任务和显著因素分析，我们发现了来自两种语言环境的狗叫声中的显著声学差异。我们进一步确定了一些可能与宠物主人的语言模式相关的狗叫声的声学特征。",
