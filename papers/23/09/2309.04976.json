    "translated_abstract": "减少由途中事件（例如路段关闭，车祸等）引起的意外城市交通拥堵通常需要快速准确地选择最合适的交通信号。传统的交通信号控制系统，如SCATS和SCOOT，由感应线圈提供的交通数据更新频率较低（即超过1分钟）。此外，这些系统使用的交通信号灯计划是事发前预先编程的候选计划的有限集合中选择的。最近的研究表明，由深度强化学习（DRL）算法控制的基于摄像机的交通信号系统在减少交通拥堵方面更加有效，摄像机可以提供高频高分辨率的交通数据。然而，由于道路基础设施需要过多的潜在升级，这些系统的部署成本在大城市中较高。在本文中，我们认为无人机（UAVs）可以在缓解意外的城市道路交通拥堵方面提供一种有效的解决方案。",
