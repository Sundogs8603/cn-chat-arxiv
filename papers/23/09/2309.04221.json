    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们引入了一种捕捉到了一个正测试需要多个“类型”项目的组合测试问题的变种。具体来说，我们假设存在多个不相交的“半缺陷集合”，并且只有包含每个集合中至少一个项目的测试结果才是正的。我们的目标是以尽可能少的测试来可靠地识别所有的半缺陷集合，我们将这个问题称为“同时进行的分组测试”(ConcGT)。我们针对这个任务推导出了各种算法，主要集中于存在两个半缺陷集合的情况。我们的算法有以下特点：(i)它们是确定性的(零错误)还是随机的(小错误)，(ii)它们是非自适应的、完全自适应的，还是有限自适应性的(例如，2或3个阶段)。我们的确定性自适应算法和我们的随机算法(非自适应或有限自适应性)在广泛的规模上都是最优的序列。",
