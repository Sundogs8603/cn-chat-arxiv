    "abstract": "Over the past decade, antibodies have steadily grown in therapeutic importance thanks to their high specificity and low risk of adverse effects compared to other drug modalities. While traditional antibody discovery is primarily wet lab driven, the rapid improvement of ML-based generative modeling has made in-silico approaches an increasingly viable route for discovery and engineering. To this end, we train an antibody-specific language model, AntiBARTy, based on BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer) and use its latent space to train a property-conditional diffusion model for guided IgG de novo design. As a test case, we show that we can effectively generate novel antibodies with improved in-silico solubility while maintaining antibody validity and controlling sequence diversity.",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年里，由于其高特异性和低不良反应风险，抗体在治疗中的重要性逐渐增加，与其他药物模式相比。尽管传统的抗体发现主要是湿实验驱动的，但基于机器学习的生成建模快速发展使得基于计算模拟的方法越来越可行。为此，我们训练了一个抗体特异性语言模型AntiBARTy，基于BART (双向和自回归变换器)，并使用其潜在空间训练了一个性质条件扩散模型，以指导IgG新生抗体的设计。作为一个测试案例，我们展示了我们能够有效地生成具有改进的无病毒溶解性的新型抗体，同时保持抗体的有效性和控制序列多样性。",
