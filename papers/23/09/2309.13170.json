    "abstract": "Over the past few years, deep learning has been getting progressively more popular for the exploitation of side-channel vulnerabilities in embedded cryptographic applications, as it offers advantages in terms of the amount of attack traces required for effective key recovery. A number of effective attacks using neural networks have already been published, but reducing their cost in terms of the amount of computing resources and data required is an ever-present goal, which we pursue in this work. We focus on the ANSSI Side-Channel Attack Database (ASCAD), and produce a JAX-based framework for deep-learning-based SCA, with which we reproduce a selection of previous results and build upon them in an attempt to improve their performance. We also investigate the effectiveness of various Transformer-based models.",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去几年中，深度学习在利用嵌入式密码应用中的侧信道漏洞方面越来越受欢迎，因为它在有效密钥恢复所需的攻击轨迹数量方面具有优势。已经发布了一些使用神经网络的有效攻击方法，但在计算资源和数据量方面减少其成本是一个永恒的目标，我们在这项工作中追求这个目标。我们专注于ANSI侧信道攻击数据库（ASCAD），并使用基于JAX的深度学习SCA框架，重现了一系列先前的结果并在此基础上改进性能。我们还研究了各种基于Transformer的模型的有效性。",
