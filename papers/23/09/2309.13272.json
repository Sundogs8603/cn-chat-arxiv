    "translated_abstract": "企业和研究长期以来一直希望能自动化尽可能多的软件开发和测试过程。在这个过程中，需求工程（RE）对于构建在其基础上的所有其他步骤起着重要作用。已经开发了基于模型的设计和测试方法来处理软件系统日益增长的复杂性和变异性。然而，仍需要大量工作来从以自然语言提供的大量功能需求中创建规范模型。文献中提出了许多基于自然语言处理（NLP）的方法来使用主要的句法属性生成需求模型。NLP的最新进展表明，也可以识别和使用语义量来在需求形式化过程中提供更好的帮助。在这项工作中，我们介绍和讨论了NLP领域的主要思想和最新方法论，以指导读者如何创建一个规范模型。",
