    "translated_abstract": "为了评估网络系统的风险，必须调查攻击者在成功入侵后的行为，这被称为后渗透。尽管有许多高效的工具支持后渗透实施，但没有应用程序能够自动化此过程。这个过程的大部分步骤由深入了解安全的专家完成，被称为渗透测试员或pen-testers。为此，我们的研究提出了Raij\\=u框架，一种强化学习（RL）驱动的自动化方法，可帮助pen-testers快速实施网络系统安全评估的后渗透过程。我们实现了两个RL算法，Advantage Actor-Critic（A2C）和Proximal Policy Optimization（PPO），来训练能够进行智能动作的专用代理，这些动作是Metasploit模块，用于自动发起特权升级、收集hashdump和横向移动的攻击。通过利用",
