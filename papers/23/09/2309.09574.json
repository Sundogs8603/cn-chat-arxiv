To address these challenges, this study presents a novel assimilation framework, termed Latent Assimilation with Implicit Neural Representations (LAINR). By introducing Spherical Implicit Neural Representations (SINR) along with a data-driven uncertainty estimator of the trained neural networks, LAINR enhances efficiency in assimilation process. Experimental results indicate that LAINR holds certain advantage over existing methods based on AutoEncoders, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",

    "translated_abstract": "数据同化在广泛的应用中至关重要，但常常面临挑战，如由于数据维度和对底层机制的不完全理解而导致的高计算成本。为解决这些挑战，本研究提出了一种新颖的同化框架，称为具有隐式神经表示的潜变同化（LAINR）。通过引入球面隐式神经表示（SINR）以及对训练的神经网络进行数据驱动的不确定性估计器，LAINR提高了同化过程的效率。实验结果表明，与基于自动编码器的现有方法相比，LAINR在准确性和效率方面具有一定优势。",
