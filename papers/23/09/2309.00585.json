In this paper, we present PolyGET, a new framework for Polymer Forcefields with Generalizable Equivariant Transformers. PolyGET is designed to capture complex quantum interactions between atoms and generalize across various polymer families, using a deep learning model called Equivariant Transformers.

    "translated_abstract": "聚合物模拟同时具备准确性和效率是一项具有挑战性的任务。已经开发了机器学习(ML)力场以实现原子论方法的准确性和经验力场的效率。然而，现有的ML力场通常仅限于单分子模拟，并且它们的模拟不够稳健。在本文中，我们提出了PolyGET，一个新的聚合物力场通用等变换器框架。PolyGET使用称为等变换器的深度学习模型来捕捉原子之间的复杂量子相互作用，并跨不同聚合物家族进行泛化。我们提出了一种新的训练范式，专注于优化力，与现有的同时优化能量和力的方法不同。这个简单的以力为中心的目标函数避免了能量和力之间的竞争目标，从而允许在不同的聚合物上学习统一的力场ML模型。",
