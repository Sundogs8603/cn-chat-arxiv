    "abstract": "We present a formal framework for the aggregation of financial markets mediated by arbitrage. Our main tool is to characterize markets via utility functions and to employ a one-to-one correspondence to limit order book states. Inspired by the theory of thermodynamics we argue that the arbitrage-mediated aggregation mechanism gives rise to a market-dynamical entropy, which quantifies the loss of liquidity caused by aggregation. We also discuss future directions of research in this emerging theory of market dynamics.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个通过套利介导的金融市场聚合的形式框架。我们的主要工具是通过效用函数来表征市场，并利用一对一的限价订单簿状态对应关系。受热力学理论的启发，我们认为套利介导的聚合机制引发了一个市场动力熵，该熵量化了聚合所导致的流动性损失。我们还讨论了这个新兴市场动态理论的未来研究方向。",
