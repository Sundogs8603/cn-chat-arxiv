    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了COMEDIAN，一种使用自监督学习和知识蒸馏初始化时空Transformer进行动作定位的新型流程。动作定位是一种基于时间戳级别的时间动作检测任务。我们的流程包括三个步骤，其中有两个初始化阶段。首先，我们使用短视频作为输入对空间Transformer进行自监督初始化。此外，我们还初始化一个时序Transformer，通过与每个短视频片段对齐的预计算特征库的知识蒸馏，增强空间Transformer的输出与全局上下文。最后一步，我们对Transformer进行微调以适应动作定位任务。在SoccerNet-v2数据集上进行的实验表明，COMEDIAN具有最先进的性能，并验证了其预训练模式的有效性。我们的结果突显了我们预训练流程的几个优点，包括改进的性能和更快的收敛速度。",
