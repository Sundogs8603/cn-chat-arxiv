    "translated_abstract": "类不平衡是许多实际分类任务中的一个主要问题。由于样本数量不平衡，支持向量机（SVM）分类器对多数类别有偏差。此外，这些样本通常存在一定程度的噪声。因此，为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的模糊方法来处理类不平衡和具有噪声的数据集。我们提出了两种方法来解决这些问题。第一种方法基于直觉模糊成员关系，称为鲁棒能量基模糊最小二乘双支持向量机（IF-RELSTSVM）。此外，在第二种方法中，我们引入了基于超平面的模糊成员关系的概念，其中最终分类器称为鲁棒能量基模糊最小二乘双支持向量机（F-RELSTSVM）。通过使用这种技术，成员关系值基于基于投影的方法，将数据点投影到超平面上。",
