Like humans, TTI models have a worldview, a conception of the world learned from their training data and task that influences the images they generate for a given prompt. However, the worldviews of TTI models are often hidden from users, making it challenging for users to build intuition about TTI outputs, and they are often misaligned with users' worldviews, resulting in output images that do not match user expectations. In response, we introduce DiffusionWorldViewer, an interactive interface that exposes a TTI model's worldview across output demographics and provides editing tools for aligning output images with user perspectives. In a user study with 18 diverse TTI users, we find that DiffusionWorldViewer helps users represent their varied viewpoints in generated images and challenge the limited worldview reflected in current TTI mod",

    "translated_abstract": "生成式文本到图像（TTI）模型可以从简短的文本描述中生成高质量图像，在学术和创意领域被广泛使用。与人类一样，TTI模型有一个世界观，即从训练数据和任务中学习到的对世界的认知，这会影响它们为给定提示生成的图像。然而，TTI模型的世界观通常对用户隐藏，这使用户难以建立对TTI输出的直觉，并且它们通常与用户的世界观不一致，导致输出的图像不符合用户的期望。为此，我们介绍了DiffusionWorldViewer，一个交互界面，可在输出的不同人口统计数据之间揭示TTI模型的世界观，并提供编辑工具以使输出图像与用户的观点一致。在对18位多样化TTI用户进行的用户研究中，我们发现DiffusionWorldViewer帮助用户在生成的图像中代表他们多样化的观点，并挑战当前TTI模型中反映的有限世界观。",
