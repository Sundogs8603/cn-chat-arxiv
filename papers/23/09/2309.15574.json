    "translated_abstract": "实现生态系统服务（ES）是社会实际利用ES的情况，与潜在ES相比，更直接关联到人类福祉。然而，目前缺乏一个通用的分析框架来理解实现了多少ES。在本研究中，我们首先提出了一个供给-需求-流动-利用（SDFU）的框架，将ES的供给、需求、流动和利用进行整合，并将这些概念区分为不同的方面（例如，潜在和实际的ES需求，供给的出口和进口流动等）。然后，我们将该框架应用于典型城市绿地公园中的三个ES的例子（即野生浆果供给，传粉和娱乐）。我们展示了该框架如何评估ES的实际利用情况，并识别出供给受限、需求受限和供需平衡类型的ES。我们还讨论了实现ES的尺度特征、时间动态和空间特征，以及未来研究中的一些关键问题。",
