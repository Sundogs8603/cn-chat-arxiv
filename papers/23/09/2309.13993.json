    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑从统计学中识别离散随机变量$X_1,\\ldots,X_n$的分布，该分布是$k$个乘积分布的混合物的问题。对于$n \\in O(k)$，以前的最佳样本复杂度为$(1/\\zeta)^{O(k^2 \\log k)}$（在由$\\zeta$参数化的轻微分离假设下）。已知最佳下界为$\\exp(\\Omega(k))$。已知$n\\geq 2k-1$对于识别是必要且充分的。我们展示了对于任意$n\\geq 2k-1$，如何实现样本复杂度和运行时复杂度$(1/\\zeta)^{O(k)}$。我们还将已知的下界$e^{\\Omega(k)}$扩展到了广泛范围的$\\zeta$匹配我们的上界。我们的结果通过组合（a）一种用于强大张量分解的经典方法和（b）通过仅研究它们在扁平化秩为1的张量上的作用来估计被称为Hadamard扩展的关键矩阵的条件数的一种新颖方法获得。",
