In addition, we conduct a thorough error analysis with current state-of-the-art algorithms and identify their limitations as well as the remaining challenges for the task of document-level IE. According to our findings, labeling noises, entity coreference resolution, and lack of reasoning, severely affect the performance of document-level IE.
