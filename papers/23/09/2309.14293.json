We introduce NAS-NeRF, a generative neural architecture search strategy that generates compact, scene-specialized NeRF architectures by balancing architecture complexity and target synthesis quality metrics.

    "translated_abstract": "神经辐射场（NeRF）实现了高质量的新视图合成，但其高计算复杂度限制了其可部署性。现有的基于神经网络的解决方案努力提高效率，但不考虑场景复杂性，使用通用架构。同一个架构可能对简单场景来说过于庞大，对复杂场景则不足够。因此，有必要动态优化NeRF的神经网络组件，以在计算复杂度和合成质量之间实现平衡。我们引入了NAS-NeRF，一种生成式神经体系结构搜索策略，通过平衡架构复杂度和目标合成质量指标生成紧凑、针对场景的NeRF架构。我们的方法结合目标度量和预算约束，指导搜索以获得适合每个场景的架构。在Blender合成数据集上进行的实验证明，提出的NAS-NeRF方法可以生成多达5个架构。",
