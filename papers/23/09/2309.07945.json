    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种用于掩码非自回归生成建模的新型采样方案。我们分析了TimeVQVAE、MaskGIT和Token-Critic在采样过程中的局限性，并提出了增强采样方案 (ESS) 来克服这些限制。ESS明确确保了样本的多样性和保真度，由三个阶段组成：简单迭代解码、关键反向采样和关键重采样。ESS首先使用MaskGIT中提出的简单迭代解码来采样一个标记集，以确保样本的多样性。然后，标记集经过关键反向采样，掩盖导致不真实样本的标记。在此之后，关键重采样重建被掩盖的标记，直到达到最终采样步骤以确保高度保真度。关键重采样使用来自自我Token-Critic获得的置信度分数更好地衡量采样标记的真实性，而关键反向采样使用量化潜变量空间的结构。",
