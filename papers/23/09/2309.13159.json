    "translated_abstract": "使用大规模信息和通信技术（ICT）数据集估计特定代理人的口味异质性需要模型的灵活性和计算效率。我们提出了一种基于群体级别的代理人混合（GLAM）logit方法，该方法使用逆优化（IO）和群体级别的市场份额进行估计。该模型在理论上与RUM模型框架一致，而估计方法是一种非参数方法，适用于市场级别的数据集，克服了现有方法的局限性。我们使用 Replica Inc. 提供的合成人口数据集进行了纽约州出行方式选择的案例研究，其中包括2019年秋季和2021年秋季两个典型工作日1953万名居民的出行方式选择。将个体出行方式选择按照人口普查区组OD对和四个人口段分组，得到120,740个群体级别的代理人。我们使用GLAM logit模型校准了该模型。",
