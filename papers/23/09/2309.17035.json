    "translated_abstract": "应用领域如数字人文学和聊天机器人等工具都涉及到对自然语言的处理，从数字化纸质文件到语音生成。内容的语言通常被划分为资源匮乏语言（LRL）或资源丰富语言（HRL）。非洲语言被认为是资源匮乏语言，而英语则是资源最丰富的语言。为了为这些语言开发软件系统以完成各种任务，使用了各种语言资源。本文认为对于所有语言来说，将其划分为LRL和HRL两种对立的类型是有问题的。通过对社会中语言资源的清晰理解，我们开发了一个矩阵来将语言划分为\"非常LRL\"、\"LRL\"、\"RL\"、\"HRL\"和\"非常HRL\"。这种划分基于连接情景基础设施、情景对话流、情景知识等的分类。",
    "tldr": "本文讨论了数字处理文本时，语言资源水平对其影响的上下文化分类，并提出了一个将语言划分为五个等级的矩阵，从而解决了将语言只划分为LRL和HRL两种类型的问题。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper discusses the contextualized classification of language resource levels that affect the digital processing of text, and proposes a matrix that categorizes languages into five levels, providing a solution to the problem of only classifying languages into LRL and HRL."
