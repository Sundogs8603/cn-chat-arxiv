    "abstract": "We present a machine learning (ML)-assisted framework bridging manifold learning, neural networks, Gaussian processes, and Equation-Free multiscale modeling, for (a) detecting tipping points in the emergent behavior of complex systems, and (b) characterizing probabilities of rare events (here, catastrophic shifts) near them. Our illustrative example is an event-driven, stochastic agent-based model (ABM) describing the mimetic behavior of traders in a simple financial market. Given high-dimensional spatiotemporal data -generated by the stochastic ABM -- we construct reduced-order models for the emergent dynamics at different scales: (a) mesoscopic Integro-Partial Differential Equations (IPDEs); and (b) mean-field-type Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) embedded in a low-dimensional latent space, targeted to the neighborhood of the tipping point. We contrast the uses of the different models and the effort involved in learning them.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个机器学习辅助的框架，将流形学习、神经网络、高斯过程和无方程多尺度建模相结合，用于检测复杂系统紧急行为的临界点，并描述与之相邻的罕见事件（例如灾难性变化）的概率特征。我们以一个基于事件驱动的随机代理模型（ABM）作为示例，描述一个简单金融市场中交易者的模拟行为。在高维时空数据（由随机ABM生成）的基础上，我们构建了不同尺度紧急动态的降阶模型：（a）中等尺度下的积分-偏微分方程（IPDEs）；以及（b）嵌入低维潜在空间的均场型随机微分方程（SDEs），针对临界点附近的领域。我们对不同模型的应用和学习过程的工作量进行了对比。",
