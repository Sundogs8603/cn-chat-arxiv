    "abstract": "Extracting information from r\\'esum\\'es is typically formulated as a two-stage problem, where the document is first segmented into sections and then each section is processed individually to extract the target entities. Instead, we cast the whole problem as sequence labeling in two levels -- lines and tokens -- and study model architectures for solving both tasks simultaneously. We build high-quality r\\'esum\\'e parsing corpora in English, French, Chinese, Spanish, German, Portuguese, and Swedish. Based on these corpora, we present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models for the information extraction task, outperforming approaches introduced in previous work. We conduct an ablation study of the proposed architectures. We also analyze both model performance and resource efficiency, and describe the trade-offs for model deployment in the context of a production environment.",

    "translated_abstract": "从简历中提取信息通常被形式化为一个两阶段的问题，即首先将文档分段，然后对每个段落进行单独处理以提取目标实体。我们将整个问题分为两个级别的序列标注任务，即行和标记，并研究了同时解决这两个任务的模型架构。我们构建了英语、法语、中文、西班牙语、德语、葡萄牙语和瑞典语的高质量简历解析语料库。基于这些语料库，我们提出了实验结果，证明了所提出模型在信息提取任务中的有效性，优于先前工作中的方法。我们对所提出的架构进行了消融研究。我们还分析了模型的性能和资源效率，并描述了在生产环境中进行模型部署时的权衡。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study formulates the problem of resume parsing as hierarchical sequence labeling, presenting models that simultaneously solve the tasks at the line and token levels. By creating high-quality resume parsing corpora in various languages, the proposed models demonstrate effectiveness in information extraction, outperforming previous approaches. An analysis of model performance and resource efficiency is conducted, providing insights into model deployment in production environments."
