    "translated_abstract": "神经时序点过程（TPPs）在建模连续时间事件序列方面显示出了潜力。然而，捕捉事件之间的相互作用对于执行预测等事件序列数据的推理任务是具有挑战性和关键性的。现有的TPP模型侧重于参数化未来事件的条件分布，但难以建模事件之间的相互作用。本文提出了一种新颖的方法，利用神经关系推理（NRI）来学习一个关系图，从观测数据中同时学习动态模式和推断相互作用。我们的方法，对比关系推理驱动的Hawkes过程（CRIHP），在变分推理框架下推理事件之间的相互作用。它利用基于强度的学习来搜索对比关系约束的原型路径。在三个真实世界数据集上进行的大量实验证明了我们模型在捕捉事件相互作用方面的有效性。",
