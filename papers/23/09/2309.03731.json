    "translated_abstract": "在医疗、商业、经济等领域，估计与治疗剂量相关的治疗效果（即“剂量反应”）非常重要。然而，这些连续值治疗效果通常是从观测数据中估计得到的，而观测数据可能存在剂量选择偏差，即剂量分配受到预处理协变量的影响。以前的研究表明，传统的机器学习方法在存在剂量选择偏差的情况下无法准确学习到个体治疗效果的估计。我们提出了一种名为CBRNet的因果机器学习方法，用于从观测数据中估计个体的剂量反应。CBRNet采用了Neyman-Rubin潜在结果框架，并扩展了平衡表示学习的概念，以克服连续值治疗中的选择偏差。我们的工作是第一个在连续值治疗中应用表示平衡的研究。",
