    "abstract": "The growing penetration of intermittent, renewable generation in US power grids, especially wind and solar generation, results in increased operational uncertainty. In that context, accurate forecasts are critical, especially for wind generation, which exhibits large variability and is historically harder to predict. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel Bundle-Predict-Reconcile (BPR) framework that integrates asset bundling, machine learning, and forecast reconciliation techniques. The BPR framework first learns an intermediate hierarchy level (the bundles), then predicts wind power at the asset, bundle, and fleet level, and finally reconciles all forecasts to ensure consistency. This approach effectively introduces an auxiliary learning task (predicting the bundle-level time series) to help the main learning tasks. The paper also introduces new asset-bundling criteria that capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of wind power time series. Extensive numerical experiments",

    "translated_abstract": "美国电网中间断性可再生能源的不断增加，特别是风能和太阳能发电，导致运营不确定性增加。在这种背景下，准确的预测非常重要，特别是对于风能发电，由于其变化幅度大且历史上难以预测。为了克服这一挑战，本研究提出了一种新颖的资产捆绑-预测-调整（BPR）框架，将资产捆绑、机器学习和预测协调技术相结合。BPR框架首先学习中间的层次结构（捆绑），然后预测资产、捆绑和整个风电场的风电功率，最后调整所有预测结果以确保一致性。这种方法有效地引入了一个辅助学习任务（预测捆绑层次的时间序列），以帮助主要的学习任务。本文还介绍了能够捕捉风电时间序列的时空动态的新的资产捆绑标准。进行了大量的数值实验。",
