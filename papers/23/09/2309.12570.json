    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）的发展使得其能够遵循指令并参与对话互动，引发了在各种支持工具中利用它们的兴趣增加。我们通过一项实证用户研究（n=30）探讨了现代LLM在协助专业作家方面的效用。我们的合作写作界面设计基于将写作视为一个目标导向的思维过程的认知过程模型，涵盖了非线性的认知活动：规划、翻译和审查。参与者被要求提交一份后完成调查，以提供关于LLM作为写作合作者潜力和问题的反馈。通过分析作家-LLM互动,我们发现作家在三种类型的认知活动中都寻求LLM的帮助，但他们发现LLM在翻译和审查方面更有帮助。通过分析互动和调查结果，我们的发现强调了未来研究的方向。",
