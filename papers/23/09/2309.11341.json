    "translated_abstract": "鉴于现有和新发布的文章数量庞大，将研究成果分类到特定上下文标签体系是一项具有挑战性和相关性的下游任务。我们提出了一种方法，通过使用边异构图表示来丰富简单的图神经网络（GNN）流水线，以提高文章分类的性能。我们使用SciBERT来生成节点特征，以捕捉文章的文本元数据中的高阶语义。我们在Open Graph Benchmark（OGB）ogbn-arxiv数据集和PubMed糖尿病数据集上进行了完全监督的传导式节点分类实验，分别通过Microsoft Academic Graph（MAG）和PubMed Central添加了附加元数据。结果表明，边异构图相对于边同构图，能够始终提高所有GNN模型的性能。转换后的数据使简单且浅层的GNN流水线能够与更复杂的架构相媲美的结果。",
