    "abstract": "Online innovation communities are an important source of innovation for many organizations. While contributions to such communities are typically made without financial compensation, these contributions are often governed by licenses such as Creative Commons that may prevent others from building upon and commercializing them. While this can diminish the usefulness of contributions, there is limited work analyzing what leads individuals to impose restrictions on the use of their work. In this paper, we examine innovators imposing restrictive licenses within the 3D-printable design community Thingiverse. Our analyses suggest that innovators are more likely to restrict commercialization of their contributions as their reputation increases and when reusing contributions created by others. These findings contribute to innovation communities and the growing literature on property rights in digital markets.",

    "translated_abstract": "在线创新社区是许多组织的重要创新来源。虽然对这些社区的贡献通常是无偿的，但这些贡献通常受Creative Commons等许可证的约束，可能阻止他人对其进行改进和商业化利用。尽管这可能减少了贡献的实用性，但目前还没有充分研究分析为什么个体会限制他们作品的使用。本文研究了3D打印设计社区Thingiverse中的创新者们对商业化的限制许可证。我们的分析表明，随着声誉的提高和对他人贡献的重复使用，创新者更倾向于限制对其贡献的商业化利用。这些发现对创新社区和数字市场产权的研究做出了贡献。",
