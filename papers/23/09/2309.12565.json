    "translated_abstract": "在线本地生活服务平台为数以亿计的用户提供附近的日常用品和食品配送等服务。与其他类型的推荐系统不同，本地生活服务推荐具有以下特点：（1）时空周期性，即用户对物品的偏好因不同位置和时间而异。（2）时空协同信号，即相似的用户在特定位置和时间具有相似的偏好。然而，大多数现有方法要么仅关注序列中的时空环境，要么在图中建模用户-物品交互，而没有考虑时空环境。为解决这个问题，我们在本文中设计了一种名为SPCS的新方法。具体而言，我们提出了一种新颖的时空图转换器（SGT）层，它明确地编码相对的时空环境，并从多跳邻居中聚合信息，以统一时空周期性和协同信号。",
