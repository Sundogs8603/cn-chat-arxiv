    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLMs）为形式化定理证明领域提供了一个有趣的探索途径。然而，它们的全部潜力，尤其是关于幻觉的减轻和通过证明器错误消息的细化，仍然是一个尚未深入研究的领域。为了增强LLMs在该领域的有效性，我们引入了Lyra，一种采用两种不同修正机制的新框架：工具修正（TC）和猜想修正（CC）。为了在形式证明的后处理中实现工具修正，我们利用先前的知识来利用预定义的证明工具（如Sledgehammer）来指导替换不正确的工具。工具修正显著减轻了幻觉，从而提高了证明的整体准确性。此外，我们引入了猜想修正，一种错误反馈机制，旨在与证明器互动，通过证明器的错误消息进一步完善形式证明的猜想。",
