    "translated_abstract": "检测问题内容，例如仇恨言论，是一项多方面且不断变化的任务，受社会动态、用户群体、信息来源的多样性和语言的演变影响。学术界和业界都进行了大量努力，开发出捕捉问题内容各个方面的注释资源。由于研究人员的不同目标，这些注释是不一致的，因此对于检测问题内容的进展报告是分散的。除非我们考虑问题的动态性，否则这种模式预计会持续存在。我们提出整合现有资源，并利用其动态特性打破这种模式。在本文中，我们引入了一个连续学习基准和框架，用于问题内容检测，包括来自8个来源的15个注释架构的84个相关任务。我们的基准创建了一种新的进展度量：优先考虑类别适应性。",
