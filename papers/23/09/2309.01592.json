Topics covered include various statistical and dynamical properties of these networks. In particular, the lecturers discuss properties of random deep neural networks; connections between trained deep neural networks, linear models, kernels, and Gaussian processes that arise in the infinite-width limit; and perturbative and non-perturbative treatments of large but finite-width networks, at initialization and after training.",

    "translated_abstract": "这些演讲是在2022年勒让夏季学校统计物理和机器学习课程上展示的，着重探讨了深度神经网络在无限宽度和大宽度范围内的情况。涵盖的主题包括这些网络的各种统计和动力学特性。特别是，讲师们讨论了随机深度神经网络的特性；训练过的深度神经网络，线性模型，核函数和高斯过程之间的联系，这些联系在无穷宽度的极限下出现；以及在初始化和训练后对大但有限宽度网络的摄动和非摄动处理。",
