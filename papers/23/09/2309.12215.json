    "translated_abstract": "广义可加模型 (GAMs) 是在各种应用中广泛使用的设计可解释模型。 GAMs假设输出可以表示为一组单变量函数的和，称为组件。然而，在输出依赖于多个特征同时的机器学习问题中，这种假设不成立。在这些情况下，GAMs无法捕捉到底层函数的交互项，导致准确性不佳。为了(部分)解决这个问题，我们提出了区域可加模型 (RAMs)，一种新颖的设计可解释模型。RAMs识别特征空间内的子区域，在这些子区域中最小化了特征的交互。在这些区域内，把输出表示为一组单变量函数 (组件) 相对于把输出表示为一个特征的单变量函数更加准确。因此，RAMs相比于GAMs拥有更丰富的模型表达能力，同时保持可解释性。RAM框架由三个步骤组成。",
