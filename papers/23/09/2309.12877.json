    "abstract": "How can we ensure that Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) research outcomes are both ethical and fair? While fairness in machine learning (ML) has gained traction in recent years, fairness in UbiComp remains unexplored. This workshop aims to discuss fairness in UbiComp research and its social, technical, and legal implications. From a social perspective, we will examine the relationship between fairness and UbiComp research and identify pathways to ensure that ubiquitous technologies do not cause harm or infringe on individual rights. From a technical perspective, we will initiate a discussion on data practices to develop bias mitigation approaches tailored to UbiComp research. From a legal perspective, we will examine how new policies shape our community's work and future research. We aim to foster a vibrant community centered around the topic of responsible UbiComp, while also charting a clear path for future research endeavours in this field.",

    "translated_title": "FairComp：关于普适计算中机器学习的公平性和鲁棒性研讨会",
    "translated_abstract": "我们如何确保普适计算（UbiComp）的研究成果既具有道德，又具有公平性？尽管机器学习中的公平性近年来引起了人们的关注，但在普适计算中的公平性仍未被探索。本次研讨会旨在讨论普适计算研究中的公平性及其社会、技术和法律影响。从社会角度来看，我们将研究公平性与普适计算研究之间的关系，并确定确保普适技术不会造成伤害或侵犯个人权利的途径。从技术角度出发，我们将发起关于数据实践的讨论，以开发适合普适计算研究的偏见消减方法。从法律角度来看，我们将研究新政策如何塑造我们社区的工作和未来研究。我们旨在建立一个关于负责任普适计算主题的充满活力的社区，同时为未来的研究努力在这一领域中规划出明确的路径。",
