    "translated_abstract": "最近提出的尾气排放标准旨在在美国显著增加电动汽车（EV）的销量。我们的研究考察了在EV矿物供应链存在潜在限制的情况下，是否能够实现这一增长。我们估计了一个模型，反映了国际采购规则、主要电池化学品的矿物质强度的异质性，以及长期的电网脱碳努力。我们的努力得出了五个关键发现。首先，要符合提议的标准，需要在2027年至2032年之间将至少1021万辆新的内燃机汽车替换为EV。其次，基于经济上可行和地质上可利用的矿产储量，制造足够的EVs在大多数电池化学品中是可行的，并且可以根据所采用的化学品减少高达4573万吨的CO2e。第三，美国及其盟友的矿产生产能力限制了在2027年至2032年之间总共生产509万个EV电池。",
