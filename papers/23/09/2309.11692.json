    "abstract": "News Discourse Profiling seeks to scrutinize the event-related role of each sentence in a news article and has been proven useful across various downstream applications. Specifically, within the context of a given news discourse, each sentence is assigned to a pre-defined category contingent upon its depiction of the news event structure. However, existing approaches suffer from an inadequacy of available human-annotated data, due to the laborious and time-intensive nature of generating discourse-level annotations. In this paper, we present a novel approach, denoted as Intra-document Contrastive Learning with Distillation (ICLD), for addressing the news discourse profiling task, capitalizing on its unique structural characteristics. Notably, we are the first to apply a semi-supervised methodology within this task paradigm, and evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the presented approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "新闻话语特征提取旨在审查新闻文章中每个句子的事件相关角色，并已在各种下游应用中证明其有用性。具体而言，在给定新闻话语的情境中，每个句子都被分配到一个预定义的类别，取决于其对新闻事件结构的描述。然而，由于生成话语级注释的繁琐和耗时性质，现有方法存在可用人工注释数据的不足。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖方法，称为内部文档对比学习与蒸馏（ICLD），用于解决新闻话语特征提取任务，利用其独特的结构特点。值得注意的是，我们是第一个在这个任务范式中应用半监督方法的研究，并且评估结果表明了该方法的有效性。",
