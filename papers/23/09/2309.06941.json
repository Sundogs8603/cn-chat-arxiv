    "translated_abstract": "低光图像增强的目标是恢复图像的颜色和细节，对于自动驾驶中的高级视觉任务非常重要。然而，仅依靠RGB领域很难恢复暗区域的丢失细节。本文将频率作为网络的新线索，并提出了一种新颖的DCT驱动增强Transformer（DEFormer）。首先，我们提出了一个可学习的频率分支（LFB）用于频率增强，包括DCT处理和基于曲率的频率增强（CFE）。CFE计算每个通道的曲率以表示不同频率带的细节丰富度，然后我们将频率特征划分为更丰富纹理的频率带。此外，我们提出了一个交叉域融合（CDF）来减少RGB领域和频率领域之间的差异。我们还将DEFormer作为暗部检测的预处理，DEFormer有效提高了性能。",
