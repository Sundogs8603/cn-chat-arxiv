    "translated_abstract": "在各个领域中，来自百度百科和维基百科等不同来源的数据通常呈现出不同的形式。目前的实体匹配方法主要集中在同质化数据上，其特点是属性具有相同的结构和简洁的属性值。然而，这种取向在处理具有多样化格式的数据时面临挑战。此外，目前的方法主要通过聚合相应属性之间的属性值相似度来确定实体相似度，但往往忽视了属性之间复杂的相互关系，其中一个属性可能具有多种关联。简单的逐对属性比较方法无法充分利用实体中所蕴含的丰富信息。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了一种新颖的实体匹配模型，称为基于BERT和神经网络捕捉复杂属性关系的实体匹配模型（EMM-CCAR），它构建在预训练模型的基础上。",
