    "translated_abstract": "随着全球老龄人口的增长，老弱群体的患病率预计将增加，给医疗系统带来重大挑战。老弱是一种与衰老相关的综合征，其特征是健康逐渐下降，对压力的脆弱性增加，死亡风险增加。老弱对公共卫生造成了重大负担，降低了患者生活质量。目前缺乏一种普遍接受的评估老弱程度的方法和标准化定义，这突显了一个关键的研究缺口。鉴于这一缺口和早期预防的重要性，本研究提出了一种创新方法，使用仪器化墨水笔对手写进行生态学评估，以对不同年龄群体进行分类。分析了来自80名不同年龄组（20-40岁、41-60岁、61-70岁和70+岁）的健康参与者的非图像手写数据。从原始数据中计算了14个与手势和震颤相关的指标，并在五个分类任务中使用了这些指标。",
