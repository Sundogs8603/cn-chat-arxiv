    "translated_abstract": "差分隐私（DP）是目前用于保护个人隐私的最先进的框架，可用于发布聚合统计数据或从数据中构建统计/机器学习模型。我们开发了开源的R包DPpack，提供了大量的差分隐私分析工具。当前版本的DPpack实现了三种常用的DP保护机制：拉普拉斯，高斯和指数。此外，DPpack还提供了一个易于访问的隐私保护描述性统计函数工具包。其中包括均值、方差、协方差和分位数，以及直方图和列联表。最后，DPpack提供了基于隐私保护的逻辑回归、支持向量机和线性回归的用户友好实现，以及针对每个模型的差分隐私超参数调整。这个大量实现的差分隐私统计和模型集合允许无麻烦地利用差异化。",
