    "translated_abstract": "图卷积网络（GCNs）已经在推荐系统中展示了有希望的结果，因为它们可以有效地利用高阶关系。然而，这些方法在真实场景中通常遇到数据稀疏问题。为了解决这个问题，基于GCN的推荐方法采用对比学习来引入自监督的信号。尽管这些方法有效，但它们缺乏对头和尾节点之间显著度差异的考虑。这可能导致非均匀的表示分布，这对于对比学习方法的性能是一个关键因素。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了一种新颖的用于推荐的长尾增强图对比学习（LAGCL）方法。具体而言，我们引入了一种可学习的长尾增强方法，通过补充预测的邻居信息来增强尾节点，并基于生成的增强图生成对比视图。为了使数据增强的程度平衡，我们还引入了一个度均衡机制。在实验中，我们在两个真实世界的推荐数据集上评估了LAGCL的性能，并与现有的对比学习方法进行了比较。",

A degree balancing mechanism is also employed to ensure balanced data augmentation. Performance evaluation on two real-world recommendation datasets shows the superiority of LAGCL compared to existing contrastive learning methods."
