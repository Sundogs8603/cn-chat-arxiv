    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在发展一个公平、负责任的人工智能框架，以推动能源互联网（IoE）。能源行业正面临两个重要的驱动因素：建设零碳能源行业和能源基础设施的数字化转型。我们预计这两个驱动因素的融合将实现能源互联网，通过利用先进的5G-6G网络和人工智能技术，将可再生分布式能源资源（如电动汽车、储能电池、风力涡轮和光伏发电）连接和集成，实现可靠的能源分配。这使得分布式能源资源的拥有者（即能源生产者和消费者）能够参与能源市场并获得经济激励。然而，分布式能源资源存在固有的资产驱动特征，并面临平等的挑战（即公平、多样和包容）。如果没有平等的获取机会，特权个体、群体和组织可能会以排斥其他人为代价参与和受益。",
