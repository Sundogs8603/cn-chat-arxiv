    "translated_abstract": "增长曲线模型是研究随时间在个体内部发展的响应变量的常用工具。这种模型中经常存在个体之间的异质性，研究者通常对解释或预测这种异质性感兴趣。我们展示了如何使用广义线性混合效应模型（GLMM）树来识别线性增长曲线模型中具有不同形状轨迹的子群。最初是针对聚类的横断面数据开发的GLMM树在这里被扩展到纵向数据。得到的扩展GLMM树可直接应用于增长曲线模型作为一个重要的特例。在模拟和真实数据中，我们评估了扩展的性能，并与其他用于增长曲线模型的分割方法进行了比较。扩展的GLMM树的性能比原始算法和LongCART更准确，并且与结构方程模型（SEM）树的准确性相似。此外，GLMM树可以对离散和连续的预测变量建模。",
