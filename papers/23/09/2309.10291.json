    "translated_abstract": "准确的长期预测是许多机器学习应用和决策过程的基础。然而，由于现有的时间模型（如循环神经网络）只能捕捉到训练数据中的统计关系，难以学习目标系统的潜在动力学，因此建立准确的长期预测模型仍然具有挑战性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于Koopman算子理论的新型机器学习模型，称为Koopman可逆自编码器（KIA），它在无穷维希尔伯特空间中建模了正向和反向动力学，从而能够有效地学习低维表示，实现对长期系统行为的更准确预测。此外，我们方法的可逆设计保证了正向和逆向操作的可逆性和一致性。我们通过实验表明，KIA在多个时间序列预测任务中具有优异的性能。",
