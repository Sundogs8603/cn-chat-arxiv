    "translated_abstract": "盲源分离（BSS）的任务是在没有先验知识的情况下从混合信号中分离出源信号和混合系统。这是一个具有挑战性的问题，通常需要对混合系统和源信号做出限制性的假设。本文提出了一种新颖的方法来解决非线性混合的BSS问题，该方法利用多编码器自编码器的自然特征子空间专门化能力，并通过完全自监督学习进行训练，而不需要强先验知识。在训练阶段，我们的方法将输入解码成多编码器网络的单独编码空间，然后在解码器内重新混合这些表示以重构输入。然后，为了进行源推断，我们引入了一种新颖的编码掩蔽技术，即屏蔽除一个编码外的所有编码，使得解码器能够估计源信号。为此，我们还引入了一种称为路径分离损失的方法，以促进编码之间的稀疏性。",
