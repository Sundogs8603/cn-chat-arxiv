    "translated_abstract": "尽管最近取得了一些进展，但使用现代生成模型编辑和操纵自然图像仍然具有挑战。在使用生成对抗网络（GAN）时，一个主要障碍在于将真实图像映射到其在潜在空间中对应的噪声向量的反向过程，因为需要能够重建图像才能编辑其内容。同样地，对于去噪扩散隐式模型（DDIM），每个反转步骤中的线性化假设使得整个确定性反转过程不可靠。现有的解决反转稳定性问题的方法通常在计算效率上产生显著的权衡。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种称为加速迭代扩散反转方法（AIDI）的方法，通过最小化额外的空间和时间复杂度开销显著提高重建精度。通过使用一种新颖的混合导向技术，我们展示了在广泛的图像范围上可以获得有效的结果。",
