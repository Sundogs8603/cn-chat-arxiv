    "translated_abstract": "尽管自然语言处理（NLP）取得了一些进展，但在修辞结构理论框架下的层级篇章解析仍然具有挑战性，对于这个原因的理解还很有限。在本文中，我们检查并建模了以前工作中与解析困难相关的一些因素：隐含的篇章关系的存在，识别长距离关系的挑战，词汇表外的项目等等。为了评估这些变量的相对重要性，我们还发布了两个带有显式正确和干扰性篇章标记的英文测试集，这些标记与黄金标准的RST关系相关。我们的结果表明，与浅层篇章解析一样，显式/隐式的区分起到了一定作用，但长距离依赖是主要挑战，而缺乏词汇重叠在至少针对特定领域的解析中不是一个大问题。我们的最终模型能够预测错误发生的位置，具有一个很高的准确率。",
