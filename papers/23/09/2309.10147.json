In this work, we argue that such impracticality issues are mainly due to the attacker's inability in collecting training data in comprehensive network conditions, e.g., a WF classifier may be trained only on samples collected on specific high-bandwidth network links but deployed on connections with different network conditions. We show that augmenting network traces can enhance the performance of WF classifiers in unobserved network conditions.

    "translated_abstract": "网站指纹识别（WF）被认为是对Tor用户（以及其他匿名系统）匿名性的主要威胁。尽管最先进的WF技术声称具有较高的攻击准确率，例如通过利用深度神经网络（DNN），但最近的几项研究对这些攻击的设计和评估中所做假设的实用性提出了质疑。在这项工作中，我们认为这些不切实际的问题主要是由于攻击者无法在全面的网络条件下收集训练数据引起的，例如，WF分类器可能只在特定高带宽网络链路上收集样本进行训练，但在具有不同网络条件的连接上部署。我们展示了通过增加网络跟踪可以提高在未观察到的网络条件下WF分类器的性能。具体而言，我们介绍了NetAugment，一种适用于Tor跟踪规范的增强技术。我们通过...",
