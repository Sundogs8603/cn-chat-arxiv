    "abstract": "The ability to conduct reproducible research in Stata is often limited by the lack of version control for user-submitted packages. This article introduces the require command, a tool designed to ensure Stata package dependencies are compatible across users and computer systems. Given a list of Stata packages, require verifies that each package is installed, checks for a minimum or exact version or package release date, and optionally installs the package if prompted by the researcher.",
