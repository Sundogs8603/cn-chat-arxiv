    "translated_abstract": "在科学和工程的许多领域中，计算期望相对于分布参数的梯度是一个问题。通常，这个问题使用Reinforce来解决，Reinforce将梯度估计问题视为Monte Carlo模拟。不幸的是，Reinforce估计器对真实概率分布和抽取样本之间的差异特别敏感，这是低抽样情况下常见的问题，导致梯度估计不准确。在本文中，我们引入了DBsurf，一种用于离散分布的Reinforce估计器，它使用一种新颖的抽样过程来减小样本和实际分布之间的差异。为了评估我们的估计器的性能，我们将其应用于多样的任务。在现有估计器中，DBsurf在文献中常用于基准测试的最小二乘问题中获得最低方差。此外，DBsurf也在最佳处理时间和质量之间取得了最佳的平衡。",
