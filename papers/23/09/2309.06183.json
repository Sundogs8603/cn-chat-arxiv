This large variability poses a major challenge for learning-based speech enhancement systems, since a mismatch between the training and testing conditions can substantially reduce the performance of the system. Generalization to unseen conditions is typically assessed by testing the system with a new speech, noise or binaural room impulse response (BRIR) database different from the one used during training.

    "translated_abstract": "噪声和混响语音混合物的声学变异性受多个因素影响，例如目标说话者和干扰噪声的频谱时域特性，信噪比和房间特性。这种大的变异性给基于学习的语音增强系统带来了很大的挑战，因为训练和测试条件之间的不匹配会大大降低系统的性能。通常通过使用与训练期间使用的不同的新语音、噪声或双耳房间脉冲响应（BRIR）数据库对系统进行测试来评估对未知条件的泛化能力。然而，语音增强任务的难度可能会随着数据库的变化而改变，这可能会对结果产生重大影响。本研究引入了一种泛化评估框架，该框架使用在测试条件下训练的参考模型作为测试条件难度的代理。",
