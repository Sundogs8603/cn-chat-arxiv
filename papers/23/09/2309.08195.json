    "translated_abstract": "火星白天侧广泛观察到质子极光，被认为是氢 Ly alpha (121.6 nm) 辐射在120至150公里高度之间的显著增强。太阳风质子作为高能中性原子穿过火星热层进入大气层，被认为是质子极光的原因。因此，理解质子极光对于描绘太阳风与火星大气相互作用至关重要。最近观测到局部\"斑块状\"质子极光，暗示在不稳定的太阳风条件下，质子可能直接沉积到火星大气中。在这里，我们利用火星大气和挥发物演化 (MAVEN) 非现场观测和边缘扫描的 Ly alpha 辐射资料开发了一个纯数据驱动模型来模拟质子极光。我们训练了一个人工神经网络，可以以0.95的Pearson相关性重现每个Ly alpha辐射的强度，并对观测结果进行忠实重构。",
