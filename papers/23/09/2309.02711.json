    "translated_abstract": "对称性是理解我们的环境的基本概念，但往往从数学的角度过于简化了现实。人类是个很好的例子，外貌和认知偏见（例如有一只占主导地位的手）都不完美地偏离了对称性。尽管如此，我们的大脑很容易克服这些不完美并高效地适应对称性任务。本研究的驱动动机在于通过强化学习捕捉这种能力。为此，我们引入了自适应对称学习（ASL）-一种模型最小化的演员-评论者扩展，通过在学习过程中自适应地解决不完全或不精确的对称描述。ASL包括一个对称拟合组件和一个模块化损失函数，它在所有状态中强制实施共同的对称关系，并适应了所学策略。将ASL的性能与现有的对称增强方法在一个涉及四足蚂蚁模型的案例研究中进行了比较。",
