    "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion is a task that revolves around filling in missing triples based on the information available in a knowledge graph. Among the current studies, text-based methods complete the task by utilizing textual descriptions of triples. However, this modeling approach may encounter limitations, particularly when the description fails to accurately and adequately express the intended meaning. To overcome these challenges, we propose the augmentation of data through two additional mechanisms. Firstly, we employ ChatGPT as an external knowledge base to generate coherent descriptions to bridge the semantic gap between the queries and answers. Secondly, we leverage inverse relations to create a symmetric graph, thereby creating extra labeling and providing supplementary information for link prediction. This approach offers additional insights into the relationships between entities. Through these efforts, we have observed significant improvements in knowledge graph completion",

    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱补全是一项基于知识图谱中可用信息填充缺失三元组的任务。在当前的研究中，基于文本的方法通过利用三元组的文本描述来完成任务。然而，这种建模方法可能遇到一些限制，尤其是当描述不能准确充分地表达预期含义时。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出了通过两个额外机制来增加数据的方法。首先，我们使用ChatGPT作为外部知识库，生成连贯的描述以弥补查询和答案之间的语义差距。其次，我们利用反向关系创建对称图，从而为链接预测提供额外的标签和补充信息。这种方法提供了关系实体之间额外的洞察力。通过这些努力，我们观察到了知识图谱补全方面的显著改进。",
