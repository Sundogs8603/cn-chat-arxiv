One process that that work has not engaged with much is alignment: the tuning of large language model (LLM) behavior to be in line with desired values based on fine-grained human feedback. In addition to other practices, colonialism has a history of altering the beliefs and values of colonized peoples; this history is recapitulated in current LLM alignment practices. We suggest that AI alignment be decolonialized using three proposals: (a) changing the base moral philosophy from Western philosophy to dharma, (b) permitting traditions of argument and pluralism in alignment technologies, and (c) expanding the epistemology of values beyond instructions or commandments given in natural language.",

    "translated_abstract": "先前的研究已经阐明了人工智能（AI）开发和部署的殖民性。然而，这些研究很少涉及到对齐：即基于细致的人类反馈，调整大型语言模型（LLM）的行为与期望值一致。除了其他实践，殖民主义还有一部分是改变被殖民民族的信仰和价值观的历史；而当前的LLM对齐实践正是这一历史的复制。我们建议通过三个提议对AI对齐进行去殖民化：（a）将基本道德哲学从西方哲学转变为达尔玛哲学，（b）在对齐技术中允许论证和多元主义的传统，以及（c）将价值的认识论扩展到超越自然语言中的指令或命令。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了去殖民化人工智能对齐的三个建议：改变基本道德哲学为达尔玛哲学，允许多元主义的论证传统存在于对齐技术中，以及将价值认识论扩展到超越自然语言中的指令。",
