    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a non-asymptotic local normal approximation for multinomial probabilities. First, we use it to find non-asymptotic total variation bounds between the measures induced by uniformly jittered multinomials and the multivariate normals with the same means and covariances. From the total variation bounds, we also derive a comparison of the cumulative distribution functions and quantile coupling inequalities between Pearson's chi-square statistic (written as the normalized quadratic form of a multinomial vector) and its multivariate normal analogue. We apply our results to find confidence intervals for the negative entropy of discrete distributions. Our method can be applied more generally to find confidence intervals for strictly convex functions of the weights of discrete distributions.",
