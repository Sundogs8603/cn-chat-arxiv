    "abstract": "The proliferation of fake news has become a significant concern in recent times due to its potential to spread misinformation and manipulate public opinion. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the detection of fake news in Brazilian Portuguese, focusing on journalistic-type news. We propose a machine learning-based approach that leverages natural language processing techniques, including TF-IDF and Word2Vec, to extract features from textual data. We evaluate the performance of various classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, AdaBoost, and LightGBM, on a dataset containing both true and fake news articles. The proposed approach achieves a high level of accuracy and F1-Score, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying fake news. Additionally, we develop a user-friendly web platform, FAKENEWSBR.COM, to facilitate the verification of news articles' veracity. Our platform provides real-time analysis, allowing users to ",
