    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习模型中，由于分布偏差，特别是在环境研究中的空间数据，对错误的估计通常是复杂的。我们引入了一种基于重要性采样思想的方法，以获得目标错误的无偏估计。通过考虑期望错误和可用数据之间的差异，我们的方法在每个样本点上重新加权错误并抵消偏移。我们使用重要性采样技术和核密度估计来进行重加权。我们使用类似真实世界空间数据集的人工数据验证了我们方法的有效性。我们的研究结果证明了我们提出的方法在目标错误估计方面的优势，并为分布偏移问题提供了解决方案。总体预测误差从7%降低到仅为2%，且随着样本量的增加而进一步降低。",

    "en_tdlr": "An approach based on importance reweighting is proposed to correct sampling biases in spatial modeling, addressing the challenge of distribution bias in machine learning models. The method successfully achieves an unbiased estimate of the target error by taking into account the difference between desirable error and available data. Through artificial data experiments, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach effectively reduces prediction error from 7% to 2%, with better performance for larger samples."
