    "translated_abstract": "目前在联邦学习环境中，没有学习方案利用可解释的人工智能（XAI）中的新学习度量，尤其是有助于确定模型学习情况的新学习度量。其中一种新的学习度量被称为“有效秩”（ER），它衡量矩阵奇异值的香农熵，从而确定层的映射效果。通过结合联邦学习和学习度量方法，本研究将(1)提供第一个联邦学习度量聚合方法，(2)证明有效秩适用于联邦问题，优于基准的联邦平均方法，(3)开发一种依赖有效秩的新型权重聚合方案。",
    "tldr": "本论文将联邦学习与学习度量方法相结合，提出了首个联邦学习度量聚合方法，并证明了有效秩适用于联邦问题，并通过开发新型权重聚合方案取得了优于基准的联邦平均效果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper combines federated learning with learning metrics, proposes the first aggregation method for federated learning metrics, demonstrates the suitability of effective rank for federated problems, and achieves better performance than the baseline Federated Averaging by developing a novel weight aggregation scheme based on effective rank."
