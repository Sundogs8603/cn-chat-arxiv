    "translated_abstract": "最近提出了基于机器学习的气候模型参数化方法，用于表示全球气候模型或湍流模拟中的子网格过程，这是一种强大的替代方案；相比于基于经验公式的传统方法，它具有更低的计算成本和更高的精度。然而，这些方法仍然存在泛化和外推能力不足的问题，而这对于气候变化的预测以及湍流的未观察到的态势是至关重要的。在这里，我们展示了一种多层次方法，该方法整合了不同准确性和丰富度的数据集，可以在两种方法之间提供最佳的结果：基于物理的参数化方法具备外推能力，并且基于机器学习的参数化方法具有更高的精度。在应用于气候建模的实验证明中，多层次方法能够提供更准确的气候预测，而无需大幅增加计算资源。",
