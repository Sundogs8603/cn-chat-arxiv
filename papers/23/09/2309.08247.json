    "abstract": "This paper presents the geometric aspect of the autoencoder framework, which, despite its importance, has been relatively less recognized. Given a set of high-dimensional data points that approximately lie on some lower-dimensional manifold, an autoencoder learns the \\textit{manifold} and its \\textit{coordinate chart}, simultaneously. This geometric perspective naturally raises inquiries like \"Does a finite set of data points correspond to a single manifold?\" or \"Is there only one coordinate chart that can represent the manifold?\". The responses to these questions are negative, implying that there are multiple solution autoencoders given a dataset. Consequently, they sometimes produce incorrect manifolds with severely distorted latent space representations. In this paper, we introduce recent geometric approaches that address these issues.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了自编码器框架的几何方面，尽管其重要性，但被相对较少地认识到。给定一组几乎位于某个较低维度流形上的高维数据点，自编码器同时学习流形和其坐标图。这种几何角度自然引发了一些问题，比如“有限的数据点对应于单一的流形吗？”或者“只有一个坐标图可以表示流形吗？”对这些问题的回答是否定的，这意味着给定一个数据集，有多个解的自编码器。因此，它们有时会产生具有严重畸变的潜在空间表示的错误流形。在本文中，我们介绍了解决这些问题的最近的几何方法。",
