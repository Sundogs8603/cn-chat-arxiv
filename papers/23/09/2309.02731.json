    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT因其出色的性能而引起了人们的广泛关注，但人们对其潜在风险，尤其是对AI生成内容（AIGC）的检测越来越关注，这对未经训练的人类来说往往很难识别。目前用于检测ChatGPT生成文本的数据集主要集中在问答方面，但往往忽视了具有语义不变性的任务，如摘要、翻译和改写。我们的研究表明，在语义不变任务上检测模型生成的文本更加困难。为了填补这一空白，我们引入了一个更广泛、更全面的数据集，考虑了比以前的工作更多类型的任务，包括语义不变任务。此外，经过大量任务指令微调的模型表现出很强的性能。基于以前的成功，我们进一步指导微调了Tk-instruct，并构建了一个更强大的模型。",

The corpus considers a wider range of tasks, including semantic-invariant tasks, compared to previous work. The study finds that detecting model-generated text on semantic-invariant tasks is more challenging. A more powerful model is built through extensive task instruction fine-tuning and Tk-instruct."
