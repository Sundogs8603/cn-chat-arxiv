Recently, existing CTTA methods mainly focus on utilizing a majority of parameters to fit target domain knowledge through self-training. Unfortunately, these approaches often amplify the challenge of error accumulation due to noisy pseudo-labels, and pose practical limitations stemming from the heavy computational costs associated with entire model updates.

    "translated_abstract": "由于自动驾驶系统通常面临动态和不断变化的环境，连续测试时适应（CTTA）被提出作为一种将部署模型转移到不断变化的目标域的策略。然而，追求长期适应往往会引入灾难性遗忘和误差累积问题，这些问题阻碍了CTTA在实际世界中的实施。最近，现有的CTTA方法主要集中于利用大部分参数通过自训练来适应目标领域知识。不幸的是，这些方法往往会由于嘈杂的伪标签而加剧误差累积的挑战，并由于整个模型更新所带来的沉重计算成本而带来实际限制。在本文中，我们提出了一种分布感知调整（DAT）方法，使得语义分割CTTA在真实应用中既高效又实用。",
