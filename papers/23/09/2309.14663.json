    "translated_abstract": "在研究机器人群体时，许多研究观察到复杂的群体行为是由个体智能体的简单局部动作产生的。然而，学习个体策略以产生所期望的新颖行为的任务仍然是一个具有挑战性且基本上未解决的问题。我们提出了一种训练分布式机器人群体算法以产生新颖行为的方法。受到动物中新颖行为的生物进化启发，我们使用进化算法训练一个“种群”中的个体行为来近似期望的群体行为。我们在使用CoppeliaSim模拟器进行的Georgia Tech Miniature Autonomous Blimps（GT-MABs）空中机器人平台模拟实验中进行了实验。此外，我们还在Anki Vector机器人的模拟中进行测试，以展示我们的算法在各种激励模式下的有效性。我们对需要一定复杂群体行为才能成功的各种任务进行了算法评估，其中包括一个区域C任务。",
