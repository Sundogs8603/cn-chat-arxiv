    "translated_abstract": "我们推导了深度神经网络(DNN)逼近$d$维风险资产期权价格的定量误差界限，这些界限与基础模型参数、支付参数和初始条件相关。我们涵盖了马尔可夫性质的广义随机波动性模型以及粗糙Bergomi模型。特别地，在适当假设下，我们证明了在DNN的网络规模仅次于资产向量维度$d$和精度的倒数$\\varepsilon^{-1}$时，期权价格可以被学习得到的误差可以任意小于一个小于1/2的误差$\\varepsilon$。因此，这种逼近不会受到维度灾难的影响。由于在我们的设置中，适用于DNN的定量逼近结果是基于紧致定义域上的函数，因此我们首先考虑了资产价格限制在紧致集合上的情况，然后再通过对期权价格的收敛性论证将这些结果推广到一般情况下。",
