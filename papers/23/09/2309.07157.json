    "translated_abstract": "配电网线路中断识别对于可持续的电网运行至关重要。本研究提出了一种实用而稳健的检测方法，只利用可用的电压幅值，消除了昂贵的相角或功率流数据的需求。针对传感器数据，许多现有的基于变点检测的检测方法需要对中断模式进行先验知识，而真实世界中的中断场景却是未知的。为了消除这种不切实际的要求，我们提出了一种数据驱动的方法，通过梯度下降来学习中断后分布的参数。然而，直接使用梯度下降存在可行性问题。为了解决这个问题，我们通过添加Bregman散度约束来修改我们的方法，以控制参数更新的轨迹，从而消除了可行性问题。如今，及时操作是关键，我们证明通过利用收敛保证可以学习到最优参数。",
