    "translated_abstract": "图像配准（IR）是一种将图像变形以使其相对于参考空间对齐的过程，使医务人员能够在标准化的参考框架中检查各种医学图像，如具有相同的旋转和缩放。本文以一个简单的数值示例介绍了图像配准，并提供了图像配准的定义以及空间方向的符号表示。本综述涵盖了各种图像变换的方面，包括仿射、可变形、可逆和双向变换，以及医学图像配准算法，如Voxelmorph、Demons、SyN、Iterative Closest Point和SynthMorph。还探讨了基于图谱的配准和多阶段图像配准技术，包括粗-细和金字塔方法。此外，本综述还讨论了医学图像配准的分类体系、数据集和评估指标，如基于相关性的度量和基于分割的度量。",
