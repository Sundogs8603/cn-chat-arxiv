    "translated_abstract": "IceCube中微子观测站是部署在南极冰中的一个立方千米级的高能中微子探测器。两个主要的事件类别是带电电子和带电μ中微子相互作用。在本文中，我们讨论了使用条件正态流对这些类别的方向和能量进行推断。它们允许基于原始数据对每个单独事件推导出一个后验分布，这些数据可能包括系统不确定性，这使得它们非常适用于下一代重构工作。对于每个正态流，我们使用微分熵和KL散度到其最大熵近似来解释结果。正态流正确地包含了南极冰的复杂光学特性及其与嵌入式探测器的关系。对于淋浴事件，微分熵在高光子吸收区域增加，在清晰冰中减少。对于μ子，微分熵与所包含的区域强相关。",
