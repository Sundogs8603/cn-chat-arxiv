    "abstract": "Generative adversarial network (GAN)-based vocoders have been intensively studied because they can synthesize high-fidelity audio waveforms faster than real-time. However, it has been reported that most GANs fail to obtain the optimal projection for discriminating between real and fake data in the feature space. In the literature, it has been demonstrated that slicing adversarial network (SAN), an improved GAN training framework that can find the optimal projection, is effective in the image generation task. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of SAN in the vocoding task. For this purpose, we propose a scheme to modify least-squares GAN, which most GAN-based vocoders adopt, so that their loss functions satisfy the requirements of SAN. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that SAN can improve the performance of GAN-based vocoders, including BigVGAN, with small modifications.

    "translated_abstract": "基于生成对抗网络（GAN）的声码器已经得到广泛研究，因为它们可以比实时更快地合成高保真音频波形。然而，已有研究报告发现大多数GAN在特征空间中无法获得区分真假数据的最佳投影。在文献中已经证明，切片对抗网络（SAN）作为一种改进的GAN训练框架，在图像生成任务中是有效的。本文中，我们研究了SAN在声码任务中的有效性。为此，我们提出了一种方案，修改了大多数基于GAN的声码器所采用的最小二乘GAN，使其损失函数满足SAN的要求。通过实验，我们证明了SAN可以通过小的修改改善包括BigVGAN在内的基于GAN的声码器的性能。我们的代码可在https://github.com/sony/bigvsan上获得。",
