For this reason, various room geometry inference (RGI) methods have been developed by utilizing the time of arrival (TOA) or time difference of arrival (TDOA) information in room impulse responses. However, the conventional RGI technique poses several assumptions, such as convex room shapes, the number of walls known in priori, and the visibility of first-order reflections. In this work, we introduce the deep neural network (DNN), RGI-Net, which can estimate room geometries without the aforementioned assumptions. RGI-Net learns and exploits complex relationships between high-order reflections in room impulse responses (RIRs) and, thus, can estimate room shapes even when the shape is non-convex or first-order reflections are missing in the RIRs.

    "translated_abstract": "房间几何是实现逼真的3D音频渲染的重要先验信息。为此，利用房间脉冲响应中到达时间（TOA）或到达时间差（TDOA）信息发展了各种房间几何推断（RGI）方法。然而，传统的RGI技术提出了一些假设，如凸房间形状、已知墙壁数量和一阶反射的可见性。在这项工作中，我们引入了深度神经网络（DNN）RGI-Net，它可以在没有上述假设的情况下估计房间几何。RGI-Net学习并利用房间脉冲响应（RIRs）中的高阶反射之间的复杂关系，因此可以在形状为非凸形或RIRs中缺少一阶反射的情况下估计房间形状。该网络采用从装有圆形麦克风的紧凑音频设备测量的RIRs。",
