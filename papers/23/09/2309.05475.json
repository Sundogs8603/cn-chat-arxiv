    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的研究关注从电子健康记录中的非结构化文本中研究人口统计学数据、社会决定因素和家族史，以了解如何利用这些信息与结构化数据相结合来改善医疗结果。在GPT模型发布后，许多研究应用GPT模型从临床记录中提取这些信息。与现有工作不同，我们的研究聚焦于通过对GPT模型提供最小信息来研究零-shot学习在提取这些信息方面的应用。我们利用匿名化的真实临床记录注释的人口统计学数据、各种社会决定因素和家族史信息。考虑到GPT模型可能提供与原始数据中的文本不同的文本，我们探索了两组评估指标，包括传统的命名实体识别评估指标和语义相似度评估指标，以完全了解性能情况。",
