    "abstract": "Reference-based metrics that operate at the sentence level typically outperform quality estimation metrics, which have access only to the source and system output. This is unsurprising, since references resolve ambiguities that may be present in the source. We investigate whether additional source context can effectively substitute for a reference. We present a metric, SLIDE (SLiding Document Evaluator), which operates on blocks of sentences using a window that slides over each document in the test set, feeding each chunk into an unmodified, off-the-shelf quality estimation model. We find that SLIDE obtains significantly higher pairwise system accuracy than its sentence-level baseline, in some cases even eliminating the gap with reference-base metrics. This suggests that source context may provide the same information as a human reference.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于参考的度量通常在句子级别上优于仅能访问源语言和系统输出的质量估计度量。这并不奇怪，因为参考能够消除源语言中可能存在的歧义。我们研究了是否可以用额外的源语言上下文有效地替代参考。我们提出了一种度量方法，SLIDE（SLiding Document Evaluator），它通过一个滑动窗口在每个测试集中的文档上操作，将每个块输入到未修改的现成质量估计模型中。我们发现，SLIDE在系统准确性的成对比较上较句子级别基线显著提高，有些情况下甚至消除了与参考度量之间的差距。这表明源语言上下文可能提供了与人类参考相同的信息。",
