    "translated_abstract": "数据中心中的硬盘故障是昂贵的 - 从灾难性的数据丢失到商业信誉的问题，利益相关者希望像瘟疫一样避免它。积极监测硬盘故障的重要工具是及时估计剩余寿命（RUL）。为此，硬盘驱动器内部使用的自我监测、分析和报告技术（S.M.A.R.T.）为这些重要数据存储设备的长期维护提供了关键的日志。过去的数据驱动预测模型经常使用这些S.M.A.R.T.日志和基于CNN/RNN的架构。然而，它们在提供预测的RUL值的置信区间以及处理非常长的日志序列方面遇到了重大困难。此外，一些使用LSTM等方法的研究在训练速度上很慢，并且需要繁琐的特征工程开销。为了克服这些挑战，在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的Transformer模型，其中包括了学习位置编码的双重方面。",
