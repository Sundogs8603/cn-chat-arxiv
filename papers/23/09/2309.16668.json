In this work, we propose RealFill, a novel generative approach for image completion that fills in missing regions of an image with the content that should have been there. RealFill is a generative inpainting model that is personalized using only a few reference images of a scene. These reference images do not have to be aligned with the target image, and can be taken with drastically varying viewpoints, lighting conditions, camera apertures, or image styles. Once personalized, RealFill is able to complete a target image with visually compelling contents that are faithful to the original scene. We evaluate RealFill on a new image completion benchmark that covers a set of diverse and challenging",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，生成图像的进展带来了能够在未知区域生成高质量、逼真图像内容的外拓和修填模型，但这些模型产生的内容是不真实的，因为模型缺乏关于真实场景的足够背景信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的真实图像修复生成方法RealFill，它通过填充图像中缺失区域使其内容真正应在的内容。RealFill是一种个性化的生成修填模型，仅使用几张目标场景的参考图像进行个性化。这些参考图像不需要与目标图像对齐，可以通过不同的视角、光照条件、摄像机光圈或图像风格拍摄。个性化后，RealFill能够以视觉上引人注目的内容完成目标图像，并且忠实于原始场景。我们在一个全面且具挑战性的图像修复基准上对RealFill进行评估。",
