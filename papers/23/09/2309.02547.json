    "translated_abstract": "机器人的操作任务，如物体重组，在使机器人能够与复杂和任意环境进行交互方面起着至关重要的作用。现有的工作主要集中在单层重组规划上，即使存在多个层次，子结构之间的依赖关系几何上也较简单，如塔式堆叠。我们提出了结构概念学习（SCL），这是一种利用图注意力网络进行多层次物体重组规划的深度学习方法，用直观的结构在自动生成的模拟数据集上训练，适用于具有结构依赖层次的未知场景，具有任意数量的对象和更复杂的结构，推断出独立的子结构，通过多个操纵器实现任务并行化，并且在现实世界中具有泛化能力。我们将我们的方法与一系列经典和基于模型的基准进行比较，以显示我们的方法利用了场景的理解能力。",
