    "abstract": "Automated game design (AGD), the study of automatically generating game rules, has a long history in technical games research. AGD approaches generally rely on approximations of human play, either objective functions or AI agents. Despite this, the majority of these approximators are static, meaning they do not reflect human player's ability to learn and improve in a game. In this paper, we investigate the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as an approximator for human play for rule generation. We recreate the classic AGD environment Mechanic Maker in Unity as a new, open-source rule generation framework. Our results demonstrate that RL produces distinct sets of rules from an A* agent baseline, which may be more usable by humans.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动游戏设计（AGD）是研究自动生成游戏规则的技术游戏研究的一个长期课题。 AGD方法通常依赖于对人类玩家游戏的近似，可以是客观函数或AI代理。尽管如此，大部分这些近似器是静态的，也就是说，它们不能反映人类玩家在游戏中的学习和提高能力。本文中，我们研究了将强化学习（RL）应用于生成规则的人类游戏评估中。我们在Unity中重新创建了经典的AGD环境Mechanic Maker作为一个全新的开源生成规则框架。我们的结果表明，RL与A*代理基线产生了不同的规则集，这些规则可能更适合人类使用。",
