    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种通过物理知识引导的机器学习方法，用于近似计算奇异摄动系统的慢不变流形，并提供了显式形式的函数来便于构建和数值积分缩减模型。该方案在几何奇异摄动理论框架下解决与不变方程（IE）对应的偏微分方程。为了解决IE，我们采用了两种神经网络结构，即前馈神经网络（FNNs）和随机投影神经网络（RPNNs），利用符号微分来计算学习过程所需的梯度。我们通过三个基准问题，即Michaelis-Menten反应机制、靶向介导的药物分布反应机制和3D Sel'kov模型，评估了我们的PIML方法的效率。结果表明，我们提出的PIML方案能够提供等价或甚至更高精度的近似解。",
