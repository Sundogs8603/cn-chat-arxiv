    "translated_abstract": "时间知识图（TKG）是传统知识图（KG）的扩展，融入了时间维度。在TKGs上进行推理是一个关键任务，旨在基于历史事件预测未来事实。关键挑战在于揭示历史子图和时间模式中的结构依赖关系。大多数现有方法依靠实体建模来模拟TKGs，因为图中的节点在知识表示中起着至关重要的作用。然而，现实场景通常涉及大量实体，并且随着时间的推移会出现新实体。这使得依赖于实体的方法很难应对大量实体，并且有效处理新出现的实体也成为一个重要的挑战。因此，我们提出了一种临时归纳路径神经网络（TiPNN），它以实体独立的角度对历史信息进行建模。具体而言，TiPNN采用了一个统一的图，名为历史时间图，来建模历史信息，并通过临时归纳路径提取结构和时间信息。",
