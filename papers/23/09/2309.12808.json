    "translated_abstract": "作为学习英语的常见方法，阅读理解主要包括阅读文章和回答相关问题。然而，设计有效练习的复杂性导致学生遇到标准化问题，使其难以与个体化学习者的阅读理解能力相匹配。本文利用大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）提供的先进能力，基于近发展区理论提出了一种新型个性化阅读理解辅助系统ChatPRCS。ChatPRCS采用阅读理解能力预测、问题生成、自动评估等方法，以增强阅读理解教学。首先，我们开发了一种新的算法，可以根据学习者的历史数据预测他们的阅读理解能力，为生成具有相应难度水平的问题奠定基础。其次，我们设计了一系列的阅读理解支持功能，如问题生成、自动评估等，来帮助学生进行个性化的阅读理解训练。",
