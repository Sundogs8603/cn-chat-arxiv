Maintaining a dataset of sampled individuals along with their actual fitness scores, we continually update throughout an evolutionary run a fitness-approximation ML model. We compare different methods for: 1) switching between actual and approximate fitness, 2) sampling the population, and 3) weighting the samples. Experimental findings demonstrate significant improvement in evolutionary runtimes, with fitness scores that are either identical or slightly lower than that of the fully run GA -- depending on the ratio of approximate-to-actual-fitness computation. Our approach is generic and can be easily applied to many different domains.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的方法，使用机器学习模型在遗传算法中进行适应度近似，重点是在Gymnasium（游戏）模拟器中的进化代理上 - 在这里适应度计算是昂贵的。我们维护一个采样个体及其实际适应度得分的数据集，并在整个进化过程中不断更新一个适应度近似的机器学习模型。我们比较了不同的方法：1）在实际适应度和近似适应度之间切换，2）对种群进行采样，以及3）加权采样样本。实验结果表明，在适应度计算的近似比例取决于完全运行GA时，我们的方法显著提高了进化运行时间，并且适应度得分要么与完全运行的GA相同，要么稍微低一点。我们的方法是通用的，可以很容易地应用于许多不同的领域。",
