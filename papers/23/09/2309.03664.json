    "abstract": "The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 19 subjects who received a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as of 5 pathological controls have been collected and analysed by Raman spectroscopy (RS). We investigated whether the raw and preprocessed Raman spectra could be used to distinguish AD from controls. First, we applied standard Machine Learning (ML) methods obtaining unsatisfactory results. Then, we applied ML to a set of topological descriptors extracted from raw spectra, achieving a very good classification accuracy (>87%). Although our results are preliminary, they indicate that RS and topological analysis together may provide an effective combination to confirm or disprove a clinical diagnosis of AD. The next steps will include enlarging the dataset of CSF samples to validate the proposed method better and, possibly, to understand if topological data analysis could support the characterization of AD subtypes.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究使用拉曼光谱分析了19名临床诊断为阿尔茨海默病（AD）和5名病理对照者的脑脊液（CSF）。我们研究了原始和预处理拉曼光谱是否可以用于区分AD和对照组。首先，我们应用常规机器学习方法得到了不理想的结果。然后，我们将机器学习应用于从原始光谱提取的拓扑描述符集合，实现了非常好的分类准确率（>87%）。虽然我们的结果是初步的，但它们表明拉曼光谱和拓扑分析的结合可能提供一种有效的方法来确认或否定AD的临床诊断。下一步将包括扩大CSF样本数据集以更好地验证所提出的方法，并可能了解拓扑数据分析是否能支持AD亚型的表征。",
