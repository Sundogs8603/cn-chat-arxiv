    "translated_abstract": "在今天的全球互联中，移居国外变得越来越普遍，无论是为了就业、难民安置还是其他原因。母语与移民之间的语言障碍是日常生活中的常见问题，特别是在医疗领域。这可能导致患者和医生在病史采集或急诊室的沟通过程中出现困难，从而影响患者护理。HYKIST项目的目标是开发一个语音翻译系统，以支持患者与医生之间的沟通，其中包括自动语音识别（ASR）和机器翻译（MT）技术。尽管近年来ASR系统在某些特定任务上表现出色，例如LibriSpeech，但由于讲话风格、声学和录音设置的多样性以及缺乏特定领域的训练数据，构建一个良好的模型仍然较为困难。本论文描述了我们在医疗领域的电话对话语音识别任务中构建ASR系统的努力。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study aims to provide support for the construction of Vietnamese automatic speech recognition system in the HYKIST project through unsupervised pre-training. This will help address the language barrier between patients and doctors in the medical field, and improve the quality of patient care."
