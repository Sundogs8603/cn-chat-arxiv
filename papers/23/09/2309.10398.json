    "translated_abstract": "临床决策支持系统是帮助临床医生进行医疗决策的软件工具。然而，临床医生对这些系统的接受程度通常较低。已知的问题是它们通常需要临床医生手动输入大量病人数据，而这一过程既冗长又繁琐。现有的解决方案，如从电子健康记录中自动提取数据，尚未完全满足要求，因为数据质量和可用性较低。实际上，许多系统仍然包括需要填写长问卷的数据输入方式。本文提出了一种简化病人数据输入的创新解决方案，使用适应性问卷，即在用户交互过程中动态显示或隐藏问题的问卷。针对基于规则的决策支持系统，我们设计了将系统的临床规则转化为显示规则的方法，以确定在问卷中显示的项目，并设计了确定项目优先顺序的方法。",
