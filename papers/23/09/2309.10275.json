    "translated_abstract": "在拥挤环境中进行的多智能体路径规划是一个具有挑战性的运动规划问题，旨在为系统中的所有智能体找到无碰撞路径。多智能体路径规划在各个领域中都有广泛的应用，包括空中群体、自动化仓储机器人和自动驾驶车辆。当前的多智能体路径规划方法可以大致分为两种主要类别：集中式规划和分散式规划。集中式规划受到维度灾难的困扰，因此在大型和复杂环境中不具备良好的可扩展性。另一方面，分散式规划使智能体能够在部分可观察环境中进行实时路径规划，展示了隐式的协调能力。然而，在密集环境中它们的收敛速度较慢且性能下降。本文介绍了一种名为CRAMP的众包感知分散式方法，通过增强式课程引导的强化学习来解决这个问题。",
