    "abstract": "Hypothesis formulation and testing are central to empirical research. A strong hypothesis is a best guess based on existing evidence and informed by a comprehensive view of relevant literature. However, with exponential increase in the number of scientific articles published annually, manual aggregation and synthesis of evidence related to a given hypothesis is a challenge. Our work explores the ability of current large language models (LLMs) to discern evidence in support or refute of specific hypotheses based on the text of scientific abstracts. We share a novel dataset for the task of scientific hypothesis evidencing using community-driven annotations of studies in the social sciences. We compare the performance of LLMs to several state-of-the-art benchmarks and highlight opportunities for future research in this area.

    "translated_abstract": "假设的制定和测试是经验性研究的核心。一个强有力的假设是基于现有证据的最佳猜测，并且是基于相关文献的全面视图进行启发的。然而，随着每年科学文章数量的指数增长，对于给定假设相关证据的手动汇总和综合是一项挑战。我们的工作探索了当前大型语言模型（LLMs）根据科学摘要文本中的证据，能否辨别支持或反驳特定假设的能力。我们共享了一个新颖的数据集，用于社会科学中使用社区驱动的研究注释的科学假设证据任务。我们将LLMs的性能与几个最先进的基准进行比较，并指出未来研究的机会。该数据集可在https://github.com/Sai90000/ScientificHypothesisEvidencing.git上获得。",
