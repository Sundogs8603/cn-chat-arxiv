    "translated_abstract": "由于外观变化、干扰物和点云的高稀疏性，点云中的3D单物体跟踪仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。值得注意的是，在自动驾驶场景中，目标物体通常在连续帧中保持空间邻近性，主要水平移动。这种空间连续性为目标定位提供了宝贵的先验知识。然而，现有的跟踪器通常采用点级表示，难以有效利用这种知识，因为这种表示的不规则格式。因此，它们需要精心设计并解决多个子任务来建立空间对应关系。在本文中，我们介绍BEVTrack，一个简单但强大的用于3D单物体跟踪的基线框架。通过将连续的点云转换为常见的鸟瞰图表示，BEVTrack通过简单的逐元素操作自然地编码了空间邻近性，并灵活地捕捉了跟踪的运动线索。",
