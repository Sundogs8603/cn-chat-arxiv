    "title": "Developing automatic verbatim transcripts for international multilingual meetings: an end-to-end solution. (arXiv:2309.15609v1 [cs.CL])",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an end-to-end solution for the creation of fully automated conference meeting transcripts and their machine translations into various languages. This tool has been developed at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) using in-house developed speech-to-text (S2T) and machine translation (MT) components. Beyond describing data collection and fine-tuning, resulting in a highly customized and robust system, this paper describes the architecture and evolution of the technical components as well as highlights the business impact and benefits from the user side. We also point out particular challenges in the evolution and adoption of the system and how the new approach created a new product and replaced existing established workflows in conference management documentation.",
