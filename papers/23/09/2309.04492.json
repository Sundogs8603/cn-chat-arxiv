    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了非仿射控制系统的安全关键控制问题。通过使用控制屏障函数（CBFs），已经证明优化二次成本在状态和控制约束下可以通过一系列二次规划（QPs）来进行次优化。我们最近提出的高阶CBFs（HOCBFs）可以容纳任意相对阶数的约束。该方法的主要挑战是需要仿射控制动态以及CBF-based QP的解决方案是点解法，因此是次优解。为了解决这些挑战，我们将高阶CBFs整合到基于神经常微分方程的学习模型中，作为可微的CBFs，以确保非仿射控制系统的安全性。可微的CBFs可以通过它们的参数进行训练，因此可以解决CBFs过度保守的问题，使系统状态不必要地远离安全边界。",
