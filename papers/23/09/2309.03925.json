    "translated_abstract": "最近注意力机制的多实例学习（MIL）的进展提高了我们对数字病理学中模型依赖的组织区域进行预测的洞察力。然而，这些方法的可解释性仍然有限。特别是，它们没有报告高注意力区域与类标签的正向或负向关联，以及这些区域与先前建立的临床和生物学知识的对应程度。我们通过引入一种后训练方法来分析MIL模型来解决这个问题。首先，我们通过结合细化编码器产生的瓦片级别的注意力和预测得分，引入了预测-注意力加权（PAW）地图，从而能够量化高注意力区域的预测贡献。其次，我们通过将PAW地图与细胞核分割掩模集成起来，引入了一种生物特征实例化技术。这进一步提高了可解释性，提供了与生物意义相关的特征。",
