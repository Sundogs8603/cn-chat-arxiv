    "translated_abstract": "当前加密货币自动化市场制造商的方法导致严重的临时性损失和碎片化流动性。我们专注于开发和分析多代币主动型市场制造商(MPMM)。MPMM是DODO Exchange引入的主动型市场制造商(PMM)的扩展，它泛化了常数乘积市场制造商(CPMM)，允许调整定价曲线的“平坦度”和平衡点。我们分析了PMM和MPMM中使用的这些机制，并通过模拟证明MPMM在资本效率和价格影响方面明显优于其2代币池对应物和它们的多代币池泛化。此外，在典型的市场条件下，MPMM也比其他市场制造商变体更有效地应对临时性损失。总的来说，这项研究突显了多代币市场制造商相对于成对代币模型的优势，并提出了一种新的市场制造算法。研究结果提供了有价值的参考。",
