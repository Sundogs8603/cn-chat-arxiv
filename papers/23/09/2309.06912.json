    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络(GNNs)广泛应用于推荐系统领域，为用户提供个性化推荐并取得显著成果。最近，融入对比学习的GNNs在处理推荐系统的稀疏数据问题方面表现出了很大的潜力。然而，现有的对比学习方法在解决冷启动问题和抵抗噪声干扰方面仍然存在限制，尤其是对于多行为推荐。为了缓解上述问题，本研究提出了一种基于GNNs的多行为推荐模型MB-SVD，利用奇异值分解(SVD)图来提高模型性能。具体而言，MB-SVD考虑了用户在不同行为下的偏好，改善了推荐效果，同时更好地解决了冷启动问题。我们的模型引入了一种创新的方法论，将多行为对比学习范式融入到模型中，以提高模型的性能。",
