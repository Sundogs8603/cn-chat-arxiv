    "abstract": "With the increasing deployment of deep neural networks in safety-critical applications such as self-driving cars, medical imaging, anomaly detection, etc., adversarial robustness has become a crucial concern in the reliability of these networks in real-world scenarios. A plethora of works based on adversarial training and regularization-based techniques have been proposed to make these deep networks robust against adversarial attacks. However, these methods require either retraining models or training them from scratch, making them infeasible to defend pre-trained models when access to training data is restricted. To address this problem, we propose a test time Data-free Adversarial Defense (DAD) containing detection and correction frameworks.

    "translated_abstract": "随着深度神经网络在诸如自动驾驶汽车、医学影像、异常检测等安全关键应用中的日益部署，对抗鲁棒性已成为这些网络在实际场景中可靠性的关键问题。许多基于对抗训练和正则化技术的工作已被提出，以使这些深度网络对抗攻击具有鲁棒性。然而，这些方法要求重新训练模型或从头开始训练，使得在训练数据访问受限的情况下保护预训练模型变得不可行。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个包含检测和修正框架的测试时无数据对抗防御方法（DAD）。此外，为了在检测器置信度不足时进一步提高修正框架的有效性，我们提出了一种软检测方案（称为\"DAD++\"）。我们在几个数据集上进行了广泛的实验和消融分析。",
