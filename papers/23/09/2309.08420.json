    "translated_abstract": "近年来，利用来自多个领域的用户序列数据的跨领域顺序推荐(CSR)受到了广泛关注。然而，现有的CSR方法需要在领域之间共享原始用户数据，这违反了《通用数据保护条例》(GDPR)。因此，有必要将联邦学习(FL)和CSR相结合，充分利用不同领域的知识，同时保护数据隐私。然而，不同领域之间的序列特征异质性对FL的整体性能有显著影响。在本文中，我们提出了FedDCSR，这是一种通过解缠表示学习的新型联邦跨领域顺序推荐框架。具体而言，为了解决不同领域之间的序列特征异质性，我们引入了一种称为领域内-领域间序列表示解缠(SRD)的方法，将用户序列特征解缠成领域共享和领域专属特征。",
