    "translated_abstract": "帕金森病与大脑衰老速度加快有关。性别被认为是帕金森病的一个重要因素，男性患病的可能性是女性的两倍，且症状更严重，进展更快。尽管以前的研究已经有所进展，但对帕金森病患者中性别在大脑衰老过程中的功能理解仍存在显著差距。本研究使用基于T1加权MRI的大脑预测年龄差异，在PPMI数据库的373名帕金森病患者中使用经过训练的鲁棒大脑年龄估计框架进行计算，该框架在949名健康受试者上进行了训练。使用线性回归模型研究了帕金森病中大脑预测年龄差异与临床变量之间的关联，按性别分层。所有女性帕金森病患者都参与了相关性分析，而相同数量的男性根据年龄、教育水平、症状发病年龄和临床症状严重程度使用倾向评分匹配方法进行了筛选。尽管两组患者的人口统计学参数相匹配，动作的演变却因性别而有所不同。",

By analyzing the predicted age difference of the brain in 373 Parkinson's disease patients and stratifying by sex, it was found that gender differences can lead to variations in symptoms and progression rate of Parkinson's disease."
