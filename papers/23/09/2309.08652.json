In previous work Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were employed to demonstrate the generation of plausible correlation matrices, that capture the essential characteristics observed in empirical correlation matrices estimated on asset returns. Instead of GANs, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAE) to achieve a more interpretable latent space representation. Through our analysis, we reveal that the VAE latent space can be a useful tool to capture the crucial factors impacting portfolio diversification, particularly in relation to credit portfolio sensitivity to asset correlations changes.",
