As different users incorporate suggestions from the same model, there is a risk of decreased diversity in the produced content, potentially limiting diverse perspectives in public discourse. In this work, we measure the impact of co-writing on diversity via a controlled experiment, where users write argumentative essays in three setups -- using a base LLM (GPT3), a feedback-tuned LLM (InstructGPT), and writing without model help. We develop a set of diversity metrics and find that writing with InstructGPT (but not the GPT3) results in a statistically significant reduction in diversity. Specifically, it increases the similarity between the writings of different authors and reduces the overall lexical and content diversity. We additionally find that this effect is mainly attributable to InstructGPT contributing less diverse text to co-writt",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）引发了与模型辅助合作写作的激增。当不同用户纳入同一模型的建议时，会存在内容多样性减少的风险，可能限制公共话语中的多元观点。本研究通过控制实验测量了协同写作对多样性的影响，在该实验中，用户以三种设置撰写议论性文章--使用基本LLM（GPT3）、经过反馈调整的LLM（InstructGPT）以及不使用模型帮助写作。我们开发了一组多样性指标，并发现使用InstructGPT进行写作（而不是GPT3）会导致多样性明显降低。具体而言，它增加了不同作者的写作之间的相似性，减少了整体的词汇和内容多样性。此外，我们还发现这种影响主要来源于InstructGPT对共同撰写的文本贡献较少。",
