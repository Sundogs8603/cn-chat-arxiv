    "abstract": "Understanding the intention of vehicles in the surrounding traffic is crucial for an autonomous vehicle to successfully accomplish its driving tasks in complex traffic scenarios such as highway forced merging. In this paper, we consider a behavioral model that incorporates both social behaviors and personal objectives of the interacting drivers. Leveraging this model, we develop a receding-horizon control-based decision-making strategy, that estimates online the other drivers' intentions using Bayesian filtering and incorporates predictions of nearby vehicles' behaviors under uncertain intentions. The effectiveness of the proposed decision-making strategy is demonstrated and evaluated based on simulation studies in comparison with a game theoretic controller and a real-world traffic dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "在复杂的交通场景中，如高速公路被迫合并，了解周围交通车辆的意图对于自动驾驶车辆成功完成驾驶任务至关重要。本文提出了一种行为模型，将交互驾驶员的社会行为和个人目标相结合。利用该模型，我们开发了一种基于递进时间窗控制的决策策略，利用贝叶斯滤波估计其他驾驶员的意图，并在不确定意图下预测附近车辆的行为。通过与博弈理论控制器和真实交通数据集的比较，展示并评估了所提决策策略的有效性。",
