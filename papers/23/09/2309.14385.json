    "translated_abstract": "可解释人工智能（XAI）模型近年来引起了各个应用领域的广泛兴趣。尽管在这个领域取得了显著进展，但目前仍缺乏标准化的方法或途径来理解人工智能模型的输出。为了弥合这一差距，一个系统和有凝聚力的框架已经越来越必要，以整合新的技术，如判别模型和生成模型。本文通过提出一个基于新颖框架的经验评估，即采样 - 变分自编码器（VAE） - 集成异常检测（SVEAD），为XAI的讨论做出了贡献。该框架是一个混合架构，其中VAE与集成堆叠和SHapley可加性解释（SHAP）用于不平衡分类。研究结果表明，集成堆叠、VAE和SHAP的结合不仅可以提高模型性能，而且提供了一个易于解释的框架。本研究还结合排列重要性和内部与外部重要性的SHAP进行了研究。",
