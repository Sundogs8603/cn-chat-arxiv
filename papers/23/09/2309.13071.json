    "translated_abstract": "程序化内容生成（PCG）是一种算法生成内容的方法，通常应用于游戏。已经有一些基于机器学习的PCG方法出现在已发表的游戏中。然而，在游戏开发的早期阶段应用这些方法可能会很困难。PCG需要在规则或函数中表示设计师对质量的概念的专业知识，而基于机器学习的PCG通常需要大量的训练数据，这在开发初期可能无法获取。本文介绍了一种名为基于树的重建分区（TRP）的新颖PCGML方法，旨在解决这个问题。我们在两个领域的实验结果表明，TRP生成的关卡更具可玩性和连贯性，并且这种方法在使用较少训练数据的情况下更具泛化能力。我们认为TRP是一种有前途的新方法，可以使PCGML在游戏开发的早期阶段引入，而不需要人类专业知识或大量训练数据。",
