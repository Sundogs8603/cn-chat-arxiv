Traditional EEG classification models, however, have often overlooked or inadequately leveraged the brain's topological information. Recognizing this shortfall, there has been a burgeoning interest in recent years in harnessing the potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to exploit the topological information by modeling features selected from each EEG channel in a graph structure. To further facilitate research in this direction, we introduce GNN4EEG, a versatile and user-friendly toolkit for GNN-based modeling of EEG signals.

    "translated_abstract": "脑电图（EEG）分类是神经科学、神经工程和几个商业应用中关键的任务。然而，传统的EEG分类模型常常忽视或不充分利用大脑的拓扑信息。鉴于此，近年来，利用图神经网络（GNN）来建模由每个EEG通道选择的特征，并利用拓扑信息的潜力已引起了广泛的兴趣。为进一步促进在这个方向上的研究，我们介绍了GNN4EEG，这是一个用于基于GNN对EEG信号建模的通用且易于使用的工具包。GNN4EEG包括三个组成部分：（i）一个大型基准，根据来自123名参与者的EEG数据构建了四个EEG分类任务。（ii）易于使用的各种最先进的基于GNN的EEG分类模型的实现，例如DGCNN、RGNN等。（iii）全面的实验设置的实现。",
