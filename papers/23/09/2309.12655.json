    "translated_abstract": "自然修正看起来很自然：它尽可能少地改变信念来融入新信息。然而，一些反例显示这是错误的。它非常保守，从不完全相信。它只在当前条件下相信。这在某些情况下是正确的，在其他情况下是错误的。哪种情况是哪种情况？回答这个问题需要将自然修正从表达普遍真理的简单公式（某物成立）扩展到表达条件真理的条件语句（某种情况下成立）。这种扩展基于自然修正遵循的基本原则，被确定为最小改变、漠不关心和天真：尽可能少地改变信念；默认情况下将场景的可能性视为相等；对所有情况持有信念，直到有矛盾发生。扩展表明自然修正将修正限制在当前条件下。与不受限制的修正进行比较可以确定当前条件。它不是当前被认为是真的，如果与新信息相矛盾的话。",
