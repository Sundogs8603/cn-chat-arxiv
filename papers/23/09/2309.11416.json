    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了关于存在性和唯一性的新结果，针对具有替代品的一般非参数和非可分竞争均衡。这些结果确保了一般竞争系统的可逆性。现有文献主要关注竞争均衡的唯一性，假设存在性成立。我们引入了三个供给系统必须满足的属性：弱替代品、关键替代品和响应性。这些属性足以确保均衡的存在，从而提供了Berry、Gandhi和Haile（2013年）唯一性结果的存在性对应结果。对于两个重要的模型类别，具有完整分配的二部匹配模型和离散选择模型，我们展示了这两个模型都可以重构为一个竞争系统，从而可以方便地应用我们的存在性和唯一性结果。我们还提供了一个计算唯一竞争均衡的算法。此外，我们认为我们的结果是重要的。",
