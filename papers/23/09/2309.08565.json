    "translated_abstract": "最近，将机器翻译模型定制为符合细粒度属性（如形式）已取得了巨大进展。然而，当前方法大多依赖于至少一些带有属性注释的监督数据。因此，数据稀缺仍然是将此定制能力普及到更广泛语言范围，尤其是低资源语言的一个瓶颈。鉴于最近在预训练大规模多语言翻译模型方面取得的进展，我们将它们作为对没有监督数据的语言进行属性控制能力迁移的基础。在这项工作中，我们基于预训练的NLLB-200模型对属性控制器的迁移进行了全面分析。我们研究了在各种数据场景下的训练和推断时控制技术，并揭示了它们在零样本性能和领域鲁棒性上的相对优势和劣势。我们显示出两种范式是互补的，通过一致的改进来证明。",
