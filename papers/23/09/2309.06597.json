    "translated_abstract": "商用自动驾驶车辆（AVs）和先进驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）的广泛应用可能在很大程度上取决于社会对它们的接受程度，而对骑车人来说，它们被视为可信和可解释性是至关重要的。一般来说，这个任务是具有挑战性的，因为现代自主系统软件严重依赖于黑盒人工智能模型。为了实现这个目标，本文介绍了一种新的数据集，Rank2Tell，这是一个用于重要性级别排序和原因解释的多模态驾驶数据集。使用各种闭合和开放式视觉问答，该数据集提供了复杂交通情景中各种重要对象的各种语义、空间、时间和关系属性的密集注释。数据集的密集注释和独特属性使其成为从事视觉场景理解和相关领域研究的研究人员的宝贵资源。此外，我们还介绍了一个联合模型，用于联合表示和推理重要性和原因。",
