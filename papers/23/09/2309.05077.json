    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了具有有界更新的迭代学习算法在非凸损失函数上的泛化特性，采用了信息论技术。我们的主要贡献是针对具有有界更新的算法提出了一种新颖的泛化误差界限，超出了以前只关注随机梯度下降（SGD）的范围。我们的方法引入了两个主要的创新之处：1）我们将互信息重新定义为更新的不确定性，提供了一种新的视角；2）我们不使用互信息的链式法则，而是采用方差分解技术来将信息分解到迭代中，从而允许简化的代理过程。我们在各种设置下分析了我们的泛化界限，并在模型维度以与训练数据样本数量相同的速率增加时展示了改进的界限。为了弥合理论与实践之间的差距，我们还研究了先前观察到的情况。",
