    "translated_abstract": "正类-未标记（PU）学习是二分类问题的一个挑战，在这种问题中存在大量未标记数据和少量正类数据实例，可以用于慢性病筛查问题。最先进的PU学习方法已经导致了各种风险估计器的发展，然而它们忽视了不同人群之间的差异。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的正类-未标记学习树（PUtree）算法。PUtree旨在考虑社区，如不同的年龄或收入段，在慢性病预测任务中。我们提出了一种新的二分类决策方法，它以层次方式构建基于社区的PU模型，然后聚合它们的输出。我们的方法可以解释树上每个PU模型，以优化非叶节点的分裂。此外，一种掩码恢复数据增强策略使得模型在个体上能进行充分训练。",
