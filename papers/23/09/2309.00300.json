    "translated_abstract": "认知诊断旨在根据学生在考试题目上的答题成绩来诊断他们的知识水平，这是许多领域如计算自适应测试的基础。现有的认知诊断模型（CDMs）遵循了一个能力-响应范式，即将诊断结果视为学生响应的原因，并通过优化来学习诊断结果。然而，这种范式很容易导致不可识别的诊断结果和解释过拟合问题，这对于学生学习表现的量化是有害的。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的可识别的认知诊断框架。具体而言，我们首先提出了一个灵活的诊断模块，该模块直接从响应日志中诊断可识别和可解释的考生特征和题目特征。接下来，我们利用一个通用的预测模块从诊断结果中重建响应日志，以确保诊断结果的可识别性。",
