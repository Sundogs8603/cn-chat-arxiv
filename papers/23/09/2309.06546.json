    "translated_abstract": "在将单个非可消耗商品分配给偏好单峰的代理人问题中，我们研究了一种被称为不明显可操纵（NOM）的策略无效性的弱化形式。如果代理人认知能力有限，则NOM足以描述他们的战略行为。我们对一大类满足效率、NOM和最小公平条件的仅具单峰特点的规则进行了特征化，称之为“简单”规则。在存在过剩需求的经济中，简单规则完全满足峰值少于或等于平等分配的代理人，并向每个剩余代理人分配介于平等分配和其峰值之间的金额。在存在过剩供应的经济中，简单规则对称定义。我们还证明了单平台域是简单规则特征属性的最大域。因此，虽然将策略无效性替换为NOM大大扩展了可接受规则的范围，但所涉及的偏好的最大域基本保持不变。",
