    "translated_abstract": "企业优化是寻找和实施高效和具有成本效益的运营方式，以为企业带来竞争优势的过程。综合问题表述是企业优化的一个重要组成部分，它围绕着人类专业知识展开，因此很有可能成为瓶颈。随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的最新进展，通过人工智能（AI）可以潜在地减少问题表述中所需的人类专业知识。然而，开发用于问题表述的LLM具有挑战性，由于训练数据要求、令牌限制以及LLM中缺乏适当的性能度量。为了减少大量训练数据的需求，最近人们开始关注对预训练的LLM进行微调以适应下游任务，而不是从头开始训练一个特定任务的LLM。在本文中，我们采用了这种方法，提出了一个AI-企业优化的协同辅助系统。",
