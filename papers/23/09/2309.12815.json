    "translated_abstract": "模仿学习是训练游戏智能体和高效游戏生成的有效方法。然而，泛化能力——在相关但未见过的场景中表现出良好性能的能力——对于游戏人工智能来说仍然是一个未解决的挑战。模仿学习智能体的泛型化很困难，因为它需要算法在训练分布之外采取有意义的行动。本文提出了解决这一挑战的方法。在受监督学习中数据增强的成功启发下，我们通过增强训练数据的方法，使数据集中的状态和行动分布更好地代表真实的状态-行动分布。本研究评估了将数据增强应用于观察的方法，以提高模仿学习智能体的泛化能力，并在多个3D环境中对这些增强技术进行了性能基准测试。结果表明，数据增强可以显著提高模仿学习智能体的泛化能力。",
