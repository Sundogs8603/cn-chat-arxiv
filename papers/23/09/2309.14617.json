    "translated_abstract": "人工智能旨在通过辅助临床决策支持将医疗提升到一个巅峰。解决与设计伦理人工智能相关的挑战将使临床医生、医生、医疗专业人员和其他利益相关者能够在医疗环境中使用和信赖人工智能。本研究试图通过主题分析，识别影响人工智能在不同技术层面（如数据获取、算法和系统）的效用表现的主要伦理原则。我们观察到，正义、隐私、偏见、缺乏规定、风险和可解释性是考虑伦理人工智能的最重要原则。该数据驱动的研究通过对36位人工智能专家的皮尤研究中心（2020年）的二次调查数据进行分析，将人工智能设计的顶级伦理原则进行分类。为了解决元分析和领域专家所发现的伦理问题，我们提出了一个基于功利主义伦理的人工智能理论框架，用于设计伦理人工智能。",
