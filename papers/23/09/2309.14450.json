    "translated_abstract": "离散位错动力学（DDD）的计算方法被用作真正的原子尺度晶格位错动力学的粗粒化模型，它已经成为研究由位错的集体行为引起的金属塑性的强大工具。作为一种介观尺度的方法，DDD模型中位错的运动通过迁移规律来预定；迁移规律是指位错线应如何响应驱动力的函数。然而，传统的手工制作的迁移规律的开发可能是一个麻烦的任务，可能涉及具有负面影响的简化。在这里，我们介绍了一种机器学习（ML）框架，以简化数据驱动的迁移规律的开发，这些规律被模拟为在大规模分子动力学（MD）模拟的晶体塑性上训练的图神经网络（GNN）。我们以BCC钨为例说明了我们的方法，并证明了我们在大规模DDS模拟中实现的GNN迁移规律能够准确地重现具有挑战性的拉伸/压缩行为。",
