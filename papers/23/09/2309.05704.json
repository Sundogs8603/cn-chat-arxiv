    "translated_abstract": "高分辨率探测器的能量沉积的快速模拟对于未来具有不断增加亮度的对撞机实验至关重要。生成式机器学习（ML）模型已经被证明可以加快和增强物理分析中的传统模拟链。然而，大多数以前的努力局限于依赖于固定、规则的探测器读出几何的模型。最近提出的CaloClouds模型是一个几何独立的扩散模型，为设想中的国际大型探测器（ILD）的电磁量能器生成块状点云。在这项工作中，我们介绍了CaloClouds II，它具有一些关键的改进。这包括基于连续时间得分的建模，它允许进行25步采样，与CaloClouds的保真度相当，同时在单个CPU上比Geant4快6倍（比CaloClouds快5倍）。我们进一步将扩散模型提炼成一种新的模型。",
