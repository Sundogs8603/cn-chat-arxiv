    "translated_abstract": "SHAP（SHapley加性解释）已成为一种流行的方法，用于将机器学习模型对输入的预测归因于其特征。SHAP的主要挑战之一是计算时间。精确计算Shapley值需要指数时间复杂度。因此，文献中提出了许多近似方法。在本文中，我们提出了能够在多项式时间内或甚至更快地计算出满足可加性和虚拟假设（例如，核心SHAP和基线SHAP）定义的SHAP的方法。我们针对具有不同模型结构信息水平的模型开发了不同的策略：已知功能分解的情况、已知模型顺序（定义为模型中最高交互作用的顺序）的情况，或未知顺序的情况。对于第一种情况，我们演示了可加性属性和从较低阶功能组件计算SHAP的方法。对于第二种情况，我们推导出能够在多项式时间内计算SHAP的公式。两种方法都在实验中得到了验证。",
