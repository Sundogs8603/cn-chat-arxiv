    "translated_abstract": "最近在使用机器学习模型进行推理任务方面取得了进展，这得益于新颖的模型架构、大规模的预训练协议以及专门用于微调的推理数据集。在这项工作中，为了进一步推动这些进展，我们引入了一个与体验智能体集成的新数据生成器用于机器推理。生成的数据包括模板化的文本查询和答案，与编码为数据库的世界状态相匹配。这些世界状态是世界动态和智能体行为的结果。我们展示了几种基准模型在训练集实例化上的结果。这些基准模型包括在数据库的文本格式化表示上进行微调的预训练语言模型，以及在知识图表示的图结构Transformer上操作的模型。我们发现这些模型可以回答一些关于世界状态的问题，但在其他问题上存在困难。这些结果暗示了设计神经网络推理新的研究方向。",
