    "translated_abstract": "随着技术的快速发展和智能手机的广泛使用，移动应用的数量呈指数级增长。找到一组符合用户需求和偏好的合适应用可能具有挑战性。然而，移动应用推荐系统已经成为简化这一过程的有用工具。但是，使用应用推荐系统存在一个缺点，即这些系统需要访问用户数据，这是一种严重的安全违规。虽然用户寻求准确的意见，但不希望在此过程中损害自己的隐私。我们通过开发SAppKG来解决这个问题，这是一个端到端的用户隐私保护知识图谱架构，基于知识图谱模型，如SAppKG-S和SAppKG-D，利用应用交互数据和侧面信息进行移动应用推荐。我们在来自谷歌Play应用商店的真实数据上对所提出的模型进行了测试，使用了精确度、召回率、平均绝对精确度和。均方根误差等指标进行评估。",
