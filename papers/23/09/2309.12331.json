With 77% of high school students previously reporting engagement in dishonest behaviour, the rise of AI-driven writing assistance, dubbed 'AI-giarism' by Chan (arXiv:2306.03358v2), will make plagiarism more accessible and less detectable.

    "translated_abstract": "在2023-2024学年，ChatGPT每月1.6亿次访问的广泛普及，将对学术诚信产生影响。高中学生中有77％曾报告参与不诚实行为，由Chan（arXiv:2306.03358v2）称为“AI抄袭”的AI驱动写作辅助的兴起将使抄袭更加容易和不易检测。虽然这些问题迫在眉睫，但它们也引发了对这项技术革命性质的更广泛的问题，包括自主性、数据隐私、版权和公平性。本文旨在从社会正义的角度探讨生成人工智能，考察这些模型的训练、固有的偏见以及检测AI生成写作中的潜在不公正性。",
