    "abstract": "Community Question Answering (CQA) in different domains is growing at a large scale because of the availability of several platforms and huge shareable information among users. With the rapid growth of such online platforms, a massive amount of archived data makes it difficult for moderators to retrieve possible duplicates for a new question and identify and confirm existing question pairs as duplicates at the right time. This problem is even more critical in CQAs corresponding to large software systems like askubuntu where moderators need to be experts to comprehend something as a duplicate. Note that the prime challenge in such CQA platforms is that the moderators are themselves experts and are therefore usually extremely busy with their time being extraordinarily expensive. To facilitate the task of the moderators, in this work, we have tackled two significant issues for the askubuntu CQA platform: (1) retrieval of duplicate questions given a new question and (2) duplicate question ",

    "translated_abstract": "由于存在多个平台和用户之间的大规模共享信息，不同领域的社区问答（CQA）正在快速增长。随着这些在线平台的快速增长，大量的存档数据使得管理员难以检索新问题的可能重复，并在适当的时间识别和确认现有问题对作为重复问题。这个问题在类似askubuntu这样的大型软件系统对应的CQA中尤为重要，管理员需要是专家才能理解问题是否为重复。需要注意的是，在这样的CQA平台上，主要挑战在于管理员本身就是专家，因此通常时间非常宝贵，非常忙碌。为了帮助管理员完成任务，在本研究中，我们解决了askubuntu CQA平台上的两个重大问题：（1）给定一个新问题，检索重复问题；（2）重复问题确认的时间预测。",
