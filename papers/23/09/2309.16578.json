    "translated_abstract": "无轨道密度泛函理论（OFDFT）是一种具有较低运算成本的量子化学计算方法，比起常用的Kohn-Sham密度泛函理论更加适用于当代分子研究。然而，OFDFT的精确性受到了动能密度泛函的限制，对于非周期性分子系统的近似求解非常困难。本文提出了名为M-OFDFT的方法，利用深度学习的函数模型解决了分子系统的问题。我们将必要的非局域性建立在这个模型中，通过原子基下的展开系数作为紧凑的密度表示来降低成本。通过解决其中的非传统学习挑战的技术，M-OFDFT在一系列OFDFT无法触及的分子上实现了与Kohn-Sham DFT相当的精确度。更有吸引力的是，M-OFDFT在训练时属于更大的分子中有着良好的外推能力，为研究大分子提供了有吸引力的规模效应。",
