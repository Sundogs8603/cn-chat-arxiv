    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统被广泛用于为用户提供个性化推荐。最近的研究表明，推荐系统可能存在不同类型的偏见，如流行度偏见，导致生产者群体之间的推荐曝光分布不均衡。为了减轻这种情况，研究者提出了以生产者为中心的公平重新排名（PFR）方法，以确保各组之间的推荐效用公平。然而，这些方法忽视了它们对与冷门物品（即与用户的交互很少或没有交互的物品）相关的组内个体可能造成的伤害。本研究复现了先前的PFR方法，并显示它们在冷门物品上造成了显著的伤害，导致这些物品在优势和劣势组中出现了公平差距。令人惊讶的是，不公平的基准推荐模型给予这些冷门个体更多的曝光机会，尽管总体上看起来是不公平的。为了解决这个问题，",
