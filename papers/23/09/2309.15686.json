    "abstract": "Incorporating longer context has been shown to benefit machine translation, but the inclusion of context in end-to-end speech translation (E2E-ST) remains under-studied. To bridge this gap, we introduce target language context in E2E-ST, enhancing coherence and overcoming memory constraints of extended audio segments. Additionally, we propose context dropout to ensure robustness to the absence of context, and further improve performance by adding speaker information. Our proposed contextual E2E-ST outperforms the isolated utterance-based E2E-ST approach. Lastly, we demonstrate that in conversational speech, contextual information primarily contributes to capturing context style, as well as resolving anaphora and named entities.",

    "translated_abstract": "已经证明将较长的上下文融入机器翻译可以带来好处，但是端到端对话式语音翻译中的上下文利用还未得到广泛研究。为了弥补这个空白，我们引入目标语言上下文在端到端对话式语音翻译中，增强连贯性并克服扩展音频片段的内存限制。此外，我们提出了上下文丢弃以确保对于上下文缺失具有鲁棒性，并通过添加说话人信息进一步提高性能。我们提出的上下文端到端对话式语音翻译优于孤立的话语为基础的端到端对话式语音翻译方法。最后，我们证明在会话式语音中，上下文信息主要有助于捕捉上下文风格，以及解决指代和命名实体。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a method to enhance end-to-end conversational speech translation by utilizing target language context, which improves coherence and overcomes memory constraints. The proposed approach, including context dropout and speaker information, outperforms previous isolated utterance-based methods and shows the importance of context in capturing context style and resolving anaphora and named entities in conversational speech."
