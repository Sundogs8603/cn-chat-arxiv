    "translated_abstract": "在高风险环境中，能够为人类提供可解释的预测的机器学习模型至关重要。随着复杂的基于深度学习的模型和大量可调参数的出现，这一点变得更加重要。最近，基于原型的方法已经成为使深度学习可解释的一种有前途的方法。我们特别关注在取证环境中对深度伪造视频的分析。尽管原型基方法已经被引入用于检测深度伪造视频，但在实际情况下使用仍然存在重大挑战，原因在于原型往往过于相似，可解释性在不同原型之间变化。本文提出了一种用于原型学习的可视化分析流程模型，并基于此模型提出了ProtoExplorer，一个用于探索和优化基于原型的深度伪造检测模型的可视化分析系统。ProtoExplorer提供了可视化和时间过滤原型的工具。",
