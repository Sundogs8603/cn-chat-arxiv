    "translated_abstract": "在历史上，熟练的写作被认为是人类进步的关键，创造性表达被视为人类成就的标志之一。然而，生成式AI的最新进展标志着这一叙事的一个转折点，包括在科学写作方面。本文全面分析了六个AI聊天机器人在人文学科和考古学方面学术写作中的能力和局限性。方法基于由人类专家对AI生成内容进行定量准确性和定性精确性标记。定量准确性评估了事实的正确性，而定性精确性评估了科学贡献。虽然AI聊天机器人，特别是ChatGPT-4，在重新组合现有知识方面表现出熟练性，但在生成原创科学内容方面失败了。顺便提一下，我们的结果还显示，随着ChatGPT-4，语言模型大小已经停滞不前。此外，本文强调了复杂且反复无常的生成过程。",
