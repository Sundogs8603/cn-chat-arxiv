    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于模仿的驾驶规划器取得了相当大的成功。然而，由于缺乏统一的基准测试，不同设计的有效性仍然不清楚。新发布的nuPlan通过提供大规模的实际数据集和标准化闭环基准测试来解决这个问题，以进行公平比较。利用这个平台，我们对基于模仿的规划器的两个基本但未被充分研究的方面进行了全面的研究：自我规划所需的关键特征和降低复合误差的有效数据增强技术。此外，我们强调了当前学习系统忽视的模仿差距。最后，整合我们的发现，我们提出了一个强大的基线模型-PlanTF。我们的结果表明，一个设计良好的纯模仿规划器可以与涉及手工制定规则的现有方法实现高竞争性性能，并展示出更好的推广能力。",
