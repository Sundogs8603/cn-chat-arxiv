    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习正在分布式边缘应用中崭露头角作为一种保护隐私的模型训练方法。然而，大多数边缘部署是异构的，即它们的感知能力和环境在部署中各不相同。这种边缘异构违反了本地数据在客户端之间独立且分布相同 (IID) 的特性，产生了有偏见的全局模型，即对特定社区或群体做出不公平的决策和歧视。现有的偏见缓解技术只关注非IID数据中由标签异构引起的偏见，并没有考虑由特征异构导致的领域变化，也没有解决全局群体公平的问题。我们的工作提出了一种在保护隐私和不增加资源利用开销的情况下，减少群体偏见的联邦学习框架。我们的主要思想是利用平均条件概率来计算跨域群体重要性。",
