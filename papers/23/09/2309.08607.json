    "translated_abstract": "不断监测城市变化的能力具有巨大的社会经济利益。之前的研究已经展示了使用深度神经网络（DNNs）和迁移学习在这一领域的方法。然而，它们未能展示在训练或迁移领域之外的时间尺度。本研究在现有研究的基础上，证明了使用历史数据进行迁移学习是可行的解决方案，仍然可以对以后的年份进行城市变化监测。我们考虑了一个对公共和免费高分辨率图像访问有限的情况来指导迁移。为了提供高时空分辨率，我们的监测方法的核心数据包括来自Sentinel 1（合成孔径雷达）和Sentinel 2（光学多光谱）的多模态合成孔径雷达和光学多光谱观测。我们选择了实际应用我们的方法来监测乌克兰马里乌波尔市与俄乌冲突开始时的相关城市变化。",
