    "translated_abstract": "通用漏洞和暴露（CVE）是主动网络安全措施的关键信息，包括服务补丁、安全加固等。然而，CVE通常提供基于产品的低级描述，公开披露的网络安全漏洞缺乏综合弱点特征和威胁影响估计所需的攻击语义信息。这种关键的洞察力对于CVE优先级和潜在对策的识别至关重要，特别是在处理大量CVE时。目前的行业实践涉及对CVE进行手动评估，使用通用漏洞评分系统（CVSS）评估攻击严重性，并将其映射到通用弱点枚举（CWE）以进行潜在缓解的识别。不幸的是，这种手动分析在漏洞分析过程中形成了一个主要瓶颈，导致主动网络安全工作的放缓。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种自动化CVE分析方法，用于威胁优先级和影响预测。它解决了CVE描述的缺陷，通过提供攻击语义信息，使得CVE的综合弱点特征和威胁影响得以全面评估。这种自动化分析方法可以大大加快CVE漏洞分析的速度和效率。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an automated CVE analysis method for threat prioritization and impact prediction. It addresses the deficiencies in CVE descriptions by providing attack semantic information, enabling comprehensive assessment of weakness characteristics and threat impact. This automated analysis method can significantly speed up the CVE vulnerability analysis process."
