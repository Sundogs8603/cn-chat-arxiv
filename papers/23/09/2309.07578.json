    "abstract": "We present a novel approach to address the challenge of generalization in offline reinforcement learning (RL), where the agent learns from a fixed dataset without any additional interaction with the environment. Specifically, we aim to improve the agent's ability to generalize to out-of-distribution goals. To achieve this, we propose to learn a dynamics model and check if it is equivariant with respect to a fixed type of transformation, namely translations in the state space. We then use an entropy regularizer to increase the equivariant set and augment the dataset with the resulting transformed samples. Finally, we learn a new policy offline based on the augmented dataset, with an off-the-shelf offline RL algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach can greatly improve the test performance of the policy on the considered environments.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的方法来解决离线强化学习中的泛化挑战，其中智能体从固定数据集中学习而无需与环境进行额外交互。具体而言，我们旨在提高智能体对于超出分布范围的目标的泛化能力。为实现这一目标，我们提出了一种学习动力学模型并检查其是否等变于固定类型的变换，即状态空间中的平移。然后，我们使用一个熵正则化器来扩展等变集并通过所得到的转换样本对数据集进行增强。最后，我们基于增强的数据集使用一个现成的离线强化学习算法离线学习一个新的策略。我们的实验结果表明，我们的方法能够极大地提高策略在考虑的环境中的测试性能。",
