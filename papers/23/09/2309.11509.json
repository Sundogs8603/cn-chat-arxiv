We concluded that: (a) Data-driven models' accuracy assessment or domain knowledge screening may not rule out biased and spurious results; (b) Data-driven models' feature selection should involve careful consideration of causal relationships, especially colliders; (c) Causal analysis results can be used as an aid to first-principles simulation design and parameter checking to avoid cognitive biases.

    "translated_abstract": "实际实施中的决策过程受到对数据驱动模型越来越多的依赖的影响。我们研究了数据驱动方法、经验领域知识和第一原理模拟之间的协同模式。我们展示了在没有因果分析的情况下使用数据驱动模型可能导致偏倚结果的潜在风险。通过对一栋建筑的多个设计方案对能源消耗的影响进行案例研究，我们证明了在数据驱动建模过程中进行因果分析的必要性。我们得出以下结论：(a) 数据驱动模型的准确性评估或领域知识筛选可能无法排除偏倚和虚假结果；(b) 数据驱动模型的特征选择应该仔细考虑因果关系，尤其是协变量；(c) 因果分析的结果可以作为第一原理模拟设计和参数检查的辅助工具，以避免认知偏差。我们证明了因果分析的好处。",
