    "translated_abstract": "降水预测（几小时内）仍然是一项挑战，因为需要准确捕捉复杂的局部相互作用。卷积神经网络依赖于卷积核与网格数据进行卷积，并且提取的特征受限于有限的感知域，通常表现为与真实数据相比过度平滑的输出。因此，它们缺乏对网格之间复杂空间关系的建模能力。几何深度学习旨在将神经网络模型推广到非欧几里德域。这些模型在定义节点和边缘方面更加灵活，并且能够有效地捕捉地理网格之间的动态空间关系。受此启发，我们探索了一种基于几何深度学习的时间图卷积网络（GCN）应用于降水预测。自动学习描述网格单元之间相互作用的邻接矩阵，通过最小化预测值与真实像素值之间的L1损失来实现。",
