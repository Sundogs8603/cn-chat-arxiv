    "abstract": "Dialect identification is a critical task in speech processing and language technology, enhancing various applications such as speech recognition, speaker verification, and many others. While most research studies have been dedicated to dialect identification in widely spoken languages, limited attention has been given to dialect identification in low-resource languages, such as Romanian. To address this research gap, we introduce RoDia, the first dataset for Romanian dialect identification from speech. The RoDia dataset includes a varied compilation of speech samples from five distinct regions of Romania, covering both urban and rural environments, totaling 2 hours of manually annotated speech data. Along with our dataset, we introduce a set of competitive models to be used as baselines for future research. The top scoring model achieves a macro F1 score of 59.83% and a micro F1 score of 62.08%, indicating that the task is challenging. We thus believe that RoDia is a valuable resource",

    "translated_abstract": "方言识别是语音处理和语言技术中关键的任务，可以增强诸如语音识别、说话人验证等各种应用。尽管大多数研究都集中在广为使用的语言的方言识别上，但对于罗马尼亚这种资源有限的低资源语言的方言识别却没有得到足够的关注。为了填补这一研究空白，我们引入了RoDia，这是第一个用于罗马尼亚方言识别的语音数据集。RoDia数据集包含了来自罗马尼亚五个不同地区的各种语音样本，涵盖了城市和农村环境，总共有2小时的手动标注语音数据。除了我们的数据集之外，我们还介绍了一组可作为未来研究基准的竞争模型。最高得分的模型的宏F1分数为59.83%，微F1分数为62.08%，说明该任务具有挑战性。因此，我们认为RoDia是一个有价值的资源。",
