Considering two simulated indoor environments and a real-world dataset containing human activities and sensor triggers, we show that our proposed method performs better compared to state-of-the-art black-box optimization techniques in identifying high-quality sensor placements, leading to accurate activity recognition in terms of F1-score, while also requiring a significantly lower (51.3% on average) number of expensive function ",

    "translated_abstract": "优化传感器的配置和布置对于可靠的跌倒检测、室内定位和活动识别在辅助生活空间中至关重要。我们提出了一种新颖的、样本高效的方法，基于灰盒贝叶斯优化和基于仿真的评估，在任意室内空间中找到高质量的传感器布置。我们的关键技术贡献在于捕捉关于活动的空间分布的领域特定知识，并将其纳入贝叶斯优化的迭代查询点选择中。通过考虑两个模拟室内环境和包含人类活动和传感器触发的真实数据集，我们表明我们提出的方法在识别高质量传感器布置方面比现有的黑盒优化技术表现更好，在F1得分方面实现了准确的活动识别，同时还需要大幅度减少(平均减少51.3%)昂贵的函数次数。",
