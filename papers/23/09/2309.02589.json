    "translated_abstract": "本文中，我们计算了更高维度中最小曲面的数值逼近，这是一种重要的偏微分方程类型。由于维数的诅咒导致传统方法无法处理这种情况，这些方法的计算成本会随维数增加而指数级增长，远远超出任何现代超级计算机的计算能力。只有在过去几年中，机器学习研究人员才能够缓解这个问题。本文选择的解决方法是一种称为物理知识的神经网络（Physics-Informed Neural Network，PINN）的模型，它训练了一个深度神经网络（Deep Neural Network，DNN）来解决最小曲面偏微分方程。它可以在更高维度上扩展，并且即使在没有GPU的笔记本电脑上也能相对快速地训练。由于无法查看高维度输出，我们的数据以足够的固定轴的片段形式呈现，以便通过3D图形进行查看。",
