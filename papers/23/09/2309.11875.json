    "translated_abstract": "使用结构健康监测数据训练的机器学习模型已成为系统识别的强大工具。本文提出了一种基于物理信息的高斯过程模型，用于Timoshenko梁元素。该模型是一个多输出高斯过程，其协方差和交叉协方差核根据挠度、转动、应变、弯矩、剪力和施加载荷的微分方程解析地推导而来。通过马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法在贝叶斯格式下进行刚度识别，最大化后验模型，得到结构参数的随机模型。优化后的高斯过程模型进一步用于对未观测到的响应进行概率预测。此外，还提出了一种基于熵的物理信息传感器布置优化方法，利用异质传感器位置信息和嵌入高斯过程模型的结构边界条件。结果表明，所提出的方法能有效识别刚度并预测未观测到的响应。",
