    "translated_abstract": "金融模拟器在提升预测准确性、管理风险和促进战略金融决策方面发挥着重要作用。尽管已经开发了金融市场模拟方法，但现有的框架常常难以适应专门的模拟上下文。我们将挑战归结为：i）当前的金融数据集不包含上下文标签；ii）当前的技术没有设计用于生成具有上下文控制的金融数据，与其他模态相比，这要求更高的精度；iii）由于金融数据的非平稳、噪声性质，生成与上下文对齐、高保真度的数据存在困难。为了解决这些挑战，我们的贡献是：i）提出了具有市场动态、股票代码和历史状态作为上下文的上下文市场数据集，利用线性回归和动态时间扭曲聚类结合的市场动态建模方法提取市场动态；ii）我们预先准备了Market-GAN模型，该模型通过使用条件生成对抗网络（GAN）的方法以及编码上下文向量的方式来实现对金融数据生成的控制。",
