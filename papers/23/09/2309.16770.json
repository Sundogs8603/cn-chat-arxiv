However, it is still very challenging to leverage auxiliary information that can provide conversational context or personalized tuning to improve the quality of conversations. For example, there has only been limited research on using an individuals persona information to improve conversation quality, and even state-of-the-art conversational AI techniques are unable to effectively leverage signals from heterogeneous sources of auxiliary data, such as multi-modal interaction data, demographics, SDOH data, etc. In this paper, we present a novel Persona-Coded Poly-Encoder method that leverages persona information in a multi-stream encoding scheme to improve the quality of response generation for conversations. To show the efficacy of the proposed method, we evaluate our method on two different persona-based conversational datasets, and compared against ",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习和深度学习的最新进展已经在许多实际应用中广泛应用于对话AI。然而，要利用可以提供对话背景或个性化调整的辅助信息以提高对话质量仍然很具挑战性。例如，关于使用个人角色信息来提高对话质量的研究仅有限，即使是最先进的对话AI技术也无法有效地利用来自多种来源的辅助数据信号，例如多模式交互数据、人口统计学数据和社会确定因素数据等。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的Persona编码多流程对话句子评分方法，它利用多流程编码方案中的个人角色信息来提高对话生成的质量。为了展示所提出方法的有效性，我们在两个不同的基于个人角色的对话数据集上评估了我们的方法，并与参考方法进行了比较。",
