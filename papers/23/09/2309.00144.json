    "translated_abstract": "集成接入和回传（IAB）是满足未来几代对更高数据速率需求的一种可行方法，作为密集光纤连接的经济有效替代方案。具有约束条件的这种网络设计通常会导致非凸性和组合性的优化问题。在这些情况下，为联合子通道分配和功率分配（SAPA）问题获得最优策略是具有挑战性的。本文提出了一种基于多Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning（DeepRL）的框架，用于在IAB网络中联合优化功率和子通道分配，以最大化下行数据速率。使用DDQN（Double Deep Q-Learning Network）的SAPA可以处理与多个用户和节点相关联的具有巨大行动空间的计算密集型问题。与传统方法（如博弈论，分数规划和凸优化）不同，这些方法在实践中需要越来越精确的网络。",
