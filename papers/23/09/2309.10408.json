    "translated_abstract": "数据聚类是无监督学习的关键组成部分，其任务是根据相似性对观测结果进行分组，广泛应用于生物学、医学和社会科学等多个领域。然而，在这些领域中，数据的不同维度之间存在着复杂的相互依赖关系，例如人们在复杂的社交网络中可能具有的各种特征和观点。当前的聚类方法很难处理这种复杂性：深度学习可以近似这些依赖关系，但不能将其显式地作为分析的输入。本文旨在解决无监督学习文献中的这个盲点。我们通过估计数值节点属性之间的网络距离来创建网络感知嵌入，通过广义欧氏距离计算。与我们所知道的所有文献中的方法不同，我们不是对网络的节点进行聚类，而是对其节点属性进行聚类。在我们的实验中，还展示了我们方法的性能。",
