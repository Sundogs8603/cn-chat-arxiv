    "abstract": "Blockwise self-attentional encoder models have recently emerged as one promising end-to-end approach to simultaneous speech translation. These models employ a blockwise beam search with hypothesis reliability scoring to determine when to wait for more input speech before translating further. However, this method maintains multiple hypotheses until the entire speech input is consumed -- this scheme cannot directly show a single \\textit{incremental} translation to users. Further, this method lacks mechanisms for \\textit{controlling} the quality vs. latency tradeoff. We propose a modified incremental blockwise beam search incorporating local agreement or hold-$n$ policies for quality-latency control. We apply our framework to models trained for online or offline translation and demonstrate that both types can be effectively used in online mode.  Experimental results on MuST-C show 0.6-3.6 BLEU improvement without changing latency or 0.8-1.4 s latency improvement without changing quality.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于分块自注意编码模型作为一种有前途的端到端方法在同时语音翻译领域崭露头角。这些模型采用分块束搜索和假设可靠性评分来确定何时等待更多输入语音以便进一步翻译。然而，这种方法直到整个语音输入被消耗掉才能展示出单个的增量翻译，无法直接向用户展示出单个增量翻译。此外，这种方法缺乏控制质量与延迟权衡的机制。我们提出了一种改进的增量分块束搜索方法，结合了本地一致性或保持-n策略用于质量-延迟控制。我们将我们的框架应用于在线或离线翻译模型中，并证明这两种类型都可以有效地在在线模式中使用。MuST-C的实验结果显示0.6-3.6 BLEU的提升而不改变延迟，或0.8-1.4秒的延迟提升而不改变质量。",
