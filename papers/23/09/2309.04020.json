    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种新颖的用于约束分配问题的机制家族，称之为本地优先机制。这些机制由一个函数参数化，该函数将一组代理人（即本地妥协者）指派给每个不可行的分配。然后，机制贪婪地尝试将代理人与其首选项进行匹配。每当它达到一个不可行的分配时，本地妥协者移动到他们下一个最喜欢的替代方案。本地优先机制对于任何约束问题都存在，因此这提供了一种构建任何约束分配问题的新设计的方法。我们给出了表征本地优先机制的公理。由于约束对象分配包括许多经典问题作为特殊约束，我们将这个特征应用于展示几个众所周知的机制，包括用于学校选择的后期接受机制，用于住房分配的顶级交易环和串行独裁可以理解为本地优先机制的实例。",
