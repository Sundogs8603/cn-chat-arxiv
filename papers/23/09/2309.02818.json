    "translated_abstract": "离心压缩机的设计过程需要应用一个优化过程，由于该过程下面的分析方程，计算开销较大。虽然回归替代模型可以大幅减少这个过程的计算开销，主要挑战是缺乏用于训练替代模型的数据。为了战略性地利用标记样本，我们提出了Active-CompDesign框架，其中在可部署的主动学习（AL）环境中将基于热力学的压缩机模型（即我们内部的压缩机设计软件）与基于高斯过程的替代模型结合起来。我们首先在离线设置中进行实验，并进一步将其扩展到在线AL框架，其中与基于热力学的压缩机模型的实时交互允许在生产中部署。ActiveCompDesign在替代建模方面显示出显著的性能提升。",
