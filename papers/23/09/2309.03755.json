    "translated_abstract": "合成时间序列生成(TSG)在数据增强、异常检测和隐私保护等多个应用中至关重要。尽管在这个领域取得了重大进展，但现有方法存在三个关键限制：(1)它们经常针对类似的模型类型进行基准测试，限制了对性能能力的整体视角。(2)使用专门的合成和私有数据集引入了偏倚，阻碍了泛化能力。(3)模糊的评估指标，往往与自定义网络或下游任务相结合，阻碍了一致和公平的比较。为了克服这些限制，我们推出了\\textsf {TSGBench}，作为首个TSG基准，旨在统一和全面评估TSG方法。它包括三个模块：(1)一个精心策划的、面向TSG的公开实际数据集收集，以及标准化的预处理流程；(2)一套综合的评估指标套件，包括基本指标",
