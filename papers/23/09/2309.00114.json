    "abstract": "This paper studies how to accurately elicit quality for alternatives with multiple attributes. Two multiple price lists (MPLs) are considered: (i) m-MPL which asks subjects to compare an alternative to money, and (ii) p-MPL where subjects are endowed with money and asked whether they would like to buy an alternative or not. Theoretical results show that m-MPL requires fewer assumptions for accurate quality elicitation compared to p-MPL. Experimental evidence from a within-subject experiment using consumer products shows that switch points between the two MPLs are different, which suggests that quality measures are sensitive to the elicitation method.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究如何准确评估具有多个属性的替代品的质量。研究考虑两种多价格列表（MPLs）：（i）m-MPL，要求被试将一种替代品与金钱进行比较；（ii）p-MPL，被试被赋予金钱，并被询问是否愿意购买一种替代品。理论结果表明，与p-MPL相比，m-MPL对于准确评估质量需要更少的假设。通过使用消费产品的受试者实验的实证证据表明，两种MPL之间的转换点不同，这表明质量测量对 elicitation 方法敏感。",
