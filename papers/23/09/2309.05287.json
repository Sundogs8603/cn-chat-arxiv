Feature preference problems have primarily been investigated in classification task. However, we observe that feature preference occurs in high-dimensional regression task, specifically, source separation. To mitigate feature preference in source separation, we propose FEAture BAlancing by Suppressing Easy feature (FEABASE). This approach enables efficient data utilization by learning hidden information about the neglected feature. We evaluate our method in a multi-channel source separation task, where feature preference between spatial feature and timbre feature appears.",

    "translated_abstract": "神经网络常常在解决任务时存在特征偏好的问题，即过度依赖某些特定特征而忽视其他特征，即使那些被忽视的特征对任务来说是至关重要的。特征偏好问题主要在分类任务中进行了研究。然而，我们观察到特征偏好也存在于高维回归任务中，特别是源分离任务中。为了减轻源分离中的特征偏好问题，我们提出了一种名为FEAture BAlancing by Suppressing Easy feature（FEABASE）的方法。该方法通过学习被忽视特征的隐藏信息，实现了对数据的高效利用。我们在一个多通道源分离任务中评估了我们的方法，其中出现了空间特征和音色特征之间的特征偏好。",
