    "translated_abstract": "机器学习中的漂移指的是数据或模型运行上下文的统计特性随时间变化而导致性能下降的现象。因此，保持对机器学习模型性能的持续监控过程对于预防潜在性能回退至关重要。然而，有监督的漂移检测方法需要人工标注，从而导致漂移检测和减轻过程时间较长。在我们提出的无监督漂移检测方法中，我们采用了两个步骤的流程。我们的第一步涉及将生产数据的一个样本作为目标分布，将模型训练数据作为参考分布进行编码。在第二步中，我们使用基于核的统计检验，并利用最大均值差异（MMD）距离度量来比较参考分布和目标分布，估计任何潜在的漂移。我们的方法还能确定生产数据子集的漂移情况。",
