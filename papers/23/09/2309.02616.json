    "translated_abstract": "语义通信（SemCom）在实现通信目标的同时减少网络资源消耗方面具有潜力。然而，联合训练语义编码器和解码器以及在网络设备中的部署所带来的计算开销常常被忽视。生成模型人工智能（GAI）的最新进展提供了一种潜在解决方案。GAI模型的强大学习能力表明，在仅利用有限的语义信息（如提示）的情况下，语义解码器可以重构原始消息，而不需要与语义编码器进行联合训练。然而，值得注意的挑战是GAI多样的生成能力引入的不稳定性。这种不稳定性在输出中，如文本生成的图像中表现出来，限制了GAI在需要精确消息恢复的场景（如人脸图像传输）中的直接应用。为了解决上述问题，本文提出了一种基于GAI辅助的多模态提示的SemCom系统，用于精确内容解码。",
