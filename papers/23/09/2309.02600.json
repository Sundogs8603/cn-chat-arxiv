    "translated_abstract": "天气预报在许多领域都起着至关重要的作用，但能够准确捕捉天气系统的复杂动态仍然是传统统计模型面临的挑战。除了自回归时间预测模型（如ARIMA）之外，深度学习技术（如普通的人工神经网络、LSTM和GRU网络）通过捕捉时间依赖性，显示出提高预测准确性的潜力。本文探讨了应用元启发式算法，即遗传算法（GA）、差分进化算法（DE）和粒子群优化算法（PSO），自动搜索这些模型结构中的最优超参数。元启发式算法在全局优化方面表现突出，具有处理非线性问题的鲁棒性、多功能性和可扩展性。我们对集成了元启发式优化的不同模型结构进行了比较分析，评估了它们在天气预报中的表现，基于均方误差（MSE）和平均绝对误差（MAE）等指标。",
