    "translated_abstract": "测试时间自适应旨在将源域模型适应到推断阶段的测试数据中，在适应到未见过的破损情况下取得了成功。然而，在更具挑战性的真实世界情境下，这些尝试可能会失败。现有的研究主要考虑非独立同分布的数据流和持续的领域转移下的真实世界测试时间自适应。在这项工作中，我们首先用全局类别不平衡的测试集来补充现有的真实世界TTA协议。我们证明把所有设置结合起来对现有方法提出了新的挑战。我们认为最先失败的现有方法是因为不加选择地将归一化层适应到不平衡的测试数据上所导致的。为了解决这个缺点，我们提出了一个平衡批量归一化层，在推断阶段替换原来的批量归一化。新的批量归一化层能够适应而不偏向多数类别。我们受到自学习（ST）在无标签学习中的成功启发。",
