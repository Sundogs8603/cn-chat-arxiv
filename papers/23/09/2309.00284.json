    "abstract": "The single-speaker singing voice synthesis (SVS) usually underperforms at pitch values that are out of the singer's vocal range or associated with limited training samples. Based on our previous work, this work proposes a melody-unsupervised multi-speaker pre-training method conducted on a multi-singer dataset to enhance the vocal range of the single-speaker, while not degrading the timbre similarity. This pre-training method can be deployed to a large-scale multi-singer dataset, which only contains audio-and-lyrics pairs without phonemic timing information and pitch annotation. Specifically, in the pre-training step, we design a phoneme predictor to produce the frame-level phoneme probability vectors as the phonemic timing information and a speaker encoder to model the timbre variations of different singers, and directly estimate the frame-level f0 values from the audio to provide the pitch information. These pre-trained model parameters are delivered into the fine-tuning step as prio",

    "translated_abstract": "单声道唱歌声音合成（SVS）通常在歌手音域之外或基于有限的训练样本的音高上效果不佳。基于我们之前的工作，本研究提出了一种基于多歌手数据集进行的无旋律监督多声道预训练方法，以增强单声道的音域，同时不降低音色的相似性。这种预训练方法可以应用于大规模的多歌手数据集，该数据集仅包含音频和歌词配对，没有音素定时信息和音高标注。具体而言，在预训练步骤中，我们设计了一个音素预测器来生成帧级音素概率向量作为音素定时信息，以及一个说话人编码器来建模不同唱歌者的音色变化，并直接从音频中估计帧级f0值来提供音高信息。这些预训练的模型参数在微调步骤中应用。",
