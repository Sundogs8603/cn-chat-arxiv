    "translated_abstract": "多视图学习技术近年来在机器学习领域引起了重要关注，因为它们能够利用多个视图之间的一致性和互补信息。然而，目前对于将现有工作统一到可扩展和鲁棒的学习框架中的泛化多视图框架的研究还不足，因为大部分当前的工作都专注于特定类型的多视图模型。此外，大多数多视图学习方法在特定尺度场景下依赖较重，并且无法整体有效地理解多种尺度。这些限制妨碍了从多视图中有效融合关键信息，导致泛化能力不佳。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种名为Tensorized Consensus Graph Framework (TCGF)的通用多视图表示学习框架。具体而言，它首先提供了一个统一的框架来利用各个视图的表示，",
