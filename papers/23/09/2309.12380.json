    "translated_abstract": "近年来数据的迅猛增长促进了各种统计和深度学习技术的发展和应用，加快了研究和开发活动。然而，并非所有行业都能从数据的增加中同等受益，部分原因是由于数据使用和隐私规定的法律限制，例如医学领域。为了解决这个问题，提出了各种统计披露和隐私保护方法，包括使用合成数据生成。合成数据是基于一些现有数据生成的，目的是尽可能地复制它们，并充当真实敏感数据的代理。本文对生成和评估合成纵向患者数据的方法进行了系统综述，这是医学领域中一种常见的数据类型。该综述遵循PRISMA指南，并涵盖了自2022年底以来的五个数据库的文献。本文描述了17种方法，从传统方法到深度学习方法。",
