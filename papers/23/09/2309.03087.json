    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）近来越来越受欢迎。然而，这些模型通过ChatGPT在教育等敏感领域的普遍可用性对于已有的教育方法的社会影响尚不清楚。尽管如此，学生和教育者已经在已有的教育方法方面体验到了社会影响。我们的工作侧重于高等物理教育，并研究问题解决策略。在一项研究中，具有物理背景的学生被分配解决物理习题，其中一个组有使用互联网搜索引擎的权利（N=12），而另一个组允许使用ChatGPT（N=27）。我们评估了他们的表现、策略和与提供的工具的互动。我们的结果显示，几乎一半的通过ChatGPT支持提供的解答被学生错误地认为是正确的，这表明他们过分信任ChatGPT，即使在他们的专业领域内也是如此。同样地，在42%的情况下，学生使用了复制粘贴来进行查询操作。",
