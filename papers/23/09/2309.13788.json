However, the potential that LLMs such as ChatGPT can be exploited to generate misinformation has posed a serious concern to online safety and public trust. A fundamental research question is: will LLM-generated misinformation cause more harm than human-written misinformation? We propose to tackle this question from the perspective of detection difficulty. We first build a taxonomy of LLM-generated misinformation. Then we categorize and validate the potential real-world methods for generating misinformation with LLMs. Then, through extensive empirical investigation, we discover that LLM-generated misinformation can be harder to detect for humans and detectors compared to human-written misinformation with the same semantics, which suggests it can have more deceptive styles and potentially cause more harm. We also discuss the implications of our discovery",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现产生了深远影响。然而，LLMs（如ChatGPT）可能被利用来生成虚假信息，这给在线安全和公众信任带来了严重关切。一个基本的研究问题是：LLM生成的虚假信息是否会比人类撰写的虚假信息造成更大危害?我们提出从检测难度的角度来探讨这个问题。我们首先建立了一个LLM生成的虚假信息分类法。然后，我们对利用LLMs生成虚假信息的潜在真实世界方法进行分类和验证。通过广泛的实证调查，我们发现与具有相同语义的人类撰写的虚假信息相比，LLM生成的虚假信息对人类和检测器来说更难检测，这表明它可能具有更具欺骗性的风格，潜在地造成更多危害。我们还讨论了我们发现的影响。",
