    "translated_abstract": "变压器在自然语言处理领域取得了显著的进展，但理解其内部机制仍然是一个挑战。本文介绍了一种新颖的几何视角，阐明了变压器操作的内部机制。我们的主要贡献是说明了层归一化如何将潜在特征限制在一个超球面上，从而使注意力能够在该表面上塑造单词的语义表示。这种几何视点无缝地连接了迭代改进和上下文嵌入等已知属性。我们通过探测一个预训练的124M参数的GPT-2模型验证了我们的见解。我们的发现揭示了早期层中清晰的查询-键注意力模式，并在更深的层次上建立在先前关于注意头的专门性的观察基础上。利用这些几何见解，我们提出了对变压器的直观理解，将其描绘为塑造轨迹的过程。",
