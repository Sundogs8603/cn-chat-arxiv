    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）已成为一种有前景的协作机器学习方法，解决了数据隐私问题。然而，现有的FL平台和框架在软件工程师方面存在复杂性、有限的定制选项和可扩展性限制的挑战。在本文中，我们介绍了EdgeFL，一种仅在边缘部署的轻量级分散式FL框架，旨在克服集中式汇总和可伸缩性方面的限制。通过采用仅在边缘进行模型训练和汇总的方法，EdgeFL消除了需要中央服务器的需求，实现了对各种用例的无缝可扩展性。通过简单的集成过程，仅需要四行代码（LOC），软件工程师可以轻松将FL功能融入其AI产品中。此外，EdgeFL提供了灵活的定制汇总函数的能力，使工程师能够根据特定需求进行调整。根据结果，我们证明了EdgeFL在多个数据集和场景中的性能提升。",
