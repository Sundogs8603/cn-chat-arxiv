To help address this new kind of plagiarism, we performed a controlled experiment measuring the inappropriate benefits of using ChatGPT in terms of completion time and programming performance.

    "translated_abstract": "虽然ChatGPT可以帮助学生学习编程，但它也可能被滥用来进行抄袭，这是违反学术诚信的行为。学生可以要求ChatGPT完成编程任务，并从他人的作品中生成解决方案，但却未能正确致谢来源。为了应对这种新型的抄袭行为，我们进行了一项受控实验，以衡量使用ChatGPT的非正当利益，包括完成时间和编程表现。我们还报告了如何通过学生在使用ChatGPT时的行为和通过调查了解学生对ChatGPT的看法来手动识别通过ChatGPT辅助完成的程序。实验中有17名学生参与，他们被要求完成两个编程测试，根据测试被分为两组：一组无需帮助完成测试，另一组可使用ChatGPT辅助完成。我们的研究表明，使用ChatGPT的学生完成编程测试的速度是没有使用ChatGPT的学生的两倍。",
