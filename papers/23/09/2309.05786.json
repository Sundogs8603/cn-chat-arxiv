    "abstract": "This paper introduces Stringesthesia, an interactive and improvised performance paradigm. Stringesthesia uses real-time neuroimaging to connect performers and audiences, enabling direct access to the performers mental state and determining audience participation during the performance. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy, or fNIRS, a noninvasive neuroimaging tool, was used to assess metabolic activity of brain areas collectively associated with a metric we call trust. A visualization representing the real-time measurement of the performers level of trust was projected behind the performer and used to dynamically restrict or promote audience participation. Throughout the paper we discuss prior work that heavily influenced our design, conceptual and methodological issues with using fNIRS technology, system architecture, and feedback from the audience and performer.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了Stringesthesia，一种互动和即兴表演范式。Stringesthesia利用实时神经成像技术将演员和观众连接起来，实现对演员内心状态的直接访问，并确定观众在表演中的参与方式。我们使用一种称为信任的度量标准来评估与大脑代谢活动相关的脑区，采用无创的功能性近红外光谱技术（fNIRS）。将演员的信任水平的实时测量呈现在演员身后的可视化界面中，用于动态限制或促进观众的参与。本文还讨论了对我们设计的前期工作的影响，使用fNIRS技术时的概念和方法上的问题，系统架构以及观众和演员的反馈。",
