    "translated_abstract": "推动机器学习的边界往往需要探索不同的硬件和软件组合。然而，自由地在不同的工具堆栈之间进行实验可能与效率的追求相冲突，这导致了越来越专门的人工智能硬件的出现，并推动了围绕一小部分机器学习框架的整合。如果软件和硬件同时发展，那么探索性研究可能受到限制，使得远离流行工具堆栈的主流思想更加困难。虽然这种摩擦越来越多地影响到机器学习中的创新速度，但据我们所知，工具的不可移植性尚未得到量化。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个问题：流行的机器学习软件框架有多可移植？我们对主要的机器学习框架在不同硬件类型上的可移植性进行了大规模的研究。我们的研究结果描绘出了一个令人不安的画面--当这些框架转移到其他硬件上时，它们可能会丢失超过40%的关键功能。",
