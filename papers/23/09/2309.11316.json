    "abstract": "The competitive nature of Cloud marketplaces as new concerns in delivery of services makes the pricing policies a crucial task for firms. so that, pricing strategies has recently attracted many researchers. Since game theory can handle such competing well this concern is addressed by designing a normal form game between providers in current research. A committee is considered in which providers register for improving their competition based pricing policies. The functionality of game theory is applied to design dynamic pricing policies. The usage of the committee makes the game a complete information one, in which each player is aware of every others payoff functions. The players enhance their pricing policies to maximize their profits. The contribution of this paper is the quantitative modeling of Cloud marketplaces in form of a game to provide novel dynamic pricing strategies; the model is validated by proving the existence and the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium of the game.",

    "translated_abstract": "云市场的竞争性使得定价策略成为企业的一个关键任务，近年来吸引了很多研究者的注意。本研究通过设计一个普通形式的博弈模型来解决这一问题，其中提供者通过一个委员会注册以改善他们的竞争定价策略。博弈论的功能被应用于设计动态定价策略。委员会的使用使得博弈成为一个完全信息的博弈，每个参与者都知道其他人的收益函数。参与者改进他们的定价策略以最大化利润。本文的贡献是以博弈的形式量化了云市场，并提供了新颖的动态定价策略；通过证明博弈的纳什均衡的存在和唯一性验证了该模型。",
