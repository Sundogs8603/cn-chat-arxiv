    "translated_abstract": "歌词翻译作为一个研究了一个世纪的领域，如今吸引着计算语言学研究者的注意。我们在以往研究中发现了两个限制。首先，在歌词翻译研究中，尽管K-pop非常受欢迎，但主要关注的是西方流派和语言，没有研究集中在K-pop上。其次，歌词翻译领域缺乏可公开获得的数据集；据我们所知，目前尚无此类数据集。为了拓宽歌词翻译研究的流派和语言范围，我们引入了一种新颖的可唱歌词翻译数据集，其中约89%为K-pop歌词。该数据集通过逐行和逐节对齐了韩语和英语歌词。我们利用该数据集揭示了K-pop歌词翻译的独特特征，与其他广泛研究的流派区分开，并构建了一个神经歌词翻译模型，从而强调了专用数据集的重要性。",
