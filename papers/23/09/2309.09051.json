    "translated_abstract": "由于在运动中存在固有的变形不确定性，以往的可变形物体操作方法（如绳子和布料）通常需要数百个真实世界演示来训练每个物体的操作策略，这限制了它们在不断变化的世界中的应用。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了GenDOM，这是一个框架，允许操作策略只需一个真实世界演示来处理不同的可变形物体。为了实现这一点，我们通过将操作策略与可变形物体参数联系起来，并使用多样化的模拟可变形物体对其进行训练，使策略能够根据不同的物体参数调整动作。在推理时，给定一个新的物体，GenDOM可以通过最小化真实世界演示和模拟之间点云的格密度差异来估计可变形物体参数，而只需一个真实世界演示。",
