    "translated_abstract": "文本到图像扩散模型，例如稳定扩散（SD），最近展现出高质量内容生成的显著能力，并成为近期变革性人工智能浪潮的代表之一。然而，这种进步也带来了对该生成技术滥用的日益关注，特别是用于生成受版权保护或不适合在工作环境中查看的图像。虽然已经做出了一些努力来通过模型微调来过滤不适当的图像/提示或删除不希望的概念/风格，但这些安全机制对于多样化的问题提示的可靠性仍然不清楚。在这项工作中，我们提出了Prompting4Debugging（P4D）作为一个调试和红队测试工具，它可以自动找到扩散模型的问题提示，以测试部署的安全机制的可靠性。我们展示了我们的P4D工具在发现具有安全机制的SD模型的新漏洞方面的有效性。具体而言，我们的结果显示...",
