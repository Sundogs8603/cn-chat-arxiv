    "translated_abstract": "在LHCb中，详细的探测器模拟是CPU资源的主要消耗者，在CERN的大型强子对撞机第二阶段运行期间，已经使用了总计超过90％的计算预算。随着LHCb探测器在LHC的第三阶段运行期间收集数据，需要更大规模的模拟数据样本，并且即使存在快速模拟选项，这些需求也将远远超过实验的承诺资源。为了满足分析需求以解释信号与背景以及测量效率的未来需求，必须发展技术和技巧来产生模拟样本。在这种背景下，我们提出了Lamarr，这是一个基于Gaudi的框架，旨在提供最快速的LHCb探测器模拟解决方案。Lamarr由一系列模块组成，这些模块对LHCb实验的探测器响应和重建算法进行参数化。大部分参数化都采用了深度生成模型和梯度提升决策树进行训练。",
