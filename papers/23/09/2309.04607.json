    "translated_abstract": "随着时间的推移，已经开发出了大量的症状清单来衡量临床症状，但这种多样性导致了几个长期存在的问题。最显著的是，来自不同环境和研究的结果不可比较，这限制了可重复性。在这里，我们提出了一种使用语义文本相似性（Semantic Textual Similarity，STS）来链接先前不相容的症状清单中的症状和评分的人工智能（AI）方法。我们测试了四个预训练的STS模型的能力，对来自16个国际数据源的6,607名参与者的四个不同清单中的数千个症状描述对进行相关内容的筛查 - 这通常是一个需要专家小组的具有挑战性的任务。模型的任务是预测六项任务中的四个不同清单中的症状严重程度。STS方法在五个任务中达到了74.8%的准确率，胜过了其他被测试的模型。这项工作表明，结合语境和语义信息可以帮助专家决策过程，从而产生收益。",
