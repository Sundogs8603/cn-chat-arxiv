    "translated_abstract": "当科学家观察世界并试图提出解释这些观察结果的假设时，假设归纳被认为是主要的推理类型。过去关于假设归纳的研究存在以下限制：（1）数据集的观察注释不是原始的网络语料库，而是手动选择的句子（导致了一个封闭领域的设置）；（2）实际的假设注释主要是常识知识，使得任务不太具有挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了第一个用于社会科学学术假设发现的自然语言处理数据集，包含50篇发表在顶级社会科学期刊上的最新论文。数据集中还收集了开发论文中的假设所需的原始网络语料库，最终目标是创建一个系统，仅通过一堆原始网络语料库就可以自动生成有效、新颖且对人类研究者有帮助的假设。这个新数据集可以解决以前关于假设归纳的研究所面临的限制问题。",
