    "translated_abstract": "计算机决策系统广泛应用于自动化处理生活中的许多决策，其中包括敏感领域，如招聘、贷款甚至刑罚。决策流程严重依赖于大量历史现实世界数据来训练模型。然而，历史训练数据经常包含性别、种族或其他偏见，这些偏见会传播到训练模型中，并影响计算机决策。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种强大的方法，可以在最大程度保留分类效用的同时，确保消除不想要的偏见。我们的方法可以以与模型无关的方式始终实现这一目标，通过从现实世界数据中衍生出唯一编码人口平衡和真实性的渐进数据集。作为一个原则性的证明，我们从公共普查记录中推导出这样一个渐进数据集，可以生成合成样本来训练成熟的分类器。对这些分类器的泛化能力进行基准测试。",
