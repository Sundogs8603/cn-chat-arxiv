    "translated_abstract": "在表示学习中，回归问题传统上比分类问题受到的关注较少。直接应用为分类设计的表示学习技术到回归问题往往会导致潜空间中碎片化的表示，从而产生次优的性能。本文认为，由于忽视了两个关键方面：序序感知和难度，对于回归问题而言，对比学习的潜能被忽视了。为了解决这些挑战，我们提倡“混合自己的对比对进行监督性对比回归”，而不仅仅依靠真实/增强样本。具体来说，我们提出了混合式监督对比回归学习（SupReMix）。它在嵌入级别上以锚点包含的混合（锚点和一个不同的负样本的混合）作为困难负对，以锚点排除的混合（两个不同的负样本的混合）作为困难正对。这一策略形成了困难样本对学习的方式。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种名为SupReMix的方法，通过混合样本，特别是混合负样本和混合正样本，来解决回归问题中表示学习的挑战。这种方法能够提供更好的性能和更准确的回归结果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a method called SupReMix that tackles the challenges of representation learning in regression problems by mixing samples, especially mixing negative and positive samples. This method can provide better performance and more accurate regression results."
