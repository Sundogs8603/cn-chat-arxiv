    "abstract": "This paper introduces non-linear dimension reduction in factor-augmented vector autoregressions to analyze the effects of different economic shocks. I argue that controlling for non-linearities between a large-dimensional dataset and the latent factors is particularly useful during turbulent times of the business cycle. In simulations, I show that non-linear dimension reduction techniques yield good forecasting performance, especially when data is highly volatile. In an empirical application, I identify a monetary policy as well as an uncertainty shock excluding and including observations of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those two applications suggest that the non-linear FAVAR approaches are capable of dealing with the large outliers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and yield reliable results in both scenarios.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文将非线性维度降低方法引入因子扩展向量自回归模型，分析不同经济冲击的影响。作者认为在经济周期动荡时，控制大维度数据集与潜在因子之间的非线性关系尤为有用。通过模拟实验证明，非线性维度降低技术在数据高度波动时具有良好的预测性能。在实证应用中，本文排除和包含COVID-19疫情观测，确定了货币政策和不确定性冲击。这两个应用表明非线性FAVAR方法能够处理COVID-19疫情引起的极大离群值，并在两种情景下获得可靠结果。",
