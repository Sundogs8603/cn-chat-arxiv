    "translated_abstract": "图结构化数据在现实世界中广泛存在和应用，但有效地处理这些多样化的数据和在图上进行学习任务是一项挑战。面对复杂的图学习任务，专家们在近年来设计了各种图神经网络（GNN）。他们还实施了图中的自动机器学习，也称为AutoGraph，以自动生成数据特定的解决方案。尽管取得了成功，但他们在以下方面存在限制：（1）在不同层级上管理各种学习任务，（2）处理图学习中不同的流程（超过架构设计），以及（3）使用AutoGraph时对先验知识的巨大需求。本文中，我们提出使用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为自主代理来简化多样化的现实世界图中的学习过程。具体来说，针对用户请求（该请求可能包含节点、边缘或图级别的不同数据和学习目标），复杂图中的学习过程将由LLM自主代理机制来处理。",
