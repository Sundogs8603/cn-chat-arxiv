    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）在多智能体系统的自动化任务解决中取得了显著进展。然而，大多数现有基于LLM的多智能体方法依赖于预定义的代理来处理简单任务，限制了多智能体协作在不同场景中的适应性。因此，我们引入了AutoAgents，一个创新的框架，根据不同任务自适应生成和协调多个专业代理以构建AI团队。具体而言，AutoAgents通过动态生成多个所需代理来耦合任务和角色之间的关系，并且根据生成的专家代理为当前任务规划解决方案。多个专业代理相互协作以高效完成任务。同时，观察者角色被纳入框架中以反思指定的计划和代理的响应，并对其进行改进。我们对多种基准测试进行的实验表明，AutoAgents能够根据不同的任务适应性生成和协调多个专业代理，实现高效的任务完成。",
