    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种通过将数据集的最佳高斯簇分组成统计可分离的超簇的算法。算法包括三个阶段：将数据集表示为高斯混合分布-簇，其数量基于BIC准则的最小值确定；使用马氏距离估计簇之间的距离和簇的大小；使用DBSCAN方法将得到的簇组合成超簇，通过找到其超参数（最大距离）在最大数量的超簇情况下，提供引入的矩阵质量准则的最大值。矩阵质量准则对应于所有发现的超簇中具有统计显著分离的超簇所占比例。该算法只有一个超参数-统计显著性水平，并且可以自动为其选择合适的值。",

    "en_tdlr": "A clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper, which achieves superclustering by grouping statistically significant separable optimal Gaussian clusters. The algorithm consists of three stages: representing the dataset as a mixture of Gaussian distributions, estimating distances and sizes of clusters using Mahalanobis distance, and combining clusters into superclusters. The innovation lies in introducing a matrix quality criterion to determine the optimal number of superclusters by automatically selecting the appropriate statistical significance level."
