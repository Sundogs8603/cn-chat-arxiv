    "abstract": "As social media becomes increasingly popular, more and more activities related to public health emerge. Current techniques for public health analysis involve popular models such as BERT and large language models (LLMs). However, the costs of training in-domain LLMs for public health are especially expensive. Furthermore, such kinds of in-domain datasets from social media are generally imbalanced. To tackle these challenges, the data imbalance issue can be overcome by data augmentation and balanced training. Moreover, the ability of the LLMs can be effectively utilized by prompting the model properly. In this paper, a novel ALEX framework is proposed to improve the performance of public health analysis on social media by adopting an LLMs explanation mechanism. Results show that our ALEX model got the best performance among all submissions in both Task 2 and Task 4 with a high score in Task 1 in Social Media Mining for Health 2023 (SMM4H)[1].

    "translated_abstract": "随着社交媒体的普及，与公共卫生相关的活动也越来越多。目前的公共卫生分析技术涉及到流行的模型，如BERT和大型语言模型（LLMs）。然而，为公共卫生域训练LLMs的成本尤其昂贵。此外，社交媒体中这种域内数据集往往存在不平衡的问题。为应对这些挑战，可以通过数据增强和平衡训练来解决数据不平衡的问题。此外，可以通过适当设置模型的引导方式有效利用LLMs的能力。本文提出了一种新颖的ALEX框架，通过采用LLMs解释机制来提高社交媒体上的公共卫生分析性能。结果显示，我们的ALEX模型在Social Media Mining for Health 2023 （SMM4H）的任务2和任务4中获得了最佳性能，并在任务1中得到了较高的评分[1]。我们的代码已在 https:/ /github 上发布。",
