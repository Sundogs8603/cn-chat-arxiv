    "abstract": "Precise answers are extracted from a text for a given input question in a question answering system. Marathi question answering system is created in recent studies by using ontology, rule base and machine learning based approaches. Recently transformer models and transfer learning approaches are used to solve question answering challenges. In this paper we investigate different transformer models for creating a reading comprehension-based Marathi question answering system. We have experimented on different pretrained Marathi language multilingual and monolingual models like Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages (MuRIL), MahaBERT, Indic Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (IndicBERT) and fine-tuned it on a Marathi reading comprehension-based data set. We got the best accuracy in a MuRIL multilingual model with an EM score of 0.64 and F1 score of 0.74 by fine tuning the model on the Marathi dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "在问答系统中，通过使用本体、规则和基于机器学习的方法，从文本中为给定的问题提取出精确的答案。最近的研究通过使用Transformer模型和迁移学习方法来解决问答挑战，在马拉地语问答系统中取得了一定的成果。本文研究了不同的Transformer模型，用于创建基于阅读理解的马拉地语问答系统。我们在不同的预训练马拉地语多语种和单语种模型上进行了实验，如MuRIL、MahaBERT、IndicBERT，并在马拉地语阅读理解数据集上进行了微调。我们通过在马拉地语数据集上微调MuRIL多语种模型，在EM得分为0.64，F1得分为0.74时获得了最佳准确率。",
