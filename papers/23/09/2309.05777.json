    "translated_abstract": "检测由认知缺陷引起的日常功能微妙缺陷对早期发现神经退行性疾病，尤其是阿尔茨海默病，非常重要。然而，当前日常功能评估的标准基于定性的主观评级。已经证明，语音提供了良好的客观标记来评估认知缺陷，但与认知相关的日常功能的关联尚未得到研究。在这项研究中，我们展示了利用基于智能手表的应用程序收集声学特征作为检测日常功能缺陷的客观标记的可行性。我们从54名老年人中收集了在执行认知任务和日常对话中的语音数据，作为可能的应用场景，并对日常功能进行了测量。使用声学特征的机器学习模型可以以高达77.8%的准确率检测到日常功能缺陷的个体，这比当前标准评估方法要高得多。",
