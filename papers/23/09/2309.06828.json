    "translated_abstract": "磁共振成像（MRI）在脑部疾病诊断中起着关键作用，因此提出了一系列计算机辅助人工智能方法。然而，早期的探索通常集中于一个研究中的有限类型的脑部疾病，并在小规模数据上训练模型，导致泛化的瓶颈。为了更有效和可扩展的范例，我们提出了一种用于通用脑部MRI诊断的分层知识增强预训练框架，称为UniBrain。具体而言，UniBrain利用了一个包含24,770个图像-报告配对的大规模数据集进行常规诊断。不同于先前用于单一视觉或文本特征的预训练技术，或者通过视觉和语言信息之间的蛮力对齐，我们利用不同粒度的报告信息的独特特征构建了一种分层对齐机制，从而增强了特征学习的效率。",
