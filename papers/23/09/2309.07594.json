    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统帮助用户找到与他们相关的物品。现有的推荐模型主要基于预测用户和物品之间的关系，并使用复杂的匹配模型或引入大量的外部信息来捕捉数据中的关联模式。然而，推荐不仅是一个利用数据进行归纳统计的问题，也是一个基于从信息中提取的知识进行推理决策的认知任务。因此，在推荐任务中，逻辑系统自然可以用于推理。然而，虽然基于逻辑系统的硬规则方法可以提供强大的推理能力，但它们在处理不一致和不完整的现实任务中很难应对，尤其是对于复杂任务如推荐。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一个神经符号推荐模型，将用户历史交互转化为逻辑表达式，然后将推荐过程变换为逻辑查询。",
