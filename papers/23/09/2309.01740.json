    "translated_abstract": "大流行导致了包括医学检查增加在内的大量非结构化数据，包括放射学报告。尽管与计算机断层扫描（CT）相比，X射线图像的精确度较低，但以往关于 COVID-19 的自动诊断研究主要集中在 X射线图像上。在本研究中，我们利用医院的非结构化数据，利用 CT 扫描提供的细节进行基于对比性视觉语言学习的零样本多标签分类。与人类专家合作，我们调查了多种零样本模型的有效性，以帮助放射科医生检测肺栓塞，并识别诸如地玻璃状浑浊和实变等细微的肺部细节。我们的实证分析提供了目前在医学多模态预训练文献中被忽视的解决这些细粒度任务的可能方案。我们的研究为医学图像分析领域的未来发展带来了希望。",
