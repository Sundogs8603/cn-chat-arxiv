    "abstract": "We present Clinical Prediction with Large Language Models (CPLLM), a method that involves fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) for clinical disease prediction. We utilized quantization and fine-tuned the LLM using prompts, with the task of predicting whether patients will be diagnosed with a target disease during their next visit or in the subsequent diagnosis, leveraging their historical diagnosis records. We compared our results versus various baselines, including Logistic Regression, RETAIN, and Med-BERT, which is the current state-of-the-art model for disease prediction using structured EHR data. Our experiments have shown that CPLLM surpasses all the tested models in terms of both PR-AUC and ROC-AUC metrics, displaying noteworthy enhancements compared to the baseline models.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种使用大规模语言模型 (LLM) 进行临床疾病预测的方法，该方法包括对预训练的语言模型进行微调。我们利用量化和提示来微调LLM，任务是预测患者在下一次就诊或随后的诊断中是否会被诊断为目标疾病，并利用他们的历史诊断记录。我们将结果与多个基线模型进行了比较，包括逻辑回归、RETAIN和Med-BERT，后者是使用结构化电子病历数据进行疾病预测的当前最先进模型。实验结果显示，CPLLM在PR-AUC和ROC-AUC指标上均超过了所有测试模型，相比基线模型显示出显著的改进。",
