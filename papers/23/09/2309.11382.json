    "translated_abstract": "视觉语言导航（VLN）是一项需要包括理解、感知和规划在内的广泛技能的任务。对于这样一个多方面的挑战，先前的VLN方法完全依赖于一个模型自己的思考在一个回合内进行预测。然而，现有的模型，甚至是最先进的大型语言模型GPT4，仍然难以通过单回合自我思考来处理多个任务。在这项工作中，我们从专家咨询会议中得到灵感，引入了一种新颖的零射击VLN框架。在这个框架中，具有不同能力的大型模型被作为领域专家。我们提出的导航代理DiscussNav可以在每一步之前与这些专家积极讨论，收集必要的信息再行动。这些讨论涵盖了关键的导航子任务，如指令理解、环境感知和完成估计。通过综合实验，我们证明讨论可以显著提高VLN的性能，尤其是在需要多方面决策的情况下。",
