    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT的引入引起了人工智能（AI）自然语言处理（NLP）的关注。ChatGPT的采用率呈指数增长，数百万用户在各种任务和应用领域中进行实验，并取得了令人瞩目的结果。然而，ChatGPT存在着限制和错觉，例如产生看似可信但完全错误的答案。评估ChatGPT和类似的AI工具的性能是一个复杂的问题，正从不同的视角进行探索。在这项工作中，我们通过ChatWords，一个自动化测试系统，为评估ChatGPT对任意单词集的知识做出了贡献。ChatWords设计为可扩展、易于使用和适应性强，也可以评估其他NLP AI工具。ChatWords已公开可用，其主要目标是促进对AI工具的词汇知识的研究。通过两个案例研究，证明了ChatWords的好处：评估对AI工具的知识。",
