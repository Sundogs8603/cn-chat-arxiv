    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection is a complex task, and the principle of \"divide and conquer\" is often regarded as an effective approach to tackling intricate issues. It's noteworthy that recent methods in video anomaly detection have revealed the application of the divide and conquer philosophy (albeit with distinct perspectives from traditional usage), yielding impressive outcomes. This paper systematically reviews these literatures from six dimensions, aiming to enhance the use of the divide and conquer strategy in video anomaly detection. Furthermore, based on the insights gained from this review, a novel approach is presented, which integrates human skeletal frameworks with video data analysis techniques. This method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset, surpassing all existing advanced methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "视频异常检测是一项复杂任务，而“分而治之”的原则通常被认为是解决复杂问题的有效方法。最近的视频异常检测方法揭示了分而治之理念的应用（尽管与传统用法有所不同），取得了令人印象深刻的成果。本文从六个维度系统地回顾了这些文献，旨在提升在视频异常检测中使用分而治之策略的效果。此外，基于从这个综述中获得的见解，提出了一种新颖的方法，将人体骨骼框架与视频数据分析技术相结合。该方法在ShanghaiTech数据集上取得了最先进的性能，超过了所有现有的高级方法。",
