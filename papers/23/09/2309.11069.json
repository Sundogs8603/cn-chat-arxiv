Dynamic Tiling starts with non-overlapping tiles for initial detections and utilizes dynamic overlapping rates along with a tile minimizer. This dual approach effectively resolves fragmented objects, improves detection accuracy, and minimizes computational overhead by reducing the number of forward passes through the object detection model. Adaptable to a variety of operational environments, our method negates the need for laborious recalibration.

Overall, Dynamic Tiling outperforms existing model-agnostic uniform cropping methods, setting new benchmarks for efficiency and accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了动态平铺方法，这是一种模型无关、自适应和可扩展的小物体检测方法，以我们的推理数据中心化哲学为基础。动态平铺从非重叠的平铺开始进行初始检测，并利用动态重叠率和平铺缩小器。这种双重方法有效地解决了碎片化的物体，提高了检测准确性，并通过减少对物体检测模型的正向传递次数来减小计算开销。适用于各种操作环境，我们的方法消除了繁琐的重新校准的需求。此外，我们的大小过滤机制提高了不同大小物体的检测质量。总体而言，动态平铺优于现有的模型无关均匀裁剪方法，为效率和准确性设立了新的基准。",
