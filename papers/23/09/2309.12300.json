    "translated_abstract": "为了实现人类擅长的精确、富有接触、灵巧的操作，为多指机器人配备触觉传感至关重要。然而，仅依靠触觉传感无法提供足够的线索来推理物体的空间配置，从而限制了纠正错误和适应变化情况的能力。本文提出了一种新的框架——通过视觉激励实现触觉适应（TAVI），通过使用基于视觉奖励的优化触觉策略来增强基于触觉的灵巧性。首先，我们使用对比性目标来学习视觉表示。接下来，我们利用这些视觉表示通过基于最优传输匹配的方式构建奖励函数，其中参考一个人类示范。最后，我们利用在线强化学习来优化机器人上基于触觉的策略，以最大化视觉奖励。在六个具有挑战性的任务中，如插销拿取、卸下碗和翻转细长物体等，TAVI取得了不错的成绩。",
