    "translated_abstract": "重建不稳定的重粒子需要精密的技术来筛选出将探测器物体分配给底层粒子的大量可能排列。一种基于广义注意机制的方法，称为对称保持注意力网络 (Spa-Net)，先前已应用于只产生强子喷注的大型强子对撞机中的顶夸克对衰变。在这里，我们扩展了 Spa-Net 架构来考虑多种输入物体类型，如轻子，以及全局事件特征，如失去的横向动量。此外，我们提供回归和分类输出以补充粒子分配。我们在顶夸克对的半轻子衰变以及与希格斯玻色子共同产生的顶夸克对的背景下探讨了 Spa-Net 扩展能力的性能。我们发现在三个代表性研究的能力方面有显著的改进：ttH 搜索、顶夸克对的测量等等。",
