Upon combination of msBNN and corrected Lewis-mode group contribution method (cLGC), different optical properties of molecules are afforded accurately and efficiently - by using only a small data set for training. Moreover, by employing the EA model designed specifically for LGC, structural search is well achievable. The logical origins of the well performance of the framework are discussed in detail.
