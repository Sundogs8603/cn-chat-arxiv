    "translated_abstract": "为了实现碳中和、无净损失生物多样性和地球福祉，需要对我们的生产和消费习惯进行转型性变革。组织是我们人类组织日常生活的方式，我们的负面环境影响，也称为碳和生物多样性足迹，大部分是由组织引起的。本文展示了如何利用任何组织的财务报表来开发一个综合的碳和生物多样性足迹账户。作为度量标准，我们利用了空间明确的潜在全球物种损失，我们认为这可以理解为生物多样性的等效指标，对于生物多样性来说，其效用类似于对气候来说的二氧化碳等效指标。我们提供了一个全球生物多样性足迹数据库，组织、专家和研究人员可以使用该数据库来评估基于消费的生物多样性足迹。我们还认为，当前财务和环境指标的整合有待进一步完善。",
