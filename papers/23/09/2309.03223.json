    "abstract": "One of the most common things that a genealogist is tasked with is the gathering of a person's initial family history, normally via in-person interviews or with the use of a platform such as ancestry.com, as this can provide a strong foundation upon which a genealogist may build. However, the ability to conduct these interviews can often be hindered by both geographical constraints and the technical proficiency of the interviewee, as the interviewee in these types of interviews is most often an elderly person with a lower than average level of technical proficiency. With this in mind, this study presents what we believe, based on prior research, to be the first chatbot geared entirely towards the gathering of family histories, and explores the viability of utilising such a chatbot by comparing the performance and usability of such a method with the aforementioned alternatives. With a chatbot-based approach, we show that, though the average time taken to conduct an interview may be long",

    "translated_abstract": "一个家谱学家常常要做的事情之一就是通过面对面采访或使用诸如ancestry.com之类的平台收集一个人的家族历史，因为这可以为家谱学家打下坚实的基础。然而，进行这些采访的能力往往受到地理位置限制和被采访者的技术能力的影响，因为在这些类型的采访中，被采访者通常是一个年长且技术能力低于平均水平的人。基于这一点，本研究提出了据我们基于先前的研究相信是第一个完全面向家族历史收集的聊天机器人，并通过与上述替代方案的性能和可用性进行比较来探索利用这种聊天机器人的可行性。通过聊天机器人的方法，我们展示了尽管进行采访的平均时间可能较长，",

The research shows that the chatbot method overcomes geographical and technical constraints, although it may result in longer interview times."
