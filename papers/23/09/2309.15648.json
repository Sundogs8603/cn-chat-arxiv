    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于生成建模的最新突破，合成图生成器（SGGs）的话题受到了很多关注。然而，许多最先进的SGGs在图的大小方面不具有良好的可扩展性。事实上，在生成过程中，通常需要考虑固定节点数的所有可能边，这会以$\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$的规模增长，其中$N$是图中的节点数。因此，许多最先进的SGGs不适用于大型图。本文介绍了SANGEA，这是一个可扩展的合成图生成框架，它将任何SGG的适用范围扩展到大型图。通过首先将大图分成社区，SANGEA对每个社区训练一个SGG，然后将社区图链接在一起，创建一个合成的大图。我们的实验证明，SANGEA生成的图在拓扑和节点特征分布方面与原始图非常相似。此外，这些生成的图具有良好的可扩展性和属性。",
