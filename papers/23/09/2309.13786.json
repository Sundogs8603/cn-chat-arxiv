Previous work has focused mainly on bounding either the expected loss of a predictor or the probability that an individual prediction will incur a loss value in a specified range. However, for many high-stakes applications, it is crucial to understand and control the dispersion of a loss distribution, or the extent to which different members of a population experience unequal effects of algorithmic decisions. We initiate the study of distribution-free control of statistical dispersion measures with societal implications and propose a simple yet flexible framework that allows us to handle a much richer class of statistical functionals beyond previous work.

    "translated_abstract": "在负责任的机器学习中，对模型性能的显式有限样本统计保证是一个重要因素。之前的研究主要关注于界定预测器的期望损失或者个体预测将承受的损失值在一个指定范围内的概率。然而，对于许多高风险应用而言，理解和控制损失分布的离散度，或者说人群中不同个体对算法决策的影响程度是至关重要的。我们开始研究具有社会意义的无分布统计离散度控制，并提出了一个简单但灵活的框架，可以处理比以前的工作更丰富的统计功能类。我们通过在有毒评论检测、医学影像和电影推荐等实验中验证了我们的方法。",
