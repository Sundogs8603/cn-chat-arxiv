    "abstract": "In this work, we propose an error correction framework, named DiaCorrect, to refine the output of a diarization system in a simple yet effective way. This method is inspired by error correction techniques in automatic speech recognition. Our model consists of two parallel convolutional encoders and a transform-based decoder. By exploiting the interactions between the input recording and the initial system's outputs, DiaCorrect can automatically correct the initial speaker activities to minimize the diarization errors. Experiments on 2-speaker telephony data show that the proposed DiaCorrect can effectively improve the initial model's results.
