In this work, we propose a semi-automatic technique to extract these explanations from a large parallel corpus.

    "translated_abstract": "在机器翻译中，一个常见问题是某些词的翻译即使翻译了也会因为不同的文化背景导致目标语言观众无法理解。解决这个问题的方法是为这些词添加解释。在第一步中，我们需要识别这些词或短语。在这项工作中，我们探索了从平行语料库中提取示例解释的技术。然而，包含需要解释的词的句子的稀缺性使得构建训练数据集极其困难。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种半自动技术，可以从大型平行语料库中提取这些解释。在英语->德语语言对上的实验表明，我们的方法能够提取出超过10%的句子包含解释，而原始句子中只有1.9%包含解释。此外，在英语->法语和英语->中文语言对上的实验也显示出类似的结果。",
