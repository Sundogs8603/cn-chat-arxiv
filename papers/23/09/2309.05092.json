This is made possible by a precise characterization of the effective coverage inflation (or deflation) suffered by standard conformal inferences in the presence of label contamination, which is then made actionable through new calibration algorithms. Our solution is flexible and can leverage different modeling assumptions about the label contamination process, while requiring no knowledge of the underlying data distribution or of the inner workings of the machine-learning classifier. The advantages of the proposed methods are demonstrated through extensive simulations and an application to object classification with the CIFAR-10H image data set.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文开发了新颖的符合预测方法，用于分类任务，能够自动适应在校准样本中的随机标签污染，从而产生更丰富的、比起最先进方法更有强大覆盖保证的预测集。这是通过精确表征标准符合推断在标签污染存在时受到的有效覆盖膨胀（或紧缩）来实现的，然后通过新的校准算法来实现可行性。我们的解决方案是灵活的，可以利用关于标签污染过程的不同建模假设，同时不需要对底层数据分布或机器学习分类器的内部工作原理进行了解。所提出方法的优势通过广泛的模拟和对CIFAR-10H图像数据集的物体分类应用得到展示。",
