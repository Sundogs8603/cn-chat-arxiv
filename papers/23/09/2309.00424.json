    "abstract": "For fine-grained generation and recognition tasks such as minimally-supervised text-to-speech (TTS), voice conversion (VC), and automatic speech recognition (ASR), the intermediate representation extracted from speech should contain information that is between text coding and acoustic coding. The linguistic content is salient, while the paralinguistic information such as speaker identity and acoustic details should be removed. However, existing methods for extracting fine-grained intermediate representations from speech suffer from issues of excessive redundancy and dimension explosion. Additionally, existing contrastive learning methods in the audio field focus on extracting global descriptive information for downstream audio classification tasks, making them unsuitable for TTS, VC, and ASR tasks. To address these issues, we propose a method named Contrastive Phoneme-Speech Pretraining (CPSP), which uses three encoders, one decoder, and contrastive learning to bring phoneme and speech",

    "translated_abstract": "对于诸如最小监督的文本转语音（TTS）、语音转换（VC）和自动语音识别（ASR）等细粒度生成和识别任务，从语音中提取的中间表示应包含介于文本编码和声学编码之间的信息。语言内容突出，而发言人身份和声学细节等语音信息应该被去除。然而，现有的从语音中提取细粒度中间表示的方法存在冗余性过高和维度爆炸的问题。此外，音频领域中现有的对比学习方法主要关注提取用于下游音频分类任务的全局描述信息，不适合TTS、VC和ASR任务。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种名为对比音素-语音预训练（CPSP）的方法，该方法使用三个编码器、一个解码器和对比学习来将音素和语音信息相结合。",
