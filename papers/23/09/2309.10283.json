    "abstract": "Machine Unlearning is an emerging field that addresses data privacy issues by enabling the removal of private or irrelevant data from the Machine Learning process. Challenges related to privacy and model efficiency arise from the use of outdated, private, and irrelevant data. These issues compromise both the accuracy and the computational efficiency of models in both Machine Learning and Unlearning. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a novel framework, Attention-based Machine Unlearning using Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRAMU). This framework incorporates adaptive learning mechanisms, privacy preservation techniques, and optimization strategies, making it a well-rounded solution for handling various data sources, either single-modality or multi-modality, while maintaining accuracy and privacy. FRAMU's strength lies in its adaptability to fluctuating data landscapes, its ability to unlearn outdated, private, or irrelevant data, and its support for continual model evolution",

    "translated_abstract": "机器遗忘是一个新兴领域，通过允许从机器学习过程中删除私有或无关数据，解决数据隐私问题。使用过时的、私有的和无关的数据会引发与隐私和模型效率相关的挑战。这些问题不仅影响模型在机器学习和遗忘中的准确性和计算效率，还会对数据隐私造成威胁。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了一种新颖的框架，即基于注意力的联邦强化学习机器遗忘（FRAMU）。该框架融合了自适应学习机制、隐私保护技术和优化策略，是处理各种数据源（单模态或多模态）同时保持准确性和隐私性的综合解决方案。FRAMU的优势在于其适应波动的数据环境、遗忘过时、私有或无关数据的能力，以及支持模型持续演进的支持。",
