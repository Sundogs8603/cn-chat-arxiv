    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了社会知识积累过程，其中新知识单元的有效性既取决于其推导的正确性，又取决于它所依赖的单元的有效性。在这种情境中的一个基本问题是：如果新推导的恒定比例是错误的，那么投入一个恒定比例并远离一的努力是否能确保社会中的知识的一个恒定比例是有效的？Ben-Eliezer, Mikulincer, Mossel和Sudan (ITCS 2023)引入了一个具体的概率模型来分析这类问题，并对这个问题作出了肯定的回答。然而，他们的研究集中于一个简单情况，即每个新单元只依赖于一个现有单元，并且单元根据$\\textit{优先附加规则}$附加。在这项工作中，我们考虑了更一般的累积知识过程家族，其中新单元可能根据不同的附加机制进行附加。",
