    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在研究在动态离散时间设置中由畸变函数生成的风险度量，并研究相应的动态一致可接受指数(DCAIs)。首先我们证明了Choquet积分的条件版本确实是动态一致风险度量(DCRMs)，并引入了动态加权风险度量的类。我们证明了这两类风险度量是一致的。在动态一致可接受指数的鲁棒表示定理的精神下，我们建立了由畸变函数生成的动态一致风险度量族的一些相关性质，并定义和研究了相应的DCAIs。其次，我们研究了由畸变函数生成的动态一致风险度量和DCAIs的时一致性。特别地，我们证明了这样的DCRMs是次马丁格尔时一致的，但不是超马丁格尔时一致的。我们还证明了由畸变函数生成的DCRMs并不是弱接受时一致的。",
