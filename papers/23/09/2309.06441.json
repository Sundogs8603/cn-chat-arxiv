For example, meshes are generally not suitable for modeling clothing and hair. Motivated by this, we present Disentangled Avatars~(DELTA), which models humans with hybrid explicit-implicit 3D representations.

    "translated_abstract": "为了学习动画化和逼真的人体角色，人们做出了巨大的努力。为了对整个人体（例如身体、服装、面部和头发）进行整体建模和捕捉，已经对显式和隐式的3D表示进行了大量研究，但是这些表示都不是在表示效果方面的最佳选择，因为人体角色的不同部分具有不同的建模要求。例如，网格通常不适合模拟服装和头发。出于这个原因，我们提出了Disentangled Avatars（DELTA），它使用混合的显式-隐式3D表示对人体进行建模。DELTA以单目RGB视频为输入，并生成具有分开身体和服装/头发层的虚拟人体角色。具体来说，我们展示了DELTA的两个重要应用。第一个应用考虑了人体和服装的解耦，第二个应用考虑了面部和头发的解耦。为了实现这个目标，DELTA对身体或面部进行表示。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种名为DELTA的方法，使用混合的显式-隐式3D表示对人体进行解耦合建模。通过将人体或面部表示为分开的层，DELTA能够实现人体和服装/头发的解耦。这种方法在学习可动画和逼真的人体角色方面具有潜力。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method called DELTA, which uses a hybrid explicit-implicit 3D representation to disentangle and model the human body. By representing the body or face as separate layers, DELTA is able to achieve disentanglement between the body and clothing/hair. This approach shows potential in learning animatable and photorealistic human avatars."
