    "abstract": "Conditional GANs are frequently used for manipulating the attributes of face images, such as expression, hairstyle, pose, or age. Even though the state-of-the-art models successfully modify the requested attributes, they simultaneously modify other important characteristics of the image, such as a person's identity. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem by introducing PluGeN4Faces, a plugin to StyleGAN, which explicitly disentangles face attributes from a person's identity. Our key idea is to perform training on images retrieved from movie frames, where a given person appears in various poses and with different attributes. By applying a type of contrastive loss, we encourage the model to group images of the same person in similar regions of latent space. Our experiments demonstrate that the modifications of face attributes performed by PluGeN4Faces are significantly less invasive on the remaining characteristics of the image than in the existing state-of-the-art models.",

    "translated_abstract": "有条件的生成对抗网络经常用于操纵面部图像的属性，如表情、发型、姿势或年龄。尽管最先进的模型成功地修改了请求的属性，但同时也修改了图像的其他重要特征，如一个人的身份。本文致力于通过引入PluGeN4Faces（一种StyleGAN插件），从人的身份中明确解缠面部属性，来解决这个问题。我们的关键思想是对从电影帧中检索到的图像进行训练，该图像中的同一人以不同的姿势和属性出现。通过应用对比损失的一种类型，我们鼓励模型将同一人的图像分组到潜在空间的相似区域。我们的实验证明，PluGeN4Faces所执行的面部属性修改对图像的其他特征的侵入性明显小于现有的最先进模型。",
