    "abstract": "Motivated by the success of transformers in various fields, such as language understanding and image analysis, this investigation explores their application in the context of the game of Go. In particular, our study focuses on the analysis of the Transformer in Vision. Through a detailed analysis of numerous points such as prediction accuracy, win rates, memory, speed, size, or even learning rate, we have been able to highlight the substantial role that transformers can play in the game of Go. This study was carried out by comparing them to the usual Residual Networks.",
