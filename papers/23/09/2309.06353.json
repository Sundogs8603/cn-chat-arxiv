    "translated_abstract": "印度是世界上最大的民主国家，最近超过中国成为人口最多的国家，估计拥有14.25亿人口（约占世界人口的18%）。此外，印度的老年人口预计到2035年将增加到1.38亿。印度经济已经在政府现有养老金负债的压力下苦苦挣扎。因此，印度引入了全国养老金制度（NPS），这是一项为在2004年1月1日或之后加入政府服务的雇员设立的定义贡献计划，告别了自英国统治以来在印度流行的旧养老金制度（OPS），后者是一种直接福利制度。政府的这一举措是具有划时代意义的，旨在在人们中倡导有纪律的储蓄，同时通过减少中央和邦政府的养老金负债，显著减轻政府负担。本文旨在分析不同的特点。",
