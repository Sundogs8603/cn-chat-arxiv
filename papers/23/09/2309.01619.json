In the present work, we focus on the expectation propagation (EP) approximation of the posterior distribution in Bayesian probit regression under a multivariate Gaussian prior distribution. Adapting more general derivations in Anceschi et al. (2023), we show how to leverage results on the extended multivariate skew-normal distribution to derive an efficient implementation of the EP routine having a per-iteration cost that scales linearly in the number of covariates. This makes EP computationally feasible also in challenging high-dimensional settings, as shown in a detailed simulation study.",
