    "abstract": "Despite the plethora of telehealth applications to assist home-based older adults and healthcare providers, basic messaging and phone calls are still the most common communication methods, which suffer from limited availability, information loss, and process inefficiencies. One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered VA i",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管有大量的远程医疗应用程序来帮助家庭中的老年人和医疗提供者，但基本的消息和电话仍然是最常见的通信方法，这些方法存在有限的可用性、信息丢失和流程效率低下的问题。促进患者-医生通信的一个有希望的解决方案是利用大型语言模型(LLMs)及其强大的自然对话和摘要能力。然而，对于LLMs在通信过程中的作用还存在有限的理解。我们首先进行了两项访谈研究，分别与老年人(N=10)和医疗提供者(N=9)进行了交流，以了解他们在患者-医生异步通信中对LLMs的需求和机会。基于这些见解，我们构建了一个LLM驱动的通信系统Talk2Care，并为两个群体设计了交互组件: (1) 对于老年人，我们利用语音助手的便利性和易于获取性，构建了一个LLM驱动的语音助手",
