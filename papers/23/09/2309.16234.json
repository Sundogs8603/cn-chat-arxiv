This is possible because YouTube has become one of the platforms for people to express themselves, including their opinions on various political figures. The resulting sentiment analysis can be useful for political executives to gain an understanding of public sentiment and develop appropriate and effective political strategies. This study aimed to build a sentiment analysis system leveraging YouTube videos metadata. The sentiment analysis system was built using Apache Kafka, Apache PySpark, and Hadoop for big data handling; TensorFlow for deep learning handling; and FastAPI for deployment on the server.

    "translated_abstract": "可以利用来自YouTube视频元数据的大数据进行情感分析，以分析代表政党的各种政治人物在公众中的观点。这是可能的，因为YouTube已成为人们表达自己观点的平台，包括对各种政治人物的意见。由此产生的情感分析对于政治执行者理解公众情绪并制定适当有效的政治策略很有用。本研究旨在构建利用YouTube视频元数据的情感分析系统。情感分析系统使用Apache Kafka、Apache PySpark和Hadoop进行大数据处理；使用TensorFlow进行深度学习处理；并使用FastAPI在服务器上进行部署。本研究使用的YouTube视频元数据是视频描述。情感分析模型使用LSTM算法构建，并产生两种情感：积极和消极情感。",
