    "abstract": "Simulation of autonomous vehicle systems requires that simulated traffic participants exhibit diverse and realistic behaviors. The use of prerecorded real-world traffic scenarios in simulation ensures realism but the rarity of safety critical events makes large scale collection of driving scenarios expensive. In this paper, we present DJINN - a diffusion based method of generating traffic scenarios. Our approach jointly diffuses the trajectories of all agents, conditioned on a flexible set of state observations from the past, present, or future. On popular trajectory forecasting datasets, we report state of the art performance on joint trajectory metrics. In addition, we demonstrate how DJINN flexibly enables direct test-time sampling from a variety of valuable conditional distributions including goal-based sampling, behavior-class sampling, and scenario editing.",

    "translated_abstract": "模拟自动驾驶系统需要模拟出展现多样和真实行为的交通参与者。在模拟中使用实际世界交通场景确保了真实性，但是安全关键事件的罕见性使得大规模收集驾驶场景具有高昂的成本。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于扩散的生成交通场景的方法DJINN。我们的方法联合扩散所有代理的轨迹，以过去、现在或未来的一系列灵活的状态观察为条件。在流行的轨迹预测数据集上，我们报道了在联合轨迹评估指标上的最先进性能。此外，我们展示了DJINN如何灵活地使得从各种有价值的条件分布中直接进行测试时抽样，包括基于目标的抽样、行为类别抽样和场景编辑。",
