    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种新的神经结构，用于解决视觉抽象推理任务，受人类认知的启发，具体来说是由人类抽象推理通常将感知和概念处理交替进行作为灵活、迭代和动态认知过程的一部分的观察所启发。受此原理的启发，我们的架构将视觉抽象推理建模为一种迭代的、自对比的学习过程，追求视觉刺激的感知和概念处理之间的一致性。我们解释了这个新的对比感知-概念网络（CPCNet）如何通过模拟鸦文进阶矩阵智力测试的矩阵推理问题来工作。在机器学习数据集RAVEN上进行的实验证明，CPCNet在使用最弱的归纳偏置的同时实现了比之前所有已发表模型更高的精度。我们还指出了原始RAVEN数据集中存在的大量且以前没有被注意到的类不平衡问题，并提出了一个新的解决方案。",
