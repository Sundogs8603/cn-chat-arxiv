    "abstract": "Financial portfolio management describes the task of distributing funds and conducting trading operations on a set of financial assets, such as stocks, index funds, foreign exchange or cryptocurrencies, aiming to maximize the profit while minimizing the loss incurred by said operations. Deep Learning (DL) methods have been consistently excelling at various tasks and automated financial trading is one of the most complex one of those. This paper aims to provide insight into various DL methods for financial trading, under both the supervised and reinforcement learning schemes. At the same time, taking into consideration sentiment information regarding the traded assets, we discuss and demonstrate their usefulness through corresponding research studies. Finally, we discuss commonly found problems in training such financial agents and equip the reader with the necessary knowledge to avoid these problems and apply the discussed methods in practice.",

    "translated_abstract": "金融投资组合管理是指在一系列金融资产（如股票、指数基金、外汇或加密货币）上分配资金并进行交易操作的任务，旨在最大化利润同时最小化交易操作所造成的损失。深度学习方法一直以来在各种任务中表现出色，自动化金融交易就是其中最复杂的任务之一。本文旨在提供关于金融交易中各种深度学习方法的见解，分别在监督学习和强化学习框架下进行讨论。同时，考虑到与交易资产相关的情绪信息，我们通过相应的研究研究论证了它们的有用性。最后，我们讨论了训练此类金融智能体中常见的问题，并为读者提供必要的知识，以避免这些问题并将讨论的方法应用于实践中。",
