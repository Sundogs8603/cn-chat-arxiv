    "abstract": "We introduce TurboGP, a Genetic Programming (GP) library fully written in Python and specifically designed for machine learning tasks. TurboGP implements modern features not available in other GP implementations, such as island and cellular population schemes, different types of genetic operations (migration, protected crossovers), online learning, among other features. TurboGP's most distinctive characteristic is its native support for different types of GP nodes to allow different abstraction levels, this makes TurboGP particularly useful for processing a wide variety of data sources.",
