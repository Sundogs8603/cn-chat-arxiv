    "translated_abstract": "过去十年中，半导体制造技术的进展催生了对由激子极化子库伦凝聚驱动的全光学器件的广泛研究。包括晶体管在内的这类器件的初步验证已经在环境条件下取得了鼓舞人心的结果。然而，一个重要的挑战仍然存在于大规模应用领域：缺乏一个健壮的求解器，可以用于模拟需要较长时间达到稳定的复杂非线性系统。为了解决这个需求，我们提出了一种基于机器学习的傅里叶神经算子方法，用于求解与额外激子速率方程耦合的Gross-Pitaevskii方程。这项工作标志着神经算子首次直接应用于激子极化子库伦凝聚系统。我们的研究结果表明，与基于CUDA的GPU求解器相比，所提出的方法可以以接近1000倍的速度准确预测最终状态的解。此外，这为今后的深入研究铺平了道路。",
