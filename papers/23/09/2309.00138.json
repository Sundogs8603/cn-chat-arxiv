    "translated_abstract": "如今，电脑游戏已经广泛普及，受到各个年龄段人们的喜爱。但是对于儿童来说，玩这些游戏不仅仅是一种娱乐，更是他们发展重要技能和建立情感智力的方式。儿童在游戏过程中产生的面部表情和声音反映了他们的情绪、想法和心情。本文提出了一种新颖的框架，通过分析音频和视频数据，集成了模糊方法来识别情感。我们的重点在于儿童专用的游戏环境，旨在提升他们的用户体验。我们使用FER数据集检测从游戏屏幕上记录的视频帧中的面部表情。对于儿童在游戏过程中产生的声音的情感识别，我们使用CREMA-D、TESS、RAVDESS和Savee数据集。接下来，我们使用模糊推理系统来融合结果。除此之外，我们的系统还可以检测情感稳定性和情感多样性。",

It detects facial expressions using the FER dataset, recognizes sound emotions using the CREMA-D, TESS, RAVDESS, and Savee datasets, and fuses the results using a fuzzy inference system. The system is also capable of detecting emotion stability and diversity."
