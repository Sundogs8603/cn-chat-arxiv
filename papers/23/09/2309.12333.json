    "translated_abstract": "本文强调了体育博彩中的去中心化解决了传统中心化平台的缺点，确保了透明度、安全性和较低的费用。非监管解决方案使投注者拥有资金所有权，绕过了地理限制。去中心化平台增强了安全性、隐私性和民主决策。然而，去中心化体育博彩需要自动市场制造者（AMMs）来提供有效的流动性。现有的AMMs如Uniswap缺乏与公平赔率的一致性，给流动性提供者带来了风险。为了缓解这个问题，本文引入了UBET AMM（UAMM），利用智能合约和算法来公平定价体育赔率。它建立了一个链上博彩框架，详细介绍市场创建、UAMM应用、抵押流动性池以及展示积极结果的实验。UAMM通过确保流动性、去中心化定价和全球可访问性来增强去中心化体育博彩，促进无需信任的",
