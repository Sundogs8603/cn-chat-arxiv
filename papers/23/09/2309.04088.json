In particular, agents intermittently communicate state and control signals in robotic network applications, often with limited power over an unlicensed spectrum, prone to eavesdropping and denial-of-service attacks. In this paper, we argue that a widely popular low-power communication protocol known as LoRa is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks by an unauthenticated attacker if it can successfully identify a target signal's bandwidth and spreading factor. Leveraging a structural pattern in the LoRa signal's instantaneous frequency representation, we relate the problem of jointly inferring the two unknown parameters to a classification problem, which can be efficiently implemented using neural networks.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多大规模的分布式多智能体系统通过低功率通信网络交换信息。特别是在机器人网络应用中，代理器以有限的功率在未经许可的频谱上间歇性地通信状态和控制信号，容易受到窃听和拒绝服务攻击。本文指出，一种被广泛使用的低功率通信协议LoRa，如果一个非验证的攻击者能够成功识别目标信号的带宽和扩频因子，就容易受到拒绝服务攻击。利用LoRa信号瞬时频率表示中的结构模式，我们将联合推断这两个未知参数问题与分类问题相关联，可以通过神经网络高效实现。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种基于神经网络的方法，利用LoRa信号的瞬时频率表示中的结构模式，实现了对低功率通信信号的分类。这种方法能够有效抵御非验证攻击者对LoRa协议的拒绝服务攻击。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a neural network-based method that utilizes the structural pattern in the instantaneous frequency representation of LoRa signals to classify low-power communication signals. The proposed method effectively defends against denial-of-service attacks by unauthenticated attackers on the LoRa protocol."
