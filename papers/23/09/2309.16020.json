    "translated_abstract": "全球地理定位旨在确定遥感图像的精确位置。由于地理景观的巨大变化，这项任务面临着巨大的挑战。 基于图像检索的方法无法在全球范围内解决这个问题，因为构建涵盖整个世界的大型图像库是不可行的。 相反，现有方法将全球划分为离散的地理单元，将问题转化为分类任务。 然而，这些方法的性能受到预定义类别的限制，并且当图像的位置与其类别中心显著偏离时，往往导致不准确的定位。 为了克服这些限制，我们提出了GeoCLIP，一种新颖的受Clip启发的图像到GPS检索方法，强制进行图像与其对应的GPS位置之间的对齐。 GeoCLIP的位置编码器通过使用随机傅里叶特征进行位置编码，将地球建模为连续函数。",
