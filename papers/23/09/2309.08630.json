    "translated_abstract": "喷注标记是高能物理实验中的一个分类问题，旨在识别粒子碰撞产生的锥状喷注，并将其标记为发射粒子。喷注标记的进展为超出标准模型的新物理搜索提供了机会。目前的方法使用深度学习在复杂碰撞数据中寻找隐藏的模式。然而，将喷注表示为深度学习模型的输入的方法多种多样，并且通常会向模型隐藏有信息的特征。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种基于图形的喷注表示方法，以尽可能地编码最多的信息。为了从这种表示中最好地学习，我们设计了一种名为Particle Chebyshev Network（PCN）的图神经网络（GNN），并使用切比雪夫图卷积（ChebConv）。ChebConv已经被证明是GNN中的一种有效替代传统图卷积的方法，而在喷注标记中还没有被探索过。PCN取得了显著的改进。",
