    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了使用CNN迁移学习算法对鸡蛋受精进行非破坏性检测，以实现精确的家禽孵化场实践。使用增广图像（旋转、翻转、缩放、平移和反射）对四种模型（VGG16、ResNet50、InceptionNet和MobileNet）进行训练和评估，数据集包括200个单一鸡蛋图像。虽然训练结果显示所有模型均达到了较高的准确度，表明它们能够准确地学习和分类鸡蛋的受精状态，但在测试集上评估时，准确度和性能存在差异。InceptionNet表现出了最佳的整体性能，能够准确地分类可孵化和不可孵化的鸡蛋。在评估指标的所有参数上，在训练集和测试集中都表现出了优异的性能。在测试集中，它实现了0.98的准确度，1的敏感性来检测可孵化的鸡蛋，并以0.96的特异性来识别不可孵化的鸡蛋。",
