    "abstract": "The latest advancements in AI and deep learning have led to a breakthrough in large language model (LLM)-based agents such as GPT-4. However, many commercial conversational agent development tools are pipeline-based and have limitations in holding a human-like conversation. This paper investigates the capabilities of LLMs to enhance pipeline-based conversational agents during two phases: 1) in the design and development phase and 2) during operations. In 1) LLMs can aid in generating training data, extracting entities and synonyms, localization, and persona design. In 2) LLMs can assist in contextualization, intent classification to prevent conversational breakdown and handle out-of-scope questions, auto-correcting utterances, rephrasing responses, formulating disambiguation questions, summarization, and enabling closed question-answering capabilities. We conducted informal experiments with GPT-4 in the private banking domain to demonstrate the scenarios above with a practical example.",

    "translated_abstract": "AI和深度学习的最新进展使得基于大型语言模型（LLM）的代理器（如GPT-4）取得了突破。然而，许多商业化对话系统开发工具是基于流水线的，并且在进行人类对话时存在限制。本文研究了LLM在以下两个阶段中增强基于流水线的对话系统的能力：1）设计和开发阶段；2）运营阶段。在1）中，LLM可以在生成训练数据、提取实体和同义词、本地化和角色设计方面提供帮助。在2）中，LLM可以辅助上下文化、意图分类以防止对话中断和处理超出范围的问题、自动纠正话语、改写回复、制定消歧问句、摘要和使闭合问题回答能力。我们在私人银行领域进行了使用GPT-4的非正式实验，以实际示例证明上述情景。",
