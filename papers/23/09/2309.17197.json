    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，人工智能（AI）模型在使用受保护属性不平衡的数据进行训练时可能会表现出偏见。大部分现有的工作都集中在深度学习模型上，但是利用手工特征的经典人工智能技术也可能受到这种偏见的影响。在本文中，我们研究了使用放射组学特征训练的随机森林（RF）模型中可能存在的种族偏见。我们的应用是利用乳腺癌患者的动态增强磁共振成像（DCE-MRI）预测肿瘤分子亚型。我们的研究结果表明，从DCE-MRI数据中提取的放射组学特征确实包含种族可辨识的信息，并且基于这些数据训练的RF模型可以以60-70％的准确率预测白人和黑人种族，具体取决于所使用的特征子集。此外，基于种族不平衡数据训练的RF模型似乎会产生偏见行为，表现出某种程度的种族偏见。",
