At the purchase time, if customers cannot recognize a brand for which they saw an ad, the money spent on the ad is essentially wasted. Despite its importance in marketing, until now, there has been no study on the memorability of ads in the ML literature. Most studies have been conducted on short-term recall (<5 mins) on specific content types like object and action videos. On the other hand, the advertising industry only cares about long-term memorability (a few hours or longer), and advertisements are almost always highly multimodal, depicting a story through its different modalities (text, images, and videos). With this motivation, we conduct the first large scale memorability study consisting of 1203 participants and 2205 ads covering 276 brands. Running statistical tests over different participant subpopulations and ad-types, we find many interesting insights into what makes an ad memorable - both content and h",

    "translated_abstract": "市场营销人员花费数十亿美元在广告上，但是投入到广告上的金钱能起多大作用呢？当顾客在购买时无法辨认出他们看过的品牌的话，花在广告上的钱基本上就被浪费了。尽管在营销中很重要，但迄今为止，在机器学习的文献中还没有关于广告记忆力的研究。大多数研究都是对特定内容类型（如物体和动作视频）进行短期回忆（<5分钟）的研究。另一方面，广告行业只关心长期记忆（几个小时或更长时间），而且广告几乎总是高度多模式化，通过不同的形式（文本、图像和视频）来讲故事。基于这一动机，我们进行了首个大规模记忆性研究，共有1203名参与者和2205个广告涵盖了276个品牌。在不同参与者子群体和广告类型上进行统计测试，我们发现了许多有关什么使广告难忘的有趣见解-无论是内容还是",
    "tldr": "本研究是首个大规模的记忆性研究，发现广告的长期记忆性对于市场营销非常重要，但在机器学习文献中一直缺乏相关研究。通过分析大量参与者和广告，我们得出了关于什么使广告记忆深刻的有趣见解。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study is the first large scale analysis of long-term memorability for advertisements, which is crucial for marketing but has been lacking research in the machine learning literature. By analyzing a large number of participants and advertisements, we uncover interesting insights into what makes ads memorable."
