    "translated_abstract": "本文的主要目的是推导出在arXiv:2210.15343中介绍的Heston-Hawkes随机波动率模型中单位连结政策的Thiele的微分方程。该模型是著名的Heston模型的扩展，通过在波动率中添加一个复合Hawkes过程，引入了波动率聚类特征。由于该模型是无套利的，因此可以通过在$\\mathbb{Q}$下的等价原则下定价单位连结政策。我们检验了一些可积条件，并找到了合适的风险中性概率测度家族以得到Thiele的微分方程。在人寿保险公司中，计算储备的建立和实践方法是通过解决Thiele的方程，这对于保证保险公司的偿付能力是至关重要的。",
