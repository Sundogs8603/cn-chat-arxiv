    "translated_abstract": "图示教学是一种机器人获取新技能的范式，用户在场景图像上提供2D草图来指导机器人的运动。本文解决了教导机器人接近表面并在其上进行周期运动的问题，运动的周期可以由用户提供的单个草图在机器人摄像头的图像上任意指定。因此，我们引入了“稳定迪歪形图示教学”（SDDT）框架，将机器人的运动建模为“轨道渐近稳定”（O.A.S.）的动力学系统，学习跟随用户指定的草图。通过应用可微分且可逆的函数来对已知的O.A.S.系统进行形变，从而实现这一目标。参数化的迪正形变在我们建模系统的极限周期和草图之间进行Hausdorff距离优化，产生所需的机器人运动。",
