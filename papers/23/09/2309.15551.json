    "translated_abstract": "越来越多地使用深度学习模型分析神经影像数据，揭示大脑、大脑病理和心理特征的见解。然而，诸如参与者年龄、性别或影像伪影等外部的“混淆因素”变量可能会偏导致模型预测，从而阻碍模型学习相关的脑-表型关系。在本研究中，我们提出了一种名为“DeepRepViz”的解决方案，使研究人员能够系统地检测DL模型预测中的混淆因素。该框架包括(1)度量可能混淆因素的影响程度的指标和(2)允许研究人员定性检查DL模型学习内容的可视化工具。通过在模拟和神经影像数据集上进行实验证明了使用DeepRepViz与DL模型结合的益处。例如，神经影像数据集的实验揭示了性别是DL模型预测中的一个显著混淆因素。",
