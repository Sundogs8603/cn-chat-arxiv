    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑具有双重目标的随机多臂老虎机(MAB)问题：(i) 快速识别并选择最佳臂，以及(ii) 在一系列T个连续回合中最大化奖励。尽管每个目标都已经得到了独立的深入研究，即(i)的最佳臂识别和(ii)的遗憾最小化，但是同时实现这两个目标仍然是一个开放的问题，尽管它在实践中非常重要。本文引入了“遗憾最小化的最佳臂识别”(ROBAI)，旨在实现这两个双重目标。为了解决具有预定停止时间和自适应停止时间要求的ROBAI，我们分别提出了$\\mathsf{EOCP}$算法及其变体，不仅在高斯老虎机和一般老虎机中达到了渐进最优遗憾，而且在预定停止时间下，在$\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$回合内选择了最佳臂，在自适应停止时间下，选择了最佳臂在$\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2 T)$回合内。",
