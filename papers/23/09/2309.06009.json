    "abstract": "Many computational linguistic methods have been proposed to study the information content of languages. We consider two interesting research questions: 1) how is information distributed over long documents, and 2) how does content reduction, such as token selection and text summarization, affect the information density in long documents. We present four criteria for information density estimation for long documents, including surprisal, entropy, uniform information density, and lexical density. Among those criteria, the first three adopt the measures from information theory. We propose an attention-based word selection method for clinical notes and study machine summarization for multiple-domain documents. Our findings reveal the systematic difference in information density of long text in various domains. Empirical results on automated medical coding from long clinical notes show the effectiveness of the attention-based word selection method.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多计算语言学方法已被提出用于研究语言的信息内容。我们考虑了两个有趣的研究问题：1)信息是如何在长文档中分布的？2)内容减少（如标记选择和文本摘要）如何影响长文档中的信息密度。我们提出了四个用于估计长文档信息密度的准则，包括惊讶度、熵、均匀信息密度和词汇密度。其中前三个采用了信息论的测量方法。我们为临床笔记提出了一种基于注意力的词汇选择方法，并研究了多领域文档的机器摘要。我们的研究发现了不同领域长文本的信息密度系统差异。对于长临床笔记的自动化医学编码的实证结果表明了基于注意力的词汇选择方法的有效性。",
