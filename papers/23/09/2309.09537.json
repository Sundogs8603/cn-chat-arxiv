    "translated_abstract": "社交网络上的信息扩散预测旨在预测未来消息的接收者，在市场营销和社交媒体等实际应用中具有实用价值。尽管不同的预测模型都声称表现良好，但性能评估的通用框架仍然有限。本文旨在识别模型的性能特征曲线，该曲线捕获了模型在不同复杂度任务上的表现。我们提出了一种基于信息熵的度量方法来量化扩散数据中的随机性，然后确定了随机性与模型预测准确性之间的缩放模式。不同序列长度、系统大小和随机性下的数据点都合并成一条曲线，捕捉了模型在面对增加的不确定性时作出正确预测的内在能力。考虑到这条曲线具有评估模型的重要属性，我们将其定义为模型的性能特征曲线。",

By using a metric based on information entropy, the relationship between randomness and model prediction accuracy is determined, and it is found that data points under different conditions can be collapsed into a single curve, capturing the model's ability to make correct predictions in the face of uncertainty."
