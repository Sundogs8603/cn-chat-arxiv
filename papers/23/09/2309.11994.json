    "translated_abstract": "基于代理的进化算法（SAEAs）在解决昂贵优化问题（EOPs）方面具有重要意义。通过开发高效的模型辅助选择方法，人们已经做出了大量努力来提高SAEAs的效能。然而，生成高质量的解决方案是选择的先决条件。在SAEAs的每一代中仅评估有限数量的解决方案的基本范式减少了相邻种群的方差，从而影响了后代解决方案的质量。这是一个经常遇到的问题，但还没有得到广泛关注。本文提出了一个框架，利用未评估的解决方案来提高SAEAs的效率。代理模型被用来识别高质量解决方案，直接生成新解决方案，无需评估。为了确保可靠的选择，我们引入了两个定制的关系模型，用于选择最佳解决方案和未评估种群。",
