    "translated_abstract": "在生成自然语言文本时，使用最新的强化学习算法，如Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)，因此可以认为推理时间的搜索算法，如Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) 是不必要的。本文证明了通过在PPO之上集成MCTS，可以进一步提升PPO的性能。关键思想是在解码文本时，不要丢弃值网络，即PPO训练时用于评估部分输出序列的副产品，而是将其与策略网络紧密结合。具体而言，本文提出了一种称为PPO-MCTS的新颖的值导向解码算法，可以将来自PPO的值网络与推理时间产生的策略网络紧密结合。与基于MCTS的控制文本生成的先前方法相比，我们的方法的关键优势在于减少了训练和测试之间部分输出的评分机制的基本不匹配。在四个文本生成任务上的评估结果表明，PPO-MCTS可以显著提升性能。",
