    "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to analyse the Bitcoin in order to shed some light on its nature and behaviour. We select 9 cryptocurrencies that account for almost 75\\% of total market capitalisation and compare their evolution with that of a wide variety of traditional assets: commodities with spot and futures contracts, treasury bonds, stock indices, growth and value stocks. Fractal geometry will be applied to carry out a careful statistical analysis of the performance of the Bitcoin returns. As a main conclusion, we have detected a high degree of persistence in its prices, which decreases the efficiency but increases its predictability. Moreover, we observe that the underlying technology influences price dynamics, with fully decentralised cryptocurrencies being the only ones to exhibit self-similarity features at any time scale.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在分析比特币，以揭示其本质和行为。我们选择了占总市值近75％的9种加密货币，并将它们与各种传统资产（商品、期货合约、国债、股票指数、增长股和价值股）的发展进行对比。我们将应用分形几何进行对比特币回报率的统计分析。作为主要结论，我们发现其价格存在较高的持续性，这降低了效率但增加了可预测性。此外，我们观察到底层技术影响价格动态，只有完全去中心化的加密货币在任何时间尺度上表现出自相似特征。",
