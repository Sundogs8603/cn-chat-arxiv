This includes the patient's preferences on offloading devices such as footwear and foot orthotics and their adaptations that suit the patient's intention of use and lifestyle. Through a series of studies, real-world data analysis and machine learning algorithms, high-risk areas can be identified, facilitating the recommendation of precise offloading strategies, including custom orthotic insoles, shoe adaptations, or specialised footwear.
