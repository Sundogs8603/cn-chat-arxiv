    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的方法来定义依赖信息融合的辅助系统，该系统能够结合不同的信息源并提供评估。本文的主要贡献是提供了一个使用证据理论来融合n个信息源的通用框架。融合提供了更可靠的预测和相关的不确定性，可以用于评估预测的可能性。此外，我们提供了一种用于信息融合的机器数据和专家中心模型两个主要来源的方法。我们使用工业设备的数据演示了信息融合方法，从而完善了本研究的应用部分。此外，我们通过提出一种基于证据理论的方法来更新基于数据的模型，解决了数据漂移的问题。我们使用Benchmark Tennessee Eastman进行了验证，并对模型更新进行了割除性研究。",
