    "translated_abstract": "全球各地的城市都面临着可负担和体面住房严重短缺的问题。尽管这对政策至关重要，但我们在有效监测和追踪城市住房进展方面的能力有限。应用于街景图像的基于深度学习的计算机视觉方法在测量社会经济和环境不平等方面取得了成功，但由于时变标签通常不可用，它们并没有充分利用时间图像来跟踪城市变化。我们使用自监督方法在2008年至2021年之间使用1500万张伦敦街景图像来测量变化。我们对Barlow Twins的新颖改进Street2Vec，在不需要手动注释的情况下，嵌入了城市结构，并对季节性和日常变化具有不变性。它优于通用嵌入，成功地从街景图像中识别了伦敦住房供应的点级变化，并区分了主要和次要变化。这种能力可以为城市规划提供及时信息。",
