    "translated_abstract": "在医疗应用中，理解机器/深度学习模型如何做出决策至关重要。在这项研究中，我们介绍了一个神经网络框架，称为“真值表规则”（TT-rules），它将基于规则的模型的全局和精确可解释性性质与深度神经网络的高性能相结合。TT-rules基于“真值表网络”（TTnet）构建，这是一族最初用于形式验证的深度神经网络。通过从训练好的TTnet模型中提取必要且充分的规则$\\mathcal{R}$来产生与TTnet相同输出的规则（全局可解释性），TT-rules有效地将神经网络转换为基于规则的模型。这种基于规则的模型支持小到大的表格数据集的二分类、多标签分类和回归任务。在概述了框架后，我们评估了TT-rules在医疗应用中的性能，并将其与最先进的规则模型进行了比较。",
