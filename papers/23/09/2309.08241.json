To resolve this we introduce a topological loss term to be added to the training loss of Node2vec which tries to align the persistence diagram (PD) of the resulting embedding as closely as possible to that of the input graph. Following results in computational optimal transport, we carefully adapt entropic regularization to PD metrics, allowing us to measure the discrepancy between PDs in a differentiable way. Our modified loss function can then be minimized through gradient descent to reconstruct both the geometry and the topology of the input graph.

    "translated_abstract": "Node2vec是一种图嵌入方法，它学习了加权图每个节点的向量表示，同时尽力保持节点之间的相对距离和全局结构。数值实验表明，Node2vec难以再现输入图的拓扑结构。为了解决这个问题，我们在Node2vec的训练损失中引入了一个拓扑损失项，该损失项试图将生成的嵌入的持续同调图与输入图的持续同调图尽可能地对齐。我们根据计算优化传输中的结果，精心调整了熵正则化的持续同调度量，使我们能够以可微分的方式衡量持续同调图之间的差异。通过梯度下降最小化我们修改后的损失函数，可以重建输入图的几何和拓扑结构。我们使用一些示例合成图展示了这种方法的好处。",
    "tldr": "通过引入拓扑损失项和适应持续同调度量的熵正则化，我们改进了Node2vec方法，使其能够更好地还原输入图的拓扑结构。"
