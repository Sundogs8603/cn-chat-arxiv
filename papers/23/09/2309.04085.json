    "translated_abstract": "共设计涉及同时优化控制器和代理物理设计。其固有的双层优化形式要求通过内层控制优化来驱动外层设计优化。当设计空间较大且每个设计评估都涉及数据密集型的强化学习过程时，这可能会带来挑战。为了提高样本效率，我们提出了一种基于Hyperband的多保真度设计探索策略，在设计空间中通过通用策略学习者将学习到的控制器进行关联，以启动后续控制器学习问题。此外，我们推荐一种特定的遍历Hyperband生成的设计矩阵的方式，以确保随着每个新的设计评估，通用策略学习者的增强效果越来越强，从而降低Hyperband的随机性。实验证明了该方法在广泛的年龄范围内的表现。",
