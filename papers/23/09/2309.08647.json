    "translated_abstract": "准确预测客户支持请求的意图对于高效的支持系统至关重要，使代理人能够快速理解信息并优先响应。尽管存在不同的意图检测方法，但是随着客户群体的扩大，维护单独的客户特定或行业特定模型可能成本高昂且不切实际。本文提出了一种有效地将意图预测扩展到各种客户的系统，即通过将单一通用模型与每个客户的相关意图列表相结合。我们的方法最大限度地减少了培训和维护成本，同时为客户提供个性化体验，实现对其相关意图的变化的无缝适应。此外，我们提出了一种使用客户相关意图作为模型特征的策略，该策略在生产环境中对客户相关意图的变化具有韧性。最终系统的性能明显优于其他方法。",
