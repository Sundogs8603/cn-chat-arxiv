    "translated_abstract": "最近人工智能（AI）系统的进展，包括像ChatGPT这样的大型语言模型，为学术同行评审带来了希望和危险。一方面，AI可以通过解决长时间发表延迟等问题来提高效率。另一方面，它也带来了伦理和社会关注，可能损害同行评审过程和结果的完整性。然而，人类同行评审系统也存在相关问题，如偏见、滥用和缺乏透明度，这已经损害了可信度。尽管越来越多的关注是关于AI在同行评审中的使用，但讨论主要集中在学术期刊出版中的抄袭和署名问题上，忽视了同行评审所处的更广泛的认知、社会、文化和社会认知环境。AI驱动的同行评审的合法性取决于与科学伦理的一致性，包括定义学术协作中适当行为的道德和认识规范。",
