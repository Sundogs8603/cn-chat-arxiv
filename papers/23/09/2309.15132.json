    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are used to identify relationships between genetic variations and specific traits. When applied to high-dimensional medical imaging data, a key step is to extract lower-dimensional, yet informative representations of the data as traits. Representation learning for imaging genetics is largely under-explored due to the unique challenges posed by GWAS in comparison to typical visual representation learning. In this study, we tackle this problem from the mutual information (MI) perspective by identifying key limitations of existing methods. We introduce a trans-modal learning framework Genetic InfoMax (GIM), including a regularized MI estimator and a novel genetics-informed transformer to address the specific challenges of GWAS. We evaluate GIM on human brain 3D MRI data and establish standardized evaluation protocols to compare it to existing approaches. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of GIM and a significantly improved performance on GWAS",

    "translated_abstract": "基因组关联研究主要用于识别基因变异与特定特征之间的关系。将其应用于高维医学成像数据时，关键步骤是提取低维但有信息量的数据表示作为特征。由于与典型的视觉表示学习相比，GWAS所面临的独特挑战，使得图像遗传学的表示学习尚未得到全面探索。在本研究中，我们从互信息的角度解决了这个问题，指出了现有方法的主要局限，并引入了一种基因信息最大化（Genetic InfoMax，GIM）的跨模态学习框架，其中包括正则化的互信息估计器和一种新颖的基因信息启示的转换器，以应对GWAS的特定挑战。我们在人脑三维MRI数据上评估了GIM，并建立了标准化评估协议，与现有方法进行比较。结果表明，GIM具有较好的效果，并在GWAS上表现出显著改进的性能。",
