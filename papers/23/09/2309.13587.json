    "translated_abstract": "各种深度学习模型已被提出用于从两个正交（双平面）X射线图像进行3D骨形重建。然而，由于这些模型在不同的解剖、队列和（通常是私有的）数据集上进行评估，它们之间的比较还不清楚。此外，常常优化的基于图像的分割度量，例如Dice分数，在2D-3D骨形重建中估计临床参数的影响尚不为人所知。为了更接近临床转化，我们提出了一个基准测试框架，评估与真实临床情景相关的任务，包括重建断骨、植入物骨，对人群转移的鲁棒性以及估计临床参数的误差。我们的开源平台提供了8个模型的参考实现（其中许多实现以前不可公开获得），API可轻松收集和预处理6个公共数据集，并实现了自动实证评价。",
