    "translated_abstract": "准确标记生物医学数据是一个挑战。传统的半监督学习方法通常没有充分利用可用的未标记数据。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的基于可靠性的训练数据清洗方法，采用了归纳性符合预测（ICP）。该方法利用一小部分准确标记的训练数据，并利用ICP计算的可靠性指标来纠正海量噪声训练数据中的错误标记和异常值。该方法的有效性在三个分类任务中得到了验证：使用标题和摘要对药物诱导的肝损伤（DILI）文献进行过滤，通过CT影像学和电子健康记录预测COVID-19患者的重症监护病房（ICU）入院情况，以及使用RNA测序数据对乳腺癌进行亚型分型。通过标签排列引入了不同程度的训练标签噪声。结果显示分类性能显著提升：准确度提高",
