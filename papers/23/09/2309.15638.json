    "translated_abstract": "具有平移等变性的卷积神经网络（CNNs）在视网膜血管分割中取得了巨大的成功。然而，CNNs没有对血管形态的其他对称性进行建模，例如旋转和尺度对称性。为了在CNNs中嵌入更多等变性并满足视网膜血管分割的准确性要求，我们构建了一种新颖的卷积算子（FRS-Conv），它是傅里叶参数化的，并且对旋转和缩放等变。具体地，我们首先采用一种新的参数化方案，使卷积滤波器能够以高精度任意进行变换。其次，我们导出了旋转和尺度等变卷积映射的公式。最后，我们根据提出的公式构建了FRS-Conv，并将U-Net和Iter-Net中的传统卷积滤波器替换为FRS-Conv（FRS-Nets）。我们忠实地复现了所有对比方法，并在三个公共数据集上进行了全面实验。",
