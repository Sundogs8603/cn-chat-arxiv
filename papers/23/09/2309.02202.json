    "translated_abstract": "最佳臂识别问题被逐渐应用于数据敏感的应用，例如设计自适应临床试验、调整超参数和进行用户研究等。基于这些应用引发的数据隐私问题，我们研究了在ε-全局差分隐私下的固定置信度下的最佳臂识别问题。首先，为了衡量隐私开销，我们得到了满足ε-全局差分隐私的任何δ-正确的最佳臂识别算法的样本复杂性的下界。我们的下界表明存在两种隐私区域，取决于隐私预算ε。在高隐私区域（小ε）中，困难程度取决于隐私和一种新颖的信息论数量，称为总变差特征时间的耦合效应。在低隐私区域（大ε）中，样本复杂性下界降低到经典的非隐私下界。其次，我们提出了AdaP-TT，一种ε-全局差分隐私下的自适应最佳臂识别算法，通过考虑信息论特性时间的动态调整来平衡隐私与性能之间的权衡。",
