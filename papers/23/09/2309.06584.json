    "translated_abstract": "阿尔茨海默病和相关痴呆症（ADRD）在美国是第六大死亡原因，准确的ADRD风险预测具有重要意义。虽然最近在ADRD风险预测方面取得了一定进展，但大部分依赖于图像分析，而并非所有患者在ADRD诊断前都接受医学影像检查。将机器学习与索赔数据相结合可以揭示额外的风险因素并发现不同医学代码之间的相互关联。我们的目标是利用图神经网络（GNN）和索赔数据进行ADRD风险预测。为了解决这些预测背后缺乏可解释原因的问题，我们引入了一种创新方法来评估关系重要性及其对ADRD风险预测的影响，确保全面解释。我们使用变分正则化编码器-解码器图神经网络（VGNN）来估计ADRD可能性。我们创建了三种情景来评估模型的效率，使用了随机森林和轻梯度...",
