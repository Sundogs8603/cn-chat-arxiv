    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在时间序列预测中的应用仍然是一个重要的研究领域。尽管许多机器学习技术已经成功应用，但计算效率和预测误差之间的关系仍然是一个未被充分探索的领域。本文通过一系列实时实验，以气象预报作为示例应用，量化计算成本与预测误差之间的关系。我们采用了多种流行的回归技术（XGBoost，FC-MLP，Transformer和LSTM）对多地点的温度、风速和云量等三个变量进行多时段、短期预测。在为期5天的实时实验中，我们以每小时推断144个模型的速度训练和推断了4000个数据源。这些模型使用了两种计算成本最小化方法进行参数化，分别是一种新颖的自适应数据减少技术（Variance Horizon）和一种基于性能的概念漂移检测机制。",
