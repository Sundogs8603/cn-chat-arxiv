    "translated_abstract": "尽管生成人工智能在许多领域取得了成功，但其对地理空间数据的建模能力仍未被充分探索。城市流动作为一种典型的地理空间数据，在各种城市应用中至关重要。现有的研究大多集中在对城市流动进行预测建模，即基于历史流动数据预测未来流动情况，但这些数据在数据稀疏的地区或新规划的地区可能无法获取。其他一些研究旨在预测地区之间的OD流量，但未能对城市流动随时间动态变化进行建模。在这项工作中，我们研究了一种新颖的城市流动生成问题，即为没有历史流动数据的地区生成动态城市流动。为了捕捉区域特征和城市环境等多种因素对城市流动的影响，我们采用扩散模型为不同条件下的地区生成城市流动。首先，我们构建了一个城市知识图谱（UKG）来建模城市环境和地区之间的关系。",
