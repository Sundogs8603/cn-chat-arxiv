    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了在重尾分布条件下的经验风险最小化问题，其中数据没有有限方差，但只有$p$阶矩，其中$p \\in (1,2)$。我们选择通过最小化风险值来选择优化器，而不是使用基于截断观测数据的估计过程。这些风险值可以通过使用Catoni的显著方法（Catoni, 2012）进行稳健估计来得到。由于Catoni型影响函数的结构，我们能够通过使用广义的通用链方法建立过度风险的上界。此外，我们考虑了计算问题。我们特别从理论上研究了两种类型的优化方法，即稳健梯度下降算法和基于经验风险的方法。通过广泛的数值研究，我们发现通过Catoni风格估计的经验风险优化器确实比其他基准表现更好。这表明直接基于截断数据的估计可能会导致较差的性能。",
