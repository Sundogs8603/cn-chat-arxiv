In this work, we present a system that can automatically generate high-quality audiobooks from online e-books. In particular, we leverage recent advances in neural text-to-speech to create and release thousands of human-quality, open-license audiobooks from the Project Gutenberg e-book collection. Our method can identify the proper subset of e-book content to read for a wide collection of diversely structured books and can operate on hundreds of books in parallel. Our system allows users to customize an audiobook's speaking speed and style, emotional intonation, and can even match a desired voice using a small amount of sample audio. This work contributed over five thousand open-license audiobooks and an interactive demo that allows users to quickly create their own customized audiobooks. T",

    "translated_abstract": "有声读物可以显著提高文学作品的可访问性和读者参与度。然而，制作、编辑和发布有声读物可能需要数百小时的人力。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个可以从在线电子书自动生成高质量有声读物的系统。特别是，我们利用最近在神经文本到语音方面的进展，从项目古腾堡电子书收藏中创建并发布了数千本高质量、开放许可的有声读物。我们的方法可以针对各种结构多样的图书，识别出适合朗读的电子书内容的合适子集，并可以并行处理数百本书籍。我们的系统允许用户自定义有声读物的朗读速度和风格、情感语调，甚至可以使用少量样本音频来匹配所需的声音。这项工作贡献了5000多本开放许可的有声读物以及一个交互式演示，使用户能够快速创建自己定制的有声读物。",
