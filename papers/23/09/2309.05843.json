    "abstract": "Health-related acoustic signals, such as cough and breathing sounds, are relevant for medical diagnosis and continuous health monitoring. Most existing machine learning approaches for health acoustics are trained and evaluated on specific tasks, limiting their generalizability across various healthcare applications. In this paper, we leverage a self-supervised learning framework, SimCLR with a Slowfast NFNet backbone, for contrastive learning of health acoustics. A crucial aspect of optimizing Slowfast NFNet for this application lies in identifying effective audio augmentations. We conduct an in-depth analysis of various audio augmentation strategies and demonstrate that an appropriate augmentation strategy enhances the performance of the Slowfast NFNet audio encoder across a diverse set of health acoustic tasks. Our findings reveal that when augmentations are combined, they can produce synergistic effects that exceed the benefits seen when each is applied individually.",

    "translated_abstract": "健康相关声音（如咳嗽和呼吸声）对于医学诊断和持续健康监测非常重要。大多数现有的健康声学机器学习方法针对特定任务进行训练和评估，限制了它们在各种医疗应用中的泛化能力。本文利用自监督学习框架SimCLR和Slowfast NFNet背骨进行健康声学的对比学习。优化Slowfast NFNet在这个应用中的一个关键方面在于识别有效的音频增强。我们对各种音频增强策略进行了深入分析，并证明适当的增强策略可以提高Slowfast NFNet音频编码器在各种健康声学任务上的性能。我们的研究结果表明，当增强方法相结合时，它们可以产生超过单独应用每个增强的效果。",
