In this paper, we show how the ACE (Algorithm for Concept Extrapolation) agent can solve one of the key standard challenges in goal misgeneralisation: the CoinRun challenge. It uses no new reward information in the new environment. This points to how autonomous agents could be trusted to act in human interests, even in novel and critical situations.",
