    "translated_abstract": "先前的社交网络分析中关于层次聚类的统计方法都构建了一个“超度量”的层次结构。虽然超度量性的假设在系统发生学文献中已经得到了讨论和研究，但在社交网络文献中尚未得到承认。我们展示了网络中的“非超度量结构”引入了现有自上而下恢复算法的显著不稳定性。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种不稳定性诊断图并使用它来检查一系列经验网络。这些网络似乎违反了“超度量”假设。我们提出了一种看似简单但又很通用的概率模型类，称为$\\mathbb{T}$-随机图，它对潜在层次结构不施加拓扑限制。为了说明这个模型，我们提出了六种替代性的层次网络模型，然后证明了所有六种模型都等价于$\\mathbb{T}$-随机图模型。",
