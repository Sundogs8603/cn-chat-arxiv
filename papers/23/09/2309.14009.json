    "translated_abstract": "理解人们如何在时间和金钱之间进行权衡是时间折现领域的主要问题。已经有大量的研究致力于探索跨时间背景下个体决策过程的潜在机制。本文提出了一系列新的折现函数，并推导出一个形式化的公理化框架。在Bleichrodt、Rohde和Wakker提出的框架基础上，我们进一步扩展了他们提出的CADI和CRDI函数的表达方式，使折现不仅与时间延迟有关，同时也与时间扭曲有关。我们的主要目的是在实践中提供一个可行的框架，对个体的跨时间偏好进行概述。此外，我们应用我们的模型来研究个体时间偏好和人格特征之间的关系。对于CADI-CADI，结果显示吸烟习惯与迫切性和时间感知都密切相关。在大五人格模型中，",
