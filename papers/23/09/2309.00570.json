    "translated_abstract": "理解卷积神经网络如何从图像数据中学习特征是机器学习和计算机视觉中的一个基本问题。在这项工作中，我们确定了这样一个机制。我们提出了卷积神经特征假设，它指出任何卷积层中滤波器的协方差与该层输入的补丁的平均梯度外积成正比。我们对我们的假设提供了大量的实证证据，包括在标准神经网络架构（如AlexNet，VGG和在ImageNet上预训练的ResNets）的卷积层中，发现滤波器的协方差与基于补丁的平均梯度外积之间存在高度相关性。我们还提供了支持理论的证据。然后，我们通过使用基于补丁的平均梯度外积来展示我们结果的普遍性，实现了在卷积核机器中的深度特征学习。我们将得到的算法称为(Deep) ConvRFM，并展示了我们的算法能够恢复出类似的特征。",
