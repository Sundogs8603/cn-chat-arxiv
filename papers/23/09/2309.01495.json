In two pre-registered lottery-choice experiments, we administer three information-search technologies that are based on well-known heuristics: in the ABS (alternative-based search) treatment, subjects explore outcomes and corresponding probabilities within lotteries; in the CBS (characteristic-based search) treatment, subjects explore outcomes and corresponding probabilities across lotteries; in the Baseline treatment, subjects view outcomes and corresponding probabilities all at once. We find that (i) when lottery outcomes comprise gains and losses (experiment 1), exposing subjects to the CBS technology systematically makes them choose safer lotteries, compared to the subjects that are exposed to the other technologies, and (ii) when lottery outcomes comprise gains only (experiment 2), the above results are reversed: exposing subjects to th",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管其重要性，人们对将个体暴露于数字选择界面的影响研究相对较少。在两个预注册的抽奖选择实验中，我们使用基于众所周知的启发式算法的三种信息搜索技术进行测试：在ABS（基于替代选择的搜索）处理中，被试者探索抽奖中的结果和相应的概率；在CBS（基于特征选择的搜索）处理中，被试者在抽奖中探索结果和相应的概率；在基准处理中，被试者一次性查看结果和相应的概率。我们发现（i）当抽奖结果包括损失时（实验1），将被试者暴露于CBS技术会使他们更倾向于选择较安全的抽奖，与暴露于其他技术的被试者相比，（ii）当抽奖结果仅包括收益时（实验2），以上结果被相反：将被试者暴露于CBS技术会使他们更倾向于选择较激进的抽奖。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过实验发现，将个体暴露于基于特征选择的信息搜索技术会影响他们的风险选择。在损失情景下，暴露于该技术的被试者更倾向于选择 safer 的抽奖，而在收益情景下，暴露于该技术的被试者更倾向于选择更激进的抽奖。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study finds that exposing individuals to characteristic-based search technology influences their risky choices. In the loss scenario, subjects exposed to this technology tend to choose safer lotteries, while in the gain scenario, subjects exposed to this technology tend to choose more aggressive lotteries."
