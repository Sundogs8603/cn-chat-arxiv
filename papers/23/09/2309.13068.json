    "translated_abstract": "数据驱动的个性化是时尚电子商务的关键实践，提高了企业为消费者提供更相关内容的方式。而超级个性化为每个消费者提供高度个定制的体验，但需要大量的个人数据来创建个性化的用户旅程。为了减轻这一问题，基于群体的个性化提供了基于更广泛的共同偏好构建的中度个性化，并且仍能对结果进行个性化。我们引入了UNICON，这是一个统一的深度学习消费者细分框架，利用丰富的消费者行为数据来学习长期的潜在表示，并利用它们提取两种关键类型的细分，以满足不同的个性化使用案例：类似目标，通过与行为相似的消费者扩大预定义的目标种子细分，并且数据驱动，揭示具有相似性倾向的非明显消费者细分。通过详细的实验证明，",
