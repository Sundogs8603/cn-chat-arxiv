    "translated_abstract": "开发能够有效识别方言的自动语音识别（ASR）解决方案需要创新的方法，不仅要解决数据稀缺问题，还要处理语言多样性的复杂性。本文针对突尼斯方言，解决了上述ASR挑战。首先，收集了文本和音频数据，并且在某些情况下进行了标注。其次，我们探索自我监督、半监督和少样本切换方法，以在不同突尼斯测试集上推动最先进的技术；涵盖不同的声学、语言和韵律条件。最后，鉴于常规拼写的缺失，我们对转录进行人工评估，以避免测试参考中的拼写不合适所带来的噪声。我们的模型可以转录突尼斯阿拉伯语、英语和法语混合语言的音频样本，并公开发布了所有训练和测试所使用的数据，供公众使用和进一步改进。",
