    "translated_abstract": "在许多机器学习和信号处理任务中，获取稀疏可解释的可观测数据表示是至关重要的。对于表示沿图边缘的流动的数据，一种直观可解释的获取表示的方法是将图结构提升到一个单纯复合体：相关Hodge-Laplacian的特征向量，以及相应单纯复合体的关联矩阵，可引导出Hodge分解，用于以梯度，旋量和谐波流的形式表示观测到的数据。在本文中，我们将这种方法推广到细胞复合体，并引入细胞推断优化问题，即通过添加一组细胞来增强观测到的图，使得关联Hodge Laplacian的特征向量能够提供对图上观测到的边缘流的稀疏可解释表示。我们证明了这个问题是NP难的，并引入了一个高效的近似算法。",
