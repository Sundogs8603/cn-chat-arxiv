This paper aims to provide a reliable, valid, and scalable approach to measure populist stances. For that purpose, we created an annotated dataset based on parliamentary speeches of the German Bundestag (2013 to 2021). Following the ideational definition of populism, we label moralizing references to the virtuous people or the corrupt elite as core dimensions of populist language. To identify, in addition, how the thin ideology of populism is thickened, we annotate how populist statements are attached to left-wing or right-wing host ideologies. We then train a transformer-based model (PopBERT) as a multilabel classifier to detect and quantify each dimension. A battery of validation checks reveals that the model has a strong predictive accuracy, provides high qualitative face validity, matches party rankings of expert surveys, and detects out-of-sa",

    "translated_abstract": "民粹主义的崛起引起了许多政治学家和从业人员的关注，然而对其潜在语言的检测仍然不完整。本文旨在提供一种可靠、有效且可扩展的方法来衡量民粹主义立场。为此，我们基于德国联邦议院的议会演讲(2013年至2021年)创建了一个带注释的数据集。遵循民粹主义的概念定义，我们将对高尚人民或腐败精英的道德引用标记为民粹主义语言的核心维度。为了进一步确定民粹主义薄意识形态的形成方式，我们注释了民粹主义陈述如何与左翼或右翼的主导意识形态相关。然后，我们训练了一个基于Transformer的模型（PopBERT）作为一个多标签分类器，用于检测和量化每个维度。一系列验证检查显示该模型预测准确性强，具有高质量的面部有效性，与专家调查的党派排名相吻合，并检测出-of-sa",
