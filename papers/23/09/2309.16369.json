    "abstract": "The correlation between the sharpness of loss minima and generalisation in the context of deep neural networks has been subject to discussion for a long time. Whilst mostly investigated in the context of selected benchmark data sets in the area of computer vision, we explore this aspect for the audio scene classification task of the DCASE2020 challenge data. Our analysis is based on twodimensional filter-normalised visualisations and a derived sharpness measure. Our exploratory analysis shows that sharper minima tend to show better generalisation than flat minima -even more so for out-of-domain data, recorded from previously unseen devices-, thus adding to the dispute about better generalisation capabilities of flat minima. We further find that, in particular, the choice of optimisers is a main driver of the sharpness of minima and we discuss resulting limitations with respect to comparability. Our code, trained model states and loss landscape visualisations are publicly available.",

    "translated_abstract": "在深度神经网络的背景下，损失函数最小值的锐度和泛化之间的相关性一直存在争议。虽然大多数研究都集中在计算机视觉领域的选定基准数据集上，但我们在DCASE2020挑战数据的音频场景分类任务中探索了这一方面。我们的分析基于二维滤波器归一化可视化和派生的锐度度量。我们的初步分析表明，锐度更高的最小值通常比平坦的最小值具有更好的泛化能力，尤其是对于从之前未见设备录制的领域外数据来说。这进一步加深了关于平坦最小值泛化能力的争议。我们还发现，特别是优化器的选择是最小值锐度的主要驱动因素，并讨论了在可比性方面的相关限制。我们的代码、训练模型状态和损失图景可公开获取。",

The study found that sharper minima tend to have better generalization, especially for out-of-domain data recorded from previously unseen devices. The choice of optimizers is also identified as a main driver of the sharpness of minima, with limitations in comparability discussed."
