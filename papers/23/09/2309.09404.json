We describe a novel system to recommend teams using a variety of AI methods, such that (1) each team achieves the highest possible skill coverage that is demanded by the opportunity, and (2) the workload of distributing the opportunities is balanced amongst the candidate members. We address these questions by extracting skills latent in open data of proposal calls (demand) and researcher profiles (supply), normalizing them using taxonomies, and creating efficient algorithms that match demand to supply. We create teams to maximize goodness along a novel metric balancing short- and long-term objectives. We validate the success of our algorithms (1) quantitatively, by e",

    "translated_abstract": "团队建设和促进合作是非常常见的商业活动。一个例子就是TeamingForFunding问题，研究机构和研究人员在向资助机构申请时，希望能够找到合作机会以回应后者的项目申请。我们描述了一个新颖的系统，利用各种人工智能方法来推荐团队，使得每个团队都能够达到机会要求的最高技能覆盖，并且候选成员之间的工作分配是平衡的。我们通过提取开放数据中的项目申请（需求）和研究人员简介（供给）中的技能潜力，使用分类法对其进行归一化，创建了有效的算法来匹配需求和供给。我们创建团队以最大化一个新的衡量短期和长期目标的度量的优势。我们定量验证了我们算法的成功，通过…",
