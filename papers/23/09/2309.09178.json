    "title": "Does Reliable Electricity Mean Lesser Agricultural Labor Wages? Evidence from Indian Villages. (arXiv:2309.09178v1 [econ.GN])",
    "abstract": "Using a panel of 1,171 villages in rural India that were surveyed in the India Human Development Surveys, I perform a difference-in-differences analysis to find that improvements in electricity reliability have a negative effect on the increase in casual agricultural labor wage rates. Changes in men's wage rates are found to be affected more adversely than women's, resulting in a smaller widening of the gender wage gap. I find that better electricity reliability reduces the time spent by women in fuel collection substantially which could potentially increase labor supply. The demand for labor remains unaffected by reliability, which could lead the surplus in labor supply to cause wage rates to stunt. However, I show that electrical appliances such as groundwater pumps considerably increase labor demand indicating that governments could target increasing the adoption of electric pumps along with bettering the quality of electricity to absorb the surplus labor into agriculture.",

    "translated_abstract": "使用印度人类发展调查中的1,171个农村的面板数据进行区别于差异分析，发现电力可靠性的提高对临时农业劳动力工资的增长产生了负面影响。男性工资的变化受到的影响更为不利，导致了性别工资差距的缩小。我发现，更好的电力可靠性大大减少了妇女在燃料收集上的时间，这可能增加劳动力供应。劳动力需求不受电力可靠性的影响，这可能导致劳动力供应过剩，从而导致工资停滞。然而，我显示，地下水泵等电器设备显著提高了劳动力需求，表明政府可以通过提高电动泵的采用率和改善电力质量来吸纳农业领域的富余劳动力。",

However, better electricity reliability reduces the time spent by women in fuel collection, potentially increasing labor supply. While labor demand remains unaffected, governments could absorb surplus labor into agriculture by promoting the adoption of electric pumps and improving electricity quality."
