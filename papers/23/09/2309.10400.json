    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种名为Positional Skip-wise (PoSE)训练的方法，用于将大型语言模型（LLMs）适应于极长的上下文窗口。PoSE通过在训练过程中使用固定的上下文窗口和操纵位置索引来模拟长输入，将训练长度与目标上下文窗口大小分离。具体而言，我们从长输入序列中选择若干短块，并引入不同的跳跃偏置项来修改每个块的位置索引。这些跳跃偏置项以及每个块的长度在每个训练样本中都会变化，使得模型能够适应目标上下文窗口中的所有位置，而无需对完整长度的输入进行训练。实验证明，与对完整长度进行微调相比，PoSE大大减小了内存和时间开销，对性能影响较小。利用这一优势，我们成功将LLaMA模型扩展到了128k个标记。此外，我们经验证实，PoSE与",
