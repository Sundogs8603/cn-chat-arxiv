    "translated_abstract": "在使用复杂学习器（如深度神经网络）处理大规模数据时，变量重要性评估已成为机器学习应用中的关键步骤。目前，基于移除的重要性评估是参考方法，特别是在需要统计保证来验证变量包含性时。通常，它们使用变量置换方案来实现。然而，这些方法在存在协变量之间的相关性时容易将不重要的变量误识别为重要变量。本文提出了一种系统方法来研究条件置换重要性（Conditional Permutation Importance，CPI），它是模型无关且计算效率高的方法，并提供了基准测试，用于评估当前最先进的变量重要性估计器。理论和实证结果表明，CPI通过提供准确的I型错误控制，克服了标准置换重要性的局限性。当与深度神经网络一起使用时，CPI始终显示出最高的准确性。",
