    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们利用P-GMM（Cheng和Liao，2015）的矩选择过程，在由Elliott等人提出的灵活损失下选择有效和相关的矩来估计和测试预测的合理性。我们在大维度的框架中阐述了矩选择的动机，解释了P-GMM矩选择过程的基本机制，并说明了如何在允许存在可能无效矩条件的预测合理性背景下实施它。我们进行了一系列蒙特卡罗模拟来检验P-GMM估计在将仪器中可用的信息整合到估计和测试中的有限样本性能，并使用由费城联邦储备银行发布的专业预测者调查数据进行实际数据分析，进一步说明了所提出方法的实际价值。结果表明，预测者态度的P-GMM后选择估计器的效果很好。",
