    "translated_abstract": "用户流失，在各种面向客户的业务场景中，以结束与企业关系为特征，对经济产生深远的影响。在许多系统对用户的行动中，如促销折扣和留存活动，预测潜在的流失客户是一个主要目标。在变动剧烈的领域，如幻想体育，不可预测的因素，如国际体育赛事，甚至可以影响到常规的消费习惯。因此，虽然交易历史和用户-产品互动对于预测流失是有价值的，但它们需要深入的领域知识和复杂的特征工程。此外，流失预测系统的特征开发可能会消耗大量资源，特别是在为2亿多用户提供服务的生产环境中，推理流水线主要集中在特征工程上。本文通过对历史数据进行全面的研究，旨在创建一个模型来预测客户流失的可能性，促进决策和行动。",
