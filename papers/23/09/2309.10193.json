    "translated_abstract": "多阶段制造系统（MMS）的建模引起了学术界和工业界的更多关注。最近深度学习方法的进展为以较低成本和专业知识完成这个任务提供了机会。本研究引入了一种随机深度库普曼（SDK）框架来建模MMS的复杂行为。具体而言，我们通过库普曼算子在变分自编码器提取的关键质量信息的传播上，提出了一种新颖的应用。通过这个框架，我们能够使用转换的线性表示有效地捕捉产品质量的一般非线性演变，从而增强基于数据的模型的可解释性。为了评估SDK框架的性能，我们在一个开源数据集上进行了比较研究。本文的主要发现如下。我们的结果表明，在预测分阶段产品质量方面，SDK的准确性超过了其他流行的数据驱动模型。",
