    "abstract": "We develop a neural network architecture which, trained in an unsupervised manner as a denoising diffusion model, simultaneously learns to both generate and segment images. Learning is driven entirely by the denoising diffusion objective, without any annotation or prior knowledge about regions during training. A computational bottleneck, built into the neural architecture, encourages the denoising network to partition an input into regions, denoise them in parallel, and combine the results. Our trained model generates both synthetic images and, by simple examination of its internal predicted partitions, a semantic segmentation of those images. Without any finetuning, we directly apply our unsupervised model to the downstream task of segmenting real images via noising and subsequently denoising them. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves accurate unsupervised image segmentation and high-quality synthetic image generation across multiple datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一种神经网络架构，以非监督方式作为去噪扩散模型进行训练，同时学习生成和分割图像。学习完全是由去噪扩散目标驱动的，在训练期间没有任何注释或关于区域的先验知识。神经网络架构中的计算瓶颈鼓励去噪网络将输入划分为区域，同时对它们进行去噪，并将结果合并。我们训练的模型通过简单检查其内部预测的分区，生成合成图像和这些图像的语义分割。我们直接将我们的无监督模型应用于通过添加噪声然后去噪来分割真实图像的下游任务，无需任何微调。实验证明，我们的模型在多个数据集上实现了准确的无监督图像分割和高质量的合成图像生成。",
