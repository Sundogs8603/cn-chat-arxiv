    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱嵌入被用于通过分析电子医疗记录（如笔记和兽医记录）来受益于动物疾病的诊断。然而，学习用于捕捉知识图谱中带有文本信息的实体和关系的表示是具有挑战性的，因为知识图谱显示出异构特性和各种类型的文本信息。同时，现有的方法大多旨在保留围绕目标节点的图结构，而无法考虑不同类型的文本，而这些文本也可能包含重要的信息。本文提出了一种用于有效诊断动物疾病的知识图谱嵌入模型，该模型可以学习各种类型的文本信息和图结构，并将它们融合为统一的表示，即LiteralKG。具体而言，我们构建了一个知识图谱，该图谱是从各个动物医院收集的电子医疗记录及文本信息构建而来。我们然后融合不同类型的实体和关系，以及文本信息。",
