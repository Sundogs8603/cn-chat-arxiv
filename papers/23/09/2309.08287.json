    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于高效积分和稀疏网格的多项式插值方法，用于定价包含多种标的资产的美式期权。该方法首先利用动态规划的思想对美式期权进行定价，然后使用静态稀疏网格对每个时间步长的继续价值函数进行插值。为了提高效率，我们首先通过缩放tanh映射将定义域从$\\mathbb{R}^d$转换到$(-1,1)^d$，然后通过一个气泡函数消除在$(-1,1)^d$上的边界奇异性，并同时显著减少插值点的数量。我们严格证明了通过适当选择气泡函数，所得到的函数在一定阶数的混合导数上具有有界性，从而为使用稀疏网格提供了理论基础。数值实验结果表明，该方法在美式算术和几何篮子看跌期权定价中效果显著。",
