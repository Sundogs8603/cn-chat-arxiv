    "translated_abstract": "安全的多方计算(MPC)允许用户在不必共享其敏感数据的情况下将机器学习推理外包给不可信的服务器。尽管MPC基于私有推理具有很强的安全性，但由于高通信开销，它在现实世界中并未被广泛采用。当评估ReLU层时，MPC协议需要大量的通信，导致其整体执行时间比非私有推理慢很多。本文提出了一种名为HummingBird的MPC框架，通过在较小的环上使用一部分比特来显著减小ReLU的通信开销。基于理论分析，HummingBird在ReLU评估中识别了不影响准确性的秘密分享的比特，并在评估过程中排除它们以减少通信。通过其高效的搜索引擎，HummingBird在ReLU期间舍弃了87-91%的比特，并仍然保持较高的准确性。",
