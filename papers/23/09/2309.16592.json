    "translated_abstract": "红外图像识别性能较差的主要瓶颈是缺乏足够的标记训练数据，由于获取这些数据的成本高昂。在这项工作中，我们意识到RGB模态的目标检测方法相当稳健（至少对于一些常见类别，如人、车等），这要归功于现有的巨大训练集，因此我们尝试利用RGB模态的线索来扩展目标检测器到红外模态，同时保持RGB模态的模型性能。我们方法的核心是一种新颖的张量分解方法，称为TensorFact，它将卷积神经网络（CNN）的一层卷积核分解为具有比原始CNN更少参数的低秩因子矩阵。我们首先在RGB模态上预训练这些因子矩阵，假定存在大量的训练数据，然后仅在IR模态上增加少量可训练参数，以避免过拟合，同时进行训练。",
    "tldr": "本文介绍了一种在数据受限红外目标检测中利用跨模态知识的方法，通过创新的张量分解方法，将RGB模态的目标检测器扩展到红外模态，同时保持性能。该方法首先在RGB模态上进行预训练，然后在IR模态上进行微调，以提高红外目标检测性能。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a method for leveraging cross-modal knowledge in data-constrained infrared object detection. By using a novel tensor decomposition method, the object detector in the RGB modality is scaled to the infrared modality while maintaining performance. The method first pretrains on the RGB modality and then fine-tunes on the infrared modality to improve detection performance."
