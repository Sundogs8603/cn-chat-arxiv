    "translated_abstract": "分割学习（SL）是一种新的协作学习技术，允许参与者，例如客户端和服务器，不共享原始数据进行机器学习模型的训练。在这种设置下，客户端首先在原始数据上应用其所属机器学习模型的部分，生成激活图，然后将它们发送到服务器以继续训练过程。以前的研究表明，重建激活图可能会导致客户数据的隐私泄漏。此外，现有的减轻SL隐私泄漏的技术在准确性方面证明显著较差。在本文中，我们改进了以往的工作，构建了一种基于U型SL的协议，可以在同态加密数据上操作。具体而言，在我们的方法中，客户端在将激活图发送到服务器之前对其进行同态加密，从而保护用户隐私。这是一个重要的改进，有助于提升隐私保护的能力。",
