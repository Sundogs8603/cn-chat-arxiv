    "translated_abstract": "遗传算法（GAs）以其在解决组合优化问题方面的效率而闻名，拥有探索多样化解空间的能力、处理各种表示、利用并行性、保留良好解、适应变化动态、处理组合多样性和提供启发式搜索的能力。然而，GAs存在早熟收敛、缺乏问题特定知识和交叉和变异操作的随机性等限制，使其通常在找到最优解方面效率低下。为了解决这些限制，本文提出了一种名为遗传工程算法（GEA）的新型元启发式算法，从基因工程概念中汲取灵感。GEA重新设计了传统遗传算法，同时引入新的搜索方法，通过隔离、纯化、插入和表达新基因，基于已有基因产生特定染色体，从而实现所需特征的出现和特定染色体的生成。比较评估结果表明，GEA在多个组合优化问题上超过了传统遗传算法和其他元启发式算法。",
