    "abstract": "Seeking health-related advice on the internet has become a common practice in the digital era. Determining the trustworthiness of medical claims found online and finding appropriate evidence for this information is increasingly challenging. Fact-checking has emerged as an approach to assess the veracity of factual claims using evidence from credible knowledge sources. To help advance the automation of this task, in this paper, we introduce a novel dataset of 750 health-related claims, labeled for veracity by medical experts and backed with evidence from appropriate clinical studies. We provide an analysis of the dataset, highlighting its characteristics and challenges. The dataset can be used for Machine Learning tasks related to automated fact-checking such as evidence retrieval, veracity prediction, and explanation generation. For this purpose, we provide baseline models based on different approaches, examine their performance, and discuss the findings.",

    "translated_abstract": "在数字时代，通过互联网查询健康相关建议已成为一种常见做法。然而，判断在线找到的医学声明的可信度，并找到相应的证据，变得越来越具有挑战性。事实检验已经成为一种通过可靠知识来源的证据评估事实声明真实性的方法。为了推动此任务的自动化，本文介绍了一份新的数据集，包含了750个健康相关声明，在可信度方面由医学专家进行了标注，并提供了来自适当的临床研究的证据支持。我们对数据集进行了分析，突出其特点和挑战。该数据集可用于与自动事实检验相关的机器学习任务，如证据检索、真实性预测和解释生成。为此，我们提供了基于不同方法的基线模型，对它们的性能进行了研究，并讨论了研究结果。",
