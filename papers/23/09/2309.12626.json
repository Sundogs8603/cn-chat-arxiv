    "translated_abstract": "在建筑项目中，合同审查是防止潜在损失的重要步骤。然而，当前用于审查建筑合同的方法缺乏效果和可靠性，导致耗时和容易出错。虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）在改革自然语言处理（NLP）任务方面显示出潜力，但它们在处理领域特定知识和解决专门问题方面存在困难。本文提出了一种新颖的方法，利用具备建筑合同知识的LLMs来模拟人类专家的合同审查过程。我们的无调整方法将建筑合同领域知识结合到语言模型中，以识别建筑合同风险。在构建领域知识库时使用自然语言有助于实际应用。我们在真实的建筑合同上对我们的方法进行了评估，并取得了良好的性能。此外，我们还研究了大型语言模型如何应用于建筑合同的识别过程。",
