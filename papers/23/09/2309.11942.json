    "abstract": "This work is devoted to the study of the probability of immunity, i.e. the effect occurs whether exposed or not. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for non-immunity and $\\epsilon$-bounded immunity, i.e. the probability of immunity is zero and $\\epsilon$-bounded, respectively. The former allows us to estimate the probability of benefit (i.e., the effect occurs if and only if exposed) from a randomized controlled trial, and the latter allows us to produce bounds of the probability of benefit that are tighter than the existing ones. We also introduce the concept of indirect immunity (i.e., through a mediator) and repeat our previous analysis for it. Finally, we propose a method for sensitivity analysis of the probability of immunity under unmeasured confounding.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文致力于研究免疫的概率，即无论暴露与否，效果都会发生。我们导出了免疫的必要和充分条件以及ε-有界免疫的条件，前者允许我们从随机对照试验中估计受益的概率（即只有在暴露的情况下效果才会发生），后者允许我们得到比现有的边界更紧密的受益概率边界。我们还引入了间接免疫的概念（通过介质），并对其进行了前述分析。最后，我们提出了一种用于在未测量混淆情况下进行免疫概率敏感性分析的方法。",
