    "abstract": "Lifelong learning, also referred to as continual learning, is the problem of training an AI agent continuously while also preventing it from forgetting its previously acquired knowledge. Most of the existing methods primarily focus on lifelong learning within a static environment and lack the ability to mitigate forgetting in a quickly-changing dynamic environment. Streaming lifelong learning is a challenging setting of lifelong learning with the goal of continuous learning in a dynamic non-stationary environment without forgetting. We introduce a novel approach to lifelong learning, which is streaming, requires a single pass over the data, can learn in a class-incremental manner, and can be evaluated on-the-fly (anytime inference). To accomplish these, we propose virtual gradients for continual representation learning to prevent catastrophic forgetting and leverage an exponential-moving-average-based semantic memory to further enhance performance.

    "translated_abstract": "终身学习是指在训练AI代理的同时，防止其遗忘以前获得的知识的问题。现有的方法大多关注在静态环境下的终身学习，并且缺乏在快速变化的动态环境中减轻遗忘的能力。流式终身学习是终身学习中一个具有挑战性的设置，其目标是在动态的非平稳环境中进行连续学习而不遗忘。我们引入一种新颖的终身学习方法，该方法是流式的，仅需要对数据进行一次遍历，可以以类增量的方式学习，并且可以进行即时评估（实时推理）。为了实现这些，我们提出了用于连续表示学习的虚拟梯度，以防止灾难性遗忘，并借助基于指数移动平均的语义记忆进一步提高性能。我们在多样化的数据上进行了广泛的实验。",
