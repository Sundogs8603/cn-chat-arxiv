    "translated_abstract": "类别无关计数方法可以对任意类别的对象进行计数，在许多领域中提供了巨大的实用性。然而，现有的方法只能适用于需要一组特定类型的示例或图像中仅包含一种类型对象的情况。这些方法的局限之一是缺乏适用于多种对象同时存在的计数设置的数据集。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了第一个多类别、类别无关计数数据集（MCAC）以及一种名为ABC123的盲目计数方法，该方法可以在训练或推断过程中不使用特定类型示例来同时计数多种对象。ABC123引入了一种新的范式，在计数阶段后找到示例来帮助用户理解生成的输出，而不需要先导样本来引导计数。我们展示了ABC123在MCAC上优于现有方法，而无需人工干预进行标注。",
