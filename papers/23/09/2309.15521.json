    "translated_abstract": "如今，机器学习（ML）正在经历前所未有的流行。ML模型的操作化由一组被称为机器学习操作（MLOps）的概念和方法所指导。然而，研究人员和专业人员往往更多地关注自动化方面，忽视MLOps的持续部署和监控方面。结果，由于概念漂移，特别是在处理稀缺数据时，从生产到开发过程中的反馈缺乏连续学习，导致模型会随时间不断恶化。本文探讨了在稀缺数据分析环境中完全应用MLOps的情况。该论文提出了一种新的整体方法来增强生物医学图像分析。我们的方法包括：指纹化过程，使得根据手头的图像分析任务选择最佳模型、数据集和模型开发策略；一种自动化的模型开发过程。",
