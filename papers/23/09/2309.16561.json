    "abstract": "High-resolution aerial imagery allows fine details in the segmentation of farmlands. However, small objects and features introduce distortions to the delineation of object boundaries, and larger contextual views are needed to mitigate class confusion. In this work, we present an end-to-end trainable network for segmenting farmlands with contour levees from high-resolution aerial imagery. A fusion block is devised that includes multiple voting blocks to achieve image segmentation and classification. We integrate the fusion block with a backbone and produce both semantic predictions and segmentation slices. The segmentation slices are used to perform majority voting on the predictions. The network is trained to assign the most likely class label of a segment to its pixels, learning the concept of farmlands rather than analyzing constitutive pixels separately. We evaluate our method using images from the National Agriculture Imagery Program. Our method achieved an average accuracy of 94.3",

    "translated_abstract": "高分辨率航空影像允许在农田分割中获取细节信息。然而，小物体和特征会导致物体边界的扭曲，需要更大的上下文视图来减少类别混淆。本文提出了一个端到端可训练的网络，用于从高分辨率航空影像中分割等高堤农田。我们设计了一个融合块，其中包括多个投票块，以实现图像分割和分类。我们将融合块与骨干网络结合，同时生成语义预测和分割片段。分割片段用于在预测上进行多数投票。网络被训练为将段落的最有可能类别标签分配给其像素，从而学习农田的概念，而不是单独分析像素。",
