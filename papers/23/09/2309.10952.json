    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理（NLP）中取得了革命性的进展，改进了许多现有任务的最新技术，并展示了新兴的能力。然而，LLM尚未成功应用于半结构化文档信息提取，这是许多文档处理工作流的核心，包括从视觉丰富的文档（VRD）中提取关键实体，给定预定义的目标模式。LLM在这个任务中的主要障碍是LLM中缺乏布局编码，这对于高质量的提取至关重要，以及缺乏一个基于理论的机制，确保答案不是虚构的。在本文中，我们介绍了一种基于语言模型的文档信息提取与定位（LMDX）的方法，用于将任意LLM适应文档信息提取。LMDX可以提取单一、重复和层次结构实体，无论是否有训练数据，并提供基于理论的保证。",
