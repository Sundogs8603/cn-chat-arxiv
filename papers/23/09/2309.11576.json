    "translated_abstract": "谣言检测模型的一个关键方面是其泛化能力，特别是其能够检测出新出现的、以前未知的谣言的能力。过去的研究表明，仅基于内容（即仅使用来源帖子作为输入）的谣言检测模型在未知谣言上的表现效果较差。与此同时，基于上下文的模型的潜力尚未充分利用。本文的主要贡献在于深入评估基于内容和基于上下文模型在特别是检测新的未知谣言上的性能差距。我们的实证研究结果表明，基于上下文的模型仍然过度依赖来自谣言来源帖子的信息，并倾向于忽略上下文信息可能发挥的重要作用。我们还研究了数据拆分策略对分类器性能的影响。根据我们的实验结果，本文还提出了如何减小时间概念影响的实际建议。",
