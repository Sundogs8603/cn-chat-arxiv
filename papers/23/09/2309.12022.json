    "translated_abstract": "在电影行业中，电影海报多年来一直是广告和营销的重要组成部分，即使在现今的数字海报通过在线、社交媒体和OTT平台上仍然发挥着至关重要的作用。通常，电影海报能够有效地推广和传达电影的本质，例如其类型、视觉风格/调调、氛围和故事线索/主题，这些对吸引潜在观众非常重要。对电影类型进行识别常常在向目标观众推荐电影时具有重要的实际应用。之前的电影类型识别研究仅限于字幕、剧情简介和电影场景，这些大多数在电影发布后才能获取。海报通常包含在发行前隐含的信息来引起大量兴趣。在本文中，我们从电影海报图像中自动进行多标签电影类型识别，而无需任何关于电影的附加文本/元数据信息的帮助，这是其中之一。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过分析电影海报图像，解密了电影海报的视觉特征，并提出了一种自动化的多标签电影类型识别方法，无需使用其他文本或元数据信息，具有推广和营销电影的实际应用意义。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper demystifies the visual features of movie posters and presents an automated multi-label genre identification method solely based on movie poster images, without the need for additional textual or meta-data information. This study has practical applications in film promotion and marketing."
