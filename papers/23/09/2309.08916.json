In this work, a bidirectional graph generative adversarial networks (BGGAN) is proposed to represent brain structure-function connections. Specifically, by designing a module incorporating inner graph convolution network (InnerGCN), the generators of BGGAN can employ features of direct and indirect brain regions to learn the mapping function between structural domain and functional domain. Besides, a new module named Balancer is designed to counterpoise the optimization between generators and discriminators. By introducing the Balancer into BGGAN, both the structural generator and functional generator can not only alleviate the issue of mode collapse but also learn complementarity of structural and functional features.

    "translated_abstract": "揭示脑疾病的发病机制，包括阿尔茨海默病（AD），脑结构与功能之间的关系至关重要。然而，由于各种原因，将脑结构-功能连接映射是一个巨大的挑战。本文提出了一种双向图生成对抗网络（BGGAN）来表示脑结构-功能连接。具体来说，通过设计一个内部图卷积网络（InnerGCN）模块，BGGAN的生成器可以利用直接和间接脑区域的特征来学习结构域和功能域之间的映射函数。此外，还设计了一个名为Balancer的新模块来平衡生成器和判别器之间的优化。通过将Balancer引入到BGGAN中，结构生成器和功能生成器不仅可以缓解模式坍塌问题，还可以学习结构和功能特征的互补性。实验结果表明该方法能够在AD中准确地表示脑结构-功能连接。",
