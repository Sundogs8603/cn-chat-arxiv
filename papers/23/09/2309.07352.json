    "translated_abstract": "影像遗传学和类似领域的一个主要挑战是将一个领域（如遗传数据）中的高维数据与另一个领域（如脑成像数据）中的高维数据进行关联。该领域的标准方法是通过遗传因素和成像表型进行大规模单变量分析。这意味着对每个预定义的成像测量执行一次全基因组关联研究（GWAS）。尽管这种方法非常成功，但它的一个缺点是表型必须事先定义好。因此，不被限制在预选感兴趣区域内或反映更大的整个大脑模式的效应很容易被忽视。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种基于偏最小二乘（PLS）的框架，称为Cluster-Bootstrap PLS（CLUB-PLS），它可以同时处理两个领域的大量输入维度以及大样本量。该框架的一个关键因素是使用聚类自助法为单个输入特征提供稳健的统计数据。",
