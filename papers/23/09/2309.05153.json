    "translated_abstract": "在高维数据上使用最大似然估计训练能量基准模型（EBMs）可能具有挑战性且耗时较长。因此，EBMs和其他生成框架（如GANs和扩散模型）之间存在明显的样本质量差距。为了弥补这一差距，受最近通过最大化扩散恢复似然（DRL）来学习EBMs的努力的启发，我们提出了协同扩散恢复似然（CDRL），一种有效的方法来可行地学习和从一系列EBMs中进行采样，这些EBMs定义在越来越嘈杂的数据集版本上，并与每个EBM的初始化模型配对。在每个噪声水平上，初始化模型学习在EBM的采样过程中分摊，而两个模型在协同训练框架内共同估计。初始化模型生成的样本作为起始点，经过EBM的几个采样步骤进行改进。通过改进后的样本，通过最大化恢复似然来优化EBM。",
