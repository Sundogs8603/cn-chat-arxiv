To better understand user sentiment about the breadth of recommendations given by a movie recommender, we conducted interviews and surveys and found out that many users considered narrow recommendations to be useful, while a smaller number explicitly wanted greater breadth. Additionally, we designed and ran an online field experiment with a larger user group, evaluating two new interfaces designed to provide users with greater access to broader recommendations. We looked at user preferences and behavior for two groups of users: those with higher initial movie diversity and those with lower diversity. Among our finding",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统常常难以在满足用户口味和提供意外推荐之间取得平衡。当推荐过于狭窄，无法涵盖用户偏好的完整范围时，系统被认为无用。相反，当系统建议太多用户不喜欢的物品时，被认为是冷漠或无效的。为了更好地了解用户对电影推荐系统广度的情感，我们进行了访谈和调查，并发现许多用户认为狭窄的推荐是有用的，而少数用户明确希望获得更广泛的推荐。此外，我们设计并进行了一项在线现场实验，评估了两种新接口，旨在向用户提供更广泛的推荐。我们观察了两组用户的偏好和行为：具有较高初始电影多样性和具有较低多样性的用户。在我们的发现中，",

The findings indicate that narrow recommendations are considered useful by many users, but there is also a subset of users who desire broader recommendations."
