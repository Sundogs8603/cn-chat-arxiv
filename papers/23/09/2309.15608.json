    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的学习图像重建方法，适用于基于多个接收线圈的加速心脏MRI。该方法基于深度卷积神经网络（CNN）和算法展开。与许多现有的学习MR图像重建技术不同，需要将灵敏度映射（CSM）估计作为一个独立的网络组件，我们提出的方法避免了显式的CSM估计。相反，它隐含地捕捉并学习利用图像之间的接收线圈关系。我们的方法由一系列新颖的学习图像块和k空间块组成，共享潜在信息，并通过特征调节和接收线圈数据一致性实现对采集参数的适应性。在MICCAI STACOM CMRxRecon挑战赛的影片追踪和映射追踪验证排行榜中，我们的方法分别在PSNR值上达到了34.89和35.56，SSIM值分别为0.920和0.942，在撰写本文时位列不同小组第4位。",
