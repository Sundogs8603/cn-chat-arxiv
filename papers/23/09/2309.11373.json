Such high predictive performance can be extended to a wide range of comorbidity factors and exists even when the model was",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的医疗机器学习研究引起了人们对患者隐私和算法公平性的关注。例如，之前的研究表明，即使医疗数据中没有明确包含种族信息，也可以通过医疗数据预测患者自报的种族信息。然而，我们对数据识别的程度没有了解，也缺乏开发模型以最小程度受到这些信息影响的方法。在这里，我们系统地研究了时间序列电子健康记录数据预测患者静态信息的能力。我们发现，不仅原始的时间序列数据，还有从机器学习模型学习到的表示，都可以被训练用来预测各种静态信息，其接收者操作特征曲线下面积可达到0.851（对生物学性别）、0.869（对二值化年龄）和0.810（对自报种族）。这种高预测性能可以扩展到广泛的共病因素，并且即使在模型被解释时也存在。",
