    "translated_abstract": "步态识别（GR）是通过视觉摄像头从远处识别人员的生物测定模式。GR提供了一个安全可靠的替代方案，用于指纹和面部识别，因为很难区分假象和真实信号。此外，它对欺诈的抵抗力使得GR适用于各种环境。随着深度学习的兴起，GR技术在各种环境中取得了令人期待的成果。随着视频监控的普及，新的障碍不断出现，例如确保在不同协议中进行统一性能评估，可靠的识别尽管光照条件变化，步态模式波动以及保护隐私。本综述旨在概述GR并分析可能影响其环境要素和复杂性，相对于其他生物测定系统。主要目标是研究现有的深度学习（DL）技术。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文总结了使用深度学习进行人体步态识别的研究，探讨了其在不同环境中的应用、优势以及可能遇到的挑战。"
