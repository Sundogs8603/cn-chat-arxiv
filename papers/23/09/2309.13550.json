By capturing the intensity of the radiologist's gaze, we provide a unified solution that offers insights into the cognitive process underlying radiological interpretation.

    "translated_abstract": "在胸部X光（CXR）诊断领域中，现有的研究往往仅关注放射科医生的注视位置，通常通过检测、分割或分类等任务来实现。然而，这些方法常常被设计为黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性。本文引入了一种新颖且统一的可控解释性管道，用于解码放射科医生在CXR诊断中的专注焦点。我们的方法解决了三个关键问题：放射科医生的注视位置、他们在特定区域的注意时长以及他们的诊断结果。通过捕捉放射科医生注视的强度，我们提供了一种统一的解决方案，可以洞察放射学解释过程的认知过程。与当前依赖于黑盒机器学习模型的方法不同，这些模型在诊断过程中容易从整个输入图像中提取错误信息，我们通过有效地屏蔽无关信息来解决这个问题。",
