    "translated_abstract": "本研究试图通过理论分析揭示劳动力的演化发展。以衡量社会福利的GDP为例，试图通过经验建模来衡量家庭主妇劳动的经济价值。为此，首先质疑了正统（主流）经济理论中劳动的概念；然后，摒弃劳动就业关系，考察了在资本主义体制下失业的无偿家庭主妇劳动对GDP的影响。在理论分析中，确定了人类特征的变化使其远离理性，形成了有限理性和异质个体特征的限制理性个体特征。将女性定义为异质个体的新例子，因为她们更适合有限理性个体的定义，即更倾向于成为家庭主妇。在本研究的实证分析中，对家庭主妇劳动进行了研究。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study examines the impact of housewife labor on GDP calculations through theoretical analysis and empirical modeling. The findings suggest that the changing human profile leads to the formation of limited rational individuals, with women being more inclined to choose to be housewives. The empirical analysis reveals the economic value of housewife labor."
