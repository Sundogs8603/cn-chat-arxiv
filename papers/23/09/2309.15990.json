The research focused on the proficiency of supervised machine learning models predicting complications using consecutive gait datasets. We identified patients with lower extremity fractures at an academic center. Patients underwent gait analysis with a chest-mounted IMU device. Using software, raw gait data was preprocessed, emphasizing 12 essential gait variables. Machine learning models including XGBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM, LightGBM, and Random Forest were trained, tested, and evaluated. Attention was given to class imbalance, addressed using SMOTE.
