    "translated_abstract": "日志数据可以揭示用户与网络搜索服务的交互方式、用户的需求以及满意程度等宝贵信息。然而，分析日志数据中的用户意图并不容易，尤其是对于新的网络搜索形式，如人工智能驱动的聊天。为了理解日志数据中的用户意图，我们需要一种能够用有意义的分类方式标记它们的方法，以捕捉其多样性和动态性。现有的方法依赖于手动或基于机器学习的标注，这些方法对于大型且不断变化的数据集而言，要么代价高昂要么不够灵活。我们提出了一种使用大型语言模型(LLM)的新方法，这种模型能够生成丰富且相关的概念、描述和示例来表示用户意图。然而，使用LLM生成用户意图分类并将其应用于日志分析可能存在两个主要问题：这样的分类得不到外部验证，并且可能存在不良的反馈回路。为了克服这些问题，我们提出了一种新的方法，通过人工专家和评估者来验证。",
