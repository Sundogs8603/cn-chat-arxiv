    "translated_abstract": "过去几年中，YOLO系列模型已成为实时目标检测领域的领先方法。许多研究通过修改架构、增加数据和设计新的损失函数将基线提升到了更高水平。然而，我们发现之前的模型仍然存在信息融合问题，虽然特征金字塔网络（FPN）和路径聚合网络（PANet）已经缓解了这个问题。因此，本研究提出了一种先进的收集和分发机制（GD）机制，通过卷积和自注意力操作实现。这个新设计的模型名为Gold-YOLO，提升了多尺度特征融合能力，并在所有模型尺度上实现了延迟和准确性的理想平衡。此外，我们首次在YOLO系列中实现了MAE风格的预训练，使得YOLO系列模型可以从无监督预训练中受益。Gold-YOLO-N在COCO val2017数据集上达到了出色的39.9%平均精度（AP）。",
