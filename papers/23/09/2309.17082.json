    "abstract": "In this work, we establish a direct connection between generative diffusion models (DMs) and stochastic quantization (SQ). The DM is realized by approximating the reversal of a stochastic process dictated by the Langevin equation, generating samples from a prior distribution to effectively mimic the target distribution. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the DM can serve as a global sampler for generating quantum lattice field configurations in two-dimensional $\\phi^4$ theory. We demonstrate that DMs can notably reduce autocorrelation times in the Markov chain, especially in the critical region where standard Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithms experience critical slowing down. The findings can potentially inspire further advancements in lattice field theory simulations, in particular in cases where it is expensive to generate large ensembles.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究建立了生成性扩散模型（DM）和随机量子化（SQ）之间的直接联系。通过近似满足Langevin方程的随机过程的反演，生成符合目标分布的样本来实现DM。通过数值模拟，我们证明DM可以作为全局采样器来生成二维$\\phi^4$理论中的量子格点场配置。我们证明DM可以显著减少马尔科夫链的自相关时间，特别是在标准马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）算法在临界区域遇到临界减慢时。这些发现有望在格点场论模拟中激发进一步的进展，特别是在生成大型数据集昂贵的情况下。",
