    "translated_abstract": "在购物网站上，低质量的产品图片会对客户的体验产生负面影响。尽管在检测具有不同缺陷的图像方面已经有大量的工作，但很少有工作致力于在规模上纠正这些缺陷。一个主要的挑战是，有成千上万种产品类型，每种类型都有特定的缺陷，因此构建特定缺陷的模型是不可扩展的。在本文中，我们提出了一个统一的图像到图像（I2I）转换模型，以纠正不同产品类型上的多个缺陷。我们的模型利用注意力机制，以分层方式将高级缺陷组和特定缺陷类型合并，引导网络将焦点放在与缺陷相关的图像区域上。在八个公共数据集上进行评估，我们的模型与目前最先进的I2I方法MoNCE相比，平均将Frechet Inception Distance (FID)降低了24.6%。与公共数据不同，购物网站上的另一个实际挑战是有些配对图像质量较低。因此，",
