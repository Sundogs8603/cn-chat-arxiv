    "translated_abstract": "视觉对象导航（VON）的任务是使智能体能够在给定的场景中定位特定的对象。为了成功完成VON任务，必须满足两个基本条件：1）用户必须知道所需对象的名称；2）用户指定的对象必须确实存在于场景中。为了满足这些条件，模拟器可以将预定义的对象名称和位置纳入场景的元数据中。然而，在现实世界的情况下，确保始终满足这些条件往往是具有挑战性的。在陌生的环境中，人们可能不知道场景中存在哪些对象，或者他们可能错误地指定一个实际上不存在的对象。尽管存在这些挑战，人们仍然可能对一个对象有需求，这个需求可能可以通过场景中存在的其他对象以等效的方式来满足。因此，我们提出了需求驱动导航（DDN），它利用用户的需求与场景中的对象属性空间进行导航决策。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种称为需求驱动导航的方法，利用用户的需求与场景中的对象属性空间进行导航决策，并解决了在实际情况中用户无法知道对象名称或指定对象不存在的问题。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method called Demand-driven Navigation (DDN), which leverages user's demand and object attribute space in the scene for navigation decision-making, addressing the issue of user's lack of knowledge on object names or specifying non-existent objects in real-world scenarios."
