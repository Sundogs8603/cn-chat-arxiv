    "translated_abstract": "最大可提取价值(MEV)是分散系统中常见的临时垄断权力所能够提取的价值。这种提取源于交易提交时用户隐私的缺乏，以及垄断验证者对交易进行重新排序、添加和/或审查的能力。减少MEV有两个主要方向：通过强制排序规则来减少矿工重新排序交易的灵活性，并/或者引入一个竞争市场来重新排序、添加和/或审查交易的权限。在本研究中，我们通过类似于谐波分析和物理学中所发现的\"不确定性原理\"来统一这些方法。这提供了重新排序交易自由度和分散网络中用户经济利益的复杂性之间的定量权衡。这种权衡类似于奈奎斯特-香农采样定理，并表明区块链中的排序规则需要针对特定应用程序。我们的研究结果表明，现有的方法既不能完全解决MEV问题，也不能充分利用MEV的潜在价值。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method for addressing the issue of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) based on the uncertainty principle. By enforcing ordering rules and introducing a competitive market, the flexibility of miners can be reduced while achieving a balance between transaction freedom and economic benefits."
