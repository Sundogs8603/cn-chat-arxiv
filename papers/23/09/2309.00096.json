    "translated_abstract": "开放词汇语义分割是一项具有挑战性的任务，需要在推理时对新的对象类别进行分割。最近的研究探索了视觉-语言预训练来处理这个任务，但在实际场景中存在不切实际的假设，即低质量的文本类别名称。例如，这种范式假设新的文本类别将被准确完整地提供，并且存在于预训练期间的词典中。然而，当遇到简短或不完整的名称、在预训练的词典中不存在的新词以及难以描述的类别时，异常情况经常发生。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新的分解-聚合框架，受人类认知在理解新概念方面的启发。具体地，在分解阶段，我们将类别名称分解为多样的属性描述，以丰富语义上下文。设计了两种属性构建策略：使用大型语言",
