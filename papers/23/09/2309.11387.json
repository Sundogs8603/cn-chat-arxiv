    "translated_abstract": "信息提供实验是一种越来越流行的工具，用于确定信念如何因果地影响决策和行为。在基于负担信息获取的简单贝叶斯信念形成模型中，当这些信念对他们的决策至关重要时，人们形成精确的信念。先前信念的精确度控制着当他们接受新信息时他们的信念变化程度（即第一阶段的强度）。由于两阶段最小二乘法（TSLS）以权重与第一阶段的强度成比例的加权平均为目标，TSLS会过度加权具有较小因果效应的个体，并低估具有较大效应的个体，从而低估了信念对行为的平均部分效应。在所有参与者都接受新信息的实验设计中，贝叶斯更新意味着可以使用控制函数来确定（非加权的）平均部分效应。我将这个估计器应用于最近一项关于效应的研究。",
