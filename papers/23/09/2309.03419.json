    "abstract": "Why do investors delegate financial decisions to supposed experts? We report a laboratory experiment designed to disentangle four possible motives. Almost 600 investors drawn from the Prolific subject pool choose whether or not to delegate a real-stakes choice among lotteries to a previous investor (an ``expert'') after seeing information on the performance of several available experts. We find that a surprisingly large fraction of investors delegate even trivial choice tasks, suggesting a major role for the blame shifting motive. A larger fraction of investors delegate our more complex tasks, suggesting that decision costs play a role for some investors. Some investors who delegate choose a low quality expert with high earnings, suggesting a role for chasing past performance. We find no evidence for a fourth possible motive, that delegation makes risk more acceptable.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了解为什么投资者会委托金融决策给专家，我们进行了一项实验，并探究了四种可能的动机。实验结果显示，甚至在轻松的选择任务中，有相当大比例的投资者倾向于委托决策，这表明责任转嫁动机起了重要的作用。对于更复杂的任务，更多的投资者选择委托，这说明决策成本对某些投资者有影响。一些委托者选择了低质量的、收益较高的专家，这表明追求过去表现的动机也起到了一定作用。我们没有发现第四种可能动机：委托使风险更加可接受。",
