    "translated_abstract": "高质量的人类转录对于训练和改进自动语音识别（ASR）模型至关重要。最近的研究发现，每增加1%的转录错误率（WER），使用这些转录来训练ASR模型将增加约2%的ASR WER。即使是经过高度培训的注释员也难免出现转录错误。然而，很少有研究探讨人类转录错误的修正方法。其他问题的错误修正方法，如ASR错误修正和语法错误修正，对这个问题的表现不够好。因此，我们提出了HTEC用于人类转录错误修正。HTEC包括两个阶段：Trans-Checker，一种错误检测模型，用于预测和屏蔽错误单词，和Trans-Filler，一种序列到序列的生成模型，用于填充屏蔽位置。我们提出了一个综合的修正操作列表，其中包括四种处理删除错误的新操作。",
