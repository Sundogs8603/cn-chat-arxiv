    "translated_abstract": "预测创业公司的成功对于创业生态系统的不稳定性而言是一项巨大的挑战。借助CrunchBase等广泛数据库的出现，结合可用的开放数据，可以应用机器学习和人工智能进行更准确的预测分析。本文聚焦于创业公司在B轮和C轮投资阶段，旨在预测关键的成功里程碑，如实现首次公开募股（IPO），达到独角兽地位，或成功实施并购。我们提出了一种新颖的深度学习模型来预测创业公司的成功，整合了各种因素，如资金指标、创始人特征和行业类别。我们研究的一个独特特点是使用了一种全面的回溯算法来模拟风险投资的投资过程。这种模拟允许对我们模型的性能进行针对历史数据的强大评估。",
