    "abstract": "Research on politically motivated unrest and sovereign risk overlooks whether and how unrest location matters for sovereign risk in geographically extensive states. Intuitively, political violence in the capital or nearby would seem to directly threaten the state's ability to pay its debts. However, it is possible that the effect on a government could be more pronounced the farther away the violence is, connected to the longer-term costs of suppressing rebellion. We use Tsarist Russia to assess these differences in risk effects when unrest occurs in Russian homeland territories versus more remote imperial territories. Our analysis of unrest events across the Russian imperium from 1820 to 1914 suggests that unrest increases risk more in imperial territories. Echoing current events, we find that unrest in Ukraine increases risk most. The price of empire included higher costs in projecting force to repress unrest and retain the confidence of the foreign investors financing those costs.",

    "translated_abstract": "关于政治动荡和主权风险的研究忽视了动荡地点对于地理辽阔的国家主权风险的影响及其机制。在直观上，首都或附近的政治暴力似乎直接威胁到国家偿还债务的能力。然而，远离暴力地点可能会更加严重地影响政府，与抑制叛乱所带来的长期成本有关。我们利用沙俄的案例来评估俄罗斯国土内发生动荡与帝国边疆地区发生动荡时风险效应的差异。我们分析了1820年至1914年间沙俄帝国各地的动荡事件，发现动荡对帝国边疆地区的风险影响更大。与当前事件相呼应，我们发现乌克兰的动荡使风险增加最多。帝国的代价包括了向镇压动荡和获得外国投资者信任的同时维持力量投射的高额成本。",
    "tldr": "该论文研究了政治动荡和主权风险对于地理辽阔的国家的影响，并发现在帝国边疆地区发生的动荡更容易增加风险。研究结果对于我们理解当前事件有启示，也提醒着我们在维护国家稳定与吸引外国投资方面所面临的挑战。"
