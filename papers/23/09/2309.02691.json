    "abstract": "Key to tasks that require reasoning about natural language in visual contexts is grounding words and phrases to image regions. However, observing this grounding in contemporary models is complex, even if it is generally expected to take place if the task is addressed in a way that is conductive to generalization. We propose a framework to jointly study task performance and phrase grounding, and propose three benchmarks to study the relation between the two. Our results show that contemporary models demonstrate inconsistency between their ability to ground phrases and solve tasks. We show how this can be addressed through brute-force training on ground phrasing annotations, and analyze the dynamics it creates.

    "translated_abstract": "在需要对视觉背景中的自然语言进行推理的任务中，关键是将单词和短语与图像区域联系起来。然而，即使通常预期以有助于泛化的方式解决任务，观察到当代模型中的这种定位也是复杂的。我们提出了一个框架来共同研究任务执行和短语定位，并提出了三个基准来研究两者之间的关系。我们的结果表明，当代模型在定位短语和解决任务的能力之间存在不一致性。我们展示了如何通过对定位标注进行强制性训练来解决这个问题，并分析了它所创建的动态。代码可在https://github.com/lil-lab/phrase_grounding获得。",
