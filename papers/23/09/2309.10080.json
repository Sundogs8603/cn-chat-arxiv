    "abstract": "If checks and balances are aimed at protecting citizens from the government's abuse of power, why do they sometimes weaken them? We address this question in a laboratory experiment in which subjects choose between two decision rules: with and without checks and balances. Voters may prefer an unchecked executive if that enables a reform that, otherwise, is blocked by the legislature. Consistent with our predictions, we find that subjects are more likely to weaken checks and balances when there is political gridlock. However, subjects weaken the controls not only when the reform is beneficial but also when it is harmful.",

    "translated_abstract": "如果制衡旨在保护公民免受政府滥用权力的侵害，为什么有时它们会削弱制衡机制呢？本实验通过实验室实验来探讨这个问题，实验对象需要在两种不同的决策规则之间选择：具有和没有制衡机制。如果不受制衡的行政部门能够推动由立法机构阻挠的改革，选民可能更倾向于支持无制衡的行政部门。与我们的预测相一致，当政治僵局存在时，我们发现实验对象更倾向于削弱制衡机制。然而，实验对象不仅在改革有益时削弱制衡机制，也在改革有害时削弱它们。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过实验研究发现，当政治僵局存在时，人们更倾向于削弱制衡机制，但并不仅仅是在改革有益时削弱，也包括在改革有害时削弱。",
