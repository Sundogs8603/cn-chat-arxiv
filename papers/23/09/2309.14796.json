    "translated_abstract": "知识追踪（KT）旨在基于问题解决历史追踪学习熟练度，以便为我们提供一套流畅的课程。最近的研究积极利用基于注意力的机制来捕捉问题的相关性，并结合学习者的特征来进行响应。然而，我们的实证研究表明，现有的基于注意力的KT模型忽略了学习者的遗忘行为，尤其是当互动历史变得更长时。这个问题源于过度优先考虑问题的相关性，无意中忽视了遗忘行为的影响。本文提出了一个简单但有效的解决方案，即考虑遗忘的线性偏差（FoLiBi），以反映遗忘行为作为线性偏差。尽管简单，但FoLiBi通过有效地分解问题的相关性和遗忘行为，可以方便地与现有的注重型KT模型配合使用。将FoLiBi与几个KT模型结合使用可以获得一致的改进",
    "tldr": "本文提出了FoLiBi方法，通过考虑学习者的遗忘行为作为线性偏差的形式，结合现有的注重型知识追踪（KT）模型，解决了现有模型忽略学习者遗忘行为的问题，实验结果显示与多个KT模型结合使用可以显著提高效果",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes FoLiBi, a method that addresses the issue of existing knowledge tracing models neglecting learners' forgetting behavior. By considering forgetting behavior as a linear bias and combining it with existing attentive KT models, FoLiBi achieves consistent improvements in performance, as shown in experimental results."
