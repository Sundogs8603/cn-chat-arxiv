    "translated_abstract": "隐喻和讽刺是我们高度进化的社交沟通技巧的珍贵成果。然而，亚斯伯格综合征的儿童众所周知在理解讽刺方面存在困难，即使他们具有足够理解隐喻的口语智商水平。鉴于此，已经使用了一个评分测试来评估理解隐喻和讽刺的能力，以区分亚斯伯格综合征和其他表现相似外部行为的症状（例如注意力缺陷/多动障碍）。本研究使用标准化测试来研究最近大型语言模型（LLMs）理解人类微妙交流的能力。结果显示，随着模型参数数量的增加，它们理解隐喻的能力得到了改善，但并没有观察到对讽刺理解的改进。这意味着有必要采取其他方法来使LLMs具备理解讽刺的能力，这已与亚斯伯格综合征相关。",
