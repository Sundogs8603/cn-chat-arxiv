    "translated_abstract": "增材搅拌摩擦沉积（AFSD）是一种新型的固态增材制造技术，它解决了传统粉末床熔炼和定向能量沉积方法中存在的孔隙率、开裂和性能各向异性等问题。然而，AFSD中的工艺参数、热量分布和得到的显微结构之间的相关性仍然不够清楚，这妨碍了性能的工艺优化。本研究运用了一种先进的框架，将监督机器学习（SML）和基于物理的神经网络（PINNs）相结合，以从工艺参数预测AFSD中的峰值温度分布。对于SML建模，使用了八种回归算法，而对于PINNs，使用了运输、波传播、热传导和量子力学的控制方程。在多个统计指标上，集成的机器学习方法表现出了较好的性能，梯度提升法是最佳的SML方法，最低的均方误差为165.78。",
