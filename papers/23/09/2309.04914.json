    "abstract": "In contrast to the abundant research focusing on large-scale models, the progress in lightweight semantic segmentation appears to be advancing at a comparatively slower pace. However, existing compact methods often suffer from limited feature representation capability due to the shallowness of their networks. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight segmentation architecture, called Multi-scale Feature Propagation Network (MFPNet), to address the dilemma. Specifically, we design a robust Encoder-Decoder structure featuring symmetrical residual blocks that consist of flexible bottleneck residual modules (BRMs) to explore deep and rich muti-scale semantic context. Furthermore, taking benefit from their capacity to model latent long-range contextual relationships, we leverage Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to facilitate multi-scale feature propagation between the BRM blocks. When evaluated on benchmark datasets, our proposed approach shows superior segmentation results.",

    "translated_abstract": "与大规模模型的丰富研究相比，轻量级语义分割的进展似乎进展较慢。然而，现有的紧凑方法由于网络的浅层而导致特征表示能力有限。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的轻量级分割架构，称为多尺度特征传播网络（MFPNet），以解决这一困境。具体而言，我们设计了一种强大的编码器-解码器结构，采用对称的残差块，其中包含灵活的瓶颈残差模块（BRM），以探索深度和丰富的多尺度语义上下文。此外，利用图卷积网络（GCNs）建模潜在的长程上下文关系能力，促进了BRM块之间的多尺度特征传播。在基准数据集上评估时，我们提出的方法显示出优越的分割结果。",
