    "abstract": "We introduce the Cambridge Law Corpus (CLC), a corpus for legal AI research. It consists of over 250 000 court cases from the UK. Most cases are from the 21st century, but the corpus includes cases as old as the 16th century. This paper presents the first release of the corpus, containing the raw text and meta-data. Together with the corpus, we provide annotations on case outcomes for 638 cases, done by legal experts. Using our annotated data, we have trained and evaluated case outcome extraction with GPT-3, GPT-4 and RoBERTa models to provide benchmarks. We include an extensive legal and ethical discussion to address the potentially sensitive nature of this material. As a consequence, the corpus will only be released for research purposes under certain restrictions.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了剑桥法律语料库（CLC），这是一个用于法律人工智能研究的语料库。它包含了来自英国的超过250,000个法庭案例。大部分案例来自21世纪，但该语料库包括了16世纪以来的案例。本文介绍了该语料库的首次发布，包括原始文本和元数据。在语料库的基础上，我们提供了638个案例的法律专家对案例结果的注解。我们使用我们的标注数据，训练和评估了GPT-3、GPT-4和RoBERTa模型进行案例结果提取，以提供基准。我们还进行了广泛的法律和伦理讨论，以解决这些材料可能具有敏感性的问题。因此，该语料库只会在一定限制下用于研究目的。",
