    "abstract": "By sampling from the latent space of an autoencoder and decoding the latent space samples to the original data space, any autoencoder can simply be turned into a generative model. For this to work, it is necessary to model the autoencoder's latent space with a distribution from which samples can be obtained. Several simple possibilities (kernel density estimates, Gaussian distribution) and more sophisticated ones (Gaussian mixture models, copula models, normalization flows) can be thought of and have been tried recently. This study aims to discuss, assess, and compare various techniques that can be used to capture the latent space so that an autoencoder can become a generative model while striving for simplicity. Among them, a new copula-based method, the Empirical Beta Copula Autoencoder, is considered. Furthermore, we provide insights into further aspects of these methods, such as targeted sampling or synthesizing new data with specific features.",

    "translated_abstract": "通过从自动编码器的潜在空间中采样，并解码潜在空间样本到原始数据空间，任何自动编码器都可以简单地转化为生成模型。为了实现这一点，需要用一个可以获得样本的分布来建模自动编码器的潜在空间。可以考虑几种简单的可能性（核密度估计、高斯分布）和更复杂的方法（高斯混合模型、Copula模型、规范化流），并且近期已经尝试过。本研究旨在讨论、评估和比较可以用于捕捉潜在空间的各种技术，以便使自动编码器成为一个生成模型，并追求简单性。其中，考虑了一种新的基于Copula的方法，即经验Beta Copula自动编码器。此外，我们提供了关于这些方法的其他方面的深入见解，如有针对性的采样或合成具有特定特征的新数据。",
