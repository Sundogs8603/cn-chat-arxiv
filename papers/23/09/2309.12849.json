    "abstract": "The traditional machine learning models to solve optimal power flow (OPF) are mostly trained for a given power network and lack generalizability to today's power networks with varying topologies and growing plug-and-play distributed energy resources (DERs). In this paper, we propose DeepOPF-U, which uses one unified deep neural network (DNN) to solve alternating-current (AC) OPF problems in different power networks, including a set of power networks that is successively expanding. Specifically, we design elastic input and output layers for the vectors of given loads and OPF solutions with varying lengths in different networks. The proposed method, using a single unified DNN, can deal with different and growing numbers of buses, lines, loads, and DERs. Simulations of IEEE 57/118/300-bus test systems and a network growing from 73 to 118 buses verify the improved performance of DeepOPF-U compared to existing DNN-based solution methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "传统的机器学习模型解决最优功率流问题多用于给定的电力网络，并且缺乏对当前具有不同拓扑和日益增长的即插即用分布式能源资源的电力网络的泛化性。本文提出了DeepOPF-U，它使用一个统一的深度神经网络来解决不同电力网络中的交流最优功率流问题，包括一个不断扩展的电力网络集合。具体而言，我们为不同网络中给定负荷和最优功率流解的向量设计了弹性输入层和输出层。所提出的方法使用单个统一的深度神经网络，可以处理不同和不断增长的母线、线路、负荷和分布式能源资源的数量。IEEE 57/118/300母线测试系统的仿真以及一个从73个母线增长到118个母线的网络验证了DeepOPF-U相比已有的基于深度神经网络的解决方法的改进性能。",
