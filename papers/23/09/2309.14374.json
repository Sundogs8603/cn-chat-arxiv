    "translated_abstract": "将监管文件或建筑法规解释为可计算机处理的格式对于智能设计和建造建筑和基础设施至关重要。虽然自动化规则解释（ARI）方法已经研究多年，但其中大部分方法都严重依赖于从建筑法规中早期和手动筛选可解释条款。 虽然其中少数方法考虑了从条款和文档层面上的机器可解释性，但这代表了将其转化为可计算机处理格式的潜力。因此，本研究旨在提出一种新的方法，自动评估和增强单个条款和建筑法规的机器可解释性。首先，引入了几个类别，以考虑对规则解释的要求对每个建筑法规条款进行分类，并开发了一个数据集来进行模型训练。然后，基于预训练的领域特定语言的高效文本分类模型被开发出来。",
