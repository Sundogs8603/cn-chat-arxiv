    "translated_abstract": "准确获取兴趣点（POI）的人群流量对于有效的交通管理、公共服务和城市规划至关重要。尽管如此重要，但由于城市感知技术的限制，大多数数据源的数据质量不足以监测每个POI的人群流动。这使得从低质量数据中推断准确的人群流量成为一项关键且具有挑战性的任务。这一复杂性主要由三个关键因素引起：1）标记数据的稀缺性和罕见性；2）POI之间复杂的时空依赖关系；3）精确人群流量与GPS报告之间的众多相关性。为了应对这些挑战，我们将人群流推断问题重新构建为自监督属性图表示学习任务，并引入一种新的时空数据对比自监督学习框架（model）。我们的方法从构建一个空间图开始。",
