    "translated_abstract": "药物再定位是一种发现现有药物新治疗用途的有前途的策略，近年来在计算科学文献中使用生物医学数据库进行了广泛探索。然而，药物再定位候选物的技术潜力经常被忽视。本研究提出了一种新的方法，综合分析药物专利和生物医学数据库等多种信息源，识别具有技术潜力和科学证据的药物再定位候选物。首先，我们构建了一个科学的生物医学知识图谱（s-BKG），包括来自生物医学数据库的药物、疾病和基因之间的关系。我们的方法涉及识别在s-BKG中与目标疾病关联有限但在空间上紧密相邻的药物作为潜在的药物候选物。然后，我们通过添加药物专利信息构建了一个基于专利的生物医学知识图谱（p-BKG）。",
