    "abstract": "Low carbon synfuel can displace transport fossil fuels such as diesel and jet fuel and help achieve the decarbonization of the transportation sector at a global scale, but large-scale cost-effective production facilities are needed. Meanwhile, nuclear power plants are closing due to economic difficulties: electricity prices are too low and variable to cover their operational costs. Using existing nuclear power plants to produce synfuels might prevent loss of these low-carbon assets while producing synfuels at scale, but no technoeconomic analysis of this Integrated Energy System exist. We quantify the technoeconomic potential of coupling a synthetic fuel production process with five example nuclear power plants across the U.S. to explore the influence of different electricity markets, access to carbon dioxide sources, and fuel markets. Coupling synfuel production increases nuclear plant profitability by up to 792 million USD(2020) in addition to a 10 percent rate of return on investmen",

    "translated_abstract": "低碳合成燃料可以取代柴油和喷气燃料等传统燃料，有助于全球范围内实现交通领域的脱碳，但需要大规模的成本效益高的生产设施。与此同时，由于经济困难，核电站正在关闭：电力价格过低且不稳定，无法覆盖运营成本。利用现有核电站生产合成燃料可能阻止这些低碳资产的损失，同时大规模生产合成燃料，但目前尚无关于这种整合能源系统的技术经济分析。我们量化了在美国五个示例核电站与合成燃料生产过程耦合的技术经济潜力，以探究不同电力市场、二氧化碳资源的获取以及燃料市场的影响。将合成燃料生产与核电站耦合可以使核电站的盈利能力增加多达7.92亿美元（2020年），同时获得10％的投资回报率。",
