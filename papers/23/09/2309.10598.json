    "translated_abstract": "跨语言实体对齐是在不同语言的知识图谱中找到相同语义实体的任务。在本文中，我们提出了一种简单而新颖的无监督跨语言实体对齐方法。我们利用深度学习多语言编码器结合机器翻译器来编码知识图谱文本，减少对标签数据的依赖。与仅强调全局或局部对齐的传统方法不同，我们的方法同时考虑了两种对齐策略。我们首先将对齐任务视为一个二分匹配问题，然后采用重新交换的思想来完成对齐。与仅给出一个最优解的传统二分匹配算法相比，我们的算法生成了有排名的匹配结果，这使得许多潜在的下游任务成为可能。此外，我们的方法可以在二分匹配过程中适应两种不同类型的优化（最小和最大），从而提供更多的灵活性。",
