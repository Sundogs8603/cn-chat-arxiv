    "translated_abstract": "脚本对话，如电影和电视字幕，构成了会话自然语言处理模型的广泛训练数据源。然而，这些对话的语言特点与自发交互的语料库中观察到的语言特点明显不同。特别是在交流反馈和落地现象（如回应、确认或澄清要求）方面，这种差异尤为明显。这些信号被认为是会话流程的重要组成部分，并由对话参与者用于对彼此之间正在进行的交互的感知提供反馈。本文在英语、法语、德语、匈牙利语、意大利语、日语、挪威语和中文的对话数据基础上，进行了这类交流反馈现象的定量分析。我们提取了词汇统计和使用神经对话行为标记器获得的分类输出。本文的主要发现有两个方面。",
    "tldr": "本文通过对英语、法语、德语、匈牙利语、意大利语、日语、挪威语和中文的脚本对话和自发对话数据进行量化分析，研究了交流反馈现象。研究发现这些对话类型在交流反馈和落地现象方面存在明显差异。",

The study finds significant differences in communicative feedback and grounding phenomena between the two types of dialogues."
