    "translated_abstract": "随着视频游戏进化为广阔、细致的世界，视觉质量变得至关重要，但也日益具有挑战性。传统的测试方法由于资源有限，难以应对大量潜在的错误。机器学习提供了可扩展的解决方案，然而，对大型标注数据集的严重依赖仍然是一个制约因素。针对这一挑战，我们提出了一种新的方法，利用未标注的游戏玩法和领域特定的增强技术生成用于预训练或多任务设置的数据集和自监督目标，用于后续的视觉错误检测。我们的方法使用弱监督技术扩大量表和促进自主和交互式弱监督，包括基于无监督聚类和/或基于文本和几何提示的交互式方法。我们在广阔的Giantmap游戏世界中展示了对一人称玩家剪辑/碰撞错误（FPPC）的检测，证明了我们的方法的有效性",
