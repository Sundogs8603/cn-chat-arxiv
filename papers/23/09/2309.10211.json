    "abstract": "We consider how human-centered causal theories and tools from the dynamical systems literature can be deployed to guide the representation of data when training neural networks for complex classification tasks. Specifically, we use simulated data to show that training a neural network with a data representation that makes explicit the invariant structural causal features of the data generating process of an epidemic system improves out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization performance on a classification task as compared to a more naive approach to data representation. We take these results to demonstrate that using human-generated causal knowledge to reduce the epistemic uncertainty of ML developers can lead to more well-specified ML pipelines. This, in turn, points to the utility of a dynamical systems approach to the broader effort aimed at improving the robustness and safety of machine learning systems via improved ML system development practices.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑如何使用以人为中心的因果理论和来自动力系统文献的工具，来引导神经网络在复杂分类任务中训练数据的表示。具体而言，我们使用模拟数据来展示，使用将数据生成过程的不变结构因果特征明确显示在数据表示中的神经网络训练，相比于更为天真的数据表示方法，能够提高在分类任务中的超出分布（OOD）泛化性能。我们认为这些结果表明，利用人生成的因果知识来减少机器学习开发者的认识不确定性，可以导致更加明确规范的机器学习流程。这进而指示了通过改进机器学习系统开发实践来提高机器学习系统的鲁棒性和安全性的更广泛努力中的动力系统方法的实用性。",
