In this chapter, we introduce the main mechanisms behind automatic sentence processing systems step by step and then focus on evaluating discourse connective processing. We assess nine popular systems in their ability to understand English discourse connectives and analyze how context and language understanding tasks affect their connective comprehension.

    "translated_abstract": "在过去几年中，自然语言处理（NLP）的能力和使用情况显著增长。尽管已经有很多研究致力于理解人类如何处理话语连接词，但对计算系统中的这一现象的研究还不够。因此，很重要的是将NLP模型置于显微镜下，检查它们是否能够充分理解、处理和推理自然语言的复杂性。在本章中，我们逐步介绍了自动句子处理系统的主要机制，然后着重评估了话语连接词的处理。我们评估了九个流行的系统在理解英语话语连接词方面的能力，并分析了上下文和语言理解任务如何影响它们的连接词理解。结果表明，NLP系统不能同样好地处理所有的话语连接词，并且不同连接词种类的计算处理复杂性并不总是相同。",
