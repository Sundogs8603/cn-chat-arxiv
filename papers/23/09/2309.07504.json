    "translated_abstract": "连接自主车辆(CAVs)有望提高城市交通的安全性、效率和可持续性。然而，这取决于CAV能否正确预测周围运动的代理者，并安全规划自己的运动。在复杂的城市环境中，由于频繁的遮挡和多个代理者之间的相互作用，这一点具有挑战性。其中一个解决方案是利用智能基础设施来增强CAV的情境意识；本文利用最近提出的“自监督交通指导器”(SSTA)智能传感器框架，让其自己生成和广播有用的路用户视频预测。在本研究中，将SSTA预测修改为预测未来的占用情况，而不是原始视频，从而减少广播预测的数据占用量。得到的预测结果在规划框架中使用，证明这种设计可以有效地辅助CAV的运动规划。多种数值实验研究了关键因素。",
