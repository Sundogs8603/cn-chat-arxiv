    "translated_title": "提升模仿学习用于自动驾驶的交通规则遵守的关键因素",
    "translated_abstract": "最近越来越多的研究关注于全端到端的自动驾驶技术，在这种技术中，整个驾驶流程被替换为一个简单的神经网络，由于其结构简单和推理时间快，因此变得非常吸引人。尽管这种方法大大减少了驾驶流程中的组件，但其简单性也导致解释性问题和安全问题。训练得到的策略并不总是符合交通规则，同时也很难发现其错误的原因，因为缺乏中间输出。同时，传感器对于自动驾驶的安全性和可行性也至关重要，可以帮助感知复杂驾驶场景下的周围环境。本文提出了一种全新的基于惩罚的模仿学习方法P-CSG，结合语义生成传感器融合技术，以提高端到端自动驾驶的整体性能。我们对模型的性能进行了评估。",
