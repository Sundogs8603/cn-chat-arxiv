    "abstract": "Public data has been frequently used to improve the privacy-accuracy trade-off of differentially private machine learning, but prior work largely assumes that this data come from the same distribution as the private. In this work, we look at how to use generic large-scale public data to improve the quality of differentially private image generation in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and provide an improved method that uses public data effectively. Our method works under the assumption that the support of the public data distribution contains the support of the private; an example of this is when the public data come from a general-purpose internet-scale image source, while the private data consist of images of a specific type. Detailed evaluations show that our method achieves SOTA in terms of FID score and other metrics compared with existing methods that use public data, and can generate high-quality, photo-realistic images in a differentially private manner.",

    "translated_abstract": "公共数据经常被用来改善差分隐私机器学习的隐私-准确性权衡，但是先前的工作主要假设这些数据与私有数据来自相同的分布。在本研究中，我们研究了如何使用通用的大规模公共数据来提高生成对抗网络（GANs）中差分隐私图像生成的质量，并提供了一种有效利用公共数据的改进方法。我们的方法基于这样一个假设，即公共数据分布的支持集包含了私有数据的支持集；一个例子是公共数据来自通用型的互联网规模图像源，而私有数据由特定类型的图像组成。详细评估结果显示，与使用公共数据的现有方法相比，我们的方法在FID得分和其他指标上达到了最先进水平，并能够以差分隐私的方式生成高质量、逼真的图像。",
