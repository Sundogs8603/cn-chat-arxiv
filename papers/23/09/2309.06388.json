To address these issues, many computational approaches have been suggested for predicting the relationship between drugs and diseases through drug repositioning, aiming to reduce the cost, development cycle, and risks associated with developing new drugs. Researchers have explored different computational methods to predict drug-disease associations, including drug side effects-disease associations, drug-target associations, and miRNAdisease associations. In this comprehensive review, we focus on recent advances in predicting drug-disease association methods for drug repositioning.

    "translated_abstract": "在近几十年中，传统的药物研发面临着高成本、长周期和高风险等挑战。为了解决这些问题，许多计算方法已被提出用于预测药物和疾病之间的关系，从而通过药物再定位来降低新药研发的成本、周期和风险。研究人员探索了不同的计算方法来预测药物-疾病关联，包括药物副作用-疾病关联、药物靶点关联和miRNA-疾病关联。在这篇综述中，我们关注于预测药物再定位中药物-疾病关联方法的最新进展。我们首先将这些方法分为几个类别，包括基于神经网络的算法、基于矩阵的算法、推荐算法、基于链接的推理算法以及文本挖掘和语义推理。然后，我们比较了已有方法的预测性能。",
