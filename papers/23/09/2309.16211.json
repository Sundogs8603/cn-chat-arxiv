    "translated_abstract": "最近，数据中心人工智能的新概念强调了数据在构建AI系统中的作用。不幸的是，在现实世界中，数据集可能会包含脏样本，例如来自后门攻击的毒样本，众包中的噪声标签，甚至是它们的混合体。这些脏样本的存在使得DNNs变得脆弱和不可靠。因此，检测脏样本以提高数据集的质量和可靠性至关重要。现有的检测器只关注检测毒样本或噪声标签，当处理来自其他领域的脏样本时，往往容易出现弱泛化。在本文中，我们发现各种脏样本之间的一个共同性是图像和相关标签之间的视觉和语言之间的不一致性。为了捕捉模态之间的语义不一致性，我们提出了一种多功能数据清洁器(VDC)，利用跨模态对齐和推理的多模态大型语言模型(MLLM)的超过能力。它由...（此处省略）",
