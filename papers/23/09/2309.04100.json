    "translated_abstract": "目的：DMI（Deuterium Metabolic Imaging）的空间分辨率和最小扫描时间受到可达到的信噪比的限制。本研究提出了一种用于增强DMI敏感性的深度学习方法。方法：设计了一个卷积神经网络（CNN）来估计低信噪比和失真的DMI FID的2H标记代谢物浓度。CNN使用合成数据进行训练，这些数据代表通常在体内遇到的一系列信噪比水平。通过对每个DMI数据集使用基于MRI的边缘保护正则化进行CNN的微调，进一步提高了估计精度。提出的处理方法，称为PRECISE-DMI（PReserved Edge ConvolutIonal neural network for Sensitivity Enhanced DMI），应用于模拟研究和体内实验，评估了在SNR上预期的改进，并研究了可能的不准确性。结果：PRECISE-DMI在低信噪比数据集的代谢图像上有着明显的改善，并提高了参数的质量。",
