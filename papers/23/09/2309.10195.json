    "translated_abstract": "从稀疏用户交互中学习有效的推荐模型是发展现代顺序推荐方法中的一个基本挑战。最近，基于预训练的方法已被开发出来来解决这个问题。这些方法的关键思想是通过预训练从相关任务（即辅助任务）中学习可迁移的知识，并将该知识调整到目标任务（即目标任务）中以减轻数据稀疏性问题，从而实现更准确的推荐。然而，尽管有所潜力，本文中我们展示了现有方法存在的恶名昭著的负迁移问题，即通过预训练模型调整的模型在目标任务中表现比从头开始学习的模型更差。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了一种被称为ANT的可迁移顺序推荐方法。与现有方法相比，ANT通过以下方式减轻了负迁移问题：1）结合多模态项目信息，inc",
