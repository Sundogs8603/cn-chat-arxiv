    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种轻量级的不确定性估计器，通过将共形预测与深度学习回归器相结合，能够预测多模态（不重叠）的不确定性边界。我们特别讨论了在视觉里程计（VO）中的应用，其中环境特征（例如飞行域对称性）和传感器测量在模糊和遮挡下会导致多模态的不确定性。我们的仿真结果表明，在我们的框架中，不确定性估计可以根据具有挑战性的操作条件（如噪声、有限的训练数据和预测模型参数的有限大小）进行样本适应。我们还开发了一个推理框架，利用这些稳健的不确定性估计，并结合基于光流的推理来提高预测准确性。因此，通过适当考虑数据驱动学习的预测不确定性，并通过基于规则的推理来闭环估计，我们的方法始终能够提供稳定的结果。",
