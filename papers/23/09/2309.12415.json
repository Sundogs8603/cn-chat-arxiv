To solve this problem, we formalize it as a discrete combinatorial optimization problem and utilize multivalued decision diagrams (MDD), a well-known data structure to deal with constraints. In our context, one key strength of MDD is to compute an exhaustive set of solutions without performing any search. Once the sentences are obtained, we apply a language model (GPT-2) to keep the best ones. We detail this for English and also for French where the agreement and conjugation rules are known to be more complex. Finally, with the help of GPT-2, we get hundreds of bona-fide candidate sentences. When compared with the few dozen sentences usually available in the well-known vision screening test (MNREAD), this brings a major breakthrough in the field of standardized sentence generation.

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种生成强约束文本的新方法。我们考虑了用于视力筛查的标准化句子生成应用。为了解决这个问题，我们将其形式化为一个离散组合优化问题，并利用多值决策图(MDD)，这是一种处理约束的著名数据结构。在我们的环境中，MDD的一个关键优势是可以计算出不需要进行任何搜索的详尽解集。一旦获得了句子，我们应用了一个语言模型(GPT-2)来保留最佳的句子。我们详细介绍了英语和法语的情况，其中一些一致和变位规则被认为更复杂。最后，借助于GPT-2，我们得到了数百个真正的候选句子。与在著名的视力筛查测试(MNREAD)中通常可用的几十个句子相比，这在标准化句子生成领域带来了重大突破。此外，由于可以轻松调整该方法适应不同的语言和约束，因此具有广泛的适用性。",
