    "translated_abstract": "蜂窝网络中的交通预测对于优化第五代(5G)及更高版本的网络至关重要，准确的预测对于智能网络设计、资源分配和异常缓解是必不可少的。虽然机器学习(ML)是一种有效预测网络流量的方法，但大规模数据的集中存储在单个数据中心中，涉及到机密性、隐私和数据传输的问题。为了解决这些挑战，联合学习(FL)作为一种吸引人的ML训练框架应运而生，通过并行分布式计算提供高精度的预测。然而，这些方法的环境影响常常被忽视，这引发了对于其可持续性的质疑。本文通过提出一种新的可持续性指标，解决了联合学习中准确性和能源消耗之间的折衷问题，并对最先进的方法进行了全面评估。",
