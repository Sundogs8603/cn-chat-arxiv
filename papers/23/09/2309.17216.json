    "abstract": "Despite the popularity of conditional cash transfers in low- and middle-income countries, evidence on their long-term effects remains scarce. This paper assesses the impact of the Ecuador's Human Development Grant on the formal sector labour market outcomes of children in eligible households. This grant -- one of the first of its kind -- is characterised by weak enforcement of its eligibility criteria. By means of a regression discontinuity design, we find that this programme increased formal employment rates and labour income around a decade after exposure, thereby curbing the intergenerational transmission of poverty. We discuss possible mediating mechanisms based on findings from previous literature and, in particular, provide evidence on how the programme contributed to persistence in school in the medium run.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管有条件现金转移在低收入和中等收入国家很受欢迎，但对其长期效果的证据仍然很少。本文评估了厄瓜多尔人类发展津贴对符合资格家庭子女在正式部门劳动力市场结果上的影响。这项津贴是最早的一种，其符合资格标准的执行力度较弱。通过回归不连续性设计的方法，我们发现这个计划在暴露后约十年之后增加了正式雇佣率和劳动收入，从而抑制了贫困的代际传递。我们根据以前的文献研究结果讨论可能的中介机制，并提供证据表明这个计划如何在中期促进了学校的持久性。",
