    "translated_abstract": "最近已经证明全球深度学习天气预测模型能够产生与操作中心使用基于物理的模型相媲美的预测。目前不清楚这些模型是否编码了大气动力学，还是只是进行了模式匹配以获得最小的预测误差。回答这个问题对于确定这些模型作为基础科学工具的实用性至关重要。在这里，我们对一个名为Pangu-weather的模型进行了一系列四个经典的动力学实验，这些实验与模型训练数据不相似。我们对模型输出和初始条件施加局部扰动，并加入恒定的时间平均条件，以评估信号自局部源点传播的速度和结构演化。通过添加恒定的热源来扰动模型物理，结果显示在加热区域附近有经典的松野-吉尔响应，并有向外层热带放射的行星波。在冬季均值上施加局部扰动将产生球对称波和地转波等静止波，-简称MJO。",
