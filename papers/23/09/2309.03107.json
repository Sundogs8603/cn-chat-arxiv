    "translated_abstract": "近年来，机器学习已成功应用于科学计算的各个领域。本研究提出了一种稀疏径向基函数神经网络方法，用于解决具有多尺度系数的椭圆偏微分方程（PDE）。受深度混合残差方法的启发，我们将二阶问题重写为一阶系统，并采用多个径向基函数神经网络（RBFNNs）来逼近系统中的未知函数。为了避免由于RBFNN的简单性而导致的过拟合，我们在损失函数中引入了额外的正则化项。因此，损失函数包含两部分：用于一阶系统和边界条件残差的L2损失，以及径向基函数（RBFs）的权重的L1正则化项。引入了一种优化特定损失函数的算法来加速训练过程。通过实验证明了所提方法的准确性和有效性。",
