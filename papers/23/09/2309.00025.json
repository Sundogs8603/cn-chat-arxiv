    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一组依赖度量方法，这些方法是非线性的、局部的，在边际值的广泛变换下具有不变性，可以显示尾部和风险的不对称性，总是有明确定义的，易于估计，并且可以应用于任何数据集。我们提出了一个非参数估计器，并证明了其一致性和渐近正态性。因此，我们在资产定价和统计学中使用的现有（极端的）依赖度量的基础上，显著改进了这些方法。为了展示其实际效用，我们在高频股票回报数据中使用了这些度量方法，包括2010年的Flash Crash和全球金融危机期间。与广泛使用的相关性相反，我们发现我们的度量方法清楚地显示出这些压力情况下的尾部不对称性、非线性、缺乏多样化以及风险内生性的累积。此外，我们的度量方法预测了Flash Crash期间的大规模（联合）损失，同时也预测了市场的反弹并标志了随后的市场脆弱性。",
