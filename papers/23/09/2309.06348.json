    "translated_abstract": "基于图的神经网络，特别是消息传递神经网络（MPNNs），在预测固体材料的物理性质方面显示出巨大的潜力。在这项工作中，我们首先使用来自AFLOW数据库的密度泛函理论数据通过MPNN对材料进行分类，判断其金属或半导体/绝缘体属性。然后，我们进行神经架构搜索，探索MPNN的模型架构和超参数空间，以预测被识别为非金属材料的带隙。搜索中的参数包括消息传递步骤的数量、潜在空间的大小和激活函数等。从搜索中筛选出的表现最佳的模型被汇总成一个集合，显著优于现有文献中的模型。使用蒙特卡洛Dropout和集成方法对不确定性进行量化，集成方法表现更好。我们分析了集成模型在晶体系统、晶格尺寸和其他材料特性方面的适用性范围。",
