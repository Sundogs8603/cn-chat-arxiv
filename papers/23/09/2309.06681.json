    "translated_abstract": "磁共振成像（MRI）在现代医学诊断中起着重要作用，但扫描时间较长。当前的深度学习方法在图像去混叠方面表现良好，可以根据特定的k空间欠采样场景进行定制化。但是当采样设置发生变化时，配置不同的深度网络非常麻烦。本文提出了一种基于插拔式深度学习方法的欠采样MRI重建方法，可以有效适应不同的采样设置。具体来说，首先通过一个在合成数据上训练的深度去噪网络学习图像去混叠先验知识，然后将学习到的深度去噪网络插入到迭代算法中进行图像重建。通过对体内数据的结果验证，该方法在不同的欠采样模式和采样率下提供了良好而稳健的加速图像重建性能，从视觉和定量指标上均得到了证明。",
