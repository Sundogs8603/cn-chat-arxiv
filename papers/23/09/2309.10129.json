    "translated_abstract": "去中心化交易所（DEX）是去中心化金融（DeFi）的基石，允许用户在无需第三方授权的情况下交易加密货币。投资者有动力将资产存入流动性池，用户可以直接与流动性提供者进行交易，并支付费用。然而，与资本效率和市场风险相关的一些未解决问题阻碍了DeFi的进一步发展。Uniswap V3是一项领先而开创性的DEX项目，通过使流动性提供者将流动性集中在特定价格范围内，解决了资本效率问题。然而，这种方法加剧了市场风险，因为只有当资产价格在这些预定的价格范围内时，流动性提供者才能获得交易费用。为了减轻这个问题，本文引入了一种深度强化学习（DRL）解决方案，旨在自适应调整价格范围，最大化利润并减轻市场风险。我们的方法还能够抵消价格变动。",
