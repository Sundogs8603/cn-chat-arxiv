    "translated_abstract": "5G引入了模块化的网络功能(NFs)，以更灵活、弹性地支持新兴服务。为了减少这种模块化NF管理中的复杂性，自动化的网络操作和管理是必不可少的，因此第三代合作伙伴计划(3GPP)引入了网络数据分析功能(NWDAF)。然而，传统的NWDAF需要进行推理和训练任务，因此很难及时地将分析结果提供给NF，尤其是在增加的分析请求数量下。在本文中，我们提出了一个层级网络数据分析框架(H-NDAF)，其中推理任务分布在多个叶子NWDAF上，训练任务在根NWDAF上进行。使用开源软件(free5GC)进行的大量仿真结果表明，与传统的NWDAF相比，H-NDAF可以提供足够准确的分析结果，并且分析提供时间更快。",
