    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一个离线学习问题，其中一个代理首先从静态数据集中估计未知的价格冲击核，然后设计策略以平仓风险资产同时产生短暂的价格冲击。我们提出了一种新颖的方法，通过包含相关价格轨迹、交易信号和元订单的数据集对传播者进行非参数估计。我们使用一个取决于数据集的度量标准来量化估计传播器的准确性。我们表明，一个仅基于估计的传播者使用贪婪策略来尽量减少交易成本的交易者会由于交易策略与估计器之间所谓的伪相关性以及由于有偏成本功能引起的固有不确定性而遇到次优性。通过采用离线强化学习方法，我们引入了一个悲观的损失功能，将估计的传播器的不确定性考虑在内，并带有优化器。",
