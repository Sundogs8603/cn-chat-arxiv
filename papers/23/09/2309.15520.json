    "translated_abstract": "心肌梗死（MI）是冠状动脉疾病（CAD）的严重情况，其检测对于防止心肌组织的进一步损伤至关重要。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的视图融合模型，名为自注意力融合网络（SAF-Net），用于从多视角超声心动图记录中检测MI。所提出的框架利用顶部二腔心室（A2C）和顶部四腔心室（A4C）视图超声心动图记录进行分类。从两个视图的每条记录中提取三个参考帧，并使用预训练的深度网络提取高度代表性的特征。SAF-Net模型利用自注意力机制学习提取特征向量中的依赖关系。所提出的模型由三个主要部分组成，具有紧凑的体系结构：特征嵌入以减少维度，自注意力进行视图池化，密集层进行分类。实验评估使用HMC数据集进行。",
