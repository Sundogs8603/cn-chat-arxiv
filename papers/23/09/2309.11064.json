Consequently, in this preliminary exploratory investigation, we examine how linguistic factors in prompts, specifically readability, formality, and concreteness, influence the occurrence of hallucinations.

    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLM）的发展，它们引发了新的挑战，其中突出的问题之一是LLM的幻觉现象。虽然出现了各种缓解技术来解决幻觉问题，但深入研究其根本原因同样至关重要。因此，在这个初步的探索性调查中，我们研究了提示语言因素，特别是可读性、形式化和具体性，对幻觉发生的影响。我们的实验结果表明，具有更高形式化和具体性的提示倾向于减少幻觉现象。然而，与可读性相关的结果有些不确定，显示出了混合的模式。",
