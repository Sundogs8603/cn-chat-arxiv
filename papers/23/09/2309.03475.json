    "abstract": "Planning and prediction are two important modules of autonomous driving and have experienced tremendous advancement recently. Nevertheless, most existing methods regard planning and prediction as independent and ignore the correlation between them, leading to the lack of consideration for interaction and dynamic changes of traffic scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose InteractionNet, which leverages transformer to share global contextual reasoning among all traffic participants to capture interaction and interconnect planning and prediction to achieve joint. Besides, InteractionNet deploys another transformer to help the model pay extra attention to the perceived region containing critical or unseen vehicles. InteractionNet outperforms other baselines in several benchmarks, especially in terms of safety, which benefits from the joint consideration of planning and forecasting. The code will be available at https://github.com/fujiawei0724/InteractionNet.",

    "translated_abstract": "规划和预测是自动驾驶中的两个重要模块，并且最近有了巨大的进展。然而，大多数现有方法将规划和预测视为独立的，忽略它们之间的相关性，导致缺乏对交互和交通场景的动态变化的考虑。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了InteractionNet，它利用Transformer在所有交通参与者之间共享全局上下文推理，以捕捉交互并将规划和预测互联起来实现联合。此外，InteractionNet还部署了另一个Transformer，帮助模型额外关注包含关键或未见车辆的感知区域。InteractionNet在几个基准测试中优于其他基线，特别是在安全性方面，这得益于对规划和预测的联合考虑。代码将在https://github.com/fujiawei0724/InteractionNet上提供。",
