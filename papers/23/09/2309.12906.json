    "translated_abstract": "可解释的图神经网络（GNN）已经被开发并应用于药物-蛋白质结合预测，以识别与目标蛋白质有活跃相互作用的药物中的关键化学结构。然而，当前可解释的GNN模型所识别出的关键结构通常是化学上无效的。此外，需要手动选择一个阈值来从其他结构中确定关键结构。为了克服当前可解释的GNN模型的局限性，我们提出了SLGNN，即使用稀疏学习来构建图神经网络。我们的SLGNN依赖于使用基于化学亚结构的图（其中节点是化学亚结构）来表示药物分子。此外，SLGNN将广义融合套索与消息传递算法相结合，以识别对药物-蛋白质结合预测至关重要的连接亚图。由于使用了基于化学亚结构的图，因此保证了药物中的任何亚图可以由化学亚结构组成。",
