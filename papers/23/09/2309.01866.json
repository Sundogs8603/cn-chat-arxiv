    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of the Android operating system has made malicious Android applications an appealing target for attackers. Machine learning-based (ML-based) Android malware detection (AMD) methods are crucial in addressing this problem; however, their vulnerability to adversarial examples raises concerns. Current attacks against ML-based AMD methods demonstrate remarkable performance but rely on strong assumptions that may not be realistic in real-world scenarios, e.g., the knowledge requirements about feature space, model parameters, and training dataset. To address this limitation, we introduce AdvDroidZero, an efficient query-based attack framework against ML-based AMD methods that operates under the zero knowledge setting. Our extensive evaluation shows that AdvDroidZero is effective against various mainstream ML-based AMD methods, in particular, state-of-the-art such methods and real-world antivirus solutions.",

    "translated_abstract": "安卓操作系统的广泛应用使得恶意安卓应用成为攻击者的吸引目标。基于机器学习（ML）的安卓恶意软件检测方法在解决这个问题上至关重要；然而，它们对对抗性样本的脆弱性引起了关注。目前对ML-based AMD方法的攻击表现出卓越的性能，但是这些攻击依赖于在实际场景中可能不现实的强假设，例如特征空间、模型参数和训练数据集的知识需求。为了解决这个限制，我们引入了AdvDroidZero，一种对ML-based AMD方法的高效查询式攻击框架，在无知识环境下工作。我们的广泛评估表明，AdvDroidZero对各种主流ML-based AMD方法具有很强的攻击效果，特别是最先进的方法和实际的杀毒软件解决方案。",
