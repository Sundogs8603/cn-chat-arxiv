    "translated_abstract": "人们常常误以为，由于评估指标对搜索引擎结果页面（SERP）可以自由选择分数，因此对于 SERP 对的相对顺序也有类似的自由度。事实上，在很大程度上，这种第二类自由度是虚幻的。这是因为如果对于一对 SERP 中的一个已经被评估指标给予了特定的分数，许多情况下基本的排序约束则决定了对于第二个 SERP 的分数要么不小于，要么不大于给予第一个 SERP 的分数。我们将这种固定的关系称之为固有的 SERP 对排序。本文的第一个目标是描述和辩护这些 SERP 对关系约束，并通过详尽和经验性的实验来统计它们的相对发生情况。然后，我们考虑如何在信息检索实验中应用这些固有的 SERP 对关系，从而提出了一种新的测量范式。",
