    "translated_abstract": "基因的必需性是指基因对生物体的生存和繁殖效果的必要程度。尽管非编码基因的必需性已经有所记录，但我们对非编码基因的必需性仍然存在一些未知的方面。例如，我们不知道序列特征和网络空间特征对必需性的贡献。因此，在这项工作中，我们提出了DeepHEN，它可以回答上述问题。通过建立一个新的长链非编码RNA-蛋白质-蛋白质网络，并利用表示学习和图神经网络，我们成功构建了DeepHEN模型，可以预测长链非编码RNA基因的必需性。与其他预测长链非编码RNA基因必需性的方法相比，我们的DeepHEN模型不仅可以确定序列特征或网络空间特征对必需性的影响更大，还可以解决这些方法由于必需性较少而导致的过度拟合问题。",
