    "translated_abstract": "作为智能交通系统（ITS）的重要组成部分，车联网（IoV）在缓解交通问题方面发挥着重要作用。物体检测是IoV中的关键技术之一，通过分析及时敏感的车辆相关信息，广泛用于提供交通管理服务。然而，当前的物体检测方法大多基于集中式深度训练，即边缘设备获取的敏感数据需要上传到服务器，引发了隐私问题。为了减轻此隐私泄露，我们首先提出了基于联合学习的框架，在中央服务器上共享训练良好的本地模型。然而，由于边缘设备通常计算能力有限，并且车联网对低延迟有严格要求，因此我们进一步提出了边缘设备上的稀疏训练过程，可以有效减轻模型负担，并确保其在边缘设备上的训练效率，从而减少延迟。",
