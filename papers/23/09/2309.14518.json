    "translated_abstract": "时间序列分类在许多领域中都是必不可少的，如医学、金融、环境科学和制造业，可以实现疾病诊断、异常检测和股价预测等任务。尽管循环神经网络和InceptionTime等机器学习模型在许多应用中取得了成功，但由于训练需求的繁重，可能会面临可扩展性限制。为了解决这个问题，出现了Rocket及其衍生模型等随机卷积核模型，通过利用从时间序列数据中随机生成的大量特征，简化训练并实现最先进的性能。然而，由于其随机性质，生成的大部分特征是冗余或非信息性的，增加了不必要的计算负载并损害了泛化能力。在这里，我们引入了顺序特征分离（SFD）作为一种识别和修剪这些非主要特征的方法。SFD利用模型系数来估计特征的重要性。",
