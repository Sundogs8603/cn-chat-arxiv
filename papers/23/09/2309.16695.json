An investigation of insured losses caused by windstorms is a multipurpose study that serves to advance the resilience and sustainability of modern communities. The present study proposes a systematic analysis of insured losses imposed by different types of windstorms in two Canadian provinces, Ontario (ON) and Quebec (QC), during the period 2008-2021. Actual wind damage data from the Canadian insurance market were considered in this study. Our calculations show that ON and QC received half of all wind catastrophes across Canada, and nearly three-quarters of all types of catastrophes in ON and QC were wind-related ones. The total windstorm loss of over CA$5.2 billion was not evenly distributed between QC and ON, but rather had a QC:ON ratio of 1:3.1. We attributed this discrepancy in the inflicted damage between two provinces to the predominantly eastward and northeastward storm trajectories and the hi",

    "translated_abstract": "强烈的风暴对人们、人造结构和环境构成威胁。对由风暴引起的保险损失的调查是一项多功能研究，有助于提高现代社区的抵御能力和可持续性。本研究提出了对加拿大安大略省和魁北克省在2008-2021年期间不同类型风暴引起的保险损失进行系统分析。本研究考虑了加拿大保险市场的实际风害数据。我们的计算显示，安大略省和魁北克省接收到加拿大一半的风灾，而安大略省和魁北克省的风灾占了全部灾害的近四分之三。超过52亿加元的风暴损失在魁北克省和安大略省之间并不均匀分布，而是以1:3.1的比例分布。我们将两个省份之间的损坏差异归因于主要的东向和东北向的风暴轨迹和海",
