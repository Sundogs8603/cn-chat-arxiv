    "abstract": "We present DictaLM, a large-scale language model tailored for Modern Hebrew. Boasting 7B parameters, this model is predominantly trained on Hebrew-centric data. As a commitment to promoting research and development in the Hebrew language, we release both the foundation model and the instruct-tuned model under a Creative Commons license. Concurrently, we introduce DictaLM-Rab, another foundation model geared towards Rabbinic/Historical Hebrew. These foundation models serve as ideal starting points for fine-tuning various Hebrew-specific tasks, such as instruction, Q&A, sentiment analysis, and more. This release represents a preliminary step, offering an initial Hebrew LLM model for the Hebrew NLP community to experiment with.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了DictaLM，这是一个专为现代希伯来语量身定制的大规模语言模型。该模型拥有70亿个参数，主要训练于希伯来语相关数据。为了促进希伯来语的研究和发展，我们以Creative Commons许可证发布了基础模型和训练模型。同时，我们还引入了DictaLM-Rab，另一个针对拉比/历史希伯来语的基础模型。这些基础模型可作为各种希伯来语特定任务（如说明、问答、情感分析等）的理想起点进行微调。此发布代表了一个初步步骤，为希伯来语NLP社区提供了一个初始的希伯来语LLM模型用于实验。",
