    "translated_abstract": "从野外可穿戴设备的无处不在的传感中提取信息对于增强人类福祉具有巨大的潜力，从诊断临床病症和测量压力到构建自适应健康促进支架。但是，不同上下文中的大量数据对传统的监督学习方法提出了挑战。表示学习从生物信号中是一个新兴的领域，得益于计算建模的最新进展和公开共享数据库的丰富。心电图（ECG）是这一领域中研究的主要模态，其在健康监测、压力和情感估计方面具有应用。然而，大多数研究都受到小规模受控数据收集和过参数化架构选择的限制。我们介绍了一种名为\\textbf{WildECG}的预训练状态空间模型，用于从ECG信号中进行表示学习。我们以无处不在收集的275,000个10秒ECG记录为训练数据，在无监督方式下训练该模型，并进行评估。",
