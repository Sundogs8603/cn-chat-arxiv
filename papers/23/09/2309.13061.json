    "translated_abstract": "发表的生物医学信息数量不断增加。自然语言处理(NLP)的最新进展引起了人们对自动提取、规范化和表示生物医学实体(如基因和疾病)知识的浓厚兴趣。本研究分析了基因和疾病领域的生殖细胞系摘要，用于构建知识图谱以展示这一领域的大量工作。本文介绍了一种名为SimpleGermKG的自动知识图谱构建方法，将生殖细胞系基因和疾病联系起来。我们使用了在生物医学语料库上预训练的BioBERT模型来提取基因和疾病，提出了一种基于本体和规则的算法来规范化和消歧义医学术语。对于文章、基因和疾病之间的语义关系，我们实现了一种部分-整体关系方法来将每个实体与其数据源连接并以图形化知识展示。",
