    "translated_abstract": "在开放域对话系统中，对话中的NSFW（不适合上班）内容可能对用户产生严重影响。然而，在对话上下文中检测NSFW语言，尤其是性爱内容方面的研究明显滞后。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了CensorChat，一个旨在检测NSFW对话的对话监控数据集。利用涉及GPT-4和ChatGPT的知识蒸馏技术，该数据集提供了一种经济高效的构建NSFW内容检测器的方法。该过程涉及收集真实的人机交互数据，并将其分解为单个话语和单轮对话，其中聊天机器人提供最后一句话。使用ChatGPT对无标签数据进行注释，作为训练集。使用ChatGPT和GPT-4作为注释器构建了合理性验证集和测试集，并使用自我批评策略解决标记中的差异。BERT模型用于微调。",
