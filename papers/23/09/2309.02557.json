    "translated_abstract": "中心对象分区（PAM，k-Medoids）是一种常用的聚类技术，适用于任意距离函数或相似度，每个聚类由其最中心的对象（称为medoid或离散中值）代表。在运营研究中，这类问题也被称为设施定位问题（FLP）。FastPAM最近引入了一种针对较大k的加速技术，使其适用于更大的问题，但该方法的运行时间仍为N的平方。在本章中，我们讨论了这个问题的稀疏和不对称变种，例如用于道路网络等图形数据。通过利用稀疏性，我们可以避免二次运行时间和内存要求，并使该方法可扩展到更大的问题，只要我们能够构建一个足够连接的小图形来进行局部优化。此外，我们还考虑了不对称情况，其中medoid的集合与要覆盖的点的集合不相同。",
