    "translated_abstract": "由于视频中物体的运动，有效计算注意力图对于视频来说是具有挑战性的。虽然标准的非局部搜索对于每个查询点周围的窗口具有高质量，但窗口的大小无法容纳运动。长程运动的方法使用辅助网络预测与每个查询位置的偏移量最相似的关键坐标。然而，准确预测此偏移的光流场仍然具有挑战性，即使对于大规模网络也是如此。小的空间不准确性会严重影响注意力模块的质量。本文提出了一种将非局部搜索的质量与预测的偏移量范围相结合的搜索策略。这种方法被命名为偏移非局部搜索，它在预测的偏移周围执行一个小的网格搜索，以纠正小的空间误差。我们的方法的原地计算消耗的内存比先前的工作少了10倍，速度快了3倍以上。在实验中，纠正了小的空间误差",
