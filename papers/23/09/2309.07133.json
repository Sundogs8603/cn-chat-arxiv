Then, we quantified the ability of wearable-based machine-learning models to predict poor cognition based on outcomes from the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease Word-Learning subtest (CERAD-WL), and the Animal Fluency Test (AFT). We found that the wearable-based models had significantly higher AUCs when predicting all three cognitive outcomes compared to benchmark models containing age, sex, education, marital status, household income, diabetic status, depressio",

    "translated_abstract": "进行认知测试对患者和临床医生来说非常耗时。基于可穿戴设备的预测模型可以在正常生活条件下进行持续的健康监测，并可以作为早期干预认知障碍老年人的一种替代方法。在本研究中，我们首先提取了与生物钟节律、环境光照暴露、身体活动水平、睡眠和信号处理相关的新颖可穿戴特征。然后，我们评估了基于可穿戴设备的机器学习模型根据数字符号替代测试（DSST）、建立阿尔茨海默病登记簿学习子测验（CERAD-WL）和动物流利性测试（AFT）的结果来预测认知能力较差的能力。我们发现，与包含年龄、性别、教育水平、婚姻状况、家庭收入、糖尿病状态和抑郁状况等基准模型相比，基于可穿戴设备的模型在预测三个认知结果时具有显着更高的AUC。",
