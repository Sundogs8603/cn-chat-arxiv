    "abstract": "This paper presents the results of the shared task on Lay Summarisation of Biomedical Research Articles (BioLaySumm), hosted at the BioNLP Workshop at ACL 2023. The goal of this shared task is to develop abstractive summarisation models capable of generating \"lay summaries\" (i.e., summaries that are comprehensible to non-technical audiences) in both a controllable and non-controllable setting. There are two subtasks: 1) Lay Summarisation, where the goal is for participants to build models for lay summary generation only, given the full article text and the corresponding abstract as input; and 2) Readability-controlled Summarisation, where the goal is for participants to train models to generate both the technical abstract and the lay summary, given an article's main text as input. In addition to overall results, we report on the setup and insights from the BioLaySumm shared task, which attracted a total of 20 participating teams across both subtasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了在ACL 2023的BioNLP研讨会上举办的关于生物医学研究文章简化摘要的共享任务（BioLaySumm）的结果。该共享任务的目标是开发能够生成“常规摘要”（即可理解给非技术人员的摘要）的抽象化摘要模型，无论在可控或不可控的环境中。共享任务包括两个子任务：1）常规摘要，参与者需要根据提供的完整文章文本和对应的摘要作为输入，构建产生常规摘要的模型；2）可读性控制的摘要，参与者需要根据文章的主要文本作为输入，训练模型来生成技术摘要和常规摘要。除了总体结果，我们还报告了BioLaySumm共享任务的设置和见解，共有20个参与团队参与了这两个子任务。",
