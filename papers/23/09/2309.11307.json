    "abstract": "Predicting the success of Conversational Task Assistants (CTA) can be critical to understand user behavior and act accordingly. In this paper, we propose TB-Rater, a Transformer model which combines conversational-flow features with user behavior features for predicting user ratings in a CTA scenario. In particular, we use real human-agent conversations and ratings collected in the Alexa TaskBot challenge, a novel multimodal and multi-turn conversational context. Our results show the advantages of modeling both the conversational-flow and behavioral aspects of the conversation in a single model for offline rating prediction. Additionally, an analysis of the CTA-specific behavioral features brings insights into this setting and can be used to bootstrap future systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "预测对话任务助手（CTA）的成功对于理解用户行为并相应地采取行动至关重要。在本文中，我们提出了TB-Rater，这是一个Transformer模型，它将对话流特征与用户行为特征相结合，用于预测CTA场景中的用户评分。特别地，我们使用了在Alexa TaskBot挑战中收集的真实人-机对话和评分，这是一个新颖的多模态和多轮对话环境。我们的结果显示，将对话流和行为方面的特征模型化为单一模型对于离线评分预测具有优势。此外，对CTA特定行为特征的分析为这种设置带来了洞察，并且可以用于启动未来的系统。",
