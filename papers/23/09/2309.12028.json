    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了交通流量预测问题，旨在基于过去的道路网络和交通状况来预测未来的交通条件。通常通过使用时空图神经网络（GNN）来建模交通数据中的复杂时空相关性来解决这个问题。然而，这些方法的性能仍然不令人满意，因为当涉及到复杂的交通网络时，GNNs的表示能力通常有限。图形本质上无法捕捉非配对关系。更糟糕的是，现有的方法都遵循信息传递的范式，线性地聚合邻域信息，无法捕捉复杂的时空高阶交互作用。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种名为动态超图结构学习(DyHSL)的新模型用于交通流量预测。为了学习非配对关系，我们的DyHSL提取超图结构信息来进行建模。",
