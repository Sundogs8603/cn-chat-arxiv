    "translated_abstract": "本研究介绍了一种合成高光谱数据集，通过将高光谱和高空间分辨率成像相结合，实现对观测场景或对象的综合、准确和详细的表示。在依赖单一相机时，获得这种理想的品质是具有挑战性的。所提出的数据集通过利用三种模态（RGB、推扫式可见光高光谱相机和快照式红外高光谱相机）来解决这个问题，每种模态都具有不同的空间和光谱分辨率。不同的相机系统具有不同的光度学特性，导致空间和光谱分辨率之间的权衡。RGB相机通常具有高空间分辨率但光谱分辨率有限，而高光谱相机在牺牲空间分辨率的情况下具有高光谱分辨率。此外，高光谱相机本身采用不同的捕获技术和光谱范围，进一步增加了综合获取的复杂性。",
