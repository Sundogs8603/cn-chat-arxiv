    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the problem of learning unknown quantum states in quantum neural networks (QNNs) and presents a no-go theorem. The probability of avoiding local minima exponentially decreases with the number of qubits when the loss value is below a critical threshold, while it only grows polynomially with the circuit depth. The curvature of local minima is concentrated around the product of quantum Fisher information and a loss-dependent constant, which characterizes the sensitivity of the output state to the parameters in QNNs."
