    "translated_abstract": "求职者对劳动市场的错误认知可能扭曲他们的决策，增加长期失业的风险。我们的研究为失业工人的主观工资预期建立了客观基准。这使我们能够提供关于求职者工资预期准确性的新见解。首先，特别是低实际收入潜力的工人倾向于对自己未来的工资持过分乐观的信念，并将工资预期过于强烈地锚定在失业前的工资上。其次，在长期失业的工人中，过度乐观态度将在整个失业期间持续存在。第三，更高的外在激励力促使求职者对工资预期持更乐观的看法，但这并不意味着他们实际得到更高的工资。最后，我们记录了过度乐观的工资预期与求职者高估重新就业机会的倾向之间的联系。我们讨论了这些发现的含义和应用。",
    "tldr": "通过建立客观基准，我们的研究发现，求职者工资预期普遍存在过度乐观的现象，尤其是低收入潜力的工人。与此同时，长期失业者的过度乐观态度会持续存在，并且更高的外在激励并不能转化为更高的实际工资。此外，我们还发现过度乐观的工资预期与求职者高估重新就业机会的倾向存在联系。",

Overoptimism persists among long-term unemployed workers, and higher extrinsic incentives do not translate into higher realized wages. Furthermore, there is a link between overoptimistic wage expectations and job seekers' tendency to overestimate reemployment chances."
