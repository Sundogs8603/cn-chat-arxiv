    "translated_abstract": "随着ChatGPT向公众推广，大型语言模型展示出了令人称奇的常识、推理和规划能力，经常提供有见地的指导。这些能力为它们在城市交通管理和控制中的应用带来了巨大的希望。然而，语言模型在处理交通问题，尤其是处理数值数据和与模拟交互方面面临困难，限制了它们在解决交通相关挑战方面的潜力。与此同时，专门的交通基础模型存在，但通常只用于特定任务，输入输出交互有限。将这些模型与语言模型相结合，可以增强它们处理复杂的交通相关问题和提供有见地建议的能力。为了弥合这一差距，我们提出了TrafficGPT，它是ChatGPT和交通基础模型的融合。这种整合产生了以下关键增强：1）赋予ChatGPT查看、分析、处理数字数据和与交通模拟交互的能力。",
