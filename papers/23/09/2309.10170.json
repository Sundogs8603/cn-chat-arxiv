    "translated_abstract": "蜘蛛丝是一种拥有出色的机械性能（如强度，延展性和轻量化）的材料。然而，到目前为止，仅有有限的模型可用于完全探索序列-性能关系以进行分析和设计。在这里，我们提出了一种定制的生成式语言模型，用于设计新的蜘蛛丝蛋白序列以满足复杂的目标机械性能组合。该模型在大量蛋白序列的预训练基础上进行微调，针对约1,000个主要泡腺丝蛋白（MaSp）序列进行了正向和逆向生成策略的端到端设计。通过以下评估性能：（1）通过BLAST搜索对生成的蜘蛛丝蛋白序列进行新颖性分析和蛋白类型分类，（2）对比类似序列的性能评估和比较，（3）分子结构比较，以及（4）详细的序列基序分析。",
