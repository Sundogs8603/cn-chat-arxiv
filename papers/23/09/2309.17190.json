The key idea is to fully utilize semantic parsing and primitive extraction for constraining and accelerating the radiance field reconstruction process. To fulfill this goal, a primitive-aware hybrid rendering strategy was proposed to enjoy the best of both volumetric and primitive rendering. We further contribute a reconstruction pipeline conducts primitive parsing and radiance field learning iteratively for each input frame which successfully fuses semantic, primitive, and radiance information into a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the fast reconstruction ability, high rendering quality, and convenient editing functionality of our method.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种快速场景辐射场重建方法，具有强大的新视角合成性能和方便的场景编辑功能。其关键思想是充分利用语义解析和基元提取来约束和加速辐射场重建过程。为了实现这一目标，本文提出了一种基元感知混合渲染策略，以充分发挥体素渲染和基元渲染的优点。我们进一步提供了一个重建流程，通过迭代地对每个输入帧进行基元解析和辐射场学习，成功地将语义、基元和辐射信息融合到一个单一的框架中。广泛的评估证明了我们方法的快速重建能力、高渲染质量和方便的编辑功能。",
