    "translated_abstract": "从数据中学习因果效应是科学中一个基础且广泛研究的问题，尤其是当因果关系是静态的时候。然而，在存在跨时间点实体之间依赖的情况下，对动态因果效应的识别较少被探索。与静态情况相比，从时间序列观测中获取动态因果效应的计算复杂度较高。我们展示了对向量自回归 (VAR) 模型恢复因果结构的计算复杂度为 $O(Tn^3N^2)$，其中 $n$ 是节点数，$T$ 是样本数，$N$ 是实体之间的最大时间滞后。我们提出了一种复杂度为 $O(Tn^3\\log N)$ 的方法，用于恢复因果结构以获得频域 (FD) 表示的时间序列。由于FFT将所有时间依赖关系积累在每个频率上，可以高效地进行因果推断。",
