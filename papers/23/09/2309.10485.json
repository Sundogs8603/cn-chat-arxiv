    "translated_abstract": "Grid句子常用于研究Lombard效应和Normal-to-Lombard转换。然而，目前尚不清楚在真实应用中，基于Grid句子训练的Normal-to-Lombard模型是否足以提高自然语音可懂度。本文介绍了一个平行的Lombard语料库（称为Lombard Chinese TIMIT，LCT），并从中提取了中文TIMIT的自然句子。然后，我们使用LCT和Enhanced Mandarin Lombard Grid语料库（EMALG）比较了自然句子和Grid句子在Lombard效应和Normal-to-Lombard转换方面。通过对Lombard效应的参数分析，我们发现随着噪声水平的增加，自然句子和Grid句子的参数变化相似，但在alpha比例增加方面，Grid句子的增加更大。在跨性别和信噪比的主观可懂度评估中，基于EMALG训练的StarGAN模型始终表现优于其他模型。",
