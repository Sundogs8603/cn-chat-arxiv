    "abstract": "The increase in the availability of online videos has transformed the way we access information and knowledge. A growing number of individuals now prefer instructional videos as they offer a series of step-by-step procedures to accomplish particular tasks. The instructional videos from the medical domain may provide the best possible visual answers to first aid, medical emergency, and medical education questions. Toward this, this paper is focused on answering health-related questions asked by the public by providing visual answers from medical videos. The scarcity of large-scale datasets in the medical domain is a key challenge that hinders the development of applications that can help the public with their health-related questions. To address this issue, we first proposed a pipelined approach to create two large-scale datasets: HealthVidQA-CRF and HealthVidQA-Prompt. Later, we proposed monomodal and multimodal approaches that can effectively provide visual answers from medical videos",

    "translated_abstract": "在线视频的增加改变了我们获取信息和知识的方式。越来越多的人现在喜欢使用教学视频，因为它们提供了一系列逐步操作的步骤来完成特定任务。医学领域的教学视频可能提供了关于急救、医疗急症和医学教育问题的最佳视觉答案。本文旨在通过提供医学视频中的视觉答案来回答公众提出的健康相关问题。医学领域缺乏大规模数据集是阻碍开发能够帮助公众解答健康相关问题的应用的关键挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们首先提出了一个流水线方法来创建两个大规模数据集：HealthVidQA-CRF和HealthVidQA-Prompt。接下来，我们提出了单模态和多模态方法，可以有效地从医学视频中提供视觉答案。",
