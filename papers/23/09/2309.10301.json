    "translated_abstract": "领域自适应是一个统计学习问题，当用于训练模型的源数据分布与用于评估模型的目标数据分布不同时出现。虽然许多领域自适应算法已经证明了相当大的实证成功，但是盲目应用这些算法往往会导致在新的数据集上表现更差。为了解决这个问题，重要的是澄清领域自适应算法在具备良好目标性能的假设下。在这项工作中，我们关注在预测中具备条件不变的组件（CICs）的存在假设，这些组件在源数据和目标数据之间保持条件不变。我们证明了CICs，通过条件不变惩罚（CIP）可以估计，具备在领域自适应中提供目标风险保证的三个突出作用。首先，我们提出了一种基于CICs的新算法，即重要性加权的条件不变惩罚（IW-CIP），它在目标风险保证方面超越了简单的方法。",
