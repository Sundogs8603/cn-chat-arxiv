    "translated_abstract": "自动程序修复(APR)对于减少开发者的手动调试工作和提高软件可靠性非常重要。传统的基于搜索的技术通常依赖启发式规则或冗余假设来挖掘修复模式，而近年来，深度学习(DL)方法的兴起以数据驱动的方式自动化程序修复过程。然而，它们的性能常常受到参数模型对APR高度复杂搜索空间建模的限制。为了减轻参数模型的负担，本文提出了一种新颖的检索增强修补生成框架(RAP-Gen)，通过明确利用源自以前的错漏对代码库中检索到的相关修复模式。具体而言，我们构建了一个混合的修补筛选器，以语言无关的方式，基于原始源代码进行词法和语义匹配，不依赖于任何特定于代码的特征。",
