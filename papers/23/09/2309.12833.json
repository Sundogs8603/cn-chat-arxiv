    "translated_abstract": "从观测数据中发现因果关系是一项基本而具有挑战性的任务。在某些应用中，仅学习给定响应变量的因果特征可能已经足够，而不是学习整个潜在的因果结构。不变因果预测（ICP）是一种用于因果特征选择的方法，需要来自异质环境的数据。ICP假设从直接原因生成响应的机制在所有环境中都相同，并利用这种不变性输出一部分因果特征的子集。ICP的框架已经扩展到一般的加性噪声模型和非参数设置，使用条件独立性测试。然而，非参数条件独立性测试经常受到低功率（或较差的类型I错误控制）的困扰，并且上述参数模型不适用于响应不是在连续刻度上测量的应用情况，而是反映了分类信息的情况。",
