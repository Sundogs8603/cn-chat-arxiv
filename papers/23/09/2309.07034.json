    "translated_abstract": "注释者的社会人口背景（即性别，年龄，教育背景等个体组成）对其在主观NLP任务中的决策有很大影响，比如仇恨言论检测。通常，异质的背景会导致高度分歧。为了建模这种差异，最近的研究探索了社会人口提示技术，这种技术将基于提示的模型的输出引导到具有特定社会人口特征的人类可能给出的答案。然而，现有的NLP文献对这种技术的效果存在分歧 - 它仍然不清楚它能在哪些任务和场景中有帮助，并且评估仅限于特定任务。我们通过展示迄今为止最大和最全面的社会人口提示研究来填补这一研究空白。具体来说，我们评估了七个数据集和六个经过指导调整的模型家族中的几个提示形式。我们发现，尽管社会人口提示对某些任务有效，但也存在一些限制和挑战。",
