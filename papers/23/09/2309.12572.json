    "translated_abstract": "轻度颅脑损伤（mTBI）由于其高发病率和潜在的长期健康影响而成为一个重要的公共卫生挑战。尽管计算机断层扫描（CT）是mTBI的标准诊断工具，但在mTBI患者中往往会出现正常结果，尽管存在症状证据。这一事实凸显了准确诊断的复杂性。在本研究中，我们介绍了一种可解释的3D多模态残差卷积神经网络（MRCNN）用于mTBI诊断模型，结合遮蔽敏感度图（OSM）进行增强。我们的MRCNN模型在mTBI诊断方面展现出良好的性能，经由五折交叉验证流程验证，平均准确率为82.4%，灵敏度为82.6%，特异度为81.6%。值得注意的是，与基于CT的残差卷积神经网络（RCNN）模型相比，MRCNN在特异度上提高了4.4%，准确率提高了9.0%。我们展示了OSM在比较CT图像时提供了更好的数据驱动洞察力。",
