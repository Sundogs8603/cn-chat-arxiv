InvestLM shows strong capabilities in understanding financial text and provides helpful responses to investment related questions. Financial experts, including hedge fund managers and research analysts, rate InvestLM's response as comparable to those of state-of-the-art commercial models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Claude-2).

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种新的金融领域大型语言模型InvestLM，该模型通过精心策划的与金融投资相关的指导数据集对LLaMA-65B进行调优。受到“少即是多”的启发，我们手动策划了一个既小又多样的指导数据集，涵盖了从特许金融分析师（CFA）考试问题到SEC文件和Stackexchange量化金融讨论的广泛金融相关主题。InvestLM表现出良好的理解金融文本的能力，并对投资相关问题提供有帮助的回答。包括对冲基金经理和研究分析师在内的金融专家将InvestLM的回答评价为与最先进的商业模型（GPT-3.5、GPT-4和Claude-2）可媲美。对一组金融NLP基准问题进行零样本评估表明了其强大的泛化能力。从研究角度来看，本研究表明可以使用高质量的领域特定LLM进行调优。",
