    "translated_abstract": "合成唱歌声音的兴起给艺术家和行业利益相关者带来了未经授权的声音使用的重要挑战。与合成语音不同，合成唱歌声音通常在包含强烈背景音乐的歌曲中发布，这可能掩盖了合成造成的瑕疵。此外，唱歌声音与语音话语具有不同的声学和语言特征。这些独特的属性使得唱歌声音Deepfake检测成为一个相关但显着不同于合成语音检测的问题。在本文中，我们提出了唱歌声音Deepfake检测任务。首先，我们提供了SingFake，这是一个在野外精选的数据集，包含了40位歌手用五种语言演唱的28.93小时真实音频和29.40小时的Deepfake音频。我们提供了一个训练/验证/测试的划分，其中测试集包括不同的场景。然后，我们使用SingFake评估了四个在语音话语训练的最先进的语音对抗系统。我们发现这些系统在唱歌声音上的表现不同于在语音话语上的表现。",
