    "translated_abstract": "基于基础视觉模型的发展，普通视觉识别已经达到了一个很高的水平，但是不能很好地处理专门领域中的细粒度识别，比如入侵物种分类。识别和管理入侵物种具有很强的社会和生态价值。目前，大多数入侵物种数据集的规模有限，覆盖的物种范围狭窄，这限制了基于深度学习的入侵生物计量系统的发展。为了填补这个领域的空白，我们引入了Species196，一个包含196个类别的大规模半监督数据集。它收集了超过19K带有专家级准确注释的图像Species196-L，以及120万张未标记的入侵物种图像Species196-U。该数据集提供了四种实验设置，用于基准测试现有的模型和算法，分别是监督学习、半监督学习、自监督预训练和大型多模态模型的零样本推理能力。",
