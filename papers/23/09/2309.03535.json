    "abstract": "Diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration pose a significant risk to vision, highlighting the importance of precise segmentation of retinal vessels for the tracking and diagnosis of progression. However, existing vessel segmentation methods that heavily rely on encoder-decoder structures struggle to capture contextual information about retinal vessel configurations, leading to challenges in reconciling semantic disparities between encoder and decoder features. To address this, we propose a novel feature enhancement segmentation network (FES-Net) that achieves accurate pixel-wise segmentation without requiring additional image enhancement steps. FES-Net directly processes the input image and utilizes four prompt convolutional blocks (PCBs) during downsampling, complemented by a shallow upsampling approach to generate a binary mask for each class. We evaluate the performance of FES-Net on four publicly available state-of-the-art datasets: DRIVE, STARE, CH",

    "translated_abstract": "糖尿病视网膜病变和老年性黄斑变性等疾病对视力构成重大危险，强调了对视网膜血管进行精确分割的重要性，以便跟踪和诊断进展情况。然而，现有的依赖编码器-解码器结构的血管分割方法在捕捉视网膜血管配置的上下文信息方面存在困难，导致编码器和解码器特征之间的语义差异难以调和。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的特征增强分割网络（FES-Net），它能够在不需要额外图像增强步骤的情况下实现精确的像素级分割。FES-Net直接处理输入图像，并在下采样过程中利用四个提示卷积块（PCBs），并结合浅层上采样方法为每个类别生成二进制掩码。我们在四个公开的最先进数据集上评估了FES-Net的性能：DRIVE, STARE, CH",
