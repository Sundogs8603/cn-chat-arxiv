    "abstract": "Treatment effect heterogeneity (TEH), or variability in treatment effect for different subgroups within a population, is of significant interest in clinical trial analysis. Causal forests (Wager and Athey, 2018) is a highly popular method for this problem, but like many other methods for detecting TEH, its criterion for separating subgroups focuses on differences in absolute risk. This can dilute statistical power by masking nuance in the relative risk, which is often a more appropriate quantity of clinical interest. In this work, we propose and implement a methodology for modifying causal forests to target relative risk using a novel node-splitting procedure based on generalized linear model (GLM) comparison. We present results on simulated and real-world data that suggest relative risk causal forests can capture otherwise unobserved sources of heterogeneity.",

    "translated_abstract": "在临床试验分析中，治疗效应异质性（TEH）即种群中不同亚群的治疗效应的变异性是非常重要的。因果森林（Wager和Athey，2018）是解决这个问题的一种非常流行的方法，但像许多其他发现TEH的方法一样，它用于分离亚群的标准侧重于绝对风险的差异。这可能会削弱统计功效，掩盖了相对风险中的细微差别，而相对风险通常是临床关注的更合适的数量。在这项工作中，我们提出并实现了一种修改因果森林以针对相对风险的方法，使用基于广义线性模型（GLM）比较的新颖节点分割过程。我们在模拟和真实数据上展示了结果，表明相对风险的因果森林可以捕捉到其他未观察到的异质性源。",
