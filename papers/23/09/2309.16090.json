    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)在规划使用各种功能工具，如计算器和检索器方面表现出了非凡的性能，尤其是在问答任务中。本文扩展了这些工具的定义，重点是对话系统中的概念工具。概念工具指定了一种有助于系统性或调查性思考的认知概念。这些概念工具在实践中发挥重要作用，例如多重心理或辅导策略动态应用于单个回合以组合有用的响应。为了进一步增强LLMs在这些概念工具上的推理和规划能力，我们引入了一种多人物协作框架: Think-Plan-Execute (TPE)。该框架将响应生成过程分解为三个不同的角色: 思考者，规划者和执行者。具体而言，思考者分析对话上下文中表现出的内部状态，例如用户的情绪。",
