    "abstract": "This paper studies the cosine as basis function for the approximation of univariate and continuous functions without memory. This work studies a supervised learning to obtain the approximation coefficients, instead of using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Due to the finite dynamics and orthogonality of the cosine basis functions, simple gradient algorithms, such as the Normalized Least Mean Squares (NLMS), can benefit from it and present a controlled and predictable convergence time and error misadjustment. Due to its simplicity, the proposed technique ranks as the best in terms of learning quality versus complexity, and it is presented as an attractive technique to be used in more complex supervised learning systems. Simulations illustrate the performance of the approach. This paper celebrates the 50th anniversary of the publication of the DCT by Nasir Ahmed in 1973.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了余弦作为基函数用于近似无记忆单变量连续函数的方法。本文使用了监督学习来获取逼近系数，而不是使用离散余弦变换（DCT）。由于余弦基函数的有限动态和正交性，简单的梯度算法，如归一化最小均方（NLMS），可以从中受益，并呈现出可控和可预测的收敛时间和误差不匹配。由于其简单性，该技术在学习质量与复杂性方面位列前茅，并被提出作为更复杂的监督学习系统中使用的一种有吸引力的技术。模拟实验验证了该方法的性能。本文庆祝了1973年Nasir Ahmed发表DCT的50周年。",
