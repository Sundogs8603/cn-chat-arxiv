    "abstract": "Content metadata plays a very important role in movie recommender systems as it provides valuable information about various aspects of a movie such as genre, cast, plot synopsis, box office summary, etc. Analyzing the metadata can help understand the user preferences to generate personalized recommendations and item cold starting. In this talk, we will focus on one particular type of metadata - \\textit{genre} labels. Genre labels associated with a movie or a TV series help categorize a collection of titles into different themes and correspondingly setting up the audience expectation. We present some of the challenges associated with using genre label information and propose a new way of examining the genre information that we call as the \\textit{Genre Spectrum}. The Genre Spectrum helps capture the various nuanced genres in a title and our offline and online experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the approach.

    "translated_abstract": "内容元数据在电影推荐系统中扮演着非常重要的角色，它提供了有关电影的各个方面（如类型、演员、剧情概要、票房摘要等）的有价值信息。分析元数据可以帮助理解用户偏好，生成个性化推荐和解决项目冷启动问题。本文将重点关注一种特定类型的元数据——“类型”标签。电影或电视剧的类型标签有助于将一系列标题分类为不同主题，并相应地设置观众期望。我们提出了使用类型标签信息所涉及的一些挑战，并提出了一种称为“类型频谱”的新方法来研究类型信息。类型频谱有助于捕捉标题中的各种微妙类型，我们的离线和在线实验证实了该方法的有效性。此外，我们还讨论了LLMs在增强内容元数据分析方面的应用。",
