    "abstract": "In multivariate time series systems, lead-lag relationships reveal dependencies between time series when they are shifted in time relative to each other. Uncovering such relationships is valuable in downstream tasks, such as control, forecasting, and clustering. By understanding the temporal dependencies between different time series, one can better comprehend the complex interactions and patterns within the system. We develop a cluster-driven methodology based on dynamic time warping for robust detection of lead-lag relationships in lagged multi-factor models. We establish connections to the multireference alignment problem for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Since multivariate time series are ubiquitous in a wide range of domains, we demonstrate that our algorithm is able to robustly detect lead-lag relationships in financial markets, which can be subsequently leveraged in trading strategies with significant economic benefits.",

    "translated_abstract": "在多变量时间序列系统中，引导-滞后关系揭示了时间序列在彼此相对于时间的平移时的依赖关系。发现这种关系对于下游任务，如控制、预测和聚类，具有很大的价值。通过理解不同时间序列之间的时间依赖性，可以更好地理解系统内复杂的交互和模式。我们基于动态时间规整开发了一种基于聚类的方法，用于在滞后多因子模型中鲁棒地检测引导-滞后关系。我们建立了与均匀和非均匀设置下多参考对齐问题的联系。由于多元时间序列在广泛的领域中普遍存在，我们证明我们的算法能够稳健地检测金融市场中的引导-滞后关系，这在后续的交易策略中具有重要的经济效益。",
