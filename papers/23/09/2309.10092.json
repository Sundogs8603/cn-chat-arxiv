    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了一个新的移动机器人运动规划问题，任务是以自然语言（NL）表达并以时间和逻辑顺序完成多个高级子任务。为了正式定义这样的任务，我们利用基于NL的原子谓词在LTL上定义了模型。这与相关的规划方法形成对比，这些方法在原子谓词上定义了捕捉所需低级系统配置的LTL任务。我们的目标是设计机器人计划，满足基于NL的原子命题定义的LTL任务。在这个设置中出现的一个新的技术挑战在于推理机器人计划的正确性与这些LTL编码的任务的关系。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了HERACLEs，一个分层一致的自然语言规划器，它依赖于现有工具的新型整合，包括（i）自动机理论，以确定机器人应该完成的NL指定的子任务以推进任务进展；",
