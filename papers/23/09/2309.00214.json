    "abstract": "An agent observes the set of available projects and proposes some, but not necessarily all, of them. A principal chooses one or none from the proposed set. We solve for a mechanism that minimizes the principal's worst-case regret. We compare the single-project environment in which the agent can propose only one project with the multiproject environment in which he can propose many. In both environments, if the agent proposes one project, it is chosen for sure if the principal's payoff is sufficiently high; otherwise, the probability that it is chosen decreases in the agent's payoff. In the multiproject environment, the agent's payoff from proposing multiple projects equals his maximal payoff from proposing each project alone. The multiproject environment outperforms the single-project one by providing better fallback options than rejection and by delivering this payoff to the agent more efficiently.",

    "translated_abstract": "一个代理观察到可用项目的集合并提出其中一部分（但不一定全部），然后委托人从提出的集合中选择一个或选择不选。我们解决了最小化委托人最坏后悔的机制问题。我们比较了代理只能提出一个项目的单项目环境和代理可以提出多个项目的多项目环境。在两种环境中，如果代理提出一个项目，则在委托人的回报足够高的情况下，这个项目一定会被选择；否则，这个项目被选择的概率会随着代理的回报而减少。在多项目环境中，代理提出多个项目的回报等于他单独提出每个项目的最大回报。多项目环境通过提供比拒绝更好的备选选项，并且更有效地将这个回报传递给代理，胜过了单项目环境。",
