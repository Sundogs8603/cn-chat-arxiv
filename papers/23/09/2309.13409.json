    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel forecasting strategy that leverages the power of fractional differencing (FD) to capture both short- and long-term dependencies in time series data. Unlike traditional integer differencing methods, FD preserves memory in series while stabilizing it for modeling purposes. By applying FD to financial data from the SPY index and incorporating sentiment analysis from news reports, this empirical analysis explores the effectiveness of FD in conjunction with binary classification of target variables. Supervised classification algorithms were employed to validate the performance of FD series. The results demonstrate the superiority of FD over integer differencing, as confirmed by Receiver Operating Characteristic/Area Under the Curve (ROCAUC) and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) evaluations.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究介绍了一种新颖的预测策略，利用分数差分（FD）的能力来捕捉时间序列数据中的短期和长期依赖关系。与传统的整数差分方法不同，FD在保持系列记忆的同时稳定了它以供建模目的。通过将FD应用于来自SPY指数的金融数据，并结合新闻报道的情感分析，这个实证分析探讨了FD与目标变量的二元分类的效果。采用了监督分类算法来验证FD系列的性能。结果显示，FD相比整数差分具有优越性，这一点通过接收者操作特征/曲线下面积（ROCAUC）和马修斯相关系数（MCC）的评估得到确认。",
