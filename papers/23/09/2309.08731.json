    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于深度学习的新方法，用于改进雷达测量对激光雷达地图的定位。虽然目前定位的技术水平是将激光雷达数据与激光雷达地图进行匹配，但是雷达被认为是一种有前途的替代方法，因为它对降水和大雾等恶劣天气具有更强的韧性。为了利用现有的高质量激光雷达地图，同时在恶劣天气下保持性能，将雷达数据与激光雷达地图进行匹配具有重要意义。然而，由于雷达测量中存在的独特伪影，雷达-激光雷达定位一直难以达到与激光雷达-激光雷达系统相媲美的性能，使其无法用于自动驾驶。本工作在基于ICP的雷达-激光雷达定位系统基础上，包括一个学习的预处理步骤，根据高层次的扫描信息对雷达点进行加权。将经过验证的分析方法与学习到的权重相结合，减小了雷达定位中的误差。",
