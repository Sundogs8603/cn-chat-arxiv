The latter category of methods makes use of Tweedie's formula, which links the posterior mean in Gaussian denoising (i.e., the minimum MSE denoiser) with the score of the data distribution. Here, we derive a fundamental relation between the higher-order central moments of the posterior distribution, and the higher-order derivatives of the posterior mean. We harness this result for uncertainty quantification of pre-trained denoisers. Particularly, we show how to efficiently compute the principal components of the posterior distribution for any desired region of an image, as well as to approximate the full marginal distribution along those (or any other) one-dimensional directions. Our method is fast and memory efficient, as it does not explicitly compute or store the high-order moment tensors and it requires no training or fine tuning of t",

    "translated_abstract": "去噪算法在许多应用中起着核心作用，从降噪低级别成像传感器到提升基于评分的生成模型。后一类方法使用Tweedie公式，将高斯去噪的后验均值（即最小均方误差去噪器）与数据分布的评分链接起来。我们在这里推导了后验分布的高阶中心矩与后验均值的高阶导数之间的基本关系。我们利用这个结果进行预训练去噪器的不确定性量化。特别地，我们展示了如何高效计算图像任何所需区域的后验分布的主成分，以及如何近似沿这些（或任何其他）一维方向的完整边际分布。我们的方法快速且内存高效，因为它不需要显式计算或存储高阶矩张量，并且无需训练或微调。",
