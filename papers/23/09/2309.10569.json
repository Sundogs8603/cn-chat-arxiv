    "translated_abstract": "随着移动应用程序越来越复杂，其中包含的依赖任务越来越流行，这些应用程序通常具有低延迟要求，从而导致对计算资源的需求急剧增加。随着移动边缘计算（MEC）的出现，将应用程序任务卸载到部署在移动网络边缘的小型设备上以获得高质量用户体验成为最重要的问题。然而，由于MEC环境是动态的，大多数依赖专家知识或准确的分析模型的现有工作在任务图离载方面无法完全适应这种环境变化，导致用户体验降低。本文研究了MEC中的任务图离载，考虑到边缘计算设备的计算能力随时间变化。为了适应环境变化，我们将计算离载的任务图调度建模为一个Markov决策过程（Markov Decision Process）。",

Existing works often fail to adapt to environmental changes, resulting in a decrease in user experience. We propose a method of modeling task graph scheduling as a Markov decision process to adapt to the time-varying computation capabilities."
