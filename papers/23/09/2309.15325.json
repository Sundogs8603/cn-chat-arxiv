    "translated_abstract": "目前，科学发现和工程设计受限于物理实验的时间和成本，这些实验通常是通过试验和直觉选择的，并需要深入的领域专业知识。数值模拟是物理实验的替代方法，但对于复杂的现实领域来说，由于现有数值方法的计算需求，通常是不可行的。人工智能（AI）通过开发快速的数据驱动代理模型，提供了一个潜在的范式转变。特别是，一个称为神经运算符的AI框架提供了一个基于连续域函数之间映射学习的原则性框架，例如时空过程和偏微分方程（PDE）。它们可以在训练过程中未见过的新位置进行外推和预测解决方案，即进行零射超分辨率。神经运算符可以增强甚至替代许多应用中的现有模拟器，例如计算力学流体学。",
