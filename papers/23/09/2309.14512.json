    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们考虑了在联邦环境中估计对称矩阵的主子空间（前r个奇异向量的张成）的问题，当每个节点都可以访问对这个矩阵的估计时。我们研究如何使这个问题具有拜占庭鲁棒性。我们引入了一种新颖的可证明的拜占庭鲁棒、通信高效和私密的算法，称为子空间中值算法（Subspace-Median），用于解决这个问题。我们还研究了这个问题的最自然的解法，基于几何中值的修改的联邦幂方法，并解释为什么它是无用的。在这项工作中，我们考虑了鲁棒子空间估计元问题的两个特殊情况 - 联邦主成分分析（PCA）和水平联邦低秩列感知（LRCCS）的谱初始化步骤。对于这两个问题，我们展示了子空间中值算法提供了既具有鲁棒性又具有高通信效率的解决方案。均值的中位数扩展也被开发出来了。",
