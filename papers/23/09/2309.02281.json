We introduce and advocate for a causal inference problem in sub-populations (henceforth called s-ID), in which we merely have access to observational data of the targeted sub-population (as opposed to the entire population). Existing inference problems in sub-populations operate on the premise that the given data distributions originate from the entire population, thus, cannot tackle the s-ID problem. To address this gap, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions that must hold in the causal graph for a causal effect in a sub-population to be identifiable from the observational distribution of that sub",

    "translated_abstract": "在子群体中的因果推断涉及到识别干预对特定子组的因果效应，这些子组通过抽样过程中的系统偏差与整个群体有所区别。然而，忽略子群体引入的细微差别可能导致错误的推断，或者限制现有方法的适用性。我们引入并倡导子群体中的因果推断问题（以下简称s-ID），其中我们仅可以访问目标子群体的观测数据（而不是整个群体）。现有的子群体推断问题是基于给定的数据分布源于整个群体的前提，因此无法解决s-ID问题。为了填补这一差距，我们提供了在因果图中必须满足的必要和充分条件，以便从该子群体的观测分布中识别出子群体中的因果效应。",
