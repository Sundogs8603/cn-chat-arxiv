    "translated_abstract": "360度（全方位）图像提供了一个场景的全景球状视图。最近，在从由数字相机和智能手机捕获的传统窄视场（NFoV）图像合成360度图像方面引起了越来越多的关注，以在各种场景中提供身临其境的体验，如虚拟现实。然而，现有的方法通常无法合成复杂的视觉细节或确保生成的图像与用户提供的提示一致。在这项研究中，提出了一种自回归全方位感知生成网络（AOG-Net），通过使用NFoV和文本引导相结合或单独进行渐进地外扩不完整的360度图像来进行360度图像生成。这种自回归方案不仅允许通过动态生成和调整过程来获取更精细和与文本一致的模式，还为用户在生成过程中编辑条件提供了更大的灵活性。",
