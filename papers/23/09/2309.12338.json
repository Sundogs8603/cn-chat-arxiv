    "translated_title": "人工智能与审美判断",
    "translated_abstract": "生成型人工智能产生以人类表达风格为基础的创造性输出。我们认为，与现代生成型人工智能模型的产出相遇是通过美学判断来调节的，这种判断方式与我们与艺术品的互动相似。我们在博物馆中对艺术品的解释过程并不是人类固有的能力，而是通过艺术史和艺术批评等学科在历史上发展起来来完成某些社会功能的。这使得我们在考虑对生成型人工智能产生的反应时感到困惑，以及我们应该如何接触这种新媒介以及为什么生成型人工智能似乎引发了对未来的许多恐惧。我们自然地继承了艺术史的因果推断难题：一部作品既可以被解读为受到了影响其创作的文化条件的症状，同时又被构建为一种永恒的、似乎非因果的对永恒人类状况的淬取。在本文中，我们关注当这一困境出现时所带来的未解决的紧张关系。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文讨论了生成型人工智能产生的创造性输出与人类审美判断之间的联系，指出人们对于生成型人工智能产生的反应是经由艺术判断来调节的。同时，论文还提到了对于生成型人工智能的反应可能源于对其未来发展的担忧，并探讨了艺术作品因为其文化条件和人类状况的双重解读难题。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper discusses the connection between the creative outputs of generative AI and human aesthetic judgment, highlighting that people's reactions to generative AI are mediated by artistic judgments. It also addresses concerns about the future development of generative AI and explores the dilemma of interpreting art as both a symptom of cultural conditions and a representation of eternal human conditions."
