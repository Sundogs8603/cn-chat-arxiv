    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLM)已被证明可以像规划者一样将高级指令分解为可执行指令的序列。然而，当前基于LLM的规划器只能使用固定的技能集合运作。我们克服了这个关键限制，并提出了一种利用LLM-based规划器查询新技能并以数据和时间高效的方式教授机器人这些技能的方法，用于刚性物体操作。我们的系统可以重复使用新获得的技能用于未来的任务，展示了开放世界和终身学习的潜力。我们在模拟和真实世界中对提出的框架进行了多个任务的评估。视频可在以下网址观看：https://sites.google.com/mit.edu/halp-robot-learning。",
