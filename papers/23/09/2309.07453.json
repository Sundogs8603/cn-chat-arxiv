    "abstract": "The myriad complex systems with multiway interactions motivate the extension of graph-based pairwise connections to higher-order relations. In particular, the simplicial complex has inspired generalizations of graph neural networks (GNNs) to simplicial complex-based models. Learning on such systems requires large amounts of data, which can be expensive or impossible to obtain. We propose data augmentation of simplicial complexes through both linear and nonlinear mixup mechanisms that return mixtures of existing labeled samples. In addition to traditional pairwise mixup, we present a convex clustering mixup approach for a data-driven relationship among several simplicial complexes. We theoretically demonstrate that the resultant synthetic simplicial complexes interpolate among existing data with respect to homomorphism densities. Our method is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world datasets for simplicial complex classification.",

    "translated_abstract": "众多复杂系统中存在着多维交互，这促使我们将基于图的成对连接拓展到高阶关系。特别地，复形复杂网络已经启发了基于复形复杂模型的图神经网络的泛化。在这种系统上的学习需要大量的数据，而这些数据可能难以获取或者成本高昂。我们提出了通过线性和非线性混合机制对复形复杂网络进行数据增强的方法，返回现有标记样本的混合物。除了传统的成对混合，我们还提出了一种凸聚类混合方法，用于描述多个复形复杂网络之间的数据驱动关系。我们在理论上证明了生成的合成复形复杂网络在同态密度方面插值了现有数据。我们的方法在合成和真实数据集上进行了复形复杂分类的实证研究。",

It utilizes linear and nonlinear mixup mechanisms to return mixtures of existing labeled samples, as well as a convex clustering mixup approach for describing data-driven relationships among multiple simplicial complexes. The method shows promising performance in simplicial complex classification."
