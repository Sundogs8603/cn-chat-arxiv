    "abstract": "We investigate the expressive power of deep residual neural networks idealized as continuous dynamical systems through control theory. Specifically, we consider two properties that arise from supervised learning, namely universal interpolation - the ability to match arbitrary input and target training samples - and the closely related notion of universal approximation the ability to approximate input-target functional relationships via flow maps. Under the assumption of affine invariance of the control family, we give a characterisation of universal interpolation, showing that it holds for essentially any architecture with non-linearity. Furthermore, we elucidate the relationship between universal interpolation and universal approximation in the context of general control systems, showing that the two properties cannot be deduced from each other. At the same time, we identify conditions on the control family and the target function that ensures the equivalence of the two notions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过控制理论，研究了将深度残差神经网络理想化为连续动力系统的表达能力。具体而言，我们考虑了来自监督学习的两个性质，即通用插值 - 能够匹配任意输入和目标训练样本 - 以及紧密相关的通用逼近 - 能够通过流动图近似输入-目标函数关系。在控制家族具有仿射不变性的假设下，我们给出了通用插值的刻画，证明了对于具有非线性的任何架构，它都成立。此外，我们阐明了通用插值和通用逼近在一般控制系统背景下的关系，表明这两个性质不能从彼此推导出来。同时，我们确定了控制家族和目标函数的条件，确保了这两个概念的等价性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the interpolation, approximation, and controllability of deep neural networks. Through control theory analysis, it is found that deep residual neural networks have the ability of universal interpolation and universal approximation. However, these two properties cannot be deduced from each other, but under certain conditions, the two properties are also equivalent."
