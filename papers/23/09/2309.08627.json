    "abstract": "There is a lack of quantitative measures to evaluate the progression of topics through time in dynamic topic models (DTMs). Filling this gap, we propose a novel evaluation measure for DTMs that analyzes the changes in the quality of each topic over time. Additionally, we propose an extension combining topic quality with the model's temporal consistency. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed measure by applying it to synthetic data and data from existing DTMs. We also conducted a human evaluation, which indicates that the proposed measure correlates well with human judgment. Our findings may help in identifying changing topics, evaluating different DTMs, and guiding future research in this area.",

    "translated_abstract": "动态主题模型(DTMs)在评估主题随时间变化的进展方面缺乏定量指标。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了一种新颖的DTMs评估方法，该方法分析了每个主题随时间变化的质量变化。此外，我们还提出了结合主题质量和模型时间一致性的扩展方法。我们通过将该方法应用于合成数据和已有DTMs的数据来证明其实用性。我们还进行了人工评估，结果表明该方法与人类判断具有良好的相关性。我们的研究结果有助于识别变化的主题、评估不同的DTMs以及指导未来的研究领域。",
