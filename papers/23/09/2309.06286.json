    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，数据驱动的增材制造（AM）研究取得了显著的成功，产生了大量的科学文献。这些研究中的知识涉及到AM和人工智能（AI）领域，但没有以一种整合的方式进行挖掘和形式化。此外，目前没有支持数据驱动知识从一个上下文迁移到另一个上下文的工具或指南。因此，仅针对特定的AM工艺技术开发和验证了特定的AI技术的数据驱动解决方案。有潜力利用各种AM技术之间的内在相似性，利用AI（如迁移学习）从一个工艺或问题中适应现有的解决方案。我们提出了一种三步知识迁移性分析框架来支持数据驱动的AM知识迁移。作为迁移性分析的先决条件，AM知识被转化为识别出的知识组件。",
