In this paper, we investigate a novel combination of a Gaussian process spatial model and a Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) model.

    "translated_abstract": "在空间统计学中，预测是一个经典的挑战，将空间协变量纳入具有潜在空间效应的模型中可以极大地提高预测性能。我们希望开发出灵活的回归模型，允许在协变量结构中存在非线性和交互作用。机器学习模型已经在空间环境中提出，允许残差中存在空间依赖性，但无法提供可靠的不确定性估计。在本文中，我们研究了高斯过程空间模型和贝叶斯加法回归树（BART）模型的新组合。通过将马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）与嵌套拉普拉斯近似（INLA）技术相结合，降低了方法的计算负担。我们通过模拟研究了该方法的性能，并使用该模型预测在肯尼亚家庭集群样本中收集的人体测量响应。",
