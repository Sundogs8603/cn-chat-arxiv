    "abstract": "Chatbots have become popular in educational settings, revolutionizing how students interact with material and how teachers teach. We present Curriculum-Driven EduBot, a framework for developing a chatbot that combines the interactive features of chatbots with the systematic material of English textbooks to assist students in enhancing their conversational skills. We begin by extracting pertinent topics from textbooks and then using large language models to generate dialogues related to these topics. We then fine-tune an open-source LLM using our generated conversational data to create our curriculum-driven chatbot. User studies demonstrate that our chatbot outperforms ChatGPT in leading curriculum-based dialogues and adapting its dialogue to match the user's English proficiency level. By combining traditional textbook methodologies with conversational AI, our approach offers learners an interactive tool that aligns with their curriculum and provides user-tailored conversation practice.",

    "translated_abstract": "在教育场景中，聊天机器人已经变得流行起来，改变了学生与课程互动和教师授课的方式。我们提出了一种名为课程驱动的教育机器人的框架，该框架将聊天机器人的互动特征与英语教科书的系统材料相结合，帮助学生提高口语技巧。我们首先从教科书中提取相关主题，然后使用大型语言模型生成与这些主题相关的对话。接着，我们使用我们生成的对话数据对开源语言模型进行微调，从而创建我们的课程驱动型聊天机器人。用户研究表明，我们的聊天机器人在引领基于课程的对话和适应用户英语水平方面优于ChatGPT。通过将传统教科书方法与对话式人工智能相结合，我们的方法为学习者提供了一个与课程相匹配并提供用户个性化对话练习的互动工具。",
