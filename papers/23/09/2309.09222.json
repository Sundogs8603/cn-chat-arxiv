    "translated_abstract": "最近，高斯过程被用来建模连续动力系统的向量场。对于这样的模型，贝叶斯推断已经得到了广泛研究，并应用于时间序列预测等任务，提供不确定性估计。然而，先前的高斯过程常微分方程(ODE)模型在具有非高斯过程先验的数据集上可能表现不佳，因为它们的约束先验和均值场后验可能缺乏灵活性。为了解决这个限制，我们引入了标准化流来重新参数化ODE的向量场，从而得到一个更灵活、更表达性的先验分布。此外，由于标准化流的解析可计算的概率密度函数，我们将它们应用于GP ODE的后验推断，生成一个非高斯的后验。通过这些标准化流的双重应用，我们的模型在贝叶斯高斯过程ODE中提高了准确性和不确定性估计。",
