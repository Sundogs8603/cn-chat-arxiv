    "translated_abstract": "算法系统经常被用于协助高风险决策。鉴于此，算法补救措施，即个体应能够针对算法系统产生的不良结果采取行动，受到越来越多的关注。迄今为止，关于算法补救措施的大部分文献主要关注如何为单个个体提供补救，而忽略了一个关键要素：不断变化的环境的影响。忽视这些对补救措施的影响是一个重大的疏忽，因为几乎所有情况下，补救措施都包括个体首次做出不利尝试，然后在以后的某个时间点提供一次或多次尝试的机会 - 当时环境可能已经发生了变化。这可能会产生虚假的期望，因为初始的补救建议随时间的推移可能变得不太可靠，原因是模型漂移和个体之间对有利结果的竞争导致的。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种考虑时间变化的算法补救措施的方法。",
    "tldr": "这项研究关注算法补救措施中忽视的关键要素 - 不断变化的环境对补救效果的影响。研究发现，在时间推移和个体间竞争的情况下，初始的补救建议可能变得不可靠，因此需要考虑时间变化来确保补救的有效性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This research focuses on the overlooked aspect of algorithmic recourse - the impact of the continuously changing context on the effectiveness of recourse. The study finds that in the presence of time dynamics and competition among individuals, initial recourse recommendations may become unreliable, thus highlighting the need to consider temporal changes for ensuring effective recourse."
