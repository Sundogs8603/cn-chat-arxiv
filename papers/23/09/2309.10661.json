    "translated_abstract": "民主化自然语言处理（NLP）技术的访问至关重要，特别是对于被低估和极度资源匮乏的语言。以往的研究侧重于通过在线爬取和文件翻译为这些语言开发带标签和无标签的语料库。尽管这些方法已经被证明是有效和费用效益的，但我们发现所得到的语料库存在一些限制，包括缺乏词汇多样性和与当地社区的文化相关性。为了解决这一差距，我们在印度尼西亚的地方语言上进行了案例研究。我们比较了在线爬取、人工翻译和母语者段落撰写在构建数据集方面的效果。我们的研究结果表明，通过母语者段落撰写生成的数据集在词汇多样性和文化内容方面具有更高的质量。此外，我们还提出了“datasetname ”基准，涵盖了12个被低估和极度资源匮乏的语言。",
