    "translated_abstract": "在光学相干断层扫描血管成像(OCTA)图像分析中，分割特定目标是必要的。现有方法通常在有限样本（大约几百个）的监督数据集上进行训练，这可能导致过拟合。为了解决这个问题，采用低秩适应技术进行基础模型的微调，并提出相应的提示点生成策略，以处理OCTA数据集上的各种分割任务。该方法被命名为SAM-OCTA，并在公开可用的OCTA-500数据集上进行了实验。该方法在实现最先进的性能指标的同时，实现了局部血管分割以及有效的动脉-静脉分割，这在先前的工作中尚未得到很好的解决。代码可在https://github.com/ShellRedia/SAM-OCTA找到。",
