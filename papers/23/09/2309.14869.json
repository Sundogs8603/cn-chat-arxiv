We conducted a study with 338 Polish participants to investigate societal attitudes towards various energy sources, including nuclear energy and renewables. Applying a novel network approach, we identified a multitude of factors influencing energy acceptance. Political ideology is the central factor in shaping public acceptance, however we also found that environmental attitudes, risk perception, safety concerns, and economic variables play substantial roles. Considering the long-term commitment associated with nuclear energy and its role in Poland's energy transformation, our findings provide a foundation for improving energy policy in Poland.

    "translated_abstract": "波兰能源部门目前正经历重大转型，赢得公众支持对其能源政策的成功至关重要。我们通过与338名波兰参与者进行研究，调查了社会对各种能源来源的态度，包括核能和可再生能源。应用了一种新颖的网络方法，我们确定了影响能源接受度的多种因素。政治意识形态是塑造公众接受度的核心因素，然而我们还发现环境态度、风险感知、安全顾虑和经济变量也起着重要作用。鉴于核能的长期承诺和其在波兰能源转型中的角色，我们的研究为改善波兰的能源政策提供了基础。我们的研究强调了与人口的多样化价值观、信仰和偏好相 resonating 的政策的重要性。",
