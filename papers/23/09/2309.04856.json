    "translated_abstract": "生成模型在图像科学中具有潜在的应用，如图像重建、后验采样和数据共享。基于流的生成模型特别有吸引力，因为它们能以可行的方式提供精确的密度估计以及快速、廉价和多样的样本。然而，训练这样的模型需要一个大型、高质量的对象数据集。在计算成像等应用中，由于需要长时间获取或高辐射剂量，往往难以获取这样的数据，而获取这些对象的噪声或部分观测测量更可行。在这项工作中，我们提出了AmbientFlow，一个从噪声和不完整数据直接学习基于流的生成模型的框架。使用变分贝叶斯方法，提出了一个从噪声、不完整数据建立基于流的生成模型的新框架。广泛的数值研究证明了该方法的有效性。",
