    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了多标签场景下的零样本学习（MLZSL）的一个具有挑战性的问题，即模型通过使用已见类和辅助知识（例如语义信息）在一个样本（例如一张图片）中识别多个未见过的类别。现有方法通常通过分析样本中各个已见类的关系（从空间或语义特征的角度），并将学习到的模型迁移到未见类上。但它们忽略了局部和全局特征的有效整合。也就是说，在推理未见类时，全局特征表示图像在特征空间中的主要方向，而局部特征应该在一定范围内保持唯一性。这种整合的忽视会使模型失去对图像主要组成部分的把握。仅在推理阶段依赖于已见类的局部存在会引入不可避免的偏差。在本文中，我们提出一种群体双增强框架，用于解决这个问题。",
