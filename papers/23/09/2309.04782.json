    "translated_abstract": "时间频率分析是许多应用中的一个重要且具有挑战性的任务。傅里叶变换和小波分析是两种经典方法，在许多领域取得了显著的成功。然而，这些方法在处理非线性和非平稳信号时存在一定的局限性。为了应对这一挑战，研究人员提出了一系列非线性和自适应的方法，其中以经验模态分解方法为先驱。它们的目标是将非平稳信号分解为准平稳分量，以在时间频率分析中揭示更好的特征。最近，受深度学习的启发，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，称为残差递归卷积神经网络（RRCNN）。RRCNN不仅可以在对大规模信号进行批处理时实现更稳定的分解，而且还为非平稳信号分解提供了独特的视角。在本研究中，我们旨在借助服务器的帮助进一步改进RRCNN。",
