    "translated_abstract": "超参数优化对于发挥机器学习的潜力至关重要。在实践中，用户通常对多目标问题感兴趣，即优化可能存在冲突的目标，比如准确性和能耗。为了解决这个问题，绝大多数多目标机器学习算法将一组非支配的机器学习模型的帕累托前沿返回给用户。然而，优化这种算法的超参数并不容易，因为评估一个超参数配置涉及评估得到的帕累托前沿的质量。在文献中，已有一些指标可以通过量化不同属性（如体积、与参考点的接近程度）来评估帕累托前沿的质量（例如超体积、R2）。然而，对于用户来说，选择导致期望的帕累托前沿的指标可能是一项困难的任务。在本文中，我们提出了一个以人为中心的交互式超参数优化方法，针对多目标机器学习应用偏好学习。",
