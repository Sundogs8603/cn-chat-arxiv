    "title": "Kid-Whisper: Towards Bridging the Performance Gap in Automatic Speech Recognition for Children VS. Adults. (arXiv:2309.07927v1 [eess.AS])",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, exemplified by Whisper, have demonstrated the potential of these systems to approach human-level performance given sufficient data. However, this progress doesn't readily extend to ASR for children due to the limited availability of suitable child-specific databases and the distinct characteristics of children's speech. A recent study investigated leveraging the My Science Tutor (MyST) children's speech corpus to enhance Whisper's performance in recognizing children's speech. This paper builds on these findings by enhancing the utility of the MyST dataset through more efficient data preprocessing. We also highlight important challenges towards improving children's ASR performance. The results showcase the viable and efficient integration of Whisper for effective children's speech recognition.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近自动语音识别（ASR）系统的进展，例如Whisper，展示了这些系统在足够的数据条件下接近人类水平的性能潜力。然而，这一进展并不适用于儿童ASR，原因是适用于儿童的专用数据库的可用性有限，且儿童语音具有与成人不同的特征。最近的一项研究调查了利用My Science Tutor（MyST）儿童语音语料库提高Whisper识别儿童语音的性能。本文在这些研究结果的基础上，通过更有效的数据预处理增强了MyST数据集的实用性。我们还强调了改进儿童ASR性能的重要挑战。结果展示了将Whisper有效整合到儿童语音识别中的可行性和高效性。",
