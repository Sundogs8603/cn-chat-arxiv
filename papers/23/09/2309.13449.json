    "abstract": "This study analyses the tax-induced profit shifting behaviour of firms and the impact of governments' anti-shifting rules. We derive a model of a firm that combines internal sales and internal debt in a full profit shifting strategy, and which is required to apply the arm's length principle and a general thin capitalisation rule. We find several cases where the firm may shift profits to low-tax countries while satisfying the usual arm's length conditions in all countries. Internal sales and internal debt may be regarded either as complementary or as substitute shifting channels, depending on how the implicit concealment costs vary after changes in all transactions. We show that the cross-effect between the shifting channels facilitates profit shifting by means of accepted transfer prices and interest rates.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究分析了企业的税收诱导利润转移行为以及政府反转移规则的影响。我们推导了一个模型，该模型将内部销售和内部债务结合起来形成一个完整的利润转移策略，并要求应用独立定价原则和普遍薄资本化规则。我们发现，在满足所有国家的通常独立定价条件的情况下，企业可能会将利润转移到低税收国家。内部销售和内部债务可以被视为互补的利润转移渠道，也可以被视为替代的利润转移渠道，这取决于所有交易后隐含的隐藏成本如何变化。我们展示了利润转移渠道之间的交叉效应如何通过接受的转移价格和利率促进利润转移。",
