    "translated_abstract": "提示调整（PT）是一种将可训练的少量软提示向量附加到语言模型（LM）输入中的参数高效微调（PEFT）方法，已在各种任务和模型中显示出了有希望的结果。 与其他PEFT方法相比，PT的竞争性能可以在可训练参数更少的情况下保持，并且随着模型规模的扩大，其参数并不会显著增加。 但是，PT引入了额外的软提示标记，导致输入序列变长，这对于Transformer的二次复杂度而言，在训练和推理时间以及内存使用方面会产生显著影响。 这对于面临大量每日查询的大型语言模型（LLMs）尤其令人担忧。",
    "tldr": "DePT通过将软提示分解为较短的软提示和一对低秩矩阵，并用两个不同的学习率来优化，以解决提示调整对训练和推理时间以及内存使用的影响，从而实现更好的性能。",
