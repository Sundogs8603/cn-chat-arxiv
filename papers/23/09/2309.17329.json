    "abstract": "Pulmonary diseases rank prominently among the principal causes of death worldwide. Curing them will require, among other things, a better understanding of the many complex 3D tree-shaped structures within the pulmonary system, such as airways, arteries, and veins. In theory, they can be modeled using high-resolution image stacks. Unfortunately, standard CNN approaches operating on dense voxel grids are prohibitively expensive. To remedy this, we introduce a point-based approach that preserves graph connectivity of tree skeleton and incorporates an implicit surface representation. It delivers SOTA accuracy at a low computational cost and the resulting models have usable surfaces. Due to the scarcity of publicly accessible data, we have also curated an extensive dataset to evaluate our approach and will make it public.",

    "translated_abstract": "肺部疾病在全球范围内是导致死亡的主要原因之一。治愈肺部疾病需要更好地理解肺部系统内的许多复杂的3D树状结构，如气道、动脉和静脉。在理论上，它们可以通过高分辨率图像堆栈进行建模。然而，基于密集体素网格的标准CNN方法代价过高。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种基于点的方法，保留了树骨架的图连通性，并结合了隐式表面表示。它以较低的计算成本提供了SOTA准确度，生成的模型具有可用的表面。由于公开可访问的数据稀缺，我们还整理了一套广泛的数据集来评估我们的方法，并将其公开。",
