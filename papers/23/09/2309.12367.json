    "translated_abstract": "最近大型语言模型（LLM）的进展促进了具有复杂对话能力的聊天机器人的发展。然而，LLM对查询的回答经常不准确，这限制了在教育环境中的应用。本文研究了将知识库（KB）与LLM智能辅导系统集成以增加回答可靠性的效果。为了实现这一目标，我们设计了一个可扩展的知识库，教育监督员可以无缝集成课程，该课程会被智能辅导系统自动处理。然后，我们详细介绍了一个评估实验，学生参与者需要回答有关人工智能课程的问题。 GPT-4智能辅导系统具有不同层次的KB访问权限，并由人类领域专家评估这些回答。最后，学生对智能辅导系统的回答进行了与领域专家的交叉验证，并对它们的各种教学能力进行了排名。",
