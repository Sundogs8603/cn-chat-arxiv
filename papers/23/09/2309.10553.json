    "translated_abstract": "我们研究在线环境中的非线性预测/回归问题，并引入了一种混合模型，通过状态空间形式的联合机制有效地减轻了传统非线性预测模型中特定领域特征工程问题的需求，并实现了非线性和线性组分的有效混合。我们使用递归结构从原始顺序序列中提取特征，并使用传统线性时间序列模型处理序列数据的复杂性，如季节性、趋势等。与现有的集成或混合模型通常以分离的方式训练基础模型不同，这不仅耗时，而且由于建模的分隔或独立训练而非最优。相反，我们首次在文献中采用联合优化的方法，从原始数据中联合优化增强的循环神经网络（LSTM）自动提取特征和ARMA系列时间序列模型（SARIMAX）进行有效建模。",
