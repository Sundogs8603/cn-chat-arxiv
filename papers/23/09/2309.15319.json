    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络(DNNs)的复杂性使其强大，但也使其在解释上具有挑战性，从而限制了其在容忍错误的领域中的应用。现有方法通过识别影响预测结果的特征交互来推断DNNs的内部机制。然而，这些方法通常缺乏一种有系统的策略来优先考虑交互作用并控制置信水平，使其难以在科学发现和假设验证中实际应用。本文介绍了一种方法，称为DeepROCK，通过使用knockoffs（一种设计成在给定特征集的条件下与响应变量相互独立的虚拟变量）来解决这个限制。结合一种新颖的DNN架构，其中包括一层成对耦合层，DeepROCK可以同时控制虚发现率(FDR)和最大化统计功效。此外，我们还发现了一项挑战。",
