    "translated_abstract": "域自适应（DA）被广泛应用于未注释的超广角（UWF）眼底图像的糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）分级中，可以从已标注的彩色眼底图像中转化已注释的知识。然而，由于巨大的域差异和复杂的真实世界场景，大多数主流DA算法在DR分级性能上远远达不到临床诊断的水平。为了解决这个问题，我们在本文中提出了一种新颖的无源主动域自适应（SFADA）方法。具体而言，我们聚焦于DR分级问题本身，提出以DR连续演变关系的方式生成彩色眼底图像特征，通过局部表示匹配主动选择一些有价值的UWF眼底图像进行标注，并利用DR病变原型在UWF眼底图像上适应模型。值得注意的是，SFADA还考虑了数据隐私和计算效率。大量的实验结果表明，我们提出的SFADA方法取得了最先进的DR分级性能。",
