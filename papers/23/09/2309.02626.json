    "translated_abstract": "我们研究基于网络的分散优化问题，在这种问题中，网络中的每个节点都拥有一个本地函数，目标是协同获得一个最小化所有本地函数之和的共识解决方案。分散优化的一个主要挑战是依赖通信，在许多应用中仍然是一个相当大的瓶颈。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种自适应的随机化通信效率算法框架，通过定期追踪不一致误差并精选每个节点中最有影响力和有效的边缘来减少通信量。在这个框架内，我们提出了两种算法：自适应共识（AC）解决共识问题和基于自适应共识的梯度跟踪（AC-GT）解决平滑强凸分散优化问题。我们对所提算法建立了强大的理论收敛保证，并量化了收敛速度和通信成本的界限。",
