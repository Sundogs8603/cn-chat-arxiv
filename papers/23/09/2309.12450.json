    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了受未观察到的混淆因素影响的离线上下文强化学习中的策略评估问题。传统的敏感性分析方法常被用来在给定的不确定性集合上估计在最坏混淆情况下的策略价值。然而，现有的工作通常为了可行性而采用一些粗糙的松弛不确定性集合的方法，导致对策略价值的估计过于保守。在本文中，我们提出了一种通用估计器，利用凸规划提供了策略价值的一个较为精确的下界。我们的估计器的广泛适用性使得其能够进行多种扩展，例如基于f-分歧的敏感性分析、基于交叉验证和信息准则的模型选择以及利用上界进行鲁棒策略学习等。此外，我们的估计方法可以通过强对偶性重新表述为经验风险最小化问题，从而利用M技术提供了对所提出估计器的强理论保证。",
