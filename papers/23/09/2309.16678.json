    "title": "Water Markets as a Coping Mechanism for Climate-Induced Water Changes on the Canadian Economy: A Computable General Equilibrium Approach. (arXiv:2309.16678v1 [econ.GN])",
    "abstract": "Water markets represent a policy tool that aims at finding efficient water allocations among competing users by promoting reallocations from low-value to high-value uses. In Canada, water markets have been discussed and implemented at the provincial level; however, at the national level a study about the economic benefits of its implementation is still lacking. This paper fills this void by implementing a water market in Canada and examine how water endowment shocks would affect the economy under the assumptions of general equilibrium theory. Our results show a water market would damp the economic loss in case of reductions in water endowment, but it also cuts back on the economic expansion that would follow from an increase on it. These results provide new insights on the subject and will provide a novel look and reinvigorate informed discussions on the use of water markets in Canada as a potential tool to cope with climate-induced water supply changes.",

    "translated_abstract": "水市场是一种政策工具，旨在通过促进从低价值到高价值用途的重新分配，找到竞争用户之间的高效水分配方式。在加拿大，水市场已在省级讨论和实施，然而，在国家层面上，关于其实施的经济效益的研究还缺乏。本文通过在加拿大实施水市场，并根据一般均衡理论的假设，考察水赋予冲击对经济的影响来填补这一空白。我们的研究结果表明，在水赋予减少的情况下，水市场能够减缓经济损失，但同时也减少了水赋予增加后可能出现的经济扩张。这些结果为该主题提供了新的见解，并将为关于水市场在加拿大作为应对气候诱导的水供应变化的潜在工具的使用的知情讨论提供新的触发和推动。",
