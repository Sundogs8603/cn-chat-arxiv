    "abstract": "People use web search engines to find information before forming opinions, which can lead to practical decisions with different levels of impact. The cognitive effort of search can leave opinionated users vulnerable to cognitive biases, e.g., the confirmation bias. In this paper, we investigate whether stance labels and their explanations can help users consume more diverse search results. We automatically classify and label search results on three topics (i.e., intellectual property rights, school uniforms, and atheism) as against, neutral, and in favor, and generate explanations for these labels. In a user study (N =203), we then investigate whether search result stance bias (balanced vs biased) and the level of explanation (plain text, label only, label and explanation) influence the diversity of search results clicked. We find that stance labels and explanations lead to a more diverse search result consumption. However, we do not find evidence for systematic opinion change among us",

    "translated_abstract": "人们在形成观点之前使用网络搜索引擎找到信息，这可能导致具有不同影响水平的实际决策。搜索的认知努力可能使有观点的用户容易受到认知偏见的影响，例如确认偏见。在本文中，我们调查立场标签及其解释是否可以帮助用户消费更多不同的搜索结果。我们自动对三个主题（知识产权、校服和无神论）的搜索结果进行分类和标记，分为反对、中立和支持，并为这些标签生成解释。在一项用户研究中（N =203），我们调查了搜索结果立场偏见（平衡 vs 偏见）和解释水平（纯文本、仅标签、标签和解释）是否会影响被点击的搜索结果的多样性。我们发现立场标签和解释可以导致更多样化的搜索结果消费。然而，我们并没有发现系统性观点改变的证据。",
