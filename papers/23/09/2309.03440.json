    "translated_abstract": "准确地分割点状白质病变（PWMLs）对相关发育障碍的及时诊断和治疗至关重要。考虑到病变通常较小、对比度较低，并且病变数量在不同受试者之间可能发生巨大变化，从婴儿脑MR图像中自动分割PWMLs具有挑战性。现有的基于学习的方法直接将通用的网络结构应用于这一具有挑战性的任务，可能无法捕捉到PWMLs的详细位置信息，从而导致严重的欠分割。在本文中，我们提出利用反事实推理的思想结合脑组织分割的辅助任务，学习精细的位置和形态表示以实现PWMLs的准确定位和分割。因此，我们设计了一个简单易行的深度学习框架（即DeepPWML）。它将病变反事实图与组织概率结合起来进行分割。",
