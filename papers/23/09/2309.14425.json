    "abstract": "A general-purpose service robot (GPSR), which can execute diverse tasks in various environments, requires a system with high generalizability and adaptability to tasks and environments. In this paper, we first developed a top-level GPSR system for worldwide competition (RoboCup@Home 2023) based on multiple foundation models. This system is both generalizable to variations and adaptive by prompting each model. Then, by analyzing the performance of the developed system, we found three types of failure in more realistic GPSR application settings: insufficient information, incorrect plan generation, and plan execution failure. We then propose the self-recovery prompting pipeline, which explores the necessary information and modifies its prompts to recover from failure. We experimentally confirm that the system with the self-recovery mechanism can accomplish tasks by resolving various failure cases.

    "translated_abstract": "通用服务机器人（GPSR）能够在各种环境中执行多种任务，需要一个具有高通用性和适应性的系统来应对不同的任务和环境。本文首先基于多个基础模型开发了一个顶层GPSR系统，用于全球竞赛（RoboCup@Home 2023）。该系统既可以适应多种变化，又可以通过提示每个模型来实现自适应。然后，通过分析所开发系统的性能，我们发现在更加现实的GPSR应用设置中存在三种失败类型：信息不足、错误的计划生成和计划执行失败。我们提出了自恢复提示管道，该管道探索必要的信息，并修改其提示来从失败中恢复。我们通过实验证实，具有自恢复机制的系统可以通过解决各种失败案例来完成任务。供补充的视频可在https://sites.google.com/view/srgpsr上找到。",
