    "abstract": "Accurate representation of tooth position is extremely important in treatment. 3D dental image segmentation is a widely used method, however labelled 3D dental datasets are a scarce resource, leading to the problem of small samples that this task faces in many cases. To this end, we address this problem with a pretrained SAM and propose a novel 3D-U-SAM network for 3D dental image segmentation. Specifically, in order to solve the problem of using 2D pre-trained weights on 3D datasets, we adopted a convolution approximation method; in order to retain more details, we designed skip connections to fuse features at all levels with reference to U-Net. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in ablation experiments, comparison experiments, and sample size experiments.",

    "translated_abstract": "牙齿位置的准确表示在治疗中非常重要。3D牙齿图像分割是一种广泛使用的方法，然而标注的3D牙齿数据集是稀缺的资源，这导致了这个任务在许多情况下面临小样本问题。为了解决这个问题，本文采用了预训练的SAM，并提出了一种新颖的3D-U-SAM网络用于3D牙齿图像分割。具体而言，为了解决在3D数据集上使用2D预训练权重的问题，我们采用了卷积逼近方法；为了保留更多细节，我们设计了跳跃连接，以参考U-Net在所有层级上融合特征。通过消融实验、对比实验和样本大小实验证明了所提出方法的有效性。",
