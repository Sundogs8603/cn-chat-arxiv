We addressed several important research questions in this context, including designing a knowledge graph (KG) for clinical trial data, effectiveness of various KG embedding (KGE) methods for it, a novel inductive inference using KGE, and its use in generating recommendations for clinical trial design. We used publicly available data from clinicaltrials.gov for the study. Results show that our recommendations approach achieves relevance scores of 70%-83%, measured as the text similarity to actual clinical trial elements, and the most relevant recommendation can be found near the top of list.

    "translated_abstract": "设计新的临床试验涉及到诸多决策，比如确定队列和设定研究目标等，因此可以通过对过去临床试验记录的全面挖掘来获得推荐建议。本文提出了一种基于临床试验知识图的神经嵌入训练的推荐方法。我们在这个背景下解决了一些重要的研究问题，包括设计临床试验知识图，各种知识图嵌入方法的有效性，使用嵌入进行归纳推理的新方法，以及在临床试验设计中生成推荐的应用。我们使用了来自clinicaltrials.gov的公开数据进行研究。结果显示，我们的推荐方法实现了70％-83％的相关性得分，以实际临床试验元素的文本相似性衡量，而最相关的推荐可以在列表的前部找到。我们的研究还建议了其他方法的改进方向。",
