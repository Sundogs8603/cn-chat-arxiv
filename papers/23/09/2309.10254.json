    "translated_abstract": "近期，如ChatGPT等大型语言模型（LLM）平台开始提供插件生态系统，以与互联网上的第三方服务进行交互。虽然这些插件扩展了LLM平台的功能，但它们是由任意的第三方开发的，因此不能隐式信任。插件还使用自然语言与LLM平台和用户进行交互，这可能导致模糊的解释。本文提出了一个框架，为LLM平台设计者分析和改进当前和未来与插件集成的LLM平台的安全性、隐私和安全性奠定了基础。我们的框架是一个攻击分类法的表述，通过迭代地探索LLM平台相关方如何利用他们的能力和责任对彼此进行攻击来开发的。作为我们迭代过程的一部分，我们将我们的框架应用于OpenAI的插件生态系统。我们揭示了一些具体证明了潜在问题的插件。",
