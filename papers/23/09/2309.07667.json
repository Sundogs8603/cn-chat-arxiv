    "translated_abstract": "每个业务年度的投资利润和损失（p＆l）被分解为不同的风险因素（如利率、信用利差、外汇汇率等）是一项监管要求的任务，例如 Solvency 2。目前有三种常见的分解原则：一次一个（OAT）、顺序更新（SU）和平均顺序更新（ASU）分解。SU和ASU分解完全解释了p＆l。然而，OAT分解会产生一些无法解释的p＆l。SU分解取决于风险因素的顺序或标签。这三种分解可以使用年度、季度、月度或日常数据在不同的子区间定义。在本研究中，我们经验性地量化了OAT分解的无法解释的p＆l，SU分解对更新顺序的依赖以及三种分解原则在子区间大小上的依赖程度。",

    "en_tdlr": "This empirical study investigates three decomposition principles in profit and loss allocation, finding that one-at-a-time decomposition generates unexplained losses, while sequential updating and average sequential updating can fully explain profit and loss, with the order of updating being a factor. Additionally, the results of the decomposition principles are influenced by the size of the sub-intervals."
