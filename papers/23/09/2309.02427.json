    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究在大规模语言模型（LLMs）中增加了外部资源（例如互联网）或内部控制流（例如提示链），用于需要基于语境或推理的任务，从而产生了一类新的语言代理。尽管这些代理取得了实证成功，但我们缺乏一个系统的框架来组织现有代理并规划未来的发展。在本文中，我们借鉴了认知科学和符号人工智能的丰富历史，提出了语言代理的认知架构（CoALA）。CoALA描述了一个具有模块化记忆组件、用于与内部记忆和外部环境交互的结构化行动空间以及选择行动的通用决策过程的语言代理。我们使用CoALA对最近的大量研究进行了回顾和组织，并展望了更强大代理的可行方向。总的来说，CoALA将当今的语言代理置于上下文中。",
