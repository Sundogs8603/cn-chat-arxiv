    "translated_abstract": "无偏学习排名(Unbiased Learning to Rank, ULTR)在从有偏点击日志训练无偏排名模型的现代系统中被广泛应用。关键在于明确地建模用户行为的生成过程，并基于检验假设对点击数据进行拟合。先前的研究经验性地发现只要点击完全拟合，大多数情况下可以恢复出真实潜在相关性。然而，我们证明并非总是能够实现这一点，从而导致排名性能显著降低。在本工作中，我们旨在回答真实相关性是否能够从点击数据恢复出来的问题，这是ULTR领域的一个基本问题。我们首先将一个排名模型定义为可识别的，如果它可以恢复出真实相关性，最多只有一个缩放变换，这对于成对排名目标来说已足够。然后，我们探讨了一个等价的可识别条件，可以新颖地表达为一个图连通性测试问题：当且仅当一个图（即可识别性图）连通时，该排名模型是可识别的。",
