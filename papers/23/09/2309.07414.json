    "translated_abstract": "对于大型语言模型来说，提示非常重要，因为它们提供了主题或逻辑关系等上下文信息。受此启发，我们提出了PromptASR，这是一个将提示集成到端到端自动语音识别（E2E ASR）系统中，以实现具有可控风格的语境化语音转录的框架。具体地，专用文本编码器对文本提示进行编码，并通过跨两种模态的特征交互将编码注入到语音编码器中。当使用前面话语的真实文本作为内容提示时，与基线ASR系统相比，所提出的系统在阅读图书数据集和内部数据集上分别实现了21.9％和6.8％的相对词错误率降低。系统还可以采用单词级偏置列表作为提示，以提高对罕见单词的识别准确性。还可以给文本编码器提供额外的样式提示，并引导ASR系统输出不同风格的转录。代码可供使用。",
