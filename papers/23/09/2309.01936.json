    "abstract": "This paper investigates an optimal investment problem under the tail Value at Risk (tail VaR, also known as expected shortfall, conditional VaR, average VaR) and portfolio insurance constraints confronted by a defined-contribution pension member. The member's aim is to maximize the expected utility from the terminal wealth exceeding the minimum guarantee by investing his wealth in a cash bond, an inflation-linked bond and a stock. Due to the presence of the tail VaR constraint, the problem cannot be tackled by standard control tools. We apply the Lagrange method along with quantile optimization techniques to solve the problem. Through delicate analysis, the optimal investment output in closed-form and optimal investment strategy are derived. A numerical analysis is also provided to show how the constraints impact the optimal investment output and strategy.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在已定义利益养老金会员面临尾 VaR（尾部风险价值，也称为预期损失、条件 VaR、平均 VaR）和投资组合保险约束下的最优投资问题。该会员旨在通过将其财富投资于现金债券、通胀联动债券和股票，使其财富终值超过最低保证，并最大化期望效用。由于存在尾 VaR 约束，无法使用标准控制工具解决问题。我们采用拉格朗日乘子法和分位数优化技术来解决问题。通过精细的分析，我们得出了闭式形式的最优投资结果和最优投资策略。还提供了数值分析，以展示约束如何影响最优投资结果和策略。",
