    "translated_abstract": "符号回归是人工智能科学中最重要的任务之一，它从实验数据中发现控制方程。基于遗传编程、蒙特卡洛树搜索或深度强化学习的流行方法可以从固定数据集中学习符号回归。尤其是在学习涉及多个变量的复杂方程时，它们需要海量的数据集和长时间的训练。最近，引入了控制变量遗传编程（CVGP），它通过从设计的控制变量实验中发现方程来加速回归过程。但是，在CVGP中实验集是先验固定的，我们观察到实验计划的次优选择会显著延迟发现过程。为了克服这个限制，我们提出了竞速控制变量遗传编程（Racing-CVGP），它同时进行多个实验计划。类似于选择好的符号方程的选择方案被用于选择实验计划。",
