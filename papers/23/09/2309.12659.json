    "translated_abstract": "在线更新时间序列预测模型旨在通过基于流数据的高效更新预测模型来解决概念漂移问题。许多算法被设计用于在线时间序列预测，其中一些利用交叉变量依赖性，而其他算法则假设变量之间相互独立。鉴于每个数据假设在在线时间序列建模中都有其优缺点，我们提出了OneNet（在线集成网络）。它动态更新并结合两个模型，一个模型专注于建模时间维度上的依赖关系，另一个模型专注于跨变量的依赖关系。我们的方法将基于强化学习的方法融入传统的在线凸规划框架中，允许线性组合这两个模型，并动态调整权重。OneNet解决了经典在线学习方法在适应概念漂移方面过于缓慢的主要缺点。实证结果表明，OneNet在各种数据集上显著优于其他现有方法。",
