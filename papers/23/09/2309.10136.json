    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）在图数据上展现出强大的表示能力。然而，GNNs容易受到对抗攻击的影响，即使对图结构进行微小扰动也会严重影响它们的性能。现有方法要么对复杂攻击无效，要么需要优化稠密邻接矩阵，这非常耗时且容易陷入局部最优。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种高效的低秩图神经网络（ELR-GNN）防御方法，旨在学习低秩和稀疏的图结构来抵御对抗攻击，保证有效的防御与更高的效率。具体而言，ELR-GNN包括两个模块：粗糙低秩估计模块和细粒度估计模块。第一个模块采用截断奇异值分解（SVD）来初始化低秩邻接矩阵的估计，这作为优化低秩邻接矩阵的起点。",
