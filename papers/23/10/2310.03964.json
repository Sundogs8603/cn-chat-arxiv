    "abstract": "To understand the biological characteristics of neurological disorders with functional connectivity (FC), recent studies have widely utilized deep learning-based models to identify the disease and conducted post-hoc analyses via explainable models to discover disease-related biomarkers. Most existing frameworks consist of three stages, namely, feature selection, feature extraction for classification, and analysis, where each stage is implemented separately. However, if the results at each stage lack reliability, it can cause misdiagnosis and incorrect analysis in afterward stages. In this study, we propose a novel unified framework that systemically integrates diagnoses (i.e., feature selection and feature extraction) and explanations. Notably, we devised an adaptive attention network as a feature selection approach to identify individual-specific disease-related connections. We also propose a functional network relational encoder that summarizes the global topological properties of FC",

    "translated_abstract": "为了理解功能连接性(FC)与神经障碍的生物特征，最近的研究广泛利用基于深度学习的模型来识别疾病，并通过可解释的模型进行事后分析以发现与疾病相关的生物标志物。大多数现有的框架由三个阶段组成，即特征选择、分类的特征提取和分析，每个阶段都是分别实施的。然而，如果每个阶段的结果缺乏可靠性，可能会导致误诊和后续阶段的错误分析。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新的统一框架，系统地集成了诊断(即特征选择和特征提取)和解释。值得注意的是，我们设计了一种自适应注意力网络作为特征选择方法，以识别个体特定的与疾病相关的连接。我们还提出了一个功能网络关系编码器，总结了FC的全局拓扑特性。",
