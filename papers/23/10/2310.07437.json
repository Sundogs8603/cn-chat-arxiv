    "abstract": "A deep learning platform has been developed to forecast the occurrence of the low visibility events or hazes. It is trained by using multi-decadal daily regional maps of various meteorological and hydrological variables as input features and surface visibility observations as the targets. To better preserve the characteristic spatial information of different input features for training, two branched architectures have recently been developed for the case of Paris hazes. These new architectures have improved the performance of the network, producing reasonable scores in both validation and a blind forecasting evaluation using the data of 2021 and 2022 that have not been used in the training and validation.",

    "translated_abstract": "开发了一个深度学习平台，用于预测低能见度事件或雾霾的发生。它通过使用多年期的各种气象和水文变量的区域日常图作为输入特征，并将地面能见度观测作为目标来进行训练。为了更好地保留不同输入特征的特征空间信息进行训练，最近开发了两种针对巴黎雾霾的分支架构。这些新架构提高了网络的性能，在验证和盲预测评估中产生了合理的分数，使用了2021年和2022年的数据，这些数据没有在训练和验证中使用。",
