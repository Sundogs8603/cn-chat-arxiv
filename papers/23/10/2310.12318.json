    "abstract": "We conduct an inquiry into the sociotechnical aspects of sentiment analysis (SA) by critically examining 189 peer-reviewed papers on their applications, models, and datasets. Our investigation stems from the recognition that SA has become an integral component of diverse sociotechnical systems, exerting influence on both social and technical users. By delving into sociological and technological literature on sentiment, we unveil distinct conceptualizations of this term in domains such as finance, government, and medicine. Our study exposes a lack of explicit definitions and frameworks for characterizing sentiment, resulting in potential challenges and biases. To tackle this issue, we propose an ethics sheet encompassing critical inquiries to guide practitioners in ensuring equitable utilization of SA. Our findings underscore the significance of adopting an interdisciplinary approach to defining sentiment in SA and offer a pragmatic solution for its implementation.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们通过批判性地研究189篇同行评审的论文，对情感分析（SA）的应用、模型和数据集进行了调查，以探究情感分析的社会技术方面。我们的研究来源于对情感分析在不同社会技术系统中成为重要组成部分的认识，并对社会学和技术文献中的情感概念进行了深入研究。我们的研究揭示了金融、政府和医疗等领域对情感的不同概念化。我们的研究还发现在情感的定义和框架方面存在明确不足，可能导致挑战和偏见。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一个涵盖关键问题的伦理表格，以指导从业者确保情感分析的公平利用。我们的研究强调了采用跨学科方法来定义情感分析的重要性，并提供了一个实用的解决方案来实施情感分析。",
