    "translated_abstract": "替代建模和活跃子空间已经成为计算科学和工程领域的强大范例。将这些技术应用于社会科学中的计算模型，突显了它们在处理离散输出的Agent-Based模型等不连续模拟器时的局限性。然而，之前的应用研究已经表明，对于这类估计器，替代计算的活跃子空间可以产生有趣的结果。但是，由于活跃子空间是通过梯度定义的，当将该方法应用于不连续模拟器时，估计的是什么量还不清楚。本文首先展示了进行此类分析时可能出现的一些病态情况。这促使我们将活跃子空间扩展到不连续函数上，澄清了在此类分析中实际估计的内容。我们还对合成测试函数进行了数值实验，比较了活跃子空间的高斯过程估计。",
