    "translated_abstract": "基于内容的时间序列检索(CTSR)系统是一个信息检索系统，用户可以与来自多个领域(如金融、医疗和制造业)的时间序列进行交互。例如，用户想要了解时间序列的来源，可以将时间序列作为查询提交给CTSR系统，并检索与之相关的时间序列列表及相关元数据。通过分析检索到的元数据，用户可以获得有关时间序列来源的更多信息。由于CTSR系统需要处理来自不同领域的时间序列数据，因此需要一个高容量模型来有效地度量不同时间序列之间的相似度。此外，CTSR系统内的模型还需要以高效的方式计算相似度得分，以满足用户在实时交互中的需求。本文提出了一种有效且高效的CTSR模型，其性能优于其他替代模型，同时仍然提供合理的准确性。",
