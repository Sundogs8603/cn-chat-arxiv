Unfortunately, most multi-agent benchmarks are either zero-sum or purely cooperative, providing limited opportunities for such measurements. We introduce a general-sum variant of the zero-sum board game Diplomacy -- called Welfare Diplomacy -- in which players must balance investing in military conquest and domestic welfare. We argue that Welfare Diplomacy facilitates both a clearer assessment of and stronger training incentives for cooperative capabilities. Our contributions are: (1) proposing the Welfare Diplomacy rules and implementing them via an open-source Diplomacy engine; (2) constructing baseline agents using zero-shot prompted language models; and (3) conducting experiments where we find that baselines using state-of-the-art models attain high social welfare but are exploitable.

    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能系统的能力不断增长和广泛部署，对于衡量它们合作能力的强大基准是必要的。遗憾的是，大多数多智能体基准要么是零和游戏，要么是纯粹合作的，给予了非常有限的机会进行这种测量。我们引入了零和游戏Diplomacy的一个通用和变种——福利外交，在其中玩家必须平衡军事征服和国内福利的投资。我们认为福利外交可以更清晰地评估并提供更强大的合作能力的培训激励。我们的贡献有：（1）提出福利外交的规则并通过开源Diplomacy引擎实现它们；（2）使用零样本指导的语言模型构建基准智能体；以及（3）进行实验，发现使用最先进模型的基准智能体可以达到很高的社会福利，但是存在被利用的问题。我们的工作旨在通过人工智能的福利外交促进社会的安全。",
