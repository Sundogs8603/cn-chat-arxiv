    "translated_abstract": "生存分析，或时间事件分析，在医疗研究中是一个重要且广泛存在的问题。医疗研究传统上依赖于Cox模型进行生存分析，因为其简单且可解释性强。Cox模型假设一个对数线性风险函数以及时间上的比例风险，当这些假设失败时可能表现不佳。基于机器学习的新型生存模型避免了这些假设，并提供了更高的准确性，但有时以模型的可解释性为代价，而这对于临床使用至关重要。我们提出了一种新颖的生存分析流程，既可解释性强，又能与最先进的生存模型竞争。具体来说，我们使用改进的生存堆叠技术将生存分析问题转化为一个分类问题，使用ControlBurn进行特征选择，并使用可解释的增强机器生成可解释的预测。为了评估我们的流程，我们预测心衰的风险。",
