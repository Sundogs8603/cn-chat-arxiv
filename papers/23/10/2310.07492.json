    "abstract": "Existing black-box attacks have demonstrated promising potential in creating adversarial examples (AE) to deceive deep learning models. Most of these attacks need to handle a vast optimization space and require a large number of queries, hence exhibiting limited practical impacts in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel black-box attack strategy, Conditional Diffusion Model Attack (CDMA), to improve the query efficiency of generating AEs under query-limited situations. The key insight of CDMA is to formulate the task of AE synthesis as a distribution transformation problem, i.e., benign examples and their corresponding AEs can be regarded as coming from two distinctive distributions and can transform from each other with a particular converter. Unlike the conventional \\textit{query-and-optimization} approach, we generate eligible AEs with direct conditional transform using the aforementioned data converter, which can significantly reduce the number of queries needed.

    "translated_abstract": "现有的黑盒攻击已经展现出在欺骗深度学习模型中创建对抗样本（AE）方面的潜力。其中大部分攻击需要处理庞大的优化空间并需要大量的查询，因此在实际情况下具有限制的实际影响。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的黑盒攻击策略，条件扩散模型攻击（CDMA），以提高在查询受限情况下生成AE的查询效率。CDMA的关键洞察是将AE合成的任务形式化为分布转换问题，即良性示例及其对应的AE可以被视为来自两个不同的分布，并且可以通过特定的转换器相互转换。与传统的“查询和优化”方法不同，我们使用上述数据转换器直接进行条件转换来生成符合要求的AE，这可以显著减少所需的查询数量。",
