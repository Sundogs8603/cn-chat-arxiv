    "translated_abstract": "测试时适应（TTA）旨在将最初在训练数据上训练的模型适应于测试数据中的可能分布变化。然而，大多数现有的TTA研究都集中在分类任务上，对于语义分割的TTA探索非常有限。这种对分类的突出重视可能导致许多新手和工程师错误地认为为分类设计的经典TTA方法可以直接应用于分割任务。然而，这一假设仍未经验证，是一个待解决的问题。为了解决这个问题，我们进行了一项系统的实证研究，揭示了分割TTA的独特挑战，并确定经典TTA策略是否可以有效应对这一任务。我们全面的结果得出了三个关键观察结果。首先，常用于分类TTA的经典批归一化更新策略只能带来轻微的性能改善，在某些情况下甚至会对结果产生逆向影响。",
