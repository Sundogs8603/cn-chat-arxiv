    "translated_abstract": "我们在四个或更少复杂射影空间的乘积中构造了所有可能的完全交叉Calabi-Yau五折面，并带有最多四个约束。我们得到了27068个空间，它们相互之间没有行和列排序的关联，并确定了它们的欧拉数。在所有空间中排除3909个产品流形后，我们计算了12433个案例的同调数据，即非产品空间的53.7％，得到了2375个不同的霍奇钻石。包含上述所有信息的数据集可在https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/z7ii5idt6qxu36e0b8azq/h?rlkey=0qfhx3tykytduobpld510gsfy&dl=0获得。讨论了不变量的分布，并与低维类比进行了比较。通过分类器和回归器（全连接和卷积）神经网络对同调数据进行了监督式机器学习。我们发现$h^{1,1}$可以非常高效地学习。",
