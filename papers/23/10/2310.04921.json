We propose a novel method to develop an introspective commonsense reasoner, Crystal. To tackle commonsense problems, it first introspects for knowledge statements related to the given question, and subsequently makes an informed prediction that is grounded in the previously introspected knowledge.

    "translated_abstract": "大量工作表明，通过知识增强的推理方法可以提高常识推理的性能和可解释性，其中推理过程的基础知识明确表达和利用。然而，现有的实现，包括\"思维链\"及其变种，未能捕捉到常识推理中所需的内省性质，也未能解释知识生成和利用之间的相互适应。我们提出了一种新颖的方法来开发内省型常识推理器 Crystal。为了解决常识问题，它首先内省与给定问题相关的知识陈述，然后基于先前内省的知识进行知情预测。模型的知识内省和基于知识的推理模式通过强化学习进行调整，其中奖励来自反馈。",
