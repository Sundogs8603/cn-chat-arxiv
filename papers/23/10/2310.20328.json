    "translated_abstract": "在这篇资源论文中，我们发布了一个新的语料库ChiSCor，其中包含了619个奇幻故事，由442名年龄在4-12岁的荷兰儿童自由讲述。ChiSCor被编译用于研究儿童如何展示人物的观点，以及揭示语言和认知在发展中的作用，利用计算工具。与现有资源不同，ChiSCor的故事是在自然环境中产生的，符合最近对更生态有效数据集的呼吁。ChiSCor提供了文本、音频和人物复杂性和语言复杂性的注释。还为三分之一的荷兰儿童提供了附加元数据（如监护人的教育背景）。ChiSCor还包括一小部分62个英文故事。本文详细介绍了ChiSCor的编制方式，并展示了它在未来工作中的潜力，通过三个简短的案例研究：i）我们展示故事的句法复杂度在儿童的年龄之间非常稳定；ii）我们扩展了关于自由言论中Zipfian分布的工作，并展示了ChiSCor服从Zipf定律。",
