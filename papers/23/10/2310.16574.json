    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种映射算法，使用近似的高斯过程（GP）回归计算室内环境中的大规模磁场地图。映射环境中环境磁场的空间变化可以用于室内定位算法。为了计算这样的地图，GP回归是一种适合的工具，因为它提供了在新位置的磁场预测以及不确定性量化。由于全GP回归的复杂度随着数据点的数量呈立方增长，因此对于GP的近似方法已被广泛研究。在本文中，我们在结构化核插值（SKI）框架上构建，通过利用高效的Krylov子空间方法加速推断。具体而言，我们将带导数的SKI（D-SKI）纳入了用于磁场建模的标量势模型，并使用线性数据点复杂度计算预测均值和协方差。在我们的模拟中，我们展示了我们的方法。",
