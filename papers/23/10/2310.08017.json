Using three empathy-related metrics, we compared their responses to those from traditional response generation dialogue systems, which were fine-tuned on the ED dataset, along with human-generat",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种信息获取和推理任务中表现出色。这些计算系统驱动着最先进的对话系统，如ChatGPT和Bard。它们在满足心理健康护理增长需求方面也具有巨大的潜力，尽管相对未被探索。因此，本研究旨在研究LLMs在模拟心理健康咨询环境中生成共情回应的能力。我们选择了五个LLMs：Generative Pre-training（GPT）的3.5版和4版、Vicuna FastChat-T5、Pathways Language Model（PaLM）的2版和Falcon-7B-Instruct。根据一个简单的指令提示，这些模型对来自EmpatheticDialogues（ED）数据集的话语进行回应。使用三个与共情相关的度量指标，我们将其回应与在ED数据集上进行微调的传统回应生成对话系统以及由人类生成的回应进行了比较。",
