    "translated_abstract": "专业术语抽取是文本分析中的重要任务。当语料库中一个术语的出现集中在少数几个文件中时，可称之为“爆发性”。作为内容丰富的术语，爆发性术语非常适合用于主题描述，并且是技术术语的自然候选词。文献中提出了多种术语爆发性的测量方法。然而，在文本分析中，包括与术语爆发性相关的统计显著性测试范式尚未得到充分探索。为了探索这个领域，我们的主要贡献是提出了一种基于多项式语言模型的术语爆发性统计显著性的精确测试方法。由于计算成本过高，我们还提出了一个启发式公式，用于近似测试P值。作为补充的理论贡献，我们推导了一种未经报道的逆文档频率与逆收集频率的关系。",
