    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了在树度量空间上支持的概率测度的优化传输（OT）问题。已知这种OT问题（即树-瓦瓦斯坦（TW））具有闭合形式表达式，但基本上取决于输入测度支持上的底层树结构。然而，在实际操作中，由于噪声或对抗性测量，给定的树结构可能会被扰动。为了缓解这个问题，我们采取了最大-最小鲁棒OT方法，该方法考虑了在一个树度量的不确定性集合上两个输入测度之间的最大可能距离。总体上说，由于其非凸性和非光滑性，这种方法很难计算，即便是在支持为1维空间的测度情况下，这妨碍了它的实际应用，特别是在大规模情景下。在本文中，我们从边缘删除/添加的角度提出了一种新颖的树度量的不确定性集合，这个集合在一个优雅的框架下涵盖了多样的树结构。",
