    "abstract": "Daily electricity consumption forecasting is a classical problem. Existing forecasting algorithms tend to have decreased accuracy on special dates like holidays. This study decomposes the daily electricity consumption series into three components: trend, seasonal, and residual, and constructs a two-stage prediction method using piecewise linear regression as a filter and Dilated Causal CNN as a predictor. The specific steps involve setting breakpoints on the time axis and fitting the piecewise linear regression model with one-hot encoded information such as month, weekday, and holidays. For the challenging prediction of the Spring Festival, distance is introduced as a variable using a third-degree polynomial form in the model. The residual sequence obtained in the previous step is modeled using Dilated Causal CNN, and the final prediction of daily electricity consumption is the sum of the two-stage predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves higher accuracy ",

    "translated_abstract": "日电力消耗预测是一个经典问题。现有的预测算法在特殊日期如节假日上容易准确性下降。本研究将日电力消耗序列分解为趋势、季节性和残差三个组成部分，并采用分段线性回归作为过滤器和空洞因果卷积神经网络作为预测器构建了一个两阶段预测方法。具体步骤包括在时间轴上设置断点，使用月份、工作日和节假日的独热编码信息拟合分段线性回归模型。针对春节的挑战性预测，引入了距离作为变量，采用三次多项式形式纳入模型。前一步得到的残差序列使用空洞因果卷积神经网络进行建模，最终的日电力消耗预测是两阶段预测的总和。实验结果证明，该方法实现了更高的准确性。",
