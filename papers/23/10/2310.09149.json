    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在Wasserstein空间$W_p(\\mathbb{R}^d)$中通过离散和分段常数测度来对测度进行结构逼近。我们证明，如果一个满秩的格点$\\Lambda$按照$h\\in(0,1]$的比例进行缩放，那么基于$h\\Lambda$的Voronoi分割得到的测度逼近是$O(h)$，不论$d$或$p$的取值。之后，我们使用覆盖论证证明，对于紧支撑的测度的$N$项逼近是$O(N^{-\\frac1d})$，这与最优量化器和经验测度逼近在大多数情况下已知的速率相匹配。最后，我们将这些结果推广到非紧支撑测度，要求其具有足够的衰减性质。",
    "tldr": "本论文研究了在Wasserstein空间中通过离散和分段常数测度进行的结构逼近方法。结果表明，对于满秩的格点按比例缩放后得到的Voronoi分割逼近的测度误差是$O(h)$，逼近的$N$项误差为$O(N^{-\\frac1d})$，并且可以推广到非紧支撑测度。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates structured approximation methods for measures in the Wasserstein space using discrete and piecewise constant measures. The results show that the approximation error of a measure based on a Voronoi partition of a scaled lattice is $O(h)$, and the $N$-term approximation error for compactly supported measures is $O(N^{-\\frac1d})$, which extends to non-compactly supported measures with sufficient decay."
