The data is used to study the trajectories of change in individuals' religious beliefs, values, and behaviors in societies. Utilizing random forest, we aim to identify the key factors of religiosity and classify respondents of the survey as religious and non religious using country level data. We use resampling techniques to balance the data and improve imbalanced learning performance metrics. The results of the variable importance analysis suggest that Age and Income are the most important variables in the majority of countries. The results are discussed with fundamental sociological theories regarding religion and human behavior. This study is an application of machine learning in identifying the underlying patterns in the data of 30 countries participating in the World Value Survey. The results from variable importance analysis and classification of imbalanced data provide valuable insigh",

    "translated_abstract": "本文是对世界价值观调查全球数据的定量分析研究。利用随机森林，我们旨在识别宗教性的关键因素，并使用国家级数据将调查中的受访者分为宗教和非宗教。我们使用重采样技术平衡数据，并提高不平衡学习性能指标。变量重要性分析的结果表明，在大多数国家中，年龄和收入是最重要的变量。通过与宗教和人类行为的基本社会学理论相结合，讨论了结果。这项研究是机器学习在参与世界价值观调查的30个国家的数据中识别潜在模式的应用。",
