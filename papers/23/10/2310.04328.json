    "translated_abstract": "用于进行离散决策的优化模型通常包含基于预测估计的上下文相关且不确定的参数。为了考虑基于预测的决策质量，决策导向学习（端到端预测-优化）旨在训练预测模型以最小化遗憾，即通过进行次优决策而产生的损失。尽管这个损失函数可能是非凸和一般不可导的，但已经提出了有效的基于梯度的学习方法来最小化期望损失，使用经验损失作为替代。然而，经验遗憾可能不是一个有效的替代，因为优化模型中的不确定性导致经验遗憾与期望遗憾在期望上不相等。为了说明这种不等式的影响，我们评估了机会性和认知性不确定性对经验遗憾作为替代的准确性的影响。接下来，我们提出了一种改进的损失函数，该函数能够更好地近似期望遗憾，从而更好地指导决策导向学习的训练过程。",
