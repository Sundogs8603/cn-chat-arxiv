    "abstract": "This paper aims to shed light on the evolutionary dynamics of diverse and social populations by introducing the rich expressiveness of generative models into the trait expression of social agent-based evolutionary models. Specifically, we focus on the evolution of personality traits in the context of a game-theoretic relationship as a situation in which inter-individual interests exert strong selection pressures. We construct an agent model in which linguistic descriptions of personality traits related to cooperative behavior are used as genes. The deterministic strategies extracted from Large Language Model (LLM) that make behavioral decisions based on these personality traits are used as behavioral traits. The population is evolved according to selection based on average payoff and mutation of genes by asking LLM to slightly modify the parent gene toward cooperative or selfish. Through preliminary experiments and analyses, we clarify that such a model can indeed exhibit the evolution",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在通过将生成模型的丰富表达性引入到社会基于智能体的进化模型中，探讨多样性和社会群体的进化动态。具体来说，我们关注在博弈理论关系的背景下个性特征的演化，这是一个相互利益施加强烈选择压力的情况。我们构建了一个智能体模型，其中合作行为相关个性特征的语言描述被用作基因，从大规模语言模型（LLM）中提取的确定性策略根据这些个性特征做出行为决策被用作行为特征。根据平均收益的选择和通过请求LLM对父基因进行略微修改实现基因的突变，我们使群体进化。通过初步实验和分析，我们阐明了这样的模型确实可以展示演化的特征。",
