    "abstract": "To understand the goals and goal representations of AI systems, we carefully study a pretrained reinforcement learning policy that solves mazes by navigating to a range of target squares. We find this network pursues multiple context-dependent goals, and we further identify circuits within the network that correspond to one of these goals. In particular, we identified eleven channels that track the location of the goal. By modifying these channels, either with hand-designed interventions or by combining forward passes, we can partially control the policy. We show that this network contains redundant, distributed, and retargetable goal representations, shedding light on the nature of goal-direction in trained policy networks.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了了解人工智能系统的目标和目标表示，我们仔细研究了一个预训练的强化学习策略网络，该网络通过导航到一系列目标方块来解决迷宫问题。我们发现这个网络追求多个上下文相关的目标，并且我们进一步确定了网络中与其中一个目标对应的电路。特别是，我们确定了11个跟踪目标位置的通道。通过修改这些通道，不论是通过手工设计的干预还是通过组合前向传递，我们都可以部分地控制策略。我们展示了这个网络包含多余的、分布式的、可重新定向的目标表示，为训练策略网络中目标导向的本质提供了揭示。",

By modifying specific channels, the policy can be partially controlled. This suggests the existence of redundant, distributed, and retargetable goal representations in trained policy networks."
