    "translated_abstract": "精细运动技能，尤其是书写等技能，在学术和日常生活中起着重要作用。传统的教学方法虽然有效，但耗时且不一致。随着机器人和人工智能等先进技术的兴起，越来越多的人开始关注利用这些技术自动化教学过程，通过人机和人机交互。本研究探讨了虚拟人工智能教师在模仿人类教育者技术方面对于运动技能习得的潜力。我们引入了一种捕捉到人类教师独特特征的人工智能教师模型。通过使用适应于模仿教师-学习者交互的强化学习环境测试我们的人工智能模型，我们验证了四个指导性假设，强调学习者表现的提升、技能习得速度的增强以及学习结果的变异性的减少。我们的研究发现在合成学习者上进行了验证。",
