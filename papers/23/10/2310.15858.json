    "translated_abstract": "在推荐系统中，基于图的协同过滤方法通过引入图对比学习来缓解数据稀疏性。然而，这些基于图对比学习的协同过滤模型中的随机负采样策略忽视了用户（物品）的语义结构，这不仅引入了错误的负样本（与锚定用户（物品）相似的负样本），还忽略了潜在的正样本。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了面向推荐的拓扑感知去偏向自监督图学习（TDSGL），根据用户（物品）之间的语义相似性构建对比对。具体而言，由于原始的用户-物品交互数据很好地反映了用户的购买意图和物品的某些特征，我们在交互数据上计算用户（物品）之间的语义相似性。然后，给定一个用户（物品），我们通过选择嵌入不同语义结构的用户（物品）来构建其负样本对，以确保去偏向性。",
