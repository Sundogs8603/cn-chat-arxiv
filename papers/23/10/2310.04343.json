    "translated_abstract": "蛋白质是几乎所有生物体中负责基本功能的大分子。设计合理的具有期望功能的蛋白质至关重要。蛋白质的序列和结构密切相关，它们共同决定了其功能。在本文中，我们提出了NAEPro，一种基于自动检测到的功能位点共同设计蛋白质序列和结构的模型。NAEPro采用了注意力和等变层的交错网络，可以捕捉序列中的全局相关性以及三维空间中最近氨基酸的局部影响。这种架构在两个层面上促进了有效而经济的信息传递。我们在两个蛋白质数据集（β-内酰胺酶和肌红蛋白）上评估了我们的模型和几个强竞争基线。实验结果表明，我们的模型在所有竞争对手中始终实现了最高的氨基酸恢复率、TM分数和最低的RMSD。这些发现证明了该模型的能力。",
