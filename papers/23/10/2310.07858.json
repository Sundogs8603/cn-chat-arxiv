    "translated_abstract": "当前的量子计算时代产生了几种算法，承诺高计算效率。虽然这些算法在理论上是可行的，并且可以提供潜在的指数级加速，但关于如何设计合适的量子电路来实现适当的幺正变换应用于输入的量子态却没有太多指导。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于人工智能的量子架构搜索软件包\\texttt{QArchSearch}，其使用\\texttt{QTensor}库作为后端，为给定任务和输入的量子态寻找最佳模型提供了一个有原则的自动化方法。我们展示了该搜索软件包能够将搜索有效扩展到大型量子电路，并且能够探索不同量子应用的更复杂模型。\\texttt{QArchSearch}在高性能计算系统上通过CPU和GPU的两级并行化方案以规模和高效率运行，这已经在Polari上得到了证明。",
