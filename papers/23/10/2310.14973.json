    "translated_abstract": "永续掉期是一种衍生合约，允许交易者就加密货币的价格变动进行投机或对冲。与传统意义上的期货合约不同，永续掉期没有结算或到期日。资金费率作为一种机制，通过套利者的帮助将永续掉期与其基础资产联系起来。在永续掉期和衍生合约的背景下，持仓量指的是在特定时间点的未平仓合约的总数。作为衍生品市场的关键指标，持仓量可以提供市场活动、情绪和整体流动性的见解。它还提供了一种估计交易所上每个加密货币市场所需担保的下限的方式。通过在交易所上所有市场上累积这个数字，并结合储备证明，可以判断所讨论的交易所是否采用不可持续的杠杆水平运营，这可能会带来偿付能力的影响。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出一种方法，通过调和持仓量和交易量来解决永续掉期中的问题。持仓量是衍生品市场中的关键指标，它提供了市场活动、情绪和整体流动性的见解。研究还发现，通过估计担保的下限，可以评估交易所的杠杆水平是否可持续运营。"
