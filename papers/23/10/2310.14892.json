    "translated_abstract": "可控的文本生成（CTG）旨在生成具有所需属性的文本，而基于解码时间的方法在这个任务上已经显示出了有希望的性能。然而，在本文中，我们首次发现了属性坍缩现象。当控制强度超过临界值时，它会导致生成文本的流畅性迅速降低，使文本完全无法使用。这个限制阻碍了解码方法在实现高水平可控性方面的有效性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的轻量级解码框架，名为空气解码。它的主要思想是通过重建属性分布来平衡属性词和非属性词之间的权重，从而生成更流畅的文本。具体而言，我们通过前缀微调来训练前缀以获得属性分布。然后，我们设计了一种新颖的属性分布重建方法来平衡所获得的分布，并使用重建后的分布进行解码。",
