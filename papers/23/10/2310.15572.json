    "translated_abstract": "构建和分析知识图谱（KG）以辅助药物发现是研究的一个热门领域。KG的一个显著特点是其能够以有利于发现关联的格式，结合许多异构数据源。KG的实用性已在药物重新作用等领域得到体现，通过对数据进行手动探索和建模来获得洞见。本文讨论了使用自然语言处理（NLP）从科学文献等非结构化文本中挖掘数据作为KG数据源的优势与陷阱。这是基于我们最初解析结构化数据源（如ChEMBL）作为KG数据的基础，并借助NLP进行丰富或扩展的经验。NLP对KG的基本优势在于自动提取来自数百万文档的数据，这是仅通过人工策展无法实现的任务。然而，在NLP-KG流程中存在许多潜在陷阱，如错误的命名实体。",
