    "translated_abstract": "近来，大语言模型(如ChatGPT)在法律领域引起了很大的关注，因为其突出的能力能够处理各种法律任务。然而，目前还不清楚LLMs是否能够像律师那样分析法律案例并进行推理。因此，我们构建了一个新颖的语料库，包含马来西亚合同法和澳大利亚社会法关于被赡养儿童的情景。我们使用IRAC方法将ChatGPT应用于对语料库进行分析，IRAC方法是法律专业人士广泛使用的组织法律分析的框架。语料库中的每个情景都以半结构化格式注释了完整的IRAC分析，以便机器和法律专业人士能够解释和理解这些注释。此外，我们进行了第一次对ChatGPT进行IRAC分析的实证评估，以了解其与法律专业人士分析的吻合程度。",
