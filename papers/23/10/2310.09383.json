    "translated_abstract": "设计生成需要将神经和符号推理紧密结合，因为良好的设计必须满足显式用户需求和隐含的美学、实用性和便利性规则。当前由神经网络驱动的自动化设计工具能够生成吸引人的设计，但不能满足用户的规格和实用要求。符号推理工具（如约束编程）不能感知图像中的低级视觉信息或捕捉到美学等微妙方面。我们引入了Spatial Reasoning Integrated Generator (SPRING)用于设计生成。SPRING在深度生成网络中嵌入了一个神经和符号整合的空间推理模块。空间推理模块通过一个循环神经网络预测并通过符号约束满足来决定要生成的对象的位置，以边界框的形式表示。将符号推理嵌入神经生成保证了SPRING的输出满足用户的规格和实用要求。",
