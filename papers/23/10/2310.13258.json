    "translated_abstract": "紧密合作的人机操纵依赖准确的人体运动预测。尽管在大规模学习预测模型方面取得了显著进展，但当应用于操作任务时，这些模型在关键转折点处积累了较高的误差，导致下游规划性能的降低。我们的关键见解是，与其预测最有可能的人体运动，产生能够捕捉未来人体运动如何影响机器人计划成本的预测就足够了。我们提出了ManiCast，一种新颖的框架，学习成本感知的人体预测并将其提供给模型预测控制规划器以执行协同操作任务。我们的框架实现了人类和7个自由度的机械臂在如反应搅拌、物体交接和协同摆桌等多个真实任务中的流畅、实时交互。我们对运动预测和端到端的预测-规划系统进行了评估",
