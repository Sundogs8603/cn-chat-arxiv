    "translated_abstract": "最近，机器学习领域已经从以模型为中心转向以数据为中心。对各种学习任务的进展是由于更广泛的数据集的积累所推动的，随之而来的是在这些数据集上训练更大模型的可能性。然而，这些数据集仍然相对未被充分探索。为此，我们引入了一种开创性的方法，称为RK-core，以帮助更深入地了解数据集内复杂的层次结构。在多个基准数据集上，我们发现具有较低核心值的样本在其相应类别中的代表性较低，相反，具有较高核心值的样本表现出更大的代表性。相应地，具有较高核心值的样本相对于具有较低核心值的样本对性能贡献更大。基于此，我们进一步利用RK-core分析具有不同coreness值的样本的层次结构。",
