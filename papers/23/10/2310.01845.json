    "translated_abstract": "基础模型在各种任务中表现出色，但通常在常规基准测试中评估。将这些模型应用于特定领域，如遥感图像，仍然是一个未充分开发的领域。在遥感领域中，精确的建筑物实例分割对于城市规划等应用至关重要。虽然卷积神经网络（CNN）表现良好，但它们的泛化能力可能受限。为了实现这一目标，我们提出了一种新的方法，以使基础模型适应已有模型的泛化性能下降。在众多模型中，我们的重点在于Segment Anything Model（SAM），这是一种强大的基础模型，以其擅长无类别图像分割能力而闻名。我们首先确定了SAM的局限性，揭示了它在应用于遥感图像时性能不佳。此外，SAM不具备识别能力，因此无法对定位的对象进行分类和标记。为了解决这些限制，我们引入了不同的提示",
