    "translated_abstract": "近年来，对于文本到SQL翻译的兴趣日益增长，这是将自然语言问题转化为可执行SQL查询的任务。这项技术具有潜在的潜力，可以使数据库中的数据提取民主化。然而，其中一些主要障碍包括领域泛化，即适应以前未见到的数据库，并且将自然语言问题与相应的SQL查询对齐。为了克服这些挑战，我们引入了SQLformer，这是一种针对执行文本到SQL翻译任务而设计的新型Transformer体系结构。我们的模型以自回归的方式预测SQL查询，并在编码器和解码器层中结合结构归纳偏差。这种偏差是由数据库表和列选择引导的，有助于解码器以广度优先搜索的规范顺序生成SQL查询的图形表示。全面的实验说明了现阶段的技术水平",
