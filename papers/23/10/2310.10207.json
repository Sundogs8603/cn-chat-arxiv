    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了Bongard-OpenWorld，这是一个用于评估机器视觉中真实世界少样本推理的新基准。 它源自经典的Bongard问题（BPs）：给定两组图像（正和负），模型需要通过诱导视觉概念来确定查询图像所属的图像集，这些概念仅由正集中的图像所描述。 我们的基准继承了原始BPs的少样本概念归纳，同时增加了两层新挑战：1）开放世界的自由形式概念，因为Bongard-OpenWorld中的视觉概念是从开放词汇表中独特组合的术语，范围从对象类别到抽象视觉属性和常识事实知识； 2）真实世界的图像，而不是许多类似物使用的合成图表。在我们的探索中，Bongard-OpenWorld已经对当前的少样本推理算法提出了重大挑战。我们还远",
