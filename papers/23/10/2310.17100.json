    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）的研究已经产生了一些策略，使用训练过的GNN的梯度来修改图的边，以实现网络设计的目标。然而，控制基于梯度的编辑的因素还没有得到充分研究，这导致选择边缘的原因以及编辑是否基于边缘的重要性变得模糊。因此，我们首先分析了先前作品中的梯度计算，阐明了影响编辑的因素，并突出了对结构属性过度依赖的潜在问题。具体来说，我们发现边缘可以实现高梯度，原因是结构偏差，而不是重要性，导致当这些因素与设计任务无关时出现错误的编辑。为了改进编辑，我们提出了ORE，一种迭代编辑方法，（a）编辑最高评分的边缘，（b）重新嵌入编辑后的图以刷新梯度，从而减少偏好性较高的边缘选择。我们通过一组拟议的设计任务对ORE进行了实证研究，每个任务都有一个外部验证方法，证明ORE可以改善编辑的性能。",
