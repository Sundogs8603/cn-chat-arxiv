    "abstract": "Nowadays neural-network-based image- and video-quality metrics show better performance compared to traditional methods.

However, the adversarial robustness of image-quality metrics is also an area worth researching. In this paper, we analyse modern metrics' robustness to different adversarial attacks. We adopted adversarial attacks from computer vision tasks and compared attacks' efficiency against 15 no-reference image/video-quality metrics. Some metrics showed high resistance to adversarial attacks which makes their usage in benchmarks safer than vulnerable metrics.

    "translated_abstract": "如今，基于神经网络的图像和视频质量评估度量方法相比传统方法表现更好。然而，它们也变得更容易受到对抗性攻击，这些攻击可以提高度量分数但不改善视觉质量。现有的质量度量基准将其性能与主观质量相关性和计算时间进行比较。然而，图像质量度量的对抗鲁棒性也是一个值得研究的领域。本文分析了现代度量方法对不同对抗攻击的鲁棒性。我们采用了计算机视觉任务中的对抗攻击，并比较了这些攻击对15个无参考图像/视频质量度量方法的效果。一些度量方法对对抗攻击表现出了较高的抵抗力，使它们在基准测试中的使用比容易受攻击的方法更安全。该基准测试接受研究人员提交新的度量方法，以使他们的方法对攻击更加鲁棒，或者为他们寻找符合需求的鲁棒度量方法。",
