    "translated_abstract": "使用下一个标记预测来训练大型transformer在AI领域取得了突破性进展。尽管这种生成型AI方法取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但它严重依赖于人类监督。即使是像ChatGPT这样的最先进的AI模型也依赖于通过人类演示的微调，需要大量的人类输入和领域专业知识。对人类监督的强烈依赖对于推动AI创新构成了重大障碍。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一种新的范式，称为探索性AI（EAI），旨在自主生成高质量的训练数据。从无监督强化学习（RL）的预训练中获得灵感，EAI在自然语言空间内实现了探索。我们通过利用大型语言模型评估生成内容的新颖性来实现这一目标。我们的方法包括两个关键组成部分：一个生成按照探索原则生成新颖内容的执行者和一个评估生成内容的评论家。",
