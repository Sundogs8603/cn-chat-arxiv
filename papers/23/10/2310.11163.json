    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了IMTLab，这是一个开源的端到端交互式机器翻译（IMT）系统平台，使研究人员能够快速构建具有最先进模型的IMT系统，进行端到端评估，并诊断系统的弱点。IMTLab将整个交互翻译过程视为任务导向的对话，并在其中引入人机交互，以产生高质量、无错误的翻译。为此，我们设计了一个通用的通信接口，以支持灵活的IMT架构和用户策略。基于所提出的设计，我们构建了一个模拟和真实的交互环境，实现了端到端评估，并利用该框架系统地评估了之前的IMT系统。我们的模拟和手动实验表明，在端到端评估中，前缀约束解码方法仍然具有最低的编辑成本，而BiTIIMT达到了可比的编辑成本。",
