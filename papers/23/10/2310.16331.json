    "translated_abstract": "最近对储层计算研究的先进进展促使人们需要具有可促进储层物理实现的动力学的模拟设备，以实现更快的信息处理速度，同时消耗较少能量和占用更小的面积。研究表明，具有非线性和短期记忆动力学的动态记忆电阻器，是用于时间分类和预测任务的信息处理设备或储层的理想选择。以往的实现依赖于名义上相同的记忆电阻器对输入数据应用相同的非线性变换，这不足以实现丰富的状态空间。为了解决这个限制，研究人员要么在多个记忆电阻器之间扩展数据编码，要么利用记忆电阻器之间的随机设备变异性。然而，这种方法需要额外的预处理步骤，并且会导致同步问题。因此，最好的解决方案是对输入数据进行编码，使得记忆电阻器的动力学能够自适应地调整。",
