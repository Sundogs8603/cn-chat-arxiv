    "translated_abstract": "惯用语在日常语言中很常见，但对于翻译人员来说常常是一个挑战，因为它们的意义不是由它们的部分的意义推导出来的。尽管取得了重大进展，机器翻译系统仍然难以翻译惯用表达。我们提供了惯用翻译和相关问题的简单描述。这使我们能够进行一个综合实验，揭示了基于transformer的机器翻译模型在正确地默认采用惯用翻译时的临界点。为了扩大多语资源，我们编制了一个包含法语、芬兰语和日语中包含惯用表达的大约4k个自然句子的数据集。为了改进对自然惯用语的翻译，我们引入了两种简单但有效的技术：在可能具有惯用性的句子上策略性地加权训练损失，并使用检索增强模型。这不仅使强大的预训练机器翻译模型在惯用句子上的准确性提高了最多13%，还改进了翻译的准确性。",
