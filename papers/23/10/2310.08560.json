    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）已经改变了人工智能领域，但受限于有限的上下文窗口，使其在延长对话和文档分析等任务中的效用有所限制。为了能够利用超出有限上下文窗口的上下文，我们提出了虚拟上下文管理技术，该技术借鉴了传统操作系统中的分层内存系统，通过在快速和慢速存储器之间移动数据来提供大内存资源的外观。借助这种技术，我们引入了MemGPT（Memory-GPT），一种智能地管理不同内存层级的系统，以在LLM的有限上下文窗口内提供扩展上下文，并利用中断来管理自身与用户之间的控制流。我们在两个领域评估了我们受操作系统启发的设计，这些领域中现代LLM的有限上下文窗口严重影响了它们的性能：文档分析，其中MemGPT能够分析超出底层限制的大型文档。",
