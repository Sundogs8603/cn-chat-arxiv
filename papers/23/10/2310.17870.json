    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了带有槽约束的排名问题，这可以用来建模各种应用问题 - 从具有不同专业限制槽位的大学录取，到在医学试验中构建符合条件的参与者分层队列。我们发现，传统的概率排名原则（PRP）在带有槽约束的排名问题中可能会非常次优，因此我们提出了一种新的排名算法，称为MatchRank。MatchRank的目标是在候选人按排名顺序由人类决策者进行评估时，产生最大化填充槽位的排名。这样，MatchRank在广义上是PRP的推广，当没有槽约束时，它是PRP的特例。我们的理论分析表明，MatchRank具有强大的逼近保证，没有任何槽位或候选人之间的独立性假设。此外，我们展示了如何高效地实现MatchRank。除了理论保证外，我们还展示了MatchRank的实验结果在不同应用领域的有效性。",
