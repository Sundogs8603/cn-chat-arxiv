    "translated_abstract": "心电图(ECG)是监测人类心脏活动的重要信号。研究人员利用深度学习模型在临床应用中取得了有希望的结果。然而，主流的深度学习方法通常忽视了ECG心跳波形的周期性和形态属性。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于ECG-Segment的学习(ECG-SL)框架，以明确地建模ECG信号的周期性。具体来说，ECG信号首先被划分为心跳片段，然后从每个片段中提取结构特征。基于这些结构特征，设计了一个时间模型来学习不同临床任务的时间信息。此外，由于存在大量的ECG信号但标记数据非常有限，我们还探索了自监督学习策略来预训练模型，从而显著提高了下游任务的性能。所提出的方法优于其他方法。",
