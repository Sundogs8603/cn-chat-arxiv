    "translated_abstract": "在Feinstein和Rudloff（2023）中，他们证明了对于任意非合作$N$人博弈，纳什均衡解集合与具有非凸顺序锥的某个向量优化问题的帕累托最优点集合是一致的。为了避免处理非凸顺序锥，我们证明了将纳什均衡解集合等价地表示为$N$个多目标问题（即具有自然顺序锥）的帕累托最优点的交集。目前，计算多目标问题的精确帕累托最优点集合的算法仅适用于线性问题的类别，这将导致这些算法只能用于解线性博弈的真实纳什均衡集合的可能性降低。本文中，我们将考虑更大类别的凸博弈。由于通常只能为凸向量优化问题计算近似解，我们首先展示了类似于上述结果的结果，即$\\epsilon$-近似纳什均衡解集合与问题完全相似。",
