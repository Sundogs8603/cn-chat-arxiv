    "abstract": "The interactive use of large language models (LLMs) in AI assistants (at work, home, etc.) introduces a new set of inference-time privacy risks: LLMs are fed different types of information from multiple sources in their inputs and are expected to reason about what to share in their outputs, for what purpose and with whom, within a given context. In this work, we draw attention to the highly critical yet overlooked notion of contextual privacy by proposing ConfAIde, a benchmark designed to identify critical weaknesses in the privacy reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our experiments show that even the most capable models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT reveal private information in contexts that humans would not, 39% and 57% of the time, respectively. This leakage persists even when we employ privacy-inducing prompts or chain-of-thought reasoning. Our work underscores the immediate need to explore novel inference-time privacy-preserving approaches, based on reasoning and theory",

    "translated_abstract": "在AI助手（工作、家庭等）中交互使用大型语言模型（LLMs）引入了一系列新的推理时隐私风险：LLMs从多个来源的输入中获取不同类型的信息，并期望在给定的上下文中推理出在何种目的和与谁分享的内容。在这项工作中，我们通过提出ConfAIde，一个旨在识别指令调整的LLMs隐私推理能力中重要弱点的基准，来引起人们对上下文隐私这一极其关键但经常被忽视的概念的关注。我们的实验表明，即使是GPT-4和ChatGPT等最强大的模型，在人类不会的上下文中，也会泄露39％和57％的私人信息。即使我们使用保护隐私的提示或思维链推理，这种泄漏也会持续存在。我们的工作强调了迫切需要探索基于推理和理论的新型推理时隐私保护方法。",
