    "translated_abstract": "许多顺序决策任务需要满足多个部分矛盾的目标。现有方法是整体化的，即通过一个函数来选择一系列动作来满足所有目标。我们提出了基于拍卖的调度，这是一个模块化的多目标决策框架。每个目标都使用单独的策略来实现，这些策略可以独立创建、修改和替换。可以理解的是，具有冲突目标的不同策略可能在给定时间选择冲突的动作。为了解决冲突和组合策略，我们采用了一种新颖的基于拍卖的机制。我们给每个策略分配一个有限的预算，在每一步，策略同时从可用的预算中出价来获取调度和选择动作的特权。策略使用其出价来表达调度的紧迫性，有限的预算确保了长期的调度公平性。",

The innovation of this framework lies in assigning the fulfillment of each objective to separate policies that can be independently created, modified, and replaced. The use of an auction mechanism resolves conflicts and composes policies, ensuring long-term scheduling fairness."
