    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一个一般的离散选择模型，将同伴影响纳入偏好和考虑集中。我们对平衡行为进行描述，并建立了一系列选择中能恢复模型各个部分的条件。我们允许同伴影响只作用于偏好、只作用于考虑，或者同时作用于两者。我们利用不同类型的变化来区分偏好和考虑集中的同伴影响。这使我们能够恢复网络中代理之间的连接集合（和类型）。然后我们利用这些信息来恢复每个代理人的随机偏好和注意机制。这些非参数识别结果允许代理人之间的无限异质性，并不依赖于协变量或可用选项（或菜单）的变化。我们将我们的结果应用于咖啡连锁店的扩张决策，并发现有限的考虑证据。我们进行了反事实预测模拟，并展示了有限的考虑如何影响决策。",
