    "translated_abstract": "由于专业人员的严重匮乏和可获得性限制，精神疾病仍然是我们这个时代最重要的公共卫生问题之一。心理疗法需要高水平的专门知识，以对患者的认知建模进行深度、复杂的推理和分析。在大型语言模型的时代，我们认为现在是开发计算心理疗法的人工智能辅助的合适时机。我们研究了认知失真检测的任务，并提出了思维诱导诊断（DoT）。DoT通过三个阶段对患者的言语进行诊断：主观性评估以区分事实和思维；对比推理以引出支持和反驳思维的推理过程；模式分析以总结认知模式。通过这三个阶段生成的诊断解释对辅助专业人员非常重要。实验结果显示，DoT在认知失真方面的效果明显优于ChatGPT。",
