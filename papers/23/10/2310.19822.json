State-of-the-art ML-based weather forecast models, such as FuXi, have demonstrated superior statistical forecast performance in comparison to the high-resolution forecasts (HRES) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）模型在天气预报方面取得了显著的进展，FuXi等最先进的基于ML的天气预报模型展示了优越的统计预报性能。然而，ML模型面临一个共同的挑战：随着预报时间的增加，它们往往会生成越来越平滑的预测结果，导致对极端天气事件的强度低估。为了解决这个挑战，我们开发了FuXi-Extreme模型，该模型使用去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）来恢复由FuXi模型在5天预报中生成的表面预报数据中的更细节尺度的细节。对极端降水（$\\textrm{TP}$）、10米风速（$\\textrm{WS10}$）和2米温度（$\\textrm{T2M}$）的评估说明了其优越的性能。",
