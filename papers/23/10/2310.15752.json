    "translated_abstract": "在翻译与说话者相关的词语时，语音翻译系统应该避免使用默认的男性泛用词，也不应依赖可能具有误导性的声音特征。相反，它们应该根据说话者的偏好来确定性别。现有的解决方案虽然有效，但在实践中很难实现，因为它们涉及对带有性别标签的语音翻译数据进行专门的模型重新训练。为了克服这些局限性，我们提出了第一个能够推断控制与说话者相关的性别变化的解决方案。我们的方法部分替换了语音翻译解码器隐含学习的（有偏见的）内部语言模型（LM），使用了特定性别的外部LM。通过对en->es/fr/it的实验结果表明，我们的解决方案在性别准确性方面优于基准模型和最佳训练时间缓解策略，对女性形式的提高分别达到了31.0和1.6个百分点。在具有挑战性的条件中，说话者的声音特征引发了性别冲突，这些增益甚至更大（分别为32.0和3.4）。",
