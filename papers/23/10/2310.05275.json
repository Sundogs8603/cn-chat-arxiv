    "translated_abstract": "私人捐助者为支持2020年选举的行政工作向地方选举官员捐赠了超过3.5亿美元。支持者辩称这些资助是中立的，是在疫情期间维持正常选举工作所必需的，而批评者担心这些资助主要流向了民主党的票仓，并影响了选举结果。出于这些担忧，24个州限制了私人选举资助。这些资助在2020年总统选举中起到了多大的作用？为了回答这个问题，我们收集了私人选举行政资助和选举结果的行政数据。然后，我们利用合成控制方法的新进展，比较了收到资助的县与2020年之前平均总统选举结果和投票率完全相同的县的总统选举结果和投票率。虽然民主党倾向的县更有可能申请资助，但我们发现这些资助并没有对总统选举结果产生明显影响。",
