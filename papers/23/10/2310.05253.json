    "translated_abstract": "主张验证在打击虚假信息方面起着至关重要的作用。尽管现有的主张验证工作取得了令人满意的结果，但仍有一个关键问题尚未解决，那就是如何在不依赖于昂贵的人工标注数据的情况下进行主张验证。此外，模型提供全面解释以证明其决策并协助人工事实检查员也非常重要。本文提出了一种能够使用大型语言模型进行复杂主张验证和生成解释的一阶逻辑指导的知识基础的推理方法（FOLK）。FOLK利用大型语言模型的上下文学习能力将主张转化为一阶逻辑子句，并生成一组谓词，每个谓词对应一个需要验证的子主张。然后，FOLK通过一组基于知识的问答对进行一阶逻辑指导的推理，从而进行真实性验证。",
