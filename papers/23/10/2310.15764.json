    "translated_abstract": "最近关于半监督学习（SSL）的研究取得了很大的成功。尽管现有的最新方法在性能上很有前景，但它们往往倾向于通过引入更多的网络组件和额外的训练过程来获得越来越复杂的设计。在本文中，我们提出了一种简单的方法，名为集成投影器辅助半监督学习（EPASS），主要关注于改进学习的嵌入以提高现有对比联合训练半监督学习框架的性能。与标准方法不同，EPASS将多个投影器的集合嵌入存储在存储器中，以供对比学习时使用。结果，EPASS改善了泛化能力，加强了特征表示，并提高了性能。例如，EPASS将半监督学习的强基线的top-1错误率提高了39.47\\%/31.39\\%/24.70\\%。",
