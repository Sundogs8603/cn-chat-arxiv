    "abstract": "This paper presents MindTheDApp, a toolchain designed specifically for the structural analysis of Ethereum-based Decentralized Applications (DApps), with a distinct focus on a complex network-driven approach. Unlike existing tools, our toolchain combines the power of ANTLR4 and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) traversal techniques to transform the architecture and interactions within smart contracts into a specialized bipartite graph. This enables advanced network analytics to highlight operational efficiencies within the DApp's architecture.  The bipartite graph generated by the proposed tool comprises two sets of nodes: one representing smart contracts, interfaces, and libraries, and the other including functions, events, and modifiers. Edges in the graph connect functions to smart contracts they interact with, offering a granular view of interdependencies and execution flow within the DApp. This network-centric approach allows researchers and practitioners to apply complex network theory ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了MindTheDApp，这是一种专为以太坊基于去中心化应用程序（DApps）的结构分析而设计的工具链，其独特的重点是复杂的网络驱动方法。与现有工具不同，我们的工具链结合了ANTLR4和抽象语法树（AST）遍历技术的能力，将智能合约中的架构和交互转化为专门的二分图。这使得高级网络分析能够突出DApp架构的操作效率。所提出的工具生成的二分图包括两组节点：一组表示智能合约、接口和库，另一组包括函数、事件和修饰符。图中的边将函数与它们交互的智能合约连接起来，提供了DApp中的相互依赖关系和执行流程的细粒度视图。这种以网络为中心的方法允许研究人员和从业者应用复杂的网络理论",
