    "abstract": "Text generation in image-based platforms, particularly for music-related content, requires precise control over text styles and the incorporation of emotional expression. However, existing approaches often need help to control the proportion of external factors in generated text and rely on discrete inputs, lacking continuous control conditions for desired text generation. This study proposes Continuous Parameterization for Controlled Text Generation (CPCTG) to overcome these limitations. Our approach leverages a Language Model (LM) as a style learner, integrating Semantic Cohesion (SC) and Emotional Expression Proportion (EEP) considerations. By enhancing the reward method and manipulating the CPCTG level, our experiments on playlist description and music topic generation tasks demonstrate significant improvements in ROUGE scores, indicating enhanced relevance and coherence in the generated text.",

    "translated_abstract": "在基于图像的平台中生成文本，特别是与音乐相关的内容，需要对文本样式进行精确控制并融入情感表达。然而，现有的方法往往需要控制生成文本中外部因素的比例，并且依赖于离散输入，缺乏对期望文本生成的连续控制条件。本研究提出了一种用于受控文本生成的连续参数化方法（CPCTG）来克服这些限制。我们的方法利用语言模型（LM）作为样式学习器，集成了语义凝聚度（SC）和情感表达比例（EEP）的考虑。通过改进奖励方法和操作CPCTG水平，我们在播放列表描述和音乐主题生成任务上的实验证明了ROUGE分数的显著提高，表明生成的文本在相关性和连贯性上得到了增强。",
