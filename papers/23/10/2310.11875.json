    "abstract": "The paper presents a method for using fractional concepts in a neural network to modify the activation and loss functions. The methodology allows the neural network to define and optimize its activation functions by determining the fractional derivative order of the training process as an additional hyperparameter. This will enable neurons in the network to adjust their activation functions to match input data better and reduce output errors, potentially improving the network's overall performance.",
