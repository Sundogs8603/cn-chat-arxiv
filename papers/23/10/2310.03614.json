    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络（DNN）是推动机器学习最近进展的主要力量。然而，研究表明DNN容易受到对抗样本的攻击，即通过扰动输入样本来迫使基于DNN的模型产生错误。因此，对抗机器学习（AdvML）引起了大量关注，研究人员在不同环境和模态下研究了这些漏洞。此外，发现DNN容易包含内嵌偏见，并且经常产生难以解释的预测结果，这可能导致反社会的人工智能应用。利用大型语言模型（LLM），如ChatGPT和GPT-4等新技术的出现，增加了大规模产生反社会应用的风险。为社会公益而进行的对抗机器学习（AdvML4G）是一个新兴领域，它利用AdvML漏洞来发明有益于社会的应用。监管机构、从业者和研究人员应该合作，推动有益于社会的应用的发展。",
