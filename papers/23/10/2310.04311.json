    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在只有接收方有相关辅助信息的噪声无线信道上进行低延迟图像传输（Wyner-Ziv情景）。我们特别关注通过数据驱动的联合源信道编码（JSCC）方法开发实际方案，这在实际有限块长度的情况下已被证明优于传统的分离式方法，并在信道质量方面提供了优雅的退化。我们提出了一种新的神经网络架构，在接收器端的多个阶段将仅解码器侧信息融入其中。我们的结果表明，所提出的方法成功地整合了辅助信息，在各种畸变准则下，在所有信道噪声水平上都实现了改进的性能，尤其是在低信道信噪比（SNR）和小带宽比（BR）的情况下。我们还提供了所提方法的源代码，以便进一步研究。",
