    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的方法，利用适用于分析多种类型的结果的广义结构方程模型进行因果发现，包括离散、连续和混合数据。因果发现常常面临无法测量的混淆因素的挑战，这阻碍了因果关系的识别。所提出的方法通过开发两种剥离算法（自下而上和自上而下）来确定因果关系和有效的工具变量，解决了这个问题。该方法首先利用基于节点化GLM回归的剥离算法重构超图，表示变量之间的祖先关系，利用主要和仪器变量之间的关系。然后，利用另一个剥离算法从祖先关系中估计父母-子女效应，同时通过从父母的模型借用信息来解决子女模型的混淆问题。本文对所提出的方法进行了理论分析，建立了相关理论保证。",
