    "translated_abstract": "人类具有一种卓越的能力，即将新颖的解释赋予语言表达，使他们能够学习新单词并理解社群特定的内涵。然而，大型语言模型（LLMs）具有知识截断，并且重复微调成本高昂，因此，LLMs在上下文学习中学习新颖解释是至关重要的。在本文中，我们系统分析了LLMs使用上下文学习获取新颖解释的能力。为了促进我们的研究，我们引入了MAGNIFICo，这是一个在文本到SQL语义解析框架内实现的评估套件，它包括多样的令牌和提示设置，以模拟现实世界的复杂性。MAGNIFICo上的实验结果表明，LLMs展现出了一个令人惊讶的强大能力，可以从自然语言描述以及长对话中的讨论中理解新颖解释。然而，我们的发现也凸显出进一步改进的需求，特别是",
