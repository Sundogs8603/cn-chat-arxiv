    "translated_abstract": "利用大型语言模型（LLMs）解决演绎推理问题已经引起了越来越多的关注。在复杂的演绎问题中仍然很难取得令人满意的结果，这类问题具有大量前提（即事实或规则），其中涉及实体之间错综复杂的关系，需要进行多跳推理。一种直观的解决方案是将原始任务分解为较小的子任务，然后以前向（例如选择-推理）或反向（例如LAMBADA）方式将多个因果推理步骤连接在一起。然而，这些技术不可避免地需要大量的总体阶段，导致计算开销大，并且有更高的可能性产生误导性的步骤。除了逐阶段分解之外，我们还从人类问题解决的另一个方面获得了启发。人类倾向于提炼出最相关的信息并有序地组织思维（例如创建思维导图），这有助于他们对问题进行有效的推理。",
