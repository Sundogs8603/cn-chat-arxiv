    "translated_abstract": "数据驱动建模可能面临对数据的不断需求，导致准确性降低，并且数据成本高昂、信息稀缺，对工程应用不实用。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种渐进降阶建模框架，旨在减少对数据的需求并提高数据驱动建模的实用性。我们的方法通过类似于人类选择性使用有价值的知识而忽略无用信息的门控机制，有选择性地从先前训练的模型中传递知识。通过从先前模型中筛选出相关信息，我们可以创建一个具有最小转换时间和较小训练集的代理模型，仍然能够实现高准确性。我们在多个案例中测试了我们的框架，包括多孔介质中的传输、重力驱动流动和超弹材料的有限变形。我们的结果表明，保留先前模型的信息并利用其中的有价值部分可以提高建模的准确性。",
