    "translated_abstract": "已观察到机器学习算法对某些人群产生偏见的预测。为了减轻这种偏见并实现可比的准确性，一种有希望的方法是引入涉及公平性定义的代理函数，并解决一个受限制的优化问题。然而，在以往的研究中，一个有趣的问题是这种公平性代理函数可能导致不公平的结果。在本研究中，为了深入理解这个问题，我们以广泛使用的公平性定义——人口统计平等——为例，从理论和实证上证明了公平性定义和公平性代理函数之间存在一个代理-公平性差距。这个\"差距\"直接决定了一个代理函数是否适合替代一个公平性定义。此外，关于这个\"差距\"的理论分析和实验结果激发了我们的兴趣，表明无限制的代理函数将受到决策边界远离的点的影响。",
