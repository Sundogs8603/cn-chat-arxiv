    "translated_abstract": "在在线学习环境中，保持学习者的积极参与是一个主要的挑战。为增强学习者的参与度，提出了各种不同的教学策略，无论是在线还是离线环境中。概念达成模型就是一种教学策略，它着重于学习者对概念的深入理解，而不仅仅是对概念的字典定义。通过搜索和列举用于区分各种概念的实例和非实例之间的属性，来达到这一目的。我们的工作试图将概念达成模型应用于构建概念谜题，以在在线学习环境中使用。该方法涉及从学习资源中创建事实三元组，根据其对概念的唯一性进行分类为“主题标记”和“共同”，然后根据概念达成模型的格式生成谜题，并捕获这些谜题的所有可能解。从人类评估中获得的结果显示...",
