    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的检测方法，用于在一系列相关的可能为多元的函数值观测中检测变点的存在。我们的方法可以测试一个非常通用的变点类别，包括经典的均值变化以及整个分布的变化。我们的统计量基于经验能量距离的推广；我们提出了能量距离过程的加权泛函，旨在提高检测样本端点处断点的能力。我们的统计量的极大选择版本的极限分布只需要计算协方差函数的特征值，因此可以在最常用的软件包（如R）中方便地实施。我们证明，在替代假设下，我们的统计量能够检测甚至非常靠近样本开头/结尾处的变点。在存在多个变点的情况下...",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new method for detecting changepoints in functional data using the empirical energy distance. The method can test a wide range of changepoint categories, including changes in mean and changes in the entire distribution. The proposed method utilizes weighted functionals of the energy distance process to enhance detection capability at sample endpoints, and can be readily implemented in commonly used software packages."
