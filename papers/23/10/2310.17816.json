    "translated_abstract": "该研究解决了在有限先验知识下自动变量选择的问题。给定一个{X,Y}的曝光-结果对和一个未知因果结构的变量集合Z，局部分区发现（LDP）算法将Z划分成与{X,Y}相关的子集。我们列举了任意Z的8个穷举且互不重复的分区，并利用这个分类法区分混淆因素和其他变量类型。LDP的动机是有效的调整集识别，但避免了自动变量选择方法中常见的预处理假设。我们提供了理论保证，LDP对于满足足够图形条件的任何Z都返回一个有效的调整集。在更强的条件下，我们证明了分区标签的渐近正确性。总独立性测试在|Z|的最坏情况下是二次的，经验上观察到次二次的运行时间。我们在合成数据上对理论保证进行了数值验证。",
