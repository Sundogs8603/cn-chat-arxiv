    "translated_abstract": "城市环境是复杂的系统，关键基础设施的故障可能对社区的经济和社会福祉产生影响。电力系统具有特殊意义，因为它们对其他基础设施至关重要，中断可能引发广泛后果。通常，评估电力供应需要地面数据，而在冲突区域和资源有限的地区可能具有挑战性。本研究展示了如何利用卫星图像、社交媒体和信息提取来监测停电及其感知原因。利用2019年3月的夜间灯光数据（委内瑞拉卡拉卡斯）来指示停电区域。利用Twitter数据来确定情感和主题趋势，同时进行统计分析和主题建模以深入了解公众对停电原因的看法。研究结果显示夜间灯光强度与停电量之间存在反向关系。提到委内瑞拉总统的推文显示出更高的负面情绪和绿色词汇趋势。",
