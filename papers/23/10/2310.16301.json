    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）已经成为自然语言处理领域中具有影响力的工具，然而，它们处理多方对话（MPC）的能力——一个由多个参与者参与复杂信息交流的场景——尚未被探索。在本文中，我们深入研究了ChatGPT和GPT-4等生成型LLM在MPC环境下的潜力。通过对包含五个代表性任务的三个MPC数据集进行评估，进行了一个实证分析，以评估ChatGPT和GPT-4的零样本学习能力。研究结果显示，ChatGPT在一些评估的MPC任务上的表现令人期待，而GPT-4的结果预示着一个有希望的未来。此外，我们通过包括发言人和受话人结构在内的MPC结构，努力提高性能。本研究提供了一种详尽的评估和分析。",
