    "translated_abstract": "随着配备了自适应巡航控制（ACC）和其他自动驾驶功能的先进驾驶辅助系统的出现，针对这些自动驾驶车辆（AVs）的网络攻击潜在风险也出现了。虽然强制车辆发生碰撞的明显攻击容易被识别，但更隐蔽的攻击，只略微改变行驶行为，可能会导致网络范围内拥堵、燃油消耗增加，甚至增加碰撞风险，但很难被检测到。为了解决这种攻击的检测问题，我们首先提出了一个交通模型框架，用于描述可能的三种网络攻击类型：恶意操纵车辆控制命令、对传感器测量数据进行虚假注入攻击和拒绝服务（DoS）攻击。然后，我们研究了这些攻击对个体车辆（微观）和交通流（宏观）水平的影响。我们提出了一种基于生成对抗网络（GAN）的异常检测模型，用于实时识别。",
