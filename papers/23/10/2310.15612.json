    "translated_abstract": "目前，尼科语（一种在多个西非国家使用的语言）没有可用的机器翻译系统，但它在文化和教育价值上具有重要意义。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一套工具、资源和基准结果，旨在开发可用的尼科语和其他当前没有足够大的平行文本语料库的语言的机器翻译系统。具体包括：(1) Friallel：一种新颖的协作平行文本整理软件，通过基于副本编辑的工作流程实现质量控制。(2) 扩展了FLoRes-200和NLLB-Seed语料库，从其他语言中与尼科语平行翻译了2,009和6,193个高质量的文本。(3) nicolingua-0005：包含130,850个平行片段的三语和双语语料库，以及超过3百万尼科语单语言语料库。(4) 基线双语和多语言神经机器翻译结果与b...",
