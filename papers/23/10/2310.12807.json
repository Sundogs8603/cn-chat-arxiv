    "abstract": "The \"Hotelling rule\" (HR) called to be \"the fundamental principle of the economics of exhaustible resources\" has a logical deficiency which was never paid a sufficient attention to. This deficiency should be taken into account before attempting to explain discrepancies between the price prediction provided by the HR and historically observed prices. Our analysis is focused on the HR in its original form, we do not touch upon other aspects such as varying extraction costs and other ways of upgrading the original model underlying the Hotelling rule. We conclude that HR can not be derived from the simple models as it was claimed, therefore it should be understood as an assumption on its own, and not as a rule derived from other more basic assumptions.",

    "translated_abstract": "被称为“枯竭性资源经济的基本原则”的“Hotelling法则”存在着一个从未被充分关注的逻辑缺陷。在试图解释HR提供的价格预测与历史观察到的价格之间的差异之前，应该考虑到这个缺陷。我们的分析集中在HR的原始形式上，我们不涉及其他方面，如不同的开采成本和升级原始模型的其他方式。我们得出结论，HR不能从简单模型中推导出来，因此它应该被理解为自身的假设，而不是从其他更基本的假设中推导出来的规则。",
