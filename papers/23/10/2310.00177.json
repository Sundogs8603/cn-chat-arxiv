    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一个神经预处理的迭代求解器，用于具有混合边界条件的泊松方程。泊松方程在科学计算中是普遍存在的：它控制着广泛的物理现象，在许多数值算法中作为子问题出现，并且作为更广泛的椭圆PDE类的模型问题。最流行的泊松离散化方法可以产生大型稀疏线性系统。在高分辨率和对性能至关重要的应用中，迭代求解器结合强大的预处理器可以提供优势。我们求解器的核心是一个神经网络，该网络经过训练可以近似离散结构网格拉普拉斯算子的逆算子，适用于任意形状的域和混合边界条件。我们展示了该问题的结构激发了一种新颖的网络架构，即使在训练集之外的边界条件下，该架构也表现出高效的预处理器。我们展示了在具有挑战性的测试案例上的效果。",
