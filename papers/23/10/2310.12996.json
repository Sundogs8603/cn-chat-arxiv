    "translated_abstract": "传统的深度学习方法通常使用有监督学习来进行药物反应的预测，这需要依赖于已标记的药物反应数据进行模型训练。然而，在临床药物筛选阶段的实际应用中，需要药物反应模型来预测新化合物的反应，这些化合物的药物反应通常是未知的，这带来了挑战，使得传统的有监督深度学习方法在这种情况下不适用。本文提出了一种在临床药物筛选中用于药物反应预测的无监督学习解决方案。具体而言，我们提出了一种多分支多源领域自适应测试增强插件(MSDA)，MSDA可以与传统的药物反应预测方法无缝集成，从相似药物的先前反应数据中学习不变特征，以增强对未标记化合物的实时预测。我们使用GDSCv2和CellMiner数据集进行实验。结果表明，MSDA能够高效地预测药物反应。",
