    "translated_abstract": "镰状细胞贫血（SCD）是一种慢性遗传性疾病，特征为反复发作的急性疼痛。阿片类药物通常用于管理这些疼痛发作；在这种疾病中使用阿片类药物管理疼痛的程度是一个争议的问题。吸食成瘾的风险和阿片类药物治疗的副作用往往会导致将来更多的疼痛发作。因此，准确预测患者将来的疼痛发展轨迹对于帮助患者管理他们的SCD以提高生活质量而不损害治疗至关重要。由于疼痛主要是由患者自行报告记录的，获得许多疼痛记录来设计预测模型是具有挑战性的。因此，在解决疼痛预测问题时，仅依靠监督学习的方式既昂贵又痛苦（因为需要患者配合）。鉴于这一挑战，我们提出使用自监督学习方法来解决疼痛预测问题。此外，对这种时间序列数据进行聚类对于患者表型研究至关重要。",
