Visual content possesses a unique emotional appeal that often leads to increased user engagement. However, research on visual communication remains relatively limited, particularly in the Global South. This study aims to bridge this gap by employing a combination of computational methods and qualitative approach to investigate the visual communication strategies employed in a dataset of 11,263 Instagram posts by 19 Brazilian presidential candidates in 2018 and 2022 national elections. Through two studies, we observed consistent patterns across these candidates on their use of visual political communication.

    "translated_abstract": "在当今数字时代，图像已经成为政治人士在社交媒体平台上与选民互动的强大工具。视觉内容具有独特的情感吸引力，往往导致用户参与度增加。然而，对视觉传播的研究仍然相对有限，尤其是在全球南方国家。本研究旨在通过采用计算方法和定性方法相结合的方式，研究2018年和2022年19位巴西总统候选人在Instagram上发布的11,263条帖子中采用的视觉传播策略，以弥补这一空白。通过两项研究，我们观察到这些候选人在视觉政治传播上存在一致的模式。值得注意的是，我们确定了庆祝和积极调性图像的普遍性。他们还展示了强烈的个性化感，描绘候选人与选民更紧密相连的形象。",
