    "abstract": "The impact of person-job fit on job satisfaction and performance is widely acknowledged, which highlights the importance of providing workers with next steps at the right time in their career. This task of predicting the next step in a career is known as career path prediction, and has diverse applications such as turnover prevention and internal job mobility. Existing methods to career path prediction rely on large amounts of private career history data to model the interactions between job titles and companies. We propose leveraging the unexplored textual descriptions that are part of work experience sections in resumes. We introduce a structured dataset of 2,164 anonymized career histories, annotated with ESCO occupation labels. Based on this dataset, we present a novel representation learning approach, CareerBERT, specifically designed for work history data. We develop a skill-based model and a text-based model for career path prediction, which achieve 35.24% and 39.61% recall@10 r",

    "translated_abstract": "人-职业匹配对工作满意度和工作绩效的影响被广泛承认，这凸显了在职业生涯中为工作者提供下一步行动的重要性。职业路径预测是预测职业生涯中的下一步行动的任务，并具有员工流失预防和内部岗位流动等多种应用。现有的职业路径预测方法依赖于大量的私人职业历史数据来建模职位和公司之间的交互作用。我们提出利用简历中的工作经历部分的未开发的文本描述。我们介绍了一个由2,164个匿名化职业经历组成的结构化数据集，并带有ESCO职业标签。基于这个数据集，我们提出了一个专门为工作历史数据设计的新颖表示学习方法CareerBERT。我们开发了基于技能和基于文本的模型来进行职业路径预测，在@10下，技能模型和文本模型实现了35.24%和39.61%的召回率。",
