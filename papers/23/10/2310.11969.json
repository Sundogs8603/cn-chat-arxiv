    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于观察性研究的因果推断的简单方法，用于平衡协变量的分布。该方法可以平衡任意数量的分位数（例如中位数、四分位数或十分位数），如果必要的话还可以平衡均值。所提出的方法基于校正估计器的理论（Deville和Sarndal，1992），尤其是Harms和Duchesne（2006）提出的分位数校准估计器。通过修改熵平衡方法和协变量平衡倾向评分方法，可以平衡处理组和对照组的分布。该方法不需要数值积分、核密度估计或对分布的任何假设；可以通过利用现有的渐近理论得到有效的估计。模拟研究的结果表明，该方法可以有效地估计被处理组的平均处理效应（ATT）、平均处理效应（ATE）和处理组的总处理效应（ATE）等。",
