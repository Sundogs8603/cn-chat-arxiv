    "translated_abstract": "传统上，畜牧动物的健康和福利监测是一项人力密集型的任务。最近的进展导致了人工智能和计算机视觉技术的引入，尤其是深度学习模型，作为畜牧业的决策工具。这些模型已被用于动物识别、追踪、身体部位识别和物种分类等任务。过去十年中，人们对使用这些模型来探索畜牧动物行为与健康问题之间的关系越来越感兴趣。尽管先前的综述研究比较通用，但目前还没有一项专门研究畜牧动物行为识别的综述研究。因此，进行了这项系统文献综述(SLR)。SLR通过对电子数据库进行初步搜索，共得到1101篇出版物。经过定义的选择标准筛选后，筛选出126篇出版物。这些出版物基于质量和相关性进行进一步筛选，以最终获得最相关的研究文献。",
    "tldr": "本文通过系统文献综述研究了深度学习在畜牧动物行为识别中的应用，并发现了人工智能和计算机视觉技术在畜牧业中的潜在决策工具的重要作用。",
