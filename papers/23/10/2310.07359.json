    "translated_abstract": "双相情感障碍（BD）是一种通过重复的亢奋和抑郁周期进行诊断的精神疾病。由于诊断BD依赖于长时间内的主观行为评估，基于客观标准的可靠诊断并不直接。本研究通过提出一种混合GAN-CNN模型，从三维结构磁共振图像（sMRI）诊断BD来应对上述障碍。本研究的创新点在于使用sMRI样本而不是传统数据集（如功能性磁共振成像（fMRI），脑电图（EEG）和行为症状）来诊断BD，同时解决了处理sMRI样本时通常遇到的数据不足问题。还通过使用5倍交叉验证来测试不同增强比例的影响。根据结果，本研究获得了75.8％的准确率，60.3％的敏感性和82.5％的特异性，比先前工作高出3-5％，同时使用不到6％的样本数量。",
