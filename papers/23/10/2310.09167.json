    "translated_abstract": "在小分子药物或农药的研发中，重要的一个方面就是它们在静脉和口服给药后的全身可用性。从候选化合物的化学结构预测全身可用性非常有价值，因为它可以让药物或农药的研发集中在具有良好动力学特性的化合物上。然而，这样的预测具有挑战性，因为可用性是分子性质、生物学和生理学之间复杂相互作用的结果，而训练数据非常稀缺。在这项工作中，我们改进了先前开发的混合模型[34]。我们将总的口服暴露的中值折叠误差从2.85降低到2.35，将静脉给药的误差从1.95降低到1.62。这是通过在更大的数据集上进行训练，改进神经网络架构以及机制模型的参数化实现的。此外，我们扩展了我们的方法来预测其他终点和处理不同的协变量。",

By training on a larger dataset and improving the network architecture and parametrization of the mechanistic model, the errors in oral and intravenous administration are reduced, and the method is extended to predict additional endpoints and handle different covariates."
