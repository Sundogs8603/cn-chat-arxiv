    "translated_abstract": "分析作者和文章的写作风格对支持各种文学分析，如作者鉴定和体裁检测至关重要。多年来，包括文体学、词袋模型和n-gram等丰富的特征集被广泛用于进行此类分析。然而，这些特征的有效性很大程度上取决于特定语言的语言特征和数据集的特点。因此，基于这些特征集的技术无法在不同领域获得期望的结果。本文提出了一种基于Word2vec图模型的文档建模方法，可以准确捕捉文档的上下文和风格。通过使用这些基于Word2vec图的特征，我们进行分类从而进行作者鉴定和体裁检测任务。我们通过详细的实验研究对广泛的文学作品进行了验证，结果表明与传统基于特征的方法相比，这种方法更为有效。我们的代码和数据是公开可用的。",
