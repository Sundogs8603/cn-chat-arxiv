    "translated_abstract": "车载群体智能是一个新兴的研究领域。通过先进的车载自组织网络和人工智能的支持，各种车载群体智能应用开始出现，如协作感知、定位和制图。车载群体智能应用的协作性通常需要参与者之间共享数据，从而形成网络范围内的智能。如何在不损害数据隐私的情况下实现这个过程仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。尽管联邦学习是解决这个问题的一种有希望的工具，但将传统的联邦学习框架适应于车载群体智能是非常困难的。首先，由于存在信道条件不利的停滞者，车载群体智能中的集中式模型聚合是不可靠的。其次，现有的联邦学习方案容易受到非独立同分布数据的影响，而车载群体智能中的数据异质性加剧了这一问题。本文提出了一种名为RaftFed的新型联邦学习框架，以促进保护隐私的车载群体智能。实验结果表明，RaftFed在数据隐私保护和性能方面都取得了良好的效果。",
