    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了Cosmos，一个针对组合泛化（CG）设计的以对象为中心的世界建模框架，即在通过已知的视觉“原子”组合获得的未见过的输入场景上具有高性能。Cosmos的核心洞察力是使用一种新颖的神经符号化基础。具体来说，该框架引入了两个新工具：（i）神经符号化场景编码，使用神经编码器计算每个场景中的实体的实向量表示，并使用描述实体属性的可组合符号向量，以及（ii）神经符号化注意机制，将这些实体与学习到的交互规则绑定起来。Cosmos是端到端可微分的；此外，与传统的神经符号化方法需要手动将表示映射为符号不同，它使用视觉-语言基础模型计算实体的符号属性。通过对已建立的blocks场景进行两种不同形式的CG评估，我们验证了Cosmos的有效性。",
