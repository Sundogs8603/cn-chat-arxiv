    "translated_abstract": "准确的行业分类是许多资产管理应用程序的重要工具。尽管当前的行业黄金标准GICS（全球行业分类标准）在许多环境下已被证明是可靠和稳健的，但它存在一些不可忽视的局限性。从根本上说，GICS是一个单一行业模型，每个企业都被分配到一个组，不管该企业的多样化程度如何。这种方法在像亚马逊这样的大型企业中失效，这些企业的风险敞口分布在多个部门。我们试图通过开发MIS（Multi-Industry Simplex）来克服这些局限性，这是一个概率模型，可以根据数据灵活地将企业分配给尽可能多的行业。特别是，我们利用主题建模，即自然语言处理方法，利用业务描述提取和识别相应的行业。每个识别的行业都附带着一个相关概率，可以进行高度解释。",
