    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型通常作为云服务提供，客户将自己的数据发送给服务提供商以获取结果。这种设置是常见的，由于模型的高价值，但它要求客户放弃查询数据可能包含的隐私。同态加密（HE）是解决这个困境的一种有希望的技术。使用HE，服务提供商可以接收加密的数据作为查询，并运行模型而无需解密。结果保持加密，只有客户可以解密。所有这些好处带来的代价是计算成本，因为HE将简单的浮点运算转化为长（度超过1024）多项式之间的计算。之前的工作已经提出了为在加密数据上进行高效计算而量身定制的深度神经网络，但HE又再次放大了已经很高的计算成本，阻碍了性能改进。在这篇论文中，我们展示了超维计算可以作为保护隐私的机器学习即服务的救援。",
