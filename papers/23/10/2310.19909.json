    "translated_abstract": "基于神经网络的计算机视觉系统通常由一个骨干网络构成，即预训练或随机初始化的特征提取器。几年前，使用ImageNet训练的卷积神经网络是默认选择。然而，最近的发展出现了使用各种算法和数据集进行预训练的众多骨干网络。虽然这种选择丰富性提高了一系列系统的性能，但对于从业者来说，很难做出明智的选择。骨干网络之战（BoB）通过对多种预训练模型进行基准测试，包括视觉-语言模型、自监督学习训练的模型和稳定扩散骨干等等，以及针对从分类到目标检测到OOD泛化等多样的计算机视觉任务进行了比较，从而简化了这个选择过程。此外，BoB通过揭示有希望的研究方向，为研究社区推动计算机视觉进一步发展提供了启示。",
