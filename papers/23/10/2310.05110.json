    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to estimate the expected effects of the pandemic of Covid-19 for child poverty in North Macedonia. We rely on MK-MOD Tax & Benefit Microsimulation Model for North Macedonia based on the Survey on Income and Living Conditions 2019. The simulation takes into account the development of income, as per the observed developments in the first three quarters of 2020, derived from the Labor Force Survey, which incorporates the raw effect of the pandemic and the government response. In North Macedonia, almost no government measure directly aimed the income of children, however, three key and largest measures addressed household income: the wage subsidy of 14.500 MKD per worker in the hardest hit companies, relaxation of the criteria for obtaining the guaranteed minimum income, and one-off support to vulnerable groups of the population in two occasions. Results suggest that the relative child poverty rate is estimated to increase from 27.8 percent before the pandemi",

    "translated_abstract": "本文的目标是估计Covid-19大流行对北马其顿儿童贫困的预期影响。我们依赖于基于2019年收入和生活条件调查的北马其顿MK-MOD税收和福利微观模拟模型。模拟考虑了收入的发展，根据2020年前三个季度的观察结果得出，该结果基于劳动力调查，该调查考虑了大流行的原始影响和政府的应对措施。在北马其顿，几乎没有针对儿童收入的直接政府措施，然而，三项关键且最大的措施涉及家庭收入：最严重受打击公司每名工人的补贴金14500马其顿代纳尔，放宽获得最低保证收入的条件，以及两个场合对弱势群体的一次性支持。结果表明，相对儿童贫困率预计将从疫情前的27.8％增加。",
