    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统在深度学习和图神经网络的影响下取得了显著进展，特别是在捕捉复杂的用户-物品关系方面。然而，这些基于图的推荐系统严重依赖于基于ID的数据，可能忽略了与用户和物品相关的有价值的文本信息，导致学到的表示不够富有信息。此外，隐式反馈数据的利用引入了潜在的噪声和偏差，给用户偏好学习的有效性带来了挑战。尽管将大语言模型（LLMs）与传统的基于ID的推荐系统相结合已经引起了人们的关注，但在实际推荐系统中有效实施还需要解决可扩展性问题、仅依赖文本的限制以及提示输入限制等挑战。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一个模型不可知的框架RLMRec，旨在通过LLM强化表示来增强现有的推荐系统。",
