    "translated_abstract": "通过适应性模型可以减轻由于分布偏移导致的性能下降。然而，隐私问题可能导致模型参数无法访问。一种有前途的方法是利用零阶优化（ZOO）来训练数据适配器，以将测试数据调整到适合已部署的模型。然而，使用ZOO训练的数据适配器通常带来了有限的改进，原因是数据适配器可能导致数据特征的损坏。为了解决这个问题，我们在测试时间数据适应的背景下重新审视了ZOO。我们发现，问题直接来源于用于优化数据适配器的梯度的不可靠估计，这主要是由于分配给测试数据的伪标签的不可靠性。基于这个观察，我们提出了伪标签稳健的数据适应（SODA）来改进数据适应的性能。具体来说，SODA利用高置信度的预测标签作为可靠的参考。",
