    "abstract": "Accurate forecasts of electricity prices are crucial for the management of electric power systems and the development of smart applications. European electricity prices have risen substantially and became highly volatile after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, challenging established forecasting methods. Here, we present a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for the German-Luxembourg day-ahead electricity prices addressing these challenges. The recurrent structure of the LSTM allows the model to adapt to trends, while the joint prediction of both mean and standard deviation enables a probabilistic prediction. Using a physics-inspired approach - superstatistics - to derive an explanation for the statistics of prices, we show that the LSTM model faithfully reproduces both prices and their volatility.",

    "translated_abstract": "准确预测电力价格对电力系统的管理和智能应用的发展至关重要。俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后，欧洲的电力价格大幅上涨并变得高度波动，给已有的预测方法带来了挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种应对这些挑战的德国-卢森堡日前电力价格的长短期记忆网络（LSTM）模型。LSTM的循环结构使得模型能够适应趋势，而对均值和标准差进行联合预测则实现了概率预测。通过使用物理启发方法——超统计学，来解释价格的统计性质，我们展示了LSTM模型对电力价格和波动性的准确复现。",
