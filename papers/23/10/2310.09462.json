    "translated_abstract": "尽管人工智能增强交易方法取得了一定进展，但在快速发展的加密货币市场中开发盈利的自动交易系统仍然具有挑战性。本研究旨在通过开发基于强化学习的自动交易系统来解决这些挑战，针对五种热门的替代加密货币（即比特币以外的加密货币）：币安币、以太坊、莱特币、瑞波币和泰达币。为此，我们提出了CausalReinforceNet，一个被构建为决策支持系统的框架。作为交易系统的基础架构，CausalReinforceNet框架通过因果分析增强了强化学习代理的能力。在该框架内，我们在特征工程过程中使用贝叶斯网络来识别影响加密货币价格变动的具有因果关系的最相关特征。此外，我们还通过动态贝叶斯网络将概率性价格方向信号纳入框架中，以增强交易系统的功能。",
