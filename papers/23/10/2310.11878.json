    "translated_abstract": "在法律自然语言处理中，案例结果分类（COC）不仅需要准确性，还需要可信赖性和可解释性。现有的可解释COC研究仅限于由单个专家进行的注释。然而，众所周知，律师在对案件事实进行评估时可能存在分歧。因此，我们收集了一个新的数据集RAVE：欧洲人权法领域的理由变异，该数据集是从国际人权法领域的两位专家那里获得的，我们观察到他们之间存在弱一致性。我们研究了他们的分歧，并构建了一个两级任务无关的分类体系，同时补充了COC特定的子类别。据我们所知，这是法律自然语言处理领域首次关注人工标注的变异。我们定量评估了不同分类类别，并发现分歧主要源于对法律背景的不明确描述，这在COC元数据通常具有有限细粒度和噪声的情况下带来了挑战。我们进一步评估了SOTA COC模型在RAVE数据集上的可解释性，并观察到...",
