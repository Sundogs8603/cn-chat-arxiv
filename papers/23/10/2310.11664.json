    "translated_abstract": "实际世界的图通常非常复杂，全局结构中存在异构性，而局部邻域内则表现出强烈的异质性。尽管有越来越多的文献揭示了常见图神经网络（GNNs）在处理具有异质性的同构图时的局限性，但在研究异构图中的异质性属性方面却鲜有研究。为填补这一研究空白，我们使用元路径识别了异构图中的异质性，并提出了两个实用的度量指标来定量描述异质性水平。通过对几个展示不同异质性水平的真实世界异构图的深入研究，我们发现继承了很多设计用于同构图的GNNs机制的异构图神经网络（HGNNs）在处理具有异质性或低度同质性的异构图时无法泛化。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了Hetero$^2$Net，一个面向异构图的异质属性感知表示学习方法。",
