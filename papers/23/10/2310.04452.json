    "translated_abstract": "为了分析大量的文本，社会科学研究者越来越面临文本分类的挑战。当无法进行手动标注时，研究者必须找到自动化分类文本的方法，计算机科学为社会科学提供了一个有用的机器学习方法工具箱，其性能在社会科学研究中的应用尚未得到深入研究。本文比较了最常用的文本分类器的性能，将它们应用于社会科学研究中的典型研究场景：一个相对较小的被标记数据集，其中感兴趣的类别很少出现，并且作为一个大型未标记数据集的一部分。以气候变化的Twitter沟通为例，这是一个在交叉学科社会科学研究中越来越受关注的话题。我们使用一个新颖的数据集，包括来自各种国际组织的5750个关于气候变化这个高度模糊概念的推文，评估了不同分类器的性能。",
