    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的普及引发了人们对使用特定领域数据对其进行微调，创建专门的语言模型的兴趣。然而，这种特定领域的微调数据通常包含敏感的个人身份信息（PII）。在没有隐私保护的情况下直接微调 LLMs 会存在信息泄露的风险。为了解决这个挑战，我们引入了隐私保护语言模型（PPLM），这是一种在有效注入领域特定知识的同时保护数据隐私的新范式。我们的工作提供了模型设计的理论分析，并深入研究了各种技术，比如语料库策展、基于惩罚的非概然性训练损失以及基于指令的微调等等。广泛的实验在不同的数据集和场景中验证了我们的方法的有效性。特别是，使用正向和负向示例进行指令微调，显示出很有希望的方法。",
