    "abstract": "This work proposes a novel approach to social robot navigation by learning to generate robot controls from a social motion latent space. By leveraging this social motion latent space, the proposed method achieves significant improvements in social navigation metrics such as success rate, navigation time, and trajectory length while producing smoother (less jerk and angular deviations) and more anticipatory trajectories. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated through comparison with baseline models in various scenarios. Additionally, the concept of humans' awareness towards the robot is introduced into the social robot navigation framework, showing that incorporating human awareness leads to shorter and smoother trajectories owing to humans' ability to positively interact with the robot.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的社交机器人导航方法，通过从社交运动潜空间中学习生成机器人控制，实现了社交导航指标的显著改善，如成功率、导航时间和轨迹长度，同时产生了更平缓的轨迹（减少抖动和角度偏差）和更具预见性的轨迹。通过与基准模型在各种场景中的比较，证明了该方法的优越性。此外，将人类对机器人的意识概念引入社交机器人导航框架中，显示出人类意识的融入能够减少轨迹长度和平滑轨迹，因为人类能够与机器人积极互动。",
