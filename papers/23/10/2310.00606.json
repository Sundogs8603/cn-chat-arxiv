    "translated_abstract": "我们在一个跳跃扩散和随机利率的现实建模环境下，为具有连续提款的保证最小提款收益（GMWBs）开发了一种高效的定价方法。利用冲击随机控制框架，我们将无套利GMWB定价问题形式化为一个时间依赖的Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman（HJB）准变分不等式（QVI），其中拥有三个空间维度和交叉导数项。通过一种新颖的数值方法，将半拉格朗日方法与相关线性偏积分-微分方程的格林函数相结合，我们开发了一种 $\\epsilon$-单调性傅里叶定价方法，其中 $\\epsilon > 0$ 是一个单调性容许度。结合HJB-QVI的可证强比较结果，我们在数学上证明了所提出的方案收敛到HJB-QVI的粘性解，当 $\\epsilon \\to 0$ 时。我们对同时连续提款和投资风险的影响进行了全面研究。",
