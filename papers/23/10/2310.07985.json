    "translated_abstract": "神经组合优化（NCO）是一种有前景的基于学习的方法，可以通过传统的专家算法设计来解决具有挑战性的组合优化问题。然而，大多数构造性的NCO方法不能解决大规模实例大小的问题，这显著降低了它们在实际应用中的实用性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的轻编码器和重解码器（LEHD）模型，具有强大的通用性，以解决这个关键问题。LEHD模型可以动态地学习到不同尺寸的所有可用节点之间的关系，这有利于模型对各种规模的问题进行泛化。此外，我们还为LEHD模型开发了一种数据高效的训练方案和灵活的解决方案构建机制。通过在小规模问题实例上进行训练，LEHD模型可以生成近乎最优的旅行商问题（TSP）和容量限制车辆路径规划问题",
