    "translated_abstract": "多目标表示学习旨在利用多个物体的组合来表示复杂的真实世界视觉输入。表示学习方法通常使用无监督学习将输入图像分割成单个物体，并将这些物体编码到每个潜在向量中。然而，目前尚不清楚先前的方法如何实现适当的物体分割。此外，大多数先前的方法使用变分自动编码器（VAE）对潜在向量进行正则化。因此，尚不清楚VAE正则化是否有助于适当的物体分割。为了阐明多目标表示学习中物体分割的机制，我们对MONet进行了消融研究，这是一种典型的方法。MONet使用由注意力掩码和对应于注意力掩码的潜在向量组成的对来表示多个物体。每个潜在向量都是从输入图像和注意力掩码中编码的。",
