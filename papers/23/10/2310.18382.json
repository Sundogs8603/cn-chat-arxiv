    "translated_abstract": "生成人工智能（GAI）具有生成逼真数据和促进高级决策的能力。通过将GAI集成到现代物联网（IoT）中，生成物联网（GIoT）正在兴起，具有革命化社会各个方面的巨大潜力，可实现更高效和智能的物联网应用，如智能监控和语音助手。在本文中，我们介绍了GIoT的概念，并探索了其潜在前景。具体而言，我们首先概述了四种GAI技术，并研究了有前景的GIoT应用。然后，我们详细阐述了实现GIoT面临的主要挑战，并提出了一个基于GAI的安全激励机制框架来解决这些挑战，在该框架中，我们采用了生成扩散模型（GDM）进行激励机制设计，并应用区块链技术进行安全的GIoT管理。此外，我们对现代车辆交通监控进行了案例研究。",
