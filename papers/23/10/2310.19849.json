    "translated_abstract": "很多关键生物过程依赖于蛋白质相互作用网络。预测氨基酸突变对蛋白质相互作用的影响对于蛋白质工程和药物发现至关重要。然而，关于结合能的实验数据的稀缺性给基于深度学习的计算方法带来了重大挑战。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于表示学习的方法——SidechainDiff，它利用未标记的实验蛋白质结构。SidechainDiff利用黎曼扩散模型学习侧链构象的生成过程，并可以给出蛋白质相互作用界面上突变的结构上下文表示。通过利用学到的表示，我们在预测蛋白质相互作用的突变效应方面取得了最先进的性能。此外，SidechainDiff是第一个基于扩散的侧链生成模型，可以区分不同的侧链。",
