    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在各种实际任务中展现出了卓越的性能。然而，理解其有效性的根本原因仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。通过检查神经元来解释深度神经网络在探索神经网络的内部机制方面具有独特的优势。先前的研究表明，深度视觉网络中的特定神经元具有语义含义，并在模型性能中起到关键作用。然而，当前生成神经元语义的方法严重依赖于人为干预，这限制了其可扩展性和适用性。为了解决这个限制，本文提出了一个新的事后框架，用于生成大型基础模型的神经元的语义解释，而不需要人为干预或先前知识。我们的框架被设计为与各种模型架构和数据集兼容，便于自动化和可扩展的神经元解释生成。",
