Then, time series features (TSFs), the wisdom of many researchers, are derived and realize HAR using MLP. Although a model that does not use CNN, it achieved the highest accuracy than existing models under well-managed benchmark conditions and multiple datasets: UCI HAR, PAMAP2, Daphnet, and OPPORTUNITY, which target different activities.",
