However, the limited pocket-ligand complex structures available in the PDB database (less than 100 thousand non-redundant pairs) hampers large-scale pretraining endeavors for interaction modeling. To address this constraint, we propose a novel pocket pretraining approach that leverages knowledge from high-resolution atomic protein structures, assisted by highly effective pretrained small molecule representations. By segmenting protein structures into drug-like fragments and their corresponding pockets, we obtain a reasonable simulation of ligand-receptor interactions, resulting in the generation of over 5 million complexes",

    "translated_abstract": "口袋表示在各种生物医学应用中起着重要作用，如药物可裸露性估计、配体亲和力预测和新药设计等。然而，现有的几何特征和预训练表示通常将口袋独立于配体处理，忽略了它们之间的基本相互作用。我们提出了一种新颖的口袋预训练方法，借助高分辨率原子蛋白质结构的知识，并辅以高效的预训练小分子表示。将蛋白质结构分段为类似药物的片段及其相应的口袋，我们得到了一种合理的配体-受体相互作用模拟，从而生成了超过500万个复合物。",
