    "translated_abstract": "随机博弈是一个为多智能体在不确定性下进行序列决策的模型。然而在现实中，智能体对环境只有部分可观测性，这使得问题在计算上具有挑战性，即使在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程的单智能体环境中也是如此。此外，在实践中，智能体越来越多地使用基于数据的方法，例如在连续数据上训练的神经网络来感知环境。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了神经符号化部分可观测随机博弈（NS-POSGs）的模型，这是连续空间并发随机博弈的一种变体，明确地融入了感知机制。我们专注于单方面的设置，包含了一个具有离散、基于数据驱动的观测和一个具有连续观测的充分了解的智能体。我们提出了一种名为单边NS-HSVI的基于点的方法，用来近似计算单方面NS-POSGs的值，并进行了实现。",
