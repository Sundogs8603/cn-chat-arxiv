    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了两种在高斯混合模型集合上的Gromov-Wasserstein类型距离。第一种距离是在高斯测度空间上两个离散分布的Gromov-Wasserstein距离。该距离可以作为Gromov-Wasserstein的替代，用于评估分布之间的距离，但不能直接推导出最优的运输方案。为了设计出这样的运输方案，我们引入了另一种在不可比较的空间中的测度之间的距离，该距离与Gromov-Wasserstein密切相关。当将允许的运输耦合限制为高斯混合模型时，这定义了另一种高斯混合模型之间的距离，可以作为Gromov-Wasserstein的另一种替代，并允许推导出最优的点分配方案。",
