    "translated_abstract": "学习下棋策略已经被广泛研究，大多数研究关注于使用搜索算法从之前的棋局中学习。棋局教程包含大师的知识，解释下棋策略，并且相比传统的下棋方法需要更小的搜索空间。本文探讨了棋局教程作为一种新的知识来源，以便使机器学会下棋，这是以前未曾探索的资源。我们开发了LEAP语料库，这是第一个新颖且具有结构化（棋局走法和局面状态）和非结构化（文字描述）数据的异构数据集，收集自一本含有1164个句子的棋局教程，讨论了91场比赛的战略走法。我们首先根据句子的相关性对其进行标注，即它们是否讨论了一次走法。然后，我们根据描述的走法对每个相关句子进行情感标注。我们进行了实证实验，评估了各种训练方法的性能。",
