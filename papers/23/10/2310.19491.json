    "abstract": "In this paper, we present conditions for identifying the generator of a linear stochastic differential equation (SDE) from the distribution of its solution process with a given fixed initial state. These identifiability conditions are crucial in causal inference using linear SDEs as they enable the identification of the post-intervention distributions from its observational distribution. Specifically, we derive a sufficient and necessary condition for identifying the generator of linear SDEs with additive noise, as well as a sufficient condition for identifying the generator of linear SDEs with multiplicative noise. We show that the conditions derived for both types of SDEs are generic. Moreover, we offer geometric interpretations of the derived identifiability conditions to enhance their understanding. To validate our theoretical results, we perform a series of simulations, which support and substantiate the established findings.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种从具有给定固定初始状态的解过程的分布中识别线性随机微分方程（SDE）的发生器的条件。这些可识别性条件在使用线性SDE进行因果推断时至关重要，因为它们使得可以从其观测分布中识别出干预后的分布。我们具体推导出了识别具有加性噪声的线性SDE的发生器的充分必要条件，以及识别具有乘性噪声的线性SDE的发生器的充分条件。我们证明了对于两种类型的SDE，得到的条件是一般性的。此外，我们提供了对得到的可识别性条件的几何解释，以增强对其的理解。为了验证我们的理论结果，我们进行了一系列的模拟实验，这些实验支持并证实了我们所得到的结果。",
