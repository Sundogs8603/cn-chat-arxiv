Concretely, we (1) sample from the optimal Gibbs posterior using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, (2) estimate its KL divergence from the prior with thermodynamic integration, and (3) propose three methods to obtain high-probability bounds under different assumptions. Our experiments on the MNIST dataset reveal significant tightness gaps, as much as 5-6\\% in some cases.",

    "translated_abstract": "PAC-Bayes文献中一个重要但未被充分研究的问题是在优化PAC-Bayes界限时，通过限制后验分布为因子化高斯分布，我们失去了多少紧致度。我们通过估计独立于数据的PAC-Bayes界限来调查此问题，使用最优的后验与使用MFVI得到的界限进行比较。具体而言，我们采用Hamiltonian Monte Carlo从最优的Gibbs后验中进行采样，用热力学积分估计其与先验的KL散度，并提出了三种在不同假设下获得高概率界限的方法。我们在MNIST数据集上的实验揭示了显著的紧致度差距，在某些情况下可达5-6％。",
