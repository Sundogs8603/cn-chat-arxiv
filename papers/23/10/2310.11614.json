    "translated_abstract": "机器从人类获得知识的一种典型方式是通过编程。与从演示或经验中学习相比，编程学习允许机器在编写程序时就能获得新的技能，并通过建立程序库，机器可以快速学习如何执行复杂任务。然而，由于程序往往默认执行环境不变，当环境发生变化时，复杂程序的适应性变差，使得将复杂程序适应新环境变得困难。本文介绍了一种将编程学习与层次规划器相结合的自然编程库学习系统。自然编程通过维护一个包含目标、目标如何分解为子目标的语言描述，以及具体分解为子目标的实例的分解库，用户可以通过课程构建的方式教导系统，选择一个具有挑战但不是不可能达到的目标，并提供关于如何达成这一目标的提示。",
