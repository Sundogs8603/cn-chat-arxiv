    "translated_abstract": "当需要同时学习多个相似任务时，多任务学习（MTL）模型可以比单任务学习（STL）模型达到显著更高的准确性。然而，MTL的优势取决于各种因素，如任务的相似性、数据集的大小等；实际上，一些任务可能并不适合MTL，甚至与STL相比会导致准确性下降。因此，问题就出现了：应该将哪些任务一起学习？领域专家可以根据直觉、经验和最佳实践来尝试将任务分组在一起，但手动分组可能既耗时又远非最佳。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的自动任务分组方法。首先，我们使用四个在MTL文献中广泛使用的基准数据集研究了任务对MTL的亲和力，重点是基于神经网络的MTL模型。我们确定了任务的固有特征和STL特性，可以帮助我们预测一个任务组是否适合进行MTL。",
