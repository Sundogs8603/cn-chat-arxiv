    "translated_abstract": "本文对使用加性Matern核在单输出高斯过程（GP）模型中的普遍做法进行了批判性分析，并探讨了用于多输出GP模型的乘法Matern核的性质。对于单输出情况，我们推导出一系列理论结果，表明Matern核混合的平滑性由最不平滑的组件决定，并且具有这样核的GP实际上等价于最不平滑的核组件。此外，我们证明了各个核组件中的混合权重或参数均无法识别。然后，我们将注意力转向多输出GP模型，并分析了乘法核$K(x,y) = AK_0(x,y)$中协方差矩阵$A$的可识别性，其中$K_0$是标准的单输出核，如Matern。我们展示了$A$在乘法常数上是可识别的，这表明乘法混合是可行的。",
