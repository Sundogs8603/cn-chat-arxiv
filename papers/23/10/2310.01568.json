    "translated_abstract": "作者身份识别已经证明了其在推断未署名文档的作者身份方面的高效性，即使在仔细删除敏感个人信息的情况下。在数字时代，个人通过其书面内容留下了持久的数字足迹，不论是在社交媒体上发布，保存在雇主的计算机上，还是其他地方。当个人需要公开交流但希望保持匿名时，几乎没有什么可用的方法来保护他们免受不想要的作者身份识别。这种前所未有的隐私威胁在像揭发丑闻的情况下是显而易见的。针对作者身份识别攻击的提出的防御方法主要旨在混淆个人的写作风格，从而使其与其先前的写作不可关联，同时保持原始的意义和语法完整性。本文提供了对过去两个世纪以来这一研究领域的进展的全面回顾。",
    "tldr": "本文回顾了作者身份识别领域的研究进展，主要关注如何通过混淆写作风格来保护公开交流中的匿名性。",
