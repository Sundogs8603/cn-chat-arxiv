    "abstract": "Authorship verification (AV) is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics, with applications in forensic analysis, plagiarism detection, and identification of deceptive content. Existing AV techniques, including traditional stylometric and deep learning approaches, face limitations in terms of data requirements and lack of explainability. To address these limitations, this paper proposes PromptAV, a novel technique that leverages Large-Language Models (LLMs) for AV by providing step-by-step stylometric explanation prompts. PromptAV outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, operates effectively with limited training data, and enhances interpretability through intuitive explanations, showcasing its potential as an effective and interpretable solution for the AV task.",

    "translated_abstract": "作者验证（AV）是自然语言处理（NLP）和计算语言学中的一项基本任务，其应用领域包括法庭分析、抄袭检测和识别欺骗性内容。现有的AV技术，包括传统的风格测量和深度学习方法，在数据需求和解释能力方面存在局限性。为了解决这些限制，本文提出了PromptAV，一种利用大语言模型（LLMs）进行AV的新技术，通过提供逐步的风格测量解释提示。PromptAV优于最先进的基线方法，在有限的训练数据下运行效果显著，并通过直观的解释增强了可解释性，展示了其作为AV任务的有效和可解释解决方案的潜力。",
