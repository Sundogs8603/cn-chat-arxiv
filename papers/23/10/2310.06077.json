    "translated_abstract": "时间序列预测是各个领域中的一个关键挑战，在近年来取得了实质性的进展。许多现实生活场景，如公共卫生、经济和社会应用，涉及到反馈循环，其中预测结果可能会影响到预测的结果，进而改变目标变量的分布。这种现象被称为展示性，引入了可能出现“自我抵消”或“自我实现”的预测的潜力。尽管在各个领域中对分类问题进行了广泛的研究，但展示性在机器学习视角下的时间序列预测问题尚未得到广泛探讨。在这篇论文中，我们对可展示的时间序列预测（PeTS）进行了形式化，解决了当可能存在展示性引起的分布变化时的准确预测挑战。我们提出了一种新颖方法，特征展示性转移（FPS），它利用延迟响应的概念来预测分布的变化和随后的变量。",
