    "translated_abstract": "预训练大模型（PLMs）具有出色的泛化、上下文学习和出现能力，可以处理没有直接训练数据的特定任务，使它们成为对抗领域适应（ADA）方法中将从源领域学习的知识转移至目标领域的更好的基础模型。然而，现有的ADA方法未能正确考虑混淆因素，混淆因素是导致源数据分布与目标领域不同的根本原因。本研究提出了一种用于PLMs微调的对抗领域适应与混淆平衡（ADA-CBF）方法。ADA-CBF包括一个PLM作为特征提取器的基础模型，以及一个领域分类器和一个混淆分类器，它们通过对抗损失进行联合训练。这个损失旨在通过减弱领域分类器中的歧视来改进领域不变的表示学习。同时，对抗损失也平衡混淆因子的分布。",
