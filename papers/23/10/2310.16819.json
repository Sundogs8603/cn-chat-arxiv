    "translated_abstract": "在有关两种治疗方法的因果推断中，有条件的平均处理效应（CATE）作为表示个性化因果效应的重要指标起着重要作用，它被定义为在协变量条件下两种治疗方法的预期结果之间的差异。本研究假设两个线性回归模型，用于描述潜在结果与两种治疗方法的协变量之间的关系，并将CATE定义为两个线性回归模型之间的差异。然后，我们提出了一种方法，可以在高维度和非稀疏参数的情况下一致地估计CATE。在我们的研究中，我们证明了即使不显式假设稀疏性，仍然可以获得如一致性等理论性质，只要我们假设CATE的定义源自一个称为隐式稀疏性的较弱假设。在这个假设中，我们假设潜在结果中线性模型的参数可以分为特定于治疗方法和公共参数，其中特定于治疗方法的参数可被实现的估计。",
