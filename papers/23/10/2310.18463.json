    "translated_abstract": "生物医学三元组提取系统旨在自动提取生物医学实体和实体之间的关系。虽然当前的统一信息提取模型展示了最先进的性能，但在理解复杂生物医学句子中实体之间的关系方面面临挑战。此外，缺乏高质量的生物医学三元组提取数据集阻碍了稳健的三元组提取系统的开发进展。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的适用于生物医学三元组提取的基于检索的框架，名为PeTailor，它使用一种新颖的定制分块评分器从我们预先构建的多样分块数据库中显式地检索相关文档，并将检索到的信息集成到大型语言模型（LLM）的输入中，为输入的句子生成相应的三元组（头实体，关系，尾实体）。此外，我们还提供了GM-CIHT，一种专家标注的生物医学三元组提取数据集，该数据集支持了我们的方法的实验评估。",
