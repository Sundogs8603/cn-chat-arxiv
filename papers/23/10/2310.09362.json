    "abstract": "In the wake of the post-pandemic era, marked by social isolation and surging rates of depression and anxiety, conversational agents based on digital psychotherapy can play an influential role compared to traditional therapy sessions. In this work, we develop a voice-capable chatbot in Farsi to guide users through Self-Attachment (SAT), a novel, self-administered, holistic psychological technique based on attachment theory. Our chatbot uses a dynamic array of rule-based and classification-based modules to comprehend user input throughout the conversation and navigates a dialogue flowchart accordingly, recommending appropriate SAT exercises that depend on the user's emotional and mental state. In particular, we collect a dataset of over 6,000 utterances and develop a novel sentiment-analysis module that classifies user sentiment into 12 classes, with accuracy above 92%. To keep the conversation novel and engaging, the chatbot's responses are retrieved from a large dataset of utterances c",

    "translated_abstract": "在后疫情时代，社交孤立和抑郁焦虑症的患病率攀升的背景下，基于数字心理疗法的对话代理相对于传统疗法会发挥重要的影响。本文中，我们开发了一个能够发出声音的波斯语聊天机器人，指导用户进行自我依恋(Self-Attachment, SAT)技术，这是一种基于依恋理论的新型、自我管理、全面的心理技术。我们的聊天机器人使用一系列基于规则和分类的模块来理解用户在对话中的输入，并相应地导航对话流程图，根据用户的情感和心理状态推荐适当的SAT练习。具体而言，我们收集了超过6,000次话语的数据集，并开发了一种新颖的情感分析模块，可以将用户的情感分为12个类别，准确率超过92%。为了保持对话的新颖和吸引力，聊天机器人的回答是从大量话语数据集中检索得到的。",
