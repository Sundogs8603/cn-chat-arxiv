    "translated_abstract": "该论文介绍了PCGPT框架，这是一种使用离线强化学习和Transformer网络进行程序化内容生成(PCG)的创新方法。 PCGPT利用基于Transformer的自回归模型迭代生成游戏关卡，解决了传统PCG方法中重复、可预测或不一致内容的挑战。该框架通过捕捉时间依赖性和因果关系的Transformer自注意机制，对动作、状态和奖励的轨迹进行建模。该方法在Sokoban益智游戏中进行了评估，模型预测所需物品及其相应位置。在Sokoban游戏的实验结果表明，PCGPT生成了更复杂和多样化的游戏内容。有趣的是，与现有方法相比，它以显著较少的步骤实现了这些结果，展示了改进游戏设计和在线内容生成的潜力。",
