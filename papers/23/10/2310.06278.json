    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人工智能（AI）和机器学习（ML）正在重新塑造社会的生产方式和生产力，并改变科学研究的范 paradigm。其中，以ChatGPT为代表的AI语言模型取得了巨大进展。这种大型语言模型（LLM）以AI生成的内容（AIGC）的形式服务于人们，并广泛应用于咨询、医疗和教育。然而，很难保证AIGC学习数据的真实性和可靠性。此外，分布式AI训练中也存在隐患的隐私泄露问题。此外，LLMs生成的内容很难识别和追踪，难以跨平台相互认可。在以LLMs为动力的AI时代即将到来之际，上述信息安全问题将被无限放大，影响每个人的生活。因此，我们考虑利用区块链技术为LLMs赋予卓越的安全特性，提出了一个愿景。",
