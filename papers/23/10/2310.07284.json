    "translated_abstract": "人类拥有一种在复杂的声学环境中有选择性地专注于感兴趣的声音源的非凡能力，通常称为鸡尾酒会场景。为了在机器中复制这种引人注目的听觉注意能力，研究人员开发了目标说话人提取(TSE)模型。这些模型利用目标说话人的预先注册线索来提取感兴趣的声源。然而，在真实世界的情景中，这些模型的有效性受到了预先注册线索的可能变化甚至缺失的限制。为了解决这个限制，本研究调查了将自然语言整合到现有TSE模型中以增强其灵活性和可控性的方法。具体而言，我们提出了一个名为LLM-TSE的模型，其中使用大型语言模型(LLM)从用户的键入文本输入中提取有用的语义线索，这些线索可以补充预先注册的线索或独立工作以控制TSE过程。",
