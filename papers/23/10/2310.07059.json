In this paper, we present DKEC, Domain Knowledge Enhanced Classifier for medical diagnosis prediction with two innovations: (1) a label-wise attention mechanism that incorporates a heterogeneous graph and domain ontologies to capture the semantic relationships between medical entities, (2) a simple yet effective group-wise training method based on similarity of labels to increase samples of rare classes. We evaluate DKEC on two real-world medical datasets: the RAA dataset, a collection of 4,417 patient care reports from emergency medical services (EMS) incidents, and a subset of 53,898 reports from the ",

    "translated_abstract": "医学领域的多标签文本分类任务经常面临长尾标签分布，即罕见类别的训练样本少于频繁类别。虽然之前的工作已经探索了不同的模型架构和层次化标签结构来找到重要特征，但大多数忽略了从医学指南中融入领域知识。本文提出了DKEC，一种增强医学诊断预测的领域知识增强分类器，其中包括两个创新点：（1）一个基于标签的注意力机制，结合异构图和领域本体来捕捉医学实体之间的语义关系，（2）一种基于标签相似性的简单而有效的组内训练方法，用于增加罕见类别的样本数量。我们在两个真实的医学数据集上评估了DKEC：RAA数据集，包含来自急救服务（EMS）事件的4,417个患者护理报告的收集，和来自53898报告的子集。",
