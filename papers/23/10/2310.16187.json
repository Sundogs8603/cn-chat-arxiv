    "translated_abstract": "变分数据同化（DA）已被广泛应用于工程问题中，通过对多源噪声数据的加权组合来进行场景重建和预测。近年来，深度学习（DL）技术在数据同化中的应用显示出在高维动力系统中提高效率和准确性的潜力。然而，现有的深度数据同化方法在处理非结构化观测数据时面临困难，特别是当传感器的位置和数量随时间动态变化时。我们引入了一种新的变分数据同化方案，名为Voronoi-tessellation Inverse operator for VariatIonal Data assimilation（VIVID），它将DL逆算子纳入同化目标函数中。通过利用Voronoi-tessellation和卷积神经网络的能力，VIVID能够处理稀疏、非结构化和时变的传感器数据。此外，DL逆算子的引入还建立了一个高效的数据同化框架。",
