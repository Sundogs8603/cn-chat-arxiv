    "translated_abstract": "金融情感分析对于估值和投资决策至关重要。然而，传统的自然语言处理模型受其参数规模和训练数据集范围的限制，其泛化能力和在该领域的有效性受到了限制。最近，以广泛语料库进行预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）由于其令人称赞的零样本能力，在各种自然语言处理任务中展示了优越的性能。然而，直接将LLMs应用于金融情感分析存在挑战：LLMs的预训练目标与情感标签预测之间的差异可能会 compromise其预测性能。此外，金融新闻的简洁性，常常缺乏足够的上下文，也可能会显著降低LLMs的情感分析可靠性。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一个用于金融情感分析的检索增强型LLMs框架。",
