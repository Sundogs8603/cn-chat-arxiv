    "translated_abstract": "自从它们诞生以来，机器人和人工智能（AI）就密不可分地联系在一起。如今，AI-机器人系统已经成为我们日常生活的重要组成部分，从机器人吸尘器到半自动驾驶汽车。这些系统建立在三个基本的架构元素上：感知、导航与规划，以及控制。然而，尽管AI-机器人系统的整合提高了我们生活的质量，但也带来了一个严重的问题 - 这些系统容易受到安全攻击。构成AI-机器人系统的物理组件、算法和数据可能会被恶意行为者利用，可能导致严重后果。基于应对AI-机器人系统中的安全问题的需求，本文在攻击面、道德和法律问题以及人机交互安全三个维度上提供了一份全面的调查和分类。我们的目标是为用户、开发者和其他利益相关者提供指导。",
