    "translated_abstract": "在抗癌药物开发中，一个主要的科学挑战是解开患者肿瘤样本的高维基因组数据、相应肿瘤的器官来源、与给定治疗相关的药物靶点以及 resulting treatment response 之间的复杂关系。此外，为了实现精准医学在根据治疗反应识别和调整患者治疗方案的愿景，有必要构建能够整合纵向肿瘤大小和多模态、高内容数据的肿瘤动态模型。在这项工作中，我们通过提出一个异构图编码器，结合了一个双分图图卷积神经网络（GCN）和神经常微分方程（神经-ODEs），迈向增强个性化肿瘤动态预测的一步。我们将该方法应用于大量来源于患者的异种移植模型（PDX）数据。",
