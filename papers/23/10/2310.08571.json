We propose Bucks for Buckets (B4B), the first active defense that prevents stealing while the attack is happening without degrading representation quality for legitimate API users. Our defense relies on the observation that the representations returned to adversaries who try to steal the encoder's functionality cover a significantly larger fraction of the embedding space than representations of legitimate users who utilize the encoder to solve a particular downstream task.vB4B leverages this to adaptively adjust the utility of the returned representations according to a user's coverage of the embedding sp",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习即服务（MLaaS）API提供了现成且高效的编码器，用于生成给定输入的向量表示。由于这些编码器的训练成本很高，它们成为模型盗取攻击的有利目标，攻击者利用对API的查询访问，在原始训练成本的一小部分情况下本地复制编码器。我们提出了Bucks for Buckets (B4B)，这是第一个在攻击发生时能防止盗取并且不会降低合法用户的表示质量的主动防御方法。我们的防御方法依赖于以下观察结果：尝试盗取编码器功能的攻击者返回的表示涵盖了嵌入空间的一个显着较大的部分，相比之下，利用编码器解决特定下游任务的合法用户的表示涵盖范围较小。B4B利用这一点根据用户对嵌入空间的覆盖情况自适应调整返回表示的效用。",
