    "translated_abstract": "对于给定的系统，运行时保证系统（RTA）允许使用不可信或实验性的控制器，同时通过备份（或安全）控制器来确保安全。相关的计算设计问题是通过根据需要切换到安全控制器来确保安全，同时最大化一些性能指标（例如不可信控制器的利用率）的逻辑。现有的RTA设计策略被广泛认为过于保守，原则上可能导致安全违规。在本文中，我们将最佳RTA设计问题进行了建模，并提出了一种新的解决方法。我们的方法依赖于奖励塑形和强化学习，可以保证安全，并利用机器学习技术实现可扩展性。我们已经实现了这个算法，并在一些使用3D空间飞机模型的场景中，通过实验结果将我们的方法与最先进的可达性和基于模拟的RTA方法进行了对比。",
