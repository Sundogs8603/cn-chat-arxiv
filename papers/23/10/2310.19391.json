    "abstract": "Despite the essential need for comprehensive considerations in responsible AI, factors like robustness, fairness, and causality are often studied in isolation. Adversarial perturbation, used to identify vulnerabilities in models, and individual fairness, aiming for equitable treatment of similar individuals, despite initial differences, both depend on metrics to generate comparable input data instances. Previous attempts to define such joint metrics often lack general assumptions about data or structural causal models and were unable to reflect counterfactual proximity. To address this, our paper introduces a causal fair metric formulated based on causal structures encompassing sensitive attributes and protected causal perturbation. To enhance the practicality of our metric, we propose metric learning as a method for metric estimation and deployment in real-world problems in the absence of structural causal models. We also demonstrate the application of our novel metric in classifiers.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管负责任AI需要全面考虑因素，如鲁棒性、公平性和因果性，但这些因素常常被孤立地研究。用于识别模型中的漏洞的对抗扰动和为相似个体提供公平处理的个体公平性，尽管最初存在差异，但都依赖于生成可比较的输入数据实例的度量。以往关于定义这种联合度量的尝试往往缺乏关于数据或结构因果模型的一般假设，并且无法反映反事实的接近度。为了解决这个问题，我们的论文引入了一种基于因果结构的因果公平度量，包含敏感属性和受保护的因果扰动。为了增强我们的度量的实用性，在没有结构因果模型的情况下，我们提出了度量学习作为度量估计和在现实世界问题中部署的方法。我们还展示了我们的新度量在分类器中的应用。",
