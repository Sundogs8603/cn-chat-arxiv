    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）如ChatGPT在最近几年取得了显著进展，并且现在正被公众使用。随着越来越多的人与这些系统互动，提高我们对这些黑盒模型的理解尤为关键，特别是关于它们对人类心理方面的理解。在这项研究中，我们通过使用应对和评估理论中的评估维度来调查它们对情感的感知，使用了应激与应对过程问卷（SCPQ）。SCPQ是一个经过验证的临床工具，由多个随时间而演变且在关键评估变量（如可控性和可变性）上有所不同的故事组成。我们将SCPQ应用于OpenAI的三个最新LLM（davinci-003、ChatGPT和GPT-4），并将结果与评估理论和人类数据的预测进行对比。结果显示，LLM的响应在评估和应对的动态方面与人类类似，但它们的响应在关键评估维度上与预测的不一致。",
