    "abstract": "Continual pre-training has been urgent for adapting a pre-trained model to a multitude of domains and tasks in the fast-evolving world. In practice, a continually pre-trained model is expected to demonstrate not only greater capacity when fine-tuned on pre-trained domains but also a non-decreasing performance on unseen ones. In this work, we first investigate such anytime fine-tuning effectiveness of existing continual pre-training approaches, concluding with unanimously decreased performance on unseen domains. To this end, we propose a prompt-guided continual pre-training method, where we train a hypernetwork to generate domain-specific prompts by both agreement and disagreement losses. The agreement loss maximally preserves the generalization of a pre-trained model to new domains, and the disagreement one guards the exclusiveness of the generated hidden states for each domain. Remarkably, prompts by the hypernetwork alleviate the domain identity when fine-tuning and promote knowledge",

    "translated_abstract": "在快速发展的世界中，持续预训练对于使预训练模型适应各种领域和任务变得迫切。在实践中，持续预训练模型被期望不仅在预训练领域上进行微调时具有更大的容量，而且在未知领域上的性能不会下降。在本文中，我们首先调查了现有持续预训练方法的随时微调效果，得出了对未知领域的普遍性能下降的结论。为此，我们提出了一种基于提示的持续预训练方法，通过一致性和不一致性损失训练超网络生成特定领域的提示。一致性损失最大程度地保留了预训练模型对新领域的泛化能力，而不一致性损失则保护了为每个领域生成的隐藏状态的独特性。显著的是，超网络生成的提示在微调时减轻了领域特异性并促进了知识的传递。",
