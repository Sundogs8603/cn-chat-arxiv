    "abstract": "We present a novel method for precise 3D object localization in single images from a single calibrated camera using only 2D labels. No expensive 3D labels are needed. Thus, instead of using 3D labels, our model is trained with easy-to-annotate 2D labels along with the physical knowledge of the object's motion. Given this information, the model can infer the latent third dimension, even though it has never seen this information during training. Our method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and we are able to achieve a mean distance error of just 6 cm in our experiments on real data. The results indicate the method's potential as a step towards learning 3D object location estimation, where collecting 3D data for training is not feasible.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的方法，利用物体的运动物理知识和简单的2D标注，从单个校准相机的单个图像中精确定位3D物体，无需昂贵的3D标注。在训练过程中，模型能够推断出隐含的第三个维度，即使在训练时从未见过此信息。我们在合成和真实世界数据集上评估了该方法，并在真实数据实验中实现了平均距离误差仅为6厘米。结果表明该方法在无法收集3D数据进行训练的情况下，作为学习3D物体定位估计的一步具有潜力。",
