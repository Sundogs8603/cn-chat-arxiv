In this paper, I fully characterize when and how such an improvement can be guaranteed under all possible DGPs and develop inference methods to achieve it. These inference methods are needed because, as this paper shows, common inference methods (e.g., maximum likelihood or Bayesian) often fail to deliver such an improvement.

    "translated_abstract": "决策者面临由数据生成过程(DGP)控制的不确定性，这些过程可能只属于一组独立但可能非相同分布的序列。鲁棒决策在这个集合中最大化决策者对最坏情况DGP的预期收益。本文研究了如何通过数据改善这些鲁棒决策，其中改善通过真实DGP下的预期收益来衡量。本文完全描述了在所有可能的DGP下保证这种改善的时间和方式，并开发了推理方法来实现它。这些推理方法是必需的，因为本文表明，常见的推理方法（如最大似然或贝叶斯）通常无法实现这种改善。重要的是，开发的推理方法是通过对标准推理程序进行简单扩展获得的，因此在实践中很容易实现。",
