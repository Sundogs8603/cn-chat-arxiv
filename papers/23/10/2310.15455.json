    "abstract": "The recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have stimulated interest among researchers and industry professionals, particularly in their application to tasks concerning mobile user interfaces (UIs). This position paper investigates the use of LLMs for UI layout generation. Central to our exploration is the introduction of UI grammar -- a novel approach we proposed to represent the hierarchical structure inherent in UI screens. The aim of this approach is to guide the generative capacities of LLMs more effectively and improve the explainability and controllability of the process. Initial experiments conducted with GPT-4 showed the promising capability of LLMs to produce high-quality user interfaces via in-context learning. Furthermore, our preliminary comparative study suggested the potential of the grammar-based approach in improving the quality of generative results in specific aspects.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近大型语言模型（LLM）的进展引起了研究人员和行业专业人员的兴趣，特别是在与移动用户界面（UI）相关的任务中应用LLMs。本文探讨了使用LLMs进行UI布局生成的方法。我们引入了UI语法作为我们提出的一种新颖方法，来表示UI屏幕中固有的分层结构。该方法的目的是更有效地指导LLMs的生成能力，提高生成过程的可解释性和可控性。我们使用GPT-4进行了初步实验，结果显示LLMs通过上下文学习有可能生成高质量的用户界面。此外，我们的初步比较研究表明基于语法的方法在特定方面有改进生成结果质量的潜力。",
