    "translated_abstract": "搜索引擎生成和索引的大量数据对于有效和高效地检索文档构成了重要挑战。即使使用精心设计的查询，一些相关文档经常被淹没在竞争文档的海量中，导致所需文档的可获取性或\"可发现性\"降低。因此，开发一种强大的方法来评估信息检索系统性能中的这个维度至关重要。尽管之前的研究集中于测量文档的可访问性，而忽略了用户查询和文档的相关性，但目前还不存在一种度量指标来量化在给定的信息检索系统中文档的可发现性，而无需进行手动操作。本文旨在通过定义和推导出一种度量指标，以评估最终用户对文档的可发现性。通过实验，我们展示了不同检索模型和检索集合对可发现性的不同影响。",
