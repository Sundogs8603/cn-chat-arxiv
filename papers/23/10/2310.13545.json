However, theoretical understandings of the instability of UNet in diffusion models and also the performance improvement of LSC scaling remain absent yet. To solve this issue, we theoretically show that the coefficients of LSCs in UNet have big effects on the stableness of the forward and backward propagation and robustness of UNet.

    "translated_abstract": "在扩散模型中，UNet是最受欢迎的网络骨干，因为其长跳接连接可以聚合远距离信息并减轻消失梯度问题。不幸的是，在扩散模型中，UNet经常遭受不稳定的训练，通过缩小其长跳接连接系数可以缓解该问题。然而，关于UNet在扩散模型中的不稳定性以及长跳接连接缩放的性能改进的理论理解尚未出现。为了解决这个问题，我们从理论上证明了UNet中长跳接连接系数对前向和后向传播的稳定性以及UNet的鲁棒性有很大影响。具体而言，UNet在任何层的隐藏特征和梯度都会振荡，其振荡范围实际上很大，这解释了UNet训练的不稳定性。此外，UNet对扰动输入也具有敏感性，并且会产生与期望输出相距较远的输出，从而产生振荡效果。",
