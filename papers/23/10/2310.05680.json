    "abstract": "The count of pending cases has shown an exponential rise across nations (e.g., with more than 10 million pending cases in India alone). The main issue lies in the fact that the number of cases submitted to the law system is far greater than the available number of legal professionals present in a country. Given this worldwide context, the utilization of AI technology has gained paramount importance to enhance the efficiency and speed of legal procedures. In this study we partcularly focus on helping legal professionals in the process of analyzing a legal case. Our specific investigation delves into harnessing the generative capabilities of open-sourced large language models to create arguments derived from the facts present in legal cases. Experimental results show that the generated arguments from the best performing method have on average 63% overlap with the benchmark set gold standard annotations.",

    "translated_abstract": "在全球范围内，待处理案件数量呈指数增长（例如，仅在印度就有超过1000万个待处理案件）。主要问题在于提交给法律系统的案件数量远远超过一个国家中现有的法律专业人员的数量。在这个全球背景下，利用人工智能技术来提高法律程序的效率和速度变得至关重要。在本研究中，我们特别关注帮助法律专业人员分析法律案件的过程。我们的具体调查探索了利用开源大型语言模型的生成能力，从法律案件中提取出论证。实验结果表明，最佳方法生成的论证与基准集的黄金标准注释平均重叠率为63%。",
