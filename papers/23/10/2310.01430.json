With this work, we aim to perform a rigorous benchmarking of the MUStARD++ dataset by considering state-of-the-art language, speech, and visual encoders, for fully utilizing the totality of the multi-modal richness that it has to offer, achieving a 2\\% improvement in macro-F1 over the existing benchmark. Additionally, to cure the imbalance in the `sarcasm type' category in MUStARD++, we propose an extension, which we call \\emph{MUStARD++ Balanced}, benchmarking the same with instances from the extension split across both train and test sets, achieving a further 2.4\\% macro-F1 boost.

    "translated_abstract": "MUStARD数据集及其情绪识别扩展MUStARD++的引入，已经确定讽刺是一种多模式现象，不仅通过自然语言文本表达，还通过语言（如音调和语调）和视觉线索（面部表情）表达。通过考虑最先进的语言、语音和视觉编码器，我们旨在对MUStARD++数据集进行严格的基准测试，充分利用其多模式丰富性，使宏观F1值比现有基准提高2％。此外，为了解决MUStARD++中“讽刺类型”类别的不平衡，我们提出了一个名为“MUStARD++ Balanced”的扩展，将此扩展中的实例分布在训练集和测试集中进行基准测试，使宏观F1值进一步提高2.4％。这些新片段来自于一部名为《豪斯医生》的新颖资源，增加了数据集的多样性。",
