    "translated_abstract": "在真实世界的在线网络系统中，多个用户通常按顺序进入系统。对于点击欺诈和虚假评论等应用，某些用户可能恶意执行损坏行为以欺骗系统。因此，设计高效的在线学习算法来从潜在的损坏用户行为中稳健地学习，并在在线方式下准确识别损坏用户是至关重要的。现有的工作提出了对抗性损坏鲁棒的强盗算法。然而，这些算法是为单个用户设计的，不能利用多个用户之间的隐式社会关系进行更高效的学习。此外，它们中没有考虑在多用户情景下如何在线检测损坏用户。在本文中，我们提出了一个重要的在线学习问题，即LOCUD，从被打断的行为中学习并利用未知的用户关系以加快学习，并在在线环境中识别损坏用户。",
