We first formulate a sparsity optimization problem that extracts low-level language features from social media data sources.

    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19大流行加剧了美国各种种族和族裔群体之间的社会经济差距。本研究探讨了社交媒体平台在凸显和解决这些挑战方面的作用。通过分析Twitter上的实时数据，我们研究了与四种主要不良经历相关的语言模式：失业收入损失（LI），食物匮乏（FS），住房不安全（HI）和未满足的心理健康服务需求（UM）。我们首先提出了一个稀疏性优化问题，从社交媒体数据源中提取低级语言特征。其次，我们提出了基于先验知识的语言模式相似性的新约束条件。由于目标函数的非凸性和n个不良经历之间的语言模式相似性关系，该问题很难解决。",
