    "translated_abstract": "关系提取旨在从文本文档中推断结构化的人类知识。基于语言模型的最先进方法通常有两个限制：(1)它们要求命名实体作为输入或推断它们，从而引入了额外的噪声，(2)它们需要人工对文档进行注释。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的基于预训练语言模型的上下文少样本关系抽取框架。据我们所知，我们是第一个将关系抽取任务重新定义为定制的上下文少样本学习范式的研究者。通过这种方式，我们在消除了命名实体识别和文档人工注释的需求的同时，实现了关键性的优势。与现有的基于微调的方法不同，我们的框架具有灵活性，可以在无需重新训练的情况下轻松更新到新的关系集合。我们使用DocRED评估了我们的框架，这是目前最大的公开可用的文档级关系提取数据集。",
