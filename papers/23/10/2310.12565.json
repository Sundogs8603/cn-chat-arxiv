    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在开放世界场景中的终身图学习问题，其中模型需要处理新的任务和潜在的未知类别。我们利用超出分布（OOD）检测方法识别新的类别，并将现有的非图形OOD检测方法适应于图形数据。关键是，我们建议通过将OOD检测方法与从图形邻域聚合的信息相结合，来进行新类别的检测。大多数OOD检测方法都避免确定一个确定的阈值，来决定一个顶点是否为OOD。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种弱监督相关反馈（Open-WRF）方法，降低了OOD检测中对阈值的敏感性。我们在六个基准数据集上评估了我们的方法。我们的结果表明，所提出的邻域聚合方法对OOD得分的表现优于现有方法，而不受基础图神经网络的影响。此外，我们证明了我们的Open-WRF方法对于阈值选择更加鲁棒。",
