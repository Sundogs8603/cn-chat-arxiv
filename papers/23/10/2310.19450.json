    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于边缘集合的2-复形结构（类似于图形，其中边缘可形成三角面）的函数建模的有原则的高斯过程（GPs）。这种方法适用于学习网络上的流动类型数据，其中边缘流可以通过离散的散度和旋度来表征。借鉴Hodge分解，我们首先开发了适用于各种应用的无散度和无旋游的边缘GPs。然后将它们组合起来创建Hodge-组合边缘GPs，这些GPs足够表达任何边缘函数。这些GPs便于对边缘函数的不同Hodge分量进行直接和独立的学习，使我们能够在超参数优化过程中捕捉它们的相关性。为了突显它们的实际潜力，我们将它们应用于货币兑换、海洋流动和供水网络中的流动数据推断，并将其与替代模型进行比较。",
