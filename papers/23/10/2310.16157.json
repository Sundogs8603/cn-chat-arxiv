    "translated_abstract": "特征归因是机器学习和数据分析中的基本任务，涉及确定个别特征或变量对模型输出的贡献。这个过程有助于确定预测结果最重要的特征。特征归因方法的历史可以追溯到广义可加模型 (GAMs)，它通过将因变量和自变量之间的非线性关系纳入模型，扩展了线性回归模型。近年来，基于梯度的方法和替代模型已经被应用于揭示复杂的人工智能 (AI) 系统，但这些方法存在一些局限性。GAMs 往往能够达到较低的准确性，基于梯度的方法很难解释，替代模型通常存在稳定性和保真度问题。此外，大部分现有方法都没有考虑用户的背景，而用户的背景可能会对他们的偏好产生重要影响。为了解决这些限制并推进当前的研究",
