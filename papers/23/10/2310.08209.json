    "translated_abstract": "在流形上进行回归，以及更广泛地说，对流形上的统计学有了重要的关注，因为这种类型的数据有大量的应用。圆形数据是一个经典示例，但协方差矩阵空间上的数据、主成分分析得到的Grassmann流形上的数据等也是如此。在本文中，我们研究了当响应变量$Y$位于流形上，而协变量$X$位于欧几里德空间时，回归场景的预测集。这扩展了[Lei and Wasserman, 2014]中在这一新领域中概述的概念。与一致推断中的传统原则一致，这些预测集是无分布的，表明对$(X, Y)$的联合分布没有施加特定的假设，而且它们保持非参数性质。我们证明了这些区域的经验版本在几乎必然收敛于无穷大时的收敛性。",
