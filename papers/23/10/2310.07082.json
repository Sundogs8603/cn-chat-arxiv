Active and supervised learning is used to learn a surrogate model that predicts the computational performance for a given initialization. We apply this approach to the initialization of Generalized Benders Decomposition for the solution of mixed integer model predictive control problems.

    "translated_abstract": "在过程系统工程任务中，经常需要解决大规模优化问题。分解法是一种常用的解决方法，用于减少计算时间，但其实施具有多个难以配置的步骤。我们提出了一种机器学习方法，学习算法的最佳初始化，以最小化计算时间。采用主动学习和监督学习的方法，学习一个替代模型，预测给定初始化的计算性能。我们将该方法应用于广义Benders分解的初始化，用于解决混合整数模型预测控制问题。替代模型用于寻找应在主问题中添加的初始割的最佳数量。结果表明，所提方法可以显著减少求解时间，主动学习可以减少学习所需的数据量。",

By using active and supervised learning techniques to learn a surrogate model that predicts the computational performance for a given initialization, the proposed method is applied to the initialization of generalized Benders decomposition for solving mixed integer model predictive control problems. Experimental results show a significant reduction in solution time and a decrease in the required amount of data through active learning."
