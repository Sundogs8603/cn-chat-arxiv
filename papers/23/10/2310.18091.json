    "translated_abstract": "在不平衡数据集中进行异常检测是一个频繁且关键的问题，特别是在医疗领域，获取和标记异常通常是昂贵的。将$\\beta$变分自动编码器（VAE）的生成稳定性与生成对抗网络（GAN）的判别能力相结合，我们提出了一种新颖的模型$\\beta$-VAEGAN。我们研究了基于我们模型的判别能力和重构能力的异常分数的组合方法。现有工作集中于线性组合这些组件来确定数据是否异常。我们通过在相应的错误组件上训练核化支持向量机（SVM），进一步改进了现有工作，并考虑了非线性关系。这提高了异常检测性能，同时允许更快的优化。最后，我们利用$\\beta$-VAEGAN对于高斯先验的偏差形成了一个新颖的异常分数组件。与最先进的工作相比，我们改进了异常检测性能。",
