    "abstract": "This work combined different audio features to obtain a more robust fingerprint to be used in a music recommendation process. The combination of these methods resulted in a high-dimensional vector. To reduce the number of values, PCA was applied to the set of resulting fingerprints, selecting the number of principal components that corresponded to an explained variance of $95\\%$. Finally, with these PCA-fingerprints, the similarity matrix of each fingerprint with the entire data set was calculated. The process was applied to 200 songs from a personal music library; the songs were tagged with the artists' corresponding genres. The recommendations (fingerprints of songs with the closest similarity) were rated successful if the recommended songs' genre matched the target songs' genre. With this procedure, it was possible to obtain an accuracy of $89\\%$ (successful recommendations out of total recommendation requests).",

    "translated_abstract": "该研究结合了不同的音频特征，以获得更稳健的指纹来用于音乐推荐的过程中。这些方法的组合导致了一个高维向量。为了减少值的数量，对得到的指纹集合应用了主成分分析(PCA)，选择与解释方差为95%相对应的主成分的数量。最后，使用这些PCA指纹计算了每个指纹与整个数据集的相似矩阵。该过程被应用于个人音乐库中的200首歌曲，这些歌曲被标记了艺术家对应的流派。如果推荐的歌曲的流派与目标歌曲的流派匹配，则被评为成功的推荐(根据指纹的相似度)。通过这个过程，可以获得89%的准确率(成功的推荐占总共的推荐请求)。",
