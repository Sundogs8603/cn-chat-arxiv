    "abstract": "The one of the significant challenges faced by autonomous robotic ultrasound systems is acquiring high-quality images across different patients. The proper orientation of the robotized probe plays a crucial role in governing the quality of ultrasound images. To address this challenge, we propose a sample-efficient method to automatically adjust the orientation of the ultrasound probe normal to the point of contact on the scanning surface, thereby improving the acoustic coupling of the probe and resulting image quality. Our method utilizes Bayesian Optimization (BO) based search on the scanning surface to efficiently search for the normalized probe orientation. We formulate a novel objective function for BO that leverages the contact force measurements and underlying mechanics to identify the normal. We further incorporate a regularization scheme in BO to handle the noisy objective function. The performance of the proposed strategy has been assessed through experiments on urinary bladde",

    "translated_abstract": "自主机器人超声系统面临的一个重要挑战是在不同患者上获取高质量的图像。机器化探头的适当定位对超声图像的质量起着至关重要的作用。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种实现自动调整超声探头与扫描表面的接触点正交的样本高效方法，从而提高超声探头的声学耦合和图像质量。我们的方法利用基于贝叶斯优化的搜索在扫描表面上高效搜索标准化的探头定位。我们为贝叶斯优化制定了一个新颖的目标函数，利用接触力测量和基本力学原理来确定正交方向。我们进一步在贝叶斯优化中引入了正则化方案来处理嘈杂的目标函数。通过对尿膀胱进行实验评估了所提出策略的性能。",
