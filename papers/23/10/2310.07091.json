    "translated_abstract": "基于文档的视觉问答在语言意义消歧和细粒度多模态检索之间提出了一个具有挑战性的任务。虽然由于大规模语言和开放世界先验模型的利用，文档问答取得了鼓舞人心的进展，但仍存在一些挑战，包括响应时间延长、推断持续时间延长和匹配不准确。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出了一种基于连接的多变换器VQA模型Jaegar。为了提取问题特征，我们利用了RoBERTa large和GPT2-xl等预训练模型的强大能力作为特征提取器。随后，我们将两种模型的输出进行连接操作。这个操作使得模型可以同时考虑来自不同来源的信息，增强了其表征能力。通过利用预训练模型进行特征提取，我们的方法有可能增强性能。",
