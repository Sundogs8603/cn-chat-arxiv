    "translated_abstract": "当今很有意义的话题是因果表示学习（Causal Representation Learning，简称CRL），其目标是以数据驱动的方式学习隐藏特征的因果模型。不幸的是，CRL存在严重的不适问题，因为它结合了表示学习和因果发现这两个容易不适问题。然而，要找到能保证唯一解的实际可识别性条件对于其实际应用非常重要。目前大多数方法都基于对潜在因果机制的假设，比如时间因果性、监督或干预的存在；在实际应用中，这些假设可能过于限制性。在这里，我们通过对观测混合表现出合适的变量分组的新型弱约束，展示了可辨识性。我们还提出了一种与模型一致的新型自我监督估计框架。",
