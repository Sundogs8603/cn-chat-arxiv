    "abstract": "The emergence of large-scale pretrained language models has revolutionized the capabilities of new AI application, especially in the realm of crafting chatbots with distinct personas. Given the \"stimulus-response\" nature of chatbots, this paper unveils an innovative open-ended interview-style approach for personality assessment on role-playing chatbots, which offers a richer comprehension of their intrinsic personalities. We conduct personality assessments on 32 role-playing chatbots created by the ChatHaruhi library, across both the Big Five and MBTI dimensions, and measure their alignment with human perception. Evaluation results underscore that modern role-playing chatbots based on LLMs can effectively portray personality traits of corresponding characters, with an alignment rate of 82.8% compared with human-perceived personalities. Besides, we also suggest potential strategies for shaping chatbots' personalities. Hence, this paper serves as a cornerstone study for role-playing chat",

    "translated_abstract": "大规模预训练语言模型的出现彻底改变了新型人工智能应用的能力，尤其是在打造具有独特人物的聊天机器人方面。鉴于聊天机器人的\"刺激-响应\"性质，本文揭示了一种创新的开放式采访式方法，用于评估角色扮演聊天机器人的个性特点，从而更深入地理解其内在个性。我们对ChatHaruhi图书馆创建的32个角色扮演聊天机器人进行了大五人格和MBTI维度上的个性评估，并测量它们与人类感知的一致性。评估结果强调，基于LLMs的现代角色扮演聊天机器人能够有效地描绘出相应角色的个性特点，与人类感知的一致性达到82.8%。此外，我们还提出了塑造聊天机器人个性的潜在策略。因此，本文为角色扮演聊天机器人研究奠定了基础。",
