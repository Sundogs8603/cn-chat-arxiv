Reproducing similar capability in AI agents, we develop a novel learning framework named Communication-Efficient Interactive Learning (CEIL). By equipping a learning agent with an abstract, dynamic language and an intrinsic motivation to learn with minimal communication effort, CEIL leads to emergence of a human-like pattern where the learner and the teacher communicate progressively efficiently by exchanging increasingly more abstract intentions.

    "translated_abstract": "助理 AI 代理应该能够迅速获取新技能并适应用户的新偏好。传统的框架如模仿学习和强化学习不能支持这种能力，因为它们只支持低级、低效的沟通形式。相比之下，人类通过定义和分享抽象意图来实现逐步高效的沟通。为了在 AI 代理中再现类似的能力，我们开发了一种名为沟通高效交互学习（CEIL）的新型学习框架。通过为学习代理提供一个抽象、动态的语言和一种内在的动机，即以尽可能少的沟通代价学习，CEIL 可以导致学习者和教师逐渐高效地交流，通过交换越来越抽象的意图。CEIL 在一个包含长期决策任务的 2D MineCraft 领域上展示了令人印象深刻的性能和沟通效率。",
