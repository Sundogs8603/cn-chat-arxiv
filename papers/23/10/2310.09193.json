    "translated_abstract": "随着区块链在许多行业中的影响逐渐扩大，区块链安全正在变得越来越重要。本文侧重于保护区块链的最底层层级，特别是允许节点进行通信和共享信息的P2P网络。P2P网络层可能容易遭受分布式拒绝服务（DDoS）、日食攻击或Sybil攻击等多种攻击。这一层面易受传统P2P网络中的威胁，因此需要通过收集数据并从网络行为中提取洞察来降低这些风险。我们介绍了Tikuna，这是一种针对以太坊区块链P2P网络进行早期监测和检测潜在攻击的开源工具。Tikuna采用基于循环神经网络（RNN）的无监督长短期记忆（LSTM）方法来检测攻击并警报用户。实证结果表明，所提出的方法显著降低了攻击风险。",
