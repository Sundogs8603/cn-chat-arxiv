    "abstract": "We present a novel system that automatically extracts and generates informative and descriptive sentences from the biomedical corpus and facilitates the efficient search for relational knowledge. Unlike previous search engines or exploration systems that retrieve unconnected passages, our system organizes descriptive sentences as a relational graph, enabling researchers to explore closely related biomedical entities (e.g., diseases treated by a chemical) or indirectly connected entities (e.g., potential drugs for treating a disease). Our system also uses ChatGPT and a fine-tuned relation synthesis model to generate concise and reliable descriptive sentences from retrieved information, reducing the need for extensive human reading effort. With our system, researchers can easily obtain both high-level knowledge and detailed references and interactively steer to the information of interest. We spotlight the application of our system in COVID-19 research, illustrating its utility in areas ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新颖的系统，可以从生物医学文献中自动提取和生成有信息量和描述性的句子，并促进有效的关系知识搜索。与之前检索非相关段落的搜索引擎或探索系统不同，我们的系统将描述性句子组织为一个关系图，使研究人员能够探索相关的生物医学实体（例如，由化学物质治疗的疾病）或间接相关的实体（例如，用于治疗某种疾病的潜在药物）。我们的系统还使用ChatGPT和经过微调的关系合成模型从检索到的信息中生成简洁可靠的描述性句子，减少了人工阅读的需求。使用我们的系统，研究人员可以轻松获得高级知识和详细参考，并可以交互地导航到感兴趣的信息。我们重点介绍了我们系统在COVID-19研究中的应用，以说明其在相关领域的效用",
