In this work, we studied the impact of data augmentation techniques precisely when applied to small imbalanced datasets, for which current state-of-the-art models (such as RoBERTa) under-perform. Specifically, we utilized four data augmentation methods (Easy Data Augmentation EDA, static and contextual Embedding-based, and ProtAugment) on three datasets that come from different sources and vary in size, emotion categories and distributions.

    "translated_abstract": "文本情感识别是自然语言处理中一个具有挑战性的问题，任务是识别出诸如喜悦或愤怒等情感。其中一个挑战是可用的标注了情感的数据集的匮乏。某些现有数据集规模较小，采用不同的情感分类体系，并且情感分布不平衡。在本研究中，我们研究了数据增强技术对小规模不平衡数据集的影响，这些数据集当前的最先进模型（如RoBERTa）性能不佳。具体而言，我们使用了四种数据增强方法（Easy Data Augmentation EDA、基于嵌入的静态和上下文相关、及ProtAugment）在三个源头和不同规模、情感类别及分布的数据集上进行实验。实验结果表明，使用增强后的数据训练分类器模型可以显著提高性能。最后，我们进行了两个案例研究：直接使用增强后的数据进行训练与使用原始数据进行训练的对比，并分析了不同情感类别的影响。",
