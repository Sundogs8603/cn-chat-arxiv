    "abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are of immense interest in applications such as gas storage and carbon capture due to their exceptional porosity and tunable chemistry. Their modular nature has enabled the use of template-based methods to generate hypothetical MOFs by combining molecular building blocks in accordance with known network topologies. However, the ability of these methods to identify top-performing MOFs is often hindered by the limited diversity of the resulting chemical space. In this work, we propose MOFDiff: a coarse-grained (CG) diffusion model that generates CG MOF structures through a denoising diffusion process over the coordinates and identities of the building blocks. The all-atom MOF structure is then determined through a novel assembly algorithm. Equivariant graph neural networks are used for the diffusion model to respect the permutational and roto-translational symmetries. We comprehensively evaluate our model's capability to generate valid and novel MOF struct",

    "translated_abstract": "金属有机骨架 (MOFs) 因其异常多孔性和可调控的化学性质而在气体储存和捕获碳等应用中引起了极大的兴趣。它们的模块化特性使得可以使用基于模板的方法根据已知的网络拓扑结构组合分子构建块来生成假设性的MOFs。然而，这些方法鉴别高性能MOFs的能力常常受到由结果化学空间的有限多样性限制。在这项工作中，我们提出了MOFDiff: 通过对构建块的坐标和标识进行去噪扩散过程生成粗粒度的MOF结构，并通过一种新颖的组装算法确定完整的原子级MOF结构。我们使用等变图神经网络来作为扩散模型，以尊重置换对称性和旋转平移对称性。我们全面评估了我们模型生成有效和新颖MOF结构的能力。",
