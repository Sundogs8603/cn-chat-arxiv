    "abstract": "Telehealth is a valuable tool for primary health care (PHC), where depression is a common condition. PHC is the first point of contact for most people with depression, but about 25% of diagnoses made by PHC physicians are inaccurate. Many other barriers also hinder depression detection and treatment in PHC. Artificial intelligence (AI) may help reduce depression misdiagnosis in PHC and improve overall diagnosis and treatment outcomes. Telehealth consultations often have video issues, such as poor connectivity or dropped calls. Audio-only telehealth is often more practical for lower-income patients who may lack stable internet connections. Thus, our study focused on using audio data to predict depression risk. The objectives were to: 1) Collect audio data from 24 people (12 with depression and 12 without mental health or major health condition diagnoses); 2) Build a machine learning model to predict depression risk. TPOT, an autoML tool, was used to select the best machine learning algo",

    "translated_abstract": "电子健康是初级卫生保健中的有价值工具，抑郁症是常见的病症。初级卫生保健是大多数抑郁症患者的首要联系点，但约有25%的初级卫生保健医生的诊断不准确。许多其他障碍也妨碍了初级卫生保健中的抑郁症检测和治疗。人工智能（AI）可能有助于减少抑郁症在初级卫生保健中的误诊，并改善整体诊断和治疗结果。电子健康咨询常常出现视频问题，如连接不良或通话中断。对于可能缺乏稳定的互联网连接的低收入患者而言，仅音频的电子健康更实用。因此，我们的研究专注于使用音频数据来预测抑郁风险。目标是：1）收集24人的音频数据（12人患有抑郁症，12人没有心理健康或重大健康问题的诊断）；2）构建一个机器学习模型来预测抑郁风险。使用了自动机器学习工具TPOT来选择最佳的机器学习算法。",
