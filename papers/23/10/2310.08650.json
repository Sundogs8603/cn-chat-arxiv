    "translated_abstract": "监控与数据采集系统（SCADA）经常作为电网分站的神经系统。这些系统实现了实时监控、数据采集、设备控制，并确保分站及其连接设备的平稳高效运行。之前的研究已经证明，基于降维的方法，如主成分分析（PCA），可以准确识别SCADA系统中的异常。虽然非负矩阵分解（NMF）并没有专门应用于SCADA，但它在无线传感器网络中检测异常方面表现出了良好的结果。这些无监督方法通过对正常或预期行为进行建模，识别偏离预期行为的事件，从而检测未知类型的攻击或异常。然而，这些方法没有对SCADA系统中自然存在的复杂多维交互进行建模。相比之下，非负张量分解方法能够对SCADA系统进行更准确的建模和异常检测。",
