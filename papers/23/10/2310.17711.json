    "translated_abstract": "随着自然语言处理（NLP）模型的发展，自动生成解释被提议用于解决社交媒体平台上的虚假信息，并向识别到的假新闻添加警告标签。虽然许多研究人员专注于生成良好的解释，但这些解释如何真正帮助人们对抗虚假新闻尚未得到充分探讨。在这项研究中，我们比较了一个警告标签和由GPT-4生成的最先进的反事实解释在揭露虚假信息方面的有效性。通过一个两波次的在线人类实验，研究对象（N = 215）被随机分配到三个组：一个无干预的对照组，在其中展示虚假内容；一个警告标签组，在其中标记虚假声明；以及一个解释组，在其中虚假内容附带GPT-4生成的解释。我们的结果表明，这两种干预都显著降低了参与者对虚假声明的自我报告信任。",
