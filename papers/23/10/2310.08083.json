    "translated_abstract": "管理错误报告中最重要的任务之一是定位故障，以便可以应用修复。因此，先前的工作致力于自动化错误定位任务，将其作为信息检索问题进行建模，通过检索潜在的有错误的文件，并根据其与给定错误报告的文本相似性进行排名。然而，错误报告中包含的信息与源代码文件中的标识符或自然语言之间通常存在明显的语义差距。对于面向用户的软件，目前存在一种关键信息来源，可以帮助错误定位，但尚未得到深入研究，即来自GUI的信息。我们研究了以下假设：对于面向最终用户的应用程序，将错误报告中的信息与GUI中的信息连接起来，并利用这些信息来帮助检索可能有错误的文件，可以改进现有的错误定位技术。为了研究这一现象，我们...（摘要未完，省略）",
