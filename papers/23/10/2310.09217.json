    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个跨国人工智能协会（MAGIC），旨在减轻先进人工智能（AI）对人类存在的风险。MAGIC将成为全球唯一被允许开发先进AI的机构，并通过其签约成员对其他所有先进AI开发实施全球禁令进行强制执行。MAGIC将是一个独家的、注重安全的、高度安全的机构，由成员国共同支持，并以公平分配的原则来获得利益。MAGIC将允许狭义AI模型迅速发展，同时大大减少通用系统中的不匹配、流窜、突破或失控的可能性。我们不讨论实施禁令的政治可行性，也不讨论实施禁止高容量AGI训练的具体立法策略和规则。相反，我们提出了一个积极的未来愿景，即MAGIC作为全球治理机制，可以为长期的发展奠定基础。",
