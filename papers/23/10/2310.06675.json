    "translated_abstract": "混合上下文的问答是一个复杂的任务，需要以各种方式结合从非结构化文本和结构化表中提取的信息。最近，上下文学习在推理任务中取得了显著的性能进步。在这种范式中，一个大型语言模型基于一小组支持示例进行预测。上下文学习的性能在很大程度上取决于支持示例的选择过程，特别是在混合问答的情况下，考虑到推理链的多样性和混合上下文的规模变得至关重要。在这项工作中，我们提出了用于混合推理的示例选择（SEER）的一种新方法，它既具有代表性又具有多样性。SEER的关键创新在于将示例选择形式化为一个背包整数线性规划问题。背包框架提供了灵活性，可以将多样性约束纳入考虑。",
