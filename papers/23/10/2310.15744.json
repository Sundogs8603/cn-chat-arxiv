    "translated_abstract": "单细胞RNA测序(scRNA-seq)是一项相对较新的技术，由于其高维度、复杂性和大规模性，引起了统计学、数据科学和计算生物学领域的巨大兴趣。非负矩阵分解(NMF)因其对结果低维度分量的元基因解释而提供了一种独特的方法。然而，NMF方法在缺乏多尺度分析方面存在问题。该研究引入了两种持久性拉普拉斯正则化NMF方法，即拓扑NMF(TNMF)和鲁棒拓扑NMF(rTNMF)。通过使用共计12个数据集，我们证明了所提出的TNMF和rTNMF显著优于所有其他NMF方法。我们还利用TNMF和rTNMF对流行的UMAP(Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)和t-SNE(t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding)进行了可视化。",
