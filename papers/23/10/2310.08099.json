    "translated_abstract": "气候变化对人类健康的影响带来了前所未有的挑战。除非采取基于确凿证据的积极措施，否则这些威胁很可能会升级，并继续威胁人类福祉。信息和通信技术的不断发展已经促进了社交媒体平台的广泛可用性和利用率。个人利用Twitter和Facebook等平台表达自己对各种主题的意见、想法和评论，包括紧迫的气候变化问题。社交媒体上与气候变化相关内容的激增需要进行全面分析以获得有意义的洞察。本论文利用自然语言处理技术分析气候变化话语，并量化与气候变化相关的推文的情感。我们使用ClimateBERT，这是一个专门针对气候变化领域进行了微调的预训练模型。目标是识别情感态度。",
    "tldr": "本研究利用自然语言处理分析社交媒体上关于气候变化的推文情感态度，通过使用ClimateBERT模型量化情感，从而获得有关公众对气候变化的观点和反馈。",
