    "abstract": "Several individualization methods have recently been proposed to estimate a subject's Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) using convenient input modalities such as anthropometric measurements or pinnae photographs. There exists a need for adaptively correcting the estimation error committed by such methods using a few data point samples from the subject's HRTF, acquired using acoustic measurements or perceptual feedback. To this end, we introduce a Convolutional Conditional Neural Process meta-learner specialized in HRTF error interpolation. In particular, the model includes a Spherical Convolutional Neural Network component to accommodate the spherical geometry of HRTF data. It also exploits potential symmetries between the HRTF's left and right channels about the median axis.

    "translated_abstract": "最近提出了几种个性化方法来估计主观头相关传递函数（HRTF），使用便捷的输入模态，例如人类测量或耳廓照片。然而，这些方法在使用一些由声学测量或感知反馈获得的主观HRTF数据点样本时，存在纠正估计误差的需求。为此，我们引入了一种专门用于HRTF误差插值的卷积条件神经过程元学习器。特别地，该模型包括一个球形卷积神经网络组件，以适应HRTF数据的球形几何特性。它还利用了HRTF左右声道在中轴线上的潜在对称性。在这项工作中，我们在一个简化的设置下，纯粹从时间对齐的频谱插值角度评估了所提出模型的性能，其中通用的人群平均HRTF形成了初始估计。",
