    "translated_abstract": "双边贸易涉及在两个战略代理人之间促进交易的挑战，一个是卖家，一个是买家，两者都对物品有私人估值。我们研究了该问题的在线版本，在每个时间步长，都会出现一个新的卖家和买家。学习者的任务是在不了解他们估值的情况下为每个代理人设置价格。卖家和买家的序列由一个遗忘性对手选择。在这个设置下，已知的负面结果排除了在每次迭代中学习者必须保证预算平衡的可能性。在本文中，我们引入了全局预算平衡的概念，该概念仅要求代理人在整个时间范围内保持预算平衡。通过要求全局预算平衡，我们提供了首个针对具有对抗输入的双边贸易的无悔算法，并在不同的反馈模型下进行了验证。首先，我们证明在全反馈模型中，学习者可以实现最小遗憾。",
