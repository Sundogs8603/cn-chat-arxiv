    "translated_abstract": "在1976年，Lai构造了一个非平凡的均值$\\mu$的高斯分布的置信序列，该分布的方差$\\sigma$是未知的。他使用了关于$\\sigma$的不适当（右Haar）混合和关于$\\mu$的不适当（平坦）混合。在本文中，我们详细说明了他构建的细节，其中使用了广义的不可积分鞅和扩展的维尔不等式。尽管这确实产生了一个顺序T检验，但由于他的鞅不可积分，它并没有产生一个“e-process”。在本文中，我们为相同的设置开发了两个新的“e-process”和置信序列：一个是在缩减滤波器中的测试鞅，另一个是在规范数据滤波器中的“e-process”。这些分别是通过将Lai的平坦混合替换为高斯混合，并将对$\\sigma$的右Haar混合替换为在零空间下的最大似然估计，就像在通用推断中一样。我们还分析了所得结果的宽度。",
