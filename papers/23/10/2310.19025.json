    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种面向Oracle高效的放松方法，用于处理对抗性上下文赌博问题，其中上下文是从已知分布中顺序独立抽取的，而成本序列则由在线对手选择。我们的算法具有一个$O(T^{\\frac{2}{3}}(K\\log(|\\Pi|))^{\\frac{1}{3}})$的遗憾界限，并且每轮最多调用$O(K)$次离线优化Oracle，其中$K$表示动作的数量，$T$表示轮数，$\\Pi$表示策略集。这是第一个改进Syrgkanis等人在NeurIPS 2016中获得的$O((TK)^{\\frac{2}{3}}(\\log(|\\Pi|))^{\\frac{1}{3}})$界限的结果，并且也是与Langford和Zhang在NeurIPS 2007中为随机情况提出的原始界限相匹配的结果。",
