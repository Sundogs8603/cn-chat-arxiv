    "translated_abstract": "有向无环图(DAG)被广泛用于表示一组收集到的节点之间的方向关系。然而，一次单独研究中可用的数据往往有限，不足以准确地重构DAG，而异构数据可能会从多个相关研究中收集到。如何将异构数据汇集到目标研究中以更好地重构DAG结构仍然是一个未解决的问题。在本文中，我们首先引入了一套新颖的DAG结构相似度度量，然后提出了一个传输DAG学习框架，通过有效地利用不同相似性水平的辅助DAG的信息来提高目标研究中的DAG重构效果。我们的理论分析表明，在目标DAG没有整体与辅助DAG相似的情况下，我们的方法也能在DAG重构方面实现显著的改进，这与大多数现有的传输学习方法形成鲜明对比。我们的实验结果也支持了所提出的传输DAG学习的优势。",
