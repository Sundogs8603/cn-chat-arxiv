    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言处理领域中，为解决数据不平衡问题，文本数据增强方法已成为关键性解决方案。在资金申请过程中提交的研究提案中存在这种数据不平衡问题。这种不平衡由学科的受欢迎程度或跨学科研究的出现引起，严重影响了能够推断出这些提案所属学科的下游主题模型的准确性。在数据层面上，由专家和科学家撰写的提案本质上是复杂的技术文本，充斥着复杂的术语，因此增强这种专业文本数据带来了独特的挑战。在系统层面上，这反过来损害了AI辅助评审员分配系统的公平性，从而引发了解决这个问题的关注点。本研究利用大型语言模型（Llama V1）作为数据生成器来增强分类在复杂学科分类中的研究提案。",
