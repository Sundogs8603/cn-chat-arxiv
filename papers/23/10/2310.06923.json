    "translated_abstract": "在深度学习和物理信息学习中，标准的不确定性量化方法存在着持久的局限性。特别是，需要对数据的可能性做出强烈的假设，性能在很大程度上取决于先验的选择，并且后验只能以近似的方式进行采样，从而由于相关的计算成本导致近似精度较差。本文提出并研究了对确定性偏微分方程的置信区间（CI）估计作为一个新的问题。即，在整个区域中以概率担保的形式传播置信度，以达到数据位置到整个域的置信度传播。我们提出了一种名为物理信息置信传播（PICProp）的方法，基于双层优化来计算一个有效的CI，而不需要进行大量的假设。我们提供了关于我们方法有效性的定理以及针对物理信息学习的计算实验。",
