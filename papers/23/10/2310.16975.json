    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了两种神经网络方法，分别逼近静态和动态条件最优传输问题的解。这两种方法可以对条件概率分布进行采样和密度估计，这是贝叶斯推断中的核心任务。我们的方法将目标条件分布表示为可处理的参考分布的转换，因此属于测度传输的框架。在该框架中，COT映射是一个典型的选择，具有唯一性和单调性等可取的属性。然而，相关的COT问题在中等维度下计算具有挑战性。为了提高可扩展性，我们的数值算法利用神经网络对COT映射进行参数化。我们的方法充分利用了COT问题的静态和动态表达形式的结构。PCP-Map将条件传输映射建模为部分输入凸神经网络（PICNN）的梯度。",
