Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in addressing this challenge, with sampling-based and regression-based methods emerging as two prominent approaches. However, these methods have notable limitations. Sampling-based methods often suffer from low efficiency due to the need for generating multiple candidate structures for selection.

    "translated_abstract": "在药物发现中，对蛋白质和配体之间的相互作用进行建模并准确预测其结合结构是一项关键但具有挑战性的任务。深度学习的最新进展在应对这一挑战方面显示出了希望，采样法和回归法成为两种突出的方法。然而，这些方法都存在明显的局限性。采样法通常由于需要生成多个候选结构来进行选择而效率较低。而回归法提供了快速的预测，但可能会导致准确性降低。另外，蛋白质大小的变化通常需要外部模块来选择合适的结合口袋，进一步影响效率。在这项工作中，我们提出了FABind，一个将口袋预测和对接相结合的端到端模型，以实现准确和快速的蛋白-配体结合。",
