    "abstract": "Modern multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems like Whisper have made it possible to transcribe audio in multiple languages with a single model. However, current state-of-the-art ASR models are typically evaluated on individual languages or in a multi-task setting, overlooking the challenge of continually learning new languages. There is insufficient research on how to add new languages without losing valuable information from previous data. Furthermore, existing continual learning benchmarks focus mostly on vision and language tasks, leaving continual learning for multilingual ASR largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose CL-MASR, a benchmark designed for studying multilingual ASR in a continual learning setting. CL-MASR provides a diverse set of continual learning methods implemented on top of large-scale pretrained ASR models, along with common metrics to assess the effectiveness of learning new languages while addressing the issue of catastrophic forgetting",

    "translated_abstract": "现代多语音自动语音识别（ASR）系统，如Whisper，使得能够使用单个模型转录多种语言的音频成为可能。然而，当前最先进的ASR模型通常在单个语言或多任务设置下进行评估，忽视了持续学习新语言的挑战。关于如何添加新语言而不丢失先前数据中有价值信息的研究不足。此外，现有的持续学习基准主要集中在视觉和语言任务上，对于多语音ASR的持续学习还未深入探索。为了填补这一空白，我们提出CL-MASR，一个专为在持续学习环境中研究多语音ASR而设计的基准。CL-MASR提供了一系列多样化的持续学习方法，基于大规模预训练的ASR模型实现，并提供常见的指标来评估学习新语言的效果，同时解决了灾难性遗忘问题。",
