    "abstract": "This work introduces a robotics platform which embeds a conversational AI agent in an embodied system for natural language understanding and intelligent decision-making for service tasks; integrating task planning and human-like conversation. The agent is derived from a large language model, which has learned from a vast corpus of general knowledge. In addition to generating dialogue, this agent can interface with the physical world by invoking commands on the robot; seamlessly merging communication and behavior. This system is demonstrated in a free-form tour-guide scenario, in an HRI study combining robots with and without conversational AI capabilities. Performance is measured along five dimensions: overall effectiveness, exploration abilities, scrutinization abilities, receptiveness to personification, and adaptability.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究介绍了一种机器人平台，将会话型人工智能代理嵌入到具有自然语言理解和智能决策功能的具身系统中，以实现服务任务的任务规划和类人对话的一体化。该代理基于一个大型语言模型，通过学习广泛的通用知识而得到。除了生成对话，该代理还可以通过在机器人上调用命令与物理世界进行交互，实现通信与行为的无缝融合。该系统在一个自由形式的导游场景中进行了演示，结合机器人以及不具备会话型人工智能能力的机器人进行了HRI研究。通过五个维度来衡量性能：整体有效性，探索能力，审查能力，对人格化的接受度和适应性。",
