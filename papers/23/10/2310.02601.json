    "translated_abstract": "最近扩散模型的进展显著提高了具有2D控制的数据合成。然而，在街景生成中精确的三维控制在三维感知任务中至关重要，但仍然难以实现。具体来说，使用鸟瞰图作为主要条件常常导致几何控制（如高度）方面的挑战，影响物体形状、遮挡模式和道路表面高程等对感知数据合成至关重要的因素，特别是对于三维物体检测任务而言。在本文中，我们介绍了MagicDrive，这是一个新颖的街景生成框架，提供了多样化的三维几何控制，包括相机姿态、道路地图和三维边界框，以及通过定制的编码策略实现的文本描述。此外，我们的设计还采用了跨视图注意力模块，确保多个相机视图之间的一致性。通过MagicDrive，我们实现了高保真度的街景合成，捕捉到了精细的三维几何信息。",
