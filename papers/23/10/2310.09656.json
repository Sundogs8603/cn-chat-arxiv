    "translated_abstract": "最近在表格数据生成领域的进展极大地提高了合成数据的质量。然而，由于表格数据的复杂多样的分布和融合的数据类型，将扩散模型扩展到表格数据是具有挑战性的。本文介绍了Tabsyn，一种利用潜在空间中的扩散模型和变分自编码器（VAE）生成表格数据的方法。所提出的Tabsyn的主要优势包括：（1）通用性：能够处理各种数据类型，并将其转换为单一的统一空间，并明确捕捉列间关系；（2）质量：通过优化潜在嵌入的分布以增强后续扩散模型的训练，从而生成高质量的合成数据；（3）速度：比现有的基于扩散的方法具有更少的反向步骤和更快的生成速度。对于六个数据集的大量实验证明，Tabsyn优于现有的方法。",
