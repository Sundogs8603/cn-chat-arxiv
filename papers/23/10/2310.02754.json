    "translated_abstract": "在数字时代，能够阅读和理解书面文本是至关重要的。然而，研究表明，大部分人口都存在理解障碍。在这种背景下，需要进一步的无障碍倡议来提高受众的文本理解能力。然而，作家们几乎没有得到支持或鼓励以创作易于理解的内容。此外，自动文本简化（ATS）模型的开发缺乏准确估计理解难度的度量标准。我们提出了\\textsc{LC-Score}，一种简单的方法来训练文本理解度量标准，用于法语文本而无需参考，即预测给定文本在$[0, 100]$范围内的易读程度。我们的目标是定量捕捉文本符合\\textit{Langage Clair}（LC，即\\textit{Clear Language}）指南的程度，该指南与英语简明语言密切相关。我们探索了两种方法：（i）使用语言学方法",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a simple approach called LC-Score for estimating text comprehension difficulty without reference. It can be used for French text and predicts the readability of a given text on a scale from 0 to 100. The method aims to assist writers in producing easy-to-understand content and provide a metric for evaluating the development of automatic text simplification models."
