In this work, we explore how to enable users to interactively refine model outputs through their feedback, by helping them convert their feedback into a set of principles (i.e. a constitution) that dictate the model's behavior. From a formative study, we (1) found that users needed support converting their feedback into principles for the chatbot and (2) classified the different principle types desired by users.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）提示是一种让用户创建和定制自己的聊天机器人的新方法。然而，目前的引导聊天机器人输出的方法，如提示工程和微调，不支持用户将对模型输出的自然反馈转换为提示或模型的变化。在这项工作中，我们探讨了如何通过帮助用户将他们的反馈转化为一组原则（即宪法）来使用户能够通过反馈与改进模型输出进行交互。从一项形成性研究中，我们发现（1）用户需要支持将他们的反馈转化为聊天机器人的原则，并且（2）对用户所需的不同原则类型进行了分类。受到这些发现的启发，我们开发了ConstitutionMaker，这是一个将用户反馈转化为原则的交互式工具，用于引导基于LLM的聊天机器人。",
