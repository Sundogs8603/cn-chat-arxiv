    "abstract": "The identification and classification of political claims is an important step in the analysis of political newspaper reports; however, resources for this task are few and far between. This paper explores different strategies for the cross-lingual projection of political claims analysis. We conduct experiments on a German dataset, DebateNet2.0, covering the policy debate sparked by the 2015 refugee crisis. Our evaluation involves two tasks (claim identification and categorization), three languages (German, English, and French) and two methods (machine translation -- the best method in our experiments -- and multilingual embeddings).",
