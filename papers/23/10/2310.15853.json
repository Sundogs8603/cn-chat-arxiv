    "translated_abstract": "最近发展起来的生存分析方法通过预测在一些预先指定的（离散的）时间间隔内事件发生的概率来改进现有方法。通过避免对事件密度施加强烈的参数假设，这种方法在数据丰富的情况下往往能够提高预测性能。然而，在临床环境中，由于可用数据有限，通常更喜欢将事件时间空间划分为少量适合手头预测任务的时间间隔。在这项工作中，我们开发了一种从数据中学习划分定义的切点集合的方法。我们展示在两个模拟数据集中，我们能够恢复与基础生成模型相匹配的时间间隔。然后，我们在三个真实的观察性数据集中展示了改进的预测性能，其中包括一个大型的、新调和的中风风险预测数据集。最后，我们认为我们的方法有助于临床。",
