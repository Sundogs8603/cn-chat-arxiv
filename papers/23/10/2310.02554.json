    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是一种机器学习范式，使多个分散的客户端在中央协调者的组织下共同训练一个模型。传统的联邦学习解决方案依赖于对中央协调者的信任，它以公平诚实的方式形成客户端的群体。然而，在现实中，恶意的协调者可能会放弃并替换客户端的训练模型，或者发动虚假客户端的肆意攻击。这种恶意行为让协调者在联邦学习环境中拥有更多控制客户端和决定最终训练结果的权力。本文介绍了zkFL，它利用零知识证明(ZKPs)来解决训练模型聚合过程中的恶意协调者问题。为了保证正确的聚合结果，协调者需要每轮提供一个证明。这个证明可以向客户端证明协调者忠实执行预期行为。为了进一步保护客户端隐私和数据安全，我们还引入了差分隐私机制，并对zkFL进行了实验评估。",
