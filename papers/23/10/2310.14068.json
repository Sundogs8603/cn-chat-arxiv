Key features of GFE are preserved, such as individuals belonging to one of a finite number of groups and group membership is unrestricted and estimated. Ignoring group heteroskedasticity may lead to poor classification, which is detrimental to finite sample bias and standard errors of estimators. I introduce the \"weighted grouped fixed effects\" (WGFE) estimator that minimizes a weighted average of group sum of squared residuals. I establish $\\sqrt{NT}$-consistency and normality under a concept of group separation based on second moments. A test of group homoskedasticity is discussed. A fast computation procedure is provided. Simulations show that WGFE outperforms alternatives that exclude second moment information. I demonstrate this approach by considering the link between income and democracy and the effect of unionization on earnings.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文将线性分组固定效应（GFE）面板模型扩展为允许来自离散潜在组别变量的异方差。GFE的关键特征得以保留，如个体属于有限数量的组别之一，组别成员资格是不受限制的并且可以估计。忽略组别异方差可能导致分类不准确，这对有限样本偏误和估计量的标准误差是有害的。我介绍了“加权分组固定效应”（WGFE）估计器，它最小化了组别平方残差的加权平均值。我在基于二阶矩的组别分离概念下建立了$\\sqrt{NT}$-一致性和正态性。讨论了组别同方差的检验。提供了一种快速的计算过程。模拟结果表明，WGFE优于排除二阶矩信息的替代方法。我通过考虑收入与民主之间的联系以及工会化对收入的影响来展示这种方法。",
