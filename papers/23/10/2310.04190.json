    "translated_abstract": "消息传递的图神经网络通过聚合来自所有邻居节点的消息来迭代计算节点嵌入。这个过程可以被视为Weisfeiler-Leman方法的神经变体，这限制了它们的表达能力。此外，过度平滑和过度压缩限制了这些网络能够有效利用的层数。消息传递中相同信息的重复交换和编码会放大过度压缩。我们提出了一种基于邻域树的新的聚合方案，允许通过修剪标准消息传递中的展开树的分支来控制冗余。我们证明减少冗余可以提高表达能力，并通过实验证明它减轻了过度压缩。我们研究了消息传递中的冗余与计算中的冗余之间的相互作用，并提出了邻域树的紧凑表示，通过神经树规范化技术计算节点和图的嵌入。",
