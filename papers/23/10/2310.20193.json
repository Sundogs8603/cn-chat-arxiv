    "translated_abstract": "在推荐系统中，保护隐私和降低边缘用户的通信成本是一个重要的挑战。尽管联邦学习在避免客户端和服务器之间的数据交换方面被证明是有效的，但研究表明，服务器可以根据两轮用户上传的梯度的非零梯度变化来推断用户的评分。此外，联邦推荐系统面临异质性问题，导致推荐性能下降。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为FedRec+的联邦推荐系统的集成框架，旨在增强隐私性并解决异质性问题。FedRec+利用基于特征相似性的最优子集选择来生成伪项目的近似最佳虚拟评分，仅利用用户的本地信息。这种方法可以减少噪声而不增加额外的通信成本。此外，我们利用Wasserstein距离来估计异质性问题。",
