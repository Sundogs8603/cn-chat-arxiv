    "translated_abstract": "生成割平面的线性规划（CGLP）在产生混合整数规划的可行区域的有效不等式时起着关键作用。当将其插入分支界限算法中时，从CGLP获得的割平面有助于加紧松弛并改进对偶下界。然而，由于节点候选数目庞大且缺乏关于哪些节点可生成有效割平面的先验知识，在分支界限树的节点上运行CGLP在计算上是困难的。因此，尽管CGLP对改进对偶下界有潜在影响，但在默认设置的分支割算法中经常避免使用。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于机器学习的新框架，用于近似确定一个CGLP类的最优值，以确定一个割平面是否可以在分支界限树的节点上生成。我们将CGLP转化为目标向量的指示函数，并展示了它可以通过合作伙伴来近似。",
