CPLCS comprises:(1) PL-NL contrastive learning, which learns the semantic matching relationship between PL and NL representations; (2) a prompt learning design for a dual-encoder structure that can alleviate the problem of inadequate semantic representation; (3) a cross-modal interaction mechanism to enhance the fine-grained mapping between NL and PL.

    "translated_abstract": "代码搜索旨在检索与自然语言描述高度匹配的代码片段。最近，许多代码预训练方法在代码搜索方面表现出令人印象深刻的性能。然而，现有的代码搜索方法仍然受到两个性能限制的困扰：语义表示不足和自然语言与编程语言之间的语义鸿沟。在本文中，我们提出了基于对比提示学习的代码搜索方法CPLCS，该方法基于跨模态交互机制。CPLCS包括：（1）编程语言-自然语言对比学习，学习编程语言和自然语言表示之间的语义匹配关系；（2）双编码器结构的提示学习设计，可以缓解语义表示不足的问题；（3）跨模态交互机制，增强自然语言和编程语言之间的细粒度映射。我们进行了大量实验证明了我们方法的有效性。",
