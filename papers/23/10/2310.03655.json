    "translated_abstract": "算法在形式上和量化中模糊概念（如价值）的度量中得到了广泛的应用，以做出决策。当人们为了获得有利的决策结果而对这些评估作出战略性回应时，他们的行为可能受到道德判断。他们可能被描述为“操纵系统”或“作弊”，或者（在其他情况下）投入“诚实努力”或“改进”。机器学习文献对战略行为进行了描述，强调了决策对象为获得更有利评估所付出的努力——一些作品提供了预防或阻止这种操纵的方法，一些区分了“操纵”和“改进”行为，而另一些旨在测量分类系统的努力负担或不平等效果。我们从一个不同的出发点开始：评估设计本身就可以被理解为评估者所追求的目标，这些目标可能与社会的目标不一致。",
    "tldr": "本论文以评估设计作为出发点，研究了在形式和量化评估中的战略行为以及评估者和被评估对象之间的道德判断关系。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper examines the strategic behavior in formal and quantitative evaluations and explores the moral judgments between evaluators and subjects, with a focus on the design of evaluation itself."
