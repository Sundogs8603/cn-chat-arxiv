    "translated_abstract": "深度学习方法用于解决高维回溯随机微分方程的数值方案近年来引起了许多科学兴趣。虽然它们能够近似计算非常高维的回溯随机微分方程，但其可靠性尚未被研究和理解。在这项工作中，我们研究了一类基于深度学习的回溯随机微分方程方案的不确定性量化。具体而言，我们回顾了方案中涉及的不确定性来源，并通过数值方法研究了不同来源的影响。通常，通过对使用不同数据集多次运行算法得到的近似解的标准差（STD）进行计算来解决不确定性。这种方法在高维问题上计算成本相当昂贵。因此，我们开发了一个UQ模型，它能够仅使用一次算法运行来高效地估计近似解的标准差。该模型还能够估计近似解的平均值。",
