    "translated_abstract": "自从ChatGPT成为一种重要的AI生成文本模型以来，它在各种应用中（包括软件开发和维护）提供高质量的回应，吸引了许多人的兴趣。ChatGPT有很大的潜力，但其误用可能会带来严重问题，特别是在教育和公共安全领域。目前已经有几种AI生成文本检测工具可供使用，但它们都是在真实文本上进行测试的。然而，需要进一步研究它们对多领域ChatGPT材料的有效性。本研究旨在通过创建一个多领域数据集来测试用于检测大学和其他研究机构使用的最先进API和工具的能力。为此，创建了一个包含文章、摘要、故事、新闻和产品评论的大型数据集。第二步是使用新创建的数据集来测试六种工具的性能。",
