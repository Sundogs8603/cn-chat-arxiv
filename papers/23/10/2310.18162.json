    "abstract": "We study the proportional clustering problem of Chen et al. [ICML'19] and relate it to the area of multiwinner voting in computational social choice. We show that any clustering satisfying a weak proportionality notion of Brill and Peters [EC'23] simultaneously obtains the best known approximations to the proportional fairness notion of Chen et al. [ICML'19], but also to individual fairness [Jung et al., FORC'20] and the \"core\" [Li et al. ICML'21]. In fact, we show that any approximation to proportional fairness is also an approximation to individual fairness and vice versa. Finally, we also study stronger notions of proportional representation, in which deviations do not only happen to single, but multiple candidate centers, and show that stronger proportionality notions of Brill and Peters [EC'23] imply approximations to these stronger guarantees.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了Chen等人的比例聚类问题，并将其与计算社会选择中的多赢家投票领域相关联。我们展示了满足Brill和Peters的弱比例概念的任何聚类同时获得了Chen等人的比例公平性的最佳近似，也获得了个体公平性和“核心”的最佳近似。事实上，我们表明任何对比例公平性的近似也是对个体公平性的近似，反之亦然。最后，我们还研究了更强的比例代表性概念，其中偏差不仅发生在单个候选中心，而是多个候选中心，并展示了Brill和Peters的更强比例概念暗示了这些更强保证的近似。",
