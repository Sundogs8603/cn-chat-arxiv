    "translated_abstract": "本研究通过使用游戏式界面作为选择架构，调查了损失框架和个体风险态度对购买保险产品的意愿的影响。该应用程序将真实生活中的事件呈现出来。无论是财务损失框架事件还是情感损失框架事件之后都有购买保险的选择。研究对象包括本科生和年长参与者，后者根据收入和教育程度进一步细分。研究结果表明，损失框架对保险消费的影响在年轻人群体中更高，尽管这取决于保险产品类型。健康和意外保险与年轻参与者的风险态度呈负相关，而意外保险与年长参与者呈正相关。风险态度和人寿保险产品之间没有依赖关系。这些发现阐明了年龄、收入、家庭责任和风险态度的作用。",

The findings show that loss-framing has a greater effect on insurance consumption in younger population and that risk attitudes are correlated with the types of insurance products."
