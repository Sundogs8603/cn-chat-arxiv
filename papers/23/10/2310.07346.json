    "abstract": "The German Information Retrieval community is located in two different sub-fields: Information and computer science. There are no current studies that investigate these communities on a scientometric level. Available studies only focus on the information scientific part of the community. We generated a data set of 401 recent IR-related publications extracted from six core IR conferences from a mainly computer scientific background. We analyze this data set at the institutional and researcher level. The data set is publicly released, and we also demonstrate a mapping use case.",
