    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了设计一种适用于具有强聚类特性的图的亚线性时间谱聚类预测器的问题。这样的图包含k个潜在聚类，每个聚类的内导纳较大（至少为φ），外导纳较小（最多为ε）。我们的目标是对图进行预处理，以使得聚类成员查询能够在亚线性时间内进行，并且所得到的分区应与接近真实聚类的k-分区一致。之前的预测器要么依赖于内外导纳之间有一个poly(k)log n的差距，要么需要指数级（在k/ε上）的预处理时间。我们的算法放宽了这些假设，尽管会略微增加错误分类率。我们还展示了我们的聚类预测器对于少量的随机边删除是鲁棒的。为了验证我们的理论界限，我们进行了实验。",
