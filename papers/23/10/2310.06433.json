    "translated_abstract": "测试Oracle作为一个评估软件输出和给定输入集的预期行为之间对应关系的标准或机制。在自动化测试中，黑盒技术被广泛使用，其中包括差分测试和变异测试等著名方法，以其非侵入性的测试Oracle构建方式而闻名。受到数学概念的启发，我们提出了逆向测试，一种新颖的黑盒测试方法。它利用辅助程序与被测试程序结合，建立了由前向程序和后向程序组成的双程序结构。输入数据首先由前向程序处理，然后使用后向程序将其程序输出反转为其原始输入格式。特别地，辅助程序可以作为前向程序或后向程序运行，从而导致不同的测试模式。该过程通过检查这两个程序之间的关系来进行测试。",
