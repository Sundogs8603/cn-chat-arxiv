    "translated_abstract": "有效的带外分布检测对于可靠的机器学习模型至关重要，然而大多数当前方法由于需要访问训练数据或者干预训练而在实际应用中受到限制。我们提出了一种新的方法，通过网络中间层的变换平滑性来检测深度神经网络中的带外数据（BLOOD），该方法适用于没有训练数据访问权限的预训练模型。BLOOD利用内分布（ID）数据的层间表示变换相较于带外数据的变换更平滑的倾向，这也是我们在Transformer网络中经验证明的一个特性。我们在几个文本分类任务上评估了BLOOD与Transformer网络，并证明其在资源需求相当的方法上性能更好。我们的分析还表明，当学习更简单的任务时，带外数据的变换会保持其原始的锐度，而锐度会随着任务的增加而增加。",
