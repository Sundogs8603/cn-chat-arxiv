    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel memory-efficient recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture specified to solve the object localization problem. This problem is to recover the object states along with its movement in a noisy environment. We take the idea of the classical particle filter and combine it with GRU RNN architecture. The key feature of the resulting memory-efficient particle filter RNN model (mePFRNN) is that it requires the same number of parameters to process environments of different sizes. Thus, the proposed mePFRNN architecture consumes less memory to store parameters compared to the previously proposed PFRNN model. To demonstrate the performance of our model, we test it on symmetric and noisy environments that are incredibly challenging for filtering algorithms. In our experiments, the mePFRNN model provides more precise localization than the considered competitors and requires fewer trained parameters.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种新颖的内存高效递归神经网络（RNN）架构，专门用于解决物体定位问题。该问题是在嘈杂的环境中恢复物体状态及其移动轨迹。我们将经典粒子滤波的思想与GRU RNN架构相结合。得到的内存高效粒子滤波RNN模型（mePFRNN）的关键特点是，它在处理不同大小的环境时需要相同数量的参数。因此，与以前提出的PFRNN模型相比，所提出的mePFRNN架构需要更少的存储参数内存。为了证明我们模型的性能，我们将其应用到对于滤波算法而言极具挑战性的对称嘈杂环境中。在我们的实验中，mePFRNN模型提供比其他竞争模型更精确的定位结果，并且需要更少的训练参数。",
