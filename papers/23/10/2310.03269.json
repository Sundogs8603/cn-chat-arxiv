To address this challenge, we propose InstructProtein, an innovative LLM that possesses bidirectional generation capabilities in both human and protein languages: (i) taking a protein sequence as input to predict its textual function description and (ii) using natural language to prompt protein sequence generation. To achieve this, we first pre-train an LLM on both protein and natural language corpora, enabling it to comprehend individual languages. Then supervised instruction tuning is employed to facilitate the alignment of these two distinct languages. Herein, we introduce a knowledge graph-based instruction generation framework to construct a high-quality instruction dataset, addressing annotation imbalance and instruction deficits in existing protein-text corpus.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）在自然语言处理领域取得了革命性的进展，但在理解蛋白质等生物序列方面仍有不足之处。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了InstructProtein，这是一个创新的LLM，具备人类和蛋白质语言的双向生成能力：（i）以蛋白质序列为输入，预测其文本功能描述；（ii）使用自然语言提示蛋白质序列的生成。为了实现这一目标，我们首先对蛋白质和自然语言语料进行预训练，使其能够理解这两种语言。然后采用监督指导调整的方式，促进这两种不同语言的对齐。在此基础上，我们引入了基于知识图谱的指导生成框架，构建了一个高质量的指导数据集，解决了现有蛋白质-文本语料中的标注不平衡和指导缺失问题。具体而言，这些指导继承了蛋白质的结构特征。",
