    "translated_abstract": "手动创造和评估游戏是一项艰巨而费时的任务。程序生成内容可以通过创建游戏元素来提供帮助，但通常不能生成完整的游戏。进化游戏设计将进化算法与自动化测试相结合，已用于创建具备简单设备的新颖桌面游戏；然而，原有方法并不包括带有骰子、卡牌和地图等复杂桌面游戏。本研究提出了将该方法扩展到桌面游戏的方式，并通过生成《风险》这款军事策略游戏的变体来评估该过程。我们使用遗传算法进化所选参数，并利用规则中心代理测试游戏，并使用多个质量标准评估生成的新变体。结果显示我们创造了原始游戏的新变体，这些变体具有较小的地图，导致比赛时间更短。此外，这些变体产生了更加平衡的比赛。",
