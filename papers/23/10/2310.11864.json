    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了VQ-NeRF，这是一个具有向量量化（VQ）的双分支神经网络模型，用于对3D场景中的反射场进行分解和编辑。传统的神经反射场仅使用连续表示来建模3D场景，尽管现实中的物体通常由离散材料组成。这种缺乏离散化可能导致材料分解噪声和复杂的材料编辑。为了解决这些限制，我们的模型包括一个连续分支和一个离散分支。连续分支按照传统流程预测分解的材料，而离散分支使用VQ机制将连续材料量化为单独的材料。通过离散化材料，我们的模型可以减少分解过程中的噪声，并生成离散材料的分割地图。可以通过点击分割结果的相应区域来轻松选择特定材料进行进一步编辑。",
