    "translated_abstract": "识别类比在人类认知和语言能力中起着重要作用。在过去的十年里，对于“A对B就像C对D”这种形式的词语类比进行了广泛的研究。然而，对于涉及更长文本的类比，如句子和句子集合，传达类比意义的问题引起了越来越多的兴趣。当前的自然语言处理研究社区评估大型语言模型（LLMs）识别此类类比的能力，但这些能力背后的原因需要进一步探究。此外，LLMs在其嵌入中编码语言的句法和语义结构的能力，近年来得到了显著关注。在这项工作中，我们研究了多个LLMs识别句子类比的能力与其编码句法和语义结构的能力之间的关系。通过分析，我们发现LLMs的类比识别能力与其编码能力有关。",
