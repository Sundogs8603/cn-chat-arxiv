    "abstract": "Although pervasive spread of misinformation on social media platforms has become a pressing challenge, existing platform interventions have shown limited success in curbing its dissemination. In this study, we propose a stance-aware graph neural network (stance-aware GNN) that leverages users' stances to proactively predict misinformation spread. As different user stances can form unique echo chambers, we customize four information passing paths in stance-aware GNN, while the trainable attention weights provide explainability by highlighting each structure's importance. Evaluated on a real-world dataset, stance-aware GNN outperforms benchmarks by 32.65% and exceeds advanced GNNs without user stance by over 4.69%. Furthermore, the attention weights indicate that users' opposition stances have a higher impact on their neighbors' behaviors than supportive ones, which function as social correction to halt misinformation propagation. Overall, our study provides an effective predictive model",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管社交媒体平台上流行的谣言传播已成为迫切的挑战，但现有的平台干预措施在遏制其传播方面显示出有限的成功。在本研究中，我们提出了一种立场感知的图神经网络（stance-aware GNN），利用用户的立场主动预测谣言传播。由于不同用户的立场可以形成独特的回声室，我们在立场感知的GNN中定制了四个信息传递路径，而可训练的注意权重通过突出显示每个结构的重要性来提供可解释性。在一个真实数据集上进行评估，立场感知的GNN的表现优于基准模型32.65％，并且超过了没有用户立场的先进GNN 4.69％以上。此外，注意权重表明，用户的反对立场对邻居行为的影响高于支持立场，这起到了社会纠正作用，阻止了谣言的传播。总体而言，我们的研究提供了一种有效的预测模型。",
