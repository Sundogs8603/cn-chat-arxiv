    "translated_abstract": "当前的基于AI的方法无法对所使用的数据、提取的特征和预测/推理操作提供可理解的物理解释。因此，使用高分辨率卫星图像训练的深度学习模型缺乏透明度和可解释性，只能被视为一个黑盒子，这限制了它们的广泛采用。专家需要帮助理解AI模型的复杂行为和基础决策过程。可解释人工智能（XAI）领域是一个新兴领域，提供了确保AI模型稳健、实用和可信赖部署的手段。已有一些XAI技术被提出用于图像分类任务，而对于图像分割的解释则基本上没有被探索。本文通过改进最新的XAI分类算法，并使其适用于多类图像分割，以弥补这一差距，其中我们主要关注高分辨率卫星图像中的建筑物分割。",
