    "translated_abstract": "息肉分割对于预防结直肠癌一种常见的癌症至关重要。深度学习已被用于自动分割息肉，从而减少误诊的风险。结肠镜图像中小的息肉定位具有复杂的特征，例如颜色、遮挡和不同形状的息肉。为了应对这一挑战，提出了一种新型基于频率的全卷积神经网络，称为多频特征融合息肉分割网络（M3FPolypSegNet），用于将输入图像分解为低频/高频/全频组件以利用每个组件的特征。我们使用三个独立的多频编码器将多个输入图像映射到高维特征空间。在频率-ASPP可伸缩注意模块（F-ASPP SAM）中，应用ASPP在每个频率组件之间以保留尺度信息。随后，应用可伸缩注意力强调高维特征中的息肉区域。",
