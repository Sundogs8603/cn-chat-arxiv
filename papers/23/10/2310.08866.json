    "translated_abstract": "变压器是否能够在需要处理不同难度示例的问题上进行有效的泛化？我们引入了一个新的任务，旨在评估对不同复杂度的泛化，并提出的结果表明标准的变压器在解决这些任务时面临挑战。这些任务是由Zhang等人在2021年提出的指针值检索的变体。我们研究了变压器中自适应和模块化计算机制的使用如何促进学习需要在顺序计算步骤数量（即计算图的深度）上进行泛化的任务。基于我们的观察，我们提出了一种基于变压器的架构称为Hyper-UT，它结合了来自超网络的动态函数生成和来自通用变压器的自适应深度。该模型在泛化到更高数量的计算时显示出更高的准确性和更公平的计算资源分配。",
