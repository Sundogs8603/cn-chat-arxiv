    "translated_abstract": "我们关注于在成本敏感的情景下学习对抗性稳健分类器，在这种情况下，不同类别的对抗性变换的潜在危害被编码在一个二进制成本矩阵中。现有的方法要么是经验性的，无法证明稳健性，要么存在固有的可扩展性问题。在这项工作中，我们研究了随机平滑，一种更可扩展的稳健性认证框架，是否可以用于证明成本敏感的稳健性。建立在一种成本敏感认证半径的概念之上，我们展示了如何调整标准的随机平滑认证流程，为任何成本矩阵产生严格的稳健性保证。此外，通过针对不同数据子组设计的细粒度认证半径优化方案，我们提出了一种算法，用于训练针对成本敏感稳健性优化的平滑分类器。在图像基准测试和真实的医学数据集上进行了大量实验，证明了我们方法的优越性。",
