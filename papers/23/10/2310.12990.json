    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种在散射介质中利用大量多样的数据集进行成像的方法。它有两个步骤。第一步使用字典学习算法估计真实的格林函数向量作为无序感知矩阵中的列。阵列数据来自许多稀疏的源集，其位置和强度我们并不知道。在第二步中，使用多维尺度缩放并利用感知矩阵列的交叉相关性导出的连接信息对感知矩阵的列进行排序，就像时间反演一样。为了使这两个步骤能够相互配合工作，我们需要来自大型接收器阵列的数据，以使感知矩阵的列在第一步中不相关，以及来自子阵列的数据，以使它们在第二步中具有足够的相关性以获得所需的连接性。通过模拟实验，我们展示了这种方法能够在复杂介质中提供具有均匀  分辨率的图像。",
