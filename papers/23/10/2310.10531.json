    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了由空间梯度估计驱动的化学趋化和由时间估计驱动的化学趋化之间的边界。尽管人们已经知道在高噪声水平下，对于小生物来说，空间化学趋化变得不利，但目前还不清楚最佳策略是否存在不连续的切换，还是存在连续的过渡。在本研究中，我们采用深度强化学习来研究在先验无限制情况下空间和时间信息的可能整合。我们通过循环神经网络对这种组合化学趋化策略进行参数化，并使用化学趋化细胞的最简理论模型进行评估。通过与受限制的策略变体进行比较，我们发现它在小细胞和大细胞尺寸下分别收敛到纯粹的时间和空间策略。我们发现，这种策略之间的过渡是连续的，组合策略在过渡区域的性能优于受限制的变体及其他单一策略。",
