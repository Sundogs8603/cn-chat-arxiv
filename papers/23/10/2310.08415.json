    "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between political stability and inflation in four South Asian countries, employing panel data spanning from 2001 to 2021. To analyze this relationship, the study utilizes the dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) and fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS) methods, which account for cross-sectional dependence and slope homogeneity in panel data analysis. The findings consistently reveal that increased political stability is associated with lower inflation, while reduced political stability is linked to higher inflation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了政治稳定性与四个南亚国家的通胀之间的关系，采用了从2001年到2021年的面板数据。为了分析这种关系，研究采用了动态普通最小二乘法（DOLS）和完全修正的最小二乘法（FMOLS），这些方法在面板数据分析中考虑了横向相关性和斜率均匀性。研究结果一致表明，政治稳定性的增加与较低的通胀率相关，而政治稳定性的减少与较高的通胀率相关。",
