    "abstract": "The quickly-expanding nature of published medical literature makes it challenging for clinicians and researchers to keep up with and summarize recent, relevant findings in a timely manner. While several closed-source summarization tools based on large language models (LLMs) now exist, rigorous and systematic evaluations of their outputs are lacking. Furthermore, there is a paucity of high-quality datasets and appropriate benchmark tasks with which to evaluate these tools. We address these issues with four contributions: we release Clinfo.ai, an open-source WebApp that answers clinical questions based on dynamically retrieved scientific literature; we specify an information retrieval and abstractive summarization task to evaluate the performance of such retrieval-augmented LLM systems; we release a dataset of 200 questions and corresponding answers derived from published systematic reviews, which we name PubMed Retrieval and Synthesis (PubMedRS-200); and report benchmark results for Cli",

    "translated_abstract": "随着医学文献的快速增长，医生和研究人员很难及时跟上并总结最近的相关发现。虽然现在存在几个基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的闭源摘要工具，但其输出结果缺乏严格和系统的评估。此外，缺乏高质量的数据集和适当的基准任务来评估这些工具。我们通过四个贡献来解决这些问题：我们发布了名为Clinfo.ai的开源WebApp，它基于动态检索的科学文献回答临床问题；我们指定了一个信息检索和抽象概括任务，以评估这种检索增强型LLM系统的性能；我们发布了一个包含200个问题及其对应答案的数据集，我们将其命名为PubMed检索和综述（PubMedRS-200）；并报告了Cli的基准结果。",
