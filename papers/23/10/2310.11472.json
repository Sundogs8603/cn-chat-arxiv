    "translated_abstract": "本文通过整合规范和实证的视角，研究了水资源争端。约翰·罗尔斯的正义理论提供了道德指导，维护所有流域国家的合理获取权利。然而，通过蛋糕切割模型进行实证分析揭示了现实世界中的战略约束。虽然罗尔斯定义了期望的目标，但蛋糕切割提供了基于实际行为的算法手段。尼罗河流域争端说明了这种综合。罗尔斯认为水资源具有天然权利，但无限制的竞争可能导致垄断。在自利等局限性存在的情况下，他的原则本身无法防止不利的结果。这就是蛋糕切割在存在偏见主张的情况下提供价值的地方。其模型确定了与罗尔斯公平原则相符的安排，并纳入了战略考虑。本文详细介绍了蛋糕切割理论，回顾了水资源冲突文献，研究了尼罗河案例，探讨了合作与非合作的情况。",
    "tldr": "通过融合Rawlsian理论和算法手段，本文研究了水资源分配中的公平性问题。蛋糕切割模型在考虑战略因素的同时，寻找与Rawlsian公平原则相一致的解决方案，为解决尼罗河水资源争端提供了有价值的方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This article examines fairness in resource allocation by integrating Rawlsian theory and algorithms. Cake-cutting models, incorporating strategic considerations, are used to find solutions that align with Rawlsian fairness principles, providing valuable approaches to resolving water disputes, as demonstrated in the Nile River case."
