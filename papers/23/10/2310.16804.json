    "translated_abstract": "高度互连的社会很难对传染病如COVID-19的传播进行建模。单一区域的SIR模型无法考虑到入侵性感染力，并且将其扩展到大量互相作用的区域涉及到许多在现实世界中不能成立的假设。我们提议使用普适微分方程（UDEs）来捕捉邻近地区的影响，并在结合SIR + UDE模型中改进模型的预测。UDEs是由深度神经网络（DNN）完全或部分定义的微分方程。我们在SIR方程中加入一个由DNN组成的附加项，该DNN从其他地区学习入侵性感染力。使用自动微分和梯度下降进行学习，以逼近邻近地区状态引起的目标系统变化。我们将所提出的模型与单一区域SIR模型和完全数据驱动模型进行了比较。",
