    "translated_abstract": "对来自输入的不同部分的标记范围进行推理对于自然语言理解（NLU）任务非常重要，例如事实核查（FC）、机器阅读理解（MRC）或自然语言推理（NLI）。然而，现有的基于高亮的解释主要集中在识别个别重要标记或仅在相邻标记或标记元组之间的相互作用。值得注意的是，在这些任务中缺乏捕捉人类决策过程中必要交互的注释。为了填补这一差距，我们介绍了SpanEx，一个关于NLI和FC的人类标记范围交互解释的多注释者数据集。然后，我们研究了多个精调的大型语言模型在输入的不同部分之间使用的连接的决策过程，并将其与人类推理过程进行比较。最后，我们提出了一种基于社区检测的无监督元建模方法。",

The study reveals a lack of annotations capturing the necessary interactions in the human decision-making process, as existing explanations primarily focus on interactions between adjacent tokens or tuples. By comparing large language models with human reasoning processes, the authors find differences between them. Finally, a community detection-based unsupervised metamodeling approach is proposed."
