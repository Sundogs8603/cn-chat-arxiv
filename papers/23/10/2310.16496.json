    "abstract": "In the present era of sustainable innovation, the circular economy paradigm dictates the optimal use and exploitation of existing finite resources. At the same time, the transition to smart infrastructures requires considerable investment in capital, resources and people. In this work, we present a general machine learning approach for offering indoor location awareness without the need to invest in additional and specialised hardware. We explore use cases where visitors equipped with their smart phone would interact with the available WiFi infrastructure to estimate their location, since the indoor requirement poses a limitation to standard GPS solutions. Results have shown that the proposed approach achieves a less than 2m accuracy and the model is resilient even in the case where a substantial number of BSSIDs are dropped.",

    "translated_abstract": "在可持续创新的时代，循环经济范式要求对现有有限资源进行最佳利用和开发。与此同时，向智能基础设施的过渡需要大量的资本、资源和人力投入。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种通用的机器学习方法，用于提供室内定位服务，无需投资额外和专门的硬件设施。我们探索了一些使用案例，访客通过他们的智能手机与可用的WiFi基础设施进行交互，以估计他们的位置，因为室内需求对标准GPS解决方案存在限制。结果表明，我们提出的方法实现了小于2米的精度，并且即使在丢失大量BSSIDs的情况下，模型也具有鲁棒性。",
