    "translated_abstract": "设计灵活的概率模型来建立树形拓扑结构对于开发高效的系统发育推断方法至关重要。为了做到这一点，之前的工作往往利用树形拓扑结构的相似性，通过手工设计的启发式特征来实现，这需要预先采样树形拓扑结构，并且可能受限于近似能力有限。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于图神经网络(GNNs)的深度自回归模型用于系统发育推断，称为ARTree。通过将树形拓扑结构分解为一系列叶节点添加操作，并利用可学习的拓扑特征通过GNNs对所涉及的条件分布进行建模，ARTree可以提供一个丰富的分布族，覆盖整个树形拓扑空间，并具有简单的采样算法和密度估计过程，而无需使用启发式特征。我们在具有挑战性的真实数据树形拓扑密度估计和变分推断基准上展示了我们方法的效果和效率。",
