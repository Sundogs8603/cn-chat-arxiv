    "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential toward intelligent agents and next-gen automation, but there currently lacks a systematic benchmark for evaluating LLMs' abilities as agents. We introduce SmartPlay: both a challenging benchmark and a methodology for evaluating LLMs as agents. SmartPlay consists of 6 different games, including Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tower of Hanoi, Minecraft. Each game features a unique setting, providing up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment variations. Each game in SmartPlay uniquely challenges a subset of 9 important capabilities of an intelligent LLM agent, including reasoning with object dependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and understanding randomness. The distinction between the set of capabilities each game test allows us to analyze each capability separately. SmartPlay serves not only as a rigorous testing ground for evaluating the overall performance of LLM agents but also as",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的大型语言模型(LLMs)在智能Agent和下一代自动化方面展示了巨大的潜力，但目前缺乏一个系统化的基准来评估LLMs作为Agent的能力。我们介绍了SmartPlay：一个具有挑战性的基准和评估LLMs作为Agent的方法论。SmartPlay包括6个不同的游戏，包括剪刀石头布、汉诺塔、Minecraft等。每个游戏都具有独特的设置，提供最多20个评估设置和无限的环境变化。SmartPlay中的每个游戏都独特地挑战了智能LLM Agent的9个重要能力的子集，包括对对象依赖的推理、提前规划、空间推理、从历史中学习和理解随机性。每个游戏测试的能力集的区别使我们能够单独分析每个能力。SmartPlay不仅是评估LLM Agent整体性能的严格测试场地，而且也是评估Agent在不同能力方面的性能的一个重要工具。",
