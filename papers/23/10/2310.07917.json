    "abstract": "For over two decades, detecting rare events has been a challenging task among researchers in the data mining and machine learning domain. Real-life problems inspire researchers to navigate and further improve data processing and algorithmic approaches to achieve effective and computationally efficient methods for imbalanced learning.
