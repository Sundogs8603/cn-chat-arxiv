    "abstract": "Information-seeking questions in long-form question answering (LFQA) often prove misleading due to ambiguity or false presupposition in the question. While many existing approaches handle misleading questions, they are tailored to limited questions, which are insufficient in a real-world setting with unpredictable input characteristics. In this work, we propose PreWoMe, a unified approach capable of handling any type of information-seeking question. The key idea of PreWoMe involves extracting presuppositions in the question and exploiting them as working memory to generate feedback and action about the question. Our experiment shows that PreWoMe is effective not only in tackling misleading questions but also in handling normal ones, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of leveraging presuppositions, feedback, and action for real-world QA settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "长篇问答中的信息检索问题常常由于问题中的模糊或错误预设而误导。虽然许多现有方法可以处理误导性问题，但它们针对的是有限的问题，很难适应实际情况中不可预测的输入特征。在这项工作中，我们提出了PreWoMe，这是一种统一的方法，能够处理任何类型的信息检索问题。PreWoMe的关键思想是提取问题中的预设，并将其作为工作记忆来生成对问题的反馈和行动。我们的实验证明，PreWoMe不仅在解决误导性问题方面有效，而且在处理正常问题方面也很有效，从而证明了在实际问答场景中利用预设、反馈和行动的有效性。",
