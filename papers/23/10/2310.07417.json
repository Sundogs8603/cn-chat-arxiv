    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱是许多数据密集型应用程序的基础，因为它们可以表示数据与其意义和上下文的关联。对齐不同领域和提供者的知识图谱是为了实现更全面和一体化的表示。目前知识图谱对齐算法的一个严重局限是它们无法将逻辑思考和推理与词汇、结构和语义数据学习相结合。深度学习模型在知识图谱对齐方面越来越受欢迎，借鉴了它们在其他任务中的良好表现，但它们在解释性、推理能力和数据效率方面存在局限。混合的神经符号学习模型有望将逻辑和数据视角整合起来，产生可解释的高质量对齐结果，并支持以人为中心的验证方法。本文研究了知识图谱对齐领域的现状，并探讨了神经符号整合的潜力，强调了有前景的研究方向。",
