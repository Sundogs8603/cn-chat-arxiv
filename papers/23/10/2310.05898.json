    "translated_abstract": "通过程序搜索发现的新优化器Lion（进化的符号动量）在训练大型AI模型方面显示出有希望的结果。它在训练效果上与AdamW相当或更好，并具有更高的内存效率。正如我们可以从随机搜索程序的结果中期待的，Lion集成了几个现有算法的元素，包括符号动量、独立的权重衰减、Polak和Nesterov动量，但又不属于任何现有的理论基础优化器类别。因此，尽管Lion作为广泛任务的通用优化器表现良好，但其理论基础仍然不明确。这种缺乏理论的明确性限制了进一步增强和扩展Lion的可能性。本文旨在揭开Lion的神秘面纱。基于连续时间和离散时间分析，我们证明Lion是一种理论上新颖且有原则的方法，可在最小化一般损失函数$f(x)$的同时强制执行边界约束。",
