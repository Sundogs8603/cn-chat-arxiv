    "translated_abstract": "工业系统，如推荐系统和在线广告，已广泛配备了多阶段架构，包括匹配、预排序、排序和再排序。作为匹配和排序之间的关键桥梁，现有的预排序方法主要忽视了整个链路数据的依赖性，导致子优化性能。在本文中，我们从整体样本空间的角度重新思考预排序系统，并提出了整体链路跨域模型（ECM），利用整个级联阶段的样本来有效减轻样本选择偏差（SSB）问题。此外，我们设计了一种细粒度神经结构，名为ECMM，进一步提高了预排序的准确性。具体来说，我们提出了一个跨域多塔神经网络来综合预测每个阶段的结果，并引入$L0$正则化的子网络路由策略来调整每个阶段的贡献权重。",
