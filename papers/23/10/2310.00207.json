    "abstract": "Multiword expressions present unique challenges in many translation tasks. In an attempt to ultimately apply a multiword expression detection system to the translation of American Sign Language, we built and tested two systems that apply word embeddings from GloVe to determine whether or not the word embeddings of lexemes can be used to predict whether or not those lexemes compose a multiword expression. It became apparent that word embeddings carry data that can detect non-compositionality with decent accuracy.",
