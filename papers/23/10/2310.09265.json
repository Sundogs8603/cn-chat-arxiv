    "translated_abstract": "关系抽取旨在将两个实体之间的关系分类到预定义的类别中。尽管先前的研究主要集中在句级别的关系抽取上，但最近的研究将范围扩大到文档级别的关系抽取。传统的关系抽取方法严重依赖于人工标注的训练数据，这是一项耗时且劳动密集的任务。为了减少对手动标注的需求，最近已经开发了一些弱监督方法用于句级别的关系抽取，但在文档级别的关系抽取方面仍然有限的工作。弱监督的文档级别关系抽取面临着一些挑战，比如“没有关系”的实例数量不平衡，以及直接使用预训练的大语言模型进行文档关系抽取的失败。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了PromptRE，一种新颖的基于提示的弱监督文档级别关系抽取方法，结合了基于提示的技术。",
