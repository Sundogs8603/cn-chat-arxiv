    "translated_abstract": "欺诈检测旨在发现欺诈者通过留下假评论或进行异常交易欺骗其他用户。基于图的欺诈检测方法将这个任务视为一个包含两个类别（欺诈或正常）的分类问题。我们通过提出一种动态关系注意聚合机制，利用图神经网络（GNN）来解决这个问题。基于实际世界图表中包含不同类型的关系的观察，我们建议学习每个关系的节点表示，并使用可学习的注意函数聚合节点表示，该函数为每个关系分配不同的注意系数。此外，我们结合不同层次的节点表示，以考虑目标节点的局部和全局结构，这有助于提高在具有异质性的图上进行欺诈检测的性能。通过在所有聚合过程中采用动态图注意力，我们的方法可以自适应地计算关系之间的重要程度。",

The use of dynamic graph attention allows for adaptive computation of the importance between relations."
