    "translated_abstract": "在2020年人口普查中，使用正式的隐私保护措施保护回答的机密性，引发了如何衡量发布的数据产品的披露风险和社会利益的新一轮兴趣和辩论。我们认为，根据经济学和统计学的长期惯例，任何量化披露风险的提议都应基于预先指定的客观准则。这些准则应用于比较不同的方法论，以确定具有最理想特性的方法。我们使用简单的需求指导法来说明这种方法，评估绝对披露风险框架、基于反事实的差分隐私框架以及先验与后验比较。我们得出结论，满足所有需求指导是不可能的，但基于反事实的比较满足最多的需求，而绝对披露风险满足的需求最少。此外，我们解释了针对差分隐私的许多批评观点。",
