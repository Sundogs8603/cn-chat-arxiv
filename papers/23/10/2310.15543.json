To tackle the above limitation, we propose a Multiresolution scheme in combination with Equivariant Graph Attention network (mEGAT) architecture, which can learn the optimal route based on low-level and high-level graph res",

    "translated_abstract": "旅行商问题（TSP）和车辆路径问题（VRP）在准确性和计算时间方面通过机器学习（ML）方法的应用取得了合理的进展。然而，以前的工作都没有完全尊重TSP和VRP中产生的对称性，包括旋转、平移、排列和缩放。在这项工作中，我们引入了第一个完全等变的模型和训练方法来解决组合问题。此外，对于大型和长距离图的情况，捕捉输入图的多尺度结构（即从局部到全局信息）是至关重要的，而以前的方法仅限于提取局部信息，可能导致局部或次优解。为了解决上述限制，我们提出了一个多分辨率方案与等变图注意力网络（mEGAT）结构相结合，可以基于低级别和高级别的图表示学习最佳路径。",
