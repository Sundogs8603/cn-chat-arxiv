    "translated_abstract": "最优传输（OT）理论提供了一种有效的比较定义在指定度量空间上的概率分布的方法，但它的计算复杂度为立方级。尽管Sinkhorn算法极大地降低了OT解的计算复杂度，但在实践中，多个OT问题的解仍然耗时和占用内存。然而，关于OT计算加速的许多工作通常基于单个OT问题的前提，忽视了一个小批量中分布的潜在共同特征。因此，我们提出了一种翻译的OT问题，称为锚定空间优化传输（ASOT）问题，专门用于批处理多个OT问题的解。对于提出的ASOT问题，分布将被映射到一个共享的锚点空间，该空间学习潜在的共同特征，从而帮助加速OT批处理。基于所提出的ASOT，Wasserstei",
