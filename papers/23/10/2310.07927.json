    "abstract": "In this study, we present a graph neural network-based learning approach using an autoencoder setup to derive low-dimensional variables from features observed in experimental crystal structures. These variables are then biased in enhanced sampling to observe state-to-state transitions and reliable thermodynamic weights. Our approach uses simple convolution and pooling methods. To verify the effectiveness of our protocol, we examined the nucleation of various allotropes and polymorphs of iron and glycine from their molten states. Our graph latent variables when biased in well-tempered metadynamics consistently show transitions between states and achieve accurate free energy calculations in agreement with experiments, both of which are indicators of dependable sampling. This underscores the strength and promise of our graph neural net variables for improved sampling. The protocol shown here should be applicable for other systems and with other sampling methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于图神经网络的学习方法，使用自编码器来从实验晶体结构中观察到的特征中推导出低维变量。然后，在增强抽样中对这些变量进行偏置，以观察状态转换和可靠的热力学权重。我们的方法使用简单的卷积和池化方法。为了验证我们的协议的有效性，我们研究了铁和甘氨酸的各种同素异形体和多型体从熔融状态到成核状态的转变。当我们的图潜变量在良温元动力学中进行偏置时，始终显示出状态之间的转变，并且实现了与实验一致的准确自由能计算，这些都是可靠抽样的指标。这凸显了我们的图神经网络变量在改进抽样方面的优势和潜力。这里展示的协议应该适用于其他系统和其他抽样方法。",
