    "translated_abstract": "在编程教育中，抄袭和人工智能（AI）助手的滥用是新兴的问题。然而，关于网页编程方面的相关研究并不多。我们计划开发自动化工具，帮助教师识别这两种不当行为。为了充分了解问题，我们进行了一项控制实验，观察了不公平利益和特点。我们比较了学生独立完成网页编程任务、抄袭提交和使用AI助手（ChatGPT）的表现。我们的研究表明，参与这类不当行为的学生在测试成绩上与独立完成时间较短的学生相当。抄袭的提交与独立提交类似，只是在颜色和标识符名称等细节方面有所不同。使用AI助手的提交更加复杂，降低了可读性。学生认为使用AI助手可能有用，前提是得到适当的使用承认，尽管他们对可读性和...",
