    "translated_abstract": "在线虚假信息的蔓延已经成为社会面临的最大威胁之一。虽然已经付出了相当多的努力来构建虚假信息检测模型，但是虚假信息的危害仍然存在。应对在线虚假信息及其后果需要一个全面的方法，不仅包括对于在线复杂问题和丰富主题信息生态系统与虚假信息之间的复杂关系的理解，还需要了解在其背后驱动虚假信息传播的个体的心理动因。采用时间序列分析技术和强大的因果推断设计，我们进行了一项大规模的观测性研究，分析了超过3200万条COVID-19推文和1600万条历史时间线推文。我们重点研究了COVID-19期间传播虚假信息用户的行为和心理，并将其与在疫情前在非COVID领域分享虚假信息的历史倾向联系起来。我们的分析强调了这种行为的创新性和贡献。",
