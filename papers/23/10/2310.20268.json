    "translated_abstract": "少样本类增量学习旨在构建机器学习模型，能够从少量数据样本中不断学习新概念，同时不会遗忘旧类别的知识。该领域的挑战在于新类别的数据量有限，这不仅会导致严重的过拟合问题，还会加剧臭名昭著的灾难性遗忘问题。正如早期研究证明的那样，构建样本之间的关系对于从少样本中学习是有益的。本文将这一思想推广到增量场景，并提出了一种适用于少样本类增量学习的样本到类别（S2C）图学习方法。具体而言，本文提出了一个样本级图网络（SGN），专注于分析单个会话中样本之间的关系。该网络有助于聚合相似的样本，最终提取出更精细的类别级特征。然后，我们提出了一个类别级图网络（CGN），用于建立新类别和旧类别的类别级特征之间的连接。",
