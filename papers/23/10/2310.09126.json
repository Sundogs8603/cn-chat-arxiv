    "translated_abstract": "低光原始图像去噪在移动摄影中起着至关重要的作用，学习方法已成为主流方法。使用合成数据训练学习方法成为替代对应真实数据的高效实用方法。然而，合成数据的质量受噪声模型精度的限制，降低了低光原始图像去噪的性能。本文提出了一个新颖的准确噪声建模框架，学习一个从暗场中获得的物理引导噪声神经代理（PNNP）。PNNP集成了三种高效技术：物理引导噪声解耦（PND），物理引导代理模型（PPM）和可微分分布导向损失（DDL）。PND将暗场解耦为不同的组分，并以灵活的方式处理不同水平的噪声，降低了噪声神经代理的复杂度。PPM通过引入物理先验有效地约束生成的噪声。",
