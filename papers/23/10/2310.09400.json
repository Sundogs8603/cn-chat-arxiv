    "translated_abstract": "传统的推荐系统在建模用户和物品时 heavily relied on identity representations (IDs)，而预训练语言模型 (PLM) 的兴起丰富了对情境化物品描述的建模。然而，尽管 PLM 在解决 few-shot、zero-shot 或统一建模场景方面非常有效，但常常忽视了关键的协同过滤信号。这种忽视带来了两个紧迫的挑战：(1) 协作情境化，即协同信号与情境化表示的无缝集成。(2) 在保留它们的情境语义的同时，弥合基于ID的表示和情境化表示之间的表示差距的必要性。在本文中，我们提出了CollabContext，一种新颖的模型，能够巧妙地将协同过滤信号与情境化表示结合起来，并将这些表示对齐在情境空间内，保留了重要的情境语义。实验结果表明...",
