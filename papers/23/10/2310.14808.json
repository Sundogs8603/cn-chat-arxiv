    "abstract": "A comprehensive examination of data science vocabulary usage over the past 13 years in this work is conducted. The investigation commences with a dataset comprising 16,018 abstracts that feature the term \"data science\" in either the title, abstract, or keywords. The study involves the identification of documents that introduce novel vocabulary and subsequently explores how this vocabulary has been incorporated into scientific literature. To achieve these objectives, I employ techniques such as Exploratory Data Analysis, Latent Semantic Analysis, Latent Dirichlet Analysis, and N-grams Analysis. A comparison of scientific publications between overall results and those specific to Saudi Arabia is presented. Based on how the vocabulary is utilized, representative articles are identified.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文对过去13年中数据科学词汇的使用情况进行了全面考察。研究从一个包含16,018个摘要的数据集开始，这些摘要中出现了“数据科学”一词，无论是标题、摘要还是关键词。研究包括识别引入新词汇的文献，并进一步探索这些词汇如何被纳入科学文献中。为了实现这些目标，我采用了探索性数据分析、潜在语义分析、潜在狄利克雷分析和N-gram分析等技术。文章还展示了整体结果和沙特阿拉伯特定结果之间的科学出版物比较。根据词汇的使用方式，我们确定了代表性文章。",
