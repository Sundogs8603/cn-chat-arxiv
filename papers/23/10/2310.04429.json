    "translated_abstract": "网络数据分析现在是几乎每个网络解决方案的核心。然而，由于现代网络的复杂性、商业敏感性、隐私和监管限制等多种原因，获得网络数据的访问受到了长期的挑战。在这项工作中，我们探讨了如何利用扩散模型（DM）的最新进展来生成合成网络流量数据。我们开发了一个端到端的框架NetDiffus，该框架首先将一维时间序列网络流量转换为二维图像，然后合成原始数据的代表性图像。我们证明，NetDiffus在生成的数据的保真度方面比基于生成对抗网络（GANs）的最先进的流量生成方法提供了66.4%的提高，并提高了18.1%的下游机器学习任务的性能。我们在七个不同的流量跟踪上评估了NetDiffus，并显示利用合成数据可以显著提高流量分析能力。",
