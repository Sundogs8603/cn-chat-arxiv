    "translated_abstract": "动态图上的异常检测是指检测行为明显偏离图中观察到的规范行为的实体和它们的时间信息。这个领域因其在金融、网络安全、社交网络等方面的应用而受到越来越多的关注。然而，现有方法面临两个挑战：动态结构构建挑战-难以捕捉带有复杂时间信息的图结构，以及负采样挑战-无法构建优秀的负采样进行无监督学习。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了在动态图上的无监督生成异常检测（GADY）。为了解决第一个挑战，我们提出了一个连续的动态图模型来捕捉细粒度信息，突破了现有离散方法的限制。具体地，我们采用了一个消息传递框架结合位置特征来获取边的嵌入，通过解码来识别异常。对于第二个挑战，我们通过引入一个负采样模块来构造优秀的负样本，从而提高无监督学习的性能。",
