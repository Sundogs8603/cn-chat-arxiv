    "translated_abstract": "大多数现有的数据驱动电力系统短期电压稳定性评估方法假定输入数据平衡。然而，在实际应用中，干扰后短期电压不稳定性的发生很少，导致显著的类别不平衡问题和分类器性能下降。本文提出了一种基于Transformer架构的短期电压稳定性评估方法来解决这个挑战。通过利用基本的Transformer架构，开发了一种稳定性评估Transformer (StaaT)作为一个分类模型，以反映系统运行状态与稳定性结果之间的相关性。为了解决不平衡数据集的负面影响，本文采用了带有梯度惩罚的条件Wasserstein生成对抗网络 (CWGAN-GP)进行合成数据生成，帮助创建一个平衡、代表性的训练集用于分类器。",
