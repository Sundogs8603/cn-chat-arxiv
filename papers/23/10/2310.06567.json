    "translated_abstract": "解释黑箱模型的主要挑战之一是能够将非互不相关随机输入的平方可积函数唯一分解为每个可能子集的函数之和。然而，处理输入之间的依赖关系可能很复杂。我们提出了一个新的框架来研究这个问题，将三个数学领域联系起来：概率论、函数分析和组合数学。我们表明，在输入上的两个合理假设下（非完美的函数依赖性和非退化的随机依赖性），总是可以唯一分解这样一个函数。这种“规范分解”相对直观，揭示了非线性相关输入的非线性函数的线性特性。在这个框架中，我们有效地推广了众所周知的Hoeffding分解，可以看作是一个特殊情况。黑箱模型的斜投影为新颖的可解释性指标提供了可能。",
