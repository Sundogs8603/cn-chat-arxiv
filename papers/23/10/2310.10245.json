    "abstract": "Wearing a mask is one of the important measures to prevent infectious diseases. However, it is difficult to detect people's mask-wearing situation in public places with high traffic flow. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a mask-wearing face detection model based on YOLOv5l. Firstly, Multi-Head Attentional Self-Convolution not only improves the convergence speed of the model but also enhances the accuracy of the model detection. Secondly, the introduction of Swin Transformer Block is able to extract more useful feature information, enhance the detection ability of small targets, and improve the overall accuracy of the model. Our designed I-CBAM module can improve target detection accuracy. In addition, using enhanced feature fusion enables the model to better adapt to object detection tasks of different scales. In the experimentation on the MASK dataset, the results show that the model proposed in this paper achieved a 1.1% improvement in mAP(0.5) and a 1.3% improvement",

    "translated_abstract": "戴口罩是预防传染病的重要措施之一，然而在人流量较大的公共场所很难检测到人们佩戴口罩的情况。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种基于YOLOv5l的口罩佩戴人脸检测模型。首先，引入了多头注意力自卷积，不仅提高了模型的收敛速度，还增强了模型的检测精度。其次，引入了Swin Transformer Block，能够提取更多有用的特征信息，增强对小目标的检测能力，提高模型的整体精度。我们设计的I-CBAM模块可以提高目标检测的准确性。此外，采用增强的特征融合使得模型能够更好地适应不同尺度的目标检测任务。在MASK数据集上的实验结果表明，本文提出的模型在mAP(0.5)上取得了1.1%的提升和1.3%的改善。",
