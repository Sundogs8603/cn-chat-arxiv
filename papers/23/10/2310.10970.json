    "abstract": "The physics-informed neural network (PINN) is capable of recovering partial differential equation (PDE) coefficients that remain constant throughout the spatial domain directly from physical measurements. In this work, we propose a spatially dependent physics-informed neural network (SD-PINN), which enables the recovery of coefficients in spatially-dependent PDEs using a single neural network, eliminating the requirement for domain-specific physical expertise. The proposed method exhibits robustness to noise owing to the incorporation of physical constraints. It can also incorporate the low-rank assumption of the spatial variation for the PDE coefficients to recover the coefficients at locations without available measurements.",

    "translated_abstract": "物理知识驱动的神经网络（PINN）能够直接从物理测量中恢复在整个空间域中保持不变的偏微分方程（PDE）系数。在本文中，我们提出了一种空间相关的物理知识驱动神经网络（SD-PINN），它通过一个单一的神经网络来恢复空间相关的PDE系数，消除了对领域特定的物理专业知识的要求。所提出的方法由于加入了物理约束而对噪声具有稳健性。它还能够将PDE系数的空间变化低秩假设纳入考虑，从而恢复没有可用测量数据的位置的系数。",
