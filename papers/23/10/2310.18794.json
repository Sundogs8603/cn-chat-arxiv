    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们提出了序列级确定性作为基于知识的对话生成中虚构情况的共同主题。我们探讨了幻觉水平与两种序列级确定性之间的相关性：概率确定性和语义确定性。实证结果表明，模型响应中两种序列级确定性水平的提高与虚构水平的降低相关。我们进一步提出了基于确定性的响应排序（CRR），这是一种解码时的幻觉缓解方法，根据它们的序列级确定性对响应候选进行排序，并输出具有最高确定性水平的答案。与我们关于序列级确定性的定义相一致，我们设计了两种CRR方法：概率CRR（P-CRR）和语义CRR（S-CRR）。P-CRR使用整个序列的算术平均对各个单独抽样的模型响应进行排名",

This work proposes sequence-level certainty based on probabilistic and semantic certainty, showing that higher certainty levels are correlated with lower hallucination levels, and introduces a certainty-based response ranking method."
