Traditional credit scoring methods, however, often grapple with challenges such as narrow knowledge scope and isolated evaluation of credit tasks. Our work posits that Large Language Models (LLMs) have great potential for credit scoring tasks, with strong generalization ability across multiple tasks. To systematically explore LLMs for credit scoring, we propose the first open-source comprehensive framework. We curate a novel benchmark covering 9 datasets with 14K samples, tailored for credit assessment and a critical examination of potential biases within LLMs, and the novel instruction tuning data with over 45k samples. We then propose the first Credit and Risk Assessment Large Language Model (CALM) by instruction tuning, tailored to the nuanced demands of various",

    "translated_abstract": "在金融行业，信用评分是一个基础要素，塑造着个人和企业的信贷准入，决定着贷款条件。本研究认为，大型语言模型（LLMs）在信用评分任务中具有巨大潜力，能够强大地跨多个任务进行泛化。为了系统地探索LLMs在信用评分中的应用，我们提出了第一个开源全面框架。我们收集了一个涵盖9个数据集、1.4K样本的新型基准，专门用于信用评估，并对LLMs内潜在偏见进行了重要检查，同时提供了超过45K样本的新型指导调整数据。然后，我们通过指导调整提出了首个信贷与风险评估大型语言模型（CALM），以针对不同的微妙需求",
