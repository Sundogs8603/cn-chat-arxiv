    "abstract": "Although traffic is one of the massively collected data, it is often only available for specific regions. One concern is that, although there are studies that give good results for these data, the data from these regions may not be sufficiently representative to describe all the traffic patterns in the rest of the world. In quest of addressing this concern, we propose a speed prediction method that is independent of large historical speed data. To predict a vehicle's speed, we use the trajectory road topographical features to fit a Shared Weight Multilayer Perceptron learning model. Our results show significant improvement, both qualitative and quantitative, over standard regression analysis. Moreover, the proposed framework sheds new light on the way to design new approaches for traffic analysis.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管交通是一种大规模收集的数据，但通常只在特定区域可用。一个问题是，虽然有研究对这些数据给出了良好的结果，但这些地区的数据可能不足以充分描述全球其他地区的所有交通模式。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种独立于大量历史速度数据的速度预测方法。为了预测车辆的速度，我们使用车辆轨迹的道路地形特征来拟合一个共享权重多层感知机学习模型。我们的结果在定性和定量上都显著改进了标准回归分析。此外，该提出的框架为设计交通分析的新方法提供了新的视角。",
