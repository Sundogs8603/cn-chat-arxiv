    "translated_abstract": "鲁棒主成分分析(RPCA)是一种广泛应用的方法，用于从受到显著和稀疏异常数据干扰的数据矩阵中恢复低秩结构。这些异常可能来自遮挡、恶意篡改或其他异常原因，对于过程监测和诊断，联合识别这些异常与低秩背景至关重要。然而，现有的RPCA方法及其扩展在很大程度上未考虑数据矩阵的概率分布，而在许多应用中，这些分布是已知的且可能高度非高斯的。因此，我们提出了一种新的方法，称为面向指数族分布的鲁棒主成分分析($e^{\\text{RPCA}}$)，可以在指数族分布内进行所需的低秩和稀疏矩阵分解。我们提出了一种新颖的交替方向乘子优化算法，用于高效的$e^{\\text{RPCA}}$分解。",
