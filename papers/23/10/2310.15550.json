    "translated_abstract": "正电子发射断层扫描（PET）是一种在临床诊断中广泛应用的高灵敏度的分子成像技术。减少PET的辐射暴露，同时保持足够的图像质量是一个问题。最近采用卷积神经网络（CNN）从低剂量PET生成合成高质量图像的方法被报道为低到高图像恢复技术的最先进方法。然而，这些方法易于展示合成图像和真实图像之间的纹理和结构差异。此外，低剂量PET和标准PET之间的分布偏移尚未完全研究。为了解决这些问题，我们开发了一种自我监督自适应残差估计生成对抗网络（SS-AEGAN）。我们引入了（1）自适应残差估计映射机制AE-Net，该机制通过采用低剂量PET和合成PET之间的残差图动态修正初步合成的PET图像。",
