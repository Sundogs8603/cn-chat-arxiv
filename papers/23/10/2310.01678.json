    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种称为Score dynamics (SD) 的通用框架，用于从分子动力学模拟中学习有效的演化算子，用于原子级和粗粒化动力学。SD以分数为中心，即与动态自由度的转换对数概率导数相关的量。后者在分数时间步中起到与MD中力场相同的作用，但在去噪扩散概率模型中用于生成动态变量的离散转变。这种时间步长可以比典型的MD时间步长大几个数量级。在这项工作中，我们构建了基于图神经网络的Score dynamics模型，用于演化以1~ps时间步长的现实分子体系。我们通过丙氨酸二肽和水溶液中的短链烷烃的案例研究证明了Score dynamics的效能。通过从条件概率的平稳分布中推导出的平衡预测和对转换速率和转换的动力学预测进行演示。",
