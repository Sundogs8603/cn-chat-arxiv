    "translated_abstract": "反向词典是一种工具，可根据提供的定义、含义或描述来发现一个词。这种技术在各种场景中都非常有价值，可以帮助掌握一个词的描述而不知其身份的语言学习者，并使寻求精确术语的写作者受益。这些场景通常涵盖被称为“舌尖上的词”现象。在这项工作中，我们呈现了我们在阿拉伯语反向词典共享任务中获胜的解决方案。该任务的重点是从伴随的描述中推导出阿拉伯词的向量表示。共享任务包括两个不同的子任务：第一个子任务涉及一个阿拉伯定义作为输入，而第二个子任务则使用一个英文定义。对于第一个子任务，我们的方法依赖于一组经过微调的阿拉伯BERT模型，来预测给定定义的词嵌入。最终表示是通过对每个模型输出的嵌入进行平均得到的。",
