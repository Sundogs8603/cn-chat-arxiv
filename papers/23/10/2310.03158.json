    "abstract": "Accurate quantification of model uncertainty has long been recognized as a fundamental requirement for trusted AI. In regression tasks, uncertainty is typically quantified using prediction intervals calibrated to an ad-hoc operating point, making evaluation and comparison across different studies relatively difficult. Our work leverages: (1) the concept of operating characteristics curves and (2) the notion of a gain over a null reference, to derive a novel operating point agnostic assessment methodology for prediction intervals. The paper defines the Uncertainty Characteristics Curve and demonstrates its utility in selected scenarios. We argue that the proposed method addresses the current need for comprehensive assessment of prediction intervals and thus represents a valuable addition to the uncertainty quantification toolbox.",

    "translated_abstract": "准确量化模型的不确定性已经被认为是可信AI的基本要求。在回归任务中，不确定性通常使用校准到专有操作点的预测区间来量化，从而使得对不同研究进行评估和比较相对困难。我们的工作利用了(1)操作特征曲线的概念和(2)相对于空白参考的收益概念，推导出一种新颖的操作点不可知评估方法，适用于预测区间。本文定义了不确定特征曲线，并在选定场景中展示其实用性。我们认为，所提出的方法解决了对预测区间进行全面评估的当前需求，因此是不确定性量化工具箱的宝贵补充。",
