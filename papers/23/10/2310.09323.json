    "translated_abstract": "欧洲不断上涨的能源价格和迫切需要解决全球变暖问题，在国内安装光伏系统以利用太阳能的需求显著增加。然而，由于太阳能只在白天可用且其可用性每天都有所变化，有效地转移能源使用变得至关重要。虽然电池可以帮助储存多余能源，但高昂的价格限制了其广泛推广。在本研究中，我们探讨了负荷的重要性以最大化投资回报。我们提出了一种逐步逼近的方法将负荷曲线适应到生产能力范围内，以便实际实施。我们比较了不同的仪表分辨率：1秒、5分钟、15分钟和1小时。我们的分析揭示了实时决策（每秒）相较于每小时决策，节能16％。此外，我们探讨了三种设备管理策略：独立于光伏的开/关管理",
