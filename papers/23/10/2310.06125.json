    "translated_abstract": "语音分离对多说话者技术研究人员仍然是一个重要的主题。卷积增强转换器（conformer）在许多语音处理任务中表现良好，但在语音分离方面得到的研究较少。最近的最先进（SOTA）分离模型大多数是时域音频分离网络（TasNets）。一些成功的模型利用了双通道（DP）网络，它们按顺序处理局部和全局信息。时域Conformer（TD-Conformers）是DP方法的一个类比，它们也按顺序处理局部和全局上下文，但具有不同的时间复杂度函数。实验结果表明，在实际较短的信号长度下，相对于特征维度，Conformer在控制特征维度时更高效。提出了子采样层以进一步提高计算效率。最佳的TD-Conformer在WHAMR和WSJ0-2Mix基准上分别实现了14.6dB和21.2dB的SISDR改进。",
