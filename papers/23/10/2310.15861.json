    "abstract": "Why do agents adopt a particular general behavioral rule among a collection of possible alternatives? To address this question, we introduce a dynamic social learning framework, where agents rely on general rules of thumb and imitate the behavioral rules of successful peers. We find the social learning outcome can be characterized independent of the initial rule distribution. When one dominant general rule consistently yields superior problem-specific outcomes, social learning almost surely leads all agents to adopt this dominant rule; otherwise, provided the population is sufficiently large, the better rule for the more frequent problem becomes the consensus rule with arbitrarily high probability. As a result, the behavioral rule selected by the social learning process need not maximize social welfare. We complement our theoretical analysis with an application to the market sentiment selection in a stochastic production market.",

    "translated_abstract": "为什么在可能的多个行为规则中，个体会选择特定的一般行为规则？为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一个动态社会学习框架，在这个框架中，个体依赖于一般的经验之规并模仿成功的同伴的行为规则。我们发现社会学习的结果可以独立于初始规则分布进行描述。当一个主导的一般规则始终产生出优越的问题特定结果时，社会学习几乎肯定会导致所有个体采纳这个主导规则；否则，只要人口足够大，更频繁问题的较好规则会以任意高的概率成为共识规则。因此，在社会学习过程中选择的行为规则不一定能最大化社会福利。我们通过在随机生产市场中应用市场情绪选择来补充我们的理论分析。",

We find that the outcome of social learning is independent of the initial rule distribution, and if one dominant rule consistently yields superior outcomes, it will almost surely be adopted by all individuals. Otherwise, the better rule for the more frequent problem becomes the consensus rule. Therefore, the selected rule in the social learning process may not maximize social welfare."
