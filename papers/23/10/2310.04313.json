    "title": "Large-Scale Korean Text Dataset for Classifying Biased Speech in Real-World Online Services. (arXiv:2310.04313v1 [cs.CL])",
    "abstract": "With the growth of online services, the need for advanced text classification algorithms, such as sentiment analysis and biased text detection, has become increasingly evident. The anonymous nature of online services often leads to the presence of biased and harmful language, posing challenges to maintaining the health of online communities. This phenomenon is especially relevant in South Korea, where large-scale hate speech detection algorithms have not yet been broadly explored. In this paper, we introduce a new comprehensive, large-scale dataset collected from a well-known South Korean SNS platform. Our proposed dataset provides annotations including (1) Preferences, (2) Profanities, and (3) Nine types of Bias for the text samples, enabling multi-task learning for simultaneous classification of user-generated texts. Leveraging state-of-the-art BERT-based language models, our approach surpasses human-level accuracy across diverse classification tasks, as measured by various metrics. ",

    "translated_abstract": "随着在线服务的增长，对高级文本分类算法（如情感分析和有偏文本检测）的需求越来越明显。在线服务的匿名性常常导致有偏见和有害言语的存在，对维护在线社区的健康带来挑战。这种现象在韩国尤其相关，目前尚未广泛研究大规模仇恨言论检测算法。在本文中，我们介绍了一个新的综合、大规模数据集，该数据集是从一个知名的韩国社交网络平台收集而来的。我们提供了包括(1)偏好、(2)低俗语言和(3)九种偏见类型的文本样本的注释，使得能够同时对用户生成的文本进行多任务学习的分类。利用最先进的基于BERT的语言模型，我们的方法在各种指标下超过了人类水平的准确性。",
