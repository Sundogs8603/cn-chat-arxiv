    "translated_abstract": "虽然大型语言模型 (LLMs) 经常在大规模多语种文本上进行预训练，但它们的推理能力和现实世界知识主要是基于英文数据集进行评估的。评估LLM在英文以外的能力变得越来越重要，但由于缺乏合适的数据集而受阻。在这项工作中，我们介绍了IndoMMLU，这是首个用于印尼文化和语言的多任务语言理解基准测试，包括印度尼西亚中小学到高等教育入学考试的问题。通过聘请专业教师，我们获得了14,981个问题，涵盖了64个任务和教育水平，并有46%的问题专注于评估对印尼语的熟练程度以及对印度尼西亚九个地方语言和文化的了解。我们的实证评估表明，GPT-3.5仅能通过印尼的中小学水平，对印尼地方语言和文化的知识有限。其他较小的模型，如BLOOMZ和Falcon，也有类似的表现。",
