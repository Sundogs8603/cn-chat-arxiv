    "translated_abstract": "在越来越多地采用大型语言模型（LLMs）处理各种任务的时代，人们越来越关注探索LLMs在处理网络数据，特别是图形数据方面的能力。动态图在现实世界的网络数据中无处不在，它们捕捉了网络演化模式。评估LLMs在理解动态图上的时空信息方面的能力对于它们在Web应用中的采用至关重要，然而这在文献中尚未得到探索。本文通过首次提出在动态图上评估LLMs的时空理解能力来填补这一空白。具体而言，我们提出了LLM4DyG基准，其中包括九个特别设计的任务，考虑了LLMs在时态和空间维度上的能力评估。然后，我们进行了广泛的实验，分析了不同的数据生成器、数据统计、提示技术和LLMs对模型性能的影响。",
