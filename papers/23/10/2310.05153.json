    "translated_abstract": "本文通过将实际和金融部门整合起来，实证评估Goodwin关于需求和分配体制的周期性增长模型的预测，同时评估了金融和就业冲击对六个不同的美国经济周期峰值上的劳动力市场和货币政策变量的影响。它通过使用劳动收入份额、就业率、住宅投资和利率差等内生变量的一种简化的具有随机波动的时变向量自回归模型（TVP-VAR-SV），并采用贝叶斯推断方法，关键结果表明（i）利润驱动的需求和利润挤压的分配的组合；（ii）在“大幅缓和”期间这些体制的减弱；以及（iii）标准的Goodwin变量与住宅投资和利率差之间存在显著联系。本研究的结果总体上符合金融和劳动力市场日益解除管制的转型。",

Through studying various U.S. business-cycle peaks, it identifies the existence of profit-led demand and profit-squeeze distribution regimes and their weakening during the Great Moderation. The study also establishes significant connections between standard Goodwinian variables and residential investment as well as the interest rate spread."
