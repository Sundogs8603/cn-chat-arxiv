    "translated_abstract": "动态分析通过在受控环境中执行程序并将其行为存储在日志报告中，可以检测Windows恶意软件。先前的工作已经开始在这些报告上训练机器学习模型以进行恶意软件检测或分类。然而，大多数方法仅考虑了卷积和长短期记忆网络，只关注运行时调用的API，并未考虑其他相关的异构信息来源，如网络和文件操作。此外，代码和预训练模型很难获取，这限制了该研究领域中结果的可重现性。在本文中，我们通过提出Nebula来克服这些限制，这是一个多功能的、基于自注意力的转换器神经架构，可以概括不同的行为表示和格式，结合动态日志报告中的异构信息。我们展示了Nebula的有效性，它在三个重要任务上的实验中表现出色。",
