    "translated_abstract": "细粒度实体类型定义（FET）是根据上下文信息识别实体提及中特定实体类型的任务。传统的FET方法需要大量的人工标注，耗时且昂贵。最近的研究提出了弱监督或零样本方法。我们研究了只提供本体的零样本FET设置。然而，大多数现有的本体结构缺乏丰富的支持信息，甚至含有模糊的关系，导致它们在指导FET方面效果不佳。最近发展的语言模型，在各种几样本和零样本的自然语言处理任务中取得了很好的结果，但由于缺乏与任务相关的本体的互动，可能在零样本FET方面面临挑战。在这项研究中，我们提出了OnEFET，我们通过两种类型的额外信息对本体结构中的每个节点进行增强：实例信息用于训练样本增强，主题信息用于将类型与上下文关联起来。",

    "en_tdlr": "In this paper, we propose OnEFET, which enriches each node in the ontology structure with additional information, including instance information and topic information, to enhance zero-shot fine-grained entity typing. This approach effectively guides the task of identifying fine-grained entity types."
