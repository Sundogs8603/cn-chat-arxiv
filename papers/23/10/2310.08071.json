    "translated_abstract": "尽管深度神经网络在无监督领域适应（UDA）方面取得了巨大进展，但目前的UDA模型不透明，无法提供令人满意的解释，限制了其在需要安全和可控模型决策的场景中的应用。目前，有大量的研究专注于设计具有充分数据注释的深度可解释方法，只有少数方法考虑了分布偏移问题。大多数现有的可解释UDA方法是事后方法，不能促进模型学习过程以提升性能。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为Transferable Conceptual Prototype Learning（TCPL）的本质上可解释的方法，它可以同时解释和改进UDA中的知识转移和决策过程。为了实现这一目标，我们设计了一个层次化的原型模块，从源域传输分类基本概念到目标域并学习领域共享的原型。",
