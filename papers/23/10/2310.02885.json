    "abstract": "We present a method to improve the calibration of deep ensembles in the small training data regime in the presence of unlabeled data. Our approach is extremely simple to implement: given an unlabeled set, for each unlabeled data point, we simply fit a different randomly selected label with each ensemble member. We provide a theoretical analysis based on a PAC-Bayes bound which guarantees that if we fit such a labeling on unlabeled data, and the true labels on the training data, we obtain low negative log-likelihood and high ensemble diversity on testing samples. Empirically, through detailed experiments, we find that for low to moderately-sized training sets, our ensembles are more diverse and provide better calibration than standard ensembles, sometimes significantly.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种在小训练数据情况下利用无标签数据改进深度合奏模型校准的方法。我们的方法非常简单：对于每个无标签数据点，在每个合奏成员中，我们随机选择一个不同的标签进行拟合。我们基于PAC-Bayes边界提供了一个理论分析，保证如果我们在无标签数据上进行这样的标签拟合，并在训练数据上使用真实标签，在测试样本上可以得到较低的负对数似然和较高的合奏多样性。通过详细的实验证明，对于训练集规模较小到中等规模的情况，我们的合奏模型比标准的合奏模型更具多样性，并提供更好的校准效果，有时显著地。",
