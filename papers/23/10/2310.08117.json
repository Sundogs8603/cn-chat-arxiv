    "translated_abstract": "车联网协作感知对于自动驾驶至关重要。然而，实现高精度的车联网协作感知需要大量的真实世界数据进行注释，这往往是昂贵且难以获取的。模拟数据因其可以以极低的成本大量生产而受到广泛关注。然而，模拟数据与真实世界数据之间存在显著的领域差距，包括传感器类型、反射模式和道路环境的差异，导致在模拟数据上训练的模型在真实世界数据上评估时性能较差。此外，真实世界协作代理之间仍存在领域差距，例如不同类型的传感器可能安装在自动驾驶车辆和路边基础设施上，且具有不同的外部参数，进一步增加了模拟到实际的泛化难度。为充分利用模拟数据，我们提出了一种新的无监督模拟到实际领域适应方法。",
