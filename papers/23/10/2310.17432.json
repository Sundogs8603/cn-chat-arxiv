    "abstract": "Out-of-Distribution detection between dataset pairs has been extensively explored with generative models. We show that likelihood-based Out-of-Distribution detection can be extended to diffusion models by leveraging the fact that they, like other likelihood-based generative models, are dramatically affected by the input sample complexity. Currently, all Out-of-Distribution detection methods with Diffusion Models are reconstruction-based. We propose a new likelihood ratio for Out-of-Distribution detection with Deep Denoising Diffusion Models, which we call the Complexity Corrected Likelihood Ratio. Our likelihood ratio is constructed using Evidence Lower-Bound evaluations from an individual model at various noising levels. We present results that are comparable to state-of-the-art Out-of-Distribution detection methods with generative models.",

    "translated_abstract": "使用生成模型进行数据集之间的离群检测已经得到广泛探索。我们展示了基于似然的离群检测可以通过利用扩散模型受输入样本复杂性影响的观察来扩展到扩散模型。目前，所有基于扩散模型的离群检测方法都是基于重构的。我们提出了一种新的离群检测似然比，称为复杂度校正似然比。我们的似然比是通过在各种噪声水平下使用个体模型的证据下界评估构造的。我们展示的结果与基于生成模型的最先进离群检测方法相媲美。",
