    "translated_abstract": "图分区旨在将图分割为k个不相交的子集，同时优化特定的分区目标。由于其组合性质，大部分与图分区相关的问题都呈现出NP难度。因此，传统的近似算法依赖于启发式方法，有时带有近似保证，有时则没有。不幸的是，传统方法针对特定的分区目标进行优化，不适用于其他已知的文献中的分区目标。为了克服这个限制，并直接从数据中学习启发式方法，神经方法应运而生，并展示出令人期待的结果。在本研究中，我们通过一个新颖的框架NeuroCut扩展了这一领域的工作。NeuroCut在现有方法上引入了两个关键创新。首先，它对图拓扑和分区计数具有归纳性，这些信息在查询时提供。其次，通过利用强化学习基础",
