    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）取得了成功，但定理证明仍然是最难的推理任务之一，尚未完全解决。以往使用语言模型的方法取得了有希望的结果，但仍难以证明中学水平的定理。这些方法的一个常见限制是在整个定理证明过程中假设了一个固定的定理库。然而，众所周知，创造新的有用定理甚至新的理论不仅有帮助而且对于推动数学发展和证明更困难和深入的结果是至关重要和必要的。在这项工作中，我们介绍了LEGO-Prover，它采用一个包含经过验证的引理的不断增长的技能库，以增强用于定理证明的LLMs的能力。通过模块化构建证明，LEGO-Prover使LLMs能够利用从库检索到的现有技能，以及在证明过程中创建新技能。这些技能通过简化证明过程并提供更强大的推理能力。",
