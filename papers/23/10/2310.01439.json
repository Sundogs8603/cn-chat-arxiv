    "abstract": "This paper introduces a formal definition of the setting of ad hoc teamwork under partial observability and proposes a first-principled model-based approach which relies only on prior knowledge and partial observations of the environment in order to perform ad hoc teamwork. We make three distinct assumptions that set it apart previous works, namely: i) the state of the environment is always partially observable, ii) the actions of the teammates are always unavailable to the ad hoc agent and iii) the ad hoc agent has no access to a reward signal which could be used to learn the task from scratch. Our results in 70 POMDPs from 11 domains show that our approach is not only effective in assisting unknown teammates in solving unknown tasks but is also robust in scaling to more challenging problems.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了在部分可观察性下的即兴团队合作的正式定义，并提出了一种基于模型的方法，该方法仅依赖于先前知识和对环境的部分观察，以执行即兴团队合作。我们提出了三个与之前的研究不同的假设，即：i）环境的状态始终部分可观察，ii）队友的动作对即兴代理不可用，iii）即兴代理无法访问用于从头开始学习任务的奖励信号。我们基于11个领域的70个POMDPs的结果表明，我们的方法不仅能够有效地帮助解决未知任务的未知队友，而且在应对更具挑战性的问题时也具有鲁棒性。",
