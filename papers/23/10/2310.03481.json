    "translated_abstract": "以用户活动为基础，个性化地提供高质量的推荐对于电子商务平台至关重要，特别是在用户意图不明确的情况下，如主页上。最近，基于嵌入式的个性化系统在电子商务领域的推荐和搜索结果质量方面有了显著的提升。然而，这些工作大多集中在增强检索阶段。在本文中，我们证明了针对电子商务推荐中的排名阶段，检索聚焦的深度学习模型产生的特征是次优的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个两阶段训练过程，通过微调两塔模型来实现最佳的排名性能。我们详细描述了我们专门为电子商务个性化设计的基于Transformer的两塔模型架构。此外，我们还引入了一种新颖的离线模型中去偏置上下文的技术。",
