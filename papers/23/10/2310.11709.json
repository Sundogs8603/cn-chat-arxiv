    "translated_abstract": "进行了大量研究来调查大规模时间图的特性。尽管这些图在现实场景中普遍存在，但由于隐私问题和技术限制，我们通常无法获取整个实时图。在本文中，我们介绍了用于时间图的“实时图实验室”概念，该实验室可以从区块链中提取开放、动态和实时的交易图。其中，非同质化代币（NFT）在过去几年中成为区块链中最重要的部分之一。这个分散化生态系统具有超过400亿美元的市值，产生了大量的匿名和实时交易活动，自然形成了一个复杂的交易网络。然而，从时间图分析的角度对这个新兴的NFT生态系统的特性了解有限。为了弥补这一差距，我们使用NFT交易网络实例化了一个实时图并进行了调查。",
