    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种通用方法，用于实现G-等变卷积神经网络（G-CNNs）中的强组不变性，我们将其称为G-三重相关（G-TC）层。该方法利用了群上的三重相关理论，该理论是唯一的、最低次数的多项式不变映射，同时也是完备的。许多常用的不变映射，例如max，是不完备的：它们会同时去除群和信号结构。相比之下，完备的不变映射只移除由于群作用引起的变化，同时保留有关信号结构的所有信息。三重相关的完备性赋予了G-TC层强大的鲁棒性，这可以在其对不变性攻击的抵抗中观察到。此外，我们观察到它相比于G-CNN架构中的标准Max G-Pooling在分类准确率上有明显的改善。我们提供了该方法的通用且高效的实现。",
