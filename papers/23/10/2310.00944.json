    "translated_abstract": "激光雷达传感器被用于自动驾驶应用中准确感知环境。然而，它们受到雪、雾和雨等恶劣天气条件的影响。这些日常现象会引入不必要的噪音到测量中，严重降低基于激光雷达的感知系统的性能。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个框架来提高基于激光雷达的三维物体检测器对道路喷雾的鲁棒性。我们的方法使用一个先进的恶劣天气检测网络来过滤激光雷达点云中的喷雾，然后将其用作物体检测器的输入。通过这种方式，检测到的物体对场景中的恶劣天气影响较小，从而更准确地感知环境。除了恶劣天气过滤，我们还探索了使用雷达目标进一步过滤虚假检测的方法。对真实数据的测试表明，我们的方法改善了几种流行的三维物体检测器对道路喷雾的鲁棒性。",
