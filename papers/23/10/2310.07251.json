    "abstract": "In this position paper, we argue that instead of morally aligning LLMs to specific set of ethical principles, we should infuse generic ethical reasoning capabilities into them so that they can handle value pluralism at a global scale. When provided with an ethical policy, an LLM should be capable of making decisions that are ethically consistent to the policy. We develop a framework that integrates moral dilemmas with moral principles pertaining to different foramlisms of normative ethics, and at different levels of abstractions. Initial experiments with GPT-x models shows that while GPT-4 is a nearly perfect ethical reasoner, the models still have bias towards the moral values of Western and English speaking societies.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们认为与其对LLM进行道德对齐到特定的伦理原则，我们应该注入通用的伦理推理能力，使其能够处理全球范围的价值多元性。当提供伦理政策时，LLM应该能够做出与政策一致的伦理决策。我们开发了一个框架，将道德困境与不同形式的规范伦理以及不同抽象层次的道德原则相结合。对GPT-x模型的初步实验表明，虽然GPT-4几乎可以完美地进行伦理推理，但这些模型仍然存在对西方和以英语为母语的社会道德价值的偏见。",
