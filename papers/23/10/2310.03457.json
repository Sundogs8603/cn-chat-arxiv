Recently, counterfactual reasoning has gained increasing attention in medical research because of its ability to provide a refined visual explanatory map. However, such visual explanatory maps based on visual inspection alone are insufficient unless we intuitively demonstrate their medical or neuroscientific validity via quantitative features. In this study, we synthesize the counterfactual-labeled structural MRIs using our proposed framework and transform it into a gray matter density map to measure its volumetric changes over the parcellated region of interest (ROI). We also devised a lightweight linear classifier to boost the effectiveness of constructed ROIs, promoted quantitative interpretation, and achieved comparable predictive performance to DL methods.

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习（DL）对于预测阿尔茨海默病（AD）已经在疾病进展的及时干预方面提供了帮助，但仍然需要注意可解释性，以解释他们的DL模型如何做出明确的决策。最近，反事实推理在医学研究中得到了越来越多的关注，因为它能够提供一个细致的可视化解释图。然而，仅凭视觉检查和视觉解释图是不够的，除非我们通过定量特征直观地证明它们在医学或神经科学上的有效性。在本研究中，我们使用我们提出的框架合成了反事实标记的结构性MRIs，并将其转化为灰质密度图，以测量其在兴趣区域（ROI）的体积变化。我们还设计了一个轻量级线性分类器来提高构建的ROI的效果，促进定量解释，并实现与DL方法相当的预测性能。",
