    "translated_abstract": "卫星图像的分割在遥感应用中至关重要。现有方法在卫星图像的语义分割中面临识别小尺度目标的挑战，主要原因是忽略了底层网络的低级特征和由不同特征图包含不同数量信息。因此，在本研究中，提出了一种基于三级注意力的DeepLabv3+架构（DeepTriNet）用于卫星图像的语义分割。所提出的混合方法结合了挤压激励网络（SENets）和三级注意力单元（TAUs）与普通的DeepLabv3+架构，其中TAUs用于弥合编解码器输出与SENets用于给相关特征分配更多权重之间的语义特征差距。所提出的DeepTriNet通过自我监督找到哪些特征是更相关且更通用的，而不是我们对它们进行注释。研究表明，所提出的DeepTriNet具有较好的性能。",
