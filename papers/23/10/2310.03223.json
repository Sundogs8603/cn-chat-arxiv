    "abstract": "We seek to automate the generation of drug-like compounds conditioned to specific protein pocket targets. Most current methods approximate the protein-molecule distribution of a finite dataset and, therefore struggle to generate molecules with significant binding improvement over the training dataset. We instead frame the pocket-conditioned molecular generation task as an RL problem and develop TacoGFN, a target conditional Generative Flow Network model. Our method is explicitly encouraged to generate molecules with desired properties as opposed to fitting on a pre-existing data distribution. To this end, we develop transformer-based docking score prediction to speed up docking score computation and propose TacoGFN to explore molecule space efficiently. Furthermore, we incorporate several rounds of active learning where generated samples are queried using a docking oracle to improve the docking score prediction. This approach allows us to accurately explore as much of the molecule land",

    "translated_abstract": "我们旨在自动化生成符合特定蛋白质口袋目标的类药物化合物。大多数当前方法是对有限数据集中的蛋白质-分子分布进行近似，因此在生成的分子中很难实现与训练数据集相比具有显著结合改善的分子。我们将口袋条件下的分子生成任务定义为强化学习问题，并开发了TacoGFN，一种目标条件下的生成流网络模型。我们的方法明确鼓励生成具有期望属性的分子，而不是适应预先存在的数据分布。为此，我们开发了基于转换器的对接得分预测方法来加快对接得分计算，并提出了TacoGFN来高效地探索分子空间。此外，我们还结合了几轮主动学习，使用对接神经网络对生成的样本进行查询，以改善对接得分预测。这种方法使我们能够准确地探索更多的分子空间。",
