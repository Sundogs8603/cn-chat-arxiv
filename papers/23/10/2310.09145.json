    "abstract": "This paper is an update of the survey of AI accelerators and processors from past four years, which is now called the Lincoln AI Computing Survey - LAICS (pronounced \"lace\"). As in past years, this paper collects and summarizes the current commercial accelerators that have been publicly announced with peak performance and peak power consumption numbers. The performance and power values are plotted on a scatter graph, and a number of dimensions and observations from the trends on this plot are again discussed and analyzed. Market segments are highlighted on the scatter plot, and zoomed plots of each segment are also included. Finally, a brief description of each of the new accelerators that have been added in the survey this year is included.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文是AI加速器和处理器调查的更新，涵盖过去四年的内容，现在称为Lincoln AI计算调查 - LAICS（发音为“lace”）。与往年一样，本文收集并总结了目前已公开宣布的商用加速器的峰值性能和峰值功耗数据。将性能和功耗数值绘制在散点图上，并再次讨论和分析了该图上的趋势的多个维度和观察结果。在散点图上突出显示了市场细分，并包括每个细分的缩放图。最后，还包括了对本年度调查中新增加的每个加速器的简要描述。",
