    "abstract": "Research in psychopathology has shown that, at an aggregate level, the patterns of emotional change over time -- emotion dynamics -- are indicators of one's mental health. One's patterns of emotion change have traditionally been determined through self-reports of emotions; however, there are known issues with accuracy, bias, and convenience. Recent approaches to determining emotion dynamics from one's everyday utterances, addresses many of these concerns, but it is not yet known whether these measures of utterance emotion dynamics (UED) correlate with mental health diagnoses. Here, for the first time, we study the relationship between tweet emotion dynamics and mental health disorders. We find that each of the UED metrics studied varied by the user's self-disclosed diagnosis. For example: average valence was significantly higher (i.e., more positive text) in the control group compared to users with ADHD, MDD, and PTSD. Valence variability was significantly lower in the control group co",

    "translated_abstract": "心理病理学研究表明，情绪随时间的变化模式——情绪动态——是心理健康的指标。传统上，情绪变化的模式是通过情绪的自我报告来确定的；然而，已知存在准确性、偏见和便利性等问题。最近的方法通过研究个人日常发言来确定情绪动态，解决了许多这些问题，但目前尚不清楚这些发言情绪动态的测量值是否与心理健康诊断相关。在这里，我们首次研究了推文情绪动态与心理健康障碍之间的关系。我们发现，我们研究的每个情绪动态度量值都因用户自我披露的诊断而有所变化。例如，平均情绪价值较高（即文本较积极）的控制组与患有注意力缺陷多动障碍（ADHD）、抑郁症（MDD）和创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的用户相比显著较高。情绪价值变异性在控制组中显著较低。",
