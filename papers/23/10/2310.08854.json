    "abstract": "Modern detection transformers (DETRs) use a set of object queries to predict a list of bounding boxes, sort them by their classification confidence scores, and select the top-ranked predictions as the final detection results for the given input image. A highly performant object detector requires accurate ranking for the bounding box predictions. For DETR-based detectors, the top-ranked bounding boxes suffer from less accurate localization quality due to the misalignment between classification scores and localization accuracy, thus impeding the construction of high-quality detectors. In this work, we introduce a simple and highly performant DETR-based object detector by proposing a series of rank-oriented designs, combinedly called Rank-DETR. Our key contributions include: (i) a rank-oriented architecture design that can prompt positive predictions and suppress the negative ones to ensure lower false positive rates, as well as (ii) a rank-oriented loss function and matching cost design ",

    "translated_abstract": "现代检测变换器（DETR）使用一组对象查询来预测边界框列表，通过将其分类置信度得分进行排序，并选择排名靠前的预测结果作为给定输入图像的最终检测结果。性能卓越的目标检测器需要对边界框预测进行准确的排序。对于基于DETR的检测器，排名靠前的边界框由于分类得分与定位准确性之间的不对齐而导致定位质量较差，从而阻碍了高质量检测器的构建。在这项工作中，我们通过提出一系列面向排名的设计，共同称为Rank-DETR，引入了一个简单且性能卓越的基于DETR的目标检测器。我们的主要贡献包括：（i）一个面向排名的架构设计，可以促进正面预测并抑制负面预测，以确保更低的假阳性率，以及（ii）一个面向排名的损失函数和匹配成本设计。",
