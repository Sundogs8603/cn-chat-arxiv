    "abstract": "Releasing court decisions to the public relies on proper anonymization to protect all involved parties, where necessary. The Swiss Federal Supreme Court relies on an existing system that combines different traditional computational methods with human experts. In this work, we enhance the existing anonymization software using a large dataset annotated with entities to be anonymized. We compared BERT-based models with models pre-trained on in-domain data. Our results show that using in-domain data to pre-train the models further improves the F1-score by more than 5\\% compared to existing models. Our work demonstrates that combining existing anonymization methods, such as regular expressions, with machine learning can further reduce manual labor and enhance automatic suggestions.",

    "translated_abstract": "将法院的裁决公开需要进行适当的匿名化，以保护所有相关方的隐私。瑞士联邦最高法院依靠一种已有的系统，将不同的传统计算方法与人工专家结合起来。在这项工作中，我们利用一个带有要匿名化实体注释的大型数据集，增强了现有的匿名化软件。我们比较了基于BERT的模型和在领域内预训练的模型。结果显示，使用领域内数据来预训练模型相比现有模型进一步提高了F1分数超过5％。我们的工作表明，将现有的匿名化方法（如正则表达式）与机器学习相结合，可以进一步减少人工劳动并增强自动建议的能力。",
