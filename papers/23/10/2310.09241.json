    "translated_abstract": "法律判决预测（LJP）已成为法律人工智能中一个越来越关键的任务，即根据案件事实描述预测案件的判决。先例是具有相似事实的先前法律案例，它们是国家法律体系中后续案件判决的依据。因此，值得探索在LJP中利用先例的方法。深度学习的最新进展使得可以使用各种技术来解决LJP任务。这些技术可以分为两类：大型语言模型（LLM）和领域特定模型。LLM能够解释和生成复杂的自然语言，而领域模型在学习任务特定信息方面效果显著。在本文中，我们提出了先例增强的LJP框架（PLJP），这是一个在先例背景下利用LLM和领域模型优势的系统。具体来说，领域模型的设计目标是提供候选标签并找到适当的预测标签。",
