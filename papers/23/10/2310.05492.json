    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) with enormous pre-training tokens and parameter amounts emerge abilities, including math reasoning, code generation, and instruction following.

It is important to investigate how to unlock them with multiple abilities via SFT. In this study, we specifically focus on the data composition between mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general human-aligning abilities during SFT. From a scaling perspective, we investigate the relationship between model abilities and various factors including data amounts, data composition ratio, model parameters, and SFT strategies. Our experiments reveal that different abilities exhibit different scaling patterns, and larger models generally show superior performance with the same amount of data.

    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLMs）具备大量的预训练标记和参数，展现出数学推理、代码生成和指令跟随等能力。这些能力通过监督微调（SFT）进一步增强。开源社区已经研究了针对每种能力的临时SFT，而专有LLMs可以适用于所有能力。因此，研究如何通过SFT解锁多重能力变得重要。在本研究中，我们特别关注SFT过程中数学推理、代码生成和人类对齐能力之间的数据组合。从规模的角度，我们研究了模型能力与各种因素之间的关系，包括数据量、数据组合比例、模型参数和SFT策略。我们的实验发现不同的能力表现出不同的扩展模式，较大的模型通常在相同的数据量下表现出更优异的性能。数学推理和代码生成能力通过微调数据和模型参数的增加而获得显著的性能提升。",
