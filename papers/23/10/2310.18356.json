    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）已经改变了人工智能的格局，但其庞大的规模在计算成本方面带来了重大挑战。我们引入了LoRAShear，一种新颖的高效方法，用于结构化剪枝LLMs并恢复知识。LoRAShear首先在LoRA模块上创建依赖图，以发现最小删除结构并分析知识分布。然后，它在LoRA适配器上进行渐进式结构剪枝，并实现内在的知识转移，以更好地保留冗余结构中的信息。为了恢复剪枝期间丢失的知识，LoRAShear仔细研究并提出了一种动态微调方案，使用动态数据适配器，以有效缩小与完整模型的性能差距。数值结果表明，只使用一块GPU在几天内，LoRAShear将LLMs的占用空间有效减少了20%，仅有1.0%的性能损失。",
