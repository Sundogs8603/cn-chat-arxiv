    "translated_abstract": "在一个无法缺少符号数学方程来建模复杂自然现象的时代，科学探究往往涉及到收集观察数据并将其转化为数学表达式。最近，深度学习已经成为从数据中提取洞察力的强大工具。然而，现有模型通常特化于数值领域或符号领域，并且通常在为特定任务量身定制的监督式训练中进行训练。这种方法忽视了符号方程和其数值对应物之间可能产生的重大好处。为了弥合这种差距，我们引入了SNIP，一种符号-数值集成预训练的方法，它通过在符号和数值领域之间进行联合对比学习，增强了它们在预训练嵌入中的相互相似性。通过进行潜空间分析，我们观察到SNIP提供了跨领域的表示洞察力，揭示了符号和数值之间的关联关系。",
