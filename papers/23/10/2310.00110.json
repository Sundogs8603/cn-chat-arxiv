    "translated_abstract": "基于机器学习方法的代理模型已成为现代工程的重要组成部分，用以取代昂贵的计算机模拟。创建代理模型所使用的数据对于模型的准确性至关重要，但往往受到成本和时间限制的限制。自适应采样策略已被证明可以减少创建准确模型所需的样本数量。本文提出了一种新的全局拟合采样策略，称为Gradient and Uncertainty Enhanced Sequential Sampling (GUESS)。采用两个术语的收购功能：用于探索未见区域的代理模型的预测后验不确定性及用于开发的二阶及更高阶泰勒展开值的加权逼近值。尽管迄今为止已提出了各种采样策略，但选择合适的方法并不容易。因此，我们将我们提出的策略与基于26个不同统计学和机器学习方法的9种自适应采样策略进行了比较。",
