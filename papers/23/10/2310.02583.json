    "abstract": "With their unique combination of characteristics - an energy density almost 100 times that of human muscle, and a power density of 5.3 kW/kg, similar to a jet engine's output - Nylon artificial muscles stand out as particularly apt for robotics applications. However, the necessity of integrating sensors and controllers poses a limitation to their practical usage. Here we report a constant power open-loop controller based on machine learning. We show that we can control the position of a nylon artificial muscle without external sensors. To this end, we construct a mapping from a desired displacement trajectory to a required power using an ensemble encoder-style feed-forward neural network. The neural controller is carefully trained on a physics-based denoised dataset and can be fine-tuned to accommodate various types of thermal artificial muscles, irrespective of the presence or absence of hysteresis.",

    "translated_abstract": "尼龙人工肌肉具有独特的特性，能量密度几乎是人类肌肉的100倍，功率密度为5.3 kW/kg，类似于喷气发动机的输出，因此特别适用于机器人应用。然而，集成传感器和控制器的必要性对其实际使用造成了限制。本研究提出了基于机器学习的恒功率开环控制器。我们展示了在没有外部传感器的情况下，我们可以控制尼龙人工肌肉的位置。为此，我们使用集成编码器式前馈神经网络构建了一个从期望位移轨迹到所需功率的映射。神经控制器在基于物理的去噪数据集上经过精心训练，并可以进行微调以适应各种类型的热人工肌肉，无论是否存在滞后现象。",
