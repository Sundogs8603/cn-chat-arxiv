    "abstract": "We present a novel quasi-Monte Carlo mechanism to improve graph-based sampling, coined repelling random walks. By inducing correlations between the trajectories of an interacting ensemble such that their marginal transition probabilities are unmodified, we are able to explore the graph more efficiently, improving the concentration of statistical estimators whilst leaving them unbiased. The mechanism has a trivial drop-in implementation. We showcase the effectiveness of repelling random walks in a range of settings including estimation of graph kernels, the PageRank vector and graphlet concentrations. We provide detailed experimental evaluation and robust theoretical guarantees. To our knowledge, repelling random walks constitute the first rigorously studied quasi-Monte Carlo scheme correlating the directions of walkers on a graph, inviting new research in this exciting nascent domain.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的准蒙特卡罗机制来改进基于图的抽样，称为抵制随机游走。通过在一个相互作用的集合中的轨迹之间引入相关性，使它们的边际转移概率保持不变，我们能够更有效地探索图，提高统计估计器的集中度，同时保持其无偏性。这个机制有一个简单的插入实现方式。我们展示了抵制随机游走在一系列设置中的有效性，包括图核的估计、PageRank向量和图元浓度。我们提供了详细的实验评估和稳健的理论保证。据我们所知，抵制随机游走是首个在图上相关行走方向的准蒙特卡罗方案进行了严谨研究，为这个令人兴奋的新兴领域开展新的研究提供了契机。",
