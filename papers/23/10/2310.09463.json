    "translated_abstract": "一个良好的大型复杂移动机器人工作空间的表示必须是空间高效的，同时能够编码相关的几何细节。当探索未知环境时，它需要以在线增量方式进行更新。我们引入了HIO-SDF，一种将环境表示为有符号距离场（SDF）的新方法。目前SDF的最先进表示基于神经网络或体素网格。神经网络能够连续地表示SDF。然而，它们很难以增量方式进行更新，因为神经网络往往会忘记之前观察到的环境部分，除非存储了大量的传感器历史用于训练。基于体素的表示不具有这个问题，但在细节丰富的大型环境中不是空间高效的。HIO-SDF利用层次方法结合了这些表示的优势，使用粗糙的体素网格捕捉观测到的环境部分。",
