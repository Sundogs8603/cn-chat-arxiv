    "translated_abstract": "由于强大的深度表示学习，自动化医学图像分割取得了很大的进展。Transformer的影响导致了对其变体的研究，并大规模替代传统的CNN模块。然而，这种趋势经常忽视了Transformer的固有特征提取能力以及通过微小调整对模型和Transformer模块的潜在改进。本研究提出了一种新颖的深度医学图像分割框架，称为DA-TransUNet，旨在将Transformer和双重注意块引入传统U形架构的编码器和解码器中。与之前基于Transformer的解决方案不同，我们的DA-TransUNet利用了Transformer的注意机制和DA-Block的多方面特征提取，可以有效地结合全局、局部和多尺度特征以增强医学图像分割。同时，实验结果表明在之前的Transformer U-Net的基础上添加了一个双重注意块。",
