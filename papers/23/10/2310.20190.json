    "abstract": "Several visual tasks, such as pedestrian detection and image-to-image translation, are challenging to accomplish in low light using RGB images. Heat variation of objects in thermal images can be used to overcome this. In this work, an end-to-end framework, which consists of a generative network and a detector network, is proposed to translate RGB image into Thermal ones and compare generated thermal images with real data. We have collected images from two different locations using the Parrot Anafi Thermal drone. After that, we created a two-stream network, preprocessed, augmented, the image data, and trained the generator and discriminator models from scratch. The findings demonstrate that it is feasible to translate RGB training data to thermal data using GAN. As a result, thermal data can now be produced more quickly and affordably, which is useful for security and surveillance applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "在低光条件下，通过使用可见光图像很难完成一些视觉任务，如行人检测和图像翻译。热红外图像中物体的热变化可以用来克服这个问题。本文提出了一个端到端的框架，包括一个生成网络和一个检测网络，用于将可见光图像翻译成热红外图像，并将生成的热红外图像与真实数据进行比较。我们使用Parrot Anafi Thermal无人机在两个不同位置收集了图像。然后，我们创建了一个双流网络，对图像数据进行了预处理、增强，从头开始训练了生成器和鉴别器模型。研究结果表明，使用GAN将可见光训练数据转换为热红外数据是可行的。因此，现在可以更快速、更经济地生成热红外数据，这对于安防和监控应用非常有用。",
