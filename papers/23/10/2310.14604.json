    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to financial risk assessment by incorporating topological data analysis (TDA), specifically cohomology groups, into the evaluation of derivatives portfolios. The study aims to go beyond traditional risk measures like Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), offering a more nuanced understanding of market complexities. Using both simulated and real-world data, we develop a new topological risk measure, termed Density Change Under Stress (DCUS). Preliminary results indicate a significant change in the density of the point cloud representing the financial time series during stress conditions, suggesting that DCUS may offer additional insights into portfolio risk and has the potential to complement existing risk management tools.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过将拓扑数据分析（TDA），特别是上同调群，纳入衍生品组合评估中，引入了一种新的金融风险评估方法。该研究旨在超越传统的风险度量方法，如风险值（VaR）和条件风险值（CVaR），以便更深入地理解市场复杂性。利用模拟和真实数据，我们开发了一种新的拓扑风险度量方法，称为压力下密度变化（DCUS）。初步结果表明，在压力条件下，代表金融时间序列的点云密度出现显著变化，这表明DCUS可能提供额外的投资组合风险洞察，并有潜力补充现有的风险管理工具。",
