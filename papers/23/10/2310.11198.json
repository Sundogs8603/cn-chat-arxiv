This approach is contrary to previous works which only investigate one attention mechanism and usually build a very complex, sometimes nested architecture.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究的目标是探讨在大脑-计算机接口（BCI）领域中应用各种通道关注机制于运动意向解码。通道关注机制可以视为传统用于运动意向解码的空间滤波器的强大演进。本研究通过将这些机制整合到一个轻量级架构框架中，系统地比较它们的影响。我们精心构建了一个简单而轻量级的基准架构，旨在无缝集成不同的通道关注机制。这种方法与之前的研究相反，之前的研究只研究一个关注机制，并且通常构建一个非常复杂、有时嵌套的架构。我们的框架使我们能够在相同情况下评估和比较不同的关注机制的影响。易于集成不同的通道关注机制以及低计算复杂度使我们能够高效地研究和推进BCI中的运动意向解码。",
