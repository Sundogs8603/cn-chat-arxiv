    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）使得多个医疗机构能够在隐私保护的前提下，共同训练深度学习（DL）模型。然而，在小型机构中，标记数据的有限可用性和异构的数据分布（即非i.i.d.）可能限制FL的性能。虽然数据增强被证明是提高传统集中式DL泛化能力的有效技术，但其在FL中的应用尚未得到充分探索。值得注意的是，受到昂贵的标注成本的限制，3D医学分割通常依赖于数据增强。在本文中，我们旨在开发一种邻近特征层级数据增强（VFDA）方案，以有效减轻局部特征漂移，并促进隐私感知的FL分割的协同训练。我们考虑了内部和跨机构的差异，而无需跨机构转移原始数据或混合数据。",
