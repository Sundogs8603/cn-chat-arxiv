    "translated_abstract": "在医疗领域，电子健康记录（EHR）是开发诊断、治疗和管理医疗资源的机器学习模型的关键训练数据。然而，医疗数据集在种族/民族、性别和年龄等敏感属性方面往往存在不平衡。在类不平衡的EHR数据集上训练的机器学习模型在部署时，对于少数群体的个体而言，表现显著不如多数群体的样本，这可能导致少数群体的不公平医疗结果。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种名为Minority Class Rebalancing through Augmentation by Generative modeling (MCRAGE)的新方法，通过由深度生成模型生成的样本来增强不平衡的数据集。MCRAGE过程包括训练一个能够从少数群体中产生高质量合成EHR样本的条件去噪扩散概率模型（CDDPM）。",
