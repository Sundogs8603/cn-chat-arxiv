    "translated_abstract": "在过去的五年中，生成式和基础性人工智能系统的使用极大地提高了对大脑活动的解码能力。特别是对于视觉知觉，现在可以从功能性磁共振成像（fMRI）中解码出令人瞩目的准确度。然而，这种神经影像技术的时间分辨率有限（约为0.5 Hz），因此在实时应用方面存在根本性的限制。在这里，我们提出了一种基于脑磁图（MEG）的替代方法，这是一种能够以高时间分辨率（约为5000 Hz）测量脑活动的神经影像设备。为此，我们开发了一个MEG解码模型，该模型通过对比和回归目标进行训练，并由三个模块组成：i）从图像中获得的预训练嵌入、ii）端到端训练的MEG模块以及iii）预训练的图像生成器。我们的结果有三个方面：首先，我们的MEG解码器在经典线性解码器上显示出7倍的图像检索改进。其次，后期脑部",
