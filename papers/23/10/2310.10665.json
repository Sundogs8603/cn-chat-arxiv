    "translated_abstract": "元宇宙是一个新兴概念，它设想了一个虚拟宇宙，一个协作空间，个体可以在其中互动、创造和参与各种活动。随着这个概念的发展和沉浸式虚拟体验的普及，元宇宙中的隐私成为一个重要问题。元宇宙隐私问题指的是在虚拟现实（VR）环境中的个人信息和数据隐私面临的挑战和关切，因为共享的VR空间概念变得更加可接近。元宇宙将借助人工智能（AI）、扩展现实（XR）、混合现实（MR）和基于5G/6G通信的技术进步，为用户提供个性化和沉浸式服务。此外，为了实现更个性化的体验，元宇宙依赖于收集精细化的用户数据，这导致了各种隐私问题。因此，在完全实现元宇宙的潜力之前，隐私保护是非常重要的。",
    "tldr": "这项调研讨论了在人工智能与扩展现实元宇宙中的隐私保护问题。作为一个新兴概念，元宇宙的隐私问题令人担忧，特别是在沉浸式虚拟体验变得越来越普及的情况下。元宇宙将利用多种技术进行发展，并收集用户数据来提供个性化和沉浸式的服务，但这也引发了隐私问题的关注。",
