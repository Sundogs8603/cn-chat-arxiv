    "translated_abstract": "零射命令对象导航（ZSON）使代理能够在未知环境中导航到开放词汇对象。现有的ZSON工作主要集中在遵循个别指令以寻找通用对象类，忽略了自然语言交互的利用和识别用户特定对象的复杂性。为了解决这些局限性，我们引入了零射交互个性化对象导航（ZIPON），其中机器人需要在与用户对话的同时导航到个性化目标对象。为了解决ZIPON问题，我们提出了一种新的框架称为开放世界互动个性化导航（ORION），该框架使用大型语言模型（LLM）进行序列决策，以操作不同的感知、导航和通信模块。实验结果表明，能够利用用户反馈的互动代理的性能有了显著改进。然而，在任务完成和用户满意度之间取得良好的平衡仍然具有挑战性。",
