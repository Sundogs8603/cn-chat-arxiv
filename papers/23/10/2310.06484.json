    "translated_abstract": "顺序位置推荐在现代生活中起着重要作用，可以增强用户体验，给企业带来更多的利润并协助政府行政工作。尽管随着推荐系统的发展，位置推荐的方法已经有了显著进步，但地理信息的利用仍然有限，同时还面临着解决数据稀疏性的挑战。为此，我们引入了一种基于近邻感知的顺序推荐区域表示方法（简称PASR），该方法基于自注意力网络架构构建。我们通过使用重要性抽样的创新损失函数来解决稀疏性问题，在优化过程中强调信息丰富的负样本。此外，PASR通过在每个GPS点的分层网格和近邻网格中使用基于自注意力的地理编码器来增强地理信息的整合。为进一步利用地理信息，我们使用近邻网格和POI类别的部分注意力编码器进行位置向量的构建。",
