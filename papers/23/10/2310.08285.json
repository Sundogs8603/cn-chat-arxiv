    "translated_abstract": "移动即服务（MaaS）通过整合不同的交通方式，提供无缝的门对门出行。虽然近年来出现了许多MaaS平台，但大多数仍处于有限的整合水平。本研究探讨了MaaS平台作为中介者在多模式交通网络中的分配和定价问题，该平台从服务运营商购买能力，并向旅行者销售多模式行程。我们采用了多对多稳定匹配的分析框架来分解联合设计问题，并得出稳定条件，使运营商和旅行者愿意参与MaaS系统。为了最大限度地提高路径选择的灵活性并消除模式之间的边界，我们设计了一种适用于MaaS行程的起点-终点定价方案。在供应端，我们提出了一种用于服务能力的批发购买价格。因此，分配问题被重新定义和解决为一个双层规划问题，其中MaaS tra",
