    "translated_abstract": "遥感数据中LULC类别通常存在混合情况，光谱分离是一种从混合像素中提取信息到其组成LULC类型和相应丰度分数的技术。传统上，解决这一任务要么依赖于需要先验知识的经典方法，要么依赖于避免显式成分计算的机器学习方法，也就是盲目光谱分离（BSU）。大多数基于深度学习（DL）的BSU研究侧重于单个时间步的高光谱数据，然而与多光谱数据相比，其获取成本仍然相当高昂。据我们所知，我们在这里提供了第一项关于使用多光谱时间序列数据和DL模型进行LULC类别的BSU研究。我们进一步通过添加地理加地形（geo-topographic）和气候辅助信息来提升基于长短时记忆（LSTM）的模型的性能。我们的实验结果表明，将光谱时间输入数据与地理时态数据相结合可以提高模型性能。",
