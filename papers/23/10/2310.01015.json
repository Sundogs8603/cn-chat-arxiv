    "abstract": "While numerous public blockchain datasets are available, their utility is constrained by a singular focus on blockchain data. This constraint limits the incorporation of relevant social network data into blockchain analysis, thereby diminishing the breadth and depth of insight that can be derived. To address the above limitation, we introduce ETGraph, a novel dataset that authentically links Ethereum and Twitter, marking the first and largest dataset of its kind. ETGraph combines Ethereum transaction records (2 million nodes and 30 million edges) and Twitter following data (1 million nodes and 3 million edges), bonding 30,667 Ethereum addresses with verified Twitter accounts sourced from OpenSea. Detailed statistical analysis on ETGraph highlights the structural differences between Twitter-matched and non-Twitter-matched Ethereum addresses. Extensive experiments, including Ethereum link prediction, wash-trading Ethereum addresses detection, and Twitter-Ethereum matching link prediction",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管有大量的公共区块链数据集可用，但它们的效用受限于对区块链数据的单一关注。这种限制限制了相关社交网络数据与区块链分析的结合，从而减少了可以得出的广度和深度洞见。为了解决以上限制，我们介绍了ETGraph，它是一个全新的数据集，真实地连接了以太坊和Twitter，是其类别中第一个且最大的数据集。ETGraph结合了以太坊的交易记录（200万个节点和3000万条边）和Twitter的关注数据（100万个节点和300万条边），将30667个以太坊地址与来自OpenSea的已验证Twitter账户进行了绑定。对ETGraph的详细统计分析突出了与Twitter匹配和非Twitter匹配的以太坊地址之间的结构差异。包括以太坊链路预测、虚假交易以太坊地址检测和Twitter-以太坊匹配链路预测在内的大量实验",
