    "abstract": "Context: Machine Learning (ML) is integrated into a growing number of systems for various applications. Because the performance of an ML model is highly dependent on the quality of the data it has been trained on, there is a growing interest in approaches to detect and repair data errors (i.e., data cleaning). Researchers are also exploring how ML can be used for data cleaning; hence creating a dual relationship between ML and data cleaning. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that comprehensively reviews this relationship. Objective: This paper's objectives are twofold. First, it aims to summarize the latest approaches for data cleaning for ML and ML for data cleaning. Second, it provides future work recommendations. Method: We conduct a systematic literature review of the papers published between 2016 and 2022 inclusively. We identify different types of data cleaning activities with and for ML: feature cleaning, label cleaning, entity matching, outlier detection, imputati",

    "translated_abstract": "背景：机器学习（ML）被整合到越来越多的系统中，用于各种应用。由于ML模型的性能高度依赖于其训练数据的质量，因此对于检测和修复数据错误（即数据清洗）的方法越来越受关注。研究人员还在探索如何使用ML进行数据清洗，从而在ML和数据清洗之间构建了双重关系。据我们所知，尚无对这种关系进行全面综述的研究。目标：本文的目标有两个。首先，总结了最新的数据清洗方法，包括ML用于数据清洗和数据清洗用于ML。其次，提出了未来的工作建议。方法：我们对2016年至2022年期间发表的论文进行了系统性文献综述。我们确定了不同类型的数据清洗活动，包括特征清洗、标签清洗、实体匹配、异常值检测、缺失数据填充等。",
