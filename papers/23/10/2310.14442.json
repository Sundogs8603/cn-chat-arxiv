    "abstract": "I study the relationship between diversity preferences and the choice rules implemented by institutions, with a particular focus on the affirmative action policies. I characterize the choice rules that can be rationalized by diversity preferences and demonstrate that the recently rescinded affirmative action mechanism used to allocate government positions in India cannot be rationalized. I show that if institutions evaluate diversity without considering intersectionality of identities, their choices cannot satisfy the crucial substitutes condition. I characterize choice rules that satisfy the substitutes condition and are rationalizable by preferences that are separable in diversity and match quality domains.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究多样性偏好与机构实施的选择规则之间的关系，尤其关注平权行动政策。我们表征了可以理解为多样性偏好的选择规则，并证明了印度政府职位分配中最近废止的平权行动机制无法理解。我们还指出，如果机构在评估多样性时不考虑身份的交叉性，它们的选择无法满足至关重要的替代条件。我们对满足替代条件并可由在多样性和匹配质量领域中可分离的偏好理解的选择规则进行了表征。",
