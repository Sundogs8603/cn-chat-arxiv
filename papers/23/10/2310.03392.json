    "translated_abstract": "在安全关键行业中确保高质量的人工智能与人类互动（HAII）是至关重要的。不能做到这一点可能导致灾难性和致命的后果。尽管如此紧迫，关于HAII的研究很少且零散，且缺乏一致性。我们在这里提出了对该领域的文献综述和改进研究最佳实践的建议。我们将我们的调查分为以下研究领域：（1）用于描述HAII的术语，（2）AI-enabled系统的主要角色，（3）影响HAII的因素，以及（4）如何衡量HAII。此外，我们描述了在这些文章中讨论的安全关键行业中使用的AI-enabled系统的能力和成熟度。我们发现在文献中没有一个术语被一致使用来描述HAII，而一些术语具有多个含义。根据我们的文献，有五个因素影响HAII：用户特征和背景（例如，用户个性，感知），AI界面和功能（例如，",

    "en_tdlr": "Ensuring quality human-AI interaction (HAII) in safety-critical industries is crucial, but current research on HAII is fragmented and lacks consistency. This paper presents a systematic literature review, finding that there is no consistent terminology for describing HAII and identifies five factors that influence HAII: user characteristics and background, AI interface and features, user trust, monitoring and feedback, and work team structure. These findings provide guidance for improving HAII in safety-critical industries."
