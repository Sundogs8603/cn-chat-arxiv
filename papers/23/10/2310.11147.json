As a direct measure of the shear-induced friction forces, an accurate prediction of the wall-shear stress can contribute to sustainability, conservation of resources, and carbon neutrality in civil aviation as well as enhanced medical treatment of vascular diseases and cancer. Despite such importance for our modern society, we still lack adequate experimental methods to capture the instantaneous wall-shear stress dynamics. In this contribution, we present a holistic approach that derives velocity and wall-shear stress fields with impressive spatial and temporal resolution from flow measurements using a deep optical flow estimator with physical knowledge.

    "translated_abstract": "来自流体在物体附近或内部移动的湍流的摩擦阻力在交通运输、公用事业基础设施、能源技术和人类健康等领域起着关键作用。作为剪切引起的摩擦力的直接测量，准确预测壁剪切应力可以促进民航的可持续发展、资源保护和碳中和，以及改进血管疾病和癌症的医疗治疗。尽管对现代社会如此重要，我们仍然缺乏足够的实验方法来捕捉瞬时壁剪切应力动力学。在这篇论文中，我们提出了一种整体方法，使用具有物理知识的深度光流估计器从流动测量中推导出具有令人印象深刻的空间和时间分辨率的速度和壁剪切应力场。使用合成和真实世界的实验数据证明了所推导流动量的有效性和物理正确性。",
