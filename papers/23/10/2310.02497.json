    "abstract": "Unlike other data modalities such as text and vision, speech does not lend itself to easy interpretation. While lay people can understand how to describe an image or sentence via perception, non-expert descriptions of speech often end at high-level demographic information, such as gender or age. In this paper, we propose a possible interpretable representation of speaker identity based on perceptual voice qualities (PQs). By adding gendered PQs to the pathology-focused Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) protocol, our PQ-based approach provides a perceptual latent space of the character of adult voices that is an intermediary of abstraction between high-level demographics and low-level acoustic, physical, or learned representations. Contrary to prior belief, we demonstrate that these PQs are hearable by ensembles of non-experts, and further demonstrate that the information encoded in a PQ-based representation is predictable by various speech representations.",

    "translated_abstract": "与文本和视觉等其他数据形式不同，语音不易解释。虽然普通人可以通过感知来描述图像或句子，但对于语音，非专业人士的描述通常仅限于高级别的人口统计信息，如性别或年龄。在本文中，我们提出了一种可能的基于感知声音特质（PQs）的可解释的说话者身份表示。通过将性别化的PQs添加到以病理为焦点的声音统一听觉感知评估（CAPE-V）协议中，我们的基于PQs的方法提供了一种成年人声音特征的感知潜在空间，它是高级别人口统计信息和低级别声学、物理或学习表示之间的中间层抽象。与先前的观点相反，我们证明了这些PQs是可以通过非专业人员的观察听到的，并进一步证明了在基于PQs的表示中编码的信息是可以通过各种语音表示来预测的。",
