    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究发展了几种蒙特卡洛方法来估计归一化常数（配分函数），这些方法基于退火的思想。即从可计算的“提议”分布和未归一化的“目标”分布之间的路径逐步采样。这些家族中的重要估计器包括退火重要性抽样和退火噪声对比估计（NCE）。这样的方法依赖于许多设计选择：使用哪个估计器、使用哪个分布路径以及是否使用分布路径；到目前为止，对于哪些选择是有效的还没有明确的理论。在这里，我们通过产生的渐近估计误差来评估每个设计选择。首先，我们证明了使用NCE比重要性抽样估计器更有效，但在无限小的路径步长的极限下，差异消失了。第二，我们发现使用几何路径将估计误差从指数级降低到...",
