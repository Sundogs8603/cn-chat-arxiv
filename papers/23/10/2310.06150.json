    "translated_abstract": "机器学习，尤其是深度生成模型的运用，为合成DNA序列生成领域打开了新的前景。虽然生成对抗网络（GANs）在这个应用中得到了广泛应用，但它们常常面临样本多样性有限和模式崩溃等问题。另一方面，扩散模型是一类有前景的新型生成模型，不受这些问题的困扰，使其能够在图像生成等领域达到最先进水平。基于此，我们提出了一种新颖的适用于离散DNA序列生成的潜在扩散模型DiscDiff。通过将离散DNA序列简单地嵌入到连续的潜在空间中使用自编码器，我们能够利用连续扩散模型的强大生成能力来生成离散数据。此外，我们引入了一种新的度量标准——Fr\\'echet重建距离（FReD），用于评估DNA序列生成的样本质量。",
