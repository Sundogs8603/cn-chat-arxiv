    "abstract": "Afghanistan has witnessed many armed conflicts throughout history, especially in the past 20 years; these events have had a significant impact on human lives, including military and civilians, with potential fatalities. In this research, we aim to leverage state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to classify the outcomes of Afghanistan armed conflicts to either fatal or non-fatal based on their textual descriptions provided by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) dataset. The dataset contains comprehensive descriptions of armed conflicts in Afghanistan that took place from August 2021 to March 2023. The proposed approach leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a cutting-edge language representation model in natural language processing. The classifier utilizes the raw textual description of an event to estimate the likelihood of the event resulting in a fatality. The model achieved impressive performance on the test ",

    "translated_abstract": "阿富汗在历史上经历了许多武装冲突，尤其是在过去的20年中；这些事件对人类生活产生了重大影响，包括军事人员和平民，可能导致死亡。在这项研究中，我们旨在利用最先进的机器学习技术，根据由武装冲突位置和事件数据项目（ACLED）数据集提供的文本描述，对阿富汗武装冲突的结果进行分类，判断其是否致命。该数据集包含从2021年8月至2023年3月在阿富汗发生的武装冲突的详细描述。提出的方法利用了BERT（双向编码器转换器的双向编码器表示），这是自然语言处理中的先进语言表示模型。分类器利用事件的原始文本描述来估计事件导致死亡的可能性。该模型在测试集上取得了令人印象深刻的性能。",
