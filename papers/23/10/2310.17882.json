    "translated_abstract": "随着对分布式能源资源（DER）部署日益增加的兴趣，虚拟电厂（VPP）已成为汇集各种DER并促进其参与批发能源市场的关键工具。这些VPP部署得到了联邦能源监管委员会第2222号命令的推动，该命令使DER和VPP在市场领域具有竞争力。然而，DER的多样性和分散性质给VPP资产的可扩展协调带来了显著挑战。为了解决效率和速度瓶颈，本文提出了一种新颖的机器学习辅助的分布式优化方法来协调VPP资产。我们的方法名为LOOP-MAC（为多智能体协调优化过程学习优化），采用多智能体协调视角，每个VPP代理管理多个DER并利用神经网络逼近器加速解决方案搜索。LOOP-MAC方法使用一个测量图确保了最佳解之间的关系。",
