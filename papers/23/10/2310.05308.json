    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了对组合多臂老虎机（CMAB）的奖励污染攻击。我们首先给出了CMAB攻击可能性的充分必要条件，该条件取决于相应CMAB实例的内在特性，如超臂的奖励分布和基本臂的结果分布。此外，我们设计了适用于可攻击CMAB实例的攻击算法。与以往对多臂老虎机的理解相反，我们的研究揭示了一个令人惊讶的事实，即特定CMAB实例的攻击可能性还取决于发哥实例是否被对手知晓。这一发现表明，CMAB的对抗攻击在实践中很困难，并且不存在适用于任何CMAB实例的通用攻击策略，因为环境对于对手来说大部分是未知的。我们通过对实际CMAB应用（包括概率最大覆盖问题、在线最小生成树问题）的大量实验验证了我们的理论发现。",
