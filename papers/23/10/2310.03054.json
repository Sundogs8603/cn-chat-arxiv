    "abstract": "We propose conditional flows of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with the negative distance kernel for posterior sampling and conditional generative modeling. This MMD, which is also known as energy distance, has several advantageous properties like efficient computation via slicing and sorting. We approximate the joint distribution of the ground truth and the observations using discrete Wasserstein gradient flows and establish an error bound for the posterior distributions. Further, we prove that our particle flow is indeed a Wasserstein gradient flow of an appropriate functional. The power of our method is demonstrated by numerical examples including conditional image generation and inverse problems like superresolution, inpainting and computed tomography in low-dose and limited-angle settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了基于负距离核的最大平均距离(MMD)的条件流用于后验抽样和条件生成建模。这个MMD，也被称为能量距离，具有像通过切片和排序进行高效计算的几个有益属性。我们使用离散的Wasserstein梯度流来近似真实情况和观察值的联合分布，并为后验分布建立了误差界限。此外，我们证明了我们的粒子流确实是适当功能的Wasserstein梯度流。我们方法的能力通过数字示例进行了演示，包括条件图像生成和诸如超分辨率、修复和低剂量和有限角度设置下的计算机断层扫描等逆问题。",
