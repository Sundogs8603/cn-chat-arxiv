    "translated_abstract": "美学影响力是否与美不同？视觉显著性是否反映了其有效沟通的能力？我们提出了Impressions，这是一个新颖的数据集，通过它可以研究图像的符号学，以及特定的视觉特征和设计选择如何引发特定的情感、思维和信念。我们认为图像的影响力不仅仅在于美学的形式定义，而是在于其作为一种沟通行为的成功，其中风格对于意义形成的贡献与主题一样重要。然而，先前的图像描述数据集并不适合最先进的架构来模拟人类对图像的潜在印象或解读。为了填补这一空白，我们设计了一个受视觉艺术中图像分析技术启发的注释任务，收集了1,440个图像-标题对和4,320个独特的注释，探索影响力、实用图像描述、印象和美学设计选择。",

The research shows that the impactfulness of an image extends beyond formal definitions of aesthetics, but is closely related to its success as a communicative act."
