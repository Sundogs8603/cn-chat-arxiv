    "translated_abstract": "SCGAN在生成对抗网络中添加了一个相似性约束，将生成的图像与条件之间的相似性作为正则化项。相似性约束作为导师，指导生成器网络理解基于条件的表示差异。我们深入理解了SCGAN的工作原理。这种理解使我们意识到相似性约束的功能类似于对比损失函数。我们相信，具有高度理解和智能的模型可以根据图像的结构和高级特征来度量它们之间的相似性，就像人类一样。我们对SCGAN进行了两个主要改变，以创建一个改进的模型：使用SSIM来度量图像之间的相似性，并将对比损失原则应用于相似性约束。改进的模型在FID和FactorVAE指标下表现更好。与其他模型相比，改进的模型还具有更好的泛化能力。",
