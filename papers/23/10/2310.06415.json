    "translated_abstract": "化学工程中的过程综合是一个复杂的规划问题，由于庞大的搜索空间、连续参数和泛化的需求。近年来，没有先验知识的深度强化学习代理在各种复杂的规划问题中展现出超越人类的表现。现有的关于流程图综合的强化学习工作展示了有希望的概念，但侧重于单一化学系统中的狭窄问题，限制了其实用性。我们提出了一种用于流程图综合的通用深度强化学习方法。我们展示了单个代理在分离二元共沸混合物的一般任务中的适应性。在没有先验知识的情况下，它学会设计多个化学系统的接近最优的流程图，考虑不同的进料组成和概念方法。平均而言，该代理能将超过99％的材料分离为纯组分，并自主学习基本的过程工程师技能。",
