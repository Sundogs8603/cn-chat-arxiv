    "translated_abstract": "工业物联网系统中的在线感知和计算资源促进了基于AI的决策。然而，数据质量问题，如类别不平衡，阻碍了离线训练的AI模型。为了解决这个问题，AI模型会通过流式数据进行在线更新以持续改进。然而，由于注释约束，监督学习模型在选择用于更新的优质流式样本方面面临挑战。文献中的主动学习方法通过关注不足或过度表示的区域来提供解决方案。在不断变化的制造背景下平衡这些策略是具有挑战性的。AI学习到的一些获取准则可以动态适应，但可能无法始终处理频繁的变化。我们引入了一种集成主动学习方法CBEAL，专门利用主动学习代理进行探索或利用。代理的权重根据决策有效性进行调整。CBEAL可以优化地指导数据获取，实现数据效果的最小化。",
