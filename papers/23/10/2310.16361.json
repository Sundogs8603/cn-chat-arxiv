    "abstract": "E-commerce product catalogs contain billions of items. Most products have lengthy titles, as sellers pack them with product attributes to improve retrieval, and highlight key product aspects. This results in a gap between such unnatural products titles, and how customers refer to them. It also limits how e-commerce stores can use these seller-provided titles for recommendation, QA, or review summarization.  Inspired by recent work on instruction-tuned LLMs, we present InstructPTS, a controllable approach for the task of Product Title Summarization (PTS). Trained using a novel instruction fine-tuning strategy, our approach is able to summarize product titles according to various criteria (e.g. number of words in a summary, inclusion of specific phrases, etc.). Extensive evaluation on a real-world e-commerce catalog shows that compared to simple fine-tuning of LLMs, our proposed approach can generate more accurate product name summaries, with an improvement of over 14 and 8 BLEU and ROUG",

    "translated_abstract": "电子商务产品目录中包含数十亿个商品。大多数产品标题很长，卖家使用产品属性来改进商品检索并突出关键产品方面。这导致了不自然的产品标题与客户对其的称呼之间的差距。它也限制了电子商务商店使用这些卖家提供的标题进行推荐、问答或评论摘要的能力。受最近有关指导调节LLMs的研究的启示，我们提出了InstructPTS，这是一种用于产品标题摘要任务的可控方法。使用一种新的指导微调策略进行训练，我们的方法能够根据各种标准（例如摘要中的单词数量、包含特定短语等）总结产品标题。对实际电子商务目录进行广泛的评估表明，与简单微调LLMs相比，我们提出的方法可以生成更准确的产品名称摘要，BLEU和ROUG提高了超过14和8个百分点。",
