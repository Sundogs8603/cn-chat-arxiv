    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)在各种应用中展示了出色的指令跟随能力，并取得了令人瞩目的表现。然而，LLMs的性能严重依赖于给予它们的指令，这些指令通常需要大量人力进行手动调整。最近的研究使用了高效的贝叶斯优化（BO）算法来自动优化给予黑盒LLMs的指令。然而，在优化高度复杂（例如高维）的目标函数时，如将指令映射到LLM性能的函数，BO通常表现不佳。这主要是由于BO使用的高斯过程（GP）模型的表达能力有限，该模型被用作BO的代理来建模目标函数。与此同时，已经多次证明神经网络（NNs），尤其是预训练的转换器，具有很强的表达能力，可以建模高度复杂的函数。因此，我们采用了一种神经探测器算法。",
