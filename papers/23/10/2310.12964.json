    "translated_abstract": "预测集通过预测一组标签而不是个别标签来捕捉不确定性，使下游决策能够保守考虑所有可能的结果。符合性推断算法构建预测集，保证以高概率包含真实标签。这些保证在面对分布偏移时失效，而可靠的不确定性量化在这种情况下尤为有用。我们提出了一种新的算法，在标签偏移设置中构建具有PAC保证的预测集。该方法通过估计目标域中各类别的预测概率和混淆矩阵，然后通过高斯消元算法传播这些估计的不确定性，计算重要权重的置信区间。最后，使用这些区间构建预测集。我们在五个数据集上评估了我们的方法：CIFAR-10，ChestX-Ray和Entity-13图像数据集，以及表CDC Heart dat。",
