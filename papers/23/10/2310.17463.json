    "translated_abstract": "在个性化医学中，连续时间的治疗效果估计非常重要。然而，现有的方法只能给出潜在结果的点估计，忽略了不确定性的估计。毫无疑问，不确定性量化对于可靠的决策是至关重要的。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了一种新颖的贝叶斯神经控制微分方程(BNCDE)用于连续时间的治疗效果估计。在我们的BNCDE中，时间维度通过一组耦合的神经控制微分方程和神经随机微分方程建模，其中神经随机微分方程允许可行的变分贝叶斯推断。因此，对于给定的治疗序列，我们的BNCDE提供了有意义的潜在结果的后验预测分布。据我们所知，我们的方法是第一个专门提供治疗效果不确定性估计的神经方法。",
