We collect data for the 200 most popular hotels in London (UK) and document that prices vary widely across booking sites while making reservations for a hotel room.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了即使消费者可以轻松从比较网站获取价格信息，但同质化产品在不同在线平台上的普遍价格分散现象。我们收集了伦敦市最受欢迎的200家酒店的数据，并发现在预订酒店房间时，价格在不同预订网站之间存在较大差异。此外，我们发现在预订日期靠近入住日期时，不同平台上的价格趋于一致。然而，价格分散仍然存在直到入住日期，意味着“一价法则”不成立。我们提出了一个简单的理论模型来解释这一现象，并表明在存在总需求不确定性和容量限制的情况下，即使产品是同质化的，消费者是同质化的，所有参与者都对市场结构拥有完美信息，消费者获得产品信息无需付出成本，价格分散仍可能存在。",

Despite easy access to price information, prices for hotel rooms in London vary widely across booking sites. The study shows that price dispersion persists even as the booking date gets closer to the date of stay, and provides a theoretical model explaining the role of demand uncertainty and capacity constraints in maintaining price dispersion."
