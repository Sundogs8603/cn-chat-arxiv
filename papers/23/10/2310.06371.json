The state-of-the-art methods adopt a select-measure-generate paradigm, but measuring large domain marginals still results in much error and allocating privacy budget iteratively is still difficult. To address these issues, our method employs a partition-based approach that effectively reduces errors and improves the quality of synthetic data, even with a limited privacy budget. Results from our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches. The synthetic data produced using our approach exhibits improved quality and utility, making it a preferable choice for private synthetic data sharing.",
