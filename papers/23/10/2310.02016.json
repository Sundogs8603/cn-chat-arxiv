    "abstract": "We focus on the problem of ranking $N$ objects starting from a set of noisy pairwise comparisons provided by a crowd of unequal workers, each worker being characterized by a specific degree of reliability, which reflects her ability to rank pairs of objects. More specifically, we assume that objects are endowed with intrinsic qualities and that the probability with which an object is preferred to another depends both on the difference between the qualities of the two competitors and on the reliability of the worker. We propose QUITE, a non-adaptive ranking algorithm that jointly estimates workers' reliabilities and qualities of objects. Performance of QUITE is compared in different scenarios against previously proposed algorithms. Finally, we show how QUITE can be naturally made adaptive.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们关注的是从一组不平等工人提供的噪声成对比较开始，对$N$个对象进行排序的问题，每个工人都具有特定的可靠性程度，这反映了她对对象对进行排序的能力。具体来说，我们假设对象具有内在质量，一个对象被优选另一个的概率取决于两个竞争者的质量差异和工人的可靠性。我们提出了QUITE，一个非自适应的排序算法，它同时估计工人的可靠性和对象的质量。我们将QUITE在不同场景下与之前提出的算法进行性能比较。最后，我们展示了QUITE如何自然地变得自适应。",
