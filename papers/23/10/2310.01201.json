    "abstract": "Tensor decomposition has recently been gaining attention in the machine learning community for the analysis of individual traces, such as Electronic Health Records (EHR). However, this task becomes significantly more difficult when the data follows complex temporal patterns. This paper introduces the notion of a temporal phenotype as an arrangement of features over time and it proposes SWoTTeD (Sliding Window for Temporal Tensor Decomposition), a novel method to discover hidden temporal patterns. SWoTTeD integrates several constraints and regularizations to enhance the interpretability of the extracted phenotypes. We validate our proposal using both synthetic and real-world datasets, and we present an original usecase using data from the Greater Paris University Hospital. The results show that SWoTTeD achieves at least as accurate reconstruction as recent state-of-the-art tensor decomposition models, and extracts temporal phenotypes that are meaningful for clinicians.",

    "translated_abstract": "张量分解最近在机器学习领域对于个体追踪数据的分析，如电子健康记录(EHR)，引起了人们的关注。然而，当数据遵循复杂的时间模式时，这个任务变得更加困难。本文引入了时间表征的概念，即一组随时间变化的特征，并提出了SWoTTeD (Sliding Window for Temporal Tensor Decomposition)方法，一种发现隐藏时间模式的新方法。SWoTTeD集成了多种约束和正则化方法，以增强提取到的表征的可解释性。我们使用合成数据集和真实世界数据集进行验证，并提供了使用巴黎大学医院的数据的原始用例。结果表明，SWoTTeD能够至少与最新的基于张量分解的模型一样准确地重建数据，并提取到对临床医生有意义的时间表征。",
