    "abstract": "This literature review elucidates the implications of behavioral biases, particularly those stemming from overconfidence and framing, on the intertemporal choices made by students on their underline demand preferences for student loans. A secondary objective is to understand the potential utility of social media to assist students and young borrowers with the debt repayment process and management of their loan tenures. A close examination of the literature reveals a substantial influence of these behavioral and cognitive principles on the intertemporal choices made by students towards debt repayments. This affects not only the magnitude of loans they acquire but also the anchoring of the terms of loan conditions associated with repayment. Furthermore, I establish that harnessing social media as the potential to cultivate financial literacy and enhanced understanding of loan terms to expedite the process of debt redemption. This review could serve as a valuable repository for students, ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文综述了行为偏差对学生在借贷需求偏好方面做出的跨期选择所产生的影响，特别是那些源自于过度自信和框架的偏差。次要目标是了解社交媒体在帮助学生和年轻借款人进行债务偿还和贷款期限管理方面的潜在作用。对文献的仔细研究揭示了这些行为和认知原则对学生在债务偿还方面的跨期选择产生了重要影响。这不仅影响了他们获取的贷款规模，还影响了与偿还相关的贷款条件的锚定。此外，我证明利用社交媒体有潜力培养金融素养，增强对贷款条件的理解，加速债务清偿过程。此综述可作为学生和年轻借款人的有价值的知识库。",
