This paper presents Spatial HuBERT, a self-supervised speech representation model that learns both acoustic and spatial information pertaining to a single speaker in a potentially noisy environment by using multi-channel audio inputs. Spatial HuBERT learns representations that outperform state-of-the-art single-channel speech representations on a variety of spatial downstream tasks, particularly in reverberant and noisy environments.

    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习被用来利用无标注数据，通过训练表示模型改善语音系统的准确性和泛化能力。近期的研究致力于在各种声学领域、语言、模态甚至同时说话者中生成有效的表示，但这些研究都限制在单声道音频记录中。本文提出了Spatial HuBERT，它是一种自监督语音表示模型，通过使用多通道音频输入学习单个说话者在潜在嘈杂环境中的声学和空间信息。Spatial HuBERT学习的表示在各种空间下游任务中表现优于最先进的单声道语音表示，特别是在混响和嘈杂环境中。我们还展示了Spatial HuBERT学习的表示在语音定位任务中的实用性。",
