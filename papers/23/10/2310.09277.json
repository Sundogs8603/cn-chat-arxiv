    "abstract": "Regarding the rising number of people suffering from mental health illnesses in today's society, the importance of mental health cannot be overstated. Wearable sensors, which are increasingly widely available, provide a potential way to track and comprehend mental health issues. These gadgets not only monitor everyday activities but also continuously record vital signs like heart rate, perhaps providing information on a person's mental state. Recent research has used these sensors in conjunction with machine learning methods to identify patterns relating to different mental health conditions, highlighting the immense potential of this data beyond simple activity monitoring. In this research, we present a novel algorithm called the Hybrid Random forest - Neural network that has been tailored to evaluate sensor data from depressed patients. Our method has a noteworthy accuracy of 80\\% when evaluated on a special dataset that included both unipolar and bipolar depressive patients as well ",

    "translated_abstract": "鉴于当今社会患有心理健康疾病的人数不断增加，心理健康的重要性不言而喻。可穿戴传感器，这些传感器越来越普遍，提供了一种追踪和理解心理健康问题的潜在途径。这些设备不仅监测日常活动，还持续记录诸如心率等生命体征，可能提供有关一个人心理状态的信息。最近的研究使用这些传感器与机器学习方法结合，识别与不同心理健康状况相关的模式，突显了这些数据在简单活动监测以外的巨大潜力。在该研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的算法，称为混合随机森林 - 神经网络，该算法针对抑郁患者的传感器数据进行评估。我们的方法在一个特殊数据集上进行评估时，在包括单相和双相抑郁患者的情况下达到了80%的显著准确率。",
