    "abstract": "General-purpose text decoding approaches are usually adopted for dialogue response generation. Although the quality of the generated responses can be improved with dialogue-specific encoding methods, conversational decoding methods are still under-explored. Inspired by \\citet{wu2023learning} that a good dialogue feature space should follow the rules of locality and isotropy, we present a fine-grained conversational decoding method, termed \\textit{isotropic and proximal search (IPS)}. Our method is designed to generate the semantic-concentrated response, while still maintaining informativeness and discrimination against the context. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing decoding strategies in the dialogue field across both automatic and human evaluation metrics. More in-depth analyses further confirm the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "通常采用通用的文本解码方法来进行对话回应生成。虽然采用了对话特定的编码方法可以提高生成的回应质量，但对话解码方法仍然未被充分探索。受到wu2023learning的启发，认为好的对话特征空间应遵循局部性和各向同性规则，我们提出了一种细粒度的对话解码方法，称为各向同性和近端搜索（IPS）。我们的方法旨在生成信息集中的语义回应，同时保持对上下文的信息量和区分度。实验证明，我们的方法在对话领域中的自动评估和人工评估指标上优于现有的解码策略。更深入的分析进一步证实了我们方法的有效性。",
