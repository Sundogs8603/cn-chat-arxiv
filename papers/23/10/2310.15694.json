    "abstract": "The technique of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a commonly employed method to improve pre-trained Language Models (LM), enhancing their ability to conform to human preferences. Nevertheless, the current RLHF-based LMs necessitate full retraining each time novel queries or feedback are introduced, which becomes a challenging task because human preferences can vary between different domains or tasks. Retraining LMs poses practical difficulties in many real-world situations due to the significant time and computational resources required, along with concerns related to data privacy. To address this limitation, we propose a new method called Continual Optimal Policy Fitting (COPF), in which we estimate a series of optimal policies using the Monte Carlo method, and then continually fit the policy sequence with the function regularization. COPF involves a single learning phase and doesn't necessitate complex reinforcement learning. Importantly, it shares the capability ",

    "translated_abstract": "强化学习通过人类反馈（RLHF）的技术是改善预训练语言模型（LM）以符合人类偏好的常用方法。然而，当前基于RLHF的LM在引入新的查询或反馈时需要完全重新训练，这是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为人类偏好在不同领域或任务之间可能会有所变化。由于所需的时间和计算资源以及与数据隐私相关的问题，重新训练LM在许多现实世界的情况下存在实际困难。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一种新的方法，称为持续最优策略拟合（COPF），其中我们使用蒙特卡罗法估计一系列最优策略，然后通过函数正则化不断拟合策略序列。COPF包含一个单一的学习阶段，不需要复杂的强化学习。",
