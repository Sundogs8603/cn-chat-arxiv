    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了VBPI-Mixtures算法，旨在提高系统发育后验分布的准确性，特别是在树形拓扑和分支长度近似方面。尽管变分贝叶斯系统发育推断（VBPI）作为一个领先的黑盒变分推理（BBVI）框架，在这些分布的近似中取得了显著的成果，但树形拓扑后验的多模性对于样本采用学习技术（如BBVI）来说是一个严峻的挑战。先进的深度学习方法，如标准流和图神经网络，已经被应用于改善分支长度后验的近似，但在改进树形拓扑后验的方面的努力还不足。我们的新颖算法VBPI-Mixtures填补了这一空白，将BBVI域内混合学习的最新突破应用其中。因此，VBPI-Mixtures能够捕捉VBPI未能建模的树形拓扑分布。",
