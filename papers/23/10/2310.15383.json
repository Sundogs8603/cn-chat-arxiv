    "abstract": "With the increasing integration of AI into everyday life, it's becoming crucial to design AI systems that serve users from diverse backgrounds by making them culturally aware. In this paper, we present GD-COMET, a geo-diverse version of the COMET commonsense inference model. GD-COMET goes beyond Western commonsense knowledge and is capable of generating inferences pertaining to a broad range of cultures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GD-COMET through a comprehensive human evaluation across 5 diverse cultures, as well as extrinsic evaluation on a geo-diverse task. The evaluation shows that GD-COMET captures and generates culturally nuanced commonsense knowledge, demonstrating its potential to benefit NLP applications across the board and contribute to making NLP more inclusive.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能越来越多地融入日常生活，设计能够满足不同背景用户需求、具有文化意识的人工智能系统变得至关重要。在本文中，我们提出了GD-COMET，这是COMET常识推理模型的地理多样性版本。GD-COMET超越西方常识知识，能够生成涉及广泛文化背景的推理。我们通过对5种不同文化背景进行全面的人工评估以及地理多样性任务的外在评估，证明了GD-COMET的有效性。评估结果表明，GD-COMET能够捕捉和生成具有文化细微差异的常识知识，展示了其在各种自然语言处理应用中发挥作用、促进NLP更加包容的潜力。",
