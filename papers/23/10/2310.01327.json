    "abstract": "We introduce a new model for multivariate probabilistic time series prediction, designed to flexibly address a range of tasks including forecasting, interpolation, and their combinations. Building on copula theory, we propose a simplified objective for the recently-introduced transformer-based attentional copulas (TACTiS), wherein the number of distributional parameters now scales linearly with the number of variables instead of factorially. The new objective requires the introduction of a training curriculum, which goes hand-in-hand with necessary changes to the original architecture. We show that the resulting model has significantly better training dynamics and achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse real-world forecasting tasks, while maintaining the flexibility of prior work, such as seamless handling of unaligned and unevenly-sampled time series.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种新的模型用于多变量概率时间序列预测，旨在灵活地处理包括预测、插值和它们的组合等一系列任务。基于联合分布理论，我们提出了一种简化的目标函数，用于最近引入的基于Transformer的关注联合分布模型（TACTiS）。新的目标函数的分布参数数量与变量数量呈线性而非阶乘关系。新的目标函数需要引入一种训练课程，并且需要对原始架构进行必要的改动。我们展示了得到的模型具有显著改善的训练动态，并在多样的真实世界预测任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了先前工作的灵活性，如无缝处理不对齐和采样不均匀的时间序列。",
