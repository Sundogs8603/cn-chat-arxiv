To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose a novel model named Query-dominant user Interest Network (QIN), including two cascade units to filter the raw user behaviors and reweigh the behavior subsequences.

    "translated_abstract": "历史行为在推荐和信息检索等各种预测任务中展示了巨大的效果和潜力。整体历史行为多样但噪声很大，而搜索行为经常很稀疏。个性化搜索排名中大多数现有方法采用稀疏的搜索行为来学习表示，但不充分利用关键的长期兴趣。事实上，对于即时搜索来说，用户的长期兴趣是多样但噪声很大的，如何充分利用它仍然是一个未解决的问题。为了解决这个问题，我们在这项工作中提出了一个名为查询主导用户兴趣网络（QIN）的新模型，包括两个级联单元来过滤原始用户行为并重新权重行为子序列。具体而言，我们提出了一个相关搜索单元（RSU），其目标是首先搜索与查询相关的子序列，然后搜索与目标项相关的子子序列。",
