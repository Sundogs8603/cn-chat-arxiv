    "translated_abstract": "近年来，跨模态检索的重大进展主要是通过视觉和语言建模的突破推动的。然而，最近的研究表明，多模态数据表示往往在有限的凸锥内聚集（作为表示退化问题），这由于这些表示的不可分离性而阻碍了检索性能。在我们的研究中，我们首先通过多个跨模态基准和方法经验证实了表示退化问题的存在。接下来，为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种新方法，称为InvGC，它是一种受图卷积和平均池化启发的后处理技术。具体而言，InvGC在数据集中定义图拓扑，然后应用图卷积以一种减法的方式。这种方法通过增加数据点之间的距离来有效地分离表示。为了提高InvGC的效率和效果，我们提出了一个高级图拓扑，Lo",
