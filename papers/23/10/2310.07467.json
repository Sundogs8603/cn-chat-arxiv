    "translated_abstract": "企业Wi-Fi网络可以通过人工智能和机器学习（AI/ML）获得巨大的好处，因为它们具有完善的管理和运营能力。同时，基于AI/ML的流量/负载预测是改善Wi-Fi体验最有吸引力的数据驱动解决方案之一，无论是通过实现自主运行还是通过提供预测的网络利用率来提升故障排除能力。在本文中，我们研究了在实际企业Wi-Fi网络中采用基于AI/ML的负载预测的适用性和可行性。虽然利用AI/ML解决方案有可能在能源效率、性能和可靠性方面优化Wi-Fi网络，但其有效采用受到数据可用性和质量、计算能力和能量消耗等因素的限制。我们的结果显示，受硬件限制的AI/ML模型可以在平均误差小于20%和85th百分位误差小于3%的情况下预测网络负载。",
