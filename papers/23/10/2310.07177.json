    "translated_abstract": "推测解码是通过利用较小的草稿模型来预测目标模型的输出，从而加速大型语言模型（LLM）推理的关键技术。然而，在面对多样的文本输入和草稿模型与目标模型之间的显著能力差距时，其有效性可能受到限制。我们引入了在线推测解码（OSD）来解决这一挑战。其主要思想是利用LLM服务集群中丰富的多余计算能力，根据观察到的用户查询数据持续更新（多个）草稿模型。由于LLM推理受内存限制，典型的LLM服务集群中的剩余计算能力可以用于在线重新训练草稿模型，从而使训练成本保持中性。由于LLM服务的查询分布相对简单，根据查询分布进行重新训练可以使草稿模型更准确地预测目标模型的输出。",
