    "translated_abstract": "大型开放知识库（OKB）的构建对移动计算领域中的许多应用至关重要。OKB中的名词短语和关系短语经常存在冗余和歧义，这就需要对OKB进行规范化的研究。然而，为了满足一些隐私保护规定的要求，并确保数据的及时性，规范化后的OKB通常需要删除一些敏感信息或过时数据。OKB规范化中的机器取消学习是解决上述问题的一个很好的方法。目前的解决方案通过设计先进的聚类算法和使用知识图谱嵌入（KGE）进一步促进规范化过程。迫切需要有效的方案充分协同机器取消学习与聚类和KGE学习。为此，我们提出了一个多任务取消学习框架，名为MulCanon，来解决OKB规范化中的机器取消学习问题。",
