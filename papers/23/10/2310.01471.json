    "translated_abstract": "本研究面临着一个具有挑战性的益智游戏——《难以构建的好雪人》。游戏的目标是在离散的格子上移动和堆叠雪球来建造雪人。为了提高玩家的游戏参与度，避免玩家找到比设计者预期的更简单的解决方案是很有趣的。因此，具备能够验证解决方案最优性的工具至关重要。尽管游戏可以作为一个规划问题来描述，并且可以在PDDL中进行自然建模，但我们展示了直接将其转化为SAT的方法明显优于现有的最先进的规划器。正如我们所展示的那样，这主要是因为可达性属性可以很容易地在SAT中建模，从而获得更短的解决方案，而在PDDL中使用公理来表示可达性派生谓词并不会显著减少解决时间。我们处理了一组51个关卡，包括原创和设计的关卡，成功解决了43个。",
