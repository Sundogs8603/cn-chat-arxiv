    "abstract": "Understanding the movement patterns of objects (e.g., humans and vehicles) in a city is essential for many applications, including city planning and management. This paper proposes a method for predicting future city-wide crowd flows by modeling the spatio-temporal patterns of historical crowd flows in fine-grained city-wide maps. We introduce a novel neural network named PArallel Spatio-Temporal Attention with spatial auto-correlation gating (PASTA) that effectively captures the irregular spatio-temporal patterns of fine-grained maps. The novel components in our approach include spatial auto-correlation gating, multi-scale residual block, and temporal attention gating module. The spatial auto-correlation gating employs the concept of spatial statistics to identify irregular spatial regions. The multi-scale residual block is responsible for handling multiple range spatial dependencies in the fine-grained map, and the temporal attention gating filters out irrelevant temporal information",

    "translated_abstract": "理解城市中物体（如人类和车辆）的运动模式对于许多应用非常重要，包括城市规划和管理。本文提出了一种通过建模细粒度城市地图中历史人流的时空模式来预测未来全市范围内人群流的方法。我们引入了一种名为PASTA的新型神经网络，它有效地捕捉了细粒度地图中的不规则时空模式。我们方法中的新颖组件包括空间自相关门控、多尺度残差块和时序注意力门控模块。空间自相关门控采用空间统计的概念来识别不规则的空间区域。多尺度残差块负责处理细粒度地图中的多个范围空间依赖关系，而时序注意力门控则过滤掉不相关的时间信息。",
