    "translated_abstract": "在线市场每天在平台上执行大量的价格更新，这些更新由个体市场卖家发起。这种价格民主化随着数据质量的挑战而增加。相对于传统的在线零售商，缺乏集中的防护措施会导致更高的错误价格在网站上发布，从而给顾客体验带来差评和潜在的收入损失。我们提出了MoatPlus（使用树、基于邻近度的标签以及无监督统计特征的蒙面最优锚点），这是一个用于不断增长的市场平台的可扩展价格异常检测框架。目标是利用邻近度和历史价格趋势的无监督统计特征来生成上限价格边界。我们构建了一个模型集合来检测基于价格的特征中的异常情况，排除异常特征，并使用优化的加权方案来构建实时定价管道中可靠的价格边界。",
