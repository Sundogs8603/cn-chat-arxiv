    "abstract": "Covariate shift in the test data can significantly downgrade both the accuracy and the fairness performance of the model. Ensuring fairness across different sensitive groups in such settings is of paramount importance due to societal implications like criminal justice. We operate under the unsupervised regime where only a small set of unlabeled test samples along with a labeled training set is available. Towards this problem, we make three contributions. First is a novel composite weighted entropy based objective for prediction accuracy which is optimized along with a representation matching loss for fairness. We experimentally verify that optimizing with our loss formulation outperforms a number of state-of-the-art baselines in the pareto sense with respect to the fairness-accuracy tradeoff on several standard datasets. Our second contribution is a new setting we term Asymmetric Covariate Shift that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied before. Asymmetric covariate shift",

    "translated_abstract": "测试数据中的协变量转移会显著降低模型的准确性和公平性表现。在这种情况下，确保不同敏感群体之间的公平性非常重要，因为这涉及到诸如刑事司法等社会影响。我们在无监督的情况下进行操作，只有一小组无标签的测试样本和一个带标签的训练集可用。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了三个贡献。第一个贡献是基于新型复合加权熵的目标函数，用于预测准确性，并通过表示匹配损失来优化公平性。我们通过实验证明，使用我们的损失函数进行优化，在几个标准数据集上在公平性-准确性权衡方面优于许多最先进的基线算法。我们的第二个贡献是一个新的设置，我们称之为非对称协变量转移，在我们所知的范围内尚未研究过非对称协变量转移。",
