    "translated_abstract": "在传统的3D建模工具中，探索3D形状的变化是一个耗时的过程。3D形状的深度生成模型通常具有连续的潜在空间，可以用来从一组输入形状开始探索潜在的变化。然而，在实践中，这样做可能存在问题：潜在空间是高维的，很难可视化，包含与输入形状无关的形状，并且通过线性路径进行探索往往会导致次优的形状过渡。此外，理想情况下，我们希望能够在用于训练生成模型的原始高质量网格中探索变化，而不是其较低质量的输出几何形状。在本文中，我们提出了一种方法，通过构建从易于导航的2D探索空间到预训练生成模型的子空间的映射，来探索给定一组标志性形状的变化。我们首先描述如何找到覆盖输入标志性形状并呈现平滑变化的映射。",
