    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）被广泛应用于完成不同任务，如个人助理或事件规划。虽然大多数工作都集中在智能体之间的合作与协作，但很少有研究探索另一个重要机制——竞争，它是社会和经济发展的推动力之一。本文旨在研究LLM智能体之间的竞争行为。我们首先提出一个通用框架来研究智能体之间的竞争。然后，我们使用GPT-4实现了一个实际的竞争环境，模拟了一个由餐馆智能体和顾客智能体组成的虚拟城镇。具体而言，餐馆智能体相互竞争以吸引更多顾客，这种竞争促使它们进行转变，比如培养新的运营策略。我们实验的结果揭示了从社会学习到马太效应等多个有趣发现，与现有的社会学和经济学理论相一致。",
