    "abstract": "We study how humans learn from AI, exploiting an introduction of an AI-powered Go program (APG) that unexpectedly outperformed the best professional player. We compare the move quality of professional players to that of APG's superior solutions around its public release. Our analysis of 749,190 moves demonstrates significant improvements in players' move quality, accompanied by decreased number and magnitude of errors. The effect is pronounced in the early stages of the game where uncertainty is highest. In addition, younger players and those in AI-exposed countries experience greater improvement, suggesting potential inequality in learning from AI. Further, while players of all levels learn, less skilled players derive higher marginal benefits. These findings have implications for managers seeking to adopt and utilize AI effectively within their organizations.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了人类如何从人工智能中学习，利用了一个突然击败最好的职业选手的AI-Powered围棋程序（APG）的引入。我们比较了职业选手的着法质量和APG在其公开发布前后的卓越解决方案的着法质量。我们分析了749,190个着法，发现了玩家着法质量的显著提升，同时错误数量和大小的减少。这种效果在比赛的初期阶段尤为显著，因为此时不确定性最大。此外，年轻选手和那些处于接触过人工智能的国家的选手获得了更大的改进，这表明了从人工智能中学习可能存在的不平等问题。此外，虽然各个水平的选手都能学习，但技术较差的选手获得了更高的边际效益。这些发现对于寻求在组织中有效采用和利用人工智能的管理者具有重要影响。",
