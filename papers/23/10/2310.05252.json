For a one-to-one matching market, we show an equivalence between individual and group strategy-proofness under stability. We obtain this equivalence assuming the domain satisfies a richness condition. However, the result cannot be extended to the many-to-one matching markets. We further consider a setting with single-peaked preferences and characterize all domains compatible for stability and (group) strategy-proofness.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了稳定性下双边匹配市场中（群体）策略无虞的方面。对于一对一匹配市场，我们在稳定性下证明了个体和群体策略无虞之间的等价性。我们在满足一定丰富性条件的情况下得出了这个等价性。然而，这个结论不能推广到多对一匹配市场。我们进一步考虑了具有单峰偏好的情景，并刻画了所有满足稳定性和（群体）策略无虞的域。",
