    "abstract": "In this work, we explore how a real time reading tracker can be built efficiently for children's voices. While previously proposed reading trackers focused on ASR-based cascaded approaches, we propose a fully end-to-end model making it less prone to lags in voice tracking. We employ a pointer network that directly learns to predict positions in the ground truth text conditioned on the streaming speech. To train this pointer network, we generate ground truth training signals by using forced alignment between the read speech and the text being read on the training set. Exploring different forced alignment models, we find a neural attention based model is at least as close in alignment accuracy to the Montreal Forced Aligner, but surprisingly is a better training signal for the pointer network. Our results are reported on one adult speech data (TIMIT) and two children's speech datasets (CMU Kids and Reading Races). Our best model can accurately track adult speech with 87.8% accuracy and t",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了如何高效地构建一个用于儿童语音的实时阅读跟踪器。之前提出的阅读跟踪器主要基于ASR的级联方法，我们提出了一个完全端到端的模型，使其对语音跟踪的延迟更少。我们采用指针网络，直接学习在流式语音中预测与真实文本位置对应的能力。为了训练这个指针网络，我们使用强制对齐在训练集上生成真实的训练信号，从而对读出的语音和被读文本进行对齐。在探索不同的强制对齐模型时，我们发现基于神经注意力的模型在对齐准确性上至少与蒙特利尔强制对齐器相当，但令人惊讶的是，它更适合用作指针网络的训练信号。我们的结果报告了一个成人语音数据集(TIMIT)和两个儿童语音数据集(CMU Kids和Reading Races)。我们的最佳模型能够以87.8%的准确率跟踪成人语音。",

By using a pointer network and forced alignment to generate training signals, our model accurately tracks adult speech and performs well on children's speech datasets."
