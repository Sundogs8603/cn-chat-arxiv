    "translated_abstract": "可扩展和有效的校准是低成本空气质量监测系统的基本要求，将使得在城市中能够进行准确和普遍的监测。受环境干扰和制造差异的影响，这些设备需要包括传感器特定的和复杂的校准流程，以达到足够的准确性，以便作为指示性测量设备部署在空气质量（AQ）监测网络中。概念和传感器漂移经常强制进行频繁的校准过程。这些问题导致无法承受的校准成本，从而阻止了它们在关注准确性时的大规模部署。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于低成本颗粒物（PM）传感器的零传输样本的全局校准方法，作为物联网AQ多感知设备的技术实现。这种方法基于从有限数量的物联网AQ多传感器单元中记录的现场响应和机器学习概念。",
