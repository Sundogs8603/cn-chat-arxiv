    "translated_abstract": "神经网络在语言建模和各种下游任务中取得了革命性的进展。然而，这些模型在组合泛化方面能否达到与人类认知能力相媲美的程度仍然存在争议。虽然该领域现有的方法主要关注于新颖的架构和替代的学习范式，但我们引入了一种开创性的方法，利用数据集制图的力量（Swayamdipta等，2020）。通过使用这种方法策略性地识别一部分组合泛化数据子集，我们在模型准确性方面取得了显著的改进，CFQ和COGS数据集的性能提升高达10%。值得注意的是，我们的技术将数据集制图作为课程学习准则，消除了超参数调整的需要，同时始终实现了卓越的性能。我们的研究结果凸显了数据集制图在发挥组合泛化的全部潜力方面的未开发潜力。",
