    "translated_abstract": "最近大型语言模型的进展已经在许多行业中引起了革命，包括数据库行业。在处理大量的表格数据时，一个常见的挑战是普遍使用缩写的列名称，这可能会对各种数据搜索、访问和理解任务产生负面影响。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新的任务，名为NameGuess，将扩展列名称（用于数据库模式）视为自然语言生成问题。我们使用一种新的数据制作方法创建了一个包含384K个缩写-扩展列对的训练数据集，并使用人工标注的评估基准进行评估，其中包括来自真实世界表格的9.2K个例子。为了应对NameGuess中的多义和歧义带来的复杂性，我们通过对表格内容和列头名称进行调整来增强自回归语言模型，得到了一个经过微调的模型（具有2.7B个参数），其性能与人类相匹配。此外，我们进行了全面的分析（o",
