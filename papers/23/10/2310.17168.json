    "translated_abstract": "本文在面对一般到货动态的情况下解决了学习和回测库存控制策略的问题，我们将其称为数量随时间到货模型（QOT）。在实际供应链中，我们还允许修改订购数量以满足供应商的限制，例如订购最低数量和批次大小约束。据我们所知，这是第一篇处理任意到货动态或任意后续处理的订购数量的研究。在最近的工作（Madeka等，2022）的基础上，我们同样将周期性审核库存控制问题定义为外部决策过程，其中大部分状态不受代理的控制。Madeka等人（2022）展示了如何构建一个模拟器来回放历史数据以解决这类问题。在我们的例子中，我们将一个深度生成模型纳入到货过程的历史回放中。",
