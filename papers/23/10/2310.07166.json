    "translated_abstract": "多视图聚类因其能够从多个信息源中聚合信息的能力以及在公共事务中有前景的潜力而引起越来越多的关注。迄今为止，在近期文献中提出了许多先进的方法。然而，仍然存在一些难题需要解决。在试图对不同视图的特征进行对齐时，出现了一个常见的困境。我们通过分层特征下降挖掘和部署视图之间的依赖关系，从而导致一个共同的潜在空间（第一阶段）。这个潜在空间首次被视为“相似空间”，因为它揭示了不同视图之间的某些相关性和依赖关系。更准确地说，类别的独热编码也可以被称为终止阶段的相似空间。此外，由于大多数现有的多视图聚类算法起源于k-means聚类和谱聚类，这导致了立方时间复杂度。",
