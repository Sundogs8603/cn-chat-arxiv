    "abstract": "In light of the widespread success of generative models, a significant amount of research has gone into speeding up their sampling time. However, generative models are often sampled multiple times to obtain a diverse set incurring a cost that is orthogonal to sampling time. We tackle the question of how to improve diversity and sample efficiency by moving beyond the common assumption of independent samples. We propose particle guidance, an extension of diffusion-based generative sampling where a joint-particle time-evolving potential enforces diversity. We analyze theoretically the joint distribution that particle guidance generates, its implications on the choice of potential, and the connections with methods in other disciplines. Empirically, we test the framework both in the setting of conditional image generation, where we are able to increase diversity without affecting quality, and molecular conformer generation, where we reduce the state-of-the-art median error by 13% on average",

    "translated_abstract": "鉴于生成模型的广泛成功，已经有大量的研究致力于加快其采样时间。然而，为了获取多样性样本，生成模型通常需要进行多次采样，这会造成与采样时间无关的成本。本文处理了如何通过超越独立样本的常见假设来提高多样性和采样效率的问题。我们提出了粒子引导，一种基于扩散的生成采样的扩展，其中的联合粒子时变位势强制实现多样性。我们从理论上分析了粒子引导产生的联合分布，以及它对位势选择的影响和与其他学科方法的联系。在实证方面，我们在条件图像生成的设置中进行了测试，我们能够增加多样性而不影响质量，并在分子构象生成中降低了平均13%的先进技术中值误差。",
