    "abstract": "Consider learning a decision support assistant to serve as an intermediary between (oracle) expert behavior and (imperfect) human behavior: At each time, the algorithm observes an action chosen by a fallible agent, and decides whether to *accept* that agent's decision, *intervene* with an alternative, or *request* the expert's opinion. For instance, in clinical diagnosis, fully-autonomous machine behavior is often beyond ethical affordances, thus real-world decision support is often limited to monitoring and forecasting. Instead, such an intermediary would strike a prudent balance between the former (purely prescriptive) and latter (purely descriptive) approaches, while providing an efficient interface between human mistakes and expert feedback. In this work, we first formalize the sequential problem of *online decision mediation* -- that is, of simultaneously learning and evaluating mediator policies from scratch with *abstentive feedback*: In each round, deferring to the oracle obvia",

    "translated_abstract": "考虑学习一个决策支持助手，作为(oracle)专家行为和(不完美)人类行为之间的中介：每次算法观察到一个由易出错的代理选择的动作，并决定是否接受代理的决策，干预替代，或要求专家的意见。在临床诊断中，完全自主的机器行为往往超出了伦理上的承受范围，因此现实世界中的决策支持往往只限于监测和预测。相反，这样的中介能够在纯指导性方法和纯描述性方法之间取得谨慎的平衡，同时提供人类错误和专家反馈之间的高效接口。在这项工作中，我们首先形式化了“在线决策调解”的顺序问题 - 即从头开始同时学习和评估中介策略，使用“缺失反馈”：在每一轮中，遵循oracle的建议",
