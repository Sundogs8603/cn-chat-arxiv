    "translated_abstract": "神经辐射场（NeRF）已经显示出在新视角合成方面的令人印象深刻的结果。然而，它们依赖于单输入单输出多层感知机（SISO MLP）的重复使用，将3D坐标和视角映射到颜色和体积密度，这会导致渲染速度变慢。我们提出了一种多输入多输出神经辐射场（MIMO-NeRF），通过将SISO MLP替换为MIMO MLP并进行分组映射来减少运行的MLP数量。其中一个显著的挑战是，每个点的颜色和体积密度可以根据组内输入坐标的选择有所不同，这可能会导致一些明显的模糊性。我们还提出了一种自监督学习方法，通过多个快速重构的MLP对MIMO MLP进行正则化，以减轻此模糊性而无需使用预训练模型。我们呈现了包括比较和消融研究在内的全面的实验评估结果。",
