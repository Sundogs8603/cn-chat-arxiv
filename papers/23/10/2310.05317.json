    "abstract": "We propose task-adaptive tokenization as a way to adapt the generation pipeline to the specifics of a downstream task and enhance long-form generation in mental health. Inspired by insights from cognitive science, our task-adaptive tokenizer samples variable segmentations from multiple outcomes, with sampling probabilities optimized based on task-specific data. We introduce a strategy for building a specialized vocabulary and introduce a vocabulary merging protocol that allows for the integration of task-specific tokens into the pre-trained model's tokenization step. Through extensive experiments on psychological question-answering tasks in both Chinese and English, we find that our task-adaptive tokenization approach brings a significant improvement in generation performance while using up to 60% fewer tokens. Preliminary experiments point to promising results when using our tokenization approach with very large language models.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了任务自适应分词作为一种方式，将生成流水线适应于下游任务的特定要求，并增强在心理健康领域的长文本生成。受认知科学的启发，我们的任务自适应分词器从多个结果中采样可变的分段，采样概率基于任务特定的数据进行优化。我们引入了一种构建专用词汇的策略，并介绍了一种词汇合并协议，可以将任务特定的标记整合到预训练模型的分词步骤中。通过对中英文心理问答任务进行广泛实验，我们发现我们的任务自适应分词方法在使用更少的标记的情况下带来了显著的生成性能提升，最高可达60%。初步实验表明，使用我们的分词方法与非常大的语言模型结合能够得到有希望的结果。",
