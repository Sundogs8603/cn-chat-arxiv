    "translated_abstract": "解剖结构的确定通常是许多医学图像分析工作流的第一步。虽然卷积神经网络可以实现高性能，但这些网络没有结合解剖形状信息。我们介绍了一种新的分割算法，使用深层条件形状模型（DCSMs）作为核心组件。通过使用深层隐式形状表示，该算法学习到了一个与模态无关的形状模型，可以为任何感兴趣的解剖特征生成有符号距离函数。为了使生成的形状拟合图像，形状模型是根据可以自动检测到或由用户提供的解剖标记条件化的。最后，我们添加了一个模态相关的、轻量级的细化网络，用于捕捉隐式函数未表示的任何细节。所提出的DCSM框架在多个3D模态（增强CT，非增强CT，3D超声心动图）的心脏左心室（LV）分割问题上进行了评估。",
