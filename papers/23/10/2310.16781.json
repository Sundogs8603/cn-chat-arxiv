    "abstract": "Although the mapping between sound and meaning in human language is assumed to be largely arbitrary, research in cognitive science has shown that there are non-trivial correlations between particular sounds and meanings across languages and demographic groups, a phenomenon known as sound symbolism. Among the many dimensions of meaning, sound symbolism is particularly salient and well-demonstrated with regards to cross-modal associations between language and the visual domain. In this work, we address the question of whether sound symbolism is reflected in vision-and-language models such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion. Using zero-shot knowledge probing to investigate the inherent knowledge of these models, we find strong evidence that they do show this pattern, paralleling the well-known kiki-bouba effect in psycholinguistics. Our work provides a novel method for demonstrating sound symbolism and understanding its nature using computational tools. Our code will be made publicly available.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管人类语言中的声音和意义之间的映射被认为在很大程度上是随机的，但认知科学的研究表明，在语言和人口群体之间的特定声音和意义之间存在非平凡的相关性，这种现象被称为声音象征性。在许多意义维度中，声音象征性在语言和视觉领域之间的跨模态关联方面尤为显著和充分证明。在这项工作中，我们探讨了声音象征性是否在CLIP和Stable Diffusion等视觉与语言模型中得到体现。通过使用零样本知识探测来调查这些模型的内在知识，我们发现强有力的证据表明它们确实显示了这种模式，与心理语言学中众所周知的kiki-bouba效应相一致。我们的工作提供了一种使用计算工具来展示声音象征性并理解其本质的新方法。我们的代码将公开提供。",
