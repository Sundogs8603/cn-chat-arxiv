    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）被观察到在训练数据中编码和传播有害的关联。我们提出了一个理论基础的框架，称为StereoMap，以了解它们对社会各群体的看法。该框架基于心理学中的刻板印象内容模型（SCM），该理论认为刻板印象并不相同，而是温暖和能力这两个维度的因素划分了刻板印象的性质。基于SCM理论，StereoMap使用温暖和能力这两个维度来描绘LLMs对社会群体（通过社会人口特征定义）的感知。此外，该框架还可以调查LLMs判断的关键词和推理的言语化，以揭示影响它们感知的潜在因素。我们的结果显示，LLMs对这些群体表现出多样化的感知，具有混合的特征。",
