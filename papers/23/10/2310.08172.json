    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have not only exhibited exceptional performance across various tasks, but also demonstrated sparks of intelligence. Recent studies have focused on assessing their capabilities on human exams and revealed their impressive competence in different domains. However, cognitive research on the overall knowledge structure of LLMs is still lacking. In this paper, based on educational diagnostic assessment method, we conduct an evaluation using MoocRadar, a meticulously annotated human test dataset based on Bloom Taxonomy. We aim to reveal the knowledge structures of LLMs and gain insights of their cognitive capabilities. This research emphasizes the significance of investigating LLMs' knowledge and understanding the disparate cognitive patterns of LLMs. By shedding light on models' knowledge, researchers can advance development and utilization of LLMs in a more informed and effective manner.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）不仅在各种任务中表现出了卓越的性能，还展示了智能的火花。最近的研究集中在评估它们在人类考试中的能力，并揭示了它们在不同领域的出色能力。然而，关于LLMs整体知识结构的认知研究仍然缺乏。本文基于教育诊断评估方法，在MoocRadar上进行评估，这是一个根据布鲁姆分类法进行细致注释的人类测试数据集。我们的目标是揭示LLMs的知识结构，并对它们的认知能力进行深入理解。本研究强调了调查LLMs的知识和理解其认知模式的重要性。通过照亮模型的知识，研究人员可以更加明确和有效地促进LLMs的开发和利用。",
