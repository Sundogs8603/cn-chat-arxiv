    "abstract": "Abstracts derived from biomedical literature possess distinct domain-specific characteristics, including specialised writing styles and biomedical terminologies, which necessitate a deep understanding of the related literature. As a result, existing language models struggle to generate technical summaries that are on par with those produced by biomedical experts, given the absence of domain-specific background knowledge. This paper aims to enhance the performance of language models in biomedical abstractive summarisation by aggregating knowledge from external papers cited within the source article. We propose a novel attention-based citation aggregation model that integrates domain-specific knowledge from citation papers, allowing neural networks to generate summaries by leveraging both the paper content and relevant knowledge from citation papers. Furthermore, we construct and release a large-scale biomedical summarisation dataset that serves as a foundation for our research. Extensiv",

    "translated_abstract": "生物医学文献中的摘要具有特定的领域特征，包括专门的写作风格和生物医学术语，这要求对相关文献有深入的理解。因此，现有的语言模型在生成与生物医学专家相媲美的技术摘要时存在困难，缺乏领域特定的背景知识。本论文旨在通过聚合源论文中引用的外部论文中的知识，提高生物医学摘要总结的语言模型的性能。我们提出了一种新颖的基于注意力的引文聚合模型，它将引文论文中的领域特定知识与论文内容相结合，使神经网络能够利用论文内容和引文论文中的相关知识生成摘要。此外，我们还构建并发布了一个大规模的生物医学摘要总结数据集作为我们研究的基础。",
