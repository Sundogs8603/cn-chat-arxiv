We present key properties for the language motivated by the design of a descriptive language to encode complex requirements on computer systems, and we explain how these key properties must be addressed to model these requirements with simple definitions. We give an overview of a tool that helps to describe problems in an easy way that we consider more transparent and less error-prone.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了Soda（Symbolic Objective Descriptive Analysis），一种语言，有助于以自然的方式处理质量和数量，并极大地简化了检查它们正确性的任务。我们介绍了语言的关键属性，这些属性是由对计算机系统复杂要求进行描述的设计所激发的，并解释了如何通过简单的定义来建模这些要求时必须解决这些关键属性。我们概述了一个工具，它有助于以更透明和更少出错的方式描述问题。",
