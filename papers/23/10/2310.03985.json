    "abstract": "Dementia diagnosis requires a series of different testing methods, which is complex and time-consuming. Early detection of dementia is crucial as it can prevent further deterioration of the condition. This paper utilizes a speech recognition model to construct a dementia assessment system tailored for Mandarin speakers during the picture description task. By training an attention-based speech recognition model on voice data closely resembling real-world scenarios, we have significantly enhanced the model's recognition capabilities. Subsequently, we extracted the encoder from the speech recognition model and added a linear layer for dementia assessment. We collected Mandarin speech data from 99 subjects and acquired their clinical assessments from a local hospital. We achieved an accuracy of 92.04% in Alzheimer's disease detection and a mean absolute error of 9% in clinical dementia rating score prediction.",

    "translated_abstract": "痴呆诊断需要一系列不同的测试方法，这是复杂且耗时的。痴呆的早期检测非常重要，因为它可以防止病情进一步恶化。本文利用语音识别模型构建了一个针对普通话使用者在图片描述任务中的痴呆评估系统。通过在与真实世界情境非常相似的语音数据上训练基于注意力的语音识别模型，我们显著提高了模型的识别能力。随后，我们从语音识别模型中提取编码器，并添加了一个线性层用于痴呆评估。我们收集了来自99名被试的普通话语音数据，并从当地医院获取了他们的临床评估数据。在阿尔茨海默病检测中，我们实现了92.04%的准确性，并在临床痴呆评分预测中达到了9%的平均绝对误差。",
