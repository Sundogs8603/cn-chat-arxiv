    "translated_abstract": "模拟流体动力学对于设计和开发过程至关重要，涵盖了从简单阀门到复杂涡轮机械的范围。准确求解潜在的物理方程具有计算成本高的特点。因此，基于学习的求解器在网格上建模相互作用并具有显著的加速优势。然而，目前尚不清楚这些模型在多大程度上真正理解潜在的物理原理，并能够实现泛化而非插值。泛化是通用流体模拟器的关键要求，它应该能够适应不同的拓扑结构、分辨率或热力学范围。我们提出了SURF，这是一个旨在测试学习的基于图的流体模拟器的泛化能力的基准测试。SURF包括各个数据集，并提供用于评估和比较不同模型的具体性能和泛化度量指标。我们通过深入研究两种最先进的模型，实证地证明了SURF的适用性。",
