    "translated_abstract": "最近发展的NLP可解释性方法以各种方式打开了黑箱，但是在这一努力中缺少的是提供对话界面的交互工具。这样的对话系统可以帮助用户以情境化的方式通过澄清或后续问题，并通过自然语言接口探索具有解释的数据集和模型。我们将对话式解释框架TalkToModel（Slack等，2022）改编为NLP领域，增加了自由文本解释等新的NLP特定操作，并展示了它在三个NLP任务（对话行为分类，问答，仇恨言论检测）上的泛化能力。为了识别用户的解释查询，我们评估了精调和少样本提示模型，并实施了一种新颖的基于适配器的方法。然后我们进行了两个用户研究：（1）评估对话的正确性和有用性，（2）可模拟性，即如何对象化用户对话。",
