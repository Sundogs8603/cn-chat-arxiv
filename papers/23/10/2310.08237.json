    "translated_abstract": "在实际应用中，协变量漂移是普遍存在的，即源数据和目标数据的输入分布存在显著差异。尽管在各种学习问题中具有实际重要性，但现有的大多数方法只关注于一些特定的学习任务，并没有在理论上和数值上得到很好的验证。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个在协变量漂移下对一般非参数方法进行统一分析的方法。我们的理论结果适用于属于一个丰富的损失函数家族的一般损失，其中包括许多常用的方法，如均值回归、分位数回归、基于似然的分类和基于边缘的分类。本文重点研究了两类协变量漂移问题，并为一般损失函数建立了尖锐的收敛速度以提供一个统一的理论分析，该结果与文献中的最优结果一致。",
