    "translated_abstract": "最近关于SLAM的研究将其姿态图与更高级的语义概念（如Rooms）扩展，利用它们之间的关系，不仅提供了更丰富的情境/环境表示，而且提高了其估计的准确性。具体而言，我们先前的工作Situational Graphs (S-Graphs+)，作为在因子优化过程中共同利用语义关系的先驱，依赖于数学定义的Plane和Room等语义实体的关系。然而，在发现与不同性质的高级概念对应的所有隐藏模式的下级因子图中并没有唯一方法。目前，它通过特定算法来解决，限制了其图表达能力。为了克服这一局限性，在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于图神经网络的算法，用于学习可以从中推断各种高级语义关系概念的内容。",
