    "translated_abstract": "人工智能在科学中的应用，尤其是自动驾驶实验室的形式，有可能排除人类参与并阻碍更广泛社区内的科学发现。虽然以前的研究已经关注确保人工智能应用的负责任部署、增强安全性和确保可解释性，但我们还提出应仔细考虑推动人工智能应用于开放科学领域的发现。在本文中，我们介绍了AI for Open Science (AI4OS)的概念，将其作为AI for Science (AI4Science)的多智能体扩展，其核心原则是通过科学企业中的开放知识转化来最大化开放性。我们使用知识发现与数据挖掘（KDD）的已建立原则来形式化AI4OS的语言。然后，我们讨论了嵌入在AI4Science系统中的三个知识转化阶段，并详细介绍了开放性可以应用于产生AI4OS替代方案的特定点。最后，我们提出了一个数学框架，可以用于量化AI4OS的开放程度。",
