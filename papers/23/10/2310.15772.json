    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体上的仇恨言论威胁到个人的心理和身体健康，并且进一步导致现实中的暴力事件。仇恨言论传播背后的重要驱动因素是转发，但是人们很少了解为什么用户会转发仇恨言论。本文提供了一个全面、因果分析的用户属性框架，研究用户为何分享仇恨言论。然而，在从社交媒体数据中进行因果推断时存在一些挑战，因为这类数据很可能存在选择偏差，并且用户对仇恨言论的脆弱性存在混淆。我们开发了一个新颖的三步因果框架：（1）我们通过逆向倾向评分来消除观察性社交媒体数据的偏差。（2）我们使用消除偏差的倾向评分来模拟用户对仇恨言论的潜在脆弱性作为潜在嵌入。（3）我们建立了用户属性对用户分享仇恨言论概率的因果效应模型。",
