    "translated_abstract": "谱嵌入是一种强大的图嵌入技术，由于其对图转换器的有效性，最近受到了很多关注。然而，从理论角度来看，谱嵌入的普遍表达能力造成了图的两个重要不变性属性（符号和基底不变性）的丧失，这也限制了其在图数据上的有效性。为了解决这个问题，之前的许多方法开发了昂贵的学习新不变性的方法，并且计算复杂度很高。在这项工作中，我们探索了一种最小化的方法，通过直接找到特征向量的规范方向来解决模糊性问题，命名为Laplacian规范化（LC）。作为一种纯预处理方法，LC具有轻量级和可应用于任何现有GNN的特点。我们对这种方法进行了从理论到算法的彻底研究，并发现了一种高效的算法，名为最大轴投影（MAP），适用于符号和基底两种不变性。",
