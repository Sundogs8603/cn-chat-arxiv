    "abstract": "Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement holds promise as a viable method for sustainable energy. However, most fusion devices have been experimental and as we move towards energy reactors, we are entering into a new paradigm of engineering. Curating a design for a fusion reactor is a high-dimensional multi-output optimisation process. Through this work we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of an AI-driven strategy to help explore the design search space and identify optimum parameters. By utilising a Multi-Output Bayesian Optimisation scheme, our strategy is capable of identifying the Pareto front associated with the optimisation of the toroidal field coil shape of a tokamak. The optimisation helps to identify design parameters that would minimise the costs incurred while maximising the plasma stability by way of minimising magnetic ripples.",

    "translated_abstract": "利用磁约束进行核聚变被认为是可持续能源的一种有前途的方法。然而，大多数聚变装置都处于实验阶段，而我们正在向能源反应堆转变，进入了一种新的工程范式。设计聚变反应堆是一个高维多输出的优化过程。本文通过一个AI驱动的策略的概念验证，展示了一种帮助探索设计搜索空间和识别最佳参数的方法。通过利用多输出贝叶斯优化方案，我们的策略能够识别与托卡马克托占除环形磁场线圈的优化相关的帕累托前沿。优化有助于识别设计参数，从而最大限度地减少成本，同时通过减少磁涟波来最大化等离子体稳定性。",
