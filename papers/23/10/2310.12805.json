    "translated_abstract": "因果分析可以帮助我们解析问题的所有可能原因，如不良的商业情况或对个人的意外伤害。这意味着我们可以确定问题的继承方式，对原因进行排序以帮助确定修复优先级，简化复杂问题并进行可视化。在机器学习（ML）的背景下，可以使用因果分析来理解系统偏倚行为的原因。例如，我们可以通过检查每个特征是否对模型中的偏见有潜在影响来检查偏见的根本原因。为了实现这一点，可以对给定的特征或一对特征进行微小修改，并遵循一些准则观察它对模型决策（即模型预测）的影响。因此，即使这些特征最初是未知的，我们也可以使用因果分析来确定潜在的引起偏倚特征。这很重要，因为大多数当前的方法要求事先知道这些特征。",
