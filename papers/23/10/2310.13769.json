    "translated_abstract": "DNA编码库（DEL）已被证明是一种利用组合构建的小分子进行高效筛选的强大工具。这些选择实验涉及多个阶段的洗涤、洗脱，并通过唯一的DNA条形码鉴定出强效结合物质，往往产生复杂的数据。这种复杂性可能掩盖了潜在的信号，因此需要应用机器学习等计算工具来发现有价值的见解。我们引入了一个DEL数据的组合深度概率模型DEL-Compose，它将分子表示分解为它们的单合子、二合子和三合子构建块，并通过模拟嵌入合成物之间的潜在反应来利用这些分子的内在分层结构。此外，我们还研究了改进DEL计数数据的观察模型的方法，如整合协变因子以更有效地解释数据噪声。",
