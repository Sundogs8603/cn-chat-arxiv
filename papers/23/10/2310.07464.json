    "translated_abstract": "生物标志物检测是低级别胶质瘤（LGG）诊断和治疗中不可或缺的一部分。然而，当前的LGG生物标志物检测方法依赖于昂贵而复杂的分子遗传学测试，需要专业人员分析结果，且常常存在内部一致性差异。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出了一种可解释的深度学习流程，即基于多实例学习（MIL）框架的多生物标志物组织形态学发现者（Multi-Beholder）模型，仅使用苏木精-伊红染色的全切片图像和切片级生物标志物状态标签预测LGG中五个生物标志物的状态。具体而言，通过将单类分类融入MIL框架，实现了准确的示例伪标签，用于实例级别监督，这极大地补充了切片级标签，并提高了生物标志物预测性能。 Multi-Beholder展示了优越的预测性能。",
