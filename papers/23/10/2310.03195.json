    "translated_abstract": "机器调度旨在通过满足制造规则和作业规范的前提下，优化作业分配给机器。这种优化可以降低运营成本、提高客户需求的满足度和增强生产效率。然而，由于其 NP-hard 的性质，机器调度仍然是一个具有挑战性的组合优化问题。深度强化学习(DRL)作为人工通用智能的关键组成部分，在游戏和机器人等领域已经显示出了潜力。自1995年以来，研究人员一直在探索将DRL应用于机器调度问题。本文对基于DRL的方法进行了全面的回顾和比较，重点介绍了它们的方法论、应用、优势和局限性。它将这些方法根据计算组件进行了分类：传统神经网络、编码器-解码器结构、图神经网络和元启发式算法。我们的回顾得出结论，基于DRL的方法优于精确求解器和启发式算法。",
