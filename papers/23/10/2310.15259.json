    "translated_abstract": "社区问答(CQA)平台是帮助组织内用户的有价值工具。然而，使它们对非英语用户可访问仍然是一个挑战。翻译问题可以拓宽社区的覆盖范围，使有类似问题的人能够受益，但在嘈杂的环境中使用神经机器翻译(NMT)进行问题翻译会面临更多挑战，因为这些问题的语法正确性没有受到监控。这些问题可能被非母语用户以陈述句的形式表达，具有不正确的主谓语序，甚至有时缺少问号。由于数据存在噪声，从这些数据中创建一个合成的平行语料库也是困难的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种只使用源语数据进行微调的训练方法。我们的方法通过结合BERTScore和Masked Language Model (MLM) S的损失函数，平衡了充分性和流畅性。",
