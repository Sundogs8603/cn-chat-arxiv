    "translated_abstract": "在学习从标签比例中学习（LLP）任务中，模型通过对实例组（称为bags）和相应的标签比例进行训练，以预测个体实例的标签。LLP主要应用于图像和表格两种数据集。在图像LLP中，通过从底层数据集中随机抽样实例来创建固定大小的bags。通过这种方法创建的bags称为随机bags。对图像LLP的实验主要集中在CIFAR-*和MNIST数据集的随机bags上。尽管表格LLP在隐私敏感应用中非常重要，但尚缺乏一个开放的、大规模的表格LLP基准。表格LLP的一个独特特性是能够创建特征bags，其中bag中的所有实例对于给定的特征具有相同的值。先前的研究表明，特征bags在实际的现实应用中非常常见。在本文中，我们解决了表格LLP的研究空白，提出了一个用于大规模表格LLP的基准。",
