    "translated_abstract": "听觉可以说是物理世界中人工智能（AI）代理的一个至关重要的能力，它涉及到对至少三种声音类型（语音、音频事件和音乐）的普通听觉信息的感知和理解。本文中，我们提出了SALMONN，一种语音音频语言音乐开放神经网络，它通过将预训练的基于文本的大型语言模型（LLM）与语音和音频编码器集成到单一多模态模型中进行构建。SALMONN使得LLM能够直接处理和理解普通音频输入，在训练中在许多语音和音频任务上取得了竞争性的表现，如自动语音识别和翻译、基于听觉信息的问题回答、情感识别、说话人验证以及音乐和音频字幕等。SALMONN还具有在训练中未见的各种新能力，包括但不限于对未训练语言的语音翻译。",
