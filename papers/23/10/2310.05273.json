    "abstract": "Scientific laws describing natural systems may be more complex than our intuition can handle, and thus how we discover laws must change. Machine learning (ML) models can analyze large quantities of data, but their structure should match the underlying physical constraints to provide useful insight. Here we demonstrate a ML approach that incorporates such physical intuition to infer force laws in dusty plasma experiments. Trained on 3D particle trajectories, the model accounts for inherent symmetries and non-identical particles, accurately learns the effective non-reciprocal forces between particles, and extracts each particle's mass and charge. The model's accuracy (R^2 > 0.99) points to new physics in dusty plasma beyond the resolution of current theories and demonstrates how ML-powered approaches can guide new routes of scientific discovery in many-body systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "描述自然系统的科学规律可能比我们的直觉更复杂，因此我们发现规律的方法必须改变。机器学习（ML）模型可以分析大量数据，但其结构应该符合基本的物理约束条件以提供有用的见解。在这里，我们展示了一种结合了物理直觉的ML方法，以推断尘埃等离子体实验中的力学法则。通过对3D粒子轨迹进行训练，该模型考虑了固有的对称性和非相同粒子之间的有效非互逆力，并提取出每个粒子的质量和电荷。模型的准确性（R^2 > 0.99）指示出尘埃等离子体中超出当前理论分辨率的新物理，并展示了机器学习驱动的方法如何引导多体系统中的科学发现的新途径。",
