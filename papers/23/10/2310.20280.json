    "abstract": "The efficiency of business processes relies on business key performance indicators (Biz-KPIs), that can be negatively impacted by IT failures. BizITOps data fuses both Biz-KPIs and IT event channels together as multivariate time series data. Forecasting Biz-KPIs in advance can enhance efficiency and revenue through proactive corrective measures. However, BizITOps data generally exhibit both useful and noisy inter-channel interactions between Biz-KPIs and IT events that need to be effectively decoupled.

To address this, we introduce AutoMixer, a time-series Foundation Model (FM) approach, grounded on the novel technique of channel-compressed pretrain and finetune workflows.

    "translated_abstract": "业务过程的效率依赖于业务关键绩效指标（Biz-KPIs），而IT故障可能对其产生负面影响。BizITOps数据将Biz-KPIs和IT事件通道融合成多变量时间序列数据。提前预测Biz-KPIs可以通过主动的纠正措施提高效率和收益。然而，BizITOps数据通常展示出Biz-KPIs和IT事件之间有用和嘈杂的跨通道交互，需要有效解耦。当使用现有的多变量预测模型时，这导致预测性能不佳。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一个称为AutoMixer的时间序列基础模型（FM）方法，该方法基于新颖的通道压缩预训练和微调工作流技术。AutoMixer利用自动编码器进行通道压缩的预训练，并将其与先进的TSMixer模型集成，用于多变量时间序列预测。这种融合极大地增强了TSM",
