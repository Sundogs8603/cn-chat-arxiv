    "translated_abstract": "现有的监督神经元分割方法的性能高度依赖于准确标注的数量，尤其是在应用于大规模电子显微镜（EM）数据时。通过从无标签数据中提取语义信息，自我监督方法可以提高下游任务的性能，其中掩蔽图像模型（MIM）由于其简单性和从掩蔽图像中恢复原始信息的有效性而被广泛使用。然而，由于EM图像中存在高度的结构局部性以及相当大的噪声，许多体元素包含很少区分信息，使得MIM预训练在神经元分割任务中效率低下。为了克服这一挑战，我们提出了一种基于决策的MIM，利用强化学习（RL）自动搜索最佳图像掩蔽比率和掩蔽策略。由于探索空间巨大，使用单智能体RL进行体元素预测是不切实际的。",
