    "abstract": "This study uncovers the factor of general intelligence, or g, in language models, extending the psychometric theory traditionally applied to humans and certain animal species. Utilizing factor analysis on two extensive datasets Open LLM Leaderboard with 1,232 models and General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) Leaderboard with 88 models - we find compelling evidence for a unidimensional, highly stable g factor that accounts for 85% of the variance in model performance. The study also finds a moderate correlation of .48 between model size and g. The discovery of g in language models offers a unified metric for model evaluation and opens new avenues for more robust, g-based model ability assessment. These findings lay the foundation for understanding and future research on artificial general intelligence from a psychometric perspective and have practical implications for model evaluation and development.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究采用心理测量理论，揭示了语言模型中普遍智能因子g的存在，并扩展了该理论在人类和某些动物物种中的应用。通过对两个大型数据集Open LLM Leaderboard（包含1,232个模型）和General Language Understanding Evaluation（GLUE）Leaderboard（包含88个模型）进行因子分析，我们发现了一个具有一维性和高度稳定性的g因子，可以解释模型性能方差的85%。研究还发现模型大小和g之间的中度相关性为0.48。在语言模型中发现g因子为模型评估提供了统一的指标，为更强大、基于g因子的模型能力评估开辟了新的途径。这些发现为从心理测量的角度理解和未来研究人工智能提供了基础，并对模型评估和开发具有实际意义。",
