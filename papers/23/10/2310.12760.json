    "abstract": "The social cost of carbon is the damage avoided by slightly reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It is a measure of the desired intensity of climate policy. The social cost of carbon is highly uncertain because of the long and complex cause-effect chain, and because it quantifies and aggregates impacts over a long period of time, affecting all people in a wide range of possible futures. Recent estimates are around $\\$$80/tCO$_2$.",
