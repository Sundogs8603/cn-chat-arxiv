    "abstract": "Code-switching (CS), i.e. mixing different languages in a single sentence, is a common phenomenon in communication and can be challenging in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) settings. Previous studies on CS speech have shown promising results for end-to-end speech translation (ST), but have been limited to offline scenarios and to translation to one of the languages present in the source (\\textit{monolingual transcription}).  In this paper, we focus on two essential yet unexplored areas for real-world CS speech translation: streaming settings, and translation to a third language (i.e., a language not included in the source). To this end, we extend the Fisher and Miami test and validation datasets to include new targets in Spanish and German. Using this data, we train a model for both offline and streaming ST and we establish baseline results for the two settings mentioned earlier.",

    "translated_abstract": "混合语言（CS）即在一句话中混合使用不同语言，是通信中常见的现象，在许多自然语言处理（NLP）环境下可能具有挑战性。先前关于CS语音的研究在端到端语音翻译（ST）方面取得了有希望的结果，但仅限于离线场景，并且仅能翻译成源语中的一种语言（单语转录）。本文着重研究了两个尚未探索的面向现实世界的CS语音翻译领域：流式设置和翻译到第三种语言（即源语中未包含的语言）。为此，我们扩展了Fisher和Miami测试和验证数据集，包含了西班牙语和德语作为新的目标语言。利用这些数据，我们对离线和流式ST模型进行训练，并建立了之前提到的两个设置的基线结果。",
