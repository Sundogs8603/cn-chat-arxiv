    "translated_abstract": "异构信息网络（HIN）通过元路径描述丰富的语义，已成为缓解推荐系统数据稀疏性的强大工具。现有的基于HIN的推荐系统持有数据的集中存储假设，并进行集中式模型训练。然而，由于隐私问题，现实世界的数据往往以分布式方式存储，导致集中式HIN推荐无法实现。本文提出将HIN分为客户端存储的私有HIN和服务器端的共享HIN。在此设置下，我们提出了一种基于联邦异构图神经网络（FedHGNN）的框架，可以在分布式HIN上协作训练推荐模型，同时不泄露用户隐私。具体而言，我们首先针对基于HIN的联合推荐，基于差分隐私的光下确定了隐私定义，旨在保护私有HIN的用户-商品交互，以及用户的隐私信息。",
