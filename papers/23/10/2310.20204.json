    "translated_abstract": "基于电子健康记录（EHRs）开发临床预测模型（例如死亡预测）通常依赖于专家意见进行特征选择和调整观测窗口大小。这给专家带来负担并在开发过程中造成瓶颈。我们提出了一种检索增强的医学预测模型（REMed），以应对这些挑战。REMed可以基本评估无限量的临床事件，选择相关的事件并进行预测。这种方法有效地消除了需要手动进行特征选择并实时观察的需要。我们通过对27个临床任务和两个公开可用的EHR数据集的独立队列实验验证了这些特性，结果显示REMed优于其他现代架构，它们旨在处理尽可能多的事件。值得注意的是，我们发现REMed的偏好与医学专家的偏好密切相似。我们期望我们的方法能显著加速该领域的发展。",
