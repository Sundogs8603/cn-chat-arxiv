    "translated_abstract": "预测化学反应是化学中一个基本的挑战，涉及从给定的反应过程中预测出产物。传统的技术，特别是使用图神经网络（GNN）的技术，通常受到训练数据不足和无法利用文本信息的限制，从而限制了它们在实际应用中的适用性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的框架ReLM，它利用语言模型（LM）中编码的化学知识来辅助GNN，从而提高了实际化学反应预测的准确性。为了进一步提高模型的鲁棒性和可解释性，我们还引入了置信度评分策略，使LM能够自我评估其预测的可靠性。我们的实验结果表明，ReLM改进了各种化学反应数据集上先进GNN方法的性能，特别是在超出分布范围的情况下。",
