    "translated_title": "全球经济秩序中的经济学：史诗级失败均衡的悲剧",
    "translated_abstract": "本文在一个统一的经济框架中阐述了全球经济秩序面临的一些关键挑战：去全球化、全球合作日益不可行以及大国竞争日益对抗性的特征。在这些挑战中，经济学已经被利用来服务于国家利益。这并不一定是件坏事。历史上有一些例子表明，当国家只追求自身利益时，更开放和自由的贸易可能会出现。但是，本文中描述的情况给出了一些混合信号。我们发现，一些发展确实体现了对经济和政治参与日益增长的零和感知。然而，仅仅依靠零和解释是明显不充分的。自私的国家，即使相信世界是零和的，也在某些情况下产生了使每个人受益的结果。在其他情况下，完全可以预测到的损失却导致了所有方面的失败。这种双输的结果就是史诗级失败均衡。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文在一个统一的经济框架中论述了全球经济秩序面临的关键挑战，包括去全球化、全球合作日益不可行以及大国竞争的对抗性特征。通过研究发现，自私的国家在某些情况下可以促进双赢结果，但也存在史诗级失败均衡的情况。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper discusses key challenges for the global economic order within a unified economic framework, such as de-globalization, the impracticability of global cooperation, and confrontational Great Power competition. The research reveals that self-serving nations can sometimes lead to win-win outcomes, but also highlights the existence of epic fail equilibria in certain circumstances."
