    "translated_title": "ChatGPT中的性别偏见有多普遍？—— 探索德语和英语ChatGPT的回应",
    "translated_abstract": "随着ChatGPT的推出，OpenAI使得大型语言模型（LLM）可供具有有限IT专业知识的用户使用。然而，没有自然语言处理（NLP）背景的用户可能缺乏对LLM的适当理解。因此，在处理系统输出时，缺乏对其固有限制的意识，将接受系统输出的表面价值。在本文中，我们系统地分析输入提示和生成的回应，以识别可能存在的问题，特别关注性别偏见问题，用户在处理系统输出时需要意识到这一点。我们探索了ChatGPT在英语和德语中的反应，并提供了女性、男性或中立角度的指令时，回复的是否有差异。通过深入调查，我们研究了一些选择的提示，并分析了系统在相同方式下多次提供指令时回应的差异程度。在此基础上，我们展示了对于帮助非IT用户撰写日常工作文本，ChatGPT确实非常有用。然而，当然至关重要的是要意识到，当处理系统输出时，用户需要充分考虑到其固有限制。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper systematically analyzes and explores potential issues in German and English ChatGPT responses, with a particular focus on gender bias. We found variations in responses when the system was prompted multiple times with the same instruction. While ChatGPT is useful for assisting non-IT users in drafting work texts, it is crucial for users to be aware of the inherent limitations of the system."
