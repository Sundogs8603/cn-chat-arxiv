    "translated_abstract": "我们为两个众所周知的高维私有估计任务提供了改进的下界。首先，我们证明，在近似差分隐私的情况下，对于用于估计高斯协方差的谱误差$\\alpha$，任意$\\alpha \\le O(1)$，需要$\\tilde{\\Omega} \\left(\\frac{d^{3/2}}{\\alpha \\varepsilon} + \\frac{d}{\\alpha^2}\\right)$个样本，这是紧凑的，仅差对数因子。这比先前的工作在$\\alpha \\le O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)$时建立的结果要好，并且比之前的工作更简单。接下来，我们证明，在近似差分隐私的情况下，对于有界$k$阶矩的重尾分布的均值估计，需要$\\tilde{\\Omega}\\left(\\frac{d}{\\alpha^{k/(k-1)} \\varepsilon} + \\frac{d}{\\alpha^2}\\right)$个样本。这与已知的上界相吻合，并改进了此问题的已知最佳下界，该下界仅适用于纯粹的差分隐私或$k = 2$的情况。我们的技术遵循指纹方式的方法。",
