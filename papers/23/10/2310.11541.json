In both the textual and phonetic domains, our method focuses on the extraction of phonetic transcriptions from text, stress marks, and a unified automatic syllabification (in text and phonetic domains). The system was built with open-source components and resources. Through an ablation study, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in automatically syllabifying words from several languages (English, French and Spanish).

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了一种语言特征提取的方法，特别关注多种语言中自动音节化单词，并设计与强制对齐工具Montreal Forced Aligner（MFA）兼容。在文本和音韵领域中，我们的方法专注于从文本中提取音标转录、重音标记和统一的自动音节化。该系统采用了开源组件和资源构建。通过消融研究，我们证明了我们的方法在自动音节化多种语言（英语、法语和西班牙语）的单词方面的有效性。此外，我们将该技术应用于CMU ARCTIC数据集的转录中，生成了有助于语音表示学习、语音单元发现和语音因素解缠的宝贵注释，在线可用。",
