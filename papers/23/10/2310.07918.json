    "translated_abstract": "可解释的策略学习旨在从观察到的行为中估计可理解的决策策略；然而，现有模型在准确性和可解释性之间存在权衡。这种权衡限制了基于数据驱动的对人类决策过程的解释，例如，审计医疗决策的偏见和次优实践，我们需要决策过程的模型，能够提供复杂行为的简洁描述。现有方法基本上由于将潜在决策过程表示为通用策略而负担了这种权衡，而实际上人类决策是动态的，可以随上下文信息而大幅改变。因此，我们提出了上下文化政策恢复（CPR），将建模复杂决策过程的问题重新定义为多任务学习问题，其中复杂决策策略由特定上下文的策略组成。CPR将每个上下文特定策略建模为线性的观察-动作映射",
