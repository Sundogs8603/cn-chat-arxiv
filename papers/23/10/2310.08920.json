    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了Easymark，这是一种极其简单但非常有效的水印方法。随着大型语言模型（LLM）的出现，文本水印变得越来越重要。LLM可以生成与人类写作的文本无法区分的文本，这对文本的可信度是一个严重的问题。Easymark是这个问题的一个简单而有效的解决方案。Easymark可以在不改变文本含义的情况下注入水印，而验证器可以高度可信地检测出文本是否由采用Easymark的系统生成。Easymark非常容易实现，只需要几行代码。Easymark不需要访问LLMs，因此当LLM提供者不提供带水印的LLM时，可以在用户端实施。尽管它很简单，但它能够实现比最先进的文本水印方法更高的检测准确度和BLEU分数。我们还证明了完美水印的不可能定理。",
