    "translated_abstract": "本研究利用深度学习的方法，基于脑电图脑部记录，进行精神分裂症的自动诊断。该方法利用生成式数据增强技术，提高了诊断的准确性。为了能够利用时频特征，从原始信号中提取了频谱图。在探索了多种神经网络结构设置后，选择了适合的卷积神经网络(CNN)进行初步诊断。随后，利用Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty(WGAN-GP)和变分自动编码器(VAE)生成了两个不同的合成数据集，以增强初始数据集并解决过拟合问题。使用VAE生成的增强数据集在准确度上提高了3.0％，达到了99.0％，同时得到了更低的损失值和更快的收敛速度。最后，我们使用局部可解释的模型无关解释(LIME)方法解决了对于黑盒模型的信任缺乏问题。",
