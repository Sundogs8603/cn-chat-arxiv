    "translated_abstract": "随着数据通信越来越多地利用无线网络，工业网络物理系统的网络安全引起了巨大关注。许多数据驱动方法被开发用于检测网络攻击，但很少有方法专注于区分网络攻击和设备故障。本文开发了一个数据驱动框架，可用于检测、诊断和定位一种称为隐蔽攻击的网络工业控制系统的网络攻击。该框架采用了变分自编码器(VAE)、循环神经网络(RNN)和深度神经网络(DNN)的混合设计。该数据驱动框架考虑了一个通用物理系统的时间行为，从传感器测量的时间序列中提取特征用于检测隐蔽攻击、区分它们与设备故障以及定位攻击/故障。通过对一个仿真实验中的实际模拟研究来评估所提出方法的性能。",
