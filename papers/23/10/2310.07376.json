    "abstract": "The digitalization of society is rapidly developing toward the realization of the digital twin and metaverse. In particular, point clouds are attracting attention as a media format for 3D space. Point cloud data is contaminated with noise and outliers due to measurement errors. Therefore, denoising and outlier detection are necessary for point cloud processing. Among them, PointCleanNet is an effective method for point cloud denoising and outlier detection. However, it does not consider the local geometric structure of the patch. We solve this problem by applying two types of graph convolutional layer designed based on the Dynamic Graph CNN. Experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform the conventional method in AUPR, which indicates outlier detection accuracy, and Chamfer Distance, which indicates denoising accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "社会的数字化快速发展正在朝着实现数字孪生和元宇宙的目标迈进。特别是，点云作为3D空间的一种媒体格式正在引起关注。由于测量误差，点云数据受到噪声和异常值的污染。因此，对点云进行去噪和异常检测是必要的。其中，PointCleanNet是一种有效的点云去噪和异常检测方法。然而，它没有考虑到补丁的局部几何结构。我们通过应用基于动态图卷积神经网络设计的两种类型的图卷积层来解决这个问题。实验结果表明，所提出的方法在衡量异常检测准确性的AUPR和衡量去噪准确性的Chamfer距离方面优于传统方法。",
