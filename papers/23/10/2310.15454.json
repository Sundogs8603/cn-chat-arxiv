    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一类私有学习问题，其中数据是私有特征和公共特征的联结。这在私人个性化任务中经常出现，例如推荐或广告预测，在这些任务中，与个人相关的特征是敏感的，而与物品相关的特征（如推荐的电影或歌曲，或者向用户展示的广告）是公开可用的并且不需要保护。一个自然的问题是，在公共特征存在的情况下，私有算法是否能够实现更高的实用性。我们对多编码器模型进行了研究，其中一个编码器处理公共特征。我们开发了新的算法，利用这种分离只保护某些充分统计量（而不是向梯度添加噪音）。这种方法在线性回归中保证了实用性改进，并且在两个标准私有推荐基准测试中取得了最新的成果，证明了方法的重要性。",
