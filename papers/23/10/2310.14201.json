    "translated_abstract": "提示工程（PE）已经成为指导大型语言模型（LLM）解决复杂任务的关键技术。它的重要性在于其潜力可以显著提高人机交互的效率和效果。随着任务变得越来越复杂，最近的高级PE方法已经超越了单轮交互的限制，而是采用了多轮交互，这样可以更加深入和细致地与LLM进行交互。在本文中，我们提出了一个针对LLM的多轮交互的最优控制框架。该框架提供了统一的数学结构，不仅系统化了现有的提示工程方法，还为严谨的分析改进奠定了基础。此外，我们还将该框架扩展到包括通过集合方法和多智能体协作的提示工程，从而扩大了适用范围。通过采用最优控制的视角，我们对现有提示工程方法提供了新的见解。",
