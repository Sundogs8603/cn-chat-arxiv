    "translated_abstract": "在数字时代，误导和虚假信息正在迅速在各种语言和边界间传播，构成了日益增长的威胁。本文通过对95种语言中超过250,000个唯一事实核查的分析，探究了多语言错误信息的普遍性和动态性。首先，我们发现大多数错误信息主张仅被事实核查一次，但11.7%的主张(超过21,000个)被核查多次。运用事实核查作为错误信息传播的代理指标，我们发现33%的重复主张穿越语言障碍，暗示部分错误信息渗透了语言边界。然而，扩散模式表现出较强的同质性，错误信息更有可能在相同语言中传播。为研究主张随时间的演变和跨语言的突变，我们使用多语言句子嵌入来表示事实核查，并对语义相似的主张进行聚类。我们分析了连接组件和最短路径。",
