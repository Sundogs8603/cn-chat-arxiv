    "translated_abstract": "在现代地球观测技术诞生之前，历史地图提供了有关地球表面的有用时空信息。为了从地图中提取信息，近年来广受欢迎的神经网络已经取代了手工制作的地图处理方法和繁琐的手工劳动。然而，由于原始地图表面的绘制/扫描/褪色缺陷以及将地图裁剪成小块考虑训练过程的内存限制时所产生的不充分上下文，导致了数据相关的不确定性，挑战模型进行正确预测。由于即使收集更多的训练数据，数据相关的不确定性也不能降低，因此我们认为互补的时空上下文可能会有所帮助。为了实现这一点，我们提出了一个基于U-Net的网络，它使用跨关注的变换器（U-SpaTem）融合时空特征，以在更大的空间范围和时间序列中汇集信息。",
