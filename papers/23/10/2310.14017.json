    "translated_abstract": "在医疗时间序列分析中，对比表示学习至关重要，因为它减少了对劳动密集、领域特定和稀缺的专家注释的依赖。然而，现有的对比学习方法主要关注单一数据层面，未能充分利用医疗时间序列的复杂特性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了COMET，一个创新的层次框架，它利用医疗时间序列中所有内在层级的数据一致性。我们精心设计的模型系统地捕捉了来自四个潜在层级的数据一致性：观测、样本、试验和患者层级。通过在多个层级上开发对比损失，我们可以学习到保持全面数据一致性的有效表示，实现自监督方法中的信息最大利用。我们在具有挑战性的独立患者设置下进行实验。我们使用三个不同的数据集将COMET与六个基准方法进行比较。",
