    "abstract": "While question answering over knowledge bases (KBQA) has shown progress in addressing factoid questions, KBQA with numerical reasoning remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we focus on the complex numerical reasoning in KBQA and propose a new task, NR-KBQA, which necessitates the ability to perform both multi-hop reasoning and numerical reasoning. We design a logic form in Python format called PyQL to represent the reasoning process of numerical reasoning questions. To facilitate the development of NR-KBQA, we present a large dataset called MarkQA, which is automatically constructed from a small set of seeds. Each question in MarkQA is equipped with its corresponding SPARQL query, alongside the step-by-step reasoning process in the QDMR format and PyQL program. Experimental results of some state-of-the-art QA methods on the MarkQA show that complex numerical reasoning in KBQA faces great challenges.",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然知识库问答（KBQA）在解决事实型问题方面取得了进展，但是涉及数值推理的KBQA相对较少研究。本文针对KBQA中复杂的数值推理问题，提出了一个新的任务，NR-KBQA，它需要进行多跳推理和数值推理。我们设计了一种以Python格式的逻辑形式PyQL来表示数值推理问题的推理过程。为了便于NR-KBQA的开发，我们提供了一个名为MarkQA的大规模数据集，该数据集是从一小组种子自动构建的。MarkQA中的每个问题都配备了与之对应的SPARQL查询，以及以QDMR格式和PyQL程序表示的逐步推理过程。一些最先进的QA方法在MarkQA上的实验结果表明，KBQA中的复杂数值推理面临着巨大的挑战。",
