    "translated_abstract": "我们对重复委托选择问题进行了研究，这是第一个考虑克莱因伯格和克莱因伯格(EC'18)在线学习变种的模型。在该模型中，一个委托人与一个拥有外生解集的代理人进行重复互动，以寻找高效的解决方案。每个解决方案对委托人和代理人都可以产生不同的效用，代理人可能以自私的方式提出解决方案，以最大化自身的效用。为了减轻这种行为，委托人宣布一个合格集合，筛掉一定的解决方案。然而，委托人事先并不了解解决方案的分布情况。因此，委托人动态地宣布各种合格集合，以有效地学习分布。委托人的目标是最小化与事后最优合格集合相比的累积后悔。我们探讨了问题设置的两个维度，即代理人是根据眼前利益行事还是在回合之间制定策略。",
