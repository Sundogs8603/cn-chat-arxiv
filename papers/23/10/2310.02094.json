    "translated_abstract": "神经算子扩展了数据驱动模型，用于映射无限维函数空间之间的关系。这些模型成功地解决了由微分方程表示的连续动力学系统，如天气预报、流体流动或固体力学。然而，现有的算子仍然依赖于实数空间，因此无法捕捉到在复数空间中通过函数变换可能捕捉到的丰富表示。在本文中，我们引入了一种复杂神经算子（CoNO），该算子在复分数傅里叶域中参数化积分核。另外，使用复值神经网络和无混叠激活函数的模型保留了复数值和复代数特性，从而提供了更好的表示能力、对噪声的稳健性和泛化性能。我们展示了该模型能够通过单一的复分数傅里叶变换有效地捕捉到潜在的偏微分方程。我们进行了大量的实证评估。",
