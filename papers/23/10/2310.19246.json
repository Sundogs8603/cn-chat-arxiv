    "translated_abstract": "潜变量模型（LVMs）常用于捕捉观测数据中的潜在依赖关系、模式和隐藏结构。数据hankel化的预处理步骤导致源复制，这是单通道LVM应用中的一个副产品，阻碍了实际的LVM利用。本文介绍了一个名为spectrally-regularised-LVMs的Python包。该包通过引入一项新的谱正则化项来解决源复制问题。该包提供了一个用于单通道LVM应用的谱正则化框架，从而更容易地研究和利用带有谱正则化的LVMs。这通过将潜变量模型目标函数的符号或显式表示纳入到一个框架中，在LVM参数估计过程中使用谱正则化来实现。该包的目标是提供一种一致的线性LVM优化框架。",
