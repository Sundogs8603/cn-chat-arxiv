    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a revolution in AI. However, they also pose many significant risks, such as the presence of biased, private, copyrighted or harmful text. For this reason we need open, transparent and safe solutions. We introduce a complete open-source ecosystem for developing and testing LLMs. The goal of this project is to boost open alternatives to closed-source approaches. We release h2oGPT, a family of fine-tuned LLMs from 7 to 70 Billion parameters. We also introduce H2O LLM Studio, a framework and no-code GUI designed for efficient fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment of LLMs using the most recent state-of-the-art techniques. Our code and models are licensed under fully permissive Apache 2.0 licenses. We believe open-source language models help to boost AI development and make it more accessible and trustworthy.

    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLMs）代表了人工智能的一项革命。然而，它们也带来了许多重大风险，例如存在偏见、私有、受版权保护或有害的文本。因此，我们需要开放、透明和安全的解决方案。我们介绍了一个完整的开源生态系统，用于开发和测试LLMs。该项目的目标是推动对封闭源方法的开放式替代方案。我们发布了h2oGPT，即从70亿到700亿参数的一系列精细调整的LLMs。我们还推出了H2O LLM Studio，这是一个框架和无代码GUI，专为使用最新的先进技术进行LLMs的高效精细调整、评估和部署而设计。我们的代码和模型在完全自由的Apache 2.0许可证下授权使用。我们相信开源语言模型有助于推动人工智能的发展，并使其更可访问和可信赖。演示网址为：https://gpt.h2o.ai/",
