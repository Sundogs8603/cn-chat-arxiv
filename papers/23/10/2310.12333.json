    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the Black-Litterman (BL) asset allocation model (Black and Litterman, 1990) under the hidden truncation skew-normal distribution (Arnold and Beaver, 2000). In particular, when returns are assumed to follow this skew normal distribution, we show that the posterior returns, after incorporating views, are also skew normal. By using Simaan three moments risk model (Simaan, 1993), we could then obtain the optimal portfolio. Empirical data show that the optimal portfolio obtained this way has less risk compared to an optimal portfolio of the classical BL model and that they become more negatively skewed as the expected returns of portfolios increase, which suggests that the investors trade a negative skewness for a higher expected return. We also observe a negative relation between portfolio volatility and portfolio skewness. This observation suggests that investors may be making a trade-off, opting for lower volatility in exchange for higher skewness, or vice versa. ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了Black-Litterman （BL）资产配置模型（Black和Litterman, 1990）在隐藏截尾偏态正态分布（Arnold和Beaver, 2000）下的应用。特别地，当假设收益率遵循这种偏态正态分布时，我们证明了加入观点后的后验收益率也服从偏态正态分布。通过使用Simaan三个时刻风险模型（Simaan, 1993），我们可以得到最优化投资组合。实证数据表明，用这种方式获得的最优投资组合相对于传统的BL模型的优点是风险更小，并且随着投资组合的预期收益增加，它们的偏度变得更加负向，这表明投资者通过负偏度换取更高的预期收益。我们还观察到投资组合波动性与偏度之间存在负相关关系。这一观察表明投资者可能会做出权衡，以更低的波动性换取更高的偏度，反之亦然。",
