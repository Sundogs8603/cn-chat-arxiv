    "abstract": "This thesis provides an overview of the recent advances in reinforcement learning in pricing and hedging financial instruments, with a primary focus on a detailed explanation of the Q-Learning Black Scholes approach, introduced by Halperin (2017). This reinforcement learning approach bridges the traditional Black and Scholes (1973) model with novel artificial intelligence algorithms, enabling option pricing and hedging in a completely model-free and data-driven way. This paper also explores the algorithm's performance under different state variables and scenarios for a European put option. The results reveal that the model is an accurate estimator under different levels of volatility and hedging frequency. Moreover, this method exhibits robust performance across various levels of option's moneyness. Lastly, the algorithm incorporates proportional transaction costs, indicating diverse impacts on profit and loss, affected by different statistical properties of the state variables.",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文概述了近年来在金融产品定价和对冲中应用强化学习的最新进展，重点介绍了由Halperin（2017）提出的Q学习Black Scholes方法的详细解释。这种强化学习方法将传统的Black and Scholes（1973）模型与新颖的人工智能算法相结合，以完全的非模型和数据驱动的方式进行期权定价和对冲。本文还研究了该算法在不同状态变量和场景下对欧式看跌期权的表现。结果表明，该模型在不同波动率和对冲频率水平下具有较高的准确性。此外，该方法在不同期权平价点的水平上表现出稳健的性能。最后，该算法包括比例交易成本，表明不同状态变量的统计特性对收益和损失产生不同的影响。",
