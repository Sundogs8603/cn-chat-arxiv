    "abstract": "A typical neural speech enhancement (SE) approach mainly handles speech and noise mixtures, which is not optimal for singing voice enhancement scenarios. Music source separation (MSS) models treat vocals and various accompaniment components equally, which may reduce performance compared to the model that only considers vocal enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-band temporal-frequency neural network (MBTFNet) for singing voice enhancement, which particularly removes background music, noise and even backing vocals from singing recordings. MBTFNet combines inter and intra-band modeling for better processing of full-band signals. Dual-path modeling are introduced to expand the receptive field of the model. We propose an implicit personalized enhancement (IPE) stage based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) estimation, which further improves the performance of MBTFNet. Experiments show that our proposed model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art SE and MSS models.",

    "translated_abstract": "传统的神经音频增强方法主要处理语音和噪声混合的情况，这对于歌声增强场景并不是最优的。音乐源分离模型将人声和伴奏组件视作同等重要，这可能会降低性能，相对于仅考虑人声增强的模型。本文提出了一种新颖的多频带时间频率神经网络（MBTFNet），用于歌声增强，可以从歌唱录音中去除背景音乐、噪声甚至和声。MBTFNet结合了带间和带内建模，以更好地处理全频带信号。引入了双通道建模来扩大模型的感受野。我们提出了一种基于信噪比（SNR）估计的隐式个性化增强（IPE）阶段，进一步提高了MBTFNet的性能。实验证明，我们提出的模型明显优于多个最先进的音频增强和音乐源分离模型。",
