We delineate a novel State Augmentation (SA) strategy to maximize the aggregate information at source nodes using graph neural network (GNN) architectures, by deploying graph convolutions over the topological links of the communication network. The proposed technique leverages only the local information available at each node and efficiently routes desired information to the destination nodes. We leverage an unsupervised learning procedure to convert the output of the GNN architecture to optimal information routing strategies. In the experiments, we perform the evaluation on real-time network topologies to validate our algorithms.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在大规模通信网络中的信息路由问题，该问题可以被形式化为一个只能访问局部信息的约束统计学习问题。我们提出了一种新颖的状态增强（SA）策略，通过在通信网络的拓扑链路上部署图神经网络（GNN）架构，利用图卷积来最大化源节点的聚合信息。所提出的技术仅利用每个节点上的局部信息，并有效地将所需的信息路由到目标节点。我们利用无监督学习过程将GNN架构的输出转换为最优的信息路由策略。实验中，我们对实时网络拓扑进行评估，以验证我们的算法。数值仿真结果显示出与基线算法相比，所提出的方法在训练GNN参数化方面的性能有所提高。",
