We propose an approach that leverages the power of web search and generative models to alleviate some of the shortcomings of discriminative models. We demonstrate our method on an image classification problem using ImageNet's People Subtree subset, and show that it is effective in enhancing robustness and mitigating bias in certain classes that represent vulnerable populations (e.g., female doctor of color). Our new method is able to (1) identify weak decision boundaries for such classes; (2) construct search queries for Google as well as text for generating images through DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion; a",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）技术众所周知存在伦理和运营问题，然而我们目睹到越来越多的企业致力于在敏感应用中部署它们。其中一个主要问题是ML模型对于代表少数群体的样本表现不一致。这使得弱势群体处于更不利和不公平的位置。我们提出了一种利用网络搜索和生成模型的方法，以减轻判别模型的一些缺点。我们在一个图像分类问题上演示了我们的方法，使用ImageNet的人类子树子集，并展示它在增强鲁棒性和减轻偏见方面对某些代表弱势群体（例如，有色人种女性医生）的类别是有效的。我们的新方法能够：（1）识别这些类别的弱决策边界；（2）为谷歌构建搜索查询，并通过DALL-E 2和稳定扩散生成图像的文本。",
