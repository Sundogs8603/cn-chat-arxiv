    "translated_abstract": "不完整的多视图聚类(IMVC)由于样本的某些视图在现实中常常是不完整的，因此受到了越来越多的关注。大多数现有的方法从原始的不完整的多视图数据中学习相似度子图，并通过探索每个视图的不完整子图来寻找完整的图形进行谱聚类。然而，基于原始高维数据构建的图可能由于特征冗余和噪声而是次优的。此外，之前的方法通常忽略了不完整图和完整图之间的类内和类间结构变化引起的图噪声。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的基于联合投影学习和张量分解的方法(JPLTD)用于IMVC。具体地，为了减轻高维数据中冗余特征和噪声的影响，JPLTD引入了一个正交投影矩阵将高维特征投影到一个低维空间中。",
