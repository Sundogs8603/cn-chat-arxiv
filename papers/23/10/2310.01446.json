    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLM)在处理复杂推理任务时展示了令人印象深刻的能力。在现实世界中，问题往往涉及各种复杂性。人类本能地根据任务的复杂性调整他们的问题解决方法。然而，大多数利用LLM的方法倾向于采用一种统一的方法: 不管问题的复杂性如何，都使用一致的模型、提示方法和问题分解程度。这种刚性可能会带来不必要的计算开销或次优的性能。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一个自适应求解器框架。它根据问题的难度策略性地调整求解策略。给定一个初始解决方案，该框架使用两个主要模块。初始评估模块评估当前解决方案的充分性。如果需要改进，接下来的自适应模块会介入。在这个模块内，有三个关键的自适应策略。",
