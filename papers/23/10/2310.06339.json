    "translated_abstract": "超声是健康筛查中重要的诊断技术，具有无创、经济、无辐射等优点，因此在结节的诊断中被广泛应用。然而，超声图像中，单个结节在不同的切面视图下可能呈现出异质的外观，这使得逐个结节检查变得困难。超声检查通常依赖于超声师的专业知识和临床经验。超声师通常通过检查结节特征和周围结构（如腺体和导管）来区分不同的结节，这是繁琐且耗时的。为了解决这个问题，我们收集了数百个乳腺超声视频，并建立了一个结节重新识别系统，包括基于深度学习模型的提取器，可以从输入视频片段中提取特征向量，以及实时聚类算法，可以自动将特征向量按结节分组。该系统获得了令人满意的结果。",
