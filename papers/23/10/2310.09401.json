    "translated_abstract": "个性化新闻推荐旨在帮助用户找到与其兴趣相符的新闻文章，这在缓解用户信息过载问题方面起到至关重要的作用。尽管许多最近的研究致力于改进用户和新闻的表示方法，但以下挑战很少被研究：（C1）如何准确理解一篇新闻文章中包含的多个意图？以及（C2）如何区分用户点击历史中对新闻文章有不同后阅读偏好的情况？为了同时解决这两个挑战，在本文中，我们提出了一种新的个性化新闻推荐框架（CIDER），它利用（1）基于类别引导的意图分离来解决（C1）和（2）基于一致性的新闻表示来解决（C2）。此外，我们将类别预测纳入CIDER的训练过程作为辅助任务，这提供了额外的监督信号，以增强意图分离。在两个真实数据集上进行了广泛的实验。",
