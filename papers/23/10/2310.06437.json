    "abstract": "Skeleton Ground Truth (GT) is critical to the success of supervised skeleton extraction methods, especially with the popularity of deep learning techniques. Furthermore, we see skeleton GTs used not only for training skeleton detectors with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) but also for evaluating skeleton-related pruning and matching algorithms. However, most existing shape and image datasets suffer from the lack of skeleton GT and inconsistency of GT standards. As a result, it is difficult to evaluate and reproduce CNN-based skeleton detectors and algorithms on a fair basis. In this paper, we present a heuristic strategy for object skeleton GT extraction in binary shapes and natural images. Our strategy is built on an extended theory of diagnosticity hypothesis, which enables encoding human-in-the-loop GT extraction based on clues from the target's context, simplicity, and completeness. Using this strategy, we developed a tool, SkeView, to generate skeleton GT of 17 existing shape ",

    "translated_abstract": "骨骼地面实况（GT）对于监督式骨骼提取方法的成功至关重要，尤其是在深度学习技术的流行之下。此外，我们还看到骨骼 GT 不仅用于用于训练卷积神经网络（CNN）的骨骼检测器，还用于评估与骨骼相关的修剪和匹配算法。然而，大多数现有的形状和图像数据集在骨骼 GT 的缺乏和 GT 标准的不一致性方面存在问题。因此，很难公平地评估和复现基于 CNN 的骨骼检测器和算法。在本文中，我们提出了一种在二元形状和自然图像中提取骨骼 GT 的启发式策略。我们的策略建立在诊断性假设的扩展理论上，这使得人-数据回路的 GT 提取可以基于目标的上下文、简单性和完整性的线索来进行编码。使用这个策略，我们开发了一个工具，SkeView，用于生成17个现有形状数据集的骨骼 GT。",
