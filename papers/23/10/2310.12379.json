However, this is less suitable for words that are only indirectly related and it does not readily allow us to incorporate structured domain knowledge. In this paper, we aim to combine the best of both worlds. We model relations as paths but associate their edges with relation embeddings.

    "translated_abstract": "在词汇语义学中，建模概念之间的关系是一个核心主题。一个常见策略是依赖于知识图谱（KGs）如ConceptNet，并将两个概念之间的关系建模为一组路径。然而，KGs仅限于固定的关系类型，不完整并且通常嘈杂。另一个策略是从微调的语言模型中提炼关系嵌入。然而，对于只间接相关的词来说，这种方法不太适用，并且不容易将结构化领域知识整合进来。在本文中，我们旨在结合两者的优点。我们将关系建模为路径，但将其边缘与关系嵌入相关联。首先，通过识别合适的中间词语来获取路径，然后选择那些可以获得有信息量的关系嵌入的词语。我们经验证明，我们提出的表示方法对于解决困难的类比问题是有用的。",
