Several datasets have been build with the goal of training computational models for code-mixing. Although it is very common to observe code-mixing with multiple languages, most datasets available contain code-mixed between only two languages. In this paper, we introduce SentMix-3L, a novel dataset for sentiment analysis containing code-mixed data between three languages Bangla, English, and Hindi. We carry out a comprehensive evaluation using SentMix-3L. We show that zero-shot prompting with GPT-3.5 outperforms all transformer-based models on SentMix-3L.",

    "translated_abstract": "代码混合是一种研究很深的语言现象，指的是在文本或语音中混合使用两种或更多语言。已经构建了几个旨在训练代码混合计算模型的数据集。尽管多语言的代码混合很常见，但大多数可用的数据集只包含两种语言的代码混合。本文介绍了SentMix-3L，这是一个新颖的用于情感分析的数据集，其中包含孟加拉语、英语和印地语之间的代码混合数据。我们使用SentMix-3L进行了全面评估。我们展示了使用GPT-3.5进行零-shot提示在SentMix-3L上优于所有基于转换器的模型。",
