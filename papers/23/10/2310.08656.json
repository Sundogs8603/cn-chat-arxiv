    "translated_abstract": "现代IEEE 802.11（Wi-Fi）网络广泛依赖多输入多输出（MIMO）来显著提高吞吐量。为了正确进行MIMO传输的波束成形，接入点需要频繁地从每个连接的站点获取波束成形矩阵（BM）。然而，矩阵的大小随着天线和子载波的数量增加而增大，导致空间中的开销和站点的计算负载不断增加。传统方法要么计算负载过大，要么波束成形精度不高。因此，我们提出了SplitBeam，一个新的框架，在该框架中，我们训练一个分割的深度神经网络（DNN），直接根据输入的信道状态信息（CSI）矩阵输出BM。我们制定并解决了一个瓶颈优化问题（BOP），以保持计算、空间中的开销和误码率（BER）低于应用要求。我们使用现成的Wi-Fi设备进行了广泛的实验性CSI收集，在两个不同的环境中收集数据。",
