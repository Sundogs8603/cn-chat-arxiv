    "translated_abstract": "最近自然语言处理领域的新进展，主要是由大型语言模型（LLMs）推动的，展示了它们在上下文学习方面的显著能力。在复杂推理任务中引导LLMs的一个有前途的途径是利用链式思维（CoT）范式中的中间推理步骤。然而，最主要的挑战在于有效地选择示例来促进上下文学习。在这项研究中，我们引入了一个框架，利用双重查询和低秩近似重新排序（DQ-LoRe）来自动选择用于上下文学习的示例。双重查询首先查询LLM以获取LLM生成的知识，例如CoT，然后通过问题和知识查询检索器以获取最终的示例。此外，对于第二个查询，LoRe利用降维技术来改进示例选择，确保与输入问题的知识密切对齐。通过广泛的实验验证了DQ-LoRe框架的有效性和性能。",
