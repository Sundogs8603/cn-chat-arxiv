    "translated_abstract": "最近有符号图神经网络（SGNNs）引起了更多关注，因为许多现实世界的网络是由正负两种类型的边组成的。负边的存在影响了SGNN在两个方面的稳健性。其一是语义不平衡，因为负边通常很难获得，尽管它们可能提供潜在有用的信息。其二是结构不平衡，例如不平衡的三角形，它们表示节点之间的不兼容关系。本文提出了一种平衡增强方法来解决SGNN的上述两个方面问题。首先，通过计算负边在不平衡结构中的出现次数来衡量每个负边的效用。其次，通过（1）边扰动调节器平衡正负边的数量，并确定扰动边与原始边的比率和（2）边效用过滤器选择性地增强原始有符号图，以去除负边。",
