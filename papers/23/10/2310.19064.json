    "abstract": "In online binary classification under \\textit{apple tasting} feedback, the learner only observes the true label if it predicts \"1\". First studied by \\cite{helmbold2000apple}, we revisit this classical partial-feedback setting and study online learnability from a combinatorial perspective. We show that the Littlestone dimension continues to prove a tight quantitative characterization of apple tasting in the agnostic setting, closing an open question posed by \\cite{helmbold2000apple}. In addition, we give a new combinatorial parameter, called the Effective width, that tightly quantifies the minimax expected mistakes in the realizable setting. As a corollary, we use the Effective width to establish a \\textit{trichotomy} of the minimax expected number of mistakes in the realizable setting. In particular, we show that in the realizable setting, the expected number of mistakes for any learner under apple tasting feedback can only be $\\Theta(1), \\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$, or $\\Theta(T)$.",

    "translated_abstract": "在在线二元分类中，学习者只有在预测为\"1\"时观察到真实标签。本文重新研究了这种经典的部分反馈设置，并从组合角度研究了在线可学习性。我们证明了在不可知设置下，Littlestone维度仍然是苹果品尝的紧密定量刻画，解决了\\cite{helmbold2000apple}提出的一个悬而未决的问题。此外，我们给出了一个新的组合参数，称为有效宽度，紧密量化了在可实现设置中的极小期望错误。作为推论，我们使用有效宽度在可实现设置中建立了极小期望错误数量的三分法。特别地，我们证明了在可实现设置中，任何学习者在苹果品尝反馈下的期望错误数量只能是$\\Theta(1), \\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$, 或 $\\Theta(T)$。",
