    "translated_abstract": "在机器人领域中，实现类似于人类灵巧操纵的能力仍然是一个关键的研究领域。现有的研究主要集中在提高拿取和放置任务的成功率上。与拿取和放置相比，抛接行为有潜力在无需将物体运送到目的地的情况下提高拿取速度。然而，动态的灵巧操纵由于大量的动态接触而面临着稳定控制的重大挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种稳定约束强化学习（SCRL）算法，用于学习用灵巧的手捕捉多样化的物体。该算法在基线方法上取得了很大的优势，并且学习到的策略在未见过的物体上表现出了强大的零-shot迁移性能。值得注意的是，即使手中的物体面向侧面非常不稳定，由于缺乏来自手掌的支撑，我们的方法仍然可以在最具挑战的任务中取得很高的成功率。我们还展示了学到的行为的视频演示和合作结果。",
