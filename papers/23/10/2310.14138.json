    "translated_abstract": "大多数健康经济分析都依赖于计算机。然而，将健康经济模型作为软件（或计算健康经济模型（CHEMs））实施的伦理维度尚不明确。我们提出CHEMs的开发者和资助者对（i）建立社会可接受的用户需求和设计规范，（ii）确保适合目的，以及（iii）支持社会有益的使用承担伦理责任。我们进一步提出一个透明（T）、可重用（R）和可更新（U）的CHEM表明项目团队在很大程度上已履行这些责任。我们提出了六个评估CHEMs的标准：（T1）软件文件开放获取；（T2）项目团队的贡献和判断易于识别；（R1）编程实践促进了通用性和可转移性；（R2）许可证仅限制不道德的重用；（U1）维护基础设施已经就绪；以及（U2）新版本经过系统重新测试和批准。",
