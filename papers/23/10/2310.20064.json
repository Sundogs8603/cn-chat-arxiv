    "translated_abstract": "尽管最近取得了一些进展，但是开发通用的去噪和去伪影网络仍然是一个尚未解决的问题：给定固定的网络权重，一个任务（例如去除泊松噪声）的专门化与另一个任务（例如去除斑点噪声）的性能之间存在天然的权衡。此外，由于维度的诅咒，训练这样的网络是具有挑战性的：随着规格空间的维度增加（即需要描述噪声分布所需的参数数量增加），需要训练的唯一规格数量呈指数增长。均匀采样这个空间会导致网络在非常具有挑战性的问题规格上表现良好，但在简单的问题规格上表现不佳，即使大误差也对总体均方误差的影响很小。本文提出了一种使用自适应采样/主动学习策略来训练去噪网络的方法。我们的工作改进了最近提出的一种方法。",
