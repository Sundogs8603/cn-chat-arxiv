    "translated_abstract": "高斯过程回归是一种流行的回归方法，与大多数机器学习技术不同，它提供了其预测的不确定性估计。然而，这些不确定性估计是基于模型假设正确的前提下进行的，而在大多数实际应用中，所需的知识很少可用，这导致产生的不确定性估计可能非常误导人，例如对于95％置信水平产生的预测区间可能只覆盖了少于95％的真实标签。为了解决这个问题，本文介绍了一种基于机器学习框架Conformal Prediction（CP）的GPR扩展。这种扩展可以在模型完全错误的情况下保证生成具有所需覆盖度的预测区间。所提出的方法结合了GPR的优势和CP的有效覆盖保证，实验结果验证了其有效性。",
