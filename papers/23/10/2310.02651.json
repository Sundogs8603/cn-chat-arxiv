To address these challenges, we propose the Gradual Participant Selection scheme for Auction-based Federated Learning (GPS-AFL).

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习的成功依赖于数据所有者（DOs）的数量和质量，以及他们参与联邦学习模型训练的动机。已经提出了以声誉为基础的联邦学习参与者选择方法。然而，它们仍然面临冷启动问题和对高声誉DOs的潜在选择偏差的挑战。这种偏差可能导致较低声誉的DOs被过早地排除在未来的联邦学习训练轮次中，从而降低了训练数据的多样性和结果模型的泛化能力。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了基于拍卖的联邦学习渐进式参与者选择方案（GPS-AFL）。与现有的联邦学习激励机制不同，后者通常认为用于联邦学习任务的所有DOs必须一次性选择，GPS-AFL在多轮训练中逐渐选择所需的DOs，随着通过重复交互逐渐揭示更多信息。它的设计旨在在成本和效用之间取得平衡。",
