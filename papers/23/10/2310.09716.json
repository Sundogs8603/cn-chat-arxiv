    "translated_abstract": "查询重写在提升对话式搜索中起着重要作用，通过将上下文相关的用户查询转化为独立形式。现有方法主要利用人工重写的查询作为标签来训练查询重写模型。然而，人工重写可能缺乏足够的信息以实现最佳的检索性能。为了克服这个限制，我们提出利用大型语言模型(LLMs)作为查询重写器，通过精心设计的指令生成信息丰富的查询重写。我们定义了四个重要特性来定义规范的重写，并将其全部纳入指令中。此外，当初始查询重写可用时，我们引入了LLMs的重写编辑器的角色，形成一个“重写-编辑”过程。此外，我们提出将LLMs的重写能力提炼成较小的模型，以减少重写延迟。我们在QReCC数据集上进行的实验评估表明，信息丰富的查询重写可以提高搜索的效果。",
