    "abstract": "arXiv:2310.05670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Inspired by the necessity of morphological adaptation in animals, a growing body of work has attempted to expand robot training to encompass physical aspects of a robot's design. However, reinforcement learning methods capable of optimizing the 3D morphology of a robot have been restricted to reorienting or resizing the limbs of a predetermined and static topological genus. Here we show policy gradients for designing freeform robots with arbitrary external and internal structure. This is achieved through actions that deposit or remove bundles of atomic building blocks to form higher-level nonparametric macrostructures such as appendages, organs and cavities. Although results are provided for open loop control only, we discuss how this method could be adapted for closed loop control and sim2real transfer to physical machines in future.",

    "translated_abstract": "受到动物形态适应性的启发，越来越多的研究致力于扩展机器人训练，涵盖机器人设计的物理方面。然而，能够优化机器人3D形态的强化学习方法一直局限于重新定位或调整预定和静态拓扑属的肢体。在这里，我们展示了用于设计具有任意外部和内部结构的自由形态机器人的策略梯度。通过放置或移除原子建筑块束来形成高级非参数宏结构，如附肢、器官和腔室。尽管仅提供了开环控制的结果，但我们讨论了这种方法如何在未来适用于闭环控制和从模拟到现实机器人的转移。",
