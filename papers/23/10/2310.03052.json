While one solution is to increase input length, endlessly stretching the length is unrealistic. Furthermore, humans selectively remember and use only relevant information from inputs, unlike Transformers which process all raw data from start to end. We introduce Memoria, a general memory network that applies Hebbian theory which is a major theory explaining human memory formulation to enhance long-term dependencies in neural networks. Memoria stores and retrieves information called engram at multiple memory levels of working memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory, using connection weights that change according to Hebb's rule. Through experiments with popular Transformer-based models like BERT and GPT, we present that Memoria significantly improves the ability to consider long-term dependencies in various tasks. Resul",

    "translated_abstract": "Transformer 在多个领域和任务中取得了成功。然而，由于其有限的容量，Transformer 很难处理长输入序列。虽然增加输入长度是一个解决方案，但无止境地增加长度是不现实的。此外，与 Transformer 不同，人类有选择性地记住和使用仅与输入相关的信息，而不是从头到尾处理所有原始数据。我们引入了 Memoria，一个应用海比安记忆形成理论的通用记忆网络，用于增强神经网络中的长期依赖。Memoria 在工作记忆、短期记忆和长期记忆的多个记忆层级上存储和检索称为 engram 的信息，使用根据海布规则变化的连接权重。通过与诸如 BERT 和 GPT 等流行的基于 Transformer 的模型进行实验，我们提出 Memoria 显著提高了在各种任务中考虑长期依赖的能力。结果",
