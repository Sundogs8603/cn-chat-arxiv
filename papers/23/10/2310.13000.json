    "translated_abstract": "文档级关系抽取是一项致力于识别文档内实体间关系的任务。然而，现有的文档级关系抽取模型往往忽视了关系之间的相关性，并缺乏对关系相关性的定量分析。为了解决这一问题并有效捕捉文档级关系抽取中的关系相关性，我们提出了一种关系图方法，旨在明确利用关系之间的相互依赖关系。首先，我们构建一个关系图，利用先前的关系知识导出的统计共现信息来建模关系之间的相关性。其次，我们采用重新加权的方法创建一个有效的关系相关性矩阵，以引导关系信息的传播。此外，我们利用图注意力网络来聚合关系嵌入。重要的是，我们的方法可以无缝地作为一个即插即用的模块集成到现有的模型中。实验结果表明，我们的方法可以增强关系抽取的效果。",
