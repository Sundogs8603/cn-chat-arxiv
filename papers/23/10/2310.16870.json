    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications have greatly enhanced the perception capabilities of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) by enabling information sharing to \"see through the occlusions\", resulting in significant performance improvements. However, developing and training complex multi-agent perception models from scratch can be expensive and unnecessary when existing single-agent models show remarkable generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a new framework termed MACP, which equips a single-agent pre-trained model with cooperation capabilities. We approach this objective by identifying the key challenges of shifting from single-agent to cooperative settings, adapting the model by freezing most of its parameters and adding a few lightweight modules. We demonstrate in our experiments that the proposed framework can effectively utilize cooperative observations and outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in both simulated and real-world cooperative perception",

    "translated_abstract": "车辆间的通信极大地增强了连接和自动驾驶车辆的感知能力，通过实现信息共享以\"穿透\"遮挡物，从而显著提高性能。然而，从头开始开发和训练复杂的多智能体感知模型可能昂贵且不必要，因为现有的单智能体模型展现出了令人瞩目的泛化能力。在本文中，我们提出了一个名为MACP的新框架，将单个预训练模型配备了合作能力。我们通过确定从单智能体到合作环境的关键挑战，通过冻结大部分参数并添加几个轻量级模块来使模型适应。我们在实验中证明，所提出的框架可以有效利用合作观测，并在模拟和真实环境中胜过其他最先进的方法。",
