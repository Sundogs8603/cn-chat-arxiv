    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言处理领域，开放领域的聊天机器人已经成为一个重要的研究课题。然而，现有开放领域聊天机器人研究的主要限制是其对短期单次对话的单一关注，忽视了在进行中的对话之前多个连续的会话中理解上下文信息的潜在需求。在多场对话环境中组成上下文的元素中，会话之间的时间间隔和发言者之间的关系尤为重要。尽管它们的重要性，目前的研究工作并没有充分解决这些对话组成部分。在本文中，我们介绍了一个新的1M多场对话数据集，称为Conversation Chronicles，用于实现长期对话设置，并包含了时间间隔和细粒度的发言者关系。我们利用了大型语言模型来生成数据，追随最近的研究工作。",
