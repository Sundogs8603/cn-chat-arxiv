    "abstract": "The application of transfer learning, an approach utilizing knowledge from a source domain to enhance model performance in a target domain, has seen a tremendous rise in recent years, underpinning many real-world scenarios. The key to its success lies in the shared common knowledge between the domains, a prerequisite in most transfer learning methodologies. These methods typically presuppose identical feature spaces and label spaces in both domains, known as homogeneous transfer learning, which, however, is not always a practical assumption. Oftentimes, the source and target domains vary in feature spaces, data distributions, and label spaces, making it challenging or costly to secure source domain data with identical feature and label spaces as the target domain. Arbitrary elimination of these differences is not always feasible or optimal. Thus, heterogeneous transfer learning, acknowledging and dealing with such disparities, has emerged as a promising approach for a variety of tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，迁移学习的应用在很多实际场景中得到了广泛的应用，它利用源领域的知识来增强目标领域模型的性能。其成功的关键在于源领域和目标领域之间的共享知识，这是大多数迁移学习方法的前提条件。然而，这些方法通常假设两个领域具有相同的特征空间和标签空间，即同质迁移学习，但这并不总是现实合理的假设。通常，源领域和目标领域在特征空间、数据分布和标签空间上存在差异，这使得获取具有与目标领域相同特征和标签空间的源领域数据变得具有挑战性或昂贵。对这些差异进行随意的消除并不总是可行或最优的。因此，异构迁移学习作为一种应对这种差异的方法已经崭露头角，并在各种任务中显示出了巨大的潜力。",
