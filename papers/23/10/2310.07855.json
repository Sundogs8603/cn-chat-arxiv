    "translated_abstract": "在利用最近邻检索进行自监督表示学习时，以对象为中心的图像已被证明是有益的。然而，当应用于以场景为中心的数据集时，这种方法面临限制，在图像中的多个对象仅在全局表示中被隐含地捕获。这种全局引导可能导致对象表示的不可取的纠缠。此外，即使是以对象为中心的数据集，也可以受益于更细粒度的引导方法。为了应对这些挑战，我们引入了一种新的适用于增强密集视觉表示学习的跨图像对象级引导方法。通过在整个训练过程中采用对象级最近邻引导，CrIBo成为一个明显强大和适当的候选方案，用于上下文学习，在测试时利用最近邻检索。CrIBo在后一个任务上显示出最先进的性能，同时在更标准的下游自然理解应用中具有很高的竞争力。",
