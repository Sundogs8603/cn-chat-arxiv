    "translated_abstract": "先前的研究已经确定了将AI伦理主题纳入计算机与数据科学课程的重要性。我们提供了证据表明，AI伦理教育的关键目标之一必须是提高对AI伤害的意识。虽然有各种来源可以了解此类伤害，但AI事故数据库（AIID）是为数不多的试图提供一个相对全面的数据库，索引以前在真实世界中部署AI技术导致的伤害或潜在伤害的实例之一。本研究评估了AIID作为一种教育工具，在有社会高风险领域中提高对AI伤害的普遍性和严重性的意识的有效性。我们通过在一所R1机构的课程中进行的一项课堂研究来呈现所得到的研究结果，该课程专注于AI和ML的社会和伦理考虑。我们的定性研究结果描绘了学生对AI伦理核心主题的初步看法以及他们希望填补知识缺口的愿望。",
