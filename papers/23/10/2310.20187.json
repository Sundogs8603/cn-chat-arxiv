In this work, we propose a deep learning-based precipitation post-processor approach to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The precipitation post-processor consists of (i) self-supervised pre-training, where parameters of encoder are pre-trained on the reconstruction of masked variables of the atmospheric physics domain, and (ii) transfer learning on precipitation segmentation tasks (target domain) from the pre-trained encoder.

    "translated_abstract": "为了预防危险天气事件，确保充足的局地降水预报提前时间至关重要。然而，全球变暖引起的气候变化增加了准确预测严重降水事件（如暴雨）的挑战。本工作提出了一种基于深度学习的降水后处理方法，用于数值天气预报（NWP）模型。降水后处理包括（i）自监督预训练，其中编码器的参数在大气物理领域的遮蔽变量重构上进行预训练，以及（ii）从预训练的编码器中转移学习到降水分割任务（目标领域）。我们还引入了一种启发式标记方法，以有效地训练类别不平衡的数据集。我们在区域NWP中的降水校正实验结果表明，所提出的方法优于其他方法。",
