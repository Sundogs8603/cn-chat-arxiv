    "abstract": "The quest to comprehend the origins of intelligence raises intriguing questions about the evolution of learning abilities in natural systems. Why do living organisms possess an inherent drive to acquire knowledge of the unknown? Is this motivation solely explicable through natural selection, favoring systems capable of learning due to their increased chances of survival? Or do there exist additional, more rapid mechanisms that offer immediate rewards to systems entering the \"learning mode\" in the \"right ways\"? This article explores the latter possibility and endeavors to unravel the possible nature of these ways. We propose that learning may have non-biological and non-evolutionary origin. It turns out that key properties of learning can be observed, explained, and accurately reproduced within simple physical models that describe energy accumulation mechanisms in open resonant-type systems with dissipation.",

    "translated_abstract": "理解智能的起源的探索引发了有关自然系统中学习能力的进化的有趣问题。为什么生物体具有获取未知知识的固有动力？这种动力是否仅通过自然选择来解释，因为能够学习的系统由于增加了生存机会而受到青睐？还是存在其他更快速的机制，以“正确的方式”即刻奖励进入“学习模式”的系统？本文探讨了后一种可能性，并努力揭示这些方式的可能性质。我们提出学习可能具有非生物和非进化起源。事实证明，可以在简单的物理模型中观察、解释和准确重现描述开放谐振型系统中能量积累机制的关键特性。",
