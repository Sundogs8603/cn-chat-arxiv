    "translated_abstract": "尽管强化学习在机器人应用中取得了一些进展，但由于昂贵的交互成本，许多任务仍然难以解决。迁移学习通过将在源领域学到的知识转移到目标领域，有助于减少目标领域的训练时间。Sim2Real迁移有助于将在模拟机器人领域学到的知识转移到物理目标领域。知识迁移减少了在交互成本高的物理世界中训练任务所需的时间。然而，大多数现有方法假设两个领域的任务结构和物理属性完全对应。本文提出了一个通过观察映射和行为克隆进行少样本策略转移的框架。我们使用生成对抗网络（GANs）和循环一致性损失来映射源领域和目标领域之间的观察，并且后续使用这个学到的映射来克隆源任务的成功策略。",
