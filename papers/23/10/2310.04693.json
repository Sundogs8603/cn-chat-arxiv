    "translated_abstract": "提升建模在在线营销中展示了非常有希望的结果。然而，大多数现有的工作在一些实际应用中容易受到鲁棒性挑战的影响。本文首先对上述现象给出了一个可能的解释。我们使用不同的真实世界数据集验证了在线营销中存在特征敏感性问题，一些关键特征的扰动会严重影响提升模型的性能，甚至导致相反的趋势。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了一种新颖的通过对抗特征抑制增强鲁棒性的提升建模框架（RUAD）。具体来说，我们的RUAD通过两个定制模块更有效地减轻提升模型的特征敏感性，包括一个具有联合多标签建模的特征选择模块，以从输入特征中识别一个关键子集，以及一个采用对抗训练和软插值操作的对抗特征抑制模块。",
