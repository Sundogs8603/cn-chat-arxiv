    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs），如ChatGPT/GPT-4，因其广泛的实际应用而受到广泛关注，但其在网络平台上存在事实冲突幻觉的问题限制了其采用。对由LLMs产生的文本的事实性评估仍然未被充分探索，不仅涉及对基本事实的判断，还包括对复杂推理任务（如多跳等）中出现的事实错误的评估。为此，我们引入了FactCHD，一种为LLMs精心设计的事实冲突幻觉检测基准。作为在“查询-响应”上下文中评估事实性的关键工具，我们的基准采用了大规模数据集，涵盖了广泛的事实模式，如基本事实，多跳，比较和集合操作模式。我们基准的一个独特特点是其包含基于事实的证据链，从而便于进行组合性幻觉的检测。",
