    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the concept of \"alignment\" in large language models (LLMs) through the lens of post-structuralist socio-political theory, specifically examining its parallels to empty signifiers. To establish a shared vocabulary around how abstract concepts of alignment are operationalised in empirical datasets, we propose a framework that demarcates: 1) which dimensions of model behaviour are considered important, then 2) how meanings and definitions are ascribed to these dimensions, and by whom. We situate existing empirical literature and provide guidance on deciding which paradigm to follow. Through this framework, we aim to foster a culture of transparency and critical evaluation, aiding the community in navigating the complexities of aligning LLMs with human populations.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过后结构主义社会政治理论的视角，探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)中的“对齐”概念，并特别研究了其与空符号的相似之处。为了在经验数据集中明确操作化抽象对齐概念的共享词汇，我们提出了一个框架，界定了：1）哪些模型行为维度被认为重要，然后2）如何赋予这些维度的含义和定义，并由谁确定。我们对现有的经验文献进行了定位，并提供了在决定要遵循哪种范式方面的指导。通过这个框架，我们旨在培养透明和批判性评估的文化，帮助社区在处理将LLMs与人类群体对齐的复杂性时进行导航。",
