    "translated_abstract": "射频指纹识别（RFF）技术承诺基于制造过程中引入的固有硬件缺陷来在物理层对无线设备进行身份验证。这些射频发射器的缺陷反映在空中信号中，使接收器能够准确识别射频发射源。近年来，机器学习，特别是深度学习（DL）的进步，提高了RFF系统提取和学习构成设备特定指纹的复杂特征的能力。然而，将DL技术与RFF集成并在实际场景中运行系统面临许多挑战。本文在考虑DL-based RFF系统的三个参考阶段（数据收集和预处理，训练，最后部署）的基础上，识别和分析了这些挑战。我们的调查指出了目前阻碍RFF实际部署的现有问题，并讨论了有前途的未来发展方向。",
