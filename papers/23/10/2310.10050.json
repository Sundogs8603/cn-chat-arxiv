    "translated_abstract": "数十亿个公共领域文件仍然被困在纸质副本中，或者缺乏准确的数字化。现代自然语言处理方法不能用于索引、检索和总结这些文本，进行计算文本分析，或提取信息进行统计分析，这些文本也不能融入语言模型训练。鉴于公共领域文本的多样性和庞大数量，以规模解放它们需要准确、非常廉价且能够自定义到新的收藏、语言和字符集的光学字符识别（OCR）。现有的OCR引擎，大多设计用于高资源语言的小规模商业应用，往往无法满足这些要求。EffOCR（智能OCR）是一种新颖的开源OCR方法，通过放弃通常用于OCR的序列到序列架构，满足了在大规模解放文本方面的计算和样本效率要求。",
