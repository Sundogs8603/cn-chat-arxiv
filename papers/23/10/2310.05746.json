    "translated_abstract": "最近大型语言模型（LLM）的发展展示了先进的推理能力，然而自然语言处理的评估通常依赖于静态基准。评估这一点需要测试战略推理能力的环境，这种环境需要在动态的竞争场景中进行长期规划。我们引入了AucArena，这是一个模拟拍卖的新颖评估套件，选择这个设置是因为它非常不可预测，涉及与资源和风险管理相关的许多技能，同时也易于评估。我们进行了使用最先进的LLM驱动竞标代理的受控实验，以评估他们的规划和执行技能。我们的研究表明，诸如GPT-4之类的LLM具有拍卖参与的关键技能，如预算管理和目标遵从，这些技能会随着自适应策略的改进而提高。这突出了LLM在建模竞技背景下的复杂社会互动潜力。",
