    "translated_abstract": "差分敏感性测度为解释从仿真到算法预测等各种应用中使用的复杂计算模型提供了有价值的工具。对模型输出在模型参数方向上的导数可以揭示输入-输出关系以及模型参数和输入变量的相对重要性。然而，当模型函数具有不连续性和/或输入变量是离散的时，如何进行这样的导数计算尚不清楚。我们提出了一个通用的框架来解决这些问题，考虑到与通过阶跃函数影响模型输出的随机输入变量（风险因子）相关的失真的量化输出风险测度的导数。我们证明，在满足弱技术条件的情况下，这些导数是有定义的，并推导出相应的公式。我们将我们的结果应用于复合风险模型的敏感性分析，并对再保险信用风险进行了数值研究。",
