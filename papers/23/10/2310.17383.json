In this paper we ask the question about possibility of cognitive activity recognition on the base of particular set of signals. We use recognition of the game played by the participant as a playground for exploration of the problem. We build classifier of three different games (Space Invaders, Tetris, Tower Defence) and inter-game pause. We validate classifier in the player-independent and player-dependent scenario. We discuss the improvement in the player-dependent scenario in the context of biometric person recognition. On the base of the results obtained in game classification, we consider potential applications in smart surveillance and quantified self.",

    "translated_abstract": "通过自动解读信号，在情感计算和人类活动识别领域得到了许多应用。本文探讨了在特定信号集合的基础上是否可以识别认知活动的可能性。我们以参与者所玩游戏的识别作为问题探索的实验场所。我们构建了三种不同游戏（太空侵略者、俄罗斯方块、塔防）和游戏间暂停的分类器。我们在独立于玩家和依赖于玩家两种情况下验证了分类器。我们讨论了在依赖于玩家情景中的改进，以及在生物特征人员识别方面的改进。根据游戏分类结果，我们考虑了在智能监控和量化自身方面的潜在应用。",
