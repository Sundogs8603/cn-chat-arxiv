    "translated_abstract": "网络入侵检测系统（NIDS）是保护计算机网络免受各种网络安全威胁和网络攻击的关键组件。然而，考虑到一种不幸的情况，即NIDS本身受到攻击并易受攻击，我们可以说，如何保卫捍卫者？在对抗机器学习（AML）中，恶意行为者旨在通过特意制作的对抗性样本来欺骗机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）模型，产生不正确的预测。这些对抗性样本已成为ML和DL系统的最大漏洞，并且是在实时和关键任务应用（例如NIDS）中采用它们的主要障碍。AML是一个新兴的研究领域，对对抗性攻击及其防御策略的深入研究已成为保护计算机网络免受各种网络安全威胁的必要性。在这项研究工作中，我们的目标是涵盖与NI相关的重要方面。",
