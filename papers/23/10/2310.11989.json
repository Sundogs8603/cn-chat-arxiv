    "translated_abstract": "聚类的核心是融入先前的知识来构建监督信号。从基于数据紧密性的经典k均值到最近的基于自监督引导的对比聚类，聚类方法的进步与监督信号的发展内在地相对应。目前，很多工作已经致力于从数据中挖掘内部监督信号。然而，丰富的外部知识，例如语义描述，自然地促进了聚类，却被遗憾地忽视了。在这项工作中，我们提出利用外部知识作为新的监督信号来引导聚类，即使它似乎与给定的数据无关。为了实现和验证我们的想法，我们设计了一种外部引导的聚类方法（文本辅助聚类，TAC），它利用WordNet的文本语义来促进图像聚类。具体而言，TAC首先选择并检索最能区分图像的WordNet名词以增强聚类的效果。",
