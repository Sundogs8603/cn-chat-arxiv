    "translated_abstract": "由于软式执行器的非线性动力学和高维输入空间，柔性机器人的步态生成存在一定的挑战。软式机器人控制和感知的限制迫使研究人员手工设计开环控制器来生成步态序列，这是一个非平凡的过程。此外，软式执行器的寿命短和执行器行为的自然变化限制了机器学习技术在与机器人部署时间相同的时间尺度上的应用。最后，由于柔性机器人材料的异质性和非线性，模拟并不总是可行的，而且材料的动力学因磨损而发生变化。我们提出了一种高效且无需仿真的自动生成软式机器人步态的方法，使用非常少的计算。该技术在一个由16个“交错剪切的奇异加倍”（HSA）执行器构成的四足电动软式机器人上得到了演示。",
