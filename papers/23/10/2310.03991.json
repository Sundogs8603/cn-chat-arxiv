    "translated_abstract": "现有的水印算法由于其基于令牌级别的设计，对释义攻击具有弱点。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于局部敏感哈希（LSH）的稳健句级语义水印算法——SemStamp，该算法对句子的语义空间进行划分。算法对由LLM生成的候选句子进行编码和LSH哈希，并在语义嵌入空间中执行句级拒绝采样，直到采样的句子落入水印分区中。采用基于边界的约束来增强其稳健性。为了展示我们算法的优势，我们提出了一种名为\"bigram\"的释义攻击，使用与原始句子最少的bigram重叠的释义。实验结果表明，我们的新颖语义水印算法不仅在常见的释义和bigram上比之前的最先进方法更稳健。",
