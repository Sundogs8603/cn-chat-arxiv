    "translated_abstract": "概率分层时间序列预测是时间序列预测的重要变体，其目标是对具有层次化关系的多变量时间序列进行建模和预测。大多数方法关注点预测，并未提供经过良好校准的概率预测分布。最近的概率预测方法也在点预测和分布样本中施加层次关系，但未考虑预测分布的相关性。以往的研究也默认数据集总是与给定的层次关系保持一致，并未适应显示出偏离此假设的真实世界数据集。我们填补了这两个空白，并提出了PROFHiT模型，它是一个完全概率的分层预测模型，同时对整个层次的预测分布进行建模。PROFHiT使用灵活的概率贝叶斯方法，并引入了一种新颖的分布一致性正则化方法。",
    "tldr": "提出了一个新的概率分层时间序列预测模型，该模型能够有效建模和预测具有层次化关系的多变量时间序列。相较于现有方法，该模型不仅考虑点预测，还能提供经过良好校准的概率预测分布，并且在建模过程中考虑了预测分布的相关性。",
    "en_tdlr": "A new probabilistic hierarchical time series forecasting model is proposed, which can effectively model and forecast multivariate time series with hierarchical relations. Compared to existing methods, this model not only considers point predictions but also provides well-calibrated probabilistic forecast distributions, while also considering the coherency of forecast distributions."
