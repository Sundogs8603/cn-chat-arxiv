    "translated_abstract": "在充满活力的自然语言处理领域，神经主题模型（NTMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）已成为重要的研究领域。尽管如此，NTMs主要使用来自LLMs的上下文嵌入，这对于聚类或主题生成来说并不是最佳选择。我们的研究通过引入名为DeTiME的新框架来解决这一问题。DeTiME利用编码-解码的LLMs产生高度可聚类的嵌入，与现有方法相比，能够生成既具有优越的聚类性又具有增强的语义一致性的主题。此外，通过利用扩散的能力，我们的框架还提供了生成与已识别主题相关内容的能力。这种双重功能使用户能够同时高效产生高度聚类的主题和相关内容。DeTiME的潜力还包括生成集群化的嵌入。",
