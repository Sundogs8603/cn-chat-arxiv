To deal with such situations, we propose a novel time-series trend-following forecaster that is able to quickly adapt to new market conditions, referred to as regimes. We leverage recent developments from the deep learning community and use few-shot learning. We propose the Cross Attentive Time-Series Trend Network - X-Trend which takes positions attending over a context set of financial time-series regimes. X-Trend transfers trends from similar patterns in the context set to make predictions and take positions for a new distinct target regime. X-Trend is able to quickly adapt to new financial regimes with a Sharpe ratio increase of 18.9% over a neural forecaster and 10-fold over a conventional Time-series ",

    "translated_abstract": "针对系统化交易策略的预测模型在金融市场条件发生变化时无法迅速适应的问题，我们提出了一种新颖的时间序列趋势跟踪预测器，能够快速适应新的市场条件。我们利用深度学习领域的最新进展，采用少样本学习的方法。我们提出了交叉注意力时间序列趋势网络 - X-Trend，通过对金融时间序列进行关注，从上下文样本集中转移相似模式的趋势，对新的目标情境进行预测和定位。X-Trend能够快速适应新的金融情境，其夏普比率相对于神经预测器提高了18.9%，相对于传统时间序列方法提高了10倍。",
