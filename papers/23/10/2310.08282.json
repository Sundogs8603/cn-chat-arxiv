    "translated_abstract": "多尺度建模复杂系统对于理解其复杂性至关重要。数据驱动多尺度建模已成为解决复杂系统挑战的一种有希望的方法。另一方面，自相似性在复杂系统中普遍存在，这表明大规模复杂系统可以以较低成本进行建模。本文引入了一个多尺度神经网络框架，将自相似性作为先验知识，并实现了对自相似动力系统的建模。对于确定性动力学，我们的框架可以判断动力学是否自相似。对于不确定性动力学，它可以比较和确定哪个参数集更接近自相似性。该框架允许我们从动力学中提取与尺度无关的核进行任意尺度的建模。此外，我们的方法可以识别自相似系统中的幂律指数。对Ising模型的初步测试产生了与理论一致的临界指数。",
