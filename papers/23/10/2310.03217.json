    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，机器学习在与自主飞行相关的感知任务中表现出令人印象深刻的结果，往往超过了人类的能力。与传统的航空航天软件不同，机器学习模型的参数不是手工编码或从物理学派生的，而是从数据中学习的。它们在训练阶段自动调整，其值通常不符合物理要求。因此，要求不能直接追溯到代码行，阻碍了当前自下而上的航空航天认证范式。本文试图通过以下方式填补这一差距：1）揭示构建机器学习模型的内部工作原理和过程，2）正式建立这些过程所提供的理论保证，3）补充这些形式要素与实际考虑，以开发一种完整的安全关键机器学习系统认证论证。基于可扩展的统计验证器，我们提出了一个框架",
