    "translated_abstract": "当放置在任意场景位置时，对抗性贴片破坏了光流预测的可靠性。因此，它们对现实世界中的运动检测及其下游应用构成了真实威胁。潜在的解决方案是检测和去除对抗性贴片的防御策略，但其对底层运动预测的影响尚未被研究。在本文中，我们对当前可用的检测和去除防御策略ILP和LGS对一系列先进光流方法进行了彻底的研究，并阐明了它们对最终光流预测的质量和鲁棒性的副作用。特别地，我们实施了防御感知攻击，以调查当前的防御是否能够抵御考虑防御机制的攻击。我们的实验得出了两个令人惊讶的结果：检测和去除防御策略不仅降低了良好场景下的光流质量，同时也损害了针对贴片攻击的鲁棒性。",
