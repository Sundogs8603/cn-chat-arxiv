The proposed new model is also benchmarked over this same period against a hidden Markov model, the most popular current model for financial regime prediction, and against an appropriate index benchmark for each asset class, in the case of the commodities model having a test period cost-adjusted cumulative return over four times higher than that expected from the index.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究在之前研究的体制检测基础上进行扩展，将体制的预测引入到交易预测中，从而在考虑的三个资产类别（股票、商品和外汇）上实现了大幅度的绩效改进，在四年的测试期间。所提出的新模型还与当前最流行的金融体制预测模型——隐马尔可夫模型以及每个资产类别的适当指数基准进行了对比。需要注意的是，所提出的模型采用了金融行业中常见但在机器学习模型中相对较少探索的“逆向交易”策略。该模型还采用了频繁的空头头寸，这在某些情况下并不总是理想的。",
