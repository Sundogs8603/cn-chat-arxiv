    "abstract": "Due to limited resources and fast economic growth, designing optimal transportation road networks with traffic simulation and validation in a cost-effective manner is vital for developing countries, where extensive manual testing is expensive and often infeasible. Current rule-based road design generators lack diversity, a key feature for design robustness. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) learn stochastic policies to sample from an unnormalized reward distribution, thus generating high-quality solutions while preserving their diversity. In this work, we formulate the problem of linking incident roads to the circular junction of a roundabout by a Markov decision process, and we leverage GFlowNets as the Junction-Art road generator. We compare our method with related methods and our empirical results show that our method achieves better diversity while preserving a high validity score.",

    "translated_abstract": "鉴于有限的资源和快速的经济增长，以一种有效的成本方式设计优化的交通道路网络，并进行交通仿真和验证对于发展中国家至关重要，而广泛的手动测试昂贵且常常无法实现。当前基于规则的道路设计生成器缺乏多样性，这是设计鲁棒性的关键特征。生成性流网络（GFlowNets）学习从一个未归一化的奖励分布中进行采样的随机策略，从而在保持多样性的同时生成高质量的解决方案。在这项工作中，我们将将事件道路与环形道路的连接问题建模为马尔科夫决策过程，并利用GFlowNets作为Junction-Art道路生成器。我们将我们的方法与相关方法进行了比较，实证结果表明我们的方法在保持高有效性得分的同时实现了更好的多样性。",
