    "translated_abstract": "对生产系统的实证软件工程研究为从业者和研究人员带来了对软件工程过程的更好理解。然而，只有生产系统的一小部分进行了研究，限制了该研究的影响力。虽然软件工程从业者可以通过复制研究来获得充实自己数据的好处，但这也带来了一系列挑战，因为执行复制需要对研究方法和软件工程数据中的微妙细节有深入的理解。鉴于大型语言模型（LLMs）如GPT-4在处理软件工程和科学任务方面显示出潜力，这些模型可以帮助推广实证软件工程研究。在这篇论文中，我们研究了LLMs在新数据上执行实证软件工程研究复制的能力。我们特别研究了它们揭示实证软件工程研究方法中所做的假设的能力。",
