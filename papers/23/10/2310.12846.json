    "translated_abstract": "已知微分代数方程(DAEs)能够描述动态变化和基础约束，已经广泛应用于流体力学、多体动力学、机械系统和控制理论等工程领域。在这些领域的实际物理建模中，系统通常会产生高阶DAEs。传统的隐式数值方法在求解高阶系统时通常会导致数值精度下降。最近，物理信息神经网络(PINN)在解决DAE系统方面引起了关注。然而，它面临着如不能直接求解高阶系统、预测精度较低和泛化能力较弱等挑战。本文提出了一个将Radau IIA数值方法与注意力机制相结合的神经网络结构的PINN计算框架，以直接求解高阶DAEs。此外，我们还采用了领域分解策略以增强其求解能力。",
