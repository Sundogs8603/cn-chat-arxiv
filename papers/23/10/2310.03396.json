    "translated_abstract": "步态分析利用独特的行走模式进行人物识别和多领域评估。在步态分析方法中，基于骨架的方法因其稳健且可解释的特征而显示出潜力。然而，这些方法通常依赖于基于人体解剖学的手工制作的时空图，忽略了数据集和任务的特殊性。本文提出了一种新的方法，用于简化步态基于性别估计的时空图表示，提高解释性而不损失性能。我们的方法使用了上游模型和下游模型，可以调整每个行走实例的邻接矩阵，从而消除了图的固定性。通过采用直通Gumbel-Softmax技巧，我们的模型可以端对端地进行训练。我们在CASIA-B数据集上验证了我们方法的有效性，得到的图形具有良好的可解释性和性能。",
