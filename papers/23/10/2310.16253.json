    "translated_abstract": "随着对于大型语言模型（LLMs）在故障定位和程序修复中的兴趣增加，确保LLM方法的完整性和普适性变得非常重要。现有广泛采用的这些任务的基准代码是在LLMs的兴起之前编写的，可能包含在现有流行的LLMs的训练数据中，从而面临数据泄漏的威胁，导致误导性乐观的性能指标。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了“ConDefects”这个新颖的数据集，精心策划以消除这种重叠。ConDefects包含1,254个Java有错误的程序和1,625个Python有错误的程序。所有这些程序都来自线上竞赛平台AtCoder，并在2021年10月至2023年9月之间产生。我们将每个错误与错误位置和相应的修复代码版本配对，使其适用于故障定位和程序修复相关的研究。我们还提供...",
