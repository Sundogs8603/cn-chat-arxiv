    "abstract": "We show that fluctuations in the ratio of non-core to core funding in the banking systems of advanced economies are driven by a handful of global factors of both real and financial natures, with country-specific factors playing no significant roles. Exchange rate flexibility helps insulate the non-core to core ratio from such global factors but only significantly so outside periods of major global financial disruptions, as in 2008-2009.",
