    "translated_abstract": "基于体素的多重检验在神经影像数据分析中广泛应用。传统的虚警控制方法常常忽视基于体素的检验之间的空间相关性，从而导致测试能力的大幅损失。虽然最近出现了一些空间虚警控制方法，但是当处理复杂的脑空间依赖关系时，它们的有效性和最优性仍存在疑问。与此同时，深度学习方法已经在图像分割方面取得了革命性的进展，而图像分割与基于体素的多重检验密切相关。本文提出了一种名为DeepFDR的新型空间虚警控制方法，利用无监督的基于深度学习的图像分割来解决基于体素的多重检验问题。包括全面的模拟和阿尔茨海默病FDG-PET影像分析在内的数值研究表明DeepFDR相对于现有方法具有优势。DeepFDR不仅在虚警控制方面表现出色，还有效降低了虚假的非发现率。",
