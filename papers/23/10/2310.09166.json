    "abstract": "Media bias has been extensively studied by both social and computational sciences. However, current work still has a large reliance on human input and subjective assessment to label biases. This is especially true for cable news research. To address these issues, we develop an unsupervised machine learning method to characterize the bias of cable news programs without any human input. This method relies on the analysis of what topics are mentioned through Named Entity Recognition and how those topics are discussed through Stance Analysis in order to cluster programs with similar biases together. Applying our method to 2020 cable news transcripts, we find that program clusters are consistent over time and roughly correspond to the cable news network of the program. This method reveals the potential for future tools to objectively assess media bias and characterize unfamiliar media environments.",

    "translated_abstract": "媒体偏见在社会科学和计算机科学领域得到了广泛研究。然而，目前的研究仍然在很大程度上依靠人工输入和主观评估来标记偏见，尤其是有线电视研究更是如此。为了解决这些问题，我们开发了一种无监督的机器学习方法，以在没有任何人工输入的情况下表征有线电视节目的偏见。该方法依赖于通过命名实体识别分析提及的主题以及通过立场分析来讨论这些主题的方式，以便将具有类似偏见的节目进行聚类。将我们的方法应用于2020年的有线电视转录中，我们发现节目聚类随时间保持一致，并大致对应于节目所属的有线电视网络。该方法揭示了未来客观评估媒体偏见和表征陌生媒体环境的潜力。",
