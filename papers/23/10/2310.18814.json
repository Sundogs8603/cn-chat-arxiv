    "translated_abstract": "我们在平方响应（$Y^2$）没有重尾的温和条件下，确立了随机森林的稳定性。特别地，我们的分析适用于在流行软件包（如R中的randomForest）中实现的实际版本的随机森林。实证结果表明，稳定性可能会超出我们的假设，并对重尾的$Y^2$有效。利用稳定性属性，我们证明了随机森林的out-of-bag误差构建的预测区间的覆盖概率的非渐近下界。在$Y$连续时通常满足的其他温和条件下，我们还建立了一个补充的上界，这个上界也可以类似地建立在任意稳定算法构建的jackknife预测区间上。我们还讨论了在比以前文献考虑的条件更弱的假设下的渐近覆盖概率。我们的工作表明，随机森林在稳定性和覆盖率方面是有效的。",
