    "translated_abstract": "奥塔哥锻炼计划(OEP)是一种用于改善年长者脆弱、肌少症和平衡的康复计划。准确地监测患者参与OEP的情况具有挑战性，因为自我报告(日记)通常不可靠。随着可穿戴传感器的发展，利用可穿戴传感器进行人体活动识别(HAR)的系统已经改变了医疗保健。然而，它们在OEP的使用仍然表现出有限的性能。本研究旨在构建一个不显眼且准确的系统，以监测年长者参与OEP的情况。数据是从佩戴单个腰部IMU的年长者身上收集的。收集了两组数据，一组是在实验室环境中，一组是在患者家中。提出了一个分层系统，分为两个阶段：1)使用深度学习模型，利用10分钟的滑动窗口识别患者是在进行OEP还是日常生活活动(ADLs)；2)基于第一阶段，使用6秒的滑动窗口重新识别OEP与ADLs。",
