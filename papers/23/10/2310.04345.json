    "translated_abstract": "鲁棒优化提供了一个数学框架，用于在最坏情况下的不确定性下建模和解决决策问题。本工作解决了二阶段鲁棒优化（也称为可调整鲁棒优化）问题，在不确定性实现之前和之后进行第一阶段和第二阶段的决策。这导致了一个嵌套的最小-最大-最小优化问题，从计算上来说是非常具有挑战性的，尤其是当决策是离散的时候。我们提出了Neur2RO，这是一种高效的基于机器学习的列-约束生成（CCG）的实例算法，CCG是二阶段鲁棒优化的经典迭代算法。具体而言，我们通过一种新颖的神经网络架构来学习估计第二阶段问题的值函数，这种架构易于优化。将我们的神经网络嵌入到CCG算法中，可以快速得到高质量的解，这在两个二阶段鲁棒优化基准测试（背包问题和资本预算）的实验证明了。",
