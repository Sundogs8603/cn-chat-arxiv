    "translated_abstract": "无线传感器网络由于其广泛的工业应用，被认为是21世纪最重要和创新的技术之一。由于其特殊的特性和部署方法，这些网络中的传感器节点容易受到各种攻击。在无线传感器网络中，拒绝服务攻击是常见的攻击方式。设计一个能够有效减少这些攻击对无线传感器网络影响的检测和预防系统是困难的。为了识别无线传感器网络中的攻击，本研究建议使用两种机器学习模型：决策树和XGBoost。对无线传感器网络数据集进行了大量的测试，以识别拒绝服务攻击。实验结果表明，将XGBoost模型应用于整个数据集时，真正例率（98.3%）高于决策树方法（97.3%），误报率（1.7%）低于决策树技术（2.7%）。",
