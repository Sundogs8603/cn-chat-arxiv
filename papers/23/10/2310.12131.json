    "abstract": "The escalating number of pending cases is a growing concern world-wide. Recent advancements in digitization have opened up possibilities for leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) tools in the processing of legal documents. Adopting a structured representation for legal documents, as opposed to a mere bag-of-words flat text representation, can significantly enhance processing capabilities. With the aim of achieving this objective, we put forward a set of diverse attributes for criminal case proceedings. We use a state-of-the-art sequence labeling framework to automatically extract attributes from the legal documents. Moreover, we demonstrate the efficacy of the extracted attributes in a downstream task, namely legal judgment prediction.",

    "translated_abstract": "挂起案件数量不断上升已成为全球关注的焦点。数字化的最新进展为利用人工智能工具处理法律文件提供了可能性。采用结构化表示法来处理法律文件，而不是仅使用平面文本表示，可以显著增强处理能力。为了实现这一目标，我们提出了一套用于刑事案件程序的多样属性。我们使用最先进的序列标记框架来自动从法律文件中提取属性。此外，我们还展示了从提取的属性在下游任务中（即法律判决预测）的有效性。",
