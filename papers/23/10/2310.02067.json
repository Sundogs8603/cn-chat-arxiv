    "abstract": "In the context of temporal image forensics, it is not evident that a neural network, trained on images from different time-slots (classes), exploit solely age related features. Usually, images taken in close temporal proximity (e.g., belonging to the same age class) share some common content properties. Such content bias can be exploited by a neural network. In this work, a novel approach that evaluates the influence of image content is proposed. This approach is verified using synthetic images (where content bias can be ruled out) with an age signal embedded. Based on the proposed approach, it is shown that a `standard' neural network trained in the context of age classification is strongly dependent on image content. As a potential countermeasure, two different techniques are applied to mitigate the influence of the image content during training, and they are also evaluated by the proposed method.",

    "translated_abstract": "在时间图像取证的背景下，很难确定一个神经网络训练仅仅利用与年龄相关的特征。通常，时间相近的图像（例如属于同一年龄类别的）具有一些共同的内容属性。这种内容偏差可以被神经网络利用。本文提出了一种评估图像内容影响的新方法。该方法使用带有嵌入式年龄信号的合成图像进行验证，通过该方法表明，在年龄分类的上下文中训练的“标准”神经网络在很大程度上依赖于图像内容。作为潜在的对策，本文应用了两种不同的技术来减轻训练过程中图像内容的影响，并且通过所提出的方法进行了评估。",
