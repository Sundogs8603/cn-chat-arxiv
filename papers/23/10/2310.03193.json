    "translated_abstract": "近年来，资助机构和期刊越来越倡导开放科学实践（例如数据和方法共享），以提高科学的透明度、可访问性和可重复性。然而，大规模量化这些实践的困难。在这项工作中，我们利用arXiv上114万篇论文的大规模数据集，代表了物理学、数学和计算机科学领域，分析了数据和方法共享实践的采用情况以及对文章接受度的影响。为了识别数据和方法的链接，我们训练了一个神经文本分类模型，根据论文中的上下文提及自动分类URL类型。我们发现，随着时间的推移，越来越多的论文包含此类链接，表明链接到方法和数据的共享实践正在扩散。特别是在计算机科学领域，可重复性的努力也在扩散，因为相同的链接越来越多地在论文中被重复使用。",
