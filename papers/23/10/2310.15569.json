    "abstract": "Keeping track of all relevant recent publications and experimental results for a research area is a challenging task. Prior work has demonstrated the efficacy of information extraction models in various scientific areas. Recently, several datasets have been released for the yet understudied materials science domain. However, these datasets focus on sub-problems such as parsing synthesis procedures or on sub-domains, e.g., solid oxide fuel cells. In this resource paper, we present MuLMS, a new dataset of 50 open-access articles, spanning seven sub-domains of materials science. The corpus has been annotated by domain experts with several layers ranging from named entities over relations to frame structures. We present competitive neural models for all tasks and demonstrate that multi-task training with existing related resources leads to benefits.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于一个研究领域，跟踪所有相关的最新出版物和实验结果是一项具有挑战性的任务。先前的工作已经证明了信息提取模型在各个科学领域的有效性。最近，已经发布了几个针对尚未研究的材料科学领域的数据集。然而，这些数据集侧重于解析合成程序等子问题或者侧重于子领域，例如固体氧化物燃料电池。在这篇资源论文中，我们介绍了MuLMS，一个包含50篇开放获取文章的新数据集，涵盖了材料科学的七个子领域。该语料库由领域专家进行了多个层次的注释，涵盖从命名实体到关系到框架结构的多个方面。我们提出了针对所有任务的竞争性神经模型，并证明利用现有的相关资源进行多任务训练是有益的。",
