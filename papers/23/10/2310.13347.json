    "translated_abstract": "将深度学习应用于护理操作活动理解可以极大地提高护士与患者互动的质量和安全性。通过利用这种技术，我们可以促进培训和教育，改善质量控制，并实现操作合规监控。然而，由于现有适当标记的数据集稀缺，该领域自动识别系统的发展受到了阻碍。现有的视频数据集存在几个限制：1）这些数据集在规模上较小，无法支持对护理活动的全面调查；2）它们主要关注单一操作，缺乏各种护理操作和操作步骤的专家级注释；3）它们缺乏时间上的本地化注释，这阻碍了对较长视频序列中目标动作的有效定位。为了缓解这些限制，我们提出了NurViD，一个具有专家级注释的大规模视频数据集，用于护理操作。",
