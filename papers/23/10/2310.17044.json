    "translated_abstract": "主动学习是一种有前途的范例，通过有策略地请求标签来提高模型性能，以减少标注成本。然而，现有的主动学习方法往往依赖于昂贵的收购函数计算、大量的建模重训练以及与标记者的多轮互动。为解决这些局限性，我们提出了一种新的主动学习方法，通过学习的替代模型选择批次未标记实例进行数据获取。这种方法的一个关键挑战是开发一个良好泛化的收购函数，因为随着时间推移，作为效用函数输入的历史数据不断增长。我们的算法贡献是一个双层多任务双层优化框架，预测不同训练集的相对效用，以验证准确性为度量，并确保学习的收购函数有效泛化。对于验证准确性昂贵的情况，我们还提供了一个处理策略。",
