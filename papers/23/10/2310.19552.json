    "abstract": "This paper presents novel characterization results for classes of law-invariant star-shaped functionals. We begin by establishing characterizations for positively homogeneous and star-shaped functionals that exhibit second- or convex-order stochastic dominance consistency. Building on these characterizations, we proceed to derive Kusuoka-type representations for these functionals, shedding light on their mathematical structure and intimate connections to Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall. Furthermore, we offer representations of general law-invariant star-shaped functionals as robustifications of Value-at-Risk. Notably, our results are versatile, accommodating settings that may, or may not, involve monotonicity and/or cash-additivity. All of these characterizations are developed within a general locally convex topological space of random variables, ensuring the broad applicability of our results in various financial, insurance and probabilistic contexts.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文对一类法变量星形泛函进行了新颖的表征结果。我们首先建立了正齐次和星形泛函的特征，这些特征展示了二阶或凸序随机优势一致性。在这些特征的基础上，我们继续推导了这些泛函的Kusuoka型表示，揭示了它们的数学结构和与风险价值和预期亏损的内在联系。此外，我们提出了将一般的法变量星形泛函表示为风险价值的鲁棒化表示。值得注意的是，我们的结果非常灵活，适用于可能涉及单调性和/或现金可加性的设置。所有这些特征都在一个一般的局部凸拓扑空间上的随机变量集合中得以发展，确保了我们的结果在各种金融、保险和概率背景下的广泛应用。",
