We conduct factor analysis (varimax-based rotation of the Eigenvectors) on the transpose matrix of the raw centrality metrics dataset, with the node ids as features, under the hypothesis that there are two factors (core and peripheral) that drive the values incurred by the nodes with respect to the centrality metrics. We test our approach on a diverse suite of 12 complex real-world networks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们对四个主要的邻域和最短路径中心性度量（度、特征向量、介数和接近度）的原始数据进行因子分析，并提出了一种新的定量度量指标，称为核心-中间-外围（CIP）指数，以捕捉节点在网络中能够扮演核心节点（具有任何中心性度量的较高值的网络中心）和外围节点（具有任何中心性度量的较低值的网络边缘节点）之间的关系程度。我们对中心性度量数据集的转置矩阵进行因子分析（基于特征向量的方差旋转），假设存在两个因子（核心和外围）来驱动节点相对于中心性度量所产生的值。我们在12个多样化的复杂现实世界网络上对我们的方法进行了测试。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel quantitative measure called the Core-Intermediate-Peripheral (CIP) Index, which captures the extent with which a node could play the role of a core node and a peripheral node in a network. The measure is obtained through factor analysis of the centrality metrics data of neighborhoods and shortest paths. The effectiveness of the approach is validated through testing on 12 complex real-world networks."
