    "abstract": "Electric mobility hubs (eHUBS) are locations where multiple shared electric modes including electric cars and e-bikes are available. To assess their potential to reduce private car use, it is important to investigate to what extent people would switch to eHUBS modes after their introduction. Moreover, people may adapt their behaviour differently depending on their current travel mode. This study is based on stated preference data collected in Amsterdam. We analysed the data using mixed logit models. We found users of different modes not only have a varied general preference for different shared modes, but also have different sensitivity for attributes such as travel time and cost. Compared to car users, public transport users are more likely to switch towards the eHUBS modes. People who bike and walk have strong inertia, but the percentage choosing eHUBS modes doubles when the trip distance is longer (5 or 10 km).",

    "translated_abstract": "电动交通枢纽(eHUBS)是提供多种共享电动交通工具（包括电动汽车和电动自行车）的地点。为了评估它们减少私家车使用的潜力，重要的是研究人们在引入eHUBS模式后，会多大程度地切换到这些交通工具。此外，人们可能会根据他们目前的出行方式而有不同的行为适应。本研究基于在阿姆斯特丹收集的声明偏好数据进行分析，采用了混合逻辑模型。我们发现不同出行方式的用户不仅对不同共享模式有不同的偏好，而且对于旅行时间和费用等属性的敏感性也不同。与汽车用户相比，公共交通用户更有可能转向eHUBS模式。骑行和步行的人有较强的惯性，但当行程距离更长（5或10公里）时，选择eHUBS模式的百分比翻了一番。",
