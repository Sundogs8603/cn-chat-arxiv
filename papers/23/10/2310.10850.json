    "translated_abstract": "随着在线教育技术产品越来越常见，大量证据指出，学习者往往很难建立规律的学习习惯并完成他们的课程。与此同时，面向娱乐和社交互动的在线产品有时在增加用户参与度和创造频繁使用习惯方面非常有效，却无意中导致数字上瘾，特别是在青少年中。在这个项目中，我们在一个用于印度儿童学习英语的教育应用程序上进行了基于竞赛的干预，这在娱乐环境中很常见。大约一万名随机选择的学习者参加了一个为期100天的阅读竞赛。如果他们在基于学习内容消耗量的排行榜上排名足够高，他们将赢得一套实体书籍作为奖品。比赛结束后的12周，当治疗组没有额外的激励使用该应用程序时，他们继续参与其中。",
