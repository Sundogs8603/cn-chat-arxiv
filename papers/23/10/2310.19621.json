    "translated_abstract": "在对参与联合研究的每个被试所获取的来自不同实验的多视图高维数据进行综合统计分析时，可能很具有挑战性。典型相关分析(CCA)是一种用于确定这些数据集之间关系的统计过程。在这个背景下，结构稀疏CCA(ScSCCA)是一种快速崛起的方法论领域，旨在通过假设相应的CCA方向向量是稀疏的，来对不同数据模态之间的相互关系进行鲁棒建模。虽然这是一个快速发展的统计方法学领域，但在贝叶斯范式下仍需要开发相关方法。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的ScSCCA方法，我们采用贝叶斯无穷因子模型，并通过在建模框架的两个不同级别上鼓励稀疏来实现鲁棒估计。首先，我们利用一个乘法半-Cauchy过程先验来实现稀疏建模。",
