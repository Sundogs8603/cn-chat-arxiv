    "translated_abstract": "文本到图像(T2I)合成的扩散模型，如稳定的扩散(SD)，最近展示出了生成高质量内容的卓越能力。然而，这一进展引发了对潜在滥用的几个关注，特别是在创建受版权限制、禁止和受限内容，或者不适宜工作的(NSFW)图片方面。虽然已经采取了一些措施来缓解这些问题，例如在评估阶段实施安全过滤器或通过微调模型来消除不受欢迎的概念或风格，但这些安全措施在处理各种提示方面的有效性仍然很少被探索。在这项工作中，我们旨在通过提出一种用于评估的新颖概念检索算法来研究这些安全机制。我们引入了Ring-A-Bell，这是一个面向T2I扩散模型的模型无关的红队工具，整个评估可以在没有目标模型先验知识的情况下提前准备好。具体来说，Ring-A-Bell首先对激励进行分解，然后通过去除候选概念和计算特定概念的相关度来设计筛选机制。",
