    "translated_abstract": "意图驱动的管理在下一代移动网络中将发挥关键作用，传统方法无法有效管理资源，因为它们倾向于独立处理每个期望。现有方法（如基于多智能体强化学习的方法）在网络切片上存在冲突的期望时可以有效地分配资源。然而，实际上，系统往往更加复杂，无法仅通过单独的多智能体强化学习来解决。通常存在着意图实现的层次结构，多个预训练的、自利的智能体可能需要由一个监控或控制智能体进一步协调。这些智能体可能以adhoc方式进入系统，需要与其他可用的智能体一起协调。基于整个系统的重新训练往往是不可行的，因为需要相关的时间和成本。鉴于这些挑战，需要协调预训练智能体的adhoc协调。",
