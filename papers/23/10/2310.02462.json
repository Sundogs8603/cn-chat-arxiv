    "translated_abstract": "会话辅助机器人能够帮助人们，尤其是那些认知能力受损的人，完成各种任务，如烹饪饭菜，进行锻炼，或操作机器。然而，为了有效地与人类进行交互，机器人必须能够从观察到的人类行为中识别人类的计划和目标，即使用户的行为不够优化。目前的计划和目标识别研究通常使用层次任务网络来建模人类行为者，但是这些技术不足以通过自然交互的方式实现用户参与。此外，它们也没有机制来让用户，尤其是那些认知能力受损的人，知道他们原始计划的偏离或朝着目标采取的任何次优行动。我们提出了一种新的框架，通过对话来实现部分可观察领域中的计划和目标识别，使机器人能够纠正对人类的信念。",
