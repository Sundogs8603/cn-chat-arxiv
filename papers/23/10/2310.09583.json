    "translated_abstract": "深度平衡模型（DEQs）和神经常微分方程（Neural ODEs）是两种隐式模型的分支，以其卓越的性能和低内存消耗成就了显著的成功。虽然两者都是隐式模型，但DEQs和Neural ODEs是从不同的数学形式导出的。受同伦延续的启发，我们建立了这两种模型之间的联系，并表明它们实际上是同一个硬币的两面。同伦延续是一种基于对应ODE的解非线性方程组的经典方法。给定这种联系，我们提出了一种新的隐式模型称为HomoODE，它继承了DEQs的高精度性质和Neural ODEs的稳定性。与DEQs不同，HomoODE通过同伦延续使用修改后的神经常微分方程隐式地解决平衡点找寻问题。",
