    "translated_abstract": "图对比学习（GCL）在图结构数据的表示学习中显示出了优越的性能。尽管取得了成功，但大多数现有的GCL方法依赖于预制的图增强和同类假设。因此，它们在连通节点可能具有不同类标签和不相似特征的异类图上无法很好地推广。在本文中，我们研究了在同类和异类图上进行对比学习的问题。我们发现，通过考虑邻居节点的非对称视图，我们可以实现有希望的性能。由此产生的简单算法，称为图的非对称对比学习(GraphACL)，易于实现，不依赖于图增强和同类假设。我们提供了理论和实证证据，证明GraphACL能够捕捉单跳本地邻域信息和双跳单一相似性，这两者对于建模异类图非常重要。",
