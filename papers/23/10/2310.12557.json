    "translated_abstract": "文本中的空间推理在各种实际应用中起着至关重要的作用。现有的空间推理方法通常从纯文本中推断空间关系，忽视了自然语言与符号结构之间的差距。图神经网络（GNN）在引导和聚合符号结构方面表现出了卓越的能力。然而，传统的GNN在处理多跳空间推理时面临着挑战，由于过度平滑的问题，即随着图层数量的增加，性能显著下降。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的Depth-Wise Graph Neural Network（DepWiGNN）。具体地，我们设计了一种新颖的节点记忆方案，并在图的深度维度上聚合信息，而不是在广度维度上，这样可以收集长时间的依赖关系，而无需堆叠多个层次。实验结果表明，在两个挑战数据集上，DepWiGNN可以以比传统GNN方法更高的准确性进行多跳空间推理。",
