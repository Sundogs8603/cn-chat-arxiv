    "translated_abstract": "数据预处理是任何机器学习流程中至关重要的一部分，它对性能和训练效率都有重要影响。当使用深度神经网络进行时序预测和分类时，这一点尤为明显：真实世界的时序数据通常表现出多样性、偏斜和异常值等不规则特征，如果不充分处理这些特征，模型性能很快会下降。在本研究中，我们提出了EDAIN（扩展深度自适应输入规范化）层，一种新颖的自适应神经层，它能够以端到端的方式学习如何适当地规范化不规则的时序数据，而不是使用固定的规范化方案。这通过使用反向传播算法，同时优化其未知参数和深度神经网络来实现。我们的实验证明，这一方法在使用合成数据、信用违约预测数据集和大规模限价单簿基准数据集时都取得了良好效果。",
