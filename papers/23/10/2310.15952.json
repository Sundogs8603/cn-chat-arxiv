    "translated_abstract": "尽管深度学习模型在各种医学图像分析任务中取得了显著的成功，但在真实临床环境中部署这些模型需要它们对所获取的图像的变异性具有鲁棒性。许多方法会对训练数据应用预定义的转换，以增强测试时的鲁棒性，但这些转换可能无法确保模型对患者图像中的多样性变异性具有鲁棒性。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于变换器和条件扩散模型的新型三阶段方法，旨在提高模型对实践中常见的成像变异性的鲁棒性，而无需预先确定的数据增强策略。为了实现这一目标，多个图像编码器首先学习分层特征表示来构建辨别潜在空间。接下来，一个由潜在代码引导的逆扩散过程作用于有信息先验，并提出预测候选。",
