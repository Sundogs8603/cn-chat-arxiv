    "translated_abstract": "视觉规划模拟了人类在搜索初始视觉状态和最终视觉目标状态之间的视觉因果转换来实现期望目标时所做的决策过程。在以自我为中心的视觉中，视觉规划越来越重要，因为它在引导智能体在复杂环境中执行日常任务方面具有优势。本文提出了一个可解释和可推广的视觉规划框架，包括：i）一种新颖的基于替代的概念学习器（SCL），将视觉输入转化为分解的概念表示；ii）通过自学符号进行任务规划的符号抽象和推理；iii）将视觉因果转换与语义相似的真实世界行为进行关联的视觉因果转换模型（ViCT）。给定一个初始状态，我们通过学习到的表示和因果转换的符号推理方法进行目标条件的视觉规划，以达到目标状态。",
