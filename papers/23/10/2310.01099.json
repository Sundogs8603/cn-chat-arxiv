However, most prior research has primarily focused on analyzing a single type of data, which may not capture the full complexity of HTN risk. To address this limitation, this study introduces a multimodal deep learning (MMDL) system, dubbed HyMNet, which combines fundus images and cardiometabolic risk factors, specifically age and gender, to improve hypertension detection capabilities. Our MMDL system uses RETFound, a foundation model pre-trained on 1.6 million retinal images, for the fundus path and a fully connected neural network for the age and gender path. The two paths are jointly trained by concatenating the feature vectors from each path that are then fed into a fusion network. The system was trained on 5,016 retinal images from 1,243 individuals collected from the Saudi Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs. The re",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习在预测高血压（HTN）方面表现出了潜力。然而，大多数先前的研究主要集中在分析单一类型的数据上，这可能无法捕捉到HTN风险的全部复杂性。为了解决这一限制，本研究引入了一种称为HyMNet的多模态深度学习（MMDL）系统，该系统结合了眼底图像和心脏代谢风险因素，特别是年龄和性别，以改善高血压检测能力。我们的MMDL系统使用了在160万张视网膜图像上预先训练的基础模型RETFound来进行眼底路径，并使用全连接神经网络来进行年龄和性别路径。这两个路径通过连接每个路径的特征向量进行联合训练，然后将其送入融合网络。该系统在沙特国民警卫卫生事务部收集的1,243名个体的5,016张眼底图像上进行了训练。",
