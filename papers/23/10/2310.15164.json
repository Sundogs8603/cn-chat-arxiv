    "translated_abstract": "逻辑推理是人工智能中重要的任务，它通过从一组前提中推断结论的真值，在科学、数学和社会等领域具有广泛的潜在影响。虽然已经提出了许多基于提示的策略来使大型语言模型（LLM）更有效地进行这种推理，但它们仍然表现不尽如人意，经常在微妙和难以预测的方式下失败。在这项工作中，我们探索了将这些任务重新定义为模块化的神经符号编程，我们称之为LINC：通过神经符号计算进行逻辑推理。在LINC中，LLM充当语义解析器，将自然语言的前提和结论转化为一阶逻辑表达式。然后，将这些表达式转移到外部定理证明器中，该证明器通过符号方式进行演绎推理。利用这种方法，我们观察到了显著的性能提升。",
