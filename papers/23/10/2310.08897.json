    "translated_abstract": "放射学特征学是一种通过图像提取定量手工特征来预测疾病的医学成像技术。在这些特征中进行融合，可以确保在不同的成像设备和协议中进行一致的特征提取。融合的方法包括标准化成像协议、统计调整和评估特征的稳健性。通过超声心动图可以诊断心肌疾病，如左室肥厚(LVH)和高血压心脏病(HHD)，但不同的成像设置会带来挑战。在这种情况下，特征融合技术对于在疾病诊断中应用手工特征至关重要。自监督学习(SSl)通过限制的数据集增强数据理解，并适应多样的数据设置。ConvNeXt-V2将卷积层集成到SSL中，在各种任务中展现出优越的性能。本研究侧重于SSL中的卷积滤波器，将它们用作预处理，将图像转换为特征图。",
