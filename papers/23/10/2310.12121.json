This paper addresses the persistent challenge of predicting mortality in patients with mental diagnoses using predictive machine-learning models with electronic health records (EHR). Data from patients with mental disease diagnoses were extracted from the well-known clinical MIMIC-III data set utilizing demographic, prescription, and procedural information. Four machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors) were used, with results indicating that Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models outperformed others, with AUC scores of 0.911.

    "translated_abstract": "精神障碍影响全球数百万人的生活，不仅妨碍他们的日常生活，还明显缩短了预期寿命。本文利用电子健康记录 (EHR) 中的预测机器学习模型，解决了在患有精神诊断的患者中预测死亡率的持久挑战。从众所周知的临床 MIMIC-III 数据集中提取了患有精神疾病诊断的患者的数据，利用人口统计信息、处方信息和程序信息。使用了四种机器学习算法 (逻辑回归、随机森林、支持向量机和K近邻) ，结果表明随机森林和支持向量机模型表现优于其他模型，AUC得分为0.911。特征重要性分析显示药物处方，特别是硫酸吗啡，在预测中起到了关键作用。我们应用了各种机器学习算法来预测30天内的死亡率，随后进行特征重要性分析。",
