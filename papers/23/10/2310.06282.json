    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了MuseChat，一种创新的基于对话的音乐推荐系统。这个独特的平台不仅提供互动用户参与，还为输入的视频提供了定制的音乐推荐，使用户可以改进和个性化他们的音乐选择。与之相反，以前的系统主要强调内容的兼容性，往往忽视了用户个体偏好的细微差别。例如，所有的数据集都只提供基本的音乐-视频配对，或者带有音乐描述的配对。为了填补这一空白，我们的研究提供了三个贡献。首先，我们设计了一种对话合成方法，模拟了用户和推荐系统之间的两轮交互，利用预训练的音乐标签和艺术家信息。在这个交互中，用户提交一个视频给系统，系统会提供一个合适的音乐片段，并附带解释。之后，用户会表达他们对音乐的偏好，系统会呈现一个改进后的音乐推荐",
