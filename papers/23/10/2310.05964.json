    "translated_abstract": "在一场导致互联网使用量增长70%的大流行病之后，全世界的人们开始更多地使用社交媒体。Twitter、Meta Threads、YouTube和Reddit等应用程序变得越来越普及，几乎没有任何数字空间不表达公众意见。本文研究了不同社交媒体平台上评论之间的情感和语义关系，并讨论了这些不同媒体平台上共享意见的重要性，使用词嵌入分析句子和文档中的组成部分。它使研究人员、政治家和商业代表能够追踪全球用户之间共享情感的路径。本研究论文提出了多种方法来衡量从这些热门在线平台的用户评论中提取的文本的相关性。通过利用捕捉词语间语义关系并有助于分析网络情感的嵌入方法，我们可以进行情感分析。",
