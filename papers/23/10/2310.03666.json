    "translated_abstract": "在许多领域，如医疗保健、化学和生物医学研究中，对齐术语资源（包括本体、受控词汇、分类法和值集）是数据集成的关键部分。实体映射是确定这些资源中的实体之间的对应关系的过程，例如基因标识符、疾病概念或化学实体标识符。许多工具已经开发出来，基于常见结构特征和词汇信息（如标签和同义词）来计算这种映射。特别是词汇方法通常提供非常高的召回率，但由于词义模糊，精度较低。因此，映射工作通常需要通过人工策划进行繁琐而费时的手动映射细化过程。大型语言模型（LLMs），例如ChatGPT使用的模型，具有通用能力，可以执行广泛的任务，包括问答和信息提取。在这里，我们介绍了MapperGPT，一个新的基于大型语言模型的实体链接和映射工具。",
