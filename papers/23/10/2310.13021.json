    "translated_abstract": "数学是人类开发和使用的最强大的概念系统之一。自动化数学家的梦想在人工智能领域有着悠久的历史。人工智能的快速进展，尤其是在大型语言模型 (LLM) 方面的进步，引发了对构建这样的系统的广泛兴趣。在这项工作中，我们从\"认知科学\"的角度对这些目标进行了反思。我们指出了一些来自认知科学的经典研究方向和当前研究方向，我们认为这些方向对于寻求构建真正的人类（或超人类）级数学系统的AI从业者来说是有价值的。最后，我们提出了一些需要多学科视角的开放性讨论和问题—认知科学家与人工智能研究人员和数学家共同合作—在我们朝着更好的数学AI系统迈进的过程中，这些系统不仅可以帮助我们推动数学的前沿，还可以提供一瞥",
