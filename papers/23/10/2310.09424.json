SALM comprises a frozen text LLM, a audio encoder, a modality adapter module, and LoRA layers to accommodate speech input and associated task instructions. The unified SALM not only achieves performance on par with task-specific Conformer baselines for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (AST), but also exhibits zero-shot in-context learning capabilities, demonstrated through keyword-boosting task for ASR and AST.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的具有多任务和语境学习能力的语音增强语言模型（SALM）。SALM由一个冻结的文本语言模型、一个音频编码器、一个模态适配器模块和适应语音输入和相关任务指令的LoRA层组成。统一的SALM不仅在自动语音识别（ASR）和语音翻译（AST）的任务特定Conformer基准上达到了与之相媲美的性能，还展现了零-shot语境学习能力，通过ASR和AST的关键词提升任务进行了验证。此外，我们提出了“语音监督的语境训练”来弥合LLM训练和下游语音任务之间的差距，进一步提高了语音到文本模型的语境学习能力。所提出的模型通过NeMo工具包开源。",
