    "translated_abstract": "受限策略搜索（Constrained policy search，CPS）是离线强化学习中的一个基本问题，通常通过优势加权回归（AWR）来解决。然而，由于基于高斯策略的有限表达能力，先前的方法可能仍然会遇到由于高斯策略限制而导致的超出分布的动作。另一方面，在AWR框架中直接应用具有分布表达能力的最先进模型（即扩散模型）是不可行的，因为AWR需要确切的策略概率密度，而在扩散模型中是不可行的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新方法，称为DiffCPS（Diffusion-based Constrained Policy Search），通过原始-对偶方法来解决基于扩散的受限策略搜索。理论分析表明，扩散模型基础的CPS问题存在强对偶性，引入参数近似后，可以在...",
