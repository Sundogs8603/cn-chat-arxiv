    "translated_abstract": "将一个物理5G通信基础设施分割成几个具有不同特征的虚拟网络切片，如带宽、延迟、可靠性、安全性和服务质量，这就是5G网络切片。每个切片是一个独立的逻辑网络，满足特定服务或用例的要求，如虚拟现实、游戏、自动驾驶车辆或工业自动化。网络切片可以动态调整以满足服务的变化需求，从而以更具成本效益和高效的方式在共享基础设施上提供多样化的服务和应用。本文评估了各种机器学习技术，包括逻辑回归模型、线性判别模型、k最近邻模型、决策树模型、随机森林模型、SVC BernoulliNB模型和GaussianNB模型，以研究每个模型在检测网络切片上的准确性和精度。该报告还提供了一个概述...",
