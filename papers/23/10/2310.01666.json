    "translated_abstract": "人们对专制与民主政权的利弊争论已有数千年之久。例如，《理想国》中的柏拉图更青睐于精英专制政权，认为这是启蒙的政权形式，而非民主体制。现代独裁者通常在上台时承诺快速解决社会问题和长期稳定。我提出了一个以国家最佳利益为出发点的独裁模型。该模型基于以下前提：a) 独裁者只依赖顾问的信息来决定国家发展的方向；b) 顾问的欺骗不会随时间减少；c) 顾问的欺骗程度会随国家所遇到的困难而增加。该模型展示了短期改善（几个月到一年），随后出现不稳定情况，导致国家逐渐恶化多年。我推导出了一些适用于所有独裁者的普遍参数，并证明了顾问的欺骗程度与困难程度成正比。",
