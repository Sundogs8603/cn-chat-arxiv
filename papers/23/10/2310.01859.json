    "abstract": "In estimation theory, the Kushner equation provides the evolution of the probability density of the state of a dynamical system given continuous-time observations. Building upon our recent work, we propose a new way to approximate the solution of the Kushner equation through tractable variational Gaussian approximations of two proximal losses associated with the propagation and Bayesian update of the probability density. The first is a proximal loss based on the Wasserstein metric and the second is a proximal loss based on the Fisher metric. The solution to this last proximal loss is given by implicit updates on the mean and covariance that we proposed earlier. These two variational updates can be fused and shown to satisfy a set of stochastic differential equations on the Gaussian's mean and covariance matrix. This Gaussian flow is consistent with the Kalman-Bucy and Riccati flows in the linear case and generalize them in the nonlinear one.",

    "translated_abstract": "在估计理论中，Kushner方程提供了给定连续时间观测的动态系统状态的概率密度的演化。在我们最近的工作的基础上，我们提出了一种通过可处理的变分高斯逼近来近似解决Kushner方程的新方法，其中涉及到与概率密度的传播和贝叶斯更新相关的两个接近近似损失。第一个是基于Wasserstein度量的接近损失，第二个是基于Fisher度量的接近损失。这个最后接近损失的解决方案由我们之前提出的均值和协方差的隐式更新给出。这两个变分更新可以融合并证明满足高斯均值和协方差矩阵的一组随机微分方程。这个高斯流与线性情况下的Kalman-Bucy和Riccati流一致，并在非线性情况下推广了它们。",
