    "translated_abstract": "性教育可以影响学生的性行为，并传达有关家庭形成和责任的社会规范，这对他们的未来产生重要影响。为了研究社会规范传递的生命周期效应，本研究利用瑞典小学40年代至50年代引入全面性健康教育的情况进行了调查。在这一时期，受到社会民主价值观的启发，性教育教导学生关于禁欲、理性的家庭计划选择以及对个人决策承担社会责任的重要性。该研究运用了一种先进的“差异和差异”方法来评估男性和女性在整个生命周期中各种结果。结果表明，该改革对男性和女性的大多数预期结果产生影响，最终降低了收入方面的性别不平等。该改革的影响也延伸到了下一代女性，鼓励她们拥有更多的机会和自主权。",
