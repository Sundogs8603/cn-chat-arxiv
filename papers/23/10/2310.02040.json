However, the vast number of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and the development of various metrics have led to challenges in evaluating different systems with different metrics. To address these challenges, we introduce jury, a toolkit that provides a unified evaluation framework with standardized structures for performing evaluation across different tasks and metrics.
