    "translated_abstract": "监测植物园林对于农作物管理和产出健康的收成至关重要。无人机已被用于收集多光谱图像来进行监测。然而，考虑到需要监测的面积和飞行的限制，植物病害信号只有在植物生长的后期阶段以及病害已经扩散到植物园林的大部分区域时才会变得明显。这种有限量的相关数据使得预测模型受到限制，因为算法难以有效地从不平衡或不现实的增广数据集中推广出模式。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了PlantPlotGAN，一种基于物理信息的生成模型，能够创建具有真实植被指数的合成多光谱区域图像。这些指数作为疾病检测的代理，并用来评估我们的模型能够帮助增加预测模型的准确性。结果表明，合成的图像可以用于提高预测模型的准确性。",
