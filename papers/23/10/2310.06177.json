    "translated_abstract": "蛋白质相互作用和组装对大多数生物过程都至关重要。从组成蛋白质预测组装结构（称为蛋白质对接任务）是蛋白质设计应用中的关键步骤。大多数对接的传统和深度学习方法主要集中在二进制对接上，遵循搜索、回归或生成建模范式。本文针对少有研究的多聚体（即两个或更多蛋白质）对接问题。我们引入DockGame，一个新颖的游戏理论框架用于对接——我们将蛋白质对接视为蛋白质之间的合作游戏，最终的组装结构构成与底层游戏潜力稳定均衡。由于我们无法获得真实的潜力，我们考虑两种方法——i)通过物理能量函数指导学习替代游戏潜力并通过同时梯度更新计算均衡，以及ii)探索对接问题的取样方法。",
