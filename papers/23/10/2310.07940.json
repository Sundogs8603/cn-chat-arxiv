    "translated_abstract": "研究人员长期以来一直宣扬着由物联网设备（包括智能传感器，家居和城市）推动的未来愿景。越来越多地，将智能嵌入这些设备中涉及到深度神经网络的使用。然而，它们的存储和处理需求使它们对于廉价的现成平台来说是禁止的。克服这些要求对于实现广泛适用的智能设备至关重要。虽然已经开发出了许多使模型变得更小更高效的方法，但对于特定场景最适合的方法缺乏理解。更重要的是对于边缘平台，这些选择不能与成本和用户体验相割离地进行分析。在这项工作中，我们从成本、延迟和用户体验的角度全面探索了量化、模型缩放和多模态与存储、传感器和处理器等系统组件的相互作用。我们从硬件/软件协同设计的角度进行，考虑成本、延迟和用户体验的因素。",
