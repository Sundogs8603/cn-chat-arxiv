    "abstract": "This work considers a rather general and broad class of Markov chains, Ito chains that look like Euler-Maryama discretization of some Stochastic Differential Equation. The chain we study is a unified framework for theoretical analysis. It comes with almost arbitrary isotropic and state-dependent noise instead of normal and state-independent one, as in most related papers. Moreover, our chain's drift and diffusion coefficient can be inexact to cover a wide range of applications such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, sampling, Stochastic Gradient Descent, or Stochastic Gradient Boosting. We prove an upper bound for $W_{2}$-distance between laws of the Ito chain and the corresponding Stochastic Differential Equation. These results improve or cover most of the known estimates. Moreover, for some particular cases, our analysis is the first.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一类相当一般和广泛的马尔可夫链，即Ito链，其类似于某些随机微分方程的Euler-Maruyama离散化。我们研究的链是一个统一的理论分析框架。与大多数相关论文中的正态和状态独立噪声不同，我们的链具有几乎任意各向同性和状态相关噪声。此外，我们链的漂移和扩散系数可以是精确的，以涵盖诸如随机梯度Langevin动力学、采样、随机梯度下降或随机梯度提升等广泛的应用。我们证明了Ito链与对应的随机微分方程之间的W2-距离的一个上界。这些结果改进或覆盖了大部分已知的估计。此外，对于某些特殊情况，我们的分析是第一个。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the Ito diffusion approximation of a broad class of Markov chains, known as Ito chains. Unlike most related papers, our chains feature isotropic and state-dependent noise, making them applicable to various scenarios. We establish an upper bound for the W2-distance between the Ito chain and the corresponding Stochastic Differential Equation, improving upon existing estimates and providing novel analysis for some specific cases."
