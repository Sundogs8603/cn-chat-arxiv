    "translated_abstract": "连贯性是一个语言学术语，指的是文本单元（句子、命题）之间的关系，使文本在逻辑上一致并对读者有意义。随着自然语言处理中生成模型的进展，迫切需要自动评估自动生成文本的人类感知连贯性。目前为止，关于明确评估生成文本的连贯性并分析（不）连贯性因素的工作很少。以往关于该主题的研究使用其他任务（如句子重排）作为连贯性的替代指标，而不是直接进行连贯性检测。本文介绍了一个名为CoheSentia的新型基准，用于评估自动生成文本的人类感知连贯性。我们的注释协议反映了两个角度：一个是全局角度，给出一个总体连贯性分数；另一个是逐句评分的增量角度。增量方法产生了一个（不）连贯性评估以及相应的分数。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一个名为CoheSentia的新型基准，用于评估自动生成文本的人类感知连贯性。我们的注释协议包括整体评分和逐句评分两个角度。通过此基准，可以更准确地评估生成文本的连贯性并分析其相关因素。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a novel benchmark called CoheSentia for assessing the human-perceived coherence of automatically generated texts. The annotation protocol includes both a global perspective and an incremental perspective, allowing for a more accurate assessment of coherence and analysis of factors contributing to (in)coherence in generated texts."
