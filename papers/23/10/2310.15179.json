    "translated_abstract": "鉴于多模型集合气候预测，目标是准确可靠地预测未来海平面上升，同时降低不确定性。由于气候变化对极地冰盖和海洋的影响，海平面上升影响着沿海社区和其他地区的数百万人口，因此这个问题非常重要。由于空间变异性和不确定性，如可能的临界点（例如，格陵兰或西部南极洲冰架的崩塌）、气候反馈循环（例如，云、永久冻土融化）、未来政策决策和人类行为，这个问题具有挑战性。大多数现有气候建模方法在回归或深度学习中全局使用相同的权重来组合不同的气候预测，这种方法对于准确可靠的海平面上升预测需要不同的地区采用不同的加权方案是不够的。本文提出了一种区域回归模型，解决了空间可变性和模型相互依赖的问题。",
