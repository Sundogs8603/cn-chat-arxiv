    "translated_abstract": "本文提出一种普适性的认知幽默机制，不仅限于语言交流。它借鉴了Raskin关于情节重叠的概念，并符合不一致性-解决理论框架，但是建立在约束的概念上，即数据集之间的抽象对应关系。根据这种观点，情节重叠是一种更抽象描述的现象，即约束重叠。文中引入了被忽视的论证概念，用于描述两个重叠的约束——明显的和隐蔽的。它们的输入和输出并不直接编码在话语中，而是由话语暗示，它们的重叠导致在交流的话语层面上产生另一种重叠，这种不一致性显露了出来。我们的假设是，唤起这种约束是听众解释话语的推理过程的认知效应。我们基于Hofstadter关于暗示的理论假设这一假设。",
