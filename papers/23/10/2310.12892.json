    "translated_abstract": "实现能够在世界上多种语言中表现良好的强大语言技术是多语言自然语言处理的核心目标。在这项工作中，我们对多语言任务导向对话（ToD）系统之间存在的任务性能差异进行了全面的总结和实证分析。我们首先定义了系统性能绝对和相对等价的新的量化指标，捕捉了跨语言和单个语言内的差异。通过一系列的控制性实验，我们证明了性能差异取决于多个因素：手头的ToD任务的性质，底层预训练语言模型，目标语言以及ToD注释数据的数量。我们实证地证明了当前ToD系统中存在的适应性和内在偏见：例如，使用与英语ToD数据完全平行的注释ToD数据训练的阿拉伯语或土耳其语ToD系统仍然表现出降低的ToD任务性能。除了提供一系列实证结果外，",
