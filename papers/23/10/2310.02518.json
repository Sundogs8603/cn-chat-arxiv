    "translated_abstract": "音乐即兴创作，就像即兴演讲一样，展现了即兴者的思维状态和情感特质的精妙方面。然而，揭示这种个性的具体音乐组成部分仍未被广泛探索。在大脑的统计学习和预测处理框架内，本研究考察了音乐即兴创作中不确定性和惊讶（预测误差）的时序动态。本研究采用HBSL模型分析了一个包含456段爵士即兴创作的语料库，跨越1905年至2009年，涵盖了78位不同的爵士音乐家。结果表明，尤其是在音高和音高-节奏序列中，惊讶和不确定性呈现出独特的时间模式，揭示了从20世纪初到21世纪的时代特征。相反，节奏序列在不同时代表现出一致的不确定度。此外，声学特性在不同时期保持不变。这些发现突显了节奏在音乐创作中的重要性。",
