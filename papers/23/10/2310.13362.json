    "translated_abstract": "行为测试为诊断语言错误和评估自然语言处理模型的能力提供了重要手段。然而，将行为测试应用于机器翻译系统是具有挑战性的，因为通常需要人力来制作评估这些系统在新生成的测试用例上的翻译质量的参考。现有的机器翻译行为测试工作通过在没有参考的情况下评估翻译质量来绕开这个问题，但这限制了对特定类型错误的诊断，比如单个数字或货币词的错误翻译。为了诊断通用错误，本文提出了一种基于双语翻译对生成的行为测试（BTPGBT）框架来进行机器翻译行为测试。BTPGBT的核心思想是采用一种新颖的双语翻译对生成（BTPG）方法，自动构建高质量的测试用例及其伪参考。实验结果表明，该方法能够有效诊断机器翻译系统的通用错误。",
