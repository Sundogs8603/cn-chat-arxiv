    "translated_abstract": "层次化多标签文本分类（HMTC）旨在利用标签层次结构进行多标签分类。近期关于HMTC的方法采用对比学习在生成的样本上以半监督的方式将文本和标签嵌入接近，从而解决了对输出空间施加过度约束的问题。然而，样本的生成往往引入噪声，因为它忽略了同一批次中相似样本之间的相关性。解决这个问题的一个方法是使用监督对比学习，但由于其复杂的结构化标签，这仍然是一个未被充分研究的领域。为了克服这一挑战，我们提出了一种称为$\\textbf{HJCL}$的层次感知联合监督对比学习方法，用于填补监督对比学习和HMTC之间的差距。具体而言，我们采用实例级和标签级对比学习技术，并仔细构造批次来满足标签层次结构的要求。",
