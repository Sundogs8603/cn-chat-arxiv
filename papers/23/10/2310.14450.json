    "abstract": "Stance detection is important for understanding different attitudes and beliefs on the Internet. However, given that a passage's stance toward a given topic is often highly dependent on that topic, building a stance detection model that generalizes to unseen topics is difficult. In this work, we propose using contrastive learning as well as an unlabeled dataset of news articles that cover a variety of different topics to train topic-agnostic/TAG and topic-aware/TAW embeddings for use in downstream stance detection. Combining these embeddings in our full TATA model, we achieve state-of-the-art performance across several public stance detection datasets (0.771 $F_1$-score on the Zero-shot VAST dataset). We release our code and data at https://github.com/hanshanley/tata.",

    "translated_abstract": "立场检测对于理解互联网上不同的态度和信仰很重要。然而，鉴于一篇文章对给定主题的立场往往高度依赖于该主题，建立一个能推广到未知主题的立场检测模型是困难的。在这项工作中，我们提出使用对比学习以及涵盖了各种不同主题的未标记新闻文章数据集来训练用于下游立场检测的主题无关（TAG）和主题感知（TAW）的嵌入。将这些嵌入组合在我们的完整TATA模型中，我们在几个公开的立场检测数据集上实现了最先进的性能（在Zero-shot VAST数据集上达到0.771的F1分数）。我们在https://github.com/hanshanley/tata发布了我们的代码和数据。",
