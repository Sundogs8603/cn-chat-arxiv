    "translated_abstract": "宏任务是我们日常手机活动的构建块任务（例如，“登录”或“预定航班”）。有效地提取宏任务对于理解移动交互和实现任务自动化至关重要。然而，这些宏任务在大规模情况下很难提取，因为它们可以由多个步骤组成，同时又隐藏在应用的编程组件中。在本文中，我们介绍了一种基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的新方法，以自动从随机和用户策划的移动交互轨迹中提取语义上有意义的宏任务。我们的方法产生的宏任务自动标记了自然语言描述，并且可以完全执行。为了检验提取的质量，我们进行了多项研究，包括用户评估、与人工策划任务的比较分析以及对这些宏任务的自动执行。这些实验和分析显示了我们方法的有效性以及提取的宏任务在不同的任务中的有用性。",
