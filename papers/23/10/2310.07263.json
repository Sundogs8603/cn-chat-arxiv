    "abstract": "In the pursuit of fully autonomous robotic systems capable of taking over tasks traditionally performed by humans, the complexity of open-world environments poses a considerable challenge. Addressing this imperative, this study contributes to the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to task and motion planning for robots. We propose a system architecture that orchestrates a seamless interplay between multiple cognitive levels, encompassing reasoning, planning, and motion generation. At its core lies a novel replanning strategy that handles physically grounded, logical, and semantic errors in the generated plans. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed feedback architecture, particularly its impact on executability, correctness, and time complexity via empirical evaluation in the context of a simulation and two intricate real-world scenarios: blocks world, barman and pizza preparation.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了实现完全自主的机器人系统能够接管人类传统执行的任务，开放世界环境的复杂性提出了巨大的挑战。在这一背景下，本研究为应用于机器人任务和动作规划的大规模语言模型领域做出了贡献。我们提出了一个系统架构，协调多个认知层次之间的无缝交互，包括推理、规划和动作生成。其核心是一种处理生成的计划中的物理基础、逻辑和语义错误的新型再规划策略。通过在仿真环境和两个复杂的实际场景（方块世界、酒吧和比萨制作）中进行实证评估，我们展示了所提出的反馈架构的有效性，尤其是对可执行性、正确性和时间复杂性的影响。",
