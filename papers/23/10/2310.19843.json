    "abstract": "Currently, almost all direct marketing activities take place virtually rather than in person, weakening interpersonal skills at an alarming pace. Furthermore, businesses have been striving to sense and foster the tendency of their clients to accept a marketing offer. The digital transformation and the increased virtual presence forced firms to seek novel marketing research approaches. This research aims at leveraging the power of telemarketing data in modeling the willingness of clients to make a term deposit and finding the most significant characteristics of the clients. Real-world data from a Portuguese bank and national socio-economic metrics are used to model the telemarketing decision-making process. This research makes two key contributions.

    "translated_abstract": "目前，几乎所有的直接营销活动都是通过虚拟方式而不是面对面进行的，这加快了人际交往技巧的衰退速度。此外，企业一直在努力感知和促进客户接受营销提案的倾向。数字转型和增加的虚拟存在迫使企业寻求新的营销研究方法。本研究旨在利用电话营销数据建模客户办理定期存款的意愿，并找出客户的最重要特征。使用葡萄牙银行的真实数据和国家社会经济指标来建模电话营销决策过程。本研究提供了两个重要的贡献。首先，提出了一种基于遗传算法的分类器，可以同时选择最佳的区分特征和调整分类器参数。其次，构建了一个可解释的预测模型。",
