Taking the ratio of total market value to the value of one-year dividends, we obtain a valuation-based duration of 175 years.

We find that market participants have limited information about cash flow beyond one year. Therefore, an increase in valuation duration is due to a decrease in the discount rate rather than good news about long-term growth. Accordingly, valuation duration negatively predicts annual market return with an out-of-sample R2 of 15%, robustly outperforming other predictors in the literature.

    "translated_abstract": "在科技泡沫的顶峰，仅有0.57%的市场估值来自下一年的股息。通过总市值与一年股息价值的比值，我们得到了一个基于估值的期限为175年。相比之下，在全球金融危机的高峰期，超过2.2%的市值来自下一年的股息，意味着一个期限为46年。是什么驱动了估值期限的变化？我们发现市场参与者对于一年之后的现金流信息有限。因此，估值期限的增加是由于折现率的降低，而不是关于长期增长的好消息。相应地，估值期限能够负向预测年度市场回报，其在样本外R2达到15%，在文献中鲁棒性地胜过其他预测因子。尽管股价股息比反映了整体估值水平，我们基于估值的期限测量捕捉了估值期限结构的斜率。我们展示了估值期限的重要性。",
