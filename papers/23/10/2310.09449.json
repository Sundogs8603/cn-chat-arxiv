    "translated_abstract": "本文关注于一种普遍而重要的学习问题，即双向相似性学习(PSL)。PSL涵盖了一系列重要应用，如开放式人脸识别、说话人验证、图像检索和人物再识别。PSL的目标是学习一个双向相似性函数，为正样本对（即具有相同标签的样本对）赋予更高的相似性得分，而对于负样本对（即具有不同标签的样本对）赋予较低的相似性得分。我们首先确定了PSL的一个关键要求，然后讨论了现有方法如何实现这个要求。然后，我们提出了一种令人惊讶的简单的无代理方法——SimPLE，它既不需要特征/代理规范化，也不需要角度边距，但在开放集识别中能够很好地泛化。我们将所提出的方法应用于三个具有挑战性的PSL任务：开放式人脸识别、图像检索和说话人验证。基于大规模基准的全面实验结果证明了该方法的有效性。",
