    "abstract": "Objectives: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications utilizing electronic health records (EHRs) have gained popularity, but they also introduce various types of bias. This study aims to systematically review the literature that address bias in AI research utilizing EHR data. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline. We retrieved articles published between January 1, 2010, and October 31, 2022, from PubMed, Web of Science, and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. We defined six major types of bias and summarized the existing approaches in bias handling. Results: Out of the 252 retrieved articles, 20 met the inclusion criteria for the final review. Five out of six bias were covered in this review: eight studies analyzed selection bias; six on implicit bias; five on confounding bias; four on measurement bias; two on algorithmic bias.
