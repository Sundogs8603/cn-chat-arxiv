    "translated_abstract": "跨领域推荐（CDR）是一项关键技术，通过将源领域的通用知识转移至目标领域，解决数据稀疏和冷启动问题。然而，现有的CDR模型由于固有的复杂性，其在不同场景中的适应性受到限制。为了解决这个挑战，最近的研究引入了基于共享嵌入的通用CDR模型，通过\"多任务学习\"或\"预训练，微调\"范式来捕捉跨领域通用知识。然而，这些模型通常忽视跨领域之间的广泛结构拓扑，并且在训练目标上不能完全对齐，可能导致负面的转移效果。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了基于模式的提示学习框架MOP，引入了基于模式的共享嵌入，以包含泛化的领域知识，同时适应领域内和领域间的CDR任务。具体地，我们设计了三种典型的模式：蝴蝶...",
