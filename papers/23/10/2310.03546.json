    "translated_abstract": "后验采样已被证明是解决成像逆问题的强大贝叶斯方法。最近发展起来的插拔式未调整朗之万算法（PnP-ULA）通过将物理测量模型与使用图像去噪器指定的深度学习先验相结合，成为一种有前景的蒙特卡洛采样和最小均方误差（MMSE）估计方法。然而，PnP-ULA的采样分布与不匹配的数据保真度和去噪器之间的复杂关系尚未经过理论分析。我们通过提出一种后验-L2拟度量并利用它来量化PnP-ULA在不匹配的后验分布下的显式误差界限来填补这一空白。我们在多个逆问题上对我们的理论进行了数值验证，如从高斯混合模型和图像去模糊中采样。我们的结果表明，PnP-ULA的采样分布对于测量模型和去噪器的不匹配非常敏感，并可以精确地描述其特征。",
