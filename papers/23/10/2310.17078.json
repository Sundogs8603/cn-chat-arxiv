    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的基于混合ConvNet-Transformer架构的深度学习方法，用于从步态数据中检测和分级帕金森病（PD）。我们采用了一种两步法的方法，将问题分为两个子问题。我们的混合ConvNet-Transformer模型首先区分健康和帕金森病患者。如果患者是帕金森病患者，多类别的混合ConvNet-Transformer模型确定Hoehn和Yahr（H&Y）分数，以评估PD的严重程度阶段。我们的混合架构充分利用了Convolutional Neural Networks（ConvNets）和Transformers的优势，可以准确地检测PD并确定严重程度阶段。特别是，我们利用ConvNets来捕捉数据中的局部模式和相关性，而利用Transformers来处理输入信号中的长期依赖关系。我们证明了我们的混合方法相对于其他最先进的方法具有卓越的性能，PD检测准确率达到97％。",
