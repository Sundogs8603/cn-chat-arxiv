    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的多智能体系统在协作解决复杂任务方面展现出了令人期待的能力。本研究考虑了多智能体协作中的一个基本问题：一致性寻求。当多个智能体一起工作时，我们关注的是它们如何通过智能体间的协商达成一致。为此，本研究研究了一个一致性寻求任务，其中每个智能体的状态是一个数值，并且它们通过相互协商来达成一致值。研究发现，当没有明确指导应采用哪种策略时，LLM驱动的智能体主要使用平均策略进行一致性寻求，尽管它们可能偶尔会使用其他策略。此外，本研究还分析了智能体数量、智能体个性和网络拓扑对协商过程的影响。本研究的发现有望为理解LLM驱动的多智能体行为奠定基础。",
