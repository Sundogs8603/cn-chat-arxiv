    "translated_abstract": "随着人口老龄化问题的加剧，跌倒事件的分类引起了广泛的研究关注。在深度学习的发展中，数据标签的质量至关重要。大多数数据集都是自动或半自动标记的，样本可能存在标注错误，这限制了深度神经网络（DNN）的性能。最近关于噪声标签学习的研究证实了神经网络在训练阶段首先关注干净简单的实例，然后关注噪声和困难的实例。为了解决学习噪声标签的问题并保护人类受试者的隐私，我们提出了一种简单但有效的方法，称为联合合作训练与三位一体网络（JoCoT）。为了减轻隐私问题，我们使用人体骨架数据。在提出的JoCoT中，通过使用两个教师模块和一个学生模块来改善噪声标签学习框架的鲁棒性和性能。为了减轻错误选择的问题，预测过程和rae的选择遵循了固有的约束。",
