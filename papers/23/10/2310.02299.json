Thus, we introduce relaxed octahedral group convolution for modeling 3D physical systems in this paper. This flexible convolution technique provably allows the model to both maintain the highest level of equivariance that is consistent with data and discover the subtle symmetry-breaking factors in the physical systems. Empirical results validate that our approach can not only provide insights into the symmetry-breaking factors in phase transitions but also achieves superior performance in fluid super-resolution tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度等价模型利用对称性提高样本效率和泛化性能。然而，在许多这些模型中，完美对称性的假设有时可能会限制性能，特别是当数据与这些对称性不完全一致时。因此，我们在本文中引入了用于建模3D物理系统的松弛八面体群卷积。这种灵活的卷积技术能够在保持与数据一致的最高等变性水平的同时，发现物理系统中微妙的对称性破缺因素。实证结果验证了我们的方法不仅可以揭示相变中的对称性破缺因素，还可以在流体超分辨率任务中实现卓越性能。",
