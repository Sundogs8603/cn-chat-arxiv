    "translated_abstract": "在时间序列预测方法的最新发展中，深度预测模型因能利用时间序列中的隐藏特征模式来提升预测性能而受到关注。然而，当前大部分深度预测模型都是不透明的，因此结果的解释具有挑战性。虽然逆向解释已广泛应用于解释分类模型的后处理方法，但其在预测模型中的应用仍相对较少。本文提出了一种新颖的时间序列预测逆向生成问题，并提出了一种名为ForecastCF的算法，通过对原始时间序列施加基于梯度的扰动来解决这一问题。ForecastCF通过对预测值施加约束指导扰动以获得所需的预测结果。我们使用四种最先进的深度模型架构对ForecastCF进行实验评估，并与现有的方法进行比较。",
