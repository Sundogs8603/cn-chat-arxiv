We present MindfulDiary, a mobile journaling app incorporating an LLM to help psychiatric patients document daily experiences through conversation. Designed in collaboration with mental health professionals (MHPs), MindfulDiary takes a state-based approach to safely comply with the experts' guidelines while carrying on free-form conversations. Through a four-week field study involving 28 patients with major depressive disorder and five psychiatrists, we found that MindfulDiary supported patients in consistently enriching their daily records and helped psychiatrists better empathize with their patients through an understanding of their thoughts and daily contexts.

    "translated_abstract": "在心理健康领域，大型语言模型（LLMs）提供了新的机会，然而其复杂性和低可控性引发了关于其在临床环境中适用性的质疑。我们介绍了MindfulDiary，一个移动日记应用，结合LLM帮助精神病患者通过对话记录日常体验。与心理健康专业人士（MHPs）合作设计，MindfulDiary采取基于状态的方法，安全地遵守专家指南，同时进行自由形式的对话。通过涉及28名重性抑郁障碍患者和5名精神科医生的为期四周的实地研究，我们发现MindfulDiary支持患者持续丰富其日常记录，并帮助精神科医生通过理解他们的想法和日常背景更好地同情他们的患者。根据这些发现，我们讨论了其影响。",
