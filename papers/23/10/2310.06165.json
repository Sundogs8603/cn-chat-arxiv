    "abstract": "State-of-the-art coreference resolutions systems depend on multiple LLM calls per document and are thus prohibitively expensive for many use cases (e.g., information extraction with large corpora). The leading word-level coreference system (WL-coref) attains 96.6% of these SOTA systems' performance while being much more efficient. In this work, we identify a routine yet important failure case of WL-coref: dealing with conjoined mentions such as 'Tom and Mary'. We offer a simple yet effective solution that improves the performance on the OntoNotes test set by 0.9% F1, shrinking the gap between efficient word-level coreference resolution and expensive SOTA approaches by 34.6%. Our Conjunction-Aware Word-level coreference model (CAW-coref) and code is available at https://github.com/KarelDO/wl-coref.",

    "translated_abstract": "当前最先进的共指消解系统每篇文章需要多次调用语言模型，因此对于许多应用场景来说（例如使用大规模语料库进行信息提取），代价太高。而词级共指系统 (WL-coref) 在效率上更加高效，实现了这些最先进系统 96.6% 的性能。本文发现了 WL-coref 的一个常见但重要的失败案例：处理“Tom 和 Mary”之类的并列提及。我们提供了一个简单但有效的解决方案，在 OntoNotes 测试集上将性能提高了 0.9% F1，将高效的词级共指消解与昂贵的最先进方法的差距缩小了34.6%。我们的关联词感知的词级共指模型（CAW-coref）和代码可在 https://github.com/KarelDO/wl-coref 获取。",
