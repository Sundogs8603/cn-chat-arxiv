    "translated_abstract": "在公平机器学习的文献中，我们经常观察到准确性和公平性之间的权衡。然而，对于这一长期存在的挑战，缺乏严格的理论分析。为了揭示这个挑战，本研究通过对准确性和公平性之间的权衡帕累托前沿进行建模，发展了一个理论框架。准确性和公平性之间的权衡帕累托前沿是由一组所有最优帕累托分类器组成的，没有其他分类器能够支配。具体地，我们首先在现实场景中证明了该权衡的存在，然后提出了四个潜在的分类来表征准确性和公平性帕累托前沿的重要特性。对于每个分类，我们确定了导致相应权衡的必要条件。在合成数据的实验结果中，我们对所提出的框架得出了有见地的发现：（1）当敏感属性可以完全通过非敏感属性进行解释时，权衡帕累托前沿大多是连续的。（2）准确性可能会受到...",
