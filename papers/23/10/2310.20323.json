    "translated_abstract": "目前的技术在从复杂的语义描述中生成运动时面临困难，主要原因是数据集中缺乏足够的语义注释和弱的上下文理解。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了SemanticBoost，一个新颖的框架，同时解决了这两个挑战。我们的框架包括语义增强模块和上下文调节运动去噪器（CAMD）。语义增强模块从运动数据中提取补充语义，丰富数据集的文本描述，并确保文本和运动数据之间的准确对齐，而不依赖于大型语言模型。另一方面，CAMD方法通过有效捕捉上下文信息并将生成的运动与给定的文本描述对齐，提供了一个全面的解决方案来生成高质量、语义一致的运动序列。与现有方法不同，我们的方法可以合成准确的定向运动。",
