The primary structure of a peptide can be represented either as an amino acid sequence or as a molecular graph consisting of atoms and chemical bonds.

Despite the fact that these models learn representations of the same modality of peptides, we find that they explain their predictions differently. Considering sequential and graphical models as two experts making inferences from different perspectives, we work on fusing expert knowledge to enrich the learned representations for improving the discriminative performance. To achieve this, we propose a peptide co-modeling method, RepCon, which employs a contrastive learning-based framework to enhance the mutual information of representations from decoupled sequential and graphical end-to-end models.

    "translated_abstract": "肽是由多个氨基酸的脱水缩合形成的。肽的主要结构可以表示为氨基酸序列或由原子和化学键组成的分子图。先前的研究表明，针对顺序和图形肽形式的深度学习路径在下游任务上表现相似。尽管这些模型学习了同一种肽的表示，但我们发现它们解释其预测的方式不同。将顺序和图形模型视为从不同角度进行推理的两个专家，我们致力于融合专家知识，丰富学到的表示以提高判别性能。为实现这一目标，我们提出了一种肽合模式化方法RepCon，它采用对比学习框架，增强从解耦的顺序和图形端到端模型的表示的相互信息。",
