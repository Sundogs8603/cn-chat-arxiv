    "abstract": "Document image classification is different from plain-text document classification and consists of classifying a document by understanding the content and structure of documents such as forms, emails, and other such documents. We show that the only existing dataset for this task (Lewis et al., 2006) has several limitations and we introduce two newly curated multilingual datasets WIKI-DOC and MULTIEURLEX-DOC that overcome these limitations. We further undertake a comprehensive study of popular visually-rich document understanding or Document AI models in previously untested setting in document image classification such as 1) multi-label classification, and 2) zero-shot cross-lingual transfer setup. Experimental results show limitations of multilingual Document AI models on cross-lingual transfer across typologically distant languages. Our datasets and findings open the door for future research into improving Document AI models.",

    "translated_abstract": "文档图像分类与纯文本文档分类不同，它涉及对表单、电子邮件等文档的内容和结构进行分类。我们发现现有唯一的数据集存在一些限制，并介绍了两个新的多语言数据集——WIKI-DOC和MULTIEURLEX-DOC，克服了这些限制。我们进一步在以前未经测试的设置下对常见的视觉丰富文档理解或文档AI模型进行全面研究，如1）多标签分类，和2）零样本跨语言迁移设置。实验结果显示了跨语言迁移距离较远的语言上多语言文档AI模型的限制。我们的数据集和发现为未来改进文档AI模型的研究打开了大门。",
