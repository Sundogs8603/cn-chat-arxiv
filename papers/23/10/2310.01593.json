    "translated_abstract": "近年来，灾热发生大火的威胁不断加剧，因此需要有效的规定火管理。传统上，基于过程的计算机模拟被用于规划预防野火的规定火。然而，即使是简化的过程模型如QUIC-Fire也过于计算密集，无法用于实时决策，特别是当天气条件迅速变化时。传统的火灾建模的机器学习方法可以提供计算速度加快，但在物理上不一致的预测，由于类别不平衡而引起的有偏预测，火灾蔓延指标（如燃烧面积、蔓延速度）的有偏估计以及在分布外的风条件下的可推广性上存在挑战。本文提出了一种新颖的机器学习（ML）框架，旨在快速模拟规定火，并解决了这些问题。通过结合领域知识，所提出的方法有助于减少燃料密度估计中的物理不一致性。",
