    "translated_abstract": "逻辑回归赌博机是建模用户选择的普遍框架，例如广告推荐系统中的点击与否。我们观察到先前的工作忽视或忽略了$S \\geq \\lVert \\theta_\\star \\rVert_2$中的依赖关系，其中$\\theta_\\star \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$是未知的参数向量，当$S$较大时，例如$S \\geq d$，这会产生问题。在这项工作中，我们通过一种称为“遗憾到置信集转换（R2CS）”的新方法改善了对$S$的依赖关系，该方法允许我们构建一个基于在线学习算法存在性的凸置信集。使用R2CS，我们在逻辑回归赌博机的遗憾界限方面获得了严格的改进，同时保持了计算可行性和对其他因素（如$d$和$T$）的依赖。我们将我们的新置信集应用于具有新的鞅集中步骤的逻辑回归赌博机的遗憾分析，从而避免了额外的因素。",
