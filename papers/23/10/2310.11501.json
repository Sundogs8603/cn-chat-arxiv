    "abstract": "Recent work has aimed to capture nuances of human behavior by using LLMs to simulate responses from particular demographics in settings like social science experiments and public opinion surveys. However, there are currently no established ways to discuss or evaluate the quality of such LLM simulations. Moreover, there is growing concern that these LLM simulations are flattened caricatures of the personas that they aim to simulate, failing to capture the multidimensionality of people and perpetuating stereotypes. To bridge these gaps, we present CoMPosT, a framework to characterize LLM simulations using four dimensions: Context, Model, Persona, and Topic. We use this framework to measure open-ended LLM simulations' susceptibility to caricature, defined via two criteria: individuation and exaggeration. We evaluate the level of caricature in scenarios from existing work on LLM simulations. We find that for GPT-4, simulations of certain demographics (political and marginalized groups) and",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究致力于使用语言模型(LLMs)模拟特定人口群体在社会科学实验和舆论调查等情境中的反应，以捕捉人类行为的细微差别。然而，目前还没有确定的方法来讨论或评估这种LLM模拟的质量。此外，人们越来越担心这些LLM模拟是对他们所模拟的人物进行夸张刻板化的表现，未能捕捉到人的多维性并延续了刻板印象。为了弥补这些差距，我们提出了CoMPosT框架，用四个维度来描述LLM模拟：语境、模型、角色和主题。我们使用这个框架来衡量开放式LLM模拟对夸张刻板化的敏感性，通过两个标准来定义：个性化和夸张。我们评估了现有LLM模拟工作中的场景中夸张刻板化的程度。我们发现对于GPT-4，特定群体（政治和边缘群体）和",
