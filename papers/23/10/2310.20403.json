    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一个由多个基站组成的联合感知和通信（JSC）网络的性能，这些基站通过一个融合中心（FC）合作，交换有关感知环境的信息，同时与一组用户设备（UEs）建立通信链路。网络中的每个基站都作为一个单兵雷达系统运行，能够对监测区域进行全面扫描，并生成提供关于一组异构物体位置的距离-角度图。获取到的地图随后在FC中进行融合。然后，采用卷积神经网络（CNN）来推断目标的类别，例如行人或车辆，并且这些信息被自适应聚类算法利用，从而更有效地将来自同一目标的检测结果进行分组。最后，采用了两种多目标跟踪算法，即概率假设密度（PHD）滤波器和多伯努利混合滤波算法。",
