    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们解决了在图像对之间匹配语义相似关键点的挑战。现有研究表明，稳定扩散（SD）中UNet的中间输出可以作为这种匹配任务的稳健图像特征图。我们证明通过采用基本的提示调整技术，可以发挥稳定扩散的固有潜力，从而显著提高准确性。我们进一步引入了一种新颖的条件提示模块，该模块将提示条件设置为输入图像对的局部细节，这进一步提高了性能。我们将我们的方法称为SD4Match，即稳定扩散用于语义匹配。对PF-Pascal、PF-Willow和SPair-71k数据集上对SD4Match的全面评估显示，它在所有这些数据集上均设立了新的准确性基准。",
