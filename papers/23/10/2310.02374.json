    "translated_abstract": "会话式健康代理（CHAs）是一种互动系统，旨在通过进行共情对话和处理多模态数据来增强个人健康护理服务。当前的CHAs，特别是那些利用大型语言模型（LLMs）的系统，主要关注对话，但往往缺乏全面的代理能力。这包括从可穿戴设备、全天候数据收集源和电子健康记录中获取个人用户的健康数据的能力，以及整合最新发布的健康见解，并与已建立的多模态数据分析工具连接。我们正在开发一个框架，通过赋予CHAs批判性思维、知识获取和问题解决能力来增强它们的能力。我们的CHA平台由LLMs驱动，无缝集成了医疗工具，实现了多语言和多模态对话，并与各种用户数据分析工具进行接口。我们展示了其在处理复杂医疗任务方面的熟练性。",
