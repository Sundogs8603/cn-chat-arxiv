    "translated_abstract": "自主车辆面临的主要挑战之一是准确预测周围环境中其他物体的运动，如行人或其他车辆。在本文中，我们开发了一种用于自主车辆的新型运动预测方法，受到Gilles等人的工作的启发。我们利用基于神经网络的模型为自主车辆附近的每个交通参与者预测多个热图，每个时间步预测一个热图。这些热图被用作提取最可能的未来位置对应坐标的一种新型抽样算法的输入。我们尝试了不同的编码器和解码器，以及两种损失函数的比较。此外，我们还引入了一种新的网格缩放技术，进一步提高了性能。总体上，我们的方法在3秒函数相关预测间隔的误差率性能上改进了最先进的水平，同时在更长的预测间隔下也具有竞争力。",
