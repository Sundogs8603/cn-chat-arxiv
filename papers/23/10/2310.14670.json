    "translated_abstract": "视觉-语言（VL）理解任务通过多项选择问题评估模型对复杂视觉场景的理解能力。然而，我们发现模型可以利用两种数据集偏差作为无需正确理解即可正确解决各种VL任务的捷径。第一种数据集偏差是\"不平衡匹配\"偏差，即正确答案与问题和图像的重叠程度超过错误答案。第二种数据集偏差是\"分心相似性\"偏差，即错误答案与正确答案过于不相似，但与同一个样本中的其他错误答案相似。为了解决这些数据集偏差，我们首先提出了对抗数据合成（ADS）来生成合成的训练和去偏差的评估数据。然后，我们引入了样本内 对立训练（ICT）来帮助模型利用合成的训练数据，特别是对立事实数据，通过注重样本内的差异来进行训练。",
