    "translated_abstract": "通过Deepfake的面部伪造已经引发了重大的安全风险并引起了严重的社会关切。为了应对这一问题，提出了许多Deepfake检测方法。其中大多数方法将Deepfake检测建模为使用预训练的骨干卷积神经网络(CNN)架构进行二分类的问题。这些基于CNN的方法在Deepfake检测方面表现出非常高的效果，曲线下面积(AUC)高达0.99。然而，当被应用于不同数据集和Deepfake操纵技术进行评估时，这些方法的性能会显著下降。因此，我们需要学习更加微妙、局部和有辨别力的特征来进行Deepfake检测。本文将Deepfake检测问题视为细粒度分类问题，并提出了一个新的细粒度解决方案。具体而言，我们的方法通过有效地抑制背景噪声和学习区分性特征来学习微妙且具有一般性的特征。",
