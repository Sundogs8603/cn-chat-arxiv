    "translated_abstract": "物联网（Internet of Things）是指互联的物理设备、车辆、家用电器等嵌入传感器、软件和连接性的网络，使它们能够收集和交换数据。物联网取证是从物联网设备收集和分析数字证据，以调查可能发生在这些连接设备上的网络犯罪、安全漏洞和其他恶意活动。特别是，电磁侧信道分析(EM-SCA)已成为物联网取证的重要工具，因为它能够在不干预这些设备或窃听它们的网络的情况下，揭示有关物联网设备内部运作的机密信息。然而，设备的变化性、环境因素以及数据收集和处理方法会限制EM-SCA结果的准确性和可靠性。此外，对于跨物联网设备可移植性的EM-SCA方法的准确性受到的限制几乎没有研究，也有限制。",
