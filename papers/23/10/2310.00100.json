    "translated_abstract": "放射学报告的印象部分总结了重要的放射学发现，并在向医生传达这些发现时起到了关键作用。然而，对于放射科医生来说，准备这些摘要既耗时又容易出错。最近，已经开发了许多用于放射学报告摘要的模型。然而，目前还没有能够在多种语言中总结这些报告的模型。这样的模型可以极大地改进未来的研究和融合来自不同族裔背景的患者数据的深度学习模型的发展。本研究通过在公开可用的基于多语言文本到文本变换器的模型上微调，自动化地生成了不同语言的放射学印象，以总结英语、葡萄牙语和德语的放射学报告中的发现。在一项盲测中，两位有执业资格的放射科医生表示，对于至少70%的系统生成的摘要，其质量",
