We propose a method for learning optimal robust classification trees based on mixed-integer robust optimization technology. In particular, we demonstrate that the problem of learning an optimal robust tree can be cast as a single-stage mixed-integer robust optimization problem with a highly nonlinear and discontinuous objective.

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑学习对训练和测试/部署数据之间的分布变化具有鲁棒性的分类树的问题。这个问题经常在高风险环境中出现，例如公共卫生和社会工作，其中数据通常是通过自我报告的调查收集的，这些调查对问题的表述方式、调查进行的时间和地点、以及受访者与调查员分享信息的舒适程度非常敏感。我们提出了一种基于混合整数鲁棒优化技术的学习最优鲁棒分类树的方法。特别地，我们证明学习最优鲁棒树的问题可以等价地表达为一个具有高度非线性和不连续目标的单阶段混合整数鲁棒优化问题。我们将这个问题等价地重新表述为一个两阶段线性鲁棒优化问题，为此我们设计了一个基于约束生成的定制解决过程。",
