    "abstract": "An important application scenario of precision agriculture is detecting and measuring crop health threats using sensors and data analysis techniques. However, the textual data are still under-explored among the existing solutions due to the lack of labelled data and fine-grained semantic resources. Recent research suggests that the increasing connectivity of farmers and the emergence of online farming communities make social media like Twitter a participatory platform for detecting unfamiliar plant health events if we can extract essential information from unstructured textual data. ChouBERT is a French pre-trained language model that can identify Tweets concerning observations of plant health issues with generalizability on unseen natural hazards. This paper tackles the lack of labelled data by further studying ChouBERT's know-how on token-level annotation tasks over small labeled sets.",

    "translated_abstract": "精密农业的一个重要应用场景是利用传感器和数据分析技术检测和测量作物健康威胁。然而，由于缺乏标记数据和细粒度语义资源，现有解决方案对文本数据仍未充分探索。最近的研究表明，农民之间日益增长的互联性和在线农业社区的出现使得Twitter等社交媒体成为检测陌生的植物健康事件的广泛参与平台，前提是我们能够从非结构化的文本数据中提取关键信息。ChouBERT是一个法语预训练语言模型，能够识别涉及植物健康问题观察的推文，并对未见过的自然灾害具有一般化能力。本文通过进一步研究ChouBERT在小型标记数据集上的令牌级注释任务，解决了标记数据不足的问题。",
