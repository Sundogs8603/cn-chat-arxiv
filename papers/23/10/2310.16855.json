    "abstract": "The stock market has been established since the 13th century, but in the current epoch of time, it is substantially more practicable to anticipate the stock market than it was at any other point in time due to the tools and data that are available for both traditional and algorithmic trading. There are many different machine learning models that can do time-series forecasting in the context of machine learning. These models can be used to anticipate the future prices of assets and/or the directional bias of assets. In this study, we examine and contrast the effectiveness of three different machine learning algorithms, namely, logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest to forecast the movement of the assets traded on the Japanese stock market. In addition, the models are compared to a feed forward deep neural network, and it is found that all of the models consistently reach above 50% in directional bias forecasting for the stock market. The results of our study contribute to",

    "translated_abstract": "股票市场自13世纪以来已经建立，但在当前时代，由于可用于传统和算法交易的工具和数据，相对于任何其他时期，预测股票市场变得更加可行。在机器学习的背景下，有许多不同的模型可以进行时间序列预测。这些模型可以用来预测资产的未来价格和/或方向性偏差。在本研究中，我们考察和对比了三种不同的机器学习算法，即逻辑回归、决策树和随机森林，来预测日本股市交易的资产的价格走势。此外，我们还将模型与前馈深度神经网络进行比较，发现所有模型在股票市场的方向性偏差预测上一致达到50%以上。本研究的结果提供了对预测股票市场方向性偏差的有效性的贡献。",
