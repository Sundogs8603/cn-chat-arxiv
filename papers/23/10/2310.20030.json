    "translated_abstract": "黎曼扩散模型从标准欧几里得空间扩散模型中汲取灵感，学习在一般流形上的分布。不幸的是，额外的几何复杂性使得扩散过渡项无法用闭式表达式表示，因此先前的方法只能使用粗略的近似方法来降低性能并阻止在高维度下的应用。在这项工作中，我们重新审视这些近似方法，并提出几个实用的改进方法。我们的关键观察是，大多数相关流形是对称空间，这些对称空间在计算上更容易处理。通过利用和组合各种方法，我们可以快速计算相关的量到高精度。在低维数据集上，我们的校正产生了明显的改进，使扩散能够与其他方法竞争。此外，我们展示了我们的方法使我们能够在非平凡流形上扩展到高维任务。",
