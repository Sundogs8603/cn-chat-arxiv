    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的变分框架，用于对由马尔科夫近似的分数布朗运动驱动的（神经）随机微分方程（SDEs）进行推断。SDEs是一种模拟具有固有噪声和随机性的现实连续时间动态系统的多功能工具。将SDEs与变分方法的强大推断能力相结合，通过随机梯度下降学习代表性函数分布。然而，传统的SDEs通常假设底层噪声遵循布朗运动（BM），这限制了它们捕捉长期相关性的能力。相反，分数布朗运动（fBM）将BM扩展到包括非马尔科夫动力学，但现有的推断fBM参数的方法要么计算求解复杂，要么在统计上低效。在本文中，我们基于fBM的马尔科夫近似，推导出用于高效变分推断的证据下界。",
