Combining the list with proprietary data, we construct a structural matching model to describe the historical transition of the importance of a firm's age, size, and geographical proximity on merger decisions. We find that, as a positive factor, a firm's size is more important than a firm's age by 9.974 times as a merger incentive between 1991 and 2005. However, between 2006 and 2022, as a negative factor, a firm's size is more important than a firm's age by 0.026-0.630 times, that is, a firm's size works as a disincentive. We also find that the distance between buyer and seller firms works as a disincentive for the whole period, but the importance has dwindled to economic insignificance in recent years.

    "translated_abstract": "我们构建了一个新颖的全球集装箱航运行业1966年至2022年之间的统一合并清单。将该清单与专有数据结合，我们构建了一个结构匹配模型，描述了公司的年龄、规模和地理邻近性在合并决策中的历史性转变。我们发现，在1991年至2005年期间，作为正面因素，一家公司的规模在合并激励中比公司的年龄重要9.974倍。然而，在2006年至2022年期间，作为负面因素，一家公司的规模在合并激励中比公司的年龄重要0.026-0.630倍，即公司的规模起到了抑制作用。我们还发现，买方公司和卖方公司之间的距离在整个期间都起到了抑制作用，但在近年来的经济重要性已减弱到微不足道的程度。在反事实模拟中，我们观察到同一国家的公司之间合并的禁止会影响合并配置。",

The study finds that firm size is a more important factor for merger incentives than firm age during the period of 1991-2005, but becomes a disincentive between 2006-2022. Additionally, the geographical distance between buyer and seller firms has a diminishing impact on merger decisions in recent years."
