DyR optimizes distribution grid switch settings in real-time to minimize grid losses and dispatches resources to supply loads with available generation. DyR is a mixed-integer problem and can be computationally intractable to solve for large grids and at fast timescales. We propose GraPhyR, a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network (GNNs) framework tailored for DyR. We incorporate essential operational and connectivity constraints directly within the GNN framework and train it end-to-end. Our results show that GraPhyR is able to learn to optimize the DyR task.",
