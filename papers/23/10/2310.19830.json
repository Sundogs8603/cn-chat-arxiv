The dataset encompasses Bielefeld, Blackorpington, Brahma, Buckeye, Fayoumi, Leghorn, Newhampshire, Plymouthrock, Sussex, and Turken breeds, offering a diverse representation of poultry commonly bred worldwide. A total of 1010 original JPG images were meticulously collected, showcasing the physical attributes, feather patterns, and distinctive features of each hen breed. These images were subsequently standardized, resized, and converted to PNG format for consistency within the dataset. The compilation, although unevenly distributed across the breeds, provides a rich resource, serving as a foundation for research and applications in poultry science, genetics, and agricultural studies.
