    "translated_abstract": "计算模型在测试样本上的准确率并从中推断其置信度是机器学习中的一个核心问题，与不确定性表示、模型选择和探索等重要应用密切相关。虽然这些连接在独立同分布设置中已经被广泛研究，但数据分布的偏移给传统方法带来了重大挑战。因此，在非监督领域适应问题中，模型校准和模型选择仍然具有挑战性，这是一种在没有标签的情况下在数据分布发生偏移的领域中表现良好的场景。在本文中，我们通过开发一种新颖的加权群准确率估计器来解决由于数据分布的偏移而带来的困难。具体而言，我们制定了一个优化问题，找到导致在数据分布偏移的领域中准确估计群准确率的重要权重，并进行了理论分析。大量实验结果表明了群准确率估计在模型上的有效性。",
