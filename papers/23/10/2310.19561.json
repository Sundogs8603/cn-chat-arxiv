    "translated_abstract": "许多机器人学习工具都是针对欧几里得数据设计的。然而，在机器人学中，许多应用涉及到流形值数据。一个常见的例子是姿态；它可以表示为3x3的旋转矩阵或四元数，其空间是非欧几里得流形。在机器人学习中，流形值数据通常通过将流形与合适的欧几里得空间相关联来处理，可以通过嵌入流形或将数据投影到一个或多个切空间来实现。这些方法可能导致预测准确性不高和算法复杂。在本文中，我们提出了一种在流形内直接进行回归的“固有”方法。它涉及对流形上的适当概率分布进行操作，将其参数作为预测变量（如时间）的函数，并通过“局部似然”方法来非参数估计该函数，其中包含核函数。我们将该方法命名为核化似然估计。",
