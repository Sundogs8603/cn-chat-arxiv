We present TlT which, given a table and a selection of the content, first produces LFs and then the textual statement. We show for the first time that automatic LFs improve quality, with an increase in fidelity of 30 points over a comparable system not using LFs. Our experiments allow to quantify the remaining challenges for high factual correctness, with automatic selection of content coming first, followed by better Logic-to-Text generation and, to a lesser extent, better Table-to-Logic parsing.",

    "translated_abstract": "表格到文本系统从结构化数据（如表格）生成自然语言陈述。虽然端到端技术在事实准确性方面存在问题，但先前的研究报告称，在使用手动逻辑形式（LF）表示所选内容和目标文本的语义时，获得了提升。鉴于手动步骤，不清楚自动LF是否有效，或者改进来自内容选择本身。我们提出了TlT，给定一个表格和内容选择，首先生成LF，然后生成文本陈述。我们首次展示了自动LF提高质量的效果，与不使用LF的类似系统相比，准确性提高了30个百分点。我们的实验对于高准确性还面临着一些挑战，自动内容选择是首要问题，其次是更好的逻辑到文本生成，以及较少程度的更好的表格到逻辑解析。",
