    "translated_abstract": "使用生成模型（如GAN或VAE）生成多样化的对象（如图像）在最近几年取得了令人瞩目的成果，以帮助解决许多传统上由人类完成的设计问题。我们的目标是超越图像生成，在更一般的设计问题中寻找解决方案，其中设计的多样性和约束的一致性都很重要。这样的设置在计算机图形学、动画、工业设计、材料科学等领域中都有应用，其中我们希望生成器的输出遵循离散/组合约束并惩罚任何偏离，这对于现有的生成模型和优化求解器来说是非平凡的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了GenCO，一种新颖的框架，它集成了嵌入的组合求解器和深层生成模型的端到端训练，旨在发现与非线性目标一致的高质量解决方案。",
