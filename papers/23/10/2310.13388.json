    "abstract": "Audio fingerprinting is a well-established solution for song identification from short recording excerpts. Popular methods rely on the extraction of sparse representations, generally spectral peaks, and have proven to be accurate, fast, and scalable to large collections. However, real-world applications of audio identification often happen in noisy environments, which can cause these systems to fail. In this work, we tackle this problem by introducing and releasing a new audio augmentation pipeline that adds noise to music snippets in a realistic way, by stochastically mimicking real-world scenarios. We then propose and release a deep learning model that removes noisy components from spectrograms in order to improve peak-based fingerprinting systems' accuracy. We show that the addition of our model improves the identification performance of commonly used audio fingerprinting systems, even under noisy conditions.",

    "translated_abstract": "音频指纹识别是一种从简短录音片段中识别歌曲的成熟解决方案。流行的方法依赖于抽取稀疏表示，通常是频谱峰值，并且已经证明准确、快速，并可扩展到大型集合。然而，在现实世界中，音频识别的应用往往发生在嘈杂的环境中，这可能导致这些系统失效。在这项工作中，我们通过引入和发布一个新的音频增强流水线来解决这个问题，该流水线以一种逼真的方式向音乐片段添加噪声，通过随机模拟现实世界的场景。然后，我们提出并发布了一个深度学习模型，该模型从谱图中去除噪声成分，以提高基于峰值的指纹识别系统的准确性。我们证明了我们的模型的添加改进了常用音频指纹识别系统的识别性能，即使在嘈杂的条件下也是如此。",
