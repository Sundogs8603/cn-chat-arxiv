    "translated_abstract": "多模态影片类型分类一直被视为一项具有挑战性的多标签分类任务，由于多模态数据（如海报、剧情摘要、预告片和元数据）的多样性。尽管现有的研究在建模和组合每个模态方面取得了巨大进展，但仍面临着三个问题：1）未利用元数据中的群组关系，2）不可靠的注意力分配，3）不可区分的融合特征。鉴于已证明知识图包含丰富的信息，我们提出了一个新的框架，从不同的角度利用知识图来解决上述问题。首先，我们将元数据处理成一个领域知识图。我们采用一种知识图嵌入的翻译模型来捕捉实体之间的关系。首先，通过利用元数据中的群组关系，我们从知识图中检索相关的嵌入，然后与其他模态进行整合。接下来，我们引入了一种注意力机制，这种机制是自监督的，并采用了对比学习方法来改进注意力分配的可靠性。最后，我们采用一种分类器来进行影片类型分类，该分类器利用了不同模态的融合特征和注意力权重。通过实验证明，我们的方法在多个数据集上均取得了优异的性能。",
