    "abstract": "Hedge fund managers with the first-loss scheme charge a management fee, a performance fee and guarantee to cover a certain amount of investors' potential losses. We study how parties can choose a mutually preferred first-loss scheme in a hedge fund with the manager's first-loss deposit and investors' assets segregated. For that, we solve the manager's non-concave utility maximization problem, calculate Pareto optimal first-loss schemes and maximize a decision criterion on this set. The traditional 2% management and 20% performance fees are found to be not Pareto optimal, neither are common first-loss fee arrangements. The preferred first-loss coverage guarantee is increasing as the investor's risk-aversion or the interest rate increases. It decreases as the manager's risk-aversion or the market price of risk increases. The more risk averse the investor or the higher the interest rate, the larger is the preferred performance fee. The preferred fee schemes significantly decrease the fund",

    "translated_abstract": "具有首段赔偿计划的对冲基金经理收取管理费、绩效费，并保证覆盖一定量的投资者潜在损失。我们研究了在基金经理的首段赔付存款和投资者的资产分离的情况下，各方如何选择互相喜好的首段赔偿计划。为此，我们解决了基金经理的非凹性效用最大化问题，计算了帕累托最优的首段赔偿计划，并在这个集合上最大化决策标准。传统的管理费2%和绩效费20%被发现不是帕累托最优的，常见的首段赔偿费安排也不是。随着投资者的风险厌恶程度或利率的增加，首选的首段赔偿保障增加。随着基金经理的风险厌恶程度或风险市场价格的增加，它会减少。投资者的风险厌恶程度越高或利率越高，首选的绩效费就越高。首选的费用计划极大地减少了基金的风险。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates optimal fee arrangements in hedge funds with first-loss compensation schemes, finding that traditional management and performance fees are suboptimal. The preferred fee schemes involve increasing first-loss coverage guarantee and performance fees with higher investor risk aversion and interest rates, reducing the fund's risk."
