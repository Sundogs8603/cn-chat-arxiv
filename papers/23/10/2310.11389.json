    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了在马尔可夫成本过程中估计无限时间折现成本的风险价值（Value-at-Risk，VaR）和条件风险价值（Conditional Value-at-Risk，CVaR）的问题。首先，我们推导出一个最小最大下界，该下界在期望意义和概率意义下都成立，其误差界为$\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{n})$。然后，利用有限时间截断方案，我们推导出CVaR估计误差的上界，该上界与我们的下界匹配，只有常数因子的差异。最后，我们讨论了我们的估计方案的扩展，涵盖了更通用的满足一定连续性准则的风险度量，例如谱风险度量和基于效用的缺口风险度量。据我们所知，我们的工作是第一个在马尔可夫设置中为任何风险度量提供估计误差的下界和上界的工作。我们指出，我们的下界也可扩展到无限时间折现成本的均值。即使在这种情况下，我们的结果$\\Omega(1/\\sqrt{n})$也优于现有结果$\\Omega(",
