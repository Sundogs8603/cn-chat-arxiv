    "translated_abstract": "从生成预训练变压器（GPT）系列中的各种大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种文本生成任务中取得了卓越的性能。然而，由于高推理延迟，巨大的模型大小阻碍了它们在实际应用中的实用性。因此，通过量化、剪枝和其他方法提高LLMs的效率成为LLM研究的一个关键问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于Hessian敏感度感知混合稀疏化剪枝的方法，可以将LLMs剪枝至至少50%的稀疏性，而无需重新训练。它根据敏感度自适应地分配稀疏性，使我们能够降低剪枝引起的误差，同时保持整体稀疏性水平。当稀疏度非常高时，所提出的方法的优势更加明显。此外，我们的方法与量化兼容，可以进一步压缩LLMs。",
