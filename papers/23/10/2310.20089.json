    "abstract": "Clinical note classification is a common clinical NLP task. However, annotated data-sets are scarse. Prompt-based learning has recently emerged as an effective method to adapt pre-trained models for text classification using only few training examples. A critical component of prompt design is the definition of the template (i.e. prompt text). The effect of template position, however, has been insufficiently investigated. This seems particularly important in the clinical setting, where task-relevant information is usually sparse in clinical notes. In this study we develop a keyword-optimized template insertion method (KOTI) and show how optimizing position can improve performance on several clinical tasks in a zero-shot and few-shot training setting.",

    "translated_abstract": "临床笔记分类是一项常见的临床自然语言处理任务。然而，带有注释的数据集很少。最近，基于提示式学习已成为一种有效的方法，通过仅使用少量训练样本就可以适应预训练模型进行文本分类。提示设计的关键组成部分是模板（即提示文本）的定义。然而，模板位置的影响尚未得到充分的研究。在临床环境中，这似乎尤为重要，因为临床笔记中的任务相关信息通常很少。在本研究中，我们开发了一种关键词优化模板插入方法（KOTI），并展示了优化位置如何在零射和少射训练设置中改善多个临床任务的性能。",
