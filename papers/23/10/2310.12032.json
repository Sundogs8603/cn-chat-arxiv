    "translated_abstract": "线性共同关联模型（LMC）是一种非常通用的多任务高斯过程模型，用于回归或分类。虽然其表达能力和概念简单性很有吸引力，但朴素实现在数据点数量和任务数量方面具有立方复杂度，使得对大多数应用来说，必须进行近似处理。然而，最近的研究表明，在某些条件下，该模型的潜在过程可以解耦，导致仅与所述过程数量呈线性复杂度。我们在这里扩展了这些结果，从最一般的假设中展示了在LMC的高效精确计算所需的唯一条件是对噪声模型进行温和假设。我们引入了结果的完整参数化“投影LMC”模型，并给出了边缘似然函数的表达式，以实现高效的优化。我们对合成数据进行了参数研究，展示了我们方法相对于未经处理的方法的优异性能。",
