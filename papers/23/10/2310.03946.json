    "translated_abstract": "通过计算方法准确筛选候选药物配体与靶蛋白的结合是药物开发的主要关注点，因为筛选潜在候选物能够节省找药物的时间和费用。这种虚拟筛选部分依赖于预测配体和蛋白质之间的结合亲和力的方法。鉴于存在许多计算模型对不同目标的结合亲和力预测结果不同，我们在这里开发了一个元模型框架，通过整合已发表的基于结构的对接和基于序列的深度学习模型来构建。在构建这个框架时，我们评估了许多组合的个别模型、训练数据库以及线性和非线性的元模型方法。我们显示出许多元模型在亲和力预测上显著改善了个别基础模型的性能。我们最好的元模型达到了与最先进的纯结构为基础的深度学习工具相当的性能。总体而言，我们证明了这个元模型框架可以显著改善配体-蛋白质结合亲和力预测的性能。",
