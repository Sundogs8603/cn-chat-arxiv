In LiLAS, we open up two academic search platforms to allow participating research to evaluate their systems in a Docker-based research environment. This overview paper describes the motivation, infrastructure, and two systems LIVIVO and GESIS Search that are part of this CLEF lab.",

    "translated_abstract": "学术搜索是信息检索领域多年来一直面临的挑战。即使在今天，寻找学术资料仍然是一个广泛的研究领域，最近开始致力于解决像COVID-19大流行这样的问题。然而，测试集和专门的数据集如CORD-19只能进行系统导向的实验，而在真实环境中评估算法的机会只对来自工业界的研究人员开放。在LiLAS中，我们开放了两个学术搜索平台，以便参与研究者能够在基于Docker的研究环境中评估他们的系统。这篇综述论文描述了动机、基础设施和两个系统LIVIVO和GESIS Search，它们是CLEF实验室的一部分。",
