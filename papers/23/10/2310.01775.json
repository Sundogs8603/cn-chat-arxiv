    "translated_abstract": "许多操作任务，如使用工具或装配零件，往往需要符号和几何推理。任务和运动规划（TAMP）算法通常通过对高级任务序列进行树搜索并检查运动学和动力学可行性来解决这些问题。虽然性能良好，但大多数现有算法的效率非常低，因为其时间复杂性随可能动作和物体数量的增加呈指数增长。此外，它们只能找到单个解决方案，而可能存在许多可行的计划。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一种名为Stein任务和运动规划（STAMP）的新算法，它利用并行化和可微仿真来高效地搜索多个多样化的计划。STAMP将离散和连续的TAMP问题转化为可以使用变分推断解决的连续优化问题。我们的算法基于Stein变分梯度下降，一种概率推断方法。",
