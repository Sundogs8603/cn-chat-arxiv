    "translated_abstract": "尽管深度神经网络在图像和文本方面有着 extensive的研究，但是在关系数据库（RDBs）方面的深度学习仍然是一个相对未开发的领域。最近流行的一个方向是将图神经网络（GNNs）应用于RBDs。然而，在大规模的关系数据库上训练GNNs效率较低，主要是因为需要多轮训练和潜在的大而低效的表示。因此，在本文中，我们提出了SPARE（Single-Pass Relational models），一种可以在关系数据库上高效训练并且提供与GNNs相似准确度的新型神经模型。为了实现高效训练，与GNNs不同，SPARE利用了关系数据库中数据的规则结构，可以在单遍训练时利用对称性。我们的大量实证评估证明，SPARE可以显著加快训练和推理的速度，同时提供相似的准确度。",
