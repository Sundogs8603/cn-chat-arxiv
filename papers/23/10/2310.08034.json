    "translated_abstract": "人本设计与人工智能能力的融合为超越交通的下一代自动驾驶车辆开辟了新的可能性。这些车辆可以与乘客动态互动并根据其喜好进行自适应。本文提出了一种新颖的框架，利用大型语言模型（LLM）来增强自动驾驶车辆的决策过程。通过利用LLM的语言和上下文理解能力以及专门的工具，我们旨在将LLM的语言和推理能力整合到自动驾驶车辆中。我们的研究包括在HighwayEnv中进行实验，这是一套用于自动驾驶和战术决策任务的环境集，以探索LLM在各种场景中的解释、互动和推理。我们还研究了实时个性化，展示了LLM如何根据口头命令影响驾驶行为。我们的实证结果强调了LLM在自动驾驶车辆中的显著优势。",
