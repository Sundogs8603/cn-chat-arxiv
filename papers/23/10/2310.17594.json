    "translated_abstract": "无监督领域自适应（UDA）是机器学习中一种重要的形式，它可以将领域内的模型扩展到数据分布不同的目标领域。大多数先前的工作都关注于捕捉跨领域可传递性，但往往忽视了丰富的领域内结构，这在实践中导致了更差的可区分性。本文提出了一种新颖的图谱对齐框架（SPA）来解决这一权衡问题。我们的方法的核心概要如下：（i）通过将DA问题转化为图原语，SPA将粗粒度的图对齐机制与一种新颖的谱正则化器相结合，以在特征空间中对齐领域图；（ii）我们进一步开发了一种细粒度的消息传递模块，基于一种新颖的邻域感知自训练机制，在目标领域中提高了可区分性。在标准基准测试中，SPA的广泛实验表明其性能已超过现有方法。",
