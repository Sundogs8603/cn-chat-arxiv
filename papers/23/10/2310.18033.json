    "abstract": "Using data from 35 Participatory Budgeting instances in Amsterdam, we empirically compare two different Participatory Budgeting rules: the greedy cost welfare rule and the Method of Equal Shares. We quantify how proportional, equal and fair the rules are and conclude that, for a small price in total voter satisfaction, the Method of Equal Shares performs better on all notions of fairness studied. We further provide a popular and a visual explanation of the Method of Equal Shares.",

    "translated_abstract": "通过使用阿姆斯特丹35个参与性预算实例的数据，我们实证比较了两种不同的参与性预算规则：贪婪成本福利规则和平等份额方法。我们量化了这些规则在比例、平等和公平性概念上的表现，并得出结论，尽管在总体选民满意度上付出较小代价，平等份额方法在所有研究的公平概念上表现更好。此外，我们进一步提供了平等份额方法的流行和可视化解释。",
