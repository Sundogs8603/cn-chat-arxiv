    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个理论框架，用于分析高维情况下低密度分离假设下的半监督分类。具体而言，我们引入了QLDS，一个线性分类模型，其中通过二次边界最大化来实现低密度分离假设。该算法具有明确的解和丰富的理论属性，并且我们证明了我们算法的特殊情况是监督情况下的最小二乘支持向量机，完全无监督情况下的谱聚类，以及一类半监督的基于图的方法。因此，QLDS在这些监督和无监督学习方法之间建立了一个平滑的桥梁。利用随机矩阵理论的最新进展，我们正式推导了在渐近情况下的分类误差的理论评估。作为一个应用，我们推导出了一种超参数选择策略，以找到最佳的监督和无监督之间的平衡。",
