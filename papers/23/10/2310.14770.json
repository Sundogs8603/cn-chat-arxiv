In this paper, we analyze the score-based formulation of learning with abstention in the multi-class classification setting. We introduce new families of surrogate losses for the abstention loss function, which include the state-of-the-art surrogate losses in the single-stage setting and a novel family of loss functions in the two-stage setting. We prove strong non-asymptotic and hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees for these surrogate losses, which upper-bound the estimation error of the abstention loss function in terms of the estimation error of the surrogate loss. Our bounds can help compare different score-based surrogates and guide the design of novel abstention algorithms by minimizing the proposed surrogate losses. We experimentally evaluate our new algorithms on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets and the practical significance of our new surrogate losse",

    "translated_abstract": "学习中的放弃是一种重要的场景，学习者可以选择在某个代价下放弃进行预测。本文在多类别分类的设置下分析了基于分数的学习中的放弃。我们引入了放弃损失函数的新代理损失族群，其中包括单阶段设置中最先进的代理损失以及二阶段设置中的新型损失函数。我们证明了这些代理损失的强非渐近和假设集特定的一致性保证，这些保证上界了放弃损失函数的估计误差，与代理损失的估计误差相关。我们的上界可以帮助比较不同的基于分数的代理损失，指导通过最小化提出的代理损失函数来设计新的放弃算法。我们在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和SVHN数据集上对我们的新算法进行了实验评估，展示了我们的新代理损失函数的实际意义。",
