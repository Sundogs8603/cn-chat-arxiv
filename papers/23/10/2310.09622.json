    "translated_abstract": "加密货币，尤其是比特币，容易出现剧烈波动，导致价格频繁跳跃，因此历来受到交易员投机的青睐。对这些波动的更好理解可以让加密货币投资者通过做出明智的决策获益。最近的文献声称比特币的价格受到关于比特币系统的情绪影响。交易量以及比特币的流行度显示出作为比特币价格潜在驱动因素的正面证据。本研究考虑了一个描述比特币价格动态和影响价格的谷歌搜索数量的双变量跳跃扩散模型，作为情绪指示器。我们得到了比特币价格的闭合公式，并推导了比特币期权的Black-Scholes方程。我们首先通过引入人工神经网络和多层感知器技术解决了相应的比特币期权偏微分方程来定价过程。",
