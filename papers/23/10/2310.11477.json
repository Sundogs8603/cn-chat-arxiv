    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of motor bearing fault detection (MBFD), which involves the task of identifying faults in a motor bearing based on its vibration. To this end, we first propose and evaluate various machine learning based systems for the MBFD task. Furthermore, we propose three deep learning based systems for the MBFD task, each of which explores one of the following training strategies: supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. The proposed machine learning based systems and deep learning based systems are evaluated, compared, and then they are used to identify the best model for the MBFD task. We conducted extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets of motor bearing faults, including those from the American Society for Mechanical Failure Prevention Technology (MFPT), Case Western Reserve University Bearing Center (CWRU), and the Condition Monitoring of Bearing Damage in Electromechanical Drive Systems from Paderborn U",
