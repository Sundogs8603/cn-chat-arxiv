    "abstract": "Designing products to meet consumers' preferences is essential for a business's success. We propose the Gradient-based Survey (GBS), a discrete choice experiment for multiattribute product design. The experiment elicits consumer preferences through a sequence of paired comparisons for partial profiles. GBS adaptively constructs paired comparison questions based on the respondents' previous choices. Unlike the traditional random utility maximization paradigm, GBS is robust to model misspecification by not requiring a parametric utility model. Cross-pollinating the machine learning and experiment design, GBS is scalable to products with hundreds of attributes and can design personalized products for heterogeneous consumers. We demonstrate the advantage of GBS in accuracy and sample efficiency compared to the existing parametric and nonparametric methods in simulations.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了满足消费者的偏好，设计产品对于企业的成功至关重要。我们提出了基于梯度的调查（GBS），这是一种用于多属性产品设计的离散选择实验。该实验通过一系列针对部分配置进行的配对比较来获取消费者的偏好。GBS根据受访者的先前选择自适应地构建配对比较问题。与传统的随机效用最大化范式不同，GBS不需要参数化效用模型，因此对模型规范错误具有鲁棒性。通过将机器学习和实验设计相结合，GBS可扩展到具有数百个属性的产品，并且可以为异质消费者设计个性化产品。我们通过模拟实验证明了GBS相比于现有的参数化和非参数化方法在准确性和样本效率方面的优势。",
