    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown the potential to improve relevance and provide direct answers in web searches. However, challenges arise in validating the reliability of generated results and the credibility of contributing sources, due to the limitations of traditional information retrieval algorithms and the LLM hallucination problem. Aiming to create a \"PageRank\" for the LLM era, we strive to transform LLM into a relevant, responsible, and trustworthy searcher. We propose a novel generative retrieval framework leveraging the knowledge of LLMs to foster a direct link between queries and online sources. This framework consists of three core modules: Generator, Validator, and Optimizer, each focusing on generating trustworthy online sources, verifying source reliability, and refining unreliable sources, respectively. Extensive experiments and evaluations highlight our method's superior relevance, responsibility, and trustfulness against various SOTA methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现已经显示出它在提高搜索相关性和提供直接答案方面的潜力。然而，由于传统信息检索算法的局限性和LLM的错觉问题，验证生成结果的可靠性和贡献来源的可信度是一个挑战。为了创建LLM时代的“PageRank”，我们致力于将LLM转变为一个相关、负责任且可信赖的搜索器。我们提出了一个新颖的生成检索框架，利用LLM的知识建立查询和在线来源之间的直接链接。该框架包括三个核心模块：生成器、验证器和优化器，分别专注于生成可信赖的在线来源、验证来源的可靠性和优化不可信赖的来源。广泛的实验证明了我们方法在相关性、负责任性和可信度方面相对于各种SOTA方法的优势。",
