    "translated_abstract": "理论和实践都支持一个关键挑战，即稳健性要求比标准训练更大的网络容量和更多的数据。然而，在严格的Lipschitz约束下有效地增加容量比看起来更困难，这表明现有的方法更倾向于低拟合而不是过拟合。此外，我们主张对基于Lipshitz的方法的设计空间进行仔细探索不足，这会导致潜在的性能提升被忽视。在这项工作中，我们通过使用一系列新技术、设计优化和综合以前的研究，更全面地评估Lipschitz-based认证方法的潜力。我们能够显著提高确定性认证在各种基准数据集上的“验证稳健准确性”（VRA），并覆盖一系列扰动大小。特别值得注意的是，我们发现...",
