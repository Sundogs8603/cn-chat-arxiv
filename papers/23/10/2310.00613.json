    "title": "Review on Decarbonizing the Transportation Sector in China: Overview, Analysis, and Perspectives. (arXiv:2310.00613v1 [econ.GN])",
    "abstract": "This review identifies challenges and effective strategies to decarbonize China's rapidly growing transportation sector, currently the third largest carbon emitter, considering China's commitment to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Key challenges include rising travel demand, unreached peak car ownership, declining bus ridership, gaps between energy technology research and practical application, and limited institutional capacity for decarbonization. This review categorizes current decarbonization measures, strategies, and policies in China's transportation sector using the \"Avoid, Shift, Improve\" framework, complemented by a novel strategic vector of \"Institutional Capacity & Technology Development\" to capture broader development perspectives. This comprehensive analysis aims to facilitate informed decision-making and promote collaborative strategies for China's transition to a sustainable transportation future.",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇综述识别出了脱碳中国快速增长的交通部门所面临的挑战和有效策略，该部门是目前第三大碳排放源，考虑到中国承诺在2030年前达到碳排放峰值并在2060年实现碳中和。主要挑战包括不断增长的出行需求、未达到汽车拥有高峰、公交乘客量下降、能源技术研究与实际应用之间的差距，以及脱碳的有限机构能力。这篇综述使用“避免、转移、改进”框架对中国交通部门目前的脱碳措施、策略和政策进行分类，辅以“机构能力与技术发展”的新战略矢量以获取更广泛的发展视角。这种综合分析旨在促进明智的决策和促进中国向可持续交通未来的过渡。",
