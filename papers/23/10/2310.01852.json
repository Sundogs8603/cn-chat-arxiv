    "translated_abstract": "视频-语言（VL）预训练在多个下游任务中取得了显著的进展。然而，当前的VL预训练框架难以将其扩展到除视觉和语言之外的多模态（N模态，N>=3）。因此，我们提出了LanguageBind，通过将语言作为不同模态之间的纽带，因为语言模态已经得到了很好的探索，包含丰富的语义信息。具体而言，我们使用VL预训练获取的语言编码器，并通过对比学习训练其他模态的编码器。结果是，所有模态被映射到一个共享的特征空间中，实现了多模态的语义对齐。虽然LanguageBind可以扩展VL模态到N模态，但我们还需要一个带有以语言为中心的对齐数据对的高质量数据集。因此，我们提出了VIDAL-10M，其中包含了视频、红外、深度、音频及其相应的语言数据，命名为VIDAL-10M。",
