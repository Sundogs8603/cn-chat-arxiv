Toward this end, methods for submodular maximization via sequential greedy planning can be used for scalable optimization of camera views across teams of robots but face challenges with efficient coordination in cluttered environments. Obstacles can produce occlusions and increase chances of inter-robot collision which can violate requirements for near-optimality guarantees. To coordinate teams of aerial robots in filming groups of people in dense environments, a more general view-planning approach is required. We explore how collision and occlusion impact performance in filming applications through the development of a multi-robot multi-actor view planner with an occlusion-aware objective for filming groups of people and compare with a greedy formation planner.

    "translated_abstract": "无人机团队的部署可以在复杂环境中拍摄动态人群（演员）的大规模影像，用于团队运动和电影制作等新应用领域。为了实现该目标，可以使用通过顺序贪心规划进行子模最大化的方法，以便在无人机团队之间进行摄像机视野的可扩展优化，但在杂乱环境中协同效果面临挑战。障碍物可能产生遮挡并增加无人机碰撞的几率，这可能违反近似最优性的要求。为了在稠密环境中协调无人机团队拍摄人群，需要一种更通用的视角规划方法。我们通过开发一个具有遮挡感知目标的多无人机多演员视角规划器，并与贪心形成规划器进行比较，探讨遮挡和碰撞对拍摄应用性能的影响。为了评估性能，",
