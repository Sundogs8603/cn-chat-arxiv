However, causal discovery in GRNs is a challenging problem for multiple reasons including the existence of cyclic feedback loops and uncertainty that yields diverse possible causal structures.

We introduce Swift-DynGFN as a novel framework that enhances causal structure learning in GRNs while addressing scalability concerns.

    "translated_abstract": "理解基因调控网络（GRNs）内的因果关系对于揭示细胞过程中的基因相互作用至关重要。然而，GRNs中的因果发现是一个具有挑战性的问题，原因有多种，包括存在循环反馈环路和产生多样性可能的因果结构的不确定性。以前在这个领域的工作要么忽略了循环动力学（假设非循环结构），要么在可扩展性方面有困难。我们引入了Swift-DynGFN作为一种新颖的框架，它增强了GRNs中因果结构的学习，并解决了可扩展性问题。具体而言，Swift-DynGFN利用基因独立性来提高并行性和降低计算成本。在真实的单细胞RNA速度和合成GRN数据集上的实验展示了在学习GRNs中因果结构和大规模系统的可扩展性方面的进展。",
