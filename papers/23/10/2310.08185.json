    "translated_abstract": "计划与写作是长篇叙事文本生成中常用的层次化方法，首先创建一个计划来指导叙事写作。遵循这种方法，一些研究仅仅依靠对大型语言模型进行提示进行计划，这经常产生次优的结果。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的框架，称为评估引导迭代计划提取方法（EIPE-text）用于长篇叙事文本生成，该方法从叙事语料库中提取计划并利用提取的计划构建更好的规划器。EIPE-text有三个阶段：计划提取、学习和推理。在计划提取阶段，它迭代地从叙事语料库中提取和改进计划，并构建一个计划语料库。我们提出了一种基于问答（QA）的评估机制，自动评估计划并生成详细的计划改进指示，以引导迭代改进。在学习阶段，我们通过微调构建一个更好的规划器。",
