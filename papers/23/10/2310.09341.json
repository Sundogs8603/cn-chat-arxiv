    "abstract": "The initial interaction of a user with a recommender system is problematic because, in such a so-called cold start situation, the recommender system has very little information about the user, if any. Moreover, in collaborative filtering, users need to share their preferences with the service provider by rating items while in content-based filtering there is no need for such information sharing. We have recently shown that a content-based model that uses hypercube graphs can determine user preferences with a very limited number of ratings while better preserving user privacy. In this paper, we confirm these findings on the basis of experiments with more than 1,000 users in the restaurant and movie domains. We show that the proposed method outperforms standard machine learning algorithms when the number of available ratings is at most 10, which often happens, and is competitive with larger training sets. In addition, training is simple and does not require large computational efforts.",

    "translated_abstract": "用户与推荐系统的初始互动存在问题，因为在这种所谓的冷启动情况下，推荐系统对用户的信息了解非常有限，甚至没有任何信息。此外，在协同过滤中，用户需要通过评价物品与服务提供者共享自己的偏好，而在基于内容的过滤中则不需要这样的信息共享。我们最近发现使用超立方图的基于内容的模型可以在非常有限的评分数量下确定用户的偏好，同时更好地保护用户的隐私。在本文中，我们通过对餐馆和电影领域超过1000名用户进行的实验验证了这些发现。我们表明，所提出的方法在可用评分数量不超过10时优于标准机器学习算法，并在较大的训练集中具有竞争力。此外，训练简单且不需要大量计算工作量。",
