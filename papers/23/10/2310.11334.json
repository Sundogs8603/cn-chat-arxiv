    "translated_title": "代理特定效应：多智能体MDPs中的因果效应传播分析",
    "translated_abstract": "在多智能体决策中建立行动与结果之间的因果关系对于负有责任的决策是至关重要的。然而，解释和量化代理对这种关系的贡献面临着重大挑战。在多智能体序贯决策的背景下，这些挑战尤为突出，因为代理的行动对结果的因果效应取决于其他代理如何对该行动作出响应。本文的目标是提出一个系统性的方法，将代理的行动对其他代理产生的因果效应归因到其所施加的影响上。针对多智能体马尔可夫决策过程，我们引入了一种新的因果数量——代理特定效应（ASE），用于衡量代理行动对通过其他代理传播的结果的影响。然后，我们转向ASE的反事实对应物（cf-ASE），提供了识别cf-ASE的一组充分条件，并提出了一种实用的基于采样的算法。",
