    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型（DMs）是用于连续输入的最先进的生成模型。DMs通过在输入空间（即位置空间）中构建随机微分方程（SDE），并使用神经网络进行反演来工作。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一种基于相位空间动力学的新型生成建模框架，其中相位空间被定义为一个包括位置和速度的增强空间。利用随机最优控制的洞察力，我们构建了相位空间中的路径测度，实现了高效的采样。与DMs相比，我们的框架在动力传播的早期阶段就能够生成逼真的数据点。这种早期预测为通过沿轨迹利用额外的速度信息实现高效的数据生成奠定了基础。在标准图像生成基准测试中，我们的模型在小函数评估数量的范围内表现出优秀的性能。",
