    "translated_abstract": "理解句子的含义并适时更新信息状态，即我们所称的\"情景理解\"（SU），对于类似ChatGPT的聊天模型来说是一种关键的人工智能能力。SU对于聊天模型特别重要，可以实现人机之间的一致、连贯和有效的对话。先前的研究已经确定了非聊天机器人大型语言模型（LLMs）存在某些SU限制，但对这些限制的程度和原因尚不了解，并且当前聊天模型在这一领域的能力尚未得到探索。本研究解决了这些问题，提出了一种新颖的用于测试聊天导向模型SU的合成环境，通过评估模型跟踪和列举环境状态的能力，实现对SU的受控和系统化测试。我们的环境还允许对模型性能动态进行深入分析，以更好地理解性能模式的根本原因。",
