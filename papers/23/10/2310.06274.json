    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在遗赠动机随年龄变化的情况下购买保险，以及寿险和生活年金都需要支付费用的情况。现有的生命周期文献假设遗赠是正常的商品，既不是必需品也不是奢侈品。很多文献还隐含地假设寿险费用为负值。文献的一个重要发现是，对寿险的需求和对生活年金的需求是对称的。在有费用的情况下，在整个人生阶段购买寿险是最优的选择。生活年金的阶段直接接在寿险的阶段之后。我们发现，在同时对这两种产品收取正费用的现实情况下，中年和最大年龄相邻处可能会出现最多两个不参与的阶段。我们强调了在抚养孩子年纪的必需遗赠和之后的奢侈遗赠的例子。这些假设的集合解释了为什么在抚养孩子年纪存在大量对寿险的需求。",
    "tldr": "在考虑了年龄变化的遗赠动机和有费用的寿险与生活年金的情况下，研究发现持续购买生命保险是最优选择，尽管存在费用。同时存在必需遗赠和奢侈遗赠的情况下，在中年和最大年龄相邻处可能出现不参与的阶段。",
    "en_tdlr": "The study investigates the optimal insurance purchases considering age-varying bequest motives and loads on life insurance and life annuities. The research reveals that continuous purchase of life insurance is optimal throughout life, even with loads. It also suggests the possibility of periods of non-participation at midlife and near the maximum age, especially when there are necessity bequests during child-rearing years and luxury bequests thereafter."
