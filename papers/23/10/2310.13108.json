    "translated_abstract": "脑肿瘤的发病率不断增加，其特征是异常组织在大脑中的不受控制扩散，全球每年几乎有70万新病例被诊断出来。磁共振成像（MRI）常常用于脑肿瘤的诊断，准确的分类是关键的临床程序。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种使用自定义迁移学习网络对MRI图像中的脑肿瘤进行分类的高效解决方案。虽然一些研究人员采用了各种预训练的架构，如RESNET-50，ALEXNET，VGG-16和VGG-19，但这些方法通常存在高计算复杂性的问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个自定义的轻量级模型，使用了基于卷积神经网络的预训练架构以减少复杂性。具体而言，我们采用了VGG-19架构，并增加了额外的隐藏层，这减少了基础架构的复杂性但提高了计算效率。我们的目标是实现高准确率的脑肿瘤分类同时降低计算复杂性。",
