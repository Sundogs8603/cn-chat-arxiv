    "abstract": "Discrete-choice models, such as Multinomial Logit, Probit, or Mixed-Logit, are widely used in Marketing, Economics, and Operations Research: given a set of alternatives, the customer is modeled as choosing one of the alternatives to maximize a (latent) utility function.

While one can construct reasonable models of the customer's behavior, estimating such models becomes very challenging because of the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible subsets of items. In this paper we develop a transformer neural network architecture, the Transformer Choice Net, that is suitable for predicting multiple choices. Transformer networks turn out to be especially suitable for this task as they take into account not only the features of the customer and the items but also the context, which in this case could be the assortment as well as the custom",

    "translated_abstract": "在市场营销、经济学和运筹学中，离散选择模型，如多项式逻辑模型、Probit模型或混合逻辑模型广泛使用：给定一组可选项，顾客被模拟为选择其中之一以最大化（潜在的）效用函数。然而，将这些模型推广到顾客选择多个项目的情况（如电子商务购物）却存在问题。虽然可以建立合理的顾客行为模型，但由于项目子集的组合爆炸，对于这些模型的估计变得非常具有挑战性。在本文中，我们开发了一种有助于预测多个选择的Transformer神经网络架构，即Transformer Choice Net。事实证明，Transformer网络对于这个任务特别适用，因为它们不仅考虑了顾客和项目的特征，还考虑了上下文，即可选项的范围以及定制化需求。",
