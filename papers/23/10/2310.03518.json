    "translated_abstract": "在实际对话场景中，由于话语中存在未知的输入噪声，现有的监督式槽填充模型在实际应用中的表现通常较差。虽然有一些关于噪声鲁棒性模型的研究，但这些研究只在基于规则的合成数据集上进行评估，这种限制性导致了噪声鲁棒方法研究的推广困难。本文引入了一个名为Noise-SF的噪声鲁棒性评估数据集，该数据集包含五种类型的人工标注噪声，并且所有这些噪声都确实存在于真实的大规模鲁棒性训练方法中。通过对Noise-SF进行了详尽的实证评估实验，我们发现基线模型在鲁棒性评估中表现较差，而所提出的框架可以有效提高模型的鲁棒性。基于实证实验结果，我们提出了一些前瞻性的建议来推动该领域的研究。",
