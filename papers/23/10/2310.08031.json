    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习问题中，对于带有额外节点信息（如文本、图像或标签）的图形的增加兴趣，促使了需要耗费大量资源处理整个图形的方法的流行。然而，对于从这样的数据中提取有用信息的快速局部方法（即不需要访问整个图形）的发展还很少。为此，我们提出了使用噪声节点标签作为额外节点信息的局部图聚类的研究。在这种设置下，节点根据所属簇的联属关系接收初始二进制标签：如果它们属于目标簇，则为1；否则为0。随后，这些标签的一部分会被翻转。我们研究了将噪声标签纳入局部图聚类的好处。通过构建带有这些标签的加权图形，我们研究了基于图扩散的局部聚类方法在原始图形和加权图形上的性能。从理论角度出发，",
