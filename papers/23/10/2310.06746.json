    "translated_abstract": "解释性是利用机器学习方法估计异质治疗效应时的关键问题，特别是对于医疗应用来说，常常需要做出高风险决策。受到解释性的预测性、描述性、相关性框架的启发，我们提出了因果规则学习，该方法通过找到描述潜在子群的精细因果规则集来估计和增强我们对异质治疗效应的理解。因果规则学习包括三个阶段：规则发现、规则选择和规则分析。在规则发现阶段，我们利用因果森林生成一组具有相应子群平均治疗效应的因果规则池。选择阶段使用D-学习方法从这些规则中选择子集，将个体水平的治疗效应作为子群水平效应的线性组合进行解构。这有助于回答之前文献忽视的问题：如果一个个体同时属于多个不同的治疗子群，会怎么样呢？",
