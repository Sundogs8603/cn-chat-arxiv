    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive inferential capabilities, with numerous research endeavors devoted to enhancing this capacity through prompting. Despite these efforts, a unified epistemological foundation is still conspicuously absent. Drawing inspiration from Kant's a priori philosophy, we propose the UPAR prompting framework, designed to emulate the structure of human cognition within LLMs. The UPAR framework is delineated into four phases: \"Understand\", \"Plan\", \"Act\", and \"Reflect\", enabling the extraction of structured information from complex contexts, prior planning of solutions, execution according to plan, and self-reflection. This structure significantly augments the explainability and accuracy of LLM inference, producing a human-understandable and inspectable inferential trajectory. Furthermore, our work offers an epistemological foundation for existing prompting techniques, allowing for a possible systematic integration of these methods. With GPT-4,",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)展示了令人印象深刻的推理能力，许多研究致力于通过提示提升这种能力。尽管有这些努力，统一的认识论基础仍然明显缺失。受康德的先验哲学启发，我们提出了UPAR提示框架，旨在在LLMs中模拟人类认知结构。UPAR框架分为四个阶段：“理解”、“计划”、“行动”和“反思”，使得能够从复杂背景中提取结构化信息，事先规划解决方案，按计划执行，并进行自我反思。这个结构显著增强了LLM推理的可解释性和准确性，产生了人类可理解和可检查的推理轨迹。此外，我们的工作为现有的提示技术提供了认识论基础，可能实现这些方法的系统集成。",
