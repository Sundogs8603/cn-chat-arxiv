    "translated_abstract": "标签噪声是大型数据集中常见的挑战，它会显著降低深度神经网络的泛化能力。大部分现有研究都集中在计算机视觉中的噪声标签，然而，图模型将节点特征和图拓扑结构作为输入，通过消息传递机制更容易受到标签噪声的影响。近期，只有少数几篇文章提出了解决图中标签噪声的方法。其中一个主要限制是它们假设图是同构的，并且标签是平滑分布的。然而，现实世界中的图可能包含不同程度的异质性甚至是异质性的主导，导致当前方法的不足。本文研究任意异质性条件下的图标签噪声问题，旨在纠正噪声标签并为之前未标记的节点分配标签。我们首先进行了两个实证分析，探讨图同质性对图标签噪声的影响。接着，我们提出了一种基于标签传播的算法来处理任意异质性的图标签噪声。",
