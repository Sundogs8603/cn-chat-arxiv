    "translated_abstract": "监测排球运动员在训练或比赛中的跳跃次数对防止伤害非常重要，然而使用传统方法如视频分析来进行测量需要很大的工作量和成本。此外，现有方法无法准确区分不同类型的跳跃。本研究提出了一种使用单个腰部惯性测量单元（IMU）识别排球跳跃类型的无障碍系统。多层时态卷积网络（MS-TCN）被应用于逐样本分类。该模型在十名和二十六名排球运动员中进行了评估，在固定协议的跳跃和着地任务的实验室会话期间以及四个排球训练期间进行了评估。相比于最先进的深度学习模型，MS-TCN模型在性能上表现更好，但计算成本更低。在实验室会话期间，大多数跳跃次数之间的差异很小。",
