This includes many useful applications, such as text simplification, paraphrase generation, style transfer, etc. In contrast to text summarization and open-ended text completion (e.g., story), the text-to-text generation tasks we discuss in this tutorial are more constrained in terms of semantic consistency and targeted language styles. This level of control makes these tasks ideal testbeds for studying the ability of models to generate text that is both semantically adequate and stylistically appropriate. Moreover, these tasks are interesting from a technical standpoint, as they require complex combinations of lexical and syntactical transformations,",

    "translated_abstract": "在本教程中，我们专注于文本到文本生成，一类自然语言生成（NLG）任务，它以一段文本作为输入，然后生成一个按照特定标准改进的修订版（例如可读性或语言风格），同时在很大程度上保留原文的含义和长度。这包括许多有用的应用，如文本简化、改写生成、风格转移等。与文本摘要和开放式文本完成（例如故事）相比，我们在本教程中讨论的文本到文本生成任务在语义一致性和目标语言风格方面更加约束。这种控制水平使得这些任务成为研究模型生成既语义恰当又符合风格要求的文本能力的理想试验台。此外，从技术角度来看，这些任务很有趣，因为它们需要复杂的词汇和句法转换的组合。",
