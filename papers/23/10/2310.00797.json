    "translated_abstract": "异常检测（AD）是一项重要任务，涉及识别不符合已学习的正常模型的观察结果。之前的深度AD工作主要基于熟悉性假设，在预训练的嵌入空间中使用熟悉特征作为参考。虽然这种策略已被证明非常成功，但实际上，在异常包含未被预训练编码很好捕捉到的全新特征时，它会导致持续的假阴性。我们提出了一种新颖的AD方法，利用可解释性在输入空间中捕捉新颖特征作为未解释的观察结果。通过在混合方法中结合相似性和新颖性，我们在广泛的异常基准测试中取得了很强的性能。我们的方法在多个基准测试中建立了新的最新技术，处理多样化的异常类型，同时消除了昂贵的背景模型和密集匹配的需求。特别地，我们展示了通过考虑新颖特征，我们的方法能够解决先前的假阴性问题。",
