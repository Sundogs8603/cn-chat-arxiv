    "translated_abstract": "本文中，我们提出了两个我们最近进行的研究的例子，应用机器学习神经网络对外行星任务的图像数据集进行特征识别。我们的第一个研究是在木卫二的混乱区域中识别冰块（也被称为漂浮块、板块、多边形）。我们采用了迁移学习的方法，对行业标准的Mask R-CNN（基于区域的卷积神经网络）添加和训练新的层次，以识别训练数据集中标记的块。随后，更新后的模型被测试于新的数据集，实现了68%的精度。在不同的应用中，我们将Mask R-CNN应用于泰坦上云的识别，同样通过更新的训练和对新数据的测试，获得了369幅图像上95%的精度。我们评估了我们的技术相对成功的程度，并提出了如何进一步改进训练和识别的建议。我们使用了新的方法来处理行星科学数据集，通过机器学习算法进行特征提取和分类。",
