    "abstract": "Personalization of playlists is a common feature in music streaming services, but conventional techniques, such as collaborative filtering, rely on explicit assumptions regarding content quality to learn how to make recommendations. Such assumptions often result in misalignment between offline model objectives and online user satisfaction metrics. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework that solves for such limitations by directly optimizing for user satisfaction metrics via the use of a simulated playlist-generation environment. Using this simulator we develop and train a modified Deep Q-Network, the action head DQN (AH-DQN), in a manner that addresses the challenges imposed by the large state and action space of our RL formulation. The resulting policy is capable of making recommendations from large and dynamic sets of candidate items with the expectation of maximizing consumption metrics. We analyze and evaluate agents offline via simulations that use environmen",

    "translated_abstract": "个性化音乐播放列表是音乐流媒体服务中常见的功能，但传统的技术，如协同过滤，依赖于对内容质量的明确假设，以学习如何进行推荐。这些假设往往导致离线模型目标和在线用户满意度指标之间的不一致。在本文中，我们提出了一个强化学习框架，通过使用模拟的播放列表生成环境直接优化用户满意度指标，解决了这些限制。我们使用这个模拟器开发和训练了一个修改版的深度Q网络，称为AH-DQN，在处理我们的强化学习问题的大状态和动作空间时能够解决挑战。由此产生的策略能够从大型和动态的候选项目集中进行推荐，以最大化消费指标。我们通过使用环境模拟进行离线评估和分析代理。",
