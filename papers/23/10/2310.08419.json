    "abstract": "There is growing interest in ensuring that large language models (LLMs) align with human values. However, the alignment of such models is vulnerable to adversarial jailbreaks, which coax LLMs into overriding their safety guardrails. The identification of these vulnerabilities is therefore instrumental in understanding inherent weaknesses and preventing future misuse. To this end, we propose Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR), an algorithm that generates semantic jailbreaks with only black-box access to an LLM. PAIR -- which is inspired by social engineering attacks -- uses an attacker LLM to automatically generate jailbreaks for a separate targeted LLM without human intervention. In this way, the attacker LLM iteratively queries the target LLM to update and refine a candidate jailbreak. Empirically, PAIR often requires fewer than twenty queries to produce a jailbreak, which is orders of magnitude more efficient than existing algorithms. PAIR also achieves competitive jailbrea",

    "translated_abstract": "大语言模型（LLMs）与人类价值的一致性越来越受关注。然而，这类模型的一致性容易受到对抗性破解的影响，从而迫使LLMs超越其安全防护措施。因此，识别这些漏洞对于理解固有弱点并防止未来的不当使用至关重要。为此，我们提出了Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement（PAIR），这是一种仅通过对LLM进行黑盒访问的算法生成语义破解。PAIR受到社会工程攻击的启发，使用攻击者LLM自动生成针对目标LLM的破解，无需人工干预。攻击者LLM通过迭代查询目标LLM来更新和改进候选破解。在实证上，PAIR通常只需要少于二十个查询来生成破解，这比现有算法高效数个数量级。PAIR还实现了有竞争力的破解效果。",
