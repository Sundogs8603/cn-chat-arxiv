    "abstract": "Reports of human-like behaviors in foundation models are growing, with psychological theories providing enduring tools to investigate these behaviors. However, current research tends to directly apply these human-oriented tools without verifying the faithfulness of their outcomes. In this paper, we introduce a framework, RealBehavior, which is designed to characterize the humanoid behaviors of models faithfully. Beyond simply measuring behaviors, our framework assesses the faithfulness of results based on reproducibility, internal and external consistency, and generalizability. Our findings suggest that a simple application of psychological tools cannot faithfully characterize all human-like behaviors. Moreover, we discuss the impacts of aligning models with human and social values, arguing for the necessity of diversifying alignment objectives to prevent the creation of models with restricted characteristics.",

    "translated_abstract": "基础模型中出现人类化行为的报道与日俱增，心理学理论为研究这些行为提供了持久的工具。然而，当前的研究往往直接应用这些面向人类的工具，而没有验证其结果的准确性。在本文中，我们介绍了一个名为RealBehavior的框架，旨在准确描绘模型的人类化行为。除了简单测量行为外，我们的框架还根据可重现性、内外一致性和泛化性评估结果的准确性。我们的研究结果表明，简单应用心理学工具无法准确描绘所有的人类化行为。此外，我们讨论了将模型与人类和社会价值对齐的影响，并提出了多样化对齐目标的必要性，以防止创建具有受限特征的模型。",
