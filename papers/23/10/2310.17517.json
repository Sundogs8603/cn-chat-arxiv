An action is safer than another if the set of beliefs at which the decision-maker prefers the safer action increases in size (in the set inclusion sense) as the decision-maker becomes more risk averse. We provide a full characterization of this relation and discuss applications to robust belief elicitation, contracting, Bayesian persuasion, game theory, and investment hedging.",
