    "abstract": "Prediction of binding sites for transcription factors is important to understand how they regulate gene expression and how this regulation can be modulated for therapeutic purposes. Although in the past few years there are significant works addressing this issue, there is still space for improvement. In this regard, a transformer based capsule network viz. DNABERT-Cap is proposed in this work to predict transcription factor binding sites mining ChIP-seq datasets. DNABERT-Cap is a bidirectional encoder pre-trained with large number of genomic DNA sequences, empowered with a capsule layer responsible for the final prediction. The proposed model builds a predictor for transcription factor binding sites using the joint optimisation of features encompassing both bidirectional encoder and capsule layer, along with convolutional and bidirectional long-short term memory layers. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed approach, we use a benchmark ChIP-seq datasets of five cell lines viz. A54",

    "translated_abstract": "预测转录因子的结合位点对于理解它们如何调控基因表达以及如何通过治疗手段进行调节非常重要。尽管在过去几年里已经有相当多的工作针对这个问题进行了研究，但仍然有改进的空间。在这方面，本文提出了一种基于Transformer的胶囊网络DNABERT-Cap，用于利用ChIP-seq数据集挖掘预测转录因子结合位点。DNABERT-Cap是一个双向编码器，经过大量基因组DNA序列的预训练，并通过胶囊层进行最终预测。所提出的模型通过对包含双向编码器、胶囊层、卷积和双向长短时记忆层特征的联合优化，构建了转录因子结合位点的预测器。为了评估所提方法的效率，我们使用了五个细胞系的基准ChIP-seq数据集，包括A54。",
