    "abstract": "We present a framework for the automated measurement of responsible AI (RAI) metrics for large language models (LLMs) and associated products and services. Our framework for automatically measuring harms from LLMs builds on existing technical and sociotechnical expertise and leverages the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4. We use this framework to run through several case studies investigating how different LLMs may violate a range of RAI-related principles. The framework may be employed alongside domain-specific sociotechnical expertise to create measurements for new harm areas in the future. By implementing this framework, we aim to enable more advanced harm measurement efforts and further the responsible use of LLMs.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个用于自动化测量大型语言模型（LLMs）及其相关产品和服务的负责任人工智能（RAI）指标的框架。我们基于现有的技术和社会技术专门知识，利用先进的LLMs能力（如GPT-4），建立了自动测量LLMs造成伤害的框架。我们使用该框架通过几个案例研究，调查不同的LLMs如何违反一系列与RAI相关的原则。该框架可与领域特定的社会技术专门知识结合使用，以便在未来创建新的伤害区域的衡量指标。通过实施该框架，我们旨在促进更高级的伤害测量工作，并进一步推动LLMs的责任使用。",
