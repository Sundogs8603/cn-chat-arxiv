    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have made considerable advancements in understanding and generating unstructured text, their application in structured data remains underexplored. Particularly, using LLMs for complex reasoning tasks on knowledge graphs (KGs) remains largely untouched. To address this, we propose KG-GPT, a multi-purpose framework leveraging LLMs for tasks employing KGs. KG-GPT comprises three steps: Sentence Segmentation, Graph Retrieval, and Inference, each aimed at partitioning sentences, retrieving relevant graph components, and deriving logical conclusions, respectively. We evaluate KG-GPT using KG-based fact verification and KGQA benchmarks, with the model showing competitive and robust performance, even outperforming several fully-supervised models. Our work, therefore, marks a significant step in unifying structured and unstructured data processing within the realm of LLMs.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在理解和生成非结构化文本方面取得了可观的进展，但是它们在结构化数据上的应用仍然不够充分。特别是，在知识图谱（KGs）上使用LLMs进行复杂推理任务几乎没有被触及。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了KG-GPT，这是一个多用途框架，利用LLMs来执行涉及KGs的任务。KG-GPT包括三个步骤：句子分割、图检索和推理，每个步骤都旨在将句子分成部分、检索相关的图组件，并得出逻辑结论。我们使用基于KG的事实验证和KGQA基准对KG-GPT进行评估，结果表明该模型具有有竞争力和强健的性能，甚至胜过了几个完全监督的模型。因此，我们的工作在整合结构化和非结构化数据处理方面迈出了重要的一步。",
