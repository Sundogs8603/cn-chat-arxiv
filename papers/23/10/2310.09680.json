    "translated_abstract": "自动语音识别（ASR）受到了广泛的研究关注。最近的突破使得ASR系统在准确转录口语的能力上取得了重要进展，这是构建对话代理的关键进步。然而，准确辨别上下文相关的单词和短语仍然是一项迫切的挑战。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种通过语义格处理来增强ASR系统中上下文识别能力的新方法，利用深度学习模型在准确交付各种词汇和说话风格的转录方面具有出色的能力。我们的解决方案包括使用隐马尔可夫模型和高斯混合模型（HMM-GMM），以及深度神经网络（DNN）模型，将语言建模和声学建模结合起来，以获得更高的准确性。我们通过使用基于transformer的模型来重新评分单词格，使我们的网络具备了非凡的能力。",
