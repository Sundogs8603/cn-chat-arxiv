    "translated_abstract": "最近，深度强化学习（DRL）模型在解决路径规划问题方面展现了良好的结果。然而，大多数DRL求解器通常是用来解决节点路径规划问题，例如旅行推销员问题（TSP）。与此同时，关于应用神经方法来解决弧路径规划问题，例如中国邮递员问题（CPP），的研究却十分有限，因为与TSP相比，它们的解空间通常更加不规则和复杂。为了填补这些空白，本文提出了一个新的DRL框架，来解决带有负载相关成本（CPP-LC）的CPP问题，这是一个具有负载约束的复杂弧路径规划问题。我们方法的创新点有两个。首先，我们将CPP-LC问题形式化为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）顺序模型。随后，我们引入了一种基于DRL的自回归模型，即Arc-DRL模型，它由一个编码器和一个解码器组成，可以有效处理CPP-LC问题。这样的框架使得DRL模型能够高效地工作。",
