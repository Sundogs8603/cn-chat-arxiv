    "translated_abstract": "本文的目标是了解最低工资是否对北马其顿制造业工人的劳动力份额起作用。我们对劳动力份额的变化进行了分解，包括沿着份额-资本曲线的变化、该曲线的移动以及与之偏离的因素。我们使用资本产出比率、全要素生产率和投入品价格来捕捉这些因素，同时引入最低工资作为将曲线偏离的元素。我们使用FE、IV和系统GMM估计器对2012年至2019年期间的20个制造业细分进行面板数据分析。我们发现，最低工资对劳动力份额的作用因行业而异。对于劳动力密集型且工资低的行业，它增加了工人的劳动力份额，表现出资本与劳动之间的互补性。对于资本密集型行业，它减少了劳动力份额，可能是通过失业渠道，表现出劳动力和资本之间的替代性。这适用于外国投资和...",
    "tldr": "本文研究了北马其顿制造业劳动力份额与最低工资之间的关系。研究结果表明，最低工资对劳动力份额有着行业特定的影响。对于劳动力密集型且工资低的行业，最低工资会增加工人的劳动力份额，并体现出资本与劳动之间的互补性。而对于资本密集型行业，最低工资会减少劳动力份额，可能是因为存在劳动岗位的减少和劳动力与资本之间的替代性。"
