In particular, we give concrete lower bounds for rotated copies of random vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with uncorrelated components by computing the Bures metric between the covariance matrices. We also derive upper bounds for compositions of affine maps which yield a fruitful variety of diffeomorphisms applied to an initial data measure. We apply these bounds to various distributions including those lying on a 1-dimensional manifold in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and illustrate the quality of the bounds. Finally, we give a framework for mimicking handwritten digit or alphabet datasets that can be applied in a manifold learning framework.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们阐述了关于在Wasserstein空间中用于数据流型学习的随机向量之间的二次Wasserstein距离的一些已知下界，重点是仿射变换。特别地，我们通过计算协方差矩阵之间的Bures距离，给出了旋转的随机向量在具有不相关分量的$\\mathbb{R}^2$空间中的具体下界。我们还得到了仿射变换的组合的上界，从而产生了应用于初始数据测度的丰富的微分同胚。我们将这些界应用于包括在$\\mathbb{R}^2$中的一维流型上的各种分布，并说明了这些界的质量。最后，我们提供了一个在流型学习框架中可以应用于模拟手写数字或字母数据集的框架。",
