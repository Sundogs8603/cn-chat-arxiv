    "abstract": "Divorce is one of the most common social issues in developed countries like in the United States. Almost 50% of the recent marriages turn into an involuntary divorce or separation. While it is evident that people vary to a different extent, and even over time, an incident like Divorce does not interrupt the individual's daily activities; still, Divorce has a severe effect on the individual's mental health, and personal life. Within the scope of this research, the divorce prediction was carried out by evaluating a dataset named by the 'divorce predictor dataset' to correctly classify between married and Divorce people using six different machine learning algorithms- Logistic Regression (LR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Gaussian Na\\\"ive Bayes (NB), and, Support Vector Machines (SVM). Preliminary computational results show that algorithms such as SVM, KNN, and LDA, can perform that task with an accuracy of 98.5",

    "translated_abstract": "离婚是像美国这样的发达国家中最常见的社会问题之一。最近的婚姻中有近50％转变为非自愿的离婚或分居。尽管人们在很大程度上会发生变化，甚至随着时间的推移，但像离婚这样的事件并没有打断个人的日常活动；然而，离婚对个人的心理健康和个人生活产生了严重影响。在这项研究的范围内，通过评估名为“离婚预测数据集”的数据集，使用六种不同的机器学习算法（逻辑回归（LR）、线性判别分析（LDA）、K-最近邻（KNN）、分类回归树（CART）、高斯朴素贝叶斯（NB）和支持向量机（SVM））准确分类婚姻和离婚人群。初步的计算结果表明，SVM、KNN和LDA等算法可以以98.5的准确率执行这个任务。",
