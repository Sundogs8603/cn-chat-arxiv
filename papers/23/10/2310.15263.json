    "translated_abstract": "揭示有意义且可解释的神经相互作用对于理解神经回路至关重要。从神经信号推断出的神经相互作用主要反映功能性相互作用。在长时间的实验中，实验对象动物可能会经历由实验、刺激或行为状态定义的不同阶段，因此功能性相互作用可能会随时间而变化。为了建模动态变化的功能性相互作用，先前的工作采用隐藏马尔可夫模型的状态切换广义线性模型（即HMM-GLMs）。然而，我们认为这些模型在生物学可信度上存在一些问题，因为功能性相互作用是受到潜在解剖连通图的影响和限制的。在这里，我们提出了一种新颖的先验信息驱动的状态切换GLM。我们在每个状态下引入了高斯先验和独热先验。这些先验是可学习的。我们将展示学习到的先验应该捕捉到状态恒定的相互作用，从而揭示潜在的解剖连通图。",
