    "abstract": "We propose an operating-envelope-aware, prosumer-centric, and efficient energy community that aggregates individual and shared community distributed energy resources and transacts with a regulated distribution system operator (DSO) under a generalized net energy metering tariff design. To ensure safe network operation, the DSO imposes dynamic export and import limits, known as dynamic operating envelopes, on end-users' revenue meters. Given the operating envelopes, we propose an incentive-aligned community pricing mechanism under which the decentralized optimization of community members' benefit implies the optimization of overall community welfare. The proposed pricing mechanism satisfies the cost-causation principle and ensures the stability of the energy community in a coalition game setting. Numerical examples provide insights into the characteristics of the proposed pricing mechanism and quantitative measures of its performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个基于工作区间的、以消费者为中心的、高效的能源社区，该社区汇集了个人和共享的社区分布式能源资源，并在一个广义的净能量计费设计下与监管的配电系统运营商（DSO）进行交易。为了确保安全的网络运行，DSO对终端用户的收入计量器施加了动态的出口和进口限制，称为动态工作区间。在给定工作区间的情况下，我们提出了一种激励对齐的社区定价机制，其中社区成员的分散优化导致整个社区福利的优化。所提出的定价机制满足成本因果关系原则，并保证了能源社区在联盟博弈环境中的稳定性。数值实例提供了关于所提出的定价机制特性的见解和其性能的定量度量。",
