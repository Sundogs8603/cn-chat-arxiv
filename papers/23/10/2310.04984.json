    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了当测量矩阵是从一个酉矩阵中随机子采样得到时的生成式压缩感知问题（离散傅立叶变换是重要的特殊情况）。最近的研究表明，当每个傅立叶向量与神经网络的取值范围对齐时，只需要$O(kdn\\|\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\|_{\\infty}^{2})$个均匀随机傅立叶测量就足以恢复输出信号。我们构建了一个模型适应的采样策略，其样本复杂度得到了改进，只需要$O(kd\\|\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\|_{2}^{2})$个测量。这是通过以下步骤实现的：（1）我们开发了适用于非均匀随机采样分布  的新的理论恢复保证，然后（2）优化采样分布以最小化这些保证所需的测量数量。这种技术发展提供了适用的样本复杂度。",
