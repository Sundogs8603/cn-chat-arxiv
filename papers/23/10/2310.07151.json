The exact functional form of the latent social characteristic is not known. The proposed estimators are obtained based on matching pairs of agents whose network formation distributions are the same. The consistency and the asymptotic distribution of the estimators are proposed. The finite sample properties of the proposed estimators in a Monte-Carlo simulation are assessed. We conclude this study with an empirical application.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了半参数二元网络模型的识别和估计，其中未观测到的社会特征是内生的，即未观测到的个体特征影响了感兴趣的二元结果以及在网络内部形成联系的方式。潜在社会特征的确切函数形式是未知的。所提出的估计量是基于网络形成分布相同的匹配对之间的配对。提出了估计量的一致性和渐近分布。通过蒙特卡洛模拟评估了所提出的估计量的有限样本特性。最后，对该研究进行了实证应用。",
