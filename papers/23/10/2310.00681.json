    "translated_abstract": "随着可访问化合物库的规模扩大到超过100亿个，对更高效的基于结构的虚拟筛选方法的需求正在出现。尽管已经开发了不同的预筛选方法来快速筛选库，但适用于通用蛋白质的基于结构的方法仍然缺乏：挑战是在极短的时间内预测蛋白质和配体之间的结合位姿并进行评分。我们引入PharmacoNet，这是一个深度学习框架，它通过从结合位点生成的最佳三维药物谱排列来识别配体应该具有的稳定结合要求。通过粗粒化图匹配，我们在一步中解决了现有方法中昂贵的结合位姿采样和评分过程。PharmacoNet比最先进的基于结构的方法要快得多，但仍具有合理的准确性和简单的评分函数。此外，我们展示了有希望的再利用效果。",
