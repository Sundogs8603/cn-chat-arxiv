    "translated_abstract": "最近，人工智能的显著进展归功于自监督学习方案的整合。尽管在NLP领域取得了令人瞩目的成就，但与计算机视觉相比，自监督学习在计算机视觉领域还不能保持相应的发展。最近，将对比学习与现有的自监督学习模型结合起来，在计算机视觉领域取得了显著的进展，视觉自监督学习模型表现出超越有监督模型的能力。然而，大多数这些改进都局限于分类任务，并且只有少数工作致力于评估计算机视觉实际场景下的自监督学习模型，而大部分工作集中在包含类别人像图像的数据集中，尤其是ImageNet。因此，在本研究中，我们考虑了安全检查X射线图像中的语义分割的密集预测任务来评估我们提出的模型SegLoc。",
