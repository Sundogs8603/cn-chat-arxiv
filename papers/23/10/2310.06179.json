    "translated_abstract": "学习连续时间的点过程对于许多离散事件预测任务至关重要。然而，对于时空点过程（STPPs）的积分问题是一个重要挑战，因为它涉及到对空间和时间进行三重积分计算。现有的STPP积分方法要么假设强度函数具有参数形式，这缺乏灵活性；要么用蒙特卡洛采样来近似强度，这引入了数值误差。Omi等人最近的工作提出了一个自动积分方法AutoInt，用于高效地积分灵活的强度函数，但该方法只关注1D时间点过程。本文将AutoInt方法扩展至3D STPP，提出了一种新的范式：AutoSTPP（自动化的时空神经点过程积分方法）。我们表明，直接扩展之前的工作会过于约束强度函数，导致性能不佳。我们证明了我们的方法在各种实验中的优越性能。",
