    "abstract": "The accurate classification of student help requests with respect to the type of help being sought can enable the tailoring of effective responses. Automatically classifying such requests is non-trivial, but large language models (LLMs) appear to offer an accessible, cost-effective solution. This study evaluates the performance of the GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models for classifying help requests from students in an introductory programming class. In zero-shot trials, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 exhibited comparable performance on most categories, while GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 in classifying sub-categories for requests related to debugging. Fine-tuning the GPT-3.5 model improved its performance to such an extent that it approximated the accuracy and consistency across categories observed between two human raters. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs to enhance educational systems through the automated classification of student needs.",

    "translated_abstract": "准确分类与所寻求的帮助类型相关的学生求助请求可以实现针对性的有效响应。自动分类这类请求是非平凡的，但大型语言模型（LLMs）似乎提供了一种易于使用、经济实惠的解决方案。本研究评估了GPT-3.5和GPT-4模型在初级编程课程中对学生求助请求进行分类的性能。在零-shot测试中，GPT-3.5和GPT-4在大多数类别上表现出可比性，而GPT-4在与调试相关的子类别的分类上胜过GPT-3.5。对GPT-3.5模型进行微调可以提高其性能，以至于它在各类别之间的准确性和一致性上接近于两位人类评分者之间的观察结果。总体而言，本研究证明了使用LLMs通过自动分类学生需求来增强教育系统的可行性。",
