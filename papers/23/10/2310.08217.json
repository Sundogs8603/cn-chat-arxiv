    "translated_abstract": "持续学习（CL）对于深度神经网络来说一直是一个持久的挑战，原因是先前学习的任务会发生灾难性遗忘（CF）。已经提出了一些技术来减轻CF，例如权重正则化，经验重演和参数隔离。尽管相对成功，但这些研究方向主要是相互独立的，存在一些缺点，并且错过了竞争策略的优势。相反，大脑通过同时利用多种神经生理过程（包括神经发生，主动遗忘，神经调节，元可塑性，经验重演和上下文相关的门控），不常导致CF，而是持续学习，适应和跨任务传递知识。受大脑如何同时利用多个机制的启发，我们提出了TriRE，一种新的CL范式，旨在保留每个任务中最显著的神经元，修订和巩固这些神经元之间的联系。",
