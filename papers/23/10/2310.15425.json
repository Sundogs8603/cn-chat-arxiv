    "translated_abstract": "强制对齐系统在给定正字法转录的语音数据中自动确定分段边界。这些工具在语音学中很常见，以便使用那些手动转录和分段难以实现的语音数据。在本文中，我们描述了一个新的基于神经网络的强制对齐系统，即Mason-Alberta音标分割器（MAPS）。MAPS对齐器作为我们追求强制对齐系统两个潜在改进的试验平台。第一个是将强制对齐器中的声学模型视为标注任务，而不是分类任务，这是基于人们对语音中的段落并不是真正离散和常常重叠的共同认识。第二个是插值技术，使得边界可以比现代强制对齐系统常见的10毫秒限制更精确。我们将我们系统的配置与最先进的系统Montreal Forced Aligner进行比较。",
