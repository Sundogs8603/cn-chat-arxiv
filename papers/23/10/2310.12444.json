    "abstract": "Entity linking aims to link ambiguous mentions to their corresponding entities in a knowledge base. One of the key challenges comes from insufficient labeled data for specific domains. Although dense retrievers have achieved excellent performance on several benchmarks, their performance decreases significantly when only a limited amount of in-domain labeled data is available. In such few-shot setting, we revisit the sparse retrieval method, and propose an ELECTRA-based keyword extractor to denoise the mention context and construct a better query expression. For training the extractor, we propose a distant supervision method to automatically generate training data based on overlapping tokens between mention contexts and entity descriptions. Experimental results on the ZESHEL dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models by a significant margin across all test domains, showing the effectiveness of keyword-enhanced sparse retrieval.",

    "translated_abstract": "实体链接旨在将模糊的提及链接到知识库中的相应实体。其中一个主要挑战来自于特定领域标记数据不足。尽管密集的检索方法在一些基准数据集上取得了出色的性能，但是当只有有限数量的领域内标记数据时，它们的性能显著下降。在这种少样本情况下，我们重新审视了稀疏检索方法，并提出了一种基于ELECTRA的关键词提取器来去除提及上下文的噪声并构建更好的查询表达式。为了训练提取器，我们提出了一种远程监督方法，根据提及上下文和实体描述之间的重叠标记自动生成训练数据。在ZESHEL数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的方法在所有测试领域中比现有最先进模型的性能有显著提高，展示了关键词增强的稀疏检索的有效性。",
