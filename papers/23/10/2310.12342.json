    "translated_abstract": "Thought Chain（CoT）提示及其变体通过模拟人类线性认知和逻辑，探索为大型语言模型（LLM）装备高级推理能力。然而，人类思维复杂且混合线性和非线性思维。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的提示方式，称为推断性排除提示（IEP），它结合了排除和推理的原则，以引导LLM进行非线性思考。IEP指导LLM进行规划，并利用自然语言推理（NLI）推断每个可能解与上下文、常识或事实的推理关系，从而通过回溯推理获得更广泛的视角。相比其他基于CoT的方法，IEP的前向规划和后向排除过程更好地模拟了复杂的人类思维过程，后者仅反映线性认知过程。我们进行了一系列的实证研究，并验证了IEP的优势。",
