    "abstract": "In this paper, a unified framework for exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed based on an option-critic model. The proposed framework learns to integrate a set of diverse exploration strategies so that the agent can adaptively select the most effective exploration strategy over time to realize a relevant exploration-exploitation trade-off for each given task. The effectiveness of the proposed exploration framework is demonstrated by various experiments in the MiniGrid and Atari environments.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于选项批判模型的强化学习探索统一框架。该框架学习集成一组多样化的探索策略，使得智能体可以适应性地选择最有效的探索策略，以实现给定任务下的相关探索-开发权衡。通过在MiniGrid和Atari环境中进行各种实验，证明了所提出探索框架的有效性。",
