    "translated_abstract": "识别脆弱性对于了解和实施有针对性的支持以增强有需要的个人至关重要。这一点在欧洲人权法院尤为重要，法院将公约标准调整为满足实际个体需求，从而确保有效的人权保护。然而，脆弱性概念在欧洲人权法院仍然模糊不清，之前没有NLP研究涉及到这个问题。为了促进未来在这个领域的研究，我们提出了VECHR，一个新颖的专家注释的多标签数据集，包括脆弱性类型分类和解释理由。我们从预测和解释性的角度对VECHR上的最先进模型的性能进行了基准测试。我们的结果表明了这一任务的具有挑战性的特点，预测性能较低，并且模型和专家之间存在有限的一致性。此外，我们分析了这些模型处理域外数据的鲁棒性，并发现总体上受限。",
