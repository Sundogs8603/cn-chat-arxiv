    "translated_abstract": "知识表示（KR）在设计符号符号来表示现实世界的事实并促进自动化决策任务中至关重要。知识图谱（KGs）迄今已成为流行的知识表示形式，提供了有关知识的上下文和类似人类的表达。在国际经济领域中，KGs已证明在捕捉商品、公司和国家之间复杂互动方面具有价值。将重力模型（一种常见的经济框架）融入到构建KGs的过程中，可以考虑影响贸易关系的重要因素，从而使得预测国际贸易模式成为可能。本文提出了一种利用知识图谱嵌入进行建模国际贸易的方法，重点关注使用嵌入进行链接预测。因此，为决策者、企业和经济学家提供了宝贵的见解，使他们能够预计国际贸易体系变化的影响。",
