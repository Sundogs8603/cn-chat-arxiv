    "translated_abstract": "机器学习，尤其是表示学习，有潜力通过在硅基中筛选大量化学空间来促进药物发现。表示分子的一种成功方法是将其视为图形并利用图形神经网络。这类方法的一个关键限制是需要使用不同数量的原子来表示化合物，这需要对原子信息进行聚合。常见的聚合操作，如取平均，会导致在原子级别上丢失信息。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的聚合方法，其中每个原子都使用类似于温度的超参数进行非线性加权，采用玻尔兹曼分布。我们证明使用这种加权聚合方法可以提高黄金标准信息传递神经网络预测抗生素活性的能力。此外，通过改变温度超参数，我们的方法可以平滑地揭示对活性预测重要的原子。",
