    "translated_abstract": "由于脑电图 (EEG) 信号中丰富的神经生理信息，将 EEG 信号与深度学习方法相结合已在许多实际任务中取得了显著的进展。然而，基于 EEG 信号的监督学习方法的发展受到了高昂的成本和大规模 EEG 数据集手动标记的显著标签不一致性的阻碍。自监督框架在视觉和语言领域得到了采用，以解决这个问题，但缺乏 EEG 特定的理论基础限制了它们在不同任务中的适用性。为了解决这些挑战，本文提出了一种基于知识驱动的跨视图对比学习框架 (KDC2)，它将神经学理论与有限标签的 EEG 中提取有效表示相结合。KDC2 方法创建了 EEG 信号的头皮和神经视图，模拟了脑活动的内部和外部表示。随后，通过视图和跨视图对比学习逐步完成特征提取和表示学习。",
