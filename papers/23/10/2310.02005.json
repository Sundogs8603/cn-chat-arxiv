    "translated_abstract": "Tsetlin机器（TM）因其通过命题公式学习概念的能力以及在各个应用领域中被证明的高效性而引起了越来越多的关注。尽管如此，特别是在广义情况（输入大于两位）下，对于Tsetlin机器的收敛证明仍然是一个待解决的问题，特别是对于AND运算符（文献reasonable literals的性质）。本文旨在通过提出Tsetlin自动机机器学习算法的全面收敛分析来填补这一空白。我们引入了一种新的框架，称为概率概念学习（PCL），该框架简化了TM的结构，同时结合了专用的反馈机制和专用的包含/排除概率来处理合取式中的字面量。给定n个特征，PCL旨在学习一组与每个不同包含概率pi相关联的合取条款Ci。最重要的是，我们建立了一个理论证明，证实了对于任何子句Ck，PCL都收敛到一个合取式。",
