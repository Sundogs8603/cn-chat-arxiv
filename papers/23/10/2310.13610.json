    "translated_abstract": "在各种自然语言处理任务中，用自然语言解释黑盒模型的行为已经取得了令人印象深刻的结果。最近的研究探索了利用输入文本的子序列作为解释的方法，为用户提供支持模型决策的证据。尽管现有的框架在生成高质量解释的同时取得了高任务性能，但它们忽略了生成的解释与模型决策之间的不可靠联系。换句话说，模型可能在归因错误的情况下做出正确的决策，或者在归因正确的情况下做出糟糕的决策。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个称为自我归因和决策制定的统一两阶段框架（SADM）。通过对ERASER基准测试的五个推理数据集进行广泛实验，我们证明了我们的框架不仅能建立生成解释和模型决策之间更可靠的联系，而且还能取得竞争性的结果。",
