    "translated_abstract": "在现代面向服务的架构中，确保服务质量（QoS）非常重要。提前预测QoS值的能力使用户能够做出明智的决策。然而，在存在各种问题和异常情况（包括异常值、数据稀疏性、灰羊实例和冷启动场景）的情况下实现准确的QoS预测仍然是一个挑战。当前最先进的方法在同时解决这些问题时往往表现不佳，导致性能下降。在本文中，我们介绍了一个具有特别强调改善对数据中异常的鲁棒性的实时QoS预测框架（称为ARRQP）。ARRQP利用图卷积技术的力量来捕捉用户和服务之间复杂的关系和依赖，即使数据有限或稀疏。ARRQP整合了上下文信息和协作见解，实现了对用户-服务交互的全面理解。",
