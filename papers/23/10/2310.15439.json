This research gap calls for developing high-quality corpora in diverse languages that also encapsulate more subtle hate expressions. This study introduces K-HATERS, a new corpus for hate speech detection in Korean, comprising approximately 192K news comments with target-specific offensiveness ratings. This resource is the largest offensive language corpus in Korean and is the first to offer target-specific ratings on a three-point Likert scale, enabling the detection of hate expressions in Korean across varying degrees of offensiveness. We conduct experiments showing the effectiveness of the proposed corpus, including a comparison with existing datasets.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管已经提出了许多数据集来打击网络仇恨言论的传播，但其中大多数都是以英语为中心，主要关注明显的仇恨形式。这种研究空白要求我们开发高质量的多语言语料库，包括更微妙的仇恨表达。本研究引入了K-HATERS，一个新的韩语仇恨言论检测语料库，包括约192,000条新闻评论，附带目标特定的冒犯性评级。该资源是韩文中最大的冒犯性语言语料库，也是首个提供三点里克特量表上的目标特定评级的资源，可以在不同程度的冒犯性下检测韩语中的仇恨表达。我们进行了实验证明了该语料库的有效性，并与现有数据集进行了比较。此外，为了解决人类注释中的潜在噪声和偏差问题，我们探索了采用认知反射测试的新想法。",
