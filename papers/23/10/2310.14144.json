    "translated_abstract": "我们研究如何以最小的交易成本解构随机订单流程。随机订单流程在金融机构的中央风险簿（CRB）中出现，CRB是一个集中交易台，用于汇总金融机构内的订单流程。该交易台可以存储流入订单，理想情况下将其与随后的相反订单进行净化（内部化），或将其路由到市场（外部化）并承担与价格影响和买卖价差相关的成本。我们对一般类别的流入过程建模并解决了这个问题，使我们能够详细研究流入特征如何影响最优策略和核心交易指标。我们的模型允许半闭合形式的分析解，并且可以进行数值实现。与已知订单大小的标准执行问题相比，解构策略对预期未来流入有一个附加调整。其符号取决于订单的自相关性；只有真实流（鞅）才会被解构。",
