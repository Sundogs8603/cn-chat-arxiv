We propose the \\texttt{PF-PNE} algorithm with a unique double elimination strategy, which safely eliminates the non-optimal regions while encouraging federated collaboration through biased but effective evaluations of the local objectives. The proposed \\texttt{PF-PNE} algorithm is able to optimize local objectives with arbitrary levels of heterogeneity, and its limited communications protects the confidentiality of the client-wise reward data. Our theoretical analysis shows the benefit of the proposed algorithm over single-client algorithms.
