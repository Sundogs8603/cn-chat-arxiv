    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了Chiarella-Heston模型，一种新的基于agent的模型，用于改进深度对冲策略的有效性。该模型包括动量交易者、基本交易者和波动交易者。波动交易者通过创新地遵循Heston风格的波动率信号参与市场。所提出的模型广义地推广了扩展的Chiarella模型和Heston随机波动率模型，并通过校准以尽可能多地复现经验风格数据。根据经验风格距离度量，所提出的模型能够比三个基准模型：扩展的Chiarella模型、Heston模型和几何布朗运动模型，更真实地复现金融时间序列。所提出的模型还通过广义减法L-散度度量进行了验证。利用所提出的Chiarella-Heston模型，我们生成了一个训练数据集，用于训练在不同交易成本水平下的最优对冲策略的深度对冲agent。",
