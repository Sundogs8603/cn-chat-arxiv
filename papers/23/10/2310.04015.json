    "translated_abstract": "尽管个性化推荐系统变得越来越流行，但确保用户数据的保护仍然是这些学习系统开发中的一个重要关注点。增强隐私的常见方法是使用匿名数据而不是个体数据来训练模型。在本文中，我们探索了一种名为“类似样本聚类”的自然技术，它涉及将个体的敏感特征替换为聚类的平均值。我们对使用匿名聚类中心训练模型如何影响其泛化能力进行了精确的分析。我们关注一个渐近情况，即训练集的大小与特征维度成比例增长。我们的分析基于凸高斯极小化极大定理（Convex Gaussian Minimax Theorem，CGMT），使我们能够在理论上理解不同模型组成部分对泛化误差的作用。此外，我们证明在某些高维情况下，通过匿名聚类中心进行训练能够取得更好的效果。",
