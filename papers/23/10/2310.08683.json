    "translated_abstract": "强化学习在游戏领域取得了重大突破，尤其是谷歌DeepMind的AlphaGo击败了人类围棋冠军柯洁。这一胜利也得益于Atari学习环境(ALE)，ALE在RL研究中具有重要意义，促进了AlphaGo和其他RL算法的发展。当前的Atari视频游戏RL研究中，RL智能体对环境的感知基于Atari视频游戏屏幕的原始像素数据，且图像预处理很少。相反，最先进的ML研究在增强图像感知方面取得了突破，其中一个显著的例子是Meta Research的“任何物体”的分割模型(SAM)，它是一个能够在没有训练的情况下分割图像的基础模型。本文探讨一个新颖的方法论问题：像SAM这样的最先进图像分割模型能否提高RL智能体在玩Atari视频游戏时的性能。",
