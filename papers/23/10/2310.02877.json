    "translated_abstract": "高斯过程（GP）回归在机器学习应用中已经广泛流行。GP回归的行为取决于协方差函数的选择。在机器学习应用中，静止协方差函数是首选。然而，（非周期性的）静止协方差函数总是均值回归的，因此在应用于不通过到固定全局均值值的数据时可能表现出病态行为。在本文中，我们展示了使用具有无限方差的不恰当GP先验来定义静止但不均值回归过程是可能的。为此，我们引入了一大类只能在这种不恰当的范围内定义的不恰当核函数。具体地，我们引入了平滑行走核，它产生无限平滑的样本，以及一类不恰当的Matern核，它可以被定义为任意整数j倍可微。所得到的后验分布可以用解析的方式计算出来。",
