    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种面向在线市场的新型谈判对话代理。我们的代理具有整合性的特点，即它具有在价格谈判以及其他因素（如交易捆绑包的添加或删除）上进行谈判的能力，从而提供更灵活、全面的谈判体验。我们创建了一个名为综合谈判数据集（IND）的新数据集，以实现这种功能。为了创建这个数据集，我们引入了一种新的半自动数据创建方法，结合定义谈判意图、动作以及用户和代理之间的意图-动作模拟，生成潜在的对话流程。最后，我们使用目前最先进的语言模型GPT-J进行提示，为给定的意图生成对话，并通过人在环节的后编辑和修正来确保高质量的数据。我们采用一组新颖的奖励机制，专门针对谈判任务进行训练。",
