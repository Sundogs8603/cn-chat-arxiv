    "translated_abstract": "原型化AI应用一直是困难的。虽然大型语言模型（LLM）的提示大大降低了AI原型化的障碍，但设计师仍然独立地原型化AI功能和UI。我们研究了提示和UI设计的耦合如何影响设计师的工作流程。在这项研究的基础上，我们开发了PromptInfuser，一个Figma插件，它可以使用户通过将UI元素连接到提示的输入和输出来创建半功能的模型。在与14位设计师的研究中，我们将PromptInfuser与设计师当前的AI原型化工作流进行了比较。PromptInfuser被认为在传达产品理念方面更有用，能够更真实地呈现设想的设计原型，原型制作更高效，并且在预测UI问题和技术限制方面更有帮助。PromptInfuser鼓励同时迭代提示和UI，这有助于设计师发现UI和提示的不兼容性。",
