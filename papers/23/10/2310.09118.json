    "translated_abstract": "工业、研究和公共部门的信息通常存储为渲染文档（如PDF文件、扫描件）。因此，为了实现下游任务，需要将渲染文档映射到结构化的层次格式。然而，现有的系统在这一任务上被启发式方法所限制，且无法进行端到端的训练。在本文中，我们引入了一种名为 Document Structure Generator (DSG) 的新型文档解析系统，该系统可以进行完全端到端的训练。DSG结合了深度神经网络来解析（i）文档中的实体（如图像、文本块、标题等）和（ii）捕捉实体之间顺序和嵌套结构的关系。与依赖启发式方法的现有系统不同，我们的DSG进行了端到端的训练，使其在现实世界的应用中高效且灵活。我们还贡献了一个名为E-Periodica的新的大规模数据集，其中包含了具有复杂文档结构的实际杂志，用于评估。我们的结果表明...",
