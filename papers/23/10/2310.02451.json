    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理（NLP）方法已广泛应用于临床任务。机器学习和深度学习方法已被用于提高临床NLP的性能。然而，这些方法需要足够大的训练数据集，并且已经证明在不同机构之间传输模型的性能较差。这些问题导致了在不同机构之间进行数据收集和整合来得到准确和可移植的模型的推广。然而，这可能会引入一种称为溯源混淆的偏差形式。当部署时源特定数据分布不同时，这可能会损害模型性能。为了解决这个问题，我们评估了在多机构临床笔记数据集中使用后门调整进行文本分类的效用。使用设计用于衡量对分布变化的鲁棒性的评估框架，我们评估了后门调整的效果。我们的结果表明，后门调整的有效性",
