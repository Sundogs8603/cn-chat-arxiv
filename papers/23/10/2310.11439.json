    "abstract": "The remarkable success of deep neural networks (DNN) is often attributed to their high expressive power and their ability to approximate functions of arbitrary complexity. Indeed, DNNs are highly non-linear models, and activation functions introduced into them are largely responsible for this. While many works studied the expressive power of DNNs through the lens of their approximation capabilities, quantifying the non-linearity of DNNs or of individual activation functions remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose the first theoretically sound solution to track non-linearity propagation in deep neural networks with a specific focus on computer vision applications. Our proposed affinity score allows us to gain insights into the inner workings of a wide range of different architectures and learning paradigms. We provide extensive experimental results that highlight the practical utility of the proposed affinity score and its potential for long-reaching applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络(DNN)的显著成功常常归因于它们的高表达能力和近似任意复杂函数的能力。事实上，DNN是高度非线性的模型，其中引入的激活函数在其中起到了重要作用。然而，尽管许多研究通过近似能力的视角研究了DNN的表达能力，但量化DNN或个别激活函数的非线性仍然是一个开放性问题。在本文中，我们提出了第一个在具体关注计算机视觉应用中追踪非线性传播的理论有效解决方案。我们提出的亲和度评分允许我们深入了解各种不同体系结构和学习范式的内部工作原理。我们提供了大量的实验结果，突出了所提出的亲和度评分的实际效用和潜在应用的可能性。",
