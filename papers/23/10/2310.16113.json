    "abstract": "The architecture of the brain is too complex to be intuitively surveyable without the use of compressed representations that project its variation into a compact, navigable space. The task is especially challenging with high-dimensional data, such as gene expression, where the joint complexity of anatomical and transcriptional patterns demands maximum compression. Established practice is to use standard principal component analysis (PCA), whose computational felicity is offset by limited expressivity, especially at great compression ratios. Employing whole-brain, voxel-wise Allen Brain Atlas transcription data, here we systematically compare compressed representations based on the most widely supported linear and non-linear methods-PCA, kernel PCA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), t-stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), and deep auto-encoding-quantifying reconstruction fidelity, anatomical coherence, and predictive utility",

    "translated_abstract": "大脑的结构过于复杂，无法直观地进行观察，需要使用压缩表示将其变化投影到紧凑、可导航的空间中。在高维数据（如基因表达）中，尤其具有挑战性，其中解剖和转录模式的联合复杂性要求最大压缩。目前的实践是使用标准的主成分分析（PCA），其计算效率受到限制，尤其在大压缩比下表现力有限。本研究利用全脑体素级Allen大脑图谱转录数据，系统比较了基于最广泛支持的线性和非线性方法（PCA，核PCA，非负矩阵分解（NMF），t-随机邻居嵌入（t-SNE），统一流形逼近和投影（UMAP），深度自编码）的压缩表示，量化重建保真度，解剖连贯性和预测效果。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了大脑基因转录的压缩表示方法，通过比较不同的线性和非线性方法，评估了它们在重建、解剖和预测方面的性能。",
