    "translated_abstract": "在许多情境下，干预可能对某些人比其他人更有效，因此定位干预可能是有益的。我们通过一个规模庞大的实地实验（超过53,000名大学生）来分析在学生助学金续签前使用“鼓励”策略的价值。我们首先使用基线方法进行定位。首先，我们基于一个估计异质处理效应的因果森林进行定位，并根据估计出的拥有最高处理效应的学生来进行处理。接下来，我们评估两种替代的定位策略，一种是针对在没有干预的情况下预测到低助学金续签概率的学生，另一种是针对预测到高概率的学生。预测的基线结果并不是定位的理想标准，而且在先验上也不清楚是优先考虑低、高还是中间的预测。",
    "tldr": "通过对学生进行因果与预测性定位的比较，研究探讨了在学生助学金续签领域实验中鼓励对象选择的价值。这项大规模实地实验揭示了定位干预对于不同学生的效果，为干预策略的优化提供了参考。",

By comparing causal and predictive targeting, the experiment reveals the effects of targeting interventions on different students and provides insights for optimizing intervention strategies."
