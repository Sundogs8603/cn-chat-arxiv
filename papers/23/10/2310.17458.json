    "translated_abstract": "协作车辆路径规划是指多家运输公司通过共享运输信息和代表对方执行运输请求而进行合作。这样可以实现规模经济，从而降低成本、减少温室气体排放和道路拥挤。然而，哪家公司应该与哪家公司合作，每家公司应该得到多少补偿，传统的博弈论解决概念，如Shapley值或核值，由于特征函数随参与者数量呈指数级增长，难以计算用于实际的协作车辆路径规划问题。这将需要指数次解决车辆路径规划问题（一个NP难问题）。因此，我们提出将该问题建模为一种联合讨价还价博弈，重要的是，代理商不被赋予特征函数的访问权限。相反，我们隐式推理特征函数，从而消除了评估VRP的需要，减少了计算复杂性。",
