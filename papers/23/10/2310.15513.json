    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于联合矩阵分解的分析工具，用于比较多语言和单语言模型的潜在表示。作为对探测的替代方案，该工具允许我们以联合的方式分析多组表示。使用该工具，我们研究了多语言预训练模型学习到的表示中在多大程度上以及如何反映了形态句法特征。我们对33种语言和17种形态句法类别进行了大规模的实证研究。我们的研究结果显示，在上层和下层之间编码形态句法信息的方式存在变化，而且受语言属性影响的特定类别差异。通过因式分解输出的层次聚类结果可以生成与语言学家手工制作的系统发生学树相关的树状结构。此外，我们发现因式分解输出与跨语言任务中观察到的性能之间存在强关联。我们公开发布了我们的代码以便研究社区使用。",
