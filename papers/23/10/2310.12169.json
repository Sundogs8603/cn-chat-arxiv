    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）在复杂网络中执行各种基于学习的任务时显示出显著的优点。GNN的优越性能往往与输入网络中节点级特征的可用性和质量相关。然而，对于许多网络应用来说，这种节点级信息可能是缺失或不可靠的，从而限制了GNN的适用性和功效。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为“以自我为中心的谱子图嵌入增强（ESGEA）”的新方法，旨在增强和设计节点特征，特别是在信息缺失的情况下。我们的方法利用局部子图的拓扑结构来创建拓扑感知的节点特征。子图特征是使用高效的谱图嵌入技术生成的，它们作为节点特征捕捉了网络的局部拓扑组织。然后，如果存在明确的节点特征，则对其进行增强。",
