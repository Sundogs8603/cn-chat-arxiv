    "title": "Multilingual Coarse Political Stance Classification of Media. The Editorial Line of a ChatGPT and Bard Newspaper. (arXiv:2310.16269v1 [cs.CL])",
    "abstract": "Neutrality is difficult to achieve and, in politics, subjective. Traditional media typically adopt an editorial line that can be used by their potential readers as an indicator of the media bias. Several platforms currently rate news outlets according to their political bias. The editorial line and the ratings help readers in gathering a balanced view of news. But in the advent of instruction-following language models, tasks such as writing a newspaper article can be delegated to computers. Without imposing a biased persona, where would an AI-based news outlet lie within the bias ratings? In this work, we use the ratings of authentic news outlets to create a multilingual corpus of news with coarse stance annotations (Left and Right) along with automatically extracted topic annotations. We show that classifiers trained on this data are able to identify the editorial line of most unseen newspapers in English, German, Spanish and Catalan. We then apply the classifiers to 101 newspaper-lik",

    "translated_abstract": "中立性在政治中很难实现，也是主观的。传统媒体通常采取一种社论立场，这可以作为潜在读者用来判断媒体偏见的指标。目前有几个平台根据政治偏见对新闻机构进行评级。社论立场和评级有助于读者获得一种平衡的新闻观点。但是随着指令遵循型的语言模型的出现，如何在不施加偏见的情况下，人工智能新闻机构会位于何处的偏见评级？在这项工作中，我们使用真实新闻机构的评级来创建一个包含粗略立场注释（左翼和右翼）以及自动提取的主题注释的多语言新闻语料库。我们证明了在此数据上训练的分类器能够识别出英语、德语、西班牙语和加泰罗尼亚语的大多数未见报纸的社论立场。然后，我们将这些分类器应用于101份类似报纸的新闻刊物。",
