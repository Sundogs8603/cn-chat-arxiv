    "abstract": "Objective: As metabolic cost is a primary factor influencing humans' gait, we want to deepen our understanding of metabolic energy expenditure models. Therefore, this paper identifies the parameters and input variables, such as muscle or joint states, that contribute to accurate metabolic cost estimations. Methods: We explored the parameters of four metabolic energy expenditure models in a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. Then, we analysed the model parameters by their calculated sensitivity indices, physiological context, and the resulting metabolic rates during the gait cycle. The parameter combination with the highest accuracy in the Monte Carlo simulations represented a quasi-optimized model. In the second step, we investigated the importance of input parameters and variables by analysing the accuracy of neural networks trained with different input features.
