    "translated_abstract": "高效准确地检测制造业环境中的小物体（如缺陷和裂纹）对于确保产品质量和安全至关重要。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种综合策略，通过将Faster R-CNN与先进方法结合起来。通过将Faster R-CNN与特征金字塔网络相结合，我们使模型能够高效处理制造环境中固有的多尺度特征。此外，我们使用了可变形网络，可以根据缺陷的几何变化进行变形，并精确检测微小而复杂的特征。然后，我们在基础的ResNet50网络的每个块中加入了一种称为卷积块注意力模块的注意力机制，以选择性地强调信息丰富的特征并压制不太有用的特征。然后我们采用了RoI Align来替代RoI Pooling进行更精细的感兴趣区域对齐，最后集成Focal Loss来有效处理类别不平衡。",
