    "abstract": "Depth perception models are typically trained on non-interactive datasets with predefined camera trajectories. However, this often introduces systematic biases into the learning process correlated to specific camera paths chosen during data acquisition. In this paper, we investigate the role of how data is collected for learning depth completion, from a robot navigation perspective, by leveraging 3D interactive environments. First, we evaluate four depth completion models trained on data collected using conventional navigation techniques. Our key insight is that existing exploration paradigms do not necessarily provide task-specific data points to achieve competent unsupervised depth completion learning. We then find that data collected with respect to photometric reconstruction has a direct positive influence on model performance. As a result, we develop an active, task-informed, depth uncertainty-based motion planning approach for learning depth completion, which we call DEpth Uncert",

    "translated_abstract": "深度感知模型通常在预定义的相机轨迹上的非交互式数据集上进行训练。然而，这常常会引入与数据采集过程中选择的特定相机路径相关的系统偏差，影响学习过程。本文从机器人导航的视角，通过利用3D交互环境来调查数据收集对学习深度完整性的作用。首先，我们评估了四个使用传统导航技术收集数据进行训练的深度完整性模型。我们的关键观察是，现有的探索模式不一定提供任务具体数据点以实现有效的无监督深度完整性学习。然后，我们发现与光度重建相关的数据对模型性能有直接积极影响。因此，我们开发了一种基于深度不确定性的主动、任务导向的深度完整性学习的运动规划方法，称之为DEpth Uncert。",
