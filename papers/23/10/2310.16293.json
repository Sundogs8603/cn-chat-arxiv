    "translated_abstract": "众包系统已被用于积累大规模标记数据，用于计算机视觉和自然语言处理等应用。然而，由于众包标记的动态性和不确定性，开发一个在大多数情况下都能工作的技术是非常具有挑战性的。在本文中，我们介绍了一种名为Crowd-Certain的新颖方法，用于众包和集成学习分类任务中的标签聚合，该方法在不同的标注者数量和各种数据集上能够提供改进的性能和计算效率。所提出的方法使用标注者的一致性与训练好的分类器进行比较，为每个标注者确定可靠性得分。此外，Crowd-Certain利用预测概率，使得训练好的分类器可以在未来的样本数据上重复使用，从而消除了现有方法中固有的重复模拟过程。我们对我们的方法进行了广泛的评估，与其他十种现有方法进行了对比。",
