    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度神经网络在社会中越来越常见。在诊断不良模型行为时，识别哪些参数会触发错误分类是很有用的。本研究提出了参数敏感性的概念，并通过排名可能导致错误分类的卷积滤波器来诊断卷积神经网络(CNN)。研究还表明，对排名靠前的敏感滤波器进行微调可以有效纠正在ImageNet上的错误识别。然而，目前对于理解参数敏感性排名如何找到导致错误识别的滤波器仍存在知识差距。本研究试图通过从统计角度(极值理论)分析参数敏感性排名来弥补这一差距。我们首先展示了现有研究隐含地假设每个滤波器的梯度范数服从正态分布。然后，我们阐明了梯度范数与极值理论之间的关系。",
