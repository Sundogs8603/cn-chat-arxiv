    "translated_abstract": "在领先的协同过滤（CF）模型中，用户和项目的表示往往会学习训练数据中的流行度偏差作为快捷方式。流行度快捷方式对于在分布（ID）性能上是好的，但对于超出分布（OOD）的数据（即在测试数据的流行度分布与训练数据不同时），泛化能力较差。为了填补这个差距，去偏见策略尝试评估表示中的快捷方式程度，并将其减少。然而，存在两个不足之处：（1）在测量快捷方式程度时，大多数策略只使用单一方面的统计指标（即项目频率对项目和用户频率对用户方面），不能适应用户-项目对的组合程度；（2）在减少快捷方式时，许多策略假设测试分布事先已知。这导致质量较低的去偏见表示。更糟糕的是，这些策略以牺牲OOD泛化性能为代价。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种鲁棒的协同过滤方法，解决了训练数据中流行度偏差导致的泛化性能问题。通过评估和减少快捷方式程度，以及不需事先了解测试分布，提高了去偏见表示的质量和OOD泛化性能。",
    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a robust collaborative filtering approach to address the generalization issue caused by popularity bias in training data. By evaluating and mitigating the shortcut degrees, as well as without the need for prior knowledge of the test distribution, it improves the quality of debiased representations and OOD generalization performance."
