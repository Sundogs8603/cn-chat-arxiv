    "translated_abstract": "缩放分析是计算机政治学中的一种技术，它根据预定义的规模为政治行为者（例如政治家或政党）分配一个分数，该分数基于（通常是长的）文本体（例如议会演讲或选举宣言）。例如，政治科学家经常使用左右刻度来系统分析不同国家的政治景观。自动缩放分析的NLP方法可以找到广泛的应用，前提是它们能够处理长文本，并且在不同领域和语言中工作稳健。在这项工作中，我们实施并比较了两种自动缩放分析政党宣言的方法：标签聚合，一种依赖于宣言中个别陈述的注释的管道策略，以及基于长文本输入Transformer的模型，该模型直接从原始文本计算缩放值。我们对41个国家和27种语言的比较宣言项目数据集进行了分析。",
