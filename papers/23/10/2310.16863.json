    "translated_abstract": "弥漫大B细胞淋巴瘤（DLBCL）是涉及一个或多个淋巴结和淋巴外部位点的淋巴癌症。其诊断和随访依赖于正电子发射断层扫描（PET）和计算机断层扫描（CT）。在诊断后，标准一线治疗非反应患者的数量仍然很大（30-40%）。本文旨在开发一种计算机辅助方法，有效利用每个患者的所有可用信息，包括临床和图像数据，以识别需要适应性治疗的高风险患者。我们提出了一种基于最近的图神经网络的方法，结合了来自多个病变的图像信息，以及交叉注意力模块来有效地整合不同的数据模态。该模型在一个私人前瞻性多中心的数据集上进行训练和评估，该数据集包含583名患者。实验结果表明，我们提出的方法胜过了基于临床、图像或临床和图像的经典监督方法。",
