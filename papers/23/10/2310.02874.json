    "abstract": "For healthcare datasets, it is often not possible to combine data samples from multiple sites due to ethical, privacy or logistical concerns. Federated learning allows for the utilisation of powerful machine learning algorithms without requiring the pooling of data. Healthcare data has many simultaneous challenges which require new methodologies to address, such as highly-siloed data, class imbalance, missing data, distribution shifts and non-standardised variables. Federated learning adds significant methodological complexity to conventional centralised machine learning, requiring distributed optimisation, communication between nodes, aggregation of models and redistribution of models. In this systematic review, we consider all papers on Scopus that were published between January 2015 and February 2023 and which describe new federated learning methodologies for addressing challenges with healthcare data. We performed a detailed review of the 89 papers which fulfilled these criteria. S",

    "translated_abstract": "对于医疗保健数据集来说，由于伦理、隐私或后勤问题，通常不可能合并来自多个机构的数据样本。而联邦学习可以在不需要数据汇集的情况下利用强大的机器学习算法。医疗保健数据具有许多挑战，需要新的方法学来解决，如高度孤立的数据、类别不平衡、缺失数据、分布转移和非标准化变量。联邦学习对于传统的集中式机器学习增加了显著的方法学复杂性，需要分布式优化、节点间的通信、模型的聚合和模型的重新分发。在这个系统性综述中，我们考虑了Scopus上在2015年1月至2023年2月之间发表的所有描述解决医疗保健数据挑战的新联邦学习方法学的论文。我们对满足这些条件的89篇论文进行了详细的回顾。",
