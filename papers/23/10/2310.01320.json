    "translated_abstract": "最近在大型语言模型（LLM）的突破带来了在LLM作为智能体领域的显著成功。然而，一种普遍的假设是LLM处理的信息始终是诚实的，忽视了人类社会和AI生成内容中普遍存在的欺骗或误导性信息。这个疏忽使得LLM容易受到恶意操纵，可能导致不利的结果。本研究利用复杂的Avalon游戏作为测试平台，探索LLM在欺骗环境中的潜力。Avalon充满了错误信息，并需要复杂的逻辑，表现为“思考的游戏”。受到人类在Avalon游戏中递归思考和透视能力的启发，我们引入了一种新颖的框架——递归思考（ReCon），以增强LLM识别和对抗欺骗信息的能力。ReCon结合了公式化思考和完善思考的过程；公式化思考产生初始思考，完善思考对初始思考进行调整和改进。",
