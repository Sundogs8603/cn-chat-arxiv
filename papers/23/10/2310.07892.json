    "translated_abstract": "保持站位对于自主水面车辆（ASVs）来说是一项重要的操纵动作，特别是在狭小空间中使用，用于进行需要ASV保持位置或与其他车辆协作的调查任务。然而，由于对ASV动力学和环境干扰的精确建模的需求，这种操纵动作对于经典的反馈控制器而言可能变得具有挑战性。本研究提出了一种使用神经网络仿真误差最小化（NNSEM-MPC）的模型预测控制器，用于准确预测在风扰动下ASV的动力学。在机器人操作系统（ROS）和多用途仿真环境Gazebo上进行了对所提出方案在风扰动下的性能进行仿真测试，并与其他控制器进行了比较。通过组合两个风速（3 m/s和6 m/s）和三个风向（0°、90°和180°），进行了一系列六个测试。",
