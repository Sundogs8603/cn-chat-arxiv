    "abstract": "Objectives: Lung cancer remains a significant global public health challenge and is still one of the leading cause of cancer-related death in Argentina. This study aims to assess the disease and economic burden of lung cancer in the country.  Study design: Burden of disease study  Methods. A mathematical model was developed to estimate the disease burden and direct medical cost attributable to lung cancer. Epidemiological parameters were obtained from local statistics, the Global Cancer Observatory, the Global Burden of Disease databases, and a literature review. Direct medical costs were estimated through micro-costing. Costs were expressed in US dollars (US$), April 2023 (1 US$ =216.38 argentine pesos). A second-order Monte Carlo simulation was performed to estimate the uncertainty.  Results: Considering approximately 10,000 deaths, 12,000 incident cases, and 14,000 5-year prevalent cases, the economic burden of lung cancer in Argentina in 2023 was estimated to be US$ 556.20 million ",

    "translated_abstract": "目标：肺癌仍然是全球重要的公共卫生挑战，也是阿根廷肿瘤相关死亡的主要原因之一。本研究旨在评估该国肺癌的疾病和经济负担。研究设计：疾病负担研究方法：开发了一个数学模型，以估计与肺癌相关的疾病负担和直接医疗成本。流行病学参数从当地统计数据、全球癌症观察台、全球疾病负担数据库和文献综述中获得。通过微成本法评估直接医疗成本。成本以2023年4月的美元（1美元=216.38阿根廷比索）计算。进行二阶蒙特卡洛模拟以估计不确定性。结果：考虑到大约10,000例死亡、12,000例新发病例和14,000例5年患病病例，预计2023年阿根廷肺癌的经济负担将达到5.562亿美元",
