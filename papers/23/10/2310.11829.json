    "abstract": "Emerging as fundamental building blocks for diverse artificial intelligence applications, foundation models have achieved notable success across natural language processing and many other domains. Parallelly, graph machine learning has witnessed a transformative shift, with shallow methods giving way to deep learning approaches. The emergence and homogenization capabilities of foundation models have piqued the interest of graph machine learning researchers, sparking discussions about developing the next graph learning paradigm that is pre-trained on broad graph data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream graph tasks.

    "translated_abstract": "基于其在自然语言处理和其他领域中的显著成功，基础模型已经成为各种人工智能应用的基本构建模块。与此同时，图机器学习经历了由浅层方法向深度学习方法的转变。基础模型的出现和同化能力引起了图机器学习研究者的兴趣，引发了关于开发下一个预训练于广泛图数据并可适应各种下游图任务的图学习范式的讨论。然而，目前对这类工作尚无明确的定义和系统的分析。在本文中，我们提出了图基础模型(GFMs)的概念，并首次对其关键特征和技术进行全面阐述。在此基础上，我们根据其可靠性将现有GFMs工作分为三个类别。",
