    "translated_abstract": "在金融、气候科学和神经科学等领域，从时间序列数据中推断因果关系是一个巨大的挑战。尽管现代技术可以处理变量之间的非线性关系和灵活的噪声分布，但它们依赖于简化假设，即数据来自相同的潜在因果模型。在这项工作中，我们放松了这个假设，从来源于不同因果模型混合的时间序列数据中进行因果发现。我们推断了潜在的结构性因果模型，以及每个样本属于特定混合成分的后验概率。我们的方法采用了一个端对端的训练过程，最大化了数据似然的证据下界。通过对合成和真实世界数据集的广泛实验，我们证明了我们的方法在因果发现任务中超越了最先进的基准方法，尤其是当数据来自不同的潜在因果模型时。",
