    "translated_abstract": "非欧几里德流形上的数据，通常以表面网格的形式离散化，在计算机图形学、生物和物理系统中自然产生。特别是，流形上的偏微分方程（PDE）的解决方案严重依赖于底层几何结构。尽管图神经网络已成功应用于PDE，但它们不包含表面几何结构，也不考虑流形的局部规范对称性。与此相反，最近在网格上的规范等变卷积和注意力架构的研究利用底层几何结构，但在建模具有复杂非线性动力学的表面PDE时表现不佳。为解决这些问题，我们引入了一种新的使用非线性消息传递的规范等变架构。我们的新架构在具有高度复杂和非线性动力学的域上比卷积或注意力网络有更高的性能。然而，与非网格情况类似，设计上的权衡更倾向于卷积和注意力网络。",
