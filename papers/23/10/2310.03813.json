    "translated_abstract": "如何准确地向用户推荐冷启动捆绑？捆绑推荐中的冷启动问题在实际场景中至关重要，因为新建捆绑不断出现以满足各种营销目的。尽管其重要性，之前没有研究涉及冷启动捆绑推荐。此外，现有的冷启动物品推荐方法过于依赖历史信息，即使对于不受欢迎的捆绑也是如此，无法应对捆绑互动分布高度倾斜的主要挑战。在这项工作中，我们提出了CoHeat（基于流行度的聚合和课程加热），这是一种准确的冷启动捆绑推荐方法。CoHeat通过结合历史信息和关联信息来估计用户与捆绑之间的关系，以应对捆绑互动分布的高度倾斜问题。此外，CoHeat还通过利用课程学习和聚合特征学习效果地学习潜在表示。",
