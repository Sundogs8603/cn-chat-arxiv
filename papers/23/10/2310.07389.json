    "abstract": "Accelerated development of demand response service provision by the residential sector is crucial for reducing carbon-emissions in the power sector. Along with the infrastructure advancement, encouraging the end users to participate is crucial. End users highly value their privacy and control, and want to be included in the service design and decision-making process when creating the daily appliance operation schedules. Furthermore, unless they are financially or environmentally motivated, they are generally not prepared to sacrifice their comfort to help balance the power system. In this paper, we present an inverse-reinforcement-learning-based model that helps create the end users' daily appliance schedules without asking them to explicitly state their needs and wishes. By using their past consumption data, the end consumers will implicitly participate in the creation of those decisions and will thus be motivated to continue participating in the provision of demand response services.",

    "translated_abstract": "居民部门加速发展需求响应服务对于降低电力部门的碳排放至关重要。随着基础设施的进步，鼓励终端用户参与至关重要。终端用户非常重视自己的隐私和控制权，并希望在创建每日电器操作计划时参与到服务设计和决策过程中。此外，除非他们有经济或环境动机，他们通常不会准备牺牲自己的舒适度来帮助平衡电力系统。本文提出了一种基于逆强化学习的模型，可以在不要求用户明确陈述需求和愿望的情况下帮助创建用户每日的电器计划。通过使用他们过去的消费数据，终端消费者将隐式参与这些决策的制定，并因此得到继续参与需求响应服务提供的动力。",
