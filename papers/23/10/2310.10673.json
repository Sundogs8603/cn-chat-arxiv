    "abstract": "This paper shows how LLMs (Large Language Models) may be used to estimate a summary of the emotional state associated with piece of text. The summary of emotional state is a dictionary of words used to describe emotion together with the probability of the word appearing after a prompt comprising the original text and an emotion eliciting tail. Through emotion analysis of Amazon product reviews we demonstrate emotion descriptors can be mapped into a PCA type space. It was hoped that text descriptions of actions to improve a current text described state could also be elicited through a tail prompt. Experiment seemed to indicate that this is not straightforward to make work. This failure put our hoped for selection of action via choosing the best predict ed outcome via comparing emotional responses out of reach for the moment.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文展示了如何使用LLMs（大型语言模型）来估计与文本相关的情感状态的摘要。情感状态的摘要是一个词典，用于描述情感，并给出在原始文本和情感触发尾部组成的提示后，该词出现的概率。通过对亚马逊产品评论的情感分析，我们展示了情感描述词可以映射到类似PCA的空间中。希望通过尾部提示也可以引发关于改善当前文本所描述状态的动作的文本描述。实验似乎表明，这种工作并不容易实现。这种失败使得我们希望通过比较情感反应来选择最佳预测结果的行动目前无法实现。",
