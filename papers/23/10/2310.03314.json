    "translated_abstract": "人体动作预测是实现高效安全的人机协作的必要步骤。目前的方法要么完全依赖于将人类关节点表示为某种神经网络结构，要么使用离线回归模型来拟合超参数，以捕捉包含人体动作的模型。虽然这些方法提供了良好的初始结果，但它们未能利用研究充分的人体运动学模型以及身体和场景约束，这些约束有助于提高这些预测框架的效果，同时明确避免不合理的人体关节配置。我们提出了一种新颖的人体运动预测框架，该框架将人体关节约束和场景约束结合在高斯过程回归（GPR）模型中，以预测一定时间范围内的人体动作。此公式与在线上下文感知约束模型结合，以利用任务相关运动。在人体臂运动学模型上进行了测试。",
