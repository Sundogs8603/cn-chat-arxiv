    "abstract": "Due to the remarkable language understanding and generation abilities of large language models (LLMs), their use in educational applications has been explored. However, little work has been done on investigating the pedagogical ability of LLMs in helping students to learn mathematics. In this position paper, we discuss the challenges associated with employing LLMs to enhance students' mathematical problem-solving skills by providing adaptive feedback. Apart from generating the wrong reasoning processes, LLMs can misinterpret the meaning of the question, and also exhibit difficulty in understanding the given questions' rationales when attempting to correct students' answers. Three research questions are formulated.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于大型语言模型（LLM）具有卓越的语言理解和生成能力，因此研究了将其应用于教育领域。然而，目前还没有研究探讨LLM在帮助学生学习数学方面的教育能力。在这篇立场论文中，我们讨论了使用LLM提供个性化反馈来增强学生数学问题解决能力所面临的挑战。除了产生错误的推理过程外，LLM还可能误解问题的含义，并在尝试纠正学生答案时难以理解给定问题的理由。我们提出了三个研究问题。",
