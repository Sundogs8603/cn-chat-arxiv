    "translated_abstract": "由于存在治疗选择偏差，从观察数据中估计条件平均治疗效果是非常具有挑战性的。现有的方法通过在潜在空间中对不同处理组的分布进行对齐来缓解这个问题。然而，这些方法未能解决两个关键问题：（1）小批量采样效应（MSE），即在具有不平衡结果和异常值的非理想小批量中导致错误对齐；（2）未观察到的混杂变量效应（UCE），即由于忽略未观察到的混杂变量而导致的不准确差异计算。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种名为整体空间反事实回归（ESCFR）的原则性方法，它是在因果性背景下运用最优运输的新方法。具体来说，基于随机最优运输的框架，我们提出了一个松弛的保持质量的正则化项来解决MSE问题，并设计了一个处理UCE的近因事实结果正则化式。",
