    "translated_abstract": "学生建模对于许多教育技术来说至关重要，因为它可以预测未来的学习结果和有针对性的教学策略。然而，开放式学习环境会带来挑战，因为学生表现出多样化的行为且缺乏明确定义的学习技能集。为了应对这些挑战，我们探索在开放式学习环境中应用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行上下文学生建模。我们引入了一个新颖的框架LLM-SS，利用LLMs合成学生的行为。具体而言，给定一个特定学生在参考任务上的解决尝试作为观察，目标是合成该学生在目标任务上的尝试。我们的框架可以与不同的LLMs结合使用；而且，我们使用领域专家知识对LLMs进行微调，提高它们对领域背景和学生行为的理解。我们评估了几种具体的方法...",
