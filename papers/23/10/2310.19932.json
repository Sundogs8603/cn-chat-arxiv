    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于机器学习的天气模型已经有了快速的进展。这些模型通常是在数值数据同化系统的网格化再分析数据上训练的。然而，再分析数据存在一些限制，比如对物理定律的假设和低时空分辨率。再分析结果与真实情况之间的差距引发了直接在天气观测数据上训练机器学习模型的兴趣。对分散和稀疏的环境观测进行建模需要可扩展和灵活的机器学习架构，其中之一是卷积条件神经过程(ConvCNP)。ConvCNP可以学习在网格化和非网格化上下文数据上进行条件训练，以在目标位置上进行不确定性感知的预测。然而，真实观测的稀疏性对于深度学习模型（如ConvCNP）来说是个挑战。一种潜在的解决方案是“Sim2Real”：在再分析数据上进行预训练，然后在观测数据上进行微调。",
