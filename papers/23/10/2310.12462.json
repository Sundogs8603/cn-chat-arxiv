    "translated_abstract": "在深度学习领域中，Transformer已经成为了一种主导的架构，特别是在自然语言处理任务中。然而，随着它们的广泛应用，有关这些模型处理数据的安全性和隐私性的问题已经引起了关注。本文针对一个关键问题进行了研究：是否可以使用Transformer的注意力权重和输出来恢复输入数据？我们提出了一个理论框架来解决这个问题。具体地，我们介绍了一种算法，旨在通过最小化损失函数$L(X)$从给定的注意力权重$W = QK^\\top$和输出$B$中恢复输入数据$X$，其中$X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times n}$，$W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$，$B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$。这个损失函数捕捉了预期输出与实际输出之间的差异。我们的研究结果对于局部化分层机制（Localized Layer-wise Mechanism，LLM）具有重要的影响，表明模型设计存在潜在的漏洞。",
