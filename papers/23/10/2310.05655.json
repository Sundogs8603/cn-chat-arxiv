The non-reversible Markov chain relies on the operators used in Chickering's Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) and is endowed with a momentum variable, which improves mixing significantly as we show empirically.

    "translated_abstract": "在推断贝叶斯网络结构（有向无环图，DAG）的背景下，我们设计了一种非可逆连续时间马尔科夫链，即“因果Zig-Zag采样器”，该采样器针对一类观测等价（Markov等价）DAG的概率分布。这些类别以完成的部分有向无环图（CPDAG）表示。非可逆马尔科夫链依赖于Chickering的贪婪等价搜索（GES）中使用的操作符，并且具有一个动量变量，经实验证明可以显著改善混合性能。可能的目标分布包括基于DAG先验和Markov等价似然的后验分布。我们提供了一个高效的实现，其中我们开发了新的算法来列举、计数、均匀采样和应用GES操作符的可能移动，所有这些算法都显著改进了现有技术。",
