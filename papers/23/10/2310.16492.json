    "translated_abstract": "成功检测越界数据对于确保神经网络的安全部署变得越来越重要。越界检测的主要挑战之一是神经网络在越界数据上输出过度自信的预测，这使得仅根据预测来确定数据的越界性变得困难。异常曝光通过在训练过程中引入额外的损失，鼓励对越界数据进行低置信度预测，从而解决了这个问题。尽管异常曝光在提高越界检测性能方面显示出了很大潜力，但是之前所有关于异常曝光的研究都限于使用视觉异常。受到视觉语言预训练的最新进展的启发，本文首次探索了文本异常曝光在尚未开拓的领域。首先，我们通过用文本等价物替换图像域中的真实或虚拟异常值来揭示使用文本异常值的好处。接下来，我们提出了多种生成文本异常值的方法。",
