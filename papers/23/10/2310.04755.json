    "translated_abstract": "在当前普及性手机和平板的环境中，应用程序经常存在于两个平台上。虽然应用程序在手机和平板上共享大部分图形用户界面（GUI）和功能，但开发人员经常需要从头开始为平板版本重新构建，增加了开发成本并浪费了现有的设计资源。研究人员正尝试收集数据，并利用深度学习在自动化GUI开发中提高开发人员的生产力。目前存在一些公开可访问的手机GUI页面数据集，但没有关于手机和平板之间成对GUI的数据集。这对于在自动化GUI开发中使用深度学习构成了一个重要障碍。本文介绍了Papt数据集，这是一个专为Android手机和平板量身定制的开创性的成对GUI数据集，包括来自5593个不同应用程序对的10035个手机-平板GUI页面对。我们提出了新颖的成对GUI收集方法来构建这个数据集，并对其进行了界定。",
