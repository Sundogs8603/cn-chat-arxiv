    "abstract": "As machine learning technology gets applied to actual products and solutions, new challenges have emerged. Models unexpectedly fail to generalize to small changes in the distribution, tend to be confident on novel data they have never seen, or cannot communicate the rationale behind their decisions effectively with the end users. Collectively, we face a trustworthiness issue with the current machine learning technology. This textbook on Trustworthy Machine Learning (TML) covers a theoretical and technical background of four key topics in TML: Out-of-Distribution Generalization, Explainability, Uncertainty Quantification, and Evaluation of Trustworthiness. We discuss important classical and contemporary research papers of the aforementioned fields and uncover and connect their underlying intuitions. The book evolved from the homonymous course at the University of T\\\"ubingen, first offered in the Winter Semester of 2022/23. It is meant to be a stand-alone product accompanied by code snip",

    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习技术应用于实际产品和解决方案，出现了新的挑战。模型在分布的微小变化下意外地无法泛化，对于他们从未见过的新数据表现出自信，或者无法有效地向最终用户解释其决策的原理。总而言之，我们面临着当前机器学习技术的可信度问题。这本《可信任的机器学习》教材涵盖了可信任的机器学习的四个关键主题的理论和技术背景：分布之外的泛化、可解释性、不确定性量化和可信度评估。我们讨论了重要的经典和现代研究论文，并揭示并连接了它们的基本直觉。这本书是从2022/23冬季学期开始在图宾根大学开设的同名课程发展而来。它旨在成为一本独立的产品，附有代码片段。",
