    "abstract": "As more and more decisions that have a significant ethical dimension are being outsourced to AI systems, it is important to have a definition of moral responsibility that can be applied to AI systems. Moral responsibility for an outcome of an agent who performs some action is commonly taken to involve both a causal condition and an epistemic condition: the action should cause the outcome, and the agent should have been aware -- in some form or other -- of the possible moral consequences of their action. This paper presents a formal definition of both conditions within the framework of causal models. I compare my approach to the existing approaches of Braham and van Hees (BvH) and of Halpern and Kleiman-Weiner (HK). I then generalize my definition into a degree of responsibility.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着越来越多具有重大伦理纬度的决策被外包给AI系统，有必要制定一个适用于AI系统的道德责任定义。道德责任通常涉及因果条件和认知条件：行动应该导致结果，而代理人应该意识到行动可能产生的道德后果。本文在因果模型框架下提出了两种条件的形式定义。我将我的方法与Braham和van Hees (BvH)以及Halpern和Kleiman-Weiner (HK)的现有方法进行了比较。然后我将我的定义推广为一种责任程度。",
