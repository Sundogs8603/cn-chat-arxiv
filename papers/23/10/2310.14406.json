    "translated_abstract": "新的无线技术的出现，如物联网，使得数字化新的和多样化的城市活动成为可能。因此，无线通信流量的增长在量和复杂度上增加，使得预测、投资规划和监管变得越来越困难。本文对城市无线通信流量的演变进行了特征化，支持运营商推动移动网络的演进和政策制定者增加国家和地方的竞争力。我们提出了一种综合的方法，扩大了先前的研究范围，包括来自多个政府层级的新设备和政策的影响。我们提供了一个综合了现有互补方法和多样化数据源的分析公式。赫尔辛基中心区在2020-2030年期间的结果表明，每天的流量增加，尽管令人惊讶的是，仍然有很大一部分流量是由智能手机产生的。机器流量的重要性增加，受到监控摄像头和连接车辆的推动。",
    "tldr": "本研究对城市无线通信流量的演变进行了特征化，提出了一种方法来包括新设备和政策的影响。研究发现，城市的无线通信流量在增长，智能手机产生了大部分流量，而机器流量也越来越重要。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study characterizes the evolution of urban wireless traffic and proposes a method to incorporate the impact of new devices and policies. The research shows that urban wireless traffic is increasing, with smartphones generating a majority of the traffic and machine traffic gaining importance."
