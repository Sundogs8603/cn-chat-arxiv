To fill this gap, we propose Compatible Transformer (CoFormer), a transformer-based encoder to achieve comprehensive temporal-interaction feature learning for each individual sample in irregular multivariate time series. In CoFormer, we view each sample as a unique variate-time point and leverage intra-variate/inter-variate attentions to learn sample-wise temporal/interaction features based on intra-variate/inter-variate neighbors. With CoFormer as the core, we can analyze irregularly sample",

    "translated_abstract": "为了分析多变量时间序列，先前的大多数方法都假设时间序列的正则子采样，其中相邻测量之间的间隔和样本数量保持不变。实际上，由于传感器故障和干预，数据采集系统可能会产生不规则采样的时间序列。然而，现有的针对正则采样的多变量时间序列的方法无法直接处理不规则性，因为在时间和变量维度上存在错位。为了填补这个空白，我们提出了兼容Transformer（CoFormer），这是一种基于Transformer的编码器，用于在不规则的多变量时间序列中为每个个体样本实现全面的时序交互特征学习。在CoFormer中，我们将每个样本视为一个独特的变量-时间点，并利用内变量/间变量注意力来学习基于内变量/间变量相邻点的逐样本时序/交互特征。借助CoFormer作为核心，我们可以分析不规则的采样。",
