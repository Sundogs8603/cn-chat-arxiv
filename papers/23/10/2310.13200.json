    "abstract": "We study the implications of model uncertainty in a climate-economics framework with three types of capital: \"dirty\" capital that produces carbon emissions when used for production, \"clean\" capital that generates no emissions but is initially less productive than dirty capital, and knowledge capital that increases with R\\&D investment and leads to technological innovation in green sector productivity. To solve our high-dimensional, non-linear model framework we implement a neural-network-based global solution method. We show there are first-order impacts of model uncertainty on optimal decisions and social valuations in our integrated climate-economic-innovation framework. Accounting for interconnected uncertainty over climate dynamics, economic damages from climate change, and the arrival of a green technological change leads to substantial adjustments to investment in the different capital types in anticipation of technological change and the revelation of climate damage severity.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们在一个气候经济框架中研究了模型不确定性的影响，该框架涉及三种类型的资本：在生产过程中产生碳排放的\"脏\"资本，没有排放但起初不如\"脏\"资本效率高的\"清洁\"资本，以及随着研发投资增加并导致绿色部门生产力技术创新的知识资本。为了解决我们的高维非线性模型框架，我们实施了基于神经网络的全局解决方法。我们展示了模型不确定性对最优决策和社会估值在我们的整合气候经济创新框架中的一阶影响。考虑到气候动力学的相互依赖不确定性、气候变化带来的经济损害以及绿色技术变革的到来，会对不同类型的资本投资进行大幅调整，以应对技术变革和气候损害严重程度的揭示。",
