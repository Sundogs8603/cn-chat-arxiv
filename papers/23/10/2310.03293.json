    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLMs），如ChatGPT，由于其开放域生成能力，已被应用于各种自然语言处理任务。然而，将LLMs应用于对话任务存在两个问题：1.在对话过程中，用户可能有隐含的意图，这可能会被LLMs忽视，因此生成的回复可能与用户的意图不一致。2.对于LLMs来说，很难全面涵盖所有领域的知识。在某些特定领域中，它们的知识可能是不完整的，并且LLMs无法实时更新最新的知识。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个框架，即通过问问题检测用户隐含意图来增强对话生成的大型语言模型（LLM）代理（EDIT）。首先，EDIT根据对话上下文生成与用户意图相关的开放性问题；然后，EDIT通过与LLMs交互和在特定领域中搜索的方式来回答这些问题。",
