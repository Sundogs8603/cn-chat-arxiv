    "translated_abstract": "新材料的发现已经有着持续几个世纪乃至更长时间的推动人类进步的历史。材料的行为取决于其组成、结构和性质，而这些又依赖于其加工和测试条件。最近深度学习和自然语言处理的发展使得从出版的文献中（如同行评审出版物、图书和专利）大规模提取信息成为可能。然而，这些信息以不同的格式（如表格、文本和图像）展现，并且在报告样式上缺乏一致性，这引发了几个机器学习的挑战。在这里，我们讨论、量化和记录了材料科学文献自动信息提取方面的这些挑战，以期创建一个大型的材料科学知识库。具体而言，我们关注从文本和表格中进行信息提取，并举例说明了几个挑战。我们希望本研究能激发研究人员解决这些挑战。",
