    "translated_abstract": "关联规则挖掘技术在事务性数据库上的实现可以生成大量的顺序数据。从大量关联规则中提取洞察力被发现是一个具有挑战性的过程。当检查一组规则时，最基本的问题是如何高效地汇总和表示有意义的挖掘知识。许多算法和策略已经被开发出来来解决知识提取的问题；然而，这个过程的有效性可能受到数据结构的限制。更好的数据结构可以有效地影响知识提取过程的速度。本文提出了一种新的数据结构，称为规则前缀树，用于存储由关联规则挖掘生成的规则集。结果数据结构是一个由预先挖掘的规则组成的前缀树图结构。这个图将规则以路径的方式存储在前缀树中，类似的规则会互相覆盖。树中的每个节点表示一条规则。",
