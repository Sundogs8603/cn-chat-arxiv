    "translated_abstract": "由于复杂性和多样性模式的存在，时间序列异常检测是具有挑战性的。一个主要的困难在于建模时间相关的关系以寻找上下文异常，同时保持对点异常的检测准确性。在本文中，我们提出了一个无监督时间序列异常检测的框架，利用了基于点和序列的重构模型。基于点的模型试图量化点异常，而基于序列的模型试图量化点异常和上下文异常。在假设观察到的时间点是从一种标准时间点开始的两个阶段的偏离值的情况下，我们引入了一个由重构误差的组合值之比计算得出的命名分数。我们通过进一步整合命名分数和异常分数来导出感应异常分数，然后在特定条件下理论上证明了感应异常分数优于原始异常分数的优越性。",
