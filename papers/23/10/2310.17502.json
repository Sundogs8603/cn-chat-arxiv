    "abstract": "Customizing voice and speaking style in a speech synthesis system with intuitive and fine-grained controls is challenging, given that little data with appropriate labels is available. Furthermore, editing an existing human's voice also comes with ethical concerns. In this paper, we propose a method to generate artificial speaker embeddings that cannot be linked to a real human while offering intuitive and fine-grained control over the voice and speaking style of the embeddings, without requiring any labels for speaker or style. The artificial and controllable embeddings can be fed to a speech synthesis system, conditioned on embeddings of real humans during training, without sacrificing privacy during inference.",

    "translated_abstract": "在一个具有直观和精细控制的语音合成系统中定制声音和说话风格是具有挑战性的，因为很少有带有合适标签的数据可用。此外，编辑现有人的声音也涉及道德问题。本文提出了一种方法，可以生成不能与真实人类相关联的人工说话者嵌入，而且能够在嵌入的声音和说话风格上提供直观和精细的控制，而不需要任何说话者或风格的标签。这些人工可控的嵌入可以在训练期间与真实人类的嵌入条件下输入到语音合成系统中，在推理过程中不牺牲隐私。",
