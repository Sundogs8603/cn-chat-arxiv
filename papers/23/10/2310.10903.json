    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT的快速普及引发了关于其对人类写作的影响的争议。在对写作标准下降的担忧中，本研究调查了ChatGPT在学术写作中的作用，特别是在语言学习者中的作用。采用案例研究方法，本研究考察了博士生凯灵（Kailing）在整个学术写作过程中如何使用ChatGPT的经验。研究采用活动理论作为理论框架来理解利用生成式AI工具进行写作的过程，研究数据包括半结构化访谈、写作样本和GPT日志的分析。结果表明，凯灵在各个写作阶段有效地与ChatGPT合作，同时保留自己独特的作者声音和主体性。这突显了ChatGPT等AI工具在增强语言学习者的学术写作能力时不会掩盖个人的真实性。本案例研究对ChatGPT在学术界中的使用进行了批判性的探讨。",
