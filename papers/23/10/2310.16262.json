    "translated_abstract": "统计模型应准确反映分析师对变量及其关系的领域知识。尽管近期工具允许分析师表达这些假设并使用它们产生结果的统计模型，但是目前不清楚分析师想要表达什么以及外部化如何影响统计模型质量。本文填补了这些空白。我们首先进行了一项探索性研究，研究分析师使用特定领域语言（DSL）来表达概念模型。我们观察到分析师更倾向于详细描述变量之间的关系，并希望能够允许并稍后解决概念模型中的歧义。我们利用这些发现开发了rTisane，一种用于表达概念模型的DSL，并配合一个交互式消歧过程。在一项受控评估中，我们发现rTisane的DSL能帮助分析师更深入地参与并准确地外部化他们的假设。rTisane还能产生符合分析师假设的统计模型，保持分析师假设的一致性。",
