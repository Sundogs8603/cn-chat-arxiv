Spreadsheet software allows users to automatically format their tables by writing data-dependent conditional formatting (CF) rules. Writing such rules is often challenging for users as it requires them to understand and implement the underlying logic. We present FormaT5, a transformer-based model that can generate a CF rule given the target table and a natural language description of the desired formatting logic. We find that user descriptions for these tasks are often under-specified or ambiguous, making it harder for code generation systems to accurately learn the desired rule in a single step. To tackle this problem of under-specification and minimise argument errors, FormaT5 learns to predict placeholders though an abstention objective. These placeholders can then be filled by a second model or, when examples of rows that should be formatted are available, by a programming-by-example system",

    "translated_abstract": "表格的格式化是可视化、展示和分析中的重要属性。电子表格软件允许用户通过编写数据相关的条件格式规则来自动格式化表格。但对用户来说，编写这样的规则通常是具有挑战性的，因为它要求他们理解和实现底层逻辑。我们提出了一个基于转换器的模型FormaT5，可以根据目标表格和期望的格式逻辑的自然语言描述生成一个条件格式规则。我们发现，用户为这些任务提供的描述通常是不明确或含糊的，这使得代码生成系统难以在一步中准确学习到所需的规则。为了解决这个规范不足的问题并减少参数错误，FormaT5通过放弃目标的方式学习预测占位符。这些占位符可以由第二个模型或者当可用的行示例时，由一个基于示例的编程系统填充。",
