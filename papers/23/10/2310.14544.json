    "translated_abstract": "傅里叶特征逼近已经成功应用于可扩展的高斯过程（GP）回归中。尤其是基于高斯积分规则的积分傅里叶特征（QFF）近年来因其改进的近似精度和更好的校准不确定性估计而受到关注，相较于随机傅里叶特征（RFF）方法。然而，QFF的一个关键限制是其性能受到与高频振荡的积分相关的已知病态的影响，导致近似精度有限的特征。我们通过一种新的三角积分傅里叶特征（TQFF）方法来解决这个关键问题，该方法使用了一种特别适用于所需傅里叶变换的新颖非高斯积分规则。我们导出了TQFF的精确积分规则，并给出了对应特征映射的核逼近误差界。然后，我们展示了我们的方法相对于RFF和高斯QFF的改进性能。",
