    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习的漏洞检测取得了有希望的成果。然而，一个阻碍其在实践中非常有用的重要挑战是模型在扰动下不稳定，并且不能很好地泛化到超出分布（OOD）的数据，例如，在真实世界中将训练好的模型应用到未见过的项目上。我们假设这是因为模型学习到了非稳定的特征，例如变量名，与标签具有虚假相关性。当扰动和OOD数据集不再具有相同的虚假特征时，模型预测失败。为了解决这个挑战，在本文中，我们将因果性引入了深度学习漏洞检测中。我们的方法CausalVul分为两个阶段。首先，我们设计了新的扰动来发现模型可能用于进行预测的虚假特征。其次，我们在现有的深度学习模型之上应用了因果学习算法，特别是do-计算，来解决这个问题。",
