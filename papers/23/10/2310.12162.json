    "translated_abstract": "本立场文件在网络安全环境下探讨了人工智能的潜力，并特别强调了与意识相关的可能风险因素，这可以通过将人类专家纳入“人工智能-人类”协作中进行管理。随着人工智能技术的发展，它们将为攻击识别、事件响应和恢复提供无与伦比的机会。然而，成功将人工智能部署到网络安全措施中需要深入了解其能力、挑战以及与之相关的风险因素的道德和法律影响，以应对实际应用领域中的问题。为此，我们强调了一种平衡的方法，将人工智能的计算能力与人类专业知识结合起来。人工智能系统可以通过模式识别和预测建模主动发现漏洞并检测异常情况，极大提高识别速度和准确性。人类专家可以解释AI的输出结果，并提供领域专业知识的补充和辅助，从而增强整体的网络安全防护能力。",
