    "translated_abstract": "作为智能交通系统（ITS）的核心技术，交通流量预测具有广泛的应用。交通流量数据是时空数据，不仅与道路网络中的空间位置相关，而且随时间变化。现有方法在一定程度上解决了交通流量预测中的挑战，重点是有效建模时空依赖关系，但并未充分利用交通流量数据的所有固有属性。此外，对于时空数据挖掘的增量学习几乎没有尝试，以前的工作也很难转化到交通流量预测任务中。受到交通流量预测的增量学习方法挑战和道路网络固有属性的潜力未被充分利用的启发，我们提出了一种针对交通流量预测的交通枢纽感知时空自适应图转换器（H-STFormer）。具体而言，我们首先设计了一种新颖的空间自注意机制",
