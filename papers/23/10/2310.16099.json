    "translated_abstract": "半监督学习通过利用无标签数据来放宽对图像分割大规模像素级标注数据的需求。利用无标签数据的一个重要方法是对模型预测进行规范化。然而，由于无标签数据的预测可能不可靠，通常需要借助不确定性感知的方法逐渐学习有意义和可靠的预测。然而，不确定性估计方法依赖于模型预测的多次推断，每个训练步骤都需要计算，这在计算上是昂贵的。此外，这些不确定性图像捕捉像素级差异，并不能考虑全局信息。本研究提出了一种新的方法，通过利用分割掩模中的全局信息来估计分割不确定性。更确切地说，首先学习解剖学感知的表示来建模可用的分割掩模。然后，该学习表示将新的分割预测映射到一个解剖结构上。",
