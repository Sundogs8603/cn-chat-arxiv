    "title": "A New Weighted Food CPI from Scanner Big Data in China. (arXiv:2310.04242v1 [econ.GN])",
    "abstract": "Scanner big data has potential to construct Consumer Price Index (CPI). The study introduces a new weighted price index called S-FCPIw, which is constructed using scanner big data from retail sales in China. We address the limitations of China's CPI especially for its high cost and untimely release, and demonstrate the reliability of S-FCPIw by comparing it with existing price indices. S-FCPIw can not only reflect the changes of goods prices in higher frequency and richer dimension, and the analysis results show that S-FCPIw has a significant and strong relationship with CPI and Food CPI. The findings suggest that scanner big data can supplement traditional CPI calculations in China and provide new insights into macroeconomic trends and inflation prediction. We have made S-FCPIw publicly available and update it on a weekly basis to facilitate further study in this field.",

    "translated_abstract": "扫描仪大数据有潜力构建消费价格指数（CPI）。本研究介绍了一种新的加权价格指数S-FCPIw，该指数利用中国零售销售的扫描仪大数据构建。我们解决了中国CPI存在的高成本和及时性发布方面的局限性，并通过与现有价格指数的比较证明了S-FCPIw的可靠性。S-FCPIw不仅能更频繁和更丰富地反映商品价格的变动，而且分析结果显示S-FCPIw与CPI和食品CPI存在显著且强烈的关系。研究结果表明，扫描仪大数据可以补充中国传统的CPI计算方法，并为宏观经济趋势和通胀预测提供新的见解。我们已经公开了S-FCPIw并且每周更新，以促进该领域的进一步研究。",
