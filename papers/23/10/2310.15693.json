    "abstract": "Sharing cooking recipes is a great way to exchange culinary ideas and provide instructions for food preparation. However, categorizing raw recipes found online into appropriate food genres can be challenging due to a lack of adequate labeled data. In this study, we present a dataset named the ``Assorted, Archetypal, and Annotated Two Million Extended (3A2M+) Cooking Recipe Dataset\" that contains two million culinary recipes labeled in respective categories with extended named entities extracted from recipe descriptions. This collection of data includes various features such as title, NER, directions, and extended NER, as well as nine different labels representing genres including bakery, drinks, non-veg, vegetables, fast food, cereals, meals, sides, and fusions. The proposed pipeline named 3A2M+ extends the size of the Named Entity Recognition (NER) list to address missing named entities like heat, time or process from the recipe directions using two NER extraction tools. 3A2M+ dataset",

    "translated_abstract": "分享烹饪食谱是交流烹饪创意和提供食物制作指引的好方法。然而，将在线找到的原始食谱分类为适当的食物类型可能会很具有挑战性，因为缺乏足够的标注数据。在本研究中，我们提出了一个名为“混合、典型和注释的扩展两百万（3A2M+）烹饪食谱数据集”的数据集，其中包含两百万个被标记为相应类别的烹饪食谱，并提取了食谱描述中的扩展命名实体。这个数据集包括标题、命名实体识别、步骤和扩展命名实体等各种特征，以及代表糕点、饮料、非素食、蔬菜、快餐、谷物、主食、配菜和融合的九个不同类型的标签。所提出的名为3A2M+的流程通过使用两种命名实体识别工具，扩展了命名实体识别（NER）列表的大小，以解决从食谱步骤中缺少的命名实体，如加热、时间或过程。",
