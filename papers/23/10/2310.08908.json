    "abstract": "The large language model (LLM) has garnered significant attention due to its in-context learning mechanisms and emergent capabilities. The research community has conducted several pilot studies to apply LLMs to machine translation tasks and evaluate their performance from diverse perspectives. However, previous research has primarily focused on the LLM itself and has not explored human intervention in the inference process of LLM. The characteristics of LLM, such as in-context learning and prompt engineering, closely mirror human cognitive abilities in language tasks, offering an intuitive solution for human-in-the-loop generation. In this study, we propose a human-in-the-loop pipeline that guides LLMs to produce customized outputs with revision instructions. The pipeline initiates by prompting the LLM to produce a draft translation, followed by the utilization of automatic retrieval or human feedback as supervision signals to enhance the LLM's translation through in-context learning.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLM)因其上下文学习机制和新兴能力而受到广泛关注。研究界已经进行了几个试点研究，将LLM应用于机器翻译任务并从多个角度评估其性能。然而，以往的研究主要集中在LLM本身，还未探索人类在LLM推理过程中的干预。LLM具有上下文学习和提示工程等特点，与人类在语言任务中的认知能力密切相关，为人机协同生成提供了直观的解决方案。在本研究中，我们提出了一个人机协同的流程，通过修订指令引导LLM生成定制输出。该流程首先启动LLM生成草稿翻译，然后利用自动检索或人类反馈作为监督信号，通过上下文学习提升LLM的翻译质量。",
