    "translated_abstract": "最近的课程增强学习在解决复杂任务方面取得了显著进展，通过提出一系列代理任务的顺序来实现。然而，先前的方法在生成高维空间中的课程目标时经常面临挑战。因此，它们通常依赖于手动指定的目标空间。为了减轻这个限制并提高课程的可扩展性，我们提出了一种新的课程方法，它自动定义包含课程过程的关键信息的语义目标空间，并在其上提出课程目标。为了定义语义目标空间，我们的方法通过向量量化-变分自动编码器(VQ-VAE)将连续观察结果进行离散化，并通过图形恢复离散观察结果之间的时间关系。与此同时，我们的方法提出了不确定性和时间距离感知的课程目标，这些目标在自动组合的目标空间中收敛到最终目标。我们证明了所提出的方法",
