    "translated_abstract": "最近，通过体渲染学习神经隐式曲面已成为多视角重建的一种有前景的方法。然而，目前的方法存在精度有限和时间复杂度过高的瓶颈问题，亟需解决。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种称为Point-NeuS的新方法，利用点导向机制实现准确和高效的重建。点建模有机地嵌入到体渲染中，以增强和规范隐式曲面的表示。具体而言，为了实现精确的点导向和抗噪能力，建模了点云的随机不确定性，以捕捉噪声分布并估计点的可靠性。此外，引入了一个连接点和图像的神经投影模块，以向符号距离函数（SDF）添加几何约束。为了更好地补偿体渲染和点建模之间的几何偏差，对高保真度点进行了滤波处理。",
