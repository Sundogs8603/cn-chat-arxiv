    "translated_abstract": "自动做市商 (AMMs) 是去中心化金融中匹配流动性供给和需求的主要中心。它们的功能主要依赖于流动性提供者 (LPs) 将其资产投资于流动性池。然而，池中资产交易的价格通常比集中化和更流动的交易所价格延迟更多。这导致流动性提供者遭受套利损失。我们通过采用 Glosten 和 Milgrom 的经典市场微观结构模型，将市场价格适应于交易者行为，从而解决了这个问题。在本文中，我们提出了第一个最优贝叶斯和第一个无模型数据驱动算法来最优地跟踪资产的外部价格。我们使用的最优性概念在市场做市商的价格上强制执行了零利润条件，因此取名为 ZeroSwap。这确保了市场做市商在损失知情交易者的同时从噪声交易者那里获得利润。",
