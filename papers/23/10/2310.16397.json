    "abstract": "While complex simulations of physical systems have been widely used in engineering and scientific computing, lowering their often prohibitive computational requirements has only recently been tackled by deep learning approaches. In this paper, we present GraphSplineNets, a novel deep-learning method to speed up the forecasting of physical systems by reducing the grid size and number of iteration steps of deep surrogate models. Our method uses two differentiable orthogonal spline collocation methods to efficiently predict response at any location in time and space. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive collocation strategy in space to prioritize sampling from the most important regions. GraphSplineNets improve the accuracy-speedup tradeoff in forecasting various dynamical systems with increasing complexity, including the heat equation, damped wave propagation, Navier-Stokes equations, and real-world ocean currents in both regular and irregular domains.",

    "translated_abstract": "在工程和科学计算中，复杂的物理系统模拟被广泛应用，但它们常常需要耗费大量计算资源，近年来通过深度学习方法解决这个问题。本文提出了一种新颖的深度学习方法GraphSplineNets，通过减少深度替代模型的网格大小和迭代步数来加速物理系统的预测。我们的方法使用两种可微的正交样条插值方法，有效地预测任意时空位置的响应。此外，我们引入了自适应插值策略，以优先从最重要的区域进行采样。GraphSplineNets在预测不断复杂化的各种动态系统中，包括热方程、阻尼波传播、Navier-Stokes方程和真实世界海流，提高了准确度和速度的权衡，适用于规则和非规则域。",
