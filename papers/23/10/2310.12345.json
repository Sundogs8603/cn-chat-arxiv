    "abstract": "Deep Learning models have shown remarkable performance in a broad range of vision tasks. However, they are often vulnerable against domain shifts at test-time. Test-time training (TTT) methods have been developed in an attempt to mitigate these vulnerabilities, where a secondary task is solved at training time simultaneously with the main task, to be later used as an self-supervised proxy task at test-time. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised TTT technique based on the maximization of Mutual Information between multi-scale feature maps and a discrete latent representation, which can be integrated to the standard training as an auxiliary clustering task. Experimental results demonstrate competitive classification performance on different popular test-time adaptation benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型在各种视觉任务中展现出了显著的性能。然而，它们在测试时间经常受到域偏移的影响。为了减轻这些漏洞，已经开发了测试时间训练（TTT）方法，其中在训练时同时解决了一个次要任务和主任务，并在测试时作为自监督的代理任务使用。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于多尺度特征图和离散潜在表示之间的互信息最大化的新颖无监督TTT技术，该技术可以作为辅助聚类任务集成到标准训练中。实验结果表明，在不同的常见测试时间自适应基准上具有竞争性的分类性能。",
