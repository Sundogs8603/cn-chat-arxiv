    "translated_abstract": "数据增强通过生成伪数据已被证明在语法错误修正领域中缓解数据稀缺的挑战是有效的。已经广泛探索了各种增强策略，其中大部分是基于两个启发式的，即增加伪数据的分布相似性和多样性。然而，这些策略的有效性的基础机制仍不清楚。在本文中，我们旨在阐明数据增强如何改进语法错误修正模型。为此，我们引入了两个可解释且计算效率高的度量方法：亲和度和多样性。我们的研究发现，一个具有高亲和度和适当多样性的优秀语法错误修正数据增强策略能够更好地提高语法错误修正模型的性能。基于这一观察结果，我们提出了MixEdit，一种能够策略性和动态地增强真实数据而不需要额外的单语言数据的数据增强方法。",
