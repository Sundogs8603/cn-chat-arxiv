    "abstract": "arXiv:2310.05764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: A significant amount of protein function requires binding small molecules, including enzymatic catalysis. As such, designing binding pockets for small molecules has several impactful applications ranging from drug synthesis to energy storage. Towards this goal, we first develop HarmonicFlow, an improved generative process over 3D protein-ligand binding structures based on our self-conditioned flow matching objective. FlowSite extends this flow model to jointly generate a protein pocket's discrete residue types and the molecule's binding 3D structure. We show that HarmonicFlow improves upon state-of-the-art generative processes for docking in simplicity, generality, and average sample quality in pocket-level docking. Enabled by this structure modeling, FlowSite designs binding sites substantially better than baseline approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "大量蛋白质功能需要与小分子结合，包括酶催化。因此，为小分子设计结合口袋具有从药物合成到能量存储等多种影响深远的应用。为实现这一目标，我们首先开发了HarmonicFlow，这是一个改进的基于自调流匹配目标的3D蛋白质-配体结合结构生成过程。FlowSite将这种流模型扩展到联合生成蛋白质口袋的离散残基类型和分子的结合3D结构。我们展示了HarmonicFlow在口袋级对接中在简单性、普适性和平均样本质量上优于最先进的生成过程。借助于这种结构建模，FlowSite设计的结合位点明显优于基线方法。",
