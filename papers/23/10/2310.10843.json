    "translated_abstract": "密度估计是一类重要的概率机器学习问题，它用于估计数据的分布。其中一类密度估计器是混合模型，如通过期望最大化得到的高斯混合模型（GMM）。另一类密度估计器是生成模型，它们从输入的潜变量生成数据。其中一种生成模型是蒙特卡洛自回归流（MAF），它利用归一化流和自回归网络。本文中，我们将密度估计器用于分类，尽管它们通常用于估计数据的分布。我们使用密度估计器（具体来说是GMM和MAF）对数据的类别的似然进行建模。所提出的分类器优于仅使用单个高斯分布对似然进行建模的较简单的分类器，如线性判别分析。这项工作为提出基于联合密度估计的其他概率分类器开辟了研究空间。",
