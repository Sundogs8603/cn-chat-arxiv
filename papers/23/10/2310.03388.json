    "translated_abstract": "将深度学习模型从实验室环境迁移到开放世界，需要使它们能够处理未知条件。在一些应用中，部署过程中出现新的类别可能构成重大威胁，因此有效地检测它们至关重要。理想情况下，这种能力应该在需要时使用，而不需要在每个新任务中进行任何进一步的计算训练。过去几年中，超出分布检测引起了广泛关注，然而绝大多数研究都处理2D图像，忽视了现实世界中固有的3D特性，并经常混淆领域和语义的新颖性。在这项工作中，我们专注于后者，考虑由3D点云捕捉的物体几何结构，而不考虑特定领域。我们通过引入OpenPatch推动该领域的进展，它建立在一个大型预训练模型的基础上，简单地提取从其中间特征中描述每个已知类别的一组补丁表示。",
