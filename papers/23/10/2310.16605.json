    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了Web-DRO，一种基于网络结构进行聚类并在对比训练期间重新加权的无监督密集检索模型。具体而言，我们首先利用网络图链接并对锚点-文档对进行对比训练，训练一个嵌入模型用于聚类。然后，我们使用群组分布鲁棒优化方法来重新加权不同的锚点-文档对群组，这指导模型将更多权重分配给对比损失更高的群组，并在训练过程中更加关注最坏情况。在MS MARCO和BEIR上的实验表明，我们的模型Web-DRO在无监督场景中显著提高了检索效果。对聚类技术的比较表明，结合URL信息的网络图训练能达到最佳的聚类性能。进一步分析证实了群组权重的稳定性和有效性，表明了一致的模型偏好以及对有价值文档的有效加权。",
