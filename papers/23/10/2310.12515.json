    "translated_abstract": "匹配是在约束条件下为有限资源进行最优分配的一项基本技术，该任务可能具有不同的目标、条件和约束，然而，用于匹配的高效神经网络架构尚未充分研究。本文提出了一种新颖的图神经网络（GNN）WeaveNet，专门用于处理二分图。由于二分图通常是密集的，常规的GNN架构在深度堆叠时会过度平滑从而丢失节点信息，这对于解决匹配问题是不理想的。WeaveNet通过保留边信息并密集传递消息以达到更好的解决方案，避免了这种现象。为了评估模型，我们近似解决了一个强NP困难问题——公平稳定匹配。尽管这个问题固有困难，且网络是通用设计的，但我们的模型在性能上与专门设计用于稳定匹配的最新算法相当。",

By preserving edge information and densely passing messages, WeaveNet avoids the loss of node-wise information. The model achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art algorithms in the fair stable matching problem."
