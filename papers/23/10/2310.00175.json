    "translated_abstract": "给定一组感兴趣的点，体积跨度器是使用其中的一个子集可以用“小的”系数（在适当的范数中度量）表示所有点的方法。形式上，给定一组向量 $X = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$，目标是找到 $T \\subseteq [n]$，使得每个 $v \\in X$ 可以表示为 $\\sum_{i\\in T} \\alpha_i v_i$，其中 $\\|\\alpha\\|$ 较小。这个概念，也被称为良好条件的基，已经找到了几个应用，包括贝叶斯线性优化、行列式最大化和矩阵低秩逼近等。在本文中，我们给出了对于所有 $\\ell_p$ 范数的体积跨度器大小的几乎最优界限，并展示了它们可以通过简单的局部搜索过程构建。然后，我们展示了我们结果在其他任务中的应用，特别是在寻找最小体积包围椭球（MVEE）问题的核心集问题上。",
