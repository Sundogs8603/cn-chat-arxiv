    "abstract": "The fundamental problem in toxicity detection task lies in the fact that the toxicity is ill-defined. Jigsaw, a unit within Google and one of the leaders in the field, uses a definition of toxicity given by Dixon et al. - 'rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable language that is likely to make someone leave a discussion'. One can instantly see the issue with this definition, as it gives no quantitative measure of the toxicity and operates with highly subjective cultural terms. Despite all vagueness and flaws, this definition is de-facto widely used by many researchers. In this work we suggest quantative stress-based defenition for the toxicity that overcomes existing shortcomings.",

    "translated_abstract": "毒性检测任务中的根本问题在于毒性的定义模糊不清。谷歌旗下的团队Jigsaw是该领域的领导者之一，他们使用Dixon等人给出的毒性定义：“粗鲁、不尊重或不合理的语言，可能会让某人离开讨论”。人们可以立即看到这个定义的问题，因为它没有给出毒性的定量度量，而且涉及高度主观的文化术语。尽管存在模糊和缺陷，但这个定义已经成为许多研究者广泛采用的实际标准。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于定量压力的毒性定义，克服了现有的缺点。",
