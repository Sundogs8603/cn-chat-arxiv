    "translated_abstract": "最近在线性变换的Clifford几何不变量上引起了广泛关注。这引发了对一类在根系、反射群、李群和李代数的背景中感兴趣的几何变换的不变量的研究: Coxeter变换。我们对$A_8$、$D_8$和$E_8$的所有Coxeter变换进行了详尽的计算，并使用高性能计算机计算了它们的不变量。这种计算代数的范式生成了一个数据集，可以利用数据科学的技术，如监督和无监督机器学习来挖掘。本文重点研究神经网络分类和主成分分析。由于输出 - 不变量 - 完全由简单根的选择和Coxeter元素中对应反射的排列顺序决定，我们期望在映射中存在巨大的退化性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the machine learning approach for Clifford geometric invariants in linear transformations, focusing on ADE Coxeter elements. The authors perform calculations of Coxeter transformations and compute their invariants using high-performance computing. They utilize techniques from data science to analyze the generated dataset, particularly in the context of neural network classification and principal component analysis. The study highlights the significant degeneracy present in the mapping due to the dependence on the choice of simple roots and the permutation order of reflections in the Coxeter element."
