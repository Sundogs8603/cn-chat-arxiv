    "translated_abstract": "虽然经济理论解释了不同国家金融市场之间的关联，但经验研究主要通过Granger因果性来验证关联，而不考虑潜在变量或瞬时效应。他们的研究结果在金融市场之间的因果关系存在性方面存在不一致性，这可能归因于关注的市场、数据周期和应用的方法的差异。我们的研究采用因果发现方法，包括VAR-LiNGAM和LPCMCI，并结合领域知识，探索疫情后日本和美国金融市场之间的关联，而两国的货币政策方向存在分歧。VAR-LiNGAM的结果显示，前一天的美国市场对随后一天的日本股票和债券市场有影响，前一天的债券市场直接影响随后一天的外汇市场，间接影响随后一天的日本股票市场。",
