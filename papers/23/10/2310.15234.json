    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，一种从星系红移调查中限制宇宙学参数的有效方法是训练图神经网络进行场级别的无似然推断，而不对尺度进行剪切。具体而言，德桑蒂等人（2023年）开发了能够准确推断出通过仅包含星系位置和径向速度的目录来确定$\\Omega_{\\rm m}$值的模型，这些模型具有对天体物理和亚网格模型的不确定性具有鲁棒性。然而，观测受到许多效应的影响，包括1）掩蔽效应，2）特异速度和径向距离的不确定性，以及3）不同的星系选择。此外，观测只允许我们测量红移，纠缠了星系的径向位置和速度。在本文中，我们使用来自CAMELS项目中不同代码运行的最新水动力学模拟生成的星系目录来训练和测试我们的模型，这些模拟考虑了这些观测效应。",
