    "translated_abstract": "学习对下游任务有益的自监督图表示是具有挑战性的。在各种方法中，对比学习具有竞争力的性能。对比学习的嵌入被排列在一个超球面上，从而使得在欧几里德空间中的余弦距离测量成为可能。然而，许多领域的潜在几何结构，如图形，展现了高度非欧几里德的特性。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的对比学习框架，用于学习高质量的图嵌入。具体而言，我们设计了一种有效捕捉层次数据不变性信息的对齐度量，同时我们提出了一种替代均匀度量来防止所谓的维度塌陷。我们证明，在双曲空间中，必须解决与树的属性相关的叶子和高度层面的均匀性，而在双曲流形的环境空间中，这些概念转化为对同构性的施加。",
