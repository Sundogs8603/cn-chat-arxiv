    "translated_abstract": "准确检测口腔癌对于改善患者结果至关重要。然而，该领域面临两个关键挑战：缺乏专门针对口腔癌的基于深度学习的图像分割研究和缺乏注释数据。我们的研究提出了OCU-Net，一种创新的U-Net图像分割架构，专门设计用于在血红素与噪音(HE)染色图像数据集中检测口腔癌。OCU-Net采用了先进的深度学习模块，如通道和空间注意融合(CSAF)模块，这是一种强调HE图像中重要通道和空间区域并探索上下文信息的新颖创新特征。此外，OCU-Net还集成了其他创新组件，如挤压激活(SE)注意模块，空洞空间金字塔池化(ASPP)模块，残差块和多尺度融合。这些模块的融合在口腔癌分割的两个数据集中表现出卓越的性能。",
