    "abstract": "Automatic Keyphrase Extraction involves identifying essential phrases in a document. These keyphrases are crucial in various tasks such as document classification, clustering, recommendation, indexing, searching, summarization, and text simplification. This paper introduces a platform that integrates keyphrase datasets and facilitates the evaluation of keyphrase extraction algorithms. The platform includes BibRank, an automatic keyphrase extraction algorithm that leverages a rich dataset obtained by parsing bibliographic data in BibTeX format. BibRank combines innovative weighting techniques with positional, statistical, and word co-occurrence information to extract keyphrases from documents.
