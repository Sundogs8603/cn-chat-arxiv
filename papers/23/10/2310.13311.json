    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的非负球面松弛方法，用于具有唯一性约束的二进制矩阵优化问题，特别适用于多匹配和聚类。我们将相应的二进制矩阵约束松弛到（高维）非负球面上。为了优化我们的松弛问题，我们使用一种条件幂迭代方法来迭代改进目标函数，同时在与宇宙大小（或簇的数量）（间接）相关的连续标量参数上进行扫描。与现有的在优化之前需要固定整数宇宙大小的方法相反，我们的方法自动调整类似的连续参数。此外，虽然我们的方法与谱多匹配和谱聚类有一定相似之处，但我们的制定方案具有一个强大的优势，即我们不依赖额外的后处理过程来获得二进制结果。我们的方法在各种应用情况下显示出令人信服的结果。",
