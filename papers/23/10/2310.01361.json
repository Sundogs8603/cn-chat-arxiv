    "translated_abstract": "由于收集大量真实交互数据来训练通用机器人策略往往代价高昂，因此在数据生成方面通常采用模拟数据。然而，现有的数据生成方法通常专注于场景级别的多样性（例如对象实例和姿势），而忽视了任务级别的多样性，这是因为需要人工努力提出和验证新的任务。这导致在模拟数据上训练的策略很难展示显著的任务级别泛化能力。本文提出了一种通过利用大型语言模型（LLM）的基于场景和编码能力自动生成丰富的模拟环境和专家示范的方法，称为GenSim。我们的方法有两种模式：目标导向生成，其中将目标任务提供给LLM，LLM提出解决目标任务的任务课程；探索性生成，其中LLM从先前的任务中启动，并迭代地提出新的任务。",
