    "abstract": "The application of machine learning (ML) in a range of geospatial tasks is increasingly common but often relies on globally available covariates such as satellite imagery that can either be expensive or lack predictive power. Here we explore the question of whether the vast amounts of knowledge found in Internet language corpora, now compressed within large language models (LLMs), can be leveraged for geospatial prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that LLMs embed remarkable spatial information about locations, but naively querying LLMs using geographic coordinates alone is ineffective in predicting key indicators like population density. We then present GeoLLM, a novel method that can effectively extract geospatial knowledge from LLMs with auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap. We demonstrate the utility of our approach across multiple tasks of central interest to the international community, including the measurement of population density and economic livelihoods.

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在各种地理空间任务中的应用越来越普遍，但常常依赖于全球范围可用的卫星图像等预测变量，这可能要么很昂贵，要么缺乏预测能力。本文探讨了一个问题，即互联网语言语料库中包含的大量知识是否可以利用大型语言模型（LLM）进行地理空间预测任务。我们首先证明了LLM中嵌入了有关位置的显著空间信息，但仅使用地理坐标来查询LLM对于预测人口密度等关键指标是无效的。然后，我们提出了一种名为GeoLLM的新方法，可以有效地从LLM中提取地理空间知识，并结合来自OpenStreetMap的辅助地图数据。我们展示了我们的方法在多个国际社区关心的任务中的实用性，包括人口密度和经济生计的测量。在这些任务中",
