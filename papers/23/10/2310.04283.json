    "translated_abstract": "主成分分析（PCA）是数据分析中常用的工具，尤其是在高维数据情况下。PCA旨在找到由所谓“主成分”所张成的子空间，这些主成分最能解释数据集的方差。消除法是一种常用的元算法，用于发现这样的子空间，它从最重要的主成分开始顺序地找到每个主成分，直到找到较不重要的主成分。然而，由于其顺序性质，由于不完全估计主成分引入的数值误差 - 例如，由于此过程中的数值近似 - 会随着消除的进行而传播。据我们所知，这是第一篇在数学上对不精确消除法的误差传播进行了特性化的工作，这是本文的关键贡献。我们提供了两个主要结果：$ i）$当用于查找主要特征向量的子例程是泛型的时候，以及$ ii）$",
