    "translated_abstract": "分布式集成学习（DEL）涉及在分布式学习者中训练多个模型，然后结合它们的预测以提高性能。现有的相关研究集中在DEL算法设计和优化上，但忽视了激励这一重要问题，没有激励机制，自利学习者可能不愿参与DEL。我们旨在填补这一空白，提出了关于DEL激励机制设计的首个研究。我们提出的机制规定了具有异构计算和通信成本的学习者的训练数据量和奖励金额。一个设计挑战是准确理解学习者的多样性（即训练数据方面）如何影响集成准确性。为此，我们将集成准确性拆解为多样性-精确性权衡，以指导机制设计。另一个挑战是机制设计涉及解决具有大搜索空间的混合整数规划问题。为此，我们提出了一种新的快速求解算法，该算法通过同时考虑数据分布和通信成本来准确估计每个学习者的贡献。",

The mechanism specifies the amount of training data and reward for learners with different computation and communication costs. By decomposing ensemble accuracy into a tradeoff between diversity and precision, the mechanism design is guided. The study also presents a fast solution algorithm to accurately estimate the contribution of each learner."
