It automatically decomposes the given task into smaller, more manageable subtasks, and hence enables sparse decision-making and focused computation on the relevant parts of the environment. This relies on the extraction of an abstracted proxy problem represented as a directed graph, in which vertices and edges are learned end-to-end from hindsight. Our theoretical analyses provide performance guarantees under appropriate assumptions and establish where our approach is expected to be helpful. Generalization-focused experiments validate Skipper's significant advantage in zero-shot generalization, compared to existing state-of-the-art hierarchical planning methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "受到人类有意识规划的启发，我们提出了Skipper，这是一个利用时空抽象来推广在新情境中学到的技能的基于模型的强化学习代理。它自动将给定任务分解为更小、更可管理的子任务，从而实现稀疏决策和对环境相关部分的专注计算。这依赖于从回溯中学习得到的表示为有向图的抽象代理问题的提取。我们的理论分析在适当的假设下提供了性能保证，并确定了我们的方法在哪些方面有望提供帮助。针对泛化的实验验证了Skipper在零样本泛化方面与现有最先进的分层规划方法相比的显著优势。",
