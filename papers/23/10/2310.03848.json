    "abstract": "In most works on deep incremental learning research, it is assumed that novel samples are pre-identified for neural network retraining. However, practical deep classifiers often misidentify these samples, leading to erroneous predictions. Such misclassifications can degrade model performance. Techniques like open set recognition offer a means to detect these novel samples, representing a significant area in the machine learning domain.  In this paper, we introduce a deep class-incremental learning framework integrated with open set recognition. Our approach refines class-incrementally learned features to adapt them for distance-based open set recognition. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art incremental learning techniques and exhibits superior performance in open set recognition compared to baseline methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "在深度增量学习的研究中，大多数工作都假设新样本已经被预先识别，用于神经网络的重新训练。然而，实际的深度分类器经常误识别这些样本，导致错误的预测。这种错误分类会降低模型的性能。开放集识别等技术提供了一种检测这些新样本的方法，代表了机器学习领域的一个重要领域。本文介绍了一种集成了开放集识别的深度分类增量学习框架。我们的方法通过调整增量学习到的特征，使其适应基于距离的开放集识别。实验结果验证了我们的方法优于最先进的增量学习技术，并且在开放集识别方面表现出比基准方法更好的性能。",
