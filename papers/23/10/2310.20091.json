    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of the diverse and dynamic interests of users remains a significant challenge in the design of personalized recommender systems. Existing user modeling methods, like single-point and multi-point representations, have limitations w.r.t. accuracy, diversity, computational cost, and adaptability. To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce density-based user representations (DURs), a novel model that leverages Gaussian process regression for effective multi-interest recommendation and retrieval. Our approach, GPR4DUR, exploits DURs to capture user interest variability without manual tuning, incorporates uncertainty-awareness, and scales well to large numbers of users. Experiments using real-world offline datasets confirm the adaptability and efficiency of GPR4DUR, while online experiments with simulated users demonstrate its ability to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off by effectively utilizing model uncertainty.",

    "translated_abstract": "在设计个性化推荐系统中，准确建模用户的各种多样化和动态的兴趣仍然是一个重大挑战。现有的用户建模方法，如单点和多点表示，存在准确性、多样性、计算成本和适应性方面的局限性。为了克服这些不足，我们引入了一种新颖的模型——基于密度的用户表示(DURs)，它利用高斯过程回归实现有效的多兴趣推荐和检索。我们的方法GPR4DUR利用DURs来捕捉用户的兴趣变化，无需手动调整，同时具备不确定性感知能力，并且适用于大量用户的规模。使用真实世界的离线数据集进行的实验证实了GPR4DUR的适应性和效率，而使用模拟用户的在线实验则证明了它通过有效利用模型的不确定性，能够解决探索-开发的平衡问题。",
