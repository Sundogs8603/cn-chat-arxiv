    "abstract": "Accurate precipitation forecasting is a vital challenge of both scientific and societal importance. Data-driven approaches have emerged as a widely used solution for addressing this challenge. However, solely relying on data-driven approaches has limitations in modeling the underlying physics, making accurate predictions difficult. Coupling AI-based post-processing techniques with traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) methods offers a more effective solution for improving forecasting accuracy. Despite previous post-processing efforts, accurately predicting heavy rainfall remains challenging due to the imbalanced precipitation data across locations and complex relationships between multiple meteorological variables. To address these limitations, we introduce the PostRainBench, a comprehensive multi-variable NWP post-processing benchmark consisting of three datasets for NWP post-processing-based precipitation forecasting. We propose CAMT, a simple yet effective Channel Attention",

    "translated_abstract": "准确的降水预测是一项具有科学和社会重要性的重大挑战。数据驱动方法已经成为解决这个挑战的广泛采用的解决方案。然而，仅依赖数据驱动方法在模拟基础物理过程方面有限，使得准确预测困难。将基于人工智能的后处理技术与传统的数值天气预报（NWP）方法相结合，为提高预测准确性提供了更有效的解决方案。尽管之前进行过后处理的尝试，但由于不同位置的降水数据失衡和多个气象变量之间的复杂关系，准确预测大雨仍然具有挑战性。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了PostRainBench，这是一个全面的多变量NWP后处理基准，包括三个用于NWP后处理降水预测的数据集。我们提出了一种简单而有效的渠道注意力模型CAMT。",
