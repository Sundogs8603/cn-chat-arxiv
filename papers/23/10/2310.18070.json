    "abstract": "Multi-choice Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is a major and challenging task for machines to answer questions according to provided options. Answers in multi-choice MRC cannot be directly extracted in the given passages, and essentially require machines capable of reasoning from accurate extracted evidence. However, the critical evidence may be as simple as just one word or phrase, while it is hidden in the given redundant, noisy passage with multiple linguistic hierarchies from phrase, fragment, sentence until the entire passage. We thus propose a novel general-purpose model enhancement which integrates multi-grained evidence comprehensively, named Multi-grained evidence inferencer (Mugen), to make up for the inability. Mugen extracts three different granularities of evidence: coarse-, middle- and fine-grained evidence, and integrates evidence with the original passages, achieving significant and consistent performance improvement on four multi-choice MRC benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "多项选择机器阅读理解是机器根据给定的选项回答问题的一个重要且具有挑战性的任务。在多项选择机器阅读理解中，答案不能直接从给定的文章中提取出来，而实质上需要机器能够从准确的提取证据中进行推理。然而，关键的证据可能只是一个词或短语，而它却隐藏在给定的冗余、嘈杂的文章中，具有多个语言层级，从短语、片段、句子直到整个段落。因此，我们提出了一种新颖的通用模型增强方法，综合集成多样化的证据，称为多样化证据推理器（Mugen），以弥补这种能力的不足。Mugen提取了粗糙、中等和细粒度三种不同层次的证据，并将证据与原始段落结合起来，在四个多项选择机器阅读理解基准测试中实现了显著而一致的性能提升。",
