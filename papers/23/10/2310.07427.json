    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种名为Quantum Gramian Angular Field (QGAF)的时间序列预测方法。该方法将量子计算技术与深度学习相结合，旨在提高时间序列分类和预测的精度。通过设计特定的量子电路，我们成功地将股票回报时间序列数据转化为适合卷积神经网络（CNN）训练的二维图像。与经典的Gramian Angular Field (GAF)方法不同，QGAF的独特之处在于消除了数据归一化和反余弦计算的需求，简化了从时间序列数据到二维图像的转换过程。为了验证该方法的有效性，我们在中国A股市场、香港股市和美国股市的数据集上进行了实验。实验结果表明，与经典的GAF方法相比，QGAF方法显著改善了预测性能。",
