    "translated_abstract": "演示学习（LfD）是一个允许普通用户轻松编程机器人的框架。然而，机器人学习的效率以及机器人对任务变化的泛化能力取决于提供的演示的质量和数量。我们的目标是指导人类教师提供更有效的演示，从而促进机器人的高效学习。为了实现这一目标，我们提出使用不确定性的度量，即与任务相关的信息熵，作为向人类教师建议信息丰富的演示示例的准则，以提高他们的教学技能。在一项实验中（N=24），我们使用增强现实（AR）引导系统来训练新手用户从工作空间中具有最高熵的区域产生额外的演示。这些新手用户经过几次试验，教机器人使用有限数量的演示来完成一个可泛化的任务。随后，在训练后评估用户的表现",
