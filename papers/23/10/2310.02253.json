Here, we study five key aspects of trade in digital products by introducing a novel dataset on the exports and imports of digital products. First, we show that compared to trade in physical goods, the origin of digital products exports is more spatially concentrated. Second, we show that between 2016 and 2021 trade in digital products grew faster than physical trade, at an annualized growth rate of 20% compared to 6% for physical trade. Third, we show that trade in digital products is large enough to partly offset some important trade balance estimates, like the physical trade deficit of the United States. Fourth, we show that countries that have decoupled economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions have larger and faster growing exports in digital product sectors.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管全球努力协调国际贸易统计数据，我们对数字产品的贸易及其影响的理解仍然不清楚。在这里，我们通过引入一个新的数字产品出口和进口数据集，研究数字产品贸易的五个关键方面。首先，我们表明与实物商品贸易相比，数字产品出口的起源更加空间集中。其次，我们表明在2016年至2021年之间，数字产品贸易增长速度快于实物贸易，年均增长率为20%，而实物贸易为6%。第三，我们表明数字产品贸易规模足够大，可以在一定程度上抵消一些重要的贸易平衡估计，如美国的实物贸易逆差。第四，我们表明那些将经济增长与温室气体排放分离的国家，在数字产品领域拥有较大且增长更快的出口。最后，我们将数字产品纳入经济复杂性的衡量指标中。",
