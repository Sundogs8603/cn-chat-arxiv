    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了深度学习技术在联合声音信号分类和定位网络中的应用。目前最先进的声源定位深度学习网络在其架构中缺乏特征聚合。特征聚合通过使来自不同特征尺度的信息整合，提高模型性能，从而改善特征的鲁棒性和不变性。这在SSL网络中尤为重要，SSL网络必须区分直接和间接声音信号。为了弥补这一差距，我们从计算机视觉神经网络中借鉴了特征聚合技术，将其应用在信号检测神经网络中。此外，我们提出了尺度编码网络（SEN）用于特征聚合，以编码来自不同尺度的特征，压缩网络以实现更高效的聚合。为了评估特征聚合在SSL网络中的有效性，我们集成了以下计算机视觉特征聚合实验。",
