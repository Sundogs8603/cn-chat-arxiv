    "translated_abstract": "良好的姿势和形式对于安全和高效的运动至关重要。即使在健身房环境下，教练可能无法及时提供反馈。因此，康复疗法和健身训练可以从提供实时评估的推荐系统中受益。本文提出了一种算法流程，可以在实时环境中对运动技术中的问题进行诊断，并给出矫正建议，具有高敏感性和特异性。我们使用MediaPipe进行姿势识别，使用峰值突出检测计算重复次数，并使用可学习的物理模拟器跟踪每个运动的动作演变。根据与典型学习动作的偏差，基于统计学习对测试视频进行诊断。该系统在六个全身和上半身运动上进行了评估。通过低成本设备如智能手机提供的实时建议，运动者可以纠正潜在的错误，使自我练习成为可能，同时降低受伤风险。",
