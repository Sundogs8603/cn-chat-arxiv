    "translated_abstract": "为了提高乳腺肿瘤分割模型的泛化能力，并改进对小尺寸、低对比度和不规则形状乳腺肿瘤的分割性能，我们提出了一种渐进双先验网络（PDPNet），用于从不同机构采集的动态增强磁共振图像（DCE-MRI）中分割乳腺肿瘤。PDPNet首先通过粗分割定位模块裁剪肿瘤区域，然后使用弱语义先验和跨尺度相关先验知识逐步改进乳腺肿瘤掩膜。为了验证PDPNet的有效性，我们将其与几种最先进的方法在多中心数据集上进行了比较。结果表明，与亚优化方法相比，PDPNet的DSC、SEN、KAPPA和HD95分别提高了3.63％、8.19％、5.52％和3.66％。此外，通过消融实验证明了所提出的定位模块可以减少正常组织的影响。",
