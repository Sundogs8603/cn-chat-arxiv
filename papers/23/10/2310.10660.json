    "translated_abstract": "网络攻击的增加给安全造成了重大威胁。研究人员提出了用于支持相关领域研究的网络攻击数据集。基于这些数据集，提出了许多攻击检测方法。然而，我们发现在攻击之间存在着行为属性重叠的显著现象，即数据集中存在多个具有相同特征但不同标签的样本。在本文中，我们验证了这一现象并重新标注了一些知名数据集（如UNSW-NB15、CCCS-CIC-AndMal-2020）。此外，以多标签方式检测网络攻击可以获得更多信息，为追踪攻击源和构建入侵检测系统提供支持。因此，我们提出了基于深度学习的多标签检测模型MLD-Model，其中采用Wassers值函数进行训练。",
