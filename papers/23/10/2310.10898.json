    "translated_abstract": "社区检测是计算科学中的一个基本问题，在各个领域都有应用。通常通过最大化一个目标函数（模块性）在网络节点的划分上来检测社区。我们的研究探讨了不同模块化最大化算法在实现最优划分方面的性能。我们使用了104个网络，包括来自不同背景的真实世界实例和具有模块化结构的合成图。我们分析了十种近似模块化算法，对比了一种精确的基准线方法，该方法是一种精确的整数规划方法，可以全局优化模块性。分析的十种算法包括八个启发式算法，两种图神经网络算法的变种，以及几种Bayan近似算法的变种。我们的分析揭示了最常用的模块化方法得到的划分与网络的最优划分之间的显著差异，如下所示。",
