    "translated_abstract": "细胞的检测和跟踪对于生物分析至关重要。最近的方法依赖于基于模型演进的跟踪，通常通过训练端到端的深度学习模型来在图像帧上检测和跟踪细胞，并取得了令人满意的结果。然而，这些方法需要大量的标注数据，而获取这些数据耗时且需要专业的标注员。本文提出了一种基于经典检测方法的新方法，可以减轻对标注数据的需求。具体来说，它将细胞形状近似为定向椭圆，然后使用通用定向对象检测器来识别每个帧中的细胞。然后，我们依靠一个全局数据关联算法，使用概率距离度量来探索细胞的时间相似性，考虑到椭圆与二维高斯分布的关系。我们的结果表明，我们的方法能够实现具有竞争力的检测和跟踪结果。",
