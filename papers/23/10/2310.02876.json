    "abstract": "A growing body of work has focused on text classification methods for detecting the increasing amount of hate speech posted online. This progress has been limited to only a select number of highly-resourced languages causing detection systems to either under-perform or not exist in limited data contexts. This is majorly caused by a lack of training data which is expensive to collect and curate in these settings. In this work, we propose a data augmentation approach that addresses the problem of lack of data for online hate speech detection in limited data contexts using synthetic data generation techniques. Given a handful of hate speech examples in a high-resource language such as English, we present three methods to synthesize new examples of hate speech data in a target language that retains the hate sentiment in the original examples but transfers the hate targets. We apply our approach to generate training data for hate speech classification tasks in Hindi and Vietnamese. Our find",

    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的研究关注于文本分类方法，以便检测网上发布的越来越多的仇恨言论。这一进展仅限于一些资源充足的语言，导致在有限数据环境中检测系统性能不佳或根本不存在。这主要是由于这些环境中获取和整理训练数据的成本较高所致。在本研究中，我们提出了一种数据增强方法，通过合成数据生成技术解决了有限数据环境中在线仇恨言论检测中缺乏数据的问题。在某些资源丰富的语言（如英语）中给定一些仇恨言论示例，我们提出了三种方法来合成保留原始示例中仇恨情绪但转移仇恨对象的新的仇恨言论数据示例。我们将这种方法应用于生成用于印地语和越南语的仇恨言论分类任务的训练数据。",
