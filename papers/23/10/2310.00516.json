    "translated_abstract": "恶意软件通过破坏系统和数据给个人、组织和关键基础设施带来严重的安全风险。利用提供计算机内存快照的内存转储可以帮助分析和检测恶意内容，包括恶意软件。为了提高恶意软件分类系统的效力并解决隐私问题，特征选择可以起到关键作用，因为它能够识别出最相关的特征，从而最小化分类器所需的数据量。在本研究中，我们采用三种特征选择方法从内存内容中识别出重要特征，并将它们与多样的分类器一起使用，以提高分类任务的性能和隐私保护。我们在三个级别的恶意软件分类任务上进行了全面的实验：i）二元级别的良性软件或恶意软件分类，ii）恶意软件类型分类（包括木马、勒索软件和间谍软件），和iii）恶意软件家族分类。",
