    "translated_abstract": "针对随机变量的统计评估是设计更好的环境管理和恢复方案的主要议题。对于水质指标、洪涝和干旱水位等这些变量的上下界估计都很重要，应当在一个统一的数学框架中进行一致的评估。我们提出了一种新型的Orlicz后悔方法，用于一致地界定随机变量的统计量上下界。这里的一致性指的是上界和下界使用相同的系数和参数值进行评估，与迄今为止提出的某些风险度量不同。Orlicz后悔能够根据随机变量的尾行为灵活地评估其统计量。我们通过明确地将Orlicz后悔与发散风险度量联系起来，以更好地理解它们。我们得到了将Orlicz后悔和发散风险度量等效的充分条件。",

Different from traditional methods, this approach adopts a consistent evaluation and provides sufficient conditions for equivalence with divergence risk measures."
