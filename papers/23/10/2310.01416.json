    "translated_abstract": "异常扩散存在于从原子到大尺度的所有尺度上。一些典型的系统包括：超冷原子、细胞核中的端粒、水分在水泥基材料中的传输、节肢动物的自由运动和鸟类的迁徙模式。对扩散的表征提供了关于这些系统动力学的重要信息，并提供了一个跨学科的框架来研究扩散传输。因此，识别潜在的扩散机制并以高置信度推断异常扩散指数{$\\alpha$}的问题对物理学、化学、生物学和生态学来说至关重要。在异常扩散挑战赛中，将机器学习技术和从轨迹中提取的统计信息相结合的原始轨迹的分类和分析已被广泛研究。我们在这里提出了一种新的数据驱动方法来处理扩散轨迹。该方法利用了Gramian Angular Fields (GAF)",
