    "translated_abstract": "最好的编码是具有可解释性的。在本研究中，我们引入了一种新颖的模型，在变分自编码器（VAE）的初期引入了一个可解释的瓶颈，称为滤波器组（FB）。这种安排迫使VAE关注输入信号中最有信息的片段，促进了新编码f_0的学习，使其在传统的潜变量空间上具有增强的可解释性和聚类能力。通过有意地约束VAE使用这个滤波器组，我们有意地限制了它访问广泛输入域信息的能力，促进了一个可辨识、可分离且降低维度的编码的发展。f_0的进化学习轨迹进一步表现为一个动态的分层树，提供了对聚类相似性的深刻洞察。此外，为了处理复杂的数据配置，我们提出了一个与滤波器组结构对称对齐的定制解码器结构。",
