This work takes an initial step towards exploring the less researched topic of how neural models discover linguistic properties of words, such as gender, as well as the rules governing their usage. We propose to use an artificial corpus generated by a PCFG based on French to precisely control the gender distribution in the training data and determine under which conditions a model correctly captures gender information or, on the contrary, appears gender-biased.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多研究已经证明神经语言模型在没有直接监督的情况下能够学习各种语言属性。本文首次着手探索神经模型如何发现单词的语言属性（如性别）以及规则的使用方法，这是一个相对少有研究的话题。我们提出使用由基于法语的PCFG生成的人工语料库，精确控制训练数据中的性别分布，并确定模型在哪种条件下能正确捕捉到性别信息，或者相反，显示出性别偏见。",

The study investigates whether the models accurately capture gender information or exhibit gender bias under different conditions."
