    "translated_abstract": "数字健康工具具有显著改善医疗服务传递的潜力。然而，由于可用性和信任方面的挑战，它们的使用仍然相对有限。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）作为具有处理复杂信息和生成人类质量文本能力的通用模型出现，为医疗保健领域提供了丰富的潜在应用。直接在临床环境中应用LLMs并不简单，因为LLMs容易提供不一致或无意义的答案。我们展示了如何利用外部工具使LLMs在临床医疗技术互动中提供全新界面。这增强了数字医疗工具和AI模型的实用性和实际影响，同时解决了在临床环境中使用LLMs的当前问题，如幻觉。我们通过心血管疾病和糖尿病风险预测的例子阐述了我们的方法，并突出了其中的好处。",
