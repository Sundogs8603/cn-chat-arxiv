    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLM）展示了解决各种任务的出色能力。然而，尽管它们在各种任务中取得了成功，但目前还没有研究它们在生物医学领域的能力。因此，本文旨在评估LLMs在基准生物医学任务上的性能。为此，我们对6个不同生物医学任务的26个数据集中的4个热门LLMs进行了综合评估。据我们所知，这是第一篇在生物医学领域对各种LLMs进行广泛评估和比较的研究。有趣的是，根据我们的评估，我们发现在训练集较小的生物医学数据集中，零样本LLMs甚至超过了当前最先进的精调生物医学模型。这表明在大型文本语料库上进行预训练使LLMs在生物医学领域具备了很强的专业能力。我们还发现，在所有任务中没有一个LLM能够胜过其他LLMs。",
