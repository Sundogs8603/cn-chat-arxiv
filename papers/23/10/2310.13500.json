    "abstract": "Analogical proportions are statements of the form \"$a$ is to $b$ as $c$ is to $d$\", which expresses that the comparisons of the elements in pair $(a, b)$ and in pair $(c, d)$ yield similar results. Analogical proportions are creative in the sense that given 3 distinct items, the representation of a 4th item $d$, distinct from the previous items, which forms an analogical proportion with them can be calculated, provided certain conditions are met. After providing an introduction to analogical proportions and their properties, the paper reports the results of an experiment made with a database of animal descriptions and their class, where we try to \"create\" new animals from existing ones, retrieving rare animals such as platypus. We perform a series of experiments using word embeddings as well as Boolean features in order to propose novel animals based on analogical proportions, showing that word embeddings obtain better results.",

    "translated_abstract": "模拟比例是形式为“$a$对$b$如同$c$对$d$”的陈述，表达了元素对$(a,b)$和对$(c,d)$的比较得出相似结果。模拟比例是创造性的，因为在给定3个不同的项目的情况下，可以根据一定条件计算出与之前的项目不同的第4个项目$d$的表示，使其与之形成模拟比例。在介绍模拟比例及其特性后，论文报告了使用动物描述和类别的数据库进行的实验结果，我们试图从现有动物中“创造”新的动物，如鸭嘴兽等罕见动物。我们进行了一系列的实验，使用词嵌入和布尔特征来基于模拟比例提出新的动物，结果表明词嵌入获得更好的结果。",
