    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLM)凭借其生成能力，已成为创意过程中的无价工具。这些模型能够产生数百甚至数千个视觉和文本输出，为创意努力提供了丰富的灵感。但我们是否充分发挥了它们的潜力？我们认为当前的交互范式存在不足之处，将用户引导到有限的一组想法上，而不是赋予他们探索生成模型中广阔的潜在设计空间的能力。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个框架，促进了设计空间的结构化生成，用户可以无缝地探索、评估和综合多种响应。通过设计和开发一个交互系统Luminate，并与8名专业作家进行用户研究，我们证明了该框架的可行性和实用性。我们的工作推进了我们与LLM在创意任务中的交互方式，引入了一种探索其潜力的方法。",
