    "translated_abstract": "通过基于三维刚体运动（即SE(3)群）的流匹配范式，我们引入了一系列具有不断增强建模能力的新型生成模型：FoldFlow，从而实现了对蛋白质主链的准确建模。首先，我们介绍了FoldFlow-Base，一种无需模拟的学习确定性连续时间动力学和匹配不变目标分布的方法。接下来，我们通过引入Riemannian最优传输来加速训练，创建了FoldFlow-OT，从而构建了更简单和稳定的流。最后，我们设计了FoldFlow-SFM，将Riemannian最优传输和无需模拟训练相结合，可以学习SE(3)上的随机连续时间动力学。我们的FoldFlow生成模型家族相比之前的方法具有几个关键优势。",
