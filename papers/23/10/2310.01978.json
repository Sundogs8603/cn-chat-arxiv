    "abstract": "This paper investigates the use of computational tools and Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques for verifying online multimedia content, with a specific focus on real-world cases from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Over a nine-month period from April to December 2022, we examine verification workflows, tools, and case studies published by \\faktiskbar. Our study showcases the effectiveness of diverse resources, including AI tools, geolocation tools, internet archives, and social media monitoring platforms, in enabling journalists and fact-checkers to efficiently process and corroborate evidence, ensuring the dissemination of accurate information. This research underscores the vital role of computational tools and OSINT techniques in promoting evidence-based reporting and combatting misinformation. We also touch on the current limitations of available tools and prospects for future developments in multimedia verification.",
