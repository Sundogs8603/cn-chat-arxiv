    "translated_abstract": "现代扩散模型在学习复杂的高维数据分布方面取得了成功，这部分归功于其能够构建具有解析转移核函数和评分函数的扩散过程。这种可追溯性结果在不需要模拟的框架中具有稳定的回归损失，从而可以学习到可以扩展的逆向生成过程。然而，当数据被限制在受限制集合而不是标准的欧几里得空间中时，根据之前的尝试，这些理想的特性似乎丧失了。在这项工作中，我们提出了镜像扩散模型（MDM），一种新的扩散模型类，可以在凸约束集合上生成数据而不丧失任何可追溯性。这是通过在从镜像映射构建的对偶空间中学习扩散过程来实现的，关键的是，这是一个标准的欧几里得空间。我们推导了流行的约束集合（如单纯形和$\\ell_2$-球）的镜像映射的有效计算，显示明显的提升。",
