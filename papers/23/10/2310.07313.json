    "abstract": "Retrosynthesis involves determining a sequence of reactions to synthesize complex molecules from simpler precursors. As this poses a challenge in organic chemistry, machine learning has offered solutions, particularly for predicting possible reaction substrates for a given target molecule. These solutions mainly fall into template-based and template-free categories. The former is efficient but relies on a vast set of predefined reaction patterns, while the latter, though more flexible, can be computationally intensive and less interpretable. To address these issues, we introduce METRO (Molecule-Edit Templates for RetrOsynthesis), a machine-learning model that predicts reactions using minimal templates - simplified reaction patterns capturing only essential molecular changes - reducing computational overhead and achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "溯源涉及确定从简单前体合成复杂分子的一系列反应。由于这在有机化学中是一个挑战，机器学习提供了解决方案，特别是用于预测给定目标分子的可能反应底物。这些解决方案主要分为基于模板和基于非模板两类。前者高效但依赖于大量预定义的反应模式，而后者虽然更灵活，但计算开销大且解释性较差。为解决这些问题，我们引入了METRO（用于溯源合成的分子编辑模板），这是一个利用最小模板进行反应预测的机器学习模型，简化了反应模式，减少了计算开销，并在标准基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。",
