    "translated_abstract": "加密货币能够在没有中央机构的情况下实现安全的数字资产转移，因此引起了越来越多的关注。随着全球和土耳其投资者数量的增加，可以明显看出在金融波动面前，对数字资产的兴趣将持续增长。然而，消费者在购买加密货币时是否认为区块链技术易于使用和有用性仍存在不确定性。本研究旨在通过考虑客户服务质量、降低成本、效率和可靠性等因素，来解释区块链技术在加密货币购买中的易于使用和有用性。为了实现这个目标，我们从土耳其不同地区对加密货币感兴趣的463个参与者那里获取了数据，并使用SPSS Process Macro程序进行分析。分析结果表明，感知易于使用和有用性介导了客户服务、降低成本、效率和可靠性的影响。",
