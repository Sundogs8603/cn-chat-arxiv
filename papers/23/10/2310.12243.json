    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型，如自动驾驶车辆中使用的模型，对于对抗攻击是脆弱的，攻击者可以在环境中放置对抗性物体，从而导致误分类。虽然在数字空间中生成这些对抗性物体已被广泛研究，但是成功地将这些攻击从数字领域转移到现实领域在控制现实世界环境因素方面仍然具有挑战性。鉴于这些限制，我们介绍了REVAMP，一个易于使用的Python库，它是首个为创建具有任意对象的攻击场景并模拟真实环境因素、光照、反射和折射的工具。REVAMP使研究人员和实践者能够通过提供广泛可配置的选项来设计实验并使用可微渲染来复现物理上可信的对抗性物体，从而迅速探索数字领域中的各种场景。",
