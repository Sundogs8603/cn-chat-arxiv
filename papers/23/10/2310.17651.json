We give efficient algorithms for solving this problem, as well as a number of applications that stem from choosing an appropriate set of conditioning events.  For example, we can efficiently make predictions targeted at polynomially many decision makers, giving each of them optimal swap regret if they best-respond to our predictions. We generalize this to online combinatorial optimization, where the decision makers have a very large action space, to give the first algorithms offering polynomially many decision makers no regret on polynomially many subsequences that may depend on their actions and the context. We apply these results to get efficient no-subsequence-regret algorithms in extensive-form games (EFGs), yielding a new family of regret guara",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在对抗选择的高维状态下进行预测的问题，这些预测在任意条件事件下都是无偏的，并旨在根据后续决策制定合适的事件。我们提出了解决这个问题的有效算法，并且给出了一些应用，这些应用来自于选择一个合适的条件事件集合。例如，我们可以高效地为多项式数量的决策制定者制定预测，如果他们对我们的预测做出了最佳反应，每个决策制定者都具有最优的交换后悔。我们将这一理论推广到在线组合优化领域，决策制定者具有非常大的行动空间，在这个领域中，我们首次提出了算法，在多项式数量的子序列上实现了多项式数量的决策制定者的无后悔性，这些子序列可能依赖于他们的行动和上下文。我们将这些结果应用到广义博弈中获得了高效的无子序列后悔算法，从而产生了一类新的后悔保证算法。",
