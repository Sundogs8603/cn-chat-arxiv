    "translated_abstract": "在电子商务零售领域，减少最后一公里交付阶段的包裹丢失是一个重要目标。包括产品、客户和订单信息在内的数据的不断增加使得机器学习在包裹丢失预测中的应用成为可能。然而，数据中存在的天然不平衡问题（即只有极少部分包裹丢失）带来了重大挑战。在本文中，我们提出了两种机器学习方法，即数据平衡与有监督学习（DBSL）和深度混合集成学习（DHEL），以准确预测包裹丢失。这些预测的实际意义在于帮助电子商务零售商优化与保险相关的决策政策。我们使用比利时货运的一年数据对所提出的机器学习模型进行了全面评估。研究结果表明，DHEL模型（将前馈自动编码器与随机森林集成方法相结合）的表现最佳。",
