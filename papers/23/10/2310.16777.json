In this work, we propose a novel architecture called MixerFlow, based on the MLP-Mixer architecture, further unifying the generative and discriminative modelling architectures. MixerFlow offers an effective mechanism for weight sharing for flow-based models. Our results demonstrate better density estimation on image datasets under a fixed computational budget and scales well as the image resolution increases, making MixeFlow a powerful yet simple alternative to the Glow-based architectures.

    "translated_abstract": "正则化流是一种统计模型，通过使用双射变换将复杂密度转换为简单密度，实现了密度估计和从单个模型生成数据的功能。在图像建模的背景下，主要选择的是基于Glow的架构，而其他架构在研究界尚未得到广泛探索。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于MLP-Mixer架构的新型架构MixerFlow，进一步统一了生成性和判别性建模架构。MixerFlow提供了一种有效的权重共享机制，适用于基于流的模型。我们的结果表明，在固定计算预算下，MixerFlow在图像数据集上具有更好的密度估计性能，并且随着图像分辨率的增加，其性能也得到了良好的扩展，使得MixerFlow成为Glow-based架构的一个强大而简单的替代品。我们还展示了MixerFlow提供了比Glow-based架构更丰富的嵌入表示。",
