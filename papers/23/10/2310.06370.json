    "translated_abstract": "几种深度学习算法已经在现有的物体检测任务中展现出惊人的性能，但是识别较暗的物体是最大的挑战。此外，这些技术在检测方面遇到困难或者识别速度较慢，导致性能损失明显。因此，需要一种改进的、准确的检测方法来解决上述困难。本研究提出了一种基于脉冲和普通卷积层的能效高、可靠的物体检测模型。该模型分为两个部分。第一部分是特征提取器，利用预训练的VGG16模型。提案结构的第二部分是脉冲和普通卷积层的组合，用于检测图像的边界框。我们使用预训练模型对检测到的物体进行分类。使用最先进的Python库，可以高效地训练脉冲层。所提出的脉冲卷积物体检测器模型在黑色物体检测上表现出优秀的性能。",
