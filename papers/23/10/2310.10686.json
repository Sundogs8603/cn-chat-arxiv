    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型在先进的提示技术下表现出了出色的推理能力，但在需要探索、战略预见和顺序决策的任务中表现不足。最近的研究提出利用外部程序定义搜索逻辑，使得语言模型可以执行被动的树搜索来解决更具挑战性的推理任务。虽然取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但这些方法存在若干基本限制。首先，被动的树搜索不高效，通常需要多轮语言模型API调用来解决单个问题。此外，被动搜索方法不灵活，需要特定任务的程序设计。然后一个自然的问题出现：我们是否可以在没有外部程序的辅助下保持语言模型的树搜索能力，仍然能够生成清晰展示树结构搜索过程的响应？为此，我们提出了一个新的概念，称为自主树搜索能力。",
