    "translated_abstract": "双曲图卷积网络（HGCN）在提取分层图信息方面展示了巨大潜力。然而，由于昂贵的双曲操作和随着深度增加的过度平滑问题，现有的HGCN受限于浅层架构。尽管在GCNs中已经应用了一些方法来减轻过度平滑问题，但是开发双曲治疗方法面临着不同的挑战，因为操作必须经过精心设计以适应双曲性质。解决以上挑战，本文提出了DeepHGCN，这是第一个具有显著提高计算效率和大大减轻过度平滑效果的深层多层HGCN架构。DeepHGCN具有两个深层HGCN的关键因素：（1）一种新颖的双曲特征转换层，能够实现快速而准确的线性映射；（2）通过有效的双曲残差连接和权重和特征的正则化技术来促进。",
