    "translated_abstract": "关于什么构成适当的自然语言生成（NLG）系统行为的公平相关假设，从不变性，即期望系统对社会群体做出相同的响应，到适应性，即期望系统在不同社会群体之间产生不同响应，存在不同观点。我们设计并进行了五个案例研究，通过扰动不同类型的与身份相关的语言特征（姓名、角色、地点、方言和风格）来阐明不变性和适应性之间的紧张关系。我们概述了人们对系统行为的期望，并提出了这两种对立但常见的假设的潜在警示。我们发现适应的动机包括社会规范、文化差异、特定特征信息和适应性；不变性的动机包括支持规定主义的观点、将适应视为 NLG 系统难以适当完成的不必要过程，并对错误假设持谨慎态度。我们的研究结果突显了关于定义公平相关NLG系统行为的挑战。",
