    "translated_abstract": "S形输出层广泛用于多标签分类（MLC）任务中，其中每个输入可以被分配多个标签。在许多实际的MLC任务中，可能的标签数量在成千上万，往往超过输入特征的数量，导致低秩输出层。在多类分类中，已知这样的低秩输出层是一个瓶颈，可能导致无法Argmax的类别：即任何输入都无法预测的类别。在本文中，我们表明对于MLC任务，类似的S形瓶颈会导致指数级数量的无法Argmax的标签组合。我们解释了如何检测这些无法Argmax的输出，并在三个广泛使用的MLC数据集中证明了它们的存在。然后，我们展示了它们可以通过引入离散傅立叶变换（DFT）输出层在实践中防止，该输出层保证所有稀疏的带有最多k个活跃标签的标签组合都是可Argmax的。我们的DFT层训练速度更快，更可扩展。",
