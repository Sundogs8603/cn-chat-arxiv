    "translated_abstract": "关键词生成（KG）旨在生成一组总结性词语或短语，给定一个源文档，而关键词提取（KE）旨在从文本中识别它们。由于在KE中搜索空间较小，通常将其与KG相结合，预测可能存在或不存在于相应文档中的关键词短语。然而，目前的统一方法采用序列标注和基于最大化的生成，主要在令牌级别上操作，不能很好地观察和评分关键词短语作为一个整体。在这项工作中，我们提出了SimCKP，一个简单的对比学习框架，包括两个阶段：1）提取器-生成器，通过对比学习上下文感知的短语级表示来提取关键词短语，同时生成不出现在文档中的关键词短语；2）重新排序器，通过将它们的表示与相应文档对齐，同样调整每个生成的短语的分数。在多个基准上进行实验证明",
