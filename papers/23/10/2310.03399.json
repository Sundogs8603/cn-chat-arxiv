    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）通过以不同方式聚合周围信息来学习图中节点的表示。随着这些网络的加深，由于邻域尺寸的增加，它们的感受野呈指数增长，导致高内存消耗。图采样通过对图中节点进行抽样来解决GNNs中的内存问题。通过这种方式，GNNs可以扩展到更大的图。大多数采样方法专注于固定的采样启发式算法，这可能无法推广到不同的结构或任务。我们引入了GRAPES，一种自适应的图采样方法，该方法学习识别用于训练GNN分类器的一组具有影响力的节点。GRAPES使用GFlowNet来学习给定分类目标的节点采样概率。我们在几个小规模和大规模图基准上评估了GRAPES，并展示了其在准确性和可扩展性方面的有效性。与现有的采样方法相比，GRAPES即使在采样比例较低的情况下仍保持高准确性。",
