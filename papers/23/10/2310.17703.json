    "translated_abstract": "文件负担是导致临床医生倦怠的主要原因，这种情况在全国范围内日益增加，对我们照顾患者的能力构成了紧迫威胁。像ChatGPT这样的人工智能（AI）聊天机器人可以通过协助文档处理来减轻临床医生的负担。虽然许多医院正在积极将这些系统整合到电子病历系统中，但AI聊天机器人在临床决策中的实用性和影响尚未针对此预期用途进行研究。我们是第一个研究大型语言模型在协助临床医生起草回答患者问题方面的实用性的研究者。在我们的两阶段横断面研究中，6名肿瘤学家对100个逼真的合成癌症患者场景和反映常见医疗情况的门户信息进行了回复，首先是手动回复，然后是通过AI协助回复。我们发现，AI协助的回答更长、可读性较差，但在58%的时间里提供了可接受的草稿而无需编辑。AI协助提高了77%的效率，与传统手动回答相比。",
