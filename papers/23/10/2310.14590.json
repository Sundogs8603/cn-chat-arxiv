    "abstract": "Using high-frequency donation data from a major medical crowdfunding site, this study demonstrates that the 2020 BLM surge decreased the fundraising gap between Black and non-Black beneficiaries by around 50%. The reduction is largely attributed to non-Black donors. Those in counties with moderate BLM activity were most impacted. Innovative instrumental variable utilizing weekends and rainfall identify global and local effects of BLM protests. Results suggest a broad social movement has a greater influence on behavior than a local event. Social media significantly magnifies the impact of protests.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究利用一家重要的医疗众筹网站的高频捐款数据，证明2020年的黑人的命也是命运动使得黑人和非黑人受益人之间的筹款差距减少了约50%。这种减少主要归因于非黑人捐赠者。在有适度黑人的命也是命活动的县市受影响最大。创新的工具变量（利用周末和降雨）确定了黑人的命也是命抗议活动的全球和局部影响。结果表明，广泛的社会运动对行为的影响大于局部事件。社交媒体显著放大了抗议活动的影响。",
