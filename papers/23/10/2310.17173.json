We argue that based on the Maximum Entropy Principle, discrete SAC can be further improved via additional statistical constraints derived from a surrogate critic policy. Furthermore, our findings suggests that these constraints provide an added robustness against potential domain shifts, which are essential for safe deployment of reinforcement learning agents in the real-world. We provide theoretical analysis and show empirical results on low data regimes for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution variants of Atari 2600 games.",
