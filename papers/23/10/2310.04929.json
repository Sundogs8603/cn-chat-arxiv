    "translated_abstract": "现代深度网络非常复杂，其推理结果很难解释。这对于透明地将其部署在安全关键或偏见感知应用中是一个严重的障碍。本研究对后期可解释性特别是网络剖析做出了贡献。我们的目标是提出一个框架，使得在训练于视觉任务的网络中，发现每个神经元的个体功能更容易；通过生成文本描述进行发现。为了实现这个目标，我们利用了以下两个方面：(i)最新的多模态视觉-文本模型的进展和(ii)基于线性单元之间的新概念-随机局部竞争的网络层。在这种设置下，对于给定的输入只有一小部分层神经元被激活，导致极高的激活稀疏性（仅约为4%）。至关重要的是，我们提出的方法推断出了（稀疏的）神经元激活模式，使得神经元能够激活/专门化为...",
