    "abstract": "The performance of automated algorithm selection (AAS) strongly depends on the portfolio of algorithms to choose from. Selecting the portfolio is a non-trivial task that requires balancing the trade-off between the higher flexibility of large portfolios with the increased complexity of the AAS task. In practice, probably the most common way to choose the algorithms for the portfolio is a greedy selection of the algorithms that perform well in some reference tasks of interest.  We set out in this work to investigate alternative, data-driven portfolio selection techniques. Our proposed method creates algorithm behavior meta-representations, constructs a graph from a set of algorithms based on their meta-representation similarity, and applies a graph algorithm to select a final portfolio of diverse, representative, and non-redundant algorithms.

    "translated_abstract": "自动算法选择（AAS）的性能很大程度上取决于要选择的算法投资组合。选择投资组合是一个非常复杂的任务，需要在大型投资组合的高灵活性和AAS任务的增加复杂性之间进行权衡。在实际中，选择投资组合的最常见方法可能是在一些感兴趣的参考任务中选择表现良好的算法。在本研究中，我们旨在探索替代的数据驱动的投资组合选择技术。我们提出的方法创建算法行为元表示，根据它们的元表示相似性从一组算法中构建图形，并应用图形算法来选择多样化、代表性和非冗余的最终投资组合。我们评估了两种不同的元表示技术（SHAP和performance2vec）来选择附加的投资组合，共计324种不同的算法。",
