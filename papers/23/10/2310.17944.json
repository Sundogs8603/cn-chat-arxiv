    "translated_abstract": "边缘计算（EC）和机器学习（ML）的融合，即边缘机器学习（EML），通过利用分布式网络资源以合作方式进行联合训练和推断，已成为一个备受关注的研究领域。然而，EML面临资源限制、异构网络环境以及不同应用的多样化服务需求等各种挑战，这些因素共同影响着EML在利益相关者眼中的可信度。本调查提供了对可信任的EML定义、属性、框架、技术和解决方案的全面总结。具体而言，我们首先强调了在第六代（6G）网络中可信任的EML的重要性。然后，我们从部署和实际应用场景的挑战的角度讨论了可信任性的必要性。随后，我们提供了可信任的EML的初步定义，并探讨了其关键属性。",
