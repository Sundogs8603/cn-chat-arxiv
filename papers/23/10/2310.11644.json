    "abstract": "With the abundant amount of available online and offline text data, there arises a crucial need to extract the relation between phrases and summarize the main content of each document in a few words. For this purpose, there have been many studies recently in Open Information Extraction (OIE). OIE improves upon relation extraction techniques by analyzing relations across different domains and avoids requiring hand-labeling pre-specified relations in sentences. This paper surveys recent approaches of OIE and its applications on Knowledge Graph (KG), text summarization, and Question Answering (QA). Moreover, the paper describes OIE basis methods in relation extraction. It briefly discusses the main approaches and the pros and cons of each method. Finally, it gives an overview about challenges, open issues, and future work opportunities for OIE, relation extraction, and OIE applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着大量的在线和离线文本数据的可用性，需要提取短语之间的关系并用几个词汇总每个文档的主要内容变得至关重要。为此，最近一直进行了许多关于开放信息提取（OIE）的研究。OIE通过分析不同领域的关系来改进关系提取技术，并避免在句子中要求手动标记预定义的关系。本文综述了OIE的最新方法以及其在知识图谱（KG）、文本摘要和问答（QA）中的应用。此外，本文描述了OIE基础方法中的关系提取。它简要讨论了每种方法的主要方法和优缺点。最后，它对OIE、关系提取和OIE应用的挑战、开放问题和未来工作机会进行了概述。",
