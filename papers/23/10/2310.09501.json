    "translated_abstract": "多组分的复合是梵语中普遍存在的现象，理解复合语的组分的隐含结构对于解读其含义至关重要。之前的梵语研究主要关注二元复合，忽视了多组分复合的情况。本文介绍了嵌套复合类型识别（NeCTI）这一新颖任务，旨在识别多组分复合的嵌套片段，并解码它们之间的隐含语义关系。据我们所知，这是词汇语义领域中首次提出这一任务。我们提出了包括域外数据集在内的两个新注释数据集来进行这项任务的基准测试。我们还通过探索嵌套命名实体识别、组成分析和序列到序列等标准问题的有效性，进行了这些数据集的基准测试。我们提出了一种名为DepNeCTI的新型框架：基于依赖关系的嵌套复合类型识别器，其性能超越了现有方法。",
