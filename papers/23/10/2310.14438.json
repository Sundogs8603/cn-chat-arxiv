    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯向量自回归模型（BVARs）是宏观经济预测的基础工具。在过去的十年中，研究已经确认了允许时间变动波动率来捕捉宏观经济不确定性的长期和周期性变化的重要性。这种认识以及大规模数据集的日益可得性，推动了近年来在构建适用于大规模BVARs的随机波动率模型方面的研究激增。其中一些新模型还配备了对于大型系统特别理想的附加功能，如顺序不变性——即估计结果不依赖于变量在BVARs中的排序，以及对COVID-19异常值的稳健性。最近开发的逐方程估计方法极大地降低了估计大规模系统的计算成本，使得对这些大型、灵活的模型进行估计成为可能。尽管取得了最近的进展，仍有许多正在进行的工作，比如参数缩减方法以提高模型计算效率。",
