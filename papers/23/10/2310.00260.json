    "translated_abstract": "对于基于Luce选择公理的广泛选择和排名模型，包括Bradley-Terry-Luce和Plackett-Luce模型，我们证明了相关的最大似然估计问题等价于具有目标行和列和的经典矩阵平衡问题。这个观点打开了两个看似不相关的研究领域之间的交流之门，并使我们能够将选择建模文献中的现有算法统一为Sinkhorn矩阵平衡算法的特殊实例或类似物。我们从这些联系中获得启发，并解决了Sinkhorn算法研究中的重要开放性问题。我们首先证明了当矩阵平衡问题存在有限解时，Sinkhorn算法对于非负矩阵的全局线性收敛。我们通过数据构建的二分图的代数连通性来描述这种全局收敛速度。接下来，我们还得出了线性收敛的尖锐渐近速度。",

It shows the equivalence between maximum likelihood estimation problems and a classic matrix balancing problem, and unifies existing choice modeling algorithms under the framework of Sinkhorn's algorithm. The paper also resolves important issues related to the global linear convergence and sharp asymptotic rate of Sinkhorn's algorithm for non-negative matrices."
