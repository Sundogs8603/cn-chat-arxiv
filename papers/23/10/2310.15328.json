    "translated_abstract": "胸主动脉扩张是一种致命的疾病，可能通过主动脉逐渐扩大而导致剥离或破裂。它通常是无症状的，筛查建议有限。金标准评估是通过计算机断层扫描血管造影（CTA）和放射科医师耗时的评估来完成的。其他适应症的扫描可以帮助进行筛查，但如果没有对比增强或低剂量协议进行获取，可能会使临床评估困难，同时增加放射科医师的扫描数量。在这项研究中，选择了587例独特的CT扫描，包括对照组和胸主动脉扩张患者，使用低剂量和标准剂量协议进行获取，有无对比增强。一种新的分割模型，DeepVox，在开发集和测试集中展示了0.932和0.897的Dice系数，与文献中报告的模型相比，训练速度更快。",
