    "abstract": "Prior work has shown that analyzing the use of first-person singular pronouns can provide insight into individuals' mental status, especially depression symptom severity. These findings were generated by counting frequencies of first-person singular pronouns in text data. However, counting doesn't capture how these pronouns are used. Recent advances in neural language modeling have leveraged methods generating contextual embeddings. In this study, we sought to utilize the embeddings of first-person pronouns obtained from contextualized language representation models to capture ways these pronouns are used, to analyze mental status. De-identified text messages sent during online psychotherapy with weekly assessment of depression severity were used for evaluation. Results indicate the advantage of contextualized first-person pronoun embeddings over standard classification token embeddings and frequency-based pronoun analysis results in predicting depression symptom severity. This suggest",

    "translated_abstract": "先前的研究表明，分析使用第一人称单数代词可以揭示个体的心理状态，特别是抑郁症状的严重程度。这些研究通过计算文本数据中第一人称单数代词的频率来得出结论。然而，计数不能捕捉到这些代词的使用方式。近期神经语言建模的进展利用了生成上下文嵌入的方法。在这项研究中，我们试图利用从上下文语言表征模型中获得的第一人称代词嵌入来捕捉这些代词的使用方式，以分析心理状态。评估过程中使用了在在线心理治疗期间发送的去身份化的文本消息，其中每周评估了抑郁症状的严重程度。结果表明，与标准分类令牌嵌入和基于频率的代词分析相比，上下文化的第一人称代词嵌入在预测抑郁症状的严重程度方面具有优势。",
