Focusing on supervised learning for regression tasks, we develop a regression market to provide a monetary incentive for data sharing.

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习任务对所使用的数据质量很敏感。然而，公司往往很难获得足够的数据集，因为这些数据自然分布在各个所有者之间，而这些所有者在实践中可能是竞争对手，不愿意共享信息。我们针对回归任务的监督学习，开发了一个回归市场，以提供数据共享的经济激励。我们提出的机制采用贝叶斯框架，使我们能够考虑更一般的回归任务类别。我们对市场属性进行了彻底探讨，并展示了目前文献中类似提议暴露市场代理商面临可观的财务风险，而这些风险在我们的设置中可以得到缓解。",
