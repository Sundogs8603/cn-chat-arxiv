    "abstract": "The paper investigates using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically perform web software tasks using click, scroll, and text input operations. Previous approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL) or imitation learning, are inefficient to train and task-specific. Our method uses filtered Document Object Model (DOM) elements as observations and performs tasks step-by-step, sequentially generating small programs based on the current observations. We use in-context learning, either benefiting from a single manually provided example, or an automatically generated example based on a successful zero-shot trial. We evaluate the proposed method on the MiniWob++ benchmark. With only one in-context example, our WebWISE method achieves similar or better performance than other methods that require many demonstrations or trials.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了使用大型语言模型（LLM）自动执行点击、滚动和文本输入操作的Web软件任务。之前的方法，如强化学习（RL）或模仿学习，训练效率低且特定于任务。我们的方法使用筛选后的文档对象模型（DOM）元素作为观察，逐步执行任务，根据当前观察生成小型程序。我们使用上下文学习，可以从单个手动提供的示例中获益，或者从成功的零样例试验中生成自动示例。我们在MiniWob++基准测试上评估了所提出的方法。只有一个上下文示例，我们的WebWISE方法的性能与其他需要许多演示或试验的方法相当或更好。",
