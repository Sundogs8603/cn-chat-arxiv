    "abstract": "This paper investigates the \"Exploitation Business\" model, which capitalizes on information asymmetry to exploit vulnerable populations. It focuses on businesses targeting non-experts or fraudsters who capitalize on information asymmetry to sell their products or services to desperate individuals. This phenomenon is also described as \"profit-making activities based on informational exploitation,\" which thrives on individuals' limited access to information, lack of expertise, and Fear of Missing Out (FOMO).",
