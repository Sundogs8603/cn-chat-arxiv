    "translated_abstract": "Gem5是一个开源、灵活且成本效益高的模拟器，在学术界和工业界的硬件模拟中得到广泛认可和应用。然而，Gem5模拟程序通常耗时较长，因此需要一个可以估计模拟时间的预测模型。目前还没有这样的数据集或模型存在。针对这一空白，本文通过引入专门为此目的创建的独特数据集，提出了一种新颖的贡献。我们还对不同指令类型对Gem5模拟时间的影响进行了分析。在此基础上，我们利用三种不同的模型借助CodeBERT执行基于开发数据集的预测任务。我们优越的回归模型实现了0.546的平均绝对误差（MAE），而我们表现最佳的分类模型记录了0.696的准确率。我们的模型为未来对这个主题的研究建立了基础，同时也作为后续模型的基准。",
