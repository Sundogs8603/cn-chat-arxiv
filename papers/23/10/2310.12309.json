Several software systems, known as argumentation solvers, have been developed to compute the accepted/rejected arguments using such criteria.

In this paper we present a novel framework, which uses an Inductive Logic Programming approach to learn the acceptability semantics for several abstract and structured argumentation frameworks in an interpretable way.

    "translated_abstract": "论证是人工智能领域的一个非常活跃的研究领域，涉及到在人与人或人与人工智能代理之间的对话中所使用的论证的表示和评估。正式论证系统的可接受性语义定义了论证的接受或拒绝的标准。已经开发了一些称为论证求解器的软件系统，用于使用这些标准计算被接受/被拒绝的论证。其中一些系统通过使用不可解释的方法来学习识别接受的论证。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的框架，该框架采用归纳逻辑编程方法以可解释的方式来学习多个抽象和结构化论证框架的可接受性语义。通过实证评估，我们展示了我们的框架优于现有的论证求解器，从而开辟了形式论证和人机对话领域的新的未来研究方向。",
