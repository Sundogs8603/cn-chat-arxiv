    "translated_abstract": "鉴于来自不同来源和各种任务的数据集日益增加，神经网络的普适性成为一个广泛研究的领域。当处理医学数据时，这个问题尤为广泛，因为缺乏方法论标准导致不同的成像中心或使用不同设备和辅助因素获取的数据存在较大变化。为了克服这些限制，我们引入了一种新颖的、普适的、数据-和任务不可知的框架，能够从医学图像中提取显著特征。所提出的四元数小波网络（QUAVE）可以很容易地与任何现有的医学图像分析或综合任务相结合，并且可以结合实际、四元数或超复值模型，推广它们对单通道数据的采用。QUAVE首先通过四元数小波变换提取不同的子带，得到低频/近似频带和高频/细粒度特征。然后，它对最有代表性的特征进行加权处理，从而减少了特征重要性不均匀性。",

It can be easily integrated with existing medical image analysis tasks and generalizes the adoption to single-channel data. By utilizing quaternion wavelet transform and weighting, QUAVE is able to handle medical data with large variations."
