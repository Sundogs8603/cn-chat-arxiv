    "translated_abstract": "强大的大型语言模型(LLM)的出现为历史记忆的对话形式提供了一种新的研究途径。我们通过将高度专业化学术资源的向量嵌入引入到LLM中，使得对话方法可以被历史学家和其他人文学科研究人员使用。具体地，我们评估和展示了LLM在研究人员检查不同类型文档的定制语料库时的辅助能力，包括但不限于：(1).一手资料，(2).由专家撰写的二手资料，以及(3).两者的结合。与传统的数字目录搜索界面（如元数据和全文搜索）相比，我们评估了LLM的更丰富的对话风格对两种主要任务的表现：(1).问答，以及(2).数据的提取和组织。我们展示了LLM的语义检索和推理能力在这些任务中的效果。",
