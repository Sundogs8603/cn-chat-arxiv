    "abstract": "In a spoken dialogue system, an NLU model is preceded by a speech recognition system that can deteriorate the performance of natural language understanding. This paper proposes a method for investigating the impact of speech recognition errors on the performance of natural language understanding models. The proposed method combines the back transcription procedure with a fine-grained technique for categorizing the errors that affect the performance of NLU models. The method relies on the usage of synthesized speech for NLU evaluation. We show that the use of synthesized speech in place of audio recording does not change the outcomes of the presented technique in a significant way.",

    "translated_abstract": "在口语对话系统中，自然语言理解模型之前是一个可能影响其性能的语音识别系统。本文提出了一种用于研究语音识别错误对自然语言理解模型性能影响的方法。该方法将反转录程序与细粒度的技术相结合，用于对影响NLU模型性能的错误进行分类。该方法依赖于使用合成语音进行NLU评估。我们证明在重要程度上，将合成语音用于音频录制的替代方法不会显著改变所提出技术的结果。",
