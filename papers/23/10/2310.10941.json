    "translated_abstract": "抑郁症是一种对人们生活产生深远影响的心理健康障碍。最近的研究表明，可以通过个体的交流方式（包括口头和书面文字）检测到抑郁症的迹象。特别是，社交媒体帖子是一个可供我们检查抑郁症状的丰富而方便的文本来源。贝克抑郁量表（BDI）问卷通常用于衡量抑郁症的严重程度，它是本研究中可以辅助使用的工具之一。我们可以将研究范围缩小到这些症状，因为每个BDI问题都与特定的抑郁症状相关联。需要记住，并非每个抑郁症患者同时表现出所有症状，而是其中的一些综合出现。因此，能确定一个句子或一段用户生成的内容与特定条件相关是非常有价值的。基于这一点，eRisk 2023任务1的设计目的正是为了评估不同条件的相关性。",
