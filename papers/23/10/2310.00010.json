    "translated_abstract": "近十年来，机器学习（ML）和辅助发展机器人学（ADR）领域的研究人员对人工共情（AE）作为可能的未来人机交互（HRI）范式产生了兴趣。人类从出生开始就学会共情，因此在机器人和智能机器中灌输这种感觉是具有挑战性的。然而，通过对大量数据和时间进行训练，在某种程度上可以使机器人模仿共情。人工共情的标准工作流程包括三个阶段：1）使用从视频或文本数据中提取的特征进行情绪识别（ER），2）分析感知的情绪或共情程度以选择最佳行动方案，3）执行响应动作。最近的研究显示，使用虚拟代理或机器人的AE常常涉及深度学习（DL）技术。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文综述了人工共情的分类研究，介绍了深度学习技术、数据集和评估标准的最新进展，指出训练人工共情的标准流程包括情绪识别、分析和响应动作。其中深度学习技术在虚拟代理和机器人中的应用有较高影响力。"
