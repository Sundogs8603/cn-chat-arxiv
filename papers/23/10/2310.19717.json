    "translated_abstract": "支持向量机（SVM）是机器学习领域中最受研究的范式之一，用于分类和回归问题。它依赖于向量化的输入数据。然而，现实世界中的许多数据存在于矩阵格式中，这些数据通过将矩阵重新整形为向量的方式输入到SVM中。重新整形的过程破坏了矩阵数据中固有的空间相关性。此外，将矩阵转换为向量会导致输入数据的维度很高，引入了显着的计算复杂性。为了解决分类矩阵输入数据的这些问题，提出了支持矩阵机器（SMM）。它代表了专门用于处理矩阵输入数据的新兴方法之一。SMM方法通过使用谱弹性网络性质（核范数和Frobenius范数的组合）保留了矩阵数据的结构信息。本文首次对支持矩阵机器的发展进行了深入分析。",
