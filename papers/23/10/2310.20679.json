    "translated_abstract": "相互作用对象的系统在其动力学中通常会受到场效应的影响，然而以往的研究常常忽略了这些效应，假设系统在真空中演化。本文着眼于发现这些场效应，并仅通过观察到的动力学来进行推断，而无需直接观测它们。我们假设存在潜在的力场，并提出使用神经场来学习它们。由于观察到的动力学是局部物体相互作用和整体场效应的综合结果，最近流行的等变网络无法应用，因为它们无法捕捉到全局信息。为了解决这个问题，我们提出将局部物体相互作用（SE(n)等变的，依赖于相对状态）与外部全局场效应（依赖于绝对状态）相分离。我们使用等变图网络对相互作用进行建模，并将其与神经场结合在一起，构建了一种融合了场效应的图网络。",
