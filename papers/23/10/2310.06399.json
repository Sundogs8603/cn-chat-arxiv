    "translated_abstract": "寻找新药变得越来越困难。药物发现的希望之一是使用机器学习模型预测分子属性。因此，正在开发和测试分子属性预测模型，以在MoleculeNet等基准测试中应用。然而，现有的基准测试不切实际，并且与实际应用模型相差太大。我们创建了一个新的实用的Lo-Hi基准测试，包括两个任务：前导优化（Lo）和命中识别（Hi），对应于真实的药物发现过程。对于Hi任务，我们设计了一种解决平衡顶点最小k-Cut问题的新型分子拆分算法。我们测试了最先进和经典的机器学习模型，揭示了在实际环境中哪种效果更好。我们分析了现代基准测试，并显示它们不切实际并且过于乐观。",

For the hit identification task, researchers designed a novel molecular splitting algorithm to solve the balanced vertex minimum k-Cut problem and tested the performance of various machine learning models. The study also revealed the unrealistic and overly optimistic nature of existing benchmarks."
