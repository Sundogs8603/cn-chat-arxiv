    "abstract": "Video emotion recognition is an important branch of affective computing, and its solutions can be applied in different fields such as human-computer interaction (HCI) and intelligent medical treatment. Although the number of papers published in the field of emotion recognition is increasing, there are few comprehensive literature reviews covering related research on video emotion recognition. Therefore, this paper selects articles published from 2015 to 2023 to systematize the existing trends in video emotion recognition in related studies. In this paper, we first talk about two typical emotion models, then we talk about databases that are frequently utilized for video emotion recognition, including unimodal databases and multimodal databases. Next, we look at and classify the specific structure and performance of modern unimodal and multimodal video emotion recognition methods, talk about the benefits and drawbacks of each, and then we compare them in detail in the tables.

    "translated_abstract": "视频情感识别是情感计算的重要分支，其解决方案可应用于人机交互（HCI）和智能医疗等领域。尽管情感识别领域发表的论文数量正在增加，但很少有全面的综述报道相关的视频情感识别研究。因此，本文选择了2015年至2023年发表的文章，系统总结了相关研究中视频情感识别的现有趋势。本文首先讨论了两种典型的情感模型，然后介绍了经常用于视频情感识别的单模态数据库和多模态数据库。接下来，我们研究和分类了现代单模态和多模态视频情感识别方法的具体结构和性能，并讨论了每种方法的优缺点，并详细比较了它们的表现。此外，",
