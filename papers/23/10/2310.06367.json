    "abstract": "Virtual screening, which identifies potential drugs from vast compound databases to bind with a particular protein pocket, is a critical step in AI-assisted drug discovery. Traditional docking methods are highly time-consuming, and can only work with a restricted search library in real-life applications.

In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework, DrugCLIP, by reformulating virtual screening as a dense retrieval task and employing contrastive learning to align representations of binding protein pockets and molecules from a large quantity of pairwise data without explicit binding-affinity scores.

    "translated_abstract": "虚拟筛选是AI辅助药物发现中的关键步骤，它从庞大的化合物数据库中识别出与特定蛋白质口袋结合的潜在药物。传统的对接方法耗时且只能在现实应用中使用受限的搜索库。近年来，使用评分函数进行结合亲和力预测的监督学习方法虽然有所改进，但由于对可靠结合亲和力标签的有限数据依赖性强，尚未超越对接方法。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的对比学习框架DrugCLIP，将虚拟筛选重新表述为密集检索任务，并利用对比学习来对齐毫不依赖于显式结合亲和力评分的大量成对数据中的蛋白质口袋和分子表示。我们还引入了一种受生物知识启发的数据增强策略，以学习更好的蛋白质-分子表示。",
    "tldr": "DrugCLIP将虚拟筛选转化为对比学习任务，通过使用对比学习来对齐来自大量成对的蛋白质口袋和分子的表示，实现了虚拟筛选的加速。这项新方法不依赖于蛋白质分子的特定结合亲和力评分，而是利用大量数据进行表示学习，并引入了生物学知识启发的数据增强策略。"
