    "translated_abstract": "对于延迟反馈的对抗性多臂赌博机问题，我们考虑延迟反馈结果来自多个用户，并且对内部分布没有限制。当玩家选择一个臂时，来自多个用户的反馈可能不会立即接收到，而是在一个未知的时间延迟之后才能接收到。在一个回合中，不同用户的反馈延迟没有潜在的相关性。因此，我们形式化了一个具有多用户延迟反馈的对抗性多臂赌博机问题，并设计了一种名为MUD-EXP3的改进EXP3算法，该算法通过考虑来自不同用户的重要性加权估计器在每个回合做出决策。在已知终止回合索引$T$、用户数量$M$、臂数量$N$和延迟上界$d_{max}$的前提下，我们证明了一个$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{TM^2\\ln{N}(N\\mathrm{e}+4d_{max})})$的遗憾值。此外，对于未知$T$的更常见情况，设计了一种自适应算法。",
