    "translated_abstract": "深度对冲是量化金融中的一个有前景的方向，结合了深度学习研究中的模型和技术。虽然可以提供出色的对冲策略，但模型对于神经网络的架构设计需要仔细处理。为了缓解这些困难，我们引入了SigFormer，这是一个将路径签名和Transformer的能力结合起来处理序列数据的新型深度学习模型，特别是对于存在不规则性的情况。路径签名可以有效捕捉复杂的数据模式，而Transformer则提供了优秀的序列注意力。我们在合成数据上对我们提出的模型进行了实证比较，展示了更快的学习速度和增强的鲁棒性，特别是在存在不规则的基础价格数据的情况下。此外，我们通过对冲SP 500指数的真实回测验证了我们模型的性能，并展示了积极的结果。",
