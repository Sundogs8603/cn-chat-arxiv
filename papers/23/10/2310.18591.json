    "translated_abstract": "决策分析涉及建模和增强决策过程。在改善行为方面的一个主要挑战是首先获得现有行为的透明描述。在本文中，我们发展了一个表达丰富的逆向决策建模的统一视角：一个学习参数化顺序决策行为表示的框架。首先，我们规范化了前向问题（作为规范标准），包含了常见的控制行为类别。其次，我们使用这个框架来规范化逆向问题（作为一个描述性模型），广义上推广了现有关于模仿/奖励学习的工作，同时打开了更广泛的行为表示研究问题类别。最后，我们通过一个例子（逆向有限理性控制）实例化了这个方法，说明了这个结构如何能够学习（可解释的）有限理性表示-同时自然地捕捉到次优动作、偏见信仰等直观概念。",

It provides a transparent description of behavior and can be applied to a wide range of behavior representation research problems. Furthermore, it demonstrates how this approach can learn interpretable representations of bounded rationality while capturing intuitive notions of suboptimal actions and biased beliefs."
