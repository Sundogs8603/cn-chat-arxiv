    "translated_abstract": "美国2022年国防战略将气候变化列为对国家安全的严重威胁。已经提出了诸如平流层气溶胶喷射等气候干预方法作为缓解策略，但此类行动对复杂气候系统的下游影响尚不明确。开发量化与气候事件相关的源和影响变量（即气候路径）之间关系的算法技术将有助于决策。数据驱动的深度学习模型已成为建模高度非线性关系的强大工具，可能为刻画气候变量关系提供一种途径。本文探索了使用回声状态网络（ESN）对气候路径进行刻画的方法。ESN是一种计算高效的神经网络变体，专为处理时间数据而设计，最近的研究提出ESN可以用作预测时空气候数据的有用工具。与其他模型（如LSTM）相比，ESN具有更快的训练速度，更少的参数和更好的泛化能力。我们使用特征重要性分析，以了解各个变量对气候路径的影响。",
