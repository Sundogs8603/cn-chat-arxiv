    "translated_abstract": "近年来，物联网作为一个领域已经在数据量和网络安全威胁方面与移动网络环境相媲美。物联网环境中的数据机密性和隐私已经成为安全研究的重要领域。越来越多的安全专家对设计健壮的入侵检测系统以保护物联网环境表示兴趣，作为传统安全方法的补充。由于物联网设备资源受限，并且具有异构的协议栈，大多数传统的入侵检测方法在这些架构限制下效果不佳。这促使安全研究人员创新地将机器学习和入侵检测系统结合起来，以解决非学习型入侵检测系统在物联网生态系统中的缺点。尽管各种机器学习算法已经在物联网数据集上取得了较高的准确性，但我们还缺乏足够的生产级模型。本文对现有的基于机器学习的物联网入侵检测系统进行了综述和评估。",
