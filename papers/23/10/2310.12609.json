While some of these methods effectively address complex problems, they often depend heavily on inference-time obstacle detection and require additional equipment. Addressing these challenges, we present a method that, during inference time, simultaneously generates only reachable goals and plans motions that avoid obstacles, all from a single visual input. Central to our approach is the novel use of a collision-avoiding diffusion kernel for training. Through evaluations against behavior-cloning and classical diffusion models, our framework has proven its robustness. It is particularly effective in multi-modal environments, navigating toward goals and avoiding unreachable ones blocked by obstacles, while ensuring collision avoidance.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于其灵活性和多模态性，扩散模型在机器人领域中已经成为一种强大的工具。尽管其中一些方法有效地解决了复杂问题，但它们往往严重依赖于推理时的障碍物检测并需要额外的设备。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种方法，该方法在推理时能够从单一的视觉输入中同时生成可达目标并规划避开障碍物的运动路径。我们的方法的核心是对训练过程中新颖的碰撞避免扩散核进行使用。通过与行为克隆和经典扩散模型进行评估，我们的框架证明了其稳健性。特别是在多模态环境中，它能够导航到目标并避开被障碍物阻挡的不可达目标，同时确保避免碰撞。",
