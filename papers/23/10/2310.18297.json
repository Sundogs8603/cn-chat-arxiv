    "abstract": "Classical clustering methods do not provide users with direct control of the clustering results, and the clustering results may not be consistent with the relevant criterion that a user has in mind. In this work, we present a new methodology for performing image clustering based on user-specified text criteria by leveraging modern vision-language models and large language models. We call our method Image Clustering Conditioned on Text Criteria (IC$|$TC), and it represents a different paradigm of image clustering. IC$|$TC requires a minimal and practical degree of human intervention and grants the user significant control over the clustering results in return. Our experiments show that IC$|$TC can effectively cluster images with various criteria, such as human action, physical location, or the person's mood, while significantly outperforming baselines.",
