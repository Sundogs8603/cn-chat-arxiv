    "abstract": "In recent years, Chinese Spelling Check (CSC) has been greatly improved by designing task-specific pre-training methods or introducing auxiliary tasks, which mostly solve this task in an end-to-end fashion. In this paper, we propose to decompose the CSC workflow into detection, reasoning, and searching subtasks so that the rich external knowledge about the Chinese language can be leveraged more directly and efficiently. Specifically, we design a plug-and-play detection-and-reasoning module that is compatible with existing SOTA non-autoregressive CSC models to further boost their performance. We find that the detection-and-reasoning module trained for one model can also benefit other models. We also study the primary interpretability provided by the task decomposition. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of the proposed module.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，通过设计任务特定的预训练方法或引入辅助任务，中文拼写检查（CSC）得到了显著改进，这些方法大多以端到端的方式解决了这个任务。本文提出将CSC工作流分解为检测、推理和搜索子任务，以更直接高效地利用关于中文语言的丰富外部知识。具体而言，我们设计了一个兼容现有SOTA非自回归CSC模型的即插即用的检测和推理模块，以进一步提升它们的性能。我们发现，针对一个模型训练的检测和推理模块也可以使其他模型受益。我们还研究了任务分解所提供的主要可解释性。大量实验证明了所提出模块的有效性和竞争力。",
