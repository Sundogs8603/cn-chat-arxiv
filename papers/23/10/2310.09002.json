    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的故障诊断方法需要大量的训练数据，然而由于分布在不同实体中，这些数据很难获取。联邦学习可以保障数据隐私的前提下，使多个客户端 collaboratively 训练共享模型。然而，客户端之间的领域差异和数据稀缺问题会降低全局联邦学习模型的性能。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的基于表示编码的联邦元学习 (REFML) 框架用于少样本故障诊断。首先，我们开发了一种基于表示编码和元学习的新型训练策略，它充分利用了训练客户端之间的异质性，将其有效地转化为对未见工况或设备类型的越域泛化的优势。此外，我们还提出了一种自适应插值方法，用于计算局部模型和全局模型的最优组合，作为局部训练的初始化。",
