    "translated_abstract": "电力负荷预测是智能电网中的重要任务，可以帮助平衡供需。尽管先进的深度学习模型需要大量高分辨率数据来准确预测短期负荷，但细粒度的负荷曲线可能暴露用户的用电行为，引发隐私和安全问题。一种改善数据隐私的解决方案是联邦学习，即在私有数据上本地训练模型，并将训练好的模型参数合并和更新到全局服务器。因此，本文提出了一种新颖的基于Transformer的深度学习方法，结合联邦学习进行短期电力负荷预测。为了评估我们的结果，我们将我们的联邦学习架构与中心化和本地学习进行了基准测试，并将我们的模型性能与长短期记忆模型和卷积神经网络进行了比较。我们的模拟基于德国一所大学校园的数据集，结果表明Transformer-based federated learning具有良好的性能。",
