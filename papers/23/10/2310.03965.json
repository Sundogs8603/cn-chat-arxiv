    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理任务中取得了显著的成功，但现有的提示方法无法重用解决类似问题的见解，并且在多步推理中累积了错误，因为它们要求LLMs从零开始推理。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了“思维传播”（TP），它探索类似问题并利用它们的解决方案来增强LLMs的复杂推理能力。这些类比问题与输入问题相关，具有可重用的解决方案和问题解决策略。因此，将解决先前类似问题的见解传播以激发新的问题解决是有希望的。为了实现这一点，TP首先提示LLMs提出并解决一组与输入问题相关的类比问题。然后，TP重用类比问题的结果直接产生一个新的解决方案或者推导一个知识密集型计划。",
