    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们提出了一种后处理解决方案来解决跨模态检索中的中心程度问题。这是一个现象，其中一个小部分画廊数据点经常被检索，导致检索性能下降。我们首先从理论上证明了将画廊和查询数据都纳入考虑解决中心程度问题的必要性，因为中心点始终与画廊和查询数据具有高相似性。其次，基于我们的理论结果，我们提出了一种新的框架，双库归一化（DBNorm）。之前的工作尝试通过仅利用查询样本来减轻中心程度问题，而DBNorm利用从查询样本和画廊样本构建的两个库来减少推理过程中中心点的出现。接下来，为了补充DBNorm，我们引入了两种新方法，即双反softmax和双动态反softmax，用于基于这两个库进行相似度归一化。具体而言，我们提出的方法减少了中心点和查询样本之间的相似性。",
