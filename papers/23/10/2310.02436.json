    "translated_abstract": "标普500指数被认为是金融市场中最受欢迎的交易工具。随着加密货币在过去几年的崛起，比特币也在受到越来越多的关注和应用。该论文旨在分析比特币和标普500指数的日回报分布，并通过两个财务风险指标评估其尾部概率。作为方法论，我们使用比特币和标普500指数的日回报数据，通过将快速分数傅里叶（FRFT）算法与12点规则复合牛顿-科茨积分相结合的先进快速分数傅里叶变换（FRFT）方案来拟合七参数广义调和稳定（GTS）分布。研究结果表明，标普500回报分布的主要特点是尖峰状，而比特币回报分布的主要特点是重尾状。GTS分布显示，$80.05\\%$的标普500回报在$-1.06\\%$和$1.23\\%$之间，而只有$40.32\\%$的比特币回报在这个范围内。",
