    "translated_abstract": "训练用于预测社交媒体用户未来活动的回归模型需要丰富的特征才能得到准确的预测。许多先进模型用于生成这些特征；然而，当它们在海量数据集上运行时，它们的计算时间复杂度通常是禁锢的。一些研究表明，简单的语义网络特征可能足够丰富，可用于回归而无需复杂的计算。我们提出了一种使用语义网络作为用户级特征进行机器学习任务的方法。我们进行了一项实验，使用了一个包含370万条与2022年法国总统选举有关的推文的1037个Twitter标签的语义网络。构建了一个双分图，其中标签是节点，带权边连接标签，反映了与这些标签互动的Twitter用户数量。然后将图转换为具有最受欢迎的哈希标签的最大生成树。",
