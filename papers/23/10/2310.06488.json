    "translated_abstract": "脉冲神经网络（SNNs）已经证明其在视觉和语言领域中能够实现与深度神经网络（DNNs）相当的性能，同时具有能效提高和符合生物合理性的优势。然而，将这种单模态的SNNs扩展到多模态的情景仍然是一个未开发的领域。受到对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）概念的启发，我们引入了一个名为SpikeCLIP的新框架，通过“对齐预训练+双损失微调”的两步骤配方，来解决脉冲计算背景下两种模态之间的差距。广泛的实验证明，在常用的用于多模态模型评估的各种数据集上，SNNs取得了与其DNNs对应物相当的结果，同时显著降低了能源消耗。此外，SpikeCLIP在图像分类方面保持了稳定的性能。",
