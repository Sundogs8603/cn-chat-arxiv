    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce NarrativePlay, a novel system that allows users to role-play a fictional character and interact with other characters in narratives such as novels in an immersive environment. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like responses, guided by personality traits extracted from narratives. The system incorporates auto-generated visual display of narrative settings, character portraits, and character speech, greatly enhancing user experience. Our approach eschews predefined sandboxes, focusing instead on main storyline events extracted from narratives from the perspective of a user-selected character. NarrativePlay has been evaluated on two types of narratives, detective and adventure stories, where users can either explore the world or improve their favorability with the narrative characters through conversations.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了NarrativePlay，一个创新的系统，允许用户在虚构环境中扮演虚构角色，并与其他角色进行互动，如小说等故事中。我们利用大型语言模型（LLMs）根据从叙事中提取的个性特征生成类人回应。该系统结合了自动生成的叙事设置的视觉展示、角色形象以及角色的言谈，极大地提升了用户体验。我们的方法摒弃了预定义的沙盒，而是从用户选择的角色的视角，关注从叙事中提取的主要故事情节。NarrativePlay已在侦探和冒险故事两种类型的叙事中进行了评估，在这些叙事中，用户可以通过对话要么探索世界要么提高与叙事角色的亲和力。",
