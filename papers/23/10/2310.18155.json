    "translated_abstract": "随着代码混合数据的日益流行，对这种类型的数据有更好的处理方式的需求也越来越大，这种数据存在一些挑战，如处理拼写变体、不同语言、不同脚本以及资源匮乏。当前的语言模型在处理代码混合数据时面临困难，因为它们主要关注单词的语义表示，而忽视了听觉音标特征。这导致处理代码混合文本中的拼写变体时出现困难。在本文中，我们提出了一种有效的方法，利用从SOUNDEX中提取的单词的听觉信息来创建用于处理代码混合文本数据的语言模型。我们的方法包括基于掩码语言建模的预训练步骤，其中包括SOUNDEX表示（SAMLM）和一种向预训练模型提供输入数据的新方法。通过对各种代码混合数据集（不同语言）进行情绪、冒犯和攻击实验，我们验证了我们的方法的有效性。",
