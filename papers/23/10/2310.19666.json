    "translated_abstract": "张量分解是多维数据分析的重要工具。在实践中，数据往往稀疏但与丰富的时间信息相关。然而，现有方法常常未充分利用时间信息，并忽视稀疏观测张量条目内的结构知识。为了克服这些限制，更好地捕捉潜在的时态结构，我们提出了动态张量分解方法Dynamic EMbedIngs fOr dynamic Tensor dEcomposition (DEMOTE)。我们开发了一种神经扩散反应过程来估计每个张量模式中实体的动态嵌入。具体而言，基于观测到的张量条目，我们构建了一个多部分图来编码实体之间的相关性。我们构建了一个图扩散过程来共同演化相关实体的嵌入轨迹，并使用神经网络为每个单独的实体构建了一个反应过程。通过这种方式，我们的模型能够在演化过程中捕捉到共性和个性。",
