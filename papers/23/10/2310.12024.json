    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了CORE，一个针对公司关系和商业实体的少样本关系分类（RC）数据集。CORE包括4708个实例和12种关系类型，其中包含从公司维基百科页面提取的文本证据。由于与公司名称和商业实体相关的丰富多样的信息，少样本RC模型面临挑战。例如，根据上下文，公司名称可能表示法律实体、产品、人员或业务部门。因此，推导实体之间的关系类型高度依赖于文本上下文。为了评估最先进的RC模型在CORE数据集上的性能，我们在少样本领域适应设置下进行实验。我们的结果显示了显著的性能差距，证实了在不同领域训练的模型在适应CORE方面存在困难。有趣的是，我们发现在CORE上训练的模型展示了改进的跨领域性能，突显了其先进性。",
