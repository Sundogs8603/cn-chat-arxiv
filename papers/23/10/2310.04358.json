    "translated_abstract": "阿尔茨海默病（AD）是一种通过自发性语音进行检测的疾病，但训练数据的稀缺性仍然是一个重要问题。本文通过知识转移来处理这个问题，具体来说是从语音通用和抑郁特定的知识中进行转移。首先，本文研究了从通用基础模型中进行顺序知识转移，这些模型是在大量语音和文本数据上预训练的。然后，对基于不同基础模型不同中间块提取的表示进行了AD诊断的块分析。除了来自语音通用表示的知识外，本文还提出了同时从基于抑郁症和AD高共病率的语音抑郁检测任务中转移知识的方法。研究了一个并行的知识转移框架，共同学习这两个任务之间的共享信息。实验结果表明，所提出的方法提高了AD和depression的诊断性能。",
