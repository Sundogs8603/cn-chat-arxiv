    "translated_abstract": "由于对不断进化的新一代蜂窝网络的需求增加、环境和监管方面的关注以及由地缘政治紧张局势引发的潜在能源危机，无线网络的节能越来越重要。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于近似动态规划（ADP）的方法，结合在线优化，在维持足够的服务质量（QoS）指标的同时，切换基站的小区以减少网络的功耗。我们使用多层感知器（MLP）来预测功耗以近似ADP中的值函数，以选择能够节约期望功耗最优的动作。为了在不损害QoS的情况下尽可能节约功耗，我们还使用另一个MLP来预测QoS，并使用长短期记忆网络（LSTM）来预测切换，将其纳入在线优化算法，生成用于根据整体情况筛选小区切换动作的自适应QoS阈值。",
