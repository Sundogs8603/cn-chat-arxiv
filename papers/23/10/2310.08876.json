    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种基于60 GHz调频连续波(FMCW)雷达的轻量级手势识别系统。我们展示了手势可以通过一组五个特征有效地进行特征化，并提出了一种精简的雷达处理算法来提取这些特征。与之前的方法相比，我们避免了繁重的二维处理，即距离-多普勒成像，并改为进行早期目标检测-这使得我们能够将系统移植到具有内存、计算和功耗严格限制的完全嵌入式平台上。基于循环神经网络(RNN)的架构利用这些特征共同检测和分类五种不同的手势。所提出的系统在我们的保留测试数据集上以98.4%的F1分数识别手势，它在一个Arm Cortex-M4微控制器上运行，需要不到280 kB的闪存存储器，120 kB的RAM，并消耗75 mW的功耗。",
