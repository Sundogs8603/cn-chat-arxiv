    "abstract": "Simultaneous Speech-to-Text translation serves a critical role in real-time crosslingual communication. Despite the advancements in recent years, challenges remain in achieving stability in the translation process, a concern primarily manifested in the flickering of partial results. In this paper, we propose a novel revision-controllable method designed to address this issue. Our method introduces an allowed revision window within the beam search pruning process to screen out candidate translations likely to cause extensive revisions, leading to a substantial reduction in flickering and, crucially, providing the capability to completely eliminate flickering. The experiments demonstrate the proposed method can significantly improve the decoding stability without compromising substantially on the translation quality.",

    "translated_abstract": "同时语音到文本翻译在实时跨语言交流中起着关键作用。尽管近年来取得了一些进展，但在翻译过程中仍然面临稳定性的挑战，主要表现为部分结果的闪烁。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的可控修订方法，旨在解决这个问题。我们的方法在波束搜索修剪过程中引入了一个允许的修订窗口，用于筛选出可能造成广泛修订的候选翻译，从而大大减少闪烁，并且关键地提供了完全消除闪烁的能力。实验证明，所提出的方法可以显著改善解码稳定性，同时不大幅度影响翻译质量。",
