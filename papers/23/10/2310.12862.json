    "abstract": "Adaptable models could greatly benefit robotic agents operating in the real world, allowing them to deal with novel and varying conditions. While approaches such as Bayesian inference are well-studied frameworks for adapting models to evidence, we build on recent advances in deep generative models which have greatly affected many areas of robotics. Harnessing modern GPU acceleration, we investigate how to quickly adapt the sample generation of neural network models to observations in robotic tasks. We propose a simple and general method that is applicable to various deep generative models and robotic environments. The key idea is to quickly fine-tune the model by fitting it to generated samples matching the observed evidence, using the cross-entropy method. We show that our method can be applied to both autoregressive models and variational autoencoders, and demonstrate its usability in object shape inference from grasping, inverse kinematics calculation, and point cloud completion.",

    "translated_abstract": "可适应的模型可以极大地改善在真实世界中操作的机器人代理，使其能够处理新颖和多变的情况。虽然诸如贝叶斯推理等方法已成为将模型适应于证据的研究框架，但我们在深度生成模型的最新进展的基础上进行了研究，这些进展已经极大地影响了机器人领域的许多方面。通过利用现代GPU加速，我们研究了如何将神经网络模型的样本生成快速适应到机器人任务观测中。我们提出了一种简单而通用的方法，适用于各种深度生成模型和机器人环境。关键思想是通过使用交叉熵方法，将模型迅速微调以适应与观测证据相符的生成样本。我们展示了我们的方法可应用于自回归模型和变分自动编码器，并展示了它在物体形状推理、逆向运动学计算和点云补全中的可用性。",
