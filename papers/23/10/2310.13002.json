    "translated_abstract": "虽然大型语言模型（LLM）在各种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但对于它们对地理数据的理解程度以及在推动明智的地理决策方面的能力了解甚少。本文研究了这些预训练LLM中编码的地理知识、意识和推理能力的程度。通过关注自回归语言模型，我们设计了实验方法，包括（i）探测LLM的地理坐标，以评估地理知识，（ii）使用地理和非地理介词来评估其地理意识，以及（iii）利用多维尺度（MDS）实验评估模型的地理推理能力，并根据提示确定城市的位置。我们的结果证实，从文本信息中综合地理知识不仅需要更大的，而且需要更复杂的LLM。因此，这项研究为我们对LLM的理解提供了贡献。",
