    "translated_abstract": "手势识别(HGR)由于人工智能驱动的人机界面对外周神经系统的生物信号(如表面肌电图(sEMG))进行深度时空动力学解读的增加而引起了重视。这些界面具有广泛的应用，包括扩展现实的控制、灵活的假肢和外骨骼。然而，sEMG在个体之间的自然变异性导致研究人员专注于个体特定的解决方案。深度学习方法通常具有复杂的结构，对数据需求较多，并且训练时间较长，这使得它们对于个体特定应用的实际性较低。在本文中，我们提出并开发了一个可泛化的瞬态高密度sEMG(HD-sEMG)的序列解码器，通过主题嵌入迁移学习，在部分观察的受试者中实现了65个手势的平均准确率为73%。",
