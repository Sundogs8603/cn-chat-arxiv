    "translated_abstract": "时空图神经网络在各种现实世界的城市应用中，包括智能交通和公共安全等，因其有效建模时空依赖性的能力而受到广泛关注。然而，时空图神经网络的黑盒性质限制了其可解释性，阻碍了其在城市资源分配和政策制定相关场景中的应用。为了弥合这一差距，我们提出了一个可解释的时空图神经网络（STExplainer）框架，通过增强STGNNs的内在可解释性，使其能够同时提供准确的预测和忠实的解释。我们的框架将统一的时空图注意力网络与位置信息融合层作为STG编码器和解码器进行集成。此外，我们基于图信息瓶颈（GIB）原则提出了一种具有可解释目标的结构蒸馏方法，该方法通过实例化GIB原则来提高可解释性。",
