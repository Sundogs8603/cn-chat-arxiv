    "translated_abstract": "随着自然语言处理（NLP）系统越来越多地应用于复杂的社会环境中，一个迫切的问题出现了：这些NLP系统能否模仿类人类的协作智能，在由多个大型语言模型（LLMs）组成的多代理社会中？本文通过将实践实验与理论观点相结合，探究当代NLP系统之间的协作机制。我们构建了四个由LLM代理组成的独特“社会”，每个代理以特定的“特质”（随和或过于自信）为特征，并与不同的“思维模式”（辩论或反思）展开协作。通过在三个基准数据集上评估这些多代理社会，我们发现某些协作策略不仅胜过先前顶尖方法，而且优化了效率（使用更少的API令牌）。此外，我们的结果进一步说明LLM代理可以",
