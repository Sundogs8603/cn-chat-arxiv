    "translated_abstract": "时空点过程（STPPs）是建模和预测具有时间和空间特征的事件的强大数学工具。尽管它们的多功能性，但大多数现有的学习STPPs的方法要么假设了一种受限的时空分布形式，要么由于复杂积分的不准确近似而遭受了问题。这些问题通常来自概率密度函数的归一化项。此外，当前的技术无法为模型预测提供不确定性量化，例如预测事件到达时间的置信区间和事件位置的置信区域，这在考虑到数据的相当随机性的情况下是关键的。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了SMASH：一种基于分数匹配的伪似然度量，用于学习具有不确定性量化的标记STPPs。具体来说，我们的框架通过估计来自标记数据的采样预测分布来采用无归一化的目标。然后，我们使用分数匹配从模型分布中进行采样并最小化与真实分布之间的分数距离。",
