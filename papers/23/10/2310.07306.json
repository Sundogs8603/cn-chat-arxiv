    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于软标签和噪声混合的开放意图分类模型（SNOiC）。先前的工作大多使用基于阈值的方法来识别开放意图，容易出现过拟合问题，并可能产生有偏的预测结果。此外，对于开放意图类别需要更多可用数据的需求也是现有模型的另一个限制。SNOiC将软标签和噪声混合策略结合起来，以减少偏差并为开放意图类别生成伪数据。在四个基准数据集上的实验结果显示，SNOiC模型在识别开放意图方面的最低和最高性能分别为68.72％和94.71％。此外，与最先进的模型相比，SNOiC模型在识别开放意图方面的性能提升了0.93％（最低）和12.76％（最高）。通过分析所提出模型中使用的各种参数进一步证明了模型的有效性。还进行了消融研究，其中",
