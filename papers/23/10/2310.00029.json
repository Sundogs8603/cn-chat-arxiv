This paper focuses on the development of a novel framework for generating adversarial driving behavior of background vehicle interfering against the AV to expose effective and rational risky events. Specifically, the adversarial behavior is learned by a reinforcement learning (RL) approach incorporated with the cumulative prospect theory (CPT) which allows representation of human risk cognition. Then, the extended version of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) technique is proposed for training the adversarial policy while ensuring training stability as the CPT action-value function is leveraged.
