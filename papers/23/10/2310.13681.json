    "translated_abstract": "边缘设备参与联邦学习（FL）通常在设备-服务器通信的视角下进行研究（例如设备掉线），并假设边缘设备有持续参与FL的愿望。因此，在实际环境中实施当前的FL框架存在缺陷，许多框架遇到了驻泊者问题。为了将FL推向更真实的环境，我们提出了RealFM：第一个真正的联邦机制，它（1）实际地模拟设备效用，（2）激励数据贡献和设备参与，（3）可证明地消除了驻泊者现象。RealFM不需要数据共享，并允许模型准确性和效用之间存在非线性关系，相比于不参与和其他FL机制的设备，提高了服务器和参与设备的效用和数据贡献。在真实数据上，RealFM提高了设备和服务器的效用以及数据贡献，最多可达...",
