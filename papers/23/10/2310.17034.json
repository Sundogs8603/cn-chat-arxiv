    "translated_abstract": "声音助手（如Alexa或Siri）的使用已经快速增长，允许用户通过语音搜索即时获取信息。查询建议是基于屏幕的搜索体验的标准功能，允许用户探索更多话题。然而，在基于语音的设置中实现这一点并不是简单的任务。为了实现这一点，我们解决了一项新的任务，即通过简明自然的声音提示建议用户提问后续问题。我们定义了这个任务，将其基于句法理论，并概述了口语提示的语言期望。我们提出了基线模型和一种使用序列到序列 Transformer 的方法，从一系列问题中生成声音提示。通过一个由6681个输入问题和人工编写的提示组成的新数据集，我们使用自动评估指标和人工评估来评估模型。结果表明，简单地将建议的问题连接起来会产生低质量的声音提示。我们的方法采用了一种基于语言动机的预训练方法。",
