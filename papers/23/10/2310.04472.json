    "translated_abstract": "口号在建立公司品牌形象中起着至关重要的作用。口号被期望以令人难忘和讨人喜欢的方式反映公司的愿景和品牌的价值主张。自动化生成具有这些特点的口号是具有挑战性的。以往的研究发展和测试了具有句法控制和摘要模型的口号生成，但这些模型无法生成独特的口号。我们引入了一种新颖的方法，利用预训练的transformer T5模型和新提出的1:N匹配对数据集的噪声扰动。该方法在生成独特且连贯的口号方面起到了促进作用。此外，该方法将公司和品牌的描述纳入到口号生成中。我们根据ROUGE1、ROUGEL和余弦相似性指标评估生成的口号，并通过人为主体评估它们的独特性、连贯性和流畅性。结果显示o",
