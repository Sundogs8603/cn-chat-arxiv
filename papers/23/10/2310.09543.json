    "translated_abstract": "真实的物理引擎对于学习如何在模拟中操控可变形物体（如服装）起着至关重要的作用。通过这种方式，研究人员可以避免在真实世界中感知物体的变形等挑战。尽管大量使用模拟来完成这项任务，但很少有工作评估可变形物体模拟器和现实世界数据之间的真实差距。我们提供了一个基准数据集来评估布料操控中的模拟与现实差距。该数据集通过进行动态和准静态的布料操控任务以及与刚性桌子的接触来收集。我们使用该数据集评估了四个流行的可变形物体模拟器——MuJoCo、Bullet、Flex和SOFA的现实差距、计算时间和模拟稳定性。此外，我们还讨论了每个模拟器的优点和缺点。该基准数据集是开源的。附加材料、视频和代码可以在 https://sites.google.com/view/cloth-sim2r 找到。",
