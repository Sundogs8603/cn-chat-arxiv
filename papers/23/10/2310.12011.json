As a result, various automatic methods have been proposed to construct CSKG with larger semantic coverage. However, these unsupervised approaches introduce spurious noise that can lower the quality of the resulting CSKG, which cannot be tackled easily by existing denoising algorithms due to the unique characteristics of nodes and structures in CSKGs. To address this issue, we propose Gold (Global and Local-aware Denoising), a denoising framework for CSKGs that incorporates entity semantic information, global rules, and local structural information from the CSKG. Experiment results demonstrate that Gold outperforms all baseline methods in noise detection tasks on synthetic noisy CSKG benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that denoising a real-world CSKG is effective and even benefits the downstream zero-shot commonsense question-answering task.",

    "translated_abstract": "常识知识图（CSKG）对于常识推理至关重要，但通过人工注释构建它们可能成本高昂。因此，已经提出了各种自动方法来构建具有更大语义覆盖范围的CSKG。然而，这些无监督方法引入了假噪声，可能降低了生成的CSKG的质量，而现有的去噪算法由于CSKG中节点和结构的独特特征而难以解决这个问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了Gold（全球和局部意识去噪），这是一个针对CSKG的去噪框架，它结合了实体语义信息、全局规则和来自CSKG的局部结构信息。实验结果表明，在合成噪声CSKG基准上，Gold在噪声检测任务中优于所有基线方法。此外，我们还展示了去噪现实世界CSKG的有效性，甚至对下游的零样本常识问答任务有益。",
