    "translated_abstract": "使用生成对抗网络 (GAN) 进行心电图 (ECG) 信号合成已经得到广泛研究，因为实现12导联心电图并不总是可行的。GAN模型已经取得了显著的成果，但仅针对多导联输入进行设计，并且尚未确定GAN模型所保留的特征，限制了生成信号在心血管疾病预测模型中的应用。本文介绍了ECGNet，它是一种使用GAN框架、具有双向长短期记忆 (LSTM) 生成器和卷积神经网络 (CNN) 判别器的方法，从任何单导联输入生成完整的12导联心电图信号。对生成的信号进行交叉和自相关分析，识别出信号生成过程中保留的特征，即能够表征每个信号独特性的特征，因此很可能是心血管疾病的指标。最后，通过使用标注有心电图信号的数据集，证明了ECGNet的有效性。",
