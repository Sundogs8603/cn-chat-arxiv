    "translated_abstract": "在数字时代，网络安全已成为一个重要问题，随着每天计算机使用的增长。网络犯罪分子现在进行的不仅仅是病毒传播和计算机黑客行为。由于威胁到一个国家的生存，网络战争已经发展起来。恶意软件分析作为对抗攻击的第一道防线，并且是网络犯罪的重要组成部分。每天，恶意软件攻击目标众多的计算机用户、企业和政府机构，造成数十亿美元的损失。尽管安全专家拥有各种工具来识别恶意软件，但恶意软件可以通过其设计师进行微小巧妙的调整来规避多个杀毒软件的检测。为了应对这一挑战，开发了一个名为混淆恶意软件数据集(OMD)的新数据集。该数据集包含40个不同的恶意软件家族，有21924个样本，并且采用了模拟攻击者策略的混淆技术。",
