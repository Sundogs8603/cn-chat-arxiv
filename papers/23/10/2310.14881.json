    "translated_abstract": "现代组合优化的核心在于创建一个风险低且具有广泛资产多样化的组合。在马科维茨的开创性工作之后，可以使用基于经验协方差的约束优化模型来计算最优资产配置。然而，协方差通常是从历史回溯观察中估计得出的，容易受到噪音的干扰，并且可能不足以准确表示未来的市场行为。作为一种解决方法，可以利用网络科学中的信息过滤网络来减轻经验协方差估计中的噪音，从而为组合构建过程带来附加价值。在本文中，我们提出了使用统计鲁棒信息过滤网络（SR-IFN），它利用自助法来在网络形成过程中消除不必要的边，进一步提高网络的噪音减少能力。我们将SR-IFN应用于美国、英国和中国的指数成分股池，以评估其效果。",
