Second, the system automates the script orchestration via two LLM-based agents (Ruffle&Riley) with the roles of a student and a professor in a learning-by-teaching format. The system allows a free-form conversation that follows the ITS-typical outer-/inner-loop structure.

    "translated_abstract": "对话辅导系统（CTS）通过自然语言交互提供学习体验。它们被认为能够促进高水平的认知参与，并在推理任务中有益于学习成果。然而，撰写CTS内容所需的时间和成本是广泛应用的主要障碍。在本文中，我们介绍一种新型的CTS，它利用了大型语言模型（LLM）的最新进展：首先，该系统可以从教学文本自动诱导出辅导脚本。其次，该系统通过两个基于LLM的代理人（Ruffle&Riley）在学以教学的形式中自动协调脚本。该系统允许自由对话，遵循ITS典型的外部/内部循环结构。在一个初步的被试者在线用户研究（N = 100）中，将Ruffle&Riley与更简单的问答聊天机器人和阅读活动进行比较，我们发现在后测分数上没有显著差异。",
