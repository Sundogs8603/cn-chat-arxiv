    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）在知识图谱推理方面显示出了很好的性能。一种最近的GNN变体称为渐进关系图神经网络（PRGNN），利用关系规则推断关系有缺失的有向图，并取得了显著成果。然而，在使用PRGNN进行推理时，常常忽视了两个重要的属性：（1）关系组合的顺序性，不同关系的组合顺序影响着关系规则的语义；（2）滞后的实体信息传播，所需信息的传输速度落后于新实体的出现速度。忽视这些属性导致了错误的关系规则学习和推理准确性下降。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的知识图谱推理方法，称为关系规则增强图神经网络（RUN-GNN）。具体而言，RUN-GNN 使用与查询相关的融合门单元来建模顺序性。",
