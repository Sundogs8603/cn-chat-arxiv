    "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is a critical challenge in machine learning due to model overconfidence, often without awareness of their epistemological limits. We hypothesize that ``neural collapse'', a phenomenon affecting in-distribution data for models trained beyond loss convergence, also influences OOD data. To benefit from this interplay, we introduce NECO, a novel post-hoc method for OOD detection, which leverages the geometric properties of ``neural collapse'' and of principal component spaces to identify OOD data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NECO achieves state-of-the-art results on both small and large-scale OOD detection tasks while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across different network architectures. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of our method in OOD detection. We plan to release the code after the anonymity period.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于模型过于自信并且没有意识到其认识论限制，检测超出分布（OOD）数据是机器学习中的一个重要挑战。我们假设“神经坍塌”，一种影响超出分布数据的现象，也会影响超出分布数据。为了从这种相互作用中受益，我们引入了NECO，一种用于OOD检测的新颖的事后方法，它利用“神经坍塌”和主成分空间的几何属性来识别OOD数据。我们的大量实验表明，NECO在小规模和大规模OOD检测任务上取得了最先进的结果，同时在不同的网络架构上展示了强大的泛化能力。此外，我们还对我们的方法在OOD检测中的有效性提供了理论解释。我们计划在匿名期结束后发布代码。",
