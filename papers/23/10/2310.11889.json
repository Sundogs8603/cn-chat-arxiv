    "translated_abstract": "目前，最先进的网络模型基于离散事件仿真（DES）。虽然DES非常精确，但计算成本高，且难以并行化，使得模拟高性能网络变得不切实际。此外，模拟场景无法完全捕捉到真实网络场景中的所有复杂性。虽然存在基于机器学习（ML）技术的网络模型以减少这些问题，但这些模型也是利用模拟数据进行训练，因此容易受到相同的问题的影响。因此，图神经网络挑战赛2023引入了一组捕捉的流量跟踪数据集，可以用来构建没有这些限制的基于ML的网络模型。本文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的解决方案，专门设计用于更好地捕捉真实网络场景的复杂性。这是通过一种新颖的编码方法来从捕捉的数据包序列中捕捉信息实现的。",
