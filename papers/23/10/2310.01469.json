    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5, LLaMA, and PaLM, seem to be knowledgeable and able to adapt to many tasks. However, we still can not completely trust their answer, since LLMs suffer from hallucination--fabricating non-existent facts to cheat users without perception. And the reasons for their existence and pervasiveness remain unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that non-sense prompts composed of random tokens can also elicit the LLMs to respond with hallucinations. This phenomenon forces us to revisit that hallucination may be another view of adversarial examples, and it shares similar features with conventional adversarial examples as the basic feature of LLMs. Therefore, we formalize an automatic hallucination triggering method as the hallucination attack in an adversarial way. Finally, we explore basic feature of attacked adversarial prompts and propose a simple yet effective defense strategy. Our code is released on GitHub.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM），包括GPT-3.5、LLaMA和PaLM，似乎具有丰富的知识和适应多种任务的能力。然而，我们仍然不能完全信任它们的回答，因为LLM会出现幻觉，即捏造不存在的事实以欺骗用户而不被察觉。幻觉存在的原因和普遍性仍然不清楚。在本文中，我们证明了由随机标记组成的无意义提示也能引起LLM产生幻觉回应。这个现象迫使我们重新审视幻觉可能是对抗样本的另一种视角，并且它与常规的对抗样本具有类似的特征，作为LLM的基本特征。因此，我们以对抗的方式将自动幻觉触发方法形式化为幻觉攻击。最后，我们研究了被攻击的对抗提示的基本特征，并提出了一种简单而有效的防御策略。我们的代码已在GitHub上发布。",

This paper demonstrates that even random prompts can elicit hallucinations from LLMs, suggesting that hallucination may be another form of adversarial examples. It proposes an automatic hallucination triggering method as an adversarial attack and a simple yet effective defense strategy."
