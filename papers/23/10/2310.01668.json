    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）是一种用于图上机器学习的流行模型，通常遵循消息传递范式，在对邻居节点的信息进行聚合时，节点的特征会被递归地更新。虽然在输入图上交换消息赋予了GNNs强大的归纳偏置，但也使得GNNs容易过度压缩，从而无法捕捉给定图中的长程交互。为了解决这个问题，图重连技术被提出作为一种改善信息流的手段，通过改变图的连接性。在这项工作中，我们确定了图重连的三个期望：（i）减少过度压缩，（ii）尊重图的局部性，以及（iii）保持图的稀疏性。我们强调了空间和频谱重连技术之间存在的根本权衡；尽管前者通常满足（i）和（ii）但不满足（iii），后者通常在满足（i）和（iii）的同时牺牲了（ii）。",
