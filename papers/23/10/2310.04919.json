    "translated_abstract": "在现代科学研究中，目标通常是在大量可能的预测因素中确定与结果相关的变量。这个目标可以通过以控制误发现率（FDR）的方式来选择变量来实现，即在所选择的变量中，无关的预测因素的比例。Knockoff滤波是一种先进的变量选择方法，可以提供FDR控制。现有的Knockoff统计方法经常使用线性模型来评估特征和响应之间的关系，但是在线性模型在现实世界应用中常常被违反。这可能导致对真正预测变量的检测能力较差。我们引入了一种基于条件预测函数（CPF）的Knockoff统计方法，它可以与最先进的机器学习预测模型（如深度神经网络）配对使用。CPF统计方法可以捕捉预测变量和结果之间的非线性关系，同时还考虑了相关性。",
