    "translated_abstract": "在当今时代，自动驾驶汽车要求与飞机的安全水平相当。借鉴航空航天工业的经验，通过在V2X（车到一切）技术中建立冗余性，汽车行业也可以利用这个概念来实现高可靠性。鉴于当前缺乏可靠的V2X技术，这个想法尤其有前景。通过同时部署多个无线电接入技术（RATs），未来车辆的标准技术的持续争论可以得到解决。然而，由于动态的、时变的信道和不断变化的交通情况，协调多种通信技术是一项复杂的任务。本文采用深度强化学习（DRL）算法解决了V2X中的垂直切换问题。目标是在弯曲环境中帮助车辆选择最合适的V2X技术（DSRC/V-VLC）。结果显示，基准算法优于当前状态",
