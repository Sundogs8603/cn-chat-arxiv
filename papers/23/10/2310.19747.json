    "abstract": "Non-fungible token (NFT) market is a new trading invention based on the blockchain technology which parallels the cryptocurrency market. In the present work we study capitalization, floor price, the number of transactions, the inter-transaction times, and the transaction volume value of a few selected popular token collections. The results show that the fluctuations of all these quantities are characterized by heavy-tailed probability distribution functions, in most cases well described by the stretched exponentials, with a trace of power-law scaling at times, long-range memory, and in several cases even the fractal organization of fluctuations, mostly restricted to the larger fluctuations, however. We conclude that the NFT market - even though young and governed by a somewhat different mechanisms of trading - shares several statistical properties with the regular financial markets. However, some differences are visible in the specific quantitative indicators.",

    "translated_abstract": "非同质化代币（NFT）市场是一种基于区块链技术的新型交易创新，类似于加密货币市场。本研究针对几个热门代币集合的市值、底价、交易数量、交易间隔时间和交易量值进行了研究。结果表明，所有这些数量的波动特点都符合重尾概率分布函数，其中大多数情况下都可以用拉伸指数很好地描述，同时还存在一定的幂律尺度、长期记忆以及部分波动的分形组织，主要集中在较大的波动上。我们得出结论，尽管非同质化代币（NFT）市场年轻且受到一些不同的交易机制的规范，但与常规金融市场分享了几个统计特性。然而，一些具体的定量指标上存在一些差异。",
