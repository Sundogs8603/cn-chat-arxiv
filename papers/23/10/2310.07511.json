    "translated_abstract": "遥感异常检测器可以找到与背景不符的目标作为潜在目标。鉴于地球异常类型的多样性，跨模态和场景的统一异常检测器应该具有成本效益，并且对于新的地球观测源和异常类型具有灵活性。然而，当前的异常检测器仅限于单一模态和单一场景，因为它们旨在学习不断变化的背景分布。在普遍的异常偏差模式的激发下，即异常展现出与其局部环境的偏差特点，我们利用这一特征构建了一个统一的异常检测器。首先，我们将异常检测任务重新定义为基于偏差关系的无向双层图，其中异常评分被建模为在背景和正常对象的模式给定下的条件概率。然后，学习目标被表示为一个条件概率排序问题。此外，我们设计了一种实例化方案。",
