    "translated_abstract": "由于其在各个领域中的应用，从扫描文档中提取关键信息（KIE）引起了越来越多的关注。虽然一些最近的KIE方法取得了令人期待的结果，但它们通常是基于判别模型构建的，这些模型缺乏处理光学字符识别（OCR）错误的能力，需要费力的记号级标注。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的生成式端到端模型，名为GenKIE，来解决KIE任务。GenKIE是一个序列到序列的多模态生成模型，利用多模态编码器嵌入视觉、布局和文本特征，并使用解码器生成所需的输出。设计良好的提示被利用来将标签语义作为弱监督信号并激发关键信息的生成。生成模型的一个显着优势是它可以自动纠正OCR错误。此外，不需要记号级的粒度注释。",
