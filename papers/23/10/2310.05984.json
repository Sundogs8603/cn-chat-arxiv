    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体经常因为放大有害言论和阻碍建设性对话而受到批评。但是设计促进更好对话的社交媒体平台本质上是具有挑战性的。本论文探讨了通过使用大型语言模型（LLM）和基于代理模型的建模来模拟社交媒体是否有助于研究不同新闻供稿算法对在线对话质量的影响。我们使用美国全国选举研究的数据创建逼真的人物形象，以填充模拟社交媒体平台。接下来，我们让这些代理人阅读和分享新闻文章，并在三个使用不同新闻供稿算法的平台上对其它用户的信息点赞或评论。在第一个平台上，用户可以看到他们关注的用户中得到最多点赞和评论的帖子。在第二个平台上，他们可以看到来自所有用户的帖子，即使是来自自己网络之外的用户。第三个平台采用了一种新颖的“桥接”算法，突出显示帖子。",

By creating realistic personas and using different algorithms, the study finds that news feed algorithms play a significant role in shaping social media dialogues."
