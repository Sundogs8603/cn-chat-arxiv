    "translated_abstract": "多变量时间序列中的异常检测已经成为时间序列研究中的一个重要挑战，在欺诈检测、故障诊断和系统状态估计等各个领域具有重要的研究影响。近年来，基于重建的模型在检测时间序列数据中的异常方面显示出了很大的潜力。然而，由于数据规模和维度的快速增加，时间序列重建过程中的噪声和弱身份映射问题越来越突出。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种新的自适应动态邻居掩膜机制(ADNM)，将其与Transformer和去噪扩散模型相结合，创建了一种名为Denoising Diffusion Mask Transformer (DDMT) 的新框架，用于多变量时间序列异常检测。ADNM模块用于减轻数据重建过程中输入和输出特征之间的信息泄漏问题，从而缓解了弱身份映射问题。",
