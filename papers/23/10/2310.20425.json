    "translated_abstract": "物理和机器学习的交叉已经催生了一种我们在这里称之为物理增强机器学习 (PEML) 的范式，旨在提高数据或物理方法的能力和减少各自的缺点。本文通过对其特征、用法和动机的全面探索来讨论物理增强机器学习方法的光谱，涵盖了物理和数据这两个定义轴。在这样做的过程中，本文提供了对PEML技术的最新应用和发展的调查，揭示了PEML在应对复杂挑战方面的潜力。我们进一步演示了在单自由度Duffing振子的简单工作示例上选择这种方法的应用，从而突出了不同“类型”PEML方法的个体特征和动机。为了促进合作和透明度，并为读者提供实际的示例，本文完整地记录了所采取的方法和模型。",
