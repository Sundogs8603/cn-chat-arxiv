    "translated_abstract": "命名实体识别（NER）在细粒度NER场景下常常面临标注数据不足的问题。虽然可以应用K-shot学习技术，但当注释数量超过几十个标签时，性能往往达到饱和。为了解决这个问题，我们利用现有的粗粒度数据集，其中包含大量的标注。一种直接解决这个问题的方法是预训练，它利用粗粒度数据进行表示学习。然而，它无法直接利用细粒度和粗粒度实体之间的关系，尽管细粒度实体类型很可能是粗粒度实体类型的子类别。我们提出了一个带有细粒度-粗粒度（F2C）映射矩阵的细粒度NER模型，以显式地利用层次结构。此外，我们提出了一种不一致性过滤方法，以消除与细粒度不一致的粗粒度实体。",
