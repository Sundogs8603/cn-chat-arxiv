    "translated_abstract": "时间序列预测是一个广泛研究的主题，广泛应用于天气预报、交通控制和股票价格预测等领域。时间序列中的极端值通常对人类和自然系统产生重大影响，但由于其罕见性，预测这些值是具有挑战性的。基于极值理论 (EVT) 的统计方法提供了一种系统的建模极值分布的方法，特别是广义帕累托 (GP) 分布用于建模超过阈值的分布。为了克服深度学习在处理重尾数据方面的不理想表现，我们提出了一种增强对极端事件关注的新框架。具体而言，我们提出了一种基于自编码器的深度极端混合模型 (DEMMA) 用于时间序列预测。该模型包括两个主要模块：1) 基于障碍模型的广义混合分布和与极端阈值无关的重参数化 GP 分布形式，2) 一个用于学习极端事件的自编码器。",
