    "translated_abstract": "当数据被自适应地收集时，统计学中的估计和推断面临重大挑战。即使在线性模型中，最小二乘估计器（OLS）在单个坐标估计和误差膨胀方面可能无法展现渐近正态性。最近的极小极限显示了这个问题，指出当数据允许任意自适应性时，估计单个坐标的误差可以增加一个$\\sqrt{d}$倍，与i.i.d.情况相比。我们的工作探讨了在利用i.i.d.和自适应数据时估计性能之间的显著差异。我们研究了数据收集中的自适应程度如何影响高维线性模型中估计低维参数组成的性能。我们确定了数据收集机制条件，使得低维参数组成的估计误差在i.i.d.情况下与其相匹配，只差一个f倍。",
