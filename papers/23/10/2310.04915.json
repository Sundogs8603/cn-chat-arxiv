    "translated_abstract": "在SE(3)不变空间中，基于扩散的生成模型在分子构象生成方面表现出有希望的性能，但通常需要解决具有数千个更新步骤的随机微分方程(SDEs)。迄今为止，如何在SE(3)不变空间中明确有效地加速这个过程仍然不清楚，这极大地阻碍了其在实际环境中的广泛应用。在本文中，我们通过现有方法引起的近似误差来系统研究SE(3)不变空间中的扩散机制。因此，我们在投影微分方程的上下文中发展了更精确的SE(3)内的近似方法。我们还提供了理论分析，并通过实证验证将超参数与这些误差联系起来。总体而言，我们提出了一种新的加速方案，用于在SE(3)不变空间中生成分子构象。实验结果表明，我们的方案可以以50倍到100倍的速度生成高质量的构象。",
