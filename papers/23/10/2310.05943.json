    "abstract": "For applications like plant disease detection, usually, a model is trained on publicly available data and tested on field data. This means that the test data distribution is not the same as the training data distribution, which affects the classifier performance adversely. We handle this dataset shift by ensuring that the features are learned from disease spots in the leaf or healthy regions, as applicable. This is achieved using a faster Region-based convolutional neural network (RCNN) as one of the solutions and an attention-based network as the other. The average classification accuracies of these classifiers are approximately 95% while evaluated on the test set corresponding to their training dataset. These classifiers also performed equivalently, with an average score of 84% on a dataset not seen during the training phase.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于诸如植物病害检测之类的应用，通常会在公开可用的数据上对模型进行训练，并在田间数据上进行测试。这意味着测试数据分布与训练数据分布不同，从而对分类器的性能产生不利影响。我们通过确保特征从叶片上的病斑或健康区域中学习来处理这种数据集变化。其中一种解决方案是使用更快的基于区域的卷积神经网络（RCNN），另一种是使用基于注意力的网络。这些分类器在其对应训练数据集的测试集上的平均分类准确率约为95％。这些分类器还在训练阶段未见过的数据集上表现相当，平均得分为84％。",
