    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于信任域的在线策略强化学习在解决复杂控制任务和游戏场景方面取得了令人瞩目的结果。然而，这一类别中现有的最先进算法主要强调对预期性能的改进，缺乏对最坏情况下性能结果的控制能力。为了解决这个限制，我们引入了一个新颖的目标函数；通过优化该函数，可以确保近乎总体性能样本的下界（绝对性能）呈现单调改进。考虑到这一具有突破性的理论进展，我们通过一系列的近似对这个理论基础算法进行了改进，得到了一种实用的解决方案称为绝对策略优化（APO）。我们的实验证明了我们的方法在具有挑战性的连续控制基准任务上的有效性，并将其适用性扩展到掌握Atari游戏。我们的发现表明，APO在提高性能的同时也显著改善了最坏情况下的性能结果。",
