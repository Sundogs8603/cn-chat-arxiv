    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）已经在解决图相关问题，包括节点分类方面显示出了潜力。然而，传统的GNN假设数据在各个类别之间均匀分布，而在现实世界的情境中，某些类别往往严重不平衡。这导致标准GNN在不平衡图上性能不佳。本文通过考虑图的异质性，引入了一种独特的方法来处理图上的不平衡分类问题。我们研究了类别不平衡与图的异质性之间的复杂关系，揭示了少数类不仅表现出样本稀缺，还表现出较低的同质性水平，从而促进了错误信息在相邻节点之间的传播。基于这一洞察，我们提出了一种高效的方法，称为Fast Im-GBK，它将不平衡分类策略与异质性感知的GNN有效地结合起来，以解决类别不平衡问题。",
