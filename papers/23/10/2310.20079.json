    "translated_abstract": "尽管被称为托卡马克的聚变反应堆作为一种可靠的能源来源而备受期待，但为了使其经济可行，需要在等离子体控制和处理失控等事件方面取得进展。应用更先进的控制算法面临一个重大瓶颈，即需要更好的等离子体模拟，目前基于物理和数据驱动的方法都存在问题。前者受到计算成本和建模等难题的限制，后者受到数据相对匮乏的限制。为了解决这个问题，本研究将神经常微分方程（Neural ODE）框架应用于预测等离子体动力学的子集，即耦合等离子体电流和内部感应动力学。由于神经ODE框架能够自然地包含基于物理的偏置，我们在Alcator C-Mod聚变反应堆的数据上训练了基于物理和神经网络模型，并发现神经ODE模型可以更好地预测等离子体动力学。",
