    "abstract": "Creating music is iterative, requiring varied methods at each stage. However, existing AI music systems fall short in orchestrating multiple subsystems for diverse needs. To address this gap, we introduce Loop Copilot, a novel system that enables users to generate and iteratively refine music through an interactive, multi-round dialogue interface. The system uses a large language model to interpret user intentions and select appropriate AI models for task execution. Each backend model is specialized for a specific task, and their outputs are aggregated to meet the user's requirements. To ensure musical coherence, essential attributes are maintained in a centralized table. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, highlighting its utility not only in facilitating music creation but also its potential for broader applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "创建音乐是一个迭代过程，每个阶段都需要不同的方法。然而，现有的AI音乐系统在组织多个子系统以满足不同需求方面存在不足。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了Loop Copilot，这是一个能够通过交互式、多轮对话界面生成和迭代改进音乐的新型系统。该系统使用一种大型语言模型来解释用户意图，并选择适当的AI模型进行任务执行。每个后端模型都专门针对特定任务，并将它们的输出聚合起来以满足用户的要求。为了确保音乐的连贯性，关键属性被保留在一个集中的表中。我们通过半结构化的访谈和问卷调查评估了所提出的系统的有效性，突出了它在促进音乐创作方面的实用性，以及它在更广泛应用中的潜力。",
