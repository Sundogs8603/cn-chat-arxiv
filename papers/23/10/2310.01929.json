    "translated_abstract": "文本到图像（TTI）模型，例如DALL-E和StableDiffusion，在通过文本提示生成图像的零射模式方面具有卓越的能力，近来备受关注。作为文化的媒介，语言在这些模型的多语言能力中起着关键作用，从而塑造了它们的文化机制。在本研究中，我们通过描述文化维度，文化领域和文化概念的三个层次来探索TTI模型中嵌入的文化感知。我们提出了一套全面的评估技术，包括使用CLIP空间进行内在评估，使用视觉问答（VQA）模型进行外在评估以及人类评估，以识别TTI文化感知。为了促进我们的研究，我们引入了CulText2I数据集，该数据集来自四个不同的TTI模型，涵盖了十种语言。我们的实验揭示了这些模型的文化意识、文化区别和",
