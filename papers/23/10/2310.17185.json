    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种适应性采样方法，用于解决偏微分方程的Deep Ritz方法。我们使用两个深度神经网络。一个网络用于逼近偏微分方程的解，而另一个网络是一个深度生成模型，用于生成新的插值点以改进训练集。适应性采样过程包括两个主要步骤。第一步是使用Deep Ritz方法通过最小化与训练集中的插值点离散化相关的变分损失来求解偏微分方程。第二步涉及生成一个新的训练集，然后在后续计算中使用该训练集进一步提高当前近似解的准确性。我们将变分损失中的被积函数视为一个非标准化的概率密度函数（PDF），并使用称为有界KRnet的深度生成模型进行近似。新的样本及其相关的PDF值是从有界KRnet中获取的。",
