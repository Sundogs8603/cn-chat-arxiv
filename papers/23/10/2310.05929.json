    "abstract": "We have developed a comprehensive computer system to assist farmers who practice traditional farming methods and have limited access to agricultural experts for addressing crop diseases. Our system utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and provide remedies for vegetable diseases. To ensure ease of use, we have created a mobile application that offers a user-friendly interface, allowing farmers to inquire about vegetable diseases and receive suitable solutions in their local language. The developed system can be utilized by any farmer with a basic understanding of a smartphone. Specifically, we have designed an AI-enabled mobile application for identifying and suggesting remedies for vegetable diseases, focusing on tomato diseases to benefit the local farming community in Nepal. Our system employs state-of-the-art object detection methodology, namely You Only Look Once (YOLO), to detect tomato diseases. The detected information is then relayed to the mobile application, whic",
