    "translated_abstract": "在具有时延潜在因果影响的时序数据的无监督因果表示学习中，通过利用时间结构在稳态情况下已经建立了有关因果相关潜在变量解缠的强可识别性结果。然而，在非平稳情况下，现有研究只部分解决了这个问题，要么利用观测到的辅助变量（如类别标签和/或域索引）作为辅助信息，要么假设简化的潜在因果动力学。这两者限制了方法的适用范围。在本研究中，我们进一步探索了非平稳环境中时间延迟相关过程的马尔可夫假设，并证明了在温和条件下，可以在不观察辅助变量的情况下从非线性混合中恢复独立的潜在分量，但可能存在排列和分量级转换。然后，我们引入了一个有原则的估计框架NCTRL来实现。",
