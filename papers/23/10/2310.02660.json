    "translated_abstract": "自1950年以来，印度通过一个精心设计的预留制度，实施了一项复杂的平权行动计划。该制度融合了垂直和水平的预留，以解决历史上被边缘化群体的社会经济失衡问题。垂直预留为公共教育机构和政府就业岗位指定了特定的配额，供应安排给“计划种姓”、“计划部落”、“其他落后阶层”和“经济弱势群体”。同时，在每个垂直类别内，还采用了水平预留，为其他子群体，如妇女和残疾人，分配职位。在教育招生中，法律框架建议未被垂直类别占满的职位恢复为非预留状态。此外，我们还记录到，来自垂直预留类别的个人对于机构-垂直类别职位对有更复杂的偏好，尽管当局要求他们按优先顺序申请这些职位。",
