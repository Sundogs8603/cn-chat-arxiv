    "translated_title": "联邦学习中的数字伦理问题",
    "translated_abstract": "物联网（IoT）不断产生大量数据，引发了对数据隐私保护和数据滥用限制的越来越多的关注。联邦学习（FL）通过共享机器学习（ML）模型参数而不是原始用户数据，促进了多方之间的协作能力，并因其在隐私保护和学习效率提升方面的潜力而引起了广泛关注。本文重点讨论了在FL中作为客户端的以人为中心的设备引发的数字伦理问题。具体而言，在客户端和服务器之间存在不同的观点和目标的情况下，FL面临着游戏动态、公平性、奖励机制和连贯性等挑战。我们从客户端和服务器的角度，以及集中式和分散式FL的视角分析了这些挑战及其解决方案。最后，我们探讨了以人为中心的物联网在FL中的机遇。",
