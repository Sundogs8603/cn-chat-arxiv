    "translated_abstract": "基于学习模型的树搜索规划能力的代理在经典决策问题，如围棋和Atari上取得了显著的成功。然而，在涉及复杂行动空间和显著仿真成本或固有随机性的真实世界应用中，将蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）算法扩展到具有挑战性甚至不可行。在这项工作中，我们介绍了LightZero，第一个用于在普遍顺序决策场景中部署MCTS/MuZero的统一基准。具体而言，我们总结了在设计普通MCTS风格决策求解器时所面临的最关键挑战，然后将树搜索RL方法的紧密耦合算法和系统设计分解为不同的子模块。通过结合更合适的探索和优化策略，我们可以明显增强这些子模块，并构建强大的LightZero代理以应对各种任务。",
