    "translated_abstract": "在现代推荐系统中，如何针对新用户有效地进行推荐，即冷启动问题，一直是一个长期存在的挑战。我们提出了个人知识图谱（PKG）作为一个领域不变的兴趣表示，并提出了一种名为MeKB-Rec的新型跨领域推荐范式。我们首先将知识图谱中的用户和实体进行关联，构建了用户兴趣的PKG，即MeKB。然后我们学习了MeKB的语义表示，用于跨领域推荐。为了高效利用CDR中有限的训练数据，MeKB-Rec采用了预训练语言模型将世界知识注入到对用户兴趣的理解中。与大多数现有系统不同，我们的方法在领域之间建立了语义映射，消除了对领域内用户行为的要求，实现了对新用户的零-shot推荐。",
