    "abstract": "Mainstream navigation software, like Google and Apple Maps, often lacks the ability to provide routes prioritizing safety. However, safety remains a paramount concern for many. Our aim is to strike a balance between safety and efficiency. To achieve this, we're devising an Integer Programming model that takes into account both the shortest path and the safest route. We will harness machine learning to derive safety coefficients, employing methodologies such as generalized linear models, linear regression, and recurrent neural networks. Our evaluation will be based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) across various subway stations, helping us identify the most accurate model for safety coefficient estimation. Furthermore, we'll conduct a comprehensive review of different shortest-path algorithms, assessing them based on time complexity and real-world data to determine their appropriateness in merging both safety and time efficiency.",

    "translated_abstract": "主流导航软件如谷歌地图和苹果地图往往缺乏提供以安全为优先的路线的能力。然而，安全始终是许多人关注的重点。我们的目标是在安全和效率之间取得平衡。为了实现这一目标，我们正在设计一个整数规划模型，考虑最短路径和最安全路线的因素。我们将利用机器学习来推导安全系数，采用广义线性模型、线性回归和循环神经网络等方法。我们的评估将基于各个地铁站的均方根误差（RMSE），帮助我们确定最准确的安全系数估计模型。此外，我们还将对不同的最短路径算法进行全面评估，根据时间复杂度和真实世界数据评估它们在同时考虑安全和时间效率方面的适用性。",
