    "abstract": "The practice of marriage is an understudied phenomenon in behavioural sciences despite being ubiquitous across human cultures. This modelling paper shows that replacing distant direct kin with in-laws increases the interconnectedness of the family social network graph, which allows more cooperative and larger groups. In this framing, marriage can be seen as a social technology that reduces free-riding within collaborative group. This approach offers a solution to the puzzle of why our species has this particular form of regulating mating behaviour, uniquely among pair-bonded animals.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管婚姻在人类文化中普遍存在，但它在行为科学中仍然是一个研究不足的现象。本建模论文表明，将远亲变成亲家增加了家庭社交网络图的相互联系，从而使得更多的合作和更大的群体成为可能。从这个角度来看，婚姻可以被视为一种减少合作群体内部搭便车现象的社交技术。这种方法提供了一个解决之 puzzle 的解释，即为什么我们的物种在调节交配行为方面有着这种特殊形式，这在配对结合的动物中是独特的。",
