    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于深度学习和大规模标注数据的可用性，槽填充在发展过程中取得了很大的进展。然而，处理在训练期间从未见过的新领域带来了一个关键挑战。由于严重的领域转移，识别性能可能会大大降低。大多数之前的工作通过基于度量学习的两次传递流程来处理这个问题。但实际上，这些主导流水线模型可能在计算效率和泛化能力方面受限，因为存在非并行推理和无上下文离散标签嵌入。为此，我们重新审视了典型的基于度量的方法，并提出了一种新的适应性端到端度量学习方案，针对挑战性的零样本槽填充。考虑到简洁性、高效性和泛化性，我们提出了一种级联式联合学习框架，配合上下文感知的软标签表示和槽级对比表示学习，以减轻领域转移带来的挑战。",
