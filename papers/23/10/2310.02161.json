Prior research and our formative study found that people would benefit from reading an overview of an information space upfront, including the criteria others previously found useful. However, existing sensemaking tools struggle with the \"cold-start\" problem -- it not only requires significant input from previous users to generate and share these overviews, but such overviews may also turn out to be biased and incomplete. In this work, we introduce a novel system, Selenite, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as reasoning machines and knowledge retrievers to automatically produce a comprehensive overview of options and criteria to jumpstart users' sensemaking processes. Subsequently, Selenite also adapts as people use it, helping users find, read, and navigate unfamiliar information in a systematic yet personalized manner. Thro",

    "translated_abstract": "在陌生领域进行意义建构可能很具挑战性，要求用户耗费大量努力比较不同选项在各个标准上的差异。之前的研究和我们的形式化研究发现，人们阅读信息空间的概览可以获益，其中包括之前其他人发现有用的标准。然而，现有的意义建构工具面临着“冷启动”问题，不仅需要先前用户的大量输入来生成和分享这些概览，而且这些概览可能也会被证明是有偏见和不完整的。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一个新颖的系统Selenite，它利用大型语言模型作为推理机和知识检索器，自动产生全面的选项和标准概览，以启动用户的意义建构过程。随后，Selenite还会随着用户的使用而进行适应，帮助用户以系统而个性化的方式找到、阅读和导航陌生的信息。",
