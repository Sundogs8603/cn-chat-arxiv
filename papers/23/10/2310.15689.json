    "abstract": "Patents are legal documents that aim at protecting inventions on the one hand and at making technical knowledge circulate on the other. Their complex style -- a mix of legal, technical, and extremely vague language -- makes their content hard to access for humans and machines and poses substantial challenges to the information retrieval community. This paper proposes an approach to automatically simplify patent text through rephrasing. Since no in-domain parallel simplification data exist, we propose a method to automatically generate a large-scale silver standard for patent sentences. To obtain candidates, we use a general-domain paraphrasing system; however, the process is error-prone and difficult to control. Thus, we pair it with proper filters and construct a cleaner corpus that can successfully be used to train a simplification system. Human evaluation of the synthetic silver corpus shows that it is considered grammatical, adequate, and contains simple sentences.",

    "translated_abstract": "专利是旨在一方面保护发明，另一方面促进技术知识流通的法律文件。由于其复杂的风格，即法律、技术和极度模糊的语言的混合，使得人类和机器难以获取其内容，并对信息检索社区提出了重大挑战。本文提出了一种通过改写自动简化专利文本的方法。由于缺乏领域内并行的简化数据，我们提出了一种自动生成大规模专利句子银标准的方法。为了获得候选句子，我们使用了一个通用域的改写系统；然而，这个过程容易出错且难以控制。因此，我们将其与适当的过滤器配对，并构建了一个更干净的语料库，可以成功用于训练一个简化系统。对合成银标准语料库的人工评估表明，它被认为是符合语法、适度且包含简单句子的。",
