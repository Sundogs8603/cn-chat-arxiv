    "abstract": "The ability to detect intent in dialogue systems has become increasingly important in modern technology. These systems often generate a large amount of unlabeled data, and manually labeling this data requires substantial human effort. Semi-supervised methods attempt to remedy this cost by using a model trained on a few labeled examples and then by assigning pseudo-labels to further a subset of unlabeled examples that has a model prediction confidence higher than a certain threshold. However, one particularly perilous consequence of these methods is the risk of picking an imbalanced set of examples across classes, which could lead to poor labels. In the present work, we describe Top-K K-Nearest Neighbor (TK-KNN), which uses a more robust pseudo-labeling approach based on distance in the embedding space while maintaining a balanced set of pseudo-labeled examples across classes through a ranking-based approach.

    "translated_abstract": "在现代技术中，检测对话系统中的意图变得越来越重要。这些系统往往产生大量的未标记数据，手动标记这些数据需要大量的人力。半监督方法试图通过使用在少量标记示例上训练的模型，并为预测置信度高于某个阈值的未标记示例分配伪标签来减少成本。然而，这些方法的一个特别危险的后果是在各类别之间选择不平衡的示例集，可能导致标签质量较差。在本研究中，我们描述了一种基于嵌入空间距离的更稳健的伪标签方法Top-K K-Nearest Neighbor (TK-KNN)，通过基于排名的方法在类别之间维持一个平衡的伪标签示例集。在几个数据集上的实验表明，TK-KNN的性能优于现有模型。",
