    "abstract": "This paper develops a coupled model for day-ahead electricity prices and average daily temperature which allows to model quanto weather and energy derivatives. These products have gained on popularity as they enable to hedge against both volumetric and price risks. Electricity day-ahead prices and average daily temperatures are modelled through non homogeneous Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes driven by a Brownian motion and a Normal Inverse Gaussian L\\'evy process, which allows to include dependence between them. A Conditional Least Square method is developed to estimate the different parameters of the model and used on real data. Then, explicit and semi-explicit formulas are obtained for derivatives including quanto options and compared with Monte Carlo simulations. Last, we develop explicit formulas to hedge statically single and double sided quanto options by a portfolio of electricity options and temperature options (CDD or HDD).",

    "translated_abstract": "本文开发了一个耦合模型，用于建模量化天气和能源衍生品的电力日前价格和日平均温度。这些产品以其能对抗体量和价格风险而受到欢迎。通过由布朗运动和正倒Gaussian L\\'evy过程驱动的非齐次Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程对电力日前价格和日平均温度进行建模，从而允许在它们之间包含关联。开发了条件最小二乘法来估计模型的不同参数，并在实际数据上进行应用。随后，得到了包括量化期权在内的衍生品的明确和半明确公式，并与蒙特卡洛模拟进行了比较。最后，我们开发了明确的公式以通过电力期权和温度期权（CDD或HDD）的组合来对单向和双向量化期权进行静态对冲。",
