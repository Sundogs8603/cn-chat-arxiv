    "abstract": "The quality of explanations for the predictions of complex machine learning predictors is often measured using insertion and deletion metrics, which assess the faithfulness of the explanations, i.e., how correctly the explanations reflect the predictor's behavior. To improve the faithfulness, we propose insertion/deletion metric-aware explanation-based optimization (ID-ExpO), which optimizes differentiable predictors to improve both insertion and deletion scores of the explanations while keeping their predictive accuracy. Since the original insertion and deletion metrics are indifferentiable with respect to the explanations and directly unavailable for gradient-based optimization, we extend the metrics to be differentiable and use them to formalize insertion and deletion metric-based regularizers.

    "translated_abstract": "复杂机器学习预测器的解释质量通常使用插入和删除指标进行衡量，这些指标评估解释的忠实度，即解释正确地反映了预测器的行为程度。为了提高忠实度，我们提出了插入/删除指标感知的基于解释的优化（ID-ExpO），该优化能够改善解释的插入和删除得分，同时保持其预测准确性。由于原始的插入和删除指标对于解释来说是不可区分的，并且无法直接进行基于梯度的优化，我们扩展了这些指标以使其可区分，并将其用于形式化插入和删除指标的正则化。在图像和表格数据集上的实验结果表明，使用ID-ExpO进行微调的基于深度神经网络的预测器能够使流行的事后解释器产生更忠实的解释。",
