Relying on the general tools from algebraic signal processing (ASP), we study the filtering and stability properties of non commutative convolutional filters. We show how non commutative filters can be stable to small perturbations on the space of operators. We also show that although the spectral components of the Fourier representation in a non commutative signal model are associated to spaces of dimension larger than one, there is a trade-off between stability and selectivity similar to that observed for commutative models. Our results have direct implications for group neural networks, multigraph neural networks and quaternion neural networks, among other non commutative architectures. We conclude by corroborating these results through numerical experiments.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文讨论了最近在[1]中发表的基于非交换代数的代数信号模型(ASM)以及它们在卷积神经网络中的应用。借助代数信号处理(ASP)的一般工具，我们研究了非交换卷积滤波器的滤波和稳定特性。我们展示了非交换滤波器在算子空间的小扰动下可以保持稳定。我们还展示了尽管非交换信号模型中的傅里叶表示的谱分量与维度大于1的空间相关联，但在稳定性和选择性之间存在类似于交换模型的权衡。我们的结果对于群神经网络、多图神经网络和四元神经网络等非交换结构具有直接的影响。最后我们通过数值实验验证了这些结果。",
