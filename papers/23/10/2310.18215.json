    "translated_abstract": "随着打车服务需求的增长，对准确的出租车需求预测的需求也在增加。现有系统仅限于特定地区，缺乏对未知地区的泛化能力。本文提出了一种新颖的出租车需求预测系统，利用图神经网络捕捉城市环境中的空间依赖性和模式。此外，该系统采用了一种区域中立的方法，使其能够训练一个模型，适用于任何地区，包括未知地区。为了实现这一点，该框架利用变分自动编码器将输入特征分开为区域特定和区域中立的部分。区域中立特征有助于交叉地区出租车需求预测，使模型能够在不同城市地区具有良好的泛化能力。实验证明了该系统在准确预测出租车需求方面的效果，甚至在以前未观察到的地区也是如此。",
