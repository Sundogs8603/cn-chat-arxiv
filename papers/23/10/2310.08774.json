    "translated_abstract": "系统发育学是计算生物学的一个分支，研究生物实体之间的进化关系。尽管有着悠久的历史和众多应用，但从序列数据推断系统发育树仍然具有挑战性：树空间的高复杂性对当前的组合和概率技术构成了重要障碍。在本文中，我们采用生成流网络（GFlowNets）的框架来解决系统发育学中的两个核心问题：基于最简原则的和贝叶斯的系统发育推断。由于GFlowNets适用于采样复杂的组合结构，它们是探索和采样树拓扑和进化距离的多模态后验分布的自然选择。我们证明了我们的摊还后验采样器PhyloGFN在真实基准数据集上产生多样且高质量的进化假设。PhyloGFN在边缘似然估计方面与之前的工作相比具有竞争力。",
