    "translated_abstract": "数据采集、存储和处理技术的进步导致了异质医学数据的快速增长。将放射学扫描、组织病理学图像和分子信息与临床数据整合是开发对疾病有全面理解和优化治疗至关重要的。在复杂疾病（如癌症）中，将来自多个来源的数据进行整合的需求更加突出，以实现精准医学和个性化治疗。本研究提出了多模态肿瘤数据系统（MINDS）-一种灵活、可扩展且经济高效的元数据框架，用于将来自公共来源（如癌症研究数据共享库）的异构数据有效地融合到一个相互连接且以患者为中心的框架中。MINDS提供了一个可以探索不同数据类型之间关系并构建大规模多模态机器学习模型的界面。通过协调多模态数据，MINDS旨在实现促进研究创新、精准医学和个性化治疗的目标。",
