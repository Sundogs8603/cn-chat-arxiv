    "abstract": "Many natural materials exhibit highly complex, nonlinear, anisotropic, and heterogeneous mechanical properties. Recently, it has been demonstrated that data-driven strain energy functions possess the flexibility to capture the behavior of these complex materials with high accuracy while satisfying physics-based constraints. However, most of these approaches disregard the uncertainty in the estimates and the spatial heterogeneity of these materials. In this work, we leverage recent advances in generative models to address these issues. We use as building block neural ordinary equations (NODE) that -- by construction -- create polyconvex strain energy functions, a key property of realistic hyperelastic material models. We combine this approach with probabilistic diffusion models to generate new samples of strain energy functions. This technique allows us to sample a vector of Gaussian white noise and translate it to NODE parameters thereby representing plausible strain energy functions. ",

    "translated_abstract": "许多自然材料表现出高度复杂、非线性、各向异性和异质性的力学特性。最近，已经证明数据驱动的应变能函数具有灵活性，可以以高精度捕捉这些复杂材料的行为，同时满足基于物理的约束条件。然而，大多数这些方法忽略了估计的不确定性和材料的空间异质性。在这项工作中，我们利用生成模型的最新进展来解决这些问题。我们使用神经常微分方程（NODE）作为建模基础，通过构造可以创建多凸应变能函数，这是实际的超弹性材料模型的关键特性。我们结合这种方法与概率扩散模型生成应变能函数的新样本。这种技术允许我们对高斯白噪声进行采样并将其转换为NODE参数，从而代表可行的应变能函数。",
