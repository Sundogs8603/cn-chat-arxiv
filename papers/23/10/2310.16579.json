    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，我们目睹了在社交媒体上迅速传播并令公众震惊的虚假和未经证实的信息（即谣言）的爆发。谣言可以引发社交媒体用户之间多样化但大多具有争议性的立场表达。谣言验证和立场检测是不同但相关的任务。假新闻揭穿主要关注确定新闻文章的真实性，这过于简化了问题，因为假新闻经常结合了真实性和虚假性的元素。因此，识别文章中特定的误导性信息实例变得至关重要。在这项研究中，我们调查了假新闻揭穿领域中的一项新任务，即检测句子级别的误导性信息。这项任务面临的主要挑战之一是缺乏具有句子级别真实性注释的训练数据集。受到多实例学习（MIL）方法的启发，我们提出了一种名为Weakly Supervised Detection of Misinforming Se的模型。",
