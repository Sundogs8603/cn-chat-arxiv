    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant interest in the development of machine learning-based optimization proxies for AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF).

This paper addresses this gap by training optimization proxies for a convex relaxation of AC-OPF.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人们对基于机器学习的交流最优功率流问题（AC-OPF）优化代理的发展表现出了极大的兴趣。虽然在预测高质量原始解方面取得了显著进展，但现有的基于学习的方法无法为AC-OPF提供有效的对偶界限。本文通过训练AC-OPF的一个凸松弛的优化代理来填补这一空白。具体而言，本文考虑了AC-OPF的二阶圆锥（SOC）松弛，并提出了一种新的对偶架构，嵌入了一个快速、可微分的（对偶）可行性恢复，从而提供有效的对偶界限。本文将这种新架构与自监督学习方案相结合，减轻了昂贵的训练数据生成需求。对中等和大规模电力网络进行了大量的数值实验，证明了所提方法的效率和可扩展性。",
