Likewise, the expected signature provides a statistical description of the law of stochastic processes. We propose a feature extraction model for time series built upon the expected signature. This is computed through a Gaussian processes based data augmentation. One of the main features is that an optimal feature extraction is learnt through the supervised task that uses the model.",
