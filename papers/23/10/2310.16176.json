In this paper, we introduce a simple yet efficient technique, CoBa, to reduce hallucination in abstractive summarization. The approach is based on two steps: hallucination detection and mitigation. We show that the former can be achieved through measuring simple statistics about conditional word probabilities and distance to context words.

    "translated_abstract": "摘要生成旨在生成源文件的自然语言摘要，既简洁又保留重要元素。尽管最近取得了一些进展，但神经文本摘要模型容易产生幻觉（或更准确地说是混淆），即生成的摘要包含源文件中没有根据的细节。在本文中，我们引入了一种简单而有效的技术，CoBa，用于减少摘要中的幻觉。该方法基于两个步骤：幻觉检测和减轻。我们展示了通过测量有关条件词概率和上下文词距离的简单统计信息可以实现前者。此外，我们还证明了直观的回溯法在减轻幻觉方面的惊人效果。我们在三个文本摘要基准数据集上对所提出的方法进行了全面评估。结果表明，CoBa在减少摘要幻觉方面是有效且高效的。",
