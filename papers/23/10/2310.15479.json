    "abstract": "Diffusion model has become a main paradigm for synthetic data generation in many subfields of modern machine learning, including computer vision, language model, or speech synthesis. In this paper, we leverage the power of diffusion model for generating synthetic tabular data. The heterogeneous features in tabular data have been main obstacles in tabular data synthesis, and we tackle this problem by employing the auto-encoder architecture. When compared with the state-of-the-art tabular synthesizers, the resulting synthetic tables from our model show nice statistical fidelities to the real data, and perform well in downstream tasks for machine learning utilities. We conducted the experiments over 15 publicly available datasets. Notably, our model adeptly captures the correlations among features, which has been a long-standing challenge in tabular data synthesis.

    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型已成为现代机器学习许多子领域中合成数据生成的主要范式，包括计算机视觉、语言模型或语音合成。在本文中，我们利用扩散模型的力量来生成合成的表格数据。表格数据中的异构特征一直是表格数据合成的主要障碍，我们通过使用自动编码器的架构来解决这个问题。与最先进的表格合成器相比，我们模型生成的合成表格在统计上与真实数据非常相似，并在机器学习工具的下游任务中表现良好。我们在15个公开可用的数据集上进行了实验。值得注意的是，我们的模型灵活地捕捉了特征之间的相关性，这是表格数据合成中长期存在的挑战。如若接纳了论文，我们的代码将根据要求提供，并且将公开发布。",
