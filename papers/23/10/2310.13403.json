    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习的日益重要，训练数据的隐私和安全性变得至关重要。联邦学习通过将数据存储在分布式节点中，并仅共享模型参数，来应对这一问题，并因此受到了广泛关注。然而，在联邦学习中存在一种挑战，即拜占庭攻击问题，恶意的本地模型可能在聚合过程中影响全局模型的性能。本文提出了一种基于区块链的拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习（BRLF）模型，将联邦学习与区块链技术相结合。这种集成可以追溯恶意模型，并为本地训练的客户提供激励。我们的方法根据皮尔逊相关系数选择聚合节点，并使用谱聚类计算每个聚类中的平均梯度，并利用聚合节点的本地数据集对其准确性进行验证。实验结果表明，我们的模型在不同的数据集上表现出较高的性能。",
