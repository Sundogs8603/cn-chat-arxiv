    "translated_abstract": "神经模块网络（NMN）是一种有吸引力的视觉问答方法，可以将问题翻译为由一系列推理子任务组成的程序，这些子任务按顺序在图像上执行以产生答案。与集成模型相比，NMN提供了更强的解释性，可以更好地理解底层推理过程。为了提高NMN的效果，我们提出利用大规模跨模态编码器获得的特征。此外，目前的NMN训练方法依赖于将模块输出传播到后续模块，导致预测误差累积和误生成答案。为了缓解这个问题，我们引入了一种NMN学习策略，涉及计划的教师引导。最初，模型完全由地面真实的中间输出引导，但随着训练的进行逐渐过渡到自主行为。这减少了误差积累，从而改善了性能。",
