    "abstract": "Human action recognition from skeletal data is an important and active area of research in which the state of the art has not yet achieved near-perfect accuracy on many well-known datasets. In this paper, we introduce the Distribution of Action Movements Descriptor, a novel action descriptor based on the distribution of the directions of the motions of the joints between frames, over the set of all possible motions in the dataset. The descriptor is computed as a normalized histogram over a set of representative directions of the joints, which are in turn obtained via clustering. While the descriptor is global in the sense that it represents the overall distribution of movement directions of an action, it is able to partially retain its temporal structure by applying a windowing scheme.  The descriptor, together with a standard classifier, outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques on many well-known datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "从骨骼数据中进行人类动作识别是一个重要且活跃的研究领域，在许多著名数据集上，目前的最新技术仍未能达到近乎完美的准确性。本文介绍了一种新颖的动作描述器，即动作运动的分布描述器（DAM），它基于关节在帧之间运动的方向分布，通过计算在数据集中所有可能运动的方向集合上的归一化直方图来表示。该描述器通过聚类获得一组代表性的关节运动方向，并通过应用窗口方案部分保留其时间结构。与标准分类器相结合，该描述器在许多著名数据集上的表现超过了几种最新技术。",
