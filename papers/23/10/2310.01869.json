    "abstract": "Following the EU's decision to ban neonicotinoids, this article investigates the impacts of yellow virus on sugar beet yields under the ban and under current and future climates. Using a model that factors in key variables such as sowing dates, phenological stages, first aphid flight and aphid abundance, simulations are performed using long-period climate datasets as inputs. Coupled with incidence and sugar yield loss assumptions, this model allows to reconstruct the impact of yellow virus on sugar beet yields using a so called 'as if' approach. By simulating the effects of viruses over a longer period of time, as if neonicotinoids weren't used in the past, this methodology allows an accurate assessment of risks associated with yellow viruses, as well as impact of future agroecological mesures. The study eventually provides an actuarial rating for an insurance policy that compensates the losses triggered by those viruses.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了欧盟禁止新烟碱类农药后，黄病毒对甜菜产量的影响以及在当前和未来气候条件下的模拟。使用考虑到播种日期、生物学期、第一次蚜虫迁飞和蚜虫数量等关键变量的模型，使用长期气候数据集进行模拟。结合发病率和糖产量损失的假设，这种模型可以通过所谓的“假设”方法重建黄病毒对甜菜产量的影响。通过模拟病毒在较长时期内的效果，仿佛过去没有使用新烟碱类农药，该方法可以准确评估与黄病毒相关的风险以及未来农业生态措施的影响。最后，研究为一项赔偿因病毒引起的损失的保险方案提供了精算评级。",
