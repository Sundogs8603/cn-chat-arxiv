    "translated_abstract": "开放式常识推理被定义为在不提供1）答案候选名单和2）预定义答案范围的情况下解决常识问题。将常识问题转化为问答形式或利用外部知识学习检索方法的常规方法在开放式环境中不太适用，因为这涉及到一个固有的挑战。在没有预定义答案范围或少数候选者的情况下，开放式常识推理需要通过在极大的搜索空间中搜索来预测答案。此外，大多数问题需要隐含的多跳推理，这给我们的问题带来了更多挑战。在这项工作中，我们利用预训练的语言模型在外部知识库上迭代地检索推理路径，这不需要特定任务的监督。推理路径可以帮助我们找到最准确的常识问题答案。我们在两个常识基准数据集上进行实验。",

The authors propose using pre-trained language models to iteratively retrieve reasoning paths on an external knowledge base, which helps to find the most precise answers. Experimental results show that this approach achieves good performance on commonsense questions."
