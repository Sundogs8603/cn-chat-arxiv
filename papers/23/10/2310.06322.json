    "translated_abstract": "冻结步态是帕金森病的症状之一，患者在行走时会周期性地出现不能迈步或转身的情况。虽然医学专家已经发现了多种引发和缓解冻结步态的方法，但其潜在原因和预测模型仍在研究中。目前利用机器学习的冻结步态预测模型可基于时间序列数据实现高敏感性和特异性，但这些模型缺乏对冻结步态事件类型的具体说明。我们开发了各种使用转换器编码器架构加上双向LSTM层和不同特征集的深度学习模型，以预测三种不同类型的冻结步态事件。最佳模型在测试数据上获得了0.427的得分，在由迈克尔·J·福克斯基金会主办的Kaggle冻结步态预测竞赛中排名前五。然而，我们也意识到了过拟合的问题",
