    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）正在成为机器学习作为服务的主要推动力，其中客户（客户端）在服务提供商（服务器）的协调下共同从共享的本地更新中受益。考虑到数据异质性的负面效应，研究人员分别调查了客户的当前需求和服务器的未来需求，即本地模型个性化和全局模型泛化，而不是一个取代另一个。然而，这两个看似竞争的目标都同样重要，而不是黑白问题，应该同时实现。在本文中，我们提出了基于博弈论的第一个平衡个性化和泛化的算法，称为PAGE。为了探索均衡，PAGE将博弈进一步形式化为马尔科夫决策过程，并利用强化学习算法简化了解决方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a federated learning algorithm called PAGE, which balances personalization and generalization using game theory. It treats federated learning as a cooperative competition game between clients and the server, and utilizes Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning to find the equilibrium."
