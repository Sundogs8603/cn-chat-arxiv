    "abstract": "This paper provides statistical sample complexity bounds for score-matching and its applications in causal discovery. We demonstrate that accurate estimation of the score function is achievable by training a standard deep ReLU neural network using stochastic gradient descent. We establish bounds on the error rate of recovering causal relationships using the score-matching-based causal discovery method of Rolland et al. [2022], assuming a sufficiently good estimation of the score function. Finally, we analyze the upper bound of score-matching estimation within the score-based generative modeling, which has been applied for causal discovery but is also of independent interest within the domain of generative models.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提供了score-matching及其在因果发现中的应用的统计样本复杂度界限。我们证明通过使用随机梯度下降训练标准的深度ReLU神经网络可以实现对分数函数的准确估计。在假定分数函数的估计足够好的情况下，我们对使用基于score-matching的因果发现方法的恢复因果关系的错误率建立了界限。最后，我们分析了基于分数的生成建模中的score-matching估计的上界，该方法不仅在因果发现中应用广泛，也在生成模型领域具有独立的研究意义。",
