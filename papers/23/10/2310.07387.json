    "abstract": "Linguistic laws, the common statistical patterns of human language, have been investigated by quantitative linguists for nearly a century. Recently, biologists from a range of disciplines have started to explore the prevalence of these laws beyond language, finding patterns consistent with linguistic laws across multiple levels of biological organisation, from molecular (genomes, genes, and proteins) to organismal (animal behaviour) to ecological (populations and ecosystems). We propose a new conceptual framework for the study of linguistic laws in biology, comprising and integrating distinct levels of analysis, from description to prediction to theory building. Adopting this framework will provide critical new insights into the fundamental rules of organisation underpinning natural systems, unifying linguistic laws and core theory in biology.",

    "translated_abstract": "近一个世纪以来，定量语言学家一直在研究人类语言的常见统计模式，称为语言学定律。最近，来自不同学科的生物学家开始探索这些定律在语言之外的普遍性，发现与语言学定律一致的模式存在于生物组织的多个层次，从分子（基因组、基因和蛋白质）到个体（动物行为）到生态（种群和生态系统）。我们提出了一个新的概念框架，用于研究生物学中的语言学定律，包括和整合不同的分析层次，从描述到预测到理论建立。采用这个框架将为揭示自然系统基本组织规律提供关键的新见解，将语言学定律和生物学的核心理论统一起来。",
