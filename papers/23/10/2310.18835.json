By applying the experience-weighted attraction model, the study reveals that the set of possible long-term action patterns can vary significantly based on the behavioral parameters, ranging from a unique risk-dominant option to outcomes richer than the collection of Nash equilibria. The research also explores the role of influential agents in shaping the actions of the entire network."
