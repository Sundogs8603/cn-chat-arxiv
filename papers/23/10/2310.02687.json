    "translated_abstract": "最近神经辐射场（NeRF）因其出色的能力来表示3D场景和合成新的视角图像而受到广泛关注。现有的工作通常假设输入图像是由全局快门相机拍摄的。因此，滚动快门（RS）图像不能直接应用于现成的NeRF算法进行新视角合成。滚动快门效应还会影响相机位姿估计（例如通过COLMAP），进一步阻碍了使用RS图像的NeRF算法的成功。本文提出了一种解卷曲快门束调整的神经辐射场（USB-NeRF）。USB-NeRF能够在NeRF框架下纠正滚动快门失真并同时恢复准确的相机运动轨迹，通过对RS相机的物理图像形成过程进行建模。实验结果表明，USB-NeRF相比之前的工作在RS效应去除和新视角图像生成方面取得了更好的性能。",
