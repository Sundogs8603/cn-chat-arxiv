    "translated_abstract": "近年来，大规模在线开放课程（MOOCs）作为一种快速增长的在线学习现象获得了显著的关注。与传统的教室不同，MOOCs提供了一个独特的机会，以满足来自不同背景和地理位置的各种受众。著名大学和专门提供MOOCs的供应商，如Coursera，在各种主题上提供MOOC课程。由于高入学率和教师与学习者之间的有限直接互动，自动评估任务如成绩和早期退学预测变得必要。然而，当前自动评估方法忽视了下游任务中涉及不同实体之间的结构链接，例如学生和课程。我们的假设是，通过交互图表现的这些结构关系包含可以提高所需任务性能的宝贵信息。为了验证这一点，我们为一个大规模MOOC构建了一个独特的知识图谱。",
