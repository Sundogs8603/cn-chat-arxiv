    "abstract": "Enhanced efforts in the transportation sector should be implemented to mitigate the adverse effects of CO2 emissions resulting from zoning-based planning paradigms. The innovative concept of the 15-minute city, with a focus on proximity-based planning, holds promise in minimizing unnecessary travel and advancing the progress toward achieving carbon neutrality. However, an important research question that remains insufficiently explored is: to what extent is a 15-minute city concept within reach for US cities? This paper establishes a comprehensive framework to evaluate the 15-minute city concept using SafeGraph Point of Interest (POI) check-in data in the 12 most populous US cities. The results reveal that residents are more likely to rely on cars due to the fact that most of their essential activities are located beyond convenient walking, cycling, and public transit distances. However, there is significant potential for the implementation of the 15-minute city concept, as most reside",
