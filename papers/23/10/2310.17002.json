    "abstract": "Predictive models in ML need to be trustworthy and reliable, which often at the very least means outputting calibrated probabilities. This can be particularly difficult to guarantee in the online prediction setting when the outcome sequence can be generated adversarially. In this paper we introduce a technique using Blackwell's approachability theorem for taking an online predictive model which might not be calibrated and transforming its predictions to calibrated predictions without much increase to the loss of the original model. Our proposed algorithm achieves calibration and accuracy at a faster rate than existing techniques arXiv:1607.03594 and is the first algorithm to offer a flexible tradeoff between calibration error and accuracy in the online setting. We demonstrate this by characterizing the space of jointly achievable calibration and regret using our technique.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习中的预测模型需要具有可信和可靠的特性，这通常至少意味着输出校准的概率。在线预测设置中，当结果序列可以由对手对抗地生成时，保证校准性可能特别困难。本文介绍了一种使用布莱克韦尔可接近性定理的技术，将可能不校准的在线预测模型的预测转化为校准的预测，而原模型的损失不会大幅增加。我们提出的算法在在线设置中以更快的速度实现了校准和准确性，相比已有的技术(arXiv:1607.03594)，我们的算法是第一个在在线设置中提供校准误差和准确性之间灵活权衡的算法。通过使用我们的技术，我们能够描述出可共同实现的校准和遗憾的空间。",
