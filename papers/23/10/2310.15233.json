    "translated_abstract": "引力波事件的搜索使用信号模型或模板。目前在LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK)数据中使用的模板仅模拟了信号的主导四极模式$(\\ell,m)=(2,2)$，忽略了次要的高阶模式(HM)例如$(\\ell,m)=(3,3)$，$(4,4)$，这些模式是由广义相对论预测的。因此，这些搜索可能会在参数空间的一些有趣区域，如高质量和非对称质量比的系统中失去对黑洞合并的灵敏度。我们开发了一种新策略，将HM包含在模板库中，利用这些模式之间的自然关联。我们使用了牛顿附加公式和机器学习工具来模拟与给定$(2,2)$波形相对应的自旋对齐的$(3,3)$，$(4,4)$波形。可以对每个模式的数据进行单独滤波，得到信噪比(SNR)的独立时间序列，然后可以以相对廉价的方式将其组合起来进行综合。",
