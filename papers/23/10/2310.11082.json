    "translated_abstract": "合成致死（SL）预测是用于识别两个基因的共突变是否导致细胞死亡的方法。目前的策略是将SL预测抽象为在SL数据中的基因节点上的边分类任务，并通过图神经网络（GNNs）实现。然而，GNNs存在消息传递机制的限制，包括过度平滑和过度压缩问题。此外，利用大规模多组学数据中的非SL基因关系信息来促进SL预测面临着一个非常具有挑战性的问题。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的基于多组学采样的图转换器用于SL预测（MSGT-SL）。具体而言，我们引入了一个浅层多视图GNN来从SL和多组学数据中获取局部结构模式。此外，我们将编码多视图信息的基因特征输入到标准的自注意力机制中，以捕捉长程依赖关系。值得注意的是，我们从SL数据中的批量基因开始，采用并行化的方法。",
