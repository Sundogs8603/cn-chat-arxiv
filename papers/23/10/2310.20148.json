    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles need to accomplish their tasks while interacting with human drivers in traffic. It is thus crucial to equip autonomous vehicles with artificial reasoning to better comprehend the intentions of the surrounding traffic, thereby facilitating the accomplishments of the tasks. In this work, we propose a behavioral model that encodes drivers' interacting intentions into latent social-psychological parameters. Leveraging a Bayesian filter, we develop a receding-horizon optimization-based controller for autonomous vehicle decision-making which accounts for the uncertainties in the interacting drivers' intentions. For online deployment, we design a neural network architecture based on the attention mechanism which imitates the behavioral model with online estimated parameter priors. We also propose a decision tree search algorithm to solve the decision-making problem online. The proposed behavioral model is then evaluated in terms of its capabilities for real-world trajector",

    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶车辆需要在交通中与人类驾驶员互动来完成任务。因此，为了更好地理解周围交通的意图以促进任务的完成，将自动驾驶车辆配备人工推理是至关重要的。本文提出了一个行为模型，将驾驶员的互动意图编码为潜在的社交心理参数。利用贝叶斯滤波器，我们开发了一个基于优化的滚动地平面控制器，用于自动驾驶车辆的决策制定，考虑了交互驾驶员意图的不确定性。为了实现在线部署，我们设计了一个基于注意机制的神经网络架构，以在线估计参数先验来模仿行为模型。我们还提出了一个决策树搜索算法来解决在线决策问题。然后，我们评估了所提出的行为模型在实际轨迹方面的能力。",
