In addition to homogeneity and full heterogeneity, our specification can also capture sparse heterogeneity, that is, there is a core group of units that share common parameters and a set of deviators with idiosyncratic parameters.

We find evidence for sparse heterogeneity for balanced panels composed of individuals with long employment histories.",
