    "abstract": "We study continual event extraction, which aims to extract incessantly emerging event information while avoiding forgetting. We observe that the semantic confusion on event types stems from the annotations of the same text being updated over time. The imbalance between event types even aggravates this issue. This paper proposes a novel continual event extraction model with semantic confusion rectification. We mark pseudo labels for each sentence to alleviate semantic confusion. We transfer pivotal knowledge between current and previous models to enhance the understanding of event types. Moreover, we encourage the model to focus on the semantics of long-tailed event types by leveraging other associated types. Experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is proficient in imbalanced datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了持续事件提取，旨在提取不断出现的事件信息同时避免遗忘。我们观察到，事件类型的语义混淆源于同一文本的注释随时间更新。事件类型之间的不平衡甚至加剧了这个问题。本文提出了一种新颖的带有语义混淆修正的持续事件提取模型。我们为每个句子标注伪标签以缓解语义混淆。我们在当前模型和之前模型之间传递关键知识，以增强对事件类型的理解。此外，我们通过利用其他相关类型来鼓励模型关注长尾事件类型的语义。实验结果表明，我们的模型优于最先进的基线模型，并且在不平衡的数据集上表现出良好的性能。",
