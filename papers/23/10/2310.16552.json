    "translated_abstract": "聚类是一种通过发现数据组之间的群集来提取知识的数据分析方法。在这些方法中，最先进的基于密度的聚类方法已被证明对任意形状的群集非常有效。尽管结果令人鼓舞，但它们难以找到低密度群集，与相似密度的群集，以及高维数据。我们的提议是一种新的群集特征描述和基于空间密度和概率方法的聚类算法。首先，通过使用点之间的成对距离的概率密度函数（$p.d.f$）表示空间密度，构建子群集。然后提出了一种方法来通过使用子群集的密度（$p.d.f$）和空间距离来聚合相似的子群集。我们提出的关键想法是使用Wasserstein距离度量子群集的$p.d.f$之间的距离，这是一种衡量距离的强大工具。我们展示了我们的方法优于其他最先进的基于密度的聚类方法。",
