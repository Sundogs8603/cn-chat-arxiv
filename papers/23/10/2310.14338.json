    "translated_abstract": "随着社交媒体的兴起，用户接触到许多误导性的声明。然而，这些帖子中固有的混杂噪声使得辨别需要验证的精确且显著的声明变得很具挑战性。从这些帖子中提取重要的声明是费时且困难的，然而这是一个未被充分探索的问题。在这里，我们旨在填补这个差距。我们引入了一个新颖的任务，称为声明标准化（ClaimNorm），旨在将复杂而嘈杂的社交媒体帖子分解为更直接和易于理解的形式，称为标准化声明。我们提出了CACN，一种开创性的方法，利用思维链和声明值得检查的估计来模拟人类推理过程，以理解复杂的声明。此外，我们利用大型语言模型的上下文学习能力来提供指导并改进声明标准化。为了评估我们所提出的模型的有效性，我们精心编制了一个全面的真实世界数据集。",
