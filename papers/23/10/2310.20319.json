    "translated_abstract": "广泛使用的基于LiDAR的3D物体检测器在进行置信度估计时往往忽略了从物体提议中获得的基本几何信息。这主要是由于架构设计选择，往往采用了从2D图像领域采纳的方法，而在2D图像领域中几何上下文很少可用。然而，在3D中，综合考虑物体属性及其周围环境对于区分真正的和错误的检测结果，例如一组遮挡的行人，是很重要的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了GACE，一种直观且高效的方法来改进给定黑盒3D物体检测器的置信度估计。我们聚合检测结果的几何线索和它们之间的空间关系，从而能够准确评估它们的可行性，并因此改进置信度估计。这样就实现了在多种最先进的检测器上持续的性能提升。在所有评估的检测器中，GACE被证明特别有效。",
