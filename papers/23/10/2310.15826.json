    "translated_abstract": "我们周围的世界不断变化。这些变化经常被描述为概念漂移，影响着许多工业和技术过程。由于它们可能导致故障和其他异常行为，在许多场景中可能具有安全风险，因此检测和分析概念漂移至关重要。本文提供了一份关于非监督数据流中概念漂移的文献综述。虽然许多调查重点关注监督数据流，但迄今为止还没有针对非监督环境的工作进行综述。然而，这种设置对于监测和异常检测特别重要，这些技术直接适用于工程中的许多任务和挑战。本调查提供了现有漂移检测工作的分类法，并以系统的方式涵盖了漂移定位研究的最新状态。除了提供系统的文献综述外，本文还提供了对所涉问题的精确定义，并介绍了相关的数学定义。",
