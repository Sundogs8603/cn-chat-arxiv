    "translated_abstract": "过去几十年中，网络攻击的数量不断增长，给经济和隐私造成严重损害，这揭示了网络入侵检测方法在预防网络攻击和降低风险方面的需求。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新的网络表示形式，即流图，旨在为入侵检测任务提供相关的拓扑信息，如恶意行为模式、多步攻击阶段之间的关系以及欺骗和预欺骗攻击者活动之间的关系。此外，我们提出了一个基于图神经网络（GNN）的框架，用于利用所提出的图结构对通信流进行分类，并为其分配恶意程度得分。该框架包括三个主要步骤，旨在嵌入节点特征并从网络表示中学习相关的攻击模式。最后，我们强调了传统评估过程中可能存在的数据泄漏问题，并提出了建议。",
