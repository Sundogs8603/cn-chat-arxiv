    "translated_abstract": "电子商务应用（如面向属性的产品搜索或产品比较）基于结构化的产品描述，如属性/值对。电子商务平台上的供应商不提供结构化的产品描述，而是使用标题或描述来描述产品。为了处理这样的产品，有必要从文本产品属性中提取属性/值对。现有技术中，属性/值提取方法依赖于预训练的语言模型（如BERT）。这些模型在属性/值提取方面存在两个主要缺点：（一）模型需要大量的与任务相关的训练数据；（二）优化后的模型在推广到训练数据中未包含的属性值方面面临挑战。本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为训练数据效率高且鲁棒性强的替代方法在属性/值提取中的潜力。我们考虑了托管的LLMs，如GPT-3.5和GPT-4。",
