    "translated_abstract": "利率期限结构（收益率曲线）是金融分析中的重要组成部分，影响各种投资和风险管理决策。它被中央银行用于实施和监控货币政策。该工具反映了投资者对通胀预期和风险的看法。收益率曲线上报的利率是所有资产估值的基石。为了为布隆迪的金融市场提供这样的工具，我们从布隆迪央行的网站收集了国库证券的拍卖报告。然后，我们计算了零息票利率，并应用Nelson-Siegel和Svensson模型估计了保险精算利率。本文对这两个主要参数化收益率曲线模型进行了严格的比较分析，并发现Nelson-Siegel模型是建模布隆迪收益率曲线的最佳选择。这些研究结果对于收益率曲线建模的知识体系有所贡献，提升了其精确性和适用性。",
