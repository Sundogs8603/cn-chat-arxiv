    "abstract": "This report focuses on enhancing a binary code comment quality classification model by integrating generated code and comment pairs, to improve model accuracy. The dataset comprises 9048 pairs of code and comments written in the C programming language, each annotated as \"Useful\" or \"Not Useful.\" Additionally, code and comment pairs are generated using a Large Language Model Architecture, and these generated pairs are labeled to indicate their utility. The outcome of this effort consists of two classification models: one utilizing the original dataset and another incorporating the augmented dataset with the newly generated code comment pairs and labels.",
