    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes the use of conditional unscented autoencoders (CVAE) for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving. By leveraging advances in the field of variational autoencoders (VAE) and introducing improvements such as nonlinear sampling, a more structured latent space, and a novel inference method, the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and provides better performance in trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles."
