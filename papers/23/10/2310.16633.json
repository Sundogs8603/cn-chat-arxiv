    "abstract": "In this paper we propose to apply copula entropy (CE) to photometric redshifts. CE is used to measure the correlations between photometric measurements and redshifts and then the measurements associated with high CEs are selected for predicting redshifts. We verified the proposed method on the SDSS quasar data. Experimental results show that the accuracy of photometric redshifts is improved with the selected measurements compared to the results with all the measurements used in the experiments, especially for the samples with high redshifts. The measurements selected with CE include luminosity magnitude, the brightness in ultraviolet band with standard deviation, and the brightness of the other four bands. Since CE is a rigorously defined mathematical concept, the models such derived is interpretable.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出将Copula熵（CE）应用于光度红移研究。CE用于测量光度测量和红移之间的相关性，并选择与高CE相关的测量来预测红移。我们在SDSS类星体数据上验证了提出的方法。实验结果显示，与实验中使用了所有测量结果相比，选择使用CE的测量结果显著提高了光度红移的准确性，特别是对于高红移样本。使用CE选择的测量结果包括亮度大小，紫外波段亮度的标准差以及其他四个波段的亮度。由于CE是一个严格定义的数学概念，因此所得到的模型是可解释的。",
