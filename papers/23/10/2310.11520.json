    "abstract": "Natural Language Processing is booming with its applications in the real world, one of which is Text Summarization for large texts including news articles. This research paper provides an extensive comparative evaluation of extractive and abstractive approaches for news text summarization, with an emphasis on the ROUGE score analysis. The study employs the CNN-Daily Mail dataset, which consists of news articles and human-generated reference summaries. The evaluation employs ROUGE scores to assess the efficacy and quality of generated summaries. After Evaluation, we integrate the best-performing models on a web application to assess their real-world capabilities and user experience.",
