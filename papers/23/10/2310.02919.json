    "translated_abstract": "人类遗传疾病通常由点突变引起，这凸显了对精确基因组编辑技术的关键需求。其中，碱基编辑以其能够在单个核苷酸水平上进行定向改变而脱颖而出。然而，其临床应用受到编辑效率低和非预期突变的限制，需要在实验室进行大量的试错实验。为了加速这个过程，我们提出了一个基于注意力的两阶段机器学习模型，该模型学习预测给定基因组目标序列的所有可能编辑结果的可能性。我们进一步提出了一个多任务学习模式，同时学习多种碱基编辑器（即变体）。我们模型的预测结果在多个数据集和碱基编辑器变体上始终表现出与实际实验结果的强相关性。这些结果进一步验证了模型改进和加速基因编辑设计过程能力。",
