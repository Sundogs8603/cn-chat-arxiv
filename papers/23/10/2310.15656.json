    "translated_abstract": "由于其出色的高阶表示能力，超图神经网络（HGNNs）已成功应用于各种超图相关任务。最近的研究表明，深度学习模型容易受到对抗攻击。大多数关于图对抗攻击的研究都集中在图神经网络（GNNs）上，对HGNNs的对抗攻击研究仍然相对较少。本文试图填补这一空白。我们设计了一个新的HGNNs攻击模型，用于非目标攻击，即MGHGA，重点是修改节点特征。我们考虑HGNNs训练过程，并使用替代模型在超图建模之前实施攻击。具体而言，MGHGA包括两部分：特征选择和特征修改。我们在特征选择模块中使用动量梯度机制选择攻击节点特征。在特征修改模块中，我们使用两种特征生成方法（直接修改和符号梯度）来进行修改。",
