    "translated_abstract": "在机器人技术和人工智能领域，触觉处理的整合变得越来越重要，特别是在学习执行像对准和插入这样复杂任务时。然而，现有研究主要依赖机器人遥操作数据和强化学习，忽视了人类受触觉反馈引导下的控制策略所提供的丰富见解。为了利用人类感觉，现有的从人类学习的方法主要利用视觉反馈，常常忽视了人类本能地利用触觉反馈完成复杂操作的宝贵经验。为了填补这一空白，我们引入了一种新框架\"MimicTouch\"，模仿人类的触觉引导控制策略。在这个框架中，我们首先从人类示范者那里收集多模态触觉数据集，包括人类触觉引导的控制策略来完成任务。接下来的步骤涉及指令的传递，其中机器人通过模仿人类的触觉引导策略来执行任务。",
