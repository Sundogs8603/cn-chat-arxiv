    "translated_abstract": "由于对新兴疾病的信息有限，症状很难被察觉和认识到，因此可能忽视临床干预的窗口。期望能够建立一个有效的预后模型，辅助医生进行正确诊断和制定个性化治疗方案，从而及时预防不利结果。然而，在疾病早期阶段，由于数据收集和临床经验有限，再加上对隐私和伦理的考虑，导致可供参考的数据受限，甚至难以正确标记数据标签。此外，不同疾病或同一疾病不同来源的电子医疗记录（EMR）数据可能存在严重的跨数据集特征不匹配问题，严重影响深度学习模型的效率。本文介绍了一种迁移学习方法，建立一个从源数据集到目标数据集的过渡模型，通过对特征进行约束，来解决数据分布变化的问题。",
