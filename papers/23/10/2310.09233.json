    "translated_abstract": "近年来，利用具有出色决策能力的LLM（语言混合模型）代理作为可信的人类代理出现了。然而，现有研究主要集中在模拟人类对话上。人类的非语言行为，如推荐系统中的物品点击，虽然隐含着用户的偏好并能提升用户建模，但尚未得到深入探索。主要原因在于语言建模与行为建模之间的差距，以及LLMs对用户-物品关系的不理解。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了AgentCF，通过基于代理的协同过滤来模拟推荐系统中的用户-物品交互。我们创造性地考虑用户和物品作为代理，并开发了一种协作学习方法来优化这两种代理。具体而言，每个时间步，我们首先促使用户代理和物品代理自主地进行交互。然后，基于差异性对这两类代理进行优化。",
