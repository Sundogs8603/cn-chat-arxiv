    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于深度神经网络（DNN）的代理模型广泛应用于解决传统上通过数值模拟处理的偏微分方程。然而，这种代理模型着重于对训练数据集的全局插值，因此需要较大的网络结构。这个过程耗时且计算成本高，限制了其在复杂物理问题的高保真预测中的应用。本研究开发了一种具有局部收敛输入的神经网络（NNLCI），用于使用非结构化数据进行高保真预测。该框架利用局部依赖域和收敛的粗略解作为输入，大大降低了计算资源和训练时间。作为验证案例，NNLCI方法被应用于研究具有凸块的导流道中的无粘超音速流。考虑了不同的凸块几何形状和位置，用于评估其有效性和多功能性。",
