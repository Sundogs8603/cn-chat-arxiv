    "translated_abstract": "在现有的拼接伪造数据集中，拼接区域的语义变化不足导致训练的检测模型对语义特征的过拟合。同时，由于缺乏合理的数据集，不同的检测方法在实验设置上无法达成一致。为了解决这些紧迫的问题，本文提出了GreatSplicing，一个手动创建的具有大量和高质量的拼接数据集。GreatSplicing包括5000张拼接图像，并涵盖了335个不同的语义类别的拼接区域，让神经网络更好地抓住拼接痕迹。大量实验证明，使用GreatSplicing训练的模型相较于现有数据集表现出较低的误识率和更好的跨数据集检测能力。此外，GreatSplicing可供所有研究目的使用，并可从www.greatsplicing.net下载。",
