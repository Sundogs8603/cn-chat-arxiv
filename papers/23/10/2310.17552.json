    "translated_abstract": "机器人学习方法近年来取得了巨大的进展，但是泛化和鲁棒性的挑战仍然制约着它们的广泛应用。无法检测和解决潜在故障使得最先进的学习系统无法在高风险任务中投入使用。最近在交互式模仿学习方面的进展提出了一个有希望的框架，可以实现人机团队合作，使机器人能够安全操作并在长期部署中不断提高性能。然而，现有方法通常需要持续的人工监督和预先的反馈，限制了它们在实际领域的实用性。本文旨在赋予机器人在任务执行过程中监控和检测错误的能力。我们引入了一种基于模型的运行时监控算法，通过学习部署数据来检测系统异常并预测故障。与以前的工作不同，我们的方法能够预见未来的故障，而且不需要故障经验来进行训练。",
