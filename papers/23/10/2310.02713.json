    "translated_abstract": "单细胞RNA测序(scRNA-seq)在揭示复杂组织中微妙的细胞多样性方面取得了重要进展。这在大脑中尤为关键，因为大脑比其他组织类型有更多种类的细胞，以便更深入地了解不同细胞环境下的大脑功能。然而，由于缺失事件所产生的固有测量噪声以及对大量基因表达信息的有限利用，分析scRNA-seq数据仍然是一个挑战。在这项工作中，我们引入了scHyena，这是一个旨在应对这些挑战并提高大脑中scRNA-seq分析准确性的基础模型。具体而言，受到最近的Hyena算子的启发，我们设计了一种新颖的Transformer架构，称为单细胞Hyena(scHyena)，它配备了线性适配器层、通过基因嵌入实现的位置编码和一个双向Hyena算子。这使我们能够处理全长的scRNA-seq数据而不丢失信息。",
