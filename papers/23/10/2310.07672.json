To stabilize these model explanations, we propose ControlSHAP, an approach based on the Monte Carlo technique of control variates.

    "translated_abstract": "Shapley值是解释黑盒机器学习模型预测最流行的工具之一。然而，它们的计算成本很高，因此采用抽样近似来减少不确定性。为了稳定这些模型解释，我们提出了一种基于控制变量的蒙特卡洛技术的方法，称为ControlSHAP。我们的方法适用于任何机器学习模型，并且几乎不需要额外的计算或建模工作。在多个高维数据集上，我们发现它可以显著减少Shapley估计的蒙特卡洛变异性。",
