    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理威胁、生成有关工具信息和自动化网络攻击中的潜力。我们首先手动探索了LLMs在支持特定威胁相关操作和决策方面的能力。然后，我们将决策过程自动化应用于网络攻击行动中。我们提出了针对威胁行动的计划-行动-报告循环的提示工程方法，以及指导多项行动的连锁提示设计。我们评估了LLM在我们展示的短期攻击中的网络特定知识，并就引发可执行响应的提示设计提供见解。我们讨论了LLMs对威胁格局的潜在影响以及使用LLMs加速威胁行为能力的伦理考虑。我们报告了生成式人工智能在网络威胁中的一种有希望但令人担忧的应用。然而，LLM解决更复杂和持续性威胁的能力还有待探讨。",
