In this work, we justify the use of graph neural networks for these problems, based on the similarity between these architectures and the meshes used in traditional numerical techniques for solving partial differential equations.

    "translated_abstract": "自从[9]的开创性工作以及他们的物理信息神经网络（PINNs）之后，已经有很多工作致力于使用深度学习模型来解决偏微分方程（PDEs）。然而，仍然存在一些挑战，例如将这些模型扩展到复杂的三维几何体，以及如何将这些方法与经典的数值求解器结合起来进行研究。在本工作中，我们基于图神经网络和传统数值技术中用于求解偏微分方程的网格之间的相似性，证明了将图神经网络用于这些问题的合理性。在证明了物理信息框架在复杂几何体上计算PDE残差时存在问题后，我们提出了一种替代方案，将经典的数值求解器与物理信息框架相结合。最后，我们提出了一种实现该方法的方案，并在一个不规则几何体上的三维问题上进行了测试。",
