    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种新的基于学习的方法，用于编码和操作3D表面网格。我们的方法专门设计用来创建一个可解释的嵌入空间，用于处理可变形的形状集合。与之前的3D网格自编码器不同，我们的方法在无监督的条件下对多样化的网格进行训练。我们的方法的核心是一种谱池化技术，它建立了一个通用的潜空间，打破了传统网格连通性和形状类别的约束。整个过程分为两个阶段。在第一个阶段，我们使用函数映射范式以无监督的方式提取一组形状之间的点对点映射。然后利用这些点对点映射构建一个共同的潜空间，从而确保了直观解释和独立于网格连通性和形状类别。通过大量实验证明，我们的方法取得了优秀的结果。",
