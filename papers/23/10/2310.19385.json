The proposed approach leverage neural emulators to train an approximation of the reduced state-space solver, which is then used to allows gradient propagation through temporal integration steps. The algorithm is able to recover most of the benefit of online strategies without having to compute the gradient of the original solver.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种通用算法，用于在线训练基于机器学习的亚网格参数化，并通过后验损失函数适应非可微分数值求解器。所提出的方法利用神经仿真器训练简化状态空间求解器的近似值，然后通过时间积分步骤允许梯度传播。该算法能够在不计算原始求解器梯度的情况下恢复大部分在线策略的好处。实验证明，将神经仿真器和参数化组件分别用相应的损失量进行训练是必要的，以最小化某些近似偏差的传播。",
