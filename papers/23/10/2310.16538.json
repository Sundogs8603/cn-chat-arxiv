    "abstract": "Psychiatrists diagnose mental disorders via the linguistic use of patients. Still, due to data privacy, existing passive mental health monitoring systems use alternative features such as activity, app usage, and location via mobile devices. We propose FedTherapist, a mobile mental health monitoring system that utilizes continuous speech and keyboard input in a privacy-preserving way via federated learning. We explore multiple model designs by comparing their performance and overhead for FedTherapist to overcome the complex nature of on-device language model training on smartphones. We further propose a Context-Aware Language Learning (CALL) methodology to effectively utilize smartphones' large and noisy text for mental health signal sensing. Our IRB-approved evaluation of the prediction of self-reported depression, stress, anxiety, and mood from 46 participants shows higher accuracy of FedTherapist compared with the performance with non-language features, achieving 0.15 AUROC improveme",

    "translated_abstract": "精神科医生通过患者的语言使用来诊断精神疾病。但由于数据隐私问题，现有的被动精神健康监测系统使用手机设备的活动、应用使用和位置等替代特征。我们提出了FedTherapist，一种利用联邦学习以隐私保护方式使用持续语音和键盘输入的移动精神健康监测系统。我们通过比较不同模型设计的性能和开销来克服在智能手机上进行设备内语言模型训练的复杂性。我们还提出了一种上下文感知语言学习（CALL）方法，以有效利用智能手机的大规模和嘈杂文本进行精神健康信号感知。我们在46名参与者中进行了经IRB批准的自我报告抑郁、压力、焦虑和心情的预测评估，结果显示FedTherapist相比于非语言特征的性能提高了0.15 AUROC。",
