    "abstract": "Feature attribution methods are widely used to explain neural models by determining the influence of individual input features on the models' outputs. We propose a novel feature attribution method, CAFE (Conflict-Aware Feature-wise Explanations), that addresses three limitations of the existing methods: their disregard for the impact of conflicting features, their lack of consideration for the influence of bias terms, and an overly high sensitivity to local variations in the underpinning activation functions. Unlike other methods, CAFE provides safeguards against overestimating the effects of neuron inputs and separately traces positive and negative influences of input features and biases, resulting in enhanced robustness and increased ability to surface feature conflicts. We show experimentally that CAFE is better able to identify conflicting features on synthetic tabular data and exhibits the best overall fidelity on several real-world tabular datasets, while being highly computation",

    "translated_abstract": "特征归因方法被广泛用于解释神经模型，通过确定单个输入特征对模型输出的影响来解释模型。我们提出了一种新颖的特征归因方法，CAFE（冲突感知的特征解释），它解决了现有方法的三个局限性：对冲突特征影响的忽视，对偏差项影响的缺乏考虑，以及对激活函数局部变化过于敏感。与其他方法不同，CAFE提供了防止高估神经元输入影响的保护机制，并单独追踪输入特征和偏差的正向和负向影响，从而增强了稳健性和发现特征冲突的能力。实验证明，CAFE在合成表格数据上能更好地识别冲突特征，并在几个真实世界的表格数据集上展现了最佳的全面可信度，而计算性能也很高。",
