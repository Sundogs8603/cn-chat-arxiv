    "translated_abstract": "交互式搜索可以通过整合用户的交互反馈来提供更好的搜索体验。这可以显著提高搜索准确性，因为它有助于避免无关信息并捕捉用户的搜索意图。现有的最新系统使用强化学习（RL）模型来整合这些交互，但是忽略了句级反馈中的细粒度信息。然而，这种反馈需要进行广泛的RL行动空间探索和大量的标注数据。本研究通过提出一种新的深度Q学习（DQ）方法DQrank来解决这些挑战。DQrank使用自然语言处理中最新技术BERT-based模型来选择关键句子，并基于用户的参与度对项目进行排序，以获得更满意的回应。我们还提出了两种机制来更好地探索最优行动。DQrank还利用DQ中的经验重现机制来存储反馈句子以增强模型性能。",
