    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are currently effective at answering questions that are clearly asked. However, when faced with ambiguous queries they can act unpredictably and produce incorrect outputs. This underscores the need for the development of intelligent agents capable of asking clarification questions to resolve ambiguities effectively. This capability requires complex understanding, state tracking, reasoning and planning over multiple conversational turns. However, directly measuring this can be challenging. In this paper, we offer a surrogate problem which assesses an LLMs's capability to deduce an entity unknown to itself, but revealed to a judge, by asking the judge a series of queries. This \\textit{entity-deducing game} can serve as an evaluation framework to probe the conversational reasoning and planning capabilities of language models. We systematically evaluate various LLMs and discover significant differences in their performance on this task. We find that strong LLMs",

    "translated_abstract": "目前，大型语言模型（LLMs）在回答明确提问时非常有效。然而，当面临含糊不清的查询时，它们可能行为难以预测并产生错误的输出。这凸显了需要开发能够提出澄清问题以有效解决歧义的智能代理的需求。这种能力需要对多个对话轮次进行复杂的理解、状态跟踪、推理和规划。然而，直接测量这种能力可能具有挑战性。在本文中，我们提供了一个替代性问题，通过向法官提出一系列查询，评估了LLMs推断自己不知道但被法官揭示的实体的能力。这个“实体推断游戏”可以作为一个评估框架，用于探究语言模型的对话推理和规划能力。我们系统地评估了各种LLMs，并发现在这个任务上它们的性能存在显著差异。我们发现强大的LLMs...",
