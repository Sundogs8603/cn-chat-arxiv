    "translated_abstract": "恶意软件作者将混淆视为绕过基于静态分析特征的恶意软件检测器的手段。对于安卓系统，多项研究已确认许多反恶意软件产品很容易通过简单的程序转换来规避。与这些研究相反，使用静态分析特征的机器学习检测方法也被提出来对抗混淆。因此，需要确定特定混淆策略或工具的使用对于基于静态分析特征的机器学习恶意软件检测的有效性构成何种风险。为了阐明这一问题，在这篇文章中，我们评估了特定混淆技术对使用静态分析提取的常见特征的影响，并确定这些变化是否足够显著以破坏依赖这些特征的机器学习恶意软件检测器的有效性。实验结果表明，混淆技术对所有静态分析特征都产生不同程度的影响。",
