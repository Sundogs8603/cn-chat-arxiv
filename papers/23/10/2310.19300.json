    "translated_abstract": "最近对动态治疗方案（DTRs）的研究取得了重要进展，提出了强大的优化治疗搜索算法，根据个体具体需求量身定制，并能最大化其预期的临床效益。然而，现有算法在优化治疗下可能会受到样本量不足的困扰，尤其是在涉及长时间决策阶段的慢性疾病中。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的个体化学习方法，重点是估计DTR，并优先考虑观察到的治疗轨迹与最佳治疗方案在决策阶段上的一致性。通过放宽观察到的轨迹必须完全与最佳治疗一致的限制，我们的方法大大提高了基于倒数概率加权方法的样本效率和稳定性。具体而言，所提出的学习方案构建了一个更通用的框架，包括了流行的结果加权学习框架。",
