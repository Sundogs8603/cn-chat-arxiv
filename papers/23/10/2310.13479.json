    "abstract": "Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) - the problem of identifying objects in images through natural language sentences - is a challenging task currently mostly solved through supervised learning. However, while collecting referred annotation masks is a time-consuming process, the few existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot approaches fall significantly short in performance compared to fully-supervised learning ones. To bridge the performance gap without mask annotations, we propose a novel weakly-supervised framework that tackles RIS by decomposing it into three steps: obtaining instance masks for the object mentioned in the referencing instruction (segment), using zero-shot learning to select a potentially correct mask for the given instruction (select), and bootstrapping a model which allows for fixing the mistakes of zero-shot selection (correct). In our experiments, using only the first two steps (zero-shot segment and select) outperforms other zero-shot baselines by as much as 19%,",

    "translated_abstract": "指代图像分割（RIS）是通过自然语言句子在图像中识别对象的一个具有挑战性的任务，目前主要通过监督学习来解决。然而，收集指代标注掩模是一个耗时的过程，现有的弱监督和零样本方法在性能上远远不及完全监督学习的方法。为了填补性能差距，我们提出了一种新的弱监督框架，通过将RIS分解成三个步骤进行处理：获取被提及指令中的对象的实例掩模（分段），使用零样本学习来选择给定指令的潜在正确掩模（选择），并通过引导模型来修正零样本选择的错误（纠正）。在我们的实验中，仅使用前两个步骤（零样本分段和选择）比其他零样本基线提高了多达19%的性能。",
