    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习研究在开发用于全局模型的分布式学习算法以及用于根据每个客户端的本地数据分布进行本地个性化的算法方面取得了进展。然而，不同的联邦学习问题可能需要不同的个性化策略，甚至可能无法为所有客户端定义一种有效的通用个性化策略：根据每个客户端的最优预测器与全局模型的相似程度，可能首选不同的个性化策略。在本文中，我们考虑了学习个性化策略的联邦元学习问题。具体而言，我们考虑了通过本地数据统计给出每个客户端的批量归一化和学习率参数的元网络。通过在联邦学习中学习这些元网络，我们允许整个联邦学习网络合作学习为每个客户端定制个性化策略。实证结果表明，我们提出的FedL2P方法可以在各种联邦学习问题上获得良好的性能。",
