    "translated_abstract": "数据驱动的黑盒模型优化（MBO）问题在许多实际应用场景中出现，其目标是基于静态离线数据集，寻找使黑盒目标函数最大化的整个空间上的设计。在这项工作中，我们考虑了一种更一般但具有挑战性的MBO设置，称为约束MBO（CoMBO），其中只有部分设计空间可以优化，而其余部分受环境约束。CoMBO带来的新挑战是大多数满足约束条件的观察设计在评估中是平庸的。因此，我们的重点是在离线数据集中优化这些平庸的设计，同时保持给定的约束，而不是在传统的MBO设置中进一步增强最佳观察设计。我们提出了检索增强的离线模型优化（ROMO），一种新的可导性前向方法，它检索离线数据集并聚合相关样本以提供可靠的预测，然后将其应用于CoMBO。",
