    "translated_abstract": "大多数现有的神经多目标组合优化（MOCO）问题的方法仅依赖于分解，这往往导致子问题的重复解决方案，从而得到有限的帕累托集。除了分解，我们提出了一种具有多样性增强的神经启发式方法（NHDE），从两个角度产生更多帕累托解。一方面，为了阻止不同子问题的重复解决方案，我们提出了一种指示器增强的深度强化学习方法来指导模型，并设计了一种异构图注意机制来捕捉实例图和帕累托前沿图之间的关系。另一方面，为了在每个子问题的邻域中挖掘更多的解决方案，我们提出了多重帕累托最有策略来采样和保留理想的解决方案。在经典的 MOCO 问题上的实验结果表明，我们的 NHDE 能够生成具有更高多样性的帕累托前沿，从而实现更优越的综合效果",
