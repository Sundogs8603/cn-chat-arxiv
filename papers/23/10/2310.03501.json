    "abstract": "Digital Participatory Budgeting (PB) has become a key democratic tool for resource allocation in cities. Enabled by digital platforms, new voting input formats and aggregation have been utilised. Yet, challenges in achieving fairness and legitimacy persist. This study investigates the trade-offs in various voting and aggregation methods within digital PB. Through behavioural experiments, we identified favourable voting design combinations in terms of cognitive load, proportionality, and perceived legitimacy. The research reveals how design choices profoundly influence collective decision-making, citizen perceptions, and outcome fairness. Our findings offer actionable insights for human-computer interaction, mechanism design, and computational social choice, contributing to the development of fairer and more transparent digital PB systems and multi-winner collective decision-making process for citizens.",

    "translated_abstract": "数字参与式预算（PB）已成为城市资源分配的重要民主工具。在数字平台的支持下，新的投票输入格式和聚合方法已被利用。然而，实现公平和合法性仍然面临挑战。本研究调查了数字PB中各种投票和聚合方法之间的权衡。通过行为实验，我们确定了在认知负荷、比例和感知合法性方面的有利投票设计组合。研究揭示了设计选择如何深刻影响集体决策、市民感知和结果公平性。我们的发现为人机交互、机制设计和计算社会选择提供了可行的见解，为开发更公平和更透明的数字PB系统和市民的多胜者集体决策过程做出贡献。",
