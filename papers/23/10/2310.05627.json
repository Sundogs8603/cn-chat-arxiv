    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT和GPT-4的卓越成就和快速进展展示了它们在量化投资中的巨大潜力。交易员可以有效利用这些LLMs分析财经新闻并准确预测股票回报。然而，将LLMs整合到现有的量化模型中存在两个主要挑战：未充分利用LLMs中嵌入的语义信息以及将LLMs中的潜在信息与现有的量化股票特征对齐的困难。我们提出了一个由两个组件组成的新框架，以克服这些挑战。第一个组件是本地-全球（LG）模型，它引入了三个不同的策略来对全球信息进行建模。这些方法分别基于股票特征、LLMs的能力以及结合两个范式的混合方法。第二个组件是自相关增强学习（SCRL），其重点是对齐两个模型之间的关联关系。",
