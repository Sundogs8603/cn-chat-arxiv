    "translated_abstract": "四维（4D）雷达是一种在各种天气条件下进行三维目标检测和周围物体相对径向速度估计的有用传感器。然而，由于雷达测量值受到噪声、干扰和杂波等无效因素的污染，需要在使用神经网络进行三维目标检测之前进行预处理算法。在本文中，我们提出了RTNH+，它是RTNH的增强版本，是一种4D雷达目标检测网络，采用了两种新算法。第一种算法是基于恒定虚警率（CFAR）的两级预处理（CCTP）算法，它使用相同的4D雷达测量值生成两个具有不同特征的滤波测量值，可以丰富输入到4D雷达目标检测网络的信息。第二种是垂直编码（VE）算法，可以有效地从CCTP输出中编码道路目标的垂直特征。我们提供了RTNH+的详细信息。",
