    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLM）在各种任务中取得了显著的成功，但对其安全性和生成恶意内容的潜在风险的担忧也浮现出来。本文探讨了在相同上下文学习（ICL）中操纵LLM对齐能力的效果。我们发现，仅通过少量的上下文示范而无需微调，就可以操纵LLM增加或降低越狱概率，即回答恶意提示。基于这些观察，我们提出了用于越狱和对齐语言模型目的的相同上下文攻击（ICA）和相同上下文防御（ICD）方法。ICA通过构造恶意上下文指导模型生成有害输出，而ICD通过拒绝回答有害提示的示范来增强模型的稳健性。我们的实验证明了ICA和ICD在增加或降低对抗越狱攻击成功率方面的有效性。总的来说，我们揭示了ICL在越狱和对齐语言模型领域的潜力。",
