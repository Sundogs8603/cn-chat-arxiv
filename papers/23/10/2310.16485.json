    "translated_abstract": "时间序列数据中的事件检测在金融、医疗保健、网络安全和科学等各个领域都至关重要。准确地识别时间序列数据中的事件对于做出明智决策、检测异常和预测未来趋势至关重要。尽管针对时间序列的事件检测已经进行了广泛的研究，其中深度学习方法是最先进的方法之一，但在这个领域仍有改进和创新的空间。本文提出了一种新的深度学习监督方法，用于检测多元时间序列数据中的事件。与现有的深度学习监督方法相比，我们的方法结合了四个独特的创新。首先，它基于回归而不是二元分类。其次，它不需要标记的数据集，每个数据点都有标签；相反，它只需要定义为时间点或时间间隔的参考事件。第三，它通过使用堆叠集成模型设计得到了鲁棒性。",
