    "translated_abstract": "天气雷达数据对于即时预报至关重要，并且是数值天气预测模型的一个组成部分。尽管天气雷达数据提供了高分辨率的宝贵信息，但其基于地面的特性限制了其可用性，这阻碍了大规模应用。相比之下，气象卫星覆盖了更大的区域，但分辨率更低。然而，随着数据驱动方法和地球同步卫星上现代传感器的快速发展，新的机会正在出现，以弥合地面和空间观测之间的差距，最终实现更准确的高技能天气预报。在这里，我们提出了一种基于Transformer模型的方法，利用卫星数据对地面雷达图像序列进行即时预报，提前两小时。该模型在反映严重天气条件的数据集上进行训练，预测出现在不同天气现象下的雷达场。",
