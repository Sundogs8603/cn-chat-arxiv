    "abstract": "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are rich sources of patient-level data, including laboratory tests, medications, and diagnoses, offering valuable resources for medical data analysis. However, concerns about privacy often restrict access to EHRs, hindering downstream analysis. Researchers have explored various methods for generating privacy-preserving EHR data. In this study, we introduce a new method for generating diverse and realistic synthetic EHR time series data using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). We conducted experiments on six datasets, comparing our proposed method with seven existing methods. Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms all existing methods in terms of data utility while requiring less training effort. Our approach also enhances downstream medical data analysis by providing diverse and realistic synthetic EHR data.",

    "translated_abstract": "电子健康记录（EHR）是丰富的患者级数据来源，包括实验室检验、药物和诊断，为医疗数据分析提供了宝贵资源。然而，对隐私的担忧常常限制了对EHR的访问，阻碍了下游分析。研究人员已经探索了各种方法来生成保护隐私的EHR数据。在本研究中，我们引入了一种使用去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）生成多样化和真实的合成EHR时间序列数据的新方法。我们对六个数据集进行了实验证明，我们的方法在数据效用方面明显优于七种现有方法，并且需要更少的训练工作。我们的方法还通过提供多样化和真实的合成EHR数据来增强下游医疗数据分析。",
