    "translated_abstract": "多目标跟踪(MOT)是自动驾驶感知系统的基本组成部分，其对未知条件的稳健性是避免生命危险故障的要求。尽管在驾驶系统中安全性迫切，但从未提出过解决多目标跟踪适应问题到测试时间条件中的解决方案。然而，MOT系统的本质是多样的，需要物体检测和实例关联，适应其所有组件是非常困难的。在本文中，我们分析了外观跟踪器在域漂移上的影响，并介绍了DARTH，一种全面的多目标跟踪测试时间自适应框架。我们提出了一种检测一致性公式，以自我监督方式适应目标检测，同时通过我们的新型补丁对比损失来适应实例外观表示。我们在各种域漂移下进行了方法评估，包括模拟到真实，户外到室内，室内到户外，并大幅改进了原始方法。",
