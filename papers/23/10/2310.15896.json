    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have performed well in providing general and extensive health suggestions in single-turn conversations, exemplified by systems such as ChatGPT, ChatGLM, ChatDoctor, DoctorGLM, and etc. However, the limited information provided by users during single turn results in inadequate personalization and targeting of the generated suggestions, which requires users to independently select the useful part. It is mainly caused by the missing ability to engage in multi-turn questioning. In real-world medical consultations, doctors usually employ a series of iterative inquiries to comprehend the patient's condition thoroughly, enabling them to provide effective and personalized suggestions subsequently, which can be defined as chain of questioning (CoQ) for LLMs. To improve the CoQ of LLMs, we propose BianQue, a ChatGLM-based LLM finetuned with the self-constructed health conversation dataset BianQueCorpus that is consist of multiple turns of questioning and health sugge",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在单轮会话中提供广泛的健康建议方面表现出色，例如ChatGPT、ChatGLM、ChatDoctor、DoctorGLM等系统。然而，用户在单轮中提供的信息有限，导致生成的建议个性化和针对性不足，需要用户独立选择有用的部分。这主要是由于缺乏参与多轮提问的能力。为了改进LLMs的多轮提问能力，我们提出了BianQue，一种基于ChatGLM的LLMs模型，通过自建的健康对话数据集BianQueCorpus进行微调，该数据集包含多轮提问和健康建议的内容。",
