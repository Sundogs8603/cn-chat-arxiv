    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)已被证明可以作为自动化评估器，用于评估AI系统生成的答案的质量。然而，这些基于LLM的评估器在使用对比评估候选答案时存在位置偏差或不一致性，无视内容而偏向于第一个或第二个答案。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了PORTIA，这是一个基于对齐的系统，旨在模拟人类的比较策略，以轻量级但有效的方式校准位置偏差。具体而言，PORTIA将答案分割成多个片段，对比候选答案中的相似内容进行对齐，并将它们合并回一个单一的提示，以供LLMs评估。我们使用六种不同的LLM进行了大量实验，评估了11,520个答案对。我们的结果表明，PORTIA显著提高了所有模型和对比形式的一致性率，平均相对改进率达到47.46%。引人注目的是，PORTIA使得LLMs能够评估中对位置偏差进行校准的创新方法，从而提高了评估的准确性和公正性。",
