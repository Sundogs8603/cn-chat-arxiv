    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新颖的评估框架，用于评估潜在因素推荐算法中的表示偏见。我们的框架引入了属性关联偏见的概念，让从业人员可以探索推荐系统如何引入或放大利益相关者表达上的伤害。当敏感属性在训练的推荐潜在空间中被语义捕捉或纠缠时，就会出现属性关联偏见（AAB）。这种偏见可能导致推荐者强化有害的刻板印象，从而可能对系统的使用者和供应者利益相关者造成进一步的表达伤害。潜在因素推荐模型由于能够将显式和隐式属性纠缠在训练的潜在空间中，因此容易遭受AAB的影响。由于在混合工业推荐系统中，实体向量作为属性在下游组件中的使用越来越常见，因此理解这种现象是非常重要的。我们为从业人员提供了一个框架，可以帮助他们评估和解决AAB问题。",
