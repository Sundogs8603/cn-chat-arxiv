    "abstract": "Background: Here we investigate whether releasing COVID-19 vaccines in limited quantities and at limited times boosted Italy's vaccination campaign in 2021. This strategy exploits insights from psychology and consumer marketing. Methods: We built an original dataset covering 200 days of vaccination data in Italy, including 'open day' events. Open-day events (in short: open days) are instances where COVID-19 vaccines were released in limited quantities and only for a specific day at a specified location (usually, a large pavilion or a public building). Our dependent variables are the number of total and first doses administered in proportion to the eligible population. Our key independent variable is the presence of open-day events in a given region on a specific day. We analyzed the data using regression with fixed effects for time and region. The analysis was robust to alternative model specifications. Findings: We find that when an open day event was organized, in proportion to the e",
