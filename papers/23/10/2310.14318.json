Modeling a user's latent intention can significantly improve the performance of recommendations. Previous works model users' intentions by considering the predefined label in auxiliary information or introducing stochastic data augmentation to learn purposes in the latent space. However, the auxiliary information is sparse and not always available for recommender systems, and introducing stochastic data augmentation may introduce noise and thus change the intentions hidden in the sequence. Therefore, leveraging user intentions for sequential recommendation (SR) can be challenging because they are frequently varied and unobserved.

    "translated_abstract": "用户的购买行为主要受到他们的意图影响（例如，购买装饰用的衣服，购买画画用的画笔等）。建模用户的潜在意图可以显著提高推荐的性能。先前的工作通过考虑辅助信息中的预定义标签或引入随机数据增强来建模用户的意图。然而，辅助信息是稀疏的，并且对于推荐系统并不总是可用的，引入随机数据增强可能会引入噪声，从而改变序列中隐藏的意图。因此，利用用户的意图进行顺序推荐可能具有挑战性，因为它们经常变化且不可观察。本文提出了用于顺序推荐的意图对比学习与交叉子序列（ICSRec），用于建模用户的潜在意图。",
