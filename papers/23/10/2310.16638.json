    "translated_abstract": "在一种情况下，我们可以访问具有协变量和结果的训练数据，而测试数据只包含协变量。在这种情况下，我们的主要目标是预测测试数据中缺失的结果。为了实现这个目标，我们在协变量偏移下训练参数回归模型，其中训练数据和测试数据之间的协变量分布不同。对于这个问题，现有研究提出了通过使用密度比的重要性加权来进行协变量偏移适应的方法。该方法通过对训练数据损失进行加权平均，每个权重是训练数据和测试数据之间的协变量密度比的估计，以近似测试数据的风险。尽管它允许我们获得一个最小化测试数据风险的模型，但其性能严重依赖于密度比估计的准确性。此外，即使密度比可以一致地估计，密度比的估计误差也会导致回归模型的估计器产生偏差。",
