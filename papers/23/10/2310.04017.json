    "translated_abstract": "发现和开发新药是一项复杂且资源密集型的工作，通常涉及大量成本、时间投入和安全问题。药物发现的一个关键方面是确定新颖的药物-靶标（DT）相互作用。现有的预测DT相互作用的计算方法主要集中在二分类任务上，旨在确定DT对是否存在相互作用。然而，蛋白质-配体相互作用表现出一系列不同结合强度，即结合亲和力，这对准确预测造成了持续挑战。在本研究中，我们研究了在药物靶标相互作用（DTI）预测中使用的各种技术，并提出了改进性能的新方法。我们的方法包括整合蛋白质语言模型（PLMs）和将接触图信息作为现有模型的归纳偏差。通过广泛的实验，我们证明了我们提出的方法的性能优于传统方法。",
