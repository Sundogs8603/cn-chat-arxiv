    "abstract": "A major obstacle when attempting to train a machine learning system to evaluate facial clefts is the scarcity of large datasets of high-quality, ethics board-approved patient images. In response, we have built a deep learning-based cleft lip generator designed to produce an almost unlimited number of artificial images exhibiting high-fidelity facsimiles of cleft lip with wide variation. We undertook a transfer learning protocol testing different versions of StyleGAN-ADA (a generative adversarial network image generator incorporating adaptive data augmentation (ADA)) as the base model. Training images depicting a variety of cleft deformities were pre-processed to adjust for rotation, scaling, color adjustment and background blurring. The ADA modification of the primary algorithm permitted construction of our new generative model while requiring input of a relatively small number of training images. Adversarial training was carried out using 514 unique frontal photographs of cleft-affect",

    "translated_abstract": "在训练面部唇裂评估机器学习系统时的一个主要障碍是缺乏大量高质量且经道德委员会批准的患者图像数据集。为了应对这个问题，我们构建了一个基于深度学习的唇裂生成器，旨在产生出具有高保真度的唇裂图像的几乎无限数量，且具有广泛的变化。我们进行了一项转移学习协议，测试了基于StyleGAN-ADA的不同版本（一种包含自适应数据增强(ADA)的生成对抗网络图像生成器）作为基础模型。通过对描绘不同唇裂畸形的训练图像进行预处理，调整了旋转、缩放、颜色调整和背景模糊。主要算法的ADA修改允许构建我们的新生成模型，同时需要输入相对较少的训练图像。通过使用514张独特的正脸唇裂照片进行对抗性训练，验证了生成模型的效果。",
