    "translated_abstract": "不平衡的法官与案件比例对司法系统产生了繁重的影响，表现为大量积压的未决案件以及持续涌入的新案件。为了解决这个问题并加快司法程序，提出了利用事实证据和过去案件的先例来推测案件结果的自动化系统的建议变得重要。本研究论文侧重于开发基于图神经网络的模型来解决法律判决预测（LJP）问题，识别司法案件的内在图结构，并将其转化为二进制节点分类问题。我们探索了各种嵌入作为模型特征，同时添加和修剪了时间节点和司法行为节点以评估模型的性能。本研究还考虑了这些预测的公平性的伦理维度，考虑了性别和姓名的偏见。还进行了链接预测任务以评估模型对未来案件的熟练程度。",
