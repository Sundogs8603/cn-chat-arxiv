In this paper, we propose a new machine learning model that is based on the Ising structure and can be efficiently trained using gradient descent. We provide a mathematical characterization of the training process, which is based upon optimizing a loss function whose partial derivatives are not explicitly calculated but estimated by the Ising machine itself. Moreover, we present some experimental results on the training and execution of the proposed learning model. These results point out new possibilities offered by Ising machines for different learning tasks.
