    "abstract": "This paper presents \"AI Nushu,\" an emerging language system inspired by Nushu (women's scripts), the unique language created and used exclusively by ancient Chinese women who were thought to be illiterate under a patriarchal society. In this interactive installation, two artificial intelligence (AI) agents are trained in the Chinese dictionary and the Nushu corpus. By continually observing their environment and communicating, these agents collaborate towards creating a standard writing system to encode Chinese. It offers an artistic interpretation of the creation of a non-western script from a computational linguistics perspective, integrating AI technology with Chinese cultural heritage and a feminist viewpoint.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了“AI Nushu”，这是一种受女书（女性专用文字）启发的新兴语言系统，女书是古代中国女性在一个父权社会中被认为是文盲而创造并独自使用的独特语言。在这个交互式装置中，两个人工智能（AI）代理人通过对中文字典和女书语料库的训练，不断观察环境并进行交流，合作创造一个标准的中文写作系统。它从计算语言学的角度提供了一种艺术性解释，将AI技术与中国文化遗产和女权主义视角相结合，创造了一种非西方文字的创作过程。",

It combines computational linguistics, Chinese cultural heritage, and a feminist viewpoint to collaboratively create a standard writing system with two AI agents."
