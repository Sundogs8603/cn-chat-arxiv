    "translated_abstract": "生成式人工智能（GenAI）和大型语言模型（LLM）是技术的奇迹，以其在自然语言处理和多模式内容生成方面的卓越能力而受到赞扬，它们承诺带来一个变革的未来。但就像所有强大的工具一样，它们也有其阴影存在。想象一下生活在一个深度伪造与现实无法区分、合成身份组织恶意活动、以及有着无与伦比精确度的有针对性的虚假信息或欺诈手法的世界。欢迎来到GenAI应用的黑暗面。本文不仅是探索GenAI和LLMs潜在滥用的旅程，也是呼吁认识到面临的挑战的紧迫性。在我们航行于虚假信息活动、恶意内容生成与精密恶意软件构建的海洋中，我们将揭示这场我们正在见证的GenAI革命中的社会影响。",
