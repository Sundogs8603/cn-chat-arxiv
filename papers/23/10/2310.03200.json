The models predict book ratings column using various PySpark Machine Learning APIs. Additionally, we used hyper-parameters and parameters tuning. Also, Cross Validation and TrainValidationSplit were used for generalization. Finally, we performed a comparison between Binary Classification and Multiclass Classification in their accuracies. We converted our label from multiclass to binary to see if we could find any difference between the two classifications. As a result, we found out that we get higher accuracy in b",

    "translated_abstract": "本文利用亚马逊的数据集来预测亚马逊网站上列出的图书评分。作为这个项目的一部分，我们预测了图书的评分，并构建了一个推荐集群。这个推荐集群基于数据集中的列值，比如类别、描述、作者、价格、评论等提供推荐图书。本文提供了处理大数据文件、数据工程、构建模型和提供预测的流程。模型使用了各种PySpark机器学习API来预测图书评分列。此外，我们使用超参数和参数调优。另外，我们还使用了交叉验证和TrainValidationSplit进行泛化。最后，我们比较了二分类和多分类在准确性上的差异。我们将标签从多分类转换为二分类以查看两种分类之间是否有差异。结果表明，我们在二分类中获得了更高的准确性。",
