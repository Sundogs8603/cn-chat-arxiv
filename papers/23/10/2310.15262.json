    "abstract": "Code-switching (CSW) text generation has been receiving increasing attention as a solution to address data scarcity. In light of this growing interest, we need more comprehensive studies comparing different augmentation approaches. In this work, we compare three popular approaches: lexical replacements, linguistic theories, and back-translation (BT), in the context of Egyptian Arabic-English CSW. We assess the effectiveness of the approaches on machine translation and the quality of augmentations through human evaluation. We show that BT and CSW predictive-based lexical replacement, being trained on CSW parallel data, perform best on both tasks. Linguistic theories and random lexical replacement prove to be effective in the lack of CSW parallel data, where both approaches achieve similar results.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着数据稀缺问题的日益引起关注，代码交替（CSW）文本生成作为解决方案受到越来越多的关注。在这个增长的兴趣背景下，我们需要更多全面的研究来比较不同的增强方法。在这项工作中，我们比较了三种流行的方法：词汇替换、语言理论和回译（BT），在埃及阿拉伯语-英语CSW的背景下。通过人工评估，我们评估了这些方法在机器翻译上的效果以及增强的质量。我们显示回译和基于CSW预测的词汇替换在两个任务上表现最佳，因为它们是在CSW的平行数据上训练的。而在缺乏CSW平行数据的情况下，语言理论和随机词汇替换证明是有效的，两种方法的结果相似。",
