    "translated_abstract": "对话代理在工业和学术界正在受到越来越多的关注，尤其是随着生成式人工智能和大型语言模型的出现。随着这些代理在公众中的广泛使用以及承担了一系列关键的用例和社会角色，考虑到这些系统中嵌入的价值观变得非常重要。这个考虑包括回答诸如“谁的价值观被嵌入到这些代理中？”和“这些价值观在正在设计的代理中如何体现？”等问题。因此，本文的目的是介绍一种价值感知对话代理共同设计框架，以便与相关利益相关者共同设计价值感知的对话代理。首先，在此总结了以前的工作中确定的设计价值感知对话代理的共同设计要求。其次，介绍并讨论了实际框架，包括其在设计工具包中的操作化。该框架促进了共同设计。",
