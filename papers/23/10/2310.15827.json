    "translated_abstract": "从3D医学图像中自动分割主动脉是一项重要但困难的任务。许多因素使得这个问题具有挑战性，比如主动脉夹层的可能性或者对小分支进行分割和注释的困难。本文介绍了MedGIFT团队在MICCAI 2023会议期间组织的SEG.A挑战中的一项贡献。我们提出了一种基于深度编码-解码器架构的全自动算法。我们的工作的主要假设是在低数据情况下，数据预处理和增强比深度架构更重要。因此，解决方案基于传统的卷积U-Net的变体。提出的解决方案在所有测试案例中都实现了0.9以上的Dice分数，并且在所有参与者中具有最高的稳定性。该方法在临床评估、定量结果和体积网格质量方面分别排名第一、第四和第三。我们免费公开源代码，",
