    "abstract": "Natural Language Processing prides itself to be an empirically-minded, if not outright empiricist field, and yet lately it seems to get itself into essentialist debates on issues of meaning and measurement (\"Do Large Language Models Understand Language, And If So, How Much?\"). This is not by accident: Here, as everywhere, the evidence underspecifies the understanding. As a remedy, this paper sketches the outlines of a model of understanding, which can ground questions of the adequacy of current methods of measurement of model quality. The paper makes three claims: A) That different language use situation types have different characteristics, B) That language understanding is a multifaceted phenomenon, bringing together individualistic and social processes, and C) That the choice of Understanding Indicator marks the limits of benchmarking, and the beginnings of considerations of the ethics of NLP use.",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理自称是一个以经验为导向的领域，但最近它似乎卷入了关于意义和测量问题的实质性争论（“大型语言模型是否理解语言，如果理解的话，程度如何？”）。这并不是偶然的：在这里，就像在任何地方一样，证据并不能充分说明理解。为了解决这个问题，本文概述了一个理解模型的轮廓，用于评估当前模型质量测量方法的适当性问题。本文提出了三个观点：A）不同的语言使用情景类型具有不同的特征，B）语言理解是一个多方面的现象，汇集了个体主义和社会过程，C）理解指标的选择标志着基准测试的界限以及自然语言处理应用的道德思考的开始。",
