    "translated_abstract": "MentalRiskES是一个新颖的挑战，旨在解决与西班牙语早期风险检测相关的问题。目标是尽早检测到显示出不同任务的心理障碍迹象的Telegram用户。任务1涉及饮食障碍的检测，任务2关注抑郁症的检测，任务3旨在检测一种未知的障碍。这些任务被分成子任务，每个子任务定义了一种解决方法。我们的研究小组参与了任务1和任务2的子任务A：一个二元分类问题，评估用户是积极还是消极。为了解决这些任务，我们提出了基于Transformer的模型，并根据早期检测框架定义的标准进行决策策略。其中一个模型呈现了每个任务解决的重要词汇的扩展词汇表。此外，我们应用了基于模型进行预测历史的决策策略。",
