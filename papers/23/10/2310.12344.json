    "abstract": "End-to-end Transformers have demonstrated an impressive success rate for Embodied Instruction Following when the environment has been seen in training. However, they tend to struggle when deployed in an unseen environment. This lack of generalizability is due to the agent's insensitivity to subtle changes in natural language instructions. To mitigate this issue, we propose explicitly aligning the agent's hidden states with the instructions via contrastive learning. Nevertheless, the semantic gap between high-level language instructions and the agent's low-level action space remains an obstacle. Therefore, we further introduce a novel concept of meta-actions to bridge the gap. Meta-actions are ubiquitous action patterns that can be parsed from the original action sequence. These patterns represent higher-level semantics that are intuitively aligned closer to the instructions. When meta-actions are applied as additional training signals, the agent generalizes better to unseen environment",

    "translated_abstract": "当环境在训练中被看到时，端到端的Transformer在具象指令跟随方面表现出了令人印象深刻的成功率。然而，当它们在未知环境中部署时往往遇到困难。这种缺乏泛化能力是由于智能体对自然语言指令中的细微变化不敏感。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了通过对比学习将智能体的隐藏状态与指令明确对齐。然而，高级语言指令与智能体的低级行动空间之间的语义差距仍然是一个障碍。因此，我们进一步引入了元行动的新概念来弥合这个差距。元行动是从原始行动序列中解析出来的普遍行动模式。这些模式代表了更高层次的语义，直观上更接近指令。当元行动被应用为额外的训练信号时，智能体在未知环境中的泛化能力更好。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种名为LACMA的方法，通过对比学习实现了智能体与指令的语言对齐，进而通过引入元行动的概念来解决高级语言指令与低级行动空间之间的语义差距，从而提高了智能体在未知环境中的泛化能力。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method called LACMA, which achieves language alignment between agents and instructions through contrastive learning, and further addresses the semantic gap between high-level language instructions and low-level action space by introducing the concept of meta-actions, thereby improving the agent's generalization ability in unseen environments."
