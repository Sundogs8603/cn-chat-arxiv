    "translated_abstract": "数据可视化是在各个领域探索和传达洞察力的强大工具。为了自动化数据集的可视化选择，提出了一种称为可视化推荐的任务。为此目的已经开发了各种基于机器学习的方法，但它们通常需要大量数据集-可视化对的训练语料库，并且缺乏自然解释其结果的能力。为了填补这一研究空白，我们提出了LLM4Vis，一种基于ChatGPT的新型提示方法，用于进行可视化推荐并返回类似人类的解释，只使用非常少的示例演示。我们的方法涉及特征描述，示例演示选择，解释生成，示例演示构建和推理步骤。为了获得具有高质量解释的示例演示，我们提出了一种新的解释生成引导方法，通过考虑前一代和模板来迭代地改进生成的解释。",
