    "translated_abstract": "将联邦学习（FL）快速整合到网络中涵盖了网络管理、服务质量和网络安全等各个方面，同时保护数据隐私。在这种情况下，分散式联邦学习（DFL）作为一种创新范式，用于训练协作模型，解决了单点失效的限制。然而，FL和DFL的安全性和可信性受到污染攻击的影响，从而对其性能产生负面影响。现有的防御机制针对集中式FL进行设计，并未充分利用DFL的特点。因此，本文引入了Sentinel，一种在DFL中对抗污染攻击的防御策略。Sentinel利用本地数据的可访问性，定义了一个三步聚合协议，包括相似性过滤、引导验证和标准化，以防止恶意模型更新。通过使用不同数据集和不同的评估指标对Sentinel进行了评估。",
