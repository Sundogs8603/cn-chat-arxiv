    "translated_abstract": "微卫星不稳定性高（MSI-H）是免疫检查点抑制剂疗法的一种肿瘤不可知标志物。然而，在前列腺癌中，由于低患病率和检测成本较高，MSI状态通常不进行常规测试。因此，从血液染色剂靛蓝和伊红（H&E）染色的全切片图像（WSIs）中预测MSI状态，可以识别出最有可能受益于确认测试并有资格接受免疫治疗的前列腺癌患者。分析了连续转诊至我们机构的前列腺癌患者的去匿名记录中的前列腺活检和手术切除标本。通过下一代测序确定了他们的MSI状态。在截止日期之前的患者分为算法开发集（n=4015, MSI-H 1.8%）和配对验证集（n=173, MSI-H 19.7%），每个样本由两个连续的切片组成，一个内部染色和扫描，另一个在外部某个地点。截止日期之后的患者形成了时间验证集。",
