    "translated_abstract": "大图的最密子图通常指的是具有最高平均度的一些子图，这已经被Veldt等人扩展到了$p$-平均密集子图目标的家族上。$p$-平均密集子图问题寻找具有最高平均$p$次幂度的子图，而标准最密子图问题寻找具有最高平均度的子图。已经证明了当$p>1$时，标准剥离算法在广义目标上可以表现得任意差，但当$0<p<1$时不确定。在本文中，我们首次证明了标准剥离算法在$0<p<1$的情况下仍然可以得到$2^{1/p}$的近似解。Veldt等人提出了一种新的广义剥离算法（GENPEEL），对于$p \\geq 1$，其近似保证率为$(p+1)^{1/p}$，时间复杂度为$O(mn)$，其中$m$和$n$分别表示图中的边数和节点数。在算法贡献方面，我们提出了一种新的算法。",
