    "translated_abstract": "衰减校正（AC）对于生成无伪迹和定量准确的正电子发射断层扫描（PET）图像至关重要。然而，PET的AC面临着挑战，包括扫描间的运动和将结构性体素强度错误转换为PET衰减校正因子。如今，在PET与计算机断层扫描（CT）相结合的设备商业化之后，用于定量PET的AC问题在很大程度上得到了解决。同时，考虑到无解剖成像的深度学习方法用于PET AC的可行性，本文开发了一种PET AC方法，该方法使用深度学习从非衰减校正的PET图像中生成连续值CT图像以进行脑PET成像的AC。具体而言，提出了一种结合变量增强策略的可逆网络，可以实现双向推断过程，用于合成CT生成（IVNAC）。为了评估所提议方法的性能，进行了各种实验证明。",
