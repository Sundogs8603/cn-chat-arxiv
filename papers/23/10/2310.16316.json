    "abstract": "An explanation of a machine learning model is considered \"faithful\" if it accurately reflects the model's decision-making process. However, explanations such as feature attributions for deep learning are not guaranteed to be faithful, and can produce potentially misleading interpretations. In this work, we develop Sum-of-Parts (SOP), a class of models whose predictions come with grouped feature attributions that are faithful-by-construction. This model decomposes a prediction into an interpretable sum of scores, each of which is directly attributable to a sparse group of features. We evaluate SOP on benchmarks with standard interpretability metrics, and in a case study, we use the faithful explanations from SOP to help astrophysicists discover new knowledge about galaxy formation.",

    "translated_abstract": "如果机器学习模型的解释准确反映了其决策过程，则被认为是“忠实”的解释。然而，例如深度学习的特征归因等解释并不能保证忠实，有可能产生具有误导性的解释。在这项工作中，我们开发了Sum-of-Parts（SOP）模型，它是一类模型，其预测具有通过构造保证忠实的特征组归因。该模型将预测分解为可解释的分数之和，每个分数直接归因于一组稀疏特征。我们使用标准可解释性指标对SOP进行评估，并在一个案例研究中，利用SOP提供的忠实解释帮助天体物理学家发现了关于星系形成的新知识。",
