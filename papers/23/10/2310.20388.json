    "translated_abstract": "基于因果关系的推荐系统关注用户与物品交互的因果效应，即物品的推荐或暴露给用户的情况，而不是传统的基于相关性的推荐。由于对用户、卖家和平台都有多方面的好处，这类推荐系统越来越受欢迎。然而，现有的基于因果关系的推荐方法需要额外的输入，即暴露数据和/或倾向得分（即暴露的概率）进行训练。由于技术或隐私限制，现实世界中往往无法获得这些对于建模推荐因果关系至关重要的数据。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的框架，名为基于因果关系的倾向估计（PropCare）。它可以从一种更实际的设置中估计倾向和暴露，即只有交互数据可用，没有关于暴露或倾向的任何真实数据。",
