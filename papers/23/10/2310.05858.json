    "translated_abstract": "强化学习在处理复杂的决策和控制任务方面已经被证明非常有效。然而，常见的无模型的强化学习方法往往面临严重的性能下降问题，这是由于众所周知的过估计问题所引起的。作为对这个问题的回应，我们最近引入了一种离线策略的强化学习算法，称为分布式软角色扮演者评论者（DSAC或DSAC-v1），它通过学习连续的高斯值分布来有效提高值估计的准确性。然而，标准DSAC也存在一些缺点，包括时而不稳定的学习过程和对任务特定的奖励缩放的需求，这可能会阻碍其在一些特殊任务中的整体性能和适应性。本文进一步引入了三个对标准DSAC的重要改进，以解决这些问题。这些改进包括评论者梯度调整、双值分布学习和基于方差的目标回报裁剪。修改后的强化学习算法称为DSAC-T。",
