    "translated_abstract": "可解释的人工智能（XAI）已成为处理关键任务应用时的必备要求，确保所使用的黑盒子人工智能模型的透明度和可解释性。XAI的重要性涵盖了各个领域，从医疗保健到金融，在这些领域中，了解深度学习算法的决策过程是至关重要的。大多数基于人工智能的计算机视觉模型往往是黑盒子，因此在图像处理中提供深度神经网络的可解释性对于它们在医疗图像分析、自动驾驶和遥感应用中的广泛采用和部署至关重要。最近，已经提出了几种针对图像分类任务的XAI方法。相比之下，在可解释性方面，图像分割在计算机视觉应用中，特别是在遥感领域中，受到了相对较少的关注。只有少数研究提出了基于梯度的XAI算法来进行图像分割。",
