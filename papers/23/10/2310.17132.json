    "translated_abstract": "基于消息传递范式，已经有大量研究提出了各种各样令人印象深刻的特征传播机制来提高GNN的性能。然而，对于特征转换，消息传递框架的另一个重要操作，关注较少。在本文中，我们首先经验性地研究了几种典型GNN中特征转换操作的性能。意外的是，我们注意到GNN没有完全释放出内在的特征转换操作的能力。基于这一观察，我们提出了双向知识传递（BiKT），一种插拔式方法，旨在释放特征转换操作的潜力，而不修改原始架构。将特征转换操作视为与原始GNN共享参数的派生表示学习模型，通过该模型的直接预测提供了一种与拓扑无关的知识反馈，进一步指导了GNN的学习过程。",

By studying the performance of feature transformation operations in typical GNNs, it is found that GNNs do not fully utilize the power of these operations."
