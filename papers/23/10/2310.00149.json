    "translated_abstract": "设计一个能够解决多个任务的单一模型一直是人工智能领域的长期目标。最近，大型语言模型展示了在语言领域内整合和解决不同任务的异常能力。然而，在图学习领域，针对各种任务的统一模型仍然未被充分探索，主要是由于图学习领域独特的挑战。首先，来自不同领域的图数据具有不同的属性和遵循不同的分布。这种差异使得很难将图表示在一个统一的表示空间中。其次，图上的任务分化为节点、链接和图任务，需要不同的嵌入策略。最后，关于上下文学习的适当图提示范式尚不清楚。为了应对上述挑战，我们提出了\"一刀切\"（OFA），这是第一个能够使用单一图模型来解决上述挑战的通用框架。",
    "tldr": "这项研究提出了一种名为“一刀切”的通用框架，该框架能够使用单一图模型解决不同领域的多个任务。该框架克服了图学习领域的挑战，包括不同属性和分布的图数据、不同类型的任务以及上下文学习的问题。",
    "en_tdlr": "This research introduces a general framework called \"One for All\" that utilizes a single graph model to solve multiple tasks in different domains. The framework addresses challenges in graph learning, including different attributes and distributions of graph data, diverse types of tasks, and the issue of in-context learning."
