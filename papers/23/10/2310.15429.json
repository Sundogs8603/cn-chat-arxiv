    "translated_abstract": "情感分析被广泛批评仅能捕捉到语料库的整体情感，无法准确反映文本中的潜在结构和政治立场。本研究引入了主题度量，将从提取的主题转化而来的虚拟变量，作为情感度量在立场分类中的替代和补充。通过应用Bestvater和Monroe（2023）确定的三个数据集，本研究展示了BERTopic在提取连贯主题和主题度量在立场分类中的有效性。实验结果显示，与传统方法如Dirichlet分配（LDA）和非负矩阵分解（NMF）相比，BERTopic提高了17.07%至54.20%的连贯性分数，这些传统方法在早期政治学研究中很常见。此外，我们的结果表明，主题度量在立场分类中优于情感度量，性能提高了高达18.95%。我们的研究结果表明，主题度量是一种有效的方法来理解文本中的政治立场。",
