We use the model to assess the distributional and welfare impact of recent price changes in Pakistan. Particular attention is paid to price changes in energy goods and food. We firstly assessed the distributional pattern of expenditures, with domestic energy fuels concentrated at the bottom of the distribution and motor fuels at the top. The budget share of electricity and motor fuels is particularly high, while domestic fuels is relatively low. While the distributional pattern of domestic fuel and electricity consumption is similar to other countries, there is a particularly high budget elasticity for motor fuels.

    "translated_abstract": "本文利用家庭预算调查数据、收入调查数据和输入产出模型开发了一个微模拟模型，模拟了价格变动的分布影响。我们利用该模型评估了巴基斯坦近期价格变动的分配和福利影响，特别关注能源和食品价格的变动。首先，我们评估了支出的分布模式，国内能源燃料集中在分布的底部，汽油燃料在顶部。电力和汽油燃料的预算份额特别高，而国内燃料相对较低。虽然国内燃料和电力消费的分布模式与其他国家相似，但汽油燃料有特别高的预算弹性。分析表明，尽管能源价格大幅增加，但能源价格对通货膨胀带来的福利损失的重要性有限。近期价格变动的总体分布影响较小。",
