    "translated_abstract": "时间序列预测在各个领域都是一个重要而具有挑战性的任务。最近，基于模态分解的方法在复杂时间序列的预测中占据主导地位，因为它能够捕捉局部特征并从数据中提取内在模态的优势。然而，大多数模型无法捕捉包含重要信息的暗含波动性。为了提高当前、快速演变和波动性时间序列的预测能力，我们提出了一种新颖的分解-集成范式，即VMD-LSTM-GARCH模型。该模型使用变分模态分解算法将时间序列分解为K个子模态。随后，GARCH模型从这些子模态中提取波动性信息，这些信息作为LSTM的输入。每个子模态的数值和波动性信息被用来训练一个长短期记忆网络。该网络预测子模态，然后我们将所有子模态的预测结果进行聚合。",
