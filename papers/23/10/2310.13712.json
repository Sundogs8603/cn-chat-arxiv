    "translated_abstract": "面对不断增长的教室规模和教师资源有限的问题，个性化的基于聊天机器人的教学助手可以发挥关键作用。大型语言模型（LLMs）提供了有希望的途径，越来越多的研究探索它们在教育中的实用性。然而，挑战不仅在于确定LLMs的有效性，而且在于识别学习者与这些模型之间的互动细微差别，这会影响学习者的参与和成果。我们在一个本科计算机科学课堂（N=145）和Prolific上进行了一项形成性研究（N=356），以探索四种教学指导策略对学习者在LLMs上的表现、自信心和信任度的影响。直接的LLM答案稍微提高了表现，而改进学生的解决方案增加了信任度。结构化指导减少了随机查询和学生将作业问题复制粘贴给LLM的情况。我们的工作凸显了t",
