We propose such an ADMM algorithm and show in a realistic [18F]-FDG synthetic brain exam that the proposed scheme indeed lead experimentally to convergence to a meaningful fixed point.

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们研究了基于模型驱动变分重建和应用独立学习的深度神经网络操作符（DNN）的混合PET重建算法，采用ADMM插入法框架。根据最近在优化方面的结果，在学习过程中对网络参数施加额外的约束可以实现算法的固定点收敛。我们提出了这样一个ADMM算法，并通过在逼真的[18F]-FDG合成脑部检查中展示了所提出的方案确实实验上收敛到一个有意义的固定点。当在DNN的学习过程中未施加所提出的约束时，实验观察到所提出的ADMM算法无法收敛。",
