    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习使多个客户端能够共同为由中央服务器组织的全局模型的学习做出贡献。这种学习方案促进了客户端的数据隐私并减少了通信开销。在网络流量分类等应用中，这有助于隐藏网络的漏洞和弱点。然而，联邦学习对后门攻击是脆弱的，即对手向全局模型中注入篡改的模型更新。这些更新在全局模型中注入了显著的功能，可以通过特定的输入模式来启动。尽管如此，基于联邦学习的网络流量分类模型对于这些攻击的脆弱性仍未被探索。在本文中，我们提出了GABAttack，一种基于遗传算法的针对基于联邦学习的网络流量分类的新型后门攻击方法。GABAttack利用遗传算法来优化后门触发器参数的值和位置。",
