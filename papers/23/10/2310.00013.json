    "translated_abstract": "通过通信允许车辆交换补充信息，多个连接的自动驾驶车辆之间的协同感知可以极大地增强感知能力。尽管之前的方法取得了进展，但由于通道变化和协同车辆之间的数据异构性，仍然存在挑战。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了ACC-DA，一个通道感知的协同感知框架，它可以动态调整通信图并最小化平均传输延迟，同时减轻数据异构性带来的副作用。我们的创新点包括三个方面。首先，我们设计了一种最小化传输延迟的方法，根据不同的通道信息状态构建通信图并最小化传输延迟。然后，我们提出了一种自适应数据重构机制，可以动态调整码率-畸变折衷以增强感知效率。此外，它最小化了时域丢失。",
