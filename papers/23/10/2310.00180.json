The current widely adopted building archetypes are developed on a nationwide scale, potentially neglecting the impact of local buildings' geometric specificities. We present Multi-scale Archetype Representation Learning (MARL), an approach that leverages representation learning to extract geometric features from a specific building stock. Built upon VQ-AE, MARL encodes building footprints and purifies geometric information into latent vectors constrained by multiple architectural downstream tasks. These tailored representations are proven valuable for further clustering and building energy modeling. The advantages of our algorithm are its adaptability with respect to the different building footprint sizes, the ability for automatic generation across multi-scale regions, and the preservation of geometric features across neighborhoods and local ecolo",

    "translated_abstract": "建筑原型是建筑库的代表性模型，在城市建筑能源建模中非常关键。目前广泛采用的建筑原型是在全国范围内开发的，可能忽视了当地建筑物几何特性的影响。我们提出了一种称为多尺度原型表示学习（MARL）的方法，它利用表示学习从特定的建筑库中提取几何特征。MARL建立在VQ-AE上，将建筑物的轮廓编码，并将几何信息纯化为由多个建筑学上游任务约束的潜在向量。这些定制的表示对进一步的聚类和建筑能源建模非常有价值。我们算法的优点是它能够适应不同的建筑物轮廓尺寸，能够在多尺度区域自动生成，并能保持邻域和本地生态系统的几何特征。",
