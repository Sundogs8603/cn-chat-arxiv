    "translated_abstract": "鉴于技术指标对股市预测的影响，特征选择对选择最佳指标至关重要。一种考虑在特征选择过程中模型性能的特征选择方法是包装器特征选择方法。本研究旨在通过特征选择鉴定出最少误差的预测股市价格的最佳股市指标组合。为评估包装器特征选择技术对股市预测的影响，本文在过去10年苹果公司的数据上使用了10个评估器和123个技术指标进行了SFS和SBS的考察。此外，通过提出的方法，将由3天时间窗口创建的数据转化为适用于回归方法的输入。从观察结果可以得出：（1）每种包装器特征选择方法在不同的机器学习方法中具有不同的结果，每种方法在不同的预测准确性上也有所不同。",
