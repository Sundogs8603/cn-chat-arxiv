    "translated_abstract": "跨网络找到节点对应关系，即多网络对齐，是在多个网络上进行联合学习的基本先决条件。尽管在两个网络上对齐方面取得了巨大的成功，但是由于解空间指数增长和高阶差异度量缺乏，多网络对齐的文献有限。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了一种层次化多边汇运输框架（HOT）用于多网络对齐。为了处理庞大的解空间，多个网络通过融合的Gromov-Wasserstein（FGW）重心被分解为较小的对齐簇。为了描绘多个网络之间的高阶关系，FGW距离被推广到多边汇环境，基于这个距离可以实现网络的联合对齐。进一步开发了一种快速的近端点方法，保证收敛到局部最优解。大量的实验证明，我们提出的HOT相对于统计方法取得了显著的改进。",
