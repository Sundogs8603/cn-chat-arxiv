    "translated_abstract": "最近，对大型语言模型（LLMs）之间的讨论和辩论引起了广泛关注，因为它们有潜力增强LLMs的推理能力。尽管自然语言由于LLMs的语言理解能力而成为明显的交流选择，但生成自然语言时需要进行的标记采样步骤可能存在信息丢失的潜在风险，因为它仅使用一个标记来代表模型在整个词汇表中的信念。在本文中，我们介绍了一种名为CIPHER（通过嵌入表示进行交流的网络模型协议）的通信机制来解决这个问题。具体来说，我们从LLMs中去除了标记采样步骤，让它们通过原始Transformer输出嵌入的期望来传达它们的信念。值得注意的是，通过偏离自然语言，CIPHER在不对模型权重进行任何修改的情况下，提供了编码更广泛信息的优势。",
