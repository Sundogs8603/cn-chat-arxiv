    "translated_abstract": "情感分析是一个成熟的自然语言处理任务，情感极性分类是其中最受欢迎和代表性的任务之一。然而，尽管预训练的语言模型在这个领域取得了成功，但它们往往无法捕捉到情感分析的更广泛的复杂性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新的任务，称为语言的情感和观点理解（SOUL）。SOUL通过两个子任务来评估情感理解：评论理解（RC）和解释生成（JG）。RC旨在通过评论文本验证关于主观信息的陈述，而JG要求模型为其情感预测提供解释。为了进行全面的评估，我们标注了一个新的数据集，包括来自3638条评论的15028个陈述。实验结果表明，SOUL对小型和大型语言模型来说都是一个具有挑战性的任务，性能差距可高达27%。",
