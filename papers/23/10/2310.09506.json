    "translated_abstract": "预计即将到来的6G系统将面临各种非静态任务的挑战。这给传统的媒介访问控制（MAC）协议带来了困扰，因为MAC协议是静态和预定义的。为了应对这个挑战，最近出现了数据驱动的MAC协议，可以根据特定任务定制信令消息。本文将这些数据驱动的MAC协议分为三个级别进行了新颖的分类：第1级MAC：使用多智能体深度强化学习（MADRL）构建的面向任务的神经协议；第2级MAC：通过将第1级MAC的输出转换为显式符号开发的神经网络导向的符号协议；第3级MAC：利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和生成模型的面向语言的语义协议。通过这种分类，我们旨在深入探讨每个级别的机遇和挑战，并探索它们的基础技术。从信息论和相关原理以及选定的案例中汲取经验，",
