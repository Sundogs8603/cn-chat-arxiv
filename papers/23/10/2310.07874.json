    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了一个有大量商品m出售给n个策略招标人的最大化收入卖方的问题，他们的估值是从高维未知的先验分布中独立抽取的。众所周知，这种情况下的最优甚至近似最优的机制很难表达或计算，而且即使找到了，通常也具有各种反直觉的特性。在本文中，根据Cai和Daskalakis最近提出的模型，我们考虑投标人的先验分布可以被一个主题模型很好地近似。我们设计了一个负责与投标人进行交互并输出其类型的低维近似的主动学习组件，以及一个负责为低维模型设计机制以适应前一组件的近似类型的机制设计组件。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一种通过主动学习和机制设计相结合的方法，在拍卖中处理大量商品和策略招标人的问题。通过使用主题模型来近似投标人的先验分布，并设计出相应的机制，以提高机制的稳定性和适应性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a combined approach of active learning and mechanism design to handle the problem of a revenue-maximizing seller with a large number of items and strategic bidders. By approximating bidders' prior distributions using a topic model and designing corresponding mechanisms, the stability and adaptability of the mechanisms are improved."
