    "translated_abstract": "准确的水文学理解和水循环预测对于解决水资源管理中的科学和社会挑战至关重要，特别是在人为气候变化的动态影响下。现有的评论主要关注机器学习在这个领域的发展，然而水文学和机器学习作为独立的范式存在明显的区别。在这里，我们介绍了以物理感知机器学习作为一种变革性方法，克服了这种认知障碍，并革新了这两个领域。具体来说，我们提出了一个综合的物理感知机器学习方法的评论，构建了一个结构化社区（PaML），将先前的物理知识或基于物理的建模与机器学习相结合。我们系统地从物理数据引导的机器学习、物理信息处理的机器学习、物理嵌入式机器学习和物理感知混合学习四个方面分析了这些PaML方法。PaML促进了机器学习辅助的假设推导。",
