    "abstract": "The Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) brought together for the first time in history nine autonomous racing teams competing at unprecedented speed and in head-to-head scenario, using independently developed software on open-wheel racecars. This paper presents the complete software architecture used by team TII EuroRacing (TII-ER), covering all the modules needed to avoid static obstacles, perform active overtakes and reach speeds above 75 m/s (270 km/h). In addition to the most common modules related to perception, planning, and control, we discuss the approaches used for vehicle dynamics modelling, simulation, telemetry, and safety. Overall results and the performance of each module are described, as well as the lessons learned during the first two events of the competition on oval tracks, where the team placed respectively second and third.",

    "translated_abstract": "Indy Autonomous Challenge（IAC）第一次将九个自主驾驶赛车团队聚集在一起，使用独立开发的软件，在公开轮式赛车上以前所未有的速度进行对抗比赛。本文介绍了由TII EuroRacing（TII-ER）团队使用的完整软件架构，包括避免静态障碍物、主动超车和达到每秒75米（270公里/小时）以上的速度所需的所有模块。除了与感知、规划和控制相关的最常见模块外，我们还讨论了车辆动力学建模、仿真、遥测和安全的方法。介绍了整体结果和每个模块的性能，以及在椭圆赛道上进行的前两场比赛中团队所获得的第二名和第三名的经验教训。",
    "tldr": "er.autopilot 1.0是TII EuroRacing团队开发的一款高速椭圆赛车完全自主驾驶系统，通过避免障碍、主动超车和达到高速等模块的应用，取得了在椭圆赛道比赛中的良好表现，并获得第二名和第三名的成绩。",
    "en_tdlr": "er.autopilot 1.0 is a full autonomous driving system for high-speed oval racing developed by the TII EuroRacing team. Its modules for obstacle avoidance, active overtaking, and high-speed operation enabled the team to achieve excellent performance and secure second and third places in oval track competitions."
