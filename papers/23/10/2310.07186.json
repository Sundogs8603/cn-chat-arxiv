    "translated_abstract": "对于高光谱图像(HSI)中的每个像素，识别其土地覆盖类别依赖于光谱和空间信息。利用具有特定块大小的HSI立方体来提取中心像素的空间-光谱特征表示。本文研究了HSI立方体中可能记录到的场景特定但非本质相关性。这些额外信息改善了现有HSI数据集上的模型性能，并使得对模型能力的恰当评估变得困难。我们将这个问题称为空间过拟合问题，并利用严格的实验设置来避免它。我们进一步提出了一种用于HSI分类的多视角Transformer，包括多视角主成分分析(MPCA)、光谱编码器-解码器(SED)和空间池化标记化Transformer(SPTT)。MPCA通过构建光谱多视角观测并对每个视角数据应用PCA进行降维来对HSI进行降维处理。",
