    "abstract": "Given the marginal distribution information of the underlying asset price at two future times $T_1$ and $T_2$, we consider the problem of determining a model-free upper bound on the price of a class of American options that must be exercised at either $T_1$ or $T_2$. The model uncertainty consistent with the given marginal information is described as the martingale optimal transport problem. We show that if the American option payoff satisfies a suitable convexity condition, then any option exercise scheme associated with any market model that jointly maximizes the expected option payoff must be nonrandomized.",
