    "translated_abstract": "由于在数据采集和模型训练过程中需要付出巨大的努力，深度神经网络（DNN）属于模型创建者的知识产权。因此，未经授权的使用、盗窃或修改可能导致法律后果。现有的DNN水印方法往往非直观，嵌入人眼不可见的标记，需要对缺乏人可理解属性的算法评估产生信任，并且依赖于刚性的阈值，易受到部分水印擦除的影响。本文介绍了ClearMark，这是第一种为直观人类评估而设计的DNN水印方法。ClearMark嵌入可见水印，使人类可以进行决策，而无需刚性的值阈值，同时允许技术辅助评估。ClearMark定义了一个转置模型架构，可以将水印与所有模型参数中的主要任务交织在一起。与现有的水印方法相比，",
