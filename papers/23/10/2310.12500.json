    "translated_abstract": "期权作为一种关键的金融工具，在证券市场中被投资者用来管理和减轻投资风险。精确预测期权的现价使投资者能够做出明智和高效的决策。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于门控循环单元（GRU）和自注意机制的机器学习方法，用于预测SPY（ETF）期权的价格。我们首先根据货币价值和到期日的标准将原始数据集分成15个子集。对于每个子集，我们匹配相应的美国政府债券利率和隐含波动率指数。这种分割方式可以更深入地探索无风险利率和基础波动率对期权定价的影响。接下来，我们构建了四个不同的机器学习模型，包括多层感知机（MLP）、长短期记忆（LSTM）、自注意LSTM和自注意GRU，与传统的二项模型进行比较。",
