    "abstract": "The amount of news being consumed online has substantially expanded in recent years. Fake news has become increasingly common, especially in regional languages like Malayalam, due to the rapid publication and lack of editorial standards on some online sites. Fake news may have a terrible effect on society, causing people to make bad judgments, lose faith in authorities, and even engage in violent behavior. When we take into the context of India, there are many regional languages, and fake news is spreading in every language. Therefore, providing efficient techniques for identifying false information in regional tongues is crucial. Until now, little to no work has been done in Malayalam, extracting features from multiple modalities to classify fake news. Multimodal approaches are more accurate in detecting fake news, as features from multiple modalities are extracted to build the deep learning classification model. As far as we know, this is the first piece of work in Malayalam that use",

    "translated_abstract": "在线新闻的消费量近年来大幅增加。由于某些网站的快速发布和缺乏编辑标准，假新闻在地方语言如马拉雅拉姆语中越来越普遍。假新闻可能对社会产生可怕的影响，导致人们做出错误判断，对权威失去信任，甚至参与暴力行为。在印度的语境下，有很多地方语言，假新闻在每种语言中都在传播。因此，提供有效的技术来识别地方语言中的假信息至关重要。迄今为止，在马拉雅拉姆语中，几乎没有关于提取多模态特征来分类假新闻的工作。多模态方法在检测假新闻方面更准确，因为从多种模态中提取特征构建深度学习分类模型。据我们所知，这是首次在马拉雅拉姆语中使用多模态特征来识别假新闻的工作。",
