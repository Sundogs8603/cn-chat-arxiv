    "translated_abstract": "磁共振成像（MRI）在医学诊断中起着重要作用，每年在大型医院产生了数PB的图像数据。这个庞大的数据流需要大量的网络带宽和庞大的存储基础设施。此外，本地数据处理需要大量的人力和硬件投资。不同医疗机构之间的数据隔离阻碍了临床和研究的跨机构合作。在这项工作中，我们预期将新兴的分布式云计算、6G带宽、边缘计算、联邦学习和区块链技术结合起来，提出一种创新的MRI系统及其四代。该系统被称为Cloud-MRI，旨在解决MRI数据存储安全性、传输速度、AI算法维护、硬件升级和协作工作的问题。工作流程从将k空间原始数据转化为标准化的磁共振成像学会的图像格式开始。",
