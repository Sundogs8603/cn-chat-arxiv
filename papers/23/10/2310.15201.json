    "translated_abstract": "皮肤微生物组在维持健康皮肤方面起着重要作用。它是一个由多个物种组成的生态系统，竞争资源并与皮肤细胞相互作用。皮肤微生物组的不平衡，也称为菌群紊乱，与多种皮肤状况（包括痤疮和特应性皮炎）相关。通常，菌群紊乱与皮肤被机会性致病菌群的定居有关。以非特异性消除皮肤微生物组的治疗结果相互矛盾。在本文中，我们引入了一种基于常微分方程的数学模型，其中包括2种类型的细菌群落（皮肤共生菌和机会性致病菌）以及抗微生物肽的产生，以研究驱动一种群落优势于另一种群落的机制。通过使用出版的实验数据，假设这些数据对应于我们模型中的稳定状态的观察，我们减少了数量。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a mathematical model based on ordinary differential equations to investigate the interaction between two bacterial populations (commensal and opportunistic pathogens) in the skin microbiome, taking into account the production of antimicrobial peptides. Validating the stable states of the model using experimental data helps us understand the competition mechanism and stability among different populations in the skin microbiome."
