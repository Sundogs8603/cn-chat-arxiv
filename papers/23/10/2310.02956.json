    "abstract": "The use of credit cards has recently increased, creating an essential need for credit card assessment methods to minimize potential risks. This study investigates the utilization of machine learning (ML) models for credit card default prediction system. The main goal here is to investigate the best-performing ML model for new proposed credit card scoring dataset. This new dataset includes credit card transaction histories and customer profiles, is proposed and tested using a variety of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, multi layer perceptron (MLP) neural network, XGBoost, and LightGBM. To prepare the data for machine learning models, we perform data pre-proccessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and data balancing techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that MLP outperforms logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, LightGBM, and XGBoost in terms of predictive performance in true positive rate, achieving ",
