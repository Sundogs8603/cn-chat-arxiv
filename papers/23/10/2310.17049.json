    "abstract": "A good supervised embedding for a specific machine learning task is only sensitive to changes in the label of interest and is invariant to other confounding factors. We leverage the concept of repeatability from measurement theory to describe this property and propose to use the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to evaluate the repeatability of embeddings. We then propose a novel regularizer, the ICC regularizer, as a complementary component for contrastive losses to guide deep neural networks to produce embeddings with higher repeatability. We use simulated data to explain why the ICC regularizer works better on minimizing the intra-class variance than the contrastive loss alone. We implement the ICC regularizer and apply it to three speech tasks: speaker verification, voice style conversion, and a clinical application for detecting dysphonic voice. The experimental results demonstrate that adding an ICC regularizer can improve the repeatability of learned embeddings compared ",

    "translated_abstract": "一个好的监督嵌入用于特定的机器学习任务，仅对感兴趣的标签的变化敏感，并且对其他混淆因素不变。我们利用测量理论中的重复性概念来描述这个属性，并提出使用类内相关系数（ICC）来评估嵌入的重复性。然后，我们提出了一种新的正则化器，即ICC正则化器，作为对比损失的补充组件，引导深度神经网络生成具有更高重复性的嵌入。我们使用模拟数据来解释为什么ICC正则化器在减小类内变异性方面比仅使用对比损失更有效。我们实现了ICC正则化器，并将其应用于三个语音任务：说话人验证、语音风格转换以及用于检测声带功能紊乱的临床应用。实验结果表明，添加ICC正则化器可以提高学习到的嵌入的重复性。",
