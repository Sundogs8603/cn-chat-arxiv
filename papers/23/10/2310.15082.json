    "translated_abstract": "最近，神经元动力学中的时间不可逆性被证明与活体系统中的认知努力指标有关。利用兰道尔原理，该原理认为时间不可逆的信息处理会消耗能量，我们建立了一种与信念动力学相关的热力学一致的认知能量成本度量标准。我们利用这个概念分析了一个标准的不确定决策框架下的两臂赌博游戏，考虑了利用、有限记忆和同时分配给两个游戏选项或臂的情况。通过基于利用和预测误差的信念动力学，决策者产生了认知能量消耗。首先，我们观察到在中间的利用水平下，信念空间的稳态中形成了耗散结构，这是由于时间反转对称性的破坏。为了更深入地了解信念动力学，我们把它比作受状态相关噪声作用的主动粒子的行为。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the energy cost of cognitive decisions and establishes a thermodynamically consistent measure to quantify it. The study finds that the utilization and prediction error lead to cognitive energy consumption and the formation of dissipative structures in the steady state. By analogizing belief dynamics to the behavior of an active particle subjected to state-dependent noise, the dynamic characteristics of cognitive energy cost are further analyzed."
