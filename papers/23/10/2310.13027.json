    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯神经网络(BNNs)已成为不确定性评估的有希望方法之一，由于其坚实的理论基础。然而，BNNs的性能受到捕捉不确定性的能力的影响。本文提出了一种新的附加结构贝叶斯神经网络(ABNN)，通过附加结构从足够分布外的数据(OOD)中捕捉更多的不确定性。我们首先根据先验分布为OOD数据的不确定性构建了一个数学描述，然后开发了一个附加的贝叶斯结构将OOD数据的不确定性整合到主干网络中。ABNN由期望模块和若干分布模块组成。期望模块是一个专注于原始任务的主干深度网络，而分布模块则是作为主干的附加结构的小贝叶斯结构。特别地，这些分布模块的目的是检测和传播OOD数据的不确定性，从而提高整体网络的贝叶斯性质。",
