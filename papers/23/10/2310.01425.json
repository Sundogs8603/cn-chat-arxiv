    "translated_abstract": "许多人认为大型语言模型（LLMs）开启了人工智能（AI）时代。一些人看到了机遇，而其他人则看到了危险。然而，支持者和反对者都通过科幻小说中流行的意象来理解AI。机器是否会变得有感知能力并反抗其创造者？我们是否会经历纸夹夹子启示？在回答这些问题之前，我们首先应该问一下，这种心理意象是否对手头的现象提供了良好的描述。仅通过神灵的情绪来理解天气模式的方法是有限的。相反，本文主张通过乔治·路易斯·博尔赫斯的意象来理解LLMs及其与AI的关系，博尔赫斯是20世纪文学大师，魔幻现实主义先驱和后现代文学的前奏。这种探索方式带来了新的视角，阐明了语言模型与人工智能之间的关系。",
