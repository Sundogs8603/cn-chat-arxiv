    "translated_abstract": "在揭示测试时的新类别的探索中，我们面临着传统有监督识别模型的固有限制，这些模型受到预定义类别集的限制。虽然在自我监督和开放式学习领域取得了一定进展，以实现测试时的类别发现，但一个关键但常常被忽视的问题仍然存在：什么确切地界定了一个类别？在本文中，我们通过优化的视角概念化类别，将其视为一个明确定义问题的最优解。利用这种独特的概念化，我们提出了一种新颖、高效和自我监督的方法，能够在测试时发现以前未知的类别。我们方法的一个显著特点是将最小长度类别代码分配给单个数据实例，这样可以概括真实世界数据集中普遍存在的隐含类别层次结构。这种机制使我们能够更好地控制类别的细粒度，从而为我们的模型提供了增强的能力。",
