    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种创新的方法，利用EOG信号进行自动化的睡眠阶段分类，解决了EEG数据采集带来的不适和不实用性问题。此外，值得注意的是，这种方法在领域中尚未被开发，突显了其对新见解和贡献的潜力。我们提出的SE-Resnet-Transformer模型能够从原始EOG信号准确分类出五个不同的睡眠阶段。对公开可用的数据库（SleepEDF-20、SleepEDF-78和SHHS）进行了广泛验证，显示出显著的性能，分别为74.72、70.63和69.26的宏F1分数。我们的模型在识别REM睡眠方面表现出色，这是睡眠障碍研究的关键方面。我们还使用1D-GradCAM和t-SNE图等技术对我们模型的内部机制进行了分析。我们的方法改进了睡眠阶段分类的可访问性，同时减少了对EEG设备的需求。这一发展具有前景。",
