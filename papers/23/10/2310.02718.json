    "translated_abstract": "全色增强算法利用全色图像和多光谱图像获取具有高空间和高光谱的图像。然而，这些算法的优化是根据不同的标准设计的。我们采用简单的矩阵方程来描述全色增强问题，并讨论解的存在条件以及光谱和空间分辨率的获取。我们引入了一种降采样增强方法，以更好地获取空间和光谱降采样矩阵。通过广义逆理论，我们推导出了两种形式的广义逆矩阵表达式，可以对应于两个主要的全色增强方法：分量替代和多分辨率分析方法。具体而言，我们证明了Gram Schmidt自适应(GSA)方法遵循分量替代的广义逆矩阵表达式。我们提出了一个在光谱函数的广义逆矩阵之前的模型先验。我们对理论误差进行了分析。",
