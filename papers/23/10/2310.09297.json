    "translated_abstract": "人类和机器如何将当前的输入与过去的记忆结合起来，进行关联推理和问答，并将感知到的信息置于上下文中，这是认知科学和人工智能中的一个具有挑战性的谜题。受到人脑记忆系统和认知结构的启发，我们提出了一个包含感知、记忆和推理组件的PMI框架。特别地，记忆模块包括工作记忆和长期记忆，其中后者具有更高阶的结构来保留更多的累积知识和经验。通过可区分的竞争写入访问，当前的感知更新工作记忆，之后通过外积关联与长期记忆融合，避免内存溢出并最小化信息冲突。在推理模块中，相关信息从两个单独的记忆源检索并结合，以获得更全面和精确的解释。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a neural module inspired by human memory mechanisms, which simulates how humans and machines perform relational reasoning and question-answering by combining current inputs with past memories. Through perception, memory, and inference components, the module achieves functions of perception update, memory merging, and information retrieval."
