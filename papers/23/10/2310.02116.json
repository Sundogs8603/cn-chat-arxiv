    "translated_abstract": "最近，深度学习算法因其卓越的性能而引起了大量关注。然而，它们的高复杂性和不可解释的操作方式阻碍了它们在真实世界的安全关键任务中的自信部署。本研究针对的是ante hoc可解释性，具体 说是概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）。我们的目标是设计一个框架，以多个层次粒度上的人类可理解概念为基础，实现高度可解释的决策过程。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的分层概念发现方法，利用：（i）图像文本模型的最新进展，以及（ii）基于数据驱动和稀疏诱导的贝叶斯参数进行多层概念选择的创新公式。在这个框架中，概念信息不仅仅依赖于整体图像与一般非结构化概念之间的相似性；相反，我们引入了概念层次的概念，以揭示和利用更多的细节。",
