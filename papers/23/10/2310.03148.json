    "abstract": "Various data imbalances that naturally arise in a multi-territory personalized recommender system can lead to a significant item bias for globally prevalent items. A locally popular item can be overshadowed by a globally prevalent item.

In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) technique, along with an adaptive upsampling method to reduce popularity bias in multi-territory recommendations. Our proposed framework is designed to enrich training examples with active users representation through upsampling, and capable of learning geographic-based user embeddings by leveraging MTL.

    "translated_abstract": "多领域个性化推荐系统中自然产生的各种数据不平衡可能导致全球流行物品的显著项目偏见。局部流行项目可能会被全球流行项目所掩盖。此外，用户的观看模式/统计数据在不同地理位置之间可能发生剧变，这可能表明需要学习特定的用户嵌入。本文提出了一种多任务学习（MTL）技术，以及一种自适应上采样方法，用于减少多领域推荐中的流行偏见。我们的框架通过上采样来丰富含有活跃用户表示的训练样本，并借助MTL来学习基于地理位置的用户嵌入。通过实验证明，与不采用我们提出的技术的基准相比，我们的框架在多个领域的效果显著。值得注意的是，我们在PR-AUC指标上显示出了高达65.27%的相对增益。",
