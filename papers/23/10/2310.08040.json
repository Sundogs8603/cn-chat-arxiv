    "abstract": "Current techniques for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection predominantly rely on quantifying predictive uncertainty and incorporating model regularization during the training phase, using either real or synthetic OoD samples. However, methods that utilize real OoD samples lack exploration and are prone to overfit the OoD samples at hand. Whereas synthetic samples are often generated based on features extracted from training data, rendering them less effective when the training and OoD data are highly overlapped in the feature space. In this work, we propose a Wasserstein-score-based generative adversarial training scheme to enhance OoD detection accuracy, which, for the first time, performs data augmentation and exploration simultaneously under the supervision of limited OoD samples. Specifically, the generator explores OoD spaces and generates synthetic OoD samples using feedback from the discriminator, while the discriminator exploits both the observed and synthesized samples for OoD",

    "translated_abstract": "当前的离域检测技术主要依赖于量化预测不确定性并在训练阶段通过模型正则化来使用真实或合成的离域样本。然而，利用真实离域样本的方法缺乏探索，容易过拟合手头的离域样本。而合成样本通常是基于从训练数据中提取的特征生成的，当训练数据和离域数据在特征空间中高度重叠时，它们的效果较差。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于Wasserstein分数的生成对抗训练方案，以提高离域检测的准确性，这是首次在有限离域样本的监督下同时进行数据增强和探索。具体而言，生成器利用鉴别器的反馈来探索离域空间并生成合成的离域样本，而鉴别器则利用观察到的和合成的样本来进行离域检测。",
