    "abstract": "We consider the problem of locating a facility to serve a set of agents located along a line. The Nash welfare objective function, defined as the product of the agents' utilities, is known to provide a compromise between fairness and efficiency in resource allocation problems. We apply this welfare notion to the facility location problem, converting individual costs to utilities and analyzing the facility placement that maximizes the Nash welfare. We give a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to compute this facility location, and prove results suggesting that it achieves a good balance of fairness and efficiency. Finally, we take a mechanism design perspective and propose a strategy-proof mechanism with a bounded approximation ratio for Nash welfare.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在一条线上为一组代理人确定位置的问题。纳什福利目标函数，定义为代理人效用的乘积，在资源分配问题中已知提供了公平性和效率性之间的折中。我们将这种福利概念应用于设施位置问题，将个体成本转化为效用，并分析最大化纳什福利的设施位置。我们给出了一个多项式时间近似算法来计算这个设施位置，并证明了结果表明它达到了公平性和效率性的良好平衡。最后，我们从机制设计的角度出发，提出了一个策略证明机制，其纳什福利的近似比例有界。",
