Despite extensive studies in the last decades, many challenges still exist, particularly in pattern-based methods. Existing pattern-based methods measure the discriminative power of each feature individually during the mining process, leading to the result of missing some combinations of features with discriminative power. Furthermore, it is difficult to ensure the overall discriminative performance after converting sequences into feature vectors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Hamming Encoder, which utilizes a binarized 1D-convolutional neural network (1DCNN) architecture to mine discriminative k-mer sets. In particular, we adopt a Hamming distance-based similarity measure to ensure consistency in the feature mining and classification procedure. Our method involves training an interpretable CNN encoder for sequential data and performing a gradient-based search for discriminative k-mer",

    "translated_abstract": "序列分类在各个领域中都有很多应用。尽管过去几十年进行了大量的研究，但仍然存在许多挑战，特别是在基于模式的方法中。现有的基于模式的方法在挖掘过程中单独衡量每个特征的区分能力，导致遗漏了一些具有区分能力的特征组合。此外，在将序列转换为特征向量后，很难确保整体的区分性能。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新的方法，称为Hamming编码器，它利用二进制的1D卷积神经网络（1DCNN）结构来挖掘区分性k-mer集。特别地，我们采用基于Hamming距离的相似度度量来确保特征挖掘和分类过程的一致性。我们的方法涉及训练一个可解释的CNN编码器来处理顺序数据，并通过梯度搜索来寻找区分性k-mer。",
