    "abstract": "A proper evaluation of stories generated for a sequence of images -- the task commonly referred to as visual storytelling -- must consider multiple aspects, such as coherence, grammatical correctness, and visual grounding. In this work, we focus on evaluating the degree of grounding, that is, the extent to which a story is about the entities shown in the images. We analyze current metrics, both designed for this purpose and for general vision-text alignment. Given their observed shortcomings, we propose a novel evaluation tool, GROOViST, that accounts for cross-modal dependencies, temporal misalignments (the fact that the order in which entities appear in the story and the image sequence may not match), and human intuitions on visual grounding. An additional advantage of GROOViST is its modular design, where the contribution of each component can be assessed and interpreted individually.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于一个由一系列图像生成的故事的适当评估，必须考虑多个方面，例如连贯性，语法正确性和视觉定位。在这项工作中，我们专注于评估定位程度，即故事与图像中显示的实体相关程度。我们分析了当前的评估指标，包括针对此目的设计的指标和针对一般视觉-文本对齐的指标。鉴于它们存在的缺点，我们提出了一种新的评估工具GROOViST，该工具考虑了跨模态依赖，时间错位（故事中实体出现的顺序和图像序列可能不匹配）以及人类对视觉定位的直觉。GROOViST的另一个优点是其模块化设计，可以对每个组件的贡献进行评估和解释。",
