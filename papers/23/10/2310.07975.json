    "translated_abstract": "从RGB图像中自动化地分类枪支是一项重要的现实任务，其应用范围涉及公共空间安全、情报收集和执法调查。当应用于从全球范围内大规模抓取的图像（包括社交媒体和暗网站）时，它可以作为分析开放源情报中的大数据的系统的重要组成部分，以试图识别犯罪枪支走私网络。深度神经网络（DNN）是实现这一目标的最先进方法，其中通常使用卷积神经网络（CNN）。常见的迁移学习方法包括在大规模的通用注释数据集（如ImageNet-1k）上进行预训练进行整体图像分类，然后在较小的、注释的、任务特定的下游数据集上对DNN进行微调以进行枪支视觉分类。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种自监督视觉学习方法，用于分析网络上的枪支走私活动。这种方法利用深度神经网络和卷积神经网络，通过从大规模通用数据集预训练，再在特定数据集上进行微调，实现对枪支的分类。"
