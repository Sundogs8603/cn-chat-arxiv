    "abstract": "We present a deep learning model to automatically generate computer models of the human heart from patient imaging data with an emphasis on its capability to generate thin-walled cardiac structures. Our method works by deforming a template mesh to fit the cardiac structures to the given image. Compared with prior deep learning methods that adopted this approach, our framework is designed to minimize mesh self-penetration, which typically arises when deforming surface meshes separated by small distances. We achieve this by using a two-stage diffeomorphic deformation process along with a novel loss function derived from the kinematics of motion that penalizes surface contact and interpenetration. Our model demonstrates comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods while additionally producing meshes free of self-intersections. The resultant meshes are readily usable in physics based simulation, minimizing the need for post-processing and cleanup.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种深度学习模型，可以从患者成像数据中自动生成人类心脏的计算机模型，并且特别强调其能够生成薄壁心脏结构。我们的方法通过将一个模板网格形变到给定图像的心脏结构上。与以前采用这种方法的深度学习方法相比，我们的框架旨在最小化网格自穿透，这通常发生在形变的表面网格之间的小距离。我们通过使用两阶段的形变过程和一种基于运动动力学导出的新型损失函数来实现这一点，该损失函数惩罚表面接触和相互渗透。我们的模型在与最先进方法相比的同时，还能产生不自相交的网格。产生的网格在基于物理的模拟中可直接使用，最大限度地减少了后处理和清理的需求。",
