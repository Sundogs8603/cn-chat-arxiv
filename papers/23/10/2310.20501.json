    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现在信息检索（IR）应用，尤其是在网络搜索方面，彻底改变了范式。由于其在生成类人文本方面的卓越能力，LLMs在互联网上创造了大量的文本。因此，LLMs时代的IR系统面临一个新的挑战：索引的文档不仅是由人类撰写的，而且还包括由LLMs自动生成的文档。这些LLM生成的文档如何影响IR系统是一个紧迫且尚未探索的问题。在这项工作中，我们在涉及人类编写和LLM生成的文本的不同IR模型的场景中进行了定量评估。令人惊讶的是，我们的研究结果表明，神经检索模型倾向于将LLM生成的文档排名较高。我们将这种神经检索模型对LLM生成文本的偏见称为“来源偏见”。此外，我们发现这种偏见不仅限于f方相当的情况，而且在分类任务上也存在。",
