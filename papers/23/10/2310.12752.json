Unfortunately, the goal of the existing methods is not to find a discrete solution that minimizes the original objective. In other words, the primary drawback is the neglect of the original objective when computing the discrete solution. Inspired by the first-order optimization algorithms, we propose to develop a first-order term to bridge the original problem and discretization algorithm, which is the first non-heuristic to the best of our knowledge. Since the non-heuristic method is aware of the original graph cut problem, the final discrete solution is more reliable and achieves the preferable loss value.

    "translated_abstract": "谱聚类及其扩展通常包括两个步骤：（1）构建图并计算松弛解；（2）离散化松弛解。尽管前者已经得到广泛研究，但离散化技术主要是启发式方法，如k-means，谱旋转。不幸的是，现有方法的目标并非寻找使原始目标函数最小化的离散解。换句话说，主要缺点是在计算离散解时忽略了原始目标。受一阶优化算法的启发，我们提出了开发第一阶项来连接原始问题和离散化算法的方法，据我们所知这是非启发式方法中的首个。由于非启发式方法意识到了原始图割问题，最终离散解的可靠性更高，可以达到较好的损失值。我们还从理论上证明了连续最优解的优势。",
