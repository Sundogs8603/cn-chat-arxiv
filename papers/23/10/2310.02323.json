    "translated_abstract": "量子神经网络（QNNs）被认为是一种可以在噪声存在的情况下在近期量子硬件上低深度高效模拟的量子算法之一。然而，它们的性能高度依赖于选择最合适的变分量子算法（VQAs）架构，问题无关的模型通常遇到可训练性和泛化能力的问题。作为解决方案，最近的研究探索了几何量子机器学习（GQML），使用了与给定数据集的底层对称性等变的QNNs。GQML通过将先验知识纳入到模型中来为模型添加归纳偏差，并在约束搜索空间的同时提高了优化性能。本文提出了针对平面$p4m$对称性的图像分类的等变量子卷积神经网络（EquivQCNNs）。我们展示了在不同数据集测试的结果。",
