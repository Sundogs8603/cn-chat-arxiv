    "translated_abstract": "本文对经济与金融理论进行了根本性改革，包括电子货币在内。电子货币的估值将基于宏观经济理论和货币政策的基本方程，而不是微观经济学中的贴现现金流理论。与将股票视为与次经济体的无形资产关联的所有权不同，我们将发展电子货币作为与次经济体有形资产关联的交易权益的观点。我们还将发展电子货币管理公司作为一个负责协调次经济体的货币（电子货币供应和价值稳定）和财政（投资和运营）政策的实体的视角，以实现电子货币的流动性。在估值和决策中使用的风险模型不会是无处不在但不合适的指数风险模型，它将导致贴现率，而是多时间尺度的模型。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文通过根本性的改革，将电子货币纳入经济与金融理论，提出了一种新的理论框架，包括电子货币的估值基于宏观经济理论和货币政策的基本方程，以及电子货币管理公司作为协调次经济体货币和财政政策的实体。该研究避免使用普遍但不适当的指数风险模型，而是采用多时间尺度的模型。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a new economic and financial theory that includes electronic currencies, reformulating the valuation approach and introducing the concept of electronic currency management as a coordination entity for monetary and fiscal policies. The study also proposes the use of a multi time scale risk model instead of the ubiquitous exponential risk model for valuations and decision-making."
