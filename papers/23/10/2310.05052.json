    "translated_abstract": "电池寿命预测对电池研究和开发具有重要的实际价值。目前，许多数据驱动模型依赖于特定目标电池的早期电信号来预测它们的寿命。一个常见的不足是，大多数现有方法都是基于特定老化条件开发的，这不仅限制了它们的模型能力，而且降低了它们在预测不同条件下的退化效果。因此，这些模型通常无法充分利用其他条件下可用的丰富历史数据。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种方法，明确捕捉目标电池和参考电池之间的电信号差异，无论它们的材料和老化条件如何，来预测目标电池的寿命。通过这种细胞间差异，我们不仅扩展了特征空间，还为通用的电池寿命预测框架铺平了道路。显著的是，我们的方法能够在不同条件下精确预测电池寿命。",
