    "translated_abstract": "引用是科学家们用来表示之前知识的机制，但最近已经变成了广泛使用和滥用的科学影响力的度量标准。然而，当一个发现变成共识时，引用会因为被忽视而被合并。这导致了隐藏引用的概念，它表示对一个发现的明确文本认可，但没有引用该发现的出版物。在这里，我们依赖于无监督可解释机器学习应用于每篇论文的全文，以系统地识别隐藏引用。我们发现，对于有影响力的发现，隐藏引用数量超过了引用计数，而且不受出版场所和学科的限制。我们展示了隐藏引用的普遍性不是由引用计数驱动的，而是由于手稿文本中对话题的讨论程度决定的，这表明一个发现被讨论得越多，它在标准的引文分析中就越不可见。隐藏引用指示了...",
    "tldr": "隐藏引用现象在科学中普遍存在，并且超过了正式引用的数量，表明传统的引文分析方法无法准确评估科学发现的影响力。"
