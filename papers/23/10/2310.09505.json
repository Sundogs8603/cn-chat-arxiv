    "translated_abstract": "测试时间自适应（TTA）是在推理过程中解决分布转换问题的关键方法，特别是在视觉识别任务中。然而，虽然声学模型在测试时间的语音分布转换中面临相似的挑战，但针对声学建模在开放世界数据转换环境下的TTA技术仍然很少见。考虑到声学基础模型的特点：1）它们主要是基于具有层归一化的变压器架构构建的；2）它们以一种非静态的方式处理长度不同的测试时间语音数据。这些因素使得在视觉聚焦的TTA方法的直接应用变得不可行，这些方法大多依赖于批归一化并假设独立样本。在本文中，我们深入研究了面临开放世界数据转换的预训练声学模型的TTA方法。我们发现，噪声较大、熵较高的语音帧通常带有关键的语义内容。传统的视觉TTA方法的直接应用在声学建模中并不可行。",
