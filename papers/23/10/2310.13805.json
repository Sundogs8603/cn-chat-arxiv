Interferometric Synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data is important in providing high-resolution onsite information for rapid hazard estimation. Most recent methods using InSAR imagery signals predict a single type of hazard and thus often suffer low accuracy due to noisy and complex signals induced by co-located hazards, impacts, and irrelevant environmental changes (e.g., vegetation changes, human activities). We introduce a novel stochastic variational inference with normalizing flows derived to jointly approximate posteriors of multiple unobserved hazards and impacts from noisy InSAR imagery.",

    "translated_abstract": "现场灾害如地震可能引发级联灾害和影响，例如滑坡和基础设施损坏，导致灾难性损失；因此，及时和准确的估计对于灾后应急反应至关重要。干涉合成孔径雷达（InSAR）数据在提供高分辨率现场信息以进行快速灾害估计方面是至关重要的。最近利用InSAR图像信号的方法通常预测单一类型的灾害，因此经常由于由同地点的多种灾害、影响和无关的环境变化（例如植被变化、人类活动）引起的嘈杂和复杂信号而准确性较低。我们引入了一种新颖的随机变分推断，利用正规化流联合逼近从嘈杂的InSAR图像中多个未观测的灾害和影响的后验。",
