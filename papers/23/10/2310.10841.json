    "translated_abstract": "自动化事件检测已经成为通过传感器数据监控技术系统行为的基本实践之一。在汽车行业中，这些方法在追踪时间序列数据中的事件方面需求量很大。为了评估主动车辆安全系统，进行了各种各样的驾驶场景。这些场景涉及使用外部传感器记录车辆行为，以评估实际性能。在这种情况下，自动化检测方法不仅加快了评估速度，还通过避免数据检查中主观的、基于人的评价来标准化和客观化评估。本研究提出了一种新的事件检测方法，可以在时间序列数据中识别基于频率的事件。为此，时间序列数据被映射到时间-频率域中的表示，即scalogram。在过滤scalogram以增强信号的相关部分之后，使用目标检测模型检测事件。",
