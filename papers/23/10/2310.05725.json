    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了一个在群体公平性约束下的二元分类问题，该问题可以是人口统计学公平性（DP），机会均等（EOp）或等概率（EO）之一。我们提出了在公平性约束下贝叶斯最优分类器的明确特征化，结果是不受约束分类器的简单修改规则。即，我们引入了一种新的实例级别的偏差度量，称为偏差分数，而修改规则则是在有限量的偏差分数之上的简单线性规则。基于这个特征化，我们开发了一种后验方法，使我们能够适应公平性约束同时保持较高的准确性。在DP和EOp约束的情况下，修改规则是基于单个偏差分数的阈值选择，而在EO约束的情况下，我们需要调整具有2个参数的线性修改规则。该方法还可以用于包含多个敏感属性的复合群体公平性标准的情况。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一种后验偏差评分的方法，在满足公平性约束的情况下保持高准确性，并给出了基于偏差分数的修改规则。该方法适用于各种类型的公平性约束问题。"
