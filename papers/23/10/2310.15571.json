    "translated_abstract": "在视觉世界中行动的人工智能代理的一个理想特性是在平衡每项任务的充分专业化和构建一般化知识以进行传递的同时，持续学习一系列语言驱动的任务。选择性专业化，即在每个任务中精心选择模型组件进行专业化，是控制这种权衡的策略。然而，设计选择策略需要对每个模型组件在学习较为专业化或可普遍化表示中的作用有深入的了解，而当前研究存在这方面的差距。因此，我们的目标是对可视化基础的持续语言学习的选择策略进行广泛的分析。由于缺乏适用于此目的的合适基准，我们引入了两个新的诊断数据集，提供了足够的控制和灵活性进行彻底的模型分析。我们评估了各种启发式的模块专业化策略以及...",
