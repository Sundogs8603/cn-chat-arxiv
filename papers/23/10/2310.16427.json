Existing prompt optimization methods tend to overlook the depth of domain knowledge and struggle to efficiently explore the vast space of expert-level prompts. Addressing this, we present PromptAgent, an optimization method that autonomously crafts prompts equivalent in quality to those handcrafted by experts. At its core, PromptAgent views prompt optimization as a strategic planning problem and employs a principled planning algorithm, rooted in Monte Carlo tree search, to strategically navigate the expert-level prompt space.

    "translated_abstract": "高效、任务特定的提示通常需要经过专家的精心设计，需要结合详细的指导和领域见解，基于对大型语言模型和目标任务细节的深入理解。然而，自动化生成专家级提示的方法仍然难以实现。现有的提示优化方法往往忽视领域知识的深度，并且难以高效地探索专家级提示的广阔空间。为解决这个问题，我们提出了PromptAgent，这是一种自主设计与专家手工打造的提示相当的优化方法。PromptAgent将提示优化视为一个战略规划问题，并采用一种根据Monte Carlo树搜索的规则计算算法在专家级提示空间中进行有效导航。PromptAgent通过类人类的反复试错探索，引发精确的专家级见解和深入的指令。",
