    "translated_abstract": "在图上进行节点分类是一个具有许多应用的重要研究问题。现实世界中的图数据集可能并不如大多数现有工作所假定的那样平衡和准确。正-未标记（PU）节点分类是一个具有挑战性的设置，其中标记节点被限制为正节点。它具有多样的应用，例如疫情预测或网络异常检测。现有的PU节点分类工作忽视了图结构中的信息，而这可能是关键的。在本文中，我们提出了更好地利用图结构进行PU节点分类的方法。我们首先提出了一个距离感知的PU损失，利用图中的同质性引入更准确的监督。我们还提出了一个正则化项，使模型与图结构对齐。理论分析表明，最小化所提出的损失函数也导致最小化带有正负标签的期望损失。对多种图数据集进行的大量实证评估证明了其卓越的性能。",
