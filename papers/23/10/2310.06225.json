For some tasks, LLMs achieve similar or better performance than trained human beings, therefore it is reasonable to employ human exams (e.g., certification tests) to assess the performance of LLMs. We present a comprehensive evaluation of popular LLMs, such as Llama 2 and GPT, on their ability to answer agriculture-related questions. In our evaluation, we also employ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and ER (Ensemble Refinement) techniques, which combine information retrieval, generation capabilities, and prompting strategies to improve the LLMs' performance. To demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs, we selected agriculture exams and benchmark datasets from three of the largest agriculture producer countries: Brazil, India, and the USA. Our analysis highlights GPT-4's ability to achieve a passing score on exams to earn cred",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）在各个领域，包括医疗保健和金融领域，展示了卓越的自然语言理解能力。在某些任务上，LLM的性能与训练有素的人类相似甚至更好，因此合理地使用人类考试（例如认证考试）来评估LLM的性能。我们对流行的LLM（如Llama 2和GPT）在回答农业相关问题的能力进行了全面评估。在评估过程中，我们还运用了RAG（检索增强生成）和ER（集合细化）技术，结合信息检索、生成能力和提示策略，提高LLM的性能。为了展示LLM的能力，我们选择了来自巴西、印度和美国三个最大的农业生产国的农业考试和基准数据集。我们的分析突出了GPT-4在考试中取得及格分数以获得认证的能力。",
