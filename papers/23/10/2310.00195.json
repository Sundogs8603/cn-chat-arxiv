    "abstract": "Like speech, signs are composed of discrete, recombinable features called phonemes. Prior work shows that models which can recognize phonemes are better at sign recognition, motivating deeper exploration into strategies for modeling sign language phonemes. In this work, we learn graph convolution networks to recognize the sixteen phoneme \"types\" found in ASL-LEX 2.0. Specifically, we explore how learning strategies like multi-task and curriculum learning can leverage mutually useful information between phoneme types to facilitate better modeling of sign language phonemes. Results on the Sem-Lex Benchmark show that curriculum learning yields an average accuracy of 87% across all phoneme types, outperforming fine-tuning and multi-task strategies for most phoneme types.",

    "translated_abstract": "与语音类似，手势由离散的、可重新组合的特征组成，称为音素。先前的研究表明，能够识别音素的模型在手势识别方面表现更好，因此有必要深入探索建模手语音素的策略。在这项工作中，我们学习了图卷积网络来识别ASL-LEX 2.0中发现的十六种音素“类型”。具体而言，我们探索了多任务学习和课程学习等学习策略如何利用音素类型之间的互相有用信息，以促进对手语音素的更好建模。在Sem-Lex基准测试中，课程学习在所有音素类型上取得了87%的平均准确率，对大多数音素类型而言，超过了微调和多任务策略。",
