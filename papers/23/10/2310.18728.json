    "translated_abstract": "多视角甚至多模态数据对实际应用具有吸引力但也具有挑战性。检测多视角数据中的异常是一个突出的最近研究课题。然而，大多数现有方法: 1）仅适用于两个视图或类型特定的异常，2）存在融合解耦问题，3）在模型部署后不支持在线检测。为了应对这些挑战，本文的主要思路有三个:多视图学习，解耦表示学习和生成模型。为此，我们提出了dPoE，一种新颖的多视角变分自编码器模型，它包含(1)一个专家乘积(PoE)层来处理多视图数据，(2)一个总校正(TC)鉴别器来解耦视图共享和视图特定表示，(3)一个联合损失函数来整合所有组件。此外，我们设计了理论信息界来控制视图共享和视图特定表示。大量实验验证了我们方法的有效性。",
