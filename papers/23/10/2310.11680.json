This paper proposes a new trimmed mean group (TMG) estimator which is consistent at the irregular rate of n^{1/3} even if the time dimension of the panel is as small as the number of its regressors. Extensions to panels with time effects are provided, and a Hausman-type test of correlated heterogeneity is proposed. Small sample properties of the TMG estimator (with and without time effects) are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments and shown to be satisfactory and perform better than other trimmed estimators proposed in the literature. The proposed test of correlated heterogeneity is also shown to have the correct size and satisfactory power. The utility of the TMG approach is illustrated with an empirical application.",

    "translated_abstract": "在相关异质性下，常用的两路固定效应估计方法存在偏差并可能导致误导性推断。本文提出了一种新的修剪均值组估计器（TMG estimator），即使面板的时间维度与回归变量数目一样小，也能以不规则的n^{1/3}速度保持一致性。本文还提供了适用于具有时间效应的面板的扩展方法，并提出了一种相关异质性的豪斯曼式检验。通过蒙特卡洛实验，研究了TMG估计器（带有和不带有时间效应）在小样本情况下的性质，结果表明其性能令人满意，优于文献中提出的其他修剪估计器。同时，所提出的相关异质性检验显示出正确的大小和令人满意的功效。通过实证应用，展示了TMG方法的实用性。",
