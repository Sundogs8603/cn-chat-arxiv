    "abstract": "Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing programming education by automatically generating individualized feedback for students. We investigate the role of generative AI models in providing human tutor-style programming hints to help students resolve errors in their buggy programs. Recent works have benchmarked state-of-the-art models for various feedback generation scenarios; however, their overall quality is still inferior to human tutors and not yet ready for real-world deployment. In this paper, we seek to push the limits of generative AI models toward providing high-quality programming hints and develop a novel technique, GPT4Hints-GPT3.5Val.

    "translated_abstract": "生成式人工智能和大型语言模型在提供个性化编程反馈方面具有巨大潜力。本文研究了生成式人工智能模型在提供人工导师式编程提示方面的作用，以帮助学生解决程序中的错误。然而，最新的研究工作虽然对各种反馈生成场景进行了评估，但其整体质量仍远不及人工导师，并且还没有准备好在实际环境中投入使用。为了提高生成式人工智能模型提供高质量编程提示的能力，我们开发了一种新的技术，名为GPT4Hints-GPT3.5Val。首先，我们的技术利用GPT-4作为“导师”模型生成提示，通过使用失败的测试用例的符号信息和提示中的修复方法，提高了生成质量。接下来，我们的技术利用较弱的GPT-3.5模型作为“学生”模型进一步验证提示的有效性。",
