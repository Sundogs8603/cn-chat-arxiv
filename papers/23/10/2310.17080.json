    "translated_abstract": "地衣是由真菌、藻类和/或蓝细菌组成的共生生物，能在各种环境中繁荣生长。地衣在碳和氮循环中起着重要作用，并直接或间接地对生物多样性做出贡献。生态学家通常通过使用地衣作为指示剂来评估空气质量和栖息地情况来监测地衣。特别是生长在树上的附生地衣，是评估空气质量和环境健康的关键指标。一种新的监测附生地衣的方法是使用时间序列相机来收集地衣种群的图像。这些相机被纽芬兰和拉布拉多的生态学家用来随后分析和手动分割图像以确定地衣的状态和变化。这些方法耗时且容易受到观察者偏见的影响。在这项工作中，我们旨在自动化监测地衣长达一段时间，并估计它们的生物量和状态，以便为生态学家的任务提供帮助。",
