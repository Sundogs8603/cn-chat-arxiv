    "translated_abstract": "几何在单目三维物体检测中起着重要作用。它可以通过物体的物理尺寸与图像平面中的二维投影之间的透视投影来估计物体的深度，这可以将数学先验引入深度模型。然而，这个投影过程也会引入误差放大，估计高度的误差会被放大并反映到投影的深度中。这导致深度推断不可靠，并且影响训练的稳定性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的几何不确定性传播网络(GUPNet++)，通过以概率方式建模几何投影。这确保了深度预测是有界的，并与合理的不确定性相关联。引入这种几何不确定性的意义有两个方面：(1)。它模拟了几何投影在训练过程中的不确定性传播关系，提高了端到端模型学习的稳定性和效率。",
