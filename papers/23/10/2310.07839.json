    "translated_abstract": "利用CPS数据，我们研究了从1976年到2022年期间以夫妻双方全职工作为基础的夫妻工资不平等的演变，并探讨了其对家庭收入不平等的影响。我们还调查了婚姻匹配模式在这一时期如何变化。为了确定影响收入不平等的因素，我们估计了一个解释工资联合分布的模型，考虑了配偶的就业决策。我们发现，这些家庭的收入不平等增加了，并且工资的同类配对加剧了个人工资增长所导致的不平等。我们发现，正向匹配部分反映了影响夫妻工资的不可观察因素之间的相关性。我们将样本中47年内的匹配模式变化分解为结构、构成和选择效应，并发现正向匹配的增加主要反映了观察到的技能溢价的增加。",
    "tldr": "本文利用CPS数据研究了婚姻匹配、家庭不平等和选择的关系，发现夫妻工资不平等增加，而正向匹配加剧了个人工资增长所导致的不平等，同时也反映了夫妻工资受不可观察因素的相关性影响。研究结果有助于理解收入不平等的形成以及婚姻对个人经济状况的影响。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the relationship between marital sorting, household inequality, and selection using CPS data. It finds that income inequality has increased for married couples with both spouses working full time, and positive sorting exacerbates the inequality resulting from individual wage growth. The study also highlights the influence of unobservable factors on marital wage dynamics. The findings contribute to our understanding of income inequality and the impact of marriage on individual economic conditions."
