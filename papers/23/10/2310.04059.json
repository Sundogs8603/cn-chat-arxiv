    "abstract": "Keystroke dynamics is a behavioural biometric utilised for user identification and authentication. We propose a new set of features based on the distance between keys on the keyboard, a concept that has not been considered before in keystroke dynamics. We combine flight times, a popular metric, with the distance between keys on the keyboard and call them as Distance Enhanced Flight Time features (DEFT). This novel approach provides comprehensive insights into a person's typing behaviour, surpassing typing velocity alone. We build a DEFT model by combining DEFT features with other previously used keystroke dynamic features. The DEFT model is designed to be device-agnostic, allowing us to evaluate its effectiveness across three commonly used devices: desktop, mobile, and tablet. The DEFT model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods when we evaluate its effectiveness across two datasets. We obtain accuracy rates exceeding 99% and equal error rates below 10% on all three devices",

    "translated_abstract": "键入动力学是一种用于用户识别和认证的行为生物特征。我们提出了一种新的特征集，基于键盘上按键之间的距离，这是在键入动力学中以前没有考虑过的概念。我们将飞行时间这一流行度量与键盘上的按键距离结合起来，称之为Distance Enhanced Flight Time特征(DEFT)。这种新颖的方法提供了对个人打字行为的全面洞察，超过了仅考虑打字速度。我们通过将DEFT特征与先前使用的其他键入动力学特征相结合来构建DEFT模型。DEFT模型设计成适用于各种设备，让我们可以在三种常用设备（台式机、移动设备和平板电脑）上评估其有效性。当我们在两个数据集上评估其有效性时，DEFT模型表现优于现有的最先进方法。我们获得超过99%的准确率和小于10%的等误差率的结果。",
