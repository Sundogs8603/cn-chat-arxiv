    "title": "TIMELINE: Exhaustive Annotation of Temporal Relations Supporting the Automatic Ordering of Events in News Articles. (arXiv:2310.17802v1 [cs.CL])",
    "abstract": "Temporal relation extraction models have thus far been hindered by a number of issues in existing temporal relation-annotated news datasets, including: (1) low inter-annotator agreement due to the lack of specificity of their annotation guidelines in terms of what counts as a temporal relation; (2) the exclusion of long-distance relations within a given document (those spanning across different paragraphs); and (3) the exclusion of events that are not centred on verbs. This paper aims to alleviate these issues by presenting a new annotation scheme that clearly defines the criteria based on which temporal relations should be annotated. Additionally, the scheme includes events even if they are not expressed as verbs (e.g., nominalised events). Furthermore, we propose a method for annotating all temporal relations -- including long-distance ones -- which automates the process, hence reducing time and manual effort on the part of annotators. The result is a new dataset, the TIMELINE corpus",

    "translated_abstract": "目前，对于现有的标注时间关系的新闻数据集存在一些问题，包括：(1)由于注释指南在什么算作时间关系方面缺乏具体性，导致低的标注者一致性；(2)在给定文档中排除跨不同段落的长距离关系；(3)排除不以动词为中心的事件。本文旨在通过提出一个新的注释方案来缓解这些问题，该方案明确定义了应该注释的时间关系的标准。此外，该方案还包括不以动词表达的事件（例如，名词化事件）。此外，我们提出了一种自动化注释所有时间关系（包括长距离关系）的方法，从而减少了标注者的时间和人工工作量。结果是一个新的数据集，即TIMELINE语料库。",
