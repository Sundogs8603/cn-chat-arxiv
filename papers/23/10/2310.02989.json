    "abstract": "Large Language Models have not yet been broadly adapted for the analysis of scientific datasets due in part to the unique difficulties of tokenizing numbers. We propose xVal, a numerical encoding scheme that represents any real number using just a single token. xVal represents a given real number by scaling a dedicated embedding vector by the number value. Combined with a modified number-inference approach, this strategy renders the model end-to-end continuous when considered as a map from the numbers of the input string to those of the output string. This leads to an inductive bias that is generally more suitable for applications in scientific domains. We empirically evaluate our proposal on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets. Compared with existing number encoding schemes, we find that xVal is more token-efficient and demonstrates improved generalization.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于数字令牌化的独特困难，大型语言模型尚未广泛用于科学数据集的分析。我们提出了xVal，一种数字编码方案，可以使用单个标记来表示任何实数。xVal通过将专用嵌入向量按数字值进行缩放来表示给定的实数。结合修改后的数字推断方法，该策略使模型在考虑作为从输入字符串的数字到输出字符串的数字的映射时成为端到端连续的。这导致了一种更适用于科学领域应用的归纳偏差。我们在许多合成和现实世界数据集上进行了实证评估。与现有的数字编码方案相比，我们发现xVal在令牌效率和泛化性能上表现更好。",
