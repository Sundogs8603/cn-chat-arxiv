    "translated_abstract": "几何深度学习(GDL)在各个科学领域引起了广泛关注，主要是因为其擅长对具有复杂几何结构的数据进行建模。然而，很少有研究探索其在处理分布转换问题上的能力，这是许多相关应用中常见的挑战。为了弥补这一空白，我们提出了GDL-DS，这是一个全面的基准测试，旨在评估GDL模型在具有分布转换的场景中的性能。我们的评估数据集涵盖了从粒子物理学和材料科学到生物化学的不同科学领域，并包括各种分布转换，包括条件、协变和概念转换。此外，我们研究了来自超出分布的测试数据的信息访问的三个级别，包括没有超出分布的信息、只有带标签的超出分布特征和带有少数标签的超出分布特征。总体而言，我们的基准测试涉及30个不同的实验设置，并评估3种信息访问水平。",
