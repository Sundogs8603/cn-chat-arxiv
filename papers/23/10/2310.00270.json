This problem is of fundamental importance to public safety and urban administration especially when limited resources are available. The problem is, however, challenging due to complex and dynamic spatio-temporal correlations between locations, uneven distribution of urban events in space, and the difficulty to correctly rank nearby locations with similar features.

Rankings obtained as such usually have low quality due to prediction errors.

    "translated_abstract": "城市事件排名问题旨在预测未来事件（如交通事故和犯罪事件）的风险最高的前k个地点。这个问题对公共安全和城市管理非常重要，尤其是在资源有限的情况下。然而，由于地点之间复杂而动态的时空相关性，空间中城市事件的不均匀分布，以及正确对具有相似特征的附近地点进行排名的困难，这个问题很具挑战性。前人的研究主要旨在准确预测所有地点的实际风险得分或事件计数。由于预测错误，由此得到的排名通常质量较低。学习排序方法直接优化诸如标准化折扣累积增益（NDCG）之类的指标，但不能处理地点之间存在的时空自相关性。在本文中，我们通过提出一种名为SpatialRank的新颖空间事件排名方法来弥合这一差距。",
