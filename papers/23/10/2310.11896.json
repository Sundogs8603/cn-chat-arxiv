Deep learning (DL) models have achieved end-to-end image fusion with highly robust and accurate fusion performance.

    "translated_abstract": "医学图像融合结合了多模态医学图像的补充信息，以协助医学专业人员在临床诊断中确诊患者疾病，并在术前和术中提供指导。深度学习模型实现了具有高鲁棒性和准确性的端到端图像融合。然而，大多数基于深度学习的融合模型对输入图像进行下采样，以最小化可学习参数和计算量。在此过程中，源图像的显著特征变得无法恢复，导致丢失关键的诊断边缘细节和各种脑组织的对比度。本文提出了一种基于整合的拉普拉斯-高斯级联和注意力池化的新型多模态医学图像融合模型。我们证明了我们的模型有效地保留了补充信息和重要的组织结构。",
