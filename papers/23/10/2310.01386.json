    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）最近展示了其卓越的能力，不仅在自然语言处理任务中，而且跨越了临床医学、法律咨询和教育等各个领域。LLMs已经超出了简单的应用，演变成能够解决各种用户请求的助手。这缩小了人类和人工智能代理之间的差距，引发了有关LLMs内部个性、性格和情绪潜在表现的有趣问题。在本文中，我们提出了一个框架PsychoBench，用于评估LLMs的各种心理因素。PsychoBench由临床心理学中常用的13个量表组成，进一步将这些量表分为四个不同的类别：人格特质、人际关系、动机测试和情感能力。我们的研究重点考察了五个流行的模型，分别是text-davinci-003、gpt-3.5-turbo、gpt-4、LLaMA-2-7b和LLaMA-2-13b。",
