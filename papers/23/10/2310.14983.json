We provide an econometric framework to choose the clustering that minimizes the worst-case mean-squared error of the estimated global treatment effect. We show that the optimal clustering can be approximated as the solution of a novel penalized min-cut optimization problem computed via off-the-shelf semi-definite programming algorithms. Our analysis also characterizes easy-to-check conditions to choose between a cluster or individual-level randomization. We illustrate the method's properties using unique network data from the universe of Facebook's users and existing network data from a field experiment.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在单一网络存在外溢效应的情况下，设计集群实验来估计全局治疗效果。我们提供了一个计量经济学的框架，选择最小化估计的全局治疗效果的最坏均方误差的聚类方法。我们展示了最优聚类方法可以近似为通过现成的半定规划算法计算的一种新型惩罚最小割优化问题的解。我们的分析还确定了选择簇或个体级随机化之间易于检查的条件。我们使用来自Facebook用户宇宙的独特网络数据和现有的网络实验数据来说明该方法的特性。",
