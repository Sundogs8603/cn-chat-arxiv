    "translated_abstract": "在计算机科学中，解决复杂的规划问题一直是一个长期存在的挑战。基于学习的子目标搜索方法在处理这些问题上显示出了很大的潜力，但它们经常缺乏完整性保证，这意味着它们可能无法找到解决方案，即使存在一个解决方案。在本文中，我们提出了一种有效的方法来增强子目标搜索方法，以实现在离散动作空间中的完整性。具体地，我们通过在高级搜索中添加低级动作来执行多层次（混合）搜索，我们称之为完整的子目标搜索。这个解决方案实现了高级搜索的实际效率和低级搜索的完整性的最佳结合。我们将所提出的搜索方法应用于最近提出的子目标搜索算法，并评估使用离线数据训练的算法在复杂的规划问题上的表现。我们证明我们的完整子目标搜索不仅保证了完整性，还可以改进性能。",
