    "abstract": "Inventory matching is a standard mechanism/auction for trading financial stocks by which buyers and sellers can be paired. In the financial world, banks often undertake the task of finding such matches between their clients. The related stocks can be traded without adversely impacting the market price for either client. If matches between clients are found, the bank can offer the trade at advantageous rates. If no match is found, the parties have to buy or sell the stock in the public market, which introduces additional costs. A problem with the process as it is presently conducted is that the involved parties must share their order to buy or sell a particular stock, along with the intended quantity (number of shares), to the bank. Clients worry that if this information were to leak somehow, then other market participants would become aware of their intentions and thus cause the price to move adversely against them before their transaction finalizes. We provide a solution, Prime Match,",

    "translated_abstract": "库存配对是一种标准的金融股票交易机制/拍卖，买家和卖家可以进行配对交易。在金融界中，银行经常承担寻找客户之间匹配的任务。相关的股票可以交易，而不会对任何一方的市场价格产生不利影响。如果找到了客户之间的匹配，银行可以以优惠价格进行交易。如果找不到匹配，当事方必须在公开市场上购买或出售股票，这会增加额外的成本。当前该过程存在的问题是，相关当事方必须与银行分享他们买入或卖出特定股票的订单以及预期数量（股票数量）。客户担心，如果这些信息在某种方式下泄露，那么其他市场参与者将知晓他们的意图，并在他们的交易完成之前导致股票价格逆势波动。我们提供了一个解决方法，Prime Match，",
