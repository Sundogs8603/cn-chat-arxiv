    "translated_abstract": "在自主智能体研究中，在具有动态物体的环境中进行导航的挑战仍然是一个核心问题。虽然预测方法很有前景，但它们对精确状态信息的依赖使其在实际世界中的应用不太实用。本研究提出了视觉预测作为一种创新的替代方法。通过引入直观的视觉提示，这种方法可以投射动态物体的未来轨迹，以提高智能体的感知能力并实现预期的动作。我们的研究探索了两种不同的策略来通过视觉预测传达预测信息：（1）边界框序列和（2）增强路径。为了验证所提出的视觉预测策略，我们在Unity引擎的模拟环境中进行评估，并将这些评估扩展到实际场景中，以评估其实用性和有效性。结果证实了视觉预测作为导航问题的有前途的解决方案的可行性。",
