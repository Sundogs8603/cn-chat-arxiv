    "abstract": "Distributional reinforcement learning algorithms have attempted to utilize estimated uncertainty for exploration, such as optimism in the face of uncertainty. However, using the estimated variance for optimistic exploration may cause biased data collection and hinder convergence or performance. In this paper, we present a novel distributional reinforcement learning algorithm that selects actions by randomizing risk criterion to avoid one-sided tendency on risk. We provide a perturbed distributional Bellman optimality operator by distorting the risk measure and prove the convergence and optimality of the proposed method with the weaker contraction property. Our theoretical results support that the proposed method does not fall into biased exploration and is guaranteed to converge to an optimal return. Finally, we empirically show that our method outperforms other existing distribution-based algorithms in various environments including Atari 55 games.",

    "translated_abstract": "分布式强化学习算法试图利用估计的不确定性进行探索，如在面对不确定性时的乐观主义。然而，使用估计的方差进行乐观探索可能导致数据收集的偏差，阻碍收敛或性能。本文提出了一种新颖的分布式强化学习算法，通过随机化风险标准来选择动作，避免在风险上的单向倾向。我们通过扭曲风险度量提供了一个扰动的分布贝尔曼最优性算子，并证明了所提方法具有较弱的收缩性质的收敛性和最优性。我们的理论结果支持，所提方法不会陷入偏向性的探索，并确保收敛到最优回报。最后，我们在包括Atari 55游戏在内的各种环境中通过实验证明了我们的方法优于其他现有的基于分布的算法。",
