    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，深度学习模型已成功应用于增强低分辨率的宇宙学模拟的小尺度信息，这被称为“超分辨率”任务。迄今为止，这些宇宙学超分辨率模型依赖于生成对抗网络（GANs），这些网络可以实现高度逼真的结果，但存在各种缺点（例如低样本多样性）。我们使用去噪扩散模型作为一种强大的生成模型，来实现超分辨率的宇宙大尺度结构预测（作为二维的首个概念证明）。为了获得准确的小尺度结果，我们开发了一种新的“滤波增强”训练方法，重新分配了像素级训练目标中不同尺度的重要性。我们证明了我们的模型不仅能够产生令人信服的超分辨率图像和百分之一水平一致的功率谱，并且能够重现与小尺度特征多样性一致的结果。",
