    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the research agendas of most scientific communities, resulting in an overwhelming production of research articles in a variety of domains, including medicine, virology, epidemiology, economy, psychology, and so on. Several open-access corpora and literature hubs were established; among them, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) has systematically gathered scientific contributions for 2.5 years, by collecting and indexing over one million articles. Here, we present the CORD-19 Topic Visualizer (CORToViz), a method and associated visualization tool for inspecting the CORD-19 textual corpus of scientific abstracts. Our method is based upon a careful selection of up-to-date technologies (including large language models), resulting in an architecture for clustering articles along orthogonal dimensions and extraction techniques for temporal topic mining. Topic inspection is supported by an interactive dashboard, providing fast, one-click visualizatio",

    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19大流行改变了大多数科学界的研究议程，导致在医学、病毒学、流行病学、经济学、心理学等众多领域产生了大量的研究文章。建立了几个开放获取的语料库和文献集散地，其中COVID-19开放研究数据集（CORD-19）系统地收集了2.5年的科学贡献，总共收集和索引了100多万篇文章。我们在这里提出了CORD-19主题可视化工具（CORToViz），这是一种用于检查CORD-19科学摘要文本语料库的方法和相关可视化工具。我们的方法基于对最新技术（包括大型语言模型）的精心选择，从而形成了一种用于沿着正交维度聚类文章和时间主题挖掘的架构。主题检查得到了一个交互式仪表板的支持，提供了快速、一键式的可视化功能。",
