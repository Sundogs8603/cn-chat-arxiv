    "translated_abstract": "在差分隐私框架下，我们考虑了高维稀疏线性回归模型中的模型选择问题。具体而言，我们考虑了差分隐私最佳子集选择的问题，并研究了其效用保证。我们采用了广为人知的指数机制来选择最佳模型，并在一定边界条件下，建立了其强模型恢复性质。然而，指数机制的指数搜索空间导致了严重的计算瓶颈。为了克服这个挑战，我们提出了Metropolis-Hastings算法来进行采样步骤，并在问题参数$n$、$p$和$s$中建立了其到稳态分布的多项式混合时间。此外，我们还利用其混合性质建立了Metropolis-Hastings随机行走的最终估计的近似差分隐私性质。最后，我们还进行了一些说明性模拟，印证了我们主要结果的理论发现。",

It proposes using the exponential mechanism for model selection and overcomes the computational complexity of the exponential search space by introducing the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. The proposed algorithm achieves strong model recovery property, has polynomial mixing time, and provides approximate differential privacy guarantees."
