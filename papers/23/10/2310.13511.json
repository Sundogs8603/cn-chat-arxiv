    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种利用非线性波动率动态模型的动态最小方差投资组合（MVP）模型，基于高频金融数据。具体来说，我们将MVP过程 imposed 一个自回归动态结构，有助于直接捕捉MVP的动态。为了评估动态MVP模型，我们使用约束的$\\ell_1$-最小化逆矩阵估计（CLIME）来估计逆波动率矩阵，并计算每日实现的非归一化MVP权重。基于实现的非归一化MVP权重估计器，我们提出了动态MVP模型，称为动态实现最小方差投资组合（DR-MVP）模型。为了估计大量的参数，我们采用最小绝对收缩和选择算子（LASSO），并预测未来的MVP并建立其渐近性质。使用高频交易数据，我们将所提出的方法应用于MVP预测。",
