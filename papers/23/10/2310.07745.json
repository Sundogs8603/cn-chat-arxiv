    "translated_abstract": "近年来网络攻击数量的快速增加引发了对针对恶意行为的网络防御方法的需求。深度强化学习（DRL）已经成为缓解这些攻击的一种有希望的方法。然而，尽管DRL在网络防御方面显示出了很大的潜力，但在将DRL应用于大规模自主网络安全行动（ACO）之前，还需要克服许多挑战。需要为与学习者面对非常高维度状态空间、大规模多离散操作空间和对抗学习相遇的环境提供有原则的方法。最近的研究在解决这些问题方面取得了成功。针对实时策略游戏也进行了印象深刻的工程努力。然而，将DRL应用于完整的ACO问题仍然是一个未解决的挑战。在这里，我们对相关的DRL文献进行了调查，并构想了一个理想化的ACO-DRL代理。我们提供了：i.) 领域特性的总结",
