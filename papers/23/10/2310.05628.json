    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，鉴于投资者对环境、社会和治理（ESG）问题越来越关注，一些监管机构开始要求上市公司披露非财务信息。这些信息以各种非结构化的多模态文档形式公开发布。因此，将这些数据聚合和整合到一个一致的框架中，以进一步推导出跨公司和市场的可持续性实践见解并不直观。鉴于这些前提，自然而然地，我们可以采用信息抽取（IE）技术为利益相关者提供简洁、信息丰富和可行动的数据。在本研究中，我们突破了传统的文本处理技术，利用大型语言模型（LLMs），结合突出的上下文学习技术和检索增强生成（RAG）范式，从公司的可持续性报告中提取具有语义结构的与ESG相关的信息。",
