    "abstract": "To address the challenges posed by the heterogeneity inherent in federated learning (FL) and to attract high-quality clients, various incentive mechanisms have been employed. However, existing incentive mechanisms are typically utilized in conventional synchronous aggregation, resulting in significant straggler issues. In this study, we propose a novel asynchronous FL framework that integrates an incentive mechanism based on contract theory. Within the incentive mechanism, we strive to maximize the utility of the task publisher by adaptively adjusting clients' local model training epochs, taking into account factors such as time delay and test accuracy. In the asynchronous scheme, considering client quality, we devise aggregation weights and an access control algorithm to facilitate asynchronous aggregation. Through experiments conducted on the MNIST dataset, the simulation results demonstrate that the test accuracy achieved by our framework is 3.12% and 5.84% higher than that achieved",

    "translated_abstract": "为了解决联邦学习中固有的异构性以及吸引高质量的客户所带来的挑战，已经使用了各种各样的激励机制。然而，现有的激励机制通常在传统的同步聚合中使用，导致了显著的慢速问题。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种基于合同理论的新型异步联邦学习框架。在激励机制中，我们努力通过自适应调整客户端的本地模型训练轮数来最大化任务发布者的效用，考虑到时间延迟和测试准确性等因素。在异步方案中，考虑到客户端质量，我们设计了聚合权重和访问控制算法，以促进异步聚合。通过在MNIST数据集上进行的实验证明，我们的框架实现的测试准确率比其他方法高出3.12%和5.84%。",
