Researchers consistently seek accurate, current information about these events at all stages. This data surge necessitates an intelligent question-answering system to efficiently address researchers' queries and ensure awareness of the latest advancements. The information of conferences is usually published on their official website, organized in a semi-structured way with a lot of text. To address this need, we have developed the ConferenceQA dataset for 7 diverse academic conferences with human annotations. Firstly, we employ a combination of manual and automated methods to organize academic conference data in a semi-structured JSON format. Subsequently, we annotate nearly 100 question-answer pairs for each conference. Each pair is classified into four different dimensions. To ensure the reliability of the data, we manually annotate ",

    "translated_abstract": "计算机科学的快速发展导致学术会议上的研究大量增加，促进了全球学术交流。研究人员在各个阶段都持续寻求关于这些事件的准确、最新信息。这种数据爆发需要一个智能的问答系统来高效解决研究人员的问题，并确保对最新进展的了解。会议信息通常在官方网站上发布，以半结构化的方式组织，并包含大量的文本。为了满足这一需求，我们开发了ConferenceQA数据集，涵盖了7个不同学术会议，并进行了人工标注。首先，我们采用手动和自动方法的组合，以半结构化的JSON格式组织学术会议数据。随后，我们为每个会议注释了近100个问题-答案对。每个对应对应了四个不同的维度分类。为了确保数据的可靠性，我们手动进行了标注。",
