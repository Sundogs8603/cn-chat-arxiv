    "translated_abstract": "条件故事生成在人机交互中非常重要，特别是在生成具有复杂情节的故事方面。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在多个自然语言处理任务中表现出色，包括故事生成，但是生成既复杂又有创意的故事是具有挑战性的。现有方法通常依赖于详细的提示来引导LLMs满足目标条件，这无意间限制了生成故事的创造潜力。我们认为利用优秀的人类写作故事的信息有助于生成更多样化的情节。深入研究故事细节有助于构建复杂而可信的情节。在本文中，我们提出了一种具有检索增强的带有证据森林的故事生成框架（GROVE）来增强故事的复杂性。我们构建了一个用于目标条件的检索存储库，以产生少样本示例来引导LLMs。此外，我们设计了一个“询问为什么”的提示。",
