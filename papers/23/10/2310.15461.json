    "translated_abstract": "自主引导式心理健康干预，如学习和实践应对策略的“自助工具”，在改善心理健康护理的可及性方面显示出巨大潜力。然而，这些干预常常需要认知负担和情绪触发，从而造成限制其大规模实施和普及的可及性障碍。本文研究人机语言模型交互如何支持自主引导式心理健康干预。我们以认知重建作为一个以证据为基础的治疗技术的案例研究。在一项经过IRB批准的大型心理健康网站上进行的随机现场研究中，涉及了15,531名参与者，我们设计并评估了一个使用语言模型来支持人们在认知重建的各个步骤中的系统。我们的研究结果表明，我们的系统对67%的参与者的情绪强度产生积极影响，并帮助65%的人克服消极思维。尽管青少年报道较差。",
