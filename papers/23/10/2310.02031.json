    "translated_abstract": "海洋科学是探索充满生命和生物多样性的海洋的科学，考虑到海洋覆盖了地球表面的70％以上，这一领域具有重要意义。最近，大型语言模型（LLM）的进展改变了科学的范式。尽管在其他领域取得了成功，但现有的LLM通常无法满足海洋学家等领域专家的需求，同时对LLM在海洋科学中的潜力尚未得到充分探索。这其中的根本原因可能是海洋数据的庞大而复杂的性质，以及对更高的粒度和丰富的知识的需求。为了解决这些问题，我们推出了首个海洋领域的LLM——OceanGPT，该模型擅长各种海洋科学任务。我们提出了一个新颖的框架DoInstruct，用于自动获取大量的海洋领域指导数据，它基于多智能体的协作生成指导。",
