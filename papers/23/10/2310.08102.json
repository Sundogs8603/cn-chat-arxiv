    "translated_abstract": "当前，问答（QA）任务受到重视，尤其是随着大型语言模型（LLM）如Chat GPT的发展。LLM可以应用于各个领域，但将其应用于伊斯兰领域时，与信息传递原则相矛盾。在伊斯兰教中，我们严格规定信息来源和谁可以对该来源进行解释或注释。LLM的回答生成方法与注释概念类似，LLM既不是伊斯兰专家，也不是人类，这在伊斯兰教中是不允许的。印度尼西亚是世界上信奉伊斯兰教人口最多的国家。在LLM的高影响下，我们需要对宗教领域的LLM进行评估。目前，只有少数宗教问答数据集可用，其中没有一个使用尤尼语的《先知传记》。在本文中，我们提出了基于《先知传记》的问答系统(QASiNa)。",
