    "translated_abstract": "最近十年，随着效率需求的上升和货物量的不断增加，下一代港口的概念变得更加明显。在这个智能基础设施和设施的新时代，很明显网络安全已经成为海港和海事当局近期最关注的问题，并且是大多数港口议程上的首要关注点。传统的安全解决方案可以应用于保护物联网和物理网络系统免受有害实体的侵害。然而，如果这些解决方案更透明地运行，安全研究人员只能观察、检查和了解攻击者的行为。因此，蜜罐是潜在的解决方案，因为它们提供有关攻击者的宝贵信息。蜜罐可以是虚拟的或物理的。虚拟蜜罐必须更加逼真以吸引攻击者，因此需要更好的高度逼真性。为此，可以采用数字孪生技术(DT)。",
    "tldr": "该论文介绍了一种数字孪生辅助的蜜罐，用于保护智能海港的网络安全。传统安全解决方案对于保护物联网和物理网络系统是有限的，而蜜罐则可以提供有关攻击者行为的宝贵信息。数字孪生技术可以增强虚拟蜜罐的逼真性，吸引更多的攻击者。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a digital twin-assisted honeypot for protecting the cybersecurity of smart seaports. Traditional security solutions have limitations in safeguarding IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems, while honeypots can provide valuable information about attacker behaviors. Digital twin technology enhances the realism of virtual honeypots and attracts more attackers."
