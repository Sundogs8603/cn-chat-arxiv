    "translated_abstract": "CLEF eRisk实验室探索与互联网风险检测相关的不同任务的解决方案。在2023年的比赛中，任务1是搜索抑郁症症状，其目标是根据与BDI问卷症状相关性提取用户的写作。任务2与早期发现病理性赌博风险的问题有关，参与者需要尽快检测到有风险的用户。最后，任务3是估计饮食紊乱迹象的严重程度。我们的研究小组参与了前两个任务，并提出了基于Transformer的解决方案。在任务1中，我们应用了不同的方法，这些方法可以在信息检索任务中很有趣。两个提案是基于语境化嵌入向量的相似性，另一个则基于提示，这是一种吸引人的当前机器学习技术。在任务2中，我们提出了三个经过微调的模型，其后跟决策策略。",
