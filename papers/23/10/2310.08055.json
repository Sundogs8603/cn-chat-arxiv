    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种利用gamma分布的随机变量和log-Gaussian建模的方法，用于生成适合训练神经网络的合成数据集。这种方法解决了各种应用中实际观测数据有限的挑战。我们将此方法应用于Raman和相干防-斯托克斯拉曼散射(CARS)光谱中，使用实验光谱估计gamma过程的参数。参数估计使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法进行，从而为模型提供完整贝叶斯后验分布，可用于合成数据生成。此外，我们使用高斯过程对Raman和CARS的加性和乘性背景函数进行建模。我们训练了两个贝叶斯神经网络来估计gamma过程的参数，然后可以用这些参数来估计基础的Raman光谱，并通过概率分布参数的估计同时提供不确定性。",
