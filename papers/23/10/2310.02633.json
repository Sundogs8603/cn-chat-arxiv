    "translated_abstract": "决策树具有易于解释的优点，因为它们允许根据if-then规则对输入数据进行分类。然而，决策树是由一个算法构建的，该算法通过最少的规则实现清晰的分类，而无论数据中是否存在各种潜在规则，都只能提取最小的规则。确实存在使用随机选择的特征子集构建多棵决策树的方法。然而，可以构建的树的数量仍然在相同的数量级，因为特征子集的数量是一个组合性爆炸。此外，当构建多棵树时，会生成许多规则，其中有几个是不可靠和/或非常相似的。因此，我们提出了“MAABO-MT”和“GS-MRM”算法，它们分别在所有可能的树中高性能估计构建树，并仅提取可靠且不相似的规则。",
