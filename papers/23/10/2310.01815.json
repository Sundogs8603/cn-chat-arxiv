    "translated_abstract": "在数字艺术的不断发展中，非同质化代币（NFT）已经成为一个突破性的平台，桥接了艺术和技术领域。NFT作为一种基础框架，彻底改变了数字艺术市场，使艺术家能够以前所未有的方式展示和变现自己的作品。NFT将存储在区块链上的元数据与离链数据（例如图像）相结合，创建了一种新颖的数字所有权形式。目前还不完全清楚这些因素如何共同决定NFT的价格。在本研究中，我们分析了在OpenSea交易的NFT收藏的链上和链下数据，以了解什么影响NFT的定价。我们的研究结果表明，尽管NFT的文本和图像数据可以用来解释收藏中价格的变化，但这些提取的特征不能推广到新的、未见过的收藏品。此外，我们发现NFT收藏的交易量往往与其在线存在（如社交媒体关注者数量）有关。",
