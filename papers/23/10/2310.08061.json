    "abstract": "Predicting the docking between proteins and ligands is a crucial and challenging task for drug discovery. However, traditional docking methods mainly rely on scoring functions, and deep learning-based docking approaches usually neglect the 3D spatial information of proteins and ligands, as well as the graph-level features of ligands, which limits their performance. To address these limitations, we propose an equivariant transformer neural network for protein-ligand docking pose prediction. Our approach involves the fusion of ligand graph-level features by feature processing, followed by the learning of ligand and protein representations using our proposed TAMformer module. Additionally, we employ an iterative optimization approach based on the predicted distance matrix to generate refined ligand poses. The experimental results on real datasets show that our model can achieve state-of-the-art performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "预测蛋白质和配体之间的对接是药物开发中关键且具有挑战性的任务。然而，传统的对接方法主要依赖于评分函数，而基于深度学习的对接方法通常忽略了蛋白质和配体的3D空间信息以及配体的图层特征，限制了它们的性能。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一种蛋白质-配体对接位姿预测的等变Transformer神经网络。我们的方法通过特征处理来融合配体的图层特征，然后使用我们提出的TAMformer模块学习配体和蛋白质的表示。此外，我们采用基于预测的距离矩阵的迭代优化方法来生成精炼的配体位姿。实验结果表明，我们的模型可以达到最先进的性能水平。",
