    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made its way into various scientific fields, providing astonishing improvements over existing algorithms for a wide variety of tasks. In recent years, there have been severe concerns over the trustworthiness of AI technologies. The scientific community has focused on the development of trustworthy AI algorithms. However, machine and deep learning algorithms, popular in the AI community today, depend heavily on the data used during their development. These learning algorithms identify patterns in the data, learning the behavioral objective. Any flaws in the data have the potential to translate directly into algorithms. In this study, we discuss the importance of Responsible Machine Learning Datasets and propose a framework to evaluate the datasets through a responsible rubric.

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能已经进入各个科学领域，在各种任务上比现有算法有了惊人的改进。近年来，人们对人工智能技术的可信性存在严重担忧。科学界致力于开发可信的人工智能算法。然而，目前在人工智能社区中流行的机器学习和深度学习算法在其开发过程中严重依赖使用的数据。这些学习算法通过识别数据中的模式来学习行为目标。数据中的任何缺陷都有可能直接转化为算法的缺陷。在这项研究中，我们讨论了负责任的机器学习数据集的重要性，并提出了一个通过负责任评价标准来评估数据集的框架。现有的工作侧重于对算法的后期评估以确保其可信性，而我们提供了一个框架，单独考虑数据组件以理解其特性。",
