    "abstract": "Rapid progress has been made in instruction-learning for image editing with natural-language instruction, as exemplified by InstructPix2Pix. In biomedicine, such methods can be applied to counterfactual image generation, which helps differentiate causal structure from spurious correlation and facilitate robust image interpretation for disease progression modeling. However, generic image-editing models are ill-suited for the biomedical domain, and counterfactual biomedical image generation is largely underexplored. In this paper, we present BiomedJourney, a novel method for counterfactual biomedical image generation by instruction-learning from multimodal patient journeys. Given a patient with two biomedical images taken at different time points, we use GPT-4 to process the corresponding imaging reports and generate a natural language description of disease progression. The resulting triples (prior image, progression description, new image) are then used to train a latent diffusion mode",

    "translated_abstract": "随着自然语言指令图像编辑的指导学习取得了快速进展，如InstructPix2Pix，生物医学领域可以将这些方法应用于反事实图像生成，从而帮助区分因果结构和伪相关，并促进疾病进展建模的稳健图像解释。然而，通用的图像编辑模型并不适用于生物医学领域，反事实生物医学图像生成的研究还远未深入。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法BiomedJourney，通过指导学习多模态患者旅程，进行反事实生物医学图像生成。给定一个拍摄于不同时间点的两个生物医学图像的患者，我们使用GPT-4处理相应的图像报告，并生成疾病进展的自然语言描述。然后，使用生成的三元组（先前图像、进展描述、新图像）来训练一个潜在扩散模型。",
