Examining real-life applications benefit learning practical ethics in many situations, offering valuable data to grasp the complexities of human ethics in diverse contexts. In this paper, we examine social media platforms for understanding real-life ethical scenarios and human moral judgments. We examine posts from a popular Reddit subreddit (i.e., a subcommunity) called r/AmITheAsshole, where authors and commenters share their moral judgments on who is blameworthy. We employ computational techniques to investigate the underlying reasoning influencing moral judgments. We focus on excerpts-which we term moral sparks-from original posts that commenters include to indicate what motivates their judgments. To this end, we examine how (1) events activating social commonsense and (2) linguistic signals affect moral sparks assignment and their sub",
