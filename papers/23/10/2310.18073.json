    "translated_abstract": "目录（ToC）提取侧重于以分层的方式对文档进行结构化。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的数据集ESGDoc，包括来自2001年至2022年的563家公司的1,093份ESG年度报告。这些报告由于其多样的结构和广泛的长度而带来了重大挑战。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种新的Toc提取框架，包括三个步骤：（1）根据阅读顺序和字体大小构建文本块的初始树；（2）通过考虑节点为中心的子树中捕获的上下文信息，单独对每个树节点（或文本块）进行建模；（3）通过对每个树节点（保留、删除或移动）采取适当的操作来修改原始树。这个构建-建模-修改（CMM）过程具有几个优势。它消除了以前方法中需要成对建模节标题的需要，使得文档分割实际可行。通过结合结构性的特征信息，我们可以显著改进目录提取的准确性。",
