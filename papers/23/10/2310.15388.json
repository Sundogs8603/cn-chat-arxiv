    "translated_abstract": "深度学习的最新进展使得通过分析视频远程估计心率在智能环境中变得越来越可行。然而，深度学习方法的一个显著限制是它们对大量标记数据的严重依赖以进行有效的训练。为了解决这个问题，自监督学习作为一种有前途的途径应运而生。在此基础上，我们提出了一种解决方案，利用自监督对比学习来估计远程光谱测量（PPG）和心率监测，从而减少对标记数据的依赖并提高性能。我们提出使用3种空间和3种时间增强方法训练编码器，并通过对比框架利用编码器的后期中间嵌入进行远程PPG和心率估计。我们在两个公开数据集上的实验展示了我们提出的方法在多个相关工作以及监督学习方法上的改进。",
