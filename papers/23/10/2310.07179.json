    "translated_abstract": "卫星图像的新视角综合具有广泛的实际应用。虽然最近神经辐射场的进展主要针对针孔相机，而卫星相机的模型通常需要足够的输入视图。本文提出了rpcPRF，一种基于多平面图像(MPI)的有理多项式相机(RPC)的平面神经辐射场。与需要足够多场景视图的基于坐标的神经辐射场不同，我们的模型适用于单个或少量输入，并在未见场景的图像上表现良好。为了实现跨场景的泛化，我们建议使用重投影监督来诱导预测的MPI学习3D坐标与图像之间的正确几何关系。此外，我们通过引入辐射场渲染技术，消除了深度多视图立体方法对密集深度监督的严格要求。rpcPRF结合了隐式表示的优势和渲染技术的优点。",
