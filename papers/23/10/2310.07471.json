    "translated_abstract": "区块链承诺通过提供进一步的分散化、安全性、不可变性和信任来增强联邦学习等分布式机器学习方法，这些特性对于实现下一代应用中的协作智能至关重要。然而，点对点（P2P）区块链节点的内在分散化操作使得联邦学习处于未知的状态，FL轮次和全局模型的概念变得无意义，因为设备的同步丢失了中心协调服务器的形象。在本文中，我们研究将FL的协调外包给区块链等民主网络的实际影响。具体而言，我们关注由区块链的运作方式支持的模型陈旧和不一致对异步进行的FL训练过程的影响。通过模拟，我们评估了基于区块链的FL在著名的CIFAR-10数据集上的运作情况，并着重研究。",
