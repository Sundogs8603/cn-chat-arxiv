    "translated_abstract": "建模序列之间的长程依赖一直是机器学习中的目标，并导致了一些架构，如状态空间模型，在处理长序列时比Transformers有显著的优势。然而，这些令人印象深刻的经验性进展主要是在随机初始化并通过预测输入序列的目标标签进行训练的基准测试（例如Long Range Arena）上展示出来的。在这项工作中，我们展示了随机初始化导致对架构之间差异的严重高估，并且使用标准消噪目标进行预训练（仅使用下游任务数据）可以在多种架构上实现显著的收益，并且可以在Transformers和状态空间模型（SSMs）之间得到很小的差距。与之前的研究形成鲜明对比的是，我们发现当正确预训练时，普通的Transformers在Long Range Arena上与S4的性能相匹配，并且我们在PathX-256任务上将SSMs的最佳报告结果提高了20个百分点。",
