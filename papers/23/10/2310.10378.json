With the ultimate goal of ensuring that users with different language backgrounds obtain consistent feedback from the same model, we study the cross-lingual consistency (CLC) of factual knowledge in various multilingual PLMs. To this end, we propose a Ranking-based Consistency (RankC) metric to evaluate knowledge consistency across languages independently from accuracy. Using this metric, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the determining factors for CLC, both at model level and at language-pair level.

    "translated_abstract": "多语言大规模预训练语言模型（PLM）显示存储了大量的事实知识，但在不同语言之间存在较大的变化。为了确保不同语言背景的用户从同一个模型中获得一致的反馈，我们研究了各种多语言PLM中事实知识的跨语言一致性（CLC）。为此，我们提出了一种基于排序的一致性（RankC）度量，用于独立于准确性评估跨语言间的知识一致性。利用这个度量方法，我们对决定CLC的因素进行了深入分析，包括模型层面和语言对层面。在其他结果中，我们发现增加模型大小可以提高大多数语言中的事实探测准确性，但不能改善跨语言一致性。最后，我们通过模型编辑在PLMs中插入新的事实关联进行了一个CLC的案例研究。对一小部分事实进行了实验。",

A new metric is proposed to evaluate knowledge consistency independently from accuracy. The analysis reveals factors influencing consistency, such as model size and language pairs. Results show that increasing model size improves accuracy but does not enhance cross-lingual consistency."
