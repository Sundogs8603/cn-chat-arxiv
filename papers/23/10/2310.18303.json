    "abstract": "Emerging applications of robotics, and concerns about their impact, require the research community to put human-centric objectives front-and-center. To meet this challenge, we advocate an interdisciplinary approach, socially cognizant robotics, which synthesizes technical and social science methods. We argue that this approach follows from the need to empower stakeholder participation (from synchronous human feedback to asynchronous societal assessment) in shaping AI-driven robot behavior at all levels, and leads to a range of novel research perspectives and problems both for improving robots' interactions with individuals and impacts on society. Drawing on these arguments, we develop best practices for socially cognizant robot design that balance traditional technology-based metrics (e.g. efficiency, precision and accuracy) with critically important, albeit challenging to measure, human and society-based metrics.",

    "translated_abstract": "新兴的机器人应用和对其影响的关注，要求研究社区将以人为中心的目标放在首位。为了应对这一挑战，我们提倡一种跨学科的方法，即社交认知机器人，它综合了技术和社会科学的方法。我们认为，这种方法的出发点是为了使利益相关者能够参与其中，从同步的人类反馈到异步的社会评估，以塑造人工智能驱动的机器人行为，并产生一系列关于改善机器人与个人互动和对社会影响的新颖研究视角和问题。基于这些论点，我们制定了在社交认知机器人设计中平衡传统的技术指标（如效率、精度和准确性）与重要但难以衡量的人类和社会指标的最佳实践方法。",
