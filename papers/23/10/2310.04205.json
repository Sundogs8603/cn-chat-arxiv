    "translated_abstract": "使用语言模型从结构化和非结构化数据的组合中快速、低成本地检索答案，而不产生幻觉，是阻止语言模型在知识检索自动化中应用的一大障碍。当想要集成语音接口时，这一问题变得更加突出。此外，对于商业搜索和聊天机器人应用来说，完全依赖商业大型语言模型（如GPT 3.5等）可能非常昂贵。本文作者通过首先开发基于关键词的搜索框架来解决这个问题，该框架增强了对要提供给大型语言模型的上下文的发现。关键词反过来是由语言模型生成并缓存，以便与查询生成的关键词进行比较。这显著减少了在文档中查找上下文所需的时间和成本。一旦上下文设置好了，语言模型就可以根据为问答定制的提示提供答案。这项研究工作表明，",
