    "abstract": "Disagreements are common in online discussions. Disagreement may foster collaboration and improve the quality of a discussion under some conditions. Although there exist methods for recognizing disagreement, a deeper understanding of factors that influence disagreement is lacking in the literature. We investigate a hypothesis that differences in personal values are indicative of disagreement in online discussions. We show how state-of-the-art models can be used for estimating values in online discussions and how the estimated values can be aggregated into value profiles. We evaluate the estimated value profiles based on human-annotated agreement labels. We find that the dissimilarity of value profiles correlates with disagreement in specific cases. We also find that including value information in agreement prediction improves performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "在线讨论中的分歧是很常见的，然而在现有文献中对影响分歧的因素缺乏深入的理解。本研究探讨了个人价值观差异是否与在线讨论中的分歧有关。我们使用先进的模型估计了在线讨论中的价值观，并将估计值聚合为价值观配置文件。通过人工标注的一致性标签对估计的价值观配置文件进行评估。我们发现在特定情况下，价值观配置文件的不相似性与分歧有关。同时发现在一致性预测中加入价值信息可以提高性能。",
