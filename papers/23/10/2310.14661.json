    "translated_abstract": "后验采样即从后验分布中采样的指数机制，提供ε-纯差分隐私（DP）保证，并不受（ε，δ）-近似DP引入的潜在无界隐私泄漏的影响。然而，在实践中，需要应用近似采样方法，如马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC），从而重新引入了对隐私保证的δ-近似误差。为了弥合这一差距，我们提出了近似采样扰动（即ASAP）算法，该算法通过与满足纯DP或纯高斯DP（即δ=0）的参考分布有界Wasserstein无穷距离的MCMC样本加噪声。然后利用Metropolis-Hastings算法生成样本并证明算法在W$_\\infty$距离上收敛。我们展示了通过将我们的新技术与细致的局部化步骤相结合，我们获得了第一个可计算MCMC私有学习方法。",
