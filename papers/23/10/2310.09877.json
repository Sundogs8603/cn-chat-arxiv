    "translated_abstract": "积累的局部效应（ALE）是一种对黑盒机器学习（ML）算法结果进行全局解释的模型无关方法。使用ALE进行统计推断面临至少三个挑战：确保ALE分析的可靠性，尤其在小数据集的情况下；直观地表征变量在ML中的整体效应；以及从ML数据分析中进行健壮的推断。为此，我们引入了创新的工具和技术，使用ALE进行统计推断，建立了适应数据集大小的自助法置信区间，并引入了直观指示对结果变量和标准化尺度上的效应的ALE效应大小度量。此外，我们演示了如何使用这些工具绘制可靠的统计推断，反映了ALE熟练突出的灵活模式，实现了R中“ale”包中的实现。这项工作推动了关于ALE及其应用的讨论。",
