    "abstract": "Multi-hop Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) is a task that involves retrieving nodes from a knowledge graph (KG) to answer natural language questions. Recent GNN-based approaches formulate this task as a KG path searching problem, where messages are sequentially propagated from the seed node towards the answer nodes. However, these messages are past-oriented, and they do not consider the full KG context. To make matters worse, KG nodes often represent proper noun entities and are sometimes encrypted, being uninformative in selecting between paths. To address these problems, we propose Neural Tree Search (NuTrea), a tree search-based GNN model that incorporates the broader KG context. Our model adopts a message-passing scheme that probes the unreached subtree regions to boost the past-oriented embeddings. In addition, we introduce the Relation Frequency-Inverse Entity Frequency (RF-IEF) node embedding that considers the global KG context to better characterize ambiguous KG nodes",

    "translated_abstract": "多跳的知识图问答是一项任务，涉及从知识图中检索节点以回答自然语言问题。最近基于GNN的方法将此任务形式化为一个知识图路径搜索问题，其中消息从种子节点沿着路径依次传播到答案节点。然而，这些消息都是过去导向的，并没有考虑到完整的知识图上下文。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种基于树搜索的GNN模型NuTrea，它将更广泛的知识图上下文纳入考虑。我们的模型采用了消息传递方案，探索未到达的子树区域以提升过去导向的嵌入。此外，我们还引入了关系频率-逆实体频率（RF-IEF）节点嵌入，以更好地表征模糊的知识图节点。",
