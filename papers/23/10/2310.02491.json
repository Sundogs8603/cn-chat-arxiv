    "translated_abstract": "深度操作器网络（DeepONets, DONs）在能够训练多分辨率数据方面相比传统神经网络具有独特优势。在现实世界的场景中，高分辨率的测量数据往往难以获得，而低分辨率的数据更容易获得，这个特性尤为重要。然而，仅凭DeepONets往往难以捕捉和保持长序列的相关性，与其他最先进的算法相比。我们提出了一种新的架构，命名为DON-LSTM，它将DeepONet与长短期记忆网络（LSTM）结合起来。通过结合这两种架构，我们赋予网络明确的机制来利用多分辨率数据，并捕捉长序列的时间依赖性。我们在多个非线性系统的长时间演化建模方面测试了我们的方法，并展示了所提出的多分辨率DON-LSTM实现了显著较低的泛化误差，并且需要较少的高分辨率数据。",
