    "translated_abstract": "医学视觉-语言预训练(VLP)从医学图像和配对的放射学报告中联合学习表示。它通常需要大规模的图像-文本配对数据集，以实现图像编码器和文本编码器的有效预训练。文本引导生成模型的出现引发了一个引人注目的问题：是否可以仅使用从真实放射学报告中生成的合成图像来实现VLP，从而减轻了对大量配对和筛选图像-文本数据集的需要？在这项工作中，我们通过检查使用合成图像进行医学VLP的可行性和有效性来审查这个问题。我们用真实医学报告生成的合成图像替换真实医学图像。我们使用三种最先进的VLP算法专门在这些合成样本上进行训练。我们的经验评估涵盖了三个连续任务，即图像分类、语义分割和目标检测。",
