    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly concerning unintentional generation of harmful and toxic responses. While the traditional alignment methods strive to steer LLMs towards desired performance and shield them from malicious content, this study proposes a novel alignment strategy rooted in mistake analysis by exposing LLMs to flawed outputs purposefully and then conducting a thorough assessment to fully comprehend internal reasons via natural language analysis. Thus, toxic responses can be transformed into instruction tuning corpus for model alignment, and LLMs can not only be deterred from generating flawed responses but also trained to self-criticize, leveraging its innate ability to discriminate toxic content. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional alignment techniques for safety instruction following, while maintaining superior efficiency.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展既带来了机遇，也带来了挑战，特别是在意外生成有害和有毒回应方面。传统的对齐方法致力于引导LLMs朝着期望的性能发展并保护它们免受恶意内容的侵害，而本研究提出了一种基于错误分析的全新对齐策略，通过有意暴露LLMs的缺陷输出并进行深入评估，以完全理解内部原因，通过自然语言分析。因此，有毒回应可以转化为模型对齐的指导调谐语料，LLMs不仅可以避免生成有缺陷的回应，还可以训练其进行自我批评，发挥其辨别有毒内容的内在能力。实验结果表明，所提出的方法在安全指令遵循方面优于传统的对齐技术，同时还保持了卓越的效率。",
