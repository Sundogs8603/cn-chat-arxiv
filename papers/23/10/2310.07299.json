    "translated_abstract": "语法错误修正（GEC）系统在帮助人们日常写作任务中起到了至关重要的作用。然而，用户有时可能会遇到一些初始表现良好但遇到输入微小修改时无法修正错误的GEC系统。为了确保理想的用户体验，可靠的GEC系统应能够在遇到无关上下文扰动时提供一致且准确的建议，我们称之为上下文鲁棒性。在本文中，我们引入了RobustGEC，这是一个用于评估GEC系统上下文鲁棒性的基准测试。RobustGEC包含5,000个GEC案例，每个案例由一句原始的错误-修正句子对和由人工标注者精心设计的五个变体组成。利用RobustGEC，我们揭示了目前最先进的GEC系统在面对上下文扰动时仍然缺乏足够的鲁棒性。此外，我们提出了一种简单而有效的方法来解决这个问题。",
