    "translated_abstract": "边缘设备与云的结合提供了两类设备之间的协作关系，彼此之间互补优势。资源受限的边缘设备可以通过将计算密集型任务卸载到服务器上，从服务器提供的丰富计算能力中获益。同时，边缘设备可以利用其接近数据源的优势，在数据上执行较少计算密集型的任务。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为ECAvg的协同边缘-云范式，在该范式中，边缘设备在各自的数据集上预训练本地模型，并将模型转移到服务器进行微调。服务器将预训练的权重平均为一个全局模型，该模型在来自不同边缘设备的组合数据上进行微调。然后，使用全局模型的权重更新本地（边缘）模型。我们使用MobileNetV2实现了CIFAR-10分类任务，并使用ResN（待完成）",
