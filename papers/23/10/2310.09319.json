We perform a rigorous and reproducible literature search of applications of TDA on the setting of industrial production and manufacturing. The resulting works are clustered and analyzed based on their application area within the manufacturing process and their input data type. We highlight the key benefits of TDA and their tools in this area and describe its challenges, as well as future potential. Finally, we discuss which TDA methods are underutilized in (the specific area of) industry and the identified types of application, with the goal of prompting more research in this ",
