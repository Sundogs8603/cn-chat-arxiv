    "abstract": "Simulation-based inference has been popular for amortized Bayesian computation. It is typical to have more than one posterior approximation, from different inference algorithms, different architectures, or simply the randomness of initialization and stochastic gradients. With a provable asymptotic guarantee, we present a general stacking framework to make use of all available posterior approximations. Our stacking method is able to combine densities, simulation draws, confidence intervals, and moments, and address the overall precision, calibration, coverage, and bias at the same time. We illustrate our method on several benchmark simulations and a challenging cosmological inference task.",
