    "translated_abstract": "嵌入在现代推荐系统中起着关键作用，因为它们是真实世界实体的虚拟表示，并且是后续决策模型的基础。本文提出了一种新颖的嵌入更新机制，称为结构感知嵌入演化(SEvo)，以鼓励相关节点在每一步中以类似的方式演化。与通常作为中间部分的GNN（图神经网络）不同，SEvo能够直接将图结构信息注入到嵌入中，且在训练过程中计算开销可忽略。本文通过理论分析验证了SEvo的收敛性质及其可能的改进版本，以证明设计的有效性。此外，SEvo可以无缝集成到现有的优化器中，以实现最先进性能。特别是，在矩估计校正的SEvo增强AdamW中，证明了一致的改进效果在多种模型和数据集上，为有效推荐了一种新的技术路线。",
