A recently proposed iterated EM scheme yields an inner approximation of those bounds by sampling the initialisation parameters. Such a method requires multiple (Bayesian network) queries over models sharing the same structural equations and topology, but different exogenous probabilities. This setup makes a compilation of the underlying model to an arithmetic circuit advantageous, thus inducing a sizeable inferential speed-up. We show how a single symbolic knowledge compilation allows us to obtain the circuit structure with symbolic parameters to be replaced by their actual values when computing the different queries. We also discuss parallelisation techniques to further speed up the bound computation. Experiments against standard Bayesian network inference show clear computational advantages with up to an order of magnitude of speed-up.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们讨论了在皮尔斯结构性因果模型中限制部分可识别查询（例如反事实）的问题。最近提出的迭代EM方案通过对初始化参数进行采样来获得这些界限的内部近似。这种方法需要对共享相同结构方程和拓扑结构但具有不同外生概率的模型进行多个（贝叶斯网络）查询。这种设置使得将底层模型编译为算术电路变得有利，从而实现了可观的推理加速。我们展示了如何通过单一的符号知识编译来获得电路结构，并在计算不同查询时用实际值替换符号参数。我们还讨论了进一步加速界限计算的并行化技术。与标准贝叶斯网络推理相比，实验证明了明显的计算优势，具有高达一个数量级的加速。",
