    "translated_abstract": "情绪人工智能当前是人工智能领域最受期待的发展之一。如果成功，这些人工智能将被归类为最复杂、最智能的非人类实体，因为它们将具备感知能力，这是区分生物人类和机械机器人的主要因素之一。为了被归类为“有情感”的人工智能，它们应该能够与他人产生共情并分类他们的情绪，因为没有这些能力，它们无法正常与人类互动。本研究调查了卷积神经网络模型识别和分类人类面部表情（积极、中性、消极）的能力。本研究使用Python编写了CNN模型，并使用芝加哥面部数据库的预处理数据进行训练。模型故意设计得较简单，以进一步研究其能力。我们假设该模型在分类输入数据的每个情感类别时将比随机猜测（33.3%）表现更好。模型的准确性通过n进行测试。",
