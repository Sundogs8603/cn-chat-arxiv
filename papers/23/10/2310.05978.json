    "abstract": "Online social networks usage has increased significantly in the last decade and continues to grow in popularity. Multiple social platforms use volunteers as a central component. The behavior of volunteers in volunteer-based networks has been studied extensively in recent years. Here, we explore the development of volunteer-based social networks, primarily focusing on their key users' behaviors and activities. We developed two novel algorithms: the first reveals key user behavior patterns over time; the second utilizes machine learning methods to generate a forecasting model that can predict the future behavior of key users, including whether they will remain active donors or change their behavior to become mainly recipients, and vice-versa. These algorithms allowed us to analyze the factors that significantly influence behavior predictions.  To evaluate our algorithms, we utilized data from over 2.4 million users on a peer-to-peer food-sharing online platform. Using our algorithm, we i",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去十年中，在线社交网络的使用量显著增加并持续流行。多个社交平台将志愿者作为核心组成部分。近年来，志愿者行为在志愿者网络中得到了广泛研究。本文主要探讨志愿者社交网络的发展，重点关注关键用户的行为和活动。我们开发了两个新算法：第一个算法揭示了关键用户随时间的行为模式；第二个算法利用机器学习方法生成预测模型，可以预测关键用户的未来行为，包括是否保持活跃捐赠者身份或改变行为成为主要接受者，反之亦然。这些算法使我们能够分析对行为预测产生显著影响的因素。我们利用来自一个P2P食品分享在线平台的240万用户数据来评估我们的算法。利用我们的算法，我们从中提取出关键用户的行为趋势。",
