    "translated_abstract": "分子表示学习在药物发现和酶设计等众多生物化学应用中已经证明具有重要影响力。然而，现有的工作往往忽略了分子的灵活性，分子通过化学键旋转和微小振动扰动不断在构象之间相互转化。为了更好地考虑分子的灵活性，最近的一些工作将分子表示学习定义为一个集合学习问题，专注于从一组构象结构中明确学习。然而，大多数研究在数据集、任务和模型方面存在局限性。在本研究中，我们引入了第一个MoleculAR Conformer Ensemble Learning（MARCEL）基准测试，以全面评估在构象集合上学习的潜力，并提出有前途的研究方向。MARCEL包括四个数据集，涵盖了多样的分子和反应水平信息。",
