    "translated_abstract": "一致性模型（CM）加速基于得分的扩散模型采样，但以牺牲样本质量为代价，缺乏一种自然的方法来权衡速度和质量。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一致性轨迹模型（CTM），它是包括CM和基于得分模型在内的泛化模型。CTM训练一个单一的神经网络，可以在单次前向传递中输出得分（即对数密度的梯度），并允许在扩散过程中任意初始和最终时间之间进行不受限制的遍历概率流普通微分方程（ODE）。CTM利用对抗训练和去噪得分匹配损失的有效组合来提高性能，并在CIFAR-10（FID 1.73）和64X64分辨率的ImageNet上实现新的最先进FID。CTM还实现了一系列新的采样方案，包括确定性和随机的ODE解中的长跳跃。",
