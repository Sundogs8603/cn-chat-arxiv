    "abstract": "Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities across a range of tasks. Questions, however, persist about the nature of LLMs and their potential to integrate common-sense human knowledge when performing tasks involving information about the real physical world. This paper delves into these questions by exploring how LLMs can be extended to interact with and reason about the physical world through IoT sensors and actuators, a concept that we term \"Penetrative AI\". The paper explores such an extension at two levels of LLMs' ability to penetrate into the physical world via the processing of sensory signals. Our preliminary findings indicate that LLMs, with ChatGPT being the representative example in our exploration, have considerable and unique proficiency in employing the embedded world knowledge for interpreting IoT sensor data and reasoning over them about tasks in the physical realm. Not only this opens up new applications for LLMs ",

    "translated_abstract": "最近大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展展示了它们在各种任务中的显著能力。然而，关于LLMs的性质以及它们在涉及真实物理世界信息的任务中整合常识人类知识的潜力仍存在疑问。本文通过探索LLMs如何通过物联网传感器和执行器与物理世界进行交互和推理来探讨这些问题，这一概念称为“渗透式人工智能”。论文在LLMs能够透过处理感知信号的两个层面上探索了这种扩展。我们的初步研究结果表明，LLMs（ChatGPT是我们研究中的代表性例子）在应用内嵌的世界知识解释物联网传感器数据并对物理领域的任务进行推理方面具有相当独特的能力。这不仅为LLMs开辟了新的应用领域。",
