    "abstract": "Data Augmentation (DA) has emerged as an indispensable strategy in Time Series Classification (TSC), primarily due to its capacity to amplify training samples, thereby bolstering model robustness, diversifying datasets, and curtailing overfitting. However, the current landscape of DA in TSC is plagued with fragmented literature reviews, nebulous methodological taxonomies, inadequate evaluative measures, and a dearth of accessible, user-oriented tools. In light of these challenges, this study embarks on an exhaustive dissection of DA methodologies within the TSC realm. Our initial approach involved an extensive literature review spanning a decade, revealing that contemporary surveys scarcely capture the breadth of advancements in DA for TSC, prompting us to meticulously analyze over 100 scholarly articles to distill more than 60 unique DA techniques. This rigorous analysis precipitated the formulation of a novel taxonomy, purpose-built for the intricacies of DA in TSC, categorizing tech",

    "translated_abstract": "数据增强（DA）已成为时间序列分类（TSC）中不可或缺的策略，主要因为它可以增加训练样本的数量，从而提高模型的健壮性，使数据集多样化，并减少过拟合。然而，目前TSC中的DA研究存在着文献评审的片段化，方法学分类不清晰，评估指标不足以及缺乏用户友好的工具等问题。鉴于这些挑战，本研究对TSC领域中的DA方法进行了详尽的研究。我们首先进行了持续十年的广泛文献回顾，发现当代综述文章很少能够涵盖DA在TSC上的全部进展，因此我们仔细分析了100多篇学术文章，总结出了60多种独特的DA技术。这项严格的分析形成了一种新颖的分类体系，专门针对TSC中的DA细节进行分类。",
