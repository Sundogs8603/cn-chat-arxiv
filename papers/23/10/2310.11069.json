    "abstract": "Arabic is a complex language with many varieties and dialects spoken by over 450 millions all around the world. Due to the linguistic diversity and variations, it is challenging to build a robust and generalized ASR system for Arabic. In this work, we address this gap by developing and demoing a system, dubbed VoxArabica, for dialect identification (DID) as well as automatic speech recognition (ASR) of Arabic. We train a wide range of models such as HuBERT (DID), Whisper, and XLS-R (ASR) in a supervised setting for Arabic DID and ASR tasks. Our DID models are trained to identify 17 different dialects in addition to MSA. We finetune our ASR models on MSA, Egyptian, Moroccan, and mixed data. Additionally, for the remaining dialects in ASR, we provide the option to choose various models such as Whisper and MMS in a zero-shot setting. We integrate these models into a single web interface with diverse features such as audio recording, file upload, model selection, and the option to raise fl",

    "translated_abstract": "阿拉伯语是一种复杂的语言，全球有超过4.5亿人口使用许多不同的方言和口音。由于语言的多样性和变化，为阿拉伯语构建一个稳健且通用的语音识别系统具有挑战性。在这项工作中，我们通过开发和演示一个名为VoxArabica的系统，解决了这个问题，用于方言识别(DID)和阿拉伯语自动语音识别(ASR)。我们在监督环境下训练了各种模型，例如HuBERT(DID)、Whisper和XLS-R(ASR)，用于阿拉伯语的DID和ASR任务。我们的DID模型被训练用于识别除了标准阿拉伯之外的17种不同的方言。我们在标准阿拉伯语(MSA)、埃及语、摩洛哥语和混合数据上微调我们的ASR模型。此外，对于ASR中的其他方言，我们提供了Whisper和MMS等不同模型的选择。我们将这些模型集成到一个单一的网络界面中，具有多样的功能，如音频录制、上传文件、模型选择和提出问题的选项。",
