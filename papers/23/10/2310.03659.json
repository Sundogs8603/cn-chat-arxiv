    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）已经彻底改变了人工智能领域，赋予其复杂的语言理解和生成能力。然而，当面对更复杂和相互连接的任务时，需要深入和迭代的思考过程，LLMs显露出其固有的局限性。自治LLM驱动的多智能体系统是对这些挑战的战略性回应。这样的系统通过将用户提示的目标分解为可管理的任务，并通过一组专门的智能体协调执行和结果综合，努力实现自主地解决这些目标。这些智能体配备了LLM驱动的推理能力，通过利用上下文资源（如工具和数据集），增强与同伴合作的认知协同效应。虽然这些架构在增强人工智能能力方面具有潜在的潜力，但在不同层次的自主性和一致性之间找到正确的平衡是关键。",
