    "translated_abstract": "机器学习工具通常依赖于将文本嵌入为实数向量。本文研究了语义结构如何在这些嵌入的代数结构中被编码。具体而言，我们研究了一个称为“语义独立性”的概念，该概念捕捉了“茄子”和“西红柿”相对于“蔬菜”的独立性。尽管这样的例子很直观，但很难形式化这样的语义独立性概念。关键观察是，任何合理的形式化都应遵守一组所谓的独立性公理，因此任何代数编码这种结构的方法也应遵守这些公理。这自然地导致我们使用部分正交性作为相关的代数结构。我们开发了理论和方法，可以证明部分正交性确实捕捉到了语义独立性。此外，我们还引入了保持独立性的嵌入概念，其中嵌入保持了独立性。",
