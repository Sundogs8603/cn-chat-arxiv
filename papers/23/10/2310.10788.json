    "translated_abstract": "基于自我监督学习（SSL）的语音模型在许多下游任务中显示出了出色的性能。这些最先进的模型一直是黑匣子，但最近的许多研究开始对像HuBERT这样的模型进行\"探测\"，以将其内部表示与语音的不同方面相关联。本文中，我们展示了自我监督模型的一个基本属性，即\"推断发音运动学\"，即这些模型将声学转化为语音信号底层的因果性发音动态的能力。我们还显示出，该抽象在用于训练模型的数据的语言之间有较大的重叠，在类似音系的语言中有更高的偏好。此外，我们还显示出，通过简单的仿射变换，声学到发音的逆转换（AAI）在说话者之间具有可传递性，甚至在性别、语言和方言之间也具有可传递性，显示了该属性的普适性。总的来说，这些结果为我们对语音处理的认识提供了新的视角。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper demonstrates the ability of self-supervised speech models to infer articulatory kinematics and shows the overlapping nature of this property across different languages. Moreover, the models exhibit good generalizability by successfully transferring across speakers, genders, languages, and dialects with simple transformations. These findings offer new insights into speech processing."
