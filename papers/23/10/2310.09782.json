    "translated_abstract": "在一个通用的框架中，把任何市场系统表达为状态转换规则，我们证明了每个DeFi市场系统都有一个不变量；事实上，所有的AMMs都是CFMMs。不变量与套利和完备性直接相关，基于两个基本等价性。首先，我们证明，DeFi市场系统无套利当且仅当它有一个严格递增的不变量，其中无套利意味着任何一系列的交易都不能将一个状态转换为一个被支配的状态。其次，我们证明，如果市场系统是完备的，即至少在一个方向上允许所有状态对之间的转换，那么不变量是唯一的。因此，无套利 (或者完备性) 的一个必要条件是递增 (或者唯一性) 不变量的存在，因此在非线性的DeFi理论中，不变量在存在性 (或者唯一性) 上具有基础性的作用。",
