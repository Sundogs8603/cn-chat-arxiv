However, the resulting models still rely on pre-trained knowledge graph embeddings, fail to fully exploit the interdependence between entities and relations in the KG for recommendation, and may generate inaccurate explanations. In this paper, we introduce PEARLM, a novel approach that efficiently captures user behaviour and product-side knowledge through language modelling. With our approach, knowledge graph embeddings are directly learned from paths over the KG by the language model, which also unifies entities and relations in the same optimisation space. Constraints on the sequence decoding additionally guarantee path faithfulness with respect to the KG.

    "translated_abstract": "针对知识图谱中的路径推理方法在提高推荐系统透明度方面的潜力，本文提出了一种名为PEARLM的新方法，该方法通过语言建模有效捕获用户行为和产品端知识。我们的方法通过语言模型直接从知识图谱上的路径中学习知识图谱嵌入，并将实体和关系统一在同一优化空间中。序列解码的约束保证了路径对知识图谱的忠实性。在两个数据集上的实验证明了我们方法与现有最先进方法的有效性。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一个名为PEARLM的方法，通过语言建模开展基于路径的知识图谱推荐，解决了现有方法中对预训练知识图谱嵌入的依赖以及未充分利用实体和关系之间相互依赖性的问题，还避免了生成不准确的解释。实验结果表明，与现有方法相比，我们的方法效果显著。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces PEARLM, an approach that utilizes language modeling to perform path-based recommendation over knowledge graphs. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by directly learning knowledge graph embeddings from paths, exploiting the interdependence between entities and relations, and ensuring faithful explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
