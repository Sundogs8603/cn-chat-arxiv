    "translated_abstract": "近年来，将神经网络与局部搜索启发式相结合已经在组合优化领域变得流行。尽管这种方法需要相当大的计算需求，但它在最小的人工工程投入下展现出了很有希望的结果。然而，我们发现了这些整合尝试的实证评估中存在三个关键限制。首先，中等复杂性和弱基线的情况在准确评估基于学习的方法的有效性时是一个挑战。其次，缺乏消融研究使得准确地量化和归因于深度学习架构的改进变得困难。最后，在不同分布下学习启发式的泛化性仍未被充分探索。在这项研究中，我们对这些被识别出的限制进行了全面的调查。令人惊讶的是，我们证明了基于禁忌搜索的简单学习启发式超越了最先进的学习启发式方法。",
