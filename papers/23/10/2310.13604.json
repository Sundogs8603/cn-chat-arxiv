    "translated_abstract": "早期发现可以治疗的危险性皮肤癌症类型——黑色素瘤。为了通过自动皮肤病变分割协助诊断，提出了各种使用全卷积网络（FCNs）的方法，其中突出的是U-Net架构。然而，对卷积操作的依赖使得对准确医学图像分割至关重要的长程依赖的捕捉能力受到限制。近期创建了几种基于Transformer的U-Net拓扑结构，通过将CNN块替换为不同的Transformer模块来捕捉局部和全局表示。此外，编码器和解码器之间的语义差距限制了U型结构的效果。本研究旨在通过精心构建跳过连接路径，增加网络特征的可重用性。在跳过连接路径中整合已计算的注意力亲和性可以提高网络性能。",
