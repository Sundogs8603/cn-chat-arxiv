    "translated_abstract": "准确高效的船只吃水读数（VDR）是智能海上监控的重要组成部分，可以用来判断船只是否正常装载或过载。计算机视觉技术具有良好的性价比，已成为估计船只吃水深度的流行方法。然而，传统的估计方法容易受到多种限制的影响，如对低质量图像的敏感性，高计算成本等。本文提出了一种多任务学习启用的计算方法（称为MTL-VDR），用于生成高可靠的VDR。特别地，我们的MTL-VDR主要包括四个组成部分，即吃水标志检测，吃水尺度识别，船体/水域分割和最终吃水深度估计。我们首先构建与吃水标志检测相关的基准数据集，并采用强大高效的卷积神经网络来准确执行检测任务。",
