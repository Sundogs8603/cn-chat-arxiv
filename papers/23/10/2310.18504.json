This approach requires a mean treatment change and causal interpretation requires the LATE-type monotonicity in the first stage. An alternative approach is to explore distributional changes in the treatment, where the first-stage restriction is treatment rank similarity. We propose causal estimands that are doubly robust in that they are valid under either of these two restrictions. We apply the doubly robust estimation to estimate the impacts of sleep on well-being. Our results corroborate the usual 2SLS estimates.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多实证研究估计使用二进制仪器处理的连续内生变量（处理）的因果效应。通常通过线性2SLS进行估计。这种方法需要处理变化的平均值，并且因果解释需要第一阶段的LATE型单调性。替代方法是探索处理的分布变化，其中第一阶段的限制是处理的等级相似性。我们提出一种双重鲁棒性的因果估计，它们在这两个限制下都是有效的。我们应用双重鲁棒估计来估计睡眠对幸福感的影响。我们的结果支持通常的2SLS估计。",

The results demonstrate that this method yields similar estimates to traditional 2SLS estimation when estimating the impact of sleep on well-being."
