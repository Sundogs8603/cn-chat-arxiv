    "translated_abstract": "量子计算在解决一些问题时有巨大潜力，但对其他问题几乎没有任何帮助。对于希望现在或将来使用量子计算机的人来说，了解哪些问题将会受益很重要。本文介绍了一个直观和定量回答这个问题的框架。该框架的基本结构是量子计算机和经典计算机之间的比赛，它们的相对优势决定了谁会胜出。虽然经典计算机运行速度更快，但量子计算机有时可以运行更高效的算法。速度优势还是算法优势的占主导地位将决定一个问题是否会从量子计算中受益。我们的分析显示，许多问题，特别是那些规模较小但对于典型企业很重要的问题，将不会从量子计算中受益。相反，规模较大或具有特别大的算法收益的问题将会从量子计算中受益。",
