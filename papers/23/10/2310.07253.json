This study proposes a novel benchmark ADMEOOD, a systematic OOD dataset curator and benchmark specifically designed for drug property prediction. ADMEOOD obtained 27 ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion) drug properties from Chembl and relevant literature. Additionally, it includes two kinds of OOD data shifts: Noise Shift and Concept Conflict Drift (CCD). Noise Shift responds to the noise level by categorizing the environment into different confidence levels. On the other hand, CCD describes the data which has inconsistent label among the original data. Finall",

    "translated_abstract": "获得准确有效的药物分子信息是一项关键而具有挑战性的任务。然而，过去100年来，化学知识和信息来自不同地区、实验室和实验目的的积累。在超分布（OOD）问题中，噪音和不一致性很少被探索，这可能导致弱鲁棒性和不满意的性能。本研究提出了一个新的基准ADMEOOD, 一个特别设计用于药物属性预测的系统超分布数据集策划者和基准。ADMEOOD从Chembl和相关文献中获得了27个药物属性。另外，它还包括两种超分布数据转移：噪声转移和概念冲突漂移（CCD）。噪声转移通过将环境分类为不同的置信水平来响应噪声水平。另一方面，CCD描述了原始数据中标签不一致的数据。",
