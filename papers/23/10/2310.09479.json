    "translated_abstract": "深度学习技术已经实现了许多无条件图像生成(UIG)模型，如GAN、扩散模型等。这些模型产生的极其逼真的图像（也称为AI生成内容，简称AIGC）对知识产权保护，如数据可追溯性和版权认证，带来了紧迫需求。攻击者可以窃取目标模型的输出图像，并将其作为训练数据的一部分来训练一个私有替代UIG模型。UIG模型的实现机制多样复杂，目前还没有统一有效的保护和验证方法。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种具有高绑定效果的两阶段统一水印验证机制，用于此类模型。在第一阶段，我们使用一个编码器将水印图像隐形地写入原始AIGC工具的输出图像中，并通过相应的解码器逆向提取水印图像。在第二阶段，",
