    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型是一类生成模型，在图像合成、视频生成和分子设计等任务中取得了创纪录的性能。尽管具备这些能力，但其效率，特别是在逆向去噪过程中，仍然面临着慢收敛速度和高计算成本的挑战。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种利用连续动力系统来设计扩散模型的新型去噪网络的方法，该方法更具参数效率，收敛速度更快，并且具有更高的噪声稳健性。通过对去噪概率扩散模型进行实验，我们的框架使用的参数约为标准去噪概率扩散模型（DDPM）中标准U-Net的四分之一，浮点运算（FLOPs）约为标准U-Net的30%。此外，在相等条件下测量时，我们的模型的推理速度比基准模型快70％，同时收敛到更好的质量解。",
