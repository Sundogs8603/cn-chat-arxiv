    "translated_abstract": "密集嵌入式检索现已成为语义搜索和排名问题的行业标准，如获取给定查询的相关网络文档。这些技术使用了两个阶段的过程：(a)对比学习来训练双编码器以嵌入查询和文档，以及(b)近似最近邻搜索(ANNS)以查找给定查询的相似文档。这两个阶段是不相交的；学得的嵌入可能不适合ANNS方法，反之亦然，导致性能不佳。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为端到端层次索引(EHI)的方法，它同时学习嵌入和ANNS结构以优化检索性能。EHI使用标准的双编码器模型来嵌入查询和文档，同时学习一个倒排文件索引(IVF)风格的树状结构以实现高效的ANNS。为了确保离散基于树的ANNS结构的稳定和高效学习，EHI引入了密集路径嵌入的概念，用来捕获索引的语义信息。",
