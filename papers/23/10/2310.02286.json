    "abstract": "The field of Optimal Control under Partial Differential Equations (PDE) constraints is rapidly changing under the influence of Deep Learning and the accompanying automatic differentiation libraries. Novel techniques like Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Differentiable Programming (DP) are to be contrasted with established numerical schemes like Direct-Adjoint Looping (DAL). We present a comprehensive comparison of DAL, PINN, and DP using a general-purpose mesh-free differentiable PDE solver based on Radial Basis Functions. Under Laplace and Navier-Stokes equations, we found DP to be extremely effective as it produces the most accurate gradients; thriving even when DAL fails and PINNs struggle. Additionally, we provide a detailed benchmark highlighting the limited conditions under which any of those methods can be efficiently used. Our work provides a guide to Optimal Control practitioners and connects them further to the Deep Learning community.",

    "translated_abstract": "在深度学习和自动微分库的影响下，偏微分方程约束下的最优控制领域正在迅速变化。我们对直接-伴随循环(DAL)、物理感知神经网络(PINN)和可微分编程(DP)进行了全面比较，使用基于径向基函数的通用无网格可微分PDE求解器。在拉普拉斯和纳维-斯托克斯方程下，我们发现DP非常有效，因为它产生了最准确的梯度，即使DAL失败和PINN困难。此外，我们提供了一个详细的基准，突出了这些方法在哪些条件下可以有效使用。我们的工作为最优控制从业者提供了指南，并进一步连接了他们与深度学习社区。",
