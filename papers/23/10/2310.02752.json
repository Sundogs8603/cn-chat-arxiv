    "translated_abstract": "机器学习分类器被广泛用于做出对人们生活影响重大的决策（如接受或拒绝贷款、招聘决策等）。在这些应用中，学习到的分类器需要在不同人群（性别、种族等不同变量值）之间既准确又公平。本文侧重于公平特征选择，即选择一个特征子集，旨在最大化分类器所做预测的准确性和公平性。具体而言，我们比较了最近提出的两种用于公平特征选择的遗传算法：（a）基于帕累托优势的遗传算法；（b）基于词典优化的遗传算法，其中准确性的最大化优先级高于公平性的最大化。两种遗传算法使用相同的准确性和公平性指标，可以进行控制比较。据我们所知，这是第一项比较两种不同多目标优化方法的公平特征选择遗传算法的研究。",
