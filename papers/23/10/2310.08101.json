    "translated_abstract": "在我们日常数字交互中，文本输入是一项重要的任务。为了使文本输入更有效、高效和流畅，已经开发出了许多智能功能，包括句子预测和用户个性化。然而，随着基于深度学习的语言模型成为这些高级功能的常规，数据收集和模型微调的必要性也增加了。利用GPT-3.5等大型语言模型的上下文学习能力可以减轻这些挑战。这一独特的特性允许语言模型通过提示获得新的技能，消除了数据收集和微调的需要。因此，大型语言模型可以学习各种文本预测技术。我们最初展示了仅通过提示GPT-3.5即可超过GPT-2支持的系统，并且与经过精调的GPT-3.5模型相当，在后两种方法需要昂贵的数据集的情况下。",

By leveraging the in-context learning capability of large language models, it overcomes the challenges of data collection and model fine-tuning. Our experiments using GPT-3.5 demonstrate that simple prompting can outperform GPT-2 backed systems and achieve comparable performance to fine-tuned GPT-3.5 models."
