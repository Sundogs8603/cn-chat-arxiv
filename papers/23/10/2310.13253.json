    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统领域一直致力于通过利用用户的历史交互来提高准确性。然而，这种追求准确性的同时往往导致了多样性的降低，从而产生了众所周知的“回声室”现象。多样化推荐系统作为一种对策应运而生，将多样性与准确性同等看待，并在学术界和行业实践者中获得了显著的关注。本研究探索了多样化推荐系统在复杂的知识图谱（KG）背景下的应用。这些知识图谱是连接实体和项目的信息库，通过加入深入的上下文信息，提供了增加推荐多样性的有利途径。我们的贡献包括引入了一种创新的度量标准，实体覆盖和关系覆盖，有效地量化了知识图谱领域的多样性。此外，我们还引入了多样化评分函数，该函数通过综合利用实体覆盖和关系覆盖来提高推荐算法的多样性。",
