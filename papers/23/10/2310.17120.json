    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言处理中，将文档或对话根据其语义结构分解为多个连续片段是一个重要且具有挑战性的问题，可以帮助许多下游任务。然而，当前关于主题分段的研究往往集中在结构化文本的分段上。在本文中，我们全面分析了最先进的主题分段模型在非结构化文本上的泛化能力。我们发现：（a）目前在大规模结构化文本语料库（如Wiki-727K）上进行预训练的策略对于在非结构化对话数据上的可传递性并不有帮助。（b）从头开始使用相对小规模的目标非结构化领域数据集训练能显著提高分段结果。我们通过尝试多种损失函数来进行我们的主题分段方法的强化测试，以减轻非结构化对话数据集的不平衡效应。我们的实证评估表明Fo",
