Concretely, we employ hierarchical reinforcement learning to combine a sequence of learned parameterized manipulation primitives. By learning the low-level manipulation policies, our approach can control the object's state through exploiting interactions between the object, the gripper, and the environment. Designing such a complex behavior analytically would be infeasible under uncontrolled conditions, as an analytic approach requires accurate physical modeling of the interaction and contact dynamics.

    "translated_abstract": "许多实际相关的机器人抓取问题都涉及到目标物体，其所有抓取都被环境遮挡。在这种情况下，单次抓取计划总是失败的。因此，有必要首先将物体操作到一个适合进行抓取的配置。我们通过学习一系列利用环境改变物体姿态的动作来解决这个问题。具体而言，我们利用分层强化学习来结合一系列学习到的参数化操作原语。通过学习低级操作策略，我们的方法可以通过利用物体、夹具和环境之间的相互作用来控制物体的状态。在无控制条件下分析设计这样一个复杂行为是不可行的，因为分析方法需要准确建模互动和接触动力学。相反，我们学习一个在深度图像上直接操作的分层策略模型。",
