    "translated_abstract": "最近，在机器学习中，模型相对于群作用的等变性已成为一个重要的研究课题。然而，赋予一个架构具体的群等变性对模型所期望看到的数据变换类型施加了强大的先验。严格等变模型强制执行对称性，但真实世界的数据并不总是符合这样的严格等变性，可能是因为数据中的噪声或仅编码了近似或部分对称性的潜在物理定律。在这种情况下，严格等变性的先验实际上可能过于强大，导致模型在真实数据上表现不佳。因此，在这项工作中，我们研究了一个相关的主题，即几乎等变性。我们提供了一个与当前文献中现有定义不同的几乎等变性定义，并通过利用李群的李代数给出了在模型中编码几乎等变性的实用方法。",
