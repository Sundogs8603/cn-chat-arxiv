    "abstract": "Deep learning models are susceptible to adversarial samples in white and black-box environments. Although previous studies have shown high attack success rates, coupling DNN models with interpretation models could offer a sense of security when a human expert is involved, who can identify whether a given sample is benign or malicious. However, in white-box environments, interpretable deep learning systems (IDLSes) have been shown to be vulnerable to malicious manipulations. In black-box settings, as access to the components of IDLSes is limited, it becomes more challenging for the adversary to fool the system. In this work, we propose a Query-efficient Score-based black-box attack against IDLSes, QuScore, which requires no knowledge of the target model and its coupled interpretation model. QuScore is based on transfer-based and score-based methods by employing an effective microbial genetic algorithm. Our method is designed to reduce the number of queries necessary to carry out success",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型在白盒和黑盒环境中容易受到对抗样本的攻击。虽然先前的研究表明攻击成功率很高，但将DNN模型与解释模型相结合可以在人类专家介入时提供一种安全感，人类专家可以确定所给样本是良性的还是恶意的。然而，在白盒环境中，可解释的深度学习系统(IDLSes)易受恶意篡改的攻击。在黑盒设置中，由于对IDLSes组件的访问受限，对手更难以欺骗系统。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于查询效率和评分的黑箱攻击IDLSes的方法，称为QuScore，它不需要了解目标模型及其耦合的解释模型。QuScore基于转移和评分方法，采用一种有效的微生物遗传算法。我们的方法旨在减少必要的查询数量以进行成功的攻击。",
