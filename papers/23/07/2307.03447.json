Next, employing the Pasch-Hausdorff envelope, we build a suitable family of convex drivers of BSDEs inducing a corresponding family of dynamic convex risk measures of which the dynamic return and star-shaped risk measures emerge as the essential minimum. Furthermore, we prove that if the set of star-shaped supersolutions of a BSDE is not empty, then there exists, for each terminal condition, at least one convex BSDE with a non-empty set of supersolutions, yielding the minimal star-shaped supersolution. We illustrate our theoretical results in a few examples and demonstrate their usefulness in two applications, to capital allocation and portfolio choice.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过反向随机微分方程（BSDE）来建立动态收益和星形风险度量的表征结果。首先，我们在局部凸Frechet格上表征了一类静态星形泛函。接下来，利用Pasch-Hausdorff包络，我们构建了一类适当的凸BSDE驱动，引出了相应的动态凸风险度量，其中动态收益和星形风险度量作为基本的最小值。此外，我们证明了如果一个BSDE的星形超解集非空，则对于每个终端条件，至少存在一个凸BSDE具有非空的超解集，从而得到最小的星形超解。我们通过几个例子说明了我们的理论结果，并展示了它们在资本配置和投资组合选择中的实用性。",
