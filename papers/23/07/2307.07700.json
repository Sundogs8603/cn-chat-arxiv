By treating the neural network output as the probability distribution over atomic facts in answer set programs, NeurASP provides a simple and effective way to integrate sub-symbolic and symbolic computation. We demonstrate how NeurASP can make use of a pre-trained neural network in symbolic computation and how it can improve the neural network's perception result by applying symbolic reasoning in answer set programming. Also, NeurASP can be used to train a neural network better by training with ASP rules so that a neural network not only learns from implicit correlations from the data but also from the explicit complex semantic constraints expressed by the rules.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了NeurASP，它是对Answer Set Programs的简单扩展，通过融合神经网络。通过将神经网络输出视为Answer Set Programs中原子事实的概率分布，NeurASP提供了一种简单有效的将子符号和符号计算相结合的方法。我们展示了NeurASP如何在符号计算中利用预训练的神经网络，并通过应用Answer Set Programming中的符号推理来改进神经网络的感知结果。此外，NeurASP可以通过使用ASP规则进行训练来更好地训练神经网络，使其不仅从数据中学习隐式相关性，还从规则所表示的显式复杂语义约束中学习。",
