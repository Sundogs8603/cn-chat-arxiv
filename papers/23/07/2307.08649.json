    "abstract": "In the pursuit of accurate and scalable quantitative methods for financial market analysis, the focus has shifted from individual stock models to those capturing interrelations between companies and their stocks. However, current relational stock methods are limited by their reliance on predefined stock relationships and the exclusive consideration of immediate effects. To address these limitations, we present a groundbreaking framework for financial market analysis. This approach, to our knowledge, is the first to jointly model investor expectations and automatically mine latent stock relationships. Comprehensive experiments conducted on China's CSI 300, one of the world's largest markets, demonstrate that our model consistently achieves an annual return exceeding 10%. This performance surpasses existing benchmarks, setting a new state-of-the-art standard in stock return prediction and multiyear trading simulations (i.e., backtesting).",

    "translated_abstract": "在追求准确和可扩展的金融市场分析方法中，注意力已转向捕捉公司和其股票之间的相互关系的方法，而不是个别股票模型。然而，当前的关联股票方法受到其依赖预定义股票关系和仅考虑直接影响的限制。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一个开创性的金融市场分析框架。据我们所知，这种方法是首次联合建模投资者预期并自动挖掘潜在股票关系。对中国的CSI 300指数进行的全面实验表明，我们的模型始终实现超过10%的年度回报。这种性能优于现有基准，从而在股票回报预测和多年交易模拟（即回测）方面树立了新的技术标准。",
