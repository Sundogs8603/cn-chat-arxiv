    "translated_abstract": "图形识别问题是指在给定节点的状态/特征轨迹的情况下发现网络中节点之间的相互作用。这个问题很具挑战性，因为节点的行为受到未知交互模型的影响。此外，高维和非线性状态轨迹使得难以确定两个节点是否相连。现有的方法依赖于对图形拓扑和节点动态行为的先验知识，因此在其他网络配置上的泛化能力较差。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的基于学习的方法，它结合了（i）一个具有全局收敛保证的高度凸优化程序，有效地揭示图形拓扑结构，（ii）一种自我注意编码器，它学习将原始状态轨迹嵌入到特征空间中，并预测适当的正规化器用于优化程序。与其他方法不同，我们的方法可以识别未知图形拓扑的网络节点。",
