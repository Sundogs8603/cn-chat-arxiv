    "translated_abstract": "轨迹预测对于自动驾驶车辆至关重要。现有的大多数方法倾向于建模历史轨迹（输入）与未来轨迹（输出）之间的相关性。由于相关性只是对现实的一种表面描述，这些方法在很大程度上依赖于独立同分布的假设，并对超出分布的数据表现出高度的敏感性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个超出分布因果图（OOD-CG），它明确地定义了数据的潜在因果结构，包括三个纠缠的潜在特征：1）领域不变的因果特征（IC），2）领域变量的因果特征（VC），3）领域变量的非因果特征（VN）。这些特征受到混淆因子（C）和领域选择器（D）的影响。为了利用因果特征进行预测，我们提出了一个因果启发学习框架（CILF），它包括三个步骤：1）通过不变性损失提取领域不变的因果特征，2）通过因果性损失提取领域变量特征",
