    "translated_abstract": "大规模文本到图像扩散模型的生成先验使得在多样化的视觉模态上有了广泛的新生成和编辑应用。然而，当将这些先验适应于复杂的视觉模态，通常表示为多个图像（例如视频）时，实现一组图像的一致性是具有挑战性的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，协同分数蒸馏（CSD）。CSD基于斯坦变分梯度下降（SVGD）。具体而言，我们建议将多个样本视为SVGD更新中的“粒子”，并结合它们的分数函数以同时蒸馏一组图像上的生成先验。因此，CSD促进了2D图像之间信息的无缝集成，从而实现了多个样本的一致视觉合成。我们展示了CSD在多种任务中的有效性，包括全景图像、视频和3D场景的视觉编辑。我们的结果突出了CSD的能力。",
