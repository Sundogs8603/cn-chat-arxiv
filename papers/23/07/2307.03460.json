We show that this general framework encompasses NUTS as a particular case, implying the invariance of the target distribution as a by-product. Second, we establish conditions under which NUTS is irreducible and aperiodic and as a corrolary ergodic. Under conditions similar to the ones existing for HMC, we also show that NUTS is geometrically ergodic. Finally, we improve existing convergence results for HMC showing that this method is ergodic without any boundedness condition on the stepsize and the number of leapfrog steps, in the case where the target is a perturbation of a Gaussian distribution.",

    "translated_abstract": "针对动态实现的Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)算法，例如No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS)，在许多具有挑战性的推理问题中具有成功的经验证据，但关于它们行为的理论结果还不足。本文旨在填补这一空白。具体而言，我们考虑了一个称为动态HMC的通用MCMC算法类。我们证明了这个通用框架涵盖了NUTS作为一个特例，并且作为一个附带结果，证明了目标分布的不变性。其次，我们建立了使NUTS不可约和非周期的条件，并作为推论而证明了遍历性。在类似于HMC的条件下，我们还证明了NUTS具有几何遍历性。最后，我们改进了现有的HMC收敛性结果，证明了这个方法在目标分布是高斯分布的微扰的情况下，无需对步长和leapfrog步数进行任何有界条件，也是遍历的。",

It also improves the convergence results for HMC, showing its ergodicity without any boundedness condition on the stepsize and the number of leapfrog steps, in the case of a Gaussian distribution perturbation as the target."
