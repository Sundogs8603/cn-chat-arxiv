    "abstract": "In recent years, the use of emojis in social media has increased dramatically, making them an important element in understanding online communication. However, predicting the meaning of emojis in a given text is a challenging task due to their ambiguous nature. In this study, we propose a transformer-based approach for emoji prediction using BERT, a widely-used pre-trained language model. We fine-tuned BERT on a large corpus of text containing both text and emojis to predict the most appropriate emoji for a given text. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art models in predicting emojis with an accuracy of over 75 percent. This work has potential applications in natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and social media marketing.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，社交媒体中使用表情符号的频率大幅增加，使得它们成为了理解在线沟通的重要元素。然而，由于其含糊的特性，预测给定文本中表情符号的含义是一项具有挑战性的任务。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于Transformer的方法来使用BERT进行表情符号预测，BERT是一种广泛使用的预训练语言模型。我们在一个包含文本和表情符号的大型语料库上对BERT进行微调，以预测给定文本的最合适的表情符号。我们的实验结果表明，我们的方法在预测表情符号方面的准确率超过了75％，优于几种最先进的模型。该研究在自然语言处理、情感分析和社交媒体营销方面具有潜在的应用前景。",
