    "translated_abstract": "远程感知图像的建筑物分割的有效性一直受到模型传递效果的阻碍。许多现有的建筑物分割方法都是基于U-Net的编码器-解码器架构开发的，其中编码器是从在ImageNet上预训练的新开发的骨干网络微调而来。然而，现有解码器设计的大量计算负担阻碍了这些现代编码器网络成功转移到遥感任务上。即使是广泛采用的深度监督策略也无法缓解这些挑战，因为在混合区域，前景和背景像素是交错的，导致其损失无效。本文对于现有的解码器网络设计进行了全面评估，并提出了一种名为BFSeg的高效框架来增强学习的效率和有效性。具体来说，本文提出了一种密集连接的粗到细特征融合解码器网络",
