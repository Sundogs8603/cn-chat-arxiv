Vehicle price prediction can be a challenging task due to the high number of attributes that should be considered for accurate prediction.

In this project, python scripts were built to normalize, standardize, and clean data to avoid unnecessary noise for machine learning algorithms. The data set used in this project can be very valuable in conducting similar research using different prediction techniques. Many assumptions were made on the basis of the data set. The proposed system uses a Decision tree model and Gradient boosting predictive model, which are combined in other to get closed to accurate prediction, the proposed model was evaluated and it gives a promising performance. The future price prediction of used vehicles with the help of the same data set will comprise different models.",
