    "translated_abstract": "维基百科等对等生产平台常常存在内容缺口。先前研究表明，推荐系统可以帮助解决这个问题，通过引导编辑人员关注被低估的主题。然而，目前尚不清楚这种方法是否会导致不太相关的推荐，从而降低对推荐内容的整体参与度。为了回答这个问题，我们首先在SuggestBot上进行了离线分析（研究1），然后进行了为期三个月的对照实验（研究2）。我们的结果显示，向用户展示来自被低估主题的文章可以增加在这些文章上的工作量，而不会明显降低对推荐内容的接受程度。我们讨论了结果的意义，包括如何忽视文章发现过程可能会人为地限制推荐。我们以\"过滤气泡\"的常见问题来展示这一现象，并对任何平台都存在的类似问题进行了类比。",

This finding is significant for addressing content gaps on peer production platforms."
