    "abstract": "Accurate battery lifetime prediction is important for preventative maintenance, warranties, and improved cell design and manufacturing. However, manufacturing variability and usage-dependent degradation make life prediction challenging. Here, we investigate new features derived from capacity-voltage data in early life to predict the lifetime of cells cycled under widely varying charge rates, discharge rates, and depths of discharge. Features were extracted from regularly scheduled reference performance tests (i.e., low rate full cycles) during cycling. The early-life features capture a cell's state of health and the rate of change of component-level degradation modes, some of which correlate strongly with cell lifetime. Using a newly generated dataset from 225 nickel-manganese-cobalt/graphite Li-ion cells aged under a wide range of conditions, we demonstrate a lifetime prediction of in-distribution cells with 15.1% mean absolute percentage error using no more than the first 15% of data",

    "translated_abstract": "精确的电池寿命预测对于预防性维护、保修和改进的电池设计和制造非常重要。然而，制造可变性和使用依赖性降解使得寿命预测变得具有挑战性。本研究通过从早期寿命中提取的容量-电压数据的新特征来预测在充电速率、放电速率和放电深度差异较大的电池的寿命。这些特征是从定期安排的参考性能测试中提取的（即低速完全循环）。早期生命周期特征捕捉到了电池的健康状态和各组件级别老化模式的变化速率，其中一些与电池寿命呈强相关性。通过对由225个镍-锰-钴/石墨锂离子电池在广泛条件下老化产生的新数据集的使用，我们证明了在分布内的电池的寿命预测能够达到15.1%的平均绝对百分比误差，并且只使用了前15%的数据。",
