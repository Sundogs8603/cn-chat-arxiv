    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了基于选择的反馈中识别最佳项目的问题。在这个问题中，公司依次向一群顾客展示显示集，并收集他们的选择。目标是以最少的样本数量和高置信水平识别出最受欢迎的项目。我们提出了一种基于消除的算法，即嵌套消除(Nested Elimination，NE)，它受到信息理论下界所暗示的嵌套结构的启发。NE的结构简单，易于实施，具有对样本复杂度的强大理论保证。具体而言，NE利用了一种创新的消除准则，并避免了解决任何复杂的组合优化问题的需要。我们提供了NE的特定实例和非渐近性的样本复杂度的上界。我们还展示了NE实现了高阶最坏情况渐近最优性。最后，来自合成和真实数据的数值实验验证了我们的理论。",
