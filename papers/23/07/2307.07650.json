    "abstract": "Wireless indoor localization has attracted significant amount of attention in recent years. Using received signal strength (RSS) obtained from WiFi access points (APs) for establishing fingerprinting database is a widely utilized method in indoor localization.

Compared to conventional static fingerprinting, the dynamicallyreconstructed database can adapt to a highly-changing environment, which achieves sustainability of localization accuracy. To deal with the time-varying issue, we propose a skeleton-assisted learning-based clustering localization (SALC) system, including RSS-oriented map-assisted clustering (ROMAC), cluster-based online database establishment (CODE), and cluster-scaled location estimation (CsLE).

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，无线室内定位引起了相当大的关注。使用从WiFi访问点（AP）获取的接收信号强度（RSS）建立指纹数据库是室内定位中广泛使用的方法。然而，现有文献中对室内定位系统的时变问题研究不充分。与传统的静态指纹相比，动态重建的数据库可以适应高度变化的环境，从而实现定位准确性的可持续性。为了解决时变问题，我们提出了一种基于骨架辅助学习聚类定位（SALC）系统，包括基于RSS导向的地图辅助聚类（ROMAC）、基于聚类的在线数据库建立（CODE）和基于聚类的定位估计（CsLE）。SALC方案同时考虑了基于骨架最短路径（SSP）和参考点（RPs）之间的时变RSS测量的相似性。",
