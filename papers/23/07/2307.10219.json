    "translated_abstract": "超关系知识图(HKGs)是传统知识图(KGs)的延伸，为每个KG事实提供额外的键值对(即限定词)，以更好地限制事实的有效性。近年来，研究在HKGs上进行图推理越来越受关注。与此同时，由于世界知识的不断演变，大量平行工作集中在对时间KGs(TKGs)进行推理，其中每个TKG事实可以被视为带有时间戳(或时间段)的KG事实，指定其时间有效性。现有的HKG推理方法不考虑时间信息，因为在之前的基准数据集中没有显式地指定。此外，所有以前的TKG推理方法只重视时间推理，并没有办法从限定词中学习。因此，我们的目标是填补TKG推理和HKG推理之间的差距。我们开发了两个新的基准超关系TKG(HTKG)数据集，即Wiki-hy和...",
