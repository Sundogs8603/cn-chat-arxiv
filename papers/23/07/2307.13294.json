    "translated_abstract": "尽管人脸识别在我们的日常生活中开始扮演重要角色，但我们需要注意到，基于数据驱动的人脸识别视觉系统容易受到对抗性攻击。然而，当前两种对抗性攻击，即数字攻击和物理攻击，都有缺点，前者不实用，后者显眼、计算量大且不可执行。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种实用、可执行、不显眼且计算量较低的对抗性攻击方法，基于LED照明调制。为了欺骗系统，该攻击方法通过对场景LED照明进行快速强度调制，在人眼看不到的范围内生成难以察觉的亮度变化，并利用CMOS图像传感器的卷帘快门效应，向捕获的人脸图像中注入亮度信息扰动。总之，我们提出了一种用于人脸检测的拒绝服务（DoS）攻击以及一种用于人脸验证的躲避攻击。",
