    "translated_abstract": "近年来，随着对感知能力巨大需求的无线通信的不断发展，集成感知和通信（ISAC）技术应运而生，其中被动感知起着重要的作用。被动感知的主要挑战是在通信解调错误的条件下如何实现高感知性能。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为ISAC-NET的ISAC网络，它通过使用基于模型的深度学习（DL）将被动感知与通信信号检测相结合。与现有的首先解调传输的符号，然后从解调的符号中获得被动感知结果的被动感知算法不同，ISAC-NET同时获得被动感知结果和通信解调符号。不同于数据驱动的DL方法，我们采用了块处理信号的方法，将ISAC-NET划分为被动感知模块、信号检测模块和信道重构模块。",
