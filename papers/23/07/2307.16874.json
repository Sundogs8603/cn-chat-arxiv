    "abstract": "Over the last decade, the cryptocurrency market has experienced unprecedented growth, emerging as a prominent financial market. As this market rapidly evolves, it necessitates re-evaluating which cryptocurrencies command the market and steer the direction of blockchain technology. We implement a network-based cryptocurrency market analysis to investigate this changing landscape. We use novel hourly-resolution data and Kendall's Tau correlation to explore the interconnectedness of the cryptocurrency market. We observed critical differences in the hierarchy of cryptocurrencies determined by our method compared to rankings derived from daily data and Pearson's correlation. This divergence emphasizes the potential information loss stemming from daily data aggregation and highlights the limitations of Pearson's correlation. Our findings show that in the early stages of this growth, Bitcoin held a leading role. However, during the 2021 bull run, the landscape changed drastically. We see that",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，加密货币市场经历了空前的增长，成为了一个重要的金融市场。随着这个市场的快速发展，有必要重新评估哪些加密货币主导市场并引领区块链技术的方向。我们采用基于网络的加密货币市场分析方法来研究这个不断变化的格局。我们使用新颖的按小时分辨率数据和Kendall's Tau相关性来探索加密货币市场的相互关联性。我们观察到，与从每日数据和Pearson相关性派生的排名相比，我们的方法在加密货币的层次结构中存在重要的差异。这种差异强调了从每日数据聚合中潜在的信息损失，并凸显了Pearson相关性的局限性。我们的研究结果表明，在这一增长的初期，比特币扮演了领导角色。然而，在2021年的牛市中，格局发生了巨大变化。",
