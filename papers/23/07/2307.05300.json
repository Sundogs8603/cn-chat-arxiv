    "translated_abstract": "人类智慧依赖于认知协同的概念，即在不同认知过程之间进行协作和信息整合，以获得比个体认知过程更出色的结果。尽管大型语言模型（LLM）作为通用任务解决代理表现出了令人期待的性能，但它们在需要丰富领域知识和复杂推理的任务上仍然面临困难。在这项工作中，我们提出了单人表现提示（SPP）的概念，通过与多个角色进行多轮自我协作，将单个LLM转化为认知协同者。认知协同者指的是一个智能代理，与多个智慧合作，结合他们的个体优势和知识，从而增强复杂任务的问题解决能力和整体性能。通过根据任务输入动态识别和模拟不同的角色，SPP释放了LLM中认知协同的潜力。",
