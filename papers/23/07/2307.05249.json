    "translated_abstract": "多中心正电子发射断层扫描（PET）图像合成旨在从多个不同中心恢复低剂量PET图像。由于不同中心具有不同的成像系统/协议和数据分布，现有方法的普适性仍然不够理想，会导致域转移问题。虽然一些方法通过为每个中心训练专门的模型来解决域转移问题，但这些方法参数效率低，无法充分利用中心之间的共享知识。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了一个通用模型，该模型在中心之间共享架构和参数以利用共享知识。然而，通用模型可能会遇到中心干扰的问题，即由于非相同的数据分布，不同中心的梯度方向可能不一致甚至相反。为了减轻这种干扰，我们引入了一种新颖的动态路由策略和跨层连接。",
