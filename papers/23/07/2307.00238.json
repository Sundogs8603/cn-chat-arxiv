    "abstract": "Transfer learning plays a key role in modern data analysis when: (1) the target data are scarce but the source data are sufficient; (2) the distributions of the source and target data are heterogeneous. This paper develops an interpretable unified transfer learning model, termed as UTrans, which can detect both transferable variables and source data. More specifically, we establish the estimation error bounds and prove that our bounds are lower than those with target data only. Besides, we propose a source detection algorithm based on hypothesis testing to exclude the nontransferable data. We evaluate and compare UTrans to the existing algorithms in multiple experiments. It is shown that UTrans attains much lower estimation and prediction errors than the existing methods, while preserving interpretability. We finally apply it to the US intergenerational mobility data and compare our proposed algorithms to the classical machine learning algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "在现代数据分析中，当目标数据稀缺而源数据充足，或者源数据和目标数据的分布不同的情况下，转移学习在发挥重要作用。本文提出了一种可解释的统一转移学习模型，称为UTrans，该模型能够检测可转移变量和源数据。具体来说，我们建立了估计误差界限，并证明我们的界限低于仅有目标数据的界限。此外，我们基于假设检验提出了一种源数据检测算法，用于排除不可转移的数据。我们在多个实验中评估和比较了UTrans与现有算法。结果显示，UTrans在保持可解释性的同时，比现有方法具有更低的估计和预测误差。最后，我们将其应用于美国代际流动数据，并将我们提出的算法与经典的机器学习算法进行比较。",
