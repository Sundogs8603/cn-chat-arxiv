    "translated_abstract": "在现代推荐系统中，无偏学习排序（LTR）对于优先考虑来自有偏的隐式用户反馈（如点击数据）的项目是至关重要的。已经提出了一些技术，例如倒数倾向性加权（IPW），用于单边市场。然而，在双边市场（如工作平台或约会服务）中，成功转化需要匹配两个用户的偏好，但对于这种情况关注较少。本文解决了双边市场中用户之间的偏见相互作用，并提出了一种特定的LTR方法。我们首先提出了双边匹配平台中反馈机制的形式化，并指出它们的隐式反馈可能包含来自两个用户群体的位置偏差。基于这一观察，我们扩展了IPW估计器并提出了一种新的估计器，称为双边IPW，以解决双边市场中的位置偏见。我们证明了该估计器满足真实排名的无偏性。",
