Different types of representations may be suited to different types of tasks, making identifying and understanding learned representations a critical part of understanding and designing useful networks. In this paper, we introduce a new pseudo-kernel based tool for analyzing and predicting learned representations, based only on the initial conditions of the network and the training curriculum. We validate the method on a simple test case, before demonstrating its use on a question about the effects of representational learning on sequential single versus concurrent multitask performance. We show that our method can be used to predict the effects of the scale of weight initialization and training curriculum on representational learning and downstream concurrent multitasking performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "神经网络（包括生物和人工）的一个关键特性是它们如何学习来表示和处理输入信息以解决任务。不同类型的表示可能适合不同类型的任务，因此识别和理解学习到的表示是理解和设计有用网络的关键部分。本文介绍了一种基于伪核的工具，仅基于网络的初始状态和训练计划来分析和预测学习到的表示。我们在简单测试案例上验证了该方法，然后在关于表示学习对顺序单任务与并发多任务性能影响的问题上展示了其使用。我们展示了我们的方法可以用来预测权重初始化的规模和训练计划对表示学习和下游并发多任务性能的影响。",
