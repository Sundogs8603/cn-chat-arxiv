    "translated_abstract": "随着模型电路将规模缩小到亚微米级别的先进技术节点，有效获得SRAM组件故障概率的准确估计已成为一个核心问题。在本研究中，我们重新审视了经典的范数最小化方法，并推广了它以适用于无限组件，并提出了新颖的最优流形概念，将基于替代模型和重要性采样（IS）的产量估计方法联系起来。接着，我们推导出了一个次优流形，最优超球体，它引导了一种高效的采样方法，能够识别到故障边界，称为洋葱采样。最后，我们使用神经耦合流作为重要性采样的提议分布，该分布类似于替代模型从样本中学习。这些组合产生了一种名为\"优化流形重要性采样\"（OPTIMIS）的新型产量估计方法，它保持了替代模型和重要性采样方法的优点，具有强韧性和稳定性。",
