    "translated_abstract": "许多现实世界的过程具有复杂的尾依赖结构，这种结构无法使用传统的高斯过程来描述。更灵活的空间极端值模型， 如高斯尺度混合模型和单站点调节模型，具有吸引人的极端依赖性质，但往往难以拟合和模拟。本文中，我们提出了一种新的空间极端值模型，具有灵活和非平稳的相关性属性，并将其集成到变分自动编码器 (extVAE) 的编码-解码结构中。 extVAE 可以作为一个时空模拟器，对潜在的机制模型输出状态的分布进行建模，并产生具有与输入相同属性的输出，尤其是在尾部区域。通过广泛的模拟研究，我们证明我们的extVAE比传统的贝叶斯推断更高效，并且在具有 平稳相关性结构的许多空间极端值模型中表现 更好。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种新的空间极端值模型，通过集成在变分自动编码器的结构中，可以灵活、高效地模拟具有非平稳相关性的极端事件。实验证明，在时间效率和性能上，相对于传统的贝叶斯推断和许多具有平稳相关性的空间极端值模型，我们的方法具有优势。",
    "en_tdlr": "A new spatial extremes model is proposed in this paper, which is integrated into the structure of a variational autoencoder (extVAE) for flexible and efficient emulation of non-stationary extreme events. Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional Bayesian inference and many stationary spatial extremes models in terms of time efficiency and performance."
