    "translated_abstract": "已经提出了几种成员推断（MI）攻击方法来审计目标DNN。给定一组主题，MI攻击可以告诉我们目标DNN在训练过程中观察到了哪些主题。本文关注后期训练MI攻击，强调在低虚假阳性率（FPR）下的高置信度成员检测--真正阳性率（TPR）。目前在这个类别中的工作--似然比攻击（LiRA）和增强MI攻击（EMIA）--只在复杂的数据集（比如CIFAR-10和Imagenet）上表现良好，而在更简单的数据集上表现不佳（Fashion-MNIST上两种攻击都是0%的TPR，MNIST上分别是1% FPR的2%和0% TPR）。为了解决这个问题，首先我们通过提出一个分为三个阶段的框架（准备、指示和决策）来统一当前的MI攻击。其次，我们利用这个框架提出了两种新的攻击方法：（1）对抗成员推断攻击（AMIA）有效地利用成员分类中的特征进行攻击。(2) Emphasizing-on-Misclassified Samples Attack (EMSA) 通过强调错误分类的样本来提高攻击性能。",
