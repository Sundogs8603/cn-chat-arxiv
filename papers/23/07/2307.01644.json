    "abstract": "This paper delves into an advanced implementation of Chain-of-Thought-Prompting in Large Language Models, focusing on the use of tools (or \"plug-ins\") within the explicit reasoning paths generated by this prompting method. We find that tool-enabled conversational agents often become sidetracked, as additional context from tools like search engines or calculators diverts from original user intents. To address this, we explore a concept wherein the user becomes the tool, providing necessary details and refining their requests. Through Conversation Analysis, we characterize this interaction as insert-expansion - an intermediary conversation designed to facilitate the preferred response. We explore possibilities arising from this 'user-as-a-tool' approach in two empirical studies using direct comparison, and find benefits in the recommendation domain.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文深入研究了在大型语言模型中实现Chain-of-Thought-Prompting的高级方式，重点研究了在这种提示方法生成的明确推理路径中使用工具（或“插件”）。我们发现，使用工具的对话式智能助手往往会走偏，因为来自搜索引擎或计算器等工具的额外上下文会偏离原始用户意图。为了解决这个问题，我们探索了一种概念，即用户成为工具，提供必要的细节并完善他们的请求。通过对话分析，我们将这种交互称为插入扩展-一种旨在促进所需响应的中间对话。我们通过两个实证研究使用直接比较的方法探索了从这种“用户作为工具”的方法中产生的可能性，并在推荐领域中发现了好处。",

By treating the user as a tool and providing more details and refined requests, it addresses the issue of tool-induced sidetracking. Two empirical studies show the benefits of this approach in the recommendation domain."
