    "translated_abstract": "传统的自动化技术单独并不足以实现非受限基础设施上的无人驾驶列车运行（称为GoA 4）。现今，所需的感知任务通过机器学习（ML）实现，因此需要可靠高效地开发和部署。达到这个目标的一个重要方面是使用一个安全的MLOps流程，用于解决改进再现性、可追溯性、协作性和无人驾驶运营对不断变化的条件的持续适应性。MLOps结合了机器学习应用开发和操作（Ops），基于运营反馈实现高频软件发布和持续创新。本文概述了在铁路领域中持续开发和安全保证基于机器学习系统的安全MLOps流程。它将系统工程、安全保证和机器学习生命周期融入一个全面的工作流程中。我们介绍了流程的各个阶段和它们之间的相互关系。",
