    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个名为KorraAI的新框架，用于构建和设计具有体验对话能力的代理。我们的框架考虑了上下文信息，例如环境和互动时间，以及人类互动伙伴提供的不确定信息，模拟代理的行为。此外，KorraAI构建的代理可以表现出积极主动的行为，因为它们可以主动与人类伙伴进行互动。为了实现这些目的，KorraAI采用了概率编程。KorraAI中的概率模型用于建模代理的行为和与用户的互动。它们能够适应用户的偏好，并在代理中引入一定程度的不确定性，以实现更自然的行为。KorraAI可以使用分布和贝叶斯网络建模人类一样的内部状态，例如情绪、喜好和情感（如惊喜）。这些模型可以在没有与用户互动的情况下随时间演变。ECA模型作为插件实现，并共享一个共同的模块。",
