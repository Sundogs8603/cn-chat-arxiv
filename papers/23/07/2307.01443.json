Recently, the US government passed its most prominent piece of climate legislation to date, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), designed to invest in a wide range of programs that, among other provisions, incentivize clean energy and carbon management, encourage electrification and efficiency measures, reduce methane emissions, promote domestic supply chains, and address environmental justice concerns.

    "translated_abstract": "如果巴黎协定设定的目标得以实现，全球可能将全面控制升温在2摄氏度以下；然而，各方在兑现这些承诺方面进展不顺，越来越重视政策实施来缩小雄心和行动之间的差距。最近，美国政府通过了其迄今为止最重要的气候立法，即2022年的通胀减缓法案（IRA），旨在投资于一系列计划，其中包括激励清洁能源和碳管理、鼓励电气化和效率措施、减少甲烷排放、促进国内供应链，并解决环境公正问题等。IRA的范围和复杂性使建模对于理解其对排放和能源系统的影响非常重要。我们利用九个独立的先进模型的结果，研究了IRA关键条款的潜在影响，显示到2035年，全面经济减排量在2005年的基础上将减少43-48%。",
    "tldr": "通胀减缓法案（IRA）的研究显示，该法案的关键条款可能使到2035年经济的排放量在2005年基础上减少43-48%。",
    "en_tdlr": "Studies on the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) show that key provisions of the act could lead to a 43-48% reduction in emissions by 2035 compared to 2005 levels."
