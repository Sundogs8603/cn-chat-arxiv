    "translated_abstract": "生成式AI工具如chatGPT有望改变人们与在线信息的互动方式。近期，微软宣布了他们的“新Bing”搜索系统，其中整合了来自OpenAI的聊天和生成式AI技术。谷歌也宣布了将部署类似技术的搜索界面的计划。这些新技术将改变人们搜索信息的方式。本研究是对人们在搜索过程中如何使用生成式AI聊天系统（以下简称为chat）以及将chat系统与现有搜索工具结合可能如何影响用户的搜索行为和策略的早期调查研究。我们报道了一个探索性用户研究，有10名参与者使用了一个使用OpenAI GPT-3.5 API和Bing Web Search v5 API的综合Chat+Search系统。参与者完成了三个搜索任务。在这篇初步结果的预印论文中，我们报道了用户在搜索过程中遇到的问题和使用chat系统的方式。",
