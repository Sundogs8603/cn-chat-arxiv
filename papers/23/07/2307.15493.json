    "abstract": "Speech recognition systems are a key intermediary in voice-driven human-computer interaction. Although speech recognition works well for pristine monologic audio, real-life use cases in open-ended interactive settings still present many challenges. We argue that timing is mission-critical for dialogue systems, and evaluate 5 major commercial ASR systems for their conversational and multilingual support. We find that word error rates for natural conversational data in 6 languages remain abysmal, and that overlap remains a key challenge (study 1). This impacts especially the recognition of conversational words (study 2), and in turn has dire consequences for downstream intent recognition (study 3). Our findings help to evaluate the current state of conversational ASR, contribute towards multidimensional error analysis and evaluation, and identify phenomena that need most attention on the way to build robust interactive speech technologies.",

    "translated_abstract": "语音识别系统是语音驱动的人机交互的关键中间件。尽管语音识别在无污染的单向音频上表现良好，但在开放式互动环境中的真实应用场景仍然存在许多挑战。我们认为时序对对话系统至关重要，并评估了5个主要商业ASR系统在对话和多语言支持方面的表现。我们发现6种语言的自然对话数据的词错误率仍然很高，并且重叠仍然是一个重要挑战（研究1）。这尤其影响对话词的识别（研究2），进而对后续的意图识别产生严重后果（研究3）。我们的研究结果有助于评估当前对话ASR的状态，为多维度错误分析和评估做出贡献，并确定最需要关注的现象以构建强大的交互式语音技术。",
