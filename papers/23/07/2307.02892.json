    "abstract": "This work shows that depression changes the correlation between features extracted from speech. Furthermore, it shows that using such an insight can improve the training speed and performance of depression detectors based on SVMs and LSTMs. The experiments were performed over the Androids Corpus, a publicly available dataset involving 112 speakers, including 58 people diagnosed with depression by professional psychiatrists. The results show that the models used in the experiments improve in terms of training speed and performance when fed with feature correlation matrices rather than with feature vectors. The relative reduction of the error rate ranges between 23.1% and 26.6% depending on the model. The probable explanation is that feature correlation matrices appear to be more variable in the case of depressed speakers. Correspondingly, such a phenomenon can be thought of as a depression marker.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究表明，抑郁症会改变从语音中提取的特征之间的相关性。此外，它还表明利用这样的洞察力可以提高基于SVM和LSTMs的抑郁症检测器的训练速度和性能。实验是在Androids Corpus上进行的，这是一个涉及112名说话者的公开数据集，其中包括58名由专业精神病学家诊断为抑郁症的人。结果显示，实验中使用的模型在训练速度和性能方面都得到了改善，与使用特征向量相比，使用特征相关性矩阵作为输入时，错误率相对减少了23.1％到26.6％，具体取决于模型。可能的解释是，在抑郁的说话者中，特征相关性矩阵似乎更加多变。相应地，这种现象可以被视为抑郁症的一个标记。",
