    "translated_abstract": "布尔可满足性（SAT）是一个基本的NP完全问题，在许多应用中都有着重要的作用，包括自动化规划和调度。为了解决大规模的实例，SAT求解器必须依赖启发式方法，例如在DPLL和CDCL求解器中选择分支变量。这些启发式方法可以通过机器学习（ML）模型来改进，它们可以减少步骤的数量，但通常会影响运行时间，因为有用的模型相对较大且较慢。我们建议使用经过训练的ML模型进行少量初始步骤，然后将控制权交给传统启发式方法；这简化了SAT求解的冷启动过程，可以减少步骤的数量和整体运行时间，但需要另外决定何时将控制权交还给求解器。此外，我们还引入了一种针对从其他领域转换而来的SAT问题进行定制的Graph-Q-SAT修改版，例如开放车间调度问题。我们通过随机和工业SAT问题验证了我们方法的可行性。",
