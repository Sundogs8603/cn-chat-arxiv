    "translated_abstract": "由于基准流程的不一致性导致的发布结果的不可靠性，比较不同的年龄估计方法面临着挑战。先前的研究报告指出，使用专门的方法在过去十年中持续改善了性能，然而我们的发现对这些声明提出质疑。本文识别出当前使用的评估协议中存在的两个琐碎但持续存在的问题，并描述了如何解决它们。我们详细描述了我们的评估协议，并提供了使用该协议的具体示例。我们利用该协议对最先进的面部年龄估计方法进行了广泛的比较分析。令人惊讶的是，我们发现方法之间的性能差异与其他因素（如面部对齐、面部覆盖、图像分辨率、模型架构或用于预训练的数据量）相比微不足道。我们利用这些见解提出使用FaRL方法来解决这些问题。",
