    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶车辆和先进驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）有可能彻底改变我们出行的方式。许多这样的车辆目前依赖于分割和目标检测算法来检测和跟踪周围的物体。从车辆收集的数据通常被发送到云服务器以便于对这些算法进行持续/终身学习。考虑到带宽限制，数据在发送到服务器之前被压缩，通常会在训练和分析时进行解压缩。在这项工作中，我们提出使用基于学习的压缩编解码器来减少标准流水线中解压缩操作所产生的时延开销。我们证明了学习的压缩表示还可以用于执行语义分割等任务，以获取图像。我们在Cityscapes数据集上进行了实验证实所提出的流水线，在其中实现了一个压缩因子。",
