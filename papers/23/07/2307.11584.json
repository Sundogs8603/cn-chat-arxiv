    "abstract": "Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce a modality conversion concept aimed at enhancing emotion recognition performance on the MELD dataset. We assess our approach through two experiments: first, a method named Modality-Conversion that employs automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, followed by a text classifier; second, we assume perfect ASR output and investigate the impact of modality conversion on SER, this method is called Modality-Conversion++. Our findings indicate that the first method yields substantial results, while the second method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech-based approaches in terms of SER weighted-F1 (WF1) score on the MELD dataset. This research highlights the potential of modality conversion for tasks that can be conducted in alternative modalities.",

    "translated_abstract": "语音情感识别（SER）是一项具有挑战性的任务。本文介绍了一种模态转换的概念，旨在提高在MELD数据集上的情感识别性能。我们通过两个实验评估了我们的方法：第一个实验使用自动语音识别（ASR）系统和文本分类器实现的称为模态转换的方法；第二个实验假设有完美的ASR输出，并研究了模态转换对SER的影响，此方法称为模态转换++。我们的研究结果表明，第一个方法取得了显著的成果，而第二个方法在MELD数据集上的SER加权-F1（WF1）得分方面超越了最先进的基于语音的方法。这项研究突出了模态转换在可以使用替代模态进行的任务中的潜力。",
