    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种用于大型语言模型中上下文压缩的上下文自编码器（ICAE）。 ICAE有两个模块：一个可学习的编码器，通过从LLM中采用LoRA方式将长上下文压缩为有限数量的内存槽，以及一个固定的解码器，作为目标LLM，可以根据内存槽来进行各种目的的条件处理。我们首先使用自编码和语言建模目标在大规模文本数据上预训练ICAE，使其能够生成准确和全面表示原始上下文的内存槽。然后，我们使用少量指导数据对预训练的ICAE进行微调，以增强其与各种提示的交互，从而产生理想的响应。我们的实验结果表明，使用我们提出的预训练和微调范式学习的ICAE可以有效地产生$4\\times$上下文压缩的内存槽，目标LLM可以很好地对其进行条件处理，以响应各种提示。",
