    "abstract": "Generating unlabeled data has been recently shown to help address the few-shot hypothesis adaptation (FHA) problem, where we aim to train a classifier for the target domain with a few labeled target-domain data and a well-trained source-domain classifier (i.e., a source hypothesis), for the additional information of the highly-compatible unlabeled data. However, the generated data of the existing methods are extremely similar or even the same. The strong dependency among the generated data will lead the learning to fail. In this paper, we propose a diversity-enhancing generative network (DEG-Net) for the FHA problem, which can generate diverse unlabeled data with the help of a kernel independence measure: the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Specifically, DEG-Net will generate data via minimizing the HSIC value (i.e., maximizing the independence) among the semantic features of the generated data. By DEG-Net, the generated unlabeled data are more diverse and more effective",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，生成无标签数据有助于解决少样本假设适应（FHA）问题，其中我们旨在使用少量标记目标域数据和经过训练的源域分类器（即源假设）为目标域训练分类器，以获取高度兼容的无标签数据的附加信息。然而，现有方法生成的数据非常相似甚至相同。生成数据之间的强依赖性将导致学习失败。在本文中，我们提出了一种增强多样性的生成网络（DEG-Net）来解决FHA问题，该网络可以通过利用核独立性度量——希尔伯特-施密特独立性准则（HSIC）来生成多样化的无标签数据。具体而言，DEG-Net将通过最小化生成数据的语义特征之间的HSIC值（即最大化独立性）来生成数据。通过DEG-Net，生成的无标签数据更加多样化和有效。",
