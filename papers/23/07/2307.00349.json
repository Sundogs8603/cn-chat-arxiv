    "abstract": "We study the long-run behavior of land prices when land plays the dual role of a factor of production and a store of value. In modern economies where technological progress is faster in non-land sectors, when the elasticity of substitution exceeds 1 at high input levels (which always holds if non-land factors do not fully depreciate), unbalanced growth occurs and land becomes overvalued on the long-run trend relative to the fundamental value defined by the present value of land rents. Around the trend, recurrent stochastic fluctuations in land prices occur, with expansions and contractions in the size of land overvaluation.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了当土地既充当生产要素又作为价值存储时，土地价格的长期行为。在现代经济中，非土地部门的技术进步更快，当替代弹性在高输入水平上超过1时（如果非土地要素不完全折旧的话，这总是成立的），就会出现不平衡增长，使得土地在长期趋势上相对于地租现值定义的基本价值过度估值。在趋势线附近，土地价格出现周期性的随机波动，包括土地过度估值的扩张和收缩。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates the long-term behavior of land prices when land serves as both a factor of production and a store of value. When non-land sectors experience faster technological progress and the elasticity of substitution exceeds 1, unbalanced growth occurs, resulting in land being overvalued relative to its fundamental value in the long run."
