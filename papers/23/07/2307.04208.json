    "abstract": "Generative AI technologies are gaining unprecedented popularity, causing a mix of excitement and apprehension through their remarkable capabilities. In this paper, we study the challenges associated with deploying synthetic data, a subfield of Generative AI. Our focus centers on enterprise deployment, with an emphasis on privacy concerns caused by the vast amount of personal and highly sensitive data. We identify 40+ challenges and systematize them into five main groups -- i) generation, ii) infrastructure & architecture, iii) governance, iv) compliance & regulation, and v) adoption. Additionally, we discuss a strategic and systematic approach that enterprises can employ to effectively address the challenges and achieve their goals by establishing trust in the implemented solutions.",
