    "translated_abstract": "深度学习系统被提出来提高Ki-67 PI评分的客观性和效率。挑战在于，虽然深度学习技术非常准确，但在应用于领域外数据时性能下降。这对于临床应用来说是一个关键的挑战，因为模型通常是使用供应商可用的数据进行训练的，而这些数据不来自目标领域。为了解决这个问题，本研究提出了一个领域自适应流程，利用无监督框架在目标领域生成银标准（伪）标签，这些标签用于增加黄金标准（GS）源领域数据。研究在两个经过验证的Ki-67评分架构（UV-Net和piNET）上测试了五个训练策略：(1) 仅SS: 在目标银标准（SS）标签上训练，(2) 仅GS: 在源GS标签上训练，(3) 混合: 在目标SS和源GS标签上训练，(4) GS+SS: 在源GS标签上训练并在目标SS标签上进行微调，以及我们提出的元学习方法。",
