    "translated_abstract": "最近对于在线目标识别的研究主要关注在低可观测性下有效推断目标，而对于在离散和连续域中都能工作的在线目标识别的研究较少。在线目标识别方法通常需要在每个新的观测中多次调用规划器，造成了很高的计算成本。在连续空间中快速而可靠地识别目标对于任何轨迹规划问题都是至关重要的，因为真实物理世界是快速变动的，例如机器人应用。我们开发了一种高效的目标识别方法，在离散域中每个可能的目标只需要一次调用规划器，而在连续域中利用简化的运动模型来减小计算负担。由此产生的方法比当前最先进的方法在在线识别方面快几个数量级，使之成为首个实际可用于需要亚秒级响应的机器人应用的在线方法。",
