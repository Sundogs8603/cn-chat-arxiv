    "translated_abstract": "长程依赖的利用在同质图中有广泛研究，但在大规模异构信息网络中很少研究，这主要是由于高成本和有效信息利用的困难。为此，我们研究了不同元路径的重要性，并提出了一种在异构信息网络中利用长程依赖的自动框架，称为长程元路径搜索和渐进抽样（LMSPS）。具体来说，为了在没有先验知识的情况下发现各种数据集或任务的元路径，我们开发了一个包含所有目标节点相关元路径的搜索空间。通过渐进抽样算法，我们动态地缩小搜索空间，以跳数无关的时间复杂度驱动，从而得到一个由当前异构信息网络和任务驱动的紧凑搜索空间。利用抽样评估策略作为指导，我们进行了专门和具有表达力的元路径选择。对八个异构数据集进行的大量实验证明了LMSPS的有效性。",
