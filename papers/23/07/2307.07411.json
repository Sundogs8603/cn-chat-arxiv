We used this data to evaluate eight publicly-available LLM-generated text detectors through the measures of accuracy, false positives, and resilience. The purpose of this work is to inform the community of what LLM-generated text detectors work and which do not, but also to provide insights for educators to better maintain academic integrity in their courses.

    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLM）的最近改进和广泛应用，它们对教育中的学术诚信构成了严重威胁。现代的LLM生成文本检测器试图通过为教育工作者提供评估文本是否为LLM生成的服务来解决这个问题。在这项工作中，我们收集了ChatGPT创建之前计算机科学学生提交的124份作业，然后生成了40份ChatGPT作业。我们使用这些数据通过准确度、误报率和韧性这三个指标评估了八个公开可用的LLM生成文本检测器。这项工作的目的是向社区提供LLM生成文本检测器的工作情况，并为教育工作者提供洞察，以更好地维护课程的学术诚信。我们的结果发现CopyLeaks是最准确的LLM生成文本检测器，GPTKit是减少误报率的最佳LLM生成文本检测器，GLTR是最具韧性的LLM生成文本检测器。",
