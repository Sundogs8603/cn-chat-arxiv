    "translated_abstract": "计算机视觉和自然语言处理中基础模型的最近激增开创了利用多模态临床数据训练具有强大泛化能力的大型模型的前景。然而，病理图像数据集通常缺乏生物医学文本注释和丰富。利用生物医学文本知识指导高效的图像诊断成为一个重要的研究兴趣。在本文中，我们提出了连接图像和文本嵌入（CITE）来增强病理图像分类。CITE注入了从预先训练了广泛的生物医学文本的语言模型中获得的文本见解，从而使基础模型适应病理图像理解。通过对PatchGastric胃肿瘤病理图像数据集进行的大量实验，我们证明CITE在特别是数据稀缺时与各种基准方法相比取得了领先的性能。CITE提供了利用领域内文本知识加强数据-",
