An unexplored solution in this regime is the application of probabilistic machine learning methods to gyrochronology, a stellar dating technique that is uniquely well suited for these stars. While accurate analytical gyrochronological models have proven challenging to develop, here we apply conditional normalizing flows to photometric data from open star clusters, and demonstrate that a data-driven approach can constrain gyrochronological ages with a precision comparable to other standard techniques. We evaluate the flow results in the context of a Bayesian framework, and show that our inferred ages recover literature values well. This work demonstrates the potential of a probabilistic data-driven solution to widen the applicability of gyrochronological stellar dating.",

    "translated_abstract": "恒星年龄是进化模型的关键组成部分，但对于低质量主序星而言，测量起来具有挑战性。在这个范围内，尚未探索的解决方案是将概率机器学习方法应用于陀螺年龄学，这是一种非常适合这些恒星的恒星约会技术。虽然精确的分析陀螺年龄模型的开发仍然具有挑战性，但我们在这里将条件归一化流应用于开放星团的光度数据，并证明数据驱动方法可以与其他标准技术相比约束陀螺年龄。我们在贝叶斯框架下评估流动结果，并展示我们推断的年龄与文献值较为吻合。这项工作展示了概率数据驱动解决方案扩大陀螺年龄恒星约会的潜力。",
