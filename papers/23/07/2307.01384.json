    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习模型中，常观察到的一个模式是目标特征的欠预测，对于给定类别的成员，模型预测的目标率通常低于训练集中该类别成员的实际目标率。这种欠预测在少数群体的成员中通常更明显；例如，在“adult”数据集中，无论是男性还是女性的收入水平都被欠预测，但对于女性（该数据集中的少数群体），欠预测程度明显更高。我们提出，这种针对少数群体的欠预测模式是对小样本统计推断的可预测结果。当对一个新个体进行分类时，机器学习模型进行的推断不是基于整个训练集，而是基于一个与新个体在某种程度上相似的子集，这些子集的大小通常遵循幂律分布，大多数都很小（并且这些子集必须是必然小的）。",
