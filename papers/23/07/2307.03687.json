    "translated_abstract": "文本是医疗数据中普遍存在的组成部分，包含了有关患者特征和治疗的宝贵信息，这些信息通常在结构化图表数据中缺失。尽管如此丰富，但由于其复杂性，它很少在临床研究中使用。利用大量患者记录和治疗历史的数据库，以及陪护医生和护士的广泛笔记，我们展示了如何在电子健康数据中利用文本数据支持因果推断的各个阶段，从构思和设计到分析和解释，仅需很少的额外工作。我们重点关注使用配对匹配进行因果推断的研究。我们通过三种方式将文本纳入经典配对分析中：通过使用文本补充多重插补程序，改善了对处理缺失数据的插补值的准确性；通过在匹配阶段中纳入文本，增强了匹配过程的合理性；通过对文本进行条件处理，我们可以估计...",
