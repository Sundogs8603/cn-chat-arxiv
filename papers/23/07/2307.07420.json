    "translated_abstract": "对于公共和私人公司，可比公司分析被广泛用作公司估值的方法。特别是对于私募股权公司的估值，该方法非常有价值。可比公司方法的几种方法通常依赖于定性方法来识别相似的同行公司，这往往使用已建立的行业分类方案和/或分析师的直觉和知识。然而，文献和私募股权行业开始使用更多的量化方法，特别是机器学习聚类和自然语言处理（NLP）。对于NLP方法，该过程包括从公司的网站或来自某些金融数据库系统的公司描述中提取产品实体，然后进行相似性分析。在这里，我们使用公开可用的公司维基百科网站的公司描述/摘要，展示了使用大型语言模型（LLM），例如GPT",

Traditional methods for comparable companies usually rely on qualitative approaches to identify similar peer companies, while we propose a more quantitative method using large language models to perform similarity analysis through extracting company descriptions/summaries."
