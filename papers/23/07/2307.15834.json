    "translated_abstract": "对称性在科学、机器学习和统计学中起着重要的作用。对于已知遵循对称性的数据，已经开发出了许多利用对称性的方法。然而，对于普遍群对称性的存在或不存在的统计检验几乎不存在。本研究提出了一种非参数假设检验方法，基于单个独立同分布样本，用于针对特定群的分布对称性。我们提供了适用于两种广泛情况的对称性检验的一般公式。第一种情况是测试在紧致群作用下的边际或联合分布的不变性。在这里，一个渐近无偏的检验只需要一个可计算的概率分布空间上的度量和能够均匀随机采样群元素的能力。在此基础上，我们提出了一种易于实施的条件蒙特卡罗检验，并证明它可以实现精确的p值。",
