    "abstract": "Plastic has imbibed itself as an indispensable part of our day to day activities, becoming a source of problems due to its non-biodegradable nature and cheaper production prices. With these problems, comes the challenge of mitigating and responding to the aftereffects of disposal or the lack of proper disposal which leads to waste concentrating in locations and disturbing ecosystems for both plants and animals. As plastic debris levels continue to rise with the accumulation of waste in garbage patches in landfills and more hazardously in natural water bodies, swift action is necessary to plug or cease this flow. While manual sorting operations and detection can offer a solution, they can be augmented using highly advanced computer imagery linked with robotic appendages for removing wastes. The primary application of focus in this report are the much-discussed Computer Vision and Open Vision which have gained novelty for their light dependence on internet and ability to relay informatio",

    "translated_abstract": "塑料已经成为我们日常活动中不可或缺的一部分，由于其不可分解的性质和更便宜的生产价格，它成为了问题的根源。随之而来的问题是如何应对或减轻其处置或缺乏适当处理后的后果，这会导致废物在某些地方积聚，并扰乱植物和动物的生态系统。随着塑料废弃物水平的不断上升，并且废物在垃圾填埋场和更危险的天然水体中积累，需要迅速采取行动来阻止或停止这种流动。虽然手动分拣操作和检测可以提供解决方案，但可以借助与机器人附件关联的高度先进的计算机图像来增强它们。本报告的主要关注应用是备受关注的计算机视觉和开放视觉，它们因其对互联网的轻度依赖性和传输信息的能力而获得了新颖性。",
