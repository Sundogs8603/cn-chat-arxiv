    "translated_abstract": "当前自动化纤维成型(AFP)的缺陷检测系统主要基于端到端的监督学习方法，需要大量标记的有缺陷样本，而这些样本很难生成足够数量。为了解决这个数据稀缺的问题，我们引入了一种基于自动编码器的方法，适用于小型数据集。幸运的是，从基础的角度来看，这个问题可以简化为正常样本和异常样本之间的二分类。所提出的方法使用纤维层片（tow）对纤维铺设表面的深度图进行分割成小窗口。其中不包含异常的窗口子集传递给自动编码器来重构输入。因为自动编码器是用正常样本进行训练的，对于这些样本，它产生的重构比对于异常样本更精确。因此，重构误差的值被用作一个量化指标，用于判断是否存在潜在的异常。",
