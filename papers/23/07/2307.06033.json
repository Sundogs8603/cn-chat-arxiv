    "abstract": "While the term `art' defies any concrete definition, this paper aims to examine how digital images produced by generative AI systems, such as Midjourney, have come to be so regularly referred to as such. The discourse around the classification of AI-generated imagery as art is currently somewhat homogeneous, lacking the more nuanced aspects that would apply to more traditional modes of artistic media production. This paper aims to bring important philosophical considerations to the surface of the discussion around AI-generated imagery in the context of art. We employ existing philosophical frameworks and theories of language to suggest that some AI-generated imagery, by virtue of its visual properties within these frameworks, can be presented as `readymades' for consideration as art.",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然术语 \"艺术\" 没有具体的定义，但本文旨在研究由生成AI系统（如Midjourney）产生的数字图像为什么经常被称为艺术。目前，关于将AI生成的图像分类为艺术的讨论在某种程度上是同质的，缺乏适用于更传统艺术媒体制作方式的细致方面。本文旨在在艺术背景下将重要的哲学考虑带到关于AI生成图像的讨论的表面。我们使用现有的哲学框架和语言理论，提出一些AI生成的图像，凭借其在这些框架内的视觉特性，可以被作为 \"现成品\" 考虑为艺术。",
    "tldr": "这项研究探讨了AI生成的图像如何被视为艺术，并提出了一种哲学框架，认为一些AI生成的图像可以被视为 \"现成品\" 艺术。"
