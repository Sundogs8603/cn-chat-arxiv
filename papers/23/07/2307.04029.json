It is argued that ties among rational choices can be resolved by refinements of the concept of rationality based on the utilities of other players. One such refinement is the concept of Tit-for-Tat.",

    "translated_abstract": "游戏中玩家对于两个不同的结果冷漠无动于衷，小的微扰无法解决这个问题，因为实际的选择可能对其他玩家产生重大影响，导致他们以对冷漠的玩家产生重大影响的方式行动。本文认为，可以通过基于其他玩家效用的理性概念的细化来解决理性选择之间的平局问题。其中一种细化方法是\"以牙还牙\"的概念。",
