We present the design and implementation of a multi-user distributed system on Hopsworks, a data-intensive AI platform, following the multi-tenant model that provides RStudio as Software as a Service (SaaS). We use the most popular cloud-native technologies: Docker and Kubernetes, to solve the problems of performance isolation, security, and scaling that are present in a multi-tenant environment. We further enable secure data sharing in RStudio server instances to provide data privacy and allow collaboration among RStudio users. We integrate our system with Apache Spark",

    "translated_abstract": "为了充分利用云计算，服务采用“多租户”架构模型设计，旨在最大程度地实现用户之间的资源共享。然而，多租户引入了安全、性能隔离、扩展性和定制化方面的挑战。RStudio服务器是一个开源的集成开发环境（IDE），通过Web浏览器访问，用于R编程语言。我们在数据密集型AI平台Hopsworks上设计和实施了一个多用户分布式系统，采用多租户模型，以提供RStudio作为软件即服务（SaaS）。我们使用最流行的云原生技术：Docker和Kubernetes，解决了多租户环境中存在的性能隔离、安全性和扩展性问题。我们进一步在RStudio服务器实例中实现了安全数据共享，以提供数据隐私并允许RStudio用户之间的协作。我们将我们的系统与Apache Spark集成起来。",
