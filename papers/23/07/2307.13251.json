    "translated_abstract": "3D点云的实例分割（3DIS）是计算机视觉中一个长期存在的挑战，目前的先进方法主要基于全监督。由于标注真实密集实例掩码是繁琐且昂贵的，因此使用弱监督解决3DIS变得更加实用。在本文中，我们提出了GaPro，一种新的基于3D点云的实例分割方法，使用轴对齐的3D包围盒监督。我们的两步方法包括从盒子注释中生成伪标签，并使用结果标签训练3DIS网络。此外，我们采用自训练策略进一步提高我们方法的性能。我们设计了一个有效的高斯过程，可以从边界框生成伪实例掩码，并在它们重叠时解决不确定性问题，使得伪实例掩码具有其不确定性值。我们的实验证明，GaPro优于先前的弱监督3D实例分割方法，并具有竞争性能。",
