    "abstract": "The study of semantic relationships has revealed a close connection between these relationships and the morphological characteristics of a language. Morphology, as a subfield of linguistics, investigates the internal structure and formation of words. By delving into the relationship between semantic relationships and language morphology, we can gain deeper insights into how the underlying structure of words contributes to the interpretation and comprehension of language. This paper explores the dynamic interplay between semantic relationships and the morphological aspects of different languages, by examining the intricate relationship between language morphology and semantic relationships, valuable insights can be gained regarding how the structure of words influences language comprehension.",
