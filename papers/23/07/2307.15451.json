    "translated_abstract": "动态认知逻辑（DEL）为认知规划提供了一个框架，能够表示非确定性动作、部分可观察性、高阶知识以及事实和认知变化。DEL的高表达性挑战了现有的认知规划器，通常只能处理整个框架中的受限片段。本文的目标是推动实用DEL规划的发展，最终使认知规划器能够处理DEL提供的所有特性。为了实现这个目标，我们对DEL的传统语义进行了质疑，该语义是用Kripke模型来定义的。具体而言，我们提出了一种等价的语义，使用所谓的可能性作为主要构建模块，表示世界的事实属性和代理人认为可能的属性。我们称这个结果为DELPHIC框架。我们认为DELPHIC确实提供了对认知状态更紧凑的表示。",
