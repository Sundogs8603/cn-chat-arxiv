    "abstract": "Modeling customer shopping intentions is a crucial task for e-commerce, as it directly impacts user experience and engagement. Thus, accurately understanding customer preferences is essential for providing personalized recommendations. Session-based recommendation, which utilizes customer session data to predict their next interaction, has become increasingly popular. However, existing session datasets have limitations in terms of item attributes, user diversity, and dataset scale. As a result, they cannot comprehensively capture the spectrum of user behaviors and preferences. To bridge this gap, we present the Amazon Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset, namely Amazon-M2. It is the first multilingual dataset consisting of millions of user sessions from six different locales, where the major languages of products are English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, and Spanish.

    "translated_abstract": "对于电子商务来说，建模客户购物意图是一个重要的任务，因为它直接影响用户体验和参与度。因此，准确理解客户的偏好对于提供个性化推荐至关重要。基于会话的推荐技术利用客户会话数据来预测他们的下一次互动，已经越来越受到欢迎。然而，现有的会话数据集在项目属性、用户多样性和数据集规模方面存在局限性。因此，它们不能全面地捕捉用户行为和偏好的谱系。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了Amazon Multilingual Multi-locale Shopping Session Dataset，即Amazon-M2。它是第一个由来自六个不同区域的数百万用户会话组成的多语言数据集，其中产品的主要语言是英语、德语、日语、法语、意大利语和西班牙语。值得注意的是，这个数据集可以帮助我们增强个性化和理解用户偏好能力。",
