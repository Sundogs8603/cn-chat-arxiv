    "translated_abstract": "在医疗保健中，自我照顾能力体现在“日常生活活动（ADL）”中，ADL作为功能能力（运作能力）的衡量。功能能力不足可能导致需要个人护理和协助的恶劣生活条件。为了准确识别需要支持的人，协助计划会持续评估参与者在各个领域的功能能力。然而，当涉及多个具有不同水平的专家评估员时，评估过程可能遇到一致性问题。尤其是初学者评估员可能缺乏与参与者进行实际互动所需的必要准备。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了一个对话系统，以自然且可重现的方式模拟评估员和具有不同功能能力的个体之间的交互。对话系统由两个主要模块组成，一个用于自然语言理解（NLU），一个用于自然语言生成（NLG）。",
