    "translated_abstract": "因果推断在解释统计模型和人工智能模型所做决策方面起着重要作用。最近，这个领域开始引起研究人员和实践者的关注。本文对1992年至2023年公开发表的37篇论文进行了全面的综述，涉及了因果推断在银行、金融和保险领域的应用。根据领域的不同，论文被分为以下几类：(i) 银行，(ii) 金融及其子领域，如企业金融、金融治理（包括金融风险和金融政策）、金融经济学和行为金融，以及 (iii) 保险。此外，本文还介绍了因果推断的主要要素，包括贝叶斯因果网络、格兰杰因果关系以及相关的专业术语，如反事实。综述还提出了一些未来研究的重要方向。总之，我们观察到因果推断在银行金融和保险领域得到了广泛的应用，并希望对未来的研究起到了一定的推动作用。",
