In this work, we adapt a system of DRs for written language to spontaneous dialogue using crowdsourced annotations from novice annotators. We then test whether discourse relations are used differently across several types of multi-utterance contexts. We compare the patterns of DR annotation within and across speakers and within and across turns. Ultimately, we find that different discourse contexts produce distinct distributions of discourse relations, with single-turn annotations creating the most uncertainty for annotators. Additionally, we find that the discourse relation annotations are of sufficient quality to predict from embeddings of discourse units.",

    "translated_abstract": "时间压力和话题协商可能会对人们在自发对话中利用语篇关系(DRs)施加限制。在这项工作中，我们利用新手注释者的众包注释，将书面语言的DR系统适用于自发对话。然后，我们测试了在多语言环境中不同类型的多句话上，语篇关系的使用是否不同。我们比较了在发言人内部和跨发言人之间、在发言轮内部和跨发言轮之间的DR注释模式。最终，我们发现不同的语篇环境产生了不同的语篇关系分布，其中单一发言轮注释对注释者产生了最大的不确定性。此外，我们发现语篇关系的注释质量足以从语篇单元的嵌入中进行预测。",

The quality of annotated discourse relations is also sufficient for prediction using discourse unit embeddings."
