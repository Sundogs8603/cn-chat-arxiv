    "abstract": "Autonomous driving technology has five levels, from L0 to L5. Currently, only the L2 level (partial automation) can be achieved, and there is a long way to go before reaching the final level of L5 (full automation). The key to crossing these levels lies in training the autonomous driving model. However, relying solely on real-world road data to train the model is far from enough and consumes a great deal of resources. Although there are already examples of training autonomous driving models through simulators that simulate real-world scenarios, these scenarios require complete manual construction. Directly converting 3D scenes from road network formats will lack a large amount of detail and cannot be used as training sets. Underground parking garage static scenario simulation is regarded as a procedural content generation (PCG) problem. This paper will use the Sarsa algorithm to solve procedural content generation on underground garage structures.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶技术有五个等级，从L0到L5。目前，只能实现L2级别（部分自动化），距离达到最终的L5级别（完全自动化）还有很长的路要走。跨越这些级别的关键在于训练自动驾驶模型。然而，仅依赖真实世界的道路数据来训练模型远远不够，而且消耗大量资源。虽然已经有通过模拟器训练自动驾驶模型的例子，模拟的是真实世界场景，但这些场景需要完全手动构建。直接从道路网络格式转换3D场景会缺乏大量细节，无法用作训练集。地下停车场静态场景模拟被视为一种程序内容生成（PCG）问题。本文将使用Sarsa算法解决地下停车场结构的程序内容生成。",
