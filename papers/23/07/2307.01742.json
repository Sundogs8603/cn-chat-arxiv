    "translated_abstract": "学术研究的可重复性一直是一个持续存在的问题，与科学的基本原则相矛盾。更令人担忧的是最近在学术文稿中发现的虚假声明数量的增加，对所报告的结果的有效性产生了怀疑。在这篇论文中，我们利用一种适应性版本的本福特定律，这是一种描述自然发生的数据集中首位数字分布的统计现象，仅仅使用文稿中呈现的聚合数据来识别研究文稿中结果的潜在操纵。我们的方法将本福特定律的原理应用于学术文稿中常用的分析方法，从而减少对原始数据本身的需求。为了验证我们的方法，我们使用了100个开源数据集，并成功地使用我们的规则准确预测了其中的79%。此外，我们还分析了最近两年内在十个知名经济杂志上发表的100篇文稿。",
