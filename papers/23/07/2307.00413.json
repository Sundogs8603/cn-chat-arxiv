    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍并形式化了供求经典观点，我们认为这种观点与新古典理论具有独立性和独特性。在边际革命之前，需求和供给的定义不是通过一个不可观测的准则（如效用函数），而是通过一个可观测的货币变量“保留价格”来确定：买方的（最大）愿意支付（WTP）值（潜在价格）以及卖方的（最低）愿意接受（WTA）值（潜在价格）。市场的需求和供给分别是买方和卖方保留价格的累积分布。这种供求经典观点形成了实验经济学中市场参与者的激励方式，尽管实验经济学家（受过新古典经济学培训）并不知道它们与过去的联系。在这个基础上，建立了大量有关各种机构的交易规则的文献，包括现代机构。",
