    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，机器学习（ML）程序容易出错，并呼吁为ML代码建立合同。合同，如设计合同方法论中所述，有助于记录API并帮助API用户编写正确的代码。问题是：哪种类型的合同能最大程度地帮助API用户？我们特别关注哪种类型的合同有助于API用户在ML流程的早期阶段捕捉错误。我们描述了一项针对Stack Overflow上最经常讨论的四个ML库（TensorFlow，Scikit-learn，Keras和PyTorch）的帖子的实证研究。对于这些库，我们的研究提取了413个非正式（英文）API规范。我们使用这些规范来回答以下问题。ML合同违规的根本原因和影响是什么？是否存在常见的ML合同违规模式？理解ML合同何时需要先进的ML软件专业知识？检查API级别的合同能否有助于检测合同违规？",
