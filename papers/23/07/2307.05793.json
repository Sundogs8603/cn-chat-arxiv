    "translated_abstract": "动物和机器人通过构建和完善空间地图来导航环境。这些地图使得包括回家、规划、搜索和觅食在内的功能成为可能。在大型环境中，探索空间是一个难题：代理可能会陷入局部区域。在这里，我们从神经科学中汲取经验，提出并应用了分割和回溯（FarMap）的概念。代理通过基于意外性的空间聚类来解决地图构建问题，同时将其用于设置空间探索的子目标。代理构建和使用本地地图来预测他们的观测结果；高意外性会导致“分割事件”，从而截断本地地图。在这些事件中，最近的本地地图被放入长期记忆（LTM）中，并初始化另一个本地地图。如果断裂点的观察结果与存储的某个本地地图的观察结果相匹配，那么该地图就会被回溯（并重用）自LTM。分割点诱导.",
