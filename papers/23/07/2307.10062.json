    "translated_abstract": "部署深度视觉模型可能导致性能下降，原因是源域和目标域之间存在差异。一些方法利用带标签的源数据来估计目标域的准确性，但由于数据保密性或服务设备上的资源限制，访问带标签的源数据通常非常困难。我们的工作提出了一种新的框架，可以在没有访问源数据的情况下对未标记的目标数据进行模型准确性估计。我们研究了使用伪标签进行准确性估计的可行性，并在此基础上采用了最近的无源域自适应算法的进展。我们的方法衡量了从源假设演化而来的目标伪标记函数与源假设之间的不一致率。为了减轻由于理想联合假设风险较高而可能产生的错误伪标签的影响，我们采用自适应对抗性扰动来处理目标模型的输入。",
