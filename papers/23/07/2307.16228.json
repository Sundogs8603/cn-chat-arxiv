    "translated_abstract": "由于其经济和社会效益，电动自动驾驶车辆（EAV）正在未来的自主移动出行（AMoD）系统中引起关注。然而，EAV的独特充电模式（长时间充电、高充电频率、无法预测的充电行为等）使得准确预测EAV供应在E-AMoD系统中变得具有挑战性。此外，移动需求的预测不确定性使得在供应和需求不确定性下设计一个集成的车辆平衡解决方案成为紧迫且具有挑战性的任务。尽管基于强化学习的E-AMoD平衡算法取得了成功，但在EV供应或移动需求下的状态不确定性仍未被探索。在这项工作中，我们设计了一个基于多智能体强化学习（MARL）的框架，用于E-AMoD系统中的EAV平衡，其中包含对抗性智能体，用于模拟可能破坏车辆平衡解决方案的EAV供应和移动需求的不确定性。然后，我们提出了一个鲁棒的E-AMoD解决方案。",
