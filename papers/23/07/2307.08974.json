    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文介绍了ChatGPT的开发以及与其类似的生成人工智能（GAI）、生成预训练变换器（GPT）和大型语言模型（LLM）的广泛使用，同时也引发了对它们在学术研究和科学成果中道德应用、使用和披露的问题。鉴于目前缺乏统一的方法，一些出版商和期刊最近制定了自己的规则，但不一致的方法可能导致“巴别塔效应”，可能产生混淆而不是期望的标准化。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了ChatGPT、生成人工智能和自然大型语言模型用于负责任的报道和使用的指南（CANGARU）计划，旨在促进跨学科的全球共识，关于在学术界对GAI/GPT/LLM技术的道德使用、披露和适当报告。本协议包括四个不同的部分: a) 对GAI/GPT/LLM应用的持续系统性审查，以了解其关联性。",
    "tldr": "这个论文介绍了ChatGPT的开发和与之类似的生成人工智能和大型语言模型的广泛应用。为了解决关于它们如何道德应用、使用和披露的问题，提出了CANGARU指南。该指南旨在促进全球学术界对这些技术的道德使用、披露和适当报告的统一共识。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents the development of ChatGPT and its widespread use, along with other generative artificial intelligence and large language models. To address ethical concerns surrounding their application, use, and disclosure, the CANGARU guidelines are proposed as a global consensus in academia to ensure responsible usage, transparency, and accurate reporting of these technologies."
