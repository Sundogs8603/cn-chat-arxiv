    "translated_abstract": "推理自从人工智能的开始就是一个中心话题。近年来在分布式表示和神经网络上取得的进展持续改进了自然语言推理模型的最新性能。然而，这些模型是否通过真正的推理来得出结论，还是依赖于虚假的相关性，这仍然是一个未解决的问题。对抗性攻击已经证明是评估受害模型的致命弱点的重要工具。在这项研究中，我们探讨了基于逻辑形式主义开发攻击模型的基本问题。我们提出了NatLogAttack来执行围绕自然逻辑的系统性攻击，这是一个可追溯到亚里士多德三段论并且与自然语言推理密切相关的经典逻辑形式。该提议的框架可以进行保持标签和翻转标签的攻击。我们展示了与现有攻击模型相比，NatLogAttack产生了更好的对抗性攻击。",
