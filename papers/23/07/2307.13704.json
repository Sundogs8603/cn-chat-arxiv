    "abstract": "eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is now an important and essential part of machine learning, allowing to explain the predictions of complex models. XAI is especially required in risky applications, particularly in health care, where human lives depend on the decisions of AI systems. One area of medical research is age prediction and identification of biomarkers of aging and age-related diseases. However, the role of XAI in the age prediction task has not previously been explored directly. In this review, we discuss the application of XAI approaches to age prediction tasks. We give a systematic review of the works organized by body systems, and discuss the benefits of XAI in medical applications and, in particular, in the age prediction domain.",
