    "translated_abstract": "我们展示了胶体自组装的最小工作控制可以自然地在次序参数空间中以广义Schr\\\"odinger桥接问题的形式表达 - 这是一类在30年代末Erwin Schr\\\"odinger的作品中起源的固定时域随机最优控制问题。在近年来，这类问题在控制和机器学习社区中重新兴起了研究活动。与现有文献中关于这类问题的理论和计算有所不同，胶体自组装的控制漂移和扩散系数通常在控制方面是非线性的，且难以从基于物理建模中获得。我们推导了这类广义问题的最优性条件，并展示了导致的方程系统在结构上与现有结果完全不同，标准的计算方法不再适用。出于这个动机，我们提出了一个数据驱动的学习和控制框架。",
