    "abstract": "Social media use data is widely being used in health, psychology, and marketing research to analyze human behavior. However, we have very limited knowledge on social media use among American Indians. In this context, this study was designed to assess preferences and perceptions of social media use among American Indians during COVID-19. We collected data from American Indians in South Dakota using online survey. Results show that Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat are the most preferred social media platforms. Most of the participants reported that the use of social media increased tremendously during COVID-19 and had perceptions of more negative effects than positive effects. Hate/harassment/extremism, misinformation/made up news, and people getting one point of view were the top reasons for negative effects.",
