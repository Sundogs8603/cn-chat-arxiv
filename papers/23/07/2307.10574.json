    "translated_abstract": "由于建筑工作、资源和现金流量的复杂性和动态性，对它们的管理不善通常会导致时间和成本超支，甚至项目失败。现有的建筑方法未能在具有不确定性的动态环境中实现资源流动的最优控制。因此，本文引入了一种模型和方法，通过自适应控制资源流动来优化建筑项目的工作和现金流量。首先，建立了一个基于部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程的数学模型，以表达建筑工作、资源和现金流量的复杂相互作用，以及多种影响因素的不确定性和变异性。同时，为了高效地找到最优解，引入了基于深度强化学习（DRL）的方法，实现了对劳动力和物料流动的连续自适应最优控制，从而优化工作和现金流量。为了辅助DRL的训练过程，引入了一种模拟机制。",
