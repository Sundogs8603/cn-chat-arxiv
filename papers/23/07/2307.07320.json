    "translated_abstract": "顺序数据收集已成为增强数据收集过程效率的广泛采用的技术。尽管具有优势，但这种数据收集机制常常给统计推断过程引入复杂性。例如，在自适应线性回归模型中，普通最小二乘（OLS）估计量可能表现出非正态的渐近行为，从而对准确的推断和解释提出挑战。本文提出了一种构建去偏估计量的通用方法，该方法采用自适应线性估计方程的思想，并在理论上保证了渐近正态性，并讨论了实现近似最优渐近方差的问题。我们的估计量的一个显著特点是，在多臂老虎机的背景下，我们的估计量保留了最小二乘估计量的非渐近性能，同时获得了渐近正态性。因此，本工作解决了自适应线性回归模型中非正态渐近行为的问题，并为统计推断提供了可靠的方法。",
