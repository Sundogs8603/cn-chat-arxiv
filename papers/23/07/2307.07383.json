    "translated_abstract": "拓扑数据分析（TDA）已成为从复杂数据中提取有意义的见解的有力工具。TDA通过将对象嵌入到单纯复合中，并提取有用的全局属性，例如Betti数（即多维空洞的数量），从而增强了对对象的分析，这可以用于定义与现有机器学习算法轻松集成的内核方法。这些内核方法已经找到了广泛的应用，因为它们依赖于提供其性能的理论保证的强大数学框架。然而，经典硬件上计算高维Betti数可能会变得非常昂贵，而量子算法可以在多项式时间内近似计算它们。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于构建Betti曲线的量子方法来定义拓扑核，即随着阶数增加的拓扑指纹。我们展示了一个工作原型",
