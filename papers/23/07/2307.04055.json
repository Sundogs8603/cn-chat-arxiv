    "translated_abstract": "个性化定价是企业常用的一种针对个体特征制定价格的策略。在这个过程中，买家也可以通过操纵特征数据来获取更低的价格，但这也会导致特定的操作成本。这种策略行为可能会阻碍企业最大化利润。本文研究了具有策略性买家的情境动态定价问题。卖方无法观察到买家的真实特征，而只能观察到买家根据策略行为操纵后的特征。此外，卖方只能观察到买家对产品的估值，而无法直接获取具体数值，只能得到一个二进制的响应，表示是否发生销售。鉴于这些挑战，我们提出了一种策略动态定价策略，将买家的策略行为纳入在线学习中，以最大化卖方的累计收益。首先证明了现有的不考虑策略性的定价策略的存在限制。",
