    "abstract": "We introduce text2fabric, a novel dataset that links free-text descriptions to various fabric materials. The dataset comprises 15,000 natural language descriptions associated to 3,000 corresponding images of fabric materials. Traditionally, material descriptions come in the form of tags/keywords, which limits their expressivity, induces pre-existing knowledge of the appropriate vocabulary, and ultimately leads to a chopped description system. Therefore, we study the use of free-text as a more appropriate way to describe material appearance, taking the use case of fabrics as a common item that non-experts may often deal with. Based on the analysis of the dataset, we identify a compact lexicon, set of attributes and key structure that emerge from the descriptions. This allows us to accurately understand how people describe fabrics and draw directions for generalization to other types of materials. We also show that our dataset enables specializing large vision-language models such as CLI",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了text2fabric，一个将自由文本描述与各种面料材料关联起来的新数据集。该数据集包括15,000个自然语言描述，并与3,000个相应的面料材料图像相关联。传统上，材料描述以标签/关键字的形式出现，这限制了它们的表达能力，引入了对适当词汇的已有知识，并最终导致了一种被切割的描述系统。因此，我们研究了使用自由文本来描述材料外观的更适当方式，将面料作为非专家经常处理的常见物品使用案例。通过对数据集的分析，我们确定了从描述中得出的紧凑词汇、属性集合和关键结构。这使我们能够准确理解人们如何描述面料，并为推广到其他类型的材料提供指导。我们还展示了我们的数据集可以使大型视觉-语言模型（如CLI）专门化。",
