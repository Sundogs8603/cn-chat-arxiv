    "translated_abstract": "对于三维医学图像的体积标记需要专业知识且耗时，因此对于有限标记数据，半监督学习（SSL）是非常理想的。不平衡的类别分布是一个严重问题，制约了这些方法在现实世界应用中的进展，但却没有得到充分解决。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的双去偏异构联合训练（DHC）框架，用于半监督三维医学图像分割。具体而言，我们提出了两种损失加权策略，即分布感知去偏权重（DistDW）和难度感知去偏权重（DiffDW），利用伪标签动态引导模型解决数据和学习偏见。通过联合训练这两个多样且准确的子模型，框架显著提高了性能。我们还引入了更具代表性的类别不平衡半监督医学图像分割基准，充分展示了该框架的有效性。",
