    "translated_abstract": "我们分析了Fermat距离的收敛性质，这是一类在具有关联概率测度的Riemann流形上定义的密度驱动度量。Fermat距离可以在离散采样上定义，此时它们是随机的；也可以在连续设置中定义，此时它们由密度扭曲的Riemann度量下的测地线导出。我们证明了基于离散采样的Fermat距离在小邻域中收敛于它们的连续模拟，收敛速率取决于数据的内在维度和Fermat距离中密度加权的参数。这是通过利用新颖的几何和统计论证在渗流理论中允许非均匀密度和曲面域的方法完成的。然后，我们利用这些结果证明了基于离散，采样驱动的Fermat距离的离散图拉普拉斯算子收敛于相应的连续算子。",
