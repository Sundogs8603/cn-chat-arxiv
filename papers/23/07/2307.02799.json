    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种使用张量到矩阵回归进行少样本个性化显著性预测的方法，以保留个性化显著性图（PSM）的结构全局信息。与一般的显著性图相比，PSM具有巨大的潜力，因为它的映射指示了个体特定的视觉注意力，对于从凝视区域的异质性中获取个体视觉偏好非常有用。PSM的预测是为了获取未见图像的PSM，但由于个体凝视模式的复杂性，其预测仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务。为了从有限的眼动数据中识别个体凝视模式，先前的方法采用个体之间凝视趋势的相似性。然而，在先前的方法中，PSMs被向量化以适应预测模型，从而忽视了与图像对应的PSMs的结构全局信息。为了自动揭示PSMs之间的关系，我们聚焦于...",
