    "translated_abstract": "级联是一种经典的策略，可以实现适应性地在样本之间变化的推理成本，其中按顺序调用一系列分类器。延迟规则确定是否调用序列中的下一个分类器，或者终止预测。一种简单的延迟规则利用当前分类器的置信度，例如基于最大预测的softmax概率。尽管对级联结构不敏感——例如不建模下游模型的错误——但这种基于置信度的延迟经常在实践中表现出色。在本文中，我们旨在更好地理解基于置信度的延迟可能失败的条件，以及何时备选的延迟策略可能更好。我们首先对最优延迟规则进行了理论表征，精确地描述了基于置信度的延迟可能受到影响的设置。然后我们研究了事后延迟机制，并验证它们可以显著提高性能。",
