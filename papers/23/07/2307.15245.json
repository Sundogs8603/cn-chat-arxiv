    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，联邦学习（FL）一直是研究的热点领域。已经有许多研究在处理数据异质性时对FL进行了改进。然而，尽管存在许多论文，但该领域的进展状况是未知的。许多研究采用了不一致的实验设置，并且没有对FL特定实验变量对结果的影响进行全面的研究，也没有提供一个更可比性和一致性的FL实验设置的实践见解。此外，存在多个基准和混杂变量进一步增加了不一致性和不确定性。在这项工作中，我们首次对FL特定实验变量与彼此之间和性能结果的影响进行了全面研究，提供了一些见解和建议，为设计有意义和具有良好激励机制的FL实验设置。我们还通过发布FedZoo-Bench来帮助社区，",
