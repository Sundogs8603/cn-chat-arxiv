    "translated_abstract": "本文提供了Earley (1970)的上下文无关语法分析算法的参考描述，包括多种加速方法。我们的演示包括从Earley的$O(N^3|G||R|)$到$O(N^3|G|)$的已知最坏情况运行时改进，后者可以解决自然语言处理中出现的大规模语法的问题。其中，$N$是句子的长度，$|R|$是$G$中的产生式数量，$|G|$是这些产生式的总长度。当以单个有限状态自动机$M$的紧凑表示方式表示语法时，我们还提供了运行时为$O(N^3|M|)$，其中$|M|\\leq|G|$的版本（部分是新颖的）。我们仔细处理了半环加权推理的泛化问题，对语法进行预处理以消除推理循环，并进一步推广了Stolcke (1995)的方法以计算句子前缀的权重。",
