We use SRPNet with the cross-entropy method to predict actions that are effective at revealing space beneath plant foliage.

    "translated_abstract": "自主农业应用（例如检查、表型分析、采摘水果）需要操作植物叶片以查看叶子和枝干的背后。部分可见性、极端杂乱、薄结构以及植物的未知几何和动力学都使得这种操作具有挑战性。我们通过数据驱动的方法解决了这些挑战。我们使用自我监督来训练SRPNet，一个神经网络，该网络预测在给定植物上执行候选动作时会显露出多少空间。我们使用带有交叉熵方法的SRPNet来预测有效地显露出植物叶片下的空间的动作。此外，由于SRPNet不仅预测显露出多少空间，还预测显露出空间的位置，因此我们可以执行一系列动作，逐步显露出更多的植物叶片下的空间。在物理测试平台上，我们对合成的藤蔓和真实植物（龙血树）进行了实验，涵盖了5个设置，包括2个测试泛化性能的设置。",
