    "abstract": "This research investigates the effectiveness of ChatGPT, an AI language model by OpenAI, in translating English into Hindi, Telugu, and Kannada languages, aimed at assisting tourists in India's linguistically diverse environment. To measure the translation quality, a test set of 50 questions from diverse fields such as general knowledge, food, and travel was used. These were assessed by five volunteers for accuracy and fluency, and the scores were subsequently converted into a BLEU score. The BLEU score evaluates the closeness of a machine-generated translation to a human translation, with a higher score indicating better translation quality. The Hindi translations outperformed others, showcasing superior accuracy and fluency, whereas Telugu translations lagged behind. Human evaluators rated both the accuracy and fluency of translations, offering a comprehensive perspective on the language model's performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究调查了OpenAI的AI语言模型ChatGPT在将英语翻译成印地语、泰卢固语和卡纳达语方面的有效性，旨在帮助印度多语言环境中的游客。为了评估翻译质量，使用了包括常识、食物和旅行等领域的50个问题的测试集。这些问题由五名志愿者评估其准确性和流畅性，并将得分转换为BLEU分数。BLEU分数评估机器生成的翻译与人工翻译的接近程度，较高的分数表示更好的翻译质量。结果显示印地语翻译优于其他语言，准确性和流畅性更好，而泰卢固语翻译落后。人工评估员评价了翻译的准确性和流畅性，为语言模型的表现提供了全面的视角。",
