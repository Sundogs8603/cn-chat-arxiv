    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型在从训练数据中学习复杂模式和概念方面展示出了显著的能力。然而，最近的研究发现这些模型倾向于过分依赖于图片背景中的简单和容易识别的特征，而不是它们本应分类的主要概念或对象。这种现象给图像分类器带来了挑战，因为图片中的关键元素可能会被掩盖。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法来解决这个问题并改善图像分类器对主要概念的学习。我们的核心思想是在分类任务过程中同时引导模型的注意力向前景集中。通过强调前景，即主要感兴趣的对象，我们旨在将模型的注意力从背景的主导影响上转移开来。为了实现这一点，我们引入了一种机制来鼓励模型足够地分配注意力给前景。",
