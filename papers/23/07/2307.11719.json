    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱表示关于现实世界实体的事实，其中大多数事实被定义为正面陈述。负面陈述在开放世界假设下非常稀缺但高度相关。此外，已经证明它们可以改善多个应用程序的性能，特别是在生物医学领域。然而，目前没有支持考虑这些负面陈述的方法评估的基准数据集存在。我们提供了三个关系预测任务的数据集，包括蛋白质-蛋白质相互作用预测、基因-疾病关联预测和疾病预测，旨在解决构建具有负面陈述的知识图谱基准的困难。这些数据集包括来自两个成功的生物医学本体，基因本体和人类表型本体的数据，并添加了负面陈述。我们还使用两种流行的基于路径的方法为每个数据集生成了知识图谱嵌入，并评估了其性能。",
