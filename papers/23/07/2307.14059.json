    "translated_abstract": "当代基于网络的平台向用户展示排名列表的推荐内容，以尝试最大化用户满意度或业务指标。这些系统的目标通常是最大化被认为是“最大化奖励”的项目的曝光概率。这个通用框架包括流媒体应用、电子商务或职位推荐，甚至网络搜索。在每种用例中，可以使用位置偏差或用户模型来估计曝光概率，这些模型可以根据用户与展示的排名的互动方式进行特定调整。这些不同的问题设置中的一个统一因素是，通常只有一个或几个项目会在用户离开排序列表之前被参与（点击、流媒体等）。社交媒体平台上的短视频推送在几个方面与这种一般框架不同，最重要的是用户在点赞一篇帖子后通常不会离开推送。实际上，看似无限的推送引导用户滚动浏览视频。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种概率位置偏差模型，用于解决社交媒体平台上短视频推荐中的问题。这种模型考虑了用户在浏览视频时的行为特点，能够更准确地估计每个视频的曝光概率。"
