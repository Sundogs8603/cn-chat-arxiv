    "translated_abstract": "生物医学研究的进展严重依赖于大量医学数据的获取。在组织病理学的情况下，全切片图像（WSI）和临床病理学信息对于开发数字病理学（DP）的人工智能（AI）算法非常有价值。将医学数据传输“尽量开放”提高了数据用于次级目的的可用性，但同时也对患者隐私构成风险。同时，现有法规要求保持医学数据“尽量封闭”以避免再识别风险。通常，这些法规要求删除敏感数据，但不考虑现代图像匹配算法可能导致的数据链接攻击的可能性。此外，DP的标准化不足使得在所有WSI格式上建立单一解决方案变得更加困难。这些挑战给生物信息学研究者在开发AI算法时在隐私与进步之间取得平衡带来了问题。本文探讨了这些挑战，并提出了一些解决方案。",
