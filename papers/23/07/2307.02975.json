    "abstract": "Disease detection from smartphone data represents an open research challenge in mobile health (m-health) systems. COVID-19 and its respiratory symptoms are an important case study in this area and their early detection is a potential real instrument to counteract the pandemic situation. The efficacy of this solution mainly depends on the performances of AI algorithms applied to the collected data and their possible implementation directly on the users' mobile devices. Considering these issues, and the limited amount of available data, in this paper we present the experimental evaluation of 3 different deep learning models, compared also with hand-crafted features, and of two main approaches of transfer learning in the considered scenario: both feature extraction and fine-tuning. Specifically, we considered VGGish, YAMNET, and L\\textsuperscript{3}-Net (including 12 different configurations) evaluated through user-independent experiments on 4 different datasets (13,447 samples in total).",

    "translated_abstract": "从智能手机数据中检测疾病是移动健康（m-health）系统中的一个开放性研究挑战。COVID-19及其呼吸症状是该领域的一个重要案例研究，在这个领域的早期检测是对抗大流行病的一个潜在有效手段。该解决方案的有效性主要取决于应用于收集数据的AI算法的性能以及其可能直接在用户手机上实施。考虑到这些问题和有限的可用数据量，本文通过与手工制作的特征进行比较，展示了三种不同的深度学习模型（VGGish，YAMNET和L3-Net）的实验评估以及在所考虑的场景中的两种主要迁移学习方法：特征提取和微调。具体而言，我们通过在4个不同数据集（总共13,447个样本）上进行独立用户实验来评估12个不同配置的模型。",
