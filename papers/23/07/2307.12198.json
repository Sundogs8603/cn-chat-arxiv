    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型在表格数据分析中变得流行，因为它们解决了决策树的局限性，并实现了半监督学习、在线学习和迁移学习等有价值的应用。然而，这些深度学习方法通常会遇到一个折衷。一方面，当处理大规模或高维数据集时，它们可能计算量很大。另一方面，它们可能缺乏可解释性，不适用于小规模数据集。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的可解释性神经网络，称为神经分类与回归树（NCART），以克服这些挑战。NCART是残差网络的变体，它将全连接层替换为多个可微性的无视决策树。通过将决策树集成到架构中，NCART保持其可解释性，同时又能从神经网络的端到端能力中受益。NCART架构的简洁性",
