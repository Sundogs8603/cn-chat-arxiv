    "translated_abstract": "心肌梗死（MI）是最常见的心血管疾病之一，相关的临床决策通常基于单值成像生物标志物。然而，这样的指标只是近似了心脏的复杂3D结构和生理特性，从而阻碍了对MI结果的更好理解和预测。在这项工作中，我们研究了完整的3D心脏形状（以点云形式）在改善MI事件检测方面的实用性。为此，我们提出了一个完全自动化的多步骤流程，包括3D心脏表面重建步骤和点云分类网络。我们的方法利用了点云几何深度学习在高分辨率心脏解剖模型上的直接和高效多尺度学习。我们在1068个英国生物银行受试者上评估了我们的方法，用于常见MI检测和新发MI预测的任务，并发现分别改进了约13%和约5%。",
