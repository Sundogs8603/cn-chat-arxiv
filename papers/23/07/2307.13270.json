    "translated_abstract": "训练人工神经网络的一种生物学合理的方法是将每个单元视为随机强化学习代理，从而将网络视为代理团队。因此，所有单元都可以通过REINFORCE进行学习，这是一种局部学习规则，通过全局奖励信号进行调节，更加符合生物观察到的突触可塑性形式。然而，由于缺乏有效的结构性信用分配，这种学习方法通常速度较慢，且随着网络规模的增大而扩展性较差，因为单个奖励信号被广播给所有单元而不考虑个体贡献。提出的解决方案，重量最大化，用出站权重的范数替换单元的奖励信号，从而允许每个隐藏单元最大化出站权重的范数，而不是全局奖励信号。在本研究报告中，我们分析了重量最大化的理论属性并提出了一种变体，无偏重量最大化。",
