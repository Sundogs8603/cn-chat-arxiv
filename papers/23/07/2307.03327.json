    "abstract": "This work presents the first applications of self-supervised learning applied to data from digital antenna arrays. Encoder-decoder networks are pretrained on digital array data to perform a self-supervised noisy-reconstruction task called channel in-painting, in which the network infers the contents of array data that has been masked with zeros. The self-supervised step requires no human-labeled data. The encoder architecture and weights from pretraining are then transferred to a new network with a task-specific decoder, and the new network is trained on a small volume of labeled data. We show that pretraining on the unlabeled data allows the new network to perform the task of bandwidth regression on the digital array data better than an equivalent network that is trained on the same labeled data from random initialization.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究首次将自监督学习应用于数字天线阵列数据，并采用编码器-解码器网络对数字阵列数据进行预训练，执行一种称为信道修复的自监督噪声重构任务，即网络推断被零掩盖的阵列数据的内容。自监督步骤不需要人工标记数据。然后，将预训练的编码器架构和权重转移到具有特定任务解码器的新网络，并在少量标记数据上对新网络进行训练。我们证明，对未标记数据进行预训练使得新网络在数字阵列数据的带宽回归任务中比从随机初始化训练的等效网络表现更好。",
