    "translated_abstract": "被遗忘权（RTBF）最初是由谷歌西班牙与埃克斯内塔索委员会(Mario Costeja Gonz\\'alez)之间的官司结果而确立的，并且后来被作为欧洲联盟一般数据保护条例（GDPR）下的删除权。RTBF允许个人向组织请求删除个人数据，特别是对于搜索引擎，个人可以向组织发送请求，排除他们的信息在查询结果中出现。然而，随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展和其在聊天机器人中的应用，LLM启用的软件系统变得越来越受欢迎。但它们并没有被排除在RTBF之外。相比搜索引擎使用的索引方法，LLMs以一种完全不同的方式存储和处理信息，这为符合RTBF提出了新的挑战。在本文中，我们探讨了这些挑战，并提供了关于如何实施技术解决方案以符合RTBF的见解。",
