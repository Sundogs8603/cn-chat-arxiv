    "abstract": "Recent work in the field of symbolic music generation has shown value in using a tokenization based on the GuitarPro format, a symbolic representation supporting guitar expressive attributes, as an input and output representation. We extend this work by fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer model on ProgGP, a custom dataset of 173 progressive metal songs, for the purposes of creating compositions from that genre through a human-AI partnership. Our model is able to generate multiple guitar, bass guitar, drums, piano and orchestral parts. We examine the validity of the generated music using a mixed methods approach by combining quantitative analyses following a computational musicology paradigm and qualitative analyses following a practice-based research paradigm. Finally, we demonstrate the value of the model by using it as a tool to create a progressive metal song, fully produced and mixed by a human metal producer based on AI-generated music.",

    "translated_abstract": "在符号音乐生成领域的最新研究中，使用基于GuitarPro格式的分词作为输入和输出的符号表示，支持吉他表达属性，已经显示出价值。我们通过在ProgGP上对预训练的Transformer模型进行微调，扩展了这项工作，这是一个包含173首渐进金属歌曲的自定义数据集，目的是通过人工智能合作创造出该流派的作品。我们的模型能够生成多个吉他、贝斯吉他、鼓、钢琴和管弦乐部分。我们通过计算音乐学范式的数量分析和实践研究范式的质性分析相结合的混合方法来检验生成音乐的有效性。最后，我们通过将其用作工具，由人类金属音乐制作人基于AI生成的音乐进行全面制作和混音，展示了该模型的价值。",
