    "translated_abstract": "近年来，训练无注释图像字幕生成器取得了进展。先前的方法可以分为两种策略：从不匹配的语料库中获取句子，并将其与给定的图像对齐作为伪注释，或者使用外部的图像-文本对对生成器进行预训练。然而，由于对齐的设置存在质量问题，其性能似乎已经达到了极限，而预训练需要大量的计算资源。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新的策略“LPM + 检索增强学习”，利用来自大规模预训练模型（LPM）的先验知识作为监督，并整合检索过程以进一步增强其效力。具体而言，我们引入了检索增强的伪句子生成（RaPSG），采用高效的方法从不匹配的语料库中检索出高相关的短区域描述，并将其用于生成多样的句子。",
