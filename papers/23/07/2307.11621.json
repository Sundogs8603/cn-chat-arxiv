    "translated_abstract": "双分区极化问题是一个优化问题，目标是在表示通过社交网络发展起来的辩论的带权重和标签的图上找到最高极化的双分区。图中的节点代表用户的观点，边代表用户之间的一致或不一致。这个问题可以看作是最大割问题的一种推广，在之前的工作中已经找到了一些近似解和精确解，这些解是从Reddit的讨论中得到的，这表明这些实例似乎很容易解决。在本文中，我们通过引入一个实例生成模型来进一步研究该问题的复杂性，该模型的一个参数控制了实例的极化程度，而这与解决这些实例的平均复杂度有关。我们得到的平均复杂度的结果与我们的假设一致：实例的极化程度越高，找到对应的解越容易。",

The results suggest that higher polarization levels make the problem easier to solve."
