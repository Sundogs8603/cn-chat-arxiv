    "translated_abstract": "科学论文中的致谢部分可能揭示科学社区的某些方面，比如奖励体系、合作模式和隐藏的研究趋势。该论文旨在评估不同嵌入模型在科学论文致谢文本中自动提取和分类被致谢实体的性能。我们使用Flair NLP框架进行命名实体识别（NER）任务的训练和实现。训练使用了三个默认的Flair NER模型，使用四个不同大小的语料库和不同版本的Flair NLP框架进行。在最新的FLAIR版本上，使用中等规模的语料库训练的Flair嵌入模型显示出了最好的准确性，为0.79。将训练语料库的规模从非常小的扩展到中等规模大大提高了所有训练算法的准确性，但进一步扩大训练语料库并没有带来进一步的改善。此外，嵌入模型的性能在其他Embeddings选项上没有显著差异。",
