    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们研究了一个众所周知且具有挑战性的多智能体路径规划问题，当一组智能体被限制在一个图中，每个智能体被分配一个唯一的起始和目标顶点，任务是找到一组无碰撞路径（每个智能体一个路径），使得每个智能体都达到其相应的目标。我们研究如何利用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）解决该问题。虽然MCTS已被证明在广泛的问题上表现出卓越的性能，如对弈游戏（例如，围棋、国际象棋等） 的对弈，发现更快的矩阵乘法算法等，但其在此问题上的应用尚未得到充分研究。为此，我们引入了一种针对多智能体路径规划的原创变种MCTS。我们方法的关键是如何计算指导 MCTS 的奖励。具体而言，我们使用各自的路径来辅助智能体实现目标达成行为，并允许它们在需要时离开路径避免碰撞。",
