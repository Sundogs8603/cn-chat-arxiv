    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLMs）在各个领域展示了其出色的能力，彻底改变了自然语言处理任务。然而，它们在职位推荐中对行为图的理解潜力仍然未被充分探索。本文旨在揭示大规模语言模型在理解行为图方面的能力，并利用这种理解来提升在线招聘中的推荐，包括促进非分布式的应用。我们提出了一个新的框架，利用大规模语言模型提供的丰富上下文信息和语义表示来分析行为图并揭示其中的潜在模式和关系。具体而言，我们提出了一个元路径提示构造器，利用LLM推荐器首次理解行为图，并设计了相应的路径增强模块来缓解基于路径的序列输入引入的提示偏差。通过利用将LM的特点引入到行为图的大规模数据分析中，我们取得了显著的实验结果，证明了我们提出的方法的有效性和性能。",
