    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to assist students with dyslexia, ADHD, and short attention span in digesting any text-based information more efficiently. The proposed solution utilizes the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm for complex text processing and summarization tasks. The tool leverages the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model from Hugging Face, which treats every NLP task as a text generation task. The model is fine-tuned on specific tasks using a smaller dataset. The NLTK's Punkt Sentence Tokenizer is used to divide a text into a list of sentences. The application is served using Flask, a lightweight web server and framework. The tool also applies principles from Bionic Reading to enhance readability, which includes a bolding function and adjustments to line, word, and character spacing. The paper discusses the methodology, implementation, and results of the AI-based speed reading tool.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的方法，用于帮助患有诵读困难、ADHD和注意力不集中的学生更高效地消化任何基于文本的信息。所提出的解决方案利用了多层感知机（MLP）算法进行复杂文本处理和摘要任务。该工具利用了Hugging Face的T5（文本到文本转换器）模型，将每个自然语言处理任务视为文本生成任务。模型使用较小的数据集对特定任务进行微调。NLTK的Punkt句子分词器用于将文本分割为句子列表。应用程序使用轻量级Web服务器和框架Flask提供。该工具还应用了仿生阅读的原则来增强可读性，包括加粗功能和对行、单词和字符间距的调整。本文讨论了基于人工智能的速读工具的方法、实现和结果。",
