    "translated_abstract": "最近提出了几种深度学习（DL）方法用于在输尿管镜检查期间自动识别肾结石，以便快速进行治疗决策。尽管这些DL方法取得了有希望的结果，但它们主要适用于有大量标记数据的肾结石类型。然而，对于一些罕见的肾结石类型，只有很少的标记图像可用。本文利用深度度量学习（DML）方法来处理这些样本稀缺的类别，并且能够很好地推广到分布样本之外，并且对于添加到数据库的新类别能够有更好的应对能力。所提出的引导式深度度量学习方法基于一种新颖的架构，设计了一种更好地学习数据表示的方式。解决方案受到少样本学习（FSL）的启发，并采用了师生模型的方法。师模型（GEMINI）基于已知标签的先验知识生成了一个缩小的假设空间",
