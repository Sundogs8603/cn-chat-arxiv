    "translated_abstract": "选择建模是许多经济学、运营和营销问题的核心。在本文中，我们提出了一种对选择函数进行基本特征化的方法，涵盖了各种现有的选择模型。我们展示了非参数估计器如神经网络如何能够轻松逼近此类函数，并克服在非参数估计选择函数中固有的维数灾难。通过大量模拟，我们证明了我们提出的函数可以以完全数据驱动的方式灵活捕捉潜在的消费者行为，并胜过传统的参数模型。因为需求设置常常具有内生特征，我们将我们的框架扩展到包括在内生特征下的估计。此外，我们还描述了一个形式推理程序，以构建关于价格弹性等感兴趣对象的有效置信区间。最后，为了评估我们估计器的实际适用性，我们利用了一个真实世界的实证数据集。",
