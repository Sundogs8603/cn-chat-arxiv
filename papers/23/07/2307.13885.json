    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型通常需要对噪声输入数据具有鲁棒性。现实世界中的噪声（通常是随机的）对模型预测的影响可以通过模型的局部鲁棒性来捕捉，即在输入周围的局部区域内模型预测的一致性。然而，基于蒙特卡罗采样的计算局部鲁棒性的朴素方法在统计上是低效的，对于大规模应用而言计算成本高昂。在这项工作中，我们通过局部线性函数逼近和多元正态CDF开发了首个分析估计器，以高效计算多类别判别模型的局部鲁棒性。通过这些估计器的推导，我们展示了局部鲁棒性与随机平滑和softmax概率等概念的联系。我们还通过实验证实这些估计器准确且高效地计算了标准深度学习模型的局部鲁棒性。",
