Existing defense strategies primarily focus on using reverse engineering to reproduce the backdoor trigger generated by attackers and subsequently repair the DNN model by adding the trigger into inputs and fine-tuning the model with ground-truth labels. However, once the trigger generated by the attackers is complex and invisible, the defender can not successfully reproduce the trigger. Consequently, the DNN model will not be repaired since the trigger is not effectively removed.  In this work, we propose Feature Map Testing~(FMT).

    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络广泛应用于许多关键应用，如自动驾驶车辆和医学诊断。然而，它们的安全性受到后门攻击的威胁，后门攻击是通过向特定训练数据中添加人工模式实现的。现有的防御策略主要集中在使用逆向工程来复现攻击者生成的后门触发器，并通过将触发器添加到输入中并使用真实标签微调模型来修复DNN模型。然而，一旦攻击者生成的触发器复杂而且不可见，防御者就无法成功复现触发器。因此，由于触发器没有被有效去除，DNN模型将无法被修复。在这项工作中，我们提出了特征图测试（FMT）方法。与现有的防御策略不同，它们专注于复现后门触发器，FMT试图检测训练用于从输入中提取后门信息的后门特征图。",
