    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在对可实现回归在PAC学习和在线学习的统计复杂度进行刻画。先前的研究已经证明了有限的fat shattering维度对于PAC学习的充分性以及有限的scaled Natarajan维度对于必要性的存在，但自从Simon 1997（SICOMP '97）的工作以来，对于更完整的刻画的进展甚少。为此，我们首先引入了一种最小化实例最优学习算法来对可实现回归进行学习，并提出了一种既定性又定量地刻画了哪些类的实数预测器可以被学习的新颖维度。然后，我们确定了一个与图维度相关的组合维度，该维度刻画了在可实现设置中的ERM可学习性。最后，我们根据与DS维度相关的组合维度建立了学习可行性的必要条件，并猜测它也可能是充分的。",
