    "translated_abstract": "异构信息网络(HINs)是具有多种节点类型和边类型的信息网络。元路径的概念即一系列连接两个实体的实体类型和关系类型的序列被提出为提供对不同HIN任务的元级可解释语义的一种方法。传统上，元路径主要用于模式简单的HINs，例如只有少量实体类型的文献网络，在这种情况下，元路径通常通过领域知识枚举。然而，元路径在模式复杂的HINs(例如具有数百种实体和关系类型的知识库)中的应用受到了由元路径枚举引起的计算复杂性的限制。此外，有效评估元路径需要枚举相关路径实例，这进一步增加了元路径学习过程的复杂性。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种用于模式复杂的HINs的归纳元路径学习框架SchemaWalk。",
