    "translated_abstract": "模仿学习在视觉机器人操作中为何难以泛化？这个问题并不容易解决，但从机器人的视角来看，环境通常可以分解为可以枚举的变化因素，例如光照条件或摄像机的摆放位置。在实证上，对于这些因素的泛化比其他因素更具挑战性，但现有的工作很少涉及到每个因素对泛化差距的贡献有多大。为了回答这个问题，我们在仿真环境和实际机器人语言条件下的操作任务中研究模仿学习策略，以量化不同（集合）因素的泛化困难程度。我们还设计了一个新的仿真基准，包含19个任务和11个变化因素，以便更好地进行泛化的控制性评估。通过我们的研究，我们确定了基于泛化困难度的因素排序，这是一致的。",
