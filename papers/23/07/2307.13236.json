    "abstract": "The goal of the audio-visual segmentation (AVS) task is to segment the sounding objects in the video frames using audio cues. However, current fusion-based methods have the performance limitations due to the small receptive field of convolution and inadequate fusion of audio-visual features. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel \\textbf{Au}dio-aware query-enhanced \\textbf{TR}ansformer (AuTR) to tackle the task. Unlike existing methods, our approach introduces a multimodal transformer architecture that enables deep fusion and aggregation of audio-visual features. Furthermore, we devise an audio-aware query-enhanced transformer decoder that explicitly helps the model focus on the segmentation of the pinpointed sounding objects based on audio signals, while disregarding silent yet salient objects. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous methods and demonstrates better generalization ability in multi-sound and open-set scenarios.",

    "translated_abstract": "音频-视觉分割（AVS）任务的目标是使用音频线索在视频帧中对发声对象进行分割。然而，当前基于融合的方法由于卷积的小感受野和音频-视觉特征不充分的融合而存在性能限制。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的声音感知的查询增强的变形器（AuTR）来应对这个任务。与现有方法不同，我们的方法引入了一种多模态变形器架构，能够深度融合和聚合音频-视觉特征。此外，我们设计了一种声音感知的查询增强的变形器解码器，明确地帮助模型在基于音频信号的定位发声对象的分割时聚焦，同时忽略寂静但显著的对象。实验结果表明，我们的方法优于先前的方法，并在多声音和开放性场景中展示出更好的泛化能力。",
