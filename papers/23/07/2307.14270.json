We tackle this question by considering an occupation model in the spirit of the Sakoda-Schelling model, historically introduced to shed light on segregation dynamics among human groups. For a large class of utility functions and decision rules, we pinpoint the nonequilibrium nature of the agent dynamics, while recovering the equilibrium-like phase separation phenomenology. Within the mean field approximation we show how the model can be mapped, to some extent, onto an active matter field description (Active Model B). Finally, we consider non-reciprocal interactions between two populations, and show how they can lead to non-steady macroscopic behavior. We believe our approach provides a unifying framework to further study geography-dependent agent-based models, notably paving the way for joint consideration of population and price dynamics within a field theoretic approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "代理人的决策规则对于社会经济代理人模型有多么稳健？我们通过考虑一种类似Sakoda-Schelling模型的职业模型来解决这个问题，该模型在历史上被引入以揭示人类群体之间的隔离动力学。对于大类的效用函数和决策规则，我们确定了代理人动力学的非平衡性，同时恢复了类似平衡相分离的现象学。在平均场近似下，我们展示了该模型在一定程度上可以被映射为主动物质场描述（Active Model B）。最后，我们考虑了两个人群之间的非互惠性互动，并展示了它们如何导致非稳态的宏观行为。我们相信我们的方法提供了一个统一的框架，进一步研究地理相关的基于代理人的模型，尤其是在场论方法中同时考虑人口和价格动态的研究。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates the non-equilibrium dynamics of socioeconomic agent-based models using an occupation model inspired by the Sakoda-Schelling model. The study maps the model to an active matter field description and explores the effects of non-reciprocal interactions. The findings provide a unified framework for studying geography-dependent agent-based models and considering population and price dynamics."
