    "abstract": "The demand for psychological counseling has grown significantly in recent years, particularly with the global outbreak of COVID-19, which has heightened the need for timely and professional mental health support. Online psychological counseling has emerged as the predominant mode of providing services in response to this demand. In this study, we propose the Psy-LLM framework, an AI-based system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for question-answering in online psychological consultation. Our framework combines pre-trained LLMs with real-world professional Q&A from psychologists and extensively crawled psychological articles. The Psy-LLM framework serves as a front-end tool for healthcare professionals, allowing them to provide immediate responses and mindfulness activities to alleviate patient stress. Additionally, it functions as a screening tool to identify urgent cases requiring further assistance. We evaluated the framework using intrinsic metrics, such as perplexity, and ex",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，心理咨询的需求显著增长，特别是随着全球COVID-19的爆发，这加强了及时和专业的心理健康支持的需求。在线心理咨询成为应对这一需求的主要服务方式。在本研究中，我们提出了Psy-LLM框架，这是一种基于人工智能的系统，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行在线心理咨询中的问答。我们的框架结合了经过预训练的LLMs和从心理学家和广泛收集的心理文章中获取的真实世界专业问答。Psy-LLM框架作为医疗专业人员的前端工具，允许他们提供即时响应和正念活动来缓解患者压力，同时还可以作为筛查工具，识别需要进一步协助的紧急案例。我们使用困惑度等内在度量标准和外部度量标准对框架进行了评估。",
