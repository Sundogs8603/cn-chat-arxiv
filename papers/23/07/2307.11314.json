    "translated_abstract": "脉冲神经网络(SNNs)是具有高能效的生物合理计算模型。神经元和突触的时间动态使其能够检测时间模式并生成序列。传统上使用时间反向传播(BPTT)来训练SNNs，但对于嵌入式应用的在线学习来说，BPTT不适合，因为它具有高计算和存储成本以及延迟时间较长。以前的研究提出了在线学习算法，但它们通常使用高度简化的脉冲神经元模型，没有突触动力学和重置反馈，导致性能不佳。在这项工作中，我们提出了适用于在线学习LIF神经元组成的SNNs的时空在线学习算法(SOLSA)，该算法具有指数衰减的突触和软重置。该算法不仅可以学习突触权重，还可以调整与突触相关的时间滤波器。与BPTT算法相比，SOLSA算法不仅在性能上更优秀，而且通过适应性学习实现较低的计算和存储成本。",
