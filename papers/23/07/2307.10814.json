    "translated_abstract": "在常规的语音情绪识别（SER）任务中，针对给定语言的分类器是在该语言现有的数据集上进行训练的。然而，在某些语言缺乏训练数据的情况下，可以使用其他语言的数据。我们尝试了跨语言和多语种的SER，使用了阿姆哈拉语、英语、德语和乌尔都语。对于阿姆哈拉语，我们使用了我们自己提供的阿姆哈拉语情绪语音数据集（ASED）。对于英语、德语和乌尔都语，我们使用了现有的RAVDESS、EMO-DB和URDU数据集。我们遵循了以前的研究，将所有数据集的标签映射为两个类别：积极和消极。因此，我们可以直接比较不同语言的性能，并将不同语言用于训练和测试。在第一实验中，使用三个分类器（AlexNet、VGGE和ResNet50）进行了单语种SER试验。对于ASED和RAVDESS，三个模型的平均结果非常相似，这表明阿姆哈拉语和英语在情绪识别上的表现相似。",
