    "abstract": "Recent works on 6D object pose estimation focus on learning keypoint correspondences between images and object models, and then determine the object pose through RANSAC-based algorithms or by directly regressing the pose with end-to-end optimisations. We argue that learning point-level discriminative features is overlooked in the literature. To this end, we revisit Fully Convolutional Geometric Features (FCGF) and tailor it for object 6D pose estimation to achieve state-of-the-art performance. FCGF employs sparse convolutions and learns point-level features using a fully-convolutional network by optimising a hardest contrastive loss. We can outperform recent competitors on popular benchmarks by adopting key modifications to the loss and to the input data representations, by carefully tuning the training strategies, and by employing data augmentations suitable for the underlying problem. We carry out a thorough ablation to study the contribution of each modification.",

    "translated_abstract": "近期关于6D物体姿态估计的研究主要集中在学习图像和物体模型之间的关键点对应，并通过基于RANSAC的算法或直接通过端到端优化回归姿态来确定物体姿态。我们认为文献中忽视了学习逐点判别特征。为此，我们重新审视了全卷积几何特征（FCGF），并将其定制为物体6D姿态估计，以实现最先进的性能。FCGF采用稀疏卷积，通过优化最难比较损失来学习逐点特征。通过对损失和输入数据表示进行关键修改、精心调整训练策略以及采用适合底层问题的数据增强，我们能够超越近期的竞争对手在流行的基准测试上取得更好的结果。我们进行了彻底的消融实验，研究了每个修改的贡献。",
