    "abstract": "The use of argumentation in education has been shown to improve critical thinking skills for end-users such as students, and computational models for argumentation have been developed to assist in this process. Although these models are useful for evaluating the quality of an argument, they oftentimes cannot explain why a particular argument is considered poor or not, which makes it difficult to provide constructive feedback to users to strengthen their critical thinking skills. In this survey, we aim to explore the different dimensions of feedback (Richness, Visualization, Interactivity, and Personalization) provided by the current computational models for argumentation, and the possibility of enhancing the power of explanations of such models, ultimately helping learners improve their critical thinking skills.",

    "translated_abstract": "论证在教育中的应用已被证明可以提高学生等最终用户的批判性思维能力，并且已经开发了用于辅助该过程的论证的计算模型。尽管这些模型对于评估论证的质量非常有用，但往往无法解释为什么某个特定的论证被认为是差的或不好，这使得难以向用户提供有建设性的反馈来增强他们的批判性思维能力。在本调查中，我们旨在探索当前论证计算模型提供的不同反馈维度（丰富性、可视化、互动性和个性化），以及增强这些模型解释能力的可能性，最终帮助学习者提高批判性思维能力。",
