    "translated_abstract": "检测滑动的能力，特别是早期滑动的能力，使得机器人系统能够采取纠正措施，防止抓取的物体掉落。因此，滑动检测可以增强机器人抓取的整体安全性。然而，准确检测早期滑动仍然是一个重大挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于学习的方法，利用PapillArray（Contactile，澳大利亚）触觉传感器来检测早期滑动。所得模型在识别与早期滑动相关的模式方面具有很高的效果，在离线数据集测试时实现了95.6%的检测成功率。此外，我们引入了几种数据增强方法来增强我们模型的鲁棒性。当将训练好的模型转移到与训练数据采集环境不同的机器人抓取环境时，我们的模型保持了鲁棒的性能，成功率为96.8%，为稳定几种实际抓取提供及时反馈。",
