Recently, many spoken open-domain chatbots have been used as speaking partners, helping language learners improve their language skills.

This paper explores the use of GPT4 for ASR error correction in conversational settings. In addition to WER, we propose to use semantic textual similarity (STS) and next response sensibility (NRS) metrics to evaluate the impact of error correction models on the quality of the conversation. We find that transcriptions corrected by GPT4 lead to higher conversation quality, despite an increase in WER. GPT4 also outperforms standard error correction methods without the need for in-domain tr",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理技术（NLP）在教育应用中的整合已经显示出有希望的结果，特别是在语言学习领域。最近，许多口语开放领域的聊天机器人被用作口语伙伴，帮助语言学习者提升语言技能。然而，其中一个重要的挑战是在识别非母语/非流利语音时的高字错误率（WER），这会打断对话流程并令学习者感到失望。本文探讨了在对话环境中使用GPT4进行ASR错误纠正的方法。除了WER，我们还提出使用语义文本相似度（STS）和下一个回复的合理性（NRS）指标来评估错误纠正模型对对话质量的影响。我们发现，由GPT4纠正的转录导致更高的对话质量，尽管WER有所增加。GPT4还优于标准的错误纠正方法，而无需领域专属数据。",
