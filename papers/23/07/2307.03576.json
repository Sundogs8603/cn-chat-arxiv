    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究对上下文学习进行了实证分析，并表明在人工合成线性回归任务上训练的transformer可以在具备足够容量的情况下学习实现Ridge回归，这是贝叶斯最优预测器[Akyurek等，2023]，而具有线性自注意力且没有MLP层的一层transformer将学习实现一步梯度下降(GD) [von Oswald等，2022]。然而，这些观察的理论基础尚不清晰。我们在理论上研究了具有单层线性自注意力的transformer，在合成噪声线性回归数据上进行训练。首先，我们在数学上证明了当协变量从标准高斯分布中抽取时，最小化预训练损失的一层transformer将在最小二乘线性回归目标上实现单步GD。然后，我们发现改变协变量和权重的分布会影响transformer的表现，具有更大的方差在任务上更好。",
