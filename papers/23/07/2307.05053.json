    "abstract": "A fundamental question asked in modal logic is whether a given theory is consistent. But consistent with what? A typical way to address this question identifies a choice of background knowledge axioms (say, S4, D, etc.) and then shows the assumptions codified by the theory in question to be consistent with those background axioms. But determining the specific choice and division of background axioms is, at least sometimes, little more than tradition. This paper introduces **generic theories** for propositional modal logic to address consistency results in a more robust way. As building blocks for background knowledge, generic theories provide a standard for categorical determinations of consistency. We argue that the results and methods of this paper help to elucidate problems in epistemology and enjoy sufficient scope and power to have purchase on problems bearing on modalities in judgement, inference, and decision making.",

    "translated_abstract": "模态逻辑中一个基本问题是给定的理论是否一致。但一致于什么？解决这个问题的一种典型方法是确定一组背景知识公理（比如S4、D等），然后展示与该理论相一致的假设与这些背景公理相一致。但确定具体的背景公理的选择和划分，至少有时候，仅仅是传统的一种做法。本文引入了对命题模态逻辑的**通用理论**，以更加稳健的方式解决一致性结果问题。通用理论作为背景知识的构建模块，为一致性的范畴决策提供了一个标准。我们认为本文的结果和方法有助于阐明认识论中的问题，并且具有足够的范围和能力来解决与判断、推理和决策中模态相关的问题。",
