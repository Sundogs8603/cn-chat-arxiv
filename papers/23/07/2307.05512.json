    "abstract": "In the presence of interaction conflicts, user trust in automation plays an important role in accepting intelligent environments such as smart homes. In this paper, a factorial research design is employed to investigate and compare the single and joint effects of Level of Automation (LoA), Frequency of Automated responses (FoA), and Conflict Intensity (CI) on human trust and acceptance of automation in the context of smart homes. To study these effects, we conducted web-based experiments to gather data from 324 online participants who experienced the system through a 3D simulation of a smart home. The findings show that the level and frequency of automation had an impact on user trust in smart environments. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the users' acceptance of automated smart environments decreased in the presence of automation failures and interaction conflicts.",

    "translated_abstract": "在交互冲突存在的情况下，用户对自动化的信任对于接受智能环境（如智能家居）非常重要。本文采用一个因子研究设计，研究和比较自动化水平（LoA）、自动化响应频率（FoA）和冲突强度（CI）对人类在智能家居环境中对自动化的信任和接受度的单独和联合影响。为了研究这些影响，我们进行了基于网络的实验，从324名在线参与者中收集了数据，他们通过一个智能家居的3D模拟系统体验了该系统。研究发现，自动化水平和频率对用户在智能环境中的信任产生了影响。此外，结果还表明，在出现自动化故障和交互冲突时，用户对自动化智能环境的接受度会降低。",
    "tldr": "交互冲突、自动化水平和自动化频率对人类在智能家居环境中对自动化的信任和接受度产生影响，自动化水平和频率越高，用户对智能环境的信任度越高，但在出现自动化故障和交互冲突时，用户对自动化智能环境的接受度降低。"
