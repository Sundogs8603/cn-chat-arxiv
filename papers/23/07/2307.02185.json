    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）带来了变革性的好处，同时也带来了独特的挑战，包括知识产权（IP）和伦理关切。本文探讨了缓解这些风险的新思路，从LLMs和已建立的Web系统之间的相似性出发。我们确定了“引文” - 对来源或证据的承认或引用 - 在LLMs中的关键缺失组成部分。引入引文可以增强内容的透明性和可验证性，从而应对LLMs的知识产权和伦理问题。我们进一步提议，LLMs的全面引文机制应考虑非参数化和参数化内容。尽管实施这样的引文机制的复杂性及潜在缺陷，我们主张推动其发展。基于这一基础，我们概述了该领域中的几个研究问题，旨在引导未来的探索方向。",
