    "translated_abstract": "学习一般高维任务是非常困难的，因为它需要与维度成指数增长的训练数据数量。然而，深度卷积神经网络（CNN）在克服这一挑战方面显示出了卓越的成功。一种普遍的假设是可学习任务具有高度结构化，CNN利用这种结构建立了数据的低维表示。然而，我们对它们需要多少训练数据以及这个数字如何取决于数据结构知之甚少。本文回答了针对一个简单的分类任务的这个问题，该任务旨在捕捉真实数据的相关方面：随机层次模型。在这个模型中，$n_c$个类别中的每一个对应于$m$个同义组合的高层次特征，并且这些特征又通过一个重复$L$次的迭代过程由子特征组成。我们发现，需要深度CNN学习这个任务的训练数据数量$P^*$（i）随着$n_c m^L$的增长而渐进地增长，这只有...",
