    "translated_abstract": "最近，主观时间序列回归（STR）任务引起了越来越多的关注。然而，大多数现有方法忽略了STR数据中的标签分布偏差，导致了偏倚的模型。最新的研究表明，在年龄估计和深度估计等不平衡回归任务中，数据集的先验标签分布是均匀的。然而，我们观察到STR任务中训练集和测试集的标签分布很可能既不均匀也不相同。这一独特的特征需要新的方法来估计更合理的分布以训练公平的模型。在这项工作中，我们提出了适用于时间序列数据的Utopia标签分布逼近（ULDA）方法，使训练标签分布更接近真实世界但未知的（utopia）标签分布。这将增强模型的公平性。具体而言，ULDA首先将训练标签分布与高斯核进行卷积。卷积后，在每个时间步处，样本数量需要通过加权重新获得。",
