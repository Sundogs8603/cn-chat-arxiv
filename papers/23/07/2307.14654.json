    "translated_abstract": "热浪和森林火灾在全球范围内对社会和生态系统造成重大影响。准确的热极端信息对于支持可行的减灾和适应策略的制定至关重要。区域气候模型常用于更好地理解这些事件的动态。这些模型具有非常庞大的输入参数集，其中物理方案中的参数大大影响模型的性能。然而，对于热极端来说，区域模型的参数敏感性分析在很大程度上还未被探索。本研究侧重于澳大利亚东南部地区，这个地区是热极端的全球热点之一。在澳大利亚东南部，Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) 模型是广泛使用的区域模型，用于模拟该地区的极端天气事件。因此，在本研究中，我们重点关注WRF模型参数对表面气象变量（如温度、相对湿度和风速）的敏感性。",
