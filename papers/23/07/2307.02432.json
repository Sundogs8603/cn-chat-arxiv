    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于概率和数据驱动的闭合模型，用于Reynolds平均Navier-Stokes (RANS)模拟中考虑模型的不确定性。该闭合模型包括两部分。第一部分是参数化的，利用了基于神经网络的张量基函数，这些函数依赖于应变率和旋转张量的不变量。第二部分则是随机变量，用于考虑模型误差。我们提出了一种完全贝叶斯的公式，并结合了一种稀疏先验，以识别问题领域中参数化闭合模型不足的地方，进而需要对雷诺应力张量进行随机修正。训练使用间接稀疏数据，如平均速度和压力，而不需要直接的雷诺应力数据，与大多数其他方法不同。为了推断和学习，我们采用了一种基于蒙特卡洛估计的随机变分推断方案。",
