    "abstract": "A typical benchmark dataset for recommender system (RecSys) evaluation consists of user-item interactions generated on a platform within a time period. The interaction generation mechanism partially explains why a user interacts with (e.g.,like, purchase, rate) an item, and the context of when a particular interaction happened. In this study, we conduct a meticulous analysis on the MovieLens dataset and explain the potential impact on using the dataset for evaluating recommendation algorithms. We make a few main findings from our analysis. First, there are significant differences in user interactions at the different stages when a user interacts with the MovieLens platform. The early interactions largely define the user portrait which affect the subsequent interactions. Second, user interactions are highly affected by the candidate movies that are recommended by the platform's internal recommendation algorithm(s). Removal of interactions that happen nearer to the last few interactions ",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统评估的典型基准数据集是在某一时间段内在平台上生成的用户-物品交互数据。交互生成机制部分解释了为什么用户与物品进行交互（如喜欢、购买、评分）以及特定交互发生的背景。在本研究中，我们对MovieLens数据集进行了细致的分析，并解释了使用该数据集进行评估推荐算法时可能的影响。我们从分析中得出了一些主要发现。首先，在用户与MovieLens平台交互的不同阶段存在显著差异。早期交互在很大程度上定义了用户画像，影响了后续的交互。其次，用户交互受到平台内部推荐算法推荐的候选电影的很大影响。删除靠近最后几次交互的交互会对结果产生较大影响。",
