    "translated_abstract": "最近，权重共享技术显著加快了神经架构搜索的训练和评估过程。然而，大多数现有的权重共享策略仅基于经验或观察，导致搜索结果缺乏可解释性和合理性。此外，由于对公平性的忽视，当前方法在模块评估中容易做出错误判断。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种基于动态等色性的新型神经架构搜索算法。我们使用均场理论中的固定点分析方法来分析稳态随机神经网络的动力学行为，以及动态等色性如何保证基于权重共享的NAS的公平性。同时，我们通过估计所有模块的良好条件的Jacobian的泛化误差证明了我们的模块选择策略是严格公平的。大量实验表明，与相同大小的架构相比，我们提出的算法搜索到的架构具有更好的性能。",
