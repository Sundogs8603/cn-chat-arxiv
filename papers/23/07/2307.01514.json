    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning in federated learning paradigm has been gaining a lot of interest both in industry and research due to the collaborative learning capability on unlabeled yet isolated data. However, self-supervised based federated learning strategies suffer from performance degradation due to label scarcity and diverse data distributions, i.e., data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose the SelfFed framework for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Our proposed SelfFed framework works in two phases. The first phase is the pre-training paradigm that performs augmentive modeling using Swin Transformer based encoder in a decentralized manner. The first phase of SelfFed framework helps to overcome the data heterogeneity issue. The second phase is the fine-tuning paradigm that introduces contrastive network and a novel aggregation strategy that is trained on limited labeled data for a target task in a decentralized manner. This fine-tuning stage overcomes the label scarcity problem",

    "translated_abstract": "基于自监督学习的联邦学习范式在行业和研究领域中引起了很大的兴趣，因为它可以协作学习未标记但孤立的数据。然而，自监督的联邦学习策略在标签稀缺和数据异质性（即数据分布不同）方面存在性能下降的问题。在本文中，我们提出了适用于医疗物联网（IoMT）的SelfFed框架。我们的SelfFed框架分为两个阶段。第一个阶段是预训练范式，使用基于Swin Transformer的编码器以分散的方式进行增强建模。SelfFed框架的第一个阶段有助于克服数据异质性问题。第二个阶段是微调范式，引入对比网络和一种在有限标记数据上进行训练的新型聚合策略，用于目标任务的分散训练。这个微调阶段克服了标签稀缺问题。",
