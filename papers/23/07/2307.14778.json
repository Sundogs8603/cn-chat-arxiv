    "translated_abstract": "非侵入式负载监测 (NILM) 通过将整个房屋的总功耗信号分解来识别各种家用电器的状态和电能消耗。高效准确的负载监测有助于建立用户个人资料、智能家居能源管理和峰值负荷转移。这对于最终用户和公用事业都有益处，可以提高电力分配网络的整体效率。现有的方法主要集中在为每个电器开发单独的模型。这些方法通常依赖于大量难以收集的家庭标记数据。在本文中，我们提出了一种多设备任务框架，配合一个训练高效的样本增强 (SA) 方案，以有限的标记数据提高分解性能。对于每个电器，我们开发了一个共享的分层拆分结构，用于其回归和分类任务。此外，我们还提出了一个二维注意机制。",
