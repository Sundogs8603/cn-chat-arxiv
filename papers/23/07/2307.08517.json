    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习中，回归问题中的协变量偏移和训练数据与测试数据之间的分布不匹配是一种常见现象。在本文中，我们将最近关于独立同分布数据的非参数收敛速度结果扩展到马尔可夫依赖结构。我们证明，在对回归函数进行H\\\"older平滑性假设的情况下，Nadaraya-Watson核估计器的泛化风险的收敛速度由源和目标马尔可夫链的固有分布之间的相似性决定。这种相似性可以明确地用最近Pathak、Ma和Wainwright [ICML，2022]中引入的一个依赖于带宽的相似性度量来捕捉。对于有限马尔可夫链和谱间隙马尔可夫链的特殊情况，导出了精确的收敛速度，其中其固有分布之间的相似性度量随着带宽的减小而多项式增长。对于后者，我们扩展了...",

The authors demonstrate that the convergence rates of the generalization risk of a Nadaraya-Watson kernel estimator depend on the similarity between the invariant distributions of the source and target Markov chains, and propose a bandwidth-dependent similarity measure to capture this similarity. Exact convergence rates are derived for finite Markov chains and spectral gap Markov chains."
