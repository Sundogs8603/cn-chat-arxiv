    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文通过对比生物系统和算法系统，重点探讨“代理”概念，来探讨人工通用智能（AGI）的发展前景。作者指出了三个基本的差异：（1）生物系统具有自我制造的自主能力，能够设定自身的内在目标，而算法系统存在于一个由外部代理提供目标函数的计算环境中。（2）生物系统是具体体现的，即其符号和物理方面没有区分，而算法运行在计算结构上，最大限度地将软件与硬件隔离。（3）生物系统体验到一个庞大的世界，其中大多数问题是模糊的（并非全部可定义），而算法系统存在于一个小世界中，其中所有问题都是明确的。这三个差异说明了生物和算法系统具有非常不同的能力。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates the differences between living systems and algorithmic systems, highlighting the fact that living systems have the ability to self-manufacture, do not differentiate between symbolic and physical aspects, and experience a large world with ill-defined problems, while algorithmic systems do not possess these characteristics."
