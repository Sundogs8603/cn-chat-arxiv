    "translated_abstract": "游戏内容的平衡显著影响游戏体验。不平衡的游戏内容会降低参与度或增加重复失败的挫败感。虽然游戏设计师有意调整游戏内容的难度，但这是一个繁琐、劳动密集且具有挑战性的过程，特别是对于内容丰富的商业级游戏。为了解决这个问题，游戏研究界探索了使用人工智能（AI）技术进行自动游戏平衡的方法。然而，以往的研究主要集中在有限的游戏内容上，并没有考虑到游戏测试代理在遇到内容变化时的泛化能力的重要性。在本研究中，我们提出了RaidEnv，这是一个新的游戏模拟器，包括多样化且可定制的内容，适用于MMORPG游戏中的boss raid情景。此外，我们设计了两个boss raid情景的基准，可以辅助游戏人工智能的实际应用。这些基准解决了两个开放性问题。",
