In this work, we propose PLiNIO, an open-source library implementing a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art DNN design automation techniques, all based on lightweight gradient-based optimization, under a unified and user-friendly interface. With experiments on several edge-relevant tasks, we show that combining the various optimizations available in PLiNIO leads to rich sets of solutions that Pareto-dominate the considered baselines in terms of accuracy vs model size. Noteworthy, PLiNIO achieves up to 94.34% memory reduction for a <1% accuracy drop compared to a baseline architecture.",
