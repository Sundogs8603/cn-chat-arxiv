    "abstract": "Understanding the world in terms of objects and the possible interplays with them is an important cognition ability, especially in robotics manipulation, where many tasks require robot-object interactions. However, learning such a structured world model, which specifically captures entities and relationships, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. To address this, we propose FOCUS, a model-based agent that learns an object-centric world model. Thanks to a novel exploration bonus that stems from the object-centric representation, FOCUS can be deployed on robotics manipulation tasks to explore object interactions more easily. Evaluating our approach on manipulation tasks across different settings, we show that object-centric world models allow the agent to solve tasks more efficiently and enable consistent exploration of robot-object interactions. Using a Franka Emika robot arm, we also showcase how FOCUS could be adopted in real-world settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "在机器人操纵中，以物体为中心的世界模型是理解物体及其可能的相互作用的重要认知能力。然而，学习这样一个特定捕捉实体和关系的结构化世界模型仍然是一个具有挑战性且尚未深入探索的问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了FOCUS，这是一个基于模型的代理机器人，可以学习以物体为中心的世界模型。通过来自以物体为中心的表示的新颖探索奖励，FOCUS可以在机器人操纵任务中更轻松地探索物体间的相互作用。在不同环境中对我们的方法进行评估，我们展示了以物体为中心的世界模型可以使代理机器人更高效地解决任务，并实现对机器人-物体交互的一致性探索。通过使用Franka Emika机器人臂，我们还展示了FOCUS如何在实际环境中进行应用。",
