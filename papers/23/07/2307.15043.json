    "translated_abstract": "由于“开箱即用”的大型语言模型能够生成大量引起反感的内容，最新的研究专注于对齐这些模型，以防止产生不良生成。尽管在规避这些措施上取得了一些成功，所谓的对LLMs的“越狱”攻击，但这些攻击需要人为的巧思，实际上并不稳定。在本文中，我们提出了一种简单而有效的攻击方法，使对齐的语言模型生成不良行为。具体而言，我们的方法找到一个后缀，当附加到各种查询上，供LLM生成不良内容时，旨在最大化模型产生肯定回答（而不是拒绝回答）的概率。然而，与其依赖手工设计，我们的方法通过贪婪和基于梯度的搜索技术自动产生这些对抗性后缀，并且在过去的自动化方法上进行了改进。",
