    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在许多科学领域都产生了巨大影响，近年来，在低温等离子体建模和模拟领域也引起了极大的关注。尽管它的应用应该被谨慎评估，但机器学习和数据驱动建模的最新进展在等离子体建模和模拟的许多方面都受益匪浅。在这项综述中，我们主要追求两个目标：(a)我们主要关注低温等离子体建模和模拟的方法的现状进行综述。通过将我们的综述划分为等离子体物理学、等离子体化学、等离子体表面相互作用和等离子体过程控制四个方面，我们旨在广泛讨论文献中的相关实例。(b)我们提供了对等离子体科学和技术潜在进展的展望。我们特别阐述了可能通过从其他科学学科中的适应推动的进展。我们认为，已知的未解决问题和新的研究领域将使低温等离子体建模和模拟取得重大进展。",
