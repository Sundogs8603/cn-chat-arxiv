    "translated_abstract": "神经网络机器学习的兴起引发了高级库的出现，包括TensorFlow和PyTorch，以支持它们的功能。计算流体动力学（CFD）研究人员受益于这一趋势，产生了可以缩短模拟时间的强大神经网络。例如，多层感知机（MLPs）和长短期记忆（LSTM）循环神经网络（RNN）体系结构可以表示诸如湍流等子网格物理效应。在CFD求解器中实现神经网络是具有挑战性的，因为用于机器学习和CFD的编程语言大多不重叠。我们介绍了roseNNa库，它弥合了神经网络推断和CFD之间的差距。RoseNNa是一种非侵入性、轻量级（1000行代码）且高效的神经网络推断工具，重点关注于增强PDE求解器（如CFD）中使用的较小网络，这些求解器通常是用C/C++或Fortran编写的。RoseNNa通过自动地进行模型转换和集成来实现这一目标，无需修改现有求解器代码即可将神经网络应用于CFD问题。",
