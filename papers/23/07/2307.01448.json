    "abstract": "Structured chemical reaction information plays a vital role for chemists engaged in laboratory work and advanced endeavors such as computer-aided drug design. Despite the importance of extracting structured reactions from scientific literature, data annotation for this purpose is cost-prohibitive due to the significant labor required from domain experts. Consequently, the scarcity of sufficient training data poses an obstacle to the progress of related models in this domain. In this paper, we propose ReactIE, which combines two weakly supervised approaches for pre-training. Our method utilizes frequent patterns within the text as linguistic cues to identify specific characteristics of chemical reactions. Additionally, we adopt synthetic data from patent records as distant supervision to incorporate domain knowledge into the model.

    "translated_abstract": "结构化化学反应信息对从事化学实验和计算辅助药物设计等领域的化学家来说至关重要。尽管从科学文献中提取结构化反应的重要性，但由于领域专家需要大量的工作，导致为此目的进行数据标注成本过高。因此，缺乏足够的训练数据成为该领域相关模型进展的障碍。本文提出了ReactIE，它结合两种弱监督方法进行预训练。我们的方法利用文本中的频繁模式作为语言线索来识别化学反应的特定特征。此外，我们采用专利记录中的合成数据作为远程监督，将领域知识纳入模型中。实验证明，ReactIE取得了显著的改进，并优于所有现有的基线方法。",
