    "abstract": "Layer compositing is one of the most popular image editing workflows among both amateurs and professionals. Motivated by the success of diffusion models, we explore layer compositing from a layered image generation perspective. Instead of generating an image, we propose to generate background, foreground, layer mask, and the composed image simultaneously. To achieve layered image generation, we train an autoencoder that is able to reconstruct layered images and train diffusion models on the latent representation. One benefit of the proposed problem is to enable better compositing workflows in addition to the high-quality image output. Another benefit is producing higher-quality layer masks compared to masks produced by a separate step of image segmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to generate high-quality layered images and initiates a benchmark for future work.",

    "translated_abstract": "图层合成是业余爱好者和专业人士中最受欢迎的图像编辑工作流之一。受到扩散模型的成功启发，我们从分层图像生成的角度探索图层合成问题。我们提出了一种同时生成背景、前景、图层遮罩和合成图像的方法，而不仅仅是生成一幅图像。为了实现分层图像生成，我们训练了一个自动编码器来重建分层图像，并在潜在表示上训练了扩散模型。该方法的一个好处是在高质量图像输出之外，可以实现更好的合成工作流程。另一个好处是生成比通过图像分割的独立步骤产生的图层遮罩更高质量的图层遮罩。实验结果表明，所提出的方法能够生成高质量的分层图像，并为未来的工作奠定了基准。",
