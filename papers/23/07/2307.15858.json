The taxonomy of e-commerce catalogs consists of thousands of genres to which are assigned items that are uploaded by merchants on a continuous basis. The genre assignments by merchants are often wrong but treated as ground truth labels in automatically generated training sets, thus creating a feedback loop that leads to poorer model quality over time. This problem of taxonomy classification becomes highly pronounced due to the unavailability of sizable curated training sets.  Under such a scenario it is common to combine multiple classifiers to combat poor generalization performance from a single classifier. We propose an extensible deep learning based classification model framework that benefits from the simplicity and robustness of averaging ensembles and fusion based classifiers.

    "translated_abstract": "本论文研究了大规模电子商务目录中产品项目分类的问题。电子商务目录的分类包含了数千种流派，商家可以随时上传商品进行分类。然而，商家的分类结果往往是错误的，但却被当作自动生成训练集时的标签，从而形成了一个反馈循环，导致模型质量越来越差。由于缺乏规模可观的筛选训练集，分类问题变得尤为显著。在这种情况下，通常使用多个分类器的组合来对抗单一分类器的泛化性能较差的问题。我们提出了一个基于深度学习的可扩展分类模型框架，可以受益于平均集成和融合分类器的简单性和稳健性。我们还能够利用元数据特征和低层特征工程来提升分类质量。",
