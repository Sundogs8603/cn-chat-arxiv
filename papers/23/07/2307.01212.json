    "translated_abstract": "截断奇异值分解是音乐推荐中广泛使用的方法，用于直接检索类似物品或为下游任务嵌入音乐项目。本文研究了在许多推荐数据集中自然发生的一种有趣效应：嵌入空间中的尖峰形成。我们首先提出了一种衡量这种尖峰组织强度的度量标准，然后在数学上证明其起源与内部流行度各异的项目社区有关。凭借这种新获得的理论理解，我们最后以一种工业用例开放了该主题，用于估计在添加数据的情况下音乐嵌入的前k个相似项目将如何随时间变化。",

By proposing a metric and proving its connection to communities of items with varying internal popularity, the paper sheds light on this interesting phenomenon. Additionally, the paper explores how the top-k similar items in music embeddings change over time with the addition of data, using an industrial use case."
