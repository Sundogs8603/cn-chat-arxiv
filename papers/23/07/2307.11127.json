    "translated_abstract": "合成对照方法（SCMs）已成为比较案例研究中因果推断的重要工具。SCMs的基本思想是通过使用来自未处理单元的观测结果的加权和来估计经过处理单元的反事实结果。合成对照（SC）的准确性对于估计因果效应至关重要，因此，SC权重的估计成为了研究的焦点。在本文中，我们首先指出现有的SCMs存在一个隐式内生性问题，即未处理单元的结果与反事实结果模型中的误差项之间的相关性。我们展示了这个问题会对因果效应估计器产生偏差。然后，我们提出了一种基于密度匹配的新型SCM，假设经过处理单元的结果密度可以用未处理单元的密度的加权平均来近似（即混合模型）。基于这一假设，我们通过匹配来估计SC权重。",
