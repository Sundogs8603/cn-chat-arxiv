    "abstract": "Modern computer systems are ubiquitous in contemporary life yet many of them remain opaque. This poses significant challenges in domains where desiderata such as fairness or accountability are crucial. We suggest that the best strategy for achieving system transparency varies depending on the specific source of opacity prevalent in a given context. Synthesizing and extending existing discussions, we propose a taxonomy consisting of eight sources of opacity that fall into three main categories: architectural, analytical, and socio-technical. For each source, we provide initial suggestions as to how to address the resulting opacity in practice. The taxonomy provides a starting point for requirements engineers and other practitioners to understand contextually prevalent sources of opacity, and to select or develop appropriate strategies for overcoming them.",

    "translated_abstract": "现代计算机系统无处不在，但其中许多系统仍然不透明。这在以公平或问责为关键因素的领域中带来了重大挑战。我们认为实现系统透明度的最佳策略因特定不透明源在给定语境中的普遍性而有所不同。综合和扩展现有讨论，我们提出了一个包含三个主要类别（体系结构、分析和社会技术）的八个不透明性来源的分类方法论。对于每个来源，我们提供了如何实际解决由此产生的不透明性的初步建议。该分类方法论为需求工程师和其他从业人员提供了了解语境中普遍的不透明性来源，并选择或开发适当策略来克服这些问题的起点。",
