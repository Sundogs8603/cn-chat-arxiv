In this paper, we report on some observations that we made during studying non-linear similarity measures for computing trace links.

    "translated_abstract": "软件开发生命周期中的构件之间存在追踪链接可以提高软件开发、维护和运营过程中的效率。然而，追踪链接的创建和维护耗时且容易出错。近年来，随着自然语言处理领域强大工具的出现，对自动计算追踪链接进行研究的努力逐渐增加。在本文中，我们报告了在研究用于计算追踪链接的非线性相似度度量时所做的一些观察。我们认为，从几何视角来看待语义相似性可以有助于未来的追踪性研究。我们在四个开源项目和两个工业项目的数据集上评估了我们的观察结果。我们还指出，我们的发现更具普遍性，也可以为其他信息检索问题奠定基础。",
