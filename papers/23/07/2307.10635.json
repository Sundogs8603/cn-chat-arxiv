    "translated_abstract": "最近大型语言模型(LLMs)的进展在许多数学基准上取得了显著的进步。然而，这些基准大多只包含初高中科目的问题，仅包含多项选择题，并且仅限于基本算术运算范围。为了解决这些问题，本文介绍了一个广泛的基准套件SciBench，旨在系统地检测复杂科学问题解决所需的推理能力。SciBench包含两个经过精心策划的数据集：一个开放集，包括从数学、化学和物理教科书中摘录的大学水平的科学问题，以及一个封闭集，包含来自计算机科学和数学本科考试的问题。基于这两个数据集，我们对两个代表性的LLM进行了深入的基准研究，并采用不同的提示策略。结果表明，当前的LLMs在提供复杂科学问题解决能力方面还存在不足之处。",
