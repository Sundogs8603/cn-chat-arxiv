    "translated_abstract": "有损压缩已成为许多领域中减小数据大小的重要技术。这种压缩方法对于大小在几个PB范围内的大规模科学数据尤为重要。虽然基于自编码器的模型已成功地用于压缩图像和视频，但这种神经网络在科学数据领域尚未广为关注。我们的工作提出了一个神经网络，不仅可以显著压缩大规模科学数据，还可以保持高重建质量。所提出的模型在公开的科学基准数据上进行了测试，并应用于一种大规模高分辨率的气候模拟数据集。我们的模型在几个基准数据集上实现了140的压缩比，同时保持重建质量。高分辨率社区地球系统模型(CESM) Version 1.3的模拟数据在压缩比达到200的同时进行了压缩。",
