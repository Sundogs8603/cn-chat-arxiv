Firstly, we developed a GAN-based generative model to transform MR images into CT images, which was used to establish the anatomical correspondence between the two modalities. Next, we obtained numerous patches of subchondral bone regions of MR images, together with their trabecular parameters (BV / TV, Tb. Th, Tb. Sp, Tb.

Th，Tb. Sp，Tb. N）。蒸馏学习技术用于训练回归模型并传输MR结构。",
