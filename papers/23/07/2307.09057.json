    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个在低维空间中计算两组点之间Gromov-Wasserstein问题的框架，其中差异是欧几里得范数的平方。Gromov-Wasserstein问题是优化运输问题的一种推广，它寻找保持尽可能多的成对距离的两组点之间的对应关系。这可以用于量化AI和机器学习中两个形态或形状的相似性，这是一个常见的问题。问题可以被建模为一个Quadratic Assignment Problem（QAP），即使对于小问题来说，QAP在一般情况下也是难以计算的。我们的框架通过将QAP重新表述为一个在低维域上的优化问题来应对这个挑战，利用了问题可以表示为低秩的凹二次优化问题的事实。这种方法在点的数量方面具有良好的可扩展性，并且可以用于在成千上万的大规模问题中找到全局解决方案。",
