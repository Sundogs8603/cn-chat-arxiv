    "translated_abstract": "当前离线强化学习（RL）研究中对基准的普遍使用导致了对实际数据集分布不平衡的忽视。由于探索或安全考虑的挑战，实际离线RL数据集在状态空间上通常是不平衡的。我们在本文中具体说明了离线RL中不平衡数据集的特性，其中状态覆盖率遵循一个由偏态策略所特征化的幂律分布。理论上和实证上，我们证明了基于分布约束的典型离线RL方法，如保守Q学习（CQL），在不平衡数据集下提取策略是无效的。受自然智能的启发，我们提出了一种新的离线RL方法，该方法利用CQL的增强与回溯过程相结合，以回忆以往相关经验，有效地缓解不平衡数据集带来的挑战。我们在多个任务上评估了我们的方法。",
