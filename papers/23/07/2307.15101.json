    "abstract": "The safety of children in children home has become an increasing social concern, and the purpose of this experiment is to use machine learning applied to detect the scenarios of child abuse to increase the safety of children. This experiment uses machine learning to classify and recognize a child's voice and predict whether the current sound made by the child is crying, screaming or laughing. If a child is found to be crying or screaming, an alert is immediately sent to the relevant personnel so that they can perceive what the child may be experiencing in a surveillance blind spot and respond in a timely manner. Together with a hybrid use of video image classification, the accuracy of child abuse detection can be significantly increased. This greatly reduces the likelihood that a child will receive violent abuse in the nursery and allows personnel to stop an imminent or incipient child abuse incident in time. The datasets collected from this experiment is entirely from sounds recorded ",

    "translated_abstract": "儿童福利院中儿童的安全已成为一个日益关注的社会问题，本实验旨在利用机器学习应用于儿童虐待的场景检测，以提高儿童的安全性。该实验使用机器学习对儿童的声音进行分类和识别，预测儿童当前发出的声音是哭泣、尖叫还是笑声。如果发现儿童正在哭泣或尖叫，立即向相关人员发送警报，以便他们能够察觉到儿童在监控盲区中可能经历的情况，并及时作出反应。结合视频图像分类的混合使用，可以显著提高儿童虐待检测的准确性。这极大地降低了婴儿室中儿童遭受暴力虐待的可能性，并使工作人员能够及时阻止即将发生或初期的儿童虐待事件。本实验收集的数据集完全来自录音中的声音记录。",
