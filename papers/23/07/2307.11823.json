    "translated_abstract": "卷积神经网络（CNN）在数据分布转变下表现出差劲的泛化性能。已经对它们的泛化性能进行了广泛的研究，而其中一种方法是从频率角度考虑问题。这些研究指出，人类和CNN可能会关注图像的不同频率成分。首先，受到这些观察的启发，我们提出了一种简单而有效的数据增强方法HybridAugment，它减少了CNN对高频成分的依赖，从而提高了它们在保持准确度的同时的鲁棒性。其次，我们提出了HierarchicalAugment++，这是一种层次化的增强方法，旨在统一各种频谱增强方法。HierarchicalAugment++基于HybridAugment，减少了CNN对图像振幅分量的依赖，并推动相位信息的应用。这种统一结果句对抗现有技术的竞争性结果。",
