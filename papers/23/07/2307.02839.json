    "abstract": "News summary generation is an important task in the field of intelligence analysis, which can provide accurate and comprehensive information to help people better understand and respond to complex real-world events. However, traditional news summary generation methods face some challenges, which are limited by the model itself and the amount of training data, as well as the influence of text noise, making it difficult to generate reliable information accurately. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for news summary generation using LLM with powerful natural language understanding and generative capabilities. We use LLM to extract multiple structured event patterns from the events contained in news paragraphs, evolve the event pattern population with genetic algorithm, and select the most adaptive event pattern to input into the LLM to generate news summaries. A News Summary Generator (NSG) is designed to select and evolve the event pattern populations and generate news summaries. T",

    "translated_abstract": "新闻摘要生成是情报分析领域中的重要任务，可以提供准确全面的信息，帮助人们更好地理解和应对复杂的现实事件。然而，传统的新闻摘要生成方法面临一些挑战，包括模型本身和训练数据量的限制，以及文本噪声的影响，使得准确生成可靠信息变得困难。本文提出了一种使用具有强大自然语言理解和生成能力的LLM进行新闻摘要生成的新范式。我们利用LLM从新闻段落中提取多个结构化事件模式，通过遗传算法进化事件模式群体，并选择最适应的事件模式输入LLM生成新闻摘要。设计了一个新闻摘要生成器(NSG)来选择和进化事件模式群体，并生成新闻摘要。",
