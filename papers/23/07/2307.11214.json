    "translated_abstract": "生成跨区域的真实人流对我们理解城市结构和人口活动模式至关重要，可以在城市规划和管理领域中应用。然而，现有大多数流动生成方法的一个明显缺点是忽视了预测公平性，这可能导致高危人群地区移动流量的低估，可能导致不公平的资源分配和基础设施发展。为了克服这个局限性，我们的研究提出了一种新颖的、注重公平性的深度学习模型FairMobi-Net，用于跨区域人流预测。FairMobi-Net模型将公平性损失独特地纳入损失函数，并采用二进制分类和数值回归技术的混合方法用于人流预测。我们使用四个美国城市的全面人流数据集验证了FairMobi-Net模型，并预测人类流动。",
