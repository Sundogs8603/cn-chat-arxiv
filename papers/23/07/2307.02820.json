    "translated_abstract": "语音情感识别是语音处理领域中的一个具有挑战性的任务。为了展示和处理语音信号，特征提取过程具有重要意义。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个模型，将原始音频文件直接输入深度神经网络进行情感识别，而无需进行任何特征提取阶段，利用了六个不同的数据集：EMO-DB、RAVDESS、TESS、CREMA、SAVEE和TESS+RAVDESS。为了展示所提出模型的贡献，我们将传统的特征提取技术（如梅尔频谱图、梅尔频率倒谱系数）与机器学习算法、集成学习方法、深度学习和混合深度学习技术相结合。我们评估了支持向量机、决策树、朴素贝叶斯、随机森林模型作为机器学习算法，以及多数投票和堆叠方法作为集成学习技术。此外，我们还评估了卷积神经网络、遗传算法和深度卷积神经网络作为深度学习技术。",
