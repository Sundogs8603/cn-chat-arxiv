    "translated_abstract": "点云深度模型在安全关键任务中的使用越来越普遍，但是点云噪声可能会影响这些模型的可靠性和安全性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的点云异常值去除方法(PointCVaR)，它可以使标准训练的模型消除额外的异常值并恢复数据。我们的方法首先进行归因分析，以确定每个点对模型输出的影响，我们将其称为点的风险。然后，我们使用条件风险价值 (CVaR) 作为目标，优化高风险点的过滤过程。这种方法的基本原理是观察到点云噪声点往往聚集在风险分布的尾部，频率低但风险水平高，从而对分类结果产生重大干扰。尽管不需要额外的训练，我们的方法却能产生出色的结果。",
