Building upon the unrolling methodology, we introduce novel task-based deep learning frameworks, denoted as Deep RLS and Deep EASI. These architectures transform the iterations of the original algorithms into layers of a deep neural network, thereby enabling efficient source signal estimation by taking advantage of a training process.

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过算法展开的视角重新审视了两种著名的自适应滤波算法，即递归最小二乘法（RLS）和等变自适应源分离（EASI），在源估计和分离的环境中。在展开方法的基础上，我们引入了新的基于任务的深度学习框架，称为Deep RLS和Deep EASI。这些架构将原始算法的迭代变换为深度神经网络的层，从而通过利用训练过程有效地进行源信号估计。为了进一步提高性能，我们提出使用基于Stein无偏风险估计（SURE）的损失函数对这些深度展开网络进行训练。我们的实证评估证明了这种基于SURE的方法对于增强源信号估计的有效性。",
