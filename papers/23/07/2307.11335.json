    "translated_abstract": "尽管神经辐射场（NeRF）取得了巨大的进展，但我们仍然面临质量和效率之间的抉择，例如，MipNeRF能够呈现精细详细和抗锯齿的渲染效果，但需要数天的训练时间，而Instant-ngp可以在几分钟内完成重建，但在渲染不同距离或分辨率时会出现模糊或锯齿化的问题，因为忽略了采样区域。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的三向 Mip 编码，实现了神经辐射场的即时重建和抗锯齿高保真渲染。关键在于将预滤波的三维特征空间分解为三个正交的 mipmaps。通过利用二维预滤波特征图，我们可以高效地进行三维区域采样，从而显著提高渲染质量而不损失效率。为应对新的三向 Mip 表示方法，我们提出了一种锥投射渲染技术，以高效采样抗锯齿的三维特征。",
