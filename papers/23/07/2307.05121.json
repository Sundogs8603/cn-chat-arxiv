    "translated_abstract": "如何获取交易的信息表示并进行欺诈交易的识别是确保金融安全的关键部分。最近的研究将图神经网络应用于交易欺诈检测问题。然而，由于结构限制，它们在有效学习空间-时间信息方面遇到了挑战。此外，很少有基于图神经网络的先前检测器意识到合并全局信息的重要性，该全局信息涵盖了相似的行为模式并为判别性表示学习提供了有价值的见解。因此，我们提出了一种新颖的异构图神经网络，称为空间-时间感知图转换器（STA-GT），用于交易欺诈检测问题。具体来说，我们设计了一种时间编码策略来捕捉时间依赖关系，并将其纳入图神经网络框架中，增强了空间-时间信息建模并改进了表达能力。",
