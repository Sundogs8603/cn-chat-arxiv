    "abstract": "Despite the rich literature on machine learning fairness, relatively little attention has been paid to remediating complex systems, where the final prediction is the combination of multiple classifiers and where multiple groups are present. In this paper, we first show that natural baseline approaches for improving equal opportunity fairness scale linearly with the product of the number of remediated groups and the number of remediated prediction labels, rendering them impractical. We then introduce two simple techniques, called {\\em task-overconditioning} and {\\em group-interleaving}, to achieve a constant scaling in this multi-group multi-label setup. Our experimental results in academic and real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal at mitigation within this environment.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管机器学习公平性方面的研究文献丰富，但对于修复复杂系统（其中最终预测是多个分类器的组合，存在多个组）的关注相对较少。本文首先展示了用于改善机会平等公平性的自然基线方法与被修复组数和被修复预测标签数的乘积呈线性关系，使其不实用。然后，我们引入了两种简单的技术，称为“任务过条件化”和“组间交替”，以在多组多标签设定中实现恒定比例缩放。我们在学术和实际环境中的实验结果证明了我们的方案在这个环境中的有效性。",
