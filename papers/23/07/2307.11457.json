    "abstract": "Although machine translation systems are mostly designed to serve in the general domain, there is a growing tendency to adapt these systems to other domains like literary translation. In this paper, we focus on English-Turkish literary translation and develop machine translation models that take into account the stylistic features of translators. We fine-tune a pre-trained machine translation model by the manually-aligned works of a particular translator. We make a detailed analysis of the effects of manual and automatic alignments, data augmentation methods, and corpus size on the translations. We propose an approach based on stylistic features to evaluate the style of a translator in the output translations. We show that the human translator style can be highly recreated in the target machine translations by adapting the models to the style of the translator.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管机器翻译系统主要设计用于一般领域，但存在将这些系统适应其他领域（如文学翻译）的趋势。本文着重研究英土文学翻译，并开发考虑翻译家风格特征的机器翻译模型。我们通过人工对齐的特定译者作品来微调预训练的机器翻译模型。我们对手动对齐、自动对齐、数据增强方法和语料库大小对翻译效果进行了详细分析。我们提出了一种基于风格特征的方法来评估译者在输出翻译中的风格。我们展示了通过将模型适应到译者的风格，可以高度重现人类译者的风格在目标机器翻译中的效果。",
