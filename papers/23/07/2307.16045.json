    "abstract": "This paper presents the methodology and data used for the automatic extraction of the Romanian Academic Word List (Ro-AWL). Academic Word Lists are useful in both L2 and L1 teaching contexts. For the Romanian language, no such resource exists so far. Ro-AWL has been generated by combining methods from corpus and computational linguistics with L2 academic writing approaches. We use two types of data: (a) existing data, such as the Romanian Frequency List based on the ROMBAC corpus, and (b) self-compiled data, such as the expert academic writing corpus EXPRES. For constructing the academic word list, we follow the methodology for building the Academic Vocabulary List for the English language. The distribution of Ro-AWL features (general distribution, POS distribution) into four disciplinary datasets is in line with previous research. Ro-AWL is freely available and can be used for teaching, research and NLP applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了罗马尼亚学术词汇表（Ro-AWL）自动提取的方法和数据。学术词汇表在L2和L1教学环境中都非常有用，但对于罗马尼亚语来说，迄今为止还没有这样的资源。Ro-AWL是通过将语料库和计算语言学方法与L2学术写作方法相结合生成的。我们使用了两种类型的数据：（a）现有数据，例如基于ROMBAC语料库的罗马尼亚频率列表，和（b）自编数据，例如专家学术写作语料库EXPRES。为了构建学术词汇表，我们遵循了为英语语言建立学术词汇表的方法。Ro-AWL的特征分布（总体分布，词性分布）与先前的研究一致，将其分为四个学科数据集。Ro-AWL可供教学、研究和自然语言处理应用免费使用。",
