    "abstract": "The increasing applications of AI systems require personalized explanations for their behaviors to various stakeholders since the stakeholders may have various knowledge and backgrounds. In general, a conversation between explainers and explainees not only allows explainers to obtain the explainees' background, but also allows explainees to better understand the explanations. In this paper, we propose an approach for an explainer to communicate personalized explanations to an explainee through having consecutive conversations with the explainee. We prove that the conversation terminates due to the explainee's justification of the initial claim as long as there exists an explanation for the initial claim that the explainee understands and the explainer is aware of.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于利益相关者可能具有各种知识和背景，人工智能系统的应用越来越需要对其行为进行个性化解释。一般来说，解释者和被解释者之间的对话不仅能帮助解释者了解被解释者的背景，还能让被解释者更好地理解解释。在本文中，我们提出了一种通过与被解释者进行连续对话来向其传达个性化解释的方法。我们证明了只要存在一个被解释者理解并且解释者知晓的对于初始主张的解释，那么对话将因为被解释者对初始主张的证明而终止。",
