    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore the economic, institutional, and political/governmental factors in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows in the emerging twenty-four Asian economies. To examine the significant determinants of FDI, the study uses panel data for a period of seventeen years (2002-2018). The panel methodology enables us to deal with endogeneity and other issues. Multiple regression models are done for empirical evidence. The study focuses on a holistic approach and considers different variables under three broad areas: economic, institutional, and political aspects. The variables include Market Size, Trade Openness, Inflation, Natural Resource, Lending Rate, Capital Formation as economic factors and Business Regulatory Environment and Business Disclosure Index as institutional factors and Political Stability, Government Effectiveness, and Rule of Law as political factors. The empirical findings show most of the economic factors significantly affect FDI inflows wherea",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了在新兴的二十四个亚洲经济体中，吸引外国直接投资（FDI）流入的经济、制度和政治/政府因素。为了研究FDI的显著影响因素，该研究使用了为期17年（2002-2018年）的面板数据。面板方法使我们能够处理内生性和其他问题。实证研究采用多元回归模型进行。研究着重于整体性的方法，并考虑了经济、制度和政治等三个广泛领域下的不同变量。变量包括市场规模、贸易开放程度、通货膨胀、自然资源、贷款利率、资本形成作为经济因素，以及商业管制环境和商业披露指数作为制度因素，以及政治稳定性、政府效能和法治作为政治因素。实证研究结果显示，大多数经济因素显著影响FDI流入，而制度因素和政治因素的影响较小。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study examines the impact of economic, institutional, and political/governmental factors on attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows in emerging Asian economies through panel data analysis. The results show that economic factors have a significant influence on FDI inflows, while the impacts of institutional and political factors are relatively smaller."
