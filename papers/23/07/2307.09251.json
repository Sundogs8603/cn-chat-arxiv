    "translated_abstract": "尽管卢森堡是欧盟中人均GDP最高的国家之一，但由于城市快速发展，卢森堡面临着社会经济挑战。本文通过研究卢森堡市最微观且少有被分析的地理层面——社区，对这一现象进行了探讨。基于2020-2021年收集的涵盖各种社会人口特征的实证数据，运用主成分的升序分层聚类方法，确定了社区的社会空间模式。此外，还进行了Chi2检验，以研究居民的社会人口特征和社区的收入不平等程度。结果显示，沿着西北-东南轴线存在明显的社会空间分割。而且，相对于性别或国籍差异，社会组成比例更能决定收入不平等。",

The findings show a clear divide along a north-west south-east axis, and highlight the proportion of social composition as a key determinant of income inequalities, surpassing factors such as gender or citizenship differences."
