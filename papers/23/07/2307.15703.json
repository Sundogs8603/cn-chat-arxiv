    "abstract": "Recent advances of powerful Language Models have allowed Natural Language Generation (NLG) to emerge as an important technology that can not only perform traditional tasks like summarisation or translation, but also serve as a natural language interface to a variety of applications. As such, it is crucial that NLG systems are trustworthy and reliable, for example by indicating when they are likely to be wrong; and supporting multiple views, backgrounds and writing styles -- reflecting diverse human sub-populations. In this paper, we argue that a principled treatment of uncertainty can assist in creating systems and evaluation protocols better aligned with these goals. We first present the fundamental theory, frameworks and vocabulary required to represent uncertainty. We then characterise the main sources of uncertainty in NLG from a linguistic perspective, and propose a two-dimensional taxonomy that is more informative and faithful than the popular aleatoric/epistemic dichotomy.

    "translated_abstract": "最近强大的语言模型的进展使得自然语言生成（NLG）作为一种重要技术崭露头角，它不仅可以执行传统任务如摘要或翻译，也可以作为一种自然语言接口应用于各种应用程序。因此，NLG系统的可靠性和可信度至关重要，例如在可能出错时指示，并支持多种观点、背景和写作风格 - 反映多元化人类亚群体。本文认为，对不确定性的原则性处理能够帮助创建与这些目标更好地对齐的系统和评估协议。我们首先介绍表示不确定性所需的基本理论、框架和词汇。然后从语言学的角度描述NLG中的主要不确定性源，并提出一个比流行的随机性/认识性二分法更详细和真实的二维分类法。",
