The main contribution consists in the adaption of known DL and KDL algorithms in the form of unsupervised methods, used for outlier detection. We propose a reduced kernel version (RKDL), which is useful for problems with large data sets, due to the large kernel matrix. We also improve the DL and RKDL methods by the use of a random selection of signals, which aims to eliminate the outliers from the training procedure. All our algorithms are introduced in an anomaly detection toolbox and are compared to standard benchmark results.",
