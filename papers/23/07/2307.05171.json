    "abstract": "The think aloud method is an important and commonly used tool for usability optimization. However, analyzing think aloud data could be time consuming. In this paper, we put forth an automatic analysis of verbal protocols and test the link between spoken feedback and the stimulus using eye tracking and mouse tracking. The gained data - user feedback linked to a specific area of the stimulus - could be used to let an expert review the feedback on specific web page elements or to visualize on which parts of the web page the feedback was given. Specifically, we test if participants fixate on or point with the mouse to the content of the webpage that they are verbalizing. During the testing, participants were shown three websites and asked to verbally give their opinion. The verbal responses, along with the eye and cursor movements were recorded. We compared the hit rate, defined as the percentage of verbally mentioned areas of interest (AOIs) that were fixated with gaze or pointed to with ",

    "translated_abstract": "口头思考方法是一种重要且常用的可用性优化工具。然而，分析口头数据可能耗费时间。在本文中，我们提出了一种自动分析口头协议并测试了利用眼动和鼠标追踪链接口头反馈和刺激之间的方法。获得的数据 - 用户反馈与刺激的特定区域相关联 - 可以用于让专家审核特定网页元素的反馈或者可视化反馈给出的网页部分。具体而言，我们测试参与者是否会注视或指向他们口头表达的网页内容。在测试过程中，参与者被要求口头表达对三个网站的意见。口头回应以及眼动和鼠标移动均被记录下来。我们比较了命中率，即以视线注视或鼠标指向的口头提到的感兴趣区域（AOIs）的百分比。",
