    "abstract": "This paper investigates the emotional reasoning abilities of the GPT family of large language models via a component perspective. The paper first examines how the model reasons about autobiographical memories. Second, it systematically varies aspects of situations to impact emotion intensity and coping tendencies. Even without the use of prompt engineering, it is shown that GPT's predictions align significantly with human-provided appraisals and emotional labels. However, GPT faces difficulties predicting emotion intensity and coping responses. GPT-4 showed the highest performance in the initial study but fell short in the second, despite providing superior results after minor prompt engineering. This assessment brings up questions on how to effectively employ the strong points and address the weak areas of these models, particularly concerning response variability. These studies underscore the merits of evaluating models from a componential perspective.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过组件的视角研究了GPT系列大型语言模型的情感推理能力。首先，本文考察了该模型对自传式记忆的推理方式。其次，通过系统性地改变情境的各个方面来影响情感强度和应对倾向。研究结果表明，即使在没有使用提示工程的情况下，GPT的预测结果与人类提供的评估和情感标签显著一致。然而，GPT在预测情感强度和应对反应方面遇到了困难。尽管GPT-4在初步研究中表现最好，但在第二项研究中表现不佳，尽管经过轻微的提示工程后提供了更好的结果。这个评估引发了如何有效地利用这些模型的优点并解决其弱点的问题，尤其是关于响应的变异性。这些研究突显了从组件的角度评估模型的优点。",
