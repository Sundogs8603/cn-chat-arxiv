Recent work has shown that low dimensional embeddings of these clinical data learned by variational autoencoders (VAE) can be used for genome-wide association studies and polygenic risk prediction. In this work, we consider multiple unsupervised learning methods for learning disentangled representations, namely autoencoders, VAE, beta-VAE, and FactorVAE, in the context of genetic association studies. Using spirograms from UK Biobank as a running example, we observed improvements in the number of genome-wide significant loci, heritability, and performance of polygenic risk scores for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by using FactorVAE or beta-VAE, compared to standard VAE or non-variational autoencoders. FactorVAEs performed effectively across m",

    "translated_abstract": "高维临床数据由于其在生物库规模数据集中的可访问性和高性能建模技术（尤其是深度学习）的发展，已经成为遗传研究中宝贵的资源。最近的研究表明，由变分自动编码器（VAE）学习的这些临床数据的低维嵌入可以用于全基因组关联研究和多基因风险预测。在这项工作中，我们考虑了多种无监督学习方法，用于在遗传相关研究中学习分离表示，包括自动编码器（autoencoders）、VAE、beta-VAE和FactorVAE。以英国生物库的支气管图谱为例，我们观察到使用FactorVAE或beta-VAE相比标准VAE或非变分自动编码器，可以改善哮喘和慢性阻塞性肺疾病的全基因组显著位点数量、遗传力和多基因风险评分的性能。",
