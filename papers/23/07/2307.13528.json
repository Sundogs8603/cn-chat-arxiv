    "abstract": "The emergence of generative pre-trained models has facilitated the synthesis of high-quality text, but it has also posed challenges in identifying factual errors in the generated text. In particular: (1) A wider range of tasks now face an increasing risk of containing factual errors when handled by generative models. (2) Generated texts tend to be lengthy and lack a clearly defined granularity for individual facts. (3) There is a scarcity of explicit evidence available during the process of fact checking. With the above challenges in mind, in this paper, we propose FacTool, a task and domain agnostic framework for detecting factual errors of texts generated by large language models (e.g., ChatGPT). Experiments on four different tasks (knowledge-based QA, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and scientific literature review) show the efficacy of the proposed method.",

    "translated_abstract": "生成式预训练模型的出现方便了高质量文本的合成，但也在识别生成文本中的事实错误方面提出了挑战。本文针对以下问题提出了FacTool框架：（1）越来越多的任务由生成模型处理时，存在着包含事实错误的风险；（2）生成的文本往往很长，缺乏清晰定义的细粒度个体事实；（3）在事实检查过程中缺乏明确的证据。我们在四个不同的任务上进行实验（基于知识的问答、代码生成、数学推理和科学文献综述），证明了该方法的有效性。",
