    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统对于为用户提供个性化服务非常重要，但大量收集的用户数据引发了有关隐私（如敏感数据）、安全（如恶意数据）和效用（如有害数据）的担忧。为了解决这些挑战，推荐系统遗忘成为一种有前途的方法，允许特定数据和模型被遗忘，以减轻敏感/恶意/有害用户数据的风险。然而，现有的方法通常难以在完整性、效用和效率之间取得平衡，即在其中一个方面妥协，导致子优化的推荐系统遗忘。本文提出了一种Interaction and Mapping Matrices Correction (IMCorrect)方法来进行推荐系统遗忘。首先，我们揭示了许多协同过滤算法可以被制定为基于映射的方法，其中推荐结果可以通过将用户-物品交互矩阵与映射矩阵相乘来获得。然后，IMC",
