    "translated_abstract": "近年来，生成对抗网络（GANs）因其在生成可用于多种目的的合成数据方面的能力而引起了广泛关注。虽然GAN已经成功地生成了复制原始数据集动态的合成数据样本，但合成数据的有效性和潜在的隐私问题仍然是不容忽视的挑战。在本研究中，我们设计了一个级联表格GAN框架（CasTGAN），用于生成逼真的表格数据，并特别关注输出的有效性。在这个上下文中，有效性是指在真实数据中存在的特征之间的依赖关系，通常被传统的生成模型所误解。我们的关键思想是采用级联架构，其中专门的生成器对每个特征进行采样，使得合成输出更能代表真实数据。我们的实验结果显示，CasTGAN能够产生更真实有效的合成表格数据。",
