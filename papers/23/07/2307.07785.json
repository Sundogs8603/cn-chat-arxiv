    "abstract": "The problem of model selection is considered for the setting of interpolating estimators, where the number of model parameters exceeds the size of the dataset. Classical information criteria typically consider the large-data limit, penalizing model size. However, these criteria are not appropriate in modern settings where overparameterized models tend to perform well. For any overparameterized model, we show that there exists a dual underparameterized model that possesses the same marginal likelihood, thus establishing a form of Bayesian duality. This enables more classical methods to be used in the overparameterized setting, revealing the Interpolating Information Criterion, a measure of model quality that naturally incorporates the choice of prior into the model selection. Our new information criterion accounts for prior misspecification, geometric and spectral properties of the model, and is numerically consistent with known empirical and theoretical behavior in this regime.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了过参数化估计器的模型选择问题，其中模型参数的数量超过数据集的大小。传统的信息准则通常考虑大数据极限，对模型大小进行惩罚。然而，在现代设置中，这些准则不适用，因为过参数化模型往往表现良好。对于任何过参数化模型，我们证明存在一个对偶的欠参数化模型，具有相同的边缘似然性，从而建立了贝叶斯对偶形式。这使得过参数化设置中可以使用更多经典方法，揭示了插值信息准则，一种自然地将先验选择纳入模型选择的模型质量度量。我们的新信息准则考虑了先验误设、模型的几何和谱特性，并且在该区域与已知的经验和理论行为一致。",
