    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种测试和监测时间变量之间结构关系的方法。使用滞后相关矩阵的第一个特征值的分布（Tracy-Widom分布），来测试变量之间的结构时间关系与备选假设（独立性）相对。该分布研究了最大特征值随滞后的渐近动态。通过分析具有不同滞后的$2\\times 2$相关矩阵的最大特征值的标准差的时间序列，我们可以分析与Tracy-Widom分布的偏离，以测试这两个时间变量之间的结构关系，这些关系可以与因果关系相关联。我们使用不同滞后的第一个特征值的标准差作为测试和监测结构因果关系的代理。该方法被应用于分析零售经纪商每日货币流量之间的因果依赖关系。",
