    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLM)领域取得了显著进展，其知识存储能力接近人类。此外，通过使用提示学习和强化学习等先进技术，可以解决LLM的伦理问题和妄想问题，使其更加接近人类价值观。这自然引发了一个问题，具有类似人类能力的LLM是否具有类似人类的个性？本文旨在探讨使用Myers-Briggs类型指标(MBTI)，一种广泛使用的人格评估工具，作为LLM评估指标的可行性。具体而言，将进行大量实验来研究：1）不同LLM的个性类型，2）通过提示工程改变个性类型的可能性，3）训练数据集如何影响模型的个性。尽管MBTI不是严格的评估工具，但仍然可以用来评估LLM的个性特征。",
