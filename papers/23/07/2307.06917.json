    "abstract": "Knowledge Graphs (KG) provide us with a structured, flexible, transparent, cross-system, and collaborative way of organizing our knowledge and data across various domains in society and industrial as well as scientific disciplines. KGs surpass any other form of representation in terms of effectiveness. However, Knowledge Graph Engineering (KGE) requires in-depth experiences of graph structures, web technologies, existing models and vocabularies, rule sets, logic, as well as best practices. It also demands a significant amount of work. Considering the advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their interfaces and applications in recent years, we have conducted comprehensive experiments with ChatGPT to explore its potential in supporting KGE. In this paper, we present a selection of these experiments and their results to demonstrate how ChatGPT can assist us in the development and management of KGs.",

    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱提供了一个结构化、灵活、透明、跨系统和协作的方式来组织社会和工业以及科学学科中各个领域的知识和数据。知识图谱在有效性方面超越了任何其他形式的表示。然而，知识图谱工程需要对图结构、网络技术、现有模型和词汇、规则集、逻辑以及最佳实践有深入的了解，同时还需要大量的工作。考虑到最近大规模语言模型（LLM）及其接口和应用的进展，我们对ChatGPT进行了全面实验，探索其在支持知识图谱工程方面的潜力。在本文中，我们展示了其中一些实验及其结果，以展示ChatGPT如何辅助我们开发和管理知识图谱。",
