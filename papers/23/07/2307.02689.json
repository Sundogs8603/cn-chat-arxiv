    "translated_abstract": "基于文本的强化学习代理通常是基于神经网络的模型，使用嵌入式表示学习无法解释的策略，往往不能很好地推广到未知的游戏。而神经符号方法，特别是利用中间形式表示的方法，在语言理解任务中受到了重视。这是因为它们具有从内部可解释性、对训练数据要求较少以及在未知数据情况下具有泛化能力的优势。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一个模块化的NEuro-Symbolic Textual Agent (NESTA)方法，它将通用的语义解析器与规则归纳系统相结合，学习抽象可解释的规则作为策略。我们在已建立的基于文本的游戏基准上进行实验，结果显示所提出的NESTA方法在未知测试游戏上具有更好的泛化能力，并能够从中进行学习。",
