    "translated_abstract": "通过它们与多个器官的相互作用，人体肠道微生物群落已被证明对机体的众多生理功能起着贡献，并且还与一系列病理条件有关。过去几十年的大量研究工作已经提供了有关肠道微生物群落的相对分类分布的有价值的信息，可以实现个体化医学。然而，微生物组数据存在类别不平衡和高维度问题，这些问题必须加以解决。在本研究中，我们实施了数据工程算法来解决与微生物组数据相关的上述问题。我们在以囊性纤维化婴儿的先前发表的数据集上实现了四种标准机器学习分类器（逻辑回归 (LR)、支持向量机 (SVM)、随机森林 (RF) 和极限梯度提升 (XGB) 决策树），并比较了不同分类器的性能。本研究结果表明，数据工程方法能有效解决微生物组数据中的类别不平衡和高维度问题，从而提高医学决策的准确性。",
