    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）常常被错误地认为具有个性或一套价值观。我们认为LLMs可以看作是具有不同价值观和个性特征的角度叠加。LLMs表现出依赖于上下文的价值观和个性特征，这些特征基于产生的角度而改变（与人类相反，人类在不同情境下通常具有更一致的价值观和个性特征）。我们引入了“角度可控性”的概念，指的是模型采用不同具有不同价值观和个性特征的角度的能力。在我们的实验中，我们使用心理学问卷（PVQ、VSM、IPIP）来研究展示的价值观和个性特征如何基于不同角度而改变。通过定性实验，我们展示了当提示中（隐式或显式）暗示了某些价值观时，LLMs表达出不同的价值观，即使在没有明显暗示的情况下，LLMs也会表达出不同的价值观。",
