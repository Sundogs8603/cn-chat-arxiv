    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于扩散的图生成模型在图生成方面取得了有希望的结果。然而，现有的基于扩散的图生成模型大多是一次性的生成模型，它们在去量化的邻接矩阵空间中应用高斯扩散。这种策略可能在模型训练困难、采样速度慢和无法集成约束方面存在问题。我们提出了一种用于图生成的自回归扩散模型。与现有方法不同的是，我们定义了一种在离散图空间中直接进行的节点吸收扩散过程。对于前向扩散，我们设计了一个称为“扩散排序网络”的网络，它从图的拓扑中学习到了数据相关的节点吸收顺序。对于逆向生成，我们设计了一个称为“去噪网络”的网络，它利用逆向节点排序以及之前去噪的节点来高效地重构图，通过预测新节点的类型和边与之前去噪节点的时间。基于置换的图表示，我们提出了一种有效的训练策略，并在多个数据集上进行了实验验证，结果表明我们的模型可以生成具有多样性的高质量图形。",
