    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型视觉语言模型在视觉信息的感知和推理能力方面取得了显著进展。然而，如何有效评估这些大型视觉语言模型仍然是一个主要障碍，阻碍了未来模型的发展。传统的基准测试，如VQAv2或COCO Caption提供了定量的性能测量，但在细粒度能力评估和非鲁棒评估指标方面存在不足。最近的主观基准测试，如OwlEval，通过整合人力资源，对模型的能力进行了全面评估，但不可扩展并且存在显著的偏见。针对这些挑战，我们提出了MMBench，一种新型的多模态基准测试。MMBench系统地开发了一个全面的评估流程，主要由两个元素组成。第一个元素是精心策划的数据集，在评估数量和多样性方面超越了现有的类似基准测试。",
