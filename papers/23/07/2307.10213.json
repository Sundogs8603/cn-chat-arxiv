    "abstract": "Discriminatory language and biases are often present in hate speech during conversations, which usually lead to negative impacts on targeted groups such as those based on race, gender, and religion. To tackle this issue, we propose an approach that involves a two-step process: first, detecting hate speech using a classifier, and then utilizing a debiasing component that generates less biased or unbiased alternatives through prompts. We evaluated our approach on a benchmark dataset and observed reduction in negativity due to hate speech comments. The proposed method contributes to the ongoing efforts to reduce biases in online discourse and promote a more inclusive and fair environment for communication.",

    "translated_abstract": "歧视性语言和偏见通常在对话中存在，这通常对基于种族、性别和宗教的目标群体产生负面影响。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个双步骤的方法：首先，使用分类器检测仇恨言论，然后利用一个去偏见组件通过提示生成更少偏见或无偏见的替代语言。我们在一个基准数据集上评估了我们的方法，并观察到仇恨言论导致的负面性减少。该方法对于减少在线讨论中的偏见，促进更具包容性和公平性的沟通环境的努力有所贡献。",
