    "translated_abstract": "随机游走异常检测(RWAD)通常用于在各种应用中识别异常模式。RWAD的一个有趣特点是输入图可以是预先存在的，也可以由原始特征构建而来。因此，对于RWAD有两种潜在的攻击方式：图空间攻击和特征空间攻击。本文通过设计实际的双重空间攻击，探究了图空间攻击和特征空间攻击之间的相互作用。为此，我们进行了深入的复杂性分析，证明了攻击RWAD是NP难的。然后，我们将图空间攻击形式化为双层优化问题，并提出了两种解决策略：交替迭代攻击(alterI-attack)或利用随机游走模型的闭合解(cf-attack)。最后，我们利用图空间攻击的结果来指导设计更强大的特征空间攻击(即，图引导攻击)。",
