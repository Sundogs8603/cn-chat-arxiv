    "translated_abstract": "脆弱的道路使用者，如行人和自行车手，更容易卷入与机动车辆的事故中，并且与脆弱道路使用者有关的事故更容易导致严重伤害或死亡。信号灯路口是脆弱道路使用者的主要安全隐患，因其复杂和动态的特性，强调了理解这些道路使用者如何与机动车辆互动，并采用基于证据的对策来提高安全性能的必要性。由于涉及脆弱道路使用者的事故相对较少，很难理解其中的潜在因素。一种替代方法是识别和使用脆弱道路使用者与机动车辆之间的冲突作为安全性能的替代品。利用基于视频的系统自动检测这些冲突是发展智能基础设施以提高脆弱道路使用者安全性的关键步骤。宾夕法尼亚交通部进行了一项研究，使用基于视频的事件监控系统来评估脆弱道路使用者和机动车辆的冲突情况。",
