    "translated_abstract": "因果推断研究是否存在一个变量影响观测结果。通过诸如“平均治疗效果”等量化指标，这一范式在许多生物领域中被采用，从疫苗和药物开发到政策干预。不幸的是，大多数方法通常仅限于单变量结果。我们的工作将因果估计泛化到任意维度或可测空间的结果，并将传统的因果估计形式化为名义变量的因果偏差测试。我们提出了一种简单的技术来调整一致性条件独立性测试，并证明了这些测试是一致性因果偏差测试。数值实验表明，与现有策略相比，我们的方法Causal CDcorr在有限样本有效性和功率方面均有改进。我们的方法都是开源的，可在github.com/ebridge2/cdcorr上获得。",
