    "abstract": "The aging population has led to a growing number of falls in our society, affecting global public health worldwide. This paper presents CareFall, an automatic Fall Detection System (FDS) based on wearable devices and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods. CareFall considers the accelerometer and gyroscope time signals extracted from a smartwatch. Two different approaches are used for feature extraction and classification: i) threshold-based, and ii) machine learning-based. Experimental results on two public databases show that the machine learning-based approach, which combines accelerometer and gyroscope information, outperforms the threshold-based approach in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. This research contributes to the design of smart and user-friendly solutions to mitigate the negative consequences of falls among older people.",

    "translated_abstract": "人口老龄化导致了全球范围内跌倒事件的增多，对全球公共健康产生了影响。本文提出了CareFall，一种基于可穿戴设备和人工智能方法的自动跌倒检测系统（FDS）。CareFall利用从智能手表提取的加速度计和陀螺仪时间信号。采用了两种不同的特征提取和分类方法：一是基于阈值的方法，二是基于机器学习的方法。在两个公共数据库上的实验结果表明，将加速度计和陀螺仪信息结合使用的机器学习方法在准确率、敏感性和特异性方面优于基于阈值的方法。该研究为设计智能且用户友好的解决方案，缓解老年人跌倒的负面后果作出了贡献。",
