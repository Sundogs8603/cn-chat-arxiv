    "translated_abstract": "视频问答(VidQA)在智能交通监控和智能交通系统领域有着显著的潜力，可以促进先进的机器推理能力。然而，在先前的研究中，将城市交通场景知识整合到VidQA系统中的注意力有限。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，称为带有自动字幕的交通领域视频问答(TRIVIA)，它作为一种弱监督技术，将交通领域知识注入到大型视频语言模型中。从SUTD-TrafficQA任务中获得的实证结果凸显了TRIVIA所取得的显著改进，将代表性视频语言模型的准确率提高了6.5个点(19.88%)，相比于基线设置。这种开创性的方法对推动该领域的进步充满了潜力，激励着研究人员和实践者们发掘其全部潜能。",
