    "translated_abstract": "在映射企业应用程序中，数据映射仍然是集成开发的基本部分，但其耗时较长。越来越多的应用程序缺乏命名标准，嵌套字段结构进一步增加了集成开发者的复杂性。一旦映射完成，数据转换是用户面临的下一个挑战，因为每个应用程序都希望数据以一定的格式存在。此外，在构建集成流程时，开发人员需要了解源数据字段和目标数据字段的格式，并设计出可以将数据从源格式转换为目标格式的转换程序。自人工智能 (AI) 的早期以来，通过程序综合范式自动生成转换程序的问题一直受到研究。编程示例 (PBE) 就是这样一种技术，目标是自动推理出一个计算机程序，以完成用户提供的格式或字符串转换任务。",
