    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于平稳时间序列数据构建的统计功能的通用置信区间过程（CIP）。我们提出的方法是基于推导出的$\\chi^2$和学生t分布的统计功能上的无分布模拟的变量，因此适用于包括分位数估计、梯度估计、M估计、CVAR估计和到达过程速率估计在内的各种设置，除了传统的统计设置。与次抽样方法类似，我们使用重叠的时间序列批次来估计潜在的方差参数；然而，与次抽样和自助法不同，我们假设统计功能的暗指点估计符合中心极限定理（CLT），以帮助识别批量学生化统计量的弱渐近性（称为OB-x极限，x=I,II,III）。OB-x极限是由Wiener过程的某些功能参数化所得。",
