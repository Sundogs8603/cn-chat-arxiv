    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新的自监督合理化方法，称为KGRec，用于知识感知的推荐系统。为了有效地识别有信息量的知识连接，我们提出了一种关注知识合理化机制，为知识三元组生成合理化得分。通过这些得分，KGRec通过合理化掩码集成生成和对比度自监督任务进行推荐。为了突出知识图谱中的合理性，我们设计了一种以掩码重建形式的新型生成任务。通过使用高合理化得分对重要知识进行掩码，KGRec被训练来重建并突出有用的知识连接，作为合理的依据。为了进一步合理化协同交互对知识图谱学习的影响，我们引入了一种对比度学习任务，对齐来自知识和用户-物品交互视图的信号。为了确保对比度的抗噪声性，通过判断两个图中的潜在噪声边缘，",
