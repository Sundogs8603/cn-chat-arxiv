    "abstract": "Medical radiography segmentation, and specifically dental radiography, is highly limited by the cost of labeling which requires specific expertise and labor-intensive annotations. In this work, we propose a straightforward pre-training method for semantic segmentation leveraging Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which have shown impressive results for generative modeling. Our straightforward approach achieves remarkable performance in terms of label efficiency and does not require architectural modifications between pre-training and downstream tasks. We propose to first pre-train a Unet by exploiting the DDPM training objective, and then fine-tune the resulting model on a segmentation task. Our experimental results on the segmentation of dental radiographs demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with state-of-the-art pre-training methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "医学放射学分割，尤其是牙科放射学分割，受到标记成本的严重限制，需要具有特定专业知识和繁重的注释。本文提出了一种简单的预训练方法，利用去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）进行语义分割，该模型在生成建模方面显示出令人印象深刻的结果。我们的简单方法在标签效率方面取得了显著的性能，并且在预训练和后续任务之间不需要架构修改。我们提议首先通过利用DDPM训练目标对Unet进行预训练，然后在分割任务上对得到的模型进行微调。我们对牙科放射片的分割的实验结果表明，所提出的方法与最先进的预训练方法相竞争。",
