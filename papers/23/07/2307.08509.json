    "translated_abstract": "单细胞技术为我们提供了关于基因表达和表观遗传修饰等分子特征的宝贵信息。然而，以控制和强有力的方式比较这些复杂分布面临着方法论上的挑战。本文提出利用基于核嵌入的核测试框架来非线性比较细胞间复杂分子特征的分布。我们的框架不仅允许对特征进行分析，还能在考虑了它们之间复杂依赖关系的情况下进行转录组或表观组的全局比较。通过使用分类器基于核嵌入的变异性来区分细胞，我们的方法可以发现在细胞群体中原本无法察觉到的异质性。我们展示了核测试方法如何克服专门用于单细胞的差异分析方法的局限性。我们还将核测试应用于研究分化逆转的过程。",

By using kernel embedding and variability analysis, the method is able to uncover hidden heterogeneities in cell populations. The authors demonstrate that kernel testing overcomes the limitations of existing differential analysis methods for single-cell and apply it to investigate the reversion process of differentiation."
