    "translated_abstract": "近年来，量子计算在计算密集型任务方面显示出相当大的潜力。例如，基于量子神经网络（QNN）的分类任务引起了研究人员的极大兴趣，并在各种场景中进行了评估。然而，由于量子计算资源受限或需要大量经典后处理，目前大多数量子分类器仅适用于二分类任务。在本文中，我们提出了一个高效的量子多分类器MORE，该分类器以测量和相关性为基础构建了变分量子多分类器。MORE使用与二分类器相同的变分式设计并通过充分利用单个读出量子位的量子信息来执行多分类。为了从读出量子位提取完整信息，我们选择了三个可观测量作为二维希尔伯特空间的基。然后，我们使用量子态重构技术对量子状态进行了重建。",
