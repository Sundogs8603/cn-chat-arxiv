    "translated_abstract": "分布式学习常用于训练深度学习模型，特别是大型模型。在分布式学习中，手动并行化方法需要大量人力，并且灵活性有限。因此，最近提出了自动并行化方法来自动化并行策略优化过程。现有的自动并行化方法存在次优解的问题，因为它们不会同时优化跨层并行化和内层并行化这两个类别的并行策略。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为UniAP的新型自动并行化方法，通过混合整数二次规划统一跨层和内层的自动并行化。据我们所知，UniAP是第一种能够同时优化这两个类别的并行策略以求得最优解的并行化方法。实验结果表明，UniAP在吞吐量方面胜过了最先进的方法，提高了最多1.71倍，并减少了策略优化的时间。",
