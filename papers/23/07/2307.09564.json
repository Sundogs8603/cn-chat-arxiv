    "translated_abstract": "程序综合是根据规范自动生成代码的任务。在语法引导综合（SyGuS）中，规范是一个语法模板和一个逻辑公式的组合，生成的代码被证明满足规范。像SyGuS这样的技术对于确保正确的综合结果至关重要。尽管机器学习在其他类型的程序综合中已经得到广泛应用，但在SyGuS中目前的技术仍然主要依赖自动推理工具和简单的枚举方法。我们假设这是由于搜索问题的复杂性和可用数据集相对较小的原因。在这项工作中，我们通过将通用SyGuS问题构建为树搜索，并基于Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)提出了一种强化学习引导的SyGuS综合算法。我们的算法结合了学习的策略和值函数与用于平衡探索和利用的树的上限置信度。",
