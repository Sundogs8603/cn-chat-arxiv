Given a fixed budget of tokens, we study how to best select data that leads to good downstream model performance across tasks. We develop a new framework based on a simple hypothesis: just as humans acquire interdependent skills in a deliberate order, language models also follow a natural order when learning a set of skills from their training data. If such an order exists, it can be utilized for improved understanding of LMs and for data-efficient training. Using this intuition, our framework formalizes the notion of a skill and of an ordered set of skills in terms of the associated data. First, using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate that these ordered skill sets exist, and that their existence enables more advanced skills to be learned with less data when we train on their prerequisite skills. Second, using our proposed framework, we introduce an online data sampling algorithm",

    "translated_abstract": "训练数据的质量对于预训练的大型语言模型的性能有重要影响。在固定的token预算下，我们研究如何选择能够在各个任务中获得良好下游模型性能的数据。我们提出了一个新的框架，基于一个简单的假设：人类在有意义的顺序中获得相互依赖的技能，语言模型在学习一组技能时也会遵循这样的顺序。如果存在这样的顺序，可以用于改进对语言模型的理解和数据高效训练。利用这种直觉，我们的框架将技能的概念和有序的技能集合的概念形式化为相关数据。首先，使用合成数据和真实数据，我们证明了这些有序的技能集合的存在，并且它们的存在使得在训练其先决条件技能时可以使用更少的数据来学习更高级的技能。其次，使用我们提出的框架，我们介绍了一种在线数据采样算法。",
