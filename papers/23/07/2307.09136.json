    "abstract": "Mixed sample data augmentation (MSDA) is a widely used technique that has been found to improve performance in a variety of tasks. However, in this paper, we show that the effects of MSDA are class-dependent, with some classes seeing an improvement in performance while others experience a decline. To reduce class dependency, we propose the DropMix method, which excludes a specific percentage of data from the MSDA computation. By training on a combination of MSDA and non-MSDA data, the proposed method not only improves the performance of classes that were previously degraded by MSDA, but also increases overall average accuracy, as shown in experiments on two datasets (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) using three MSDA methods (Mixup, CutMix and PuzzleMix).",

    "translated_abstract": "混合样本数据增强（MSDA）是一种广泛应用的技术，已被证明可以提高各种任务的性能。然而，在本文中，我们展示了MSDA的效果是与类别相关的，一些类别的性能得到了改进，而其他类别则出现了下降。为了减少类别相关性，我们提出了DropMix方法，在MSDA计算中排除了特定比例的数据。通过在MSDA和非MSDA数据的组合上进行训练，所提出的方法不仅提高了之前由MSDA降低的类别的性能，还提高了整体的平均准确率，在使用三种MSDA方法（Mixup、CutMix和PuzzleMix）对两个数据集（CIFAR-100和ImageNet）进行的实验证明了这一点。",
