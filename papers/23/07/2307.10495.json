    "translated_abstract": "主动学习通过精选一小部分未标记的数据点来优化机器学习方法的性能，目的是最大程度地提高底层分类器的性能。最近在合成孔径雷达(SAR)数据方面取得了一些顺序主动学习的进展。在每次迭代中，顺序主动学习选择一个大小为一的查询集合，而批量主动学习选择一个包含多个数据点的查询集合。尽管批量主动学习方法更加高效，但是相对于顺序主动学习方法，保持模型准确性的挑战在于困难。我们开发了一种新颖的两部分批量主动学习方法：Dijkstra的Annulus Core-Set(DAC)用于核心集合生成，以及批次抽样用于局部最大值。使用结合了DAC和LocalMax的批量主动学习过程可以达到几乎与顺序主动学习相同的准确性，但更加高效，与批次规模成正比。",
