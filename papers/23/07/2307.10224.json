    "translated_abstract": "视觉强化学习（Visual RL）与高维观察相结合，一直面临着长期存在的泛化挑战。尽管有重点研究用于解决视觉泛化问题的算法，但我们认为现有的基准存在问题，因为它们局限于孤立的任务和泛化类别，从而削弱了对代理人视觉泛化能力的全面评估。为了弥合这一差距，我们引入了RL-ViGen：一种新型的用于视觉泛化的强化学习基准，其中包含多样的任务和广泛的泛化类型，从而促进得出更可靠的结论。此外，RL-ViGen将最新的泛化视觉强化学习算法融入到一个统一的框架中，实验结果表明，没有单一的现有算法在所有任务上普遍占优势。我们的愿景是RL-ViGen将在这个领域起到催化剂的作用。",
