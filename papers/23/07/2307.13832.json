    "translated_abstract": "加密货币交易是一个新兴的研究领域，在行业中越来越受到采用。由于其去中心化的特性，许多描述加密货币的指标可以通过简单的谷歌搜索获得，并且通常会定期更新，至少每天更新一次。这为数据驱动的系统交易研究提供了一个有前途的机会，可以通过额外的特征（如哈希率或谷歌趋势）来增强有限的历史数据。然而，一个自然而然的问题出现了：如何有效地选择和处理这些特征？在本文中，我们引入了多因素入门网络(MFIN)，这是一个端到端的多资产和多因素系统交易框架。MFIN将深度入门网络(DIN)扩展到多因素环境中。与DIN类似，MFIN模型可以自动从回报数据中学习特征，并输出优化投资组合夏普比率的头寸大小。与一系列基于规则的动量和回归策略相比，MFIN可以提供更好的表现。",
