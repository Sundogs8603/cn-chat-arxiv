These matrices are highly interpretable and very useful in practice, but they come at the high computational cost of solving an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. To reduce the computational burden, we propose to relax BMF continuously using a novel elastic-binary regularizer, from which we derive a proximal gradient algorithm. Through an extensive set of experiments, we demonstrate that our method works well in practice: On synthetic data, we show that it converges quickly, recovers the ground truth precisely, and estimates the simulated rank exactly.

    "translated_abstract": "为了解决非负矩阵分解在布尔数据上的可解释性问题，布尔矩阵分解（BMF）使用布尔代数将输入分解为低秩布尔因子矩阵。这些矩阵具有很高的可解释性，在实践中非常有用，但需要解决一个NP难的组合优化问题，计算成本较高。为了减轻计算负担，我们提出了一种通过连续松弛BMF的新型弹性二元正则化器，从中推导出一种近端梯度算法。通过大量的实验，我们证明我们的方法在实践中表现良好：在合成数据上，我们展示了它快速收敛，精确恢复了真实值，并准确估计了模拟秩。在实际数据上，我们在召回率、损失和运行时间方面优于现有技术，并且来自医学领域的案例研究证实了我们的结果易于解释和语义有意义。",
