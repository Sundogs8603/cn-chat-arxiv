    "translated_abstract": "对于真实世界的应用，机器人需要通过与用户有限的交互不断地在环境中学习。在这方面，之前的研究在少样本类增量学习（FSCIL）和主动类别选择（ACS）方面取得了有希望的结果，但是测试都在约束的设置中进行。因此，在本文中，我们结合了FSCIL和ACS的思想，提出了一个新的框架，可以让自主代理通过要求用户仅对环境中最具信息量的少数对象进行标注来不断学习新对象。为此，我们在基于最新技术的FSCIL模型基础上，加入了ACS文献中的一些技术进行扩展。我们把这个模型命名为Few-shot Incremental Active class SeleCtiOn（FIASco）。我们进一步将基于潜力场的导航技术与我们的模型集成在一起，开发了一个完整的框架，使代理能够通过FIASco模型对其感知数据进行处理和推理，并朝最具信息量的对象导航。",
