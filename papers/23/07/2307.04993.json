    "abstract": "Precise measurements of the black hole mass are essential to gain insight on the black hole and host galaxy co-evolution. A direct measure of the black hole mass is often restricted to nearest galaxies and instead, an indirect method using the single-epoch virial black hole mass estimation is used for objects at high redshifts. However, this method is subjected to biases and uncertainties as it is reliant on the scaling relation from a small sample of local active galactic nuclei. In this study, we propose the application of conformalised quantile regression (CQR) to quantify the uncertainties of the black hole predictions in a machine learning setting. We compare CQR with various prediction interval techniques and demonstrated that CQR can provide a more useful prediction interval indicator. In contrast to baseline approaches for prediction interval estimation, we show that the CQR method provides prediction intervals that adjust to the black hole mass and its related properties. That",

    "translated_abstract": "精确测量黑洞质量对于理解黑洞和宿主星系的共同演化至关重要。直接测量黑洞质量通常仅限于最近的星系，而高红移的物体则使用间接方法，即利用单次纪元的维里黑洞质量估计。然而，该方法受到偏差和不确定性的影响，因为其依赖于一个小样本的本地活动星系核的比例关系。在这项研究中，我们提出了将符合化分位数回归（CQR）应用于机器学习设置中，以量化黑洞预测的不确定性。我们将CQR与各种预测区间技术进行比较，并证明CQR可以提供更有用的预测区间指标。与基准方法相比，我们展示了CQR方法能够调整到黑洞质量及其相关属性。",
