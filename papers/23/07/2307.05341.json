    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了非参数情境赌博，其中Lipschitz均值奖励函数可能随时间变化。我们首先在这个较少被理解的情境下建立了动态遗憾率的极小极大值，这些值与变化数量L和总变差V有关，两者都可以捕捉到上下文空间的所有分布变化，并且证明了目前的方法在这个情境下是次优的。接下来，我们探讨了这种情境下的适应性问题，即在不知道L或V的情况下实现极小极大值。非常重要的是，我们认为，在给定的上下文X_t处，赌博问题在上下文空间其他部分中的奖励变化不应该产生影响。因此，我们提出了一种变化的概念，我们称之为经验显著变化，更好地考虑了局部性，因此比L和V计数更少。此外，类似于最近在非平稳多臂赌博机中的工作（Suk和Kpotufe，2022），经验显著变化只计算显著变化。",
