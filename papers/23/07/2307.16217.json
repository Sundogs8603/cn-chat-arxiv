    "translated_abstract": "结合计算技术和人文学科是一项持续进行的努力，旨在使文本、图像、音频、视频和其他艺术品等资源在数字化时代易于获得、可搜索和可分析。在近年来，深度神经网络（DNN）在自动文本分析和自然语言处理（NLP）领域占据主导地位，有时呈现出超人类的表现。DNN是解决数字人文研究中与NLP相关的许多任务（例如拼写检查、语言检测、实体提取、作者检测、问答等）的最先进的机器学习算法。这些有监督算法从大量的“正确”和“错误”示例中学习模式，并将其应用于新的示例。然而，在数字人文研究中使用DNN分析文本资源存在两个主要挑战：（不）可用的训练数据和领域适应的需求。本文通过分析多个使用案例来探讨这些挑战。",
