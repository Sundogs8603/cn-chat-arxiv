    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型在机器人装配序列规划中需要对预测的解决方案进行自省，即判断其可行性，以避免潜在的效率降低。之前的研究在训练时需要可行和不可行的示例。然而，当需要重新训练以适应新的产品变体时，收集足够的不可行示例是困难的。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种只需要可行示例的基于密度的可行性学习方法。具体地，我们将可行性学习问题形式化为使用归一化流进行分布区分，归一化流是用于估计复杂概率分布的强大生成模型。实验结果表明，所提出的方法在机器人装配案例中表现优于其他单分类基线模型，能够检测出不可行的装配方案。我们进一步研究了该方法的内部工作机理，并展示了一个大规模的记忆机制。",
