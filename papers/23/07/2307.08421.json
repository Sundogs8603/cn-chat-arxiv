    "abstract": "To achieve a highly agile and flexible production, it is envisioned that industrial production systems gradually become more decentralized, interconnected, and intelligent. Within this vision, production assets collaborate with each other, exhibiting a high degree of autonomy. Furthermore, knowledge about individual production assets is readily available throughout their entire life-cycles. To realize this vision, adequate use of information technology is required. Two commonly applied software paradigms in this context are Software Agents (referred to as Agents) and Digital Twins (DTs). This work presents a systematic comparison of Agents and DTs in industrial applications. The goal of the study is to determine the differences, similarities, and potential synergies between the two paradigms. The comparison is based on the purposes for which Agents and DTs are applied, the properties and capabilities exhibited by these software paradigms, and how they can be allocated within the Refere",

    "translated_abstract": "为了实现高度灵活和可变的生产，工业生产系统逐渐变得更加分散、互联和智能化。在这个愿景中，生产资产彼此合作，展示高度的自主性。此外，个体生产资产的知识在它们整个生命周期中是随时可用的。为了实现这个愿景，需要充分利用信息技术。在这个背景下，两种常用的软件范式是软件代理（简称代理）和数字孪生（DT）。本研究对工业应用中的代理和数字孪生进行了系统比较。研究的目标是确定这两种范式之间的差异、相似之处和潜在的协同作用。比较基于代理和数字孪生的应用目的、这些软件范式展示的属性和能力，以及它们如何在参考框架中分配。",
