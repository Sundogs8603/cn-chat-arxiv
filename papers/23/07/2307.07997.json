    "translated_abstract": "现实而有用的合成数据具有很大的潜力。然而，当前合成表格数据生成的评估方法主要关注下游任务的有用性，往往忽视了统计属性的重要性。这种疏忽在低样本情况下尤为明显，伴随着这些统计指标的迅速恶化。在本文中，我们通过对三种最先进的合成表格数据生成器在边际分布、列对相关性、联合分布和下游任务实用性表现等方面在高到低样本情况下的评估，来解决这个问题。流行的CTGAN模型在实用性方面表现强劲，但在低样本设置方面的实用性较差。为了克服这个限制，我们提出了MargCTGAN方法，通过添加特征匹配的去相关边际，从而在下游实用性和合成数据的统计属性方面实现了持续的改进。",
