    "translated_abstract": "随着社交媒体平台的不断影响力增加，开发能够检测性别歧视和其他不尊重和仇恨行为的自动化系统，以促进更具包容性和尊重性的在线环境变得至关重要。然而，考虑到不同的仇恨类别和作者的意图，尤其是在学习与分歧的机制下，这些任务相当具有挑战性。本文描述了AI-UPV团队在CLEF 2023的EXIST（社交网络中的性别歧视识别）实验室中的参与情况。所提出的方法旨在通过直接从具有分歧的数据中进行训练，而不使用任何聚合标签，来处理性别歧视识别和表征的任务。同时，报告了考虑软性和硬性评估的性能。所提出的系统使用大型语言模型（如mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa）和集成策略来进行性别歧视识别和表征。",
