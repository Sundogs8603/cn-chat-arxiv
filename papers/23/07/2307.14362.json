    "translated_abstract": "卷积神经网络(CNNs)已被证明可以从宇宙学领域中提取比传统的两点统计更多的信息，并且能够非常好地消除天体物理效应的影响。然而，CNNs需要大量的训练数据，在昂贵的宇宙学模拟领域可能存在问题，并且很难解释网络的工作原理。在本文中，我们将可学习的散射变换应用于宇宙学推断和天体物理效应边缘化的问题中，散射变换是一种使用可训练小波作为滤波器的卷积神经网络。我们提出了两个基于散射变换的模型，一个是为了性能而构建的，另一个是为了解释性而构建的，并与CNN进行了比较。我们发现，在训练数据样本较小的情况下，散射网络能够显著优于CNN。此外，我们还提出了一种轻量级的散射网络，它具有非常好的可解释性。",
