    "translated_abstract": "传统上，稀疏检索系统依赖于词汇表示来检索文档，如BM25，在信息检索任务中占主导地位。随着诸如BERT这样的预训练transformer模型的出现，神经稀疏检索引领了检索中的新范式。尽管取得了成功，但目前缺乏支持不同稀疏检索器在统一的环境中运行的软件。这妨碍了实践者公正地比较不同的稀疏模型，并获得真实的评估结果。还有一个缺失的部分是，大多数先前的工作是对稀疏检索模型进行域内检索评估，即仅在一个数据集上进行评估：MS MARCO。然而，在实际检索系统中，一个重要的要求是模型能够在未见过的域外，即零样本检索任务中具有良好的泛化能力。在这项工作中，我们提供了SPRINT，这是一个基于Pyserini和Lucene的统一Python工具包，支持神经稀疏检索的通用接口。",
