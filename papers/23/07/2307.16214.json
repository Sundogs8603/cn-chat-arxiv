    "translated_abstract": "随着用户生成的家族谱越来越流行，新的家族谱信息系统得到了开发。最先进的自然语言问答算法使用基于自注意力网络的深度神经网络（DNN）架构。然而，其中一些模型使用基于序列的输入，不适合处理基于图的结构，而基于图的DNN模型则依赖于在家族谱领域中不存在的高度全面的知识图。此外，这些有监督的DNN模型需要在家族谱领域中缺乏的训练数据集。本研究提出了一种用于家族谱问答的端到端方法：1）将家族谱数据表示为知识图，2）将其转换为文本，3）与非结构化文本结合，4）训练基于Transformer的问答模型。为了评估需要专门方法的必要性，对比了微调模式下的模型与使用我们提出的方法的模型。",
