    "abstract": "We consider the problem of generating periodic materials with deep models. While symmetry-aware molecule generation has been studied extensively, periodic materials possess different symmetries, which have not been completely captured by existing methods. In this work, we propose SyMat, a novel material generation approach that can capture physical symmetries of periodic material structures. SyMat generates atom types and lattices of materials through generating atom type sets, lattice lengths and lattice angles with a variational auto-encoder model. In addition, SyMat employs a score-based diffusion model to generate atom coordinates of materials, in which a novel symmetry-aware probabilistic model is used in the coordinate diffusion process. We show that SyMat is theoretically invariant to all symmetry transformations on materials and demonstrate that SyMat achieves promising performance on random generation and property optimization tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑使用深度模型生成周期性材料的问题。虽然对于对称感知的分子生成已经得到了广泛研究，但是周期性材料具有不同的对称性，现有的方法并不能完全捕捉到这些对称性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的材料生成方法SyMat，能够捕捉周期性材料结构的物理对称性。SyMat利用变分自动编码器模型生成材料的原子类型和晶格，通过生成原子类型集、晶格长度和晶格角度。此外，SyMat采用基于评分的扩散模型生成材料的原子坐标，在坐标扩散过程中使用了一种新的对称感知概率模型。我们证明SyMat在所有材料的对称变换上理论上是不变的，并且证明了SyMat在随机生成和性能优化任务上取得了有希望的性能。",
