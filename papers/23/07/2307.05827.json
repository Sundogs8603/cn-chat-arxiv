    "abstract": "Relation extraction (RE) is the task of extracting relations between entities in text. Most RE methods extract relations from free-form running text and leave out other rich data sources, such as tables. We explore RE from the perspective of applying neural methods on tabularly organized data. We introduce a new model consisting of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional-Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) network to encode entities and learn dependencies among them, respectively. We evaluate our model on a large and recent dataset and compare results with previous neural methods. Experimental results show that our model consistently outperforms the previous model for the task of relation extraction on tabular data. We perform comprehensive error analyses and ablation study to show the contribution of various components of our model. Finally, we discuss the usefulness and trade-offs of our approach, and provide suggestions for fostering further research.",

    "translated_abstract": "关系抽取是从文本中提取实体之间关系的任务。大部分关系抽取方法从自由格式的连续文本中提取关系，而忽略了其他丰富的数据来源，比如表格。我们从应用神经网络方法处理表格化数据的角度探索关系抽取。我们引入了一个新模型，由卷积神经网络（CNN）和双向长短期记忆（BiLSTM）网络组成，分别用于编码实体和学习它们之间的依赖关系。我们在一个大规模且最新的数据集上评估了我们的模型，并与之前的神经网络方法进行了比较。实验结果显示，我们的模型在表格数据上的关系抽取任务中始终优于之前的模型。我们进行了全面的错误分析和剥离研究，以展示我们的模型的各个组成部分的贡献。最后，我们讨论了我们方法的实用性和权衡，并提供了进一步研究的建议。",
