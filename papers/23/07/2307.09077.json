An algorithm is presented to estimate the model even in the presence of billions of data points, possibly mapping covariates into a high dimensional space. The large sample size can be common for high frequency data applications using multiple liquid instruments. Convergence of the algorithm is shown, consistency results under weak conditions is established, and a test statistic to assess out of sample performance of different model specifications is suggested. The methodology is applied to the study of four stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The out of sample testing procedure suggests that capturing the nonlinearity of the order book information adds value to the self exciting nature of high frequency trading even",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究介绍了一种用于高频交易事件到达的点过程。强度是Hawkes过程和委托簿派生的高维协变量函数的乘积。讨论了该过程稳定性的条件。并提出了一种算法，即使在存在数十亿数据点的情况下，也可以进行模型估计，可能需要将协变量映射到高维空间。大样本量是常见于使用多个流动工具的高频数据应用中的情况。证明了算法的收敛性，建立了在弱条件下的一致性结果，并提出了一种测试统计量来评估不同模型规范的样本外表现。将该方法应用于纽约证券交易所（NYSE）上交易的四只股票的研究中。样本外测试过程表明，捕捉委托簿信息的非线性特征对于高频交易的自激性特征有价值。",
