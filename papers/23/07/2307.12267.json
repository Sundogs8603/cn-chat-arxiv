    "translated_abstract": "最近的大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）能够在提供具体指导的情况下生成类似于人类的流畅回答。尽管承认技术进步带来的便利，教育者也担心学生可能利用语言模型来完成写作任务并将其假冒为自己的原创作品。虽然有很多AI内容检测研究是基于这些担忧进行的，但大多数之前的研究将AI内容检测建模为一个分类问题，假设一个文本要么完全由人类编写，要么完全由AI生成。在本研究中，我们研究了AI内容检测在一个少有探索但却现实的情况下，即检测的文本由人类和生成性语言模型（即混合文本）协作编写。我们首先将检测任务形式化为从给定的混合文本中识别人类编写内容和AI生成内容之间的转换点（边界检测）。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates the AI content detection of hybrid texts, where both humans and generative language models collaborate in the writing process, in the field of education. The task is formalized as identifying the transition points between human-written and AI-generated content, aiming to distinguish between them."
