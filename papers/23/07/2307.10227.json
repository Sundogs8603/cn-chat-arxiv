    "translated_abstract": "本文延续了在非单调形式化中表示行为特性的工作线，强调了“真实”和“因果”的区别，类似于McCain和Turner引入的因果逻辑系统和Giunchiglia和Lifschitz提出的行动语言C。在语言C+中，唯一可以直接表示的流变量是真值流变量，这通常是不方便的。我们证明了因果逻辑和语言C都可以扩展以允许来自任意非空集合的值。我们称为C+的语言扩展还可以根据属性来描述动作，这在强调扩充容忍性的角度上很重要。我们描述了将C+嵌入到具有多值常量的因果理论中，将C+与Pednault的行动语言ADL相关联，并展示了如何将多值常量替换为布尔常量。",
