    "translated_abstract": "业务流程管理（BPM）旨在通过管理底层流程来改善组织活动及其结果。为实现这一目标，通常需要考虑来自各种信息源的信息，包括非结构化文本文档。因此，研究人员已经开发了几种特定于BPM的解决方案，利用自然语言处理技术从文本文档中提取信息。然而，这些解决方案是针对特定任务而设计的，并不能作为通用工具来解决多个与流程相关的问题。然而，鉴于最近出现的具有出色推理能力的大型语言模型（LLM），实现这样一个具有多个应用的通用工具现在似乎是可行的。本文将展示LLM如何通过将特定的LLM应用于三个示例任务来完成与文本相关的BPM任务：从文本描述中挖掘命令式流程模型，从文本中挖掘声明式流程模型。",
