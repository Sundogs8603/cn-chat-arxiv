    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the emergence of Long COVID, a cluster of symptoms that persist after infection. Long COVID patients may also experience mental health challenges, making it essential to understand individuals' emotional and mental well-being. This study aims to gain a deeper understanding of Long COVID individuals' emotional and mental well-being, identify the topics that most concern them, and explore potential correlations between their emotions and social media activity. Specifically, we classify tweets into four categories based on the content, detect the presence of six basic emotions, and extract prevalent topics. Our analyses reveal that negative emotions dominated throughout the study period, with two peaks during critical periods, such as the outbreak of new COVID variants. The findings of this study have implications for policy and measures for addressing the mental health challenges of individuals with Long COVID and provide a foundation for future work.",

    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19 疫情导致了长期 COVID，这是在感染后持续存在的一系列症状。长期 COVID 患者可能还会面临心理健康挑战，因此了解个体的情绪和心理健康状况至关重要。本研究旨在深入了解长期 COVID 患者的情绪和心理健康状况，确定他们最关注的主题，并探索他们的情绪与社交媒体活动之间的潜在关联。具体来说，我们根据内容将推文分类为四个类别，检测其中的六种基本情绪，并提取常见主题。我们的分析结果表明，在整个研究期间，负面情绪占主导地位，并在关键时期（如新冠变种爆发）达到两个高峰。本研究的发现对制定政策和措施以应对长期 COVID 患者的心理健康挑战具有重要意义，并为未来的工作奠定了基础。",
