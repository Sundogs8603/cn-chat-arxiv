    "translated_abstract": "传统方法对于创新的分析在广泛的结构变量方面存在根本性的局限性。本文通过开创性的ChatGPT技术采用LLM方法对专利进行分析，突破了边界。OpenAI的最先进的文本嵌入能够访问关于每个发明的质量和影响的复杂信息，用于驱动深度学习预测模型。细致的嵌入使预测专利价值的R-squared提高了24％，并明确地将最差和最佳应用程序分离开来。这些模型通过预测接受率构建的多空投资组合每年实现显著的异常收益率高达3.3%，同时也证明了市场无法及时整合有关应用程序的信息。这些模型为革命性改变科根、帕帕尼科洛、塞鲁和斯托夫曼（2017）对专利估值的更正提供了机会。",
