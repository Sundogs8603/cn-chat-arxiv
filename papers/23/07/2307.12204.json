    "translated_abstract": "我们对无声攻击对语音激活设备的分析确认了7.6的风险因素，强调了由NIST国家漏洞数据库（NVD）独立评分的重大安全漏洞。我们的基线网络模型展示了一种攻击者使用无声语音命令未经授权访问受保护笔记本上机密信息的场景。我们在该基线网络模型上模拟了许多攻击场景，揭示了通过物理访问而无需添加新硬件或增强设备技能的互联设备的大规模利用潜力来发现和拥有特权信息。使用微软的CyberBattleSim框架，我们评估了六种强化学习算法，发现深度Q学习与开发证明是最优的，可以在更少的步骤中迅速拥有所有节点。我们的研究结果强调了对非传统网络和新的网络安全措施的重要需求。",

A baseline network model is proposed, and various attack scenarios are simulated, revealing the potential for discovering and exploiting privileged information through physical access without additional hardware or device skills. The use of deep Q-learning algorithm facilitates rapid ownership of all nodes in a few steps, highlighting the need for understanding non-conventional networks and implementing new cybersecurity measures."
