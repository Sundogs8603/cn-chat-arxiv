    "abstract": "In 2015, the United Nations put forward 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030, where data has been promoted as a focus to innovating sustainable development and as a means to measuring progress towards achieving the SDGs. In this study, we propose a systematic approach towards discovering data types and sources that can be used for SDG research. The proposed method integrates a systematic mapping approach using manual qualitative coding over a corpus of SDG-related research literature followed by an automated process that applies rules to perform data entity extraction computationally. This approach is exemplified by an analysis of literature relating to SDG 7, the results of which are also presented in this paper. The paper concludes with a discussion of the approach and suggests future work to extend the method with more advance NLP and machine learning techniques.",

    "translated_abstract": "2015年，联合国提出了17个可持续发展目标（SDGs），要在2030年之前实现，在这些目标中，数据被推崇为创新可持续发展和衡量实现SDGs进展的手段。本研究提出了一种系统的方法，用于发现可用于SDG研究的数据类型和来源。所提出的方法将系统的映射方法与手动定性编码相结合，应用规则进行计算化的数据实体提取。本文以对SDG 7相关文献的分析为示例，并提供了相应的结果。本文还对该方法进行讨论，并建议未来通过更先进的自然语言处理和机器学习技术来扩展该方法。",
