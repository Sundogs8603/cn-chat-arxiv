    "abstract": "Precisely recommending candidate news articles to users has always been a core challenge for personalized news recommendation systems. Most recent works primarily focus on using advanced natural language processing techniques to extract semantic information from rich textual data, employing content-based methods derived from local historical news. However, this approach lacks a global perspective, failing to account for users' hidden motivations and behaviors beyond semantic information. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model called GLORY (Global-LOcal news Recommendation sYstem), which combines global representations learned from other users with local representations to enhance personalized recommendation systems. We accomplish this by constructing a Global-aware Historical News Encoder, which includes a global news graph and employs gated graph neural networks to enrich news representations, thereby fusing historical news representations by a historical news aggregator.",

    "translated_abstract": "精确地向用户推荐候选新闻文章一直是个性化新闻推荐系统的核心挑战。大多数近期的研究主要集中在使用先进的自然语言处理技术从丰富的文本数据中提取语义信息，使用从本地历史新闻派生的基于内容的方法。然而，这种方法缺乏全局视角，未能考虑用户隐藏的动机和行为，超越语义信息。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的模型 GLORY（Global-LOcal news Recommendation sYstem），它结合了从其他用户学到的全局表示和本地表示，来增强个性化推荐系统。我们通过构建一个全局感知历史新闻编码器来实现这一目标，其中包括一个全局新闻图，并使用门控图神经网络来丰富新闻表示，从而通过历史新闻聚合器融合历史新闻表示。",
