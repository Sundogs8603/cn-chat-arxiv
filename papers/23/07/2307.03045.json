    "abstract": "This paper introduces Track Mix, a personalized playlist generation system released in 2022 on the music streaming service Deezer. Track Mix automatically generates \"mix\" playlists inspired by initial music tracks, allowing users to discover music similar to their favorite content. To generate these mixes, we consider a Transformer model trained on millions of track sequences from user playlists. In light of the growing popularity of Transformers in recent years, we analyze the advantages, drawbacks, and technical challenges of using such a model for mix generation on the service, compared to a more traditional collaborative filtering approach. Since its release, Track Mix has been generating playlists for millions of users daily, enhancing their music discovery experience on Deezer.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了Track Mix，这是一个于2022年在音乐流媒体服务Deezer上推出的个性化歌单生成系统。Track Mix通过自动为用户生成以初始音乐曲目为灵感的“混合”播放列表，让用户可以发现与他们喜爱的内容相似的音乐。为了生成这些混合歌单，我们考虑了使用Transformer模型在用户播放列表的数百万个曲目序列上进行训练。鉴于近年来Transformers的日益流行，我们分析了与传统合作过滤方法相比，在服务中使用这种模型进行混合生成所带来的优势、不足和技术挑战。自推出以来，Track Mix每天为数百万用户生成歌单，在Deezer上提升了他们的音乐发现体验。",
