    "abstract": "The focus of this paper is on identifying the most effective selling strategy for pairs trading of stocks. In pairs trading, a long position is held in one stock while a short position is held in another. The goal is to determine the optimal time to sell the long position and repurchase the short position in order to close the pairs position. The paper presents an optimal pairs-trading selling rule with trading constraints. In particular, the underlying stock prices evolve according to a two dimensional geometric Brownian motion and the trading permission process is given in terms of a two-state {trading allowed, trading not allowed} Markov chain. It is shown that the optimal policy can be determined by a threshold curve which is obtained by solving the associated HJB equations (quasi-variational inequalities). A closed form solution is obtained. A verification theorem is provided. Numerical experiments are also reported to demonstrate the optimal policies and value functions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文的重点是确定股票对交易中最有效的卖出策略。在股票对交易中，一只股票持有多头仓位，而另一只股票持有空头仓位。目标是确定最佳时机卖出多头仓位并回购空头仓位以平仓。本文提出了一种带有交易约束的最优股票对交易卖出规则。具体而言，基础股票价格按照二维几何布朗运动演化，而交易权限过程通过二态{允许交易，不允许交易}的马尔可夫链给出。研究表明，最优策略可以通过求解相关的HJB方程（拟变分不等式）得到的一个阈值曲线来确定。获得了一个闭合形式的解。提供了一个验证定理。还报告了数值实验来展示最优策略和价值函数。",
