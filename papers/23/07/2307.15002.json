    "abstract": "The effectiveness of compression distance in KNN-based text classification ('gzip') has recently garnered lots of attention. In this note, we show that similar or better effectiveness can be achieved with simpler means, and text compression may not be necessary. Indeed, we find that a simple 'bag-of-words' matching can achieve similar or better accuracy, and is more efficient.",
