    "translated_abstract": "互联网不仅数字化了信息，还使全球范围内的信息获取变得民主化。这种逐步但具有突破性的在线信息传播方式导致搜索引擎在塑造人类知识获取方面发挥越来越重要的作用。当互联网用户输入查询时，搜索引擎会对数百亿个可能的网页进行排序以确定要显示的内容。谷歌在搜索引擎市场占据主导地位，在过去十年中，谷歌搜索在全球范围内的市场份额超过80％。只有在俄罗斯和中国，竞争对手们在市场份额方面超过了谷歌，大约60％的俄罗斯互联网用户更喜欢使用Yandex（而不是Google），截至2022年，80％以上的中国互联网用户使用Baidu。尽管在互联网搜索提供商方面存在长期的地区差异，但有限的研究显示了这些提供商在传播国家赞助信息方面的比较情况。",
