    "abstract": "We propose an unsupervised, corpus-independent method to extract keywords from a single text. It is based on the spatial distribution of words and the response of this distribution to a random permutation of words. As compared to existing methods (such as e.g. YAKE) our method has three advantages. First, it is significantly more effective at extracting keywords from long texts. Second, it allows inference of two types of keywords: local and global. Third, it uncovers basic themes in texts. Additionally, our method is language-independent and applies to short texts. The results are obtained via human annotators with previous knowledge of texts from our database of classical literary works (the agreement between annotators is from moderate to substantial). Our results are supported via human-independent arguments based on the average length of extracted content words and on the average number of nouns in extracted words. We discuss relations of keywords with higher-order textual feature",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种无监督、与语料库无关的方法来从单一文本中提取关键词。它基于单词的空间分布及其对单词的随机排列的响应。与现有方法（如YAKE等）相比，我们的方法具有三个优点。首先，它在从长文本中提取关键词方面更加有效。其次，它能够推断出两种类型的关键词：局部和全局。第三，它揭示了文本的基本主题。此外，我们的方法与语言无关，适用于短文本。结果通过我们的古典文学作品数据库的具备先前知识的人类注释者获得（注释者之间的一致性从中等到重大）。我们的结果得到了基于提取内容词的平均长度和提取词中名词的平均数量的无人参与论证的支持。我们讨论了关键词与高阶文本特征的关系。",
