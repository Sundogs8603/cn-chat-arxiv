    "translated_abstract": "尽管最近在通过差分隐私（DP）增强联邦学习（FL）的隐私方面取得了进展，但在真实世界的医学场景中，DP在隐私保护和性能之间的权衡仍未充分探索。在本文中，我们提出在客户端级DP的背景下优化这种权衡，重点关注通信过程中的隐私。然而，医学成像的FL通常涉及的参与者（医院）比其他领域（如移动设备）少得多，因此确保客户端具有差分隐私更具挑战性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种自适应中介策略，以提高性能而不损害隐私。具体来说，我们在理论上发现将客户端分为子客户端，作为医院和服务器之间的中介，可以减轻DP引入的噪音而不损害隐私。我们提出的方法在使用两个公共数据集进行分类和分割任务的实证评估中得到了验证。",
