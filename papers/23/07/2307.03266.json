    "translated_abstract": "大多数医学图像分割的最先进技术依赖于深度学习模型。然而，这些模型通常在狭义任务上以监督的方式进行训练，需要昂贵的标记数据集。最近，在自然语言生成等多个机器学习领域取得的进展已经证明了构建基础模型的可行性和实用性，这些模型可以在几乎没有标记数据的情况下为各种不同的下游任务定制。这可能代表了医学成像的范式转变，我们预计基础模型可能塑造该领域的未来。本文考虑了一个最近开发的应用于医学图像分割的基础模型UniverSeg。我们在前列腺成像的背景下进行了经验评估研究，并将其与传统的训练任务特定分割模型的方法进行了比较。我们的结果和讨论突出了几个重要因素，这些因素在基础模型开发中可能非常重要。",
