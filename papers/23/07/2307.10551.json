    "translated_abstract": "关键信息提取（KIE）是一个具有挑战性的多模态任务，旨在从视觉丰富的文档中提取结构化的语义实体值。尽管已经取得了显著进展，但仍存在两个需要解决的主要挑战。首先，现有数据集的布局相对固定，并在语义实体类别数量上有限，导致这些数据集与复杂的现实场景之间存在显著差距。其次，现有方法采用两阶段的流水线策略，可能导致错误传播问题。此外，它们在新出现的语义实体类别出现的情况下很难应用。为了解决第一个挑战，我们提出了一个名为复杂布局表单的新的大规模人工注释数据集（CLEX），其中包含5,860个图像和1,162个语义实体类别。为了解决第二个挑战，我们引入了并行指针网络（PPN），它是一个端到端的解决方案。",
