    "abstract": "This paper investigates causal influences between agents linked by a social graph and interacting over time. In particular, the work examines the dynamics of social learning models and distributed decision-making protocols, and derives expressions that reveal the causal relations between pairs of agents and explain the flow of influence over the network. The results turn out to be dependent on the graph topology and the level of information that each agent has about the inference problem they are trying to solve. Using these conclusions, the paper proposes an algorithm to rank the overall influence between agents to discover highly influential agents. It also provides a method to learn the necessary model parameters from raw observational data. The results and the proposed algorithm are illustrated by considering both synthetic data and real Twitter data.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了相互连接且经过时间交互的代理之间的因果影响。具体而言，本论文考察了社交学习模型和分布式决策协议的动态，并推导出了表明代理之间因果关系并解释网络上影响流动的表达式。结果表明，这些因果关系取决于图的拓扑结构和每个代理对于他们试图解决的推理问题的信息水平。基于这些结论，本文提出了一种算法来评估代理之间的整体影响力，以发现高度有影响力的代理。还提供了一种从原始观测数据中学习必要的模型参数的方法。结果和所提出的算法通过考虑合成数据和真实的Twitter数据加以说明。",
