    "translated_abstract": "类似于公司基本面的区块链网络的链上数据（指标）提供了对网络的重要和全面的见解。尽管具有信息性质，但链上数据尚未在基于强化学习的加密货币投资组合管理系统中得到利用。一个有趣的课题是，与基准相比，链上数据的利用程度能够提高强化学习系统的回报表现。因此，在本研究中，我们提出了CryptoRLPM，这是一种新颖的基于强化学习的系统，将链上数据纳入端到端的加密货币投资组合管理。CryptoRLPM由五个单元组成，从信息理解到交易订单执行。在CryptoRLPM中，链上数据经过测试和指定，以解决指标无效性的问题。此外，CryptoRLPM的可扩展性使得可以随时更改投资组合中的加密货币。在三个投资组合上的回测结果表明，CryptoRLPM的表现优于所有基准。",
