    "abstract": "The field of trajectory forecasting has grown significantly in recent years, partially owing to the release of numerous large-scale, real-world human trajectory datasets for autonomous vehicles (AVs) and pedestrian motion tracking. While such datasets have been a boon for the community, they each use custom and unique data formats and APIs, making it cumbersome for researchers to train and evaluate methods across multiple datasets. To remedy this, we present trajdata: a unified interface to multiple human trajectory datasets. At its core, trajdata provides a simple, uniform, and efficient representation and API for trajectory and map data. As a demonstration of its capabilities, in this work we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing trajectory datasets, providing users with a rich understanding of the data underpinning much of current pedestrian and AV motion forecasting research, and proposing suggestions for future datasets from these insights. trajdata is permissiv",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，由于自动驾驶车辆（AVs）和行人运动跟踪的大规模真实世界人类轨迹数据集的发布，轨迹预测领域取得了显著发展。尽管这些数据集对社区来说是一个福音，但它们都使用自定义和独特的数据格式和API，使得研究人员难以在多个数据集上训练和评估方法。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了trajdata：多个人类轨迹数据集的统一接口。trajdata提供了一个简单、统一和高效的轨迹和地图数据的表示和API。本文通过实证评估现有的轨迹数据集，展示了trajdata的能力，使用户对当前行人和AV运动预测研究的数据有了深入理解，并提出了未来数据集的建议。",
