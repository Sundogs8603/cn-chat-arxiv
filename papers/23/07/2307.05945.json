    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了YOGA，一种基于深度学习的轻量级目标检测模型，可以在低端边缘设备上运行，同时仍然实现竞争性的准确性。YOGA架构由一个两阶段特征学习流水线和一个廉价线性变换组成，只使用常规卷积神经网络所需卷积滤波器数量的一半来学习特征图。此外，它使用注意机制在其颈部进行多尺度特征融合，而不是常规检测器使用的朴素连接。YOGA是一种灵活的模型，可以轻松地按数量级缩放，以适应各种硬件约束。我们在COCO-val和COCO-testdev数据集上与其他10多个最先进的目标检测器评估了YOGA。结果表明，YOGA在模型大小和准确性之间取得了最佳平衡（AP增加了22％，参数和FLOP减少了23-34％），这使它成为部署的理想选择。",
