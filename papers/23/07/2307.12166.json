    "translated_abstract": "基于人工智能的大型语言模型（LLM）具有革新教育、研究和实践的巨大潜力。然而，区分人类写作和AI生成的文本已经成为一项重要任务。本文介绍了一项比较研究，提出了一个新颖的数据集，包含不同体裁的人类写作和LLM生成的文本：论文、故事、诗歌和Python代码。我们采用了几种机器学习模型来对这些文本进行分类。结果表明，尽管数据集的样本数量有限，这些模型在区分人类和AI生成的文本方面表现出了很高的效力。然而，当分类GPT生成的文本时，任务变得更具挑战性，特别是在故事写作方面。结果表明，与更复杂的多类别任务相比，这些模型在二元分类任务（如区分人类生成文本和特定LLM）方面表现出了更优越的性能。",
