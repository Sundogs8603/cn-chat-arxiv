    "abstract": "Arctic sea ice has steadily diminished as atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have increased. Using observed data from 1979 to 2019, we estimate a close contemporaneous linear relationship between Arctic sea ice area and cumulative carbon dioxide emissions. For comparison, we provide analogous regression estimates using simulated data from global climate models (drawn from the CMIP5 and CMIP6 model comparison exercises). The carbon sensitivity of Arctic sea ice area is considerably stronger in the observed data than in the climate models. Thus, for a given future emissions path, an ice-free Arctic is likely to occur much earlier than the climate models project. Furthermore, little progress has been made in recent global climate modeling (from CMIP5 to CMIP6) to more accurately match the observed carbon-climate response of Arctic sea ice.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着大气温室气体浓度的增加，北极海冰不断减少。利用1979年至2019年的观测数据，我们估计北极海冰面积与累积二氧化碳排放之间存在紧密的线性关系。为了比较，我们提供了使用全球气候模型（从CMIP5和CMIP6模型比较实验中提取的模拟数据）进行类似回归估计的结果。从观测数据来看，北极海冰面积对碳排放的敏感性比气候模型要强得多。因此，对于给定的未来排放路径，北极无冰期可能比气候模型预测的要早得多。此外，从CMIP5到CMIP6的最近全球气候模拟中，很少取得更准确地匹配北极海冰碳气候响应的进展。",
