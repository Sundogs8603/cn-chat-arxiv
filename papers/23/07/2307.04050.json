    "translated_abstract": "负载规划问题是快递运营中服务网络设计的一个关键挑战：它决定了在终端之间如何在时间上分配多少辆拖车（或负载）进行派遣。另一个关键挑战是确定一个流程计划，它指定了如何将包裹体积分配给计划的负载。本文考虑到了动态负载规划问题（DLPP），它同时考虑了负载和流程规划的挑战，以在操作日之前随着需求预测的变化而调整负载和流程。本文旨在开发一个决策支持工具，为网络中各个终端的规划人员提供决策支持。本文将DLPP形式化为一个MIP，并证明它在每个商品都可以通过主路径和备用路径进行路由的网络中有大量的对称性。因此，优化求解器可能会对密切相关的问题返回根本不同的解决方案，使规划人员感到困惑，降低对优化求解的信任度。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an optimization-based learning approach for the load planning problem in parcel carriers, considering challenges in load and flow planning. A decision-support tool is developed to assist planners in making informed decisions. The study reveals the presence of symmetries in the network, causing varying solutions from optimization solvers and reducing trust in the optimization process."
