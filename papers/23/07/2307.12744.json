    "translated_abstract": "市场相关性的分析对于相关资产的最优投资组合选择至关重要，但其记忆效应经常被忽略。本文分析了S&P500的市场平均相关性，它对应于主要市场模式的原始成分分析。我们将广义Langevin方程拟合到数据中，其记忆核意味着市场相关性至少回溯到三个交易周存在显著的记忆效应。与没有记忆的模型相比，记忆核提高了GLE的预测准确性，因此，在进行最优投资组合选择以最小化风险或预测未来相关性时必须考虑这种记忆效应。此外，贝叶斯恢复估计进一步证明了数据中的非马尔可夫性，并表明存在一个比观察到的每日市场数据慢得多的隐藏慢时间尺度操作。假设这样一个慢时间尺度存在后，我们的预测方法通过将Langevin模型中引入的慢时间尺度的效果总结了分析结果。",
