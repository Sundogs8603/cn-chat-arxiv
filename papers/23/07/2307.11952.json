    "translated_abstract": "生存结局评估在癌症中具有挑战性，并与多种临床因素（如成像和基因组生物标志物）密切相关。实现多模态分析有望揭示患者结局的新的预测模式。在本研究中，我们提出了一种多模态变压器（PathOmics），将病理学和基因组洞察力整合到结肠相关癌症生存预测中。我们强调无监督预训练，以捕获吉比像素全切片图像（WSIs）和各种基因组数据（如mRNA序列、拷贝数变异和甲基化）之间的内在相互作用。在预训练中进行多模态知识聚合后，我们的任务特定模型微调可以扩展适用于多模态和单模态数据（如仅图像或基因组）的数据可用性范围。我们在TCGA结肠和直肠癌队列上评估了我们的方法，结果显示所提出的方法具有竞争力并且优于其他方法。",
