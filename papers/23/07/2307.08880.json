    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于深度学习的应用取得了很大的成功。文本、音频、图像和视频都已经通过深度学习方法进行了探索，并且取得了显著的成果。特别是在计算机视觉领域，卷积神经网络（CNN）的应用产生了可靠的结果。然而，为了取得这些结果，需要大量的数据。然而，数据集并不总是可以获取的。此外，对数据进行注释可能会很困难且耗时。自我训练是一种半监督的方法，成功地缓解了这个问题，并达到了最先进的性能。理论分析甚至证明，它可能导致比普通分类器更好的泛化表现。神经网络可能面临的另一个问题是现代问题的复杂性不断增加，需要高计算和存储成本。一种缓解这个问题的方法是采用模块化学习，这是受到人类认知启发的策略。该方法的原理是将应用拆分为多个模块，每个模块负责处理特定的部分。每个模块可以被单独训练和更新，从而降低了整个系统的复杂性。",
