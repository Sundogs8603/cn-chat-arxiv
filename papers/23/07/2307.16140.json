    "translated_abstract": "深度模型在单图像超分辨率任务中取得了显著的进展，特别是使用了大卷积核（$3\\times3$或更大）的大型模型。然而，这些模型的高计算复杂度限制了其在实时、资源受限的环境中的部署。相反，$1\\times1$卷积具有较高的计算效率，但在聚合局部空间表示方面表现不佳，这是SISR模型的一个重要能力。为了解决这种对立，我们提出了融合$3\\times3$和$1\\times1$卷积核优点的轻量级SISR网络，名为Shift-Conv-based Network (SCNet)。通过引入一个无参数的空间平移操作，在保持计算效率的同时，赋予了全卷积轻量级网络强大的表示能力。大量实验证明了网络的有效性。",
