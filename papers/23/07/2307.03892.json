    "abstract": "Our paper investigates the use of discourse embedding techniques to develop a community recommendation system that focuses on mental health support groups on social media. Social media platforms provide a means for users to anonymously connect with communities that cater to their specific interests. However, with the vast number of online communities available, users may face difficulties in identifying relevant groups to address their mental health concerns. To address this challenge, we explore the integration of discourse information from various subreddit communities using embedding techniques to develop an effective recommendation system. Our approach involves the use of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to enhance the performance of the recommendation system. Our findings indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the use of each technique separately and provides interpretability in the recommendation process.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们的论文研究了使用话语嵌入技术来开发一个社区推荐系统，重点关注社交媒体上的心理健康支持群体。社交媒体平台为用户提供了与满足其特定兴趣的社区匿名连接的方式。然而，由于在线社区数量庞大，用户可能难以找到相关群组来解决他们的心理健康问题。为了解决这个挑战，我们使用嵌入技术探索来自不同subreddit社区的话语信息的整合，以开发一个有效的推荐系统。我们的方法使用基于内容和协同过滤的技术来提升推荐系统的性能。我们的研究结果表明，所提出的方法优于单独使用每种技术，并提供了推荐过程的可解释性。",
