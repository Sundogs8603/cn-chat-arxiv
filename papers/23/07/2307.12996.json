    "abstract": "Deep learning in computational biochemistry has traditionally focused on molecular graphs neural representations; however, recent advances in language models highlight how much scientific knowledge is encoded in text. To bridge these two modalities, we investigate how molecular property information can be transferred from natural language to graph representations. We study property prediction performance gains after using contrastive learning to align neural graph representations with representations of textual descriptions of their characteristics. We implement neural relevance scoring strategies to improve text retrieval, introduce a novel chemically-valid molecular graph augmentation strategy inspired by organic reactions, and demonstrate improved performance on downstream MoleculeNet property classification tasks. We achieve a +4.26% AUROC gain versus models pre-trained on the graph modality alone, and a +1.54% gain compared to recently proposed molecular graph/text contrastively t",

    "translated_abstract": "在计算生物化学中，深度学习传统上专注于分子图神经表征；然而，最近语言模型的进展突显了文本中所编码的科学知识量。为了弥合这两种模态，我们研究了如何将分子属性信息从自然语言转化为图表征。我们研究了在使用对比学习将神经图表征与其特征的文本描述表征对齐后，属性预测性能的提升。我们实现了神经相关性评分策略以改进文本检索，引入了一种受有机反应启发的新颖合法分子图扩增策略，并在下游的MoleculeNet属性分类任务上展示了性能的改善。与仅在图模态上预训练的模型相比，我们取得了+4.26%的AUROC增益，并与最近提出的分子图/文本对比模型相比，取得了+1.54%的增益。",
