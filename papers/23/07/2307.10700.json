    "abstract": "There has been a steep recent increase in the number of large language model (LLM) papers, producing a dramatic shift in the scientific landscape which remains largely undocumented through bibliometric analysis. Here, we analyze 388K papers posted on the CS and Stat arXivs, focusing on changes in publication patterns in 2023 vs. 2018-2022. We analyze how the proportion of LLM papers is increasing; the LLM-related topics receiving the most attention; the authors writing LLM papers; how authors' research topics correlate with their backgrounds; the factors distinguishing highly cited LLM papers; and the patterns of international collaboration. We show that LLM research increasingly focuses on societal impacts: there has been an 18x increase in the proportion of LLM-related papers on the Computers and Society sub-arXiv, and authors newly publishing on LLMs are more likely to focus on applications and societal impacts than more experienced authors. LLM research is also shaped by social dyn",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型的论文数量近年来呈急剧增加，这种变化对科学领域产生了戏剧性的影响，但目前还没有进行详细的文献计量分析。本文分析了CS和Stat arXiv上发布的388K篇论文，并重点关注2023年与2018-2022年之间发表模式的变化。我们分析了LLM论文的比例增加情况，得到了最多关注的与LLM相关的主题，撰写LLM论文的作者，作者的研究主题与背景的相关性，区分高被引用LLM论文的因素，以及国际合作的模式。我们展示了LLM研究越来越关注社会影响：在计算机与社会子arXiv上，与LLM相关的论文比例增加了18倍，新发表关于LLM的作者更倾向于关注应用和社会影响。LLM研究也受到社会动态的影响。",
    "tldr": "大型语言模型的论文数量急剧增加，研究重点逐渐转向社会影响。与LLM相关的论文呈现持续增长的趋势，新发表关于LLM的作者更注重应用和社会影响。"
