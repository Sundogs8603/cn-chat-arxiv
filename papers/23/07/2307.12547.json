    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了带有图论约束的背包问题。也就是说，我们假设背包项目集上存在一个图结构，并且解决方案还需要满足背包约束之上的某些图论性质。特别是，在连通背包问题中，我们需要计算一个连通的项目子集，其价值最大，且满足背包约束的大小。我们证明了即使对于最大度为四的图，这个问题也是强NP完全的，对于星形图，这个问题也是NP完全的。另一方面，我们开发了一个运行时间为$O\\left(2^{tw\\log tw}\\cdot\\text{poly}(\\min\\{s^2,d^2\\})\\right)$的算法，在其中$tw,s,d$分别是图的树宽度，背包的大小和目标值。我们进一步展示了一个$(1-\\epsilon)$近似算法，其运行时间为$O\\left(2^{tw\\log tw}\\cdot\\text{poly}(n,1/\\epsilon)\\right)$，对于每个$\\epsilon>0$都成立。我们还展示了对几个其他图论性质的类似结果。",
