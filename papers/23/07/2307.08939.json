    "translated_abstract": "自适应巡航控制（ACC）是一种广泛应用的驾驶员辅助功能，用于保持期望速度和与前方车辆的安全距离。本文评估基于深度神经网络（DNN）的ACC系统在隐蔽感知攻击下的安全性，该攻击会对摄像机数据进行有针对性的扰动，以导致前方碰撞事故。我们提出了一种基于知识和数据驱动的方法，设计了一种上下文感知策略，用于选择触发攻击最关键的时间点，并采用了一种新颖的基于优化的方法，在运行时生成适应性图像扰动。我们使用实际驾驶数据集和逼真的仿真平台评估了所提出攻击的有效性，该仿真平台使用了来自生产ACC系统的控制软件和物理世界驾驶模拟器，并考虑了驾驶员的干预以及自动紧急制动（AEB）和前向碰撞警示（FCW）等安全功能。",
