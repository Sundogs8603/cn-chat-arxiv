    "abstract": "Ribozymes, RNA molecules with distinct 3D structures and catalytic activity, have widespread applications in synthetic biology and therapeutics. However, relatively little research has focused on leveraging deep learning to enhance our understanding of ribozymes. This study implements Word2Vec, an unsupervised learning technique for natural language processing, to learn ribozyme embeddings. Ribo2Vec was trained on over 9,000 diverse ribozymes, learning to map sequences to 128 and 256-dimensional vector spaces. Using Ribo2Vec, sequence embeddings for five classes of ribozymes (hatchet, pistol, hairpin, hovlinc, and twister sister) were calculated. Principal component analysis demonstrated the ability of these embeddings to distinguish between ribozyme classes. Furthermore, a simple SVM classifier trained on ribozyme embeddings showed promising results in accurately classifying ribozyme types.
