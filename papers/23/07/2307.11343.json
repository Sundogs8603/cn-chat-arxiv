    "translated_abstract": "Chat-GPT的出现引发了对于具有身体的人工智能的兴趣激增。然而，许多现有的具有身体的人工智能模型严重依赖于与训练环境的大量交互，这在实际环境中可能不可行。为此，Maniskill2引入了一个完整的物理模拟基准，用于操作各种3D对象。该基准使得代理可以使用不同的演示数据集进行训练，并评估他们在测试环境中适应未见场景的能力。本文提出了一种新颖的两阶段微调策略，旨在基于Maniskill2基准进一步提升我们模型的泛化能力。通过大量实验证明了我们方法的有效性，并在ManiSkill2挑战赛的三个赛道中获得第一名。我们的研究结果突出了我们方法提高具有身体的人工智能模型泛化能力的潜力，并为它们的实际应用铺平了道路。",
