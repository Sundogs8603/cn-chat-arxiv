    "translated_abstract": "算法公正性一直是机器学习社区关注的重点。本文针对二分排名场景，即实例来源于正类或负类，目标是学习一个排名函数，使得正实例排名高于负实例。虽然公平性和性能之间可能存在权衡，但我们提出了一个模型不可知的后处理框架 xOrder，用于实现二分排名的公平性并保持算法分类性能。具体而言，我们通过动态规划过程优化一个加权效用的和，以确定不同受保护组之间最佳弯曲路径。xOrder兼容各种分类模型和排名公平性指标，包括监督和无监督的公平性指标。除了二元组之外，xOrder还可以应用于多个受保护组。我们评估了我们提出的算法的性能，并与其他方法进行了比较。实验结果表明，xOrder在维持分类性能的同时实现了较好的公平性。",
