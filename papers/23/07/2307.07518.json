    "abstract": "Large-scale multimodal language models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable success in general domains. However, the exploration of diagnostic language models based on multimodal cephalometric medical data remains limited. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal cephalometric analysis and diagnostic dialogue model. Firstly, a multimodal orthodontic medical dataset is constructed, comprising cephalometric images and doctor-patient dialogue data, with automatic analysis of cephalometric landmarks using U-net and generation of diagnostic reports. Then, the cephalometric dataset and generated diagnostic reports are separately fine-tuned on Minigpt-4 and VisualGLM. Results demonstrate that the CephGPT-4 model exhibits excellent performance and has the potential to revolutionize orthodontic measurement and diagnostic applications. These innovations hold revolutionary application potential in the field of orthodontics.",

    "translated_abstract": "大规模多模态语言模型在一般领域取得了显著的成功。然而，在基于多模态颅颌医学数据的诊断语言模型的探索仍然有限。本文提出了一种新颖的多模态颅颌分析和诊断对话模型。首先，构建了多模态正畸医学数据集，包括颅颌影像和医患对话数据，并使用U-net自动分析颅颌标志点和生成诊断报告。然后，将颅颌数据集和生成的诊断报告分别在Minigpt-4和VisualGLM上进行微调。结果表明，CephGPT-4模型表现出优异的性能，并具有颠覆正畸测量和诊断应用的潜力。这些创新在正畸学领域具有革命性的应用潜力。",
