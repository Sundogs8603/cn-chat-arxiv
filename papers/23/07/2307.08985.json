    "abstract": "Text-to-image generation model is able to generate images across a diverse range of subjects and styles based on a single prompt. Recent works have proposed a variety of interaction methods that help users understand the capabilities of models and utilize them. However, how to support users to efficiently explore the model's capability and to create effective prompts are still open-ended research questions. In this paper, we present PromptCrafter, a novel mixed-initiative system that allows step-by-step crafting of text-to-image prompt. Through the iterative process, users can efficiently explore the model's capability, and clarify their intent. PromptCrafter also supports users to refine prompts by answering various responses to clarifying questions generated by a Large Language Model. Lastly, users can revert to a desired step by reviewing the work history. In this workshop paper, we discuss the design process of PromptCrafter and our plans for follow-up studies.",

    "translated_abstract": "文本到图像生成模型能够根据单个提示生成各种主题和风格的图像。最近的研究提出了各种交互方法，帮助用户了解模型的能力并利用它们。然而，如何支持用户高效地探索模型的能力并创建有效的提示仍然是一个开放性的研究问题。在本文中，我们提出了PromptCrafter，一个新颖的混合倡议系统，可以逐步创建文本到图像提示。通过迭代的过程，用户可以高效地探索模型的能力并明确自己的意图。PromptCrafter还通过回答由大型语言模型生成的澄清问题的各种回答来支持用户优化提示。最后，用户可以通过查看工作历史来恢复到所需的步骤。在本研讨会论文中，我们讨论了PromptCrafter的设计过程和后续研究计划。",
