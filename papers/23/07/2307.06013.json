    "translated_abstract": "实体对齐旨在寻找不同知识图谱之间的等价实体对，这对于推动知识融合至关重要。随着时态知识图谱的广泛使用，时间感知实体对齐方法出现以增强对齐效果。现有的时间感知实体对齐模型基于图神经网络（GNN），取得了最先进的性能，但由于GNN的可扩展性问题，很难将其应用到大规模时态知识图谱中。因此，本文提出了一个有效且高效的非神经网络实体对齐框架LightTEA，它由四个关键组件组成：(1)两方面三视图标签传播，(2)带有时态约束的稀疏相似度，(3)Sinkhorn算子，以及(4)时态迭代学习。所有这些模块共同作用，提高了实体对齐的性能，同时减少了模型的时间开销。在公共数据集上的广泛实验证明，我们提出的模型明显优于最先进的方法。",
