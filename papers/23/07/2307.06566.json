    "translated_abstract": "船只方向角预测是一项重要的图像处理任务，通常依赖于深度卷积神经网络（CNN）进行准确预测。本文提出了一种新颖的框架，可以减小船只方向角预测模型的尺寸和计算成本，同时不影响预测准确性。首先，基于MobileNetV2设计了一个名为Mobile-SOAP的新型船只方向角预测模型，实现了最新的预测准确性。然后，通过将Mobile-SOAP中的卷积块替换为四个小规模网络，创建了四个微型SOAP模型。接下来，为了将知识从Mobile-SOAP传递到四个轻量级模型中，我们提出了一种新颖的知识蒸馏框架SOAP-KD，包括基于特征的引导损失和优化的基于合成样本的知识传递机制。最后，在FGSC-23数据集上进行了大量实验，证实了Mobile-SOAP在现有模型上的优越性。",
