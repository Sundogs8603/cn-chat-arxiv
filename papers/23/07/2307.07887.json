    "translated_abstract": "在分析扫描文档时，手写文本可能覆盖打印文本。这在文档的光学字符识别（OCR）和数字化过程中造成困难，并且进而影响到下游的自然语言处理（NLP）任务。之前的研究要么仅关注手写文本的二分类，要么进行三类文档的分割，即手写、打印和背景像素的识别。这导致手写和打印重叠的像素只被分配到一个类别中，因此在另一个类别中不被考虑。因此，在这项研究中，我们开发了新的方法来解决手写和打印文本分割的挑战，目标是完整地恢复不同类别的文本，特别是提高重叠部分的分割性能。为了促进这项任务，我们介绍了一个新的数据集SignaTR6K，该数据集收集自真实的法律文件。",
