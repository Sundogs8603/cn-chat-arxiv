    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种简化的PaDiM（通过实例建模进行像素级异常检测）方法，用于图像中的异常检测，通过将从骨干卷积神经网络（CNN）提取的特征向量拟合为单个多元高斯（MVG）分布，并使用它们的马哈拉诺比斯距离作为异常得分。我们在这个框架中引入了一个中间步骤，通过对特征向量应用白化变换，能够生成能够可视化解释MVG所学到的特征的热图。我们在MVTec-AD数据集上评估了提出的技术，并结果显示了视觉模型验证的重要性，为这个框架中的一些在其他情况下看不见的问题提供了洞见。本文生成的可视化结果可以在https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7937978上公开获取。",
