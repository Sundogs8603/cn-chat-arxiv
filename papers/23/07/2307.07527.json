    "translated_abstract": "自主车辆 (AVs) 通过代替人工驾驶员而采用先进的计算机辅助决策系统，成为一种有前景的解决方案。然而，为了能够有效地驾驶道路，AVs 必须具备类似人类驾驶员的预测驾驶能力，即预测周围交通参与者的未来行为。在自动驾驶的背景下，借鉴现有文献对轨迹预测方法进行综合评估是推进该领域和发展全面理解的关键。为了满足这一需求，我们进行了一项综合调查，重点关注AVs的轨迹预测方法，特别是深度学习和强化学习为基础的机器学习技术。我们广泛研究了与AVs轨迹预测相关的两百余项研究。本文首先介绍了车辆轨迹预测的一般问题，并提供了一系列方法来解决这个问题。接着我们讨论了目前存在的挑战，并提出了未来研究的方向。",
