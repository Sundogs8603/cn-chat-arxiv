    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出利用基于生成神经网络的变分自编码器进行信道估计。变分自编码器以一种新颖的方式将真实但未知的信道分布建模为条件高斯分布。所得到的信道估计器利用变分自编码器的内部结构对来自条件高斯信道模型的均方误差最优估计器进行参数化逼近。我们提供了严格的分析，以确定什么条件下基于变分自编码器的估计器是均方误差最优的。然后，我们提出了使基于变分自编码器的估计器实用的考虑因素，并提出了三种不同的估计器变体，它们在训练和评估阶段对信道知识的获取方式不同。特别地，仅基于噪声导频观测进行训练的所提出的估计器变体非常值得注意，因为它不需要获取信道训练。",
