    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究显示了基于边缘计算的道路异常检测系统，该系统可以同时进行数据收集。然而，边缘计算机的数据存储空间很小，但我们需要长时间存储收集到的音频样本，以便更新现有模型或开发新的方法。因此，我们应该考虑一种在保持高保真音频的同时进行高效存储管理的方法。从硬件角度来看，使用低分辨率麦克风可以直观地减小文件大小，但不推荐这种方法，因为它会从根本上削弱高频组件。另一方面，计算文件压缩方法可以将收集到的高分辨率音频编码为紧凑的代码，因此推荐使用该方法，因为它还提供相应的解码方法。受此启发，我们提出了一种简单而有效的基于预训练自编码器的数据压缩方法。",
