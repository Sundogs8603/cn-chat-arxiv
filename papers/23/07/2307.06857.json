    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach for improving the quality and consistency of generated outputs from large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs). Self-consistency has emerged as an effective approach for prompts with fixed answers, selecting the answer with the highest number of votes. In this paper, we introduce a generalized framework for self-consistency that extends its applicability beyond problems that have fixed-answer answers. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our approach consistently recovers the optimal or near-optimal generation from a set of candidates. We also propose lightweight parameter-free similarity functions that show significant and consistent improvements across code generation, autoformalization, and summarization tasks, even without access to token log probabilities. Our method incurs minimal computational overhead, requiring no auxiliary reranker models or modifications to the existing model.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们提出了一种改进大规模预训练语言模型生成输出的质量和一致性的新方法。自洽性已经被证明是一种有效的方法，对于具有固定答案的提示，选择得票最多的答案。我们引入了一个推广的自洽性框架，扩展了其适用性，超越了固定答案问题的范围。通过大量的模拟实验，我们证明了我们的方法能够从候选集中恢复最优或接近最优的生成结果。我们还提出了一种轻量级无参数相似性函数，即使没有访问到标记的概率，也能在代码生成、自动形式化和摘要任务中显著和一致地改进效果。我们的方法几乎没有计算开销，不需要额外的再排序模型或对现有模型的修改。",
