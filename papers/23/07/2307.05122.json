    "translated_abstract": "当政策变量超出先前政策支持范围时，反事实预测是具有挑战性的。然而，在许多情况下，关于感兴趣政策的信息可以从不同的“源”地区得到，这些地区已经实施了类似的政策。在本论文中，我们提出了一种新的方法，利用来自源地区的数据来预测目标地区的新政策。我们不依赖于使用参数化规范的结构关系的外推，而是制定一个可转移条件，并构建一个合成的结果-政策关系，使其尽可能接近满足条件。合成关系考虑了可观测数据和结构关系的相似性。我们开发了一个通用过程来构建反事实预测的渐进置信区间，并证明了其渐进有效性。然后，我们将我们的提议应用于预测德克萨斯州青少年就业率。",
