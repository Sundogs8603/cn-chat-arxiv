To tackle the planning of general part assembly, we present General Part Assembly Transformer (GPAT), a transformer based model architecture that accurately predicts part poses by inferring how each part shape corresponds to the target shape.

    "translated_abstract": "自主机器人组装领域的大多数成功都局限于单个目标或者单一类别。我们提出研究通用零件组装，即使用未见过的零件形状创建新颖目标组装的任务。为了解决通用零件组装的规划问题，我们提出了通用零件组装Transformer（GPAT），这是一种基于Transformer模型的架构，通过推断每个零件形状如何对应目标形状，准确预测零件的姿态。我们在3D CAD模型和现实世界扫描数据上进行的实验表明，GPAT具有对新颖和多样化的目标和零件形状的泛化能力。",
