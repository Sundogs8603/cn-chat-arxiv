    "abstract": "We study the optimal method for rationing scarce resources through a queue system. The designer controls agents' entry into a queue and their exit, their service priority -- or queueing discipline -- as well as their information about queue priorities, while providing them with the incentive to join the queue and, importantly, to stay in the queue, when recommended by the designer. Under a mild condition, the optimal mechanism induces agents to enter up to a certain queue length and never removes any agents from the queue; serves them according to a first-come-first-served (FCFS) rule; and provides them with no information throughout the process beyond the recommendations they receive. FCFS is also necessary for optimality in a rich domain. We identify a novel role for queueing disciplines in regulating agents' beliefs and their dynamic incentives and uncover a hitherto unrecognized virtue of FCFS in this regard.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了通过队列系统对稀缺资源进行分配的最优方法。设计者控制代理进入队列和离开队列的方法，他们的服务优先级或排队纪律，以及他们对队列优先级的信息，并在设计者建议时提供他们加入队列的动机和重要性。在一个温和的条件下，最优机制使代理人进入到一个特定的队列长度，并且从不将任何代理人从队列中移除；按照先来先服务原则为他们服务；在整个过程中除了他们收到的建议之外，不提供任何信息。在丰富的领域中，先来先服务原则对于最优性也是必要的。我们发现了排队纪律在调节代理人信念和动态激励方面的新角色，并揭示了先来先服务在这方面的一个迄今未被认识到的优点。",
