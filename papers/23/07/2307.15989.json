    "translated_abstract": "光流和视差是自主驾驶感知中两个信息丰富的视觉特征。它们已广泛应用于各种应用，如障碍物和车道检测。\"U-V-Disparity\"的概念在文献中得到了广泛探讨，而光流的对应概念却受到了相对较少的关注。传统的运动分析算法通过匹配两个连续视频帧之间的对应点来估计光流，这限制了对环境信息和几何约束的充分利用。因此，我们提出了一种新的策略，在智能车辆的碰撞自由空间（也称为可通行区域或简称为自由空间）中建模光流，充分利用三维驾驶环境中的几何信息。我们提供了光流的明确表示，并推导出光流分量与垂直坐标之间的二次关系。通过对多个数据集进行广泛的实验。",
