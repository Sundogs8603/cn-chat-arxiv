    "abstract": "The rapid growth of air and space travel in recent years has resulted in an increased demand for legal regulation in the aviation and aerospace fields. This paper provides an overview of air and space law, including the topics of aircraft accident investigations, air traffic control, international borders and law, and the regulation of space activities. With the increasing complexity of air and space travel, it is important to understand the legal implications of these activities. This paper examines the various legal aspects of air and space law, including the roles of national governments, international organizations, and private entities. It also provides an overview of the legal frameworks that govern these activities and the implications of international law.
