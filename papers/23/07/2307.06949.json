    "translated_abstract": "个性化已经成为生成式人工智能领域中的一个重要方面，使得在不同背景和风格下合成个体成为可能，同时保持高保真度。然而，个性化过程在时间和内存需求方面存在困难。每个个性化模型的微调需要大量的GPU时间投入，为每个主题存储一个个性化模型会对存储容量提出要求。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出了HyperDreamBooth-一种能够从一个人的单张图片有效生成一组个性化权重的超网络。通过将这些权重组合到扩散模型中，并搭配快速微调，HyperDreamBooth能够以多种背景和风格生成一个人的面部，保持高主题细节同时也保持模型对多样化风格和语义修改的关键知识。我们的方法在大约50倍体现了面部个性化。",
