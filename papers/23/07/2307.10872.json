    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the task of detecting local episodes involving violation of the standard It\\^o semimartingale assumption for financial asset prices in real time that might induce arbitrage opportunities. Our proposed detectors, defined as stopping rules, are applied sequentially to continually incoming high-frequency data. We show that they are asymptotically exponentially distributed in the absence of Ito semimartingale violations. On the other hand, when a violation occurs, we can achieve immediate detection under infill asymptotics. A Monte Carlo study demonstrates that the asymptotic results provide a good approximation to the finite-sample behavior of the sequential detectors. An empirical application to S&P 500 index futures data corroborates the effectiveness of our detectors in swiftly identifying the emergence of an extreme return persistence episode in real time.",
