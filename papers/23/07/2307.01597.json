    "translated_title": "在高峰小时序列预测中缩小性能差距: Seq2Peak框架",
    "translated_abstract": "高峰小时序列预测（PHSF）是各个领域中一个重要但未被充分探索的任务。虽然最先进的深度学习模型在常规时间序列预测（TSF）中表现出色，但在PHSF中却难以达到可比较的结果。这可能归因于高峰小时序列中高度非平稳性的挑战，使得直接预测比标准的TSF更加困难。此外，手动从常规预测结果中提取最大值会导致性能不佳，因为模型会最小化平均差。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了Seq2Peak，一个专为PHSF任务而设计的新颖框架，以弥合在TSF模型中观察到的性能差距。Seq2Peak具有两个关键组件：CyclicNorm流程来减轻非平稳性问题，以及一个简单而有效的可训练参数自由峰值小时解码器，采用混合损失函数来利用原始序列和高峰小时序列作为监督信号。",
