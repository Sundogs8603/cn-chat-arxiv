    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个分类模型，根据案件在提交时可得到的信息,来预测印度下级法院的延迟。该模型建立在2010年提交的420万个法院案件及其在10年期间的结果的数据集上。数据集来自印度的7000多个下级法院。作者采用AutoML开发了一个多类别分类模型，覆盖了所有等待期，并使用二进制决策森林分类器提高了延迟分类的预测准确性。最佳模型的准确率达到81.4％，精确度、召回率和F1分别为0.81。研究证明了基于相关数据点（如辖区、法院、法官、主题和相关方）的AI模型在预测印度法院延迟方面的可行性。本文还讨论了相关文献的结果，并提出了改进和未来研究的方向。作者已提供数据集和Python代码文件。",
