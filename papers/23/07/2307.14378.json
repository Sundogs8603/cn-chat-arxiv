    "translated_abstract": "在实践中，经常需要通过表格以某种函数依赖的形式描述值的集合。由于某些情况，观察到的值存在误差。为了逼近，建议使用能够平滑观察结果误差的函数依赖。逼近能够确定观察表中未列出的函数的中间值。使用指数级数对数据进行逼近可以获得不亚于多项式逼近的结果。在经济科学文献中，幂函数形式的逼近，例如Cobb-Douglas函数，已经广泛应用。这种逼近的优点是逼近函数类型简单，缺点是并非所有过程都能以给定精度用幂函数来描述。一个例子是GDP指标。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种利用三角方法对数值序列进行平滑处理的方法，并以匈牙利GDP数据为例进行了研究。通过指数级数的逼近，可以有效减小观察结果的误差，并得到不亚于多项式逼近的结果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method for smoothing numerical series using the triangle method and explores its application on Hungarian GDP data. By approximating the data with exponent series, it reduces the observation errors and achieves results comparable to polynomial approximation."
