    "translated_abstract": "在过去几年里，外科数据科学引起了机器学习（ML）社区的广泛关注。各种研究已经证明了新兴的ML技术在分析手术数据方面的有效性，特别是手术记录，用于数字化临床和非临床功能，如术前计划、上下文感知决策和手术技能评估。然而，这个领域仍处于初级阶段，缺乏代表性和有注释的数据集，以用于训练中间ML任务中的鲁棒模型。此外，现有数据集存在标签不准确的问题，阻碍了可靠模型的开发。在本文中，我们提出了一种系统的方法，利用有噪声的数据开发用于手术工具检测的鲁棒模型。我们的方法引入了两个关键创新：(1)智能主动学习策略，用于最小数据集的识别和人工专家的标签修正；(2)用于学生-教师模型组装的策略。",
