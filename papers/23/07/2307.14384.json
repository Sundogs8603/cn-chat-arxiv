Firstly, HPTI in the server constructs uniformly distributed and fixed class prototypes, and shares them with clients to match class statistics, further guiding consistent feature representation for local clients. Secondly, HPL in each client captures the hierarchical information in local data with the supervision of shared class prototypes in the hyperbolic model space. Additionally, CA in the server mi",

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）以分散化的方式协同对用户数据建模。然而，在现实世界中，客户端之间的非相同和独立数据分布（非IID）阻碍了FL的性能，原因有三点，即（1）类别统计的变化，（2）层级信息利用不足和（3）客户端聚合的不一致性。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了HyperFed，其中包含三个主要模块，即超球面原型Tammes初始化（HPTI），超球面原型学习（HPL）和一致聚合（CA）。首先，服务器中的HPTI构造均匀分布且固定的类别原型，并与客户端分享以匹配类别统计，进一步指导本地客户端的一致特征表示。其次，每个客户端中的HPL在超球面模型空间中以共享的类别原型为监督，捕获本地数据中的层级信息。此外，在服务器中的CA进行一致聚合。",
