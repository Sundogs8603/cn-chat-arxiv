    "translated_abstract": "Nyström方法是一种方便的启发式方法，以近线性的复杂度获得低秩逼近的核矩阵。现有的研究通常使用该方法对低或中等精度的正半定矩阵进行逼近。在这项工作中，我们提出了一系列启发式策略，使得Nyström方法能够对非对称和/或长宽比不同的矩阵实现高精度。所得到的方法（称为高精度Nyström方法）将Nyström方法和瘦秩显露分解进行了快速的枢轴策略，在渐进交替方向细化过程中实现了两种细化机制：从随机选择的少数列开始交替行和列枢轴，并自适应增加样本数量，直到达到所需的秩或精度。进一步提出了一种基于逐步采样Schur补的快速子集更新策略，以加速细化过程。",
