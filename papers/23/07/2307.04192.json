    "translated_abstract": "视频问答是视频理解领域的一项基础任务。尽管当前的视觉-语言模型(VLMs)配备了视频变换器(Video Transformers)，实现了时间建模并取得了优秀的结果，但代价是巨大的计算能力，因此在实时应用场景中过于昂贵。一种经济的解决方法是只对视频的一小部分帧进行采样，来代表视频的主要内容，并在这些采样帧上调整图像-文本模型。最近的视频理解模型通常随机采样一组帧或片段，而不考虑它们的内部关联性和与问题的相关性。我们认为这种无目标的采样可能会遗漏可以推导出正确答案的关键帧，在采样稀疏程度增加时，情况会变得更糟，而随着视频长度的增加，采样稀疏程度也会增加。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了两种帧采样策略，分别是",
