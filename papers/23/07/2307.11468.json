    "abstract": "The vision of the upcoming 6G technologies, characterized by ultra-dense network, low latency, and fast data rate is to support Pervasive AI (PAI) using zero-touch solutions enabling self-X (e.g., self-configuration, self-monitoring, and self-healing) services. However, the research on 6G is still in its infancy, and only the first steps have been taken to conceptualize its design, investigate its implementation, and plan for use cases. Toward this end, academia and industry communities have gradually shifted from theoretical studies of AI distribution to real-world deployment and standardization. Still, designing an end-to-end framework that systematizes the AI distribution by allowing easier access to the service using a third-party application assisted by a zero-touch service provisioning has not been well explored. In this context, we introduce a novel platform architecture to deploy a zero-touch PAI-as-a-Service (PAIaaS) in 6G networks supported by a blockchain-based smart system.",

    "translated_abstract": "未来6G技术的愿景是通过超密集网络、低延迟和快速数据传输来支持普适人工智能（PAI），并使用零接触解决方案实现自我X（例如，自配置、自监测和自愈）服务。然而，对于6G的研究仍处于初级阶段，目前只完成了对其设计的概念化、实施的调查和用例的规划的第一步。为此，学术界和工业界逐渐从AI分发的理论研究转向实际部署和标准化。然而，设计一种端到端的框架来通过允许第三方应用程序辅助的零接触服务配置更容易访问AI服务的分发尚未得到很好的研究。在这种背景下，我们引入了一种新颖的平台架构，在6G网络中使用基于区块链的智能系统支持部署零接触的PAI即服务。",
