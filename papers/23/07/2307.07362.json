Multimodal deep learning (MDL), which involves the integration of multiple sources of data, such as images and text, has the potential to revolutionize the analysis and interpretation of biomedical data.

To this end, there is a critical need to conduct a systematic review on this topic, identify the limitations of current work, and explore future directions. In this scoping review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of the field and identify key concepts, types of studies, and research gaps with a focus on biomedical images and texts joint learning, mainly because these two were the most commonly available data types in MDL research. This study reviewed the current uses of multimodal deep learning on five tasks: (1) Report generation, (2) Visual question answering, (3) Cros",

    "translated_abstract": "未来的计算辅助诊断和预后系统应该能够同时处理多模态数据。多模态深度学习（MDL）涉及多种数据源（如图像和文本）的整合，有潜力彻底改变生物医学数据的分析和解释。然而，这一领域直到最近才引起研究人员的注意。因此，有必要对这个主题进行系统综述，确定当前工作的局限性，并探索未来的方向。在这篇综述中，我们旨在提供对该领域 current state 的全面概述，并重点关注生物医学图像和文本的联合学习，主要是因为这两种数据类型在 MDL 研究中最常用。本研究回顾了多模态深度学习在五个任务中的当前应用：（1）报告生成，（2）视觉问答，（3）交叉...",
