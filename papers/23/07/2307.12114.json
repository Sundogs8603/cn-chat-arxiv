    "abstract": "We evaluate four state-of-the-art instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) -- ChatGPT, Flan-T5 UL2, Tk-Instruct, and Alpaca -- on a set of 13 real-world clinical and biomedical natural language processing (NLP) tasks in English, such as named-entity recognition (NER), question-answering (QA), relation extraction (RE), etc. Our overall results demonstrate that the evaluated LLMs begin to approach performance of state-of-the-art models in zero- and few-shot scenarios for most tasks, and particularly well for the QA task, even though they have never seen examples from these tasks before. However, we observed that the classification and RE tasks perform below what can be achieved with a specifically trained model for the medical field, such as PubMedBERT. Finally, we noted that no LLM outperforms all the others on all the studied tasks, with some models being better suited for certain tasks than others.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们评估了四种最先进的指导细调大型语言模型（LLM）——ChatGPT、Flan-T5 UL2、Tk-Instruct和Alpaca——在13个实际世界的临床和生物医学自然语言处理（NLP）任务中的表现，例如命名实体识别（NER）、问答（QA）、关系抽取（RE）等。我们的综合结果表明，在大多数任务的零样本和少样本情况下，评估的LLM开始接近最先进模型的性能，尤其对于QA任务表现得特别好，即使它们之前没有见过这些任务的示例。然而，我们观察到分类和关系抽取任务的表现低于特定训练于医学领域的模型（如PubMedBERT）可以达到的水平。最后，我们注意到没有一个LLM在所有研究任务上都胜过其他模型，有些模型更适合于特定的任务。",
