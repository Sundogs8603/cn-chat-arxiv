    "translated_abstract": "用户点击后的转化预测对研究人员和开发者来说非常重要。最近的研究采用多任务学习来解决点击数据中的选择偏差和数据稀疏性问题，但是之前的工作主要集中在点对点学习上，标签的顺序（即点击和点击后）并没有得到很好的探索，这自然产生了一个列表学习问题。受到最近在可微排序方面的进展的启发，我们在本文中提出了一个新颖的多任务框架，利用用户行为的顺序来预测用户点击后的转化。具体而言，我们定义了一个聚合算子来将不同任务的预测输出合并为一个统一的分数，然后我们使用计算得到的分数通过可微排序来建模标签的关系。在公共和工业数据集上的广泛实验证明了我们提出的模型相对竞争对手的优越性。",
