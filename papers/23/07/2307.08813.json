    "translated_abstract": "理解蛋白质相互作用和通路知识对于揭示生物系统的复杂性和研究生物功能和复杂疾病的基本机制至关重要。尽管现有的数据库提供了来自文献和其他源的策划生物数据，但它们往往不完整且维护工作繁重，因此需要替代方法。在本研究中，我们提出利用大型语言模型的能力，通过自动从相关科学文献中提取这些知识来解决这些问题。为了实现这个目标，在这项工作中，我们调查了不同大型语言模型在识别蛋白质相互作用、通路和基因调控关系等任务中的有效性。我们对不同模型的性能进行了彻底评估，突出了重要的发现，并讨论了这种方法所面临的未来机遇和挑战。代码和数据集链接可在论文中找到。",
