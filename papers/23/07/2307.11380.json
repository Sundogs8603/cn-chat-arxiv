    "abstract": "The remarkable capabilities of large-scale language models, such as ChatGPT, in text generation have incited awe and spurred researchers to devise detectors to mitigate potential risks, including misinformation, phishing, and academic dishonesty. Despite this, most previous studies, including HC3, have been predominantly geared towards creating detectors that differentiate between purely ChatGPT-generated texts and human-authored texts. This approach, however, fails to work on discerning texts generated through human-machine collaboration, such as ChatGPT-polished texts. Addressing this gap, we introduce a novel dataset termed HPPT (ChatGPT-polished academic abstracts), facilitating the construction of more robust detectors.

    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型如ChatGPT在文本生成方面具有显著能力，这激发了研究人员开发检测器以减轻潜在风险，包括错误信息、网络钓鱼和学术不诚实。然而，大多数以前的研究主要针对区分纯粹由ChatGPT生成的文本和人工撰写的文本的检测器。然而，这种方法在区分通过人机协作生成的文本（例如ChatGPT润色的文本）上失效。为了填补这一空白，我们引入了一个新颖的数据集HPPT（ChatGPT润色的学术摘要），以构建更强大的检测器。该数据集与现有语料库不同，它包括人工撰写的文本和ChatGPT润色的摘要对，而不仅仅是ChatGPT生成的文本。此外，我们提出了“波兰比率”的方法，这是一种衡量ChatGPT在文本生成中参与程度的创新指标。",
