    "translated_abstract": "胃癌是全球肿瘤相关死亡的第三大原因，然而目前没有规范推荐的筛查测试方法。现有方法可能侵入性强、昂贵且对早期胃癌的敏感性不足。本研究探索了在非对比CT扫描中使用深度学习方法进行胃癌检测的可行性。我们提出了一种新颖的簇诱导蒙版变换器，以多任务方式同时分割肿瘤并分类异常。我们的模型结合了可学习的簇，用于编码胃癌的纹理和形状原型，并利用自注意和交叉注意与卷积特征交互。在实验中，所提出的方法在由100名癌症患者和148名正常人组成的保留测试集上达到了85.0%的敏感性和92.6%的特异性。相比之下，两名放射科医生的平均敏感性为73.5%，特异性为84.3%。",
