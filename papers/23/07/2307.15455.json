    "translated_abstract": "查询自动补全(QAC)旨在为给定的查询前缀提供合理的补全建议。传统的QAC系统利用历史查询日志中的Trie数据结构来提供最受欢迎的补全建议。然而，对于任何QAC系统来说，有两种特定的场景很难处理：短前缀(本质上存在歧义)和未见前缀。最近，提出了个性化自然语言生成(NLG)模型，利用前一个会话的查询作为上下文来解决这两个挑战。然而，这样的NLG模型存在两个缺点：(1)前述会话查询可能与当前前缀的用户意图无关且包含噪声；(2)NLG模型无法直接融合历史查询的流行度。因此，我们提出了一种新颖的QAC算法Trie-NLG，该算法同时利用Trie中的流行度信息和前一个会话查询中的个性化信息。",
