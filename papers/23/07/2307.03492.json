    "translated_abstract": "语义通信（SC）是一种新兴的智能范式，为元宇宙、混合现实和万物互联等未来应用提供解决方案。然而，在目前的SC系统中，知识库（KB）的构建面临着一些问题，包括知识表示有限、频繁的知识更新和不安全的知识共享。幸运的是，大型AI模型的发展提供了解决上述问题的新方案。在这里，我们提出了一种基于大型AI模型的SC框架（LAM-SC），专门用于图像数据，我们首先设计了基于段落模型（SAM）的知识库（SKB），它可以通过通用语义知识将原始图像划分为不同的语义段落。然后，我们提出了一种基于注意力的语义集成（ASI），通过权衡由SKB生成的语义段落，无需人工参与并将它们集成为具有语义感知的图像。此外，我们还提出了一种自适应语义压缩（ASC）方法。",
