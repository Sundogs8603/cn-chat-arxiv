    "abstract": "The misuse of law by women in India is a serious issue that has been receiving increased attention in recent years. In India, women are often discriminated against and are not provided with equal rights and opportunities, leading to a gender bias in many aspects of life. This gender bias is further exacerbated by the misuse of law by women. There are numerous instances of women using the law to their advantage, often at the expense of men. This practice is not only unethical but also unconstitutional. The Indian Constitution does not explicitly guarantee gender equality. However, several amendments have been made to the Constitution to ensure that women are treated equally in accordance with the law. The protection of women from all forms of discrimination is considered a fundamental right. Despite this, women continue to be discriminated against in various spheres of life, including marriage, education, employment and other areas. The misuse of law by women in India is primarily seen ",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，印度妇女滥用法律已成为一个严重问题，并引起了越来越多的关注。在印度，妇女经常受到歧视，没有得到平等的权利和机会，导致了许多方面的性别偏见。妇女滥用法律进一步加剧了这种性别偏见。有许多妇女利用法律来谋求自己的利益，往往以牺牲男性的利益为代价。这种行为不仅不道德，而且违宪。印度宪法并没有明确保障性别平等。然而，已对宪法进行了几次修正，以确保妇女在法律上得到平等对待。保护妇女免受一切形式的歧视被认为是一项基本权利。尽管如此，妇女在婚姻、教育、就业和其他领域仍然受到歧视。",
