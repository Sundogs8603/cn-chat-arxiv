    "translated_abstract": "在没有任何标签的图像集中，我们的目标是训练一个模型，将每个图像映射到一个特征空间中的一个点，使得不仅接近性表示视觉相似度，而且位置直接编码了图像在数据集中的典型性。我们的关键见解是在双曲空间而不是欧几里德空间中进行无监督特征学习，其中点之间的距离仍然反映图像的相似度，但我们在位置上增加了表示典型性的能力：它离原点越近，就越典型。后一属性仅仅是从优化通常的度量学习目标中得到的：与许多训练实例相似的图像最好放置在欧几里德空间中相应点的中心位置，但在双曲空间中更靠近原点。我们提出了一种在双曲空间中利用球体密集编码（sphere pACKing）的无监督特征学习算法。",
