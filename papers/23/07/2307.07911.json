    "translated_abstract": "本文受在线广告拍卖中的出价推荐启发，考虑了一类具有两个主要特征的多层次和多智能体博弈：一个是大量的匿名智能体，另一个是竞争和合作之间复杂的相互作用。为了模拟这种复杂系统，我们提出了一种新颖且可操作的双目标优化方法，称为MESOB（Mean-field Equilibria & Social Optimality Balancing），并提出了一种相关的职业度量优化（OMO）方法MESOB-OMO来解决它。MESOB-OMO能够基于MESOB中的竞争和合作的双目标获取近似帕累托有效的解，特别是允许渐近地选择纳什均衡和社会均衡化。我们将MESOB-OMO应用于模拟的按点击付费广告拍卖的出价推荐。实验证明了其在平衡不同利益方面的效果。",
