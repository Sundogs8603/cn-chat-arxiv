    "abstract": "Extracting workflow nets from textual descriptions can be used to simplify guidelines or formalize textual descriptions of formal processes like business processes and algorithms. The task of manually extracting processes, however, requires domain expertise and effort. While automatic process model extraction is desirable, annotating texts with formalized process models is expensive. Therefore, there are only a few machine-learning-based extraction approaches. Rule-based approaches, in turn, require domain specificity to work well and can rarely distinguish relevant and irrelevant information in textual descriptions. In this paper, we present GUIDO, a hybrid approach to the process model extraction task that first, classifies sentences regarding their relevance to the process model, using a BERT-based sentence classifier, and second, extracts a process model from the sentences classified as relevant, using dependency parsing. The presented approach achieves significantly better results",

    "translated_abstract": "从文本描述中提取工作流网络可用于简化指南或形式化的业务流程和算法等正式流程的文本描述。然而，手动提取流程的任务需要领域专业知识和工作量。虽然自动流程模型提取是可取的，但用形式化的流程模型注释文本是昂贵的。因此，目前只有少数基于机器学习的提取方法。而基于规则的方法往往需要领域特定性才能良好运作，并且很少能够区分文本描述中的相关和不相关信息。本文提出了GUIDO，一种混合方法，用于处理流程模型提取任务。首先，使用基于BERT的句子分类器对句子进行相关性分类，然后使用依赖解析从被分类为相关的句子中提取流程模型。所提出的方法取得了显著改进的结果。",
