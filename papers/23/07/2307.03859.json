    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一个用于在长篇医疗文档上进行证据/理由提取的数据集，该数据集是在极端多标签分类任务上进行的。其中一个任务是计算机辅助编码（CAC），近年来由于机器学习技术的进步，CAC取得了显著的改进。然而，仅仅预测患者就诊的一组最终代码是不够的，因为CAC系统需要提供支持的文本证据来证明计费代码的合理性。能够为每个代码产生准确可靠的支持证据的模型将有巨大的好处。然而，创建人工注释的代码证据语料库非常困难，因为它需要专业知识。在本文中，我们介绍了MDACE，这是第一个公开可用的代码证据数据集，它是基于MIMIC-III临床记录的一个子集构建的。该数据集由专业医疗编码人员进行了注释，包含302份住院病历的3,934个证据片段和52份费用病历的5,563个证据片段。",
