    "translated_abstract": "两个随机变量的协方差衡量它们相对于各自均值的联合偏差的平均值。我们通过用其他统计函数（如分位数、期望量、或阈值）替代均值来推广这个众所周知的度量。这些函数的偏差通过广义误差定义，通常由识别或矩函数引发。作为一种归一化的依赖度量，我们构造了广义相关性。通过用一种新颖的Fr\\'echet-Hoeffding归一化替代常见的Cauchy-Schwarz归一化，我们获得了对于任何给定边缘分布，整个区间$[-1, 1]$的可达性。我们发现了这些新的依赖度量的有利特性。分位数和阈值相关性的家族产生了函数值分布相关性，显示了整个依赖结构。它们导致了尾部相关性，这可能应该取代尾部依赖系数。最后，我们构造了摘要协方差（corre）",
