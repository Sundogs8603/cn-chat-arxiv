    "abstract": "The impact of text length on the estimation of lexical diversity has captured the attention of the scientific community for more than a century. Numerous indices have been proposed, and many studies have been conducted to evaluate them, but the problem remains. This methodological review provides a critical analysis not only of the most commonly used indices in language learning studies, but also of the length problem itself, as well as of the methodology for evaluating the proposed solutions. The analysis of three datasets of English language-learners' texts revealed that indices that reduce all texts to the same length using a probabilistic or an algorithmic approach solve the length dependency problem; however, all these indices failed to address the second problem, which is their sensitivity to the parameter that determines the length to which the texts are reduced. The paper concludes with recommendations for optimizing lexical diversity analysis.",

    "translated_abstract": "关于文本长度对词汇多样性估计的影响已经引起科学界的长期关注。虽然已经提出了许多指数，并进行了许多研究来评估它们，但问题仍然存在。本方法学综述不仅对语言学习研究中最常用的指数进行了批判性分析，还对长度问题本身以及评估所提出解决方案的方法进行了分析。对三组英语学习者文本的分析结果表明，将所有文本使用概率或算法方法缩减为相同长度的指数可以解决长度依赖问题；然而，所有这些指数都未解决第二个问题，即它们对决定缩减文本长度的参数的敏感性问题。论文最后给出了优化词汇多样性分析的建议。",
