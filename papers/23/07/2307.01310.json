    "translated_abstract": "最近在命名实体识别（NER）方面取得了显著进展，提高了文本数据中实体的识别能力。然而，口述NER作为口述文档检索的专门领域，由于研究有限和数据稀缺而滞后。此外，口述NER中的跨语言迁移学习仍未被探索。本文利用荷兰语、英语和德语之间的迁移学习，使用管道和端到端（E2E）方案。我们利用自定义的伪标注数据集使用Wav2Vec2-XLS-R模型，并研究了几种适应跨语言系统的架构。我们的结果表明，端到端口述NER在我们有限的标注数据上优于基于管道的替代方案。值得注意的是，从德语到荷兰语的迁移学习超过了荷兰语E2E系统7%和荷兰语管道系统4%。这项研究不仅突出了口述NER中迁移学习的可行性，而且为未来的评估提供了有希望的结果。",
