    "translated_abstract": "为了解决现有方法的两个缺点，（i）几乎所有模型都依赖于高清地图，然而地图信息在实际交通场景中并不总是可用的，而且建立高清地图也是昂贵且耗时的；（ii）现有模型通常注重提高预测准确性，而忽视了计算效率，然而效率对于各种实际应用非常关键。本文提出了一种高效的轨迹预测模型，不依赖于交通地图。我们模型的核心思想是在第一阶段中对单个代理的时空信息进行编码，并在第二阶段中探索多个代理的时空交互。通过综合运用注意力机制、LSTM、图卷积网络和时序转换器等技术，我们的模型能够学习到所有代理的丰富动态和交互信息。与现有的无地图方法相比，我们的模型在性能上达到了最高水平。",
