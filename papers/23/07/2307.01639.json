    "translated_abstract": "互连性是衡量两种观点相似性的指标。尽管该概念来自哲学，但它在广泛的技术中至关重要，例如Wahl-O-Mat系统。在德国，该系统帮助选民找到最符合他们政治偏好的候选人。由于要迭代遍历观点的所有子集，准确计算互连性非常耗时。而且，对于每个子集，必须解决一个SAT模型计数问题的实例，这在计算机科学中被认为是一个硬问题。本研究是加速这种计算的第一项研究。我们将所谓的确认值的分布建模为三个高斯混合，并提出了有效的启发式算法来估计其模型参数。然后，通过分布的期望值来近似互连性。其中一些算法是全多项式时间的，其他算法只需要解决少量的SA模型实例。",
