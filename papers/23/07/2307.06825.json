    "translated_abstract": "领域泛化(DG)是指学习能够很好地推广到与训练领域相关但不同的新领域的模型。它是机器学习中的一个基本问题，并在最近几年引起了很多关注。已提出了大量不同的方法。不同的方法从不同的角度出发，使得很难对这个领域有一个整体的理解。在本文中，我们提出了一个用于领域泛化的因果框架，并在框架中对常见的DG方法进行了理解。我们的工作为以下问题提供了新的观点：(1)每个DG方法背后的关键思想是什么？(2)理论上为什么期望它改善对新领域的推广能力？(3)不同的DG方法之间如何相关，有什么相对优势和局限性？通过提供对DG的统一视角，我们希望能帮助研究者更好地理解其中的原则并开发出更有效的方法。",
