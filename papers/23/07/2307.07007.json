    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体的流行使政治家们使用它进行政治广告。因此，社交媒体上充满了选举激励（选举宣传），特别是在选举活动期间。选举管理机构无法追踪符合选举法规定的激励信息的传播和数量。本文解决了一个关键问题，同时揭示了迄今为止尚未有效针对的一个利基。因此，我们提供了第一个用于检测波兰语选举激励的公开数据集。其中包含6,112条人工标注的带有四种法律约束类别标签的推文。我们实现了0.66的评注者一致性（Cohen's kappa分值）。另一位评注者解决了前两位评注者之间的不匹配，提高了标注流程的一致性和复杂性。新创建的数据集被用于优化一个名为HerBERT的波兰语言模型（达到68%的F1分数）。我们还提出了一些潜在的应用案例。",
