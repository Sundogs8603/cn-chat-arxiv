    "abstract": "To realize the potential benefits and mitigate potential risks of AI, it is necessary to develop a framework of governance that conforms to ethics and fundamental human values. Although several organizations have issued guidelines and ethical frameworks for trustworthy AI, without a mediating governance structure, these ethical principles will not translate into practice. In this paper, we propose a multilevel governance approach that involves three groups of interdependent stakeholders: governments, corporations, and citizens. We examine their interrelationships through dimensions of trust, such as competence, integrity, and benevolence. The levels of governance combined with the dimensions of trust in AI provide practical insights that can be used to further enhance user experiences and inform public policy related to AI.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了实现人工智能的潜在益处并减轻可能的风险，有必要开发一个符合伦理和基本人类价值观的治理框架。尽管一些组织已经发布了可信AI的指南和伦理框架，但如果没有一个调节的治理结构，这些伦理原则将无法转化为实践。在本文中，我们提出了一个多层级治理方法，涉及三个相互依赖的利益相关者群体：政府、企业和公民。我们通过信任的维度（如能力、诚信和善意）来研究它们之间的相互关系。结合AI的治理水平和信任维度，提供了可用于进一步增强用户体验并为与AI相关的公共政策提供信息的实用见解。",
