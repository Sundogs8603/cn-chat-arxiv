    "abstract": "In the realm of data classification, broad learning system (BLS) has proven to be a potent tool that utilizes a layer-by-layer feed-forward neural network. It consists of feature learning and enhancement segments, working together to extract intricate features from input data. The traditional BLS treats all samples as equally significant, which makes it less robust and less effective for real-world datasets with noises and outliers. To address this issue, we propose the fuzzy BLS (F-BLS) model, which assigns a fuzzy membership value to each training point to reduce the influence of noises and outliers. In assigning the membership value, the F-BLS model solely considers the distance from samples to the class center in the original feature space without incorporating the extent of non-belongingness to a class. We further propose a novel BLS based on intuitionistic fuzzy theory (IF-BLS). The proposed IF-BLS utilizes intuitionistic fuzzy numbers based on fuzzy membership and non-membership",

    "translated_abstract": "在数据分类领域，广泛学习系统（BLS）已被证明是一种有效的工具，它利用逐层前馈神经网络。它包括特征学习和增强部分，共同从输入数据中提取复杂的特征。传统的BLS将所有样本视为同等重要，这使得它在处理带有噪声和异常值的真实数据集时不够稳健和有效。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了模糊BLS（F-BLS）模型，它为每个训练点分配模糊隶属度，以减小噪声和异常值的影响。在分配隶属度的过程中，F-BLS模型仅考虑样本到类别中心之间的距离，而不考虑不属于类别的程度。我们进一步提出了一种基于直觉模糊理论的新型BLS（IF-BLS）。所提出的IF-BLS利用基于模糊隶属度和非隶属度的直觉模糊数。",
