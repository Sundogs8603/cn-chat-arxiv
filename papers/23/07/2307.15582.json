    "abstract": "This paper explores the application of machine learning techniques to predict where hedging occurs in peer-tutoring interactions. The study uses a naturalistic face-to-face dataset annotated for natural language turns, conversational strategies, tutoring strategies, and nonverbal behaviours. These elements are processed into a vector representation of the previous turns, which serves as input to several machine learning models. Results show that embedding layers, that capture the semantic information of the previous turns, significantly improves the model's performance. Additionally, the study provides insights into the importance of various features, such as interpersonal rapport and nonverbal behaviours, in predicting hedges by using Shapley values for feature explanation. We discover that the eye gaze of both the tutor and the tutee has a significant impact on hedge prediction. We further validate this observation through a follow-up ablation study.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了将机器学习技术应用于预测同行辅导中避免冒犯语出现的情况。研究使用了一个自然面对面的数据集，对自然语言的转换、对话策略、辅导策略和非言语行为进行了注释。这些元素被处理成先前转换的向量表示，作为输入给多个机器学习模型。结果表明，捕捉先前转换的语义信息的嵌入层显著提高了模型的性能。此外，该研究通过使用Shapley值进行特征解释，提供了有关各种特征（如人际关系和非言语行为）在预测避免冒犯语方面的重要性的深入洞察。我们发现导师和学员的目光注视对于避免冒犯语的预测有重要影响。我们通过后续的切割研究进一步验证了这一观察结果。",
