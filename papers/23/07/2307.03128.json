    "translated_abstract": "本文展示了如何利用次微分几何进行流形学习和曲面重建，通过将局部线性逼近的点云集合成低维子束。通过将局部主成分分析得到的局部逼近收集到一个秩为$k$的切觉子束上，其中$k<d$，我们称之为主要子束。这确定了$\\mathbb{R}^d$上的次微分度量。我们展示了在这个度量下的次微分测地线可以成功地应用于许多重要问题，例如：明确构造一个近似子流形$M$，在$\\mathbb{R}^k$中构造点云的表示，并计算考虑学习到的几何的观测值之间的距离。在切空间被准确估计的极限情况下，重建保证与真实子流形相等。通过模拟实验，我们展示了该框架在处理噪声数据时的稳健性。",

By combining local linear approximations of a point cloud to obtain lower dimensional subbundles, it solves several important problems using sub-Riemannian geodesics under the sub-Riemannian metric, and shows robustness when dealing with noisy data."
