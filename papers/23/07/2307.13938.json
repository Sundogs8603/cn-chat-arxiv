    "translated_abstract": "半监督语义分割是一项重要任务，利用标记和未标记数据减少标记训练样例的开销。然而，SSS算法的有效性受到充分利用未标记数据潜力的困难的限制。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种用于像素级对比学习的双级孪生结构网络（DSSN）。通过在低级图像空间和高级特征空间中使用强增强视图的像素级对比损失来对齐正对，我们设计的DSSN旨在最大化可用未标记数据的利用。此外，我们引入了一种新的类别感知伪标签选择策略，用于从弱到强的监督，解决了大多数现有方法不执行选择或为所有类别应用预定义阈值的限制。具体而言，我们的策略选择了每个类别弱视图的高置信度预测来生成伪标签。",
