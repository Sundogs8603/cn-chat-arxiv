    "translated_abstract": "连续时间事件序列在诸如医疗保健、金融、在线购物、社交网络等现实世界领域中发挥着重要作用。为了对这类数据进行建模，时间点过程模型（TPPs）已成为最自然和有竞争力的模型，在学术界和应用界都产生了重要影响。尽管近年来出现了许多强大的模型，但这些模型和未来的研究尝试之间缺乏一个中心基准。这种缺乏标准化的情况阻碍了研究人员和从业者对方法进行比较和结果的再现，可能会减慢该领域的进展。在本文中，我们提出了EasyTPP，这是第一个关于事件序列建模领域的研究资产（例如数据、模型、评估程序、文档）的集中存储库。我们的EasyTPP对此领域有几个独特的贡献：统一的使用现有数据集和添加新数据集的界面；广泛的评估程序，包括...",
