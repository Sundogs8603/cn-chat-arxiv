We consider the notable class of greedy bounded-treewidth sets (gbts) and a new, generalized variant, called weakly gbts (wgbts). Revisiting and building on the notion of derivation graphs, we define (weakly) cycle-free derivation graph sets ((w)cdgs) and employ elaborate proof-theoretic arguments to obtain that gbts and cdgs coincide, as do wgbts and wcdgs. These novel characterizations advance our analytic proof-theoretic understanding of existential rules and will likely be instrumental in practice.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文建立了一种非常表达性的存在规则集的替代特征化方法，这些规则集具有可判定的查询包含关系。我们考虑了一类显著的贪婪有界宽度集合(gbts)及其一种新的广义变种，称为弱gbts(wgbts)。通过重新审视和构建导出图的概念，我们定义了（弱）无回路导出图集合（(w)cdgs），并运用详细的证明论证方法得出结论：gbts和cdgs相等，wgbts和wcdgs也相等。这些新颖的特征化方法推动了对存在规则的分析证明论的理解，并有望在实践中发挥重要作用。",
