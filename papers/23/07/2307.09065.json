    "translated_abstract": "图卷积网络（GCNs）可以对图结构数据进行端到端学习。然而，许多方法假设给定图结构。当输入的图具有噪声或不可用时，一种方法是构建或学习一个潜在的图结构。这些方法通常固定整个图的节点度的选择，这是次优的。相反，我们提出了一种新颖的端到端可微分图生成器，该生成器建立图的拓扑结构，每个节点都选择其邻域和大小。我们的模块可以轻松集成到涉及图卷积操作的现有流程中，将预定或现有的邻接矩阵替换为作为整体目标的一部分进行学习和优化的邻接矩阵。因此，它适用于任何GCN。我们将我们的模块集成到轨迹预测、点云分类和节点分类的流程中，在广泛的数据集和GCN上相比其他结构学习方法，获得了更高的准确性。",
