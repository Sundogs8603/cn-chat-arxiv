    "translated_abstract": "帕金森病的一个显著症状是姿势反射的逐渐丧失，最终导致步态困难和平衡问题。识别与步态障碍相关的脑功能紊乱对于更好地理解帕金森病的运动进展以及推动更有效和个性化的治疗的发展可能是至关重要的。本文提出了一个可解释的、几何的、加权图注意力神经网络（xGW-GAT），用于识别预测帕金森病患者步态困难进展的功能网络。xGW-GAT在MDS统一帕金森病评分标准（MDS-UPDRS）上预测多类别的步态障碍。我们的计算和数据高效的模型将功能连接组表示为黎曼流形上的对称正定（SPD）矩阵，以明确编码整个连接组的成对交互作用，根据此我们可以学习出一个注意力掩码，以产生个体和群体级别的可解释性。",
