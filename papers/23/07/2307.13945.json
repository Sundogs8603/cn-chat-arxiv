    "translated_abstract": "随着精确控制在不同和未知环境中的需求增加，对电源供应组件的要求也相应增加，其中包括永磁同步电机（Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors, PMSMs）。为了推断系统中的未知部分，广泛使用机器学习技术，特别是高斯过程回归（Gaussian Process Regression, GPR），因为它具有灵活的连续系统建模能力和保证性能。为了实际实现，采用了分布式GPR来减轻高计算复杂性。然而，从控制的角度研究分布式GPR仍然是一个开放的问题。本文提出了一种基于Lyapunov稳定性理论的用于PMSMs的控制感知最优聚合策略。该策略仅利用后验均值，从而避免了与后验方差相关的计算密集性计算。",
