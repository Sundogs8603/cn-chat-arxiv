    "translated_abstract": "密集检索（DR）将查询和文档转化为密集向量表示，并在向量空间中测量查询与文档之间的相似性。DR的一个挑战是缺乏领域特定的训练数据。虽然DR模型可以通过迁移学习从大规模公共数据集（如MS MARCO）中学习，但证据表明，并非所有DR模型和领域都能同等受益于迁移学习。最近，一些研究人员转向使用大型语言模型（LLMs）来改进零样本和少样本的DR模型。然而，这些方法中采用的硬提示或人工编写的提示无法保证生成的弱查询的质量。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了用于增强DR的软提示调优（SPTAR）：对于每个任务，我们利用软提示调优在有限的真实数据上优化任务特定的软提示，然后用这些提示引导LLMs为未标记的文档标记弱查询，从而得到足够的弱文档-查询对来训练任务特定的模型。",
