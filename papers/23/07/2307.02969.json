DPM addresses two key challenges for finding accurate separators: identifying separators that are large gaps between clusters instead of small gaps within a cluster and, to efficiently spend the privacy budget, prioritising separators that split the data into large subparts. Using the differentially private Exponential Mechanism, DPM randomly chooses cluster separators with provably high utility: For a data set $D$, if there is a wide low-density separator in the central $60\\%$ quantile, DPM finds that",
