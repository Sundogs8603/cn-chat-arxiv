    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是一种通过在资源受限的客户端上本地训练参数的分布式方式，以解决数据隐私问题的范例，受到了广泛关注。然而，当联邦学习服务器的覆盖范围内并非所有客户端都注册到联邦学习网络时，联邦学习就不适用。为了弥补这种差距，本文提出了联合学习者推荐辅助的联邦客户端选择(LRef-FedCS)，以及通信和计算资源调度，和本地模型准确性优化(LMAO)方法。这些方法旨在最小化最坏情况下参与者所产生的成本，确保在分层物联网网络中联邦学习的长期公平性。利用Lyapunov优化技术，我们将原始问题重新转化为逐步联合优化问题(JOP)。随后，为了解决混合整数非凸JOP，我们分别和迭代地解决LRef-FedCS和LMAO。",
