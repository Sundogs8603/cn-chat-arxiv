    "abstract": "We study how the introduction of carbon taxes in a closed economy propagate in a credit portfolio and precisely describe how carbon taxes dynamics affect the firm value and credit risk measures. We adapt a stochastic multisectoral model to take into account carbon taxes on both sectoral firms' production and household's consumption. Taxes are calibrated on carbon prices, provided by the NGFS scenarios, as well as on sectoral households' consumption and firms' production, together with their related greenhouse gases emissions. For each sector, this yields the sensitivity of firms' production and households' consumption to carbon taxes and the relationships between sectors. Our model allows us to analyze the short-term effects of carbon taxes as opposed to standard Integrated Assessment Models, which are not only deterministic but also only capture long-term trends of climate transition policy. Finally, we use a Discounted Cash Flows methodology to compute firms' values which we then use",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了碳税在封闭经济中如何在信贷组合中传播，并准确描述了碳税动态如何影响公司价值和信贷风险度量。我们采用随机多部门模型来考虑碳税对部门公司生产和家庭消费的影响。税收根据NGFS情景提供的碳价格进行校准，以及部门家庭消费和公司生产以及其相关温室气体排放。对于每个部门，这产生了公司生产和家庭消费对碳税的敏感度以及部门之间的关系。我们的模型允许我们分析短期碳税的影响，与标准的整体评估模型相反，后者既是确定性的，又只能捕捉气候过渡政策的长期趋势。最后，我们使用折现现金流量法来计算公司的价值，然后用它来进行资产定价和信用风险评估。",
