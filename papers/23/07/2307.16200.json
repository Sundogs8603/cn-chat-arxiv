    "translated_abstract": "本文关注医学对话中的术语-状态对提取（MD-TSPE），这在诊断对话系统和电子医疗记录（EMR）的自动抄写中是必不可少的。在过去的几年中，MD-TSPE的研究引起了越来越多的关注，特别是在生成方法取得显著进展之后。然而，这些生成方法在一阶段输出整个由术语-状态对组成的序列时忽略了集成先前知识的需求，这需要更深入的理解来建模术语之间的关系和推断每个术语的状态。本文提出了一个知识增强的两阶段生成框架（KTGF）来解决上述挑战。通过使用任务特定的提示，我们采用单一模型以统一的生成形式完成MD-TSPE的两个阶段：首先生成所有的术语，然后生成每个生成的术语的状态。通过这种方式，可以更有效地学习术语之间的关系。",
