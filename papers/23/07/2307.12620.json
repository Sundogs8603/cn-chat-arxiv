    "translated_abstract": "通过在过去-现在时间程序中使用来自时间逻辑的语言结构，如有限轨迹上的时间平衡逻辑（TELf），可以为建模动态应用提供具有表达力的计算框架。本文研究了所谓的过去-现在句法子类，它由一组逻辑编程规则组成，其体引用过去，头引用现在。这种限制确保了过去与未来的独立性，在大多数动态领域中是成立的。我们将补全和循环公式的定义扩展到过去-现在公式的情况，从而通过使用LTLf表达式捕捉一组过去-现在时间程序的时间稳定模型。",

Additionally, the definitions of completion and loop formulas are extended to capture the temporal stable models of a set of past-present temporal programs using LTLf expressions."
