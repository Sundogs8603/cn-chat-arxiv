    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习已经成为一种从分散异构数据中学习的流行方法。由于分散客户端上标签稀缺，联邦半监督学习（FSSL）出现以从少量标记数据中训练模型。现有的FSSL方法假设客户端之间的标签数据独立且具有相同分布，并且在客户端内部标记和未标记数据之间具有一致的类别分布。本文研究了FSSL的更实际和具有挑战性的情况，即数据分布不仅在客户端之间不同，在客户端内部标记和未标记数据之间也不同。为了解决这个挑战，本文提出了一种带有双调节器的新型FSSL框架，FedDure。FedDure通过粗调节器（C-reg）和细调节器（F-reg）解除了以前的假设：C-reg通过跟踪标记数据分布的学习效果来规范本地模型的更新；F-reg学习一个适应性加权方案，以适应客户端内不同的数据分布。",
