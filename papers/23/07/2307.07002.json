    "translated_abstract": "最先进的模型在受控环境下表现良好，但面对带外分布的例子时往往表现出困难，因此带外分布检测成为NLP系统中关键的组成部分。本文着重强调了现有NLP领域带外分布检测方法的局限性。具体来说，我们评估了八种易于集成到现有NLP系统中且不需要额外带外数据或模型修改的带外分布检测方法。我们的贡献之一是提供了一个结构良好的研究环境，可以完全复现实验结果。此外，我们的分析表明现有的NLP任务中带外分布检测方法对于捕捉所有由不同类型分布转换特征的样本尚不够敏感。在领域背景转变和单词随机排列的情况下，测试情景尤其具有挑战性。这突显了未来需要开展更有效的工作来发展带外分布检测方法。",
