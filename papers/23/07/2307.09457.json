    "abstract": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been widely applied to medical imaging diagnosis, where bag labels are known and instance labels inside bags are unknown. Traditional MIL assumes that instances in each bag are independent samples from a given distribution. However, instances are often spatially or sequentially ordered, and one would expect similar diagnostic importance for neighboring instances. To address this, in this study, we propose a smooth attention deep MIL (SA-DMIL) model. Smoothness is achieved by the introduction of first and second order constraints on the latent function encoding the attention paid to each instance in a bag. The method is applied to the detection of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on head CT scans. The results show that this novel SA-DMIL: (a) achieves better performance than the non-smooth attention MIL at both scan (bag) and slice (instance) levels; (b) learns spatial dependencies between slices; and (c) outperforms current state-of-the-art MIL methods",

    "translated_abstract": "多示例学习（MIL）已广泛应用于医学成像诊断，在其中包袋标签已知且包袋内的实例标签未知。传统MIL假设每个包袋内的实例是来自给定分布的独立样本。然而，实例通常是空间上或顺序上有序的，并且人们会期望相邻实例具有相似的诊断重要性。为了解决这个问题，在本研究中，我们提出了一种光滑注意力深度MIL（SA-DMIL）模型。通过对编码对每个包袋中每个实例的注意力的潜在函数引入一阶和二阶约束来实现平滑性。该方法应用于头部CT扫描中颅内出血（ICH）的检测。结果表明，这种新颖的SA-DMIL模型：（a）在扫描（包袋）和切片（实例）层面上比非光滑注意力MIL模型实现了更好的性能；（b）学习了切片之间的空间依赖关系；并且（c）优于当前最先进的MIL方法。",
