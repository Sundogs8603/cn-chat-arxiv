    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们探索了如何利用Deep Q-Network (DQN)来提高多类分类算法的功能性。我们将使用来自Kaggle的基准数据集创建一个将DQN与现有有监督多类分类算法相结合的框架。本研究的发现将带来对如何使用深度强化学习策略来提高多类分类准确性的见解。这些策略已经在图像识别、自然语言处理和生物信息学等领域中得到了应用。本研究还侧重于预测公司的财务困境以及Deep Q-Network在多类分类中的广泛应用。识别可能遇到财务困境的企业是金融和风险管理领域中的重要任务。当企业面临严重挑战时，无法维持运营并履行财务责任，就被认为处于财务困境中。",
