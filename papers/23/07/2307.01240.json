    "translated_abstract": "在在线评估中，数学问题（MWPs）帮助测试学习者通过解释其中的语言信息来进行关键推理能力的测试。为了测试学习者的数学推理能力，有时会重新表述问题或更改原始MWP的主题设置。由于手动识别具有相似问题模型的MWPs很麻烦，因此我们在这项工作中提出了一个为MWP检索提供工具。我们提出了一种混合方法来检索具有相同问题模型的类似MWPs。在我们的工作中，问题模型是指要执行的操作序列以达到解决方案。我们证明了我们的工具对所述任务非常有用，并优于基于语义相似度的方法，后者无法捕捉MWPs的算术和逻辑顺序。可以在https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSQWP3chFIs找到该工具的演示。",
