    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在参数上应用不同离散和时间正则化的推断稀疏时间变化的马尔科夫随机场(MRF)问题。由于离散正则化的复杂性，解决这个问题的大多数方法依赖于所谓的最大似然估计(MLE)与放松正则化，既不能得到理想的统计性质，也不能适应现实场景中的尺度。在本文中，我们通过离开MLE的范式，转而求解一类具有精确、离散正则化的受限优化问题，以促进估计参数的稀疏性。尽管我们的公式具有非凸和离散的特点，但我们证明它可以高效且参数化地求解所有稀疏水平的时间变化MRF的解路径。更具体地说，我们证明所有稀疏水平的时间变化MRF的整个解路径可以在O(pT^3)的复杂度下得到，其中T是时间的数量",
