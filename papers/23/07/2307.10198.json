    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI), a cornerstone of 21st-century technology, has seen remarkable growth in China. In this paper, we examine China's AI development process, demonstrating that it is characterized by rapid learning and differentiation, surpassing the export-oriented growth propelled by Foreign Direct Investment seen in earlier Asian industrializers.  Our data indicates that China currently leads the USA in the volume of AI-related research papers. However, when we delve into the quality of these papers based on specific metrics, the USA retains a slight edge. Nevertheless, the pace and scale of China's AI development remain noteworthy.  We attribute China's accelerated AI progress to several factors, including global trends favoring open access to algorithms and research papers, contributions from China's broad diaspora and returnees, and relatively lax data protection policies.  In the vein of our research, we have developed a novel measure for gauging China's imitation of US",

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）是21世纪技术的基石，中国在这方面取得了显著的发展。本文研究了中国的AI发展过程，表明其特点是快速学习和差异化发展，超过了早期亚洲工业化国家依靠外国直接投资推动的出口导向型增长。我们的数据显示，中国目前在AI相关研究论文的数量方面领先于美国。然而，当我们根据具体指标深入研究这些论文的质量时，美国仍略占优势。尽管如此，中国的AI发展的速度和规模仍值得关注。我们将中国加速的AI进展归因于几个因素，包括全球趋势支持算法和研究论文的开放获取、中国广泛的侨民和回国人员的贡献，以及相对宽松的数据保护政策。 为了支持我们的研究，我们开发了一种衡量中国模仿美国的新方法。",
