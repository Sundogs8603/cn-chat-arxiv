    "translated_abstract": "隐私和公平性是负责任的人工智能(AI)和值得信赖的机器学习(ML)的两个重要支柱。每个目标在文献中都得到了独立研究，旨在减少实现它们所带来的效用损失。尽管学术界和工业界对此表现出了巨大兴趣，但仍迫切需要更深入的研究来揭示如何将这两个目标同时集成到ML模型中。与被广泛接受的权衡不同，即隐私-效用和公平-效用，隐私和公平性之间的相互关系尚未被很好地理解。虽然一些研究提出了两个目标函数之间的权衡，但也有其他研究表明在某些场景中这些函数是相互一致的。为了填补这一研究空白，我们对ML中的隐私和公平性进行了彻底的回顾，包括监督学习、无监督学习、半监督学习和强化学习。",
