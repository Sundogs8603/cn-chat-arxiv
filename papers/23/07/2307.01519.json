    "abstract": "Tailoring treatment for individual patients is crucial yet challenging in order to achieve optimal healthcare outcomes. Recent advances in reinforcement learning offer promising personalized treatment recommendations; however, they rely solely on current patient observations (vital signs, demographics) as the patient's state, which may not accurately represent the true health status of the patient. This limitation hampers policy learning and evaluation, ultimately limiting treatment effectiveness. In this study, we propose the Deep Attention Q-Network for personalized treatment recommendations, utilizing the Transformer architecture within a deep reinforcement learning framework to efficiently incorporate all past patient observations.

    "translated_abstract": "个性化治疗对于每个病患至关重要，但是在达到最佳的医疗效果方面也面临挑战。最近强化学习的进展为个性化治疗推荐提供了有希望的方法；但是，这些方法仅依靠当前病患的观察信息（生命体征、人口统计数据）作为病患的状态，可能无法准确地代表病患的真实健康状况。这种限制妨碍了策略学习和评估，最终限制了治疗效果。在本研究中，我们提出了深度注意力Q网络来进行个性化治疗推荐，利用Transformer架构在深度强化学习框架内，高效地整合了所有过去的病患观察信息。我们在实际的败血症和急性低血压病人群中评估了该模型，证明了其优于现有模型的优越性。我们的模型源代码可以在https://github.com/stevenmsm/RL-ICU-DAQN获得。",
