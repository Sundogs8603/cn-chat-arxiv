For example, in recommendation systems, the reward that the platform obtains from a user's engagement with a particular type of content depends not only on the inherent features of the specific content, but also on how the user's preferences have evolved as a result of interacting with other types of content on the platform. Our general model accounts for the different rate $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ at which the state evolves (e.g., how fast a user's preferences shift as a result of previous content consumption",

The model takes into account the different rates at which the state evolves and accurately evaluates the relationship between reward and system health."
