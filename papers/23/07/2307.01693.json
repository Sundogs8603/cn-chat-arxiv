    "translated_abstract": "虽然广泛认识到美国法律中存在种族偏见，但目前尚不清楚这种偏见在法律语言中的表现方式，即司法意见中是否存在时期或地区的差异。我们在大规模语料库中的隐性种族偏见测量方法的基础上，对1860年至2009年的600多万个美国联邦和州级法院案件进行了GloVe词向量估算。我们发现几乎所有地区和时期都存在明显的种族偏见，传统上与黑人相关的名字更与预分类的“不愉快”术语密切相关，而传统上与白人相关的名字更与预分类的“愉快”术语密切相关。我们还测试了1950年前的法律意见是否比1950年后的意见更具隐性种族偏见，以及南方州的意见是否比东北州的意见在种族偏见方面变化较小。我们并未发现1950年前的法律意见存在更高程度的偏见，也未发现南方州的意见比东北州的意见在种族偏见方面变化较小的证据。",
