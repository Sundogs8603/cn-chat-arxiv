    "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed a plethora of works that leverage the power of visualization (VIS) to interpret machine learning (ML) models. The corresponding research topic, VIS4ML, keeps growing at a fast pace. To better organize the enormous works and shed light on the developing trend of VIS4ML, we provide a systematic review of these works through this survey. Since data quality greatly impacts the performance of ML models, our survey focuses specifically on summarizing VIS4ML works from the data perspective. First, we categorize the common data handled by ML models into five types, explain the unique features of each type, and highlight the corresponding ML models that are good at learning from them. Second, from the large number of VIS4ML works, we tease out six tasks that operate on these types of data (i.e., data-centric tasks) at different stages of the ML pipeline to understand, diagnose, and refine ML models. Lastly, by studying the distribution of 143 surveyed papers across",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，出现了许多利用可视化来解释机器学习模型的工作。相应的研究主题VIS4ML正在快速发展。为了更好地组织这些作品并揭示VIS4ML的发展趋势，我们通过这项调查提供对这些作品的系统回顾。由于数据质量极大地影响了机器学习模型的性能，我们的调查专门从数据视角总结了VIS4ML的作品。首先，我们将ML模型处理的常见数据分为五类，解释了每类数据的独特特征，并突出显示擅长从中学习的ML模型。其次，从众多的VIS4ML作品中，我们总结出在ML流程的不同阶段操作这些数据类型（即以数据为中心的任务）的六个任务，以了解、诊断和改进ML模型。最后，通过研究143篇调查论文的分布，我们对VIS4ML研究的热点进行了分析。",
