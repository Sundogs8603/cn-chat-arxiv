    "translated_abstract": "使用智能手表进行非接触式支付越来越受欢迎，但该支付方式缺乏传统的生物识别安全措施，如面部或指纹识别。在2022年，Sturgess等人提出了一种名为WatchAuth的系统，用于通过向支付终端伸手的物理手势来认证智能手表支付。虽然有效，但该系统需要用户经历繁重的注册过程才能达到可接受的错误率。在本论文中，我们探索深度学习应用是否可以减少用户在智能手表支付认证系统中必须提供的手势数量。我们首先构建了一个超越当前最先进技术的深度学习认证系统，包括在目标用户提供有限手势的情况下。然后，我们开发了一个正则化的自编码器模型来生成用户特定的合成手势。我们证明在训练中使用这些手势可以改善系统的性能。",
