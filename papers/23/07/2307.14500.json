    "abstract": "This study introduces and empirically tests a novel predictive model for digital information engagement (IE) - the READ model, an acronym for the four pivotal attributes of engaging information: Representativeness, Ease-of-use, Affect, and Distribution. Conceptualized within the theoretical framework of Cumulative Prospect Theory, the model integrates key cognitive biases with computational linguistics and natural language processing to develop a multidimensional perspective on information engagement. A rigorous testing protocol was implemented, involving 50 randomly selected pairs of synonymous words (100 words in total) from the WordNet database. These words' engagement levels were evaluated through a large-scale online survey (n = 80,500) to derive empirical IE metrics. The READ attributes for each word were then computed and their predictive efficacy examined. The findings affirm the READ model's robustness, accurately predicting a word's IE level and distinguishing the more engagi",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究介绍并经过实证测试了一种新颖的数字信息参与（IE）的预测模型——READ模型，其代表了参与度高的信息的四个关键属性：代表性、易用性、情感和分布。在累积前景理论的理论框架下，该模型将关键的认知偏差与计算语言学和自然语言处理相结合，以发展出对信息参与的多维度视角。研究采用一个严格的测试协议，选取了WordNet数据库中的50对随机同义词（共100个词），通过大规模的在线调查（n = 80,500）评估了这些词的参与水平，得出了实证IE指标。然后对每个词的READ属性进行计算，并检查其预测效果。研究结果证实了READ模型的鲁棒性，准确预测了词的IE水平，并区分了更具吸引力的词汇。",
