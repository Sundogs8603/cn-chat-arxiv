    "translated_abstract": "尽管人们对GNN的发展兴趣高涨，但在基准数据集的同质化仍然是GNN研究面临的基本问题。GraphWorld是一个最近提出的解决方案，它使用随机块模型(SBM)生成多样的合成图，用于对任何GNN任务进行基准测试。尽管GraphWorld取得了成功，但随机块模型对GraphWorld能够创建的图结构种类施加了基本限制。在这项工作中，我们研究了两个额外的合成图生成器如何改进GraphWorld的评估；LFR是图聚类文献中一个成熟的模型，而CABAM是一个针对GNN基准测试量身定制的Barabasi-Albert模型的最新改进。通过整合这些生成器，我们在GraphWorld框架内显著扩展了图空间的覆盖范围，同时保持了真实网络中观察到的关键图属性。为了证明它们的有效性，我们生成了30万个图来对11个GNN模型进行节点分类任务的基准测试。",
