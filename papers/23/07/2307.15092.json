    "translated_abstract": "沉积计算（RC）首先用于时间信号处理，它是一个具有随机连接的循环神经网络。一旦初始化，连接强度将保持不变。这种简单的结构将RC转化为一个非线性动力系统，将低维输入映射到高维空间中。该模型的丰富动力学、线性可分性和记忆容量使得简单的线性读出能够为各种应用生成适当的响应。RC涵盖了远远超出机器学习范围的领域，因为已经证明复杂的动力学可以在各种物理硬件实现和生物设备中实现。这样可以提供更大的灵活性和更短的计算时间。此外，模型动力学触发的神经元响应也揭示了理解大脑机制的方法，这些机制也利用类似的动力学过程。虽然关于RC的文献非常庞大且碎片化，但我们在这里对RC的最新发展进行了统一的回顾。",
