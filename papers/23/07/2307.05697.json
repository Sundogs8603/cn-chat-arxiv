    "translated_abstract": "通过使司机与具有相似行程和时间安排的旅客共享汽车，拼车被期望在减少交通拥堵和污染方面发挥重要作用。为了在一组司机和潜在乘客中高效地找到成功的拼车匹配，设计了许多拼车匹配服务。然而，现在已经认识到除了简单的出行需求外，许多非货币方面和社会因素可能影响个人愿意共乘的意愿，这些因素很难预测。为了解决这个问题，在这项研究中，我们提出了GoTogether，这是一个拼车服务的推荐系统，它利用学习排序技术从用户的选择历史（即接受或拒绝共享乘车的类型）中自动推导出每个用户的个性化排序模型。然后，GoTogether构建推荐乘车列表以最大化匹配成功率。",
