    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a multidimensional statistical model of intraday electricity prices at the scale of the trading session, which allows all products to be simulated simultaneously. This model, based on Poisson measures and inspired by the Common Shock Poisson Model, reproduces the Samuelson effect (intensity and volatility increases as time to maturity decreases). It also reproduces the price correlation structure, highlighted here in the data, which decreases as two maturities move apart. This model has only three parameters that can be estimated using a moment method that we propose here. We demonstrate the usefulness of the model on a case of storage valuation by dynamic programming over a trading session.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了一种针对交易会话规模的日内电力价格多维统计模型，允许同时模拟所有产品。该模型基于泊松测度，受常规冲击泊松模型的启发，模拟出了塞缪尔森效应（强度和波动性随到期时间的减少而增加）。它还模拟了在数据中突出显示的价格相关结构，该结构随着两个到期时间的间隔增大而减小。该模型仅有三个参数，可以使用本文提出的矩法进行估计。我们通过在交易会话期间进行动态规划，演示了模型的有用性，并在储能估值案例中进行了验证。",
