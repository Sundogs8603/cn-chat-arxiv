    "abstract": "Incomplete utterance rewriting has recently raised wide attention. However, previous works do not consider the semantic structural information between incomplete utterance and rewritten utterance or model the semantic structure implicitly and insufficiently. To address this problem, we propose a QUEry-Enhanced Network (QUEEN). Firstly, our proposed query template explicitly brings guided semantic structural knowledge between the incomplete utterance and the rewritten utterance making model perceive where to refer back to or recover omitted tokens. Then, we adopt a fast and effective edit operation scoring network to model the relation between two tokens. Benefiting from proposed query template and the well-designed edit operation scoring network, QUEEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，不完整话语重写引起了广泛关注。然而，先前的工作没有考虑不完整话语和重写话语之间的语义结构信息，也没有隐式和不充分地建模语义结构。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种增强查询网络（QUEEN）。首先，我们提出的查询模板明确地引入了不完整话语和重写话语之间的指导性语义结构知识，使模型能够理解在哪里进行参考或恢复被省略的标记。然后，我们采用一种快速有效的编辑操作评分网络来建模两个标记之间的关系。由于提出的查询模板和精心设计的编辑操作评分网络的好处，QUEEN在多个公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能。",
