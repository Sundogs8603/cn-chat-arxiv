    "translated_abstract": "在COVID-19大流行期间，关于南非用户生成内容的社交媒体研究非常少，使用手动标注方法更是凤毛麟角。疫苗接种是对抗疫情的主要手段，但疫苗犹豫危及公共卫生工作。本研究对与疫苗犹豫有关的南非推文进行情感分析，旨在训练AI媒介的分类模型，并评估其在分类用户生成内容时的可靠性。我们提取了来自南非的3万条推文，并将其手动标注为三个情感类别之一：积极、消极、中性。使用的机器学习模型包括LSTM、双向LSTM、SVM、BERT-base-cased和RoBERTa-base模型，通过WandB平台精心选择和调整了它们的超参数。我们使用了两种不同的预处理方法进行比较：一种基于语义，另一种基于语料库。",
