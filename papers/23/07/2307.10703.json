Granger causality has been widely used in many applied disciplines, from neuroscience and econometrics to Earth sciences. We revisit GC under a graphical perspective of state-space models. For that, we use GraphEM, a recently presented expectation-maximisation algorithm for estimating the linear matrix operator in the state equation of a linear-Gaussian state-space model. Lasso regularisation is included in the M-step, which is solved using a proximal splitting Douglas-Rachford algorithm. Experiments in toy examples and challenging climate problems illustrate the benefits of the proposed model and inference technique over standard Granger causality methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "Granger因果性(GC)经常被认为不是一种真正的因果关系形式。然而，它可以说是最广泛使用的评估一个时间序列从另一个时间序列中可预测性的方法。Granger因果性在许多应用学科中被广泛使用，从神经科学和计量经济学到地球科学。我们从状态空间模型的图形角度重新审视Granger因果性。为此，我们使用GraphEM，一种最近提出的用于估计线性高斯状态空间模型状态方程中的线性矩阵算子的期望最大化算法。在M步中包括Lasso正则化，使用一种近端拆分Douglas-Rachford算法进行求解。玩具例子和具有挑战性的气候问题上的实验说明了所提出的模型和推断技术相对于标准Granger因果性方法的优点。",
