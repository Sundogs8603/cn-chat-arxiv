    "abstract": "We study the problem of regret minimization for a single bidder in a sequence of first-price auctions where the bidder knows the item's value only if the auction is won. Our main contribution is a complete characterization, up to logarithmic factors, of the minimax regret in terms of the auction's transparency, which regulates the amount of information on competing bids disclosed by the auctioneer at the end of each auction. Our results hold under different assumptions (stochastic, adversarial, and their smoothed variants) on the environment generating the bidder's valuations and competing bids. These minimax rates reveal how the interplay between transparency and the nature of the environment affects how fast one can learn to bid optimally in first-price auctions.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在一系列一次性出价拍卖中，单个竞标人在只有在赢得拍卖时才知道物品价值的情况下，遗憾最小化的问题。我们的主要贡献是完整地刻画了拍卖的透明度对最小化感到遗憾的极小极大问题的影响，其中透明度调控了拍卖师在每次拍卖结束时公开竞争出价的信息量。我们的结果适用于不同假设（随机的、对抗性的和平滑变体）生成竞标人估值和竞争出价的环境。这些极小极大率揭示了透明度和环境性质之间的相互作用，以及影响一个人学习在一次性出价拍卖中如何最优出价的速度。",
