    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种用于测试动态仿射期限结构模型中风险溢价假设的识别鲁棒统计量。我们使用了Adrian等人（2013）中针对这些模型提出的时刻方程规范。我们将Guggenberger等人（2012）的子集（因子）安德森-鲁宾检验扩展到具有多个动态因子和时间变化风险价格的模型。与基于投影的测试不同，它提供了一种在更多参数上进行计算可行测试的方式。我们分析了实证研究中可能出现的识别问题。基于Adrian等人（2013）的三阶估计器的统计推断需要对因子质量有所了解，如果没有满秩的beta或与加载量相当大小的抽样误差，那么推断结果将是误导性的。实证应用显示，尽管某些因子可能较弱，但它们可能驱动风险价格的时间变动，而且识别问题较为突出。",
