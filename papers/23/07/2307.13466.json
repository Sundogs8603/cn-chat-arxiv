    "translated_abstract": "作物产量预测通常涉及使用理论驱动的基于过程的作物生长模型，这些模型在校准本地环境方面往往较为困难，或者使用需要大量数据集的数据驱动的机器学习方法。在这项工作中，我们使用一种混合元模建方法研究了马铃薯产量预测。我们采用作物生长模型生成合成数据来（预）训练卷积神经网络，然后使用观测数据进行微调。在模拟应用中，我们的元模建方法比纯粹的数据驱动方法获得更好的预测结果。在来自田间试验（n=303）和商业田地（n=77）的真实数据测试中，元模建方法相对于作物生长模型具有竞争力的结果。然而，在后者中，这两种模型的表现都不如由领域专家设计的手动选择特征集和专门预处理的简单线性回归模型。",
