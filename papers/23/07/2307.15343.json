    "translated_abstract": "本研究论文关注大规模语言模型（LLMs）中幻觉问题的挑战，特别是在医疗领域的背景下。幻觉指这些模型生成了合理但未经验证或错误的信息，这可能对医疗应用产生严重影响。我们提出了一个新的基准和数据集，Med-HALT（医疗领域幻觉测试），专门设计用于评估和减少幻觉。Med-HALT提供了一个多元化的跨国数据集，这些数据集来自不同国家的医疗检查，包括多种创新的测试模式。Med-HALT包括两类测试：推理和基于记忆的幻觉测试，旨在评估LLMs的问题解决和信息检索能力。我们的研究评估了文本Davinci，GPT-3.5，LlaMa-2，MPT和Falcon等领先的LLMs，揭示了它们在性能上的显著差异。这篇论文提供了有关数据集的详细见解，促进了进一步的研究和发展。",
