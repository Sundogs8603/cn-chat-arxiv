    "abstract": "Purpose: Previous quantitative MR imaging studies using self-supervised deep learning have reported biased parameter estimates at low SNR. Such systematic errors arise from the choice of Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function for network training, which is incompatible with Rician-distributed MR magnitude signals. To address this issue, we introduce the negative log Rician likelihood (NLR) loss. Methods: A numerically stable and accurate implementation of the NLR loss was developed to estimate quantitative parameters of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) model and intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model. Parameter estimation accuracy, precision and overall error were evaluated in terms of bias, variance and root mean squared error and compared against the MSE loss over a range of SNRs (5 - 30). Results: Networks trained with NLR loss show higher estimation accuracy than MSE for the ADC and IVIM diffusion coefficients as SNR decreases, with minimal loss of precision or total er",

    "translated_abstract": "目的：以前使用自监督深度学习进行的定量MRI研究报告在低信噪比条件下存在参数估计偏差的问题。这些系统误差来自于网络训练中选择的均方误差（MSE）损失函数，该函数与Rician分布的MR幅度信号不兼容。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了负对数Rician似然（NLR）损失。方法：我们开发了一个数值稳定且准确的NLR损失的实现，用于估计表观扩散系数（ADC）模型和体素内不相干运动（IVIM）模型的定量参数。通过在一系列信噪比（5-30）下比较偏差、方差和均方根误差来评估参数估计的准确性、精度和总体误差，并与MSE损失进行比较。结果：使用NLR损失训练的网络在SNR降低时显示出比MSE更高的ADC和IVIM扩散系数估计准确性，而精度或总误差几乎没有损失。",
