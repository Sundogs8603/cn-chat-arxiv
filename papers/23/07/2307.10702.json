The use of knowledge graphs for information modeling has attracted interest in recent years. In recommender systems, items and users can be mapped and integrated into the knowledge graph, which can represent more links and relationships between users and items. Constraint-based recommender systems are based on the idea of explicitly exploiting deep recommendation knowledge through constraints to identify relevant recommendations. When combined with knowledge graphs, a constraint-based recommender system gains several benefits in terms of constraint sets. In this paper, we investigate and propose the construction of a constraint-based recommender system via RDF knowledge graphs applied to the vehicle purchase/sale domain. The results of our experiments show that the proposed approach is able to efficiently identify recommendations in accordance with user preferences.",

    "translated_abstract": "知识图以RDF形式表示，能够通过本体模型来建模实体及其关系。近年来，知识图在信息建模方面受到了广泛关注。在推荐系统中，物品和用户可以被映射和集成到知识图中，从而可以表示用户和物品之间更多的链接和关系。基于约束的推荐系统基于显式利用约束来深入挖掘推荐知识，并识别相关的推荐。当结合知识图时，基于约束的推荐系统在约束集方面获得了多个优势。本文研究并提出了一种基于RDF知识图应用于车辆购买/销售领域的约束推荐系统的构建方法。我们的实验结果表明，所提出的方法能够高效地根据用户的偏好识别推荐。",
