    "translated_abstract": "一种合理的训练人工神经网络(ANN)的方法是将每个单元视为一个随机强化学习(RL)代理，从而将网络视为代理团队。因此，所有单元都可以通过REINFORCE学习，这是一种通过全局奖励信号调节的局部学习规则，更接近生物观察到的突触可塑性形式。然而，这种学习方法往往较慢，无法很好地适应网络的规模。这种效率低下主要是由两个因素造成的，阻碍了有效的结构化信用分配：(i)所有单元独立探索网络，(ii)使用单一奖励来评估所有单元的行动。因此，旨在改善结构化信用分配的方法通常可分为两类。第一类包括允许单元之间进行协调探索的算法，例如MAP传播。第二类涵盖了计算结构性信用分配的算法。",
