    "translated_abstract": "子模求解最大化问题在诸多应用中经常出现，并且吸引了来自人工智能、金融和运筹学等领域的广泛研究关注。先前的研究主要考虑了单一种类的约束，而很多现实世界中的问题常常涉及多个约束。本文考虑在$k$-matroid约束和$m$-knapsack约束的交集下进行子模求解最大化的问题，并且将部分枚举方法引入到同时贪心算法中，提出了一种新的算法SPROUT。我们证明了SPROUT可以实现比最先进的算法更好的多项式时间逼近保证。然后，我们将随机枚举和平滑技术引入到SPROUT中以提高其效率，得到了SPROUT++算法，该算法可以保持类似的逼近保证。在电影推荐和加权最大割的应用实验上进行了验证。",
