    "abstract": "Handwriting recognition has seen significant success with the use of deep learning. However, a persistent shortcoming of neural networks is that they are not well-equipped to deal with shifting data distributions. In the field of handwritten text recognition (HTR), this shows itself in poor recognition accuracy for writers that are not similar to those seen during training. An ideal HTR model should be adaptive to new writing styles in order to handle the vast amount of possible writing styles. In this paper, we explore how HTR models can be made writer adaptive by using only a handful of examples from a new writer (e.g., 16 examples) for adaptation. Two HTR architectures are used as base models, using a ResNet backbone along with either an LSTM or Transformer sequence decoder. Using these base models, two methods are considered to make them writer adaptive: 1) model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), an algorithm commonly used for tasks such as few-shot classification, and 2) writer codes",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习在手写识别方面取得了显著的成功。然而，神经网络的一个持久不足之处是它们不擅长处理数据分布的变化。在手写文本识别领域，这表现为对于与训练中所见到的作家不相似的作家，识别准确率较低。理想的手写文本识别模型应该能够适应新的书写风格，以处理大量可能的书写风格。在本文中，我们探讨了如何通过仅使用少量来自新作家的示例（例如16个示例）来使手写文本识别模型具有作家适应性。基于ResNet骨干网络和LSTM或Transformer序列解码器，使用了两种HTR架构作为基础模型。使用这些基础模型，考虑了两种使它们具有作家适应性的方法：1）模型不可知元学习（MAML），常用于少样本分类等任务的算法，和2）作家代码",
