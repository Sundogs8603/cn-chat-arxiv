    "translated_abstract": "传统的联邦学习使用样本数量计算每个客户端模型的权重，并使用这个固定权重值来融合全局模型。然而，在实际场景中，每个客户端设备和数据的异质性导致每个客户端模型的质量存在差异。因此，对全局模型的贡献不仅仅取决于样本量。此外，如果客户端故意上传低质量或恶意模型，使用这些模型进行聚合将严重降低全局模型的准确性。传统的联邦学习算法没有解决这些问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为FedDRL的模型融合方法，它使用两个阶段的强化学习。在第一个阶段，我们的方法可以过滤掉恶意模型，并选择可信的客户端模型参与模型融合。在第二个阶段，FedDRL算法自适应地调整可信客户端模型的权重并聚合。",
