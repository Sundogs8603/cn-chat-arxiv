    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型在建模数据分布和合成数据方面表现出了出色的性能。然而，传统的扩散模型需要完整或完全观察到的数据进行训练。在各种现实世界的应用中，包括医疗和金融，处理表格数据集时常常遇到数据不完整的问题。本工作提出了一个统一和有原则的基于扩散的框架，用于在各种缺失机制下从带缺失值的数据中学习。我们首先观察到广泛采用的“补全再生成”流程可能会导致有偏的学习目标。然后，我们建议在训练阶段屏蔽去噪评分匹配的回归损失。我们证明了所提出的方法在学习数据分布得分方面是一致的，并且所提出的训练目标在某些情况下作为负对数似然的上界。利用逼真和高效的多个表格数据集对所提出的框架进行了评估。",
