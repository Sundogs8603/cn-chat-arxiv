    "translated_abstract": "房地产是泰国经济中的一个关键领域，这导致了对更准确的土地价格预测方法的日益需求。传统的土地价格预测方法，如加权质量得分（WQS），由于依赖主观标准和缺乏对空间变量的考虑而受到限制。在本研究中，我们利用谷歌地图API提供的航空或卫星影像，增强了由卡塞科恩商业科技集团（KBTG）提供的数据集上的土地价格预测模型。我们提出了一种基于相似性的资产估值模型，使用预训练的EfficientNet架构的Siamese启发式神经网络来评估土地对之间的相似性。通过集成深度学习和基于树的模型，我们实现了约0.81的ROC曲线下面积（AUC），优于仅使用表格数据的基准模型。通过具有高于预定义阈值的相似性评分的附近土地的评估价格",
