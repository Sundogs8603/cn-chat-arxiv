    "abstract": "Economic interactions often occur in networks where heterogeneous agents (such as workers or firms) sort and produce. However, most existing estimation approaches either require the network to be dense, which is at odds with many empirical networks, or they require restricting the form of heterogeneity and the network formation process. We show how the functional differencing approach introduced by Bonhomme (2012) in the context of panel data, can be applied in network settings to derive moment restrictions on model parameters and average effects. Those restrictions are valid irrespective of the form of heterogeneity, and they hold in both dense and sparse networks. We illustrate the analysis with linear and nonlinear models of matched employer-employee data, in the spirit of the model introduced by Abowd, Kramarz, and Margolis (1999).",

    "translated_abstract": "经济交往通常发生在网络中，其中具有异质性的代理人（如工人或企业）进行排序和生产。然而，大多数现有的估计方法要么要求网络密集，与许多实证网络相矛盾，要么要求限制异质性的形式和网络形成过程。我们展示了如何将Bonhomme（2012）在面板数据背景下引入的功能差异方法应用于网络设置中，从而导出模型参数和平均效应上的矩约束。这些约束与异质性的形式无关，适用于密集和稀疏网络。我们借助线性和非线性的雇主-员工数据模型来说明分析方法，这与Abowd，Kramarz和Margolis（1999）提出的模型相似。",
