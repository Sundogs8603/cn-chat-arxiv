Large parcels of plastic waste are transported from inland to oceans leading to a global scale problem of floating debris fields. In this context, efficient and automatized monitoring of mismanaged plastic waste is paramount. To address this problem, we analyze the feasibility of macro-plastic litter detection using computational imaging approaches in river-like scenarios. We enable near-real-time tracking of partially submerged plastics by using snapshot Visible-Shortwave Infrared hyperspectral imaging. Our experiments indicate that imaging strategies associated with machine learning classification approaches can lead to high detection accuracy even in challenging scenarios, especially when leveraging hyperspectral data and nonlinear classifiers.

    "translated_abstract": "进入河流的塑料废物对当地生态系统造成了伤害，导致了负面的生态和经济影响。大量的塑料废物从内陆运输到海洋，形成了全球范围的漂浮垃圾场问题。在这种情况下，高效自动化地监测管理不善的塑料废物至关重要。为了解决这个问题，我们分析了在类似河流的环境中利用计算成像方法检测宏观塑料垃圾的可行性。我们利用快照可见-短波红外高光谱成像实现了部分浸没塑料的近实时跟踪。我们的实验表明，结合机器学习分类方法的成像策略可以在具有挑战性的场景中实现高检测精度，尤其是在利用高光谱数据和非线性分类器时。所有的代码、数据和模型都可以在线上获取：https://github.com/RIVeR-Lab/hyperspectral_macro_plastic_detection",
