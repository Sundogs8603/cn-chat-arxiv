    "translated_abstract": "最近，受变分自编码器启发的神经主题模型（NTM）引起了很多研究兴趣，然而，由于整合人类知识的挑战，这些方法在实际应用中受到了限制。本研究提出了一种半监督神经主题建模方法vONTSS，该方法利用基于von Mises-Fisher（vMF）的变分自编码器和最优传输。在半监督设置中，当提供每个主题的少量关键词时，vONTSS生成潜在主题并优化主题-关键词质量和主题分类。实验证明，vONTSS在分类准确率和多样性方面优于现有的半监督主题建模方法。vONTSS还支持无监督主题建模。定量和定性实验证明，vONTSS在无监督设置下在多个方面优于最近的NTM：vONTSS在基准数据集上发现高度聚类和连贯的主题。它也比现有-手法快得多。",
