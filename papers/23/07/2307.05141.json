Previous works proposed simple linear models that exhibited high sample efficiency and generalization power by allowing temporal modulation of movements (reproducing movements faster or slower), blending (merging two movements into one), via-point conditioning (constraining a movement to meet some particular via-points) and context conditioning (generation of movements based on an observed variable, e.g., position of an object). Previous works have proposed neural network-based motor primitive models, having demonstrated their capacity to perform tasks with some forms of input conditioning or time-modulation representations.

    "translated_abstract": "运动原理是可训练的参数模型，可以从有限的演示集合中复制机器人的运动。先前的工作提出了简单的线性模型，通过允许时间调制运动（加速或减速复制运动）、混合（将两个运动合并为一个）、通过点调节（将运动约束到特定的通过点）和上下文调节（基于观察到的变量生成运动，例如物体的位置）展示出高样本效率和泛化能力。以前的工作已经提出了基于神经网络的运动原理模型，并展示了它们在一些形式的输入调节或时间调制表达中执行任务的能力。然而，迄今为止还没有提出一个单一统一的深度运动原理模型，它能够具备所有先前的操作，这限制了神经运动原理的潜在应用。本文提出了一个深度运动原理的架构。",
