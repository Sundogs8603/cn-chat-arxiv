    "abstract": "In machine learning, we naturally apply an Observation-Oriented principle, in which observational variables preexist and set the stage for constructing relationships. While sufficient for traditional models, the integration of AI with big data exposes the misalignment between the observational models and our actual comprehension. Contrarily, humans shape cognitive entities defined by relationships, enabling us to formulate knowledge across temporal and hyper-dimensional spaces, rather than being confined to observational constructs. From an innovative Relation-Oriented perspective, this study examines the roots of this misalignment within our current modeling paradigm, illuminated by intuitive examples from computer vision and health informatics. We also introduce the relation-defined representation learning methodology as a practical implementation of Relation-Oriented modeling, supported by extensive experimental validation.",

    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习中，我们自然地应用一个观察导向的原则，其中观察变量先存在并为构建关系奠定基础。虽然对于传统模型来说足够了，但是人工智能与大数据的整合暴露了观察模型与我们的实际理解之间的不对齐。相反，人类塑造了由关系定义的认知实体，使我们能够跨越时间和超维度空间制定知识，而不是被限制在观察构建中。从一种创新的关系导向的视角出发，本研究通过来自计算机视觉和健康信息学的直观例子，分析了在我们当前的建模范式中这种不对齐的根源。我们还介绍了关系定义的表示学习方法作为关系导向建模的一种实际实施，支持广泛的实验验证。",
