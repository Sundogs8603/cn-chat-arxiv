    "translated_abstract": "从服务角度来看，多源领域自适应（MSDA）是一种适应部署模型到客户数据集的有希望的场景。它可以在没有目标标签的情况下提供适应，并支持多个领域构建的源数据集的情况。然而，这种方法依赖于先前的多源数据集的领域信息，即有多少个领域存在以及每个数据样本的领域标签。此外，MSDA需要同时拥有源数据集和目标数据集（物理上），这会导致客户设备存储限制或通过将客户数据传输到服务器引起数据隐私问题。为了更实际的模型自适应场景，我们放宽了这些限制，提出了一种新的问题场景，即三无领域自适应（TFDA），其中1）目标标签，2）源数据集，以及大部分3）源领域信息（领域标签+领域数量）都不可用。",
