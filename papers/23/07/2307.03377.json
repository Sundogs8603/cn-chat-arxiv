    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的方法来缓解负面迁移问题。在机器学习领域，通常的策略是采用单任务学习方法，训练一个监督模型来解决特定的任务。训练一个强大的模型需要大量的数据和大量的计算资源，这使得在数据不可用或收集成本高的情况下，这种解决方案不可行。因此，另一种基于任务之间信息共享的解决方案已经被开发出来：多任务学习（MTL）。尽管在MTL方面已经有了一些最新的进展，负面迁移问题仍然需要解决。负面迁移是一种现象，当噪声信息在任务之间共享时，会导致性能下降。本文提出了一种基于任务感知概念的新方法来缓解负面迁移问题。所提出的方法能够减少负面迁移，并提高性能。",
