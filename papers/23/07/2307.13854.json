In this paper, we build an environment for agent command and control that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on websites, and we create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and are desi",

    "translated_abstract": "随着生成式人工智能的进展，通过自然语言指令进行日常任务的自主智能体的潜力逐渐显现。然而，当前的智能体主要是在简化的合成环境中创建和测试的，严重限制了现实世界场景的表示能力。在本文中，我们构建了一个高度逼真且可复现的智能体指令和控制环境。具体而言，我们关注在网站上执行任务的智能体，我们创建了一个包含来自四个常见领域的完全功能网站的环境，分别是电子商务、社交论坛讨论、协同软件开发和内容管理。我们的环境使用工具（如地图）和外部知识库（如用户手册）来鼓励像人类一样解决任务。在我们的环境基础上，我们发布了一组重点评估任务完成功能正确性的基准任务。我们基准任务具有多样性和长远的视野，并且被设计为鼓励智能体进行更深层次的任务理解和解决。",
