However, current methods for identifying offensive content in such communication largely operate independent of context, with only a few approaches considering community norms or prior conversation as context. Here, we introduce a new approach to identifying inappropriate communication by explicitly modeling the social relationship between the individuals. We introduce a new dataset of contextually-situated judgments of appropriateness and show that large language models can readily incorporate relationship information to accurately identify appropriateness in a given context. Using data from online conversations and movie dialogues, we provide insight into how the relationships themselves function as implicit norms and quantify the degree to which context-sensitivity is needed in different conversation settings.

    "translated_abstract": "理解人际交流在一定程度上需要理解消息所说的社交背景和规范。然而，目前用于识别此类交流中冒犯内容的方法很大程度上独立于上下文，只有少数方法考虑到社区规范或先前对话作为上下文。在这里，我们介绍了一种通过显式地建模个体之间的社交关系来识别不适当交流的新方法。我们引入了一个新的具有上下文判断适宜性的数据集，并展示了大型语言模型可以很好地整合关系信息来准确地识别给定上下文中的适宜性。利用在线对话和电影对话的数据，我们揭示了关系本身作为暗含规范的功能，并量化了不同对话设置中需要上下文敏感性的程度。",
