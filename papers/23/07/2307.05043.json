    "abstract": "Aristotle's discussions on modal syllogistic have often been viewed as error-prone and have garnered significant attention in the literature due to historical and philosophical interests.

In this paper, drawing inspiration from the natural logic program, we propose and examine several variants of modal syllogistic within the epistemic context, thereby coining the term Epistemic Syllogistic. Specifically, we concentrate on the de re interpretation of epistemic syllogisms containing non-trivial yet natural expressions such as \"all things known to be A are also known to be not B.\" We explore the epistemic apodeictic syllogistic and its extensions, which accommodate more complex terms. Our main contributions include several axiomatizations of these logics, with completeness proofs that may be of independent interest.",

    "translated_abstract": "亚里士多德关于模态三段论的讨论常被视为容易出错的，由于历史和哲学的兴趣而受到了很大的关注。然而，从当代的角度来看，它们也引入了一阶模态逻辑的自然片段，值得进行全面的技术分析。在本文中，我们借鉴自然逻辑计划的灵感，提出并研究了认识背景下的几种变体模态三段论，从而创造了“认识主义三段论”这个术语。具体而言，我们集中在涉及非平凡但自然表达式的认识主义三段论的de re解释上，例如“被认知为A的所有事物也被认知为非B”。我们探索了认识主义必然三段论及其扩展，以适应更复杂的术语。我们的主要贡献包括这些逻辑的几个公理化，附带证明的完备性可能是独立的利益所在。",
