This study emphasizes efforts and prevailing trends to integrate multidisciplinary domain professions into machine acknowledgeable, data-driven processes in a two-fold organization: examining information uncertainty sources in knowledge representation and exploring knowledge decomposition with a three-tier knowledge-integrated machine learning paradigm.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管数字化趋势和数据量激增，但基于第一原理的模型（也称为逻辑驱动、基于物理、基于规则或基于知识的模型）与数据驱动方法存在并行存在，反映了关于符号主义与连接主义的持续AI辩论。在数据驱动过程中传输和利用领域知识的过程开发研究很少见。本研究强调将多学科领域专业知识整合到机器知识化的数据驱动过程中的努力和主流趋势，以两种方式组织：检查知识表示中的信息不确定性来源，并探索以三层知识整合的机器学习范式进行知识分解。这种方法平衡了工程领域的整体论和还原论观点。",
