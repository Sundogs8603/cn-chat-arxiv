    "abstract": "Research in Image Generation has recently made significant progress, particularly boosted by the introduction of Vision-Language models which are able to produce high-quality visual content based on textual inputs. Despite ongoing advancements in terms of generation quality and realism, no methodical frameworks have been defined yet to quantitatively measure the quality of the generated content and the adherence with the prompted requests: so far, only human-based evaluations have been adopted for quality satisfaction and for comparing different generative methods. We introduce a novel automated method for Visual Concept Evaluation (ViCE), i.e. to assess consistency between a generated/edited image and the corresponding prompt/instructions, with a process inspired by the human cognitive behaviour. ViCE combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) into a unified pipeline, aiming to replicate the human cognitive process in quality assessment.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，在图像生成领域取得了重要进展，尤其是在引入了能够根据文字输入产生高质量视觉内容的视觉语言模型的推动下。尽管在生成质量和逼真度方面不断取得进展，但目前尚未定义系统性的框架来定量衡量生成内容的质量和与提示要求的一致性：到目前为止，只有基于人类的评估被用于质量满意度和比较不同的生成方法。我们引入了一种新颖的自动化方法来进行视觉概念评估（ViCE），即评估生成/编辑的图像与相应提示/指令之间的一致性，这一过程受到人类认知行为的启发。ViCE将大型语言模型（LLMs）和视觉问答（VQA）的优势结合到一个统一的流程中，旨在复制人类认知过程中的质量评估。",
