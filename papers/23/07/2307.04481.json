    "translated_abstract": "制造工具如3D打印机已经变得可供更广泛的社会使用，数字制造对每个人的承诺似乎可以实现。尽管实际的制造过程在今天是大部分自动化的，但用户仍然需要掌握复杂的设计应用程序，以制作出准备好的设计对象，并根据需要进行调整，或者从零开始设计新的对象。为了降低个性化3D模型的设计和定制门槛，我们通过高保真Wizard of Oz研究与22名参与者一起探索了新手的心智模型在基于语音的3D建模中的体现。我们对收集到的数据进行主题分析，以了解新手的心智模型如何转化为基于语音的3D建模。最后，我们给出了用于语音助手的设计启示。例如，它们必须处理模糊、不完整和错误的命令；提供一组直接的命令来塑造简单和复合对象；并提供不同的策略来选择3D对象。",
