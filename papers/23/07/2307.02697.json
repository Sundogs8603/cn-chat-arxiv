    "translated_abstract": "Strahler数最初被提出用于描述河流分支的复杂性，并找到了各种应用。本文提出了计算自然语言句子树结构的Strahler数上下限的方法，这些结构可以在一个大型数据集中进行统计力学分析。通过对语法注释数据的经验性测量，显示自然语言句子的Strahler数几乎总是3或4，与Strahler（1957年）和Horton（1945年）报道的河流分流情况类似。从该数值的理论观点出发，我们证明它是在特定模型下处理句子所需记忆量的下限。对随机树进行的数学分析进一步假设了Strahler数的性质，揭示出它并非常数而是以对数形式增长。这一发现揭示了Strahler数作为描述自然语言句子特征的统计基础。",

    "en_tdlr": "This article utilizes statistical mechanics to analyze the upper and lower limits of the Strahler number for natural language sentence tree structures, revealing it is almost always 3 or 4 and serves as the lower limit for memory required to process sentences. Additionally, the analysis of random trees suggests that the Strahler number grows logarithmically, providing insight into its statistical significance as a characterization of natural language sentences."
