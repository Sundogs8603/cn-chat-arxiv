    "translated_abstract": "名人的行踪是非常重要的。例如，政治家去哪里，他们多久访问一次，以及他们会见谁，都带有深远的地缘政治和经济影响。虽然新闻文章包含了名人的旅行信息，但由于缺乏自动行程检测工具，无法进行大规模和网络分析。为了设计这样的工具，我们必须克服新闻文章之间的异质性带来的困难：1)一个单独的文章可能噪音很大，涉及无关的人物和地点，特别是当文章很长时。2)虽然考虑多篇文章一起来确定一个特定的行程可能会有帮助，但关键的语义仍然分散在不同的文章中，与各种噪声交织在一起，使其难以有效地汇总。3)超过20%的文章间接提及了名人的行程，而不是直接使用准确的名人姓名或地点名称，导致了大部分行程信息的缺失。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种从新闻文章中检测名人行程的方法，克服了文章间的异质性和噪声干扰，为进行大规模和网络分析提供了便利。",
