    "abstract": "Training energy-based models (EBMs) on discrete spaces is challenging because sampling over such spaces can be difficult. We propose to train discrete EBMs with energy discrepancy (ED), a novel type of contrastive loss functional which only requires the evaluation of the energy function at data points and their perturbed counter parts, thus not relying on sampling strategies like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Energy discrepancy offers theoretical guarantees for a broad class of perturbation processes of which we investigate three types: perturbations based on Bernoulli noise, based on deterministic transforms, and based on neighbourhood structures. We demonstrate their relative performance on lattice Ising models, binary synthetic data, and discrete image data sets.",

    "translated_abstract": "在离散空间上训练能量模型（EBMs）充满挑战，因为对这样的空间进行采样可能很困难。我们提出使用能量差异（ED）来训练离散EBMs，这是一种新型的对比损失函数，只需要评估数据点及其扰动对应点的能量函数，因此不依赖于像马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）这样的采样策略。能量差异为一类广泛的扰动过程提供了理论保证，我们研究了三种类型的扰动：基于伯努利噪声的扰动，基于确定性变换的扰动，以及基于邻域结构的扰动。我们在晶格伊辛模型、二值合成数据和离散图像数据集上展示了它们的相对性能。",
