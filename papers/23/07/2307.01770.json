    "translated_abstract": "Wassserstein距离和相关的最优输运计划在许多涉及概率度量的应用中被证明是有用的。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的平方Wasserstein距离的代理，称为min-SWGG，它基于两个输入分布的一维最优投影引导的运输映射。我们在min-SWGG和Wasserstein广义测地线之间建立了联系，其中枢纽测度在一条直线上得到支持。我们特别提供了一个新的闭合形式的精确Wasserstein距离，在其中一个分布支持在一条直线上的特殊情况下，使我们能够推导出一种适用于梯度下降优化的快速计算方案。我们表明min-SWGG是WD的上界，并且它具有与Sliced-Wasserstein类似的复杂度，同时提供了一个相关的输运计划。我们还研究了一些理论性质，如距离性、弱收敛、计算和拓扑性质等。",
