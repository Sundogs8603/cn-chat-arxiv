    "translated_abstract": "面对气候变化，公司真的在朝着更可持续经营迈出实质性的步伐吗？一个全面的答案可以在企业可持续性报告的密集信息中找到。然而，这些报告的数量和复杂性使人工分析成本非常高昂。因此，只有少数的机构拥有资源能够大规模分析这些报告，这导致可持续性报告缺乏透明度。通过基于LLM自动分析工具赋能利益相关者可能是实现可持续性报告分析民主化的一种有希望的方式。然而，开发这样的工具面临挑战，主要原因是LLM的幻觉问题和将领域专家引入AI开发过程的低效性。在本文中，我们介绍了ChatReport，这是一种基于LLM的新型系统，用于自动化分析企业可持续性报告，通过使答案可追溯来减少幻觉的危害，并解决领域专家参与AI开发过程的低效性。",
