The specific ciphers considered are Enigma, M-209, Sigaba, Purple, and Typex. We experiment with three classic machine learning models, namely, Support Vector Machines (SVM), $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN), and Random Forest (RF). We also experiment with four deep learning neural network-based models: Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Each model is trained on features consisting of histograms, digrams, and raw ciphertext letter sequences. Furthermore, the classification problem is considered under four distinct scenarios: Fixed plaintext with fixed keys, random plaintext with fixed keys, fixed plaintext with random keys, and random plaintext with random keys. Under the most realistic scenario, given 1000 characters per ciph",
