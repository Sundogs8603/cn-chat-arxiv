    "abstract": "From the standpoint of applied ontology, the problem of understanding and modeling causation has been recently challenged on the premise that causation is real. As a consequence, the following three results were obtained: (1) causation can be understood via the notion of systemic function; (2) any cause can be decomposed using only four subfunctions, namely Achieves, Prevents, Allows, and Disallows; and (3) the last three subfunctions can be defined in terms of Achieves alone. It follows that the essence of causation lies in a single function, namely Achieves. It remains to elucidate the nature of the Achieves function, which has been elaborated only partially in the previous work. In this paper, we first discuss a couple of underlying policies in the above-mentioned causal theory since these are useful in the discussion, then summarize the results obtained in the former paper, and finally reveal the nature of Achieves giving a complete solution to the problem of what causation is.",

    "translated_abstract": "从应用本体论的角度来看，最近一个挑战因果理解和建模问题的前提是因果很真实。因而获得了以下三个结果：(1)通过系统功能的概念可以理解因果；(2)任何原因都可以仅用四个子功能进行分解，即实现、防止、允许和不允许；(3)最后三个子功能可以仅用实现来定义。据此可以得出，因果的本质在于一个单一的功能，即实现。现在需要阐明实现功能的性质，在先前的工作中只部分展开了该问题。本文首先讨论了上述因果论中的几个基本原则，因为这些原则在讨论中很有帮助，然后总结了先前的研究结果，并最终揭示了实现的性质，从而全面解决了因果是什么的问题。",
