    "abstract": "In this paper house prices in Christchurch are analyzed over three distinct periods of time: post-2011 earthquake, pre-COVID-19 lockdown, and post-COVID-19 lockdown using the well-established hedonic price model. Results show that buyers, in periods that are temporally distant from the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, value the risk of potential earthquake damage to a property differently from buyers soon after the earthquake. We find that there are observable shifts in hedonic prices across the different time periods, specifically for section size pre and post COVID-19 lockdown.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过使用成熟的享乐价格模型，分析了克赖斯特彻奇的房价在三个不同的时间段内的变化：2011年地震后、COVID-19封锁前和COVID-19封锁后。结果显示，在与2011年地震时间相距较长的购房者中，对潜在地震损害的风险评估与震后不同。我们发现，在不同的时间段内，享乐价格存在可观察到的变化，尤其是COVID-19封锁前后的段落面积。",
