    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习在多分辨率图像的Pansharpening中发挥重要作用。由于缺乏地面真实数据，大多数基于深度学习的方法在降低分辨率领域进行监督训练。然而，对于高分辨率目标图像，训练在降低分辨率图像上的模型往往表现不佳。因此，一些研究团队现在转向在全分辨率领域进行无监督训练，通过定义合适的损失函数和训练范例。在这个背景下，我们最近提出了一个可以应用于许多现有架构的全分辨率训练框架。在这里，我们提出了一个新的基于深度学习的Pansharpening模型，充分利用了这种方法的潜力并提供了前沿的性能。除了与先前工作相比的架构改进，如使用残余注意力模块，所提出的模型还具有一个新的损失函数，可以同时促进光谱和空间保真度。",
