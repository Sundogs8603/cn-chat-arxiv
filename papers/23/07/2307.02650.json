    "translated_abstract": "我们处理大型复杂数据源的能力不断增加，为我们提供了新的重要应用研究问题，例如如何处理大规模数据库中的缺失值。Mitra等人（2023年）注意到了结构缺失（SM）的现象，即缺失具有潜在的结构。现有的缺失机制定义分类通常假设变量的缺失指示向量$M_1$，$M_2$，...，$M_p$在给定相关数据矩阵$\\mathbf{X}$的条件下是独立的。鉴于这在多变量设置中通常不适用于描述SM，我们引入了一种SM的分类体系，其中每个${M}_j$除了$\\mathbf{X}$之外，还可以依赖于$\\mathbf{M}_{-j}$（即除了${M}_j$之外的所有缺失指示向量）。我们将这个新框架嵌入到将机制分解为MCAR、MAR和MNAR（Rubin, 1976）的成熟分解中，从而允许我们将机制重新组合到一个更广泛的设置中。",
