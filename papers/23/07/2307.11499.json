    "translated_abstract": "随着深度神经网络的不断扩展和复杂化，大多数边缘设备无法处理其庞大的处理需求。因此，分布式推理的概念对于在节点集群中分配神经网络是必要的。然而，分布可能导致额外的能耗和设备之间的依赖，这些设备往往受到不稳定的传输速率的影响。不稳定的传输速率会影响物联网设备的实时性能，导致低延迟、高能耗和潜在的故障。因此，对于动态系统来说，必须有一个具有自适应架构的弹性DNN，可以根据可用资源调整大小。本文提出了一项实证研究，识别了可以在ResNet中删除而不会显著影响模型性能的连接，以在资源短缺的情况下实现分布。基于结果，提出了一个多目标优化问题，旨在最小化延迟和...",

    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes an adaptive ResNet architecture for distributed inference in resource-constrained IoT systems. By identifying connections that can be dropped without significantly impacting performance, the architecture allows for adaptive downsizing of the model. This reduces latency and energy consumption, while improving system resilience."
