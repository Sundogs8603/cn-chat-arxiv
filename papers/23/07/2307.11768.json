    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLM）执行越来越复杂的任务，验证其行为的正确性和安全性变得越来越困难。其中一种解决方法是要求LLM在回答问题时以逐步推理的方式外化其推理过程（思维链；CoT）。推理过程可以让我们检查模型执行任务的过程。然而，这种方法依赖于所陈述的推理能够忠实地反映模型的实际推理，而这并非总是如此。为了提高CoT推理的忠实度，我们通过将问题分解为子问题来生成推理。基于分解的方法在问答任务上取得了较好的性能，有时接近CoT，并在几个最近提出的度量标准中提高了模型所陈述推理的忠实度。通过强制模型在单独的上下文中回答简单的子问题，我们大大增加了模型的忠实度。",
