    "translated_abstract": "噪声训练标签会影响模型性能。大多数解决标签噪声的方法都假设标签噪声与输入特征无关。然而，在实践中，标签噪声往往与特征或实例相关，因此是有偏见的（即某些实例更可能被错误标记）。例如，在临床护理中，女性患者相比男性患者更容易被误诊为心血管疾病。忽略这种相关性的方法可能会产生区分性能差的模型，并且在许多医疗保健环境中可能加剧健康不平等问题。鉴于这些限制，我们提出了一种两阶段的方法来学习实例相关的标签噪声。我们的方法利用了\\anchor锚点，这是一个小的数据子集，我们知道其中的观测和真实标签。在多个任务中，我们的方法相对于现有方法实现了一致的性能改进。",
