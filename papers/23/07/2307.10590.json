    "translated_abstract": "最近深度神经网络（DNN）和传感器技术的进展使得自动驾驶系统（ADS）具有了越来越高的自主性。然而，评估其可靠性仍然是一个关键问题。目前的ADS测试方法修改模拟驾驶环境的可控属性，直到ADS出现问题。这种方法有两个主要缺点：（1）对模拟环境的修改可能不容易转移到实际测试环境（例如改变道路形状）；（2）即使ADS在某些环境中成功，这些环境实例也会被丢弃，尽管它们可能包含ADS可能出现问题的潜在驾驶条件。本文提出了一种新的ADS测试生成器——GenBo（GENerator of BOundary state pairs）。GenBo在一个无故障环境实例中变异自动驾驶车辆的驾驶条件（位置，速度和方向），并有效地生成可边界化的状态对。",
