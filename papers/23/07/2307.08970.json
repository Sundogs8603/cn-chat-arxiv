    "translated_abstract": "我们研究在不断观察下维护差分私有递减和的问题。我们提供了一个统一的框架和一个高效的算法解决这个问题，对于\\emph{任何足够平滑}的函数都适用。我们的算法是第一个对于多项式递减权重没有乘法误差的差分私有算法。我们的算法改进了之前所有在不断观察下的差分私有递减和的工作，并且作为一个推论，恢复了Henzinger等人（SODA 2023）在连续计数特例中的加法误差。我们的算法是基于因子化机制的变体，其误差取决于底层矩阵的$\\gamma_2$和$\\gamma_F$范数。我们为一大类下三角矩阵给出了一个几乎精确的$\\gamma_2$和$\\gamma_F$范数的上界的构造性证明，并且为$\\gamma_2$范数给出了一个几乎紧确的下界。这是对于下三角矩阵的第一个非平凡下界。",
