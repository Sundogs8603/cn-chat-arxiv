    "translated_abstract": "无谱偏差是一种在前馈人工神经网络中观察到的现象，即学习的函数的高频成分收敛速度比低频成分慢。这在各种人工神经网络中普遍存在，对于那些高频分辨率至关重要的领域，如物理信息神经网络（PINNs），这造成了技术挑战。极限学习机（ELM）可以消除解算过程中产生谱偏差（SB）的理论基础，理论上应该没有谱偏差。本研究验证了这一假设的可靠性，并证明它是不正确的。然而，ELM的结构使它们自然地适合于实施傅立叶特征嵌入的变体，已经证明可以减轻人工神经网络中的谱偏差。本研究实施并验证了这种方法完全消除了谱偏差，因此使ELM在实际问题（如PINNs）的应用成为可行。",
