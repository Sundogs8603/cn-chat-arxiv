    "translated_abstract": "近年来，Transformer模型在语言领域取得成功后，已成功应用于视觉任务。视觉Transformer已在包括图像分类、目标检测和语义分割等任务中推动了最新技术进展。尽管大量研究已证明使用卷积神经网络进行艺术归属和艺术认证任务取得了有希望的结果，本文重点研究了视觉Transformer在艺术认证方面的优势，并从而提高了计算机辅助艺术品认证的可靠性。使用由Vincent van Gogh真迹和两个对比数据集组成的精心编制的数据集，我们将Swin Transformer的艺术认证性能与EfficientNet进行了比较。通过使用包含模仿品和类似van Gogh风格画家作品的标准对比集，我们发现EfficientNet在整体上取得了最佳性能。",
