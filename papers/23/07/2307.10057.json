    "translated_abstract": "在最近几年，人工智能伦理已成为公众和专家讨论的热议话题。但是，那些构建人工智能的人 - 人工智能从业者对他们对人工智能伦理的理解以及将其纳入他们开发的基于人工智能系统中的挑战有何说法呢？了解人工智能从业者对人工智能伦理的看法很重要，因为他们是最接近人工智能系统并能够带来变革和改进的人。我们进行了一项调查，旨在了解人工智能从业者对人工智能伦理的认识和纳入伦理方面所面临的挑战。根据100名人工智能从业者的回答，我们的调查结果表明，大多数人工智能从业者对人工智能伦理有一定的了解，这主要归因于工作场所的规则和政策。隐私保护和安全是他们中大多数人熟悉的伦理原则。正规教育/培训在帮助人工智能从业者纳入人工智能伦理方面被认为是有所帮助的。挑战方面，他们认为缺乏共识、缺乏明确的指导和困惑的领导力是最主要的问题。",
