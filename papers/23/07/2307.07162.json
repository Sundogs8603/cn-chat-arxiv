    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLM）以人类方式理解驾驶环境及其在面对复杂情景时的推理、解释和记忆能力。我们认为，传统的基于优化和模块化的自动驾驶（AD）系统在处理长尾情况时面临着固有的性能限制。为了解决这个问题，我们提出理想的AD系统应该像人一样驾驶，通过持续驾驶积累经验，并使用常识解决问题。为了实现这一目标，我们确定了AD系统的三个关键能力：推理、解释和记忆。通过构建一个闭环系统展示LLM在驾驶场景中的理解和环境交互能力，我们证明了采用LLM在驾驶场景中的可行性。我们的大量实验证明LLM展现出推理并解决长尾情况的令人印象深刻的能力。",
