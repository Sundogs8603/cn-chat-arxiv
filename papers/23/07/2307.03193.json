    "abstract": "In the context of designing and implementing ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI), varying perspectives exist regarding developing trustworthy AI for autonomous cars. This study sheds light on the differences in perspectives and provides recommendations to minimize such divergences. By exploring the diverse viewpoints, we identify key factors contributing to the differences and propose strategies to bridge the gaps. This study goes beyond the trolley problem to visualize the complex challenges of trustworthy and ethical AI. Three pillars of trustworthy AI have been defined: transparency, reliability, and safety. This research contributes to the field of trustworthy AI for autonomous cars, providing practical recommendations to enhance the development of AI systems that prioritize both technological advancement and ethical principles.",
