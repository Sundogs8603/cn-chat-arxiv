    "translated_abstract": "机器学习和计算机视觉领域的最新研究已经突出了存在于真实对象识别基准数据集中的各种系统性缺陷。我们的基本观点是，这些缺陷根源于图像中编码的视觉信息与标注其的语义之间存在的多对多映射。其最终结果是当前的标注过程在很大程度上是不够明确的，因此给标注者的主观判断留下了过多的自由度。在本文中，我们提出了vTelos，一种集成了自然语言处理、知识表示和计算机视觉的方法，其主要目标是显性地呈现（否则隐性的）既定标注语义，从而减少主观选择的数量和作用。vTelos的一个关键要素是利用WordNet词汇-语义层次结构作为提供自然语言标签含义的主要手段，从而实现了标注语义的准确定义。",
