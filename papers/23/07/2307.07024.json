    "abstract": "In a fixed time horizon, appropriately executing a large amount of a particular asset -- meaning a considerable portion of the volume traded within this frame -- is challenging. Especially for illiquid or even highly liquid but also highly volatile ones, the role of \"market quality\" is quite relevant in properly designing execution strategies. Here, we model it by considering uncertain volatility and liquidity; hence, moments of high or low price impact and risk vary randomly throughout the trading period. We work under the central assumption: although there are these uncertain variations, we assume they occur in a fast mean-reverting fashion. We thus employ singular perturbation arguments to study approximations to the optimal strategies in this framework. By using high-frequency data, we provide estimation methods for our model in face of microstructure noise, as well as numerically assess all of our results.",

    "translated_abstract": "在一个固定的时间范围内，适当地执行大量特定资产的交易是具有挑战性的。特别是对于流动性较差或者即使是高流动性但也高度波动的资产，\"市场质量\"的作用在正确设计执行策略中非常重要。在这里，我们通过考虑不确定的波动性和流动性来对其进行建模；因此，在整个交易期间，高或低价格影响和风险的时刻会随机变化。我们的中心假设是：尽管存在这些不确定的变动，我们假设它们以快速均值回归的方式发生。因此，我们使用奇异摄动论证来研究在这个框架下对最优策略的近似。通过使用高频数据，我们提供了面对微观结构噪音的模型估计方法，并对所有结果进行了数值评估。",
