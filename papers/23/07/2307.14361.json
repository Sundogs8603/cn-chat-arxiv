    "abstract": "This study presents an ensemble model combining LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN, GRU, and GloVe to classify gene mutations using Kaggle's Personalized Medicine: Redefining Cancer Treatment dataset. The results were compared against well-known transformers like as BERT, Electra, Roberta, XLNet, Distilbert, and their LSTM ensembles. Our model outperformed all other models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Mean Squared Error. Surprisingly, it also needed less training time, resulting in a perfect combination of performance and efficiency. This study demonstrates the utility of ensemble models for difficult tasks such as gene mutation classification.",
