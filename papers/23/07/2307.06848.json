    "translated_abstract": "本文主要研究网络延迟估计问题，提出了一种更快速且保持高准确性的方法。方法利用网络节点的数据结构形成矩阵，通过引入时间维度构建了张量模型，将整个问题归结为张量完成问题。我们改进了张量Leverage Sampling策略，引入了Tensor QR分解来加快张量完成的过程。通过将张量奇异值分解（t-SVD）替换为张量CSVD-QR，实现了更快速的张量Levarage Sampling。为了加快不完全张量的完成速度，我们使用了张量的$L_{2,1}$-norm，而不是传统的张量核范数。此外，我们还将Tensor QR分解引入到交替方向乘子法（ADMM）中。",
