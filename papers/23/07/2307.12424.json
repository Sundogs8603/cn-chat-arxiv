An implicit assumption when aggregating ratings into item quality is that ratings are strong indicators of item quality. In this work, we test this assumption using data collected from a music discovery application. Our study focuses on two factors that cause rating inflation: heterogeneous user rating behavior and the dynamics of personalized recommendations. We show that user rating behavior substantially varies by user, leading to item quality estimates that reflect the users who rated an item more than the item quality itself. Additionally, items that are more likely to be shown via personalized recommendations can experience a substantial increase in their exposure and potential bias toward them. To mitigate these effects, we analyze the results of a randomized controlled trial in which the rating interface was modified. The test resulted in a substantial improve",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统依赖用户提供的数据来学习物品质量并提供个性化推荐。在将评分聚合为物品质量时，预设了评分是物品质量的强有力指标。本研究通过从音乐发现应用中收集的数据来测试这个假设。我们的研究集中在两个导致评分膨胀的因素上：异质的用户评分行为和个性化推荐的动态。我们显示出用户评分行为在用户之间存在较大差异，导致物品质量估计更多反映了评分用户而不是物品本身的质量。此外，通过个性化推荐更有可能展示的物品可能会经历大幅增加的曝光，并有潜在的偏好。为了缓解这些影响，我们分析了一个随机对照试验中评分界面修改的结果。测试结果显示了显著的改进。",
