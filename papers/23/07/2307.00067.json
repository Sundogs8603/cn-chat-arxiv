Transformer is a type of deep learning architecture initially developed to solve general-purpose Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and has subsequently been adapted in many fields, including healthcare. In this survey paper, we provide an overview of how this architecture has been adopted to analyze various forms of data, including medical imaging, structured and unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR), social media, physiological signals, and biomolecular sequences. Those models could help in clinical diagnosis, report generation, data reconstruction, and drug/protein synthesis. We identified relevant studies using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We also discuss the benefits and limitations of using transformer",

    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能在医疗保健等社会各个方面的日益渗透，Transformer神经网络架构的采用正在快速改变许多应用。Transformer是一种深度学习架构，最初是为了解决通用自然语言处理（NLP）任务而开发的，并随后在包括医疗保健在内的许多领域得到了应用。在本调查论文中，我们概述了该架构如何被应用于分析各种形式的数据，包括医学影像、结构化和非结构化的电子健康记录（EHR）、社交媒体、生理信号和生物分子序列。这些模型可以帮助临床诊断、报告生成、数据重建和药物/蛋白质合成。我们使用首选报告事项进行系统综述和meta分析（PRISMA）指南来确定相关研究。我们还讨论了使用Transformer的优点和局限性。",
