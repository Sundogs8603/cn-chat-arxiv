    "translated_abstract": "从认知信号(如fMRI)解码文本刺激可以增进我们对人类语言系统的理解，为构建多功能脑机接口铺平道路。然而，现有的研究主要集中在从受限词汇表解码个别单词级别的fMRI体积，这对于真实世界的应用来说过于理想化。在本文中，我们提出了fMRI2text，这是一个旨在桥接fMRI时间序列和人类语言的首个开放词汇量任务。此外，为了探索这个新任务的潜力，我们提出了一个基准解决方案UniCoRN: 统一认知信号重建用于脑解码。通过重建个别时间点和时间序列，UniCoRN建立了一个用于认知信号(fMRI和EEG)的强大编码器。利用预训练的语言模型作为解码器，UniCoRN证明了其在跨不同切割设置下从fMRI序列中解码连贯文本的有效性。我们的模型在fMRI2text上实现了34.77%的BLEU得分，在进行分叉时达到了37.04%的BLEU得分。",
