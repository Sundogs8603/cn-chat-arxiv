    "translated_abstract": "变化检测是地球观测领域中监测地球表面动态的重要且具有挑战性的任务。深度学习技术的出现最近推动了自动变化检测的技术革命。然而，基于深度学习的变化检测方法仍然存在两个主要问题：1）不充分的时间关系建模和2）伪变化误分类。为了解决这些问题，我们将度量学习的强大时间建模能力与分割的显著拟合能力相结合，提出了一种用于稳健和可解释的变化检测的深度变化特征学习（DeepCL）框架。首先，我们设计了一种具有硬样本感知对比损失，该损失重新权衡了硬样本和简单样本的重要性。这种损失允许显式地建模双时相遥感图像之间的时间相关性。此外，建模的时间关系被用作先验知识来指导分割过程，以便检测变化。",
