    "abstract": "In this endeavor, we developed a comprehensive system that processes integrated visual features derived from video frames captured by a regular camera, along with depth details obtained from a point cloud scanner. This system is designed to anticipate driving actions, encompassing both vehicle speed and steering angle. To ensure its reliability, we conducted assessments where we juxtaposed the projected outcomes with the established norms adhered to by skilled real-world drivers. Our evaluation outcomes indicate that the forecasts achieve a noteworthy level of accuracy in a minimum of half the test scenarios (ranging around 50-80%, contingent on the specific model). Notably, the utilization of amalgamated features yielded superior performance in comparison to using video frames in isolation, as demonstrated by most of the cases.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这个研究中，我们开发了一个综合系统，通过处理由普通摄像头拍摄的视频帧衍生出的综合视觉特征以及从点云扫描仪获得的深度细节。该系统旨在预测驾驶行为，包括车辆速度和转向角度。为了确保其可靠性，我们进行了评估，将预测结果与熟练的真实驾驶员遵循的既定规范进行了对比。我们的评估结果表明，预测在至少一半的测试场景中实现了显著的准确性水平（根据具体模型，在50-80%之间）。值得注意的是，使用综合特征相比于只使用视频帧在大多数情况下表现更好。",
