    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统不仅是一个从数据中归纳统计的问题，也是一个需要推理能力的认知任务。最先进的图神经网络在推荐系统中被广泛使用，因为它们能够从图结构数据中捕捉到隐式结构信息。然而，像大多数神经网络算法一样，它们只从感知的角度学习匹配模式。一些研究者使用用户行为进行逻辑推理，从认知推理的角度实现推荐预测，但这种推理是局部的，忽视了全局范围内的隐式信息。在这项工作中，我们结合了图神经网络和命题逻辑操作的优势，构建了一个具有全局隐式推理能力和局部显式逻辑推理能力的神经符号推荐模型。我们首先基于相邻交互原则构建了一个物品-物品图，并使用图神经网络对其进行学习和推理。然后，我们引入了命题逻辑操作，使模型能够从全局范围内进行推理。最后，我们通过实验证明了该模型的有效性和准确性。",
