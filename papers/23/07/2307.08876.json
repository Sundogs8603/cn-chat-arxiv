    "translated_abstract": "新系统利用机器学习对大型知识源进行筛选，创建灵活的大语言模型。这些模型可以分辨不同通信形式中的上下文，并预测顺序信息。生成式AI利用Transformer生成文本或视觉输出，模仿人类回应。它提供了一个或多个上下文相关的可行解决方案供用户思考。然而，生成式AI目前不支持思想的可追溯性，而搜索引擎可以提供信息来源的有用功能。生成式AI的叙述风格受到了积极的评价。人们通过故事学习。然而，早期ChatGPT在真实性、参考、计算和准确地地图等方面遇到了困难。当前的能力参考位置和链接到应用似乎更适合我们使用了二十年的以链接为中心的搜索方法。部署真正可信的解决方案超越了模拟上下文相关性。",

Additionally, it identifies challenges in terms of truth, reference, and accurate mapping in generative AI."
