    "translated_abstract": "经历强引力透镜效应的类星体对宇宙膨胀速率、前景偏折器内的暗物质分布以及类星体宿主星系等相关问题提供了独特的视角。然而，由于非透镜星体的数量过多，将它们在天文图像中准确识别出来具有挑战性。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了一种新颖的方法，即使用先进的卷积网络（如ResNet、Inception、NASNet、MobileNet、EfficientNet和RegNet）与基于Hyper Suprime-Cam（HSC）多波段图像的现实星系-类星体透镜模拟训练的视觉转换器（ViTs）进行集成。虽然单个模型在测试数据集上表现出色，ROC曲线下面积达到97.3%以上，中位误报率为3.6%，但在真实数据中很难泛化，每个分类器都会选择出大量虚假源。 一个重要的原因是透镜类星体的数量比非透镜类星体少得多。",
