Our insight is that there is structure in arithmetic that these approaches are not using.

    "translated_abstract": "整数分布在概率建模中非常常见，但对于许多当今的概率编程语言来说仍然具有挑战性。核心挑战来自于离散结构：当今的概率编程语言推理策略往往依赖于枚举、采样或微分来进行扩展，但这些方法在涉及整数的高维复杂离散分布上失效。我们的观点是，这些方法没有利用到算术中的结构。我们提出了一种针对离散分布的二进制编码策略，利用了整数运算（如求和和比较）的丰富逻辑结构。我们利用这种结构化编码和知识编译进行精确的概率推理，并展示了这种方法在具有算术的更大整数分布上的扩展能力。",
