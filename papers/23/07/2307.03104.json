    "translated_abstract": "句子嵌入使我们能够捕捉短文本的语义相似性。大多数句子嵌入模型是针对一般语义文本相似性（STS）任务进行训练的。因此，要在特定领域中使用句子嵌入，必须将模型适应于该领域以获得良好的结果。通常，这是通过对感兴趣的域对整个句子嵌入模型进行微调来实现的。虽然这种方法能够产生最先进的结果，但在微调过程中更新了所有模型的权重，使该方法在资源上要求较高。因此，我们提出了训练轻量级适配器的方法，而不是单独为每个目标领域微调整个句子嵌入模型。这些特定领域的适配器不需要微调所有底层句子嵌入模型的参数。相反，我们只训练少量的额外参数，同时保持底层句子嵌入模型的权重不变。训练特定领域的适配器可以始终使用同一模型并在不同领域中获得良好的性能。",
