    "translated_abstract": "在编程教育中，参考其他用户编写的解决方案程序对学习者很有帮助。然而，当前的在线评测系统只是列出用户提交的所有解决方案程序供参考，并根据提交日期、执行时间或用户评分进行排序，忽视了程序能够成为参考的程度。此外，由于存在太多重复和近似重复的程序，用户很难参考多种解决方法。为了激励学习者参考不同的解决方法以学习更好的解决方案，本文提出了一种在每个编程问题中去重和排名常见解决方案程序的方法。基于更多重复的程序采用更常见的方法并可作为参考的假设，我们删除了近似重复的解决方案程序，并根据重复计数对唯一的程序进行排序。实验结果表明这个方法能够有效地去重和排名解决方案程序。",
