    "translated_abstract": "Hansen-Jagannathan (HJ)距离统计量是模型错误的最主要指标之一。然而，传统的HJ规范检验程序在有限样本下的性能较差，我们发现，即使在样本较大的情况下，当（代理）因子与资产收益呈较小的相关性时，它也可能尺寸扭曲。换句话说，应用研究人员很可能在模型正确规范的情况下错误地拒绝了该模型。我们提供了两种HJ统计量的替代方法和两种相应的新的模型规范测试程序，可以抵御弱（代理）因子的影响，并且我们还提供了一种新的鲁棒风险溢价估计方法。仿真实验支持我们的理论。我们的实证应用证明了传统HJ检验的不可靠性，因为当比较嵌套模型时，它可能产生不符合常理的结果，即拒绝了一个四因子模型但却没有拒绝降低至三因子模型。同时，我们提出的方法可以解决这个问题。",
