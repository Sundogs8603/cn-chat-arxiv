    "translated_abstract": "背景：通过分析组织模式和细胞形态，对数字病理学图像进行分析是为了得出诊断结论的必要步骤。然而，手动评估费时、昂贵并且容易出现观察者之间和观察者内部的变异性。目标：为了帮助病理学家使用计算机化解决方案，必须提出自动组织结构检测和分割方法。此外，为组织病理学图像生成像素级对象注释也是费时费力的。因此，具有边界框标签的检测模型可能是一个可行的解决方案。设计：本文研究了一种用于显微图像的实时目标检测器YOLO-v4（You Only Look Once）。YOLO使用单一神经网络来预测感兴趣目标的多个边界框和类别概率。YOLO可以通过使用全切片图像进行训练来提升检测性能。本文中使用YOLO-v4来进行人类肾脏图像中的肾小球检测。多个实验表明YOLO-v4在肾小球检测方面具有较好的表现。",
