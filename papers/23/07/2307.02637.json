    "abstract": "Large events such as conferences, concerts and sports games, often cause surges in demand for ride services that are not captured in average demand patterns, posing unique challenges for routing algorithms. We propose a learning framework for an autonomous fleet of taxis that scrapes event data from the internet to predict and adapt to surges in demand and generates cooperative routing and pickup policies that service a higher number of requests than other routing protocols. We achieve this through a combination of (i) an event processing framework that scrapes the internet for event information and generates dense vector representations that can be used as input features for a neural network that predicts demand; (ii) a two neural network system that predicts hourly demand over the entire map, using these dense vector representations; (iii) a probabilistic approach that leverages locale occupancy schedules to map publicly available demand data over sectors to discretized street inters",

    "translated_abstract": "大型事件通常会引发拼车服务需求的激增，而这些需求不会被平均需求模式所捕捉到，给路由算法带来了独特的挑战。我们提出了一个学习框架，用于自动化出租车车队，从互联网上获取事件数据以预测和适应需求激增，并生成协同的路由和接乘策略，以服务更多的请求比其他路由协议。我们通过以下方式实现这一目标：(i)一个事件处理框架，用于从互联网上抓取事件信息并生成密集的向量表示，作为神经网络的输入特征来预测需求；(ii)一个双神经网络系统，使用这些密集的向量表示来预测整个地图上的每小时需求；(iii)一种基于概率的方法，利用区域占用时间表将公开的需求数据映射到离散化的街道交叉口上。",
