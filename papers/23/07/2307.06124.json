    "abstract": "Current signing avatars are often described as unnatural as they cannot accurately reproduce all the subtleties of synchronized body behaviors of a human signer. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic approach for transitions between signs, focusing on mouthing animations for Portuguese Sign Language. Although native signers preferred animations with dynamic transitions, we did not find significant differences in comprehension and perceived naturalness scores. On the other hand, we show that including mouthing behaviors improved comprehension and perceived naturalness for novice sign language learners. Results have implications in computational linguistics, human-computer interaction, and synthetic animation of signing avatars.",

    "translated_abstract": "当前的手语动画经常被认为是不自然的，因为它们不能准确地复制人类手语者的同步身体行为的细微差别。在本文中，我们提出一种新的动态方法，用于手语之间的过渡，重点放在葡萄牙手语的嘴型动画上。虽然母语手语者更喜欢具有动态过渡的动画，但我们并未发现在理解和感知自然度评分方面存在显著差异。另一方面，我们表明包含嘴型行为对于初学手语的学习者来说，提高了理解和感知自然度。这些结果对计算语言学、人机交互和手语动画的合成具有重要意义。",
