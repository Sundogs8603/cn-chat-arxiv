    "abstract": "While explainability is a desirable characteristic of increasingly complex black-box models, modern explanation methods have been shown to be inconsistent and contradictory. The semantics of explanations is not always fully understood - to what extent do explanations \"explain\" a decision and to what extent do they merely advocate for a decision? Can we help humans gain insights from explanations accompanying correct predictions and not over-rely on incorrect predictions advocated for by explanations? With this perspective in mind, we introduce the notion of dissenting explanations: conflicting predictions with accompanying explanations. We first explore the advantage of dissenting explanations in the setting of model multiplicity, where multiple models with similar performance may have different predictions. In such cases, providing dissenting explanations could be done by invoking the explanations of disagreeing models. Through a pilot study, we demonstrate that dissenting explanation",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管可解释性是日益复杂的黑盒模型的一个可取特征，但现代解释方法已被证明是不一致和矛盾的。解释的语义并不总是完全理解的 - 解释在多大程度上\"解释\"一个决策，在多大程度上只是支持一个决策？我们能否帮助人们从伴随正确预测的解释中获得洞察力，而不是过度依赖解释所提倡的错误预测？在这个角度上，我们引入了不同的解释概念: 伴随冲突预测的解释。我们首先探讨了在模型多样性设置下不同解释的优势，其中具有相似性能的多个模型可能有不同的预测。在这种情况下，提供不同的解释可以通过调用不同模型的解释实现。通过一项试点研究，我们证明了不同解释的价值。",
