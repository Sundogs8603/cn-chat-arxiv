    "translated_abstract": "深度学习已成功应用于人体活动识别。然而，训练深度神经网络需要明确标记的数据，而获取这些数据很困难。本文提出了一种采用多个Siamese网络的模型，仅利用数据样本对之间的相似性信息进行训练，而不知道明确的标签。训练后的模型将活动数据样本映射为固定大小的表示向量，使得表示空间中向量之间的距离近似于输入空间中数据样本的相似性。因此，训练后的模型可以作为广泛的不同聚类算法的度量标准。训练过程通过最小化相似性损失函数，使得同一种活动的样本对的距离度量小，并使得不同种活动的样本对的距离度量大。我们在三个数据集上对该模型进行评估，验证其在分割中的有效性。",
