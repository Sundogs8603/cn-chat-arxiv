    "translated_abstract": "时变定价电费激励消费者调整电力需求以降低成本，但可能增加对反应能力有限的消费者的能源负担。因此，能源公司在设计这些定价方案时必须平衡可负担性和激励效果，并考虑消费者的反应期望。本文提出了一种基于联合学习和优化方法的公平时变定价电费设计方法。我们的方法将历史价格和需求响应数据编码为递归神经网络（RNN），以捕捉高维和非线性的消费者价格响应行为。然后，我们将RNN嵌入到定价方案优化中，构建一个目标为二次型的非线性优化问题。我们提出了一种基于梯度的解决方法，实现快速和可扩展的计算。使用真实消费者数据进行的模拟表明，我们的公平定价方案在保护低收入消费者免受价格波动的同时，有效地激励了能源调整行为。",
