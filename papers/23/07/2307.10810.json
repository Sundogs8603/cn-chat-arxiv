    "abstract": "Imitation learning (IL) seeks to teach agents specific tasks through expert demonstrations. One of the key approaches to IL is to define a distance between agent and expert and to find an agent policy that minimizes that distance. Optimal transport methods have been widely used in imitation learning as they provide ways to measure meaningful distances between agent and expert trajectories. However, the problem of how to optimally combine multiple expert demonstrations has not been widely studied. The standard method is to simply concatenate state (-action) trajectories, which is problematic when trajectories are multi-modal. We propose an alternative method that uses a multi-marginal optimal transport distance and enables the combination of multiple and diverse state-trajectories in the OT sense, providing a more sensible geometric average of the demonstrations. Our approach enables an agent to learn from several experts, and its efficiency is analyzed on OpenAI Gym control environment",

    "translated_abstract": "模仿学习旨在通过专家示范来教授智能体特定任务。模仿学习的关键方法之一是定义智能体和专家之间的距离，并找到使该距离最小化的智能体策略。最优传输方法在模仿学习中被广泛使用，因为它们提供了衡量智能体和专家轨迹之间有意义距离的方法。然而，如何最佳地结合多个专家示范的问题并没有得到广泛研究。标准方法是简单地串联状态（-动作）轨迹，但在轨迹为多模态时存在问题。我们提出了一种替代方法，使用多边际最优传输距离，能够在最优传输的意义下结合多个和多样化的状态轨迹，提供更合理的示范几何平均值。我们的方法使智能体能够从多个专家中学习，并在OpenAI Gym控制环境中进行了效率分析。",
