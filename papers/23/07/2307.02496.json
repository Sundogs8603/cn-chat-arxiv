    "translated_abstract": "电解是环保的氢气生产过程中的关键，但是过程中产生的气泡会阻碍反应，降低电池效率，增加能量消耗。此外，这些气泡会导致电池内部的电导率发生变化，从而导致周围产生感应磁场的变化。因此，利用外部磁传感器测量这些气泡引起的磁场波动，并求解Biot-Savart定律的反问题，可以估计电池内的电导率，从而得到气泡的大小和位置。然而，仅凭几个感应磁场测量值确定高分辨率电导率图是一个病态反问题。为了克服这个问题，我们利用可逆神经网络（INN）重建电导率场。我们的定性结果和使用随机误差扩散的定量评估表明，与Tikhonov正则化相比，INN具有更优异的性能。",
