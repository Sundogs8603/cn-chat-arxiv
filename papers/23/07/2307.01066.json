    "translated_abstract": "在药物发现中，蛋白质-配体相互作用（PLI）的预测在指导有效结合目标蛋白的分子的鉴定和优化方面起着关键作用。尽管基于深度学习的PLI预测取得了显著进展，但开发一种能够准确评分结合亲和力和进行高效虚拟筛选的通用模型仍然是一个挑战。实验结构-亲和力数据的稀缺性是实现这一目标的主要障碍，限制了现有模型的泛化能力。在本文中，我们提出了一个可行的解决方案，通过引入一种新颖的数据增强策略以及一种基于物理原理的图神经网络，来应对这一挑战。该模型在评分和筛选方面显示出显著的改进，在各种测试中超过了特定任务的深度学习模型，并且与基于距离的现有性能相当。",
