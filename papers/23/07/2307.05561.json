    "translated_abstract": "随着对机器人操作应用的需求增加，准确的基于视觉的6D位姿估计对于自主操作变得至关重要。之前已经引入了基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的位姿估计方法。然而，对于准确的机器人操作，对更好的性能的追求仍然存在。这种追求延伸到了农业机器人领域。在本文中，我们提出了TransPose，一种基于Transformer的改进的带深度细化模块的6D位姿估计方法。该架构只接受RGB图像作为输入，没有额外的补充模态，如深度或红外图像。该架构包含了一个创新的轻量级深度估计网络，使用特征金字塔和上采样方法从RGB图像估计深度。提出了一个基于Transformer的检测网络，带有额外的预测头，可以直接回归物体的中心并预测目标的6D位姿。一个新颖的深度细化方法被提出，通过迭代优化来提高深度估计的精度。",
