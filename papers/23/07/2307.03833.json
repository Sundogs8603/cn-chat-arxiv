    "translated_abstract": "基于学习的方法在大多数基准测试中比传统的基于优化的方法表现更好，它们主导了3D人体姿势估计任务。然而，在野外的3D人体姿势估计仍然是基于学习的模型面临的最大挑战，无论是2D-3D提升，图像到3D还是基于扩散的方法，因为训练的网络隐含地学习了相机内参和基于领域的3D人体姿势分布，并通过统计平均来估计姿势。另一方面，基于优化的方法可以逐案例估计结果，能够在野外预测更多样化和复杂的人体姿势。通过结合基于优化和基于学习的方法的优势，我们提出了一种零样本扩散优化（ZeDO）管道用于解决跨领域和野外3D人体姿势估计的问题。我们的多假设ZeDO在Human3.6M数据集上达到了最先进的性能（minMPJPE 51.4mm），并且无需对其进行训练。",
