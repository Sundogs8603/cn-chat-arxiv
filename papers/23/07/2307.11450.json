    "abstract": "Traditional topic identification solutions from audio rely on an automatic speech recognition system (ASR) to produce transcripts used as input to a text-based model. These approaches work well in high-resource scenarios, where there are sufficient data to train both components of the pipeline. However, in low-resource situations, the ASR system, even if available, produces low-quality transcripts, leading to a bad text-based classifier. Moreover, spontaneous speech containing hesitations can further degrade the performance of the ASR model. In this paper, we investigate alternatives to the standard text-only solutions by comparing audio-only and hybrid techniques of jointly utilising text and audio features. The models evaluated on spontaneous Finnish speech demonstrate that purely audio-based solutions are a viable option when ASR components are not available, while the hybrid multi-modal solutions achieve the best results.",

    "translated_abstract": "传统的音频主题识别解决方案依赖于自动语音识别系统（ASR）生成用作文本模型输入的转录。这些方法在高资源场景下效果良好，其中有足够的数据来训练管道的两个组件。然而，在低资源情况下，即使ASR系统可用，也会产生低质量的转录，导致文本分类器效果不佳。此外，包含停顿的自发语音进一步降低了ASR模型的性能。本文通过比较仅使用音频和混合多模态技术来探讨替代标准仅文本解决方案的方法。在自发的芬兰语音上评估的模型表明，当ASR组件不可用时，纯音频解决方案是一个可行的选项，而混合多模态解决方案获得了最佳结果。",
