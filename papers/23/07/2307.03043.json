    "translated_abstract": "对于任意两个大小不超过n的点集A，B，从A到B的Chamfer距离定义为CH(A,B)=∑(a∈A)min(b∈B)dX(a,b)，其中dX是底层距离度量（例如欧几里得距离或曼哈顿距离）。Chamfer距离是衡量点云之间差异的一种常用方法，被广泛应用于机器学习、计算机视觉和图形学等领域，并且有一个直观的O(dn^2)时间复杂度的暴力算法。然而，运行时间对n的二次依赖使得直接算法在处理大数据集时难以承受。我们克服了这个瓶颈，并提出了第一个具有近线性运行时间的$(1+\\epsilon)$-近似算法来估计Chamfer距离。具体而言，我们的算法的运行时间为O(ndlog(n)/ε^2)，可以实现。",
