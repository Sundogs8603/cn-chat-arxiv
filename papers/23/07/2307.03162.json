    "abstract": "The assembly instruction is a mandatory component of Lego-like brick sets.The conventional production of assembly instructions requires a considerable amount of manual fine-tuning, which is intractable for casual users and customized brick sets.Moreover, the traditional paper-based instructions lack expressiveness and interactivity.To tackle the two problems above, we present BrickPal, an augmented reality-based system, which visualizes assembly instructions in an augmented reality head-mounted display. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate plausible assembly sequences, and provide real-time guidance in the AR headset.Our user study demonstrates BrickPal's effectiveness at assisting users in brick assembly compared to traditional assembly methods. Additionally, the NLP algorithm-generated assembly sequences achieve the same usability with manually adapted sequences.",

    "translated_abstract": "装配指导书是类似乐高积木套装的强制性组成部分。传统的装配指导书制作需要大量的手动调整，这对于休闲用户和定制积木套装来说是棘手的。此外，传统的纸质指导书缺乏表现力和互动性。为了解决以上两个问题，我们提出了BrickPal，一种基于增强现实的系统，该系统通过增强现实头戴显示器可视化装配指导书。它利用自然语言处理（NLP）技术生成合理的装配顺序，并在增强现实头盔中提供实时指导。我们的用户研究证明，与传统的装配方法相比，BrickPal在帮助用户进行积木装配方面是有效的。此外，NLP算法生成的装配顺序与手动调整的顺序具有相同的可用性。",
