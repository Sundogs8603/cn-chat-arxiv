    "translated_abstract": "金融投资组合构建问题通常被表述为属于计算复杂性理论中的非确定性多项式时间（NP-难）类别的二次和离散（组合）优化问题。伊辛机是工作于量子机械/量子启发式原理下的硬件设备，用于快速解决NP-难优化问题，从而能够基于NP-难优化在时间限制下进行高速交易策略的决策。在这里，我们报道了一个实时股票交易系统，通过NP-难投资组合优化来确定多空持仓，从而改善夏普比率，使用的是一种基于量子启发式算法（模拟分岔）的嵌入式伊辛机。伊辛机根据一个涉及最大化瞬时预期收益（与成交量加权离差）的目标函数，从一个N只股票的宇宙中选择一个平衡（Delta-中性）组合的股票。",
