    "translated_abstract": "众所周知，利用传统的深度神经网络（DNN）进行太赫兹多谐振石墨烯超表面的反向设计具有有限的泛化能力。本文提出了改进的Transformer和条件生成对抗神经网络（CGAN）来基于太赫兹多谐振吸收谱进行石墨烯超表面的反向设计。改进的Transformer在Spectrum to Vector（S2V）设计中相比传统的多层感知器（MLP）神经网络能够获得更高的精确度和泛化性能；而通过CGAN实现的Spectrum to Image（S2I）设计可以提供比MLP获得的S2V设计更全面的信息和更高的准确度。此外，改进的CGAN还可以直接从所需的多谐振吸收谱中实现石墨烯超表面图像的反向设计。研究表明，这项工作可以促进人工智能生成的超表面设计过程。",
