Unlike traditional approaches that require labeled samples for training, AL iteratively selects unlabeled samples to be annotated by an expert. This protocol aims to prioritize the most informative samples, leading to improved model performance compared to training with all labeled samples.

This paper presents a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the theory of AL reviewing the latest advancements across various domains.

    "translated_abstract": "主动学习（AL）是一类在当前人工智能时代之前存在的机器学习（ML）算法。与传统方法需要标记样本进行训练不同，AL通过迭代选择未标记的样本由专家进行注释。这个协议旨在优先选择最具信息量的样本，使得模型性能相对于使用全部标记样本进行训练来说有所提升。近年来，AL在物理学领域引起了越来越多的关注。本文对AL的理论进行全面且易于理解的介绍，并回顾了各个领域的最新进展。此外，我们探讨了AL与量子ML的潜在整合，设想了这两个领域的协同融合，而不仅仅把AL视为经典ML在量子领域的扩展。",
