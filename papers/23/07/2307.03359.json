    "translated_abstract": "基于系统日志的异常检测在智能运营中起着重要作用，由于日志模式的极端复杂性，这是一个具有挑战性的任务。现有的方法通过捕获日志序列中的顺序依赖关系来检测异常，但忽略了子序列的相互作用。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种考虑组件子序列相关性的日志异常检测方法：CSCLog。该方法不仅捕获子序列中的顺序依赖关系，还对子序列的隐式相关性进行建模。具体而言，基于组件从日志序列中提取子序列，并通过长短期记忆网络（LSTM）来捕获子序列中的顺序依赖关系。引入隐式相关性编码器来自适应地建模子序列的隐式相关性。此外，采用图卷积网络（GCN）来实现子序列的信息交互。最后，利用注意机制来融合信息。",
