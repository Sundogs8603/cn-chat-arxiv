    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了DualMind，这是一个通用性代理，旨在解决当前方法面临的挑战，如过度拟合行为和依赖于特定任务的精细调整。DualMind使用一种新颖的“双阶段”训练策略，模拟了人类学习在世界中行动的方式。模型首先通过针对控制任务定制的自监督目标来学习基本的共同知识，然后通过模仿基于给定提示的行为来学习在不同上下文中做出决策。 DualMind可以处理跨域、场景和具体问题，并仅使用单组模型权重来执行零样本提示，而不需要任务特定的精细调整。我们通过广泛的实验在MetaWorld和Habitat上评估了DualMind，并证明其相较于之前的技术具有更好的泛化性能，在Habitat和MetaWorld上的表现分别超过了其他通用性代理的50%和70%。",
