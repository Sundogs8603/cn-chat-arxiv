    "translated_abstract": "GPT系列的成功证明了GPT可以从序列中提取一般性信息，从而使得所有下游任务受益。这激发了我们使用预训练模型来探索DNA序列中的隐藏信息。然而，DNA序列分析中的数据和任务需求非常复杂和多样化，因为DNA相关数据包含不同类型的信息，如序列、表达水平等，目前还没有专门针对这些特点设计的模型。因此，我们提出了DNAGPT，这是一个通用的基础模型，它在9个物种的超过100亿个碱基对上进行了预训练，并可以针对任何DNA序列分析任务进行微调。我们的模型可以同时处理或输出DNA序列和数值。此外，我们独特的标记设计允许用户根据自己的任务需求来设计提示，使其适用于任何类型的任务。我们在分类、回归和生成任务上对模型进行了评估。",
