    "translated_abstract": "对于解决优先级事件票据的一个重要方面是高效地使用精细分类来标注这些票据。然而，票据数据通常很复杂，给现代机器学习方法带来了几个独特的挑战：（1）票据既可以由预定义算法的机器生成，也可以由具有不同协议的具有领域专业知识的工程师更新和创建，（2）票据频繁进行修订，通过修改全部或部分票据描述来更新票据状态，（3）票据标注是时间敏感的，需要根据软件和硬件改进的快速生命周期进行知识更新和新的标签。为了解决这些问题，我们介绍了Ticket-BERT，它使用我们提出的票据数据集训练了一个简单但健壮的语言模型来为票据进行标注。实验证明，Ticket-BERT在Azure认知服务上优于基线和最先进的文本分类器。我们进一步将Ticket-BERT封装到一个积极的le...",
