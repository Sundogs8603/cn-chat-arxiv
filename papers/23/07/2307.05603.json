    "abstract": "This paper introduces a local search method for improving an existing program with respect to a measurable objective. Program Optimization with Locally Improving Search (POLIS) exploits the structure of a program, defined by its lines. POLIS improves a single line of the program while keeping the remaining lines fixed, using existing brute-force synthesis algorithms, and continues iterating until it is unable to improve the program's performance. POLIS was evaluated with a 27-person user study, where participants wrote programs attempting to maximize the score of two single-agent games: Lunar Lander and Highway. POLIS was able to substantially improve the participants' programs with respect to the game scores. A proof-of-concept demonstration on existing Stack Overflow code measures applicability in real-world problems. These results suggest that POLIS could be used as a helpful programming assistant for programming problems with measurable objectives.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种利用局部搜索方法改进现有程序在可衡量目标方面的方法。POLIS（Program Optimization with Locally Improving Search）利用程序的结构，通过固定其余行而改进程序的单个行，使用现有的暴力合成算法，并在无法改进程序性能时继续迭代。POLIS在一个由27名参与者组成的用户研究中进行了评估，参与者编写程序以尝试最大化两个单一代理游戏（Lunar Lander和Highway）的得分。POLIS能够在游戏得分方面显着改进参与者的程序。对现有Stack Overflow代码的概念验证演示测量了其在实际问题中的适用性。这些结果表明，POLIS可用作可衡量目标的编程问题的有益编程助手。",
