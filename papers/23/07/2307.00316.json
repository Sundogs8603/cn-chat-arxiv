    "translated_title": "SHARCS: 解释性多模态学习的共享概念空间",
    "translated_abstract": "多模态学习是解决复杂现实世界问题的重要范式，在这种问题中，单个数据模态通常无法准确解决给定的建模任务。虽然各种深度学习方法已经成功地解决了这些挑战，但它们的推理过程通常是不透明的，限制了原则性的可解释跨模态分析和领域专家干预的能力。在本文中，我们介绍了SHARCS（SHARed Concept Space）——一种用于解释性多模态学习的新概念方法。SHARCS从不同的异构模态中学习和映射可解释的概念到一个统一的概念流形，从而产生了语义相似的跨模态概念的直观投影。我们证明了这种方法可以导致固有可解释的任务预测，同时也提高了下游的预测性能。此外，我们还展示了SHARCS可以运行并明显优于其他方法。",
