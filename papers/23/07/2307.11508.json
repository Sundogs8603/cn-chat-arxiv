    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了两个鲁棒性选址问题的模型，针对香港一家主要医院的病房。考虑了三个参数：不确定性水平、不可行容忍度和可靠性水平。然后，研究了两种不确定性，即对称和有界不确定性。因此，考虑了在不确定性下的调度问题，可以通过给定的概率分布函数来表示未知的问题因素。在这方面，Lin, Janak和Floudas（2004）引入了一种新开发的强优化协议。因此，计算机和化学工程领域已经发展了一种考虑通过给定概率分布表示的不确定性的方法。最后，我们的准确优化协议基于一个min-max框架，并且在应用于（MILP）问题时产生了一个具有对不确定数据免疫性的精确解决方案。",
