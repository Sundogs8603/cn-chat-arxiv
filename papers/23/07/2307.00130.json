    "translated_abstract": "信息提取在自然语言处理中起着非常重要的作用，它对于从非结构化文本数据中提取结构化信息的许多NLP应用都是基础性的。启发式搜索和数据驱动学习是两种主流的实现方法。然而，对于文档类型和长度对IE任务的影响却没有得到足够的关注。为了填补这个空白，本研究调查了基于启发式搜索和数据驱动在特定领域和通用文档中执行两个IE任务：命名实体识别（NER）和语义角色标注（SRL）的准确性和泛化能力。我们提出了两个假设：首先，短文档可能会比长文档产生更好的准确性结果；其次，由于训练文档类型的限制，通用文档可能表现出优于领域相关文档的提取结果。我们的研究结果显示没有单一的方法能够展示出超越其他方法的全面优势。",
