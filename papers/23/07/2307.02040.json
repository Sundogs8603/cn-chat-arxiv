    "abstract": "Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a crucial paradigm for training machine learning models on feature-partitioned, distributed data. However, due to privacy restrictions, few public real-world VFL datasets exist for algorithm evaluation, and these represent a limited array of feature distributions. Existing benchmarks often resort to synthetic datasets, derived from arbitrary feature splits from a global set, which only capture a subset of feature distributions, leading to inadequate algorithm performance assessment. This paper addresses these shortcomings by introducing two key factors affecting VFL performance - feature importance and feature correlation - and proposing associated evaluation metrics and dataset splitting methods. Additionally, we introduce a real VFL dataset to address the deficit in image-image VFL scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of cutting-edge VFL algorithms provides valuable insights for future research in the field.",

    "translated_abstract": "垂直联邦学习（VFL）是在特征划分的分布式数据上训练机器学习模型的重要范例。然而，由于隐私限制，很少有公开的真实世界VFL数据集用于算法评估，而这些数据集只代表了有限的特征分布。现有的基准通常采用从全局集合中的任意特征划分导出的合成数据集，这只捕捉到了一部分特征分布，导致算法性能评估不足。本文通过引入影响VFL性能的两个关键因素——特征重要性和特征相关性，并提出相关的评估指标和数据集划分方法，解决了这些问题。此外，我们还引入了一个真实的VFL数据集来弥补图像-图像VFL情景中的不足。我们对尖端VFL算法进行全面评估，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。",
