    "translated_abstract": "随着语音助手的普及，对话搜索在信息检索领域引起了更多的关注。然而，对话搜索中的数据稀疏性问题严重阻碍了监督式对话搜索方法的进展。因此，研究人员更加关注零样本对话搜索方法。然而，现有的零样本方法存在三个主要限制：它们不适用于所有的检索器，它们的有效性缺乏足够的解释性，并且他们无法解决因省略而导致的常见对话歧义。为了解决这些限制，我们引入了一种新颖的零样本查询重构（ZeQR）框架，该框架根据先前的对话上下文重构查询，而无需对话搜索数据的监督。具体来说，我们的框架利用了设计用于机器阅读理解任务的语言模型来明确解决两个常见的歧义：协调和省略。",
