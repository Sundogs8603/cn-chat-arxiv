    "translated_abstract": "使用电子健康记录（EHR）进行药物推荐是具有挑战性的，因为涉及复杂的医疗数据。当前的方法从患者EHR中提取纵向信息以个性化推荐。然而，现有模型常常缺乏足够的患者表示，并忽视了考虑患者药物记录和具体药物之间相似性的重要性。因此，本文提出了一种基于注意力引导的协同决策网络（ACDNet）用于药物推荐。具体而言，ACDNet利用注意力机制和Transformer在全局和局部层面对患者的健康状况和药物记录进行建模。ACDNet还采用协同决策框架，利用药物记录与药物表示之间的相似性来促进推荐过程。在两个大型医疗数据集MIMIC-III和MIMIC-IV上的实验证明了ACDNet的有效性。",
