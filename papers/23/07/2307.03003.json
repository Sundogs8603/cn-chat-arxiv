    "translated_abstract": "信息系统越来越多地利用人工智能（AI）和机器学习（ML）从大量数据中生成价值。然而，ML模型并不完美，可能会产生错误的分类。因此，人机协同（HITL）扩展了ML模型，为难以分类的实例添加了人工审核。本研究认为，持续依赖人类专家处理困难的模型分类会导致人力投入的大幅增加，增加了有限资源的压力。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一个混合系统，创建了人工专家，从之前由人类专家审查过的未知类别的数据实例中学习分类。我们的混合系统评估哪个人工专家适合分类来自未知类别的实例，并自动分配。随着时间的推移，这减少了人力投入，提高了系统的效率。我们的实验表明，我们的方法优于传统的HITL系统。",
