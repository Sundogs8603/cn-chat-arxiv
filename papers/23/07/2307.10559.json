    "translated_abstract": "空中交通管制是一个安全关键的服务系统，要求地面空中交通管制员（ATCo）时刻关注以维持日常航空运营。ATCo的工作负荷可能对运营安全和空域使用产生负面影响。为了避免过载并确保ATCo的可接受工作负荷水平，准确预测ATCo的工作负荷对于采取缓解措施非常重要。在本文中，我们首先对ATCo工作负荷的研究进行了回顾，主要从空中交通的角度。然后，我们简要介绍了与退休ATCo进行人机交互模拟的设置，其中获得了空中交通数据和工作负荷标签。模拟在三种菲尼克斯接近场景下进行，要求人类ATCo自我评估其工作负荷评级（即，低-1到高-7）。进行了初步的数据分析。接下来，我们提出了一个基于图的深度学习框架，结合合规化预测，来对ATCo的工作负荷进行预测。",
