    "translated_abstract": "现有的动作数据集的精细动作分析面临着动作类别不足、细粒度低、模态和任务有限的挑战。本文提出了一种多模态多任务的花样滑冰数据集（MMFS），该数据集是从世界花样滑冰锦标赛中收集而来的。MMFS包括动作识别和动作质量评估，使用RGB、骨骼和11671个视频片段采集了256个类别的动作得分，并包含了空间和时间标签。我们的数据集的关键贡献包括以下三个方面：（1）首次提出了独立的空间和时间分类，以进一步探索精细动作识别和质量评估。(2)MMFS首次引入了骨骼模态用于复杂的精细动作质量评估。(3)我们的多模态和多任务数据集鼓励更多的动作分析模型。为了评估我们的数据集，我们采用了基于RGB和基于骨骼的方法。",
