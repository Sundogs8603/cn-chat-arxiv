    "abstract": "In this paper we examine the problem of valuing an exotic derivative known as the American passport option where the underlying is driven by a L\\'evy process. The passport option is a call option on a trading account. We derive the pricing equation, using the dynamic programming principle, and prove that the option value is a viscosity solution of variational inequality. We also establish the comparison principle, which yields uniqueness and the convexity of the viscosity solution.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一个被称为美国护照期权的奇异衍生品的定价问题，其中的基础资产由一个李维过程驱动。我们使用动态规划原理推导了定价方程，并证明了期权价值是变分不等式的粘滞解。我们还建立了比较原理，从而得到了粘滞解的唯一性和凸性。",
