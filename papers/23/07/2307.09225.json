    "abstract": "The human body DT has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and wellness, but its responsible and effective implementation requires consideration of various factors. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of the human body DT and proposes a five-level roadmap for its development. The roadmap covers the development of various components, such as wearable devices, data collection, data analysis, and decision-making systems. The article also highlights the necessary support, security, cost, and ethical considerations that must be addressed in order to ensure responsible and effective implementation of the human body DT. The proposed roadmap provides a framework for guiding future development and offers a unique perspective on the future of the human body DT, facilitating new interdisciplinary research and innovative solutions in this rapidly evolving field.",
