    "abstract": "Language models pretrained on large collections of tabular data have demonstrated their effectiveness in several downstream tasks. However, many of these models do not take into account the row/column permutation invariances, hierarchical structure, etc. that exist in tabular data. To alleviate these limitations, we propose HYTREL, a tabular language model, that captures the permutation invariances and three more structural properties of tabular data by using hypergraphs - where the table cells make up the nodes and the cells occurring jointly together in each row, column, and the entire table are used to form three different types of hyperedges. We show that HYTREL is maximally invariant under certain conditions for tabular data, i.e., two tables obtain the same representations via HYTREL iff the two tables are identical up to permutations. Our empirical results demonstrate that HYTREL consistently outperforms other competitive baselines on four downstream tasks with minimal pretraini",

    "translated_abstract": "在许多下游任务中，预训练在大量表格数据集上的语言模型都证明了其有效性。然而，许多模型并没有考虑到表格数据中存在的行/列排列不变性、分层结构等。为了缓解这些限制，我们提出了一种名为HYTREL的表格语言模型，通过使用超图来捕捉表格数据的排列不变性和其他三个结构属性——其中，表格单元格构成节点，并且在每行、每列和整个表格中共同出现的单元格被用来形成三种不同类型的超边。我们展示了HYTREL在特定条件下对于表格数据是最大不变的，即，两个表格通过HYTREL获得的表示相同，当且仅当这两个表格在排列上是相同的。我们的实证结果表明，HYTREL在四个下游任务中始终优于其他竞争基线模型，并且只需最少的预训练。",
