    "translated_abstract": "认知逻辑模型描述了智能体如何推理他们的信念以及其他智能体的信念。现有的逻辑通常假设智能体能够完美地推理无界模态深度的命题。我们提出了DBEL，它是S5的扩展，可以模拟只能推理到特定模态深度的智能体。为了支持对智能体深度的明确推理，DBEL包括深度原子Ead（代理人a的深度恰好为d）和Pad（代理人a的深度至少为d）。我们提供了DBEL的完备的公理化。我们扩展了DBEL以支持有深度限制的公开公告，展示了结果DPAL逻辑如何推广公开公告逻辑的标准公理。我们提出了两种替代扩展，并确定了这些扩展有但DPAL没有的两个不可取的特性——遗忘和知识泄漏。我们提供了这些逻辑的公理化以及可满足性和模型检验的复杂性结果。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces an extension of epistemic logic called DBEL, which is tailored for agents with depth limitations. It includes depth atoms to explicitly reason about agent depths and provides a complete axiomatization. The paper also presents DPAL logic and two other extensions, highlighting the undesirable properties of the latter."
