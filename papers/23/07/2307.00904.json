    "abstract": "Purpose: To develop an open-source, fully-automatic deep learning algorithm, DeepGPET, for choroid region segmentation in optical coherence tomography (OCT) data. Methods: We used a dataset of 715 OCT B-scans (82 subjects, 115 eyes) from 3 clinical studies related to systemic disease. Ground truth segmentations were generated using a clinically validated, semi-automatic choroid segmentation method, Gaussian Process Edge Tracing (GPET). We finetuned a UNet with MobileNetV3 backbone pre-trained on ImageNet. Standard segmentation agreement metrics, as well as derived measures of choroidal thickness and area, were used to evaluate DeepGPET, alongside qualitative evaluation from a clinical ophthalmologist. Results: DeepGPET achieves excellent agreement with GPET on data from 3 clinical studies (AUC=0.9994, Dice=0.9664; Pearson correlation of 0.8908 for choroidal thickness and 0.9082 for choroidal area), while reducing the mean processing time per image on a standard laptop CPU from 34.49s (",
