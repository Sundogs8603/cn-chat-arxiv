    "abstract": "Speech-to-speech translation systems today do not adequately support use for dialog purposes. In particular, nuances of speaker intent and stance can be lost due to improper prosody transfer. We present an exploration of what needs to be done to overcome this. First, we developed a data collection protocol in which bilingual speakers re-enact utterances from an earlier conversation in their other language, and used this to collect an English-Spanish corpus, so far comprising 1871 matched utterance pairs. Second, we developed a simple prosodic dissimilarity metric based on Euclidean distance over a broad set of prosodic features. We then used these to investigate cross-language prosodic differences, measure the likely utility of three simple baseline models, and identify phenomena which will require more powerful modeling. Our findings should inform future research on cross-language prosody and the design of speech-to-speech translation systems capable of effective prosody transfer.",

    "translated_abstract": "当前的语音翻译系统在对话目的下的应用支持不足。特别是由于语调转换不当，讲话者意图和立场的细微差别可能会丢失。我们探讨了如何克服这个问题。首先，我们开发了一种数据收集协议，使双语讲话者用另一种语言重新演绎早前对话的话语，并利用此方法收集了一个包含1871个配对话语的英语-西班牙语语料库。其次，我们开发了一个简单的基于欧氏距离的韵律相似度度量，涵盖了广泛的韵律特征。然后，我们利用这些数据研究了跨语言韵律差异，量化了三个简单基准模型的实用性，并确定了需要更强大建模的现象。我们的发现将有助于未来的跨语言韵律研究和设计能够有效进行韵律转换的语音翻译系统的发展。",
