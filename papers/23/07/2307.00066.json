    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的神经预测模型通过有效的模式挖掘和特征表示取得了显著进展。有效学习的前提是收集足够的数据。然而，在时间序列预测中很难获得足够的数据，这限制了神经预测模型的性能。为了缓解数据稀缺的限制，我们设计了一种新的转让架构Sequence Decomposition Adaptation Network（SeDAN），通过将来自跨领域数据集的可迁移知识进行对齐，以提高目标领域的预测性能。重新思考时间序列数据中特征的可迁移性，我们提出了隐式对比分解方法，将原始特征分解为包括季节性和趋势性特征在内的组成部分，这些特征更容易迁移。然后，我们为不同领域中的分解特征设计了相应的自适应方法。具体而言，对于季节性特征，我们进行联合分布适应。",
