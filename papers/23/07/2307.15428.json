    "translated_abstract": "在相同地理区域的两个不同时间获取的一对3D航空LiDAR点云中检测变化是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为空间支持不匹配和获取系统噪声问题。最近的一些尝试基于监督方法来检测点云上的变化，这需要在实际应用中无法获得的大量标记数据。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种无监督方法，包括两个组件：连续形状重建的神经场（NF）和用于分类变化的高斯混合模型。NF提供了一种不依赖于网格的表示方法，可以对不匹配的空间支持进行编码，并可以通过正则化来增加高频细节和减少噪声。在任意空间尺度上比较每个时间戳的重建结果，从而显著提高了检测能力。我们将该方法应用于一组模拟LiDAR点云的基准数据集中。",
