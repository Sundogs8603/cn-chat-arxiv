    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们引入了$\\nu^2$-流方法，这是$\\nu$-流方法对于包含多个中微子的末态的一种扩展。该架构可以原生地为末态中的所有对象类型和多重性组合进行缩放，适用于任何所需的中微子多重性。在$t\\bar{t}$二轻子事件中，与使用最流行的标准解析技术相比，中微子的动量以及它们之间的相关性可以更准确地重建，并且可以找到所有事件的解。推断时间比竞争方法显著更快，并且可以通过在图形处理单元上并行评估来进一步减少。我们将$\\nu^2$-流应用于$t\\bar{t}$二轻子事件，并展示了展开分布中每个箱子的不确定性比标准技术更接近完美中微子重建的性能界限。对于选择的双微分观测量，$\\nu^2$-流可以在每个箱子中提供改进的统计精度。",
