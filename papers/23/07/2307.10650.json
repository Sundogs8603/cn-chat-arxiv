In this paper, we propose a hybrid multimodal approach for session-based recommendation to address these challenges. Our approach combines different modalities, including textual content and item IDs, leveraging the complementary nature of these modalities using CatBoost. To learn universal item representations, we design a language representation-based item retrieval architecture that extracts features from the textual content utilizing pre-trained language models.

    "translated_abstract": "基于会话的推荐技术旨在通过分析过去的交互来捕捉动态用户行为。然而，现有方法严重依赖于历史物品ID序列以提取用户偏好，导致了流行偏见和冷启动问题等挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种混合多模态方法来解决基于会话的推荐中的这些挑战。我们的方法结合了不同的模态，包括文本内容和物品ID，利用CatBoost利用这些模态的互补性。为了学习通用物品表示，我们设计了一种基于语言表示的物品检索架构，利用预训练语言模型从文本内容中提取特征。此外，我们引入了一种新的解耦对比学习方法来增强语言表示的有效性。这种技术解耦了序列表示和物品表示空间，促进双向对齐",
