    "translated_abstract": "由于多智能体强化学习（MARL）具有广泛的应用范围，了解对MARL模型的对抗攻击的影响对于安全应用该模型至关重要。出于这个目的，我们研究了对MARL的对抗攻击的影响。在考虑的设置中，存在一个外部攻击者，他可以在智能体接收到奖励之前修改奖励，或在环境接收到动作之前操纵动作。攻击者的目标是将每个智能体引导到目标策略，或在攻击者选择的某个特定奖励函数下最大化累积奖励，同时最小化对反馈和动作的操纵量。我们首先展示了只进行动作污染攻击和只进行奖励污染攻击的局限性。然后，我们介绍了一种同时进行动作污染和奖励污染的混合攻击策略。我们展示了这种混合攻击策略可以高效地攻击MARL智能体，即使攻击者没有先验信息。",
