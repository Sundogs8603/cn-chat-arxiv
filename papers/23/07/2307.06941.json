    "translated_abstract": "最近，可解释的人工智能（XAI）引起了广泛关注，其中两种最受欢迎的解释类型是特征归因和反事实解释。这两类方法一直在独立地进行研究，而对它们的调和只有少数试图是经验性的。本研究建立了博弈论特征归因（主要关注但不限于SHAP）和反事实解释之间的明确理论联系。通过对基于Shapley值的特征归因和反事实解释进行有效变换，并在一定条件下证明它们实际上是等价的。然后，我们将等价结果扩展到了Shapley值以外的博弈论解概念。此外，通过对等价条件的分析，我们揭示了只简单地使用反事实解释来提供特征重要性的局限性。在三个数据集上进行了定量实验。",

The study also highlights the limitations of using counterfactual explanations alone to provide feature importances."
