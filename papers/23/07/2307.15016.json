    "translated_abstract": "Google的Bard在对话型人工智能领域与OpenAI的ChatGPT成为了强大的竞争对手。值得注意的是，Bard最近已经更新，可以在对话过程中处理文本提示和视觉输入。鉴于Bard在处理文本输入方面的出色表现，我们探索了其在理解和解释由文本问题条件下的视觉数据（图像）方面的能力。这种探索有潜力揭示Bard和其他即将发布的多模式生成模型在解决需要准确的视觉和语言理解的复杂计算机视觉问题时的新见解和挑战。具体而言，在这项研究中，我们专注于15个不同的任务场景，包括常规、伪装、医学、水下和遥感数据，全面评估了Bard的性能。我们的主要发现表明，Bard在这些视觉场景中仍然存在困境，突显了在基于视觉的理解方面存在的重要差距。",
