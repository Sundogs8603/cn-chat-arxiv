However, most real-world mechanisms give students an incentive to be strategic and misreport their preferences. In this paper, we provide an identification approach for causal effects of school assignment on future outcomes that accounts for strategic misreporting. Misreporting may invalidate existing point-identification approaches, and we derive sharp bounds for causal effects that are robust to strategic behavior. Our approach applies to any mechanism as long as there exist placement scores and cutoffs that characterize that mechanism's allocation rule. We use data from a deferred acceptance mechanism that assigns students to more than 1,000 university-major combinations in Chile. Students behave strategically because the mechanism in Chile constrains the number of majors that students submit in their preferences to eight",

    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的中央机构使用分配机制将学生分配到学校，以反映学生的偏好和学校的优先权。然而，大多数现实世界的机制会给学生提供一种策略性并误报他们的偏好的激励。在本文中，我们提供了一种识别因果效应的方法，该方法考虑了策略性的误报。误报可能使现有的点识别方法无效，我们推导出对策略行为鲁棒的因果效应的尖锐边界。我们的方法适用于任何机制，只要存在描述该机制分配规则的配对分数和截点。我们使用智利一个延迟接受机制的数据，该机制将学生分配到1000多个大学专业组合。学生出于策略考虑而行动，因为智利的机制限制了学生在偏好中提交的专业数量为八个。",
