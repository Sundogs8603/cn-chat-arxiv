    "translated_abstract": "研究和应用已将人工智能与人类团队协作作为一种新的范式来发展人工智能系统。人工智能与人类团队协作认识到人工智能将作为一名队友而不仅仅是工具与人类协作。有效的人工智能与人类团队需要能够充分利用人类和人工智能的独特能力，同时克服每个成员的已知挑战和限制，增强人类能力，并将联合性能提高到任何实体之上。2023年全国人工智能研究和战略计划更新认识到，主要关注人工智能系统独立性能的研究计划往往未考虑到人工智能在动态、适应性和协作团队环境中必须提供的功能，并呼吁进一步研究人工智能与人类团队协作。然而，人们对于人工智能是否能作为人类的队友存在争议。主要的关注点在于采用\"协作\"范式是否与人类的认知过程相矛盾。",
    "tldr": "本研究介绍了将人工智能与人类团队协作作为一种新的发展范式的方法，强调有效的人工智能与人类团队需要充分利用双方的独特能力，同时克服挑战和限制，提高联合表现。同时，该研究指出现有研究往往未考虑到动态、适应性和协作团队环境中人工智能的功能，呼吁加强关于人工智能与人类团队协作的研究。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study introduces a new development paradigm that emphasizes the effective collaboration between AI and human teams. It highlights the need for leveraging the unique abilities of both parties, overcoming challenges and limitations, and enhancing joint performance. The study also calls for further research on AI's functionality within dynamic, adaptive, and collaborative team contexts."
