    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的主动学习方法，考虑了临床试验环境中非独立同分布（non-i.i.d.）的结构。临床试验分为回顾性和前瞻性两种类型。回顾性临床试验在治疗后分析数据；前瞻性临床试验在治疗进行时收集数据。传统的主动学习方法通常假设数据集是独立同分布的（i.i.d.），选择训练样本时忽略了临床试验中数据间的依赖关系。因此，我们提出了前瞻性主动学习方法来克服传统主动学习方法的局限，并将其应用于光学相干断层扫描（OCT）图像中的疾病检测，通过对图像收集时间的条件约束来强制执行i.i.d.假设。我们将我们的方法与传统的主动学习范式进行了比较。",
