    "abstract": "Synthetic time series are often used in practical applications to augment the historical time series dataset for better performance of machine learning algorithms, amplify the occurrence of rare events, and also create counterfactual scenarios described by the time series. Distributional-similarity (which we refer to as realism) as well as the satisfaction of certain numerical constraints are common requirements in counterfactual time series scenario generation requests. For instance, the US Federal Reserve publishes synthetic market stress scenarios given by the constrained time series for financial institutions to assess their performance in hypothetical recessions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series usually penalize training loss to enforce constraints, and reject non-conforming samples. However, these approaches would require re-training if we change constraints, and rejection sampling can be computationally expensive, or impractical for complex constraints.",

    "translated_abstract": "合成时间序列经常在实际应用中用于增加历史时间序列数据集，以提高机器学习算法的性能，放大稀有事件的发生，并创建由时间序列描述的反事实情景。分布相似性（我们称之为真实性）以及满足一定数值约束是反事实时间序列场景生成请求中常见的要求。例如，美联储发布了给定约束时间序列的合成市场压力情景，供金融机构评估其在假设性衰退中的表现。现有的生成约束时间序列的方法通常通过对损失函数进行惩罚来强制满足约束，并拒绝不符合约束的样本。然而，如果我们改变约束条件，这些方法需要重新训练，而拒绝抽样可能在计算上是昂贵的，或者在复杂约束条件下是不切实际的。",
