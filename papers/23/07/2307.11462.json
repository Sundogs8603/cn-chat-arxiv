    "abstract": "This paper studies the error metric selection for long-term memory learning in sequence modelling. We examine the bias towards short-term memory in commonly used errors, including mean absolute/squared error. Our findings show that all temporally positive-weighted errors are biased towards short-term memory in learning linear functionals. To reduce this bias and improve long-term memory learning, we propose the use of a temporally rescaled error. In addition to reducing the bias towards short-term memory, this approach can also alleviate the vanishing gradient issue. We conduct numerical experiments on different long-memory tasks and sequence models to validate our claims. Numerical results confirm the importance of appropriate temporally rescaled error for effective long-term memory learning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that quantitatively analyzes different errors' memory bias towards short-term memory in sequence modelling.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了序列建模中长期记忆学习的错误度量选择。我们检查了常用错误度量（包括平均绝对/平方误差）对短期记忆的偏向。我们的发现表明，在学习线性函数时，所有时间上有正权重的错误都偏向于短期记忆。为了减少这种偏差并改善长期记忆学习，我们提出了使用时间上重新缩放的错误。除了减少对短期记忆的偏向外，这种方法还可以缓解梯度消失问题。我们在不同的长期记忆任务和序列模型上进行数值实验，以验证我们的假设。数值结果确认了适当的时间上重新缩放误差对于有效的长期记忆学习的重要性。据我们所知，这是第一篇定量分析序列建模中不同错误对短期记忆偏向的工作。",
