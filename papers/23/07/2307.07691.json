    "abstract": "The problem of change detection in images finds application in different domains like diagnosis of diseases in the medical field, detecting growth patterns of cities through remote sensing, and finding changes in legal documents and contracts. However, this paper presents a survey on core techniques and rules to detect changes in different versions of a document image. Our discussions on change detection focus on two categories -content-based and layout-based. The content-based techniques intelligently extract and analyze the image contents (text or non-text) to show the possible differences, whereas the layout-based techniques use structural information to predict document changes. We also summarize the existing datasets and evaluation metrics used in change detection experiments. The shortcomings and challenges the existing methods face are reported, along with some pointers for future research work.",

    "translated_abstract": "图像中的变化检测问题在医学领域的疾病诊断、通过遥感发现城市的增长模式以及检测法律文件和合同中的变化等不同领域中都有应用。本文介绍了在文档图像的不同版本中检测变化的核心技术和规则的调查。我们主要讨论了基于内容和基于布局的两种变化检测方法。基于内容的技术智能提取和分析图像内容（文本或非文本），以显示可能的差异，而基于布局的技术使用结构信息来预测文档的变化。我们还总结了在变化检测实验中使用的现有数据集和评估指标。报告了现有方法面临的不足和挑战，并提出了一些未来研究工作的指导。",
