    "abstract": "This paper examines the influence of climate change on the human mind and culture from the 13th century to the 21st century. By quantitatively analyzing 100,000 paintings and the biological data of over 2,000 artists, an interesting U-shaped pattern in the lightness of paintings was found, which correlated with trends in global temperature. Event study analysis revealed that when an artist is subjected to a high-temperature shock, their paintings become brighter in later periods. Moreover, the effects are more pronounced in art genres that rely less on real things and more on the artist's imagination, indicating the influence of artists' minds. Overall, this study demonstrates the significant and enduring influence of climate on the human mind and culture over centuries.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了气候变化对人类思维和文化的影响，时间跨度从13世纪到21世纪。通过对10万幅绘画作品和2000多位艺术家的生物数据进行定量分析，发现了绘画明亮度的一种有趣的U型模式，与全球温度趋势相关。事件研究分析发现，当艺术家遭受高温冲击时，他们的作品在后期变得更加明亮。此外，这种影响在更多依赖艺术家想象力而非现实事物的艺术流派中更加明显，表明了艺术家思维的影响。总体而言，本研究证明了气候对人类思维和文化的显著和持久影响。",
