    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯分散数据融合中的一个关键挑战是“谣言传播”或“重复计数”现象，即先前发送的数据会返回给发送者。通常使用近似方法如协方差交集（CI）来解决此问题，它通过对估计值的加权平均来计算边界。问题是这个边界并不紧实，即估计往往过于保守。本文通过利用多智能体分散融合问题中的概率独立结构，展示了通过使用（i）CI算法的扩展，它使用多个（非整体的）加权因子而不是原始CI中的一个（整体的）因子，以及（ii）一个通用优化方案，能够计算最佳边界并充分利用任意依赖结构，来找到更紧实的边界。我们比较了我们的方法并展示它们在一个简单问题上收敛到相同的解。然后我们在实际问题上测试了我们新的非整体CI算法。",
