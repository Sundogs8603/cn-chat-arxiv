    "translated_abstract": "生成式人工智能的发展可以通过更易于理解的数学知识来提升。除了人工智能聊天以外，大型语言模型（LLM）也在编程、算法发现和定理证明方面得到应用，但它们在基因组学应用方面的局限性较大。本项目引入了数学智能体和数学嵌入作为“数学摩尔定律”的新进展，使用基于GPT的工作流将文献中的方程转换为LaTeX和Python格式。虽然存在许多数字方程表示方法，但缺乏自动化的大规模评估工具。LLM对于人工智能聊天提供了语言用户界面，并为大规模的AI辅助计算基础设施提供了形式化语言。鉴于无限的形式可能空间，与数学互动的数学智能体有可能使我们从“大数据”转向“大数学”。数学与自然语言不同，具有可以通过证明来验证的特性，使其在应用范围上更加广泛。",
