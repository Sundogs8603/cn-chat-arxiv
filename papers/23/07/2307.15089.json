    "translated_abstract": "肺癌是癌症死亡的主要原因。预计2023年将有超过238,340例新的肺癌患者，其中有超过127,070例死亡。选择正确的治疗方案是提高存活率和改善患者生活质量的重要因素。癌症治疗可能引发副作用，这些毒副反应会引起不同的健康问题，影响患者的生活质量。因此，在保持或提高治疗效果的同时减少治疗副作用是临床角度要追求的重要目标。另一方面，临床指南包括癌症治疗建议的一般知识，以协助临床医生。尽管他们根据癌症疾病方面和个体患者特征提供治疗建议，但并未提供基于治疗结果的统计分析。因此，需要对临床指南与治疗结果进行比较。",
    "tldr": "该论文研究了在数据集中通过信息提升的方法进行子群发现。具体针对肺癌治疗，在保持或提高治疗效果的同时减少副作用对于改善患者的生活质量非常重要，临床指南虽然提供了治疗建议，但仍未将治疗结果纳入考量。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates subgroup discovery using information gain in datasets. Specifically, it focuses on lung cancer treatment and highlights the importance of reducing side effects while maintaining or improving effectiveness to enhance patient's quality of life. It also points out the limitation of clinical guidelines in considering treatment outcomes."
