To address this issue, there is a need to continuously record exam sessions to monitor students for suspicious activities.

    "translated_abstract": "考试是学习过程中至关重要的一部分，学术机构投入大量资源维护其完整性，防止学生或监考员作弊。然而，作弊在考试中变得猖獗，这损害了考试的完整性。依靠监考员监视每个学生的传统方法不切实际且无效。为解决这个问题，需要连续记录考试过程以监控学生的可疑活动。然而，这些录像通常过长以至于监考员无法有效分析，疲劳可能导致他们错过重要细节。为扩大监控范围，监考员可以使用固定架设在高处或佩戴的摄像头。本文介绍了一个利用自动化分析视频并有效高效地检测考试中可疑活动的框架。我们利用OpenPose框架和卷积神经网络(CNN)识别学生交换的",
