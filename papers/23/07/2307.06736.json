    "translated_abstract": "时间序列预测由于其广泛的应用和固有的挑战性而受到了广泛的关注。研究的挑战在于识别历史序列中的有效模式，并将其应用于未来的预测。基于点对点连接的多层感知机和Transformer架构的先进模型具有强大的拟合能力，但其辅助计算复杂度限制了实用性。此外，这些结构固有地破坏了时间顺序，降低了信息利用率，并使预测过程解释性降低。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种预测模型MPR-Net。它首先使用卷积运算自适应地分解多尺度历史序列模式，然后基于模式重现的先验知识构建一种模式扩展预测方法，最后使用反卷积运算将未来模式重建为未来序列。通过利用时间依赖性，MPR-Net能够有效地捕捉时间序列中的重要模式并实现可解释的预测。",
