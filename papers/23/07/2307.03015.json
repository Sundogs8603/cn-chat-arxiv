    "translated_abstract": "在扩大机器人围绕动态障碍物的导航时，存在两个主要挑战：障碍物的复杂交互动力学很难通过分析建模，而规划和控制的复杂性随障碍物数量的增加呈指数级增长。因此，在这种情况下，数据驱动和基于学习的方法尤为有价值。然而，数据驱动方法对分布漂移敏感，使得在不同障碍物密度下训练和推广学习模型变得困难。我们提出了一种新颖的顺序神经控制屏障模型（SNCBFs）的组合学习方法，以实现可扩展性。我们的方法利用了一个重要观察：多个动态障碍物的空间交互模式可以通过每个障碍物的状态的时间序列进行分解和预测。通过分解，我们可以将仅针对少量障碍物训练的控制策略推广到障碍物密度可以是100倍的环境中。",
