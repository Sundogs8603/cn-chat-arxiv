    "translated_abstract": "机器人解决方案，特别是机器人臂，在与人类进行密切合作的情况下越来越频繁地部署，例如在制造或家庭护理环境中。这些机器人臂需要用户控制多个自由度（DoFs）来执行任务，主要涉及抓取和操作物体。标准输入设备主要具有两个DoFs，需要耗时且认知负荷大的模式切换来选择单个DoFs。现代自适应DoF映射控制（ADMCs）已经显示可以减少必要的模式切换次数，但尚未能显著降低感知工作负荷。用户仍然承担将抽象模式切换纳入工作流程的心理负担。我们通过提供前馈多模态反馈，使用ADMC的更新建议，使用户能够实时视觉比较当前和建议的映射，从而解决了这个问题。",
