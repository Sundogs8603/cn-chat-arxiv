    "abstract": "Large medical imaging datasets can be cheaply and quickly annotated with low-confidence, weak labels (e.g., radiological scores). Access to high-confidence labels, such as histology-based diagnoses, is rare and costly. Pretraining strategies, like contrastive learning (CL) methods, can leverage unlabeled or weakly-annotated datasets. These methods typically require large batch sizes, which poses a difficulty in the case of large 3D images at full resolution, due to limited GPU memory. Nevertheless, volumetric positional information about the spatial context of each 2D slice can be very important for some medical applications. In this work, we propose an efficient weakly-supervised positional (WSP) contrastive learning strategy where we integrate both the spatial context of each 2D slice and a weak label via a generic kernel-based loss function. We illustrate our method on cirrhosis prediction using a large volume of weakly-labeled images, namely radiological low-confidence annotations,",

    "translated_abstract": "大型医学影像数据集可以通过低置信度的弱标签（例如放射学评分）进行廉价快速的注释。而高置信度的标签（如基于组织学的诊断）很少且昂贵。预训练策略，如对比学习方法，可以利用未标记或弱标注的数据集。然而，这些方法通常需要较大的批处理大小，这在大型3D图像的全分辨率情况下存在困难，因为GPU内存有限。尽管如此，关于每个2D切片的空间上下文的体积信息对于某些医学应用非常重要。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种高效的弱监督定位对比学习策略，通过使用通用基于核的损失函数将每个2D切片的空间上下文和弱标签进行整合。我们通过使用大量弱标签图像（即放射学低置信度标注）来说明我们的方法在肝硬化预测中的应用。",
