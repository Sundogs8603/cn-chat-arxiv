    "abstract": "Liquidity providers are currently incentivised to provide liquidity through the LP Incentives Programme on dYdX. Based on the various parameters makerVolume, depths and spreads, they are rewarded accordingly based on their activities. Given the maturity of the BTC and ETH markets, alongside other altcoins which enjoy a consistent amount of liquidity, this paper aims to update the formula to encourage more active and efficient liquidity, improving the overall trading experience. In this research, I begin by providing a basic understanding of spread management, before introducing the methodology with the various metrics and conditions. This includes gathering orderbooks on a minute interval and reconstructing the depths based on historical trades to establish an upper bound. I end off by providing recommendations to update the maxSpread parameter and alternative mechanisms/solutions to improve the existing market structures.",

    "translated_abstract": "目前，通过dYdX的LP Incentive计划，流动性提供者被激励提供流动性。根据makerVolume、depths和spreads等各种参数，他们根据自己的活动得到相应的奖励。鉴于BTC和ETH市场的成熟度，以及其他享有一定流动性的山寨币，本文旨在更新公式，以鼓励更活跃和高效的流动性，改善整体交易体验。在这项研究中，我首先提供了对价差管理的基础理解，然后介绍了各种指标和条件的方法论。这包括按分钟间隔收集订单簿，并基于历史交易重建深度以建立上限。最后，我提供了更新maxSpread参数和改进现有市场结构的替代机制/解决方案的建议。",
