    "translated_abstract": "在关键应用（如医疗保健）中，确保深度学习模型的稳健性至关重要。尽管最近在体积医学图像分割模型方面取得了进展，但由于其易受对抗攻击的弱点，这些模型无法立即用于实际应用。我们提出了一种用于体积医学图像分割模型的三维频域对抗攻击，并展示了其相对于传统输入或体素域攻击的优势。利用我们提出的攻击，我们引入了一种新颖的频域对抗训练方法，以优化针对体素和频域攻击的稳健模型。此外，我们提出了频率一致性损失来调节我们的频域对抗训练，以在清洁样品和对抗样本之间取得更好的平衡。代码可公开访问https://github.com/asif-hanif/vafa。",
