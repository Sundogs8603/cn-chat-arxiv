    "abstract": "The consumption of podcast media has been increasing rapidly. Due to the lengthy nature of podcast episodes, users often carefully select which ones to listen to. Although episode descriptions aid users by providing a summary of the entire podcast, they do not provide a topic-by-topic breakdown. This study explores the combined application of topic segmentation and text summarisation methods to investigate how podcast episode comprehension can be improved. We have sampled 10 episodes from Spotify's English-Language Podcast Dataset and employed TextTiling and TextSplit to segment them. Moreover, three text summarisation models, namely T5, BART, and Pegasus, were applied to provide a very short title for each segment. The segmentation part was evaluated using our annotated sample with the $P_k$ and WindowDiff ($WD$) metrics. A survey was also rolled out ($N=25$) to assess the quality of the generated summaries. The TextSplit algorithm achieved the lowest mean for both evaluation metrics ",

    "translated_abstract": "播客媒体的消费量正在迅速增加。由于播客节目的冗长性质，用户常常会仔细选择要听的节目。虽然节目描述通过提供整个播客的摘要来帮助用户，但它们并没有提供逐个主题的细分。本研究探讨了利用主题分割和文本摘要方法相结合的应用，以研究如何提高播客节目的理解能力。我们从Spotify的英语播客数据集中选择了10个节目，并使用TextTiling和TextSplit进行了分割。此外，我们应用了三种文本摘要模型，分别是T5、BART和Pegasus，为每个片段提供一个非常简短的标题。我们使用我们的标注样本使用了$P_k$和WindowDiff ($WD$)两个度量来评估分割部分。我们还进行了一项调查（$N=25$），以评估生成的摘要的质量。TextSplit算法在两个评估指标的平均值上都达到了最低水平。",
