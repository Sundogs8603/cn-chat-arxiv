When dealing with data streams, data normalization becomes especially challenging since we may not know in advance the properties of the features, such as their minimum/maximum values, and these properties may change over time. We compare the accuracies generated by eight well-known distance functions in data streams without normalization, normalized considering the statistics of the first batch of data received, and considering the previous batch received. We argue that experimental protocols for streams that consider the full stream as normalized are unrealistic and can lead to biased and poor results. Our results indicate that using the original data stream without applying normalization, and the Canberra distance, can be a good combination when no information about the data stream is known beforehand.",

    "translated_abstract": "数据规范化是建模分类系统时的重要任务。在处理数据流时，由于可能无法预先了解特征的属性（如最小/最大值），且这些属性可能会随时间变化，因此数据规范化变得尤为具有挑战性。我们比较了八种著名的距离函数在没有规范化的数据流中生成的准确度，以及考虑到接收到的第一批数据的统计信息和考虑到上一批数据的规范化。我们认为将全流程视为规范化的实验协议是不现实的，并会导致偏倚和糟糕的结果。我们的结果表明，当事先不了解数据流的信息时，使用原始数据流而不应用规范化，以及使用Canberra距离，可能是一个好的组合。",
