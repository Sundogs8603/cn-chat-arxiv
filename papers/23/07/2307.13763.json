    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的非参数密度估计方法，该方法是基于正则化密度的 Sobolev 范数。这种方法与核密度估计有明显差异，可以清晰解释模型的偏差。虽然我们无法得到相关核函数的闭合解析形式，但我们证明可以通过采样进行近似。决定密度的优化问题是非凸的，标准的梯度方法效果不好。然而，我们证明在适当的初始化和使用自然梯度的情况下，可以得到性能良好的解。最后，虽然该方法提供的是非归一化的密度，无法使用对数似然进行交叉验证，但我们证明可以采用基于 Fisher 散度的分数匹配方法来解决这个问题。我们在最近的异常检测基准套件 ADBench 上评估了得到的方法，并发现它在超过15个算法中排名第二。",
