    "translated_abstract": "通常，视网膜血管分割建立在使用台式设备采集的基于图像的数据集上。静态图像自然丧失了视网膜波动的动态特性，导致数据集的丰富性降低，而台式设备的使用进一步限制了数据集的可扩展性，因为其受限的可访问性。考虑到这些限制，我们首次利用便携设备进行数据获取，引入了第一个基于视频的视网膜数据集。该数据集包括从四个不同诊所收集的635个基于智能手机的眼底视频，涉及415名50至75岁的患者。它在空间和时间维度上提供了视网膜结构的全面和精确的标注，旨在推进血管分割的发展。具体而言，该数据集提供三个层次的空间标注：用于整体视网膜结构描绘的二值血管掩膜、用于区分静脉和动脉的常规静脉-动脉掩膜，以及...",
