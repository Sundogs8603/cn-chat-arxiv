    "translated_abstract": "事件日志被广泛用于记录高科技系统的状态，因此日志异常检测对于监控这些系统非常重要。大多数现有的日志异常检测方法将日志事件计数矩阵或日志事件序列作为输入，利用日志事件之间的定量和/或顺序关系来检测异常。然而，仅考虑定量或顺序关系可能导致检测准确性较低。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了一种基于图的无监督日志异常检测方法，称为Logs2Graphs，它首先将事件日志转换为带属性、有向和加权的图，然后利用图神经网络进行图级别的异常检测。具体而言，我们提出了一种全新的图神经网络模型One-Class Digraph Inception Convolutional Networks（OCDiGCN），用于在一组带属性、有向和加权的图中检测图级别的异常。通过将图表示与属性表示耦合起来，在图级别上进行异常检测的同时提供了对异常的解释能力。",
