    "translated_abstract": "信息提取（IE）是自然语言处理中的重要领域。然而，对于传统分段方法在句子分类和命名实体识别任务中的复杂互动，目前研究尚不充分。本研究提出了一个综合分析方法，将句子分类和命名实体识别结合起来，旨在揭示和理解这两个信息提取子任务之间的相互增强效应。为了实现这个目标，我们引入了一个句子分类和命名实体识别多任务（SCNM）方法，结合了句子分类（SC）和命名实体识别（NER）。我们为SCNM开发了一个句子到标签生成（SLG）框架，并构建了一个包含SC和NER的维基百科数据集。通过格式转换器统一输入格式，使用生成模型生成SC标签、NER标签和相关文本段落。我们提出了一种新的神经网络模型，应用于日语句子分类和命名实体识别的任务，该模型利用了相互增强效应。",
