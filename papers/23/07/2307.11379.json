    "translated_abstract": "机器学习被广泛用于具有社会影响的决策，如银行贷款审核、刑事判决和简历筛选。如何在维持效用的同时确保公正性是一个具有挑战性但至关重要的问题。公正性是一个复杂且依赖于上下文的概念，有超过70种不同的测量指标。由于现有的规定通常对使用哪个指标模糊不清，并且不同的组织可能偏好不同的公正性指标，因此有必要通过综合手段来改善公正性。现有的缓解技术通常针对特定的公正性指标，并且在同时改进多个公正性概念方面存在局限性。在这项工作中，我们提出了CFU（Comprehensive Fairness-Utility），一种基于强化学习的框架，以有效改善机器学习分类器中的公正性-效用权衡。",
