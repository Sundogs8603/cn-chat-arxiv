    "translated_abstract": "物理信息神经网络（PINNs）已经成为一种强大的工具，可以提供对偏微分方程（PDEs）解的稳健准确的近似。然而，在尝试近似具有支配性双曲特性的PDEs时，PINNs面临严重困难和挑战。本研究侧重于开发一种物理信息深度学习框架，用于近似解非线性PDEs，这些PDEs可以在不具有任何先验知识的情况下产生冲击或间断。该框架受到有限元法的启发，该方法在离散化域中求解节点处的解值，并使用这些节点值获得全局定义的解场。基于间断Galerkin方法的严格数学基础，该框架自然处理边界条件（Neumann / Dirichlet），熵条件和正则性要求。进行了多个数值实验。",
