    "abstract": "Recent literature argues the decline in real interest rates led to significant increases in economic profits and markups. Consequently, some have linked rising market power to inflation. We scrutinize the effect of time series sensitivity on estimating secular trends through two relevant examples: increasing market power perceived as rising markups and the influence of corporate profits on inflation. Our analysis reveals that a four-year shift in sample start dates significantly affects economic profit growth trends, accounting for 19% of the trend, or $3,000 per worker in 2014. Likewise, our qualitative evidence suggests that increased corporate profits are unlikely to drive inflation.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的文献认为实际利率下降导致经济利润和加价显著增长。因此，有人认为市场力量的增强与通胀有关。我们通过两个相关的例子，即被视为加价上涨的市场力量增加和企业利润对通胀的影响，审视了时序敏感性对估计长期趋势的影响。我们的分析表明，样本起始日期发生四年偏移会显著影响经济利润增长趋势，占趋势的19%，或者2014年每名工人3000美元。同样，我们的定性证据表明，增加的企业利润不太可能推动通胀。",
    "tldr": "这项研究通过分析市场力量和企业利润对通胀的影响，发现实际利率下降导致经济利润和加价显著增长，但企业利润对通胀的影响较小。",
