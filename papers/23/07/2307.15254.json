    "translated_abstract": "全切片图像（WSI）分类通常被形式化为多示例学习（MIL）问题。由于阳性组织仅占了吉比像素WSI的一小部分，现有的MIL方法直观地侧重于通过注意力机制识别显著实例。然而，这导致偏向易于分类的实例，忽视了难以分类的实例。一些文献揭示了困难示例对于准确建模边界是有益的。通过将这一思想应用到实例级别，我们详细阐述了一种新的MIL框架，即带有掩码困难实例挖掘的MIL（MHIM-MIL），它使用一个共享学习结构（教师-学生）和一致性约束来探索潜在的困难实例。使用基于注意力分数的多个实例掩码策略，MHIM-MIL采用动量教师来隐式挖掘用于训练学生模型的困难实例，学生模型可以是任何基于注意力的MIL模型。这个反直觉的策略对于提高分类性能是至关重要的。",

The framework explores potential hard-to-classify instances using a shared learning structure and consistency constraint, and trains the student model by implicitly mining these instances with a momentum teacher, leading to improved classification performance."
