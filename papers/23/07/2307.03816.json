    "abstract": "We study the online learnability of hypothesis classes with respect to arbitrary, but bounded, loss functions. We give a new scale-sensitive combinatorial dimension, named the sequential Minimax dimension, and show that it gives a tight quantitative characterization of online learnability. As applications, we give the first quantitative characterization of online learnability for two natural learning settings: vector-valued regression and multilabel classification.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了假设类别对任意但有界损失函数的在线可学习性。我们提出了一个新的尺度敏感的组合维度，称为顺序极小极大维度，并证明它能够紧密定量地刻画在线可学习性。作为应用，我们给出了对两个常见学习场景的在线可学习性的首个定量刻画：向量值回归和多标签分类。",
