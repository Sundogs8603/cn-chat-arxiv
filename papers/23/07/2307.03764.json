Our analyses indicate that Mahsa Amini's death triggered polarized Persian language discourse where both fractions of negative and positive tweets toward gender equality increased.

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过对波斯语Twitter话语的计算分析，旨在估算马莎·阿米尼在警方拘留期间去世后对性别平等立场的转变。我们提出了一个集成主动学习流程来训练一个立场分类器。我们的创新在于伊朗女性以主动的角色参与在构建这个人工智能系统中的标注。我们的标注者不仅提供标签，还提供有价值的关键词以进行更有意义的语料库创建，并提供简短的示例文档以进行引导式抽样。我们的分析结果表明，马莎·阿米尼的死亡引发了极化的波斯语话语，对性别平等的负面和积极推文数量都增加了。积极推文的增加略大于负面推文的增加。我们还观察到，就账号创建时间而言，与政府对齐的Twitter账号和支持抗议的Twitter账号之间存在差异。",
