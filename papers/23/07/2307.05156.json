With this done, we discuss the deontic meaning of this reconstruction and show how to build from argumentation neighborhood structures for deontic logic where this notion of explanation can be characterised.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了如何在形式论证的背景下表达在可侵犯逻辑中已经发展的稳定解释概念。在此基础上，我们讨论了这种重建的德义含义，并展示了如何基于论证邻域结构构建德义逻辑的解释概念。此外，该文还提供了一些直接的复杂性结果。",

The key contribution is showing how to characterize this notion of explanation by building from argumentation neighborhood structures for deontic logic."
