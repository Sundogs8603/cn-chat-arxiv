In this work, we propose Curvature-based Transformer to improve the ability of Graph Transformer neural network models to extract structural information on molecular graph data by introducing Discretization of Ricci Curvature. To embed the curvature in the model, we add the curvature information of the graph as positional Encoding to the node features during the attention-score calculation.

    "translated_abstract": "分子性质的预测是基于人工智能的药物设计领域中最重要且具有挑战性的任务之一。在当前主流的方法中，用于训练DNN模型的最常用特征表示基于SMILES和分子图，尽管这些方法简洁高效，但也限制了对空间信息的捕捉能力。在本研究中，我们提出了基于曲率的变压器，通过引入 Ricci 曲率离散化，改进了图变压器神经网络模型在分子图数据上提取结构信息的能力。为了将曲率嵌入模型中，在注意力得分计算期间，我们将图的曲率信息作为位置编码添加到节点特征中。这种方法可以在不改变原始网络结构的情况下，将曲率信息引入图数据，并且有潜力扩展到其他模型。我们进行了实验证明了这种方法的有效性。",
