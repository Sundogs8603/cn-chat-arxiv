In this work, we investigate how the release of ChatGPT changed human-generated open data on the web by analyzing the activity on Stack Overflow, the leading online Q\\&A platform for computer programming. We find that relative to its Russian and Chinese counterparts, where access to ChatGPT is limited, and to similar forums for mathematics, where ChatGPT is less capable, activity on Stack Overflow significantly decreased.

    "translated_abstract": "类似ChatGPT的大型语言模型可以高效地为用户提供各种主题的信息，成为搜索网络和在线求助的潜在替代品。但由于用户与模型进行私下交互，这些模型可能大幅减少公开可用的人工生成数据和知识资源。这种替代可能给未来模型的训练数据获取带来重大问题。在这项工作中，我们通过分析Stack Overflow的活动情况（这是计算机编程领域领先的在线问答平台），研究了ChatGPT发布如何改变了网络上的人工生成开放数据。我们发现相对于俄罗斯和中国的类似平台（因为ChatGPT的访问受限）以及数学相关论坛（ChatGPT能力较弱），Stack Overflow的活动显著减少。差分中差分模型估计Stack Overflow的每周帖子数量减少了16％。这个效应在...",
