    "translated_abstract": "高空间分辨率的风场数据对于气候、海洋和气象研究中的各种应用至关重要。由于风数据往往具有非高斯分布、高空间变异性和异质性，因此对具有两个维度速度的双变量风场进行大规模空间插值或下缩放是一项具有挑战性的任务。在空间统计学中，常用cokriging来预测双变量空间场。然而，cokriging预测器除了对高斯过程有效外，并不是最优的。此外，对于大型数据集，cokriging计算量巨大。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为双变量深度克里金的方法，它是一个由空间径向基函数构建的空间相关的深度神经网络(DNN)和嵌入层，用于双变量空间数据预测。然后，我们基于自助法和集成DNN开发了一种无分布不确定性量化方法。我们提出的方法优于传统的cokriging方法。",
