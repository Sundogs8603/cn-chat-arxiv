    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）和自然语言处理中的性别偏见引起了广泛关注，因为它可能对社会认知和偏见产生影响。这篇研究旨在分析大型语言模型（LLMs）中的性别偏见，重点比较了GPT-2和GPT-3.5这些著名语言模型，以更好地理解其影响。通过全面的文献综述，该研究考察了现有关于AI语言模型中性别偏见的研究，并确定了当前知识的空白。研究方法包括收集和预处理GPT-2和GPT-3.5的数据，并运用深入的定量分析技术评估生成文本中的性别偏见。研究结果揭示了这些大型语言模型输出中存在的具有性别色彩的词语关联、语言使用和偏见叙述。讨论部分探讨了性别偏见的伦理影响以及其对社会认知的潜在后果。",
