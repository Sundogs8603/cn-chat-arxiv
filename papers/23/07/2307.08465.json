    "translated_abstract": "第一类切比雪夫多项式长期以来被用于在解决各种技术问题中逼近实验数据。本研究在切比雪夫多项式分解的框架下，分析了8家捷克企业股份的动态：CEZ A.S. (CEZP), Colt CZ Group SE (CZG), Erste Bank (ERST), Komercni Banka (BKOM), Moneta Money Bank A.S. (MONET), Photon (PENP), Vienna insurance group (VIGR)。投资者在购买证券时往往采用启发式方法做决策，不能直接观察到方差和相关性。利用证券交换价值时间序列的分解向量可以更有效地分析证券交换价值的动态，尤其当其不符合正态分布定律时。所提出的模型可以在不计算方差和相关性的情况下分析证券投资组合的交换价值动态。",
