    "translated_abstract": "垂直联合学习（VFL）使得具有共同用户集合的多个参与方能够在不分享私有数据的情况下训练机器学习模型。由于其可解释性和效率，基于树结构的模型在VFL中变得流行起来。然而，树型VFL的脆弱性尚未得到充分的研究。本研究首先引入了一种新颖的标签推断攻击方法ID2Graph，该攻击利用每个节点（即实例空间）分配的记录标识集合来推导私有训练标签。ID2Graph攻击生成训练样本的图结构，从图中提取社区，并使用社区信息对局部数据集进行聚类。为了抵御实例空间中的标签泄露，我们提出了一种有效的防御机制ID-LMID，该机制通过关注互信息正则化来防止标签泄露。在各种数据集上进行的综合实验表明，ID2Graph攻击呈现出显著的泄露问题。",
