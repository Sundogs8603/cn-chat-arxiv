    "translated_abstract": "在过去几年中，大型语言模型取得了显著的进展。然而，它们要么是通用的，要么是领域特定的，将社区划分为不同的群体。在本文中，我们将这些大型语言模型统一到一个更大的地图中，将通用的和特定的模型连接在一起，并根据用户的个人输入和来自互联网的信息相互改进。将多个大型语言模型链接在一起的思想受到了人类大脑功能的启发。大脑皮层上的特定区域对于某些低层次功能是特定的。而这些区域可以共同工作，实现更复杂的高层功能。人类大脑皮层上的这种行为为设计包含全局、领域和用户级模型的多层大型语言模型提供了新思路。用户级模型在本地机器上运行，以实现高效的响应并保护用户的隐私。这样的多层模型可以减少计算资源的消耗。",
