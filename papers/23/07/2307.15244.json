    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，由于在社交网络、金融风险管理和流量分析等领域中的关键应用，图异常检测 (GAD) 越来越受到关注。现有的GAD方法可以根据被检测的图对象的类型将其分类为节点和边异常检测模型。然而，这些方法通常将节点和边异常视为独立的任务，忽视了它们在现实世界图中的关联和频繁共现。因此，它们无法利用节点和边异常提供的互相检测的互补信息。此外，最先进的GAD方法，如CoLA和SL-GAD，在对比学习中严重依赖负对采样，这导致高计算成本，限制了它们在大规模图中的可扩展性。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一种基于自助式自监督学习的新型统一图异常检测框架，命名为BOURNE。",
