    "translated_abstract": "主成分分析（PCA）是数据降维领域中的关键工具，对于各种数据科学问题都非常有用。然而，许多应用涉及到具有不同数据源的噪声特性导致质量不均匀的异质数据。处理这种混合数据集的方法被称为异方差方法。当前的方法如HePPCAT假设基础系数为高斯分布，但在实践中可能不成立。其他方法如加权PCA（WPCA）假设噪声方差已知，但在实践中很难确定。本文开发了一种PCA方法，可以估计样本的噪声方差，并将这些信息用于模型中，以改进与数据的低秩结构相关的子空间基础的估计值。这样做不需要对低秩成分进行分布假设，也不需要假设噪声方差已知。模拟实验显示了其有效性。",
