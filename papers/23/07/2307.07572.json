    "translated_abstract": "相位关联是根据其起源地震分组地震波到达的任务。它是地震数据处理流程中的基本任务，但对于较小、高速率的地震事件来说是具有挑战性的，这些事件携带有关地震动力学的基本信息，尤其是在常常假定不准确的波速模型下。因此，大多数关联方法都专注于发生率较低且容易关联的较大事件，尽管微地震活动提供了井下弹性介质属性的宝贵描述。在本文中，我们展示了即使在波速未知的情况下，也可以以比以前报告的更高的速率进行关联。我们提出了Harpa，这是一种高速率地震相位关联方法，利用深度神经场构建波速和相关走时的生成模型，并首先解决联合时空源定位和波速恢复问题，然后进行相位关联。",
