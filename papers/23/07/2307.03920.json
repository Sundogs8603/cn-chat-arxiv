    "translated_abstract": "物理知识神经网络（PINNs）是机器学习中的新兴研究领域，将某个给定数据集所描述的物理定律（如偏微分方程）结合到神经网络的训练中。PINNs中，神经网络用作PDE的解近似器，而PDE作为先验知识指导神经网络的训练，以应对训练数据有限的情况下实现神经网络的泛化性能。然而，由于损失函数由神经网络和物理定律两部分组成，训练PINNs是一项非常复杂的任务。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于多任务优化（MTO）范式的新PINN训练框架。在该框架下，除了给定的（主）任务外，还创建了多个辅助任务并一起解决，通过自适应地传递求解一个任务中获得的有用知识，来辅助求解主任务。",
