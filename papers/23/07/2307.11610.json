    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱嵌入（KGE）的重点是将知识图谱（KG）中的实体和关系表示为连续的向量空间，这可以用于预测缺失的三元组以实现知识图谱完整性（KGC）。然而，KGE模型通常只是简单地学习三元组数据的结构关联，并且在现实世界的KG中，嵌入可能会被微不足道的模式和噪声链接所误导。为了解决这个问题，我们在因果性和嵌入解缠方面建立了KGE的新模式。我们进一步提出了Causality-enhanced knowledge graph Embedding（CausE）框架。CausE使用因果干预来估计混杂嵌入的因果效应，并设计新的训练目标来进行稳定预测。实验结果表明，CausE可以优于基线模型，并实现最先进的KGC性能。我们在https://github.com/zjukg/CausE上发布了我们的代码。",
