    "translated_abstract": "LLM已经显示出在众包任务中复制人类行为的潜力，而这些任务以前被认为只有人类才能完成。然而，目前的研究主要集中在简单的原子任务上。我们探索LLM是否可以复制更复杂的众包流水线。我们发现现代LLM可以模拟某些众包工作者在这些“人类计算算法”中的能力，但成功的程度是可变的，并受到请求者对LLM能力的理解、子任务所需的特定技能以及执行这些子任务的最佳交互方式的影响。我们反思了人类和LLM对指示的不同敏感性，强调为LLM提供面向人类的安全保障的重要性，并讨论了训练具有互补技能的人类和LLM的潜力。关键是，我们展示了复制众包流水线提供了一个有价值的平台来研究LLM在不同任务上的相对优势（通过交叉验证",
