Specifically, we give an $\\varepsilon$-differentially private clustering mechanism for the $k$-means objective under continual observation. This is the first approximation algorithm for that problem with an additive error that depends only logarithmically in the number $T$ of updates. The multiplicative error is almost the same as non privately.

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在$\\mathbb{R}^d$中进行隐私聚类的问题，该问题在数据集中插入和删除点。具体来说，我们提供了一个在持续观察下的$\\varepsilon$-差分隐私聚类机制，用于 $k$-means 目标。这是该问题的第一个近似算法，其增加的误差仅以更新次数 $T$ 的对数依赖性。乘法误差与非隐私情况几乎相同。为此，我们展示了如何在持续观察中进行维度缩减，并将其与用于 $k$-means 的差分隐私贪心逼近算法相结合。我们还部分地将我们的结果推广到 $k$-median 问题上。",

The algorithm has logarithmic dependence on the number of updates and achieves similar multiplicative error as the non-private case."
