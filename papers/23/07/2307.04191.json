    "abstract": "The logistic regression model is one of the most popular data generation model in noisy binary classification problems. In this work, we study the sample complexity of estimating the parameters of the logistic regression model up to a given $\\ell_2$ error, in terms of the dimension and the inverse temperature, with standard normal covariates. The inverse temperature controls the signal-to-noise ratio of the data generation process. While both generalization bounds and asymptotic performance of the maximum-likelihood estimator for logistic regression are well-studied, the non-asymptotic sample complexity that shows the dependence on error and the inverse temperature for parameter estimation is absent from previous analyses. We show that the sample complexity curve has two change-points (or critical points) in terms of the inverse temperature, clearly separating the low, moderate, and high temperature regimes.",

    "translated_abstract": "逻辑回归模型是噪声二元分类问题中最常见的数据生成模型之一。本文研究了在标准正态协变量下，以$\\ell_2$误差为限，估计逻辑回归模型参数的样本复杂度，考虑了维度和逆温度的影响。逆温度控制了数据生成过程中的信噪比。虽然逻辑回归的广义界限和渐近性能已经有了深入研究，但关于参数估计的非渐近样本复杂度在之前的分析中没有讨论其与误差和逆温度的依赖关系。我们展示了样本复杂度曲线在逆温度方面具有两个转折点（或临界点），明确划分了低、中和高温度区域。",
