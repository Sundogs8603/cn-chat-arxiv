    "abstract": "We present Scaff-PD, a fast and communication-efficient algorithm for distributionally robust federated learning. Our approach improves fairness by optimizing a family of distributionally robust objectives tailored to heterogeneous clients. We leverage the special structure of these objectives, and design an accelerated primal dual (APD) algorithm which uses bias corrected local steps (as in Scaffold) to achieve significant gains in communication efficiency and convergence speed. We evaluate Scaff-PD on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving fairness and robustness while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our results suggest that Scaff-PD is a promising approach for federated learning in resource-constrained and heterogeneous settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种名为Scaff-PD的快速和高效通信的分布式学习算法。我们的方法通过优化一系列针对异构客户端的分布鲁棒目标来改善公平性。我们利用这些目标的特殊结构，并设计了一个加速的原始-对偶（APD）算法，该算法使用修正偏差的局部步骤（如Scaffold）以在通信效率和收敛速度方面取得显著的提升。我们在多个基准数据集上评估了Scaff-PD，并展示了其在提高公平性和鲁棒性方面的有效性，同时保持竞争性的准确性。我们的结果表明，Scaff-PD是在资源受限和异构环境中进行分布式学习的一种有前景的方法。",
