    "translated_abstract": "链接预测是图机器学习中关键的任务，具有各种应用。我们探索了节点属性和图拓扑之间的相互作用，并证明了将预训练节点属性纳入链接预测模型可以提高其泛化能力。我们提出的方法UPNA（节点属性的无监督预训练）通过学习一个函数，该函数接受一对节点属性并预测边的概率，来解决归纳链接预测问题，相对于图神经网络（GNN），GNN在具有幂律度分布的图中容易受到拓扑快捷方式的影响。通过这种方式，UPNA学习到了潜在的图生成机制的重要部分，因为所学函数可以用于将新节点添加到正在增长的图中。通过利用预训练的节点属性，我们克服了观测偏差，并对未观测节点做出有意义的预测，超过了现有技术的表现（在基准上提升了3倍到34倍）。",
