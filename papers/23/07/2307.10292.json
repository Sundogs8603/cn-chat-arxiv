    "abstract": "In the interdisciplinary field of artificial intelligence (AI) the problem of clear terminology is especially momentous. This paper claims, that AI debates are still characterised by a lack of critical distance to metaphors like 'training', 'learning' or 'deciding'. As consequence, reflections regarding responsibility or potential use-cases are greatly distorted. Yet, if relevant decision-makers are convinced that AI can develop an 'understanding' or properly 'interpret' issues, its regular use for sensitive tasks like deciding about social benefits or judging court cases looms. The chapter argues its claim by analysing central notions of the AI debate and tries to contribute by proposing more fitting terminology and hereby enabling more fruitful debates. It is a conceptual work at the intersection of critical computer science and philosophy of language.",

    "translated_title": "语言迷宫：对人工智能话语中术语使用的建设性批评",
    "translated_abstract": "在跨学科的人工智能（AI）领域中，术语明确性的问题尤为重要。本文认为，AI的讨论仍然缺乏对诸如“训练”、“学习”或“决策”等隐喻的批判性距离。因此，关于责任或潜在用途的反思被严重扭曲。然而，如果相关决策者相信AI可以发展“理解”或正确“解释”问题，那么它在决定社会福利或审判案件等敏感任务时的常规使用将会出现。本章通过分析AI辩论的核心概念来支持其观点，并通过提出更合适的术语来促进更富有成果的辩论。它是一项在批判性计算机科学和语言哲学之间交叉的概念性工作。",
