    "translated_abstract": "多样化的健康数据（物联网、电子健康记录和临床调查）与可扩展的适应性人工智能相结合，已经实现了对疼痛状态的身体、行为和心理社交指标的发现。尽管以技术进步改变医疗系统的热情和承诺，但临床疼痛评估中的人工智能应用受到了问题本身的多样性和个性化以及公平性等其他挑战的阻碍。研究表明，许多人工智能（如机器学习或深度学习）模型显示出偏见，并歧视特定人群（如基于性别或种族），这引起了医疗专业人员对人工智能适应性的怀疑。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于多属性公平损失的CNN模型，旨在考虑数据中包含的任何敏感属性，并公平预测患者的疼痛状态，同时尽量减少差异。",
