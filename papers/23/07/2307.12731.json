    "abstract": "I present the Yule-Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem for linear instrumental variables estimation of a multiple regression model that is either exactly or overidentified. I show that with linear instrumental variables estimation: (a) coefficients on endogenous variables are identical in full and partial (or residualized) regressions; (b) residual vectors are identical for full and partial regressions; and (c) estimated covariance matrices of the coefficient vectors from full and partial regressions are equal (up to a degree of freedom correction) if the estimator of the error vector is a function only of the residual vectors. While estimation of the full model uses the full set of instrumental variables, estimation of the partial model uses the residualized version of the same set of instrumental variables, with residualization carried out, with respect to the set of exogenous variables. I also trace the historical and analytical development of the theorem and suggest that it be renamed as t",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了线性工具变量估计的Yule-Frisch-Waugh-Lovell定理，适用于多元回归模型的恰好识别和过度识别情况。通过线性工具变量估计，本文得出以下结论：(a) 内生变量的系数在完全回归和部分（或残差化）回归中是相同的；(b) 残差向量在完全回归和部分回归中是相同的；(c) 在估计误差向量的估计器仅为残差向量的函数的情况下，完全回归和部分回归的系数向量的协方差矩阵相等（修正了自由度）。在完全模型的估计中，使用了完整的工具变量集合，而在部分模型的估计中，使用了相同工具变量集合的残差化版本，残差化是针对外生变量集合进行的。本文还追溯了该定理的历史和分析发展，并建议将其改名为t",
