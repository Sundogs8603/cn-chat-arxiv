    "abstract": "Speech is a fundamental means of communication that can be seen to provide two channels for transmitting information: the lexical channel of which words are said, and the non-lexical channel of how they are spoken. Both channels shape listener expectations of upcoming communication; however, directly quantifying their relative effect on expectations is challenging. Previous attempts require spoken variations of lexically-equivalent dialogue turns or conspicuous acoustic manipulations. This paper introduces a generalised paradigm to study the value of non-lexical information in dialogue across unconstrained lexical content. By quantifying the perceptual value of the non-lexical channel with both accuracy and entropy reduction, we show that non-lexical information produces a consistent effect on expectations of upcoming dialogue: even when it leads to poorer discriminative turn judgements than lexical content alone, it yields higher consensus among participants.",

    "translated_abstract": "语音是一种基本的沟通方式，可以看作为传递信息提供了两种信道：词汇信道是指所说的词汇，非词汇信道是指说话的方式。这两种信道都会塑造听众对即将到来的沟通的期望，然而直接量化它们对期望的相对影响是具有挑战性的。先前的尝试需要通过词汇等效的对话转变或明显的声学处理来实现。本文提出了一个广义的范式，用于研究对话中非词汇信息的价值，包括不受限制的词汇内容。通过使用准确度和熵减少量化非词汇信道的知觉价值，我们发现非词汇信息对即将到来的对话产生了一致的影响：即使它导致较词汇内容单独时更差的区分性转变判断，仍然得到了参与者之间更高的共识。",
