Deep generative models are appealing for PSF deconvolution because they can infer a posterior distribution over candidate images that, if convolved with the PSF, could have generated the observation. However, classical deep generative models such as VAEs and GANs often provide inadequate sample diversity. As an alternative, we propose a classifier-free conditional diffusion model for PSF deconvolution of galaxy images.

    "translated_abstract": "望远镜捕捉到的图像具有特定的点扩散函数(PSF)。推断在具有更锐利PSF的情况下图像的样貌，即PSF反褪色问题，是不逆问题，因为PSF卷积不是可逆转换。深度生成模型在PSF反褪色中具有吸引力，因为它们可以推断出一个候选图像的后验分布，该分布在与PSF卷积后可能产生观测结果。然而，传统的深度生成模型(如VAE和GAN)通常不能提供足够的样本多样性。作为替代方案，我们提出了一种基于分类器的无条件扩散模型来进行星系图像的PSF反褪色。我们证明，与条件VAE相比，这种扩散模型捕捉到了更多可能的反褪色样本多样性。",
