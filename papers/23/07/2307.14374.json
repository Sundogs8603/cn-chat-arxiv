    "translated_abstract": "本研究提供了从2019年1月至2023年2月的行业特定的每日二氧化碳（CO2）排放的全面时间序列分析。研究重点关注欧洲国家（EU27和英国、意大利、德国、西班牙）和印度的电力、工业、陆地交通、国内航空和国际航空部门，利用碳监测研究计划的近实时活动数据。为了识别常规排放模式，由于COVID-19大流行病造成的破坏性影响，该研究排除了2020年的数据。然后，研究通过主成分分析（PCA）确定了CO2排放的主要贡献者。分析结果显示，电力、工业和陆地交通部门在数据集中占据了相当大的变异。为了进一步的分析，使用了7天移动平均数据集来进行稳健的预测。该数据集捕捉到了短期和长期趋势，并增强了预测质量。",
