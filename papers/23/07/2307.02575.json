    "abstract": "Satellite Earth observations (EO) can provide affordable and timely information for assessing crop conditions and food production. Such monitoring systems are essential in Africa, where there is high food insecurity and sparse agricultural statistics. EO-based monitoring systems require accurate cropland maps to provide information about croplands, but there is a lack of data to determine which of the many available land cover maps most accurately identify cropland in African countries. This study provides a quantitative evaluation and intercomparison of 11 publicly available land cover maps to assess their suitability for cropland classification and EO-based agriculture monitoring in Africa using statistically rigorous reference datasets from 8 countries. We hope the results of this study will help users determine the most suitable map for their needs and encourage future work to focus on resolving inconsistencies between maps and improving accuracy in low-accuracy regions.",

    "translated_abstract": "卫星地球观测（EO）可以提供经济实惠和及时的信息来评估作物状况和粮食生产。在非洲，这样的监测系统至关重要，因为那里存在粮食不安全和缺乏农业统计数据的问题。基于EO的监测系统需要准确的农田地图来提供有关农田的信息，但是缺乏数据来确定哪些可用的土地覆盖地图最准确地识别非洲国家的农田。本研究通过使用来自8个国家的统计严谨的参考数据，对11个公开可用的土地覆盖地图进行定量评估和比较，以评估它们在农田分类和基于EO的非洲农业监测中的适用性。我们希望本研究的结果可以帮助用户确定最适合他们需求的地图，并鼓励未来的工作集中解决地图之间的不一致性并提高低精度地区的准确性。",
