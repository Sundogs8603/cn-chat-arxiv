    "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating the roughness of the volatility in a stochastic volatility model that arises as a nonlinear function of fractional Brownian motion with drift. To this end, we introduce a new estimator that measures the so-called roughness exponent of a continuous trajectory, based on discrete observations of its antiderivative. We provide conditions on the underlying trajectory under which our estimator converges in a strictly pathwise sense. Then we verify that these conditions are satisfied by almost every sample path of fractional Brownian motion (with drift). As a consequence, we obtain strong consistency theorems in the context of a large class of rough volatility models. Numerical simulations show that our estimation procedure performs well after passing to a scale-invariant modification of our estimator.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑在随机波动模型中估计波动性的粗糙度，该模型是作为分数布朗运动（带漂移）的非线性函数而产生的。为此，我们引入一个新的估计量，该估计量测量连续轨迹的所谓粗糙指数，基于其原函数的离散观测。我们给出了对于基础轨迹的条件，在这些条件下，我们的估计器以严格路径方式收敛。然后我们验证了这些条件在几乎每个分数布朗运动（带漂移）样本路径中都得到满足。作为结果，在大类粗波动模型的背景下，我们得到了强一致性定理。数值模拟结果表明，在经过我们估计器的尺度不变修改后，我们的估计程序表现良好。",
