    "translated_abstract": "对计算资源和训练数据的有限访问给希望训练和利用预测性机器学习模型的个人和团体带来了重大挑战。尽管存在许多公开可用的机器学习模型，但它们通常没有托管，需要最终用户建立自己的计算基础设施。或者，这些模型可能仅通过付费的基于云的机制访问，这对于公众的一般使用可能是昂贵的。此外，模型和数据提供者需要一种更流畅的方法来跟踪资源使用情况，并从其他人的随后使用中获得资金和其他方面的利益。目前还缺乏一种有效的机制来为改进模型性能贡献高质量的数据。我们提出了一个名为“PredictChain”的基于区块链的市场，用于解决这些问题。这个市场允许用户上传数据集用于训练预测性机器学习模型，请求模型使用并追踪资源的使用情况。",
