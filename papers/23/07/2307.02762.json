    "translated_abstract": "如今，评估和比较不同现代大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的回答质量在自动化方面很难。最近的研究建议并主要使用LLMs作为无参考度量衡开放式问题回答的参考指标。更具体地说，他们以被认为是“最强”的LLM作为评估器，对候选模型的答案进行两两比较并提供排名分数。然而，这种直观的方法存在多个问题，例如带来自我提升（青睐自己的答案）和位置偏见。我们从教育领域（Cho and MacArthur, 2011；Walsh, 2014）中汲取见解和教训，改进了基于LLM的评估。具体而言，我们提出了（1）同行评级（PR）算法，该算法考虑每个同行LLM对所有答案对的两两偏好，并输出模型的最终排名；以及（2）同行讨论（PD），在其中我们促使两个LLMs进行讨论并尝试就两个偏好达成共识。",
