    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了深度强化学习（DRL）在环境、社会和治理（ESG）金融投资组合管理中的应用，特别关注基于ESG评分的市场监管的潜在益处。我们利用了Advantage Actor-Critic（A2C）代理，并使用OpenAI Gym中的环境进行实验，这些环境是从FinRL平台改编的。该研究包括对DRL代理在标准道琼斯工业平均指数（DJIA）市场条件和按公司ESG评分调整回报的情景下的性能进行比较分析。在ESG调控市场中，根据投资组合的回报和ESG评分按比例分配资金，而对于低于指数平均ESG评分的投资组合则征收税款。结果令人惊讶地表明，在ESG调控市场中，DRL代理的表现优于标准DJIA市场设置。此外，我们考虑了将ESG变量纳入模型中的影响。",
