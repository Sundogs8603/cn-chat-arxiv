DeepIPCv2 takes a set of LiDAR point clouds for its main perception input. As point clouds are not affected by illumination changes, they can provide a clear observation of the surroundings no matter what the condition is. This results in a better scene understanding and stable features provided by the perception module to support the controller module in estimating navigational control properly. To evaluate its performance, we conduct several tests by deploying the model to predict a set of driving records and perform real automated driving under three different conditions. We also conduct ablation and comparative studies with some recent models to justify its performance. Based on the experimental results, DeepIPCv2 shows a robust performance by achieving the best drivability in all conditions. C",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了DeepIPCv2，一种利用LiDAR传感器感知环境的自动驾驶模型，以实现更强大的驾驶性能，特别是在光照条件较差的情况下。DeepIPCv2使用一组LiDAR点云作为其主要感知输入。由于点云不受光照变化的影响，它们可以提供清晰的环境观察，无论条件如何。这使得感知模块能够提供更好的场景理解和稳定的特征，从而支持控制模块准确估计导航控制。为了评估其性能，我们通过部署该模型来预测一组驾驶记录并在三种不同条件下进行真实自动驾驶的测试。我们还进行了消融和比较研究，以证明其性能。基于实验结果，DeepIPCv2在所有条件下均显示出强大的驾驶性能。",
