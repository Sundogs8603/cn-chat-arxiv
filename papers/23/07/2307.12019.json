    "abstract": "In e-commerce, head queries account for the vast majority of gross merchandise sales and improvements to head queries are highly impactful to the business. While most supervised approaches to search perform better in head queries vs. tail queries, we propose a method that further improves head query performance dramatically. We propose XWalk, a random-walk based graph approach to candidate retrieval for product search that borrows from recommendation system techniques. XWalk is highly efficient to train and inference in a large-scale high traffic e-commerce setting, and shows substantial improvements in head query performance over state-of-the-art neural retreivers. Ensembling XWalk with a neural and/or lexical retriever combines the best of both worlds and the resulting retrieval system outperforms all other methods in both offline relevance-based evaluation and in online A/B tests.",

    "translated_abstract": "在电子商务中，头部查询占据了绝大部分的销售额，并且对头部查询的改进对业务非常有影响力。虽然大多数监督式的搜索方法在头部查询相对于尾部查询有更好的性能，但我们提出了一种能够极大改善头部查询性能的方法。我们提出了XWalk，一种基于随机游走的图形方法，用于从推荐系统技术中借鉴的产品搜索候选集检索。XWalk在大规模高流量的电子商务环境中训练和推断非常高效，并且在头部查询性能方面显示出了相当大的改进，超过了最先进的神经检索器。将XWalk与神经和/或词汇检索器进行集成，结合了两者的优势，所得到的检索系统在离线相关性评估和在线A/B测试中优于所有其他方法。",
