However, most existing FL approaches rely on a centralized server for global model aggregation, leading to a single point of failure. This makes the system vulnerable to malicious attacks when dealing with dishonest clients. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a secure and reliable FL system based on blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Our system incorporates a peer-to-peer voting mechanism and a reward-and-slash mechanism, which are powered by on-chain smart contracts, to detect and deter malicious behaviors.

    "translated_abstract": "在深度学习时代，联邦学习(FL)提供了一种有前途的方法，允许多家机构数据所有者或客户共同训练机器学习模型，而不会损害数据隐私。然而，大多数现有的FL方法依赖于用于全局模型聚合的集中式服务器，导致单点故障。这使系统在处理不诚实的客户时容易受到恶意攻击。在这项工作中，我们通过提出基于区块链和分布式分类账技术的安全可靠FL系统来解决这个问题。我们的系统结合了点对点投票机制和奖励和惩罚机制，由链上智能合约提供动力，以检测和阻止恶意行为。我们提出了理论和实证分析，以展示所提出方法的有效性，表明我们的框架对恶意客户是强大的。",
