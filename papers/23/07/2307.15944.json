    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究证明了强化学习在实现多机器人协作，尤其是在面临自我利益与集体利益之间的社会困境时的潜力。然而，诸如信息传递不畅和对抗机器人之类的环境因素可能会影响合作，因此必须探索如何操纵多机器人通信以实现不同的结果。本文提出了一种新方法，即PIMbot，通过两种不同形式的操纵（策略和激励操纵）来操纵多机器人协作中的奖励函数。我们的工作为最近的多智能体强化学习社会困境引入了一种新的操纵角度，该角度利用了独特的奖励函数来进行激励。通过利用我们提出的PIMbot机制，机器人能够有效地操纵社会困境环境。PIMbot对任务结果可能产生积极和消极的影响。",
