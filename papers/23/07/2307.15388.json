    "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of big data on deep learning models for full waveform inversion (FWI). While it is well known that big data can boost the performance of deep learning models in many tasks, its effectiveness has not been validated for FWI. To address this gap, we present an empirical study that investigates how deep learning models in FWI behave when trained on OpenFWI, a collection of large-scale, multi-structural datasets published recently. Particularly, we train and evaluate the FWI models on a combination of 10 2D subsets in OpenFWI that contain 470K data pairs in total. Our experiments demonstrate that larger datasets lead to better performance and generalization of deep learning models for FWI. We further demonstrate that model capacity needs to scale in accordance with data size for optimal improvement.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了大数据对全波形反演（FWI）深度学习模型的影响。尽管众所周知，大数据可以提升深度学习模型在许多任务中的性能，但对于FWI的有效性尚未得到验证。为了填补这一空白，我们进行了一项实证研究，研究了在最近发布的大型、多结构数据集OpenFWI上训练的FWI深度学习模型的行为。特别地，我们在OpenFWI的10个2D子集的组合上训练和评估了FWI模型，这些子集总共包含了470K个数据对。我们的实验证明，更大的数据集能够提高FWI深度学习模型的性能和泛化能力。我们进一步证明，模型容量需要根据数据大小进行相应的扩展以获得最佳的改进效果。",
