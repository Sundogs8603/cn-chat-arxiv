    "translated_abstract": "由于深度神经网络在安全关键任务中的广泛应用，深度学习测试引起了越来越多的关注。在测试过程中，通过模糊测试或使用测试指标选择的测试用例被输入模型中，以找到导致故障的测试单元（如神经元和特征图，激活它们几乎肯定会导致模型错误），并将其报告给DNN开发者，随后开发者重新修复它们（例如，使用测试用例重新训练模型）。然而，目前的测试指标主要关注神经元，这意味着通过引导模糊测试或使用这些指标选择发现的测试用例主要集中于检测导致故障的神经元，而忽略了导致故障的特征图。在这项工作中，我们提出了DeepFeature，它从特征图层面对DNN进行测试。当进行测试时，DeepFeature将仔细检查模型中的每个内部特征图，并识别可能存在的漏洞。",
