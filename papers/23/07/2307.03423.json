    "translated_abstract": "高光谱图像（HSI）具有大量反映物质特性的光谱信息，但由于成像技术的限制，其空间分辨率较低。与此相补充的是多光谱图像（MSI），如RGB图像，具有高空间分辨率但光谱波段不足。高光谱和多光谱图像融合是一种以成本效益的方式获取既具有高空间分辨率又具有高光谱分辨率的理想图像的技术。许多现有的HSI和MSI融合算法依赖于已知的成像退化模型，但这些模型在实践中通常不可用。本文提出了一种基于条件去噪扩散概率模型的深度融合方法，称为DDPM-Fus。具体而言，DDPM-Fus包含了逐步向高空间分辨率HSI（HrHSI）添加高斯噪声的前向扩散过程和从噪声版本中学习预测所需HrHSI的逆向降噪过程。",
