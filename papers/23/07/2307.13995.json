    "translated_abstract": "个性化联邦学习（PFL）是一种流行的框架，允许客户端在数据属于不同领域的应用场景中拥有不同的模型。PFL中一个典型客户端的模型包括一个由所有客户端训练的全局编码器，用于从原始数据中提取通用特征，以及使用客户端本地数据训练的个性化层（如分类器）。然而，由于不同客户端之间数据分布的差异（也称为领域差异），全局编码器产生的通用特征主要包括许多与某个特定客户端本地任务无关的组件。最近一些PFL方法通过个性化编码器中的特定参数来解决以上问题。然而，这些方法面临神经网络参数空间高维度和非线性所带来的很大挑战。相比之下，特征空间具有较低的维度，提供更直观的理解。",
