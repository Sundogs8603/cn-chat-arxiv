Properly regulating AI technologies is extremely challenging, as it requires a delicate balance between legal restrictions and technological developments.

Then, drawing from historical lessons, we develop a framework to facilitate a thorough analysis of AI regulation proposals. Finally, we perform a systematic analysis of these AI regulation proposals to understand how each proposal may fail. This study, containing historical lessons and analysis methods, aims to help governing bodies untangling the AI regulatory chaos through a divide-and-conquer manner.",
