    "translated_abstract": "连续时间非线性最优控制问题在实际应用中具有巨大潜力。虽经历了几十年的发展，强化学习（RL）作为一种通用的非线性控制设计方法已取得了巨大的成功。然而，最近对现有的连续时间强化学习（CT-RL）方法进行的全面分析揭示了它们面临重大的设计挑战，包括复杂性、数值条件和维度扩展问题。尽管有先进的理论结果，但现有的ADP CT-RL综合方法在解决即使是小的学术问题时都不足够。因此，本文的目标是介绍一套用于控制仿射非线性系统的新的CT-RL算法。我们的设计方法依赖于两个重要因素。首先，我们的方法适用于可以划分为较小子问题的物理系统。这种构造性的考虑使得问题的维度减少。",
