    "abstract": "Poetry holds immense significance within the cultural and traditional fabric of any nation. It serves as a vehicle for poets to articulate their emotions, preserve customs, and convey the essence of their culture. Arabic poetry is no exception, having played a cherished role in the heritage of the Arabic community throughout history and maintaining its relevance in the present era. Typically, comprehending Arabic poetry necessitates the expertise of a linguist who can analyze its content and assess its quality. This paper presents the introduction of a framework called \\textit{Ashaar} https://github.com/ARBML/Ashaar, which encompasses a collection of datasets and pre-trained models designed specifically for the analysis and generation of Arabic poetry. The pipeline established within our proposed approach encompasses various aspects of poetry, such as meter, theme, and era classification. It also incorporates automatic poetry diacritization, enabling more intricate analyses like automa",

    "translated_abstract": "诗歌在任何国家的文化和传统中都具有极大的重要性。它是诗人表达情感、保留习俗和传达文化精髓的工具。阿拉伯诗歌也不例外，在阿拉伯社区的传统中扮演着珍贵的角色，并在当今时代保持其重要性。通常，理解阿拉伯诗歌需要语言学家的专业知识，他们可以分析其内容并评估其质量。本文介绍了一个名为“Ashaar”的框架，该框架包括一系列用于阿拉伯诗歌分析和生成的数据集和预训练模型。我们提出的方法建立了一个流程，包括诗歌的各个方面，如韵律、主题和时代分类。它还包括自动诗歌音标化，使得可以进行更复杂的分析，如自动生成新的诗歌。",
