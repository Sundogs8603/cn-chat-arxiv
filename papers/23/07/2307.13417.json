    "abstract": "Ambiguity is ubiquitous in natural language. Resolving ambiguous meanings is especially important in information retrieval tasks. While word embeddings carry semantic information, they fail to handle ambiguity well. Transformer models have been shown to handle word ambiguity for complex queries, but they cannot be used to identify ambiguous words, e.g. for a 1-word query. Furthermore, training these models is costly in terms of time, hardware resources, and training data, prohibiting their use in specialized environments with sensitive data. Word embeddings can be trained using moderate hardware resources. This paper shows that applying DBSCAN clustering to the latent space can identify ambiguous words and evaluate their level of ambiguity. An automatic DBSCAN parameter selection leads to high-quality clusters, which are semantically coherent and correspond well to the perceived meanings of a given word.",

    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言中，歧义性普遍存在。解决歧义意义对于信息检索任务尤为重要。尽管词向量携带语义信息，但它们对于处理歧义性并不擅长。Transformer模型已被证明可以处理复杂查询中的词义歧义，但无法用于识别有歧义的单词，例如用于一个单词的查询。此外，训练这些模型在时间、硬件资源和训练数据方面成本高昂，限制了它们在具有敏感数据的专门环境中的使用。词向量可以使用适中的硬件资源进行训练。本文通过将DBSCAN聚类应用于潜空间，可以识别出有歧义的单词并评估其歧义程度。自动DBSCAN参数选择能够得到高质量的聚类，这些聚类在语义上是连贯的，并与给定单词的感知意义相对应。",
