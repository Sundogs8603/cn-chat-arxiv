    "abstract": "We explore the use of uncertainty estimation in the maritime domain, showing the efficacy on toy datasets (CIFAR10) and proving it on an in-house dataset, SHIPS. We present a method joining the intra-class uncertainty achieved using Monte Carlo Dropout, with recent discoveries in the field of outlier detection, to gain more holistic uncertainty measures. We explore the relationship between the introduced uncertainty measures and examine how well they work on CIFAR10 and in a real-life setting. Our work improves the FPR95 by 8% compared to the current highest-performing work when the models are trained without out-of-distribution data. We increase the performance by 77% compared to a vanilla implementation of the Wide ResNet. We release the SHIPS dataset and show the effectiveness of our method by improving the FPR95 by 44.2% with respect to the baseline. Our approach is model agnostic, easy to implement, and often does not require model retraining.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们探讨了在航海领域中使用不确定性估计的方法，并展示了在玩具数据集（CIFAR10）上的功效，并在我们自己的数据集SHIPS上验证了其有效性。我们提出了一种方法，通过使用蒙特卡洛Dropout获得的类内不确定性和异常检测领域的最新发现相结合，以获得更全面的不确定性度量。我们探讨了引入的不确定性度量与其在CIFAR10和实际应用环境中的工作表现之间的关系。我们的工作在没有离群数据训练的模型上将FPR95提高了8％，相比于目前最高性能的工作。相比于常规实现的Wide ResNet，我们的性能提高了77％。我们发布了SHIPS数据集，并通过与基线相比将FPR95提高了44.2％来展示我们方法的有效性。我们的方法适用于各种模型，易于实现，并且通常不需要重新训练模型。",
