    "translated_abstract": "最近，消息传递神经网络（MPNN）为处理分子图提供了一种有前途的工具，并在促进发现和设计具有所需性质的材料方面取得了显著成功。然而，经典的MPNN方法在捕捉分子结构中隐藏的强拓扑信息（如非同构图）方面也存在局限性。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种Simplicial信息传递（SMP）框架，以更好地捕捉分子中的拓扑信息，从而突破了传统信息传递范式的局限。在SMP中，建立了一个广义信息传递框架，用于聚集任意次序的simplicial复合体中的信息，并详细阐述了一个分层结构，允许不同次序的simplices之间的信息交流。我们将SMP框架应用于深度学习体系结构中的量子化学性质预测，并取得了状态。",
