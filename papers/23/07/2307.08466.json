    "translated_abstract": "未被发现的局部放电(PD)是高压(HV)气体绝缘系统(GIS)中的一个安全关键问题。虽然在交流电压下对PD的诊断已经得到了很好的处理，但在直流电压下的PD分析仍然是一个活跃的研究领域。这些研究的重点之一是将不同的PD源进行分类，以便进行后续的复杂分析。在本文中，我们提出并分析了一种基于神经网络的方法，用于对HVDC GIS上绝缘体上的金属突起和导电颗粒引起的PD信号进行分类，而不依赖于脉冲序列分析特征。与之前的方法不同，我们提出的模型可以区分负电位和正电位下获得的研究PD信号，并且能够推广到未见过的操作电压倍数。此外，我们比较了时域和频域输入信号的性能，并研究了不同的归一化方案对减轻自由空间影响的影响。",
