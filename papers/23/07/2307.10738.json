    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习使得多个数据所有者（即联邦学习客户端）能够在不泄露私人数据的情况下进行机器学习模型的协作训练。由于联邦学习服务器每轮训练只能选择有限数量的客户端，客户端选择成为重要的研究问题。现有方法通常关注于提高联邦学习模型性能或提高客户端的公平待遇。在选择联邦学习客户端时平衡性能和公平性考虑的问题仍然存在。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了公平感知的联邦客户端选择（FairFedCS）方法。基于李雅普诺夫优化，它通过同时考虑客户端的声誉、参与联邦学习任务的次数和对最终模型性能的贡献，动态调整联邦学习客户端的选择概率。通过不使用基于阈值的声誉过滤，它为联邦学习客户端提供了赎回声誉的机会。",
