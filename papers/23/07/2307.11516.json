    "abstract": "This paper defines a new approach for augmenting human intelligence with AI for optimal goal solving. Our proposed AI, Indigo, is an acronym for Informed Numerical Decision-making through Iterative Goal-Oriented optimization. When combined with a human collaborator, we term the joint system IndigoVX, for Virtual eXpert. The system is conceptually simple. We envisage this method being applied to games or business strategies, with the human providing strategic context and the AI offering optimal, data-driven moves. Indigo operates through an iterative feedback loop, harnessing the human expert's contextual knowledge and the AI's data-driven insights to craft and refine strategies towards a well-defined goal. Using a quantified three-score schema, this hybridization allows the combined team to evaluate strategies and refine their plan, while adapting to challenges and changes in real-time.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文定义了一种新的方法，通过将人类智慧与人工智能相结合，实现最优目标解决。我们提出的人工智能系统，Indigo，是指通过迭代目标导向优化进行知情数值决策。当与人类协作者结合时，我们将这个联合系统命名为IndigoVX，即虚拟专家。该系统概念简单。我们设想该方法可以应用于游戏或商业策略，人类提供战略背景，而人工智能提供最佳的数据驱动移动。Indigo通过迭代反馈循环运作，利用人类专家的背景知识和人工智能的数据驱动洞见，制定和优化朝着明确定义的目标的策略。使用定量化的三分数模式，这种混合化允许联合团队评估策略并改进计划，同时实时适应挑战和变化。",
