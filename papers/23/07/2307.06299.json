    "translated_abstract": "最近深度神经网络（DNNs）的发展导致了它们在安全关键系统中的应用，从而增加了对其安全性的保证的需求。可以使用由验证社区开发的工具来证明DNN的这些安全性质。然而，这些工具本身容易出现实现错误和数值稳定性问题，这使得它们的可靠性值得怀疑。为了克服这个问题，一些验证器会产生可以由可信检查器检查的结果证明。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种用于DNN验证的新型证明检查器的实现。它通过提供数值稳定性和更大的可验证性来改进现有的实现。为了实现这一点，我们利用了Imandra（一种工业级的定理证明器）的两个关键能力：对无限精度实数算术的支持和其形式化验证基础设施。迄今为止，我们在Imandra中实现了一个证明检查器，规定了其正确性属性和开始",
