    "title": "All-for-One and One-For-All: Deep learning-based feature fusion for Synthetic Speech Detection. (arXiv:2307.15555v1 [cs.SD])",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning and computer vision have made the synthesis and counterfeiting of multimedia content more accessible than ever, leading to possible threats and dangers from malicious users. In the audio field, we are witnessing the growth of speech deepfake generation techniques, which solicit the development of synthetic speech detection algorithms to counter possible mischievous uses such as frauds or identity thefts. In this paper, we consider three different feature sets proposed in the literature for the synthetic speech detection task and present a model that fuses them, achieving overall better performances with respect to the state-of-the-art solutions. The system was tested on different scenarios and datasets to prove its robustness to anti-forensic attacks and its generalization capabilities.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近深度学习和计算机视觉的进步使得多媒体内容的合成和伪造变得更加易于实现，可能引发来自恶意用户的威胁和危险。在音频领域，我们目睹了语音深伪造生成技术的增长，这促使研究合成语音检测算法以应对可能的恶意使用，例如欺诈或身份盗窃。本文考虑了文献中提出的三种不同的特征集，用于合成语音检测任务，并提出了一种融合它们的模型，相比于现有解决方案，其整体性能更好。通过对不同场景和数据集进行测试，证明了该系统对抗反取证攻击的鲁棒性以及其泛化能力。",
