    "translated_abstract": "公共云中的多租户可能导致共享资源的共存干扰，可能导致云应用性能下降。云服务提供商希望在发生此类事件时知道发生的时间以及性能下降的严重程度，以执行干扰感知迁移并缓解问题。然而，基础设施即服务（IaaS）公共云中的虚拟机（VM）对于提供商来说是黑盒子，无法获取应用级性能信息。这使得性能监视变得异常困难，因为云服务提供商只能依赖于低级指标，如CPU使用率和硬件计数器。我们提出了一种新颖的机器学习框架Alioth，用于监视云应用的性能下降。为了为数据密集型模型提供数据，我们首先阐述干扰生成器，并在实验平台上进行全面的共存实验，构建反映现实场景中复杂性和动态性的Alioth数据集。",
