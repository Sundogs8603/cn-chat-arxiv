    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT带来了革命性的社会价值，但也引发了人们对于AI生成内容滥用的担忧。因此，一个重要问题是如何检测出内容是由ChatGPT生成还是人类生成的。现有的检测器是建立在人类生成和AI生成内容之间存在分布差距的假设上的。这些差距通常是通过统计信息或分类器来识别的。我们的研究质疑了检测器中的分布差距假设。我们发现检测器不能有效地区分人类生成和AI生成内容之间的语义和风格差距。相反，\"微小的差异\"，如额外的一个空格，在检测中变得至关重要。基于这一发现，我们提出了SpaceInfi策略来规避检测。实验证明了这种策略在多个基准和检测器上的有效性。我们还对为什么SpaceInfi能成功规避检测提供了理论解释。",
