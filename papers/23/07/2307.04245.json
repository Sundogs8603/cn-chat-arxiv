    "abstract": "Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology finds applications in digitizing books and unstructured documents, along with applications in other domains such as mobility statistics, law enforcement, traffic, security systems, etc. The state-of-the-art methods work well with the OCR with printed text on license plates, shop names, etc. However, applications such as printed textbooks and handwritten texts have limited accuracy with existing techniques. The reason may be attributed to similar-looking characters and variations in handwritten characters. Since these issues are challenging to address with OCR technologies exclusively, we propose a post-processing approach using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools. This work presents an end-to-end pipeline that first performs OCR on the handwritten or printed text and then improves its accuracy using NLP.",

    "translated_abstract": "光学字符识别（OCR）技术在数字化图书和非结构化文档等方面有广泛应用，在移动统计、执法、交通和安全系统等其他领域也有应用。当前的技术在识别车牌、商店名等印刷文字方面表现良好，然而对于印刷教科书和手写文字等应用，现有技术的准确性有限。造成这种问题的原因可能在于形状相似的字符和手写字符的变化。鉴于这些问题在仅使用OCR技术解决时具有挑战性，我们提出了一种使用自然语言处理工具进行后处理的方法。本文介绍了一种端到端的流水线，首先对手写或印刷文本进行OCR，然后使用NLP提高其准确性。",
