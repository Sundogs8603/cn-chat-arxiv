    "translated_abstract": "高分辨率广角鱼眼图像在自动驾驶等机器人应用中变得越来越重要。然而，使用普通的卷积神经网络或视觉变压器处理此类数据存在问题，因为将其投影到平面上的矩形网格时会引入投影和失真损失。我们引入了HEAL-SWIN变压器，它将在天体物理学和宇宙学中使用的高度均匀的层次等面积等纬度像素化（HEALPix）网格与层次移位窗口（SWIN）变压器结合起来，从而得到能够训练高分辨率无失真球面数据的高效灵活模型。在HEAL-SWIN中，HEALPix网格的嵌套结构用于执行SWIN变压器的拼接和窗口操作，从而得到具有最小计算开销的球面数据一维表示。我们展示了我们模型在语义分割上的卓越性能。",
