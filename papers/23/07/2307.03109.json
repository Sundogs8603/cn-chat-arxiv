As LLMs continue to play a vital role in both research and daily use, their evaluation becomes increasingly critical, not only at the task level, but also at the society level for better understanding of their potential risks. Over the past years, significant efforts have been made to examine LLMs from various perspectives. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these evaluation methods for LLMs, focusing on three key dimensions: what to evaluate, where to evaluate, and how to evaluate. Firstly, we provide an overview from the perspective of evaluation tasks, encompassing general natural language processing tasks, reasoning, medical usage, ethics, educations, natural and social sciences, agent applications, and other areas. Secondly, we answer the `where' and `how' questions by diving into the evaluation methods and bench",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）由于在各种应用中表现出的前所未有的性能而在学术界和工业界越来越受欢迎。随着LLMs在研究和日常使用中继续发挥着重要作用，它们的评估变得越来越关键，不仅在任务水平上，而且在社会层面上，以更好地了解它们的潜在风险。在过去的几年里，已经做出了相当大的努力来从不同的角度来研究LLMs。本文综述了LLMs的这些评估方法，重点关注三个关键维度：评估什么、在哪里评估以及如何评估。首先，我们从评估任务的角度提供了一个概述，涵盖了一般的自然语言处理任务、推理、医学应用、伦理学、教育、自然科学和社会科学、代理应用和其他领域。其次，我们通过深入探讨评估方法和基准答案来回答“在哪里”和“如何”这两个问题。",
