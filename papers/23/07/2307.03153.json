    "abstract": "Everyday news coverage has shifted from traditional broadcasts towards a wide range of presentation formats such as first-hand, unedited video footage. Datasets that reflect the diverse array of multimodal, multilingual news sources available online could be used to teach models to benefit from this shift, but existing news video datasets focus on traditional news broadcasts produced for English-speaking audiences. We address this limitation by constructing MultiVENT, a dataset of multilingual, event-centric videos grounded in text documents across five target languages. MultiVENT includes both news broadcast videos and non-professional event footage, which we use to analyze the state of online news videos and how they can be leveraged to build robust, factually accurate models. Finally, we provide a model for complex, multilingual video retrieval to serve as a baseline for information retrieval using MultiVENT.",

    "translated_abstract": "每日新闻报道已从传统的广播转向各种未经编辑的第一手视频素材等多种呈现方式。反映在线上可用的多模态、多语言新闻来源的数据集可以用来教授模型从这种转变中受益，但现有的新闻视频数据集主要关注为英语听众制作的传统新闻广播。我们通过构建 MultiVENT 数据集来解决这个限制，该数据集包含以五种目标语言为基础的多语言、事件为中心的视频，并包括新闻广播视频和非专业活动素材，我们用其来分析在线新闻视频的现状以及如何利用它们来构建强大、准确的模型。最后，我们提供了一个复杂的多语言视频检索模型，以用作使用 MultiVENT 进行信息检索的基线模型。",
