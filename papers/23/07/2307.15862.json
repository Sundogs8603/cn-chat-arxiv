    "translated_abstract": "抑郁症是一种常见的精神健康障碍，会导致持续抑郁的情绪和情感困扰等后果。其中一类抑郁症是隐性抑郁症，患者故意或无意地通过外在乐观主义隐藏真实情感，从而使诊断和治疗变得复杂和延迟，并导致意外自杀。在本文中，我们提出使用面部微表情（FMEs）来检测和识别潜在的真实情感来诊断隐性抑郁症。然而，FMEs的极低强度和微妙的特性使它们的识别成为一项艰巨的任务。我们提出了一种基于面部标志点的关注区域（ROI）方法来解决这一挑战，并描述了一种低成本和保护隐私的解决方案，可以在个人环境（例如在家中）使用便携式移动设备进行自我诊断。我们呈现了验证我们方法的结果和发现，并讨论其他技术挑战和解决方案。",
