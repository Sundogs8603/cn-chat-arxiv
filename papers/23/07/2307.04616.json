Our method integrates both tasks into a unified dual input/output model, leveraging not only facial information but also person image data.

    "translated_abstract": "在自然环境中进行年龄和性别识别是一项极具挑战性的任务：除了条件的可变性、姿势的复杂性和图像质量的变化之外，还存在人脸部分或完全遮挡的情况。我们提出了MiVOLO（多输入VOLO），这是一种使用最新的视觉变换器进行年龄和性别估计的简单方法。我们的方法将两个任务集成到一个统一的双输入/输出模型中，不仅利用了面部信息，还利用了人物图像数据。这提高了我们模型的泛化能力，使其即使在图像中人脸不可见的情况下也能提供令人满意的结果。为了评估我们提出的模型，我们在四个流行的基准测试上进行了实验，并取得了最先进的性能，同时展示了实时处理能力。此外，我们还引入了一个基于Open Images数据集的新基准测试。这个基准测试的真实注释由认真生成。",
