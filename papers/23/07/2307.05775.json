    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络的表达能力通常通过比较一个架构能够区分的非同构图或节点对的数量与$k$-维Weisfeiler-Lehman ($k$-WL)测试能够区分的数量来衡量。本文通过对$k$-WL的可靠性和有效性进行系统分析，揭示了从业者对表达能力和$k$-WL的概念化之间的不一致性。我们进一步进行了对从业者的调查（n=18），以了解他们对表达能力的概念以及对$k$-WL的假设。与从业者的观点相反，我们的分析（借鉴了图论和基准审核）揭示了$k$-WL不能保证等距、可能与现实世界的图任务无关，并且可能不促进泛化或可信度。我们主张基于基准的表达能力的外延定义和测量，进一步贡献了构建此类基准的指导问题。",
