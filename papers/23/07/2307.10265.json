    "abstract": "This article explores the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on scientific research. It highlights ten ways in which AI is revolutionizing the work of scientists, including powerful referencing tools, improved understanding of research problems, enhanced research question generation, optimized research design, stub data generation, data transformation, advanced data analysis, and AI-assisted reporting. While AI offers numerous benefits, challenges such as bias, privacy concerns, and the need for human-AI collaboration must be considered. The article emphasizes that AI can augment human creativity in science but not replace it.",
