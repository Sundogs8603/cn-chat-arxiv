    "translated_abstract": "学习能力组件（LEC）对于自主驾驶车辆（AV）的决策至关重要，但是当面临训练分布之外的样本时，它们很可能做出错误的决策。越界检测器已被提出来检测这类样本，从而充当安全监控，然而，越界检测器和LEC都需要大量使用通常在AV中找到的嵌入式硬件。对于这两个组件，存在非功能和功能性能之间的权衡，两者都会影响车辆的安全性。例如，给越界检测器更长的响应时间可以提高其准确性，但会以LEC的性能为代价。我们考虑一个具有二进制输出的LEC，就像一个自主紧急制动系统（AEBS），并使用风险来模拟两个组件设计参数对彼此的功能性能和非功能性能以及对系统安全性的影响。",
