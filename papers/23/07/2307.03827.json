    "translated_abstract": "深度学习方法在MRI中用于白质病变分割时，当应用于训练数据集之外的扫描仪或中心的数据时，性能会降低。由于当前模型不能直接应用于新机构的数据，这对于转化和广泛应用非常重要。在本研究中，我们评估了几种MRI强度标准化方法作为多中心液体衰减反转恢复（FLAIR）MRI白质病变分割的预处理步骤。我们评估了一种专门用于FLAIR MRI的方法IAMLAB，以及其他常见的标准化技术，如White-strip、Nyul和Z-score。我们提出了一个集成模型，将每个模型的预测结果进行组合。我们训练了一个跳跃连接UNet（SC UNet）模型，使用标准化图像和原始数据进行训练，并在多个维度上评估了分割性能。",
