    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言处理社区中，将文本信息注入知识图谱（KG）实体表示已经成为一个值得探索的领域，以提高KG相关任务的性能。常用的外部知识增强KG嵌入的方法包括语义丰富的依赖解析特征、一组相关关键词，以及来自外部语料库（如维基百科）的完整文本描述。尽管这种创新（文本增强的KG嵌入）取得了一定的进展，但本文提出这种方法可以进一步改进。我们不再使用单一文本描述（因为文本的固有语义歧义无法充分表示一个实体），而是提出了一个多任务框架，既能选择与KG实体相关的一组文本描述，又能将KG嵌入与文本描述进行对齐或增强。与之前将形式化实体描述插入知识库的方法不同，这一方法是提供了对KG嵌入进行增强和对齐的新途径。",
