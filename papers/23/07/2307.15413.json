    "abstract": "Social Media Popularity Prediction has drawn a lot of attention because of its profound impact on many different applications, such as recommendation systems and multimedia advertising. Despite recent efforts to leverage the content of social media posts to improve prediction accuracy, many existing models fail to fully exploit the multiple dependencies between posts, which are important to comprehensively extract content information from posts. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel prediction framework named Dependency-aware Sequence Network (DSN) that exploits both intra- and inter-post dependencies. For intra-post dependency, DSN adopts a multimodal feature extractor with an efficient fine-tuning strategy to obtain task-specific representations from images and textual information of posts. For inter-post dependency, DSN uses a hierarchical information propagation method to learn category representations that could better describe the difference between posts. DSN also exploits ",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体受欢迎程度预测引起了广泛关注，因为它对许多不同应用有着深远的影响，如推荐系统和多媒体广告。尽管最近的一些努力利用社交媒体帖子的内容来提高预测准确性，但许多现有模型未能充分利用帖子之间的多个依赖关系，而这些依赖关系对于全面提取帖子内容信息很重要。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为“依赖感知序列网络（DSN）”的新型预测框架，它同时利用帖子内部依赖和帖子间依赖。对于帖子内部依赖，DSN采用一种多模态特征提取器和高效微调策略，从帖子的图像和文本信息中获取任务特定的表示。对于帖子间依赖，DSN使用一种分层信息传播方法来学习能更好描述帖子之间差异的类别表示。DSN还利用...",
