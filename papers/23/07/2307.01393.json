    "translated_abstract": "计算机模拟，特别是对于复杂的现象，可能需要高性能计算资源。通常，为了理解一个现象，需要运行多个模拟，每个模拟都有不同的模拟输入参数。然后，使用这些数据创建一个插值器或替代模型，将模拟输出与相应的输入相关联。当输入和输出是标量时，简单的机器学习模型就足够了。然而，当模拟输出是以二维或三维空间维度为位置的向量值，并且通常具有时间组件时，创建替代模型就更具挑战性。在本报告中，我们使用一个二维的喷流与高爆炸物相互作用的问题，来理解如何构建高质量的替代模型。我们的数据集特点独特 - 每个模拟产生的向量值输出在超过两百万个空间位置可用；每个模拟运行的时间相对较少。",
