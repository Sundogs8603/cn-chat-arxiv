    "abstract": "The proliferation of discussion about fatherhood in Singapore attests to its significance, indicating the need for an exploration of how fatherhood is framed, aiding policy-making around fatherhood in Singapore. Sound and holistic policy around fatherhood in Singapore may reduce stigma and apprehension around being a parent, critical to improving the nations flagging birth rate. We analyzed 15,705 articles and 56,221 posts to study how fatherhood is framed in Singapore across a range of online platforms (news outlets, parenting forums, Twitter). We used NLP techniques to understand these differences. While fatherhood was framed in a range of ways on the Singaporean online environment, it did not seem that fathers were framed as central to the Singaporean family unit. A strength of our work is how the different techniques we have applied validate each other.",

    "translated_abstract": "新加坡关于父亲身份的讨论激增，表明有必要探索父亲身份的框架，以促进新加坡的父亲政策制定。全面和有效的父亲政策可以减少对成为父母的负面评价和恐惧，对改善国家的出生率至关重要。我们分析了15,705篇文章和56,221个帖子，研究了在新加坡的各种在线平台（新闻媒体、育儿论坛、Twitter）上关于父亲身份的框架。我们使用自然语言处理技术来理解这些差异。尽管在新加坡的在线环境中有多种对父亲身份的解读，但似乎父亲并没有被视为新加坡家庭单位的核心。我们工作的一个优势是应用了不同的技术相互验证。",
