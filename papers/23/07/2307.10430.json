    "abstract": "The generation of synthetic tabular data that preserves differential privacy is a problem of growing importance. While traditional marginal-based methods have achieved impressive results, recent work has shown that deep learning-based approaches tend to lag behind. In this work, we present Differentially-Private TaBular AutoRegressive Transformer (DP-TBART), a transformer-based autoregressive model that maintains differential privacy and achieves performance competitive with marginal-based methods on a wide variety of datasets, capable of even outperforming state-of-the-art methods in certain settings. We also provide a theoretical framework for understanding the limitations of marginal-based approaches and where deep learning-based approaches stand to contribute most. These results suggest that deep learning-based techniques should be considered as a viable alternative to marginal-based methods in the generation of differentially private synthetic tabular data.",

    "translated_abstract": "在保持差分隐私的条件下生成合成表格数据是一个日益重要的问题。虽然传统的基于边际的方法取得了令人瞩目的结果，但最近的研究表明，基于深度学习的方法往往落后。在这项工作中，我们提出了DP-TBART，一种基于Transformer的自回归模型，它在各种数据集上保持差分隐私，并能够与基于边际的方法竞争，甚至在某些场景下超过最先进的方法。我们还提供了一个理论框架，用于理解基于边际的方法的局限性以及深度学习方法在哪些方面能够做出贡献。这些结果表明，在生成差分隐私合成表格数据时，应考虑基于深度学习的技术作为可行的替代方法。",
