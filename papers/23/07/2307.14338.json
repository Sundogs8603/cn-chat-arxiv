    "translated_abstract": "近年来，针对表格数据问题的深度学习模型受到越来越多的关注，而基于梯度提升决策树（GBDT）的算法仍然是一个强大的解决方案。随着自然语言处理和计算机视觉等其他领域的最新趋势，最近提出了几种检索增强的表格深度学习模型。对于给定的目标对象，检索模型从可用的（训练）数据中检索其他相关对象，例如最近邻居，并使用它们的特征甚至标签来进行更好的预测。然而，我们表明，现有的检索增强表格深度学习解决方案与适当调整的简单无检索基线相比，几乎没有或者只有微小的优势。因此，检索增强方法是否值得在表格深度学习中继续探索还不清楚。",
    "tldr": "本研究显示了现有的检索增强表格深度学习解决方案与无检索基线相比几乎没有明显优势，但提出了一种能够充分利用检索增强的表格深度学习模型，解锁了其潜力。",
    "en_tdlr": "This work demonstrates that existing retrieval-augmented tabular deep learning solutions provide little or no advantage over retrieval-free baselines, but proposes a new approach that effectively unlocks the potential of retrieval-augmented tabular deep learning."
