    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become the standard technology for the representation of factual information in applications such as recommendation engines, search, and question-answering systems. However, the continual updating of KGs, as well as the integration of KGs from different domains and KGs in different languages, remains to be a major challenge. What we suggest here is that by a reification of abstract objects and by acknowledging the ontological distinction between concepts and types, we arrive at an ontologically grounded and language-agnostic representation that can alleviate the difficulties in KG integration.",
