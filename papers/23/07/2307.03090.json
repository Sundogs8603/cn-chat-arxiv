    "translated_abstract": "我们在与 Solvency II 要求的市场一致估值框架中研究了人口风险的定量化问题。我们提供了基于队列方法评估保险组合的流入和流出的简洁公式。在这个背景下，我们保持了最高的一般性，以考虑传统保险和股权关联保险：因此，我们提出了对负债的市场一致估值。在第二步中，我们评估了与意外死亡相关的特异风险（称为意外风险）和系统风险（也称为趋势风险）的审慎资本需求，为前者提供了形式封闭的公式，为后者提供了一个算法。我们展示了意外波动率取决于队列保单的固有特性（风险总额）、保单持有人的年龄和保额的变动性；趋势风险既取决于意外波动率，也取决于长期的趋势。",
