    "abstract": "The purpose of multi-object tracking (MOT) is to continuously track and identify objects detected in videos. Currently, most methods for multi-object tracking model the motion information and combine it with appearance information to determine and track objects. In this paper, unfalsified control is employed to address the ID-switch problem in multi-object tracking. We establish sequences of appearance information variations for the trajectories during the tracking process and design a detection and rectification module specifically for ID-switch detection and recovery. We also propose a simple and effective strategy to address the issue of ambiguous matching of appearance information during the data association process. Experimental results on publicly available MOT datasets demonstrate that the tracker exhibits excellent effectiveness and robustness in handling tracking errors caused by occlusions and rapid movements.",

    "translated_abstract": "多目标跟踪的目的是持续跟踪和识别视频中检测到的物体。目前，大多数多目标跟踪方法都是通过建模运动信息并将其与外观信息相结合，来确定和跟踪物体。本文采用了未被伪造的控制方法来解决多目标跟踪中的身份交换问题。我们在跟踪过程中建立了外观信息变化的序列，针对身份交换检测和恢复设计了一个检测和修正模块。我们还提出了一种简单而有效的策略来解决数据关联过程中外观信息模糊匹配的问题。公开可用的多目标跟踪数据集上的实验结果表明，该跟踪器在处理由遮挡和快速运动引起的跟踪错误方面具有出色的效果和鲁棒性。",
