    "abstract": "Over the eight months since its release, ChatGPT and its underlying model, GPT3.5, have garnered massive attention, due to their potent mix of capability and accessibility. While a niche-industry of papers have emerged examining the scope of capabilities these models possess, the information fed to and extracted from these networks has been either natural language text or stylized, code-like language. Drawing inspiration from the prowess we expect a truly human-level intelligent agent to have across multiple signal modalities, in this work we examine GPT3.5's aptitude for visual tasks, where the inputs feature content provided as ASCII-art without overt distillation into a lingual summary. We conduct experiments analyzing the model's performance on image recognition tasks after various transforms typical in visual settings, trials investigating knowledge of image parts, and tasks covering image generation.",

    "translated_abstract": "在发布后的八个月里，由于其强大的能力和易于使用，ChatGPT及其底层模型GPT3.5引起了广泛关注。虽然出现了一批研究这些模型能力范围的论文，但这些网络所接收和提取的信息要么是自然语言文本，要么是类似代码的风格化语言。在这项工作中，我们受到对一个真正达到人类水平的智能代理在多个信号模态上具备的能力的启示，考察了GPT3.5在视觉任务中的能力，其中输入以ASCII-Art形式提供内容，没有明显的语言化总结。我们进行了一系列实验，分析了该模型在经过典型的视觉设置下的图像识别任务上的表现，调查了其对图像部分的知识以及图像生成的任务。",
