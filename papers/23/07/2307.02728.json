    "abstract": "General purpose agents will require large repertoires of skills. Empowerment -- the maximum mutual information between skills and the states -- provides a pathway for learning large collections of distinct skills, but mutual information is difficult to optimize. We introduce a new framework, Hierarchical Empowerment, that makes computing empowerment more tractable by integrating concepts from Goal-Conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. Our framework makes two specific contributions. First, we introduce a new variational lower bound on mutual information that can be used to compute empowerment over short horizons. Second, we introduce a hierarchical architecture for computing empowerment over exponentially longer time scales. We verify the contributions of the framework in a series of simulated robotics tasks. In a popular ant navigation domain, our four level agents are able to learn skills that cover a surface area over two orders of magnitude larger than prior work.",

    "translated_abstract": "通用智能体需要大量的技能。 授权 - 技能和状态之间的最大互信息 - 为学习大量不同技能提供了一条路径，但互信息很难优化。我们介绍了一种新的框架，分层授权，通过集成目标条件层次强化学习的概念，使得计算授权更加可行。我们的框架提供了两个具体的贡献。首先，我们介绍了一种新的变分下界，可用于计算短期视角下的授权。其次，我们引入了一个分层架构，用于计算指数时间尺度下的授权。我们在一系列模拟机器人任务中验证了该框架的贡献。在一个流行的蚂蚁导航领域，我们的四级智能体能够学习覆盖面积比之前的工作大两个数量级的技能。",

The framework is validated in simulated robotics tasks, where four level agents learn skills that cover a surface area over two orders of magnitude larger than previous work."
