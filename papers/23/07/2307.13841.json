    "abstract": "Coordination facilitation and efficient decision-making are two essential components of successful leadership. In this paper, we take an informational approach and investigate how followers' information impacts coordination and efficient leadership in a model featuring a leader and a team of followers. We show that efficiency is achieved as the unique rationalizable outcome of the game when followers possess sufficiently imprecise information. In contrast, if followers have accurate information, the leader may fail to coordinate them toward the desired outcome or even take an inefficient action herself. We discuss the implications of the results for the role of leaders in the context of financial fragility and crises.",

    "translated_abstract": "协调促进和高效决策是成功领导的两个基本组成部分。本文采用信息方法研究了跟随者的信息如何影响协调和高效领导，在一个包含领导者和跟随者的模型中进行调查。我们发现，在跟随者拥有足够不精确的信息时，效率可以作为一种合理的结果实现。相反，如果跟随者有准确的信息，领导者可能无法将他们协调到期望的结果，甚至可能采取低效的行动。我们讨论了结果对金融脆弱性和危机背景下领导者角色的影响。",

The study finds that efficiency can be achieved when followers possess imprecise information, but when followers have accurate information, the leader may struggle to coordinate them and may even take inefficient actions."
