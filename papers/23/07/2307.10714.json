    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑城市驾驶中的群体互动问题。自动驾驶汽车的最新行为规划器主要单独考虑每个代理之间的交互，并通过成本函数找到最优的自我代理行为，例如避免与其他代理发生碰撞。本文提出了一种风险遮挡方法，通过分析三个代理之间的群体互动，去超越单个交互的限制。具体而言，所提出的方法能够确定需要在自我代理的行为规划器中考虑哪个第一个其他代理，因为这个第一个其他代理由于第二个其他代理的阻挡而无法接近自我代理。实验结果表明，将风险遮挡作为上游筛选模块用于行为规划器可以规划出比现有技术更决策和舒适的驾驶策略，前提是在这些情况下确保安全性。所提方法的可用性得到了验证。",
