The BOLD benchmark instantiates the BOLD framework by providing a read-write Linked Data interface to a smart building with simulated time, occupancy movement and sensors and actuators around lighting. On the Linked Data representation of this environment, agents carry out several specified tasks, such as controlling illumination. The simulation environment provides means to check for the correct execution of the tasks and to measure the performance of agents. We conduct measurements on Linked Data agents based on condition-action rules.",
