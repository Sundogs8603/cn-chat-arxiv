    "translated_abstract": "有序特征（OSF）逻辑是一种基于函数表示特征符号和集合表示排序符号的知识表示和推理语言，这些符号在一个包含关系格中排列。 OSF逻辑允许构建类似记录的术语，表示实体类别，并且这些术语本身也按照包含关系排序。这种结构的一致性算法提供了一种高效的类型包含演算，已经应用于计算语言学，并在约束逻辑编程语言（如LOGIN和LIFE）和自动推理器（如CEDAR）中实现。本文将OSF逻辑推广到模糊设置中。我们给出了一个灵活的模糊包含关系的定义，它推广了Zadeh的模糊集包含关系。基于这个定义，我们定义了一个模糊的OSF逻辑语义，其中排序符号和OSF术语表示模糊集合。我们将包含关系扩展到OSF术语，并证明它构成了一个模糊偏序。",
