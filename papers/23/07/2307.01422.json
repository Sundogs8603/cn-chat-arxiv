    "translated_abstract": "尽管马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法（MCMC）为从概率分布中采样提供了一个一般性框架，但当目标分布是高度多模式时，它们往往收敛缓慢。最近，生成流网络（GFlowNets）被提出作为一种替代框架，通过将采样视为序贯决策问题，可以减轻这个问题，当样本具有明确的组合结构时。尽管最初是从流网络的角度引入的，但最近GFlowNets的进一步发展越来越多地受到马尔可夫链文献的启发，完全绕过了流的需求。在本文中，我们形式化了这种联系，并提供了一种使用马尔可夫链的新视角来解释GFlowNets的统一视图，无论状态空间的性质如何，都可以视为是经常换手的马尔可夫链。将GFlowNets定位到与MCMC方法相同的理论框架下，也允许...",
