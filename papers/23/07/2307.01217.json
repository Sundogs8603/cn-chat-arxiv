    "abstract": "Recently, personalized federated learning (pFL) has attracted increasing attention in privacy protection, collaborative learning, and tackling statistical heterogeneity among clients, e.g., hospitals, mobile smartphones, etc. Most existing pFL methods focus on exploiting the global information and personalized information in the client-level model parameters while neglecting that data is the source of these two kinds of information. To address this, we propose the Federated Conditional Policy (FedCP) method, which generates a conditional policy for each sample to separate the global information and personalized information in its features and then processes them by a global head and a personalized head, respectively. FedCP is more fine-grained to consider personalization in a sample-specific manner than existing pFL methods.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，个性化联邦学习（pFL）在隐私保护、协作学习以及解决客户端之间的统计异质性等方面引起了越来越多的关注，例如医院、移动智能手机等。大多数现有的pFL方法侧重于利用客户端级模型参数中的全局信息和个性化信息，但忽略了数据是这两种信息的源头。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了联邦条件策略（FedCP）方法，该方法为每个样本生成一个条件策略，以分离其特征中的全局信息和个性化信息，然后分别通过全局头和个性化头进行处理。与现有的pFL方法相比，FedCP更加细粒度地考虑个性化的样本特定方式。在计算机视觉和自然语言处理领域进行的大量实验表明，FedCP在性能上超过了十一种最先进的方法，最高可提高6.69%。",
