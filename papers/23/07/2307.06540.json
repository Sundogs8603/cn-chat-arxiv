The data, sourced from Baidu's PaddlePaddle AI platform, were meticulously preprocessed, tokenized, and categorized based on sentiment labels. A CNN-based model was utilized, leveraging word embeddings for feature extraction, and trained to perform sentiment classification. The model achieved a macro-average F1-score of approximately 0.73 on the test set, showing balanced performance across positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
