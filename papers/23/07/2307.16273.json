    "translated_abstract": "深度学习的最新进展给人们的生活带来了重大变化。与此同时，这些快速发展引发了人们对深度网络训练过程的合法性的担忧。然而，为了保护不受信任的人工智能开发者的知识产权，通常禁止验证者通过访问模型参数和训练数据来直接检查训练过程。为了应对这个挑战，我们提出了zkDL，一种高效的深度学习训练零知识证明。zkDL的核心是zkReLU，一种专门针对ReLU激活函数的零知识证明协议，具有优化的证明时间和证明大小，这是可验证训练中的一个主要障碍，因为它的非算术性质。为了将zkReLU整合到整个训练过程的证明系统中，我们设计了一种新颖的从神经网络中构建算术电路的方法。通过利用丰富的并行计算资源，这个构建方案能够有效减少证明时间。",
