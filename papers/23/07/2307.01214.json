    "translated_abstract": "尽管大规模预训练语言模型在文本分类方面取得了显著的成果，但最近的研究对于捷径学习的挑战提出了担忧。通常情况下，如果关键字与标签产生表面关联，从而导致错误预测，那么它被视为一种捷径。相反，如果模型依赖于能够产生准确预测的鲁棒因果特征，就可以缓解捷径学习。为此，许多研究探索了事后可解释的方法来挖掘鲁棒性和泛化性的捷径和因果特征。然而，大多数现有方法只关注句子中的单个单词，忽视了单词组的考虑，导致错误的因果特征。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的单词组挖掘方法，它能够捕捉任何关键字组合的因果效应，并对最影响预测的组合进行排序。我们的方法基于有效的事后分析和波束搜索，确保了算法的准确性。",
