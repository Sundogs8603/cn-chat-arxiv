    "translated_abstract": "时间脉冲识别在各个领域中起着重要作用，包括异常检测、关键词识别和神经科学。本文提出了一种新颖的算法，用于在稀疏事件序列数据上进行高效的时间脉冲模式识别。该算法结合奖励调节、Hebbian和反Hebbian学习方法，以识别短时间间隔训练中动态数据集中的模式。算法首先进行预处理，将输入数据理性化并转化为特征丰富且稀疏的脉冲时间序列数据。接下来，线性前馈脉冲神经网络处理这些数据，以识别已训练的模式。最后，下一层进行加权检查，以确保正确的模式已被检测出来。为了评估所提算法的性能，它在包含脉冲信息的语音数字的复杂数据集上进行了训练，并与最先进的方法进行了对比。",
