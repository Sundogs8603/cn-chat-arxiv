The proposed method is based on the efficient score functions of the cumulative distribution functions of potential outcomes, which are robust to certain misspecifications of the nuisance parameters, i.e., the outcome, treatment, and mediator models. We estimate these nuisance parameters by machine learning and use cross-fitting to reduce overfitting bias in the estimation of direct and indirect quantile treatment effects.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种双重/无偏的机器学习估计方法，用于处理可观测选择偏差的情况下的直接和间接分位治疗效应。这使得能够将二进制治疗的因果效应在特定结果排名上分解为通过中介变量（称为中介因子）间接影响和（未经中介的）直接影响的组成部分。所提方法基于潜在结果的累积分布函数的有效得分函数，对于某些固定参数的偏差，如结果、处理和中介模型，是稳健的。我们通过机器学习来估计这些固定参数，并使用交叉拟合来减小对直接和间接分位治疗效应估计的过拟合偏差。我们证明了我们效果估计量的一致性和渐近正态性。我们还提出了一个乘法自助法进行统计推断，并展示了乘法自助法的有效性。",
