We demonstrate our approach in the context of blackbox SVD-based matrix-completion methods commonly used in recommender system (RS) applications. We provide empirical results showing that enforcement of unit-consistency and shift-consistency, which have provable RS-relevant properties relating to robustness and fairness, also lead to improved performance according to generic RMSE and MAE performance metrics, irrespective of the initial chosen hyperparameter.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文讨论了在黑盒系统（例如基于人工智能的系统）中诱导所需的一致性和/或不变性属性的预处理和后处理方法。我们在常用于推荐系统应用中的黑盒基于SVD的矩阵补全方法的背景下演示了我们的方法。我们提供了实证结果，显示了单位一致性和平移一致性的强制执行，这些属性与推荐系统的鲁棒性和公平性有关，同时也通过通用的RMSE和MAE性能指标提高了性能，不受初始超参数的影响。",
