    "translated_abstract": "图形学习在许多场景中具有广泛的应用，这些场景需要更多的数据隐私保护。联邦学习是一种新兴的分布式机器学习方法，它利用个体设备或数据中心的数据来提高模型的准确性和泛化能力，同时保护用户数据的隐私。图形联邦学习主要基于经典的联邦学习框架，即客户端-服务器框架。然而，客户端-服务器框架面临诸如中央服务器的单点故障和网络拓扑的扩展性差等问题。首先，我们引入了分散框架到图形联邦学习中。其次，基于节点之间的数据相似性确定节点之间的置信度，然后通过线性加权基于置信度来聚合梯度信息。最后，我们将所提出的方法与FedAvg、Fedprox、GCFL和GCFL+进行比较，以验证其有效性。",
