In the past decade, the unprecedented increase in spatiotemporal Earth observation data has enabled data-driven forecasting models using deep learning techniques. These models have shown promise for diverse Earth system forecasting tasks but either struggle with handling uncertainty or neglect domain-specific prior knowledge, resulting in averaging possible futures to blurred forecasts or generating physically implausible predictions. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage pipeline for probabilistic spatiotemporal forecasting: 1) We develop PreDiff, a conditional latent diffusion model capable of probabilistic forecasts. 2) We incorporate an explicit knowledge control mechanism to align forecasts with domain-specific physical constraints.

    "translated_abstract": "传统上，地球系统预测主要依赖于复杂的物理模型，这些模型计算量大且需要领域专业知识。在过去的十年中，时空地球观测数据的空前增加使得使用深度学习技术的数据驱动预测模型成为可能。这些模型在不同的地球系统预测任务中显示出有希望的效果，但是它们要么难以处理不确定性，要么忽视特定领域的先验知识，导致预测结果模糊或产生物理上不合理的预测。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一种概率时空预测的两阶段流程：1）我们开发了一种名为PreDiff的条件隐式扩散模型，能够进行概率预测；2）我们融入了一种显式知识控制机制，以使预测符合特定领域的物理约束。这是通过在每个去噪步骤中估计与所施加约束的偏差来实现的。",
