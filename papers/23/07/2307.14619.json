    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个理论框架来研究在非线性动态系统中模仿随机、非马尔可夫、潜在多模态（即“复杂”）专家演示的行为。我们的框架使用低层控制器（无论是学习的还是隐含的）来稳定围绕专家演示的模仿策略。我们证明，在（a）合适的低层稳定性保证和（b）学习策略的随机连续性属性（我们称之为“总变差连续性”）（TVC）的情况下，一个精确估计演示者状态分布上的行动的模仿者会与演示者对整个轨迹的分布相近。然后，我们证明可以通过将流行的数据增强规则与一种新颖的算法技巧相结合（即在执行时添加增强噪声）来确保TVC并且最小程度上降低精度。我们将我们的保证实例化为由扩散模型参数化的策略，并证明如果学习者准确地估计了演示者的分布，则最终完成这种实例化。",
