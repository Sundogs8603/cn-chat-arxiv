    "translated_abstract": "组织经常难以确定产品质量和交货时间等指标变化的原因。当原因位于公司边界之外，处于部分可观察的多层级供应链中时，这项任务变得越来越具有挑战性。尽管传统的供应链管理主张通过数据共享获得更好的洞察力，但由于数据隐私问题，这在实践中并不常见。我们提出使用可解释的人工智能来实现对多阶段生产过程中感兴趣指标的估计贡献的去中心化计算。这种方法减轻了说服供应链参与者共享数据的需求，因为所有计算都是以去中心化的方式进行的。我们的方法是通过对真实多阶段制造过程进行数据收集进行经验证实的。结果显示，与使用集中化方法相比，我们的方法在检测质量变化的原因方面具有有效性。",
