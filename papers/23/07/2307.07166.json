    "translated_abstract": "本文描述了一种家庭服务机器人（DSR），根据自由形式的自然语言指令捡起日常物品并将其运送到指定的位置。给定如“将盘子左侧的瓶子移到空椅子上”之类的指令，DSR需要从环境中的多个候选项中识别出瓶子和椅子，并将目标物品搬运到目的地。现有的多模态语言理解方法大多在计算复杂性上都不实用，因为它们需要对目标物品候选项和目的地候选项的所有组合进行推理。我们提出了切换头尾漏斗UNITER，通过使用单个模型分别预测目标物品和目的地来解决这个任务。我们的方法在一个新构建的数据集上进行了验证，该数据集包含在标准的体验型人工智能模拟器中捕捉的物体操作指令和半真实感图像。",

The method predicts the target object and the destination individually using a single model, avoiding the computational complexity of inferring all combinations of candidates. Experimental results on a newly-built dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."
