    "abstract": "Today's online advertisers procure digital ad impressions through interacting with autobidding platforms: advertisers convey high level procurement goals via setting levers such as budget, target return-on-investment, max cost per click, etc.. Then ads platforms subsequently procure impressions on advertisers' behalf, and report final procurement conversions (e.g. click) to advertisers. In practice, advertisers may receive minimal information on platforms' procurement details, and procurement outcomes are subject to non-stationary factors like seasonal patterns, occasional system corruptions, and market trends which make it difficult for advertisers to optimize lever decisions effectively. Motivated by this, we present an online learning framework that helps advertisers dynamically optimize ad platform lever decisions while subject to general long-term constraints in a realistic bandit feedback environment with non-stationary procurement outcomes. In particular, we introduce a primal-d",

    "translated_abstract": "当今的在线广告商通过与自动投标平台进行交互来采购数字广告展示：广告商通过设置预算、目标投资回报率、每次点击的最大成本等参数来传达高级采购目标。然后广告平台代表广告商采购展示，并向广告商报告最终采购转化结果（例如点击量）。在实践中，广告商可能只会接收到平台采购细节的最少信息，并且采购结果受到季节性模式、偶发性系统故障和市场趋势等非稳态因素的影响，这使得广告商难以有效优化参数决策。鉴于此，我们提出了一个在线学习框架，帮助广告商在具有非稳态采购结果的现实多臂赌博环境下，在受通用长期约束条件限制的情况下动态优化广告平台的参数决策。具体而言，我们引入了一个原始的-d",
