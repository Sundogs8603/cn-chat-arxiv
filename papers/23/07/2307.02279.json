    "translated_abstract": "残差神经网络（ResNets）与连续时间控制系统（称为NeurODEs）之间的联系导致了神经网络的数学分析，为理论和实践中的重要结果提供了有趣的成果。然而，由于构造的关系，NeurODEs仅能描述宽度恒定的层，这使得它们无法用于模拟宽度可变的深度学习结构。在本文中，我们提出了一种连续时间自编码器，称为AutoencODE，它基于驱动动态的控制场的修改。这种改进使得原本设计用于常规NeurODEs的均值场控制框架得以扩展。在这个设置下，我们处理了Tikhonov正则化较低的情况，导致可能非凸的成本景观。虽然对于较高的Tikhonov正则化，全局得到的结果可能不适用于所有情况，但我们展示了很多结果在损失函数部分的区域可被恢复。",
