    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了统计推断中的过量最小风险，定义为从观测到的特征向量中估计随机变量的最小期望损失与从特征向量的转换（统计量）中估计相同随机变量的最小期望损失之间的差异。在描述了无损转换（即对于所有损失函数，过量风险为零的转换）之后，我们构建了一个对假设进行分区检验的统计量，用于判断给定转换是否为无损转换，并证明对于i.i.d.数据，该检验是强一致的。更一般地，我们根据信息理论给出了过量风险的上界，该上界在相当一般的损失函数类上都是一致的。基于这些界限，我们引入了“delta-无损转换”的概念，并给出了给定转换普遍是delta-无损的充分条件。该研究在分类、非参数回归、投资组合策略等方面具有应用价值。",

We propose a statistic to determine if a given transformation is lossless and introduce the concept of delta-lossless transformations.
