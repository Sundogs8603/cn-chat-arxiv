Specifically, we scrutinize the utility of LLMs in tasks such as: converting a text-based prompt into a design specification, transforming a design into manufacturing instructions, producing a design space and design variations, computing the performance of a design, and searching for designs predicated on performance. Through a series of examples, we highlight both the benefits and the limitations of the current LLMs. By exposing these limitations, we aspire to catalyze the continued improvement and progression of these models.",
