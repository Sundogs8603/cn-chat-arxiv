    "translated_abstract": "大多数现有的公平性研究假设模型可以完全访问人口信息。然而，由于数据采集期间未保留记录或出于隐私原因，存在人口信息部分可用的情况。这种情况被称为人口稀缺制度。先前的研究表明，训练一个属性分类器来替代缺失的敏感属性（代理）仍然可以改善公平性。然而，与真实敏感属性相比，使用代理敏感属性会加剧公平性和准确性之间的权衡。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一个框架来构建属性分类器，以实现更好的公平性和准确性的权衡。我们的方法在属性分类器中引入不确定性意识，并对具有推断出的最低不确定性的人口信息的样本强制执行公平性。我们通过实验证明，在具有不确定敏感属性的样本上强制执行公平约束会损害算法的总体准确性，但可以提高公平性。",

The research shows that introducing uncertainty awareness in attribute classifiers that replace missing sensitive attributes and enforcing fairness constraints on samples with the lowest uncertainty of inferred demographic information can achieve better fairness-accuracy trade-offs."
