    "translated_abstract": "许多先进的基于图像的精准农业技术，用于植物育种、田间作物研究和特定场地作物管理，都依赖于对具有高度可变形态生长阶段的植物的可靠检测和表型鉴定。卷积神经网络（CNNs）已经显示出在基于图像的植物表型鉴定和杂草识别方面具有潜力，但它们在识别生长阶段的能力，通常在外观上有明显差异的情况下，还不确定。Palmer amaranth（Amaranthus palmeri）是棉花（Gossypium hirsutum）生产中一种特别具有挑战性的杂草植物，它在整个生长季节的不同生长阶段和在同一生长阶段的不同植株中都表现出高度可变的植物形态，这是由于高遗传多样性引起的。本文以A. palmeri在棉花中的八个生长阶段识别作为一个具有挑战性的You Only Look Once (YOLO)架构模型进行研究。我们比较了来自YOLO v3、v5、v6、v6 3.0、v7和v8的26种不同架构变体。",
