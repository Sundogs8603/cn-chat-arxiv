    "abstract": "Recently, with the emergence of numerous Large Language Models (LLMs), the implementation of AI has entered a new era. Irrespective of these models' own capacity and structure, there is a growing demand for LLMs to possess enhanced comprehension of longer and more complex contexts with relatively smaller sizes. Models often encounter an upper limit when processing sequences of sentences that extend beyond their comprehension capacity and result in off-topic or even chaotic responses. While several recent works attempt to address this issue in various ways, they rarely focus on \"why models are unable to compensate or strengthen their capabilities on their own\". In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the nature of information transfer within LLMs and propose a novel technique called Attention Transition. This technique empowers models to achieve longer and better context comprehension with minimal additional training or impact on generation fluency. Our experiments are conducted in XSu",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，随着大量的大语言模型（LLMs）的出现，人工智能的实现进入了一个新的时代。无论这些模型自身的容量和结构如何，都存在对LLMs具有更长更复杂上下文的增强理解的需求，而模型通常在处理超出其理解能力范围的句子序列时会遇到上限，导致产生离题或混乱的回答。虽然最近有几项工作试图以不同的方式解决这个问题，但它们很少关注“为什么模型无法自行弥补或增强自己的能力”。在本文中，我们对LLMs内的信息传递性质进行了深入研究，并提出了一种名为注意力转移的新技术。这种技术能够使模型在最小化额外训练或对生成流利性的影响的情况下实现更长更好的上下文理解。我们的实验证明了这一点。",
