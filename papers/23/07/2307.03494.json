    "abstract": "The task of lane detection has garnered considerable attention in the field of autonomous driving due to its complexity. Lanes can present difficulties for detection, as they can be narrow, fragmented, and often obscured by heavy traffic. However, it has been observed that the lanes have a geometrical structure that resembles a straight line, leading to improved lane detection results when utilizing this characteristic. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical Deep Hough Transform (DHT) approach that combines all lane features in an image into the Hough parameter space. Additionally, we refine the point selection method and incorporate a Dynamic Convolution Module to effectively differentiate between lanes in the original image. Our network architecture comprises a backbone network, either a ResNet or Pyramid Vision Transformer, a Feature Pyramid Network as the neck to extract multi-scale features, and a hierarchical DHT-based feature aggregation head to accurately segment ",

    "translated_abstract": "由于车道的复杂性，车道检测任务在自动驾驶领域引起了广泛关注。车道的窄、断裂以及被交通拥堵所遮挡等特点使得车道检测困难重重。然而，观察发现车道具有几何结构，类似于一条直线，因此当利用这一特征时，车道检测结果得到了显著改善。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种分层的深度Hough变换（DHT）方法，将图像中所有的车道特征组合到Hough参数空间中。此外，我们还改进了点选取方法，并引入了动态卷积模块，以有效区分原始图像中的车道。我们的网络架构包括一个主干网络，即ResNet或金字塔视觉变换器（Pyramid Vision Transformer），一种特征金字塔网络作为中间层提取多尺度特征，并使用分层的基于DHT的特征聚合头准确地进行车道分割。",
