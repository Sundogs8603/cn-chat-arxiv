    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）在处理和学习图结构数据方面已经被证明是有效的。然而，先前的研究主要关注的是理解单一图输入，而许多现实应用需要对图结构数据进行成对分析（例如场景图匹配、代码搜索和药物相互作用预测）。为此，最近的研究开始将重点转向学习图对之间的交互。尽管这些方法的性能有所提升，但仍存在一些局限性，即交互是在节点级别进行考虑，导致计算成本高和性能亚优。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖而高效的图级方法，利用共同注意力在图汇聚中提取交互表示。我们的方法，称为共同注意力图汇聚（CAGPool），在使用实际数据集进行分类和回归任务时，相对于现有方法展现出竞争性能。",
