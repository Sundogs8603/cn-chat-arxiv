To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, fair federated averaging with augmented Lagrangian method (FFALM), designed explicitly to address group fairness issues in FL. Specifically, we impose a fairness constraint on the training objective and solve the minimax reformulation of the constrained optimization problem. Then, we derive the theoretical upper bound for the convergence rate of FFALM.

    "translated_abstract": "由于其保护隐私的特性，联邦学习 (FL) 吸引了相当多的关注。然而，管理用户数据的自由度不足可能导致群体公平性问题，即模型偏向于敏感因素诸如种族或性别。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种新颖的算法，名为带有增广拉格朗日方法的公平联邦平均法 (FFALM)，专门用于解决FL中的群体公平问题。具体来说，我们对训练目标施加了公平约束，并解决了受约束优化问题的极小化极大回归。然后，我们推导了FFALM的收敛速率的理论上界。通过在CelebA和UTKFace数据集中充分考虑严重统计异质性，实证结果表明了FFALM 在提高公平性方面的有效性。",
