    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a deadly disease that has become increasingly prevalent in recent years. Early detection is crucial for saving lives, but traditional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy and biopsy have limitations. Colonoscopy cannot provide detailed information within the tissues affected by cancer, while biopsy involves tissue removal, which can be painful and invasive. In order to improve diagnostic efficiency and reduce patient suffering, we studied machine-learningbased approach for colorectal tissue classification that uses acoustic resolution photoacoustic microscopy (ARPAM). With this tool, we were able to classify benign and malignant tissue using multiple machine learning methods. Our results were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "结直肠癌是一种致命的疾病，在近年来日益普遍。早期检测对于挽救生命至关重要，但传统的诊断方法如结肠镜检查和活检存在局限性。结肠镜无法提供癌症影响组织内详细信息，而活检涉及组织切除，可能引起疼痛和侵袭性。为了提高诊断效率和减少患者痛苦，我们研究了一种基于机器学习的声学分辨率光声显微镜 (ARPAM) 的结直肠组织分类方法。使用这种工具，我们能够使用多种机器学习方法对良性和恶性组织进行分类。我们的结果通过定量和定性分析，评估了我们方法的有效性。",
