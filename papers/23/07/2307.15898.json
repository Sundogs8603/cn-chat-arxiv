    "translated_abstract": "多模态大型模型因其在各种性能和下游任务中的优势而被认为是至关重要的。这些模型的发展对于未来实现通用人工智能至关重要。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的通用语言表示学习方法，称为UniBriVL，它基于Bridging-Vision-and-Language（BriVL）。通用BriVL将音频、图像和文本嵌入到一个共享空间中，实现了各种多模态应用的实现。我们的方法解决了稳健的语言（包括文本和音频）表示学习的主要挑战，并有效地捕捉到音频和图像之间的关联。此外，我们展示了从UniBriVL生成的图像的定性评估，这突出了我们的方法在从音频中创建图像方面的潜力。总体而言，我们的实验结果证明了UniBriVL在下游任务中的有效性以及其从音频中选择适当图像的能力。",
