    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在大型语言模型的上下文学习(ICL)性能中，各种演示组件的作用。具体而言，我们探讨了标签、输入分布和补充解释等因素的影响，特别是在这些因素被修改或扰动时的影响。我们基于之前的工作，这些工作对于这些元素如何影响ICL给出了不一致的结果。为了探究这些问题，我们采用了可解释的自然语言处理(XNLP)方法，并利用对比演示的显著性图进行定性和定量分析。我们的研究结果表明，改变标签对显著性有显著影响，尤其对于更大的语言模型更为明显。我们对输入分布进行了粒度级别的分析，发现在情感分析任务中，将表达情感的术语改为中性词并不像改变标签那样具有显著影响。最后，我们发现补充解释在提高ICL方面的效果是存在的。",
