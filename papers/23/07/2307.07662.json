    "translated_abstract": "边界框回归在目标检测和实例分割中被广泛使用，是目标定位的重要步骤。然而，大多数现有的边界框回归损失函数无法在预测的边界框与真实边界框具有相同宽高比但宽度和高度不同的情况下进行优化。为解决上述问题，我们充分探索了水平矩形的几何特征，并提出了一种基于最小点距离的边界框相似性比较指标MPDIoU，该指标包含了现有损失函数中考虑的所有相关因素，即重叠或非重叠区域、中心点距离和宽度高度的偏差，同时简化了计算过程。在此基础上，我们提出了一种基于MPDIoU的边界框回归损失函数，称为LMPDIoU。实验结果表明，将MPDIoU损失函数应用于现有的目标检测方法中可以获得更准确的结果。",
