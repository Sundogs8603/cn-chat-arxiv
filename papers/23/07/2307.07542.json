    "translated_abstract": "无源领域适应（SFDA）旨在在没有访问源领域数据的情况下从已标记的源领域自适应模型到未标记的目标领域，保持源领域的隐私。尽管在视觉应用中很常见，但是在时序应用中，SFDA还很少被研究。现有的主要设计用于视觉应用的SFDA方法可能无法处理时序数据中的时间动态，从而导致自适应性能受损。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种简单而有效的无源领域适应的时序数据方法，即MAsk and imPUte (MAPU)。首先，为了捕捉源领域的时间信息，我们的方法对时序信号进行随机掩蔽，同时利用一种新颖的时间插补器在嵌入空间中从掩蔽版本中恢复原始信号。其次，在适应步骤中，插补器网络被利用来引导目标模型产生目标结果。",
