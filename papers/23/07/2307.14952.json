    "translated_abstract": "随着网络规模的增大，现有的完全分布式解决方案开始落后于现实世界的挑战，如（1）信息传播缓慢，（2）网络通信故障和（3）外部敌对攻击。本文关注分层系统架构，并解决了容易受到通信故障和敌对攻击的网络上的非贝叶斯学习问题。在网络通信方面，考虑包丢失的链路故障。我们首先提出了一种分层鲁棒的push-sum算法，可以在频繁的包丢失链路故障情况下实现平均一致性。我们为参数服务器和任意选择的网络代表之间提供了一种稀疏信息融合规则。然后，将一致性更新步骤与以KL散度作为邻近函数的双均值更新步骤交替进行，得到了一种具有可证明收敛性的容错非贝叶斯学习算法。",
