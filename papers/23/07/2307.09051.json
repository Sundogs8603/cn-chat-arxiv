    "translated_abstract": "为了在无线资源限制下提高多智能体强化学习的性能，我们提出了一种消息重要性度量，并设计了一种重要性感知调度策略来有效交换消息。关键洞察是将宝贵的通信资源用于重要的消息上。消息的重要性不仅取决于消息本身，还取决于接收消息的智能体的需求。因此，我们提出了一种基于查询消息的架构，称为QMNet。智能体通过环境观测生成查询和消息。共享查询可以帮助计算消息的重要性。交换消息可以帮助智能体更好地协作。除此之外，我们利用消息重要性来处理去中心化系统中的随机接入冲突。此外，我们提出了一种消息预测机制来补偿未传输的消息。最后，我们在一个交通路口环境中评估了所提出的方案。",
