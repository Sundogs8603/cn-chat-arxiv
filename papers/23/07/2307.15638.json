    "abstract": "The volume of a brain lesion (e.g. infarct or tumor) is a powerful indicator of patient prognosis and can be used to guide the therapeutic strategy. Lesional volume estimation is usually performed by segmentation with deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), currently the state-of-the-art approach. However, to date, few work has been done to equip volume segmentation tools with adequate quantitative predictive intervals, which can hinder their usefulness and acceptation in clinical practice. In this work, we propose TriadNet, a segmentation approach relying on a multi-head CNN architecture, which provides both the lesion volumes and the associated predictive intervals simultaneously, in less than a second. We demonstrate its superiority over other solutions on BraTS 2021, a large-scale MRI glioblastoma image database.",

    "translated_abstract": "脑病变（如梗死或肿瘤）的体积是患者预后的有力指标，并可用于指导治疗策略。目前，通常通过深度卷积神经网络（CNN）进行分割来估计病变体积，这是最先进的方法。然而，迄今为止，很少有研究将体积分割工具配备适当的定量预测区间，这可能会影响其在临床实践中的有用性和接受度。在这项工作中，我们提出了TriadNet，一种基于多头CNN架构的分割方法，可以在不到一秒钟内同时提供病变体积和相关的预测区间。我们在BraTS 2021上证明了其优于其他解决方案的性能，这是一个大规模的MRI脑胶质母细胞瘤图像数据库。",
