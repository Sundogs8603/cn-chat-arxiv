    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在可能存在非稳态环境下的线性赌博机中的固定预算最佳臂识别问题。给定有限臂集合X，固定预算T以及不可预测的参数序列θ，算法的目标是以尽可能高的概率正确识别最佳臂x*。之前的工作已经在稳态设置下进行了研究，并且证明了错误概率随着预算的增加而指数下降。但在许多现实世界的A/B/n多变量测试场景中，环境是非稳态的，而一个期望稳态的算法很容易失败。为了具有鲁棒的识别能力，众所周知，如果在每个时间步从X的一个G-最优设计中以随机和非自适应的方式选择臂，那么可以实现最佳臂的鲁棒识别。",

The algorithm achieves robust identification of the best arm by randomly selecting arms from a G-optimal design at each time step."
