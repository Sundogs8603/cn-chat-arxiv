    "abstract": "With social media usage growing exponentially in the past few years, fake news has also become extremely prevalent. The detrimental impact of fake news emphasizes the need for research focused on automating the detection of false information and verifying its accuracy. In this work, we present the outcome of the Factify 2 shared task, which provides a multi-modal fact verification and satire news dataset, as part of the DeFactify 2 workshop at AAAI'23. The data calls for a comparison based approach to the task by pairing social media claims with supporting documents, with both text and image, divided into 5 classes based on multi-modal relations. In the second iteration of this task we had over 60 participants and 9 final test-set submissions. The best performances came from the use of DeBERTa for text and Swinv2 and CLIP for image. The highest F1 score averaged for all five classes was 81.82%.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着社交媒体的使用在过去几年呈指数级增长，假新闻也变得非常普遍。假新闻的有害影响强调了研究自动检测错误信息并验证其准确性的需求。在这项工作中，我们呈现了Factify 2的结果，这是作为AAAI'23的DeFactify 2工作坊的一部分提供的多模态事实验证和讽刺新闻数据集。数据呼唤一种基于比较的方法来配对社交媒体声明和支持文件，包括文本和图像，根据多模态关系分为5类。在这个任务的第二次迭代中，我们有超过60个参与者和9个终期测试提交。最好的表现来自于在文本方面使用DeBERTa，在图像方面使用Swinv2和CLIP。所有五个类别的F1分数平均达到了81.82%。",
