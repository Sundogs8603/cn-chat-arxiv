    "translated_abstract": "当前道路图方法的主要问题之一是误报率高。道路图过滤是在后处理步骤中从道路图数据中移除误报道路的选项。在本文中，我们训练了一个深度神经网络用于过滤道路图数据，其中道路图的每条道路线被分类为\"合理的\"、\"不合理的\"或\"不确定的\"。为此，我们使用了四种不同的道路图过滤策略作为监督器：TractQuerier、RecobundlesX、TractSeg和一种基于解剖学的过滤器。它们的输出被组合起来以获得道路线的分类标签。我们评估了沿道路线执行此分类任务所需的不同类型的信息的重要性，包括道路线的坐标、扩散数据、关键点、T1加权信息和脑区分割。我们发现在这种特定情况下，道路线的坐标是最相关的，其次是扩散数据。",
