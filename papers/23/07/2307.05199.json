    "translated_abstract": "超出分布检测的最优预测策略是机器学习中的一个基本问题。本文提出了三种超出分布检测的拒绝选项模型：基于成本的模型、有界TPR-FPR模型和有界精确度-召回率模型。这些模型扩展了非超出分布检测中使用的标准拒绝选项模型，并定义了最优超出分布选择分类器的概念。我们证明了尽管这些模型在公式上不同，但它们都共享一类最优策略。受到最优策略的启发，我们引入了双评分超出分布方法，利用来自两个选择的超出分布检测器的不确定度评分：一个专注于超出分布/内部分布的区分，另一个专注于误分类检测。实验结果一致表明，与最先进的方法相比，这种简单策略的性能更优。此外，我们还提出了新颖的评估方法。",
