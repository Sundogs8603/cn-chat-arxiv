    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人工智能在许多不同领域得到了广泛应用，并对人类生活产生了深远而直接的影响。随之而来的是，对于模型进行预测的原理的需求。由于当前大多数高精度模型都是黑盒子，既有AI科学家也没有最终用户深入理解这些模型的内部情况。因此，为了解释AI模型的目的，研究了许多算法，尤其是在计算机视觉领域的图像分类问题中，如LIME、CAM、GradCAM。然而，这些算法仍然存在一些限制，比如LIME的执行时间长和CAM对具体性和清晰性的解释不清。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一种新方法，称为分割-类别激活映射（SeCAM），它结合了上述算法的优点，同时克服了它们的缺点。我们用各种数据集来测试了这个算法，并与其他算法进行了对比。",
