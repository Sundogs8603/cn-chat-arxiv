    "abstract": "Purpose: This study evaluated the out-of-domain performance and generalization capabilities of automated medical image segmentation models, with a particular focus on adaptation to new image acquisitions and disease type.  Materials: Datasets from both non-contrast and contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans of healthy patients and those with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) were used. A total of 400 images (100 non-contrast controls, 100 contrast controls, 100 non-contrast PKD, 100 contrast PKD) were utilized for training/validation of models to segment kidneys, livers, and spleens, and the final models were then tested on 100 non-contrast CT images of patients affected by PKD. Performance was evaluated using Dice, Jaccard, TPR, and Precision.  Results: Models trained on a diverse range of data showed no worse performance than models trained exclusively on in-domain data when tested on in-domain data. For instance, the Dice similarity of the model trained on 25% from each dataset was foun",
