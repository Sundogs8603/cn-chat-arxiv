    "translated_abstract": "本研究对网络旅行者的全局和局部路径偏好进行属性级别分析。为此，提出了一种奖励分解方法，并将其整合到基于链接的递归（马尔可夫）路径选择模型中。该方法将与每个状态-动作对相关联的瞬时奖励函数分解为全局效用和局部效用，其中全局效用是从网络中任何地方全局感知到的属性的函数，局部效用是仅从当前状态局部感知到的属性的函数。只有全局效用进入每个状态的值函数，表示达到目的地的未来预期效用。这种具有分解奖励函数的全局-局部路径选择模型使我们能够分析哪些属性在多大程度上影响了代理商的全局和局部路径选择。此外，与大多数自适应路径选择模型不同，所提出的模型可以基于揭示的路径观察结果进行估计（而无需其他信息）。",
