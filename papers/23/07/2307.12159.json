    "abstract": "Identifying Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in its early stages is essential for establishing the beginning of treatment, enriching the outlook, and enhancing the overall well-being of those affected individuals. However, early diagnosis and detecting the disease's signs is not straightforward. A simpler and cheaper way arises by analyzing the patient's facial expressions through computational methods. When a patient with ALS engages in specific actions, e.g., opening their mouth, the movement of specific facial muscles differs from that observed in a healthy individual. This paper proposes Facial Point Graphs to learn information from the geometry of facial images to identify ALS automatically. The experimental outcomes in the Toronto Neuroface dataset show the proposed approach outperformed state-of-the-art results, fostering promising developments in the area.",

    "translated_abstract": "在肌萎缩侧索硬化（ALS）的早期阶段识别肌萎缩侧索硬化（ALS）对于确定治疗的开始、丰富前景和提高受影响个体的整体幸福感至关重要。然而，早期诊断和检测疾病的迹象并不直接。通过计算方法分析患者的面部表情可以提供一种更简单和更便宜的方式。当ALS患者进行特定的动作，例如张嘴，特定面部肌肉的运动与健康个体中观察到的不同。本文提出了面部关键点图以从面部图像的几何学中学习信息以自动识别ALS。多伦多神经脸数据集中的实验结果表明，所提出的方法优于最先进的结果，促进了该领域的有希望的发展。",
