    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种数据驱动的模拟器，随机天气生成器（SWG），适用于估计法国和斯堪的纳维亚长时间热浪的概率。这个模拟器基于环流的类比方法，我们加入温度和土壤湿度作为预测字段。我们将模拟器训练在一个中等复杂度气候模型的运行上，并展示它能够预测样本外热浪的条件概率（预测）。我们特别注意，使用适用于罕见事件的合适评分来评估这个预测。为了加速类比的计算，降维技术被应用，并且性能得到评估。通过SWG实现的概率预测与使用卷积神经网络（CNN）实现的概率预测进行了比较。随着数百年的训练数据的可用性，CNN在概率预测任务上表现更好。此外，我们还展示了经过8个训练实例训练的SWG模拟器的效果。",
