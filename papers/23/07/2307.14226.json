Due to the limitations of the Integrated assessment models (IAMs) model, it is difficult to simulate the dynamic negotiation process. Therefore, using deep learning to build a new agents based model (ABM) might can provide new theoretical support for climate negotiations. Building on the RICE-N model, this work proposed an approach to climate negotiations based on existing trade groups. Simulation results show that the scheme has a good prospect.",

    "translated_abstract": "气候问题变得越来越重要。尽管全球政府取得了一些进展，但我们仍面临着国际合作前景不明的事实。由于综合评估模型（IAMs）的局限性，很难模拟动态谈判过程。因此，利用深度学习构建一个新的基于智能体的模型（ABM）可能为气候谈判提供新的理论支持。本研究在RICE-N模型基础上，提出了一个基于现有贸易集团的气候谈判方法。模拟结果显示该方案具有良好前景。",
