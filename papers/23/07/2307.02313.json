    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了BLUE团队在eRisk Lab任务中搜索抑郁症状的贡献。该任务包括从BDI-II问卷中检索和排名Reddit社交媒体句子，这些句子传达了抑郁症状。鉴于LLMs提供的合成数据已被证明是增加数据和微调下游模型的可靠方法，我们选择使用ChatGPT为每个BDI-II问卷的症状生成合成数据。我们设计了一个提示，使生成的数据比每个问题的BDI-II响应更丰富和语义多样化，同时包含了Reddit上分享经历更私密方式中特有的情感和轶事经历。我们通过余弦相似度执行语义搜索并对句子与BDI-II症状的相关性进行排名。我们使用了两种最先进的基于Transformer的模型（MentalRoBERTa和MPNet的变体）进行嵌入。",
