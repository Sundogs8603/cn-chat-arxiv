    "translated_abstract": "数据增强（DA）是一种增加训练数据数量和多样性的技术，从而减少过拟合并改善泛化能力。然而，标准的数据增强只能产生具有有限多样性的合成数据。生成对抗网络（GANs）可以通过生成具有真实图像外观的合成样本来解锁数据集中的额外信息。然而，这些模型难以同时满足三个关键要求：保真度和高质量样本、多样性和模式覆盖、以及快速采样。实际上，GAN可以快速生成高质量的样本，但模式覆盖差，限制了它们在数据增强应用中的应用。我们提出了一种名为LatentAugment的数据增强策略，它克服了GAN的低多样性问题，从而使其在数据增强应用中得到应用。在没有外部监督的情况下，LatentAugment修改潜在向量并将其移动到潜在空间中的特定区域，以最大程度地增加合成图像的多样性和保真度。",
