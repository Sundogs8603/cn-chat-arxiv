    "translated_abstract": "自动化谈判支持系统的目标是帮助人类谈判者在多问题谈判中实现更有利的结果（例如，雇主和候选人在工作提议之前就薪水、工时和晋升等问题进行谈判）。为了成功，这些系统必须实时准确地跟踪参与者达成的协议。现有方法要么集中于任务导向的对话，要么产生非结构化的输出，使它们不适用于此目标。我们的工作引入了两方多问题谈判的协议跟踪的新任务，这要求在一个结构化的状态空间内连续监测协议。为了解决缺乏具有真实多问题谈判对话的标注语料库的问题，我们使用GPT-3构建了GPT-Negochat，一份我们公开的合成数据集。我们通过在MultiWOZ 2.4语料库上进行迁移学习，给出了我们任务的强有力的初始基线，对T5模型进行了预训练，包括T5-small和T5-...",
