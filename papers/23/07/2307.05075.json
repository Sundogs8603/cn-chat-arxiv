    "translated_abstract": "从实际图像中去除多种退化，如雾、雨和模糊，是一个具有挑战性和不适定问题。最近提出了能够处理不同退化的统一模型，并取得了有希望的结果。然而，这些方法主要集中在合成图像上，并且在应用于实际图像时性能显著下降。在本文中，我们引入了Uni-Removal，这是一个两阶段半监督框架，用于使用统一模型和参数解决实际图像中多种退化问题。在知识传递阶段，Uni-Removal利用监督多教师和学生架构，在知识传递阶段中促进从预训练的专门处理不同退化 类型的教师网络中学习。引入了多粒度对比损失来增强来自特征和图像空间的学习。在域适应阶段，通过引入对抗训练进行无监督微调。",
