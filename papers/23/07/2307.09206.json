    "translated_abstract": "在自主导航环境中，多个参数可能会发生变化。地形特性如摩擦系数可能会根据机器人的位置而随时间变化。此外，机器人的动力学可能会因不同负载、系统质量变化、磨损等原因而发生变化，从而改变执行器增益或关节摩擦力。自主代理应该能够适应这些变化。在本文中，我们开发了一种新颖的概率地形和机器人感知前向动力学模型，称为TRADYN，它能够适应上述变化。它基于基于神经过程的元学习前向动力学模型的最新进展。我们在模拟的二维导航环境中评估了我们的方法，使用了一个类似自行车的机器人和具有空间变化摩擦系数的不同地形布局。在我们的实验中，与非自适应方法相比，所提出的模型在长视程轨迹预测任务中表现出较低的预测误差。",
