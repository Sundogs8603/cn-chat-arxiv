    "translated_abstract": "在这篇文章中，我们提出了关于图神经网络（GNNs）表达能力的新结果。我们证明了对于任何具有分段多项式激活函数、其体系结构大小不随图输入大小增长的GNNs，存在一对深度为二的非同构根树，使得GNNs在任意迭代次数内无法区分它们的根节点。证明依赖于对称多项式代数的工具。相比之下，已经知道具有分段多项式激活函数的无界GNNs（其大小允许随图大小改变）只需两次迭代即可区分这些顶点。我们的结果对于有界大小和无界大小的GNNs之间存在严格的分离，回答了 [Grohe, 2021] 提出的一个开放性问题。接下来，我们证明如果允许非分段多项式激活函数，则在两次迭代中，单个神经元感知器可以区分任意一对非同构树的根节点。",

    "en_tdlr": "This article presents new results on the expressivity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with piecewise polynomial activations and the distinction ability between bounded and unbounded size GNNs. It is proven that there exists a pair of non-isomorphic rooted trees that cannot be distinguished by GNNs with fixed architecture size, while GNNs with variable size can distinguish them in only two iterations. Additionally, it is shown that a single neuron perceptron with activations other than piecewise polynomial can distinguish the root vertices of any pair of non-isomorphic trees in two iterations."
