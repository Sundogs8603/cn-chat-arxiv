The procedure can be applied to any exploration setting in a task-independent and intrinsically driven manner. We first demonstrate our approach in a maze navigation task and show that our model is capable of discovering the underlying transition distribution and reconstructing the spatial features of the environment. Second, we apply our model to the more complex task of active vision, where an agent must actively sample its visual environment to gather information. We show that our model is able to build unsupervised representations that allow it to actively sample and efficiently categorize sensory scenes. We further show that using these representations as input for downstream classification leads to superior data efficiency and learning speed compared to other baselines, while also maintaining lower parameter complexity.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于预测编码和不确定性最小化的全流程的主动探索方法。该方法可以在任何任务无关和内在驱动的情境下应用于探索。我们首先在迷宫导航任务中展示了我们的方法，并展示了我们的模型能够发现基础的转换分布并重建环境的空间特征。其次，我们将我们的模型应用于更复杂的主动视觉任务中，其中一个代理必须主动采样其视觉环境以获取信息。我们展示了我们的模型能够构建无监督表示，使其能够主动采样和高效分类感知场景。我们进一步展示，使用这些表示作为下游分类的输入相比其他基线方法具有更高的数据效率和学习速度，同时保持更低的参数复杂度。",
