    "abstract": "To mitigate potential risks associated with language models, recent AI detection research proposes incorporating watermarks into machine-generated text through random vocabulary restrictions and utilizing this information for detection. While these watermarks only induce a slight deterioration in perplexity, our empirical investigation reveals a significant detriment to the performance of conditional text generation. To address this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective semantic-aware watermarking algorithm that considers the characteristics of conditional text generation and the input context. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method yields substantial improvements across various text generation models, including BART and Flan-T5, in tasks such as summarization and data-to-text generation while maintaining detection ability.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了减轻语言模型可能带来的潜在风险，最近的AI检测研究提出了通过随机限制词汇并利用此信息进行检测的方式将水印嵌入到机器生成的文本中。虽然这些水印只会导致困惑度轻微下降，但我们的实证调查揭示了对条件文本生成性能的显著影响。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一个简单但有效的语义感知水印算法，考虑了条件文本生成的特性和输入上下文。实验结果表明，我们提出的方法在各种文本生成模型（包括BART和Flan-T5）中取得了显著改进，在摘要生成和数据到文本生成等任务中仍保持了检测能力。",
