    "abstract": "This study offers a new paradigm of individual-level modeling to address the grand challenge of incorporating human behavior in epidemic models. Using generative artificial intelligence in an agent-based epidemic model, each agent is empowered to make its own reasonings and decisions via connecting to a large language model such as ChatGPT. Through various simulation experiments, we present compelling evidence that generative agents mimic real-world behaviors such as quarantining when sick and self-isolation when cases rise. Collectively, the agents demonstrate patterns akin to multiple waves observed in recent pandemics followed by an endemic period. Moreover, the agents successfully flatten the epidemic curve. This study creates potential to improve dynamic system modeling by offering a way to represent human brain, reasoning, and decision making.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提供了一种新的个体层面建模范式，以解决将人类行为纳入流行病模型的重大挑战。通过在基于智能体的流行病模型中利用生成型人工智能，每个智能体都能够通过连接到大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）进行自主推理和决策。通过各种模拟实验，我们呈现了令人信服的证据，表明生成型智能体模仿了现实世界的行为，如生病时进行隔离，病例增加时进行自我隔离。总体而言，智能体展示了类似于近期流行病观察到的多次波动，然后是一段流行期。此外，智能体成功地使流行病曲线平坦化。该研究提供了一种改进动态系统建模的潜力，通过提供一种表示人类大脑、推理和决策的方法。",
