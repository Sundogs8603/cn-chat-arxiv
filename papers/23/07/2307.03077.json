    "translated_abstract": "带符号图是表示信任关系或各个领域中的偏好关系的复杂系统。在这样的图中学习节点表示对于许多挖掘任务至关重要。虽然现实世界中的符号关系可能受多个潜在因素的影响，但大多数现有方法往往过于简化符号关系的建模，依赖社交理论并将其视为简单的因素。这限制了它们的表达能力和捕捉塑造这些关系的多样因素的能力。在本文中，我们提出了DINES，一种在无社交假设的有向带符号图中学习解缠节点表示的新方法。我们采用了一种解缠框架，将每个嵌入分离成不同的因素，从而可以捕捉多个潜在因素。我们还探索了轻量级的图卷积，仅关注符号和方向，而不依赖社交理论。此外，我们提出了一个有效的解码器，能够有效地对符号关系进行分类。",
