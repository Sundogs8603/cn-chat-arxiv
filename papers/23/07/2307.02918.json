    "abstract": "This paper examines whether personality influences the allocation of resources within households. To do so, I model households as couples who make Pareto-efficient allocations and divide resources according to a distribution function. Using a sample of Dutch couples from the LISS survey with detailed information on consumption, labor supply, and personality traits at the individual level, I find that personality affects intrahousehold allocations through two channels. Firstly, the level of these traits acts as preference factors that shape individual tastes for consumed goods and leisure time. Secondly, by testing distribution factor proportionality and the exclusion restriction of a conditional demand system, I observe that differences in personality between spouses act as distribution factors. Specifically, these differences in personality impact the allocation of resources by affecting the bargaining process within households. For example, women who are relatively more conscientious",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了人格是否影响家庭资源分配。为了探究这个问题，作者将家庭建模为进行 Pareto 有效分配并根据分配函数来分配资源的夫妻。通过使用来自荷兰莱斯调查（LISS survey）的夫妻样本，该样本提供了关于消费、劳动供给和个体层面的人格特征的详细信息。研究发现，人格通过两个渠道影响家庭内部的资源分配。首先，这些特征的水平作为偏好因素，塑造个体对消费品和休闲时间的口味。其次，通过测试分布因素的比例性和条件需求系统的排除限制，作者观察到配偶之间的人格差异作为分布因素。具体而言，这些人格差异通过影响家庭内的议价过程来影响资源分配。例如，相对更有责任心的妇女可能会受到影响。",
