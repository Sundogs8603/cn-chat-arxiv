In this paper, we construct a novel theory for understanding the effectiveness of neural networks by discovering the mystery underlying a common practice during neural network model construction: sample splitting. Our theory demonstrates that, the optimal hyperparameters derived from sample splitting can enable a neural network model that asymptotically minimizes the prediction risk. We conduct extensive experiments across different application scenarios and network architectures, and the results manifest our theory's effectiveness.",
