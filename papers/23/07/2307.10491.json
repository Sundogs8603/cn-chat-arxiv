    "translated_abstract": "传统的马尔可夫决策过程模型通常考虑基于常数折扣因子的几何折扣。然而，一些最近的研究表明，在某些应用中，对时间变化的折扣因子进行建模是必要的。本文研究了具有时变折扣因子的无穷时间程决策过程模型。我们采用博弈论的视角，将每个时间步骤视为一个独立的决策者，拥有自己的（固定的）折扣因子，并研究所得到的博弈的子博弈完美均衡以及相关的算法问题。我们给出了一个存在子博弈完美均衡的构造性证明，并展示了计算子博弈完美均衡的时间复杂度的EXPTIME困难性。我们还转向近似的$\\epsilon$-子博弈完美均衡的概念，证明了在较温和的假设下，存在一个$\\epsilon$-子博弈完美均衡。我们介绍了一个计算$\\epsilon$-子博弈完美均衡的算法，并给出了时间复杂度的上界。",
