To address this gap, we evaluate six established baseline causal discovery methods and a newly proposed method based on GFlowNets, on the downstream task of treatment effect estimation. Through the implementation of a robust evaluation procedure, we offer valuable insights into the efficacy of these causal discovery methods for treatment effect estimation, considering both synthetic and real-world scenarios, as well as low-data scenarios.

    "translated_abstract": "决策中因果性的实际应用被广泛认可，因果发现和推理在本质上是相互交织的。然而，在因果发现方法的评估中存在明显的差距，对下游推理的重视程度不足。为了填补这一空白，我们评估了六种已建立的基准因果发现方法和一种基于 GFlowNets 的新方法在治疗效果估计的下游任务上的表现。通过实施一个稳健的评估过程，我们为治疗效果估计的这些因果发现方法的有效性提供了有价值的见解，考虑了合成和真实场景以及低数据场景。此外，我们研究的结果表明，GFlowNets 具有有效捕捉各种有用和多样的平均处理效应模式的能力。",
