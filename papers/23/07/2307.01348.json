    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑对大量资产的高频数据进行现货/瞬时波动率矩阵的估计。我们首先将经典的非参数核平滑与广义收缩技术相结合，对噪音无数据进行矩阵估计，在均匀稀疏性假设下，这是文献中常用的近似稀疏性的自然扩展。该方法的均匀一致性性质得到了证明，并具有与最优极小极大收敛速率相当的收敛速率。对于受微观结构噪声污染的高频数据，我们引入了一种局部预平均估计方法，可以降低噪声的有效幅度。然后我们使用在无噪声情形下开发的估计工具，并为所开发的现货波动率矩阵估计器推导了均匀收敛速率。我们进一步将核平滑与收缩技术相结合，估计时变波动率。",

The method achieves estimation under a uniform sparsity assumption for noise-free data and introduces a localized pre-averaging estimation method for data contaminated by microstructure noise. The paper also derives convergence rates for both noise-free and noisy scenarios and extends the estimation method to time-varying volatility."
