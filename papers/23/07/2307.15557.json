    "translated_abstract": "本文针对动态图中的k中心问题提出了第一种高效算法。在这个问题中，目标是通过选择k个中心将输入分为k个集合，使得任意数据点到最近中心的最大距离最小化。已知在该问题中，要获得优于2的近似解是NP难的。尽管在许多应用中，输入可以自然地建模为图，但在动态环境下的k中心问题的先前研究都是基于度量空间的。本文给出了一种确定性递减的（2+ε）近似算法和一种随机增量的（4+ε）近似算法，对于加权图，两种算法的摊销更新时间为kn^{o(1)}。此外，我们还展示了一种约简方法，从而得到了对于k中心问题的全动态（2+ε）近似算法，其最坏情况更新时间与维护（1+k近似解的最新上界相差不超过k。",
