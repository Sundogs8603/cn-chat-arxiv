    "translated_abstract": "近年来，加密货币在投资者和机构中的作用在金融系统中迅速扩大，因此，有必要调查这些现象并开发能够捕捉它们之间相互关系、与其他全球系统的联系以及序列异质性的统计方法。因此，本文介绍了基于隐马尔可夫回归模型的，使用制度转换的copula方法联合估计加密货币收益的分位数和期望分位数。所提出的方法允许我们关注极端收益，并通过引入随时间演变的系数来描述它们的时间演化，这些系数根据潜在马尔可夫链进行演化。此外，为了建模加密货币的时间变化依赖结构，我们考虑了由状态特定参数定义的椭圆形copula函数。通过期望最大化算法获得最大似然估计。经验分析研究了日频数据之间的关系。",
