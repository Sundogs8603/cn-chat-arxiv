    "translated_abstract": "在过去几十年中，使用光学字符识别（OCR）技术对大量纸质历史文档（如书籍和报纸）进行了数字化存档。不幸的是，这种广泛使用的技术在处理写于数百年前的OCR文档时容易出错。神经网络在解决各种文本处理任务，包括OCR后校正方面取得了巨大成功。然而，对于希伯来语这样的形态丰富语言，使用神经网络处理历史语料库的主要缺点是它们需要大量充足的训练数据集来学习。此外，由于希伯来语的独特特点，神经网络在OCR错误校正方面的最佳结构和超参数值（预定义参数）尚不清楚。此外，语言在不同的流派和时期也会发生变化。这些变化可能会影响OCR后校正神经网络模型的准确性。",

However, due to the morphologically-rich nature of Hebrew, the lack of sufficient training datasets and unclear optimal network structure and hyperparameter values pose challenges. Additionally, language changes across genres and periods may affect the accuracy of OCR post-correction models."
