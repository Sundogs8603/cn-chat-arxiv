    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色。虽然已经提出了各种结构不同的小样本语义分割模型，但是性能的改进已经达到了瓶颈。本文提出了一种首次利用扩散模型用于小样本语义分割任务的方法，称为DifFSS。DifFSS是一种新颖的小样本语义分割范式，可以在不修改网络结构的情况下显著提高最先进的小样本语义分割模型的性能。具体来说，我们利用扩散模型的强大生成能力，通过使用语义掩码、涂抹或软HED边界的支持图像作为控制条件，生成多样化的辅助支持图像。这个生成过程模拟了查询图像类别内的多样性，如颜色、纹理变化和光照等。因此，小样本语义分割模型可以参考更多多样的支持图像，产生更具鲁棒性的表示，从而实现一致的性能改进。",
