    "translated_abstract": "水溶解度是一种有价值但难以预测的性质。使用一级原理方法计算溶解度需要考虑熵和焓的竞争效应，导致计算时间较长且准确性相对较差。基于数据驱动的方法，如深度学习，提供了更高的准确性和计算效率，但通常缺乏不确定性量化。此外，任何计算技术的易用性仍然是一个问题，导致群体贡献方法的持续流行。在这项工作中，我们使用一种具有预测不确定性的深度学习模型来解决这些问题，该模型在静态网站上运行（无需服务器）。这种方法将计算需求转移到网站访问者身上，而不需要安装，消除了支付和维护服务器的需求。我们的模型在溶解度预测上取得了令人满意的结果。此外，我们展示了如何创建平衡溶解度预测模型。",
