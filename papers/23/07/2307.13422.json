    "abstract": "Volatility-based trading strategies have attracted a lot of attention in financial markets due to their ability to capture opportunities for profit from market dynamics. In this article, we propose a new volatility-based trading strategy that combines statistical analysis with machine learning techniques to forecast stock markets trend.  The method consists of several steps including, data exploration, correlation and autocorrelation analysis, technical indicator use, application of hypothesis tests and statistical models, and use of variable selection algorithms. In particular, we use the k-means++ clustering algorithm to group the mean volatility of the nine largest stocks in the NYSE and NasdaqGS markets. The resulting clusters are the basis for identifying relationships between stocks based on their volatility behaviour. Next, we use the Granger Causality Test on the clustered dataset with mid-volatility to determine the predictive power of a stock over another stock. By identifyin",

    "translated_abstract": "基于波动性的交易策略因其能够从市场动态中捕捉利润机会而在金融市场中引起了很大关注。在本文中，我们提出了一种将统计分析与机器学习技术相结合的新型基于波动性的交易策略，用于预测股市趋势。该方法包括数据探索、相关性和自相关性分析、技术指标使用、假设检验和统计模型应用以及变量选择算法的使用等多个步骤。特别地，我们使用k-means++聚类算法对纽约证券交易所和纳斯达克交易所的九个最大股票的平均波动性进行分组。得到的聚类结果是基于股票波动性行为来识别股票之间关系的基础。接下来，我们使用格兰杰因果性检验对中等波动性的聚类数据集进行，以确定一只股票对另一只股票的预测能力。通过识别这些关系，我们构建一个交易系统来预测股市趋势。",
