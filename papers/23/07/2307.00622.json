    "abstract": "We study the problem of sharing the revenue obtained by selling museum passes from the axiomatic perspective. In this setting, we propose replacing the usual dummy axiom with a milder requirement: order preservation with dummies. This new axiom formalizes the philosophical idea that even null agents/museums may have the right to receive a minimum allocation in a sharing situation. By replacing dummy with order preservation with dummies, we characterize several families of rules, which are convex combinations of the uniform and Shapley approaches. Our findings generalize several existing results in the literature. Also, we consider a domain of problems that is richer than the domain proposed by Ginsburgh and Zang (2003) in their seminal paper on the museum pass problem.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们从公理的角度研究了销售博物馆通行证所获得的收入的问题。在这个设置中，我们建议用一个更温和的要求来代替通常的虚拟人公理：带着虚拟人的顺序维持。这个新的公理形式化了哲学思想，即即使是空代理/博物馆，在分享的情况下也有权利获得最小的分配。通过用带有虚拟人的顺序维持代替虚拟人，我们表征了几个规则家族，它们是均匀和Shapley方法的凸组合。我们的研究结果概括了文献中已有的几个结果。此外，我们考虑的问题领域比Ginsburgh和Zang在他们关于博物馆通行证问题的开创性论文中提出的领域更为丰富。",
