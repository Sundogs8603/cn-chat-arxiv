    "translated_abstract": "随着扩散模型的最新进展，生成式语音增强（SE）因其对未知测试噪声的巨大潜力而受到了大量研究的关注。然而，现有的研究主要集中在清晰语音的固有特性上进行推理，没有充分利用真实世界条件下变化的噪声信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种噪声感知语音增强（NASE）方法，该方法提取噪声特定信息来引导扩散模型的逆向处理过程。具体而言，我们设计了一个噪声分类（NC）模型，用于产生声学嵌入作为噪声调节器来指导逆向降噪过程。同时，我们设计了多任务学习方案，共同优化SE和NC任务，以增强提取的噪声调节器的噪声特异性。我们提出的NASE被证明是一个即插即用的模块，可以推广到任何扩散SE模型。VoiceBank-DEMAND数据集上的实验证据表明，NASE达到了",
