    "abstract": "We study the influence of additional intermediate marginal distributions on the value of the martingale optimal transport problem. From a financial point of view, this corresponds to taking into account call option prices not only, as usual, for those call options where the respective future maturities coincide with the maturities of some exotic derivative but also additional maturities and then to study the effect on model-independent price bounds for the exotic derivative. We characterize market settings, i.e., combinations of the payoff of exotic derivatives, call option prices and marginal distributions that guarantee improved price bounds as well as those market settings that exclude any improvement.  Eventually, we showcase in numerous examples that the consideration of additional price information on vanilla options may have a considerable impact on the resultant model-independent price bounds.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了额外中间边际分布对马丁格尔最优输运问题价值的影响。从金融角度来看，这意味着不仅考虑那些期权到期时间与某些异态衍生品到期时间相一致的期权价格，还考虑额外的到期时间，并研究对异态衍生品的无模型定价下界的影响。我们表征了市场设置，即异态衍生品的回报、期权价格和边际分布的组合，可以保证改进的价格下界，以及那些排除任何改进的市场设置。最后，我们通过多个示例展示，考虑到香草期权上的额外价格信息可能对产生的无模型定价下界产生相当大的影响。",
