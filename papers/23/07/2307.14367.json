    "translated_abstract": "大型生物系统的复杂性使某些科学家将其理解归类为难以想象的任务。不同级别的挑战使这项任务复杂化，其中之一是预测蛋白质的功能。近年来，通过开发各种机器学习方法，在这个领域取得了重大进展。然而，大多数现有的方法将任务表述为多分类问题，即将预定义标签分配给蛋白质。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的方法——Prot2Text，以自由文本样式预测蛋白质的功能，超越传统的二进制或分类分类。通过在编码器-解码器框架中结合图神经网络（GNNs）和大型语言模型（LLMs），我们的模型有效地整合了蛋白质序列、结构和文本注释等多种数据类型。这种多模态方法允许对蛋白质功能进行整体表示。",
