    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the character networks extracted from three popular television series and explore the relationship between a TV show episode's character network metrics and its review from IMDB. Character networks are graphs created from the plot of a TV show that represents the interactions of characters in scenes, indicating the presence of a connection between them. We calculate various network metrics for each episode, such as node degree and graph density, and use these metrics to explore the potential relationship between network metrics and TV series reviews from IMDB. Our results show that certain network metrics of character interactions in episodes have a strong correlation with the review score of TV series. Our research aims to provide more quantitative information that can help TV producers understand how to adjust the character dynamics of future episodes to appeal to their audience.
