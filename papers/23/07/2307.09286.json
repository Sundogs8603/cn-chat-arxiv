    "abstract": "The objective of this work is to give patch-size flexibility to Audio Spectrogram Transformers (AST). Recent advancements in ASTs have shown superior performance in various audio-based tasks. However, the performance of standard ASTs degrades drastically when evaluated using different patch sizes from that used during training. As a result, AST models are typically re-trained to accommodate changes in patch sizes. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a training procedure to provide flexibility to standard AST models without architectural changes, allowing them to work with various patch sizes at the inference stage - FlexiAST. This proposed training approach simply utilizes random patch size selection and resizing of patch and positional embedding weights. Our experiments show that FlexiAST gives similar performance to standard AST models while maintaining its evaluation ability at various patch sizes on different datasets for audio classification tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究的目标是为音频光谱图变换器（AST）提供补丁大小的灵活性。最近的AST技术的进展在各种基于音频的任务中显示出优越的性能。然而，标准AST的性能在使用不同的补丁大小进行评估时会急剧下降，而非训练时使用的补丁大小。因此，AST模型通常需要重新训练以适应补丁大小的变化。为了克服这个限制，本文提出了一种训练方法，以在不改变架构的情况下为标准AST模型提供灵活性，使其在推理阶段可以与各种不同的补丁大小一起工作- FlexiAST。这种提出的训练方法只是利用随机补丁大小选择和补丁大小调整和位置嵌入权重调整。我们的实验证明，FlexiAST在保持其在不同数据集上的各种补丁大小的评估能力的同时，提供了与标准AST模型相似的性能，用于音频分类任务。",
