    "abstract": "Encoding-decoding CNNs play a central role in data-driven noise reduction and can be found within numerous deep-learning algorithms. However, the development of these CNN architectures is often done in ad-hoc fashion and theoretical underpinnings for important design choices is generally lacking. Up to this moment there are different existing relevant works that strive to explain the internal operation of these CNNs. Still, these ideas are either scattered and/or may require significant expertise to be accessible for a bigger audience. In order to open up this exciting field, this article builds intuition on the theory of deep convolutional framelets and explains diverse ED CNN architectures in a unified theoretical framework.

    "translated_abstract": "编码-解码卷积神经网络在数据驱动的噪声抑制中起着核心作用，并在许多深度学习算法中使用。然而，这些CNN架构的开发通常是以临时的方式进行的，对于重要的设计选择缺乏理论基础。到目前为止，有不同的相关工作致力于解释这些CNN的内部操作。然而，这些想法要么零散分布，要么可能需要相当的专业知识才能为更广泛的受众所理解。为了打开这个令人兴奋的领域，本文通过将信号处理的基本原理与深度学习领域相连接，以统一的理论框架解释了不同的ED CNN架构，并在这一自包含的材料中提供了设计强大高效新型CNN架构的重要指南。",
