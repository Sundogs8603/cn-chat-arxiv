    "abstract": "The rise of large language models (LLMs) has marked a pivotal shift in the field of natural language processing (NLP). LLMs have revolutionized a multitude of domains, and they have made a significant impact in the medical field. Large language models are now more abundant than ever, and many of these models exhibit bilingual capabilities, proficient in both English and Chinese. However, a comprehensive evaluation of these models remains to be conducted. This lack of assessment is especially apparent within the context of radiology NLP. This study seeks to bridge this gap by critically evaluating thirty two LLMs in interpreting radiology reports, a crucial component of radiology NLP. Specifically, the ability to derive impressions from radiologic findings is assessed. The outcomes of this evaluation provide key insights into the performance, strengths, and weaknesses of these LLMs, informing their practical applications within the medical domain.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的崛起标志着自然语言处理（NLP）领域的重大转变。LLMs已经在许多领域引起了革命性的变化，并在医学领域产生了重要影响。大型语言模型比以往任何时候都更丰富，并且其中许多模型具有双语能力，可以熟练处理英文和中文。然而，对这些模型进行全面评估仍有待开展。在放射学NLP的背景下，尤其明显缺乏这种评估。本研究旨在通过对32个LLMs在解释放射学报告方面进行批判性评估来填补这一空白。具体评估了从影像学发现中得出印象的能力。这个评估的结果为这些LLMs的性能、优势和弱点提供了关键见解，并为它们在医学领域的实际应用提供了指导。",
