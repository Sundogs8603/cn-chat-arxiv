    "abstract": "When measuring rare processes at Belle II, a huge luminosity is required, which means a large number of simulations are necessary to determine signal efficiencies and background contributions. However, this process demands high computation costs while most of the simulated data, in particular in case of background, are discarded by the event selection. Thus, filters using graph neural networks are introduced at an early stage to save the resources for the detector simulation and reconstruction of events discarded at analysis level. In our work, we improved the performance of the filters using graph attention and investigated statistical methods including sampling and reweighting to deal with the biases introduced by the filtering.",

    "translated_abstract": "在Belle II测量稀有过程时，需要巨大的亮度，这意味着需要大量的模拟来确定信号效率和背景贡献。然而，这个过程需要高计算成本，而大部分模拟数据，特别是在背景情况下，都被事件选择丢弃了。因此，在早期阶段引入使用图神经网络的过滤器，以节省资源用于探测器模拟和事件重建，并且还改进了过滤器的性能，并研究统计方法，包括采样和重新加权，来处理过滤引入的偏差。",
