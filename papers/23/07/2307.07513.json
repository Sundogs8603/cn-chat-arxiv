    "abstract": "Background: The predictive Intensive Care Unit (ICU) scoring system plays an important role in ICU management because it predicts important outcomes, especially mortality. Many scoring systems have been developed and used in the ICU. These scoring systems are primarily based on the structured clinical data in the electronic health record (EHR), which may suffer the loss of important clinical information in the narratives and images. Methods: In this work, we build a deep learning based survival prediction model with multi-modality data to predict ICU mortality. Four sets of features are investigated: (1) physiological measurements of Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, (2) common thorax diseases pre-defined by radiologists, (3) BERT-based text representations, and (4) chest X-ray image features. We use the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) dataset to evaluate the proposed model. Results: Our model achieves the average C-index of 0.7829 (95% confidence i",
