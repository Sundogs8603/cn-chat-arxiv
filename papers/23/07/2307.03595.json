    "translated_abstract": "编码器-解码器深度神经网络在多视角时间序列预测中得到了越来越多的研究，尤其是在实际应用中。然而，为了准确预测，这些复杂模型通常依赖于大量的具有丰富历史数据的时间序列示例。一个越来越受关注的研究主题是预测缺乏足够历史数据的时间序列，通常被称为“冷启动”问题。在本文中，我们引入了一种新颖而简单的方法来解决这个问题，通过利用图神经网络 (GNNs) 作为数据增强来增强这些预测器使用的编码器。这些基于GNN的特征能够捕捉复杂的跨序列关系，并且它们的生成过程可以与预测任务进行端到端的优化。我们展示了我们的架构可以使用数据驱动或基于领域知识定义的图，能够扩展到包含数百万节点的多个非常大的图的信息。",
