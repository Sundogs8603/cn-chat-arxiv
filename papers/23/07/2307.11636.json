    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了OxfordTVG-HIC（Humorous Image Captions）这个大规模的用于幽默生成和理解的数据集。幽默是一个抽象、主观和与上下文相关的认知构建，涉及多个认知因素，使得生成和解释幽默成为一项具有挑战性的任务。因此，幽默生成和理解可以作为评估深度学习方法处理抽象和主观信息能力的新任务。由于数据的稀缺性，与幽默相关的生成任务（如字幕生成）仍未得到充分探索。为填补这一空白，OxfordTVG-HIC提供了约290万个图像-文本对，并附带幽默评分，用于训练一个具有通用幽默字幕生成能力的模型。与现有的字幕数据集不同，OxfordTVG-HIC具有广泛的情感和语义多样性，导致一些脱离上下文的例子，特别适合生成幽默。此外，OxfordTVG-HIC经过精心策划，不含冒犯性内容。我们还展示了如何使用Oxf",
