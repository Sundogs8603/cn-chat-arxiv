    "abstract": "In the field of music information retrieval (MIR), cover song identification (CSI) is a challenging task that aims to identify cover versions of a query song from a massive collection. Existing works still suffer from high intra-song variances and inter-song correlations, due to the entangled nature of version-specific and version-invariant factors in their modeling. In this work, we set the goal of disentangling version-specific and version-invariant factors, which could make it easier for the model to learn invariant music representations for unseen query songs. We analyze the CSI task in a disentanglement view with the causal graph technique, and identify the intra-version and inter-version effects biasing the invariant learning. To block these effects, we propose the disentangled music representation learning framework (DisCover) for CSI. DisCover consists of two critical components: (1) Knowledge-guided Disentanglement Module (KDM) and (2) Gradient-based Adversarial Disentanglemen",

    "translated_abstract": "在音乐信息检索（MIR）领域中，Cover歌曲识别（CSI）是一项具有挑战性的任务，旨在从大量的歌曲库中识别出查询歌曲的Cover版本。现有的方法由于建模中特定版本因素和无版本因素的缠绕性，仍然存在高内部和外部歌曲之间的变异性和相关性。在本研究中，我们的目标是解缠出特定版本因素和无版本因素，这能够使模型更容易学习到适用于未见查询歌曲的不变音乐表示。我们使用因果图技术以解缠的视角分析了CSI任务，并确定了影响不变学习的内部版本和外部版本效应。为了阻止这些效应，我们提出了用于CSI的解缠绕音乐表示学习框架（DisCover）。DisCover包括两个关键组件：（1）知识引导的解缠模块（KDM）和（2）基于梯度的对抗解缠。",
