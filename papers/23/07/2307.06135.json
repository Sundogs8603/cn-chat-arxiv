However, grounding these plans in expansive, multi-floor, and multi-room environments presents a significant challenge for robotics. We introduce SayPlan, a scalable approach to LLM-based, large-scale task planning for robotics using 3D scene graph (3DSG) representations. To ensure the scalability of our approach, we: (1) exploit the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs to allow LLMs to conduct a semantic search for task-relevant subgraphs from a smaller, collapsed representation of the full graph; (2) reduce the planning horizon for the LLM by integrating a classical path planner and (3) introduce an iterative replanning pipeline that refines the initial plan using feedback from a scene graph simulator, correcting infeasible actions and avoiding planning failures. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale environments spanning up to 3 floors, 36 rooms and 140 objects",

    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLM）在开发多样化任务的通用规划智能体方面取得了令人印象深刻的结果。然而，将这些规划应用于庞大、多层楼、多房间的环境中对机器人提出了重大挑战。我们介绍了一种名为SayPlan的可扩展方法，利用3D场景图（3DSG）表示进行基于LLM的大规模任务规划。为了确保我们的方法的可扩展性，我们：（1）利用3DSG的层次结构允许LLMs从较小的、折叠的完整图表示中进行语义搜索，寻找与任务相关的子图；（2）通过集成经典路径规划器减少LLM的规划视野；（3）引入一个迭代的重规划流程，通过与场景图模拟器的反馈来修正不可行的动作并避免规划失败。我们在两个涵盖3层、36个房间和140个对象的大规模环境上评估了我们的方法。",
