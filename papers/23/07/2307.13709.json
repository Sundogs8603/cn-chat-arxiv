    "abstract": "Many properties in real world, such as desirability or strength in competitive environment, can't be directly observed, which makes them difficult to evaluate. To deal with this challenging problem, prior work has primarily focused on estimating those properties of known items, especially the strength of sports players, only of those who appears in paired comparison dataset. In this paper, we introduce Deep Bradley-Terry Rating (DBTR), a novel ML framework to evaluate any properties of unknown items, not necessarily present in dataset. Our method seamlessly integrates traditional Bradley-Terry model with a neural network structure. We also generalizes this architecture further for asymmetric environment with unfairness, which is much more common in real world settings. In our experimental analysis, DBTR successfully learned desired quantification of those properties.",

    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界中，许多属性，如竞争环境中的可取性或强度，无法直接观测，这使得它们难以评估。为了解决这个具有挑战性的问题，先前的研究主要集中在估计已知物品的这些属性，特别是出现在配对比较数据集中的运动员的实力。在本文中，我们介绍了深度布拉德利-特里评分（DBTR），这是一个新颖的机器学习框架，用于评估不一定存在于数据集中的未知物品的任何属性。我们的方法无缝地将传统的布拉德利-特里模型与神经网络结构相结合。我们还进一步推广了这个架构，用于具有不公平性的非对称环境，这在现实世界中更为常见。在我们的实验分析中，DBTR成功地学习了这些属性的预期量化。",
