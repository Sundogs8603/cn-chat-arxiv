    "abstract": "This study applies Activity Theory and investigates the attitudes and contradictions of 67 English as a foreign language (EFL) students from four Hong Kong secondary schools towards machine-in-the-loop writing, where artificial intelligence (AI) suggests ideas during composition. Students answered an open-ended question about their feelings on writing with AI. Results revealed mostly positive attitudes, with some negative or mixed feelings. From a thematic analysis, contradictions or points of tension between students and AI stemmed from AI inadequacies, students' balancing enthusiasm with preference, and their striving for language autonomy. The research highlights the benefits and challenges of implementing machine-in-the-loop writing in EFL classrooms, suggesting educators align activity goals with students' values, language abilities, and AI capabilities to enhance students' activity systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究应用活动理论探讨了来自香港四所中学的67名英语作为外语（EFL）学生对机器辅助写作的态度和矛盾。在写作过程中，人工智能（AI）提供创作想法。学生回答了一个开放性问题，表达他们对与AI一起写作的感受。研究结果显示，大部分学生持积极态度，但也存在一些负面或矛盾的感情。通过主题分析发现，学生和AI之间的矛盾或紧张点源于AI的不足，学生在热情和偏好之间的平衡，以及他们追求语言自主性。研究突出了在EFL课堂上实施机器辅助写作的益处和挑战，建议教育工作者将活动目标与学生的价值观、语言能力和AI能力相一致，以提高学生的活动系统。",
