    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在线分类中的付费随机专家。在这种情况下，每个专家在进行预测之前必须付费。我们支付给每个专家的金额通过某个未知的Lipschitz“生产力”函数直接影响他们的预测准确性。在每一轮中，学习者必须决定为每个专家支付多少金额，然后进行预测。他们所承担的成本是预测误差和所有专家的预付款的加权总和。我们引入了一种在线学习算法，其在T轮后的总成本最多超过事先知道所有专家生产力的预测算法的成本$\\mathcal{O}(K^2(\\log T)\\sqrt{T})$，其中K是专家的数量。为了实现这个结果，我们结合了Lipschitz Bandits和基于替代损失的在线分类。这些工具使我们能够改进标准Lipschitz Bandit设置中的$T^{2/3}$阶段的界限。我们还对合成数据集进行了算法的实证评估。",
