    "translated_abstract": "传统上，将预训练的语言模型适应到新领域，如临床应用，需要重新训练所有参数。然而，由于训练这些大型语言模型所需的计算资源巨大，这种方法的实践性越来越被证明是不切实际的。为了解决这个问题，参数高效微调（PEFT）技术提供了一种可行的解决方案，通过选择性地微调一个小的附加参数集，显著减少了领域适应所需的计算资源。在本研究中，我们提出了临床LLaMA-LoRA，这是一个构建在开源LLaMA模型上的PEFT适配器层。临床LLaMA-LoRA使用从MIMIC-IV数据库中获取的临床记录进行训练，从而创建了一个专为临床领域设计的专用适配器。此外，我们提出了一个两步PEFT框架，将临床LLaMA-LoRA与Downstream LLaMA-LoRA进行融合，后者是另一个专为下游任务设计的PEFT适配器。",
