    "translated_abstract": "近期相关工作表明，自然语言处理系统在解决竞赛辩论中的问题方面具有应用性。竞赛辩论中最重要的任务之一是辩手创建高质量的辩论案例。我们展示了使用限制最短路径遍历在争论的语义知识图上构建有效的辩论案例的方法。我们在一个名为DebateSum的大规模数据集上研究了这种潜力，该数据集针对的是一种名为政策辩论的美国竞赛辩论类型。我们通过向数据集中引入53180个新的例子，并为每个例子提供进一步有用的元数据，显著改进了DebateSum。我们利用txtai语义搜索和知识图工具链基于这个数据集产生并贡献了9个语义知识图。我们创建了一种独特的评估方法，以确定在政策辩论案例生成的背景下哪个知识图更好。",
