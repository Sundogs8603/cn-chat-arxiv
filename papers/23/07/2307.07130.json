    "abstract": "The digital health industry has grown in popularity since the 2010s, but there has been limited analysis of the topics discussed in the field across academic disciplines. This study aims to analyze the research trends of digital health-related articles published on the Web of Science until 2021, in order to understand the concentration, scope, and characteristics of the research. 15,950 digital health-related papers from the top 10 academic fields were analyzed using the Web of Science. The papers were grouped into three domains: public health, medicine, and electrical engineering and computer science (EECS). Two time periods (2012-2016 and 2017-2021) were compared using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling. The number of topics was determined based on coherence score, and topic compositions were compared using a homogeneity test. The number of optimal topics varied across domains and time periods. For public health, the first and second halves had 13 and 19 topics, res",
