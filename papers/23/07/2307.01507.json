To alleviate this issue, We propose a novel DDI prediction method based on relation-aware subgraph embedding with co-contrastive learning, RaSECo.

The two graphs are used respectively for learning and propagating the RaSEs of drugs, thereby ensuring that all drugs, including new ones, can aggregate effective RaSEs.

    "translated_abstract": "关注关系的子图嵌入对于预测多关系药物相互作用（DDI）非常有前景。然而，现有方法中大部分都局限于学习现有药物的子图嵌入，导致在涉及新药物的测试DDIs中出现严重过拟合问题。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了一种基于关注关系的子图嵌入与对比学习的新型DDI预测方法，即RaSECo。RaSECo构建了两个异构药物图：多关系DDI图和基于多属性的药物相似度（DDS）图。这两个图分别用于学习和传播药物的子图嵌入，从而确保所有药物，包括新药物，能够聚合有效的子图嵌入。此外，我们采用了交叉视图对比机制来增强药物对（DP）的嵌入。",
