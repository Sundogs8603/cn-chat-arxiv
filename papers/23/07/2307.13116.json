Pathway is equipped with a Table API tailored for Python and Python/SQL workflows, and is powered by a distributed incremental dataflow in Rust.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了Pathway，一个新的统一数据处理框架，可以在有界和无界数据流上运行工作负载。该框架的创建最初是为了解决在分析和处理物理经济数据时面临的挑战，包括由物联网和企业系统生成的数据流。这些都需要快速反应，并需要应用先进的计算范 paradigms（机器学习驱动的分析，上下文分析和复杂事件处理的其他元素）。Pathway配备了针对Python和Python/SQL工作流程量身定制的Table API，并由Rust中的分布式增量数据流驱动。我们描述了该系统，并呈现了基准测试结果，表明它在批处理和流处理场景中的能力，可以超过最先进的行业框架。我们还讨论了由Pathway处理的流处理用例，这些用例无法轻松解决以状态为基础的方案。",
