    "translated_abstract": "在一种时间依赖的Ornstein-Uhlenbeck模型中，介绍了美式期权的半解析定价方法。论文指出，为了获得这些定价，需要数值地求解一个非线性的第二类Volterra积分方程来找到行权边界（它是时间的函数）。一旦完成这一步骤，期权价格就可以得到。论文还证明了，计算上，这种方法与前向有限差分求解器一样高效，同时提供更好的精度和稳定性。后来，作者（还与Peter Carr和Alex Lipton合作）将这种方法显著扩展到各种时间依赖的一因子和随机波动率模型，用于定价障碍期权。然而，对于美式期权，尽管可能存在，但这并没有在任何地方明确报告过。本文的目标是填补这个空白，并讨论哪种数值方法（包括...）",
