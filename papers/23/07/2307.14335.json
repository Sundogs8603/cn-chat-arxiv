    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型在整合不同的专家模型以解决复杂的语言和视觉任务方面显示出巨大的潜力。尽管它们在推动人工智能生成内容领域的发展方面具有重要意义，但它们在智能音频内容创作方面的潜力仍未被发掘。在这项工作中，我们解决了使用文本指令创建涵盖语音、音乐和音效的音频内容的问题。我们提出了一种名为WavJourney的系统，利用大型语言模型连接各种音频模型进行音频内容生成。给定一个听觉场景的文本描述，WavJourney首先提示大型语言模型生成一个专用于音频叙事的结构脚本。音频脚本包含了不同的音频元素，根据它们的时空关系进行组织。作为音频的概念表示，音频脚本为人类参与提供了互动和可解释的理由。随后，音频脚本被传递给音频生成模型，生成相应的音频内容。",
