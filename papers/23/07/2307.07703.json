    "translated_abstract": "时间序列分类为随机（噪声样）或非随机（结构化）有助于理解多个领域中的基本动态。本研究提出了一个基于两足矩阵分解的算法，利用了两种互补的技术进行分类。在奇异值分解（SVD）分析部分，我们对包含时间信息的奇异向量进行拓扑分析（Betti数），得到SVD标签。同时，进行时间顺序无关的主成分分析（PCA），并计算所提出的PCA衍生特征。观察到这些特征从两个标签的合成时间序列中提取出来，将时间序列映射到线性可分的特征空间中。使用支持向量机（SVM）生成PCA标签。所提出的方法已应用于合成数据，包括41个白噪声、粉红噪声（随机性）的实验，生长率为4的Logistic映射和Lorentz系统（非随机性）。",
