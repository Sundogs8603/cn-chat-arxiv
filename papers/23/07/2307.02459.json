    "translated_abstract": "数据库对齐是图对齐问题的一种变体：给定一对包含独立但相关特征的匿名数据库，问题是仅根据相关性识别特征之间的对应关系，并对齐匿名用户集。这与植入匹配密切相关，其中给定一个带有随机权重的二分图，目标是识别生成给定权重的潜在匹配。我们研究了一个具有多变量高斯特征的数据库对齐问题实例，并推导出适用于数据库对齐和植入匹配的结果，展示了它们之间的联系。当数据库特征的维度是\\(\\omega(\\log n)\\)（其中\\(n\\)是对齐的大小）时，数据库对齐的性能阈值会收敛到植入匹配的性能阈值，并且没有个别特征过强。对于植入匹配和数据库对齐来说，最大似然算法都适用。",
