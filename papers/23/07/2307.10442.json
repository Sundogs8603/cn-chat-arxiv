    "abstract": "Although large-scale pre-trained language models (PTLMs) are shown to encode rich knowledge in their model parameters, the inherent knowledge in PTLMs can be opaque or static, making external knowledge necessary. However, the existing information retrieval techniques could be costly and may even introduce noisy and sometimes misleading knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose the instance-level adaptive propulsion of external knowledge (IAPEK), where we only conduct the retrieval when necessary. To achieve this goal, we propose measuring whether a PTLM contains enough knowledge to solve an instance with a novel metric, Thrust, which leverages the representation distribution of a small number of seen instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that thrust is a good measurement of PTLM models' instance-level knowledgeability. Moreover, we can achieve significantly higher cost-efficiency with the Thrust score as the retrieval indicator than the naive usage of external knowledge",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管大规模预训练语言模型（PTLM）已被证明在其模型参数中编码了丰富的知识，但PTLM中的内在知识可能是不透明或静态的，因此需要外部知识。然而，现有的信息检索技术可能成本高昂，甚至可能引入噪音和误导性知识。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了实例级的自适应推动外部知识（IAPEK），只有在必要时才进行检索。为了实现这一目标，我们提出了一种新的度量标准Thrust，利用少量已见实例的表示分布来衡量PTLM是否包含足够的知识来解决一个实例。大量实验证明，Thrust是衡量PTLM模型实例级知识能力的良好指标。此外，利用Thrust分数作为检索指标可以实现显著的成本效益，高于对外部知识的朴素使用。",
