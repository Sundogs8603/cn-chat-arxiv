    "abstract": "We investigate, at the fundamental level, the questions of `why', `when' and `how' one could or should reach out to poor and vulnerable people to support them in the absence of governmental institutions. We provide a simple and new approach that is rooted in linear algebra and basic graph theory to capture the dynamics of income circulation among economic agents. A new linear algebraic model for income circulation is introduced, based on which we are able to categorize societies as fragmented or cohesive. We show that, in the case of fragmented societies, convincing wealthy agents at the top of the social hierarchy to support the poor and vulnerable will be very difficult. We also highlight how linear-algebraic and simple graph-theoretic methods help explain, from a fundamental point of view, some of the mechanics of class struggle in fragmented societies. Then, we explain intuitively and prove mathematically why, in cohesive societies, wealthy agents at the top of the social hierarchy",

    "translated_abstract": "我们从根本层面探讨了在缺乏政府机构支持的情况下，为什么、何时和如何去帮助贫穷和易受困者的问题。我们提出了一个基于线性代数和基础图论的简单而新颖的方法来捕捉经济主体之间的收入循环动力学。引入了一个针对收入循环的新的线性代数模型，根据该模型我们可以将社会划分为分散的或凝聚的。我们表明，在分散的社会中，说服社会层级顶部的富裕代理人支持贫穷和易受困者将极为困难。我们还强调了线性代数和简单图论方法如何从基本观点解释分散社会中阶级斗争的一些机制。然后，我们直观地说明并从数学上证明了为什么在凝聚社会中，社会层级顶部的富裕代理人有动机和能力支持贫穷和易受困者。",

It presents a new model based on linear algebra and graph theory to explain the dynamics of income circulation and categorizes societies as fragmented or cohesive. In fragmented societies, convincing wealthy agents to support the poor is difficult, but in cohesive societies, wealthy agents have the motivation and capability to support the vulnerable."
