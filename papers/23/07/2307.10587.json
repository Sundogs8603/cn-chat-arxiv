    "translated_abstract": "自动语音识别（ASR）系统旨在将口语转录为书面文本，并在语音助手和转录服务等各种应用中发挥作用。然而，观察到尽管最先进的ASR系统在提供令人印象深刻的基准结果方面取得了成功，但由于说话者的语音特性存在差异，它们在某些地区或人口统计信息的说话者身上面临困难。在这项工作中，我们描述了一个庞大的语音数据集的策划，该数据集包含8740小时的技术讲座，以及由代表印度各个地区人口统计信息的讲师进行的讲座的记录。该数据集来源于非常流行的NPTEL MOOC平台。我们使用策划的数据集，通过衡量印度说话者的多样性人口统计特征，来衡量YouTube自动字幕和OpenAI Whisper模型的性能差异。",
