    "abstract": "Nitrogen fertilization of boreal forests is investigated in terms of microeconomics, as a tool for carbon sequestration. The effects of nitrogen fertilization's timing on the return rate on capital and the expected value of the timber stock are investigated within a set of semi-fertile, spruce-dominated boreal stands, using an inventory-based growth model. Early fertilization tends to shorten rotations, reducing timber stock and carbon storage. The same applies to fertilization after the second thinning. Fertilization applied ten years before stand maturity is profitable and increases the timber stock, but the latter effect is small. Fertilization of mature stands, extending any rotation by ten years, effectively increases the carbon stock. Profitability varies but is increased by fertilization, instead of merely extending the rotation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文以微观经济学的角度研究了在波兰森林中使用氮肥作为碳固定工具。通过基于库存的生长模型，在一组半肥沃、以云杉为主的波兰林地中，研究了氮肥施用时间对资本回报率和预期的木材库存价值的影响。早期施肥倾向于缩短轮换期，减少木材库存和碳储存。对第二次间伐后施肥也同样适用。在林地成熟前十年施肥是有利可图的，能增加木材库存，但后者效果较小。对成熟林地施肥，将轮换期延长十年，能有效增加碳库存。盈利能力有所差异，但施肥可以增加盈利能力，而不仅仅是延长轮换期。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the microeconomics of nitrogen fertilization in boreal carbon forestry in Poland. The study finds that early fertilization and fertilization after the second thinning shorten rotations and decrease timber and carbon storage, while fertilization applied ten years before stand maturity increases timber stock and fertilization of mature stands effectively increases carbon stock. Fertilization increases profitability and not just extending the rotation period."
