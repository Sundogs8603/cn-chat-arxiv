    "abstract": "At various stages during the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, various US states and local municipalities enacted eviction moratoria. One of the main aims of these moratoria was to slow the spread of COVID-19 infections. We deploy a semiparametric difference-in-differences approach with an event study specification to test whether the lifting of these local moratoria led to an increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths. Our main findings, across a range of specifications, are inconclusive regarding the impact of the moratoria especially after accounting for the number of actual evictions and conducting the analysis at the county level. We argue that recently developed augmented synthetic control (ASCM) methods are more appropriate in this setting. Our ASCM results also suggest that the lifting of eviction moratoria had little to no impact on COVID-19 cases and deaths. Thus, it seems that eviction moratoria had little to no robust effect on reducing the spread of COVID-19 throwing in",

    "translated_abstract": "在COVID-19大流行的初期阶段，各个美国州和地方政府实施了驱逐暂停措施。这些暂停措施的主要目的之一是减缓COVID-19感染的传播。我们采用半参数差异控制与事件研究规范来测试这些地方暂停措施解除是否导致COVID-19病例和死亡人数的增加。我们的主要发现，在考虑实际驱逐情况并在县级进行分析后，各种规范下的结果并不一致。我们认为，在这种情况下，最近发展的增强合成控制（ASCM）方法更为适用。我们的ASCM结果还表明，解除驱逐暂停措施对COVID-19病例和死亡人数几乎没有影响。因此，似乎驱逐暂停措施对减少COVID-19传播的影响很小。",
