    "abstract": "In many applications, when building linear regression models, it is important to account for the presence of outliers, i.e., corrupted input data points. Such problems can be formulated as mixed-integer optimization problems involving cubic terms, each given by the product of a binary variable and a quadratic term of the continuous variables. Existing approaches in the literature, typically relying on the linearization of the cubic terms using big-M constraints, suffer from weak relaxation and poor performance in practice. In this work we derive stronger second-order conic relaxations that do not involve big-M constraints. Our computational experiments indicate that the proposed formulations are several orders-of-magnitude faster than existing big-M formulations in the literature for this problem.",

    "translated_abstract": "在许多应用中，当构建线性回归模型时，考虑到异常值的存在——即受损的输入数据点，是很重要的。这类问题可以通过混合整数优化问题来表达，其中每个问题由二进制变量和连续变量的二次项的乘积给出，形成三次项。现有的文献方法通常依靠使用big-M约束线性化三次项，但在实践中表现出弱放松和性能差的缺点。本工作中，我们推导了不涉及big-M约束的二次锥松弛形式。我们的计算实验表明，对于这个问题，提议的公式比现有文献中的big-M公式快数个数量级。",
