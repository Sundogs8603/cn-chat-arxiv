    "translated_abstract": "本文提供了一个针对单领域广义目标检测（即Single-DGOD）的新框架，其中我们对学习和维护自增广义跨领域样本的语义结构以增强模型的泛化能力感兴趣。与在多个源领域上训练的DGOD不同，Single-DGOD要仅使用一个单一源领域很难很好地泛化到多个目标领域。现有方法大多采用了与DGOD类似的处理方式，通过解耦合或压缩语义空间来学习域不变特征。然而，存在两个潜在的限制：1）由于极度稀缺的单领域数据，伪属性-标签相关性；2）通常忽略语义结构信息，即我们发现示例中的实例级语义关系的相似性对模型的泛化至关重要。在本文中，我们引入了用于Single-DGOD的复合领域的语义推理（SRCD）。",
