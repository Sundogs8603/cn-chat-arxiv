    "translated_abstract": "在地质碳封存监测中，当多模态时变数据昂贵且数值模拟成本高昂时，解决基于多物理的反问题可能具有挑战性。我们通过将计算成本低廉的学习代理与学习约束相结合来克服这些挑战。这种组合不仅能够大大改善对重要流体流动性质（渗透率）的反演，还能为反演多模态数据（包括井测量和主动源时变地震数据）提供一个自然的平台。通过添加学习约束，我们得到了一个计算可行的反演方法，其精度仍然准确。这通过包含一个经过训练的深度神经网络（称为归一化流），使模型迭代保持在分布内，从而保证了作为代理的经过训练的傅里叶神经算子的准确性，这些算子用于代替涉及部分计算昂贵的多相流模拟。",
