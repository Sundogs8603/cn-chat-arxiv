    "translated_abstract": "精确的负荷预测在众多领域都起着重要作用，但准确捕捉动力系统的复杂动态仍然是传统统计模型面临的挑战。因此，时间序列模型（ARIMA）和深度学习模型（ANN，LSTM，GRU等）经常被使用，并且通常能够取得更好的成功率。本文分析了最近开发的Transformer-based神经网络模型在负荷预测中的效果。Transformer模型有望改进负荷预测，因为它们能够通过其Attention机制学习到长期依赖关系。我们运用了几种元启发式算法，如差分进化，以寻找Transformer-based神经网络的最优超参数，以产生精确的预测。差分进化为非可微分、多目标或约束优化问题提供了可扩展、强健和全局的解决方案。我们的工作比较了所提出的基于Transformer的神经网络与其他模型在负荷预测上的性能。",
