    "abstract": "Existing fine-grained intensity regulation methods rely on explicit control through predicted emotion probabilities. However, these high-level semantic probabilities are often inaccurate and unsmooth at the phoneme level, leading to bias in learning. Especially when we attempt to mix multiple emotion intensities for specific phonemes, resulting in markedly reduced controllability and naturalness of the synthesis. To address this issue, we propose the CAScaded Explicit and Implicit coNtrol framework (CASEIN), which leverages accurate disentanglement of emotion manifolds from the reference speech to learn the implicit representation at a lower semantic level. This representation bridges the semantical gap between explicit probabilities and the synthesis model, reducing bias in learning. In experiments, our CASEIN surpasses existing methods in both controllability and naturalness. Notably, we are the first to achieve fine-grained control over the mixed intensity of multiple emotions.",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的细粒度情感强度调节方法依赖于通过预测的情感概率进行显式控制。然而，这些高层语义概率在音素级别上往往不准确且不平滑，导致学习中存在偏差。特别是当我们尝试在特定音素中混合多种情感强度时，会导致合成的可控性和自然度明显降低。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为“CASEIN”的层层级联的显式和隐式控制框架，该框架通过准确解离参考语音中情感流形，学习低语义级别的隐式表示。这种表示桥接了显式概率和合成模型之间的语义差距，减少了学习中的偏差。在实验中，我们的CASEIN在可控性和自然度方面超过了现有方法。值得注意的是，我们是第一个实现多种情感强度混合的细粒度控制的方法。",
