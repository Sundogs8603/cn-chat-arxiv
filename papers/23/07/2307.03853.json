    "translated_abstract": "最近机器学习模型的进展使得机器人能够在感知的非符号层次上识别物体（例如通过传感器融合和自然语言理解）。然而，这些主要基于黑盒子学习模型仍然缺乏解释性和可迁移性，并且需要大量的数据和计算需求。一个替代解决方案是通过专家反馈（即人在环路学习）在感知的非符号层次和概念的符号层次上教导机器人。本研究提出了这种以用户为中心的混合学习范式的概念，重点关注机器人手术情境。尽管最近的研究主要集中在非机器人和一些通用机器人领域的混合学习上，但很少有研究关注手术机器人领域。我们调查了相关的研究，重点关注人在环路手术机器人系统上的研究。这个评估突出了自主手术机器人的最突出解决方案和挑战。",
