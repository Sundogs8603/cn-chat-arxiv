    "translated_abstract": "对于对人工智能伦理感兴趣的研究人员、从业人员和政策制定者，他们需要更多综合的方法来研究和干预在多种背景和活动规模下的AI系统。本文提出了AI价值链作为一个满足这一需求的综合概念。为了更清晰地理论化AI价值链，并在概念上将其与供应链区分开来，我们回顾了战略管理、服务科学、经济地理学、行业、政府和应用研究文献中关于价值链和AI价值链的理论。然后，我们对涵盖AI价值链涉及的伦理问题的67个来源进行综合评估。根据我们综合评估的结果，我们提出了四个未来方向，研究人员、从业人员和政策制定者可以采取这些方向来推动在AI价值链上实现更具伦理的发展和使用。我们的综述和建议有助于推进研究议程的发展。",
