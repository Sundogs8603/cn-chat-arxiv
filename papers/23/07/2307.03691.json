    "abstract": "It is time-consuming to find the best product among many similar alternatives. Comparative sentences can help to contrast one item from others in a way that highlights important features of an item that stand out. Given reviews of one or multiple items and relevant item features, we generate comparative review sentences to aid users to find the best fit. Specifically, our model consists of three successive components in a transformer: (i) an item encoding module to encode an item for comparison, (ii) a comparison generation module that generates comparative sentences in an autoregressive manner, (iii) a novel decoding method for user personalization. We show that our pipeline generates fluent and diverse comparative sentences. We run experiments on the relevance and fidelity of our generated sentences in a human evaluation study and find that our algorithm creates comparative review sentences that are relevant and truthful.",

    "translated_abstract": "在众多相似的选择中找到最佳产品是非常耗时的。比较句子可以帮助我们以突出的方式对比一个项目与其他项目，在此过程中强调出重要特征。基于用户对一个或多个项目的评论及相关项目特征，我们生成比较评论句子来帮助用户找到最适合的产品。具体来说，我们的模型包括三个连续组件：（i）一个项目编码模块用于对项目进行编码比较，（ii）一个比较生成模块以自回归的方式生成比较句子，（iii）一种用于用户个性化的新型解码方法。我们展示了我们的流程能够生成流畅且多样的比较句子。我们进行了人类评估研究来验证我们生成的句子的相关性和真实性，结果表明我们的算法能够生成相关且真实的比较评论句子。",
