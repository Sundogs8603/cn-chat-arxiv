    "translated_abstract": "在实际机器学习中，保持训练动态在批量大小之间的一致性是一种重要工具，它能够在批量大小和墙钟时间之间进行权衡。这种权衡通常通过一个缩放规则来实现，例如，在随机梯度下降中，应该将学习率与批量大小呈线性关系。另一个实际机器学习的重要工具是模型指数移动平均（EMA），它是一个不接收梯度信息的模型副本，而是以一定的动量跟随其目标模型。这个模型EMA可以提高监督学习的稳健性和泛化性能，稳定伪标记，为自监督学习提供学习信号。之前的研究将模型EMA与优化分开处理，导致批量大小之间存在不同的训练动态和较低的模型性能。在这项工作中，我们提供了在存在模型EMA的情况下进行优化的缩放规则，并展示了其效果。",

    "en_tdlr": "This research provides a scaling rule for optimization in the presence of model Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), ensuring consistent training dynamics. This is crucial for balancing batch size and wall-clock time in practical machine learning. Model EMAs improve model performance, stabilize training, and provide a learning signal for self-supervised learning."
