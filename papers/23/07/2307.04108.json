    "abstract": "We study Proportional Response Dynamics (PRD) in linear Fisher markets where participants act asynchronously. We model this scenario as a sequential process in which in every step, an adversary selects a subset of the players that will update their bids, subject to liveness constraints. We show that if every bidder individually uses the PRD update rule whenever they are included in the group of bidders selected by the adversary, then (in the generic case) the entire dynamic converges to a competitive equilibrium of the market. Our proof technique uncovers further properties of linear Fisher markets, such as the uniqueness of the equilibrium for generic parameters and the convergence of associated best-response dynamics and no-swap regret dynamics under certain conditions.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了线性Fisher市场中的比例响应动力学（PRD），其中参与者以异步的方式行动。我们将这个情景建模为一个顺序过程，每一步中，对手选择一个子集的玩家来更新他们的出价，同时满足活性约束。我们证明了如果每个投标人在被对手选择的投标人组中时都个别地使用PRD更新规则，那么（在一般情况下）整个动态过程将会收敛到市场的竞争均衡。我们的证明方法还揭示了线性Fisher市场的其他性质，比如在一般参数下均衡的唯一性以及在某些条件下相关最佳响应动力学和无交换遗憾动力学的收敛性。",
