    "translated_abstract": "物理系统的时间演化由微分方程描述，这些方程依赖于能量和力等抽象量。传统上，这些量是基于位置和速度等可观测量的泛函导出的。发现这些控制符号定律是理解自然界相互作用的关键。本文介绍了一种哈密尔顿图神经网络（HGNN），它是一种通过轨迹直接学习系统动力学的物理强化图神经网络。我们展示了HGNN在n个弹簧、n个摆动系统、引力系统和二进制Lennard Jones系统上的性能，HGNN能够从少量数据中学习出与真实情况极佳一致的动力学。我们还评估了HGNN在更大系统大小以及混合弹簧-摆动系统上的推广能力，该系统是由两个独立训练的原始系统（弹簧和摆动）的组合构成。最后，我们还利用符号回归方法对学到的定律进行了推导和解释。",
