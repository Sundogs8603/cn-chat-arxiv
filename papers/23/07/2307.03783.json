    "translated_abstract": "基于抽象的技术是一种吸引人的方法，用于合成满足高层时间要求的正确构建的控制器。成功应用这些技术的主要障碍是内存需求，在控制器合成和控制器部署期间都存在内存需求问题。我们提出了一种使用神经网络表示来减轻基于抽象的技术的高内存需求的内存高效方法。为了执行达到避免规范的合成，我们提出了一种依赖于系统前向和后向动力学的压缩神经网络表示的即时算法。与通常的神经表示应用不同，我们的技术保持端到端过程的完整性。为了确保这一点，我们纠正了训练后神经网络的输出，使得修正后的输出表示在有限抽象方面是准确的。对于部署，我们提供了一种新颖的训练算法以完成部署。",
