    "translated_abstract": "对于单图像超分辨任务来说，追求超分辨图像的精细细节是具有挑战性的。本文提出了一种具有发际线细节的单图像超分辨网络（称为NLCUnet），包括三个核心设计。首先，我们引入了非局部注意机制，通过从整个图像区域学习来恢复局部细节。然后，我们发现通过现有工作训练的模糊核是不必要的。基于这一发现，我们创建了一个新的网络架构，将深度卷积与通道注意力集成，而不需要估计模糊核，结果导致性能提升。最后，为了使裁剪区域包含尽可能多的语义信息，我们提出了一种在中心512x512裁剪内部进行随机64x64裁剪的方法，而不是直接在整个2K大小的图像内进行随机裁剪。在基准DF2K数据集上进行的大量实验表明，我们的NLCUnet优于其他方法。",
