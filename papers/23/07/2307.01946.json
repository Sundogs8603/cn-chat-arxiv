    "translated_abstract": "心电图（ECG）是一种准确且广泛应用于诊断心血管疾病的工具。几十年来，ECG以印刷格式记录，并且将它们的数字化在算法性心电图诊断的机器学习模型训练中具有巨大潜力。物理性ECG存档面临退化风险，仅扫描印刷ECG是不够的，因为机器学习模型需要ECG时间序列数据。因此，将纸质ECG存档数字化和转换为时间序列数据至关重要。深度学习模型在图像处理方面显示出潜力。然而，具有参考时间序列的ECG存档稀缺是一个挑战。利用“数字孪生”的数据增强技术可能是一个潜在的解决方案。我们介绍了一种新的方法，以生成具有真实伪影的标准纸质ECG背景下的合成ECG图像。包括手写文本伪影、皱纹、折痕和视角转换等畸变。",

The method introduces realistic artifacts such as handwritten text artifacts, wrinkles, creases, and perspective transformation on standard paper-like ECG backgrounds. This approach addresses the challenge of the scarcity of reference time-series in synthetic ECG images."
