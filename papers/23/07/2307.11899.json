Federated learning enables model training across devices and silos while the training data remains within its security boundary, by distributing a model snapshot to a client running inside the boundary, running client code to update the model, and then aggregating updated snapshots across many clients in a central orchestrator.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了项目佛罗里达，这是一个系统架构和软件开发工具包（SDK），能够在异构设备生态系统中部署大规模的联邦学习（FL）解决方案。联邦学习是一种基于数据主权原则的机器学习方法，即通过将数据存储在其原始位置（无论是在终端设备上还是在分离的云存储分区中）来实现数据的隐私和安全性。联邦学习通过将模型快照分发给在安全边界内运行的客户端，并运行客户端代码更新模型，然后在中央协调者中聚合更新的快照，从而在设备和分区之间进行模型训练，而训练数据仍保留在其安全边界内。部署联邦学习解决方案需要实现复杂的隐私和安全机制以及可扩展的协调基础设施。规模和性能是一个重要问题，因为模型训练过程的效益受到这方面的影响。",
