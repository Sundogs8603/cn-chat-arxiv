    "translated_abstract": "自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）是一种终生性的神经发育障碍，影响社交交流和行为。通过研究功能磁共振成像（fMRI）基于大脑功能连接图可以帮助我们理解和诊断ASD，从而实现更有效的治疗。我们将大脑建模为一组大脑感兴趣区域（ROIs），ROIs形成社区，了解这些社区对ASD的诊断至关重要。一方面，基于Transformer的模型已被证明在多个任务中非常有效，包括fMRI连接图分析，以学习有用的ROIs表示。另一方面，现有的基于Transformer的模型平等地处理所有ROIs，并忽视了学习节点嵌入时社区特定关联的影响。为了填补这个空白，我们提出了一种新的方法，Com-BrainTF，这是一种层次化的局部-全局Transformer架构，用于学习自闭症预测任务的社区感知节点嵌入。",
