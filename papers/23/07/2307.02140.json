    "abstract": "Traditional Federated Learning (FL) follows a server-domincated cooperation paradigm which narrows the application scenarios of FL and decreases the enthusiasm of data holders to participate. To fully unleash the potential of FL, we advocate rethinking the design of current FL frameworks and extending it to a more generalized concept: Open Federated Learning Platforms. We propose two reciprocal cooperation frameworks for FL to achieve this: query-based FL and contract-based FL. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the feasibility of constructing an open FL platform from both technical and legal perspectives. We begin by reviewing the definition of FL and summarizing its inherent limitations, including server-client coupling, low model reusability, and non-public. In the query-based FL platform, which is an open model sharing and reusing platform empowered by the community for model mining, we explore a wide range of valuable topics, including the availability of up-to-d",

    "translated_abstract": "传统的联邦学习（FL）遵循服务器主导的合作模式，限制了FL的应用场景，并降低了数据持有者参与的热情。为了充分释放FL的潜力，我们主张重新思考当前FL框架的设计，并将其扩展为更通用的概念：开放联邦学习平台。我们提出了两个相互合作的FL框架：基于查询的FL和基于合同的FL。在这个综述中，我们从技术和法律的角度对构建开放的FL平台的可行性进行了全面的评估。我们首先回顾了FL的定义，并总结了其固有的局限性，包括服务器-客户端耦合、模型可重用性低和非公开性。在基于查询的FL平台中，这是一个由社区赋能的开放模型共享和重用平台，我们探讨了一系列有价值的主题，包括全球最新可用模型和模型的查询、服务质量保证和奖励机制。",
