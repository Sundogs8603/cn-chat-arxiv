    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了多类分类的通用速率，确定了所有假设类的最优速率（最多对数因子）。这推广了之前关于二元分类的结果，并解决了由Kalavasis、Velegkas和Karbasi（2022年）研究的具有有限标签数的多类设置中的一个开放问题。相反，我们的结果适用于任何可数的标签空间。即使对于有限的标签空间，我们的证明也能提供更精确的学习曲线上界，因为它们不依赖于标签数。具体地，我们证明任何类别只有当它没有无限的Littlestone树时才具有指数速率，而只有当它没有无限的Daniely-Shalev-Shwartz-Littleston（DSL）树时才具有（近似）线性速率，否则就需要任意慢的速率。DSL树是我们在这项工作中定义的一种新结构，其中树的每个节点由一个伪立方体给出。",
