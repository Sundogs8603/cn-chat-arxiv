    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）系统在重大领域部署时具有深远影响。它们可能加剧现有的不平等，创造新的歧视模式，并固化过时的社会构造。因此，ML系统开发的社会背景（即组织、团队、文化）是AI伦理领域和决策者进行积极研究和干预的焦点。本文关注一个常被忽视的社会背景方面：从业者与他们所依赖的工具之间的互动，以及这些互动在塑造ML实践和ML系统开发中的作用。特别地，通过对Stack Exchange论坛上提出的问题进行实证研究，探讨了在ML实践中使用交互式计算平台（如Jupyter Notebook和Google Colab）。我发现交互式计算平台在学习和协调实践中被广泛使用，构成了一种基础设施。",
