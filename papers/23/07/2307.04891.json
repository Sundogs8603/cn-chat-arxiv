    "abstract": "Recent work has applied supervised deep learning to derive continuous symmetry transformations that preserve the data labels and to obtain the corresponding algebras of symmetry generators. This letter introduces two improved algorithms that significantly speed up the discovery of these symmetry transformations. The new methods are demonstrated by deriving the complete set of generators for the unitary groups U(n) and the exceptional Lie groups $G_2$, $F_4$, and $E_6$. A third post-processing algorithm renders the found generators in sparse form. We benchmark the performance improvement of the new algorithms relative to the standard approach. Given the significant complexity of the exceptional Lie groups, our results demonstrate that this machine-learning method for discovering symmetries is completely general and can be applied to a wide variety of labeled datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "近期的研究已经应用监督深度学习推导连续对称变换以保持数据标签，并获得相应的对称生成元代数。本文引入了两种改进的算法，显著加快了对称变换的发现速度。通过推导出酉群U(n)和特殊李群G2，F4和E6的完整一组生成元来演示这些新方法。第三个后处理算法将找到的生成元呈现为稀疏形式。我们对比了新算法与标准方法的性能改善。鉴于特殊李群的复杂性，我们的结果表明，这种机器学习方法用于发现对称性是完全通用的，可以应用于各种带标签的数据集。",
