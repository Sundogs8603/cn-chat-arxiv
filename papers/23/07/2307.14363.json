    "translated_abstract": "心脏动态MRI是心脏功能评估的黄金标准，但其本身较慢的采集过程使得对加速采样的重建方法成为必要。已经提出了几种利用时空冗余的正则化方法来重建加速采样的心脏动态MRI。最近，还提出了基于有监督深度学习的方法来进一步加速采集和重建。然而，这些技术通常依赖于大型数据集进行训练，而这些数据集并不总是可用的。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于隐式神经场表示的无监督方法用于心脏动态MRI（称为NF-cMRI）。这种方法在体内低采样角度金属线圈多次获得中进行评估，得到了良好的图像质量，并且在空间和时间描述方面与最先进的重建技术相当或有所改进。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents an unsupervised method called NF-cMRI, which reconstructs accelerated cardiac cine MRI using neural field representation. Experimental results show that good image quality can be achieved at larger undersampling factors and temporal depiction can be improved."
