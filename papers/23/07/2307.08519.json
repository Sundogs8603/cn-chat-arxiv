    "abstract": "In this paper we provide a theoretical analysis of counterfactual invariance. We present a variety of existing definitions, study how they relate to each other and what their graphical implications are. We then turn to the current major question surrounding counterfactual invariance, how does it relate to conditional independence? We show that whilst counterfactual invariance implies conditional independence, conditional independence does not give any implications about the degree or likelihood of satisfying counterfactual invariance. Furthermore, we show that for discrete causal models counterfactually invariant functions are often constrained to be functions of particular variables, or even constant.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文对反事实不变性进行了理论分析。我们介绍了各种现有定义，研究了它们之间的关系以及它们的图形意义。然后我们转向反事实不变性围绕的主要问题，即它与条件独立性的关系如何？我们显示，虽然反事实不变性蕴含条件独立性，但条件独立性对满足反事实不变性的程度或可能性没有任何影响。此外，我们还显示对于离散因果模型，反事实不变的函数通常受到特定变量的限制，甚至是常数函数。",

It shows that counterfactual invariance implies conditional independence, while conditional independence does not affect the degree or likelihood of satisfying counterfactual invariance. The functions that are counterfactually invariant in discrete causal models are often constrained by specific variables."
