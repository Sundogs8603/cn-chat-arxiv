    "abstract": "This work presents an approach for combining household demographic and living standards survey questions with features derived from satellite imagery to predict the poverty rate of a region. Our approach utilizes visual features obtained from a single-step featurization method applied to freely available 10m/px Sentinel-2 surface reflectance satellite imagery. These visual features are combined with ten survey questions in a proxy means test (PMT) to estimate whether a household is below the poverty line. We show that the inclusion of visual features reduces the mean error in poverty rate estimates from 4.09% to 3.88% over a nationally representative out-of-sample test set. In addition to including satellite imagery features in proxy means tests, we propose an approach for selecting a subset of survey questions that are complementary to the visual features extracted from satellite imagery. Specifically, we design a survey variable selection approach guided by the full survey and image ",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种将家庭人口统计和生活水平调查问题与从卫星图像中提取的特征相结合的方法，以预测一个地区的贫困率。我们的方法利用从单一步骤提取特征的方法获取的可视特征，该方法应用于公开可用的10米/像素Sentinel-2地表反射卫星图像。这些可视特征与十个调查问题结合在一起，通过代理手段测试（PMT）估计一个家庭是否低于贫困线。我们展示了包含可视特征可以将贫困率估计的平均误差从4.09％降低到3.88％。除了在代理手段测试中包含卫星图像特征外，我们还提出了一种选择与从卫星图像中提取的可视特征互补的调查问题子集的方法。具体来说，我们设计了一种由全面的调查和图像指导的调查变量选择方法。",
