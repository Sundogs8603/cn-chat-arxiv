    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel machine learning approach to GDP prediction that incorporates volatility as a model weight. The proposed method is specifically designed to identify and select the most relevant macroeconomic variables for accurate GDP prediction, while taking into account unexpected shocks or events that may impact the economy. The proposed method's effectiveness is tested on real-world data and compared to previous techniques used for GDP forecasting, such as Lasso and Adaptive Lasso. The findings show that the Volatility-weighted Lasso method outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, providing policymakers and analysts with a valuable tool for making informed decisions in a rapidly changing economic environment. This study demonstrates how data-driven approaches can help us better understand economic fluctuations and support more effective economic policymaking.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的机器学习方法，将波动性作为模型权重引入国内生产总值（GDP）预测中。该方法专门设计用于准确预测GDP，同时考虑到可能影响经济的意外冲击或事件。通过对实际数据进行测试，并与以往用于GDP预测的技术（如Lasso和自适应Lasso）进行比较，表明波动性加权Lasso方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于其他方法，为决策者和分析师在快速变化的经济环境中提供了有价值的决策工具。本研究展示了数据驱动方法如何帮助我们更好地理解经济波动，并支持更有效的经济政策制定。",
