    "abstract": "Two level credibility-limited revision is a non-prioritized revision operation. When revising by a two level credibility-limited revision, two levels of credibility and one level of incredibility are considered. When revising by a sentence at the highest level of credibility, the operator behaves as a standard revision, if the sentence is at the second level of credibility, then the outcome of the revision process coincides with a standard contraction by the negation of that sentence. If the sentence is not credible, then the original belief set remains unchanged. In this paper, we propose a construction for two level credibility-limited revision operators based on Grove's systems of spheres and present an axiomatic characterization for these operators.",

    "translated_abstract": "两级可信度限制修正是一种非优先级修正操作。在进行两级可信度限制修正时，考虑两个层级的可信度和一个层级的不可信度。当通过最高层级可信度的句子进行修正时，操作符的行为类似于标准的修正；如果句子处于第二级可信度，则修正结果与通过否定该句子进行标准收缩的结果一致；如果句子不可信，则原始信念集保持不变。本文提出了一种基于Grove的球体系统的两级可信度限制修正操作符的构造，并对这些操作符进行了公理化刻画。",
