Our research is derived from the heuristic facts that tokens are created unequally in reflecting the meaning of generations by auto-regressive LLMs, i.e., some tokens are more relevant (or representative) than others, yet all the tokens are equally valued when estimating uncertainty. It is because of the linguistic redundancy where mostly a few keywords are sufficient to convey the meaning of a long sentence. We name these inequalities as generative inequalities and investigate how they affect uncertainty estimation.

    "translated_abstract": "虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言生成方面表现出了巨大的潜力，但是对于模型生成的不确定性的特征化仍然具有挑战性，即用户何时可以信任模型的输出。我们的研究基于一些启发性的事实，即在自回归的LLMs中，令牌在反映生成的含义方面是不平等的，即一些令牌比其他令牌更相关（或更具代表性），然而在估计不确定性时所有的令牌被等值对待。这是由于语言冗余，其中大部分情况下，只需要几个关键词就足以传达一个长句的含义。我们将这些不平等称为生成的不平等，并研究它们如何影响不确定性的估计。我们的结果揭示，相当数量的令牌和包含有限语义的句子，在估计不确定性时被同等或甚至更加重视。为了解决由生成的不平等引起的这些偏差，我们提出了共同转移关注点来更好地估计不确定性。",
