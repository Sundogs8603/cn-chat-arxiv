    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）在不同领域的应用迅速增长，特别是在安全关键领域，增加了对可靠ML组件的需求，即基于ML操作的软件组件。了解ML系统中的错误特征和维护挑战可以帮助这些系统的开发人员确定维护和测试工作的重点，通过提供对最容易出错的组件、最常见的错误等方面的见解。在本文中，我们研究了ML软件系统中错误的特征以及从维护角度看ML和非ML错误的区别。我们提取了447,948个GitHub仓库，这些仓库使用了三个最流行的ML框架，即TensorFlow、Keras和PyTorch。经过多次过滤，我们选择了关闭问题数量最多的前300个仓库。我们手动调查提取的仓库，排除非ML系统。我们的调查涉及手动检查。",
