    "abstract": "With a novel search algorithm or assortment planning or assortment optimization algorithm that takes into account a Bayesian approach to information updating and two-stage assortment optimization techniques, the current research provides a novel concept of competitiveness in the digital marketplace. Via the search algorithm, there is competition between the platform, vendors, and private brands of the platform. The current paper suggests a model and discusses how competition and collusion arise in the digital marketplace through assortment planning or assortment optimization algorithm. Furthermore, it suggests a model of an assortment algorithm free from collusion between the platform and the large vendors. The paper's major conclusions are that collusive assortment may raise a product's purchase likelihood but fail to maximize expected revenue.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种新颖的搜索算法或组合规划算法，该算法考虑了贝叶斯信息更新和两阶段组合优化技术，为数字市场中的竞争性概念提供了一种新的理解。通过搜索算法，在平台、供应商和平台的自有品牌之间存在竞争。本文提出了一个模型，并讨论了通过组合规划或组合优化算法在数字市场中如何产生竞争和勾结。此外，本文提出了一个无虚假合作的组合规划模型，以防止平台和大型供应商之间的勾结。本文的主要结论是，勾结的组合可能会提高产品购买的可能性，但无法最大化预期收入。而提出的组合规划方法在保持竞争力的同时最大化预期收入。",
