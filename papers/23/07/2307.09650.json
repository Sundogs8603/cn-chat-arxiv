    "translated_abstract": "网络社区具有独特的特征，建立社会规范，并在其成员之间展现着不同的动态。在线社区的活动往往导致具体的“离线”行动，对社会产生广泛影响（例如政治街头抗议和与性行为不当有关的规范）。尽管过去二十年中对社区动态、信息传播和在线协作进行了广泛研究，但对衡量在线社区在推动其议程方面有效性的定量研究很少。在这项工作中，我们研究了社区的效果（通过其在竞争性在线活动中的成功水平来衡量）和其成员之间的底层动态之间的对应关系。为此，我们定义了一个新任务：预测Reddit的r/place在线社区的成功水平--这是一个需要社区成员之间协作的大规模分布式实验。我们考虑了一系列成功水平的定义；每个定义表示社区在活动中的不同层面获取成功的能力。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过对Reddit的r/place在线社区进行分析，以预测在线社区在大规模协作活动中的成功水平，以及分析社区成员之间的底层动态对成功的影响。"
