    "translated_abstract": "对于电力转换器的性能建模，主流方法基本上是基于知识的，由于人力负担重和建模精度低而受困。最近出现的数据驱动技术通过从仿真数据中自动建模极大地减轻了对人的依赖。然而，由于未建模的寄生元件、不足的热磁模型、不可预测的环境条件等原因，模型的差异可能会发生。这些仅基于仿真的不准确的数据驱动模型无法代表实际世界中的实际性能，阻碍了它们在电力转换器建模中的应用。为了减轻模型差异并在实践中提高准确性，本文提出了一种新的基于实验增强的数据驱动建模方法(D2EA)，结合了仿真数据和实验数据。在D2EA中，仿真数据旨在建立基本的功能景观，实验数据则专注于匹配实际世界中的实际性能。实例化了D2EA方法",
