    "abstract": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle with transcribing child speech due to the lack of large child speech datasets required to accurately train child-friendly ASR models. However, there are huge amounts of annotated adult speech datasets which were used to create multilingual ASR models, such as Whisper. Our work aims to explore whether such models can be adapted to child speech to improve ASR for children. In addition, we compare Whisper child-adaptations with finetuned self-supervised models, such as wav2vec2. We demonstrate that finetuning Whisper on child speech yields significant improvements in ASR performance on child speech, compared to non finetuned Whisper models. Additionally, utilizing self-supervised Wav2vec2 models that have been finetuned on child speech outperforms Whisper finetuning.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动语音识别（ASR）系统在转录儿童语音时常常面临困难，这是因为缺乏大规模的儿童语音数据集，这些数据集是准确训练儿童友好型ASR模型所必需的。然而，存在着大量用于创建多语言ASR模型（如Whisper）的成年人语音数据集。我们的工作旨在探索这些模型是否可以适应儿童语音，以改进儿童ASR。此外，我们将Whisper的儿童适应性与自监督模型（如wav2vec2）的调优进行比较。我们证明将Whisper在儿童语音上进行调优可以显著提高儿童语音的ASR性能，而不调优的Whisper模型。此外，利用在儿童语音上进行调优的自监督wav2vec2模型超越了Whisper的调优性能。",
