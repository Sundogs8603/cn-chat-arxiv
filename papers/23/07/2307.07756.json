    "translated_abstract": "对于第五代新无线电（5G-NR）移动网络流量的分类是电信领域的一个新兴话题。它可以用于服务质量（QoS）管理和动态资源分配。然而，传统方法如深度数据包检查（DPI）无法直接应用于加密数据流。因此，需要研究新的实时加密流量分类算法来处理动态传输。本研究通过物理信道记录，使用新的实时加密5G Non-Standalone（NSA）应用级流量分类方法。由于特征数目庞大，基于决策树的梯度提升算法是一种可行的分类方法。我们生成了一个带有多个应用流量的受噪声限制的5G NSA追踪数据集。我们开发了一个新的流程，将物理信道记录序列转换为数值向量。我们测试了一组机器学习模型，并提出了一种新的模型进行流量分类。",
