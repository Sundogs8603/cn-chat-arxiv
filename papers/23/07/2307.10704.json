    "abstract": "The drastic growth of electric vehicles and photovoltaics can introduce new challenges, such as electrical current congestion and voltage limit violations due to peak load demands. These issues can be mitigated by controlling the operation of electric vehicles i.e., smart charging. Centralized smart charging solutions have already been proposed in the literature. But such solutions may lack scalability and suffer from inherent drawbacks of centralization, such as a single point of failure, and data privacy concerns. Decentralization can help tackle these challenges. In this paper, a fully decentralized smart charging system is proposed using the philosophy of adaptive multi-agent systems. The proposed system utilizes multi-armed bandit learning to handle uncertainties in the system. The presented system is decentralized, scalable, real-time, model-free, and takes fairness among different players into account. A detailed case study is also presented for performance evaluation.",

    "translated_abstract": "电动汽车和光伏的快速增长会带来新的挑战，如电流拥堵和电压限制违规。通过控制电动汽车的运行即智能充电，可以缓解这些问题。文献中已提出集中式智能充电解决方案，但这样的解决方案可能缺乏可扩展性，并且受到集中化的固有缺点的影响，如单一故障点和数据隐私问题。分散化可以帮助解决这些挑战。本文提出了一个完全分散化的智能充电系统，采用自适应多智能体系统的理念。所提出的系统利用多臂赌博学习来处理系统中的不确定性。该系统具有分散化、可扩展性、实时性、无模型性，并考虑了不同参与者之间的公平性。还提供了一个详细的案例研究以进行性能评估。",
