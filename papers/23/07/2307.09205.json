    "translated_abstract": "在许多强化学习任务中，智能体需要学习与许多不同类型的对象进行交互，并推广到未见过的对象组合和数量。通常，一个任务是以前学习的任务的组合（例如堆叠方块）。这些都是组成泛化的例子，通过组合以对象为中心的表示来解决复杂任务。最近的研究表明，在这些设置中，利用对象分解表示和层次抽象可以改善样本效率。另一方面，这些方法在对象属性方面没有充分利用分解的好处。在本文中，我们利用Dynamic Attribute FacTored RL (DAFT-RL)框架来解决这个问题。在DAFT-RL中，我们利用对象为中心的表示学习从视觉输入中提取对象。我们学习对它们进行分类，并推断它们的隐含参数。对于每个对象类，我们学习一个类模板图。",
