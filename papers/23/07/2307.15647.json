    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型容易受到输入图像的变化的干扰，这些变化在训练阶段没有观察到，导致无法预测的预测结果。在医学图像分析领域，检测这种非分布（OOD）图像尤其重要，因为可能的异常范围非常广泛。最近，出现了一种基于训练模型的中间特征的方法。这些方法可以分为两组：单层方法考虑在一个固定的、精心选择的层获得的特征图，和多层方法考虑由模型生成的特征映射的集合。虽然有希望，但这些算法的适当比较仍然缺失。在这项工作中，我们在大量的OOD（20种类型）上比较了各种基于特征的OOD检测方法，表示大约7800个3D MRIs。我们的实验揭示了两个现象。首先，多层方法可以提供更好的OOD检测性能。",
