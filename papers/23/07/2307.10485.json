    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）在理解和生成类似人类文本方面展示了卓越的能力，这可能会彻底改变金融行业。然而，现有的LLM在金融领域往往表现不佳，主要原因是一般文本数据与金融文本数据之间的差异。不幸的是，现有的金融文本数据集数量有限（大小较小），而第一个金融LLM（FinLLM）BloombergGPT是封闭的（只发布了训练日志）。鉴于此，我们的目标是通过Internet规模的金融数据将LLM民主化，由于数据来源多样、信噪比低和时间有效性高，这是一个开放性的挑战。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了一个开源和数据为中心的框架“金融生成预训练变压器（FinGPT）”，它可以自动收集和整理来自互联网上超过34个不同来源的实时金融数据。",
