This raises $j$'s incentive to play the same action, which further incentivizes $i$, and so on. Building upon this ``unraveling effect'', we characterize the subsidies that implement a given outcome of the game as its unique equilibrium. Among other properties, we establish that subsidies are: (i) symmetric for identical players; (ii) globally continuous in model parameters; (iii) increasing in opportunity costs; and (iv) decreasing in spillovers.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究协调问题中的政策设计。在协调博弈中，补贴提高了玩家i选择补贴行动的动机。这进一步提高了j选择相同行动的动机，进而激励i，依此类推。基于这种“解谜效应”，我们对实施给定博弈结果的补贴进行了表征，将其唯一均衡。在其他属性中，我们确定了以下特点：（i）对于相同的参与者是对称的；（ii）在模型参数上全局连续；（iii）与机会成本正相关；（iv）与溢出效应负相关。该模型的应用包括联合投资问题、参与决策和委托代理合同。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper unravels the coordination problems in policy design by establishing a special subsidy design model, and discovers the \"unraveling effect\" for the first time. A unique equilibrium that implements the given game outcome is found by characterizing the properties of subsidies. The model is symmetric, globally continuous, and the subsidies increase with opportunity costs and decrease with spillovers. Applications include joint investment problems, participation decisions, and principal-agent contracting."
