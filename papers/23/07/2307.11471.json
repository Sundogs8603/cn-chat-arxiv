    "translated_abstract": "视觉问答需要一个系统能够在给定图像和自然语言问题的情况下提供准确的自然语言回答。然而，广泛认识到先前的通用视觉问答方法往往倾向于记忆训练数据中存在的偏差，而不是学习正确的行为，例如在预测答案之前对图像进行定位。因此，这些方法通常在分布内表现出色，但在分布外表现较差。近年来，已经提出了各种数据集和去偏差方法来分别评估和增强视觉问答的鲁棒性。本文首次提供了一份关注这一新兴领域的全面调查。具体而言，我们首先从分布内和分布外的视角概述了数据集的发展过程。然后，我们研究了这些数据集采用的评估指标。第三，我们提出了一个分类法，介绍了数据集的发展过程、相似之处和差异之处。",
