    "abstract": "As collaborative robots (cobots) continue to gain popularity in industrial manufacturing, effective human-robot collaboration becomes crucial. Cobots should be able to recognize human actions to assist with assembly tasks and act autonomously. To achieve this, skeleton-based approaches are often used due to their ability to generalize across various people and environments. Although body skeleton approaches are widely used for action recognition, they may not be accurate enough for assembly actions where the worker's fingers and hands play a significant role. To address this limitation, we propose a method in which less detailed body skeletons are combined with highly detailed hand skeletons. We investigate CNNs and transformers, the latter of which are particularly adept at extracting and combining important information from both skeleton types using attention. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed approach in enhancing action recognition in assembly scenarios.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着协作机器人在工业制造领域日益受欢迎，有效的人机协作变得至关重要。协作机器人应该能够识别人体动作，以在组装任务中提供帮助并做出自主决策。为了实现这一目标，通常使用基于骨架的方法，因为它们能够适用于不同人员和环境。尽管身体骨架方法广泛用于动作识别，但在装配动作中，工人的手指和手部起到了重要作用，因此可能不够准确。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种方法，将较少详细的身体骨架与高度详细的手部骨架结合起来。我们研究了CNN和transformers，后者特别擅长使用注意力从两种骨架类型中提取和组合重要信息。本文展示了我们提出的方法在提高组装场景中的动作识别效果上的有效性。",
