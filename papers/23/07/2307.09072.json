    "translated_abstract": "使用数据驱动方法解决偏微分方程（PDEs）已经越来越常见。最近的算子学习范式的发展使得解决更广泛PDE相关问题成为可能。我们提出了一种算子学习方法，可以连续地解决时间相关的PDEs，而不需要任何时间离散化。所提出的方法名为DiTTO，受潜在扩散模型的启发。尽管扩散模型通常用于生成人工智能任务，但其时间条件机制对PDEs非常有用。扩散启发的框架与Transformer架构的元素相结合，以提高其能力。我们展示了新方法在多维度的广泛PDE上的有效性，包括1维Burgers方程，2维Navier-Stokes方程和2维和3维声波方程。DiTTO在这些问题的准确性方面取得了最先进的结果。",
