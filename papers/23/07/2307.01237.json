    "translated_abstract": "传播过程分类(DPC)是一种常用的时间图分类应用。DPC的目标是对由离散时间序列图表示的社区中的信息或疫情传播模式进行分类。最近，提出了一种基于储层计算的模型称为动态图回声状态网络(DynGESN)，该模型在处理具有较高有效性和较低计算成本的时间图方面表现出色。在本研究中，我们提出了一个将称为快照合并的新型数据增强策略与DynGESN相结合用于处理DPC任务的模型。在我们的模型中，快照合并策略旨在通过合并相邻的快照来形成新的快照，然后设置多个储层编码器以从合并的快照中捕获时空特征。在此之后，采用逻辑回归将求和池化的嵌入解码为分类结果。实验结果表明，我们的模型在几个基准数据集上取得了显著的改进。",
