    "translated_abstract": "在现代市场中影响公司定位和绩效的各种因素中，公司的资本结构有其自己的方式来表达自己的重要性。随着技术的快速变化，公司被推向一种使资本管理过程繁重的范式。因此，资本结构变化的研究为投资者提供了对公司行为和内在目标的深入了解。这些变化会因不同行业的公司而异。本研究考虑了银行业，该行业根据印度的运作规定有一个独特的资本结构。本文研究了一些公共部门银行的资本结构行为变化。从流行的资本结构理论中制定了一个理论框架，并相应地推导出假设。主要目的是验证选择银行在2011年至2022年的实时表现与不同理论的一致性。使用统计技术，如回归分析、相关分析和差异检验等，对数据进行了分析。",
