    "translated_abstract": "预测滑坡在时间上如何演变或者它们是否会发生故障是一项具有挑战性的任务，由于内部和外部的多种因素。尽管深度学习技术在应对这些挑战方面具有相当大的潜力，但它们缺乏可解释性，这削弱了它们产生的预测的可信度。最近发展的基于转换器的深度学习为用于预测滑坡提供了未被开发的可能性，具有前所未有的可解释性和非线性特征学习能力。在这里，我们提出了一个深度学习流程，能够全面预测滑坡的行为，它使用一个名为LFIT的基于转换器的网络从先前的知识和多源数据中学习复杂的非线性关系，识别最相关的变量，并展示对滑坡演化和时间模式的全面理解。通过整合先前的知识，我们提供了综合滑坡预测的改进，实现了可解释性。",
