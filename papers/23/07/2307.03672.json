    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了无需模拟的得分和流匹配（[SF]$^2$M），这是一种无需模拟的目标函数，用于推断给定来自任意分布的未配对源和目标样本的随机动力学。我们的方法推广了用于训练扩散模型的得分匹配损失和最近提出的用于训练连续归一化流的流匹配损失。[SF]$^2$M将连续时间随机生成建模解释为Schr\\\"odinger桥问题。它依赖于静态熵正则化最优传输或小批量近似，以有效地学习Schr\\\"odinger桥，而无需模拟学习过程。我们发现，与先前的基于模拟的方法相比，[SF]$^2$M更高效并提供了更准确的Schr\\\"odinger桥解决方案。最后，我们将[SF]$^2$M应用于从快照数据中学习细胞动力学的问题。值得注意的是，[SF]$^2$M是首个能够准确建模高维细胞动力学的方法。",
