    "translated_abstract": "用于辅助防御系统检测恶意行为的机器学习方法通常依赖于标记数据。在某些领域中，这种标记数据不可获取或不完整。实际上，这可能导致低检测率和高误报率，例如反洗钱系统。据估计，每年有1.7-4万亿欧元洗钱未被发现。我们提出了GANfather，一种生成具有恶意行为属性样本的方法，不需要标记要求。我们建议在典型的生成对抗网络（GANs）损失上引入额外的目标来奖励生成恶意样本。最终，我们的目标是将辨别器网络作为一种新颖且强大的防御系统，提高对非法活动的检测能力。可选地，我们可以鼓励生成器越过现有的检测系统。这种设置会暴露出辨别器的防御性弱点以进行修正。我们进行了评估。",
