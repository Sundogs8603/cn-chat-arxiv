    "translated_abstract": "神经符号化整合了符号知识表示和深度神经网络的学习能力。通过将一阶逻辑语言具有不可微性质的操作打造成实数张量之间可微分的逻辑张量网络（LTNs），可以将背景知识以逻辑公理的形式纳入其中。然而，仅有少量研究探讨了这种方法在提升零样本学习（ZSL）分类方面的潜在益处。本研究介绍了模糊逻辑视觉网络（FLVN），该网络在神经符号化LTN框架中构建了学习视觉-语义嵌入空间的任务。FLVN在网络中引入了类别层次（类和宏类）的先验知识，以及强大的高级归纳偏好。后者使得网络能够处理类级属性中的异常情况，并确保相同类别的图像之间的相似性，防止过早过拟合已见类别。",
