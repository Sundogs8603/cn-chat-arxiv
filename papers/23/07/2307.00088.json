This article argues for a new program of applied research in areas familiar to researchers in Bayesian methods in AI that are needed to ground the practice of Data Science by borrowing from AI techniques for model formulation that we term ``Decision Modelling.'' This article briefly reviews the formulation process as building a causal graphical model, then discusses the process in terms of six principles that comprise \\emph{Decision Quality}, a framework from the popular business literature. We claim that any successful applied ML modelling effort must include these six principles.  We explain how Decision Modelling combines a conventional machine learning model with an explicit value model. To give a specific example we show how this is done by integrating a model's ROC curve with a utility model.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着数据科学应用的爆炸性增长，该领域已经摆脱了其基础。本文认为，需要在对人工智能中的贝叶斯方法熟悉的领域进行新的应用研究，以借鉴人工智能技术来建立数据科学实践，并将其称为“决策建模”。本文简要回顾了建模过程，将其视为构建因果图模型，然后从流行的商业文献的角度讨论该过程的六个原则，构成了“决策质量”框架。我们认为任何成功的应用机器学习建模工作都必须包括这六个原则。我们解释了决策建模如何将传统的机器学习模型与显式价值模型结合起来。为了给出具体的例子，我们展示了如何将模型的ROC曲线与效用模型整合起来。",
