    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习系统越来越多地渗透到医疗保健、交通运输、军事和国家安全等高风险领域，人们对其可靠性产生了担忧。尽管取得了显著进展，但由于对抗攻击或环境变化，这些系统的性能可能显著降低，导致预测过于自信、无法检测输入故障以及在意外场景中无法泛化。本文提出了一种用于评估机器学习系统可靠性的整体评估方法。我们的框架评估了五个关键属性：分布内准确性、分布偏移鲁棒性、对抗鲁棒性、校准性和越界检测能力。我们还引入了一个可靠性得分来评估整个系统的可靠性。为了提供不同算法方法性能的见解，我们识别和分类了最先进的技术，然后使用真实世界的任务对其中的一些进行了评估。",
