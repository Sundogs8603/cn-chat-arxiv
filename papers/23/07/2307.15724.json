    "translated_abstract": "好奇心是许多有智能的自然生物的主要动机之一，通过具有可衡量智能水平的探索来实现更有效的学习。它使人类和许多动物能够通过寻找让他们感到惊讶的状态来高效地探索，以便学习更多他们所不知道的内容。因此，在保持好奇心的同时，他们能够学得更好。在机器学习领域，好奇心通常被结合到基于强化学习的算法中，作为一种内在的奖励。本研究提出了一种基于好奇心驱动的算法，通过从里程数据生成适当的电机速度来实现自主学习以控制飞行。通过我们提出的算法，四旋翼飞行器可以在控制偏航方向朝向所需位置的同时通过障碍物。为了实现这一目标，我们还提出了一种基于预测误差的新的好奇心方法。我们通过使用在线策略、离线策略和在线策略加噪音的测试来验证我们的算法。",
