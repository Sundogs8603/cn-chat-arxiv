    "translated_abstract": "我们提出一种称为有界组合重构的方法，用于解决基于Answer Set Programming（ASP）的组合重构问题。总体任务是研究源组合问题的解空间，并决定是否存在具有特殊属性的可行解序列。我们的recongo求解器覆盖了最近国际组合重构竞赛（CoRe Challenge 2022）的求解器类别中的所有指标。recongo在单引擎求解器方面的最短指标排名第一。在本文中，我们介绍了有界组合重构的设计和实现，并提出了独立集重构问题的ASP编码，这是最常研究的组合重构问题之一。最后，我们对CoRe Challenge 2022的所有实例进行了经验分析。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一种基于Answer Set Programming的有界组合重构方法，可以解决组合重构问题，并且在国际竞赛中取得了优异的成绩。",
