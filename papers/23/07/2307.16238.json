    "abstract": "The article tries to compare urban and rural literacy of fifteen selected Indian states during 1981 - 2011 and explores the instruments which can reduce the disparity in urban and rural educational attainment. The study constructs Sopher's urban-rural differential literacy index to analyze the trends of literacy disparity across fifteen states in India over time. Although literacy disparity has decreased over time, Sopher's index shows that the states of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, Maharashtra and even Karnataka faced high inequality in education between urban and rural India in 2011. Additionally, the Fixed Effect panel data regression technique has been applied in the study to identify the factors which influence urban-rural inequality in education. The model shows that the following factors can reduce literacy disparity between urban and rural areas of India: low fertility rate in rural women, higher percentages of rural females marrying after the age of 21 year",

    "translated_abstract": "本文试图比较印度选定的15个邦在1981-2011年期间城乡识字率，并探讨减少城乡教育取得差异的工具。研究构建了Sopher的城乡差异识字指数，分析了印度15个邦的识字差距趋势。尽管识字差距随着时间的推移有所减小，但Sopher指数显示，2011年安得拉邦、中央邦、古吉拉特邦、奥里萨邦、马哈拉施特拉邦甚至卡纳塔克邦在城乡教育方面面临较高的不平等。此外，本研究还应用了固定效应面板数据回归技术，以确定影响城乡教育不平等的因素。模型表明，以下因素可以减少印度城乡地区之间的识字差距：农村妇女生育率低，农村女性21岁后婚姻的比例较高。",

The findings show that while the literacy disparity has decreased over time, certain states such as Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Odisha, Maharashtra, and Karnataka still face high inequality in education. Furthermore, the study suggests that reducing rural fertility rates and promoting later marriages among rural women can help narrow the literacy gap between urban and rural areas in India."
