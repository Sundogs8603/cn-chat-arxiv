    "translated_abstract": "连接和自主驾驶车辆（CAVs）可以减少交通事故中的人为错误，提高道路效率，并执行从交货到智能城市监视等各种任务。实现这些好处需要CAVs能够自主导航到目标位置。为此，每个CAV的导航控制器必须利用传感器和无线系统收集的信息，进行纵向和横向移动的决策。然而，实现CAVs的自主导航需要将通信、控制和学习系统进行融合。本文的目标是明确揭示与这种融合相关的挑战，并提出解决方案来应对两个主要用例：非协调和协调CAVs。特别是，与非协调CAVs的导航相关的挑战包括稳定路径跟踪、抗击网络物理攻击的强大控制和自适应导航控制器设计。同时，当多个CAVs同时存在时...",
