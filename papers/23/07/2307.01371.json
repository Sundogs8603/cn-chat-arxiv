    "abstract": "Perception systems operate as a subcomponent of the general autonomy stack, and perception system designers often need to optimize performance characteristics while maintaining safety with respect to the overall closed-loop system. For this reason, it is useful to distill high-level safety requirements into component-level requirements on the perception system. In this work, we focus on efficiently determining sets of safe perception system performance characteristics given a black-box simulator of the fully-integrated, closed-loop system. We combine the advantages of common black-box estimation techniques such as Gaussian processes and threshold bandits to develop a new estimation method, which we call smoothing bandits. We demonstrate our method on a vision-based aircraft collision avoidance problem and show improvements in terms of both accuracy and efficiency over the Gaussian process and threshold bandit baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "感知系统作为整体自主栈的一个子组件运行，感知系统设计者常常需要在维护整体闭环系统的安全性的同时优化性能特性。因此，将高层安全要求化简为感知系统的组件级要求是非常有用的。在这项工作中，我们专注于在给定完全集成的闭环系统的黑盒模拟器的情况下，高效地确定一组安全的感知系统性能特性。我们结合了常见的黑盒估计技术（如高斯过程和阈值贝叶斯）的优点，开发了一种新的估计方法，称为平滑贝叶斯。我们在基于视觉的飞行器避碰问题上演示了我们的方法，并展示了与高斯过程和阈值贝叶斯基线相比，精度和效率上的改进。",
