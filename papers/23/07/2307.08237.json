    "translated_abstract": "甲氧西林耐药金黄色葡萄球菌（MRSA）是一种对某些抗生素具有耐药性的细菌，使得预防MRSA感染变得困难。在数十年的努力中，已经提出了许多研究以从观察数据中估计亲密接触（治疗）对MRSA感染（结果）的因果效应。在这个问题中，治疗分配机制起着关键作用，因为它决定了缺失反事实的模式，这是因果效应估计的基本挑战。大多数现有的用于因果效应学习的观察性研究假设每个单位的治疗都是个体分配的。但是，在许多情况下，治疗是对图中连接的单位进行成对分配的，即不同单位的治疗是纠缠的。忽视纠缠的治疗可能妨碍因果效应的估计。在本文中，我们研究了在图中纠缠治疗的情况下的因果效应估计问题。",
