    "translated_abstract": "最近许多关于一阶方法(FOMs)的研究都集中在具有线性和/或非线性函数约束的复合非凸非光滑优化上。已经为这些方法建立了上限(或最坏情况)复杂度的界限。然而，除了一些特殊的光滑非凸情况外，它们的最优性几乎不能得到保证，因为只有很少的下界是已知的。在本文中，我们首次尝试建立用于解决一类具有线性约束的复合非凸非光滑优化的FOMs的复杂度下界。假设两个不同的一阶预言机，我们建立了FOMs的复杂度下界，以产生一个问题（及其改写）的(接近)$\\epsilon$-稳定点，其中考虑问题类别的任何给定容差$\\epsilon>0$。此外，我们使用两个预测机中更宽松的一个提出了一种不精确的近端梯度(IPG)方法。该IPG的预言机复杂度，用于找到一个(接近)。epsilon-稳定点。",
