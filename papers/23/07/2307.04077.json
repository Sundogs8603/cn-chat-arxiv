    "translated_abstract": "隐私和安全迅速成为了首要的设计限制条件。现在用户要求在谁可以看到他们的数据（机密性）以及如何使用它（控制）方面获得更多的保护。现有的用于安全的加密技术不够完善：它们在存储或通信时保护数据，但必须解密来进行计算。幸运的是，存在一种被称为保护隐私计算（PPC）的新计算范式。新兴的PPC技术可以用于安全的外包计算，或使两个参与方能够进行计算而不泄露用户的秘密数据。尽管在数字时代，这些技术具有革命性的潜力来改变用户的保护，但由于计算、通信和存储开销过高，实现一直受到限制。本文回顾了最近关于使用神经网络中的私密推理（PI）来解决各种PPC开销的努力。首先，介绍了问题和各种技术，包括",
