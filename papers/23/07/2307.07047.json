    "abstract": "Applications that could benefit from automatic understanding of human-human conversations often come with challenges associated with private information in real-world data such as call center or clinical conversations. Working with protected data also increases costs of annotation, which limits technology development. To address these challenges, we propose DIALGEN, a human-in-the-loop semi-automated dialogue generation framework. DIALGEN uses a language model (ChatGPT) that can follow schema and style specifications to produce fluent conversational text, generating a complex conversation through iteratively generating subdialogues and using human feedback to correct inconsistencies or redirect the flow. In experiments on structured summarization of agent-client information gathering calls, framed as dialogue state tracking, we show that DIALGEN data enables significant improvement in model performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "需要自动理解人际对话的应用通常面临与真实世界数据中的私人信息，如呼叫中心或临床对话，有关的挑战。处理受保护的数据也会增加注释成本，从而限制技术发展。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了DIALGEN，一种人机半自动对话生成框架。DIALGEN使用一种语言模型（ChatGPT），可以遵循架构和风格规范，生成流利的对话文本，通过迭代生成子对话并使用人工反馈来纠正不一致或重定对话的流程。在将代理-客户信息收集呼叫归纳为对话状态跟踪的结构化概括实验中，我们展示了DIALGEN数据能够显著提高模型性能。",
