    "translated_abstract": "组合目标分配和路径规划问题（TAPF）要求同时为智能体分配目标并为其规划从起始位置到目标位置的无碰撞路径。作为解决TAPF问题的主要方法，基于冲突搜索与目标分配（CBS-TA）利用K最佳目标分配创建多个搜索树，并利用冲突基础搜索（CBS）解决每个搜索树中的碰撞问题。尽管能够找到最优解，但由于在多个树中重复解决碰撞问题和计算高昂的K最佳分配，CBS-TA在可扩展性方面存在问题。因此，我们开发了增量目标分配CBS（ITA-CBS）来解决这两个计算瓶颈。ITA-CBS只生成单个搜索树，并在搜索过程中通过逐步计算新的最佳分配来避免计算K最佳分配。理论上，我们证明ITA-CBS能够保证找到最优解，并在实践中进行了验证。",
