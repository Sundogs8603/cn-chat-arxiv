    "translated_abstract": "公众人物在社交媒体上受到了不成比例的滥用，这对他们在公众生活中的积极参与产生了影响。自动化系统可以大规模识别滥用，但标记训练数据既昂贵又复杂，可能会造成伤害。因此，系统的高效性和通用性是可取的，可以处理在线滥用的共享和特定方面。我们探索交叉群体文本分类的动态，以了解训练在一个领域或人口统计上的分类器在其他领域或人口统计上的转移情况，从而构建更通用的滥用分类器。我们使用我们的创新DODO数据集，其中包含28,000个标记条目，在跨领域（体育和政治）和跨人口（女性和男性）的四个领域-人口对中，微调语言模型来分类针对公众人物的推文。我们发现，（i）少量多样的数据对通用化和模型适应非常有益；（ii）模型的转移更容易。",
