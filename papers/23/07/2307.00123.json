    "translated_abstract": "持续学习已经成为近年来机器学习和人机交互领域的重要研究方向，旨在让机器人能够在与人类的长期交互中不断学习其环境。然而，大多数持续学习研究都是以机器人为中心，旨在开发能够快速学习静态数据集中新信息的持续学习算法。本文采用以人类为中心的方法来研究持续学习，以了解人类如何在长期时间内教授持续学习机器人，以及他们的教学风格是否存在变化。我们进行了一项与40名参与者的面对面研究，他们与一个持续学习机器人进行了200次交互。本次研究采用了两种不同的持续学习模型，部署在一个Fetch移动操作机器人上。对研究中收集的数据进行了详尽的定性和定量分析，结果显示存在显著的变化。",
