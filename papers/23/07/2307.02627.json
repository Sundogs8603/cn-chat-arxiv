    "abstract": "Transitive proxy voting (or \"liquid democracy\") is a novel form of collective decision making, often framed as an attractive hybrid of direct and representative democracy. Although the ideas behind liquid democracy have garnered widespread support, there have been relatively few attempts to model it formally. This paper makes three main contributions. First, it proposes a new social choice-theoretic model of liquid democracy, which is distinguished by taking a richer formal perspective on the process by which a voter chooses a proxy. Second, it examines the model from an axiomatic perspective, proving (a) a proxy vote analogue of May's Theorem and (b) an impossibility result concerning monotonicity properties in a proxy vote setting. Third, it explores the topic of manipulation in transitive proxy votes. Two forms of manipulation specific to the proxy vote setting are defined, and it is shown that manipulation occurs in strictly more cases in proxy votes than in classical votes.",

    "translated_abstract": "过渡性代理选举（或\"流动民主\"）是一种新颖的集体决策形式，通常被认为是直接民主和代议制的有吸引力的混合形式。尽管流动民主的理念获得了广泛支持，但对其进行正式建模的尝试相对较少。本文提出了三个主要贡献。首先，提出了一个新的社会选择理论模型，该模型在选民选择代理的过程中采用了更丰富的正式观点。其次，从公理的角度审视该模型，证明了（a）一个关于代理投票的May定理的类比和（b）代理投票设置中关于单调性属性的不可能性结果。第三，探讨了过渡性代理投票中的操纵问题。定义了代理投票设置下的两种特定形式的操纵，并且证明了在代理投票中操纵发生的情况比传统选举中更多。",
