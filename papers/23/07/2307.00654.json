    "translated_abstract": "多目标推荐系统（MORS）根据多个（可能相互冲突的）目标为用户提供建议。当系统优化单个用户级别的结果时，它会根据用户对不同目标的倾向来定制建议。因此，理解用户对每个目标的精细需求的能力至关重要。在本文中，我们介绍了一项用户研究的结果，我们监控了用户与推荐物品的互动方式，以及他们自己对相关性、新奇性和多样性目标的倾向。该研究被分为多个会话，用户评估了源自仅相关性单目标基准以及MORS的推荐列表。我们发现，尽管基于MORS的推荐吸引了较少的选择，但其在早期阶段的存在对用户在后期的满意度至关重要。令人惊讶的是，用户自称愿意与新颖和多样性进行互动的意愿",
