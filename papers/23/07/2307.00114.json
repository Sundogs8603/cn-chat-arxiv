Further, performing the same task every day, in the same way, can become boring for the robot's user(s), therefore, assistive robots must find creative ways to perform tasks in the household. In this paper, we present a cognitive architecture for a household assistive robot that can learn personalized breakfast options from its users and then use the learned knowledge to set up a table for breakfast. The architecture can also use the learned knowledge to create new breakfast options over a longer period of time. The proposed cognitive architecture combines state-of-the-art perceptual learning algorithms, computational implementation of cognitive models of memory encoding and learning, a task planner for picking and placing objects in the household, a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the user and a novel approach for creating new breakfast options using the learned knowl",

    "translated_abstract": "为了帮助用户完成家务任务，机器人首先必须从用户那里学习任务。此外，每天以相同方式执行相同任务会让机器人的使用者感到无趣，因此辅助机器人必须找到创造性的方法来完成家务任务。在本文中，我们提出了一个认知架构，借助此架构，家庭辅助机器人能够从用户那里学习个性化的早餐选择，并使用所学知识来准备早餐。该架构还可以利用所学知识在较长时间内创建新的早餐选择。所提出的认知架构结合了最先进的感知学习算法、计算实施的认知记忆编码和学习的模型、一个用于在家庭中拾取和放置物体的任务规划器、与用户交互的图形用户界面(GUI)以及使用所学知识创建新早餐选择的新方法。",
