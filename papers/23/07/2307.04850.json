    "translated_abstract": "SHAP框架通过计算特征重要性提供了一种解释模型预测的方法。受金融应用的启发，我们引入了Top-k识别问题（TkIP），其目标是识别具有最高SHAP值的k个特征。虽然任何计算带有不确定性估计的SHAP值的方法（如KernelSHAP和SamplingSHAP）都可以轻松适应TkIP的解决，但这样做会导致样本效率低下。我们的工作目标是在解决TkIP的背景下提高现有方法的样本效率。我们的关键洞察是TkIP可以作为一个Explore-m问题进行建模，该问题与多臂赌博机（MAB）相关的问题已经得到了深入研究。这种联系使我们能够通过利用MAB文献中的两种技术来提高样本效率：（1）更好的停止条件（停止采样），识别PAC（可能近似正确）保证已经满足；（2）一种贪婪采样方案。",
