    "translated_abstract": "对于多模态磁共振（MR）脑肿瘤图像分割，目前的方法通常直接从输入图像中提取判别特征，用于确定和定位肿瘤亚区类别。然而，由于肿瘤亚区的相互包含导致的信息重叠往往被忽视。此外，现有方法通常不会针对单一肿瘤亚区特征进行量身定制的努力。为此，提出了一种基于脑肿瘤原型驱动和多专家集成的多模态MR脑肿瘤分割方法。它可以在肿瘤原型的指导下突出显示每个肿瘤亚区的特征。具体而言，为了获得具有完整信息的原型，我们提出了一种相互传输机制，将不同模态的特征相互转移，以解决单一模态特征信息不足引起的问题。此外，我们设计了一种基于原型驱动的特征表示和融合方法。",
