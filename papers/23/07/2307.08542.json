    "translated_abstract": "共单调性（“相同变化”）的随机变量最小化了对冲可能性，在许多领域得到广泛应用。传统公理的共单调限制导致了决策模型中的重大发明，包括Gilboa和Schmeidler的模糊模型。本文研究了反单调性（“相反变化”），它是共单调性的自然对应物，最小化了杠杆作用的可能性。令人惊讶的是，传统公理的反单调限制通常并不产生新的模型，而是给出现有模型的广义化公理。因此，我们推广了：（a）通过柯西方程对线性泛函的经典公理化；（b）通过无套利原则对即时无风险定价；（c）通过簿记来描述主观概率；（d）Anscombe-Aumann的期望效用；（e）在Savage的主观期望效用中的风险规避。在每种情况下，我们的广义化公理化展示了经典公理的最关键测试在反单调性情况下的位置。",

By imposing antimonotonic restrictions on traditional axioms, the authors generalize existing models and provide key insights into the critical tests of classical axioms in the antimonotonic case."
