    "abstract": "A curriculum is a planned sequence of learning materials and an effective one can make learning efficient and effective for both humans and machines. Recent studies developed effective data-driven curriculum learning approaches for training graph neural networks in language applications.

In this paper, we propose a new perspective on curriculum learning by introducing a novel approach that builds on graph complexity formalisms (as difficulty criteria) and model competence during training. The model consists of a scheduling scheme which derives effective curricula by accounting for different views of sample difficulty and model competence during training. The proposed solution advances existing research in curriculum learning for graph neural networks with the ability to incorporate a fine-grained spectrum of graph difficulty criteria in their training paradigms.

    "translated_abstract": "课程学习是一种计划好的学习材料序列，有效的课程学习可以使人类和机器的学习更高效和有效。最近的研究在语言应用中为训练图神经网络开发了有效的数据驱动的课程学习方法。然而，现有的课程学习方法在训练范式中通常只使用单一的困难度标准。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的课程学习视角，通过引入一种建立在图复杂性形式化（作为困难度标准）和模型能力之上的新方法来进行课程学习。该模型包括一个调度方案，通过考虑样本困难度和模型能力的不同视角在训练期间推导出有效的课程。所提出的解决方案在图神经网络的课程学习研究中取得了进展，能够在训练范式中纳入细粒度的图困难度标准。",
