    "abstract": "The use of machine learning in algorithmic trading systems is increasingly common. In a typical set-up, supervised learning is used to predict the future prices of assets, and those predictions drive a simple trading and execution strategy. This is quite effective when the predictions have sufficient signal, markets are liquid, and transaction costs are low. However, those conditions often do not hold in thinly traded financial markets and markets for differentiated assets such as real estate or vehicles. In these markets, the trading strategy must consider the long-term effects of taking positions that are relatively more difficult to change. In this work, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm that trades based on signals from a learned predictive model and addresses these challenges. We test our algorithm on 20+ years of equity data from Bursa Malaysia.",

    "translated_abstract": "在算法交易系统中，机器学习的应用越来越普遍。在一个典型的设置中，使用监督学习来预测资产的未来价格，这些预测驱动着简单的交易和执行策略。当预测具有足够的信号、市场流动性足够大且交易成本较低时，这种方法非常有效。然而，在交易较少的金融市场和房地产或汽车等不同类资产市场中，这些条件通常不成立。在这些市场中，交易策略必须考虑到采取相对较难改变的仓位对长期影响。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于强化学习算法的交易算法，该算法根据学习到的预测模型的信号进行交易，并解决了这些挑战。我们在马来西亚交易所的20多年股票数据上测试了我们的算法。",
