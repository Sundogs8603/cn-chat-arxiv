    "translated_abstract": "放射学报告是放射科医生与其他医务人员之间沟通的重要部分，但其可能耗时且容易出错。其中一种减轻这种情况的方法是结构化报告，它比自由文本报告更节约时间并且能够实现更精确的评估。然而，关于自动化结构化报告的研究有限，并且目前没有公开的基准用于评估和比较不同方法。为了弥补这一空白，我们介绍了Rad-ReStruct，这是一个新的基准数据集，提供了细粒度的、按层次排序的X光图像的结构化报告形式的注释。我们将结构化报告任务建模为分层视觉问答(VQA)，并提出了hi-VQA，一种考虑先前提问和回答的上下文以填充结构化放射学报告的新方法。我们的实验证明hi-VQA在医学VQA基准测试中取得了与最先进方法相竞争的性能。",
