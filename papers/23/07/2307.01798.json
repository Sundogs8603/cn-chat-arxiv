    "translated_abstract": "在多模态非对比度磁共振成像（NCMRI）上同时进行肝肿瘤的多指标定量、分割和不确定性估计对于准确诊断至关重要。然而，现有的方法缺乏有效的多模态NCMRI融合机制和准确的边界信息捕捉机制，使得这些任务具有挑战性。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一个统一的框架，即基于边缘感知的多任务网络（EaMtNet），用于在多模态NCMRI上关联肝肿瘤的多指标定量、分割和不确定性。EaMtNet采用两个平行的CNN编码器和Sobel滤波器来提取局部特征和边缘图像。新设计的边缘感知特征聚合模块（EaFA）用于特征融合和选择，通过捕捉特征和边缘图像之间的长程依赖使网络具有边缘感知能力。多任务学习利用预测差异来估算不确定性并改善模型性能。",
