    "abstract": "As robots become increasingly prevalent in work-oriented collaborations, trust has emerged as a critical factor in their acceptance and effectiveness. However, trust is dynamic and can erode when mistakes are made. Despite emerging research on trust repair in human-robot interaction, significant questions remain about identifying reliable approaches to restoring trust in robots after trust violations occur. To address this problem, my research aims to identify effective strategies for designing robots capable of trust repair in human-robot interaction (HRI) and to explore the underlying mechanisms that make these strategies successful. This paper provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and key components of the trust repair process in HRI, as well as a summary of my current published work in this area. Additionally, I discuss the research questions that will guide my future work and the potential contributions that this research could make to the field.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着机器人在工作合作中的普及，信任已成为它们被接受和发挥效能的关键因素。然而，信任是动态的，当出现错误时，信任会被侵蚀。尽管在人机交互中的信任修复上有不断涌现的研究，但仍然存在关于如何在机器人违背信任后恢复信任的可靠方法的重要问题。为了解决这个问题，我的研究旨在确定在人机交互中设计能够修复信任的机器人的有效策略，并探索这些策略成功的潜在机制。本文概述了人机交互中信任修复过程的基本概念和关键组成部分，以及我在这个领域的当前已发表工作的总结。此外，我还讨论了将指导我未来工作的研究问题以及这项研究可能对该领域做出的贡献。",
