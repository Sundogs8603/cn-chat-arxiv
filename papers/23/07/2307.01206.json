    "translated_abstract": "在大规模现实世界的机器学习应用中，模型演进和数据的持续可用性是两个常见现象，例如广告和推荐系统。为了适应这种情况，实际系统通常会使用所有可用数据进行重新训练，并使用最近可用的数据进行在线学习，以期定期更新模型以提高性能。本文提出了一种名为“置信度排序”的新型框架，将优化目标设计为具有两个不同模型的排序函数。我们的置信度排序损失允许直接优化不同凸替代函数（例如AUC和准确度）的logits输出，具体取决于目标任务和数据集。通过我们提出的方法，在公共和工业数据集的CTR预测任务中，我们的实验表明引入置信度排序损失可以胜过所有基线方法。该框架已在京东广告系统中部署，以提供服务。",
