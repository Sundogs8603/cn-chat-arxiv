    "translated_abstract": "人机交互（HRI）中一个重要的开放问题是什么时候一个代理应该决定进行通信，尤其是在合作任务中。感知控制理论（PCT）告诉我们，代理可以通过共享相同的“意图”来合作完成一个联合任务，从而将完成任务所需的工作分布在不同的代理之间。即使对于不具备相同能力和目标可观测的代理，只要其组合行动足以完成任务且搜索空间中没有局部最小值，合作任务也可以在没有任何通信的情况下完成。然而，对于包含局部极小值的任务，只有在适当时刻至少一个代理改变其意图，才能达到全局解，而这只能通过适时的通信来实现。换句话说，在合作任务中，通过适时的通信可以促使代理在适当的时刻调整其意图。",
