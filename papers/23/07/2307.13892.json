    "translated_abstract": "作为我们参加AI for Global Climate Cooperation (AI4GCC)竞赛的第三项跟踪任务的提交，我们针对RICE-N气候经济模拟提出了一种谈判协议。我们的提议通过受到碳边境调整机制(CBAM)和气候俱乐部(CC)启发的方法来应对碳泄漏的挑战。我们通过将模拟结果与代表性浓度路径(RCP)和共享社会经济路径(SSP)进行比较，证明了我们方法的有效性。我们的协议导致了与RCP 3.4/4.5和SSP 2相当的温度上升。此外，我们对我们的协议的世界贸易组织合规性、行政和政治可行性以及伦理关切进行了分析。我们意识到我们的提议可能会对最不发达国家造成伤害，因此我们建议采取特定的纠正措施，避免加剧现有的不平等，例如技术共享和财富再分配。未来的研究应该改进...",
