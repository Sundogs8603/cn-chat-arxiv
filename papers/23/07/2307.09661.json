    "translated_abstract": "在数字孪生背景下，结构健康监测（SHM）构成了基于状态的维护的支柱，促进了虚拟和物理资产之间的互连。引导波传播（GWP）通常用于SHM中的结构检测。然而，GWP对结构材料性质的变化非常敏感，容易导致错误告警。在这个方向上，经常应用不确定性量化（UQ）来提高预测的可靠性。计算力学是模拟GWP的有用工具，通常用于UQ。即便如此，UQ方法的应用需要大量的模拟，而大规模的瞬态数值GWP解决方案会增加计算开销。常用的减阶模型（ROMs）通常用于在有限的时间内提供数值结果。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于机器学习（ML）的ROM，即BO-ML-ROM，以减少与计算时间相关的成本",
