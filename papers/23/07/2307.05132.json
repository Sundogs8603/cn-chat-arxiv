    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习（SSL）是从大量多样化、质量不一致的语音数据中学习得到的一种有效的语音表示方法，不需要转录。先前的研究表明，SSL是一个有效的中间表示方法，在两阶段的文本转语音（TTS）中，无论是针对朗读语音还是自发语音。然而，尚不清楚哪种SSL以及每个SSL模型中的哪一层适合于自发语音的TTS。为了弥补这个不足，我们扩大了对自发语音TTS中SSL的比较范围，包括6种不同的SSL和每种SSL中的3层。此外，SSL在预测合成语音的主观质量评分（MOS）方面也显示出潜力，但这只在朗读语音MOS预测中进行过研究。我们扩展了之前用于评分朗读语音合成的基于SSL的MOS预测框架，并在合成的自发语音上评估其性能。所有实验在两个不同的自发语音数据集上重复进行。",
