    "translated_abstract": "经济学中一个核心问题是自动化是否会取代人力劳动并降低生活水平。尽管先前的研究通常将这个问题视为人力劳动与机器之间的竞争，但我们将其视为人力消费者与人力供应者之间的竞争。具体而言，我们观察到人类的需求倾向于长尾分布，即一个包含大量利基产品的长列表，而这些产品在总需求上是具有重要地位的。反过来，这些长尾分布反映在满足这些需求的商品和服务中。在此背景下，我们提出了一个基于长尾分布的经济活动的理论模型，其中新型利基产出的需求创新与成熟产出的供应自动化创新相互竞争。我们的模型以仅四个参数（供应和需求的创新速度、长尾分布的指数和初始值）为基础，得出了自动化和劳动份额的分析表达式和渐近线。我们验证了该模型的有效性。",

The model balances the shares of automation and labor through innovation in demand and supply."
