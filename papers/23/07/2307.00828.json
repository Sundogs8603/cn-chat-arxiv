    "translated_abstract": "在控制系统中打破安全约束可能导致潜在风险，造成意外的成本或灾难性损害。然而，不确定性普遍存在，即使是相似的任务也是如此。在本文中，我们开发了一种新颖的自适应安全控制框架，它集成了元学习、贝叶斯模型和控制限制函数（CBF）方法。具体而言，借助CBF方法，我们通过统一的自适应贝叶斯线性回归（ABLR）模型学习内在和外部的不确定性，该模型由前馈神经网络（NN）和贝叶斯输出层组成。利用元学习技术，我们使用从历史相似任务收集的数据对NN权重和ABLR模型的先验进行预训练。对于一个新的控制任务，我们通过少量样本来改进元学习模型，并将悲观置信区间引入CBF约束，以确保安全控制。此外，我们提供了理论准则，以确保在控制过程中的概率安全性。",
