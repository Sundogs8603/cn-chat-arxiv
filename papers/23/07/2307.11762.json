    "translated_title": "基于相似性的记忆增强联合实体和关系抽取",
    "translated_abstract": "文档级联合实体和关系抽取是一个具有挑战性的信息提取问题，需要一个统一的方法，在其中一个单一的神经网络执行四个子任务：提及检测，共指解析，实体分类和关系抽取。现有方法通常采用顺序多任务学习方法，在其中任意分解导致当前任务仅依赖于前一个任务，忽略了它们之间可能存在的更复杂关系的可能性。在本文中，我们提出了一个具有双向内存依赖关系的多任务学习框架，以解决这些缺点并更准确地执行联合问题。我们的实证研究表明，所提出的方法优于现有方法，并在BioCreative V CDR语料库上实现了最先进的结果。",
