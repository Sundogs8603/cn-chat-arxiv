Sharing annotated datasets is essential to enable the development of more advanced computer models for ED within the research community. In this paper, we describe our experience establishing a process to create a multimodal annotated dataset featuring children with a level 1 diagnosis of autism.

    "translated_abstract": "自动情绪检测（ED）旨在构建系统以自动识别用户的情绪。这一领域有潜力提升人机交互体验，为用户创造个性化的体验。然而，ED系统在自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）患者身上表现出较差的性能。因此，有必要创建针对自闭症患者情绪表达方式的ED系统。先前的研究虽然创建了针对ASD儿童的ED系统，但未共享所得到的数据集。共享注释数据集对于促进研究社区内更先进的计算机模型对ED的发展至关重要。在本文中，我们描述了我们建立一个流程来创建一个多模态注释数据集，其中包括自闭症1级诊断的儿童。此外，我们介绍了CALMED（Children, Autism, Multimodal, Emotion, Detection），这是一个多模态的情绪检测数据集，包括年龄在8-12岁的自闭症儿童的音频和视频特征。",
