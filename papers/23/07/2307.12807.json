    "translated_abstract": "语义类型是一种比原子类型（如字符串或整数）更强大和详细的描述数据的方式。它们在列之间和与现实世界概念之间建立连接，提供了更加细致和精细的信息，对于自动化数据清洗、模式匹配和数据发现等任务非常有用。已有的在大文本语料库上训练的深度学习模型已成功地实现了关系数据的单列语义类型预测。然而，在这项工作中，我们提出了将语义类型预测问题扩展到JSON数据的方法，根据JSON路径为类型进行标记。与关系数据中的列类似，JSON路径是一种查询语言，通过指定元素的位置和内容，实现对复杂JSON数据结构的导航。我们使用图神经网络理解JSON文档集合中的结构信息。",
