    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了由Transsion语音理解处理团队（TSUP）开发的语音识别系统，用于ASRU 2023 MADASR挑战赛。该系统专注于适应低资源的印度语言，并涵盖挑战的四个跟踪。在跟踪1和2中，声学模型采用了squeezeformer编码器和双向变换器解码器，采用联合CTC-Attention训练损失。此外，在TLG波束搜索解码期间使用了外部的KenLM语言模型。在跟踪3和4中，使用了预训练的IndicWhisper模型，并在挑战数据集和公开可用的数据集上进行了微调。其whisper波束搜索解码也被修改以支持外部的KenLM语言模型，以更好地利用挑战所提供的附加文本。所提出的方法在四个跟踪中对孟加拉语的词错误率（WER）分别为24.17％、24.43％、15.97％和15.97％，对印地语的WER分别为19.61％、19.54％、15.48％",
