In this work, we introduce MANNeR, a modular framework for flexible multi-aspect (neural) news recommendation that supports ad-hoc customization over individual aspects at inference time. With metric-based learning at its core, MANNeR obtains aspect-specialized news encoders and then flexibly combines aspect-specific similarity scores for final ranking.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，神经网络新闻推荐器（NNR）通过（1）将候选新闻与用户历史之间的主题或情感等方面进行对齐，或者（2）在这些方面上推广推荐来扩展基于内容的推荐。这种定制是通过将额外的约束“硬编码”到NNR的架构和/或训练目标中来实现的：因此，任何对期望的推荐行为的更改都需要修改目标重新训练模型，从而阻碍了多方面新闻推荐的广泛应用。在这项工作中，我们引入了MANNeR，这是一个灵活的多方面（神经）新闻推荐的模块化框架，支持在推理时对各个方面进行临时定制。以度量学习为核心，MANNeR获得了专门针对各个方面的新闻编码器，然后灵活地将各个方面的相似度得分组合起来进行最终排序。在两个标准的新闻推荐基准测试上（一个是英文，一个是挪威文），MANNeR的评估结果表明...",
