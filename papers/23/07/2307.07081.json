The proposed kernelized version of the t-SNE algorithm can offer new views on the relationships between data points, which can improve performance and accuracy in particular applications, such as classification problems involving kernel methods. The differences between t-SNE and its kernelized version are illustrated for several datasets, showing a neater clustering of points belonging to different classes.",
