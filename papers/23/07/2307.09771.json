    "translated_abstract": "量子计算以其在高维度通过叠加和纠缠进行极并行计算的能力，为机器学习提供了一种有前景的方法。尽管有潜力，但现有的量子学习算法，如变分量子电路（VQC），在处理更复杂的数据集，特别是那些不可线性分离的数据集时面临挑战。此外，它还遇到了可部署性问题，使得将学习模型部署到实际的量子设备后，其准确率大幅下降。为了克服这些限制，本文提出了一种新颖的时空设计，即ST-VQC，以将非线性整合到量子学习中，并提高学习模型对噪声的鲁棒性。具体而言，ST-VQC可以通过一种新型的基于块的编码量子子电路和逐层计算的量子子电路来提取空间特征，从而实现基于时间的深度学习。此外，还提出了一种无SWAP物理电路。",
