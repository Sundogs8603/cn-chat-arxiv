    "abstract": "Despite its broad practical applications such as in fraud prevention, open-set speaker identification (OSI) has received less attention in the speaker recognition community compared to speaker verification (SV). OSI deals with determining if a test speech sample belongs to a speaker from a set of pre-enrolled individuals (in-set) or if it is from an out-of-set speaker. In addition to the typical challenges associated with speech variability, OSI is prone to the \"false-alarm problem\"; as the size of the in-set speaker population (a.k.a watchlist) grows, the out-of-set scores become larger, leading to increased false alarm rates. This is in particular challenging for applications in financial institutions and border security where the watchlist size is typically of the order of several thousand speakers. Therefore, it is important to systematically quantify the false-alarm problem, and develop techniques that alleviate the impact of watchlist size on detection performance. Prior studies ",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管开放式演讲者识别（OSI）在欺诈预防等广泛实际应用中具有广泛的应用，但与演讲者验证（SV）相比，演讲者识别社区对其关注较少。 OSI涉及确定测试语音样本是否属于一组预先注册的个体（内部集）的演讲者，或者是否来自一个外部集演讲者。除了与语音变异相关的典型挑战外，OSI还容易出现“误报问题”；随着内部集演讲者人口（也称为观察名单）的增加，外部集分数变大，导致误报率增加。这对金融机构和边境安全等应用尤为具有挑战性，其中观察名单的大小通常为几千个演讲者。因此，系统地量化误报问题并开发减轻观察名单大小对检测性能影响的技术是重要的。以前的研究",
