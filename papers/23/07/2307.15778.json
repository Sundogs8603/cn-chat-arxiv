    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了将信息几何应用于描述Ising模型的基态的方法。通过利用托里克和球面拓扑上的循环和准循环码的奇偶检验矩阵来实现。该方法建立了机器学习和纠错编码之间的联系，特别是在自同构和准循环码循环矩阵的尺寸方面。这种方法对基于捕获集的嵌入方法的发展具有影响。利用统计物理学和数字几何学来优化纠错码，从而导致这些嵌入和稀疏因子化方法的出现。本文通过演示长距离领域的最新DNN架构（ChordMixer，Mega，Mega-chunk，CDIL，...）与特定类型（Cage-graph，Repeat Accumulate）的区块和卷积LDPC码等价的方式，建立了DNN架构和纠错编码之间的直接联系。",
