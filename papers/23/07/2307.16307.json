    "translated_abstract": "许多决策场景，如公共政策，医疗保健，商业和灾难响应，需要顾及多个利益相关者的偏好。在利益相关者用定性偏好语言（如CP-net，CI-net，TCP-net，CP-Theory）表达其偏好的情况下，我们提供了第一个关于用多利益相关者的定性偏好进行推理的形式化方法。我们引入了一种查询语言，用于对满足指定条件的结果集进行查询，例如$\\mlangpref{\\psi_1}{\\psi_2}{A}$（读作由利益相关者组合$A$优选于满足$\\psi_2$的结果所组成的满足$\\psi_1$的结果集）。受实际应用场景的启发，我们引入并分析了几种查询的替代语义，并研究了它们之间的相互关系。我们提供了一个经过验证正确的算法，使用模型检验来回答多利益相关者的定性偏好查询。",
