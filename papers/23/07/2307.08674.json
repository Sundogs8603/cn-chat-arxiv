    "translated_abstract": "表格在现实世界的数据库中非常普遍，需要人们花费大量时间和精力进行分析和操作。大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步使得使用自然语言输入与表格交互成为可能，使得这种能力更加接近现实。本文介绍了TableGPT，这是一个统一的精调框架，使得LLMs能够利用外部功能命令理解和操作表格。它引入了与表格无缝交互的能力，实现了广泛的功能，如问答、数据操作（例如插入、删除、查询和修改操作）、数据可视化、分析报告生成和自动预测。TableGPT旨在通过使用户能够轻松利用表格数据来提供便利和可访问性。TableGPT的核心是全局表格表示的新概念，它使LLMs能够全面理解表格的结构和内容，并将自然语言和命令操作对表格实现无缝集成。",
