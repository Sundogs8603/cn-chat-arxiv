    "abstract": "Students who take an online course, such as a MOOC, use the course's discussion forum to ask questions or reach out to instructors when encountering an issue.

To help address this problem, we build predictive models that automatically determine the urgency of each forum post, so that these posts can be brought to instructors' attention. This paper goes beyond previous work by predicting not just a binary decision cut-off but a post's level of urgency on a 7-point scale. First, we train and cross-validate several models on an original data set of 3,503 posts from MOOCs at University of Pennsylvania.

    "translated_abstract": "参与在线课程（如MOOC）的学生会使用课程的讨论论坛，在遇到问题时向教师提问或寻求帮助。然而，由于需要考虑每条消息的时间，阅读和回复学生的问题难以扩展。结果，一些关键问题可能得不到解决，学生可能失去继续学习的动力。为了解决这个问题，我们建立了能够自动确定每个论坛帖子紧急性的预测模型，以便可以将这些帖子带给教师的注意。本文通过预测不仅二进制决策切割点，而且还预测了帖子在7分制紧急程度上的级别，从而超越了先前的工作。首先，我们在宾夕法尼亚大学的MOOCs的3503条原始数据集上训练和交叉验证了多个模型。其次，为了确定我们模型的通用性，我们在一个29,604条帖子的先前发表的数据集上测试了它们的性能。",
    "tldr": "本研究旨在解决学生在线课程讨论论坛问题的规模扩展难题。通过构建预测模型，自动确定论坛帖子的紧急程度，并提供给教师注意。与之前的工作不同，本研究通过预测7分制紧急程度级别，实现了更细粒度的预测。通过在大规模数据集上的训练和测试，证明了模型的通用性。"
