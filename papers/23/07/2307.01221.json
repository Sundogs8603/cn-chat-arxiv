    "abstract": "A filter bubble refers to the phenomenon where Internet customization effectively isolates individuals from diverse opinions or materials, resulting in their exposure to only a select set of content. This can lead to the reinforcement of existing attitudes, beliefs, or conditions. In this study, our primary focus is to investigate the impact of filter bubbles in recommender systems. This pioneering research aims to uncover the reasons behind this problem, explore potential solutions, and propose an integrated tool to help users avoid filter bubbles in recommender systems. To achieve this objective, we conduct a systematic literature review on the topic of filter bubbles in recommender systems. The reviewed articles are carefully analyzed and classified, providing valuable insights that inform the development of an integrated approach. Notably, our review reveals evidence of filter bubbles in recommendation systems, highlighting several biases that contribute to their existence. Moreove",

    "translated_abstract": "筛选泡沫是指互联网定制化使个体与多样的观点或材料有效隔离，导致他们只受到一组特定内容的影响。这可能导致现有态度、信念或条件的强化。在这项研究中，我们主要关注筛选泡沫在推荐系统中的影响。这项开创性的研究旨在揭示这个问题背后的原因，探索潜在的解决方案，并提出一个集成工具，帮助用户避免在推荐系统中的筛选泡沫。为了达到这个目标，我们对推荐系统中的筛选泡沫进行了系统的文献综述。对所综述的文章进行了仔细分析和分类，提供了对集成方法发展有价值的见解。值得注意的是，我们的综述揭示了推荐系统中筛选泡沫的证据，强调了几个导致其存在的偏见。",
