    "abstract": "With rapid development and deployment of generative language models in global settings, there is an urgent need to also scale our measurements of harm, not just in the number and types of harms covered, but also how well they account for local cultural contexts, including marginalized identities and the social biases experienced by them. Current evaluation paradigms are limited in their abilities to address this, as they are not representative of diverse, locally situated but global, socio-cultural perspectives. It is imperative that our evaluation resources are enhanced and calibrated by including people and experiences from different cultures and societies worldwide, in order to prevent gross underestimations or skews in measurements of harm. In this work, we demonstrate a socio-culturally aware expansion of evaluation resources in the Indian societal context, specifically for the harm of stereotyping. We devise a community engaged effort to build a resource which contains stereotype",

    "translated_abstract": "随着生成语言模型在全球范围内的迅速发展和部署，我们迫切需要在测量伤害方面进行扩展，不仅包括覆盖的伤害数量和类型，还要考虑到当地文化背景，包括边缘化身份和他们所经历的社会偏见。当前的评估范式在解决这个问题上存在局限性，因为它们不代表多元化、本地化但全球化的社会文化视角。为了避免对伤害测量产生严重低估或扭曲，我们迫切需要通过包含来自不同文化和社会的人们和经验来增强和校准我们的评估资源。在这项工作中，我们在印度社会背景下展示了对刻板印象伤害实施社会文化意识的评估资源的扩展。我们设计了一个社区参与的努力来构建一个包含刻板印象的资源。",
