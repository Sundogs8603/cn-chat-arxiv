    "translated_abstract": "从每个类别示例分布不均匀的训练数据进行机器学习可能会导致模型在常见类别上性能优秀，但对于稀有类别的性能不佳。AudioSet拥有527个声音事件类别，其先验分布范围非常广泛。通常通过对每个类别指标的简单平均来评估AudioSet的分类性能，这意味着稀有类别的性能与常见类别的性能同等重要。一些最近的论文利用数据集平衡技术来提高在AudioSet上的性能。然而，我们发现，尽管平衡在公开的AudioSet评估数据上改善了性能，但同时也损害了在相同条件下收集的未发布评估集的性能。通过调整平衡程度，我们证明了其好处是脆弱的，并且取决于评估集。我们也没有找到显示平衡相对于常见类别会改善稀有类别性能的证据。",
