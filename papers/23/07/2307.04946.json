    "translated_abstract": "逆问题一般需要一个正则化器或先验来得到一个良好的解决方案。最近一种趋势是通过训练卷积网络去降噪图像，并在求解逆问题时将这个网络作为先验。一些方法依赖于正向算子的奇异值分解，而其他一些在运行时通过去噪网络进行反向传播。我们在这里提出了一种更简单的方法，将传统的基于梯度的最小化重构误差与去噪相结合。每一步都添加噪声，使得迭代动力学类似于Langevin或扩散过程。添加的噪声水平和去噪步骤的大小都会随时间指数衰减。我们将这种方法应用于从多个倾角获取的电子显微图的层析重建问题。通过使用模拟倾斜视图进行实证研究，我们找到了适用于我们方法的参数设置，得到了良好的结果。我们证明，只需50个倾斜视图就可以达到高精度。",
