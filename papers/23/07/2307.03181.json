The state transitions are Markovian and the sender seeks to maximize the long-run average reward by committing to a (possibly history-dependent) signaling mechanism. While most previous studies of Markov persuasion consider exogenous agent beliefs that are independent of the chain, we study a more natural variant with endogenous agent beliefs that depend on the chain's realized history. A key challenge to analyze such settings is to model the agents' partial knowledge about the history information. We analyze a Markov persuasion process (MPP) under various information models that differ in the amount of information the receivers have about the history of the process. Specifically, we formulate a general partial-information model where each receiver observes the history with an $\\ell$ period lag.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一种动态贝叶斯说服环境，在这种环境下，一个持久的发送者通过共享与收益相关的状态信息，说服一系列\"短命\"代理（接收者）。状态转移是马尔可夫的，发送者通过承诺一个（可能是历史依赖的）信号机制来最大化长期平均收益。虽然大多数先前的马尔可夫说服研究考虑的是与链独立的外生代理信念，但我们研究了一种更自然的变种，其中代理信念取决于链的实现历史。分析这种情况的一个关键挑战是对代理对历史信息的局部了解进行建模。我们在各种信息模型下分析了一个马尔可夫说服过程（MPP），这些信息模型在接收者对过程历史的了解程度上有所不同。具体来说，我们制定了一个通用的部分信息模型，其中每个接收者以$\\ell$期滞后观察历史信息。",
