We compare the memory usage of different ZDD variants for three well-known examples from the literature: the Muddy Children, the Sum and Product puzzle and the Dining Cryptographers. Our implementation is based on the existing model checker SMCDEL and the CUDD library. Our results show that replacing BDDs with the right variant of ZDDs can significantly reduce memory usage. This suggests that ZDDs are a useful tool for model checking multi-agent systems.",
