    "translated_abstract": "适应环境的规律对生物有重要意义，使其能够预测事件和制定计划。其中一个显著的例子是生物对地球自转24小时周期的内化，即昼夜节律。本文研究了深度强化学习智能体中类似昼夜节律的出现。具体而言，我们在一个周期性变化可靠的环境中部署了智能体，并解决了一个觅食任务。我们系统地表征了智能体在学习过程中的行为，并证明了一个内源性且可调匹的节律的出现。有趣的是，内部节律适应了环境信号相位的变化，而无需重新训练。此外，我们通过分岔和相位响应曲线分析展示了人工神经元如何发展出支持环境节律内化的动力学。从动力学系统视角看，我们证明了此自适应过程的实现方式。",
