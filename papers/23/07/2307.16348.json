    "abstract": "This paper develops a novel rating-based reinforcement learning approach that uses human ratings to obtain human guidance in reinforcement learning. Different from the existing preference-based and ranking-based reinforcement learning paradigms, based on human relative preferences over sample pairs, the proposed rating-based reinforcement learning approach is based on human evaluation of individual trajectories without relative comparisons between sample pairs. The rating-based reinforcement learning approach builds on a new prediction model for human ratings and a novel multi-class loss function. We conduct several experimental studies based on synthetic ratings and real human ratings to evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of the new rating-based reinforcement learning approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的基于评分的强化学习方法，利用人类评分来获得人类指导强化学习。与现有的基于偏好和基于排名的强化学习范式不同，该方法基于人类对样本轨迹的评估而不是对样本对的相对比较。基于评分的强化学习方法建立在一个新的人类评分预测模型和一种新颖的多类损失函数上。我们通过合成评分和真实人类评分进行了多个实验研究，评估了新的基于评分的强化学习方法的有效性和好处。",
