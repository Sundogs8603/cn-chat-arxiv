    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型能够以上下文化的方式吸纳新的信息，但由于有效上下文长度的限制，这种方法的潜力通常受到限制。解决这个问题的一种方法是为注意力层提供访问外部存储器的能力，该存储器由（键，值）对组成。然而，随着文档数量的增加，相关键与无关键的比例减少，使模型更加关注无关键。我们发现了一个名为分心问题的重要挑战，即与不同语义值相关联的键可能重叠，使它们难以区分。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了Focused Transformer（FoT），一种受对比学习启发的训练方法。这种新颖的方法增强了（键，值）空间的结构，使上下文长度得以扩展。我们的方法允许对现有大型模型进行微调，以更好地处理长上下文。",
