    "translated_abstract": "光谱描记（PPG）信号通常通过可穿戴设备获取，具有持续健康监测的重要潜力。特别是那些以罕见和微妙的心脏模式来表现的心脏疾病可能会引起关注。然而，由于标记数据的稀缺性和不同受试者之间的高变异性，这些数据中的强健可靠的异常检测仍然是一个挑战。本文提出了一个两阶段框架，利用表示学习和个性化来提高PPG数据中的异常检测性能。首先，该框架利用表示学习将原始PPG信号转换成更具区分性和紧凑性的表示。然后，我们将三种不同的无监督异常检测方法应用于运动检测和生物特征识别。我们在两个不同的数据集上验证了我们的方法，包括广义和个性化的情景。结果表明，表示学习显著提高了异常检测的性能。",
