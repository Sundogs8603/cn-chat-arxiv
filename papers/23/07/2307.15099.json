    "abstract": "The distribution of illustrations on social media, such as Twitter and Pixiv has increased with the growing popularity of animation, games, and animated movies. The \"atmosphere\" of illustrations plays an important role in user preferences. Classifying illustrations by atmosphere can be helpful for recommendations and searches. However, assigning clear labels to the elusive \"atmosphere\" and conventional supervised classification is not always practical. Furthermore, even images with similar colors, edges, and low-level features may not have similar atmospheres, making classification based on low-level features challenging. In this paper, this problem is solved using both supervised and unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels. The feature vectors are obtained using the supervised method with pseudo-labels that contribute to an ambiguous atmosphere. Further, clustering is performed based on these feature vectors. Experimental analyses show that our method outperforms conventional methods",

    "translated_abstract": "随着动画、游戏和动画电影的日益流行，社交媒体上插图的分布逐渐增加。插图的\"氛围\"在用户偏好中起着重要作用。按照氛围对插图进行分类可以为推荐和搜索提供帮助。然而，给难以定义的\"氛围\"分配明确的标签并且使用传统的监督分类并不总是可行的。此外，即使颜色、边缘和低层次特征相似的图像也可能没有相似的氛围，这使得基于低层次特征进行分类具有挑战性。本文提出了一种采用伪标签的监督和无监督学习相结合来解决这个问题的方法。使用伪标签通过监督方法获得的特征向量有助于处理模糊的氛围。然后，基于这些特征向量进行聚类。实验分析表明，我们的方法优于传统方法。",
