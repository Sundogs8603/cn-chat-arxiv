    "translated_abstract": "鉴于每年专利申请数量的迅速增长，促进专利探索和检索的信息和多媒体检索方法至关重要。不同类型的可视化（例如，图形、技术图纸）和视角（例如，侧视、透视）被用来可视化专利创新的细节。对这些图像的分类可以实现更高效的搜索并进行进一步分析。到目前为止，用于图像类型分类的数据集缺少一些重要的专利可视化类型。此外，相关研究没有使用包括transformers在内的最新深度学习方法。在本文中，我们采用最先进的深度学习方法来分类专利图像中的可视化类型和视角。我们对专利中图像类型分类的CLEF-IP数据集进行了扩展，增加到了十个类别，并提供了手动标注的真实标签。此外，我们从一个数据集中推导出一组层级类别。",
