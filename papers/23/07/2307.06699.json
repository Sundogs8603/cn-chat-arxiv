To aid researchers coming from other fields, we develop a prototype system for searching for and defining mathematical concepts in context, focusing on the field of category theory. This system, Parmesan, depends on natural language processing components including concept extraction, relation extraction, definition extraction, and entity linking. In developing this system, we show that existing techniques cannot be applied directly to the category theory domain, and suggest hybrid techniques that do perform well, though we expect the system to evolve over time.

    "translated_abstract": "数学是一个高度专业化的领域，具有自己独特的挑战，但在自然语言处理领域的研究却有限。然而，数学在许多不同领域的跨学科研究中经常依赖于对数学概念的理解。为了帮助来自其他领域的研究人员，我们开发了一个原型系统，用于在上下文中搜索和定义数学概念，重点关注范畴论领域。这个系统名为Parmesan，依赖于自然语言处理组件，包括概念提取、关系提取、定义提取和实体链接。在开发这个系统的过程中，我们展示了现有技术不能直接应用于范畴论领域，并提出了一种混合技术，这种技术表现良好，但我们预计系统将随着时间的推移而不断演变。我们还提供了两个清理过的数学语料库，用于支持原型系统，这些语料库基于期刊文章。",
