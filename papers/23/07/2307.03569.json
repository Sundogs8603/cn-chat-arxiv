    "abstract": "Reading levels are highly individual and can depend on a text's language, a person's cognitive abilities, or knowledge on a topic. Text simplification is the task of rephrasing a text to better cater to the abilities of a specific target reader group. Simplification of scientific abstracts helps non-experts to access the core information by bypassing formulations that require domain or expert knowledge. This is especially relevant for, e.g., cancer patients reading about novel treatment options. The SimpleText lab hosts the simplification of scientific abstracts for non-experts (Task 3) to advance this field. We contribute three runs employing out-of-the-box summarization models (two based on T5, one based on PEGASUS) and one run using ChatGPT with complex phrase identification.",

    "translated_abstract": "阅读水平因语言、个人认知能力或对某一主题的了解而有很大差异。文本简化是将文本重新表述以更好地适应特定目标读者群体能力的任务。科学摘要的简化有助于非专业人士通过跳过需要领域或专家知识的表述来获取核心信息，尤其对于读者阅读关于新型治疗选择的癌症患者来说尤为重要。SimpleText实验室主办了针对非专业人士的科学摘要简化比赛（Task 3）以推动该领域的发展。我们贡献了三个运行实例，分别基于T5的两个和基于PEGASUS的一个的出箱摘要模型，并利用ChatGPT进行复杂短语识别的一个运行实例。",
