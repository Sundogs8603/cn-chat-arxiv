    "abstract": "Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) have been widely used to model user behavior over time, but their robustness in the face of perturbations to training data is a critical issue. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to investigate the effects of removing items at different positions within a temporally ordered sequence. We evaluate two different SRS models on multiple datasets, measuring their performance using Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) and Rank Sensitivity List metrics. Our results demonstrate that removing items at the end of the sequence significantly impacts performance, with NDCG decreasing up to 60\\%, while removing items from the beginning or middle has no significant effect. These findings highlight the importance of considering the position of the perturbed items in the training data and shall inform the design of more robust SRSs.",

    "translated_abstract": "顺序推荐系统被广泛用于建模用户随时间变化的行为，然而其在面对训练数据扰动时的鲁棒性是一个关键问题。本文进行了一项经验研究，探究了在时间顺序序列中不同位置上删除项目的效果。我们评估了两种不同的顺序推荐系统模型在多个数据集上的表现，使用归一化折现累积增益（NDCG）指标和排名敏感度列表（Rank Sensitivity List）指标来衡量其性能。我们的结果显示，删除序列末尾的项目显著影响性能，NDCG下降高达60％，而删除序列开头或中间的项目没有显著影响。这些发现凸显了考虑训练数据中扰动项目位置的重要性，并可指导更具鲁棒性的顺序推荐系统的设计。",
