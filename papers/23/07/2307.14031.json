    "abstract": "Creating high-quality annotated data for task-oriented dialog (ToD) is known to be notoriously difficult, and the challenges are amplified when the goal is to create equitable, culturally adapted, and large-scale ToD datasets for multiple languages. Therefore, the current datasets are still very scarce and suffer from limitations such as translation-based non-native dialogs with translation artefacts, small scale, or lack of cultural adaptation, among others. In this work, we first take stock of the current landscape of multilingual ToD datasets, offering a systematic overview of their properties and limitations. Aiming to reduce all the detected limitations, we then introduce Multi3WOZ, a novel multilingual, multi-domain, multi-parallel ToD dataset. It is large-scale and offers culturally adapted dialogs in 4 languages to enable training and evaluation of multilingual and cross-lingual ToD systems. We describe a complex bottom-up data collection process that yielded the final dataset,",

    "translated_abstract": "任务导向对话（ToD）的高质量标注数据的创建被公认为极其困难，而当目标是为多种语言创建公平、文化适应和大规模的ToD数据集时，挑战更加严峻。因此，当前的数据集仍然非常稀缺，并且存在诸如基于翻译的非母语对话与翻译效果不佳、规模小或缺乏文化适应等限制。在这项工作中，我们首先梳理了当前多语言ToD数据集的现状，系统地概述了它们的特点和限制。为了减少所有检测到的限制，我们引入了Multi3WOZ，这是一个新颖的多语言、多领域、多对话平行ToD数据集。它是大规模的，并提供了以四种语言进行文化适应的对话，以便训练和评估多语言和跨语言的ToD系统。我们描述了一个复杂的自下而上的数据收集过程，得到了最终的数据集。",
