    "translated_abstract": "自2022年底以来，大型语言模型（LLMs）已成为非常突出的研究领域，像ChatGPT和Bard这样的LLMs已经吸引了数百万个用户。每周都有数百个新的LLMs被发布，其中许多被上传到Hugging Face，这是一个机器学习模型和数据集的库。到目前为止，该网站已经上传了近16000个文本生成模型。鉴于LLMs的大量涌入，了解哪些LLM骨干、设置、训练方法和族群受到欢迎或趋势变得很有意义。然而，目前没有一个全面的LLMs索引可用。我们利用Hugging Face LLMs的相对系统的命名法对LLMs进行层次聚类，并使用n-gram和词频-逆文档频率来识别LLMs之间的联系和群体。我们的方法成功地识别了LLMs的族群，并将LLMs准确地聚类成有意义的子组。我们展示了一个公共的网页应用程序来浏览和探索Constellation，我们的15821个LLMs的图谱。",
