    "abstract": "This paper presents a series of approaches aimed at enhancing the performance of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) by utilizing extracted semantic information from a Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) model. We propose a novel end-to-end Semantic Role Labeling model that effectively captures most of the structured semantic information within the Transformer hidden state. We believe that this end-to-end model is well-suited for our newly proposed models that incorporate semantic information. We evaluate the proposed models in two languages, English and Czech, employing ELECTRA-small models. Our combined models improve ABSA performance in both languages. Moreover, we achieved new state-of-the-art results on the Czech ABSA.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一系列的方法，旨在通过利用从语义角色标注（SRL）模型中提取的语义信息来提高基于方面的情感分析（ABSA）的性能。我们提出了一种新颖的端到端语义角色标注模型，能够有效捕获Transformer隐藏状态中的大部分结构化语义信息。我们相信这种端到端模型非常适合我们新提出的融合语义信息的模型。我们使用ELECTRA-small模型在英语和捷克语两种语言上评估了提出的模型。我们的组合模型在两种语言的ABSA性能上都有所提升。此外，我们在捷克语ABSA上取得了新的最佳结果。",
