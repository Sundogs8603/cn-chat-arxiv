    "abstract": "We propose an unsupervised deep learning-based decoding scheme that enables one-shot decoding of polar codes. In the proposed scheme, rather than using the information bit vectors as labels for training the neural network (NN) through supervised learning as the conventional scheme did, the NN is trained to function as a bounded distance decoder by leveraging the generator matrix of polar codes through self-supervised learning. This approach eliminates the reliance on predefined labels, empowering the potential to train directly on the actual data within communication systems and thereby enhancing the applicability. Furthermore, computer simulations demonstrate that (i) the bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) performances of the proposed scheme can approach those of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder for very short packets and (ii) the proposed NN decoder exhibits much superior generalization ability compared to the conventional one.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种无监督深度学习的解码方案，可以实现极化码的单次解码。在这种方案中，我们不再使用信息位向量作为标签来训练神经网络（NN），而是通过自监督学习利用极化码的生成矩阵来训练NN以实现有界距离解码。这种方法消除了对预定义标签的依赖，增强了直接在通信系统的实际数据上进行训练的可能性，从而提高了可应用性。此外，计算机模拟表明，（i）所提出的方案的误比特率（BER）和块错误率（BLER）性能在非常短的数据包上可以接近最大后验概率（MAP）解码器的性能，（ii）与传统的解码器相比，所提出的NN解码器展示了更优越的泛化能力。",
