    "translated_abstract": "磁共振成像（MRI）是一种提供无辐射、丰富和多样化有关整个人体医学诊断信息的主要放射学方法，但其扫描时间较长。通过k空间欠采样可以显著减少扫描时间，但需要在图像重建中去除引入的伪影。虽然深度学习（DL）已经成为快速MRI图像重建的有力工具，但其在多种成像场景中的潜力尚未充分利用。这是因为不仅收集大规模和多样化的真实训练数据通常昂贵且受限于隐私，现有的DL方法还难以处理训练数据和目标数据之间实际上不可避免的不匹配。在这里，我们提出了一种物理信息合成数据学习框架（PISF）用于快速MRI，它是第一个仅使用一个训练模型实现可推广的多场景MRI重建的方法。",
