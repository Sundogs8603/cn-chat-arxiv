    "translated_abstract": "使用显微图像诊断罕见的贫血疾病对于熟练的专家和机器学习方法来说都具有挑战性。由于在单个血样中有数千个与疾病相关的细胞，这构成了一个复杂的多实例学习（MIL）问题。虽然红细胞的空间邻域本身并不重要，但整个血样的拓扑结构，即数据的几何性质，包含了有益的特征，以解决典型的MIL问题，如梯度消失和在有限数据上训练时的过拟合。因此，我们开发了一种基于拓扑的方法，从单个红细胞图像的包中提取多尺度的拓扑特征。这些拓扑特征被用来对模型进行正则化，强制保持数据的特征拓扑属性。在包含71个罕见贫血疾病患者的数据集上，包括521张红细胞显微图像，我们的实验表明拓扑正则化是一个有效的方法。",

By extracting multi-scale topological features from individual red blood cell images and using them to regularize the model, the method preserves the topological properties of the data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach."
