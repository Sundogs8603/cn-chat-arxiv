    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种通过受限玻尔兹曼机（RBMs）实现的二值图像去噪框架，该框架引入了一个二次无约束二值优化（QUBO）形式的去噪目标，并且非常适合量子退火。通过在训练的RBMs上学习到的分布与噪声图像偏离的惩罚项的平衡，实现了去噪目标。我们推导了在目标分布被良好近似的情况下，惩罚参数的统计最优选择，并进一步建议了一种经过经验证支持的修改方法，使该方法对于理想化假设具有鲁棒性。我们还在额外的假设下展示了，我们方法得到的去噪图像在期望意义下明显比噪声图像更接近无噪声图像。虽然我们将该模型构建为图像去噪模型，但它可以应用于任何二值数据。由于QUBO公式非常适合在量子退火器上实现，我们在一个数据集上对该模型进行了测试。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a framework for binary image denoising using restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) in the form of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), which is suitable for quantum annealing. The framework achieves the denoising objective by balancing the learned distribution and the penalty term for deviations from the noisy image. Experimental results show that the method produces denoised images that are statistically closer to the noise-free images than the noisy images are."
