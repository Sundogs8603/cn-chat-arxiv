    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一类双人零和图游戏，称为竞价游戏。游戏的进行如下：两位玩家拥有有限的预算，在图的一个顶点上放置一个令牌，每轮玩家同时提交竞价，出价较高者移动令牌，如果出价相同，则有利于玩家1。只有当令牌访问到指定的目标顶点时，玩家1才能赢得游戏。我们首次考虑了“贫民离散竞价”，其中竞价的粒度受限制，较高的出价支付给银行。先前的研究要么没有施加粒度限制，要么考虑了“富翁”竞价（出价支付给对手）。虽然后一种机制在技术上更易于理解，但前者在实践角度更具吸引力。我们的研究着眼于“阈值预算”，即玩家1为确保对抗给定玩家2的预算而必需的初始预算的必要性和充分性。我们首先证明了存在性。",
