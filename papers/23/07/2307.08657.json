    "translated_abstract": "最近神经图像压缩（NIC）的进展已经产生了一些开始超越经典编解码器的模型。尽管这引起了越来越多关于在实际应用中使用NIC的兴奋，但任何机器学习系统在实际环境中的成功应用都要求它在部署时具有泛化性能（和鲁棒性）。不幸的是，目前的研究缺乏全面的数据集和信息工具来评估和理解NIC在实际环境中的性能。为了弥补这个关键的差距，首先，本文提出了一个全面的基准套件来评估图像压缩方法在分布上未见情况下的性能。具体而言，我们通过向流行的CLIC和Kodak基准测试中引入15个损坏类型，提供了CLIC-C和Kodak-C两个新增数据集。接下来，我们提出了一种光谱启发式的检测工具，以深入了解图像压缩方法引入的错误以及它们在未见分布下的性能。然后，我们进行了详细的性能比较研究。",
