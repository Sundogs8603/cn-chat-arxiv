    "translated_abstract": "数据可视化已经成为市场上流行的工具，因为它能有效地展示大量的数据见解。为了降低使用数据可视化的门槛，研究界已经开始研究自动数据可视化任务，如自然语言问题到可视化转换（正式称为文本到可视化）。然而，文本到可视化假设自然语言问题已经有一个良好的组织并且用一个句子来表达。然而，在现实世界中，复杂的数据可视化需要通过可视化系统和用户之间的连续交互来完成。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的任务，称为CoVis，即对话式文本到可视化，旨在通过用户和系统之间的多个交互来构建数据可视化。因为这个任务在文献中还没有被研究，所以我们首先建立了一个名为Dial-NVBench的基准数据集，包括用户的一系列查询和系统的回应的对话会话。然后，我们提出了一个多重的方法",
