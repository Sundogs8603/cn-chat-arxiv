    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models have led to renewed interest in natural language processing in healthcare using the free text of clinical notes. One distinguishing characteristic of clinical notes is their long time span over multiple long documents. The unique structure of clinical notes creates a new design choice: when the context length for a language model predictor is limited, which part of clinical notes should we choose as the input? Existing studies either choose the inputs with domain knowledge or simply truncate them. We propose a framework to analyze the sections with high predictive power. Using MIMIC-III, we show that: 1) predictive power distribution is different between nursing notes and discharge notes and 2) combining different types of notes could improve performance when the context length is large. Our findings suggest that a carefully selected sampling function could enable more efficient information extraction from clinical notes.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近大规模语言模型的进展使得使用临床记录的自由文本进行自然语言处理的兴趣重新燃起。临床记录的一个区别特点是它们跨越多个长文档的长时间跨度。临床记录的独特结构带来了一个新的设计选择：当语言模型预测器的上下文长度有限时，应选择临床记录的哪个部分作为输入？现有研究要么选择具有领域知识的输入，要么简单地截断它们。我们提出了一个分析高预测能力部分的框架。使用MIMIC-III数据集，我们展示了以下发现：1）预测能力分布在护理记录和出院记录之间是不同的；2）当上下文长度较大时，组合不同类型的记录可以提高性能。我们的研究结果表明，精心选择的采样函数可以使从临床记录中提取信息更加高效。",
