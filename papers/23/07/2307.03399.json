    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统被认为是管理信息过载的有效工具。然而，传统算法在这类系统中的应用主要强调精确的推荐，因此忽视了覆盖率、多样性和物品的新颖性等其他重要方面。这种方法导致长尾物品的曝光率较低。本文提出了一种名为PIM+RA的方法，旨在个性化推荐并更有目的地分配推荐资源。该方法利用包含自连接边和权重的二分网络，并采用改进的Pearson相关系数进行更好的重新分配。PIM+RA的评估不仅在准确性方面显示了显著的改进，而且在推荐的覆盖范围、多样性和新颖性方面也有显著的增强。它通过为长尾物品提供有效曝光的同时，允许自定义参数，实现了更好的推荐频率平衡。",
