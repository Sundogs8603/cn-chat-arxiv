    "translated_abstract": "坐标降噪是一种有前途的3D分子预训练方法，在各种下游药物发现任务中取得了显著的性能。从理论上讲，其目标等同于学习力场，并且对下游任务有帮助。然而，坐标降噪学习有效力场面临两个挑战，即样本覆盖率低和各向同性力场。根本原因在于现有降噪方法所假设的分子分布不能捕捉分子的各向异性特征。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新的混合噪声策略，包括二面角和坐标的噪声。然而，以传统方式降噪这种混合噪声不再等同于学习力场。通过理论推导，我们发现问题是由于输入构象对协方差的依赖性所导致的。因此，我们提出将这两种类型的噪声解耦",

The challenges of low coverage samples and isotropic force field are addressed by a hybrid noise strategy, and the problem of being unable to learn the force field with traditional denoising methods is overcome by decoupling the two types of noise."
