    "abstract": "We investigate explainability via short Boolean formulas in the data model based on unary relations. As an explanation of length k, we take a Boolean formula of length k that minimizes the error with respect to the target attribute to be explained. We first provide novel quantitative bounds for the expected error in this scenario. We then also demonstrate how the setting works in practice by studying three concrete data sets. In each case, we calculate explanation formulas of different lengths using an encoding in Answer Set Programming. The most accurate formulas we obtain achieve errors similar to other methods on the same data sets. However, due to overfitting, these formulas are not necessarily ideal explanations, so we use cross validation to identify a suitable length for explanations. By limiting to shorter formulas, we obtain explanations that avoid overfitting but are still reasonably accurate and also, importantly, human interpretable.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了基于一元关系的数据模型中通过短布尔公式进行解释的可行性。作为长度为k的解释，我们采用一个长度为k的布尔公式，该公式在解释目标属性方面的错误最小化。我们首先为这种情况提供了新颖的期望错误的定量界限。然后，我们通过研究三个具体的数据集来演示该设置在实践中的运作方式。在每种情况下，我们使用Answer Set Programming中的编码计算不同长度的解释公式。我们得到的最准确的公式在相同的数据集上实现了与其他方法类似的错误。然而，由于过拟合的原因，这些公式不一定是理想的解释，因此我们使用交叉验证来确定合适的解释长度。通过限制为更短的公式，我们得到的解释不仅避免了过拟合，而且依然相当准确，并且重要的是，易于人类解释。",
