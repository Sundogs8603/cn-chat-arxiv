    "translated_abstract": "选择性推断（SI）作为一种适用于数据驱动的假设检验的有前景的框架，一直受到研究关注。SI的基本思想是在一个假设被选中的事件的条件下进行推断。为了进行SI，必须以可追踪的形式对这个事件进行描述。当选择事件难以描述时，可以引入额外的条件以使其可处理。这些额外的条件往往会导致功效的损失，这一问题被称为过度条件化。基于参数规划的SI（PP-based SI）被提出作为解决过度条件化问题的一种方法。PP-based SI的主要问题是由于需要完全地探索数据空间而导致计算成本高。本研究引入了一种降低计算成本的过程，同时保证所需精度，通过提出计算p值的上界和下界的方法。我们还提出了三种类型的搜索策略。",
