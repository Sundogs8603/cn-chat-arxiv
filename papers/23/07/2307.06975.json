    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 involves the integration of digital technologies, such as IoT, Big Data, and AI, into manufacturing and industrial processes to increase efficiency and productivity. As these technologies become more interconnected and interdependent, Industry 4.0 systems become more complex, which brings the difficulty of identifying and stopping anomalies that may cause disturbances in the manufacturing process. This paper aims to propose a diffusion-based model for real-time anomaly prediction in Industry 4.0 processes. Using a neuro-symbolic approach, we integrate industrial ontologies in the model, thereby adding formal knowledge on smart manufacturing. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective way of distilling diffusion models through Random Fourier Features for deployment on an embedded system for direct integration into the manufacturing process. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has never been explored before.",

    "translated_abstract": "工业4.0将物联网、大数据和人工智能等数字技术整合到制造和工业流程中，以提高效率和生产力。随着这些技术的互联互通和相互依赖程度越来越高，工业4.0系统变得更加复杂，这就带来了识别和停止可能在制造过程中引起干扰的异常的困难。本文旨在提出一种基于扩散的模型，用于工业4.0流程中的实时异常预测。通过神经符号方法，我们将工业本体论集成到模型中，从而在智能制造中添加了形式化知识。最后，我们提出了一种简单而有效的通过随机傅里叶特征提取扩散模型的方法，以便将其部署到嵌入式系统中，直接集成到制造过程中。据我们所知，这种方法在以前从未被探索过。",
