We introduce the wage decomposition method to quantify the effects of TNC trips on taxi drivers' work hours over time, based on taxi and TNC trip record data from 2013 to 2018 in New York City. The data are analyzed to evaluate the changes in overall market performances and taxi drivers' work behavior through statistical analyses, and our results show that the increase in TNC trips not only decreases the income level of taxi drivers but also discourages their willingness to work.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管交通网络公司（TNCs）的增长大幅减少了传统出租车行业的客流和资产价值，但现有的出租车市场政策法规和规划模型仍需要重新审视，这需要对出租车行业劳动供应和收入水平的敏感性进行可靠估计。本研究旨在调查交通网络公司对出租车行业劳动供应的影响，估计工资弹性，并了解出租车司机工作偏好的变化。我们引入工资分解方法，根据纽约市2013年至2018年的出租车和TNC旅行记录数据，量化TNC旅行对出租车司机工作时间的影响。通过统计分析对数据进行分析，以评估整体市场表现和出租车司机工作行为的变化，我们的研究结果表明，TNC旅行的增加不仅降低了出租车司机的收入水平，还削弱了他们工作的意愿。",
