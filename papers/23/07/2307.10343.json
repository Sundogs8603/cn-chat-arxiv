    "translated_abstract": "原核基因预测在理解生物和其功能方面具有重要作用，在医学和生物技术中有应用。尽管当前的基因预测方法在寻找长基因方面非常敏感，但在寻找短基因(<180 nts)方面，它们的敏感性明显降低。原因是缺乏注释的基因数据以识别短开放阅读框(ORFs)中的区别特征。我们开发了一种基于深度学习的方法，称为ProtiGeno，专门针对短原核基因，该方法使用在数百万个进化蛋白质上训练的蛋白质语言模型。在对4,288个原核基因组进行系统大规模实验中，我们证明ProtiGeno相较于当前最先进的基因预测方法，在预测短编码和非编码基因方面具有更高的准确性和召回率。通过可视化预测的短基因的三维结构，我们讨论了ProtiGeno的预测特征和可能的局限性。",
