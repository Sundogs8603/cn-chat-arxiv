    "translated_abstract": "在使用云服务进行私有领域营销时，商家通常需要为多个营销目的购买不同的机器学习模型，导致成本非常高。我们提出了一个统一的用户-物品匹配框架，可以通过一个模型同时进行物品推荐和用户定位。我们通过对用户-物品交互矩阵进行多项分布建模的实验验证了上述并发建模的可行性，并提出了一个双向偏差校正的NCE loss来实现。提出的损失函数通过纠正由于批次内负采样引起的用户和物品偏差，引导模型学习用户-物品联合概率p(u,i)，而不是条件概率p(i|u)或p(u|i)。此外，我们的框架对模型架构具有灵活的适应性。广泛的实验证明，我们的框架可以显著提高性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "UniMatch is a unified user-item matching framework that reduces the cost of purchasing multiple machine learning models for different marketing purposes by using a single model for both item recommendation and user targeting. It employs multinomial distribution modeling for the user-item interaction matrix and utilizes a bidirectional bias-corrected loss function to guide the model in learning the joint probability of user-item interactions, resulting in improved performance."
