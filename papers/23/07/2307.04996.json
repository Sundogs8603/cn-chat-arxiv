    "translated_abstract": "个性化推荐在直接营销中越来越重要，激发了通过知识图谱（KG）应用来提升客户体验的研究动机。例如，在金融服务领域，公司可以通过向客户提供相关金融文章来培养关系，促进客户参与和促进知情的金融决策。尽管一些方法专注于基于KG的推荐系统以改进内容，但在本研究中，我们专注于可解释的基于KG的推荐系统来进行决策。为此，我们提出了两种基于知识图谱的个性化文章推荐方法，用于一家大型跨国金融服务公司的一组客户。第一种方法使用强化学习，第二种方法使用XGBoost算法来向客户推荐文章。这两种方法都利用从结构化（表格数据）和非结构化数据（大量文本数据）生成的KG。",
