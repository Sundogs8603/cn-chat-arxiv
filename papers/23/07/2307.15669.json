    "translated_abstract": "空气污染在全世界范围内产生了巨大的健康损害和经济成本。污染暴露的程度在国家间和国内差异很大。然而，全球范围内空气质量不平等及其随时间变化的程度尚未得到量化。本研究使用经济不平等指数来衡量各国暴露于直径为2.5微米或以下的环境细颗粒物（PM2.5）的不平等情况。研究发现全球空气质量不平等水平高且持续上升。全球PM2.5基尼系数从2000年的0.32上升到2020年的0.36，超过了许多国家的收入不平等水平。空气质量不平等主要是由国家间差异引起的，而国内差异的影响较小，分解分析结果显示。面对最高水平PM2.5暴露的人口大部分集中在只有少数几个国家。研究结果表明，仅关注国内差异的研究和政策努力忽视了一个重要问题。",
