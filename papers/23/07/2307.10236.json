    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的最近性能突破为众多工业应用和领域提供了新的机遇。然而，LLMs的错误生成，如虚假预测、错误信息和幻觉，也引发了对LLMs可靠性的严重关注，尤其在对安全、可靠性有敏感的场景中，可能阻碍其在实际中的应用。尽管不确定性估计已经显示出其在解释一般机器学习（ML）模型的预测风险方面的潜力，但关于它是否以及在多大程度上有助于探索LLMs的能力和抵制其不良行为方面知之甚少。为了弥合这一差距，本文从不确定性的角度开展了关于LLMs风险评估的探索性研究。具体来说，我们使用12种不确定性估计方法和4个LLMs在4个重要的自然语言处理（NLP）任务上进行实验，以调查不确定性在探索LLMs能力和对抗其不良行为方面的程度。",
