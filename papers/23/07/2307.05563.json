    "abstract": "Contactless fingerprint matching using smartphone cameras can alleviate major challenges of traditional fingerprint systems including hygienic acquisition, portability and presentation attacks. However, development of practical and robust contactless fingerprint matching techniques is constrained by the limited availability of large scale real-world datasets. To motivate further advances in contactless fingerprint matching across sensors, we introduce the RidgeBase benchmark dataset. RidgeBase consists of more than 15,000 contactless and contact-based fingerprint image pairs acquired from 88 individuals under different background and lighting conditions using two smartphone cameras and one flatbed contact sensor. Unlike existing datasets, RidgeBase is designed to promote research under different matching scenarios that include Single Finger Matching and Multi-Finger Matching for both contactless- to-contactless (CL2CL) and contact-to-contactless (C2CL) verification and identification.

    "translated_abstract": "使用智能手机相机进行非接触指纹匹配可以解决传统指纹系统的一些主要挑战，包括卫生采集、便携性和攻击防范。然而，实际和鲁棒的非接触指纹匹配技术的发展受到了大规模真实世界数据集的限制。为了激发在不同传感器之间进一步发展非接触指纹匹配的进步，我们介绍了RidgeBase基准数据集。RidgeBase包含了来自88个个体，在不同背景和照明条件下使用两个智能手机相机和一个平板触摸传感器获得的超过15,000个非接触和接触式指纹图像对。与现有数据集不同，RidgeBase旨在促进在不同匹配场景下的研究，包括单指匹配和多指匹配，既包括非接触到非接触（CL2CL）的验证和识别，也包括接触到非接触（C2CL）的验证和识别。",
