    "abstract": "Survival analysis is an integral part of the statistical toolbox. However, while most domains of classical statistics have embraced deep learning, survival analysis only recently gained some minor attention from the deep learning community. This recent development is likely in part motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to provide the tools needed to fully harness the potential of survival analysis in deep learning. On the one hand, we discuss how survival analysis connects to classification and regression. On the other hand, we provide technical tools. We provide a new loss function, evaluation metrics, and the first universal approximating network that provably produces survival curves without numeric integration. We show that the loss function and model outperform other approaches using a large numerical study.",

    "translated_abstract": "生存分析是统计学工具箱中不可或缺的一部分。然而，虽然大多数经典统计领域已经接受了深度学习，但是生存分析直到最近才引起深度学习社区的一些注意。这一最近的发展可能部分受到COVID-19大流行的影响。我们的目标是提供在深度学习中充分利用生存分析潜力所需的工具。一方面，我们讨论了生存分析与分类和回归的关系。另一方面，我们提供了技术工具。我们提供一个新的损失函数、评估指标，以及第一个能够无需数值积分产生生存曲线的通用拟合网络。我们通过大规模的数值研究表明，这个损失函数和模型的性能优于其他方法。",
