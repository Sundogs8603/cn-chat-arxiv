    "translated_abstract": "最近，Miller基于著名的Halpern-Pearl（HP）因果和（非对比性）解释的定义，提出了对比性（反事实）解释的定义。关键是，Miller的定义基于原始的HP解释定义，但这已经被Halpern修改过了；可能是因为原始定义在许多标准示例中产生了违反直觉的结果。最近，Borner提出了第三个定义，观察到这个修改后的HP定义也可能产生违反直觉的结果。在本文中，我们展示了Miller定义中存在的问题继承自原始HP定义。我们通过提出两个基于更健壮的修改后的HP和Borner定义的改进版本来解决这些问题。我们分析了我们的新定义，并展示它们保留了Miller定义的精神，其中所有三个变体都满足一个与底层非对比性定义相关的另一个统一定义的模块化。",
