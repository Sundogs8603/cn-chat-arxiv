    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new constraint, called shift-consistency, for solving matrix/tensor completion problems in the context of recommender systems. Our method provably guarantees several key mathematical properties: (1) satisfies a recently established admissibility criterion for recommender systems; (2) satisfies a definition of fairness that eliminates a specific class of potential opportunities for users to maliciously influence system recommendations; and (3) offers robustness by exploiting provable uniqueness of missing-value imputation. We provide a rigorous mathematical description of the method, including its generalization from matrix to tensor form to permit representation and exploitation of complex structural relationships among sets of user and product attributes. We argue that our analysis suggests a structured means for defining latent-space projections that can permit provable performance properties to be established for machine learning methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了一种新的约束，称为移动一致性，用于解决推荐系统中的矩阵/张量完成问题。我们的方法能够证明保证一些关键的数学属性：（1）满足最近建立的用于推荐系统的可接受性准则；（2）满足一个定义公平性的条件，消除了用户对系统推荐的恶意影响的潜在机会；（3）通过利用可证明的缺失值插补的唯一性，提供了鲁棒性。我们提供了该方法的严格数学描述，包括从矩阵到张量形式的泛化，以便表示和利用用户和产品属性集之间的复杂结构关系。我们认为我们的分析提出了一种结构化方法，可以定义潜在空间投影，以便为机器学习方法建立可证明的性能特性。",
