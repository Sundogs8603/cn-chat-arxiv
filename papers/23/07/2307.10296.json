    "abstract": "Mammography images are widely used to detect non-palpable breast lesions or nodules, preventing cancer and providing the opportunity to plan interventions when necessary. The identification of some structures of interest is essential to make a diagnosis and evaluate image adequacy. Thus, computer-aided detection systems can be helpful in assisting medical interpretation by automatically segmenting these landmark structures. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based framework for the segmentation of the nipple, the pectoral muscle, the fibroglandular tissue, and the fatty tissue on standard-view mammography images. We introduce a large private segmentation dataset and extensive experiments considering different deep-learning model architectures. Our experiments demonstrate accurate segmentation performance on variate and challenging cases, showing that this framework can be integrated into clinical practice.",

    "translated_abstract": "乳腺X光摄影图像广泛用于检测不可触及的乳腺病变或结节，以预防癌症并在必要时提供干预的机会。识别一些感兴趣结构对于诊断和评估图像的充分性至关重要。因此，计算机辅助检测系统可以通过自动分割这些标志性结构来辅助医学解释。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于深度学习的框架，用于在标准视图乳腺X光摄影图像中分割乳头、胸大肌、纤维腺体组织和脂肪组织。我们引入了一个大型私有分割数据集，并进行了考虑不同深度学习模型架构的大量实验。我们的实验证明，在不同变异和具有挑战性的情况下具有准确的分割性能，表明该框架可以集成到临床实践中。",
