    "translated_abstract": "在这篇研究论文中，我们深入探讨了声音日历和自动语音识别（ASR）的主题。声音日历涉及将音频流中的个体发言者分离出来。通过使用ASR转录，日历过程旨在根据其独特的音频特征将每个发言者的发言分组。另一方面，自动语音识别是指机器或程序识别和转换口语词语和短语成为机器可读格式的能力。在我们的声音日历方法中，我们利用高斯混合模型（GMM）表示语音分段。基于GMM参数计算簇间距离，距离阈值作为停止准则。ASR包括将未知语音波形转换为相应的书面转录。语音信号使用同步算法进行分析，考虑到声音的音高。我们的主要目标是提高声音日历和ASR的准确性和效率。",
