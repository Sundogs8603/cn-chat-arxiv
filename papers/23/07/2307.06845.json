    "translated_abstract": "在自动化手术缝合中，准确感知缝合线是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为线的状态空间复杂，线的薄度和可变形性以及夹具和组织的可能遮挡。本文提出了一种在三维空间中跟踪手术线的方法，该方法对遮挡和复杂的线配置具有鲁棒性，并将其应用于自动执行手术缝合 \"尾部缩短\" 任务：将线拉通过组织直到所需的 \"尾部\" 长度保持暴露。该方法利用一个经过训练的二维手术线检测网络，在RGB图像中分割缝合线。然后，它在二维中识别线的路径，并通过从两个立体相机检测进行三角化，将线重建为三维的非均匀有理B样条曲线。一旦初始化了三维线模型，该方法会在随后的帧中跟踪线的移动。实验证明，该方法在具有挑战性的单帧三维线上达到1.33像素的平均重投影误差。",
