    "translated_abstract": "金融订单流表现出明显的持久性，买入（卖出）交易常常会在一定时间段后跟随着进一步的买入（卖出）交易。这种持久性可以归因于大订单的划分和逐步执行。因此，可能会出现不同的订单流模式，可以通过适用于市场数据的适当时间序列模型来识别。在本文中，我们提出了使用贝叶斯在线变点检测（BOCPD）方法来实时识别制度性转变，并实现订单流和市场影响的在线预测。为了提高我们方法的有效性，我们开发了一种使用评分驱动方法的新型BOCPD方法。该方法适应每个制度内的时间相关性和时间变化参数。通过对纳斯达克数据的实证应用，我们发现：（i）我们新提出的模型展示出优于现有假设独立同分布的模型的样本外预测性能。",
