    "translated_abstract": "强化学习已被证明可以学习复杂任务的高级控制策略，包括游戏、机器人、供暖与制冷系统和文本生成。然而，强化学习中的动作-感知循环通常假设在每个时间步都可以获得对环境状态的测量，且不产生成本。然而，在深海和行星机器人探索、材料设计和医学等应用中，测量或者近似环境状态可能会产生高昂的成本。本文调查了近来不断增长的文献，采取了RL代理可能不需要或者不想在每个时间步进行昂贵测量的观点。在这个背景下，我们提出了Deep Dynamic Multi-Step Observationless Agent (DMSOA)，并将其与文献进行对比，并在OpenAI gym和Atari Pong环境中进行了实证评估。我们的结果显示，DMSOA能够以更少的决策步骤和测量次数学到更好的策略。",
