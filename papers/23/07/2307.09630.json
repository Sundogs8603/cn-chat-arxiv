    "translated_abstract": "阿拉伯语具有许多复杂而丰富的形态学细微差别，这在分析传统的阿拉伯文本，特别是在历史和宗教语境中，对于理解文本的含义非常有用。词汇分离意味着将词语分解为诸如词根和词缀等不同部分。在形态学数据集中，标签的多样性和数据样本的数量有助于评估形态学方法。本文提出了一个基准数据集，用于评估分离阿拉伯词汇的方法，该数据集包含来自《伊斯兰教法》的约223,690个词汇，已由专家进行标记。就词汇量和种类而言，该数据集优于其他现有数据集，并且据我们所知，不存在阿拉伯哈迪斯领域的文本。为了评估该数据集，我们对数据集应用了不同的方法，如Farasa、Camel、Madamira和ALP，并通过四个参数报告了注释质量。",

It provides valuable insights for understanding the meaning of traditional Arabic texts and is the first dataset in the Arabic Hadith domain. The annotation quality is assessed using various methods."
