    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）在属性网络嵌入方面显示出了显著的性能。然而，现有的研究主要集中在利用网络结构，而对节点属性的利用相对较少，它们只在初始层作为节点特征。这种简单的策略限制了节点属性在增强节点连接方面的潜力，导致了对具有少量甚至没有邻居的非活动节点的有限感受域。此外，大多数GNN的训练目标（即重构网络结构）也不包括节点属性，尽管研究表明重构节点属性是有益的。因此，深入参与图卷积操作和训练目标等GNN关键组件中的节点属性是很有前景的。然而，这是一个非常重要的任务，因为需要适当的集成方式来保持GNN的优点。为了填补这个差距，在本文中，我们提出了协作式图神经网络...",
