    "abstract": "arXiv:2307.04644v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Recommender systems are effective tools for mitigating information overload and have seen extensive applications across various domains. However, the single focus on utility goals proves to be inadequate in addressing real-world concerns, leading to increasing attention to fairness-aware and diversity-aware recommender systems. While most existing studies explore fairness and diversity independently, we identify strong connections between these two domains. In this survey, we first discuss each of them individually and then dive into their connections. Additionally, motivated by the concepts of user-level and item-level fairness, we broaden the understanding of diversity to encompass not only the item level but also the user level. With this expanded perspective on user and item-level diversity, we re-interpret fairness studies from the viewpoint of diversity. This fresh perspective enhances our understanding of fairness-related work",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统是减轻信息过载的有效工具，并在各个领域广泛应用。然而，对效用目标的单一关注证明无法解决现实关切，导致对关注公平感知和多样性感知的推荐系统越来越重视。尽管大多数现有研究独立探讨公平和多样性，我们识别出这两个领域之间的紧密连接。在这项调查中，我们首先分别讨论它们，然后深入探讨它们之间的联系。此外，受用户级和物品级公平性概念的启发，我们将多样性的理解扩展到不仅包括物品级别，还包括用户级别。通过对用户和物品级别多样性的扩展观点，我们从多样性的角度重新解释公平性研究。这种新视角增进了我们对与公平有关的工作的理解。",
