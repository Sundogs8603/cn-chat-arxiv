    "abstract": "Well-calibrated traffic flow models are fundamental to understanding traffic phenomena and designing control strategies. Traditional calibration has been developed base on optimization methods. In this paper, we propose a novel physics-informed, learning-based calibration approach that achieves performances comparable to and even better than those of optimization-based methods. To this end, we combine the classical deep autoencoder, an unsupervised machine learning model consisting of one encoder and one decoder, with traffic flow models. Our approach informs the decoder of the physical traffic flow models and thus induces the encoder to yield reasonable traffic parameters given flow and speed measurements. We also introduce the denoising autoencoder into our method so that it can handles not only with normal data but also with corrupted data with missing values. We verified our approach with a case study of I-210 E in California.",

    "translated_abstract": "良好校准的交通流模型对于理解交通现象和设计控制策略至关重要。传统的校准方法是基于优化算法开发的。本文提出了一种新颖的基于物理信息化的学习方法，该方法在性能上与优化算法相当甚至更好。为了实现这一目标，我们将经典的深度自编码器与交通流模型相结合。我们的方法将物理交通流模型信息提供给解码器，从而使得编码器能够根据流量和速度测量结果得出合理的交通参数。我们还引入了去噪自编码器，使其不仅能处理正常数据，还能处理有缺失值的错误数据。我们通过对加利福尼亚州I-210 E的案例研究验证了我们的方法。",
