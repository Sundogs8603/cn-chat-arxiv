    "translated_title": "解锁视觉媒体的情感世界：理解情感的科学、研究和影响的概述",
    "translated_abstract": "人工情感智能技术的出现正在革新计算机和机器人领域，实现了一种对人类行为的沟通和理解的新水平，这曾经被认为是不可能的。虽然深度学习的最新进展已经改变了计算机视觉领域，但对视觉媒体中引发或表达的情感进行自动理解仍处于起步阶段。这一困境源于“情感”缺乏普遍接受的定义，加上情感的主观性和微妙的细微差别。在本文中，我们提供了一份全面的、多学科的视觉媒体情感分析领域概述，借鉴了心理学、工程学和艺术的见解。我们首先探讨情感的心理学基础和从图像和视频中理解情感的计算原理。然后，我们回顾了最新的研究和系统。",
