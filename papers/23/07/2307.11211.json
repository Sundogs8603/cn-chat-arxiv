    "abstract": "Background: Mental illness can lead to adverse outcomes such as homelessness and police interaction and understanding of the events leading up to these adverse outcomes is important. Predictive models may help identify individuals at risk of such adverse outcomes. Using a fixed observation window cohort with logistic regression (LR) or machine learning (ML) models can result in lower performance when compared with adaptive and parcellated windows. Method: An administrative healthcare dataset was used, comprising of 240,219 individuals in Calgary, Alberta, Canada who were diagnosed with addiction or mental health (AMH) between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2018. The cohort was followed for 2 years to identify factors associated with homelessness and police interactions. To understand the benefit of flexible windows to predictive models, an alternative cohort was created. Then LR and ML models, including random forests (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were compared in the two",
