    "translated_abstract": "精确模拟可变形线性物体（DLO）的动力学在需要一个可以被人解读和数据高效的模型并能够提供快速预测的任务中是具有挑战性的。为了得到这样的模型，我们借鉴了刚性有限元方法（R-FEM），将DLO建模为一系列刚体链，其内部状态通过动力学网络以时间展开。由于该状态不能直接观察到，动力学网络与一个物理感知的编码器共同训练，将观察到的运动变量映射到刚体链的状态。为了促使状态获得物理上有意义的表示，我们利用底层R-FEM模型的正运动学（FK）作为解码器。我们在一个机器人实验中证明，这种被称为“有限元启发网络”的架构是一个易于处理但功能强大的DLO动力学模型，可以从部分观察中得出具有物理解释性的预测。",
