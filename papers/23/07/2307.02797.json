    "translated_abstract": "在个性化推荐系统领域，人们越来越关注的是信念失衡和用户偏见的加剧现象，这一现象主要归因于过滤泡沫。针对这一关键问题，我们引入了一种创新的中介机构（BHEISR），将其置于用户和现有推荐系统之间，以减轻过滤泡沫效应在现有推荐系统中产生的负面影响。主要目标是为用户创造信念平衡，同时最小化过滤泡沫带来的不利影响。BHEISR模型融合了“推动理论”的原则，同时秉持民主和透明的原则。它利用用户特定的类别信息来激发好奇心，即使在用户可能最初认为不感兴趣的领域。通过逐步激发对新领域的兴趣，该模型鼓励用户拓宽信念视野并探索他们通常忽视的信息。我们的模型具有时间敏感性。",
