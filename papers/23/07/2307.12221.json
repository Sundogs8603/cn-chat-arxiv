    "title": "FATRER: Full-Attention Topic Regularizer for Accurate and Robust Conversational Emotion Recognition. (arXiv:2307.12221v1 [cs.CL])",
    "abstract": "This paper concentrates on the understanding of interlocutors' emotions evoked in conversational utterances. Previous studies in this literature mainly focus on more accurate emotional predictions, while ignoring model robustness when the local context is corrupted by adversarial attacks. To maintain robustness while ensuring accuracy, we propose an emotion recognizer augmented by a full-attention topic regularizer, which enables an emotion-related global view when modeling the local context in a conversation. A joint topic modeling strategy is introduced to implement regularization from both representation and loss perspectives. To avoid over-regularization, we drop the constraints on prior distributions that exist in traditional topic modeling and perform probabilistic approximations based entirely on attention alignment. Experiments show that our models obtain more favorable results than state-of-the-art models, and gain convincing robustness under three types of adversarial attacks",

    "translated_abstract": "本文关注于理解会话话语中引发的对话者情绪。之前的研究主要关注于更准确的情感预测，而忽视了当局部上下文被对抗性攻击破坏时模型的稳健性。为了在保证准确性的同时维持稳健性，我们提出了一种由全注意力主题正则化器增强的情感识别器，在建模对话中的局部上下文时实现情感相关的全局视角。引入联合主题建模策略，从表示和损失的角度实现正则化。为了避免过度正则化，我们放弃了传统主题建模中存在的关于先验分布的限制，并完全依靠注意力对齐进行概率近似。实验证明，我们的模型比现有最先进的模型获得了更有利的结果，并在三种类型的对抗性攻击下获得了令人信服的稳健性。",
