    "translated_abstract": "解决量子多体Schr\\\"odinger方程是量子物理、量子化学和材料科学领域中一个基本而具有挑战性的问题。针对这个问题，一种常见的计算方法是量子变分蒙特卡洛（QVMC），其中通过在一个参数化波函数族中最小化系统的能量来获得基态解。深度学习方法在一定程度上解决了传统QVMC的局限性，通过使用神经网络表示丰富的波函数族。然而，在QVMC中优化目标仍然难以最小化，需要使用自然梯度等二阶优化方法。本文首先重新制定了能量泛函的最小化问题，将其转化为Born分布空间中的粒子排列（反）对称波函数的问题，而不是波函数的空间。然后我们将QVMC解释为在这个空间中的Fisher-Rao梯度流。",
