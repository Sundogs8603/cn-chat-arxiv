    "translated_abstract": "自动化做市商（AMMs）是一种正在改变市场参与者互动方式的新型交易场所。目前，大多数AMMs是恒定函数做市商（CFMMs），其中确定性交易函数决定了市场的清算方式。CFMMs的一个显著特点是执行成本是价格、流动性和交易规模的一个闭合形式函数。这导致了一类新的交易问题。我们重点关注恒定产品做市商，并展示了如何在资产中进行最佳交易并基于市场信号执行统计套利。我们使用随机最优控制工具设计了两种策略。一种策略是基于竞争场所中价格的动态，并假定AMM中的流动性是恒定的。另一种策略假设AMM的价格是高效的，流动性是随机的。我们使用Uniswap v3的数据来研究价格、流动性和交易成本的动态。",
