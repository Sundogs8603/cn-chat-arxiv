    "abstract": "Imitation learning suffers from causal confusion. This phenomenon occurs when learned policies attend to features that do not causally influence the expert actions but are instead spuriously correlated. Causally confused agents produce low open-loop supervised loss but poor closed-loop performance upon deployment. We consider the problem of masking observed confounders in a disentangled representation of the observation space. Our novel masking algorithm leverages the usual ability to intervene in the initial system state, avoiding any requirement involving expert querying, expert reward functions, or causal graph specification. Under certain assumptions, we theoretically prove that this algorithm is conservative in the sense that it does not incorrectly mask observations that causally influence the expert; furthermore, intervening on the initial state serves to strictly reduce excess conservatism. The masking algorithm is applied to behavior cloning for two illustrative control system",

    "translated_abstract": "模仿学习存在因果混淆问题，即学习策略关注的特征并不因果地影响专家的行为，而是表面上的相关性。因果混淆的智能体在训练中产生了低的开环监督损失，但在部署时表现出差的闭环性能。我们考虑在观测空间的分离表示中遮蔽已观测到的混淆因素的问题。我们提出了一种新的遮蔽算法，利用了对初始系统状态进行干预的能力，避免了对专家查询、专家奖励函数或因果图规范的任何要求。在一定的假设下，我们在理论上证明了该算法是保守的，即不会错误地遮蔽因果相关的观测；此外，对初始状态的干预能够严格减少过度保守性。该遮蔽算法被应用于两个示例控制系统的行为克隆中。",
