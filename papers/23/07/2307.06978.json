Unfortunately, the limited availability of labelled training data hinders the development of the statistical models on which these decision-support systems rely. Population-based SHM seeks to mitigate the impact of data scarcity by using transfer learning techniques to share information between individual structures within a population. The current paper proposes a decision framework for selecting transfer strategies based upon a novel concept -- the expected value of information transfer -such that negative transfer is avoided. By avoiding negative transfer, and by optimising information transfer strategies using the transfer-decision framework, one can reduce the costs associated with operating and maintaining structures, and improve safety.",

    "translated_abstract": "结构健康监测系统的开发和实施为结构的运维提供了重要支持，然而，标记训练数据的有限性制约了决策支持系统所依赖的统计模型的发展。人群结构健康监测通过使用迁移学习技术，在个体结构之间共享信息以减轻数据稀缺性带来的影响。本文提出了一个基于“信息传输期望价值”的决策框架，用于选择传输策略，并避免负面传输。通过避免负面传输，并使用传输决策框架优化信息传输策略，可以减少运营和维护结构所需的成本，并提高安全性。",
