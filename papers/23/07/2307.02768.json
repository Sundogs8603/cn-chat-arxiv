We propose PATTERNREFRAME, a novel dataset of about 10k examples of thoughts containing unhelpful thought patterns conditioned on a given persona, accompanied by about 27k positive reframes.

    "translated_abstract": "在过去几十年中，许多认知方法来提高幸福感，例如识别和重构无益思维，得到了相当多的实证支持，但在自助格式下仍缺乏广泛采纳。其中一个原因是缺乏充分具体且多样化的专门练习材料。本研究探讨当前语言模型是否可以利用来产生大量的练习材料，展示与特定上下文匹配的常见无益思维模式，并生成适当的积极重构建议。我们提出了一个名为PATTERNREFRAME的新数据集，包含约1万个以给定角色为条件的包含无益思维模式的例子，并附带大约2.7万个积极的重构建议。通过使用该数据集对当前模型进行训练和/或评估，我们展示现有模型已经可以成为一个有力的工具，帮助生成量身定制的练习材料和假设，且不需或只需最少的人工修改。",
