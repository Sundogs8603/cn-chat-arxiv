    "abstract": "In this paper we further extend the optimal bubble riding model proposed by Tangpi and Wang by allowing for price-dependent entry times. Agents are characterized by their individual entry threshold that represents their belief in the strength of the bubble. Conversely, the growth dynamics of the bubble is fueled by the influx of players. Price-dependent entry naturally leads to a mean field game of controls with common noise and random entry time, for which we provide an existence result. The equilibrium is obtained by first solving discretized versions of the game in the weak formulation and then examining the measurability property in the limit. In this paper, the common noise comes from two sources: the price of the asset which all agents trade, and also the exogenous bubble burst time, which we also discretize and incorporate into the model via progressive enlargement of filtration.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过允许价格相关的进入时间进一步扩展了唐派和王提出的最佳泡沫乘车模型。代理商通过个体进入阈值来表示他们对泡沫强度的信念。而泡沫的增长动力则来源于玩家的涌入。价格相关的进入自然地引导了一个带有共同噪音和随机进入时间的控制均值场博弈，我们提供了一个存在性结果。平衡通过首先解决弱形式下的离散化游戏，然后在极限中检验可测性性质来获得。本文中，共同噪音来自两个来源：所有代理商交易的资产价格，以及外生泡沫破裂时间，我们还通过渐进增大滤波来离散化并将其纳入模型。",
