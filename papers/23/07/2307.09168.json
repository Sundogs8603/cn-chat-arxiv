    "translated_abstract": "通过引入循环和循环公式的概念，Lin和Zhao证明了一个非不相交逻辑程序的答案集就是满足所有循环的循环公式的Clark完成模型。最近，Gebser和Schaub证明了即使我们将循环公式限制在一种称为\"基本循环\"的特殊类型的循环中，Lin-Zhao定理仍然正确。在本文中，我们简化和推广了基本循环的概念，并澄清了它的角色。我们提出了基本集合的概念，它几乎等价于非不相交程序的基本循环的概念，但更简单，并且与基本循环不同，可以扩展到包含非直观结果的不相交程序。我们证明了对于程序的\"相关\"部分来说，最大的未定基本集合恰好是非空未定集合中的最小集合。我们还提出了一个基于图论的非不相交程序基本集合的特征化。",
