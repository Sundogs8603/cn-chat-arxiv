    "translated_abstract": "隔离性流行病模型根据个体的疾病状态将其分类，如SEIRD模型（易感-暴露-感染-康复-死亡）。这些模型确定了影响爆发规模的参数，如传染和康复率。然而，它们没有考虑个体特征或人口行为，这对评估缓解策略（如COVID-19中的口罩使用或HIV中的避孕套分发）至关重要。此外，研究强调公民团结、人际信任和政府信誉在解释国家之间传染率差异方面的作用。代理建模（ABM）通过模拟个体组成部分、其行为和环境内的相互作用提供了研究复杂系统的有价值方法。ABM为分析社会现象提供了有用的工具。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种将适应的SEIRD模型与决策模型相结合的ABM架构，以模拟病毒的扩展。",
