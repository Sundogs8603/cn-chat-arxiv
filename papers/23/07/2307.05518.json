    "translated_abstract": "本文关注于通过程序化生成规则并将其传达给玩家以调整难度。这是一个更大的项目的一部分，旨在使用旨在幼儿园的数字益智游戏在教育游戏中收集和调整游戏。该方法使用遗传算法与难度测量一起，找到一组解的目标数量，并使用大型语言模型在叙事背景下传达规则。在测试过程中，该方法能够在平均两打代之内找到逼近任何给定目标难度的规则。该方法结合了大型语言模型，创建了一个叙事益智游戏，玩家必须为不能相处的动物举办一次晚宴。未来的实验将尝试改进评估，让语言模型专门针对儿童文学，并收集玩家的多模态数据来指导适应。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a method for procedurally generating and communicating rules to players, enabling them to adjust the difficulty of narrative puzzle games. The approach combines genetic algorithms and a difficulty measure to find a target number of solution sets, and utilizes a large language model to convey the rules in a narrative context. The method successfully finds rules that approximate any given target difficulty and creates an engaging narrative puzzle game where players have to host a dinner for animals that can't get along. Future work aims to improve evaluation, specialize the language model for children's literature, and collect multi-modal data from players to guide adaptive difficulty."
