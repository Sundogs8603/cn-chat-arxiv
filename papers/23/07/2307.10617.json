Businesses may embed fake reviews in order to attract customers to purchase their products. They may even highlight the benefits of their own product or criticize the competition's product.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，在线评论在推广任何产品或服务方面发挥着重要作用。企业可能会嵌入虚假评论以吸引客户购买他们的产品。他们甚至可能突出强调自己产品的优点或批评竞争对手的产品。市场营销人员、广告商和其他在线商业用户有动机为他们想要推广的产品编写虚假的正面评论，或者为他们真正不喜欢的产品提供虚假的负面评论。因此，识别虚假评论是一个紧迫且持续的研究领域。本研究论文提出了一种机器学习模型方法来识别虚假评论。论文调查了在一个餐馆评论的虚假意见垃圾语料库数据集上进行的多次实验的性能。我们采用了n-gram模型和最大特征来识别虚假评论。",
