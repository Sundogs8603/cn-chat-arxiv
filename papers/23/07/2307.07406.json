    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种改进的收敛分析技术，描述了具有不完美/噪声上行和下行通信的联邦学习（FL）的分布式学习范式。这种不完美的通信场景在新兴通信系统和协议中实际部署FL时出现。本文中开发的分析首次证明了FL中上行和下行通信的不利影响存在不对称性。特别是，下行噪声的不利影响对FL算法的收敛更为严重。基于这个观察，我们提出了改进的信噪比（SNR）控制策略，通过丢弃可忽略的高阶项，使FL的收敛速率与完美的、无噪声的通信信道情况下相似，同时比现有解决方案节省了大量的功率资源。特别地，我们确立了维持$O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{K}})$收敛速率所需的信噪比控制策略。",
