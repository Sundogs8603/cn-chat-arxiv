We propose a framework, called BALLET, which adaptively filters for a high-confidence region of interest (ROI) as a superlevel-set of a nonparametric probabilistic model such as a Gaussian process (GP). Our approach is easy to tune, and is able to focus on local region of the optimization space that can be tackled by existing BO methods. The key idea is to use two probabilistic models: a coarse GP to identify the ROI, and a localized GP for optimization within the ROI. We show theoretically that BALLET can efficiently shrink the search space, and can exhibit a tighter regret bound than standard BO without ROI filtering. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of BALLET on both synthetic and real-world optimization tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在高维和非平稳场景下的贝叶斯优化（BO）。现有的算法通常需要大量的超参数调整，限制了它们的实际有效性。我们提出了一个名为BALLET的框架，该框架以非参数概率模型（如高斯过程）的超级级集的高置信度感兴趣区域（ROI）为自适应过滤器。我们的方法易于调整，并且能够专注于可以通过现有的BO方法解决的优化空间的局部区域。关键思想是使用两个概率模型：一个粗糙的高斯过程用于识别ROI，一个局部高斯过程用于ROI内的优化。我们理论上证明了BALLET可以高效地缩小搜索空间，并且比标准的无ROI过滤的BO具有更紧的遗憾界限。我们在合成和真实世界的优化任务中经验性地证明了BALLET的有效性。",
