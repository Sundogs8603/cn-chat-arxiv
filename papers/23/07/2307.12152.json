    "translated_abstract": "随着移动设备在视频流媒体方面的受欢迎程度不断增加，优化这些设备的流媒体体验至关重要。虽然基于深度学习的视频增强技术引起了广泛关注，但大多数技术不能在移动设备上支持实时增强。此外，许多技术仅关注超分辨率，无法处理视频帧的部分或完全丢失或损坏，而这在互联网和无线网络上非常常见。为了克服这些挑战，本文提出了一种新颖的方法。我们的方法包括（i）一种新颖的视频帧恢复方案，（ii）一种新的超分辨率算法，以及（iii）一种接收增强感知的视频比特率自适应算法。我们在iPhone 12上实现了我们的方法，并且支持每秒30帧（FPS）。我们在WiFi、3G、4G和5G网络等不同网络上评估了我们的方法。评估结果表明，我们的方法能够实现实时增强。",
