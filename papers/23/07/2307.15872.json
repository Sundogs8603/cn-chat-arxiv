    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，卷积神经网络已经在各种图像分析和计算机视觉应用中取得了突破性进展，2D图像分类网络的性能不断提升，并且在由数百万自然图片组成的数据库上进行训练。然而，由于医学图像分析中存在有限的标注数据和获取约束，进展受到了限制。考虑到医学成像数据的容积性，这些限制尤为明显。在本文中，我们引入了一种有效的方法，将在自然图像上训练的2D分类网络的效能迁移到2D、3D单模态和多模态的医学图像分割应用中。在这个方向上，我们设计了基于两个关键原理的新型架构：通过将2D预训练编码器嵌入到更高维度的U-Net中进行权重转移，以及通过将2D分割网络扩展到更高维度的网络进行维度转移。所提出的网络经过了测试...",
