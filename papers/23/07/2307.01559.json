Adopting an edge-fog computational paradigm, we can offload part of the computation to the fog; however, this poses security concerns if the fog node, or the communication link, can not be trusted. To tackle this concern, we propose a novel distributed edge-fog execution scheme that validates fog computation by redundantly executing a random subnetwork aboard our nano-drone. Compared to a State-of-the-Art visual pose estimation network that entirely runs onboard, a larger network executed in a distributed way improves the $R^2$ score by +0.19; in case of attack, our approach detects it within 2s with 95% probability.",

    "translated_abstract": "手掌大小的纳米无人机是一种吸引人的边缘节点类别，但它们的计算资源有限，无法在机载上运行大型深度学习模型。采用边缘-雾计算范式，我们可以将部分计算卸载到雾中，然而，如果不能信任雾节点或通信链路，这将带来安全问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的分布式边缘-雾执行方案，通过在纳米无人机上冗余执行随机子网络来验证雾计算。与完全在机载上运行的最先进视觉姿态估计网络相比，以分布式方式执行的更大网络的$R^2$得分提高了+0.19；在攻击的情况下，我们的方法能够在2秒内以95%的概率检测到。",
