    "abstract": "We study the real economic activity in the Bitcoin blockchain that involves transactions from/to retail users rather than between organizations such as marketplaces, exchanges, or other services. We first introduce a heuristic method to classify Bitcoin players into three main categories: Frequent Receivers (FR), Neighbors of FR, and Others. We show that most real transactions involve Frequent Receivers, representing a small fraction of the total value exchanged according to the blockchain, but a significant fraction of all payments, raising concerns about the centralization of the Bitcoin ecosystem. We also conduct a weekly pattern analysis of activity, providing insights into the geographical location of Bitcoin users and allowing us to quantify the bias of a well-known dataset for actor identification.",
