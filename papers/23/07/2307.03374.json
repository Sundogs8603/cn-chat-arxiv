    "abstract": "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a powerful technique that has gained popularity due to its performance improvement over traditional Single-Task Learning (STL). However, MTL is often challenging because there is an exponential number of possible task groupings, which can make it difficult to choose the best one, and some groupings might produce performance degradation due to negative interference between tasks. Furthermore, existing solutions are severely suffering from scalability issues, limiting any practical application. In our paper, we propose a new data-driven method that addresses these challenges and provides a scalable and modular solution for classification task grouping based on hand-crafted features, specifically Data Maps, which capture the training behavior for each classification task during the MTL training. We experiment with the method demonstrating its effectiveness, even on an unprecedented number of tasks (up to 100).",

    "translated_abstract": "多任务学习是一种强大的技术，因其相对于传统的单任务学习而言具有性能改进而受到欢迎。然而，多任务学习往往具有挑战性，因为可能的任务分组数量呈指数增长，这使得选择最佳任务分组变得困难，并且一些分组可能会由于任务之间的负面干扰而导致性能下降。此外，现有解决方案严重受到可伸缩性问题的困扰，限制了实际应用。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的数据驱动方法，解决了这些挑战，并提供了一种基于手工特征，特别是数据映射的分类任务分组的可伸缩和模块化解决方案。我们的实验证明了该方法的有效性，即使在前所未有的任务数量下（高达100个）。",
