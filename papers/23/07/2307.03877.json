    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）的发展使人类能够与机器共同创作内容。AI生成的内容的意外性可以给用户带来灵感和娱乐。然而，共同创作交互总是面向内容创作者设计的，可访问性差。为了探索混合倡议共创的游戏化，并使人工智能与人类的交互对玩家来说既有趣又易于接触，我设计了一个原型游戏“蛇的故事”，玩家可以通过玩一个类似“贪吃蛇”的游戏来选择AI生成的文本来编写一个蛇的故事。通过进行一项有控制组实验，探讨了在设计的界面中玩家和AI之间的相互作用动力学。通过对11名玩家（n=11）进行研究，我发现当玩家与两个版本一起玩时，他们采用不同的策略，游戏机制显著影响了输出的故事、玩家的创造过程以及角色的认知，不同的玩家的创造性过程受到不同的影响。",
