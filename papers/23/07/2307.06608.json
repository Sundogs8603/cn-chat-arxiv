    "translated_abstract": "最近，无盒对抗攻击成为了最实用且具有挑战性的攻击方式，攻击者无法访问模型的架构、权重和训练数据。然而，在无盒设置中，对于代理模型选择过程的潜力和灵活性缺乏认识。受到利用基础模型解决下游任务的兴趣的启发，本文采用了1）将对抗攻击重新设定为下游任务，具体而言，是生成图像噪声以满足新兴趋势；2）将基础模型引入作为代理模型的创新思想。通过利用非鲁棒特征的概念，我们阐述了选择代理模型的两个指导原则，以解释为什么基础模型是这一角色的最佳选择。然而，矛盾地的是，我们观察到这些基础模型表现不佳。通过在特征空间中分析这种意外行为，我们归因于缺乏上述指导原则所需的特征。",
