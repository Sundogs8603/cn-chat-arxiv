    "abstract": "Contrastive Analysis VAE (CA-VAEs) is a family of Variational auto-encoders (VAEs) that aims at separating the common factors of variation between a background dataset (BG) (i.e., healthy subjects) and a target dataset (TG) (i.e., patients) from the ones that only exist in the target dataset. To do so, these methods separate the latent space into a set of salient features (i.e., proper to the target dataset) and a set of common features (i.e., exist in both datasets). Currently, all models fail to prevent the sharing of information between latent spaces effectively and to capture all salient factors of variation. To this end, we introduce two crucial regularization losses: a disentangling term between common and salient representations and a classification term between background and target samples in the salient space. We show a better performance than previous CA-VAEs methods on three medical applications and a natural images dataset (CelebA). Code and datasets are available on GitHu",

    "translated_abstract": "对比分析VAE（CA-VAEs）是一类变分自编码器（VAEs），旨在从背景数据集（BG）（即健康人群）和目标数据集（TG）（即患者）之间分离共同变化因素和仅存在于目标数据集中的因素。为此，这些方法将潜在空间分为一组显著特征（即特定于目标数据集）和一组共同特征（即存在于两个数据集中）。目前，所有模型都未能有效防止潜在空间之间的信息共享，并捕捉所有显著的变化因素。为此，我们引入了两个关键的正则化损失：共同表示和显著表示之间的解缠绕项，以及显著空间中背景和目标样本之间的分类项。我们展示了对三个医学应用和一个自然图像数据集（CelebA）的先前CA-VAEs方法的更好性能。代码和数据集可在GitHub上获取。",
