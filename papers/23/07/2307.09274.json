    "translated_abstract": "近年来，连体网络已成为建模文本语义相似性的一种流行方法。传统方法依赖池化操作来压缩编码中Transformer块的语义表示，从而得到二维语义向量并丢失Transformer块中的层次化语义信息。此外，这种有限的语义向量结构类似于一个被铺平的地形，限制了下游建模中可以应用的方法，因为它们只能在这个平面上进行导航。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的用于文本语义相似性建模的3D连体网络，它将语义信息映射到一个更高维的空间中。三维语义张量不仅保留了更精确的空间和特征领域信息，还为全面的下游建模策略提供了必要的结构条件来捕捉这些信息。利用这种结构上的优势，我们引入了几个模块",
