    "abstract": "We develop new methods for changes-in-changes and distributional synthetic controls when there exists group level heterogeneity. For changes-in-changes, we allow individuals to belong to a large number of heterogeneous groups. The new method extends the changes-in-changes method in Athey and Imbens (2006) by finding appropriate subgroups within the control groups which share similar group level unobserved characteristics to the treatment groups. For distributional synthetic control, we show that the appropriate synthetic control needs to be constructed using units in potentially different time periods in which they have comparable group level heterogeneity to the treatment group, instead of units that are only in the same time period as in Gunsilius (2023). Implementation and data requirements for these new methods are briefly discussed.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们在存在团体层面异质性的情况下，开发了新的方法来处理改变中的改变和分布式合成对照。对于改变中的改变，我们允许个体属于大量异质群体。新方法扩展了Athey和Imbens（2006）的改变中的改变方法，通过找到控制组内与处理组具有相似团体层面未观测特征的适当子群来进行改进。对于分布式合成对照，我们表明适当的合成对照需要使用在不同时间段内具有与处理组相当的团体层面异质性的单位进行构建，而不仅仅是像Gunsilius（2023）中的相同时间段的单位。我们简要讨论了这些新方法的实施和数据要求。",
