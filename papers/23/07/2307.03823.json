    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated the positive impact of incorporating linguistic representations as additional context and scaffolding on the in-domain performance of several NLP tasks. We extend this work by exploring the impact of linguistic representations on cross-domain performance in a few-shot transfer setting. An important question is whether linguistic representations enhance generalizability by providing features that function as cross-domain pivots. We focus on the task of relation extraction on three datasets of procedural text in two domains, cooking and materials science. Our approach augments a popular transformer-based architecture by alternately incorporating syntactic and semantic graphs constructed by freely available off-the-shelf tools. We examine their utility for enhancing generalization, and investigate whether earlier findings, e.g. that semantic representations can be more helpful than syntactic ones, extend to relation extraction in multiple domains. We find that",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究已经证明将语言表示作为额外的上下文和支持信息加入到多个NLP任务的领域内性能中可以产生积极影响。我们通过在几次迁移学习环境中探索语言表示对跨领域性能的影响，对这些研究进行了扩展。一个重要的问题是，语言表示是否通过提供作为跨领域中心的特征来增强泛化能力。我们关注在两个领域（烹饪和材料科学）中的三个程序性文本数据集上的关系抽取任务。我们的方法通过交替地使用通过免费提供的现成工具构建的句法和语义图来扩充流行的基于Transformer的架构。我们考察了它们在增强泛化能力方面的实用性，并调查了早期发现，例如语义表示比句法表示更有帮助，是否适用于多个领域的关系抽取。我们发现",
