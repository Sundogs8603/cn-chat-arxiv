    "translated_abstract": "通过在研究领域内组织知识，系统性综述（SR）为研究提供了宝贵的线索。有证据表明，SR已成为软件工程中一流的艺术品。然而，SR筛选阶段所需的繁琐手动工作使得这些研究变得昂贵且容易出错。尽管传统上认为筛选不适合自动化，但基于大型语言模型支持的生成式AI驱动的聊天机器人的出现将改变这一情况。在本报告中，我们提出了一种利用这些新技术发展自动化SR筛选的方法。我们评估了ChatGPT在SR文章筛选中的一致性、分类性能和推广能力，并将这些数据与传统用于SR自动化的分类器进行比较。我们的结果表明，ChatGPT是自动化SR过程的可行选择，但开发者在集成时需要仔细考虑。",
