    "translated_abstract": "作为一种高效的分布式机器学习方法，联邦学习（FL）可以通过在用户端进行迭代的本地模型训练和在中央服务器端进行全局模型聚合来获得共享模型，从而保护用户的隐私。在FL系统中，移动用户通过无线信道与基站（BSs）通信，用户的移动性可能导致可靠性下降，从而影响训练性能。然而，现有的工作只研究了静态场景或随机初始化的用户位置，未能捕捉到现实网络中的移动性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个实际的用户移动模型，跨多个基站进行FL，并开发了一种用户调度和资源分配方法，以最小化在通信资源受限的情况下的训练延迟。具体而言，我们首先对具有用户移动性的优化问题进行了建模，同时考虑了用户选择、给用户分配的BS和带宽分配，以最小化训练延迟。",
