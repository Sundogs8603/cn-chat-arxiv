    "translated_abstract": "随着世界在技术和健康方面的进步，通过揭示无症状的迹象来提高对疾病的认识变得越来越重要。及早检测和治疗肿瘤非常重要，因为它可能危及生命。计算机辅助技术被用来克服疾病诊断中存在的局限性，而脑肿瘤分割仍然是一个困难的过程，尤其是在涉及多模态数据时。这主要是由于数据和对应标注的缺乏导致的训练效果不佳。本研究探讨了使用深度伪造图像生成进行有效脑肿瘤分割的可行性。为此，使用生成对抗网络进行图像到图像的转换以增加数据集大小，然后使用基于U-Net的卷积神经网络对深度伪造图像进行图像分割训练。将所提出的方法的性能与四个公开数据集的基本事实进行比较。结果表明，在性能方面取得了提高。",
