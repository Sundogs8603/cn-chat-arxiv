Their performances degrade substantially when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. To fill the need for a reliable algorithm for combinatorial and mixed spaces, this paper proposes Bounce that relies on a novel map of various variable types into nested embeddings of increasing dimensionality.

    "translated_abstract": "具有显著影响力的应用，如材料发现、硬件设计、神经架构搜索或组合优化要求优化混合和组合输入空间中的高维黑盒函数。尽管贝叶斯优化在解决这些问题方面取得了显著进展，但深入分析表明目前最先进的方法并不可靠。当函数的未知最优解没有特定结构时，它们的性能会大幅下降。为了满足对组合和混合空间可靠算法的需求，本文提出了一种依赖于将各种变量类型映射为逐渐增加维度的嵌入的新颖映射Bounce。全面的实验表明，Bounce在各种高维问题上可靠地实现并通常甚至超越了最先进的性能。",
