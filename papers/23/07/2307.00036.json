    "abstract": "Objective: To determine whether machine learning methods can generate useful potion recipes for research and teaching at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Design: Using deep neural networks to classify generated recipes into a standard drug classification system. Setting: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Data sources: 72 potion recipes from the Hogwarts curriculum, extracted from the Harry Potter Wiki. Results: Most generated recipes fall into the categories of psychoanaleptics and dermatologicals. The number of recipes predicted for each category reflected the number of training recipes. Predicted probabilities were often above 90% but some recipes were classified into 2 or more categories with similar probabilities which complicates anticipating the predicted effects. Conclusions: Machine learning powered methods are able to generate potentially useful potion recipes for teaching and research at Hogwarts. This corresponds to similar efforts in the non-magical wor",

    "translated_abstract": "目标：确定机器学习方法是否能够为霍格沃茨魔法学校的研究和教学生成有用的魔药配方。设计：使用深度神经网络将生成的配方分类到标准药物分类系统中。数据来源：从哈利波特维基中提取的霍格沃茨课程的72个魔药配方。结果：大多数生成的配方属于兴奋剂和皮肤药品的类别。每个类别的预测配方数量与训练配方数量相对应。预测的概率通常超过90%，但有些配方被分类到2个或更多具有相似概率的类别中，这增加了对预测效果的预期的复杂性。结论：基于机器学习的方法能够为霍格沃茨魔法学校的教学和研究生成潜在有用的魔药配方。这与非魔法世界中的类似努力相一致。",
