    "translated_abstract": "随着越来越多的智能设备，如物联网设备，部署在实际场景中，将神经网络的训练任务转移到中央服务器变得越来越不可行。为了提高用户隐私，最近出现了在设备上进行学习的替代方案。然而，仅使用单个设备上的本地数据进行训练的模型很难达到高准确性。联邦学习被引入作为一种解决方案，通过在设备之间共享知识但不公开设备的私有数据，提供了在通信开销和模型准确性之间的隐私权衡。然而，在许多相关的使用案例中，应用基线的联邦学习的适用性和好处受到限制，原因是环境中存在异构性。本调研概述了联邦学习在真实应用中需要克服的异构性挑战。我们特别关注参与方中的计算异构性方面。",
