    "translated_abstract": "社交编码平台在软件开发中彻底改变了合作方式，导致使用软件机器人来简化运营。然而，开源软件（OSS）机器人的存在带来了伪装、垃圾邮件、偏见和安全风险等问题。在OSS项目中识别机器人账号和行为是一项具有挑战性的任务。本研究旨在研究开源软件项目中的机器人行为，并以尽可能高的准确性识别机器人账号。我们的团队收集了一组满足标准化标准的19,779个账号的数据集，以便未来对开源项目中的机器人进行研究。我们遵循严格的工作流程，确保我们收集的数据准确、具有普适性、可扩展并保持最新。通过分析开源软件项目中机器人账号在5个维度的17个特征上的行为，我们已经确定了四种类型的机器人账号。我们的团队创建了BotHawk，这是一个在开源软件项目中高效检测机器人的模型。",
