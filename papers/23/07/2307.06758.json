    "abstract": "In this paper we present a layered approach for multi-agent control problem, decomposed into three stages, each building upon the results of the previous one. First, a high-level plan for a coarse abstraction of the system is computed, relying on parametric timed automata augmented with stopwatches as they allow to efficiently model simplified dynamics of such systems. In the second stage, the high-level plan, based on SMT-formulation, mainly handles the combinatorial aspects of the problem, provides a more dynamically accurate solution. These stages are collectively referred to as the SWA-SMT solver. They are correct by construction but lack a crucial feature: they cannot be executed in real time. To overcome this, we use SWA-SMT solutions as the initial training dataset for our last stage, which aims at obtaining a neural network control policy. We use reinforcement learning to train the policy, and show that the initial dataset is crucial for the overall success of the method.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种分层控制方法，用于解决多智能体系统的控制问题。该方法分为三个阶段，每个阶段都建立在前一个阶段的结果基础上。首先，计算系统的粗略抽象的高级计划，使用增加了秒表的参数化定时自动机来有效地模拟这种系统的简化动力学。在第二阶段，基于SMT表述的高级计划主要处理问题的组合方面，提供了更动态准确的解决方案。这些阶段统称为SWA-SMT求解器，它们是构造正确的，但缺乏一个关键特性：不能实时执行。为了克服这个问题，我们将SWA-SMT的解作为最后一个阶段的初始训练数据集，该阶段旨在获得一个神经网络控制策略。我们使用强化学习来训练策略，并且证明初始数据集对于整个方法的成功至关重要。",
