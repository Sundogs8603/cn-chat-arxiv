    "abstract": "This research examines the correlations between the return volatility of cryptocurrencies, global stock market indices, and the spillover effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, we employed a two-stage multivariate volatility exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model with an integrated dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) approach to measure the impact on the financial portfolio returns from 2019 to 2020. Moreover, we used value-at-risk (VaR) and value-at-risk measurements based on the Cornish-Fisher expansion (CFVaR). The empirical results show significant long- and short-term spillover effects. The two-stage multivariate EGARCH model's results show that the conditional volatilities of both asset portfolios surge more after positive news and respond well to previous shocks. As a result, financial assets have low unconditional volatility and the lowest risk when there are no external interruptions.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究考察了加密货币回报波动性、全球股市指数以及COVID-19疫情的相关性，并分析了其传播效应。为此，我们采用了一种两阶段多元波动性指数GARCH（EGARCH）模型，并结合积分动态条件相关（DCC）方法，从2019年到2020年度测度了金融投资组合回报的影响。此外，我们使用了基于Cornish-Fisher扩展（CFVaR）的风险价值（VaR）和条件风险价值（VaR）。实证结果显示存在显著的长期和短期传播效应。两阶段多元EGARCH模型的结果表明，在积极消息后资产投资组合的条件波动性增加，并对先前的冲击做出良好的响应。因此，金融资产在没有外部打扰时具有较低的无条件波动性和最低的风险。尽管金融资产对冲击敏感，但在一定程度上对冲击表现出一定的抵抗能力。",
