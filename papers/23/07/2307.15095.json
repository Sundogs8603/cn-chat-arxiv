    "translated_abstract": "AI和认知科学领域的最新进展开辟了以前无法研究的新挑战。其中一项现代任务是通过使用其他模态的数据来恢复丢失的数据模态。人脑的功能中存在一种类似效应（称为麦格尔克效应），其中一种信息模态干扰另一种信息模态，改变其感知。在本文中，我们提出一种模拟这种效应并将其用于使用变分自动编码器、自组织映射和Hebb连接在统一的ReD-SOM（重新进入深度自组织映射）模型中重建丢失的数据模态的方法。我们受到人类大脑在不同模态下使用不同脑区的能力的启发，即在某一模态中缺乏信息的情况下。这种新方法不仅改善了对模糊数据的分析，而且还恢复了预期的信号！在多模态数据集上获得的结果证实了该方法的有效性。",
