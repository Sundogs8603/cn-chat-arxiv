    "abstract": "In recent years, personality has been regarded as a valuable personal factor being incorporated into numerous tasks such as sentiment analysis and product recommendation. This has led to widespread attention to text-based personality recognition task, which aims to identify an individual's personality based on given text. Considering that ChatGPT has recently exhibited remarkable abilities on various natural language processing tasks, we provide a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT on text-based personality recognition task for generating effective personality data. Concretely, we employ a variety of prompting strategies to explore ChatGPT's ability in recognizing personality from given text, especially the level-oriented prompting strategy we designed for guiding ChatGPT in analyzing given text at a specified level. We compare the performance of ChatGPT on two representative real-world datasets with traditional neural network, fine-tuned RoBERTa, and corresponding state-of-the-art task",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人格被视为一种有价值的个人因素，被纳入了许多任务，如情感分析和产品推荐。这导致了对基于文本的人格识别任务的广泛关注，该任务旨在根据给定的文本识别个体的人格。考虑到ChatGPT近期在各种自然语言处理任务中展现出的显著能力，我们对ChatGPT在基于文本的人格识别任务上的表现进行了初步评估，以生成有效的人格数据。具体而言，我们采用了各种提示策略，探索ChatGPT从给定的文本中识别人格的能力，尤其是我们设计的面向层级的提示策略，用于指导ChatGPT在指定层次分析给定的文本。我们将ChatGPT在两个代表性的实际数据集上与传统的神经网络、微调的RoBERTa以及相应的最新任务的性能进行了比较。",
