    "translated_abstract": "在科学和工程中，复杂系统有时会展现出在不同区域之间变化的行为。传统的全局模型很难捕捉到这种复杂行为的全范围，从而限制了它们准确表示系统的能力。为了应对这个挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的竞争学习方法，用于获取基于数据的物理系统模型。所提出方法的主要思想是同时对一组模型进行训练，并采用动态损失函数。每个模型在训练过程中争夺每个观察值，从而允许在数据集中识别出不同的功能区域。为了展示学习方法的有效性，我们将其与使用梯度优化器进行训练的各种回归方法相结合。所提出的方法在涉及模型发现和函数拟合的各种问题上进行了测试，表明它能够成功地识别出功能区域。",
