    "translated_abstract": "现有的目标搜索方法使得机器人可以在自由路径上进行搜索，然而，在非结构化的以人为中心的环境中操作的机器人经常需要操控环境以满足他们的需求。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种新的交互式多目标搜索任务，机器人需要打开门以浏览房间，并在橱柜和抽屉内搜索目标物品。这些新挑战需要在未知环境中结合操控和导航技能。我们提出了HIMOS，一种层次强化学习方法，学习组合探索、导航和操控技能。为了实现这一点，我们设计了一个围绕语义地图记忆的抽象高级动作空间，并利用探索过的环境作为实例导航点。我们在仿真和真实世界中进行了大量实验，证明HIMOS可以零样本方式有效地迁移到新的环境中，并且对于未见过的子任务具有鲁棒性。",

Experimental results demonstrate that this method can effectively transfer to new environments in a zero-shot manner and exhibits robustness to unseen subtasks."
