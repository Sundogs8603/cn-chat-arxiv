    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络（DNNs）容易受到后门攻击的影响，这种攻击并不会影响网络对干净数据的性能，但一旦添加触发模式，就会操纵网络行为。现有的防御方法大大降低了攻击成功率，但它们在干净数据上的预测准确性仍然远远落后于干净模型。受后门攻击的隐蔽性和有效性的启发，我们提出了一个简单但非常有效的防御框架，该框架注入了针对被污染样本的非对抗性后门。按照后门攻击的一般步骤，我们检测一小组可疑样本，然后对它们应用毒化策略。一旦触发，非对抗性后门抑制了攻击者对污染数据的后门攻击，但对干净数据的影响有限。防御可以在数据预处理期间进行，而不需要对标准的端到端训练流程进行任何修改。",
