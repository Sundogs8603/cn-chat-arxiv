In this study, we propose a method named VesselMorph which generalizes the 2D retinal vessel segmentation task by synthesizing a shape-aware representation.

    "translated_abstract": "由于缺乏统一的成像协议，来自不同站点的数据之间的领域转移是医学图像的固有属性，已经成为学习算法大规模应用的主要障碍。对于视网膜血管图像，领域转移通常表现为强度、对比度和分辨率的变化，而血管的基本管状形状保持不变。因此，利用这种领域不变的形态学特征可以大大提高深度模型的通用性。在本研究中，我们提出了一种名为VesselMorph的方法，通过合成形状感知表征来推广2D视网膜血管分割任务。受传统Frangi滤波器和扩散张量成像文献的启发，我们引入了一种基于Hessian的双极张量场来描述血管的形态学特征，从而考虑到形状信息。我们将强度图像和张量场映射到潜在空间中。",
