    "translated_abstract": "深度对冲是一个基于深度学习的衍生品对冲框架，用于不完全市场中的对冲。深度对冲的优势在于其能够处理各种现实市场条件，如市场摩擦，而这在传统的数学金融框架中很难解决。由于深度对冲依赖于市场模拟，因此底层资产价格过程模型至关重要。然而，现有的关于深度对冲的文献往往依赖于传统的数学金融模型，例如布朗运动和随机波动模型，而寻找有效的底层资产模型用于深度对冲学习一直是一个挑战。在本研究中，我们提出了一个新的框架，称为对抗式深度对冲，受到对抗性学习的启发。在这个框架中，一个对冲者和一个生成器分别对底层资产过程和底层资产过程进行建模，并以对抗性的方式进行训练。所提出的方法能够学习一个稳健的对冲者，而无需进行价格过程建模。",
