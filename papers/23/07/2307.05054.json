    "abstract": "In an information aggregation game, a set of senders interact with a receiver through a mediator. Each sender observes the state of the world and communicates a message to the mediator, who recommends an action to the receiver based on the messages received. The payoff of the senders and of the receiver depend on both the state of the world and the action selected by the receiver. This setting extends the celebrated cheap talk model in two aspects: there are many senders (as opposed to just one) and there is a mediator. From a practical perspective, this setting captures platforms in which strategic experts advice is aggregated in service of action recommendations to the user. We aim at finding an optimal mediator/platform that maximizes the users' welfare given highly resilient incentive compatibility requirements on the equilibrium selected: we want the platform to be incentive compatible for the receiver/user when selecting the recommended action, and we want it to be resilient agai",

    "translated_abstract": "在信息聚合游戏中，一组发送者通过一个中介与接收者进行互动。每个发送者观察到世界的状态，并向中介传达一个信息，中介根据接收到的信息向接收者推荐一个行动。发送者和接收者的回报取决于世界的状态和接收者选择的行动。这个设置在两个方面扩展了著名的廉价交谈模型：有很多发送者（而不是只有一个）和一个中介。从实践角度来看，这个设置捕捉到了将战略专家的建议在服务行动推荐给用户时进行聚合的平台。我们的目标是找到一个最优的中介/平台，以在选择均衡时最大化用户的福利，并且对于接收者/用户在选择推荐行动时保持高度的激励兼容性要求，并且对于被推荐的行动选择也具有弹性。",

The goal is to find an optimal mediator/platform that maximizes user welfare and is both incentive compatible and resilient in action recommendations."
