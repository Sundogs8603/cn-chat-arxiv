    "abstract": "As an efficient approach to understand, generate, and process natural language texts, research in natural language processing (NLP) has exhibited a rapid spread and wide adoption in recent years. Given the increasing amount of research work in this area, several NLP-related approaches have been surveyed in the research community. However, a comprehensive study that categorizes established topics, identifies trends, and outlines areas for future research remains absent to this day. Contributing to closing this gap, we have systematically classified and analyzed research papers included in the ACL Anthology. As a result, we present a structured overview of the research landscape, provide a taxonomy of fields-of-study in NLP, analyze recent developments in NLP, summarize our findings, and highlight directions for future work.",
