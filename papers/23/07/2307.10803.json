    "translated_abstract": "随着海洋时空数据量的增加，已经进行了大量的空间-时间数据挖掘（STDM）研究来解决各种海洋问题，如气候预测和灾害警示。与典型的ST数据（如交通数据）相比，ST海洋数据更加复杂，具有一些独特的特征，例如多样化的区域性和高稀疏性。这些特点使得设计和训练STDM模型变得困难。不幸的是，还缺乏对这些研究的概述，这阻碍了计算机科学家在海洋领域识别研究问题，同时也使海洋科学研究人员不愿应用先进的STDM技术。为了解决这个问题，我们提供了一份综合调查，总结了海洋领域中现有的STDM研究。具体而言，我们首先总结了广泛使用的ST海洋数据集并确定了它们的独特特点。然后，讨论了典型的ST海洋数据质量增强技术。接下来，我们对现有的STDM进行分类。",
