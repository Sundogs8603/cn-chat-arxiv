    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种自学习算法，针对稀疏传感器信息的封闭环气缸尾流控制，以降低阻力和减小升力的波动。该方法采用深度强化学习作为起始点，并通过将传感器信号提取为动态特征（DF）来显著提高DRL性能，从而预测未来的流动状态。由此得到的基于动态特征的深度强化学习（DF-DRL）在没有动态模型的情况下自动学习了一个在系统中的反馈控制。结果表明，相比直接传感器反馈的基准模型，DF-DRL模型的阻力系数减小了25%。更重要的是，仅使用一个表面压力传感器，DF-DRL可以将阻力系数降低到Re = 100时约8%的最先进性能，并且显著减轻了升力系数的波动。因此，DF-DRL允许在不降低控制性能的情况下部署稀疏传感器对流动进行感知。此方法还展示了良好的鲁棒性。",
