As AD impairs the patient's language understanding and expression ability, the speech of AD patients can serve as an indicator of this disease. This study investigates various methods for detecting AD using patients' speech and transcripts data from the DementiaBank Pitt database. The proposed approach involves pre-trained language models and Graph Neural Network (GNN) that constructs a graph from the speech transcript, and extracts features using GNN for AD detection. Data augmentation techniques, including synonym replacement, GPT-based augmenter, and so on, were used to address the small dataset size. Audio data was also introduced, and WavLM model was used to extract audio features. These features were then fused with text features using various methods. Finally, a contrastive learning approach was attempted by converting speech transcripts back to audio and using it for contrastive learning",

    "translated_abstract": "阿尔茨海默病（AD）是一种常见的严重影响患者健康的痴呆症。由于AD会影响患者的语言理解和表达能力，患者的语音可以作为指示该疾病的指标。本研究使用来自DementiaBank Pitt数据库的患者语音和转录数据，探索了各种方法来检测AD。所提出的方法包括使用预训练语言模型和图神经网络（GNN）从语音转录构建图，并使用GNN提取特征用于AD检测。采用了数据增强技术，包括同义词替换、基于GPT的增强器等，以解决数据集大小较小的问题。还引入了音频数据，并使用WavLM模型提取音频特征。然后使用各种方法将这些特征与文本特征融合。最后，尝试了一种对比学习方法，通过将语音转录回音频并将其用于对比学习。",
