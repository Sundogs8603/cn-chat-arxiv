    "translated_abstract": "理解劳动力市场动态需要准确地识别劳动力所需的技能。越来越多的自动化技术被开发出来支持这个工作。然而，由于现有技能的数量庞大，从职位发布中自动提取技能是具有挑战性的。ESCO（欧洲技能、能力、资格和职业）框架提供了一个有用的参考，列出了超过13,000个独立的技能。然而，技能提取仍然困难，并且准确地将工作岗位与ESCO分类进行匹配是一个悬而未决的问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的零-shot技能提取系统。我们生成ESCO技能的合成训练数据，并训练一个分类器从职位发布中提取技能提及。我们还使用相似性检索器生成技能候选项，然后使用第二个LLM进行重新排序。使用合成数据实现了技能提取的良好效果。",
