    "translated_abstract": "强化学习在需要学习在反馈有限的环境中行动的多个应用中取得了成功。然而，尽管有这种经验上的成功，仍然没有对强化学习模型的参数和用于表示状态的特征如何相互作用控制学习动态的理论理解。在这项工作中，我们使用统计物理学的概念，研究线性函数逼近器下时间差分学习价值函数的典型学习曲线。我们的理论是在一个高斯等效假设下推导出来的，其中对随机轨迹的平均值被替换为时态相关的高斯特征平均值，并且我们在小规模马尔可夫决策过程上验证了我们的假设。我们发现，由于对可能的轨迹空间进行子采样而产生的随机半梯度噪声导致值误差出现显著的平台，这与传统的梯度下降不同。",
