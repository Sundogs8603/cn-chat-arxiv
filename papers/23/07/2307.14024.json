    "translated_abstract": "会话推荐系统旨在通过交互式获取用户偏好，相应地向用户推荐物品。准确学习动态用户偏好对于会话推荐系统至关重要。先前的研究通过交互对话和物品知识中的两两关系来学习用户偏好，但往往忽视了在会话推荐系统中关系的复合性。具体而言，用户喜欢/不喜欢满足某些属性的物品（喜欢/不喜欢视图）。此外，社交影响是影响用户对物品的偏好的另一个重要因素（社交视图），但是先前的会话推荐系统往往忽略了这一因素。这三个视图的用户偏好本质上是不同的，但整体上是相关的。相同视图的用户偏好应该比不同视图的用户偏好更相似。喜欢视图的用户偏好应该与社交视图相似，但与不喜欢视图不同。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文提出了一种多视图超图对比策略学习的方法，用于会话推荐系统。该方法综合考虑了用户的喜欢、社交和不喜欢三个视图，并通过对比学习用户偏好，从而提高会话推荐的准确性。"
