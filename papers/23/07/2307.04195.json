    "translated_abstract": "机器人的引入被广泛认为有望解决施工行业面临的劳动力短缺和生产力停滞的问题。然而，在复杂和无结构的施工现场使用完全自动化的机器人是具有挑战性的。人机协作在施工中显示出了结合人类工人的灵活性和机器人助手的物理能力共同应对施工工作中固有不确定性的潜力。在引入人机协作时，识别团队合作和监督在实地施工中的重要性，并为人类工人和机器人助手建立一种自然直观的交流系统至关重要。基于自然语言的交互可以使非机器人编程专家的人类工人与机器人之间进行直观和熟悉的交流。然而，目前在建筑领域对这一主题的研究还很有限。本文提出了一个框架来允许实现这种直观的交流。",
