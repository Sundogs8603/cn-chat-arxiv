The running time of the algorithm matches that of newly introduced interior point algorithms for regret minimization: in $n$-dimensional space, during each iteration the new algorithm essentially solves a system of linear equations of order $n$, rather than solving some constrained convex optimization problem in $n$ dimensions and possibly many constraints.",
