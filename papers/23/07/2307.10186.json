    "translated_abstract": "高光谱图像在各个领域具有重要的应用，因为它们在光谱波段中注册了大量的语义和空间信息，并且具有光谱特征的空间可变性。在识别高光谱图像的像素中存在两个关键挑战，分别是表示局部和全局之间相关信息以及模型丰富参数。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种多尺度U形多层感知器(MUMLP)模型，它由设计的MSC(Multi-Scale Channel)块和UMLP(U形多层感知器)结构组成。MSC将通道维度转换和混合光谱波段特征以嵌入适当的深层表示。UMLP由编码器-解码器结构和多层感知器层设计而成，能够压缩大规模参数。我们进行了大量实验来证明我们的模型在性能上优于现有方法。",
