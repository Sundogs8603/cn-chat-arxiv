    "translated_abstract": "在许多现实场景中，模糊的目标给机器人技术带来了长期的挑战，因为很难定义规则、奖励或约束以进行优化。像整理一张凌乱的桌子这样的任务对人类来说可能很简单，但由于常识推理的歧义和灵活性，表达整洁的标准却很复杂。近年来，在大规模语言模型（LLM）的进一步发展中，我们有了通过这些模糊目标进行推理的机会：LLM通过学习大量人类数据来捕捉有关人类行为的有意义的常识。然而，由于LLM仅训练于语言输入，它们在感知和低级控制方面的能力有限，因此可能在机器人任务中遇到困难。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种简单的方法来解决整理桌子的任务，这是一个具有模糊目标的机器人任务的示例。具体而言，整理一张桌子的任务不仅涉及按照类型和功能对物体进行聚类以实现语义整洁，还需要考虑感知和低级控制方面的因素。",
