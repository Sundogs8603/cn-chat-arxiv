    "translated_abstract": "在X射线计算机断层扫描（CT）中，需从多个角度获取投影，并用于三维重建。为了使CT适用于在线质量控制，需要减少角度数目同时保持重建质量。稀疏角度断层扫描是从有限数据获取三维重建的常用方法。为了优化其性能，可以按序适应扫描角度，选择每个扫描对象最有信息量的角度。数学上，这对应于解决一个最优实验设计（OED）问题。OED问题是高维、非凸、双层优化问题，无法在线解决，即无法在扫描过程中解决。为了解决这些挑战，我们将OED问题在贝叶斯框架中建模为一个部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程，并通过深度强化学习来求解。该方法通过大量离线训练学习高效的非贪婪策略来解决给定类别的OED问题。",
