    "translated_abstract": "外推对于许多统计学和机器学习应用至关重要，因为常常会遇到超出训练样本范围的测试数据。然而，对于非线性模型来说，外推是一个巨大的挑战。传统模型在这方面通常遇到困难：树集成模型在支持范围外提供连续的预测，而神经网络的预测往往变得不可控。这项工作旨在提供一种非线性回归方法，其可靠性在训练样本范围边界不会立即崩溃。我们的主要贡献是一种名为“engression”的新方法，它是一种预加性噪声模型的分布回归技术，其中噪声添加到协变量上并应用非线性转换。我们的实验结果表明，该模型通常适用于许多真实数据集。我们展示engression可以在一些假设下成功进行外推，例如严格限制噪声大小。",
