We show that acceptance sets induce comonotonic additive risk measures if and only if the acceptance sets and their complements are stable under convex combinations of comonotonic random variables. A generalization of this result applies to risk measures that are additive for random variables with \\textit{a priori} specified dependence structures, e.g., perfectly correlated, uncorrelated, or independent random variables.",
