    "abstract": "The problem of function approximation by neural dynamical systems has typically been approached in a top-down manner: Any continuous function can be approximated to an arbitrary accuracy by a sufficiently complex model with a given architecture. This can lead to high-complexity controls which are impractical in applications. In this paper, we take the opposite, constructive approach: We impose various structural restrictions on system dynamics and consequently characterize the class of functions that can be realized by such a system. The systems are implemented as a cascade interconnection of a neural stochastic differential equation (Neural SDE), a deterministic dynamical system, and a readout map. Both probabilistic and geometric (Lie-theoretic) methods are used to characterize the classes of functions realized by such systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "通过神经动力系统进行函数逼近的问题通常采用自上而下的方法：用给定结构的复杂模型可以将任何连续函数逼近到任意精度。然而，这可能导致在应用中不实际的高复杂度控制。本文采用相反的构造性方法：我们对系统动力学施加各种结构限制，从而刻画了可以通过这种系统实现的函数类。系统实现为神经随机微分方程（Neural SDE）、确定性动力系统和一个输出映射的级联连接。采用概率和几何（李论）方法来刻画这些系统实现的函数类。",

The approach involves a cascade interconnection of a neural stochastic differential equation (Neural SDE), a deterministic dynamical system, and a readout map. The results contribute to improving the practical feasibility of function approximation algorithms."
