    "abstract": "Source-free domain adaptation has become popular because of its practical usefulness and no need to access source data. However, the adaptation process still takes a considerable amount of time and is predominantly based on optimization that relies on back-propagation. In this work we present a simple feed-forward approach that challenges the need for back-propagation based adaptation. Our approach is based on computing prototypes of classes under the domain shift using a pre-trained model. It achieves strong improvements in accuracy compared to the pre-trained model and requires only a small fraction of time of existing domain adaptation methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "在没有访问源数据的情况下，源无关域适应因其实用性和无需访问源数据而变得流行。然而，适应过程仍然需要相当长的时间，并且主要基于依赖于反向传播的优化。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种简单的前馈方法，挑战了基于反向传播的适应的必要性。我们的方法基于使用预训练模型计算出的类在域偏移下的原型。与预训练模型相比，它在精度上取得了强大的改进，并且只需要现有域适应方法所需时间的一小部分。",
