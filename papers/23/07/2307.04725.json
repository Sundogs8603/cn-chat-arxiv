    "translated_abstract": "随着文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型（如稳定扩散）和相应的个性化技术（如DreamBooth和LoRA）的推动，每个人都能以合理的成本将他们的想象力展现为高质量的图像。然而，将运动动态添加到现有高质量个性化T2I并使其生成动画仍然是一个公开的挑战。在本文中，我们提出了AnimateDiff，这是一个实用的框架，可以动画化个性化的T2I模型而无需特定的调整。我们框架的核心是一个即插即用的运动模块，只需进行一次训练，即可无缝地集成到来自相同基础T2I的任何个性化T2I中。通过我们提出的训练策略，运动模块可以有效地从现实世界的视频中学习可转移的运动先验。一旦训练完成，该运动模块可以插入到个性化T2I模型中，形成一个个性化的动画生成器。我们进一步提出了MotionLoRA，一种轻量级的...（摘要未完成）",
