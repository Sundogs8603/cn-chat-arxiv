    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a dynamic grouping negotiation model for climate mitigation based on real-world business and political negotiation protocols. Within the AI4GCC competition framework, we develop a three-stage process: group formation and updates, intra-group negotiation, and inter-group negotiation. Our model promotes efficient and effective cooperation between various stakeholders to achieve global climate change objectives. By implementing a group-forming method and group updating strategy, we address the complexities and imbalances in multi-region climate negotiations. Intra-group negotiations ensure that all members contribute to mitigation efforts, while inter-group negotiations use the proposal-evaluation framework to set mitigation and savings rates. We demonstrate our negotiation model within the RICE-N framework, illustrating a promising approach for facilitating international cooperation on climate change mitigation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个基于现实世界业务和政治谈判协议的气候减缓动态分组谈判模型。在AI4GCC竞赛框架下，我们开发了一个三阶段流程：组形成和更新、组内谈判和组间谈判。我们的模型促进各利益相关方之间的高效合作，以实现全球气候变化目标。通过实施组形成方法和组更新策略，我们解决了多地区气候谈判中的复杂性和不平衡问题。组内谈判确保所有成员都为减缓努力做出贡献，而组间谈判则使用提案评估框架来制定减缓和节约率。我们在RICE-N框架中展示了我们的谈判模型，展示了一个有前景的促进国际合作应对气候变化减缓的方法。",
