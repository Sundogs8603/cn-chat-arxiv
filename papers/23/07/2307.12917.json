    "translated_abstract": "随着深度传感器和深度学习的快速发展，基于骨架的人物重新识别模型近年来取得了显著进展，并具有许多优势。然而，大多数现有方法仅从身体关节学习单层次的骨架特征，并假设骨架的重要性相等，因此通常无法利用更多来自不同层次（如肢体层次）的信息丰富的骨架特征。此外，这些方法的标签依赖性也限制了它们在学习更一般的骨架表示方面的灵活性。本文提出了一种通用的无监督层次骨架元-原型对比学习（Hi-MPC）方法，结合硬骨架挖掘（HSM）用于无标签3D骨架的人物重新识别。首先，我们构建了骨架的层次表示，以模拟身体关节、组件和肢体层次的粗到细的身体和动作特征。然后，我们使用层次化的元-原型对比学习方法进行特征提取和聚类。",
