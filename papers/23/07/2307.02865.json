    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel tag-based recommender system called PLIERS, which relies on the assumption that users are mainly interested in items and tags with similar popularity to those they already own. PLIERS is aimed at reaching a good tradeoff between algorithmic complexity and the level of personalization of recommended items. To evaluate PLIERS, we performed a set of experiments on real OSN datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of personalization, relevance, and novelty of recommendations.",
