    "abstract": "The increasing use of data in various parts of the economic and social systems is creating a new form of monopoly: data monopolies. We illustrate that the companies using these strategies, Datalists, are challenging the existing definitions used within Monopoly Capital Theory (MCT). Datalists are pursuing a different type of monopoly control than traditional multinational corporations. They are pursuing monopolistic control over data to feed their productive processes, increasingly controlled by algorithms and Artificial Intelligence (AI). These productive processes use information about humans and the creative outputs of humans as the inputs but do not classify those humans as employees, so they are not paid or credited for their labour. This paper provides an overview of this evolution and its impact on monopoly theory. It concludes with an outline for a research agenda for economics in this space.",

    "translated_abstract": "数据在经济和社会系统的各个方面的增加使用正在创造一种新形式的垄断：数据垄断。我们阐明了采用这些策略的公司，数据主义者，正在挑战垄断资本理论（MCT）中使用的现有定义。数据主义者正在追求一种不同类型的垄断控制，而不是传统的跨国公司。他们正在追求对数据的垄断控制，以供给他们的算法和人工智能（AI）控制的生产过程使用。这些生产过程使用关于人类和人类创造的产出的信息作为输入，但不将这些人类分类为雇员，因此他们的劳动没有得到支付或认可。本文概述了这一发展及其对垄断理论的影响，并以该领域的经济学研究议程为结论。",
