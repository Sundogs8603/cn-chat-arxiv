    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and categorizing people's emotions or opinions regarding various topics. The analysis of Twitter sentiment has become an increasingly popular topic in recent years. In this paper, we present several machine learning and a deep learning model to analysis sentiment of Persian political tweets. Our analysis was conducted using Bag of Words and ParsBERT for word representation. We applied Gaussian Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, as well as a combination of CNN and LSTM to classify the polarities of tweets. The results of this study indicate that deep learning with ParsBERT embedding performs better than machine learning. The CNN-LSTM model had the highest classification accuracy with 89 percent on the first dataset with three classes and 71 percent on the second dataset with seven classes. Due to the complexity of Persian, it was a difficult task to achieve this level of efficiency.",

    "translated_abstract": "情感分析是识别和分类人们对各种话题的情感或观点的过程。近年来，对Twitter情感的分析成为一个越来越受欢迎的话题。在本文中，我们提出了几种机器学习和深度学习模型，用于分析波斯政治推特的情感。我们使用词袋模型和ParsBERT进行词汇表示的分析。我们应用了高斯朴素贝叶斯、梯度提升、逻辑回归、决策树、随机森林以及CNN和LSTM的组合来分类推特的极性。本研究的结果表明，使用ParsBERT嵌入的深度学习模型比机器学习表现更好。CNN-LSTM模型在第一个有三种类别的数据集上的分类准确率为89％，在第二个有七种类别的数据集上的分类准确率为71％。由于波斯语的复杂性，达到这一效率水平是一项困难的任务。",
