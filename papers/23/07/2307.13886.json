    "abstract": "The current framework for climate change negotiation models presents several limitations that warrant further research and development. In this track, we discuss mainly two key areas for improvement, focusing on the geographical impacts and utility framework. In the aspects of geographical impacts, We explore five critical aspects: (1) the shift from local to global impact, (2) variability in climate change effects across regions, (3) heterogeneity in geographical location and political structures, and (4) collaborations between adjacent nations, (5) the importance of including historical and cultural factors influencing climate negotiations. Furthermore, we emphasize the need to refine the utility and rewards framework to reduce the homogeneity and the level of overestimating the climate mitigation by integrating the positive effects of saving rates into the reward function and heterogeneity among all regions. By addressing these limitations, we hope to enhance the accuracy and effect",

    "translated_abstract": "当前的气候变化谈判模型存在一些限制，需要进一步研究和发展。在这个方向上，我们主要讨论了两个关键改进领域，重点放在地理影响和效用框架上。在地理影响方面，我们探讨了五个关键方面：（1）从局部到全球影响的转变，（2）不同地区气候变化效应的变异性，（3）地理位置和政治结构的异质性，（4）相邻国家之间的合作，（5）包括历史和文化因素对气候谈判的影响的重要性。此外，我们强调了需要完善效用和奖励框架，减少一致性和高估气候缓解程度的问题，将储蓄率的正面效应纳入奖励函数，并考虑所有地区的异质性。通过解决这些限制，我们希望提高准确性和效果。",
