    "abstract": "A simple graph on $n$ vertices may contain a lot of maximum cliques. But how many can it potentially contain? We will show that the maximum number of maximum cliques is taken over so-called cliqueful graphs, more specifically, later we will show that it is taken over saturated composite cliqueful graphs, if $n \\ge 15$. Using this we will show that the graph that contains $3^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor}c$ maxcliques has the most number of maxcliques on $n$ vertices, where $c\\in\\{1,\\frac{4}{3},2\\}$, depending on $n \\text{ mod } 3$.",

    "translated_abstract": "一个简单图在n个顶点上可能包含许多最大团。但它可能包含多少个呢？我们将展示最大团的最大数量取决于所谓的充满团图，具体地说，如果n≥15，我们将展示它取决于饱和复合充满团图。利用这一点，我们将展示包含3^{⌊n/3⌋}c个最大团的图在n个顶点上具有最多的最大团数量，其中c∈{1,4/3,2}，取决于n模3的值。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper examines the concept of cliqueful graphs and discovers that the maximum number of maximum cliques in a simple graph depends on saturated composite cliqueful graphs. By calculating specifically, we obtain an explicit expression for the graph with the most number of maximum cliques on n vertices."
