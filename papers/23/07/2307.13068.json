    "abstract": "Frequent pattern mining is a relevant method to analyse structured data, like sequences, trees or graphs. It consists in identifying characteristic substructures of a dataset. This paper deals with a new type of patterns for tree data: common subtrees with identical label distribution. Their detection is far from obvious since the underlying isomorphism problem is graph isomorphism complete. An elaborated search algorithm is developed and analysed from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. Based on this, the enumeration of patterns is performed through a new lossless compression scheme for trees, called DAG-RW, whose complexity is investigated as well. The method shows very good properties, both in terms of computation times and analysis of real datasets from the literature. Compared to other substructures like topological subtrees and labelled subtrees for which the isomorphism problem is linear, the patterns found provide a more parsimonious representation of the data.",

    "translated_abstract": "频繁模式挖掘是一种分析结构化数据的相关方法，如序列，树或图。它的目的是识别数据集的特征子结构。本文针对树状数据的一种新类型的模式进行了探讨：具有相同标签分布的常见子树。由于基础同构问题是图同构完全问题，因此其检测远非明显。我们开发了一种精心设计的搜索算法，并从理论和数值角度进行了分析。基于此，通过一种名为DAG-RW的新的树形无损压缩方案来执行模式的枚举，其复杂性也得到了研究。该方法在计算时间和对文献中的实际数据集的分析方面都表现出非常好的性能。与其他子结构（如拓扑子树和标记子树）相比，其同构问题是线性的，所发现的模式提供了数据的更节约表示。",
