    "translated_abstract": "随着医学图像分析的研究兴趣越来越细致，广泛标注的成本也在上升。为了减少成本，一种可行的方法是用粗粒度的超类标签进行标注，同时使用有限的精细标注作为补充。通过这种方式，充足的粗粒度注释辅助了精细数据学习。最近的分类任务研究在采用这种方法以取得令人满意的结果。然而，在语义分割任务中，对于高效学习细粒度子类的研究还不足。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，利用类别的层次结构来设计网络架构。同时，提出了一种任务驱动的数据生成方法，使得网络更容易识别不同的子类别。具体而言，我们引入了一个前向连接模块，通过连接来自超类预测结果的标签，增强了子类分割的置信度。",
