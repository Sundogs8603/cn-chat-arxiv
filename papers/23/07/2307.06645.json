    "translated_abstract": "预测移动网络中实时流量（例如VoIP）的行为，可以帮助运营商更好地规划网络基础设施并优化资源分配。因此，本研究提出了对VoIP流量在实际移动环境中关键QoS/QoE描述符进行预测分析（其中一些在技术文献中被忽略）。该问题以多变量时间序列分析的形式进行建模，这种形式化可以发现和建模各种描述符之间的时间关系，并预测它们在未来时期的行为。通过将多变量时间序列问题转化为监督学习问题，采用向量自回归模型和机器学习（基于深度学习和基于树的方法）进行性能和时间复杂度的比较。此外，还进行了一系列辅助分析（平稳性，正交脉冲响应等）可以发现VoIP流量的特性。",
