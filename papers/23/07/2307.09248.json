When wind power is integrated into the power grid, precise forecasting is necessary for the sustainability and security of the system. However, the unpredictable nature and long sequence prediction make it especially challenging. In this technical report, we introduce the BERT model applied for Baidu KDD Cup 2022, and the daily fluctuation is added by post-processing to make the predicted results in line with daily periodicity.
