    "translated_abstract": "生成对抗网络（GAN）已经成为一种强大的人工智能工具，可以根据训练数据生成逼真的输出。然而，控制 GAN 生成过程的挑战仍然存在。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法来解决这个问题，通过将强化学习（RL）代理与潜在空间 GAN（l-GAN）集成在一起，从而促进生成所需的输出。具体来说，我们开发了一个带有精心设计的奖励策略的 actor-critic RL 代理，使其能够熟练地在 l-GAN 的潜在空间中导航，并根据指定的任务生成输出。为了验证我们的方法的效果，我们进行了一系列实验，使用 MNIST 数据集，包括算术加法作为一个说明性任务。这些实验的结果验证了我们的方法的有效性。我们首次将 RL 代理与 GAN 模型集成起来，代表了一种创新",
