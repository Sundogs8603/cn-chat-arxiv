    "translated_abstract": "现有的半监督目标检测方法假设训练数据和未标记数据集中有一组固定的类别，即属于分布内（ID）的数据。然而，当这些方法在开放世界中应用时，性能显著下降，因为未标记和测试数据可能包含训练过程中未见过的对象，即属于分布外（OOD）的数据。本文探讨两个关键问题：我们是否能够检测这些OOD样本，如果可以，我们是否能够从中学习？考虑到这些问题，我们提出了一种有效的开放世界半监督检测框架（OWSSD），其能够有效地检测OOD数据，并通过半监督学习从ID和OOD数据中进行学习。我们引入了一个基于集成的OOD检测器，由仅在ID数据上训练的轻量级自编码器网络组成。通过广泛的评估，我们证明了我们的方法在OOD目标检测方面与最先进的方法竞争力相当。",
