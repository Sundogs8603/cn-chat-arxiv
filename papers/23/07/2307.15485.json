    "translated_abstract": "在多智能体规划中，使用动态认知逻辑（DEL）已经导致了一个广泛采用的行动形式体系，可以处理非确定性、部分可观测性和任意知识嵌套。然而，这种表达能力的提高是以不可决定性为代价的，因此已经提取出了几种可决定的片段，主要基于行动形式体系的句法限制。本文中，我们采用了一种新颖的语义方法来实现可决定性。具体而言，我们在认知规划的逻辑中增加了一个称为“知识可交换性”的交互公理，该公理控制了代理人在其他代理人的知识上无限推理的能力，而不是强加句法约束。然后，我们提供了三个贡献。首先，我们展示了得到的认知规划问题是可决定的。在这样做的过程中，我们证明了我们的框架具有有限的非不动点特征。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a semantic approach to solve the decidability problem in epistemic planning by introducing an interaction axiom to control the unbounded reasoning ability of agents on the knowledge of other agents, instead of imposing syntactic constraints. The experiments confirm the feasibility of this method and provide a finitary non-fixpoint characterization of the problem."
