    "translated_abstract": "通过将用户的互动视为用户-项目图，图学习模型已广泛应用于基于协同过滤的推荐系统。最近，研究人员将图对比学习技术引入协同过滤中，以缓解稀疏监督问题，首先通过数据增强构建对比视图，然后通过最大化对比视图之间的互信息提供自监督信号。尽管有效，我们认为当前基于图对比学习的推荐系统仍存在局限性，当前的数据增强技术，无论是结构增强还是特征增强。首先，结构增强随机丢弃节点或边，很容易破坏用户-项目图的内在特性。其次，特征增强对每个节点施加相同规模的噪声增强，忽视了图上节点的独特特征。为了解决上述限制，我们提出了一种新颖的变分生成对比图学习模型（Variational Gr）",
