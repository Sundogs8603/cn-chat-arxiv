    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究已经证明了将决策制定视为离线收集的轨迹的监督学习问题的有效性。然而，在轨迹数据上进行序列建模的好处尚不清楚。在这项工作中，我们研究了序列建模是否具备将轨迹压缩为有用表示并对策略学习有所贡献的能力。为了实现这一目标，我们采用了一个两阶段的框架，首先使用序列建模技术总结轨迹，然后利用这些表示学习策略以及一个期望的目标。这个设计使得许多现有的监督式离线强化学习方法可以被看作是我们框架的特例。在这个框架内，我们引入了目标条件预测编码（GCPC），这是一种带来强大轨迹表示并导致高性能策略的方法。我们在AntMaze，FrankaKitchen和Locomotion环境上进行了广泛的实证评估，并观察到...",
