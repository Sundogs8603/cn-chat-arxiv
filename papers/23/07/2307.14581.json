    "translated_abstract": "对于临床应用来说，对于深度学习模型的可解释性尤为重要，因为自动系统的决策具有深远影响。虽然已经存在各种后期解释方法，例如注意力可视化和显著性图，适用于常见的数据模态，包括自然语言和图像，但在流式细胞术（FCM）数据这一模态上的工作尚少。在这项工作中，我们评估了一种称为ReluFormer的transformer架构的使用，该架构可以简化注意力可视化，并提出了一种针对FCM量身定制的基于梯度和注意力的可视化技术。我们对儿童急性淋巴白血病（ALL）FCM样本的细胞分类和多边形回归进行了定性评估。结果展示了模型的决策过程，并演示了如何利用所提出的技术来检查训练后的模型。基于梯度的可视化不仅可以标识细胞.",
