    "translated_abstract": "当使用标准损失函数训练分割网络时，网络并没有明确被要求学习图像的全局不变性，如对象的形状和多个对象之间的几何关系。然而，将这些不变性纳入网络训练中可能有助于改善各种分割任务的性能，尤其是当它们是需要分割的对象的固有特性时。本文以计算机断层扫描（CT）图像中主动脉和大血管的分割为例，这些血管由于人体解剖学，通常在身体中以特定的几何形状出现，并在2D CT图像上主要呈现为圆形对象。本文通过引入一种新的拓扑感知损失函数，通过持久同调惩罚地面真实值和预测之间的拓扑差异来解决这个问题。这与先前提出的分割网络设计不同，先前的设计是将阈值滤波应用于预测图像的似然函数。",
