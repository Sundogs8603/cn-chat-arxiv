    "translated_abstract": "现代社会花费了大量时间在数字交互上，我们的日常行为很多都通过数字手段完成。这导致了许多人工智能工具的出现，帮助我们在生活的各个方面进行辅助。对于数字社会来说，一个关键的工具是推荐系统，它是智能的系统，通过学习我们的过去行为，提出与我们兴趣相符的新行为建议。其中一些系统专门从用户群体的行为中学习，向希望共同完成某个任务的个体群体提出建议。在本文中，我们分析了群体推荐系统的现状，并提出了两种使用新兴的深度学习架构的模型。实验结果表明，与使用四个不同数据集的最新模型相比，采用我们提出的模型可以取得改进。该模型及所有实验的源代码都可供获取。",
