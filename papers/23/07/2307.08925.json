    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLM）在各个领域获得了相当大的关注并找到了多样化的应用，但在真实场景中开发时面临挑战。这些挑战源于公共领域数据可用性的匮乏以及对私有领域数据的隐私保护需求。为了解决这些问题，联邦学习（FL）作为一项有前景的技术出现了，它能够在保持分散数据的同时实现共同训练共享模型。我们提出了联邦式LLM的概念，包括三个关键组成部分，即联邦式LLM预训练、联邦式LLM微调和联邦式LLM提示工程。对于每个组件，我们讨论了它相对于传统LLM训练方法的优势，并提出了具体的工程策略来实施。此外，我们探讨了FL和LLM集成带来的新挑战。我们分析现有的解决方案并确定可能的障碍",
