    "translated_abstract": "基于无人机的智能数据采集用于3D重建和基础设施监测，由于图像处理和深度学习技术的最新进展，正经历着越来越多的兴趣。视图规划是这个任务的重要部分，它决定了信息捕获策略，并且严重影响从捕获的数据生成的3D模型的质量。最近的方法使用先前的知识或目标的部分重建来实现主动重建的视图规划；前一种方法对于复杂或新识别的目标构成了挑战，而后者计算开销很大。在这项工作中，我们提出了视图袋（BoV），这是一种完全基于外观的模型，用于为离线数据集的细化和在线下一个最佳视图（NBV）规划应用分配效用，以实现3D重建的任务。通过这个工作，我们还开发了视图规划工具箱（VPT），",
