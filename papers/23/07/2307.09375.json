    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络（DNNs）在各种软件系统中表现出卓越的性能，但也表现出失控行为，甚至导致不可逆转的灾难。因此，识别基于DNN的软件的失控行为并提高DNN的质量至关重要。测试输入优先级是确保DNN质量的一种最吸引人的方式之一，它根据测试输入的优先级排序，以便在有限的时间和手动标记工作中能够更早地识别出更多的有缺陷的输入。然而，现有的优先级方法在可证明性、效果性和通用性三个方面仍存在局限性。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出了CertPri，一种基于DNN特征空间中的测试输入移动成本角度设计的测试输入优先级技术。CertPri在以下三个关键方面与以前的工作不同：（1）可证明性：它为移动成本提供了形式上的鲁棒性保证；（2）有效性：它利用形式上保证的移动成本",
