    "translated_abstract": "档案在信息和知识保护中起着至关重要的作用，这些数据的指数增长需要高效和自动化的工具来管理和利用档案信息资源。档案应用涉及管理大规模数据，这些数据很难处理和分析。虽然语言模型在不同领域取得了显著进展，但还没有公开可用的面向档案的语言模型。为填补这个空白，我们引入了ArcGPT，据我们所知，这是第一个专门为档案领域量身定制的通用语言模型。为了提高模型在真实档案任务中的性能，ArcGPT在大规模和广泛的档案领域数据上进行了预训练。除ArcGPT外，我们还发布了AMBLE，一个包含四个真实档案任务的基准。在AMBLE上的评估表明，ArcGPT优于现有的最先进模型，在有效档案数据管理方面迈出了重要的一步。最终，ArcGPT旨在更好地服务档案界，助力改善档案数据管理。",
