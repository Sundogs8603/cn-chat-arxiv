    "translated_abstract": "近年来，大型语言模型(Large Language Model，LLM)已经成为各种自然语言处理任务的强大工具。然而，在生成式推荐范式下，它们在推荐系统中的潜力相对未被探索。本文提出了一种创新的基于文本数据的推荐系统方法，利用大型语言模型(LLM)来进行推荐。我们介绍了一种新颖的大型语言模型推荐系统(GenRec)，该系统利用LLM的表达能力直接生成目标推荐项，而不是像传统的判别式推荐系统一样逐个计算每个候选项的排名分数。GenRec利用LLM的理解能力来解释上下文、学习用户偏好并生成相关推荐。我们提出的方法利用大型语言模型中编码的丰富知识来完成推荐任务。我们首先制定了专门的提示，以增强LLM理解推荐任务的能力。",
