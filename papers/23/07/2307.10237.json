    "translated_abstract": "在不受限制和无控制的环境下，如长距离、低分辨率、不同视角、光照、姿态和大气条件下，从图像集中进行人脸识别是具有挑战性的。人脸特征聚合在这类识别系统中起到关键作用，它涉及将模板中的N个特征表示聚合成一个全局表示。现有的传统人脸特征聚合方法要么利用元数据，要么利用高维中间特征表示来估计特征质量进行聚合。然而，对于在远距离和高高度环境下捕获的极低分辨率人脸，生成高质量的元数据或风格信息是不可行的。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一种称为CoNAN的特征分布调节方法来进行模板聚合。具体而言，我们的方法旨在学习一个在输入特征分布信息条件下的上下文向量。",
