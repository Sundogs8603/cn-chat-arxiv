    "abstract": "Contemporary scientific research is a distributed, collaborative endeavor, carried out by teams of researchers, regulatory institutions, funding agencies, commercial partners, and scientific bodies, all interacting with each other and facing different incentives. To maintain scientific rigor, statistical methods should acknowledge this state of affairs. To this end, we study hypothesis testing when there is an agent (e.g., a researcher or a pharmaceutical company) with a private prior about an unknown parameter and a principal (e.g., a policymaker or regulator) who wishes to make decisions based on the parameter value. The agent chooses whether to run a statistical trial based on their private prior and then the result of the trial is used by the principal to reach a decision. We show how the principal can conduct statistical inference that leverages the information that is revealed by an agent's strategic behavior -- their choice to run a trial or not. In particular, we show how the p",

    "translated_abstract": "当代科学研究是一项分布式的、协作的工作，由研究团队、监管机构、资助机构、商业合作伙伴和科学机构组成，彼此互动并面对不同的激励。为了保持科学严谨性，统计方法应该认识到这种情况。为此，我们研究了假设检验的情况，其中有一个代理人（例如研究人员或制药公司）对未知参数拥有私人先验知识，还有一个委托人（如政策制定者或监管机构）希望根据参数值做出决策。代理人根据他们的私人先验选择是否进行统计试验，然后试验的结果由委托人用来做出决策。我们展示了委托人如何进行统计推断，利用代理人的战略行为所透露的信息，也就是他们选择是否进行试验。具体来说，我们展示了如何计算p值，从而综合利用代理人的行为和试验的结果进行推理。",
