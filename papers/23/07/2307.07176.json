    "abstract": "The widespread application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in real-world situations is yet to come to fruition, largely as a result of its failure to satisfy the essential safety demands of such systems. Existing safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) methods, employing cost functions to enhance safety, fail to achieve zero-cost in complex scenarios, including vision-only tasks, even with comprehensive data sampling and training. To address this, we introduce Safe DreamerV3, a novel algorithm that integrates both Lagrangian-based and planning-based methods within a world model. Our methodology represents a significant advancement in SafeRL as the first algorithm to achieve nearly zero-cost in both low-dimensional and vision-only tasks within the Safety-Gymnasium benchmark.

    "translated_abstract": "强化学习在真实世界场景中的广泛应用还没有实现, 这主要是因为其未能满足这些系统的基本安全需求。现有的安全强化学习方法使用成本函数来增强安全性，在复杂场景中，包括仅采用视觉的任务中，即使进行全面的数据采样和训练，也无法实现零成本。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了Safe DreamerV3，这是一种将基于拉格朗日和计划的方法集成到世界模型中的新算法。我们的方法论在SafeRL中代表了一个重要的进步，是第一个在Safety-Gymnasium基准中实现近乎零成本的算法。我们的项目网站可以在以下链接找到：https://sites.google.com/view/safedreamerv3。",
