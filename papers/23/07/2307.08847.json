    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning framework that enables multiple organizations to train a model without sharing their data with a central server. However, it experiences significant performance degradation if the data is non-identically independently distributed (non-IID). This is a problem in medical settings, where variations in the patient population contribute significantly to distribution differences across hospitals. Personalized FL addresses this issue by accounting for site-specific distribution differences. Clustered FL, a Personalized FL variant, was used to address this problem by clustering patients into groups across hospitals and training separate models on each group. However, privacy concerns remained as a challenge as the clustering process requires exchange of patient-level information. This was previously solved by forming clusters using aggregated data, which led to inaccurate groups and performance degradation. In this study, we propose Privacy-preserv",

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是一种机器学习框架，可以使多个组织在不与中央服务器共享数据的情况下训练模型。然而，如果数据是非独立分布的（非IID），其性能会显著下降。在医疗环境中，患者群体的变化会导致医院之间的分布差异。个性化联邦学习通过考虑特定站点的分布差异来解决这个问题。个性化联邦学习的一种变体——聚类联邦学习，通过将患者分成不同的群组在医院之间进行训练。然而，隐私问题仍然是一个挑战，因为聚类过程需要交换患者级别的信息。之前通过使用聚合数据形成群组来解决这个问题，但会导致群组不准确和性能下降。在本研究中，我们提出了一种隐私保护的患者聚类方法",
