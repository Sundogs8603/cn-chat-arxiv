    "translated_abstract": "许多现实世界的博弈存在信息不对称问题：一个玩家只知道自己的收益，而另一个玩家拥有完整的游戏信息。例如安全博弈和对抗式多智能体强化学习等关键领域。信息不对称使得传统的解决方案概念如强势斯塔克贝格均衡（SSE）和鲁棒优化均衡（ROE）失效。我们提出了一种新的解决方案概念，称为VISER（受害者安全，剥削者最佳回应）。VISER使得外部观察者能够预测这类博弈的结果。特别地，在安全应用中，VISER允许受害者更好地自卫，并确定攻击者可使用的最具破坏性的攻击方法。我们表明，每个玩家的VISER策略可以通过线性规划在多项式时间内独立计算。我们还将VISER扩展到马尔可夫博弈的马尔可夫完美对应规则，通过一系列的计算可以高效求解。",
