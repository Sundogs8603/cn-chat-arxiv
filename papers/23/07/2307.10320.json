    "translated_abstract": "研究面临着可重复性危机，许多研究的结果和发现很难甚至不可能复现。机器学习和人工智能研究也面临同样的问题，通常这是因为未发布的数据和/或源代码，以及对机器学习训练条件的敏感性。尽管研究界讨论了不同的解决方案来解决这个问题，比如使用机器学习平台，但机器学习驱动的研究的可重复性水平并没有显著提高。因此，在这篇小型调查中，我们回顾了关于机器学习驱动的研究中可重复性的文献，主要目的有三个：（一）反思各个研究领域中机器学习可重复性的现状，（二）识别这些应用了机器学习的研究领域中存在的可重复性问题和障碍，（三）识别支持机器学习可重复性的可能驱动因素，如工具、实践和干预措施。通过这样做，我们希望做出贡献。",
