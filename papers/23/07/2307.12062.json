    "translated_abstract": "鲁棒强化学习旨在训练能够在环境干扰或对抗攻击下表现良好的策略。现有方法通常假设可能干扰的空间在各个时间步骤保持不变。然而，在许多情况下，给定时间步骤上可能干扰的空间取决于过去的干扰。我们正式引入时间耦合干扰，对现有的鲁棒强化学习方法提出了新的挑战。为了应对这个挑战，我们提出了GRAD，一种新的游戏理论方法，将时间耦合鲁棒强化学习问题视为部分可观察的两人零和游戏。通过在这个游戏中找到一个近似均衡，GRAD确保了代理的对时间耦合干扰的鲁棒性。对各种连续控制任务的实证实验表明，我们提出的方法相比基准方法在标准和时间耦合干扰下具有显著的鲁棒性优势。",
