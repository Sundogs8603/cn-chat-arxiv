    "translated_abstract": "时间序列数据集在科学和工程的众多领域中扮演重要角色，如生物医学、地球观测和网络分析。有关状态空间模型（SSMs）的广泛研究是一个强大的数学工具，它允许对时间序列进行概率性和可解释性的学习。在SSMs中估计模型参数被认为是最复杂的任务之一，先验知识的引入既可以简化解释也可以复杂化推断任务。最近的研究工作试图在一些模型参数中加入图形视角，但存在明显的限制，这项工作解决了这些限制。更一般地说，现有的图模型工具旨在包含静态信息或动态信息，其中静态信息侧重于独立随机变量之间的统计依赖（例如，图形Lasso方法），动态信息侧重于时间序列样本之间的因果关系。",
