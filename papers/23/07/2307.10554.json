    "translated_abstract": "混合精度量化（MQ）可以在模型中实现竞争性的精度-复杂度权衡。传统的基于训练的搜索方法需要耗费时间进行候选训练，以搜索MQ中优化的逐层比特宽度配置。最近，一些无需训练的方法提出了多种MQ代理，并显著提高了搜索效率。然而，这些代理与量化精度之间的相关性仍不明确。为了弥补这一差距，我们首先构建了MQ-Bench-101，其中包含不同的比特配置和量化结果。然后，我们观察到现有的无需训练的代理在MQ-Bench-101上表现出弱相关性。为了高效地寻找优秀的代理，我们通过演化算法开发了一个自动搜索代理的框架用于MQ。具体而言，我们设计了一个包括现有代理的精心设计的搜索空间，并进行演化搜索以发现最佳相关的MQ代理。我们提出了一种多样性提示的方法",
