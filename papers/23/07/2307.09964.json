    "abstract": "Nowadays, AI-based systems have achieved outstanding results and have outperformed humans in different domains. However, the processes of training AI models and inferring from them require high computational resources, which pose a significant challenge in the current energy efficiency societal demand. To cope with this challenge, this research project paper describes the main vision, goals, and expected outcomes of the GAISSA project. The GAISSA project aims at providing data scientists and software engineers tool-supported, architecture-centric methods for the modelling and development of green AI-based systems. Although the project is in an initial stage, we describe the current research results, which illustrate the potential to achieve GAISSA objectives.",
