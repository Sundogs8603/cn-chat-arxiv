    "abstract": "We give a first rigorous characterization of Operational Design Domains (ODDs) for Machine Learning (ML)-based aeronautical products. Unlike in other application sectors (such as self-driving road vehicles) where ODD development is scenario-based, our approach is data-centric: we propose the dimensions along which the parameters that define an ODD can be explicitly captured, together with a categorization of the data that ML-based applications can encounter in operation, whilst identifying their system-level relevance and impact. Specifically, we discuss how those data categories are useful to determine: the requirements necessary to drive the design of ML Models (MLMs); the potential effects on MLMs and higher levels of the system hierarchy; the learning assurance processes that may be needed, and system architectural considerations. We illustrate the underlying concepts with an example of an aircraft flight envelope.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们首次对基于机器学习的航空产品的操作设计领域（ODD）进行了严格的特征化。与其他应用领域（如自动驾驶道路车辆）的ODD开发基于场景不同，我们的方法是基于数据的：我们提出了可以明确捕捉定义ODD的参数的维度，同时对ML-based应用在操作中遇到的数据进行分类，同时确定了它们对系统层面的相关性和影响。具体来说，我们讨论了这些数据类别如何有助于确定：驱动ML模型（MLM）设计所需的要求；对MLM和系统层级的潜在影响；可能需要的学习保证过程和系统架构考虑因素。我们通过飞机飞行包线的示例来说明这些概念。",
