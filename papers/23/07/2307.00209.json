    "translated_abstract": "夸张，即夸大其词，是一种常见的语言现象。夸张检测是理解人类表达的重要部分。已经有几项关于夸张检测的研究，但大多数的研究只关注文本模态。然而，随着社交媒体的发展，人们可以使用各种模态（包括文本、图像、视频等）来表达夸张。在本文中，我们专注于多模态夸张检测。我们从微博（中国的一种社交媒体）创建了一个多模态检测数据集，并对其进行了一些研究。我们将微博的文本和图像视为两种模态，探索了文本和图像在夸张检测中的作用。此外，我们还评估了不同预训练的多模态编码器在这个下游任务上的性能。由于这个数据集是从五个不同的主题构建的，我们还评估了不同领域之间的性能。",
