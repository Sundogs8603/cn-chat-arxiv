    "translated_abstract": "聚类性评估的目标是检查数据集中是否存在聚类结构。作为聚类分析中一个至关重要但常常被忽视的问题，我们在应用任何聚类算法之前都需要进行这样的检验。如果一个数据集不可聚类，则任何后续的聚类分析都不会产生有效结果。尽管它的重要性，但现有研究中的大部分关注数值数据，将对分类数据的聚类性评估问题留给成为一个未解决的问题。在这里，我们介绍了TestCat，一种基于测试的方法来评估分类数据的聚类性，使用解析的p值作为评估指标。TestCat的关键思想是，可聚类的分类数据具有许多强相关的属性对，因此将所有属性对的卡方统计量的和作为p值计算的测试统计量。我们将我们的方法应用于一组基准分类数据集，结果表明TestCat的表现优于现有的其他方法。",
