    "translated_abstract": "现有的多模态情感分析工作利用多模态信息进行预测，但不可避免地受到多模态特征和情感标签之间的虚假相关性的影响。例如，如果数据集中大多数带有蓝色背景的视频都有正面标签，模型将依赖于这样的相关性进行预测，而“蓝色背景”并不是一个与情感相关的特征。为解决这个问题，我们定义了一个通用的去偏多模态情感分析任务，旨在通过减少模型对虚假相关性的依赖，提高多模态情感分析模型的非分布外泛化能力。为此，我们提出了一个基于倒数概率加权（Inverse Probability Weighting，IPW）的通用去偏框架，该框架自适应地为具有更大偏差（即更严重的虚假相关性）的样本分配较小的权重。这个去偏框架的关键在于估计每个样本的偏差，这通过两个步骤实现：1）将鲁棒特征和偏见特征分离出来",
