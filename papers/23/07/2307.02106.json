    "translated_abstract": "随着数据分析的普及，数据隐私保护成为了一个重要的关注点。因此，隐私保护的数据分析机制的发展日益增多。然而，这些方法都是针对特定任务设计的，对于新任务的设计过程繁琐。作为替代方案，可以创建理论上不包含私人信息的合成数据。本文重点讨论隐私保护的数据合成（PPDS）并提供该领域的全面概述、分析和讨论。具体而言，我们提出了一个统一两个主要研究领域，即统计方法和基于深度学习（DL）的方法的总结。在该总结中，我们进一步对统计方法进行了建模和表示的选择，并通过不同的生成模型原则来研究基于DL的方法。为了总结我们的发现，我们提供了全面的参考表，概括了关键要点。",
