    "abstract": "We present a scalable method to produce high quality emphasis for text-to-speech (TTS) that does not require recordings or annotations. Many TTS models include a phoneme duration model. A simple but effective method to achieve emphasized speech consists in increasing the predicted duration of the emphasised word. We show that this is significantly better than spectrogram modification techniques improving naturalness by $7.3\\%$ and correct testers' identification of the emphasized word in a sentence by $40\\%$ on a reference female en-US voice. We show that this technique significantly closes the gap to methods that require explicit recordings. The method proved to be scalable and preferred in all four languages tested (English, Spanish, Italian, German), for different voices and multiple speaking styles.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种可扩展的高质量文本转语音（TTS）的重音生成方法，不需要录音或注释。许多TTS模型包含一个音素持续时间模型。一种简单但有效的方法是增加重音词的预测持续时间来实现重音语音。我们证明这比声谱图修改技术显著好，自然性提高了7.3％，在一个参考美国英语女声中，受试者对句子中重音词的识别正确率提高了40％。我们证明这种方法显著缩小了与需要显式录音的方法之间的差距。该方法在四种不同语言（英语、西班牙语、意大利语、德语）、不同语音和多种语言风格下都被证明是可扩展且首选的。",
