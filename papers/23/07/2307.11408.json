    "translated_abstract": "有限元方法(FEM)是一种用于预测软体机器人行为的强大建模工具。然而，对于非数值计算专家来说，它在控制方面的应用可能会很困难：它需要优化计算以使其实时化。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于学习的方法，以获得紧凑但足够丰富的机械表示。我们的选择基于FEM模型在致动器/效应器空间中提供的非线性顺从数据的精简。我们证明了这个紧凑模型可以通过合理量的数据进行学习，并且在建模方面非常有效，因为我们可以推导出机器人的直接和逆运动学。我们还展示了如何将一些单独学习的模型进行耦合，特别是在由两个软体手指组成的夹爪的例子上。通过比较从完整的FEM模型派生的逆模型和从紧凑学习版本派生的逆模型，还展示了其他结果。",
