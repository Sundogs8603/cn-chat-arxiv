In the scientific literature, there are many charts, each with its stylistic differences. Recently the document understanding community has begun to address the problem of automatic chart understanding, which begins with chart classification. In this paper, we present a survey of the current state-of-the-art techniques for chart classification and discuss the available datasets and their supported chart types. We broadly classify these contributions as traditional approaches based on ML, CNN, and Transformers. Furthermore, we carry out an extensive comparative performance analysis of CNN-based and transformer-based approaches on the recently published CHARTINFO UB-UNITECH PMC dataset for the CHART-Infographics competition at ICPR 2022. The data set includes 15 different chart categories, including 22,923 training i",
