In this study, we follow the pupil learning procedure, which has the features of interpreting, picking, understanding, cramming, and organizing, to derive the pupil learning mechanism (PLM) by which to modify the network structure and weights of 2-layer neural networks (2LNNs). The PLM consists of modules for sequential learning, adaptive learning, perfect learning, and less-overfitted learning. Based upon a copper price forecasting dataset, we conduct an experiment to validate the PLM module design modules, and an experiment to evaluate the performance of PLM. The empirical results indeed approve the PLM module design and show the superiority of the proposed PLM model over the linear regression model and the conventional backpropagation-based 2LNN model.",

    "translated_abstract": "在人工神经网络的研究中，很少涉及梯度消失和过拟合问题。在本研究中，我们遵循瞳孔学习过程，通过解释、选择、理解、背诵和整理等特征，推导出修改两层神经网络（2LNNs）的网络结构和权重的瞳孔学习机制（PLM）。PLM包括顺序学习、自适应学习、完美学习和少过拟合学习等模块。基于一个铜价预测数据集，我们进行了实验证明了PLM模块设计的有效性，并评估了PLM的性能。实证结果确实证实了PLM模块设计的优越性，并显示出所提出的PLM模型相对于线性回归模型和基于传统反向传播的2LNN模型的优势。",
