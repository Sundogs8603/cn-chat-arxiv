    "translated_abstract": "数字双生技术被预计将改变医疗保健，实现个性化药物和支持、早期诊断、模拟治疗结果和优化手术计划。数字双生技术在制造业、供应链物流和民用基础设施等行业已经获得了广泛关注，但在患者护理领域尚未得到应用。建模复杂疾病与多模态患者数据以及计算分析的复杂性是制约生物医学领域数字双生技术应用的重要障碍。然而，通过不同方法来处理这些模型可能能够解决这些障碍。本文提出了一个新框架，以解决由计算成本和建模复杂性造成的临床双生模型的障碍。我们提出将患者健康数据构建为知识图谱，并使用闭式连续时间液体神经网络进行实时分析。通过综合多模态患者数据并利用这一框架，可以实现患者护理的数字双生模型的应用。",
