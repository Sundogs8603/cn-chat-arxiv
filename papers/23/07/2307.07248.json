In this paper we study how the GSEMO algorithm with additional diversity-enhancing heuristic optimizes a diversity of its population on a bi-objective benchmark problem OneMinMax, for which all solutions are Pareto-optimal.  We provide a rigorous runtime analysis of the last step of the optimization, when the algorithm starts with a population with a second-best diversity, and prove that it finds a population with optimal diversity in expected time $O(n^2)$, when the problem size $n$ is odd. For reaching our goal, we analyse the random walk of the population, which reflects the frequency of changes in the population and their outcomes.",

    "translated_abstract": "进化多样性优化旨在寻找满足其适应度约束的多样性解集。在多目标优化的上下文中，该约束可能要求解决方案为帕累托最优解。本文研究了GSEMO算法在一个双目标基准问题OneMinMax上如何通过增强多样性的启发式优化其种群的多样性。我们对优化的最后一步进行了严格的运行时分析，即算法从具有次优多样性的种群开始，并证明在问题规模$n$为奇数时，它以期望时间$O(n^2)$找到具有最佳多样性的种群。为了达到我们的目标，我们分析了种群的随机游走，这反映了种群中变化的频率及其结果。",
