    "translated_abstract": "多智能体路径规划（MAPF）是许多大规模机器人系统的关键组成部分，智能体必须规划其到达给定目标位置的无碰撞路径。最近，多智能体强化学习已被引入以解决部分可观察MAPF的变体，通过在集中方式下基于每个智能体的部分观察来学习分散的单智能体策略。然而，由于这种设定的非平稳性，现有的基于学习的方法在实现复杂的多智能体合作，特别是在拥堵环境中效果不佳。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种名为基于启发式注意力的软演员批判器（SACHA）的多智能体演员-批判器方法，它采用新颖的启发式注意力机制来促进智能体之间的合作。SACHA为每个智能体学习一个神经网络，以选择性地关注多个智能体之间的最短路径启发指导。",
