    "translated_abstract": "在需求工程领域中，可解释人工智能（XAI）在将AI支持的系统与用户需求、社会期望和监管标准相一致方面的重要性日益受到认可。总体而言，可解释性已经成为影响系统质量的重要非功能性需求。然而，解释性和性能之间的所谓权衡挑战了解释性的预期正面影响。如果满足解释性的要求意味着系统性能的降低，那么必须慎重考虑这两个质量方面的优先顺序以及如何权衡它们。在本文中，我们对这种所谓的权衡进行了批判性的审视。我们认为最好以细致入微的方式来处理这个问题，考虑到资源可用性、领域特征和风险因素。通过为未来的研究和最佳实践提供基础，本工作旨在促进XAI领域的发展。",
