    "translated_abstract": "插拔（PnP）去噪是一种使用现成图像去噪器求解图像逆问题的流行迭代框架。他们的实证成功推动了一系列研究，旨在了解在对去噪器进行各种假设的情况下，PnP迭代的收敛性。虽然已经进行了大量研究来建立PnP迭代在去噪器的不同正则条件下的收敛性，但关于收敛解在测量噪声水平趋近于零时的渐近性质，即PnP方法在对去噪器进行合理假设的情况下是否可以被证明为收敛的正则化方案，目前所知甚少。本文有两个目的：首先，我们概述了逆问题中的经典正则化理论，并综述了一些近期的数据驱动方法，这些方法可被证明为收敛的正则化方案。然后，我们继续讨论PnP算法及其已建立的收敛性。",
