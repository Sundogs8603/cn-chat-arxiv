    "translated_abstract": "罗马数字分析是在调性音乐作品中识别和确定和弦以及其功能背景的重要任务。本文提出了一种基于符号音乐的自动罗马数字分析新方法。现有技术依赖于对乐谱的中间丢失压缩表示，我们提出了一种基于图神经网络(GNNs)的新方法，可以直接描述和处理乐谱中的每一个音符。所提出的架构可以利用音符特征和音符之间的相互依赖关系，并通过我们的新型边缩减算法产生按音的表示。我们的结果表明ChordGNN优于现有的最先进模型，在参考数据集上实现了更高的罗马数字分析准确率。此外，我们还探索了使用NADE和后处理和弦预测等技术的模型变体。本文的完整源代码可在https://github.com/mano上获取。",
