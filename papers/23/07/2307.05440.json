    "abstract": "Sign languages are the primary means of communication for many hard-of-hearing people worldwide. Recently, to bridge the communication gap between the hard-of-hearing community and the rest of the population, several sign language translation datasets have been proposed to enable the development of statistical sign language translation systems. However, there is a dearth of sign language resources for the Indian sign language. This resource paper introduces ISLTranslate, a translation dataset for continuous Indian Sign Language (ISL) consisting of 31k ISL-English sentence/phrase pairs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest translation dataset for continuous Indian Sign Language. We provide a detailed analysis of the dataset. To validate the performance of existing end-to-end Sign language to spoken language translation systems, we benchmark the created dataset with a transformer-based model for ISL translation.",

    "translated_abstract": "手语是全球许多听障人士的主要通信方式。最近，为了弥补听障社区与其他人群之间的沟通差距，提出了几个手语翻译数据集，以便开发统计手语翻译系统。然而，印度手语的资源匮乏。本资源论文介绍了ISLTranslate，一个用于连续印度手语（ISL）的翻译数据集，包含31k个ISL-英语句子/短语对。据我们所知，这是连续印度手语最大的翻译数据集。我们对数据集进行了详细分析。为了验证现有的端到端手语到口语翻译系统的性能，我们使用基于Transformer模型的ISL翻译对创建的数据集进行了基准测试。",
