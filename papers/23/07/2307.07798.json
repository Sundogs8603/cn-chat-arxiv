    "translated_abstract": "随着互联网和社交媒体的发展，产生了大量的非结构化数据。这些数据中包括用户对在线商店和社交媒体上产品的意见。通过对这些意见进行探索和分类，可以获取有用的信息，包括用户满意度、用户对特定事件的反馈、预测特定产品的销售情况等。在本文中，我们提出了一种使用深度学习模型进行情感分析并用于推荐产品的方法。我们使用了一个具有五层的双通道卷积神经网络模型进行意见挖掘，该模型从数据中提取了重要的特征。我们通过应用SMOTE算法来增加初始数据集的评论数量，并对数据进行平衡。然后我们对这些评论进行了聚类。我们还使用张量分解算法为每个聚类分配了一个权重，从而提高了推荐系统的性能。我们提出的方法已经在实验中取得了很好的结果。",
