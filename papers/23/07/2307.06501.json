    "translated_abstract": "目标：人工胰腺(AP)在实现1型糖尿病患者闭环血糖控制方面显示出有希望的潜力。然而，由于复杂的生理过程、延迟的胰岛素反应和不准确的血糖测量，设计一种有效的AP控制策略仍然具有挑战性。虽然模型预测控制(MPC)通过动态模型和安全约束提供了安全性和稳定性，但其缺乏个性化，并且受到未宣布的饮食影响。相反，深度强化学习(DRL)提供了个性化和自适应策略，但面临分布偏移和大量数据需求的挑战。方法：我们提出了一种混合控制策略，即HyCPAP，来应对上述挑战。HyCPAP将MPC策略与集成DRL策略相结合，充分利用两种策略的优势，同时弥补各自的局限性。",
