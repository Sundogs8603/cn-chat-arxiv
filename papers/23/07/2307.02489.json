    "abstract": "Superimposed text annotations have been under-investigated, yet are ubiquitous, useful and important, especially in medical images. Medical images also highlight the challenges posed by low resolution, noise and superimposed textual meta-information. Therefor we probed the impact of superimposing text onto medical images on VQA. Our results revealed that this textual meta-information can be added without severely degrading key measures of VQA performance. Our findings are significant because they validate the practice of superimposing text on images, even for medical images subjected to the VQA task using AI techniques. The work helps advance understanding of VQA in general and, in particular, in the domain of healthcare and medicine.",

    "translated_abstract": "叠加的文本注释一直是研究不足的，但在医学图像中普遍存在且非常重要。医学图像还突出了低分辨率、噪声和叠加的文本元信息所带来的挑战。因此，我们研究了在医学图像上叠加文本对VQA的影响。我们的研究结果表明，即使在使用AI技术进行VQA任务的医学图像中，添加这些文本元信息也不会严重降低VQA性能的关键指标。我们的发现具有重要意义，因为它们验证了在图像上叠加文本的做法，甚至适用于医学图像领域的VQA任务。该研究有助于推进对VQA的理解，特别是在医疗保健和医学领域。",
