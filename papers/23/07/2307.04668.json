    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体平台的兴起促进了回音室的形成，回音室是在线空间，用户主要遇到强化他们现有信念的观点，同时排除不同意见。这种现象显著阻碍了信息在社区之间的传播，加剧了社会极化。因此，开发量化回音室的方法至关重要。在本文中，我们提出了回音室得分（ECS），一种新颖的评估用户社区凝聚力和分离度的指标，通过测量嵌入空间中用户之间的距离来实现。与现有方法不同，ECS能够在不具备用户意识形态标签的情况下发挥作用，并且不对交互图的结构做出任何假设。为了便于测量用户之间的距离，我们提出了EchoGAE，一种基于自监督图自编码器的用户嵌入模型，利用用户的帖子和交互图将用户嵌入到一种方式中",
