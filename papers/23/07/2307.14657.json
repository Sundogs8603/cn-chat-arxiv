    "translated_abstract": "许多研究已经提出了用于恶意软件检测和分类的机器学习（ML）模型，并报道了几乎完美的性能。然而，它们以不同的方式组装基准数据集，使用多样化的静态和动态分析技术进行特征提取，甚至在对恶意软件家族的定义上也存在差异。因此，我们的研究社区仍然缺乏对恶意软件分类结果的理解：它们是否与所收集数据集的性质和分布有关，训练数据集中的家族和样本数量在多大程度上影响性能，以及静态和动态特征如何相互补充。本研究通过调查影响基于ML的恶意软件检测和分类的关键因素来回答这些开放性问题。为此，我们收集了迄今为止最大的平衡恶意软件数据集，其中包含来自670个家族的67,000个样本（每个家族100个样本），并训练了最先进的恶意软件检测和家族分类模型。",
