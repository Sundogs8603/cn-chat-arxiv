    "translated_abstract": "在自动驾驶中实现可靠的基于LiDAR的物体检测器至关重要，但其成功取决于获取大量精确的3D注释。主动学习（AL）通过使用更少的标签和可以达到与完全监督学习相当的性能的算法来减轻注释负担。尽管AL表现出了潜力，但当前方法优先选择具有高不确定性和/或多样性的未标记点云，导致选择更多实例进行标记并降低计算效率。在本文中，我们采用了一种新颖的内核编码率最大化（KECOR）策略，该策略旨在通过信息论的视角确定最具信息量的点云以获取标签。贪婪搜索被应用于寻找能够最大化编码潜在特征所需的最小比特数的期望点云。为了确定所选样本的独特性和信息量，从模型的角度进行了评估。",
