In analyzing the tails of the distribution with RV > 40, we observe the appearance of \"potential\" DK which eventually terminate in an abrupt plunge to nDK.

    "translated_abstract": "我们对历史市场波动性进行了系统性研究，涵盖了大约过去五十年的时间。我们特别关注标普500指数实现波动率（RV）的时间序列及其分布函数。如预期的，RV的最大值与该时期的最大经济动荡相一致：储蓄和贷款危机、科技泡沫、金融危机和COVID-19大流行。我们探讨了这些值是否属于以下三类之一：黑天鹅（BS），即它们位于分布的无标度、幂律尾部；龙王（DK），即与BS显著上升偏离的统计意义上的异常；或者负龙王（nDK），即与BS显著下降偏离的统计意义上的异常。通过分析RV > 40的尾部，我们观察到“潜在”的龙王的出现，最终突然转变为负龙王。随着统计窗口天数的增加，这种现象变得更加明显。",
