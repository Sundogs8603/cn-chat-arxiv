    "abstract": "Bangla (or Bengali) is the fifth most spoken language globally; yet, the state-of-the-art NLP in Bangla is lagging for even simple tasks such as lemmatization, POS tagging, etc. This is partly due to lack of a varied quality corpus. To alleviate this need, we build Vacaspati, a diverse corpus of Bangla literature. The literary works are collected from various websites; only those works that are publicly available without copyright violations or restrictions are collected. We believe that published literature captures the features of a language much better than newspapers, blogs or social media posts which tend to follow only a certain literary pattern and, therefore, miss out on language variety. Our corpus Vacaspati is varied from multiple aspects, including type of composition, topic, author, time, space, etc. It contains more than 11 million sentences and 115 million words. We also built a word embedding model, Vac-FT, using FastText from Vacaspati as well as trained an Electra mode",

    "translated_abstract": "孟加拉语（或孟加拉）是全球第五大口语，然而，孟加拉语的最新自然语言处理技术在诸如词形还原、词性标注等简单任务中仍然滞后。部分原因是缺乏多样性和高质量的语料库。为了解决这个问题，我们构建了Vacapati，一本多样的孟加拉文学语料库。我们收集了来自各个网站的文学作品，只选择那些没有版权或限制的公开作品。我们认为出版的文学作品比报纸、博客或社交媒体帖子更好地捕捉了一种语言的特点，后者通常只遵循某种特定的文学模式，因此忽视了语言的多样性。我们的Vacapati语料库从多个方面进行了多样化设计，包括作品类型、主题、作者、时间、空间等。它包含超过1100万个句子和1.15亿个单词。我们还使用Vacapati构建了一个词嵌入模型Vac-FT，使用FastText进行训练，并训练了一个Electra模型。",
