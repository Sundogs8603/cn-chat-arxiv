Despite the richness and diversity of the information it can convey, NLF is often hand-designed and arbitrary. In a different world, research in pedagogy has long established several effective feedback models. In this opinion piece, we compile ideas from pedagogy to introduce FELT, a feedback framework for LLMs that outlines the various characteristics of the feedback space, and a feedback content taxonomy based on these variables. Our taxonomy offers both a general mapping of the feedback space, as well as pedagogy-established discrete categories, allowing us to empirically demonstrate the impact of different feedback types on revised generations. In addition to streamlining existing NLF designs, FELT also brings out new, unexplored directions for research in NLF. We make our taxonomy available to the community, providing guides and examples for mapping our cat",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言反馈（NLF）是将大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类偏好对齐的一个越来越受欢迎的途径。尽管NLF可以传达丰富多样的信息，但往往是手工设计的和随意的。在不同的世界中，教育学研究长期以来建立了几种有效的反馈模型。在这篇观点文章中，我们汇编了来自教育学的思想，引入了一种名为FELT的LLMs反馈框架，概述了反馈空间的各种特征以及基于这些变量的反馈内容分类法。我们的分类法不仅提供了对反馈空间的一般映射，还提供了教育学确定的离散类别，使我们能够从经验上证明不同反馈类型对修订生成的影响。除了简化现有的NLF设计，FELT还为NLF研究带来了新的未开发的方向。我们将我们的分类法提供给社区，为映射我们的类别提供指南和示例。",
