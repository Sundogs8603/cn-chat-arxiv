    "abstract": "We investigate the response of shareholders to Environmental, Social, and Governance-related reputational risk (ESG-risk), focusing exclusively on the impact of social media. Using a dataset of 114 million tweets about firms listed on the S&P100 index between 2016 and 2022, we extract conversations discussing ESG matters. In an event study design, we define events as unusual spikes in message posting activity linked to ESG-risk, and we then examine the corresponding changes in the returns of related assets. By focusing on social media, we gain insight into public opinion and investor sentiment, an aspect not captured through ESG controversies news alone. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to distinctly separate the reputational impact on social media from the physical costs associated with negative ESG controversy news. Our results show that the occurrence of an ESG-risk event leads to a statistically significant average reduction of 0.29% in abnormal returns. Furt",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了股东对环境、社会和治理相关的声誉风险（ESG风险）的反应，重点关注社交媒体的影响。我们使用了2016年至2022年间114百万条关于S&P100指数上市公司的推文数据集，提取了讨论ESG事项的对话。通过事件研究设计，我们将异常的推文活动高峰定义为与ESG风险有关的事件，并检查相关资产回报的相应变化。通过关注社交媒体，我们可以了解公众舆论和投资者情绪，而这些方面在单纯关注ESG争议新闻中并未捕捉到。据我们所知，我们的方法是首次将社交媒体的声誉影响与负面ESG争议新闻的实际成本明确分离开来。我们的结果表明，ESG风险事件的发生导致平均异常回报下降0.29%，在统计上是显著的。",
