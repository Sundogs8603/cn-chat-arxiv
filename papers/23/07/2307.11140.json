    "translated_abstract": "数字化增加了商业机会，也增加了公司成为毁灭性网络攻击受害者的风险。因此，管理风险暴露和网络安全策略对于希望在竞争市场中生存的数字化公司至关重要。然而，理解公司特定的风险并量化其相关成本并不容易。当前的方法无法提供个性化和定量化的网络安全影响货币估计。由于资源有限和技术专长，中小型企业甚至大公司受到影响，并且难以量化其网络攻击风险。因此，必须采用新的方法来支持对网络攻击导致的财务损失的理解。本文介绍了实际网络风险价值 (RCVaR)，这是一种经济方法，利用公开的网络安全报告的现实世界信息来估算网络安全成本。RCVaR从各种来源中确定最重要的网络风险因素",
