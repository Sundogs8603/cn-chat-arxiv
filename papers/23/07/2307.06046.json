    "translated_abstract": "在归纳链接预测任务中，我们推断具有属性的多图中新测试多图中节点之间的缺失属性链接（关系）。传统的关系学习方法面临着对OOD测试多图的有限泛化能力的挑战，这些多图包含了训练中未见过的新节点和新关系类型。最近，高等人（2023）在所有关系类型共享相同结构预测模式（单个任务）的唯一假设下，提出了一种使用双可交换性理论概念（用于节点和关系类型）来进行OOD链接预测的方法，与使用图神经网络（GNNs）设计的（单个）可交换性（仅用于节点）相反。在这项工作中，我们进一步将双可交换性概念扩展到多任务双可交换性，其中我们定义了属性多图中的链接预测，这些图可能对不同的关系类型集合具有不同且可能冲突的预测模式（多个任务）。",
