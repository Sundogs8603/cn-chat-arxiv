    "abstract": "The Paris Agreement, considered a significant milestone in climate negotiations, has faced challenges in effectively addressing climate change due to the unconditional nature of most Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This has resulted in a prevalence of free-riding behavior among major polluters and a lack of concrete conditionality in NDCs. To address this issue, we propose the implementation of a decentralized, bottom-up approach called the Conditional Commitment Mechanism. This mechanism, inspired by the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, offers flexibility and incentives for early adopters, aiming to formalize conditional cooperation in international climate policy. In this paper, we provide an overview of the mechanism, its performance in the AI4ClimateCooperation challenge, and discuss potential real-world implementation aspects. Prior knowledge of the climate mitigation collective action problem, basic economic principles, and game theory concepts are assumed.",

    "translated_abstract": "巴黎协定被认为是气候谈判中的重要里程碑，但由于大多数国家自主确定贡献的无条件性质，它在有效应对气候变化方面面临挑战。这导致主要污染国存在自由骑车行为，并且国家自主确定贡献缺乏具体的条件性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个分散的自下而上的方法，名为有条件的承诺机制。这个机制受到“民主全民投票州间协定”的启发，为早期采用者提供灵活性和激励，并旨在规范国际气候政策中的有条件合作。在本文中，我们概述了这个机制，介绍了其在AI4ClimateCooperation挑战中的表现，并讨论了潜在的实际实施方面。假定读者具备有关气候减缓集体行动问题、基本经济原理和博弈论概念的先前知识。",
