    "translated_abstract": "由于著名的平均场理论，对于各种体系的无限宽度神经网络的行为的理论理解已经迅速发展。然而，对于更实际和现实重要性更强的有限网络，缺乏清晰直观的框架来延伸我们的理解。在本文中，我们展示了适当初始化的神经网络的行为可以用吸收相变中的普遍临界现象来理解。具体而言，我们研究了全连接前馈神经网络和卷积神经网络中从有序状态到混沌状态的相变，并强调了体系架构的差异与相变的普适类之间的关系。值得注意的是，我们还成功地应用了有限尺度扩展的方法，这表明了直观的现象学。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了在适当初始化的有限神经网络中的吸收相变及其普适性，证明了即使在有限网络中仍然存在着从有序状态到混沌状态的过渡，并且不同的网络架构会反映在过渡的普适类上。"
