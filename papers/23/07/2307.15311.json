    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable effectiveness in various general-domain natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their performance in transportation safety domain tasks has been suboptimal, primarily attributed to the requirement for specialized transportation safety expertise in generating accurate responses [1]. To address this challenge, we introduce TrafficSafetyGPT, a novel LLAMA-based model, which has undergone supervised fine-tuning using TrafficSafety-2K dataset which has human labels from government produced guiding books and ChatGPT-generated instruction-output pairs. Our proposed TrafficSafetyGPT model and TrafficSafety-2K train dataset are accessible at https://github.com/ozheng1993/TrafficSafetyGPT.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型在各种通用领域的自然语言处理任务中表现出了显著的效能。然而，它们在交通安全领域的任务中的性能不佳，主要是因为需要专门的交通安全专业知识来产生准确的响应。为了解决这个挑战，我们引入了TrafficSafetyGPT，这是一种基于大型语言模型的模型，经过了使用TrafficSafety-2K数据集进行的监督微调，该数据集包含了政府出版的指南书和ChatGPT生成的指导-输出对。我们提出的TrafficSafetyGPT模型和TrafficSafety-2K训练数据集可以在https://github.com/ozheng1993/TrafficSafetyGPT上获取。",
