    "translated_abstract": "信息检索（IR）领域已经取得了显著的发展，超越了传统搜索，以满足多样化的用户信息需求。最近，大型语言模型（LLM）在文本理解、生成和知识推理方面展示了出色的能力，为IR研究开辟了新的契机。LLM不仅能够促进生成式检索，还提供了改进的用户理解、模型评估和用户系统交互方案。更重要的是，IR模型、LLM和人类之间的协同关系构成了一种更强大的信息寻求技术范式。IR模型提供实时和相关的信息，LLM贡献内部知识，而人类在信息服务的可靠性方面起着需求者和评估者的中心作用。然而，仍然存在着一些重要挑战，包括计算成本、可信度问题、领域特定限制和伦理考虑。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper summarizes a strategic report from the Chinese IR community on the integration of information retrieval with large language models. Large language models have shown exceptional capabilities in text understanding, generation, and knowledge inference, opening up new directions for IR research. The synergistic relationship among IR models, LLMs, and humans forms a powerful information seeking paradigm. However, challenges such as computational costs, credibility concerns, domain-specific limitations, and ethical considerations still exist in this field."
