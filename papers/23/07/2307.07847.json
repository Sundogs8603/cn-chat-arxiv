    "translated_abstract": "云游戏是一个价值数十亿美元的行业。在云游戏中，客户端将自己的移动发送到互联网上的游戏服务器，服务器将渲染并传输结果视频回来。为了提供良好的游戏体验，需要低于80毫秒的延迟。这意味着视频的渲染、编码、传输、解码和显示必须在这个时间范围内完成，由于服务器过载、网络拥塞和丢包等因素，这一点特别具有挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了一种在云游戏中恢复丢失或损坏视频帧的新方法。与传统视频帧恢复不同，我们的方法利用游戏状态显著提升恢复准确性，并利用部分解码的帧来恢复丢失的部分。我们开发了一个综合性的系统，包括(i)高效提取游戏状态，(ii)修改 H.264 视频解码器生成一个指示需要恢复视频帧哪些部分的掩码，和 (iii)设计一个新颖的神经网络进行视频帧恢复。",
