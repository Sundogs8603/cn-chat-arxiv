    "translated_abstract": "在这项调查中，我们旨在探讨一个基本问题，即下一代人工智能是否需要量子计算。人工智能在我们日常生活的许多方面都起着重要作用，并且是第四次工业革命的核心。因此，人工智能的可靠性和值得信赖性是至关重要的。然而，人工智能的可靠性仍然存在许多问题，例如隐私、责任、安全等，在自动驾驶、医疗保健、机器人等领域都存在着。这些问题可能有各种原因，包括数据不足、偏见、鲁棒性问题，以及基本的计算问题，如数字硬件上的可计算性问题。这些可计算性问题的根源在于数字硬件基于图灵机的计算模型，该模型本质上是离散的。值得注意的是，我们的研究结果表明，数字硬件无法完全解决这些问题。",
