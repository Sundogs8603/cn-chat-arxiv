    "translated_abstract": "蚜虫是对农作物、农村家庭和全球粮食安全构成的主要威胁之一。化学防治是农作物生产中最大化产量的必要组成部分，然而考虑到环境污染和成本，将化学方法应用于整个田地是不必要的。因此，准确地定位蚜虫并估计感染水平对于精确地局部应用杀虫剂至关重要。蚜虫检测非常具有挑战性，因为每只个体蚜虫非常小，而且所有蚜虫都聚集在一起形成簇。在本文中，我们提出通过检测蚜虫簇来估计感染水平。我们在高粱田采集了数百万张图像，手动选择了5,447张包含蚜虫的图像，并对每个蚜虫簇进行了注释。为了将这些图像用于机器学习模型，我们将图像裁剪为小块，并创建了一个带有超过151,000个图像块的标签数据集。然后，我们实施并比较了不同的方法来检测蚜虫簇。",
