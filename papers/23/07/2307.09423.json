    "translated_abstract": "模仿学习 (IL) 是机器学习中最常用的方法之一。然而，虽然强大，但许多研究发现它往往不能完全恢复出潜在的专家行为。然而，这些研究没有深入探究模型和数据规模的扩大在其中的作用。受最近在自然语言处理 (NLP) 领域的工作的启发，在那里“扩大规模”已经导致了越来越有能力的领域特定语言模型 (LLMs)，我们研究了仔细扩大模型和数据规模是否可以在模仿学习的设置中带来类似的改进。为了展示我们的发现，我们将重点放在 NetHack 游戏上，这是一个具有程序生成、随机性、长期依赖性和部分可观测性的具有挑战性的环境。我们发现 IL 的损失和平均回报随着计算预算的变化而平滑变化且强相关，从而在模型大小和样本数量方面为训练计算最优的 IL 代理人的计算预算建立了幂律。我们预测并训练了几个具有 IL 的NetHack代理。",
