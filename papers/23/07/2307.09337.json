    "translated_abstract": "在计算量子化学中，精确解决薛定谔方程是关键挑战。基于深度学习的变分蒙特卡洛法（DL-VMC）最近在准确性方面超越了传统方法，但只能以巨大的计算开销为代价。在许多领域，模型只需进行一次训练，然后应用于推理，而准确的DL-VMC迄今为止需要为每个新的问题实例进行完整优化，即使是对于小分子也需要消耗数千个GPU小时。我们提出了一种经过自监督式波函数优化的大规模化学多样性分子集进行预训练的DL-VMC模型。将该模型应用于没有任何优化的新分子，可以得到胜过CCSD（T）-2Z等已建立方法的波函数和绝对能量。为了获得准确的相对能量，只需对这个基准模型进行少量微调步骤。我们通过一个全面的端到端机器学习模型实现了这一点。",
