    "abstract": "Self-supervised speech representations (SSSRs) have been successfully applied to a number of speech-processing tasks, e.g. as feature extractor for speech quality (SQ) prediction, which is, in turn, relevant for assessment and training speech enhancement systems for users with normal or impaired hearing. However, exact knowledge of why and how quality-related information is encoded well in such representations remains poorly understood. In this work, techniques for non-intrusive prediction of SQ ratings are extended to the prediction of intelligibility for hearing-impaired users. It is found that self-supervised representations are useful as input features to non-intrusive prediction models, achieving competitive performance to more complex systems. A detailed analysis of the performance depending on Clarity Prediction Challenge 1 listeners and enhancement systems indicates that more data might be needed to allow generalisation to unknown systems and (hearing-impaired) individuals",

    "translated_abstract": "自学习语音表示 (SSSRs) 已成功应用于多个语音处理任务，例如作为语音质量 (SQ) 预测的特征提取器，这对于评估和训练正常或有听力障碍的用户的语音增强系统至关重要。然而，为什么和如何将与质量相关的信息嵌入到这样的表示中仍然知之甚少。在这项工作中，非侵入式 SQ 评级预测技术被扩展到预测听力障碍用户的可理解性。发现自学习表示作为非侵入式预测模型的输入特征非常有用，其性能竞争力强于更复杂的系统。针对 Clarity Prediction Challenge 1 受试者和增强系统的性能进行了详细分析，结果表明可能需要更多数据才能推广到未知系统和（听力受损的）个体。",
