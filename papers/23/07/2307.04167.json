    "abstract": "Dreaming is a fundamental but not fully understood part of human experience that can shed light on our thought patterns. Traditional dream analysis practices, while popular and aided by over 130 unique scales and rating systems, have limitations. Mostly based on retrospective surveys or lab studies, they struggle to be applied on a large scale or to show the importance and connections between different dream themes. To overcome these issues, we developed a new, data-driven mixed-method approach for identifying topics in free-form dream reports through natural language processing. We tested this method on 44,213 dream reports from Reddit's r/Dreams subreddit, where we found 217 topics, grouped into 22 larger themes: the most extensive collection of dream topics to date. We validated our topics by comparing it to the widely-used Hall and van de Castle scale. Going beyond traditional scales, our method can find unique patterns in different dream types (like nightmares or recurring dreams)",

    "translated_abstract": "梦是人类体验的一个基本但不完全理解的部分，可以揭示我们的思维模式。传统的梦境分析方法虽然受欢迎且有130多种独特的评分系统，但存在局限性。传统方法主要基于回顾性调查或实验室研究，难以大规模应用或展示不同梦境主题之间的重要性和联系。为了克服这些问题，我们开发了一种新的数据驱动混合方法，通过自然语言处理来识别自由形式的梦境报告中的主题。我们在Reddit的r/Dreams子版块上对44,213份梦境报告进行了测试，发现了217个主题，分为22个更大的主题：到目前为止最全面的梦境主题收集。我们通过与广泛使用的Hall和van de Castle评分方法进行对比验证了我们的主题。与传统评分方法不同，我们的方法可以发现不同类型梦境（如噩梦或反复出现的梦境）中的独特模式。",
    "tldr": "本论文介绍了一种无监督混合方法，通过自然语言处理从Reddit的r/Dreams子版块中发现梦境内容。通过测试数据，得到了包含217个主题的最广泛的梦境主题集合。与传统方法相比，该方法不受规模限制，并能发现不同梦境类型的独特模式。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents an unsupervised mixed-method approach using natural language processing to discover dream content from Reddit's r/Dreams subreddit. Through testing, the authors obtained the most extensive collection of dream topics to date, consisting of 217 topics. Unlike traditional methods, this approach is not limited by scale and can identify unique patterns in different types of dreams."
