    "translated_abstract": "二次规划是凸优化领域中的基本问题。许多实际任务可以表示为二次规划，例如支持向量机（SVM）。在深度学习方法盛行之前，线性SVM是过去三十年来最流行的机器学习工具之一。一般来说，一个二次规划的输入规模为Θ(n^2)（其中n是变量的数量），因此解决该问题需要Ω(n^2)的时间。然而，SVM产生的二次规划的输入规模为O(n)，这使得设计接近线性时间算法成为可能。两个重要的SVM类别是具有低秩核因式分解和低树宽规模的程序。低树宽凸优化在过去几年中引起了越来越多的关注（例如线性规划[Dong, Lee and Ye 2021]和半定规划[Gu and Song 2022]）。因此，一个重要的开放问题是是否存在接近线性时间算法。",
