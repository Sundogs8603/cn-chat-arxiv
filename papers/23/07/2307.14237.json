This research proposes a multi-objective evolutionary neural network approach to developing controllers for swarms of robots. The swarm robot controllers are trained in a low-fidelity Python simulator and then tested in a high-fidelity simulated environment using Webots.

The results presented demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively control each of the robots. The robot swarm exhibits different behaviours as the weighting for each objective is adjusted.

    "translated_abstract": "许多群体机器人任务由多个相互冲突的目标组成。本研究提出了一种基于多目标演化神经网络的方法来开发机器人群体的控制器。群体机器人控制器在低保真的Python模拟器中进行训练，然后在高保真的Webots模拟环境中进行测试。通过进行模拟实验，测试了演化出的多目标机器人控制器在具有更多机器人的环境中的可扩展性。实验结果表明，该方法可以有效地控制每个机器人。机器人群体在调整每个目标 的权重时表现出不同的行为。结果还证实，在低保真模拟器中演化出的多目标神经网络控制器可以传输到高保真模拟环境，并且控制器能够在具有更多机器人的环境中进行扩展，无需进一步重新训练。",
