    "translated_abstract": "传统上，机器学习通常在模型层面进行研究：研究人员衡量和改进特定模型的准确性、鲁棒性、偏见、效率和其他维度。实际上，机器学习的社会影响取决于机器学习部署的周围环境。为了捕捉这一点，我们引入了生态系统级分析：不是分析单个模型，而是考虑在给定环境中部署的所有模型的集合。例如，在招聘中进行生态系统级分析意味着认识到一个求职者的结果不仅仅取决于单个招聘算法或公司，而是取决于他们申请的所有公司的集体决策。在三种模式（文本、图像、语音）和11个数据集上，我们建立了一个明显的趋势：部署的机器学习容易出现系统性故障，这意味着一些用户被所有可用的模型错误分类。即使在个体模型随时间在总体水平上改善，我们也发现",
