    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种市场机制，通过设置边缘价格来激励战略性代理商组织旅行，以有效共享有限的网络容量。该市场允许代理商组成团队共享旅行，做出出发时间和路线选择的决策，并支付边缘价格和其他成本。我们发展了一种新的方法来分析市场均衡的存在和计算，建立在组合拍卖和动态网络流理论的基础上。我们的方法解决了市场均衡特征化中的挑战，包括：（a）共享有限边缘容量中旅行的动态流量所引发的整数和网络约束；（b）战略性代理商的异质和私人偏好。我们提供了关于网络拓扑和代理商偏好的充分条件，以确保市场均衡的存在和多项式时间计算。我们确定了一个特定的市场均衡，实现了所有代理商的最大效用，并且与经典的最大流最小割问题等价。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study presents a market design for dynamic pricing and pooling in capacitated networks, which incentivizes agents to share limited network capacity through setting edge prices. The study provides sufficient conditions to ensure the existence and polynomial-time computation of market equilibrium, taking into account integer and network constraints as well as heterogenous agent preferences. A specific market equilibrium that maximizes utilities for all agents is identified."
