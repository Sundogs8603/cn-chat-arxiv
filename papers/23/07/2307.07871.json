    "translated_abstract": "发展心理学家长期以来已经确立了社会认知能力在人类智力中的重要性。这些能力使我们能够进入、参与和从人类文化中受益。社会交互代理的AI研究大多关注多智能体环境中文化的出现（通常没有强烈的发展心理学基础）。我们认为AI研究应该受心理学启发，并研究能够进入文化的社会认知能力。我们讨论了Michael Tomasello和Jerome Bruner的理论，介绍了他们的一些概念，并概述了关键概念和社会认知能力。我们提出了社会AI学校——一个包括定制参数化环境的工具，简化了关于这些概念的实验。我们展示了使用RL代理和大型语言模型进行此类实验的示例。这项工作的主要动机是吸引AI社区围绕这些概念进行讨论和研究。",
