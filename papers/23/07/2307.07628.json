    "translated_abstract": "引导是一种旨在影响人们思考和行动的行为策略。在我们的日常生活中，可以找到许多引导技术，这些引导技术可以针对人类快速和无意识的思维，例如使用图像产生恐惧，或更谨慎和费力的慢思维，例如释放让我们反思选择的信息。在本文中，我们提出并讨论了一个基于价值的AI人合作框架，在这个框架中，AI系统通过提供决策建议来引导人类。基于建议何时呈现给人类，我们提出了三种不同的引导方式，分别用于刺激人类的快速思考、慢思考或元认知。决定何时以及如何使用这些引导方式的是与特定决策场景相关的价值观。价值观包括决策质量、速度、人类技能提升和学习、人类主动性以及隐私等。在同一个决策场景中可以存在多个价值观。",
