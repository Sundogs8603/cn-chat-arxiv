    "translated_abstract": "无论领域如何，预测正在运行的过程实例的未来行为都是决策者关注的问题，特别是当多个实例相互作用时。受机器学习研究的最新进展的推动，已经提出了几种方法来自动预测过程的下一个活动、结果或剩余时间。然而，构建具有高预测能力的模型既需要从事件日志数据中提取有意义的特征的内在知识，又需要捕捉数据中的复杂模式的模型。这项工作以跨案例预测过程监测（PPM）的最新进展为基础，全面评估了跨案例特征对预测准确性的影响。此外，它还包括量子机器学习模型，这些模型被预期在特征维度不断扩展时比经典模型具有优势。对来自BPI挑战赛的真实训练数据的评估表明，跨案例特征对预测准确性有着显著影响。",
