    "translated_abstract": "随着深度学习模型的不断进步和在实际系统中的日益广泛应用，鲁棒性问题仍然是一个重大挑战。现有的认证训练方法可以在某些扰动水平上获得高度可证明的鲁棒性保证。然而，这些模型的主要问题是在干净的未扰动数据上准确性严重降低，使其不实用。在本工作中，我们考虑了在特定的高准确性水平上最大化模型的鲁棒性的更现实的角度。为此，我们提出了一种基于关键观点的新型认证训练方法，即使用自适应认证半径进行训练有助于提高模型的准确性和鲁棒性，推进了最先进的准确性-鲁棒性权衡。我们在MNIST、CIFAR-10和TinyImageNet数据集上展示了所提出方法的有效性。",
