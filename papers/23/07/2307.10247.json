Acquiring action models from narrative texts in an automated way is essential, but challenging because of the inherent complexities of such texts. We present NaRuto, a system that extracts structured events from narrative text and subsequently generates planning-language-style action models based on predictions of commonsense event relations, as well as textual contradictions and similarities, in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results in classical narrative planning domains show that NaRuto can generate action models of significantly better quality than existing fully automated methods, and even on par with those of semi-automated methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "行动模型以前提/效果公理的形式存在，为人工智能代理提供行动之间的因果关联和动机连接。行动模型获取被认为是计划技术应用中的瓶颈，特别是在叙事计划中。从叙事文本中以自动化的方式获取行动模型是必要的，但由于这样的文本本质上复杂，因此具有挑战性。我们提出了NaRuto，一个系统，它可以从叙事文本中提取结构化事件，并基于常识事件关系的预测以及文本上的矛盾和相似性无监督地生成计划语言风格的行动模型。经典的叙事计划领域的实验结果显示，NaRuto可以生成质量显著优于现有完全自动化方法的行动模型，甚至与半自动化方法的行动模型相媲美。",
