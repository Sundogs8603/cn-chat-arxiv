    "abstract": "Over the last decade, there has been a vast increase in eating disorder diagnoses and eating disorder-attributed deaths, reaching their zenith during the Covid-19 pandemic. This immense growth derived in part from the stressors of the pandemic but also from increased exposure to social media, which is rife with content that promotes eating disorders. Such content can induce eating disorders in viewers. This study aimed to create a multimodal deep learning model capable of determining whether a given social media post promotes eating disorders based on a combination of visual and textual data. A labeled dataset of Tweets was collected from Twitter, upon which twelve deep learning models were trained and tested. Based on model performance, the most effective deep learning model was the multimodal fusion of the RoBERTa natural language processing model and the MaxViT image classification model, attaining accuracy and F1 scores of 95.9% and 0.959 respectively. The RoBERTa and MaxViT fusion",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，饮食紊乱的诊断和与之相关的死亡数量大幅增加，尤其是在新冠疫情期间。这种巨大增长部分来源于疫情的压力，但也与社交媒体的暴露增加有关，社交媒体上充斥着促进饮食紊乱的内容。这些内容可以诱发观看者的饮食紊乱。本研究旨在创建一个多模态深度学习模型，能够基于视觉和文本数据的组合判断给定的社交媒体帖子是否促进饮食紊乱。从Twitter收集了一个带有标签的推文数据集，对其进行了十二个深度学习模型的训练和测试。根据模型的性能，最有效的深度学习模型是RoBERTa自然语言处理模型和MaxViT图像分类模型的多模态融合模型，准确率和F1分数分别达到95.9%和0.959。RoBERTa和MaxViT融合模型可以有效地识别社交媒体上的促进饮食紊乱的内容。",
