    "translated_abstract": "在现实金融市场中，确定等价比率是投资者考虑的重要因素。通过一个特定公司的确定等价比率的数值，投资者可以判断这个公司是否值得投资。本文将探讨如何获得确定等价比率的数值，以便评估给定公司的价值。首先，我们将介绍本文的理论支持，即Put-Call Parity。根据Put-Call Parity，我们将推导出确定等价比率的数学表达式。其次，我们将使用确定等价比率的数学表达式进行实证研究。我们将考虑一些极端例子，包括到2023年为止表现最佳和最差的股票。基于这些股票的数据，我们将可视化展示这些股票的表现，并解释数据的含义。最后，我们将把结果应用到一个非常受欢迎的行业——电动汽车行业。",
