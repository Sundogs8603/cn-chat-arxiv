    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）的广泛应用和多样性需要在其设计中考虑多样性与包容性（D＆I）原则，以确保公平、信任和透明。然而，这些考虑往往被忽视，导致偏见、歧视和不可信的问题。为了解决这些问题，我们进行了一项系统性的综述，揭示了与人工智能中的D＆I相关的挑战和解决方案。我们严格搜索了2017年至2022年间发表的48篇研究文章。对这些论文进行编码分析，共发现55个关于AI中D＆I的独特挑战和33个解决方案，以及24个关于使用AI增强这些实践的独特挑战和23个解决方案。通过对这些问题的深入理解，本研究将为寻求将这些原则融入未来AI系统的研究人员和从业者提供启示。",
