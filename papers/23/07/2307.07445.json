    "translated_abstract": "在未来的6G移动边缘计算（MEC）中，自动驾驶系统需要具备处理多模态数据和强相互依赖性的能力。然而，传统启发式算法由于需要多次迭代来得到最优方案，在实时调度方面表现不佳。我们提出了一种基于Transformer的创新网络TSNet-SAC，仅利用启发式算法指导TSNet的训练。此外，我们引入了滑动增强组件（SAC）来增强鲁棒性和解决算法缺陷。此外，我们设计了扩展组件来处理多尺度训练数据并提供网络可扩展性，使得TSNet能够适应不同的接入场景。模拟实验表明，TSNet-SAC在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有网络，与启发式算法相比具有更优的调度决策延迟。",
