    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在不完全遵守的随机对照试验中，根据“匹配对”确定治疗状态的局部平均治疗效应的推断。通过“匹配对”，我们指的是从感兴趣的总体中独立和随机抽取单位，根据观察到的基线协变量进行配对，然后在每个对中，随机选择一个单位进行治疗。在对匹配质量进行的弱假设下，我们首先推导了传统的Wald（即二阶最小二乘）估计器的局部平均治疗效应的极限行为。我们进一步显示，传统的异方差性稳健估计器的极限方差通常是保守的，即其可能性极限比极限方差（通常严格地）大。因此，我们提供了一种对所需数量一致的极限方差的替代估计器。最后，我们考虑了额外观察到的基线协变量的使用。",
