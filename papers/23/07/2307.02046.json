    "translated_abstract": "随着电子商务和网络应用的繁荣，推荐系统（RecSys）已经成为我们日常生活中重要的组成部分，为用户提供个性化建议以满足其喜好。尽管深度神经网络（DNN）通过模拟用户-物品交互和整合文本侧信息在提升推荐系统方面取得了重要进展，但是DNN方法仍然存在一些限制，例如理解用户兴趣、捕捉文本侧信息的困难，以及在不同推荐场景中泛化和推理能力的不足等。与此同时，大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现（例如ChatGPT和GPT4）在自然语言处理（NLP）和人工智能（AI）领域引起了革命，因为它们在语言理解和生成的基本职责上有着卓越的能力，同时具有令人印象深刻的泛化和推理能力。",
    "tldr": "大型语言模型在推荐系统中的应用已经带来了显著的改进，克服了传统DNN方法的限制，并提供了强大的语言理解、生成、推理和泛化能力。",
    "en_tdlr": "The application of large language models in recommender systems has brought significant improvements, overcoming the limitations of traditional DNN methods and providing powerful capabilities in language understanding, generation, reasoning, and generalization."
