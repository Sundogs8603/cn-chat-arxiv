    "translated_abstract": "慢性压力会极大地影响身体和心理健康。可穿戴技术的出现允许跟踪生理信号，潜在地导致创新的压力预测和干预方法。然而，标签稀缺和数据异质性等挑战使得在实践中很难进行压力预测。为了应对这些问题，我们开发了一种使用可穿戴生物信号数据的多模态个性化压力预测系统。我们采用自监督学习（SSL）在每个受试者的数据上进行预训练，使模型在微调压力预测任务之前学习参与者生物信号的基线动态。我们在可穿戴压力和情感检测（WESAD）数据集上对模型进行了测试，结果显示我们的SSL模型在使用少于5%的标注情况下优于非SSL模型。这些结果表明我们的方法可以通过最少的注释实现对每个用户的个性化压力预测。",
