    "abstract": "Domain adaptation is an important and widely studied problem in natural language processing. A large body of literature tries to solve this problem by adapting models trained on the source domain to the target domain. In this paper, we instead solve this problem from a dataset perspective. We modify the source domain dataset with simple lexical transformations to reduce the domain shift between the source dataset distribution and the target dataset distribution. We find that models trained on the transformed source domain dataset performs significantly better than zero-shot models. Using our proposed transformations to convert standard English to tweets, we reach an unsupervised part-of-speech (POS) tagging accuracy of 92.14% (from 81.54% zero shot accuracy), which is only slightly below the supervised performance of 94.45%. We also use our proposed transformations to synthetically generate tweets and augment the Twitter dataset to achieve state-of-the-art performance for POS tagging.",

    "translated_abstract": "领域适应是自然语言处理中重要且广泛研究的问题。大量文献尝试通过将源领域训练的模型适应到目标领域来解决这个问题。本文从数据集的角度解决了这个问题。我们通过简单的词汇转换修改源领域数据集，以减少源数据集分布和目标数据集分布之间的领域差异。我们发现在转换后的源领域数据集上训练的模型比零样本模型表现更好。通过将标准英语转换为推特文本，我们实现了92.14%的无监督词性标注准确率（相比于81.54%的零样本准确率），仅略低于94.45%的有监督性能。我们还使用提出的转换方法合成推特文本并增加推特数据集，以实现词性标注的最新性能。",
