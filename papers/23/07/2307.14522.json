    "translated_abstract": "临床试验是评估新的生物医学干预措施的研究。为了设计新的试验，研究人员从当前和已完成的试验中汲取灵感。2022年，每天平均有100多个临床试验提交到ClinicalTrials.gov，每个试验平均有约1500个单词。这几乎不可能及时跟上。为了缓解这个问题，我们使用GPT-3.5创建了一个批量临床试验摘要工具CliniDigest。据我们所知，CliniDigest是第一个能够提供实时、真实和全面的临床试验摘要的工具。CliniDigest可以将多达85个临床试验描述（约10500个单词）缩减为一个简洁的200个词的摘要，带有参考文献和有限的虚构内容。我们已经测试了CliniDigest在27个医学子领域中涉及的457个试验的摘要能力。对于每个领域，CliniDigest生成的摘要平均为153个单词，标准差为69个单词，其中每个摘要平均使用54个单词。",
