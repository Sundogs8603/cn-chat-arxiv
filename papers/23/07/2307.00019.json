    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了一个模型，其中智能冲浪者在由Chirikov标准映射中的混沌动力学生成的Ulam网络上移动。该有向网络是通过Ulam方法获得的，利用固定大小的相空间单元形成马尔可夫链的节点。该冲浪者的目标是确定从初始节点A到最终节点B的网络路径，其阻力最小，即转移概率的倒数之和最小。我们开发了一种算法，使智能冲浪者能够在少量的转移中完成搜索，其数量仅以网络大小的对数增长。最优路径搜索在具有正向和逆向网络的小Erd\\\"os数节点形成的分形交集集合上进行。智能冲浪者在尽量减小与目标B的相空间距离的愚蠢冲浪者上呈指数级优势。我们认为，这种算法为在混沌流动中进行运动控制提供了新的线索。",
