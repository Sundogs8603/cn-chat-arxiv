    "translated_abstract": "生成对抗网络（GANs）是生成人工智能领域中最强大且多功能的技术之一。在本研究中，我们报告了GANs在合成光谱数据生成领域的应用，为解决在各种科学背景下数据稀缺的问题提供了一种解决方案。我们通过将其应用于近场辐射传热领域中的一个多层次双曲介质问题来展示所提出的方法。我们发现成功生成光谱数据需要对传统GANs进行两个修改：（i）引入Wasserstein GANs（WGANs）以避免模式崩溃，以及（ii）对WGANs进行条件化以获得生成数据的准确标签。我们展示了一个简单的前馈神经网络（FFNN），在有限数据条件下，通过使用CWGAN生成的数据，显著提高了其性能，证明了其内在价值。",
