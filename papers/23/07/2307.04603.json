    "translated_abstract": "一致性和可靠性对于进行人工智能研究至关重要。许多著名的研究领域，如目标检测，已经通过稳定的基准框架进行了比较和验证。在AlphaFold2之后，蛋白质折叠任务已经进入了一个新阶段，许多方法都是基于AlphaFold2的组件提出的。在蛋白质折叠中，一个统一的研究框架的重要性包括实现和基准，以一致且公平地比较各种方法。为了实现这一点，我们提出了Solvent，一个支持最新模型重要组件的蛋白质折叠框架。Solvent包含在一个统一的代码库中实现的不同模型，并支持在相同数据集上对定义的模型进行训练和评估。我们对著名算法及其组件进行了基准测试，并进行了实验以对蛋白质结构建模领域提供有用的见解。我们希望Solvent能提高蛋白质折叠研究的可靠性。",
