    "abstract": "One major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is the large amount of steps for the RL agent needs to converge in the training process and learn the optimal policy, especially in text-based game environments where the action space is extensive.

    "translated_abstract": "强化学习(RL)中的一个主要挑战是RL智能体在训练过程中需要收敛并学习最优策略的大量步骤，尤其是在动作空间广泛的基于文本的游戏环境中。然而，非玩家角色(NPCs)有时会拥有游戏的关键信息，这些信息有助于更快地训练RL智能体。因此，本文探讨了如何与NPC智能体进行交互和对话，利用大型语言模型(LLMs)获取关键信息，并使用知识图谱(KGs)和故事塑造来加速RL智能体的训练。",
