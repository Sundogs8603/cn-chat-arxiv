    "abstract": "This paper studies the inferential theory for estimating low-rank matrices. It also provides an inference method for the average treatment effect as an application. We show that the least square estimation of eigenvectors following the nuclear norm penalization attains the asymptotic normality. The key contribution of our method is that it does not require sample splitting. In addition, this paper allows dependent observation patterns and heterogeneous observation probabilities. Empirically, we apply the proposed procedure to estimating the impact of the presidential vote on allocating the U.S. federal budget to the states.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了用于估计低秩矩阵的推断理论，并提出了一种平均处理效应的推断方法。我们证明了在核范数惩罚下的最小二乘估计的特征向量达到了渐近正态性。我们方法的关键创新之处在于不需要样本分割。此外，本文允许依赖性观测模式和异质观测概率。在实证方面，我们将所提出的方法应用到估计总统选举对将美国联邦预算分配给各州的影响。",

The least square estimation with nuclear norm penalization achieves asymptotic normality and can handle dependent observation patterns and heterogeneous observation probabilities.
