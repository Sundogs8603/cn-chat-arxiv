    "abstract": "Logical assessment formula (LAF) is a new theory proposed for evaluations with inaccurate ground-truth labels (IAGTLs) to assess the predictive models for various artificial intelligence applications. However, the practicability of LAF for evaluations with IAGTLs has not yet been validated in real-world practice. In this paper, to address this issue, we applied LAF to tumour segmentation for breast cancer (TSfBC) in medical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA).
