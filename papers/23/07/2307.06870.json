    "abstract": "A robot deployed in a home over long stretches of time faces a true lifelong learning problem. As it seeks to provide assistance to its users, the robot should leverage any accumulated experience to improve its own knowledge to become a more proficient assistant. We formalize this setting with a novel lifelong learning problem formulation in the context of learning for task and motion planning (TAMP). Exploiting the modularity of TAMP systems, we develop a generative mixture model that produces candidate continuous parameters for a planner. Whereas most existing lifelong learning approaches determine a priori how data is shared across task models, our approach learns shared and non-shared models and determines which to use online during planning based on auxiliary tasks that serve as a proxy for each model's understanding of a state. Our method exhibits substantial improvements in planning success on simulated 2D domains and on several problems from the BEHAVIOR benchmark.",

    "translated_abstract": "在一个长时间内部署在家中的机器人面临着真正的终身学习问题。作为机器人寻求为用户提供帮助，它应该利用任何积累的经验来改进自己的知识，成为一个更熟练的助手。我们在任务和运动规划（TAMP）学习的背景下，对这种情况进行了新颖的终身学习问题建模。利用TAMP系统的模块化特性，我们开发了一个生成混合模型，为规划器生成候选连续参数。与大多数现有的终身学习方法预先确定数据如何在任务模型之间共享不同，我们的方法学习共享和非共享模型，并根据代理任务来决定在规划过程中在线使用哪个模型，这些任务作为每个模型对状态的理解的代理。我们的方法在模拟的2D领域和BEHAVIOR基准测试中的多个问题上展示了显著的规划成功的改进。",

By leveraging the modularity of TAMP systems, the authors propose a generative mixture model that generates candidate parameters for planners. The method learns shared and non-shared models and dynamically selects the appropriate model online based on auxiliary tasks, leading to significant improvements in planning success on simulated 2D domains and the BEHAVIOR benchmark."
