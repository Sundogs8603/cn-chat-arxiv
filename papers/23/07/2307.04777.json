    "abstract": "Mental health disorders remain a significant challenge in modern healthcare, with diagnosis and treatment often relying on subjective patient descriptions and past medical history. To address this issue, we propose a personalized mental health tracking and mood prediction system that utilizes patient physiological data collected through personal health devices. Our system leverages a decentralized learning mechanism that combines transfer and federated machine learning concepts using smart contracts, allowing data to remain on users' devices and enabling effective tracking of mental health conditions for psychiatric treatment and management in a privacy-aware and accountable manner. We evaluate our model using a popular mental health dataset that demonstrates promising results. By utilizing connected health systems and machine learning models, our approach offers a novel solution to the challenge of providing psychiatrists with further insight into their patients' mental health outside",

    "translated_abstract": "在现代医疗中，心理健康障碍仍然是一个重要挑战，诊断和治疗往往依赖于患者的主观描述和过去的病史。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个个性化的心理健康跟踪与情绪预测系统，利用通过个人健康设备收集的患者生理数据。我们的系统利用了分散学习机制，结合了转移学习和联邦机器学习的概念，使用智能合约，使数据保留在用户设备上，并以隐私意识和有责任感的方式有效跟踪精神病学治疗和管理中的心理健康状况。我们使用了一个流行的心理健康数据集对模型进行评估，结果显示了良好的效果。通过利用连接的健康系统和机器学习模型，我们的方法为提供精神科医生对患者的心理健康状况外部提供了新的解决方案。",
