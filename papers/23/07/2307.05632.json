    "translated_abstract": "在之前的工作中，我们使用“来自概率的知识”（TARK 2021）开发了一个相对问题、概率的信念模型。根据这个模型，相对于给定问题，一个人相信的内容应该（i）在蕴涵运算下保持稳定，（ii）在他们的证据下具有足够的概率，以及（iii）对问题的答案的相对概率敏感。在这里，我们探讨了这个模型对信念动态的影响。我们证明了它所验证的原则要比AGM等传统信念修正理论的原则要弱，但仍然比与高主观概率等同的流行的Lockean信念理论要强。然后，我们考虑了一类适用于许多但不适用于所有应用的模型，并且确定了在这一类模型上还有效的一些自然原则。最后，我们通过比较Leitgeb和Lin和的概率信念模型，得出了这个现有框架具有比较优势的结论。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the dynamics of belief using a question-relative, probabilistic account of belief. The study shows that the principles validated by this account are weaker than traditional belief revision theories but stronger than the Lockean theory of belief. Additionally, the paper introduces natural principles applicable to specific models and compares the framework to other probabilistic accounts of belief."
