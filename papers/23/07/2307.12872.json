However, these GANs-based schemes suffer from low training efficiency as the generator needs to be retrained for each target model during the substitute training process, as well as low generation quality. To overcome these limitations, we consider utilizing the diffusion model to generate data, and propose a novel data-free substitute attack scheme based on the Stable Diffusion (SD) to improve the efficiency and accuracy of substitute training. Despite the data generated by the SD exhibiting high quality, it presents a different distribution of domains and a large variation of positive and negative samples for the target model. For this problem, we propose Latent Code Augmentation (LCA) to facilitate SD in generating data that aligns with the data ",

    "translated_abstract": "在黑盒替代攻击中，由于目标模型的训练数据不可用，大多数最近的方案利用GAN生成数据来训练替代模型。然而，这些基于GAN的方案在训练效率上存在问题，因为生成器在替代训练过程中每次需要重新训练为目标模型，同时生成质量不高。为了克服这些限制，我们考虑利用扩散模型生成数据，并提出了一种基于稳定扩散（SD）的新型无数据替代攻击方案，以提高替代训练的效率和准确性。尽管SD生成的数据质量很高，但它呈现出不同的领域分布以及目标模型正负样本的大变化。针对这个问题，我们提出了潜在编码增强（LCA）来促进SD生成与目标数据对齐的数据。",
