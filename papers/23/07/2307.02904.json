    "translated_abstract": "持续性同调条码和图是拓扑数据分析的基础。它们在许多真实数据环境中得到广泛应用，将拓扑信息的变化（通过细胞同调测量）与数据的变化相关联，然而，由于其复杂的几何结构，它们在统计环境中的使用具有挑战性。在本文中，我们重新审视了持续性同调秩函数——一种衡量“形状”的不变量，它在条码和持续性图之前被引入，并以更适合数据和计算的形式捕捉相同的信息。尤其是，由于它们是函数，当持续性同调以秩函数形式表示时，可以直接应用函数数据分析领域的技术，这是一种适用于函数的统计学领域。然而，与条码相比，秩函数的受欢迎程度较低，因为它们面临着稳定性的挑战——这是验证它们在数据分析中使用的关键性质，而这种稳定性很难保证。",
