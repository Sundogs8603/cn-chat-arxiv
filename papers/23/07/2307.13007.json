    "translated_abstract": "近年来，使用误差反向传播算法对多层脉冲神经网络（SNNs）进行训练取得了显著进展。在各种训练方案中，直接使用神经元的发放时间的误差反向传播方法引起了广泛关注，因为它可以实现理想的时间编码。这种方法使用时间到第一个尖峰（TTFS）编码，在这种编码中，每个神经元最多只能发放一次，而这种发放次数限制可以以极低的发放频率进行信息处理。这种低发放频率增加了SNNs中的信息处理能效，这不仅因为其与大脑信息处理的相似性，而且还从工程角度来看也是重要的。然而，对于TTFS编码的SNNs，目前只提供了一个上界，还没有完全研究在更低的发放频率下的信息处理能力。在本文中，我们提出了两种稀疏激发正则化方法。",
