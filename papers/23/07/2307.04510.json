    "translated_abstract": "最小二乘回归最初是用于美式期权定价的，但现在已经扩展到了摇摆期权定价。摇摆期权的价格可以看作是一个反向动态规划原理的解，其中包含一个称为继续值的条件期望。使用最小二乘回归逼近继续值的方法涉及两个级别的逼近。首先，继续值被一个有限集合的$m$个平方可积函数（回归函数）生成的子空间的正交投影所替代，得到摇摆价值函数的第一个近似值$V^m$。在本文中，我们证明，通过选择合适的回归函数，$V^m$当$m \\to + \\infty$时收敛到摇摆实际价格$V$。当回归函数被神经网络替代时，也证明了类似的结果。对于这两种方法（最小二乘或神经网络），我们分析了第二级别的逼近。",
