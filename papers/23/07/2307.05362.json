    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在自动睡眠阶段分类中发挥了重要作用，因为它们具有强大的表示能力和内部特征转换能力。然而，原始睡眠数据中的类别不平衡和个体异质性往往会显著影响任何机器学习算法的分类性能。为了解决这两个问题，本文开发了一种名为SleepEGAN的生成对抗网络（GAN）增强的集成深度学习模型，用于不平衡睡眠阶段的分类。为了缓解类别不平衡问题，我们提出了一种针对EEG信号特征的新GAN架构（称为EGAN），用于数据增强。在训练过程中使用少数类别的生成样本。此外，我们设计了一种无成本的集成学习策略，以减少由验证集和测试集之间的异质性引起的模型估计方差，从而提高准确性和鲁棒性。",
