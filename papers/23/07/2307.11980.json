    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的MRI图像中对比剂剂量的降低和消除得到了广泛关注，考虑到钆基对比剂的不良影响。然而，这些深度学习算法受到高质量低剂量数据集的限制。此外，不同类型的对比剂和病理需要不同剂量水平的深度学习算法才能可靠工作。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于全局变换器(Gformer)的新型迭代建模方法，用于合成具有与不同剂量水平相对应的任意对比增强图像。所提出的Gformer结合了基于子采样的注意机制和旋转平移模块，捕捉了各种与对比度相关的特征。定量评估表明，所提出的模型优于其他最先进的方法。我们还对剂量降低和肿瘤分割等下游任务进行了定量评估，以展示其临床-",
