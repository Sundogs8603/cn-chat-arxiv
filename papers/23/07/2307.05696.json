    "abstract": "The exponential growth of textual data has created a crucial need for tools that assist users in extracting meaningful insights. Traditional document summarization approaches often fail to meet individual user requirements and lack structure for efficient information processing. To address these limitations, we propose Summation, a hierarchical personalized concept-based summarization approach. It synthesizes documents into a concise hierarchical concept map and actively engages users by learning and adapting to their preferences. Using a Reinforcement Learning algorithm, Summation generates personalized summaries for unseen documents on specific topics. This framework enhances comprehension, enables effective navigation, and empowers users to extract meaningful insights from large document collections aligned with their unique requirements.",

    "translated_abstract": "文本数据呈指数级增长，需要工具来帮助用户提取有意义的见解。传统的文档摘要方法通常无法满足个人用户需求，并且缺乏高效信息处理的结构。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种层级个性化基于概念的总结方法。该方法将文档综合成简洁的层级概念图，并通过学习和适应用户偏好来积极参与用户。使用强化学习算法，该方法为特定主题的未见文档生成个性化摘要。该框架提高了理解能力，实现了有效的导航，并使用户能够根据自己独特的需求从大量文档集合中提取有意义的见解。",
