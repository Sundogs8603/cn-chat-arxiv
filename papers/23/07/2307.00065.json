    "translated_abstract": "在餐厅、仓库或医院等日常生活中部署服务机器人需要对密集和动态场景中发生的交互进行推理。本文提出并对三种新的方法进行了基准测试，用于建模和预测密集场景中的多智能体交互，包括使用直观的定性表示。所提出的解决方案考虑了静态和动态的上下文来预测个体之间的交互。它们利用了输入和时间关注机制，并在中长期时间范围内进行了测试。前两种方法将称为定性轨迹计算(QTC)的不同关系与最先进的深度神经网络相结合，创建了一个符号驱动的神经结构，用于预测空间交互。第三种方法实现了一种纯数据驱动的网络用于运动预测，该网络的输出经过后期处理以预测QTC空间交互。实验结果表明...",
