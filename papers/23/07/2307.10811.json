To investigate human-LLM collaboration patterns and dynamics during prewriting, we conducted a three-session qualitative study with 15 participants in two creative tasks: story writing and slogan writing.

    "translated_title": "\"感觉像有第二个思维\": 探究在大型语言模型中进行创意可写性预写的人机共创",
    "translated_abstract": "预写是在第一稿之前发现和发展思想的过程，它需要发散性思维，通常涉及到无结构的策略，如图表、概述和自由写作等。虽然已经证明大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种任务中都是有用的，包括创意写作，但对用户如何与LLMs合作来支持预写的方式知之甚少。在这种创造性过程中，LLMs的首选合作角色和主动性也不明确。为了研究人类与LLMs在预写过程中的合作模式和动力学，我们进行了一项三节次的定性研究，与15位参与者进行了两个创造性任务：写故事和写口号。研究结果表明，在合作的预写过程中，似乎存在着一个三阶段迭代的人机共创过程，包括构思、启发和实施阶段。这个合作过程以人类在主导角色中取得了成功。",
