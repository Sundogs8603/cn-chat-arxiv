    "translated_abstract": "法律案件检索是一项特殊的信息检索任务，关注的是法律案件文件。根据检索到的案件文件的下游任务和用户的信息需求，法律案件检索中的信息需求与网络搜索和传统的自适应检索任务可能会有显著的区别。虽然有几项研究根据文本相似性来检索法律案件，但作为本文所示，法律检索用户的潜在搜索意图更加复杂，但大部分尚未探索。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的法律案件检索的意图分类法。它由五种意图类型组成，根据三个标准进行分类，即搜索特定案例，特征描述，处罚，程序和利益。该分类法通过透明的构建和广泛的评估，包括访谈、编辑用户研究和查询日志分析。通过实验室用户研究，我们揭示了用户行为和满意度方面的显著差异。",
