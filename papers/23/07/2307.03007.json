    "translated_abstract": "手动装配工人在工作中面临着越来越复杂的情况。人性化辅助系统可以帮助解决问题，但作为实现技术的物体识别却阻碍了这些系统的复杂的人性化设计。同时，基于手势姿势的活动识别在复杂使用情景下（如佩戴手套）中存在姿势估计不准确的问题。本文提出了一个自监督的流程，用于将手势姿势估计适应特定的使用场景，并尽量减少人为干预。这使得基于手势姿势的活动识别更加廉价和稳健。该流程包括一个通用的机器学习模型，用于在广义数据集上训练手势姿势估计，空间和时间滤波以考虑手部解剖约束，以及一个重新训练的步骤来改进模型。在一个公开可用和注释的数据集上评估了不同的参数组合。然后将最佳参数和模型组合应用到未标记视频样本上，来验证效果。",
