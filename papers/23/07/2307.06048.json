We propose MaxCOSD, an online algorithm that has provable guarantees even for problems with non-i.i.d. demands and stateful dynamics, including for instance perishability. We consider what we call non-degeneracy assumptions on the demand process, and argue that they are necessary to allow learning.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究多产品库存控制问题，其中经理根据部分历史信息作出顺序补充决策，以最小化其累积损失。我们的动机是考虑到一般需求、损失和动态，超越通常依赖新闻供应商类型损失、固定动态和不现实的独立同分布需求假设的标准模型。我们提出了MaxCOSD，一个在线算法，即使对于非独立同分布需求和有状态动态（包括易腐烂物品）的问题，也具有可证明的保证性能。我们考虑了我们所称的需求过程的非退化性假设，并认为它们是允许学习的必要条件。",
