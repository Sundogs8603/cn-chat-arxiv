    "translated_abstract": "现代计算增强了我们对社会相互作用如何塑造动物社会集体行为的理解。尽管分析模型在研究集体行为中占主导地位，但这项研究引入了一个深度学习模型来评估Hemigrammus rhodostomus鱼类的社会互动。我们将深度学习方法的结果与实验结果以及最先进的分析模型的结果进行比较。为此，我们提出了一种系统方法来评估集体运动模型的准确性，利用一组严格的个体和集体时空可观测量。我们证明了社会互动的机器学习模型可以直接与其分析对手竞争，以重现微妙的实验可观测量。此外，这项工作强调了在不同时间尺度上进行一致验证的必要性，并确定了使我们的深度学习模型具有竞争力的关键设计方面。",
