    "translated_abstract": "统一推理提供了一种通用的无分布方法，用于严格校准任何机器学习算法的新颖性检测输出。虽然这种方法有很多优点，但它也有随机性的限制，即在分析相同数据时可能会导致不同的结果，这可能会妨碍对任何发现的解释。我们提出通过利用适当的统一E-值而不是p-值来量化统计显著性，使统一推理更加稳定。这种解决方案允许有效地汇总对相同数据多次分析的证据，同时可靠地控制虚假发现率。此外，我们还展示了与标准统一推理相比，所提方法可以减少随机性而不会损失太多功率，部分原因是基于从相同数据中精心提取的附加辅助信息来加权统一E-值的创新方法。通过合成数据的模拟实验表明...",
