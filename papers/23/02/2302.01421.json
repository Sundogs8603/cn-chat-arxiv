    "abstract": "We propose an algorithm to solve a class of Stackelberg games (possibly with multiple followers) in a follower agnostic manner. Particularly, unlike other contemporary works, our algorithm does not require the use of an oracle estimator for the gradient of the leader's objective or knowledge about the follower's utility function or strategy space. Instead, we design two-loop algorithm where the leader updates its strategies using specially constructed gradient estimator obtained by probing followers with specially designed strategies. Upon receiving the followers engage in an adaptation rule such that the joint strategy of followers converges near equilibrium which is the only information observed by leader to construct the aforementioned gradient estimator. We provide non-asymptotic convergence rates to stationary points of the leader's objective in the absence of convexity of the closed-loop function and further show asymptotic convergence to a local minima of the leader's objective.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种算法，以追随者不可知的方式解决斯塔克贝格博弈的一类问题（可能有多个追随者）。与其他当代作品不同的是，我们的算法不需要使用领导者目标的梯度的预估器，也不需要了解追随者的效用函数或策略空间。相反，我们设计了一个两层循环算法，其中领导者使用通过用特别设计的策略探测追随者获得的特殊构造的梯度估计器更新其策略。在接收到这些策略后，追随者采用适应规则，使得追随者的联合策略收敛于均衡状态，这是领导者观察到的唯一信息，用于构造前述梯度估计器。我们提供了非渐进收敛速度到领导者目标的局部稳定点，尽管闭环函数不具有凸性。同时，我们进一步展示了对领导者目标的局部极小值的渐进收敛。",
