    "translated_abstract": "贫困地图是政府和非政府组织追踪社会经济变化并在需要的地区充分分配基础设施和服务的重要工具。传感器和在线众包数据与机器学习方法相结合最近在贫困地图推断方面取得了突破。然而，这些方法无法捕捉到地方财富波动，并且没有优化以产生可靠结果，以确保所有子人口的准确预测。在这里，我们提出了一个机器学习模型的管道，来推断多个地理集群人口地方的财富平均值和标准差，并举例说明了它们在塞拉利昂和乌干达的表现。这些模型利用了七个独立的和自由可用的特征源，基于卫星图像和通过在线众包和社交媒体收集的元数据。我们的模型表明，综合元数据特征是农村地区财富的最佳预测因素，优于基于图像的模态。此外，我们引入了一个新颖的“财富地平线”概念，明确地可视化了不同空间尺度下的财富分布。我们的方法可以帮助政策制定者更好地了解影响财富分布的潜在社会经济多样性，并优先考虑有针对性的干预措施。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a pipeline of machine learning models to infer the mean and standard deviation of wealth across multiple geographically clustered populated places, and introduces a novel concept of \"wealth horizons\" to explicitly visualize the wealth distribution under different spatial scales. The approach can help policymakers better understand the underlying sociodemographic diversity affecting wealth distribution, and prioritize targeted interventions."
