    "translated_abstract": "文本生成图像(TTIG)模型是创造性人工智能的最新补充。这些模型可根据文本描述生成图像，开始与专业创作者的作品竞争并引发了有关创作工作、失业和版权等重要影响的讨论。为了支持TTIG的可持续采用，我们必须提供专业人士感知、采用和使用TTIG的丰富、可靠和透明的见解。然而，公共辩论浅薄、狭窄且缺乏透明度，学术工作则集中于研究TTIG在一般艺术家人群中的使用，但没有研究特定行业的专业人士的感知和态度。在本文中，我们对芬兰游戏行业进行了一项定性的探索性访谈研究，研究了TTIG的应用。通过对14个游戏专业人士进行的半结构化访谈的模板分析，我们揭示了12个总体主题，结构化成49个子主题，探讨了TTIG的应用和认知等方面的问题。",
