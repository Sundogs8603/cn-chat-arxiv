    "translated_abstract": "为了设计和分析在生物、医学、材料、电子/光子设备等领域有广泛应用的量子纳米结构，需要进行多维直接数值模拟(Schr\\\"odinger方程)。在大型纳米结构中，由于自由度(DoF)非常高，进行DNS需要大量的计算工作，这可能是不可行的。本研究提出了一种基于第一原理的简化模型学习算法，用于模拟Schr\\\"odinger方程以实现高精度和高效率。所提出的模拟方法应用于研究两种量子点结构；一种在外部电场下运行，另一种受间断性边界条件下内部势能变化的影响。前者类似于纳米电子设备的典型操作，而后者则涉及到密度泛函理论的模拟和设计的纳米结构和材料应用。使用基于第一原理的简化模型学习算法，实现了对这两种量子点结构的准确且高效的模拟，证明了所提出方法的有效性。",
