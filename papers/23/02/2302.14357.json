We present a decoding beam search algorithm that batches the joint network calls across a segment of time steps, which results in 20%-96% decoding speedups consistently across all models and settings experimented with. In addition, aggregating emission probabilities over a segment may be seen as a better approximation to finding the most likely model output, causing our algorithm to improve oracle word error rate by up to 11% relative as the segment size increases, and to slightly improve general word error rate.",
