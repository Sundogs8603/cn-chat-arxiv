    "translated_abstract": "我们的目标是提出一种可审核、易于排查、准确估计治疗效应并可扩展到高维数据的观察性因果推断方法。我们描述了一个称为“模型匹配”的通用框架，通过以下步骤实现这些目标：（i）通过结果建模学习距离度量，（ii）使用距离度量创建匹配组，（iii）使用匹配组估计治疗效应。模型匹配使用变量重要性测量来构建距离度量，使其成为一个灵活的框架，可适应不同的应用场景。我们关注问题在潜在混淆变量数量上的可扩展性，使用LASSO将模型匹配框架操作化。我们在LASSO结果建模一致地识别出所有混淆变量的情况下推导性能保证（重要的是不要求线性模型正确规定）。我们还提供实验证明了方法的扩展性与准确性。",
