More specifically, we define a quantile-of-quantiles estimator and prove that for any distribution, it is possible to output prediction sets with desired coverage in only one round of communication. To mitigate privacy issues, we also describe a locally differentially private version of our estimator. Finally, over a wide range of experiments, we show that our method returns prediction sets with coverage and length very similar to those obtained in a centralized setting.

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种在一次性联邦学习设置下构建预测集的适应预测方法。具体而言，我们定义了一个分位数估计器，并证明对于任何分布，只需一轮通信即可输出具有期望覆盖率的预测集。为了解决隐私问题，我们还描述了一个本地差分隐私版本的估计器。最后，在广泛的实验中，我们表明我们的方法返回的预测集的覆盖率和长度非常类似于在集中式设置中获得的结果。总体而言，这些结果证明了我们的方法在一次性联邦学习设置下进行适应预测的适用性。",
