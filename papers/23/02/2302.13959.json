    "abstract": "Increasingly larger datasets have become a standard ingredient to advancing the state-of-the-art in NLP. However, data quality might have already become the bottleneck to unlock further gains. Given the diversity and the sizes of modern datasets, standard data filtering is not straight-forward to apply, because of the multifacetedness of the harmful data and elusiveness of filtering rules that would generalize across multiple tasks. We study the fitness of task-agnostic self-influence scores of training examples for data cleaning, analyze their efficacy in capturing naturally occurring outliers, and investigate to what extent self-influence based data cleaning can improve downstream performance in machine translation, question answering and text classification, building up on recent approaches to self-influence calculation and automated curriculum learning.",

    "translated_abstract": "在NLP领域，使用规模越来越大的数据集已成为推动最新技术发展的标准成分。然而，数据质量可能已成为解锁更大进展的瓶颈。由于现代数据集的多样性和规模，标准的数据过滤不容易应用，因为有害数据的多面性和过滤规则的隐晦性使其难以推广到多个任务。我们研究了训练样本的通用自我影响分数在数据清理中的适应性，分析了其捕捉自然异常值的功效，并研究了基于自我影响的数据清理在机器翻译、问答和文本分类等下游任务中对性能的改进程度。这些研究基于最近的自我影响计算和自动化课程学习方法。",
