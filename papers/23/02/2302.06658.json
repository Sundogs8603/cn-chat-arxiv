    "abstract": "Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is compelling because it allows adapting an off-the-shelf model to a new domain using only unlabelled data. In this work, we apply existing SFDA techniques to a challenging set of naturally-occurring distribution shifts in bioacoustics, which are very different from the ones commonly studied in computer vision. We find existing methods perform differently relative to each other than observed in vision benchmarks, and sometimes perform worse than no adaptation at all. We propose a new simple method which outperforms the existing methods on our new shifts while exhibiting strong performance on a range of vision datasets. Our findings suggest that existing SFDA methods are not as generalizable as previously thought and that considering diverse modalities can be a useful avenue for designing more robust models.",

    "translated_abstract": "无源域自适应（SFDA）很有吸引力，因为它允许使用未标记的数据将现成的模型适应到新领域。在这项研究中，我们将现有的SFDA技术应用于生物声学中一组具有挑战性的自然分布偏移，这些偏移与计算机视觉中通常研究的偏移非常不同。我们发现，现有的方法在相对排名上的表现与视觉基准中观察到的不同，并且有时比完全没有自适应表现更差。我们提出了一种新的简单方法，在我们的新偏移中表现优于现有方法，同时在一系列视觉数据集上表现出强大的性能。我们的发现表明，现有的SFDA方法并不像之前想象的那样具有通用性，并且考虑到不同的模态可以成为设计更强大模型的有用途径。",
