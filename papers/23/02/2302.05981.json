    "translated_abstract": "流程内容生成算法可以自动生成复杂数一致的环境。然而，使用流程内容生成方法生成反映特定意图和限制的有意义内容仍然具有挑战性。此外，许多流程内容生成算法缺乏以开放式方式生成内容的能力。最近，大型语言模型在许多不同领域都表现出了非常高的效率。这些训练有素的大型语言模型可以进行微调，重复使用信息并加速新任务的培训。在这项工作中，我们介绍了MarioGPT，这是一个经过优化的GPT2模型，用于生成基于瓷砖的游戏关卡，我们以超级马里奥兄弟的关卡为例。我们展示了MarioGPT不仅可以生成不同的游戏关卡，而且可以通过文本提示控制关卡生成，解决了当前PCG技术的主要挑战之一。据我们所知，MarioGPT是第一个文本到关卡模型。",
