    "translated_abstract": "生成式流网络（GFlowNets）是一种新的概率采样器系列，其中代理通过一系列决策步骤学习生成复杂组合结构的随机策略。尽管受强化学习启发，当前的GFlowNet框架在适用性上相对有限，无法处理奖励函数中的随机性。在这项工作中，我们采用分布式范式来处理GFlowNets，将每个流函数转化为一个分布，从而在训练过程中提供更多信息的学习信号。通过通过量化函数对每个边流进行参数化，我们提出的“量化匹配” GFlowNet学习算法能够学习风险敏感的策略，这是处理风险不确定性场景的基本组成部分。此外，我们发现与之前的方法相比，分布式方法由于我们增强的训练算法，可以在现有基准上实现显着改进。",
