    "translated_abstract": "预训练语言模型在许多自然语言处理任务中取得了最新的突破。然而，在主题建模方面，统计生成模型（如LDA）仍然普遍存在，而这些模型不容易融入上下文词向量。它们可能会生成与人类判断不一致的主题。本文提出了一种新颖的主题建模和推断算法。我们提出了一种句子包（BoS）的方法，以句子作为分析单位。通过结合生成过程模型和聚类，我们使用预训练的句子嵌入。我们基于期望最大化、硬分配和一个退火过程的快速推断算法。评估结果显示，我们的方法能以相对较小的计算需求获得最新的结果。与利用词嵌入的之前方法相比，我们的方法也更加灵活，因为它提供了使用先验自定义主题-文档分布的可能性。",
