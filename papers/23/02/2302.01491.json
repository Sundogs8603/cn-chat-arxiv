    "translated_abstract": "该论文介绍了一个在线规划器DiSProD，用于处理连续状态和动作空间中概率转移的环境。DiSProD建立一个符号图，捕捉未来轨迹的分布，基于给定的策略，使用独立假设和概率分布的近似传播。该符号图提供了策略价值的可微分表示，使得可以进行长时间搜索的高效梯度优化。近似分布的传播可以看作是许多轨迹的聚合，非常适合处理稀疏奖励和随机环境。通过在离散时间规划和实时控制机器人系统方面进行广泛的实验性评估，该论文将DiSProD与最先进的规划器进行了比较。所提出的方法在处理随机环境、对搜索深度的敏感性、奖励的稀疏性和大的动作空间方面比现有规划器有所提高。",
