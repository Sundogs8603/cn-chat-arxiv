    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习方法为聚类多元时间序列数据提供了一个很有前途的方向。然而，现实世界中的时间序列数据通常包含缺失值，而现有的方法要求在聚类之前填补缺失值，这可能会导致大量计算和噪声，从而导致无效的解释。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种基于自监督学习的用于聚类包含缺失值的多元时间序列数据的方法(SLAC-Time)。SLAC-Time是一种基于Transformer的聚类方法，它使用时间序列预测作为代理任务，利用无标签数据来学习更健壮的时间序列表示。该方法同时学习神经网络参数和所学表示的聚类分配。它使用K-means方法迭代地对学习表示进行聚类，然后利用随后的聚类分配作为伪标签来更新模型参数。",
