    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型在许多任务中展示了强大的生成能力，具有作为离线强化学习范例的潜力。然而，扩散模型的质量受到训练数据不足的限制，这阻碍了规划的性能和对新任务的泛化能力。本文介绍了AdaptDiffuser，一种带有扩散的进化规划方法，可以自我进化以改进扩散模型，从而获得更好的规划器，不仅适用于已知任务，而且还可以适应未知任务。AdaptDiffuser使用奖励梯度的指导生成富有丰富的目标条件任务的合成专家数据。然后通过鉴别器选择高质量数据来微调扩散模型，从而改善对未知任务的泛化能力。在两个基准环境以及 KUKA 工业机器人臂和 Maze2D 环境中对两个精心设计的未知任务进行的实证实验表明，该方法在性能上具有优势。",
