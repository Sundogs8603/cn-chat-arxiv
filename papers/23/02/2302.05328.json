    "translated_abstract": "尽管协同过滤(collaborative filtering, CF)模型取得了巨大的成功，但由于流行度分布的变化在现实世界中普遍且不可避免，因此这些模型存在严重的性能下降问题。不幸的是，大多数主流的消除流行度偏见的策略需要事先知道测试分布，以确定偏见程度并进一步学习与流行度纠缠在一起的表示来减轻偏见。因此，这些模型在目标测试集中表现出明显的性能提升，但在不知道流行度分布的情况下，却会大大偏离用户真正的兴趣推荐。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的学习框架，不变的协同过滤(InvCF)，用于发现能够忠实地揭示潜在偏好和流行度语义的解耦表示，而不需要对测试分布做出任何假设。",
