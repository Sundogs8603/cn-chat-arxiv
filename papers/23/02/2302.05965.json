This paper proposes a ranking-enhanced encoding and skeleton-aware decoding framework to decouple the schema linking and the skeleton parsing. Specifically, for a seq2seq encoder-decode model, its encoder is injected by the most relevant schema items instead of the whole unordered ones, which could alleviate the schema linking effort during SQL parsing, and its decoder first generates the skeleton and then the actual SQL query, which could implicitly constrain the SQL parsing.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，预训练语言模型是文本到SQL中的最佳尝试之一。由于SQL查询的结构属性，seq2seq模型负责解析架构项（即表格和列）和骨架（即SQL关键字）。这些耦合的目标增加了正确解析SQL查询的困难，特别是当它们涉及许多架构项和逻辑操作符时。本文提出了一种排名增强的编码和骨架感知解码框架，以解耦架构连接和骨架解析。具体而言，对于seq2seq编码器-解码器模型，其编码器注入最相关的架构项，而不是整个无序的架构项，可以减轻SQL解析中的架构连接工作，而其解码器首先生成骨架，然后生成实际的SQL查询，可以隐式地限制SQL解析。我们在Spider及其三个鲁棒性变体：Spider-DK, Spider-EMNLP19和Spider-WTq等SQL数据集上评估了我们提出的框架。",
