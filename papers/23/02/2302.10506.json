    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了基于图结构的结构化节点分类问题，其中节点标签之间存在依赖关系。特别地，我们集中研究了部分标记图的分类问题，需要将已知标记的信息纳入未知标签的预测中。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的框架，利用扩散概率模型进行结构化节点分类(DPM-SNC)。我们的框架的核心是DPM-SNC的出色能力，即(a)使用具有表达性的反向扩散过程学习标签的联合分布，(b)利用流形约束的采样方法在已知标签的条件下进行预测。由于DPMs缺乏部分标记数据的训练算法，因此我们设计了一种新的训练算法，应用DPMs，最大化一个新的变分下界。我们还从理论上分析了如何通过增强GNN的表达能力来提高DPMs对节点分类的效果。",
