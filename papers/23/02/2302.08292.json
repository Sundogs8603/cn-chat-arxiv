    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶感知目前严重依赖于基于深度学习的体系结构，需要大规模注释的数据集，具有相应的策划与标注成本。三维语义数据对于核心感知任务如障碍检测和自我定位非常有用。我们提出了一个新的数据集Navya3DSeg，具有多样的标签空间，对应于大规模生产级操作领域，包括来自13个国家的城市，乡村，工业区和大学。它包含23个带标签序列和25个没有标签的补充序列，旨在探讨基于点云的自监督和半监督语义分割基准。我们还提出了一种基于迭代多标签分层的顺序数据集拆分生成的新方法，并演示了比SemanticKITTI数据集提出的原始拆分+1.2％ mIoU的改进。这是一个完整的语义分割基准。",
