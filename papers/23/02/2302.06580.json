    "abstract": "We explore a model of duopolistic competition in which consumers learn about the fit of each competitor's product. In equilibrium, consumers comparison shop: they learn only about the relative values of the products. When information is cheap, increasing the cost of information decreases consumer welfare; but when information is expensive, this relationship flips. As information frictions vanish, there is a limiting equilibrium that is ex post efficient.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种双头垄断竞争的模型，其中消费者了解每个竞争对手的产品的适应性。在均衡中，消费者进行比较购物：他们只学习产品的相对价值。当信息便宜时，增加信息的成本会降低消费者福利；但当信息昂贵时，这种关系会反转。当信息摩擦消失时，存在一个极限均衡，该均衡在 ex post 时是有效的。",
    "tldr": "本研究探索了双头垄断市场中的比较购物行为，发现当信息成本较低时，增加信息成本会降低消费者福利；但当信息成本较高时，却会提高消费者福利，在信息摩擦消失时存在有效均衡。",
