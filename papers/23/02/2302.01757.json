    "translated_abstract": "随机平滑是构建具有认证鲁棒性的分类器的主要方法。现有的随机平滑方法主要针对具有连续输入（如图像）的分类器，其中常常研究$\\ell_p$范数受限的对抗性示例。然而，对于具有离散或可变大小输入（例如源代码）的分类器的研究较少，这些分类器需要不同的威胁模型和平滑机制。在本研究中，我们修改了随机平滑方法，以适用于离散序列分类器，以提供针对编辑距离受限的对抗性的可证明的鲁棒性。我们提出的平滑机制随机删除（RS-Del）应用了随机删除编辑，这种方式（也许令人惊讶地）足以提供针对对抗性删除、插入和替换编辑的鲁棒性。我们的认证证明不同于传统的Neyman-Pearson方法，在我们的情况下无法计算，而是围绕着另一种方式进行组织。",
