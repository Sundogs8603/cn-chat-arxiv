    "translated_abstract": "在线变点检测旨在实时检测高频数据流中的异常和变化，有时候带有有限的计算资源。这是一个重要的任务，根源于许多现实应用，包括但不限于网络安全、医学和天体物理学。虽然最近引入了快速高效的在线算法，但这些算法都依赖于常被在实际应用中违反的参数假设。受电信领域数据流的启发，我们构建了一种灵活的非参数方法来检测序列分布中的变化。我们的方法，NP-FOCuS，在数据的经验累积密度函数的一组点上构建了一个序列似然比检验，用于检测变化。通过跟踪超出或低于这些点的观测次数，实现了这一目标。由于功能修剪的思想，NP-FOCuS的计算成本与观测次数的对数成线性关系。",
