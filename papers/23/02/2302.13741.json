    "translated_abstract": "大型深度学习模型在各种应用中均表现出极大的潜力，然而模型的训练过程由于参数数量会极大，通常有数千亿个参数，因此训练变得非常具有挑战性。常见的分布式训练方法，如数据并行、张量并行和流水线并行，需要在整个过程中进行大量数据通信，导致在物理上分布的远程系统中一些机器的等待时间变得很长。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新型解决方案，称为 Hulk，它利用改进后的图神经网络来优化分布式计算系统。Hulk 不仅可以优化不同国家甚至同一个城市内不同区域之间的数据通信效率，而且还可以提供模型的最佳分布式部署。例如，它可以将某些层放在特定区域的机器上或传递特定的参数。",
