    "translated_abstract": "从文本中发现知识库（KB）外的实体提及，在KB维护中起着至关重要的作用，但并未被完全开发。当前的方法主要局限于简单的基于阈值的方法和基于特征的分类，并且用于评估的数据集相对较少。本文提出了BLINKout，一种新的基于BERT的实体链接（EL）方法，可以通过将提及与特殊的NIL实体进行匹配来识别没有相应KB实体的提及。为了更好地利用BERT，我们提出了包括NIL实体表示和分类在内的新技术，并增强了其同义词。我们还提出了KB修剪和版本控制策略，以自动从常见的KB EL数据集构建出KB外的数据集。在医学本体论、UMLS、SNOMED CT等五个不同领域中，对临床笔记、生物医学出版物和维基百科文章的结果表明，BLINKout在识别知识库外提及方面优于现有方法。",
