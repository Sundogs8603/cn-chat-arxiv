    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised, graph-based filter feature selection technique which exploits the power of topologically constrained network representations. We model dependency structures among features using a family of chordal graphs (the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph), and we maximise the likelihood of features' relevance by studying their relative position inside the network. Such an approach presents three aspects that are particularly satisfactory compared to its alternatives: (i) it is highly tunable and easily adaptable to the nature of input data; (ii) it is fully explainable, maintaining, at the same time, a remarkable level of simplicity; (iii) it is computationally cheaper compared to its alternatives. We test our algorithm on 16 benchmark datasets from different applicative domains showing that it outperforms or matches the current state-of-the-art under heterogeneous evaluation conditions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新型的无监督的基于图论过滤方法进行特征选择的技术，利用了拓扑约束网络表示的威力。我们使用一系列弦图（三角最大过滤图）模拟特征之间的相互依赖关系，并通过研究特征在网络内的相对位置来最大化特征相关性的可能性。这种方法相对于其他方法有三个特点：（i）高度可调，易于适应输入数据的性质；（ii）完全可解释，同时保持了显著的简单性；（iii）计算成本比其替代方案更加便宜。我们在来自不同应用领域的16个基准数据集上测试了我们的算法，结果表明在异构评估条件下，它优于或与当前最先进技术相匹配。",
