    "translated_abstract": "由于大规模带注释的体积医学图像的获取成本高昂，因此自监督学习（SSL）为许多下游任务提供了一种有前途的预训练和特征提取解决方案，因为它仅使用未标记数据。最近，基于实例区分的SSL方法在医学成像领域变得流行。然而，SSL预训练编码器可能使用许多图像线索来区分一个实例，而这些线索不一定与疾病相关。此外，病理模式常常很微妙和异质，需要所需方法能够表示对不同身体部位中的异常变化敏感的解剖特异性特征。本文提出了一个名为DrasCLR的新的SSL框架，用于三维医学成像，以克服这些挑战。我们提出了两种领域特定的对比学习策略：一种旨在捕捉局部解剖区域内微妙疾病模式，另一种旨在识别具有不同挑战性的解剖区域间的疾病相关特征。",
