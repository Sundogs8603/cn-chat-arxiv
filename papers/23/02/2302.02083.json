Its most recent version, GPT-3.5 (\"davinci-003\"; November 2022), solved 90% of false-belief tasks, at the level of seven-year-olds. GPT-4 published in March 2023 solved nearly all the tasks (95%).

    "translated_abstract": "“心智理论（ToM）指能够推理他人内心的不可观察状态，对于人类社交互动、交流、移情、自我意识和道德至关重要。我们使用了40个广泛用于测试人类ToM的经典虚假信念任务来测试几个语言模型。2020年之前发布的模型在解决ToM任务方面几乎没有能力。然而，2020年5月发布的第一个GPT-3版本（“davinci-001”）解决了约40％的虚假信念任务，与3.5岁的儿童的表现相当。它的第二个版本（“davinci-002”，2022年1月）解决了70％的虚假信念任务，与6岁儿童的表现相当。最新版本的GPT-3.5（“davinci-003”，2022年11月）解决了90％的虚假信念任务，达到了7岁儿童水平。于2023年3月发布的GPT-4解决了几乎所有的任务（95％）。这些发现表明，类似ToM的能力（迄今被认为是人类独有的）可能是语言的附带产物。”",
