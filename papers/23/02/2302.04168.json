    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于神经网络的波函数在建模从头算基态势能曲面方面取得了最新的状态-of-the-art精度。然而，这些网络只能解决相同原子组的不同空间排列。为了克服这个限制，我们提出了一种名为“图学习轨道嵌入(Globe)”的神经网络重新参数化方法，可以将神经波函数适应于不同的分子。Globe通过连接分子轨道和共价键以实现空间信息传递，学习局部电子结构的表示形式，从而可以在分子之间泛化。此外，我们提出了一个大小一致的波函数Ansatz，分子轨道网络(Moon)，专门用于联合求解不同分子的Schrödinger方程。在我们的实验中，我们发现Moon在4.5倍的迭代步数内即可收敛于以前的方法相似的精度，或在相同的时间内给出更低的能量。进一步分析表明，Moon的能量估算具有可加性。",
