    "abstract": "In a model of interconnected conflicts on a network, we compare the equilibrium effort profiles and payoffs under two scenarios: uniform effort (UE) in which each contestant is restricted to exert the same effort across all the battles she participates, and discriminatory effort (DE) in which such a restriction is lifted. When the contest technology in each battle is of Tullock form, a surprising neutrality result holds within the class of semi-symmetric conflict network structures: both the aggregate actions and equilibrium payoffs under two regimes are the same. We also show that, in some sense, the Tullock form is necessary for such a neutrality result. Moving beyond the Tullock family, we further demonstrate how the curvature of contest technology shapes the welfare and effort effects.",

    "translated_abstract": "在一个网络上互连的冲突模型中，我们比较了两种情况下的均衡努力和回报：统一努力（UE）中每个参与者在所有战斗中都限制于施加相同的努力，和歧视性努力（DE）中这种限制被解除。当每场战斗中的竞争技术属于 Tullock 形式时，在半对称冲突网络结构的类中，存在一个令人惊讶的中立结果：两种制度下的总行动和均衡回报是一样的。我们还证明，在某种意义上，Tullock形式对于这样的中立结果是必要的。在超越 Tullock 家族的范围内，我们进一步展示竞争技术曲率如何影响福利和努力效果。",
