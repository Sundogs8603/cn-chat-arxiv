Focusing on the public acceptance behavior of AVs, this empirical study addresses two gaps in the plethora of travel behavior research on identifying the potential determinants thereof. First, a clear behavioral understanding is lacking as to the perceived concern about AV safety and the consequent effect on AV acceptance behavior.

    "translated_abstract": "随着下一代自动化移动生态系统的前景，实现争议中的交通效率和安全效益取决于对自动驾驶车辆（AVs）的需求情景。本实证研究聚焦于AVs的公众接受行为，解决了旅行行为研究领域存在的两个差距。首先，缺乏对于AV安全关切的行为理解以及其对AV接受行为的影响。其次，人们如何评估提升的自动化移动性能够满足他们当前（AV时代之前）的出行行为和需求，并且对AV接受度和感知安全关切产生的影响尚不明确。为了填补这些差距，我们使用了递归三变量计量模型，该模型共同估计AV接受度（有序），感知AV安全关切（有序）和当前年度车辆行程（连续）。",
