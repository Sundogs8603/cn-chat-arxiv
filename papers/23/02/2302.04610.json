    "translated_abstract": "Gromov-Wasserstein（GW）距离是一种在不同度量空间上比较和对齐概率分布的强大工具。最近，GW已成为广泛应用于图学习任务中对齐异构数据的主要建模技术。然而，已知GW距离对异常值非常敏感，如果在目标函数中将异常值与其他样本赋予相同的权重，可能会导致较大的不准确性。为了缓解这个问题，我们引入了一种新的、稳健的GW距离称为RGW。RGW在基于Kullback-Leibler散度的模糊集合中引入了乐观扰动的边际约束。为了更方便地在实践中使用RGW的好处，我们利用Bregman近端交替线性化最小化算法开发了一个计算高效且理论可证的过程。通过大量实验证实了我们的理论结果，并展示了RGW的有效性。",
