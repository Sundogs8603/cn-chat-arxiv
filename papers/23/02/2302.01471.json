    "translated_abstract": "随着各种技术的发展，元宇宙正在崛起。虚拟现实技术是元宇宙中虚拟宇宙的支撑，能够为用户带来高度沉浸式的体验。在元宇宙中，移动性备受强调，虚拟现实设备通过减少本地的计算能力来减轻重量。针对元宇宙服务器和多个虚拟现实用户的系统，本文考虑了两种情况：（i）服务器生成帧并将它们传输给用户；（ii）用户在本地生成帧，因此耗费设备能量。此外，在元宇宙中的多用户虚拟现实场景中，用户对于帧率有不同的特点和需求。因此，我们联合优化服务器向用户下行通信的信道访问安排（包括帧生成位置的决策）和传输功率来提高用户的效用。这个联合优化问题被形式化为一个用户中心异构行动深度强化学习（UCHA-DRL）问题，并采用一种新的Q网络体系结构，称为异构行动Q网络（HAQN）来求解。仿真结果表明，我们提出的UCHA-DRL算法在收敛速度、用户切换次数和用户平均帧率方面优于传统的Q学习算法和深度Q网络（DQN）算法。",
