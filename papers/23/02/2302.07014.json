    "abstract": "Due to the precautionary measures during the COVID-19 pandemic many universities offered unproctored take-home exams. We propose methods to detect potential collusion between students and apply our approach on event log data from take-home exams during the pandemic. We find groups of students with suspiciously similar exams. In addition, we compare our findings to a proctored control group. By this, we establish a rule of thumb for evaluating which cases are \"outstandingly similar\", i.e., suspicious cases.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于COVID-19疫情期间的预防性措施，许多大学提供了无监考的远程考试。我们提出了检测学生间可能的串通的方法，并将其应用于疫情期间远程考试的事件日志数据中。我们发现了一些有着明显相似考试的学生群体，同时将我们的发现与被监考控制组的结果进行了比较。基于这些，我们建立了一个评估“极其相似”的异常案例的经验规则。",
