    "abstract": "Generative AI models have shown impressive ability to produce images with text prompts, which could benefit creativity in visual art creation and self-expression. However, it is unclear how precisely the generated images express contexts and emotions from the input texts. We explored the emotional expressiveness of AI-generated images and developed RePrompt, an automatic method to refine text prompts toward precise expression of the generated images. Inspired by crowdsourced editing strategies, we curated intuitive text features, such as the number and concreteness of nouns, and trained a proxy model to analyze the feature effects on the AI-generated image. With model explanations of the proxy model, we curated a rubric to adjust text prompts to optimize image generation for precise emotion expression. We conducted simulation and user studies, which showed that RePrompt significantly improves the emotional expressiveness of AI-generated images, especially for negative emotions.",

    "translated_abstract": "生成式AI模型已经展示出通过文本提示产生图像的惊人能力，这可以使视觉艺术创作和自我表达方面受益。然而，目前还不清楚生成的图像如何精确地表达输入文本的情境和情感。本文探讨了AI生成图像的情感表现力，并开发了一个自动方法RePrompt，以精确表达生成的图像为目标来完善文本提示。受到众包编辑策略的启发，我们策划了直观的文本特征，例如名词的数量和具体性，并训练了一个代理模型来分析这些特征对AI生成图像的影响。通过代理模型的解释，我们策划了一个准则来调整文本提示，从而优化生成的图像以精确表达情感。我们进行了模拟和用户研究，结果表明RePrompt显著提高了AI生成图像的情感表现力，尤其是负面情感方面。",
