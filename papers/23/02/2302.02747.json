    "translated_abstract": "在许多金融机构、中央银行和国际组织中，跨多个预测时段的分位数预测已成为重要的输出。本文提出了一种针对这种分位数预测的错误规范检验，该检验评估多个预测时段和/或分位数下的优化性。该检验建立在多个Mincer-Zarnowitz分位数回归基础上，采用矩等式框架。我们的主要检验是针对自动校准的零假设，这一概念评估了预测本身所包含的信息。我们提供了一种扩展，可以测试相对较大的信息集和多元扩展的优化性。重要的是，我们的测试不仅可以提供有关优化性的一般违反情况的信息，还可以提供有关特定形式的次优性的有用洞见。模拟研究调查了我们的测试的有限样本性能，以及两个对金融收益的实证应用。",
