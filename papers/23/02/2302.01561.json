    "translated_abstract": "过程生成内容（PCG）是一个不断发展的领域，具有在视频游戏行业中的广泛应用和以较低成本创建更好游戏的巨大潜力。然而，PCG的大部分工作集中在生成相对简单的游戏中的关卡，因为设计可优化的目标函数对于复杂环境来说具有挑战性。这限制了PCG在更复杂和现代化的游戏中的适用性，阻碍了其在工业界的应用。我们的工作旨在通过引入一个组成层级生成方法来解决这个限制，该方法递归地组成简单的低级生成器以构建大型和复杂的创造物。这种方法可以轻松优化目标，并通过引用较低级别组件来以可解释的方式设计复杂结构。我们经验性地证明我们的方法优于非组合基准线，更准确地满足设计师的功能需求。",
