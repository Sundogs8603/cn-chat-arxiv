    "abstract": "arXiv:2302.06670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization of visual data, including images and videos, are of great significance in both machine learning academia and applied real-world scenarios. Despite the rapid development of visual anomaly detection techniques in recent years, the interpretations of these black-box models and reasonable explanations of why anomalies can be distinguished out are scarce. This paper provides the first survey concentrated on explainable visual anomaly detection methods. We first introduce the basic background of image-level and video-level anomaly detection. Then, as the main content of this survey, a comprehensive and exhaustive literature review of explainable anomaly detection methods for both images and videos is presented. Next, we analyze why some explainable anomaly detection methods can be applied to both images and videos and why others can be only applied to one modality. Additionally, we provide summaries",

    "translated_abstract": "异常检测和定位视觉数据（包括图像和视频）在机器学习学术界和应用实际场景中具有重要意义。尽管近年来可视异常检测技术迅速发展，但对于这些黑盒模型的解释以及为何可以区分异常的合理解释却十分稀缺。本文首次提供了一项集中于可解释视觉异常检测方法的调研。我们首先介绍了图像级和视频级异常检测的基本背景。然后，作为本调研的主要内容，我们展示了针对图像和视频的可解释异常检测方法的全面和详尽的文献综述。接下来，我们分析了为什么一些可解释异常检测方法可以应用于图像和视频，而另一些则只能应用于一种模态。此外，我们提供了总结",
