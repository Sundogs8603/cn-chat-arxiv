    "translated_abstract": "随机梯度下降（SGD）是一种可扩展且内存效率高的优化算法，适用于大型数据集和流式数据的处理，因此受到了广泛关注和欢迎。SGD 基于的估计器在统计推断中的应用，如区间估计，也取得了巨大成功。然而，大多数相关工作都是基于独立同分布观测或马尔可夫链的。当观测数据来自一个混合时间序列时，如何进行有效的统计推断尚未研究。事实上，观测数据之间的一般相关性给区间估计带来了挑战。大多数现有方法可能会忽略这种相关性并导致无效的置信区间。本文提出了一种基于 mini-batch SGD 估计器进行 $\\varphi$-混合数据统计推断的方法。置信区间是使用相关的 mini-batch bootstrap SGD 程序构建的。通过使用 \\cite{yu1994rates} 中的 “独立块” 技巧，我们证明了该方法的有效性。",
