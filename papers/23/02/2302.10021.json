    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly changed the standards and affected all aspects of our lives, especially social communication. It has forced people to extensively wear medical face masks, in order to prevent transmission. This face occlusion can strongly irritate emotional reading from the face and urges us to incorporate the whole body as an emotional cue. In this paper, we conduct insightful studies about the effect of face occlusion on emotion recognition performance, and showcase the superiority of full body input over the plain masked face. We utilize a deep learning model based on the Temporal Segment Network framework, and aspire to fully overcome the face mask consequences. Although facial and bodily features can be learned from a single input, this may lead to irrelevant information confusion. By processing those features separately and fusing their prediction scores, we are more effectively taking advantage of both modalities. This framework also naturally supports tempo",

    "translated_abstract": "新冠肺炎疫情无疑改变了我们生活的标准和影响了社交通讯的方方面面。为了预防传播，人们被迫广泛佩戴医用口罩，这种面部遮挡严重影响了从面部读取情感的能力，促使我们将整个身体视为情感线索。本文通过深入研究面部遮挡对情感识别表现的影响，展示了整体人体输入优于单纯面部遮挡的卓越性。我们利用基于时间分段网络框架的深度学习模型，并渴望完全克服口罩带来的后果。虽然面部和身体特征可以从单个输入中学习，但这可能导致无关信息混淆。通过分别处理这些特征并融合它们的预测分数，我们更有效地利用了两种模式。该框架还自然地支持节奏的推断，从而克服了与语音相关的复杂性和多度量问题。",
