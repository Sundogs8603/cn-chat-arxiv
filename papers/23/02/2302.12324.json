    "translated_abstract": "良好的插图标题可以帮助论文读者理解复杂的科学图表。然而，即使是已发表的论文，其标题常常写得很差。自动生成标题可以帮助论文作者提供良好的起始标题，以便进一步改进质量。之前的工作常将插图标题生成视为一项视觉到语言的任务。本文中，我们表明将其作为科学文献中的文本摘要任务更为有效。我们对预训练的抽象化摘要模型 PEGASUS 进行了微调，专门用于将引用图表的段落（例如，“图3显示...”）摘要为图表标题。在大规模 arXiv 图表上进行的实验表明，我们的方法在自动评估和人工评估中均优于之前的视觉方法。我们还进行了深入的研究，重点关注两个关键挑战：(i) 低质量作者撰写的标题的普遍存在以及 (ii) 对好标题缺乏明确的标准。我们提供了代码",
