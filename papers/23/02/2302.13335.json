    "translated_abstract": "模仿学习解决了通过观察专家演示而没有访问环境奖励信号的学习挑战。大多数现有的不需要与环境交互的模仿学习方法，要么将专家分布建模为条件概率p(a|s)（例如，行为克隆，BC），要么将联合概率p(s,a)建模（例如，隐式行为克隆）。尽管行为克隆对于建模条件概率的简单性，但通常难以泛化。虽然对联合概率进行建模可以提高泛化性能，但推理过程可能耗时，并且往往会遭受流形过拟合的问题。本文提出了一个模仿学习框架，它从建模专家分布的条件和联合概率中受益。我们提出的扩散模型增强的行为克隆（DBC）采用训练有素的扩散模型来建模专家行为，并学习一种策略以最大化根据混合概率分布采样的回报。",
