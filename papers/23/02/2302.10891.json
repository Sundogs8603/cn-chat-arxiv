    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了$\\Psi$-GNN，一种新颖的图神经网络（GNN）方法，用于解决具有混合边界条件的普遍泊松PDE问题。通过利用隐式层理论，$\\Psi$-GNN建模了一个“无限”深的网络，从而避免了经验调整所需的消息传递层次以获得解决方案。其原始架构明确考虑了边界条件，这是物理应用的关键前提，并且能够适应任何最初提供的解决方案。 $\\Psi$-GNN使用“物理信息”损失进行训练，训练过程由设计稳定，并对其初始化不敏感。此外，该方法的一致性在理论上得到了证明，并且其柔韧性和泛化效率在实验中得到了证明：相同的学习模型可以准确处理各种尺寸和不同边界条件的非结构化网格。",
