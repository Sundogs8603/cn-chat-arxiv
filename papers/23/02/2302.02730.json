    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了Wang等人最近提出的一阶逻辑采样问题——如何高效地在有限域上采样给定一阶句子的模型？我们将他们针对双变量逻辑$\\mathbf{FO}^2$（$\\mathbf{UFO}^2$）的全称量化子片段的结果推广到了整个$\\mathbf{FO}^2$片段。具体而言，我们证明了$\\mathbf{FO}^2$在采样时具有域提升性，这意味着存在一个在域大小为多项式时间内运行的$\\mathbf{FO}^2$采样算法。我们进一步展示，即使存在计数约束，如对于某些量词自由的公式$\\varphi(x,y)$的$\\forall x\\exists_{=k} y: \\varphi(x,y)$和$\\exists_{=k} x\\forall y: \\varphi(x,y)$，我们的结果仍然成立。我们提出的方法是建设性的，得到的采样算法可以在包括组合结构的均匀生成和统计采样在内的各个领域中得到应用。",
