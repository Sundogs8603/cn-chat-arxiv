    "translated_abstract": "扩散概率模型(DPMs)在高分辨率图像合成方面表现出非常有希望的能力。然而，由于对去噪网络的多次评估，从预训练的DPM中进行采样非常耗时，因此加速DPM采样变得越来越重要。虽然设计出了快速采样器的最新进展，但现有方法仍无法在许多应用中生成令人满意的图像，这些应用更青睐于较少的步骤(如<10)。在本文中，我们开发了一种统一修正器(UniC)，它可以在任何现有的DPM采样器之后应用，提高精确度的阶数而无需额外的模型评估，并推导出一个支持任意阶数的统一预测器(UniP)作为副产品。通过结合UniP和UniC，我们提出了一种称为UniPC的统一预测-修正框架，用于快速采样DPMs，它具有任意阶数的统一解析形式，并且可以显著提高采样的质量，特别是在极端情况下。",
