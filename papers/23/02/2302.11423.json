    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种构建基于盈利率的新金融价格过程的公式。我们认为推动价格$P$的关键变量是盈利率$ \\gamma \\simeq  1/P $，是等效永续债券的到期收益率。我们用实时的$\\gamma$以 Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR)模型的形式进行了说明，这使得我们可以推导出许多金融价格和回报的特征，如回报的幂律分布，短暂的超指数泡沫行为，泡沫破灭之前价格的厚尾分布。我们的模型对于理解过量波动和权益溢价谜团有了新的解释。 我们使用基于L-BFGS-B优化算法的拟极大似然方法，通过对美国和中国股票市场五个著名历史泡沫的校准进行了加入$\\phi$ -散度统计数据的实证分析。",
