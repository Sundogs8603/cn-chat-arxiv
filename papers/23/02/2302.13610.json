    "abstract": "Few-shot named entity recognition (NER) aims at identifying named entities based on only few labeled instances. Most existing prototype-based sequence labeling models tend to memorize entity mentions which would be easily confused by close prototypes. In this paper, we proposed a Prototypical Semantic Decoupling method via joint Contrastive learning (PSDC) for few-shot NER. Specifically, we decouple class-specific prototypes and contextual semantic prototypes by two masking strategies to lead the model to focus on two different semantic information for inference. Besides, we further introduce joint contrastive learning objectives to better integrate two kinds of decoupling information and prevent semantic collapse. Experimental results on two few-shot NER benchmarks demonstrate that PSDC consistently outperforms the previous SOTA methods in terms of overall performance. Extensive analysis further validates the effectiveness and generalization of PSDC.",

    "translated_abstract": "少样本命名实体识别旨在基于极少量标注实例的情况下，识别出命名实体。大多数现有的基于原型的序列标注模型倾向于记忆实体提及，但这容易被相似的原型所混淆。本文提出了一种基于联合对比学习的原型语义解耦方法(PSDC)用于少样本命名实体识别。我们通过两种屏蔽策略来解耦类特定的原型和语境语义原型，以引导模型专注于推断的两种不同语义信息。此外，我们进一步引入联合对比学习目标来更好地整合两种解耦信息，并防止语义坍塌。在两个少样本NER基准测试上的实验结果表明，PSDC在整体性能方面一致优于以前的SOTA方法。广泛的分析进一步验证了PSDC的有效性和普适性。",
