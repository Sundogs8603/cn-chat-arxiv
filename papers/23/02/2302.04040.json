    "translated_abstract": "许多关键的科学问题涉及设计具有所需属性的新型分子，这可以被形式化为在离散化的化学空间上的黑盒优化问题。在实践中，多个冲突的目标和昂贵的评估（例如湿实验）使得候选人的多样性至关重要。计算方法已经取得了初步的成功，但仍然在同时考虑目标和搜索空间的多样性方面存在困难。为了填补这个空白，我们提出了一种多目标贝叶斯优化（MOBO）算法，利用基于超网络的GFlowNets（HN-GFN）作为收益函数优化器，目的是从近似帕累托前沿中采样出多样化的候选分子图。使用单一的条件化超网络，HN-GFN学习探索各个目标之间的各种折中。我们进一步提出了一种类似于事后认识的离线策略，以便在不同偏好之间共享高性能分子，以加快速度。",
