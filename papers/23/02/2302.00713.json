    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel interpretation of the so-called Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) distance, introduced by Chen et al. (2022), using concepts from stochastic processes. The WL distance aims at comparing graphs with node features, has the same discriminative power as the classic Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test and has deep connections to the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. This new interpretation connects the WL distance to the literature on distances for stochastic processes, which also makes the interpretation of the distance more accessible and intuitive. We further explore the connections between the WL distance and certain Message Passing Neural Networks, and discuss the implications of the WL distance for understanding the Lipschitz property and the universal approximation results for these networks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过使用随机过程的概念，对Chen等人（2022年）提出的所谓的Weisfeiler-Lehman（WL）距离进行了新颖的解释。WL距离旨在比较具有节点特征的图形，具有与经典的Weisfeiler-Lehman图同构测试相同的判别能力，并与Gromov-Wasserstein距离有着深入的联系。这种新的解释将WL距离与用于随机过程距离的文献联系起来，从而使得对距离的解释更加简洁易懂。我们进一步探讨了WL距离与某些消息传递神经网络之间的联系，并讨论了WL距离对于理解这些网络的Lipschitz性质和通用逼近结果的影响。",
