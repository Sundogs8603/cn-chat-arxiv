    "abstract": "Using the peer-exposure ratio, we explore the factor exposure heterogeneity in green and brown stocks. By looking at peer groups of S&P 500 index firms over 2014-2020 based on their greenhouse gas emission levels, we find that, on average, green stocks exhibit less factor exposure heterogeneity than brown stocks for most of the traditional equity factors but the value factor. Hence, investment managers shifting their investments from brown stocks to green stocks have less room to differentiate themselves regarding their factor exposures. Finally, we find that factor exposure heterogeneity has increased for green stocks compared to earlier periods.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文使用同行暴露比率，探讨了绿色股票和褐色股票中的因子暴露异质性。通过观察基于温室气体排放水平对S&P 500指数公司的同行群体，我们发现，平均而言，绿色股票在大多数传统股票因子（价值风格除外）上比褐色股票表现出更少的因子暴露异质性。因此，投资经理将投资从褐色股票转为绿色股票时，关于他们的因子暴露，他们的差异空间较小。最后，我们发现，与较早时期相比，绿色股票的因子暴露异质性增加了。",
