    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种称为对齐神经主题模型（ANTM）的动态主题模型算法家族，它结合了新颖的数据挖掘算法，提供了一个模块化框架，用于发现演变的主题。ANTM利用先进的预训练大型语言模型从文档中提取时间感知特征，并使用重叠滑动窗口算法进行顺序文档聚类，从而维护了演变主题的时间连续性。这种重叠滑动窗口算法在每个时间框架内标识不同数量的主题，并在时间段内对语义相似的文档聚类进行对齐。这个过程捕捉了不同时期出现和消退的趋势，并允许更具可解释性的演变主题表示。针对四个不同数据集的实验表明，ANTM在主题连贯性和多样性指标方面优于概率动态主题模型。此外，它改善了动态主题建模的可扩展性和灵活性。",
