    "translated_abstract": "本文致力于解决深度强化学习模型在频率和功率分配方面的泛化能力。现有的大部分方法解决强化学习无线问题在特定的预设的无线网络场景中。训练代理的性能通常非常特定于网络，并在用于不同的网络操作场景（例如，大小、邻域和移动性等）时变差。我们展示了我们的方法如何增强训练，以在恶意干扰环境下通过分布式多智能体方式部署模型进行推理时提高其泛化能力。通过这些，我们证明了所提出的方法在不同大小和结构的先前未见过的仿真无线网络上测试时的改进训练和推理性能。更重要的是，为了证明实际影响，端到端解决方案已实现在嵌入式系统上，结果表明我们的方法在保证高效频谱使用的同时对干扰具有很强的抗干扰性。",
