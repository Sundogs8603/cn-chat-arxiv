    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种端到端的多相机三维多目标跟踪框架。该框架强调时空连续性，并整合了跟踪对象的前后推理。因此，我们将其命名为“基于过去和未来的跟踪”（PF-Track）。具体而言，我们的方法采用“注意力跟踪”框架，并通过对象查询连续地表示跟踪实例。为了明确使用历史线索，我们的“过去推理”模块学习精细化跟踪，并通过跨前一帧和其他对象的查询交叉注意来增强对象特征。而“未来推理”模块则消化历史信息并预测强健的未来轨迹。在长时间遮挡的情况下，我们的方法可以维持对象位置，通过整合运动预测实现重新关联。在nuScenes数据集上，我们的方法大幅提高了AMOTA，并将ID-Switches减少了90%，相比之前的方法有了显著的改善。",
