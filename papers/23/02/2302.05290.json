    "translated_abstract": "解决不适定反问题需要仔细制定有关感兴趣信号的先验信念，并对它们在有噪声测量中的表现进行准确的描述。基于稀疏性的手工制定信号先验越来越多地被数据驱动的深度生成模型所取代，并且几个团队最近展示了最新的基于分数的扩散模型具有强大的性能和灵活性。在本文中，我们展示了基于扩散模型的后验采样范式可以扩展到包括丰富、结构化的噪声模型。为此，我们提出了联合条件反向扩散过程，其中包含噪声和信号生成分布的学习分数。我们在各种存在结构性噪声的反问题中展示了强大的性能增益，优于使用归一化流和对抗网络的竞争基线。这在医学成像等领域开辟了扩散模型在实践中进行更准确建模的新机会和相关应用。",
