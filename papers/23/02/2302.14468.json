    "abstract": "We present SAINE, an Scientific Annotation and Inference ENgine based on a set of standard open-source software, such as Label Studio and MLflow. We show that our annotation engine can benefit the further development of a more accurate classification. Based on our previous work on hierarchical discipline classifications, we demonstrate its application using SAINE in understanding the space for scholarly publications. The user study of our annotation results shows that user input collected with the help of our system can help us better understand the classification process. We believe that our work will help to foster greater transparency and better understand scientific research. Our annotation and inference engine can further support the downstream meta-science projects. We welcome collaboration and feedback from the scientific community on these projects.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了SAINE，一种基于一组标准开源软件（如Label Studio和MLflow）的科学注释和推理引擎。我们展示了我们的注释引擎可以有助于更准确地进行分类的进一步发展。基于我们之前关于层次学科分类的工作，我们在了解学术出版物领域中使用SAINE进行应用。我们的注释结果的用户研究表明，在我们系统的帮助下收集到的用户输入能够帮助我们更好地理解分类过程。我们相信我们的工作将有助于促进更大的透明度和更好地理解科学研究。我们的注释和推理引擎还可以进一步支持下游元科学项目。我们欢迎科学界在这些项目上进行合作和反馈。演示视频可以在https://youtu.be/yToO-G9YQK4中访问。实时演示网站可在https://app.heartex上访问。",
