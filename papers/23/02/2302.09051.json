    "translated_abstract": "本文回顾了语言模型架构和策略的最新进展，重点关注混合技术在复杂问题回答中的应用。大型语言模型能够在标准问题上利用公共数据，但在解决更具体的复杂问题时（如在不同文化中个人自由概念的变化如何？什么是为减少气候变化而实现的最佳发电方法组合？），需要特定的架构、知识、技能、方法、敏感数据保护、可解释性、人类审批和多功能反馈。最近的项目如ChatGPT和GALACTICA允许非专业人员了解LLM在复杂QA中的巨大潜力以及同等强大的局限性。在本文中，我们首先审查所需的技能和评估技术。然后，我们综述了现有的混合架构，将LLM与基于规则的方法、信息检索、知识图谱和其他AI/ML技术相结合。最后，我们指出这些CQA系统的挑战，并提出未来研究的可能方向。",
