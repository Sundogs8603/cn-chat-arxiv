    "abstract": "Many learning algorithms used as normative models in neuroscience or as candidate approaches for learning on neuromorphic chips learn by contrasting one set of network states with another. These Contrastive Learning (CL) algorithms are traditionally implemented with rigid, temporally non-local, and periodic learning dynamics that could limit the range of physical systems capable of harnessing CL. In this study, we build on recent work exploring how CL might be implemented by biological or neurmorphic systems and show that this form of learning can be made temporally local, and can still function even if many of the dynamical requirements of standard training procedures are relaxed. Thanks to a set of general theorems corroborated by numerical experiments across several CL models, our results provide theoretical foundations for the study and development of CL methods for biological and neuromorphic neural networks.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多作为神经科学规范模型或用于神经形态芯片学习的候选方法的学习算法通过将一组网络状态与另一组进行对比来进行学习。这些对比学习（CL）算法通常采用刚性、时间上不连续和周期性的学习动力学实现，这可能限制可以利用CL的物理系统范围。本研究建立在最近的工作基础上，探索了CL如何在生物或神经形态系统中实现，并展示了这种学习形式可以在时间上具有局部性，并且即使放松了标准训练过程的许多动力学要求，仍然可以正常运行。通过一组在几个CL模型上进行的数值实验支持的一般定理，我们的结果为生物和神经形态神经网络的CL方法的研究和发展提供了理论基础。",
