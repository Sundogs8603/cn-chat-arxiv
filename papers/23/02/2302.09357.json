    "translated_abstract": "内生性是实际数据中常见的现象，因为遗漏变量、战略行为、测量误差等原因导致噪声和协变量之间的依赖性。与之相反，现有的无界噪声和线性Bandit随机在线线性回归分析严重依赖外生性，即噪声和协变量之间的独立性。鉴于这一差距，我们研究了工具变量（IV）回归在随机在线学习中的超识别和恰好识别情况。我们提出使用Two-Stage Least Squares方法的在线变体（即O2SLS）来处理内生性。我们的分析表明，O2SLS实现了$ \\mathcal{O} \\left(d_x d_z \\log ^ 2 T \\right)$的识别率和$ \\tilde {\\mathcal {O}} \\left(\\gamma \\sqrt {d_x T} \\right)$的预测遗憾率。",
