    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在实际的无线多输入多输出（MIMO）通信系统中，采用数字调制和空中计算（AirComp）的情况下，联邦学习（FL）的性能优化。特别考虑了一个MIMO系统，在该系统中，边缘设备使用波束形成将其本地收集的数据训练的本地FL模型传输给参数服务器（PS），以最大化可调度传输的设备数量。PS作为中央控制器，使用接收到的本地FL模型生成一个全局FL模型并广播给所有设备。由于无线网络中的带宽有限，采用了AirComp以实现高效的无线数据聚合。然而，无线信道的衰落会产生基于AirComp的FL方案中的总体失真。为了克服这一挑战，我们提出了一种改进的联邦平均（FedAvg）算法，将数字调制与AirComp相结合以减轻失真问题。",
