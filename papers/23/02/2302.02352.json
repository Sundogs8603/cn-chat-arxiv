    "translated_abstract": "终身用户行为建模，即从丰富的历史行为中提取用户的隐藏兴趣，在现代CTR预测系统中起着核心作用。传统算法主要遵循两个级联阶段：一个简单的通用搜索单元（GSU）用于快速搜索数以万计的长期行为，一个精确搜索单元（ESU）用于对来自GSU的少数候选人进行有针对性的关注。虽然高效，但现有算法大多存在一个关键限制：GSU和ESU之间的目标-行为相关指标不一致。因此，他们的GSU通常会错过高相关的行为，但又会检索到被ESU认为不相关的行为。在这种情况下，无论ESU如何分配注意力，它的关注点大多与真实用户兴趣偏离，从而降低了整体CTR预测准确性。为了解决这种不一致性，我们提出了“两阶段兴趣网络（TWIN）”，",
