    "abstract": "Community detection is a crucial task to unravel the intricate dynamics of online social networks. The emergence of these networks has dramatically increased the volume and speed of interactions among users, presenting researchers with unprecedented opportunities to explore and analyze the underlying structure of social communities. Despite a growing interest in tracking the evolution of groups of users in real-world social networks, the predominant focus of community detection efforts has been on communities within static networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for tracking communities over time in a dynamic network, where a series of significant events is identified for each community. Our framework adopts a modularity-based strategy and does not require a predefined threshold, leading to a more accurate and robust tracking of dynamic communities. We validated the efficacy of our framework through extensive experiments on synthetic networks featuring embedded events. ",

    "translated_abstract": "社区检测是解析在线社交网络复杂动态的关键任务。这些网络的出现极大地增加了用户之间交互的数量和速度，为研究人员提供了探索和分析社交群体的基本结构的前所未有的机会。尽管对于实际社交网络中用户组的演变越来越感兴趣，但目前的社区检测工作主要集中在静态网络内的社区。在本文中，我们引入了一种在动态网络中跟踪社区随时间变化的新框架，为每个社区识别了一系列重要事件。我们的框架采用了基于模块化的策略，不需要预定义的阈值，从而更准确、更鲁棒地跟踪动态社区。通过在嵌入事件的合成网络上进行大量实验证实了我们框架的有效性。",
