    "translated_abstract": "高斯过程状态空间模型（GPSSMs）为建模潜在状态的动态提供了一种有原则和灵活的方法，通过似然模型以离散时间点观测。然而，由于模型中潜在变量的数量较大且它们之间存在强时序依赖性，因此在 GPSSMs 中进行推断是计算上和统计上具有挑战性的。在本文中，我们提出了一种在贝叶斯 GPSSMs 中进行推断的新方法，克服了以前方法的缺点，即过于简化的假设和高计算要求。我们的方法基于在诱导变量形式主义内通过随机梯度哈密顿蒙特卡罗进行自由形式的变分推断。此外，通过利用我们提出的变分分布，我们提供了一种折叠扩展方法，其中诱导变量在解析上进行边际化。我们还展示了将我们的框架与粒子 MCMC 方法相结合的结果。我们展示了在s上的结果表明，我们的方法在计算效率和推断准确性上都具有优势。",
