    "abstract": "Recent advances in generative models such as GPT may be used to fabricate indistinguishable fake customer reviews at a much lower cost, thus posing challenges for social media platforms to detect these machine-generated fake reviews. We propose to leverage the high-quality elite restaurant reviews verified by Yelp to generate fake reviews from the OpenAI GPT review creator and ultimately fine-tune a GPT output detector to predict fake reviews that significantly outperform existing solutions. We further apply the model to predict non-elite reviews and identify the patterns across several dimensions, such as review, user and restaurant characteristics, and writing style. We show that social media platforms are continuously challenged by machine-generated fake reviews, although they may implement detection systems to filter out suspicious reviews.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近生成模型（如GPT）的发展使得以更低的成本制造出难以区分的虚假顾客评论，从而对社交媒体平台检测这些机器生成的虚假评论造成挑战。本文提出利用Yelp验证的高质量的精英餐厅评论来生成OpenAI GPT评论生成器的虚假评论，并最终微调GPT输出检测器来预测明显优于现有解决方案的虚假评论。我们进一步将模型应用于预测非精英评论，并在几个维度（如评论、用户和餐厅特征以及写作风格）上识别模式。我们展示了社交媒体平台正在不断面临机器生成的虚假评论的挑战，尽管他们可能实施检测系统以过滤出可疑的评论。",
