The most prevalent type of CAPTCHA is text-based, designed to be easily recognized by humans while being unsolvable towards machines or robots. However, as deep learning technology progresses, development of convolutional neural network (CNN) models that predict text-based CAPTCHAs becomes easier. The purpose of this research is to investigate the flaws and vulnerabilities in the CAPTCHA generating systems in order to design more resilient CAPTCHAs. To achieve this, we created CapNet, a Convolutional Neural Network. The proposed platform can evaluate both numerical and alphanumerical CAPTCHAs",

    "translated_abstract": "几个网站为防范危险的互联网攻击并提高安全性，实施了CAPTCHAs（Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart），这是一种用于识别最终用户是人类还是机器人的验证系统。最常见的CAPTCHA是基于文本的，设计成易于人类识别而对机器或机器人难以解决。然而，随着深度学习技术的进步，开发能够预测基于文本的CAPTCHAs的卷积神经网络（CNN）模型变得更加容易。这项研究的目的在于调查CAPTCHA生成系统中的缺陷和漏洞，以设计更具弹性的CAPTCHAs。为实现这一目标，我们创建了CapNet，一个卷积神经网络。所提出的平台可以评估数字和字母数字混合型CAPTCHAs。",
