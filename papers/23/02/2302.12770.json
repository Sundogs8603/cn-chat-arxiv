    "abstract": "Utilities and transmission system operators (TSO) around the world implement demand response programs for reducing electricity consumption by sending information on the state of balance between supply demand to end-use consumers. We construct a Bayesian persuasion model to analyse such demand response programs. Using a simple model consisting of two time steps for contract signing and invoking, and two states of the state of generation, we analyse the relation between the pricing of electricity and the incentives of the TSO to garble information about the true state of the generation. We show that if the electricity is priced at its marginal cost of production, the TSO has no incentive to lie and always tells the truth. On the other hand, we provide conditions where overpricing of electricity leads the TSO to provide no information to the consumer.",

    "translated_abstract": "全球的公用事业和输电系统运营商实施需求响应计划，通过向最终用户发送供需状态信息来降低电力消耗。我们构建了一个贝叶斯说服模型来分析这种需求响应计划。使用一个简单的模型，包括两个时间步骤用于合同签署和唤醒以及两个状态的发电状态，分析电力定价与TSO歪曲信息的真实状态之间的关系。我们表明，如果电力价格定为其生产边际成本，则TSO没有欺骗的动机且总是说真话。另一方面，我们提供了过高定价导致TSO向用户提供无信息的条件。",
