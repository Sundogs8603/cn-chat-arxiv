    "translated_abstract": "高通量测序技术的发展使得研究人员能够更好地研究癌症分子特征和基于分子亚型的癌症分类。整合多组学数据已被证明对构建更精准的分类模型非常有效。目前的多组学整合模型主要使用早期融合（串联）或者基于深度神经网络的晚期融合。由于生物系统的特性，图是生物医学数据的更好表示形式。尽管已经提出了一些基于图神经网络（GNN）的多组学整合方法，但它们存在三个常见的不足之处。一是大多数方法只使用一种类型的连接，要么是组间连接，要么是组内连接；二是它们只考虑一种类型的GNN层，要么是图卷积网络（GCN），要么是图注意力网络（GAT）；三是大多数方法缺乏更复杂的癌症分类测试。",
