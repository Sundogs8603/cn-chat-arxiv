Recently it is becoming popular for individuals to use social media platforms (e.g., Reddit) to express their difficulties and health issues (e.g., depression) and seek support from other users in online communities.

    "translated_abstract": "抑郁症是一种广泛存在的心理健康问题，影响了全球估计3.8%的人口。它也是全球残疾的主要因素之一。最近，个人越来越喜欢使用社交媒体平台（如Reddit）来表达他们的困难和健康问题（如抑郁症），并在在线社区寻求其他用户的支持。这为通过分析数百万帖子以寻找潜在的干预机会，自动识别具有抑郁症的社交媒体用户提供了巨大的机会。深度学习方法因其易用性、高效处理能力和在许多自然语言处理（NLP）任务上的最新结果而在机器学习和自然语言处理领域开始占据主导地位。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种混合深度学习模型，将预训练的句子BERT（SBERT）和卷积神经网络（CNN）结合起来，以通过他们在Reddit上的帖子检测抑郁症患者。句子BERT用于学习句子的意思。",
