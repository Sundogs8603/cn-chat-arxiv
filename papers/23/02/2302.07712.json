    "translated_abstract": "本文重访了经典的非贪婪算法（NGA）和最近提出的具有外推的近端交替最小化（PAMe）方法在 $L_1$-范数PCA中的应用，并研究了它们的有限步收敛性。文章首先证明了NGA可以作为条件次梯度或者交替最大化方法进行解释。通过将其视为条件次梯度，我们证明了在一定条件下，算法生成的迭代点将在有限步骤中保持不变；当投射维数为一时，可以消除这种条件的限制。而将算法视为交替最优化方法，然后证明目标值在满足一定优化条件的情况下最多在 $\\left\\lceil\\frac{F^{\\max}}{\\tau_0} \\right\\rceil$ 步后固定不变。接着，文章分析了NGA的改进形式及其收敛性。",
