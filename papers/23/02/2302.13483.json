    "translated_abstract": "解释性不足是限制高效深度强化学习(DRL)控制器实际采用的关键因素。网络解释性强化学习迄今使用引人注目的输入特征来解释控制器的行为。然而，这些基于特征的解决方案不能完全解释控制器的决策过程。通常，运营商有兴趣了解控制器对未来性能的影响，而基于特征的解决方案无法捕捉。在本文中，我们提出了CrystalBox，这是一个框架，通过关键网络性能指标的未来影响来解释控制器的行为。CrystalBox采用一种新颖的基于学习的方法，生成简洁而富有表现力的解释。我们使用DRL网络控制器的奖励组件作为解释的基础，这是运营商有意义的关键绩效指标。CrystalBox是通用的，可以适用于离散和连续控制环境。",
