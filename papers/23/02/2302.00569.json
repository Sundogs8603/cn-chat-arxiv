    "translated_abstract": "可视化推荐系统（VRSs）是一个新颖而具有挑战性的研究领域，旨在帮助从数据中生成洞察力图表，并支持非专业用户进行信息发现。在提出的许多贡献中，一些系统采用了模仿人类分析师的雄心勃勃目标，即识别数据中的相关关系，并做出适当的设计选择以用具有洞察力的图表来表示这些关系。我们将这些系统称为“无偏见”VRSs，因为它们不依赖于人类提供的约束和规则，而是试图自主学习任务。尽管无偏见的VRSs具有很高的应用潜力，但它们的进展受到多个障碍的阻碍，包括缺乏用于训练推荐算法的标准化数据集、学习设计规则的困难以及定义用于评估生成图表的感知有效性的定量标准。",
