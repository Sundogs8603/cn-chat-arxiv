    "translated_abstract": "基于扩散的生成模型在图像合成方面表现出了巨大的潜力，但是它们可能带来安全和隐私风险的研究却很少。本文研究了扩散模型对成员隐私攻击的易受性，这是一种常见的隐私问题。我们的研究结果表明，现有的面向GANs或VAE的成员隐私攻击对于扩散模型来说基本无效，要么是因为适用场景不同（例如需要GANs的判别器），要么是因为假设不当（例如，合成样本和成员样本之间的距离更近）。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了一个基于查询的成员隐私攻击方法Step-wise Error Comparing Membership Inference（SecMI），它通过评估在每个时间步长中前向过程后验估计的匹配情况来推断成员身份。SecMI遵循MIA中的常见过拟合假设，即成员样本通常具有较小的估计误差，而比较保持样本。我们同时考虑了标准的扩散模型和切比雪夫扩展模型，并在多个数据集上进行了评估。",
