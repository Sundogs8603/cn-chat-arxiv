    "abstract": "Traditional anomaly detection methods aim to identify objects that deviate from most other objects by treating all features equally. In contrast, contextual anomaly detection methods aim to detect objects that deviate from other objects within a context of similar objects by dividing the features into contextual features and behavioral features. In this paper, we develop connections between dependency-based traditional anomaly detection methods and contextual anomaly detection methods. Based on resulting insights, we propose a novel approach to inherently interpretable contextual anomaly detection that uses Quantile Regression Forests to model dependencies between features. Extensive experiments on various synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in identifying contextual anomalies in terms of accuracy and interpretability.",

    "translated_abstract": "传统的异常检测方法通过平等对待所有特征来识别偏离大多数其他对象的对象。相比之下，上下文异常检测方法通过将特征划分为上下文特征和行为特征，旨在检测偏离类似对象上下文的其他对象。在本文中，我们建立了依赖于传统的基于依赖的异常检测方法和上下文异常检测方法之间的联系。基于由此获得的见解，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，采用分位数回归森林来模拟特征之间的依赖关系，实现内在的可解释上下文异常检测。各种合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，我们的方法在识别上下文异常方面的准确性和可解释性方面优于现有的状态-of-art异常检测方法。",
