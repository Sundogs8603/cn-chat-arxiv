    "translated_abstract": "智能系统需要在其生命周期内不断获取、更新、积累和利用知识以应对现实世界的动态变化。这种能力称为持续学习，为AI系统自适应发展提供了基础。然而，持续学习的一个显著限制是灾难性遗忘，即学习一个新任务通常会导致旧任务的性能显著降低。近年来，不断涌现的各种进展大大扩展了持续学习的理解和应用。本文提供了一个全面的持续学习综述，旨在连接基本设置、理论基础、代表性方法和实际应用。我们总结了现有理论和实证结果，概括了持续学习的一般目标：减少灾难性遗忘，实现高效的和终身的学习，以及实现更深层次的表征学习。我们还回顾了各种持续学习方法，包括基于正则化、基于回放和基于生成的方法，并讨论了它们的优缺点。最后，我们强调了一些有前途的应用领域，如机器人、自然语言处理和计算机视觉，并确定了一些开放挑战和未来研究方向。",
