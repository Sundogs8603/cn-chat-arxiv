    "translated_abstract": "上行的超可靠低延迟流量（URLLC）的动态调度可以通过仅在必要时分配资源来显著提高增强型移动宽带（eMBB）设备等共存服务的效率。主要的挑战在于URRLC数据包产生过程中的不确定性，这就要求在未来帧中使用URRLC流量预测器。实际上，这种预测可能会高估或低估要产生的URRLC数据量，导致预先分配过多或过少的资源用于URRLC数据包。本文介绍了一种新的URRLC数据包调度程序，无论URRLC流量预测器的质量如何，都可以提供关于可靠性和延迟的正式保证。该方法利用了在线符合预测（CP）的最新进展，并遵循根据动态调整分配的资源量的原则以满足",
