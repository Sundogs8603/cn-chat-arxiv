    "abstract": "In manufacturing settings, data collection and analysis are often a time-consuming, challenging, and costly process. It also hinders the use of advanced machine learning and data-driven methods which require a substantial amount of offline training data to generate good results. It is particularly challenging for small manufacturers who do not share the resources of a large enterprise. Recently, with the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT), data can be collected in an integrated manner across the factory in real-time, sent to the cloud for advanced analysis, and used to update the machine learning model sequentially. Nevertheless, small manufacturers face two obstacles in reaping the benefits of IoT: they may be unable to afford or generate enough data to operate a private cloud, and they may be hesitant to share their raw data with a public cloud. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging concept of collaborative learning that can help small-scale industries address these issues",

    "translated_abstract": "在制造领域，数据的收集和分析通常是耗时、具有挑战性且成本高昂的过程，这也阻碍了使用先进的机器学习和数据驱动方法来生成良好的结果，因为这些方法需要大量的离线训练数据。对于那些没有大型企业资源的小型制造商尤其具有挑战性。最近，随着物联网(IoT)的引入，数据可以在整个工厂中以集成的方式实时收集，发送到云端进行高级分析，并用于按顺序更新机器学习模型。然而，小型制造商在利用IoT的好处时面临两个障碍：他们可能无法负担或生成足够的数据来操作私有云，并且他们可能不愿意将原始数据共享到公共云。联邦学习(FL)是协作学习的新兴概念，可以帮助小规模工业解决这些问题。",
    "tldr": "该论文讨论了联邦学习在制造业中的应用，说明其对解决制造业中数据收集和分析等问题的意义，而其中的联邦学习则可以通过协作集成小型厂商的数据，并在不同设备间完成模型的更新，从而使小型制造商能够更好地利用先进的机器学习和数据驱动方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper discusses the application of federated learning in the manufacturing industry, explains its significance in solving issues such as data collection and analysis, and proposes that federated learning can allow small manufacturers to better utilize advanced machine learning and data-driven methods by collaboratively integrating their data and updating the model across different devices."
