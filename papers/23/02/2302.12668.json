    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于其高效逃离局部最优和生成广泛高效解的能力，质量多样性(QD)算法已成为优化方法。最近，多目标MAP-Elites (MOME)通过在Map Elites网格的每个单元格中维护帕累托前沿将QD范例扩展到多目标设置。MOME在同时获得多样的解的同时实现了与NSGA-II和SPEA2相竞争的全局性能。但是，MOME受非定向遗传搜索机制的限制，这些机制在高维搜索空间中面临困难。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的QD算法——带有策略梯度辅助和基于拥挤的探索的多目标MAP-Elites (MOME-PGX)来扩展MOME以提高其数据效率和性能。MOME-PGX使用基于梯度的优化有效地将解决方案驱向更高的性能。",
