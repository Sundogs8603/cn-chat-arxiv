    "translated_abstract": "基于链接遍历的查询处理（LTQP）在一组文档上评估 sparql 查询而不是单个数据集，通常被视为在理论上有趣但不实用的技术。然而，在数据的超集中心化越来越受到审查的时代，具有简单基于文档的界面的分散式数据网络具有吸引力，因为它使数据发布者能够控制其数据和访问权。虽然 LTQP 允许在这样的网络上评估复杂的查询，但由于包含数据的文档数量过多，它受到性能问题的困扰，同时也存在信息质量方面的担忧（由于提供此类文档的许多来源）。在现有的 LTQP 方法中，寻找要查询的来源的负担完全由数据使用者承担。本文认为，为了解决这些问题，数据发布者应该也能够建议感兴趣的来源，引导数据使用者使用相关且可靠的数据。",
