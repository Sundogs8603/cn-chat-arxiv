    "translated_abstract": "词形还原是一项自然语言处理的任务，它包括从给定的屈折词生成其规范形式或词形还原。词形还原是简化下游自然语言处理应用的基本任务之一，对于高度屈折语言尤为重要。虽然根据屈折词获得词形还原形式的过程可以通过考虑其形态句法类别来解释，但在训练上下文词形还原器时引入细粒度的形态句法信息已经成为常见做法，而无视下游绩效是否优化。为了解决这个问题，本文实证研究了在六种语言中考察形态信息在上下文词形还原器开发中的作用，这六种语言的形态复杂性各不相同，包括巴斯克语、土耳其语、俄语、捷克语、西班牙语和英语。此外，与绝大多数先前的工作不同，我们还在领域外环境中进行了词形还原器的评估。",
