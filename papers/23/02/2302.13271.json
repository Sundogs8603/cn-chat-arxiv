    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了弱形式估计非线性动力学（WENDy）方法，用于估计非线性ODE系统的模型参数。WENDy不依赖于任何数值微分方程求解器，可以计算准确的估计值，并且对于大量（生物学上重要的）测量噪声是鲁棒的。对于低维系统和适度数量的数据，WENDy在速度和精度上与传统的基于前向求解器的非线性最小二乘方法相竞争。对于高维系统和强系统，WENDy通常比基于前向求解器的方法更快（通常快几个数量级）和更精确。其核心数学思想涉及将模型的强形式表示有效地转换为其弱形式，然后解决回归问题以进行参数推断。其核心统计思想基于误差对变量框架，这需要使用迭代加权最小二乘法。",
