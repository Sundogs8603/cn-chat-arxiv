    "translated_abstract": "本文显示神经元和突触动力学的异质性降低了递归脉冲神经网络(RSNN)的脉冲活动，同时提高了预测性能，实现了高效的脉冲减少(自主)学习。我们分析表明，神经元整合/放松动力学的多样性提高了RSNN学习更多不同的输入模式(更高的记忆容量)，从而提高了分类和预测性能。我们进一步证明了突触的异质性时序相关可塑性(STDP)动力学降低了脉冲活动但保持了记忆容量。分析结果促使我们使用贝叶斯优化确定神经元和突触的异质RSNN设计，以提高$\\mathcal{E}$，即脉冲活动和记忆容量的比值。时间序列分类和预测任务的实证结果表明，优化的HRSNN提高了性能并减少了脉冲活动",
