    "abstract": "The scarcity of labeled data is one of the main challenges of applying deep learning models on time series data in the real world. Therefore, several approaches, e.g., transfer learning, self-supervised learning, and semi-supervised learning, have been recently developed to promote the learning capability of deep learning models from the limited time series labels. In this survey, for the first time, we provide a novel taxonomy to categorize existing approaches that address the scarcity of labeled data problem in time series data based on their dependency on external data sources. Moreover, we present a review of the recent advances in each approach and conclude the limitations of the current works and provide future directions that could yield better progress in the field.",

    "translated_abstract": "标记数据的稀缺性是在现实世界中应用深度学习模型于时间序列数据时的主要挑战之一。因此，最近已经开发了几种方法，例如迁移学习，自监督学习和半监督学习，以促进深度学习模型从有限的时间序列标签中获取学习能力。在本综述中，我们首次提供了一个新颖的分类系统，用来根据它们对外部数据源的依赖，对解决时间序列数据中标记数据稀缺性问题的现有方法进行分类。此外，我们对每种方法的最新进展进行了审查，并总结了当前工作的局限性，并提供了可能在这一领域取得更好进展的未来方向。",
