For example, on AMiner, an online academic search platform, about 10% of names own more than 100 authors. Such real-world challenging cases have not been effectively addressed by existing researches due to the small-scale or low-quality datasets that they have used.

To this end, we present WhoIsWho owning, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000,000 papers built using an interactive annotation process, a regular leaderboard with comprehensive tasks, and an easy-to-use toolkit encapsulating the entire pipeline as well as the most powerful features and baseline models for tackling the tasks.
