    "translated_abstract": "跨领域的类比推理是一种对人类来说具有挑战性的核心创造能力。最近的研究已经证明了大语言模型（LLMs）生成跨领域类比的能力。然而，这种能力的可靠性和潜在用途的探索却鲜有系统的研究。本文系统地探讨了LLMs增强跨领域类比推理的能力。在三项研究中，我们发现：1）LLM生成的跨领域类比在问题重构任务的背景下经常被评为有帮助（中位数5个评分中有4个是有帮助的），并且通常（约80％的情况）导致问题重新制定方面的可观察变化；2）存在最多25％的输出被评为有潜在危害的上限，其中大部分是由于潜在的不安内容，而不是有偏见或有毒内容。这些结果证明了LLMs的潜在效用和风险，以增强跨领域类比推理的能力。",
