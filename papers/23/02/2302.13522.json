    "translated_abstract": "图形神经网络 (GNNs) 已经展示了对于各种具有挑战性的真实应用的巨大潜力，但 GNN 研究中的一个主要障碍是缺乏大规模灵活的数据集。现有的大部分公共GNN数据集都相对较小，这限制了 GNN 的推广到未知数据的能力。很少有大型的图形数据集提供丰富的标记数据，这使得难以确定 GNN 模型在未知数据上的低准确性是由于训练数据不足还是模型无法推广。此外，训练 GNN 的数据集需要提供灵活性，以便深入研究各种因素对 GNN 模型训练的影响。在这项工作中，我们介绍了伊利诺伊图形基准 (IGB)，这是一个研究数据集工具，开发人员可以使用它来高精度地训练、审查和系统地评估GNN模型。IGB 包括同质和异质性学术图形，规模巨大，并且可以标记和操作，以模拟真实场景。该数据集还包括用于生成具有不同特性的合成图形的工具，使研究人员能够探索各种图形特性对 GNN 的影响。我们相信，伊利诺伊图形基准将为 GNN 研究团体提供有价值的资源，以解决公共图形数据集在标记、特征、异质性和大小方面的差距，以用于深度学习研究。",
