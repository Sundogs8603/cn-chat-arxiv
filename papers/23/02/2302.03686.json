    "translated_abstract": "温度缩放是一种调节模型分布锐度的常用技术。它广泛应用于采样可能的生成物和校准模型不确定性，甚至在许多大型语言模型的部署中作为可控参数。然而，自回归模型依赖于贪婪地优化下一个标记的短视温度缩放。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，即长时间尺度温度缩放（LHTS），用于从温度缩放的联合分布中采样。LHTS与所有基于似然的模型兼容，并优化样本的长时间尺度似然。我们推导了一个温度相关的LHTS目标，并展示了在一系列温度上微调模型可以产生一个具有可控长时间尺度温度参数的单一模型。我们在图像扩散模型和字符/语言自回归模型上进行了LHTS实验，证明了相比于短视温度缩放的优势。",
