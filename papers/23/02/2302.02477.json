    "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown great promise toward treating motor symptoms caused by Parkinson's disease (PD), by delivering electrical pulses to the Basal Ganglia (BG) region of the brain. However, DBS devices approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can only deliver continuous DBS (cDBS) stimuli at a fixed amplitude; this energy inefficient operation reduces battery lifetime of the device, cannot adapt treatment dynamically for activity, and may cause significant side-effects (e.g., gait impairment). In this work, we introduce an offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework, allowing the use of past clinical data to train an RL policy to adjust the stimulation amplitude in real time, with the goal of reducing energy use while maintaining the same level of treatment (i.e., control) efficacy as cDBS. Moreover, clinical protocols require the safety and performance of such RL controllers to be demonstrated ahead of deployments in patients. Thus, we also introduce",

    "translated_abstract": "深度脑电刺激（DBS）通过向脑的基底神经节区域传递电脉冲，显示出治疗帕金森氏症（PD）引起的运动症状的巨大潜力。然而，得到美国食品和药物管理局（FDA）批准的DBS仅能以固定幅度提供持续DBS（cDBS）刺激；这种能量低效的操作降低了设备的电池寿命，不能根据活动情况动态调整治疗，可能会引起显著的副作用（如步态障碍）。在本文中，我们介绍了一种离线强化学习（RL）框架，允许利用过去的临床数据来训练一个RL策略，从而在实时调整刺激幅度的同时，以减少能量使用，同时保持与cDBS相同水平的治疗效力（即控制）。此外，临床协议要求在将这种RL控制器部署到患者之前，需证明其安全性和性能。因此，我们还引入了基于模拟技术的安全检测流程。",
