    "translated_abstract": "短期负荷预测（STLF）对电网和能源市场的有效和经济运行至关重要。然而，电力需求的非线性和非平稳性以及其对各种外部因素的依赖性使得STLF成为一项具有挑战性的任务。为了评估这些模型在提前一天的预测环境下的准确性，在本文中我们专注于葡萄牙的国家净聚合STLF，并进行了一项比较研究，考虑了一组有指示性的、被广泛接受的深度自回归模型，包括多层感知机（MLP）、长短期记忆网络（LSTM）、神经基础扩展系数分析（N-BEATS）、时间卷积网络（TCN）和时间融合变压器（TFT）。此外，我们还确定了显著影响需求的因素，并研究了它们对每个模型准确性的影响。",
