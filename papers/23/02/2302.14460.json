    "translated_abstract": "阑尾炎是儿科腹部手术的最常见原因之一。随着机器学习的最新进展，数据驱动的决策支持可以帮助临床医生诊断和管理患者，同时减少非关键手术的数量。以往的阑尾炎决策支持系统主要关注临床、实验室、评分和计算机断层扫描数据，主要忽视了腹部超声成像，这是一种非侵入性和方便获得的诊断方法。为此，我们开发和验证了利用超声影像预测疑似阑尾炎诊断、管理和严重程度的可解释机器学习模型。我们的模型使用了由579名儿科患者的1709幅超声影像，以及临床和实验室数据构成的数据集进行训练。我们的方法学贡献在于将概念瓶颈模型推广到具有多个视图和不完整概念集的预测问题。值得注意的是，这样的模型适用于干预操作。",
