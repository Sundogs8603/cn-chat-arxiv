    "abstract": "We consider online scheduling on unrelated (heterogeneous) machines in a speed-oblivious setting, where an algorithm is unaware of the exact job-dependent processing speeds. We show strong impossibility results for clairvoyant and non-clairvoyant algorithms and overcome them in models inspired by practical settings: (i) we provide competitive learning-augmented algorithms, assuming that (possibly erroneous) predictions on the speeds are given, and (ii) we provide competitive algorithms for the speed-ordered model, where a single global order of machines according to their unknown job-dependent speeds is known. We prove strong theoretical guarantees and evaluate our findings on a representative heterogeneous multi-core processor. These seem to be the first empirical results for scheduling algorithms with predictions that are evaluated in a non-synthetic hardware environment.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在异构机器上进行在线调度，并采用速度遗忘的算法，其中算法不知道准确的作业处理速度。我们对预言算法和非预言算法进行了强大的不可能结果，并在受实际环境启发的模型中克服了这些问题：(i)我们提供了具有竞争学习性的算法，假设给出了（可能是错误的）速度预测；(ii)我们提供了适用于速度排序模型的有竞争力的算法，其中根据其未知的作业处理速度，已知一种单一全局排序算法。我们证明了强有力的理论保证，并对代表性的异构多核处理器进行了评估。这似乎是第一次在非合成硬件环境中评估具有预测的调度算法的实证结果。",
