    "translated_abstract": "随机效用模型是经济学中离散选择分析中最基本的模型之一。虽然Falmagne（1978）获得了随机效用模型的公理化，但他的表征需要对选择的强可观察性，即必须从所有替代品集合的子集中观察到选择的频率。然而，在数据集不完整的情况下，即某些选择集的频率不可观察，对于公理化我们知道的很少。实际上，在现实中的数据集几乎总是违反Falmagne（1978）所假定的可观察性要求。我们考虑了一个不完整的数据集，在这个数据集中，我们不观察一些替代品的频率：对于所有其他替代品，我们观察到其频率。对于这样的数据集，我们获得了一个有限的线性不等式系统，该系统是随机效用模型来理性解释此类数据集的必要条件和充分条件。我们的公理化不需要观察所有子集，因此适用于Falmagne（1978）表征不适用的情况。",
