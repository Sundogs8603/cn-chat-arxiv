    "abstract": "The widespread availability of internet access and handheld devices confers to social media a power similar to the one newspapers used to have. People seek affordable information on social media and can reach it within seconds. Yet this convenience comes with dangers; any user may freely post whatever they please and the content can stay online for a long period, regardless of its truthfulness. A need to detect untruthful information, also known as fake news, arises. In this paper, we present an end-to-end solution that accurately detects fake news and immunizes network nodes that spread them in real-time. To detect fake news, we propose two new stack deep learning architectures that utilize convolutional and bidirectional LSTM layers. To mitigate the spread of fake news, we propose a real-time network-aware strategy that (1) constructs a minimum-cost weighted directed spanning tree for a detected node, and (2) immunizes nodes in that tree by scoring their harmfulness using a novel ran",

    "translated_abstract": "互联网的广泛普及和手持设备的可用性使得社交媒体具有类似报纸的影响力。人们可以在社交媒体上即时获取廉价的信息。然而，这种便利性也带来了危险，任何用户都可以自由发布任何内容，而不论其真实性。因此，需要检测虚假信息，也称为假新闻。本文提出了一个端到端的解决方案，可以准确地检测假新闻，并在实时中免于传播它们的网络节点上进行免疫。为了检测假新闻，我们提出了两种新的堆栈深度学习架构，利用卷积和双向LSTM层。为了缓解假新闻的传播，我们提出了一种实时网络感知策略，它（1）为检测到的节点构建了一个最小成本加权的有向生成树，并且（2）通过使用一种新的分数化危险性方法来免疫该树中的节点。",
