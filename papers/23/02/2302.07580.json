    "translated_abstract": "由于算法决策对现实世界应用的增长影响，模型的可解释性已成为机器学习中的关键问题。树集成方法（如随机森林或XgBoost）是用于分类任务的强大学习工具。然而，虽然将多个树组合起来可能会提供比单个树更高的预测质量，但它牺牲了可解释性的特性，导致了“黑盒”模型。基于此，我们的目标是开发一种可解释的树集成模型表示，可以为其行为提供有价值的见解。首先，针对目标树集成模型，我们开发了一种基于热图表示的层次化可视化工具，考虑到特征的频率和选择特征的层级作为重要性的指标。接下来，我们提出了一个混合整数线性规划（MILP）的形式，用于构造一个准确模拟目标模型的单个最优多变量树。",
