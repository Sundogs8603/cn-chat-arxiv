    "abstract": "Narratives include a rich source of events unfolding over time and context. Automatic understanding of these events provides a summarised comprehension of the narrative for further computation (such as reasoning). In this paper, we study the Information Status (IS) of the events and propose a novel challenging task: the automatic identification of \\textit{new} events in a narrative. We define an event as a triplet of subject, predicate, and object. The event is categorized as new with respect to the discourse context and whether it can be inferred through commonsense reasoning. We annotated a publicly available corpus of narratives with the new events at sentence level using human annotators. We present the annotation protocol and study the quality of the annotation and the difficulty of the task. We publish the annotated dataset, annotation materials, and machine learning baseline models for the task of new event extraction for narrative understanding.",

    "translated_abstract": "叙事包含了上下文和时间的丰富事件资源。对这些事件的自动理解提供了摘要理解，以供进一步的计算(如推理)。本文研究了事件的信息状态(IS)，并提出了一个新的有挑战性的任务:自动识别叙述中的新事件。我们将事件定义为主语、谓语和宾语的三元组。该事件相对于话语上下文被归类为新事件，并取决于是否可以通过常识推理来推导。我们使用人类标注者在公开的叙述语料库上进行了句子级别的新事件标注。我们提供了标注协议，并研究了注释的质量和任务的难度。我们公开了标注的数据集、标注材料和用于叙述理解中新事件提取的机器学习基准模型。",
