    "translated_abstract": "随着太空垃圾日益增多，对于观察废弃卫星以规划维修或进行去轨作业的需要越来越迫切。然而，太空巡检任务本身就是一项挑战性工作，通常需要多个观测卫星的精心协调。在高度非线性的环境中，目标可能是未知的或者不可预测的，没有时间进行连续的地面指挥和控制，这使得任务复杂化之余，也迫切需要自主、强韧、去中心化的巡检方案。为了实现这一目标，我们考虑采用一种层次化的、学习型的方法来进行多智能体翻滚目标的巡检规划。我们的解决方案包括两个组成部分：一个使用深度强化学习来训练的视点或高级规划器，以及一个处理预先指定视点之间点对点导航的导航规划器。本文提出了一种适用的新问题形成和方法。",
