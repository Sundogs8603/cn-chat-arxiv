    "translated_abstract": "自训练的半监督学习严重依赖于伪标签选择（PLS）。选择通常取决于初始模型拟合标记数据的程度。过早的过拟合可能通过选择具有过度自信但错误的预测的实例（通常称为确认偏差）而传播到最终模型。本文介绍了BPLS，这是一种用于PLS的贝叶斯框架，旨在减轻这个问题。其核心是选择标签实例的标准：伪样本的后验预测的分析近似。我们通过证明伪样本的后验预测的贝叶斯最优性获得了这种选择标准。我们进一步通过解析逼近克服计算难题。它与边际似然的关系使我们能够提出基于拉普拉斯方法和高斯积分的逼近。我们针对参数广义线性和非参数广义加性模型对BPLS进行了实证评估。",
