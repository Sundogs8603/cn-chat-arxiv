    "translated_abstract": "电子显微镜和扫描探针显微镜产生大量的图像或高光谱数据，例如EELS或4D STEM，这些数据包含材料的各种结构、物理和化学性质信息。为了从这些数据中提取有价值的见解，重要的是要识别出数据中物理上分离的区域，如相、铁电变体和它们之间的边界。为了推导易于解释的特征分析，以原则性和无监督的方式与明确定义的边界相结合，本文提出了一种物理增强的机器学习方法，将变分自编码器的能力与物理驱动的损失函数相结合，该损失函数寻求在对应于潜在表示的图像中最小化不连续性的总长度。我们的方法应用于各种材料，包括NiO-LSMO、BiFeO3和石墨烯。结果展示了我们的方法在显微镜数据中识别物理上有意义的区域和特征的有效性。",
