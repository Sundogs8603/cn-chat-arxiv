    "translated_abstract": "对于许多医疗状况，客观测量慢性瘙痒非常必要以提高患者护理水平。尽管可穿戴设备已经显示出检测搔抓的潜力，但目前无法估计搔抓强度，从而无法全面了解瘙痒对个体的影响。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个框架，用于估计搔抓强度以及检测搔抓。这通过一个多模态手环设备实现，包括一个加速度计和一个接触麦克风，一个压力敏感的平板用于捕获真实强度值，以及使用机器学习算法进行回归，将搔抓强度映射到0-10连续刻度的0-600毫瓦（mW）功率刻度。我们使用留一体外交叉验证评估了我们算法在20名个体上的性能，并使用来自其他14名参与者的数据，展示了我们的算法在临床相关鉴别上的成果。",
