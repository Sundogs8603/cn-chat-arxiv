    "translated_abstract": "在平衡供需的同时将可再生能源纳入电网是一个复杂问题，鉴于其间歇性。需求侧管理（DSM）为解决这一挑战提供了解决方案。我们提出了一种新的DSM方法，特别是控制大量电气设备遵循所需消费信号的问题。我们将其建模为一个有限时间段马尔科夫均值场控制问题。我们开发了一个新算法，MD-MFC，为凸性和Lipschitz目标函数提供理论保证。MD-MFC与现有负载控制文献的区别在于其在不使用主问题的正则化技术的情况下直接解决目标跟踪问题的有效性。镜像下降方案上的非标准Bregman距离允许使用动态规划获得简单的闭式解。此外，我们展示了一般的均值场博弈算法可以应用于此问题，从而扩展了现有技术。",
