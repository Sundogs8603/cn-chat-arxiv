    "translated_abstract": "本论文表明，一些非经典的人类决策模型可以成功地作为电路在量子计算机上运行。自20世纪60年代以来，许多观察到的认知行为已被证明违反了基于经典概率和集合论的规则。例如，问题提出的顺序会影响参与者是否回答“是”或“否”，因此回答两个问题“是”的人口不能被建模为两个固定集合的交集。然而，它可以被建模为不同顺序进行的一系列投影。这和其他示例已经成功地使用了量子概率来描述，这依赖于比较子空间之间的角度，而不是子集之间的体积。现在在2020年初，量子计算机已经达到了一定水平，一些量子认知模型可以在量子硬件上实现并研究，将心理状态表示为qubit寄存器中的状态，认知操作和决策操作通过量子门来实现。",
