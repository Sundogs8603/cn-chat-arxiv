    "abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven interpretable machine learning algorithm for semi-static hedging of Exchange Traded options, considering transaction costs with efficient run-time. Further, we provide empirical evidence on the performance of hedging longer-term National Stock Exchange (NSE) Index options using a self-replicating portfolio of shorter-term options and cash position, achieved by the automated algorithm, under different modeling assumptions and market conditions, including Covid period. We also systematically assess the model's performance using the Superior Predictive Ability (SPA) test by benchmarking against the static hedge proposed by Peter Carr and Liuren Wu and industry-standard dynamic hedging. We finally perform a thorough Profit and Loss (PnL) attribution analysis on the target option and hedge portfolios (dynamic and static) to discern the factors explaining the superior performance of static hedging.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于数据驱动的可解释机器学习算法，用于考虑交易成本的交易所交易期权的半静态对冲，实现高效的运行时间。此外，我们提供了关于使用自动化算法在不同建模假设和市场条件下对长期国家证券交易所（NSE）指数期权进行对冲的实证证据，包括Covid期间的表现。我们还通过与彼得·卡尔（Peter Carr）和刘仁钦（Liuren Wu）提出的静态对冲和行业标准动态对冲进行基准测试，系统评估了该模型的性能。最后，我们对目标期权和对冲组合（动态和静态）进行了深入的损益归因分析，以确定解释静态对冲卓越表现的因素。",
