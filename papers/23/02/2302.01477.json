    "abstract": "We study stochastic delayed feedback in general multi-agent sequential decision making, which includes bandits, single-agent Markov decision processes (MDPs), and Markov games (MGs). We propose a novel reduction-based framework, which turns any multi-batched algorithm for sequential decision making with instantaneous feedback into a sample-efficient algorithm that can handle stochastic delays in sequential decision making. By plugging different multi-batched algorithms into our framework, we provide several examples demonstrating that our framework not only matches or improves existing results for bandits, tabular MDPs, and tabular MGs, but also provides the first line of studies on delays in sequential decision making with function approximation. In summary, we provide a complete set of sharp results for multi-agent sequential decision making with delayed feedback.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一般多智能体顺序决策中的随机延迟反馈，包括赌博机问题、单智能体马尔可夫决策过程（MDPs）和马尔可夫博弈（MGs）。我们提出了一种新颖的基于规约的框架，将任何多批次算法转化为能处理顺序决策中的随机延迟的高效算法。通过将不同的多批次算法插入我们的框架中，我们提供了几个示例，证明我们的框架不仅匹配或改进了现有的赌博机、表格型MDPs和表格型MGs的结果，还首次对顺序决策中的延迟与函数逼近进行了研究。总之，我们为多智能体顺序决策中的延迟反馈提供了一套完整的尖锐结果。",
