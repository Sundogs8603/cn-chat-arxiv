The reason is that it is too slow and cumbersome to use a programming interface to create all the necessary visualizations required to identify all correlations, confounding effects, or quality control problems in a dataset. To remedy this situation, we have developed ImageNomer, a data visualization and analysis tool that allows inspection of both subject-level and cohort-level demographic, genomic, and imaging features. The software is Python-based, runs in a self-contained Docker image, and contains a browser-based GUI frontend.
