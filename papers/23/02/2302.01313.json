    "abstract": "This work provides a formalization of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) as a new class of graphs that we denote doubly exchangeable attributed graphs, where node and pairwise (joint 2-node) representations must be equivariant to permutations of both node ids and edge (& node) attributes (relations & node features). Double-permutation equivariant KG representations open a new research direction in KGs. We show that this equivariance imposes a structural representation of relations that allows neural networks to perform complex logical reasoning tasks in KGs. Finally, we introduce a general blueprint for such equivariant representations and test a simple GNN-based double-permutation equivariant neural architecture that achieve state-of-the-art Hits@10 test accuracy in the WN18RR, FB237 and NELL995 inductive KG completion tasks, and can accurately perform logical reasoning tasks that no existing methods can perform, to the best of our knowledge.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究将知识图谱(KGs)形式化为一种新型的图，并称之为双交换属性图，其中节点和二元（两个节点之间的）表示必须对节点号和边（及节点）属性（关系和节点特征）的排列等变。双重排列等变的KG表示在KG中开辟了新的研究方向。我们展示了这种等变性对关系的结构表示产生的影响，从而使神经网络能够在KG中执行复杂的逻辑推理任务。最后，我们介绍了一种通用的等变表示蓝图，并测试了一种简单的基于GNN的双排列等变神经结构，在WN18RR、FB237和NELL995归纳KG完成任务中实现了最先进的Hits@10测试准确率，并能够准确执行现有方法无法执行的逻辑推理任务。",
