    "translated_title": "(Re)$^2$H2O: 自主驾驶场景生成的反向正则化混合离线和在线强化学习",
    "translated_abstract": "自主驾驶及其广泛采用一直被寄予厚望。然而，在没有可信的全面测试程序的情况下，不仅行业难以大规模生产自主驾驶车辆(AV)，而且公众和决策者也没有说服接受创新。生成对AV具有重要挑战的安全关键场景是测试的重要第一步。现实世界的数据集包括自然但过于安全的驾驶行为，而模拟则允许无限制地探索多样化和激进的交通场景。相反，模拟中的更高维度搜索空间使得没有实际数据分布作为隐式约束的情况下效率低下。为了将两者的优点结合起来，从离线实际数据和在线模拟数据同时学习生成场景似乎是可行的。因此，我们量身打造了一个称为 (Re)$^2$H2O 的反向正则化混合离线和在线强化学习框架来实现场景生成。具体而言，离线部分使用反向 L_1 正则化来提取关键特征，并指导传输到在线学习中，以满足真实世界数据分布。在线部分则通过从离线数据学到的策略更有效地查询更高维度搜索空间中的场景。在 CARLA 模拟器和实际数据集上的实验验证了我们方法的有效性。",
    "tldr": "提出了一个新的自主驾驶场景生成框架，结合了离线实际数据和在线模拟数据，将反向 L_1 正则化用于关键特征提取，并有效地查询更高维度搜索空间中的场景，实验证明了方法的有效性。",
    "en_tdlr": "A new autonomous driving scenario generation framework is proposed, combining offline real-world and online simulation data, using reverse L_1 regularization for critical feature extraction and efficiently querying scenarios in higher-dimensional searching space, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on the CARLA simulator and real-world dataset."
