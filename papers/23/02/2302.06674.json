    "abstract": "Identifying relevant persona or knowledge for conversational systems is critical to grounded dialogue response generation. However, each grounding has been mostly researched in isolation with more practical multi-context dialogue tasks introduced in recent works. We define Persona and Knowledge Dual Context Identification as the task to identify persona and knowledge jointly for a given dialogue, which could be of elevated importance in complex multi-context dialogue settings. We develop a novel grounding retrieval method that utilizes all contexts of dialogue simultaneously. Our method requires less computational power via utilizing neural QA retrieval models. We further introduce our novel null-positive rank test which measures ranking performance on semantically dissimilar samples (i.e. hard negatives) in relation to data augmentation.",

    "translated_abstract": "鉴别与对话系统相关的角色和知识对于基于场景的对话应答生成至关重要。然而，目前每个对话基本上都是孤立研究的，而最近的工作中引入了更实际的多场景对话任务。我们将角色和知识双上下文识别定义为为给定的对话同时识别角色和知识的任务，在复杂的多场景对话设置中可能具有提升重要性。我们开发了一种新的基于检索的检索方法，可以同时利用对话的所有上下文信息。我们的方法通过使用神经问答检索模型，需要较少的计算资源。我们进一步介绍了一种新的空-正向排名测试方法，用于衡量与数据增强相关的语义差异样本（即困难负样本）的排名性能。",
