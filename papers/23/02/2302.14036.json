    "abstract": "We propose an end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system that can be trained on transcribed speech data, text-only data, or a mixture of both. The proposed model uses an integrated auxiliary block for text-based training. This block combines a non-autoregressive multi-speaker text-to-mel-spectrogram generator with a GAN-based enhancer to improve the spectrogram quality. The proposed system can generate a mel-spectrogram dynamically during training. It can be used to adapt the ASR model to a new domain by using text-only data from this domain. We demonstrate that the proposed training method significantly improves ASR accuracy compared to the system trained on transcribed speech only. It also surpasses cascade TTS systems with the vocoder in the adaptation quality and training speed.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个端到端的自动语音识别（ASR）系统，可以用转录的语音数据、仅有文本的数据或者二者的混合数据进行训练。所提出的模型使用了一种集成的文本基础训练辅助模块。该模块结合了非自回归的多说话人文本到梅尔频谱生成器和基于GAN的增强器，以提高频谱质量。该系统可以在训练过程中动态生成梅尔频谱。通过使用该新领域的仅文本数据，可以将ASR模型适应到新领域。我们证明了所提出的训练方法与仅训练于转录语音的系统相比显著提高了ASR准确性。它还在自适应质量和训练速度上超过了级联TTS系统与声码器。",
