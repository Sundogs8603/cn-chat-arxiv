    "abstract": "The goal of video motion magnification techniques is to magnify small motions in a video to reveal previously invisible or unseen movement. Its uses extend from bio-medical applications and deepfake detection to structural modal analysis and predictive maintenance. However, discerning small motion from noise is a complex task, especially when attempting to magnify very subtle, often sub-pixel movement. As a result, motion magnification techniques generally suffer from noisy and blurry outputs. This work presents a new state-of-the-art model based on the Swin Transformer, which offers better tolerance to noisy inputs as well as higher-quality outputs that exhibit less noise, blurriness, and artifacts than prior-art. Improvements in output image quality will enable more precise measurements for any application reliant on magnified video sequences, and may enable further development of video motion magnification techniques in new technical fields.",

    "translated_abstract": "视频运动放大技术的目的是放大视频中的微小运动，以揭示以前看不见的运动。它的用途从生物医学应用和深度伪造检测到结构模态分析和预测维护等领域。然而，从噪声中分辨出微小运动是一项复杂的任务，尤其是当试图放大非常微妙的、往往是亚像素运动时。因此，运动放大技术通常遭受嘈杂和模糊的输出。本文提出了一个基于Swin Transformer的最新模型，该模型对噪声输入具有更好的容错能力，输出的质量比先前的技术展现出更少的噪声、模糊和伪影。输出图像质量的改进将使任何依赖放大视频序列的应用得到更精确的测量，并可能使视频运动放大技术在新的技术领域得到进一步发展。",
