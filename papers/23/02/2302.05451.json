    "translated_abstract": "神经科学研究旨在找到准确可靠的大脑有效连接组（EC）。尽管目前的EC发现方法已经为我们理解大脑组织做出了贡献，但由于fMRI数据的样本量较小、时间分辨率较低以及大脑连接组的高维性，它们的性能受到严重限制。通过利用DTI数据作为先验知识，我们引入了两种贝叶斯因果发现框架--贝叶斯GOLEM（BGOLEM）和贝叶斯FGES（BFGES）方法--这两种方法提供了更准确可靠的EC，并解决了仅基于fMRI数据发现EC的现有因果发现方法的缺陷。通过一系列针对合成和混合（人类连接组计划（HCP）受试者的DTI与合成fMRI数据）数据的模拟研究，我们展示了所提方法在发现EC方面的有效性。为了对改进进行数值评估",
