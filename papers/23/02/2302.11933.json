    "translated_abstract": "直接与机器人进行物理交互在灵活生产场景中变得越来越重要，但没有保护栅栏的机器人对操作者的风险也更大。为了保持风险低，规定了相对简单的操作措施，例如如果有物理接触或违反安全距离则停止机器人。尽管这样可以在很大程度上避免人员受伤，但所有这些解决方案的共同点在于人与机器人之间的真正合作几乎不可能，因此无法充分发挥使用这些系统的优势。在人机协作场景中，需要更复杂的解决方案，使机器人的行为能够适应操作者和/或当前情况。最重要的是，在自由机器人移动期间，必须允许物理接触以进行有意义的交互，而不被视为碰撞。然而，这是未来机器人系统的主要挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种通过深度度量学习提高人机物理协作安全性的新方法。该方法使机器人能够学习准确捕捉人类形态和运动能力的距离度量，从而降低人机交互过程中发生碰撞和受伤的风险。我们的方法在一组基准数据集上进行了评估，并在安全性和性能方面优于现有方法。",
