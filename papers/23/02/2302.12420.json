    "translated_abstract": "长时间的作用使得老滑坡的形态特征被部分或强烈改变且与周围环境差异不大，因此老滑坡检测面临巨大挑战。此外，小样本问题也制约了深度学习的深入。本文提出了一种迭代分类和语义分割网络(ICSSN)，通过迭代升级两个共享特征提取器来大大增强目标级和像素级分类性能。在对象分类子网络中采用对象级对比学习(OCL)策略，采用连体网络实现全局特征提取；在语义分割子网络中设计了子对象级对比学习(SOCL)范式，以有效地从滑坡边界提取显著特征。此外，详细阐述了一种迭代训练策略，以在语义空间中融合特征，从而既提高目标级别分类性能，又提高像素级别的语义分割性能。",

The network utilizes an object-level contrastive learning (OCL) strategy for global feature extraction in the object classification sub-network and a sub-object-level contrastive learning (SOCL) paradigm for efficient feature extraction from landslide boundaries in the semantic segmentation sub-network. An iterative training strategy is also elaborated to fuse features in semantic space for improved object-level and pixel-level classification performance."
