In this paper, we propose an attention-based domain adaptation streamflow forecaster for data-sparse regions. Our approach leverages the hydrological characteristics of a data-rich source domain to induce effective 24hr lead-time streamflow prediction in a data-constrained target domain. Specifically, we employ a deep-learning framework leveraging domain adaptation techniques to simultaneously train streamflow predictions and discern between both domains using an adversarial method. Experiments against baseline cross-domain forecasting models show improved performance for 24hr lead-time streamflow forecasting.",

    "translated_abstract": "流量预测对于指导水资源管理、缓解洪涝灾害以及开发智慧基础设施和治理具有重要意义。然而，许多全球地区缺乏足够的流量观测数据以指导基于证据的管理策略。本文提出了一种基于注意力机制的领域自适应流量预测模型，用于数据稀缺的区域。该方法利用一个数据丰富的源领域的水文特征，采用深度学习框架结合领域自适应技术，通过对抗方法同时训练流量预测和区分两个领域。实验结果表明，该方法在24小时流量预测方面超越了传统的交叉领域模型的性能表现。",
