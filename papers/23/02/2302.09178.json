    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统在许多内容平台中扮演着重要角色。虽然大部分推荐研究致力于设计更好的模型以提高用户体验，但我们发现，针对这些模型训练稳定性的研究严重不足。随着推荐模型变得越来越大、越来越复杂，它们越容易发生训练不稳定性问题，例如损失发散，这会使模型无法使用、浪费大量资源并阻碍模型的发展。在本文中，我们分享了我们为提高 YouTube 推荐实际多任务排名模型的训练稳定性所学习到的发现和最佳实践。我们展示了一些导致训练不稳定的模型特性，并推断了原因。此外，基于我们对训练不稳定性点附近训练动态的观察，我们假设了现有解决方案失败的原因，并提出了一种新算法来缓解现有解决方案的局限",
