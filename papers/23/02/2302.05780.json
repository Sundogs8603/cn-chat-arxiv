For this reason, it is essential to detect deficits as soon as possible. Predicting financial distress in municipalities can be a complex task, as it involves understanding a wide range of factors that can affect a municipality's financial health. In this paper, we evaluate machine learning models to predict financial distress in Italian municipalities. Accounting judiciary experts have specialized knowledge and experience in evaluating the financial performance, and they use a range of indicators to make their assessments. By incorporating these indicators in the feature extraction process, we can ensure that the model is taking into account a wide range of information that is relevant to the financial health of municipalities.
