    "translated_abstract": "我们在最近由Impagliazzo等人[2022]引入的可复制性概念下设计了在统计聚类中可复制的算法。根据这个定义，如果一个聚类算法是可复制的，那么在同一分布的两个不同输入上执行时，只要其内部随机性在执行中得到共享，就能高概率地产生完全相同的样本空间分区。我们通过黑盒的方式利用组合对应问题的近似算法，为统计$k$-medians、统计$k$-means和统计$k$-centers问题提出了这样的算法。特别地，我们展示了一个可复制的$O(1)$-逼近算法，其适用于统计欧几里得$k$-medians ($k$-means)，其样本复杂度为$\\operatorname{poly}(d)$。我们还描述了一个$O(1)$-逼近算法，其在统计欧几里得$k$-centers$时具有额外的$O(1)$-加性误差，尽管其样本复杂度为$\\exp(d)$。",
