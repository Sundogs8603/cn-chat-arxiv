    "translated_abstract": "由于人体姿态数据序列的结构性质，人体姿态估计是一项具有挑战性的任务。现有方法主要集中于身体关节之间的成对交互，这对于涉及重叠关节和姿势快速变化的场景是不足够的。为了克服这些问题，我们引入了一种新的方法，即高阶有向Transformer (HDFormer)，它利用高阶骨骼和关节关系来改进姿态估计。具体而言，HDFormer结合了自我注意力和高阶注意力，形成了一个多阶注意力模块。此模块促进了第一阶“关节$\\leftrightarrow$关节”，第二阶“骨$\\leftrightarrow$关节”和高阶“超骨$\\leftrightarrow$关节”的相互作用，有效地解决了复杂和遮挡较重情况下的问题。此外，现代CNN技术被集成到基于Transformer的结构中，平衡了性能和效率之间的权衡。HDFormer在性能方面明显优于目前其他方法。",
