    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的证据表明，机器学习和深度学习方法可以学习到不同认知障碍（如老年痴呆症）个体和认知健康个体所产生的语言之间微妙的差异。TalkBank等公共数据资源已经使得计算机领域的研究人员能够联合起来，相互学习，取得了显著进展。然而，由于不同研究者使用的方法和数据选取策略的变异性，不同团体获得的结果很难直接进行比较。本文介绍了TRESTLE（\\textbf{T}oolkit for \\textbf{R}eproducible \\textbf{E}xecution of \\textbf{S}peech \\textbf{T}ext and \\textbf{L}anguage \\textbf{E}xperiments），这是一个开放源码平台，专注于从TalkBank存储库中选取两个数据集，需以老年痴呆检测为例。TRESTLE已经成功地应用于2019年信息检索国际会议Hackathon / Challenge的比赛中，在标准化和可重复实验方面为社区提供支持，为检测认知障碍的更准确和临床有效的模型提供了有用的参考。",
