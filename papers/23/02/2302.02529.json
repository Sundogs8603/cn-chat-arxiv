    "translated_abstract": "即使对于已知的非线性动力学系统，反馈控制器的综合也是一个困难的问题，通常需要利用动力学的特定结构以诱导稳定的闭环系统。对于一般的非线性模型，包括那些适用于数据的模型，可能没有足够的已知结构来可靠地综合一个稳定的反馈控制器。本文讨论了一个基于状态依赖的非线性跟踪控制器制定方案，基于一种用于一般非线性控制仿射系统的状态依赖型瑞卡蒂方程。该公式依赖于定义控制仿射动力学的向量场系统的非线性因子分解，该分解总是在温和的光滑性假设下存在。我们提出了一种从有限的数据集中学习这种分解的方法。在各种模拟非线性动力学系统上，我们通过实证来证明所学习的控制器版本在稳定的轨迹跟踪方面的功效。在我们的学习方法旁边，我们评估了所得到的闭环系统的鲁棒性、可解释性和可扩展性。",
