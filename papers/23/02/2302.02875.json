    "translated_abstract": "本文引入了一类投资项目的盈利能力度量标准，包括净现值准则（如果NPV非负，则将项目标记为弱盈利项目）、内部收益率（IRR）、盈利能力指数（PI）、回本期（PP）及其折现对应物（DPP）作为特例。介绍了该类标准及其中提及的传统标准的公设表征。该方法至少在三方面有用。首先，它提供了盈利能力指标作为针对经济环境情景集的金融稳定度量标准的统一解释。其次，它显示，在NPV准则以外，盈利指标必然不完善（即存在不可比较的项目）。特别是，这意味着将IRR扩展到所有项目空间中的任何扩展都不符合一组合理条件。为损失指标提供了类似的分类。第三，它为在不确定性下比较项目提供了一个统一的框架，其中使用期望值准则可能导致等级反转。",
