    "translated_abstract": "AI建议在投资和医疗决策等领域变得越来越流行。由于这些建议通常是不完美的，决策者必须自行决定是否实际上遵循这些建议：他们必须“适当地”依赖于正确的建议并拒绝错误的建议。然而，当前关于适当依赖的研究仍缺乏一个共同的定义以及一个操作性的测量概念。此外，还没有进行深入的行为实验来帮助理解影响这种行为的因素。在本文中，我们提出了适当依赖性（AoR）作为一个可量化的二维测量概念。我们开发了一个研究模型，分析提供AI建议解释的效果。在一项涉及200名参与者的实验中，我们展示了这些解释如何影响AoR，从而影响AI建议的有效性。我们的工作为依赖行为的分析贡献了基本概念。",
