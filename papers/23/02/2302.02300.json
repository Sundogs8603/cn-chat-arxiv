    "abstract": "In data poisoning attacks, an adversary tries to change a model's prediction by adding, modifying, or removing samples in the training data. Recently, ensemble-based approaches for obtaining provable defenses against data poisoning have been proposed where predictions are done by taking a majority vote across multiple base models. In this work, we show that merely considering the majority vote in ensemble defenses is wasteful as it does not effectively utilize available information in the logits layers of the base models. Instead, we propose Run-Off Election (ROE), a novel aggregation method based on a two-round election across the base models: In the first round, models vote for their preferred class and then a second, Run-Off election is held between the top two classes in the first round. Based on this approach, we propose DPA+ROE and FA+ROE defense methods based on Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA) and Finite Aggregation (FA) approaches from prior work. We evaluate our methods on MN",

    "translated_abstract": "在数据污染攻击中，攻击者试图通过在训练数据中添加、修改或删除样本来改变模型的预测结果。最近，提出了基于集成方法的可证明数据污染防御方法，其中预测是通过对多个基本模型进行多数表决来完成的。本文中，我们表明仅考虑集成防御中的大多数表决是浪费的，因为它没有有效地利用基本模型中的logits层中可用的信息。相反地，我们提出了运行式选举（ROE），这是一种基于基本模型之间的两轮选举的新型聚合方法：在第一轮中，模型为它们首选的类别投票，然后在第一轮中排名前两的类别之间进行第二轮“Run-Off”选举。基于这种方法，我们提出了基于先前工作中的Deep Partition Aggregation（DPA）和Finite Aggregation（FA）方法的DPA+ROE和FA+ROE防御方法。我们在MNIST数据集和CIFAR-10上评估了我们的方法，实验结果表明，我们提出的基于ROE的防御方法优于最先进的集成方法，并提供针对数据污染攻击的可证明保证",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new defense method against data poisoning called ROE, which effectively utilizes information in the logits layers of base models by conducting a two-round election. Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that ROE-based defenses outperform state-of-the-art ensemble methods and provide provable guarantees against data poisoning attacks."
