    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了检测由$n$个用户组成的两个高斯数据库$\\mathsf{X}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d}$和$\\mathsf{Y}^{n\\times d}$之间相关性的问题。我们将其作为一个假设检验问题：在零假设下，这两个数据库是统计独立的。在替代假设下，存在一个未知排列$\\sigma$（或行排列），使得$\\mathsf{X}$与$\\mathsf{Y}^\\sigma$相关。我们确定了在$n$和$d$的渐近区域下，最优检测显示出相变的尖锐阈值。具体而言，我们证明如果$\\rho^2d\\to 0$，当$d\\to \\infty$时，则无论$n$的值如何，弱检测（略优于随机猜测）是不可能的。这补充了矩阵感应模型中相位恢复的性能，该模型的目标是恢复低秩矩阵，而不是检测两个矩阵之间的相关性。",
