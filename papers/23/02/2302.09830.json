    "translated_abstract": "统计关系学习(SRL)将一阶逻辑(FOL)和概率论结合起来，用于关系数据的学习和推断。许多SRL模型中的概率推断和学习都可以简化为加权一阶模型计数(WFOMC)。然而，WFOMC被认为是不可解的（$\\mathrm{ \\# P_1-}$完全）。因此，能够允许多项式时间WFOMC的逻辑片段具有重要的研究意义。这些片段被称为“域可提升”。近期的一系列研究表明，具有计数量词($\\mathrm{C^2}$)的FOL的双变量片段是域可提升的。然而，许多真实世界数据的属性无法用$\\mathrm {C^2}$建模。实际上，许多真实世界数据的普遍属性在FOL中无法表达。无环性(acyclicity)就是这样一种属性，存在于引文网络、家谱数据、时间数据等中。本文旨在通过研究有向无环性约束的域提升能力来解决这个问题。我们证明了有向无环性约束可以被提升到$\\mathrm{C^2}$的一个扩展逻辑片段中。",
