    "translated_abstract": "非显微虹膜视网膜彩照作图 (CFP) 由于不需要瞳孔扩张的优点而广泛可用，然而由于操作员，系统缺陷或患者相关原因而容易导致质量较差。精确的医学诊断和自动分析需要最佳视网膜图像质量。因此，我们利用最优传输（OT）理论提出了非配对图像转换方案，将低质量的视网膜 CFP 映射到高质量的对应物。此外，我们通过插入在 OT 引导下训练的先验知识、将基于模型的图像重建方法，即去噪正则化，进行了泛化，从而提高了我们的图像增强流程在临床实践中的灵活性、鲁棒性和适用性。我们将此称为增强正则化 (RE)。我们在三个公开的视网膜图像数据集上验证了集成框架 OTRE 的质量评估。",
