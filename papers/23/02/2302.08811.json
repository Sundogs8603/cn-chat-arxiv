However, GNNs suffer from over-smoothing node information and, therefore, struggle to solve tasks where global graph properties are relevant. We introduce G-Signatures, a novel graph learning method that enables global graph propagation via randomized signatures. G-Signatures use a new graph conversion concept to embed graph structured information which can be interpreted as paths in latent space. We further introduce the idea of latent space path mapping. This allows us to iteratively traverse latent space paths, and, thus globally process information. G-Signatures excel at extracting and processing global graph properties, and effectively scale to large graph problems. Empirically, we confirm the advantages of G-Signatures at several classification and regression tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）已经发展成为最流行的深度学习架构之一。然而，GNNs受到过度平滑节点信息的影响，因此难以解决与全局图属性相关的任务。我们提出了一种新颖的图学习方法——G-Signatures，通过随机签名实现全局图传播。G-Signatures使用了一种新的图转换概念，将图结构化信息嵌入到可以被解释为潜在空间路径的路径中。我们进一步引入了潜在空间路径映射的概念。这使得我们能够迭代地遍历潜在空间路径，并全局地处理信息。G-Signatures在提取和处理全局图属性方面表现出色，并且能够有效地应对大规模图问题。在实证上，我们确认了G-Signatures在多个分类和回归任务中的优势。",
