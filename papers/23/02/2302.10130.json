    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型对于许多应用领域都产生了深远的影响，包括那些数据本质上是无限维的领域，如图像或时间序列。标准方法是首先离散化数据，然后将扩散模型应用于离散的数据。然而，这种方法在细化离散化参数时通常会导致算法性能下降。在本文中，我们直接在无限维度中制定基于扩散的生成模型，并将其应用于函数的生成建模。我们证明了我们的公式在无限维度环境中是良好定义的，并提供了从样本到目标测度的维度无关的距离界限。利用我们的理论，我们还制定了无限维扩散模型设计的准则。对于图像分布，这些准则与当前用于扩散模型的经典选择一致。对于其他分布...",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种在无限维度中直接制定扩散基于的生成模型的方法，相比于传统的先离散化再应用扩散模型的方法，这种方法能够避免参数细化导致算法性能下降，同时提供了维度无关的距离界限，为无限维扩散模型设计提供了准则。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel approach to directly formulate diffusion-based generative models in infinite dimensions, which avoids the performance degradation caused by parameter refinement in the traditional discretization-based method. The proposed method also provides dimension-independent distance bounds and guidelines for the design of infinite-dimensional diffusion models."
