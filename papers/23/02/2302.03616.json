    "abstract": "The effectiveness of digital treatments can be measured by requiring patients to self-report their state through applications, however, it can be overwhelming and causes disengagement. We conduct a study to explore the impact of gamification on self-reporting. Our approach involves the creation of a system to assess cognitive load (CL) through the analysis of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. The data from 11 participants is utilized to train a machine learning model to detect CL. Subsequently, we create two versions of surveys: a gamified and a traditional one. We estimate the CL experienced by other participants (13) while completing surveys. We find that CL detector performance can be enhanced via pre-training on stress detection tasks. For 10 out of 13 participants, a personalized CL detector can achieve an F1 score above 0.7. We find no difference between the gamified and non-gamified surveys in terms of CL but participants prefer the gamified version.",

    "translated_abstract": "数字化治疗的有效性可以通过要求患者通过应用程序自我报告其状态来衡量，然而，这可能会令人不知所措并导致失去参与度。我们进行了一项研究，探讨游戏化对自我报告的影响。我们的方法涉及创建一个系统，通过分析光-血容积变化信号来评估认知负荷（CL）。利用11名参与者的数据来训练机器学习模型来检测CL。随后，我们创建了两个版本的调查问卷：一个是游戏化版本，一个是传统版本。我们估计其他参与者（13名）在完成调查问卷时经历的CL。我们发现，通过预先在应激检测任务中进行预训练，可以增强CL检测器的性能。对于13名参与者中的10名，个性化CL检测器可以实现高于0.7的F1得分。我们发现，在CL方面，游戏化和非游戏化的调查问卷没有区别，但参与者更喜欢游戏化的版本。",
