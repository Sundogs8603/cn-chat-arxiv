    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱因其在自然语言处理方面的广泛应用而受到越来越多的关注。然而，它在时态问答方面的使用案例尚未得到很好的探索。现有大多数方法都基于预训练语言模型开发，这可能无法学习有关于时态知识图QA任务方面的实体的时态专用表示。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的时间感知多路自适应（TMA）融合网络。受人类逐步推理行为的启发，对于每个给定的问题，TMA首先从KG中提取相关概念，然后将其馈送到多路自适应模块以生成问题的时态特定表示。该表示可以与预先训练的KG嵌入相结合以生成最终预测。实验结果验证了所提出的模型在两个基准数据集上实现了比现有最先进方法更好的性能。",
