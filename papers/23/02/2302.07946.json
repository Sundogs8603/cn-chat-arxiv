While tools for DML (especially FL) are starting to flourish, many are not flexible and portable enough to experiment with novel processors (e.g., RISC-V), non-fully connected network topologies, and asynchronous collaboration schemes. We overcome these limitations via a domain-specific language allowing us to map DML schemes to an underlying middleware, i.e. the FastFlow parallel programming library. We experiment with it by generating different working DML schemes on x86-64 and ARM platforms and an emerging RISC-V one. We characterise the performance and energy efficiency of the presented schemes and systems. As a byproduct, we introduce a RISC-V porting of the PyTorch framework, the first publicly available to our knowledge.",

    "translated_abstract": "分散式机器学习（DML）使合作机器学习摆脱了集中式输入数据。联合学习（FL）和边缘推断是DML的示例。虽然DML工具（特别是FL）开始蓬勃发展，但许多工具不够灵活和便携，无法用于实验新型处理器（例如RISC-V），非全连接网络拓扑和异步协作方案。我们通过一种特定领域的语言克服了这些限制，将DML方案映射到基础中间件（即FastFlow并行编程库）。我们通过在x86-64和ARM平台以及新兴的RISC-V平台上生成不同的DML方案来进行实验。我们表征了所提出的方案和系统的性能和能源效率。作为附带产品，我们介绍了PyTorch框架的RISC-V移植，这是我们所知道的第一个公开可用的移植。",
