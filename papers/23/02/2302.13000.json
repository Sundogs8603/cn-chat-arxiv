    "translated_abstract": "标签分布学习（LDL）训练模型来预测一组标签（称为标签分布（LD））与实例的相关性。以前的LDL方法都假设训练实例的LD是准确的。然而，为训练实例注释高度准确的LD耗时且非常昂贵，在现实中收集到的LD通常是不准确且受注释错误干扰的。本文首次研究了不准确的LDL问题，即开发一个具有噪声LD的LDL模型。我们假设噪声LD矩阵是理想LD矩阵和稀疏噪声矩阵的线性组合。因此，不准确的LDL问题成为一个逆问题，目标是从噪声LD中恢复理想的LD和噪声矩阵。我们假设理想的LD矩阵由于标签之间的关联具有低秩性，并利用图形捕捉到的实例的局部几何结构来帮助恢复理想的LD。",
