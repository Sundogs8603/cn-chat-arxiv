    "translated_abstract": "近年来，出现了多种算法公平性的概念。其中一种概念是个体公平性(IF)，要求相似的个体接受相似的对待。与此同时，矩阵估计(ME)作为处理具有缺失值的噪声数据的一种自然范式也出现了。在这项工作中，我们将这两个概念进行了联系。我们表明，使用ME方法对数据进行预处理可以在不牺牲性能的情况下改善算法的IF。具体而言，我们表明，在适当的条件下，使用一种名为奇异值阈值(SVT)的流行ME方法对数据进行预处理可以提供强有力的IF保证。然后，我们表明，在类似的条件下，SVT预处理还产生了一致且近似最小化敌对风险的估计。因此，在所述条件下，ME预处理步骤不会增加基本算法的预测误差，即不会给公平性与性能之间带来权衡。我们通过合成数据和真实数据集验证了这些结果。",
