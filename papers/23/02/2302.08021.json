    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于离散傅里叶分析的新方法，用于分析进化算法在高原上消耗的时间。这种方法立即证明了由Garnier，Kallel，和Schoenauer（1999）提出的关于针尖问题上预期运行时间的经典估计。我们还将该方法用于分析一个新的基准问题：由$n/\\ell$个有效大小为$2^\\ell-1$的高原组成，需要以LeadingOnes的方式顺序地对其进行优化。利用我们的新方法，我们确定了静态和与适应度相关的变异率的精确预期运行时间。我们还确定了渐进最优的静态和与适应度相关的变异率。对于$\\ell = o(n)$，最优的静态变异率近似为$1.59/n$。当找到前$k$个与适应度相关的二进制位时，最优的适应度相关变异率渐进为$1/(k+1)$。到目前为止，这些结果仅证明了预期的运行时间，表明该新基准问题非常困难，而$(1+1)$进化算法在高原问题上与一般的随机搜索启发式算法相比效率惊人。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a new method based on Fourier analysis to analyze the time evolutionary algorithms spent on plateaus. The paper applies the method to Needle problem and a new benchmark problem and determines the precise expected runtime for the static and fitness-dependent mutation rates, and the asymptotically optimal static and fitness-dependent mutation rates. The paper also shows that the new benchmark problem is very hard and that the $(1+1)$ evolutionary algorithm is surprisingly efficient on plateaus compared to general randomized search heuristics."
