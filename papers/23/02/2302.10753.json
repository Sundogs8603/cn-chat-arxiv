    "translated_abstract": "异常检测技术能够对多变量时间序列数据进行有效的异常检测和诊断，对当今工业应用具有重要意义。然而，由于缺乏异常标签、数据的高维复杂性、实际硬件的内存瓶颈以及快速推理的需求，建立一个能够迅速准确定位的异常检测系统是一个具有挑战性的问题。本文提出了一种基于Transformer和双重时间卷积网络（TCN）的异常检测和诊断模型--DTAAD。我们的整体模型是一个集成设计，在此基础上，自回归模型（AR）与自编码器（AE）结构相结合，并引入了缩放方法和反馈机制，以提高预测精度和扩大相关差异。我们构建的双重TCN-Attention网络（DTA）在基准实验中仅使用了单层Transformer编码器。",
