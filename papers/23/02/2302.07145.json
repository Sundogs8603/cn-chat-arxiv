    "abstract": "In shilling attacks, an adversarial party injects a few fake user profiles into a Recommender System (RS) so that the target item can be promoted or demoted. Although much effort has been devoted to developing shilling attack methods, we find that existing approaches are still far from practical.

With the idea of Cross-system Attack, we design a Practical Cross-system Shilling Attack (PC-Attack) framework that requires little information about the victim RS model and the target RS data for conducting attacks. PC-Attack is trained to capture graph topology knowledge from public RS data in a self-supervised manner.

    "translated_abstract": "在推销攻击中，敌对方会向推荐系统注入少量的虚假用户资料，以便推广或降低目标物品的排名。尽管已经把很多的努力放在开发模拟攻击方法上，但我们发现现有方法仍然远离实用化。在本文中，我们分析了具有实用推销攻击方法的属性，并提出了跨系统攻击的新概念。具体而言，基于跨系统攻击的思想，我们设计了一个实用的跨系统推销攻击 (PC-Attack) 框架，该框架对目标推荐系统模型和目标推荐系统数据的信息需求量很小。PC-Attack 自我监督地从公共推荐系统数据中获取了图形拓扑知识。然后，我们对它进行微调，利用易于访问的部分目标数据构建虚假资料。大量实验表明，PC-Attack 优于当前最先进的基线。我们的 PC-Attack 实现",
    "tldr": "本文提出了跨系统推销攻击的新概念，设计了一个名为 PC-Attack 的实用框架。这个框架只需要很少的受害者推荐系统模型和目标推荐系统数据的信息即可进行攻击，并在公共推荐系统数据上进行了自我监督训练和微调，因此攻击成功率较高。",

PC-Attack is trained in a self-supervised manner on public RS data and fine-tuned on a small portion of target data to construct fake profiles, achieving a high success rate in attacks."
