    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了FTX数字货币交易所在2022年11月失败的原因。我们认为Terra-Luna生态系统的崩溃是导致该交易所流动性显著降低的关键事件。通过分析链上数据，我们报告了FTX严重依赖于借贷和滥用其原生代币FTT，并展示了这种行为如何加剧了公司脆弱的财务状况。为了进一步了解这种衰落，我们以小时为基础研究了199种加密货币的进化依赖结构，并调查了事件发生时的公共交易。结果表明，币安的推文积极加速了崩溃，引起了加密市场的系统反应。最后，本文确定了从FTX的崩溃中最受益的参与者，并强调了加密空间向中心化趋势的重要性，强调了对于透明和弹性的金融体系来说，真正分散化的金融的重要性。",
