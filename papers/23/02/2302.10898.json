Driving assistance systems that support drivers by adapting individual psychological characteristics can provide appropriate feedback and prevent traffic accidents. As a first step toward implementing such adaptive assistance systems, this research aims to develop a model to estimate drivers' psychological characteristics, such as cognitive function, psychological driving style, and workload sensitivity, from on-road driving behavioral data using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
