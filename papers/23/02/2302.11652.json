    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个通用的框架，设计和分析了两种资产之间的交易机制，统一并比较了常函数市场制造商（CFMMs）和限价订单簿（LOBs）两种主流交易范式。在我们的框架中，每个流动性提供者（LP）向交易所提交一个向下倾斜的需求曲线，指定其希望在每个价格上持有的风险资产数量; 交易所买卖风险资产以满足提交的需求的总量。通常，这种机制是预算平衡的，并能实现价格发现。不同的交易机制对应于对可接受需求曲线集的不同限制。本文的主要目标是形式化一种贯穿交易机制设计的近似复杂度权衡。例如，CFMMs在表达力方面做出了妥协，以简洁为优：LPs的聚合需求曲线可以用常数空间描述，",
