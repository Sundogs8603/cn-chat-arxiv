This work revisits the training framework and uncovers two major problems hindering the expressiveness of learned multi-interest representations.

    "translated_abstract": "现有的推荐系统中多兴趣候选匹配的研究主要关注于改进模型架构或整合额外信息，忽视了训练方案的重要性。本研究重新审视了训练框架，发现了两个主要问题，阻碍了多兴趣表示的表达能力。首先，当前的训练目标（即均匀采样的softmax）在多兴趣学习场景中无法有效训练有区分性的表示，因为易样本数量剧增。其次，观察到了一种路由崩溃问题，每个学习到的兴趣可能坍缩为仅表达来自单个项目的信息，导致信息丢失。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了REMI框架，包括兴趣感知的难负样本挖掘策略（IHN）和路由正规化方法（RR）。IHN通过提出理想的采样分布强调兴趣感知的难负样本。",
