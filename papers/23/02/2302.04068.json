    "translated_abstract": "在2022年11月，Aave社区的焦虑水平激增，因为Avi Eisenberg对Aave进行了攻击。 Eisenberg试图通过在协议上借款人为的方式，空头CRV代币，人为压低CRV的价值。尽管攻击最终失败了，它仍让Aave社区感到害怕，甚至引起了关于去中心化治理下大型借贷平台可行性的疑问。本文分析了Avi Eisenberg的行动，展示了他如何通过在去中心化和中心化交易所上将大量借来的CRV卖出稳定币，人为降低CRV的价格。尽管攻击未遂，但仍导致超过150万美元的不可挽回的债务，从而使该协议不可挽回的债务增加了四倍。此外，我们强调他的攻击是由于可供借用的CRV比例过大，以及Aave的借贷协议设计阻碍了快速干预而被启用。",
