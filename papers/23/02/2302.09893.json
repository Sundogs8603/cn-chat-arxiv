    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于新颖的变分自动编码器（HVAE）的符号回归方法，用于生成层级结构。它将简单的原子单元与共享权重相结合，以递归地编码和解码层级中的各个节点。编码是自下而上进行的，解码是自上而下进行的。我们实验上证明了HVAE可以在数学表达式的小语料库上高效地进行训练，并可以将表达式准确地编码成平滑的低维潜在空间。后者可以通过各种优化方法高效地进行探索，以解决符号回归的任务。事实上，通过HVAE的潜在空间进行随机搜索比通过手工设计的数学表达式的随机搜索效果更好。最后，应用进化算法到HVAE的潜在空间中的EDHiE系统可以更好地从标准符号回归基准中重建方程。",
