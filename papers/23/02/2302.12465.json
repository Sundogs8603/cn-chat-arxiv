    "translated_abstract": "透明度和问责制已成为黑箱机器学习模型的主要问题。模型行为的适当解释增加了模型的透明度，并帮助研究人员开发更负责任的模型。图神经网络（GNN）最近在许多图形ML问题中表现出优越性能，解释它们已引起了越来越多的关注。然而，在链接预测（LP）方面，GNN的解释尚缺少文献支持。 LP是一项基本的GNN任务，对应于Web上的推荐和赞助搜索等应用程序。鉴于现有的GNN解释方法仅解决节点/图级任务，我们提出了一种基于路径的GNN解释方法，用于异构链接预测（PaGE-Link），该方法生成具有连接可解释性的解释，具有模型可扩展性和处理图形异构性能力。定性地，PaGE-Link可以生成将节点对连接起来的路径作为解释，自然地捕捉到连接关系。",
