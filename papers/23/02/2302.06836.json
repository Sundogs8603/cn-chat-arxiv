    "abstract": "ML-based program cost models have been shown to yield fairly accurate program cost predictions. They can replace heavily-engineered analytical program cost models in mainstream compilers, but their black-box nature discourages their adoption. In this work, we propose the first framework, COMET, for generating faithful, generalizable, and intuitive explanations for x86 cost models. COMET brings interpretability specifically to ML-based cost models, such as Ithemal. We generate and compare COMET's explanations for Ithemal against COMET's explanations for a hand-crafted, accurate analytical model, uiCA. Our empirical findings show an inverse correlation between the error in the cost prediction of a cost model and the prominence of semantically-richer features in COMET's explanations for the cost model for a given x86 basic block.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于机器学习的程序成本模型已被证明可以提供相当准确的程序成本预测。它们可以取代主流编译器中经过大量工程设计的分析性程序成本模型，但它们的黑匣子本质阻碍了它们的采用。在本研究中，我们提出了第一个框架，COMET，用于为x86成本模型生成忠实、可推广和直观的解释。COMET将可解释性特别引入ML-based成本模型，例如Ithemal。我们生成并比较Ithemal的COMET解释与手工精细的分析模型uiCA的COMET解释。我们的实证发现显示在给定的x86基本块的成本模型的COMET解释中，语义更丰富的特征的突出程度与成本预测误差呈负相关。",
