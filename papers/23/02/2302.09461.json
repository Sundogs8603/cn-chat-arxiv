    "abstract": "Previous anti-spoofing methods have used either pseudo maps or user-defined labels, and the performance of each approach depends on the accuracy of the third party networks generating pseudo maps and the way in which the users define the labels. In this paper, we propose a liveness score-based regression network for overcoming the dependency on third party networks and users. First, we introduce a new labeling technique, called pseudo-discretized label encoding for generating discretized labels indicating the amount of information related to real images. Secondly, we suggest the expected liveness score based on a regression network for training the difference between the proposed supervision and the expected liveness score. Finally, extensive experiments were conducted on four face anti-spoofing benchmarks to verify our proposed method on both intra-and cross-dataset tests. The experimental results show our approach outperforms previous methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "先前的反欺诈方法是使用伪地图或用户定义标签，每种方法的表现都依赖于第三方网络生成伪地图的准确性以及用户定义标签的方式。本文提出了一种基于活体得分的回归网络来克服对第三方网络和用户的依赖。首先，我们引入了一种新的标签技术，称为伪分离标签编码，用于产生表示与真实图像相关的信息量的离散化标签。其次，我们提出了期望的活体得分，基于回归网络训练提出的监督和期望的活体得分的差异。最后，在四个面部反欺诈基准测试上进行了大量实验，验证了我们提出的方法在内和跨数据集测试中的有效性。实验结果表明，我们的方法优于以前的方法。",
