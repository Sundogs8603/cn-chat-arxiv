In this work, we propose two generalizations of the ARHMM. First, we propose a more general AR dynamics in Cartesian space, described as a linear combination of non-linear basis functions. Second, we propose a linear dynamics in unit quaternion space, in order to properly describe orientations. These extensions allow to describe more complex dynamics of the observed state.  Although this extension is proposed for the ARHMM, it can be easily extended to other latent variable models with AR dynamics in the observed space, such as Auto-Regressive Hidden semi-Markov Models.",

    "translated_abstract": "潜变量模型广泛应用于机器人技术、语音识别和经济学等不同领域的时间序列非监督分割。其中最广泛使用的潜变量模型是自回归隐马尔可夫模型(ARHMM)，它将由马尔可夫链动力学控制的潜在模态与观测状态的线性自回归动力学相结合。本文提出了ARHMM的两个推广。首先，我们提出了笛卡尔空间中更一般的自回归动力学，它被描述为非线性基函数的线性组合。其次，我们提出了单位四元数空间中的线性动力学，以正确描述方向。这些扩展允许描述观察状态的更复杂动力学。虽然此扩展是针对ARHMM提出的，但易于扩展到其他具有观测空间中自回归动力学的潜变量模型，例如自回归隐半马尔可夫模型。",
