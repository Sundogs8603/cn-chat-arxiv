    "translated_abstract": "科技的进步推动了城市区域的不断扩张，全世界私人车辆数量相应增加，其中韩国也不例外。这种车辆数量逐步增加也带来了与停车有关的问题，其中包括为残疾人指定的残疾人停车位被滥用。传统的车牌识别系统由于监控摄像头高帧率、自然和人为噪声的存在以及光照和天气条件的变化而导致实时检测和识别效率低下，难以有效解决这些问题。本文提出了SHINE，一个基于深度学习的无障碍停车管理系统，用于实时无障碍性监测和识别停放在无障碍停车位上的车辆。SHINE由两个主要组件组成：基于深度卷积神经网络的车牌识别系统和无障碍停车管理系统。此外，我们提供了一个数据集，包括从4个不同时段拍摄的21个无障碍停车位的4,780张图像，以评估SHINE的性能。实验结果表明，SHINE优于现有的车牌识别系统，在识别率和可访问性监测方面都达到了令人满意的结果。",
