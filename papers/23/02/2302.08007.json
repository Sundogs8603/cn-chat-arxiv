    "abstract": "This paper introduces Block Data Representations (BDR), a framework for exploring and evaluating a wide spectrum of narrow-precision formats for deep learning. It enables comparison of popular quantization standards, and through BDR, new formats based on shared microexponents (MX) are identified, which outperform other state-of-the-art quantization approaches, including narrow-precision floating-point and block floating-point. MX utilizes multiple levels of quantization scaling with ultra-fine scaling factors based on shared microexponents in the hardware. The effectiveness of MX is demonstrated on real-world models including large-scale generative pretraining and inferencing, and production-scale recommendation systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种名为模块数据表示（BDR）的框架，用于探索和评估一系列用于深度学习的窄精度格式。它能够比较流行的量化标准，并通过BDR，发现了一种基于共享微指数（MX）的新格式，其优于其他最先进的量化方法，包括窄精度浮点和块浮点。MX 在硬件中利用多个量化级别，使用基于共享微指数的超细缩放因子。MX 的有效性在包括大规模生成预训练和推理以及生产规模推荐系统在内的实际模型上得到了证明。",
