    "translated_abstract": "新闻文章的政治立场预测已被广泛研究，以减轻回声室效应，即人们落入其思想，强化其现有信念。以往关于政治立场问题的研究重点在于（1）识别可以反映新闻文章政治立场的政治因素和（2）有效地捕捉这些因素。尽管它们在经验上成功了，但在政治立场预测中其识别的因素的有效性没有得到充分证明。在此基础上，本文通过用户研究调查政治立场预测中的重要因素，并观察到新闻文章的环境和语调（隐含）以及文章中涉及的现实实体的外部知识（显式）在确定其政治立场方面是重要的。基于这一观察结果，我们提出了一种新颖的知识感知政治立场预测方法（KHAN），采用（1）层次化注意力网络有效地捕捉新闻文章中的关键信息，（2）外部知识库提供关于文章中提到的实体的额外信息，以及（3）知识感知损失函数学习优先考虑重要信息。多个数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的方法显著优于现有方法。",
