    "translated_abstract": "结构学习是人工智能中的一个核心问题，对神经符号学习和统计关系学习领域至关重要。它包括从数据中自动学习逻辑理论的过程。结构学习的基础是挖掘数据中的重复模式，即结构模体。发现这些模式可降低搜索空间，并引导公式的学习。尽管模体学习非常重要，但它仍不为人们所理解。我们提出了一种基于随机过程的，针对提升图形模型中矿结构模体的原则性方法，这些模型将一阶逻辑与概率模型结合在一起。我们的第一个创新是一种算法，它依赖于两个直观的超参数：一个控制实体相似性度量中的不确定性，以及一个控制生成规则的柔软度。第二个贡献是预处理步骤，通过分层聚类将相似的实体分组。最后，我们在基准数据集上展示了我们方法的有效性。",
