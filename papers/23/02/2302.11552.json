    "translated_abstract": "自从扩散模型问世以来，它在许多领域中已经迅速成为生成模型的主要方法。它们可以被解释为学习一系列时变的对数概率密度函数的梯度。这种解释已经激发了基于分类器和无分类器指导的思想成为后续控制扩散模型的方法。在这项工作中，我们建立在这些想法的基础上，利用扩散模型的分数-based解释，探索了用于涉及组合生成和指导的条件、修改和重复使用扩散模型的替代方法。特别是，我们调查了为什么某些类型的组合使用当前技术失败，并介绍了一些解决方案。我们得出结论，采样者(而不是模型)对此失败负有责任，并提出了新的采样器，受MCMC的启发，使组合生成成功。此外，我们提出了一种基于能量的扩散模型参数化方法，它使得逼近目标分布更加容易。",
