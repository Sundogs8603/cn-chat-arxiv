    "translated_abstract": "人类在线交流数量正在迅速增长。但是，社交媒体平台、消息应用程序和其他数字论坛上的基于文本的互动可能会产生分裂和冲突。这种有毒性增加了极化的程度，并且重要的是，侵蚀了多元化社会发展解决影响所有人的复杂社会问题的能力。学者和民间社会组织推动干预措施，使面对面的对话不那么具有分裂性或更具生产力，但将这些努力扩展至在线发生的许多话语是极具挑战性的。我们展示了一个大规模实验的结果，该实验证明了人工智能工具如何改善关于分裂性话题的在线对话。具体而言，我们采用大型语言模型实时提供基于证据的建议，以改善参与者在对话中感受到理解的感觉。我们发现这些建议确实可以帮助人们改善对话质量。",
