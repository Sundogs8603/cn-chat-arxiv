    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络(DNN)在动力学系统建模方面表现出极大的能力；然而，它们通常不遵守物理约束，如守恒定律。本文提出了一种名为ConCerNet的新的学习框架，以提高基于DNN的动力学建模的可靠性，赋予不变的属性。ConCerNet由两个步骤组成:(i)对比学习方法，自动捕捉轨迹观测中的系统不变量(即守恒性质)；(ii)神经投影层，保证学习到的动力学模型保留学习到的不变量。我们从理论上证明了学习到的潜在表示和未知系统不变量函数之间的功能关系。实验表明，我们的方法在坐标误差和守恒指标方面始终比基线神经网络表现出更好的效果。使用基于神经网络的参数化且不依赖于先前知识，我们的方法在动力学方面具有广阔的应用前景。",
