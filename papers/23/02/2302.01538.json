    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习的快速发展在各个领域，特别是在固体力学中解决偏微分方程(PDE)方面产生了显著影响，极大地受益于神经网络的优异逼近能力。物理启发神经网络(PINNs)和深度能量方法(DEM)在解决PDE方面受到了广泛关注。最小势能原理和互补能量原理是固体力学中两个重要的变分原理。然而，DEM是基于最小势能原理，但它缺乏最小互补能量的重要形式。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了基于最小互补能量原理的深度互补能量方法(DCEM)。DCEM的输出函数是应力函数。我们将DCEM扩展到DCEM-Plus (DCEM-P)，添加满足偏微分方程的项。此外，我们还提出了一种深度互补能量算子的方法。",
