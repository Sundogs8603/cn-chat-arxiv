    "translated_abstract": "最近，学习协同多智能体强化学习中的通信策略引起了广泛关注。早期的研究通常假设智能体之间有完全连接的通信拓扑结构，导致高昂的通信成本并且不切实际。近期的一些工作已经发展出了自适应通信策略以减少通信开销，但这些方法无法有效地获取超出通信范围之外的智能体宝贵的信息。在本文中，我们考虑到每个智能体具有有限的通信范围以及通信拓扑实时动态变化的情况。为了有效地实现智能体之间的通信，我们提出了一种新的通信协议，称为自适应控制的两跳通信(AC2C)。在初始的局部通信之后，AC2C采用自适应的两跳通信策略，以实现智能体之间的长距离信息交流，以提高性能，而这是仅通过局部通信难以实现的。我们在各种任务环境中验证了所提出方法的有效性，并表明AC2C在学习效率和可扩展性方面优于现有的通信方法。",
