    "translated_abstract": "人体活动识别是康复、健康监测和人机交互等应用的核心技术。可穿戴设备，尤其是IMU传感器，以相对较低的成本提供了丰富的人体运动特征，可用于活动识别。开发鲁棒的活动识别分类器一直是研究人员关注的一个主要问题。主要问题之一是通常存在训练数据不足的问题，这使得开发深度分类器变得困难，有时甚至不可能。在本文中，开发了一种新颖的GAN网络TheraGAN，用于生成与康复活动相关的IMU信号。生成的信号包括来自6个通道的IMU数据，即角速度和线性加速度。此外，引入简单活动简化了不同长度活动的生成过程。为了评估生成的信号，进行了几个定性实验和定量实验。",
