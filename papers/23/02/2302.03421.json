    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个框架，用于推导PAC-Bayesian泛化界限。与大多数关于此主题的文献不同，我们的界限是任何时间都有效的（即时间均匀的），这意味着它们适用于所有停止时间，而不仅仅是固定的样本大小。我们的方法按照以下顺序结合了四种工具：（a）非负超马丁格尔或反向亚马逊，（b）混合法，（c）Donsker-Varadhan公式（或其它凸性对偶原理）和（d）Ville不等式。我们的主要成果是一个PAC-Bayes定理，适用于广泛的离散随机过程类。我们展示了这个结果如何推出知名的经典PAC-Bayes界限，例如Seeger、McAllester、Maurer和Catoni的界限，以及许多最新的界限。我们还提出了几个新的界限。我们的框架还使我们能够放松传统的假设；特别地，我们考虑非平稳损失函数和非独立同分布的数据。",
