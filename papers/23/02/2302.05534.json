Unlike previous work, we do not assume the low-tier and high-tier tasks share the same dynamics or reward functions, and focus on robust knowledge transfer without prior knowledge on the task similarity. We identify a natural and necessary condition called the ``Optimal Value Dominance'' for our objective. Under this condition, we propose novel online learning algorithms such that, for the high-tier task, it can achieve constant regret on partial states depending on the task similarity and retain near-optimal regret when the two tasks are dissimilar, while for the low-tier task, it can keep near-optimal without making sacrifice. Moreover, we further study the setting with multiple low-tier tasks",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了层级增强学习设置，这是一个并行传输学习框架，在这个框架中，目标是将知识从低层（源）任务传输到高层（目标）任务，以减少后者的探索风险，同时并行解决这两个任务。与先前的工作不同，我们不假设低层和高层任务共享相同的动态或奖励函数，并且专注于在没有先验知识的任务相似性的情况下实现强大的知识传输。我们确定了一个称为“最优值支配”的自然而必要的条件，适用于我们的目标。在这个条件下，我们提出了一种新颖的在线学习算法，使得对于高层任务，在部分状态上可以实现恒定的遗憾，这取决于任务相似性，并在两个任务不相似时保持接近最优遗憾；而对于低层任务，它可以在不做出牺牲的情况下保持接近最优。此外，我们进一步研究了具有多个低层任务的情况。",
