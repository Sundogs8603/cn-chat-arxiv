    "translated_abstract": "在在线市场中，顾客可以获得某个产品的数百条评论。买家经常使用来自与他们具有相同属性的其他顾客的评论来估算他们可能之前并不了解的产品价值，比如衣物的身高、护肤品的肤质和户外家具的地理位置。由于缺乏相关评论，有些顾客可能会犹豫是否购买，除非价格低，因此对于卖家来说，设定高价格和确保有足够的评论让买家能够自信地估算产品价值之间存在着一种紧张关系。同时，卖家也可以利用评论来衡量他们希望销售的商品的需求。在这项工作中，我们研究了在线环境中的这个定价问题，其中卖家与一系列不同类型的买家逐一交互，在一系列的T轮中进行。在每一轮中，卖家首先设定一个价格，然后一个买家到达并查看具有相同类型的先前买家的评论，这些评论透露了那些买家对产品的评价。",
