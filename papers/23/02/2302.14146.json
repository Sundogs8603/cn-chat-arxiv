    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了最近提出的逻辑信任网络的语言，特别是调查不同马尔科夫条件的后果。我们引入了逻辑信任网络的结构概念，并展示了没有有向循环的结构将导致一个众所周知的因子分解结果。对于带有有向循环的网络，我们分析了马尔科夫条件、因子分解结果和规范要求之间的差异。",

We show that a structure without directed cycles leads to a well-known factorization result, while networks with directed cycles require special consideration of different Markov conditions."
