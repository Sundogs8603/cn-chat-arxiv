    "translated_abstract": "张量补全在计算机视觉、数据分析和信号处理等领域中具有重要意义。最近，低秩张量补全这一类别的方法得到了广泛研究，对补全张量施加低秩结构。虽然这些方法取得了巨大成功，但尚未考虑到张量元素的数值先验信息。忽略数值先验将导致丢失关于数据的重要信息，因此阻止算法达到最优精度。本研究试图构建一个新的方法框架，名为GCDTC（广义CP分解张量补全），以利用数值先验并实现更高的张量补全精度。在这个新引入的框架中，将广义的CP分解应用于低秩张量补全。本文还提出了一种名为SPTC（平滑泊松张量补全）的算法，用于非负整数张量补全，作为GCDTC框架的一个实现。通过对合成和真实世界数据集的大量实验，证明所提出的方法相比于现有技术具有更优的张量补全性能。",
