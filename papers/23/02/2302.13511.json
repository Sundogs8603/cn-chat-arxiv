    "translated_abstract": "集成方法，如Bagging和随机森林在各个领域中随处可见，从金融到基因组学。尽管它们很常见，但关于有效调整集成参数的问题却受到相对较少的关注。本文介绍了一种交叉验证方法，即ECV（外推交叉验证），用于调整随机集成中的集成和子样本大小。我们的方法基于两个主要因素: 使用Out-of-Bag错误来获取小型集成的初步估计值和一种利用预测风险分解结构的新型风险外推技术。通过证明我们的风险外推技术在集成和子样本大小上具有统一的一致性，我们表明ECV对于平方预测风险能够产生$\\delta$-最优（关于Oracle调整风险）。我们的理论适用于一般的集成预测器，只需要温和的矩假设，并允许具有高维度特征的情况。",
