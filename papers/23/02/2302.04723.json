    "abstract": "Context: Requirements engineering researchers have been experimenting with machine learning and deep learning approaches for a range of RE tasks, such as requirements classification, requirements tracing, ambiguity detection, and modelling. However, most of today's ML/DL approaches are based on supervised learning techniques, meaning that they need to be trained using a large amount of task-specific labelled training data. This constraint poses an enormous challenge to RE researchers, as the lack of labelled data makes it difficult for them to fully exploit the benefit of advanced ML/DL technologies. Objective: This paper addresses this problem by showing how a zero-shot learning approach can be used for requirements classification without using any labelled training data. We focus on the classification task because many RE tasks can be framed as classification problems. Method: The ZSL approach used in our study employs contextual word-embeddings and transformer-based language models.",

    "translated_abstract": "需求工程研究人员一直在尝试使用机器学习和深度学习方法来完成一系列RE任务，例如需求分类、需求追踪、歧义检测和建模。然而，今天大部分的ML / DL方法都基于监督学习技术，这意味着它们需要使用大量的任务特定标记训练数据进行训练。这个限制对RE研究人员提出了巨大挑战，因为标记数据的缺乏使得他们难以充分利用先进的ML / DL技术的优势。本文旨在解决这个问题，展示如何使用零样本学习方法进行需求分类，而无需使用任何标记的训练数据。我们着重于分类任务，因为许多RE任务可以被框定为分类问题。本研究中使用的ZSL方法采用上下文单词嵌入和基于变压器的语言模型。",
