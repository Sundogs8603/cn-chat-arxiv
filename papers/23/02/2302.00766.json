    "translated_abstract": "针对具有加性各向同性噪声的Langevin动力学的隐私保护特性已经得到了广泛的研究。然而，各向同性噪声假设非常严格：（a）在为了保护隐私并保持最佳准确性而向现有学习算法添加噪声时，应考虑输出的相对幅度和它们之间的相关性；（b）流行的算法，如随机梯度下降（及其连续时间极限），似乎具有各向异性的协方差特性。要研究各向异性噪声情况下的隐私风险，需要关于具有不同漂移和扩散系数的两个随机微分方程之间的相对熵的一般结果。我们的主要贡献是通过功能不等式利用对Fokker-Planck方程的解的稳定性估计来建立这样的边界。在附加假设的情况下，相对熵边界意味着一个$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential的风险。",
