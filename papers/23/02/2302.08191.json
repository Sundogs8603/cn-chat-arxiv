    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络是一种强大的基于图的推荐系统学习方法。最近，将对比学习与GNN结合在推荐系统中使用，在处理高度稀疏的数据方面采取数据增强方案，已经显示出超越其他方法的性能。尽管在其成功的基础上，现有的图对比学习方法大多要么在用户-物品交互图上执行随机扰动(例如节点/边扰动)，要么依赖于启发式的增强技术(例如用户聚类)来生成对比视图。本文认为，这些方法不能很好地保持内在的语义结构，并且很容易受到噪音扰动的影响。为此，本文提出了一种称为LightGCL的简单而有效的图对比学习范式，解决了对比学习模型因噪音而失去通用性和鲁棒性的问题。我们的模型仅使用奇异值分解进行对比增强，使其更好地保留了内在的语义结构。",
