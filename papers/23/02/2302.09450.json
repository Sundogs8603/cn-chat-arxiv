We present a reinforcement learning framework for training a robot to accomplish a large variety of jumping tasks, such as jumping to different locations and directions. To improve performance on these challenging tasks, we develop a new policy structure that encodes the robot's long-term input/output (I/O) history while also providing direct access to a short-term I/O history. In order to train a versatile jumping policy, we utilize a multi-stage training scheme that includes different training stages for different objectives. After multi-stage training, the policy can be directly transferred to a real bipedal Cassie robot. Training on different tasks and exploring more diverse scenarios lead to highly robust policies that can exploit the diverse set of learned maneuvers to recover from perturbations or poor land",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在通过使扭矩控制的双足机器人在实际环境中进行稳健且多用途的跳跃，将双足机器人的敏捷性提升到极限。我们提出了一个强化学习框架，用于训练机器人完成各种跳跃任务，如跳向不同的位置和方向。为了提高在这些具有挑战性的任务上的表现，我们开发了一种新的策略结构，它编码了机器人的长期输入/输出 (I/O) 历史记录，同时还提供了对短期 I/O 历史记录的直接访问。为了训练具有多用途跳跃策略，我们使用了一个多阶段的训练方案，其中包括不同目标的不同训练阶段。在多阶段训练之后，该策略可以直接转移到真实的双足 Cassie 机器人上。对不同任务进行训练和探索更多样化的情景会导致高度稳健的策略，这些策略可以利用所学习的各种机动方式来从扰动或不良着陆中恢复过来。",
