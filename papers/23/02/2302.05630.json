To address this, we propose a novel method, called CILP, that formulates the VM provisioning problem as two sub-problems of prediction and optimization, where the provisioning plan is optimized based on predicted workload demands.

    "translated_abstract": "在云计算环境中，智能虚拟机（VM）的调配是实现成本和资源有效计算的关键。由于VM的引导会消耗大量时间，对于延迟关键任务来说，主要挑战是预测未来的工作负载需求以主动调配虚拟机。然而，现有的基于人工智能的解决方案往往没有全面考虑所有关键方面，例如调配开销、异构VM成本以及云系统的服务质量（QoS）。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新方法，称为CILP，将VM调配问题分解为预测和优化两个子问题，其中根据预测的工作负载需求优化调配计划。CILP利用神经网络作为代理模型，预测未来的工作负载需求，并利用协同仿真数字孪生设施来计算QoS评分。我们扩展了神经网络，使其也作为一个模仿学习器，动态决定最佳的VM调配计划。",
