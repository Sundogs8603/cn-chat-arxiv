    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）在节点分类任务中取得了巨大成功。然而，现有的GNN自然偏向于具有更多标记数据的多数类，并忽略那些具有相对较少标记数据的少数类。传统的技术往往采用过采样方法，但可能会导致过拟合问题。最近的一些工作提出从标记节点中合成少数类的附加节点，然而，并没有保证这些生成的节点真正代表相应的少数类。事实上，不恰当地合成节点可能导致算法的泛化能力不足。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种自动从图的大量未标记节点中增强少数类的方法——GraphSR。具体来说，我们提出了一种新颖的自训练策略，通过使用具有显著差异的未标记节点增加少数类，该策略基于相似度。",
