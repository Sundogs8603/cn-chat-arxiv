Light curtains are a controllable depth sensor that sense only along a surface that the user selects. We adapt a probabilistic method based on particle filters and occupancy grids to explicitly estimate the position and velocity of 3D points in the scene using partial measurements made by light curtains. The central challenge is to decide where to place the light curtain to accurately perform this task. We propose multiple curtain placement strategies guided by maximizing information gain and verifying predicted object locations. Then, we combine these strategies using an online learning framework. We propose a novel self-supervised reward function that evaluates the accuracy of current velocity estimate",

    "translated_abstract": "为了在环境中进行安全和自主的导航，机器人必须准确地估计障碍物的位置和移动方式。本文探索了使用成本更低、速度更快、分辨率更高的可编程光幕的替代方案，而非使用昂贵的传统3D传感器。我们采用基于粒子滤波器和占据栅格的概率方法，使用光幕进行部分测量并明确估计场景中3D点的位置和速度。最大的挑战是决定光幕的放置位置，以准确执行此任务。我们提出了多种光幕放置策略，通过最大化信息增益和验证预测的对象位置进行指导。然后，我们使用在线学习框架将这些策略组合起来。我们提出了一种新颖的自监督奖励函数，评估当前速度估计的准确性。",

Multiple placement strategies for the curtains are proposed and combined using an online learning framework, guided by maximizing information gain and verifying predicted object locations. A novel self-supervised reward function is also introduced to evaluate the accuracy of velocity estimates."
