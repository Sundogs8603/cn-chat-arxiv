    "translated_abstract": "近十年来，公共和私人部门的金融犯罪数量激增，2022年金融机构的诈骗平均成本为1.02亿美元。开发一种打击金融犯罪的机制是一个紧迫的任务，需要多个机构深度合作，然而这样的合作由于分布式金融数据的隐私和安全要求而带来了重大的技术挑战。本文收集并预处理了多家银行的大规模金融数据集，提出了一种混合联合学习框架，结合中心化和分布式学习的优点，在保护隐私的同时检测金融犯罪。所提出的框架利用隐私保护聚合器，并通过利用中心模型作为分布式学习过程热身来增强联合学习的效率。我们在实际数据集上展示了我们框架的有效性，并证明了我们的方法在保护数据隐私的同时，精确度优于中心化和联合学习方法。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种隐私保护混合联合学习框架，它结合中心化和分布式学习的优点，可以用于检测金融犯罪并保护数据隐私。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a privacy-preserving hybrid federated learning framework that combines the strengths of central and distributed learning to detect financial crimes while preserving data privacy. The framework utilizes a privacy-preserving aggregator and enhances the efficiency of federated learning by utilizing a central model as a warm-up for the distributed learning process."
