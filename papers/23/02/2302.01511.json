    "translated_abstract": "高斯过程上置信界限(GP-UCB)是一种理论上很有前途的黑盒优化方法；然而，在定理中置信参数$\\beta$相当大，并在实践中以试探性的方式选择。 随机GP-UCB(RGP-UCB)使用一个遵循Gamma分布的随机置信参数来减轻手动指定$\\beta$的影响。本研究首先将RGP-UCB的遗憾分析推广到更广泛的分布类中，包括Gamma分布。此外，我们提出了基于双参数指数分布的改进型RGP-UCB(IRGP-UCB)，它实现了更紧密的贝叶斯遗憾界限。IRGP-UCB不需要在迭代次数方面增加置信参数,从而避免了后期过度探索。最后，我们通过大量实验证明了IRGP-UCB的有效性。",
