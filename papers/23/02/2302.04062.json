    "abstract": "Data plays a crucial role in machine learning. However, in real-world applications, there are several problems with data, e.g., data are of low quality; a limited number of data points lead to under-fitting of the machine learning model; it is hard to access the data due to privacy, safety and regulatory concerns. Synthetic data generation offers a promising new avenue, as it can be shared and used in ways that real-world data cannot. This paper systematically reviews the existing works that leverage machine learning models for synthetic data generation. Specifically, we discuss the synthetic data generation works from several perspectives: (i) applications, including computer vision, speech, natural language, healthcare, and business; (ii) machine learning methods, particularly neural network architectures and deep generative models; (iii) privacy and fairness issue.

    "translated_abstract": "数据在机器学习中发挥着关键作用。然而，在实际应用中，数据存在多种问题，如数据质量低，有限的数据点导致机器学习模型欠拟合，由于隐私、安全和监管问题难以访问数据。合成数据生成提供了一种有前途的新途径，因为它可以以真实世界数据无法做到的方式进行共享和使用。本文系统地回顾了利用机器学习模型进行合成数据生成的现有工作。具体而言，我们从以下几个方面讨论合成数据生成的工作：（i）应用，包括计算机视觉、语音、自然语言、医疗保健和商业；（ii）机器学习方法，特别是神经网络架构和深度生成模型；（iii）隐私和公平问题。此外，我们还确定了这一新兴领域的挑战和机遇，并提出了未来的研究方向。",
