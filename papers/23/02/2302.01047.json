    "translated_abstract": "当前连续学习方法的评估通常假设在训练时间和计算方面没有限制。这对于任何实际世界的环境都是不现实的。因此我们提出了一种实时评估连续学习的方法，其中流不等待模型完成训练即揭示下一个数据进行预测。为了实现这一点，我们从计算成本的角度评估当前的CL方法，并在包含3900万个时间戳标记图像的大型数据集CLOC上进行了广泛的实验。结果表明，在这种评估下，一个简单的基线模型胜过了最先进的CL方法，这对现有方法在现实环境中的适用性提出了质疑。另外，我们还探讨了文献中常用的各种CL组件，包括记忆采样策略和正则化方法。我们发现，所有考虑的方法都无法与我们的简单基线模型竞争。",
