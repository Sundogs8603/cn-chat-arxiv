    "translated_abstract": "少样本学习是一种有前途的分子性质预测方法，因为监督数据通常非常有限。然而，许多重要的分子性质取决于复杂的分子特征，如分子可能具有的各种三维几何形状或其可能形成的化学相互作用类型，这些特征在特征空间中并未明确编码，必须从少量数据中近似。学习这些特征可能很困难，尤其是对于设计用于快速适应新任务的少样本学习算法。在这项工作中，我们开发了一种能够编码复杂分子特征的分子嵌入，以提高少样本分子性质预测的性能。我们的方法利用大量的合成数据，即分子对接计算的结果，以及多任务学习范式来构建嵌入空间。在多个分子性质预测基准上，从嵌入空间进行训练取得了良好的结果。",
