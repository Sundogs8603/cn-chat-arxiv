    "translated_abstract": "给定一个矩阵$M\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$，低秩矩阵补全问题要求我们通过只观察一组指定的条目$\\Omega\\subseteq [m]\\times [n]$来找到$M$的秩为$k$的近似$UV^\\top$，其中$U\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times k}$，$V\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times k}$。本文主要研究了一种被广泛使用的方法--交替最小化框架。Jain、Netrapalli和Sanghavi~\\cite{jns13}证明了如果$M$的行和列是不相干的，那么交替最小化方法可以通过观察几乎线性数量的条目可靠地恢复矩阵$M$。虽然样本复杂度之后被改进~\\cite{glz17}，但交替最小化步骤要求精确计算。这阻碍了更高效算法的开发，并未描述交替最小化的实际实现，其中更新通常是近似执行，以提高效率。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种在几乎线性时间内用鲁棒交替最小化方法完成低秩矩阵补全的方法，并证明了观察几乎线性数量的条目即可恢复矩阵$M$，此方法克服了交替最小化方法需要精确计算的限制，更符合实际实现中对效率的要求。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method for completing low rank matrix using robust alternating minimization in nearly linear time. The method is proved to recover the matrix using a nearly linear number of observed entries. It overcomes the limitation of exact computation in alternating minimization and is more practical for efficient implementation."
