This creates barriers to applications of CoT prompting to these general tasks. This paper proposes a new strategy, Automate-CoT (Automatic Prompt Augmentation and Selection with Chain-of-Thought), that can bypass human engineering of CoTs by automatically augmenting rational chains from a small labeled dataset, and then pruning low-quality chains to construct a candidate pool of machine-generated rationale chains based on the labels.

    "translated_abstract": "Chain-of-thought prompting（CoT）推进了大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理能力，在算术、常识和符号推理任务中取得了优越性能。然而，大多数CoT研究依赖于精心设计的人工注释的合理链，以提示语言模型，这对于现实世界中存在标记的训练数据但没有人工注释的合理链的应用构成了挑战。这为CoT提示应用于这些通用任务带来了障碍。本文提出了一种新策略，Automate-CoT（自动提示增强与选择与链思），可以通过从小型标记数据集中自动增强合理链，然后修剪低质量链，基于标签构建基于机器生成的理由链的候选池。最后，它选择了几个理由链的最佳组合。",
