In the proposed method, a SR network is jointly trained with a binary segmentation network in an end-to-end manner. This joint learning allows the SR network to be optimized for improving segmentation results. For realistic scenarios, the SR network is extended from non-blind to blind for processing a low-resolution image degraded by unknown blurs. The joint network is improved by our proposed two extra paths that further encourage the mutual optimization between SR and segmentation. Comparative experiments with State of The Art (SoTA) segmentation methods demonstrate the superiority of our joint learning, and various ablation studies prove the effects of our contributions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种由深度神经网络增强的裂缝分割方法，通过超分辨率（SR）进行增强。在所提出的方法中，SR网络与二值分割网络联合进行端到端训练。这种联合学习使得SR网络能够被优化以改善分割结果。针对现实场景，SR网络从非盲目扩展到盲目处理由未知模糊引起的低分辨率图像。通过我们提出的两个额外路径进一步鼓励SR和分割之间的相互优化，改进了联合网络。与现有技术（SoTA）分割方法的比较实验表明我们联合学习的优越性，各种消融研究证明了我们贡献的效果。",
