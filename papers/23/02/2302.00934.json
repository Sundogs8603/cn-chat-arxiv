    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的变量聚类模型，称为渐近独立块 (AI-block) 模型，该模型基于群集间多变量平稳混合随机过程的极大值的独立性来定义种群水平的群集。该模型类是可识别的，意味着存在一种偏序关系，允许进行统计推断。我们还提出了一种算法，无需事先指定群集的数量即可恢复变量的群集。我们的工作提供了一些理论洞察，证明了在某些条件下，我们的算法能够在计算复杂性在维度中是多项式的情况下有效地识别数据中的群集。这意味着可以非参数地学习出仅仅是亚渐近的依赖过程的块最大值的群组。为了进一步说明我们的工作的重要性，我们将我们的方法应用于神经科学数据集。",
