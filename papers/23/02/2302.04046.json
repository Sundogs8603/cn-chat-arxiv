    "translated_abstract": "分布式数据分析引擎（如Spark）是工业界处理海量数据的常用选择。然而，Spark SQL 的性能高度依赖于配置的选择，其中最优配置随执行的工作负载而变化。在众多的 Spark SQL 调优方案中，贝叶斯优化（BO）是一种流行的框架，可以在给定足够预算的情况下找到接近最优的配置，但它受到重新优化问题的影响，在实际生产中不实用。当应用转移学习来加速调优过程时，我们注意到两个领域特定的挑战：1）大多数之前的工作都集中在传递调优历史记录方面，而来自 Spark 工程师的专业知识具有极大的潜力来改善调优性能，但迄今为止尚未得到充分研究；2）应该仔细利用历史任务，其中使用不相似的任务会导致生产中的性能下降。在本文中，我们介绍了 Rover，一种已部署的在线 Spark SQL 调优服务，",
