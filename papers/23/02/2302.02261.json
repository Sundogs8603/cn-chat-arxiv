    "translated_abstract": "深度学习(DL)在各个行业中被广泛应用于改善决策和自动化流程，其推动力来自不断发展的DL库和编译器。DL系统的正确性对于信任DL应用非常重要。因此，最近的研究浪潮一直在研究用于模糊DL系统的自动化测试用例合成（即DNN模型和其输入）。然而，现有的模型生成器只涵盖了有限数量的操作符，缺乏广泛建模操作符约束的能力。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了NeuRI，一种全自动生成由数百种操作符组成的有效且多样化的DL模型的方法。NeuRI采用了三步过程：(i)从各种来源收集有效和无效的API追踪；(ii)在追踪数据上应用归纳式程序合成，推断构建有效模型的约束条件；(iii)通过结合符号和具体操作执行混合模型生成。",
