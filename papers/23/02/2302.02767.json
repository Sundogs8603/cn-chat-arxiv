    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新的度量方法来研究企业的产品专业化：产品核心度，它捕捉了出口产品在企业出口篮子中的中心地位。我们使用2018年至2020年哥伦比亚、厄瓜多尔和秘鲁的企业-产品级别数据研究了产品核心度。我们的分析得出了三个主要发现。首先，企业出口篮子的组成在一年之内变化相对较小，与企业核心能力相距较远、核心度较低的产品更有可能被剔除。其次，更高的核心度与企业级别更大的出口流量有关。第三，这种企业级别的模式也对总体水平产生影响：平均而言，与更高核心度一起出口的产品在国家级别上具有更高的出口流量，这在所有产品复杂性水平上都成立。因此，本文表明一个产品与企业能力的契合程度对企业和国家的经济表现都很重要。",
