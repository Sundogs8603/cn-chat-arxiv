    "translated_abstract": "最近关于环境分布设计的研究已经展示出训练有效的通用能力代理的前景。它的成功部分在于一种自适应课程学习的形式，该形式通过生成代理能力的前沿环境实例（或级别）。然而，这种环境设计框架经常在具有挑战性的设计空间中发现有效级别方面存在困难，并需要与环境进行高成本交互。本文的目的是在非监督环境设计（UED）框架中引入多样性。具体来说，我们提出了一种任务不可知的方法来识别对给定级别具有代表性的观察/隐藏状态。然后利用这种方法的结果来表征两个级别之间的多样性，正如我们所展示的，这对于有效性能至关重要。此外，为了提高采样效率，我们加入了自我对战技术，使得环境生成器能够自动生成环境。",
