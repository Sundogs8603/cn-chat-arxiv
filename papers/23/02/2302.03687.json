    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在样本分层实验中对平均处理效应进行协变量调整的方法。我们在一个通用的框架中工作，包括匹配元组设计、粗分层设计和完全随机化设计作为特例。已知对于完全随机化设计，协变量调整与处理-协变量交互项可以弱化效率。然而，我们发现，对于分层设计，这种回归估计量通常是低效的，甚至可能相对于未调整的基准估计量增加估计方差。在此结果的基础上，我们推导出针对给定分层的渐近最优线性协变量调整。我们构建了几个可行的估计器，以使大样本中实现这种高效调整。例如，在匹配对的特例中，包括处理、协变量和对固定效应的回归在渐近上是最优的。我们还提供了新颖的渐近精确推断方法。",
