    "translated_abstract": "样本外预测是预测模型的一项重要测试，然而独立的测试数据集通常不可用于评估预测误差。因此，通常使用数据拆分算法（如交叉验证或自助法）来估计样本外表现。对于定量结果，可解释的方差与总方差的比率可以通过确定系数或样本内$R^2$来总结，这易于解释并可在不同结果变量之间进行比较。与样本内$R^2$相反，样本外$R^2$没有很好地定义，样本外$\\hat{R}^2$的变异性被大量忽视。通常仅报告其点估计值，这阻碍了不同结果变量可预测性的正式比较。在本文中，我们明确将样本外$R^2$定义为两个预测模型的比较，并提供无偏估计器，利用最近关于数据不确定性的理论进展。",
