The results using difference-in-differences show that the monthly wages of Brazilians in Roraima increased by around 2 percent, which was mostly driven by those working in sectors and occupations with no refugee involvement. The study finds negligible job displacement for Brazilians but finds evidence of native workers moving to occupations without immigrants. We also find that immigrants in the informal market offset the substitution effects in the formal market.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们利用巴西正式工人普遍使用的行政面板数据，研究了委内瑞拉危机对巴西劳动力市场的影响，重点关注边境州罗赖马。差异处理结果表明，罗赖马州的巴西人月工资增长了约2％，主要是由那些从事没有难民参与的部门和职业的人驱动的。研究发现，巴西人几乎没有失业，但发现本地工人转移到没有移民的职业。我们还发现，非正规市场中的移民抵消了正规市场中的替代效应。",
