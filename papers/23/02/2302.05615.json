    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习（SSL）最近在3D医学图像分析任务中取得了有希望的性能。大多数当前方法遵循原本设计用于照片或自然图像的现有SSL范式，无法明确地和彻底地利用不同医学图像中内在的相似解剖结构。这实际上可能通过最大化包含空间不对齐信息和不同解剖语义的特征之间的相似性来降低所学深度表示的质量。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的自监督学习框架，名为Alice，通过巧妙地结合辨别目标和生成目标，明确地实现了解剖不变性建模和语义对齐。Alice引入了一种新的对比学习策略，鼓励不同来源但具有一致高级语义的视图之间的相似性，以学习不变的解剖特征。此外，我们设计了一种共生学习策略，将潜在噪声图像与良性图像进行对比，从而提高了自监督学习的性能。",
