    "translated_abstract": "二分图表示学习的基本挑战是如何提取有信息量的节点嵌入。自监督学习 (SSL) 是解决这一挑战的一种有希望的范式。最近的二分图 SSL 方法大多基于对比学习，在区分正负节点对的基础上学习嵌入。然而，对比学习通常需要大量负节点对，这可能导致计算负担和语义错误。本文介绍了一种新的协同表示学习模型 (STERLING)，可以在没有负节点对的情况下学习节点嵌入。STERLING 保留了二分图中的独特局部和全局协同性。局部协同性通过最大化跨类型和同类型正节点对的相似性来捕捉，全局协同性则通过最大化共聚簇的互信息来捕捉。理论分析表明 STERLING 可以提高连接性。",
