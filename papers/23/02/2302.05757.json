    "translated_abstract": "对比学习方法已广泛应用于各领域和模态，通过训练模型识别数据点的相似“视图”。然而，专业的科学模态对这种范式 pose challenge，因为为每个科学仪器识别好的视图是复杂和耗时的。在这篇论文中，我们专注于将对比学习方法应用于各种遥感数据集。我们展示了Viewmaker网络，这是一种最近提出的生成视图的方法，很有前途地能够在不需要大量领域知识和试错的情况下在这一领域内产生视图。我们将Viewmaker应用于四个多光谱成像问题，每个问题具有不同的格式，发现在下游分类任务的评估中，在每种情况下Viewmaker都可以优于基于裁剪和反射的对比学习方法。这进一步证明了领域不可知的方法可以使对比学习扩展到实际的科学应用规模。",
