    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了因子场，一种用于建模和表示信号的新框架。因子场将信号分解为因子的乘积，每个因子由神经场或常规场表示，并对输入信号进行坐标变换操作。我们展示了这种分解产生了一个统一的框架，可以概括多种最近的信号表示方法，包括NeRF，PlenOxels，EG3D，Instant-NGP和TensoRF。此外，这个框架还可以创建强大的新信号表示，例如本文提出的系数基函数分解（CoBaFa）。通过实验，我们证明CoBaFa相较于之前的快速重建方法在神经信号表示的三个关键目标：逼近质量，紧凑性和效率方面有所改进。在二维图像回归任务中，我们实验证明我们的表示可以获得更好的图像逼近质量，同时在几何质量方面也更高。",
