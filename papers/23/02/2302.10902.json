    "translated_abstract": "在多元时间序列（MTS）数据中填补缺失值对于确保数据质量和生成可靠的数据驱动预测模型至关重要。除了许多统计方法外，近期一些研究提出了最先进的深度学习方法来填补MTS数据中的缺失值。然而，这些深度方法的评估仅局限于一个或两个数据集、较低的缺失率和完全随机的缺失值类型。本文对五个时间序列健康数据集进行了六个数据中心实验，对最先进的深度填补方法进行基准测试。我们广泛的分析表明，没有一种单一的填补方法在所有五个数据集上表现最好。填补效果取决于数据类型、单个变量统计、缺失值率和类型。在时间序列数据中同时进行交叉剖面（跨变量）和纵向（跨时间）缺失值填补的深度学习方法产生了统计学上的最佳性能。",
