    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种基于梯度的方法来解决贝叶斯最佳实验设计问题，以在批处理设置下学习因果模型，这是从有限数据中发现因果关系的关键组成部分，而干预可能是昂贵或有风险的。现有方法依赖于贪婪逼近来构建一批实验，同时使用黑盒方法来优化单个目标状态对的干预。在这项工作中，我们完全放弃了黑盒优化技术和贪婪启发式方法，而是提出了一个概念上简单的端到端梯度优化过程，以获取一组最优的干涉目标状态对。这样的过程能够对设计空间进行参数化，从而有效地优化一批多目标状态干预，这是由于其复杂性而迄今未被探索的设置。我们证明了我们提出的方法在单目标和多目标实验设计问题中都优于基线和现有的获取策略。",
