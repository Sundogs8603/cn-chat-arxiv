    "translated_abstract": "现代射电天文仪器产生大量数据，日益复杂的射电频率干扰(RFI)环境需要更加复杂的RFI拒绝算法。对于瞬变和技术信号的搜索具有“大海捞针”的特性，我们需要开发可以确定感兴趣信号是否具有独特属性或是否属于某个更大的有害RFI集合的方法。过去，这种审查需要耗时耗力地手动检查大量的信号。在本文中，我们提出了一种快速和模块化的深度学习算法，用于在射电频谱数据中搜索类似感兴趣信号。首先，我们使用能量检测算法返回的信号对B-Variational Autoencoder进行了训练。然后，我们从经典的Transformer架构中适应了一个位置嵌入层，来嵌入附加的元数据，我们通过使用基于频率的嵌入进行了演示。接下来，我们使用了B-V的编码器组件。",

The algorithm trains a B-Variational Autoencoder and utilizes a positional embedding layer and additional metadata to enhance the search process. It alleviates the burden of manual signal inspection."
