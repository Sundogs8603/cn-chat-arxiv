    "abstract": "The war in Ukraine seems to have positively changed the attitude toward the critical societal topic of migration in Europe -- at least towards refugees from Ukraine.

For this purpose, we combine and adapt leading-edge automatic text processing for a novel multilingual stance detection approach. Starting from 5.5M Twitter posts published by 565 European news outlets in one year, beginning September 2021, plus replies, we perform a multilingual analysis of migration-related media coverage and associated social media interaction for Europe and selected European countries.  The results of our analysis show that there is actually a reframing of the discussion illustrated by the terminology change, e.g., from \"migrant\" to \"refugee\", often even accentuated with phrases such as \"real refugees",

    "translated_abstract": "乌克兰战争似乎积极改变了欧洲对移民这一关键社会议题的态度——至少对来自乌克兰的难民来说如此。本研究调查了该议题在网络新闻和社交媒体上的反映，以此将网上的议题表达与社会对其的感知联系起来。为此，我们结合并改编了领先的自动文本处理技术，采用新型的多语言立场检测方法。从2021年9月开始的一年内，我们获得了565家欧洲新闻机构发布的550万条推特帖子和回复，进行了关于移民相关的媒体报道和相关社交媒体互动的多语言分析。我们的分析结果表明，实际上存在一种讨论重塑，可以通过术语的变化来说明，例如，从“移民”到“难民”，甚至常常强调“真正的难民”。",
    "tldr": "乌克兰危机引起了欧洲对移民议题态度的变化，特别是对来自乌克兰的难民。研究者运用多语言分析技术对新闻和社交媒体上的相关报道进行研究，发现了一种对移民议题讨论的重构。",
    "en_tdlr": "The Ukrainian crisis has brought about a change in Europe's attitude towards the issue of migration, particularly towards refugees from Ukraine. Using multilingual analysis techniques, the researchers studied relevant news and social media coverage and found a reframing of the discussion on the topic of migration."
