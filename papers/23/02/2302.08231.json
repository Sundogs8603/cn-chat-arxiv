Therefore we propose 3M3D: A Multi-view, Multi-path, Multi-representation for 3D Object Detection where we update both multi-view features and query features to enhance the representation of the scene in both fine panoramic view and coarse global view. Firstly, we update multi-view features by multi-view axis self-attention. It will incorporate panoramic information in the multi-view features and enhance understanding of the global scene.

    "translated_abstract": "基于多相机图像的三维视觉感知任务对于自动驾驶系统至关重要。最新的研究在这一领域通过利用多视图图像作为输入，并通过交叉注意多视图特征来迭代增强物体查询（物体候选）。然而，个体主干特征不会通过多视图特征进行更新，而仅仅保持作为单一图像主干网络输出的集合。因此，我们提出了3M3D：一种用于三维物体检测的多视图、多路径、多表示方法，在细粒度全景视图和粗粒度全局视图中同时更新多视图特征和查询特征，以增强场景的表示。首先，我们通过多视图轴自注意力机制更新多视图特征。它将全景信息融入多视图特征中，增强对全局场景的理解。其次，我们通过感兴趣区域（ROI）的自注意力机制来更新多视图特征。",
