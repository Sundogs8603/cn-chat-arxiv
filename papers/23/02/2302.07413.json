    "abstract": "We present a practical guide for the analysis of regression discontinuity (RD) designs in biomedical contexts. We begin by introducing key concepts, assumptions, and estimands within both the continuity-based framework and the local randomization framework. We then discuss modern estimation and inference methods within both frameworks, including approaches for bandwidth or local neighborhood selection, optimal treatment effect point estimation, and robust bias-corrected inference methods for uncertainty quantification. We also overview empirical falsification tests that can be used to support key assumptions. Our discussion focuses on two particular features that are relevant in biomedical research: (i) fuzzy RD designs, which often arise when therapeutic treatments are based on clinical guidelines but patients with scores near the cutoff are treated contrary to the assignment rule; and (ii) RD designs with discrete scores, which are ubiquitous in biomedical applications.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一份实践指南，旨在介绍医疗背景下回归不连续性设计的分析。我们首先介绍连续性框架和局部随机化框架中的关键概念、假设和估计方法。然后讨论这两个框架中的现代估计和推断方法，包括带宽或局部邻域选择方法、最优治疗效应点估计方法以及用于不确定性量化的鲁棒偏差校正推断方法。我们还概述了可用于支持关键假设的经验性假设检验。我们的讨论重点关注两个在生物医学研究中具有相关性的特征：（i）模糊的回归不连续设计，这经常出现在治疗方法基于临床指南但得分接近临界值的患者会根据其他规则接受治疗时；（ii）具有离散分数的回归不连续设计，在生物医学应用中普遍存在。",
