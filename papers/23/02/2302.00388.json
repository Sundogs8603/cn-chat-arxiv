To produce predictions with error bars in this setting, we consider Gaussian processes (GPs) for modelling and predicting solar photovoltaic energy production in the UK. A standard application of GP regression on the PV timeseries data is infeasible due to the large data size and non-Gaussianity of PV readings.

    "translated_abstract": "对于电站运营管理而言，太阳能光伏能源（PV）产量的短期预测非常重要。理想情况下，这些预测应该带有误差范围，使得下游决策可以考虑到不确定性。为了在这种情况下产生带有误差范围的预测，我们考虑使用高斯过程 (GPs) 来对英国太阳能光伏能源生产进行建模和预测。由于 PV 的数据量大且 PV 读数不服从高斯分布，所以标准 GP 回归模型难以实现。然而，借助最近高斯过程大规模推理的进展，特别是使用 GPs 的状态空间形式，以及现代变分推理技术，可以实现这一目标。因此，得到的模型不仅适用于大型数据集，而且还可以通过卡尔曼滤波处理连续数据流。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出一种利用状态空间高斯过程进行太阳能光伏能源生产短期预测和滤波的方法，通过结合现代变分推理技术，在处理大规模和非高斯分布数据时具有较高的可扩展性和准确性，有望为电站运营管理提供更加准确的决策依据。",

By combining modern variational inference techniques, this model is scalable and accurate in handling large-scale and non-Gaussian distribution data, potentially providing more accurate decision-making for powerplant management."
