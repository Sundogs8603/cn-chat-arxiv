    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了减小精细分类错误严重性的问题。精细分类常常具有挑战性，主要是因为需要领域专业知识进行准确标注。相比较而言，人类在进行粗粒度分类时特别擅长，因为这需要相对较低的专业水平。为此，我们提出了一种名为Hierarchical Ensembles (HiE)的后期纠正方法，利用标签层级来改善在测试期间使用粗粒度预测的精细分类性能。通过仅要求叶节点的父节点，我们的方法显著减少了平均错误严重性，同时在iNaturalist-19和tieredImageNet-H数据集上提高了top-1准确率，实现了这两个基准测试的新的最先进结果。我们还研究了我们的方法在半监督设置中的有效性。我们的方法在显著降低错误严重性的同时，带来了显著的top-1准确率提升。",
