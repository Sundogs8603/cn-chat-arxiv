    "translated_abstract": "空间对象常常伴随着文本信息，例如包含它们描述的兴趣点 (POIs)，这被称为地理-文本数据。为了检索这样的数据，已经广泛研究了同时考虑空间接近性和文本关联性的空间关键字查询。为空间关键字查询设计的现有索引大多基于地理-文本数据构建，而没有考虑已经收到的查询的分布。然而，先前的研究表明，利用已知的查询分布可以改进未来查询处理的索引结构。在本文中，我们提出了 WISK，一种用于空间关键字查询的学习索引，它自适应于优化查询成本，给定一个查询工作负载。其中一个关键挑战是如何在学习索引时利用结构化的空间属性和非结构化的文本信息。我们首先将数据对象划分为分区，旨在最小化给定查询工作负载的处理成本。然后，我们提出了一种基于模型的方法，通过考虑已经接收到的查询的分布来学习空间关键字查询的最优划分方案和索引结构。我们在真实的地理-文本数据集上进行的实验表明，WISK在查询延迟方面优于现有的索引，同时保持竞争性的索引大小。",
