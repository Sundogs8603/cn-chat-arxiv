    "abstract": "Understanding how language supports emotion inference remains a topic of debate in emotion science. The present study investigated whether language-derived emotion-concept knowledge would causally support emotion inference by manipulating the language-specific knowledge representations in large language models. Using the prompt technique, 14 attributes of emotion concepts were found to be represented by distinct artificial neuron populations. By manipulating these attribute-related neurons, the majority of the emotion inference tasks showed performance deterioration compared to random manipulations. The attribute-specific performance deterioration was related to the importance of different attributes in human mental space. Our findings provide causal evidence in support of a language-based mechanism for emotion inference and highlight the contributions of emotion-concept knowledge.",

    "translated_abstract": "在情绪科学中，如何理解语言支持情绪推断仍然是一个争议的话题。本研究通过操纵大型语言模型中的语言衍生的情绪概念知识表示，调查了语言是否会因果支持情绪推断。使用提示技术，发现了14个情绪概念的属性由不同的人工神经元群体表示。通过操纵这些属性相关的神经元，与随机操纵相比，大多数情绪推断任务的表现出现了下降。属性特定的表现下降与人类心理空间中不同属性的重要性有关。我们的发现提供了支持基于语言的情绪推断机制的因果证据，并强调了情绪概念知识的贡献。",
