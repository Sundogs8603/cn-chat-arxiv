    "translated_abstract": "为了为6G网络实现智能、可编程和多厂商的无线电接入网络（RAN），在标准化和开放式RAN（O-RAN）的发展中做出了相当的努力。然而，迄今为止，O-RAN在控制和优化RAN功能方面的适用性尚未得到广泛研究。本文同时优化流量分割分布、拥塞控制和调度（JFCS），以实现O-RAN中的智能流量转发应用。结合网络效用最大化和随机优化的工具，我们引入了一个多层优化框架，提供快速收敛、长期效用最优化和显著的延迟降低，与现有技术和基准RAN方法相比。我们的主要贡献有三个: i) 我们提出了新颖的JFCS框架，可高效且自适应地将流量引导到适当的无线电单元; ii) 我们基于强化学习开发了低复杂度算法，inne",
