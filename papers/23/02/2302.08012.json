    "abstract": "We propose modeling real-world data markets, where sellers post fixed prices and buyers are free to purchase from any set of sellers, as a simultaneous-move game between the buyers. A key component of this model is the negative externality buyers induce on one another due to purchasing data with a competitive advantage, a phenomenon exacerbated by data's easy replicability. We consider two settings. In the simpler complete-information setting, where all buyers know their valuations, we characterize both the existence and welfare properties of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in the presence of buyer externality. While this picture is bleak without any market intervention, reinforcing the limitations of current data markets, we prove that for a standard class of externality functions, market intervention in the form of a transaction cost can lead to a pure-strategy equilibrium with strong welfare guarantees. We next consider a more general setting where buyers start with unknown valua",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出将现实世界中的数据市场建模为一个买家之间的同时移动博弈，其中卖家发布固定价格，而买家可以自由地从任何一组卖家购买。该模型的一个关键组成部分是买家通过购买具有竞争优势的数据对彼此产生的负外部性，这种现象因数据易于复制而加剧。我们考虑了两种情况。在更简单的完全信息设置中，我们确定了存在于存在买家外部性的纯策略纳什均衡的福利性质。我们证明，对于一类标准的外部性函数，以交易成本的形式的市场干预可以导致强福利保证的纯策略均衡。接着，我们考虑买家起始估价未知的更一般情况。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文研究了固定价格数据市场中的买家之间的竞争策略，发现其中存在负面影响。文章揭示了买家之间的负外部性及其影响，并提出了相应的市场干预措施，实现了纯策略均衡，并保证了强福利性质。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the competition strategies among buyers in fixed-price data markets and finds negative externality effects. The paper reveals the negative externality among buyers and its impact, and proposes corresponding market intervention measures to achieve pure-strategy equilibrium and ensure strong welfare properties."
