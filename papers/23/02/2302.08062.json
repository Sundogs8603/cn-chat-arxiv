    "translated_abstract": "化石物种的识别对于进化研究至关重要。近期深度学习的进展在化石图像识别方面显示出了很有前景的发展。然而，由于化石保存、有条件采样以及领域专家昂贵且不一致的标签注释的限制，标记化石图像的数量和质量通常都受到限制，从而给使用基于深度学习的图像分类模型训练带来了巨大挑战。为了解决这些问题，我们遵循“群众的智慧”的思想，提出了一个多视角集成框架，通过收集每个化石图像的原始视图、灰度视图和骨架视图来训练多个基础模型，并通过软投票进行最终决策。在包含2400张图像的最大造针螺化石数据集上的实验证明，所提出的OGS方法始终优于基线方法（针对每个视图使用单一模型），并且在性能上优于或可与OOO方法相媲美（使用三个原始视图模型）。",
