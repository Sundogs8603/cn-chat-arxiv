    "translated_abstract": "许多可解释的人工智能（XAI）可视化工具已经被开发出来，但它们通常需要用户进一步推理来解释。我们认为，XAI应该支持图解型和假设性推理，以便AI能够进行假设生成和评估，从而减少可解释性差距。我们提出了图解化方法，以i)进行Peircean推导-演绎推理，ii)遵循领域惯例，和iii)用图示或语言进行解释。我们在临床应用领域实现了DiagramNet，以预测心脏听诊中的心脏诊断，并用基于形状的杂音图解进行解释。在建模研究中，我们发现DiagramNet不仅提供了忠实的杂音形状解释，而且比基线模型具有更好的预测性能。我们进一步通过医学生的定性用户研究展示了图解型解释的可理解性和可信度，并表明在临床相关的情况下，图解式解释比其他方式更受推崇。",
