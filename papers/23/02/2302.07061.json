    "translated_abstract": "分子构象生成是药物研发中的一个基本和重要的问题。许多传统方法已经被开发来解决MCG问题，例如系统搜索、模型构建、随机搜索、距离几何、分子动力学、蒙特卡罗方法等等。然而，它们在不同的分子结构上存在一些局限性。最近，有许多基于深度学习的MCG方法声称它们在很大程度上优于传统方法。然而，令人惊讶的是，我们设计了一个简单且廉价的算法（无需参数），基于传统方法，发现它与基于深度学习的MCG方法在广泛使用的GEOM-QM9和GEOM-Drugs基准测试中可相媲美甚至更好。特别是，我们的设计算法只是RDKIT生成构象的聚类。我们希望我们的发现能帮助社区修正MCG中的深度学习方法。所提出算法的代码可在https://gis找到。",
