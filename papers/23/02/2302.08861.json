    "translated_abstract": "稀疏重建是MRI中的重要方面，有助于减少采集时间并提高时空分辨率。目前流行的方法主要基于压缩感知技术（CS），它依赖于对k空间的随机采样来产生不相干的（噪声样的）伪影。由于硬件限制，1D笛卡尔相编码的欠采样方案在2D CS-MRI中很受欢迎。然而，1D欠采样限制了测量之间的2D不相干性，产生结构化的别名伪影（幽灵），在假设2D稀疏模型时可能难以去除。重建算法通常针对这些与方向相关的伪影采用不考虑方向的2D正则化方法。我们发现相编码伪影可以分离为连续的1D信号，因此开发了两种解耦技术，使得能够进行明确的1D正则化并利用出色的1D不相干特性。我们还推导出一个结合了1D+2D重建技术的方法，充分利用了稀疏性模型和多方向特点。",

By developing two decoupling techniques, it enables explicit 1D regularization for aliasing artefacts with excellent 1D incoherence characteristics. The method also combines 1D and 2D reconstruction techniques, taking advantage of the sparsity model and multi-directional features."
