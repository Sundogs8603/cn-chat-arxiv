    "translated_abstract": "阿尔茨海默病（AD）是渐进性神经退行性疾病，是痴呆的主要原因。早期诊断对患者从潜在的干预和治疗中获益至关重要。视网膜因其与大脑的解剖联系，被假定为 AD 检测的诊断部位。然而相关的 AI 模型尚未提供关于决策的合理解释，也无法推断疾病进展的阶段。因此，我们提出了一个新颖的模型无关的可解释性 AI 框架，称为 Granular Neuron-level Explainer（LAVA），它是一个解释原型，可以探测卷积神经网络（CNN）模型的中间层以直接从视网膜成像中评估 AD 进程。本方法应用于验证视网膜血管系统为 AD 评估的生物标志物和诊断手段。通过 UK Biobank 认知测试和血管鉴定。",
