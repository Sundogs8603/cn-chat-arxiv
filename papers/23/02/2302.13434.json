    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于骨骼的人体动作成为了热门的研究课题，因为人体骨骼的紧凑表达给这个研究领域注入了新活力。因此，研究者开始注意到使用RGB或其他传感器来通过提取骨骼信息分析人体动作的重要性。利用深度学习的快速发展，最近提出了许多基于骨骼的人体动作方法，这些方法都有精心设计的深度学习结构。然而，一个训练良好的深度学习模型总是需要高质量和充足的数据，而这往往需要高昂的费用和人力资源。本文介绍了一种新颖的基于骨骼动作识别任务的数据增强方法，该方法可以有效生成高质量和多样化的序列动作。为了获得自然和逼真的动作序列，我们提出了去噪扩散概率模型（DDPMs），它可以生成一系列合成动作序列。",
