    "abstract": "We survey recent work on machine learning (ML) techniques for selecting cutting planes (or cuts) in mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Despite the availability of various classes of cuts, the task of choosing a set of cuts to add to the linear programming (LP) relaxation at a given node of the branch-and-bound (B&B) tree has defied both formal and heuristic solutions to date. ML offers a promising approach for improving the cut selection process by using data to identify promising cuts that accelerate the solution of MILP instances. This paper presents an overview of the topic, highlighting recent advances in the literature, common approaches to data collection, evaluation, and ML model architectures. We analyze the empirical results in the literature in an attempt to quantify the progress that has been made and conclude by suggesting avenues for future research.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们对机器学习技术在混合整数线性规划中选择切割平面（或切割）的最新研究进行了调查。尽管存在各种各样的切割类别，但在分支定界树的给定节点的线性规划放松中选择一组要添加的切割平面的任务迄今为止无法得到正式和启发式解法。机器学习通过使用数据来识别加速解决混合整数线性规划实例的有前景的切割，为改进切割选择过程提供了一种有希望的方法。本文概述了该主题，重点介绍了文献中的最新进展，数据收集、评估和机器学习模型架构的常见方法。我们分析了文献中的实证结果，试图量化已取得的进展，并在最后提出了未来研究的方向。",
