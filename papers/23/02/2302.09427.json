    "abstract": "This paper analyzes a multiplayer war of attrition game with asymmetric type distributions in the setting of private provision of an indivisible public good. In the unique equilibrium, asymmetry leads to a stratified behavior pattern where one agent provides the good instantly with a positive probability, while each of the others has no probability of provision before a certain moment and this moment is idiosyncratic for different agents. Comparative statics show that an agent with less patience, lower cost of provision, and higher reputation in valuation provides the good uniformly faster. The cost of delay is mainly determined by the strongest type of the instant-exit agent. This paper investigates two types of variations of asymmetry: raising the strongest type tends to improve efficiency, whereas controlling the strongest type associates the effect of asymmetry with the sign of an intuitive measure of ``the cost of symmetry\".",

    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了对称类型分布下的多人消耗战博弈，研究了在提供不可分割的公共物品的私人机制中的对称性。在唯一均衡中，不对称性导致了一种分层行为模式，其中一个参与者以一定概率立即提供物品，而其他参与者在某个特定时刻之前没有提供的概率，并且这个时刻对不同的参与者是独特的。比较静态分析表明，耐心度更低、提供成本更低、估值更高的参与者能够更快地提供物品。延迟成本主要由立即退出参与者的最强类型决定。本文还研究了两种不对称性的变化：提升最强类型倾向于提高效率，而控制最强类型与对称性成本的符号相关。",

The patience, cost of provision, and valuation of the players affect the speed of providing the public good. Controlling the strongest type can moderate the effect of asymmetry."
