    "translated_abstract": "Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 (DA-G20)被用作硫酸盐还原细菌（SRB）的模型，SRB与由微生物引起的腐蚀问题有关。SRB基生物膜被认为是导致金属基础设施每年损失数十亿美元的生物腐蚀的原因。了解SRB生物膜中不同生长阶段中细菌细胞的形状和大小属性的提取将有助于设计防腐技术。然而，当前方法存在许多问题，包括耗时的几何特性提取、低效率和高误差率。本文提出了一种名为BiofilmScanner的方法，它是基于Yolact的深度学习方法，并结合了不变矩来解决这些问题。我们的方法可以高效地检测和分割SRB图像中的细菌细胞，同时利用不变矩对分割的细胞的几何特性进行测量，误差较低。所提出方法的数值实验证明了其有效性。",
