    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习和人工智能中, 确定不确定性和鲁棒性是重要的目标。虽然贝叶斯神经网络使得预测中的不确定性能够被评估，不同来源的不确定性是无法区分的。我们提出了不精确的贝叶斯神经网络（IBNNs），它们可以概括和克服标准BNNs的某些缺点。标准BNNs使用单一的先验分布和似然分布进行训练，而IBNNs使用可信区间先验分布和似然分布进行训练。它们允许区分先验和后验不确定性，并对其进行量化。此外，IBNNs在贝叶斯灵敏度分析方面具有鲁棒性，并且对分布变化比标准BNNs更加鲁棒。它们还可以用于计算具有PAC样本复杂性的结果集。我们将IBNNs应用于两个案例研究：一个是为了人工胰腺控制模拟血糖和胰岛素动力学，另一个是运动规划。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new algorithm, Imprecise Bayesian Neural Networks (IBNNs), which can distinguish and quantify the uncertainties in prior and posterior by training with sets of credible prior and likelihood distributions. Compared to standard BNNs, IBNNs are more robust in Bayesian sensitivity analysis and distribution shift. It also presents two case studies in blood glucose and insulin dynamics for artificial pancreas control, and motion planning."
