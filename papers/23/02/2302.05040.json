    "abstract": "Speech-to-text errors made by automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems negatively impact downstream models. Error correction models as a post-processing text editing method have been recently developed for refining the ASR outputs. However, efficient models that meet the low latency requirements of industrial grade production systems have not been well studied. We propose PATCorrect-a novel non-autoregressive (NAR) approach based on multi-modal fusion leveraging representations from both text and phoneme modalities, to reduce word error rate (WER) and perform robustly with varying input transcription quality. We demonstrate that PATCorrect consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAR method on English corpus across different upstream ASR systems, with an overall 11.62% WER reduction (WERR) compared to 9.46% WERR achieved by other methods using text only modality. Besides, its inference latency is at tens of milliseconds, making it ideal for systems with low latency requirements.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动语音识别(ASR)系统产生的语音到文本错误会对下游模型造成负面影响。最近，已经开发了错误修正模型作为后处理文本编辑方法，以优化ASR输出。然而，目前尚未对符合工业级生产系统低延迟需求的高效模型进行充分研究。我们提出了PATCorrect这一新型非自回归(NAR)方法，基于多模态融合，利用文本和音素模态的表示，以降低单词错误率(WER)，并在不同质量的输入转录情况下表现出鲁棒性。我们证明PATCorrect在英语语料上表现优于最先进的NAR方法，与仅使用文本模态的方法相比，总体WER降低了11.62%，而其他方法的WER降低率为9.46%。此外，其推理延迟在毫秒级别，非常适合需要低延迟系统的使用。",
