    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种被称为反事实场景测试(CST)的因果数据挖掘框架来检测分类器中的歧视情况。CST旨在以可操作且有意义的方式回答一种直观问题：“如果个人或投诉人所属的受保护身份不同，模型的结果将会是什么？”它通过反事实推理来对法律基础的情景测试进行扩展，以操作“给定差异的公平原则”的概念。对于任何投诉人，我们在分类器使用的数据集中找到并比较相似的受保护和非受保护实例，构造控制组和测试组，两组的决策结果差异意味着潜在的个人歧视。与情境测试不同，情境测试是围绕投诉人构建两组，我们根据因果知识在投诉人的反事实生成测试组。反事实旨在反映受保护属性对结果的影响。",
    "tldr": "我们提出了一种反事实场景测试框架，通过比较数据集中类似的保护和非保护实例来检测分类器中的歧视，通过比较组间决策结果差异，来发现个人歧视。该框架可以更好地对「给定差异的公平原则」进行操作，以揭示在公平原则下的歧视差异。"
