    "translated_abstract": "在复杂的动态环境中，同时实现四旋翼无人机的准确和可靠的跟踪控制是具有挑战性的。由于来自气动力的阻力和力矩变化是混沌的，并且难以精确识别，大多数现有的四旋翼跟踪系统将其视为传统控制方法中的简单“干扰”。本文提出了一种新颖的、可解释的轨迹跟踪器，将分布式强化学习干扰估计器与随机模型预测控制器（SMPC）相结合，用于未知的气动效应。所提出的估计器“受限分布式强化干扰估计器”（ConsDRED）准确地识别真实气动效应与估计值之间的不确定性。采用简化仿射干扰反馈进行控制参数化，以保证凸性，然后将其与SMPC相结合。我们在理论上保证ConsDRED至少实现最优的全局收敛速率和一定的亚线性收敛速率。",
