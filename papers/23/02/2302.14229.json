    "translated_abstract": "给定一个源语言文本，跨语言摘要（CLS）旨在生成另一种目标语言的摘要。最近，大型语言模型（LLM）的出现，比如GPT-3.5、ChatGPT和GPT-4，引起了计算语言学界的广泛关注。然而，目前尚不清楚LLM在CLS上的表现如何。本文实验性地使用各种提示来指导LLM从不同的范式（即端到端和流水线）执行零样本CLS，并对生成的摘要进行初步评估。我们发现，ChatGPT和GPT-4原本更喜欢生成详细信息的长摘要。但这两个LLM在交互式提示的帮助下可以进一步平衡信息量和简洁性，显著提高它们的CLS性能。在三个广泛使用的CLS数据集上的实验结果表明，GPT-4实现了零样本CLS的最先进性能，并且在性能方面与最佳方法相当。",
