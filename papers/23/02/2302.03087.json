    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在具有二元子模价值的代理人之间公平分配一组不可分割的物品的问题。每个物品都提供$a$或$b$的边际收益（$a<b$），且物品的边际收益递减。这是两种广泛研究的评估类别——二元加性评估和二元子模评估的自然泛化。我们提出了一个简单的顺序算法框架，基于最近介绍的“扬基交换”机制，可以适应计算各种解决方案概念，包括leximin、max Nash welfare（MNW）和当$a$除以$b$时$p$-mean welfare最大化分配。这个结果补充了一个现有的结果，即当$a$不能被$b$整除时，leximin和MNW分配的计算无法复杂化。我们进一步研究了在两个知名属性——无嫉妒和最大最小份额保证方面的leximin和MNW分配。在无嫉妒方面，我们表明leximin和MNW都不满足",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible goods among agents with bivalued submodular valuations and proposes a sequential algorithmic framework for various solution concepts, including leximin, max Nash welfare, and p-mean welfare maximizing allocations. The algorithmic framework supplements existing results by overcoming the limitations in cases where a does not divide b. Furthermore, the paper examines the performance of leximin and MNW allocations in terms of envy-freeness and maximin share guarantee."
