    "translated_abstract": "当前的图形学习算法并不能很好地处理大分子，因为它们没有考虑到原子之间的分层交互，而这对于确定大分子的属性至关重要。在这项工作中，我们提出了多分辨率图形变换器（MGT），这是第一个可以学习表示多种尺度下大分子的图形变换器架构。MGT可以学习产生原子的表示，并将它们分组成有意义的功能组或重复单元。我们还引入了小波位置编码（WavePE），一种新的位置编码方法，可以保证在频谱和空间域中的局部性。我们提出的模型在由聚合物和多肽组成的两个大分子数据集以及一个类似药物的分子数据集上取得了竞争性的结果。重要的是，我们的模型优于其他最先进的方法，在估算分子性质（例如GAP，HOMO和LUMO）时达到了化学精度。",
