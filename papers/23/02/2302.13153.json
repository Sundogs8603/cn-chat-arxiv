    "translated_abstract": "文本引导的扩散模型（如DALLE-2、Imagen和稳定扩散）能够仅通过描述所需图像内容的简短文本提示生成各种形式的图像。在许多情况下，这些图像具有非常高的质量。然而，这些模型通常难以组合包含多个关键对象（如指定位置关系中的字符）的场景。在讲述故事中，能够“直接”指导人物和对象的放置，无论是在图像内还是跨图像内，都是至关重要的，这一点在电影和动画理论的文献中得到了认可。在本文中，我们采用一种特别简单的方法来提供所需的指导。基于一个观察结果，即提示词的交叉注意力映射反映出由这些词所表示的对象的空间布局，我们引入了一个优化目标，在这些交叉注意力映射中的期望位置产生“激活”。由此产生的方法是通向泛化的一步。",
