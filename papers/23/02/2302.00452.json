    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了使用f-散度引导的一类相容风险度量来进行投资组合优化，并导出了在CAPM格式下的必要最佳条件。我们提出了一种新的f-Beta，类似于标准Beta和之前研究中的Drawdown Beta。f-Beta在最优扰动市场概率测度下评估投资组合绩效，并且该Beta度量家族提供了各种程度的灵活性和可解释性。我们采用DOW 30股票对比选择市场投资组合作为最优组合，以展示基于Hellinger-Beta的新视角，以及其与标准Beta和Drawdown Beta的不同之处，基于选择平方Hellinger距离作为f-散度函数的特定选择，衡量f-散度引导的风险度量和f-Betas。我们基于偏差度量计算了Hellinger-Beta度量，并进一步扩展了该方法以计算Hellinger-Betas。",
