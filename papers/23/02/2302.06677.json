A key question is how much this system identification approach tells us about brain computation. Does it validate one model architecture over another? We evaluate the most commonly used comparison techniques, such as a linear encoding model and centered kernel alignment, to correctly identify a model by replacing brain recordings with known ground truth models. System identification performance is quite variable; it also depends significantly on factors independent of the ground truth architecture, such as stimuli images. In addition, we show the limitations of using functional similarity scores in identifying higher-level architectural motifs.",

    "translated_abstract": "人工神经网络被提议作为大脑的部分模型。将这些网络与生物神经元的记录进行比较，并认为在重现神经反应方面的良好性能支持模型的有效性。一个关键问题是，这种系统辨识方法对我们了解脑部计算有多大帮助。它是否能验证某种模型架构优于另一种？我们评估了最常用的比较技术，如线性编码模型和中心核对齐，通过用已知的真实模型替换脑部记录来正确识别模型。系统辨识的性能相当不稳定，它还显著依赖于独立于真实模型架构的因素，如刺激图像。此外，我们展示了使用功能相似性评分在识别更高级别架构图案方面的局限性。",
