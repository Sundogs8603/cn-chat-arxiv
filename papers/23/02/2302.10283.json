While invariant methods are evaluated on large scale datasets, equivariant ones are evaluated in smaller, more controlled, settings. We aim at bridging the gap between the two in order to learn more diverse representations that are suitable for a wide range of tasks. We start by introducing a dataset called 3DIEBench, consisting of renderings from 3D models over 55 classes and more than 2.5 million images where we have full control on the transformations applied to the objects. We further introduce a predictor architecture based on hypernetworks to learn equivariant representations with no possible collapse to invariance. We introduce SIE (Split Invariant-Equivariant) which combines the hypernetwork-based predictor with representations split in two parts, one invariant, the other equivariant, to learn richer representations. We demonstrate significant performance gains",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，自监督学习在学习不变或等变表示方面取得了进展。尽管不变方法在大规模数据集上进行评估，但等变方法在更小、更可控的环境中进行评估。我们旨在弥合两者之间的差距，以便学习更加多样化、适用于广泛任务的表示方法。我们首先介绍一个称为3DIEBench的数据集，包括来自55个类别的3D模型渲染图像超过250万张，我们可以完全控制应用于对象的变换。我们还引入了一种基于超网络的预测器体系结构，以学习等变表示，从而不可能出现不变性崩塌的情况。我们介绍了SIE（分裂不变-等变）的概念，它将基于超网络的预测器与分裂为两部分（一部分为不变形，另一部分为等变形）的表示相结合，以学习更丰富的表示。我们证明了显著的性能提高。",
