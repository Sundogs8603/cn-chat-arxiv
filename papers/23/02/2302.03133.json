    "translated_abstract": "无监督领域自适应（UDA）可以将源域训练的模型转移到未标记的目标域。然而，转移复杂的时间序列模型面临着挑战，因为不同域中存在动态的时间结构变化，导致时间和频率表示中的特征偏移。此外，源域和目标域中的任务标签分布可能存在显著差异，难以解决标签偏移和识别唯一于目标域的标签。有效地转移复杂的时间序列模型仍然是一个十分困难的问题。本文提出了Raincoat，这是第一个针对复杂时间序列的封闭集和通用领域自适应模型。Raincoat通过考虑时间和频率特征，跨域对齐它们，修正不匹配以便于检测私有标签来解决特征和标签偏移问题。此外，Raincoat通过识别源域和目标域之间的共享结构来提高可传递性。",
