Analyzing the entire firm-level production network of a European economy, we explore how the worst outcomes of such approaches can be avoided. We compare the systemic relevance of every firm with its annual CO2 emissions to identify optimal emission-reducing strategies with a minimum of additional unemployment and economic losses. Setting specific reduction targets we study various decarbonization scenarios and quantify their economic consequences. We show that for an emission-reduction of 20% the most effective strategy leads to losses of about 2% of jobs and 2% of economic output. In contrast, a naive scenario targeting largest emitters first, results in 28% job losses and 33% output reduction for the same target. This demonstrates that it is possible to use firm-level produ",

    "translated_abstract": "急需减少碳排放可能导致严格的命令与控制脱碳策略，可能带来负面经济后果。本文分析了欧洲经济的整体企业级生产网络，探讨了如何避免这些方法的最坏结果。我们比较了每家公司的系统重要性和其年二氧化碳排放量，以确定具有最小额外失业和经济损失的最佳减排策略。我们设定了特定的减排目标，研究了各种脱碳情景并量化了它们的经济后果。我们表明，对于减排20％，最有效的策略导致约2％的就业岗位损失和2％的经济产出损失。相比之下，针对最大排放企业的朴素情景，相同目标会导致28％的失业率和33％的产出减少。这表明可以使用企业级生产方式来实现脱碳目标，而不会带来过度的经济损失和失业。",
