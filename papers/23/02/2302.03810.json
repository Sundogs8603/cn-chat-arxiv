As our key contribution, we carefully axiomatize a notion of individual fairness in the two-sided marketplace setting which respects the uncertainty in the merits; indeed, it simultaneously recognizes uncertainty as the primary potential cause of unfairness and an approach to address it.

    "translated_abstract": "算法在将学生分配到学校、用户分配给广告商以及应聘者安排工作面试时被使用，如今这种算法两边的市场普及程度越来越高，这也引起了人们对市场公平性问题的关注。在这种情境下，匹配的决策应该尊重被匹配个体的偏好，同时也需要在保证公平性的前提下考虑个体的品质以及未来表现。由于这些品质往往是通过机器学习算法从可观察特征中推断出来的，所以其判定是不确定的。本文的主要贡献是，在两边市场的框架下，我们对个体公平性的概念进行了严谨的公理化阐述，从而考虑到了这种不确定性对公平性的潜在影响，也在推断过程中尝试解决了这些影响。同时，我们还设计了一个线性规划模型，来实现对分配的公平性和效用最大化的均衡。",
