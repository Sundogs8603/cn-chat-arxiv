    "translated_abstract": "多模态学习对于从磁共振成像数据中自动进行脑肿瘤分割十分关键。明确优化所有模态间共享的共同信息（例如通过最大化总相关性），已经被证明可以实现更好的特征表示，从而提高分割性能。然而，现有方法对于子集间共享的部分共同信息却无视。本文中，我们展示了识别这种部分共同信息能够显著增强图像分割模型的判别能力。具体而言，我们引入了部分共同信息掩码（PCI-mask）的新概念，以细粒度地描述哪些模态子集之间共享了部分共同信息。通过解决一个掩码相关性最大化问题，并同时学习一个最优的PCI-mask，我们识别出了部分共同信息的潜在微结构，并在脑肿瘤分割中利用它。",
