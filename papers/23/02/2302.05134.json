    "translated_abstract": "最近的深度聚类研究发现了一些有前途的方法用于约束聚类问题。它们通常可以使用成对约束来指导数据的分组。然而，许多问题具有聚类级别的约束，例如容量约束聚类问题（CCP），其中每个点具有权重，每个簇中所有点的权重总和由规定的容量限制。本文提出了一种新的CCP方法“神经容量聚类”，该方法学习一个神经网络来预测数据点分配到簇中心的概率，该神经网络以其他问题实例的最优或近似最优解的数据集为基础。在推理过程中，使用得分在容量约束下迭代地类似于K均值的过程来改进分配。在人造数据和两个真实数据集上的实验中，我们的方法优于文献中的多个最先进的数学和启发式求解器。",
