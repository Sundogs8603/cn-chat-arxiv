    "translated_abstract": "随着深度神经网络在安全关键应用中的部署越来越多，校准深度学习模型以获得具有不确定性意识的预测变得至关重要。尽管现有的事后校准方法在领域内的测试数据集上取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但它们在领域转移和领域外（OOD）情景下无法产生可靠的不确定性估计。我们旨在通过提出基于k近邻的DAC（Density-Aware Calibration）方法来弥补这个差距。与现有的事后方法不同，我们利用分类器的隐藏层作为与不确定性相关信息的来源，并研究它们的重要性。我们表明DAC是一个通用的方法，可以方便地与最先进的事后方法结合使用。DAC提高了在领域转移和OOD情景下校准性能的稳健性，同时保持了出色的领域内预测不确定性估计。我们证明了DAC能够一直引导着一致",
