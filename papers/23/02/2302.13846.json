The field of domain adaptation proposes techniques for a situation where label data for the target population does not exist, but some information about the target distribution does exist. In this paper we contribute to the domain adaptation literature by introducing domain-adaptive decision trees (DADT). We focus on decision trees given their growing popularity due to their interpretability and performance relative to other more complex models. With DADT we aim to improve the accuracy",

    "translated_abstract": "在使用预先训练的机器学习模型时，已知一个问题是该模型所部署的目标人群可能与训练模型时使用的源人群并不相同。这可能导致模型的偏见，降低模型的性能。风险之一是，随着人群的变化，某些人群将被该模型低估，或者在目标人群中受到不利影响，即使他们在目标人群中变得更具代表性。领域适应提出了一些技术，用于解决目标人群不存在标签数据，但某些有关目标分布的信息存在的情况。本文通过引入领域适应的决策树(DADT)，为领域适应文献做出贡献。鉴于决策树因其可解释性和相对于其他更复杂模型的性能而越来越受到欢迎，我们将重点放在决策树上。通过DADT，我们旨在提高模型精确度。",
