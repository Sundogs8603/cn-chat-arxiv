    "translated_abstract": "人工智能方法在提高对大型天文数据集的处理质量和速度方面显示出极大的潜力，但这些方法的高复杂性导致提取数据集特定、不具鲁棒性的特征。因此，这些方法不能很好地推广到多个数据集。我们提出了一种通用域自适应方法，称为 DeepAstroUDA，作为克服这一挑战的途径。这个算法执行半监督域适应，并可以应用于具有不同数据分布和类别重叠的数据集。非重叠类可以存在于两个数据集中的任何一个（有标签的源域或无标签的目标域），而且即使存在未知类别，该方法也可以使用。我们将我们的方法应用于三个不同复杂度（$3$类和$10$类问题）的银河形态分类任务的例子，包括异常检测: 1）来自勘测望远镜不同观测年数的数据集，2）带有非标准滤镜的深度勘测，以及3）不同退化级别的模拟数据。我们的实验表明，DeepAstroUDA在分类精度方面提供了显著的改善，特别是在标记数据稀缺或不可用的情况下。我们的方法可以用于促进更灵活和高效的天文分类系统的创建，并可以提高天文图像中异常检测的质量。",
