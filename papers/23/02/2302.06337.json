We introduce Logic-guided Learning from Noisy Crowd Labels (Logic-LNCL), an EM-alike iterative logic knowledge distillation framework that learns from both noisy labeled data and logic rules of interest. Unlike traditional EM methods, our framework contains a ``pseudo-E-step'' that distills from the logic rules a new type of learning target, which is then used in the ``pseudo-M-step'' for training the classifier. Extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets for text sentiment classification and named entity recognition demonstrate that the proposed framework improves the state-of-the-art and provides a new solution to learning from noisy crowd labels.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了将符号逻辑知识集成到深度神经网络中，从嘈杂的众包标签中学习的方法。我们引入了一种逻辑引导的从嘈杂的众包标签中学习的框架（Logic-LNCL），这是一种类似EM的迭代逻辑知识蒸馏框架，能够从嘈杂的标记数据和感兴趣的逻辑规则中进行学习。与传统的EM方法不同，我们的框架包含一种“伪E步骤”，从逻辑规则中蒸馏出一种新类型的学习目标，然后在“伪M步骤”中使用该目标来训练分类器。在文本情感分类和命名实体识别的两个真实世界数据集上进行的广泛评估表明，所提出的框架改进了最先进技术并为从嘈杂的众包标签中学习提供了一种新的解决方案。",
