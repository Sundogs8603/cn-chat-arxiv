    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19大流行对全球健康造成了巨大的破坏。尽管三年过去了，世界仍在与这种病毒斗争。人们越来越关注COVID-19对感染者心理健康的影响，他们更容易患上抑郁症，这会对受影响的个体和世界产生长期后果。在COVID-19患者中早期检测和干预可以降低患抑郁症的风险。本文通过社交媒体分析探讨了COVID-19感染和抑郁症之间的关系。首先，我们管理了一个包含COVID-19患者社交媒体活动信息的数据集。其次，我们对这个数据集进行了广泛的分析，以研究COVID-19感染风险较高的患者的特点。第三，我们提出了一个深度神经网络，用于早期预测抑郁症风险。",
