    "translated_abstract": "智慧城市运行在计算预测框架上，收集、整合和利用大规模传感器网络的数据。然而，这些框架容易受到多种数据和算法偏见的影响，这经常导致不公正的预测结果。本文首先通过研究田纳西州查塔努加的真实城市数据，展示了偏见在微观层面上在时间和空间上仍然存在。为了缓解这种偏见问题，我们引入了Fairguard，这是一种基于微观层面时间逻辑的方法，用于在复杂的时间空间域中进行公正的智慧城市政策调整和生成。Fairguard框架由两个阶段组成：首先，我们开发了一个静态生成器，能够通过最小化所选属性之间的相关性，基于时间逻辑条件来减少数据偏见。然后，为了确保预测算法的公正性，我们设计了一个动态组件来调节预测结果，并利用逻辑规则生成未来的公正预测。",
