    "translated_abstract": "在许多工业应用中，获得标记的观测数据并不简单，通常需要人工专家干预或使用昂贵的测试设备。在这种情况下，主动学习可以大大提高拟合模型时最信息数据点的建议。减少模型开发所需的观测数据数量可以减轻训练所需的计算负担和标记相关的操作支出。特别是在线主动学习，在需要在极短时间内决定是否获取数据点标记的高容量生产过程中非常有用。然而，尽管最近致力于开发在线主动学习策略，但在存在异常值的情况下这些方法的行为仍未得到彻底研究。在这项工作中，我们调查了在线主动线性回归在受污染的数据流中的性能，并提出了一种自适应方法，用于鲁棒的在线主动学习，同时保证稳定性并减少异常值的负面影响。",
