    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个简单的方法来逼近基于离散化曲线连接彼此的正态分布和逼近这些曲线上相邻正态分布之间的Rao距离，该方法基于Jeffreys离散度的平方根，即对称化的Kullback-Leibler离散度。我们实验考虑了普通、自然和期望参数化的正态分布的线性插值曲线，并将这些曲线与源自Calvo 和Oller将Fisher-Rao $d$-variate正常流形等距嵌入$(d+1)\\times (d+1)$对称正定矩阵锥体的一条曲线进行比较。我们报告了我们的实验结果，并通过将数值逼近与上限和下限进行比较来评估我们逼近技术的质量。最后，我们介绍了Calvo和Oller的一些信息几何性质。",
