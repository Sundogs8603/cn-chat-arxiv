    "translated_abstract": "工业组件的数字化以及本地网络之间的互连性增加了网络攻击的风险。设计一个确保工业生态系统安全的入侵检测系统很困难，因为网络流量包含各种攻击类型，包括细微变化的新型和进化型攻击。用于构建计算机网络预测模型的数据具有偏斜的类分布和有限的攻击类型表示，这与真实的网络流量不同。这些限制导致了数据集漂移，负面影响机器学习模型的预测能力，并降低了对新型攻击的检测率。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的基于深度神经网络的元学习框架；INformation FUsion and Stacking Ensemble (INFUSE)用于网络入侵检测。首先，通过整合决策空间和特征空间创建混合特征空间。然后，使用五个不同的分类器对数据进行分类和预测。",
