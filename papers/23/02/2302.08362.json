    "translated_abstract": "传统的文本风格转移方法侧重于句子级的风格转移，而没有考虑上下文信息，并且风格是通过属性（例如，正式程度）来描述的。当将风格转移应用于任务导向对话等对话时，现有的方法受到这些限制的影响，因为上下文可以起到重要作用，而对话中的风格属性往往很难定义。在本文中，我们将对话风格转移引入为一个少样本学习问题，模型通过观察目标风格中的少量示例对话来进行风格转移。我们提出了一种新的上下文学习方法来解决这个任务，将不带风格的对话作为中转。人工评估结果显示，通过结合多轮对话上下文，该模型能够匹配目标风格，同时与语句/句子级风格转移相比，具有更好的恰当性和语义正确性。此外，我们还展示了对话风格转移技术的应用效果。",
