However, it has been limited to either simple optical systems consisting of a single element such as a diffractive optical element (DOE) or metalens, or the fine-tuning of compound lenses from good initial designs. Here we present a DeepLens design method based on curriculum learning, which is able to learn optical designs of compound lenses ab initio from randomly initialized surfaces without human intervention, therefore overcoming the need for a good initial design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by fully automatically designing both classical imaging lenses and a large field-of-view extended depth-of-field computational lens in a cellphone-style form factor, with highly aspheric surfaces and a short back focal length.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度光学优化最近被提出作为使用输出图像作为目标的计算成像系统设计的新范式。然而，它目前被限制于单个元素（如衍射光学元件（DOE）或金属透镜）构成的简单光学系统，或者从良好的初始设计微调复合透镜。在这里，我们提出了一种基于Curriculum Learning的DeepLens设计方法，能够从随机初始化表面从头开始学习复合透镜的光学设计，而无需人为干预，因此克服了对良好初始设计的需求。我们通过完全自动设计经典成像透镜和一个类似手机风格的大视场延伸景深计算透镜，验证了我们方法的有效性，具有高度非球面曲面和短后焦距。",
