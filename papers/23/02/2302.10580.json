    "abstract": "We present Classy Ensemble, a novel ensemble-generation algorithm for classification tasks, which aggregates models through a weighted combination of per-class accuracy. Tested over 153 machine learning datasets we demonstrate that Classy Ensemble outperforms two other well-known aggregation algorithms -order-based pruning and clustering-based pruning -- as well as the recently introduced lexigarden ensemble generator. We then present three enhancements: 1) Classy Cluster Ensemble, which combines Classy Ensemble and cluster-based pruning; 2) Deep Learning experiments, showing the merits of Classy Ensemble over four image datasets: Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet; and 3) Classy Evolutionary Ensemble, wherein an evolutionary algorithm is used to select the set of models which Classy Ensemble picks from.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了Classy Ensemble，一种新的用于分类任务的集成算法，它通过每类准确率的加权组合来聚合模型。我们在153个机器学习数据集上进行了测试，结果表明，Classy Ensemble优于两种其他著名的聚合算法——基于顺序的修剪和基于聚类的修剪——以及最近引入的lexigarden集成生成器。接着，我们提出了三种增强方法：1）Classy Cluster Ensemble，将Classy Ensemble和基于聚类的修剪相结合；2）深度学习实验，展示了Classy Ensemble在四个图像数据集Fashion MNIST、CIFAR10、CIFAR100和ImageNet上的优越性；以及3）Classy Evolutionary Ensemble，其中使用进化算法来选择Classy Ensemble从中选择的模型集合。",
