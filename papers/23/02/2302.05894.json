    "translated_abstract": "阿尔茨海默病（AD）影响一个人的记忆、思维和语言能力，严重损害个体的生活。早期诊断非常重要，因为它可以使人们及时得到医疗帮助并确保生活质量。因此，利用自发言语和机器学习方法来识别AD患者已成为一个热门话题。大多数以前的工作使用卷积神经网络（CNN）处理输入信号。然而，寻找CNN结构是一个耗时的过程，需要领域专业知识。此外，研究人员介绍了早期和后期融合方法，用于融合不同的模态或者在训练期间连接不同模态的表示，因此不能捕捉模态间的交互作用。为了解决这些限制，首先我们利用神经结构搜索（NAS）方法自动发现高效的CNN结构。接下来，我们利用几种融合方法，包括多模态分解。",
