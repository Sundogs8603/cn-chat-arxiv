    "translated_abstract": "在极端工作条件下运行的高效能转换工厂的安全性高度依赖于准确且可解释的自动监测系统。然而，目前可用的数据驱动监测系统在高准确性或可解释性方面往往无法满足要求，从而阻碍了它们在实践中的应用。为了克服这一限制，提出了一种基于广义消息传递框架的数据驱动方法——AttentionMixer，旨在为能量变换厂建立一个准确且可解释的辐射监测框架。为了提高模型的准确性，第一项技术贡献包括开发空间和时间自适应消息传递块，分别用于捕获空间和时间相关性；这两个块通过混合算子级联。为了增强模型可解释性，第二项技术贡献涉及实现注意力和可视化技术，使得可以对模型的预测做出解释。",
