    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型的规模不断扩大，所需的计算资源也随之增加。脉冲神经网络（SNN）已成为一种能够利用稀疏和事件驱动激活减少模型推理计算开销的节能深度学习方法。虽然它们在许多计算机视觉任务上已经具有竞争力，但SNN的训练也被证明更具挑战性。因此，它们的性能落后于现代深度学习，我们尚未看到SNN在语言生成方面的有效性。在本文中，我们受到Receptance Weighted Key Value（RWKV）语言模型的启发，成功实现了“SpikeGPT”，它是一种具有二进制、事件驱动脉冲激活单元的生成语言模型。我们在两种模型变体上训练了所提出的模型：45M和216M参数。据我们所知，SpikeGPT是迄今最大的反向传播训练SNN模型，使其适用于非脉冲模型通常解决的大规模语言生成任务。",
