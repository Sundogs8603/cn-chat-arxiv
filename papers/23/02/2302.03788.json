    "translated_abstract": "Neural Language Models of Code，或者称为神经代码模型（NCMs），正在迅速从研究原型发展为商业开发者工具。因此，理解这些模型的能力和局限性变得至关重要。然而，这些模型的能力通常是使用自动化指标来衡量的，这些指标通常只能揭示它们真实性能的一部分。一般来说，NCMs的性能似乎很有前途，但目前关于这些模型如何做出决策仍有很多未知。因此，本文介绍了一种名为$do_{code}$的后验解释方法，该方法专门针对NCMs，能够解释模型的预测。$do_{code}$基于因果推断，以实现面向编程语言的解释。虽然$do_{code}$的理论基础可扩展到探索不同的模型属性，但我们提供了一个具体的实例，旨在减少影响...",
