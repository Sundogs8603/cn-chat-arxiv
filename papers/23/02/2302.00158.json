    "abstract": "Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) is an effective way to alleviate the cold-start problem. However, previous work severely ignores fairness and bias when learning the mapping function, which is used to obtain the representations for fresh users in the target domain. To study this problem, in this paper, we propose a Fairness-aware Cross-Domain Recommendation model, called FairCDR. Our method achieves user-oriented group fairness by learning the fairness-aware mapping function. Since the overlapping data are quite limited and distributionally biased, FairCDR leverages abundant non-overlapping users and interactions to help alleviate these problems. Considering that each individual has different influence on model fairness, we propose a new reweighing method based on Influence Function (IF) to reduce unfairness while maintaining recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",

    "translated_abstract": "跨领域推荐是缓解冷启动问题的有效方法，但以往的方法在学习映射函数时严重忽视了公平性和偏见，这会影响到目标领域中新用户的表示。为了研究这个问题，本文提出了一种名为FairCDR的公平感知跨领域推荐模型。我们的方法通过学习公平感知的映射函数实现了面向用户群体的公平性。由于重叠数据相当有限且具有分布偏差，我们利用丰富的非重叠用户和交互来帮助缓解这些问题。考虑到每个个体对模型公平性具有不同的影响，我们提出了一种基于影响函数的新的重新加权方法，以减少不公平性同时保持推荐准确性。我们进行了广泛的实验来证明我们模型的有效性。",
