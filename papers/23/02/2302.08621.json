    "translated_abstract": "（有向）带节点属性的图是各种应用中常见的一种数据类型，关于开发用于比较它们的度量标准和高效算法有大量文献。最近，在图学习和优化领域，针对带节点属性的图比较已经出现了一系列新方法，利用了最优输运（OT）和Weisfeiler-Lehman（WL）图同构测试等思想。两个最先进的代表是(O'Connor等人，2022)提出的OTC距离和(Chen等人，2022)提出的WL距离。有趣的是，尽管这两种距离基于不同的思想开发，我们观察到它们都将图视为马尔可夫链，并且有着深刻的联系。实际上，在本文中，我们提出了一个统一框架来生成马尔可夫链的距离（从而包括带节点属性的（有向）图），我们称之为最优输运马尔可夫（OTM）d",
