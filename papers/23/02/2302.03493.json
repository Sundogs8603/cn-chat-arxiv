    "translated_abstract": "条件t-SNE（ct-SNE）是t-SNE的最新扩展，它允许从嵌入中删除已知的聚类信息，以获得揭示标签信息之外的结构的可视化结果。这在需要消除一组类之间不想要的差异时非常有用。我们发现在许多现实情况下，ct-SNE的表现并不理想，尤其是当数据在原始的高维空间中按标签进行良好的聚类时。我们提出了一种改进的方法，通过对高维相似度进行条件限制，并将基于标签的最近邻和跨标签的最近邻存储在不同的矩阵中。这还使得我们能够使用最近提出的t-SNE加速技术，提高算法的可扩展性。从合成数据的实验中，我们发现我们提出的方法解决了考虑的问题，并改善了嵌入质量。但是在包含批次效应的实际数据中，预期的改进并不总是存在。我们认为经过修订的ct-SNE较原始的算法更优。",
