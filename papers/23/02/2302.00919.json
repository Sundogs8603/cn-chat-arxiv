    "translated_abstract": "在实际的压缩感知过程中，获得的测量数据通常需要在传输或存储前限制为有限比特的量化。这个非线性量化过程带来了重大的恢复挑战，特别是在极度粗糙的量化如1比特下。最近，提出了一种称为QCS-SGM的有效算法，该算法利用基于得分的生成模型(SGM)作为隐式先验进行量化压缩感知(QCS)。由于SGM在捕捉自然信号的复杂结构方面的熟练程度，QCS-SGM明显优于以前的QCS方法。然而，QCS-SGM局限于(近似)行正交传感矩阵，否则可能会无法计算似然分数。为了解决这个限制，我们引入了QCS-SGM+的高级变体，可以有效地处理一般矩阵。关键思想是似然分数计算的贝叶斯推理观点，其中计算期望得分以解决每个测量的结构非正交情况。",
