    "translated_abstract": "背景：基质辅助激光解吸/电离质谱成像（MALDI MSI）在癌症研究中显示出重要的潜力，特别是在肿瘤分型和亚型分析中。肺癌是肿瘤相关死亡的主要原因，其中最致命的实体是腺癌（ADC）和鳞状细胞癌（SqCC）。区分这两种常见亚型对于治疗决策和患者管理至关重要。结果：我们提出了一个新的代数拓扑框架，通过从MALDI数据中获取内在信息并将其转化为反映拓扑持久性的形式。我们的框架具有两个主要优点。首先，拓扑持久性有助于区分信号和噪音。其次，它压缩了MALDI数据，节省了存储空间，并优化了后续分类任务的计算时间。我们提供了一种高效实现我们拓扑框架的算法，该算法依赖于单一调优参数。",
