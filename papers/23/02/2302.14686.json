    "translated_abstract": "带有背包的掠夺者问题（BwK）是在全局预算约束下将掠夺者问题进行泛化的研究，近年来引起了广泛关注。之前的研究关注的是两个极端之一：随机BwK，在每一轮中，奖励和资源的消耗从一个独立同分布的分布中采样；而敌对BwK，则由对手选择这些参数。这两种情况下的可实现保证存在巨大的差距：在随机情况下可以达到无悔学习，而在敌对情况下只能达到基于竞争比的保证，其中竞争比取决于预算或同时取决于时间和资源数量。这种差距之所以如此巨大，在敌对BwK的典型情况下，保证性能变得更差时，预算更加紧缺。虽然已知存在“两全其美”类型的算法（单个算法可以在两个极端情况下提供最佳的可实现保证），它们的界限则会变差。",
