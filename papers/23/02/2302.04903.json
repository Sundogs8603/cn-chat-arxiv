    "translated_abstract": "仿真参数设置（如接触模型和物体几何近似）对于训练能够从仿真转换到真实环境部署的稳健机器人策略至关重要。以往的方法通常手工制作参数分布（域随机化），或者识别最能匹配真实环境动力学的参数（系统识别）。然而，仿真与现实之间往往存在着无法消除的差距：试图在所有状态和任务下匹配仿真和现实的动力学可能是不可行的，也不一定能够在特定任务的现实环境中表现良好。针对这个问题，我们提出了AdaptSim，这是一个新的任务驱动的适应性框架，用于模拟到实际转换，其目标是优化目标（真实）环境中的任务性能，而不是匹配仿真和现实之间的动力学。首先，我们使用强化学习在仿真中元学习一个适应策略。",
