    "abstract": "Learning visual representations with interpretable features, i.e., disentangled representations, remains a challenging problem. Existing methods demonstrate some success but are hard to apply to large-scale vision datasets like ImageNet. In this work, we propose a simple post-processing framework to disentangle content and style in learned representations from pre-trained vision models. We model the pre-trained features probabilistically as linearly entangled combinations of the latent content and style factors and develop a simple disentanglement algorithm based on the probabilistic model. We show that the method provably disentangles content and style features and verify its efficacy empirically. Our post-processed features yield significant domain generalization performance improvements when the distribution shift occurs due to style changes or style-related spurious correlations.",

    "translated_abstract": "学习具有可解释特征的视觉表征，即分离的表征，仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。现有方法在某些情况下表现出成功，但要应用于像ImageNet这样的大规模视觉数据集则很困难。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个简单的后处理框架，用于从预训练的视觉模型中分离学习到的表征中的内容和风格。我们将预训练特征概率地建模为潜在内容和风格因素的线性综合，并基于概率模型开发了一个简单的分离算法。我们证明了该方法能够可靠地分离内容和风格特征，并在实践中验证了其有效性。我们处理后的特征在样式变化或与样式相关的虚假相关性导致分布偏移时，可以显著提高领域泛化性能。",
