    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了InstructABSA，一种使用指令学习范式进行Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) 所有子任务（Aspect Term Extraction (ATE)，Aspect Term Sentiment Classification (ATSC)，以及Joint Task modeling）的方法。我们的方法对每个训练样本引入了正面、负面、和中性的例子，并使用指令来调整每个ABSA子任务的模型（Tk-Instruct），从而显著提高了性能。在Sem Eval 2014、2015和2016数据集上的实验结果表明，在所有三个ABSA子任务（ATE、ATSC和Joint Task）上，InstructABSA在性能上都比之前的最先进方法（SOTA）表现出了显著的优势，并且表现超过了7倍大的模型。特别是，在Rest14 ATE子任务上，InstructABSA超过了SOTA 7.31%的得分，Rest15 ATSC子任务上也有提升，并且在Lapt14 Joint Task上的表现提升了8.63%点。我们的结果还表明，对于所有三个子任务，InstructABSA具有强大的新领域泛化能力。",
