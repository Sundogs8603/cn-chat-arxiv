    "abstract": "Large Language Models have vastly grown in capabilities. One proposed application of such AI systems is to support data collection in the social and cognitive sciences, where perfect experimental control is currently unfeasible and the collection of large, representative datasets is generally expensive. In this paper, we re-replicate 14 studies from the Many Labs 2 replication project with OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model, colloquially known as GPT3.5. We collected responses from the default setting of GPT3.5 by inputting each study's survey as text. Among the eight studies we could analyse, our GPT sample replicated 37.5% of the original results as well as 37.5% of the Many Labs 2 results. Unexpectedly, we could not analyse the remaining six studies as we had planned in our pre-registration. This was because for each of these six studies, GPT3.5 answered at least one of the survey questions (either a dependent variable or a condition variable) in an extremely predetermined way: an unex",
