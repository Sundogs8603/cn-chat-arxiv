Recent studies have made significant progress in representing scenes using object slots. In this work, we introduce Reusable Slotwise Mechanisms, or RSM, a framework that models object dynamics by leveraging communication among slots along with a modular architecture capable of dynamically selecting reusable mechanisms for predicting the future states of each object slot. Crucially, RSM leverages the Central Contextual Information (CCI), enabling selected mechanisms to access the remaining slots through a bottleneck, effectively allowing for modeling of higher order and complex interactions that might require a sparse subset of objects.

    "translated_abstract": "具有理解和推理对象动态的能力的代理人在新场景中表现出更好的鲁棒性和泛化性。然而，实现这种能力不仅需要有效的场景表示，还需要对对象子集之间相互作用机制的理解。最近的研究在使用对象槽表示场景方面取得了重大进展。在这项工作中，我们引入了可重复使用的逐槽机制（RSM），这是一个框架，通过在槽之间进行通信以及具有动态选择可重复使用机制的模块化架构，来模拟对象动态学。关键是，RSM利用了中央上下文信息（CCI），使得选择的机制能够通过一个瓶颈来访问其余的槽，从而有效地建模可能需要稀疏对象子集的高阶和复杂的相互作用。实验表明，RSM能够在不同任务中有效地学习对象动态学，展现出了优越的性能。",
