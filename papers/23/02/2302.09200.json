    "translated_abstract": "在医学影像领域利用深度神经网络的能力存在挑战，主要是由于获取大规模标注数据集的困难，特别是对于罕见疾病来说，注释需求的成本、时间和工作量很高。无监督疾病检测方法，如异常检测，可以大大减少这些场景下的人力投入。虽然异常检测通常是专注于仅从健康受试者的图像中进行学习，但现实情况下常常存在包含同时健康和患病受试者的未标注数据集。最近的研究表明，利用这些未标注的图像可以改善无监督疾病和异常检测。然而，这些方法并未利用特定于脑图像的知识，从而在神经疾病检测方面表现不佳。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了Brainomaly，一种专门用于神经疾病检测的基于GAN的图像翻译方法。",
