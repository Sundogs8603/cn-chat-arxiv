    "translated_abstract": "解决图学习模型中的不公平性是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为图中的不公平问题涉及属性和拓扑结构。现有的公平图学习工作假设训练模型时所有节点的属性都是可用的，然后进行公平预测。然而，在实践中，由于数据缺失或隐私问题，一些节点的属性可能无法访问，这使得公平图学习更加具有挑战性。本文提出了一种公平属性补全方法FairAC，用于补全缺失信息并学习具有公平性的图节点嵌入。FairAC采用注意机制处理属性缺失问题，并减轻属性和补全导致的两种不公平性，即属性不公平和拓扑不公平。FairAC可以适应不同类型的同质图并为它们生成公平的嵌入，因此可以应用于大多数图数据场景。",
