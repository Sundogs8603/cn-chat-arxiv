    "abstract": "The European Union has proposed the Artificial Intelligence Act which introduces a proportional risk-based approach to AI regulation including detailed requirements for transparency and explainability. Many of these requirements may be addressed in practice by the field of explainable AI (XAI), however, there are fundamental differences between XAI and the Act regarding what transparency and explainability are. These basic definitions should be aligned to assure that regulation continually translates into appropriate technical practices. To facilitate this alignment, we first give an overview of how XAI and European regulation view basic definitions of transparency with a particular focus on the AI Act and the related General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

    "translated_abstract": "欧盟提出了《人工智能法案》，引入了基于风险的比例方法来规范人工智能，其中详细要求透明度和可解释性。虽然可解释AI（XAI）领域可以解决这些要求中的许多问题，但在透明度和可解释性的具体定义上，XAI与该法案存在基本差异。为了实现这种对齐，我们首先概述了XAI和欧洲法规是如何看待透明度的基本定义的，特别是AI法案和相关的通用数据保护条例（GDPR）。然后我们进行了比较，旨在确定改善领域之间对齐的主要要点：澄清透明度的范围，XAI的法律地位，监管问题。",
