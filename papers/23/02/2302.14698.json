    "translated_abstract": "社区检测是计算科学中的一项基本问题，在各个领域都有广泛应用。最常用的方法是设计算法来在网络节点的不同划分之间最大化模块化。通过使用来自各种背景的80个真实和随机网络，我们调查了当前启发式模块化最大化算法在返回最大模块化（最优）划分方面的成功程度。我们评估了（1）算法输出模块化与每个输入图的最大模块化之比，以及（2）它们的输出划分与该图的任何最优划分之间的最大相似度。我们将八种现有的启发式算法与全局最大化模块化的精确整数规划方法进行比较。平均基于模块化的启发式算法只为考虑的80个图的16.9%返回最优划分。此外，根据调整后的互信息的结果显示出实质性差异。",
