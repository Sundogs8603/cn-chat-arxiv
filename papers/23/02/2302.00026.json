    "translated_abstract": "超新星在星系形成和演化中起着重要作用。在使用大规模并行计算进行高分辨率星系模拟时，超新星的短积分时间步长成为严重瓶颈。为了解决这个问题，一种可能的解决方案是使用Hamiltonian分裂方法，即将需要短积分时间步长的区域与整个系统分开积分。为了将这种方法应用于平滑粒子流体动力学模拟中受超新星影响的粒子，我们需要在随后的全局步骤中提前检测到这些粒子所在的壳层的形状。本文中，我们开发了一个名为3D-MIM的深度学习模型来预测超新星爆炸后的壳层扩张。通过对带有粒子质量$m_{\\rm gas}$ = 1 M$_\\odot$的湍流云模拟进行训练，该模型能够准确地再现出各向异性的壳层形状，其中密度逐渐下降。",
