    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一种非标准的随机控制问题，其灵感来源于带有非递减基准过程的最优消费与财富跟踪。具体而言，单调基准是通过漂移布朗运动的运行最大值来建模的。我们考虑使用资本注入的松弛跟踪公式，使得注入的资本所补偿的财富在任何时候都优于基准过程。随机控制问题是在动态底部约束下，最大化削减资本注入成本后的消费的期望效用。通过引入两个带反射的辅助状态过程，我们制定了一个等效的辅助控制问题，同时研究了杠杆资本注入和底部约束控制，使其隐匿起来。为了解决带有两个Neumann边界条件的HJB方程，我们使用一些新颖的概率技巧建立了对偶PDE的唯一经典解分离形式的存在性。我们的主要贡献是确定了对偶价值函数的一些关键性质，从而使我们能够建立松弛财富跟踪问题的最优解的存在性和唯一性，并得出了一些有趣的经济影响。",
