    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the leading paradigm for learning on (static) graph-structured data. However, many real-world systems are dynamic in nature, since the graph and node/edge attributes change over time. In recent years, GNN-based models for temporal graphs have emerged as a promising area of research to extend the capabilities of GNNs. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art of temporal GNN, introducing a rigorous formalization of learning settings and tasks and a novel taxonomy categorizing existing approaches in terms of how the temporal aspect is represented and processed. We conclude the survey with a discussion of the most relevant open challenges for the field, from both research and application perspectives.",

    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）已经成为学习（静态）图结构数据的主要范例。然而，许多真实世界的系统是动态的，因为图和节点/边属性随着时间而变化。近年来，基于GNN的时态图模型已经成为扩展GNN能力的有前途的研究领域。在这项工作中，我们提供了第一个关于时态GNN的现状全面的概述，引入了学习设置和任务的严格规范化以及一个新的分类法，以表示和处理时态方面的现有方法。我们从研究和应用角度讨论了该领域最相关的开放挑战，结束了这项研究。",
