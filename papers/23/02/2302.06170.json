    "translated_abstract": "光电倍增管（PMT）的线性响应是光子计数和中微子能量重建的必要属性。使用基于线性烷基苯（LAB）的液体闪烁体研究了PMT的线性有效区域和饱和响应。观察到了两种不同饱和响应之间的相关性，即脉冲形状失真和脉冲面积减小。观察到的脉冲形状为估计脉冲面积相对线性区域提供了有用的信息。这种基于相关性的诊断允许原地估计线性范围，这在以前很具挑战性。利用测得的两个饱和响应之间的相关性，训练人工神经网络（ANN）来预测从观察到的脉冲形状中减小的脉冲面积。ANN预测的脉冲面积减小使得可以预测独立于饱和行为的理想光电子数。这种基于脉冲形状的方法估计PMT的线性范围并使用ANN恢复饱和响应是增强中微子探测器中光子计数和能量重建效率的重要贡献。",
