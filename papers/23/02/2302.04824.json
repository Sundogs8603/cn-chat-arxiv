    "translated_abstract": "锂金属(Li)电池因其高理论能量密度而成为下一代电池系统的潜在选择。然而，由于异质性锂(Li)沉积，会形成称为树枝晶的缺陷，这阻碍了锂金属电池的发展和利用。观察树枝晶形态的非破坏性技术通常使用X射线计算机断层扫描(XCT)提供断面视图。为了获得电池内部的三维结构，图像分割成为定量分析XCT图像的必要条件。本研究提出了一种新的语义分割方法，使用一种名为TransforCNN的基于Transformer的神经网络，能够从XCT数据中分割出树枝晶。此外，我们将所提出的TransforCNN与U-Net、Y-Net和E-Net等三种算法进行了性能比较，这些算法是用于XCT分析的集成网络模型。我们的结果显示在评估过分割时使用TransforCNN的优势。",
