Highlights not only help researchers precisely and quickly identify the contributions of a paper, they also enhance the discoverability of the article via search engines. We aim to automatically construct research highlights given certain segments of a research paper. We use a pointer-generator network with coverage mechanism and a contextual embedding layer at the input that encodes the input tokens into SciBERT embeddings.

    "translated_abstract": "如今，许多研究文章都以研究亮点作为前言，以总结论文的主要发现。亮点不仅帮助研究人员准确快速地识别论文的贡献，还通过搜索引擎增加了文章的可发现性。我们的目标是在给定研究论文的特定段落的情况下自动构建研究亮点。我们使用了一个具有覆盖机制和上下文嵌入层的指针生成网络，将输入标记编码为SciBERT嵌入。我们在基准数据集CSPubSum上测试了我们的模型，并且还提出了MixSub，一个用于自动生成研究亮点的新的跨学科论文语料库。对于CSPubSum和MixSub，我们观察到所提出的模型相对于相关变体和文献中提出的其他模型来说具有最佳性能。在CSPubSum数据集上，我们的模型在只使用论文的摘要作为输入时表现最佳。",
