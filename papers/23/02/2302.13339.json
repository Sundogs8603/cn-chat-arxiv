    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering can explore consistent information from different views to guide clustering. Most existing works focus on pursuing shallow consistency in the feature space and integrating the information of multiple views into a unified representation for clustering. These methods did not fully consider and explore the consistency in the semantic space. To address this issue, we proposed a novel Multi-level Consistency Collaborative learning framework (MCoCo) for multi-view clustering. Specifically, MCoCo jointly learns cluster assignments of multiple views in feature space and aligns semantic labels of different views in semantic space by contrastive learning. Further, we designed a multi-level consistency collaboration strategy, which utilizes the consistent information of semantic space as a self-supervised signal to collaborate with the cluster assignments in feature space. Thus, different levels of spaces collaborate with each other while achieving their own consistency goal",

    "translated_abstract": "多视角聚类可以利用不同视角的一致信息指导聚类。大多数现有工作都专注于在特征空间中追求浅层次的一致性，并将多个视角的信息集成到一个统一的表示中进行聚类。这些方法没有充分考虑和探索语义空间中的一致性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的多级一致性协作学习框架(MCoCo)来进行多视角聚类。具体来说，MCoCo通过对比学习，在特征空间中联合学习多个视角的集群分配，并在语义空间中对不同视角的语义标签进行对齐。此外，我们设计了一种多级一致性协作策略，利用语义空间的一致信息作为自监督信号与特征空间中的集群分配进行协作。因此，不同级别的空间相互协作，同时实现自己的一致性目标。",
