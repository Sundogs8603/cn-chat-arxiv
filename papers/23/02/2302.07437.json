    "translated_abstract": "Baum-Welch（B-W）算法是推断隐马尔可夫模型(HMM)最广泛接受的方法。 然而，它很容易陷入局部最优，而且对于许多实时应用来说速度太慢。文献中提出了一种基于矩法（MOM）的HMM的谱学习（SHMM），旨在克服这些障碍。尽管有这样的承诺，但SHMM的渐近理论一直很难得到，而SHMM的长期性能可能会由于误差的无限传播而降低。在本文中，我们(1)提供了SHMM似然估计的近似误差的渐近分布，(2)提出了一种新算法称为投影SHMM（PSHMM），它可以减轻误差传播问题，(3)开发了SHMM和PSHMM的在线学习变体，以适应潜在的非平稳性。我们在模拟数据和来自真实世界应用的数据上比较了SHMM、PSHMM和B-W算法的性能。",

The results show that PSHMM performs better than other methods."
