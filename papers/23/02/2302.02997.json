Our algorithm works by alternating between two steps. In one, it finds an assignment of the input representations to the information to be erased, and in the other, it creates projections of both the input representations and the information to be erased into a joint latent space. We test our algorithm on an extensive array of datasets, including a Twitter dataset with multiple guarded attributes, the BiasBios dataset and the BiasBench benchmark. The last benchmark includes four datasets with various types of protected attributes. Our results demonstrate that bias can often be removed in our setup. We also discuss the limitations of our approach when there is a strong entanglement between the main task and the information to be erased.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了分配-最大化谱属性去除（AMSAL）算法，该算法可在对齐属性隐含于输入样例中时消除神经表征中的信息。我们的算法通过交替两步操作来实现。第一步，找到输入表征与要删除的信息之间的匹配，第二步，将输入表征和要删除的信息投影到相同的潜在空间中。我们在多个数据集上测试了我们的算法，其中包括一个带有多个受保护属性的Twitter数据集，BiasBios数据集和BiasBench基准测试。 BiasBench 基准测试包括四个具有各种类型受保护属性的数据集。我们的结果表明：我们的算法可以有效消除偏见。我们还讨论了当主任务与要删除的信息之间存在强耦合时，我们算法的限制。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes the AMSAL algorithm to erase implicit information in neural representations that are aligned to inputs. The algorithm uses alternating steps to find the matching between inputs and information to be erased, and to project them into a joint latent space. The experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in removing bias on various datasets."
