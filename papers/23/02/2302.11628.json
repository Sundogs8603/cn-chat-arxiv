    "translated_abstract": "稀疏的或$\\ell_0$对抗攻击会任意扰动未知的特征子集。$\\ell_0$鲁棒性分析特别适用于异构（表格）数据，其中特征具有不同的类型或尺度。目前最先进的$\\ell_0$认证防御基于随机平滑，并仅适用于逃避攻击。本文提出了特征分区聚合（FPA）--一种针对$\\ell_0$逃避、后门和污染攻击的认证防御。FPA通过集成生成更强的鲁棒性保证，其子模型是在不相交的特征集上训练的。与最先进的$\\ell_0$防御相比，FPA速度提高了多达3000倍，并提供了更大的中位数鲁棒性保证（例如，对于CIFAR10的中位数证书为13像素，MNIST的中位数证书为12像素，Weather的中位数证书为4个特征，Ames的中位数证书为3个特征），这意味着FPA能够免费提供额外的鲁棒性维度。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a certified defense method called Feature Partition Aggregation (FPA) against $\\ell_0$ evasion, backdoor, and poisoning attacks. Compared to existing defenses, FPA is faster, provides larger robustness guarantees, and offers additional dimensions of robustness at no cost."
