    "translated_abstract": "对于真实世界应用来说，训练对分布变化具有鲁棒性的机器学习模型非常重要。一些鲁棒训练算法（例如Group DRO）专注于群体变化，并需要在所有训练点上提供群体信息。其他不需要群体注释的方法（例如CVaR DRO）可能过于保守，因为它们会简单地加权计算损失较大的点，而这些点可能是一个虚构的集合，不对应真实世界中的任何有意义的群体（例如，当高损失点是随机错标的训练点时）。在这项研究中，我们通过假设一种更微妙的群体转变形式来解决先前方法的局限性：在给定标签的条件下，我们假设真实的群体函数（群体指示器）是简单的。例如，我们可能期望群体转变发生在低比特率特征上（例如图像背景、光照）。因此，我们的目标是学习一个能够在由这些低比特率特征实现的简单群体函数上保持高准确性的模型。",
