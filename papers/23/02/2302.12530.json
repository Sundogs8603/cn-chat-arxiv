The modification, addition and deletion of words in sentence pairs may make it difficult for the model to predict their relationship. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Dual Path Modeling Framework to enhance the model's ability to perceive subtle differences in sentence pairs by separately modeling affinity and difference semantics. Based on dual-path modeling framework we design the Dual Path Modeling Network (DPM-Net) to recognize semantic relations. And we conduct extensive experiments on 10 well-studied semantic matching and robustness test datasets, and the experimental results show that our proposed method achieves consistent improvements over baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于Transformer的预训练模型在语义匹配方面取得了巨大的进展。然而，现有的模型仍然缺乏捕捉微妙差异的能力。在句子对中修改、添加和删除单词可能使得模型难以预测它们之间的关系。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了一个新颖的双路径建模框架，通过分别建模亲和和差异语义来增强模型感知句子对中微妙差异的能力。基于这个双路径建模框架，我们设计了双路径建模网络（DPM-Net）来识别语义关系。我们在10个广泛研究的语义匹配和鲁棒性测试数据集上进行了大量实验，实验结果表明，我们提出的方法相对于基线方法实现了一致的改进。",
