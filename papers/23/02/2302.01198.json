    "translated_abstract": "现有的链路预测因果模型假设存在一组固有的节点因子，即在节点出生时就定义的固有特征，它们控制着图中链路的因果演化。然而，在某些因果任务中，链路形成是路径依赖的：链路干预的结果取决于现有的链路。不幸的是，这些现有的因果方法并不适用于路径依赖的链路形成，因为链路之间的级联功能依赖（由路径依赖性产生）要么无法识别，要么需要大量不切实际的控制变量。为了克服这个问题，我们开发了第一个能够处理链路预测中路径依赖的因果模型。在这项工作中，我们引入了因果提升的概念，这是一种独立于图的因果模型的不变性，可以利用有限的干预数据来识别因果链路预测查询。此外，我们展示了结构对两个节点之间嵌入的低维表示的方式。",
