After formulating a suitable information-based objective, we employ black-box variational methods to simultaneously estimate it and optimize the designs in a single stochastic gradient scheme. In addition, to accommodate discrete actions within our framework, we propose leveraging continuous relaxation schemes, which can naturally be integrated into our variational objective. As a result, CO-BED provides a general and automated solution to a wide range of contextual optimization problems. We illustrate its effectiveness in a number of experiments, where CO-BED demonstrates competitive performance even when compared to bespoke, model-specific alternatives.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们通过贝叶斯实验设计的视角对上下文优化问题进行了形式化，并提出了CO-BED - 一个通用的、与模型无关的框架，用于使用信息理论原则设计上下文实验。在制定合适的基于信息的目标后，我们采用黑箱变分方法在单一随机梯度方案中同时估计和优化设计。此外，为了适应我们框架中的离散动作，我们提议利用连续松弛方案，这可以自然地集成到我们变分目标中。因此，CO-BED为各种上下文优化问题提供了通用的自动化解决方案。我们在许多实验中演示了其有效性，即使与定制的、特定于模型的替代方法相比，CO-BED也表现出了竞争性能。",
