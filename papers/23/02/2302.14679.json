    "translated_abstract": "电子健康记录（EHRs）包含敏感的患者信息，在共享此类数据时存在隐私问题。合成数据生成是缓解这些风险的一种有希望的解决方案，通常依赖于深度生成模型，如生成对抗网络（GANs）。然而，最近的研究表明，扩散模型在GANs之上具有几个优势，例如生成更真实的合成数据和稳定的训练以生成包括图像、文本和声音在内的数据模态。在这项工作中，我们研究了扩散模型在生成真实混合类型表格EHRs方面的潜力，将TabDDPM模型与现有方法在四个数据集上进行了数据质量、实用性、隐私和增强方面的比较。我们的实验证明，除隐私方面外，TabDDPM在所有评估指标上均优于现有模型，这证实了隐私和实用性之间的权衡。",
