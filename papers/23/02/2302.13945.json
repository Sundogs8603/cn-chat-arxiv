    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑跨桶差分隐私联邦线性背景下的上下文匹配问题，在不损害每个用户隐私的情况下，多个沉积物（代理）与本地用户互动，并通过中央服务器进行通信以实现协作。本文识别了现有技术中的三个问题：(i)声明的隐私保护失效和(ii)由于噪声计算错误而导致的不正确的遗憾界，以及(iii)不可信的通信成本。为了解决这些问题，我们采取了一个两步原则性的方法。首先，我们设计了一个算法框架，包括一个通用的联邦LCB算法和灵活的隐私协议。然后，利用所提出的框架，我们研究了两种不同隐私约束下的联邦LCB。我们首先在桶级本地差分隐私下建立了隐私和遗憾保证，修复了现有技术中存在的问题。为了进一步提高遗憾表现，我们接下来考虑了差分privacy的洗牌模型。",
