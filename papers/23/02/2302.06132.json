    "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to discover missing relations of query entities. Current text-based models utilize the entity name and description to infer the tail entity given the head entity and a certain relation. Existing approaches also consider the neighborhood of the head entity. However, these methods tend to model the neighborhood using a flat structure and are only restricted to 1-hop neighbors. In this work, we propose a node neighborhood-enhanced framework for knowledge graph completion. It models the head entity neighborhood from multiple hops using graph neural networks to enrich the head node information. Moreover, we introduce an additional edge link prediction task to improve KGC. Evaluation on two public datasets shows that this framework is simple yet effective. The case study also shows that the model is able to predict explainable predictions.",

    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱补全旨在发现查询实体的缺失关系。目前的基于文本的模型利用实体名称和描述推断头实体和特定关系给定的尾实体。现有方法还考虑了头实体的邻居。然而，这些方法往往使用扁平结构模拟邻居，且仅限于1跳邻居。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种增强知识图谱补全的节点邻居框架。它利用图神经网络对头实体邻居进行多跳建模，以丰富头节点信息。此外，我们引入了额外的边连接预测任务来改进知识图谱补全。在两个公共数据集上的评估表明，该框架简单而有效。案例研究还表明，模型能够预测可解释的预测结果。",
