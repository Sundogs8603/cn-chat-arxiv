    "translated_abstract": "近年来，MRI技术的进步导致了大型数据集的创建。随着数据量的增加，在这些数据集中定位同一患者的先前扫描变得困难（这个过程称为再识别）。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个名为DeepBrainPrint的人工智能医学图像检索框架，用于检索同一患者的脑MRI扫描。我们的框架是一种半自监督对比深度学习方法，具有三个主要创新。首先，我们使用自监督和监督范式的组合来创建有效的脑指纹，以用于实时图像检索。其次，我们使用特殊的加权函数来引导训练并提高模型收敛性。第三，我们引入了新的图像转换方法，以提高在不同扫描对比度（即不同扫描反差）下的检索稳健性，并考虑患者的年龄和疾病进展。",
