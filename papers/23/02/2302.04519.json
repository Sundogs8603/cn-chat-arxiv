    "translated_abstract": "强化学习在网络协议的开发中已经取得了重要的进展。然而，基于强化学习的协议仍处于初级阶段，需要大量的研究来构建可部署的解决方案。基于强化学习开发协议是一个复杂而具有挑战性的过程，涉及多个模型设计决策，并需要在真实和模拟的网络拓扑中进行重要的训练和评估。网络模拟器为基于强化学习的协议提供了高效的训练环境，因为它们是确定性的，可以并行运行。在本文中，我们介绍了一个可扩展和适应性强的仿真平台RayNet，用于开发基于强化学习的网络协议。RayNet将全面可编程的网络模拟器OMNeT++与可扩展的分布式强化学习训练平台Ray/RLlib进行了整合。RayNet旨在有序地开发基于强化学习的网络协议，使得研究者可以专注于问题本身而不是实现细节。",
