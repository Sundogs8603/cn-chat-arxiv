Causal discovery, which involves estimating causal relationships from observational data, holds the potential to play a significant role in extracting actionable insights about human health. In this study, we present a novel constraint-based causal discovery approach for autocorrelated and non-stationary time series data (CDANs). Our proposed method addresses several limitations of existing causal discovery methods for autocorrelated and non-stationary time series data, such as high dimensionality, the inability to identify lagged causal relationships, and overlooking changing modules. Our approach identifies lagged and instantaneous/contemporaneous causal relationships along with changing modules that vary over time. The method optimizes the conditioning sets in a constraint-based search by considering lagged parents instead",

    "translated_abstract": "时间序列数据在医疗领域的许多方面中被发现，如医学时间序列、电子健康记录（EHR）、生命体征测量和可穿戴设备。因果发现涉及从观测数据中估计因果关系，对于提取有关人类健康的行动洞察力具有重要潜力。在本研究中，我们提出了一种针对自相关和非平稳时间序列数据的新型基于约束的因果发现方法（CDANs）。我们提出的方法解决了现有因果发现方法在自相关和非平稳时间序列数据方面的几个限制，如高维度、无法识别滞后因果关系和忽视变化模式。我们的方法识别出随时间变化的滞后和即时/同时的因果关系以及变化的模块。该方法通过考虑滞后父节点来优化约束搜索中的条件集合。",
