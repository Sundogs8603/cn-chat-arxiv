    "translated_abstract": "生成流网络（或简称GFlowNets）是一类通过“推理即控制”学习采样复杂组合结构的概率代理。它们在从给定的能量景观中生成高质量、多样化的候选方面表现出巨大的潜力。然而，现有的GFlowNets仅适用于确定性环境，并在具有随机动态的更一般任务中失败，这可能限制了它们的适用性。为了克服这一挑战，本文介绍了一种新的算法，称为随机GFlowNets，它将GFlowNets扩展到随机环境。通过将状态转移分解为两个步骤，随机GFlowNets分离了环境随机性并学习了一个动态模型来捕捉它。广泛的实验结果表明，随机GFlowNets在具有随机动态的各种标准基准测试中，相较于标准GFlowNets以及MCMC和基于RL的方法，具有显著的优势。",
