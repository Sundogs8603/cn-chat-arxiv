    "translated_abstract": "欺诈检测是识别、监控和预防复杂数据中的潜在欺诈活动。机器学习提供了一种新的数据驱动方法来处理欺诈行为。本文提出了一种基于梯度增强和神经网络的深度增强决策树（DBDT）方法，它首先构建了软决策树，然后将其嵌入神经网络框架用于最终分类，既可以利用决策树的可解释性，又可以提高神经网络的表示学习能力。此外，我们提出一种新的过采样策略来缓解数据不平衡带来的影响。实验结果表明，我们的方法在准确性、可解释性和效率方面优于现有的最先进方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a deep boosting decision tree approach for fraud detection, which combines the interpretability of decision trees and the representation learning ability of neural networks. The proposed oversampling strategy is also introduced to alleviate the problem of imbalanced data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency."
