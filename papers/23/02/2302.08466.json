    "translated_abstract": "我们研究设计黑盒模型提取攻击，该攻击可以通过一个预测API从一个公开可用的数据集向目标ML模型发送最小数量的查询，以创建一个具有信息丰富度和分布等价性的目标副本。首先，我们定义了分布等价和最大信息模型提取攻击，并将它们简化为一个变分优化问题。攻击者顺序解决这个优化问题，选择最具信息量的查询，同时最大化熵和降低目标和盗窃模型之间的不匹配。这导致了一种基于主动抽样的查询选择算法Marich，它是模型无关的。然后，我们在不同的文本和图像数据集以及不同的模型上评估了Marich。Marich提取的模型实现了真实模型准确性的60-95％，并使用了来自公开可用数据集的1,000-8,500个查询。",
