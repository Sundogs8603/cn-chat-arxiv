    "translated_abstract": "机器学习技术可以促进恶意软件（简称为恶意软件）的自动检测，但受到逃避攻击的影响。许多研究采用启发式方法来应对这些攻击，缺乏理论保证和有效的防御。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的对抗性训练框架，称为合理对抗性恶意软件检测（PAD），它针对强大的优化方法提供了收敛保证。PAD建立在可学习的凸度量上，量化分布式离散扰动，以保护恶意软件检测器免受攻击者的影响，对于平滑检测器，可以进行理论上的对抗性训练。为了提高防御效果，我们提出了一种新的混合攻击方法来实现PAD，以增强基于深度神经网络的测量和恶意软件检测器。在两个Android恶意软件数据集上的实验结果表明：（i）所提出的方法明显优于现有技术。",
