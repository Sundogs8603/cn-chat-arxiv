    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种名为黎曼流匹配（RFM）的框架，用于在流形上训练连续标准化流。现有的流形生成建模方法要么需要昂贵的模拟，要么无法本质上扩展到高维度，要么使用限制量的近似来产生有偏的训练目标。黎曼流匹配绕过了这些限制，并提供了比以前方法更多的优势：它在简单几何上无需模拟，不需要散度计算，并以闭合形式计算其目标向量场。 RFM的关键因素是构建一个相对简单的前度量，以定义目标向量场，其中包括现有的欧几里得情况。为了扩展到一般几何，我们依靠使用谱分解来有效地即兴计算前度量。我们的方法在现实世界的非欧几里得数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并通过在3D网格和双曲空间上训练标准化流来证明其功效。",
