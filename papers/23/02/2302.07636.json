    "translated_abstract": "采用局部差分隐私（LDP）的私密文本重写是一种最近的方法，可以在正式保证对个人的隐私保护的同时，共享敏感的文本文档。然而，现有的系统存在许多问题，如形式上数学缺陷、不切实际的隐私保证、仅针对个别单词的私密化，以及缺乏透明度和可重复性等。本文提出了一个新系统“DP-BART”，在很大程度上优于现有的LDP系统。我们的方法使用了一种新的剪辑方法、迭代剪枝以及进一步培训内部表示，极大地减少了需要DP保证的噪音量。我们在五个大小不同的文本数据集上运行实验，在不同的隐私保证下重写这些数据集，并评估经过重写的文本的下游文本分类任务。最后，我们对私密文本重写方法及其限制进行了全面的讨论，包括严格性问题。",
