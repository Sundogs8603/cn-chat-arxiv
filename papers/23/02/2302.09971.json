    "translated_abstract": "尽管推荐系统在网络内容平台中起着关键作用，但挖掘用户的兴趣仍然是一个重大挑战。现有方法通过利用用户的行为（点击、查看等）来预测用户的兴趣，但当用户进行不稳定的活动时，当前的解决方案效果不佳。这些情况包括新用户和行为频率较低的稀疏用户。我们统一将这两种用户类型称为“冷用户”，这在网络内容平台中非常常见，但经常被忽视。为了解决这个问题，我们通过将用户的社交兴趣（如友谊、关注博主、兴趣组等）与活动行为相结合，增强用户兴趣的表示。因此，在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为SocialNet的新算法，采用两阶段方法逐步提取粗粒度和细粒度的社交兴趣。我们的技术随后将SocialNet的输出与推荐系统的传统方法相结合，实现了更好的视频推荐效果。",
