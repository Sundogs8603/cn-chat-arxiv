    "translated_abstract": "传统上通过模拟和计算数值模型解决Navier-Stokes方程来估计流体动力学，即使在高端硬件上也要耗费大量的计算时间和资源，这是一个极其复杂的问题。近年来，机器学习，特别是基于图神经网络（GNN）和变种的方法已经开始尝试解决此类问题，但是这些方法都只针对几何形状固定的静态场景中的静态对象进行了数据集的训练和评估。我们试图超越现有工作的复杂度，引入一种新的模型、方法和基准。我们提出了EAGLE，一个包含1.1百万个二维网格的大规模数据集，这些网格是由一个移动流体源引起的不稳定流体动力学模拟生成的，其相互作用导致了非线性场景结构，其中包括三种不同类型的600个不同场景。为了对这个具有挑战性的EAGLE数据集进行未来的压力和速度预测，我们引入了一种新的网格变换器，它利用了节点聚类、图池化和全局池化。",
