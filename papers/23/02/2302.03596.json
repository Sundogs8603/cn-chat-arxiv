    "translated_abstract": "生成图是理解其非欧几里得结构复杂性的真实任务的主要挑战。虽然扩散模型在图生成方面最近取得了显着成功，但它们不适合建模图的结构信息，因为学习去噪声样本不能明确地捕捉图的拓扑结构。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一个新颖的生成框架，通过预测扩散过程的目标，即具有正确拓扑信息的原始图作为数据的加权平均值，建模了图的拓扑结构。具体而言，我们将生成过程设计为一个以数据分布中的终点为条件的扩散过程混合，它将过程推向预测的目标，并实现快速收敛。我们引入了预测目标的新型无仿真训练目标，并进一步讨论了将这种策略纳入图生成任务中的优势。我们在几个基准数据集上的实验表明，我们提出的方法在各种评估指标上均实现了最先进的性能。",
