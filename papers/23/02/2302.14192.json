    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于外分布检测（OOD）在现实应用中的关键作用，引起了人们的关注。OOD检测器旨在区分培训分布之外的样本，以避免机器学习模型对OOD数据的过度自信预测。现有的检测器主要依赖于logit、中间特征空间、softmax分数或重构损失，它们能够产生有希望的结果。但是，这些方法大多数是针对图像领域开发的。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于重构的OOD检测器，以在雷达领域进行操作。我们的方法利用自动编码器（AE）及其潜在表示来检测OOD样本。我们提出了两种得分，包括基于修补程序的重构损失和从每个修补程序的潜在表示计算得出的能量值。在使用60 GHz sh收集的数据集上，我们实现了90.72％的AUROC。",
