    "translated_abstract": "Langevin 动力学被广泛用于抽样高维、非高斯分布，其密度已知但常数未知。特别感兴趣的是未修正的 Langevin 算法 (ULA)，它直接离散化 Langevin 动力学以估计目标分布上的期望。我们研究了使用交通图来近似标准化目标分布的方法，以预处理和加速 Langevin 动力学的收敛。我们展示了在连续时间下，当将交通图应用于 Langevin 动力学时，结果是具有由交通图定义的度量的 Riemann 流形 Langevin 动力学（RMLD）。我们还展示了将交通图应用于不可逆扰动的 ULA 会产生原动力学的几何信息不可逆扰动 （GiIrr）。这些联系表明了学习度量和扰动的更系统的方法，并提供了描述 RMLD 的替代离散化方法。",
