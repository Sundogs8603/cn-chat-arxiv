    "translated_abstract": "唤醒词检测存在于大多数智能家居和便携设备中。它为这些设备提供了在召唤时“唤醒”的能力，并节省了功率和计算成本。本文着重探讨对齐在开发回答通用短语的唤醒词系统中的作用。我们讨论了三种方法。第一种是基于对齐的方法，模型使用逐帧交叉熵进行训练。第二种是无对齐的方法，模型使用CTC进行训练。我们提出的第三种是混合解决方案，在此方案中，模型使用少量对齐数据进行训练，然后使用大量未对齐的数据进行调优。我们比较了三种方法，并评估了不同对齐到未对齐比率对混合训练的影响。我们的结果表明，在目标操作点上，无对齐系统比基于对齐更好，并且在仅使用20％的数据的情况下，我们可以训练一个符合我们的初始约束的模型。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper compares the effectiveness of alignment-based, alignment-free, and hybrid approaches in handling wake word detection and finds that the alignment-free system performs better than the alignment-based method at the target operating point. Also, a hybrid method using a small set of aligned data and a large set of unaligned data can train a good model while satisfying the initial constraints."
