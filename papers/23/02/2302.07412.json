    "translated_abstract": "在不确定性概率领域中使用“理想赌博”的理论作为启发，我提出了一种关于“理想事物”的理论。它的目的是建模一个主体对哪些事物是理想的信念。事物本身的属性并不重要，也不重要它们被定义为理想的意义。它可以应用于赌博，如果一个主体接受它们，则称它们为理想赌博，但同样也可以应用于披萨，如果我的朋友阿瑟喜欢吃它们，则称它们为理想披萨。其他有用的例子包括命题、马彩票或任何上述事物之间的偏好。通过抽象的闭合算子来施加推理规则，并称遵循这些规则的模型为连贯的。我考虑了两种类型的模型，每种模型都能捕捉到主体对哪些事物是理想的信念：一种是理想事物的集合模型，一种是理想集合的集合模型。",
