    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于人类词汇关联的社交媒体话题检测框架。在社交媒体中识别讨论的话题已经成为一个重要的挑战。目前这个领域的大部分工作都是在英语方面的，但是在波斯语方面也做了很多工作，特别是波斯语的微博。此外，现有的工作更多地关注探索频繁模式或语义关系，忽视了语言的结构方法。本文提出了一种使用人类词汇关联的话题检测框架。这种方法使用了模仿心理能力进行词汇关联。该方法还计算出了关联引力力量来显示词语的关联程度。利用这个参数，可以生成一个图，通过嵌入这个图并使用聚类方法，可以提取出话题。这个方法已经应用于从Telegram收集的波斯语数据集上。进行了多个实验研究。",
