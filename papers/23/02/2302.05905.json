Compared to the imaging domain, which is rich with large available datasets, the number of data instances for the motion domain is limited, particularly for the animation of animals and exotic creatures (e.g., dragons), which have unique skeletons and motion patterns. In this work, we present a Single Motion Diffusion Model, dubbed SinMDM, a model designed to learn the internal motifs of a single motion sequence with arbitrary topology and synthesize motions of arbitrary length that are faithful to them. We harness the power of diffusion models and present a denoising network explicitly designed for the task of learning from a single input motion. SinMDM is designed to be a lightweight architecture, which avoids overfitting by using a shallow network with local attention layers that narrow the receptive field and encourage motion dive",

    "translated_abstract": "合成逼真的人类、动物甚至是虚构生物的动画长期以来一直是艺术家和计算机图形专业人员的目标。与图像领域相比，运动领域的数据实例数量非常有限，特别是对于动物和异国情调生物（例如龙），它们具有独特的骨架和运动模式。在本研究中，我们提出了一种称为单一动作扩散模型（SinMDM）的模型，旨在学习任意拓扑结构的单个动作序列的内部模式，并合成具有其特点的任意长度的运动。我们利用扩散模型的作用，并提出了一种专门设计用于从单个输入动作学习的去噪网络。SinMDM采用轻量级架构设计，通过使用具有本地关注层的浅层网络来缩小感受野并促进运动多样化，避免了过度拟合。",
