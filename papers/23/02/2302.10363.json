    "abstract": "We study the problem of imputing missing values in a dataset, which has important applications in many domains. The key to missing value imputation is to capture the data distribution with incomplete samples and impute the missing values accordingly. In this paper, by leveraging the fact that any two batches of data with missing values come from the same data distribution, we propose to impute the missing values of two batches of samples by transforming them into a latent space through deep invertible functions and matching them distributionally. To learn the transformations and impute the missing values simultaneously, a simple and well-motivated algorithm is proposed. Our algorithm has fewer hyperparameters to fine-tune and generates high-quality imputations regardless of how missing values are generated. Extensive experiments over a large number of datasets and competing benchmark algorithms show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了数据集中缺失值插值的问题，该问题在许多领域有重要应用。缺失值插值的关键是利用不完整样本捕获数据分布，并相应地插补缺失值。本文通过利用任意两个具有缺失值的数据批次来自同一数据分布的事实，建议通过深度可逆函数将它们变换为潜在空间并进行分布匹配来插补两个样本批次的缺失值。为了同时学习变换和插值缺失值，提出了一个简单而有动机的算法。该算法有较少的超参数需调整，无论缺失值如何生成，都能生成高质量的插补结果。在大量数据集和竞争基准算法的广泛实验中，证明了我们的方法达到了最先进的性能。",
