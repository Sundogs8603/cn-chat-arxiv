    "abstract": "Noise injection-based method has been shown to be able to improve the robustness of artificial neural networks in previous work. In this work, we propose a novel noise injection-based training scheme for better model robustness. Specifically, we first develop a likelihood ratio method to estimate the gradient with respect to both synaptic weights and noise levels for stochastic gradient descent training. Then, we design an approximation for the vanilla noise injection-based training method to reduce memory and improve computational efficiency. Next, we apply our proposed scheme to spiking neural networks and evaluate the performance of classification accuracy and robustness on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Experiment results show that our proposed method achieves a much better performance on adversarial robustness and slightly better performance on original accuracy, compared with the conventional gradient-based training method.",

    "translated_abstract": "先前的工作表明，噪音注入方法可以改进人工神经网络的鲁棒性。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于噪声注入训练方案的模型鲁棒性改进方法。具体地，我们首先开发了一个似然比方法来估计随机梯度下降训练下的突触权重和噪声水平的梯度。接着，我们设计了一种逼近的传统噪声注入训练方法，以减少内存并提高计算效率。然后，我们将我们提出的方案应用于尖峰神经网络，并在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集上评估分类准确性和鲁棒性性能。实验结果表明，与传统的基于梯度的训练方法相比，我们提出的方法在对抗鲁棒性上表现更好，在原始准确性上略微更好。",
