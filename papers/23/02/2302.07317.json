    "abstract": "Label efficiency has become an increasingly important objective in deep learning applications. Active learning aims to reduce the number of labeled examples needed to train deep networks, but the empirical performance of active learning algorithms can vary dramatically across datasets and applications. It is difficult to know in advance which active learning strategy will perform well or best in a given application. To address this, we propose the first adaptive algorithm selection strategy for deep active learning. For any unlabeled dataset, our (meta) algorithm TAILOR (Thompson ActIve Learning algORithm selection) iteratively and adaptively chooses among a set of candidate active learning algorithms. TAILOR uses novel reward functions aimed at gathering class-balanced examples. Extensive experiments in multi-class and multi-label applications demonstrate TAILOR's effectiveness in achieving accuracy comparable or better than that of the best of the candidate algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "标签效率已成为深度学习应用中越来越重要的目标。主动学习旨在减少训练深度网络所需的标记示例数量，但是，在不同的数据集和应用中，主动学习算法的实证性能可能会大幅度变化。事先很难知道哪种主动学习策略在特定应用中表现良好或最佳。为解决这个问题，我们提出了第一个用于深度主动学习的自适应算法选择策略。对于任何未标记的数据集，我们的(meta)算法TAILOR (Thompson ActIve Learning algORithm selection)迭代地并自适应地选择一组候选主动学习算法。TAILOR使用旨在收集类平衡示例的新奖励函数。在多类和多标签应用的大量实验中，TAILOR在实现与候选算法中最佳算法相当或更高的准确性方面表现出良好的效果。",
