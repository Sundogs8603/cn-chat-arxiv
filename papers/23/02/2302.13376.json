To that end, we present EfficientPunct, an ensemble method with a multimodal time-delay neural network that outperforms the current best model by 1.0 F1 points, using less than a tenth of its inference network parameters. We streamline a speech recognizer to efficiently output hidden layer acoustic embeddings for punctuation restoration, as well as BERT to extract meaningful text embeddings. By using forced alignment and temporal convolutions, we eliminate the need for attention-based fusion, greatly increasing computational efficiency and raising performance. EfficientPunct sets a new state of the art with an ensemble that weights BERT's purely language-based predictions slightly more than the multimodal network's predictions.

    "translated_abstract": "标点修复在自动语音识别的后处理过程中起着至关重要的作用，但对模型效率的要求是关键。为此，我们提出了EfficientPunct，这是一种使用多模态时间延迟神经网络的集成方法，通过使用不到十分之一的推理网络参数，优于当前最佳模型1.0个F1分数。我们简化了语音识别器，以有效地输出用于标点修复的隐藏层声学嵌入，同时使用BERT提取有意义的文本嵌入。通过使用强制对齐和时间卷积，我们消除了注意力融合的必要性，极大提高了计算效率并提高了性能。EfficientPunct通过一个集成方法，对BERT纯粹基于语言的预测的权重略高于多模态网络的预测，树立了一个新的技术水平。我们的代码可在 https://githu",
