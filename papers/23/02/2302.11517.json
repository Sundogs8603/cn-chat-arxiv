Early detection of hard exudates plays a crucial role in identifying DR, which aids in treating diabetes and preventing vision loss. However, the unique characteristics of hard exudates, ranging from their inconsistent shapes to indistinct boundaries, pose significant challenges to existing segmentation techniques. To address these issues, we present a novel supervised contrastive learning framework to optimize hard exudate segmentation. Specifically, we introduce a patch-wise density contrasting scheme to distinguish between areas with varying lesion concentrations, and therefore improve the model's proficiency in segmenting small lesions.

    "translated_abstract": "糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）是导致全球盲目的主要原因。早期检测硬渗出物对于识别DR至关重要，有助于治疗糖尿病和预防视力损失。针对现有分割技术面临的硬渗出物独特特征，从不一致的形状到模糊的边界，我们提出了一个新颖的监督对比学习框架来优化硬渗出物分割。具体地，我们引入了一个基于区域的密度对比方案来区分不同病变浓度的区域，从而提高模型在分割小病变方面的能力。为了处理模糊的边界，我们开发了一个判别性边缘检查模块来动态分析边界周围的像素，并准确勾勒出渗出物。",
