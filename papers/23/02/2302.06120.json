    "translated_abstract": "RNA通过其结构在许多生物活动中起着重要作用，其功能往往受其结构的影响。预测RNA序列中每个核苷酸之间的结构接近性可以表征RNA的结构信息。传统上，机器学习模型使用专家设计的特征并在数据稀缺的标记数据集上进行训练来解决这个问题。我们发现，基于蛋白质共进化的Transformer深度神经网络学习的知识可以转移到RNA接触预测任务中。由于蛋白质数据集比RNA接触预测的数据集大几个数量级，因此我们的发现和随后的框架极大地减少了数据稀缺的瓶颈。实验证实，使用公开的蛋白质模型进行转移学习的RNA接触预测效果得到了显著提高。我们的发现表明，蛋白质学习的结构模式可以转移到RNA上，为RNA结构预测开辟了潜在的新方向。",
