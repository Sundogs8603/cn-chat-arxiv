    "translated_abstract": "在药物靶向相互作用(DTI)领域中汇集制药数据具有提供挽救生命的突破的潜力。然而，由于监管限制和商业利益，这是非常困难的。本文提出了联邦学习的应用，认为这与行业的限制是和解的，因为它不需要共享任何信息，这些信息可以揭示实体的数据或任何其他的高水平总结。当运用于代表性的GraphDTA模型和KIBA数据集时，相对于最佳的非隐私保护替代方法，它可以实现高达15%的性能提升。我们广泛的一系列实验表明，在DTI数据集中，与其他领域不同的是，非IID数据分布不会降低联邦学习的性能。此外，我们确定了添加新数据的益处与添加更多客户的成本之间的实质性平衡。",
