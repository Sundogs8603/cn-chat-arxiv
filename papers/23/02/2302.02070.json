    "abstract": "Existing image augmentation methods consist of two categories: perturbation-based methods and generative methods. Perturbation-based methods apply pre-defined perturbations to augment an original image, but only locally vary the image, thus lacking image diversity. In contrast, generative methods bring more image diversity in the augmented images but may not preserve semantic consistency, thus incorrectly changing the essential semantics of the original image. To balance image diversity and semantic consistency in augmented images, we propose SGID, a Semantic-guided Generative Image augmentation method with Diffusion models for image classification. Specifically, SGID employs diffusion models to generate augmented images with good image diversity. More importantly, SGID takes image labels and captions as guidance to maintain semantic consistency between the augmented and original images. Experimental results show that SGID outperforms the best augmentation baseline by 1.72% on ResNet-5",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的图像增强方法分为两类：扰动方法和生成方法。扰动方法对原始图像应用预定义的扰动来增强图像，但只是局部变化图像，因此缺乏图像多样性。相反，生成方法在增强图像中带来更多的图像多样性，但可能无法保持语义一致性，从而错误地改变了原始图像的基本语义。为了在增强图像中平衡图像多样性和语义一致性，我们提出了SGID，一种语义引导生成图像增强方法，使用扩散模型用于图像分类。具体而言，SGID采用扩散模型生成具有良好图像多样性的增强图像。更重要的是，SGID以图像标签和标题作为指导，以保持增强和原始图像之间的语义一致性。实验证明，SGID在ResNet-5上的表现优于最佳增强基线1.72％。",
