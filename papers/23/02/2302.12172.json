    "abstract": "Generated synthetic data in medical research can substitute privacy and security-sensitive data with a large-scale curated dataset, reducing data collection and annotation costs. As part of this effort, we propose UniXGen, a unified chest X-ray and report generation model, with the following contributions. First, we design a unified model for bidirectional chest X-ray and report generation by adopting a vector quantization method to discretize chest X-rays into discrete visual tokens and formulating both tasks as sequence generation tasks. Second, we introduce several special tokens to generate chest X-rays with specific views that can be useful when the desired views are unavailable. Furthermore, UniXGen can flexibly take various inputs from single to multiple views to take advantage of the additional findings available in other X-ray views. We adopt an efficient transformer for computational and memory efficiency to handle the long-range input sequence of multi-view chest X-rays with",
