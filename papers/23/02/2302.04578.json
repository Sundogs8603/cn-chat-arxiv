    "translated_abstract": "最近，扩散模型（DMs）在人工智能艺术领域掀起了一股热潮，但同时也引发了新的版权问题，即侵权者利用未经授权的绘画训练DMs生成类似风格的新颖绘画。为了解决这些新兴的版权问题，我们首次探索并提出利用对抗样本保护人类创造的艺术品的方法。具体而言，我们首先建立了一个理论框架来定义和评估DMs的对抗样本。然后，基于这个框架，我们设计了一种新算法，命名为AdvDM，它通过对从DMs的反向过程中抽样的不同潜变量进行蒙特卡罗估计的对抗样本进行优化。广泛的实验证明，生成的对抗样本可以有效地阻碍DMs提取它们的特征。因此，我们的方法可以成为保护人类艺术家版权的强有力工具，以对抗装备有DMs的侵权者。",
