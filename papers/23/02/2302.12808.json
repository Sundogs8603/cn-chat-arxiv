We leverage the structure of the objective by handling its differentiable and non-differentiable components separately, linearizing only the smooth parts. This provides us with new generalizations of the classical Frank-Wolfe method and the Conditional Gradient Sliding algorithm, that cater to a subclass of non-differentiable problems. Our algorithms rely on a stronger version of the linear minimization oracle, which can be efficiently implemented in several practical applications. We provide the basic version of our method with an affine-invariant analysis and prove global convergence rates for both convex and non-convex objectives. Furthermore, in the convex case, we propose an accelerated method with correspondingly improved complexity. Finally, we provide illustrative experiments to support our theoretical results.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了解决凸和紧集合上的完全复合优化问题的一阶算法。我们通过分别处理可微和不可微组成部分的结构，仅线性化平滑部分，提供了经典Frank-Wolfe方法和Conditional Gradient Sliding算法的新的推广，适用于一类不可微的问题。我们的算法依赖于更强的线性最小化预言子版本，可以在多个实际应用中高效实现。我们为我们的方法提供了基本版本的仿射不变分析，并证明了凸和非凸目标的全局收敛速度。此外，在凸情况下，我们提出了一个加速方法，复杂度相应提高。最后，我们提供了说明性实验来支持我们的理论结果。",
