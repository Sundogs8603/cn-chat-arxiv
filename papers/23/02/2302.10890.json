    "translated_abstract": "可解释的表示学习在创造性智能系统中起着关键作用。在音乐领域，当前的学习算法可以成功地学习各种特征，如音高、音色、和弦、纹理等。然而，大多数方法严重依赖音乐领域知识。现在还不清楚什么样的一般性计算原则会产生可解释的表示，特别是与人类感知保持一致的低维因素。在这项研究中，我们从现代物理学中获得灵感，将物理对称性作为潜在空间的自洽约束条件。特别是，它要求先验模型对潜在状态的动态进行描述，并以某种群变换对其进行等变。我们展示了物理对称性使得模型能够以无监督的方式从未标记的单声道音乐音频中学习一个线性音高因素。此外，相同的方法可以应用于计算机视觉，学习一个三维笛卡尔因素。",
