However, this approach suffers from several deficiencies: it does not scale well with the number of variables and samples in the training data - models tend to grow in size and complexity without an adequate accuracy gain, and it is hard to fine-tune the model coefficients using just genetic operators.

    "translated_abstract": "许多现实世界的系统可以由人类可理解的数学模型描述，这些模型易于分析并有助于解释系统的行为。符号回归是一种可以从数据中自动生成这种模型的方法。历史上，符号回归主要通过遗传编程来实现，这种方法通过遗传操作交叉和突变对候选解的群体进行进化和修改。然而，这种方法存在一些问题：随着训练数据中变量和样本数量的增加，模型的规模和复杂性会增长，但准确性提升不足；仅通过遗传操作很难对模型系数进行微调。最近，人们开始将神经网络应用于学习整个解析模型，即学习模型的结构和系数，采用基于梯度的优化算法。本文提出了一种新颖的基于神经网络的符号回归方法。",
