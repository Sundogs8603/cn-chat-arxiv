    "abstract": "Different proxy variables commonly used in fiscal policy SVARs lead to contradicting conclusions implying that some of the exogeneity assumptions may not be fulfilled. We combine data-driven identification with a novel proxy shrinkage prior which enables us to estimate the effects of fiscal policy shocks without relying on strong assumptions about the validity of the proxy variables. Our results suggest that increasing government spending is a more effective tool to stimulate the economy than reducing taxes. Additionally, we provide evidence that the commonly used proxies in the literature are endogenously related to the structural shocks which leads to biased estimates. We construct new exogenous proxies that can be used in the traditional proxy VAR approach resulting in similar estimates compared to our proxy shrinkage model.",

    "translated_abstract": "在财政政策结构向量自回归中，不同的代理变量会得出冲突的结论，意味着某些外生性假设可能无法满足。我们将数据驱动识别与新型代理收缩先验相结合，使我们能够在不依赖于代理变量有效性的强烈假设的情况下估计财政政策冲击的效应。我们的研究结果表明，增加政府支出是刺激经济的更有效工具比减税。此外，我们提供证据表明，文献中常用的代理变量与结构性冲击具有内生相关性，这导致估计结果存在偏差。我们构建了新的外生代理变量，可以用于传统的代理 VAR 方法中，结果与我们的代理收缩模型相似。",
