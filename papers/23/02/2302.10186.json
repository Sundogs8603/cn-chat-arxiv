    "abstract": "This paper reimagines some aspects of speech processing using speech encoders, specifically about extracting entities directly from speech, with no intermediate textual representation. In human-computer conversations, extracting entities such as names, postal addresses and email addresses from speech is a challenging task. In this paper, we study the impact of fine-tuning pre-trained speech encoders on extracting spoken entities in human-readable form directly from speech without the need for text transcription. We illustrate that such a direct approach optimizes the encoder to transcribe only the entity relevant portions of speech, ignoring the superfluous portions such as carrier phrases and spellings of entities. In the context of dialogs from an enterprise virtual agent, we demonstrate that the 1-step approach outperforms the typical 2-step cascade of first generating lexical transcriptions followed by text-based entity extraction for identifying spoken entities.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文重新构想了语音处理中的一些方面，特别是关于从语音中直接提取实体，而无需中间文本表示。在人与计算机的对话中，从语音中提取实体，如姓名、邮政地址和电子邮件地址，是一项具有挑战性的任务。我们研究了微调预训练语音编码器对从语音中直接提取可读性强的实体的影响，而无需进行文本转录。我们说明这种直接方法优化了编码器，以仅转录语音中与实体相关的部分，忽略了多余的部分，如搭档语或实体拼写。在企业虚拟代理人的对话上下文中，我们展示了一步法的方法优于典型的两步法，即首先产生词汇转录，然后进行基于文本的实体提取以识别口语实体。",
