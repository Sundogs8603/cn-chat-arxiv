    "abstract": "Diffusion models show promising generation capability for a variety of data. Despite their high generation quality, the inference for diffusion models is still time-consuming due to the numerous sampling iterations required. To accelerate the inference, we propose ReDi, a simple yet learning-free Retrieval-based Diffusion sampling framework. From a precomputed knowledge base, ReDi retrieves a trajectory similar to the partially generated trajectory at an early stage of generation, skips a large portion of intermediate steps, and continues sampling from a later step in the retrieved trajectory. We theoretically prove that the generation performance of ReDi is guaranteed. Our experiments demonstrate that ReDi improves the model inference efficiency by 2x speedup. Furthermore, ReDi is able to generalize well in zero-shot cross-domain image generation such as image stylization.",

    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型展现了各种数据的优异生成能力。尽管其生成质量较高，但扩散模型的推断仍然耗时，因为需要大量的采样迭代。为了加速推断过程，我们提出了一种简单但无需学习的基于检索的扩散采样框架（ReDi）。通过预先计算的知识库，ReDi从一个在生成的早期阶段与部分生成轨迹相似的轨迹中检索，跳过大部分中间步骤，并在检索到的轨迹的后续步骤中继续采样。我们在理论上证明了ReDi的生成性能是有保证的。我们的实验表明，ReDi提高了模型推断的效率，加速了2倍。此外，ReDi在零样本跨域图像生成（如图像风格化）中具有良好的泛化能力。",
