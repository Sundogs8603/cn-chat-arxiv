    "translated_abstract": "分类学扩展是将大量其他节点（即“查询”）纳入现有分类学（即“种子”）的过程，其中最重要的步骤是选择每个查询的适当位置。虽然通过探索种子结构进行了大量努力，但现有方法在两方面挖掘结构信息存在不足：对层次语义的建模较差，无法捕捉is-a关系的方向性。本文试图通过将每个节点明确表示为继承特征（即结构部分）和增量特征（即补充部分）的组合来解决这些问题。具体而言，继承特征源自“父”节点，并加上一个继承因子的权重。有了这种节点表示法，分类学中的语义层次结构（即从“父级”到“子级”的继承和累积特征）可以被体现。此外，基于这些表示，可以捕捉节点之间is-a关系的方向，使模型能够区分不同方向的关系。提出了一种名为DNG（Directed Non-Gaussian）的算法，通过探索非高斯空间上的内在有向结构来扩展分类学。实验结果表明，DNG在效率和有效性方面均优于现有方法。",
