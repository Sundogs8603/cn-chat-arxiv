    "translated_abstract": "几何问题求解(GPS)是高级数学推理，需要多模态融合和几何知识应用的能力。最近，神经求解器在GPS方面表现出巨大潜力，但仍然在图表表现和模态融合方面存在不足。在这项工作中，我们将图表转化为基本文本子句，以有效描述图表特征，并提出了一种新的神经求解器PGPSNet，以高效地融合多模态信息。结合结构和语义预训练、数据增强和自我限制解码，PGPSNet拥有丰富的几何定理和几何表示知识，从而促进了几何理解和推理。此外，为了促进GPS的研究，我们构建了一个新的大规模精细注释的GPS数据集，名为PGPS9K，标有精细的图表注释和可解释的解决方案程序。在PGPS9K和现有数据集Geometry3K上的实验验证了PGPSNet的优越性。",
