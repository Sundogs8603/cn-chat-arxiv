    "abstract": "ChatGPT is a recent chatbot service released by OpenAI and is receiving increasing attention over the past few months. While evaluations of various aspects of ChatGPT have been done, its robustness, i.e., the performance to unexpected inputs, is still unclear to the public. Robustness is of particular concern in responsible AI, especially for safety-critical applications. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of the robustness of ChatGPT from the adversarial and out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective. To do so, we employ the AdvGLUE and ANLI benchmarks to assess adversarial robustness and the Flipkart review and DDXPlus medical diagnosis datasets for OOD evaluation. We select several popular foundation models as baselines. Results show that ChatGPT shows consistent advantages on most adversarial and OOD classification and translation tasks. However, the absolute performance is far from perfection, which suggests that adversarial and OOD robustness remains a significant threat ",

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT是OpenAI最近发布的聊天机器人服务，并在过去几个月中受到越来越多的关注。虽然已对ChatGPT的各个方面进行了评估，但其鲁棒性，即对于未预期输入的表现，仍不清楚。鲁棒性在负责任的AI中特别受关注，特别是对于安全关键应用程序。在本文中，我们从对抗性和超出分布（OOD）的角度对ChatGPT的鲁棒性进行了彻底评估。为此，我们采用了AdvGLUE和ANLI基准来评估对抗性鲁棒性，采用Flipkart评论和DDXPlus医学诊断数据集进行OOD评估。我们选择了几个流行的基础模型作为基准。结果表明，ChatGPT在大多数对抗性和OOD分类和翻译任务上表现出一致的优势。但是，绝对的表现远非完美，这表明对抗性和OOD鲁棒性仍然是一个重要的威胁。",
