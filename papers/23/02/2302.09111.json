    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑聚类可能具有非交换组并且其依赖关系可以通过已知的有向无环图来描述的分组数据的问题。为了允许在非交换组之间共享聚类，我们提出了一种贝叶斯非参数方法，称为图形化狄利克雷过程，它通过假设每个随机测度分布如同狄利克雷过程，其中浓度参数和基本概率测度取决于其父组的浓度参数和基本概率测度，来共同对依赖于组的特定随机测度进行建模。所得到的联合随机过程尊重连接组的有向无环图的马尔可夫性质。我们使用新方法的超图表示以及断棍法表示、餐馆类型表示和作为有限混合模型极限的表示来描述图形化狄利克雷过程。我们开发了一个高效的后验推断算法，并用模拟和实例说明了我们的模型。",
