    "translated_abstract": "随着越来越多基于AI的系统增加，OOD检测是一个迅速发展的领域，由于新的鲁棒性和安全性要求。现有的OOD文本检测器通常依赖于在编码器的最后一层输出上计算的异常得分（例如马氏距离）。在这项工作中，我们观察到OOD检测性能因任务和层输出而异。更重要的是，我们表明通常的选择（最后一层）很少是OOD检测的最佳选择，如果选择最佳层，则可以获得更好的结果。为了利用这个观察结果，我们提出了一种数据驱动的无监督方法来结合逐层的异常得分。此外，我们通过包括更多类别的分类任务（高达77）扩展了经典文本OOD基准测试，从而反映更现实的设置。在这个增强的基准测试上，我们展示了所提出的后聚合方法实现了鲁棒的OOD检测性能。",
