    "translated_abstract": "智能代理的关键能力之一是在没有外部监督的情况下发现有用的技能。然而，目前的无监督技能发现方法往往只能获得简单、易学的技能，因为缺乏发现更复杂、有挑战性行为的动机。我们引入了一种新的无监督技能发现方法，可控性感知技能发现（CSD），它可以在没有监督的情况下主动寻找复杂、难以控制的技能。CSD的关键组成部分是可控性感知距离函数，它给当前技能实现更难的状态转换分配更大的值。与距离最大化的技能发现结合起来，CSD在训练过程中逐步学习更具挑战性的技能，因为我们联合训练的距离函数降低了简单易实现技能的奖励。我们在六个机器人操作和运动环境中的实验结果表明，CSD可以发现各种不同的复杂技能，胜过现有的无监督技能发现方法。",
