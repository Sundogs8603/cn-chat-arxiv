    "translated_abstract": "人类通过从句子中提取信息（意义），将其与已有的常识知识结合，并进行推理来理解语言。虽然像GPT-3和ChatGPT这样的大型语言模型可以利用文本中的模式来解决各种自然语言处理任务，但在需要推理的问题上表现不佳。它们也无法可靠地解释生成的答案。为了更好地模拟人类，我们提出了STAR框架，将LLMs与Answer Set Programming (ASP) 结合起来。我们展示了如何使用LLMs有效地从语言中提取以谓词表示的知识。然后使用目标导向的ASP来可靠地进行推理。我们将STAR框架应用于需要推理的三个不同自然语言理解任务：定性推理，数学推理和目标导向对话。我们的实验表明，STAR能够填补自然语言理解任务中的推理差距，提供可靠的结果。",
