This paper explores stigma toward PWUS using a data set of roughly 5,000 public Reddit posts. We performed a crowd-sourced annotation task where workers are asked to annotate each post for the presence of stigma toward PWUS and answer a series of questions related to their experiences with substance use. Results show that workers who use substances or know someone with a substance use disorder are more likely to rate a post as stigmatizing. Building on this, we use a supervised machine learning framework that centers workers with lived substance use experience to ",

    "translated_abstract": "对使用物质的人（PWUS）的污名化是寻求治疗的主要障碍。此外，如果他们遭受更高水平的污名化，接受治疗的人更有可能中途退出。尽管与憎恨言论和有毒性有关的概念已经成为自动内容监管研究的重点，包括那些针对弱势群体的内容，但污名化，特别是对使用物质的人的污名化尚未得到关注。本文利用大约5000个公开的Reddit帖子数据集来探讨对PWUS的污名化。我们进行了一个众包注释任务，要求工人注释每个帖子是否存在对PWUS的污名化，并回答与他们对物质使用经验相关的一系列问题。结果显示，使用物质或认识有物质使用障碍的工人更有可能将帖子评为具有污名化。基于此，我们使用一个有监督的机器学习框架，以亲身物质使用经验的工人为中心进行建模。",

The findings suggest that workers with personal substance use experience are more likely to identify posts as stigmatizing, leading to the development of a machine learning framework centered around these workers' lived experiences."
