We then establish a comprehensive benchmark of 20 state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on 12 real-world datasets in vision, language, and healthcare domains. With results obtained from training over 10,000 models, we reveal intriguing observations for future progress in this space. First, existing algorithms only improve subgroup robustness over certain types of shifts but not others. Moreover, while current algorithms rely on group-annotated validation data for model selection, we find that a simple selection criterion based on worst-class accuracy is surprisingly",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型通常在训练数据中代表性不足的子群体上表现不佳。然而，对于导致子群体转变的机制以及算法在如此不同的转变中如何进行普遍化，我们知之甚少。在这项工作中，我们对子群体转变进行了细致的分析。首先，我们提出了一个统一的框架来剖析和解释子群体中的常见转变。然后，我们在视觉、语言和医疗领域的12个真实数据集上对20个最先进的算法进行了全面的基准测试。通过训练10,000多个模型得到的结果，我们揭示了未来在这个领域取得进展的有趣观察结果。首先，现有算法仅能在某些类型的转变上提高子群体的鲁棒性，而在其他类型的转变上则不能。此外，虽然当前算法依赖于群体标注的验证数据进行模型选择，但我们发现基于最差类别准确度的简单选择标准其实非常有效。",
