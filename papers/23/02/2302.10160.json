    "abstract": "We develop and analyze a principled approach to kernel ridge regression under covariate shift. The goal is to learn a regression function with small mean squared error over a target distribution, based on unlabeled data from there and labeled data that may have a different feature distribution. We propose to split the labeled data into two subsets and conduct kernel ridge regression on them separately to obtain a collection of candidate models and an imputation model. We use the latter to fill the missing labels and then select the best candidate model accordingly. Our non-asymptotic excess risk bounds show that in quite general scenarios, our estimator adapts to the structure of the target distribution as well as the covariate shift. It achieves the minimax optimal error rate up to a logarithmic factor. The use of pseudo-labels in model selection does not have major negative impacts.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出并分析了一种基于协变量转移的核岭回归方法。我们的目标是在目标分布上学习一个均方误差最小的回归函数，基于从目标分布采样的未标记数据和可能具有不同特征分布的已标记数据。我们将已标记数据分成两个子集，并分别进行核岭回归，以获得候选模型集合和一个填充模型。我们使用后者填充缺失的标签，然后相应地选择最佳的候选模型。我们的非渐近性过量风险界表明，在相当一般的情况下，我们的估计器能够适应目标分布以及协变量转移的结构。它能够实现渐近正态误差率直到对数因子的最小极限优化。在模型选择中使用伪标签不会产生主要负面影响。",
