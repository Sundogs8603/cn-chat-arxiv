Previous studies have used the smoothness of the temporal differences of such graph signals as an initial assumption.

In this work, we relax the requirement of this hypothesis by including a learning module. We propose a Time Graph Neural Network (TimeGNN) for the recovery of time-varying graph signals.

    "translated_abstract": "时变图信号的恢复是传感器网络和时间序列预测中具有广泛应用的一个基本问题。有效地捕捉这些信号的时空信息对下游任务至关重要。以前的研究使用这些图信号时间差分的平滑性作为一个初始假设。然而，当该先验不成立时，这种平滑性假设可能导致性能下降。在本工作中，我们通过包含一个学习模块来放松这个假设的需求。我们提出了一种用于恢复时变图信号的时间图神经网络(TimeGNN)。我们的算法使用编码器-解码器架构，并采用由均方误差函数和Sobolev平滑算子组成的专门损失。TimeGNN在真实数据集上显示出与以前方法竞争的性能。",
