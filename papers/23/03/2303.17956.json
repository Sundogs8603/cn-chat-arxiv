    "translated_abstract": "在医学图像领域，语义分割是由医生执行的最重要、最困难和最耗时的任务之一。由于计算机视觉中深度学习模型的最近进展，自动化这种任务的承诺变得越来越现实。然而，仍然需要解决许多问题，例如数据的稀缺可用性以及高度专业化模型的效率难以扩展到一般场景。放射治疗计划的风险器官分割属于此类问题，因为有限的数据可用性会对开发通用模型的可能性产生负面影响。在这项工作中，我们专注于通过提出三种类型的单器官模型集成来解决这个问题，这些模型能够利用其组件的不同专业技能产生多器官掩模。所获得的结果是令人兴奋的，并证明了这是一种可能的解决方案，可找到有效的方法在CT系列中执行多器官分割。",
