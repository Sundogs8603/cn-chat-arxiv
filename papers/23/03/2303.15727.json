    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLM)在多项自然语言理解任务中具有成功的应用，可能对基于自然语言处理(NLP)的心理健康应用研究也很有帮助。本研究报告了基于LLM的ChatGPT (使用gpt-3.5-turbo后端)在三个文本类心理健康分类任务中的表现: 压力检测 (2类分类)、抑郁症检测(2类分类)和自杀风险检测(5类分类)。我们从公共数据集中获取了三个分类任务的带标注社交媒体帖子。然后使用ChatGPT API对社交媒体帖子进行输入提示分类。我们得到了0.73、0.86和0.37的F1分数，分别用于压力检测、抑郁症检测和自杀风险检测。总体上，ChatGPT在语言处理领域中具备很大的应用前景。",
