    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了用Riemannian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo（RHMC）采样由$\\R^n$中$m$个不等式定义的多面体的方法。其中的度量按具有凸障碍函数的海森矩阵定义。RHMC相对于欧几里得方法（如球行走，hit-and-run和Dikin行走）的优势在于能够迈出更长的步伐。然而，在先前所有的工作中，混合速度都与不等式数量成线性关系。我们介绍了一个Lewis权重障碍和标准对数障碍的混合，并证明了相应RHMC的混合速度由$\\tilde O(m^{1/3}n^{4/3})$界限，改进了先前的最佳界限$\\tilde O(mn^{2/3})$（基于对数障碍）。这继续了最优化和采样之间的一般相似之处，后者通常导致新工具和更精细的分析。为了证明我们的主要结果，我们必须克服涉及Hamiltonian曲线的平滑性和自共轭性的几个挑战。",
