    "abstract": "Objective: To develop a natural language processing system that solves both clinical concept extraction and relation extraction in a unified prompt-based machine reading comprehension (MRC) architecture with good generalizability for cross-institution applications.  Methods: We formulate both clinical concept extraction and relation extraction using a unified prompt-based MRC architecture and explore state-of-the-art transformer models. We compare our MRC models with existing deep learning models for concept extraction and end-to-end relation extraction using two benchmark datasets developed by the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) challenge (medications and adverse drug events) and the 2022 n2c2 challenge (relations of social determinants of health [SDoH]). We also evaluate the transfer learning ability of the proposed MRC models in a cross-institution setting. We perform error analyses and examine how different prompting strategies affect the performance of MRC models.  Re",
