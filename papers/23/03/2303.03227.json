    "translated_abstract": "量子神经网络是一种新的机器学习范式，最近由于其潜在的优势而引起了很多关注。在特定条件下，这些模型用截断的傅里叶级数近似其数据集的分布。这种拟合的三角函数特性可能导致角度嵌入的量子神经网络在拟合给定数据集的非谐波特征时出现困难。此外，神经网络的可解释性仍然是一个挑战。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种新的可解释的混合量子神经网络类别，将数据集的输入同时传递给1）经典多层感知机和2）变分量子电路，然后将两者的输出进行线性组合。我们观察到量子神经网络在训练集上创建了一个平滑的正弦基础，然后经典感知机填补了该平台上非谐波的空白。我们在两个合成数据集上验证了这一观点。",
