    "abstract": "Transition risk can be defined as the business-risk related to the enactment of green policies, aimed at driving the society towards a sustainable and low-carbon economy. In particular, the value of certain firms' assets can be lower because they need to transition to a less carbon-intensive business model. In this paper we derive formulas for the pricing of defaultable coupon bonds and Credit Default Swaps to empirically demonstrate that a jump-diffusion credit risk model in which the downward jumps in the firm value are due to tighter green laws can capture, at least partially, the transition risk. The empirical investigation consists in the model calibration on the CDS term-structure, performing a quantile regression to assess the relationship between implied prices and a proxy of the transition risk. Additionally, we show that a model without jumps lacks this property, confirming the jump-like nature of the transition risk.",

    "translated_abstract": "转型风险定义为与实施旨在将社会引向可持续和低碳经济的绿色政策相关的业务风险。特别是，某些公司资产的价值可能会降低，因为它们需要转型为低碳经济。本文导出了违约付息债券和信用违约掉期的定价公式，以实证证明跳跃扩散信用风险模型能够部分地捕捉到由于严格的环保法规导致企业价值下降的转型风险。实证研究包括在CDS期限结构上进行模型校准，执行分位数回归以评估隐含价格与转型风险代理之间的关系。此外，我们还表明，没有跳跃的模型缺乏这种属性，从而确认了转型风险的跳跃特性。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种跳跃扩散信用风险模型，能够定价转型风险，即企业由于执行严格环保法规而面临的业务风险。基于CDS市场的实证研究表明该模型部分捕捉到了该种风险，而没有跳跃的模型则无法捕捉。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a jump-diffusion credit risk model to price transition risk, which refers to the business risk that companies face due to the enforcement of strict environmental regulations. Empirical evidence from the CDS market shows that the model partially captures this type of risk, while a model without jumps fails to do so."
