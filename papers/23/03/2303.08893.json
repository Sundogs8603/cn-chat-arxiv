    "translated_abstract": "基于投影的降阶模型已经成功地用少量广义（或潜在）变量来表示多尺度系统的行为，但是由于未解析尺度和已解析尺度之间的相互作用（称为封闭问题）的不正确处理，导致降阶模型可能存在不准确性和甚至不稳定性。本文将封闭问题视为多保真度问题，并使用多保真度深度算子网络（DeepONet）框架来解决。此外，为了增强基于多保真度的封闭问题的稳定性和/或准确性，本文还采用了物理和机器学习模型耦合文献中最近开发的“内循环”训练方法。最终方法在一维粘性Burgers方程的激波输运和二维Navier-Stokes方程的漩涡合并方面进行了测试。数值实验表明了显著的改进。",
