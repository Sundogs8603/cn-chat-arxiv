GAI is a pure-exploration bandit problem with the goal to output as many good arms using as few samples as possible, where a good arm is defined as an arm whose expected reward is greater than a given threshold. In this work, we propose DGAI - a differentiable good arm identification algorithm to improve the sample complexity of the state-of-the-art HDoC algorithm in a data-driven fashion. We also showed that the DGAI can further boost the performance of a general multi-arm bandit (MAB) problem given a threshold as a prior knowledge to the arm set. Extensive experiments confirm that our algorithm outperform the baseline algorithms significantly in both synthetic and real world datasets for both GAI and MAB tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对一种变体的随机多臂赌博问题，称之为好手臂识别（GAI）。 GAI是一个纯探索的赌博问题，其目标是在尽可能少的样本数下输出尽可能多的好手臂，其中好手臂被定义为其期望奖励大于给定阈值的手臂。 在这项工作中，我们提出DGAI-一种可微的好手臂识别算法，以数据驱动方式改进了现有技术HDoC算法的样本复杂性。 我们还展示了DGAI可以进一步提升通用多臂赌博（MAB）问题的性能，给定一个阈值作为先验知识应用于手臂集。 大量实验证实，我们的算法在合成数据集和真实世界数据集中的GAI和MAB任务中显著优于基线算法。",
