    "abstract": "Objectives: We aim to quantify longitudinal acute kidney injury (AKI) trajectories and to describe transitions through progressing and recovery states and outcomes among hospitalized patients using multistate models. Methods: In this large, longitudinal cohort study, 138,449 adult patients admitted to a quaternary care hospital between 2012 and 2019 were staged based on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes serum creatinine criteria for the first 14 days of their hospital stay. We fit multistate models to estimate probability of being in a certain clinical state at a given time after entering each one of the AKI stages. We investigated the effects of selected variables on transition rates via Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results: Twenty percent of hospitalized encounters (49,325/246,964) had AKI; among patients with AKI, 66% had Stage 1 AKI, 18% had Stage 2 AKI, and 17% had AKI Stage 3 with or without RRT. At seven days following Stage 1 AKI, 69% (95% confidence inte",

Conclusions: Patients hospitalized with AKI exhibit variable clinical trajectories; there is a substantial proportion of transitioning between AKI and non-AKI states during their hospital stay. Recovery from AKI is time-dependent and associated with the severity of the initial AKI stage. Multistate models may inform clinical decision making by predicting individual AKI trajectories and corresponding outcomes.\n",
