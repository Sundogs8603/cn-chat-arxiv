Accurate determination of the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutation status is highly relevant for the proper treatment of this patients. Purpose: The aim of this study was to predict the mutational status of the EGFR in non-small cell lung cancer patients using radiomics features extracted from PET-CT images. Methods: Retrospective study that involve 34 patients with lung cancer confirmed by histology and EGFR status mutation assessment. A total of 2.205 radiomics features were extracted from manual segmentation of the PET-CT images using pyradiomics library. Both computed tomography and positron emission tomography images were used. All images were acquired with intravenous iodinated contrast and F18-FDG. Preprocessing includes resampling, normalization, and discretization of the pixel intensity. Three methods were used for the feature selection process: backward selection (set 1), forward selection (set 2), and",
