    "abstract": "Explainable AI (XAI) has established itself as an important component of AI-driven interactive systems. With Augmented Reality (AR) becoming more integrated in daily lives, the role of XAI also becomes essential in AR because end-users will frequently interact with intelligent services. However, it is unclear how to design effective XAI experiences for AR. We propose XAIR, a design framework that addresses \"when\", \"what\", and \"how\" to provide explanations of AI output in AR. The framework was based on a multi-disciplinary literature review of XAI and HCI research, a large-scale survey probing 500+ end-users' preferences for AR-based explanations, and three workshops with 12 experts collecting their insights about XAI design in AR. XAIR's utility and effectiveness was verified via a study with 10 designers and another study with 12 end-users. XAIR can provide guidelines for designers, inspiring them to identify new design opportunities and achieve effective XAI designs in AR.",

    "translated_abstract": "可解释的人工智能（XAI）已经成为AI驱动交互式系统的重要组成部分。随着增强现实（AR）越来越多地融入日常生活，XAI在AR中的作用也变得至关重要，因为最终用户将经常与智能服务互动。然而，如何设计有效的AR XAI体验尚不清楚。我们提出了XAIR，这是一个设计框架，解决了何时，什么和如何在AR中提供AI输出解释的问题。该框架是基于对XAI和HCI研究的跨学科文献综述、对500多名最终用户对基于AR的解释偏好的大规模调查以及对12位专家收集他们在AR XAI设计方面的见解的三个研讨会而构建的。通过与10名设计师和另外12名最终用户进行的研究验证了XAIR的效用和有效性。XAIR可以为设计师提供指南，激发他们发现新的设计机会，并在AR中实现有效的XAI设计。",
