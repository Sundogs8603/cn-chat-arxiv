Using the mathematical theory of measurement and the physical theory of dimensional analysis, this book provides a coherent theory of value based on an equivalence relation not at the level of exchange, but of production. Indeed exchange is considered here as an equivalence relation between money and a monetary price, and not between commodities, modern monetary theory having demonstrated that money is not a commodity.

    "translated_abstract": "本书旨在从经济理论的奠基者亚当·斯密、戴维·李嘉图和卡尔·马克思提出的基本问题入手，探究商品的价值是由什么构成的，生产、交换、货币和收入（如利润、工资和租金）是什么样的。这些经济学家提供的答案大多是错误的，尤其是在将商品的等价定义为交换的水平上，但也由于将价值与价格混淆，并错误地看待生产的真正含义及固定资本的作用。本书运用度量的数学理论和维度分析的物理理论，基于一个不是在交换水平而是在生产水平上的等价关系，提供了一个一致的价值理论。本书拒绝将生产视为将投入转化为产出的过程，并从物质、能量和人类与自然、机器和其他人类进行交互的智力活动的物理角度对其进行重新定义。社会资本的再生产理论是基于恒定资本、可变资本和剩余价值的三分法，并确立价值守恒定律作为分配与价格理论的基石。利润理论表明，利润对应于物理可测量的量，因为在不确定性和风险的条件下，它是生产过程的物理结果。",
