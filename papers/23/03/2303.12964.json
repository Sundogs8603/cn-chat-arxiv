    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种称为CIPNN（Continuous Indeterminate Probability Neural Network）的通用模型，该模型基于IPNN，用于离散潜在随机变量。目前，连续潜在变量的后验被认为是不可计算的，但是IPNN提出了新的理论，可以解决这个问题。本文的贡献有四个方面。首先，我们推导了连续潜在随机变量的后验计算的解析解，并提出了一个通用分类模型（CIPNN）。其次，我们提出了一种通用的自编码器——CIPAE（Continuous Indeterminate Probability Auto-Encoder），其中解码器部分不是神经网络，而是第一次使用全概率推理模型。第三，我们提出了一种新的可视化潜在随机变量的方法。我们使用N维潜在变量之一作为解码器来重建输入图像，即使是分类任务也能达到效果，这样，我们可以看到每个潜在变量代表什么。第四，我们通过MNIST和Fashion-MNIST数据集的实验证明了所提出模型的有效性。",
