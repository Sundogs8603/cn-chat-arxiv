    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了在大部分输入空间是不可行（即违反约束条件）时，基于黑盒目标函数和从业者指定的目标偏好的约束多目标优化问题。这个问题在许多工程设计问题中都存在，包括模拟电路和电力系统设计。我们的总体目标是在可行的输入设计的小部分上近似最优Pareto集合。主要挑战包括设计空间的巨大大小、多个目标和大量的约束条件以及只能在进行昂贵的仿真后才能确认的可行的输入设计的小部分。我们提出了一种新颖而有效的偏好感知的约束多目标贝叶斯优化方法（PAC-MOO）来解决这些挑战。关键思想是学习输出目标和约束的代理模型，并根据从业者预测的偏好选择评估目标的候选输入。PAC-MOO根据预测的目标和约束的联合偏好迭代地选择下一个要模拟的输入设计，并使用新获得的数据更新代理模型。实验结果表明，与现有的最先进方法相比，所提出的方法具有有效性和效率。",
