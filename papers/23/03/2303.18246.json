    "translated_abstract": "图像估计人体姿态时往往会出现不合理的身体倾斜、浮动或穿透地板的情况。这样的方法忽视了身体通常由场景支撑的事实。物理引擎可以用来强制实现物理合理性，但这些引擎不可微分，依赖于不现实的代理物体，并且难以集成到现有的优化和学习框架中。相比之下，我们利用新颖的直觉物理（IP）术语，这些术语可以从一个与场景相互作用的3D SMPL身体中推断出来。受生物力学的启发，我们推断出身体上的压力热图、热图上的压力中心（CoP）以及SMPL身体的质心。借助这些，我们开发了IPMAN，通过鼓励合理的地板接触和重叠的CoP和CoM，在彩色图像中估计一个“稳定”的3D身体。我们的IP术语直观易懂，易于实现，计算速度快，可微分，并且可以集成到现有的优化和回归模型中。",
