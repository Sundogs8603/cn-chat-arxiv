    "translated_abstract": "数字平台使用推荐功能促进买卖双方之间的交流。平台参与者期望和立法者越来越要求，包括推荐在内的竞争必须是公平的，特别是对于市场主宰的平台可能出现的自我优先情况。然而，在平台上测试公平竞争具有挑战性，因为来自竞争平台参与者的报价通常在其属性上有所不同，并且存在许多不同的公平定义。本文考虑了这些挑战，发展了一种通过数字平台上的推荐度量公平竞争的五步方法，并通过进行两项实证研究来说明该方法。这些研究检查了亚马逊市场上亚马逊搜索引擎的推荐，利用三个国家超过一百万个每日观测值。他们发现没有一致的证据表明通过搜索引擎推荐存在不公平竞争。本文还讨论了一些政策含义和未来研究的可能性。",
