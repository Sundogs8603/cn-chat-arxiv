    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习是近年来深度多视角聚类方法中的核心组成部分。然而，我们发现基于自监督学习的深度多视角聚类方法在发展方面存在巨大差异，这可能会拖慢该领域的进展。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一个统一的框架DeepMVC，用于深度多视角聚类，其中包括许多最近的方法。我们利用我们的框架对自监督学习的影响进行关键观察，特别是对使用对比学习来对齐表示的缺点的观察。此外，我们证明了对比对齐可能会对聚类可分性产生负面影响，并且当视角的数量增加时，这种影响会变得更加严重。受到我们的发现的启示，我们开发了几种新的DeepMVC实例，具有新形式的自监督学习。我们进行了广泛的实验，并发现（i）与我们的理论发现一致，对比对齐会降低具有许多视角的数据集的性能；（ii）所有方法都受益于一定程度的自监督学习。",
