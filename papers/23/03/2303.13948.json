We first review the opportunities of knowledge graphs in terms of two aspects: (1) AI systems built upon knowledge graphs; (2) potential application fields of knowledge graphs.

    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能（AI）和大数据的爆炸式增长，适当地组织和代表海量知识变得至关重要。作为图形数据，知识图谱积累和传达了真实世界的知识。已经广为人知，知识图谱有效地代表了复杂的信息，因此近年来很快引起了学术界和工业界的关注。因此，为了更深入地了解知识图谱，本文对该领域进行了系统的概述。具体而言，我们关注知识图谱的机遇与挑战。我们首先从两个方面回顾了知识图谱的机会：（1）建立在知识图谱基础上的AI系统；（2）知识图谱的潜在应用领域。然后，我们详细讨论了该领域中的严峻技术挑战，如知识图谱嵌入、知识获取、知识图谱补全、知识融合和知识推理。",
