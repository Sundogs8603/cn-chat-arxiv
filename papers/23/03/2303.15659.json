    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种解决任意地形Toth盆地地下水流方程的新方法——使用深度学习进行边界-解映射。作者使用DeepONet生成边界-解映射，以此代替传统的数值求解器，该映射将物理域的几何形状和边界条件作为输入，输出稳态地下水流方程的解。作者通过截断傅里叶级数或分段线性表示来近似顶部和底部边界，并呈现了两个不同的DeepONet实现：一个将Toth盆地嵌入矩形计算域，另一个则通过非线性变换将具有任意顶部和底部边界的Toth盆地映射到矩形计算域中。作者针对顶部的Dirichlet和Robin边界条件以及底部的Neumann边界条件分别实现了DeepONet。",
