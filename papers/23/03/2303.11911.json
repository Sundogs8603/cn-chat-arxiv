    "abstract": "Various contrastive learning approaches have been proposed in recent years and achieve significant empirical success. While effective and prevalent, contrastive learning has been less explored for time series data. A key component of contrastive learning is to select appropriate augmentations imposing some priors to construct feasible positive samples, such that an encoder can be trained to learn robust and discriminative representations. Unlike image and language domains where ``desired'' augmented samples can be generated with the rule of thumb guided by prefabricated human priors, the ad-hoc manual selection of time series augmentations is hindered by their diverse and human-unrecognizable temporal structures. How to find the desired augmentations of time series data that are meaningful for given contrastive learning tasks and datasets remains an open question.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，许多对比学习方法已被提出并取得了显著的实证成果。虽然有效且普遍，但对于时间序列数据，对比学习的探索较少。对比学习的关键组成部分是选择适当的数据增强方式，引入一些先验信息来构造可行的正样本，从而训练编码器学习强大而具有区分度的表示。与图像和语言领域可以通过人类先验知识生成期望的增强样本不同，由于时间序列增强样本具有多样的、人类难以识别的时间结构，如何找到对于给定对比学习任务和数据集有意义的时间序列增强方式仍是一个开放的问题。本文通过鼓励基于信息感知的数据增强，同时保证高保真度和多样性来解决这个问题。",
