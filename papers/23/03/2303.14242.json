While IG-based approaches attain state-of-the-art performance, they often integrate noise into their explanation saliency maps, which reduce their interpretability. To minimize the noise, we examine the source of the noise analytically and propose a new approach to reduce the explanation noise based on our analytical findings. We propose the Important Direction Gradient Integration (IDGI) framework, which can be easily incorporated into any IG-based method that uses the Reimann Integration for integrated gradient computation. Extensive experiments with three IG-based methods show that IDGI improves them drastically on numerous interpretability metrics.",

    "translated_abstract": "Integrated Gradients（IG）及其变体是解释深度神经网络决策的众所周知的技术。虽然基于IG的方法具有最先进的性能，但它们经常将噪声集成到其解释显著性图中，从而降低其可解释性。为了最小化噪声，我们通过分析找出了噪声的来源，并提出了一种新的方法来减少解释噪声。我们提出了重要方向梯度集成（IDGI）框架，它可以很容易地集成到任何使用Reimann积分计算集成梯度的基于IG的方法中。三种基于IG的方法的大量实验证明，IDGI在众多可解释性指标上显著提高了它们的性能。",
