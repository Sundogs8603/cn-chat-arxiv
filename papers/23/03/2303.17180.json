    "abstract": "When land becomes more connected, its value can change because of network externalities. This idea is intuitive and appealing to developers and policymakers, but documenting their importance is empirically challenging because it is difficult to isolate the determinants of land value in practice. We address this challenge with real estate in The Sandbox, a virtual economy built on blockchain, which provides a series of natural experiments that can be used to estimate the causal impact of land-based of network externalities. Our results show that when new land becomes available, the network value of existing land increases, but there is a trade-off as new land also competes with existing supply. Our work illustrates the benefits of using virtual worlds to conduct policy experiments.",

    "translated_abstract": "当土地变得更加连接时，由于网络外部性，其价值可能会发生变化。这种想法对于开发人员和政策制定者来说直观而有吸引力，但是在实践中难以分离土地价值的决定因素，这是数据挖掘的一个难点。我们使用基于区块链的虚拟经济——The Sandbox中的房地产，应用一系列自然实验来估计基于网络外部性的土地的因果影响，从而解决了这个挑战。我们的研究结果表明，当新土地可用时，现有土地的网络价值会增加，但是要权衡新土地与现有供应的竞争关系。我们的工作展示了使用虚拟世界进行政策实验的好处。",
