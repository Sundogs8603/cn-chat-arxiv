    "translated_abstract": "本文重新审视了计算机视觉中用于视觉识别任务的标准预训练-微调范式。通常情况下，最先进的基础模型使用数十亿张图像的大规模（弱）监督数据集进行预训练。我们引入了一个额外的预前置训练阶段，它使用了自我监督的MAE技术来初始化模型。虽然MAE技术仅被证明能够与模型大小相缩放，但我们发现它也可以随数据集大小缩放。因此，我们基于MAE的预前置训练可同时适用于训练基础模型的模型和数据规模。预前置训练在一系列模型规模（参数数百万到数十亿）和数据集大小（图像数百万到数十亿）上一致提高了模型收敛性和下游转移性能，且我们还测量了其在10个不同的视觉识别任务上的有效性，包括图像分类、视频识别和目标检测。",
