Existing provable PnP methods impose heavy restrictions on the denoiser or fidelity function, such as nonexpansiveness or strict convexity. In this work, we propose a provable PnP method that imposes relatively light conditions based on proximal denoisers, and introduce a quasi-Newton step to greatly accelerate convergence.

    "translated_abstract": "即插即用（PnP）方法是一类高效的迭代算法，旨在利用经典优化算法（如ISTA或ADMM），将数据保真度项和深度去噪器相结合。现有的可证明的PnP方法对去噪器或保真度函数施加了严格的限制，如非扩张性或严格凸性。本文提出了一种可证明的PnP方法，该方法基于近端去噪器施加相对较轻的条件，并引入了拟牛顿步骤以大大加速收敛。通过将深度去噪器特别参数化为梯度步骤，我们进一步将拟牛顿PnP算法的固定点表征为可能非凸函数的临界点。",
