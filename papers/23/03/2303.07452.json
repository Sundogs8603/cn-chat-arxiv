    "translated_abstract": "由于网络流量的真实性和异构性，检测异常事件非常具有挑战性。全局服务器上的计算负荷在效率、准确性和可扩展性方面是一个重要的挑战。本文的主要动机是介绍一个强大且可扩展的框架，以实现高效的网络异常检测。我们利用联邦学习来解决网络异常检测的可扩展性和高效性问题，多个参与者联合训练一个全局模型。与集中式训练架构不同，联邦学习不需要参与者将他们的训练数据上传到服务器，从而防止攻击者利用训练数据。此外，大多数先前的工作都集中于传统的集中式机器学习，联合机器学习在网络异常检测领域的研究尚不充分。因此，我们提出了一个深度神经网络框架，可以在低端到中端设备上检测网络异常并保护隐私。我们在公开数据集上评估了我们的框架，证明了我们的方法可以在保护隐私的同时实现最先进的准确性。",
