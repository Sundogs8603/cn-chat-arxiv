We address this by introducing three data augmentation strategies, and leveraging them in (i) a decoupling module that aims to robustify the network to variations in the object's surroundings, and (ii) a de-positioning module that encourages the network to discard positional object information. We demonstrate the benefits of our method on COCO and on a new challenging benchmark, OpenImage-MINI, for object classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection.

    "translated_abstract": "密集自监督学习方法解决了处理具有多个物体的图像时使用图像级特征表示的限制。虽然利用分割映射和边界框提取的密集特征允许网络对每个物体执行自监督学习，但我们证明它们会受到耦合和位置偏差的影响。这是由于感受野随着层深度和零填充而增加所导致的。为解决这个问题，我们引入了三种数据增强策略，并在解耦模块和去定位模块中利用它们。我们的方法在COCO和一个新的具有挑战性的基准OpenImage-MINI上进行了实验，用于目标分类、语义分割和目标检测。我们广泛的实验证明了我们的方法相比SOT具有更好的泛化性能。",

The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms SOT in tasks such as object classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection on both COCO and a new benchmark called OpenImage-MINI."
