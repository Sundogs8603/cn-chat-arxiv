    "translated_abstract": "受最近有关新银行监管标准巴塞尔协议III宏观经济影响的争论的启发，本研究旨在找出巴塞尔银行监管委员会（BCBS，2010a）提出的巴塞尔III流动性和资本要求对孟加拉国的影响。使用22家在孟加拉国运营的私营商业银行2010-2014年的样本，利用少量宏观变量估计变量之间的长期关系。宏观经济变量包括银行的盈利能力、GDP、银行向私人部门的借贷、净稳定资金比率、一级资本比率、利差和实际利率。使用Driscoll和Kraay面板数据模型以固定效应进行定量成本估算。更高的资本和流动性要求对银行的稳定性的影响被认为是收益，而对银行利差和向私人部门贷款的影响被视为整个经济的成本。",

Through panel data analysis, it was found that higher capital and liquidity requirements have benefits for the stability of banks, while the impact on banks' interest rate spread and lending to private sector are considered as costs for the economy."
