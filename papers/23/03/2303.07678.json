    "abstract": "This paper introduces a simple yet effective query expansion approach, denoted as query2doc, to improve both sparse and dense retrieval systems. The proposed method first generates pseudo-documents by few-shot prompting large language models (LLMs), and then expands the query with generated pseudo-documents. LLMs are trained on web-scale text corpora and are adept at knowledge memorization. The pseudo-documents from LLMs often contain highly relevant information that can aid in query disambiguation and guide the retrievers. Experimental results demonstrate that query2doc boosts the performance of BM25 by 3% to 15% on ad-hoc IR datasets, such as MS-MARCO and TREC DL, without any model fine-tuning. Furthermore, our method also benefits state-of-the-art dense retrievers in terms of both in-domain and out-of-domain results.",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文介绍了一种简单但有效的查询扩展方法，称为query2doc，可改善稀疏和密集检索系统。该方法首先利用小批量提示大型语言模型生成伪文档，然后使用生成的伪文档扩展查询。大型语言模型经过训练，能够记忆知识，从而生成的伪文档通常包含高度相关的信息，有助于查询消岐和指导检索器。实验结果表明，在不进行任何模型微调的情况下，query2doc 在 MS-MARCO 和 TREC DL 等 ad-hoc IR 数据集上将 BM25 的性能提高了 3% 到 15%。此外，我们的方法还在领域内和领域外的结果方面受益于最先进的密集检索器。",
