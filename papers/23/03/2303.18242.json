    "abstract": "We introduce $\\infty$-Diff, a generative diffusion model which directly operates on infinite resolution data. By randomly sampling subsets of coordinates during training and learning to denoise the content at those coordinates, a continuous function is learned that allows sampling at arbitrary resolutions. In contrast to other recent infinite resolution generative models, our approach operates directly on the raw data, not requiring latent vector compression for context, using hypernetworks, nor relying on discrete components. As such, our approach achieves significantly higher sample quality, as evidenced by lower FID scores, as well as being able to effectively scale to higher resolutions than the training data while retaining detail.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种名为$\\infty$-Diff的生成式扩散模型，可以处理无限分辨率的数据。通过在训练期间随机抽样数据的子集并学习去噪，我们可以学到一个连续的函数，允许任意分辨率的采样。与其他最近的无限分辨率生成式模型相比，我们的方法直接操作原始数据，不需要使用超网络进行潜在向量压缩或依赖于离散的组件。因此，我们的方法可以显著提高样本质量，例如降低FID分数，并能够在保留细节的同时有效地扩展到比训练数据更高的分辨率。",
