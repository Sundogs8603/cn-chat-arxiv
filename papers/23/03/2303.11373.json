    "abstract": "Object rearrangement is a challenge for embodied agents because solving these tasks requires generalizing across a combinatorially large set of configurations of entities and their locations. Worse, the representations of these entities are unknown and must be inferred from sensory percepts. We present a hierarchical abstraction approach to uncover these underlying entities and achieve combinatorial generalization from unstructured visual inputs. By constructing a factorized transition graph over clusters of entity representations inferred from pixels, we show how to learn a correspondence between intervening on states of entities in the agent's model and acting on objects in the environment. We use this correspondence to develop a method for control that generalizes to different numbers and configurations of objects, which outperforms current offline deep RL methods when evaluated on simulated rearrangement tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于具有实体机器人智能的问题而言，物体重新排列任务是一个巨大挑战，因为解决这些任务需要泛化到极大组合的实体状态。更糟糕的是，这些实体的表示是未知的，必须从感官输入进行推断。我们提出了一种层次抽象的方法，以揭示这些底层实体，并从非结构化视觉输入中实现组合泛化。通过在像素聚类上构建一个因子化的转换图，我们展示了如何学习代理模型中实体状态和环境物体之间的对应关系。我们利用这种关系开发了一种控制方法，可泛化到不同数量和配置的物体，当在模拟重新排列任务上进行评估时，该方法胜过当前的离线深度强化学习方法。",
