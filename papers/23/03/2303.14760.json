    "translated_abstract": "密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的数值精度取决于各种计算参数，其中最关键的之一是基组大小。理论上，使用无限大的基组，即完备基组集，可以达到最高精度。我们的目标是找到一种机器学习模型，将有限基组大小计算外推到完备基组极限。我们从63个二元固体的数据集开始，这些固体使用两种全电子DFT代码，即exciting和FHI-aims，这两种代码使用非常不同类型的基组。使用分位随机森林模型来估计基组大小关于全收敛计算的总能量修正。该随机森林模型对于两种代码都实现了小于25%的对称平均绝对百分比误差，而且胜过了文献中之前的方法。我们的方法还提供了预测区间，可以量化模型的不确定性。",
