    "translated_abstract": "找到导致当前宇宙状态的初始条件是具有挑战性的，因为它涉及到搜索一个巨大的初始条件输入空间，并通过诸如N-体模拟等工具建模它们的演化，这是计算上昂贵的。深度学习已经成为一种替代建模工具，它可以学习N-体模拟的线性输入与红移为零时的最终非线性位移之间的映射，这可以显著加速向前的模拟。但是，这并不能减少初始条件的搜索空间。在本文中，我们首次证明了深度学习模型可以被用于反向映射。我们训练了一个基于V-Net的卷积神经网络，它可以在给定系统当前时间的非线性位移和宇宙学参数的情况下输出N-体系统的线性位移。我们证明了这个神经网络可以准确地恢复初始线性位移。",
