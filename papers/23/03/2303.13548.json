    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a demo of an intelligent personal agent called Hey Dona (or just Dona) with virtual voice assistance in student course registration. It is a deployed project in the theme of AI for education. In this digital age with a myriad of smart devices, users often delegate tasks to agents. While pointing and clicking supersedes the erstwhile command-typing, modern devices allow users to speak commands for agents to execute tasks, enhancing speed and convenience. In line with this progress, Dona is an intelligent agent catering to student needs by automated, voice-operated course registration, spanning a multitude of accents, entailing task planning optimization, with some language translation as needed. Dona accepts voice input by microphone (Bluetooth, wired microphone), converts human voice to computer understandable language, performs query processing as per user commands, connects with the Web to search for answers, models task dependencies, imbibes quality control",
