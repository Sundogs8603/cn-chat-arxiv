    "translated_abstract": "零样本开放式词汇检测的核心问题在于如何对齐视觉和文本特征，以使检测器在未见类上表现良好。之前的方法从头开始训练特征金字塔和检测头部，这破坏了预训练期间建立的视觉-文本特征对齐，并且难以防止语言模型忘记未见类。我们提出了三种方法来缓解这些问题。首先，使用简单的方案来增强文本嵌入，防止过度拟合到训练期间见到的少量类别，并同时节省内存和计算。其次，修改特征金字塔网络和检测头部，包括可训练门控快捷方式，这鼓励视觉-文本特征对齐，并确保在检测训练开始时实现特征对齐。最后，采用自学习方法利用更大的图像-文本对语料库，从而改善无人类注释类别的检测性能。",
