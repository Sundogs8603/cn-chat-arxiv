    "translated_abstract": "工作场所部署的感知技术可以收集个人活动和群体互动的详细数据，否则很难捕捉。这些技术的一个有希望的应用是它们可以帮助企业和工人优化生产力和福祉。然而，鉴于工作场所中的内在和结构性权力动态，接受含蓄的遵从以监测工作活动而不是寻求工人的有意义的同意的普遍做法引发了隐私和伦理方面的担忧。本文阐述了工人在同意工作场所健康科技方面面临的一系列挑战。利用一个虚拟案例，引导15位参与者参与了6个多利益相关方焦点小组，我们探讨了参与者同意工作场所感知技术的期望和能力。我们描绘了可能更好地支持更有意义的同意工作场所健康科技的干预措施，这些措施 drawing on critical",
