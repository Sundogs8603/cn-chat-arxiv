    "translated_abstract": "标签分布（LD）使用描述程度来描述实例，在处理标签模糊的情况下提供了更加细粒度的监督信息。然而，在许多实际应用中，LD是不可用的。为了获取LD，标签增强（LE）被提出来从逻辑标签中恢复LD。现有的LE方法存在以下问题：（i）它们使用逻辑标签来训练到LD的映射，但是监督信息太宽松，可能导致模型预测不准确；（ii）它们忽略了特征的冗余性，并直接使用收集的特征。为了解决（i），我们使用特征空间的拓扑结构生成更准确的标签置信度。为了解决（ii），我们提出了一种新的监督式LE降维方法，它将原始数据投影到较低维的特征空间中。将以上两种方法结合起来，我们获得了用于LE的增强数据。此外，我们还提出了一种基于变换学习的新型非线性LE模型，显著提高了标签增强的准确性。在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，我们提出的方法在准确性和效率方面优于现有的最先进方法。",
