    "translated_abstract": "在传统模糊C均值聚类算法中，由于隶属函数始终为正，当聚类大小差异巨大时，会导致不平衡的影响。即，一个明显更大的聚类将所有其他聚类坐标点吸引到其中心，无论它们有多远。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种基于隶属度函数线性和二次项的目标函数的混合模糊-清晰聚类算法。在该算法中，如果数据点距离聚类中心“足够”远，则将其隶属度精确地设置为零。本文介绍了一种新的混合模糊-清晰聚类算法及其几何解释。该算法在二十个模拟的数据集和五个来自UCI数据仓库的真实数据集上进行了测试，并与传统的模糊和清晰聚类方法进行了比较。实验结果表明，所提出的算法在聚类质量和鲁棒性方面优于传统方法。",

The algorithm outperforms conventional methods in clustering quality and robustness according to experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets from the UCI repository."
