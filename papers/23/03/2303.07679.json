    "translated_abstract": "预测图像记忆力已经吸引了各个领域的兴趣。因此，使用卷积神经网络（CNN）模型的预测精度已经接近基于人类一致性估计的经验上限。然而，确定嵌入在CNN模型中的哪些特征表示对于记忆力的高预测准确性负责仍然是个悬而未决的问题。为了解决这个问题，本研究尝试使用脑部相似性来识别CNN模型中与记忆力有关的特征表示。具体而言，通过Brain-Score评估了在64个用于物体识别的CNN模型的16,860层中高记忆力预测准确性和脑部相似性。这项全面的分析显示出一个明显的趋势，即具有高记忆力预测准确性的层与最高阶段的颞下皮质（IT）的脑部相似性更高。此外，对64个CNN模型进行微调以预测图像记忆力并没有进一步提高准确性，这意味着现有的CNN模型已经包含了与记忆力相关的特征表示。",
