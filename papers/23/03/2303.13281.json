    "abstract": "This study proposes an estimator that combines statistical identification with economically motivated restrictions on the interactions. The estimator is identified by (mean) independent non-Gaussian shocks and allows for incorporation of uncertain prior economic knowledge through an adaptive ridge penalty. The estimator shrinks towards economically motivated restrictions when the data is consistent with them and stops shrinkage when the data provides evidence against the restriction. The estimator is applied to analyze the interaction between the stock and oil market. The results suggest that what is usually identified as oil-specific demand shocks can actually be attributed to information shocks extracted from the stock market, which explain about 30-40% of the oil price variation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种估计器，它将统计识别与经济学动机相结合。估计值是由（均值）独立非高斯性冲击识别的，并通过自适应岭惩罚来考虑不确定的先验经济知识。当数据与经济学约束一致时，估计值向这些约束收缩；当数据提供反对证据时，收缩停止。本研究将该估计器应用于分析股票和石油市场之间的相互作用。结果表明，通常被认为是石油特定需求冲击的东西，实际上可以归因于从股票市场提取的信息冲击，其解释了约30-40%的油价变动。",
