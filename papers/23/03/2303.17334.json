    "translated_abstract": "随着移动通信技术（如5G）的快速发展，电信欺诈得到了显著增加，影响了个人财富和社会财富的损失。最近，图挖掘技术逐渐成为检测电信欺诈的主流解决方案。然而，由于帕累托原因引起的图不平衡问题给图数据挖掘带来了严重的挑战。这是一个新的和具有挑战性的问题，但之前很少有研究关注。本文提出了一种针对图不平衡问题的图注意力网络和成本敏感增强（GAT-COBO）方法。首先，我们设计了基于GAT的基本分类器来学习图中所有节点的嵌入。然后，将嵌入馈送到经过良好设计的成本敏感学习器中进行不平衡学习。接下来，根据分类错误成本更新权重，使模型更多地关注少数类。最终，我们将基于分类器和成本敏感学习器获得的节点嵌入相加，得出最终预测。实验结果表明，我们提出的GAT-COBO方法在与最先进的基准线相比时取得了令人满意的性能。",
