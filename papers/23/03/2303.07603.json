    "abstract": "Most US school districts draw \"attendance boundaries\" to define catchment areas that assign students to schools near their homes, often recapitulating neighborhood demographic segregation in schools. Focusing on elementary schools, we ask: how much might we reduce school segregation by redrawing attendance boundaries? Combining parent preference data with methods from combinatorial optimization, we simulate alternative boundaries for 98 US school districts serving over 3 million elementary-aged students, minimizing White/non-White segregation while mitigating changes to travel times and school sizes. Across districts, we observe a median 14% relative decrease in segregation, which we estimate would require approximately 20\\% of students to switch schools and, surprisingly, a slight reduction in travel times. We release a public dashboard depicting these alternative boundaries (https://www.schooldiversity.org/) and invite both school boards and their constituents to evaluate their viabi",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数美国学区制定“考勤边界”来定义分配学生到家附近学校的区域，往往重演邻里种族隔离在学校中的现象。本研究集中在小学上，并提出以下问题：重新划分考勤边界是否能够减少学校的种族隔离现象？我们将家长的偏好数据与组合优化方法相结合，模拟了覆盖超过3百万小学生的98个美国学区的替代边界，以最小化白/非白人种族分离，同时减轻对行程时间和学校规模的影响。在各个学区中，我们观察到中位数14%的种族隔离率相对降低，这需要约20%的学生转换学校，并出乎意料地略微缩短了行程时间。我们发布了一个公共仪表板（https://www.schooldiversity.org/），展示这些替代边界，并邀请学校董事会及其利益相关者进行评估。",
