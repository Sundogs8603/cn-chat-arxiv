    "abstract": "Chatbots have long been capable of answering basic questions and even responding to obscure prompts, but recently their improvements have been far more significant. Modern chatbots like Open AIs ChatGPT3 not only have the ability to answer basic questions but can write code and movie scripts and imitate well-known people. In this paper, we analyze ChatGPTs' responses to various questions from a dataset of queries from the popular Quora forum. We submitted sixty questions to ChatGPT and scored the answers based on three industry-standard metrics for grading machine translation: BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE. These metrics allow us to compare the machine responses with the most upvoted human answer to the same question to assess ChatGPT's ability to submit a humanistic reply. The results showed that while the responses and translation abilities of ChatGPT are remarkable, they still fall short of what a typical human reaction would be.",

    "translated_abstract": "聊天机器人能够回答基本问题，甚至回应奇怪的提示，但最近它们的改进显著提高。像OpenAI ChatGPT3这样的现代聊天机器人不仅能够回答基本问题，还能编写代码、电影剧本并模仿知名人物。在本文中，我们分析了ChatGPT对从流行Quora论坛的数据集中提出的各种问题的回答。我们向ChatGPT提交了60个问题，并根据三个行业标准评分机器翻译的度量标准(BLEU、METEOR和ROUGE)对答案进行评分。这些度量标准允许我们将机器的回复与同一问题的最多赞同的人类答案进行比较，以评估ChatGPT提交人性化回复的能力。结果显示，虽然ChatGPT的响应和翻译能力非常出色，但仍然达不到典型人类反应的水平。",
