We separate this challenging goal into two sub-tasks: (1) recognize and label the semantic entities that correspond to the components of the optimization problem; (2) generate a meaning representation (i.e., a logical form) of the problem from its detected problem entities. The first task aims to reduce ambiguity by detecting and tagging the entities of the optimization problems.

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言优化（NL4Opt）竞赛旨在研究如何根据优化问题的文本描述提取其含义和表述的方法。具体而言，该竞赛的目标是通过使用自然语言中介来使非专业人士能够接口使用优化求解器，以增加其可访问性和可用性。我们将这一挑战性目标分为两个子任务：(1)识别和标记对应于优化问题组件的语义实体;(2)从检测到的问题实体生成意义表示(即逻辑形式)。第一个任务旨在通过检测和标记优化问题的实体来减少歧义。第二个任务创建了一个线性规划(LP)问题的中间表示，该中间表示被转换为商用求解器可用的格式。在本报告中，我们介绍了LP单词问题数据集和NL4Opt比赛的共享任务，并总结了竞赛条目的结果。",
