Researchers studying classification have generally considered fairness to be a matter of achieving equality of outcomes between a protected and unprotected group, and built algorithmic interventions on this basis. We argue that fairness in real-world application settings in general, and especially in the context of personalized recommendation, is much more complex and multi-faceted, requiring a more general approach. We propose a model to formalize multistakeholder fairness in recommender systems as a two stage social choice problem. In particular, we express recommendation fairness as a novel combination of an allocation and an aggregation problem, which integrate both fairness concerns and personalized recommendation provisions, and derive new recommendation techniques",

    "translated_abstract": "在个性化推荐的算法公平性中，算法公平性面临与分类任务中常见挑战显著不同的问题。研究分类的研究人员通常认为公平性在于实现受保护组和未受保护组之间结果的平等，并基于此构建算法干预。我们认为，在现实世界的应用环境中通常更为复杂且多方面，在个性化推荐的背景下尤其如此，需要更一般化的方法。我们提出了一个模型，将推荐系统中的多利益相关者公平性形式化为两阶段社会选择问题。特别地，我们将推荐公平性表达为一个分配和聚合问题的新颖组合，将公平关注点和个性化推荐规定融合在一起，并推导出新的推荐技术。",
