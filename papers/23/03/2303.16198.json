    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的方法，通过Sentinel 2卫星测量欧洲地区的天气来建立植被对天气的响应模型。现有的卫星图像预测方法重点关注多光谱图像的真实感，而衍生的植被动态尚未得到太多关注。我们通过将气象指导应用于最先进的视频预测方法，扩展了空间和时间上下文。我们通过引入一个学习的云层掩模和适当的评估方案，扩展了EarthNet2021数据集以适合植被建模。定量和定性实验证明了我们的方法在包括领先的卫星图像预测方法在内的各种基线方法中具有卓越的性能。此外，我们展示了如何将我们建立的植被动态应用于下游任务：用于碳监测的总初级生产力的推断。据我们所知，这是第一次建立基于气象引导的视频预测模型。",
