    "translated_abstract": "通道剪枝可以有效地减少原始网络的计算成本和内存占用，同时保持相当的精度性能。虽然在2D基于图像的卷积神经网络（CNN）中已经取得了巨大的成功，但现有的工作很少将通道修剪方法扩展到3D基于点云的神经网络（PNNs）。直接将2D CNN通道修剪方法实现到PNN会破坏PNN性能，因为2D图像和3D点云的不同表示以及网络结构的差异。在本文中，我们提出了CP$^3$，它是一种基于点云网络的通道修剪插件。 CP$^3$经过精心设计，利用点云和PNN的特性，以使2D通道剪枝方法适用于PNN。具体而言，它提出了一个坐标增强的通道重要度指标，以反映尺寸信息和个体通道特征之间的相关性，从而实现通道剪枝的最优选择。",
