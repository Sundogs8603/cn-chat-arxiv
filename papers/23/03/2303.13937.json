    "abstract": "We present a new approach, the Topograph, which reconstructs underlying physics processes, including the intermediary particles, by leveraging underlying priors from the nature of particle physics decays and the flexibility of message passing graph neural networks. The Topograph not only solves the combinatoric assignment of observed final state objects, associating them to their original mother particles, but directly predicts the properties of intermediate particles in hard scatter processes and their subsequent decays. In comparison to standard combinatoric approaches or modern approaches using graph neural networks, which scale exponentially or quadratically, the complexity of Topographs scales linearly with the number of reconstructed objects.  We apply Topographs to top quark pair production in the all hadronic decay channel, where we outperform the standard approach and match the performance of the state-of-the-art machine learning technique.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的方法，称为Topograph，它利用粒子物理衰变的本质和信息传递图神经网络的灵活性，重建了包括中介粒子在内的底层物理过程。Topograph不仅解决了观测到的末态对象的组合指派问题，将它们与它们原来的母粒子关联起来，而且直接预测了硬散射过程中中间粒子的性质及其后续衰变。与标准的组合方法或现代图神经网络方法相比，它的复杂度与重构对象的数量成线性关系。我们应用Topograph于全强子衰变模式下的顶夸克对产生问题，相对标准方法，我们的方法表现更优，与最先进的机器学习技术相当。",
