    "translated_abstract": "椎体骨折是骨质疏松症的后果，对患者的健康有重要影响。然而，使用 CT 检查对其进行分级是困难和主观的，这促使着自动化分级方法的开发。然而，目前的方法受到数据不平衡和稀缺性以及缺乏可解释性的制约。为了解决这些挑战，本文提出了一种新方法，利用未标记数据训练生成式扩散自编码器 (DAE) 模型作为无监督特征提取器。我们将骨折分级建模为连续回归，这更能反映骨折的平稳进展。具体地，我们使用二元有监督的骨折分类器构建 DAE 的潜空间中的超平面。然后，我们将骨折的严重程度回归为距离超平面的函数，对结果进行 Genant 标度的校准。重要的是，我们方法的生成本质允许我们视觉化给定骨折的不同级别，并生成合成数据，我们使用该数据来增强训练集。我们在公开可用的腰椎 CT 扫描数据集上评估了我们的方法，证明相对于最先进的基线方法，我们有了显著的改进。",

Continuous regression is used to reflect the smooth progression of fractures. With the unsupervised feature extractor and data augmentation, the method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baseline methods."
