We construct ANNs to calibrate parameters for two well-known GARCH-type option pricing models: Duan's GARCH and the classical tempered stable GARCH that significantly improve upon the limitation of the Black-Scholes model but have suffered from computation complexity. To mitigate this technical difficulty, we train ANNs with a dataset generated by Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method and apply them to calibrate optimal parameters. The performance results indicate that the ANN approach consistently outperforms MCS and takes advantage of faster computation times once trained. The Greeks of options are also discussed.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了人工神经网络（ANN）作为无模型解决期权定价模型校准算法的方案。我们构建了ANN来校准两种着名的GARCH型期权定价模型的参数：Duan的GARCH和经典温和稳定GARCH，这两个模型显著改进了Black-Scholes模型的局限性，但受到计算复杂性的影响。为了减轻这种技术困难，我们使用蒙特卡洛模拟（MCS）方法生成的数据集对ANNS进行训练，并将其应用于校准最佳参数。性能结果表明，ANN方法始终优于MCS，并且一旦经过训练，还可以利用更快的计算时间。还讨论了期权的希腊字母。",
