    "translated_abstract": "机器学习技术已成功地应用于从粉末X射线衍射图中提取结构信息，如晶体空间群。然而，直接在ICSD等数据库的模拟衍射图上进行训练存在挑战，原因是其规模有限、类别不均匀并且偏向某些结构类型。我们提出了一种替代方法，即通过利用每个空间群的对称操作，在随机坐标下生成合成晶体。基于这种方法，我们演示了使用深度ResNet类模型进行在线训练，每小时最多可生成少量百万个唯一的合成衍射图。针对我们选择的空间群分类任务，在大多数空间群的未见ICSD结构类型上，我们实现了79.9%的测试准确性。这超过了直接在ICSD晶体上进行训练的当前最先进方法的56.1%准确性。我们的结果证明合成晶体数据集可用于通过神经网络提取ICSD粉末X射线衍射图中的结构信息。",
