    "translated_abstract": "多视角聚类（MvC）旨在探索多视图数据的类别结构，而无需标签监督。多视图比单视图提供更多信息，因此现有的MvC方法可以实现令人满意的性能。然而，在实际场景中，如果视图嘈杂，它们的性能可能会严重退化。在本文中，我们首先正式研究了嘈杂视图的缺点，随后提出了一个理论上基础的深度MvC方法（称为MvCAN）来解决这个问题。具体来说，我们提出了一个新颖的MvC目标，使得不共享参数和不一致的聚类预测可以跨越多个视图，以减少嘈杂视图的副作用。此外，设计了一种非参数迭代过程，以生成一个稳健的学习目标，以挖掘多个视图的有用信息。理论分析表明，MvCAN的工作是通过实现多视图一致性，互补性和噪声鲁棒性来实现的。最后，对公开基准数据集和新收集的实际数据集进行的实验证明，MvCAN在处理实际场景中的嘈杂视图方面优于现有的MvC方法。",
