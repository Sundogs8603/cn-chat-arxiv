    "translated_abstract": "图像分类的准确性和高效性取决于访问大型标记数据集并在模型训练的相同领域上测试数据。当处理来自不同领域的新数据时，分类变得更加具有挑战性，因为收集大型标记数据集并从头训练新分类器耗时、昂贵，有时是不可行或不可能的。跨域分类框架通过利用无监督图像对图像 (UI2I) 翻译模型将输入图像从未标记的域转换为标记域来处理这个数据域漂移问题。这些无监督模型的问题在于它们是无监督的。由于缺少注释，无法使用传统的监督度量来评估这些翻译模型以选择最佳的检查点模型。在本文中，我们介绍了一种新的方法，称为伪监督度量，专门用于评估无监督跨域分类框架中 UI2I 翻译模型的性能。我们通过对几个基准数据集的实验证明了我们的方法的有效性。",
