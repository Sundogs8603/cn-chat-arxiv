    "translated_abstract": "节点嵌入学习是图机器学习领域的一个关键研究领域。一个明确定义的节点嵌入模型应该在最终嵌入中反映出节点特征和图结构。在动态图的情况下，由于特征和结构随时间而变化，这个问题变得更加复杂。在图的演化过程中，某些节点的嵌入应该保持可比性，这可以通过应用对齐过程来实现。在现有的工作中，这一步经常是在节点嵌入已经计算出来后进行的。在本文中，我们介绍了一个框架--RAFEN，它允许使用上述对齐项来丰富任何现有的节点嵌入方法，并在训练过程中学习对齐节点嵌入。我们提出了几个变体的框架，并在六个真实数据集上展示了其性能。RAFEN 实现了与现有方法相当或更好的性能，而不需要额外的参数设置。",
