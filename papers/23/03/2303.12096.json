    "translated_abstract": "我们对Stefan Boettcher [arXiv:2210.00623]的评论做了全面回复，并认为这个评论仅针对一种非典型的问题，仅关注稀疏图上的最大割问题(MaxCut)，而贪心算法在这种问题上表现良好。相反，我们强调了我们原始工作背后更广泛的算法开发，并在我们原始框架内提供了额外的数值结果，表明我们的算法在原始数据上有显着改进，因此推翻了评论的原始性能陈述。此外，已经证明物理启发的图神经网络(PI-GNN)能够胜过贪心算法，特别是在困难的、密集的实例上。我们还指出，图神经网络的内部(并行)解剖与贪心算法的(顺序)本质有很大不同，基于它们在实际社交网络规模的使用情况，指出了图神经网络的优势。",
    "tldr": "回复评论，认为评论聚焦于一种非典型问题且过于简化，强调了原始工作背后更广泛的算法开发以及实验数据的改进，并且指出图神经网络的内部解剖与贪心算法的本质大不相同，因此具有优势。",
    "en_tdlr": "In response to a critical comment, this paper argues that the comment focused on a non-representative problem and oversimplified the matter. The authors highlight the broader algorithmic development and improved experimental results, and assert that the internal anatomy of graph neural networks provides a significant advantage over greedy algorithms."
