    "abstract": "The right response to someone who says \"get ready for a party\" is deeply influenced by meaning and context. For a smart home assistant (e.g., Google Home), the ideal response might be to survey the available devices in the home and change their state to create a festive atmosphere. Current practical systems cannot service such requests since they require the ability to (1) infer meaning behind an abstract statement and (2) map that inference to a concrete course of action appropriate for the context (e.g., changing the settings of specific devices). In this paper, we leverage the observation that recent task-agnostic large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 embody a vast amount of cross-domain, sometimes unpredictable contextual knowledge that existing rule-based home assistant systems lack, which can make them powerful tools for inferring user intent and generating appropriate context-dependent responses during smart home interactions. We first explore the feasibility of a system that ",

    "translated_abstract": "当有人说“准备好聚会”，正确的回答深受含义和上下文的影响。对于智能家居助手（例如Google Home），理想的回答可能是调查家中可用的设备，并改变它们的状态以营造欢乐的氛围。本文利用最近的任务无关的大语言模型（LLM），如GPT-3，它们具有广泛的跨领域、有时不可预测的上下文知识，这种知识现有的基于规则的家用助手系统缺乏，可以使它们成为推断用户意图并在智能家居交互期间生成适当的上下文依赖响应的强大工具。",
