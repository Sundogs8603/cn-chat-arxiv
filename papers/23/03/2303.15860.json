    "translated_abstract": "无线指纹识别是一种利用硬件不完善和无线信道变化作为标识的设备识别方法。除了物理层特征外，最近的研究表明可以通过网络流量（例如包长度）识别用户行为，而无需解密有效载荷。因此，我们提出了一个多层指纹识别框架，联合考虑多层特征以提高识别性能。与以前的工作不同，我们利用了最近的多视图机器学习范例，即多形式数据，可以在不需要监督的情况下聚合多层特征共享的设备信息。我们的信息论方法可以扩展到有监督和半监督设置，并通过直接推导获得简单的导出式。为了解决所制定的问题，我们使用变分推断获得紧密的代理界限，以进行有效的优化。在提取特征方面，我们使用Wyner变分自编码器来克服多视图数据分布间的分歧。",
