SoftZoo supports an extensive, naturally-inspired material set, including the ability to simulate environments such as flat ground, desert, wetland, clay, ice, snow, shallow water, and ocean.

    "translated_abstract": "虽然在控制方面已经取得了显著的研究进展，但在同时协同优化形态时出现了独特的挑战。现有的工作通常是为特定环境或表示量量身定制的。为了更充分地理解固有的设计和性能权衡，并加速开发新型软体机器人，需要一个包含已建立好的任务、环境和评估指标的全面虚拟平台。在这项工作中，我们介绍了SoftZoo，这是一个面向多样环境的软体机器人协同设计平台。SoftZoo支持广泛、自然启发的材料组合，包括能够模拟平地、沙漠、湿地、黏土、冰、雪、浅水和海洋等多种环境。此外，它提供了多个与软体机器人相关的任务，包括快速移动、灵活转向和路径跟随，以及形态和控制的可微分设计表示。结合一致的评估指标，SoftZoo允许在方法之间进行直接比较，并揭示软体机器人设计中的权衡。",
