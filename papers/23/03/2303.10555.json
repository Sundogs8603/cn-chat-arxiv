    "translated_abstract": "LiDAR（光学遥感）是进行精确长距离和宽范围 3D 感应的不可或缺的传感器，直接造福于自动驾驶技术的快速推广。同时，这种安全关键的应用强烈推动了对其安全性的研究。最近的研究表明，攻击者可以通过向 LiDAR 发送恶意激光来操纵 LiDAR 点云并欺骗目标检测。然而，这些研究面临三个关键的研究难点：（1）仅评估特定的 LiDAR（VLP-16）；（2）假设攻击能力未被验证；以及（3）评估受限的数据集上训练的模型。为了填补这些关键的研究难点，我们对总共9种流行的 LiDAR 和3种主要类型的目标检测器进行了第一次大规模的 LiDAR 欺骗攻击能力测量研究。为了进行这个测量，我们通过更加小心的光学和功能电子学，显著提高了 LiDAR 欺骗能力，展示了一种新的攻击模式，可以甚至规避最先进的防御机制。我们的结果提供了关于如何在不同的实际设置中实际进行 LiDAR 欺骗攻击的见解，并呼吁安全的 LiDAR 设计和评估方法。",
