    "translated_abstract": "大多数视觉注意力模型旨在预测自上而下或自下而上控制，采用不同的视觉搜索和自由观看任务进行研究。我们提出了一个称为人类注意力变换器的单一模型，可以预测这两种形式的注意力控制。HAT在预测目标存在和目标缺失搜索期间进行注视行为的扫描路径方面是新的最先进技术，在预测无任务自由观看注视路径方面匹配或超过了当前技术水平。HAT通过使用新颖的基于变换器的结构和简化的凹视网膜，共同创建类似于人类动态视觉工作记忆的时空意识，实现了这种新的技术水平。与以前依赖于粗糙的注视单元格网格并由于离散化固定而经历信息丢失的方法不同，HAT具有密集预测架构，并为每个注视输出密集热图，从而避免离散注视。HAT在计算视觉注意力方面设定了一个新的标准。",
