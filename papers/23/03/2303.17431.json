    "abstract": "In the context of Epidemic Intelligence, many Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) systems have been proposed in the literature to promote the early identification and characterization of potential health threats from online sources of any nature. Each EBS system has its own surveillance definitions and priorities, therefore this makes the task of selecting the most appropriate EBS system for a given situation a challenge for end-users. In this work, we propose a new evaluation framework to address this issue. It first transforms the raw input epidemiological event data into a set of normalized events with multi-granularity, then conducts a descriptive retrospective analysis based on four evaluation objectives: spatial, temporal, thematic and source analysis. We illustrate its relevance by applying it to an Avian Influenza dataset collected by a selection of EBS systems, and show how our framework allows identifying their strengths and drawbacks in terms of epidemic surveillance.",

    "translated_abstract": "在流行病情报的背景下，文献中提出了许多面向事件的监测系统，以促进从任何类型的在线信息源中尽早识别和描述潜在健康威胁。每种系统都有其自己的监测定义和优先级，因此选择最适合给定情况的面向事件监测系统对终端用户来说是一个挑战。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新的评估框架来解决这个问题。它首先将原始输入的流行病事件数据转化为一组具有多粒度的归一化事件，然后基于四个评估目标（空间、时间、主题和来源分析）进行描述性回顾分析。我们通过将其应用于一组由不同面向事件监测系统收集的禽流感数据集，并展示了如何利用我们的框架来确定其在流行病监测方面的优缺点。",
