    "translated_abstract": "在神经进化计算的背景下，质量多样性算法通过依赖行为空间的定义来生成各种不同和高效的策略集合，取得了很好的效果。然而，在不确定的环境中，会有两个问题出现。第一，策略可能缺乏鲁棒性和可重复性，即在略微不同的情况下，多个 episodes 往往会导致非常不同的行为结果。第二，由于策略集的离散性，解决方案的变化是不连续的。本文提出了一种新的方法来实现基于行为条件下的轨迹生成，其基于两个机制：首先是 MAP-Elites Low-Spread (ME-LS)，它限制了选择那些在行为空间上最一致的解决方案。其次是质量多样性变形器 (QDT)，它是基于 Transformer 的。",
