    "translated_abstract": "近年来，图神经网络被引入用于学习知识图谱，并在知识图谱推理方面取得了最先进的性能。然而，对于它们良好的经验性能缺乏理论证明。此外，虽然知识图谱中的逻辑对于归纳和可解释的推理非常重要，但现有的基于图神经网络的方法只是为了适应数据分布，并且对它们的逻辑表达能力知之甚少。本文旨在填补上述空白。具体而言，我们从逻辑的表达能力对GNN进行理论分析，并找出知识图谱中可以捕获哪些逻辑规则。我们的结果首先表明，GNN可以从分级模态逻辑中捕获逻辑规则，为分析GNN在知识图谱推理方面的表达能力提供了新的理论工具；而一个查询标记技巧使得GNN更容易捕获逻辑规则，解释了为什么最先进的方法主要基于标记技巧。最后，我们理论上的见解促进了一个新的基于GNN的知识图谱推理方法的设计，它可以充分利用逻辑表达能力并实现更好的性能。",
