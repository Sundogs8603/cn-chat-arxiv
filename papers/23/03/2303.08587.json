    "translated_abstract": "在许多领域中，准确地建模时间序列非常重要。由于世界通常过于复杂以至无法准确地建模，因此评估动态系统处于特定状态的概率常常有意义。本文提出了Delay-SDE-net，这是一种基于随机延迟微分方程（SDDEs）的神经网络模型。使用具有多个延迟的SDDE作为建模框架，使其成为具有记忆效应的时间序列的合适模型，因为它通过系统之前的状态包括记忆。 Delay-SDE-net的随机部分提供了估计建模中不确定性的基础，并被分成两个神经网络以解释先验性和后验性不确定性。这种不确定性是实时提供的，使得该模型适用于时间匮乏的应用。我们推导了Delay-SDE-net的理论误差，并进行了数值收敛率分析。在与类似模型的比较中，Delay-SDE-net显示出更加稳定的性能。",
