    "translated_abstract": "近期的研究显著提高了使用图神经网络预测出行需求的准确性。然而，这些研究很大程度上忽略了出行需求预测中不可避免的不确定性。为了填补这一空白，本研究提出了一种概率图神经网络（Prob-GNN）框架，用于量化出行需求的时空不确定性。这个Prob-GNN框架基于确定性和概率假设，并在芝加哥市预测公共交通和拼车需求的任务上得到了实证应用。我们发现，概率假设（如分布尾部、支持）对不确定性预测的影响大于确定性假设（如深度模块、深度）。在Prob-GNN家族中，采用截断高斯和拉普拉斯分布的GNN在公共交通和拼车数据中表现最佳。即使在存在明显域偏移情况下，Prob-GNNs",
