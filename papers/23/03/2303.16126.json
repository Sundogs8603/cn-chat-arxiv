    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于克劳德·香农的信息和Ruslan Stratonovich的工作的信息价值（VoI）的通用概念，该概念具有贝叶斯决策理论和需求分析所需的理想属性。将Shannon / Stratonovich VoI概念与Hartley VoI概念进行比较，并应用于环形设置的典型经济应用，该设置概括了Ruslan Stratonovich的示例，并允许网络结构和不同经济运输成本的调查。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a universal concept for the Value of Information (VoI) based on Claude Shannon's information and the work of Ruslan Stratonovich. It is compared to the concept of Hartley VoI and applied to a circular setting in economics that generalizes Stratonovich's previous work and investigates various economic transport costs. The proposed concept has significant implications."
