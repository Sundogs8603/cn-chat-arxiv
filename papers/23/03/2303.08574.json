    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of automatic generation of computer programs from a few pairs of input-output examples. The starting point of this work is the observation that in many applications a solution program must use external knowledge not present in the examples: we call such programs knowledge-powered since they can refer to information collected from a knowledge graph such as Wikipedia. This paper makes a first step towards knowledge-powered program synthesis. We present WikiCoder, a system building upon state of the art machine-learned program synthesizers and integrating knowledge graphs. We evaluate it to show its wide applicability over different domains and discuss its limitations. WikiCoder solves tasks that no program synthesizers were able to solve before thanks to the use of knowledge graphs, while integrating with recent developments in the field to operate at scale.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了从一些输入输出的例子中自动生成计算机程序的问题。本文的出发点是观察到在许多应用中，解决方案程序必须使用输入输出例子中不存在的外部知识：我们称这样的程序为知识增强程序，因为它们可以参考从知识图谱（例如维基百科）中收集的信息。本文迈出了向知识增强程序合成的第一步。我们提出了 WikiCoder，该系统基于最先进的机器学习程序合成器，并集成了知识图谱。我们评估了它以展示其在不同领域中的广泛适用性，并讨论了其局限性。WikiCoder利用知识图谱解决了以前没有程序合成器能够解决的任务，并与该领域的最新发展相结合，以实现大规模运作。",
