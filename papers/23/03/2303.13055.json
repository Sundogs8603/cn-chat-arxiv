The survey encompasses well known deep learning techniques (deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks) and datasets widely used to design user interface applications. We highlight important problems and emerging research frontiers in this field. We believe that the use of deep learning for user interface design automation tasks could be one of the high potential fields for the advancement of the software development industry.",
