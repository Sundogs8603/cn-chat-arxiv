    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶系统依赖于3D物体检测器从LiDAR点云中识别可能的障碍物，但是最近的研究表明，攻击者可以使用少量的伪造点（即出现攻击）在预测结果中伪造不存在的车辆。现有的防御措施通过去除统计上的离群值来针对特定攻击或通过预定义的启发式规则进行防御。为了更全面地减轻攻击，我们首先系统地检查了最近出现的攻击机制：他们的共同弱点在于伪造的障碍物(i)与真实障碍物相比具有明显的局部差异，(ii)违反了深度和点密度之间的物理关系。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的即插即用的防御模块，它可以在受过训练的基于LiDAR的物体检测器的一侧工作，以消除伪造的障碍物，其中大部分局部部分的物体性较低，即它属于实际物体的程度。我们设计的核心是变体连体网络（VSN），它将检测器的原始和屏蔽输入都作为输入，并为识别假点生成成对相似性图。实验表明，我们的方法可以在没有任何先前攻击知识的情况下有效地防御出现攻击，在两个基准数据集上的平均点对点F1分数为96.2％。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a defensive module to protect LiDAR-based object detectors in automated driving systems from appearing attacks. The module eliminates forged obstacles with low objectness in local parts and uses a Variant Siamese Network for identification without prior knowledge of the attacks. The method achieves an average point-wise F1-score of 96.2% on two benchmark datasets."
