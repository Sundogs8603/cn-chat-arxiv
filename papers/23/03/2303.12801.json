    "abstract": "Detection of pulmonary nodules by CT is used for screening lung cancer in early stages.omputer aided diagnosis (CAD) based on deep-learning method can identify the suspected areas of pulmonary nodules in CT images, thus improving the accuracy and efficiency of CT diagnosis. The accuracy and robustness of deep learning models. Method:In this paper, we explore (1) the data augmentation method based on the generation model and (2) the model structure improvement method based on the embedding mechanism. Two strategies have been introduced in this study: a new data augmentation method and a embedding mechanism. In the augmentation method, a 3D pixel-level statistics algorithm is proposed to generate pulmonary nodule and by combing the faked pulmonary nodule and healthy lung, we generate new pulmonary nodule samples. The embedding mechanism are designed to better understand the meaning of pixels of the pulmonary nodule samples by introducing hidden variables. Result: The result of the 3DVNET",
