    "abstract": "Existing conversational models are handled by a database(DB) and API based systems. However, very often users' questions require information that cannot be handled by such systems. Nonetheless, answers to these questions are available in the form of customer reviews and FAQs. DSTC-11 proposes a three stage pipeline consisting of knowledge seeking turn detection, knowledge selection and response generation to create a conversational model grounded on this subjective knowledge. In this paper, we focus on improving the knowledge selection module to enhance the overall system performance. In particular, we propose entity retrieval methods which result in an accurate and faster knowledge search. Our proposed Named Entity Recognition (NER) based entity retrieval method results in 7X faster search compared to the baseline model. Additionally, we also explore a potential keyword extraction method which can improve the accuracy of knowledge selection. Preliminary results show a 4 \\% improvement",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的对话模型都是基于数据库和API的系统来处理的。但是，用户的问题经常需要处理这些系统无法处理的信息。然而，这些问题的答案可以在客户评价和常见问题解答中找到。DSTC-11提出了一个由三个部分组成的管道，包括知识寻求回合检测、知识选择和响应生成，从而创建一个基于主观知识的交互式模型。本文着重于改进知识选择模块，以提高整个系统的性能。我们提出了一种实体检索方法，它可以实现准确和更快的知识搜索。我们提出的基于命名实体识别(NER)的实体检索方法比基线模型快了7倍。此外，我们还探讨了一种潜在的关键字提取方法，可以提高知识选择的准确性。初步结果显示了4\\%的改进。",
