    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于深度架构的方法，从社交媒体帖子中检测抑郁症。该方法基于BERT从社交媒体帖子中提取语言表示，并利用一个具有注意力机制的双向GRU网络将这些表示组合起来。我们利用预先训练的情感分类器提取的特征来增加文本表示的情感信息。我们参考心理学文献的建议，提出使用后期融合方案将帖子和单词的亵渎和道德特征纳入到我们的架构中。结果表明，亵渎和道德特征对于抑郁症的检测是重要的。我们将该模型应用于Reddit Pirina数据集上的抑郁症检测，并进一步考虑在Reddit RSDD数据集中检测发帖用户的抑郁症状态，该数据集考虑了每个用户的多个帖子。采用我们提出的特征的结果在两个设置下均取得了最先进的成果，即2.65%和6.73%的绝对误差率。",
