The model is also suitable for high-dimensional cases where multivariate ARCH models are typically no longer applicable. We adopt the theoretical foundations from spatiotemporal statistics and transfer the dynamic ARCH model for processes to networks. This new approach is compared with independent univariate log-ARCH models.
