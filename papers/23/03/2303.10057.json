    "abstract": "Background: In medical imaging, images are usually treated as deterministic, while their uncertainties are largely underexplored. Purpose: This work aims at using deep learning to efficiently estimate posterior distributions of imaging parameters, which in turn can be used to derive the most probable parameters as well as their uncertainties. Methods: Our deep learning-based approaches are based on a variational Bayesian inference framework, which is implemented using two different deep neural networks based on conditional variational auto-encoder (CVAE), CVAE-dual-encoder and CVAE-dual-decoder. The conventional CVAE framework, i.e., CVAE-vanilla, can be regarded as a simplified case of these two neural networks. We applied these approaches to a simulation study of dynamic brain PET imaging using a reference region-based kinetic model. Results: In the simulation study, we estimated posterior distributions of PET kinetic parameters given a measurement of time-activity curve. Our propose",
