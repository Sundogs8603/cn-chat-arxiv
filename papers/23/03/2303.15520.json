    "translated_abstract": "分子表示学习在人工智能辅助药物发现研究中起着至关重要的作用。通过欧几里得神经网络对三维分子结构进行编码已成为几何深度学习社区的主流方法。然而，欧几里得空间中的等变性约束和消息传递可能会限制网络的表达能力。在本文中，我们提出了一种谐波分子表示学习（HMR）框架，它使用分子表面的拉普拉斯-贝尔特拉米特征函数来表示分子。HMR在2D黎曼流形上提供了分子几何和化学特征的多分辨率表示。我们还引入了一种谐波消息传递方法，在表面流形上实现高效的谱消息传递以实现更好的分子编码。我们提出的方法显示出与当前模型在小分子属性预测方面具有可比性的预测能力，并且在配体结合中优于最先进的深度学习模型。",
