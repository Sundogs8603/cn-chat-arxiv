The resulting method can be generically applied to any deep neural network providing masks in the time-frequency domain, while requiring only few more trainable parameters and a computational overhead that is negligible for state-of-the-art neural networks.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种方案，将基于深度神经网络的乘法遮罩扩展到深度子带滤波中，以在时频域中实现语音恢复。结果方法可通用于提供在时频域中的遮罩的任何深度神经网络，只需要更少的可训练参数和对于最先进的神经网络可忽略的计算开销。我们证明，结果深度子带滤波方案优于乘法遮罩去混响，而几乎不影响去噪性能。我们认为，这是因为时频域中的深度子带滤波适用于混响消除文献中常用的子带近似，而乘法遮罩则对于一般用于去噪的窄带近似。",
