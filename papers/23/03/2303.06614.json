    "abstract": "A key theme in the past decade has been that when large neural networks and large datasets combine they can produce remarkable results. In deep reinforcement learning (RL), this paradigm is commonly made possible through experience replay, whereby a dataset of past experiences is used to train a policy or value function. However, unlike in supervised or self-supervised learning, an RL agent has to collect its own data, which is often limited. Thus, it is challenging to reap the benefits of deep learning, and even small neural networks can overfit at the start of training. In this work, we leverage the tremendous recent progress in generative modeling and propose Synthetic Experience Replay (SynthER), a diffusion-based approach to flexibly upsample an agent's collected experience. We show that SynthER is an effective method for training RL agents across offline and online settings, in both proprioceptive and pixel-based environments. In offline settings, we observe drastic improvements ",

    "translated_abstract": "过去十年的一个关键主题是，当大型神经网络和大型数据集相结合时，它们可以产生令人惊异的结果。在深度强化学习中，这种范式通常通过经验回放实现，其中过去的经验数据集用于训练策略或值函数。然而，与监督学习或自监督学习不同，强化学习代理必须收集自己的数据，这通常是有限的。因此，利用深度学习的好处是具有挑战性的，即使是小型神经网络在训练开始时也可能出现过拟合现象。在这项工作中，我们利用了生成建模的巨大进步，并提出了合成经验回放（SynthER），一种基于扩散的方法来灵活地上采样代理收集的经验。我们证明了SynthER是一种有效的方法，可以在离线和在线设置下训练强化学习代理，无论是在感知环境还是在像素环境中。在离线设置中，我们观察到了显着的改进。",
