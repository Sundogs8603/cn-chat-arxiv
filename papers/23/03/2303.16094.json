    "translated_abstract": "将二维大内核的成功扩展到三维感知是具有挑战性的，因为1.处理三维数据的开销成倍增长；2.由于数据稀疏性和稀缺性而产生的优化困难。先前的工作通过引入块共享权重来将内核大小从3x3x3扩展到7x7x7迈出了第一步。然而，为了减少块内特征变化，它仅采用适度的块尺寸，并未实现像21x21x21这样的更大内核。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新方法LinK，以卷积的方式通过两个核心设计在适应非空体素提供权重的基础上实现更广泛的感知接收域。其一是用线性内核生成器替换静态内核矩阵，仅适应非空体素提供权重。其二是重复使用重叠块的预计算聚合结果，以减少计算复杂度。该方法成功地使每个体素在维持2D卷积级别的计算复杂度的同时感知21x21x21范围内的上下文。",
