    "abstract": "New knowledge originates from the old. The various types of elements, deposited in the training history, are a large amount of wealth for improving learning deep models. In this survey, we comprehensively review and summarize the topic--``Historical Learning: Learning Models with Learning History'', which learns better neural models with the help of their learning history during its optimization, from three detailed aspects: Historical Type (what), Functional Part (where) and Storage Form (how). To our best knowledge, it is the first survey that systematically studies the methodologies which make use of various historical statistics when training deep neural networks. The discussions with related topics like recurrent/memory networks, ensemble learning, and reinforcement learning are demonstrated. We also expose future challenges of this topic and encourage the community to pay attention to the think of historical learning principles when designing algorithms. The paper list related to",

    "translated_abstract": "新的知识源于旧的知识。在训练历史记录中存储的各种类型的元素对于改善深度学习模型的学习非常有帮助。本文综述了“历史学习：带有学习历史的学习模型”这个主题，系统地研究从历史统计数据中进行深度神经网络训练的方法，涵盖历史类型、功能部分和存储形式三个方面。我们认为，这是首个系统研究利用各种历史统计数据进行深度神经网络训练的综述论文。文章还讨论了与此相关的话题，如循环/记忆网络、集成学习和强化学习。最后，我们还指出了这个主题的未来挑战，并鼓励学术界在设计算法时认真思考历史学习原则。",
