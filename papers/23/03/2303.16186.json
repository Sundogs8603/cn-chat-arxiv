    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑一种情境，即虽然可以接触目标领域，但无法进行即时训练数据标注，相反，希望从大规模数据池中构建替代训练集，以获得竞争性模型。我们在物体重新识别（re-ID）中提出了一个搜索和修剪（SnP）的解决方案，该应用旨在匹配由不同摄像机捕获的相同对象。具体而言，搜索阶段确定并合并展现与目标领域具有类似分布的源标识符群集。第二阶段在预算限制下，从阶段I输出中选择标识符及其图像，以控制结果训练集的大小，以进行高效训练。这两个步骤提供了比源池小80％的训练集，同时实现了与源池同样或甚至更高的re-ID准确性。这些训练集也被证明优于一些现有的搜索算法。",
