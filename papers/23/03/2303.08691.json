    "translated_abstract": "无监督学习的最新进展突出了仅从噪声和不完整的线性测量中学习信号重构的可能性。这些方法在医学和科学成像以及传感中起到关键作用，其中地面真实数据经常稀缺或难以获得。然而，在实践中，测量不仅噪声和不完整，而且还被量化。在这里，我们探索从二进制观察中学习的极端情况，并提供了关于从不完整二进制数据中识别一组信号所需的测量数量的必要和充分条件。我们的结果是对从二进制测量中信号恢复现有界限的补充。此外，我们引入了一种新颖的自监督学习方法，我们将其命名为“SSBM”，它仅需要二进制数据进行训练。我们在一系列真实数据集上的实验证明SSBM与监督学习相当，并优于稀疏重构方法。",
