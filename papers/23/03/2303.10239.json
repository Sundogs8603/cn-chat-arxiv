We devise a new unsupervised method for classifying publications, based on topic modeling, and use a DFT-related selection of documents as a use case.

    "translated_abstract": "随着越来越多的科学论文发布，研究人员要意识到他们所研究领域中的最新文章变得更加困难。精确地对论文进行分类是个性化定制以及易于访问感兴趣研究的第一步。 特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）领域是一个很好的例子，用于不同的研究和相互关联的学科，并且具有非常强大的社区出版许多研究文章。 我们设计了一种新的无监督方法来对出版物进行分类，基于主题建模，使用DFT相关的文档作为用例。 我们首先从出版物的摘要中进行单词分析和聚类来创建主题，然后根据单词相似性将每个出版物/论文归属于某一主题。 然后，我们通过分析主题和出版商、期刊、国家或出版年份之间的联系来作出有趣的观察。 所提出的方法适用于DFT范围之外的其他学科，并有助于更好地组织和访问相关的科学论文。",
