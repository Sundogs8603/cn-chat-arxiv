    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了平滑（强）凸有限和最小化问题的无替换随机梯度下降（SGD）的收敛下界。与大多数现有的结果侧重于最终迭代下界，这些下界是关于组件数$n$和迭代次数$K$的，我们寻求各种带权重平均迭代的下界，这些下界在包括条件数$k$在内的所有因素中都是紧的。对于带随机洗牌的SGD，我们提出了具有比现有下界更紧的$k$依赖性的下界。我们的结果是首个在强凸和凸情况下完全消除加权平均迭代的上下界差距的。我们还为任意基于置换的SGD证明了加权平均迭代的下界，这适用于所有小心选择最佳置换的变体。我们的下界在$n$和$k$因素方面都优于现有下界，从而与最近提出的算法的上界相一致。",
