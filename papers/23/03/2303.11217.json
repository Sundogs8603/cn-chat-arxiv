    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose to regularize ill-posed inverse problems using a deep hierarchical variational autoencoder (HVAE) as an image prior. The proposed method synthesizes the advantages of i) denoiser-based Plug \\& Play approaches and ii) generative model based approaches to inverse problems. First, we exploit VAE properties to design an efficient algorithm that benefits from convergence guarantees of Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods. Second, our approach is not restricted to specialized datasets and the proposed PnP-HVAE model is able to solve image restoration problems on natural images of any size. Our experiments show that the proposed PnP-HVAE method is competitive with both SOTA denoiser-based PnP approaches, and other SOTA restoration methods based on generative models.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出使用深层分层变分自动编码器（HVAE）作为图像先验对不适定的逆问题进行正则化的方法。该方法综合了基于去噪器的Plug & Play方法和基于生成模型的逆问题方法的优势。首先，我们利用VAE的特性设计了一种高效的算法，从而受益于Plug-and-Play（PnP）方法的收敛保证。其次，我们的方法不限于专门的数据集，所提出的PnP-HVAE模型能够解决任意尺寸的自然图像的图像恢复问题。实验结果表明，所提出的PnP-HVAE方法在与基于去噪器的Plug & Play方法和基于生成模型的其他现有恢复方法相比具有竞争力。",
