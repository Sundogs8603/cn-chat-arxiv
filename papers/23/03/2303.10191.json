    "translated_abstract": "合成医学图像生成已成为神经网络训练和验证的关键技术。然而，模拟数据和真实数据之间的领域差距仍是一个核心难题。尽管基于循环生成对抗网络和类似架构的深度学习领域转移在该领域取得了实质性进展，但在某些用例中，最先进的方法仍无法生成使相关下游任务产生令人信服结果的训练图像。在本文中，我们通过基于条件可逆神经网络（cINNs）的域转移方法来解决这个问题。作为一个特别的优势，我们的方法通过其可逆架构从本质上保证了循环一致性，而网络训练可以有效地进行最大似然训练。为了展示我们方法的通用适用性，我们将其应用于两个不同尺度的光谱成像模态——高光谱成像（像素级）和光声成像（图像级）。我们提出的方法在视觉真实性和定量性能方面优于最先进的方法，并且关键地避免了模式崩溃问题。",
