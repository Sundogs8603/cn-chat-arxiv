    "translated_abstract": "当涉及到自动化领域中CAD模型的优化时，神经网络目前只起到了较小的作用。优化抽象特性如自动化能力是具有挑战性的，因为它们很难被模拟，对于基于规则的系统来说过于复杂，而且机器学习方法缺乏数据。另一方面，像StyleCLIP这样的可操纵图像中的抽象特征方法已经取得了很大的成功。它们依赖于预训练生成对抗性网络的潜空间，并且因此也可以利用大量未标记的CAD数据。在本文中，我们展示了这种方法也适用于优化CAD零件的抽象自动化相关特征。我们通过扩展StyleCLIP以适用于体素模型形式的CAD模型实现了这一点，其中包括使用3D StyleGAN和自定义分类器。最后，我们演示了我们的系统通过优化实际CAD模型的自动化能力而具备的能力。",
