    "translated_abstract": "由于脉冲稀疏性，脉冲神经网络（SNN）可以以低功耗进行推理。ANN-SNN转换是将经过良好训练的人工神经网络（ANNs）转换为深度SNN的有效方法。然而，现有方法通常使用常数阈值进行转换，这会阻止神经元快速传递脉冲到更深的层，并导致高时间延迟。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个多阶段自适应阈值（MSAT）的生物学模型机制。对于每个神经元，动态阈值随着发放历史和输入属性而变化，并且与平均膜电位正相关，与去极化率负相关。这种自适应膜电位和输入的方式可以及时调整阈值，更快地传递脉冲并传输更多信息。此外，我们引入了一种新颖的权重自适应算法来微调转换后的SNN，这显著提高了ANN-SNN转换的性能。实验表明，我们的方法在准确性和效率方面均优于现有的最新方法。",
