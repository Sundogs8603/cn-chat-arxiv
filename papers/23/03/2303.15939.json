    "translated_abstract": "数字图像相关（DIC）已成为评估力学实验的有价值工具，特别是疲劳裂纹增长实验。评估需要准确的裂纹路径和裂纹尖端位置信息，由于固有噪声和伪影的原因，这很难获得。机器学习模型在给定标记的DIC位移数据的情况下识别此相关信息非常成功。为了训练具有广泛泛化能力的强大模型，需要大数据。然而，由于实验昂贵且耗时，材料科学和工程领域的数据通常很少。 我们提出了一种使用具有物理引导鉴别器的生成式对抗网络来生成人造DIC位移数据的方法。为了决定数据样本是真实还是假的，该鉴别器另外接收导出的von Mises等效应变。我们显示，这种物理引导方法相比传统GAN产生了更准确和稳健的结果。我们的方法允许产生大量的人造DIC数据，以训练机器学习模型，从而实现更准确可靠的疲劳裂纹增长评估的发展。",
