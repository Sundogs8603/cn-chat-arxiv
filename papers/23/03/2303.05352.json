    "abstract": "There has been a growing effort to replace hand extraction of data from research papers with automated data extraction based on natural language processing, language models, and recently, large language models (LLMs). Although these methods enable efficient extraction of data from large sets of research papers, they require a significant amount of up-front effort, expertise, and coding. In this work we propose the ChatExtract method that can fully automate very accurate data extraction with minimal initial effort and background, using an advanced conversational LLM. ChatExtract consists of a set of engineered prompts applied to a conversational LLM that both identify sentences with data, extract that data, and assure the data's correctness through a series of follow-up questions. These follow-up questions largely overcome known issues with LLMs providing factually inaccurate responses. ChatExtract can be applied with any conversational LLMs and yields very high quality data extraction.",

    "translated_abstract": "人们正在不断努力用自然语言处理、语言模型和最近出现的大型语言模型（LLM）代替手工从研究论文中提取数据的工作。尽管这些方法可以高效地从大量研究论文中提取数据，但它们需要大量的前期努力、专业知识和编码。在这项工作中，我们提出了ChatExtract方法，它可以通过一个先进的对话式LLM自动提取极准确的数据，几乎不需要初期的努力和背景知识。ChatExtract由一组工程化的提示应用于对话式LLM，既可以识别出具有数据的句子，提取出这些数据，又可以通过一系列跟进问题确保数据的正确性。这些跟进问题很大程度上克服了LLM提供事实不准确答案的已知问题。ChatExtract可以应用于任何对话式LLM，并能提供非常高质量的数据提取。",
