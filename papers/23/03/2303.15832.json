This perspective will highlight several aspects of experimental fluid mechanics that stand to benefit from progress advances in machine learning, including: 1) augmenting the fidelity and quality of measurement techniques, 2) improving experimental design and surrogate digital-twin models and 3) enabling real-time estimation and control. In each case, we discuss recent success stories and ongoing challenges, along with caveats and limitations, and outline the potential for new avenues of ML-augmented and ML-enabled experimental fluid mechanics.",
