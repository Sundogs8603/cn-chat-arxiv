    "translated_abstract": "在神经解码研究中，最引人注目的话题之一是基于fMRI信号重建感知到的自然图像。先前的研究已经成功地重新创建了视觉的不同方面，例如低水平属性（形状、纹理、布局）或高水平特征（对象类别、场景细节语义），但通常无法同时为复杂的场景图像重建这些属性。生成AI最近通过能够生成高复杂度图像的潜在扩散模型迈出了重要一步。在这里，我们探讨如何利用这种创新技术进行脑解码。我们提出了一个名为“Brain-Diffuser”的两阶段场景重建框架。在第一阶段，从fMRI信号开始，我们使用VDVAE（非常深的变分自编码器）模型重建图像，捕捉低水平属性和总体布局。在第二阶段中，我们使用潜在扩散模型的图像到图像框架来提取更高级别的信息，从而重建复杂的场景图像。",
