    "translated_abstract": "数据驱动的基于模型的离线优化是解决黑盒计算设计问题的实际方法，因为真实的目标函数未知且昂贵且难以查询。然而，标准方法优化设计与基础真实目标的学习代理模型可能会受到分布变化的影响。特别是在高维设计空间中，有效设计位于狭窄流形上，标准方法易于产生“误导”代理模型输出高值的越界无效设计。使用集合而不是单个模型作为代理模型有助于缓解分布的变化，但是从集合中组合梯度信息的朴素公式（例如最小和平均梯度）仍然是次优的并且经常受到不收敛的影响。在本文中，我们探索了从集合中组合梯度信息的替代方法，这些方法对分布变化有鲁棒性，利用最近的鲁棒优化和不确定性评估来提高性能。我们的方法涉及使用辅助“清洗”目标来识别设计空间的区域，其中集合可能产生无效梯度，然后自适应地减小优化期间的这些梯度的权重，以避免探索不可行的区域。我们在几个合成和实际的设计问题上展示了我们的方法的有效性，与标准的基于模型的离线优化方法相比，在优化性能方面获得了显着的改进。",
