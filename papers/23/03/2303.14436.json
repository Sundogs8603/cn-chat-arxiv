Over-increasing population growth overpowers the volume of most municipal authorities to provide even the most essential services.

    "translated_abstract": "全球每个人都会产生垃圾。南非是一个发展中国家，许多城镇仅有有限的废弃物资源。城镇中的垃圾来源包括乱扔、垃圾桶倒置、树木被剪枝、垃圾被倒在河边以及废弃物无法回收利用。这些废弃物导致了病菌数量增加、空气污染、环境污染以及温室气体排放的增加。未收集的垃圾被随意丢弃在街道和排水沟中，导致洪水、传染病和啮齿动物的滋生和传播。本文旨在为约翰内斯堡市设计一种智能垃圾管理系统，此城市已有垃圾管理员提供垃圾资源，如废弃物垃圾桶和垃圾车。",
