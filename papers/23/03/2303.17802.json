The key idea is to monitor slight temporal variations of the difference subspace between two signal subspaces corresponding to the past and present time-series data, as anomaly score. It is a natural generalization of the conventional SSA-based method which measures the minimum angle between the two signal subspaces as the degree of changes. By replacing the minimum angle with the difference subspace, our method boosts the performance while using the SSA-based framework as it can capture the whole structural difference between the two subspaces in its magnitude and direction. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness through performance evaluations on public time-series datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于奇异谱分析(SSA)和差异子空间概念的新型时间序列异常检测方法。其关键思想是通过监控过去和现在时间序列数据所对应的两个信号子空间之间轻微的时间变化来作为异常评分。这是传统SSA方法的自然推广，传统方法测量的是两个信号子空间之间的最小角度来表征变化的程度。通过用差异子空间替代最小角度，我们的方法在使用SSA框架的同时提高了性能，因为它可以捕捉到两个子空间之间的完整结构差异。我们通过对公共时间序列数据集的性能评估证明了方法的有效性。",
