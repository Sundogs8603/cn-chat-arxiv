    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统很容易面临用户偏好移位的问题。如果用户偏好随着时间的推移而发生了变化，用户表示将变得过时，从而导致不适当的推荐。为了解决这个问题，现有的工作专注于学习稳健的表示或预测变化模式，缺乏发现用户偏好移位的潜在原因的全面视角。为了理解偏好移位，我们抽象了一个因果图，描述了用户交互序列的生成过程。假设用户偏好在短时间内是稳定的，我们将交互序列抽象为一组时间顺序的环境。从因果图中，我们发现一些未观察到的因素的变化（例如怀孕）导致了环境之间的偏好移位。此外，用户对不同类别的精细偏好稀疏地影响与不同项目的交互。受到因果图的启示，我们关注处理偏好移位问题的关键考虑。",
