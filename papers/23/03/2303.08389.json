    "abstract": "Vulnerability to lexical perturbation is a critical weakness of automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning. This paper proposes Perturbation Robust Multi-Lingual CLIPScore(PR-MCS), which exhibits robustness to such perturbations, as a novel reference-free image captioning metric applicable to multiple languages. To achieve perturbation robustness, we fine-tune the text encoder of CLIP with our language-agnostic method to distinguish the perturbed text from the original text. To verify the robustness of PR-MCS, we introduce a new fine-grained evaluation dataset consisting of detailed captions, critical objects, and the relationships between the objects for 3, 000 images in five languages. In our experiments, PR-MCS significantly outperforms baseline metrics in capturing lexical noise of all various perturbation types in all five languages, proving that PR-MCS is highly robust to lexical perturbations.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动评估图像字幕的指标对于词汇扰动的易受攻击性是一个关键弱点。本文提出了Perturbation Robust Multi-Lingual CLIPScore（PR-MCS），它能够表现出对这种扰动的鲁棒性，并且是一种新的不需要参照物的适用于多种语言的图像字幕评估指标。为了实现扰动鲁棒性，我们使用我们的语言无关方法对CLIP的文本编码器进行微调，以区分扰动文本和原始文本。为了验证PR-MCS的鲁棒性，我们引入了一个新的细粒度评估数据集，包括五种语言中 3,000 个图像的详细字幕，关键对象和对象之间的关系。在我们的实验中，PR-MCS 在捕获所有不同扰动类型的词汇噪声方面显着优于基线指标，证明了 PR-MCS 对于词汇扰动具有高度的鲁棒性。",
