    "translated_abstract": "电力系统的动力学由一组微分代数方程描述。时间域仿真用于理解系统动态的演变。由于系统的刚度需要使用精细离散化的时间步长，因此这些仿真可能具有计算代价较高的特点。通过增加允许的时间步长，我们旨在加快这样的仿真。本文使用观察结果，即尽管各个组件使用代数和微分方程来描述，但它们的耦合仅涉及代数方程的观察结果，利用神经网络（NN）来近似组件状态演变，从而产生快速、准确和数值稳定的近似器，使得可以使用更大的时间步长。为了解释网络对组件以及组件对网络的影响，NN将耦合代数变量的时间演化作为其预测的输入。我们最初使用空间分解方法来估计NN，其中系统被分成空间区域，每个区域有单独的NN估计器。我们将基于NN的仿真与传统的数值积分方案进行比较，以展示我们的方法的有效性。",
