    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种新的推理框架---代数机器推理，该框架非常适合抽象推理。代数机器推理有效地将解决新问题的困难过程简化为例行代数计算。感兴趣的基本代数对象是某些适当初始化的多项式环的理想。我们将解释如何将Raven渐进矩阵（RPM）的解决可以作为代数计算问题实现，这些问题结合了各种众所周知的代数子例程，包括：计算理想的Gröbner基，检查理想包含等。关键是，理想满足的附加代数结构允许进行更多的理想操作，超越了集合理论操作。我们的代数机器推理框架不仅能够从给定的答案集中选择正确的答案，而且还能仅凭问题矩阵给出正确的答案。在I-RAVEN数据集上的实验表明，对于RPM问题，我们的代数机器推理框架的总体准确率达到93.8％，优于传统的机器学习方法和人类表现。",
