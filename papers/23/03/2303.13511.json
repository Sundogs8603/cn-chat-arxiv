    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种名为神经预设的技术，用于解决现有颜色风格转移方法的限制，包括可视化伪影、大量内存需求和缓慢的风格切换速度。本方法基于两个核心设计。首先，我们提出了一种确定性神经颜色映射方法（DNCM），通过自适应的颜色映射矩阵在每个像素上进行一致的操作，避免了伪影，并支持具有小内存占用的高分辨率输入。其次，我们通过将任务分为颜色归一化和风格化两个阶段来开发一个两阶段流水线，可以通过将颜色风格作为预设提取，并在归一化的输入图像上重复使用它们来实现有效的风格切换。由于存在成对数据集的问题，我们描述了如何通过自监督策略训练神经预设模型。通过全面的评估展示了神经预设相对于现有方法的各种优势。此外，我们展示了我们训练的模型可以自然地支持多个风格，并在定量和定性性能上实现了最新的表现。",
