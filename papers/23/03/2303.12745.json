    "translated_abstract": "对话中的欺诈检测是一项具有挑战性但非常重要的任务，在商业的可信度评估、多媒体防欺诈和定制安全等许多领域都有重要的应用。然而，由于缺乏高质量的欺诈数据集以及学习多模态特征的困难，欺诈检测研究受到了阻碍。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了DOLOS数据集，这是包含丰富的欺骗对话的最大游戏节目欺骗检测数据集。DOLOS包括1,675个视频片段，涉及213个被试者，并且已经用音视频特征注释进行了标注。我们提供了训练-测试、持续时间和性别协议来调查不同因素的影响。我们在先前提出的欺骗检测方法上对我们的数据集进行了基准测试。为了通过微调更少的参数进一步提高性能，我们提出了参数高效跨模态学习（PECL），其中统一时间适配器（UT-Adapter）探索时间",
