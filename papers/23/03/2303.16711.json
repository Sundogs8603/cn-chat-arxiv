    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了对光滑Hilbert-Valued参数的估计器，其中光滑性由逐路径可微条件表征。当参数空间是重现核Hilbert空间时，我们提供了一种获取高效和相关置信区间的方法。这些估计器对应于基于Hilbert-Valued有效影响函数的交叉一步估计器的概括。我们提供了理论保证，即使使用任意的辅助函数估计器，包括基于机器学习技术的估计器。我们表明，即使缺乏重现核的Hilbert空间，只要参数具有高效的影响函数，这些结果自然地可以扩展到该空间。然而，我们也揭示了不幸的事实，当不存在重现核时，许多有趣的参数即使它们在路径上是可微的，也缺乏有效的影响函数。为了处理这些情况，我们提出了一种正则化的方法。",
