    "abstract": "Recent large language models (LLMs) in the general domain, such as ChatGPT, have shown remarkable success in following instructions and producing human-like responses. However, such language models have not been learned individually and carefully for the medical domain, resulting in poor diagnostic accuracy and inability to give correct recommendations for medical diagnosis, medications, etc. To address this issue, we collected more than 700 diseases and their corresponding symptoms, recommended medications, and required medical tests, and then generated 5K doctor-patient conversations. By fine-tuning models of doctor-patient conversations, these models emerge with great potential to understand patients' needs, provide informed advice, and offer valuable assistance in a variety of medical-related fields.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，在一般领域中应用的大型语言模型（LLM），例如ChatGPT，已经表现出仿佛是人类讲话般的成功。然而，这样的语言模型并没有经过个别且仔细为医学领域学习，导致诊断准确度低且不能给出正确的医疗诊断、药品等建议。为了解决这个问题，我们收集了700多种疾病及其相应症状、推荐药品和所需医疗检查，然后生成了5K名医患的对话。通过微调医患对话模型，这些模型具有了理解患者需求、提供明智建议并在各种医疗相关领域提供宝贵帮助的巨大潜力。将这些先进的语言模型集成到医疗保健中，可以彻底改变医疗专业人员和患者的沟通方式，最终改善整体质量。",
