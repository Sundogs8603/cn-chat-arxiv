    "translated_abstract": "近年来出现的多模式插电混合动力汽车(PHEV)技术是减少碳排放的途径之一，其能量管理需要多输入多输出(MIMO)控制。目前，现有的方法通常将MIMO控制解耦为单输出(MISO)控制，并且只能实现其局部最优性能。为了全局优化多模式车辆，本文研究了基于多智能体深度强化学习(MADRL)的多模式PHEV能量管理的MIMO控制方法。通过引入相关比例，提出了一种握手策略，使得两个学习智能体能够在MADRL框架下使用深度确定性策略梯度(DDPG)算法进行协作学习。通过对影响学习性能的影响因素进行灵敏度分析，得到了DDPG智能体的统一设置。握手策略的最优工作模式通过多目标函数得到，考虑燃料消耗、电池SOC变化和功率限制违规。基于硬件在环(HIL)仿真器的实验结果表明，所提出的MADRL能量管理方法在燃料消耗、SOC变化和功率限制违规方面优于传统的基于规则的方法和单个智能体RL方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a MIMO control method for energy management of multi-mode plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), which optimizes the global control through a hand-shaking strategy and a multi-objective function. Experimental results based on a hardware-in-the-loop simulator show that the proposed MADRL energy management method outperforms conventional methods in terms of fuel consumption, SOC variation, and power limit violation."
