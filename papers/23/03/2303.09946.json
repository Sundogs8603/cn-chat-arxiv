    "translated_abstract": "群集引导问题具有挑战性的结构，需要同时解决多个优化目标。这通常需要不同的控制方法来处理各种目标，例如引导、避碰和凝聚。特别是引导方案长期以来一直受到复杂的跟踪误差动力学的困扰。此外，基于平衡条件获取的线性反馈策略的技术，不可避免地在不确定的动态环境下不协调或者为不稳定状态。预调谐的模糊推理结构缺乏在这样的未建模条件下的鲁棒性。本文介绍了一种自适应分布式技术，用于群集系统的自主控制。它相对灵活的结构基于同时针对一些目标的在线模糊强化学习方案，即跟随领袖、避免碰撞和达到群体速度共识。除了在不确定性和干扰面前的弹性之外，所提出的方法保证了对名义条件的鲁棒和快速收敛性质。在各种实验场景中，所提出的算法在跟踪精度和碰撞避免率方面优于现有方案。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一个自适应模糊强化学习协作方法用于群集系统的自主控制。该方法针对跟随领袖、避免碰撞和达到群体速度共识三个目标，具有弹性和鲁棒性，且在实验中性能优于现有方案。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an adaptive fuzzy reinforcement learning cooperative approach for the autonomous control of flock systems which simultaneously targets three objectives: following a leader, avoiding collision, and reaching a flock velocity consensus. It exhibits resilience and robustness in uncertain and disturbance environments and outperforms existing schemes in terms of accuracy and collision avoidance rates in various experimental scenarios."
