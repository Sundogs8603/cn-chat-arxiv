In this paper, we propose a simple and effective solution to this limitation by using dilated convolutions to rescale the receptive fields of shallow layers in StyleGAN, without altering any model parameters. This allows fixed-size small features at shallow layers to be extended into larger ones that can accommodate variable resolutions, making them more robust in characterizing unaligned faces. To enable real face inversion and manipulation, we introduce a corresponding encoder that provides the first-layer feature of the extended StyleGAN in addition to the latent style code. We validate the effectiveness of our method using unaligned face inputs of various resolutions in a diverse set of face manipulation tasks, including facial attribute editing, super-resolution, sketch/mask-to-face ",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，使用StyleGAN进行人脸操纵取得了令人印象深刻的成果。然而，StyleGAN的局限性在于它仅适用于在预训练时固定图像分辨率下裁剪对齐的人脸。本文提出了一个简单且有效的解决方案，通过使用扩张卷积来重新调整StyleGAN浅层的感受野，而不改变任何模型参数。这使得浅层的固定尺寸小特征能够扩展成能适应不同分辨率的大特征，从而更好地描述不对齐的人脸。为了实现真实的人脸反演和操纵，我们引入了相应的编码器，除了潜在的风格编码外，还提供了扩展StyleGAN的第一层特征。我们使用各种分辨率的不对齐人脸输入验证了我们方法的有效性，包括面部属性编辑、超分辨率、素描/面具转换等各种人脸操纵任务。",
