    "translated_abstract": "最近，针对多项选择的常识问题回答的端到端训练模型取得了良好的结果。然而，在现实场景中，无法直接应用此类问答系统，因为没有提供答案候选人。因此，最近发布了一个新的基准挑战集（OpenCSR）用于开放式常识推理，其中包含自然科学问题而没有预定义的选项。在OpenCSR挑战集中，许多问题需要隐含的多跳推理并且决策空间很大，反映了这项任务的困难性质。现有的OpenCSR工作仅着眼于改进检索过程，从文本知识库中提取相关事实句子，而将重要且非平凡的推理任务超出范围。在本工作中，我们扩展范围，包括一个基于检索支撑事实构建问题相关开放知识图的推理器，并采用顺序",
