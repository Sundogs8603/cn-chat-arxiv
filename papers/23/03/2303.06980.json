    "translated_abstract": "定期监测是管理心血管疾病的必要方面。由于罕见或特定疾病的患者规模较小，观察也是间歇性的，因此其招募常常受到限制，而常见情况由于定期随访而更容易累积纵向数据。然而，这些数据以其无规律性、时间性、缺席性和稀疏性而闻名。本研究利用自监督学习和迁移学习来克服上述障碍，将心血管实验室指标的患者进展趋势从常见情况转移到罕见或特定心血管事件检测中。我们使用高血压患者（尚未患糖尿病）进行了一般实验室进展（GLP）预训练模型的预训练，并将其实验室进展趋势转移，以协助检测经皮冠状动脉介入治疗患者的靶血管重建（TVR）。GLP采用了两个阶段的训练过程，包括预训练和微调。",
