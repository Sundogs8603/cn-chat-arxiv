    "abstract": "The unit value of a commodity that Michio Morishima's method and its variations enable to determine correctly, is the sum of the value of the commodities it contains (inputs) and the quantity of labor required for its production. However, goods are sold at their market production price only when they meet a solvent social need that involves the entire economy with its interconnections between the different industrial sectors. This condition gives full meaning to Marx's fundamental equalities, which derive from the law of value and constitute invariants that apply to the economy as a whole. These equalities are necessary to determine market production prices. We demonstrate that they also enable to solve the transformation problem for a simple reproduction system without fixed capital by starting from Morishima's formalism and returning to a formalism closer to that used by Marx.",

    "translated_abstract": "Michio Morishima的方法可以正确确定商品的单位价值，即它所含的商品价值（输入）和生产所需的劳动量之和。但是，只有当商品满足涉及整个经济体系各个产业部门之间互相关联的有偿的社会需求时，它们才能以市场生产价格售出。这一条件充分体现了马克思的基本等式，这些等式源于价值法则，并构成适用于整个经济体系的不变量。这些等式是确定市场生产价格必需的。我们证明这些等式还能够用于解决一个没有固定资本的简单再生产系统的转型问题，从Morishima的形式主义出发并回归到更接近马克思所用形式主义。",
