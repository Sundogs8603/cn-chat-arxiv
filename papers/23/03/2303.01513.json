    "abstract": "Machine learning techniques are effective for building predictive models because they are good at identifying patterns in large datasets. Development of a model for complex real life problems often stops at the point of publication, proof of concept or when made accessible through some mode of deployment. However, a model in the medical domain risks becoming obsolete as soon as patient demographic changes. The maintenance and monitoring of predictive models post-publication is crucial to guarantee their safe and effective long term use. As machine learning techniques are effectively trained to look for patterns in available datasets, the performance of a model for complex real life problems will not peak and remain fixed at the point of publication or even point of deployment. Rather, data changes over time, and they also changed when models are transported to new places to be used by new demography.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习技术在构建预测模型方面具有良好效果，因为它们擅长识别大型数据集中的模式。然而，对于复杂的现实问题，模型的开发往往停留在发表论文、概念验证或通过某种部署模式的可访问性。然而，在医疗领域里，模型的患者人口会发生变化，因此模型的维护和监控是确保其长期安全有效使用的关键。由于机器学习技术是有效地训练以在可用数据集中寻找模式的，因此，对于复杂的现实问题，模型的性能不会在发表或部署时达到峰值后固定不变。相反，数据会随着时间的变化而产生变化，而当模型被运往新的地方供新的人群使用时，它们也会发生变化。",
