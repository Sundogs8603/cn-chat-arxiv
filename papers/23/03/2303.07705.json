    "abstract": "In this paper, we generalise the results presented in the literature for the ruin probability for the insurer--reinsurer model under a pro-rata reinsurance contract. We consider claim amounts that are described by a phase-type distribution that includes exponential, mixture of exponential, Erlang, and mixture of Erlang distributions. We derive the ruin probability formulas with the use of change-of-measure technique and present important special cases. We illustrate the usefulness of the introduced model by fitting it to the real-world loss data. With the use of statistical tests and graphical tools, we show that the mixture of Erlangs is well-fitted to the data and is superior to other considered distributions. This justifies the fact that the presented results can be useful in the context of risk assessment of co-operating insurance companies.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文将前人在按比例再保险合同下呈现的保险公司-再保险公司模型的破产概率推广到了描述索赔金额的包括指数、指数混合、Erlang和Erlang混合分布的相位类型分布。我们采用改变量的技术推导了破产概率公式，并提出了重要的特殊情况。我们通过将其拟合到实际损失数据中来说明引入的模型的实用性。我们利用统计检验和图形工具展示了Erlang混合分布与其他考虑的分布相比更能很好地拟合数据，这证明了提出的结果可以在协作保险公司的风险评估方面具有实用价值。",
