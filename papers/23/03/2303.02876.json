    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于元启发式条件神经网络的方法，旨在识别高不规则潜能能量面上的物理有趣的稳态。为了展示这种方法的工作原理，我们使用从密度泛函理论计算的参数基础上建立的古典微观旋转哈密顿量对Pd / Fe / Ir（111）系统中的拓扑电荷$Q$值从1到$-13$的自旋结构进行了分析 。为了促进相关自旋结构的收集，我们利用了最新开发的“任意分段模型”（SAM）。并使用有限温度自旋动力学模拟进一步分析了Q值范围从$-3$到$-6$的自旋结构。我们发现，对于高达20K的温度，预测寿命长达200ps以上，当这些结构衰减时，新的拓扑旋转结构就会形成。我们还发现，自旋结构的相对稳定性与其拓扑相关。",

The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is introduced to facilitate the collection of relevant spin textures."
