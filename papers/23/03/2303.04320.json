    "translated_abstract": "随着个人机器人的可用性和价格的增加，它们将不再局限于大型公司仓库或工厂，而是预计将在较不受控制的环境中与更大的人群一起工作。除了确保安全和效率外，最重要的是减少机器人对人类可能产生的负面心理影响，并在这些情况下遵守未书写的社交规范。我们的研究旨在开发一个模型，可以预测拥挤环境中行人和感知社交群体的移动。我们引入了一种新的社交群组长短期记忆（SG-LSTM）模型，使用具有社交意识的LSTM来对密集环境中的人群和互动进行建模，以产生更准确的轨迹预测。我们的方法可以使导航算法在拥挤环境中更快、更准确地计算无碰撞路径。此外，我们还发布了一个带有标记行人群体的大型视频数据集。",
