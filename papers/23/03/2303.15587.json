    "title": "Linguistically Informed ChatGPT Prompts to Enhance Japanese-Chinese Machine Translation: A Case Study on Attributive Clauses. (arXiv:2303.15587v1 [cs.CL])",
    "abstract": "In the field of Japanese-Chinese translation linguistics, the issue of correctly translating attributive clauses has persistently proven to be challenging. Present-day machine translation tools often fail to accurately translate attributive clauses from Japanese to Chinese. In light of this, this paper investigates the linguistic problem underlying such difficulties, namely how does the semantic role of the modified noun affect the selection of translation patterns for attributive clauses, from a linguistic perspective. To ad-dress these difficulties, a pre-edit scheme is proposed, which aims to enhance the accuracy of translation. Furthermore, we propose a novel two-step prompt strategy, which combines this pre-edit scheme with ChatGPT, currently the most widely used large language model. This prompt strategy is capable of optimizing translation input in zero-shot scenarios and has been demonstrated to improve the average translation accuracy score by over 35%.",

    "translated_abstract": "在日中翻译语言学领域中，正确翻译定语从句一直是具有挑战性的问题。目前的机器翻译工具经常无法准确地将日语的定语从句翻译为中文，本文从语言学角度探讨了产生这种困难的语言问题，即受修饰名词的语义角色如何影响定语从句的翻译模式选择。为解决这些困难，本文提出了一种预编辑方案，旨在提高翻译准确性。此外，我们提出了一种新的两步提示策略，将这种预编辑方案与 ChatGPT 相结合，ChatGPT 是目前最广泛使用的大语言模型。该提示策略能够在零-shot场景下优化翻译输入，并已经证明可以将平均翻译准确性得分提高超过35％。",
