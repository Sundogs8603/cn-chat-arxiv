    "translated_abstract": "开放式无线接入网络(O-RAN)架构利用机器学习算法提供了一种成本有效和可扩展的优化网络的解决方案。该架构的开放接口实现了网络功能虚拟化，使O-RAN成为主要的用户通信设备。然而，有限的频率资源和信息爆炸使得在没有有效的流量控制或资源分配的情况下实现最佳的网络体验变得困难。为了解决这个问题，我们考虑进行基于移动性的负载均衡来均匀地分布网络负载，避免由单个开放式分布式单元(O-DU)管辖的开放式无线单元(O-RU)上过度聚集的负载导致网络拥塞和用户故障。我们提出了一种多智能体多臂赌博机方法来实现负载均衡和资源分配(mmLBRA)方案，旨在实现负载均衡和提高O-RAN网络的有效总和速率性能。",
