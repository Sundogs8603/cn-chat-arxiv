    "translated_abstract": "基于引用的信息检索方法已经被证明可以在需要引用大量文献的学术学科中有效地进行作弊检测或文献推荐系统等信息检索应用。在科学、技术、工程和数学领域，研究人员通常通过公式符号来引用先前的知识。我们的长期目标是将基于引用的信息检索方法推广，并将其应用于经典参考文献和数学概念。本文提出了如何引用数学公式，并定义了一个“公式概念检索任务”，其中包括公式概念发现（Formula Concept Discovery，FCD）和公式概念识别（Formula Concept Recognition，FCR）两个子任务。FCD旨在定义和探索命名为绑定等效表示的“公式概念”，而FCR旨在将给定的公式匹配到先前分配的唯一数学概念标识符上。我们提出了基于机器学习的方法来解决这两个任务，并在一个arXiv子集的1.8M个公式出现中评估了我们的模型。我们的结果显示，我们提出的方法优于强基线，并为科学文献中的数学概念的自动识别和发现提供了有希望的步骤。",
