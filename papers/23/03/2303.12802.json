    "abstract": "With the ever-improving computing capabilities and storage capacities of mobile devices in line with evolving telecommunication network paradigms, there has been an explosion of research interest towards exploring Distributed Learning (DL) frameworks to realize stringent key performance indicators (KPIs) that are expected in next-generation/6G cellular networks. In conjunction with Edge Computing, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as the DL architecture of choice in prominent wireless applications. This article lays an outline of how DL in general and FL-based strategies specifically can contribute towards realizing a part of the 6G vision and strike a balance between communication and computing constraints. As a practical use case, we apply Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) within the FL framework to the Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) problem and present preliminary evaluation results. Top contemporary challenges in applying DL approaches to 6G networks are also highlighted.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着移动设备的计算能力和存储能力不断提高，并配合不断进化的电信网络范式，人们不断探索分布式学习（DL）框架，以实现下一代/6G蜂窝网络中所期望的严格基本性能指标（KPI）。在边缘计算的协作下，联邦学习（FL）已经成为杰出无线应用中的DL 架构选择。本文概述了DL框架，特别是基于FL策略，如何有助于实现6G愿景的一部分，并在通信和计算约束之间取得平衡。作为一个实际应用的案例，我们在FL框架内应用了多智能体强化学习（MARL）到动态频谱访问（DSA）问题，并呈现了初步的评估结果。同时本文还强调了将DL方法应用于6G网络时所面临的当前挑战。",
