    "abstract": "We introduce a new optimization algorithm, termed contrastive adjustment, for learning Markov transition kernels whose stationary distribution matches the data distribution. Contrastive adjustment is not restricted to a particular family of transition distributions and can be used to model data in both continuous and discrete state spaces. Inspired by recent work on noise-annealed sampling, we propose a particular transition operator, the noise kernel, that can trade mixing speed for sample fidelity. We show that contrastive adjustment is highly valuable in human-computer design processes, as the stationarity of the learned Markov chain enables local exploration of the data manifold and makes it possible to iteratively refine outputs by human feedback. We compare the performance of noise kernels trained with contrastive adjustment to current state-of-the-art generative models and demonstrate promising results on a variety of image synthesis tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种新的优化算法，称为对比调整，用于学习 Markov 转移核，使其稳态分布与数据分布相匹配。对比调整不受限于特定的转移分布家族，并且可以用于建模连续和离散状态空间中的数据。受到最近关于噪声退火采样的工作的启发，我们提出了特定的转移算子，即噪声核，可以在交换速度与样本保真度之间进行权衡。我们发现对比调整在人机设计流程中非常有价值，因为所学的 Markov 链的不变性使得可以对数据流形进行局部探索，并使得可以通过人类反馈来迭代地改进输出。我们将使用对比调整训练的噪声核的性能与当前最先进的生成模型进行比较，并展示在各种图像合成任务中的有 promising 的结果。",
