    "translated_abstract": "目前，行走或奔跑在各种复杂地形上已经取得了显著的进步。然而，与狗等生物相比，机器人四足动物仍然远远落后，狗能够展示多种敏捷技能，并能使用腿部超出运动的范围，执行几个基本的操纵任务，如与物体进行交互和攀爬。在这篇论文中，我们通过训练四足机器人不仅行走，还使用前肢攀爬墙壁、按下按钮、在现实世界中执行物体交互等任务，来缩小这一差距。为了处理这一具有挑战性的优化问题，我们将技能广泛分为两类：运动，包括任何涉及运动的事物，无论是通过行走还是攀爬墙壁；操纵，涉及使用一条腿进行交互，同时保持其他三条腿的平衡。利用课程学习在模拟环境中训练这些技能，并使用我们提出的 sim2real 方法将其转移到真实环境中。我们的实验表明，我们的方法使得四足机器人能够在保持稳定的同时执行多种操纵任务，如打开门、按下按钮和提起物品。",
