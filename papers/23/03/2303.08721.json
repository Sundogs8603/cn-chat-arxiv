    "translated_abstract": "说服是人类的重要特征之一，是商业、政治等事业的核心。人工智能（AI）的进步已经产生了能够说服人类购买产品、观看视频、点击搜索结果等的AI系统。即使没有明确设计为说服的系统，在实践中也可能会这样做。未来，越来越具有人形特征的AI系统可能会与用户形成持续的关系，提高它们的说服力。本文探讨了具有不确定性的AI系统的说服能力未来。我们考虑到AI如何在移动说服力平衡的基础上，实现定制化的说服，为虚假信息带来动力以及改变人类塑造自身言论的方式。我们考虑AI驱动的说服方式可能与人类驱动的方式有所不同。我们警告说，普遍存在高度说服力的AI系统可能对人类的自主权和福祉产生负面影响，并呼吁加强关于其开发和使用的对话和监管。",

Negative consequences for human autonomy and well-being are warned, with a call for increased regulation around their development and deployment."
