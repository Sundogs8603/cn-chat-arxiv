    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an increasing amount of dialogue/conversation on the web especially on social media. That inspires the development of dialogue-based retrieval, in which retrieving videos based on dialogue is of increasing interest for recommendation systems. Different from other video retrieval tasks, dialogue-to-video retrieval uses structured queries in the form of user-generated dialogue as the search descriptor. We present a novel dialogue-to-video retrieval system, incorporating structured conversational information. Experiments conducted on the AVSD dataset show that our proposed approach using plain-text queries improves over the previous counterpart model by 15.8% on R@1. Furthermore, our approach using dialogue as a query, improves retrieval performance by 4.2%, 6.2%, 8.6% on R@1, R@5 and R@10 and outperforms the state-of-the-art model by 0.7%, 3.6% and 6.0% on R@1, R@5 and R@10 respectively.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，在社交媒体等网络平台上，人们进行着越来越多的对话。这启发了基于对话的检索的发展，其中基于对话的视频检索对于推荐系统具有越来越大的兴趣。不同于其他视频检索任务，对话到视频检索使用以用户生成的对话为搜索描述符的结构化查询。本文提出了一个新颖的基于对话的视频检索系统，融合了结构化的对话信息。在AVSD数据集上进行的实验表明，我们提出的使用纯文本查询的方法在R@1上比以前的模型提高了15.8%。此外，我们使用对话作为查询的方法，在R@1、R@5和R@10上分别提高了4.2%、6.2%和8.6%，在R@1、R@5和R@10上分别比基准模型提高了0.7%、3.6%和6.0%。",
