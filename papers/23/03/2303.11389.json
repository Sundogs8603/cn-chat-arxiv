    "translated_abstract": "航空场景分类是一项具有挑战性的遥感任务，旨在为一组预定义的类别（例如农业、海滩和港口）对遥感图像进行语义标签。由于数据集图像中所包含的对象具有不同的尺度和方向，因此该任务具有高度的类内变化。在遥感领域中，CNN架构的使用是场景分类任务的替代解决方案。通常，这些CNN被用于执行传统的图像分类任务。然而，另一个不太常用的远程感知图像分类方法可能是使用深度度量学习（DML）方法。因此，本文提出了使用六种DML方法进行航空场景分类任务的方法，并分析它们与四种不同的预训练CNN的行为，通过进化计算算法（UMDA）将它们进行结合。通过实验可观察到，DML方法可以达到与传统图像分类方法相竞争的精度，特别是当它们通过进化计算算法结合时。",
