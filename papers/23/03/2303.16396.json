    "translated_abstract": "超速驾驶是交通事故中的主要因素之一。各个交通部门已提出速度管理策略，以减少主干道上的超速行驶。虽然已有许多关于分析超速比例的研究，但很少研究考虑了超速行为对个人旅程的影响。许多研究所利用的探测器速度数据有限，无法了解驾驶员所采取的路径信息。本研究旨在探究给定旅程中个人经历的各种道路特征对超速比例的影响。利用连接车辆轨迹数据确定驾驶员所采取的路径，以及与车辆相关的变量。使用多个学习模型预测超速比例的水平。表现最佳的模型为极端梯度提升，准确度为0.756。我们的研究有助于深入了解道路特征对个人超速行为的影响，并为制定更有效的速度管理策略提供参考。",
