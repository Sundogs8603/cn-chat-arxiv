    "translated_abstract": "心电图合成是一种研究领域，旨在生成逼真的合成心电信号以供医疗使用，无需担心注释成本或临床数据隐私限制。传统的心电图生成模型只考虑单个心电信号，并使用基于GAN的生成模型。这些模型只能生成单导联样本，并要求每个诊断分类进行单独的培训。心电图的诊断分类无法捕捉心电图之间的复杂差异，这些差异取决于各种特征（例如患者人口统计学细节，共存的诊断分类等）。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一个文本到心电图任务，其中使用文本输入生成心电图输出。然后，我们首次提出了一个自回归生成模型Auto-TTE，它是一个基于临床文本报告条件的生成模型，用于合成12导联心电图。我们将我们的模型与文本到语音和文本到心电图领域的其他代表性模型进行了比较。结果表明，我们提出的方法在文本到心电图合成方面的表现优于最先进的模型。",
