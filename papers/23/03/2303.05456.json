    "translated_abstract": "最近由于其出色的合成质量，去噪扩散模型（DDMs）越来越受到关注。DDMs建立在将数据推向噪声分布的扩散过程上，模型学习去噪。在本文中，我们建立了DDMs在图像修复（IR）方面的解释。整合IR文献使我们可以使用替代目标和多样的前向过程，而不仅局限于扩散过程。通过在基于MAP估计的损失函数上施加先验知识，我们消除了DDMs中昂贵的采样的需求。此外，我们提出了多尺度训练，通过利用前向过程的灵活性，提高了性能。实验结果表明，我们的模型提高了训练和推断的质量和效率。此外，我们展示了我们的模型在反问题上的适用性。我们相信，我们的框架铺平了快速图像合成和修复的道路。",
