    "abstract": "ChatGPT is built on a large language model trained on an enormous corpus of human text to emulate human conversation. Despite lacking any explicit programming regarding the laws of physics, recent work by Kortemeyer (2023) has demonstrated that ChatGPT-3.5 could pass an introductory physics course at some nominal level and register something close to a minimal understanding of Newtonian Mechanics on the Force Concept Inventory. This work replicates those results and also demonstrates that the latest version, ChatGPT-4, has reached a much higher mark in the latter context. Indeed, its responses come quite close to perfectly demonstrating expert-level competence, with a few very notable exceptions and limitations.

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT是建立在一个巨大的人类文本信息库上的大型语言模型，以模拟人类对话。最近Kortemeyer（2023）的研究表明，尽管没有任何关于物理定律的明确编程指导，ChatGPT-3.5可以通过一些名义水平的入门物理课程，并在力学的力概念测试中得到接近最小理解的成绩。本研究复制了这些结果，并证明了最新版本ChatGPT-4在该环境下的成绩远高于前版本，在一些非常值得注意的例外和限制条件下，其回答非常接近于完美地展示专家水平的能力。我们简要评述了这对于未来物理教育和教学的含义。",
    "tldr": "ChatGPT-4是一个基于大规模语言模型训练的对话机器人，能达到接近于物理专家水平的力概念测试成绩，对未来的物理教育和教学有重要意义。",
    "en_tdlr": "ChatGPT-4, a conversational robot based on a large-scale language model, achieved a physics force concept test score close to that of an expert despite lacking any explicit programming regarding the laws of physics, suggesting important implications for future physics education and pedagogy."
