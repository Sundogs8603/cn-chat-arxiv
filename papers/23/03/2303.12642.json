    "abstract": "Numerous parties are calling for the democratisation of AI, but the phrase is used to refer to a variety of goals, the pursuit of which sometimes conflict. This paper identifies four kinds of AI democratisation that are commonly discussed: (1) the democratisation of AI use, (2) the democratisation of AI development, (3) the democratisation of AI profits, and (4) the democratisation of AI governance. Numerous goals and methods of achieving each form of democratisation are discussed. The main takeaway from this paper is that AI democratisation is a multifarious and sometimes conflicting concept that should not be conflated with improving AI accessibility. If we want to move beyond ambiguous commitments to democratising AI, to productive discussions of concrete policies and trade-offs, then we need to recognise the principal role of the democratisation of AI governance in navigating tradeoffs and risks across decisions around use, development, and profits.",

    "translated_title": "智能化的民主化：多种含义、目标和方法",
    "translated_abstract": "许多人呼吁实现AI的民主化，但这个词语用来指代多种目标，有时会相互冲突。本文确定了通常讨论的四种AI民主化类型：(1) AI使用的民主化，(2) AI开发的民主化，(3) AI利润的民主化，和(4) AI治理的民主化。本文讨论了实现每种民主化形式的多个目标和方法。从本文中主要得出的结论是，AI的民主化是一个多元而有时会相互冲突的概念，不应混淆AI可访问性的改善。如果我们想要超越对智能化民主化的模糊承诺，进入具体政策和权衡的生产性讨论，我们需要认识到AI治理的民主化在跨越关于使用、开发和利润的决策中导航权衡和风险的主要作用。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文探讨了AI的民主化，包括四种类型的民主化：AI使用的民主化，AI开发的民主化，AI利润的民主化，和AI治理的民主化。要想实现有效的政策和权衡讨论，需要认识到AI治理的民主化在决策中扮演着重要的角色。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the democratisation of AI, including four types: democratisation of AI use, development, profits, and governance. To achieve effective policy and trade-off discussions, it is essential to recognise the significant role of democratisation of AI governance in decision-making."
