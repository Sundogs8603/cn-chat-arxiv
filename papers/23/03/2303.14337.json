Automated generation of situation reports can significantly reduce the time, effort, and cost for domain experts when preparing their official human-curated reports. However, AI research toward this goal has been very limited, and no successful trials have yet been conducted to automate such report generation. We propose SmartBook, a novel task formulation targeting situation report generation, which consumes large volumes of news data to produce a structured situation report with multiple hypotheses (claims) summarized and grounded with rich links to factual evidence.

    "translated_abstract": "新兴事件，如COVID疫情和乌克兰危机，需要时间敏感的全面了解情况，以便进行适当的决策和有效的行动响应。自动生成情报报告可以大大减少领域专家准备官方人工策划报告的时间、精力和成本。然而，AI研究在这个目标方面非常有限，还没有成功的试验来自动化这种报告生成。我们提出了SmartBook，一种新颖的任务分解，旨在生成情况报告，在大量新闻数据的基础上生成一个结构化的情况报告，其中包含多个假设（主张），并与事实依据建立丰富的关联。我们通过自动生成情报分析报告来实现SmartBook，以协助专家分析师处理乌克兰-俄罗斯危机。机器生成的报告以时间轴的形式结构化，每个事件都与相关的演员、位置和因果关系相关联。我们的评估显示，SmartBook可以显著减少报告时间，并通过生成比人类同行更全面、准确和一致的报告来提高报告质量。",
