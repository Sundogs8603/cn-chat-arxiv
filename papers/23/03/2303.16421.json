    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs），如ChatGPT和GPT-4，在NLP方面取得了重大进展。然而，它们记忆、表达和利用常识知识的能力一直是LLMs的一个众所周知的痛点。目前仍不清楚以下几点：（1）GPT能否有效回答常识问题？（2）GPT对常识知识是否精通？（3）GPT是否了解用于回答特定问题的底层常识知识？（4）GPT能否有效利用常识回答问题？为了评估以上常识问题，我们进行了一系列实验来评估ChatGPT的常识能力，实验结果表明：(1) GPT在常识任务中能够获得良好的问答准确性，但仍然无法解决某些类型的问题。(2) ChatGPT具有学识渊博，可以使用知识提示准确地产生大部分常识知识。(3)尽管具有知识，ChatGPT是一个缺乏经验的常识问题求解器，无法有效地利用常识知识回答某些问题。",
