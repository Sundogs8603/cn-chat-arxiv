    "abstract": "The debate about the concept of the so called right to explanation in AI is the subject of a wealth of literature. It has focused, in the legal scholarship, on art. 22 GDPR and, in the technical scholarship, on techniques that help explain the output of a certain model (XAI). The purpose of this work is to investigate if the new provisions introduced by the proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (AI Act), in combination with Convention 108 plus and GDPR, are enough to indicate the existence of a right to technical explainability in the EU legal framework and, if not, whether the EU should include it in its current legislation. This is a preliminary work submitted to the online event organised by the Information Society Law Center and it will be later developed into a full paper.",

    "translated_abstract": "AI的解释权问题涉及大量文献的讨论。在法律学者中，集中于《通用数据保护条例》中的第22条；在技术学者中，集中于能够帮助解释某个模型输出的技术（XAI）上。本文旨在调查《AI法案》中引入的新规定与《108公约》和《通用数据保护条例》相结合是否足以表明在欧盟的法律框架中存在技术可解释性权利，如果不是，则欧盟是否应将其包含在其现行立法中。",
