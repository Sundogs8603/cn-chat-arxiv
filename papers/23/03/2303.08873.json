    "translated_abstract": "异构架构已成为构建高性能计算系统的主流设计选择。但是，异构架构对于实现可执行性的性能可移植性提出了重大挑战。将程序调整到新异构平台上是耗时费力的，需要开发人员手动探索大量执行参数空间。为解决这些挑战，本文提出了新的OpenMP扩展，以实现自主的、机器学习驱动的自适应。我们的解决方案包括一组新颖的语言结构、编译器转换和运行时支持。我们提出了一种生产者消费者模式来灵活地定义多个不同变体的OpenMP代码区域以实现自适应。这些区域在运行时透明地进行分析，自主学习优化的机器学习模型来动态地选择最快的变体。我们的方法显著降低了用户在异构体系结构上编程自适应应用的工作量。",
