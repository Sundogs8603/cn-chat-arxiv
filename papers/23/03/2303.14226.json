    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一个包含N个异质单位和p个干预的设置。 我们的目标是学习任意组合的单位特定潜在结果，即N×2 ^ p个因果参数。在许多应用程序中自然出现了选择干预组合的问题，例如因子设计试验，推荐引擎(例如，为用户显示最大程度的参与度的一组电影)，医学中的组合疗法，选择ML模型的重要特征等等。当N和p增长时，进行N×2 ^ p个实验来估计各种参数是不可行的。而且，观测数据很可能存在混杂，即单位是否在组合下出现与其在该组合下的潜在结果相关。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的模型，它在单位和组合之间都施加了潜在结构。我们假设单位之间存在潜在的相似性(即类似单位的潜在结果是相似的)，并且组合之间也存在潜在的相似性(即类似组合的效果是相似的)。我们使用层次贝叶斯非参数模型来形式化这一点，该模型联合聚类单元和组合，并且足够灵活，可以模拟连续或离散结果。我们在模拟和实际数据上演示了所提出的方法，并表明它可以显着减少学习因果参数所需的实验数量。",
