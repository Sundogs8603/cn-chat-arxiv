    "abstract": "This paper presents a model with the aim to follow, as closely as possible, the rationale of the macroeconomic model advanced by J.M. Keynes in his famous \"The General Theory of Unemployment, Interest and Money\", in order to provide a viable tool for macroeconomic research. Keynes' main result will be shown, i.e., to determine the level of income and employment starting from the marginal efficiency of capital and the marginal propensity to consume, given the interest rate. Elements of the model will be described by referring to the original text. The sequentiality in model operation will prove quintessential in order to describe the complex nature of macroeconomic systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个模型，旨在尽可能地遵循J.M.凯恩斯在他著名的《失业、利率和货币的一般理论》中提出的宏观经济模型的基本原理，以提供一个可行的宏观经济研究工具。将展示凯恩斯的主要成果，即从资本边际效益和倾向于消费的边际倾向开始，在给定利率的情况下确定收入和就业水平。模型的要素将通过参考原始文本进行描述。模型操作中的顺序性将证明在描述宏观经济系统的复杂性时必不可少。",
