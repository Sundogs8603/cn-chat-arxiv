    "abstract": "Our vision paper outlines a plan to improve the future of semantic interoperability in data spaces through the application of machine learning. The use of data spaces, where data is exchanged among members in a self-regulated environment, is becoming increasingly popular. However, the current manual practices of managing metadata and vocabularies in these spaces are time-consuming, prone to errors, and may not meet the needs of all stakeholders. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we believe that semantic interoperability in data spaces can be significantly improved. This involves automatically generating and updating metadata, which results in a more flexible vocabulary that can accommodate the diverse terminologies used by different sub-communities. Our vision for the future of data spaces addresses the limitations of conventional data exchange and makes data more accessible and valuable for all members of the community.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们的这篇论文阐述了一种通过应用机器学习改善数据空间中语义互操作性的计划。数据空间，即数据在自我管理的环境中在成员之间交换日益受到欢迎。然而，当前在这些空间中管理元数据和词汇的手动实践耗时且容易出错，且可能无法满足所有利益相关者的需求。通过利用机器学习的力量，我们相信可以显著提高数据空间中的语义互操作性。这涉及自动生成和更新元数据，从而产生更灵活的词汇，以适应不同子群体使用的多样化术语。我们对数据空间未来的愿景解决了传统数据交换的局限性，使数据对社区所有成员更具可访问性和价值。",
