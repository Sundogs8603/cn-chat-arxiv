    "translated_abstract": "人物对于任何故事的情节都是至关重要的。在撰写故事之前建立人物可以提高情节的清晰度和整体叙事的流畅性。然而，以往关于视觉叙事的研究往往聚焦于在图像中检测物体并发现它们之间的关系。在这种方法中，当人物进入生成管道时不会与其他物体区分。结果是一个连贯的事件序列，而不是以角色为中心的故事。为了解决这种限制，我们介绍了 VIST-Character 数据集，该数据集提供了丰富的以角色为中心的注释，包括视觉和文本共指链和角色的重要性评级。基于此数据集，我们提出了两个新任务：重要人物检测和视觉故事中角色的定位。针对这两个任务，我们基于分布相似性和预训练的视觉语言模型，开发了简单的无监督模型。",
