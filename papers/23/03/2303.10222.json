    "abstract": "Purpose: Cervical cancer is one of the primary causes of death in women. It should be diagnosed early and treated according to the best medical advice, as with other diseases, to ensure that its effects are as minimal as possible. Pap smear images are one of the most constructive ways for identifying this type of cancer. This study proposes a cross-attention-based Transfomer approach for the reliable classification of cervical cancer in Pap smear images. Methods: In this study, we propose the CerviFormer -- a model that depends on the Transformers and thereby requires minimal architectural assumptions about the size of the input data. The model uses a cross-attention technique to repeatedly consolidate the input data into a compact latent Transformer module, which enables it to manage very large-scale inputs. We evaluated our model on two publicly available Pap smear datasets. Results: For 3-state classification on the Sipakmed data, the model achieved an accuracy of 93.70%. For 2-stat",

    "translated_abstract": "目的：颈部癌症是女性死亡的主要原因之一。早期诊断和根据最佳医学建议进行治疗，就像其他疾病一样，以确保其影响尽可能小。 PAP检查图像是识别这种癌症最具建设性的方式之一。本研究提出了一种基于交叉注意力和Transfomer的方法，可靠地将PAP检查图像分类为颈癌。方法：在本研究中，我们提出了CerviFormer模型，该模型依赖于Transfomer，因此对于输入数据的大小仅需最小的架构假设。该模型使用交叉注意力技术，将输入数据重复汇集到一个紧凑的潜在Transformer模块中，从而使其能够管理非常大规模的输入。我们在两个公开可用的PAP检查数据集上评估了我们的模型。结果：对于Sipakmed数据的3状态分类，该模型的准确率为93.70％。对于Herlev数据集上的2状态分类，该模型的准确率为97.15％。结论：我们的研究证明了所提出的CerviFormer模型在将PAP检查图像分类为颈部癌症方面的有效性，这有助于早期检测和治疗这种致命疾病。",
