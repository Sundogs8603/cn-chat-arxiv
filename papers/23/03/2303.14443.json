    "abstract": "The number of papers submitted to academic conferences is steadily rising in many scientific disciplines. To handle this growth, systems for automatic paper-reviewer assignments are increasingly used during the reviewing process. These systems use statistical topic models to characterize the content of submissions and automate the assignment to reviewers. In this paper, we show that this automation can be manipulated using adversarial learning. We propose an attack that adapts a given paper so that it misleads the assignment and selects its own reviewers. Our attack is based on a novel optimization strategy that alternates between the feature space and problem space to realize unobtrusive changes to the paper. To evaluate the feasibility of our attack, we simulate the paper-reviewer assignment of an actual security conference (IEEE S&P) with 165 reviewers on the program committee. Our results show that we can successfully select and remove reviewers without access to the assignment sys",

    "translated_abstract": "许多学科的学术会议所提交的论文数量逐渐增加，为了处理这种增长，在审查过程中越来越多地使用自动论文审稿人分配系统。这些系统使用统计主题模型来表征提交内容，并自动分配给审稿人。本文表明，这种自动化可以通过对抗性学习进行操作。我们提出了一种攻击，使特定论文可以误导评审并选择自己的评审人。我们的攻击基于一种新的优化策略，交替使用特征空间和问题空间来实现对论文的不明显更改。为了评估我们的攻击的可行性，我们模拟了一个真实的安全会议（IEEE S&P）的论文审稿人分配，其中有165名审稿人在项目委员会审核。我们的结果表明，我们可以成功选择并删除审稿人，而无需访问分配系统的参数，并且我们的攻击可以在保持不被发现的情况下实现超过80％的成功率。",
    "tldr": "本文通过对抗性学习破解了自动论文审稿人分配系统，实现了对论文的不明显更改，进而可以成功选择和删除审稿人，攻击成功率达80％以上。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper shows that automatic paper-reviewer assignment systems can be manipulated using adversarial learning, proposing an attack that misleads the assignment and selects its own reviewers. By alternating between feature space and problem space, unobtrusive changes can be made to the paper to achieve a success rate of over 80% while remaining undetected. They simulate the paper-reviewer assignment of an actual security conference and successfully select and remove reviewers without accessing the assignment system's parameters."
