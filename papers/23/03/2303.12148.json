    "translated_abstract": "头部MRI预处理涉及将原始图像转换为在标准坐标空间中的强度归一化、去除头骨的大脑。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为神经预处理（NPP）的端到端弱监督学习方法，通过神经网络同时解决所有三个子任务，该网络在大型数据集上进行训练，不需要单独的子任务监督。由于总体目标高度不完全约束，我们明确分离了保持几何形状的强度映射（去除头骨和强度归一化）和空间转换（空间归一化）。定量结果表明，我们的模型优于只解决单个子任务的最新方法。我们的消融实验证明了我们选择NPP架构设计的重要性。此外，NPP允许用户在推断时灵活控制每个任务。代码和模型可在\\url{https://github.com/Novestars/Neu}上免费获取。",
