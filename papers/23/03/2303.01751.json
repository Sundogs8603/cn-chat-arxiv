    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a new computational framework, the DMSB, which can learn smooth measure-valued splines for stochastic systems that satisfy position marginal constraints across time. It is used to solve high-dimensional multi-marginal trajectory inference tasks and outperforms baselines significantly in experiments. Moreover, the framework provides a general framework for solving stochastic trajectory reconstruction tasks with various types of marginal constraints."
