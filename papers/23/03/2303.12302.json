    "translated_abstract": "深度生成学习不仅可用于生成统计特征源于输入数据的新数据，还可以通过根据重构质量将原本数据分为正常和异常实例，用于异常检测。本文探讨了三种无监督深度生成模型（具有高斯、伯努利和玻尔兹曼先验的变分自编码器（VAE））在商业飞行的飞行操作数据上检测异常的性能。我们制定了两种具有离散潜变量的VAE模型，一种具有分解伯努利先验，一种具有限制玻尔兹曼机作为先验，因为机器学习应用需要离散变量模型，而基于双态量子系统的量子设备要求该模型。使用RBM先验的DVAE在航空中的多元时间序列数据异常检测中有显著优异性能。我们的实验结果表明，与分解伯努利先验的DVAE、正常的高斯VAE和基于Mahalanobis距离的经典方法相比，使用RBM先验的DVAE具有更优秀的性能。",
