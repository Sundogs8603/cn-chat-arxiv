    "abstract": "Despite the widespread adoption of recommender systems by online investment platforms, empirical research into their impact on online investors' behaviors is scarce. Using data from a global e-commerce platform, the authors of this study adopt a regression discontinuity design to causally examine the effects of recommender systems on online investor behaviors, specifically in a mutual fund investment context. The results show that funds featured by recommender systems prompt significantly more purchases. This effect is especially salient among unsophisticated investors, who appear more likely to follow system-provided recommendations. Further analysis also reveals that these investors tend to suffer significantly worse investment performance after purchasing the recommended funds. Thus, recommender systems threaten to amplify wealth inequality among investors in financial markets.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管在线投资平台广泛采用了推荐系统，但对其对在线投资者行为的影响进行的实证研究很少。本研究使用来自全球电子商务平台的数据，采用回归不连续设计，从因果角度研究了推荐系统对在线投资者行为的影响，特别是在共同基金投资方面。研究结果表明，由推荐系统推荐的基金会显著促进更多的购买行为。这种影响在不成熟的投资者中尤为明显，他们似乎更容易遵循系统提供的建议。进一步的分析还揭示了，这些投资者倾向于在购买推荐基金后遭受显著更糟糕的投资绩效。因此，推荐系统可能会加剧金融市场投资者之间的财富不平等。",
