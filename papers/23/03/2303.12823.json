    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了面对复合攻击（包括拒绝服务攻击和执行攻击）的不确定和非线性多智能体系统的领导者从属一致性。通过添加数字双胞胎层（TL，受最近数字双胞胎技术的启发）来构建双层控制框架。因此，对抗复合攻击的弹性控制任务被分为两部分：一部分是针对TL上的DoS攻击的分布式估计，另一部分是对抗CPL上的执行攻击的弹性分布式跟踪控制。数据驱动方案用于处理模型非线性和模型不确定性，其中整个控制过程只使用系统的输入和输出数据。首先，基于切换估计规律的分布式观测器被设计用于在TL上针对DoS攻击。其次，基于双生层的分布式无模型自适应控制（DMFAC）协议被提出，用于每个智能体在CPL上处理AAs。仿真结果显示了所提出方法的有效性。",
