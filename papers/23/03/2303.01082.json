    "abstract": "Most of the existing clustering methods are based on a single granularity of information, such as the distance and density of each data. This most fine-grained based approach is usually inefficient and susceptible to noise. Therefore, we propose a clustering algorithm that combines multi-granularity Granular-Ball and minimum spanning tree (MST). We construct coarsegrained granular-balls, and then use granular-balls and MST to implement the clustering method based on \"large-scale priority\", which can greatly avoid the influence of outliers and accelerate the construction process of MST. Experimental results on several data sets demonstrate the power of the algorithm. All codes have been released at https://github.com/xjnine/GBMST.",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数现有的聚类方法都基于单一粒度的信息，如每个数据的距离和密度。这种最细粒度的方法通常效率低下且容易受到噪声的影响。因此，我们提出了一种聚类算法，它结合了多粒度颗粒球和最小生成树(MST)。我们构建了粗粒度颗粒球，然后使用颗粒球和MST实现基于“大规模优先级”的聚类方法，可以大大避免异常值的影响，并加快了MST的构建过程。在几个数据集上的实验结果证明了该算法的效果。所有代码已在https://github.com/xjnine/GBMST发布。",
