    "abstract": "This White Paper sets out to explain the value that metamodelling can bring to air traffic management (ATM) research. It will define metamodelling and explore what it can, and cannot, do. The reader is assumed to have basic knowledge of SESAR: the Single European Sky ATM Research project. An important element of SESAR, as the technological pillar of the Single European Sky initiative, is to bring about improvements, as measured through specific key performance indicators (KPIs), and as implemented by a series of so-called SESAR 'Solutions'. These 'Solutions' are new or improved operational procedures or technologies, designed to meet operational and performance improvements described in the European ATM Master Plan.",
