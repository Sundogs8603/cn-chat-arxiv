    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种名为数据集增强的策略，一次性改进数据集，从而提高任何经过增强的数据集训练的模型的准确性，对用户没有额外的训练成本。我们提出了一种基于数据增强和知识蒸馏的数据集增强策略。我们的通用策略是基于广泛的CNN和基于transformer的模型的分析，以及对带有各种数据增强的最先进模型进行大规模的蒸馏研究。我们创建了ImageDataNet+的增强版本，以及增强的数据集CIFAR-100+，Flowers-102+和Food-101+。使用ImageDataNet+训练的模型更准确、更有鲁棒性和校准性，并且对下游任务（例如分割和检测）具有很好的迁移能力。例如，ResNet-50在ImageNet验证集上的准确率提高了1.7％，在ImageNetV2上提高了3.5％，在ImageNet-R上提高了10.0％。在ImageDataNet+上测量的Expected Calibration Error（ECE）也有显著改进。",
