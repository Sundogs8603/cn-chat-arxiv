    "abstract": "Image-to-image reconstruction problems with free or inexpensive metadata in the form of class labels appear often in biological and medical image domains. Existing text-guided or style-transfer image-to-image approaches do not translate to datasets where additional information is provided as discrete classes. We introduce and implement a model which combines image-to-image and class-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic models. We train our model on a real-world dataset of microscopy images used for drug discovery, with and without incorporating metadata labels. By exploring the properties of image-to-image diffusion with relevant labels, we show that class-guided image-to-image diffusion can improve the meaningful content of the reconstructed images and outperform the unguided model in useful downstream tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "在生物医学图像领域，常常出现带有自由或廉价元数据形式的类别标签的图像重建问题。现有的文本引导或风格转移图像重建方法无法转化为提供离散类别的数据集。我们介绍并实现了一种模型，可将图像至图像和类别引导去噪扩散概率模型组合。我们使用真实世界的显微镜图像数据集进行训练，有和没有元数据标签。通过探索具有相关标签的图像至图像扩散的属性，我们展示了类别引导的图像至图像扩散可以提高重建图像的有意义内容，并在有用的下游任务中优于未引导的模型。",
