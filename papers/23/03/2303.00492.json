    "translated_abstract": "由于图神经网络(GNN)能够处理图结构数据，因此在现实世界的网络应用和系统中广泛使用。然而，对数据隐私的日益关注严重挑战了传统的集中式模型训练范式，其中服务器持有所有图信息。联邦学习是一种新兴的协作计算范式，可以在不集中数据的情况下进行模型训练。现有的联邦GNN研究主要集中在客户端持有不同的图或子图的系统上。然而，还没有对每个客户端仅知道其直接邻居的实际节点级联邦情况进行研究。在本文中，我们提出了第一个支持节点级联邦图的有监督和无监督学习的联邦GNN框架Lumos，它具有特征和度数保护功能。我们首先设计了一个树构造器，以提高在有限结构信息下的表示能力。我们还提出了一种基于邻居信息的去中心化节点聚合策略。",
