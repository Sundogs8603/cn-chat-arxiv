    "translated_abstract": "机器学习、分类和预测模型在各种领域都有应用。运动分析是其中一个越来越受欢迎的应用领域，但大多数现有工作都集中在主流运动的自动裁判和伤害预防上。对于其他运动，例如乒乓球，研究才刚刚开始受到更多关注。本文提出使用机器学习来预测乒乓球单打比赛的结果。我们使用球员和比赛统计数据作为特征，并通过消融研究评估它们的相对重要性。在模型方面，我们探索了许多流行的模型。我们发现，5折交叉验证和超参数调整对于提高模型性能至关重要。我们在消融研究中调查了不同的特征聚合策略，以证明模型的鲁棒性。不同模型的表现相当，结果的准确率（61-70%）与类似运动中的最新模型相匹配，例如...",
