    "translated_abstract": "交通流预测是时空分析中具有挑战性但至关重要的问题，近年来越来越受到关注。除了时空相关性，城市区域的功能性也在交通流预测中起着至关重要的作用。然而，对区域功能属性的探索主要集中在添加额外的拓扑结构上，忽略了功能属性对区域交通特征的影响。与现有作品不同的是，我们提出了一个名为POI-MetaBlock的新模块，利用每个区域的功能性（由兴趣点分布表示）作为元数据来进一步挖掘不同功能区域的不同交通特征。具体而言，所提出的POI-MetaBlock采用自注意力架构，结合POI和时间信息生成每个区域的动态注意参数，使模型能够适应不同的各种区域交通模式。",
