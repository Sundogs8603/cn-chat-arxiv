    "abstract": "Knowledge from diverse application domains is organized as knowledge graphs (KGs) that are stored in RDF engines accessible in the web via SPARQL endpoints. Expressing a well-formed SPARQL query requires information about the graph structure and the exact URIs of its components, which is impractical for the average user. Question answering (QA) systems assist by translating natural language questions to SPARQL. Existing QA systems are typically based on application-specific human-curated rules, or require prior information, expensive pre-processing and model adaptation for each targeted KG.

    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱是以RDF引擎存储的来自不同应用领域的知识。通过SPARQL端点可以在Web上访问知识图谱。为了正确表达一个符合规范的SPARQL查询，需要了解图结构和其组成部分的确切URI，这对于普通用户来说是不现实的。问答系统通过将自然语言问题转换为SPARQL来提供帮助。现有的问答系统通常基于应用特定的人工策略，或者需要先验信息、昂贵的预处理和模型调整来适配每个目标知识图谱。因此，它们很难推广到广泛的应用和知识图谱。本文提出了KGQAn，一个不需要针对每个目标知识图谱进行定制的通用问答系统。KGQAn不使用人工策略，而是将问题理解作为一个文本生成问题来进行新颖的形式化，通过神经序列到序列模型将问题转换为中间的抽象表示。",
