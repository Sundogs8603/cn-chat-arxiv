Purpose: investigating domain randomisation (DR) to increase the generalisation of a DL model for brain sCT generation. Methods: CT and corresponding T1-weighted MRI with/without contrast, T2-weighted, and FLAIR MRI from 95 patients undergoing RT were collected, considering FLAIR the unseen sequence where to investigate generalisation. A ``Baseline'' generative adversarial network was trained with/without the FLAIR sequence to test how a model performs without DR.

    "translated_abstract": "背景：已经提出并在临床上越来越受到认可的合成计算机断层扫描（sCT）以便基于磁共振成像（MRI）的放疗。深度学习（DL）最近展示了从固定MRI采集中生成准确sCT的能力。然而，MRI协议可能随着时间的推移或在不同中心之间有所不同，导致模型泛化能力差而生成低质量的sCT。目的：研究领域随机化（DR）以增加用于生成脑部sCT 的DL模型的泛化能力。方法：收集95名接受放疗的患者的CT和相应的T1加权MRI /不加对比剂，T2加权和FLAIR MRI，其中考虑FLAIR作为研究泛化的未见序列。训练了一个基准生成对抗网络，其中包括或不包括FLAIR序列以测试模型在没有DR的情况下的表现。评估了图像相似性和基于sCT的剂量计划的准确性，以选择最佳表现的DR方法。",
