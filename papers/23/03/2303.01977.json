    "abstract": "Efficient packing of items into bins is a common daily task. Known as Bin Packing Problem, it has been intensively studied in the field of artificial intelligence, thanks to the wide interest from industry and logistics. Since decades, many variants have been proposed, with the three-dimensional Bin Packing Problem as the closest one to real-world use cases. We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical framework for solving real-world three-dimensional Bin Packing Problems (Q4RealBPP), considering different realistic characteristics, such as: i) package and bin dimensions, ii) overweight restrictions, iii) affinities among item categories and iv) preferences for item ordering. Q4RealBPP permits the solving of real-world oriented instances of 3dBPP, contemplating restrictions well appreciated by industrial and logistics sectors.",

    "translated_abstract": "高效地将物品装入箱子是一项常见的日常任务，也被称为“装箱问题”。由于行业和物流领域的广泛关注，它在人工智能领域得到了广泛研究。自几十年以来，许多变种已被提出，其中三维装箱问题是最接近实际用例的一个。我们介绍了一个混合的量子-经典框架，用于解决考虑不同现实特征的三维装箱问题（Q4RealBPP），例如：（i）包装和箱子尺寸，（ii）超重限制，（iii）物品类别之间的亲和力和（iv）物品排序的偏好。Q4RealBPP允许解决考虑到工业和物流部门广泛评价的限制的3dBPP的现实导向的实例。",
