    "translated_abstract": "本论文研究生成高质量、私有合成血糖轨迹的问题，这个任务可推广到许多其他时间序列数据。现有的时间序列数据合成方法，如使用生成对抗网络（GANs）的方法，无法捕捉血糖数据的先天特征，也无法在不严重降低合成数据效用的情况下提供任何形式隐私保证。本文提出了GlucoSynth，一种新颖的保护隐私的GAN框架，可用于生成合成血糖轨迹。我们方法的核心思想是在考虑时序动态的同时，保留轨迹中motif（血糖事件）之间的关系。我们的框架采用差分隐私机制，提供了强有力的形式隐私保证。我们使用120万条血糖轨迹进行了全面评估；GlucoSynth在生成高质量合成数据方面表现优异。",
