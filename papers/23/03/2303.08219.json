    "abstract": "Our research deals with the optimization version of the set partition problem, where the objective is to minimize the absolute difference between the sums of the two disjoint partitions. Although this problem is known to be NP-hard and requires exponential time to solve, we propose a less demanding version of this problem where the goal is to find a locally optimal solution. In our approach, we consider the local optimality in respect to any movement of at most two elements. To accomplish this, we developed an algorithm that can generate a locally optimal solution in at most $O(N^2)$ time and $O(N)$ space. Our algorithm can handle arbitrary input precisions and does not require positive or integer inputs. Hence, it can be applied in various problem scenarios with ease.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们的研究涉及集合分割问题的优化版本，目标是将两个不相交分区的和的绝对差最小化。虽然这个问题已知为NP难问题，需要指数时间来解决，但我们提出了一个更简单的问题版本，即寻找一个局部最优解。在我们的方法中，考虑到至多移动两个元素的局部最优性。为了实现这一点，我们开发了一种算法，可以在$O(N^2)$时间和$O(N)$空间内生成局部最优解。我们的算法可以处理任意输入精度，不需要正数或整数输入。因此，它可以轻松地应用于各种问题场景中。",
