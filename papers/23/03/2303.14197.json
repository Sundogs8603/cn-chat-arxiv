    "translated_abstract": "深度强化学习（DRL）提高了自动驾驶车辆（AV）的效率，但也使它们容易受到后门攻击，这可能导致交通拥堵或碰撞。后门功能通常是通过污染训练数据集以保持对真实输入的高准确性并诱导攻击者选择的特定输入的期望（恶意）输出来实现的。当前抵御后门攻击的防御主要集中在使用基于图像的特征进行图像分类上，这不能很好地转移到DRL基础的AV控制器的回归任务，因为输入是连续的传感器数据，即AV及其周围车辆的速度和距离的组合。我们提出的方法是将精心设计的噪声添加到输入中来中和后门攻击。该方法涉及学习一个最佳平滑（噪声）分布来保持真实输入的正常功能同时中和后门攻击。通过这样做，我们实现了在DRL基础的AVs中更好的后门攻击检测和防御。",
