    "abstract": "Process mining is rapidly growing in the industry. Consequently, privacy concerns regarding sensitive and private information included in event data, used by process mining algorithms, are becoming increasingly relevant. State-of-the-art research mainly focuses on providing privacy guarantees, e.g., differential privacy, for trace variants that are used by the main process mining techniques, e.g., process discovery. However, privacy preservation techniques for releasing trace variants still do not fulfill all the requirements of industry-scale usage. Moreover, providing privacy guarantees when there exists a high rate of infrequent trace variants is still a challenge. In this paper, we introduce TraVaG as a new approach for releasing differentially private trace variants based on \\text{Generative Adversarial Networks} (GANs) that provides industry-scale benefits and enhances the level of privacy guarantees when there exists a high ratio of infrequent variants.

    "translated_abstract": "流程挖掘在工业领域快速发展，然而事件数据中包括的敏感和私人信息的隐私问题也越来越受关注。现有研究主要关注为主要流程挖掘技术，如流程发现，提供差分隐私等隐私保证的变体。然而，释放变体的隐私保护技术仍未满足工业规模使用的所有要求，并且在出现高频稀有变体时提供隐私保证仍然是一个挑战。本文提出一种基于生成的对抗网络（GAN）的新方法TraVaG，用于发布具有差分隐私的不同变体，并在出现高比例稀有变体时提供工业规模的好处和提高隐私保证水平。此外，TraVaG通过生成多样和具有代表性的新变体来克服以往技术的局限性，同时保护隐私。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a new approach called TraVaG, based on GANs, for releasing differentially private trace variants, which provides industry-scale benefits, enhances privacy guarantees when there exists a high ratio of infrequent variants, and overcomes the limitations of previous techniques by generating new variants that are diverse and representative of the underlying event data while preserving privacy."
