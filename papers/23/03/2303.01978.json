    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新方法，称为一类带符号距离函数（OCSDF），通过可证明地学习边界支持的带符号距离函数（SDF）来执行一类分类（OCC）。支持到边界的距离可以解释为正常度分数，其使用1-Lipschitz神经网络的近似提供了对$l2$对抗攻击的鲁棒性边界，这是基于深度学习的OCC算法中一个未被充分探索的弱点。因此，OCSDF带有一种新的度量标准，称为认证AUROC，可以以与任何传统AUROC相同的成本计算。我们展示了在表格和图像数据上OCSDF与并发方法竞争，同时对抗攻击的鲁棒性要强得多，说明了其理论特性。最后，作为探索性研究展望，我们从理论和经验角度展示了OCSDF如何将OCC与图像生成和隐式神经表面参数联系起来。",
