The proposed method supports efficient computations and model exchange in a network of heterogeneous nodes and allows personalization of the learning model in the presence of non-i.i.d. data. To further enhance privacy, we introduce a random mask procedure that helps avoid data inversion.

    "translated_abstract": "本文设计了一种基于支持向量机（SVM）的高效分布式迭代学习方法，用于处理联邦分类和回归。该方法支持在异构节点网络中进行高效的计算和模型交换，并允许在存在非独立同分布数据的情况下学习模型的个性化。为进一步提高隐私保护，我们引入了一种随机掩码过程，有助于避免数据反演。最后，我们分析了所提出的隐私机制以及参与者硬件和数据的异构性对系统性能的影响。",
