    "translated_abstract": "最近几年来，随着先进机器学习和人工智能的快速发展和新兴安全和隐私威胁的出现，联邦学习（FL）已广受欢迎。 FL使边缘设备的本地数据存储能够高效生成模型，而不需将敏感数据透露给任何实体。尽管这种范例在一定程度上缓解了用户敏感数据的隐私问题，但在不断增长的网络威胁和隐私侵犯技术下，FL过程的性能可能会受到威胁并达到瓶颈。为了促进FL过程的普及，区块链与FL环境的集成已经引起了学术界和工业界的广泛关注。区块链具有分散化、不可变性、共识和透明度等特性，有潜力防止安全和隐私威胁。但是，如果区块链机制需要昂贵的计算资源，那么资源受限的FL可能会成为瓶颈。",
