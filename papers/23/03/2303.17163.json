    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了本科线性代数教学中学生经常面临的一些困难，并确定了他们在处理需要算法思维技能的话题时经常遇到的一些常见错误和困难，如矩阵分解。我们特别关注（正交）对角化和奇异值分解（SVD）。我们还提供了使用SageMath探索这些主题的可能性，它是一种基于Python的免费开源软件计算机代数系统（CAS），尽管其输出本质上是静态的，但已被确定为在计算过程中帮助许多学生的有用工具。然后，我们通过向聊天机器人询问有关该主题的示例或解决问题来探索动态ChatGPT，即通过从特定矩阵构造（正交）对角化或SVD来完成任务。通过在线性代数中巩固基本概念并通过有效实践提高计算技能，我们旨在为学生提供更深入的矩阵分解理解，并为各个领域的应用做好准备。",
    "tldr": "本文通过对SageMath和ChatGPT的调查和比较，旨在为学生提供更深入的矩阵分解理解。",
