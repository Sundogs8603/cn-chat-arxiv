    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在信号传递方面，规制接收者反应选择的代表面临的委托问题。本文提供了计算规制者愿意委托的新观点，并设计了最优（反应）区间委托作为规划者一般机制设计问题的解决方案。接收者类型的相对异质性和发件人信号的生产力对最优区间委托的确定起着至关重要的作用，因为需要在匹配效率和信号成本之间做出权衡决策。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the delegation problem in markets for matching between receivers and senders with signaling, and proposes optimal interval delegation as a solution to the problem. It analyzes the relative heterogeneity of receiver types and the productivity of the sender's signal to find the optimal delegation method that balances the trade-off between matching efficiency and signaling costs."
