    "translated_abstract": "分子分类的应用使得脑肿瘤的治疗得到转变，使诊断更加准确，治疗更加个性化。然而，对于患有脑肿瘤的病人，及时进行分子诊断测试仍然存在限制，使得手术和副辅助治疗更为复杂，阻撓了临床试验的报名。本文构建了DeepGlioma诊断筛选系统，该系统是一种基于人工智能的快速（<90秒）、无标记的光学成像诊断技术。DeepGlioma使用多模态数据集进行训练，包括刺激拉曼组织学（SRH）和大型、公共基因组数据。在153例进行SRH成像的弥漫性胶质瘤患者组成的前瞻性、多中心、国际范围的测试队列中，我们展示了DeepGlioma可以预测世界卫生组织用于定义成人型弥漫性胶质瘤分类的分子改变（IDH mut）。",
