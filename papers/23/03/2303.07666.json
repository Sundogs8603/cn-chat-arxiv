    "translated_abstract": "多任务学习的一个关键假设是，在推断时，多任务模型只能访问给定数据点，而不能访问来自其他任务的数据点标签。这为将多任务学习扩展到利用来自其他辅助任务的数据点标签提供了机会，并在这种方式上提高新任务的性能。在这里，我们介绍了一种新颖的关系多任务学习设置，其中我们利用来自辅助任务的数据点标签来对新任务进行更准确的预测。我们开发了MetaLink，其中我们的关键创新是构建一个连接数据点和任务的知识图，从而使我们能够利用来自辅助任务的标签。知识图由两种类型的节点组成：（1）数据节点，其中节点特征是神经网络计算的数据嵌入，以及（2）任务节点，其中包含每个任务的最后一层权重作为节点特征。该知识图中的边捕捉数据任务关系，边标签表示这些关系的强度。我们证明了这种方法在各种数据集上显著优于最先进的多任务学习方法。",
