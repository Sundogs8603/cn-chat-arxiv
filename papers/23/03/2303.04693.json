    "translated_abstract": "随机森林（RF）是一种著名的数据驱动算法，在多个领域中应用广泛，因为它在建模响应变量和预测变量之间的关系时具有很大的灵活性，即使在存在强非线性关系的情况下也适用。在环境应用中，常常出现感兴趣的现象可能存在空间和/或时间依赖性，这在RF的标准版本中没有明确考虑到。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种分类法，根据它们在何时（前处理、中处理和/或后处理）尝试将空间信息纳入回归RF中来对策略进行分类。此外，我们根据《系统回顾和Meta分析首选报告项目》（PRISMA）提供的标准，对最近采用的调整回归RF以适应空间相关数据的策略进行系统回顾和分类。后者是一种可重复的方法，用于收集和处理关于特定主题的不同来源的现有文献。",
