In an experimental study with 196 participants, we show that task performance and task satisfaction improve through AI delegation, regardless of whether humans are aware of the delegation.

    "translated_abstract": "近期研究提出了一种人工智能（AI）模型，可以学习决定是否通过考虑双方的能力来为任务的实例预测或将其委派给人类。在使用合成生成或上下文无关的人预测进行的模拟中，相对于人或AI模型单独完成任务，委派可以帮助改善人机团队的表现。然而，到目前为止，人们在意识到AI模型委派任务实例给他们时如何执行和感知任务仍不清楚。在一项有196名参与者的实验研究中，我们展示了AI委派可以提高任务表现和任务满意度，无论人类是否意识到委派。此外，我们确定了人类高水平的自我效能感是这些表现和满意度改善的基础机制。我们的发现提供了初步的证据，表明允许AI模型接管任务实例可以在人机协作中提高表现和满意度。",
