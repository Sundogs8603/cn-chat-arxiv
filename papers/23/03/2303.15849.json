Compared with traditional methods, PINNs can efficiently handle high-dimensional problems, while the accuracy is relatively low, especially for highly irregular problems. Inspired by the idea of adaptive finite element methods and incremental learning, we propose GAS, a Gaussian mixture distribution-based adaptive sampling method for PINNs. During the training procedure, GAS uses the current residual information to generate a Gaussian mixture distribution for the sampling of additional points, which are then trained together with history data to speed up the convergence of loss and achieve a higher accuracy. Several numerical simulations on 2d to 10d problems show that GAS is a promising method which achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy among deep solvers, while being comparable with traditional numerical solvers.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着深度学习在科学计算中的应用研究，PINNs方法因其高维问题处理的高效性而引起了广泛的关注，但其准确性相对较低，特别是针对高度不规则的问题。受自适应有限元方法和增量学习思想启发，我们提出了GAS，一种基于高斯混合分布的自适应采样方法，用于PINNs。在训练过程中，GAS利用当前的残差信息生成高斯混合分布以采样其他点，这些数据将与历史数据一起训练，加快损失函数的收敛速度并实现更高的准确性。在2D到10D问题的数值模拟中，GAS是一种有前途的方法，它在深层求解器中达到了最先进的精度，同时与传统数值求解器相当。",
