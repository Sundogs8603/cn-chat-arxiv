    "translated_abstract": "事件相机最近受到了广泛关注，因为它们为复杂的计算机视觉问题提供了低延迟和低功率的解决方案。为了实现这些解决方案，需要开发能够利用事件数据的独特性质的算法。然而，目前的最新技术仍然受到基于帧的文献的影响，并且往往无法兑现这些承诺。在这项工作中，我们考虑到了这一点，并提出了一种新颖的自监督学习流程，用于顺序估计基于事件的光流，使得模型能够扩展到高推理频率。核心是一个持续运行的带状态神经模型，使用对比度最大化的新型公式进行训练，使其对输入事件中的非线性和变化统计保持稳健。多个数据集上的结果证实了我们方法的有效性，从而在精度方面创造了新的技术水平。",
