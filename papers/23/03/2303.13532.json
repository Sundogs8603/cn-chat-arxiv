    "translated_abstract": "欧洲国家的大多数公共设施，包括法国、德国和英国，在1950年至1980年的重建项目中建造。由于这些重要基础设施的状况日益恶化，近几十年来维护操作成本相对较高。维护操作成本的一部分资金用于技术人员。因此，充分利用可用的劳动力对于优化操作成本至关重要。这包括计划技术干预、工作负载平衡、生产率改进等。本文关注技术员的路由和任务调度。为此，我们解决了一种名为技术员路由和调度问题（TRSP）的工作力调度问题。这个问题在不同的领域有应用，例如交通基础设施（铁路和道路网络）、电信和污水设施。为了解决TRSP问题，我们提出了一种增强的迭代局部搜索算法，结合了基于贪心启发式的高效初始化过程、一组精心选择的邻域结构和一种新颖的摇动机制。我们的实验结果表明，所提出的算法优于文献中现有算法。",
