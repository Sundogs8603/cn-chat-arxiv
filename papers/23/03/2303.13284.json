The model takes a question in natural language as input and produces a simpler form of the intended SPARQL query. In the simpler form, the model does not directly produce entity and relation IDs. Instead, it produces corresponding entity and relation labels. The labels are grounded to KG entity and relation IDs in a subsequent step. To further improve the results, we instruct the model to produce a truncated version of the KG embedding for each entity. The truncated KG embedding enables a finer search for disambiguation purposes. We find that T5 is able to learn the truncated KG embeddings without any change of loss function, improving KGQA performance. As a result, we report strong results for LC-QuAD 2.0 and SimpleQuestions-Wikidata datasets on end-to-end KGQA over Wikidata.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个名为GETT-QA的端到端知识图谱问答系统。GETT-QA使用了T5，这是一种热门的文本到文本预训练语言模型。该模型以自然语言形式的问题作为输入并生成所需SPARQL查询的简化形式。在简化形式中，模型不直接生成实体和关系ID，而是产生相应的实体和关系标签。标签在随后的步骤中与KG实体和关系ID联系起来。为了进一步改进结果，我们指导模型为每个实体生成KG嵌入的截断版本。截断的KG嵌入使得更精细的搜索从而更有效进行消歧。我们发现，T5能够在不改变损失函数的情况下学习截断的KG嵌入，提高了KGQA的性能。因此，我们在Wikidata的LC-QuAD 2.0和SimpleQuestions-Wikidata数据集上报告了端到端KGQA的强大结果。",
