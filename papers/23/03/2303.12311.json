    "translated_abstract": "心电图是一种常用的非侵入式、方便的医疗监测工具，可辅助临床诊断心脏疾病。最近，深度学习（DL）技术，特别是自监督学习（SSL），在心电图分类方面展示出了巨大的潜力。在微调之后，SSL的预训练仅依靠少量的注释数据就取得了有竞争力的性能。然而，当前的SSL方法依赖于注释数据的可用性，无法预测微调数据集中不存在的标签。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了多模态心电图文本自监督预训练（METS），这是第一篇利用自动生成的临床报告来指导心电图SSL预训练的工作。我们使用可训练的心电编码器和冻结的语言模型分别嵌入配对的心电图和自动生成的机器临床报告。SSL旨在最大化心电图和自动生成的报告之间的相似性，同时确保心电和文本模态的嵌入对齐良好。在两个基准心电图数据集上的实验结果表明，METS在零样本学习和少样本学习设置中显著改善了心电图分类性能，优于各种最先进的方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a heart signal classification method called METS, which uses a trainable ECG encoder and a frozen language model to embed paired ECG and automatically machine-generated clinical reports separately, to achieve ECG zero-shot learning. The method significantly improves ECG classification performance in both zero-shot and few-shot learning settings, outperforming various state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark ECG datasets."
