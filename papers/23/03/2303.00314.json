    "translated_abstract": "在未来的温室气体中和能源系统中，预计将全球贸易绿色氢。然而，仍然缺乏考虑整个过程链的绿色氢的时间和空间明确的成本潜力，这对于创建有效的全球战略十分必要。因此，这项研究使用基于开放场光伏和陆上风电的优化能源系统方法，为全球28个选定的国家提供了详细的成本潜力曲线，直到2050年。结果显示巨大的氢电位（>1,500 PWhLHV/a）和79 PWhLHV/a 在2050年成本低于2.30 EUR/kg，由非洲和中东富裕太阳能的国家主导。分散的基于光伏的氢生产，即使在富有风电资源的国家，也始终是首选。需要提供可持续的水来生产氢，同时对氢的成本影响较小。来自民主地区的进口的额外成本仅总计高出7％。因此，这样的地区可以…",
