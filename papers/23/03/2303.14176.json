    "translated_abstract": "脉冲神经网络（SNN）是一类仿生神经网络，通过异步和稀疏处理，承诺将低功耗和低延迟的推理应用于边缘设备。然而，作为时间模型，SNN依赖于表达丰富的状态才能生成与经典人工神经网络（ANN）相当的预测结果。这些状态仅在长时间瞬态周期后收敛，并在没有输入数据的情况下迅速衰减，导致更高的延迟、功耗和较低的准确性。本文通过使用以低速率运行的辅助ANN初始化状态来解决这个问题。然后，SNN使用状态以高时间分辨率生成预测，直到下一个初始化阶段。因此，我们的混合ANN-SNN模型结合了两个世界的优点：优化了ANN和SNN之间的性能平衡，不受长时间状态转换和状态衰减的影响，可以实现高时间分辨率、低延迟和低功耗的预测。我们展示了该模型在低功耗/低延迟视觉感知任务上的良好表现。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a hybrid ANN-SNN architecture that addresses the balance between accuracy, latency, and power consumption in low-power and low-latency visual perception. The architecture initializes the state with a low-rate auxiliary ANN and generates predictions with high temporal resolution using SNN, achieving high accuracy, low latency, and low power consumption."
