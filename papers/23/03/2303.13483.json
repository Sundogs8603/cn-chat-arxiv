    "translated_abstract": "为了进行各种人工智能任务，如视觉对话和具体操作，将三维场景中的物体属性和关系基础化是必要的。然而，三维领域的变化性导致了两个基本的挑战：1）标注成本昂贵；2）复杂的三维基础语言。因此，模型的基础要求是数据高效、能够推广到不同的数据分布和任务以及具有看不到语义形式的基础复杂语义（例如，视点锚定和多对象引用）。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了NS3D，一种三维基础的神经符号框架。NS3D通过利用大型的语言到代码模型将语言转化为具有分层结构的程序。程序中的不同功能模块被实现为神经网络。值得注意的是，NS3D通过引入能够有效推理出视点锚定、多对象引用和其他三维场景中复杂语义的功能模块，扩展了以前的神经符号视觉推理方法。当NS3D在几个基准数据集上进行测试时，我们展示了NS3D与现有方法相比的最先进或具有竞争力的性能。",
