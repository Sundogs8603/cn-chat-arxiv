    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习取得了很大的发展，由于使用GPU进行训练，导致能耗和碳排放量增加。传统的解决方案尝试将训练工作移动到碳强度较低的位置或时间框架，以回应可持续性的呼吁。然而，由于数据集大小或数据法规等原因，将工作移动到其他地方并不总是可行的。此外，推迟训练可能会对应用服务质量产生负面影响，因为支持服务的DNN没有得到及时更新。在本研究中，我们提出了一种实用的解决方案，可以降低DNN训练的碳足迹，而无需迁移或推迟工作。特别地，我们的解决方案在训练过程中观察实时的碳强度变化并控制GPU的能耗，从而在保持训练性能的同时降低碳足迹。此外，为了主动适应不断变化的电网条件，我们提出了一种预测方法来预测未来的碳强度，从而实现更有效的碳减排。我们的方法适用于各种DNN应用程序，无需额外的硬件或基础设施。图像分类任务的实验结果表明，我们的方法可以将碳强度降低高达44%，而不会牺牲训练性能。",
