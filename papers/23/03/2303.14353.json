    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型在许多计算机视觉任务中（包括图像恢复）已经建立了新的技术水平。基于扩散的逆问题求解器从严重损坏的测量数据中生成出具有出色视觉质量的重建结果。然而，在所谓的感知-失真权衡中，感知效果优秀的重建结果通常是以退化的失真度量（如PSNR）为代价的。失真度量衡量对观察的忠实度，这在逆问题中是一个至关重要的要求。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的逆问题求解框架，即我们假设观察值来自一个随机劣化过程，逐渐降低和噪声化原始干净图像，然后学习逆转劣化过程以恢复干净图像。我们的技术在整个逆转过程中保持与原始测量的一致性，并允许在感知质量和数据一致性之间取得巨大的灵活性。我们的方法称为DiracDiffusion，因为它基于由Dirac能量函数引导的扩散过程。我们在包括去噪和增量重建在内的几个具有挑战性的图像恢复任务中展示了我们方法的有效性。",
