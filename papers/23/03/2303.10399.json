    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）是一种有效的分布式机器学习框架，它实现了模型训练和同时保护本地数据隐私。由于其出色的性能和可观的利润，它已被应用于广泛的实践领域。但是，谁拥有模型，如何保护版权已成为一个真正的问题。现有的中心化场景下的财产权保护方法（如水印嵌入和模型指纹）直观上能够解决 FL 中的版权问题。但是，由于 FL 的分布式性质，在不共享数据、参数聚合和联合训练设置方面仍然存在挑战。我们首次正式定义了 FL 的版权保护问题，并提出了 FedRight 来保护基于模型指纹的模型版权，即通过生成对抗性样本来提取模型特征。FedRight 在四个关键方面的性能表现优于以前的工作：（i）有效性：它通过对抗性样本提取模型特征，可以由第三方进行验证；（ii）安全性：它为本地模型提供保护，并防止潜在攻击者窃取模型；（iii）鲁棒性：它可以抵御不同类型的攻击，并在各种场景下实现高效的保护性能；（iv）效率：它引入轻量化和低计算开销进行训练和推断。",
