    "translated_abstract": "及早、准确地检测疾病对于患者管理和成功治疗结果至关重要。然而，在医学图像中自动识别异常可以是具有挑战性的。传统方法依赖于难以获取的大型标记数据集。为了克服这些限制，我们引入了一种新的无监督方法，称为PHANES（用于异常分割的虚假健康生成网络）。我们的方法具有翻转异常的能力，即保留健康组织并用伪健康重构替换异常区域。与最近的扩散模型不同，我们的方法不依赖于学习噪声分布，也不会引入随机变化到整个图像。相反，我们使用潜在的生成网络来创建可能异常的掩膜，然后使用修补生成网络进行细化。我们展示了PHANES在T1w脑MRI数据集中检测中风损伤方面的有效性，并展示了显著的性能提升。",
