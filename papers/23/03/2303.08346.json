    "translated_abstract": "基于图神经网络(GNN)的社交推荐模型通过利用GNN在社交关系中的偏好相似性来提高用户偏好的预测准确性。然而，关于推荐的有效性和效率，很大一部分社交关系可能是冗余的甚至是嘈杂的，例如，在某个领域中，朋友之间不共享偏好是很正常的。现有模型没有完全解决这个关系冗余和噪音的问题，因为它们直接表征整个社交网络上的社交影响。在本文中，我们提出通过仅保留信息丰富的社交关系来改进基于图的社交推荐，以确保一个高效和有效的影响扩散，即图形去噪。我们设计的去噪方法是基于偏好引导的，以建模社交关系的信心，并通过提供一个去噪但更具信息量的社交图为推荐用户偏好学习提供帮助。",
