    "translated_abstract": "组合药物疗法是涉及两种或多种药物的治疗方案，通常用于癌症、艾滋病、疟疾或结核病患者。目前，PubMed上有超过35万篇文章使用了“组合药物治疗”MeSH(化学物质主题词表)头衔，每年至少发表1万篇文章，持续时间已达两个十年。从科学文献中提取出组合疗法固有地构成了一个$n$元关系抽取问题。不同于普通的$n$元设置，其中$n$是固定的（例如药物-基因-突变关系中的$n=3$），提取组合疗法是一个特殊的设置，其中$n \\geq2$是动态的，具体取决于每个实例。最近，Tiktinsky等人（NAACL 2022）推出了一个首个数据集CombDrugExt，用于从文献中提取此类疗法。在此，我们采用了序列到序列的端到端抽取方法，在CombDrugExt测试集中为正（或有效）组合实现了66.7\\%的F1得分。",
