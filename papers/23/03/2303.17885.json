    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一种无线联邦学习系统，通过正交无线通道允许服务器和工人交换未编码信息。由于工人频繁通过带宽受限通道向服务器上传本地梯度，因此从工人到服务器的上传链路成为一个通信瓶颈。因此，利用一次性分布式主成分分析（PCA）来减小上传梯度的维度，从而缓解通信瓶颈。基于低维梯度和 Nesterov 动量提出了基于 PCA 的无线联邦学习（PCA-WFL）算法及其加速版本（即 PCA-AWFL）。对于非凸损失函数，进行了有限时间分析，量化了系统超参数对 PCA-WFL 和 PCA-AWFL 算法收敛的影响。PCA-AWFL 算法经过理论证明比 PCA-WFL 算法更快地收敛。此外，考虑无线信道衰落和随机工人模型的共存，数值实验验证了所提出算法的有效性。",
