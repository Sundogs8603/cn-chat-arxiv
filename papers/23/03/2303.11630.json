    "abstract": "Box-supervised instance segmentation has gained much attention as it requires only simple box annotations instead of costly mask or polygon annotations. However, existing box-supervised instance segmentation models mainly focus on mask-based frameworks. We propose a new end-to-end training technique, termed BoxSnake, to achieve effective polygonal instance segmentation using only box annotations for the first time. Our method consists of two loss functions: (1) a point-based unary loss that constrains the bounding box of predicted polygons to achieve coarse-grained segmentation; and (2) a distance-aware pairwise loss that encourages the predicted polygons to fit the object boundaries. Compared with the mask-based weakly-supervised methods, BoxSnake further reduces the performance gap between the predicted segmentation and the bounding box, and shows significant superiority on the Cityscapes dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "带框注释的实例分割因只需要简单的框标注而非昂贵的掩膜或多边形标注而引起了广泛关注。然而，现有的带框实例分割模型主要集中在基于掩膜的框架上。我们提出了一种新的端到端训练技术BoxSnake，首次仅使用框注释实现有效的多边形实例分割。我们的方法包括两个损失函数：（1）基于点的单元损失，约束预测多边形的边界框以实现粗略分割；（2）距离感知的成对损失，促使预测的多边形贴合物体边界。与基于掩膜的弱监督方法相比，BoxSnake进一步降低了预测分割与边界框之间的性能差距，并在Cityscapes数据集上表现出显着的优越性。",
