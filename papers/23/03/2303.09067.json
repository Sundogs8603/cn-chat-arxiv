    "abstract": "Existing question-answering research focuses on unanswerable questions in the context of always providing an answer when a system can\\dots but what about cases where a system {\\bf should not} answer a question. This can either be to protect sensitive users or sensitive information. Many models expose sensitive information under interrogation by an adversarial user. We seek to determine if it is possible to teach a question-answering system to keep a specific fact secret. We design and implement a proof-of-concept architecture and through our evaluation determine that while possible, there are numerous directions for future research to reduce system paranoia (false positives), information leakage (false negatives) and extend the implementation of the work to more complex problems with preserving secrecy in the presence of information aggregation.",

    "translated_abstract": "目前的问答研究侧重于始终提供答案的情况下非可回答问题的处理，但是如何应对那些系统“不应该”回答的问题呢？这可能是为了保护敏感用户或敏感信息。许多模型在遭受对抗性用户的审问时会暴露敏感信息。我们试图找出是否可能教会问答系统保守特定的机密。我们设计和实现了一个概念验证架构，并通过我们的评估确定尽管可能，但有许多未来研究的方向，以减少系统的偏执症（误报），信息泄漏（漏报）并将该工作的实现扩展到在信息汇聚的情况下保持机密的更复杂问题。",
