    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) strategies have demonstrated remarkable performance in various recognition tasks. However, both our preliminary investigation and recent studies suggest that they may be less effective in learning representations for fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR) since many features helpful for optimizing SSL objectives are not suitable for characterizing the subtle differences in FGVR. To overcome this issue, we propose learning an additional screening mechanism to identify discriminative clues commonly seen across instances and classes, dubbed as common rationales in this paper. Intuitively, common rationales tend to correspond to the discriminative patterns from the key parts of foreground objects. We show that a common rationale detector can be learned by simply exploiting the GradCAM induced from the SSL objective without using any pre-trained object parts or saliency detectors, making it seamlessly to be integrated with the existing SSL process.

    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习（SSL）策略在各种识别任务中展示出了卓越的性能。然而，我们的初步调查和最近的研究表明，它们在学习细粒度视觉识别（FGVR）的表示时可能不太有效，因为许多有助于优化SSL目标的特征不适合描述细粒度视觉识别中的细微差异。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了学习一个额外的筛选机制，以识别跨实例和类别中常见的具有区分性的线索，本文称之为常见理由。从直觉上讲，常见理由往往对应于前景物体的关键部位的区分模式。我们展示了一个常见理由检测器可以通过简单地利用从SSL目标导出的GradCAM来学习，而无需使用任何预训练的物体部位或显著性检测器，从而使其无缝集成到现有的SSL过程中。",
