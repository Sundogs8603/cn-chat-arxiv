Almost all research within healthcare data processing is concerned with formal clinical data, but there is valuable information in non-clinical data too. The present study combines methods within distributed computing, text retrieval, clustering, and classification into a coherent and computationally efficient system, that can clarify cancer patient trajectories based on non-clinical and freely available information. We produce a fully-functional prototype that can retrieve, cluster and present information about cancer trajectories from non-clinical forum posts. We evaluate three clustering algorithms (MR-DBSCAN, DBSCAN, and HDBSCAN) and compare them in terms of Adjusted Rand Index and total run time as a function of the number of posts retrieved and the neighborhood radius. Clustering results show that neighborhood radius has the most significant impact on c",

    "translated_abstract": "在线上存在着大量关于癌症的信息，但分类和提取有用信息很困难。几乎所有的医疗保健数据处理研究都涉及正式的临床数据，但非临床数据中也有有价值的信息。本研究将分布式计算、文本检索、聚类和分类方法结合成一个连贯、计算有效的系统，基于非临床和免费可用的信息，可以澄清癌症患者的病程。我们开发了一个完全功能的原型，可以从非临床论坛帖子中检索、聚类和展示关于癌症病程的信息。我们评估了三种聚类算法（MR-DBSCAN、DBSCAN和HDBSCAN），并比较了它们在调整后的兰德指数和总运行时间方面的表现，作为检索的帖子数量和邻域半径函数。聚类结果显示，邻域半径对聚类结果有最显著的影响。",
