    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been leveraged for several years now, obtaining state-of-the-art performance in recognizing entities from modern documents. For the last few months, the conversational agent ChatGPT has \"prompted\" a lot of interest in the scientific community and public due to its capacity of generating plausible-sounding answers. In this paper, we explore this ability by probing it in the named entity recognition and classification (NERC) task in primary sources (e.g., historical newspapers and classical commentaries) in a zero-shot manner and by comparing it with state-of-the-art LM-based systems. Our findings indicate several shortcomings in identifying entities in historical text that range from the consistency of entity annotation guidelines, entity complexity, and code-switching, to the specificity of prompting. Moreover, as expected, the inaccessibility of historical archives to the public (and thus on the Internet) also impacts its performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLM)多年来一直被用于现代文档中的实体识别，取得了最先进的性能。最近几个月，会话代理ChatGPT由于其生成听起来合理的答案的能力，在科学界和公众中引起了很多兴趣。本文尝试以零-shot的方式探究ChatGPT在一次性源（例如历史报纸和古典注释）中进行命名实体识别和分类（NERC）任务的能力，并将其与最先进的基于LM的系统进行比较。研究发现，在识别历史文本中的实体方面存在几个缺陷，包括实体注释准则的一致性、实体的复杂性和代码切换以及提示的特定性。此外，由于历史档案对公众不可访问（因此无法在互联网上使用），也影响了ChatGPT的性能。",
