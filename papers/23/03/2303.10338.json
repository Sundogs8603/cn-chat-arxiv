    "abstract": "Radiology AI models have made significant progress in near-human performance or surpassing it. However, AI model's partnership with human radiologist remains an unexplored challenge due to the lack of health information standards, contextual and workflow differences, and data labeling variations. To overcome these challenges, we integrated an AI model service that uses DICOM standard SR annotations into the OHIF viewer in the open-source LibreHealth Radiology Information Systems (RIS). In this paper, we describe the novel Human-AI partnership capabilities of the platform, including few-shot learning and swarm learning approaches to retrain the AI models continuously. Building on the concept of machine teaching, we developed an active learning strategy within the RIS, so that the human radiologist can enable/disable AI annotations as well as \"fix\"/relabel the AI annotations. These annotations are then used to retrain the models. This helps establish a partnership between the radiologist",

    "translated_abstract": "放射学的AI模型已经在接近或超越人类的表现方面取得了重大进展。然而，由于缺乏卫生信息标准、上下文和工作流差异以及数据标注差异，AI模型与人类放射学家的合作仍然是一个未被探索的挑战。为了克服这些挑战，我们将使用DICOM标准SR注释的AI模型服务集成到开源的LibreHealth放射学信息系统（RIS）中的OHIF查看器中。在本文中，我们描述了该平台的新型人工智能合作能力，包括Few-shot学习和Swarm学习方法来不断重新训练AI模型。基于机器教学的概念，我们在RIS中开发了一种主动学习策略，使人类放射学家可以启用/禁用AI注释以及“修复”/重新标注AI注释。这些注释然后被用来重新训练模型。这有助于建立放射学家和AI之间的合作，其中AI充当助手，在检测到异常时可以提示放射学家，同时从放射学家的更正中学习和改进。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper describes the integration of a general-purpose AI assistant into an open-source radiology information system, which utilizes Few-shot and Swarm learning methods to continuously retrain and improve the AI model using annotations from radiologists. The AI acts as an assistant, prompting radiologists when an abnormality is detected while also learning and improving from their corrections."
