    "translated_abstract": "大多数材料的发现都旨在发现比目前已知材料更优越的材料。然而，这很接近于外推，对于大多数学习数据概率分布的机器学习模型来说这是一个弱点。本文提出了一种基于人工智能驱动的组合化学方法，它是一种基于规则的反向分子设计器，不依赖于数据。由于我们的模型有可能生成从分子片段组合中获得的所有可能的分子结构，因此可以发现具有更优越性质的未知材料。我们理论和实验证明了我们的模型比概率分布学习的模型更适合于发现更好的材料。在一个旨在发现七个目标特性分子的实验中，我们的模型在10万次试验中发现了1315个达到全部目标的分子和7629个达到五个目标的分子，而概率分布学习模型只有发现几个。",
