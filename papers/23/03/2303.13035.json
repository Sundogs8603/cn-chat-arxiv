    "translated_abstract": "电子健康记录（EHR）存储着包括病历、诊断、治疗和检测结果在内的大量患者信息。这些记录对于医疗保健专业人员做出明智的患者护理决策非常关键。摘要临床笔记可以帮助医疗保健专业人员更好地发现潜在健康风险，以及做出更好的决策。这一过程通过确保医疗保健专业人员可以访问最相关和最新的患者数据，有助于减少错误并提高患者的护理效果。最近的研究表明，将提示与大语言模型（LLM）相结合可以显著提高摘要任务的效率。然而，我们发现这种方法也会导致输出方差增加，即使提示意义相似，输出也会有明显的差异。为了解决这一挑战，我们引入了一个模型无关的软提示校准（SPeC）流程，该流程采用软提示嵌入来减轻输入变量对输出多样性的影响。我们的实验表明，SPeC不仅可以降低LLM的性能变异，而且在临床笔记摘要任务上优于现有的最先进模型。",
