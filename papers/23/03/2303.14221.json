    "translated_abstract": "用机器学习方法研究股市是揭示隐藏市场规律的主要方向。与传统分析方法相比，这种知识有助于深入了解金融市场动态并获得行为洞察。股票价格与世界事件和社会观念密切相关。因此，在构建股票价格预测模型时，关键阶段是加入这些从新闻和社交媒体帖子反映出来的外部信息。为了实现这一点，研究人员利用隐式或显式的知识表示：（1）从文本中提取的情感或（2）原始文本嵌入。然而，在影响金融模型预测能力方面，这些方法之间的直接比较研究太少。在本文中，我们旨在弥补这一差距，并弄清楚语义特征方法能否超越基于情感的方法。我们的结果证明了后者在预测市场趋势方面的优越性，并概述了两种表示方式的优点和挑战。",
