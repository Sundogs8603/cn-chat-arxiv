    "translated_abstract": "因果性有望真正改变我们解决许多实际问题的方式。然而，迄今为止，因果性的潜力在很大程度上仍未得到充分发挥，因为因果性常常需要无法在实践中进行测试的关键假设。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一种全新的关于因果性的思考方式——我们称之为因果深度学习。我们的因果深度学习框架涵盖了三个方面：（1）结构维度，它将部分可以测试的因果知识融入，而不是假设感兴趣的变量之间的因果知识是完整的或完全不存在的；（2）参数维度，它涵盖了捕捉感兴趣的变量之间关系类型的参数形式；（3）时间维度，它捕捉感兴趣的变量如何在时间上相互作用（可能有因果关系）。因果深度学习使我们能够在各种实际问题上取得进展。",
