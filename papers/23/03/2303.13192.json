    "abstract": "In many applications, ads are displayed together with the prices, so as to provide a direct comparison among similar products or services. The price-displaying feature not only influences the consumers' decisions, but also affects the advertisers' bidding behaviors. In this paper, we study ad auctions with display prices from the perspective of mechanism design, in which advertisers are asked to submit both the costs and prices of their products. We provide a characterization for all incentive compatible auctions with display prices, and use it to design auctions under two scenarios. In the former scenario, the display prices are assumed to be exogenously determined. For this setting, we derive the welfare-maximizing and revenue-maximizing auctions for any realization of the price profile. In the latter, advertisers are allowed to strategize display prices in their own interests. We investigate two families of allocation policies within the scenario and identify the equilibrium prices ",

    "translated_abstract": "在许多应用程序中，广告与价格一起展示，以便提供类似产品或服务的直接比较。价格展示功能不仅影响消费者的决策，还影响广告商的竞标行为。在本文中，我们从机制设计的角度研究带有展示价格的广告竞价，要求广告商提交其产品的成本和价格。我们提供了所有可激励兼容的展示价格竞价的特征，并用它来设计两种情况下的拍卖。在前一种情况下，假设展示价格是外生确定的。对于这种情况，我们得到了任何价格配置的最大福利和最大收入的拍卖。在后一种情况下，广告商被允许为他们的利益制定展示价格。我们研究了场景内两个族群的分配策略，并确定了均衡价格。",

Two scenarios are considered: one where display prices are exogenously determined and the other where advertisers can strategize display prices for their own interests. Different auction designs are proposed for each scenario."
