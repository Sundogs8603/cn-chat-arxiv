    "translated_abstract": "临床决策需基于真实医学影像进行反事实推理，因此需要进行因果图像合成。为此，我们提出了一种新的方法，用于建模人口统计变量、临床指数和阿尔茨海默病患者的脑MR影像之间的因果关系。具体来说，我们利用结构因果模型来描述因果关系，利用风格生成器来合成图像。此外，为了减少建模复杂性并使学习可行，我们提出使用低维潜在特征表示高维3D图像，结合外生噪声，以建立图像和非图像变量之间的因果关系。我们基于1586个受试者和3683个3D图像进行了实验，并合成了在某些属性干预下的反事实脑MR图像，如年龄、脑容积和认知测试得分等。定量指标和对反事实图像的定性评估证明了所提方法的有效性。",
