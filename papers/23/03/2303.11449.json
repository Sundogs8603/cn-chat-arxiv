    "translated_abstract": "使用自动化分类系统的主要问题是，如果它们没有正确地进行工程化和公平性考虑，它们可能对特定人群具有不利影响。此外，虽然工程师们已经开发了前沿的图像分类技术，但在人类文化遗产收藏中应用这些模型仍存在差距，因为这里的数据集通常包含质量低劣的人们照片，这些人们具有不同的族裔、性别和年龄。在本研究中，我们使用两个最先进的神经网络Xception和EfficientNet评估了三种偏见缓解技术，用于性别分类。此外，我们探索使用公平数据集的迁移学习，以克服训练数据的稀缺性。我们在19世纪和20世纪的文化遗产照片收藏上评估了偏见缓解管道的有效性，并使用FairFace数据集进行了迁移学习实验。经过评估，我们发现我们提出的偏见缓解技术成功地减少了性别分类中的偏见，尤其是对于弱势群体。我们的研究为如何解决人类文化遗产图像分类中的公平问题提供了洞见。",
