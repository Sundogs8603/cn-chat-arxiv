    "translated_abstract": "评估日常锻炼中肌肉疲劳程度为精确定制康复和个性化训练剂量提供重要指标，特别是在Metaverse的背景下。评估涉及多肌肉协调运动的疲劳需要表示多肌肉时空适应的疲劳特征和捕捉疲劳时间演变进程的估计器的神经肌肉特征。本文提出了通过肌肉补偿和脊髓模块激活变化的特征来描述疲劳，并通过生理基础模型估计持续性疲劳。我们提取了肌肉协同分数和脊髓模块尖峰值方差作为疲劳诱导神经肌肉适应的特征，并将这些特征视为观测值，开发了贝叶斯高斯过程用于捕捉时间演变过程。我们采用无监督估计策略解决了训练数据中缺乏监督的问题。我们在8名健康参与者进行了一项试点研究，参与者进行了一系列协同抬腿练习，结果证明了所提出的方法根据神经肌肉特征有效地估计了持续性疲劳。",
