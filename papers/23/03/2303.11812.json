    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT是一个可公开访问的聊天机器人，可以快速生成指定主题的文本，但是不知道聊天机器人是否在写作的所有方面上都比人类作家优秀，并且不知道在更新命令的基础上其写作质量是否可以显著提高。因此，本研究比较了ChatGPT和中国中级英语（CIE）学习者在叙事主题上的写作表现，以揭示聊天机器人在写作方面的优势和劣势。数据使用Coh-Metrix（一种用于分析语言篇章的特殊工具）按照五个篇章成分进行分析。结果显示，ChatGPT在叙事性、词汇具体性和指代连贯性方面表现优于人类作家，但在句法简单性和深层连贯性方面表现较差。在更新了更多的修订命令后，结果版本的句法简单性得到了改善，但仍远远落后于CIE学习者的写作表现。",
