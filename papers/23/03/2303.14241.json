    "abstract": "Blockchains are now significantly easing trade finance, with billions of dollars worth of assets being transacted daily. However, analyzing these networks remains challenging due to the large size and complexity of the data. We introduce a scalable approach called \"InnerCore\" for identifying key actors in blockchain-based networks and providing a sentiment indicator for the networks using data depth-based core decomposition and centered-motif discovery. InnerCore is a computationally efficient, unsupervised approach suitable for analyzing large temporal graphs. We demonstrate its effectiveness through case studies on the recent collapse of LunaTerra and the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) switch of Ethereum, using external ground truth collected by a leading blockchain analysis company. Our experiments show that InnerCore can match the qualified analysis accurately without human involvement, automating blockchain analysis and its trend detection in a scalable manner.",

    "translated_abstract": "区块链在贸易金融中的应用越来越广泛，每天交易的资产价值达数十亿美元。然而，由于数据的规模和复杂性，对这些网络进行分析仍然具有挑战性。我们介绍了一种可伸缩的方法- InnerCore，用于识别基于区块链的网络中的关键参与者，并使用基于数据深度的内核分解和中心模式发现提供网络情感指标。 InnerCore是一种计算高效、非监督的方法，适用于分析大规模时间图。我们通过对LunaTerra的最近崩溃和以太坊的PoS切换进行案例研究，并使用一家领先的区块链分析公司收集的外部基本事实证明了它的有效性。我们的实验表明，InnerCore可以与合格的分析准确匹配，不需要人为干预，从而实现可伸缩的区块链分析和趋势检测。",
