    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the use of social media websites, obtaining the users' feedback automatically became a crucial task to evaluate their tendencies and behaviors online. Despite this great availability of information, and the increasing number of Arabic users only few research has managed to treat Arabic dialects. The purpose of this paper is to study the opinion and emotion expressed in real Moroccan texts precisely in the YouTube comments using some well-known and commonly used methods for sentiment analysis. In this paper, we present our work of Moroccan dialect comments classification using Machine Learning (ML) models and based on our collected and manually annotated YouTube Moroccan dialect dataset. By employing many text preprocessing and data representation techniques we aim to compare our classification results utilizing the most commonly used supervised classifiers: k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and deep learning (DL) classif",

    "translated_abstract": "随着社交媒体网站的迅速增长，自动获取用户反馈成为评估其在线趋势和行为的重要任务。尽管信息大量可用，阿拉伯使用者数量增加，但很少有研究处理阿拉伯方言。本文旨在准确研究在YouTube评论中表达的真实摩洛哥方言文本的观点和情感，使用一些众所周知且常用的情感分析方法进行。通过采用许多文本预处理和数据表示技术，我们旨在比较我们使用最常用的监督分类器进行分类结果：K最近邻（KNN）、支持向量机（SVM）、朴素贝叶斯（NB）和深度学习（DL）分类器，这些都是基于我们收集和手动注释的YouTube摩洛哥方言数据集。",
