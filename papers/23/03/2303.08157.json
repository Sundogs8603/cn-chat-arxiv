To achieve this while minimally perturbing the original posteriors, we introduce a filter-aware universal approximation framework for posterior objectives. This defines appropriate graph neural networks trained at runtime to be similar to filters but also locally optimize a large class of objectives, including fairness-aware ones.

    "translated_abstract": "通过边传播将先前的节点值转换为后来的分数的图滤波器通常支持影响人类的图挖掘任务，例如推荐和排名。因此，重要的是在满足节点组之间的统计平等约束方面使它们公平（例如，按其代表性将分数质量在性别之间均衡分配）。为了在最小程度地扰动原始后验情况下实现此目标，我们引入了一个过滤器感知的通用近似框架，用于后验目标。这定义了适当的图神经网络，其在运行时训练，类似于过滤器，但也在本地优化包括公平感知在内的大类目标。在一组8个过滤器和5个图形的实验中，我们的方法在满足统计平等约束方面表现得不亚于替代品，同时保留基于分数的社区成员推荐的AUC并在传播先前节拍时创建最小实用损失。",
