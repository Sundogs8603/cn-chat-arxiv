    "translated_abstract": "我们为使用尖峰神经元进行信息处理开发了一种新的学分分配算法，无需反馈突触。具体而言，我们提出了一种基于事件驱动的前向-前向和预测式前向-前向学习过程的通用化方案，用于迭代处理感觉输入。因此，递归电路会根据局部自下向上、自上而下和侧面的信号计算每层中每个神经元的膜电位，促进一种动态的、逐层并行的神经计算形式。与依赖反馈突触调整神经电活动的尖峰神经编码不同，我们的模型纯在线并且时间向前，这样就能够学习带有时间尖峰信号的感觉数据模式的分布表示。值得注意的是，我们在几个模式数据集上的实验结果表明，基于事件驱动的前向前向（ED-FF）框架工作正常。",
