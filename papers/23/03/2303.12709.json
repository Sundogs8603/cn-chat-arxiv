    "abstract": "Design mockups are essential instruments for visualizing and testing design ideas. However, the process of generating mockups can be time-consuming and challenging for designers. In this article, we present and evaluate two different modalities for generating mockup ideas to support designers in their work: (1) a sketch-based approach to generate mockups based on hand-drawn sketches, and (2) a semantic-based approach to generate interfaces based on a set of predefined design elements. To evaluate the effectiveness of these two approaches, we conducted a series of experiments with 13 participants in which we asked them to generate mockups using each modality. Our results show that sketch-based generation was more intuitive and expressive, while semantic-based generative AI obtained better results in terms of quality and fidelity. Both methods can be valuable tools for UI designers looking to increase their creativity and efficiency.",

    "translated_abstract": "设计模型是可视化和测试设计想法的重要工具。然而，生成模型的过程对设计师来说可能会耗费大量时间并具有挑战性。本文提出并评估了两种不同的模态，以支持设计师在其工作中生成模型想法：（1）基于手绘草图生成模型的方法，（2）基于一组预定义的设计元素生成界面的语义方法。为了评估这两种方法的有效性，我们进行了一系列实验，以13个参与者为受试对象，让他们使用每种模态生成模型。结果表明，基于手绘的生成方法更加直观和富有表现力，而基于语义的生成AI在质量和逼真度方面获得更好的结果。这两种方法都可以成为UI设计师提高创造力和效率的有价值工具。",
