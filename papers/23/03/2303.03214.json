Such simulations are important to verify if the system is able to connect the different sets of agents linked to the platform in a functional manner. They also provide inputs to guide the choices of operational parameters, such as the platform spread, and strategies by DeLend, since they estimate how the key variables of interest respond to different policies. We discuss the methodology and provide examples meant to clarify the approach and to how we intend to use the tool in practice -- they should not be interpreted as representative of real life scenarios.",
