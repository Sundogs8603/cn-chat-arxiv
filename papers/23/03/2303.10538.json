    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了UTSP，一种利用无监督学习框架求解旅行商问题（TSP）的方法。我们使用替代损失训练图神经网络（GNN）。GNN输出一个热力图表示每个边成为最优路径的概率。然后，我们应用局部搜索根据热力图生成最终预测。我们的损失函数由两部分组成：一部分推动模型找到最短的路径，另一部分作为约束条件，确保路径形成哈密顿循环。实验结果表明，UTSP优于现有的数据驱动TSP启发式算法。我们的方法参数效率和数据效率均较高：与强化学习或监督学习方法相比，该模型仅占用约10％的参数和约0.2％的训练样本。",
    "tldr": "无监督学习框架UTSP能够对旅行商问题进行求解，它使用图神经网络作为基础模型，在保证路径为哈密顿循环的前提下，能够找到最短路径。相较于其他方法，UTSP在训练样本与参数数量上占用更少的资源，且性能更佳。",
    "en_tdlr": "UTSP is an unsupervised learning framework that leverages a Graph Neural Network to generate a heat map representing the probability for each edge to be part of the optimal path for solving the TSP. With the efficient loss function, UTSP outperforms existing data-driven TSP heuristics in terms of both parameter efficiency and data efficiency, and finds the shortest path while ensuring the route forms a Hamiltonian Cycle."
