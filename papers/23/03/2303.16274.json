    "translated_abstract": "风电场建模是一个日益受到关注的领域，已经开发出众多基于分析及计算的方法来拓展风电场效率边界、最大化发电量。本文提出了一种新的机器学习框架 WakeNet，可以在多种偏航角度、风速和湍流强度下，以99.8%的平均精度生成泛化的 2D 涡流速场，与 FLORIS 作为最先进的风电场模拟软件计算出的解决方案相比。由于高保真度数据生成成本高昂，本文还研究了多保真度转移学习的实用性。具体而言，对低保真度高斯涡模型进行预训练后微调，以便获得中等保真度卷曲涡模型的精确涡流结果。通过偏航和布局优化等多种涡流控制问题的演示，展示了 WakeNet 的健壮性和整体性能。结果显示，WakeNet 能够实现比基准场景增加 12.8% 的发电量，并比 FLORIS 提高 3.2%，且计算占用小。",
