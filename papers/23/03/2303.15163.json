    "translated_abstract": "在线创新社区允许在由限制限定的设计空间内寻找新解决方案。过去的研究重点放在了创意限制对个人项目的影响上，但我们知道的关于约束如何影响对反复设计提交学习和在线平台的技术约束影响较少。创意和技术约束如何影响在线社区中个人探索设计空间的学习？本研究分析了一家在线创新社区十年的数据，来自33,813个人的136,989项设计提交被众包。我们利用了平台上运行的两种类型的设计比赛——创意受限和非受限，并评估一个自然实验，其中平台变化减少了技术约束。我们发现，只有在技术限制得以缓解的情况下，创意约束才会导致高学习率。我们的研究发现具有重要的实践意义。",
