    "translated_abstract": "基于评分的生成模型（SGMs）在各种任务中展示了出色的合成结果。然而，目前前向扩散过程的设计领域仍然较少开发，并且通常依赖物理启发法或简化假设。利用可扩展的贝叶斯后验采样器的见解，我们提出了一种完整的配方，用于在SGMs中制定前向过程，确保收敛到所需的目标分布。我们的方法揭示了几个现有的SGMs可以被看作是我们框架的特定表现形式。在这个方法的基础上，我们引入了相空间Langevin扩散（PSLD），它依赖于基于评分的建模，在由辅助变量增强的类似物理相空间的扩展空间中进行。实证结果表明，与已建立的图像合成基准上的各种竞争方法相比，PSLD展现了更优质的样本质量和改进的速度-质量权衡。",
