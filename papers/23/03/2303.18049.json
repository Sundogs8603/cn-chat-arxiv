    "translated_abstract": "在线社交网络（OSN）因信息传播成本低而成为假新闻的温床。尽管现有方法在新闻内容和传播结构方面已经做出了许多尝试，但是检测假新闻仍面临两个挑战：一是如何挖掘独特的关键特征和演化模式，二是如何解决小样本问题来构建高性能模型。与利用传播拓扑结构的流行方法不同，本文从语义、情感和数据增强的角度提出了一个新的假新闻检测框架，挖掘了新闻参与者在传播过程中的情感演化模式，并设计了一种语义和情感的双重深度交互通道网络，考虑了评论以获得更全面和细粒度的新闻表示。同时，该框架引入了数据增强模块来解决训练样本不足的问题。实验结果表明了我们提出的方法的有效性和优越性。",

The framework uses a dual deep interaction channel network of semantic and emotion, considering comments, to obtain a more comprehensive and fine-grained news representation. Additionally, the framework introduces a data enhancement module to solve the problem of insufficient training samples. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method."
