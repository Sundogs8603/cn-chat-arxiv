    "translated_abstract": "传统上混沌和不可预测是同义词，但最近统计预测的进展表明，大型机器学习模型可以从复杂系统的长时间观测中获得意想不到的见解。在本文中，我们对规模上的混沌预测进行了研究，通过对 135 种不同低维混沌系统的众包数据库进行 24 种代表性最高的多元预测方法的大规模比较。我们发现，基于人工神经网络的大规模的领域不可知时间序列预测方法始终展现出强大的预测性能，在某些情况下可以产生持续数十个李雅普诺夫时间的准确预测。最佳的混沌预测结果由最近引入的分层神经基础函数模型实现，但即使是通用的变压器和循环神经网络也表现出强大的性能。然而，物理启发式混合方法如神经常微分方程和储层计算机的性能更好，尤其是在更小的数据集上。",
