    "translated_abstract": "最近，学习型控制方面取得了重大进展，它借助深度函数逼近器，例如神经网络，来模拟受控动态系统随时间的演化。然而，学习动态模型和稳定控制器的问题仍然存在，因为对于已知的非线性系统，合成稳定反馈律是一项困难的任务，更何况对于必须适应数据的复杂参数表示。为此，我们提出了具有内在李亚普诺夫稳定性（CoILS）的控制方法，该方法可以从数据中联合学习非线性动力学模型和稳定控制器的参数表示。为此，我们的方法同时学习参数化李亚普诺夫函数，从而使动力学模型本身具有稳定性，可以由学习的控制器实现。除了我们新构建的具有学习动态稳定性保证的稳定性外，我们还展示了在某些假设下，学习的控制器可以使真实动态稳定。",
