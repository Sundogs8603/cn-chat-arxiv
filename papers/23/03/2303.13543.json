    "translated_abstract": "近年来，核方法在相似性测量任务中得到广泛应用，特别是图核在生物信息学、化学和金融数据分析等领域都被广泛使用。然而，现有方法，特别是基于熵的图核存在计算复杂度大和忽略节点级信息的问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的标记子图熵图核，在结构相似性评估中表现良好。我们设计了一种动态规划子图枚举算法，有效减少了时间复杂度。特别地，我们提出了标记子图，它用语义信息丰富了子结构拓扑。类比于统计力学中气团簇扩展的过程，我们重新推导了配分函数，并计算全局图熵来描述网络。为了测试我们的方法，我们应用了几个真实数据集，并评估了不同任务的效果。",

It reduces time complexity with a dynamic programming subgraph enumeration algorithm and enriches substructure topology with semantic information using labeled subgraphs. The global graph entropy is used to describe the network, and the method has been applied to multiple real-world datasets with good results in different tasks."
