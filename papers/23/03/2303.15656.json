    "translated_abstract": "对早产儿不良新生儿结局的诊断对早产儿的生存至关重要，因为它使医生能够及时提供治疗。机器学习算法已被证明在预测不良新生儿结局方面是有效的。然而，大多数以前的基于机器学习的方法仅集中在预测单个结果，忽略了不同结果之间的潜在相关性，可能导致结果次优和过拟合问题。在本论文中，我们首先分析了三种不良新生儿结局之间的相关性，然后将多个新生儿结局的诊断形式化为多任务学习问题。我们提出了一个MTL框架来联合预测多个不良新生儿结局。特别是，MTL框架包含共享隐藏层和多个任务特定分支。我们使用121名早产儿的电子健康记录进行了广泛的实验。实证结果表明了MTL框架的有效性。",
