    "translated_abstract": "发现新药物靶点（DT）相互作用是新药开发过程中的重要步骤。大部分用于预测DT交互的计算机技术都集中于二元分类，目的在于确定DT对是否相互作用。然而，蛋白质配体相互作用则假设存在一系列不同的绑定强度值，也称为结合亲和力，预测这些值一直是一个难点。随着DT知识库中亲和力数据数量的增加，可以使用深度学习架构等先进的学习技术来预测结合亲和力。本文提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，仅使用来自靶标和药物的测序信息来预测DT结合亲和力。结果表明，这种使用1D表示来自靶标和药物的深度学习模型是一种有效的药物靶标结合亲和力预测方法，不需要额外的特征或描述。",
