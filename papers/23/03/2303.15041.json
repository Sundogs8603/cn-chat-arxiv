    "translated_abstract": "深度学习算法最近已经被证明是估计统计模型参数的成功工具，模拟容易但似然计算具有挑战性。但这些方法的成功取决于模拟出可以充分复制观察数据的参数，并且目前缺乏有效的方法来产生这些模拟数据。我们开发了基于弱参数结构假设估计统计模型参数的新的黑盒程序。对于似然函数有较频繁出现的良好结构的情况，如时间序列，这是通过在广泛的模拟数据库上预训练深度神经网络来实现的，该数据库涵盖了各种数据大小的范围。对于其他类型的复杂依赖关系，则需要一个迭代的算法来指导多轮正确参数区域的模拟。这些方法可以成功地从具有复杂空间相关的非高斯模型中估计和量化参数的不确定性。",
