    "translated_abstract": "考虑到人类语音感知的双模性质，嘴唇和牙齿的运动在自动语音识别中起着至关重要的作用。通过利用相关和噪声不变的视觉信息，音视频识别系统可以在多种情境下提高鲁棒性。本文提出了一种混合方法，命名为conformer enhanced AV-HuBERT，进一步提高了AV-HuBERT系统的性能。与基线AV-HuBERT相比，我们的方法在干净和嘈杂条件下的单阶段评估中，在英语AVSR基准数据集LRS3上分别实现了7%和16%的相对WER降低。此外，我们建立了一个新的1000小时的中文AVSR数据集CSTS。在基线AV-HuBERT的基础上，我们通过利用这个数据集的预训练，在MISP和CMLR上将WeNet ASR系统超越了14%和18%。我们提出的conformer enhanced AV-HuBERT在MISP上带来了7%的性能提升和6%的CER。",
