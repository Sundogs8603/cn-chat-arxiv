    "translated_abstract": "对于医学影像中的机器学习应用，由于训练数据可用性有限，设计针对细微病情（如自闭症谱系障碍）的放射学分类器受到阻碍。迁移学习是解决低训练数据问题的一种方法。本文探讨在具有多个站点的先前数据的情况下使用元学习的使用，即我们称之为场地不可知元学习的方法，用于非常低数据制度的情况。受到元学习在优化模型跨多个任务方面的有效性的启发，我们提出了一个框架，使其适应于不同站点之间的学习。我们在来自38个影像站点的2,201个T1加权（T1-w）MRI扫描中测试了我们的元学习模型，这些数据是作为自闭症脑部影像数据交换（ABIDE）的一部分收集的（年龄：5.2-64.0岁）。该方法被训练为查找一个良好的初始状态，以便快速适应新的未见数据。",
