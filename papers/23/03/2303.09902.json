    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于深度学习的推荐系统取得了显著的成功。但是，这些方法通常严重依赖于有标签的数据（即用户-物品交互），遭受着数据稀疏和冷启动等问题。自监督学习是一种新兴的范式，它从未标记的数据中提取信息，为解决这些问题提供了见解。具体来说，对比自监督学习由于其灵活性和良好的性能，已经吸引了相当多的关注，并最近成为基于自监督学习的推荐方法中的主导分支。在本调查中，我们提供了当前基于对比自监督学习的推荐方法的最新和全面的评估。首先，我们提出一个统一的框架来概述这些方法。然后，我们根据框架的关键组成部分，包括视图生成策略、对比任务和对比目标，提出了一个分类法。对于每个组成部分，",
