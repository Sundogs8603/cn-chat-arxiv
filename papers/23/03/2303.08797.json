We first show how to construct a broad class of continuous-time stochastic processes whose time-dependent probability density function bridges two arbitrary densities exactly in finite time. These `stochastic interpolants' are built by combining data from the two densities with an additional latent variable, and the specific details of the construction can be leveraged to shape the resulting time-dependent density in a flexible way. We then show that the time-dependent density of the stochastic interpolant satisfies a first-order transport equation as well as a family of forward and backward Fokker-Planck equations with tunable diffusion; upon consideration of the time evolution of an individual sample, this viewpoint immediately leads to both deterministic and stochastic generative models based on proba",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一类建立在随机插值框架上的生成模型，该框架是基于Albergo＆Vanden-Eijnden（2023）提出的，在流和扩散方法上实现统一，我们首先展示了如何构建一类广泛的连续时间随机过程，其时间依赖的概率密度函数在有限时间内精确地连接两个任意的密度。这些“随机插值器”是通过将来自两个密度的数据与其他潜在变量相结合构建的，并且构造的具体细节可以灵活地塑造导致的时间依赖密度。然后我们展示了随机插值器的时间依赖密度满足一阶输运方程以及一系列具有可调扩散的正向和反向Fokker-Planck方程族; 在考虑单个样本的时间演化时，这个观点立即导致了基于概率微分方程的确定性和随机生成模型。",
