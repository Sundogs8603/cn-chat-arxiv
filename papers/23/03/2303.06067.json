    "abstract": "In real-world scenario, many phenomena produce a collection of events that occur in continuous time. Point Processes provide a natural mathematical framework for modeling these sequences of events. In this survey, we investigate probabilistic models for modeling event sequences through temporal processes. We revise the notion of event modeling and provide the mathematical foundations that characterize the literature on the topic. We define an ontology to categorize the existing approaches in terms of three families: simple, marked, and spatio-temporal point processes. For each family, we systematically review the existing approaches based based on deep learning. Finally, we analyze the scenarios where the proposed techniques can be used for addressing prediction and modeling aspects.",

    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界的场景中，许多现象以连续时间发生的一系列事件产生。点过程为建模这些事件序列提供了一种自然的数学框架。在本调查中，我们通过时间过程研究概率模型来建模事件序列。我们修订了事件建模的概念，并提供了表征相关文献的数学基础。我们定义了一个本体来以三个类别（简单、标记和时空点过程）对现有方法进行分类。对于每个类别，我们系统地回顾了基于深度学习的现有方法。最后，我们分析了提出的技术可以用于解决预测和建模方面的场景。",
