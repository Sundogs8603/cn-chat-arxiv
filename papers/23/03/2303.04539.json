    "abstract": "Although the degree of gender segregation in the UK has decreased over time, women's participation in traditionally \"female-dominated\" sectors is disproportionately high. This paper aims to evaluate how changing patterns of sectoral gender segregation affected women's employment contracts and wages in the UK between 2005 and 2020. We then study wage differentials in gender-specific dominated sectors. We found that the differences in wages and contractual opportunities result mainly from the propensity of women to be distributed differently across sectors. Hence, the disproportion of women in female-dominated sectors implies contractual features and lower wages typical of that sector, on average, for all workers. This difference is primarily explained by persistent discriminatory constraints, while human capital-related characteristics play a minor role. However, wage differentials would shrink if workers had the same potential wages as men in male-dominated sectors. Moreover, this does",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然英国的性别分离程度随着时间的推移有所降低，但女性在传统上“女性主导”的行业中的参与度仍然高于比例。本文旨在评估行业性别分离模式的变化如何影响英国2005年至2020年间女性的就业合同和工资，并研究性别特定主导行业中的工资差异。我们发现，工资和合同机会的差异主要来自于女性在不同行业之间的分配倾向。因此，女性在女性主导的行业中的不成比例会导致所有工人的典型合同特征和较低的平均工资。这种差异主要是由于持久的歧视性限制所解释，而人力资本相关特征只起到次要作用。然而，如果工人在男性主导的行业中具有与男性相同的潜在工资，工资差距将缩小。此外，这也会鼓励女性参加男性主导的行业，从而进一步减少性别分离。",
