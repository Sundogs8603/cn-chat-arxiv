    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）和机器学习越来越多地被用于旅行需求预测。尽管基于AI的旅行需求预测模型能产生准确的预测，但可能会产生预测偏差并引发公平性问题。使用这些有偏见模型进行决策可能会导致加剧社会不平等的交通政策。然而，目前对于解决这些模型的公平性问题的研究有限。因此，在本研究中，我们提出了一种新的方法来开发具有公平意识的、高度准确的旅行需求预测模型。特别地，我们提出的方法可以同时提高AI模型对于多个受保护属性（如种族和收入）的公平性。具体来说，我们引入了一个新的公平性正则化项，该项明确地设计用于衡量预测准确性与多个受保护属性之间的相关性，并将其加入到旅行需求预测模型的损失函数中。",
