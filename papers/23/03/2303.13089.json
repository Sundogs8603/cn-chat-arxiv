    "translated_abstract": "主动学习在确定预算内的基础上选择信息样本进行注释，近年来已经被证明在目标检测中高效。然而，广泛使用的主动检测基准在图像级别上进行评估，这在人工工作量估计中是不现实的，并且对拥挤图像存在偏差。此外，现有方法仍然执行图像级别注释，但是对于相同图像中的所有目标平等评分会浪费预算并产生冗余标签。鉴于以上问题和限制，我们引入了一种基于边界框的主动检测框架，在每个周期内控制基于边界框的预算，优先考虑信息目标并避免冗余以进行公平比较和高效应用。在提出的基于边界框的方案下，我们设计了一种新的流程，即互补伪主动策略（ComPAS）。 它以互补方式利用人类注释和模型智能：高效的输入端委员会仅查询信息对象的标签。",
