    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于数据驱动的方法来减少工业生产对周边城市的空气污染效应，该方法将运营决策与天气条件相结合。我们的方法结合了预测和指导式机器学习模型来预测短期风速和方向，并推荐运营决策以减少或暂停工业生产。我们展示了减少环境影响和维持生产活动之间的几种权衡。我们框架的预测组件采用各种机器学习模型，如梯度提升树模型和集成方法，进行时间序列预测。指导性组件利用可解释的最优策略树提出多个权衡方案，例如将危险排放物减少33-47%和将不必要的成本降低40-63%。我们部署的模型显著降低了预测误差，对于小于12小时的预测，降低了38-52%的误差范围，对于12到48小时的预测，降低了14-46%的误差范围。",
