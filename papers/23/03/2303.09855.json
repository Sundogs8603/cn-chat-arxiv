We observe that in high-dimensional space, the time consumption of nearly all AKNN algorithms is dominated by that of the distance comparison operations (DCOs). For each operation, it scans full dimensions of an object and thus, runs in linear time wrt the dimensionality. To speed it up, we propose a randomized algorithm named ADSampling which runs in logarithmic time wrt to the dimensionality for the majority of DCOs and succeeds with high probability. In addition, based on ADSampling we develop one general and two algorithm-specific techniques as plugins to enhance existing AKNN algorithms.

    "translated_abstract": "近似K最近邻（AKNN）搜索是一个基础而且具有挑战性的问题。我们观察到，在高维空间中，几乎所有AKNN算法的时间消耗都被距离比较操作（DCO）所支配。对于每个操作，它会扫描物体的全维度，因此，它的运行时间与维度成线性关系。为了加速该操作，我们提出了一种随机化算法，称为ADSampling，对于大多数DCO，它的运行时间与维度成对数关系，并且高概率成功。此外，基于ADSampling，我们开发了一般性和两个特定算法的技术作为插件来增强现有的AKNN算法。理论和实证研究都证实了：（1）我们的技术几乎不会引入精度损失，（2）它们一致地提高了效率。",
