    "translated_abstract": "我们研究多分类在线预测，其中学习者可以使用多个标签的列表进行预测（与传统设置中仅使用一种标签不同）。我们使用 $b$-ary Littlestone 维度表征了该模型中的可学习性。该维度是经典 Littlestone 维度的变体，其中二进制错误树被替换为 $(k+1)$-ary 错误树，其中 k 是列表中标签的数量。在懵懂的场景中，我们根据比较类中是否包含单标签或多标签函数以及它与算法使用的列表大小之间的权衡来探索不同的情况。我们发现在某些情况下可以实现负悔，同时提供了什么情况下实现负悔的完整特性化。作为我们工作的一部分，我们改编了经典算法，如 Littlestone 的 SOA 和 Rosenblatt 的感知器，以使用标签列表进行预测。我们还为可以进行列表学习的组合结果建立了基础。",
