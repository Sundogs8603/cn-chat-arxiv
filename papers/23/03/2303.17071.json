    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as valuable tools for many natural language understanding tasks. In safety-critical applications such as healthcare, the utility of these models is governed by their ability to generate outputs that are factually accurate and complete. In this work, we present dialog-enabled resolving agents (DERA). DERA is a paradigm made possible by the increased conversational abilities of LLMs, namely GPT-4. It provides a simple, interpretable forum for models to communicate feedback and iteratively improve output. We frame our dialog as a discussion between two agent types - a Researcher, who processes information and identifies crucial problem components, and a Decider, who has the autonomy to integrate the Researcher's information and makes judgments on the final output.  We test DERA against three clinically-focused tasks. For medical conversation summarization and care plan generation, DERA shows significant improvement over the base GPT-4 performance ",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型已成为许多自然语言理解任务的有价值工具。在医疗等关乎安全性的应用中，这些模型的实用性取决于它们生成的输出是否具备事实准确和完整性。本文介绍了对话型解决代理（DERA）。DERA是一种由LLM（特别是GPT-4）的对话能力提供支持的模式，它为模型提供了一个简单且易于理解的论坛，用于沟通反馈并迭代改进输出。我们将对话框架化为两个代理类型之间的讨论：一个研究人员，负责处理信息并识别关键问题组件；以及一个决策者，具有将研究人员的信息集成并对最终输出做出判定的自主权。我们将DERA用于三个临床相关任务的测试。在医疗对话摘要和护理计划生成方面，DERA显示出比基础GPT-4性能显著提高的效果。",
