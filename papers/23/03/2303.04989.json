    "translated_abstract": "现有的定向目标检测方法通常使用度量AP$_{50}$来衡量模型的性能。我们认为AP$_{50}$在定向目标检测中本质上不适用，因为它对角度偏差具有较大的容忍度。因此，我们主张使用高精度度量，例如AP$_{75}$，来衡量模型的性能。在本文中，我们提出了一种带有Transformer的面向长宽比敏感的定向目标检测器，称为ARS-DETR，在高精度定向目标检测中表现出竞争力。具体而言，我们提出了一种新的角度分类方法，称为面向长宽比的圆滑标签（AR-CSL），以更合理地平滑角度标签，并丢弃先前工作引入的超参数（例如CSL）。然后，设计了一个旋转可变形注意力模块，用于根据相应角度旋转采样点，并消除之前工作引入的样本点与特征点之间的错位。",
