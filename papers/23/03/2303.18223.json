    "translated_abstract": "语言本质上是一个由语法规则控制的复杂精细的人类表达系统，对于开发理解和掌握语言的能力的AI算法来说是一项重大挑战。作为主要方法之一，语言建模在过去二十年里广泛研究用于语言理解和生成，从统计语言模型演化为神经语言模型。最近，通过在大规模语料库上预训练Transformer模型，提出了预训练语言模型（PLMs），在解决各种NLP任务方面显示出强大的能力。由于研究人员发现模型缩放可以导致性能改进，他们进一步通过增加模型规模来研究缩放效应，有趣的是，当参数规模超过一定水平时，这些扩大的语言模型不仅可以实现显着的性能提升，而且还显示出一些小规模语言模型所没有的特殊能力。",
