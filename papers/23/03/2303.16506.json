Interpretability is crucial in machine learning, especially when it can directly impact human well-being. Although model-agnostic techniques exist for multi-target regression, specific techniques tailored to random forest models are not available. To address this issue, we propose a technique that provides rule-based interpretations for instances made by a random forest model for multi-target regression, influenced by a recent model-specific technique for random forest interpretability.

    "translated_abstract": "多目标回归在众多应用中非常有用。虽然随机森林模型在这些任务中表现良好，但往往难以解释。可解释性在机器学习中非常重要，特别是当它能直接影响人类福祉时更为重要。虽然存在针对多目标回归的模型无关解释技术，但没有特定于随机森林模型的技术。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种技术，用于为随机森林模型在多目标回归中产生基于规则的解释，受最近用于随机森林解释性的模型特定技术的影响。通过广泛的实验评估，证明了所提出的技术在解释方面与最先进的技术相比具有竞争力。",
