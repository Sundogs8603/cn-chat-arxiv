    "translated_abstract": "近期视觉Transformer（ViT）的快速发展使其在各种视觉任务中刷新了最先进的性能, 超过了传统的基于卷积神经网络的模型。这引发了一些最近在卷积神经网络领域的反击性研究，表明当仔细调整时，纯CNN模型可以实现与ViT模型一样出色的性能。然而，设计这样高性能的CNN模型是具有挑战性的，需要对网络设计具有非平凡的先验知识。为此，提出了一种新的框架，称为深度卷积神经网络的数学架构设计（DeepMAD）, 以系统的方式设计高性能的CNN模型。在DeepMAD中，CNN网络被建模为一个信息处理系统，其表现力和效果可以通过结构参数进行分析和计算。然后，提出了一个约束的数学规划（MP）问题来优化这些结构参数。MP问题可以通过现成的MP求解器在CPU上轻松解决，并具有较小的记忆量。",
