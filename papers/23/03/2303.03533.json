    "abstract": "Recently, reinforcement learning has led to dexterous manipulation skills of increasing complexity. Nonetheless, learning these skills in simulation still exhibits poor sample-efficiency which stems from the fact these skills are learned from scratch without the benefit of any domain expertise. In this work, we aim to improve the sample efficiency of learning dexterous in-hand manipulation skills using controllers available via domain knowledge. To this end, we design simple sub-skill controllers and demonstrate improved sample efficiency using a framework that guides exploration toward relevant state space by following actions from these controllers. We are the first to demonstrate learning hard-to-explore finger-gaiting in-hand manipulation skills without the use of an exploratory reset distribution.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，强化学习在提高复杂性方面取得了手部灵巧操作技能。然而，尽管在模拟环境中学习这些技能，但其样本效率仍然较低，这是因为这些技能是从零开始学习的，没有受益于任何领域专业知识。在这项工作中，我们旨在通过使用领域知识可用的控制器来提高学习手部灵巧操作技能的样本效率。为此，我们设计了简单的子技能控制器，并通过遵循这些控制器的动作，通过一个框架将探索引导到相关状态空间而展示了提高的样本效率。我们是第一个在没有使用探索性重置分布的情况下，演示了学习难以探索的手指步态手部操作技能。视频结果可以在https://roamlab.github.io/vge找到。",
