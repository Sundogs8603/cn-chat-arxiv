Two important examples considered in this paper are the MVE with Coulomb interactions and the vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equation. We show that a generalized self-consistency potential controls the KL-divergence between a hypothesis solution to the ground truth, through entropy dissipation.

    "translated_abstract": "我们将自洽性的概念扩展到更一般的McKean-Vlasov方程(MVE)中。虽然Fokker-Planck方程(FPE)描述了漂移和扩散下粒子的宏观行为，但MVE考虑了额外的粒子间相互作用，这在物理系统中通常具有奇异性。本文考虑了两个重要的示例，即具有库仑相互作用的MVE和二维Navier-Stokes方程的涡量表述。我们展示了广义自洽势通过熵耗散控制了假设解与真实解之间的KL散度。基于这一结果，我们提出通过最小化该势函数来求解MVE，并利用神经网络进行函数逼近。通过与现有的基于神经网络的PDE求解器在几个示例问题上的比较，验证了我们方法的实证性能。",
