    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个分布鲁棒主体-代理问题的公式，它概括了一些常见的最坏情况和贝叶斯主体-代理问题变体。利用这个公式，我们首先构建了一个理论框架来证明任何满射合同菜单是否是最优的，并量化了它的次优性。这个框架和它的证明依赖于几个相关优化问题的新颖构造和比较。粗略地说，我们的框架将合同菜单最优性的问题转化为对偶间隙的研究。然后，我们将框架操作化，研究简单的——仿射和线性——合同菜单的最优性。通过我们的框架，合同菜单的最优性差距被分解为可调节性差距和信息租金。我们表明，在生产成本的社会价值是凸的，且转换比率在代理的高状态下较大的情况下，这些简单的合同菜单往往接近最优。",
