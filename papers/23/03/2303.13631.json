    "translated_abstract": "自然语言中的词汇不仅传递信息，还随着文明和人类迁移而演变。音乐也是如此。为了理解音乐背后的复杂结构，我们引入了一个叫做Essential Element Network (EEN)的算法将音频编码成文本。该网络通过计算音调、时间和音量之间的相关性得到，通过优化EEN算法以生成Zipf定律应用于聚类系数的频率和排名，我们可以将语义关系视为词汇并生成它们的映射。我们将这些编码后的词汇映射到音调-时间空间中，有助于我们系统地组织音乐深层结构中的句法。相比于其他深度学习方法的黑盒子特性，我们的算法提供了对音乐背后复杂网络的精确描述。因此，这些过程积累的经验和属性不仅为此类应用提供了新的方法，同时也为许多其他相关领域的研究提供了探索的路径。",
