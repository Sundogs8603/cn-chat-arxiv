    "abstract": "3D object detection serves as the core basis of the perception tasks in autonomous driving. Recent years have seen the rapid progress of multi-modal fusion strategies for more robust and accurate 3D object detection. However, current researches for robust fusion are all learning-based frameworks, which demand a large amount of training data and are inconvenient to implement in new scenes. In this paper, we propose GOOD, a general optimization-based fusion framework that can achieve satisfying detection without training additional models and is available for any combinations of 2D and 3D detectors to improve the accuracy and robustness of 3D detection. First we apply the mutual-sided nearest-neighbor probability model to achieve the 3D-2D data association. Then we design an optimization pipeline that can optimize different kinds of instances separately based on the matching result. Apart from this, the 3D MOT method is also introduced to enhance the performance aided by previous frames.",

    "translated_abstract": "3D物体检测是自动驾驶中感知任务的核心基础。近年来，多模态融合策略在提高3D物体检测的鲁棒性和准确性方面取得了快速进展。然而，当前的鲁棒融合研究都是基于学习的框架，需要大量的训练数据，并且在新场景中实施不方便。在本文中，我们提出了GOOD，一个通用的基于优化的融合框架，可以在不训练额外模型的情况下达到令人满意的检测效果，并且适用于任意2D和3D检测器的组合，以提高3D检测的准确性和鲁棒性。首先，我们应用了互相邻近的概率模型实现了3D-2D数据关联。然后，我们设计了一个优化流程，可以根据匹配结果分别优化不同类型的实例。此外，还引入了3D MOT方法，通过之前的帧来增强性能。",
