    "abstract": "We introduce a Reinforcement Learning Psychotherapy AI Companion that generates topic recommendations for therapists based on patient responses. The system uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to generate multi-objective policies for four different psychiatric conditions: anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and suicidal cases. We present our experimental results on the accuracy of recommended topics using three different scales of working alliance ratings: task, bond, and goal. We show that the system is able to capture the real data (historical topics discussed by the therapists) relatively well, and that the best performing models vary by disorder and rating scale. To gain interpretable insights into the learned policies, we visualize policy trajectories in a 2D principal component analysis space and transition matrices. These visualizations reveal distinct patterns in the policies trained with different reward signals and trained on different clinical diagnoses. Our system's succe",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种使用Deep Reinforcement Learning（DRL）生成心理治疗主题推荐的强化学习心理治疗AI伴侣。该系统针对四种不同的精神疾病（焦虑症，抑郁症，精神分裂症和自杀病例）使用多目标策略生成器进行生成，同时通过三个不同的工作联盟评分标准（任务，关系和目标）来检验推荐主题的准确性。我们展示了系统能够相对较好地捕获真实数据（治疗师讨论的历史主题），最佳模型的表现因疾病和评级标准而异。为了获得可解释的洞见，我们在2D主成分分析空间和转移矩阵中可视化策略轨迹。这些可视化呈现了在不同奖励信号和不同临床诊断下训练的策略之间的独特模式。本系统在生成多目标策略心理治疗主题方面的成功表现为开发能够帮助治疗师提供个性化治疗的AI伴侣提供了有希望的方向。",

The system performs well on capturing real data and provides distinct patterns of policies trained with different reward signals and different clinical diagnoses through interpretable policy trajectory visualizations. It shows a promising direction for developing personalized treatments with AI companions for therapists."
