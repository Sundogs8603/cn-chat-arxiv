    "translated_abstract": "基于内容的图像检索是从广泛的图像库中基于视觉内容（如颜色，形状或空间关系和纹理）检索图像子集的过程。在某些应用中，如本地化，图像检索被用作初始步骤。在这种情况下，检索到的前几个图像的准确性显着影响总体系统准确性。本文介绍了一种简单而有效的图像检索系统，其可训练参数较少，可以在检索到的前几个图像中提供可接受的准确性。所提出的方法利用了一种带有三元组损失的扩张残差卷积神经网络。实验表明，该模型可以通过扩大感受野从而提取更丰富的信息（即高分辨率表示），从而提高图像检索准确性，而无需增加模型的深度或复杂度。为增强提取表示的鲁棒性，本研究获得了候选图像的多个Crop。",
