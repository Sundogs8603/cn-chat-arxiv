    "abstract": "Song translation requires both translation of lyrics and alignment of music notes so that the resulting verse can be sung to the accompanying melody, which is a challenging problem that has attracted some interests in different aspects of the translation process. In this paper, we propose Lyrics-Melody Translation with Adaptive Grouping (LTAG), a holistic solution to automatic song translation by jointly modeling lyrics translation and lyrics-melody alignment. It is a novel encoder-decoder framework that can simultaneously translate the source lyrics and determine the number of aligned notes at each decoding step through an adaptive note grouping module. To address data scarcity, we commissioned a small amount of training data annotated specifically for this task and used large amounts of augmented data through back-translation. Experiments conducted on an English-Chinese song translation data set show the effectiveness of our model in both automatic and human evaluation.",

    "translated_abstract": "歌曲翻译需要翻译歌词并对齐音符，以使结果可以演唱到相应的旋律上，这是一个具有挑战性的问题，在翻译过程的不同方面引起了一些兴趣。本文提出了一种自适应分组歌词旋律翻译（LTAG）的综合解决方案，它是一种新颖的编码器-解码器框架，可以同时翻译源歌词并通过自适应音符分组模块确定每个解码步骤的对齐音符数量。为了解决数据稀缺问题，我们委托少量的训练数据专门用于这个任务，并通过反向翻译使用大量的增强数据。实验结果表明，我们的模型在自动和人工评价中都具有有效性。",
