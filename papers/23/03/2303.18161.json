Our main aim is to find Nash equilibrium investment strategies in this setting in a financial market driven by a Brownian motion and investigate the influence the price impact has on the equilibrium. We consider both CRRA and CARA utility functions. Our findings show that the problem is well-posed as long as the price impact is at most linear. Moreover, numerical results reveal that the investors behave very aggressively when the price impact is beyond a critical parameter.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了$n$个投资者的战略互动，他们能够影响股票价格，同时相对于其他投资者测量他们的效用。我们的主要目的是在由布朗运动驱动的金融市场中找到纳什均衡投资策略，并研究价格影响对均衡的影响。我们考虑了CRRA和CARA效用函数。我们的研究表明，只要价格影响最多是线性的，问题就是良好定义的。此外，数值结果表明，当价格影响超过一个临界参数时，投资者的行为非常激进。",
