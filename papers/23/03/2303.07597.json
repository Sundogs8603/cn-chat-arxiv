    "translated_abstract": "正则化离散最优传输（OT）是衡量来自两个不同域的离散分布之间距离的有力工具。虽然正则化离散最优传输在机器学习中有广泛应用，但在某些情况下，来自其中一个域的样本数据会有类别标签，例如无监督域适应。在这种情况下，群稀疏正则化器经常被用作正则化项来处理类别标签。特别地，通过将具有相同类别标签的数据样本对应到一个群稀疏正则化器中，它可以保护数据样本上的标签结构。因此，我们可以通过解决带有梯度的正则化优化问题来利用标签信息进行距离度量。然而，当类别或数据样本数量较大时，对于正则化项的数量及其相应梯度数的增长，计算梯度的成本变得昂贵。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为快速群稀疏正则化离散最优传输（Fast GS-DOT）的新算法来解决这个问题。通过利用梯度矩阵的块对角结构，我们推导出一种有效的算法，它显著降低了计算时间，同时保持了传统方法相同的精度。我们在合成和真实数据上展示了我们算法的有效性，并展示了它在速度和精度方面优于现有方法。",
