    "translated_abstract": "现有的多视图聚类方法成功的前提是样本在多视图中保持完整性的假设。然而，在实际场景中，多视图样本由于数据损坏或传感器故障而部分地可用，导致不完整多视图聚类研究陷入困境。虽然已经有一些尝试来解决不完整多视图聚类问题，但存在以下缺点：（i）现有方法主要采用交叉视图对比学习，强制每个样本在多个视图中的表示是完全相同的，这可能会忽略视图差异和表示的灵活性；（ii）由于在多个视图中不存在未观察到的样本，所得到的聚类原型可能不对齐和偏斜，导致聚合不正确。为了解决以上问题，我们提出了一种跨视图部分样本和原型对齐网络(CPSPAN)，用于深度不完整多视图聚类。首先，与现有的基于对比的方法不同，我们采用部分样本的交叉视图聚合机制来捕捉视图之间的差异特征。其次，我们采用两个原型对齐策略来解决原型不对齐和聚合不正确的问题。",
