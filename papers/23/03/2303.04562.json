    "abstract": "We study the problem of extrapolative controlled generation, i.e., generating sequences with attribute values beyond the range seen in training. This task is of significant importance in automated design, especially drug discovery, where the goal is to design novel proteins that are \\textit{better} (e.g., more stable) than existing sequences. Thus, by definition, the target sequences and their attribute values are out of the training distribution, posing challenges to existing methods that aim to directly generate the target sequence. Instead, in this work, we propose Iterative Controlled Extrapolation (ICE) which iteratively makes local edits to a sequence to enable extrapolation. We train the model on synthetically generated sequence pairs that demonstrate small improvement in the attribute value. Results on one natural language task (sentiment analysis) and two protein engineering tasks (ACE2 stability and AAV fitness) show that ICE considerably outperforms state-of-the-art approach",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了外推控制生成问题，即生成属性值超出训练数据范围的序列。在自动设计领域，尤其是药物研究领域，这个任务至关重要，目标是设计出比现有序列更好（例如更稳定）的新型蛋白质。因此，按照定义，目标序列及其属性值超出训练分布，挑战现有直接生成目标序列方法。本研究提出了迭代控制外推（ICE）方法，通过迭代地对序列进行局部编辑来实现外推。我们使用合成的序列对对模型进行训练，演示微小的属性值改进。自然语言任务（情感分析）和两个蛋白质工程任务（ACE2稳定性和AAV适应性）的结果表明，ICE方法明显优于现有的最先进方法。",
