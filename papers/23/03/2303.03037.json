    "translated_abstract": "在安全关键的场景中，不确定性估计对于自动驾驶等任务至关重要，因为它为高级决策和路径规划等多个下游任务提供了宝贵的信息。在本文中，我们提出了EvCenterNet，一种新颖的不确定性感知的二维目标检测框架，使用证据学习直接估计分类和回归的不确定性。为了应用证据学习进行目标检测，我们设计了一种证据和焦点损失函数的组合，用于稀疏热图输入。我们引入了类平衡权重来处理证据学习中遇到的类不平衡问题。此外，我们提出了一种学习策略，通过重点关注最不确定的点来利用预测的热图不确定性来改善检测性能。我们在KITTI数据集上训练模型，并在包括BDD100K和nuImages在内的具有挑战性的分布外数据集上进行评估。",
