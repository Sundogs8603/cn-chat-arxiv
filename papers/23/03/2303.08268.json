Recent pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability in zero-shot robotic planning.

An interactive perception framework is therefore proposed with an LLM as its backbone, whose ability is exploited to instruct epistemic actions and to reason over the resulting multimodal sensations (vision, sound, haptics, proprioception), as well as to",
