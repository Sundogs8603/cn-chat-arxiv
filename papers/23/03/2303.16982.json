    "translated_abstract": "深度学习的最新发展在加速预测量子化学（QC）属性方面取得了显著进展，它消除了密度泛函理论等昂贵电子结构计算的需求。但是，以1D SMILES序列或2D分子图为基础的之前的方法未能实现高精度，因为QC属性主要取决于经电子结构方法优化的3D平衡构象。本文提出了一种名为Uni-Mol+的新方法来应对这一挑战。首先，给定一个2D分子图，Uni-Mol+从RDKit等廉价方法生成初始的3D构象。然后，初始构象被迭代地优化到其平衡构象，并进一步用于预测QC属性。所有这些步骤都是使用Transformer模型自动学习的。我们观察到，优化后的构象质量对QC属性预测至关重要。",
