    "abstract": "Individuals with visual impairments often face a multitude of challenging obstacles in their daily lives. Vision impairment can severely impair a person's ability to work, navigate, and retain independence. This can result in educational limits, a higher risk of accidents, and a plethora of other issues. To address these challenges, we present MagicEye, a state-of-the-art intelligent wearable device designed to assist visually impaired individuals. MagicEye employs a custom-trained CNN-based object detection model, capable of recognizing a wide range of indoor and outdoor objects frequently encountered in daily life. With a total of 35 classes, the neural network employed by MagicEye has been specifically designed to achieve high levels of efficiency and precision in object detection. The device is also equipped with facial recognition and currency identification modules, providing invaluable assistance to the visually impaired. In addition, MagicEye features a GPS sensor for navigatio",
