    "title": "Are high school degrees and university diplomas equally heritable in the US? A new measure of relative intergenerational mobility. (arXiv:2303.08445v1 [econ.GN])",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new measure of relative intergenerational mobility along the educational trait as a proxy of inequality of opportunity. The new measure is more suitable for controlling for the variations in the trait distributions of individuals and their parents than the commonly used intergenerational persistence coefficient. This point is illustrated by our empirical analysis of US census data from the period between 1960 and 2015: we show that controlling for the variations in the trait distributions adequately is vital in assessing the part of intergenerational mobility which is not caused by the educational expansion. Failing to do so can potentially reverse the relative priority of various policies aiming at reducing the \"heritability\" of high school degrees and tertiary education diplomas.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种相对代际流动性的新衡量方式，将教育特征作为机会不平等的代理。与通常使用的代际持久系数相比，新的衡量方式更适合控制个人和父母特征分布的变化。本文实证分析美国人口普查数据表明，充分控制特征分布的变化对于评估代际流动中不是由教育扩张引起的部分至关重要。否则，各种旨在减少高中毕业率和大学学位遗传性的政策的相对优先级可能会被颠倒。",
