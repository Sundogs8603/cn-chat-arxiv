    "translated_abstract": "Botnet攻击对网络系统构成了重大威胁，因为它们能够将它们攻陷的网络节点变成额外的攻击者，导致高容量攻击在长时间内蔓延。检测这种Botnet攻击的复杂性在于，多个网络IP地址将同时被攻陷。为此，除了已有的针对个别节点的传统方法外，对于 compromised nodes 的集体分类也很有用。因此，这项工作引入了一种集体Botnet攻击分类技术，它对一个n节点IP网络的流量进行操作，并使用一种新颖的Associated Random Neural Network（ARNN）来识别被攻陷的节点。ARNN是一种循环体架构，它包含两个相互关联、互相连接并且结构相同的n神经元随机神经网络，它们同时作为互相批判的评判者来确定哪些n个节点被攻击了。",
