    "translated_abstract": "近年来，轻量级神经网络在单图像超分辨率（SISR）任务方面取得了重大突破。与低频信息相比，高频细节的重建更加困难。大多数SISR模型为低频和高频信息分配相同的计算资源，这导致了对简单低频信息的冗余处理以及对更具挑战性的高频信息恢复不足。我们通过高频聚焦块（HFFB）提出了一种新颖的高频聚焦网络（HFFN），从而选择性地增强高频信息，同时最小化低频信息的冗余特征计算。HFFB有效地将更多的计算资源分配给更具挑战性的高频信息重建。此外，我们提出了一种本地特征融合块（LFFB），在本地区域内有效地融合了多个HFFB的特征，利用了互补信息。",
