    "abstract": "Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has achieved impressive representative performance with the aim of reconstructing randomly masked images. Despite the empirical success, most previous works have neglected the important fact that it is unreasonable to force the model to reconstruct something beyond recovery, such as those masked objects. In this work, we show that uniformly random masking widely used in previous works unavoidably loses some key objects and changes original semantic information, resulting in a misalignment problem and hurting the representative learning eventually. To address this issue, we augment MIM with a new masking strategy namely the DPPMask by substituting the random process with Determinantal Point Process (DPPs) to reduce the semantic change of the image after masking. Our method is simple yet effective and requires no extra learnable parameters when implemented within various frameworks. In particular, we evaluate our method on two representative MIM frameworks, MA",

    "translated_abstract": "遮盖图像建模（MIM）旨在重建随机遮盖的图像，并已取得了令人瞩目的代表性能。尽管具有实证效果，但大多数先前的工作忽略了一个重要事实，即强制模型重建超出恢复范围的物体（如那些被遮盖的物体）是不合理的。本文中，我们展示了先前工作中广泛使用的均匀随机遮盖不可避免地丢失一些关键物体并更改原始语义信息，从而导致了一种不对齐问题并最终伤害了代表性学习。为了解决这个问题，我们将确定性点过程（DPPs）替换为随机过程，提出了一个新的遮盖策略，即DPPMask，以减少遮盖后图像的语义变化。我们的方法简单而有效，实现时不需要额外的可学习参数。我们特别在两个代表性的MIM框架，MASK和GMS上对我们的方法进行了评估，结果在几个基准数据集上显著改善了代表性能。",
