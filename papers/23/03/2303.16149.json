In this study, we develop a fundamental-based model for the Canadian-U.S. dollar exchange rate within an interpretative framework. We propose a comprehensive approach using machine learning to predict the exchange rate and employ interpretability methods to accurately analyze the relationships among macroeconomic variables.

    "translated_abstract": "金融和经济系统的复杂性和歧义性，以及经济环境的频繁变化，使得难以进行准确的预测，并得到受理论支持的解释。解释用于预测重要宏观经济指标的预测模型对于理解不同因素之间的关系、增强对预测模型的信任度以及使预测更具操作性具有高度的价值。在本研究中，我们开发了一个基于基本面的模型来预测加拿大美元兑美国美元汇率并在一个解释性框架内进行了分析。我们提出了一种综合方法，利用机器学习预测汇率，并采用可解释性方法准确分析宏观经济变量之间的关系。此外，我们根据解释的输出实施了消融研究，以提高模型的预测准确性。我们的实证结果表明，原油作为加拿大的主要商品，对汇率有很大的影响。",
