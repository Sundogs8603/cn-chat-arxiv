    "abstract": "This work proposes an interactive art installation \"Mood spRing\" designed to reflect the mood of the environment through interpretation of language and tone. Mood spRing consists of an AI program that controls an immersive 3D animation of the seasons. If the AI program perceives the language and tone of the users as pleasant, the animation progresses through idealized renditions of seasons. Otherwise, it slips into unpleasant weather and natural disasters of the season. To interpret the language and tone of the user interaction, hybrid state-of-the-art emotion detection methods are applied to the user audio and text inputs. The emotional states detected separately from tone and language are fused by a novel approach that aims at minimizing the possible model disparity across diverse demographic groups.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种交互式艺术装置“情绪弹簧”，设计目的是通过解释语言和语调来反映环境的心情。情绪弹簧包含一个控制季节的沉浸式3D动画的AI程序。如果AI程序感知到用户的语言和语调是愉悦的，动画将进展到理想化的季节再现。否则，它将滑入季节中不愉快的天气和自然灾害。为了解释用户交互的语言和语调，混合了最先进的情感检测方法来处理用户的音频和文本输入。从语调和语言分别检测到的情感状态通过一种新颖的方法融合，旨在最小化跨不同人群的可能模型分歧。",
