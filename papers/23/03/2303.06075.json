    "abstract": "Long-tailed classification poses a challenge due to its heavy imbalance in class probabilities and tail-sensitivity risks with asymmetric misprediction costs. Recent attempts have used re-balancing loss and ensemble methods, but they are largely heuristic and depend heavily on empirical results, lacking theoretical explanation.

This paper presents a general and principled framework from a Bayesian-decision-theory perspective, which unifies existing techniques including re-balancing and ensemble methods, and provides theoretical justifications for their effectiveness. From this perspective, we derive a novel objective based on the integrated risk and a Bayesian deep-ensemble approach to improve the accuracy of all classes, especially the \"tail\".

    "translated_abstract": "长尾分类由于类别概率的严重不平衡和对称错误预测成本存在尾部敏感风险而面临挑战。最近的尝试采用重新平衡损失和集成方法，但它们很大程度上是启发式的，并且严重依赖经验结果，缺乏理论解释。此外，现有方法忽略了决策损失，它刻画了与尾部类别相关的不同成本。本文提出了一个从贝叶斯决策理论的角度看待长尾分类的通用且有原则的框架，它统一了包括重新平衡和集成方法在内的现有技术，并为它们的有效性提供了理论上的证明。从这个角度看，我们基于综合风险导出了一个新的目标和一个贝叶斯深度集成方法，以提高所有类别的准确性，特别是“长尾”类别的准确性。此外，我们的框架允许任务自适应决策损失，从而提供了在不同任务中可证明的最优决策。",
