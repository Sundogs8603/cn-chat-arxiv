    "title": "Behavioral Machine Learning? Computer Predictions of Corporate Earnings also Overreact. (arXiv:2303.16158v1 [q-fin.ST])",
    "abstract": "There is considerable evidence that machine learning algorithms have better predictive abilities than humans in various financial settings. But, the literature has not tested whether these algorithmic predictions are more rational than human predictions. We study the predictions of corporate earnings from several algorithms, notably linear regressions and a popular algorithm called Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT). On average, GBRT outperformed both linear regressions and human stock analysts, but it still overreacted to news and did not satisfy rational expectation as normally defined. By reducing the learning rate, the magnitude of overreaction can be minimized, but it comes with the cost of poorer out-of-sample prediction accuracy. Human stock analysts who have been trained in machine learning methods overreact less than traditionally trained analysts. Additionally, stock analyst predictions reflect information not otherwise available to machine algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "大量证据表明，在金融领域中，机器学习算法的预测能力比人类更为准确。但是，文献并未测试算法预测是否更为理性。本文研究了几个算法（包括线性回归和一种名为Gradient Boosted Regression Trees的流行算法）对于公司盈利的预测结果。结果发现，GBRT平均胜过线性回归和人类股市分析师，但仍存在过度反应且无法满足理性预期标准。通过降低学习率，可最小程度上减少过度反应程度，但这会牺牲预测准确性。通过机器学习方法培训过的股市分析师比传统训练的分析师产生的过度反应较少。此外，股市分析师的预测反映出机器算法没有捕捉到的信息。",
