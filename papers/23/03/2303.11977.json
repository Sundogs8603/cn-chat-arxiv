    "translated_abstract": "共享单车正在全球范围内作为一种活跃，方便和可持续的交通方式而兴起。为了计划成功的共享单车系统（BSS），许多城市从小规模试点开始，并逐步扩大系统覆盖更多区域。对于基于站点的BSS，这意味着随着时间的推移基于现有站点规划新站点，这需要预测整个系统中这些新站点产生的旅行次数。先前的研究通常依赖于相对简单的回归或机器学习模型，在捕捉复杂空间关系方面受到限制。尽管在旅行需求预测方面，深度学习方法的文献越来越多，但它们大多是基于时序数据的短期预测，假设系统没有结构性变化。在本研究中，我们重点研究了BSS扩展的出行生成问题，并提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的方法来预测基于多源城市建筑和地理数据的站点需求。",
