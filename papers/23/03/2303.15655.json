    "translated_abstract": "链接预测任务旨在预测知识图谱中缺失的实体或关系，并且是下游应用程序的关键。现有的著名模型主要通过将知识图谱三元组表示为距离空间或语义空间来处理此任务。然而，它们不能充分捕捉头尾实体的信息，甚至不能很好地利用分层级别信息。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一个新的知识图谱嵌入模型，用于链接预测任务，即HIE，它同时将每个三元组（h，r，t）建模为距离测量空间和语义测量空间。此外，将HIE引入分层感知空间，以利用实体和关系的丰富分层信息，以获得更好的表示学习效果。具体而言，在距离空间中对头实体应用距离变换操作以获取尾实体，而不是基于平移的模型。",
