While BEHRT considers only diagnoses and patient age, we extend the feature space to several multimodal records, namely demographics, clinical characteristics, vital signs, smoking status, diagnoses, procedures, medications, and laboratory tests, by applying a novel method to unify the frequencies and temporal dimensions of the different features. We show that additional features significantly improve model performance for various downstream tasks in different diseases.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究引入了ExBEHRT，它是BEHRT（应用于电子病历的BERT）的扩展版本，并应用不同的算法来解释其结果。我们将特征空间从仅考虑诊断和患者年龄扩展到包括多种类型的记录，包括人口统计学、临床特征、生命体征、吸烟状态、诊断、手术、药物和实验室检查，并采用一种新方法来统一不同特征的频率和时间维度。我们展示了附加特征可以显著改善不同疾病下游任务的模型性能。为了保证模型的稳健性，我们使用了预期梯度的改进方法对模型预测结果进行解释，该方法以前未应用于将EHR数据与Transformer相结合，提供了比以前方法更细粒度的解释，如特征和令牌重要性。此外，通过对肿瘤学患者的模型表示进行聚类，我们展示了ExBEHRT可以用于预测疾病亚型和进展。",
