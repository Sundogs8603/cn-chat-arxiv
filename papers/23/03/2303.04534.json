    "abstract": "Weighted knowledge bases for description logics with typicality under a \"concept-wise\" multi-preferential semantics provide a logical interpretation of MultiLayer Perceptrons. In this context, Answer Set Programming (ASP) has been shown to be suitable for addressing defeasible reasoning in the finitely many-valued case, providing a $\\Pi^p_2$ upper bound on the complexity of the problem, nonetheless leaving unknown the exact complexity and only providing a proof-of-concept implementation. This paper fulfils the lack by providing a $P^{NP[log]}$-completeness result and new ASP encodings that deal with weighted knowledge bases with large search spaces.",
