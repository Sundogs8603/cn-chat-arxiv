    "abstract": "There is a surge in interest in the development of open-domain chatbots, driven by the recent advancements of large language models. The \"openness\" of the dialogue is expected to be maximized by providing minimal information to the users about the common ground they can expect, including the presumed joint activity. However, evidence suggests that the effect is the opposite. Asking users to \"just chat about anything\" results in a very narrow form of dialogue, which we refer to as the \"open-domain paradox\". In this paper, we explain this paradox through the theory of common ground as the basis for human-like communication. Furthermore, we question the assumptions behind open-domain chatbots and identify paths forward for enabling common ground in human-computer dialogue.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型的最新进展推动了开放领域聊天机器人的发展，其“开放性”预计通过向用户提供最少信息，包括假定的共同活动，来实现最大化。然而，证据表明效果相反。要求用户“闲聊任何事情”会导致非常狭窄的对话形式，我们称之为“开放领域悖论”。在本文中，我们通过共同基础理论解释了这个悖论作为实现类似人类对话的基础。此外，我们质疑开放领域聊天机器人背后的假设，并确定实现人机对话中共同基础的路径。",
    "tldr": "最近研究表明，开放领域聊天机器人通过提供最少信息来实现最大化的“开放性”，在实践中导致了“开放领域悖论”——-要求用户“闲聊任何事情”会导致非常狭窄的对话形式。此研究进一步解释了共同基础理论与实现类似人类对话的关系，并提出了实现共同基础的路径。"
