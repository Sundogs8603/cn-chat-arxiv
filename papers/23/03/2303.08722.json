    "translated_abstract": "顺序推荐系统是基于大量隐式用户反馈数据进行建模的，当用户系统地低估/高估某些项目时，会受到偏见的影响。提出了基于倒数倾向分数（IPS）的无偏学习方法，以解决这个问题。在这些方法中，倾向分数估计通常仅限于项目视图，即将反馈数据视为与用户互动的项目序列。然而，反馈数据也可以从用户的角度来看待，作为与项目互动的用户序列。此外，两个视角可以共同增强倾向分数的估计。受此观察的启发，我们提出了从用户和项目视角估计倾向分数的DEPS算法。具体而言，DEPS从用户视角和项目视角优化两个IPS估计器，并通过最小化其加权平均值的方差来减少偏差。在两个公共数据集上的实验结果表明DEPS在减少偏差和提高推荐精度方面具有有效性。",
