    "translated_abstract": "神经符号规则学习因其比纯神经模型具有更好的可解释性且比符号规则学习扩展性更好而受到关注。最近提出了一种名为 pix2rule 的方法，引入了一个神经范式模块来使用前向层学习符号规则。尽管在合成二分类方面证明了其有效性，但 pix2rule 尚未应用于更具挑战性的任务，如基于实际数据的多标签和多类分类。本文通过将神经范式模块扩展到以下三个方面来解决这一限制：(i) 支持实际多类和多标签分类任务的规则学习，(ii) 在多类分类中强制符号互斥属性(即预测恰好一个类)，以及(iii) 探索其在大输入输出方面的扩展性。我们使用类似于 pix2rule 的神经 DNF 模块训练了一个普通的神经 DNF 模型，用于多标签分类，同时提出了一种新方法来通过改进现有的神经 DNF 模块实现多类分类中的互斥性。在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，我们扩展的神经 DNF 模型在准确性和可解释性方面明显优于现有的神经符号规则学习模型以及纯神经模型和符号规则学习模型。",
