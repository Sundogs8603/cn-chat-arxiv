    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了NeuSE，这是一种用于对象的新颖的神经网络SE(3)-等变嵌入，并展示了它如何支持对象SLAM以实现与长期场景变化一致的空间理解。NeuSE是从部分对象观测中创建的一组潜在对象嵌入，在与物理世界中的对象同时SE(3)-等变变换的同时，它作为一个紧凑的点云替代完整的对象模型，编码了完整的形状信息。通过NeuSE，可以直接从推断的潜在代码中获得相对帧变换。我们提出的使用NeuSE进行对象形状和姿态特征化的SLAM范式可以独立运行或与典型的SLAM系统结合使用。它直接推断与普通SLAM姿态图优化兼容的SE(3)相机姿态约束，同时还维持了一个轻量级的以对象为中心的地图，能够适应现实世界的变化。我们的方法在包含改变的对象的合成和真实世界序列上进行了评估。",
