    "abstract": "Today, people use email services such as Gmail, Outlook, AOL Mail, etc. to communicate with each other as quickly as possible to send information and official letters. Spam or junk mail is a major challenge to this type of communication, usually sent by botnets with the aim of advertising, harming and stealing information in bulk to different people. Receiving unwanted spam emails on a daily basis fills up the inbox folder. Therefore, spam detection is a fundamental challenge, so far many works have been done to detect spam using clustering and text categorisation methods. In this article, the author has used the spaCy natural language processing library and 3 machine learning (ML) algorithms Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree C45 and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) in the Python programming language to detect spam emails collected from the Gmail service. Observations show the accuracy rate (96%) of the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm in spam detection.",

    "translated_abstract": "如今，人们使用Gmail、Outlook、AOL Mail等电子邮件服务快速相互沟通，发送信息和官方信函。垃圾邮件是这种通信的主要挑战，通常是由僵尸网络发送的，旨在向不同的人群广告、损害和窃取信息。每天收到大量不想要的垃圾邮件会填满收件箱文件夹。因此，垃圾邮件检测是一项基本的挑战，目前已经有许多工作使用聚类和文本分类方法来检测垃圾邮件。本文作者使用了spaCy自然语言处理库和Python编程语言中的3种机器学习（ML）算法朴素贝叶斯（NB）、决策树C45和多层感知器（MLP）来检测从Gmail服务收集的垃圾邮件。观察结果显示，多层感知器（MLP）算法在垃圾邮件检测中的准确率为96％。",
