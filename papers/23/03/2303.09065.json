    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了一种基于深度概率体系结构的算法，称为树形求和产品网络(t-SPN)，用于细胞分类。构建t-SPN的目的是表示未归一化概率作为最相似的细胞类别的条件概率。通过最大化边缘来学习构建的t-SPN体系结构，该边缘是真实标签和最有竞争力的错误标签之间的条件概率差。为了增强体系结构的泛化能力，在学习过程中考虑了L2正则化（REG）和最大间隔（MM）标准。为了突出细胞特征，本文探讨了两种通用的高通滤波器的有效性：理想高通滤波和拉普拉斯滤波(Log)。在HEp-2和Feulgen基准数据集上，基于最大间隔准则与正则化学习的t-SPN体系结构产生了最高的准确率。",

By maximizing the margin and considering L2 regularization, the method achieved the highest accuracy rate on HEp-2 and Feulgen benchmark datasets. The effectiveness of high-pass filters was also investigated."
