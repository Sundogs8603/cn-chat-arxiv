    "abstract": "Textual entailment models are increasingly applied in settings like fact-checking, presupposition verification in question answering, or summary evaluation. However, these represent a significant domain shift from existing entailment datasets, and models underperform as a result. We propose WiCE, a new fine-grained textual entailment dataset built on natural claim and evidence pairs extracted from Wikipedia. In addition to standard claim-level entailment, WiCE provides entailment judgments over sub-sentence units of the claim, and a minimal subset of evidence sentences that support each subclaim. To support this, we propose an automatic claim decomposition strategy using GPT-3.5 which we show is also effective at improving entailment models' performance on multiple datasets at test time. Finally, we show that real claims in our dataset involve challenging verification and retrieval problems that existing models fail to address.",

    "translated_abstract": "文本蕴含模型越来越多地应用于事实检查、问题回答中的预设验证或摘要评估等设置中。然而，这些应用与现有的蕴含数据集存在显著的领域转移，导致模型表现不佳。我们提出了WiCE，这是一个新的细粒度文本蕴含数据集，通过提取来自维基百科的自然声明和证据配对来构建。除了标准的声明级蕴含，WiCE还提供对声明子句的蕴含判断，以及支持每个子声明的最小证据句子子集。为了支持这一点，我们提出了一种使用GPT-3.5的自动声明分解策略，我们证明这种策略在测试时也能有效提高蕴含模型在多个数据集上的性能。最后，我们展示了我们数据集中真实声明涉及具有挑战性的验证和检索问题，现有模型无法解决。",
