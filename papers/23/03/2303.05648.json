Existing works typically assume that people evaluate items independently.

In this work, we identify three factors contributing to context effects: users' adaptive weights, the inter-item comparison, and display positions. We propose a context-dependent preference model named Pacos as a unified framework for addressing three factors simultaneously, and consider two design methods including an additive method with high interpretability and an ANN-based method with high accuracy. We study the conditions for preference reversa",

    "translated_abstract": "选择问题是指从多个项目中选择最佳选择，学习用户在选择问题中的偏好对于理解决策机制和提供个性化服务具有重要意义。现有的研究通常假设人们独立地评估项目。在实践中，但是用户的偏好取决于项目所处的市场，这被称为上下文效应；而用户对两个项目的偏好顺序甚至可能被颠倒，这被称为偏好逆转。本文识别了导致上下文效应的三个因素：用户的自适应权重、项目之间的比较和显示位置。我们提出了一个名为Pacos的上下文依赖偏好模型作为统一框架来同时解决这三个因素，并考虑了两种设计方法，包括具有高可解释性的加性方法和具有高准确性的基于ANN的方法。我们研究了基于各种市场情景和模型参数的偏好逆转条件，并展示了Pacos可以有效地捕捉偏好逆转。此外，Pacos可以提供上下文效应和用户自适应行为的可解释指示，有助于提供个性化服务。",
