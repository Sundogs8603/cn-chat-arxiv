    "abstract": "Depression is a common disease worldwide. It is difficult to diagnose and continues to be underdiagnosed. Because depressed patients constantly share their symptoms, major life events, and treatments on social media, researchers are turning to user-generated digital traces on social media for depression detection. Such methods have distinct advantages in combating depression because they can facilitate innovative approaches to fight depression and alleviate its social and economic burden. However, most existing studies lack effective means to incorporate established medical domain knowledge in depression detection or suffer from feature extraction difficulties that impede greater performance. Following the design science research paradigm, we propose a Deep Knowledge-aware Depression Detection (DKDD) framework to accurately detect social media users at risk of depression and explain the critical factors that contribute to such detection.

    "translated_abstract": "抑郁症是一种全球常见的疾病。它很难诊断，并且持续被低估。由于抑郁症患者在社交媒体上不断分享他们的症状、重大生活事件和治疗方法，研究人员开始利用社交媒体上用户生成的数字痕迹进行抑郁症检测。这种方法在抗击抑郁症方面具有独特的优势，因为它们可以促进创新的方法来对抗抑郁症并减轻其社会和经济负担。然而，大多数现有研究缺乏有效的手段将已建立的医学领域知识纳入抑郁症检测中，或者面临特征提取困难而影响性能。在设计科学研究范式的指导下，我们提出了一种深度知识感知的抑郁症检测 (DKDD) 框架，以准确检测社交媒体用户的抑郁风险，并解释对这种检测起关键作用的因素。通过真实数据进行了大量的实证研究。",
