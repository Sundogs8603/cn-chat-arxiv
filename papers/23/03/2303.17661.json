    "abstract": "Metadata quality is crucial for digital objects to be discovered through digital library interfaces. However, due to various reasons, the metadata of digital objects often exhibits incomplete, inconsistent, and incorrect values. We investigate methods to automatically detect, correct, and canonicalize scholarly metadata, using seven key fields of electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs) as a case study. We propose MetaEnhance, a framework that utilizes state-of-the-art artificial intelligence methods to improve the quality of these fields. To evaluate MetaEnhance, we compiled a metadata quality evaluation benchmark containing 500 ETDs, by combining subsets sampled using multiple criteria. We tested MetaEnhance on this benchmark and found that the proposed methods achieved nearly perfect F1-scores in detecting errors and F1-scores in correcting errors ranging from 0.85 to 1.00 for five of seven fields.",

    "translated_abstract": "数字对象的元数据质量对于通过数字库界面进行发现非常重要。但由于各种原因，数字对象的元数据通常展示出不完整、不一致和不正确的值。我们研究了自动检测、纠正和规范学术元数据的方法，以电子学位论文的七个关键字段为案例研究。我们提出了MetaEnhance，这是一个利用最先进的人工智能方法来提高这些字段质量的框架。为了评估MetaEnhance，我们编制了一个元数据质量评估基准，其中包含500个电子学位论文，通过多个标准进行采样子集来组合。我们对这个基准测试MetaEnhance，结果发现所提出的方法几乎完美地实现了错误检测的F1分数以及五个字段中的错误纠正的F1分数在0.85到1.00之间。",
