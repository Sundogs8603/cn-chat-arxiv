    "abstract": "This study presents a systematic machine learning approach for creating efficient hybrid models and discovering sorption uptake models in non-linear advection-diffusion-sorption systems. It demonstrates an effective method to train these complex systems using gradientbased optimizers, adjoint sensitivity analysis, and JIT-compiled vector Jacobian products, combined with spatial discretization and adaptive integrators. Sparse and symbolic regression were employed to identify missing functions in the artificial neural network. The robustness of the proposed method was tested on an in-silico data set of noisy breakthrough curve observations of fixed-bed adsorption, resulting in a well-fitted hybrid model. The study successfully reconstructed sorption uptake kinetics using sparse and symbolic regression, and accurately predicted breakthrough curves using identified polynomials, highlighting the potential of the proposed framework for discovering sorption kinetic law structures.",
