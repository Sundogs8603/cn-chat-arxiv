    "translated_abstract": "本论文介绍一种基于人工通用智能方法原则的通用单变量信号去卷积方法，该方法建立了一个模型生成模型，依赖于信息论和算法概率，并计算出“通用分布”的估计，从而独立于概率分布地构建了一个通用模型。该方法基于信息论和算法概率的多维空间重构，可以探究非随机数据如何编码关于物理性质的信息，例如信号或信息的维度和长度尺度。该方法是与可计算或半可计算的近似方法或编码-解码方案相关但不独立的。本文的结果对编码理论尤其是零失真压缩有应用意义。",

It constructs a generative model independent of probability distributions by computing an estimation of a \"universal distribution\". The method is agnostic to the chosen computable or semi-computable approximation method or encoding-decoding scheme and explores how non-random data may encode information about the physical properties of the signal or message. Its applications in coding theory, particularly in lossless compression, are significant."
