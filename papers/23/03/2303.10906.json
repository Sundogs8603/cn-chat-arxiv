    "translated_abstract": "为了保护用户的在线隐私，监管机构和浏览器越来越限制用户追踪。这种限制对卖广告空间以资助业务、包括内容的发布者有经济影响。根据对111家发行商涉及4200万次广告展示的分析，当用户追踪不可用时，发布者为广告展示所收到的原始价格下降了约60％。在控制用户、广告商和发布者的差异后，这种下降仍然很大，为18％。超过90％的发布者感到当他们无法进行用户追踪时，价格变低。提供广泛内容的发布者（如新闻网站）比提供主题内容的发布者更受用户追踪限制的影响。收集用户浏览历史记录被认为普遍具有侵入性，对发布者的价值微不足道。这些结果证实了保护用户在线隐私将对发布者的经济利益产生重大影响的预测。",
    "tldr": "发布者在追踪用户时为广告带来的收益将大幅下降，对大多数发布者来说，用户追踪限制会使价格降低，提供广泛内容的发布者受影响最大。",
