    "abstract": "Multi-input multi-out and non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA) internet-of-things (IoT) systems can improve channel capacity and spectrum efficiency distinctly to support the real-time applications. Age of information (AoI) is an important metric for real-time application, but there is no literature have minimized AoI of the MIMO-NOMA IoT system, which motivates us to conduct this work. In MIMO-NOMA IoT system, the base station (BS) determines the sample collection requirements and allocates the transmission power for each IoT device. Each device determines whether to sample data according to the sample collection requirements and adopts the allocated power to transmit the sampled data to the BS over MIMO-NOMA channel. Afterwards, the BS employs successive interference cancelation (SIC) technique to decode the signal of the data transmitted by each device. The sample collection requirements and power allocation would affect AoI and energy consumption of the system. It is critical",
