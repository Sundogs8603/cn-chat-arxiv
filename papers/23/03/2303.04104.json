    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种应用于呼吸声音记录中的异常检测的深度学习系统。我们的系统开始于使用Gammatone和Continuous Wavelet转换进行音频特征提取。这一步旨在将呼吸声音输入转换为二维频谱图，其中展现了谱和时域特征。然后，我们提出的系统将Inception-Residual-based的骨干模型与multi-head attention和multi-objective loss相结合，用于分类呼吸异常。我们提出了一种线性组合方法，而不是简单的连接方法，这种方法具有在整个训练过程中平衡每个单独频谱图贡献的能力。我们在IEEE BioCAS 2022挑战赛提出的SPRSound（开源SJTU儿科呼吸声音）基准数据集上进行实验评估。",
