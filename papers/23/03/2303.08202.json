Similar to the classical notion of deterministic rationality, our rationality ordering detects violations of (stochastic) transitivity as well as inconsistencies between choices from nested menus. We obtain an easy-to-use characterization of this ordering, and then use that characterization to introduce an index of stochastic rationality.
