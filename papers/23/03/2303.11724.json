    "abstract": "We present a method for selecting valuable projections in computed tomography (CT) scans to enhance image reconstruction and diagnosis. The approach integrates two important factors, projection-based detectability and data completeness, into a single feed-forward neural network. The network evaluates the value of projections, processes them through a differentiable ranking function and makes the final selection using a straight-through estimator. Data completeness is ensured through the label provided during training. The approach eliminates the need for heuristically enforcing data completeness, which may exclude valuable projections. The method is evaluated on simulated data in a non-destructive testing scenario, where the aim is to maximize the reconstruction quality within a specified region of interest. We achieve comparable results to previous methods, laying the foundation for using reconstruction-based loss functions to learn the selection of projections.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种方法来选择在计算机体层摄影（CT）扫描中具有价值的投影，以增强图像重建和诊断。该方法将投影检测能力和数据完整性两个重要因素集成到一个前向神经网络中。网络评估投影的价值，通过可微分排名函数对其进行处理，并使用直通估计器进行最终选择。通过训练提供的标签来确保数据完整性。该方法消除了启发式强制实现数据完整性的需求，因为这可能会排除有价值的投影。该方法在模拟数据的非破坏性测试场景中进行评估，其目的是在指定的感兴趣区域内最大化重建质量。我们实现了与以前方法可比较的结果，为使用基于重建的损失函数学习投影选择奠定了基础。",
