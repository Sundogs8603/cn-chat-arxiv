    "abstract": "Predicting how distributions over discrete variables vary over time is a common task in time series forecasting. But whereas most approaches focus on merely predicting the distribution at subsequent time steps, a crucial piece of information in many settings is to determine how this probability mass flows between the different elements over time. We propose a new approach to predicting such mass flow over time using optimal transport. Specifically, we propose a generic approach to predicting transport matrices in end-to-end deep learning systems, replacing the standard softmax operation with Sinkhorn iterations. We apply our approach to the task of predicting how communities will evolve over time in social network settings, and show that the approach improves substantially over alternative prediction methods. We specifically highlight results on the task of predicting faction evolution in Ukrainian parliamentary voting.",

    "translated_abstract": "在时间序列预测中，预测离散变量分布如何随时间变化是一个普遍的任务。但是，大多数方法仅集中于预测随后时间步骤的分布，而在许多情况下，确定这种概率质量在不同元素之间随时间流动的方式是一项关键信息。我们提出了一种使用最优输运预测这种质量流量随时间变化的新方法。具体而言，我们提出了一种通用的端到端深度学习系统中预测输运矩阵的方法，用 Sinkhorn 迭代替换标准的 softmax 操作。我们将我们的方法应用于在社交网络设置中预测社区将如何随时间演变的任务，并表明该方法在改进替代预测方法方面具有实质性的进展。我们特别强调了在预测乌克兰议会投票中派系演变任务方面的结果。",
