    "abstract": "This paper reanalyzes Khanna (2023), which studies labor market effects of schooling in India through a regression discontinuity design. In graphical preliminaries, reversing overrides of the plotting software's defaults greatly reduces the appearance of discontinuities. Absent from the data are four districts close to the discontinuity; restoring them cuts the reduced-form impacts on schooling and log wages by 62% and 75%. Using a consistent variance estimator, and clustering it at the geographic unit of treatment, further weakens the inference of positive impact. The estimates of general equilibrium effects and elasticities of substitution are not unbiased and have effectively infinite variance.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文重新分析了 Khanna (2023) 中通过回归不连续设计研究印度教育对劳动力市场的影响的内容。在图形初步分析中，反转绘图软件默认值的覆盖极大地减少了不连续性的出现。在数据中缺少离不连续点四个街区；修复后削减了对学校和对数工资的简化形式影响分别为62％和75％。使用一致的方差估计器，并将其聚类处理到地理治疗单元，进一步削弱了积极影响的推断。一般均衡效应和替代弹性的估计不是无偏的，且有效方差为无限大。",
