    "translated_abstract": "基于模型的强化学习/控制在机器人领域获得了显著的关注。然而，这些方法通常在数据效率和缺乏手工设计解决方案的可解释性方面存在问题。这使得它们在安全关键环境中难以调试/集成。然而，在许多系统中，环境运动学/动力学的先验知识是可用的。通过整合这些先验知识，可以通过减少问题复杂性和探索需求，同时促进代理所做决策以物理上有意义的实体来表达，有助于解决上述问题。我们的目标是通过一个案例研究来阐明和支持这一观点。我们基于一个真实机器人系统模拟了一个载荷操纵问题，并展示了在 MPC 框架中利用关于环境动态的先验知识可以改善可解释性、安全性和数据效率，从而实现更安全、更高效的操纵。",
