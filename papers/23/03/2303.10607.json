    "translated_abstract": "针对发展自动化疼痛识别感知系统，研究者越来越关注疼痛的生理反应。虽然较少被探索，但血容积脉搏（BVP）是一个可能有助于客观疼痛评估的生理测量候选。本研究中，我们对BVP信号应用机器学习技术，设想了一种非侵入式的疼痛感知方式。32名健康受试者参与了本研究。首先，我们研究了一组新颖的时间域、频率域和非线性动力学特征，这些特征潜在地对疼痛具有敏感性。这些包括来自BVP信号的24个特征和从同一BVP信号中导出的20个额外的心跳间隔（IBI）特征。利用这些特征，我们构建了机器学习模型来检测疼痛的存在和其强度。我们探索了不同的机器学习模型，包括逻辑回归、随机森林、支持向量机、自适应提升（AdaBoost）。",
