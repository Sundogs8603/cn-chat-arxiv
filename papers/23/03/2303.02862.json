In this paper, we propose EvHandPose with novel hand flow representations in Event-to-Pose module for accurate hand pose estimation and alleviating the motion ambiguity issue. To solve the problem under sparse annotation, we design contrast maximization and hand-edge constraints in Pose-to-IWE (Image with Warped Events) module and formulate EvHandPose in a weakly-supervision framework.

    "translated_abstract": "事件相机在3D手势姿势估计中显示出了巨大的潜力，尤其在解决快速运动和高动态范围的挑战以低功耗方式处理时。然而，由于异步差分成像机制，设计事件表示来编码手部运动信息尤其是当手部不动时（导致运动模糊）是具有挑战性的，并且不可能对时间密集的事件流进行完全注释。在本文中，我们提出了EvHandPose，用于准确的手势姿势估计和减轻运动模糊问题的新型手部流表示。为了解决稀疏注释下的问题，我们在Pose-to-IWE（具有扭曲事件的图像）模块中设计了对比度最大化和手边缘约束，并将EvHandPose构建为弱监督框架。我们还构建了EvRealHands，首个针对几个具有挑战性场景的大规模真实世界事件驱动手势姿势数据集，以填补真实合成领域间的差距。",
