    "translated_abstract": "第五届情感行为分析(ABAW)比赛是该领域相应的ABAW研讨会的一部分，该研讨会将与IEEE计算机视觉和模式识别会议(CVPR)2023年联合举办。ABAW 5比赛是ECCV 2022、IEEE CVPR 2022、ICCV 2021、IEEE FG 2020和CVPR 2017会议上举办的比赛的延续，旨在自动分析情感。为今年的比赛，我们提供了两个数据集：i) Aff-Wild2数据库的扩展版本和ii) Hume-Reaction数据库。前者是一个包含约600个视频、约300万帧的视听数据集，针对以下方面进行了注释：a) 两个连续的情感维度——情感价值(一个人的积极/消极程度)和情感唤醒度(一个人的活跃/被动程度)——；b) 基本表情(例如快乐、悲伤、中性状态)；和c) 原子人脸肌肉动作(即，动作单元)。后者数据集捕捉了个体对自然环境中事件的反应。ABAW比赛提出了三个子任务：情感价值-唤醒度估计、表情识别和动作单元检测，以及一个新的子任务，情感反应强度估计。参赛团队需要开发和评估能在具有挑战性和较少控制的环境中运行的模型。",

Participants are required to develop and evaluate models that can operate effectively in challenging and less-controlled environments."
