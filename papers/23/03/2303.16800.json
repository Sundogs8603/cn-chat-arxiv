    "translated_abstract": "当进行回归模型估计时，可能会出现一些标签缺失的数据，或者我们的数据可能会受到选择机制的偏差影响。当响应或选择机制是可忽略的（即，在给定特征的情况下，独立于响应变量），可以使用现成的回归方法；在不可忽略的情况下，通常必须进行偏差调整。我们观察到，特权数据（即只在训练期间可用的数据）可能会使不可忽略的选择机制可忽略，并将这种情况称为特权缺失随机（PMAR）。我们提出了一种新的基于插补的回归方法，称为重复回归，适用于PMAR。我们还考虑了一种重要性加权回归方法和两种方法的双重稳健组合。所提出的方法易于使用大多数流行的现成回归算法进行实现。我们通过大量的模拟实验和对Eye State数据集的实证评估来评估所提出的方法的性能。",
