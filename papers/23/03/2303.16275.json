    "abstract": "Intelligent writing assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) are more popular today than ever before, but their further widespread adoption is precluded by sub-optimal performance. In this position paper, we argue that a major reason for this sub-optimal performance and adoption is a singular focus on the information content of language while ignoring its social aspects. We analyze the different dimensions of these social factors in the context of writing assistants and propose their incorporation into building smarter, more effective, and truly personalized writing assistants that would enrich the user experience and contribute to increased user adoption.",

    "translated_abstract": "根据这篇文章，智能写作助手在当今比以往任何时候都更受欢迎，但他们的进一步普及受到亚优化表现的限制。作者们认为造成这种状态的主要原因是只关注语言的信息内容而忽略了其社会因素。本文分析了这些社会因素在写作助手中的不同方面，并提出将其纳入更智能、更有效和真正个性化的写作助手的建设中，从而丰富用户体验并促进用户采纳。",
