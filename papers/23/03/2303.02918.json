    "translated_abstract": "为了增强GNN，已经研究了两种主要的节点特征增强方案：随机特征和谱位置编码。然而，令人惊讶的是，这两种增强方案之间的关系仍然没有清晰的理解。在这里，我们提出了一种新颖的位置编码方案，它建立了上述两种方法之间的联系，并改进了它们。这种名为Random Feature Propagation (RFP)的新方法受到了幂迭代方法及其推广的启发。它将用于计算传播矩阵的主特征向量的迭代算法的几个中间步骤进行串联，从随机节点特征开始。值得注意的是，这些传播步骤是基于图相关的传播算子的，这些算子可以是预定义的，也可以是学习得到的。我们探讨了RFP的理论和经验优势。首先，我们为使用随机特征、将早期传播步骤纳入考虑以及使用图相关的传播算子提供了理论上的证明。",
