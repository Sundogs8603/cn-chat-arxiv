    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于深度学习的端到端语音识别技术迅速发展。由于缺乏土耳其语音数据，土耳其语音识别系统的性能较差。本文研究了一系列语音识别调优技术。首先，实验结果表明，当采用将速度扰动和噪声添加相结合的数据增强技术并将波束搜索宽度设置为16时，模型的性能最佳。其次，为充分利用有效特征信息、提高特征提取准确性，本文提出了一种新的特征提取器LSPC。并通过将LSPC和LiGRU网络相结合构成共享编码器结构实现模型压缩。最后，在以上两点基础上，提出了一个新的多特征融合网络。该网络提出了混合CTC/Attention架构，使模型兼具两者的优点，并有效地结合了不同的声学特征，比使用单一特征更具实验效果。实验结果表明，该模型在作者开发的土耳其语音语料库上取得了最先进的性能。",
