    "translated_abstract": "最近，深度学习已经在使用内窥镜图像进行肾结石分类方面取得了令人鼓舞的结果。然而，缺乏注释的训练数据对于改善训练模型的性能和泛化能力构成了严重问题。因此，充分利用手头有限的数据是至关重要的。本文提出了SegPrompt，通过从两个方面利用分割图来缓解数据短缺问题。首先，SegPrompt整合了分割图以便于分类训练，使分类模型能够意识到感兴趣的区域。所提出的方法允许图像和分割令牌相互交互，以充分利用分割图信息。其次，我们使用分割图作为提示来微调预训练的深度模型，结果可训练参数比香草微调少得多。我们在收集的肾结石数据集上进行了广泛的实验。结果表明，SegPrompt可以显著提高分类性能，同时需要比以前的方法少得多的注释数据。",
