    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel representation for grasping using contacts between multi-finger robotic hands and objects to be manipulated. This representation significantly reduces the prediction dimensions and accelerates the learning process. We present an effective end-to-end network, CMG-Net, for grasping unknown objects in a cluttered environment by efficiently predicting multi-finger grasp poses and hand configurations from a single-shot point cloud. Moreover, we create a synthetic grasp dataset that consists of five thousand cluttered scenes, 80 object categories, and 20 million annotations. We perform a comprehensive empirical study and demonstrate the effectiveness of our grasping representation and CMG-Net. Our work significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art for three-finger robotic hands. We also demonstrate that the model trained using synthetic data performs very well for real robots.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的抓取表述方式，使用机器手指与待操作物体之间的接触点。该表述方式显著减少了预测维度并加速了学习过程。我们提出了一种有效的端到端网络CMG-Net，可以从单个点云中高效地预测多指抓取姿势和手型配置，用于在杂乱环境中抓取未知物体。此外，我们创建了一个综合的、包含五千个杂乱场景、80个物体类别和2000万注释的合成抓取数据集。我们进行了全面的实证研究，并展示了我们的抓取表述方式和CMG-Net的有效性。我们的工作在三指机器手的领域中明显优于现有的最佳工作。我们还证明使用合成数据训练的模型在实际机器人中的表现非常好。",
