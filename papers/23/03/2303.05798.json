Learning with these matrices requires using Riemanian geometry to account for their structure. In this paper, we propose a new method to deal with distributions of covariance matrices and demonstrate its computational efficiency on M/EEG multivariate time series. More specifically, we define a Sliced-Wasserstein distance between measures of symmetric positive definite matrices that comes with strong theoretical guarantees. Then, we take advantage of its properties and kernel methods to apply this distance to brain-age prediction from MEG data and compare it to state-of-the-art algorithms based on Riemannian geometry. Finally, we show that it is an efficient surrogate to the Wasserstein distance in domain adaptation for Brain Computer Interface applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "在处理电或者磁性脑电图记录时，许多监督式预测任务通过使用协方差矩阵来汇总信号进行解决。使用这些矩阵进行学习需要使用伽马尼几何来说明它们的结构。本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法来处理协方差矩阵的分布，并且在M / EEG多元时间序列上展示了其计算效率。更具体地，我们定义了测量对称正定矩阵之间的切片Wasserstein距离，并提供了强大的理论保证。然后，我们利用其属性和内核方法将此距离应用于从MEG数据预测脑龄，并将其与基于Riemannian几何的最新算法进行了比较。最后，我们展示在领域适应的大脑计算机界面应用中，它可以是Wasserstein距离的有效替代品。",
