    "translated_abstract": "基于框架语义的方法已经成为语义解析任务中的主流方法，但是在不同的上下文中消歧目标词汇所唤起的框架表示仍然具有挑战性。预训练语言模型（PLMs）已被用于语义解析，并且显著提高了神经解析器的准确性。然而，基于PLMs的方法往往偏爱训练数据中出现的联合模式，导致输出结果不准确。本文提出了一种新颖的基于知识增强的框架语义解析体系结构，通过将精确的框架知识与PLMs结合，增强了语义表示。具体来说，设计了一个基于记忆的知识提取模块（MKEM）来选择准确的框架知识并在高级语言表示层中构建连续模板。然后，采用混合提示调整机制来引导神经网络将带有语义领域知识的内容集成到输出结果中。实验结果表明，这种方法在多个数据集上实现了优越的性能。",
