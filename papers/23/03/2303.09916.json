Many traditional and machine-learning based methods are available to fulfil the docking task. The traditional docking methods are normally extensively time-consuming, and their performance in blind docking remains to be improved. Although the runtime of docking based on machine learning is significantly decreased, their accuracy is still limited. In this study, we take the advantage of both traditional and machine-learning based methods, and present a method Deep Site and Docking Pose (DSDP) to improve the performance of blind docking. For the traditional blind docking, the entire protein is covered by a cube, and the initial positions of ligands are randomly generated in the cube. In contract, DSDP can predict the binding site of proteins and provide an accurate searching space and initial positions for the further conformational sampling. The docking task of DSDP makes use of the score function",

    "translated_abstract": "虚拟筛选，包括分子对接，在药物研发中起着至关重要的作用。许多传统的和基于机器学习的方法可用于完成对接任务。传统的对接方法通常需要大量的时间，并且它们在盲对接中的性能有待改进。虽然基于机器学习的对接运行时间显着缩短，但它们的准确性仍然有限。在本研究中，我们利用传统和基于机器学习的方法的优点，提出了一种深度位点和对接姿态(DSDP)的方法来改进盲对接的性能。对于传统的盲对接，整个蛋白质被一个立方体覆盖，配体的初始位置在立方体中随机生成。相反，DSDP可以预测蛋白质的结合位点并提供准确的搜索空间和初始位置，以进行进一步的构象采样。DSDP的对接任务利用得分函数",
