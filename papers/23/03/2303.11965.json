It was shown that students who know how and when to use each strategy (StrTime) outperformed those who know neither and stick to the default strategy (Default). In this work, students were trained on a logic tutor that supports a default forward-chaining and a backward-chaining (BC) strategy, then a probability tutor that only supports BC. We investigated three types of interventions on teaching the Default students how and when to use which strategy on the logic tutor: Example, Nudge and Presented. Meanwhile, StrTime students received no interventions. Overall, our results show that Nudge outperformed their Default peers and caught up with StrTime on both tutors.",

    "translated_abstract": "认证域通常具有很多认知技能，其中没有一种单一的解决策略可适用于解决所有问题。研究表明，知道何时如何使用每种策略的学生（StrTime）表现优于那些谁不知道并坚持默认策略（Default）的学生。在这项工作中，学生在逻辑辅导员的训练中使用默认的前向链接和后向链接（BC）策略，然后在概率辅导员中只使用BC支持的策略。我们研究了三种在逻辑辅导员上教授默认学生何时如何使用哪种策略的干预措施：示例、推动和提出。同时，StrTime学生没有接受任何干预措施。总的来说，我们的结果表明，Nudge的表现优于其Default同伴，并在两个辅导员上追赶StrTime。",
