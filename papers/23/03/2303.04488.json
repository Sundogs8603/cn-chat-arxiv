Previous works often use intricate symbolic methods, rely on domain knowledge, and require significant engineering effort to solve this task. In this work, we show that Magnushammer, a neural transformer-based approach, can outperform traditional symbolic systems by a large margin. Tested on the PISA benchmark, Magnushammer achieves $59.5\\%$ proof rate compared to a $38.3\\%$ proof rate of Sledgehammer, the most mature and popular symbolic-based solver. Furthermore, by combining Magnushammer with a neural formal prover based on a language model, we significantly improve the previous state-of-the-art proof rate from $57.0\\%$ to $71.0\\%$.",

    "translated_abstract": "前提选择是自动定理证明的一个基本问题。以往的方法常常使用复杂的符号方法，依赖领域知识，并需要大量的工程工作来解决这个任务。在这项工作中，我们展示了基于神经转换器的Magnushammer方法可以大幅度地超越传统的符号系统。通过在PISA基准上的测试，Magnushammer的证明率达到了59.5％，而最成熟和流行的基于符号的求解器Sledgehammer的证明率只有38.3％。此外，通过将Magnushammer与基于语言模型的神经形式证明器相结合，我们将先前最先进的证明率从57.0％大幅提高到71.0％。",
