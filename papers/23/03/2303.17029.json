    "abstract": "Using administrative data on Taiwanese lottery winners, this paper examines the effects of cash windfalls on entrepreneurship. We compare the start-up decisions of households winning more than 1.5 million NTD (50,000 USD) in the lottery in a particular year with those of households winning less than 15,000 NTD (500 USD). Our results suggest that a substantial windfall increases the likelihood of starting a business by 1.5 percentage points (125% from the baseline mean). Startup wealth elasticity is 0.25 to 0.36. Moreover, households who tend to be liquidity-constrained drive the windfall-induced entrepreneurial response. Finally, we examine how households with a business react to a cash windfall and find that serial entrepreneurs are more likely to start a new business but do not change their decision to continue the current business.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文利用台湾彩票获奖者的行政数据，考察现金盈利对创业的影响。我们将在特定年份中赢得超过150万新台币（50,000美元）彩票的家庭的创业决策与赢得不到15,000新台币（500美元）的家庭相比较。结果表明，丰厚的盈利增加了1.5个百分点（从基线平均值增加了125%）的创业可能性。创业财富弹性为0.25至0.36。此外，流动性受限的家庭驱动了盈利引发的创业反应。最后，我们研究了拥有企业的家庭如何应对现金盈利，并发现连续创业家更有可能开始一家新业务，但不会改变他们继续经营当前业务的决策。",
