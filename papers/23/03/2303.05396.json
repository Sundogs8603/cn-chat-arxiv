    "abstract": "We present two methods for bounding the probabilities of benefit and harm under unmeasured confounding. The first method computes the (upper or lower) bound of either probability as a function of the observed data distribution and two intuitive sensitivity parameters which, then, can be presented to the analyst as a 2-D plot to assist her in decision making. The second method assumes the existence of a measured nondifferential proxy (i.e., direct effect) of the unmeasured confounder. Using this proxy, tighter bounds than the existing ones can be derived from just the observed data distribution.",
