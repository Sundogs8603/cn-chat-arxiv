    "translated_abstract": "深度学习在诊断COVID-19方面非常有效，但需要大量数据进行有效训练。由于数据和隐私法规的限制，医院一般无法访问其他医院的数据。联邦学习（FL）已被用来解决这个问题，它利用分布式的方式在医院中进行模型训练，以保护隐私。但是，部署FL并不总是可行的，因为它需要高计算和网络通信资源。本文评估了五种FL算法在COVID-19检测方面的性能和资源效率。我们搭建了一个带有CNN网络的分散式环境，并将FL算法的性能与集中式环境进行了比较。我们研究了参与者数量、联邦轮数和选择算法等因素对算法性能的影响。结果表明，循环权重传递可以获得更好的总体性能，在参与医院较少的情况下结果更好。我们的结果展示了FL算法在分散式环境中对COVID-19检测具有良好的性能和效率。",
