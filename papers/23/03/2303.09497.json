    "translated_abstract": "健康状态评估是确保电池安全可靠运行的关键步骤。由于不同周期中出现数据分布和序列长度变化等问题，大多数现有方法需要进行健康特征提取技术，而这可能耗时且费力。门控循环单元（GRU）由于其简单的结构和卓越的性能而得到了广泛关注，并能很好地解决这个问题。然而，网络中仍存在冗余信息，影响SOH评估的准确性。为了解决这个问题，提出了一种基于Hilbert-Schmidt独立准则（GRU-HSIC）的新型GRU网络。首先，使用零掩码网络将每个周期测量的电池数据转换为相同长度的序列，同时仍保留每个周期原始数据大小的信息。其次，使用从信息瓶颈（IB）理论演变而来的Hilbert-Schmidt独立准则（HSIC）瓶颈从序列中提取最相关和独立的特征。最后，使用提取的特征训练GRU-HSIC模型以准确估计电池的SOH。实验结果表明，该方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。",
