    "abstract": "Existing weakly supervised sound event detection (WSSED) work has not explored both types of co-occurrences simultaneously, i.e., some sound events often co-occur, and their occurrences are usually accompanied by specific background sounds, so they would be inevitably entangled, causing misclassification and biased localization results with only clip-level supervision. To tackle this issue, we first establish a structural causal model (SCM) to reveal that the context is the main cause of co-occurrence confounders that mislead the model to learn spurious correlations between frames and clip-level labels. Based on the causal analysis, we propose a causal intervention (CI) method for WSSED to remove the negative impact of co-occurrence confounders by iteratively accumulating every possible context of each class and then re-projecting the contexts to the frame-level features for making the event boundary clearer. Experiments show that our method effectively improves the performance on mult",
