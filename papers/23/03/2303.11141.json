Specifically, we redesign a hierarchical entity type schema including 11 coarse-grained types and 119 fine-grained types, and then re-annotate DocRED manually according to this schema.

    "translated_abstract": "联合实体和关系抽取（JERE）是信息抽取中最重要的任务之一。然而，大多数现有的工作都集中在句子级别的粗粒度JERE上，在现实场景中存在一定局限性。本文构建了一个大规模的文档级细粒度JERE数据集DocRED-FE，该数据集通过细粒度实体类型来改进DocRED。具体而言，我们重新设计了一个分层的实体类型模式，包括11个粗粒度类型和119个细粒度类型，然后根据该模式手动重新注释了DocRED。通过全面的实验，我们发现：（1）对现有的JERE模型而言，DocRED-FE非常具有挑战性；（2）我们的细粒度实体类型可以提高关系分类的性能。我们在https://github.com/PKU-TANGENT/DOCRED-FE上提供了DocRED-FE的指令和我们基线模型的代码。",
