    "translated_abstract": "在开放世界的应用中，OOD（out-of-distribution）检测是部署机器学习模型的一个关键方面。经验证明，使用辅助离群值训练可以显著提高OOD检测性能。然而，这些离群值通常与测试OOD数据存在分布差距，并且不能覆盖所有可能的测试OOD情况。此外，结合这些离群值还会增加训练的负担。本文提出了一种称为测试时OOD检测的新范式，该范式直接利用未标记的在线数据，以提高OOD检测性能。虽然这种范式很高效，但它也面临着诸如灾难性遗忘等挑战。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了自适应离群值优化（AUTO），它由内外感知滤波器、ID存储器和语义一致的目标组成。AUTO自适应地从测试数据中挖掘伪ID和伪OOD样本，利用它们来优化网络参数并在线检测OOD样本。实验结果表明，AUTO在各种基准和数据集上始终优于现有方法。",
