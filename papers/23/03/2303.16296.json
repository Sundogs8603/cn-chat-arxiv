    "translated_abstract": "在医学成像领域的许多自动分割方案中，软Dice损失（SDL）发挥了关键作用。在过去几年中，人们已经揭示了其优越性能背后的一些原因并进一步探索了其优化。然而，目前还没有实现支持直接在软标签设置中使用它的方案。因此，在使用SDL和研究利用软标签的同时进行模型校准的协同作用仍然缺失。在本文中，我们介绍了Dice半度量损失函数（DMLs），它们（i）在硬标签的标准设置下与SDL相同，但（ii）也可在软标签设置中使用。我们在公共的QUBIQ、LiTS和KiTS基准测试上的实验证实了DMLs与软标签（如平均、标签平滑和知识蒸馏）的潜在协同作用，而DMLs与硬标签（如大多数投票和随机选择）相比，产生了更优秀的Dice分数和模型校准。",
    "tldr": "本文提出的Dice半度量损失函数可在软标签设置中使用，在医疗成像领域的分割方案中与使用软标签的研究相结合，可以获得更好的Dice分数和模型校准。",

The DMLs complement research on the use of soft labels and offer potential synergy with them."
