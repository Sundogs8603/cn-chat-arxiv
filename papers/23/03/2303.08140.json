    "translated_abstract": "直到最近，传统的生物染色一直被视为与临床诊断、基础研究和生物技术相关的大多数生物医学问题的业已确立的基准。尽管作为黄金标准的角色，但染色协议面临着一些挑战，如需要对样品进行广泛、手动处理、长时间延迟、改变组织稳态、对于给定样品的对比剂选择有限，只能进行二维成像而非三维断层扫描等。另一方面，不需要外源性和人工标记物的无标记光学技术，通过利用内在的光学对比机制，其特异性通常对人类观察者不太明显。在过去几年中，数字染色已经成为一个有前途的概念，利用现代深度学习将光学对比转化为实际染色的基础对比。在这篇综述文章中，我们提供了对当前数字染色方法和技术的深入分析。",
