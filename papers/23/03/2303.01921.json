    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个代理人连续面临的放置或不放置对机构信任的决策问题。代理人使用贝叶斯学习来估计机构的真实值和根据目光狭窄的合理性来决定是否放置信任。使用了随机游动理论的元素，我们明确推导了这样一个代理人在关系中何时停止放置信任的概率，以及在放置信任停止之后所花费的预期时间。然后，我们继续建模了两个信任者代理人，他们各自与机构建立了关系。我们考虑了两种信任者之间的自然交流模式。在第一种（“可观察奖励”）中，代理人彼此披露与机构的经验，而在第二种（“可观察动作”）中，代理人仅目睹他们邻居的行动，即是放置或不放置信任。在与单一代理人情况下的相同假设下。",
