    "translated_abstract": "函数回归分析是许多当代科学应用的已建立工具。涉及大规模和复杂数据集的回归问题是普遍存在的，特征选择对于避免过度拟合和实现准确预测至关重要。我们提出了一种新的、灵活的、超高效的方法，用于在稀疏高维函数回归问题中执行特征选择，并展示了如何将其扩展到标量对函数框架中。我们的方法将函数数据、优化和机器学习技术相结合，以同时执行特征选择和参数估计。我们利用函数主成分的特性以及对偶增广Lagrangian问题的稀疏性质，显著降低了计算成本，并引入了自适应方案来提高选择准确性。通过广泛的模拟研究，我们将我们的方法与最佳现有竞争对手进行了基准测试，并证明了我们的方法的高效性。",
