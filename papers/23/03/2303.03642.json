    "translated_abstract": "双赢公平性范式倡导一种同时满足前后两种可取性质的方法。我们在重要的社会选择场景中引入了一个双赢公平性的观点，即基于批准的委员会投票。为此，我们在该领域中提出了前期比例代表性属性，并形式化了一系列属性的层次结构，其中包括个体公平份额 (IFS)、一致公平份额 (UFS)、群体公平份额 (GFS) 及其更强的变体。我们证明了它们与后期概念的兼容性，如扩展合理代表性 (EJR) 和全权代表性 (FJR)。我们的主要结果之一是一个多项式时间算法，能同时满足后期 EJR、前期 GFS 和前期强UFS。随后，我们进一步加强了后期的保证，提出了一个输出彩票的算法，该彩票满足后期 FJR 和前期强 UFS，但不在多项式时间内运行。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method to achieve both ex-ante and ex-post fairness in committee voting, and formalizes a hierarchy of properties for this purpose. The paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm that satisfies ex-post extended justified representation, ex-ante group fair share, and ex-ante strong unanimous fair share. Additionally, an algorithm is presented that outputs a lottery satisfying ex-post fully justified representation and ex-ante strong unanimous fair share, but with non-polynomial running time."
