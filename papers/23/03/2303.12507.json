    "translated_abstract": "在许多基于地理位置的服务如目的地预测和路线规划中，预测下一个位置是一项非常有价值和常见的需求。下一个位置推荐的目标是根据用户的历史轨迹预测用户将要去的下一个兴趣点。大多数现有模型仅从用户的历史签到序列中学习移动模式，而忽视了用户偏好建模的重要性。本文提出了一种新颖的 POIFormer 模型来进行端到端下一位置推荐，其中包括对比用户偏好建模。该模型由三个主要模块组成：历史编码器、查询生成器和偏好解码器。历史编码器旨在从历史签到序列中建模移动模式，而查询生成器明确学习用户偏好以生成用户特定的意图查询。最后，偏好解码器将意图查询和历史信息组合起来进行个性化推荐。在真实数据集上的实验表明，所提出的模型优于现有的最先进方法，并有效地捕捉到用户的个性化偏好。",
