    "translated_abstract": "当前的顺序推荐系统利用各种神经技术（如Transformer和图神经网络（GNN））解决动态用户偏好学习的问题。然而，来自高度稀疏用户行为数据的推论可能会妨碍顺序模式编码的表征能力。为了解决标签短缺问题，最近提出了对比学习（CL）方法，以两种方式进行数据增强：（i）随机损坏序列数据（例如随机遮罩、重排序）；（ii）在预定义的对比视图之间对齐表示。虽然有效，但我们认为当前基于CL的方法在解决流行度偏见和用户一致性与真实兴趣相分离方面存在局限性。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的无偏差的推荐对比学习范式（DCRec），通过自适应一致性感知增强将顺序模式编码与全局协作关系建模相统一。这使得DCRec能够去除由于流行度效应而引起的隐式反馈的偏差，并提取用户的真实兴趣。对四个真实世界数据集的大量实验证明，DCRec提高了推荐质量，并优于最先进的方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new Debiased Contrastive learning paradigm called DCRec, which unifies sequential pattern encoding with global collaborative relation modeling through adaptive conformity-aware augmentation. It addresses the limitations of current contrastive learning methods in removing popularity bias and disentangling user behavior, and improves recommendation quality, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on four real-world datasets."
