    "translated_abstract": "过去十年中，按需乘车服务或乘车共享服务飞速发展。已经开发了各种数学模型和优化算法，帮助乘车共享平台设计更高效的运营策略。然而，由于成本和可靠性问题（对于真实操作实现不成熟的算法可能导致系统波动），在实际世界乘车共享平台内验证这些模型并训练/测试这些优化算法通常是不可行的。作为一个有用的测试平台，乘车共享系统的模拟平台将非常重要，以通过试验和误差进行算法训练/测试或模型验证。尽管先前的研究已经为他们自己的任务建立了各种模拟器，但缺少一个公正和公开的平台来比较不同研究人员提出的模型或算法。此外，现有的模拟器面临许多挑战，从灵活性、可扩展性到真实度都有。在本文中，我们介绍了一种用于按需乘车服务操作的多功能模拟平台，其具有高度的模块化、可扩展性和灵活性，能够实现各种用户场景和系统配置。我们通过几个案例研究展示了我们平台的有用性，包括操作效率和公平性评估，优化算法调整以及实时动态操作控制。我们的平台不仅为研究人员提供了一个比较各种算法和模型的公共平台，而且还可以由实践者直接使用，以提高他们的操作效率和用户体验。",
