    "translated_abstract": "基于LiDAR点云的三维识别已经在各种应用中得到了广泛的应用。当前大多数方法并没有专门考虑LiDAR点分布的情况，因此对于稀疏的远距离点经常面临信息不连通和有限感受野的问题。本文研究了LiDAR点分布的不同稀疏性，并提出了SphereFormer，可直接从密集的近距离点聚合信息和稀疏的远距离点。我们设计了径向窗口自注意力机制，将空间划分为多个非重叠窄长窗口。它可以克服不连通问题，平滑且显着地扩大感受野，从而显著提高稀疏远距离点的性能。此外，为了适应窄长窗口，我们提出指数分裂方法以得到细粒度的位置编码和动态特征选择以提高模型表征能力。值得注意的是，我们的方法在nuScenes和SemanticKITTI语义分割数据集上均名列前茅。",
