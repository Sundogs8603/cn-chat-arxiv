    "abstract": "In this paper, we present AR3n (pronounced as Aaron), an assist-as-needed (AAN) controller that utilizes reinforcement learning to supply adaptive assistance during a robot assisted handwriting rehabilitation task. Unlike previous AAN controllers, our method does not rely on patient specific controller parameters or physical models. We propose the use of a virtual patient model to generalize AR3n across multiple subjects. The system modulates robotic assistance in realtime based on a subject's tracking error, while minimizing the amount of robotic assistance. The controller is experimentally validated through a set of simulations and human subject experiments. Finally, a comparative study with a traditional rule-based controller is conducted to analyze differences in assistance mechanisms of the two controllers.",
