Our findings suggest that, when prompted with American context, ChatGPT exhibits a strong alignment with American culture, but it adapts less effectively to other cultural contexts.

    "translated_abstract": "近期发布的ChatGPT因其在对话中生成类人回应的卓越能力而广受认可。考虑到其被各国用户使用以及其训练了包含多样文化和社会规范的庞大多语料库，评估其文化适应能力至关重要。本文通过分析ChatGPT对旨在量化人类文化差异的问题的回答来调查其潜在的文化背景。我们的研究表明，当以美国背景为提示时，ChatGPT表现出与美国文化的强烈对齐，但其对其他文化背景的适应能力较差。此外，通过使用不同的提示来探测模型，我们发现英文提示会降低模型回答的差异，抹平文化差异并偏向美国文化。本研究对ChatGPT的文化影响提供了有价值的见解，并强调了进一步研究开发更具文化适应性的语言模型的必要性。",
