    "translated_abstract": "重度抑郁障碍(MDD) 是一种多样性疾病，大量的神经生物学基础可能与治疗反应的变异性有关。理解这种变异性的根源并预测结果一直是难以实现的。机器学习已经在预测MDD的治疗反应方面显示出潜力，但其中一项限制是机器学习模型的临床可解释性不足。我们使用差异原型神经网络(DPNN)分析了六个药物治疗抑郁症临床试验的数据(总数n = 5438)。DPNN可以派生出可用于生成患者亚组的病人原型，同时学习生成差异性治疗反应的概率。使用临床和人口统计数据训练了一个模型，用于分类缓解并输出五种一线单药疗法和三种联合治疗的个体缓解概率。模型使用留一研究法交叉验证、置换测试和特征重要性分析进行验证和临床解释性评估。DPNN模型准确预测了所有六个研究的缓解状况，通过鉴定与特定治疗反应更好相关的患者亚组来展示高的临床可解释性。这些研究结果有可能为MDD患者的个性化治疗建议提供信息。",
