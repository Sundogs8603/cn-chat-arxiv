    "translated_abstract": "交织性是一个关键框架，通过调查和实践，它使我们能够检查社会不平等如何通过结构和纪律领域持续存在。在AI公平的理念中，“公平性”是至关重要的，我们认为采用交织性作为分析框架对于有效地实现公平至关重要。通过对AI公平文献中30篇关于交织性的讨论进行批判性回顾，我们归纳和演绎出:1)交织性指导如何在AI公平范例中操作，2)揭示交织性的概念化和实现之间的差距。我们发现，研究人员普遍将交织性缩减为针对人口亚组的公平指标进行优化。他们也未能讨论它们的社会背景，当提到权力时，他们主要将其置于AI流程中。我们将进一步阐述并评估这些差距对于临床研究和实践的影响。",
    "tldr": "本文通过批判性回顾AI公平性文献中30篇交织性讨论，揭示研究人员普遍缺乏对交织性的整体理解，其一方面将其缩小为在群体子组上进行公平度量的优化，另一方面则在社会背景和权力结构的讨论方面存在欠缺。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper conducts a critical review of 30 papers from the AI fairness literature, revealing that researchers generally lack a holistic understanding of intersectionality, reducing it to optimizing fairness metrics over demographic subgroups and failing to discuss its social context and power structures."
