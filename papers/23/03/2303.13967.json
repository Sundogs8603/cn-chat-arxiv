    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种无货币的不可分割对象的动态组合分配模型。我们引入了一个新的解决方案概念，称为“等收入下动态近似竞争均衡”（DACEEI），它规定市场在几乎所有时间段内都必须近似清算。naive的重复应用近似竞争均衡（Budish，2011）并不会产生令人满意的结果，因为市场清算中的近似误差会随着时间的推移快速累积。因此，我们开发了一种新版本的静态近似竞争均衡，使用精心构建的随机预算来确保市场能够精确清算。然后，我们使用它来设计“在线组合分配机制”（OCAM），以高概率实现DACEEI。OCAM具有以下特点(i)对于一个物品具有群组策略证明性 (ii)对于几乎所有代理能实现一物品无嫉妒程度 (iii)几乎所有周期内都有极高的概率近似市场清算。",
