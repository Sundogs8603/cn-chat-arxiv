    "translated_abstract": "心智理论 (ToM) 是指将心理状态归因于他人的能力，是人类认知的基础。目前，对具有认知能力的人工智能（AI）在医疗保健和汽车工业等方面的应用日益广泛。信念、欲望和意图是婴儿早期的能力，也是人类和具有心智理论的机器的认知能力的基础。本文回顾了机器心智理论在信念、欲望和意图方面的最新进展，并介绍了在这三个方面的实验、数据集和方法，总结了近年来不同任务和数据集的发展，并比较了表现良好的模型的优缺点和适用条件，希望这项研究能够指导研究人员快速跟上该领域的最新趋势。与具有特定任务和解决方案框架的其他领域不同，机器心智理论缺乏统一的指导和一系列标准评估任务，这给该领域带来了许多挑战。",
