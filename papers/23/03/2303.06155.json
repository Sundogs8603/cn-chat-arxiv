    "abstract": "In this paper, to deal with the heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) systems, a knowledge distillation (KD) driven training framework for FL is proposed, where each user can select its neural network model on demand and distill knowledge from a big teacher model using its own private dataset. To overcome the challenge of train the big teacher model in resource limited user devices, the digital twin (DT) is exploit in the way that the teacher model can be trained at DT located in the server with enough computing resources. Then, during model distillation, each user can update the parameters of its model at either the physical entity or the digital agent. The joint problem of model selection and training offloading and resource allocation for users is formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem. To solve the problem, Q-learning and optimization are jointly used, where Q-learning selects models for users and determines whether to train locally or on the server, and optimiz",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种知识蒸馏驱动的联邦学习框架，以应对联邦学习系统中的异构性，其中每个用户可以根据需要选择其神经网络模型，并使用自己的私有数据集从大型教师模型中蒸馏知识。为了克服在资源有限的用户设备上训练大型教师模型的挑战，利用数字孪生的方式，教师模型可以在具有足够计算资源的服务器上的数字孪生中进行训练。然后，在模型蒸馏期间，每个用户可以在物理实体或数字代理处更新其模型的参数。为用户选择模型和训练卸载和资源分配制定了混合整数规划（MIP）问题。为了解决这个问题，联合使用Q-learning和优化，其中Q-learning为用户选择模型并确定是在本地还是在服务器上进行训练，而优化则用于资源分配。",
