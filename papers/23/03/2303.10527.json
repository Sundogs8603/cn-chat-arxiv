    "abstract": "It is an established assumption that pattern-based models are good at precision, while learning based models are better at recall. But is that really the case? I argue that there are two kinds of recall: d-recall, reflecting diversity, and e-recall, reflecting exhaustiveness. I demonstrate through experiments that while neural methods are indeed significantly better at d-recall, it is sometimes the case that pattern-based methods are still substantially better at e-recall. Ideal methods should aim for both kinds, and this ideal should in turn be reflected in our evaluations.",

    "translated_abstract": "人们普遍认为，基于模式的模型擅长准确性，而基于学习的模型则更擅长召回率。但这确实是这样吗？作者认为，有两种记忆方式：d-recall，代表多样性，和e-recall，代表详尽性。作者通过实验证明，虽然神经网络方法确实在d-recall方面显著优于模式方法，但有时候模式方法仍然在e-recall方面明显优于神经网络方法。理想的方法应该同时追求这两种方式，并且这种理想应该反映在我们的评估中。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper introduces two kinds of recall (diversity and exhaustiveness) and argues that both pattern-based and neural-based models have their strengths and weaknesses in each kind. The ideal method should aim for both and should be reflected in evaluations."
