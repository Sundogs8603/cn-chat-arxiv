    "translated_abstract": "结合变分蒙特卡罗方法来求解电子薛定谔方程，深度神经网络已成为高精度和强大的波函数ansatz。然而，尽管它们成功且具有优良的可伸缩性，但这些方法仍然在计算上过于昂贵以便广泛采用。一个重要的障碍是需要为每个新系统从头开始优化波函数，因此需要长时间的优化。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的神经网络ansatz，它可以有效地将无关联的、计算廉价的哈特里-福克轨道映射到相关的高精度神经网络轨道。这种ansatz本质上能够学习跨多种化合物和几何结构的单个波函数，这一点我们通过成功将针对小分子片段预训练的波函数模型转移到较大化合物的实验证据得到了证明。此外，我们提供了充分的实验证据来支持这样一个广义波函数的广泛预训练的想法。",
