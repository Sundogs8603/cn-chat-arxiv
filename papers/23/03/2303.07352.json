    "abstract": "Several autonomous driving strategies have been applied to autonomous vehicles, especially in the collision avoidance area. The purpose of collision avoidance is achieved by adjusting the trajectory of autonomous vehicles (AV) to avoid intersection or overlap with the trajectory of surrounding vehicles. A large number of sophisticated vision algorithms have been designed for target inspection, classification, and other tasks, such as ResNet, YOLO, etc., which have achieved excellent performance in vision tasks because of their ability to accurately and quickly capture regional features. However, due to the variability of different tasks, the above models achieve good performance in capturing small regions but are still insufficient in correlating the regional features of the input image with each other. In this paper, we aim to solve this problem and develop an algorithm that takes into account the advantages of CNN in capturing regional features while establishing feature correlation ",
