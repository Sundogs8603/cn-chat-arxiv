    "translated_abstract": "作为情感信号的一种常见形式，非语言语音爆发在日常社交互动中扮演着重要角色。理解和建模人类的语音爆发对于开发强大且广泛应用的人工智能至关重要。探索理解语音爆发的计算方法引起了越来越多的研究关注。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个基于链式回归模型的层次框架，用于从语音爆发中识别情感，明确考虑了多个关系：（i）情感状态和文化之间的关系；（ii）低维（唤醒和价值）与高维（10种情感类别）情感空间之间的关系；以及（iii）高维空间中不同情感类别之间的关系。为了解决数据稀疏性的挑战，我们还使用了自监督学习（SSL）表示与层次和时间聚合模块。所提出的系统参加了ACII情感语音爆发比赛并取得了良好成绩。",
