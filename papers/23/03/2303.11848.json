Latent encodings extracted from positive-labeled data are linearly combined to acquire new samples. These new samples are used as embeddings to increase the density of positive-labeled data and, thus, define a boundary that approximates the positive class. The further a sample is from the boundary the more it is considered as a negative sample. Once a set of negative samples is obtained, the PU learning problem reduces to binary classification. The approach, named Dens-PU due to its reliance on the density of positive-labeled data, was evaluated using benchmark image datasets, and state-of-the-art results were attained.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种新的 PU Learning 方法，基于异常检测策略解决该问题。从正样本数据中提取的潜在编码线性组合以获得新样本。这些新样本被用作嵌入以增加正样本数据的密度，从而定义近似正类的边界。样本距离边界越远，则认为它是负样本的可能性越大。一旦获得一组负样本，PU Learning 问题就转化为二元分类。名为 Dens-PU 的方法，由于其依赖于正样本数据的密度，经过基准图像数据集的评估，取得了最先进的结果。",
