    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种称为内在对称性生成模型的框架，用于在由离散三角形网格近似的二维面上进行生成建模。我们的方法利用离散共形几何的进展，开发了一种从源三角网格到简单流形（例如球体）的目标三角网格的映射。在考虑网格离散化误差后，我们可以将任何为简单流形开发的生成建模方法作为即插即用的子例程使用。我们在多个复杂的流形和多个生成建模子例程上演示了我们的框架，在那里我们展示了我们的方法可以从样本中学习网格上的分布的良好估计，并且也能同时从同一底层流形的多个不同网格中进行学习。",

A map from a source to a target triangle mesh is developed using discrete conformal geometry, and any generative modeling approach can be used for training. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on multiple manifolds and generative modeling subroutines."
