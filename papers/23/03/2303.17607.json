    "translated_abstract": "微观粒子遵循量子力学的原理——那么宏观和微观世界之间的明确界限在哪里呢？正是这个“解释问题”促使薛定谔提出了他著名的思想实验（一只同时死亡和活着的猫），引发了关于量子测量问题的激烈争论，但至今仍没有令人满意的答案。这正是描述自然定律的严格数学模型的不足之处。我们提出了一个基于达尔文自然选择的计算模型来描述和理解自然定律。实际上，无论是宏观粒子、微观电子还是安全问题，它们都可以被认为是一个实体，这个实体随着时间的推移变化，可以用状态和值组成的数据序列来描述。观察者可以从这个数据序列中学习，构建理论（通常由函数和微分方程组成）。我们不再使用用户的经验或逻辑来建模，而是使用数据。计算模型的核心基于两个过程：函数选择和运算符选择。函数选择过程类似于达尔文的进化，允许具有优势特征的函数生存和繁殖；而运算符选择过程捕捉了自然定律的相互依存性，可以平衡自然界中不同函数的优势。该方法使我们能够从数据中自动发现和表示自然定律，并已成功应用于模拟量子力学、经典力学和系统生物学。",
