    "translated_abstract": "大多数中文字素到音素（G2P）系统采用三阶段架构，首先将输入序列转化为字符嵌入，使用语言模型获取语言信息，然后基于整个输入序列的全局上下文预测音素。然而，仅凭语言知识往往是不充分的。语言模型经常编码句子的过于普遍的结构，并未涵盖使用语音知识所需的特定情况。此外，需要一个手工后处理系统来解决与字符音调相关的问题。然而，系统在词边界分割上存在不一致性，从而降低了G2P系统的性能。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了Reinforcer模型，通过强调邻近字符之间的语音信息来为语言模型提供强大的引导偏差，以帮助消除发音的歧义。实验结果表明，与先前的中文G2P系统相比，Reinforcer模型在各种指标上实现了最先进的性能。",
