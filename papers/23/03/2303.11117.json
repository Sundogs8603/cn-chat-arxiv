At the feature extraction level, our designed Identity Masked Multi-head Attention (IM-MHA) captures the identity-based long-distant context in the dialogue to contain the diverse influence of different participants and construct the global emotional atmosphere, while the devised Dialogue-based Gate Recurrent Unit (DialogGRU) that aggregates the emotional tendencies of dyadic dialogue is applied to",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，随着人机界面技术的进步和实施，对话中的情感识别（ERC）吸引了越来越多的关注。然而，以往的建模方法在全局和局部上下文依赖方面丢失了依赖信息的多样性，并且在分类级别不考虑上下文依赖关系。本文提出了一种新的依赖性建模方法，由情感惯性和感染驱动（EmotionIC），用于在特征提取和分类级别上进行会话情感识别。在特征提取级别，我们设计的身份掩码多头注意（IM-MHA）捕捉对话中基于身份的长距离上下文，以包含不同参与者的不同影响构建全局情感氛围，而设计的基于对话门控循环单元(DialogGRU)则聚合了二元对话的情感倾向，并应用于分类过程。",

    "en_tdlr": "This article proposes a novel approach, EmotionIC, for conversational emotion recognition, which is driven by emotional inertia and contagion, and takes into account the context dependency at both feature extraction and classification levels. Multiple specific methods are designed to capture contextual information, such as Identity Masked Multi-head Attention (IM-MHA) and Dialogue-based Gate Recurrent Unit (DialogGRU), to improve the model performance."
