    "translated_abstract": "GPT系列模型，如GPT-3、CodeX、InstructGPT、ChatGPT等，由于其出色的自然语言处理能力而受到广泛关注。然而，尽管已有大量研究探讨了GPT系列模型与精调模型在能力上的差异，但对于GPT系列模型的能力随时间演化的研究却受到了限制。为了全面分析GPT系列模型的能力，我们选择了六个代表性模型，包括两个GPT-3系列模型（即davinci和text-davinci-001）和四个GPT-3.5系列模型（即code-davinci-002、text-davinci-002、text-davinci-003和gpt-3.5-turbo）。我们使用21个数据集在九个自然语言理解（NLU）任务上评估它们的表现。特别地，我们比较了每个任务中不同模型在零样本和少样本场景下的性能和鲁棒性。我们广泛的实验表明，GPT系列模型的整体能力继续随时间演化，最新的模型在大多数任务中的表现优于前一代，特别是在零样本情况下。",
