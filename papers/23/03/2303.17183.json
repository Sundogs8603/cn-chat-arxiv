In order to facilitate the development of the LLMS in the Nordic languages, we curate a high-quality dataset consisting of 1.2TB of text, in all of the major North Germanic languages (Danish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish), as well as some high-quality English data.

    "translated_abstract": "预训练大型语言模型( LLMs )需要海量的文本数据，LLMs的性能通常与数据集的规模和质量相关。这意味着在北欧等语种中建立LLMs可能是具有挑战性的，因为其文本语料库的可用性有限。为了促进北欧语言的LLMs开发，我们策划了一个高质量的数据集，其中包括了1.2TB的文本，涵盖了所有重要的北日耳曼语言（丹麦语、冰岛语、挪威语和瑞典语），以及一些高质量的英文数据。本文详细介绍了我们收集、清理和过滤该数据集的考虑和流程。",
