    "abstract": "Interest in autonomous driving (AD) and intelligent vehicles (IVs) is growing at a rapid pace due to the convenience, safety, and economic benefits. Although a number of surveys have reviewed research achievements in this field, they are still limited in specific tasks, lack of systematic summary and research directions in the future. Here we propose a Survey of Surveys (SoS) for total technologies of AD and IVs that reviews the history, summarizes the milestones, and provides the perspectives, ethics, and future research directions. To our knowledge, this article is the first SoS with milestones in AD and IVs, which constitutes our complete research work together with two other technical surveys. We anticipate that this article will bring novel and diverse insights to researchers and abecedarians, and serve as a bridge between past and future.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于方便、安全和经济效益的原因，对自动驾驶（AD）和智能汽车（IV）的兴趣正在迅速增长。虽然一些调查已经回顾了该领域的研究成果，但它们仍然局限于特定任务，缺乏系统性的总结和未来的研究方向。在这里，我们提出了一份对AD和IV的总技术的调查综述（SoS），回顾了历史，总结了里程碑，并提供了展望、伦理和未来的研究方向。据我们所知，本文是第一篇关于AD和IV里程碑的SoS，与其他两篇技术调查一起构成了我们的完整研究工作。我们预计这篇文章将为研究人员和初学者带来新颖而多样的见解，并作为过去和未来之间的桥梁。",
