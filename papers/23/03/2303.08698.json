    "translated_abstract": "零样本学习存在领域转移问题，即未见类别的真实和学习数据分布不匹配。尽管转导式零样本学习可以使用未见类别的无标签样本，但分布偏移仍然很高。本文提出了一种新颖的 TZSL 模型（命名为 Bi-VAEGAN），通过加强视觉空间和辅助空间之间的分布对齐，大大改善了这种偏移。模型设计的关键提议包括（1）双向分布对齐，（2）基于 L_2 范数的简单而有效的特征归一化方法，（3）更复杂的未见类别先验估计方法。在使用四个数据集进行基准评估时，Bi-VAEGAN 在标准和广义 TZSL 设置下均取得了新的最先进结果。代码可在 https://github.com/Zhicaiwww/Bi-VAEGAN 找到。",
