    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个单阶段框架TriDet，用于时间行为检测。目前的方法往往由于视频中模糊的动作边界而导致不准确的边界预测。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新颖的三叉头（Trident-head）来通过相对概率分布来建模动作边界。在TriDet的特征金字塔中，我们提出了一个高效的可扩展粒度感知（SGP）层来缓解自注意力在视频特征中发生的排名损失问题，并在不同的时间粒度上聚合信息。由于三叉头和基于SGP的特征金字塔的优势，TriDet在三个具有挑战性的基准测试（THUMOS14、HACS和EPIC-KITCHEN 100）上实现了最先进的性能，与以前的方法相比计算成本更低。例如，在THUMOS14上，TriDet的平均mAP达到$69.3\\%$，超过先前最优结果$2.5\\%$，但只有$74.6\\%$的计算成本。",
