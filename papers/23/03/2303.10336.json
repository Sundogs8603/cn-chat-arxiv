    "translated_abstract": "触控纺织品的发展带来了许多新颖的交互技术和应用。我们的数字编织电容式活动传感器可以在很少的人工干预下大规模制造。它们的敏感区域由单个导电纱线创建，并且只需要与外部硬件进行少量连接。这种技术提高了它们的鲁棒性和可用性，同时将实现交互性的复杂性从硬件转移到了计算模型。本文通过创建一个交互式手势识别系统的基础，提高了这种传感器的功能。它使用了一种新颖的传感器设计和基于神经网络的识别模型，可以对12种相对复杂、单触点手势类进行89.8%的准确分类，展示了未来令人兴奋的应用可能性。我们还通过其佩戴时的性能和洗涤的影响展示了该系统在实际环境中的适用性和鲁棒性。",
