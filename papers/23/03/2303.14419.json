The user rating data on such platforms are foods for recommender system algorithms. Understanding the evolution pattern and its underlying mechanism is the key to understand the structures of input data for recommender systems. Prior research on input data analysis for recommender systems is quite limited, with a notable exception in 2018 [6]. In this paper, we take advantage of Poisson Process to analyze the evolution mechanism of the input data structures. We discover that homogeneous Poisson Process could not capture the mechanism of user rating behavior on online rating platforms, and inhomogeneous Poisson Process is compatible with the formation process.",

    "translated_abstract": "在线评分平台代表了在线文化和商业商品消费的新趋势。此类平台上的用户评分数据是推荐算法的重要依据。了解数据演化模式及其潜在机制是理解推荐系统输入数据结构的关键。以往推荐系统输入数据分析的研究相当有限，唯一的例外是2018年的一项研究。本文利用泊松过程分析输入数据结构的演化机制。我们发现均匀泊松过程无法捕捉用户在在线评分平台上的评价行为机制，而非均匀泊松过程与形成过程是兼容的。",
