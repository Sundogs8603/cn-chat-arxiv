    "translated_abstract": "在自动驾驶中，数据增强常用于改进三维物体检测。最基本的方法包括插入复制对象和旋转和缩放整个训练帧。也已经开发了许多变体。然而，现有方法与现实世界的可能性相比相当有限。在这项工作中，我们开发了一种多样化和逼真增强方法，可以灵活地构造整体对象，自由地定位和旋转对象，并相应地应用自遮挡和外遮挡。为了提高整体对象构造的多样性，我们开发了一种迭代方法，将从现实世界观察到的多个对象随机组合成单个对象。与现有增强方法不同的是，构造的对象可以随机放置和旋转在训练帧中，因为适当的遮挡可以反映在最终整体对象中。最后，为了防止过度增强导致过拟合，我们介绍了一种分层遮挡概率设置，通过对象的位置和大小调整遮挡强度。",

The method introduces an iterative approach for constructing a diverse object from multiple real-world objects, and allows randomized object placement and rotation. A hierarchical occlusion probability setting is also introduced to prevent overfitting caused by over-augmentation."
