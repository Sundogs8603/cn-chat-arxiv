    "translated_abstract": "基于蛋白质序列的因果语言建模，蛋白质语言模型(PLMs)已成为一种有前途的蛋白质序列设计工具。但是在实际的蛋白质工程中，有许多情况是在保持其它残基的情况下优化蛋白质中间的氨基酸。由于PLMs的从左到右的性质，现有的PLMs通过促使前缀残基来修改后缀残基，这对于考虑整个周围背景的填充任务是不足够的。为了找到更有效的PLMs用于蛋白质工程，我们设计了一个新的基准测试——二级结构中间填充——SEIFER，它近似于填充序列设计场景。通过对现有模型在基准测试中的评估，我们揭示了现有语言模型的弱点，证明了通过填充中间变换训练的语言模型(称为ProtFIM)，更适合于蛋白质工程。此外，我们证明了ProtFIM生成的蛋白质序列的中间部分，具有更准确的结构特征。",
