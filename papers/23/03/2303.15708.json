    "abstract": "There is a broad consensus that news media outlets incorporate ideological biases in their news articles. However, prior studies on measuring the discrepancies among media outlets and further dissecting the origins of semantic differences suffer from small sample sizes and limited scope. In this study, we collect a large dataset of 1.8 million news headlines from major U.S. media outlets spanning from 2014 to 2022 to thoroughly track and dissect the semantic discrepancy in U.S. news media. We employ multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to quantify the semantic discrepancy relating to four prominent topics - domestic politics, economic issues, social issues, and foreign affairs. Additionally, we compare the most frequent n-grams in media headlines to provide further qualitative insights into our analysis. Our findings indicate that on domestic politics and social issues, the discrepancy can be attributed to a certain degree of media bias. Meanwhile, the discrepancy in reporting foreig",

    "translated_abstract": "普遍一致认为新闻媒体在其新闻文章中采用意识形态偏见。然而，在测量媒体机构之间的差异并进一步解剖语义差异的源头方面，先前的研究受到了样本大小的限制和范围的限制。在本研究中，我们收集了180万份美国主要媒体机构从2014年至2022年的新闻标题的大型数据集，以全面跟踪和解剖美国新闻媒体中的语义差异。我们采用多元对应分析(MCA)来量化与四个突出主题相关的语义差异 - 国内政治、经济问题、社会问题和外交事务。此外，我们比较媒体标题中最常见的n-gram，提供进一步的定性分析。我们的研究结果表明，在国内政治和社会问题上，差异可以在一定程度上归因于媒体偏见。与此同时，外交报道中的差异则更多地反映了多样性。",
