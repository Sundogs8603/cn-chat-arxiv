    "translated_abstract": "在许多检测应用中，机载雷达的数据传输速率远高于无线数据传输速率，因此通常使用机载数据存储系统来存储雷达数据。具有良好抗震性能的数据存储系统通常使用NAND Flash作为存储介质，但存在长时间的文件管理问题，严重影响数据存储速度，特别是在平台小型化的限制下。为了解决这个问题，提出了一种基于机器学习的小型机载雷达数据存储方法。基于机器学习建立了存储训练模型，能够处理各种雷达数据，采用该模型对文件管理方法进行分类确定，然后应用于雷达数据的存储。为验证所提出方法的性能，对小型机载雷达的数据存储系统进行了测试。实验结果表明，基于机器学习的方法可显著降低文件管理时间，有效提高小型机载雷达数据存储系统的数据存储速度。",
