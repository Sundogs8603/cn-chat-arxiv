    "translated_abstract": "多层神经网络的梯度下降学习具有多个引人注意的特点。尤其是，在大批量数据平均后，经验风险的下降速率是非单调的。几乎没有进展的长周期和快速下降的间隔交替出现。这些连续的学习阶段往往在非常不同的时间尺度上进行。最后，在早期阶段学习的模型通常是“简单的”或“易于学习的”，尽管以难以形式化的方式。本文研究了分布符合单指数模型的高维宽两层神经网络的梯度流动力学，在一系列新的严密结果、非严密数学推导和数值实验的基础上，提供了对网络学习动态的全面分析。我们特别指出，我们通过学习率参数化清晰的阶段转换，并展示了它们与长周期的出现和消失有关。我们还为早期学习时所学模型的简单性提供了理论解释，并证明它们可以用于规范训练过程。",

Clear phase transitions parameterized by the learning rate are identified in high-dimensional two-layer neural networks with data distributed according to a single-index model. The simplicity of models learned in the early phase is explained theoretically."
