    "translated_abstract": "人脸识别作为一种流行的生物识别解决方案，在许多应用中都有广泛的应用。作为一个重要的替代方案，物理对抗攻击可以识别人脸识别系统的弱点，并在部署之前评估其鲁棒性。然而，大部分现有的物理攻击方法要么很容易被检测出来，要么对商业识别系统无效。本文的目标是开发一种更可靠的技术，可以对商业系统进行端到端的对抗性鲁棒性评估。要求该技术能够同时欺骗黑盒识别模型并逃避防御机制。为了实现这一目标，我们设计了具有精心拓扑结构的对抗性纹理3D网格（AT3D），可在人脸上3D打印并粘贴以逃避防御。然而，基于网格的优化方案需要在高维网格空间中计算梯度，并可能陷入不可接受的局部最优解。",
