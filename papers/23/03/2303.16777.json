    "abstract": "COVID-19 misinformation on social media platforms such as twitter is a threat to effective pandemic management. Prior works on tweet COVID-19 misinformation negates the role of semantic features common to twitter such as charged emotions. Thus, we present a novel COVID-19 misinformation model, which uses both a tweet emotion encoder and COVID-19 misinformation encoder to predict whether a tweet contains COVID-19 misinformation. Our emotion encoder was fine-tuned on a novel annotated dataset and our COVID-19 misinformation encoder was fine-tuned on a subset of the COVID-HeRA dataset. Experimental results show superior results using the combination of emotion and misinformation encoders as opposed to a misinformation classifier alone. Furthermore, extensive result analysis was conducted, highlighting low quality labels and mismatched label distributions as key limitations to our study.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体平台如Twitter上的COVID-19错误信息对有效的疫情管理构成威胁。先前在推特上的COVID-19错误信息的工作否认了推特上普遍存在的诸如带电情感的语义特征的作用。因此，我们提出了一种新的COVID-19错误信息模型，该模型使用推特情感编码器和COVID-19错误信息编码器来预测推文是否包含COVID-19错误信息。我们的情感编码器在一组新的注释数据集上进行了微调，我们的COVID-19错误信息编码器在COVID-HeRA数据集的子集上进行了微调。实验结果表明，使用情感和错误信息编码器的组合比单独的错误信息分类器产生了更好的结果。此外，进行了广泛的结果分析，强调了低质量标签和不匹配的标签分布是我们研究的主要限制因素。",
