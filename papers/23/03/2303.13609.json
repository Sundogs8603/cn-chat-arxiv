    "translated_abstract": "联合雷达通信（JRC）已经成为一种有效利用有限电磁频谱的有前途的技术。在JRC应用中，如安全军用接收器中，雷达和通信信号经常叠加在接收信号中。在这些被动监听哨所中，雷达和通信的信号和通道对于接收器来说都是未知的。从叠加信号中恢复所有信号和通道参数的不适定问题被称为双盲反卷积（DBD）。在这项工作中，我们调查了更具挑战性的多天线接收器版本的DBD。我们用少数（稀疏）连续值参数，如时延、多普勒速度和到达方向（DoAs）来建模雷达和通信通道。为了解决这个高度不适定的DBD问题，我们建议最小化依赖于未知参数的多元原子范数（SoMAN）之和。为此，我们使用半定规划设计了一个精确的解。",
