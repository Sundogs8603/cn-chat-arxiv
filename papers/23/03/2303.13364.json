    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the EmoWoz dataset, an extension of MultiWOZ that provides emotion labels for the dialogues. MultiWOZ was partitioned initially for another purpose, resulting in a distributional shift when considering the new purpose of emotion recognition. The emotion tags in EmoWoz are highly imbalanced and unevenly distributed across the partitions, which causes sub-optimal performance and poor comparison of models. We propose a stratified sampling scheme based on emotion tags to address this issue, improve the dataset's distribution, and reduce dataset shift. We also introduce a special technique to handle conversation (sequential) data with many emotional tags. Using our proposed sampling method, models built upon EmoWoz can perform better, making it a more reliable resource for training conversational agents with emotional intelligence. We recommend that future researchers use this new partitioning to ensure consistent and accurate performance evaluations.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文聚焦于EmoWOZ数据集，该数据集是MultiWOZ数据集的扩展，提供了对话的情感标签。与原始的MultiWOZ数据集因其它目的被划分不同，EmoWOZ中情感标签高度不平衡，分布在不同划分中也不均匀，导致模型比较效果欠佳。为了解决这个问题、改善数据集的分布并减少数据集分布偏差，我们提出了一种基于情感标签的分层抽样方法，并引入了一种特殊技术来处理有多个情感标签的对话（序列）数据。使用我们提出的抽样方法，建立在EmoWoz上的模型可以表现更好，使它成为训练具有情感智能的对话代理更为可靠的资源。我们推荐未来的研究者使用这个新的数据集划分来确保一致和准确的性能评估。",
