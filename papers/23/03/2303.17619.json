    "translated_abstract": "注意力（和分心）识别是改善人机协作的关键因素。我们介绍了一个组装场景，在其中，人类操作员和协作机器人平等地合作拼装变速箱。该设置提供了多种机会，使机器人能够根据操作员的注意力而适应其行为，从而可以提高协作体验并减少心理压力。作为第一步，我们识别人类操作员关注的工作区域，并因此检测出操作员注意力分散的情况。我们提出了一种新颖的深度学习方法来开发注意力识别模型。首先，我们使用公开的图像数据集训练卷积神经网络来估计注视方向。然后，我们使用少量数据集的迁移学习将凝视方向映射到预定义的感兴趣区域。在我们实验室收集的小数据集上进行交叉验证时，使用这种方法训练的模型表现非常好。我们的实验表明，所提出的注意力识别模型可以用于通过使机器人根据操作者的注意力调整其行为来改善人机协作。",
