    "translated_abstract": "深度学习近年来得到了迅速发展，并在广泛应用中取得了最先进的性能。但是，训练模型通常需要收集大量标记数据，这需要昂贵耗时。特别是在医学图像分析（MIA）领域，数据有限，标签很难获得。因此，人们开发了高效标记深度学习方法，充分利用标记数据以及非标记和弱标记数据的丰富性。在本调查中，我们对近300篇论文进行了广泛调查，以全面概述最新进展的高效标记学习策略在MIA中的研究现状。我们首先介绍高效标记学习的背景，并将不同方案的方法归类。接下来，我们通过每种方案详细研究了目前最先进的方法。具体而言，我们进行了深入调查，覆盖了不仅是标准策略，还包括使用后处理和集合方法等方法。",
