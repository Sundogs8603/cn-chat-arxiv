    "translated_abstract": "运动障碍患者的健康监测非常重要，因为他们的活动能力有限，慢性病的持续时间很长。目前，利用可穿戴传感器收集运动障碍患者的数据并进行基于机器学习的处理是一种有效的健康监测方法。然而，可穿戴传感器系统难以获得高质量和大量数据，无法满足诊断精度的要求。此外，现有的机器学习方法不能很好地处理这个问题。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了基于Diamond Stacked稀疏自编码器集成模型（DsaeEM）的运动障碍患者健康监测算法。该算法有两个主要组成部分。首先，使用特征嵌入堆叠稀疏自编码器（FSSAE）设计特征扩展。其次，设计了一种特征还原机制，使用Diamond层结构去除冗余和非信息特征。该模型在可穿戴传感器获得的真实数据上进行评估，相比现有的机器学习方法，显示出显著的诊断精度提高。",
