    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了对抗合成攻击（包括拒绝服务攻击、虚假数据注入攻击、伪装攻击和执行攻击）的异构多智能体系统的分布式弹性输出约束控制。受数字孪生的启发，使用具有更高安全性和隐私性的孪生层（TL）将上述问题分解为两个任务：对TL上的DoS攻击的防御协议和对赛博物理层（CPL）上的执行攻击的防御协议。首先，考虑到领导动态的建模误差，我们引入分布式观察器，在TL上重新构造每个跟随者的领导动态。其次，使用分布式估计器根据在TL上重建的领导动态估计跟随者状态。第三，根据重建的领导动态，我们设计分散算法器在CPL上计算输出调节器方程。第四，提出分布式自适应抗攻击弹性控制方案，保证跟随者的输出被抗FDI和伪装攻击所约束。最后，提供了数值仿真，证明了所提出的弹性输出约束控制策略的有效性和优越性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a resilient output containment control strategy for heterogeneous multiagent systems against composite attacks, based on the digital twin approach. It includes defense protocols against DoS attacks on the twin layer and against actuation attacks on the cyber-physical layer, and features distributed observers, estimators and adaptive attack-resilient controlled laws to ensure the containment of follower outputs against FDI and camouflage attacks."
