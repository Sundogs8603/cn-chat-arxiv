    "translated_abstract": "神经网络已成为现代软件系统中不可或缺的一部分。然而，他们仍然存在许多问题，特别是对对抗攻击的脆弱性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新的神经网络验证程序推理框架，称为符号推理。我们框架的关键组成部分是符号域和二次关系的使用。符号域具有非常灵活的语义，而二次关系则非常表达能力强。它们允许我们将许多神经网络验证问题编码为二次程序。然后，我们的方案将二次程序松弛为半定程序，可以高效地解决。这个框架让我们能够在不同的场景下验证各种神经网络属性，特别是那些对非符号域具有挑战性的属性。此外，它还引入了新的表示和验证任务的观点。我们相信，我们的框架可以为神经网络验证带来重要的改进，特别是解决它们对对抗攻击的脆弱性。",
