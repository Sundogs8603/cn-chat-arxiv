    "translated_abstract": "零样本学习旨在通过泛化从已知类别学习到的视觉特征和语义属性的关系来识别未知类别。最近的一种称为转导式零样本学习的范式，更进一步利用在训练过程中不标记的未知数据，并取得了令人印象深刻的结果。然而，这些方法总是通过生成对抗网络从属性中合成未知特征，以减少对已知类别的偏差。但是，它们忽视了未标记的未知数据中的语义信息，因此无法生成高保真的属性一致的未知特征。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的转导式零样本学习方法，该方法生成未知数据的语义属性，并将它们导入到生成过程中。具体来说，我们首先训练一个语义属性解码器，该解码器学习从视觉特征到语义属性的映射。然后，从属性解码器中，我们获得未标记的数据的伪属性，并将它们集成到生成的过程中。",
