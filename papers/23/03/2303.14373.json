    "translated_abstract": "在细胞学图像中，细胞实例分割对于生物学分析和癌症筛查具有重要意义，但由于大量重叠的半透明细胞簇导致边界不清晰，以及将类似物和碎片混淆为细胞核，因此仍然具有挑战性。本文提出了一种去重叠网络（DoNet），采用分解和重新组合策略。双路径区域分割模块（DRM）明确将细胞群分解为交集区域和补集区域，随后是一个语义一致性引导的重新组合模块（CRM）进行集成。为进一步引入胞质中细胞核的包含关系，我们设计了一个掩模引导的区域建议策略（MRP），将细胞注意力图集成到内部细胞实例预测中。我们在ISBI2014和CPS数据集上验证了所提出的方法。实验结果表明，我们提出的DoNet显着优于其他最先进的细胞实例分割方法。",
