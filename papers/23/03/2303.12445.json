    "translated_abstract": "肾移植已成为终末期肾脏疾病的最有效解决方案。由于复杂原因，移植慢性功能障碍的重大风险仍然存在，可能导致移植失败。医学影像在肾移植监测中发挥着重要作用。然而，移植监督具有多学科特点，尤其是结合了肾脏学、泌尿学和放射学，在这种高维度和复杂数据中识别强大的生物标志物用于预后是具有挑战性的。本文受到大型语言模型（LLMs）的最近成功启发，提出了MEDIMP——医学影像和提示——一种用于多模式学习肾移植动态对比增强磁共振成像（DCE MRI）有意义的表示模型，通过将结构性临床生物数据翻译成文本提示来完成。MEDIMP基于联合文本-图像嵌入的对比学习，以执行这项具有挑战性的任务。",
