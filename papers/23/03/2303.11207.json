Here, we employ 2D RNNs to investigate two prototypical quantum many-body Hamiltonians exhibiting topological order. Specifically, we demonstrate that RNN wave functions can effectively capture the topological order of the toric code and a Bose-Hubbard spin liquid on the kagome lattice by estimating their topological entanglement entropies. We also find that RNNs favor coherent superpositions of minimally-entangled states over minimally-entangled states themselves.

    "translated_abstract": "循环神经网络被用于自然语言处理，但它在描述强关联量子多体系统方面也很有前途。本研究利用二维循环神经网络研究了两个典型展现拓扑序的多体哈密顿量。具体来说，我们证明了循环神经网络波函数可以通过估算其拓扑纠缠熵，有效地捕获扭曲编码和蜂巢格上 Bose-Hubbard 自旋液体的拓扑序。我们还发现，循环神经网络更倾向于利用很少纠缠状态的相干叠加。总的来说，我们的研究表明，循环神经网络波函数是研究不对称破缺之外物态相的强有力工具。",
