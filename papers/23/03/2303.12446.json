    "abstract": "The chore division problem simulates the fair division of a heterogeneous undesirable resource among several agents. In the fair division problem, each agent only gains value from its own piece. Agents may, however, also be concerned with the pieces given to other agents; these externalities naturally appear in fair division situations. Branzei et ai. (Branzei et al., IJCAI 2013) generalize the classical ideas of proportionality and envy-freeness while extending the classical model to account for externalities.",
