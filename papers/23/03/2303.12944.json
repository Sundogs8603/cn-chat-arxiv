    "translated_abstract": "近年来，现有和新的网络攻击的大量出现对金融服务的稳定性构成了根本性的威胁。很难预测能够引发严重金融危机的攻击的性质。金融服务的前所未有的数字化转型在 COVID-19 疫情期间得到加速，并仍在持续进行中。攻击者正在利用这一转型，对金融稳定性和完整性构成新的全球威胁。许多大型机构正在从中心化金融（CeFi）转向去中心化金融（DeFi），因为去中心化金融具有许多优势。区块链可以对金融业的可信度、安全性、可访问性、成本效益和开放性带来重大和深远的影响。本文着重探讨了区块链和联邦学习如何在金融服务中使用。它从最近的两个应用案例的概述开始，解释了联邦学习和区块链技术如何提高金融服务的安全性和隐私性。此外，它还阐述了在实施这些技术时面临的挑战并提供了潜在解决方案。",
