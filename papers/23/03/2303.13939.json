    "translated_abstract": "听取视频会议和在线课程的长时间音频记录以获取信息极为低效。即使自动语音识别系统将记录转录为长形式的口语语言文档，仅阅读语音识别转录也只能在一定程度上加快寻找信息的速度。研究表明，关键词提取、主题分割和摘要等一系列自然语言处理应用显著提高用户获得重要信息的效率。会议场景是应用这些口语语言处理能力最有价值的场景之一。然而，缺乏大规模公开的会议数据集对这些自然语言处理任务的进展产生了严重阻碍。为了促进自然语言处理技术的发展，我们建立了一个大规模的通用会议理解和生成基准(MUG)，以评估一系列自然语言处理任务的性能，包括主题分割、话题级别和会话级别的摘要提取等。",
