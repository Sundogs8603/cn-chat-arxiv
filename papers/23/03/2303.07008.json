    "abstract": "This paper adapts ideas from social identity theory to set out a new framework for modelling conspicuous consumption. Notably, this approach can explain two stylised facts about conspicuous consumption that initially seem at odds with one another, and to date have required different families of models to explain each: (1) people consume more visible goods when their neighbours' incomes rise, but (2) consume less visible goods when incomes of those with the same race in a wider geographic area rise. The first fact is typically explained by `Keeping up with the Joneses' models, and the second by signalling models. Our model also explains related features of conspicuous consumption: that the rich are more sensitive to others' incomes than the poor, and that the effect of income inequality on consumption differs qualitatively across groups. Importantly, it explains this fourth stylised fact without falling back on differences in preferences across groups, as required in other models. In ad",

    "translated_abstract": "本文将社会认同理论的思想应用于建立一种新的显眼消费模型。值得注意的是，这种方法可以解释关于显眼消费的两个特征，这些特征最初似乎相互矛盾，并且迄今为止需要不同的模型来解释每个特征：（1）当邻居的收入上升时，人们会消费更多的可见商品，但是（2）当更广泛地理区域内具有相同种族的人的收入上升时，会消费更少的可见商品。第一个特征通常由“跟上琼斯”的模型来解释，第二个特征则由信号模型来解释。我们的模型还解释了显眼消费的相关特征：富人对他人收入的敏感程度比穷人更高，而收入不平等对消费的影响在不同群体之间存在质的差异。重要的是，它解释了这第四个特征，而不需要像其他模型那样依赖于群体间偏好的差异。",
