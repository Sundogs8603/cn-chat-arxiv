    "translated_abstract": "功能性电刺激（FES）已经越来越多地与其他康复设备（包括机器人）集成在一起。 FES循环是康复治疗中常用的FES应用之一，它通过刺激腿部肌肉以特定模式进行。 适当的模式因人而异，需要手动调整，这可能需要耗费时间并对个体用户具有挑战性。 本文提出了一种基于人工智能的方法，可用于寻找循环刺激模式，而无需额外的硬件或传感器。我们的方法包括两个阶段，首先使用强化学习和详细的肌肉骨骼模型找到基于模型的模式，使用开源软件构建模型，可以通过我们的自动脚本进行定制，并且可以由非技术人员使用而不需要额外费用。接下来，我们的方法使用真实的自行车数据对模式进行微调。 我们在静止三轮车上对我们的方法进行了模拟测试和实验测试。在模拟测试中，我们的方法可以...",
