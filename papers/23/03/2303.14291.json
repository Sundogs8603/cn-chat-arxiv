    "translated_abstract": "在许多观测和实验科学领域，数据非常稀缺。在高能天体物理学中，受到天体遮挡和有限的望远镜时间的影响，数据观测受到干扰。而在合成化学和材料科学的实验室实验中得出的数据，耗时和成本都非常高昂。然而，在科学领域中通常可以获得有关数据产生机制的知识，例如实验装置的测量误差等。这两个特征，即数据量小和对基本物理原理的了解，使得高斯过程（GPs）成为适合拟合此类数据集的理想候选。GPs 能够考虑到不确定性，例如在分子和材料的虚拟筛选中进行预测，并且还可以对不完整的数据进行推断，例如从黑洞吸积盘的潜在发射特征。此外，GPs目前是贝叶斯优化的工作模型，这是一种预计将成为引导学习的方法。",
