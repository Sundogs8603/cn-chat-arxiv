    "translated_abstract": "在乘用车领域，电池电动车(BEV)已成为去碳化交通的最有前途的选择。对于重型车辆(HDV)，技术领域似乎更为开放。除了BEV外，还讨论了用于动态供电的电动公路系统(ERS)，以及使用氢燃料电池或电力燃料的卡车间接电气化。在这里，我们研究了这些替代方案的电力部门影响。我们将基于未来德国高可再生能源份额的情景，应用一个开源的容量扩展模型，利用详细的以路线为基础的卡车交通数据。结果表明，可灵活充电的车辆共享BEV的电力部门成本最低，而使用电力燃料的重型车辆的成本最高。如果BEV和ERS-BEV没有以优化的方式充电，电力部门成本会增加，但仍远低于使用氢或电力燃料的情景。这是相对较小电池、高度灵活的BEV在短途和中途步骤转移和超出道路广泛使用的优势的结果。",
