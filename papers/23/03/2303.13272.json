    "translated_abstract": "演奏技巧（IPT）是音乐表演的关键元素。然而，大多数现有的IPT检测方法仅涉及单声道音乐信号，对于具有重叠IPT或混合IPT的多声部独奏音乐中的IPT检测几乎没有研究。在本文中，我们将其建模为帧级多标签分类问题，并将其应用于古筝，一种中国弹拨弦乐器。我们创建了一个新的数据集，古筝_Tech99，其中包含古筝录音以及每个音符的起始、结束、音高和IPT注释。因为不同的IPT在其长度方面有很大变化，我们提出了一种使用多尺度网络和自注意方法解决这个问题的新方法。多尺度网络从不同的尺度提取特征，而在最粗糙的尺度上应用于特征映射的自注意机制进一步增强了长程特征提取。我们的方法在IPT检测方面比现有的方法表现更好，表明了其在多声部独奏音乐的IPT检测中的有效性。",
