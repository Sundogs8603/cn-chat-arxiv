    "translated_abstract": "基于知识的视觉问答需要超出图像范围的外部知识来回答问题。早期的研究从显式知识库（KBs）检索所需的知识，这经常会引入与问题无关的信息，从而限制了模型的性能。最近的研究试图将大型语言模型（即GPT-3）作为隐含式知识引擎来获取回答所需的必要知识。尽管这些方法取得了令人鼓舞的结果，但我们认为它们还没有充分发挥GPT-3的能力，因为提供的输入信息仍然不足。在本文中，我们提出了Prophet——一个概念上简单的框架，旨在通过回答启发式方式，促使GPT-3解决基于知识的VQA问题。具体来说，我们首先在特定的基于知识的VQA数据集上训练一个纯VQA模型，而不使用外部知识。之后，我们从模型中提取了两种互补的答案启发式：答案候选项。",
