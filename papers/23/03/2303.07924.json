    "abstract": "Thanks to the rise of self-supervised learning, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems now achieve near-human performance on a wide variety of datasets. However, they still lack generalization capability and are not robust to domain shifts like accent variations. In this work, we use speech audio representing four different French accents to create fine-tuning datasets that improve the robustness of pre-trained ASR models. By incorporating various accents in the training set, we obtain both in-domain and out-of-domain improvements. Our numerical experiments show that we can reduce error rates by up to 25% (relative) on African and Belgian accents compared to single-domain training while keeping a good performance on standard French.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着自监督学习的增长，自动语音识别系统在广泛数据集上已经实现了接近人类的性能。然而，它们仍然缺乏泛化能力，并且不具备对口音变化等领域转移的稳健性。在本文中，我们使用代表四种不同法语口音的语音音频来创建微调数据集，以提高预训练ASR模型的稳健性。通过在训练集中包含不同的口音，我们得到了领域内和领域外的改进。数字实验表明，在与单领域训练相比，我们可以将错误率在非洲和比利时口音上降低高达25%（相对值），同时在标准法语上保持良好的性能。",
