    "abstract": "Recently, social media platforms are heavily moderated to prevent the spread of online hate speech, which is usually fertile in toxic words and is directed toward an individual or a community.

Fear speech, as the name suggests, attempts to incite fear about a target community. Although subtle, it might be highly effective, often pushing communities toward a physical conflict.

This article presents a large-scale study to understand the prevalence of 400K fear speech and over 700K hate speech posts collected from Gab.com.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，社交媒体平台进行了大量的审查，以防止在线仇恨言论的传播，这些言论通常充满有毒的词汇，是针对个人或社区的。由于这种严格的审查，越来越多的新颖而微妙的技术正在被部署。其中最引人注目的是恐惧言论。正如其名称所示，恐惧言论试图在目标社区中引起恐惧。虽然它是微妙的，但它可能非常有效，经常将社区推向身体冲突。因此，了解社交媒体中它们的普遍性是至关重要的。本文介绍了一项大规模研究，旨在了解从Gab.com收集的40万个恐惧言论和70多万个仇恨言论的普及率。值得注意的是，发布大量恐惧言论的用户比发布大量仇恨言论的用户获取更多的追随者，并在社交网络中占据更为核心的位置。与仇恨言论用户相比，他们还能更有效地接触到良性用户。我们的分析显示，用户对恐惧言论的接受程度在这一现象中发挥了重要作用。最后，我们讨论了研究结果的含义，并提出了可能检测和预防社交媒体中恐惧言论的方式。",

The findings suggest that fear speech is a new and subtle technique for inciting conflict, highlighting the need to detect and prevent it in social media platforms."
