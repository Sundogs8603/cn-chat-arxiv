    "translated_abstract": "利用部分一阶信息以循环方式进行优化可能是获得可扩展一阶方法的最自然策略。但是，尽管循环方案在实践中得到了广泛使用，但从理论角度来看，循环方案比随机方案不太被理解。我们受到了对广义变分不等式的外推循环方案分析最近成功的启发，提出了一种带有外推的加速循环坐标对偶平均法(A-CODER)用于复合凸优化，其中目标函数可以表示为通过梯度预言器访问的平滑凸函数和通过近端预言器访问的凸函数（可能是不平滑函数）的总和。我们证明了 A-CODER 实现了最优的收敛速度，并且与先前的工作相比，在块的数量依赖性上有了改进。此外，对于平滑部分为有限和形式的目标函数的设置，我们介绍了 variance。",
