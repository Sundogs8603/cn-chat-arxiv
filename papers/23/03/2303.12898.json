    "translated_abstract": "电子病历（EMR）存储在关系型数据库中。如果用户不熟悉数据库架构或数据库基础知识，则访问所需信息可能具有挑战性。因此，研究人员探索了文本到SQL生成方法，为医疗保健专业人员提供直接访问EMR数据，而无需数据库专家。然而，当前可用的数据集已被“解决”，最先进的模型已获得了大于或接近90%的准确度。本文中，我们展示了在医学领域解决文本到SQL生成仍有很长的路要走。为了证明这一点，我们创建了现有医学文本到SQL数据集MIMICSQL的新数据分割，更好地衡量了结果模型的泛化能力。我们评估了最先进的语言模型在我们的新数据分割上的表现，结果表明准确度从最高达92%降至28%，因此表明有大量改进的空间。",
