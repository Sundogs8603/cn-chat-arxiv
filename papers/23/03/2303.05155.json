    "abstract": "Many real-world applications based on online learning produce streaming data that is haphazard in nature, i.e., contains missing features, features becoming obsolete in time, the appearance of new features at later points in time and a lack of clarity on the total number of input features. These challenges make it hard to build a learnable system for such applications, and almost no work exists in deep learning that addresses this issue. In this paper, we present Aux-Drop, an auxiliary dropout regularization strategy for online learning that handles the haphazard input features in an effective manner. Aux-Drop adapts the conventional dropout regularization scheme for the haphazard input feature space ensuring that the final output is minimally impacted by the chaotic appearance of such features. It helps to prevent the co-adaptation of especially the auxiliary and base features, as well as reduces the strong dependence of the output on any of the auxiliary inputs of the model. This hel",

    "translated_title": "Aux-Drop: 使用辅助丢弃处理在线学习中的混乱输入",
    "translated_abstract": "许多基于在线学习的真实世界应用程序生成的流式数据具有混乱的特性，即包含缺失的特征，在时间上变得过时，以后出现新特征并且缺乏对总输入特征数量的清晰认识。这些挑战使得为这些应用构建可学习系统变得困难，并且几乎没有关于这个问题的深度学习研究工作。本文提出了Aux-Drop，一种用于在线学习的辅助丢失正则化策略，以有效处理混乱的输入特征。Aux-Drop为混乱的输入特征空间调整常规的丢失正则化方案，确保最终输出受到这些特征混乱出现的最小影响。它有助于防止特别是辅助和基础特征的共适应，并减少模型中任何辅助输入对输出的强烈依赖。这有助于为真实世界应用程序构建更健壮有效的在线学习系统。",
