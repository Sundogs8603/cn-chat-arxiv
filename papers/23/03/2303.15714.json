    "abstract": "Language models have been shown to perform remarkably well on a wide range of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel system that uses language models to perform multi-step logical reasoning. Our system incorporates explicit planning into its inference procedure, thus able to make more informed reasoning decisions at each step by looking ahead into their future effects. In our experiments, our full system significantly outperforms other competing systems. On a multiple-choice question answering task, our system performs competitively compared to GPT-3-davinci despite having only around 1.5B parameters. We conduct several ablation studies to demonstrate that explicit planning plays a crucial role in the system's performance.",
