Pointwise computing the Euler characteristic of a family of simplicial complexes built from data gives rise to the so-called Euler characteristic profile. We show that this simple descriptor achieve state-of-the-art performance in supervised tasks at a very low computational cost. Inspired by signal analysis, we compute hybrid transforms of Euler characteristic profiles. These integral transforms mix Euler characteristic techniques with Lebesgue integration to provide highly efficient compressors of topological signals. As a consequence, they show remarkable performances in unsupervised settings. On the qualitative side, we provide numerous heuristics on the topological and geometric information captured by Euler profiles and their hybrid transforms.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了拓扑数据分析中的欧拉特征技术。从数据构建的一族单纯复合体的点运算欧拉特征，得到所谓的欧拉特征轮廓。我们展示了这个简单描述符以极低的计算成本在监督任务中实现了最先进性能。受信号分析的启发，我们计算欧拉特征轮廓的混合变换。这些积分变换将欧拉特征技术与勒贝格积分混合，提供高效压缩拓扑信号。因此，它们在无监督设置中表现出卓越的性能。在定性方面，我们提供了关于欧拉轮廓及其混合变换所捕捉的拓扑和几何信息的众多启发式方法。最后，我们证明了这些描述符的稳定性结果以及在随机设置下的渐近保证。",
