    "abstract": "The recent \"pre-train, prompt, predict training\" paradigm has gained popularity as a way to learn generalizable models with limited labeled data. The approach involves using a pre-trained model and a prompting function that applies a template to input samples, adding indicative context and reformulating target tasks as the pre-training task. However, the design of prompts could be a challenging and time-consuming process in complex tasks. The limitation can be addressed by using graph data, as graphs serve as structured knowledge repositories by explicitly modeling the interaction between entities. In this survey, we review prompting methods from the graph perspective, where prompting functions are augmented with graph knowledge. In particular, we introduce the basic concepts of graph prompt learning, organize the existing work of designing graph prompting functions, and describe their applications and future challenges. This survey will bridge the gap between graphs and prompt design ",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，“预训练，提示，预测训练”范例已经成为一种用有限标记数据学习普适模型的方式。这种方法涉及使用预训练模型和一个提示函数，该函数将模板应用于输入样本，添加指示背景并将目标任务重构为预训练任务。然而，在复杂任务中设计提示可能是一个具有挑战性和耗时的过程。这种限制可以通过使用图数据来解决，因为图形作为显式地建模实体之间交互的结构化知识库。在这个调查中，我们从图的角度审查提示方法，其中提示函数使用图知识进行扩展。特别是，我们介绍了图形提示学习的基本概念，组织了设计图形提示函数的现有工作，并描述了它们的应用和未来挑战。本调查将弥合图形和提示设计之间的差距。",
