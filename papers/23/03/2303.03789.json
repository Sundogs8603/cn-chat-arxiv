    "abstract": "Given a huge, online stream of time-evolving events with multiple attributes, such as online shopping logs: (item, price, brand, time), and local mobility activities: (pick-up and drop-off locations, time), how can we summarize large, dynamic high-order tensor streams? How can we see any hidden patterns, rules, and anomalies? Our answer is to focus on two types of patterns, i.e., ''regimes'' and ''components'', for which we present CubeScope, an efficient and effective method over high-order tensor streams. Specifically, it identifies any sudden discontinuity and recognizes distinct dynamical patterns, ''regimes'' (e.g., weekday/weekend/holiday patterns). In each regime, it also performs multi-way summarization for all attributes (e.g., item, price, brand, and time) and discovers hidden ''components'' representing latent groups (e.g., item/brand groups) and their relationship. Thanks to its concise but effective summarization, CubeScope can also detect the sudden appearance of anomalie",
