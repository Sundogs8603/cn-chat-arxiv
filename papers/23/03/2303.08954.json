    "abstract": "Research interest in task-oriented dialogs has increased as systems such as Google Assistant, Alexa and Siri have become ubiquitous in everyday life. However, the impact of academic research in this area has been limited by the lack of datasets that realistically capture the wide array of user pain points. To enable research on some of the more challenging aspects of parsing realistic conversations, we introduce PRESTO, a public dataset of over 550K contextual multilingual conversations between humans and virtual assistants. PRESTO contains a diverse array of challenges that occur in real-world NLU tasks such as disfluencies, code-switching, and revisions. It is the only large scale human generated conversational parsing dataset that provides structured context such as a user's contacts and lists for each example. Our mT5 model based baselines demonstrate that the conversational phenomenon present in PRESTO are challenging to model, which is further pronounced in a low-resource setup.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着Google Assistant、Alexa和Siri等系统在日常生活中变得普遍，人们对任务导向型对话的研究兴趣不断增加。然而，在捕捉各种用户痛点的实际情况方面缺乏实际数据集，这限制了学术研究在这一领域的影响。为了使关于解析逼真对话的一些挑战性方面的研究成为可能，我们引入了PRESTO，一个包含超过55万个人与虚拟助手之间的上下文多语言对话的公共数据集。PRESTO包含了真实NLU任务中出现的多样化挑战，如说话不连贯、代码切换和修正。它是唯一一个提供每个示例的结构化上下文，如用户的联系人和列表的大规模人类生成会话解析数据集。我们基于mT5模型的基线表明，PRESTO中存在的对话现象具有挑战性，这在低资源设置中更加明显。",
