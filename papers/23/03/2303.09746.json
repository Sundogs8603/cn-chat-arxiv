    "translated_abstract": "异常检测旨在提高标准深度神经网络（DNN）的性能，以从原始训练数据中区分异常输入。以往的方法需要在分布内和分布外的数据上进行训练，但是在实际场景中，由于隐私和安全性问题，辅助数据往往不切实际。本文提出了一种不需要自然数据训练的数据无关方法，称为类条件印象再现（C2IR），它利用来自固定模型的图像印象来恢复类条件的特征统计信息。基于此，我们引入积分概率度量，估计层级别的类条件偏差，并通过测量基于梯度的重要性（MGI）获取层权重。实验证明了我们方法的有效性，并表明C2IR优于其他后续方法，并达到了与全访问（ID和OOD）检测方法相当的性能。",
