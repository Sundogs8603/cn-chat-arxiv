    "translated_abstract": "反事实（CF）解释，也称为对比解释和算法回归，被广泛用于解释高风险领域中的机器学习模型。针对一个受到负面预测的主体（例如，拒绝房贷申请），CF解释是相似的情况，但预测结果为正面，这告知主体改进的方法。尽管它们的各种属性已经被研究，例如有效性和稳定性，但我们提供了一种新颖的属性：在迭代部分履行（IPF）下的行为。具体地，在接收到CF解释后，主体可能只能部分地履行它，然后请求一个新的预测及新的解释，重复此过程直到预测为正面。这种部分履行可能是由于主体的能力有限（例如，此时只能支付四张信用卡帐户中的两张）或试图冒险（例如，押注800美元的月薪增长足够）。",
