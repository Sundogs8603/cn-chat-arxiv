    "translated_abstract": "尽管5G框架具有强大的安全功能，攻击者仍将发现方法来破坏5G无人机（UAV）操作，并降低空地（A2G）链路中的UAV控制通信性能。在假设5G UAV通信基础设施永远不会完全安全的情况下，我们提出了深度注意力识别（DAtR）作为解决方案，它可以基于嵌入经认证的UAV中的小型深度网络来识别攻击。我们的方案使用两个可观测参数：信干噪比（SINR）和参考信号接收功率（RSSI），以识别具有直射视线（LoS）、非直射视线（NLoS）和两种条件的概率性组合的攻击。在测试的场景中，攻击者位于随机位置，其功率在每个模拟中都有所改变。此外，地面用户也被包含在网络中，以对攻击检测施加额外的复杂性。",
