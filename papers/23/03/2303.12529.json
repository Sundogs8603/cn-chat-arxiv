    "translated_abstract": "随着先进工艺节点中特征尺寸的不断缩小，掩模优化在传统设计流程中变得越来越重要，并伴随着光刻近似校正(OPC)方法中计算开销的爆炸式增长。最近, 反向光刻技术(ILT)已经引起了重视, 并在新兴的 OPC 解决方案中变得流行。然而，ILT方法要么耗时，要么掩模印刷性能和可制造性不足。本文提出了DevelSet，一种GPU和深度神经网络(DNN)加速的水平集金属光刻掩模综合框架。我们首先通过引入曲率项来降低掩模复杂度并应用GPU加速来克服计算瓶颈，改进了传统的基于水平集的ILT算法。为了进一步提高可打印性和快速迭代收敛，我们提出了一种新颖的深度神经网络，利用水平集固有原理巧妙地设计。",
