    "abstract": "We consider the problem of information aggregation in federated decision making, where a group of agents collaborate to infer the underlying state of nature without sharing their private data with the central processor or each other. We analyze the non-Bayesian social learning strategy in which agents incorporate their individual observations into their opinions (i.e., soft-decisions) with Bayes rule, and the central processor aggregates these opinions by arithmetic or geometric averaging. Building on our previous work, we establish that both pooling strategies result in asymptotic normality characterization of the system, which, for instance, can be utilized to derive approximate expressions for the error probability. We verify the theoretical findings with simulations and compare both strategies.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑联邦决策制定中的信息聚合问题，其中一组代理合作推断自然界的潜在状态，而不与中央处理器或彼此共享其私人数据。我们分析了非贝叶斯社会学习策略，其中代理将其个人观察结果使用贝叶斯规则合并为意见（即软决策），然后中央处理器通过算术或几何平均数聚合这些意见。建立在我们以前的工作之上，我们确定了两种汇集策略都可以导致系统的渐近正态性特征描述，例如，可以利用它们推导出错误概率的近似表达式。我们使用模拟验证理论发现，并比较了这两种策略。",
