    "translated_abstract": "能够在计算机上执行通用任务的代理可以通过自动化重复任务和协助复杂问题的解决来提高效率和生产力。理想情况下，这些代理应该能够通过自然语言命令解决新的计算机任务。然而，先前解决这个问题的方法需要大量专家示范和任务特定的奖励函数，这两者对于新任务来说都不切实际。在这项工作中，我们展示了一个预先训练的大型语言模型（LLM）代理可以使用一个简单的提示方案（RCI），通过自然语言指导执行计算机任务，并在批评和改进输出的过程中取得很好的效果。RCI方法在自动化计算机任务方面明显优于现有的LLM方法，并在MiniWoB++基准测试中超越了监督学习（SL）和强化学习（RL）方法。RCI方法使用每个任务仅有的少数示范，与最新的SL+RL方法相竞争。",
