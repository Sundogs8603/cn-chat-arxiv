    "abstract": "Due to the emergence of AI systems that interact with the physical environment, there is an increased interest in incorporating physical reasoning capabilities into those AI systems. But is it enough to only have physical reasoning capabilities to operate in a real physical environment? In the real world, we constantly face novel situations we have not encountered before. As humans, we are competent at successfully adapting to those situations. Similarly, an agent needs to have the ability to function under the impact of novelties in order to properly operate in an open-world physical environment. To facilitate the development of such AI systems, we propose a new testbed, NovPhy, that requires an agent to reason about physical scenarios in the presence of novelties and take actions accordingly. The testbed consists of tasks that require agents to detect and adapt to novelties in physical scenarios. To create tasks in the testbed, we develop eight novelties representing a diverse novelt",

    "translated_abstract": "随着与物理环境交互的AI系统的出现，将物理推理能力融入这些AI系统越来越受关注。但仅仅具备物理推理能力是否足以在真实物理环境中运行？在现实世界中，我们经常面对之前从未遇到过的新颖情况。作为人类，我们能够成功地适应这些情况。同样，一个智能体需要具备在面对新颖情况时正常运作的能力，才能在开放世界的物理环境中有效运行。为了推动这样的AI系统的发展，我们提出了一个新的测试平台NovPhy，要求智能体在存在新颖情况的物理场景中进行推理并相应地采取行动。测试平台包括需要智能体检测和适应物理场景中的新颖情况的任务。为了创建测试平台中的任务，我们开发了八种代表不同新颖情况的创新点。",
