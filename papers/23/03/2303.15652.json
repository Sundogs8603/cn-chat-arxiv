    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑在流式纵向数据设置中的动态定价策略，目的是最大化在大量客户细分中的累计利润。我们考虑一种动态概率模型，其中消费者的偏好和价格敏感度随时间变化。基于这一众所周知的发现，具有相似特征的消费者会表现出相似的行为，我们考虑一种全局收缩结构，该结构假定不同细分中的消费者偏好可以用空间自回归模型很好地近似。在这样的流式纵向设置中，我们通过遗憾来衡量动态定价策略的性能，遗憾是与预先知道模型参数序列的千里眼相比预期的收入损失。我们提出了一种基于惩罚随机梯度下降（PSGD）的定价策略，并明确地将其遗憾作为时间函数、模型参数的时间变化性和消费者数据集的规模。",

The regret is explicitly characterized as a function of time, the temporal variability in the model parameters, and the size of the consumer dataset."
