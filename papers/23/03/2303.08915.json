    "translated_abstract": "提取DNA字符的第一个重要步骤是使用MinION设备的输出数据，以电流信号的形式呈现。各种尖端的碱基识别器使用这些数据来根据输入来检测DNA字符。本文讨论了先前碱基识别器在时间关键应用、隐私感知设计和灾难性遗忘问题等方面的若干不足。接着，我们提出了LRDB模型，这是一个轻量级开源模型，可用于私有开发，在本文中针对目标细菌样本具有更好的读取标识（增加了0.35%）。我们限制了训练数据的范围，并受益于迁移学习算法，使得LRDB在关键应用中的主动使用具有可行性。因此，适应新的DNA样本（在我们的案例中为细菌样本）需要更少的训练时间。此外，根据用户约束条件，可以修改LRDB，因为结果显示，在使用f的情况下，准确度损失可以忽略不计。",
