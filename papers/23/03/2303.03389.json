    "translated_abstract": "深度聚类一直被平面模型所占主导地位，这些模型将数据集分成预定义数量的组。尽管最近的方法在流行的基准测试中与基本事实的相似度非常高，但平面分区提供的信息有限。本文介绍了一种基于深度神经网络的对比层次聚类模型 CoHiClust，可应用于典型图像数据。通过采用自监督学习方法，CoHiClust 可以将基础网络蒸馏为二叉树，而不需要访问任何标记的数据。层次聚类结构可以用于分析聚类之间的关系以及衡量数据点之间的相似度。实验证明，CoHiClust 生成了一个合理的聚类结构，符合我们的直觉和图像语义。此外，它与最先进的平面聚类相比，在大多数图像数据集上获得了更高的聚类准确性。",
