    "translated_abstract": "在安全领域，多目标安全博弈(MOSGs)允许防御者同时保护多个异质性攻击者的目标。MOSGs旨在同时最大化所有异质性回报，例如生命、金钱和犯罪率，而不合并异质性攻击者。在现实世界的场景中，需要保护的异质性攻击者和目标数量可能超出大多数现有的最先进的方法的能力，MOSGs受到可扩展性问题的限制。因此，本文提出了一个通用框架称为SDES，该框架基于多目标进化搜索来扩展MOSGs的大规模目标和异质性攻击者。SDES由四个连续的关键组成部分组成，即离散化、优化、恢复和评估以及改进。具体来说，SDES使用博弈理论中的最大不平等性原理将原始的高维连续解空间离散化为低维离散解空间。",
