    "abstract": "The cryptocurrency ecosystem has been the centre of discussion on many social media platforms, following its noted volatility and varied opinions. Twitter is rapidly being utilised as a news source and a medium for bitcoin discussion. Our algorithm seeks to use historical prices and sentiment of tweets to forecast the price of Bitcoin. In this study, we develop an end-to-end model that can forecast the sentiment of a set of tweets (using a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers - based Neural Network Model) and forecast the price of Bitcoin (using Gated Recurrent Unit) using the predicted sentiment and other metrics like historical cryptocurrency price data, tweet volume, a user's following, and whether or not a user is verified. The sentiment prediction gave a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 9.45%, an average of real-time data, and test data. The mean absolute percent error for the price prediction was 3.6%.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着加密货币的波动性及多样化的意见，在许多社交媒体平台上都成为了讨论的中心话题。Twitter 迅速成为新闻来源和比特币讨论的媒介。我们的算法旨在利用历史价格和推文情感来预测比特币的价格。在本研究中，我们开发了一种端到端模型，可使用双向编码器转换的神经网络模型预测推文集的情感，并使用预测的情感以及历史加密货币价格数据、推文数量、用户的追随者数量以及用户是否通过验证来预测比特币的价格。情感预测的平均绝对百分比误差为9.45％，反应了实时数据和测试数据的平均误差。而价格预测的平均绝对百分比误差则为3.6％。",
