    "translated_abstract": "研究常见神经疾病的挑战之一是疾病异质性，包括病因、神经成像特征、合并症或基因变异的差异。规范建模已成为研究这种人群的流行方法，其中对生理系统的“正常”行为进行建模，并可以用于个体层面上检测与疾病病理相关的偏差。对于许多异质性疾病，我们预计会观察到多种神经成像和生物变量的异常。然而，到目前为止，规范模型主要是为了研究单一成像模态而开发的。我们旨在开发一种多模态规范建模框架，在多个模态的变量中聚合异常性，并且比单模式基线更能检测到偏差。我们提出了两种用于检测T1和DTI数据中的个体层面偏差的多模态VAE规范模型。与单模式基线相比，我们提出的模型能够更好地检测到轻度认知受损的受试者中的偏差，证明了多模态规范建模用于疾病异质性的潜力。",
