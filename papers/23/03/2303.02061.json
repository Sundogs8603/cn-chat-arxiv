    "translated_abstract": "有效的风险转移是确保市场可持续性的重要条件，根据建立在经济学文献中的理论。在一个低效的市场中，可能会产生重大的财务不平衡，可能危及到一些市场参与者的偿付能力。由于网络威胁不断演变和缺乏公共数据共享，使得引用的网络保险费率被认为是高效的经济条件非常不可能被满足。本文通过蒙特卡罗模拟研究了一个人工网络保险市场，并根据市场参与者之间的信息设置，比较了高效和低效的结果。通过网络威胁的动态性和缺乏可靠和集中化的事故报告，证明了损失分布的多样性的存在是合理的。结果显示，当损失预期不被共享时，再保险公司的参与程度有限，导致保费增加，同时降低了总体的风险转移能力。",
