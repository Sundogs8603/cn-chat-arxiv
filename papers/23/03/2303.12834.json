    "translated_abstract": "量子过程学习是研究量子系统的重要工具之一。然而大部分研究都放在了自旋相干和器件自耦合的波动函数上，研究量子动力学在系统和目标不直接交互的情况下是否可以被学习并没有得到足够的关注。这类不相干的框架实际上非常吸引人，因为它们能够在不需要挑战性的混合纠缠方案中，为我们提供在不同物理平台之间转移量子过程的方法。在本文中，我们通过分析需要仿真的明确的相干学习策略的测量次数，提供了在不相干框架下学习幺正过程样本复杂度的界限。我们证明，如果允许任意测量，则任何有效表示的幺正矩阵都可以在不相干框架内被有效地学习；然而，如果仅限于浅层测量，则只能有效地学习低纠缠门。因此，我们的工作突出了学习量子动力学在不相干框架中的能力与局限性。",

While incoherent frameworks provide practical methods for transpiling quantum processes between different physical platforms, the study shows that when restricted to shallow-depth measurements, only low-entangled gates can be efficiently learned."
