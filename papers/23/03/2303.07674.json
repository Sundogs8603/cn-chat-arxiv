    "translated_abstract": "Koos分级标准是诊断前庭神经鞘瘤（VS）的分类系统，用于描述瘤体及其对相邻脑结构的影响。尽管对比增强T1（ceT1）扫描和高分辨率T2（hrT2）扫描均可用于Koos分类，但由于hrT2扫描更安全、更具成本效益，因此hrT2扫描备受关注。然而，在缺乏hrT2扫描注释的情况下，深度学习方法往往会因无监督学习而性能下降。如果ceT1扫描及其注释可用于hrT2扫描的无监督学习，使用未标记的hrT2扫描进行Koos分类的性能将大大提高。因此，我们提出了一种基于图像翻译的无监督跨模态域自适应方法，将带注释的ceT1扫描转换为hrT2扫描，然后用其训练一个分类器来进行未标记的hrT2扫描的Koos分类。在真实数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的方法在不需要注释时使用hrT2扫描可实现精确的Koos分类，具有更好的性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an unsupervised cross-modality domain adaptation method based on image translation, which can transform annotated ceT1 scans into hrT2 scans for Koos classification of unlabeled hrT2 scans. The proposed method avoids the problem of inaccurate classification due to the lack of annotations for hrT2 scans and achieves better performance."
