    "translated_abstract": "近来，基于时间图的图神经网络(GNNs)引起越来越多的关注，其中一个常见的假设是节点类别集合是封闭的。然而，在实际情况中，随着时间的推移，往往会面对动态增加类别的开放集问题。对现有的动态GNN方法提出了两个重大挑战：(i) 如何在开放的时间图中动态传播适当的信息，其中新类节点往往与旧类节点相连。这种情况将导致一个尖锐的矛盾。这是因为典型的GNN倾向于使连接节点的嵌入变得相似，而我们希望这两个交互节点的嵌入是可区分的，因为它们属于不同的类别。(ii)如何在学习新的类别时避免在时间图中出现的旧类别的灾难性知识遗忘。在本文中，我们提出了一种适用于开放时间图的通用和有原则的学习方法。",
