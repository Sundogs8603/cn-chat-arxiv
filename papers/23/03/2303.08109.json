    "abstract": "We compared the efficiency of the FlyHash model, an insect-inspired sparse neural network (Dasgupta et al., 2017), to similar but non-sparse models in an embodied navigation task. This requires a model to control steering by comparing current visual inputs to memories stored along a training route. We concluded the FlyHash model is more efficient than others, especially in terms of data encoding.",
