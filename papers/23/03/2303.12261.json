    "translated_abstract": "许多机械工程应用需要多尺度计算建模和模拟。然而，解决复杂的多尺度系统仍然具有高维度的解空间，计算量巨大。近年来，机器学习（ML）已经成为一种有前途的解决方案，可以作为传统数值方法的代理、加速或增强。先驱性的工作已经证明，ML可以提供与直接数值方法相当精度的控制方程的解决方案，但计算速度显著更快。这些高速、高精度的估计可以通过为传统解算器提供更好的初始解决方案，促进复杂的多尺度系统的解决。本文就使用ML进行复杂多尺度建模和模拟的机遇和挑战提供了一个视角。我们首先概述了用于模拟多尺度系统的现有ML方法，然后讨论了它们提高多尺度模拟速度和精度的潜力。最后，我们确定了为多尺度仿真开发ML算法所面临的挑战和未解决问题，并讨论了可能的研究方向。",
