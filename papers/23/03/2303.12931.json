    "abstract": "Our goal is to develop a general strategy to decompose a random variable $X$ into multiple independent random variables, without sacrificing any information about unknown parameters. A recent paper showed that for some well-known natural exponential families, $X$ can be \"thinned\" into independent random variables $X^{(1)}, \\ldots, X^{(K)}$, such that $X = \\sum_{k=1}^K X^{(k)}$. In this paper, we generalize their procedure by relaxing this summation requirement and simply asking that some known function of the independent random variables exactly reconstruct $X$. This generalization of the procedure serves two purposes. First, it greatly expands the families of distributions for which thinning can be performed. Second, it unifies sample splitting and data thinning, which on the surface seem to be very different, as applications of the same principle. This shared principle is sufficiency. We use this insight to perform generalized thinning operations for a diverse set of families.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在开发一种将随机变量X分解为多个独立随机变量的通用策略，而不会丢失任何有关未知参数的信息。我们通过松弛求和要求并仅要求一些已知的独立随机变量的函数完全重构X来推广了最近一篇论文的过程。该过程的推广有两个目的。首先，它极大地扩展了可进行稀化的分布族。其次，它统一了样本分裂和数据稀化，它们在表面上似乎非常不同，但应用了同样的原理。这个共同的原理是充分性。我们利用这一认识对各种不同的家族进行广义稀疏化操作。",
