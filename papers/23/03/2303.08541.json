    "translated_abstract": "提出了一种U-Net卷积神经网络架构的变体，用于估计a-Zr（hcp）多晶晶粒结构中的线性弹性兼容应力。使用VGrain软件生成训练数据，晶粒结构的正则性α为0.73，且具有均匀随机方向，使用ABAQUS对应力焊缝进行有限元方法评估。初始数据集包含200个样本，其中20个用于验证的保留。与有限元分析相比，网络在CPU或GPU上可以加速约200倍至6000倍，并具有显著的内存节省，准确度略微降低最多10％。网络性能与晶粒结构的规则性或纹理无关，表明网络可以推广到任意的Zr晶体结构。测量了使用200和400个样本进行训练时的性能，发现当数据集的大小增加一倍时，准确度约提高10％。",
