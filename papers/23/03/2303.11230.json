    "translated_abstract": "随机网络的统计建模被广泛用于揭示复杂系统中的相互作用机制和预测现实世界中未观测到的网络链接。在许多应用中，网络连接是通过自我为中心的采样收集的：首先对节点的子集进行采样，然后记录涉及该子集的所有链接；所有其他信息都缺失。与“均匀随机缺失”的假设相比，以自我为中心采样的部分网络需要特别设计的建模策略。当前的统计方法要么计算上不可行，要么基于直觉设计而没有理论依据。在这里，我们提出了一种适用于以自我为中心采样的网络的低秩通用模型的方法，其中包括几种流行的网络模型。该方法基于图谱特性且具有计算效率，适用于大规模网络。由于该方法能够恢复由自我为中心采样引起的缺失子网络，因此得到了稳健的恢复。",
