    "translated_abstract": "主动管理的投资组合往往长期内无法击败市场。因此，许多投资者通常转向被动管理的投资组合，旨在跟踪某个金融指数。建立这样的被动组合并最小化交易成本的任务称为指数跟踪（IT），其目标是通过仅持有指数中一小部分的资产来跟踪指数。由于是NP难问题，对于超过100个资产的指数来说，确切解法变得不可行。在本文中，我们提出了一种新型的混合模拟退火方法，可以高效地解决大型指数的IT问题，并且足够灵活以适应财务相关的约束条件。通过跟踪2011年至2018年之间的标准普尔500指数，我们展示了我们的算法能够在过去收益的样本期间中找到最优解，并且可以调整以在未来收益的样本期间中提供最优收益。最后，我们关注了IT问题中的稳定性，并展示了我们的算法能够克服收益非稳定性这一现象。",

The algorithm can adapt to financially relevant constraints and overcome the instability of returns. The proposed method is demonstrated on the S&P-500 index and provides optimal solutions in both in- and out-of-sample periods."
