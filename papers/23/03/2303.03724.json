    "translated_abstract": "最近在基于深度强化学习的技术和在仿真中进行训练方面取得的进展为开发具有鲁棒控制器的腿式机器人提供了一种新方法。然而，这些方法在真实硬件上的应用主要局限于具有直驱执行器的四足机器人和具有低齿轮传动系统的轻型双足机器人。对于真实大小的人形机器人，由于具有较大的仿真到真实世界的差距，应用较少。本文提出了一种有效克服人形机器人中由于在执行器级别上的扭矩跟踪不准确而产生的仿真到真实世界差距问题的方法。我们的关键思想是在仿真环境中通过训练策略，在人工降级的贫弱扭矩跟踪条件下利用真实机器人上的执行器电流反馈。我们的方法成功地在仿真中训练了一个统一的端到端策略，可以在真实的HRP-5P人形机器人上部署，实现双足行走。",
