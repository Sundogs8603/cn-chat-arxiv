    "abstract": "Recent expressive text to speech (TTS) models focus on synthesizing emotional speech, but some fine-grained styles such as intonation are neglected. In this paper, we propose QI-TTS which aims to better transfer and control intonation to further deliver the speaker's questioning intention while transferring emotion from reference speech. We propose a multi-style extractor to extract style embedding from two different levels. While the sentence level represents emotion, the final syllable level represents intonation. For fine-grained intonation control, we use relative attributes to represent intonation intensity at the syllable level.Experiments have validated the effectiveness of QI-TTS for improving intonation expressiveness in emotional speech synthesis.",

    "translated_abstract": "近期的情感语音合成模型主要关注合成表达情感的语音，但一些细粒度的风格，例如语调，被忽略了。本文提出了 QI-TTS，旨在更好地转移和控制语调，在转移情感的同时传递发言者的疑问意图。我们提出了一个多风格提取器，从两个不同层次提取风格信息。虽然句子层次表示情感，但最终的音节层次则表示语调。为了进行细粒度的语调控制，我们使用相对属性来表示音节层次的语调强度。实验验证了 QI-TTS 在情感语音合成中提高语调表现力的有效性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes QI-TTS, a method for emotional speech synthesis with questioning intonation control. By using a multi-style extractor and relative attributes to control intonation intensity at the syllable level, it can better express the questioning intention of the speaker in addition to emotional states. The effectiveness of QI-TTS in improving the expressive power of intonation in emotional speech synthesis has been validated by experiments."
