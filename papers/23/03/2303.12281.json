    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种使用扩散概率模型（DPMs）模拟电子健康记录（EHRs）的新方法。我们展示了DPMs在合成捕获数值，二进制和分类变量的纵向EHRs方面的有效性。据我们所知，这是第一次使用DPMs实现这个目的。我们将DPM合成的数据集与以往使用生成对抗网络（GANs）的最新研究结果进行了比较，应用于两种临床应用：急性低血压和人类免疫缺陷病毒（HIV ART）。鉴于以前在DPMs方面缺乏类似的研究，我们的工作核心组成部分是探索在许多方面使用DPMs的优点和注意事项。除了评估合成数据集的逼真性之外，我们还在合成数据上训练了强化学习（RL）代理以评估它们支持下游机器学习开发的实用性。",
