    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的、可证明收敛的算法，用于在弦度量下计算旗型流形上一组点的旗形均值和旗形中值。旗型流形是一种数学空间，由嵌套的向量空间子空间序列组成，并且在维度上逐渐增加。旗型流形是已知的许多矩阵群的超集，包括Stiefel和Grassmanians，使其成为在各种计算机视觉问题中非常有用的通用对象。为了解决计算一阶旗帜统计数据的挑战，我们首先将问题转化为涉及辅助变量受Stiefel流形约束的问题。Stiefel流形是一组正交框架的空间，利用Stiefel流形优化的数值稳定性和效率，可以有效地计算旗形均值。通过一系列实验证明了我们的方法在Grassmann和旋转均值以及主成分问题中的有效性。",
