    "translated_abstract": "最近的开放词汇检测方法旨在通过从训练在大量图像文本对上的视觉语言模型（VLM）中蒸馏知识来检测新的对象。为了提高这些方法的有效性，研究人员利用了一个包含大量对象类的大词汇数据集，以假设这样的数据将使模型提取关于各种对象之间关系的综合知识，并更好地推广到看不见的对象类别。在这项研究中，我们认为需要更精细的标签来提取丰富的有关新对象的知识，包括对象属性和关系，而不仅仅是它们的名称。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一个名为伪标注标签（PCL）的简单而有效的方法，该方法利用图像字幕模型生成描述来自不同角度的对象实例的字幕。由此产生的伪字幕标签为知识提供了密集的样本。",
