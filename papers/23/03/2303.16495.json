While acknowledging these issues, we have identified a further challenge that currently seems underappreciated - the potential distinction between trust as one construct and \\emph{distrust} as a second construct independent of trust. While there has been long-standing academic discourse for this distinction and arguments for both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional conceptualization of trust, distrust seems relatively understudied in XAI. In this position paper, we not only highlight the theoretical arguments for distrust as a distinct construct from trust but also contextualize psychometric evidence that likewise favors",
