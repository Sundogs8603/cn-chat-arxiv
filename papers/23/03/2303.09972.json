Therefore, they do not guarantee that similar objects have similar outlier scores. To verify our proposed hypothesis, we propose an outlier score post-processing technique for outlier detectors, called neighborhood averaging(NA), which pays attention to objects and their neighbors and guarantees them to have more similar outlier scores than their original scores. Given an object and its outlier score from any outlier detector, NA modifies its outlier score by combining it with its k nearest neighbors' scores. We demonstrate the effectivity of NA by using the well-known k-nearest neighbors (k-NN).

    "translated_abstract": "我们假设相似的对象应该有相似的异常分数。据我们所知，所有现有的异常检测器都独立地为每个对象计算异常分数，而不考虑其他对象的异常分数。因此，它们不能保证相似的对象具有相似的异常分数。为了验证我们提出的假设，我们提出了一种名为邻域平均（NA）的异常分数后处理技术，它关注对象及其邻居，并保证它们具有比原始分数更相似的异常分数。给定任何异常检测器中的对象及其异常分数，NA通过将其与其k个最近邻居的分数相结合，修改其异常分数。我们使用知名的k-最近邻（k-NN）证明了NA的有效性。实验结果表明，在九个真实世界数据集上评估，NA将所有测试的10个基线检测器平均改进了13％（从0.70到0.79 AUC）。",
