We employ fundamental duality results from real constrained optimization to formally derive a dual representation of the associated HJB PDE.

This condition is used to derive an explicit expression for the optimal allocation-constrained portfolio up to a deterministic minimizer and the solution to a system of Riccati ODEs in a market with CIR volatility and in a market with multi-factor OU short rate.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文在不完全的金融市场中研究了预期实用投资组合优化问题，其中风险资产动态取决于随机因素，投资组合分配受限于给定的凸集。我们利用实数约束优化的基本对偶结果正式推导了相关HJB PDE的对偶表示。利用这种表示方法，我们提供了一个条件，该条件确保HJB PDE的解是指数仿射和可分离的，该条件用于在具有CIR波动率和具有多因子OU短期利率的市场中导出收益率的显式表达式，以及一个确定性微小化者和Riccati ODE系统的解。",
