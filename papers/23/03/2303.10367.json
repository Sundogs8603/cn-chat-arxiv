    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的实证文献发现，企业通过提高零售价将最低工资上涨的成本转嫁给消费者。然而，我们很少了解最低工资对批发价格的影响以及零售商是否面对除劳动成本冲击外的批发成本冲击。本文利用华盛顿州合法的休闲大麻产业的独特市场结构，研究最低工资对批发和零售价格的影响。在一个动态差分差异架构中，利用供应链上60亿美元交易的扫描数据，并利用在2018年至2021年之间六次最低工资的涨幅中企业最低工资曝露的地理差异。当忽略批发成本效应时，我发现零售价格弹性与现有文献一致，但一旦考虑到批发成本效应，零售价格弹性会增加一倍以上。零售利润率不会调整以适应批发成本冲击，表明完全转嫁了成本。",
