    "translated_abstract": "我们建立了一个随机逆问题的框架，该问题具有实时的图上观测，并提出了一种基于在线数据流的分布式在线学习算法，将希尔伯特空间中的分布参数估计和再生核希尔伯特空间中的最小均方问题统一起来。我们将算法收敛性转化为带有L2有界鞅差分项的希尔伯特空间中随机时变差分方程的渐近稳定性，并发展了L2-渐近稳定性理论。结果表明，如果网络图是连通的，并且正向算子序列满足无限维度时空励磁条件，则所有节点的估计均为均方和几乎必然的强一致的。通过将RKHS中的分布式学习问题等效地转化为图上随机逆问题，我们提出了一种基于无中心节点的RKHS分布式在线学习算法。",

A new L2-asymptotic stability theory is developed, and the algorithm is shown to achieve mean square and almost surely strongly consistent estimates under the condition of a connected network graph and the infinitedimensional spatio-temporal persistence of excitation of the forward operators. The RKHS distributed learning problem is equivalently transformed to the random inverse problem over graphs."
