    "translated_abstract": "鲁棒的术中图像数据的语义分割可以为自动手术场景理解和自主机器人手术铺平道路。然而，由于手术程序的变化或操作部位的遮挡，几何域转换在现实世界的开放手术中普遍存在，但在该领域仍然是一个未被广泛讨论的主题。为了填补文献中的空白，我们（1）在几何域的分布转换数据存在下，提出了对最新的语义分割网络进行分析，并（2）通过一种名为“器官移植”的专用增强技术来解决泛化性问题，该技术是我们从一般计算机视觉社区中改编的。通过对包括来自33只猪的600个RGB和高光谱成像数据集在内的六个不同分布转换数据集进行全面验证，我们证明了SOA器官分割网络在几何分布转换数据上表现出较大的性能下降。令人惊讶的是，这些网络在语义上注释了19个类别的高光谱成像（HSI）立方体的器官分割。",
