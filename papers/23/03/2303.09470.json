    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new approach for addressing the challenge of training machine learning models in the presence of noisy labels. By combining a clever usage of distance to class centroids in the items' latent space with a discounting strategy to reduce the importance of samples far away from all the class centroids (i.e., outliers), our method effectively addresses the issue of noisy labels. Our approach is based on the idea that samples farther away from their respective class centroid in the early stages of training are more likely to be noisy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on several popular benchmark datasets. Our results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in this area, achieving significant improvements in classification accuracy when the dataset contains noisy labels.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的方法，用于解决在存在噪声标签的情况下训练机器学习模型的挑战。通过在物品的潜在空间中巧妙地使用距离类中心的方法，再结合折扣策略以减少距离所有类中心（即异常值）远的样本的重要性，我们的方法有效解决了噪声标签的问题。我们的方法是基于这样的想法：在训练的早期阶段，距离各自类中心更远的样本更可能是噪声。通过在几个流行的基准数据集上进行广泛实验，我们证明了我们的方法的有效性。结果表明，我们的方法在存在噪声标签的情况下，可以明显提高分类准确性，表现优于当前领域的最优方法。",
