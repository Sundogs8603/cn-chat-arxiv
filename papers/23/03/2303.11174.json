    "abstract": "As online dating has become more popular in the past few years, an efficient and effective algorithm to match users is needed. In this project, we proposed a new dating matching algorithm that uses Kendall-Tau distance to measure the similarity between users based on their ranking for items in a list. (e.g., their favourite sports, music, etc.) To increase the performance of the search process, we applied a tree-based searching structure, Cascading Metric Tree (CMT), on this metric. The tree is built on ranked lists from all the users; when a query target and a radius are provided, our algorithm can return users within the radius of the target. We tested the scaling of this searching method on a synthetic dataset by varying list length, population size, and query radius. We observed that the algorithm is able to query the best matching people for the user in a practical time, given reasonable parameters. We also provided potential future improvements that can be made to this algorithm ",

    "translated_abstract": "随着在线约会在过去几年中变得越来越流行，需要一种高效且有效的算法来匹配用户。在这个项目中，我们提出了一种新的约会匹配算法，该算法使用Kendall-Tau距离来衡量用户在列表中对项目（例如，他们喜欢的运动、音乐等）的排序相似度。为了提高搜索过程的性能，我们在此度量上应用了一种基于树的搜索结构，级联度量树（CMT）。该树是建立在所有用户的排名列表上的；当提供查询目标和半径时，我们的算法可以返回目标半径内的用户。我们通过变化列表长度、人口规模和查询半径，在合成数据集上测试了该搜索方法的可扩展性。我们观察到，该算法能够在合理的参数下，在实际时间内查询到最佳匹配的人。我们还提供了对该算法的潜在未来改进措施。",
