    "translated_abstract": "心率变异性(HRV)测量连续心跳时间的变化，是身心健康的主要指标。最近的研究表明，可以使用光电容积描记仪(PPG)传感器推断HRV。然而，许多先前的研究存在较高的误差，因为它们仅使用信号处理或机器学习(ML)，或者因为它们间接推断HRV，或者因为缺少大数据集。许多先前的研究也可能需要大的ML模型。低的准确率和大的模型大小限制了它们在小型嵌入式设备和未来可能在医疗保健中的应用。为了解决上述问题，我们首先收集了一个大的PPG信号和HRV的基本事实数据集。通过这个数据集，我们开发了结合信号处理和ML的HRV模型，直接推断HRV。评估结果表明，我们的方法的误差在3.5%到25.7%之间，并且优于单独使用信号处理或ML的方法。我们还探讨了不同的模型的大小和计算复杂度的平衡。",
