    "translated_abstract": "耦合偏微分方程是描述许多物理过程复杂动态的关键任务。最近，神经算子已经展示出通过在傅里叶/小波空间直接学习积分核来解决PDE的能力。对于耦合PDE的解决方法，难点在于处理函数之间的耦合映射。为此，我们提出了一种耦合多小波神经算子（CMWNO）学习方案，通过在小波空间中进行多小波分解和重构过程中解耦合积分核。在解决Gray-Scott（GS）方程和非局部均场博弈（MFG）问题等耦合PDE方面，所提出的模型相对于先前基于学习的求解器实现了显著提高的准确性。根据我们的实验结果，所提出的模型相对于最先进模型的$L^2$误差表现出了$2\\times \\sim 4\\times$的改进。",
