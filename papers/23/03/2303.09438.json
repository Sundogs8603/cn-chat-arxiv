    "abstract": "Trustera, the first functional system that redacts personally identifiable information (PII) in real-time spoken conversations to remove agents' need to hear sensitive information while preserving the naturalness of live customer-agent conversations. As opposed to post-call redaction, audio masking starts as soon as the customer begins speaking to a PII entity. This significantly reduces the risk of PII being intercepted or stored in insecure data storage. Trustera's architecture consists of a pipeline of automatic speech recognition, natural language understanding, and a live audio redactor module. The system's goal is three-fold: redact entities that are PII, mask the audio that goes to the agent, and at the same time capture the entity, so that the captured PII can be used for a payment transaction or caller identification. Trustera is currently being used by thousands of agents to secure customers' sensitive information.",

    "translated_abstract": "Trustera是第一个实现在实时谈话中屏蔽个人身份信息（PII）以消除代理商需要听到敏感信息的同时保留现场客户-代理商对话自然性的功能系统。与通话后的屏蔽相比，音频屏蔽开始于客户开始与PII实体交谈时。这显着降低了PII被拦截或存储在不安全数据存储中的风险。Trustera的架构由自动语音识别、自然语言理解和实时音频屏蔽模块的管道组成。系统的目标是三重的：屏蔽PII实体、掩盖发送给代理商的音频，同时捕获实体，以便捕获的PII可用于付款交易或来电者识别。Trustera目前正在被数千名代理商使用，以保护客户的敏感信息。",
