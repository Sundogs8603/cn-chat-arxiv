    "translated_abstract": "在线数字助手（如Amazon Alexa，Google Assistant，Apple Siri）非常流行，并为其用户提供了一系列服务。其关键功能是能够满足用户信息需求。然而，虽然这些应用程序通常能够有效回答事实问题，但支持较不具体或探索性的搜索任务的能力却不那么明显。本研究对标准的Amazon Alexa进行了探索性搜索任务的行为分析，并且结果表明其不能有效地满足这些信息需求。我们提出了扩展Alexa的方法，以克服这些不足。我们的定制Alexa应用程序扩展了Alexa的对话功能，以支持探索性搜索，用户研究表明我们的扩展应用程序能够有效地实现探索性搜索。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了在智能音箱中使用对话式探索性搜索的潜力，并使用扩展Alexa的方法克服其短处，实现了探索性搜索。",
