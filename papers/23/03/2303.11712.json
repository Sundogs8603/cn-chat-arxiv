    "translated_abstract": "我们在最近提出的方法基础上，为逐步以易于理解方式解释约束满足问题（CSP）的解决方案。这里的解释是一系列简单的推断步骤，其中简单性使用成本函数量化。解释生成算法依赖于从导出的不可满足公式中提取最小不满子集（MUS），利用所谓的非冗余解释和 MUS 之间的一一对应关系。然而，MUS 提取算法不提供任何针对给定成本函数的子集最小性或最优性保证。因此，我们在这些形式基础上建立，并着手改进的主要要点，即如何高效地生成可证明是最优的解释（与给定成本度量相关）。为此，我们开发了（1）基于命中集的算法，用于查找最佳受限不可满足子集；（2）一种重用相关信息的方法，可在不同的解释生成阶段提高效率。",
