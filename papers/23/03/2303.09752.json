    "abstract": "Many natural language processing tasks benefit from long inputs, but processing long documents with Transformers is expensive -- not only due to quadratic attention complexity but also from applying feedforward and projection layers to every token. However, not all tokens are equally important, especially for longer documents. We propose CoLT5, a long-input Transformer model that builds on this intuition by employing conditional computation, devoting more resources to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers. We show that CoLT5 achieves stronger performance than LongT5 with much faster training and inference, achieving SOTA on the long-input SCROLLS benchmark. Moreover, CoLT5 can effectively and tractably make use of extremely long inputs, showing strong gains up to 64k input length.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多自然语言处理任务需要处理长输入，但使用Transformer处理长文档很昂贵——这不仅是因为二次注意复杂性，还因为对每个标记应用前馈和投影层。然而，不是所有标记都同样重要，特别是对于较长的文档。我们提出了CoLT5，一种长输入Transformer模型，通过使用条件计算来利用此直觉，在前馈和注意层中为重要标记提供更多资源。我们展示了CoLT5比LongT5表现更强，训练和推理速度更快，在长输入SCROLLS基准测试上达到了SOTA。此外，CoLT5能够有效且可控地利用极长的输入，展示了高达64k输入长度的强大增益。",
