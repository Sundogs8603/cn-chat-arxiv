To apply the COS method, one has to specify two parameters: a truncation range for the density of the log-returns and a number of terms N to approximate the truncated density by a cosine series. How to choose the truncation range is already known. Here, we are able to find an explicit and useful bound for N as well. We further show that the COS method has at least an exponential order of convergence if the density is smooth and decays exponentially. But, if the density is smooth and has heavy tails like in the Finite Moment Log Stable model, the COS method has not an exponential order of convergence. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings.",

    "translated_abstract": "Fourier余弦展开（COS）方法用于高效地计算欧式期权价格。要应用COS方法，必须指定两个参数：对数收益率密度的截断范围和用余弦级数逼近截断密度的项数N。如何选择截断范围已经为人所知。在这里，我们还能找到一个明确的并且有用的项数N的界限。我们还进一步表明，如果密度是平滑的并且呈指数衰减，则COS方法至少具有指数收敛阶数。但是，如果密度平滑但有重尾巴，就像在有限矩阵log稳定模型中一样，则COS方法没有指数收敛阶数。数值实验确认了理论发现。",
