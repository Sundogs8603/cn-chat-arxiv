    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，会话搜索引起了相当多的关注。但是，大多数研究都集中在能够支持“单个”搜索者的系统上。在本文中，我们探讨了如何支持通过即时通讯平台（即 Slack）协作的“多个”搜索者的系统。我们展示了一项“奥兹巫师”研究，27对参与者在 Slack 上协作完成了三个信息寻求任务。参与者无法独立搜索，必须通过与从 Slack 通道直接交互的“搜索机器人”收集信息。搜索机器人的角色由参考图书馆员扮演。会话搜索系统必须能够参与“混合倡议”交互，通过控制对话并交还控制权以实现不同的目标。话语分析研究表明，会话代理可以采取两种倡议水平：对话水平和任务水平倡议。代理通过在多个选项中选择打开新的子话题或提示用户进行澄清来采取对话水平倡议。代理通过为该任务提供新的相关信息来采取任务水平倡议。基于我们的分析，我们发现，在与“多个”搜索者进行协作搜索的情况下，搜索机器人采用了更高比例的对话水平倡议。本文提供了有关搜索机器人如何在存在多个搜索者的情况下采取和放弃倡议以响应的见解，这可以为未来的会话搜索系统的设计提供指导。",
