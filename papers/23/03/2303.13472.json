    "translated_abstract": "游戏引擎在计算机图形学中是强大的工具，但是它们的开发成本也是十分巨大的。本文提出了一个框架，可以从单眼注释视频中训练出类似游戏引擎的神经模型。该结果被称为Learnable Game Engine (LGE)，可以维护场景、物体和其中的代理状态，并且可以从可控制的视角渲染环境。类似于游戏引擎，它模拟了游戏的逻辑和底层物理规则，使用户可以通过指定高级和低级操作序列来玩游戏。最引人注目的是，我们的LGE解锁了导演模式，用户通过标注高层次的动作和目标来控制代理。这要求学习“游戏人工智能”，由我们的动画模型封装，以使用高级约束条件导航场景、与对手对战，设计赢得游戏的策略。",
