To fundamentally overcome this limitation, ODIN attempts to mitigate the dataset constraints by generating on-demand datasets based on user requirements. ODIN consists of three main modules: a prompt generator, a text-to-image generator, and an image post-processor. To generate high-quality prompts and images, we adopted a large language model (e.g., ChatGPT), and a text-to-image diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion), respectively. We evaluated ODIN on various datasets in terms of model accuracy and data diversity to demonstrate its potential, and conducted post-experiments for further investigation. Overall, ODIN is a feasible approach that enables Al to learn unseen knowledge beyond the training dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "ODIN是一种创新性的方法，通过整合生成式AI模型来解决数据集约束问题。传统的零样本学习方法受训练数据集的限制较大。为了从根本上克服这一限制，ODIN试图通过根据用户需求生成按需数据集来减轻数据集约束。ODIN由三个主要模块组成：提示生成器、文本到图像生成器和图像后处理器。为了生成高质量的提示和图像，我们采用了大型语言模型（例如ChatGPT）和文本到图像扩散模型（例如Stable Diffusion）。我们在各种数据集上对ODIN进行了模型准确性和数据多样性方面的评估以展示其潜力，并进行了进一步的后处理实验。总的来说，ODIN是一种可行的方法，使人工智能能够学习超出训练数据集的未见知识。",
