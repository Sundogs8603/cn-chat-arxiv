    "abstract": "Transfer learning has been widely utilized to mitigate the data scarcity problem in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conventional transfer learning relies on re-using models trained on AD-irrelevant tasks such as natural image classification. However, it often leads to negative transfer due to the discrepancy between the non-medical source and target medical domains. To address this, we present evidence-empowered transfer learning for AD diagnosis. Unlike conventional approaches, we leverage an AD-relevant auxiliary task, namely morphological change prediction, without requiring additional MRI data. In this auxiliary task, the diagnosis model learns the evidential and transferable knowledge from morphological features in MRI scans. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework is not only effective in improving detection performance regardless of model capacity, but also more data-efficient and faithful.",

    "translated_abstract": "转移学习已经被广泛应用于减轻阿尔茨海默病（AD）领域中的数据匮乏问题。传统的转移学习依赖于重复使用在AD非相关任务（例如自然图像分类）上训练的模型。然而，由于非医学来源和目标医学领域之间的差异，它经常导致负转移。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种证据支持的AD诊断转移学习方法。与传统方法不同的是，我们利用AD相关的辅助任务，即形态变化预测，而无需额外的MRI数据。在这个辅助任务中，诊断模型学习来自MRI扫描中形态学特征的证据和可转移知识。实验结果表明，我们的框架不仅可以提高检测性能，而且无论模型容量如何，也更具有数据效率和可信度。",
