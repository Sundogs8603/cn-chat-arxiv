We demonstrate Deep Augmentation through extensive experiments on contrastive learning tasks in NLP, computer vision, and graph learning. We observe substantial performance gains with Transformers, ResNets, and Graph Neural Networks as the underlying models in contrastive learning, but observe inverse effects on the corresponding supervised problems. Our analysis suggests that Deep Augmentation alleviates co-adaption between layers, a form of \"collapse.\" We use this observation to formulate a method for selecting which layer to target; in particular, our experimentation reveals that targeting deeper layers with Deep Augmentation outperforms augmenting the input data.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种称为深度增强的方法，通过使用辍学或PCA来转换神经网络中的目标层，以提高性能和泛化能力。我们通过在自然语言处理、计算机视觉和图学习中的对比学习任务上进行大量实验来展示深度增强。 我们观察到在对比学习的基础模型中，如Transformers、ResNets和图神经网络上深度增强能够带来显著的性能提升，但在相应的监督问题上观察到相反的效果。 我们的分析表明，深度增强减轻了层之间的相互适应，即\"崩溃\"形式的问题。 我们利用这一观察结果制定了一种选择目标层的方法；特别是，我们的实验表明，用深度增强定位更深层次的层要优于增强输入数据。 这种方法的简单网络和模态无关性使其",
