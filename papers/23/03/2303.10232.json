    "en_tdlr": "A novel LSwinSR super-resolution algorithm based on the state-of-the-art Swin Transformer is proposed for UAV image super-resolution. A more comprehensive evaluation metric, the F1-score, is introduced to better reflect outline recovery performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LSwinSR outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms."
