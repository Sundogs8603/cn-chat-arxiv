A multi-network combined text-to-building facade image generating method is proposed in this work.

    "translated_abstract": "稳定扩散模型已广泛应用于建筑图像生成的研究中，但目前仍有提高生成图像内容可控性的机会。本文提出了一种多网络结合的文本到建筑立面图像生成方法。我们首先通过 LoRA（低秩自适应）方法在 CMP Fa-cades 数据集上对稳定扩散模型进行了微调，然后应用 ControlNet 模型进一步控制输出。最后，我们对不同建筑风格文本内容和控制策略下的立面生成结果进行了对比。结果表明，LoRA 训练方法显着降低了微调稳定扩散大模型的可能性，而 ControlNet 模型的添加增加了文本到建筑立面图像的可控性。这为后续关于建筑图像生成的研究提供了基础。",
