    "translated_abstract": "Hamilton-Jacobi 偏微分方程(HJ PDEs)与广泛领域，如最优控制、微分游戏和成像科学有着深刻的联系。通过将时间变量视为更高维的量，HJ PDEs 可以扩展到多时间的情况。本文在特定机器学习优化问题与多时间Hopf公式之间建立了一种新的理论联系，该公式对应于某些多时间 HJ PDEs 的解的表示。通过这种联系，我们通过展示当我们解决这些学习问题时，我们也解决了一个多时间 HJ PDE 和相应的最优控制问题，从而增加了某些机器学习应用程序的训练过程的可解释性。作为这种联系的第一个探索，我们发展了正则化线性回归问题与线性二次调节器 (LQR) 之间的关系。然后，我们利用我们的理论框架设计了一种新的深度神经网络训练算法，实现了改进的泛化性能。",

A deep neural network training algorithm is then developed based on this theoretical framework, achieving improved generalization performance."
