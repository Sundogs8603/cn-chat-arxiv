    "abstract": "Temporal and numerical expression understanding is of great importance in many downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) tasks. However, much previous work covers only a few sub-types and focuses only on entity extraction, which severely limits the usability of identified mentions. In order for such entities to be useful in downstream scenarios, coverage and granularity of sub-types are important; and, even more so, providing resolution into concrete values that can be manipulated. Furthermore, most previous work addresses only a handful of languages. Here we describe a multi-lingual evaluation dataset - NTX - covering diverse temporal and numerical expressions across 14 languages and covering extraction, normalization, and resolution. Along with the dataset we provide a robust rule-based system as a strong baseline for comparisons against other models to be evaluated in this dataset. Data and code are available at \\url{https://aka.ms/NTX}.",

    "translated_abstract": "在许多自然语言处理和信息检索任务中，时间和数字表达式的理解非常重要。然而，大多数以前的工作仅涵盖了少量的子类型，并且只关注实体抽取，这严重限制了识别到的提及的可用性。为了在下游场景中使用这些实体，子类型的覆盖范围和粒度很重要；并且更加重要的是，提供可以操作的具体值解析。此外，大多数先前的工作仅处理几种语言。在这里，我们描述了一个多语言评估数据集-NTX-涵盖了14种语言的各种时间和数字表达式，并覆盖了提取，规范化和解析。除了数据集之外，我们还提供了一个强大的基于规则的系统作为与在该数据集中评估其他模型的比较的强大基准。数据和代码可在 \\url{https://aka.ms/NTX}上获得。",
