    "translated_abstract": "类比推理是人类思维的一种非凡能力，并且已被用来解决难以理解的任务。 基于类比的推理（AR）受到了人工智能社区的越来越多的关注，并在多个机器学习任务中表现出其潜力，例如分类，决策和具有竞争性结果的推荐。 我们提出了一个基于深度学习（DL）的框架来解决AR中的两个关键任务：类比检测和解决。该框架在整个Siganalogies数据集上进行了全面测试，该数据集包含单词之间的形态学类比比例（APs），并且在许多语言中显示出优于符号方法的表现。 之前的工作已经探索了分类问题上的类比神经网络行为（ANNc）和检索问题上的类比神经网络行为（ANNr），以及自编码器（AE）在生成解决方案单词上的潜力。 在本文中，我们通过提出一个基于条件变分自编码器（CVAE）的统一框架来总结并扩展以前的工作，该框架可以共同解决两个任务。我们提出的框架可以生成在数据集中以前不存在的类比。",
