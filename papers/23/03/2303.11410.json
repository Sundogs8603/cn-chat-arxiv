    "translated_abstract": "变分自编码器（VAE）神经网络可以被训练以生成捕捉历史数据边际分布和多元依赖性的电力系统状态。VAE的潜变量空间的坐标已被证明与数据的概念特征相关，这可以利用来合成具有所需特征的定向数据。然而，VAE的潜变量空间代码对应特定属性的位置并不受限制。此外，生成具有特定特征的数据可能需要将具有对应难以获得标签的数据馈入生成模型进行训练。为了使数据生成更具可控性和效率，本文提出了一种定向变分自编码器（OVAE），以Spearman相关性的形式约束潜变量空间代码与生成数据之间的链接，这为数据合成过程提供了更精细的控制。在此基础上，提出了一种重要性采样过程，以针对电力系统中特定的高风险状态。 OVAE被证明能够生成与所需高风险状态对齐的具有定向特征的合成数据，从而实现对电力系统中关键事件的更有效预测和缓解。",
