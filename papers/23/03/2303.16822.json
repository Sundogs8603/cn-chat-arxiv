    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一类DC复合优化问题。这类问题通常由低秩矩阵恢复的鲁棒分解模型推导而来，是凸复合优化问题和具有非光滑分量的DC规划的扩展。针对这类非凸和非光滑问题，我们提出了一种非精确线性化近端算法（iLPA）。算法中，我们利用目标函数的部分线性化，计算强凸主导的非精确最小化值。迭代序列的生成收敛于潜在函数的Kurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz（KL）性质，如果潜在函数在极限点处具有KL指数$1/2$的KL性质，则收敛具有局部R线性速率。对于后一种假设，我们利用复合结构提供了一个可验证的条件，并阐明了与凸复合优化所使用的正则性的关系。最后，我们将所提出的非精确线性近端算法应用于解决鲁棒分解中的两个重要问题：张量鲁棒主成分分析（TRPCA）和张量鲁棒低秩张量完成（TRLRTC）。对合成和真实数据的数值结果证明了我们的算法相对于现有最新算法的有效性。",
