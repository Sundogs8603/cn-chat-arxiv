    "translated_abstract": "沉浸感在设计电影时扮演着至关重要的角色，然而，沉浸式拍摄的困难阻碍了设计师创造出令人满意的成果。在本文中，我们分析了构成电影沉浸感的具体组成部分，考虑了空间、情感和美学等方面，同时这些组成部分被结合到了一个高级评估机制中。在这样的沉浸机制的指导下，我们提出了一种基于GAN的摄像机控制系统，能够在3D虚拟环境中生成基于演员驱动的摄像机移动，以获得沉浸式电影序列。生成过程中提出的编码器-解码器架构将演员运动转换为以情感因素为条件的摄像机轨迹，确保了演员与摄像机的物理和心理同步以实现空间和情感的沉浸感。通过加入控制摄像机抖动以表达不同心理状态的正则化，情感沉浸感得到了进一步加强。",
