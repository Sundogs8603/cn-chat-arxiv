    "abstract": "In-betweening is a technique for generating transitions given initial and target character states. The majority of existing works require multiple (often $>$10) frames as input, which are not always accessible. Our work deals with a focused yet challenging problem: to generate the transition when given exactly two frames (only the first and last). To cope with this challenging scenario, we implement our bi-directional scheme which generates forward and backward transitions from the start and end frames with two adversarial autoregressive networks, and stitches them in the middle of the transition where there is no strict ground truth. The autoregressive networks based on conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE) are optimized by searching for a pair of optimal latent codes that minimize a novel stitching loss between their outputs. Results show that our method achieves higher motion quality and more diverse results than existing methods on both the LaFAN1 and Human3.6m datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "中间帧生成是一种根据初始和目标角色状态生成转换的技术。现有的大多数作品需要多个（通常>10）帧作为输入，这些帧并不总是可访问的。我们的工作处理的是一个聚焦但具有挑战性的问题：当只有第一帧和最后一帧时生成过渡。为了应对这种具有挑战性的情况，我们实现了双向方案，该方案使用两个对抗的自回归网络从起始和终止帧生成前向和后向过渡，并将它们在过渡的中间位置（即没有严格的实地真相）进行拼接。基于条件变分自动编码器（CVAE）的自回归网络是通过寻找一对优化的潜在代码，使它们的输出之间的新型拼接损失最小化来优化的。结果表明，我们的方法在LaFAN1和Human3.6m数据集上实现了比现有方法更高的运动质量和更多样化的结果。",
