    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型在预测结构化文本（如代码）方面表现出色，但是它们通常会在其输出中引入错误和虚假信息。当用于辅助软件开发人员时，这些模型可能会犯错，需要用户返回更正，或更糟糕的是，可能会引入用户可能会完全忽略的微妙的错误。我们提出了一种名为R-U-SURE的方法，它基于决策论模型，利用来自生成模型的随机样本作为最终用户未观察到的可能意图的代理，构建考虑不确定性的建议。我们的技术结合了最小贝叶斯风险解码、双重分解和决策图，以便仅通过对任意代码生成模型的样本访问和可选的AST解析器，高效地生成结构化不确定性摘要。我们在三个开发者辅助任务上展示了R-U-SURE，并显示它可以适用于不同的用户。",
