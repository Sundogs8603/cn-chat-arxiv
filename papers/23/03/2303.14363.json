We design new heuristic search algorithms MOLAO* and MOLRTDP, which extend well-known SSP algorithms to the multi-objective case.

    "translated_abstract": "启发式搜索是一种强大的方法，已成功应用于广泛的规划问题，包括经典规划，多目标规划和概率规划，它被建模为随机最短路径（SSP）问题。本文将启发式搜索扩展到更具表达力的问题类，即多目标随机最短路径（MOSSP），其中需要计算非支配策略的覆盖集。我们设计了新的启发式搜索算法MOLAO*和MOLRTDP，将众所周知的SSP算法扩展到多目标情况。我们进一步构建了一系列与领域无关的启发式函数，它们在考虑问题的随机和多目标特性时具有不同的能力来指导搜索。我们的实验证明了这些算法的优点和启发式函数的相对优点。",
