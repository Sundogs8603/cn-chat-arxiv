    "abstract": "Deep learning has proven to be successful in various domains and for different tasks. However, when it comes to private data several restrictions are making it difficult to use deep learning approaches in these application fields. Recent approaches try to generate data privately instead of applying a privacy-preserving mechanism directly, on top of the classifier. The solution is to create public data from private data in a manner that preserves the privacy of the data. In this work, two very prominent GAN-based architectures were evaluated in the context of private time series classification. In contrast to previous work, mostly limited to the image domain, the scope of this benchmark was the time series domain. The experiments show that especially GSWGAN performs well across a variety of public datasets outperforming the competitor DPWGAN. An analysis of the generated datasets further validates the superiority of GSWGAN in the context of time series generation.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习已被证明在各个领域和任务中都很成功。然而，当涉及到私人数据时，几个限制使得难以在这些应用领域中使用深度学习方法。最近的方法尝试私密地生成数据，而不是在分类器之上直接应用隐私保护机制。解决方案是以一种保护数据隐私的方式从私有数据创建公共数据。在这项工作中，针对私有时间序列分类情境，评估了两种非常突出的基于GAN的架构。与先前主要局限于图像领域的工作相比，这个基准测试的范围是时间序列领域。实验表明，尤其是GSWGAN在多种公共数据集上表现良好，优于竞争对手DPWGAN。生成数据集的分析进一步验证了GSWGAN在时间序列生成的情境下的优越性。",
