    "abstract": "Introduction: Traditional Korean medicine (TKM) emphasizes individualized diagnosis and treatment, making AI modeling difficult due to limited data and implicit processes. GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, large language models, have shown impressive medical knowledge despite lacking medicine-specific training. This study aimed to assess the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for TKM using the Korean National Licensing Examination for Korean Medicine Doctors. Methods: GPT-3.5 (February 2023) and GPT-4 (March 2023) models answered 340 questions from the 2022 examination across 12 subjects. Each question was independently evaluated five times in an initialized session. Results: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 achieved 42.06% and 57.29% accuracy, respectively, with GPT-4 nearing passing performance. There were significant differences in accuracy by subjects, with 83.75% accuracy for neuropsychiatry compared to 28.75% for internal medicine (2). Both models showed high accuracy in recall-based and diagnosis-based questi",
