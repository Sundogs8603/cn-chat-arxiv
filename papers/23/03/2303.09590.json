    "translated_abstract": "多变量网络在真实世界的数据驱动应用中经常被发现。发掘和理解多变量网络中的关系并不是一项简单的任务。本文提出了一种用于研究多变量网络以提取网络不同结构和语义特征之间关联的视觉分析工作流程（例如，什么是在社交网络密度方面与不同属性的组合关系）。该工作流程包括基于神经网络的学习阶段，根据所选输入和输出属性来对数据进行分类，降维和优化阶段以产生一个简化的结果集合以便检查，最后通过用户交互式可视化接口进行解释阶段的操作。我们设计的一个关键部分是组合变量构建步骤，该步骤将由神经网络获得的非线性特征重塑为直观解释的线性特征。我们通过对大型组织员工之间的电子邮件通信数据集进行案例研究，证明了工作流程的有效性和可理解性。",

The key composite variable construction step remolds nonlinear features into linear ones for ease of interpretation. The effectiveness and understandability of the workflow are demonstrated through a case study analyzing email communication data between employees in a large organization."
