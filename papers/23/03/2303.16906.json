    "abstract": "Concept drift detection has attracted considerable attention due to its importance in many real-world applications such as health monitoring and fault diagnosis. Conventionally, most advanced approaches will be of poor performance when the evaluation criteria of the environment has changed (i.e. concept drift), either can only detect and adapt to virtual drift. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect real-drift in the chunk data stream with limited annotations based on concept confusion. When a new data chunk arrives, we use both real labels and pseudo labels to update the model after prediction and drift detection. In this context, the model will be confused and yields prediction difference once drift occurs. We then adopt cosine similarity to measure the difference. And an adaptive threshold method is proposed to find the abnormal value. Experiments show that our method has a low false alarm rate and false negative rate with the utilization of different classifiers.",

    "translated_abstract": "概念漂移检测因其在健康监控和故障诊断等许多实际应用中的重要性而受到广泛关注。然而，传统的漂移检测方法在环境评估标准发生变化（即概念漂移）时往往表现不佳。本文提出了一种基于概念混淆的有限注释块数据流实时漂移检测新方法。当新的数据块到达时，我们使用真实标签和伪标签在预测和漂移检测后更新模型。在这种情况下，模型一旦发生漂移就会产生预测差异。我们使用余弦相似度来度量差异，并提出一种自适应阈值方法来找到异常值。实验证明，该方法在利用不同分类器时具有较低的误报率和漏报率。",
