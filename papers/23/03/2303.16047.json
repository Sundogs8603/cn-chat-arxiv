    "translated_abstract": "在实际应用中，机器学习模型与领域专家之间的交互至关重要；然而，通常只生成单个模型的经典机器学习范式不利于此类交互。近似和探索Rashomon集，即所有近乎最优模型的集合，通过提供用户可搜索的空间包含多样性模型的方法，解决了这一实际挑战，领域专家可以从中选择。我们提出了一种有效而准确地近似稀疏广义可加模型（GAMs）的Rashomon集的技术。我们提供了用于近似具有固定支持集的GAMs的Rashomon集的椭球形算法，并使用这些椭球形近似了许多不同支持集的Rashomon集。近似的Rashomon集为解决实际挑战，例如（1）研究模型类的变量重要性；（2）在用户指定约束条件下查找模型，提供了重要的基础。",
