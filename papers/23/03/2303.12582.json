To address this issue, we present AfroDigits, a minimalist, community-driven dataset of spoken digits for African languages, currently covering 38 African languages. As a demonstration of the practical applications of AfroDigits, we conduct audio digit classification experiments on six African languages [Igbo (ibo), Yoruba (yor), Rundi (run), Oshiwambo (kua), Shona (sna), and Oromo (gax)] using the Wav2Vec2.0-Large and XLS-R models. Our experiments reveal a useful insight on the effect of mixing African speech corpora during finetuning. AfroDigits is the first published audio digit dataset for African languages and we believe it will, among other things, pave the way for Afro-centric speech applications such as the recognition of telephone numbers, and street numbers.

    "translated_abstract": "计算机语音技术的进步是显著的，但由于非洲语料库的匮乏，其在非洲语言中的集成仍然有限。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了AfroDigits，这是一个极简的、由社区驱动的非洲语言口语数字数据集，目前覆盖了38种非洲语言。作为AfroDigits实际应用的演示，我们使用Wav2Vec2.0-Large和XLS-R模型，在六种非洲语言[Igbo(ibo), Yoruba(yor), Rundi(run), Oshiwambo(kua), Shona(sna)和Oromo(gax)]上进行了音频数字分类实验。我们的实验揭示了混合非洲语料库在微调过程中的效果。AfroDigits是非洲语言中第一个发布的音频数字数据集，我们相信它将为面向非洲的语音应用程序开辟道路，如电话号码和街道地址的识别。我们在https:/ / afrodigits公开发布数据集和平台。",
