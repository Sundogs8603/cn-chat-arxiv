    "translated_abstract": "移民总是被指责窃取人们的工作。然而，在劳动力市场的新古典模型中，每个人都有工作可做，也没有工作可被窃取（没有失业，因此想工作的人都可以工作）。在标准匹配模型中，存在一些失业，但由于劳动力需求完全弹性，因此新进入劳动力市场的人被吸收时不会影响求职者的前景。再次说明，当移民到达时没有工作会被窃取。本文显示，在一个具有就业配给的匹配模型中，移民的进入会降低本地工人的就业率。此外，当劳动力市场不景气时，就业率的降幅更大，因为那时工作更加稀缺。因为移民降低了劳动力市场的紧张程度，使得公司更容易招聘，并改善公司利润。移民对本地福利的总体影响取决于劳动力市场的状态。当劳动力市场出现衰退时总体影响始终是负面的，并且当劳动力市场繁荣时可能是正面的。",
