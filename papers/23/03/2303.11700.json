    "translated_abstract": "个性化推荐系统已被广泛研究和部署，以减少信息过载并满足用户的多样化需求。然而，传统的推荐模型仅进行一次训练-测试，无法适应不断变化的需求，考虑到用户偏好转移和现实世界中不断增长的用户和项目。针对这些挑战，提出了流式推荐，并在学术界和产业界引起了极大关注。在这些方法中，连续图学习被广泛认为是流式推荐的一种有前途的方法。然而，现有方法要么依赖于历史数据的回放，而这在日益严格的数据监管下通常不可行，要么很少能解决过稳定性问题。为了克服这些困难，从“模型隔离”的角度提出了一种新的动态可扩展图卷积（DEGC）算法用于流式推荐。具体而言，DEGC将演变的图形建模为一系列图形快照，并通过从新图形快照中交互地添加新节点和边缘来自适应地扩展每个图形卷积层的接收字段。此外，DEGC引入了一种双通道训练策略，利用历史和当前图形快照的内在“刚度”和“互补性”，分别进行训练。在两个大规模真实世界数据集上进行的大量实验表明，DEGC在推荐准确性和模型稳定性方面优于现有的竞争方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a dynamically expandable graph convolution model for streaming recommendation, which introduces a dual-channel training strategy and adaptively expands the receptive field of each graph convolutional layer by interactively adding new nodes and edges from the new graph snapshot. The authors' method performs better than competing methods."
