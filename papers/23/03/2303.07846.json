    "translated_abstract": "模仿学习即通过演示进行学习，已经被研究并应用于序贯决策任务中，在这类任务中，奖励函数并不是预定义的。然而，模仿学习方法仍需要大量的专家演示样本才能成功模仿专家的行为。为提高样本效率，我们利用自监督表示学习，该方法可以从给定的数据生成大量的训练信号。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于自监督表示的对抗性模仿学习方法，以学习不受各种扭曲影响的状态和动作表示，并建立非图像控制任务的预测表征。特别是，与现有的表格数据自监督学习方法相比，我们提出了一种针对状态和动作表示的不同损坏方法，以使其能够抵抗各种扭曲。理论和实证观察表明，使一个信息量大的特征流形与一个简单的生成器与一个复杂的分类器协同工作能够提高状态表征的质量。",
