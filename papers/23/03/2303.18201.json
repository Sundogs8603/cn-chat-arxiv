    "translated_title": "TPMCF: 使用多源协同特征进行时间QoS预测",
    "translated_abstract": "最近，随着服务API的快速部署，个性化的服务推荐在电子商务行业的增长中发挥了至关重要的作用。决定服务性能的服务质量(QoS)参数经常被用于推荐，但随时间波动。因此，QoS的预测对于在等价服务中识别合适的服务至关重要。当代的时间QoS预测方法由于各种限制而很难达到期望的精度，例如无法处理数据稀疏和异常值以及捕获用户-服务交互之间的高阶时间关系。虽然最近一些基于循环神经网络的体系结构可以建模QoS数据之间的时间关系，但由于缺乏其他特征（例如协作特征）来理解用户-服务交互之间的关系，预测精度会降低。本文通过提出一种解决方案TPMCF，来解决上述挑战。TPMCF利用多源特征（包括时间、用户和服务特征）进行QoS预测。具体地，它使用一个带有注意机制的新颖编码器解码器架构来利用用户-服务交互之间的高阶时间关系。此外，它使用协作特征来捕捉用户和服务之间的关系，并处理数据稀疏和异常值。对实际数据集进行的大量实验证明了TPMCF的有效性和优越性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new method called TPMCF, which uses multi-source features for QoS prediction. The method leverages a novel encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms to model higher-order temporal relationships among user-service interactions, and utilizes collaborative features to capture the relationship among users and services, effectively handling data sparsity and outliers. Large-scale experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of TPMCF over state-of-the-art methods."
