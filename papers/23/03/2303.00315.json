    "translated_abstract": "对话式情境马尔可夫决策过程通过偶尔询问显式反馈中的关键词来加快学习过程。然而，现有方法存在一些局限性。首先，关于关键词层面的对话和臂级推荐的信息没有被妥善地结合起来以加速学习。其次，重要的是问一些探索性的关键词，以迅速了解用户在各个领域的潜在兴趣，从而加速用户偏好估计的收敛速度，而这在现有研究中从未被考虑过。为了解决这些问题，我们首先提出了“ConLinUCB”这一对话式决策过程的通用框架，它能够更好地将关键词层面和臂级反馈结合起来，在每个时间步骤上一步估计用户偏好。基于这个框架，我们进一步设计了两种带有探索性关键词选择策略的决策过程算法，即ConLinUCB-BS和ConLinUCB-MCR。",
