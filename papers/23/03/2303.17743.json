    "translated_abstract": "在过去的几十年中，人们致力于在各种领域中生成逼真的图形，从社交网络到计算机网络，从基因调控网络到在线交易网络。尽管这些工作取得了显著的成功，但绝大多数工作都没有监督性质，通常是在训练时最小化预期的图形重构损失，这可能导致在生成的图形中出现表示偏差问题，即受保护的群体(通常是少数群体)对目标贡献更少，因此会遭受系统性更高的误差。本文旨在通过利用标签信息和用户首选的平等约束，将图生成调整为下游挖掘任务。特别地，在探究图生成模型中的表示偏差的背景下，我们提出了一个名为FairGen的公平感知图生成模型，以减轻这种偏差。我们的模型联合了标签损失和公平损失，并通过雅可比优化方法进行训练，以得到公平性，同时保持逼真性。",
