    "translated_abstract": "常规的物理学指导的神经网络（PINN）利用稀疏标记数据预测偏微分方程的解，但只限于单一的域。相反，完全监督学习模型通常是首先在已知解（即标记数据）的几千个域上进行训练，然后预测在一些未知域上的解。物理学指导的PointNet（PIPN）主要旨在填补PINN（作为弱监督学习模型）和完全监督学习模型之间的差距。在本文中，我们展示了PIPN能够同时预测所需偏微分方程在数百个域上的解，而只使用稀疏标记数据。这个框架有助于在工业界进行快速的几何设计，尤其当只有稀疏标记数据可用时。特别地，我们展示了PIPN能够同时预测平面应力问题在500多个不同几何体上的解。",
