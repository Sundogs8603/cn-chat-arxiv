    "translated_abstract": "精确、快速的急性缺血性卒中（AIS）患者缺血区（核心和半影区）预测方法对于改进诊断和治疗规划具有重要的临床意义。计算机断层扫描（CT）是疑似AIS患者早期评估的主要模式之一。CT灌注成像（CTP）通常用作主要评估手段，以确定卒中位置、严重程度和缺血性病灶体积。目前，大多数CTP自动分割方法都使用已经处理过的三维彩色地图作为放射科医师常规视觉评估的输入。或者，基于切片的二维+时间输入使用原始CTP数据，其中忽略了在体积上的空间信息。在本文中，我们研究不同方法来利用整个四维CTP作为输入，以充分利用时空信息。这使我们提出了一种新颖的4D卷积层。我们在大型数据集上进行的全面实验表明，所提出的方法明显优于现有的最先进方法。该方法有潜力为改善AIS患者的早期诊断和治疗规划的准确性和效率做出贡献。",
