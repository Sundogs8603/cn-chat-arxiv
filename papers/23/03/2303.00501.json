    "translated_abstract": "自动化机器学习 (AutoML) 旨在以最少人力投入构建机器学习模型。虽然在AutoML领域进行了大量研究，以便在构建人工智能 (AI) 应用程序时将人类排除在外，但鲜有文献关注AutoML如何在开放环境场景中工作，例如训练和更新大型模型、工业供应链或工业虚拟世界。在这些场景中，人们在搜索过程中经常面临开放环路问题：他们必须不断收集数据、更新数据和模型、满足开发和部署环境的要求、支持大规模设备、修改评估指标等。使用纯数据驱动方法解决开放环境问题需要大量数据、计算资源和来自专职数据工程师的努力，使得当前的AutoML系统和平台低效且计算复杂。人机交互技术是解决这个问题的关键。",
