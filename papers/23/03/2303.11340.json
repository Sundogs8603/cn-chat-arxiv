    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a worldwide concern, and early detection can help to prevent serious complications. Low-cost, non-invasive detection methods, which take cardiovascular signals into deep learning models, have emerged. However, limited accuracy constrains their clinical usage. In this paper, we present a new Transformer-based architecture, Higher Dimensional Transformer (HDformer), which takes long-range photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to detect diabetes. The long-range PPG contains broader and deeper signal contextual information compared to the less-than-one-minute PPG signals commonly utilized in existing research. To increase the capability and efficiency of processing the long range data, we propose a new attention module Time Square Attention (TSA), reducing the volume of the tokens by more than 10x, while retaining the local/global dependencies. It converts the 1-dimensional inputs into 2-dimensional representations and groups adjacent points into a single 2D token, using ",

    "translated_abstract": "糖尿病是全球性问题，早期检测有助于预防严重并发症。已出现将心血管信号纳入深度学习模型的低成本、非侵入式检测方法，但限制其临床应用的是有限的准确性。本文提出了一种新的基于Transformer的架构，即Higher Dimensional Transformer（HDformer），它利用长距离光电容积图（PPG）信号来检测糖尿病。相较于现有研究常用的不足一分钟的PPG信号，长距离PPG包含更广泛、更深入的信号上下文信息。为了增加处理长距离数据的能力和效率，我们提出了一种新的注意力模块Time Square Attention（TSA），将标记体积减少10倍以上，同时保留本地/全局依赖关系。它将一维输入 转换为二维表示，并将相邻点组成一个单独的2D标记。",
