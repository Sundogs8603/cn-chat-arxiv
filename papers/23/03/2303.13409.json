    "abstract": "We consider a sequential search environment in which the searching agent does not observe the quality of goods. The agent can contract with a profit-maximizing principal who sells a signal about a good's quality but cannot commit to future contracts. The agent is willing to pay a high price for a more informative signal today, but an agent who anticipates high prices in the future is less likely to continue searching due to a low continuation value, thereby reducing the principal's future profits. We show that there is an essentially unique stationary equilibrium in which the principal (i) induces the socially efficient stopping rule, (ii) fully extracts the surplus generated from search, and (iii) persuades the agent against settling for marginal quality goods, thus extending the duration of rent extraction. Our results demonstrate that the principal would not gain from long-term commitment power or considering complicated, non-stationary contracts.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了一种序贯搜索环境，其中搜索代理无法观察到商品的质量。代理可以与以利润最大化为目标的委托人订立合同，委托人出售货物质量的信号，但不能对未来的合同作出承诺。代理人愿意为更具信息量的信号支付更高的价格，但预期未来价格高的代理人由于低的继续价值，更不可能继续搜索，从而减少了委托人未来的利润。我们展示了基本上唯一的稳定均衡，其中委托人(i)引导社会有效的停止规则，(ii)充分提取搜索产生的剩余，并且(iii)说服代理人不要满足于边际质量的货物，从而延长租金提取的时间。我们的结果表明，委托人不会从长期承诺能力或考虑复杂的非稳态合同中获益。",
