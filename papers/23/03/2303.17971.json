    "abstract": "In many real world situations, like minor traffic offenses in big cities, a central authority is tasked with periodic administering punishments to a large number of individuals. Common practice is to give each individual a chance to suffer a smaller fine and be guaranteed to avoid the legal process with probable considerably larger punishment. However, thanks to the large number of offenders and a limited capacity of the central authority, the individual risk is typically small and a rational individual will not choose to pay the fine. Here we show that if the central authority processes the offenders in a publicly known order, it properly incentives the offenders to pay the fine. We show analytically and on realistic experiments that our mechanism promotes non-cooperation and incentives individuals to pay. Moreover, the same holds for an arbitrary coalition. We quantify the expected total payment the central authority receives, and show it increases considerably.",

    "translated_abstract": "在很多现实情况下，例如大城市中的小交通违规事件，中央管理部门需要定期对大量个人进行惩罚。通常的做法是给每个个人一个机会，承担一小笔罚款，并保证免除可能会面临的较大处罚和法律程序。然而，由于违法者数量众多，中央管理部门能力有限，个人面临的风险通常很小，理性的个人将选择不支付罚款。本文展示了，如果中央管理部门按照已知的公开顺序处理违法者，就能适当地激励违法者支付罚款。我们在实验和理论分析中显示，我们的机制促进了非合作行为，激励个人支付罚款。而且，对于任意联盟也是适用的。我们量化了中央管理部门收到的预期总付款，并显示其显著增加。",
