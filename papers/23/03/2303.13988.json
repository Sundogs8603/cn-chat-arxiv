    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）是将人工智能系统与人类交流和日常生活紧密结合的先锋。由于快速技术进步和其极高的通用性，现今LLM已经拥有数百万用户，并正处于成为主要信息检索、内容生成、问题解决等技术的前沿。因此，对其进行全面评估和审查显得尤为重要。由于当前LLM中出现愈加复杂和新颖的行为模式，可将其视为参与人类心理实验的对象，以便更为全面地评估其能力。为此，本文引入了一个名为\"机器心理学\"的新兴研究领域。本文概述了各类心理学分支如何为LLM的行为测试提供有用参考。同时，本文规范了机器心理学研究的方法论标准，特别是专注于提示设计政策的制定。此外，它还描述了行为测试结果如何为未来的LLM发展提供指导。",
