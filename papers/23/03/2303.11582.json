    "translated_abstract": "标准的贝叶斯算法假定持续重新分配测量工作，这在实现过程中存在延迟反馈和基础设施/组织难题等挑战。本文针对仅有少数重新分配阶段的实际情况，其中测量结果是以批处理形式测量的，提出了一种新的适应性实验框架，可灵活处理任何批处理大小。我们的主要观察是，在统计推断中普遍使用的正态近似也可以指导可扩展自适应设计。通过推导渐进顺序实验，我们制定了一种动态规划，可以利用平均回报的先验信息。动态规划的状态转移相对于采样分配是可微的，允许使用基于梯度的方法进行规划和策略优化。我们提出了一种简单的迭代规划方法，即残余时限优化，通过优化平衡探索和利用的规划目标来选择采样分配。在合成和真实世界基准测试问题上的实验结果表明，我们的框架实现了最先进的性能，同时具有模块化和易用性。",
