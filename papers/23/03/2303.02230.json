We use a multi-task object segmenter approach to learn the building footprint and height in the same framework in parallel: (1) we determine the surface area is covered by any buildings (the square footage of occupied land); (2) we determine floorspace from multi-image representations of buildings from various angles to determine the height of buildings. We use Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite images as our main data source. The benefits of these data are their large cross-sectional and longitudinal scope plus their unrestricted accessibility.
