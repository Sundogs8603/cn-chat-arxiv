    "abstract": "Meetings are increasingly important for collaborations. Action items in meeting transcripts are crucial for managing post-meeting to-do tasks, which usually are summarized laboriously. The Action Item Detection task aims to automatically detect meeting content associated with action items. However, datasets manually annotated with action item detection labels are scarce and in small scale. We construct and release the first Chinese meeting corpus with manual action item annotations. In addition, we propose a Context-Drop approach to utilize both local and global contexts by contrastive learning, and achieve better accuracy and robustness for action item detection. We also propose a Lightweight Model Ensemble method to exploit different pre-trained models. Experimental results on our Chinese meeting corpus and the English AMI corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "会议对于协作越来越重要。会议内容中的行动项对于管理会后任务至关重要，而这通常需要耗费大量时间进行总结。行动项检测任务旨在自动检测与行动项相关的会议内容。然而，用于手动注释行动项检测标签的数据集很少且规模较小。我们构建并发布了第一个带有手动行动项注释的中文会议语料库。此外，我们提出了一种上下文丢失方法，通过对比学习利用局部和全局上下文，并实现了更好的行动项检测准确性和鲁棒性。我们还提出了一个轻量级模型集成方法来利用不同的预训练模型。我们在我们的中文会议语料库和英语AMI语料库上的实验结果表明了所提出方法的有效性。",
