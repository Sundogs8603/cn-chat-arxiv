We provide a complete analytic description of the transition between these two regimes. When only a single relaxation eigenmode is present, a suitable choice of the symmetry of the initial conditions gives a localizing decay to equilibrium. In this case, the deviation from equilibrium concentrates at the edges of the box where the rejection probability is maximal.

    "translated_abstract": "我们对一个简单蒙特卡罗算法的弛豫本征模式进行了分析，该算法对应于一个在盒子中移动的粒子，其通过均匀随机跳跃进行运动。盒子外的跳跃被拒绝。长时间后，系统接近平衡概率密度，在盒子内部是均匀的。我们表明，这种平衡状态下的弛豫是不寻常的：对于跳跃长度与盒子大小相当的情况，弛豫本征模式的数量可能非常少，为一或两个。我们提供了完整的分析性描述，来描述两种情况之间的转变。当只存在单个弛豫本征模式时，初始条件的对称性的合适选择使得向平衡状态的局部化衰减。在这种情况下，偏离平衡的集中到盒子边缘，这里拒绝概率最大。最后，除了主方程的松弛分析外，我们还描述了主方程的完整本征谱。",
