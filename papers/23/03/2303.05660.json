    "translated_abstract": "交通量是交通管理和控制提供细粒度信息不可或缺的因素。然而，由于交通传感器的有限部署，获取全面的交通量信息并不容易。现有研究主要集中在提高特定方法的整体估计准确性上，忽略了交通量估计的基本挑战，因此在一些关键任务上表现较差。本文研究了交通量估计中的两个关键问题: (1) 由未检测到的行动引起的不确定交通流，以及 (2) 由拥堵传播引起的非平衡交通流。我们提出了一种基于图形的深度学习方法，可以提供数据驱动的、无模型的和相关自适应方法来解决上述问题，并进行准确的全面交通量估计。特别地，为了量化交通速度和流量之间的动态和非线性关系，本文介绍了用于建立交通流图的相关图卷积网络。",
