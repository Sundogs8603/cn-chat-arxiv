    "abstract": "This paper presents the behavioral study's results on willingness-to-pay the extra money by the customers for e-groceries deliveries based on crowd-shipping. The proposed methodology was tested for Ukraine, i.e., a developing country where the crowd-shipping services are under development conditions. To account for the behavior complexity of the consumers who have not faced the crowd-shipping services in the past, the choice model was enhanced with a latent variable. The findings indicate the revealed readiness of the e-shoppers to pay extra money for crowd-shipping delivery if it provides more flexible and consumer-oriented service. The expected environmental impact of the crowd-shipping delivery was not considered as important by the e-shoppers, which is explained by low concerns about the environment and car-oriented mobility in the considered case study.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了关于消费者愿意为基于众包配送的电子杂货配送支付额外费用的行为研究结果。该方法在乌克兰进行了测试，即一个众包配送服务正在发展的发展中国家。为了考虑到消费者的行为复杂性，选择模型被增加了一个潜在变量。研究结果表明，如果众包配送提供更灵活和以消费者为导向的服务，电子购物者有意愿为众包配送配送支付额外费用。众包配送的预期环境影响并不被电子购物者认为很重要，这可以通过对所考虑的案例研究中环境和以汽车为导向的流动性的低关注度来解释。",
