    "abstract": "The warming of the Arctic, also known as Arctic amplification, is led by several atmospheric and oceanic drivers, however, the details of its underlying thermodynamic causes are still unknown. Inferring the causal effects of atmospheric processes on sea ice melt using fixed treatment effect strategies leads to unrealistic counterfactual estimations. Such models are also prone to bias due to time-varying confoundedness. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TCINet - time-series causal inference model to infer causation under continuous treatment using recurrent neural networks. Through experiments on synthetic and observational data, we show how our research can substantially improve the ability to quantify the leading causes of Arctic sea ice melt.",

    "translated_abstract": "北极变暖，也称北极放大，由多种大气和海洋因素导致，但其基础热力因素的详细情况仍不清楚。使用固定治疗效应策略推断大气过程对海冰融化的因果效应会导致不现实的反事实估计。这样的模型也容易受到时间变化的混淆的影响而引起偏差。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了TCINet - 一种基于循环神经网络的时间序列因果推断模型，以连续治疗方式推断因果关系。通过对合成和观测数据的实验，我们展示了我们的研究如何大大提高量化北极海冰融化的主要原因的能力。",
