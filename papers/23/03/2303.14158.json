    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种几乎实时的方法，可以从单目RGBD视频序列中进行未知对象的6-DoF跟踪，同时执行对象的神经3D重建。我们的方法适用于任意刚性对象，即使视觉纹理基本缺失。仅在第一帧中假定对象被分割。不需要额外信息，并且不对交互代理做任何假设。我们方法的关键是在姿态图优化过程中同时学习的神经对象场，从而将信息稳健地累积到一致的3D表示中，捕捉几何和外观。自动维护一个动态的目前存储的内存帧池，以便这些线程之间进行通信。我们的方法应用于具有大姿态变化，部分和完全遮挡，无纹理表面和反射高光的具有挑战性的序列上。我们在HO3D，YCBInEOAT和BEHAVE数据集上展示了结果，证明了我们的方法的有效性。",
