    "abstract": "The continuous development of Question Answering (QA) datasets has drawn the research community's attention toward multi-domain models. A popular approach is to use multi-dataset models, which are models trained on multiple datasets to learn their regularities and prevent overfitting to a single dataset. However, with the proliferation of QA models in online repositories such as GitHub or Hugging Face, an alternative is becoming viable. Recent works have demonstrated that combining expert agents can yield large performance gains over multi-dataset models. To ease research in multi-agent models, we extend UKP-SQuARE, an online platform for QA research, to support three families of multi-agent systems: i) agent selection, ii) early-fusion of agents, and iii) late-fusion of agents. We conduct experiments to evaluate their inference speed and discuss the performance vs. speed trade-off compared to multi-dataset models.

    "translated_abstract": "问题回答（QA）数据集的不断发展已引起研究界对多领域模型的关注。一种常见的方法是使用多数据集模型，这些模型经过多个数据集的训练，以学习它们的规律并防止对单个数据集过度拟合。然而，随着在线代码库（如GitHub或Hugging Face）中QA模型的激增，另一种方法正在变得可行。最近的研究表明，结合专家智能体可以比多数据集模型获得更大的性能提升。为了方便多智能体模型的研究，我们将UKP-SQuARE扩展为支持三种多智能体系统：i）智能体选择，ii）智能体的早期融合，以及iii）智能体的后期融合。我们进行实验以评估它们的推断速度，并与多数据集模型进行性能与速度权衡的讨论。UKP-SQuARE是开源的，公开可用。",
