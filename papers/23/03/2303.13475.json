    "translated_abstract": "近年来，用户使用金融服务的方式发生了变革。随着数字化技术的发展，越来越多的用户更喜欢在线方式来执行金融活动。这导致了大量的金融内容的生成。大多数投资者在做出决策前都会阅读这些内容。每个行业都有特定于其运营领域的术语。银行和金融服务也不例外。为了完全理解这些内容，需要对金融术语有深入的了解。当用它所属的广义类别来说明时，一个术语的基本概念变得容易。这个广义类别被称为上义词。例如，“债券”是金融术语“替代债券”的上义词。在本文中，我们提出了一个系统，能够提取和排序给定金融术语的上义词。该系统经过金融文本训练，并使用神经网络学习不同金融术语之间的语义相似度。所提出的系统可用于提高对复杂金融术语的理解，帮助投资者做出明智的决策。",
