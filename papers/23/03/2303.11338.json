    "translated_abstract": "尽管机器和深度学习系统在许多领域取得了巨大的成功，但它们尚未能够在医疗保健的关键任务中牢固地确立自己。其中一个主要原因在于，当模型面对之前未见过的分布之外的样本时，它们的性能会显著下降。这就是领域泛化（DG）问题。我们的目标是提出一个评估DG算法的基准，并引入一种新颖的架构来解决生物信号分类中的DG问题。在本文中，我们描述了生物信号的领域泛化问题，重点关注心电图（ECG）和脑电图（EEG），并提出并实现了一个开源生物信号领域泛化评估基准。此外，我们将计算机视觉领域的最先进DG算法改进为1D生物信号分类问题，并评估它们的有效性。最后，我们还介绍了一种新颖的神经网络架构，称为DGNet-Bio，专门设计用于解决生物信号中的DG问题。我们的实验表明，DGNet-Bio在新提出的ECG和EEG分类领域泛化基准上优于现有方法。",
