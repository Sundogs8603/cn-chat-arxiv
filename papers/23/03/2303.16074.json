    "translated_abstract": "内存层次结构对于系统的性能和能源消耗具有很高的影响。此外，目前的嵌入式系统，包括移动设备，专门设计用于运行大量内存的多媒体应用程序。这增加了对内存子系统的压力，并影响性能和能源消耗。在这方面，热问题、性能降低和高能源消耗等因素会对设备造成不可逆的损害。我们通过三个方法作为单一方法论整合，来优化整个内存子系统。首先，分析和优化寄存器文件的热影响。其次，通过优化缓存配置并根据运行应用程序来改善性能和能源消费，解决缓存存储器的问题。最后，我们简化了通用和定制的动态内存管理器的设计和评估过程，将其应用于主内存中。为此，我们采用了不同的翻译技术来提高内存子系统的性能和能源效率。",
