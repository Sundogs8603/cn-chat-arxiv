    "translated_abstract": "预定义的操作基元被广泛用于布料操作。然而，诸如僵硬度或密度等布料属性可能会严重影响这些基元的性能。虽然现有解决方案已经解决了挑选和放置位置的参数化问题，但准静态和动态操作基元的速度或轨迹等因素的影响却被忽略了。选择适当的这些参数的值对于处理家庭布物物品中存在的材料范围非常重要。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了Quasi-Dynamic Parameterisable（QDP）方法，它优化了参数，例如准静态和动态操作基元的运动速度以外，还包括挑选和放置位置。在这项工作中，我们利用串行强化学习的框架来顺序解耦组成基元的参数。为了评估该方法的有效性，我们专注于布料平整和堆叠的任务。",
