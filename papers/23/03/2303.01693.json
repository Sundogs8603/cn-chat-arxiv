    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于数据驱动模型（如深度神经网络）的软机器人建模和状态推断显示出了很大的潜力。然而，深度模型需要大量的数据才能有效地运行，这需要进行详尽和质量良好的数据采集，尤其是状态标签的采集。因此，由于软机器人的传感器化困难和在非结构化环境中收集数据的不便等原因，获取标注的软机器人系统状态数据存在挑战。为了解决这个挑战，本文提出了一个半监督顺序变分贝叶斯（DSVB）框架，用于处理某些机器人配置中存在缺失状态标签的软机器人的迁移学习和状态推断。考虑到软机器人在不同的机器人配置下可能展现出不同的动力学特性，我们还引入了特征空间迁移策略，以促进在多个配置下的潜在特征的适应。",
