    "translated_abstract": "实际时间序列数据集通常是多变量且具有复杂的动态。为了捕获这种复杂性，像循环或基于注意力的顺序深度学习模型这样的高容量结构变得受欢迎。然而，最近的研究表明，简单的单变量线性模型可以在几个常用的学术基准测试中胜过这样的深度学习模型。扩展它们，本文研究线性模型在时间序列预测中的能力，并提出了时序混合器（TSMixer），这是一种通过堆叠多层感知器（MLP）设计的新型结构。 TSMixer基于沿时间和特征维度的混合操作，以有效地提取信息。在流行的学术基准测试上，简单易行的TSMixer与利用特定基准的归纳偏差的专业先进模型相媲美。在具有挑战性和大规模的M5基准测试中，即一个实际的零售数据集上，TSMixer表现出非常出色的性能。",
