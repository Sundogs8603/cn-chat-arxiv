    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型已经在各种自然语言任务中展示出令人印象深刻的零-shot能力，例如摘要、对话生成和问答。虽然在临床医学中有许多有前途的应用，但这些模型在实际环境中的应用往往受到它们生成错误甚至有时是有害言论的限制。在本研究中，我们开发了Almanac，这是一个带有检索能力的大型语言模型框架，用于医疗指南和治疗建议。由5名董事会认证和住院医师评估的130个临床场景的新数据集的表现表明，在所有专业领域中，事实性显著提高（在p值<0.05的情况下增加了18%的平均值），并改善了完备性和安全性。我们的结果表明，大型语言模型有潜力成为临床决策过程中有效的工具，同时也强调了正确性的重要性。",
