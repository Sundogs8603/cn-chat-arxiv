    "translated_abstract": "整个过程挖掘中最突出的问题是规范性流程监控，它包括确定一组操作以优化感兴趣的目标测量或关键绩效指标（KPI）为目标的推荐过程。这一问题的挑战在于必须仅基于存储在所谓的执行日志中的有时标注（流程）执行数据提供规范性流程监控技术，因缺乏精心制作和人工验证的明确模型。本文旨在提出一种基于人工智能的方法，通过强化学习（RL）的方式从过去的执行记录中学习最佳策略并推荐优化感兴趣的KPI的最佳操作。首先通过从数据中学习针对特定KPI的马尔可夫决策过程，并使用RL训练来学习最佳策略，从而实现该目标。该方法在真实数据集和模拟数据集上得到验证，并与其他方法进行了比较。",
