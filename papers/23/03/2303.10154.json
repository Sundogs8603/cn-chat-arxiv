    "translated_abstract": "遗传算法是生物启发式方法的一个著名例子。它们通过建模多个操作符，如突变、交叉和选择，来模仿自然选择。最近发现了“在遗传基础之上”或“除遗传基础之外”发生的表观遗传调控过程，它们涉及影响和改善基因表达的变化。这引发了一个问题，即通过建模表观遗传操作符来改善遗传算法（GAs）。本文提出了一种新的表观遗传算法，模拟了被称为DNA甲基化的表观遗传现象。我们的表观遗传算法的创新之处主要在于利用了注意机制和深度学习，这与增强/沉默基因的概念相契合。本文提出了理论论证，并进行了实证研究，展示了所提出的表观遗传算法解决更复杂问题的能力，这是简单遗传算法所不能做到的，例如，面对特定的约束优化问题，我们的算法表现出了更出色的效果。",
