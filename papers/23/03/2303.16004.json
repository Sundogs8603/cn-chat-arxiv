Traditional detection methods based on signatures and heuristics are used for malware detection, but unfortunately, they suffer from poor generalization to unknown attacks and can be easily circumvented using obfuscation techniques. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) and notably Deep Learning (DL) achieved impressive results in malware detection by learning useful representations from data and have become a solution preferred over traditional methods. More recently, the application of such techniques on graph-structured data has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various domains and demonstrates promising results in learning more robust representations from malware.

    "translated_abstract": "随着恶意软件数量和复杂性的增加，恶意软件检测已成为一个重要的问题。传统的基于签名和启发式的检测方法用于恶意软件检测，但不幸的是，它们在未知攻击方面的泛化能力较差，并且可以通过混淆技术轻松规避。近年来，机器学习（ML）和特别是深度学习（DL）通过从数据中学习有用的表示来在恶意软件检测方面取得了显著的成果，并且已成为传统方法的首选解决方案。最近，在基于图结构的数据上应用这些技术已在各个领域取得了最先进的性能，并展示了从恶意软件中学习更健壮表示的有希望的结果。然而，还没有关于基于图形深度学习进行恶意软件检测的文献综述。在本综述中，我们提供了一份深入的文献综述，概括和统一了现有的作品。",
