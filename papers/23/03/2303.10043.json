    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在暂时和永久价格影响存在下的股票最优清算策略，并侧重于加密货币的情况。首先，我们提出了针对线性暂时影响、线性和二次永久影响问题的解析解。然后，利用BNB加密货币订单簿中的数据，我们估计了三种不同情景下的暂时和永久价格影响的函数形式：低估、高估和平均估计，发现每个情景下有不同的函数形式。利用有限差分和最优策略迭代，我们通过校准暂时和永久价格影响的线性和幂函数，数值求解了问题并观察到了最优清算策略的有趣变化。然后，利用这些最优策略，我们确定了最佳清算路径，并模拟了初始清算库存的清算，以比较最优策略和一些基准策略的表现。结果表明，忽略永久价格影响会导致次优的清算策略，并且考虑价格影响的非线性函数形式可以显著提高清算的表现。",

The study provides analytical solutions for linear temporary impact, as well as linear and quadratic permanent impact. Using data from the BNB cryptocurrency order book, the paper identifies different functional forms for temporary and permanent price impacts. The study concludes that ignoring permanent price impact leads to suboptimal liquidation strategies and proposes that considering non-linear functional forms for the price impact can significantly improve performance."
