    "translated_abstract": "实体解析的目标是识别在多个数据集中代表同一实际实体的记录。为了减少运行时间，实体解析流水线由两部分构成：使用计算成本低的方法选择候选记录对的阻塞器和使用计算成本高的方法从该集合中识别匹配对的匹配器。本文提出了SC-Block，一种阻塞方法，它利用监督对比学习来定位嵌入空间中的记录，并使用最近邻搜索来建立候选集合。我们将SC-Block与八种最先进的阻塞方法进行了基准测试。为了将SC-Block的训练时间与实体解析流水线的总运行时间的缩短联系起来，我们将SC-Block与四种匹配方法结合成完整的流水线。为了测量总体运行时间，我们使用了两个真实数据集。实验结果表明，SC-Block在保证精度的同时显著缩短了运行时间，比现有方法更优秀。",
