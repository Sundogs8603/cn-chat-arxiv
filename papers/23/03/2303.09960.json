We show that for monotone functions of this form, the stochastic continuous greedy algorithm attains an approximation ratio (in expectation) arbitrarily close to $(1-1/e) \\approx 63\\%$ using a polynomial estimation of the gradient.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在在线学习、团队组建、设施选址、影响最大化、主动学习和感知目标函数等领域中自然而然出现的带有一般拟阵约束的随机子模最大化问题。我们针对一类由未知分布下的子模函数期望定义的随机最大化问题进行了研究。我们展示了对于这种单调函数，使用多项式梯度估算器的随机连续贪心算法可以达到 $(1-1/e) \\approx 63\\%$ 的近似比（期望值），同时我们也证明了使用多项式估算器代替先前采用采样的算法能够消除一些随机因素并显著降低执行时间。",
