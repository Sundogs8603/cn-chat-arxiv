    "translated_abstract": "大规模谣言通常伴随着突发新闻或热门话题而出现，严重阻碍真相的查证。现有的谣言检测方法大多专注于相同领域，因此在跨领域情况下表现不佳。本文提出了一种端到端的基于实例和原型的，带有交叉注意力机制的对比学习模型，用于跨领域谣言检测。该模型不仅可以进行跨领域特征对齐，还可以强制目标样本与给定源域的相应原型对齐。由于目标域中的目标标签不可用，因此我们使用一种聚类的方法，并通过一批源域样本的仔细初始化中心来产生伪标签。此外，我们使用交叉注意力机制处理具有相同标签的一对源数据和目标数据，以学习域不变表示。由于领域对中的样本倾向于表达相似的语义模式，因此这种方法能够提高模型的检测性能。",
