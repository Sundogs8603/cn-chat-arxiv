    "translated_abstract": "CT扫描中器官风险（OAR）分割是放疗治疗流程的关键组成部分。近年来，深度学习技术在自动化这个过程中表现出了非凡的潜力。本文探讨了生成对抗网络（GANs）与监督学习方法在分割OARs方面的表现。我们提出了三种基于GAN的模型，这些模型具有相同的生成器结构，但具有不同的鉴别器网络。使用包含50个已注释CT扫描的StructSeg数据集比较了这些模型与良好的CNN模型，如SE-ResUnet和DeepLabV3，这些扫描包含六个OAR的轮廓。我们的工作旨在提供有关在OAR分割环境中采用对抗性训练的优缺点的见解。结果非常有希望，表明所提出的基于GAN的方法与基于CNN的方法相似或优于其对应的CNN模型，尤其是在分割更具挑战性的目标时。",
