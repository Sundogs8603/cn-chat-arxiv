    "translated_abstract": "随着扩散模型和ChatGPT的惊人成功，深度生成模型(DGMs)正在经历2022年的爆炸式增长。不限于内容生成，由于其出色的复杂模式表示能力和生成出可信样本的能力，DGMs也被广泛应用于物联网、元宇宙和数字孪生等领域。在本文中，我们探讨了DGMs在重要任务中的应用，即提高无线网络管理的效率。具体来说，我们首先概述了生成AI，以及三种代表性的DGMs。然后，我们提出了一种基于DGMs增强的无线网络管理框架，在框架中详细说明了传统网络管理方法的问题，以及为什么DGMs能够高效地解决这些问题，并阐述了在管理无线网络中应用DGMs的逐步工作流程。此外，我们还使用最先进的DGM模型——扩散模型，在网络经济学上进行了一项案例研究，以生成有效的内容。",
