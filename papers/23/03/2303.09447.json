    "abstract": "Prototype, as a representation of class embeddings, has been explored to reduce memory footprint or mitigate forgetting for continual learning scenarios. However, prototype-based methods still suffer from abrupt performance deterioration due to semantic drift and prototype interference. In this study, we propose Contrastive Prototypical Prompt (CPP) and show that task-specific prompt-tuning, when optimized over a contrastive learning objective, can effectively address both obstacles and significantly improve the potency of prototypes. Our experiments demonstrate that CPP excels in four challenging class-incremental learning benchmarks, resulting in 4% to 6% absolute improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, CPP does not require a rehearsal buffer and it largely bridges the performance gap between continual learning and offline joint-learning, showcasing a promising design scheme for continual learning systems under a Transformer architecture.",

    "translated_abstract": "原型作为类别嵌入的一种表示，已被探索用于减少连续学习情境下的内存占用或减轻遗忘。然而，基于原型的方法仍然存在语义漂移和原型干扰导致的性能急剧恶化的问题。在本研究中，我们提出了对比原型提示（CPP）方法，并展示了任务特定提示调整，当在对比学习目标上进行优化时，可以有效地解决这两个障碍并显着提高原型的性能。我们的实验表明，CPP在四个具有挑战性的类增量学习基准测试中表现出色，相对于现有最先进方法有4%至6%的绝对提升。此外，CPP不需要重复训练，它极大地缩小了连续学习和离线联合学习之间的性能差距，展示了一种有前途的Transformer体系结构下连续学习系统的设计方案。",
