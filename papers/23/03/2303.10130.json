    "abstract": "We investigate the potential implications of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models and related technologies on the U.S. labor market. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their correspondence with GPT capabilities, incorporating both human expertise and classifications from GPT-4. Our findings indicate that approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of GPTs, while around 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. The influence spans all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure. Notably, the impact is not limited to industries with higher recent productivity growth. We conclude that Generative Pre-trained Transformers exhibit characteristics of general-purpose technologies (GPTs), suggesting that as these models could have notable economic, social, and policy implications.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了生成预训练变压器（GPT）模型和相关技术对美国劳动力市场的潜在影响。使用新的标准，我们评估职业与GPT能力的对应关系，结合人类专业知识和GPT-4的分类。我们的研究结果表明，约80%的美国劳动力可能会至少有10%的工作任务受到GPT引入的影响，而约19%的工人可能会看到至少50%的任务受到影响。影响范围涵盖了所有工资水平，高收入工作可能面临更大的风险。值得注意的是，影响并不局限于最近生产率增长较高的行业。我们得出结论，生成预训练变压器具有通用技术（GPT）的特性，表明这些模型可能具有显著的经济、社会和政策影响。",
