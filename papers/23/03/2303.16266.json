    "abstract": "An increasing part of energy is produced from renewable sources by a large number of small producers. The efficiency of these sources is volatile and, to some extent, random, exacerbating the energy market balance problem. In many countries, that balancing is performed on day-ahead (DA) energy markets. In this paper, we consider automated trading on a DA energy market by a medium size prosumer. We model this activity as a Markov Decision Process and formalize a framework in which a ready-to-use strategy can be optimized with real-life data. We synthesize parametric trading strategies and optimize them with an evolutionary algorithm. We also use state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize a black-box trading strategy fed with available information from the environment that can impact future prices.",

    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的能源来自大量小型生产者的可再生能源，这些来源的效率是不稳定的，在某种程度上也是随机的，加剧了能源市场平衡问题。在许多国家，这种平衡是在预测日（DA）能源市场上完成的。本文考虑由中型生产者在DA能源市场上的自动化交易。我们将此活动建模为马尔可夫决策过程，并规范了一个框架，其中可以使用现实数据优化即用策略。我们合成参数化交易策略，并使用进化算法优化它们。我们还使用最先进的强化学习算法优化一个黑盒交易策略，该策略利用来自环境的可用信息来影响未来价格。",
