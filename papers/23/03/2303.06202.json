    "abstract": "Vehicle Trajectory datasets that provide multiple point-of-views (POVs) can be valuable for various traffic safety and management applications. Despite the abundance of trajectory datasets, few offer a comprehensive and diverse range of driving scenes, capturing multiple viewpoints of various highway layouts, merging lanes, and configurations. This limits their ability to capture the nuanced interactions between drivers, vehicles, and the roadway infrastructure. We introduce the \\emph{Carolinas Highway Dataset (CHD\\footnote{\\emph{CHD} available at: \\url{https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/Carolinas\\_Dataset}})}, a vehicle trajectory, detection, and tracking dataset. \\emph{CHD} is a collection of 1.6 million frames captured in highway-based videos from eye-level and high-angle POVs at eight locations across Carolinas with 338,000 vehicle trajectories. The locations, timing of recordings, and camera angles were carefully selected to capture various road geometries, traffic patterns, lighting ",
