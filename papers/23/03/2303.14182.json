    "abstract": "In 2013, TSOs from the Central European Region complained to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators because of increasing unplanned flows that were presumed to be caused by a joint German-Austrian bidding zone in the European electricity market. This paper empirically analyses the effects of the split of this bidding zone in 2018 on planned and unplanned cross-border flows between Germany, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. For all bidding zones, apart from the German-Austrian one, planned flows increased. Further, I find that around the policy intervention between 2017 and 2019, unplanned flows between Germany and Austria as well as for the Czech Republic and Slovakia decreased. However, for Poland increasing unplanned flows are found.",

    "translated_abstract": "2013年，中欧地区的输电系统操作商向能源监管机构投诉因欧洲电力市场中德国-奥地利联合竞价区域而造成的越来越多的未计划电力流。本文实证分析了2018年该竞标区域分割对德国、奥地利、波兰、捷克、斯洛伐克和匈牙利之间计划内和未计划的跨境电力流量的影响。除德国-奥地利竞标区域外，所有区域中计划内电力流量都有所增加。此外，作者发现在2017年至2019年政策干预期间，德国和奥地利以及捷克和斯洛伐克之间的未计划电力流量有所减少，但波兰的未计划电力流量却在增加。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了奥地利和德国竞价区域的分割对中欧地区计划内和未计划的跨境电力流的影响。作者发现，分割后计划内电力流量增加，且在政策干预期间，德国和奥地利以及捷克和斯洛伐克之间的未计划电力流有所减少，但波兰的未计划电力流量却在增加。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the effect of the split of the German-Austrian bidding zone on planned and unplanned cross-border flows between Germany, Austria, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. The results show an increase in planned flows and a decrease in unplanned flows between Germany-Austria and Czech Republic-Slovakia during the policy intervention, while Poland has increasing unplanned flows."
