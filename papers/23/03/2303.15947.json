    "translated_abstract": "在手术室中记录手术是教育和评估医疗治疗的重要任务。然而，由于手术过程中目标受到严重的遮挡，如手术场地、手术工具或医生的手，所以记录这些目标是困难的。我们使用一个记录系统，在手术灯中嵌入多个摄像头，并假定任何时候至少有一台摄像机在记录没有遮挡的目标。由于嵌入的摄像机获得了多个视频序列，我们解决了从多个视频序列中选择最佳手术视图的任务。与传统方法不同，该方法基于手术场地的面积大小选择摄像机，我们提出了一种深度神经网络，通过学习专家注释的监督来预测摄像机选择概率。我们创建了一个数据集，记录了六种不同类型的整容手术，并提供了摄像机切换的注释。",
