    "translated_abstract": "反对抗系统研究的最新进展已经导致开发了逆随机滤波器，这些滤波器被防御者用来推断其对手可能学到的信息。早期的作品通过针对线性和非线性高斯状态空间模型分别提出了逆卡尔曼滤波器（I-KF）和逆扩展KF（I-EKF）来解决这个逆认知问题。然而，在实践中，很多反对抗性设置会涉及高度非线性的系统模型，其中EKF的线性化常常会失败。在本文中，我们考虑了有效的数值积分技术来解决这种非线性问题，并因此开发了逆多面积积分卡尔曼滤波器（I-CKF）和逆多项式积分卡尔曼滤波器（I-QKF）。我们在指数-平均-二次有界性意义下推导了所提出的滤波器的随机稳定性条件。数值实验证明了我们的I-CKF和I-QKF的估计精度，跟递归Cram\\'{e}r-Rao下界作为基准。",
