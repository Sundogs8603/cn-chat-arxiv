    "translated_abstract": "加性噪声模型（ANM）是一种常见的功能假设，可以从观测数据中学习因果结构。由于缺乏符合假设的真实世界数据，合成ANM数据经常用于评估因果发现算法。Reisach等人（2021）表明，对于常见的模拟参数，按增大方差的顺序变量排列与因果顺序密切相关，并引入变异性可排序性来量化这种对齐程度。本文还表明，除了方差，还有变量的方差被所有其他变量解释的比例（由决定系数$R^2$捕获）倾向于沿着因果顺序增加。简单的基准算法可以使用$R^2$-sortability来匹配已有方法的性能。由于$R^2$可排序性不受数据缩放的影响，这些算法在标准化或重新缩放的数据上表现同样出色，解决了利用变异性可排序性的算法的一个关键限制。",
