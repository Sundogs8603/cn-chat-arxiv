    "abstract": "The analysis of distributed techniques is often focused upon their efficiency, without considering their robustness (or lack thereof). Such a consideration is particularly important when devices or central servers can fail, which can potentially cripple distributed systems. When such failures arise in wireless communications networks, important services that they use/provide (like anomaly detection) can be left inoperable and can result in a cascade of security problems. In this paper, we present a novel method to address these risks by combining both flat- and star-topologies, combining the performance and reliability benefits of both. We refer to this method as \"Tol-FL\", due to its increased failure-tolerance as compared to the technique of Federated Learning. Our approach both limits device failure risks while outperforming prior methods by up to 8% in terms of anomaly detection AUROC in a range of realistic settings that consider client as well as server failure, all while reducing",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数分布式技术的分析都是专注于它们的效率，而没有考虑它们的鲁棒性（或缺乏鲁棒性）。然而，这种考虑尤其重要，因为当设备或中央服务器出现故障时，这可能会瘫痪分布式系统。本文提出了一种通过结合扁平和星型拓扑结构来解决这些风险的新方法，将两者的性能和可靠性优势相结合。我们将这种方法称为“Tol-FL”，因为与联邦学习技术相比，它的故障容错能力提高了。我们的方法在客户端和服务器故障的各种逼真情况下，在异常检测AUROC方面优于先前方法高达8％，同时减少了设备故障风险。",
