Although there are already some valuable surveys on causal recommendations, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack theoretical analysis of existing methods. Due to the unfamiliarity with causality to RS researchers, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies from the perspective of causal theory, which might be instructive for the readers to propose new approaches in practice.

    "translated_title": "推荐系统因果推断综述",
    "translated_abstract": "最近，因果推断引起了推荐系统研究人员的越来越多的关注。因果推断分析因果关系并在多个领域具有广泛的实际应用。因果推断可以对推荐系统中的因果关系进行建模如混淆效应，并处理离线策略评估和数据增强等反事实问题。虽然已经有一些有价值的因果推荐综述，但是这些综述相对孤立地介绍了方法，并缺乏对现有方法的理论分析。由于推荐系统研究人员对因果关系的陌生程度，从因果理论的角度全面审查相关研究对于提出新的实践方法具有指导意义，也是必要的和具有挑战性的。这篇综述试图从理论的角度系统综述这一领域的最新论文。",
    "tldr": "该综述从理论的角度系统综述因果推断在推荐系统中的应用，将现有文献分为三类进行讨论，并探讨了各自的优缺点。针对推荐系统研究人员对因果关系的陌生程度，本文试图提高读者对因果关系的认识，并为今后的研究提供指导和方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This survey provides a theoretic review of causal inference for recommendation, categorizing the literature into three groups and discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each. It also highlights the importance of increasing familiarity with causality in the field and suggests promising directions for future research."
