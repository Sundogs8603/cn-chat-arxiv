    "abstract": "The ability to explain why a machine learning model arrives at a particular prediction is crucial when used as decision support by human operators of critical systems. The provided explanations must be provably correct, and preferably without redundant information, called minimal explanations. In this paper, we aim at finding explanations for predictions made by tree ensembles that are not only minimal, but also minimum with respect to a cost function.  To this end, we first present a highly efficient oracle that can determine the correctness of explanations, surpassing the runtime performance of current state-of-the-art alternatives by several orders of magnitude when computing minimal explanations.  Secondly, we adapt an algorithm called MARCO from related works (calling it m-MARCO) for the purpose of computing a single minimum explanation per prediction, and demonstrate an overall speedup factor of two compared to the MARCO algorithm which enumerates all minimal explanations.

    "translated_abstract": "当机器学习模型作为关键系统的决策支持时，能够解释为何模型做出特定预测的能力至关重要。提供的解释必须是可证明的，并且最好不包含冗余信息，即最小解释。本文旨在寻找树集成模型预测的解释，这些解释不仅是最小的，而且在成本函数方面也是最小的。为此，我们首先提出了一个高效的“神谕”系统，可以确定解释的正确性，在计算最小解释时超越了当前最先进的替代方案的运行表现数个数量级。其次，我们改编了来自相关工作的叫做MARCO的算法（将其称为m-MARCO），目的是计算每个预测的单个最小解释，并证明相对于枚举所有最小解释的MARCO算法，我们的方法具有两倍的总体加速比。",
