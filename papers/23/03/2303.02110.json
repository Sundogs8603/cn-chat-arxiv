    "translated_abstract": "人工智能方法在核医学中引起了广泛的兴趣，其中特别关注使用基于深度学习（DL）的方法去噪低剂量、短采集时间或两者同时获取的图像。这些方法的客观评估对于临床应用至关重要。DL去噪核医学图像通常使用类似RMSE和SSIM这样的保真度（FoMs）进行评估。然而，这些图像是为临床任务而采集的，因此应该根据它们在这些任务中的表现来评估。本研究的目的是(1)调查使用这些FoMs的评估是否与客观的临床任务评估一致; (2)提供用于确定去噪对信号检测任务影响的理论分析; (3)展示虚拟临床试验（VCTs）用于评估DL方法的实用性。使用逼真的模拟器进行了一个VCT来评估DL去噪心肌灌注SPECT图像方法。采用客观的强制选择实验，使用信号检测理论（SDT）的基于任务的指标和FoMs评估了去噪效果。结果表明，使用FoMs评估去噪效果不一定与基于任务的评估相关。SDT指标提供了更客观和有意义的去噪效果评估方式。VCTs可为核医学中基于DL的去噪方法的评估提供有用的工具。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study aims to investigate the performance evaluation of deep learning-based image denoising methods in clinical tasks. It was found that evaluating with fidelity-based figures of merit (FoMs) does not necessarily correlate with task-based evaluation, while task-based measures based on signal detection theory (SDT) provide a more objective and meaningful evaluation of denoising performance. Virtual clinical trials (VCTs) are proven to be useful tools for evaluating DL-based denoising methods in nuclear medicine."
