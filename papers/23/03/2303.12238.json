    "translated_abstract": "及时预估交通事故的影响可以指导人们的出行规划，提高交通机构决策韧性。然而，相比于节点级和图级预测任务，它更具挑战性，因为它需要从动态图中提取异常子图或子时间序列。在本文中，我们提出了DG-Trans，一种新颖的交通事故影响预测框架，通过动态图学习预见交通事故的影响。所提出的框架包含一个双层空间变换器和一个基于重要性得分的时态变换器，并通过两个新构建的基准数据集验证了该框架的性能。双层空间变换器删除节点之间的不必要的边缘，将受影响的子图与其他节点隔离开来。与此同时，基于重要性得分的时态变换器识别节点特征的异常变化，使预测更依赖于最近的过去。",
