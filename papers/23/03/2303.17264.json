    "translated_abstract": "将复杂数据去关联成为其潜在变化因素是表示学习中的基本任务。现有的关于顺序去关联的工作大多提供两个因素表示，即将数据分离为时变和时不变因素。相反，我们考虑多因素去关联，其中生成多个（超出两个）语义去关联组件。我们的方法的关键是强大的归纳偏差，即我们假设潜在动态可以在潜在空间中线性表达。在这种假设下，利用最近引入的 Koopman 自编码器模型就变得自然。但是，在 Koopman 方法中并不能保证得到去关联表示，因此我们提出了一种新的谱损失项，可以得到结构化 Koopman 矩阵和解关联。总体上，我们提出了一个简单易用的新深度模型，完全无监督，支持多因素去关联。我们展示了我们方法在各种数据集上的新去关联能力，包括动态纹理和动作捕捉数据。",
