    "translated_title": "基于生理信号的多尺度深度学习疼痛分类的Transformer编码器",
    "translated_abstract": "疼痛是世界范围内的一个严重健康问题，它影响着大部分人。为了有效地管理和治疗疼痛，需要准确分类和评估疼痛的严重程度。然而，由于疼痛是主观感受驱动的体验，这可能有一定的挑战性。传统的测量疼痛强度的技术，例如自我报告量表，在某些情况下容易出现偏见且不可靠。因此，需要更客观和自动的疼痛强度评估策略。本文提出了PainAttnNet（PAN），一种基于生理信号输入的用于分类疼痛强度的新型Transformer编码器深度学习框架。所提出的方法由三个特征提取架构组成：多尺度卷积网络（MSCN）、压缩与激发残余网络（SEResNet）和Transformer编码器块。根据疼痛刺激，MSCN提取短时和长时窗口信息，以及序列特征，SEResNet进一步减少道次，然后传递到Transformer编码器进行疼痛分类。结果表明，PAN可为自动疼痛强度分级提供有用信息。",
