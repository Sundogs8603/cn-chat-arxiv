    "abstract": "ChatGPT, a question-and-answer dialogue system based on a large language model, has gained huge popularity since its introduction. Its positive aspects have been reported through many media platforms, and some analyses even showed that ChatGPT achieved a decent grade in professional exams, including the law, medical, and finance domains, adding extra support to the claim that AI now can assist and, even, replace humans in industrial fields. Others, however, doubt its reliability and trustworthiness. In this paper, we investigate ChatGPT's trustworthiness regarding logically consistent behaviours. Our findings suggest that, although ChatGPT seems to achieve an improved language understanding ability, it still fails to generate logically correct predictions frequently. Hence, while it is true that ChatGPT is an impressive and promising new technique, we conclude that its usage in real-world applications without thorough human inspection requires further consideration, especially for risk",

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT是一种基于大型语言模型的问答对话系统，自推出以来广受欢迎。虽然它在法律、医学和金融等领域的专业考试中取得了不错的成绩，但也有人对其可靠性和信任度表示怀疑。本文针对ChatGPT在逻辑一致性方面的可信度进行了调查研究。我们的研究发现，尽管ChatGPT似乎具有更好的语言理解能力，但它仍然经常无法生成逻辑上正确的预测。因此，虽然ChatGPT是一种令人印象深刻和有前途的新技术，但我们得出结论，如果没有经过彻底的人工检查，它在现实世界的应用需要进一步考虑，特别是在风险方面。",
