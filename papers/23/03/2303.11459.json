    "abstract": "Graphs are mathematical tools that can be used to represent complex real-world systems, such as financial markets and social networks. Hence, machine learning (ML) over graphs has attracted significant attention recently. However, it has been demonstrated that ML over graphs amplifies the already existing bias towards certain under-represented groups in various decision-making problems due to the information aggregation over biased graph structures. Faced with this challenge, in this paper, we design a fair graph filter that can be employed in a versatile manner for graph-based learning tasks. The design of the proposed filter is based on a bias analysis and its optimality in mitigating bias compared to its fairness-agnostic counterpart is established. Experiments on real-world networks for node classification demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed filter design in mitigating bias, while attaining similar utility and better stability compared to baseline algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "图是用来表示复杂的现实世界系统的数学工具，例如金融市场和社交网络。因此，最近图机器学习（ML）引起了重要的关注。然而，由于在偏见图结构上的信息聚合，已经证明了 ML 对于各种决策问题中已存在的某些欠代表群体的偏见的放大。面对这一挑战，本文设计了一种公平图滤波器，可在各种基于图的学习任务中灵活使用。所提出的滤波器设计基于偏见分析，并建立了其在缓解偏见方面的优越性与其无关公平性对应物相比的最优性。节点分类的实验表明，该提议的过滤器设计在减轻偏见方面具有显著的功效，同时相对于基准算法，实用度更高且更稳定。",
