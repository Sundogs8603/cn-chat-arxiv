    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人工智能组件构成的系统，即所谓的基于人工智能的系统，已经引起了极大的关注。然而，许多组织在实现这样的系统的生产准备方面存在问题。作为提高某些软件质量属性和解决经常出现的问题的手段，设计模式提供了可靠的解决方案蓝图。在AI-based系统出现新模式的同时，现有模式也已经被适应到了这个新的上下文环境中。本研究的目标是提供一个基于人工智能系统的设计模式的概述，包括新模式和适应模式。我们希望收集和分类模式，并使其对研究者和从业者可访问。为此，我们首先进行了多方位文献综述（MLR）以收集与AI-based系统一起使用的设计模式。然后，我们将所创建的模式集成到一个基于web的模式存储库中，使得这些模式易于浏览和查找。结果，我们选择了51篇学术论文中的43个设计模式，这些模式分为数据处理、建模、决策和实现四个类别，分别提供了针对AI-based systems 的解决方案，从而提高软件质量和系统性能。该研究旨在为研究者和从业者提供一个完整的、易于访问的设计模式库。",
