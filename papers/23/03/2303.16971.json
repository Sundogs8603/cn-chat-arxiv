    "abstract": "Sparse joint shift (SJS) was recently proposed as a tractable model for general dataset shift which may cause changes to the marginal distributions of features and labels as well as the posterior probabilities and the class-conditional feature distributions. Fitting SJS for a target dataset without label observations may produce valid predictions of labels and estimates of class prior probabilities. We present new results on the transmission of SJS from sets of features to larger sets of features, a conditional correction formula for the class posterior probabilities under the target distribution, identifiability of SJS, and the relationship between SJS and covariate shift. In addition, we point out inconsistencies in the algorithms which were proposed for estimating the characteristics of SJS, as they could hamper the search for optimal solutions.",

    "translated_abstract": "稀疏联合偏移（SJS）是一种针对数据集整体偏移的可处理模型，可能会导致特征和标签的边际分布以及后验概率和类条件特征分布的变化。在没有标签观测的情况下，为目标数据集拟合SJS可能会产生标签的有效预测和类先验概率的估计。我们在特征集之间传递SJS方面提供了新的结果，提出了一个基于目标分布的类后验概率的条件修正公式，确定性SJS的可辨认性以及SJS和协变量转移之间的关系。此外，我们指出了用于估计SJS特征的算法中的不一致性，因为它们可能会妨碍寻找最优解。",
