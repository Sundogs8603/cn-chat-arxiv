    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一个统一的框架，用于具有缩减和正则化的快速大规模组合优化，针对不同的目标，如最小方差、平均方差和最大夏普比率，以及组合权重的各种约束条件。对于所有优化问题，我们推导出相应的二次规划问题，并在开源Python库中实现它们。我们使用所提出的框架评估了流行的协方差矩阵估计器的样本外组合表现，例如样本协方差矩阵、线性和非线性缩减估计器以及仪器化主成分分析（IPCA）的协方差矩阵。我们使用了65年间平均上市公司达585家的美国市场的月度收益率，以及用于IPCA模型的94个月度特定公司特征。我们展示了组合规范项的正则化极大地改善了IPCA模型在组合优化中的表现，结果表现良好。",
