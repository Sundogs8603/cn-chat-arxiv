Typical spinning lidars emit pulses arranged in several horizontal lines and the monetary cost of the sensor increases with the number of these lines. In this work, we present the new problem of optimizing the positioning of lidar lines to find the most effective configuration for the depth completion task. We propose a solution to reduce the number of lines while retaining the up-to-the-mark quality of depth completion. Our method consists of two components, (1) line selection based on the marginal contribution of a line computed via the Shapley value and (2) incorporating line position spread to take into account its need to arrive at image-wide depth completion. Spatially-aware Shapley values (SaS) succeed in selecting line subsets that yield a depth accuracy comparable to the full lidar input while using just half of the lines.",

    "translated_abstract": "Lidar是估计场景深度的重要传感器。 典型的旋转式Lidar发射排列在几个水平线上的脉冲，传感器的货币成本随这些线的数量增加而增加。 在本文中，我们提出了优化Lidar线路位置以寻找深度补全任务的最有效配置的新问题。 我们提出了一种解决方案，以减少线路数量，同时保持深度补全质量，这种方法包括两个组件，（1）基于Shapley值计算的线路边际贡献的线路选择，和（2）将线路位置分布结合起来，以考虑到其需要到达全局深度。具有空间感知Shapley值（SaS）成功地选择了线路子集，这些线路子集使用了一半的线路，但具有与完整的Lidar输入相当的深度精度。",
