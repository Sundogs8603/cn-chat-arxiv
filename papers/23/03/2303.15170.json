    "abstract": "We revisit identification based on timing and information set assumptions in structural models, which have been used in the context of production functions, demand equations, and hedonic pricing models (e.g. Olley and Pakes (1996), Blundell and Bond (2000)). First, we demonstrate a general under-identification problem using these assumptions in a simple version of the Blundell-Bond dynamic panel model. In particular, the basic moment conditions can yield multiple discrete solutions: one at the persistence parameter in the main equation and another at the persistence parameter governing the regressor. We then show that the problem can persist in a broader set of models but disappears in models under stronger timing assumptions. We then propose possible solutions in the simple setting by enforcing an assumed sign restriction and conclude by using lessons from our basic identification approach to propose more general practical advice for empirical researchers.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文重新审视了结构模型中基于时间和信息集假设的识别问题，这些假设在生产函数、需求方程和商品定价模型（例如Olley和Pakes（1996）、Blundell和Bond（2000））中得到了应用。首先，在简单版本的Blundell-Bond动态面板模型中，我们展示了一般性的欠识别问题。特别是，基本的矩条件可能会产生多个离散解：一个在主方程中的持续性参数，另一个在解释变量中的持续性参数。然后，我们展示了这个问题可以在更广泛的模型中持续存在，但在时间假设更强的模型中则消失。我们提出了在简单设置中通过强制假定的符号限制来解决问题，最后从我们的基本识别方法中得出启示，并提出更为普遍的实证研究建议。",
