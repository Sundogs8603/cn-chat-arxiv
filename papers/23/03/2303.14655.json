    "abstract": "Despite the recent emergence of video captioning models, how to generate vivid, fine-grained video descriptions based on the background knowledge (i.e., long and informative commentary about the domain-specific scenes with appropriate reasoning) is still far from being solved, which however has great applications such as automatic sports narrative. In this paper, we present GOAL, a benchmark of over 8.9k soccer video clips, 22k sentences, and 42k knowledge triples for proposing a challenging new task setting as Knowledge-grounded Video Captioning (KGVC).

    "translated_abstract": "尽管最近出现了许多视频字幕生成模型，但如何基于背景知识生成生动、精细的视频描述（即关于特定领域场景的详细评论，并具有适当的推理），仍然存在很大的难题。本文提出了GOAL，一个包含超过8.9k个足球视频片段、22k个句子和42k个知识三元组的基准，用于提出一种具有挑战性的新任务设置作为基于知识的视频字幕生成（KGVC）。此外，我们对现有方法进行了实验性的改进，展示了解决这一宝贵而实用任务的难度和潜在方向。我们的数据和代码可在https://github.com/THU-KEG/goal 上获得。",
