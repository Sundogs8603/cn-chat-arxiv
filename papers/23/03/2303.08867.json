    "translated_abstract": "我们展示了一个令人惊讶的简单模型的完全贝叶斯市场预期，可以恢复对金融资产价格的一系列交易影响的主要经验发现，其中包括（i）预期价格变动随总交易量呈现出平方根行为，（ii）对于小交易量，它交叉到线性区域，以及（iii）在交易序列结束后回到均衡的影响衰减。这种推导的简单性进一步支持了它的鲁棒性和普适性，并揭示了它的起源。特别地，它表明平方根影响定律源于对来自元订单的订单流的高估。",

The square-root impact law may originate from the over-estimation of order flows originating from meta-orders."
