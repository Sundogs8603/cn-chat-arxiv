    "translated_abstract": "人类行为受到限制行为的规范和规律的制约。规则、礼仪、法律和道德义务等约束行为的形式都是对人类行为进行规范的类别。这些约束系统是“复杂的”：个体约束通常定义不明确，特定情况下哪些约束是相关的可能未知或存在歧义，约束之间相互作用和冲突，确定如何在相关约束的范围内行事可能是一个重大挑战，尤其是在需要快速决策的情况下。尽管存在这样的混乱，人类仍然能够稳健、快速地将约束融入其决策中。通用的人工智能代理也必须能够在现实约束系统的混乱中进行导航，以便行为具有可预测性和可靠性。在本文中，我们对通用代理约束处理的复杂性来源进行了表征，并基于贝叶斯决策理论的思想描述了一种针对这种约束计算水平分析的方法。我们列举了几个建设通用的、遵守约束的代理的障碍，并描述了代理如何可以以最优方式考虑约束的贝叶斯计算水平模型。最后，我们讨论了我们的模型对通用智能研究的影响。",
