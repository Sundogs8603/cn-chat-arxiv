    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT是一种突破性的“聊天机器人”，它是建立在一个大型语言模型上的人工智能接口，该模型是由大量人类文本训练而成，以模拟人类对话。除了能以一种合理的方式进行交谈，它还因其能够胜任律师考试和MBA课程的问题，并能提供编写计算机代码的有用帮助等能力而受到关注。这些明显的能力引发了有关ChatGPT作为高等教育完整性的威胁的讨论，反之亦然，它也是一种强大的教学工具。在这项工作中，我们提出了对两个版本的ChatGPT（ChatGPT3.5和ChatGPT4）在大学第一学期物理学领域的表现的初步分析，使用修改版的力学概念库（FCI），评估它是否能够正确回答关于运动学和牛顿动力学的概念物理问题。我们证明，从某些方面来看，ChatGPT3.5可以匹配或超过传统教学方法的中位数表现。",
