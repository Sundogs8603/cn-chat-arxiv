    "translated_abstract": "融合机器学习和仿真的应用可以受益于使用多种计算资源，例如高度并行的超级计算机上运行仿真代码，而在专门的加速器上进行AI训练和推理任务。本文介绍了我们在这些异构系统上部署两个AI引导仿真工作流的经验。我们的方法独特之处在于使用云托管管理服务来管理跨资源的身份验证和授权、函数即服务(FaaS)函数调用和数据传输等方面的挑战。我们展示了这些方法可以实现与直接连接资源的系统相当的性能。我们通过将FaaS系统和数据传输能力与一个通过引用在管理器和工作者之间传递数据的系统集成，并使用用户可配置的转向算法来隐藏数据传输延迟来实现性能匹配。我们预计这种易用性可以实现路线的自动化和资源的最优化，使科学家们更愿意探索更复杂的问题。",
