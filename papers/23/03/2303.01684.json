    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce BO-Muse, a new approach to human-AI teaming for the optimization of expensive black-box functions. Inspired by the intrinsic difficulty of extracting expert knowledge and distilling it back into AI models and by observations of human behavior in real-world experimental design, our algorithm lets the human expert take the lead in the experimental process. The human expert can use their domain expertise to its full potential, while the AI plays the role of a muse, injecting novelty and searching for areas of weakness to break the human out of over-exploitation induced by cognitive entrenchment. With mild assumptions, we show that our algorithm converges sub-linearly, at a rate faster than the AI or human alone. We validate our algorithm using synthetic data and with human experts performing real-world experiments.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了BO-Muse，一种新的人工智能和人类专家协作的方法，用于优化昂贵的黑盒函数。受到从专家知识中提取和蒸馏回AI模型的内在困难以及对真实世界实验设计中人类行为的观察的启发，我们的算法让人类专家在实验过程中发挥主导作用。人类专家可以充分利用他们的领域专业知识，而人工智能则扮演着灵感的角色，在寻找弱点的同时注入新颖性，从而打破由认知融入引起的过度开发。在温和的假设下，我们证明了我们的算法亚线性收敛，速度快于单独使用人工智能或人类专家。我们使用合成数据以及人类专家进行真实世界实验来验证我们的算法。",
