We show that, once trained with a few example dynamics of a drive-response system, the machine is able to predict the response system's dynamics for any driver signal with the same coupling. Only a few time series data of an $A-B$ type drive-response system in training is sufficient for the ESN to learn the coupling scheme. After training even if we replace drive system $A$ with a different system $C$, the ESN can reproduce the dynamics of response system $B$ using the dynamics of new drive system $C$ only.",

    "translated_abstract": "沉积计算已经在复杂动力学领域找到了许多潜在的应用。在这篇文章中，我们利用回声状态网络（ESN）模型的异常能力，仅使用系统的几个时间序列数据，就使其学习单向耦合模式。我们展示了，一旦该模型通过一些驱动响应系统的动态训练之后，即使我们将驱动系统$A$替换为其他系统$C$，回声状态网络也能仅仅用新的驱动系统$C$的动态预测响应系统$B$的动态，我们仅仅需要一些$A-B$型的时间序列训练数据就足以让ESN学习这种耦合方式。",
