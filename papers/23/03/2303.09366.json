    "translated_abstract": "药物治疗通常对患者的日常活动施加时间约束。违反医学时间约束（MTC）会导致缺乏治疗依从性，以及不良的健康结果和增加的医疗费用。这些MTC在患者教育材料和临床文本中的药物使用指南（DUGs）中被发现。通过在计算上表示DUGs中的MTC，将有助于通过帮助定义安全的患者活动模式来推进以患者为中心的医疗应用。我们定义了一种新颖的在DUGs中发现的MTC分类法，并开发了一种基于上下文无关文法（CFG）的模型来计算地表示MTC。此外，我们发布了三个新的数据集，共计N = 836个带标准化的MTC标记的DUGs。我们开发了一种上下文学习（ICL）解决方案，用于自动提取和标准化DUGs中发现的MTC，跨所有数据集实现了平均F1得分0.62。最后，我们对ICL模型进行了严格的研究。",
