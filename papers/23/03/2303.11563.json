    "translated_abstract": "随着医院向自动化和集成他们的计算系统，越来越多的精细化医院运营数据变得可用。这些数据包括医院建筑图纸，患者和医护人员之间的交互日志，处方数据，程序数据以及关于患者入院、出院和转移的数据。这为改善患者护理开辟了许多迷人的可能性。然而，为了利用现成的机器学习软件进行这些任务，我们需要从异构的、动态的数据流中学习涉及实体的结构表示。在这里，我们提出了DECTEN，一种自动编码异构共同演化的动态神经网络，用于从各种数据流中学习患者、医生、房间和药物的异构动态嵌入。这些嵌入基于静态属性和动态行为捕捉医生、房间、患者和药物之间的相似性，并可用于各种预测任务，如药物推荐、患者风险分层和医院容量管理。",
