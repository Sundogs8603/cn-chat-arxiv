    "abstract": "The Diproche system is an automated proof checker for texts written in a controlled fragment of German, designed for didactical applications in classes introducing students to proofs for the first time. The first version of the system used a controlled natural language for which a Prolog formalization routine was written. In this paper, we explore the possibility of prompting large language models for autoformalization in the context of Diproche, with encouraging first results.",
