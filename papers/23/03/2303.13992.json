    "abstract": "Recent studies reveal that Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) can be manipulated by hidden backdoors, causing them to perform harmful actions when activated by physical triggers. However, it is still unclear how these triggers can be activated while adhering to traffic principles. Understanding this vulnerability in a dynamic traffic environment is crucial. This work addresses this gap by presenting physical trigger activation as a reachability problem of controlled dynamic system. Our technique identifies security-critical areas in traffic systems where trigger conditions for accidents can be reached, and provides intended trajectories for how those conditions can be reached. Testing on typical traffic scenarios showed the system can be successfully driven to trigger conditions with near 100% activation rate. Our method benefits from identifying AV vulnerability and enabling effective safety strategies.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究揭示了自动驾驶汽车（AV）可能被隐藏的后门操纵，导致它们在被物理触发器激活时执行有害操作。然而，仍不清楚这些触发器如何在遵守交通规则的情况下被激活。在动态交通环境中了解这种漏洞是至关重要的。本研究通过将物理触发器激活视为可控动态系统的可达性问题来填补这一空白。我们的技术识别交通系统中的安全关键区域，可以到达事故触发条件，并提供到达这些条件的意图轨迹。在典型交通场景中的测试表明，该系统可以成功地推动触发器条件，触发率接近100％。我们的方法有助于识别AV的脆弱性，并启用有效的安全策略。",
