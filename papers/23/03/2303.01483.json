The method is rooted in well-established techniques for approximating the Koopman operator from data and is implemented as a semidefinite program that can be solved numerically. Furthermore, the method is agnostic of whether data is generated through a deterministic or stochastic process, so its implementation requires no prior adjustments by the user to accommodate these different scenarios. Rigorous convergence results justify the applicability of the method, while also extending and uniting similar results from across the literature. Examples on discovering Lyapunov functions, performing ergodic optimization, and bounding extrema over attractors for both deterministic and stochastic dynamics exemplify these convergence results and demonstrate the performance of the method.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种灵活的基于数据的动力系统分析方法，不需要明确的模型发现。该方法源于从数据中逼近Koopman算子的技术，并且以一个可以通过数值求解的半定规划问题来实现。此外，该方法不关心数据是通过确定性还是随机过程生成的，因此用户无需进行任何调整即可应用于不同的情况。严格的收敛性结果证明了该方法的适用性，并将文献中类似的结果进行了扩展和统一。通过对确定性和随机动力学的吸引子上发现Lyapunov函数、执行遍历优化以及界定极值的示例，证明了该方法的性能。",
