    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT是由OpenAI开发的尖端人工智能语言模型，因其惊人的回答跟进问题的能力而受到了很多关注。本文旨在评估ChatGPT在语法错误修正任务中的表现，并将其与商业GEC产品（例如Grammarly）和最先进的模型（例如GECToR）进行比较。通过在CoNLL2014基准数据集上的测试，我们发现ChatGPT在自动评估指标（如$F_{0.5}$得分）方面的表现不如那些基线，特别是在长句中。我们检查了输出结果，发现ChatGPT不仅进行单个修正，还更喜欢通过改变某些短语或句子结构的表达方式来保持语法上的正确性。人类评估量化地证实了这一点，并表明ChatGPT产生的欠修正或误修正问题较少，但过修正的问题较多。这些结果说明",
