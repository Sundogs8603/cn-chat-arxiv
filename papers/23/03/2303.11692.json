    "abstract": "Deep learning based methods have become a paradigm for cover song identification (CSI) in recent years, where the ByteCover systems have achieved state-of-the-art results on all the mainstream datasets of CSI. However, with the burgeon of short videos, many real-world applications require matching short music excerpts to full-length music tracks in the database, which is still under-explored and waiting for an industrial-level solution. In this paper, we upgrade the previous ByteCover systems to ByteCover3 that utilizes local features to further improve the identification performance of short music queries. ByteCover3 is designed with a local alignment loss (LAL) module and a two-stage feature retrieval pipeline, allowing the system to perform CSI in a more precise and efficient way. We evaluated ByteCover3 on multiple datasets with different benchmark settings, where ByteCover3 beat all the compared methods including its previous versions.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于深度学习的方法已成为翻唱歌曲识别(CSI)的范例，其中ByteCover系统在所有主流CSI数据集上取得了最新的成果。然而，随着短视频的兴起，许多真实应用需要将短音乐片段与数据库中的完整音乐轨道相匹配，这仍然是一个未被充分探索的问题，需要等待工业级解决方案。在本文中，我们将之前的ByteCover系统升级为ByteCover3，利用局部特征进一步提高短音乐查询的识别性能。ByteCover3设计了一个局部对齐损失(LAL)模块和一个两阶段特征检索管道，使系统能够以更精确和高效的方式进行CSI。我们在多个数据集上使用不同的基准设置对ByteCover3进行了评估，其中ByteCover3击败了所有比较的方法，包括其以前的版本。",
