    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了多个强化学习最优执行交易智能体与在事件时间下的反应式基于智能体的金融市场模型的动态和相互作用。模型代表了一个市场生态系统，由三个营养级别代表：最优执行学习智能体，最小智能的流动性需要者和快速的电子流动性提供者。最优执行代理类别包括买入和卖出代理，可以使用限价单和市价单的组合，或者仅使用市价单进行交易。奖励函数明确平衡了交易执行差价与未能及时执行订单的惩罚之间的关系。本文展示了多个竞争学习智能体如何随着智能体数量、初始订单的大小和用于学习的状态空间的函数影响最小智能市场模拟。我们使用相空间图来研究ABM的动态，当特定规范被应用",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces the interactions between multiple reinforcement learning optimal execution trading agents and a reactive Agent-Based Model of a financial market. By balancing execution slippage and the penalty of not executing orders timeously, the reward function is explained. The research shows how changes in the number of learning agents, initial order size, and state space impact the minimal intelligent market simulation."
