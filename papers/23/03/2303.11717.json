    "translated_title": "生成型AI（AIGC）完整调研：ChatGPT从GPT-4到GPT-5是你需要的全部吗？",
    "translated_abstract": "随着ChatGPT的流行，生成型AI（AIGC，即AI生成的内容）因其分析和创造文本、图像等能力而在各个领域引起轰动。在如此广泛的媒体报导下，几乎不可能错过从特定角度窥探AIGC的机会。在AI从纯粹的分析转向创造的时代，值得注意的是，ChatGPT仅仅是众多AIGC任务中的一个工具，其最新的语言模型GPT-4。许多人对ChatGPT的能力印象深刻，同时也在思考它的局限性：GPT-5（或其他未来的GPT变种）是否能帮助ChatGPT统一各种AIGC任务，实现多样化的内容创造？为了回答这个问题，需要进行现有AIGC任务的全面审查。因此，我们的工作迅速填补了这一空白，首次介绍了AIGC，涵盖了从技术到应用的所有方面。现代的生成型AI依赖于各种技术基础，包括模型架构等。",
    "tldr": "本文通过完整的调研介绍了生成型AI，包含了从技术到应用的各个方面。ChatGPT虽然是一个有用的工具，但并不足以覆盖所有的AIGC任务，对于实现多样化的内容创造还需要GPT-5等未来的发展。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a comprehensive survey of generative AI (AIGC), covering various aspects from techniques to applications. Although ChatGPT is a useful tool, it is not enough to cover all AIGC tasks for diversified content creation. Future developments such as GPT-5 are needed."
