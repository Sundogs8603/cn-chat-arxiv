    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能和数据挖掘技术的兴起，群体分析和群体层面的分析在包括政策制定和直接营销在内的许多领域中得到了越来越广泛的应用。在一些情况下，从数据中提取的统计信息可能为一个群体的共同特征提供见解；而在其他情况下，群体层面的分析可能会导致刻板印象和系统性压迫。分析工具如何促进更加有意识的群体分析过程？在本研究中，我们确定了一组负责任的群体分析设计指南，以阐明群体差异的需要和防止对群体的过度概括。遵循这些设计指南，我们开发了TribalGram，这是一个利用可解释的机器学习算法和可视化来提供推断评估、模型解释、数据协作和理解的视觉分析工具。通过与领域专家的访谈，我们展示了我们的设计和工具如何带来对分析群体的更深入理解，并防止由于刻板印象和过度概括而带来的潜在危害。",
