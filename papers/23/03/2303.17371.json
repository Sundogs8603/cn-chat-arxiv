    "translated_abstract": "基于内容的时尚图像检索在我们的日常生活中广泛使用，用于从在线平台上搜索时尚图像或商品。在电子商务购买中，当消费者上传参考图像、带文本的图像、草图或来自日常生活的视觉流时，CBFIR系统可以检索具有相同或可比特征的时尚商品或产品。这降低了CBFIR系统对文本的依赖性，允许更准确直接地搜索所需的时尚产品。考虑到最近的发展，由于多个时尚物品的同时可用性、时尚产品的遮挡和形状变形，CBFIR在现实世界中的视觉搜索仍存在局限性。本文重点介绍了基于图像、带文本的图像、草图和视频的CBFIR方法。因此，我们将CBFIR方法分为四类，即基于图像的CBFIR（增加属性和样式），图像和文本引导、草图引导和视频引导的CBFIR。在本综述文章中，我们总结了CBFIR的最新研究，对CBFIR方法进行了分类，并描述了CBFIR研究中常用的数据集和评估措施。",
