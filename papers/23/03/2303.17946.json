    "translated_abstract": "社交蜜罐是在线社交网络中部署的工具，用于吸引垃圾邮件和机器人执行的恶意活动。为此，它们的内容被设计成对恶意用户最感兴趣。然而，通过选择合适的内容主题，这种吸引机制可以扩展到任何在线社交网络用户，而不仅是吸引恶意用户。因此，蜜罐可以用于吸引对广泛主题感兴趣的个人，从体育和爱好到更敏感的政治观点和阴谋论。有了所有这些个人聚集在同一个地方，蜜罐所有者可以进行许多分析，从社交到市场研究。在这项工作中，我们引入了一个新颖的社交蜜罐概念，用于吸引对通用目标主题感兴趣的在线社交网络用户。我们提出了一个基于完全自动化的内容生成策略和参与计划的框架，以模拟合法的Instagram页面。为了验证我们的框架，我们在Instagram上创建了21个自我管理的社交蜜罐，侧重于21个不同的主题，从科技到生活方式，并总共获得了3,592个有机粉丝。通过这些社交蜜罐，我们收集了社交数据，用户行为和参与度指标。此外，我们还测试了我们蜜罐吸引具有不同兴趣和背景的用户的有效性。我们的框架提供了一种完全自动化，经济实惠和可扩展的方法，用于社交数据收集和研究目的。",
