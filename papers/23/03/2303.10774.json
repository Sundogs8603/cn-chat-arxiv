    "translated_abstract": "生成对抗网络（GAN）特别是在复杂分布和有限数据情况下，训练难度极大。这促使了对已训练网络进行审计的需求，以便以人类可理解的格式识别偏见或确保公平性。现有的GAN审计工具仅限于基于总结统计信息（如FID或召回率）的粗粒度模型-数据比较。本文提出了一种新的方法，即与之前的基线GAN相比较的途径。为此，我们引入了跨GAN审核（xGA），该方法联合识别出可理解的属性，这些属性可以是两个GAN共有的，是客户端GAN的新颖属性，或者是客户端GAN缺少的属性。这为用户和模型开发人员提供了直观的GAN相似性和差异性评估。我们引入了新的指标来评估基于属性的GAN审核方法，并使用这些指标来比较现有的审计方法。",
