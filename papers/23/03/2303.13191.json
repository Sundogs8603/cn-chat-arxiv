    "translated_abstract": "在数据挖掘中，检测给定数据集中相关模式的集合是一个重要的挑战。模式的相关性（也称为效用）是一个主观的度量，可以从非常不同的角度进行评估。基于规则的语言（如答案集编程）似乎很适合以约束形式规定用户提供的准则来评估模式效用；此外，答案集编程的声明性使得可以非常容易地在不同角度分析数据集。本文介绍了扩展高效用模式挖掘的新方法，特别是引入了新的框架，可以处理以前文献中未考虑的新型效用准则类。我们还展示了如何利用最近引入的带有外部函数的答案集编程扩展来支持一种快速有效的编码和测试新框架。我们展示了该框架的潜力，并且将其与现有的HUPM算法进行了比较。此外，我们提供了实际应用的示例，说明了我们的框架可用于高效准确的模式挖掘。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an extended framework for high utility pattern mining (HUPM) based on answer set programming (ASP), which supports new classes of utility criteria and allows for easy analysis of datasets from different perspectives. The proposed framework outperforms existing HUPM algorithms and has important applications in real-world scenarios."
