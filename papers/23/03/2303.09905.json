    "abstract": "The schema-guided paradigm overcomes scalability issues inherent in building task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents with static ontologies. Instead of operating on dialogue context alone, agents have access to hierarchical schemas containing task-relevant natural language descriptions. Fine-tuned language models excel at schema-guided dialogue state tracking (DST) but are sensitive to the writing style of the schemas. We explore methods for improving the robustness of DST models. We propose a framework for generating synthetic schemas which uses tree-based ranking to jointly optimise lexical diversity and semantic faithfulness. The generalisation of strong baselines is improved when augmenting their training data with prompts generated by our framework, as demonstrated by marked improvements in average joint goal accuracy (JGA) and schema sensitivity (SS) on the SGD-X benchmark.",

    "translated_abstract": "模式引导范式通过包含任务相关的自然语言描述的层次结构模式，克服了使用静态本体构建面向任务的对话（TOD）代理时存在的可扩展性问题。精细调整的语言模型在模式引导对话状态追踪（DST）方面表现出色，但对模式的书写风格很敏感。本文探讨了提高DST模型稳健性的方法。我们提出了一个框架来生成使用基于树形排名的合成模式，以共同优化词汇多样性和语义忠实度。实验结果表明，在SGD-X基准测试中，使用我们的框架生成提示来增加其训练数据后，强基线的泛化能力得到了提高，平均联合目标准确率（JGA）和模式灵敏度（SS）均有显着提升。",
