    "translated_abstract": "不完整多视图聚类（Incomplete multi-view clustering，IMVC）是一种无监督的方法，其中通过对比学习的IMVC由于其出色的性能而受到关注。现有的方法存在以下问题：1）在解决聚类期间潜在特征只在低维子空间有效的维度崩塌问题时过度依赖额外的投影头；但是，投影头中的许多参数是不必要的。2）恢复的视图包含不一致的私有信息，并且由于在同一特征上执行一致性学习和重构学习，无用的私有信息将误导常见语义的学习。为解决以上问题，我们提出了一种新的不完整多视图对比聚类框架。该框架直接优化潜在特征子空间，利用学习到的特征向量及其子向量进行重构学习和一致性学习，从而有效避免了维度崩塌，并降低了不一致私有信息的影响。在四个真实世界的数据集上的实验验证了我们模型的有效性。",
