    "translated_abstract": "康复锻炼在卒中后患者的康复过程中扮演着至关重要的角色。通过个性化治疗和电子健康记录，医疗保健提供者可以使康复过程更加高效。在预测建模为患者分配治疗计划之前，自动化方法是从非结构化电子健康记录中提取康复锻炼信息所必需的。我们引入了一个基于规则的自然语言处理算法来注释卒中患者的治疗过程，并将其与几个小型机器学习模型进行比较。我们发现，在足够的数据可用的情况下，我们的算法在提取一半的概念方面优于这些模型，并且每个概念的个体运动描述可以分配二进制标签，并且F值不低于0.75。在这些算法可以部署到无标签文档之前，需要进行更多的研究，但定制的基于规则的自然语言处理算法表现出了准确提取临床笔记中康复治疗锻炼信息的前景。",
