    "translated_abstract": "主动学习和半监督学习是两种通过使用少量标记数据和大量未标记数据来降低深度学习成本的技术。为了通过更低的成本提高模型的准确性，我们提出了一种称为主动半监督学习（ASSL）的方法，它结合了主动学习和半监督学习。为了最大化主动学习和半监督学习之间的协同作用，我们专注于ASSL和主动学习之间的差异。由于在训练过程中使用未标记数据，ASSL比主动学习涉及更多的动态模型更新，这导致未标记数据的预测概率存在时间不稳定性。这使得在ASSL中确定未标记数据的真实不确定性变得困难。为了解决这个问题，我们采用了强化学习中使用的指数移动平均（EMA）和上置信界（UCB）等技术。此外，我们通过使用弱和强数据扩充来分析标签噪声对无监督学习的影响。",
