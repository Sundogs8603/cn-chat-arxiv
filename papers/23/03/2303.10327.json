    "translated_abstract": "混合系统在机器人技术中广泛应用。然而，由于连续和离散动态的复杂性，确保混合系统的稳定性具有挑战性。即使一个具有所有系统模式稳定的系统仍然可能是不稳定的。因此，在模式切换时需要特殊处理以稳定系统。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种分层的、基于神经网络（NN）的控制一般混合系统的方法。对于每个系统模式，我们首先学习NN Lyapunov函数和NN控制器，以确保在吸引子区域（RoA）内的状态可以被稳定地控制。然后在不同模式之间学习RoA NN估计器。在模式切换时，我们提出了一个可微的规划器，以确保切换后的状态可以落入下一个模式的RoA中，从而稳定混合系统。我们提供了新颖的理论稳定性保证，并在汽车跟踪控制、pogobot导航和双足行走机器人运动中进行实验。与传统方法相比，我们的方法只需要0.25倍的训练时间即可找到Lyapunov函数，并且可以实现类似或更好的性能。",
