    "translated_abstract": "尽管人工智能（AI）系统已被证明能提高黑色素瘤的初步诊断准确性，但这些系统在如何识别黑素瘤方面缺乏透明度，这给用户接受带来了严重障碍。可解释的人工智能（XAI）方法可以增加透明度，但大多数XAI方法无法产生明确定位的领域特定解释，使得解释难以解释。此外，XAI方法对皮肤科医生的影响尚未评估。我们扩展了两个现有分类器，开发了一种XAI系统，该系统在不同诊断的基础上产生了文本和区域解释，这些解释容易被皮肤科医生解释。为了评估此系统，我们进行了一个三部分的读者研究，以评估其对临床医生的诊断准确性、信心和对XAI支持的信任的影响。我们证明我们的XAI解释与医生的解释高度一致。",
