    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界中运作的自主代理通常要处理部分可观测性，而这通常被建模为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）。然而，传统的 POMDP 模型依赖于完全知识观测源的假设，即完全可观测数据关联。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一种规划算法，它维护多个数据关联假设，表示为信念混合，其中每个组件对应于不同的数据关联假设。然而，这种方法可能导致假设数量呈指数增长，从而导致显著的计算开销。为了克服这一挑战，我们引入了一种基于剪枝的方法来处理具有不确定数据关联的规划。我们的主要贡献在于基于完整假设集与基于假设剪枝子集的价值函数之间导出界限，从而使我们能够建立使用修剪的假设子集所造成的最大损失的紧密上界。我们的方法在具有挑战性的自主驾驶场景中进行评估，并展示了显著的计算节省，同时保持合理的性能保证。",
