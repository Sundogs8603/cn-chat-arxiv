A Deep Q-Network is trained in simulation to serve as a central decision-making unit by proposing targets for a trajectory planner. The generated trajectories in combination with a controller for longitudinal movement are used to execute lane change maneuvers. In order to prove the functionality of this approach it is evaluated on two different highway traffic scenarios.
