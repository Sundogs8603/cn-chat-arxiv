    "translated_abstract": "Zipf缩写定律指的是更常见的单词更短，是语言普遍性的最坚实的候选者，它有可能是没有例外或者例外非常少的语言普遍性。自从Zipf的开创性研究以来，这一定律一直被认为是通信的普遍原理的表现，即通过缩短词汇长度来减少通信的努力。在这里，我们重新审视了书面语与缩写定律之间的一致性。关键地，我们提供更广泛的证据，表明这一定律也适用于口语（当用时间来测量词汇长度时），特别是适用于来自14个语言家族的46种语言。与缩写定律的一致性提供了压缩语言的间接证据，这是通过理论论证得出的，即缩写定律是最优编码的预测。鉴于需要直接证据来证明压缩，我们通过英语的历史研究发现，人们在语言中实际使用的词汇数量正在缩减。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper revisits the concordance of written language with the law of abbreviation and provides wider evidence that the law holds also in speech. The agreement with the law of abbreviation provides indirect evidence of compression of languages, and the study also reveals that the number of words actually used in language is declining, based on historical research of English."
