    "abstract": "Recent years have seen growing adoption of AI-based decision-support systems (ADS) in homeless services, yet we know little about stakeholder desires and concerns surrounding their use. In this work, we aim to understand impacted stakeholders' perspectives on a deployed ADS that prioritizes scarce housing resources. We employed AI lifecycle comicboarding, an adapted version of the comicboarding method, to elicit stakeholder feedback and design ideas across various components of an AI system's design. We elicited feedback from county workers who operate the ADS daily, service providers whose work is directly impacted by the ADS, and unhoused individuals in the region. Our participants shared concerns and design suggestions around the AI system's overall objective, specific model design choices, dataset selection, and use in deployment. Our findings demonstrate that stakeholders, even without AI knowledge, can provide specific and critical feedback on an AI system's design and deployment",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于人工智能的决策支持系统（ADS）在无家可归者服务中得到了广泛应用，但我们对于涉及该技术的利益相关方的愿望和关注知之甚少。在这项研究中，我们旨在了解受影响利益相关方对一个优先考虑有限住房资源的 ADS 的看法。我们采用了 AI 生命周期漫画板设计方法的改进版本进行反馈搜集和设计思路收集跨 AI 系统设计的各个组成部分。我们从每日操作 ADS 的县工作人员，直接受到 ADS 影响的服务提供者以及该地区的无家可归个体中获取反馈。我们的参与者分享了对 AI 系统的整体目标、特定模型设计选择、数据集选择以及在部署中使用的关注和设计建议。我们的发现表明，利益相关方即使没有 AI 知识，也能提供对于 AI 系统设计和部署的具体和关键性反馈。",
