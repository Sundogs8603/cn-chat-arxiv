Most existing studies focus on the behavior of stand-alone single-agent learners. In comparison, this work studies adversarial training over graphs, where individual agents are subjected to perturbations of varied strength levels across space. It is expected that interactions by linked agents, and the heterogeneity of the attack models that are possible over the graph, can help enhance robustness in view of the coordination power of the group. Using a min-max formulation of diffusion learning, we develop a decentralized adversarial training framework for multi-agent systems. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed scheme for both convex and non-convex environments, and illustrate the enhanced robustness to adversarial attacks.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，机器学习模型对抗攻击的漏洞引起了广泛关注。大多数现有研究都集中在独立单一代理学习者的行为上。相比之下，本文研究了在图上的对抗性训练，其中各个单独的代理会受到空间中不同强度的扰动。预期通过链接代理和可能在图上实现的攻击模型的异质性，协调整个团队的强大协同作用可以帮助增强鲁棒性。本文使用扩散学习的极小-极大公式，为多代理系统开发了一种去中心化的对抗性训练框架。我们分析了该方案在凸和非凸环境下的收敛特性，并说明了增强的鲁棒性对抗攻击。",
