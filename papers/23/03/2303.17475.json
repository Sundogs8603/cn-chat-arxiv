    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种高效的学习分布式表示（也称为嵌入）的方法。该方法通过最小化一个类似于Word2Vec算法中引入并在多个工作中采用的目标函数来实现。优化计算的瓶颈是softmax归一化常数的计算，这需要与样本大小呈二次比例的操作数。这种复杂度不适用于大型数据集，所以负采样是一个常见的解决方法，可以在与样本大小线性相关的时间内获得分布式表示。然而，负采样会改变损失函数，因此解决的是与最初提出的不同的优化问题。我们的贡献在于展示如何通过线性时间估计softmax归一化常数，从而设计了一种有效的优化策略来学习分布式表示。我们使用不同的数据集进行测试，并展示了我们的方法在嵌入质量和训练时间方面优于负采样。",
