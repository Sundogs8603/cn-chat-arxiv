    "abstract": "This paper reports on our initial evaluation of The Equitable AI Research Roundtable -- a coalition of experts in law, education, community engagement, social justice, and technology. EARR was created in collaboration among a large tech firm, nonprofits, NGO research institutions, and universities to provide critical research based perspectives and feedback on technology's emergent ethical and social harms. Through semi-structured workshops and discussions within the large tech firm, EARR has provided critical perspectives and feedback on how to conceptualize equity and vulnerability as they relate to AI technology. We outline three principles in practice of how EARR has operated thus far that are especially relevant to the concerns of the FAccT community: how EARR expands the scope of expertise in AI development, how it fosters opportunities for epistemic curiosity and responsibility, and that it creates a space for mutual learning. This paper serves as both an analysis and translatio",

    "translated_abstract": "本文报道了我们对平等AI研究圆桌会议（EARR）的初步评估 —— 一个由法律、教育、社区参与、社会正义和技术专家组成的联盟。EARR是由大型科技公司、非营利组织、NGO研究机构和大学合作创建的，旨在提供关于技术新兴的道德和社会伤害的关键研究视角和反馈。通过半结构化的研讨会和在大型科技公司中的讨论，EARR提供了关于如何将公平和脆弱性与AI技术相关联的关键观点和反馈。我们概述了EARR迄今为止操作的三个原则，这些原则与FAccT社区的关注特别相关：如何扩大AI开发中的专业知识范围，如何促进知识好奇心和责任，以及如何创造相互学习的空间。本文既是分析又是翻译。",
