We analyze equilibrium housing prices in an overlapping generations model with perfect housing and rental markets. We prove that the economy exhibits a two-stage phase transition: as the income of home buyers rises, the equilibrium regime changes from fundamental only to coexistence of fundamental and bubbly equilibria. With even higher incomes, fundamental equilibria disappear and housing bubbles become inevitable. Expectation-driven housing booms containing a bubble and their collapse can occur. Contrary to widely-held beliefs, fundamental equilibria in the coexistence region are inefficient despite housing being a productive non-reproducible asset.",

    "translated_abstract": "根据实证观察到的租售价格比，表明基本面与房价存在断层。本文在一个存在完美住房和租赁市场的交叉世代模型中分析平衡的房价。我们证明经济体呈现出二阶段相变：随着购房者收入的增加，平衡制度从仅基本面到基本面和泡沫平衡共存发生了转变。当购房者收入更高时，基本面均衡消失，房地产泡沫变得不可避免。包含泡沫的预期推动房地产繁荣以及它们的崩溃可能会发生。与广为人知的相反，尽管房产是一种生产性的不可再生资产，但固有基本面均衡是低效的。",

It also shows that housing bubbles become inevitable with even higher incomes and expectation-driven housing booms and their collapse can occur, and that fundamental equilibria in the coexistence region are inefficient despite housing being a productive non-reproducible asset."
