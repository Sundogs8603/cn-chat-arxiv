    "translated_abstract": "在语音合成中，生成对抗网络（GAN）被广泛用于提高语音质量，该网络训练生成器（语音合成器）和鉴别器，使它们在一个极小极大博弈中协同对抗。近期的神经语音编码器（例如HiFi-GAN）和端到端的文本到语音系统（例如VITS）通常使用多个鉴别器的集合来从多个角度仔细地检查波形。这种鉴别器可以使合成语音充分接近实际语音，但是随着鉴别器数量的增加，需要增加模型大小和计算时间。相反，本研究提出了一种Wave-U-Net鉴别器，这是一个单独的但具有Wave-U-Net架构的表达力强的鉴别器。这个鉴别器独特之处在于，它可以以与输入信号相同的分辨率以逐个样本的方式评估波形，同时通过编码器和解码器提取多级特征，并使用跳跃连接。这种架构为生成器提供了足够的信息，",
