The generated music has coherence at time scales up to the length of the training piano-roll segments. We show how such a model is conditioned on the input and can be used to harmonize a given melody, complete an incomplete piano-roll or generate a variation of a given piece.

    "translated_abstract": "概率去噪扩散模型已成为简单而强大的生成模型。与其他生成模型不同，扩散模型不会出现模式崩溃，也不需要辨别器来生成高质量样本。本文提出了一种使用二项先验分布来生成钢琴卷帘的扩散模型。本文还提出了一种高效的方法来训练模型和生成样本。生成的音乐具有时间尺度上的一致性，可以达到训练钢琴卷帘段的长度。我们展示了这样一个模型是如何在输入的条件下进行工作，并可用于协调给定的旋律，完成不完整的钢琴卷帘或生成给定乐曲的变化。代码是公开共享的，以鼓励社区使用和开发该方法。",
