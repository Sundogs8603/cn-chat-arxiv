    "translated_abstract": "数据评估是研究训练实例对于给定预测任务价值的机器学习领域。虽然数据偏见是下游模型不公平的主要来源之一，但以往的数据评估工作并未考虑训练实例如何影响机器学习模型的性能和公平性。因此，我们提出了一种公平感知数据评估（FADO）框架，该框架可用于将公平性考虑纳入一系列与机器学习相关的任务中（例如数据预处理、探索性数据分析、主动学习）。我们提出了基于熵的数据评估指标，适用于解决我们的两个目标：最大化性能和公平性。该指标比现有指标更具计算效率。然后，我们展示了如何将FADO应用为不公平性缓解预处理技术的基础。我们的方法取得了有希望的结果——与基线相比，在性能损失小于1 p.p.的情况下，公平性提高了多达40 p.p.。",
