    "translated_abstract": "在危险情境中的多智能体系统（MAS）中，基础的关系可以被表示成博弈论模型。本文提出了一种新的基于网络的分层模型，称为博弈论实用树（GUT），它将高层次策略分解为可执行的低层次动作，以实现合作MAS决策。它结合了一种基于代理需求的实时策略游戏的新收益度量。我们在Explore游戏领域中，从平衡成功概率和系统成本的角度衡量了MAS的绩效，评估了GUT方法相对于贪心地依赖于组合动作奖励的最新方法。广泛的数值模拟的确定结果表明GUT可以组织更复杂的MAS协作关系，帮助团队以更低的成本和更高的获胜率实现具有挑战性的任务。此外，我们演示了使用模拟应用GUT的可行性。",
