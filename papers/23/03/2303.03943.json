    "translated_abstract": "当前探索和监测复杂的水下生态系统（如珊瑚礁）的方法是使用潜水员手持或静态相机进行调查，或者部署传感器浮标。这些方法通常无法捕捉不同珊瑚礁生物及其栖息地之间相互作用的全部变化和复杂性。本文介绍了CUREE平台，它通过机器人行为和感知算法提供了一组独特的能力，使科学家能够探索生态系统的不同方面。这些能力的示例包括低空视觉调查、声景调查、栖息地表征和动物跟踪。我们通过描述在美国维尔京群岛的珊瑚礁上进行的两次实地部署来展示这些能力。在第一次部署中，我们展示了CUREE可以通过视觉调查、栖息地表征和声景调查相结合的方式，识别出珊瑚礁中拍摄虾的首选栖息地类型。在第二次部署中，我们展示了CUREE追踪和跟踪一群觅食的外科医生鱼并收集其行为数据的能力。",
