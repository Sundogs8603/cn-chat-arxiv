In this paper, we invite survey methodologists to begin using and contributing to conformal methods. We introduce how conformal prediction can be applied to data from several common complex sample survey designs, under a framework of design-based inference for a finite population, and we point out gaps where survey methodologists could fruitfully apply their expertise.

    "translated_abstract": "符合性预测是一种不依赖于假设的方法，用于生成无分布的预测区间或集合，适用于几乎任何预测模型，并且具有保证的有限样本覆盖率。符合性方法在统计和机器学习中是一个活跃的研究主题，但近期才被扩展到非可交换数据上。在本文中，我们邀请调查方法学家开始使用和贡献符合性方法。我们介绍了如何将符合性预测应用于几种常见的复杂样本调查设计数据上，通过有限总体设计推断的框架，同时指出调查方法学家可以有益地应用其专业知识的领域。我们的模拟实验从经验上验证了有限样本覆盖率的理论保证，我们的实际数据示例展示了符合性预测如何在实践中应用于复杂样本调查数据。",
