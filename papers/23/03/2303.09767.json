    "abstract": "Adversarial examples are inputs to machine learning models that an attacker has intentionally designed to confuse the model into making a mistake. Such examples pose a serious threat to the applicability of machine-learning-based systems, especially in life- and safety-critical domains. To address this problem, the area of adversarial robustness investigates mechanisms behind adversarial attacks and defenses against these attacks. This survey reviews literature that focuses on the effects of data used by a model on the model's adversarial robustness. It systematically identifies and summarizes the state-of-the-art research in this area and further discusses gaps of knowledge and promising future research directions.",
