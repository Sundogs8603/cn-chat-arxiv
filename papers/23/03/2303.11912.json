    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络（DNN）在超出分布范围的场景下经常会出现失败。本文提出了一个工具来可视化和理解这种失败。我们从神经电生理学的概念中汲取灵感，通过分析单个神经元的特征调谐和不变性，来检查神经网络的内部功能。Deep Electrophysiology，简称Deephys，通过比较可视化内分布和外分布数据集中的神经活动，提供了有关DNN在超出分布范围的场景中失败的见解。Deephys提供了对单个神经元，单个图像以及类别图像集的无缝分析，并且能够揭示由于假特征和新特征的存在而导致的失败。我们通过在几个数据集和分布漂移中使用卷积神经网络和变换器架构进行数量分析，证实了Deephys的定性可视化的有效性。",
