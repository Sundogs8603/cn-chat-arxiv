    "translated_abstract": "任务导向的对话系统使用户能够使用自然语言完成任务。现有技术的系统无论用户如何，都会用相同的方式回应，但是自定义对话可能会提高采用率和更好的用户体验。构建个性化对话系统是一项重要但具有挑战性的任务，只有少数几项工作面对了这一挑战。大部分现有工作依赖于监督学习方法，并需要每个用户资料进行繁琐和昂贵的标记训练数据。此外，为每个用户档案收集和标记数据几乎是不可能的。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的框架，P-ToD，通过零-shot泛化奖励函数，个性化任务导向的对话系统，适应了广泛的用户资料，以无监督的方式进行。我们的实验结果表明，在基准数据集上，P-ToD在任务成功率和用户满意度方面显著优于现有技术。",
