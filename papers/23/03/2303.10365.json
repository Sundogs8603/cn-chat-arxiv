    "abstract": "Partial-label learning (PLL) is an important weakly supervised learning problem, which allows each training example to have a candidate label set instead of a single ground-truth label. Identification-based methods have been widely explored to tackle label ambiguity issues in PLL, which regard the true label as a latent variable to be identified. However, identifying the true labels accurately and completely remains challenging, causing noise in pseudo labels during model training. In this paper, we propose a new method called CroSel, which leverages historical prediction information from models to identify true labels for most training examples. First, we introduce a cross selection strategy, which enables two deep models to select true labels of partially labeled data for each other. Besides, we propose a novel consistent regularization term called co-mix to avoid sample waste and tiny noise caused by false selection. In this way, CroSel can pick out the true labels of most examples ",

    "translated_abstract": "部分标签学习(PLL)是一个重要的弱监督学习问题，它允许每个训练示例有一个候选标签集，而不是一个单一的ground-truth标签。已经广泛探索了基于识别的方法来解决PLL中的标签歧义问题，这些方法将真实标签视为要识别的潜在变量。然而，准确和完整地识别真实标签仍然具有挑战性，这会在模型训练过程中导致伪标签中的噪声。本文提出了一种名为CroSel的新方法，该方法利用模型的历史预测信息来识别大多数训练示例的真实标签。首先，我们引入了一种交叉选择策略，使得两个深度模型可以相互选择部分标记数据的真实标签。此外，我们提出了一种新颖的一致性正则化项co-mix，以避免因虚假选择而引起的样本浪费和微小噪声。通过这种方式，CroSel能够挑选出大多数示例的真实标签。",
