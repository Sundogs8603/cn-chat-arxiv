    "translated_abstract": "人脸识别模型将人脸图像嵌入低维身份向量中，包含身份特征的抽象编码，这些特征允许区分个体。我们面临着在没有完全模型访问的情况下（即黑盒设置下）反向预训练人脸识别模型的潜在空间的挑战。已经有许多方法提出解决这个问题，但它们存在严重的缺陷，如缺乏现实输出、推理时间长以及对数据集和人脸识别模型的可访问性有强烈的要求。通过对黑盒反演问题的分析，我们展示了条件性扩散模型漏洞的自然涌现，并且即使没有身份特征的损失，我们也可以有效地从反向分布中进行采样。我们的方法名为身份去噪扩散概率模型（ID3PM），利用去噪扩散过程的随机性质来产生黑盒人脸识别模型的高度可控的反演。该方法能够生成逼真且多样的输出，使其适用于数据增强、对抗性攻击和生成个性化的训练数据等多种应用。",
