    "translated_abstract": "本文以Queer in AI为案例研究，探讨社区参与式AI设计的实践。我们分析了社区参与设计和交叉性原则如何在多年里在这个社群中萌芽和塑造了其项目。本文探讨了该组织在此过程中面临的不同挑战，审视了该组织在实现参与性与交叉性原则方面的不足，并评估了该组织的影响。Queer in AI通过拒绝等级制度而选择去中心化，通过将援助和项目建设建立在酷儿社群内部、由酷儿社群内成员来负责的方式，以及努力改变酷儿社群外的参与者和机构，为参与式方法的从业者和理论家提供了重要的经验和见解。最后，我们推测像Queer in AI这样的社区如何通过培育AI的参与文化，欢迎和赋权边缘化的参与者，批评贫瘠和剥削性表述等方面，为AI的参与式设计做出了更广泛的贡献。",
