    "translated_abstract": "动态磁共振成像(Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging, MRI)因其在诊断领域中对人体内部器官和组织的动态成像具有强大的可靠性而成为领先的诊断工具。然而，使用MRI进行高时空分辨率成像需要相对较长的采集时间(因此成本增加)，这导致出现相关的运动伪影并降低了分辨率。压缩感知(Compressed Sensing, CS)技术成为减少MRI采集时间的常用工具，通过按某些采集轨迹在k-空间中进行图像子采样。一些研究特别关注于应用深度学习技术学习这些采集轨迹，以实现更好的图像重建，而不是使用预定义的采集轨迹。据我们所知，学习采集轨迹只在静态MRI的情况下探索过。在本研究中，我们考虑了采集轨迹在动态MRI情况下的学习。",
