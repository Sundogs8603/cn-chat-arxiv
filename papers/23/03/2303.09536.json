    "translated_abstract": "遥感变化检测是从多时相遥感图像中检测相关变化，用于各种遥感应用，例如土地覆盖、土地利用、人类发展分析和灾难响应。现有的遥感变化检测方法的性能归因于大型注释数据集的训练。此外，大多数模型在培训和测试数据集之间存在领域差距时，训练的模型往往表现非常差。本文提出了一种基于深度度量学习的无监督CD方法，可以处理这两个问题。给定MT-RSI，所提出的方法通过迭代地优化无监督CD损失来生成对应的变化概率图，而不需要在大的数据集上进行训练。我们的无监督CD方法包含两个相互连接的深度网络，即Deep-Change Probability Generator（D-CPG）和Deep-Feature Extractor（D-FE）。D-CPG旨在通过学习判别特征来预测变化，而D-FE则用于提取用于变化检测的特征。实验结果表明，我们提出的方法在各种具有不同设置的数据集中优于几种最先进的无监督CD方法以及有监督的方法。",
