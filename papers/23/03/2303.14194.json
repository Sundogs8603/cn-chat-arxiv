    "translated_abstract": "许多传染病的传播都是用SIR隔室模型的变体进行建模的，该模型是一组耦合的微分方程。 SIR模型的系数确定了疾病传播轨迹，基于此可以采取积极措施。因此，系数估计必须既快又准确。Shaier等人在论文“疾病信息神经网络”中使用物理信息神经网络（PINNs）估计了SIR模型的参数。该方法有两个缺点。首先，PINN的训练时间很长，某些疾病需要接近90小时的训练时间。其次，PINN对于新的SIDR轨迹不具有普适性，学习其对应的SIR参数需要从头重新训练PINN。在这项工作中，我们旨在消除这两个缺点。我们通过使用LSODA算法解决参数和传播轨迹之间的正向问题来生成数据集。然后，我们使用深度神经网络（DNN）作为反演求解器，根据传播轨迹估计SIR模型的正确参数。我们提出的方法，DeepEpiSolver，比PINN方法快几个数量级，并且可以很好地推广到新的SIDR轨迹上。我们在四种不同的疾病上验证了我们的方法：Covid，HIV，Ebola和疾病传播。",
