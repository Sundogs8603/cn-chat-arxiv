    "translated_abstract": "生成式语言模型在2022年底和2023年初引起了广泛关注，尤其是引入了与用户期望的AI交互一致的模型（对话模型）。人们关注的焦点可以说是GPT3模型的这种改进——ChatGPT及其随后与辅助功能集成的应用，包括作为Microsoft Bing的搜索部分。尽管此前已经投入了大量研究进行开发，但它们在各种日常任务中的性能和适用性仍不清楚且狭窄。然而，他们的广泛应用并不需要技术专业知识，这在相当大的程度上是通过对话微调实现的，揭示了在实际环境中它们真实能力的范围。这引起了公众对其潜在应用的兴奋和对其能力及可能的恶意用途的担忧。本综述旨在提供生成式大语言模型的简要概述以及在网络防御中的应用。",
