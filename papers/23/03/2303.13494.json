    "abstract": "Attention is the crucial cognitive ability that limits and selects what information we observe. Previous work by Bolander et al. (2016) proposes a model of attention based on dynamic epistemic logic (DEL) where agents are either fully attentive or not attentive at all. While introducing the realistic feature that inattentive agents believe nothing happens, the model does not represent the most essential aspect of attention: its selectivity. Here, we propose a generalization that allows for paying attention to subsets of atomic formulas. We introduce the corresponding logic for propositional attention, and show its axiomatization to be sound and complete. We then extend the framework to account for inattentive agents that, instead of assuming nothing happens, may default to a specific truth-value of what they failed to attend to (a sort of prior concerning the unattended atoms). This feature allows for a more cognitively plausible representation of the inattentional blindness phenomenon",

    "translated_abstract": "注意力是限制和选择我们观察到的信息的关键认知能力。本文提出了一种基于动态认知逻辑（DEL）的注意力模型，其中代理人要么完全专注，要么完全不关注。我们提出了一种更一般化的模型，允许代理人关注一些原子公式的子集。我们介绍了命题注意力的相应逻辑，并证明了其公理系统的准确性和完备性。进一步地，我们扩展了该框架，以解释无注意瞎视现象。",
