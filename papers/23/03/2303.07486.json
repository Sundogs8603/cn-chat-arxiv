    "abstract": "High quality speech capture has been widely studied for both voice communication and human computer interface reasons. To improve the capture performance, we can often find multi-microphone speech enhancement techniques deployed on various devices. Multi-microphone speech enhancement problem is often decomposed into two decoupled steps: a beamformer that provides spatial filtering and a single-channel speech enhancement model that cleans up the beamformer output. In this work, we propose a speech enhancement solution that takes both the raw microphone and beamformer outputs as the input for an ML model. We devise a simple yet effective training scheme that allows the model to learn from the cues of the beamformer by contrasting the two inputs and greatly boost its capability in spatial rejection, while conducting the general tasks of denoising and dereverberation. The proposed solution takes advantage of classical spatial filtering algorithms instead of competing with them. By design, ",

    "translated_abstract": "为了提高语音采集的质量，多麦克风语音增强技术已被广泛研究。这篇论文提出了一种新的语音增强解决方案，将原始麦克风与波束形成器的输出均作为机器学习模型的输入。通过对比两个输入来训练模型，使模型从波束形成器的提示中学习，大大提高了模型的定向拒绝能力，同时还具有降噪和去混响等通用任务。该解决方案利用经典的空间滤波算法，而非与之竞争。",
