    "translated_abstract": "NFT（不可替代令牌）已经大幅增长，占据了总市值超过169亿美元。尽管NFT迅速增长，但这个市场还未从金融角度进行彻底的研究。本文对NFT市场进行了系统分析，以识别在潜在操纵和波动NFT价值方面发挥重要作用的NFT市场运动者。我们从2021年1月至2022年2月收集了来自以太坊区块链的超过380万次NFT交易数据，并提取了符合NFT生命周期的交易信息：（i）铸造，（ii）交易/销售和（iii）销毁。根据持有NFT价值的大小，我们将NFT交易者分为三个组别（鲸鱼，海豚和小鱼）。总共，我们分析了来自91个不同的NFT收藏来源的430K交易者。我们发现，NFT交易者中前0.1％的鲸鱼以一致的高回报推动NFT市场。然后，我们确定并描述了NFT鲸鱼的独特投资策略（例如，铸造/销售，购买/持有和参与IDO）。",
