    "translated_abstract": "本文提出神经衰弱机器（NFM），这是一个强大灵活的神经建模框架，用于生存回归。NFM框架利用生存分析中的多重衰弱的经典思想来捕捉个体间未观察到的异质性，并能够利用神经结构的强大逼近能力处理非线性协变量依赖性。框架下推导出两个具体模型，它们分别扩展了神经比例危险模型和非参数危险回归模型。这两个模型都允许在似然目标下进行高效训练。理论上，对于两个提出的模型，我们通过表征其收敛速率，建立了神经函数逼近非参数组件的统计保证。在实证上，我们提供了合成实验来验证我们的理论陈述。我们还在不同规模的6个基准数据集上进行了实验评估，显示出所提出的方法的优越性。",

Two specific models are derived under the framework, which extend neural proportional hazard models and nonparametric hazard regression models. Both models allow efficient training under the likelihood objective, and the statistical guarantees of neural function approximation are established. Empirical results show the superiority of the proposed method on 6 benchmark datasets of different scales."
