    "translated_title": "“不忘我”：文本到图像扩散模型中的遗忘学习",
    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型的遗忘问题曾一度是学术界的主要关注点，但如今已成为产业界的普遍问题。文本到图像生成技术的重大进展引发了全球对隐私、版权和安全的讨论，因为这些模型学习了大量未授权的个人身份、内容、艺术创作和潜在的有害物质，随后用于生成和分发无控制的内容。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了“不忘我”，这是一种高效、低成本的解决方案，旨在安全地从文本到图像模型中删除指定的身份、对象或样式，只需不到30秒的时间，而不会影响其生成其他内容的能力。在我们的方法之外，我们引入了“记忆分数 (M-Score)”和“概念基准 (ConceptBench)”来衡量模型生成通用概念的能力，分为三个主要类别：ID、对象和样式。使用M-Score和ConceptBench，我们对三种最先进的文本到图像模型的忘记我进行了广泛的评估，并展示了在记忆保留率、图像质量和推理速度等方面的有前途的结果。",
