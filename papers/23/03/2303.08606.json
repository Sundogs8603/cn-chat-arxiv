Most dialog response retrieval models output a single score for a response on how relevant it is to a given question. However, the bad calibration of deep neural network results in various uncertainty for the single score such that the unreliable predictions always misinform user decisions. To investigate these issues, we present an efficient calibration and uncertainty estimation framework PG-DRR for dialog response retrieval models which adds a Gaussian Process layer to a deterministic deep neural network and recovers conjugacy for tractable posterior inference by P\\'{o}lya-Gamma augmentation. Finally, PG-DRR achieves the lowest empirical calibration error (ECE) in the in-domain datasets and the distributional shift task while keeping $R_{10}@1$ and MAP performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度神经检索模型已经充分展示了它们的能力，但估计它们预测的可靠性仍然具有挑战性。大多数对话响应检索模型为每个响应输出一个相关问题的单个得分。然而，深度神经网络的坏校准会导致各种不确定性单个得分，从而不可靠的预测总是误导用户决策。为了研究这些问题，我们提出了一种高效的校准和不确定性估计框架PG-DRR，用于对话响应检索模型，它将一个高斯过程层添加到一个确定性深度神经网络中，并通过Polya-Gamma增强恢复共轭以便得到易处理的后验推断。最后，PG-DRR在域内数据集和分布偏移任务中实现了最低的实证校准误差（ECE），同时保持$R_{10}@1$和MAP性能。",
