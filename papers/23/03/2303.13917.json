    "translated_abstract": "本文探索了使用卷积神经网络（包括现代的ConvNeXt网络系列）来分类来自Advanced LIGO探测器的数据中的短暂噪声信号（即毛刺信号）和引力波。首先，我们使用监督学习方法的模型，使用Gravity Spy数据集从头开始训练和Fine-tune预训练模型。其次，我们还探索了一种自监督的方法，使用自动生成的伪标签预训练模型。我们的发现与同一数据集的现有结果非常接近，最佳的监督（自监督）模型的F1分数达到了97.18％（94.15％）。我们进一步使用LIGO-Virgo O3运行的实际引力波信号测试了模型。虽然是使用前几次运行 （O1和O2）的数据进行训练，但模型表现良好，特别是使用了迁移学习。我们发现，迁移学习可以提高分数，而无需大量的注释数据。我们的工作展示了卷积神经网络在分类引力波数据流中的毛刺信号方面的潜力。",
