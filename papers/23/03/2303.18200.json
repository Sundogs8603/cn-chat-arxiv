    "translated_abstract": "在社会数据科学中，数据隐私和所有权是非常重要的，并提出了法律和伦理问题。当不同方拥有数据的不同部分时，共享和分析数据变得困难。一种应对挑战的方法是在收集数据进行分析之前将数据应用去识别化或匿名化技术。然而，这样做可能会降低数据效用并增加重新识别的风险。为了解决这些局限性，我们提出了PADME，这是一个分布式分析工具，它联邦了模型实现和训练。PADME使用联邦方法，模型由所有方实现和部署，并逐步访问每个数据位置进行训练。这使得可以跨位置分析数据，同时仍允许像所有数据都在同一位置一样训练模型。在数据的原始位置上训练模型可以保留数据所有权。此外，只有在所有数据位置上的分析都完成后，才会提供结果。",
