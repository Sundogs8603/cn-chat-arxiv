    "translated_abstract": "部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDPs）提供了一种有效的方法来建模实际的序贯决策过程。本文针对独立动态基础设施组件的维护和检查问题，提出了一种算法来寻找多组件预算约束POMDP的最优策略。我们首先引入了带预算的POMDP模型（b-POMDP），在遵守预算约束的同时，允许我们找到POMDP的最优策略。接下来，我们证明了在有限期的情况下，b-POMDP的值函数或最大收益是预算的凹函数。我们的第二个贡献是一种算法，通过找到各个组件POMDP之间的最优预算分配来计算多组件预算约束POMDP的最优策略。最优预算分配被表示为一种福利最大化问题，并且利用值函数的凹性质来计算解决方案。",
