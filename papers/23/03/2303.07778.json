    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely investigated in the field of semi-supervised graph machine learning. Most methods fail to exploit adequate graph information when labeled data is limited, leading to the problem of oversmoothing. To overcome this issue, we propose the Graph Alignment Neural Network (GANN), a simple and effective graph neural architecture. A unique learning algorithm with three alignment rules is proposed to thoroughly explore hidden information for insufficient labels. Firstly, to better investigate attribute specifics, we suggest the feature alignment rule to align the inner product of both the attribute and embedding matrices. Secondly, to properly utilize the higher-order neighbor information, we propose the cluster center alignment rule, which involves aligning the inner product of the cluster center matrix with the unit matrix. Finally, to get reliable prediction results with few labels, we establish the minimum entropy alignment rule by lining up the ",
