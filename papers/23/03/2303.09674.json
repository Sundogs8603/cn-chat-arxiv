    "translated_abstract": "广义少样本目标检测旨在实现基础类别和新颖类别的精准检测。现有方法在增强少样本泛化的同时牺牲了基础类别的性能，或者在基础类别检测精度有限的情况下，在新颖类别的适应性方面有限的提高。本文指出了这个问题的原因在于所有类别的不足的判别特征学习。因此，我们提出了一种新的训练框架 DiGeo，学习几何感知特征来实现跨类别间的分离和类内紧密性。为了指导特征聚类的分离，我们推导出离线的简单光角紧框架（ETF）分类器，其权重作为类中心并最大、均等的分开。为了紧密每个类别的聚类，我们将自适应的类特定间距添加到分类损失中，并鼓励接近类中心的特征。实验结果证明了我们提出的方法的有效性，同时在公共基准上取得了最新水平。",
