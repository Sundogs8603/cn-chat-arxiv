    "abstract": "In this work, we study the implications of the implicit bias of gradient flow on generalization and adversarial robustness in ReLU networks. We focus on a setting where the data consists of clusters and the correlations between cluster means are small, and show that in two-layer ReLU networks gradient flow is biased towards solutions that generalize well, but are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. Our results hold even in cases where the network has many more parameters than training examples. Despite the potential for harmful overfitting in such overparameterized settings, we prove that the implicit bias of gradient flow prevents it. However, the implicit bias also leads to non-robust solutions (susceptible to small adversarial $\\ell_2$-perturbations), even though robust networks that fit the data exist.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们研究了梯度流的隐式偏差对ReLU网络中泛化和对抗鲁棒性的影响。我们关注的是数据由簇组成且簇之间的相关性较小的情况，并且发现在两层ReLU网络中，梯度流在偏向泛化能力强的解决方案的同时也对小规模对抗性例子高度脆弱。我们的结果即使在网络参数远远多余训练样本的情况下也成立。尽管在这种过度参数化的设置中有潜在的有害过拟合可能性，我们证明梯度流的隐式偏差可以防止这种情况发生。然而，隐式偏差也会导致非鲁棒性的解决方案（容易受到小的对抗性$\\ell_2$扰动），尽管也存在能够拟合数据的鲁棒网络。",
