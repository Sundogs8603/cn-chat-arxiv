    "translated_abstract": "电力系统动态模拟是一个计算上昂贵的任务。考虑到发电和需求模式不确定性的增加，需要不断评估数千个场景以确保电力系统的安全性。近年来，物理信息神经网络（PINNs）已被提出作为加速非线性动力系统计算的有前途的解决方案。本文研究了这些方法在电力系统动力学中的适用性，重点关注对负载扰动的动态响应。通过将 PINNs 预测与传统求解器的解决方案进行比较，我们发现 PINNs 可以比传统求解器快 10 到 1000 倍。同时，我们发现它们即使对于大时间步长也足够准确和数值稳定。为了促进更深入的理解，本文还通过在损失函数中引入基于梯度的项，提出了神经网络（NN）训练的新规范化方法。",
