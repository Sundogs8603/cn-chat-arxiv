    "translated_abstract": "本论文运用面部识别算法，从实验室设置下拍摄的591张中性面部图像中提取面部描述符。在控制年龄、性别和种族的情况下，通过交叉验证的线性回归模型来预测参与者在政治取向量表上的得分(Cronbach的α=0.94)。模型的性能超过了r = 0.20，远优于人类评分者，与工作面试预测工作成功、酒精驱动攻击性或心理治疗改善心理健康的效果相当。此外，从标准化图像衍生出的模型在3,401名来自美国、英国和加拿大的政治人物的自然图像样本中表现良好(r = 0.12)，表明面部外貌和政治取向之间的关联可推广到我们之外的人群。面部特征与政治取向相关的分析发现，保守派的下半脸部分更大，虽然政治取向不能准确地预测个体面部特征的所有变化，但是这种发现还是富有启发性的。",
    "tldr": "本研究使用面部识别技术，通过特定的面部特征发现了人们的政治取向，甚至可以从自然图像中推广。这种预测的精度比人类评分者高，相当于一些工作面试的预测效果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study uses facial recognition technology to discover people's political orientation based on specific facial features, and the accuracy of prediction is higher than that of human raters, comparable to that of some job interviews. This finding is informative even though political orientation cannot accurately predict all facial feature variations, and it can be generalized even from naturalistic images."
