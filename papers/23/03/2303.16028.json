I provide a conceptual overview of text generation, guidance on when researchers should prefer different techniques for generating synthetic text, a discussion of ethics, and a simple technique for improving the quality of synthetic text. I demonstrate the usefulness of synthetic text with three applications: generating synthetic tweets describing the fighting in Ukraine, synthetic news articles describing specified political events for training an event detection system, and a multilingual corpus of populist manifesto statements for traini",

    "translated_abstract": "有监督文本模型对政治学家来说是一种宝贵的工具，但存在若干使用障碍，包括手动标记文档的费用，检索少量相关文档以进行标注的困难，以及共享带有注释文档所涉及的版权和隐私问题。本文提出了一个部分解决这三个问题的方案，即使用大型语言模型控制生成合成文本。作者提供了文本生成的概念概述，并指导研究人员何时应该选择不同的合成文本生成技术，讨论了伦理问题，并介绍了一种改进合成文本质量的简单技术。作者展示了合成文本的三种应用：生成描述乌克兰战斗的合成推特，生成描述特定政治事件的合成新闻文章以用于训练事件检测系统，以及一个多语言的民粹主义宣言语料库用于训练",
