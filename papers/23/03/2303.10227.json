In this paper, we introduce Conversational Tree Search (CTS) as a new task that bridges the gap between FAQ-style information retrieval and task-oriented dialog, allowing domain-experts to define dialog trees which can then be converted to an efficient dialog policy that learns only to ask the questions necessary to navigate a user to their goal. We collect a dataset for the travel reimbursement domain and demonstrate a baseline as well as a novel deep Reinforcement Learning architecture for this task.

    "translated_abstract": "对话接口提供了一种灵活和方便的方式，让用户获取原本可能难以或不方便获得的信息。然而，现有的界面大体上可以分为两种类型：FAQ，用户必须提出明确的问题以检索一般的答案；或者对话，用户必须遵循预定义的路径但可能会接收到个性化的答案。本文介绍了一种新的任务——会话树搜索(CTS)，它架起了信息检索风格FAQ和面向任务对话之间的桥梁，允许领域专家定义对话树，然后将其转换为一个有效的对话策略，只学习提出导航用户达到目标所需的问题。我们收集了旅行报销领域的数据集，并展示了这项任务的基线（baseline）以及一项新颖的深度增强学习架构。结果显示，新的架构综合了FAQ和对话的优点，取得了良好的效果。",
