    "abstract": "As Machine Learning (ML) gains adoption across industries and new use cases, practitioners increasingly realize the challenges around effectively developing and iterating on ML systems: reproducibility, debugging, scalability, and documentation are elusive goals for real-world pipelines outside tech-first companies. In this paper, we review the nature of ML-oriented workloads and argue that re-purposing existing tools won't solve the current productivity issues, as ML peculiarities warrant specialized development tooling. We then introduce Metaflow, an open-source framework for ML projects explicitly designed to boost the productivity of data practitioners by abstracting away the execution of ML code from the definition of the business logic. We show how our design addresses the main challenges in ML operations (MLOps), and document through examples, interviews and use cases its practical impact on the field.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习（ML）在各行各业和新的用例中的应用日益增多，从业者越来越意识到在有效开发和迭代ML系统方面所面临的挑战：重现性、调试、可伸缩性和文档编写对于技术第一类公司以外的真实世界管道来说是难以实现的目标。本文回顾了面向ML的工作负载的性质，并认为重新利用现有工具无法解决当前生产力问题，因为ML的特殊性需要专门的开发工具。然后，我们介绍了Metaflow，一个专门为ML项目设计的开源框架，通过将ML代码的执行与业务逻辑的定义分离来提高数据从业者的生产力。我们展示了我们的设计如何解决ML操作（MLOps）中的主要挑战，并通过示例、采访和用例记录了它对该领域的实际影响。",
