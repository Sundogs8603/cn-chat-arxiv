This paper examines the security implications of deepfakes in the metaverse, specifically in the context of gaming, online meetings, and virtual offices. The paper discusses how deepfakes can be used to impersonate in gaming scenarios, how online meetings in the metaverse open the door for impersonation, and how virtual offices in the metaverse lack physical authentication, making it easier for attackers to impersonate someone.

    "translated_abstract": "元宇宙由于其创造完全沉浸式和交互式虚拟世界的潜力，引起了各行各业的广泛关注。然而，深度伪造在元宇宙中的整合带来了严重的安全影响，特别是冒充。本文研究了深度伪造在元宇宙中的安全影响，特别是在游戏、在线会议和虚拟办公场所的背景下。本文讨论了深度伪造如何用于冒充游戏场景中的角色，如何在元宇宙的在线会议中打开冒充的大门，以及在元宇宙的虚拟办公场所缺乏身份认证，使得攻击者更容易冒充他人。本文讨论了这些安全问题对机密性、完整性和可用性（CIA三元性）的影响。本文进一步探讨了与「暗黑宇宙」和数字复制等相关问题，以及与此相关的监管和隐私问题。",
