    "abstract": "Here, we introduce a new approach for generating sequences of implied volatility (IV) surfaces across multiple assets that is faithful to historical prices. We do so using a combination of functional data analysis and neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) combined with a probability integral transform penalty to reduce model misspecification. We demonstrate that learning the joint dynamics of IV surfaces and prices produces market scenarios that are consistent with historical features and lie within the sub-manifold of surfaces that are essentially free of static arbitrage. Finally, we demonstrate that delta hedging using the simulated surfaces generates profit and loss (P&L) distributions that are consistent with realised P&Ls.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种新的方法，使用函数数据分析和神经随机微分方程，结合概率积分变换惩罚来生成多个资产的隐含波动率表面序列，该方法忠实于历史价格。我们证明了学习IV表面和价格的联合动态产生的市场情景与历史特征一致，并且在没有静态套利的表面次流形内。最后，我们证明使用模拟表面进行对冲会生成与实现P＆L一致的损益分布。",
