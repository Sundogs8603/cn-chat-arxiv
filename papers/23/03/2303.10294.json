    "abstract": "Objective: To develop machine learning models that can predict the number of COVID-19 cases per day given the last 14 days of environmental and mobility data.  Approach: COVID-19 data from four counties around Toronto, Ontario, were used. Data were prepared into daily records containing the number of new COVID case counts, patient demographic data, outdoor weather variables, indoor environment factors, and human movement based on cell mobility and public health restrictions. This data was analyzed to determine the most important variables and their interactions. Predictive models were developed using CNN and LSTM deep neural network approaches. A 5-fold chronological cross-validation approach used these methods to develop predictive models using data from Mar 1 to Oct 14 2020, and test them on data covering Oct 15 to Dec 24 2020. Results: The best LSTM models forecasted tomorrow's daily COVID case counts with 90.7% accuracy, and the 7-day rolling average COVID case counts with 98.1% ac",
