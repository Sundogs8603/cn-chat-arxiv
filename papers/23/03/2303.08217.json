    "abstract": "In this paper, we deal with an axiomatic approach to default risk. We introduce the notion of a default risk measure, which generalizes the classical probability of default (PD), and allows to incorporate model risk in various forms. We discuss different properties and representations of default risk measures via monetary risk measures, families of related tail risk measures, and Choquet capacities. In a second step, we turn our focus on default risk measures, which are given as worst-case PDs and distorted PDs. The latter are frequently used in order to take into account model risk for the computation of capital requirements through risk-weighted assets (RWAs), as demanded by the Capital Requirement Regulation (CRR). In this context, we discuss the impact of different default risk measures and margins of conservatism on the amount of risk-weighted assets.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文处理了违约风险的公理化方法，引入了违约风险度量的概念，该概念推广了经典的违约概率，并允许以各种形式融入模型风险。我们通过货币风险度量、相关尾风险度量系列和 Choquet 容量来讨论不同的违约风险度量的属性和表示。接着，我们把重点转向被给定为最坏情况违约概率和扭曲违约概率的违约风险度量。后者经常用于通过风险加权资产（RWA）计算资本要求时考虑模型风险，符合资本要求条例（CRR）的要求。在这种情况下，我们讨论不同违约风险度量和保守水平对风险加权资产金额的影响。",
