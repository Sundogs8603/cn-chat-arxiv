    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个称为IPNN的新型通用模型，它将神经网络和概率论结合在一起。在传统概率论中，概率的计算是基于事件的发生，而这在当前的神经网络中几乎不使用。因此，我们提出了一种新的概率理论，它是经典概率论的扩展，并使经典概率论成为我们理论的一种特殊情况。此外，对于我们提出的神经网络框架，神经网络的输出被定义为概率事件，并基于这些事件的统计分析，推导出分类任务的推理模型。IPNN展现了新的特性：它在进行分类的同时可以执行无监督聚类。此外，IPNN能够使用非常小的神经网络进行非常大的分类，例如100个输出节点的模型可以分类10亿类别。理论优势体现在新的概率理论和神经网络框架中，并且实验结果展示了IPNN在各种应用中的潜力。",
