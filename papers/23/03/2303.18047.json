For problems (2) and (3), we propose several novel algorithms and provide the first theoretical results for both cases when $1<p<2$ and $2\\leq p\\leq \\infty$.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文重新探讨了在欧几里得空间和一般的$\\ell_p^d$空间中进行差分隐私随机凸优化（DP-SCO）的问题。具体来说，我们关注三个仍未被充分理解的设置: (1) 在欧几里得空间限制且有界的（凸）集合上进行DP-SCO; (2) 在$\\ell_p^d$空间上无限制的DP-SCO; (3) 在限制且有界的$\\ell_p^d$空间中，使用重尾数据进行DP-SCO。对于问题（1），针对凸损失函数和强凸损失函数，我们提出了方法，其输出能够实现(预期)过量种群风险，这只取决于约束集合的高斯宽度，而不是空间维度。此外，我们还展示了对于强凸函数，界限是最优的，最多相差一个对数因子。对于问题（2）和（3），我们提出了几种新算法，并针对$1<p<2$和$2≤p≤∞$的两种情况，提供了第一个理论结果。",
