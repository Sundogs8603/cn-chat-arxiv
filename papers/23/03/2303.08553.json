    "translated_abstract": "Milner提出的正则表达式进程语义的公理化和表达问题在考虑死锁0和空步长1的完整表达式类中变得困难起来。我们报告了当0存在时添加1会产生的现象，这将这个困难的关键原因带到了聚焦点。即，虽然1-free正则表达式的解释在双模折叠下是封闭的，但任意正则表达式的解释不是这种情况。1-free正则表达式的过程图解释满足循环存在和消除属性LEE，该属性在双模折叠下得以保留。LEE的这些特征被用于证明1-free正则表达式的方程证明系统是完备的，并且用于判断一个1-free正则表达式的解释是否与一个过程图双模相似是一个多项式时间可判定的问题。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the problem of bisimulation collapse not being closed in regular expression process semantics, and identifies a crucial reason for this difficulty in 1-free regular expression interpretations. It further proposes the features of the LEE property, proves the completeness of an equational proof system for 1-free regular expressions, and demonstrates that the similarity problem between interpretation and process graph bisimilarity is solvable in polynomial time."
