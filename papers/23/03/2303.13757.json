    "translated_abstract": "图机器学习 (GML) 在节点分类、链接预测、图分类等方面取得了巨大的进展。然而，现实中的图往往具有结构不平衡性，即只有少数几个中心节点具有更密集的局部结构和更高的影响力。这种不平衡可能会损害现有 GML 模型的鲁棒性，特别是在学习尾节点时。本文提出了一种选择性图增强方法 (SAug) 来解决这个问题。首先，设计了一种基于Pagerank的采样策略来识别图中的中心节点和尾节点。其次，提出了一种选择性增强策略，将中心节点的噪声邻居放弃在一侧，并在另一侧发现潜在的邻居和为尾节点生成伪邻居。它还可以减轻两种类型节点之间的结构不平衡。最后，在增强后的图上重新训练 GNN 模型。广泛的实验表明，SAug 可以显著提高现有模型的性能。",
