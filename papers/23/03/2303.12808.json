    "abstract": "In India, people identify with a particular group based on certain attributes such as religion. The same religious groups are often provoked against each other. Previous studies show the role of provocation in increasing tensions between India's two prominent religious groups: Hindus and Muslims. With the advent of the Internet, such provocation also surfaced on social media platforms such as WhatsApp.  By leveraging an existing dataset of Indian WhatsApp posts, we identified three categories of provoking sentences against Indian Muslims. Further, we labeled 7,000 sentences for three provocation categories and called this dataset PACO. We leveraged PACO to train a model that can identify provoking sentences from a WhatsApp post. Our best model is fine-tuned RoBERTa and achieved a 0.851 average AUC score over five-fold cross-validation. Automatically identifying provoking sentences could stop provoking text from reaching out to the masses, and can prevent possible discrimination or viol",

    "translated_abstract": "在印度，人们根据某些属性（如宗教）认同于特定群体，同一宗教群体经常相互挑衅。之前的研究表明，挑衅在增加印度两个主要宗教群体之间的紧张关系方面扮演着重要角色。随着互联网的出现，这种挑衅也出现在WhatsApp等社交媒体平台上。通过利用现有的印度WhatsApp帖子数据集，我们识别出了三种针对印度穆斯林的挑衅句子类别。此外，我们为三种挑衅类别标记了7000个句子，并将其称为PACO数据集。我们利用PACO来训练一个可以从WhatsApp帖子中识别挑衅句子的模型。我们的最佳模型是精调RoBERTa，并在五倍交叉验证中实现了0.851的平均AUC分数。自动识别挑衅句子可以阻止挑衅文本扩散到群众之间，可以防止可能的歧视或暴力事件。",
