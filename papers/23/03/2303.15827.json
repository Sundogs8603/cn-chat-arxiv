During the training phase, our method is fed with data collected from an operator-defined family of PDEs accompanied by the general form of this family. In the inference phase, a minimal sample collected from a phenomenon is provided, where the sample is related to the PDE family but not necessarily to the set of specific PDEs seen in the training phase. We show how our algorithm can predict the PDE solution for future timesteps. Moreover, our method provides an explainable form of the PDE, a trait that can assist in modelling phenomena based on data in physical sciences. To verify our method, we conduct extensive experimentation, examining its quality both in terms of prediction error and explainability.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种解释性的方法PDExplain用于解决偏微分方程。在训练阶段，我们的方法通过一个操作员定义的PDE家族的数据以及这个家族的一般形式进行馈送。在推断阶段，提供了一个从现象中收集到的最小样本，其中样本与 PDE 家族相关，但不一定属于训练阶段看到的具体 PDE 集合。我们展示了算法如何预测未来时间步的PDE解。此外，我们的方法提供了PDE的可解释形式，这种特征可以协助通过物理科学数据来对现象进行建模。为了验证我们的方法，我们进行了大量实验，考察了其在预测误差和可解释性方面的质量。",
