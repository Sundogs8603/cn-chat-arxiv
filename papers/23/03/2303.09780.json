    "abstract": "The challenge on forestalling monkeypox (Mpox) spread is the timely, convenient and accurate diagnosis for earlystage infected individuals. Here, we propose a remote and realtime online visualization strategy, called \"Super Monitoring\" to construct a low cost, convenient, timely and unspecialized diagnosis of early-stage Mpox. Such AI-mediated \"Super Monitoring\" (Mpox-AISM) invokes a framework assembled by deep learning, data augmentation and self-supervised learning, as well as professionally classifies four subtypes according to dataset characteristics and evolution trend of Mpox and seven other types of dermatopathya with high similarity, hence these features together with reasonable program interface and threshold setting ensure that its Recall (Sensitivity) was beyond 95.9% and the specificity was almost 100%. As a result, with the help of cloud service on Internet and communication terminal, this strategy can be potentially utilized for the real-time detection of earlystage Mpox ",
