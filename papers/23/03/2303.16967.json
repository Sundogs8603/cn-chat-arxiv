    "abstract": "This paper studies how a domain-independent planner and combinatorial search can be employed to play Angry Birds, a well established AI challenge problem. To model the game, we use PDDL+, a planning language for mixed discrete/continuous domains that supports durative processes and exogenous events. The paper describes the model and identifies key design decisions that reduce the problem complexity. In addition, we propose several domain-specific enhancements including heuristics and a search technique similar to preferred operators. Together, they alleviate the complexity of combinatorial search. We evaluate our approach by comparing its performance with dedicated domain-specific solvers on a range of Angry Birds levels. The results show that our performance is on par with these domain-specific approaches in most levels, even without using our domain-specific search enhancements.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究如何使用通用型规划器与组合搜索来玩愤怒的小鸟——一个已经成为AI挑战问题的游戏。我们使用PDDL+来建模游戏，这是一种支持持续过程和外生事件的混合离散/连续域计划语言。本文描述了模型，并确定了降低问题复杂性的关键设计决策。此外，我们提出了一些特定于域的增强措施，包括启发式和类似于首选运算符的搜索技术。它们共同缓解了组合搜索的复杂性。我们通过将其与专门的特定领域解算器在一系列愤怒的小鸟水平上的表现进行比较来评估我们的方法。结果表明，在大多数水平上，我们的表现与这些特定领域的方法相当，即使不使用我们的特定领域搜索增强措施。",
