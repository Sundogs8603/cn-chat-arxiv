    "translated_abstract": "现有的开放集动作识别方法集中于新颖性检测，假设视频剪辑显示单个动作，这在现实世界中是不现实的。我们提出了一种通过多标签证据学习（MULE）进行开放集动作识别和新颖性检测的新方法，该方法超越了以前的新动作检测方法，通过解决同一场景中单个或多个演员以及任何演员的同时动作的更一般问题。我们的Beta证据神经网络基于演员-上下文-对象关系表示，使用Beta密度估计多动作不确定性。在优化过程中，添加证据去偏置约束到目标函数中，以减少视频表示的静态偏差，从而可以错误地关联预测和静态线索。我们开发了一个基于原始-对偶平均方案更新的学习算法，以优化所提出的问题。优化算法的理论分析证明了其收敛性和复杂性。",
