    "translated_abstract": "采用数字病理学技术仍面临着高维度数字病理切片的挑战，即如何高效处理整个切片图像（WSI）。为了加速图像分析并为病理学结果的可视化和可解释性提供帮助，需利用深度学习技术引入紧凑的WSI表示方法。本文提出了一种新的基于大规模多目标优化的嵌入式WSI表示的动态演化算法。我们从基于补丁的采样开始，利用KimiaNet等组织病理学专用深度网络来提取大量特征向量。在粗糙的多目标特征选择阶段，采用分类准确性和特征数量作为指导，使用缩小搜索空间的策略。在第二阶段，通过多次粗略的演化算法优化得到相对较优的特征集，构建了频繁特征直方图（FFH）WSI表示。最终通过进一步优化得到了WIS的紧凑嵌入表示，以提高WSI图像处理的效率。",
