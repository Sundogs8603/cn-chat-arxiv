    "translated_abstract": "全景场景图生成（PSG）是一项最近提出的图像场景理解任务，旨在对图像进行分割和提取主体、对象及其关系三元组以构建场景图。由于关系类别的长尾问题，这项任务特别具有挑战性，使得单纯的有偏倚方法更倾向于高频率关系。现有的无偏倚方法通过数据/损失重新平衡以支持低频率关系来解决长尾问题。其次，一个主体-对象对可以有两个或更多在语义上重叠的关系。虽然现有的方法倾向于使用一个而不是另一个，但我们提出的HiLo框架让不同的网络分支专门处理低频和高频关系，强制实施它们的一致性并融合结果。据我们所知，我们是首次提出明确无偏PSG方法的人。在广泛的实验中，我们展示了HiLo框架取得了最先进的结果。",
