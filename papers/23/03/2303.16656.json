    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于循环神经网络（RNN）的架构来从轨迹数据中学习一个因果、时不变且连续时间控制系统的流函数。通过将控制输入的类别限制为分段常数函数，我们展示了学习流函数等价于学习离散时间动态系统的状态映射的输入输出映射关系。因此，提出一个由编码器和解码器网络构成的RNN，以将系统状态映射到RNN的隐藏状态以及将隐藏状态映射回系统状态。通过利用系统的因果性和时不变性，我们证明了提出的架构能够近似地表示流函数，且可以在任意时间查询学习到的流函数。我们通过Van der Pol和FitzHugh Nagumo振荡器的模型验证了所提出方法的有效性，结果表明该架构能够准确地重现这两个系统的轨迹。对于Van der Pol振荡器，我们展示了该架构如何用于计算将系统引导到所需轨迹的最优控制输入。",
