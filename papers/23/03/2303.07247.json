    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理和人工智能的最新进展与应用在多个领域（如法律、医疗和心理健康）取得了很大成功。最近提出了基于人工智能的语言模型（如判决预测）用于法律领域。然而，这些模型从训练数据中捕捉到了社会偏见。虽然NLP领域的偏见和公平性已经得到研究，但大多数研究主要定位在西方背景下。本文从印度的法律领域出发，对公平性进行了初步调查。我们重点研究了在印地语法律文档上训练的模型在保释预测任务中传递学习到的算法偏见。我们使用群体平等评估公平性差距，并展示了一个决策树模型在保释预测任务中，在与印度教徒和穆斯林相关的输入特征上具有0.237的整体公平性差距。此外，我们强调了对印度法律领域的公平性研究的必要性。",
