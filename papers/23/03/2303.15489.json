    "translated_abstract": "铁路运营涉及不同类型的实体（站点，列车等），现有的同质节点（即相同类型的节点）的图/网络模型无法捕捉实体之间的相互作用。本文旨在开发一种异构图神经网络（HetGNN）模型，该模型可以应用于不同类型的节点（即异构节点），以研究铁路网络上的列车延误演化。为此，提出了一种组合HetGNN模型和GraphSAGE同质GNN（HomoGNN）的图形架构，称为SAGE-Het，旨在基于不同的边捕捉列车，列车、站点以及站点之间的相互作用。与传统方法要求输入具有恒定的维度（例如在矩形或类似网格的数组中）或仅允许在图中使用同质节点相比，SAGE-Het允许灵活的输入和异构节点。收集中国北京广州线上两个站点的数据以验证HetGNN模型。实验证明，所提出的SAGE-Het模型在预测列车延误演化方面优于传统模型，例如长短时记忆（LSTM）和HomoGNN模型。",
