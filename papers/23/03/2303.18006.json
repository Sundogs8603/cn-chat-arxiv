    "abstract": "Without the ability to estimate and benchmark AI capability advancements, organizations are left to respond to each change reactively, impeding their ability to build viable mid and long-term strategies. This paper explores the recent growth of forecasting, a political science tool that uses explicit assumptions and quantitative estimation that leads to improved prediction accuracy. Done at the collective level, forecasting can identify and verify talent, enable leaders to build better models of AI advancements and improve inputs into design policy. Successful approaches to forecasting and case studies are examined, revealing a subclass of \"superforecasters\" who outperform 98% of the population and whose insights will be most reliable. Finally, techniques behind successful forecasting are outlined, including Phillip Tetlock's \"Ten Commandments.\" To adapt to a quickly changing technology landscape, designers and policymakers should consider forecasting as a first line of defense.",

    "translated_abstract": "如果无法评估和基准定量技术发展水平，组织就将被迫采取反应性方式应对每一次变化，从而阻碍其建立可行的中长期战略。本文探讨了政治科学工具——预测的最近发展情况，该工具使用明确的假设和定量的估计方法，从而提高了预测的准确性。当预测在集体层面进行时，可以确定和验证人才，使领导者能够构建更好的技术发展模型以及改进制定政策的方法。本文还研究了预测的成功案例，并揭示了一类“超级预测者”，他们的见解最为可靠，超过了98%的人群。最后，本文概述了成功预测背后的技术，包括菲利普·特特洛克的“十诫”。为了适应快速变化的技术环境，设计师和政策制定者应该将预测作为第一道防线考虑。",
