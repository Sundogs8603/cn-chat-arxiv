    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）已经改变了许多领域，包括自然语言处理、计算机视觉和强化学习。这些模型也在法律领域产生了重要的影响，它们被越来越多地用于自动化各种法律任务，例如法律判断预测、法律文件分析和法律文件撰写。然而，将LLMs整合到法律领域中也引发了一些法律问题，包括隐私问题、偏见和可解释性。在本次调查中，我们探索了将LLMs融入法律领域的情况。我们讨论了LLMs在法律任务中的各种应用，研究了它们使用时出现的法律挑战，并探讨了可以用于在法律领域专门化LLMs的数据资源。最后，我们讨论了几个有前途的方向并总结了本文。通过这样做，我们希望提供LLMs在法律上的当前状态概述，并突出其潜在的好处和挑战。",
