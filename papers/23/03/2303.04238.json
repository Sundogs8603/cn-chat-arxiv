    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks on deep-learning models have been receiving increased attention in recent years. Work in this area has mostly focused on gradient-based techniques, so-called white-box attacks, wherein the attacker has access to the targeted model's internal parameters; such an assumption is usually unrealistic in the real world. Some attacks additionally use the entire pixel space to fool a given model, which is neither practical nor physical (i.e., real-world). On the contrary, we propose herein a gradient-free method that uses the learned image manifold of a pretrained generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate naturalistic physical adversarial patches for object detectors. We show that our proposed method works both digitally and physically.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习模型的对抗攻击越来越引起关注。这一领域的研究大多集中在基于梯度的技术，即所谓的白盒攻击，在其中攻击者可以访问目标模型的内部参数。然而，这种假设在实际世界中通常是不现实的。相对地，我们提出了一种在无需使用梯度的情况下，利用预先训练的生成对抗网络（GAN）的学习图像流形来生成自然的物理对抗补丁，用于物体检测器的攻击方法。我们展示了我们提出的方法在数字和物理层面上均可行。",
