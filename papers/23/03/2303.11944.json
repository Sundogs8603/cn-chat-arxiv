    "abstract": "We describe the current state of world-class memory competitions, including the methods used to prepare for and compete in memory competitions, based on the subjective report of World Memory Championship Grandmaster and co-author Nelson Dellis. We then explore the reported experiences through the lens of the Simulated, Situated, and Structurally coherent Qualia (S3Q) theory of consciousness, in order to propose a set of experiments to help further understand the boundaries of expert memory performance.",
