However, they are difficult to apply to time series as the autocorrelative structure of time series violates basic assumptions required by conformal prediction. We propose HopCPT, a novel conformal prediction approach for time series that not only copes with temporal structures but leverages them. We show that our approach is theoretically well justified for time series where temporal dependencies are present. In experiments, we demonstrate that our new approach outperforms state-of-the-art conformal prediction methods on multiple real-world time series datasets from four different domains.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了量化不确定性，一致性预测方法受到越来越多的关注，并已成功应用于各个领域。然而，它们难以应用于时间序列，因为时间序列的自相关结构违反了一致性预测所需的基本假设。我们提出了 HopCPT，一种新的基于 Hopfield 网络的时间序列一致性预测方法，不仅能够应对时间结构，而且能够利用它们。我们证明了我们的方法在存在时间依赖性的时间序列中在理论上是有很好的理论基础的。在实验中，我们证明了我们的新方法在四个不同领域的多个真实世界时间序列数据集上优于现有的最先进的一致性预测方法。",
