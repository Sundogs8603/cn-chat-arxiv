    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于电子病历(EHRs)估计医疗干预的持续时间在临床决策支持领域引起了重视。然而，当前的模型主要关注结构化数据，忽略了来自非结构化的临床自由文本数据的信息。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新颖的语言增强Transformer-based框架，它使用经过预训练的句子编码器将所有相关的临床数据模态（连续、分类、二进制和自由文本特征）投影到一个协调的语言潜空间中，借助医学提示。所提出的方法使得不同模态的信息在单元变压器编码器中集成起来，从而实现更准确的医学干预持续时间估计。我们在美国（ICU住院时间估计）和亚洲（手术持续时间预测）医学数据集上的实验结果证明了我们提出的框架的有效性。",
