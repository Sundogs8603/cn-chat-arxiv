    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）正在几乎所有领域产生深远的影响，其成功的关键之一是可用于构建机器学习模型的丰富高质量数据。最近，数据在AI中的作用得到了显著放大，引发了数据中心AI这一新兴概念的出现。研究人员和从业者的注意力逐渐从推进模型设计转向提高数据质量和数量。在本调查中，我们讨论了数据中心AI的必要性，随后从训练数据开发、推理数据开发和数据维护三个一般性数据中心目标以及代表性方法的全面视角进行了介绍。我们还从自动化和协作的角度组织了现有文献，讨论了挑战，并列出了各种任务的测试基准。我们认为，这是第一份提供跨越各个阶段一系列任务的全球视角的综合性调查。",
