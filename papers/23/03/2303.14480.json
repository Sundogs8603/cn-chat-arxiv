    "translated_abstract": "分类法被制定为支持许多下游任务的有向无环概念图或树。许多新概念需要添加到现有分类法中。然而，传统的分类法扩展任务仅旨在找到新概念在现有分类法中的最佳位置，但在实际场景中存在两个缺点。先前的方法效率低下，因为当大多数新概念实际上是噪声概念时，它们会浪费很多时间。它们也因仅从现有分类法中收集训练样本而限制了模型挖掘真实概念之间更多的上下位关系的能力。本文提出了一个可插拔的框架，称为用于分类法添加评估的生成敌对网络（GANTEE），以减轻这些缺点。在该框架中设计了一种生成对抗网络，通过辨别模型减轻第一个缺点，并引入一种新的综合数据生成方法以缓解第二个缺点。与先前的方法相比，GANTEE框架表现出更优异的性能。",
