    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的游戏搜索算法PN-MCTS，它将蒙特卡罗树搜索（MCTS）和证明数搜索（PNS）相结合。这两种算法已成功应用于各种领域的决策问题。我们定义了三个领域，即最终走步选择，解决子树以及UCT公式，这些领域可以利用在MCTS树中收集到的证明数和证伪数提供的附加知识。我们在不同的时间设置下对所有可能的组合进行了测试，并在几个游戏中与vanilla UCT MCTS进行对决：动作线（$7$$\\times$$7$和$8$$\\times$$8$），MiniShogi， Knightthrough， Awari和Gomoku。此外，我们对该算法进行扩展，以适当地处理出现平局的游戏，如Awari，通过在MCTS树的顶部添加一个附加的PNS层。实验结果表明，PN-MCTS在6个游戏领域中有5个的胜率优于MCTS（除了Gomoku），其中在动作线游戏中获得了高达96.2%的胜率。",
