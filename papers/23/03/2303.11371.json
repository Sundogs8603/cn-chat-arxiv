We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on a dataset of EEG recordings collected during a cognitive load task and compared it to other state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in classifying mental states and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and computational efficiency.",
