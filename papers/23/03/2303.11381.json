    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了MM-REACT，一种将ChatGPT与视觉专家池集成以实现多模态推理和行动的系统范式。我们定义并探索了一系列先进的视觉任务，这些任务很有趣，但可能超出了现有视觉和视觉语言模型的能力范围。为了实现这种高级视觉智能，MM-REACT引入了一种文本提示设计，可以表示文本描述、文本化的空间坐标和对齐的文件名，用于处理图像和视频等密集的视觉信号。MM-REACT的提示设计允许语言模型接受、关联和处理多模态信息，从而促进了ChatGPT和各种视觉专家的协同组合。零样本实验证明了MM-REACT解决感兴趣的特定能力以及在需要高级视觉理解的不同场景中具有广泛应用的有效性。此外，我们还讨论和比较了M",
