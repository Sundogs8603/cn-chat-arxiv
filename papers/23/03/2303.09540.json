    "abstract": "Progress in machine learning has been driven in large part by massive increases in data. However, large web-scale datasets such as LAION are largely uncurated beyond searches for exact duplicates, potentially leaving much redundancy. Here, we introduce SemDeDup, a method which leverages embeddings from pre-trained models to identify and remove semantic duplicates: data pairs which are semantically similar, but not exactly identical. Removing semantic duplicates preserves performance and speeds up learning. Analyzing a subset of LAION, we show that SemDeDup can remove 50% of the data with minimal performance loss, effectively halving training time. Moreover, performance increases out of distribution.

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习领域的进展很大程度上是由海量数据的增加推动的。然而，像LAION这样的大型网络规模数据集在除查找精确重复项外，大部分未经精心筛选，可能存在很多冗余。在这里，我们介绍SemDeDup，一种基于预训练模型的嵌入来识别和删除语义重复项的方法：即语义上相似但并非完全相同的数据对。去除语义重复项可以保持性能并加速学习。通过对LAION的子集进行分析，我们展示了SemDeDup可以最小化性能损失的同时删除50%的数据，实际上将训练时间减半。此外，性能在分布以外得到提高。同时，通过分析在部分筛选过的数据集C4上训练的语言模型，我们展示了SemDeDup在提供效率收益的同时改进了先前的方法。SemDeDup提供了一个利用质量嵌入简单方法来使模型更快地学习的示例。",
