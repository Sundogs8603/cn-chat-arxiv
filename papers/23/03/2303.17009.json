    "translated_abstract": "图像到图像翻译（I2I）方法允许生成具有不同风格但与原始图像共享内容的人工图像。近年来，随着基于生成对抗网络（GANs）的方法的进展，I2I方法实现了生成与自然图像无法区分的人工图像。最近，针对组织病理学中不同类型的染色，I2I方法也被用于生成模拟的染色组织的人工图像。我们将这个过程称为染色转移。由于I2I变种的数量不断增加，这使得选择最合适的I2I方法进行染色转移变得困难。在我们的工作中，我们比较了12种染色转移方法，其中3种基于传统方法，9种基于GAN图像处理方法。分析依赖于定量评估图像翻译质量的补充措施，以及对深度学习组织成像和医学诊断的适用性的评估，以及经验丰富的病理学家的定性评估。我们的实验表明，有几种I2I方法优于染色转移领域的现有技术，并可用于大规模染色组织病理学图像的合成。",
