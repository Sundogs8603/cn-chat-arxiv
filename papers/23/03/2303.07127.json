    "abstract": "We show that the error achievable using physics-informed neural networks for solving systems of differential equations can be substantially reduced when these networks are trained using meta-learned optimization methods rather than to using fixed, hand-crafted optimizers as traditionally done. We choose a learnable optimization method based on a shallow multi-layer perceptron that is meta-trained for specific classes of differential equations. We illustrate meta-trained optimizers for several equations of practical relevance in mathematical physics, including the linear advection equation, Poisson's equation, the Korteweg--de Vries equation and Burgers' equation. We also illustrate that meta-learned optimizers exhibit transfer learning abilities, in that a meta-trained optimizer on one differential equation can also be successfully deployed on another differential equation.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们表明，利用元学习优化方法训练物理知识注入神经网络能够显著减少这些网络用于求解微分方程系统时的误差，而不是传统地使用固定的手工制作优化器。我们选择一种可学习的优化方法（基于一个浅的多层感知器），这种方法是针对特定类型的微分方程进行元训练的。我们展示了几个在数学物理学中具有实际意义的方程的元训练优化器，包括线性平流方程、泊松方程、Korteweg-de Vries方程和Burgers方程。我们还展示了元学习优化器具有迁移学习能力，即用于一个微分方程的元训练优化器也可以成功地在另一个微分方程上使用。",
