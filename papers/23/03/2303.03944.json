    "translated_abstract": "双层优化是一种常用的两级层次优化方法，已广泛应用于许多机器学习任务，如超参数学习、元学习和持续学习。然而，在下层问题为非凸时，双层方法的研究还不够充分。为此，本文研究了一类非凸双层优化问题，其中上层问题和下层问题均为非凸问题，并且下层问题满足Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL)条件。我们提出了一种高效的基于动量的梯度双层方法(MGBiO)来解决这些确定性问题。同时，我们提出了一类高效的基于动量的随机梯度双层方法(MSGBiO和VR-MSGBiO)来解决这些随机问题。此外，我们为我们的方法提供了一个有用的收敛分析框架。具体而言，在一些温和的条件下，我们证明了MGBiO方法具有收敛性。",
