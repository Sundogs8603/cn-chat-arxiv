A circular kernel is first presented according to the von Mises distribution. Based thereon, the so-called hypertoroidal von Mises (HvM) kernel is proposed to establish GPs on hypertori with consideration of correlational circular components. The proposed HvM kernel is demonstrated with multi-output GP regression for learning vector-valued functions defined on hypertori using the intrinsic coregionalization model. Analytical derivatives in hyperparameter optimization are provided for runtime-critical applications. For evaluation, we synthesize a ranging-based sensor network and employ the HvM-based GPs for data-driven recursive localization.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种在方向流形积上建立高斯过程（GPs）的方法，并引入了基于 von Mises 分布的循环核。在此基础上，我们提出了所谓的超环维 von Mises（HvM）核，以考虑循环关联组件来建立超环面上的高斯过程。通过使用内在的核相关模型，运用多输出 GP 回归进行学习，用于定义在超环面上的向量值函数。为运行时关键应用程序提供了超参数优化的分析导数。为了评估所提出的方法，我们合成了基于距离的传感器网络，并采用 HvM-based GP 进行数据驱动递归定位。数值结果表明，与参数模型和基于传统核设计的高斯过程相比，HvM-based GP 实现了更优的跟踪精度。",
