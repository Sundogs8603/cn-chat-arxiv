    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨如何利用图神经网络（GNN）更有效地调度纳米卫星任务。在离线纳米卫星任务调度（ONTS）问题中，目标是找到在轨道上执行任务的最佳安排，同时考虑服务质量（QoS）方面的考虑因素，如优先级，最小和最大激活事件，执行时间框架，周期和执行窗口，以及卫星电力资源和能量收集和管理的复杂性的约束。ONTS问题已经使用传统的数学公式和精确方法进行了处理，但是它们在问题的挑战性案例中的适用性有限。本研究考察了在这种情况下使用GNN的方法，该方法已经成功应用于许多优化问题，包括旅行商问题，调度问题和设施放置问题。在本文中，我们将ONTS问题的MILP实例完全表示成二分图网络结构来应用GNN。",
