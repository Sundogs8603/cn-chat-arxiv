    "translated_abstract": "随着移动网络的快速发展，人们的社交联系得到了极大的便利。然而，移动社交网络欺诈的兴起给人们带来了巨大困扰，可能造成个人和社会财富的损失，并潜在地对经济造成重大损害。为了检测欺诈用户，广泛使用反映用户移动网络中社交行为的通话详单记录（CDR）数据。但是，上述数据中的不平衡问题可能严重阻碍基于图神经网络（GNN）的欺诈检测器的有效性，在先前的工作中几乎没有得到解决。本文将创造性地结合代价敏感学习和图神经网络，提出了一种新颖的代价敏感图神经网络（CSGNN）。我们在两个开源实际移动网络欺诈数据集上进行了广泛的实验。结果表明，CSGNN可以有效解决移动社交网络欺诈检测中的图像平衡问题，并在几个最先进的基线模型上实现了显着的改进。",
