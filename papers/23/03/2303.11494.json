    "translated_abstract": "大多数被广泛使用的配体对接方法都假设蛋白结构是刚性的，当靶蛋白在配体结合时发生形变时，就会出现问题。特别是由于配体和蛋白质原子之间的明显冲突导致计算出的范德华能量项极高，因此配体的真实结合位姿通常会被评分得非常不利。传统上，这个问题是通过显式搜索受体构象以考虑受体在配体结合中的柔性来解决的。在这里，我们提出了一个深度学习模型，训练它在预测范德华能量时隐式考虑受体的柔性。我们展示了将这个机器学习能量项合并到最先进的基于物理的评分函数中可以提高小分子配体位姿预测结果的性能，特别是在存在大量蛋白形变的情况下，而不会恶化在存在最小蛋白形变的情况下的性能。",
