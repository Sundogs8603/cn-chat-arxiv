    "abstract": "The creation of new technological concepts through design reuses, recombination, and synthesis of prior concepts to create new ones may lead to exponential growth of the concept space over time. However, our statistical analysis of a large-scale technology semantic network consisting of over four million concepts from patent texts found evidence of a persistent deceleration in the pace of concept creation and a decline in the originality of newly created concepts. These trends may be attributed to the limitations of human intelligence in innovating beyond an expanding space of prior art. To sustain innovation, we recommend the development and implementation of creative artificial intelligence that can augment various aspects of the innovation process, including learning, creation, and evaluation.",

    "translated_abstract": "通过对之前的概念重用、重组和合成进行新技术概念的创造可能会导致概念空间的指数增长。然而，我们对由专利文本中超过400万个概念组成的大规模技术语义网络进行的统计分析发现，概念创造的步伐在持续减缓，并且新创造出的概念的原创性有所下降。这些趋势可以归因于人类智力在创新超出现有技术的拓展空间方面的局限。为了保持创新，我们建议开发和实施创造性人工智能，以增强创新过程的多个方面，包括学习、创造和评估。",
