    "translated_abstract": "生成模型在经典和量子机器学习中越来越受到关注，并且代表了在近期实现量子优势的有前途的候选项。在本研究中，我们建立在一个评估生成模型泛化性能的框架上，并建立了首个量化的量子与经典生成模型的实用竞速比较（PQA），包括量子电路出生机器（QCBMs）、变压器（TFs）、递归神经网络（RNNs）、变分自编码器（VAEs）和Wasserstein生成对抗网络（WGANs）。在定义了四种不同类型的PQA场景之后，我们专注于比较量子模型与最优经典算法在这个任务中的表现。我们让这些模型在一个明确定义和与应用相关的比赛环境中进行竞速，其中我们使用了20个变量（量子比特）来展示和证明我们的框架。",
