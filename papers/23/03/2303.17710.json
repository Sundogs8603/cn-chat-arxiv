    "abstract": "The proliferation of automated conversational systems such as chatbots, spoken-dialogue systems, and smart speakers, has significantly impacted modern digital life. However, these systems are primarily designed to provide answers to well-defined questions rather than to support users in exploring complex, ill-defined questions. In this paper, we aim to push the boundaries of conversational systems by examining the types of nebulous, open-ended questions that can best be answered through conversation. We first sampled 500 questions from one million open-ended requests posted on AskReddit, and then recruited online crowd workers to answer eight inquiries about these questions. We also performed open coding to categorize the questions into 27 different domains. We found that the issues people believe require conversation to resolve satisfactorily are highly social and personal. Our work provides insights into how future research could be geared to align with users' needs.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动会话系统（如聊天机器人、语音对话系统和智能音箱）的广泛应用已经深刻地影响了现代数字生活。然而，这些系统主要设计用于回答明确定义的问题，而非支持用户探索复杂的、不明确的问题。本文旨在通过研究哪些模糊的、开放性问题最适合通过对话来回答，推动会话系统的边界。我们首先从 AskReddit 上发布的100万个开放式请求中随机抽取了500个问题，然后招募在线工人回答这些问题的8个询问。我们还执行开放式编码，将问题分类为27个不同的领域。我们发现，人们认为需要交谈才能满意解决的问题是高度社交和个人化的。本文提供了未来研究如何适应用户需求的见解。",
