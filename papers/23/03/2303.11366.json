    "translated_abstract": "最近决策大型语言模型（LLM）代理的发展在各种基准测试中展现出卓越的性能。然而，这些最先进的方法通常需要内部模型微调、外部模型微调或在定义的状态空间上进行策略优化。由于高质量训练数据的稀缺性或缺乏良好定义的状态空间，实现这些方法可能会具有挑战性。此外，这些代理没有人类决策过程固有的某些品质，特别是从错误中学习的能力。通过反思，人类可以通过试错过程高效地解决新的问题。在最近的研究基础上，我们提出 Reflexion，一种将动态记忆和自我反思能力赋予智能体的方法，以增强其现有的推理轨迹和任务特定的行动选择能力。为了实现完全自动化，我们介绍了一种简单而有效的方法。",
