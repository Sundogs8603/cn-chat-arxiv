Recently, the ConvNeXt architecture attempted to modernize the standard ConvNet by mirroring Transformer blocks. In this work, we improve upon this to design a modernized and scalable convolutional architecture customized to challenges of data-scarce medical settings. We introduce MedNeXt, a Transformer-inspired large kernel segmentation network which introduces - 1) A fully ConvNeXt 3D Encoder-Decoder Network for medical image segmentation, 2) Residual ConvNeXt up and downsampling blocks to preserve semantic richness across scales, 3) A novel technique to iteratively increase kernel sizes by upsampling small kernel ",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，在医学图像分割中使用基于 Transformer 的架构越来越多，但是由于缺乏大规模标注的医学数据集，使得其性能远不如自然图像。相比之下，卷积神经网络具有更高的归纳偏差，因此更容易训练到高性能水平。最近，ConvNeXt 架构尝试通过镜像变压器块来现代化标准卷积神经网络。在这项工作中，我们改进了这一架构，设计了一种现代化且可扩展的卷积神经网络，以应对数据稀缺的医学环境的挑战。我们引入 MedNeXt，这是一个受变压器启发的大核分割网络，其中包括：1）用于医学图像分割的完全 ConvNeXt 3D 编码器 - 解码器网络，2）残差 ConvNeXt 上下采样块，以在各个尺度上保留语义信息，3）一种新的技术，通过上采样小核来迭代增加核大小。",
