    "translated_abstract": "AI协作者的愿景长期以来一直是科幻小说的经典素材，其中人工智能代理理解协作和人类沟通的微妙差别。它们通过贡献特殊的才能给他们的人类合作者和团队带来优势。多年来，政府咨询团体和人工智能领域的领袖一直倡导AIs应该具有人类兼容性和有效协作的能力。然而，具备像才华横溢的人那样协作能力的强大的AI仍然遥不可及。这篇论文依据对人工智能和人类代理有效和强大协作所需认知的分析，概述了公众和AI愿景中关于人工协作者的历史，开始于早期智能增强(IA)和人工智能(AI)的愿景。这篇论文旨在成为协同AI的第二个立场文件(Stefik & Price, 2023)的动机和背景。第二篇论文回顾了多学科的现状，并提出了一个AI协作研究的路线图。",
    "tldr": "论文探讨了AI协同合作的历史和要求，是协同AI研究的动机和背景。"
