    "translated_abstract": "交通模拟在评估和改进自动驾驶规划系统中起着至关重要的作用。在公共道路上部署自动驾驶汽车后，需要与具有不同社交偏好（例如，自私或彬彬有礼的人类驾驶员）的人类道路参与者进行交互。为了确保自动驾驶汽车在不同的交互交通场景中采取安全有效的机动方式，我们应该能够在模拟环境中评估自动驾驶汽车与带有不同社交特征的反应代理之间的差异。为此，我们提出了一种社交可控行为生成（SCBG）模型，它允许用户指定生成轨迹的礼貌程度，并通过从真实驾驶数据中学习来确保逼真和类人的轨迹生成。具体而言，我们定义了一种新颖的可微度量，用于量化驾驶行为的礼貌程度，并利用边际和条件行为预测模型。",
