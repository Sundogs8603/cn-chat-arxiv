In gradient space, we monitor the gradient direction differences of each client with respect to others. And in data space, we measure the prediction error on client data using an auxiliary model.

    "translated_abstract": "如何确保联邦学习中的公平性是一个重要的话题。最近的研究探讨了如何根据客户的贡献（协作公平性）来奖励客户，以及如何实现客户之间的性能均衡（性能公平性）。尽管已经在其中一个方面取得了进展，但我们认为将二者考虑在一起是至关重要的，以吸引和激励更多不同类型的客户加入联邦学习，以获得高质量的全局模型。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种同时优化两种公平性的新方法。具体而言，我们提出了一个梯度和数据空间中的客户贡献评估方法。在梯度空间中，我们监测每个客户相对于其他客户的梯度方向差异。在数据空间中，我们使用辅助模型来测量客户数据的预测误差。基于这种贡献评估，我们提出了一种联邦学习方法，即通过贡献评估进行的联邦训练（FedCE），即使用估计的方式作为全局模型聚合。",
