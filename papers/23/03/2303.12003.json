    "abstract": "A widespread view is that Artificial Intelligence cannot be creative. We tested this assumption by comparing human-generated ideas with those generated by six Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots: alpa.ai, Copy.ai, ChatGPT (versions 3 and 4), Studio.ai, and YouChat. Humans and a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated. Interestingly, 9.4 percent of humans were more creative than the most creative GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the creative process. Continued research and development of GAI in creative tasks is crucial to fully understand this technology's potential benefits and drawbacks in shaping the future of creativity. Finally, we discuss the question of whether GAIs are capable of being truly creative.",

    "translated_abstract": "人们普遍认为人工智能不具备创造力。我们通过比较人类生成的创意与六个生成式人工智能聊天机器人（Alpa.ai，Copy.ai，ChatGPT（版本3和4），Studio.ai和YouChat）生成的创意来测试这一假设。人类和一种经过特别训练的人工智能独立评估了创意的质量和数量。我们发现，人工智能生成的创意在质量上与人类生成的创意没有定性差异，尽管它们在创意生成方式上存在差异。有趣的是，9.4％的人类比最有创造力的GAI（GPT-4）更有创造力。我们的研究表明，生成式人工智能在创造性过程中是有价值的助手。继续研究和开发生成式人工智能在创意任务中的能力对于充分了解该技术在塑造创意未来的潜在益处和缺陷至关重要。最后，我们讨论了生成式人工智能是否能够真正具有创造力的问题。",
