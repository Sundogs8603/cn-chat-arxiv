    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在不确定环境中的随机非线性系统的运动规划问题。具体来说，该问题中机器人具有随机非线性动力学和不确定的初始位置，环境中包含多个动态不确定障碍物。障碍物可以具有任意形状，可以变形和移动。所有不确定性不一定服从高斯分布。这个通用设置已在文献[1]中被考虑并解决。除了上述假设之外，本文还考虑了长期任务，在这种情况下，文献[1]中的规划方法将会失败，因为系统状态的不确定性在长时间范围内变得过大。与[1]不同，我们提出了一个实时在线运动规划算法。我们离线构建离散时间运动基元及其对应的连续时间管状体，以确保每个运动基元的几乎所有系统状态都保持在对应的管状体内。我们将概率安全约束转换为一种方法来积累管状体的概率界的在线优化问题。",
