    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）的最近进展推动了诸如OpenAI的ChatGPT之类的高性能模型的发展。这些模型在问答、论文写作和代码生成等各种任务中表现出色。然而，它们在医疗保健领域的有效性仍不确定。本研究旨在通过检查ChatGPT从非结构化健康文本中提取结构化信息的能力，重点关注生物命名实体识别和关系提取，探讨ChatGPT在临床文本挖掘中的潜力。然而，我们的初步结果表明，直接应用ChatGPT进行这些任务导致表现不佳，并引发与将患者信息上传到ChatGPT API有关的隐私问题。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一种新的训练范式，利用ChatGPT生成大量高质量的带标签的合成数据进行训练。",
