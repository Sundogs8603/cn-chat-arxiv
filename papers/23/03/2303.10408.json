ExplainFix adopts two design principles: the \"fixed filters\" principle that all spatial filter weights of convolutional neural networks can be fixed at initialization and never learned, and the \"nimbleness\" principle that only few network parameters suffice.

ExplainFix gives key insights that spatially fixed networks should have a steered initialization, that spatial convolution layers tend to prioritize low frequencies, and that most network parameters are not necessary in spatially fixed models. ExplainFix models have up to 100x fewer spatial filter kernels than fully learned models and matching or improved accuracy.

    "en_tdlr": "ExplainFix proposes fixed filters and a nimble design to improve the interpretability and training speed of deep neural networks. By using a fixed filter initialization and a sparse parameter structure, ExplainFix achieves significant reduction in model size and training time while maintaining or improving accuracy."
