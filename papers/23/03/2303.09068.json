    "translated_abstract": "对于从工业物联网设备生成的表格数据，传统基于决策树算法的机器学习（ML）技术已被采用。 但是，这些方法在处理真实数字属性占主导地位的表格数据时存在限制。 为了解决这个问题，提出了DeepInsight，REFINED和IGTD将表格数据转换为图像以利用卷积神经网络（CNN）。 他们在图像的某些特定位置收集相似的特征，使转换后的图像看起来像是实际图像。 收集类似的特征与传统的针对表格数据的ML技术形成对比，后者删除一些高度相关的属性以避免过度拟合。 此外，先前的转换方法固定了图像大小，根据表格数据的属性数量，会造成浪费或不足的像素。 因此，本文提出了一种新的转换方法Vortex特征定位（VFP）。 VFP考虑特征的相关性并放置类似的特征。",
