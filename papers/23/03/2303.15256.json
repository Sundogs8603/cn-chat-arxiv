    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习（SSL）已成为学习无标记数据的可转移表示的首选解决方案。然而，SSL需要构建已知语义相似的样本，即正视图。这种需求是SSL的主要限制，通常通过临时策略来处理，例如对相同输入应用已知的数据增强。在这项工作中，我们通过积极主动学习（PAL）将这个原则形式化和推广，其中一个oracle查询样本之间的语义关系。PAL实现了三个主要目标。首先，它揭示了一个基于相似性图的理论上有基础的学习框架，超越了SSL，可根据所使用的oracle扩展到处理监督和半监督学习。其次，它为嵌入先验知识（如观测的标签）提供了一致的算法，而无需更改训练流程中的任何内容。第三，它提供了一个适当的主动学习框架。",
