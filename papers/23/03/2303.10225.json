    "translated_abstract": "对抗性鲁棒性是衡量神经网络在推理阶段抵御对抗性攻击能力的关键概念。最近的研究表明，尽管使用的强化鲁棒性训练技术能够提高对一种类型的攻击的鲁棒性，但模型仍然容易受到多样化的$\\ell_p$攻击。为了实现多样化的$\\ell_p$鲁棒性，我们提出了一种新颖的鲁棒模态连接 (RMC) 导向的对抗性防御，它包含两个基于种群学习的学习阶段。第一个阶段，RMC，能够搜索两个预先训练模型之间的模型参数空间，并找到包含高鲁棒性点的路径以抵御多样化的$\\ell_p$攻击。基于RMC的有效性，我们开发了第二个阶段，基于RMC的优化，其中RMC作为神经网络多样化$\\ell_p$鲁棒性进一步增强的基本单元。为了提高计算效率，我们将学习与仅选择子集的对抗性示例相结合，这导致了一组较小的代表性对抗性示例，可用于增强神经网络对多样化$\\ell_p$攻击的鲁棒性。",
