In this paper, we show that when a large number of related integrals need to be computed, it is possible to leverage the similarity between these integration tasks to improve performance even when the number of samples per task is very small. Our approach, called meta learning CVs (Meta-CVs), can be used for up to hundreds or thousands of tasks. Our empirical assessment indicates that Meta-CVs can lead to significant variance reduction in such settings, and our theoretical analysis establishes general conditions under which Meta-CVs can be successfully trained.",

    "translated_abstract": "控制变量是减小蒙特卡罗估计器方差的有力工具，但在样本数量较小的情况下构建有效的控制变量可能具有挑战性。本文表明，当需要计算大量相关积分时，即使每个任务的样本数很少，也可以利用这些积分任务之间的相似性来提高性能。我们所提出的元学习CV（Meta-CVs）方法可用于处理数百个或数千个任务，并通过实证评估表明，在这种情况下，Meta-CVs可以显著减小方差。我们的理论分析确定了Meta-CVs成功训练的一般条件。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a meta-learning control variates approach, called Meta-CVs, which can reduce the variance of Monte Carlo estimators with limited data and handle multiple tasks through leveraging the similarity between integration tasks. The empirical and theoretical analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of Meta-CVs."
