    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了生成逼真的3D物体的任务，这对于自动场景生成和物理仿真等多种应用非常有用。相比于体素和点云等其他3D表示，网格在实践中更加优越，因为(1)它们可以轻松任意地操纵形状以供重新照明和仿真，(2)可以充分发挥现代图形流水线的能力，而这些流水线大多数针对网格进行了优化。以往可扩展的3D网格生成方法通常依赖于次优的后处理，并且它们往往会产生过于平滑或嘈杂的表面，缺乏精细的几何细节。为了克服这些缺点，我们利用网格的图形结构，使用简单但非常有效的生成式建模方法生成3D网格。具体来说，我们使用可变形四面体网格来表示网格，然后在这个直接参数化的网格上训练扩散模型。",
