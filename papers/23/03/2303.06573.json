As conversational search sessions are much more diverse and long-tailed, existing methods trained on limited data still show unsatisfactory effectiveness and robustness to handle real conversational search scenarios. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated amazing capabilities for text generation and conversation understanding. In this work, we present a simple yet effective prompting framework, called LLM4CS, to leverage LLMs as a text-based search intent interpreter to help conversational search. Under this framework, we explore three prompting methods to generate multiple query rewrites and hypothetical responses, and propose to aggregate them into an integrated representation that can robustly represent the user's real contextual search intent.

    "translated_abstract": "准确理解用户的上下文搜索意图对于会话搜索而言是一个重要的挑战。由于对话搜索会话的多样性和长尾性，现有的基于有限数据训练的方法在处理真实的会话搜索场景时仍然显示出不令人满意的效果和鲁棒性。最近，大型语言模型（LLM）展示了令人惊叹的文本生成和对话理解能力。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个简单但有效的提示框架，名为LLM4CS，利用LLM作为基于文本的搜索意图解释器来帮助会话搜索。在该框架下，我们探索了三种提示方法来生成多个查询重写和假设性回复，并提议将它们聚合到一个集成表示中，这可以稳健地表示用户的真实上下文搜索意图。在三个广泛使用的会话搜索基准测试上进行了广泛的自动评估和人工评估。",
