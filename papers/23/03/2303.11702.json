    "translated_abstract": "本研究在生成对抗网络（GANs）的背景下，探究了半监督学习（SSL）和开放集识别（OSR）之间的关系。尽管以前没有正式将SSL和OSR联系起来的研究，但它们各自的方法有惊人的相似之处。具体而言，SSL-GAN和OSR-GAN要求生成器在互补空间中产生样本。随后，通过对生成样本进行正则化，SSL和OSR分类器都可以完全识别开放空间。为了证明SSL和OSR之间的关联，我们在理论上和实验上比较了最先进的SSL-GAN方法和最先进的OSR-GAN方法。结果表明，文献基础更加牢固的SSL优化边缘-GAN在结合SSL-OSR任务方面树立新的标准，并在某些一般的OSR实验中取得了新的最先进的结果。然而，OSR优化的对抗性互惠点（ARP）-GAN在一些OSR任务中仍然略优于SSL-GAN。",
