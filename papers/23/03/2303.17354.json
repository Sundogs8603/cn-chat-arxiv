    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习领域，对于图像数据中的异常检测和定位的研究，尤其是在工业缺陷检测等实际应用中引起了重视。虽然现有的方法主要依赖于卷积神经网络（CNN）作为骨干网络，但我们提出了一种基于Transformer骨干网络的创新方法。我们的方法采用了两阶段的渐进式学习策略。在第一阶段，我们仅使用正常图像对Masked Autoencoder （MAE）模型进行训练，在第二阶段，我们实现了像素级数据增强技术以生成已损坏的正常图像及其相应的像素标签。这个过程使得模型可以学习如何修复损坏的区域和分类每个像素的状态。最终，该模型产生一个像素重建误差矩阵和一个像素异常概率矩阵，这两个矩阵综合成一个异常得分矩阵，有效地用于图像异常检测。",
