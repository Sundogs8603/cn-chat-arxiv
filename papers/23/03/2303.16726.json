    "abstract": "Writing a scientific article is a challenging task as it is a highly codified genre. Good writing skills are essential to properly convey ideas and results of research work. Since the majority of scientific articles are currently written in English, this exercise is all the more difficult for non-native English speakers as they additionally have to face language issues. This article aims to provide an overview of text revision in writing assistance in the scientific domain.  We will examine the specificities of scientific writing, including the format and conventions commonly used in research articles.  Additionally, this overview will explore the various types of writing assistance tools available for text revision. Despite the evolution of the technology behind these tools through the years, from rule-based approaches to deep neural-based ones, challenges still exist (tools' accessibility, limited consideration of the context, inexplicit use of discursive information, etc.)",

    "translated_abstract": "科学论文撰写是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为它是一种高度规范化的文体。良好的写作技巧对于恰当地传达研究工作的思想和结果至关重要。由于大多数科学文章目前是用英语写的，因此非英语母语的人面临的语言问题更加困难。本文旨在提供科学领域写作辅助中文本修订的概述。我们将审查科学写作的特点，包括在研究文章中常用的格式和约定。此外，这篇概述将探讨文本修订的各种类型的写作辅助工具。尽管这些工具背后的技术经过了多年的发展，从基于规则的方法到基于深度神经的方法，但仍存在挑战（工具可访问性，对上下文的有限考虑，对话信息的含义不清等）。",
