    "translated_abstract": "近年来，遗传和高维生物银行和“组学”数据的爆炸式增长为研究人员提供了研究数百到数千个相关表型的共同遗传起源（多效性）的机会。然而，现有的多表型全基因组关联研究（GWAS）方法并未建模多效性，只适用于少量表型，或无法进行推断。此外，很少观测到原始遗传和表型数据，这意味着必须在高维度的GWAS摘要统计信息上进行分析，而这些摘要统计信息在高维度下的统计特性还不够理解。因此，我们开发了一种新的模型、理论框架和一套方法，用于使用摘要统计学数据进行高维表型GWAS的贝叶斯推断，明确地建模多效性，促进快速计算，并有助于使用生物信息先验。我们通过将其应用于代谢物GWAS，证明了我们的程序的实用性。",
