    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了在文本到3D生成中出现的视角一致性问题，也称为Janus问题。这个问题来自于2D扩散模型的固有偏置，导致生成的3D对象不真实。通过对其进行研究，我们提出了两种方法来去除偏置以实现文本到3D生成的鲁棒性。第一种方法叫做score debiasing，通过逐渐增加2D扩散模型得出的分数的截断值，来达到去除偏置的效果。第二种方法叫做prompt debiasing，利用语言模型确定用户提示和视角提示之间的矛盾词语，并调整视角提示和物体空间摄像机姿态之间的差异。我们的实验结果表明，我们的方法通过显著减少伪影，提高了真实感，并在质量与速度方面取得了良好的平衡。",
