    "translated_abstract": "近年来，大量的谱图神经网络（GNN）方法利用可学习系数的多项式基在许多节点级任务上实现了顶级性能。虽然已经探索了各种多项式基，但是每种方法都采用了固定的多项式基，可能不是给定图形的最佳选择。此外，我们确定了这些方法所谓的越界问题，并表明这在它们不太系统化的正则化策略和非归一化基础上有所根源。在本文中，我们首次尝试解决这两个问题。利用雅各比多项式，我们设计了一种新的具有可学习正交标准基的谱GNN，LON-GNN，并证明了正则化系数现在等效于正则化所学滤波函数的范数。我们在多样的图数据集上进行了广泛的实验，以评估LON-GNN的拟合和泛化能力，结果表明其优于几种最先进的方法。",
