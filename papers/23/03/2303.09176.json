    "translated_abstract": "相较于企业折现现金流模型，在可行性研究中，实物期权方法现在被认为是一种有效的替代品。本文提供了一种实用的方法，利用二项树和实物期权技术评估投资项目。建议使用一个计算流程，该流程包括两个实物期权的活动阶段，这两个阶段分别对应于附加投资。该技术可用于大多数实物期权，这在企业战略方面是实际必需的。作为实物期权建模的下一步，本文开发了名为二项式-随机现金流实物期权模型的特殊案例，其中包含随机结果。提出了投资项目价值风险，并将其作为投资项目可行性的判断标准，假设存在随机结果。特别地，高斯概率分布用于建模期权结果的不确定性。选择高斯分布是因为希望获得对偏斜和尖峰的更好的模拟。",

The choice of the Gaussian distribution is caused by the desire to obtain better modeling for skewness and kurtosis."
