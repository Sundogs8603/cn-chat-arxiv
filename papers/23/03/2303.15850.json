    "abstract": "Segmentation uncertainty models predict a distribution over plausible segmentations for a given input, which they learn from the annotator variation in the training set. However, in practice these annotations can differ systematically in the way they are generated, for example through the use of different labeling tools. This results in datasets that contain both data variability and differing label styles. In this paper, we demonstrate that applying state-of-the-art segmentation uncertainty models on such datasets can lead to model bias caused by the different label styles. We present an updated modelling objective conditioning on labeling style for aleatoric uncertainty estimation, and modify two state-of-the-art-architectures for segmentation uncertainty accordingly. We show with extensive experiments that this method reduces label style bias, while improving segmentation performance, increasing the applicability of segmentation uncertainty models in the wild.

    "translated_abstract": "分割不确定性模型可以预测给定输入的可能分割结果，这些模型可以从训练集中的注释者变异性中学习而来。然而，在实践中，这些注释可能会通过使用不同的标注工具而有系统差异。这导致数据集既包含数据变异性，又包含不同的标签风格。本文证明，在这样的数据集上应用最先进的分割不确定性模型会导致模型偏差，因为不同的标签风格所造成。我们提出一种更新的建模目标，用于基于标签风格的偶然不确定性估计，修改了两个用于分割不确定性的最先进的架构。我们通过广泛的实验证明，该方法减少了标签风格偏差，同时提高了分割性能，增加了分割不确定性模型在实际应用场景中的适用性。我们精选了两个数据集用于验证我们的方法，这些数据集既包含数据变异性，又包含不同的标签风格。",
