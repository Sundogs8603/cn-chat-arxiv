    "translated_abstract": "数据隐私已成为实际大数据应用中机器学习越来越重要的考虑因素。为解决这一问题，联邦学习成为了可行的解决方案，可以利用分散且隐私的数据构建有效的机器学习模型。现有的联邦学习算法主要解决监督学习问题，这要求数据必须是全标签的。但实际上，完全标记数据往往难以获得，因为参与者可能缺乏足够的领域专业知识，或者缺乏标记数据的动机和工具。因此，在现实世界的联邦学习应用中，无全标签联邦学习问题非常重要。本文讨论了如何利用无标注数据的机器学习技术来解决此问题。我们对将联邦学习与半监督学习、自监督学习和迁移学习方法相结合的方法进行了综述。我们还总结了用于评估这些方法的数据集，并分析了它们的优点和局限性。",
