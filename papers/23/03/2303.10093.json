    "translated_abstract": "视觉语言预训练学习图像-标注配对之间的细粒度区域-词对齐，推动了开放词汇目标检测的进展。我们观察到，区域-词对齐方法通常仅针对目标名词在检测中使用，其他上下文，例如属性，对检测的影响不明确。在本研究中，我们探讨了语言上下文如何影响下游目标检测，并提议增强上下文的作用。特别地，我们展示了如何策略性地将接地预训练目标情境化以实现更好的对齐。我们进一步研究了属性作为特别有用的目标上下文并提出了一种新的基于形容词和名词的负采样策略，以增加对它们的对比学习的关注。总的来说，与区域-词预训练的最新技术相比，我们的方法提升了目标检测的效果。我们还通过文本-区域可视化显示属性敏感模型的细粒度实用性。",
