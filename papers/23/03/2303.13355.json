    "abstract": "Although the curse of multilinguality significantly restricts the language abilities of multilingual models in monolingual settings, researchers now still have to rely on multilingual models to develop state-of-the-art systems in Vietnamese Machine Reading Comprehension. This difficulty in researching is because of the limited number of high-quality works in developing Vietnamese language models. In order to encourage more work in this research field, we present a comprehensive analysis of language weaknesses and strengths of current Vietnamese monolingual models using the downstream task of Machine Reading Comprehension. From the analysis results, we suggest new directions for developing Vietnamese language models. Besides this main contribution, we also successfully reveal the existence of artifacts in Vietnamese Machine Reading Comprehension benchmarks and suggest an urgent need for new high-quality benchmarks to track the progress of Vietnamese Machine Reading Comprehension.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管多语言模型在单语言环境下的语言能力受到了很大限制，但研究人员仍然不得不依靠多语言模型来开发越南文机器阅读理解的最先进系统。这种研究困难是由于越南语言模型开发的高质量作品数量有限。为了鼓励在这个研究领域中进行更多的工作，我们使用机器阅读理解的下游任务，对当前越南单语言模型的语言弱点和优势进行了全面分析。从分析结果中，我们提出了发展越南语言模型的新方向。除了这个主要贡献外，我们还成功地揭示了越南机器阅读理解基准中存在的人工问题，并建议迫切需要新的高质量基准来跟踪越南机器阅读理解的进展。此外，我们还演示了越南机器阅读理解中无法回答的问题如何暴露语言建模的弱点，并评估模型的性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper reveals weaknesses in Vietnamese language models through the performance on unanswerable questions in machine reading comprehension, and suggests new directions for development. The authors also identify artifacts in Vietnamese machine reading comprehension benchmarks and highlight the need for new high-quality benchmarks to track progress. Finally, they demonstrate how unanswerable questions can expose weaknesses in language modeling and evaluate model performance."
