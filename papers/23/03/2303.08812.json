    "translated_abstract": "卷积神经网络（CNN）在科学数据分析中得到了广泛应用，包括在中微子望远镜中。然而，这些实验的数据对CNN提出了许多挑战，如非规则几何形状、稀疏性和高维度。因此，CNN在中微子望远镜数据上非常低效，并需要大量的预处理，导致信息损失。我们提出了稀疏子流形卷积（SSCNN）作为解决这些问题的方法，并显示SSCNN事件重构性能与传统和机器学习算法相比可比或更好。此外，我们的SSCNN在GPU上的运行速度约为传统CNN的16倍。由于这种加速，预计能够处理IceCube规模的中微子望远镜的触发级事件速率。这些网络可用于改善中微子能量和方向的第一估计以播种更先进的重建。",
