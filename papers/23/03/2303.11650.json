    "abstract": "This paper extends standard results from learning theory with independent data to sequences of dependent data. Contrary to most of the literature, we do not rely on mixing arguments or sequential measures of complexity and derive uniform risk bounds with classical proof patterns and capacity measures. In particular, we show that the standard classification risk bounds based on the VC-dimension hold in the exact same form for dependent data, and further provide Rademacher complexity-based bounds, that remain unchanged compared to the standard results for the identically and independently distributed case. Finally, we show how to apply these results in the context of scenario-based optimization in order to compute the sample complexity of random programs with dependent constraints.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文将独立数据的学习理论推广到了相关数据序列的情况。与大多数文献不同的是，我们不依赖于混合参数或者连续带参照的复杂度度量，而是采用了经典的证明模式和容量度量来推导统一的风险界限。特别地，我们展示了标准分类风险最小化理论在相关数据情况下的VC维界限。此外，我们还提供了基于R算子的复杂度界限，其与独立同分布情况下标准的界限没有变化。最后，我们展示了如何将这些结果应用于场景优化的情形，从而计算出具有相关约束的随机程序的样本复杂度。",
