    "translated_abstract": "基于EEG的活动和状态识别需要使用神经科学先前知识生成定量EEG特征，这可能限制BCI的性能。虽然基于神经网络的方法可以有效地提取特征，但它们经常会遇到诸如跨数据集的通用性差、高预测波动性和低模型可解释性等问题。因此，我们提出了一种新的轻量级多维注意力网络，称为LMDA-Net。通过结合两个专为EEG信号设计的新型注意力模块——通道注意力模块和深度注意力模块，LMDA-Net可以有效地整合来自多个维度的特征，从而提高了在各种BCI任务上的分类性能。 LMDA-Net在包括运动想象（MI）和P300-Speller范例在内的四个公开高影响力数据集上进行了评估，并与其他代表模型进行了比较。实验结果表明，LMDA-Net表现优于其他代表模型，实现了最先进的性能，并展示了其决策过程的高可解释性。",
