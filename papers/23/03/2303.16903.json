    "translated_abstract": "追踪单个分子对于量化药物在生物样本中的输送至关重要，例如在大脑药物输送研究中。既有的基于强度的定位方法不适用于扫描显微镜成像，通常用于体内成像。扫描双光子显微镜（Two-photon microscopy，2PM）成像的低信噪比、分子离开焦平面的运动和高运动模糊对于分子的准确定位构成了挑战。基于数据驱动的模型的应用由于体内实验的数据量通常很少而具有挑战性。为了补充稀缺的训练数据，我们开发了一个2PM图像模拟器。该模拟器模仿了体内成像中观察到的运动模糊、背景荧光和光子噪声。用合成数据训练数据驱动模型可以提高合成图像的定位质量，并解释为什么基于强度的方法失败。",
