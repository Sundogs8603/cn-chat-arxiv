    "translated_abstract": "美国最近对体育博彩进行了联邦合法化，这与机器学习的黄金时代相遇。如果博彩者能够利用数据准确地预测结果的概率，他们可以认识到何时书maker的赔率对他们有利。由于体育博彩仅在美国的市场上就是一个数十亿美元的行业，因此找到这样的机会可能会非常有利可图。许多研究人员已将机器学习应用于体育赛果预测问题，通常使用准确度来评估预测模型的性能。我们提出假设，对于体育博彩问题，模型校准比准确度更重要。为了测试这一假设，我们在多个赛季的NBA数据上对模型进行训练，并在单个赛季上使用已发布的赔率进行博彩实验。通过评估各种博彩系统，我们表明优化校准的预测模型比优化准确度平均带来更高的回报率（投资回报率为$110.42％$）。",
