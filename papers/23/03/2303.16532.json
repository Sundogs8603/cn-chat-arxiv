    "abstract": "It is a challenging problem to predict trends of futures prices with traditional econometric models as one needs to consider not only futures' historical data but also correlations among different futures. Spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have great advantages in dealing with such kind of spatial-temporal data. However, we cannot directly apply STGNNs to high-frequency future data because future investors have to consider both the long-term and short-term characteristics when doing decision-making. To capture both the long-term and short-term features, we exploit more label information by designing four heterogeneous tasks: price regression, price moving average regression, price gap regression (within a short interval), and change-point detection, which involve both long-term and short-term scenes. To make full use of these labels, we train our model in a continual manner. Traditional continual GNNs define the gradient of prices as the parameter important to overcome ca",

    "translated_abstract": "传统计量模型预测期货价格趋势是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为需要考虑到期货历史数据以及不同期货之间的关联。时空图神经网络在处理此类空间时间数据方面具有很大的优势。本研究通过设计四个异构任务来捕捉长期和短期特征：价格回归、移动平均价格回归、短时间内的价格差回归和变化点检测。为了充分利用这些标签，我们采用连续训练的方式对模型进行训练。",
