    "abstract": "Deep unsupervised approaches are gathering increased attention for applications such as pathology detection and segmentation in medical images since they promise to alleviate the need for large labeled datasets and are more generalizable than their supervised counterparts in detecting any kind of rare pathology. As the Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) literature continuously grows and new paradigms emerge, it is vital to continuously evaluate and benchmark new methods in a common framework, in order to reassess the state-of-the-art (SOTA) and identify promising research directions. To this end, we evaluate a diverse selection of cutting-edge UAD methods on multiple medical datasets, comparing them against the established SOTA in UAD for brain MRI. Our experiments demonstrate that newly developed feature-modeling methods from the industrial and medical literature achieve increased performance compared to previous work and set the new SOTA in a variety of modalities and datasets.

    "translated_abstract": "深度无监督方法正在越来越多地被用于医学图像中的病理检测和分割应用，因为它们承诺可以减轻对大规模标注数据集的需求，并且在检测任何一种罕见病理方面比有监督方法更具普适性。随着无监督异常检测 (UAD) 文献的不断增长和新的范式的出现，重要的是要在一个公共框架中不断地评估和基准测试新的方法，以重新评估最新技术进展，并确定有前途的研究方向。为此，我们在多个医学数据集上评估了多种尖端 UAD 方法，并将其与已在脑 MRI 的 UAD 中确立的最新技术进展进行比较。我们的实验表明，工业和医疗文献中新开发的特征建模方法相对于之前的工作实现了更高的性能，并在各种模态和数据集上创立了新的技术水平。",
