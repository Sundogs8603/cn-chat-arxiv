    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了On-chain市场活动和Off-chain数字货币市场定价（如ETH/USD价格）之间的相关理论和实证关系。我们的目标是开发使用原则上可验证的On-chain数据和计算代理Off-chain市场数据的方法，提供区块链价格oracle的替代方法。我们研究了PoW挖矿、PoS验证、区块空间市场、网络去中心化、使用和货币流通速度以及On-chain流动性池和AMMs的关系。我们从这些市场选择关键特征，通过图形模型、互信息和集成机器学习模型分析它们，以探索完全使用On-chain数据恢复Off-chain定价信息的程度。我们发现大量的定价信息包含在On-chain数据中，但通常很难恢复精确价格，除非在短时间重新训练模型。我们讨论了即使仅有局限的On-chain数据，我们也可以使用它们代理alpha价值的方法。",
