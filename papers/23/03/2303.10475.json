Two issues arise: first, collecting task-specific labeled examples does not apply to scenarios where tasks may be too complicated or costly to annotate, or the system is required to handle a new task immediately; second, this is not user-friendly since end-users are probably more willing to provide task description rather than a set of examples before using the system.

    "translated_abstract": "任务语义可以通过一组输入输出示例或一条文本指令来表达。传统的自然语言处理（NLP）机器学习方法主要依赖于大规模的任务特定示例的可用性。这引起了两个问题：首先，收集任务特定标记示例不适用于任务可能过于复杂或成本过高以进行注释的场景，或者系统需要立即处理新任务。其次，这不是用户友好的，因为最终用户可能更愿意在使用系统之前提供任务描述而不是一组示例。因此，社区对于自然语言处理中新的监督寻求范式--从任务指令学习--越来越感兴趣。尽管取得了令人印象深刻的进展，但社区仍然面临着一些共同的问题。本次调查旨在总结指导学习的当前研究，特别是回答以下问题：",
