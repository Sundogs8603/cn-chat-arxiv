    "abstract": "In this work we develop a novel approach using deep neural networks to reconstruct the conductivity distribution in elliptic problems from one internal measurement. The approach is based on a mixed reformulation of the governing equation and utilizes the standard least-squares objective to approximate the conductivity and flux simultaneously, with deep neural networks as ansatz functions. We provide a thorough analysis of the neural network approximations for both continuous and empirical losses, including rigorous error estimates that are explicit in terms of the noise level, various penalty parameters and neural network architectural parameters (depth, width and parameter bound). We also provide extensive numerical experiments in two- and multi-dimensions to illustrate distinct features of the approach, e.g., excellent stability with respect to data noise and capability of solving high-dimensional problems.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们使用深度神经网络开发了一种新的方法，从一个内部测量中重构椭圆问题中的导电率分布。该方法基于控制方程的混合改造，并利用标准的最小二乘目标函数同时近似导电率和通量，以深度神经网络作为试探函数。我们对连续和经验损失的神经网络逼近进行了深入的分析，包括通过噪声水平、各种惩罚参数和神经网络结构参数（深度、宽度和参数边界）显式地估计误差的严格估计。我们还进行了广泛的数值实验，以展示该方法的不同特点，例如对于数据噪声的优异稳定性以及解决高维问题的能力。",
