In order to build a better model, we propose a source separation-inspired description of computer network activity: at each time step, the observed graph is a mixture of subgraphs representing various sources of activity, and short-term dynamics result from changes in the mixing coefficients.

    "translated_abstract": "将企业计算机网络中的恶意活动检测视为一项时间链接预测任务：给定一系列代表主机之间通信的图表，目标是预测未来应该或不应该发生的边缘。然而，标准的时间链接预测算法不适用于计算机网络监测，因为它们没有考虑计算机网络活动的短期动态特性，这些特性表现出明显的季节性变化。为了建立一个更好的模型，我们提出了一种受源分离启发的计算机网络活动描述方法：在每个时间步骤，观察到的图是表示各种活动来源的子图的混合物，并且短期动态是由于混合系数的变化而产生的。定量和定性实验证明了我们方法的有效性。",
