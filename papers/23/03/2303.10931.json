    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种方法，通过探索无监督深度生成模型的潜在空间来发现数据中有意义的属性。我们将对单个潜在变量的操作与因果推断方法相结合，实现了一个称为极端值因果分离 (CDEV) 的方法，并展示了该方法对模型可解释性的洞察力。通过此技术，我们可以推断模型将未知数据编码为有意义的属性。我们将该方法应用于测试鲸鱼的通信系统中存在哪些有意义的属性，鲸鱼通信是最具有吸引力和研究不足的动物通信之一。我们训练了一个网络，该网络已被证明能够学习到有意义的语音表示，并测试是否可以利用这种无监督学习来解析另一个我们没有地面真相的声音通信系统的属性。所提出的技术表明，鲸鱼在其声音通信中存在语法，这是以前不知道的。",
