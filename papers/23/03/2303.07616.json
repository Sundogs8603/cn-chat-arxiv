    "abstract": "Knowledge plays a critical role in artificial intelligence. Recently, the extensive success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has raised significant attention about how knowledge can be acquired, maintained, updated and used by language models. Despite the enormous amount of related studies, there still lacks a unified view of how knowledge circulates within language models throughout the learning, tuning, and application processes, which may prevent us from further understanding the connections between current progress or realizing existing limitations. In this survey, we revisit PLMs as knowledge-based systems by dividing the life circle of knowledge in PLMs into five critical periods, and investigating how knowledge circulates when it is built, maintained and used. To this end, we systematically review existing studies of each period of the knowledge life cycle, summarize the main challenges and current limitations, and discuss future directions.",

    "translated_abstract": "知识在人工智能中起着至关重要的作用。最近，预训练语言模型（PLMs）的广泛成功引起了人们对语言模型如何获取、维护、更新和使用知识的重视。尽管有大量相关研究，但仍然缺乏一个统一的视角来了解知识在学习、调整和应用过程中在语言模型内部如何循环，这可能阻碍我们进一步了解当前进展的联系或实现现有限制。在本综述中，我们将PLMs重新视为基于知识的系统，将PLMs中知识的生命周期分为五个关键时期，并调查了知识在建立、维护和使用时的循环方式。为此，我们系统地审查了知识生命周期的每个时期的现有研究，总结了主要挑战和当前限制，并讨论了未来的方向。",
