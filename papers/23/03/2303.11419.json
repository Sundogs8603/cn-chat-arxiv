    "translated_abstract": "对于真实应用中的点云分类来说，由于消费型3D传感器通常采集的是部分和带有噪声的数据，且会受到各种因素的影响而变得降质。本文提出了一种基于部分点云采样的通用集成框架。每个集成成员只暴露于部分输入数据。我们同时使用两种基于补丁和曲线的局部采样策略以及一种全局的随机采样策略。我们证明了我们的方法对各种局部和全局污染具有很强的鲁棒性。我们展示了我们的框架极大地提高了顶级分类网络的鲁棒性。我们的实验设置使用了Ren等人[24]引入的最新ModelNet-C数据库，在不经过数据增强和经过数据增强的情况下都达到了最优（SOTA）。我们的未经数据增强的均值腐蚀误差（mCE）为0.64（当前SOTA为0.86），经过数据增强后为0.50（当前SOTA为0.57）。我们通过多样性和可视化分析了这些显著的结果。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a general ensemble framework based on partial point cloud sampling for robust point cloud classification. The framework significantly improves the robustness of top classification networks by jointly using three sampling strategies. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both unaugmented and augmented data, surpassing the current SOTA."
