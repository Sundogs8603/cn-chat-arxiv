    "abstract": "In this paper, we extend the existing double linear policy by incorporating time-varying weights instead of constant weights and study a certain robustness property, called robust positive expectation (RPE), in a discrete-time setting. We prove that the RPE property holds by employing a novel elementary symmetric polynomials characterization approach and derive an explicit expression for both the expected cumulative gain-loss function and its variance. To validate our theory, we perform extensive Monte Carlo simulations using various weighting functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this policy can be effectively incorporated with standard technical analysis techniques, using the moving average as a trading signal.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文将时间变化权重引入现有的双线性策略，并在离散时间情况下研究了一种称为稳健正期望（RPE）的稳健性质。我们采用一种新颖的元素对称多项式表征方法证明RPE属性成立，并得出预期累计收益损失函数及其方差的显式表达式。为验证我们的理论，我们使用各种权重函数进行了广泛的蒙特卡罗模拟。此外，我们演示了如何使用移动平均线作为交易信号，将此策略有效地与标准技术分析技术结合起来。",
