    "abstract": "Purpose - To characterise and assess the quality of published research evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) methods for ovarian cancer diagnosis or prognosis using histopathology data. Methods - A search of 5 sources was conducted up to 01/12/2022. The inclusion criteria required that research evaluated AI on histopathology images for diagnostic or prognostic inferences in ovarian cancer, including tubo-ovarian and peritoneal tumours. Reviews and non-English language articles were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed for every included model using PROBAST. Results - A total of 1434 research articles were identified, of which 36 were eligible for inclusion. These studies reported 62 models of interest, including 35 classifiers, 14 survival prediction models, 7 segmentation models, and 6 regression models. Models were developed using 1-1375 slides from 1-664 ovarian cancer patients. A wide array of outcomes were predicted, including overall survival (9/62), histological subtypes (7",

    "translated_abstract": "目的-特征化和评估已发表的研究，评估利用组织病理学数据进行卵巢癌诊断或预后的人工智能（AI）方法的质量。方法-在2022年1月12日之前，对5个来源进行搜索。包括标准要求研究评估AI在卵巢癌的组织病理学图像上，对卵巢癌，包括输卵管卵巢和腹膜肿瘤的诊断或预后推断。排除评论和非英语文章。对每个包含的模型使用PROBAST评估偏倚风险。结果-共发现1434篇研究文章，其中36篇符合纳入标准。这些研究报告了62个感兴趣的模型，其中包括35个分类器，14个生存预测模型，7个分割模型和6个回归模型。使用1-1375张从1-664个卵巢癌患者中得到的幻灯片开发了这些模型。预测了广泛的结果，包括总体生存（9/62），组织学亚型（7/62）和淋巴结状态（6/62）。结论-基于可用的文献，AI模型在卵巢癌组织病理学的诊断和预后中显示出有希望的结果。但是，现有的研究受到样本量小、潜在的偏见和缺乏外部验证的限制。",
