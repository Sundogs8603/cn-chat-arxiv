    "translated_abstract": "相位像差是超声成像质量下降的主要原因之一，由介质中声速的空间变化引起。这种效应破坏了传输波并阻止回波信号的相干叠加，导致图像质量低下。在实际实验中，获得非像差的基础真值可能会极具挑战性，如果不是不可能的话。这种效应阻碍了基于深度学习的相位像差修复技术的表现，因为仅依赖于模拟数据以及模拟和实验数据之间存在领域转移。在这里，我们首次提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，它不需要参考数据来补偿相位误差效应。我们训练了一个网络，其中输入和目标输出都是随机畸变的射频（RF）数据。此外，我们证明传统损失函数，如均方误差，对于训练网络以获取可实现的相位修复是不充分的。",
