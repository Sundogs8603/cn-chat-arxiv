    "abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT) toxicities can impair survival and quality-of-life, yet remain under-studied. Real-world evidence holds potential to improve our understanding of toxicities, but toxicity information is often only in clinical notes. We developed natural language processing (NLP) models to identify the presence and severity of esophagitis from notes of patients treated with thoracic RT. We fine-tuned statistical and pre-trained BERT-based models for three esophagitis classification tasks: Task 1) presence of esophagitis, Task 2) severe esophagitis or not, and Task 3) no esophagitis vs. grade 1 vs. grade 2-3. Transferability was tested on 345 notes from patients with esophageal cancer undergoing RT.  Fine-tuning PubmedBERT yielded the best performance. The best macro-F1 was 0.92, 0.82, and 0.74 for Task 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Selecting the most informative note sections during fine-tuning improved macro-F1 by over 2% for all tasks. Silver-labeled data improved the macro-F1 by over 3",

    "translated_abstract": "放射治疗（RT）毒性反应会影响患者的生存和生活质量，但研究还不足。现实世界的证据有望改善我们对毒性反应的认识，但毒性信息通常仅存在于临床记录中。本文开发了自然语言处理（NLP）模型，用于从接受胸部 RT 治疗的患者的记录中识别食管炎的存在和严重程度。我们对三个食管炎分类任务进行了统计和预训练 BERT 模型的微调：任务 1）食管炎的存在，任务 2）重度食管炎或否，以及任务 3）无食管炎 vs. 一级 vs. 二三级。我们使用接受食管癌放疗的 345 份患者记录进行了可迁移性测试。使用 PubmedBERT 进行微调取得了最佳性能。任务 1、任务 2 和任务 3 的最佳宏 F1 分别为 0.92、0.82 和 0.74。在微调过程中选择最信息量的记录部分，可将宏 F1 提高超过 2%。银标记数据将宏 F1 提高超过 3 个百分点。",
