    "translated_abstract": "真实世界的视觉数据呈现出固有的分层结构，这些结构可以在双曲空间中有效地表示。双曲神经网络是在这种空间中学习特征表示的一种有前途的方法。然而，计算机视觉中的当前方法依赖于欧几里得骨干，并且仅在任务头中将特征投影到双曲空间中，限制了它们充分利用双曲几何的好处的能力。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了HCNN，这是第一个专为计算机视觉任务设计的完全双曲卷积神经网络（CNN）。基于洛伦兹模型，我们推广了CNN的基本组件，并提出了卷积层、批量归一化和多项式逻辑回归（MLR）的新公式。在标准视觉任务的实验中，我们展示了我们的HCNN框架和洛伦兹模型在混合和完全双曲设置中的有效性。总的来说，我们旨在为将来在双曲几何中进行的研究铺平道路。",
