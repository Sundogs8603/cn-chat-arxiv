    "translated_abstract": "针对物理世界的攻击（如对抗性patch），防御措施的研究越来越受到研究界的重视。我们通过引入基于不确定性的对抗性patch本地化器来为对抗性patch检测领域做出贡献，该本地化器可以在图像上定位对抗性patch，允许进行后处理的patch避免或patch重建。我们通过开发“超出阈值不确定性检测”（DUET）算法来量化我们的预测不确定性。这个算法提供了一个框架来确定对抗性patch本地化的信心，这对于安全敏感的应用，如自动驾驶汽车和医学成像非常重要。我们对本地化对抗性patch进行了实验，并发现我们提出的DUET模型优于基线模型。然后我们对我们所选择的模型先验和不同语言中贝叶斯神经网络的采用进行了进一步的分析。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes an uncertainty-based adversarial patch localizer algorithm called DUET, which can locate adversarial patches on an image, allowing for post-processing patch-avoidance or patch-reconstruction. It provides a framework to ascertain confidence in the adversarial patch localization, which is essential for safety-sensitive applications such as self-driving cars and medical imaging. The DUET model outperforms baseline models and further analysis on model priors and Bayesian Neural Networks in different languages is conducted."
