    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了MPC策略逼近的数据生成问题。从专家演示中学习一个近似的MPC策略需要一个大型数据集，其中包含跨可行状态空间采样的最优状态-动作对。然而，有效地生成训练样本的关键挑战尚未得到广泛研究。最近，提出了一种基于敏感度的MPC策略逼近数据增强框架，利用参数敏感度从单个离线MPC计算中廉价地生成多个额外样本。通过使用不精确样本增强训练数据集的误差被证明随着数据增强的邻域大小的增加而增加。在此基础上，本文提出了一种基于预测校正步骤的改进数据增强方案，可以强制执行用户定义的精度级别，并且显示出增强样本的误差界独立于邻域大小。",

The scheme enforces a user-defined level of accuracy, and the error bound of the augmented samples are shown to be independent of the neighborhood size used for data augmentation."
