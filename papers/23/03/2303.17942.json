    "translated_abstract": "经典的机器学习技术需要在单个数据湖中训练数据。然而，聚合来自不同所有者的数据并不总是方便的，原因包括安全、隐私和保密。数据具有一定的价值，与他人共享时可能会消失；避免共享数据的能力使得工业应用成为可能，其中安全和隐私至关重要，只需实现本地策略即可训练全局模型，这些策略可以独立运行甚至在离线数据中心运行。联邦学习（FL）是一种分布式机器学习方法，通过仅共享本地AI模型并保持数据分散来解决隐私问题，已成为解决隐私问题的有效方法。联邦学习的两个重要挑战是管理同一联合网络中的异构系统并处理实际数据，这些数据在客户端之间通常不是独立和同分布的（non-IID）。",
