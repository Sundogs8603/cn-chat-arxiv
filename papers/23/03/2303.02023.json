    "translated_abstract": "图机器学习模型已经成功应用于多个应用领域。最突出的一类模型——图神经网络（GNNs）提供了一种优雅的方式来提取表达性的节点级表示向量，这些向量可以用来解决节点相关的问题，例如在社交网络中对用户进行分类。然而，许多任务需要整个图的表示，例如在分子应用中。为了将节点级表示转换为图级向量，必须应用所谓的读出函数。在这项工作中，我们研究了现有的读出方法，包括简单的非可训练方法以及复杂的参数化模型。我们引入了集成读出函数的概念，这些函数可以结合表示或预测。我们的实验表明，这样的集成可以比简单单一的读出函数表现得更好，或者与复杂的参数化方法表现相似，但开销只有它们的一小部分。",
