    "translated_abstract": "分析细胞形态的动态变化对于理解活细胞（包括干细胞和转移性癌症细胞）的各种功能和特性至关重要。为此，我们需要在每个活细胞视频帧上跟踪细胞轮廓上的所有点。轮廓上的局部形状和纹理不明显，其运动复杂，常常伴随局部轮廓特征的扩张和收缩。目前光流或深度点集跟踪的先前工作由于细胞的流动性而不适用，以前的深度轮廓跟踪也没有考虑点对应。我们提出了第一种基于深度学习的细胞（或更一般的粘弹性材料）轮廓跟踪，通过融合两个轮廓之间的密集表示和交叉关注实现点对应。由于手动标记轮廓上的密集跟踪点是不现实的，因此采用了机械和循环一致性损失的非监督学习方法。所提出的方法在合成和实验数据集上进行评估，并在精度和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法，展示了其在活细胞成像应用中的潜力。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning method that tracks all points on the cellular contour by utilizing mechanical and cyclical consistency losses, outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. Additionally, the proposed method considers point correspondence for the first time and has the potential to be applied in live cell imaging."
