    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the nature of the density metric, which is employed in the literature on smart specialization and the product space. We find that although density is supposed to capture relatedness between a country's current specialization pattern and potential products that it may diversify into, density is also correlated strongly to the level of diversification of the country, and (less strongly) to the ubiquity of the product. Together, diversity and ubiquity capture 93% of the variance of density. We split density into a part that corresponds to related variety, and a part that does not (i.e., unrelated variety). In regressions for predicting gain or loss of specialization, both these parts are significant. The relative influence of related variety increases with the level of diversification of the country: only countries that are already diversified show a strong influence of related variety. In our empirical analysis, we put equal emphasis on gains and losses of s",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了密度度量在智能专业化和产品空间文献中的性质。我们发现，尽管密度应该捕捉一个国家当前专业化模式和其可能多元化的潜在产品之间的相关性，但密度也与该国的多元化程度强相关，并且（较少）与产品的普遍性相关。 多样性和普遍性共同解释了93％的密度差异。我们将密度分为对应相关变量的部分和不对应的无关变量的部分。在预测专业化增益或损失的回归中，这两部分都是显著的。相关多样性的相对影响随着国家多元化水平的提高而增加：只有已经实现多元化的国家才显示出相关多样性的强烈影响。在我们的实证分析中，我们同样强调了专业化的增益和损失",
