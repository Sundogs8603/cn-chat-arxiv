    "abstract": "The usage and impact of deep learning for cleaner production and sustainability purposes remain little explored. This work shows how deep learning can be harnessed to increase sustainability in production and product usage. Specifically, we utilize deep learning-based computer vision to determine the wear states of products. The resulting insights serve as a basis for novel product-service systems with improved integration and result orientation. Moreover, these insights are expected to facilitate product usage improvements and R&D innovations. We demonstrate our approach on two products: machining tools and rotating X-ray anodes. From a technical standpoint, we show that it is possible to recognize the wear state of these products using deep-learning-based computer vision. In particular, we detect wear through microscopic images of the two products. We utilize a U-Net for semantic segmentation to detect wear based on pixel granularity. The resulting mean dice coefficients of 0.631 and",
