    "translated_abstract": "在学术界中，科学家数量每年都在增加，同名作者数量也相应增加，因此将新发表的论文分配给对应的作者是一项具有挑战性的任务。因此，作者姓名模糊性(ANA) 是数字图书馆中一个关键的开放问题。本文提出了一种作者姓名消歧(AND)方法，通过利用作者的合作者和研究领域，将作者姓名链接到他们的真实实体上。为此，我们使用DBLP仓库中收集的数据，该仓库包含约260万个共同作者撰写的超过500万个文献记录。我们的方法首先将相同姓氏和相同名字首字母的作者分组。在每个组中，通过捕获作者与他/她的合作者和研究领域之间的关系，由对应作者的验证出版物的标题进行表示，以确定每个组中的作者。为此，我们训练了一种神经网络模型，该模型从数据中学习。",
