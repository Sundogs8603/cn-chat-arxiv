    "abstract": "We present the ASP-based visualization tool $\\textit{clingraph}$ which aims at visualizing various concepts of ASP by means of ASP itself. This idea traces back to the $\\textit{aspviz}$ tool and $\\textit{clingraph}$ redevelops and extends it in the context of modern ASP systems. More precisely, $\\textit{clingraph}$ takes graph specifications in terms of ASP facts and hands them over to the graph visualization system $\\textit{graphviz}$. The use of ASP provides a great interface between logic programs and/or answer sets and their visualization. Also, $\\textit{clingraph}$ offers a $\\textit{python}$ API that extends this ease of interfacing to $\\textit{clingo}$'s API, and in turn to connect and monitor various aspects of the solving process.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了基于ASP的可视化工具clingraph，它旨在通过ASP本身来可视化ASP的各种概念。这个想法可以追溯到aspviz工具，而clingraph则在现代ASP系统的背景下重新开发和扩展它。更精确地说，clingraph通过ASP事实的图形规范将它们传递给图形可视化系统graphviz。ASP的使用提供了逻辑程序和/或答案集及其可视化之间的极好接口。另外，clingraph提供了一个Python API，扩展了这种易于接口化到clingo的API，从而连接和监视求解过程的各个方面。",
