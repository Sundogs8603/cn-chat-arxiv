    "translated_abstract": "无线通信系统中的联合信道估计和信号检测是一个关键且具有挑战性的任务，特别是因为它固有地涉及非线性逆问题。在低信噪比的情况下，传统算法往往效果不佳，这进一步凸显了这一挑战。深度学习方法已经得到了研究，但是人们对计算费用和在低信噪比环境中缺乏验证的担忧依然存在。因此，开发一个强大且低复杂度的模型，能够在广泛的信噪比范围内提供出色的性能，非常有意义。在本文中，我们旨在建立一个基准，在不同的信道模型、多普勒和信噪比设置下验证传统算法和深度学习方法。特别地，我们提出了一个新的深度学习模型，其中的骨架网络由展开迭代算法形成，并通过超网络估计超参数。此外，我们还将轻量级的DenseNet调整为适应联合信道估计和信号检测任务。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study compares the performance of deep learning and iterative algorithms for joint channel estimation and signal detection. A new deep learning model is proposed, which unrolls the iterative algorithm and uses hypernetworks to estimate hyperparameters, while also adapting to low signal-to-noise ratio environments. The results show that this model achieves excellent performance across different channel models and signal-to-noise ratio ranges."
