    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络已经在协同过滤任务中展示出了其在图结构用户-物品交互数据上表示学习的能力。然而，由于低通Laplacian平滑算子的过度平滑和噪声效应，现有的基于GNN的CF模型可能会生成难以区分且不准确的用户（物品）表示。为解决这些限制，本文提出了一个简单而有效的协同过滤模型（SimRec），将知识蒸馏和对比学习的能力融合在一起，实现了教师GNN模型与轻量级学生网络之间的自适应知识转移，在不需要构建图的情况下更好地发现用户和物品之间的相互关系。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a graph-less collaborative filtering model called SimRec, which combines knowledge distillation and contrastive learning to enable adaptive knowledge transfer between a teacher GNN model and a lightweight student network. It effectively addresses the over-smoothing and noise effect issues with existing GNN-based CF models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets."
