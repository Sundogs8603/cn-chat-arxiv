    "translated_abstract": "传统的计算机图形学渲染和反渲染算法已被神经表示（NR）所取代。NR最近被用于学习场景的几何和材质属性，并使用这些信息合成真实的图像，因此承诺用可伸缩的质量和可预测的性能替换传统的渲染算法。本文提出问题：神经图形（NG）是否需要硬件支持？我们研究了代表性的NG应用程序，发现如果我们要在当前的GPU上以60FPS渲染4K分辨率，则所需性能与当前GPU的实际性能存在1.5倍至55倍的差距。对于增强现实/虚拟现实应用程序，所需性能与所需系统功率之间存在更大的差距。我们确定输入编码和MLP内核是性能瓶颈，对于多分辨率哈希网格、多分辨率密集网格和低分辨率密集网格，它们占应用程序时间的72％、60％和59％。",
