    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是一种新兴的分布式学习技术，允许网络中的多个客户端设备在不直接暴露客户数据的情况下共同训练一个机器学习模型，由于其隐私保护的性质而备受关注。然而，在联邦学习中训练的模型通常表现不如在标准集中式学习模式下训练的模型，特别是在训练数据不平衡的情况下。在联邦学习中，数据失衡可能在单个客户端设备上发生，也可能在许多设备上全局发生。不同类型数据不平衡的复杂性给联邦学习技术的发展带来了挑战，尤其是考虑到需要同时缓解数据不平衡问题和保护数据隐私。因此，许多尝试已经在文献中对联邦学习中的类别不平衡进行了处理。本文对这一问题的最新进展进行了详细回顾，包括平衡感知优化、数据增强和客户端加权。我们还讨论了解决联邦学习中类别不平衡问题的开放问题和潜在研究方向。",
