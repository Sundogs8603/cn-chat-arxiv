    "title": "(1+1) Genetic Programming With Functionally Complete Instruction Sets Can Evolve Boolean Conjunctions and Disjunctions with Arbitrarily Small Error. (arXiv:2303.07455v1 [cs.NE])",
    "abstract": "Recently it has been proven that simple GP systems can efficiently evolve a conjunction of $n$ variables if they are equipped with the minimal required components. In this paper, we make a considerable step forward by analysing the behaviour and performance of a GP system for evolving a Boolean conjunction or disjunction of $n$ variables using a complete function set that allows the expression of any Boolean function of up to $n$ variables. First we rigorously prove that a GP system using the complete truth table to evaluate the program quality, and equipped with both the AND and OR operators and positive literals, evolves the exact target function in $O(\\ell n \\log^2 n)$ iterations in expectation, where $\\ell \\geq n$ is a limit on the size of any accepted tree. Additionally, we show that when a polynomial sample of possible inputs is used to evaluate the solution quality, conjunctions or disjunctions with any polynomially small generalisation error can be evolved with probability $1 -",
