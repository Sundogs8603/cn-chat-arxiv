    "translated_abstract": "颅内出血是一种严重的健康问题，需要快速且常常非常密集的医疗治疗。为了诊断，通常要进行颅部计算机断层扫描（CCT）扫描。然而，由于辐射引起的增加的健康风险是一个问题。降低这种潜在风险的最重要策略是尽可能保持辐射剂量低，并与诊断任务一致。 稀疏视图CT可以通过减少所采集的视图总数，从而降低剂量，是一种有效的策略，但代价是降低图像质量。在这项工作中，我们使用U-Net架构来减少稀疏视图CCT的伪影，从稀疏视图中预测完全采样的重建图像。我们使用一个卷积神经网络对出血的检测和分类进行评估，并在完全采样的CCT上进行训练。我们的结果表明，伪影降噪后的CCT图像进行自动分类和检测的准确性与完全采样的CCT图像没有明显差异。",
