    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个规划框架，用于针对在无知防御者情况下运作的攻击者生成防御策略。防御者的目标是悄悄地指导攻击者陷入陷阱状态，从而使攻击者无法实现其目标。此外，防御者只有在K步内达成其目标，其中K是在此内攻击者不太可能怀疑环境威胁的保守下界。这种防御策略在蜜罐或蜜网等实际系统中非常有用，其中一个毫无戒心的攻击者与模拟生产系统交互，同时假设它是真实的生产系统。通常，攻击者和防御者之间的交互使用博弈理论框架捕获。我们的问题公式允许我们将其捕获为一个更简单的无限地图折扣MDP，其中通过值迭代获得了MDP问题的最优策略。我们在多种设置中评估了所提出的方法，证明了其在找到防御策略并保持攻击者陷入困境方面的有效性。",
