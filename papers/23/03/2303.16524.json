    "translated_abstract": "煤柱是确保地下硬岩矿山安全的重要结构单元。因此，需要对地下柱子的稳定性进行精确的预测。一个常用的评估柱子稳定性的指标是安全系数（SF）。不幸的是，使用SF进行柱子稳定性评估时，常常出现清晰的边界不可靠的情况。本文提出了一种新颖的人工神经网络反向传播（ANN-BP）和深度集成学习在柱子稳定性分类中的应用。柱子稳定性的分类有三种ANN-BP，分别由其激活函数区分：ANN-BP ReLU、ANN-BP ELU和ANN-BP GELU。本研究还提出了一种新的标签替代方案，通过考虑其与SF的适应性来考虑柱子的稳定性。因此，柱子稳定性分为四个类别：具有适当的安全系数而失败、具有适当的安全系数而完好、不具有适当的安全系数而失败和不具有适当的安全系数而完好。",
