    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种破译历史词典大量手写索引卡的方法。我们提供了一个可工作的解决方案，读取这些索引卡，并将它们的引文链接到可搜索的词典条目列表，用于一个名为“17世纪和18世纪波兰语词典”的大型历史词典，其包括280万个索引卡。我们应用了量身定制的手写文本识别解决方案，包括（1）优化的检测模型；（2）用于解密手写内容的识别模型，设计为一个空间变换网络(STN)，后跟一层卷积神经网络（RCNN）和一个联结时序分类层(CTC)，使用一个由50万个不同长度的波兰语单词生成的合成数据集进行训练； (3) 使用受限制的Word Beam Search(WBC)进行后处理:预测被与事先已知的词典条目列表匹配。我们的模型在单词级别的准确度上达到了0.881。",
