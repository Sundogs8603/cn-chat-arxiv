    "translated_abstract": "在音乐等消费领域，用户通常能够更有效地提供对一组项目（例如播放列表或广播）的偏好而不是对单个项目（例如歌曲）。不幸的是，这是一个未被充分研究的领域，大多数现有的推荐系统仅限于了解单个项目的偏好。我们提出了一种新的数据收集方法，通过观察项目级和集合级反馈，有效地在会话环境中收集关于项目集的真实偏好信息。我们将这项任务称为对话式项目集合作，并将其应用于音乐推荐，构建了对话式播放列表构建数据集（CPC）。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种有效收集用户对项目集偏好数据的方法，用于构建对话式播放列表构建数据集。该数据集能够超越单项偏好，更加全面有效地了解用户需求。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new method for efficiently collecting user preference data about item sets in a conversational setting, which is used to build the Conversational Playlist Curation Dataset (CPC) for music recommendation. This dataset allows for a more comprehensive and effective understanding of user needs beyond single item preferences."
