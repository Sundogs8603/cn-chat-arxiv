    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）已经在科学界掀起风暴，改变了自然语言处理和人机交互的现状。这些强大的工具可以回答复杂的问题，出奇地完成有挑战性的创造性任务（例如，生成代码和应用程序来解决问题，写故事、音乐片段等）。在本文中，我们提出了一种结合交互式进化和大型语言模型的协作游戏设计框架，以模拟典型的人类设计过程。我们使用前者利用用户的反馈选择最有前途的想法，使用大型语言模型进行非常复杂的创造性任务——思想的重组和变异。在我们的框架中，过程始于一个简要说明和一组候选设计，这些设计是使用语言模型生成的，或由用户提出的。接下来，用户通过向交互式遗传算法提供反馈来协作设计过程，该算法选择、重组和突变设计。",
