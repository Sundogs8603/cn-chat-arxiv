    "abstract": "Although reinforcement learning has seen tremendous success recently, this kind of trial-and-error learning can be impractical or inefficient in complex environments. The use of demonstrations, on the other hand, enables agents to benefit from expert knowledge rather than having to discover the best action to take through exploration. In this survey, we discuss the advantages of using demonstrations in sequential decision making, various ways to apply demonstrations in learning-based decision making paradigms (for example, reinforcement learning and planning in the learned models), and how to collect the demonstrations in various scenarios. Additionally, we exemplify a practical pipeline for generating and utilizing demonstrations in the recently proposed ManiSkill robot learning benchmark.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管强化学习最近取得了巨大的成功，但是这种试错式的学习方法在复杂环境下可能效率低下。与此相反，使用示范可以让智能体受益于专家的知识，而无需探索最佳行动。在本综述中，我们讨论了在顺序决策中使用示范的优点，以及学习为基础的决策制定范式（例如，强化学习和规划在学习的模型中如何应用示范），以及如何在各种情况下收集示范。此外，我们还举了一个实际的示范生成和利用管道的例子，并在最近提出的ManiSkill机器人学习基准中进行了说明。",
