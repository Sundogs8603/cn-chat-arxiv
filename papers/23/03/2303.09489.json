    "translated_abstract": "时间序列建模是一个已被广泛研究的问题，通常需要方法具备以下三个特性：表达复杂依赖关系，预测远期，以及有效训练长序列。状态空间模型（SSMs）是时间序列的经典模型，之前的工作将SSMs与深度学习层结合，以实现高效的序列建模。然而，我们发现这些先前方法存在根本上的限制，证明了它们的SSM表示不能表达自回归的时间序列过程。因此，我们介绍了SpaceTime，一种新的状态空间时间序列架构，改进了所有三个特性。为了提高表现力，我们提出了一种基于伴随矩阵的新的SSM参数化方法——离散时间过程的规范表示——它使得SpaceTime的SSM层能够学习称心的自回归过程。为了预测远期，我们介绍了一个“闭环”变体的伴随SSM，使得SpaceTime能够预测许多将来的时间点。",
