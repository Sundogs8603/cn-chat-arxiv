In this study, we propose a robust SR model called Miipher, and apply Miipher to a new SR application: increasing the amount of high-quality training data for speech generation by converting speech samples collected from the Web to studio-quality. To make our SR model robust against various degradation, we use (i) a speech representation extracted from w2v-BERT for the input feature, and (ii) a text representation extracted from transcripts via PnG-BERT as a linguistic conditioning feature. Experiments show that Miipher (i) is robust against various audio degradation and (ii) enable us to train a high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) model from restored speech samples collected from the Web.

    "translated_abstract": "语音修复（SR）是将受损的语音信号转换为高质量语音的任务。在本研究中，我们提出了一种称为Miipher的稳健SR模型，并将Miipher应用于一个新的SR应用：通过将从网络上收集的语音样本转换为工作室质量，增加高质量训练数据用于语音生成。为了使我们的SR模型对各种降解具有鲁棒性，我们使用了（i）从w2v-BERT提取的语音表示作为输入特征，以及（ii）通过PnG-BERT从转录中提取的文本表示作为语言条件特征。实验结果表明，Miipher（i）对各种音频降解具有鲁棒性，并且（ii）使我们能够从从网络上收集的修复后的语音样本中训练出高质量的文本到语音（TTS）模型。音频样本可在我们的演示页面上找到：google.github.io/df-conformer/miipher/",
