    "translated_abstract": "电子、光学和扫描探针显微镜技术正在产生越来越多的图像数据，这些数据包含原子和中等尺度结构和功能的信息。这需要开发机器学习方法，从数据中发现物理和化学现象，例如电子和扫描隧道显微镜图像中对称性破缺的表现，纳米颗粒的变异性。变分自编码器（VAE）正在成为一种强大的无监督数据分析范例，允许分解变量因素并发现最佳简洁表示。在这里，我们总结了VAEs的最新发展，涵盖了VAEs背后的基本原理和直觉。介绍了不变VAEs作为一种适应于成像数据中的尺度和平移不变性并将已知变化因素与待发现因素分开的方法。我们进一步描述了不变VAEs在解决图像分析问题方面的机会，包括发现对称性破缺现象和识别化学功能。",
