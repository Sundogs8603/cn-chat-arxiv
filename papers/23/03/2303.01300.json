    "translated_abstract": "随着智能系统在自主行为或增强人类活动方面的普及，考虑人类、自主系统或两者都会因多种因素之一（例如感知）而出现失败的情况非常重要。无论是人类还是自主代理的失败都可能导致降低性能水平，甚至严重到导致伤害或死亡。本文考虑了混合人工智能团队的情况，其中管理代理负责识别何时执行委派任务以及人类或自主系统是否应该掌控。在这种情况下，管理者将根据他们的感知能力和可能的缺陷，估计最佳行动，以预测人工智能和人类代理的失败几率。我们模拟环境背景如何导致或加剧感知能力的缺陷，以提供情况。",
    "tldr": "本文探讨了人工智能与人类混合系统中的感知失败问题，提出了通过委派管理代理来选择人类或自主系统控制，以补偿可能发生的感知缺失，保障系统安全的方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper discusses the problem of sensing failures in human-AI hybrid systems, proposes a method of compensating for possible sensory deficiencies and ensuring system safety by delegating the managing agent to choose between human and autonomous system control."
