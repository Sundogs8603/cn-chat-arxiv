    "translated_abstract": "个性化联邦学习（PFL）作为一种流行的分布式学习范式，允许个性化模型通过利用所有分布式客户端的知识来提高泛化能力和鲁棒性。大多数现有的PFL算法采用基于模型的方法来解决个性化问题，例如个性化的层划分、模型正则化和模型插值，这些方法都无法考虑到分布式客户端的数据特征。本文提出了一种新颖的用于图像分类任务的PFL框架pFedPT，它利用个性化的视觉提示来隐含地表示客户端的本地数据分布信息，并将该信息提供给聚合模型来帮助分类任务。具体来说，在pFedPT训练的每一轮中，每个客户端都会生成与本地数据分布相关的个性化本地提示，然后在由原始数据和视觉提示组成的输入上训练本地模型以学习分布式数据特征，最后将视觉提示发送到集中式聚合器以更新全局模型。在几个基准测试数据集上的实验结果表明，相对于其他最先进的PFL算法，pFedPT具有更好的效果。",
