    "translated_abstract": "目前有限的证据表明，健康干预对认知功能和教育成果的影响很小。本文在两项先前的系统评价基础上进行荟萃分析，探讨疟疾化学预防这一最重要的健康干预对教育成果的影响。我们汇集了来自四个国家的九个研究治疗组（N=4,075）的数据和结果。我们发现，低成本的疟疾化学预防对学生的认知功能有积极影响（Cohen's d = 0.12, 95% CI [0.08, 0.16]）。这些结果表明，疟疾化学预防在提高某些认知技能（如持续注意力）方面具有极高的成本效益。此外，我们使用一种新的公共度量（学习调整发展年限）进行模拟，以比较各种干预措施的成本效益。尽管我们可能期望传统的教育干预措施提供立即的学习收益，但像疟疾预防这样的健康干预措施在教育成果方面具有惊人的成本效益。",
