    "translated_abstract": "深度点云配准方法面临着局部重叠的挑战，并且依赖于标记数据。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了UDPReg，一种用于部分重叠点云的无监督深度概率配准框架。具体而言，我们首先采用网络从点云中学习高斯混合模型（GMM）的后验概率分布。为了处理局部点云配准，我们采用Sinkhorn算法在GMM的混合权重约束下预测分布级对应关系。为了实现无监督学习，我们设计了三种基于分布一致性的损失函数：自一致性、交一致性和局部对比。自一致性损失通过鼓励Euclidean和特征空间的GMM共享相同的后验分布来形成；交一致性损失源于两个部分重叠点云的点属于相同簇的事实，它们共享簇中心。",
