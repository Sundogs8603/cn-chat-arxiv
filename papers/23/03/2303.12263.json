    "abstract": "In games with incomplete and ambiguous information, rational behavior depends not only on fundamental ambiguity (ambiguity about states) but also on strategic ambiguity (ambiguity about others' actions). We study the impact of strategic ambiguity in global games. Ambiguous-quality information makes more players choose an action yielding a constant payoff, whereas (unambiguous) low-quality information makes more players choose an ex-ante best response to the uniform belief over the opponents' actions. If the ex-ante best-response action yields a constant payoff, sufficiently ambiguous-quality information induces a unique equilibrium, whereas sufficiently low-quality information generates multiple equilibria. In applications to financial crises, we demonstrate that news of more ambiguous quality triggers a debt rollover crisis, whereas news of less ambiguous quality triggers a currency crisis.",

    "translated_abstract": "在具有不完全和模糊信息的博弈中，理性行为不仅取决于基本模糊（关于状态的模糊性）而且取决于策略模糊（关于他人行为的模糊性）。我们研究了策略模糊在全球博弈中的影响。模糊质量信息使更多的玩家选择产生恒定收益的行动，而（明确的）低质量信息使更多的玩家选择对对手行动的统一信念做出前期最优反应。如果前期最优反应的行动产生恒定收益，则足够模糊的质量信息会诱导出一种唯一的均衡，而足够低质量的信息会产生多个均衡。在金融危机的应用中，我们证明了更模糊质量的新闻会引发债务展期危机，而质量较低的新闻会引发货币危机。",
