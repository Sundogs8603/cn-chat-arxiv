    "translated_abstract": "蒙特卡罗模拟在金融风险管理中被广泛使用，例如估算风险价值和定价场外衍生品。因为需要大量的情景以实现收敛，所以蒙特卡罗模拟需要高昂的计算成本。量子蒙特卡罗算法是一种有希望的替代方案：它们提供比传统算法更快的速度。最近的研究已经探索了常见风险测度的计算以及通过将输入量子状态初始化为预先计算的概率分布来优化QMC算法。本文着重于将情景生成纳入到量子计算中，通过模拟风险因素随时间的演变进行风险情景生成的量子电路组装。具体而言，我们组装了股权（几何布朗运动）、利率（均值回归模型）和信用（结构性和缩减形式信用模型）风险因素的随机模型的量子电路。然后将这些情景馈送到QMC模拟中，以估算金融资产组合的风险价值。我们的结果表明，与传统蒙特卡罗模拟相比，量子蒙特卡罗提供了一种准确且高效的估算风险价值的方法，速度提升高达800倍。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a quantum Monte Carlo simulation method for financial risk analysis, in which scenario generation is incorporated into quantum computation to simulate the evolution of risk factors over time, and the resulting scenarios are fed into QMC simulations to estimate the value-at-risk for a portfolio of financial assets. Compared to classical Monte Carlo simulations, the proposed method provides speed-up factors of up to 800."
