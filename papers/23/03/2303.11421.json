    "abstract": "Using deep learning methods to classify EEG signals can accurately identify people's emotions. However, existing studies have rarely considered the application of the information in another domain's representations to feature selection in the time-frequency domain. We propose a classification network of EEG signals based on the cross-domain feature fusion method, which makes the network more focused on the features most related to brain activities and thinking changes by using the multi-domain attention mechanism. In addition, we propose a two-step fusion method and apply these methods to the EEG emotion recognition network. Experimental results show that our proposed network, which combines multiple representations in the time-frequency domain and spatial domain, outperforms previous methods on public datasets and achieves state-of-the-art at present.",

    "translated_abstract": "使用深度学习方法对EEG信号进行分类可以准确识别人们的情绪。然而，现有研究很少考虑将另一个领域的表示中的信息应用于时频域的特征选择。我们提出了一种基于跨域特征融合方法的EEG信号分类网络，通过使用多域注意机制，使网络更专注于与脑活动和思维变化最相关的特征。此外，我们提出了一个两步融合方法，并将这些方法应用于EEG情感识别网络中。实验结果表明，我们提出的融合时频域和空间域的多重表示方法，优于先前公开数据集上的方法，在当前取得了最先进的结果。",
