    "translated_abstract": "咳嗽监测可以实现新的个体肺健康应用。主题咳嗽事件检测是连续咳嗽监测的基础。近年来，智能可穿戴设备的快速增长为这种需求开辟了新的机会。本文提出了EarCough，通过利用始终处于活动噪声抵消（ANC）模式下的麦克风，使Hearables上实现了连续主题咳嗽事件检测。具体而言，我们提出了一个轻量级的端到端神经网络模型-EarCoughNet。为了评估我们方法的有效性，我们通过用户研究构建了一个同步的运动和音频数据集。结果表明，EarCough在仅需要385 kB的空间要求下，实现了95.4％的准确度和92.9％的F1分数。我们预计EarCough将成为未来Hearables的低成本增值功能，实现连续主题咳嗽事件检测。",
