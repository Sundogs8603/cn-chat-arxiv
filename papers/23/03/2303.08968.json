    "abstract": "We present a parsimonious neural network approach, which does not rely on dynamic programming techniques, to solve dynamic portfolio optimization problems subject to multiple investment constraints. The number of parameters of the (potentially deep) neural network remains independent of the number of portfolio rebalancing events, and in contrast to, for example, reinforcement learning, the approach avoids the computation of high-dimensional conditional expectations. As a result, the approach remains practical even when considering large numbers of underlying assets, long investment time horizons or very frequent rebalancing events. We prove convergence of the numerical solution to the theoretical optimal solution of a large class of problems under fairly general conditions, and present ground truth analyses for a number of popular formulations, including mean-variance and mean-conditional value-at-risk problems. We also show that it is feasible to solve Sortino ratio-inspired objective",

    "translated_title": "一种简约神经网络方法解决组合优化问题而不使用动态规划",
    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种简约神经网络方法，该方法不依赖于动态规划技术，用于解决受多个投资约束限制的动态组合优化问题。神经网络（可能是深度的）的参数数量与组合再平衡事件的数量无关，与强化学习等方法相比，该方法避免了高维条件期望的计算。因此，在考虑大量基础资产、长期投资时间范围或非常频繁的再平衡事件时，该方法仍然是实用的。我们证明了数字解的收敛性，这些数字解是在相当普遍的条件下，解决了一大类问题的理论最优解，并为一些常见的公式，包括均值方差和均值条件风险值问题提供了真实的分析。我们还展示了解决Sortino比例启发式目标是可行的。",
