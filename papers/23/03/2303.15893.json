    "abstract": "We introduce VIVE3D, a novel approach that extends the capabilities of image-based 3D GANs to video editing and is able to represent the input video in an identity-preserving and temporally consistent way. We propose two new building blocks. First, we introduce a novel GAN inversion technique specifically tailored to 3D GANs by jointly embedding multiple frames and optimizing for the camera parameters. Second, besides traditional semantic face edits (e.g. for age and expression), we are the first to demonstrate edits that show novel views of the head enabled by the inherent properties of 3D GANs and our optical flow-guided compositing technique to combine the head with the background video. Our experiments demonstrate that VIVE3D generates high-fidelity face edits at consistent quality from a range of camera viewpoints which are composited with the original video in a temporally and spatially consistent manner.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了 VIVE3D，一种新颖的方法，将基于图像的 3D GAN 的能力扩展到视频编辑，并能以保留身份和时间一致性的方式呈现输入视频。我们提出了两个新的构建块。首先，我们针对 3D GAN 引入了一种新颖的 GAN 反演技术，通过联合嵌入多帧并优化相机参数。其次，除了传统的语义人脸编辑（例如年龄和表情），我们首次演示了基于 3D GAN 的内在属性和我们的光流引导的合成技术所启用的显示头部新视角的编辑。我们的实验表明，VIVE3D 以一致的质量从一系列摄像机视角生成高保真人脸编辑，与原始视频以一致的时间和空间方式组合。",
