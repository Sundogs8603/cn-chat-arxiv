    "translated_abstract": "在定义收益养老金计划的积累阶段，个人的最优投资策略已在文献中得到广泛研究。其中大多数采用了经典的反向模型和方法，但在养老金计划长期时程中，往往不会预先确定退休时间、偏好和市场环境模型。为了确保从反向模型和方法推导出的最优投资策略的时间一致性，预先承诺会导致所谓的最优策略在实际实现中不是最优的。本文通过前向偏好重新审视了定义收益养老金计划中积累阶段中工作者的最优投资问题，并解决了反向模型和方法中预先确定问题。文中阐述了工作者前向偏好的随机偏微分方程表示。本文构建了两个前向效用偏好模型：指数前向效用模型和双曲线前向效用模型。分别为这两种模型推导了最大化前向期望效用的最优投资策略。提供了数值实例，表明前向模型下的最优投资策略与经典反向模型和方法下的最优策略具有不同的特点。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper discusses the optimal investment problem for the worker in the defined contribution pension scheme under forward utility preferences, proposes two forward utility preference models, and derives optimal investment strategies for different models. Numerical illustrations show that the optimal investment strategies under the forward models have different features compared to those under the classical backward model and approach."
