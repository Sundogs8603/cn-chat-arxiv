    "translated_abstract": "自主移动机器人需要低功耗/高效能的机器学习算法来完成基于机器学习的任务，并能够适应多样化的环境，因为移动机器人通常由电池供电。脉冲神经网络（SNNs）可以实现这些要求，因为它们通过稀疏计算和具有生物启发式学习机制的高效在线学习，提供低功耗/高效能的处理。最近的研究表明，通过减少每个神经元处理一个脉冲序列（时间步长）的计算时间，可以优化SNNs的能量消耗。然而，现有技术依赖于大量的设计搜索来确定只能进行推断的固定时间步长设置，从而阻碍了SNNs在训练和推断阶段实现进一步的能量效率提高。这些技术还限制了SNNs在运行时进行高效的在线学习。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了TopSpark方法",
