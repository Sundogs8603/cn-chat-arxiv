    "abstract": "In recent years, European regulators have debated restricting the time an online tracker can track a user to protect consumer privacy better. Despite the significance of these debates, there has been a noticeable absence of any comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. This article fills this gap on the cost side by suggesting an approach to estimate the economic consequences of lifetime restrictions on cookies for publishers. The empirical study on cookies of 54,127 users who received 128 million ad impressions over 2.5 years yields an average cookie lifetime of 279 days, with an average value of EUR 2.52 per cookie. Only 13% of all cookies increase their daily value over time, but their average value is about four times larger than the average value of all cookies. Restricting cookies lifetime to one year (two years) decreases their lifetime value by 25% (19%), which represents a decrease in the value of all cookies of 9% (5%). In light of the EUR 10.60 billion cookie-based display ad rev",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，欧洲监管机构一直在就限制在线追踪用户的时间以更好地保护消费者隐私问题展开辩论。尽管这些辩论具有重要意义，但显然缺乏任何综合的成本效益分析。本文从成本方面提出了一种方法，旨在估计限制Cookie寿命对出版商的经济影响。对在2.5年内收到1.28亿广告展示的54,127个用户的Cookie进行的实证研究得出了平均Cookie寿命为279天，平均价值为2.52欧元/个。只有13%的cookie会随时间增值，但它们的平均价值约为所有cookie平均价值的四倍。将Cookie寿命限制在一年（两年）会使其寿命价值降低25％（19％），这表示所有Cookie价值减少了9％（5％）。鉴于106亿欧元的基于Cookie的展示广告收入，Cookie限制可能对出版商产生显着的经济影响。",
