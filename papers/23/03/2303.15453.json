    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for training an agent to actively request help in object-goal navigation tasks, with feedback indicating the location of the target object in its field of view. To make the agent more robust in scenarios where a teacher may not always be available, the proposed training curriculum includes a mix of episodes with and without feedback. The results show that this approach improves the agent's performance, even in the absence of feedback.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个框架，用于训练在目标-物体导航任务中主动请求帮助的代理，并使用反馈指示目标物体在其视野中的位置。为了使代理更具有稳健性，即在老师可能不总是可用的情况下，所提出的训练课程包括有和没有反馈的混合剧集。结果表明，这种方法提高了代理的性能，即使在没有反馈的情况下也是如此。",
