    "translated_abstract": "基于进化多目标（EMO）的网络剪枝算法可以平衡网络的剪枝率和性能。然而，由于基于种群的特性，它经常受到复杂的剪枝优化空间和高度资源消耗的剪枝结构验证过程的限制，从而限制了它的应用。为此，本文提出了一种基于多子网络的EMO联合剪枝（EMO-PMS），以减少空间复杂度和资源消耗。首先，提出了一种分治的EMO网络剪枝框架，将整个网络上复杂的EMO剪枝任务分解为多个子网络上更简单的子任务。一方面，这种分解减少了剪枝优化空间并降低了优化难度；另一方面，较小的网络结构收敛更快，因此所提出的算法的计算资源消耗较低。其次，基于跨网络约束的子网络训练方法。",
