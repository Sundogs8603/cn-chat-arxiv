    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能系统中鲁棒性问题日益突出，需要开发可靠的统计学习技术，即使在部分受损数据的情况下也能确保可靠性。偏好数据以 (完整) 排序的形式出现时也不例外，尤其是饱受此类数据支持或产生的技术(例如，搜索引擎，推荐系统)大规模部署之时，需要相应的概念和工具。然而，由于排列的集合 (即对称群 $\\mathfrak{S}_n$) 没有向量空间结构，且排序数据分析中考虑的统计量的复杂性，使得在该领域中制定鲁棒性目标具有挑战性。在本文中，我们引入了鲁棒性概念以及专用的统计方法，针对排名数据分析中的旗舰问题：Consensus Ranking，旨在通过中位数排名来总结排列的概率分布。",
