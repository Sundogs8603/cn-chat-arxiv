    "translated_abstract": "对话式语言模型的快速发展已取得了在复杂任务解决方面的显著进展。然而，它们的成功在很大程度上依赖于人类的指导，以引导对话，这可能是具有挑战性和耗时的。本文探讨了构建可扩展技术以促进交互式代理之间的自主合作并深入了解它们的“认知”过程的潜力。为了解决实现自主合作的挑战，我们提出了一个名为角色扮演的新型交互式代理框架。我们的方法涉及使用启动提示来引导聊天代理完成任务，同时保持与人类意图的一致性。我们展示了如何使用角色扮演来生成对话数据，以研究聊天代理的行为和能力，为研究对话式语言模型提供了有价值的资源。我们的贡献是介绍了一种新型的交互式代理框架，名为角色扮演，用于实现语言模型之间的自主合作，并展示了其在生成对话数据方面的有效性。",
