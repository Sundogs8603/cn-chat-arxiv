While various innovations have been developed to automate a range of educational tasks (e.g., question generation, feedback provision, and essay grading), there are concerns regarding the practicality and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research and the adoption of LLMs-based innovations in authentic educational contexts. To address this, we conducted a systematic literature review of 118 peer-reviewed papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational tasks.

    "translated_abstract": "基于大语言模型（LLMs）开发的教育技术创新显示出自动生成和分析文本内容的潜力。虽然已经开发了各种创新来自动化各种教育任务（例如，生成问题、提供反馈和评分），但对这些创新的实际性和伦理性存在担忧。这些担忧可能会阻碍未来研究和在真实教育环境中采用基于LLMs的创新。为了解决这个问题，我们对118篇自2017年以来发表的同行评议论文进行了系统的文献综述，以确定使用LLMs自动化和支持教育任务的当前研究状态。通过评估其技术可行性、模型性能、可复制性、系统透明度、隐私、平等和善意，还确定了LLMs创新的实际和伦理挑战。",
