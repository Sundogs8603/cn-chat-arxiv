    "translated_abstract": "支撑检测是一个具有广泛机器人应用的挑战性问题。传统的支撑检测方法局限于预定义的支撑标签，可能限制了智能机器人在复杂和动态环境中的适应性。在本文中，我们提出了开放词汇支撑检测（OpenAD）方法，能够在3D点云中检测无限数量的支撑。通过同时学习支撑文本和点特征，OpenAD成功地利用了支撑之间的语义关系。因此，我们提出的方法实现了零-shot检测，并能够在没有任何注释示例的情况下检测以前未见到的支撑。大量实验结果表明，OpenAD在各种支撑检测设置上有效，并且在性能上超过了其他基线方法。此外，我们还展示了OpenAD在实际中的实用性。",

By learning the affordance text and point features simultaneously, it exploits the semantic relationships between affordances, enabling zero-shot detection and the detection of previously unseen affordances without annotation examples. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of OpenAD in various setups."
