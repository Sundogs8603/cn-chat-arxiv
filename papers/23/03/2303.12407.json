    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了Langevin型算法应用于吉布斯分布的情况，其中势函数是耗散的，且其弱梯度具有有限的连续性模量。我们的主要结果是2-Wasserstein距离上限的非渐进性，它衡量了吉布斯分布与基于Liptser-Shiryaev理论和函数不等式的Langevin型算法的一般分布之间的距离。我们应用这个上限来展示势函数的耗散性以及梯度 $\\alpha>1/3$ 下的 $\\alpha$-H\\\"{o}lder连续性是充分的，可以通过适当控制参数来获得Langevin Monte Carlo算法的收敛性。我们还针对无凸性或连续可微性的势函数提出了球形平滑技术的Langevin型算法。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种新的Langevin型算法并应用于吉布斯分布。通过提出的2-Wasserstein距离上限，我们发现势函数的耗散性以及梯度 $\\alpha>1/3$ 下的 $\\alpha$-H\\\"{o}lder连续性可以保证算法具有接近零的误差。新的Langevin型算法还可以应用于无凸性或连续可微性的势函数。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new Langevin-type algorithm applied to Gibbs distribution, where the dissipativity of the potential and $\\alpha$-H\\\"{o}lder continuity of gradient with $\\alpha>1/3$ ensure the convergence of the algorithm with close to zero error. A non-asymptotic upper bound on the 2-Wasserstein distance is presented, and the proposed algorithm can also be applied to potentials without convexity or continuous differentiability."
