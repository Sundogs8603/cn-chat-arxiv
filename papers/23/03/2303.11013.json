    "abstract": "The optimal portfolio size for a venture capital (VC) fund is a topic often debated, but there is no consensus on the best strategy. This is because it is a function of many factors. It is not easy to find a general formula that can be applied to all situations, and it largely depends on the goal of the fund. In this report, we will go through the different factors step by step, studying how they affect fund returns and the optimal portfolio size, starting with some basic assumptions and then increasing the complexity of the model.",
