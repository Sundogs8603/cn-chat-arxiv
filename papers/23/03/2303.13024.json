    "translated_abstract": "对于具有缺失值的多元时间序列数据确定临床相关的生理状态非常重要，这对于提供急性疾病（如颅脑损伤、呼吸衰竭和心力衰竭）的适当治疗至关重要。利用非时间序列聚类或数据插值和聚合技术可能导致有价值信息的丢失和偏见分析。在本研究中，我们应用了基于自监督的SLAC-Time算法，避免了插值或聚合，从而更有效地表示急性患者状态。通过使用SLAC-Time来聚类大型研究数据集中的数据，我们确定了三种不同的TBI生理状态及其具体特征。我们采用了各种聚类评估指标，并结合临床领域专家的意见来验证和解释所识别的生理状态。此外，我们发现了特定临床事件和生理状态之间的关系。",
