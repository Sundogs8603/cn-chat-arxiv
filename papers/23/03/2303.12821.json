This paper presents DeepBlocks, a visual programming tool that allows DL developers to design, train, and evaluate models without relying on specific programming languages. DeepBlocks works by building on the typical model structure: a sequence of learnable functions whose arrangement defines the specific characteristics of the model. We derived DeepBlocks' design goals from a 5-participants formative interview, and we validated the first implementation of the tool through a typical use case. Results are promising and show that developers could visually design complex DL architectures.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习（DL）开发人员来自不同的背景，例如医学、基因组学、金融和计算机科学。为了创建DL模型，他们必须学习和使用高级编程语言（例如Python），因此需要处理相关设置和解决编程错误。本文介绍了DeepBlocks，这是一款可视化编程工具，允许DL开发人员设计、训练和评估模型，而无需依赖特定的编程语言。DeepBlocks通过构建典型模型结构实现其工作原理：一系列可学习函数的顺序排列定义了模型的特定特征。我们通过对5个参与者的形式化访谈推导出了DeepBlocks的设计目标，并通过一个典型用例验证了该工具的第一个实现。结果是令人兴奋的，表明开发人员可以视觉上设计复杂的DL架构。",
