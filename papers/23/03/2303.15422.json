    "translated_abstract": "尽管关键词提取和生成方法取得了显著的进展，但现行评估方法仅依赖于与人工参考的完全匹配，而忽略了无参考属性。这种方式无法识别生成与参考语义等效或具有实际效用的多样化关键词的系统。为了更好地评估关键词系统的能力，我们提出了一个全面的评估框架KPEval，包含四个关键维度：显著性、忠实性、多样性和实用性。对于每个维度，我们设计了与评估目标相一致的基于语义的度量指标。元评估研究表明，与之前使用的一系列度量指标相比，我们的评估策略更好地与人类偏好相关。使用这个框架，我们重新评估了20个关键词系统，并进一步发现：(1)最好的模型根据评估维度不同而不同；(2)实用性是关键词系统的一个重要方面。",

By introducing four critical dimensions, including saliency, faithfulness, diversity, and utility, and designing corresponding semantic-based metrics, KPEval performs better in terms of correlating with human preferences. The framework was used to re-evaluate 20 keyphrase systems, and it was discovered that the choice of the best model depends on the evaluation dimension, with utility being an important factor."
