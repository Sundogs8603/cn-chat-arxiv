    "translated_abstract": "卫星遥感图像分析在远程感知中起着至关重要的作用，但由云层引起的信息丢失严重阻碍了其应用。本研究提出了一种名为“渐进式多尺度注意力自编码器”（PMAA）的高性能云去除架构，同时利用全局和局部信息。其主要包括云检测和云去除模块。云检测通过云掩模加强云区域以促进云去除。云去除模块主要包括新颖的多尺度注意力模块（MAM）和局部交互模块（LIM）。PMAA通过MAM建立多尺度特征的长程依赖性，并通过LIM调节细粒度细节的重建，从而实现在同一级别上同时呈现细粒度和粗粒度特征。在各种数据集上，借助不同和多尺度特征表示的帮助下，PMAA在定量和视觉评估方面均优于先前的现有方法，展示了其高效性和鲁棒性。",
