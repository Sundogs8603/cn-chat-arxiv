    "translated_abstract": "针对常见的赢家通吃机制中存在的激励问题，最近的预测竞赛研究从Witkowski等人[2022]开始。Frongillo等人[2021]提出了一种基于follow-the-regularized-leader(FTRL)的竞赛机制，这是一种在线学习框架。他们证明他们的机制仅使用$O(\\log(n)/\\epsilon^2)$个事件就能高概率选择一个$\\epsilon$-最优的预测者。这些工作以及之前针对这个问题的所有工作都假设事件是独立的。我们开始研究带有相关事件的预测竞赛。为了量化相关性，我们引入了一个块相关的概念，它允许每个事件与最多$b$个事件强相关。我们证明，在具有这种相关性的分布下，FTRL机制仍然使用$O(b^2 \\log(n)/\\epsilon^2)$个事件保留了它的$\\epsilon$-最优保证。我们的证明涉及到一种新的相关随机变量浓度界，这可能是重要的。",
