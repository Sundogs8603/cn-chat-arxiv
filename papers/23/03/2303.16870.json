    "abstract": "We present an overview of the complex systems field using ChatGPT as a representation of the community's understanding. ChatGPT has learned language patterns and styles from a large dataset of internet texts, allowing it to provide answers that reflect common opinions, ideas, and language patterns found in the community. Our exploration covers both teaching and learning, and research topics. We recognize the value of ChatGPT as a source for the community's ideas.",
