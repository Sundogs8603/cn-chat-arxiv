    "translated_abstract": "生物医学实体链接（EL）包括命名实体识别（NER）和命名实体消歧（NED）。EL模型在由预定义的知识库标记的语料库上进行训练。然而，常见的情况是只有知识库的子集中的实体对利益相关者有价值。我们称这种情况为部分知识库推理：使用一个知识库对EL模型进行训练，并在没有进一步训练的情况下对其部分进行推理。在这项工作中，我们给出了这种实际上非常有价值但明显不够研究的情况的详细定义和评估方法，并评估了三个代表性的EL范例的方法。我们构建了部分知识库推理基准，并发现由于大量精度下降导致EL性能出现灾难性下降。我们的发现揭示了这些EL范例无法正确处理无法链接的提及（NIL），因此它们对部分知识库推理不具有鲁棒性。我们还提出了两种简单有效的赎回方法来解决NIL问题。",
