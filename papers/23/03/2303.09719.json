    "translated_abstract": "针对神经对话模型需要大量数据进行训练的问题，本文提出了数据增强技术，以有效利用现有的训练样本。然而，当前在对话生成任务中的数据增强技术大多数是对训练数据集中的所有案例进行增强，而没有考虑不同案例之间的内在属性。我们认为，并非所有案例都适合增强任务，适合增强的案例应该遵循以下两个属性：（1）低质量（对话模型无法为此案例生成高质量的响应），（2）典型性（案例应该代表整个数据集的特性）。 因此，我们提出了一种有选择数据增强框架（SDA）来探讨这个想法，SDA使用双重对抗网络在一个阶段中选择最低质量和最具代表性的数据点进行增强。在两个公开数据集上进行的大量实验证明了所提出的SDA框架可以通过选择性增强低质量和具有代表性的案例来大大提高响应生成任务的性能。",
