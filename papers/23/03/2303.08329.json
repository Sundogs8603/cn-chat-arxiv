    "abstract": "In recent years, emotional text-to-speech has shown considerable progress. However, it requires a large amount of labeled data, which is not easily accessible. Even if it is possible to acquire an emotional speech dataset, there is still a limitation in controlling emotion intensity. In this work, we propose a novel method for cross-speaker emotion transfer and manipulation using vector arithmetic in latent style space. By leveraging only a few labeled samples, we generate emotional speech from reading-style speech without losing the speaker identity. Furthermore, emotion strength is readily controllable using a scalar value, providing an intuitive way for users to manipulate speech. Experimental results show the proposed method affords superior performance in terms of expressiveness, naturalness, and controllability, preserving speaker identity.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，情绪文本转语音已经取得了相当大的进展，但仍需要大量标记数据，这并不容易获取。即使有可能获得情感语音数据集，仍然存在控制情感强度的限制。本文提出了一种新方法，通过操纵潜在的语音风格空间中的向量算术，实现跨说话人情感转移和操纵。利用少量标记样本，可以从阅读风格的语音生成情感语音，同时保留说话人身份。此外，情感强度可以通过标量值进行可控，为用户提供了一种直观的操作语音的方式。实验结果表明，所提出的方法在表现力、自然度和可控性方面都有着优越的性能，保留说话人身份。",
