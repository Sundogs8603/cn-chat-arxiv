    "abstract": "We study a model in which two players with opposing interests try to alter a status quo through instability-generating actions. We show that instability can be used to secure longer-term durable changes, even if it is costly to generate and does not generate short-term gains. In equilibrium, instability generated by a player decreases when the status quo favors them more. Equilibrium always exhibits a region of stable states in which the status quo persists. As players' threat power increases, this region shrinks, ultimately collapsing to a single stable state that is supported via a deterrence mechanism. There is long-run path-dependency and inequity: although instability eventually leads to a stable state, it typically selects the least favorable one for the initially disadvantaged player.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个模型，其中两个具有对立利益的玩家通过产生不稳定性来改变现状。我们表明，即使产生不稳定性是昂贵的且不会带来短期收益，但它可以用于确保更长期的持久性变化。在均衡状态下，由玩家产生的不稳定性会在现状更有利于他们时减少。均衡状态总是表现出一个稳定状态区域，其中现状持续存在。随着玩家威胁能力的增加，这个区域会缩小，最终通过威慑机制支持一个单一的稳定状态。存在长期的路径依赖性和不公平性：尽管不稳定性最终会导致一个稳定状态，但它通常会选择最不利于最初处于劣势的玩家的状态。",
