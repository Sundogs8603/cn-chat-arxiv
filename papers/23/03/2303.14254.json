    "translated_abstract": "时间序列数据的增强技术缓解了深度学习模型的训练数据不足问题。然而，现有的增强方法主要针对分类问题设计，即使增强改变了时间动态，类别标签也可以保持不变。我们注意到，针对预测设计的增强需要多样性和与原始时间动态的连贯性。由于实际物理过程产生的时间序列数据具有时域和频域的特征，因此我们提出了组合频谱和时间增强（STAug）来生成更多样化和连贯的样本。具体而言，在频域中，我们使用经验模态分解来分解时间序列，并使用随机权重重新组装子分量。这样，我们可以生成多样的样本，同时与原始时间序列的关系连贯一致，因为它们都包含相同的基础分量。在时间域中，我们采用混合策略来组合数据，这可以增强模型对样本之间的连贯性。",
