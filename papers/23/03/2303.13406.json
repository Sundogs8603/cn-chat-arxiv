    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种简单的工具，用于在存在许多检验、检验统计量相关且信号潜在稀疏的情况下控制错误发现并识别单个信号。该工具在一系列不断扩展的$p$值子集上递归应用柯西组合检验，并称为顺序柯西组合检验。虽然原始的柯西组合检验旨在通过对转换后的$p$值求和对一组零假设进行全局声明，但顺序版本确定哪些$p$值触发拒绝全局零假设。该检验实现了强大的家族误差率控制，并且当检验统计量依赖于现有的控制程序时，比现有的控制程序保守程度更低，从而导致更高的全局功率和成功的检测率。作为说明，我们考虑了两种流行的金融计量应用程序，两者的检验统计量具有序列依赖性或横截面依赖性：监测漂移。",
