    "abstract": "Collective motion is an ubiquitous phenomenon in nature, inspiring engineers, physicists and mathematicians to develop mathematical models and bio-inspired designs. Collective motion at small to medium group sizes ($\\sim$10-1000 individuals, also called the `mesoscale'), can show nontrivial features due to stochasticity. Therefore, characterizing both the deterministic and stochastic aspects of the dynamics is crucial in the study of mesoscale collective phenomena. Here, we use a physics-inspired, neural-network based approach to characterize the stochastic group dynamics of interacting individuals, through a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that governs the collective dynamics of the group. We apply this technique on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and identify the deterministic and stochastic aspects of the dynamics using drift and diffusion fields, enabling us to make novel inferences about the nature of order in these systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "集体运动是自然界中普遍存在的现象，启发工程师、物理学家和数学家开发数学模型和生物启发设计。小至中等群体规模（约10-1000个个体，也称“介观尺度”的集体运动，由于随机性而显示出非平凡的特征。因此，在介观尺度集体现象的研究中，表征确定性和随机动力学方面的特征是至关重要的。我们基于物理启发，采用基于神经网络的方法来表征相互作用个体的随机群体动力学，通过控制群体的随机微分方程（SDE）来研究这些系统的群体动力学。我们在合成和真实数据集上应用这种技术，利用漂移和扩散场鉴定系统的确定性和随机性方面的动力学，从而使我们能够针对这些系统的秩序性质做出新颖的推断。",
