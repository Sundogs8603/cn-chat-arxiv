    "translated_abstract": "最近等变图神经网络（GNN）的进展使深度学习能够开发快速的模型替代昂贵的从头计算量子力学（QM）方法，以用于分子势能的预测。然而，使用GNN建立准确和可迁移的势能模型仍然具有挑战性，因为数据受到昂贵的计算成本和QM方法的理论层次的限制，特别是对于大型和复杂的分子系统。在这项工作中，我们提出了对非平衡分子构型进行去噪预训练，以实现更准确和可迁移的GNN势能预测。具体地，对采样的非平衡构型的原子坐标进行随机噪声扰动，并预训练GNN对扰动的分子构型进行去噪，从而恢复原始坐标。对多个基准测试进行严格实验证明，预训练显著提高了神经势能的准确性。此外，我们还展示了预训练可以提高可迁移性，使模型在不同系统上表现良好。",
