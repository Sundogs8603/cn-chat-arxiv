    "abstract": "We address the problem of efficiently computing Shap explanation scores for classifications with machine learning models. With this goal, we show the transformation of binary neural networks (BNNs) for classification into deterministic and decomposable Boolean circuits, for which knowledge compilation techniques are used. The resulting circuit is treated as an open-box model, to compute Shap scores by means of a recent efficient algorithm for this class of circuits. Detailed experiments show a considerable gain in performance in comparison with computing Shap directly on the BNN treated as a black-box model.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了使用机器学习模型进行分类的Shap解释分数的高效计算问题。为此，我们展示了将二进制神经网络（BNN）转换为确定性和可分解的布尔电路，使用知识编译技术。所得到的电路被视为开放式模型，通过最近的高效算法计算Shap分数。详细的实验表明，与将BNN视为黑盒模型直接计算Shap相比，性能有了显著的提高。",
