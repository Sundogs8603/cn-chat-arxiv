    "translated_abstract": "过去十年，利用唯一标识（ID）来表示不同用户和物品的推荐模型一直是最先进的，并且在推荐系统文献中占主导地位。与此同时，预训练模态编码器（如BERT和ViT）在对物品的原始模态特征（如文本和图像）进行建模方面变得越来越强大。因此，自然而然的问题是：通过用最先进的模态编码器替换物品ID嵌入向量，一个纯粹的基于模态的推荐模型（MoRec）能否胜过或与纯ID基础模型（IDRec）相匹配？实际上，早在十年前，这个问题就被回答了，IDRec在推荐准确性和效率方面都远远胜过MoRec。我们旨在重新审视这个“老问题”，从多个方面对MoRec进行系统研究。具体而言，我们研究了几个子问题：（i）在实际场景中，MoRec或IDRec哪个推荐模式表现更好，特别是在一般情况和......",
