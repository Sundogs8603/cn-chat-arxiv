Conceptually, we provide a distinct definition for natural language reasoning in NLP, based on both philosophy and NLP scenarios, discuss what types of tasks require reasoning, and introduce a taxonomy of reasoning. Practically, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on natural language reasoning in NLP, mainly covering classical logical reasoning, natural language inference, multi-hop question answering, and commonsense reasoning. The paper also identifies and views backward reasoning, a powerful paradigm for multi-step reasoning, and introduces defeasible reasoning as one of the most important future directions in natural language reasoning research. We focus on single-modality unstructured natural language text, excluding neuro-symbolic techniques and mathematical reasoning.",

    "translated_abstract": "本综述论文提出了自然语言处理领域中自然语言推理概念的更为清晰的视角，旨在从概念和实践两个方面探讨自然语言推理。在概念方面，本文根据哲学和NLP场景提供了自然语言推理在NLP中的明确定义，讨论了哪些类型的任务需要推理，并介绍了一种推理分类法。在实践方面，本文对NLP中的自然语言推理进行了全面的文献综述，主要涵盖了经典逻辑推理、自然语言推理、多跳问题回答和常识推理。本文还将强大的多步推理模式——反向推理等视为未来自然语言推理研究的重要方向，并将可撤销推理介绍为其中最重要的未来方向之一。本文关注单模态非结构化自然语言文本，不包括神经符号技术和数学推理。",
