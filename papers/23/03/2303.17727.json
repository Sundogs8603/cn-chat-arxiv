    "translated_abstract": "有效地在普通CPU硬件上进行大规模神经网络的训练和推理对于民主化深度学习能力具有巨大的实际意义。目前，由数十亿个参数组成的大规模模型的训练过程需要广泛使用专用硬件加速器（例如GPU），这些加速器仅限于少数具有相当财务资源的机构。此外，训练和部署这些模型通常会带来惊人的碳足迹。在本文中，我们通过引入BOLT，一种用于在标准CPU硬件上训练大型神经网络模型的稀疏深度学习库来解决这些挑战。BOLT提供了一个灵活的高级API，用于构建模型，该API对于现有流行的深度学习框架的用户来说是熟悉的。通过自动调整专用超参数，BOLT也抽象掉了稀疏网络训练的算法细节。",
