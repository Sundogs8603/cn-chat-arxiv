    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络缺乏可解释性且往往过于自信，这在安全关键应用（如自动驾驶、医疗成像或对可靠性要求较高的机器视觉任务）中会带来严重问题。量化预测的不确定性是开发深度神经网络用于此类应用的一种有前途的方法，但当前可用方法计算负担较大。本文提出一种名为 Deep Uncertainty Distillation using Ensembles （DUDES）的新方法，用于高效可靠地估算不确定性。DUDES 使用深度集成的知识蒸馏，在保持简单易用的同时，通过单个向前传递准确地近似预测不确定性。实验结果表明，DUDES 在不牺牲分割任务的性能的前提下准确地捕获了预测的不确定性，并表现出识别错误分类实例和检测到分布之外样本的出色能力",
