    "abstract": "Current research on the advantages and trade-offs of using characters, instead of tokenized text, as input for deep learning models, has evolved substantially. New token-free models remove the traditional tokenization step; however, their efficiency remains unclear. Moreover, the effect of tokenization is relatively unexplored in sequence tagging tasks. To this end, we investigate the impact of tokenization when extracting information from documents and present a comparative study and analysis of subword-based and character-based models. Specifically, we study Information Extraction (IE) from biomedical texts. The main outcome is twofold: tokenization patterns can introduce inductive bias that results in state-of-the-art performance, and the character-based models produce promising results; thus, transitioning to token-free IE models is feasible.",

    "translated_abstract": "目前，使用字符而不是分词文本作为深度学习模型输入的优势和权衡的研究已经得到了很大的发展。新的无分词模型消除了传统的分词步骤，但它们的效率仍不清楚。此外，在序列标记任务中，分词的影响相对未被探索。为此，我们调查了从文档中提取信息时分词的影响，并对基于子词和基于字符的模型进行了比较研究和分析。具体而言，我们研究了从生物医学文本中进行信息抽取 (IE)。主要结果是双重的：分词模式可能会引入归纳偏差，从而产生最先进的性能。基于字符的模型产生有希望的结果，因此，转换为无分词的IE模型是可行的。",
