    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable results in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks with in-context learning, which involves inference based on a few demonstration examples. Despite their successes in NLP tasks, no investigation has been conducted to assess the ability of LLMs to perform document information extraction (DIE) using in-context learning. Applying LLMs to DIE poses two challenges: the modality and task gap. To this end, we propose a simple but effective in-context learning framework called ICL-D3IE, which enables LLMs to perform DIE with different types of demonstration examples. Specifically, we extract the most difficult and distinct segments from hard training documents as hard demonstrations for benefiting all test instances. We design demonstrations describing relationships that enable LLMs to understand positional relationships. We introduce formatting demonstrations for easy answer extraction. Additionally",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）如GPT-3和ChatGPT在各种自然语言处理（NLP）任务中展示了卓越的成果，尤其是应用于上下文学习，即基于少量演示示例进行推理。尽管在NLP任务中取得了成功，但尚未进行研究以评估LLM在使用上下文学习执行文档信息抽取（DIE）的能力。应用LLM执行DIE存在两个挑战：模态和任务差距。为此，我们提出了一种简单而有效的上下文学习框架ICL-D3IE，它使LLM能够使用不同类型的演示示例执行DIE。具体而言，我们从难以训练的文档中提取最困难和最不同的片段作为演示示例，以便受益于所有测试实例。我们设计了描述关系的演示示例，使LLM能够理解位置关系。我们引入了格式化演示示例，以方便提取答案。此外，我们采用了反馈机制，更新了演示示例，以进一步提高ICL-D3IE的性能。",
