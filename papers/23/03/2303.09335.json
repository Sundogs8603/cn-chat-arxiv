    "translated_abstract": "利用径向速度法检测系外行星的方法在于探测由未知下部恒星伴星引起的恒星速度变化。仪器误差、不规则时间采样以及源自于恒星内在变异的不同噪声源可能会阻碍数据的解释，甚至导致虚假探测结果。近期，在系外行星领域出现了使用机器学习算法的研究，其中一些结果甚至超过了传统技术的结果。本研究旨在探索神经网络在径向速度法中的应用范围，特别是在存在与星体相关的噪声的情况下进行系外行星探测。提出了一种神经网络算法，以代替径向速度法检测到的信号的重要性计算并将其分类为行星还是非行星来源。该算法使用已知有行星系统的合成数据进行训练，然后在未知有行星系统的合成和真实数据上进行测试。ExoplANNET算法展现出有前途的结果，并表明深度学习算法可以在系外行星的鉴定和表征中发挥重要作用。",
