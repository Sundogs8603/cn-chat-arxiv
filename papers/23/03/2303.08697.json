    "abstract": "We present Mirror, an open-source platform for data exploration and analysis powered by large language models. Mirror offers an intuitive natural language interface for querying databases, and automatically generates executable SQL commands to retrieve relevant data and summarize it in natural language. In addition, users can preview and manually edit the generated SQL commands to ensure the accuracy of their queries. Mirror also generates visualizations to facilitate understanding of the data. Designed with flexibility and human input in mind, Mirror is suitable for both experienced data analysts and non-technical professionals looking to gain insights from their data.",
