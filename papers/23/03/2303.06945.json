    "translated_abstract": "蛋白质相互作用在生化过程中起着重要作用。准确预测蛋白质相互作用位点（PPIs）可以加深我们对生物机理的理解，并对新药设计至关重要。然而，传统的PPI预测实验方法成本高昂，耗时长，因此近年来开发了许多计算方法，特别是基于机器学习的方法。尽管这些方法取得了令人满意的结果，但仍存在两个限制：（1）大多数模型挖掘了一些有用的输入特征，但未考虑到共进化特征，后者可以提供有关氨基酸残基之间的关系的线索；（2）attention-based模型仅为相邻残基分配关注权重，而不是全局分配，忽略了远离目标残基的一些残基可能也很重要。我们提出了一种共进化增强的全局关注神经网络，这是一种用于PPI位点预测的基于序列的深度学习模型。该模型结合了共进化特征和全局关注机制，以更好地捕捉氨基酸残基之间的关系，并考虑到蛋白序列中所有残基的贡献。",
