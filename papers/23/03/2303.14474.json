    "translated_abstract": "许多骨骼动作识别模型使用GCN通过连接的3D人体关节代表人体。GCNs聚合一到少量跳跃图邻域，并忽略未连接身体关节之间的依赖关系。我们提出形成超图来模拟图节点之间的超边（例如，第三和第四阶超边捕获三个和四个节点），这有助于捕获身体关节组的高阶运动模式。我们将动作序列分成时间块，Higher-order Transformer (HoT)基于（i）身体关节，（ii）身体关节的成对链接和（iii）骨架身体关节的高阶超边，产生每个时间块的嵌入。我们通过新型Multi-order Multi-mode Transformer(3Mformer)结合这些超级边的HoT嵌入，其中两个模块的顺序可以交换，以实现基于'channel-temporal block'，'order-channel-body joint'，'channel-hyper-edge-order'的耦合模式令牌上的耦合模式注意力。实验结果表明，3Mformer在三个基准数据集上优于现有最先进的模型。",
