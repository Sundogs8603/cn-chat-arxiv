    "abstract": "We study building a multi-task agent in Minecraft. Without human demonstrations, solving long-horizon tasks in this open-ended environment with reinforcement learning (RL) is extremely sample inefficient. To tackle the challenge, we decompose solving Minecraft tasks into learning basic skills and planning over the skills. We propose three types of fine-grained basic skills in Minecraft, and use RL with intrinsic rewards to accomplish basic skills with high success rates. For skill planning, we use Large Language Models to find the relationships between skills and build a skill graph in advance. When the agent is solving a task, our skill search algorithm walks on the skill graph and generates the proper skill plans for the agent. In experiments, our method accomplishes 24 diverse Minecraft tasks, where many tasks require sequentially executing for more than 10 skills. Our method outperforms baselines in most tasks by a large margin. The project's website and code can be found at https:",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文研究在 Minecraft 中构建一个多任务智能体。在没有人工演示的情况下，用强化学习（RL）解决这个开放式环境中的长程任务是极其样本低效的。为了解决这个问题，我们将 Minecraft 任务的解决分解成学习基本技能和基于技能进行规划两个阶段。我们在 Minecraft 中提出了三种类型的细粒度基本技能，并使用具有内在奖励的 RL 方法来实现成功率高的基本技能学习。在技能规划方面，我们使用大型语言模型来发现技能之间的关系，预先构建技能图。当智能体解决任务时，我们的技能搜索算法在技能图上行走并生成适当的技能计划。在实验中，我们的方法解决了 24 个不同的 Minecraft 任务，其中许多任务需要连续执行超过 10 个技能。我们的方法在大多数任务中优于基线算法。项目的网址和代码可以在 https://www.rocwang.me/plan4mc.html 找到。",
