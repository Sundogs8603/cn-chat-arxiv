    "abstract": "Survivors of sexual harassment frequently share their experiences on social media, revealing their feelings and emotions and seeking advice. We observed that on Reddit, survivors regularly share long posts that describe a combination of (i) a sexual harassment incident, (ii) its effect on the survivor, including their feelings and emotions, and (iii) the advice being sought.

    "translated_abstract": "受到性骚扰的幸存者经常在社交媒体上分享自己的经历，展示他们的感受和情绪，并寻求建议。我们发现，在 Reddit 上，幸存者经常分享描述以下三个内容的长帖文：（i）性骚扰事件、（ii）其对幸存者的影响，包括他们的感受和情绪，以及（iii）正在寻求的建议。我们称这样的帖文为 MeToo 帖文，尽管它们可能没有被标记，并且可能出现在各种子论坛中。我们提出了一个基于自然语言的模型来从长帖文中识别描述上述三种类别的句子，以便帮助人员理解幸存者的需求。在数据集的十折交叉验证中，我们的模型实现了 0.82 的宏 F1 评分。",
