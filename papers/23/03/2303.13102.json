    "translated_abstract": "现有的最优输运方法主要通过输运成本/距离最小化来推导最优的输运计划/匹配，但这种方法在某些情况下可能导致错误的匹配。在许多应用程序中，在域之间注释一些匹配的关键点是合理的，甚至是不费力的。因此，研究如何利用注释的关键点来指导OT中的正确匹配具有价值。本文提出了一种新型的基于关键点引导的最优输运模型，通过关键点引导寻找最优匹配（即输运计划）。为了在OT中使用关键点，首先，我们提出了一种基于掩模的输运计划约束，用于保留关键点成对的匹配关系。其次，我们提出了保留每个数据点与关键点的关系以指导匹配的方法。所提出的KPG-RL模型可以通过Sinkhorn的算法求解，并且在分布在不同空间上时也适用。",
