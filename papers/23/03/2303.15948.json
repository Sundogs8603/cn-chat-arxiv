In our formulation, depth can be estimated as a kernel hyper-parameter by optimizing the evidence lower bound. Further, we introduce sparseness in the eigenbasis by variational learning of the spherical harmonic phases.

    "translated_abstract": "我们重新审视了带有球谐特征的高斯过程模型，并研究了与其相关的RKHS、其特征值结构以及深度模型之间的联系。基于此，我们引入了一类新的核函数，它对应于具有连续深度的深度模型。在我们的公式中，深度可以通过优化证据下界来估计为核超参数。此外，我们通过变分学习球谐相位引入了本征基础的稀疏性。这使得我们可以处理比以前更大的输入维度，并且允许学习高频变化。我们在机器学习基准数据集上验证了我们的方法。",
