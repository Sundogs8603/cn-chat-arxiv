    "translated_abstract": "在遗传规划中，保持基因多样性以避免过早收敛是至关重要的。多种方法已被提出来实现这一点，其中一些方法集中于交配阶段，通过耦合不同的解决方案到一些形式的自适应选择机制来实现。在自然中，基因多样性可以是许多不同因素的结果，但当考虑繁殖时，性选择对于在一个物种内促进变异具有影响。具体来说，异性选择往往导致不同的选择压力，进而可能在它们之间引发进化差异。虽然一些性选择机制曾经被应用于遗传规划中，但当涉及到交配选择时，相关文献较少。最近，通过理想伴侣表示法建模交配偏好的方法被提出，与标准方法相比，取得了良好的结果。这些交配偏好按照自适应方式自由进化，并能产生多样化的种群，从而得到更好的结果。",
