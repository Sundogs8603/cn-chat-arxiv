    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们研究了一种称为模式推理的新型推理范式，它通过重建先前的深度神经网络(DNN)前向方案来学习演绎地推断可解释的预测，以模式的哲学认知概念为指导。我们致力于将传统的模型推理流程重新定义为一种图匹配策略，通过类比人类推理机制中的印象匹配，将图像的提取视觉概念与预先计算的场景印象相关联。为此，我们设计了一种精心构建的架构，称为SchemaNet，作为所提出的模式推理概念的专用实例，它将输入实例的视觉语义和目标类别的学习抽象想象都建模为拓扑关系图。同时，为了全局视图中捕捉和利用视觉语义的组合贡献，我们还在SchemaNet中引入了一个通用的Feat2Graph方案。",
