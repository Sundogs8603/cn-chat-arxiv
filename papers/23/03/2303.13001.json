Our evaluation is based on six benchmark datasets, and we adopt the prompt suggested by OpenAI while extending it to six candidate prompts. We find that ChatGPT performs exceptionally well on all six candidate prompts, with minor performance differences observed across the datasets.

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT的出现引起了计算语言学界的重视。为了展示其作为关键词生成器的能力，我们对ChatGPT进行了初步评估以用于关键词生成任务。我们评估了其在各个方面的性能，包括关键词生成提示，关键词生成多样性，多领域关键词生成和长文本理解。我们的评估基于六个基准数据集，并采用OpenAI建议的提示，并将其扩展为六个候选提示。我们发现ChatGPT在所有六个候选提示上表现出色，在不同数据集之间观察到了轻微的性能差异。基于我们的发现，我们得出结论，ChatGPT有很大的关键词生成潜力。此外，我们发现ChatGPT在生成缺失关键词方面仍面临挑战。最后，在最后一节中，我们还介绍了一些限制和未来的研究方向。",
