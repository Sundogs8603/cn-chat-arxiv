    "translated_abstract": "在量化市场中，由于市场动态快速变化和大量的不确定性，如何采取适当的行动利润仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。强化学习作为一种面向奖励的最优控制方法，在这种复杂的金融场景中已成为解决策略决策问题的有希望的方法。本文将两种先前的金融交易策略（恒定比例组合保险（CPPI）和时间不变组合保护（TIPP））集成到多智能体深度确定性策略梯度（MADDPG）中，并提出了两种特别设计的多智能体强化学习（MARL）方法：CPPI-MADDPG和TIPP-MADDPG研究量化市场中的战略交易。之后，我们选择了实际金融市场上的100种不同股票来测试这些特别提出的方法。实验结果表明，CPPI-MADDPG和TIPP-MADDPG方法通常优于传统方法。",
