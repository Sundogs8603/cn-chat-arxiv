    "translated_abstract": "触感信息在人类灵巧性中扮演着至关重要的角色，它可以提供有用的接触信息，直接从视觉中无法推断。这篇论文探讨了是否能够使多指机器人手具备与人类类似的不看就能旋转物体的能力。作者们提出了一个新的系统Touch Dexterity，通过使用覆盖整个机器人手的密集二进制力传感器（触摸或未触摸）代替仅仅在小区域内进行精准的触觉传感，使系统具有低成本、覆盖范围广等优点，并通过强化学习在多样的物体模拟中训练出了一种触感旋转策略，能够在真实的机器人手上直接实施不看就能旋转新型物体。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一种新系统Touch Dexterity，通过密集二进制力传感器实现了多指机器人手不看就能旋转物体，同时大大降低了成本和与实际应用的差距。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new system called Touch Dexterity that enables a multi-finger robot hand to perform in-hand object rotation without vision, using dense binary force sensors. The system achieves high success rates in rotation tasks with both smooth and ridged surfaces, and reduces cost and the Sim2Real gap."
