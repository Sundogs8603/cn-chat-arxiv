    "abstract": "Mordecai3 is a new end-to-end text geoparser and event geolocation system. The system performs toponym resolution using a new neural ranking model to resolve a place name extracted from a document to its entry in the Geonames gazetteer. It also performs event geocoding, the process of linking events reported in text with the place names where they are reported to occur, using an off-the-shelf question-answering model. The toponym resolution model is trained on a diverse set of existing training data, along with several thousand newly annotated examples. The paper describes the model, its training process, and performance comparisons with existing geoparsers. The system is available as an open source Python library, Mordecai 3, and replaces an earlier geoparser, Mordecai v2, one of the most widely used text geoparsers (Halterman 2017).",

    "translated_abstract": "Mordecai3 是一个新的端到端文本地理解析和事件地理编码系统。该系统使用新的神经排名模型对从文档中提取的地名进行地名解析，将其解析成Geonames地名词典中的条目。它还使用现成的问答模型执行事件地理编码，即将文本中报告的事件与它们发生的地方联系起来。地址解析模型在现有的多个训练数据集上进行了训练，同时还进行了几千个新的注释示例。本文描述了模型、它的训练过程和与现有地理解析器的性能比较。该系统以开源Python库Mordecai 3的形式提供，取代了先前地理解析器Mordecai v2成为最广泛使用的文本地理解析器之一(Halterman 2017)。",
