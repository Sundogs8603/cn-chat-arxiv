    "abstract": "Logical reasoning is central to human cognition and intelligence. Past research of logical reasoning within AI uses formal language as knowledge representation~(and symbolic reasoners). However, reasoning with formal language has proved challenging~(e.g., brittleness and knowledge-acquisition bottleneck). This paper provides a comprehensive overview on a new paradigm of logical reasoning, which uses natural language as knowledge representation~(and pretrained language models as reasoners), including philosophical definition and categorization of logical reasoning, advantages of the new paradigm, benchmarks and methods, challenges of the new paradigm, desirable tasks & methods in the future, and relation to related NLP fields. This new paradigm is promising since it not only alleviates many challenges of formal representation but also has advantages over end-to-end neural methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "逻辑推理是人类认知和智能的核心。以往的人工智能中的逻辑推理研究使用形式化语言作为知识表示（和符号推理器）。然而，使用形式化语言进行推理证明具有困难（例如脆弱性和知识获取瓶颈）。本文总结了一种新的逻辑推理方法的综合概述，它使用自然语言作为知识表示（以及预训练语言模型作为推理器），包括逻辑推理的哲学定义和分类，新模式的优势、基准和方法，未来需要的任务和方法以及与相关 NLP 领域的关系。这种新模式是很有前途的，因为它不仅可以缓解形式化表示的许多挑战，而且也具有优于端到端神经方法的优势。",
