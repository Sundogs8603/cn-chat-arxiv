    "translated_abstract": "随着信息传播和检索的快速发展，利用自动化手段预测股市价格变得至关重要。本文提出了 Taureau，一个利用 Twitter 情感分析预测股市走势的框架。我们旨在确定 Twitter 是否代表一般大众，能否揭示公众对特定公司的看法并与公司的股价走势存在任何相关性。我们旨在利用这种相关性来预测股价走势。我们首先利用 Tweepy 和 getOldTweets 获取一组顶级公司在重大事件期间代表公众观点的历史推文。我们使用标准程序库对推文进行过滤和标记。然后，我们从获得的推文中进行矢量化和词语嵌入生成。之后，我们利用 TextBlob，一个最先进的情感分析引擎，帮助分类推文的情感为积极、消极或中性情绪。然后我们使用这些情感分数以及其他特征训练监督机器学习模型来预测股市的走势。实验评估表明，我们的框架优于几个现有基线模型，在预测股市走势方面实现高达78%的准确性。",

    "en_tdlr": "Taureau is a framework that uses Twitter sentiment analysis to predict stock market movement. It leverages historical tweets for vectorization and word embedding generation, classifies sentiment using TextBlob, and employs supervised machine learning models for stock movement prediction. The framework outperforms established baselines, achieving up to 78% accuracy in predicting stock movement."
