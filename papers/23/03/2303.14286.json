    "translated_abstract": "随着医疗保健领域面临着人口老龄化、人手短缺和常见慢性病等重大挑战，向个体提供高质量的护理已变得非常困难。对话代理已被证明是缓解这些问题的一种有前途的技术。它们可以作为数字健康助手，潜在地改善老年人和慢性病患者的日常生活，包括服药提醒、例行检查或社交闲聊。此外，对话代理可以满足人们对日常新闻或本地活动信息的基本需求，使个人能够保持对周围世界的了解和联系。然而，对于那些可能技术素养有限或健康相关能力受限的人来说，寻找相关新闻来源和浏览网上大量的新闻文章可能会让他们感到不知所措。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种智能的辅助居住新闻搜索系统，它结合了基于语音的对话代理和知识图谱。该系统允许用户使用自然语言与新闻搜索系统交互，使他们更容易和更直观地找到所需信息。该系统还使用知识图谱为用户提供个性化和上下文相关的内容推荐。我们的初步评估表明，所提出的方法有潜力显著改善辅助居住环境中的老年人和慢性病患者的新闻搜索体验。",
