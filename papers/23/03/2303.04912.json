    "translated_abstract": "状态抽象是在机器人环境中进行规划的有效技术，该环境具有连续状态和动作、长任务时间和稀疏反馈。在面向对象的环境中，谓词是一种特别有用的状态抽象形式，因为其与符号规划器的兼容性以及其关系泛化的能力。然而，要使用谓词进行规划，代理必须能够在连续环境状态下解释它们（即接地符号）。手动编程谓词解释可能很困难，因此我们希望从数据中学习它们。我们提出了一种基于身体知识的主动学习范式，其中代理通过与专家进行在线交互来学习谓词解释。例如，在堆叠积木环境中采取行动后，代理可能会问专家：“On(block1，block2)是否为真？”从这个经验中，代理学习规划：学习神经谓词解释、符号规划算子和任务特定的关系状态抽象。我们的实验表明，这种方法可以学习有效的抽象，并在一系列机器人操作任务中改进基线的性能。",
