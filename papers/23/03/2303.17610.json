    "translated_abstract": "集合预报后处理是生成准确概率预报的必要步骤。传统的后处理方法是根据每个位置或每个提前期估计参数统计分布。我们提出了一种基于神经网络的新方法，它可以联合预测所有位置和提前期。为了放宽许多后处理方法的分布假设，我们的方法采用归一化流作为灵活的参数分布估计器。这使我们能够以数学确切的方式模拟不同的预测分布。我们在EUPPBench基准测试中展示了我们方法的有效性，在该测试中，我们对西欧地区子区域的站点进行了温度预报后处理。我们展示了我们的新方法在基准测试中表现出卓越的性能，超越了我们之前的表现良好的成绩。此外，通过提供详细的比较，我们证明了我们方法的优越性。",
