    "translated_abstract": "身体自我意识的核心是对自己身体拥有权的感知。最近，为了更深入地了解大脑对自身身体编码的机制，人们做出了各种尝试，发展出一个统一的理论框架来解释相关的行为和神经生理现象。一个核心问题是如何解释橡胶手幻觉这样的身体错觉实际发生的机制。尽管已经有了有关身体自我意识机制和可能相关的脑区的概念性描述，但现有的理论模型仍然缺乏解释大脑如何编码对自己身体的感知和如何使用神经网络生成我们主观感知的身体错觉的计算机制。在这里，我们整合身体自我意识的生物学发现，提出一个基于大脑启发的身体自我感知模型，使身体自我感知可以在没有外部刺激的情况下自主构建。基于该模型的模拟复制了橡胶手幻觉，并提供了对潜在神经机制的见解。",
