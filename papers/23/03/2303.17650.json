ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is a recent addition to the family of language models and is being called a disruptive technology by a few, owing to its human-like text-generation capabilities. Although, many anecdotal examples across the internet have evaluated ChatGPT's strength and weakness, only a few systematic research studies exist. To contribute to the body of literature of systematic research on ChatGPT, we evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on Abstractive Summarization by the means of automated metrics and blinded human reviewers. We also build automatic text classifiers to detect ChatGPT generated summaries. We found that while text classification algorithms can distinguish between real and generated summaries, humans are unable to distinguish between real summaries and those produced by ChatGPT.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）因其在各种任务上的出色表现而受到广泛关注。OpenAI开发的ChatGPT是语言模型家族的最新成员，由于其类人的文本生成能力，被一些人称为一项颠覆性技术。尽管网络上有许多ChatGPT的例子来评估其强弱之处，但只有少数系统性的研究存在。为了为ChatGPT的系统性研究做出贡献，我们通过自动化指标和盲审人员评估了ChatGPT在抽象概括方面的表现。我们还构建了自动文本分类器来检测ChatGPT生成的摘要。我们发现，虽然文本分类算法可以区分真实和生成的摘要，但人类无法区分真实摘要和ChatGPT生成的摘要。",

Text classification algorithms, however, can distinguish between them."
