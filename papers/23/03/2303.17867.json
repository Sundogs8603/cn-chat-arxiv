    "abstract": "Content affinity loss including feature and pixel affinity is a main problem which leads to artifacts in photorealistic and video style transfer. This paper proposes a new framework named CAP-VSTNet, which consists of a new reversible residual network and an unbiased linear transform module, for versatile style transfer. This reversible residual network can not only preserve content affinity but not introduce redundant information as traditional reversible networks, and hence facilitate better stylization. Empowered by Matting Laplacian training loss which can address the pixel affinity loss problem led by the linear transform, the proposed framework is applicable and effective on versatile style transfer. Extensive experiments show that CAP-VSTNet can produce better qualitative and quantitative results in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "内容相关性的损失问题一直是引起照片逼真及视频风格转化中产生伪影的主要原因。本文提出了一种名为CAP-VSTNet的全新框架，它由全新的可逆残差网络和无偏的线性转换模块组成，用于实现多功能风格转换。这种可逆残差网络不仅能够保留内容相关性，而且不会像传统的可逆网络一样引入冗余信息，从而实现更好的风格化效果。在解决由线性转换引起的像素相关性损失问题的Matting Laplacian训练损失的支持下，所提出的框架在多功能风格转换中具有适用性和有效性。广泛的实验结果表明，CAP-VSTNet与现有的最先进方法相比，能够产生更好的定性和定量结果。",
