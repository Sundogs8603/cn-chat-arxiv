    "translated_abstract": "神经网络在许多领域中都有深刻的应用，但在具有数十亿个参数的巨型模型时代，针对商业应用进行优化和部署可能需要大量的计算和财务资源。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了 Tetra-AML 工具箱，通过自定义的黑盒张量矩阵优化算法 TetraOpt 自动完成神经网络结构搜索和超参数优化。该工具箱还提供模型压缩功能，包括量化和剪枝，并使用张量网络来实现压缩。在这里，我们分析了用于在计算机视觉任务中优化神经网络的统一基准，并展示了我们的方法在 CIFAR-10 数据集上相对于贝叶斯优化的卓越性能。我们还展示了 ResNet-18 神经网络的压缩，其中我们使用的内存只有原来的 1/14.5，同时仅损失了 3.2％ 的准确度。所呈现的框架是通用的，不仅限于计算机视觉问题。",
