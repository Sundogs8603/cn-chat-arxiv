    "translated_abstract": "跨学科研究已成为创新和发现的温床。基金支持的研究越来越占主导地位，与此同时，对资助跨学科工作的兴趣日益增长，这引发了关于跨学科拨款在支持高影响跨学科进展中的作用的根本问题。在这里，我们开发了一个测量框架，来量化研究基金和出版物的跨学科性，并将其应用于来自164个资助机构、26个国家的35万个拨款和从1985年到2009年承认这些拨款支持的130万篇论文。我们的分析揭示了两种矛盾的模式。一方面，跨学科基金往往会产生跨学科论文，而跨学科论文与高影响力相关。另一方面，与学科基金相比，跨学科基金产生的论文更少，而支持的跨学科论文影响力也大大下降。我们表明",

It found that interdisciplinary grants tend to produce interdisciplinary papers, which are associated with high impact. However, compared to disciplinary grants, interdisciplinary grants produce fewer papers and the impact of supported interdisciplinary papers decreases."
