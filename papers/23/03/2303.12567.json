    "abstract": "The paper was prompted by the surprising discovery that the common strategy, adopted in a large body of research, for producing macroeconomic equilibrium in certain heterogeneous-agent incomplete-market models fails to locate the equilibrium in a widely cited benchmark study. By mimicking the approach proposed by Dumas and Lyasoff (2012), the paper provides a novel description of the law of motion of the distribution over the range of private states of a large population of interacting economic agents faced with uninsurable aggregate and idiosyncratic risk. A new algorithm for identifying the returns, the optimal private allocations, and the population transport in the state of equilibrium is developed and is tested in two well known benchmark studies.",
