    "abstract": "Image matching is a classic and fundamental task in computer vision. In this paper, under the hypothesis that the areas outside the co-visible regions carry little information, we propose a matching key-points crop (MKPC) algorithm. The MKPC locates, proposes and crops the critical regions, which are the co-visible areas with great efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, building upon MKPC, we propose a general two-stage pipeline for image matching, which is compatible to any image matching models or combinations. We experimented with plugging SuperPoint + SuperGlue into the two-stage pipeline, whose results show that our method enhances the performance for outdoor pose estimations. What's more, in a fair comparative condition, our method outperforms the SOTA on Image Matching Challenge 2022 Benchmark, which represents the hardest outdoor benchmark of image matching currently.",

    "translated_abstract": "图像匹配在计算机视觉领域是一个经典且基础的任务。本文假设共视区域外部的区域几乎不包含有用的信息，通过提出一个特征点裁剪算法(MKPC)，定位、提取和裁剪包含重要信息的共视区域，该算法具有高效和准确性。此外，我们基于MKPC提出了一个通用的二阶段管线用于图像匹配，它对于任何图像匹配模型或组合都适用。我们在此基础上，通过将SuperPoint + SuperGlue作为图像匹配模型，进行了实验，结果显示我们的方法在户外位姿估计方面提高了性能。此外，在公平的比较条件下，我们的方法超越了2022年图像匹配挑战赛基准，该基准代表目前最难的户外图像匹配任务。",
