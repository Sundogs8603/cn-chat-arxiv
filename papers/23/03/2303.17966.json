    "translated_abstract": "GCN及其变种模型的信息扩散性能受邻接矩阵限制，这可能会降低它们的性能。因此，我们介绍了一种名为混合扩散图卷积网络（HD-GCN）的新框架，以解决邻接矩阵造成的信息扩散限制。在HD-GCN框架中，我们首先利用扩散映射来促进在特征空间中相邻节点之间的信息扩散。这允许在没有相邻关系的情况下，在相似点之间进行信息扩散。接下来，我们在扩散映射之后利用图卷积进一步传播相邻节点之间的信息，从而实现在图中相邻相似节点之间的信息传播。最后，我们采用通过使用扩散映射获得的扩散距离对训练标签的预测进行正则化和约束。",

HD-GCN utilizes diffusion maps to facilitate diffusion between non-adjacent but similar nodes and graph convolution to propagate information among adjacent nodes. The predicted labels of training are regularized and constrained with the diffusion distances obtained through the use of diffusion maps."
