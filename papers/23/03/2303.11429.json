    "translated_abstract": "心血管疾病在现代社会仍是一个重大问题。在非侵入性技术中，心电图（ECG）是检测心脏活动异常最可靠的方法之一。然而，ECG解读需要专业知识且耗时。开发一种新的方法可以及早检测疾病可能会防止死亡和并发症。本文提出了几种新的方法来从ECG记录中分类心脏疾病。第一种方法建议使用ECG信号的泊松分布表示和基于深度学习的图像分类器（ResNet50和DenseNet121学习了泊松分布），在预测房颤方面表现不错但不能预测其他类型的心律失常。XGBoost，一种梯度提升模型，在长期数据中表现良好但由于预处理阶段中高耗时计算，推断时间较长。最后，一维卷积模型特别适用于长期ECG记录分类和推断。",
