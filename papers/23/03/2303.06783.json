    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是机器学习领域的一个新发展，它允许设备的系统在一个或多个任务上进行训练，而无需将其数据共享到单个位置或设备。然而，该框架仍然需要一个集中的全局模型来将个体模型合并为一个，并且设备进行同步训练，这两者都可能成为使用联邦学习的潜在瓶颈。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的异步分散的联邦终身学习 (ADFLL) 方法，它继承了联邦学习的优点，可以同时在多个任务上进行训练，而无需中央节点或同步训练。从而克服了传统联邦学习的潜在缺点。我们在脑肿瘤分割 (BRATS) 数据集上展示了卓越的性能，用于定位多个图像序列和图像方向的左室。我们的框架允许代理商以平均距离达到最佳性能。",
