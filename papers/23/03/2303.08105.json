    "abstract": "This project concerns developing and validating an image guidance framework for application to a robotic-assisted fibular reduction in ankle fracture surgery. The aim is to produce and demonstrate proper functioning of software for automatic determination of directions for fibular repositioning with the ultimate goal of application to a robotic reduction procedure that can reduce the time and complexity of the procedure as well as provide the benefits of reduced error in ideal final fibular position, improved syndesmosis restoration and reduced incidence of post-traumatic osteoarthritis. The focus of this product will be developing and testing the image guidance software, from the input of preoperative images through the steps of automated segmentation and registration until the output of a final transformation that can be used as instructions to a robot on how to reposition the fibula, but will not involve developing or implementing the hardware of the robot itself.",
