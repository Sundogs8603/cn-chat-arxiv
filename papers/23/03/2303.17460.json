    "translated_abstract": "关系事件是社交互动的一种类型，有时被称为动态网络。它的动态通常取决于新兴的模式，即内生变量，或外部力量，即外生变量。然而，对于网络中的行为者，尤其是对于大型网络，全面的信息是罕见的。网络分析中的潜在空间方法是解释驱动网络配置的未测量协变量的流行方式。贝叶斯和EM类型的算法已被提出用于推断潜在空间，但是许多社交网络应用程序的规模以及过程（因此是潜在空间）的动态特性使得计算变得极其昂贵。在本项工作中，我们提出了一种基于可能性的算法，可以处理巨型关系事件网络。我们提出了一种嵌入到可解释的潜在空间中的推断网络社区动态的分层策略。节点动态是通过向后概率推断的贝叶斯统计模型实现的。",
