    "translated_abstract": "选择股票组合并评估与整个市场、市场指数或其他股票组合相比的相对波动风险对于专业基金经理和个人投资者都非常重要。我们的研究使用横向内部熵 (CSIE) 模型来估计可以一起被视为组合成分的股票组的横向波动率。在我们的研究中，我们将投资组合的波动风险与由 CSIE 提供的整个市场的波动性以及使用纵向数据计算出的市场指数的波动性进行基准测试。本文介绍了基于 CSIE 的 beta 值，以表征投资组合相对于市场指数和整个市场的相对波动风险。我们通过基于 CSIE 的 beta 值实证证明了多种符号集合在维持与市场指数相同的风险水平或甚至更低的风险水平而实现超过市场指数的收益率。",
