    "abstract": "Complex IoT ecosystems often require the usage of Digital Twins (DTs) of their physical assets in order to perform predictive analytics and simulate what-if scenarios. DTs are able to replicate IoT devices and adapt over time to their behavioral changes. However, DTs in IoT are typically tailored to a specific use case, without the possibility to seamlessly adapt to different scenarios. Further, the fragmentation of IoT poses additional challenges on how to deploy DTs in heterogeneous scenarios characterized by the usage of multiple data formats and IoT network protocols. In this paper, we propose the Relativistic Digital Twin (RDT) framework, through which we automatically generate general-purpose DTs of IoT entities and tune their behavioral models over time by constantly observing their real counterparts. The framework relies on the object representation via the Web of Things (WoT), to offer a standardized interface to each of the IoT devices as well as to their DTs. To this purpose",

    "translated_abstract": "复杂的物联网生态系统通常需要使用其物理资产的数字孪生（DT）来进行预测分析和模拟“假设”情景。数字孪生能够复制物联网设备，并随着时间的推移适应其行为变化。然而，物联网中的数字孪生通常针对特定的用例，无法无缝适应不同的情境。此外，物联网的碎片化使得在具有多种数据格式和物联网网络协议的异构情景中部署数字孪生更具挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了相对论数字孪生（RDT）框架，通过该框架我们可以自动生成物联网实体的通用型数字孪生，并通过不断观察其真实对应物来调整其行为模型。该框架依赖于通过物联网之物（WoT）来进行对象表示，为每个物联网设备及其数字孪生提供标准化接口。",
