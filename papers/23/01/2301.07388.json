    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method for learning deformation trajectories of Boltzmann densities by interpolating energy functions, finding a time-dependent vector field, and transporting samples from one distribution to another. The experimental results show the advantages over KL-divergence on Gaussian mixtures and the Boltzmann density of a quantum mechanical particle in a double-well potential."
