    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel self-supervised based Cut-and-Paste GAN to perform foreground object segmentation and generate realistic composite images without manual annotations. We accomplish this goal by a simple yet effective self-supervised approach coupled with the U-Net based discriminator. The proposed method extends the ability of the standard discriminators to learn not only the global data representations via classification (real/fake) but also learn semantic and structural information through pseudo labels created using the self-supervised task. The proposed method empowers the generator to create meaningful masks by forcing it to learn informative per-pixel as well as global image feedback from the discriminator. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于自监督的 Cut-and-Paste GAN，用于进行前景对象分割并生成逼真的组合图像，无需手动标注。通过一个简单而有效的自监督方法，结合基于 U-Net 的鉴别器，完成了这一目标。该方法扩展了标准鉴别器的能力，不仅通过分类（真/假）学习全局数据表示，而且还通过使用自监督任务创建的伪标签学习语义和结构信息。该方法使生成器能够通过强制它从辨别器学习每像素的有意义的信息和全局图像反馈来创建有意义的遮罩。实验表明，我们提出的方法在标准基准数据集上显著优于现有最先进方法。",
