    "translated_abstract": "在过去几年中，深度学习在组织病理学应用领域的使用有所增加。然而，尽管这些方法展示了巨大的潜力，在高风险环境中，深度学习模型需要能够判断其不确定性，并在存在较大的错误分类风险时能够拒绝输入。在这项工作中，我们对最常用的用于分类整个切片图像的不确定性和鲁棒性方法进行了严格评价，重点关注选择性分类的任务，在这个任务中，模型应在不确定的情况下拒绝分类。我们在领域转移和标签噪声方面对切片级别和瓦片级别进行了实验。在实验中，我们比较了深度集成、蒙特卡洛丢弃、随机变分推断、测试时数据增强以及后两种方法的集合。我们观察到，方法的集合通常会产生更好的结果。",
