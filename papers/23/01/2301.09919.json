    "translated_abstract": "设计对话辅导系统一直是一项具有挑战性的工作，因为它涉及到对人类辅导者所采用的多样且复杂的教学策略进行建模。尽管在大型语言模型 (LLMs) 和可用的对话语料库方面出现了显著的进展，但对话辅导在很大程度上仍未受到这些进展的影响。本文在两个语言学习对话辅导数据集上对各种生成式语言模型进行了严格分析，使用自动和人工评估来了解这些进展带来的新机会以及我们必须克服的挑战，以构建能在真实教育环境中使用的模型。我们发现，尽管当前方法可以对少量概念和可能的教师策略进行较好的辅导模拟与学习，但在不受限制的情况下表现不佳。我们的人工质量评估显示，模型和基础教学系统在这些不受限制的情况下都具有较低的有效性，这表明未来的研究应该集中在解决这些问题上。",
