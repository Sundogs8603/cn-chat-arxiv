    "translated_abstract": "近年来，联邦学习 (FL) 作为一种分布式设备学习范式受到了越来越多的关注。然而，在具有层次结构的真实物联网 (IoT) 网络中部署FL仍然面临着多重挑战。虽然现有的研究已经提出了各种方法来解决数据异质性、系统异质性、意外延迟者和可扩展性等问题，但没有一种方法提供一个系统性的解决方案来应对分层和不可靠的IoT网络中的所有挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一个异步和分层框架 (Async-HFL)，用于在常见的三层IoT网络结构中执行FL。针对大量不同的延迟，Async-HFL在网关和云级别均采用异步聚合，从而避免长时间等待。为了充分发挥在系统异质性和延迟者下异步HFL的收敛速度潜力，我们分别设计了网关级别的设备选择和云级别的设备网关调度。结果表明，Async-HFL在收敛速度、鲁棒性和可扩展性方面优于现有的FL算法。",
