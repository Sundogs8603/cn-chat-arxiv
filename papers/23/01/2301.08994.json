    "abstract": "arXiv:2301.08994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Both the Bayes factor and the relative belief ratio satisfy the principle of evidence and so can be seen to be valid measures of statistical evidence. Certainly Bayes factors are regularly employed. The question then is: which of these measures of evidence is more appropriate? It is argued here that there are questions concerning the validity of a current commonly used definition of the Bayes factor based on a mixture prior and, when all is considered, the relative belief ratio has better properties as a measure of evidence. It is further shown that, when a natural restriction on the mixture prior is imposed, the Bayes factor equals the relative belief ratio obtained without using the mixture prior. Even with this restriction, this still leaves open the question of how the strength of evidence is to be measured. It is argued here that the current practice of using the size of the Bayes factor to measure strength is not correct ",

    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯因子和相对信念比都满足证据原则，因此可以被看作是统计证据的有效度量。贝叶斯因子经常被使用。问题在于：这些证据的度量哪一个更合适？本文认为，对基于混合先验的当前常用贝叶斯因子定义的有效性存在疑问，而从整体考虑，相对信念比作为证据的度量具有更好的性质。此外还表明，当对混合先验施加一项自然限制时，贝叶斯因子等于不使用混合先验得出的相对信念比。即使受到此限制，如何衡量证据的强度仍然是个待解问题。本文认为，目前的做法是使用贝叶斯因子的大小来衡量强度是不正确的。",
