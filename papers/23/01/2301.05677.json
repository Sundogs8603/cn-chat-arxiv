    "abstract": "Using high-quality data, we report several statistical regularities of equity auctions in the Paris stock exchange. First, the average order book density is linear around the auction price at the time of auction clearing and has a large peak at the auction price. While the peak is due to slow traders, the order density shape is the result of subtle dynamics. The impact of a new market order or cancellation at the auction time can be decomposed into three parts as a function of the size of the additional order: (1) zero impact, caused by the discrete nature of prices, sometimes up to a surprisingly large additional volume relative to the auction volume (2) linear impact for additional orders up to a large fraction of the auction volume (3) for even larger orders price impact is non-linear, frequently super-linear.",

    "translated_abstract": "通过使用高质量数据，我们报告了巴黎证券交易所股票拍卖的几个统计规律。首先，拍卖清算时的平均订单簿密度在拍卖价格附近是线性的，并在拍卖价格处有一个大峰值。虽然峰值是由于慢速交易者造成的，但订单密度形状是微妙动态的结果。在拍卖时间进行的新市场订单或取消可以通过附加订单的大小将其影响分解为三个部分：（1）零影响，由于价格的离散性，有时相对于拍卖量具有惊人的大附加量（2）对于多达拍卖量较大一部分的附加订单，线性影响（3）对于更大的订单，价格影响是非线性的，频繁超线性。",
