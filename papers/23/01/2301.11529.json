    "abstract": "Layout design is an important task in various design fields, including user interface, document, and graphic design. As this task requires tedious manual effort by designers, prior works have attempted to automate this process using generative models, but commonly fell short of providing intuitive user controls and achieving design objectives. In this paper, we build a conditional latent diffusion model, PLay, that generates parametrically conditioned layouts in vector graphic space from user-specified guidelines, which are commonly used by designers for representing their design intents in current practices. Our method outperforms prior works across three datasets on metrics including FID and FD-VG, and in user study. Moreover, it brings a novel and interactive experience to professional layout design processes.",

    "translated_abstract": "布局设计是各种设计领域（包括用户界面、文档和图形设计）中的重要任务。由于此任务需要设计师付出繁琐的手动努力，先前的工作尝试使用生成模型自动化此过程，但通常无法提供直观的用户控制和实现设计目标。在本文中，我们构建了一个有条件的潜在扩散模型 PLay，它从用户指定的指南中生成矢量图空间中的参数化条件布局。这些指南通常由设计师在当前实践中用于表示他们的设计意图。我们的方法在包括 FID 和 FD-VG 的三个数据集和用户研究中优于以前的工作。此外，它为专业布局设计流程带来了一种新颖和互动的体验。",
