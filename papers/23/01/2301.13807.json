    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习（ML）驱动的自主系统（MLAS）中，确定ML组件（MLCs）的危险边界对于分析中的MLAS至关重要。鉴于这种边界可以捕捉到导致危险的MLC行为和系统背景条件，例如，在达到危险边界时，可以构建一个安全监视器，可以在运行时采取任何预定义的回退机制。然而，确定ML组件的这种危险边界是具有挑战性的。这是由于问题空间将系统环境（即场景）和MLC行为（即输入和输出）组合在一起，过于庞大，无法通过全面的探索甚至是传统的元启发式算法，如遗传算法来处理。此外，确定任何MLAS安全违规所需的模拟的高计算成本使问题更加具有挑战性。此外，以确定性地考虑问题空间中的一个区域是不切实际的。",
