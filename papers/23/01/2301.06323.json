    "abstract": "Although existing neural network approaches have achieved great success on Chinese spelling correction, there is still room to improve. The model is required to avoid over-correction and to distinguish a correct token from its phonological and visually similar ones. In this paper, we propose an error-guided correction model (EGCM) to improve Chinese spelling correction. By borrowing the powerful ability of BERT, we propose a novel zero-shot error detection method to do a preliminary detection, which guides our model to attend more on the probably wrong tokens in encoding and to avoid modifying the correct tokens in generating. Furthermore, we introduce a new loss function to integrate the error confusion set, which enables our model to distinguish easily misused tokens. Moreover, our model supports highly parallel decoding to meet real application requirements. Experiments are conducted on widely used benchmarks. Our model achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art approach",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然现有的神经网络方法在汉语拼写纠错方面取得了巨大成功，但仍有进一步提高的空间。在本文中，我们提出了一个误差引导的纠错模型（EGCM）来改进汉语拼写纠错。通过借鉴BERT的强大能力，我们提出了一种新的零-shot误差检测方法来进行初步检测，这样可以指导我们的模型在编码时更多地关注可能错误的标记，并在生成时避免修改正确的标记。此外，我们还引入了新的损失函数来集成误差混淆集，这使得我们的模型能够轻松区分易混淆的标记。此外，我们的模型支持高度并行的解码，以满足实际应用的要求。我们在广泛使用的基准测试中进行了实验。我们的模型优于先进方法。",
