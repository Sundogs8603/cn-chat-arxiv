    "translated_abstract": "Reed-Muller（RM）码在一般的二进制输入无记忆对称信道上达到容量，并且据推测，在比例定律方面的性能与随机码相当。但是，这些结果是建立在对一般码参数使用最大似然译码器的情况下的。此外，RM码只能接受有限的码率集。对于有限长度的RM码，已经有诸如连续取消列表（SCL）译码器和最近引入的递归投影聚合（RPA）译码器等高效译码器可用。本文我们研究具有灵活码率的RM码子码。首先我们将RPA译码算法扩展到RM子码上。为了降低我们的译码算法（称为subRPA）的复杂性，我们研究了不同的投影剪枝方法。接下来，我们推导出基于软判断的版本，称为soft-subRPA，它不仅改进了subRPA的性能，还使得译码算法可微分。",
