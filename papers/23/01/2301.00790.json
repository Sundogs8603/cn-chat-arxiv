    "translated_abstract": "由于严重的非平稳性，将深度学习算法应用于时序面板数据集是困难的，这可能导致过度拟合的模型在制度变化下性能不佳。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的机器学习管道，用于在数据制度变化下对时序面板数据集的预测进行排名。管道评估不同的机器学习模型，包括梯度提升决策树（GBDT）和具有和不具有简单特征工程的神经网络。我们发现，具有dropout的GBDT模型具有高性能、稳健性和泛化能力，而且相对复杂度较低、计算成本较低。然后，我们展示了在线学习技术可以在预测后处理中用于增强结果。特别地，我们提出了动态特征中和，这是一种无需重新训练模型就可以应用于任何机器学习模型的高效过程。",
