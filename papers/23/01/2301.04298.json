    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了任务导向通信中的信息时代概念，旨在利用发射机处的数据在接收器处执行任务。发射机和接收机之间的操作被建模为一个联合训练的编码器-解码器对，并考虑了信道效应。编码器将数据样本转换为小维度的特征向量，并使用少量的信道用于传输，从而减少了传输次数和延迟。解码器不再重构输入样本，而是对接收到的信号执行任务，例如分类。通过在MNIST和CIFAR-10图像数据集上应用不同的编码器-解码器深度神经网络，显示分类器的准确性随着信道利用率的增加而提高，但需要更长的服务时间。引入任务信息的最大时代（PAoTI）来分析准确性和延迟权衡的时机，当信息年龄增长时，除非接收到的信号被正确分类。通过结合通道和源的影响对PAoTI进行了分析，结果表明PAoTI与通道的影响趋势一致，但概述误差可能增加。",
