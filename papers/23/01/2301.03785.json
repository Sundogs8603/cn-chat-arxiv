    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在固定置信水平下，随机多臂赌博机中最佳臂识别（BAI）的一个未曾解决的方面。评估赌博算法的两个关键指标是计算效率和性能最优性（例如采样复杂度）。在随机BAI文献中，已经有了设计算法以实现最优性能的进展，但它们通常计算上昂贵（例如基于优化的方法）。也存在计算效率高的方法，但它们与最优性能之间存在可证明的差距（例如，前两种方法中的$\\beta$-最优方法）。本文介绍了一种BAI框架和算法，该算法通过一组计算上高效的决策规则实现了最优性能。实现这一点的中心流程是一个按顺序估计最佳分配的例程，直到足够准确地估计为止。具体而言，这些估计是准确的。",
