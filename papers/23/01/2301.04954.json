    "translated_abstract": "由于组件的尺寸和成本的减少，卫星变得更加普遍可用。因此，越来越多的小型组织有能力部署卫星，并在其上运行各种数据密集型应用程序。一个流行的应用是图像分析，用于检测地面、冰、云等地球观测。然而，卫星上部署的设备资源受限，这为这种资源密集型应用程序带来了额外的挑战。本文介绍了我们在构建卫星图像处理单元（IPU）方面的工作和经验教训。我们首先调查了多种边缘设备（比较CPU、GPU、TPU和VPU）在卫星上基于深度学习的图像处理方面的性能。我们的目标是找到能够在满足卫星功耗和延迟限制的同时，在工作负载变化时能够实现准确结果和灵活性的设备。我们的结果表明",
