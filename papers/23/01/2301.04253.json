    "abstract": "The topic of Climate Change (CC) has received limited attention in NLP despite its urgency. Activists and policymakers need NLP tools to effectively process the vast and rapidly growing unstructured textual climate reports into structured form. To tackle this challenge we introduce two new large-scale climate questionnaire datasets and use their existing structure to train self-supervised models. We conduct experiments to show that these models can learn to generalize to climate disclosures of different organizations types than seen during training. We then use these models to help align texts from unstructured climate documents to the semi-structured questionnaires in a human pilot study. Finally, to support further NLP research in the climate domain we introduce a benchmark of existing climate text classification datasets to better evaluate and compare existing models.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管气候变化问题紧迫，但在自然语言处理领域对其的关注有限。行动者和政策制定者需要自然语言处理工具，能够有效地将庞大且快速增长的非结构化文本气候报告转化为结构化形式。为了应对这一挑战，我们引入了两个新的大规模气候问卷数据集，并利用其现有结构来训练自监督模型。我们进行实验表明，这些模型能够学习到对训练过程中未见的不同组织类型的气候披露进行泛化。然后，我们使用这些模型在人类试验中帮助将非结构化气候文档中的文本与半结构化问卷对齐。最后，为了支持气候领域进一步的自然语言处理研究，我们引入了一个现有气候文本分类数据集的基准，以更好地评估和比较现有模型。",
