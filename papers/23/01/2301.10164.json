Each climbing session must be analyzed from beginning till lowering of the climber. Therefore, spotting the climbers descending is crucial since it indicates when the ascent has come to an end. This problem must be addressed while preserving privacy and convenience of the climbers and the costs of the gyms. To this aim, a hardware prototype is developed to collect data using accelerometer sensors attached to a piece of climbing equipment mounted on the wall, called quickdraw, that connects the climbing rope to the bolt anchors. The corresponding sensors are configured to be energy-efficient, hence become practical in terms of expenses and time consumption for replacement when using in large quantity in a climbing gym.

    "translated_abstract": "跟踪攀岩者的活动以改善服务并最大限度地利用他们的基础设施是攀岩健身房关注的焦点。必须从开始分析每个攀岩活动直到攀登者降下来。因此，发现攀岩者下降是至关重要的，因为这标志着攀登结束。必须在保护攀岩者和健身房成本隐私和便利性的同时解决这个问题。为此，开发了一个硬件原型，使用附在墙上的攀岩设备上的加速度传感器收集数据，称为快挂，它连接攀岩绳和螺栓锚点。相应的传感器被配置为节能，因此在攀岩健身房大量使用时在费用和更换所需时间方面变得实用。本文描述了硬件规格，并研究了传感器测得的数据。",
