Over the years, various studies have found that machine learning models can effectively discriminate malware from benign applications.

In this paper, we reimplement 18 representative past works and reevaluate them using a balanced, relevant, and up-to-date dataset comprising 124,000 applications. We also carry out new experiments designed to fill holes in existing knowledge, and use our findings to identify the most effective features and models to use for Android malware detection within a contemporary environment. We show that high detection accuracies (up to 96.8%) can be achieved using features extracted through static analysis alone, yielding a mode",

    "translated_abstract": "Android的普及意味着它成为恶意软件的常见目标。多年来，各种研究发现机器学习模型能够有效区分恶意软件和良性应用程序。然而，随着操作系统的演进，恶意软件也在不断发展，对先前研究的发现提出了质疑，其中许多报告称使用小型、过时且经常不平衡的数据集能够获得非常高的准确性。在本文中，我们重新实现了18项具代表性的过去研究并使用包括124,000个应用程序的平衡、相关且最新的数据集对它们进行重新评估。我们还进行了新的实验，以填补现有知识中的空白，并利用研究结果确定在当代环境中用于安卓恶意软件检测的最有效特征和模型。我们表明，仅通过静态分析提取的特征即可实现高达96.8%的检测准确性。",
