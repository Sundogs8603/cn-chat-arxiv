    "translated_abstract": "将视觉刺激分割为特征和视觉对象的不同组是视觉功能的核心。经典的心理物理方法揭示了许多有关人类感知分割的规则，而最近在机器学习方面的进展已经产生了成功的算法。然而，人类分割的计算逻辑仍不清楚，部分原因是因为我们缺乏可控制的范例来测量感知分割图并定量比较模型。在这里，我们提出了一种新的综合方法：给定一张图片，我们测量多个基于像素的相同-不同判断，并对潜在的分割图进行基于模型的重建。重建对多种实验操作具有鲁棒性，并捕捉了个体参与者的变异性。我们在人类对自然图像和复合材料纹理的分割上验证了该方法的准确性。我们表明图像的不确定性影响了人类的可变性的测量，并影响了参与者的决策。",
