    "translated_abstract": "诊断和清理数据是构建健壮的机器学习系统的关键步骤。但是，由于存在复杂问题，如标签错误、欠表示和异常值，因此在具有真实世界分布的大规模数据集中识别问题具有挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了一种利用特征嵌入空间中数据的关系结构这一被忽视的信息来源，来识别有问题的数据的统一方法。为此，我们提出了基于数据的关系图结构来检测标签错误和异常数据的可扩展和有效的算法。我们进一步引入了一种可视化工具，提供特征嵌入空间中数据点的上下文信息，作为交互式诊断数据的有效工具。我们在大规模图像、语音和语言领域任务中评估了我们方法的标签错误和离群值/分布外（OOD）检测性能。",
