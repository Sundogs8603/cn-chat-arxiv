    "abstract": "Motion prediction for automated vehicles in complex environments is a difficult task that is to be mastered when automated vehicles are to be used in arbitrary situations. Many factors influence the future motion of traffic participants starting with traffic rules and reaching from the interaction between each other to personal habits of human drivers. Therefore we present a novel approach for a graph-based prediction based on a heterogeneous holistic graph representation that combines temporal information, properties and relations between traffic participants as well as relations with static elements like the road network. The information are encoded through different types of nodes and edges that both are enriched with arbitrary features. We evaluated the approach on the INTERACTION and the Argoverse dataset and conducted an informative ablation study to demonstrate the benefit of different types of information for the motion prediction quality.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶车辆在复杂环境下的运动预测是一个困难的任务，在自动驾驶车辆在不同情况下被使用时需要掌握。许多因素影响着交通参与者的未来动向，从交通规则、相互交互到人类驾驶员的个人习惯。因此，我们提出了一种基于全局图形的预测方法，该方法基于一个综合性异构图形表示，结合了交通参与者之间的时空信息、属性和关系以及与道路网络等静态元素的关系。通过不同类型的节点和边缘来编码信息，两者都具备任意特性。我们在INTERACTION和Argoverse数据集上评估了该方法，并进行了信息消融研究，以证明各种信息对运动预测质量的益处。",
