    "abstract": "Structural learning, which aims to learn directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data, is foundational to causal reasoning and scientific discovery. Recent advancements formulate structural learning into a continuous optimization problem; however, DAG learning remains a highly non-convex problem, and there has not been much work on leveraging well-developed convex optimization techniques for causal structural learning. We fill this gap by proposing a data-adaptive linear approach for causal structural learning from time series data, which can be conveniently cast into a convex optimization problem using a recently developed monotone operator variational inequality (VI) formulation. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic recovery guarantee of the VI-based approach and show the superior performance of our proposed method on structure recovery over existing methods via extensive numerical experiments.",

    "translated_abstract": "结构学习旨在从观察数据中学习有向无环图(DAG)，是因果推理和科学发现的基础。最近的进展将结构学习转化为连续优化问题；然而，DAG学习仍然是一个高度非凸问题，因此很少有工作利用成熟的凸优化技术进行因果结构学习。我们通过提出一种适用于时间序列数据的数据自适应线性方法来填补这一空白，并使用最近提出的单调算子变分不等式(VI)公式方便地将其转化为凸优化问题。此外，我们还建立了VI方法的非渐近恢复保证，并通过大量的数值实验展示了我们提出的方法在结构恢复方面优于现有方法。",
