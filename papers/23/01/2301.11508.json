    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体平台是分享自我健康经历的重要资源，提供各种健康话题的丰富数据。尽管自然语言处理（NLP）的进步使得能够对大规模社交媒体数据进行分析，但在将关键词提取应用于健康相关内容方面仍存在差距。关键词提取用于在社交媒体话语中识别显著概念，而不受预定义实体类别的限制。本文介绍了一种针对社交媒体的主题驱动的关键词提取框架，这是一种开创性的方法，旨在从用户生成的健康文本中捕获临床相关的关键词。主题是由提取任务的目标确定的广泛类别。我们制定了这个新颖的主题驱动的关键词提取任务，并展示了它在高效挖掘社交媒体文本，用于防治阿片类物质使用障碍的用例中的潜力。本文利用了定性和定量分析。",
