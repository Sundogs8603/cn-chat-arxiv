    "abstract": "The small amount of training data for many state-of-the-art deep learning-based Face Recognition (FR) systems causes a marked deterioration in their performance. Although a considerable amount of research has addressed this issue by inventing new data augmentation techniques, using either input space transformations or Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for feature space augmentations, these techniques have yet to satisfy expectations. In this paper, we propose an approach named the Face Representation Augmentation (FRA) for augmenting face datasets. To the best of our knowledge, FRA is the first method that shifts its focus towards manipulating the face embeddings generated by any face representation learning algorithm to create new embeddings representing the same identity and facial emotion but with an altered posture. Extensive experiments conducted in this study convince of the efficacy of our methodology and its power to provide noiseless, completely new facial representations",

    "translated_abstract": "目前大部分基于深度学习的人脸识别系统由于训练数据量不足而表现出明显的性能下降。尽管很多研究已经研发了新的数据增强技术，包括输入空间的变换和生成对抗网络（GAN）的特征空间增强，但这些技术仍无法满足预期。本文提出了一种名为面部表示增强（FRA）的方法，用于增强人脸数据集。据我们所知，FRA是第一个将重点放在通过任何面部表示学习算法生成的面部嵌入来创建代表相同身份和面部情感但具有改变姿势的新嵌入的方法。本研究进行了大量实验证明了我们方法的有效性和其提供无噪声、全新的面部表示的能力。",
