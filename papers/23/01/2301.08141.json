    "translated_abstract": "帕金森病是人类中第二常见的神经退行性疾病，其特点是大脑黑质中多巴胺神经元逐渐丧失。在评估帕金森病动物模型的药物疗效时，计数大脑黑质中的多巴胺神经元是最重要的指标之一。目前，通过数字病理学图像分析人工进行多巴胺神经元的分析和计量，这种方法耗时费力且高度主观。因此，需要一种可靠且无偏见的自动化系统来对数字病理学图像中的多巴胺神经元进行计量。近年来，在医学图像处理中普遍采用深度学习解决方案。然而，开发高性能的深度学习模型取决于大规模、高质量的标注数据的可用性，这在数字病理学图像分析等应用中可能成本高昂。为此，我们提出了一种新的自监督学习方法，以克服数据标注的困难并实现对数字病理学图像中多巴胺神经元的准确分割和计量。",
