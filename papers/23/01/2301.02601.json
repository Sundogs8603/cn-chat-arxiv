Therefore, tracing the impact of the chosen circuit architecture and parameterization is crucial for the development of beneficially applicable hybrid methods.

    "translated_abstract": "近期，将量子计算等新的计算范式应用于机器学习领域引起了广泛关注。然而，由于高维实际应用程序目前尚无法使用纯量子硬件进行求解，因此提出了使用经典和量子机器学习范式的混合方法。例如，迁移学习方法已成功应用于混合图像分类任务中。然而，仍需要探索有益的电路架构。因此，跟踪所选电路架构和参数化的影响对于开发有益的混合方法至关重要。然而，当前的方法包括同时训练两个部分的过程，因此不能严格分离经典和量子影响。因此，这些架构可能会产生具有卓越预测准确性的模型，同时采用最少量的量子影响。",
