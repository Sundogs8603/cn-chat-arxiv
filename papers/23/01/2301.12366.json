    "translated_abstract": "在许多在线决策应用中，环境都是非平稳的，因此使用能够处理变化的赌博算法至关重要。大多数现有方法是为了保护非平滑变化而设计的，仅受到总变差或时间上的Lipschitz性的限制，其中它们保证$\\tilde \\Theta(T^{2/3})$的遗憾。然而，在实践中，环境经常以平稳的方式改变，因此这种算法可能会在这些设置中产生比必要更高的遗憾，并且不利用变化率的信息。我们研究了一个非平稳的两臂赌博机问题，假设臂的平均回报是一个$\\beta$-H\\''older函数，即它是$(\\beta-1)$次Lipschitz连续可微分的，我们展示了一个策略，对于$\\beta=2$，它的遗憾为$\\tilde O(T^{3/5})$，从而首次在平滑和非平滑之间进行了区分。我们通过一个任意$\\Omg(T^{(\\beta+1)/(2\\beta+1)})$的下界来补充这个结果，说明了这个问题的困难程度。",
