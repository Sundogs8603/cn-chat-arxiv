    "translated_abstract": "信息传递式图神经网络（GNN）在同质图上表现出色。然而，在异质图上它们的性能却很差，许多研究者为解决这个问题提出了大量方案。特别地，翻转边的符号是基于坚实理论基础的并且可以获得显著的性能提升。然而，以前的分析假定了二元分类场景，因此受到应用范围的限制。本文将以前的理解扩展到多类别情况，并指出两个缺点：（1）多跳邻居的符号取决于消息传递路径，可能导致不一致性；（2）这也增加了预测的不确定性（例如，冲突证据），可能影响算法的稳定性。在理论的基础上，我们提出了一种新的策略，适用于多类别的图。所提出的方案结合了原有方案的优点，同时克服了其缺点并取得了显著的性能提升。",
