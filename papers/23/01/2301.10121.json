    "translated_abstract": "未来的协作机器人必须具备寻找物体的能力。作为一项基本技能，我们预计目标搜索最终会成为任何机器人的现成能力，类似于物体检测、SLAM和运动规划等。然而，现有的方法要么做出不切实际的妥协（例如将问题从3D缩减到2D），要么采用专门的贪婪搜索策略，或者试图在模拟中学习端到端策略，这些策略尚未在真实机器人和环境中得到推广。该论文认为，通过利用部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）来建模目标搜索，同时利用人类世界（例如八叉树、相关性）和人机交互中的结构（例如空间语言），可以实现一种实用有效的广义目标搜索系统。为了支持这一论点，我开发了在有限视野、遮挡和噪声存在的不确定性下，在3D环境中进行（多个）目标搜索的方法和系统，并在模拟和真实场景中进行了评估。",
