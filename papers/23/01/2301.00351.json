    "translated_abstract": "该论文提出了一种无偏场景图生成(SGG)算法，称为偏斜类平衡重加权(SCR)，旨在考虑长尾分布所导致的无偏谓词预测。以往研究主要集中在缓解较小的谓词预测的性能下降，显示了急剧下降的召回得分，即失去了大多数谓词的性能。这还没有正确分析有限SGG数据集中多数谓词性能和少数谓词性能之间的权衡。为了缓解这个问题，本文考虑了偏斜类平衡重加权(SCR)损失函数，并应用于无偏SGG模型。利用偏斜谓词预测的斜率，SCR估计目标谓词权重系数，然后重新为偏斜谓词加权，以更好地权衡大多数谓词和少数谓词。在标准Visual Genome数据集和Oxford Visual Geometry Group(VGG)数据集上进行了广泛实验，结果表明提出的SCR方法在召回和mAP方面超越了最先进的方法，为SGG任务提供了更稳健和无偏的解决方案。",
