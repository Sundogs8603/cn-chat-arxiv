    "abstract": "Objective: Gaussian Processes (GP)-based filters, which have been effectively used for various applications including electrocardiogram (ECG) filtering can be computationally demanding and the choice of their hyperparameters is typically ad hoc. Methods: We develop a data-driven GP filter to address both issues, using the notion of the ECG phase domain -- a time-warped representation of the ECG beats onto a fixed number of samples and aligned R-peaks, which is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Under this assumption, the computation of the sample mean and covariance matrix is simplified, enabling an efficient implementation of the GP filter in a data-driven manner, with no ad hoc hyperparameters. The proposed filter is evaluated and compared with a state-of-the-art wavelet-based filter, on the PhysioNet QT Database. The performance is evaluated by measuring the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement of the filter at SNR levels ranging from -5 to 30dB, in 5dB steps, using addit",

    "translated_abstract": "目标: 基于高斯过程（GP）的滤波器在各种应用中已经有效地用于心电图（ECG）滤波，但是计算复杂度较高，而且其超参数的选择通常是主观的。方法: 我们开发了一种基于数据驱动的GP滤波器来解决这两个问题，使用ECG相位域的概念，该域是将ECG节拍变形到固定数量的样本和对齐的R峰上，假设其符合高斯分布。在这个假设下，样本均值和协方差矩阵的计算变得简化，可以在数据驱动的方式下高效地实现GP滤波器，而不需要主观超参数。我们在PhysioNet QT数据库上评估了所提出的滤波器，并将其与最先进的小波滤波器进行了比较。通过测量滤波器在信噪比（SNR）为-5至30 dB范围内（每隔5 dB）的提升来评估其性能。",
