    "translated_abstract": "生成对抗网络（GAN）通过优化生成器和判别器的最小最大目标函数来学习目标概率分布。本文解决了这样一个问题：优化是否真正提供了使生成器分布接近目标分布的梯度。我们通过将GAN的形式与切片最优输运的概念结合起来，推导了可测性条件，即判别器作为分布之间的距离的充分条件。此外，通过利用这些理论结果，我们提出了一种新的GAN训练方案，称为切片对抗网络（SAN）。通过简单的修改，可以将广泛类别的现有GAN转化为SAN。在合成和图像数据集上的实验证实了我们的理论结果和SAN相对于普通GAN的有效性。此外，我们还将SAN应用于StyleGAN-XL，在分类上取得了GAN中最先进的FID（Frechet Inception Distance）评分。",
