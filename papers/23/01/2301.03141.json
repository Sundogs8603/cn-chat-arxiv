    "abstract": "We studied the capability of automated machine translation in the online video education space by automatically translating Khan Academy videos with state-of-the-art translation models and applying text-to-speech synthesis and audio/video synchronization to build engaging videos in target languages. We also analyzed and established two reliable translation confidence estimators based on round-trip translations in order to efficiently manage translation quality and reduce human translation effort. Finally, we developed a deployable system to deliver translated videos to end users and collect user corrections for iterative improvement.",
