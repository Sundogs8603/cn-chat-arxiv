    "translated_abstract": "过去对于四星系统的动力学稳定性问题通常被视为涉及到构成四星的两个“嵌套”三元组的问题。在这项新颖的研究中，我们采用了一种机器学习算法——多层感知器（MLP），根据其稳定性（或长期有界性）直接对2+2和3+1的四星组合进行分类。分类的训练数据集分别由$5\\times10^5$个四星组合进行模拟，模拟采用了高精度的直接$N$-body代码MSTAR。我们还进行了有限的参数空间研究，将四星组合和三元组直接进行比较。我们发现，我们的四星MLP模型比“嵌套”三元组MLP方法表现更好，对于3+1的四星组合尤为显著。2+2 MLP模型和3+1 MLP模型的分类准确率分别为94%和93%，而“嵌套”三元组方法的准确率分别为88%和66%。这对于四星系统有着重要的意义。",
