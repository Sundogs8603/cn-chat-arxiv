    "abstract": "We provide a critique of mathematical biology in light of rapid developments in modern machine learning. We argue that out of the three modelling activities -- (1) formulating models; (2) analysing models; and (3) fitting or comparing models to data -- inherent to mathematical biology, researchers currently focus too much on activity (2) at the cost of (1). This trend, we propose, can be reversed by realising that any given biological phenomena can be modelled in an infinite number of different ways, through the adoption of an open/pluralistic approach. We explain the open approach using fish locomotion as a case study and illustrate some of the pitfalls -- universalism, creating models of models, etc. -- that hinder mathematical biology. We then ask how we might rediscover a lost art: that of creative mathematical modelling.  This article is dedicated to the memory of Edmund Crampin.",

    "translated_abstract": "针对现代机器学习的快速发展，我们对数学生物学提出了批评。我们认为，在数学生物学中的三个模型建立活动——（1）制定模型，（2）分析模型，（3）将模型拟合或与数据进行比较——研究人员目前过度专注于活动（2），从而疏忽了活动（1）。我们建议通过采取开放/多元化的方法来逆转这一趋势，从而对任何给定的生物现象进行无限次建模。我们以鱼类运动作为案例研究，解释了开放方法，并阐述了阻碍数学生物学的一些陷阱（普遍主义、模型的模型等）。最后，我们探讨了如何重新发现一种失落的艺术：创造性的数学建模。本文献给Edmund Crampin的记忆。",
