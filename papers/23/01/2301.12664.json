    "translated_abstract": "深度模型在解决偏微分方程（PDEs）方面取得了令人瞩目的进展。一种新兴的范例是学习神经算子来近似PDEs的输入输出映射。虽然以前的深度模型已经探索了多尺度的体系结构和各种算子设计，但它们仅限于在坐标空间中整体学习算子。在实际物理科学问题中，PDEs是具有复杂耦合方程的，数值求解器依赖于高维坐标空间的离散化，这不能被单个算子准确地近似，也不能由于维度诅咒而有效地学习。本文提出了一种基于隐变量谱模型（LSM）的高维PDEs高效精确求解器。LSM不仅超出了坐标空间，而且还利用基于注意力的分层投影网络将高维数据在线性时间内缩小到一个紧凑的潜空间。受数值分析中经典的谱方法的启示，LSM利用谱方法在潜空间中学习算子，可以捕捉复杂的非线性交互并有效地解决维度诅咒。我们在多个高维PDEs上展示了LSM的有效性和可扩展性，如Navier-Stokes方程和Schrödinger方程。",
