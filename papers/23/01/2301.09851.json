    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络在图形任务中表现出强大的能力。然而，许多真实世界的图形是异构的，这挑战了经典图神经网络的同质性假设。为了解决这个普适性问题，许多研究加深网络或连接中间表示，但这并不会本质上改变邻居聚合并引入噪声。最近的研究提出了新的指标来表征同质性，但很少考虑所提出指标和模型之间的相关性。本文首先设计了一种新的指标 Neighborhood Homophily (NH)，用于测量节点邻域中的标签复杂度或纯度。此外，我们将该指标融入到经典的图卷积网络 (GCN) 结构中，提出了 NHGCN 模型。在该框架中，邻居被预估的 NH 值分组，从不同通道进行聚合。多项基准数据集上的实验证明，NHGCN 在节点分类和图分类任务中始终优于最先进的模型。",
