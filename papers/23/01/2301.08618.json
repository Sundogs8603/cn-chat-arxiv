    "translated_abstract": "针对含非测量源项的非齐次偏微分方程（PDEs）在软传感建模中难以很好解决的问题，本文提出了一种带循环预测（RP）学习策略的耦合物理信息神经网络（CPINN）来进行软传感建模。首先，提出了包含NetU和NetG的CPINN，其中NetU用于近似研究PDEs的解，NetG用于正则化NetU的训练，两个网络被集成到一个数据-物理混合损失函数中。随后，在理论上证明了所提出的CPINN具有满足PDEs解的近似容量。此外，我们提出了一种分层训练策略来优化和耦合两个网络以实现CPINN的参数。其次，通过在NetU中引入循环机制来进行未来状态的预测，提出了NetU-RP，以提高软传感建模在时空工业系统中的性能表现。最后，通过模拟振动位移系统的例子，演示了所提出的CPINN-RP方法在求解含非测量源项的PDEs和软传感建模应用中的有效性。",
