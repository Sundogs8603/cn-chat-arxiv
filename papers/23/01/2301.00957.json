    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了可解释的元神经常微分方程（iMODE）方法，用于快速学习可泛化（即不特定于参数）的多个动态系统的动力学，这些系统在其物理参数上有所变化。iMODE方法通过采用双层优化框架来学习元知识，即动力系统实例的力场的功能变化，而不知道物理参数：外层捕捉研究的动力系统实例之间的共同力场形式，内层则适应各个系统实例。先验的物理知识可以方便地嵌入到神经网络架构中作为归纳偏差，例如保守力场和欧几里得对称性。通过学习到的元知识，iMODE可以在几秒钟内对未知系统进行建模，并反向揭示关于系统物理参数的知识，或作为“测量”未知系统物理参数的神经量规。",

    "en_tdlr": "The interpretable meta neural ordinary differential equation (iMODE) method is proposed to rapidly learn generalizable dynamics from trajectories of multiple dynamical systems that vary in their physical parameters. It can accurately model and predict dynamic systems with different physical parameters by learning from trajectories, and it can also inversely infer the physical parameters of a system."
