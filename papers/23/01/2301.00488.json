    "translated_abstract": "信息传输速率（ITR）或有效比特率是一种流行而广泛使用的信息度量标准，特别是在基于SSVEP的脑机接口（BCI）中流行。通过将速度和准确性结合为单一值参数，该指标有助于评估和比较不同BCI社区中的各种目标识别算法。为了计算ITR，通常假定输入分布是一致的，并且信道模型过于简单，是无记忆的、平稳的、对称的，并具有离散的字母表大小。为了准确地描述性能并激发面向未来的BCI设计的端到端设计，因此需要更全面地审查和定义ITR。我们将寄宿于视网膜神经交叉处的共生通信媒介建模为离散无记忆信道，并使用修改后的容量表达式重新定义ITR。我们利用有向图的结果来表征通道的可达性和通信容量。",
