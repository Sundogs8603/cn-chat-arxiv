    "translated_abstract": "目前大多数先进的天气和气候模型都是基于物理信息的数值模型。这些方法旨在模拟非线性动力学和多变量之间的复杂相互作用，这些相互作用很难近似。此外，许多这样的数值模型在模拟细粒度空间和时间分辨率的大气现象时计算量很大。最近的基于机器学习的数据驱动方法通过使用深度神经网络学习数据驱动的功能映射来直接解决下游预测或投射任务。然而，这些网络是使用为特定时空任务策划和同质化的气候数据集进行训练的，因此缺乏数值模型的普遍性。我们开发并演示了ClimaX，这是一个灵活且可推广的深度学习模型，可用于天气和气候科学，并可以使用跨越不同数据集的异构数据进行训练。",
