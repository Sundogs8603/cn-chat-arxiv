    "translated_abstract": "如果$A$和$B$是这样的集合，即$A \\subset B$，那么一般化可以被理解为从$A$推断出一个足以构建$B$的假设。可以从$A$推断出任意数量的假设，但只有其中的一些可以推广到$B$。怎样知道哪些假设可能推广？一种策略是选择最短的，将压缩信息的能力与推广的能力（智能的代理）等同起来。我们在主动认知的数学形式主义背景下研究了这一点。我们证明了，压缩既不是最大化表现（用假设推广的概率衡量）的必要条件，也不是充分条件。我们制定了一个与长度或简单性无关的代理，称为弱点。我们表明，如果任务是均匀分布的，则不存在任何代理的选择，可以在所有任务中至少与弱点最大化的表现相同，同时在至少一个任务中表现更好。在比较最大弱点和最小描述长度(MDL)的实验中，我们发现最大弱点在各种任务上表现优于MDL。我们认为弱点是比长度或简单性更好的推广表现代理。",
