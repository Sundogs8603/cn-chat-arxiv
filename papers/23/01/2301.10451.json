    "translated_abstract": "不良药物事件（ADEs）是药物安全的重要方面。各种文本，如生物医学文献、药物评论、社交媒体和医疗论坛上的用户帖子，包含大量关于ADEs的信息。近期的研究应用了基于词嵌入和深度学习的自然语言处理技术来自动化从文本中检测ADEs。然而，它们未探讨如何将药物和不良反应的显式医学知识或相应的特征学习纳入到其中。本文采用描述文档、单词和概念之间关系的异质文本图，并通过统一医学语言系统中的医学知识增强它，提出了一个概念感知注意力机制，该机制为图中不同类型的节点不同地学习特征。我们还利用了预训练语言模型的上下文化嵌入和卷积图神经网络，以进行有效的特征学习。",
