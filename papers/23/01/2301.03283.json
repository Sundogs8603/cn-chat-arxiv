    "translated_abstract": "在多标记学习中，模型透明性、标签相关性学习和对标签噪声的鲁棒性非常重要。然而，目前很少有方法同时研究这三个特点。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种鲁棒的多标记Takagi-Sugeno-Kang模糊系统（R-MLTSK-FS），其中包括三种机制。首先，我们设计了一个软标签学习机制，通过明确测量标签之间的交互作用来减少标签噪声的影响，这也是其他两种机制的基础。其次，我们使用基于规则的TSK FS作为基模型，以比许多现有的多标记模型更透明的方式有效地建模特征和软标签之间的推理关系。第三，为了进一步提高多标记学习的性能，我们基于软标签空间和模糊特征空间构建了一个相关增强学习机制。我们进行了大量实验证明了所提方法的优越性。",
