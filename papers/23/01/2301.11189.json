    "translated_abstract": "有损图像压缩旨在在尽可能少的比特数下保持对原始图像的保真度。理论结果表明，优化失真度量（如PSNR或MS-SSIM）必然导致原始图像与重建图像的统计信息存在差异，特别是在低比特率下，这常常表现为压缩图像的模糊。先前的工作利用对抗性鉴别器提高了统计保真度。然而，从生成建模任务中采用的这些二元鉴别器可能不适用于图像压缩。在本文中，我们引入了一种非二元的鉴别器，它以通过VQ-VAE自动编码器获得的量化局部图像表示为条件。我们在CLIC2020、DIV2K和Kodak数据集上的评估表明，与目前最先进的HiFiC模型的PatchGAN相比，我们的鉴别器更有效地联合优化失真度（例如PSNR）和统计保真度（例如FID）。",
