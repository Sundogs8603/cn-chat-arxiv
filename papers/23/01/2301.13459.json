    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度度量学习技术受到关注，因为学习到的距离表示可用于捕捉样本之间的相似性关系，并进一步提高各种监督或无监督学习任务的性能。我们提出了一种新的监督度量学习方法，可学习几何和概率空间中的距离度量，用于图像识别。与先前的度量学习方法通常侧重于学习欧几里德空间中的距离度量不同，我们提出的方法能够以混合方法学习更好的距离表示。为了实现这一点，我们提出了广义混合度量损失（GHM-Loss）来通过控制几何近邻和概率近邻之间的权衡从图像数据中学习通用的混合相似特征。为了评估我们方法的有效性，我们首先提供了所提出的损失函数的理论推导和证明，然后在几个基准数据集上进行实验，结果表明我们提出的方法优于这些数据集上的现有最先进方法。",

The proposed Generalized Hybrid Metric Loss (GHM-Loss) is used to learn the general hybrid proximity features from the image data. Results of experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets."
