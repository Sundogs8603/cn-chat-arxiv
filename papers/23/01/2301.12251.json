    "translated_abstract": "局部搜索方法是解决大规模组合优化问题的一种有效方法，并且通过几种微妙的机制在最近几年取得了显著的进展。本文在解决伪布尔优化（PBO）的局部搜索算法中发现了两种改进方法：首先，一些机制如单元传播仅仅用于解决MaxSAT问题，但同样可以推广到解决PBO问题；其次，现有的局部搜索算法利用变量的启发式评分来引导搜索。我们试图对从变量到给定公式之间建立桥梁的子句进行更深入的研究，因为子句在其中起到了中间人的作用。因此，我们首先将基于单元传播的减少算法扩展到PBO问题中，为PBO问题给出了更进一步的广义定义，并将其应用于现有的求解器LS-PBO以构建初始分配；然后，我们介绍了一种基于特征学习的子句权重计算方法。",
