    "translated_abstract": "许多实验时间序列测量共享未被观察到的因果驱动器。例如，受转录因子靶向的基因、受大尺度大气环流影响的海洋流动，以及被下降神经元控制的电机电路。可靠地推断这种看不见的驱动力是必要的，以了解不同生物和工程系统中自上而下控制方案的间歇性本质。在这里，我们介绍了一种新的无监督学习算法，该算法使用时间序列测量中的复现逐渐重构未被观察到的驱动信号。借助于斜积动力系统的数学理论，我们确定了响应时间序列间共享的复现事件，这些事件隐含地定义了一个具有玻璃状结构的复现图。随着观察到的数据量或质量的改善，该复现图经历了一个渗流转变，表现为随机行走在诱导的景观上出现微弱的遍历性破裂 - 暴露出共享驱动信号作为少数参数的函数。我们在几个合成示例中展示了算法的性能。最后，我们将我们的方法应用于现实生态数据集，并确定了厄尔尼诺、季节性鱼类迁移和果蝇种群动态的驱动因素。",
