    "translated_abstract": "在人工智能领域，了解和建模数据生成过程（DGP）的追求至关重要。深度生成模型（DGM）在捕捉复杂数据分布方面表现出色，但通常在泛化能力和可解释性方面表现不足。而因果性则提供了一种结构化的方法来理解驱动数据生成的机制，并突显了这些过程中固有的因果效应动力学。虽然因果性在可解释性和外推能力方面表现出色，但却面临着高维空间中的复杂性。意识到它们之间的协同潜力，我们深入探讨了因果性和DGM的交汇点。我们阐明了因果性原则在DGM中的整合，探讨了使用DGM进行因果识别的方法，并对因果性在大规模生成模型中的新兴研究前沿，尤其是大型语言模型（LLM）中的生成性问题提供了见解。我们介绍了方法论，突出了开放的挑战和机会。",
