    "abstract": "Recently, inversion methods have focused on additional high-rate information in the generator (e.g., weights or intermediate features) to refine inversion and editing results from embedded latent codes. Although these techniques gain reasonable improvement in reconstruction, they decrease editing capability, especially on complex images (e.g., containing occlusions, detailed backgrounds, and artifacts). A vital crux is refining inversion results, avoiding editing capability degradation. To tackle this problem, we introduce Domain-Specific Hybrid Refinement (DHR), which draws on the advantages and disadvantages of two mainstream refinement techniques to maintain editing ability with fidelity improvement. Specifically, we first propose Domain-Specific Segmentation to segment images into two parts: in-domain and out-of-domain parts. The refinement process aims to maintain the editability for in-domain areas and improve two domains' fidelity. We refine these two parts by weight modulation ",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，反演方法关注生成器中的额外高比率信息（例如，权重或中间特征），以优化从嵌入式潜在代码进行反演和编辑的结果。虽然这些技术在重建方面取得了合理的改进，但它们会减弱编辑能力，尤其是在复杂图像（例如包含遮挡，详细背景和伪影的图像）上。关键在于精细化反演结果，避免编辑能力降级。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了面向特定领域的混合细化（DHR），利用了两种主流细化技术的优点和缺点，以保持编辑能力和保证保真度的提高。具体来说，我们首先提出了面向特定领域的分割方法，将图像分成两个部分：域内和域外部分。细化过程旨在保持域内区域的可编辑性并提高两个域的保真度。我们通过权重调节来细化这两个部分。",
