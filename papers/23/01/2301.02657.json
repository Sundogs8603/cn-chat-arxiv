    "translated_abstract": "视频分割领域目前被划分为不同的任务，涵盖了多个基准。尽管最先进技术正在快速发展，但是当前方法主要是针对特定任务的，这些方法不能概念上推广到其他任务。受到具有多任务能力的最近方法的启发，我们提出了TarViS：一种新颖的统一网络架构，可应用于需要在视频中分段任意定义的“目标”集的任何任务。我们的方法在任务定义这些目标的方式方面具有灵活性，因为它将后者建模为抽象的“查询”，然后用于预测像素精确的目标掩码。单个TarViS模型可以联合训练跨越不同任务的数据集集合，并且可以在推断期间在任务之间进行热切换，无需任何特定于任务的重新训练。为了证明其有效性，我们将TarViS应用于四个不同的任务，即视频实例分割(VIS)、视频全景分割(VPS)、视频语义分割和视频目标分割(VOS)。实验结果表明，TarViS在所有任务中均优于现有最先进方法。",
