    "translated_abstract": "尽管目标驱动导航有些成功应用，但现有的基于深度强化学习(DRL)的方法在数据效率方面存在明显问题。其中一个原因是目标信息与感知模块解耦，并直接作为决策的条件引入，导致场景表示中与目标无关的特征在学习过程中起到对抗作用。鉴于此，我们提出了一种新颖的目标引导变压器增强学习(GTRL)方法，通过将物理目标状态作为场景编码器的输入来指导场景表示与目标信息的耦合，并实现高效的自主导航。具体而言，我们提出了一种新的视觉变压器变体作为感知系统的骨干，即目标引导变压器(GoT)，并使用专家先验进行预训练，以提高数据效率。随后，我们设计了一个增强学习算法进行导航决策。",
