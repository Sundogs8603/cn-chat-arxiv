    "translated_abstract": "癌症基因的识别是癌症基因组学研究中一个关键而具有挑战性的问题。现有的计算方法，包括深度图神经网络，未能利用多层基因-基因交互或提供有限的预测解释。这些方法仅限于单一生物网络，无法捕获肿瘤发生的完整复杂性。在不同的生物网络上训练的模型往往会产生不同甚至相反的癌症基因预测，阻碍了它们可信的应用。在这里，我们引入了一种可解释的多层图神经网络（EMGNN）方法，通过利用多个基因-基因交互网络和全癌症多组学数据来识别癌症基因。与传统的在单一生物网络上进行图学习不同，EMGNN 使用多层图神经网络从多个生物网络中学习以实现准确的癌症基因预测。我们的方法始终优于所有现有方法，",
