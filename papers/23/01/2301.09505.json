    "translated_abstract": "设计具有表达能力的图神经网络(GNNs)是学习图结构数据的一个核心主题。尽管已经提出了很多方法来改进GNNs在Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL)测试方面的表现，但是普遍还存在对它们能够系统和可证明地获得的额外能力的缺乏深入了解。本文从根本上不同的角度来研究GNNs的表达能力，超越了WL测试。具体地，我们引入了一类新的通过图的双连通性的表达度量，并强调它们在理论和实践中的重要性。由于双连通性可以使用简单的算法进行计算，并且具有线性的计算成本，因此很自然地可以期望流行的GNNs也可以很容易地进行学习。然而，经过对以前的GNN架构的彻底审查，我们惊讶地发现大多数架构对于任何这些度量都不具有表达能力。唯一的例外是ESAN框架，对于该框架，我们给出了一个理论的解释。",
