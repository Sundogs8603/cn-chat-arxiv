    "translated_abstract": "对于移动众包系统，招募可信和高质量的工作者是一个重要的研究问题。先前的研究要么假设工作者的能力是事先已知的，要么假设平台一旦接收到他们收集的数据就知道他们的能力。实际上，为了降低成本并最大程度地提高收入，许多有策略的工作者不诚实地执行其感知任务，并向平台报告虚假数据，这被称为虚假数据攻击。对于平台来说，评估所收到的数据的真实性十分困难。本文提出了一种名为基于半监督组合多臂赌博反向拍卖（SCMABA）的激励机制来解决MCS中多个未知和有策略的工作者的招聘问题。首先，我们将工作者招募建模为多臂赌博反向拍卖问题，并设计了一种基于UCB的算法来分离探索和开发，将已招募的工作者的感知率视为“臂“。",
