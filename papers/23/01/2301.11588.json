    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的多目标贝叶斯优化（MOBO）方法，用于在输入不确定性（IU）存在的情况下高效地识别由风险衡量定义的帕累托前沿（PF）。现有的IU下帕累托优化的BO方法是特定风险或者没有理论保证的，而我们提出的方法涉及一般风险衡量并具有理论保证。所提方法的基本思想是假设黑箱函数的高斯过程（GP）模型，并使用GP模型构建风险衡量的高概率边界框。此外，为了减少非支配边界框的不确定性，我们提出了一种使用基于边界框的拟距离的最大值定义的最大最小距离选择下一个评估点的方法。作为理论分析，我们证明了该算法可以在有限次迭代中返回任意精确的解。",
