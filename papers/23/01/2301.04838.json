    "translated_abstract": "时间序列分类是一项重要的数据挖掘任务，在过去的20年里引起了很多关注。由于实际中标签稀缺，只有少量标记样本的半监督时间序列分类变得流行。最近，提出了相似性感知时间序列分类（SimTSC）来解决这个问题，该方法使用基于批量数据的两两动态时间规整（DTW）距离生成的图神经网络分类模型。SimTSC表现出优秀的准确度，并在几个少标签设置中胜过了最先进的深度学习模型。然而，由于SimTSC依赖于两两DTW距离，DTW的二次复杂性限制了它只能在适度大小的数据集上使用。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种新的高效半监督时间序列分类技术LB-SimTSC，其中包括一个新的图构建模块。我们提出使用DTW的下界LB_Keogh来近似DTW。",
