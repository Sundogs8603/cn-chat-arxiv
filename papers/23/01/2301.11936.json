    "translated_abstract": "量子机器学习(QML)领域中的一个重要挑战是建立量子计算在加速神经网络等常见机器学习任务中的应用。小波变换一直是神经网络理论研究中的基本数学工具，但由于传统经典计算的数值实现需要指数级运行时间$\\exp(O(D))$，因此小波变换的实际应用性受到限制，尤其在数据维度$D$增加时。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了量子小波变换(QRT)，它在量子计算的线性运行时间$O(D)$内实现了对量子态的小波变换。作为一个应用，我们还展示了利用QRT作为QML的基本子程序，可以高效地找到大型浅宽神经网络的稀疏可训练子网络，而无需对原始网络进行大规模优化。",
