    "translated_abstract": "教育是每个人的权利，然而，每个个体都与其他人不同。在后共产主义时代，教师发现固有的个人主义以同样的方式培训所有人朝向第四次工业革命的工作市场。我们可以考虑学术实践中的少数民族教育场景。少数民族群体在自己的文化中成长，并希望用自己的方式教授。我们将这种语言人类学（人们如何学习）为基础的参与形式建立为半监督问题。然后，我们开发了一种条件深度生成对抗网络算法，即LA-GAN，用于分类学生参与中的语言民族志特征。理论上的证明证实了我们的半监督对抗模型的客观性、正则化和损失函数。准备了调查问题，以了解z代和少数族群的一些假设，包括他们的学习风格、学习方法",
