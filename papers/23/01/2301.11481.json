    "abstract": "Recently, remarkable progress has been made by approximating Nash equilibrium (NE), correlated equilibrium (CE), and coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) through function approximation that trains a neural network to predict equilibria from game representations. Furthermore, equivariant architectures are widely adopted in designing such equilibrium approximators in normal-form games. In this paper, we theoretically characterize benefits and limitations of equivariant equilibrium approximators. For the benefits, we show that they enjoy better generalizability than general ones and can achieve better approximations when the payoff distribution is permutation-invariant. For the limitations, we discuss their drawbacks in terms of equilibrium selection and social welfare. Together, our results help to understand the role of equivariance in equilibrium approximators.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，通过使用神经网络训练函数逼近纳什均衡（NE）、相关均衡（CE）和粗略相关均衡（CCE），取得了显著的进展。此外，在正态博弈中设计这种均衡逼近器通常采用等变体系结构。本文从理论上刻画了等变均衡逼近器的优缺点，并得出以下结论：在一些情况下等变均衡逼近器比普通均衡逼近器具有更好的泛化性能，并且当收益分布是置换不变的时，等变均衡逼近器可以实现更好的逼近效果；然而，等变均衡逼近器在均衡选择和社会福利方面存在缺陷。这些结果有助于理解等变性在均衡逼近器中的作用。",
