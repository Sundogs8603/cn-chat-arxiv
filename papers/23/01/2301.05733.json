The choice model is indexed by a scalar parameter $\\theta$, whereas the distribution of unit-specific heterogeneity, as well as the feedback process that maps lagged outcomes into future covariate realizations, are left unrestricted. We provide a simple condition under which $\\theta$ is never point-identified, no matter the number of time periods available. This condition is satisfied in most models, including the logit one. We also characterize the identified set of $\\theta$ and show how to compute it using linear programming techniques. While $\\theta$ is not generally point-identified, its identified set is informative in the examples we analyze numerically, suggesting that meaningful learning about $\\theta$ may be possible even in short panels with feedback.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个带有单一预定二元协变量（即在滞后结果和协变量条件下按顺序外生的协变量）的二元选择面板数据模型的识别问题。选择模型由一个标量参数θ索引，而单位特定异质性的分布以及将滞后结果映射到未来协变量实现的反馈过程是不受限制的。我们提供了一个简单的条件，无论可用的时间段有多少，θ都无法被点识别。这个条件在大多数模型中都成立，包括logit模型。我们还表征了θ的识别集，并展示了如何使用线性规划技术计算它。虽然θ通常无法点识别，但在我们数值分析的示例中，它的识别集是有信息的，这表明即使在有反馈的短期面板中，关于θ的有意义的学习可能是可能的。作为补充，我们报告了一组经验结果，进一步证明了我们的发现。",
