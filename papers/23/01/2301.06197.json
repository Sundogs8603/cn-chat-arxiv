    "translated_abstract": "自动化的AI分类器应该能够推迟预测，让人类决策者做出决策来确保更准确的预测。在这项工作中，我们联合训练一个分类器和一个拒绝器，拒绝器会在每个数据点上决定分类器或人类应该进行预测。我们展示了先前的方法可能无法找到一个具有低误差的人工智能系统和人类，即使存在具有零误差的线性分类器和拒绝器（可实现的设置）。我们证明，即使问题可实现，获得低误差的线性组合也是NP难问题。为了补充这一负面结果，我们提供了一个混合整数线性规划（MILP）公式，可以在线性设置下最优地解决该问题。然而，MILP只适用于中等规模的问题。因此，我们提供了一种新的替代损失函数，它是可实现一致的，并在实践中表现良好。我们在一组全面的数据集上测试了我们的方法，并与广泛的基准进行了比较。",
