    "abstract": "Gender inclusivity in language technologies has become a prominent research topic. In this study, we explore gender-neutral translation (GNT) as a form of gender inclusivity and a goal to be achieved by machine translation (MT) models, which have been found to perpetuate gender bias and discrimination. Specifically, we focus on translation from English into Italian, a language pair representative of salient gender-related linguistic transfer problems. To define GNT, we review a selection of relevant institutional guidelines for gender-inclusive language, discuss its scenarios of use, and examine the technical challenges of performing GNT in MT, concluding with a discussion of potential solutions to encourage advancements toward greater inclusivity in MT.",

    "translated_abstract": "语言技术中的性别包容性已成为一个重要的研究课题。本研究探讨性别中性化翻译（GNT）作为一种性别包容性和机器翻译（MT）模型所要实现的目标，这些模型被发现具有延续性别偏见和歧视的倾向。具体而言，我们关注英译意这对语言，它代表了突出的与性别有关的语言转移问题。为了定义GNT，我们回顾了一些相关的机构性别包容性语言指南，讨论了使用GNT的情景，并探讨了在MT中执行GNT的技术挑战，最后讨论了潜在的解决方案，以鼓励朝着更大的包容性发展。",
