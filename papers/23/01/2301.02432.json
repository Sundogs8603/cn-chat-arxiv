We gathered these myths from conversations at conferences and meetings, product advertisements, papers, and other communications such as tweets, blogs, and news articles within and beyond our community. We believe they represent the zeitgeist of the current era of massive change, driven by the end of many scaling laws such as Dennard scaling and Moore's law. While some laws end, new directions are emerging, such as algorithmic scaling or novel architecture research.

In fact, we believe that this is the very reason for the existence of many myths and why they cannot be answered clearly. While it feels like there should be clear answers for each, some may remain endless philosophical debates, such as whether Beethoven was better than",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇发人深省的文章中，我们讨论了高性能计算社区成员间流传的一些神话和传说。我们从会议和会议上的对话、产品广告、论文以及社区内外的推特、博客和新闻文章中收集了这些神话。我们认为它们代表了当前时代的时代精神，这个时代正在经历许多规模定律的终结，如Dennard定律和摩尔定律。虽然一些定律结束了，但新的方向正在出现，比如算法的规模化或新的架构研究。然而，这些神话很少基于科学事实，而是基于一些证据或论证。事实上，我们认为这正是许多神话存在的原因，也是为什么它们无法得到明确答案的原因。虽然每个神话都应该有明确的答案，但有些问题可能仍然是无休止的哲学辩论，比如贝多芬比谁更好。",
