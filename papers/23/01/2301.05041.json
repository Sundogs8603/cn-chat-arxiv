    "translated_abstract": "为了深入了解一个动态系统，拥有一个可解释和多功能的模型是很方便的。定时离散事件系统就是这样一种模型，它们满足这些要求。然而，这种模型只能从时间戳事件序列推断出来，而不能直接从数字数据中推断出来。为了解决这个问题，必须进行离散化步骤，以识别时间序列中的事件或符号。Persist是一种离散化方法，旨在使用称为持久性分数的得分来创建持久性符号。这样可以减轻非期望符号变化的风险，从而导致模型过于复杂。经过对持久性分数的研究，我们发现它往往偏向于过度的情况，从而错过了有趣的持久性符号。为了纠正这种行为，我们用Wasserstein距离替换了持久性分数中使用的指标，即Kullback-Leibler分歧。实验表明，改进后的持久性分数增强了Persist的性能。",
