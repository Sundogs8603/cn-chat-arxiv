    "translated_abstract": "人类睡眠呈周期性，大约90分钟一周期，这意味着睡眠数据中存在长期的时间依赖性。然而，在开发睡眠分期模型时，探索这种长期依赖性一直未被触及。在这项工作中，我们表明，编码整个睡眠周期的逻辑对于改进睡眠分期性能至关重要，然而，现有的最先进的深度学习模型中的顺序建模方法对此目的来说是低效的。因此，我们引入了一种高效的长序列建模方法，并提出了一种新的深度学习模型L-SeqSleepNet，该模型考虑了整个周期的睡眠信息进行睡眠分期。通过对四个不同大小的数据库进行评估，我们展示了该模型在三种不同的脑电图设置下，包括传统多导睡眠监测（PSG）中的头皮脑电图、耳内脑电图和耳后脑电图（cEEGrid），即使只有一个脑电通道输入，也能取得最先进的性能。我们的分析还表明，使用L-SeqSleepNet进行整个周期建模能够提高睡眠分期的效果。",
