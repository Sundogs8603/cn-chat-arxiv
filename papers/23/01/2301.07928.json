Hereby, the symplectic system structure is preserved despite the data-driven modeling approach. However, preserving symmetries requires additional attention. In this research, we enhance HNN with a Lie algebra framework to detect and embed symmetries in the neural network. This approach allows to simultaneously learn the symmetry group action and the total energy of the system. As illustrating examples, a pendulum on a cart and a two-body problem from astrodynamics are considered.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，引入了哈密顿神经网络（HNN），以在学习哈密顿系统的动力学方程时纳入先前的物理知识。通过这种数据驱动的建模方法，保留了辛系统结构。然而，保留对称性需要额外关注。在这项研究中，我们用李代数框架增强了HNN，以检测和嵌入神经网络中的对称性。该方法允许同时学习对称性群的作用和系统的总能量。以摆在小车上和天体动力学中的二体问题为例说明了这种方法的有效性。",
