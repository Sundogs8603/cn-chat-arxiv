    "translated_abstract": "实现准确的配电系统状态估计（DSSE）面临着许多挑战，其中包括可观测性不足和配电系统密度高。虽然基于机器学习模型的数据驱动替代方案可能是一种选择，但由于缺乏标注数据，它们在DSSE中受到影响。实际上，配电系统中的测量往往是嘈杂、损坏和不可用的。为解决这些问题，我们提出了基于图神经网络（GNN）的深度学习模型——用于配电系统状态估计的深度统计求解器（DSS$^2$），它考虑到了配电系统的网络结构和物理控制功率流方程。DSS$^2$利用超图来表示配电系统的异构组件，并通过以节点为中心的消息传递方案更新其潜在表示。提出了一种弱监督学习方法，在不需要标记数据的情况下以学习优化的方式训练DSS$^2$。实验结果表明，DSS$^2$在实际数据集上提高了估计精度，优于现有方法。",
