    "translated_abstract": "数据收集的缺乏多样性导致机器学习应用中的严重失败。虽然机器学习开发人员可以进行数据后处理，但这需要耗费大量时间并很少全面。因此，需要新的方法来跟踪和管理数据收集、迭代和模型训练，以评估数据集是否反映了真实世界的变异。我们提出了设计数据的迭代方法，将人机交互概念与机器学习技术相结合。我们的过程包括（1）预收集计划，主动促使并记录预期的数据分布；（2）收集监控，系统性地鼓励采样多样性；（3）数据熟悉度，使用密度估计方法识别模型对其不熟悉的样本。我们将设计数据应用于数据收集和建模任务。我们发现在跨组交叉群体训练的模型上，“设计”数据集的泛化能力优于大小相似但针对性较低的数据集的模型。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文介绍了一种设计数据的迭代方法，将人机交互概念与机器学习技术相结合，以解决机器学习应用中数据收集缺乏多样性导致的失败问题。通过预收集计划、收集监控和数据熟悉度等步骤，该方法可以提高模型的泛化能力并在跨组交叉群体上取得更好的结果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents an iterative approach called designing data, which combines HCI concepts with machine learning techniques to address the failures caused by lack of diversity in data collection for machine learning applications. The method improves the model's generalization ability and achieves better results across intersectional groups by incorporating pre-collection planning, collection monitoring, and data familiarity steps."
