To achieve this, the model does not need to access any plaintext passwords from the target credentials.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了“通用密码模型”的概念——一种密码模型，一旦预训练，就可以根据目标系统自动更改其猜测策略。为了实现这一点，模型不需要访问任何目标凭证中的明文密码。相反，它利用用户的辅助信息（例如电子邮件地址）作为代理信号来预测潜在的密码分布。具体而言，模型利用深度学习来捕捉一组用户（例如Web应用程序的用户）的辅助数据与其密码之间的相关性。然后利用这些模式为目标系统创建一个定制的密码模型。这不需要进一步的训练步骤，针对性的数据收集，或社区密码分布的先前知识。除了改进当前密码强度评估技术和攻击之外，该模型还使任何终端用户（例如系统管理员）能够自主生成密码保护策略。",
