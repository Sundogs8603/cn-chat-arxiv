The setting is a standard binary model with transfers and quasi-linear utility. Agents report their preferences for the public good, which are randomly ``flipped,'' so that any individual report may be explained away as the outcome of noise. We study the tradeoffs between preserving the public decisions made in the presence of noise (noise sensitivity), pursuing efficiency, and mitigating the effect of noise on revenue.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在个体代理人报告的偏好经过噪声保护的情况下进行公共物品供应的机制设计。该模型是一个具有转移和拟线性效用的标准二进制模型。代理人报告他们对公共物品的偏好，这些偏好会被随机“翻转”，以便任何个体报告都可以被解释为噪声的结果。我们研究了在存在噪声的情况下保留公共决策（噪声敏感性），追求效率以及减轻噪声对收入的影响之间的平衡。",
