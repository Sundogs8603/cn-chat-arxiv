    "translated_abstract": "本文通过实证研究，探究了噪声调度策略对去噪扩散生成模型的影响。本研究得出了三个结论：（1）噪声调度对性能至关重要，最优的噪声调度策略取决于任务（例如图像大小）；（2）在图像大小增加时，最优噪声调度会朝更嘈杂的方向转移（由于像素冗余增加）；（3）仅通过将输入数据按比例$b$缩放并保持噪声调度函数不变（相当于将logSNR向上移动$\\log b$），便是一种适用于各种图像大小的良好策略。将这一简单方法与最近提出的递归接口网络（RIN）结合起来，能够在ImageNet上生成1024$\\times$1024分辨率的高保真度图像。这一方法能够以单步、端到端方式生成多样且高质量的图像。",

    "en_tdlr": "This empirical study highlights the importance of noise scheduling strategies for denoising diffusion generative models and finds that the optimal noise scheduling strategy varies depending on the task and shifts towards a noisier one with increased image size. Furthermore, scaling the input data and keeping the noise schedule fixed is an effective strategy across image sizes for generating high-quality images."
