Recent works have explored data-driven methods for learning convex objective functions, but learning their monotone gradients is seldom studied. In this work, we propose C-MGN and M-MGN, two monotone gradient neural network architectures for directly learning the gradients of convex functions. We show that, compared to state of the art methods, our networks are easier to train, learn monotone gradient fields more accurately, and use significantly fewer parameters. We further demonstrate their ability to learn optimal transport mappings to augment driving image data.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管已经付出了大量的努力来推导和分析信号处理问题的有效凸函数形式，但凸函数的梯度也具有重要的应用，从基于梯度的优化到最优运输等。最近的研究探索了数据驱动的方法来学习凸目标函数，但很少研究学习它们单调梯度的方法。在本文中，我们提出了两种单调梯度神经网络结构 C-MGN 和 M-MGN，用于直接学习凸函数的梯度。我们发现，与现有的方法相比，我们的网络容易训练，获得了更准确的单调梯度场，并使用了更少的参数。我们进一步展示了它们学习最优运输映射以增强驱动图像数据的能力。",
