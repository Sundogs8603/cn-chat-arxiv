    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个学习框架，用于对可交换数据进行损失控制预测的校准预测模型，扩展了我们最近提出的适用于更一般情况的符合损失控制预测。与之相比，通过提出的损失控制方法构建的预测器不限于集合预测器，并且损失函数可以是任何可测函数，而不需要单调性假设。为了以有效的方式控制损失值，我们引入保持交换性质的变换，以证明在获得测试标签时有有限样本控制保证，并然后发展出一种构建预测器的近似方法。这些变换可以建立在任何预定义的函数上，包括使用优化算法进行参数搜索。这种方法是符合损失控制预测的自然扩展，因为当集合预测器具有嵌套属性且损失函数为单调函数时，它可以化简为后者。",
