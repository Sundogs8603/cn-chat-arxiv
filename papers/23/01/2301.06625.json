This study will create a novel model to forecast Heart Rate (HR), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) in ICU.

We extracted $24,886$ ICU stays from the MIMIC-III database, which contains data from over $46$ thousand patients, to train and test the model. Methods: The model proposed in this study, areansformerin intensive careabilistic Model for Sparse Time Series Forecasting (TDSTF), uses a deep learning technique called the Transformer. The TDSTF model showed state-of-the-art performance in predicting vital signs in the ICU, outperforming other models' ability to predict distributions of vital signs and being more computationally efficient.
