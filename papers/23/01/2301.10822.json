    "translated_abstract": "最先进的预测维护技术在降低复杂机器的维护成本和停机时间，提高整体生产率方面已经取得了巨大成功，通过广泛利用物联网和深度学习。不幸的是，物联网传感器和深度学习算法都容易受到网络攻击的影响。例如，深度学习算法对对抗性示例的敏感性已经被公认。然而，在预测维护领域，对抗性攻击的研究相对较少。这是因为在计算机视觉领域用于分类任务的对抗性攻击不能直接应用于多变量时间序列回归任务的预测维护领域。本文提出了一种端到端的方法来设计对抗性鲁棒的预测维护系统，通过广泛分析不同类型的对抗性攻击的影响，并为基于深度学习的预测维护模型提出了一种新颖的对抗性防御技术。",
