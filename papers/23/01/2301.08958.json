In this second monograph, we discuss several topics in RD methodology that build on and extend the analysis of RD designs introduced in Cattaneo, Idrobo and Titiunik (2020). Our first goal is to present an alternative RD conceptual framework based on local randomization ideas. This methodological approach can be useful in RD designs with discretely-valued scores, and can also be used more broadly as a complement to the continuity-based approach in other settings. Then, employing both continuity-based and local randomization approaches, we extend the canonical Sharp RD design in multiple directions: fuzzy RD designs, RD designs with discrete score",
