The primary objective is to enhance the diagnostic process by generating more accurate representations of medical images, with a particular focus on patient-specific normal features and pathologies. A key distinction from previous models lies in its ability to produce enriched image descriptors solely from binary information, eliminating the need for costly and difficult to obtain tumor segmentation.
