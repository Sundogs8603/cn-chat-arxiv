    "translated_abstract": "本文重点研究性别分割劳动力市场如何影响国际贸易的本地效应。首先，我们构建一个理论框架，将贸易和性别分割的劳动力市场结合起来，以展示外部需求冲击可能增加或减少女性相对于男性的就业比率。关键的理论结果正式表明，贸易对性别分割劳动力市场的影响关键取决于（a）面对外国需求冲击的行业；以及（b）需求冲击来自的国外市场在国内的相关重要性。如果一个相关市场的外部需求冲击发生在一个女性密集（男性密集）的行业中，那么模型预测女性相对于男性的就业比率应该增加（下降）。然后，我们利用突尼斯本地劳动力市场暴露于外部需求冲击的可信外生变化，并展示实证结果与理论预测一致。在突尼斯这样一个国家，",

Empirical results in Tunisia confirm the theory."
