In this paper, we present Reef-Insight, an unsupervised machine learning framework that features advanced clustering methods and remote sensing for reef habitat mapping. Our framework compares different clustering methods for reef habitat mapping using remote sensing data. We evaluate four major clustering approaches based on qualitative and visual assessments which include k-means, hierarchical clustering, Gaussian mixture model, and density-based clustering.

    "translated_abstract": "环境损害一直是一个重大关注点，特别是在海岸区域和海洋中，考虑到气候变化和污染及极端气候事件的严重影响。我们目前的分析能力以及遥感等信息获取技术的进步，可以用于管理和研究珊瑚礁生态系统。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为Reef-Insight的无监督机器学习框架，它具有先进的聚类方法和遥感技术，用于珊瑚礁栖息地映射。我们的框架通过使用遥感数据比较不同的聚类方法进行珊瑚礁栖息地映射。我们评估了基于定性和视觉评估的四种主要聚类方法，包括k-means、层次聚类、高斯混合模型和密度聚类。我们利用了澳大利亚南大堡礁的One Tree Island珊瑚礁的遥感数据进行试验。我们的研究结果表明，通过遥感数据进行聚类方法可以有效进行珊瑚礁栖息地映射。",
