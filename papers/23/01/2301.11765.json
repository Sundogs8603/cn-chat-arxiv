    "abstract": "This paper presents ExplainableFold, an explainable AI framework for protein structure prediction. Despite the success of AI-based methods such as AlphaFold in this field, the underlying reasons for their predictions remain unclear due to the black-box nature of deep learning models. To address this, we propose a counterfactual learning framework inspired by biological principles to generate counterfactual explanations for protein structure prediction, enabling a dry-lab experimentation approach. Our experimental results demonstrate the ability of ExplainableFold to generate high-quality explanations for AlphaFold's predictions, providing near-experimental understanding of the effects of amino acids on 3D protein structure. This framework has the potential to facilitate a deeper understanding of protein structures.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了ExplainableFold，一种用于蛋白质结构预测的可解释AI框架。尽管像AlphaFold这样的基于AI的方法在该领域取得了成功，但由于深度学习模型的黑盒特性，其预测的基本原因仍不清楚。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一个受生物学原理启发的反事实学习框架，用于生成反事实解释，从而实现一个干实验的方法。我们的实验结果表明，ExplainableFold能够生成高质量的AlphaFold预测解释，提供接近实验的对氨基酸对3D蛋白质结构影响的理解。这一框架有潜力促进对蛋白质结构的更深入理解。",
