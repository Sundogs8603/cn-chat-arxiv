    "translated_abstract": "时空图神经网络（STGNN）已成为时空图（STG）预测的主要模型。然而，它们无法对STG数据中的内在不确定性进行建模，这使得它们在决策任务中的实用性受到限制。为此，本文关注概率STG预测，由于建模不确定性和复杂的ST依赖关系的困难，这是一个具有挑战性的问题。在本研究中，我们首次尝试将流行的去噪扩散概率模型推广到STG，提出了一种称为DiffSTG的新的非自回归框架，并在该框架中引入了第一个STG去噪网络UGnet。我们的方法将STGNN的时空学习能力与扩散模型的不确定性测量相结合。大量实验证实DiffSTG将持续排名概率分数（CRPS）降低了4%-14%，均方根误差（RMSE）降低了2%-7%。",
