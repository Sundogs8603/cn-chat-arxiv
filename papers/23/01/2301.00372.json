    "abstract": "An agent may strategically employ a vague message to mislead an audience's belief about the state of the world, but this may cause the agent to feel guilt or negatively impact how the audience perceives the agent. Using a novel experimental design that allows participants to be vague while at the same time isolating the internal cost of lying from the social identity cost of appearing dishonest, we explore the extent to which these two types of lying costs affect communication. We find that participants exploit vagueness to be consistent with the truth, while at the same time leveraging the imprecision to their own benefit. More participants use vague messages in treatments where concern with social identity is relevant. In addition, we find that social identity concerns substantially affect the length and patterns of vague messages used across the treatments.",

    "translated_abstract": "一个代理人可以有意使用含糊的信息来误导受众对世界状态的信念，但这可能导致代理人有罪感或对受众的看法产生负面影响。通过使用一种新颖的实验设计，使参与者可以模糊表达，同时将说谎的内部成本与出现不诚实的社会身份成本予以分离，我们探讨了这两类说谎成本对沟通的影响程度。我们发现参与者利用模糊性与真相保持一致，同时利用不确定性来获益。更多的参与者在关注社会身份的情况下使用模糊信息。此外，我们发现社会身份关注对不同处理中使用的模糊信息的长度和模式产生了显著影响。",
