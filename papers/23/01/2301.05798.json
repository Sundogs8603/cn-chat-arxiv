    "translated_abstract": "本文评估了雇佣的自动驾驶车辆（AVs）对公平性的影响，并研究了促进未来自动远程出行生态系统的空间和社会公平的监管政策。为此，我们考虑了一个综合交通网络，其中一家打车平台经营一批AVs来提供按需行动的出行服务，并与提供交通服务的公共交通机构竞争。我们开发了一个博弈论模型，描述了打车平台、公共交通机构和具有不同收入水平的多类乘客之间的紧密互动。我们提出了一个算法来计算博弈的纳什均衡，并对所获得解决方案的性能进行了事后评估。基于提出的框架，我们使用Theil指数评估了交通可及性的空间和社会公平，并发现尽管雇佣的自动驾驶车辆在打车网络中的普及会导致基于空间和社会的公平性降低",
