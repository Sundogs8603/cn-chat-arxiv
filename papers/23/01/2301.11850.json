    "abstract": "Predicting the factuality of news reporting and bias of media outlets is surely relevant for automated news credibility and fact-checking. While prior work has focused on the veracity of news, we propose a fine-grained reliability analysis of the entire media. Specifically, we study the prediction of sentence-level factuality of news reporting and bias of media outlets, which may explain more accurately the overall reliability of the entire source. We first manually produced a large sentence-level dataset, titled \"FactNews\", composed of 6,191 sentences expertly annotated according to factuality and media bias definitions from AllSides. As a result, baseline models for sentence-level factuality prediction were presented by fine-tuning BERT. Finally, due to the severity of fake news and political polarization in Brazil, both dataset and baseline were proposed for Portuguese. However, our approach may be applied to any other language.",

    "translated_abstract": "预测新闻报道的事实性和媒体倾向对于自动化的新闻信誉和事实核查是很重要的。本文提出了对整个媒体进行细粒度可靠性分析的方法。我们研究了预测新闻报道的句子级别事实性和媒体倾向，这可以更精确地解释整个 source 的可靠程度。我们首先手动制作了一个大型的句子级别数据库，“FactNews”，由 6191 个专家注释的句子组成，注释依据来自 AllSides 的事实性和媒体倾向定义。最后，由于巴西存在严重的虚假新闻和政治极化问题，我们提供了用于葡萄牙语的数据集和基线模型。但是，我们的方法可以应用于任何其他语言。",
