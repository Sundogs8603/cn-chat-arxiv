    "translated_abstract": "深度监督学习算法通常需要大量标记的样本来达到令人满意的性能。然而，收集和标记过多的样本可能成本高昂且耗时。作为无监督学习的子集，自监督学习（SSL）旨在从未标记的样本中学习有用的特征，而无需任何人工标注的标签。SSL最近引起了广泛关注，并且已经开发了许多相关算法。然而，目前很少有综述研究来解释不同的SSL变体之间的关系和演变。本文从算法、应用、三个主要趋势和待解问题的视角综述了各种SSL方法。首先，详细介绍了大多数SSL算法的动机，并比较了它们的共性和差异。其次，概述了SSL在图像处理和计算机视觉（CV）以及自然语言处理（NLP）等领域中的典型应用。",
