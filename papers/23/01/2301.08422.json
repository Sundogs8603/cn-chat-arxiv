    "translated_abstract": "基于钻炸法的隧道建设需要对挖掘前部位进行三维测量以评估压碎位置。为了考虑检测和测量任务的安全、成本和效益，部署轻便的自主机器人，如无人机（UAV），变得更加必要和普遍。大多数先前的工作都使用先前的地图进行检验视点的确定并没有考虑动态障碍物。为了最大限度地增加自主水平，本文提出了一种基于视觉的无人机视检测框架，用于动态隧道环境而无需使用先前的地图。我们的方法利用分层规划方案将检测问题分解成不同层次。高层决策者首先确定机器人的任务并生成目标点。然后，中层路径规划器找到途径点路径并优化免碰撞静态轨迹。最后，静态轨迹将输入低层控制器以实现控制。",
