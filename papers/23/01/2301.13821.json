Yet, to date, no model with polynomial complexity is known to be complete, that is, able to distinguish between any pair of non-isomorphic point clouds. We fill this theoretical gap by showing that point clouds can be completely determined, up to permutation and rigid motion, by applying the 3-WL graph isomorphism test to the point cloud's centralized Gram matrix. Moreover, we formulate an Euclidean variant of the 2-WL test and show that it is also sufficient to achieve completeness. We then show how our complete Euclidean WL tests can be simulated by an Euclidean graph neural network of moderate size and demonstrate their separation capability on highly symmetrical point clouds.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，在对点云建模时，神经网络已经取得了成功，因为它们尊重排列和刚性运动的自然不变性，从分子动力学到推荐系统，从几何现象到推荐系统。然而，迄今未知具有多项式复杂性的模型是完备的，即能够区分任意一对非同构点云。我们通过展示可以将点云完全确定，直到排列和刚性运动，通过将3-WL图同构测试应用于点云的集中Gram矩阵来填补这一理论空白。此外，我们制定了2-WL测试的欧几里得变体，并展示它也足以实现完整性。然后，我们展示了如何通过中等大小的欧几里得图神经网络模拟我们的完全欧几里得WL测试，并展示了它们在高度对称的点云上的分离能力。",
