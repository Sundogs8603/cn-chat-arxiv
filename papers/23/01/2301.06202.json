    "abstract": "Notions of iteration range from the arguably most general Elgot iteration to a very specific Kleene iteration. The fundamental nature of Elgot iteration has been extensively explored by Bloom and Esik in the form of iteration theories, while Kleene iteration became extremely popular as an integral part of (untyped) formalisms, such as automata theory, regular expressions and Kleene algebra. Here, we establish a formal connection between Elgot iteration and Kleene iteration in the form of Elgot monads and Kleene monads, respectively. We also introduce a novel class of while-monads, which like Kleene monads admit a relatively simple description in algebraic terms. Like Elgot monads, while-monads cover a large variety of models that meaningfully support while-loops, but may fail the Kleene algebra laws, or even fail to support a Kleen iteration operator altogether.",

    "translated_abstract": "迭代概念从最通用的Elgot迭代到非常特定的Kleene迭代不等。 Bloom和Esik已经以迭代理论的形式广泛探讨了Elgot迭代的基本本质，而Kleene迭代则作为（无类型的）形式主义的重要组成部分变得非常流行，例如自动机理论，正则表达式和Kleene代数。在这里，我们通过Elgot单子和Kleene单子建立Elgot迭代和Kleene迭代之间的形式连接。 我们还介绍了一种新的while-monad类，类似于Kleene monads，但在代数术语中有相对简单的描述。与Elgot单子一样，while-monads涵盖了支持while循环的大量模型，但可能不符合Kleene代数定律，甚至可能根本不支持Kleene迭代运算符。",
