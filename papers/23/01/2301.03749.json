    "translated_abstract": "切片Wasserstein（SW）距离由于独立的均匀随机投影方向而导致冗余投影。为了部分克服这个问题，最大K切片Wasserstein（Max-K-SW）距离（$K\\geq1$）寻求最佳的区分正交投影方向。尽管能够减少投影数量，但Max-K-SW的度量性在实践中不能保证，原因是优化的非最优性。此外，正交约束也在计算上是昂贵的，可能不太有效。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种新的SW距离家族，称为马尔可夫切片Wasserstein（MSW）距离，它在投影方向上施加了一阶马尔可夫结构。我们通过指定马尔可夫结构，包括先验分布、转移分布以及燃烧和稀疏化技术，讨论了MSW的各种成员。此外，我们还研究了MSW的理论性质，包括拓扑性质（found in translation）",
