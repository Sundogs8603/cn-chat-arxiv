    "translated_abstract": "在在线广告拍卖中，广告主越来越多地使用自动竞标机制来投标，而不是手动竞标其价值。其中一个重要的自动出价格式是目标每项成本（tCPA），它在投资回报约束条件下最大化转化量。然而，从拍卖理论的角度来看，这种趋势似乎违反了基本的结果，即对于利润最大化的投标者来说，使用经典的边际成本（mCPA）投标系统比使用tCPA等策略更优。本文在经典的准线性框架内合理地采用了这种看似次优的投标方式。论文的核心在于承诺的概念。我们考虑一个多阶段博弈，在这个博弈中，首先拍卖人宣布拍卖规则；然后投标人选择tCPA或mCPA出价格式，然后，如果拍卖人没有承诺，它可以重新审视拍卖规则。",
