    "translated_abstract": "众包已经成为一种标记大量数据的有效平台，具有成本和时间效益。大部分先前的工作都集中在设计一种有效的算法，仅恢复数据的真实标签。在本文中，我们考虑了多项选择众包任务，目标不仅是恢复真实标签，还包括最令人困惑的答案和混淆概率。最令人困惑的答案提供了关于任务的有用信息，揭示了除真实答案以外最可信的答案以及它的可信度。为了理论分析这样的情况，我们提出了一个模型，每个任务有两个最可信的答案，与其他选择有所不同。任务难度由前两个答案之间的混淆概率量化，工作可靠性由给出前两个答案的概率量化。在此模型下，我们提出了一个两阶段推断算法来推断前两个答案和混淆概率。",
