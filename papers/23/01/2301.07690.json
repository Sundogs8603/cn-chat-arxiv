    "translated_abstract": "机器人系统具有组合化的大配置空间，以及数百或数千种可能的软硬件配置选项，这些选项之间相互非平凡地交互。配置参数被设置为特定目标，但如果配置不正确，则可能导致功能故障。由于指数级的配置空间以及机器人配置设置与性能之间的相互依赖性，找到此类故障的根本原因具有挑战性。本文提出了CaRE方法，通过因果关系的视角来诊断功能故障的根本原因。 CaRE通过学习因果结构并估计选项对机器人性能指标的因果效应来抽象各种配置选项与机器人性能目标之间的因果关系。我们通过找到观察到的功能故障的根本原因以及通过进行实验验证所诊断的根本原因来展示CaRE的功效。",
