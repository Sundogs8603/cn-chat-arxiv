    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) provide a new way to build chatbots by accepting natural language prompts. Yet, it is unclear how to design prompts to power chatbots to carry on naturalistic conversations while pursuing a given goal, such as collecting self-report data from users. We explore what design factors of prompts can help steer chatbots to talk naturally and collect data reliably. To this aim, we formulated four prompt designs with different structures and personas. Through an online study (N = 48) where participants conversed with chatbots driven by different designs of prompts, we assessed how prompt designs and conversation topics affected the conversation flows and users' perceptions of chatbots. Our chatbots covered 79% of the desired information slots during conversations, and the designs of prompts and topics significantly influenced the conversation flows and the data collection performance. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of building chatbots with LLMs.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）提供了一种通过接受自然语言提示来构建聊天机器人的新方法。然而，如何设计提示来使聊天机器人在追求给定目标（如从用户收集自我报告数据）的同时进行自然对话尚不清楚。我们探讨了哪些提示的设计因素可以帮助引导聊天机器人进行自然对话并可靠地收集数据。为此，我们设计了四种具有不同结构和人设的提示形式。通过一项在线研究（N = 48），参与者与由不同设计提示驱动的聊天机器人进行对话，我们评估了设计提示和对话主题如何影响对话流程和用户对聊天机器人的感知。在对话过程中，我们的聊天机器人覆盖了79%的所需信息槽，并且提示和主题的设计显著影响了对话流程和数据收集性能。我们讨论了利用LLMs构建聊天机器人的机遇和挑战。",
