    "translated_abstract": "图形数据由于注入了人类先验知识，因此语义密集，模型可以从这些数据中有效地学习语义信息。因此，图神经网络（GNN）在各个领域取得了令人瞩目的成功。然而，重新审视GNN学习范式，我们发现人类专业知识与GNN模拟的知识之间的关系仍然令人困惑。为此，我们引入了激励实验，并得出实证观察结果称GNN逐渐学习到了普通领域中的人类专业知识。通过进一步观察将专业逻辑引入到图形表示学习中的后果，我们得出结论，引导GNN模型学习人类专业知识可以提高模型性能。因此，我们提出了一种新的图形表示学习方法，将人类专业知识纳入GNN模型。所提出的方法确保GNN模型不仅可以获得专业知识，同时可以将其应用于各种不同的任务中。",
