    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了预测性前向-前向（PFF）算法，用于在神经系统中进行信贷分配。具体而言，我们设计了一种新颖的动态递归神经系统，该系统与表示电路同时学习一个定向生成电路。值得注意的是，该系统集成了可学习的横向竞争，噪声注入和预测编码的元素，这是一种新兴且有效的皮层功能的神经生物学过程理论，与前向-前向（FF）适应方案一起使用。此外，PFF可以有效地学习仅通过前向传递传播学习信号并更新突触，消除了基于反向传播方案所施加的关键结构和计算约束。除了计算方面的优势外，PFF过程还可以用于理解生物神经元背景下使用本地信号的学习机制，尽管缺少反馈连接。我们在图像数据上运行实验，并证明了PFF程序的有效性。",
