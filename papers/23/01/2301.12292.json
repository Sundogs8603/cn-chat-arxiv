    "translated_abstract": "在个性化医疗、公共政策和在线营销等领域，预测不同干预措施对特定个体的因果影响非常重要。预测现有干预措施的影响有许多方法，这些方法基于接受过干预措施的个体的历史数据。然而，在许多场景中，预测新型干预措施的影响也很重要，这些方法无法解决。在这里，我们考虑了无先验因果学习：预测新型干预措施的个性化影响。我们提出了CaML，这是一个因果元学习框架，它将每个干预措施的个性化预测效果作为一个任务来进行处理。CaML在数千个任务中训练单一的元模型，每个任务都是通过抽样生成一个干预措施及其接收者和非接收者来构建的。通过利用干预信息（例如，药物的属性）和个体特征（例如，特定个体的医疗记录），CaML学习如何将已观察到的干预措施的知识有效地传输给未见过的干预措施。我们在合成和真实数据集上展示了我们方法的有效性，展示了该方法具有推广到未见过干预措施并胜过现有方法的能力。",

By using meta-learning to formulate personalized prediction of each intervention's effect as a task, CaML can effectively transfer knowledge from observed interventions to unseen ones. The effectiveness of CaML is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world datasets and outperforms existing methods."
