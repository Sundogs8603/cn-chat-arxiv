    "translated_abstract": "无监督领域自适应（UDA）人物再识别旨在从源领域的标记图像中学习身份信息，并将其应用于目标领域的未标记图像。许多无监督再识别方法的一个主要问题是它们在大的领域变化（如光照、视角和遮挡）方面表现不佳。本文提出了一个合成模型库（SMB）来处理无监督人物再识别中的光照变化。所提出的SMB包括用于特征提取的多个卷积神经网络（CNN）和用于距离度量的马氏距离矩阵。它们使用具有不同光照条件的合成数据进行训练，这使得SMB对光照变化具有鲁棒性。为了更好地量化光照强度并提高合成图像的质量，我们引入了一个基于GAN的新型三维虚拟人类数据集进行图像合成。通过实验，我们证明了所提出方法的有效性。",
