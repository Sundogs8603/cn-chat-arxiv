    "translated_abstract": "动态时间规整（DTW）是一种流行的时间序列距离度量方法，它将两个序列中的点进行对齐。这些对齐支持时间维度的扭曲，以允许以不同速度展开的过程。距离是任何可允许时间维度扭曲的最小对齐代价之和。两个点之间的对齐代价是这些点值之间差异的函数。原始代价函数是这种差异的绝对值。提出了其他代价函数。一种流行的替代方法是差值的平方。然而，据我们所知，这是对使用不同代价函数的相对影响和调整代价函数以适应不同任务潜力进行的第一次研究。本文使用可调整的代价函数{\\lambda}{\\gamma}，其中{\\gamma}是参数，来实现此目的。我们表明，{\\gamma}值越高，对较大的成对差异赋予更大的重要性，而{\\gamma}值越低，则更加强调较小的差异。我们证明了一个调整的代价函数在几个基准时间序列分类数据集上，提高了使用DTW作为距离度量的最近邻分类器的准确性。",
    "tldr": "本研究参数化了动态时间规整的代价函数并在时间序列分类任务中得到应用，相比原始的绝对值代价函数，研究还提出了可调整参数的代价函数，通过调整参数可以更好地适应不同的任务，且在多个标准时间序列分类数据集上得到验证。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study parametrizes the cost function of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and applies it to time series classification. The paper proposes a tunable cost function with a parameter to better adapt to different tasks. The experiment shows that this tuned cost function improves the accuracy of the nearest neighbor classifier, using DTW as the distance measure, on several benchmark time series classification datasets in comparison to the original absolute value cost function."
