    "translated_abstract": "自监督的顺序推荐通过最大化互信息和设计良好的数据增广显著提高了推荐系统的性能。然而, 目前的互信息估计基于计算Kullback Leibler差异，并且存在许多局限性，包括非对称估计、指数样本大小需求和训练不稳定。而使用的现有数据增广大多是随机的，可能会因为随机修改而破坏顺序相关性。因此，我们提出了一种基于互Wasserstein距离最小化的新型自监督学习框架来解决这些问题，提出了Wasserstein距离测量来评估增广序列之间的互信息，通过减少原始和增广序列的概率分布之间的距离，增强互信息最大化。在实际数据集上进行的实验结果表明，我们的方法优于现有的几种顺序推荐方法。",
