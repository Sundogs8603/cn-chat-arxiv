    "translated_abstract": "随着社交网络的广泛使用，检测这些网络中讨论的主题已成为一个重要的挑战。目前的工作主要基于频繁模式挖掘或语义关系，而没有考虑语言结构。语言结构方法的意义在于发现词语之间的关系以及人类如何理解它们。因此，本文利用词汇联想的心理能力模拟概念，提出了一种基于人类词汇联想的社交网络主题检测框架。该框架基于人类词汇联想方法，并设计了专门的抽取算法。该方法在FA-CUP数据集上进行了评估，该数据集是主题检测领域的基准数据集。结果表明，与其他方法相比，所提出的方法在主题召回率和关键词F1值上有较好的改进。此外，主题检测领域中的大多数先前工作主要基于模式挖掘或语义关系。",
