To circumvent this problem, we propose Multi-dimensional Concept Discovery (MCD) as an extension of previous approaches that fulfills a completeness relation on the level of concepts.

    "translated_abstract": "完整性公理使得后续XAI方法的解释仅对模型在单个决策上有效。为了可信地应用XAI，特别是对于高风险的决策，需要更全球的模型理解。最近，已经提出了基于概念的方法，但这些方法不能保证与实际的模型推理相结合。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了多维概念发现(MCD)，作为之前方法的扩展，满足概念层面上的完整性关系。我们的方法从通用的线性子空间作为概念开始，并不需要加强概念可解释性或重新训练模型部分。我们提出了稀疏子空间聚类来发现改进的概念，充分利用了多维子空间的潜能。MCD提供了两种概念在输入空间中的互补分析工具：(1)概念激活图，显示概念表达的位置",
