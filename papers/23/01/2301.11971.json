    "translated_abstract": "本论文开发了一个框架，将Eyster和Rabin（2005）开发的可恶均衡（CE）的战略形式分析推广到多阶段游戏中。该方法使用行为策略而不是正常形式混合策略，并强制实现顺序合理性。我们定义了可恶的顺序均衡（CSE）并将其与顺序均衡和标准正常形式CE进行比较。我们提供了CSE的一般特征并确定其属性。我们在经济学和政治科学中应用CSE到五个应用程序。这些应用程序展示了CSE与贝叶斯纳什均衡或CE在信仰博弈，有前期通信的游戏，声誉建立，顺序投票以及“脏脸”游戏等动态信息不完全的游戏中存在广泛差异的范围。在其中几个应用程序中的一个共同主题是展示CSE如何以及为什么意味着动态不完全信息博弈中的系统不同的行为与贝叶斯纳什均衡有所不同。",

It can be applied to a wide range of applications such as games with preplay communication, reputation building, sequential voting, and dynamic incomplete information games such as the \"dirty faces\" game. CSE leads to systematically different behavior than Bayesian Nash Equilibrium in these applications."
