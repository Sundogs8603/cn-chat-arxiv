    "abstract": "Cross-domain NER is a challenging task to address the low-resource problem in practical scenarios. Previous typical solutions mainly obtain a NER model by pre-trained language models (PLMs) with data from a rich-resource domain and adapt it to the target domain. Owing to the mismatch issue among entity types in different domains, previous approaches normally tune all parameters of PLMs, ending up with an entirely new NER model for each domain. Moreover, current models only focus on leveraging knowledge in one general source domain while failing to successfully transfer knowledge from multiple sources to the target. To address these issues, we introduce Collaborative Domain-Prefix Tuning for cross-domain NER (CP-NER) based on text-to-text generative PLMs. Specifically, we present text-to-text generation grounding domain-related instructors to transfer knowledge to new domain NER tasks without structural modifications. We utilize frozen PLMs and conduct collaborative domain-prefix tuning",

    "translated_abstract": "解决实际场景中低资源问题是跨领域实体识别的一个挑战性任务。先前典型的解决方案主要通过使用来自丰富资源领域的数据进行预训练语言模型(PLMs)获得NER模型并将其适应于目标领域。由于不同领域实体类型之间的不匹配问题，先前的方法通常调整所有PLMs的参数，从而为每个领域结束一个全新的NER模型。此外，当前的模型只关注于利用一个普通来源领域中的知识，而未能成功地将来自多个来源领域的知识转移到目标上。为了解决这些问题，我们基于文本到文本生成的PLM引入了协作域前缀调整跨领域NER(CP-NER)。具体来说，我们呈现了用于文本到文本生成的支撑领域相关指导来将知识转移至新域NER任务而无需结构修改。我们利用冻结的PLMs并进行协作域前缀调整。",
