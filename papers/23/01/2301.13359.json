As far as we know, IAD methods are not evaluated systematically. As a result, this makes it difficult for researchers to analyze them because they are designed for different or special cases. To solve this problem, we first propose a uniform IM setting to assess how well these algorithms perform, which includes several aspects, i.e., various levels of supervision (unsupervised vs. semi-supervised), few-shot learning, continual learning, noisy labels, memory usage, and inference speed. Moreover, we skillfully build a comprehensive image anomaly detection benchmark (IM-IAD) that includes 16 algorithms on 7 mainstream datasets with uniform settings. ",

    "translated_abstract": "图像异常检测（IAD）是工业制造中一项新兴且重要的计算机视觉任务。近年来，许多先进的算法已经被发布，但它们的性能存在很大差异。我们认为，缺乏实际的工业制造设置很可能阻碍了这些方法在实际应用中的发展和使用。据我们所知，IAD方法尚未经过系统评估。因此，这使得研究人员很难分析它们，因为它们是为不同或特殊情况而设计的。为了解决这个问题，我们首先提出了一个统一的工业制造设置来评估这些算法的性能，包括几个方面，如各种监督级别（无监督vs半监督）、少样本学习、持续学习、噪声标签、内存使用和推断速度。此外，我们巧妙地构建了一个完整的图像异常检测基准（IM-IAD），该基准在统一的设置下包括了16个算法和7个主流数据集。",
