    "translated_abstract": "段子通过视觉和文本信息结合的方式可以在社交媒体上影响人们的观点。由于段子可以迅速传播，因此推断段子的意图和潜在的有害性并采取及时的措施变得至关重要。在理解段子中所引用的实体和刻画每个实体的角色方面，常常会出现一个常见的问题。本文旨在了解段子是否美化、污名化或使每个实体成为受害者。为此，我们提出了有害段子中实体的角色识别任务，即检测段子中的“英雄”、“恶棍”和“受害者”，如果有的话。我们使用HVVMemes——最近作为CONSTRAINT@ACL-2022共享任务的一部分发布的有关美国政治和Covid-19段子的数据集。它包含了段子、引用的实体及其相关角色：英雄、恶棍、受害者和其他。此外，我们还设计了VECTOR(视觉-语义角色检测)模型来执行任务。",
