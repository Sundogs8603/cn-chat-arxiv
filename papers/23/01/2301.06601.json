    "translated_abstract": "加密资产的普及使得许多新手投资者进入了加密货币领域。这些投资者可以受到他们从社交媒体上接收到的信息的不成比例的影响。本文介绍了一个有关加密货币赏金活动和参与者的数据集。这些活动协调社交媒体活动，创造人为的“炒作”，以影响加密项目代币的价格。该数据集包含从2014年5月到2022年12月期间从BitcoinTalk在线论坛的Bounties(Altcoins)子论坛收集的15.8K个跨媒体赏金活动的信息、185K个参与者、10M条论坛评论和82M个社交媒体URL。我们描述了数据收集和数据处理方法，并对数据集进行了基本特征的描述。此外，我们探讨了该数据集在许多领域内提供的潜在研究机遇，并强调了潜在的创新点。",
