    "translated_abstract": "因果革命激发了对各个领域中复杂关系的兴趣。大多数现有方法旨在在复杂的大规模图中发现所有变量之间的因果关系。然而，在实践中，图中仅有的一小部分变量与感兴趣的结果相关。因此，使用完整的因果图进行因果估计，特别是在数据有限的情况下，可能会导致大量错误发现的虚假变量，这些虚假变量与目标结果高度相关，但对目标结果没有因果影响。在本文中，我们提出了一种学习必要和充分因果图 (NSCG) 的方法，该方法专门由与感兴趣结果因果相关的变量组成，我们将其称为因果特征。关键思想是利用因果概率系统地评估因果图中特征的重要性，从而帮助我们确定与感兴趣的结果相关的子图。",
