    "translated_abstract": "灵活双工网络允许用户在没有静态时间调度的情况下动态使用上行和下行信道，从而有效利用网络资源。本文研究了灵活双工网络的总速率最大化问题。特别地，我们考虑了具有一对一通信链接的网络。相应的组合优化问题是非确定多项式（NP）难题，没有闭合形式的解法。因此，现有的启发式算法在大型网络中存在可扩展性问题，计算复杂度很高。受近年来图神经网络（GNN）在解决NP难的无线资源管理问题方面的成功所启发，我们提出了一种新的GNN架构，名为Flex-Net，以联合优化通信方向和传输功率。所提出的GNN同时保持了低计算复杂度和接近最优性能，相较于最常用的技术而言。此外，我们的数值结果表明，在各种策略中，Flex-Net的平均性能最好。",
