    "translated_abstract": "仿射图像配准是医学图像分析的基石。虽然传统算法可以实现优秀的准确性，但它们需要为每一对图像进行耗时的优化。深度学习方法通过学习一个将图像对映射到输出变换的函数来解决这个问题。评估这个函数是快速的，但捕捉大的变换可能是具有挑战性的，而且如果测试图像的特征从训练领域变化，如分辨率，网络往往会出现困难。大多数仿射方法是对解剖结构无知的，意味着如果算法考虑图像中的所有结构，配准会不准确。我们通过SynthMorph解决了这些缺点，它是一个易于使用的DL工具，用于对任何脑图像进行联合仿射-可变形配准，无需预处理即可直接从MRI扫描仪进行操作。首先，我们利用从标签图生成的具有极大差异的图像来训练网络的策略，从而实现对训练过程中未见的多样化采集规范的鲁棒性能。其次，我们优化网络的损失函数，使其能够考虑不同的解剖特征和学习抵制采集特定限制的变换。通过这些创新，我们实现了更准确和鲁棒的图像配准。",
