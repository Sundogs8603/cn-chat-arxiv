Learning abstractions which guarantee consistency with respect to interventional distributions would allow one to jointly reason about evidence across multiple levels of granularity while respecting the underlying cause-effect relationships. In this paper, we introduce a first framework for causal abstraction learning between SCMs based on the formalization of abstraction recently proposed by Rischel (2020). Based on that, we propose a differentiable programming solution that jointly solves a number of combinatorial sub-problems, and we study its performance and benefits against independent and sequential approaches on synthetic settings and on a challenging real-world problem related to electric vehicle battery manufacturing.",

    "translated_abstract": "抽象可以用来将代表同一系统不同分辨率的两个结构因果模型关联起来。学习保证在干预分布方面一致性的抽象将允许人们在尊重潜在因果关系的同时跨多个细粒度级别共同推断证据。本文介绍了一种基于Rischel（2020）提出的抽象形式化方法的SCMs因果抽象学习框架。在此基础上，我们提出了一种可微分的编程方法，同时解决了多个组合子问题，并在合成环境和与电动汽车电池制造相关的具有挑战性的真实问题上研究了其性能和优势。",
