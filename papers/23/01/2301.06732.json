    "translated_abstract": "随着人类开始探索太空，太空天气的重要性变得明显。已经确立了太阳冕空洞这一种太空天气现象会对飞机和卫星的运作产生影响。太阳冕空洞是太阳上的一片区域，其特点是磁场线开放而温度相对较低，导致太阳风以高于平均速率进行发射。在本研究中，为了准备好应对太阳冕空洞对地球的影响，我们使用计算机视觉检测太阳动力学观测卫星（SDO）图像中的太阳冕空洞区域并计算其大小。我们对太阳每个区域的太阳冕空洞进行比较和相关性分析。然后，我们实施深度学习技术，特别是使用长短期记忆（LSTM）方法分析太阳冕空洞面积数据的趋势，并预测不同太阳区域未来7天的太阳冕空洞大小。通过分析太阳冕空洞面积的时间序列数据，本研究旨在辨识太阳冕空洞的变化趋势和预测其大小。",
