In this paper, our focus is on using large datasets in quantile regression models to forecast the conditional distribution of US GDP growth. To capture possible non-linearities, we include several nonlinear specifications. The resulting models will be huge dimensional and we thus rely on a set of shrinkage priors. Since Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimation becomes slow in these dimensions, we rely on fast variational Bayes approximations to the posterior distribution of the coefficients and the latent states. We find that our proposed set of models produces precise forecasts. These gains are especially pronounced in the tails. Using Gaussian processes to approximate the nonlinear component of the model further improves the good performance, in particular in the right tail.",

    "translated_abstract": "建模和预测GDP的极端波动通常很困难，适当的协变量选择和/或非线性形式对于获得准确的预测至关重要。本文的重点是使用大数据集在分位数回归模型中预测美国GDP增长的条件分布。为了捕捉可能的非线性特征，我们包括了几种非线性规范。由此产生的模型将具有很高的维度，因此我们依赖于一组收缩先验。由于在此维度下Markov Chain Monte Carlo估计变慢，我们依赖于快速变分贝叶斯近似来估计系数和潜在状态的后验分布。我们发现我们提出的模型组合产生了准确的预测。这些改进在尾部特别明显。使用高斯过程来近似模型的非线性部分进一步改进了性能，尤其是在右尾部。",
