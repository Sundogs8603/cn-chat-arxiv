Such techniques require large amounts of training data, resulting in computationally expensive algorithms that are unsuitable for settings where only a small amount of normal samples are available for training. We propose 'Few Shot anOMaly detection' (FewSOME), a deep One-Class Anomaly Detection algorithm with the ability to accurately detect anomalies having trained on 'few' examples of the normal class and no examples of the anomalous class. We describe FewSOME to be of low complexity given its low data requirement and short training time. FewSOME is aided by pretrained weights with an architecture based on Siamese Networks. By means of an ablation study, we demonstrate how our proposed loss, 'Stop Loss', improves the robustness of FewSOME. Our experiments demonstrate that FewSOME performs at state-of-the-art level on benchmark datasets MNIST, CIFAR-1",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的异常检测技术在推动该领域的同时也逐渐变得复杂，需要大量的训练数据，这导致算法计算量大，不适合在只有少量正常样本可用于训练的情况下使用。本文提出了一种基于孪生网络的深度一类异常检测算法FewSOME，它可以在只有很少量的正常类别样本和没有异常类别样本的情况下准确地检测出异常。由于少量数据要求和较短的训练时间，FewSOME 的复杂度较低。通过消融实验，我们证明了我们提出的 Stop Loss 损失函数如何提高 FewSOME 的鲁棒性。在 MNIST、CIFAR-10 和 GTSRB等基准数据集上的实验结果表明FewSOME的性能已达到最先进水平。",
