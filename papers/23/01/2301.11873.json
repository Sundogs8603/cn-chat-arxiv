    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯模型比较（BMC）提供了一种基于原则的方法来评估竞争计算模型的相对优势，并将不确定性传播到模型选择决策中。然而，由于高维嵌套参数结构，BMC在常见的层次模型中常常难以计算。为了解决这个难题，我们提出了一种深度学习方法，用于对任何可实例化为概率程序的层次模型集进行BMC。由于我们的方法支持分摊推断，它可以在任何实际数据应用之前，对后验模型概率进行高效的重新估计和快速性能验证。在一系列广泛的验证研究中，我们对比了我们的方法与最先进的桥式抽样方法的性能，并展示了在所有BMC设置中出色的分摊推断能力。然后，我们展示了我们的方法，通过比较先前被认为是四个层次证据积累模型。",
