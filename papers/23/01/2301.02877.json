    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new method based on Deep Galerkin Methods (DGMs) for solving high-dimensional stochastic Mean Field Games (MFGs). We achieve this by using two neural networks to approximate the unknown solutions of the MFG system and forward-backward conditions. Our method is efficient, even with a small number of iterations, and is capable of handling up to 300 dimensions with a single layer, which makes it faster than other approaches. In contrast, methods based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) cannot solve MFGs with non-separable Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to a traffic flow problem, which was previously solved using the Newton iteration method only in the deterministic case. We compare the results of our method to analytical solutions and previous approaches, showing its efficiency. We also prove the convergence of our neural network approximation with a single hidden layer using the universal approximation theorem.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种基于深度伽辽金方法（DGMs）的新方法，用于解决高维随机均场博弈（MFGs）问题。我们通过使用两个神经网络来近似MFG系统和前向-后向条件的未知解来实现这一目标。我们的方法高效，即使迭代次数较少，也能处理高达300维的问题，速度更快于其他方法。相比之下，基于生成对抗网络（GAN）的方法无法解决具有非可分离哈密顿量的MFG问题。我们通过将我们的方法应用于交通流问题来证明我们方法的有效性，以前该问题仅在确定性情况下使用牛顿迭代方法解决。我们将我们的方法的结果与解析解和先前的方法进行了比较，展示了其高效性。我们还使用通用逼近定理证明了我们的神经网络近似的收敛性，其中仅使用了单层隐藏层。",
