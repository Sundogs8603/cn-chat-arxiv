    "translated_abstract": "在治疗设计中，平衡各种理化性质对于分子开发至关重要，类似于多参数优化（MPO）评估多个变量以实现主要目标的方式。虽然现在可以使用“\\textit{in silico}”方法预测许多分子特征，从而帮助早期药物开发，但高通量虚拟筛选产生的大量数据挑战了传统MPO方法的实用性。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种以支架为重点的基于图的马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛框架（ScaMARS），用于生成具有最优性质的分子。这个创新的框架能够自我训练，并处理更广泛范围的性质，根据起始支架采样不同的化学空间。对多个性质的基准分析显示，ScaMARS具有84.6％的多样性分数，并且与条件模型相比，成功率高达99.5％。将新特性集成到MPO中显著提高了效果。",
