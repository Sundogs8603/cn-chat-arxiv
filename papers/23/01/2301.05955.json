    "abstract": "In this study, we present a wireless (non-contact) gesture recognition method using only incoherent light wave signals reflected from a human subject. In comparison to existing radar, light shadow, sound and camera-based sensing systems, this technology uses a low-cost ubiquitous light source (e.g., infrared LED) to send light towards the subject's hand performing gestures and the reflected light is collected by a light sensor (e.g., photodetector). This light wave sensing system recognizes different gestures from the variations of the received light intensity within a 20-35cm range. The hand gesture recognition results demonstrate up to 96% accuracy on average. The developed system can be utilized in numerous Human-computer Interaction (HCI) applications as a low-cost and non-contact gesture recognition technology.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种仅使用来自被试反射的非相干光波信号进行无线（非接触）手势识别的方法。与现有的雷达、光影、声音和基于相机的传感系统相比，该技术使用低成本的普及光源（例如红外LED）向执行手势的被试发送光，并且反射光由光传感器（例如光电探测器）收集。该光波传感系统可以识别不同手势，在20-35cm范围内根据接收到的光强变化。手势识别结果表明平均准确率达到96％。所开发的系统可以作为低成本和非接触手势识别技术，在众多人机交互（HCI）应用中得到广泛应用。",
