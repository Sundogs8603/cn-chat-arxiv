    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于多割（Multicut，又称加权相关聚类）的图聚类方法，该方法不需要像原始的稀疏多割方法一样指定图的拓扑结构，使得我们的方法更加简单，性能也有可能更好。与非加权相关聚类不同，我们允许更具表现力的加权成本结构。在密集多割中，聚类目标以节点特征向量的内积的形式表示，这使得任务的表示和推理相对于多割/加权相关聚类更加高效，后者在完整图上的表示和计算复杂度至少是二次的。我们展示了如何在我们的密集设置下重写经典贪心算法的多割方法，并如何修改它们以提高效率和解决方案质量。特别地，我们的算法可扩展到拥有数万个节点的图中。在ImageNet和CIFAR数据集上的实证证明了我们的方法优于或与现有方法不相上下，同时计算效率更高。",

    "en_tdlr": "ClusterFuG proposes a graph clustering approach based on multicut on the complete graph, which allows for a more expressive weighted cost structure without specifying the graph topology, leading to better performance and computational efficiency. By representing the clustering objective in inner product form, the algorithm is more efficient. Empirical evidence on ImageNet and CIFAR datasets demonstrates the approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
