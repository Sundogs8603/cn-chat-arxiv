    "translated_abstract": "基于SSVEP的脑机接口因其高信息传输速率和目标数量可用性而受到广泛关注。然而，频率识别方法的性能在很大程度上取决于用户校准数据的数量和数据长度，这限制了它在实际应用中的部署。最近，基于生成对抗网络（GANs）的数据生成方法已被广泛采用来创建合成的脑电数据，有望解决这些问题。本文提出了一种基于GANs的端到端信号转化网络TEGAN，用于数据长度扩展。TEGAN可以将短SSVEP信号转换成长的人工SSVEP信号。通过将一个新颖的U型生成器架构和一个辅助分类器加入到网络结构中，TEGAN可以在合成数据中产生有条件的特征。此外，我们实现并比较了两种最先进的频率识别方法，以评估TEGAN生成数据的有效性。实验结果表明，所提出的TEGAN方法优于传统的线性插值方法和最先进的基于深度学习的方法。所提出的TEGAN方法可以显著提高BCI系统的效率，减少所需的校准时间并改善分类的准确性。",
