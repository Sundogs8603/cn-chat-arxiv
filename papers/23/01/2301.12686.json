    "abstract": "Pre-trained diffusion models have been successfully used as priors in a variety of linear inverse problems, where the goal is to reconstruct a signal from noisy linear measurements. However, existing approaches require knowledge of the linear operator. In this paper, we propose GibbsDDRM, an extension of Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM) to a blind setting in which the linear measurement operator is unknown. GibbsDDRM constructs a joint distribution of the data, measurements, and linear operator by using a pre-trained diffusion model for the data prior, and it solves the problem by posterior sampling with an efficient variant of a Gibbs sampler. The proposed method is problem-agnostic, meaning that a pre-trained diffusion model can be applied to various inverse problems without fine-tuning. In experiments, it achieved high performance on both blind image deblurring and vocal dereverberation tasks, despite the use of simple generic priors for the underlying linear operators.",

    "translated_abstract": "在各种线性逆问题中，预训练扩散模型已成功用作先验，目标是从噪声线性测量中重构信号。然而，现有方法需要了解线性算子。在本文中，我们提出了GibbsDDRM，它是将Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models(DDRM)扩展到线性测量算子未知的盲场景。GibbsDDRM利用预训练的扩散模型构建了数据、测量和线性算子的联合分布，并通过采用一种高效的Gibbs采样器的变体进行后验采样来解决问题。所提出的方法是问题不可知的，意味着预训练的扩散模型可以应用于各种逆问题而无需微调。在实验证明，尽管使用了简单的通用先验来处理底层线性算子，该方法在盲图像去模糊和语音去混响任务上均取得了高性能。",
