    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的可微漩涡粒子（DVP）方法，从单个视频中推断和预测流体动力学。其核心是基于粒子的潜在空间，用于包含支撑可观测的欧拉流现象的隐蔽的拉格朗日漩涡演化。我们的可微漩涡粒子与可学习的漩涡到速度动力学映射相结合，以有效地捕捉物理约束的复杂流特征、低维空间。该表示有助于学习针对输入视频的流体模拟器，可提供稳健的、长期的未来预测。我们方法的价值在于两个方面：首先，我们学习的模拟器使得可以纯粹通过视觉观察来推断隐含的物理量（例如速度场）；其次，它还支持未来预测，构造输入视频的序列以及其未来的动态演化。在合成和真实世界视频上，我们将我们的方法与一系列现有方法进行比较，并展示出优越的定量和定性性能，以及对噪声和不完整数据的稳健性。",
