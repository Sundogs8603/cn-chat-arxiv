    "translated_abstract": "Nayyar等人在其开创性的工作中表明，通过在游戏过程中让玩家公开宣布其策略，不完美信息可以被从共同效益游戏中抽象出来。这个见解是支撑共同效益游戏合理的求解器和决策时间规划算法的基础。不幸的是，将同样的见解简单应用于两人零和博弈会失败，因为具有公开策略宣布的游戏的纳什均衡可能与原始游戏的纳什均衡不相对应。因此，现有的合理的决策时间规划算法需要复杂的额外机制，其具有不吸引人的特性。本文的主要贡献是展示某些正则化均衡不具有上述的不对应问题，因此，计算它们可以被视为完全信息问题。因为这些正则化均衡可以被无限接近纳什均衡，我们的结果为一种新的视角打开了大门。",
