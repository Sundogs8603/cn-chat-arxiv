    "translated_abstract": "网络离散动力系统常用于模拟传染病的传播和决策协调游戏中的代理。这种动力系统的不动点代表系统收敛到的配置。在传播不良传染病（如谣言和错误信息）方面，收敛到受影响节点数量较少的不动点是一个值得追求的目标。受这些考虑的启发，我们提出了一个新颖的优化问题，即寻找具有最小受影响节点数量的系统非平凡不动点。我们确定，除非P = NP，否则没有多项式时间算法可以在任意小于 n^1-\\epsilon 的因子内近似求解这个问题。为了应对这种计算上的难题，我们确定了几种特殊情况，可以高效地解决这个问题。此外，我们引入了一个整数线性规划来解决这个问题。",
