    "translated_abstract": "约有8000万美国人因衰老、压力、药物或基因缘由而患上脱发症。头发和头皮相关的疾病往往在早期时被忽视。有时，患者无法区分脱发和正常的掉发。诊断与头发有关的疾病很耗时，因为它需要专业的皮肤科医生进行视觉和医学测试。因此，总体诊断时间的延迟加剧了疾病的严重程度。由于具有图像处理能力，神经网络应用于各个领域，尤其是医疗保健和健康信息学，可以预测像癌症和肿瘤等致命疾病。这些应用程序协助临床医生和患者，提供早期症状的初步见解。在本研究中，我们使用深度学习方法成功预测了三种主要的脱发和头皮相关疾病：斑秃、银屑病和毛囊炎。然而，这方面的研究还很有限。",
