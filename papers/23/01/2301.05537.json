    "abstract": "The Linear-Quadratic Regulation (LQR) problem with unknown system parameters has been widely studied, but it has remained unclear whether $\\tilde{ \\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret, which is the best known dependence on time, can be achieved almost surely.

The controller features a circuit-breaking mechanism, which circumvents potential safety breach and guarantees the convergence of the system parameter estimate, but is shown to be triggered only finitely often and hence has negligible effect on the asymptotic performance of the controller. The proposed controller is also validated via simulation on Tennessee Eastman Process~(TEP), a commonly used industrial process example.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于未知系统参数的线性二次调节问题(LQR)已经得到广泛研究，但是至今仍不清楚是否能几乎必然地达到 $\\tilde{ \\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ 的后悔上限，而本文则提出了一种自适应LQR控制器，在几乎必然的情况下具有 $\\tilde{ \\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ 后悔上限的证明。该控制器具有断电机制，可以绕过潜在的安全隐患并确保系统参数估计的收敛性，但被证明只会有有限次触发，并对控制器的渐近性能几乎没有影响。通过在田纳西伊士曼(Tennessee Eastman)工艺中进行仿真验证了该控制器的有效性。",
