    "abstract": "Research on automated essay scoring has become increasing important because it serves as a method for evaluating students' written-responses at scale. Scalable methods for scoring written responses are needed as students migrate to online learning environments resulting in the need to evaluate large numbers of written-response assessments. The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate three active learning methods than can be used to minimize the number of essays that must be scored by human raters while still providing the data needed to train a modern automated essay scoring system. The three active learning methods are the uncertainty-based, the topological-based, and the hybrid method. These three methods were used to select essays included as part of the Automated Student Assessment Prize competition that were then classified using a scoring model that was training with the bidirectional encoder representations from transformer language model. All three active learning met",

    "translated_abstract": "自动化评分的研究变得越来越重要，因为它作为一种评估学生大规模书面作答能力的方法。随着学生转向在线学习环境，需要评估大量书面作答评估。本研究的目的是描述和评估三种可以用于最小化必须由人工评分者进行评分的作文数量的主动学习方法，同时仍然提供训练现代自动化论文打分系统所需的数据。这三种主动学习方法是基于不确定性、基于拓扑、混合方法。这三种方法被用于选择作为自动化学生评估奖竞赛的一部分的文章，之后使用双向编码器表示法从变换语言模型中进行训练的评分模型进行分类。",
