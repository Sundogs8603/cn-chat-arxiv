This approximation works very well and it can be used to calibrate all ATM swaptions. It works fast and accurate. In order to reproduce all available swaption prices we need to take into account the dependence of forward volatility on the current swap rate. Here we assume that forward volatility is a deterministic function on strike, tenor, and expiration at every point on the grid. We determine these functions and apply them in Monte-Carlo calculations. It was demonstrated that this approach works well. However, in the case of short term and low tenor swaptions we observed errors in swaption pricing. To fix this problem we need to modify the scenario generation process.",

    "translated_abstract": "提出了一种在利率模型中实现本地波动率的新方法。该方法的主要工具是小波动率近似。此近似方法非常有效，可以用于校准所有平值互换。它快速又精确。为了重现所有可用的互换价格，我们需要考虑正向波动率对当前互换率的依赖性。在此，我们假设正向波动率是一个确定性函数，具有在网格上的每一点上的行权价格、到期时间和到期时间的决定。我们确定这些函数并将它们应用于蒙特卡罗计算中。实验证明，这种方法运行良好。然而，在短期和低期限互换中，我们观察到互换定价错误。为了解决这个问题，我们需要修改场景生成过程。",
