    "translated_abstract": "近年来，半监督学习（SSL）得到了广泛探索，并成为利用未标记数据减少依赖标记数据的有效方法。本文将神经过程（NPs）调整为半监督图像分类任务，得到一种名为NP-Match的新方法。NP-Match适用于此任务，原因在于它隐含地比较数据点来进行预测，因此每个未标记的数据点的预测受到相似标记数据点的影响，从而改善了伪标签的质量。其次，NP-Match能够估计可用作选择可靠伪标签未标记样本的工具的不确定性。与使用Monte-Carlo（MC）dropout实现的基于不确定性的SSL方法相比，NP-Match具有更少的计算开销来估计不确定性，可以在训练和测试阶段节省时间。我们在常用SSL数据集上进行了广泛的实验，证明了NP-Match在半监督任务上的优越性能。",
