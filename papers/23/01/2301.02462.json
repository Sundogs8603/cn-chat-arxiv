We argue that our power indices are natural extensions of the standard Penrose-Banzhaf index in simple voting games. We show that computing the criticality of a voter is #P-hard even when voting weights are polynomially-bounded in the size of the instance. However, for specific settings, such as when the underlying network is a bipartite or complete graph, recursive formulas can compute these indices for weighted voting games in pseudo-polynomial time.

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了新的权力指数来测量液态民主选举中选民的先验投票权，其中底层网络限制了委托。我们认为我们的权力指数是简单投票游戏中标准Penrose-Banzhaf指数的自然扩展。我们证明即使在投票权重在实例的规模上是多项式有界的情况下，计算选民的关键性也是＃P困难的。然而，对于特定的设置，例如当底层网络是二分图或完全图时，递归公式可以在伪多项式时间内计算这些指数以加权投票游戏。我们强调它们的理论属性，并提供数字结果，以说明限制可能的委托如何改变选民的投票权。",

It highlights the theoretical properties of these indices and provides numerical results to show the impact of restricting delegations on voters' power. The computation of these indices is shown to be challenging but can be done in pseudo-polynomial time for specific settings."
