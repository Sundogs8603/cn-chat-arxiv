    "translated_abstract": "本文研究在独立同分布样本的基础上估计两个概率分布P和Q在$\\mathbb{R}^d$上的最优输运映射的问题。现有的所有统计分析都要求输运映射是Lipschitz的，这是一个强的要求，特别是排除了输运映射是间断的情况。为了开发间断映射的估计程序，我们考虑了数据分布Q是支撑在$\\mathbb{R}^d$上有限点集上的离散测度的重要特例。我们研究了一种计算上有效的估计器，该估计器最初由Pooladian和Niles-Weed(2021)提出，基于熵最优输运，并在半离散情况下证明，它以极小极大速率$n^{-1/2}$收敛，不依赖于维度。其他标准的映射估计技术在这种情况下缺乏有限样本保证，并且被证明受到诅咒的影响",
