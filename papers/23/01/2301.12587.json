    "translated_abstract": "人类在装填洗碗机或摆放书架等接触丰富的任务中自然地利用触觉反馈。目前的机器人系统专注于避免意外触碰，通常依靠策略性放置的环境传感器。最近，已在模拟中训练并在真实机器人上部署了利用接触的操作策略。然而，它们需要某种形式的现实世界适应来弥合模拟到真实的差距，在所有情况下可能都不可行。在本文中，我们在模拟中训练利用接触的操作策略，用于将盘子装入插槽式支架等接触丰富的家庭任务，该策略在没有任何微调的情况下转移到真实机器人。我们研究了实现这种零-shot转移所需的各种要素，例如时间延迟建模，记忆表示和域随机化。我们的策略以最小的模拟到真实差距转移，并显着优于启发式和学习基线。它还推广到不同大小的盘子上。",
