    "translated_abstract": "Stein稀释是一种有前途的算法，由（Riabiz et al.，2022）提出用于后处理马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗（MCMC）的输出。其主要原则是贪婪地最小化核化Stein差异（KSD），它仅需要对数目标分布的梯度，因此非常适合贝叶斯推断。 Stein稀释的主要优势是自动消除启动期，纠正最近的MCMC算法引入的偏差，并具有收敛至目标分布的渐近特性。然而， Stein稀释存在几个经验病态，可能导致劣质逼近，这在文献中已被观察到。 在本文中，我们对这些病态进行了理论分析，以明确识别涉及的机制，并提出了改进的策略。然后，我们引入了正则化的 Stein稀释算法来缓解已识别的病态。最后，我们提供了理论保证和扩展。",
