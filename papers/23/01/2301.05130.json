    "translated_abstract": "门捷列夫随机化（MR）是一种利用基因组关联研究（GWAS）摘要数据推断曝露和结果之间因果关系的工具变量方法。然而，多变量反方差加权（IVW）方法作为大多数MR方法的基础，在存在许多弱工具变量的情况下无法产生无偏的因果效应估计。本文证明了多变量IVW估计的偏差是弱工具、估计误差偏差的乘积，后者与多个GWAS队列之间的样本重叠存在权衡关系，是由测量误差和混淆变量引起的。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的多变量MR方法，即使用校正偏差估计方程的MR（MRBEE），可以推断许多弱工具变量的无偏因果关系。在适度条件下研究了多变量IVW和MRBEE的渐近行为，结果表明当弱工具变量的数量很大时，MRBEE优于多变量IVW。",

The theoretical analysis shows that MRBEE outperforms the multivariable IVW when the number of weak IVs is large."
