    "translated_abstract": "本文通过使用一种新颖的方法，对ChatGPT（发布于2023年1月9日和1月30日）和GPT-4的数学能力进行了调查和测试，使用了公开可用的数据集以及手工制作的数据集。与正式数学不同，正式证明的大型数据库可供使用（例如，Lean数学库），当前用于基准语言模型的自然语言数学数据集要么只涵盖基础数学，要么非常小。我们通过公开发布两个新数据集：GHOSTS和miniGHOSTS来解决这个问题。这是由数学研究人员精心策划的第一个自然语言数据集，旨在涵盖研究生级数学、提供对语言模型数学能力的整体概述，并区分数学推理的多个方面。这些数据集还测试了ChatGPT和GPT-4是否可以成为专业数学家的有用助手，模拟其行为。",
    "tldr": "本研究调查了ChatGPT和GPT-4的数学能力，并通过使用新的方法以及发布两个新数据集，评估了它们在各个维度的数学推理上的表现。这是第一个涵盖研究生级数学并由数学研究人员策划的自然语言数据集，也测试了它们作为专业数学家助手的潜力。",
