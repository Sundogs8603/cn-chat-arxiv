    "translated_abstract": "确定具有不同类型约束条件(即混合约束条件)的布尔约束满足性问题是一个得到广泛研究并有重要应用的问题。在本文中，我们研究了混合布尔约束的一个新应用，即在量子计算中出现的约束完美匹配问题。虽然通用的混合约束求解器可以很强大，但我们发现将约束匹配问题直接编码为混合约束的方法无法很好地扩展，并且仍需要特殊技术。我们提出了一种基于图论中的Tutte定理以及优化技术的新编码方法。实验结果表明，我们的编码在适当的语言和先进的SAT求解器中，比许多竞争方法更能扩展约束匹配基准。我们的研究确定了在应用强大的通用约束求解器时需要设计问题特定的编码的必要性。",
