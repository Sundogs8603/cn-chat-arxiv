The success of Computational Intelligence Techniques (CIT) for inferring mental illness from such social media resources points to NLP as a lens for causal analysis and perception mining. However, we argue that more consequential and explainable research is required for optimal impact on clinical psychology practice and personalized mental healthcare. To bridge this gap, we posit two significant dimensions: (1) Causal analysis to illustrate a cause and effect relationship in the user generated text; (2) Perception mining to infer psychological perspectives of social effects on online users intentions.

    "translated_abstract": "在社交媒体上，人们之间的互动往往传达了他们行为背后的意图，为在线用户的心理健康分析提供了心理语言资源。计算智能技术在从这些社交媒体资源中推断心理疾病方面的成功，表明NLP可以作为定位因果关系和感知挖掘的镜头。然而，我们认为需要更多有意义和可解释的研究，以在临床心理学实践和个性化心理保健方面产生最佳影响。为了弥合这一差距，我们提出了两个重要维度：（1）定位因果关系以说明用户自动生成的文本中的因果关系；（2）感知挖掘以推断社交效应对在线用户意图的心理观点。在自然语言处理（NLP）范围内，我们进一步探讨与这两个维度相关的关键研究领域，特别是通过最近在话语分析方面的进展。",
