    "translated_abstract": "约束性因果发现算法通过系统地测试数据中观察到的条件独立性来学习因果图的一部分结构。这些算法，如PC算法及其变体，依赖于由Pearl提出的所谓因果图等价类的图形表征。然而，当数据有限时，约束性因果发现算法往往面临困难，因为条件独立性检验很快失去统计能力，尤其是当条件集很大时。为了解决这个问题，我们提出使用条件独立性检验，在鲁棒的因果发现中将条件集的大小上限设置为某个整数 k。然而，现有的因果图等价类的图形表征在我们不能利用所有的条件独立性语句时不适用。我们首先定义了 k-马尔可夫等价的概念：如果两个因果图得到相同的条件独立性语句，它们是 k-马尔可夫等价的。",
