    "abstract": "This paper introduces Enactive Artificial Intelligence (eAI) as an intersectional gender-inclusive stance towards AI. AI design is an enacted human sociocultural practice that reflects human culture and values. Unrepresentative AI design could lead to social marginalisation. Section 1, drawing from radical enactivism, outlines embodied cultural practices. In Section 2, explores how intersectional gender intertwines with technoscience as a sociocultural practice. Section 3 focuses on subverting gender norms in the specific case of Robot-Human Interaction in AI. Finally, Section 4 identifies four vectors of ethics: explainability, fairness, transparency, and auditability for adopting an intersectionality-inclusive stance in developing gender-inclusive AI and subverting existing gender norms in robot design.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了行动的人工智能(eAI)作为一个交叉的、包容性的AI立场。AI设计是一种人类社会文化实践，反映了人类文化和价值观。不恰当的AI设计可能导致社会边缘化。第1节从激进的行动主义出发，概述了具体的文化实践。在第2节中，探讨了交叉的性别如何与技术科学相互交织作为一种社会文化实践。第3节专注于AI中机器人与人类互动中颠覆性别规范的具体情况。最后，在第4节中，确定了四个伦理向量：可解释性、公平性、透明度和可审计性，以采用一个交叉性别包容立场开发包容性AI并颠覆现有的机器人设计性别规范。",
