    "translated_abstract": "近期的工作通过为人类设计的心理测试研究了语言模型的认知能力。尽管这些研究有助于了解这些模型的一般能力，但并不能保证一个拥有足够能力通过这些测试的模型实际上会在执行实际任务时使用这些能力。在这项工作中，我们制定了基于任务的认知能力，这是一种人类式认知能力，语言模型可以利用这种能力来执行任务。这些能力包括：(i) 快速生成良好的候选话语的能力 (搜索能力)；(ii) 预测听者如何理解这些话语，并选择最合适的话语 (语用能力)。我们设计了一个评估方案，以比较语言模型与人类的这些能力。通过将此方案应用于导航指令生成问题中的各种模型的比较，我们发现它们的语用能力。",
