The aim is two-fold: to improve the predictive power while maintaining interpretability of the models. To go beyond the black box paradigm of artificial neural networks, we propose a parsimonious and robust semi-parametric approach (i.e., a landmarking competing risks model) that combines routinely collected low-resolution data with predictive features extracted from a convolutional neural network, that was trained on high resolution time-dependent information. We then use saliency maps to analyze and explain the extra predictive power of this model. To illustrate our methodology, we focus on healthcare-associated infections in patients admitted to an intensive care unit.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的方法，将高分辨率的纵向数据与生存模型的动态预测能力相结合。其目的是双重的：提高预测能力同时保持模型的可解释性。为了超越人工神经网络的黑匣子范式，我们提出了一种简约且稳健的半参数方法（即基于里程碑竞争风险模型），将常规收集的低分辨率数据与从卷积神经网络中提取的预测特征相结合，该神经网络是在高分辨率的时间相关信息上训练的。然后，我们使用显著性地图来分析和解释该模型的额外预测能力。为了说明我们的方法，我们重点关注被送往重症监护病房的患者中与医疗相关的感染。",
