    "en_tdlr": "This paper tests firm behavior through model selection and assessment, highlighting the advantages of the Rivers and Vuong (2002) (RV) model under misspecification. The study also explores the connection between degeneracy and instrument strength, and provides a diagnostic for weak instruments using the framework of Stock and Yogo (2005). The authors test the vertical conduct using common instrument sets and find that some are weak while strong instruments support manufacturers in setting retail prices."
