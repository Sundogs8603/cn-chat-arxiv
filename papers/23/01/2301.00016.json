    "translated_abstract": "根据人工智能的最新趋势，AI系统需要就其提供的一般性和具体性决策、服务进行澄清。只有消费者对解释感到满意，例如为什么任何分类结果是任何给定时间的结果。这实际上激励我们在行为挖掘场景中使用可解释或人类可理解的AI，其中用户在数字平台上的参与度是从上下文（如情绪、活动、天气等）中确定的。然而，AI系统的输出并不总是系统上正确的，通常是系统上正确的，但明显不完美，从而造成困惑，例如，为什么做出这个决定？背后的原因是什么？在这种情况下，我们首先在深度卷积神经网络架构中制定了行为挖掘问题。最终，我们应用了递归神经网络，因为存在来自用户生理时间序列数据的情况。",
