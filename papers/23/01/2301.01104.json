    "translated_abstract": "众多物理理论都基于偏微分方程（PDEs），然而越来越复杂的物理方程，特别是缺乏解析解或闭合形式的方程，阻碍了物理学的进一步发展。传统数值方法在计算求解PDEs时面临精度和效率之间的平衡问题，并且不适用于未知潜在PDEs生成的经验数据。为了克服这一挑战，我们提出了KoopmanLab，一种高效的Koopman神经算子系列模块，用于学习没有解析解或闭合形式的PDEs。我们的模块包括多个变种的Koopman神经算子（KNO），这是一种基于动态系统理论开发的基于神经网络的PDE求解器，无需网格。紧凑的KNO变体可以准确地求解小模型尺寸的PDEs，而大型的KNO变体在预测由未知，高维动态系统控制的高度复杂的系统方面更具竞争力。",
