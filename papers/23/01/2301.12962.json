    "abstract": "The ability to plan actions on multiple levels of abstraction enables intelligent agents to solve complex tasks effectively. However, learning the models for both low and high-level planning from demonstrations has proven challenging, especially with higher-dimensional inputs. To address this issue, we propose to use reinforcement learning to identify subgoals in expert trajectories by associating the magnitude of the rewards with the predictability of low-level actions given the state and the chosen subgoal. We build a vector-quantized generative model for the identified subgoals to perform subgoal-level planning. In experiments, the algorithm excels at solving complex, long-horizon decision-making problems outperforming state-of-the-art. Because of its ability to plan, our algorithm can find better trajectories than the ones in the training set",

    "translated_abstract": "实现多级抽象的行动规划能力可以使智能体有效地解决复杂任务。然而，学习低级规划模型和高级规划模型并建立它们之间的关联具有挑战性，特别是在高维输入情况下。为了解决这个问题，我们提出使用强化学习来从专家轨迹中识别子目标，通过将奖励的大小与在给定状态和选择的子目标下可预测的低级行动相联系来实现识别。我们针对所识别的子目标建立矢量量化生成模型，以执行子目标级别的规划。在实验中，该算法优于最先进方法，能够解决复杂、长远的决策问题，因为它能够规划，所以在训练集中比现有轨迹找到了更好的轨迹。",
