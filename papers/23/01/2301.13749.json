    "abstract": "We introduce a multi-fidelity estimator of covariance matrices that employs the log-Euclidean geometry of the symmetric positive-definite manifold. The estimator fuses samples from a hierarchy of data sources of differing fidelities and costs for variance reduction while guaranteeing definiteness, in contrast with previous approaches. The new estimator makes covariance estimation tractable in applications where simulation or data collection is expensive; to that end, we develop an optimal sample allocation scheme that minimizes the mean-squared error of the estimator given a fixed budget. Guaranteed definiteness is crucial to metric learning, data assimilation, and other downstream tasks. Evaluations of our approach using data from physical applications (heat conduction, fluid dynamics) demonstrate more accurate metric learning and speedups of more than one order of magnitude compared to benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种利用对数欧氏几何的对称正定流形的多保真度协方差矩阵估计器。该估计器融合了具有不同保真度和成本的数据源层次结构的样本，以实现方差的降低，同时保证确定性，与以前的方法相比。新的估计器使得在仿真或数据收集昂贵的应用中，协方差估计成为可行的。为此，我们开发了一种最佳样本分配方案，以在固定预算的情况下最小化估计器的均方误差。保证确定性对于度量学习、数据同化和其他下游任务至关重要。我们使用物理应用（热传导、流体动力学）的数据对我们的方法进行评估，结果显示了比基准测试更准确的度量学习和超过一个数量级的加速比。",
