    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了一个问题，即学习未知的非参数系统的动力学，该系统将目标时间序列和特征时间序列联系起来。特征时间序列在稀疏和不规则的网格上测量，而我们只能访问目标时间序列的一些点。学习后，我们可以使用这些动态将特征时间序列的前几个时间点来预测目标的值。我们将这个任务作为控制微分方程（CDE）解的学习。通过利用签名理论的丰富理论，我们能够将这个非线性问题转化为高维线性回归。我们提供了一个预测误差的oracle界限，其具有明确的依赖于个体特定采样方案的依赖。我们的理论结果通过模拟得到了证明，表明我们的方法在回收完整时间序列时优于现有算法，同时计算成本较低。我们最后展示了它在现实世界流行病学中的潜力。",
