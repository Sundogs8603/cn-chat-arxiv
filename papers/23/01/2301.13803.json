    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于其提取信息特征和通过自我关注机制建模长距离依赖关系的能力，视觉变换器（ViT）在解决计算机视觉（CV）问题方面引起了广泛关注。为了充分发挥ViT在现实应用中的优势，最近的研究探索了ViT的可靠性和可解释性，包括其鲁棒性和可解释性。然而，另一个需求，公平性，在文献中尚未得到充分解决。我们证明了现有的公平感知算法（主要设计用于CNN）在ViT上表现不佳。这就需要我们通过去偏自注意（DSA）开发我们的新框架。DSA是一种通过盲目方法来强制ViT消除与敏感属性相关的虚假特征以减轻偏见的方法。值得注意的是，对抗性示例被用来定位和屏蔽输入图像块中的虚假特征。",
