    "abstract": "In response to disinformation and propaganda from Russian online media following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian outlets including Russia Today and Sputnik News were banned throughout Europe. To maintain viewership, many of these Russian outlets began to heavily promote their content on messaging services like Telegram. In this work, we study how 16 Russian media outlets interacted with and utilized 732 Telegram channels throughout 2022. Leveraging the foundational model MPNet, DP-means clustering, and Hawkes Processes, we trace how narratives spread between news sites and Telegram channels. We show that news outlets not only propagate existing narratives through Telegram, but that they source material from the messaging platform.

    "translated_abstract": "在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后，针对俄罗斯在线媒体的虚假信息和宣传，包括俄罗斯之声和卫星新闻在内的俄罗斯媒体在欧洲遭到禁止。为了保持观众数量，许多俄罗斯媒体开始在电报等消息服务上大力宣传其内容。在这项工作中，我们研究了2022年期间16家俄罗斯媒体机构如何与732个电报频道互动和利用。利用基础模型MPNet、DP-means聚类和Hawkes过程，我们跟踪新闻网站和电报频道之间的叙事传播情况。我们表明，新闻媒体不仅通过电报传播现有的叙事，而且他们会从电报平台源材料。在我们研究的网站中，2.3％（ura.news）至26.7％（ukraina.ru）的文章讨论了源于/导致电报活动的内容。最后，通过跟踪个别主题的扩散，我们测量新闻网站发表文章的速率。",
