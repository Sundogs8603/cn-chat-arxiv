    "translated_abstract": "在增量流输入（例如转录语音）中，为了对流式序列标记应用最先进的双向编码器，需要为每个新标记从头开始对每个标记进行编码。先前计算的不可重用性导致了更高数量的浮点操作（或FLOP）和更高数量的不必要标签翻转。增加的FLOP会导致更高的挂钟时间，而增加的标签翻转会导致流式性能更差。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为HEAR的混合编码器与自适应重启（HEAR），它解决了这些问题，同时保持了双向编码器在离线（或完整）输入上的表现，同时提高了流输入（或不完整）上的性能。HEAR具有混合单向 - 双向编码器架构来执行序列标记，以及自适应重启模块（ARM）以有选择地引导编码器的双向部分的重新启动。在四个序列标记数据集上，我们表明，HEAR显著地提高了流式表现，同时保持了离线性能。",

HEAR addresses the issue of unnecessary floating point operations and label flips caused by the lack of reusability of previous computation in the application of bidirectional encoders for streaming sequence tagging. HEAR also improves the tagging performance on streaming inputs while maintaining the performance of bidirectional encoders over complete inputs."
