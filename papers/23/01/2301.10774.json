    "translated_abstract": "尽管人工智能已在揭示生物大分子的一级序列与三级结构之间的关系方面取得了显着进展，但基于特定三级结构设计RNA序列仍然具有挑战性。虽然蛋白质设计中的现有方法已经彻底探索了蛋白质中结构到序列的依赖性，但RNA设计仍面临结构复杂性和数据稀缺性的困难。与此同时，虽然RNA与蛋白质共享类似的结构组分，但直接将蛋白质设计方法移植到RNA设计中却无法取得令人满意的结果。本研究旨在系统构建数据驱动的RNA设计流程。我们构建了一个大型、精心策划的基准数据集，并设计了一个全面的结构建模方法来表示复杂的RNA三级结构。更重要的是，我们提出了一个层次数据有效表示学习框架，学习结构表示的多个层次特征，以实现更高效的RNA序列设计。",
