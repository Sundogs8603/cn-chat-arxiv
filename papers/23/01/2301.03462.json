    "translated_abstract": "当前的人类活动识别（HAR）技术将活动标签视为整数类别ID，没有明确地对类别标签的语义进行建模。我们观察到不同的活动名称通常具有共享的结构。例如，“打开门”和“打开冰箱”都有“打开”作为动作；“踢足球”和“打网球”都有“球”作为物体。标签名称中的这种共享结构可以转化为感知数据的相似性，并且建模共同的结构可以帮助揭示不同活动之间的知识，特别是对于样本有限的活动。在本文中，我们提出了SHARE，一种考虑不同活动的标签名称共享结构的HAR框架。为了利用共享结构，SHARE包括一个编码器，用于从输入的感知时间序列中提取特征，并包括一个解码器，用于生成标签名称作为令牌序列。我们还提出了三种标签增强技术，以帮助模型更加有效地进行预测。",
