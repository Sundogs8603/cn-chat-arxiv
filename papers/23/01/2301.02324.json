    "translated_abstract": "因果推理和博弈论推理是人工智能等多学科的基本问题，这篇论文关注它们的交叉点。 在此之前，缺乏一个支持这两种推理的形式框架。我们提供了一种解决方案：结构因果游戏，可以看作将Pearl的因果层次结构扩展到博弈理论领域，或将Koller和Milch的多代理影响图扩展到因果领域。 我们研究了三个关键问题：1）如何以统一、有原则的方式建模游戏中的(因果)依赖性-无论是变量之间，还是策略之间？2）如何在因果游戏中计算因果查询，并需要什么假设？3）因果游戏与现有形式主义的比较？",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种新的解决方案——结构因果游戏，它将因果理论和博弈理论相结合，能够在统一、原则性的框架下建模游戏中的依赖关系和计算因果效应，是游戏中因果推理领域的一次有益尝试。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new solution, structural causal games, which combines causal theory and game theory, to model dependencies and calculate causal effects in games in a unified and principled framework. It represents a valuable attempt in the field of causal reasoning in games."
