    "translated_abstract": "视频识别模型的对抗鲁棒性评估引起了人们的关注，因为它们在安全关键任务中应用广泛。与图片相比，视频具有更高的维度，生成对抗视频时会带来巨大的计算成本。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了利用视频中的时间和空间冗余来实现在缩小的搜索空间上进行有效和高效的梯度估计的方案。为了实现这个想法，我们设计了新颖的对抗空间-时间聚焦（AstFocus）攻击方法，该攻击方法从视频的帧间和帧内同时聚焦关键帧和关键区域进行攻击，基于合作的多任务学习（MTL）框架来模拟对目标模型的影响。大量实验证明了我们提出的方法的有效性和高效性，并且我们还将其应用于评估几种最先进的视频识别模型的鲁棒性。",
