    "translated_abstract": "传统的隐马尔可夫模型是理解和建模随机动态数据的有用工具；在非高斯数据的情况下，可以使用类似高斯混合隐马尔可夫模型的模型。但是，这些模型受到精度矩阵的计算以及具有很多不必要的参数的影响。因此，这样的模型在假定所有变量独立的情况下表现更好，这可能是不现实的假设。基于核密度估计的隐马尔可夫模型也能够建模非高斯数据，但它们假定变量之间是独立的。在本文中，我们引入了一种基于核密度估计的新型隐马尔可夫模型，能够利用上下文相关贝叶斯网络捕获核依赖关系。介绍了所提出模型及其基于期望最大化算法的学习算法。此外，还将该模型与相关的HMM在合成和实际数据上进行了比较。",
