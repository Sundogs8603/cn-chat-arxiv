    "translated_abstract": "3D感知的生成对抗网络（GAN）旨在合成逼真的3D场景，以便可以以任意角度进行渲染以产生图像。尽管以前的方法可以产生逼真的图像，但它们在训练不稳定或存在不自然的3D几何解决方案方面存在问题。我们假设3D几何在约束不足的情况下是不确定的，即仅将其分类为真实图像对于鉴别器来说是不够的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出将背景近似为球形表面，并将场景表示为放置在球体中的前景和薄球形背景的联合。这样可以减少背景场的自由度。因此，我们修改了体渲染方程，并加入了专用的约束，设计了一种名为BallGAN的新型3D感知GAN框架。 BallGAN具有以下多个优点。1）它产生了更合理的3D几何；场景在不同视角下的图像具有更好的光度。",
