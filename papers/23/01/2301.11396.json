    "translated_abstract": "实际数据流中自然包含之前概念的重复。从持续学习（CL）的角度来看，重复是环境的属性，与重放不同，不能由代理程序控制。现在，类增量（CI）场景代表了评估和比较CL策略的主要测试平台。这种情况非常容易使用，但它从不允许重新访问之前看到的类，因此完全忽略了重复的作用。我们关注带有重复的类增量（CIR）场景家族，其中重复被嵌入到流的定义中。我们提出了两个随机流生成器，它们可以从单个数据集和几个可解释的控制参数开始产生各种CIR流。我们通过研究现有CL策略在不同CIR流下的行为，进行了对重复在CL中的第一次全面评估。然后我们提出了一种利用重复的新的重放策略。",
