    "translated_abstract": "随着基于人工智能的系统越来越多地被采用，AI的碳足迹已经不可忽视。因此，AI研究人员和实践者被敦促对他们设计和使用的AI模型的碳排放负责。这导致近年来出现了研究绿色AI环境可持续性的研究，这个领域被称为绿色AI。尽管对该主题的兴趣迅速增长，但至今仍缺乏综合性的绿色AI研究概述。为了填补这一空白,本文对Green AI文献进行了系统性综述。从分析98篇原始研究中，出现了不同的模式。这个主题从2020年开始经历了显著的增长。大多数研究考虑监测AI模型的碳足迹、调整超参数以提高模型的可持续性或对模型进行基准测试。混合了位置论文、观察研究和解决方案论文。大多数论文集中在训练阶段，算法",
