    "translated_abstract": "储能资源参与整个电力市场时，必须考虑价格波动和物理运行特性。由于电力价格高度波动，储能效率损失，功率和能量限制，这是一个具有挑战性的问题。本文提出了一种新颖、多功能和可转移的方法，将基于模型的优化与卷积长短期记忆网络结合起来，用于储能响应或投标整个电力市场。我们使用纽约州的历史价格进行测试，并表明我们的方法在响应价格和整个市场竞标设置中均取得了最先进的结果，在各种储能持续时间下，与完美预见情况相比，实现了70%至近90%的利润比。我们还通过预先使用纽约数据预训练出价模型，并将其应用于澳大利亚昆士兰州的套利中来测试转移学习方法。结果表明，我们的模型在新的环境中实现了强大的性能，可将出价模型从一个位置转移到另一个位置，同时保持可比的利润。",
