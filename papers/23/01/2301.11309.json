    "abstract": "Extreme classification (XC) involves predicting over large numbers of classes (thousands to millions), with real-world applications like news article classification and e-commerce product tagging. The zero-shot version of this task requires generalization to novel classes without additional supervision. In this paper, we develop SemSup-XC, a model that achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot and few-shot performance on three XC datasets derived from legal, e-commerce, and Wikipedia data. To develop SemSup-XC, we use automatically collected semantic class descriptions to represent classes and facilitate generalization through a novel hybrid matching module that matches input instances to class descriptions using a combination of semantic and lexical similarity. Trained with contrastive learning, SemSup-XC significantly outperforms baselines and establishes state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets considered, gaining up to 12 precision points on zero-shot and more than 10 precision",

    "translated_abstract": "极端分类旨在预测大量类别（数千至数百万个），具有新闻文章分类和电子商务产品标记等实际应用。这项任务的零样本版本需要在无额外监督的情况下泛化到新类别。本文提出了SemSup-XC模型，它使用自动收集的语义类别描述来表示类别，并通过新颖的混合匹配模块使用语义和词汇相似性将输入实例与类别描述进行匹配，使得在法律、电子商务和维基百科等三个XC数据集上实现了最先进的零样本和少样本性能。经过对比学习的训练，SemSup-XC明显优于基线算法，并在所有三个数据集上取得了最先进的性能，其中零样本任务上的精度提高了最多12个百分点，少样本任务上的精度提高了10个百分点以上。",
