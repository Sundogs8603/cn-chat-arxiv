However, most existing studies still rely on the full history features or full-fledged address transaction networks, thus cannot meet the requirements of early malicious address detection, which is urgent but seldom discussed by existing studies. To detect fraud behaviors of malicious addresses in the early stage, we present Evolve Path Tracer, which consists of Evolve Path Encoder LSTM, Evolve Path Graph GCN, and Hierarchical Survival Predictor. Specifically, in addition to the general address features, we propose asset transfer paths and corresponding path graphs to characterize early transaction patterns. Further, since the transaction patterns are changing rapidly during the early stage, we propose Evolve Path Encoder LSTM and Evolve Path Graph GCN to encode asset transfer path and path graph under an evolving structure setting.

    "translated_abstract": "随着加密货币的不断增长，检测欺诈行为和相关的恶意地址引起了重要的研究努力。然而，大部分现有研究仍然依赖于完整的历史交易记录或完整的地址交易网络，因此不能满足早期恶意地址检测的要求，这在现有研究中很少讨论。为了在早期发现恶意地址的欺诈行为，我们提出了演化路径追踪器，它由演化路径编码器 LSTM、演化路径图 GCN 和分层生存预测器组成。具体而言，除了一般的地址特征外，我们提出资产转移路径和相应的路径图以表征早期交易模式。此外，由于交易模式在早期阶段正在快速变化，我们提出了演化路径编码器 LSTM 和演化路径图 GCN 在演化结构设置下编码资产转移路径和路径图。分层生存预测器进一步预测目标地址是否会成为恶意地址。两个真实世界数据集的大量实验表明，演化路径追踪器在早期检测恶意地址方面优于现有的最新方法。",
