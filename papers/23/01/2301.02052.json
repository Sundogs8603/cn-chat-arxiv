    "translated_abstract": "工具变量可用于在存在未观测混淆的情况下确定因果效应，在著名的相关性和外生性（无混淆与排除）假设下。由于外生性难以证明并且在某种程度上是不可测试的，因此它经常受到应用中的批评。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了一种新的识别方法，它将传统的工具变量外生性放松为在一些未观测共同混淆因素条件下的外生性。我们假设存在一些未观测共同混淆因素的相关代理。与典型代理不同，我们的代理可以直接影响内生回归器和结果。我们在干扰中提供了线性可分离的结果模型的定点识别结果，或者在第一阶段具有严格单调性的情况下提供了定点识别结果。我们连续推导了通用的双重稳健和Neyman正交矩，以便尽管高维参数，也能进行直接的根-n估计。",
