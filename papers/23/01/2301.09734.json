As a by-product, a topological classifier is defined that uses an open sub-covering of the data set. This sub-covering can be used to construct a simplicial complex whose topological features (e.g., Betti numbers) provide information about the classification problem. We use these topological constructs to study the impact of topological complexity on learning in feedforward deep neural networks (DNNs). We hypothesize that topological complexity is negatively correlated with the ability of a fully connected feedforward deep neural network to learn to classify data correctly. We evaluate our topological classification algorithm on multiple constructed and open source data sets. We also validate our hypothesis regarding the relationship between topological complexity and learning in DNN's on multiple data sets.",
