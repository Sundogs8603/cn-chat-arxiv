    "abstract": "In the US airline industry, independent regional airlines fly passengers on behalf of several national airlines across different markets, giving rise to $\\textit{common subcontracting}$. On the one hand, we find that subcontracting is associated with lower prices, consistent with the notion that regional airlines tend to fly passengers at lower costs than major airlines. On the other hand, we find that $\\textit{common}$ subcontracting is associated with higher prices. These two countervailing effects suggest that the growth of regional airlines can have anticompetitive implications for the industry.",

    "translated_abstract": "在美国航空业中，独立的地区航空公司代表几家全国航空公司在不同的市场上为乘客飞行，这产生了“共同子承包”的情况。一方面，我们发现子承包与较低的价格有关，这符合地区航空公司比主要航空公司更低成本运输乘客的想法。另一方面，我们发现“共同”子承包与更高的价格有关。这两种相互冲突的效应表明，地区航空公司的增长可能对该行业产生反竞争影响。",
