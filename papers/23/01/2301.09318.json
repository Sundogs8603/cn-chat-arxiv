    "translated_abstract": "气候变化导致极端天气事件的概率增加，这对全球范围内的社会和企业构成风险。因此，近实时地图制作已成为支持自然灾害救援、风险管理和政府政策决策的新优先事项。最近，实现近实时制图的方法越来越多地利用深度学习（DL）。但是，基于DL的方法仅针对单个地理区域中特定频段的卫星数据的一个特定任务。因此，用于制图特定自然灾害的DL模型难以将其推广到未见过的其他类型的自然灾害上。 在这项工作中，我们提出了一种方法，通过在适当的预训练任务上进行预训练，显着提高DL自然灾害映射器的通用性。在没有任何目标领域的数据的情况下，我们展示了该改进的通用性跨越了四个透明云，烟雾柱和洪水分段任务的多个地理区域。通过合并预训练步骤，我们的模型在所有三个自然灾害分割任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时与其他DL体系结构相比，保持更快的计算速度。我们的方法代表着迈向能够在多个领域通用的近实时自然灾害制图基本模型的有希望的一步。",
