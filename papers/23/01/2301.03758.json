    "translated_abstract": "本研究研究了在有限时间内，将有限资源分配给会在到达时披露其随机需求的代理的顺序决策问题。我们的目标是设计公平的分配算法，以用尽可用的资源预算。在信息不完全的情况下做出决策时，这在序列设置中是具有挑战性的。我们将问题制定为离散时间马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）。我们提出了一种新算法SAFFE，它通过考虑到每个到达时间的未来预期需求量，根据全面披露的需求实现公平分配。该算法引入了正则化之后，就能根据代理未来需求的不确定性，使当前披露出来的需求优先于未来潜在需求。使用MDP公式，我们展示了SAFFE基于Nash社会福利公平性目标的上限，以及将其差距与最优性的绑定函数作为代理数量和horizon长度。我们的实验表明，在各种需求模式和尺寸的设置中，SAFFE实现了比几种基线更高的公平性和社会福利。",
