    "translated_abstract": "精确地模拟降水对于可靠预测人为全球变暖对生态和社会经济影响的关键。然而，产生降水的复杂跨尺度过程相互作用很难模拟，导致地球系统模型（ESMs）的字段可能存在强烈的偏差，特别是在极端情况下。目前最先进的偏差校正方法仅在每个单独的格点局部地纠正模拟频率分布的误差。到目前为止，改善ESM输出的不真实空间模式，即需要空间上下文的问题一直无法解决。本文中，我们展示了一种基于物理约束生成对抗网络（cGANs）的后处理方法，可以同时校正最先进的CMIP6级ESM的局部频率分布和空间模式中的偏差。虽然我们的方法在改善局部频率分布方面与金标准的偏差校正方法一样出色。",
