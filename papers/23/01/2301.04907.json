    "abstract": "Towards human-like dialogue systems, current emotional dialogue approaches jointly model emotion and semantics with a unified neural network. This strategy tends to generate safe responses due to the mutual restriction between emotion and semantics, and requires rare emotion-annotated large-scale dialogue corpus. Inspired by the \"think twice\" behavior in human dialogue, we propose a two-stage conversational agent for the generation of emotional dialogue. Firstly, a dialogue model trained without the emotion-annotated dialogue corpus generates a prototype response that meets the contextual semantics. Secondly, the first-stage prototype is modified by a controllable emotion refiner with the empathy hypothesis. Experimental results on the DailyDialog and EmpatheticDialogues datasets demonstrate that the proposed conversational outperforms the comparison models in emotion generation and maintains the semantic performance in automatic and human evaluations.",

    "translated_abstract": "针对人类化的对话系统，目前情感对话方法采用统一的神经网络联合模型情感和语义。这种策略由于情感和语义之间的相互限制往往会产生安全的响应，并且需要罕见的情感标注大规模对话语料库。受到人类对话中“三思而后语”的行为启发，我们提出了一种用于生成情感对话的两阶段对话代理。首先，一个没有使用情感标注对话语料库训练的对话模型生成符合上下文语义的原型响应。其次，第一阶段原型将通过一个可控的情感优化器与共情假设进行修改。在DailyDialog和EmpatheticDialogues数据集上的实验结果表明，我们提出的对话代理在情感生成方面优于比较模型，并在自动和人类评估中保持了语义表现。",
