    "translated_abstract": "实体匹配任务的难度取决于多个因素的组合，例如角落案例对的数量、训练集中未见过的实体的比例以及开发集的大小。目前的实体匹配基准通常代表这些维度上的单个点，或者提供了沿着单个维度评估匹配方法的可能性，例如训练数据量。本文介绍了WDC产品，这是一个实体匹配基准，它提供了对匹配系统在三个维度组合上的系统评估，同时依赖于真实世界的数据。这三个维度是(i) 角落案例的数量 (ii) 对未见实体的泛化能力，以及 (iii) 开发集的大小（训练集加验证集）。对未见实体的泛化能力是目前任何已有的英语基准所不包含的维度，但对于评估实体匹配的鲁棒性至关重要。",
