    "translated_abstract": "学习变量之间的因果关系是因果推断中的一项基本任务，有向无环图（DAGs）是表示因果关系的常见选择。由于我们只能从观测数据中恢复因果图的 Markov 等价类，因此通常需要使用干预来进行恢复任务。干预通常是昂贵的，因此设计能够最小化干预次数的算法非常重要。在这项工作中，我们研究了在学习一组边缘（目标边缘）之间的因果关系时，识别所需最小干预集的问题。在假设忠实性、因果充分性和理想干预的条件下，我们在两个设置下研究了这个问题：当底层真实因果图已知时（子集验证），以及当其未知时（子集搜索）。对于子集验证问题，我们提供了一个有效的算法来计算最小干预集；我们进一步解决了子集搜索问题，并提出了两种算法进行解决。",
