    "abstract": "Football is a very result-driven industry, with goals being rarer than in most sports, so having further parameters to judge the performance of teams and individuals is key. Expected Goals (xG) allow further insight than just a scoreline. To tackle the need for further analysis in football, this paper uses machine learning applications that are developed and applied to Football Event data. From the concept, a Binary Classification problem is created whereby a probabilistic valuation is outputted using Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting based approaches. The model successfully predicts xGs probability values for football players based on 15,575 shots. The proposed solution utilises StatsBomb as the data provider and an industry benchmark to tune the models in the right direction. The proposed ML solution for xG is further used to tackle the age-old cliche of: 'the ball has fallen to the wrong guy there'. The development of the model is used to adjust and gain more realistic value",

    "translated_abstract": "足球是一个非常结果驱动的行业，进球比大多数体育项目都更为罕见，因此，进一步评估团队和个人表现的参数非常关键。期望进球（xG）比仅有进球比分更能提供见解。为了解决足球中进一步分析的需求，本文使用机器学习应用程序开发并应用于足球事件数据。从该概念中，创建了一个二元分类问题，通过逻辑回归和基于梯度提升的方法输出概率估计值。该模型成功预测了基于15,575次射门的足球运动员的xG概率值。所提出的解决方案利用StatsBomb作为数据提供商，并将行业基准用于调整模型。提出的xG的机器学习解决方案进一步用于解决“球掉进了错误的人手里”的老话题。该模型的开发用于调整并获得更现实的价值。",
