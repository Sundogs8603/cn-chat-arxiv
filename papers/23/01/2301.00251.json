    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们提出了一种名为Forest-PLS的特征选择方法，用于分析政策效果的异质性。与传统方法相比，我们的方法更加灵活和全面，能够捕捉人群中基于可观察特征定义的子群内外的政策效果异质性。为了实现这一目标，我们采用偏最小二乘法来识别人群的目标组分，并利用因果森林来估计这些组分上的个性化政策效果。我们展示了该方法的一致性，并证明政策效果渐近地服从正态分布。为了验证我们方法的有效性，我们将其应用于1988年至1989年间在宾夕法尼亚州进行的重新就业奖励实验的数据。分析显示，财政激励可以激励一些年轻的非白人个体进入劳动市场。然而，这些激励也可能提供一种临时的财务缓冲",
