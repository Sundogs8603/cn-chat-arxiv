    "translated_abstract": "合成数据对于评估聚类技术、补充和扩展真实数据以及允许更完整地覆盖给定问题空间至关重要。而合成数据生成器具有创建大量数据的潜力，这在真实世界数据稀缺时至关重要，同时提供了一个被充分理解的生成过程和一个可解释的工具，以系统地研究聚类分析算法。在这里，我们提出了一个名为Clugen的模块化合成数据生成过程，能够使用任意分布创建支持线段的多维聚类。Clugen是开源的，有全面的单元测试和文档，并且适用于Python、R、Julia和MATLAB/Octave生态系统。我们证明了我们的方法可以在各个维度上产生丰富多样的结果，适合用于评估聚类算法，并有潜力成为各个领域中广泛使用的框架。",
