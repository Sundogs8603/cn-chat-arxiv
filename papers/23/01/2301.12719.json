    "translated_abstract": "机器学习方法在使用场景生成器开发内部模型方面变得越来越重要。在 Solvency 2 下，内部模型需要经过验证，一个重要问题是这些数据驱动模型的验证与传统理论模型的区别在哪些方面。以市场风险为例，我们讨论了两个额外的验证任务的必要性：一个是检查所使用风险因素之间的依赖关系，一个是检测不希望出现的记忆效应。第一个任务是必要的，因为在这种新方法中，依赖关系不是从金融数学理论中推导出来的。后一个任务出现在机器学习模型仅重复经验数据而不生成新场景的情况下。然后，这些措施被应用于基于机器学习的经济场景生成器。结果表明，在这个上下文中，这些措施导致了合理的结果，并且可以用于验证和模型优化。",
