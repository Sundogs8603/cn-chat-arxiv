    "translated_abstract": "作为智能交通系统的核心技术，交通流预测具有广泛的应用。交通流预测面临的基本挑战是有效地对交通数据中复杂的时空依赖关系进行建模。时空图神经网络（GNN）模型已成为解决这一问题的最具前景的方法之一。然而，基于GNN的模型在交通预测中存在三个主要限制：i）大多数方法以静态方式建模空间依赖关系，这限制了学习动态城市交通模式的能力；ii）大多数方法仅考虑短程空间信息，无法捕捉长程空间依赖关系；iii）这些方法忽略了交通状况在位置之间的传播存在时间延迟。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的考虑传播时延的动态远程Transformer，即PDFormer。",
