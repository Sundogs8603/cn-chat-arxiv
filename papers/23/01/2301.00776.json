    "translated_abstract": "对于锂离子电池的预测和健康管理（PHM），已建立了许多模型来描述其衰减过程。现有的经验或物理模型可以揭示有关衰减动态的重要信息。然而，目前还没有一种通用且灵活的方法来融合这些模型所代表的信息。物理感知神经网络（PINN）是一种将经验或物理动态模型与数据驱动模型相结合的高效工具。为了充分利用各种信息来源，我们提出了一种基于PINN的模型融合方案。通过开发半经验半物理的偏微分方程（PDE）来建模锂离子电池的衰减动态。当对动态了解较少时，我们利用数据驱动的深度隐藏物理模型（DeepHPM）来发现潜在的主导动态模型。然后将发现的动态信息与挖掘的信息进行融合。",
