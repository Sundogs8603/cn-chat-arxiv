    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种无网格的可扩展框架，用于求解一类包括时间相关的Fokker-Planck方程和Wasserstein梯度流在内的守恒性偏微分方程。主要观察是PDE解的时间变化速度场需要是自洽的：它必须满足一个包含相同速度场的概率流的不动点方程。我们使用迭代形式和有偏梯度估计器的方法，绕过了具有强大实证性能的重大计算障碍，而不是直接最小化不动点方程的残差。与现有方法相比，我们的方法不受时间或空间离散化的限制，涵盖了更广泛的PDEs，并且可以在高维情况下进行扩展。实验表明，当解析解可用时，我们的方法可以准确恢复解析解，并在高维情况下取得优越的性能。",
