    "abstract": "Neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor poisoning attacks, where the attackers maliciously poison the training set and insert triggers into the test input to change the prediction of the victim model. Existing defenses for backdoor attacks either provide no formal guarantees or come with expensive-to-compute and ineffective probabilistic guarantees. We present PECAN, an efficient and certified approach for defending against backdoor attacks. The key insight powering PECAN is to apply off-the-shelf test-time evasion certification techniques on a set of neural networks trained on disjoint partitions of the data. We evaluate PECAN on image classification and malware detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that PECAN can (1) significantly outperform the state-of-the-art certified backdoor defense, both in defense strength and efficiency, and (2) on real back-door attacks, PECAN can reduce attack success rate by order of magnitude when compared to a range of baselines from the litera",

    "translated_abstract": "神经网络容易受到后门攻击，攻击者恶意污染训练集并在测试输入中插入触发器以改变受害模型的预测结果。现有的后门攻击防御方法要么没有提供正式的保证，要么具有计算昂贵且无效的概率保证。我们提出了一种有效且经过认证的后门攻击防御方法PECAN。PECAN的核心洞见是在数据的不相交分区上训练一组神经网络，并应用现成的测试时间逃避认证技术。我们在图像分类和恶意软件检测数据集上评估了PECAN。结果表明PECAN在防御强度和效率方面显著优于现有的经过认证的后门防御方法，并且在真实后门攻击中，与文献中的一系列基线相比，PECAN可以将攻击成功率降低一个数量级。",
