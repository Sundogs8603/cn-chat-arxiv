    "translated_abstract": "大多数基于会话的推荐系统（SBRS）专注于从用户当前会话中观察到的项目中提取信息以预测下一个项目，忽略了影响用户选择项目的会话外原因（称为“外部会话原因”，OSCs）。 然而，这些原因在现实世界中广泛存在，很少有研究探讨它们在SBRS中的作用。 在此工作中，我们从因果推断的角度分析了SBRS中OSCs的因果关系和相关性。 我们发现OSCs本质上是SBRS中的混淆因素，这导致用于训练SBRS模型的数据中存在虚假的相关性。 为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的SBRS框架，称为COCO-SBRS（COunterfactual COllaborative Session-Based Recommender Systems），以学习SBRS中OSCs和用户-项目交互之间的因果关系。 COCO-SBRS首先采用自我监督方法通过设计每个用户原因的伪标签来预训练推荐模型。",
