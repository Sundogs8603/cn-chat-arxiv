    "translated_abstract": "人体的呼吸频率和呼吸模式传达了关于主体的身体和心理状态的重要信息。异常呼吸可能表明严重的健康问题，需要进一步诊断和治疗。使用非相干红外光的无线光波传感（LWS）在不引起隐私问题的情况下，显示了安全、隐蔽、高效和无创的人体呼吸监测的潜力。呼吸监测系统需要在不同类型的呼吸模式上进行训练，以识别呼吸异常。该系统还必须验证所收集的数据是否为呼吸波形，丢弃由外部干扰、用户移动或系统故障引起的任何错误数据。为了解决这些需求，本研究使用模拟人类呼吸模式的机器人，模拟了正常和不同类型的异常呼吸。然后，使用红外光波传感技术收集了时间序列呼吸数据。在此基础上，用三种机器学习算法进行了呼吸异常检测。",
