    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统广泛存在，但用户往往很难在推荐质量较差时进行控制和调整。这促使了会话式推荐系统(CRSs)的发展，通过自然语言反馈提供对推荐的控制。然而，构建会话式推荐系统需要包含用户话语和涵盖多样化偏好范围的项目的会话训练数据。使用传统方法如众包，这样的数据收集起来非常困难。我们在项目集推荐的背景下解决了这个问题，注意到这个任务受到越来越多关注，动机在于音乐、新闻和食谱推荐等使用案例。我们提出了一种新技术TalkTheWalk，通过利用广泛可获得的精心策划的项目收藏中的领域专业知识来合成逼真高质量的会话数据，并展示了如何将其转化为相应的项目集策划。",
