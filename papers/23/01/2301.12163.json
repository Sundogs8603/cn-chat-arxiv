Examples include assigning jobs to busy servers, students to crowded schools or crowded classes, commuters to congested routes, workers to crowded office spaces or to team projects etc... Congestion is anonymous (it only depends on the number n of agents in a given post). A canonical interpretation of ex ante fairness allows each agent to choose m post-specific caps on the congestion they tolerate: these requests are mutually feasible if and only if the sum of the caps is n. For ex post fairness we impose a competitive requirement close to envy freeness: taking the congestion profile as given each agent is assigned to one of her best posts. If a competitive assignment exists, it delivers unique congestion and welfare profiles and is also efficient and ex ante fair. In a fractional (randomised or time sharing) version of our model, a ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种公平高效的解决方案，将代理分配给面临拥塞的m个职位，当代理关心他们的职位及其拥塞时。例如，将工作分配给繁忙的服务器，将学生分配到拥挤的学校或拥挤的班级，将通勤者分配到拥挤的路线，将工人分配到拥挤的办公空间或团队项目等。拥塞是匿名的（它只取决于给定职位中代理数量n）。先前公平的一个典型解释允许每个代理选择特定于职位的拥塞容忍度上限m：仅当这些请求之和为n时，它们是相互可行的。对于后期公平，我们施加了一项要求，接近于无嫉妒自由：在给定拥塞配置的情况下，每个代理被分配到她最好的一个职位。如果存在竞争性分配，它会提供独特的拥塞和福利配置，并且也是有效和先前公平的。在我们模型的分数（随机或时间共享）版本中，",
