    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络(GNN)是处理图学习问题的流行模型，它在许多实际任务中表现出强大的实证性能。但是，其理论性质尚未完全阐明。在本文中，我们从GNN的表达能力角度研究了GNN是否可以利用图结构。在我们的分析中，我们考虑受隐藏（或潜在）节点特征控制的图生成过程，这些特征包含有关图结构的所有信息。这种框架的典型示例是从隐藏特征构建的kNN图。在我们的主要结果中，我们表明GNN可以仅从输入图中恢复出隐藏节点特征，即使所有节点特征，包括隐藏特征本身和任何间接提示都不可用。GNN可以进一步利用恢复的节点特征进行下游任务。这些结果表明，GNN可以完全利用图结构，从而可以使用图结构自身实现。",
