Our Conditional Self-Attention Imputation (CSAI) model, grounded in a transformer-based framework, introduces a conditional hidden state initialization tailored to the intricacies of medical time series data.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种新颖的方法来解决多变量时间序列中的缺失数据问题，特别关注医疗数据的复杂性。我们的条件自注意力插补（CSAI）模型以基于Transformer的框架为基础，引入了一种针对医疗时间序列数据细节的条件隐藏状态初始化方式。该方法与传统的插补技术不同，它特别针对医疗数据集中缺失数据分布的不平衡问题，这一关键问题常常被忽视。通过整合先进的知识嵌入和非均匀掩蔽策略，CSAI能够灵活适应电子健康记录（EHR）中缺失数据的不同模式。",
