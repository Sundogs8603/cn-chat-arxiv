    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一个新的定义，即在度量空间中，对于一个包含k个点的小集合R来说，“代表”更大集合的定义。给定要表示的集合V（例如，文档或选民），以及可能的代表集合C，我们的标准要求对于V的任意子集S，该子集包含V的theta分数，在R中的theta*k个最佳点的平均距离不应超过与它们与C中所有点的最佳theta*k点的平均距离相比超过一个因子gamma。该定义强化了比例公平和核心公平的概念，但与这些概念不同的是，它要求大的凝聚簇以比例表示它们的大小。由于存在实例，除非gamma是多项式级别的大，否则没有解存在，我们在资源增强框架中研究了这个概念，隐含地将大小为k的集合R的约束说明为其大小仅为k/alpha，其中alpha > 1。此外，受到选举应用的启发，我们最...",

    "en_tdlr": "In this paper, we propose a novel definition for \"representativeness\" of a small set in a metric space compared to a larger set. Our criterion ensures that the average distance between any subset of the larger set and its best representatives is not significantly worse than the average distance to the best representatives among all possible representatives. We also discuss the challenges and constraints in finding solutions to this problem, particularly in the context of elections."
