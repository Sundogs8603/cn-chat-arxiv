    "translated_abstract": "进行因果推理的能力被广泛视为智能的核心特征。本文研究了大型语言模型(LLMs)能否连贯地推理因果关系。现有的自然语言处理(NLP)工作主要关注评估LLMs中的常识因果推理，未能评估模型是否能够按照一组明确定义的形式规则执行因果推断。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新的NLP任务，自然语言中的因果推断，受到Judea Pearl等人提出的“因果推断引擎”的启发。我们构建了一个包含10K个样本的大型数据集CLadder，通过一种oracle因果推理引擎，基于一组因果图和查询(联合、干预和反事实)，得到符号问题和真实答案，并将其翻译为自然语言。我们对数据集上的多个LLMs进行评估，并引入和评估了一种定制的链式推理机制。",
