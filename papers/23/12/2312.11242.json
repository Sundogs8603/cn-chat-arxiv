    "translated_abstract": "最近基于LLM的文本到SQL方法通常在“巨大”的数据库和需要多步推理的复杂用户问题上遭受严重的性能下降。此外，大多数现有方法忽视了利用外部工具和模型协作的LLM的重要意义。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了MAC-SQL，一种新颖的基于LLM的多智能体协作框架。我们的框架包括一个核心分解器智能体，用于进行带有少样本思维链的文本到SQL生成，同时还有两个辅助智能体，利用外部工具或模型获取较小的子数据库并修正错误的SQL查询。分解器智能体与辅助智能体合作，根据需要激活，并可以扩展以适应新的特性或工具，以实现有效的文本到SQL解析。在我们的框架中，我们最初利用GPT-4作为强大的LLM骨干来完成所有智能体任务，以确定...",
