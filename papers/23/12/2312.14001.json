    "translated_abstract": "在面部验证系统中取得最先进的成果通常依赖于标记的训练数据的可用性，然而这往往很难获得大量。在这项研究中，我们提出了使用Siamese网络进行人脸识别的方法，消除了对标记的人脸图像的需求。我们通过有策略地利用负样本和最近邻对来建立正样本和负样本对，从而通过无监督的方法来生成训练对。该网络采用了一个VGG编码器，作为双分支Siamese网络进行训练。我们的主要目标是避免对标记的人脸图像数据的需求，因此提出了在完全无监督的方式下生成训练对的方法。正训练数据是根据其与指定锚点之间的最高余弦相似度得分在数据集中选择的，而负训练数据则以类似的方式确定，但从一个另外的数据集中选择。",
