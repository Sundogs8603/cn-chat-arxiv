    "abstract": "arXiv:2312.09313v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: While neural fields have made significant strides in view synthesis and scene reconstruction, editing them poses a formidable challenge due to their implicit encoding of geometry and texture information from multi-view inputs. In this paper, we introduce \\textsc{LatentEditor}, an innovative framework designed to empower users with the ability to perform precise and locally controlled editing of neural fields using text prompts. Leveraging denoising diffusion models, we successfully embed real-world scenes into the latent space, resulting in a faster and more adaptable NeRF backbone for editing compared to traditional methods. To enhance editing precision, we introduce a delta score to calculate the 2D mask in the latent space that serves as a guide for local modifications while preserving irrelevant regions. Our novel pixel-level scoring approach harnesses the power of InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) to discern the disparity between IP2",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管神经场在视图合成和场景重建方面取得了重要进展，但由于它们隐含地从多视图输入编码几何和纹理信息，编辑它们仍然是一个巨大挑战。在本文中，我们介绍了\\textsc{LatentEditor}，这是一个创新性框架，旨在赋予用户使用文本提示执行神经场的精确和局部受控编辑的能力。利用去噪扩散模型，我们成功地将真实世界场景嵌入潜在空间，从而相较于传统方法，对NeRF骨干进行更快更具适应性的编辑。为了增强编辑精度，我们引入了一个增量分数来计算潜在空间中的2D掩码，作为局部修改的指南，同时保留不相关区域。我们的新颖的像素级评分方法利用了InstructPix2Pix (IP2P)的能力，以辨别 IP2 之间的差异。",
