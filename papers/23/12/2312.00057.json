While probabilistic copyright protection methods provide a probabilistic guarantee against such infringement, in this paper, we introduce Virtually Assured Amplification Attack (VA3), a novel online attack framework that exposes the vulnerabilities of these protection mechanisms. The proposed framework significantly amplifies the probability of generating infringing content on the sustained interactions with generative models and a non-trivial lower-bound on the success probability of each engagement. Our theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under various scenarios.

    "translated_abstract": "随着文本到图像生成模型的广泛使用，人们开始担心它们产生侵犯版权内容的高风险。尽管概率版权保护方法提供了一种对抗侵权行为的概率性保证，但在本文中，我们介绍了一种名为Virtually Assured Amplification Attack (VA3)的新型在线攻击框架，揭示了这些保护机制的漏洞。提出的框架显著增加了在与生成模型持续交互的过程中产生侵权内容的概率，并对每次交互的成功概率提供了一个非平凡的下界。我们的理论和实验结果展示了我们方法在各种情况下的有效性。这些发现凸显了在文本到图像生成模型的实际应用中实施概率版权保护的潜在风险。",
