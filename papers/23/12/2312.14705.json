    "translated_abstract": "肺栓塞（PE）是一种常见的肺部疾病，严重时可导致右心室肥厚和衰竭，在严重程度上仅次于心肌梗死和猝死。肺动脉CT血管造影（CTPA）是一种广泛使用的PE诊断方法。然而，由于影像技术的局限性，PE的检测在临床实践中存在挑战。CTPA可能产生与PE类似的噪声，使得确认其存在变得耗时且容易出现过度诊断。然而，传统的PE分割方法无法充分考虑特征的分层结构、PE CT图像的局部和全局空间特征。在本文中，我们提出了一种自动的PE分割方法，称为SCUNet++（Swin Conv UNet++）。该方法在编码器和解码器之间引入了多重融合稠密跳跃连接，利用Swin Transformer作为编码器。并在解码器子网络中融合不同尺度的特征，以弥补特征的缺失。",
