    "translated_abstract": "最近，使用预训练语言模型（PLMs）进行提示调整已经展示出了显著的关系抽取（RE）任务的增强能力。然而，在低资源场景中，即训练数据有限的情况下，由于对关系的表层理解，先前基于提示的方法可能仍然表现不佳，用于表示学习。为此，我们强调在低资源场景中学习高质量关系表示对于RE的重要性，并提出了一种新的基于提示的关系表示方法，名为MVRE（多视角关系抽取），以更好地利用PLMs的能力来改善低资源提示调整范式下的RE性能。具体而言，MVRE将每个关系解耦为不同的视角，以包含多视角的关系表示，以最大化关系推断过程中的似然性。此外，我们还设计了一个全局性的低领域任务学习策略，以进一步提高关系表示的质量。",
