To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven, physically-informed deep-learning framework for classifying dynamical regimes and characterizing bifurcation boundaries based on the extraction of topologically invariant features. We focus on the paradigmatic case of the supercritical Hopf bifurcation, which is used to model periodic dynamics across a wide range of applications.

    "translated_abstract": "科学领域中的动力系统，从电路到生态网络，当其基本参数跨越阈值时，会发生质变和常发性的行为变化，称为分歧。现有方法能够预测单个系统中即将发生的灾难，但主要基于时间序列，并且在分类不同系统的定性动力学变化和推广到真实数据方面存在困难。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一个数据驱动的、基于物理信息的深度学习框架，用于对动力学变化进行分类并表征分歧边界的拓扑不变特征提取。我们专注于超临界霍普分歧的典型案例，其用于模拟广泛应用的周期性动力学。我们的卷积关注方法经过了数据增强训练，鼓励学习可以用于检测分歧边界的拓扑不变量。",
