    "translated_abstract": "文本到图像（T2I）模型在内容生成中的广泛应用需要仔细研究它们的安全性，包括它们对抗攻击的鲁棒性。尽管对抗攻击的研究已经很广泛，但其有效性的原因仍然未被深入探索。本文对T2I模型的对抗攻击进行了实证研究，重点分析了与攻击成功率（ASR）相关的因素。我们引入了一种新的攻击目标 - 使用对抗性后缀进行实体替换，以及两种基于梯度的攻击算法。人工和自动评估揭示了实体交换中ASR的不对称性质：例如，对于在提示“在雨中跳舞的人类”中替换“人类”为“机器人”的对抗性后缀，较容易实现，而反向替换则明显困难得多。我们进一步提出了探测指标，以确定模型对抗ASR的信号。我们发现了：",
