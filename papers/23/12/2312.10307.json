    "translated_abstract": "产生具有情感的音乐是自动音乐生成中的一个重要任务，情感通过各种随时间变化并相互协作的音乐元素（如音高和持续时间）来唤起。然而，以往基于深度学习的情感音乐生成研究很少探索不同音乐元素对情感的贡献，更不用说有意识地操纵这些元素来改变音乐的情感了，这不利于对情感进行细粒度的元素级控制。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，采用基于音乐元素的正则化处理在潜变量空间中解耦不同的元素，探究它们在区分情感中的作用，并进一步操纵元素来改变音乐的情感。具体而言，我们提出了一种名为MusER的基于VQ-VAE的模型。MusER在模型中引入了正则化损失，来约束音乐元素序列与特定情感之间的对应关系。",

This research fills the gap in existing studies on the contribution of musical elements in emotional music generation and provides a new approach for fine-grained emotion control."
