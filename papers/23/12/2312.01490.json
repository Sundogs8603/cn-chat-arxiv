Material-specific parameters are used by the formulation to control the garment inextensibility. This delivers unrealistic results with physically implausible stretching. Oftentimes, the draped garment is pushed inside the body which is either corrected by an expensive post-processing, thus adding to further inconsistent stretching; or by deploying a separate training regime for each body type, restricting its scalability. Additionally, the flawed skinning process deployed by existing methods produces incorrect results on loose garments. In this paper, we introduce a geometrical constraint to the existing formulation that is collision-aware and imposes garment inextensibility wherever possible.

    "translated_abstract": "近期神经网络、基于物理的模型可以更快速地展示服装变形，并且看起来更美观，相较于现有的方法。通过使用特定材质参数控制服装的不可伸缩性，这种配方产生了具有物理不可信伸展的不真实结果。经常被遮挡的服装被推到人体内部，这要么通过昂贵的后期处理被纠正，从而增加不一致的伸展；要么通过为每种体型部署独立的训练制度来进行修正，这限制了其可伸缩性。此外，现有方法部署的有缺陷的皮肤处理过程在松散的服装上产生不正确的结果。在本文中，我们向现有的配方引入了一个几何约束，它是碰撞感知的，并在可能的情况下强制服装不能伸展。因此，我们获得了现实的结果，其中遮挡的服装只在覆盖更大的身体时会伸展。",
