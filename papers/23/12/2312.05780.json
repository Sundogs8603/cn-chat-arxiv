Timely diagnosis and treatment can improve the quality of life for PD patients. However, access to clinical diagnosis is limited in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Therefore, development of automated screening tools for PD can have a huge social impact, particularly in the public health sector. In this paper, we present PULSAR, a novel method to screen for PD from webcam-recorded videos of the finger-tapping task from the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). PULSAR is trained and evaluated on data collected from 382 participants (183 self-reported as PD patients). We used an adaptive graph convolutional neural network to dynamically learn the spatio temporal graph edges specific to the finger-tapping task. We enhanced this idea with a multi stream adaptive convolution m",
