    "translated_abstract": "在过去几年里，随机梯度下降（SGD）算法的最终迭代收敛引起了人们的兴趣，因为它在实践中表现良好但缺乏理论理解。对于Lipschitz凸函数，不同的研究建立了最佳的$O(\\log(1/\\delta)\\log T/\\sqrt{T})$或$O(\\sqrt{\\log(1/\\delta)/T})$最终迭代的高概率收敛速率，其中$T$是时间跨度，$\\delta$是失败概率。然而，为了证明这些界限，所有现有的工作要么局限于紧致域，要么需要几乎肯定有界的噪声。很自然地会问，不需要这两个限制性假设的情况下，SGD的最终迭代是否仍然可以保证最佳的收敛速率。除了这个重要问题外，还有很多理论问题仍然没有答案。",
