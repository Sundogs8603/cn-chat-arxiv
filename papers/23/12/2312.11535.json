    "title": "Customize-It-3D: High-Quality 3D Creation from A Single Image Using Subject-Specific Knowledge Prior. (arXiv:2312.11535v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel two-stage approach that fully utilizes the information provided by the reference image to establish a customized knowledge prior for image-to-3D generation. While previous approaches primarily rely on a general diffusion prior, which struggles to yield consistent results with the reference image, we propose a subject-specific and multi-modal diffusion model. This model not only aids NeRF optimization by considering the shading mode for improved geometry but also enhances texture from the coarse results to achieve superior refinement. Both aspects contribute to faithfully aligning the 3D content with the subject. Extensive experiments showcase the superiority of our method, Customize-It-3D, outperforming previous works by a substantial margin. It produces faithful 360-degree reconstructions with impressive visual quality, making it well-suited for various applications, including text-to-3D creation.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了一种新的两阶段方法，充分利用参考图像提供的信息，建立图像到3D生成的自定义知识先验。之前的方法主要依赖于通用的扩散先验，这些方法在与参考图像得到一致结果方面存在困难，我们提出了一种主体特定且多模态的扩散模型。该模型不仅通过考虑阴影模式来改善几何优化和纹理增强的粗略结果，还有助于使3D内容与主题保持一致。大量实验证明了我们的方法的优越性，Customize-It-3D在视觉质量上远远超过了以前的方法，能够产生出色的360度重建结果，非常适合各种应用，包括文本到3D的创建。",
