    "abstract": "arXiv:2312.06185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer interactive APIs that can answer common questions at a human-expert level. However, these models often give inaccurate or incorrect responses when faced with questions requiring domain-specific or professional-specific knowledge not covered in their training corpus. Furthermore, many state-of-the-art LLMs are not open-source, making it challenging to inject knowledge with model APIs only. In this work, we introduce KnowGPT, a black-box knowledge injection framework for LLMs in question answering. KnowGPT leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) to extract relevant knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and use Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) to construct the most suitable prompt for each question. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets showcase that KnowGPT significantly enhances the existing methods. Notably, KnowGPT achieves an average improvement of 23.",

    "translated_title": "KnowGPT：大型语言模型的黑盒知识注入",
    "translated_abstract": "生成式大型语言模型（LLMs），如ChatGPT，提供互动式API，可以以人类专家水平回答常见问题。然而，当面临需要特定领域或专业领域知识的问题时，这些模型通常会给出不准确或不正确的响应，这些知识并未包含在它们的训练语料库中。此外，许多最先进的LLMs并非开源，这使得仅使用模型API注入知识具有挑战性。在本研究中，我们介绍了KnowGPT，一种用于LLMs在问答中的黑盒知识注入框架。KnowGPT利用深度强化学习（RL）从知识图中提取相关知识，并使用多臂老虎机（MAB）为每个问题构建最合适的提示。我们在三个基准数据集上进行了大量实验，展示了KnowGPT显著增强了现有方法。值得注意的是，KnowGPT平均改进了23%。",
