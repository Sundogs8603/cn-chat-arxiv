In this paper, we release SynFundus-1M, a high-quality synthetic dataset containing over one million fundus images in terms of \\textbf{eleven disease types}. Furthermore, we deliberately assign four readability labels to the key regions of the fundus images. To the best of our knowledge, SynFundus-1M is currently the largest fundus dataset with the most sophisticated annotations. Leveraging over 1.3 million private authentic fundus images from various scenarios, we trained a powerful Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model, named SynFundus-Generator. The released SynFundus-1M are generated by SynFundus-Generator under predefined conditions.
