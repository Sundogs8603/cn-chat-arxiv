Existing concept erasing methods in academia are all based on full parameter or specification-based fine-tuning, from which we observe the following issues: 1) Generation alternation towards erosion: Parameter drift during target elimination causes alternations and potential deformations across all generations, even eroding other concepts at varying degrees, which is more evident with multi-concept erased; 2) Transfer inability & deployment inefficiency: Previous model-specific erasure impedes the flexible combination of concepts and the training-free transfer towards other models, resulting in linear cost growth as the deployment scenarios increase.

    "translated_abstract": "由于商业和开源扩散模型（DMs）在文本到图像生成中的广泛应用，为防止不良行为，现有的概念擦除方法基于完全参数或基于规范的精细调整，观察到以下问题：1）不断侵蚀朝向的生成：目标消除过程中的参数漂移导致所有生成的变化和潜在变形，甚至在多概念消除时侵蚀其他概念，在不同程度上更加明显；2）转移能力和部署效率：之前基于模型的擦除阻碍了概念的灵活组合和训练免费转移到其他模型，导致部署场景增加时成本线性增长。为了实现无侵入、精确、可定制和可转移的消除，我们将擦除框架建立在一维基础上。",
    "tldr": "基于一维结构，该研究提出了一种新的擦除框架，旨在解决现有概念消除方法存在的问题，实现非侵入性、精确性、可定制性和可转移性。",
