    "abstract": "Human educators possess an intrinsic ability to anticipate and seek educational explanations from students, which drives them to pose thought-provoking questions when students cannot articulate these explanations independently. We aim to imbue Intelligent Tutoring Systems with this ability using few-shot learning capability of Large Language Models. Our work proposes a novel prompting technique, Assertion Enhanced Few-Shot Learning, to facilitate the generation of accurate, detailed oriented educational explanations. Our central hypothesis is that, in educational domain, few-shot demonstrations are necessary but not a sufficient condition for quality explanation generation. We conducted a study involving 12 in-service teachers, comparing our approach to Traditional Few-Shot Learning. The results show that Assertion Enhanced Few-Shot Learning improves explanation accuracy by 15% and yields higher-quality explanations, as evaluated by teachers. We also conduct a qualitative ablation stud",

    "translated_abstract": "人类教育者具备从学生中预测并寻求教育解释的内在能力，当学生无法独立表达这些解释时，他们能够提出发人深省的问题。我们的目标是利用大型语言模型的少样本学习能力为智能辅导系统赋予这种能力。我们的工作提出了一种新颖的教导技术，即强化断言的少样本学习，以促进准确、详细的教育解释的生成。我们的核心假设是，在教育领域，少样本演示是必要但不足以保证高质量的解释生成的条件。我们进行了一项涉及12名在职教师的研究，将我们的方法与传统的少样本学习进行了比较。结果显示，强化断言的少样本学习将解释准确性提高了15%，并得到了教师评估为高质量的解释。我们还进行了定性的剔除研究。",
