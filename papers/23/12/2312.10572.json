    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑到一种匿名多智能体路径规划（AMAPF）问题，其中智能体的集合被限制在一个图中，给定了一组目标顶点，并且每个顶点必须被某个智能体到达。该问题是找到目标与智能体的分配以及无碰撞路径，并且我们希望找到最优makespan的解。解决这个问题的一种成熟方法是将其转化为一种特殊类型的图搜索问题，即在输入图产生的辅助图上找到最大流问题。前者的大小可能非常大，搜索可能成为一个瓶颈。为此，我们提出了一种特定的搜索算法，借助了通过同时考虑一批搜索状态而不是单独考虑它们来探索搜索空间的想法。也就是说，我们将搜索状态的批量压缩、存储和展开成单个状态，从而实现高度减少",
