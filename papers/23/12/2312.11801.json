    "translated_abstract": "尽管半定规划(SDP)在传统上局限于中等规模的问题，但最近使用矩阵草图技术增强的算法已经能够解决更大的SDP问题。然而，这些方法在可扩展性方面取得了成功，但需要增加必要的迭代次数，导致随着问题规模的增长，收敛速度减慢。此外，它们还需要迭代相关的参数调度，限制了有效利用温暖启动初始化的能力，在具有增量到达数据或混合整数规划的实际应用中很重要。我们提出了统一的谱束缚与草图初始化(USBS)，这是一种可证明正确、快速、可扩展的算法，用于解决大规模的SDP问题，可以利用温暖启动初始化来进一步加速收敛。我们提出的算法是一种解决包含相等和不等式约束的一般SDP问题的谱束方法，此外，当结合可选的矩阵草图技术时",
