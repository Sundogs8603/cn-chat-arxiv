The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest that machines might also possess the aforementioned human-like capabilities, allowing them to exhibit powerful abilities even with a constrained parameter count. In this paper, we introduce KwaiAgents, a generalized information-seeking agent system based on LLMs. Within KwaiAgents, we propose an agent system that employs LLMs as its cognitive core, which is capable of understanding a user's query, behavior guidelines, and referencing external documents.

    "translated_abstract": "人类由于好奇心的驱使，不断探索和理解周围的世界，从而发明了各种工具来满足这种好奇心。尽管人类无法在大脑中处理和记忆大量信息，但在批判思维、规划、反思以及利用现有工具与世界进行交互和解释方面卓越出色，使其能够高效地寻找答案。最近大型语言模型（LLM）的进步表明，机器可能也具备类似于人类的能力，即使参数数量受限，也能展示强大的能力。在本文中，我们介绍了 KwaiAgents，这是一个基于LLM的通用信息搜索智能体系统。在 KwaiAgents 中，我们提出了一种利用LLM作为认知核心的智能体系统，它能够理解用户的查询、行为准则和参考外部文档。智能体还可以更新查询结果，与用户进行互动，并提供高质量的知识和信息。",
