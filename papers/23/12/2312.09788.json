    "translated_abstract": "领域泛化语义分割（DGSS）涉及在标记的源域上训练模型，旨在在推断过程中推广到未见过的领域。现有的DGSS方法通常通过域随机化（DR）实现强健特征。这种方法通常存在局限性，因为它只能考虑样式多样性而不是内容。在这项工作中，我们采用了一种正交的DGSS方法，即利用一系列协作基础模型用于领域泛化的语义分割（CLOUDS）。具体而言，CLOUDS是一个集成了各种基础模型的框架：（i）CLIP骨干用于其强健特征表示，（ii）生成模型用于使内容多样化，从而涵盖可能目标分布的各种模式，以及（iii）使用“Segment Anything Model”（SAM）迭代地改进分割模型预测。大量实验表明，我们的CLOUDS表现突出。",
