    "translated_abstract": "随着人类中心的自然语言处理研究的进展，人们越来越意识到将人类和社会因素纳入到自然语言处理模型的重要性。同时，我们的自然语言处理系统已经严重依赖于LLM，其中大多数并没有对作者进行建模。为了构建能够真正理解人类语言的自然语言处理系统，我们必须更好地将人类背景整合到LLM中。这提出了一系列设计考虑和挑战，涉及到要捕捉哪些人类因素、如何表示它们以及要采用何种建模策略等问题。为了应对这些挑战，我们提倡从心理学和行为科学的概念出发，支持三个立场来创建大型人类语言模型（LHLMs）：首先，语言模型训练应包括人类背景。其次，LHLMs应该意识到人不仅仅是他们所属的群体。第三，LHLMs应该能够考虑到人类背景的动态和时间依赖性特点。",
