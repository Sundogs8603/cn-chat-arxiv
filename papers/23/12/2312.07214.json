Recognizing the significance of this development, this paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) into human-robot teaming environments to facilitate variable autonomy through the means of verbal human-robot communication. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for such a GPT-powered multi-robot testbed environment, based on a Unity Virtual Reality (VR) setting. This system allows users to interact with robot agents through natural language, each powered by individual GPT cores. By means of OpenAI's function calling, we bridge the gap between unstructured natural language input and structure robot actions.

    "translated_abstract": "在一个快速发展的数字化环境中，自主工具和机器人正变得司空见惯。鉴于这一发展的重要性，本文探讨了将大型语言模型（LLMs）如生成式预训练变压器（GPT）集成到人机团队合作环境中，通过口头人机交流手段促进可变自主性。我们在Unity虚拟现实（VR）环境中，基于GPT核心为动力的多机器人测试台架环境中引入了一个新颖的框架。该系统允许用户通过自然语言与机器人代理进行交互，每个代理都由独立的GPT核心提供动力。通过OpenAI的函数调用，我们弥合了不受结构约束的自然语言输入和结构化机器人动作之间的差距。一项涉及12名参与者的用户研究探讨了GPT-4的有效性，更重要的是，当给予机会进行自然对话时用户的策略。",
