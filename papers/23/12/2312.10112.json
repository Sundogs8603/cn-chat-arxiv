    "translated_abstract": "建模和合成真实的sRGB噪声对于各种低级别视觉任务至关重要，例如构建用于训练图像去噪系统的数据集。真实sRGB噪声的分布极为复杂，并受多种因素影响，使得其准确建模极具挑战性。因此，最近的研究提出了采用数据驱动生成模型，如生成对抗网络（GAN）和正规化流的方法。这些研究相比传统的噪声建模方法实现了对sRGB噪声的更准确建模。然而，由于每种生成模型的固有特性，存在性能限制。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了NM-FlowGAN，这是一种利用GAN和正规化流的优势的混合方法。我们同时采用基于正规化流的像素级噪声建模网络，以及基于GAN的空间相关性建模网络。",
