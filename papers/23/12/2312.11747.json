    "translated_abstract": "反事实解释（CE）技术作为向与AI系统互动的用户提供洞察力的手段已引起关注。虽然在医学成像和自动驾驶等领域进行了广泛研究，但图形反事实解释（GCE）方法相对较少。 GCE生成一个类似于原始图形的新图形，其结果基于潜在的预测模型。在这些GCE技术中，尽管在其他领域如艺术风格和自然语言建模中取得了令人印象深刻的成就，但基于生成机制的解释器仍然受到了相对有限的研究。对生成解释器的偏好源于它们在推断期间生成反事实实例的能力，利用自动获取的输入图形的扰动。在上述理由的推动下，我们的研究介绍了RSGG-CE，一种新颖的鲁棒随机图生成器，用于反事实解释",
