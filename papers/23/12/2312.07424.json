    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习领域，针对分布转移的泛化能力——即部署条件与训练场景不一致的情况——至关重要，特别是在诸如气候建模、生物医学和自动驾驶等领域。基于广泛预训练和任务多样性而区别于其他模型的基础模型的出现，引发了对它们对分布转移的适应能力的增加兴趣。GPT-4V(ision)作为最先进的公开获取的多模式基础模型，在各个领域，包括异常检测、视频理解、图像生成和医学诊断等方面有广泛应用。然而，它对数据分布的稳健性仍然较少被探究。针对这一空白，本研究对GPT-4V在动态环境中的适应能力和泛化能力进行了严格评估，与CLIP、LLaVA和Gemini等知名模型进行了对比。",
