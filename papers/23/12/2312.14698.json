    "translated_abstract": "生成范式在机器学习和深度学习模型中变得越来越重要。其中流行的生成模型之一是正则化流，通过微分同胚变换将基本分布转变为准确估计的似然函数。将正则化流框架扩展到处理时间索引流产生动态正则化流，这是一种用于模拟时间序列、随机过程和神经随机微分方程(SDEs)的强大工具。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的动态正则化流变体，即时间变换正则化流(TCNF)，它基于布朗运动的时间变形，构成了一族多才多艺的高斯过程。这种方法使我们能够有效地模拟一些无法使用其他方法建模的SDEs，包括著名的奥恩斯坦-乌伦贝克过程以及泛化了先前的方法，从而提供了改进的结果和更好的推断和预测能力。",
