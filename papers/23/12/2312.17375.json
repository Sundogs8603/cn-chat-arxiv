    "translated_abstract": "对金融市场的深入理解需要了解不仅各实体之间的统计依赖关系，还需要了解因果依赖关系。该论文将基于约束的异构数据因果发现算法扩展到考虑时间序列数据中的滞后关系（我们称之为CD-NOTS算法），揭示不同金融资产和变量之间复杂的因果关系。我们比较了不同算法选择的性能，例如条件独立性测试的选择，以提供关于有效使用CD-NOTS的一般建议。利用模拟数据的结果，我们将CD-NOTS应用于各种指数和因子，以确定实体之间的因果关联，从而展示因果发现如何成为基于因子的投资、投资组合多样化和市场动态理解的有价值工具。此外，我们还展示了我们的算法是一个更有效的选择。",
