    "translated_abstract": "量子神经网络被认为是近期量子计算中的一种有前途的应用，但是在优化过程中面临着梯度消失以及受限制的Qubit数量和浅层电路导致表达能力有限的挑战。为了缓解这些问题，我们提出了一种分布式量子神经网络的方法，通过使用多个小电路逼近大电路的输出来进行预测。然而，逼近大电路需要指数级的小电路评估。因此，我们提出了将分割特征分布在多个小型量子神经网络上，并使用它们的期望值集合来生成预测。为了验证我们的分布式方法，我们进行了Semeion和MNIST手写数字数据集的十类分类实验。Semeion数据集的结果表明，我们的分布式方法在分类中可能优于单一的量子神经网络。",
