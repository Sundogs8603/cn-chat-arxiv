    "translated_abstract": "成员推断攻击（MIA）旨在检测特定数据点是否在训练机器学习模型时使用。最近一些强大的攻击具有较高的计算成本，并在不同条件下表现不一致，使它们对于实际的隐私风险评估不可靠。我们设计了一种新颖、高效且强大的成员推断攻击（RMIA），能够准确区分模型的总体数据和训练数据，同时计算开销最小。我们通过在似然比检验中更准确地建模零假设设置，并有效地利用来自总体的参考模型和参考数据样本，实现了这一目标。我们的算法在真正率（true-positive rate）方面表现出比先前方法更高的测试能力，整个TPR-FPR曲线都具备这种优势，即使在极低的误报率下（低至0）也是如此。在计算约束条件下，只有有限数量的情况下，",
