    "translated_abstract": "对抗性样本的可转移性对于基于转移的黑盒对抗攻击非常重要。之前生成可转移对抗性样本的工作集中在攻击给定的预训练替代模型上，而替代模型和对抗性可转移性之间的联系被忽视了。本文提出一种名为\"Lipschitz正则化替代模型\"（LRS）的转移黑盒攻击方法，该方法将替代模型转化为有利于对抗性可转移性的形式，使用这样转化后的替代模型，任何现有的基于转移的黑盒攻击都能够正常运行，且性能更好。具体来说，我们在替代模型的损失函数中引入Lipschitz正则化，以实现更平滑和可控的优化过程，生成更可转移的对抗性样本。此外，本文还阐明了替代模型内部属性与对抗性可转移性之间的关系。",
