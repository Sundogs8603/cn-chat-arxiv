    "abstract": "Humans' internal states play a key role in human-machine interaction, leading to the rise of human state estimation as a prominent field. Compared to swift state changes such as surprise and irritation, modeling gradual states like trust and satisfaction are further challenged by label sparsity: long time-series signals are usually associated with a single label, making it difficult to identify the critical span of state shifts. Windowing has been one widely-used technique to enable localized analysis of long time-series data. However, the performance of downstream models can be sensitive to the window size, and determining the optimal window size demands domain expertise and extensive search. To address this challenge, we propose a Selective Windowing Attention Network (SWAN), which employs window prompts and masked attention transformation to enable the selection of attended intervals with flexible lengths. We evaluate SWAN on the task of trust prediction on a new multimodal driving ",

    "translated_abstract": "人类的内部状态在人机交互中起着关键作用，引发了人类状态估计作为一个重要领域的兴起。相比于诸如惊讶和烦恼等快速状态变化，建模像信任和满意度这样渐进状态面临更大的挑战，因为标签稀疏性：长时间序列信号通常只与一个标签相关联，导致很难确定状态变化的关键时刻。窗口化是一种广泛使用的技术，用于对长时间序列数据进行局部分析。然而，下游模型的性能可能对窗口大小敏感，确定最佳窗口大小需要领域专业知识和大量搜索。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种选择性窗口化注意网络（SWAN），它使用窗口提示和掩码注意转换，以实现选择具有灵活长度的关注区间。我们在一个新的多模态驾驶信任预测任务上评估了SWAN。",
