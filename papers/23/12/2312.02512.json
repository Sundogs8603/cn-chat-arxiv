With the proposed AV2AV, two key advantages can be brought: 1) We can perform real-like conversations with individuals worldwide in a virtual meeting by utilizing our own primary languages. In contrast to Speech-to-Speech Translation (A2A), which solely translates between audio modalities, the proposed AV2AV directly translates between audio-visual speech. This capability enhances the dialogue experience by presenting synchronized lip movements along with the translated speech. 2) We can improve the robustness of the spoken language translation system. By employing the complementary information of audio-visual speech, the system can effectively translate spoken language even in the presence of acoustic noise, showcasing robust perfor",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的直接音视频语音到音视频语音转换（AV2AV）框架，其中系统的输入和输出是多模态的（即音频和视觉语音）。通过所提出的AV2AV，可以带来两个关键优势：1）我们可以利用自己的主要语言在虚拟会议中与全球个人进行类似真实的对话。与仅在音频模态之间进行翻译的语音到语音翻译（A2A）相比，所提出的AV2AV直接在音视频语音之间进行翻译。这种能力通过呈现与已翻译语音同步的嘴唇运动增强了对话体验。2）我们可以提高口译语言翻译系统的鲁棒性。通过使用音视频语音的互补信息，系统可以在存在声学噪声的情况下有效地翻译口头语言，展示出强大的性能。",
