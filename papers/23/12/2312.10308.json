In this paper, we introduce Event-Based Contrastive Learning (EBCL), a method for learning embeddings of heterogeneous patient data that preserves temporal information before and after key index events. We demonstrate that EBCL produces models that yield better fine-tuning performance on critical downstream tasks for a heart failure cohort, including 30-day readmission, 1-year mortality, and 1-week length of stay, relative to other pretraining methods.

    "translated_abstract": "在临床实践中，我们经常需要确定某个关键医学事件后患者是否处于不良结果的高风险状态，例如心力衰竭入院后的短期死亡风险。这个任务由于长期医学数据的复杂性、变异性和异质性而具有挑战性，特别是对于像心力衰竭这样的慢性疾病患者。在本文中，我们引入了基于事件的对比学习（EBCL）方法，用于学习不同类型患者数据的嵌入表示，以保留关键索引事件前后的时间信息。我们证明，相对于其他预训练方法，EBCL产生的模型在心力衰竭队列的关键下游任务（包括30天再入院、1年死亡率和1周住院天数）的微调性能更好。我们的研究还揭示了EBCL预训练单独能够有效地将具有相似死亡率和再入院风险的患者进行聚类，从而提供了新的见解。",
