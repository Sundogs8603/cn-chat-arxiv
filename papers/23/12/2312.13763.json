    "translated_abstract": "文本引导的扩散模型已经在图像和视频生成领域取得了革命性的进展，并且在基于优化的3D对象合成方面也取得了成功。在这里，我们将重点放在了尚未充分探索的文本到4D对象的设置上，并使用分数蒸馏方法合成具有额外时间维度的动态的、动画的3D对象。与以往的工作相比，我们采用了一种新颖的组合生成方法，并将文本到图像、文本到视频和3D感知多视图扩散模型结合起来，在4D对象优化过程中提供反馈，从而同时实现时间一致性、高质量的视觉效果和逼真的几何特征。我们的方法称为Align Your Gaussians（AYG），利用了带有形变场的动态三维高斯簇进行4D表示。AYG的关键在于一种用来规范移动的三维高斯分布的新方法，从而稳定优化过程并引导运动。我们还提出了一种运动放大机制，使得模型能够更好地捕捉到运动。",
