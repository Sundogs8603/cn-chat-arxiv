Tight monitoring is crucial for achieving high precision at a lower cost. Obtaining HI labels in real-world applications is often cost-prohibitive, requiring continuous, precise health measurements. Therefore, it is more convenient to leverage run-to failure datasets that may provide potential indications of machine wear condition, making it necessary to apply semi-supervised tools for HI construction. In this study, we adapt the Deep Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection (DeepSAD) method for HI construction. We use the DeepSAD embedding as a condition indicators to address interpretability challenges and sensitivity to system-specific factors. Then, we introduce a diversity loss to enrich condition indicators. We employ an alternating projection algorit",
