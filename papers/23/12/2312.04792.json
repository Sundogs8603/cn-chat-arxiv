    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在具有大量动作的重复游戏中实现遗憾最小化。这种游戏在通过辩论确保AI安全的环境中是固有的，并且更一般地应用于动作基于语言的游戏中。现有的在线游戏算法需要多项式计算数量的动作，而对于大型游戏来说，这可能是难以实现的。因此，我们考虑使用基于Oracle的算法，因为Oracle自然地模拟了对AI代理的访问。通过对Oracle访问进行特征化，我们可以有效地实现内部和外部遗憾的最小化。我们提出了一种新颖的内部遗憾最小化算法，其遗憾和计算复杂度对数地依赖于动作数量。这意味着可以高效地基于Oracle计算大型游戏中的相关均衡。最后，我们通过在AI安全辩论环境中进行实验，展示了我们算法分析的好处。",
