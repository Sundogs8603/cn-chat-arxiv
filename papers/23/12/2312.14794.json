    "translated_abstract": "欧盟平台对企业（P2B）规例的遵守对在线平台来说是具有挑战性的，而公共机构评估其合规性也可能存在困难。部分原因是缺乏自动化工具来评估平台提供的关于排名透明度的信息（例如，软件文档）。我们的研究以两种方式解决了这个问题。首先，我们对六个主要平台（Amazon，Bing，Booking，Google，Tripadvisor和Yahoo）的合规性进行了实证评估，揭示了它们的文档中存在重大差异。其次，我们引入并测试了基于ChatGPT和信息检索技术的自动合规性评估工具。这些工具与人工判断进行了评估，结果显示它们作为合规性评估的可靠代理的前景很有希望。我们的发现可以帮助提升监管合规性，并与联合国可持续发展目标10.3保持一致，该目标旨在减少包括商业差距在内的不平等。",
