    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLM）驱动的AI智能体取得了重大突破，使其能够在各种复杂任务中协助人类，引发了人机协作革命。LLM驱动的智能体通常需要调用LLM API并使用人工设计的复杂提示，导致推理延迟较高。尽管这种模式在最小互动要求的情境下（如代码生成）效果良好，但对于高度互动和实时应用（如游戏）则不适用。传统的游戏AI通常使用小模型或反应策略，可以实现快速推理，但任务完成和交互能力有限。本研究以Overcooked作为我们的测试场景，其中玩家可以使用自然语言进行交流并合作完成订单。我们提出了一种分层语言智能体（HLA）用于人机协作，既提供强大的推理能力又保持实时执行。具体而言，HLA采用了改进的LLM引擎和分层策略，以实现高效的交互和任务完成。",
