However, there is little fine-grained analysis on how label smoothing enhances text sentiment classification. To fill in the gap, this article performs a set of in-depth analyses on eight datasets for text sentiment classification and three deep learning architectures: TextCNN, BERT, and RoBERTa, under two learning schemes: training from scratch and fine-tuning. By tuning the smoothing parameters, we can achieve improved performance on almost all datasets for each model architecture. We further investigate the benefits of label smoothing, finding that label smoothing can accelerate the convergence of deep models and make samples of different labels easily distinguishable.",

    "translated_abstract": "标签平滑是一种广泛应用于各个领域的技术，如文本分类、图像分类和语音识别，以有效对抗模型过拟合而闻名。然而，对于标签平滑如何增强文本情感分类的细致分析却很少。为了填补这一空白，本文在八个文本情感分类数据集和三种深度学习架构（TextCNN、BERT和RoBERTa）以及两种学习方案下进行了一系列深入分析。通过调整平滑参数，我们可以在每个模型架构的几乎所有数据集上实现性能提升。我们进一步研究了标签平滑的好处，发现标签平滑可以加速深度模型的收敛，并使不同标签的样本更容易区分。",
