    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑合成对照方法（SCMs）的设定，这是一种在面板数据环境中估计被治疗对象的治疗效应的经典方法。我们揭示了SCMs中经常被忽视但普遍存在的“重叠”假设：一个被治疗的单位可以被写成保持控制的单位的某种组合（通常是凸或线性组合）。我们展示了如果单位选择自己的干预措施，并且单位之间的异质性足够大，以至于他们偏好不同的干预措施，重叠将不成立。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个框架，通过激励具有不同偏好的单位来采取他们通常不会考虑的干预措施。具体来说，我们利用信息设计和在线学习的工具，提出了一种SCM，通过为单位提供与激励相容的干预建议，在面板数据环境中激励探索。",
