    "abstract": "We propose a Reinforcement-Learning-based system that would automatically prescribe a hypothetical patient medication that may help the patient with their mental-health-related speech disfluency, and adjust the medication and the dosages in response to zero-cost frequent measurement of the fluency of the patient. We demonstrate the components of the system: a module that detects and evaluates speech disfluency on a large dataset we built, and a Reinforcement Learning algorithm that automatically finds good combinations of medications. To support the two modules, we collect data on the effect of psychiatric medications for speech disfluency from the literature, and build a plausible patient simulation system. We demonstrate that the Reinforcement Learning system is, under some circumstances, able to converge to a good medication regime. We collect and label a dataset of people with possible speech disfluency and demonstrate our methods using that dataset. Our work is a proof of concept:",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于强化学习的系统，该系统可以自动为患有与心理健康相关的言语不流畅的虚拟患者开具药物处方，并根据零成本频繁测量结果，调整药物和剂量。我们展示了系统的两个组成部分：一个在我们构建的大型数据集上检测和评估言语不流畅的模块，以及一个可以自动找到良好药物组合的强化学习算法。为了支持这两个模块，我们从文献中收集了关于药物治疗言语不流畅的效果的数据，并建立了一个可信的患者模拟系统。我们证明了在某些情况下，强化学习系统能够收敛到一个良好的用药方案。我们收集并对可能存在言语不流畅的人群进行了数据标注，并使用该数据集演示了我们的方法。我们的工作是一个概念验证:",
