    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) in audio holds significant potential across various domains, particularly in situations where abundant, unlabeled data is readily available at no cost. This is particularly pertinent in bioacoustics, where biologists routinely collect extensive sound datasets from the natural environment. In this study, we demonstrate that SSL is capable of acquiring meaningful representations of bird sounds from audio recordings without the need for annotations. Our experiments showcase that these learned representations exhibit the capacity to generalize to new bird species in few-shot learning (FSL) scenarios. Additionally, we show that selecting windows with high bird activation for self-supervised learning, using a pretrained audio neural network, significantly enhances the quality of the learned representations.",

    "translated_abstract": "音频中的自监督学习（SSL）在各个领域有着巨大的潜力，尤其是在存在大量无标签数据的情况下。这在生物声学领域尤为重要，生物学家经常从自然环境中收集大量的声音数据集。本研究证明了无需标注就能够从音频录音中获得有意义的鸟鸣表示的自监督学习的能力。我们的实验显示，这些学习到的表示能够在少样本学习（FSL）场景中泛化到新的鸟类。此外，我们还展示了使用预训练的音频神经网络选择高鸟活跃的窗口进行自监督学习可以显著提升学习表示的质量。",
