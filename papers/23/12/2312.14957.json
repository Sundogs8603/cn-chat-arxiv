    "translated_abstract": "基于会话的推荐旨在根据用户最近的用户-物品交互序列动态地向用户推荐物品。大多数现有的基于会话的推荐研究采用先进的深度学习方法。然而，大多数研究只考虑了一种特殊的行为类型（如点击），而那些考虑多种类型行为的研究则忽视了充分利用产品之间关系的机会。因此，本文提出了一种新的方法，称为基于多行为数据的可替代和互补关系（简称SCRM），以更好地探索产品之间的关系进行有效的推荐。具体来说，我们首先根据用户在每个会话中的顺序行为共同考虑“点击”和“购买”行为，构建可替代和互补的图。然后，我们设计了一个去噪网络来消除错误关系，并通过一个特别设计的损失函数进一步考虑这两个关系的约束。",
