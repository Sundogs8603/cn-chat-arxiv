    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个新颖的GPU相位折叠和卷积神经网络（CNN）系统GPFC，用于利用凌日方法探测系外行星。我们设计了一个在GPU上并行化的快速折叠算法，用于放大低信噪比的凌日信号，从而实现高精度和高速搜索。一个在两百万个合成光变曲线上训练的CNN会在每个周期上报告一个表明行星信号可能性的分数。虽然GPFC方法在周期范围上适用广泛，但此研究专注于探测轨道周期小于一天的超短周期行星。GPFC在速度上比主要的盒式最小二乘（BLS）方法提高了三个数量级。我们的模拟结果表明，与BLS相比，GPFC在训练准确率为97%、在相同假阳性率下真正阳性率更高、在相同召回率下精确度更高。",
