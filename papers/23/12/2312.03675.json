    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了GeoShapley，这是一种衡量机器学习模型中空间效应的博弈论方法。GeoShapley通过将位置概念化为模型预测博弈中的一名玩家，扩展了博弈论中的Nobel Prize-winning Shapley值框架，从而使得可以量化位置的重要性以及位置与模型中其他特征之间的协同作用。GeoShapley是一种与模型无关的方法，可以应用于不同结构的统计学或黑盒机器学习模型中。GeoShapley的解释直接与用于解释空间效应的空间变化系数模型以及用于解释非空间效应的加法模型相连。利用模拟数据，验证了GeoShapley值与已知数据生成过程之间的关系，并用于对比七种统计学和机器学习模型。通过房价建模的实证示例来说明。",
