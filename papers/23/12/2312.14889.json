    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们重新审视了分区分类的经典方法，并研究了在放宽条件下的收敛速率，包括可观测（非私密）和私密数据。我们假设特征向量$X$取值于$\\mathbb{R}^d$，其标签为$Y$。之前关于分区分类器的结果基于强密度假设，这种假设限制较大，我们通过简单的例子加以证明。我们假设$X$的分布是绝对连续分布和离散分布的混合体，其中绝对连续分量集中于一个$d_a$维子空间。在这里，我们在更宽松的条件下研究了这个问题：除了标准的Lipschitz和边际条件外，我们还引入了绝对连续分量的一个新特性，通过该特性计算了分类错误概率的精确收敛率，对于...",
