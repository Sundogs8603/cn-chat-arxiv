    "translated_abstract": "图数据固有复杂且异构，导致自然多样性的分布变化很高。然而，如何构建能够在真实世界中普遍适用于复杂非合成分布变化的机器学习架构仍不清楚。在这里，我们开发了GraphMETRO，一种图神经网络架构，可可靠地建模自然多样性并捕捉复杂的分布变化。GraphMETRO采用了一种混合专家（MoE）架构，其中包含一个门控模型和多个专家模型，每个专家模型针对特定的分布变化产生不变表示，门控模型则识别变化组件。此外，我们设计了一种新颖的目标函数，将不同专家模型的表示进行对齐以确保平滑优化。GraphMETRO在由复杂和自然的真实世界分布变化组成的GOOD基准测试的四个数据集上取得了最先进的结果，提高了67％。",
