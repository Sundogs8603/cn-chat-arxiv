    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了选区规划问题（gerrymandering）的计算复杂性。数学上，选区设计者（gerrymanderer）试图将一个加权图划分为$k$个连通分量（选区），以使其候选人（政党）赢得尽可能多的选区。之前的工作主要关注图是路径或树的特殊情况。我们的研究重点是图是平面图的实际情况。我们证明了在$\\lambda$-外平面图中，当候选人数和$\\lambda$是常数，顶点权重（投票权重）是多项式界限时，选区规划问题可以在多项式时间内解决。相反，在一般的平面图中，即使只有两个候选人，该问题也是NP完全的。这促使我们研究选区规划平面图的近似算法。然而，当候选人数较大时，我们证明很难区分选区设计者可以从这些项中脱颖而出的情况。",
