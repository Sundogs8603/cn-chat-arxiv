    "translated_abstract": "直接从广泛可得的嗪和嘧啶法染色全切片图像中预测人类表皮生长因子受体2（HER2）状态可以降低技术成本，加快治疗选择速度。准确预测HER2需要大量的多地点全切片图像。联邦学习可以在不传输千兆字节大小的全切片图像和数据隐私问题的情况下，协同训练这些全切片图像。然而，联邦学习在解决真实世界中多地点全切片图像的标签不平衡方面面临挑战。此外，现有的全切片图像分类方法不能同时利用联邦学习中站点端特征表示中的局部上下文信息和长程依赖关系。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种使用点变换器结合联邦学习从嗪和嘧啶法染色全切片图像中预测多地点HER2状态的方法。我们的方法包括两项新设计。我们提出了一种动态标签分布策略和一个辅助分类器。",
