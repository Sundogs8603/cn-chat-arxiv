In this work, we consider a retiree with potentially differing appetites for the key financial risks of decumulation: liquidity risk and investment risk. We set out to determine whether these differing risk appetites have a significant impact on the retiree's optimal choice of decumulation strategy. To do so, we design and implement a framework which selects the optimal decumulation strategy from a general set of admissible strategies in line with a retiree's goals, and under differing appetites for the key risks of decumulation.   Overall, we find significant evidence to suggest that a retiree's differing appetites for different decumulation risks will impact their optimal choice of strategy at retirement.

    "translated_abstract": "退休者对风险的偏好是传统上用于寻找退休储蓄去累积最佳策略的终身效用模型的常见输入。本文考虑了退休者对去累积的关键金融风险-流动性风险和投资风险可能有不同的偏好。我们旨在确定这些不同的风险偏好是否会对退休者的最佳去累积策略选择产生显著影响。为此，我们设计并实施一个框架，根据退休者的目标和对去累积的关键风险的不同偏好，从一般的可允许策略集中选择最佳的去累积策略。总体而言，我们发现有显著证据表明，退休者对不同去累积风险的不同偏好将影响他们在退休时的最佳策略选择。",
