We conceptualise this degradation by considering the type of non-response present in the data, demonstrating that biased non-response is particularly detrimental to model performance. We argue that biased non-response is likely in contexts where the labelling process, by nature, relies on user interactions. To mitigate the impact of biased non-response, we propose a cost-based correction to the sampling strategy--the Upper Confidence Bound of the Expected Utility (UCB-EU)--that can, plausibly, be applied to any active learning algorithm.

    "translated_abstract": "主动学习可以通过识别获取最具信息量的新标签来提高训练预测模型的效率。然而，在标签请求的非响应情况下，会影响主动学习在实际环境中的有效性。我们通过考虑数据中存在的非响应类型来概念化这种退化，证明偏倧的非响应对模型性能特别有害。我们认为，在标签过程天然依赖用户交互的环境中，偏倧的非响应很可能会出现。为了减轻偏倧的非响应影响，我们提出了一种基于成本的修正采样策略——预期效用的上界置信度（UCB-EU）, 这种方法可以合理地应用于任何主动学习算法。通过实验证明，我们的方法成功地减少了在许多场景中标签非响应造成的伤害。",
