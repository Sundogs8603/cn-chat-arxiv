The question of how to discover and link duplicate posts has garnered the attention of both developer communities and researchers.

    "translated_abstract": "技术在线社区的一个目标是帮助开发者在一个地方找到正确答案。一个问题可以以不同的方式和措辞被提出，导致技术论坛上存在重复帖子。如何发现和链接重复帖子引起开发者社区和研究人员的关注。例如，Stack Overflow采用基于投票的机制来标记和关闭重复帖子。然而，及时处理这些不断出现的重复帖子仍然具有挑战性。因此，已经提出了各种方法来自动检测技术论坛帖子中的重复帖子。现有方法存在局限性，要么依赖于手工制作的相似性度量，无法充分捕捉帖子的语义，要么缺乏监督以提高性能。",
