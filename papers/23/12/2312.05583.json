    "translated_abstract": "最近，神经网络已被广泛应用于解决物理系统建模中的偏微分方程（PDEs）。虽然主要研究集中在学习预定义静态网格离散化上的系统演化，但一些方法利用强化学习或监督学习技术来创建适应性和动态网格，由于这些系统的动态特性。然而，这些方法面临两个主要挑战：（1）需要昂贵的最佳网格数据，和（2）在网格细化过程中解决空间的自由度和拓扑结构的变化。为了解决这些挑战，本文提出了一种带有神经网格适配器的神经PDE求解器。首先，我们介绍了一种新颖的无数据神经网格适配器，称为Data-free Mesh Mover（DMM），具有两个主要创新点。首先，它是一个操作符，将解映射到自适应网格上，并使用Monge-Amp\\`ere方程进行训练。",
