    "abstract": "Despite increasing awareness and research around fake news, there is still a significant need for datasets that specifically target racial slurs and biases within North American political speeches. This is particulary important in the context of upcoming North American elections. This study introduces a comprehensive dataset that illuminates these critical aspects of misinformation. To develop this fake news dataset, we scraped and built a corpus of 40,000 news articles about political discourses in North America. A portion of this dataset (4000) was then carefully annotated, using a blend of advanced language models and human verification methods. We have made both these datasets openly available to the research community and have conducted benchmarking on the annotated data to demonstrate its utility. We release the best-performing language model along with data. We encourage researchers and developers to make use of this dataset and contribute to this ongoing initiative.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管对假新闻的认识和研究越来越多，但在北美政治演讲中特定针对种族侮辱和偏见的数据集仍然很有必要。这在即将举行的北美选举的背景下尤为重要。本研究介绍了一个全面的数据集，揭示了这些误导信息的关键方面。为了开发这个假新闻数据集，我们收集并建立了一个包含4万篇北美政治演讲新闻文章的语料库。其中的一部分数据集（4000篇）经过仔细注释，采用了先进的语言模型和人工验证方法的融合。我们已经将这两个数据集公开提供给研究界，并在注释数据上进行了性能基准测试以展示其实用性。我们发布了表现最佳的语言模型以及数据。我们鼓励研究人员和开发者使用这个数据集，并为这一持续进行的倡议做出贡献。",
