    "translated_abstract": "用于监控和道路交通的高清（HD）摄像头经历了巨大的增长，实时分析需要大量的计算资源。最近，将帧从前端设备卸载到后端边缘服务器已经显示出了很大的潜力。在多流竞争环境下，高效的带宽管理和适当的调度对于保证推理准确性和吞吐量非常重要。为了实现这个目标，我们提出了BiSwift，一种双级框架，通过集成多级流水线的创新自适应混合编解码器和全局带宽控制器来扩展并发实时视频分析，并为多个视频流提供优化的调度。低级别的前后端协同机制（称为自适应混合编解码器）在本地优化准确性和加速单个流的端到端视频分析。上层调度器通过全局带宽控制器，旨在实现多个流之间的准确性公平性。",
