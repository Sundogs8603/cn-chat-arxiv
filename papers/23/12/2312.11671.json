    "translated_abstract": "在这篇报告中，我们探索了语言模型代理在野外获取资源、复制自身和适应新挑战的能力。我们称这些能力为\"自主复制和适应\"或者ARA。我们认为具备ARA能力的系统可能具有广泛而难以预测的后果，并且对于衡量和预测ARA能力可能有助于制定相关的安全、监测和对齐措施。此外，一旦系统具备ARA能力，对系统能力的限制可能变得更加困难。我们构建了四个简单的示例代理，将语言模型与允许其在世界中采取行动的工具相结合。然后，我们对这些代理在与ARA相关的12个任务上进行评估。我们发现这些语言模型代理只能完成任务列表中最简单的任务，尽管对于更具挑战性的任务也有一定的进展。不幸的是，这些评估还没有完成。",
