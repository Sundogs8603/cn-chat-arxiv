    "translated_abstract": "基于当前大型语言模型的代理程序常常以一种类似树状的方式在探索-评估框架内推理，导航问题解决过程。然而，这些方法经常忽略一旦问题解决就可以舍弃的成功推理轨迹，从而导致这些轨迹在未来类似问题中被低效利用。为了解决这种低效率，我们采用了状态机来记录来自先前推理轨迹的经验。在状态机内，状态代表了细分的子问题，而状态转换反映了子问题之间的依赖关系。状态机记录了成功和失败的轨迹。利用状态机的经验，我们提出的思维状态机（SMoT）选择最优的子解决方案并避免错误的解决方案。我们的实验表明，SMoT可以显著改善在两种探索密集型问题中的问题解决能力：24",
