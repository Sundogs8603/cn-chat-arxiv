    "translated_abstract": "跨领域点击率（CDCTR）预测是一个重要的研究课题，研究如何利用相关领域的有意义数据来帮助目标领域的点击率预测。大多数现有的CDCTR作品设计了隐式的方式来跨领域传递知识，比如参数共享，用于规范化目标域中的模型训练。更有效地，最近的研究人员提出了显式技术来提取用户兴趣知识并将此知识转移到目标领域。然而，所提出的方法主要面临两个问题：1）通常需要一个超级领域，即一个非常大的源领域，来涵盖目标领域的大多数用户或项目，2）提取的用户兴趣知识是静态的，无论目标域中的场景如何。这些限制激励我们开发一种更灵活、更高效的技术来显式地转移知识。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种跨领域增强网络（CDA）",
