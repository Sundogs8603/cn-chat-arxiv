    "abstract": "The difficulty of the information extraction task lies in dealing with the task-specific label schemas and heterogeneous data structures. Recent work has proposed methods based on large language models to uniformly model different information extraction tasks. However, these existing methods are deficient in their information extraction capabilities for Chinese languages other than English. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end chat-enhanced instruction tuning framework for universal information extraction (YAYI-UIE), which supports both Chinese and English. Specifically, we utilize dialogue data and information extraction data to enhance the information extraction performance jointly. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on Chinese datasets while also achieving comparable performance on English datasets under both supervised settings and zero-shot settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "信息抽取任务的难点在于处理特定任务的标签模式和异构数据结构。最近的工作提出了基于大型语言模型的方法来统一建模不同的信息抽取任务。然而，这些现有方法在除了英语以外的中文语言的信息提取能力上存在不足。在本文中，我们提出了一个端到端的增强对话指导的通用信息抽取调优框架（YAYI-UIE），支持中文和英文。具体而言，我们利用对话数据和信息抽取数据共同增强信息抽取性能。实验结果表明，我们提出的框架在中文数据集上达到了业界领先的性能，同时在有监督和零样本设置下在英文数据集上也达到了可比较的性能。",
