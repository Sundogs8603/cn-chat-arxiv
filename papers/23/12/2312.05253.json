    "translated_abstract": "结构化（类似字典的）数据对于从左到右的语言模型来说带来了挑战，因为它们可能因为格式和属性呈现的顺序的敏感性而难以处理结构化实体。标签生成模型面临着一系列不同的限制，比如缺乏灵活性。我们介绍了用于结构化数据的Diffusion Models of Structured Knowledge（DiSK） - 一种新的体系结构和训练方法。DiSK使用高斯混合模型方法处理文本、分类和连续数值数据，这样可以在处理数字时提高精确度。它采用扩散训练来建模属性之间的关系。实验表明，DiSK在超过15个不同领域的数据集上对表格数据建模、合成和填充具有最先进的性能。DiSK为生成建模和操作结构化数据提供了有效的归纳偏差。这一技术",
