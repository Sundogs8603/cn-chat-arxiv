    "abstract": "arXiv:2312.08274v4 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Objective: To develop a high-throughput biomedical relation extraction system that takes advantage of the large language models'(LLMs) reading comprehension ability and biomedical world knowledge in a scalable and evidential manner. Methods: We formulate the relation extraction task as binary classifications for large language models. Specifically, LLMs make the decision based on the external corpus and its world knowledge, giving the reason for the judgment for factual verification. This method is tailored for semi-structured web articles, wherein we designate the main title as the tail entity and explicitly incorporate it into the context, and the potential head entities are matched based on a biomedical thesaurus. Moreover, lengthy contents are sliced into text chunks, embedded, and retrieved with additional embedding models. Results: Using an open-source LLM, we extracted 248659 relation triplets of three distinct relation ",

    "translated_abstract": "旨在开发一种利用大型语言模型的阅读理解能力和生物医学世界知识以可扩展和有信服力的方式进行高通量生物医学关系提取的系统。我们将关系提取任务制定为大型语言模型的二元分类，LLMs基于外部语料库和其世界知识做出决策，给出事实验证的判断理由。此方法专为半结构化网络文章而设计，在其中将主标题指定为尾实体并明确纳入上下文，潜在头实体根据生物医学词表进行匹配。此外，将冗长内容分割为文本块，嵌入并使用额外的嵌入模型进行检索。",
