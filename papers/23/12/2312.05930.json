In this study, we present a pioneering effort in constructing a comprehensive nailfold capillary dataset-321 images, 219 videos from 68 subjects, with clinic reports and expert annotations-that serves as a crucial resource for training deep-learning models. Leveraging this dataset, we finetuned three deep learning models with expert annotations as supervised labels and integrated them into a novel end-to-end nailfold capillary analysis pipeline. This pipeline excels in automatically detecting and measuring a wide range of size factors, morphological features, and dynamic aspects of nailfold capillaries. We compared our outcomes with clinical reports. Experiment results showed that our automated pipeline achieves an average of sub-pixel level precision in measurements and 89.9",
