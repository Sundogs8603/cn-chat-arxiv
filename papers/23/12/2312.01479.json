    "abstract": "We introduce OpenVoice, a versatile voice cloning approach that requires only a short audio clip from the reference speaker to replicate their voice and generate speech in multiple languages. OpenVoice represents a significant advancement in addressing the following open challenges in the field: 1) Flexible Voice Style Control. OpenVoice enables granular control over voice styles, including emotion, accent, rhythm, pauses, and intonation, in addition to replicating the tone color of the reference speaker. The voice styles are not directly copied from and constrained by the style of the reference speaker. Previous approaches lacked the ability to flexibly manipulate voice styles after cloning. 2) Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Voice Cloning. OpenVoice achieves zero-shot cross-lingual voice cloning for languages not included in the massive-speaker training set. Unlike previous approaches, which typically require extensive massive-speaker multi-lingual (MSML) dataset for all languages, OpenVoice",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了OpenVoice，一种多功能语音克隆方法，只需一小段参考讲话者的音频片段即可复制他们的声音并生成多种语言的语音。OpenVoice在以下领域中解决了一些开放性挑战：1）灵活的语音风格控制。OpenVoice可以精确控制语音风格，包括情感、口音、节奏、停顿和语调，同时复制参考讲话者的音色。之前的方法无法在克隆后灵活操控语音风格。2）零样本跨语言语音克隆。OpenVoice可以在未包含在大规模训练集中的语言上实现零样本的跨语言语音克隆。与之前的方法不同，之前的方法通常需要包含所有语言的大规模多讲话者多语言(MSML)数据集。",
