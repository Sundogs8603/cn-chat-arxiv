This study aims to explore how universities and educators respond and adapt to the development of GenAI in their academic contexts by analyzing academic policies and guidelines established by top-ranked US universities regarding the use of ChatGPT in higher education. The data sources include academic policies, statements, guidelines as well as relevant resources provided by the top 100 universities in the US. Results show that the majority of these universities adopt an open but cautious approach towards the integration of GenAI. Primary concerns lie in ethical usage, accuracy, and data privacy.
