    "translated_abstract": "针对联邦学习中数据分布、计算和通信资源之间显着异质性的实际情况，在传统客户选择算法中常常存在偏差，涉及对客户的均匀随机采样。这已被证明在实际设置下快速收敛是次优的，特别是对于由于与参数服务器（PS）通信机会有限所导致的时限约束应用，客户选择策略对于在固定通信循环预算内完成模型训练至关重要。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了一种有偏差的客户选择策略，称为GreedyFed，它在每个通信循环中识别并贪婪地选择最具贡献的客户。该方法基于一个快速逼近算法来计算参数服务器上的Shapley Value，使得在具有许多客户的实际应用中可以进行可行的计算。通过与多个实际数据集上的各种客户选择策略进行比较，GreedyFed可以更好地达到模型训练的效果。",
