    "translated_abstract": "粒子加速器复杂且由成千上万个组件组成，许多设备运行在其峰值功率下。因此，粒子加速器可能因为多种原因出现故障并中止运行。这些故障会影响计划运行时粒子加速器的可用性，降低效率和整体科学产出。为了避免这些故障，我们应用异常检测技术来预测任何不寻常的行为，并采取预防性措施来提高粒子加速器的总体可用性。基于半监督机器学习（ML）的异常检测方法，如自编码器和变分自编码器，通常用于这些任务。然而，监督式ML技术，如Siamese神经网络（SNN）模型，可以通过利用标签信息优于无监督或半监督方法进行异常检测。其中一个特定的挑战是异常检测过程中的标记数据的不足。",
