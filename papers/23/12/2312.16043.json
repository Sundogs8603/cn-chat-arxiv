    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的多项式参数化sigmoid函数，称为SIGTRON，它是一种扩展的非对称sigmoid函数和感知机的结合，以及它的伴随凸模型SIGTRON-不平衡分类(SIC)模型，该模型使用了虚拟SIGTRON产生的凸损失函数。与传统的$\\pi$-加权成本敏感学习模型相比，SIC模型在损失函数上没有外部的$\\pi$-权重，而是在虚拟的SIGTRON产生的损失函数中有内部参数。因此，当给定的训练数据集接近良好平衡的条件时，我们展示了所提出的SIC模型对数据集的变化更加适应，比如训练集和测试集之间比例不平衡的不一致性。这种适应是通过创建一个倾斜的超平面方程来实现的。另外，我们提出了一个基于拟牛顿优化(L-BFGS)框架的虚拟凸损失，通过开发一个基于区间的二分线性搜索算法来实现。",
