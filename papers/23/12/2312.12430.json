    "abstract": "arXiv:2312.12430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: In recent RAG approaches, rerankers play a pivotal role in refining retrieval accuracy with the ability of revealing logical relations for each pair of query and text. However, existing rerankers are required to repeatedly encode the query and a large number of long retrieved text. This results in high computational costs and limits the number of retrieved text, hindering accuracy. As a remedy of the problem, we introduce the Efficient Title Reranker via Broadcasting Query Encoder, a novel technique for title reranking that achieves a 20x-40x speedup over the vanilla passage reranker. Furthermore, we introduce Sigmoid Trick, a novel loss function customized for title reranking. Combining both techniques, we empirically validated their effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art results on all four datasets we experimented with from the KILT knowledge benchmark.",

    "translated_abstract": "在最近的RAG方法中，重新排序器在提升检索准确性方面发挥着关键作用，能够揭示每对查询和文本之间的逻辑关系。然而，现有的重新排序器需要反复对查询和大量长文本进行编码。这导致了较高的计算成本，并限制了检索文本的数量，从而影响了准确性。作为问题的解决方案，我们引入了通过广播查询编码器实现的高效标题重新排序器，这是一种用于标题重新排序的新技术，可以使速度提高20倍至40倍，超过基准通道重新排序器。此外，我们还引入了Sigmoid Trick，一种为标题重新排序定制的新损失函数。将这两种技术结合起来，我们在从KILT知识基准测试中实验的四个数据集上都经验验证了它们的有效性，实现了最先进的结果。",
