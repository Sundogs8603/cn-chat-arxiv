Their superior language understanding and reasoning capabilities allow users to automate complex and repetitive tasks.

To address these issues, this paper introduces MobileGPT, an innovative LLM-based mobile task automator equipped with a human-like app memory. MobileGPT emulates the cognitive process of humans interacting with a mobile app -- explore, select, derive, and recall. This approach allows for a more precise and efficient learning of a task's procedure by breaking it down into smaller, modular sub-tasks that can be re-used, re-arranged, and adapted for various objectives.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现为移动任务自动化领域带来了新的机遇。它们优越的语言理解和推理能力使用户能够自动执行复杂和重复的任务。然而，由于LLMs固有的不可靠性和高运行成本，它们的实际适用性相当有限。为解决这些问题，本文引入了MobileGPT，这是一种创新的基于LLM的移动任务自动化工具，配备了类人应用记忆。MobileGPT模拟了人类与移动应用交互的认知过程--探索、选择、推导和回忆。这种方法通过将任务程序分解为更小、模块化的子任务，允许更精确、高效地学习任务流程，从而实现子任务的重复使用、重新排列和适应各种目标。我们使用在线LLM服务（GPT-3.5和GPT-4）实现了MobileGPT，并在一组数据上评估了其性能。",
