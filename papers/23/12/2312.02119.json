    "abstract": "arXiv:2312.02119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) display versatile functionality, they continue to generate harmful, biased, and toxic content, as demonstrated by the prevalence of human-designed jailbreaks. In this work, we present Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP), an automated method for generating jailbreaks that only requires black-box access to the target LLM. TAP utilizes an LLM to iteratively refine candidate (attack) prompts using tree-of-thought reasoning until one of the generated prompts jailbreaks the target. Crucially, before sending prompts to the target, TAP assesses them and prunes the ones unlikely to result in jailbreaks. Using tree-of-thought reasoning allows TAP to navigate a large search space of prompts and pruning reduces the total number of queries sent to the target. In empirical evaluations, we observe that TAP generates prompts that jailbreak state-of-the-art LLMs (including GPT4 and GPT4-Turbo) for more than 80%",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)展示了多功能性，但仍在生成有害、带偏见和有毒内容，这一点由人为设计的越狱行为的普遍存在得以证明。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP)的自动化方法，用于生成越狱，仅需要对目标LLM进行黑盒访问。TAP利用LLM来通过思维树推理迭代地优化候选（攻击）提示，直到生成的提示之一越狱目标。关键在于，在将提示发送给目标之前，TAP对其进行评估并移除可能不会导致越狱的提示。使用思维树推理使TAP能够在大量提示的搜索空间中导航，而修剪则减少了发送给目标的总查询数量。在实证评估中，我们观察到TAP生成的提示越狱了超过80%的最先进LLMs（包括GPT4和GPT4-Turbo）。",
