    "translated_abstract": "2011年10月，丹麦引入了世界上第一个也是迄今为止唯一一个针对饱和脂肪的税收。然而，这项税收在2013年1月被废止。利用来自未课税的北德消费者的外生变动，我们采用差异研究法估计了税收实施和废除对税收目标的八个产品类别的消费和支出行为的因果效应。我们的发现揭示了这些产品的税收影响的显著异质性。在课税期间，特别是在低收入家庭中，培根、肝肠、莎莉米和奶酪的消费明显下降。相比之下，随着价格上涨，黄油、奶油、人造黄油和酸奶的支出增加。有趣的是，我们没有观察到高收入和低收入家庭在支出增加方面的差异，这表明低收入家庭受到了税收的不成比例影响。在税收废除之后，创新的研究方法表明对这些税收目标的消费和支出行为没有产生持续的影响。",
