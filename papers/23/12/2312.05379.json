We propose a simulated learning process, structured within a curriculum learning framework and augmented with noisy labels, to mirror the intricacies of self-play learning scenarios. This approach thoroughly analyses how neural networks (NNs) adapt and evolve from elementary to increasingly complex game positions. Our empirical research indicates that even minimal label noise can significantly impede NNs' ability to discern effective strategies, a difficulty that intensifies with the growing complexity of the game positions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advanced methodologies in RL training, specifically tailored to counter the obstacles imposed by noisy evaluations.

    "translated_abstract": "本论文深入研究了在策略游戏中应用强化学习（RL），特别是在围棋和国际象棋等特定局面以及更广泛的不偏博弈中存在的奇偶性挑战。我们提出了一个模拟学习过程，结构化在课程学习框架内，并通过噪声标签进行增强，以模拟自我对弈学习场景的复杂性。这种方法彻底分析了神经网络（NNs）如何从基本的到越来越复杂的游戏局面中适应和演变。我们的实证研究表明，即使存在最小的标签噪声，也会对NNs辨别有效策略的能力造成明显的阻碍，这一困难随着游戏局面复杂度的增加而加剧。这些发现强调了在RL训练中迫切需要先进的方法，专门应对由噪声评估所带来的障碍。研发这样的方法对于提高NN的专业水平至关重要。",
