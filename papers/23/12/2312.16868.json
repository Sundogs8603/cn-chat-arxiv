    "translated_abstract": "带有级联架构的推荐系统在在线推荐平台中发挥着越来越重要的作用，在处理负面反馈的方法上是一个关键问题。例如，在短视频平台上，用户往往会快速地滑动删除他们不喜欢的视频，推荐系统需要接收这些明确的负面反馈并进行调整以避免这些推荐。考虑到记忆中的近期效应，我们提出了一种基于艾宾浩斯遗忘曲线的遗忘模型，用于处理负面反馈。另外，我们引入了一个Pareto优化求解器，以在近期性和模型性能之间取得更好的平衡。总结来说，我们提出了基于Pareto的带有遗忘曲线的多目标推荐系统（PMORS），可以应用于任何多目标推荐，并在面对明确的负面反馈时表现出足够的优势。我们对PMORS进行了评估，并取得了有利的结果。",
