    "translated_abstract": "逆问题旨在从观测中确定参数，这是工程和科学中的一个关键任务。最近，生成模型，特别是扩散模型，因其能够产生逼真的解决方案和良好的数学特性而在这一领域中越来越受欢迎。尽管取得了成功，但扩散模型的一个重要缺点是对方差调度的选择敏感，该调度控制着扩散过程的动态。为特定应用程序微调这个调度是至关重要的，但时间成本高昂，并且不能保证最优结果。我们提出了一种新颖的方法，将学习调度作为训练过程的一部分。我们的方法支持对数据的概率条件，提供高质量的解决方案，并且具有灵活性，能够在最小的开销下适应不同的应用。这种方法在两个不相关的逆问题中进行了测试：超分辨率显微镜和定量相位成像，结果表明比较或更好。",
