    "translated_abstract": "随着数据集规模的增大，准确标注这些数据集变得越来越不切实际，因为在时间和经济上都变得更加昂贵。因此，众包已被广泛采用以减轻收集标签的成本，但这也不可避免地引入了标签噪声，最终降低了模型的性能。为了从众包标注中学习，对每个标注者的专业知识进行建模是一种常见但具有挑战性的范式，因为通过众包收集的标注通常是高度稀疏的。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了耦合混淆校正（CCC），其中同时训练两个模型来校正彼此学习的混淆矩阵。通过双层优化，一个模型学习的混淆矩阵可以通过另一个模型的精炼数据进行校正。此外，我们对“标注者组”进行聚类，这些组共享相似的专业知识，从而提高他们的混淆矩阵。",
