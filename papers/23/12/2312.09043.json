    "translated_abstract": "情绪语料库通常是基于关键词/标签搜索或通过询问研究参与者生成文本实例来采样的。无论哪种情况，这些语料库都不是代表领域整体的均匀样本。我们假设这种数据获取方式导致了这些语料库中过度呈现的主题之间不切实际的相关性，从而损害了模型的泛化能力。这种主题偏差可能会导致错误的预测，例如对于实例\"I organized the service for my aunt's funeral.\"，尽管与悲伤情绪标记的实例中的葬礼事件过度呈现，但更适合的情绪是自豪。在本文中，我们从数据和建模角度研究了这种主题偏差。我们首先通过主题建模自动标记了一组情绪语料库，并展示了情绪实际上与特定主题相关。此外，我们发现情绪分类器受到这些主题的干扰。最后，我们展示了已建立的去偏差方法可以减轻主题偏差的影响。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the issue of topic bias in emotion classification, finding that there is correlation between topics and emotions in emotion corpora, and that emotion classifiers are easily confounded by these topics. Finally, the researchers demonstrate a debiasing method to mitigate the impact of topic bias."
