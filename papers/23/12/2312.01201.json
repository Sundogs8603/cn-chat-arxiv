    "translated_abstract": "数据隐私保护正在引起研究人员的越来越多的关注。扩散模型（DMs），尤其是具有严格的差分隐私，有可能生成既具有高隐私性又具有良好视觉质量的图像。然而，挑战在于确保在私有化特定数据属性时的强大保护，当前模型在这些方面经常存在不足。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了PAC隐私保护扩散模型，这是一种利用扩散原理并确保“可能大致正确（PAC）”隐私性的模型。我们通过将私有分类器指导集成到Langevin采样过程中来增强隐私保护。此外，认识到在衡量模型隐私性方面存在差距，我们开发了一种新的度量标准来衡量隐私水平。我们的模型通过这个新度量标准评估，并通过高斯矩阵计算支持PAC界限，表现出更优异的隐私性能。",
