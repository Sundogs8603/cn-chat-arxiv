    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型是一种新型的生成模型，最近成功应用于语音增强。先前的研究已经证明了其在不匹配条件下与最先进的判别模型相比具有更高的性能。然而，这些研究只使用了一个数据库进行训练，另一个数据库进行测试，这使得结果高度依赖于特定的数据库。此外，图像生成领域的最新进展在语音增强方面仍未得到充分探索。这些进展包括扩散模型的几个设计方面，如噪声调度或反向采样器。在这项工作中，我们通过使用多个语音、噪声和双耳室内脉冲响应（BRIR）数据库来模拟不匹配的声学条件，系统评估了基于扩散模型的语音增强模型的泛化性能。我们还尝试了一种在语音增强中尚未应用的噪声调度和采样器方法。",
