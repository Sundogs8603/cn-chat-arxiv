    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on the prediction phase of a random forest and study the problem of representing a bag of decision trees using a smaller bag of decision trees, where we only consider binary decision problems on the binary domain and simple decision trees in which an internal node is limited to querying the Boolean value of a single variable. As a main result, we show that the majority function of $n$ variables can be represented by a bag of $T$ ($< n$) decision trees each with polynomial size if $n-T$ is a constant, where $n$ and $T$ must be odd (in order to avoid the tie break). We also show that a bag of $n$ decision trees can be represented by a bag of $T$ decision trees each with polynomial size if $n-T$ is a constant and a small classification error is allowed. A related result on the $k$-out-of-$n$ functions is presented too.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文致力于随机森林的预测阶段，并研究了使用较小的决策树集合代表一个决策树集合的问题，其中仅考虑二进制决策问题和简单决策树，内部节点只查询单个变量的布尔值。作为主要结果，我们证明了如果n-T是常数，则可以通过一个包含T（<n）个决策树的集合（每个决策树大小为多项式）来表示n个变量的多数函数，其中n和T必须是奇数（以避免决胜局）。我们还表明，如果n-T是常数并且允许小的分类错误，则可以用一个包含T个决策树的集合（每个决策树大小为多项式）来表示一个包含n个决策树的集合。还介绍了k-选-n函数的相关结果。",
