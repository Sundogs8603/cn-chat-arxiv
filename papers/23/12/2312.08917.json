    "translated_abstract": "在工业制造中，基于人工智能的缺陷检测至关重要。然而，许多方法针对特定的流水线，在面对各种产品组合和不断变化的流程时往往面临特征冲突问题。为解决这个问题，我们提出了增量统一框架（IUF），可以在不断整合新物体时减少特征冲突问题，这在面临物体增量学习场景中具有优势。我们使用最先进的transformer引入了对象感知自注意力（OASA）来划分明确的语义边界。集成了语义压缩损失（SCL）来优化非主要语义空间，增强了网络对新物体的适应性。此外，在权重更新时，我们优先保留已建立物体的特征。通过在图像和像素级缺陷检测方面展示出卓越性能，我们的方法实现了最先进的性能，对于动态和可扩展的工业检测至关重要。",
