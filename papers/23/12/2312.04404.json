    "translated_abstract": "自动决策系统越来越多地用于在人们的生活中做出重要决策。由于操纵数据的敏感性以及由此产生的决策，需要解决一些伦理关切以便适当地使用这些技术，特别是公平性和隐私性。与之前关注单一敏感属性的集中式差分隐私（DP）或局部差分隐私（LDP）的工作不同，本文研究了多个敏感属性（即多维数据）存在时 LDP 对公平性的影响。对合成和基准数据集进行了详细的实证分析，揭示了非常相关的观察结果。特别是，（1）多维 LDP 是减少差距的有效方法，（2）在低隐私保证下，LDP 的多维方法（独立 vs. 组合）很重要，（3）结果 Y 分布对哪个群体有重要影响。",
