    "translated_abstract": "Segment Anything Model（SAM）在通用对象分割方面显示出潜力，并为各种应用提供了可能性。现有方法已将SAM应用于手术器械分割（SIS），通过使用手术数据调整基于SAM的框架。然而，它们在两个关键方面存在不足：（1）使用器械掩模直接调整模型将每个器械视为单个实体，忽略了其复杂结构和细粒度细节；（2）基于器械类别的提示不够灵活和信息丰富，无法描述器械结构。为解决这些问题，在本文中，我们研究了可提示的SIS，并提出了手术器械部分-SAM（SP-SAM），一种新颖的SAM高效调整方法，明确将器械结构知识与SAM的通用知识整合在一起，由器械部分组成的专家知识指导。具体来说，我们通过提出",
