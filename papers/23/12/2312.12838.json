    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）由于其保护隐私的特性，已经成为分散式医学数据训练分割模型的一种有前景的范式。然而，现有研究忽视了在真实医学数据集中常见的注释噪声，这限制了FL的性能。在本文中，我们首次确定并解决了这个问题。对于问题的形式化，我们提出了一个轮廓演化来对每个客户端内像素之间的非独立同分布（Non-IID）噪声进行建模，然后扩展到多源数据的情况，形成一个异构噪声模型（即交叉区别标注噪声）。为了从具有这两个层次的非I-ID噪声的注释中实现健壮的学习，我们强调了模型聚合中数据质量的重要性，允许高质量的客户端对FL产生更大的影响。为了实现这一点，我们提出了具有注释质量感知聚合的联邦学习方法，称为FedA3I。",
