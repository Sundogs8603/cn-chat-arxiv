Existing commercial interfaces for synthesizers typically require musicians to interact with complex low-level parameters or to manage large libraries of premade sounds. To address these challenges, we implement SynthScribe -- a fullstack system that uses multimodal deep learning to let users express their intentions at a much higher level. We implement features which address a number of difficulties, namely 1) searching through existing sounds, 2) creating completely new sounds, 3) making meaningful modifications to a given sound. This is achieved with three main features: a multimodal search engine for a large library of synthesizer sounds; a user centered genetic algorithm by which completely new sounds can be created and selected given the users preferences; a sound editing support feature which highlights and gives examples for key ",

    "translated_abstract": "合成器是能够让音乐家创作出动态和原创声音的强大工具。现有的用于合成器的商用界面通常要求音乐家与复杂的低级参数进行交互，或者管理大量预制声音库。为了解决这些挑战，我们实现了SynthScribe——一个利用多模态深度学习的全栈系统，让用户可以以更高级别表达他们的意图。我们实现了几个功能，以解决一些困难，即1）搜索现有声音，2）创建全新声音，3）对给定声音进行有意义的修改。这通过三个主要功能实现：一个用于大型合成器声音库的多模态搜索引擎；一个以用户为中心的遗传算法，可以根据用户的偏好创建和选择全新声音；一个声音编辑支持功能，突出显示并提供关键示例",
