    "translated_abstract": "在气候科学和气象学领域，高分辨率的局部降水（雨雪）预测受到基于模拟方法的计算成本限制。统计降尺度，或者称为超分辨率，是一种常见的解决方法，其中低分辨率预测通过统计方法得到改进。与传统计算机视觉任务不同，天气和气候应用需要捕捉给定低分辨率模式的高分辨率的准确条件分布，以确保可靠的集合平均和极端事件（如暴雨）的无偏估计。本研究将最新的视频扩散模型扩展到降水超分辨率，使用确定性降尺度器，然后是暂时条件的扩散模型来捕捉噪声特征和高频率模式。我们在FV3GFS输出上测试了我们的方法，这是一个已建立的大规模全球大气模型，并将其与其他方法进行了比较。",
