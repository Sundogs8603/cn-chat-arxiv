    "translated_abstract": "随机微分方程广泛用于建模真实世界的随机现象。现有的工作主要集中在时间序列由单个随机微分方程建模的情况，这对于具有分布偏移的时间序列建模可能是局限的。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种将时间序列建模为神经随机微分方程的变点检测算法。给定一个时间序列数据集，所提出的方法联合学习未知的变点和与每个变点对应的不同神经随机微分方程模型的参数。具体而言，神经随机微分方程在生成对抗网络（GAN）的框架下进行学习，并且变点是根据GAN判别器的输出在前向传递中被检测到。在所提出的算法的每一步中，变点和SDE模型参数以交替的方式进行更新。通过对合成和真实数据集的数值结果进行验证，以验证我们的算法与传统方法的性能比较。",
