    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）展示了显著的能力，但面临幻觉、过时知识和非透明、不可追溯的推理过程等挑战。检索增强生成（RAG）已经成为一种有前途的解决方案，通过整合来自外部数据库的知识，增强模型的准确性和可信度，特别适用于知识密集型任务，并允许持续更新知识和整合领域特定信息。RAG将LLMs自身的知识与庞大、动态的外部数据库相结合，实现协同效应。本综述论文详细考察了RAG范式的发展，包括Naive RAG、Advanced RAG和Modular RAG。它详细审视了RAG框架的三个基本要素，包括检索、生成和增强技术。本文强调了嵌入在RAG框架中的最新技术。",
