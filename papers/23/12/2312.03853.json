    "translated_abstract": "仅仅一年前，我们目睹了大型语言模型（LLMs）的使用增加，尤其是在结合像聊天机器人助手之类的应用时。为了防止这些助手产生不当回应，我们实施了安全机制和专门的训练程序。在这项工作中，我们通过让ChatGPT和Bard（以及在某种程度上是Bing chat）冒充复杂人物角色，绕过了这些措施，这些角色与它们本应成为的真实助手的特征相反。我们首先创造出这些人物角色的复杂传记，然后在同一聊天机器人中使用它们进行新的对话。我们的对话采用角色扮演风格，以获得助手不被允许提供的回应。通过使用人物角色，我们展示了被禁止的回应实际上被提供了，从而有可能获取未经授权、非法或有害的信息。这项工作表明，通过使用对抗性pe",
