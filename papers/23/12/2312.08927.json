    "abstract": "Hawkes Process has been used to model Limit Order Book (LOB) dynamics in several ways in the literature however the focus has been limited to capturing the inter-event times while the order size is usually assumed to be constant. We propose a novel methodology of using Compound Hawkes Process for the LOB where each event has an order size sampled from a calibrated distribution. The process is formulated in a novel way such that the spread of the process always remains positive. Further, we condition the model parameters on time of day to support empirical observations. We make use of an enhanced non-parametric method to calibrate the Hawkes kernels and allow for inhibitory cross-excitation kernels. We showcase the results and quality of fits for an equity stock's LOB in the NASDAQ exchange.",

    "translated_abstract": "霍克斯进程已在文献中多种方式被用于模拟限价单簿动态，但往往仅关注事件间隔，而订单尺寸通常被假设为常数。我们提出了一种新颖的方法，使用复合霍克斯进程来模拟限价单簿，其中每个事件的订单尺寸来自校准分布。该方法以一种新颖的方式构建，使进程的价差始终保持正值。此外，我们根据时间条件模型参数以支持经验观察。我们使用改进的非参数方法来校准霍克斯核函数，并允许抑制性交叉激发核函数。我们展示了在纳斯达克交易所中一只股票的限价单簿上的结果和适度程度。",
