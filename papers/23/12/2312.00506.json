    "abstract": "Creativity is core to being human. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) -- including ever more powerful large language models (LLMs) -- holds promise for humans to be more creative by offering new ideas, or less creative by anchoring on GenAI ideas. We study the causal impact of GenAI ideas on the production of a short story in an online experimental study where some writers could obtain story ideas from a GenAI platform. We find that access to GenAI ideas causes stories to be evaluated as more creative, better written, and more enjoyable, especially among less creative writers. However, GenAI-enabled stories are more similar to each other than stories by humans alone. These results point to an increase in individual creativity at the risk of losing collective novelty. This dynamic resembles a social dilemma: with GenAI, individual writers are better off, but collectively a narrower scope of novel content may be produced.

    "translated_abstract": "创造力是人类的核心。生成人工智能（GenAI），包括越来越强大的大型语言模型（LLM），通过提供新的想法使人类更具创造力，或通过锚定于GenAI的想法而变得不那么创造性。本研究通过在线实验研究探究了GenAI想法对一篇短篇小说创作的因果影响，其中一些作者可以从GenAI平台获取故事创意。我们发现，获取GenAI想法导致故事被评为更有创造力、写得更好和更令人愉悦，特别是在创造力较低的作者中。然而，GenAI启用的故事之间更相似，而不是仅由人类创作的故事。这些结果表明，个体创造力增加的同时，集体新颖性可能会减少。这种动态类似于社会困境：通过GenAI，个别作家能受益，但可能会产生更窄范围的新内容。我们的结果对研究人员、决策者有重要影响。",
