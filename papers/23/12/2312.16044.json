    "translated_abstract": "交通信号控制（TSC）是城市交通管理的关键组成部分，旨在优化道路网络效率和减少拥堵。传统的TSC方法主要基于交通工程和强化学习（RL），往往在各种交通场景中存在泛化性不足和缺乏解释性等限制。本文提出了LLMLight，这是一个采用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为TSC决策代理的新框架。具体而言，该框架通过向LLM提供详细的实时交通状况说明作为指导，借助LLM的先进泛化能力，LLMLight实现了类似人类直觉的推理和决策过程，从而实现有效的交通控制。此外，我们构建了LightGPT，这是一个专为TSC任务量身定制的骨干LLM。通过学习细微的交通模式和控制策略，LightGPT在经济成本方面提升了LLMLight框架的效果。进行了大量的实验验证了LLMLight的有效性和性能优势。",
