    "translated_abstract": "人类识别复杂视觉模式的能力是通过顺次区域在腹侧视觉皮层中执行的变换所形成的。最近的端到端训练的深度神经网络逼近了人类的能力，并且提供了迄今为止对层次结构的后期神经反应的最佳描述。然而，与传统的手工设计模型相比，或者与优化编码效率或预测的模型相比，这些网络对前期阶段提供了较差的描述。此外，用于端到端学习的梯度反向传播通常被认为在生物上是不切实际的。在这里，我们通过开发一种自下而上的自监督训练方法，独立地作用于连续层，从而克服了这两个限制。具体地，我们最大化了对局部变形自然图像补丁对之间的特征相似性，并在采样自其他位置的补丁时使特征去相关。",
