    "translated_abstract": "建立一个可以与世界互动的通用代理是人工智能系统的引人注目目标，因此激发了关于体验导航的研究，其中代理需要根据指示进行导航或回答查询。尽管取得了主要进展，先前的工作主要集中在特定任务的代理上，缺乏对未见场景的泛化能力。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）在各个领域展现出卓越的能力，并为体验导航提供了机会。基于此，我们提出了首个面向体验导航的通用模型NaviLLM。它通过引入基于模式的指导来将LLMs调整到体验导航中。基于模式的指导灵活地将各种任务转化为生成问题，从而统一了各种任务。这种方法使我们能够将来自各个数据集的多样化数据源集成到训练中，为NaviLLM配备了广泛的能力。",
