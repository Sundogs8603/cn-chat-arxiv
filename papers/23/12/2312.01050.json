Automatic stress detection in text can proactively help manage stress and protect mental well-being. In today's digital era, social media platforms reflect the psychological well-being and stress levels within various communities. This study focuses on detecting and analyzing stress-related posts in Reddit academic communities. Due to online education and remote work, these communities have become central for academic discussions and support. We classify text as stressed or not using natural language processing and machine learning classifiers, with Dreaddit as our training dataset, which contains labeled data from Reddit. Next, we collect and analyze posts from various academic subreddits. We identified that the most effective individual feature for stress detection is the Bag of Words, paired with the Logistic ",

    "translated_abstract": "目前，监测压力水平并及早识别心理疾病的重要性不言而喻。文本中的自动压力检测能够积极帮助管理压力，保护心理健康。在当今数字时代，社交媒体平台反映了不同社区内的心理健康和压力水平。该研究侧重于检测和分析Reddit学术社区中与压力有关的帖子。由于在线教育和远程工作，这些社区已经成为学术讨论和支持的中心。我们使用自然语言处理和机器学习分类器将文本分类为有压力或无压力，其中我们的训练数据集是Dreaddit，其中包含来自Reddit的标记数据。接下来，我们收集并分析来自各种学术子社区的帖子。我们发现对于压力检测最有效的个别特征是词袋（Bag of Words），配合逻辑回归。",
