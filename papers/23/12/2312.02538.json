    "translated_abstract": "稠密检索方法主要关注非结构化文本，对于具有不同方面的结构化数据(例如，具有类别和品牌等方面的产品)的关注较少。最近的研究提出了两种方法来将方面信息合并到项目表示中，以通过预测与项目方面相关联的值实现有效检索。尽管这些方法非常有效，但它们将值视为孤立的类别(例如，“智能家居”、“家居、花园和工具”和“美容和健康”)，忽略了它们之间的细粒度语义关系。此外，它们要么强迫将方面的学习集中到CLS令牌中，这可能会混淆其作为表达整个内容语义的指定用途，要么仅通过值预测目标学习额外的方面嵌入，这在没有为项目方面注释的值时可能不足够。鉴于这些限制，我们提出了一种多颗粒度感知的多方面学习模型（MUlti-granulaRity-aware Aspect Learning model）",
    "tldr": "这项研究提出了一种多颗粒度感知的多方面学习模型，用于解决结构化数据的稠密检索问题。与现有方法不同的是，该模型不仅考虑了项目方面值之间的细粒度语义关系，还避免了将方面学习集中到CLS令牌或仅通过值预测目标学习方面嵌入的问题。",
    "en_tdlr": "This research proposes a multi-granularity-aware aspect learning model for dense retrieval of structured data. Unlike existing methods, this model considers the fine-grained semantic relations among aspect values and avoids the issues of focusing aspect learning on the CLS token or learning aspect embeddings only through value prediction objectives."
