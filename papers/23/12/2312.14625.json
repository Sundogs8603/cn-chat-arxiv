Adversaries may exploit vulnerabilities in the data collection or processing of navigation services to inject false information, and to thus interfere with the drivers' route selection. Such attacks can significantly increase traffic congestions, resulting in substantial waste of time and resources, and may even disrupt essential services that rely on road networks. To assess the threat posed by such attacks, we introduce a computational framework to find worst-case data-injection attacks against transportation networks. First, we devise an adversarial model with a threat actor who can manipulate drivers by increasing the travel times that they perceive on certain roads.

    "translated_abstract": "驾驶员对导航应用程序的日益依赖使得交通网络更容易受到恶意行为者的数据篡改攻击的影响。对手可能利用导航服务的数据收集或处理方面的漏洞来注入虚假信息，从而干扰驾驶员的路径选择。这种攻击可能显著增加交通拥堵，导致时间和资源的大量浪费，甚至可能破坏依赖道路网络的基本服务。为了评估此类攻击带来的威胁，我们引入了一个计算框架来发现针对交通网络的最坏情况数据注入攻击。首先，我们设计了一个拥有威胁行为者的对抗模型，该行为者可以通过增加驾驶员在某些道路上感知的行驶时间来操纵他们。然后，我们采用分层多智能体强化学习来找到一种近似最佳的对抗策略。",
