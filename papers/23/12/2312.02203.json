    "translated_abstract": "从功能性磁共振成像（fMRI）信号中发现脑区之间可靠且具有信息量的关系对于表型预测至关重要。大多数现有方法无法准确地表征这些相互作用，因为它们只关注配对连接并忽视了脑区的高阶关系。我们提出这些高阶关系应该具有最大的信息量和最小的冗余（MIMR）。然而，由于指数级的搜索空间和可解性目标的缺乏，发现这种高阶关系是具有挑战性且未经探索的。针对这一间隙，我们提出了一种名为HYBRID的新方法，旨在从fMRI数据中提取MIMR高阶关系。HYBRID利用CONSTRUCTOR来识别超边结构，并利用WEIGHTER来计算每个超边的权重，从而避免在指数空间中进行搜索。HYBRID取得了...",
