    "translated_abstract": "随着智能移动设备在无线设备间(D2D)网络中的普及，分散式联邦学习(DFL)备受关注。与集中式联邦学习(CFL)相比，DFL减轻了由于通信瓶颈导致中央服务器故障的风险。然而，DFL面临一些挑战，如不同环境中数据分布的严重异构性，以及D2D网络中采用用户数据报协议(UDP)导致的传输中断和数据包错误。这些挑战通常会降低训练DFL模型的收敛性。为了解决这些挑战，我们对DFL进行了深入的理论收敛性分析，并提出了一个收敛界。通过在这一收敛界中定义一个名为不可靠链接感知邻域差异的新领域数量，我们制定了一个可行的优化目标，并开发了一种新的拓扑学习方法。",
