    "translated_abstract": "表格结构识别是一个广泛讨论的任务，旨在将无结构的表格图像转换为结构化格式，如HTML序列，以便使用仅处理文本的模型（如ChatGPT）进一步处理这些表格。一种解决方案是使用检测模型检测表格组件（例如列和行），然后应用基于规则的后处理方法将检测结果转换为HTML序列。然而，现有的基于检测的模型在单元级别的表格结构识别度量（如TEDS）方面通常表现不如其他类型的解决方案，并且这些模型在TSR任务上性能不佳的潜在原因也没有得到很好的探索。因此，我们全面重新审视现有的基于检测的模型，并探索影响这些模型性能的潜在原因，包括问题定义不当、检测和TSR度量的不匹配问题、检测模型的特性以及局部特征的影响。",
