    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs），如GPT4和LLaMA，由于其强大的文本编码/解码能力和新发现的紧急能力（例如推理）在自然语言处理方面取得了显著的进展。虽然LLMs主要设计用于处理纯文本，但在许多现实场景中，文本数据与图形形式的丰富结构信息相关联（例如学术网络和电子商务网络），或者图形数据与丰富的文本信息配对（例如带有描述的分子）。此外，尽管LLMs已经展示了其基于纯文本的推理能力，但尚未探索此类能力是否可以推广到图形上（即基于图形的推理）。在本文中，我们对在图上的大型语言模型相关场景和技术进行了系统回顾。我们首先总结了采用LLMs在图形上的潜在场景，分为纯图形、文本属性图形和文本配对图形三个类别。",
