    "translated_abstract": "尽管现有的防御措施对抗基于查询的攻击前景广阔，但它们存在一个共同的局限性：它们在提高对抗攻击鲁棒性的同时，会显著降低对干净样本的准确性。本文展示了如何在测试阶段有效建立鲁棒性和准确性之间的 solid tradeoff，以缓解基于查询攻击。考虑到这些攻击必然探索低置信区域，我们的观点是，仅针对低置信度的输入激活专门的防御措施，如随机噪声防御和随机图像变换，就足以阻止它们。我们的方法与训练无关，有理论支持。通过在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上进行大量实验，我们验证了我们的方法的有效性。我们的结果表明，我们的提议确实可以通过提供更好的鲁棒性和准确性之间的权衡，增强这些防御措施。",
