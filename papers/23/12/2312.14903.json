    "translated_abstract": "在这项研究中，我们开发了一个用于模拟大规模Agent-based金融市场的计算框架。我们的平台支持交易多个同时商品，并利用分布式计算来扩展模拟代理的数量和复杂度。异质代理并行做出决策，并通过一个真实的连续双向拍卖交易引擎处理他们的订单。我们展示了一个基准模型的实现，并证明了它能捕捉到多个已知的实际金融市场统计特性（即样式化事实）。此外，我们证明了这些结果并没有将模型拟合到历史金融数据。因此，这个框架可以用于直接应用，如人类参与的机器学习，或者探索关于市场微观结构在形成实际市场统计规律方面的理论问题。据我们所知，这项研究是第一个实现多个资产和并行代理决策的。",
