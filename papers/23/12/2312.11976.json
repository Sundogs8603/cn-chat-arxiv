    "abstract": "Time-series anomaly detection deals with the problem of detecting anomalous timesteps by learning normality from the sequence of observations. However, the concept of normality evolves over time, leading to a \"new normal problem\", where the distribution of normality can be changed due to the distribution shifts between training and test data. This paper highlights the prevalence of the new normal problem in unsupervised time-series anomaly detection studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective test-time adaptation strategy based on trend estimation and a self-supervised approach to learning new normalities during inference. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the proposed strategy into the anomaly detector consistently improves the model's performance compared to the baselines, leading to robustness to the distribution shifts.",

    "translated_abstract": "时间序列异常检测处理通过从观察序列中学习正常性来检测异常时间步骤的问题。然而，正常性的概念随时间演变，导致出现了“新常态问题”，即由于训练和测试数据之间的分布变化，正常性的分布可能发生改变。本文重点研究了无监督时间序列异常检测研究中新常态问题的普遍存在。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种简单而有效的测试时适应策略，该策略基于趋势估计和自监督学习方法，在推断过程中学习新的正常性。对真实世界基准的广泛实验表明，将所提策略纳入异常检测器中，与基准相比，能够持续改善模型的性能，使其对分布变化具有鲁棒性。",
