Most formulations of temporal complex event are unstructured or without extensive temporal information, resulting in inferior representations and limited forecasting capabilities. To bridge these gaps, we innovatively introduce the formulation of Structured, Complex, and Time-complete temporal event (SCTc-TE). Following this comprehensive formulation, we develop a fully automated pipeline and construct a large-scale dataset named MidEast-TE from about 0.6 million news articles. This dataset focuses on the cooperation and conflict events among countries mainly in the MidEast region from 2015 to 2022.

    "translated_abstract": "时间复杂事件预测旨在根据历史上观察到的事件来预测未来事件。大多数时间复杂事件的形式化是非结构化的或缺乏广泛的时间信息，导致表征不足和预测能力有限。为了填补这些差距，我们创新地引入了结构化、复杂和时间完整的时间事件（SCTc-TE）的形式化。在这个全面的形式化之后，我们开发了一个完全自动化的流程，并从约60万篇新闻文章中构建了一个名为MidEast-TE的大规模数据集。该数据集侧重于2015年至2022年间主要涉及中东地区各国之间的合作和冲突事件。除了数据集构建之外，更重要的是，我们通过区分各种上下文信息（即，本地和全球上下文）来推进预测方法。因此，我们提出了一种新颖的",
