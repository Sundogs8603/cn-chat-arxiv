    "abstract": "Although deep learning are commonly employed for image recognition, usually huge amount of labeled training data is required, which may not always be readily available. This leads to a noticeable performance disparity when compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised face verification techniques. In this work, we propose a method to narrow this gap by leveraging an autoencoder to convert the face image vector into a novel representation. Notably, the autoencoder is trained to reconstruct neighboring face image vectors rather than the original input image vectors. These neighbor face image vectors are chosen through an unsupervised process based on the highest cosine scores with the training face image vectors. The proposed method achieves a relative improvement of 56\\% in terms of EER over the baseline system on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. This has successfully narrowed down the performance gap between cosine and PLDA scoring systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管深度学习在图像识别中被广泛应用，但通常需要大量标注的训练数据，往往难以获得。这导致了与最先进的无监督人脸验证技术相比存在明显的性能差距。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种方法通过利用自动编码器将人脸图像向量转换为新的表示来缩小这一差距。值得注意的是，自动编码器训练的是重构相邻的人脸图像向量而不是原始输入图像向量。这些邻居人脸图像向量是通过一个基于与训练人脸图像向量的最高余弦相似度的无监督过程选择的。该方法在Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)数据集上相对于基线系统在EER方面取得了56%的相对改进。这成功地缩小了余弦相似度和PLDA评分系统之间的性能差距。",
