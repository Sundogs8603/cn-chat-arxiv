    "abstract": "Popular guidance for denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) linearly combines distinct conditional models together to provide enhanced control over samples. However, this approach overlooks nonlinear effects that become significant when guidance scale is large. To address this issue, we propose characteristic guidance, a sampling method that provides first-principle non-linear correction for classifier-free guided DDPMs. Such correction forces the guided DDPMs to respect the Fokker-Planck equation of their underlying diffusion process, in a way that is training-free, derivative-free, and compatible with existing sampling methods. Experiments show that characteristic guidance enhances control and reduces color and exposure issues in image generation, proving effective in diverse applications ranging from latent space sampling to solving physics problems like magnet phase transitions.",

    "translated_abstract": "流行的导引去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)线性地将不同的条件模型组合在一起，以提供对样本的增强控制。然而，这种方法忽视了当导向尺度变大时产生的非线性效应。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了特征引导，一种采样方法，为无分类器导向的DDPM提供了一种基于原理的非线性校正。这种校正迫使导向的DDPM遵守其底层扩散过程的福克-普朗克方程，这种方法无需训练，无需导数，与现有的采样方法兼容。实验证明，特征引导增强了对图像生成中的控制能力，并减少了颜色和曝光问题，对从潜在空间采样到解决物理问题如磁相变的各种应用都有效。",
