    "translated_abstract": "最近，像ChatGPT或InstructGPT这样的大型语言模型（LLM）在人工智能领域产生了重大影响。许多研究尝试复现复杂的InstructGPT的训练流程，即基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）。然而，主流的分布式RLHF训练方法通常采用固定的模型部署策略，称为Flattening策略。该策略将RLHF中涉及的四个相互依赖的模型视为单个实体，将它们分配到所有设备上，并应用于单个模型设计的并行技术，而不考虑每个模型固有的不同工作负载。结果，该策略加剧了RLHF训练中的生成瓶颈，并降低了整体训练效率。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种自适应模型部署框架，提供了两种灵活的模型部署策略。交替策略有助于减少内存冗余和通信成本。",
