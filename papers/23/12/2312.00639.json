    "abstract": "Modeling large scenes from unconstrained images has proven to be a major challenge in computer vision. Existing methods tackling in-the-wild scene modeling operate in closed-world settings, where no conditioning on priors acquired from real-world images is present. We propose RefinedFields, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first method leveraging pre-trained models to improve in-the-wild scene modeling. We employ pre-trained networks to refine K-Planes representations via optimization guidance using an alternating training procedure. We carry out extensive experiments and verify the merit of our method on synthetic data and real tourism photo collections. RefinedFields enhances rendered scenes with richer details and outperforms previous work on the task of novel view synthesis in the wild.

    "translated_abstract": "从无约束的图像中建模大场景被证明是计算机视觉中的一个重大挑战。现有方法处理野外场景建模是在封闭的环境中，没有对从真实世界图像获得的先验条件进行约束。我们提出了RefinedFields，这是我们所知的第一种利用预训练模型来改善野外场景建模的方法。我们使用预训练网络通过优化指导使用交替训练过程来细化K-Planes表示。我们进行了大量实验证实我们方法在合成数据和真实旅游照片集上的优点。RefinedFields增强了渲染场景的细节，优于以往在野外进行新视角合成任务的工作。我们的项目页面可以在https://refinedfields.github.io找到。",
