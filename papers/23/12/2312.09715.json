Most existing CTR Prediction models utilize explicit feature interactions to overcome the performance bottleneck of implicit feature interactions. Hence, deep CTR models based on parallel structures (e.g., DCN, FinalMLP, xDeepFM) have been proposed to obtain joint information from different semantic spaces. However, these parallel subcomponents lack effective supervisory signals, making it challenging to efficiently capture valuable multi-views feature interaction information in different semantic spaces.
