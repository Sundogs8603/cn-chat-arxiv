    "translated_abstract": "偏好学习是将语言模型与人类价值观对齐的关键技术。从人类反馈强化学习（RLHF）是一种基于模型的算法，用于优化偏好学习，首先拟合偏好分数的奖励模型，然后使用基于策略梯度算法进行优化，以最大化奖励。RLHF的处理过程复杂、耗时且不稳定。直接偏好优化（DPO）算法使用离策略算法直接优化生成策略，消除了对奖励模型的需求，具有高效和稳定的数据利用率。DPO使用布拉德利-特里模型和对数损失，导致在偏好接近确定性时忽略了KL正则化项而过度拟合偏好数据。IPO使用一种基于根查找的成对均方误差损失来解决忽略KL正则化问题，并学习到最优策略。但是IPO的成对损失仍然无法使KL正则化生效。本文设计了一种新的算法，使用重要性抽样技术来解决偏好学习中的优化问题。",
