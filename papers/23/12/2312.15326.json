We characterize the existence of an allocation in which every agent receives a contiguous piece worth strictly more than their proportional share, also known as a *strongly-proportional allocation*. The characterization is supplemented with an algorithm that determines the existence of a connected strongly-proportional allocation using at most $n \\cdot 2^{n-1}$ queries. We provide a simpler characterization for agents with strictly positive valuations, and show that the number of queries required to determine the existence of a connected strongly-proportional allocation is in $\\Theta(n^2)$. Our proofs are constructive and yield a connected strongly-proportional allocation, when it exists, using a similar number of queries.",
