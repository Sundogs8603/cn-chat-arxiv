    "translated_abstract": "对于黑素瘤的及时治疗至关重要。为了帮助医生快速准确地识别病变区域，我们提出了一种新的皮肤病变分割技术，名为SLP-Net，这是一种基于脉冲神经P(SNP)系统机制的超轻量级分割网络。大多数现有的卷积神经网络在高分割准确度的同时忽视了高硬件成本。相反，SLP-Net具有非常少的参数和高计算速度。我们设计了一个轻量级的多尺度特征提取器，没有常见的编码器-解码器结构。我们设计了一个特征适应模块来替代解码器，并实现多尺度信息解码。在ISIC2018挑战赛上的实验证明，所提出的模型在Acc和DSC上具有最高的性能，而在PH2数据集上的实验证明了良好的泛化能力。",

    "en_tdlr": "An efficient lightweight network called SLP-Net is proposed for skin lesion segmentation, based on the spiking neural mechanism. It has a small number of parameters and high computation speed. Unlike the usual encoder-decoder structure, it utilizes a feature adaptation module for multi-scale information decoding. Experimental results show superior performance in accuracy and dice similarity coefficient compared to other methods, with favorable generalization ability."
