    "abstract": "arXiv:2312.14134v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Learning rewards from expert videos offers an affordable and effective solution to specify the intended behaviors for reinforcement learning tasks. In this work, we propose Diffusion Reward, a novel framework that learns rewards from expert videos via conditional video diffusion models for solving complex visual RL problems. Our key insight is that lower generative diversity is observed when conditioned on expert trajectories. Diffusion Reward is accordingly formalized by the negative of conditional entropy that encourages productive exploration of expert-like behaviors. We show the efficacy of our method over 10 robotic manipulation tasks from MetaWorld and Adroit with visual input and sparse reward. Moreover, Diffusion Reward could even solve unseen tasks successfully and effectively, largely surpassing baseline methods. Project page and code: https://diffusion-reward.github.io/.",

    "translated_abstract": "从专家视频中学习奖励为强化学习任务指定预期行为提供了一种经济高效的解决方案。本文提出了Diffusion Reward，这是一个通过条件视频扩散模型从专家视频中学习奖励以解决复杂视觉强化学习问题的新框架。我们的关键见解是，在专家轨迹的条件下观察到较低的生成多样性。因此，Diffusion Reward被形式化为负的条件熵，鼓励专家式行为的有效探索。我们展示了我们的方法在MetaWorld和Adroit的10个机器人操纵任务中以视觉输入和稀疏奖励的有效性。此外，Diffusion Reward甚至能够成功有效地解决未见过的任务，大大超越了基线方法。项目页面和代码：https://diffusion-reward.github.io/。",
