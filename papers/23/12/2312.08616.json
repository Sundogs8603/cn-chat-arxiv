    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究揭示了GNN和扩散过程之间的联系，这激发了许多基于扩散的GNN的提出。然而，由于这两种机制密切相关，一个基本的问题自然地产生：是否存在一个可以正式统一这些GNN的通用扩散框架？这个问题的答案不仅可以加深我们对GNN学习过程的理解，而且还可能打开一个设计广泛新的GNN类别的新大门。在本文中，我们提出了一个带有保真度项的通用扩散方程框架，它正式建立了扩散过程与更多GNN之间的关系。同时，通过这个框架，我们确定了图扩散网络的一个特征，即当前神经扩散过程只对应于一阶扩散方程。然而，通过实验证明，高阶邻居的标签实际上表现出单一性特征，这引发了相似性。",
