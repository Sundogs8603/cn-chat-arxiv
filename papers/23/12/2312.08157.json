    "translated_abstract": "后续解释领域中的最小特征删除问题旨在识别最小特征集（MFS）。先前的研究使用贪婪算法计算最小特征集时缺乏对特征交互作用的探索，而在一般情况下无法满足单调性假设。为了解决上述限制，我们提出了一种合作式集成动态修正方法（CIDR）来高效地发现最小特征集。具体而言，我们设计了合作式集成梯度（CIG）来检测特征之间的交互作用。通过将CIG与最小特征集的特征特性相结合，将最小特征删除问题转化为一个背包问题。此外，我们还设计了辅助最小特征修正算法来从众多候选集中确定最小特征集。据我们所知，我们的工作是在自然语言处理领域中首次提出了最小特征删除问题。",
