    "translated_abstract": "在快速发展的医疗行业中，平台现在不仅可以访问传统的医疗记录，还可以获取涵盖各种患者互动的各种数据集，例如来自医疗网站的数据。为了解决这种丰富的数据多样性，我们引入了WellFactor：一种通过整合这些来源信息来得出患者分类的方法。我们方法的核心是利用受约束的低秩逼近。WellFactor被优化为处理医疗数据中经常存在的稀疏性。此外，通过结合特定任务的标签信息，我们的方法改进了嵌入结果，提供了更加明智的患者视角。WellFactor的一个重要特点是能够即时计算新的、以前未观察到的患者数据的嵌入，消除了重新访问整个数据集或重新计算嵌入的需要。对实际医疗数据进行全面评估证明了WellFactor的有效性。",
