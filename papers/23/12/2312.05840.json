Using TDA tools such as persistent homology and Mapper, we delve into the intricate structures and behaviors of neural networks and their datasets. We discuss different strategies to obtain topological information from data and neural networks by means of TDA. Additionally, we review how topological information can be leveraged to analyze properties of neural networks, such as their generalization capacity or expressivity. We explore practical implications of deep learning, specifically focusing on areas like adversarial detection and model selection. Our survey organizes the examined works into four broad domains: 1. Characterization of neural network architectures; 2. Analysis of decision regions and boundaries; 3. Study of internal representations, activations, and parameters; 4. Exploration of training dynamics and loss functions. Within each category,",
