    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method for demand forecasting in a pricing context. Here, modeling the causal relationship between price as an input variable to demand is crucial because retailers aim to set prices in a (profit) optimal manner in a downstream decision making problem. Our methods bring together the Double Machine Learning methodology for causal inference and state-of-the-art transformer-based forecasting models. In extensive empirical experiments, we show on the one hand that our method estimates the causal effect better in a fully controlled setting via synthetic, yet realistic data. On the other hand, we demonstrate on real-world data that our method outperforms forecasting methods in off-policy settings (i.e., when there's a change in the pricing policy) while only slightly trailing in the on-policy setting.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种在定价环境下进行需求预测的新方法。在这种情况下，建模价格作为需求的输入变量之间的因果关系至关重要，因为零售商的目标是以（利润）最佳方式设定价格，以解决下游决策问题。我们的方法将因果推断的双重机器学习方法和最先进的基于变压器的预测模型结合在一起。通过大量的实证实验，我们一方面展示了我们的方法在完全控制的情况下对合成的、但现实的数据更好地估计因果效应。另一方面，我们还展示了在实际数据中，我们的方法在离线政策设置（即定价政策发生变化时）中优于其他预测方法，而在在线政策设置中略有落后。",
