With PvP, we approach the collection of robotic object placement demonstrations by reversing the grasping process and exploiting the inherent symmetry of the pick and place problems. Specifically, we obtain placing demonstrations from a set of grasp sequences of objects initially located at their target placement locations. Our system can collect hundreds of demonstrations in contact-constrained environments without human intervention by combining two modules: tactile regrasping and compliant control for grasps.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种通过拾取（PvP）的放置方法，可以自主收集适用于一系列放置任务的现实世界演示，其中物体必须被操纵到特定的接触限制位置。通过PvP，我们通过颠倒抓取过程并利用拾取和放置问题固有的对称性，接近于机器人物体放置演示的收集。具体而言，我们从一组最初位于目标放置位置的物体的抓取序列中获得放置演示。我们的系统可以在接触受限环境中收集数百个演示，而无需人类干预，这是通过结合两个模块实现的：触觉重新抓取和用于抓取的顺从控制。我们通过行为克隆直接从视觉观察中通过自主收集的演示中训练策略。通过这样做，策略可以推广到超出训练环境范围的物体放置场景。",
