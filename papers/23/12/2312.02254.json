    "translated_abstract": "农作物产量的全球预测是农业研究中一个至关重要的目标。因此，该研究实施了6个回归模型（线性、决策树、梯度下降、梯度提升、K最近邻和随机森林），以预测37个发展中国家27年的农作物产量。在给定4个关键的训练参数（杀虫剂量（吨）、降雨量（mm）、温度（摄氏度）和产量（hg/ha））的情况下，发现我们的随机森林回归模型达到了0.94的确定系数（r2），误差边际（ME）为0.03。这些模型使用联合国粮食和农业组织的数据以及世界银行气候变化数据目录进行训练和测试。此外，分析了每个参数，以了解不同因素如何影响总体产量。我们使用了与通常使用的深度学习（DL）和机器学习（ML）模型相反的非传统模型。",
