    "abstract": "Objective: Prediction models are popular in medical research and practice. By predicting an outcome of interest for specific patients, these models may help inform difficult treatment decisions, and are often hailed as the poster children for personalized, data-driven healthcare. Many prediction models are deployed for decision support based on their prediction accuracy in validation studies. We investigate whether this is a safe and valid approach.   Materials and Methods: We show that using prediction models for decision making can lead to harmful decisions, even when the predictions exhibit good discrimination after deployment. These models are harmful self-fulfilling prophecies: their deployment harms a group of patients but the worse outcome of these patients does not invalidate the predictive power of the model.   Results: Our main result is a formal characterization of a set of such prediction models. Next we show that models that are well calibrated before and after deployment ",

    "translated_abstract": "目标：预测模型在医学研究和实践中非常受欢迎。通过为特定患者预测感兴趣的结果，这些模型可以帮助决策困难的治疗决策，并且通常被誉为个性化的、数据驱动的医疗保健的杰出代表。许多预测模型在验证研究中基于其预测准确性而部署用于决策支持。我们调查这是否是一种安全和有效的方法。材料和方法：我们展示了使用预测模型进行决策可以导致有害的决策，即使在部署后这些预测表现出良好的区分度。这些模型是有害的自我实现预言：它们的部署损害了一群患者，但这些患者的更糟糕的结果并不使模型的预测能力无效。结果：我们的主要结果是对这些预测模型集合的形式化描述。接下来，我们展示了在部署前后都进行了良好校准的模型",
