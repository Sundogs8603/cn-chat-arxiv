    "abstract": "We introduce a novel class of risk measures designed for the management of systemic risk in networks. In contrast to prevailing approaches, these risk measures target the topological configuration of the network in order to mitigate the propagation risk of contagious threats. While our discussion primarily revolves around the management of systemic cyber risks in digital networks, we concurrently draw parallels to risk management of other complex systems where analogous approaches may be adequate.",
