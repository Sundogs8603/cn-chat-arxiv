However, most approaches encounter significant limitations when generating large-scale graphs. This is due to their requirement to output the full adjacency matrices whose size grows quadratically with the number of nodes. In response to this challenge, we introduce a new, simple, and scalable graph representation named gap encoded edge list (GEEL) that has a small representation size that aligns with the number of edges. In addition, GEEL significantly reduces the vocabulary size by incorporating the gap encoding and bandwidth restriction schemes. GEEL can be autoregressively generated with the incorporation of node positional encoding, and we further extend GEEL to deal with attributed graphs by designing a new grammar",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，人们对利用神经网络进行图生成产生了浓厚兴趣，这是一个具有关键应用价值的基本统计学习问题，如分子设计和社区分析。然而，大多数方法在生成大规模图时遇到了重大限制。这是由于它们需要输出随着节点数量呈二次增长的完整邻接矩阵。为了应对这一挑战，我们引入了一种新的、简单且可扩展的图表示，名为间隙编码边列表（GEEL），其表示大小较小且与边数量一致。此外，GEEL通过结合间隙编码和带宽限制方案显著减少了词汇量。通过加入节点位置编码，GEEL可以自回归生成，我们进一步将GEEL扩展到处理属性图，设计了一种新的语法。",
