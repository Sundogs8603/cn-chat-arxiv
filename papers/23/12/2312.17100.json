    "translated_abstract": "尽管机器学习取得了显著的进展，但重点主要集中在数据获取和模型创建上。然而，在实际环境中全面评估机器学习解决方案需要整个流程的标准化。这种需求在时间序列预测中尤为迫切，因为不同的设置妨碍了各种方法之间的有意义的比较。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了一种统一的基准测试框架，该框架公开了开发时间序列预测模型所涉及的关键建模和机器学习决策。该框架促进了模型和数据集的无缝集成，帮助从业者和研究人员开展他们的开发工作。我们在该框架内对最近提出的模型进行基准测试，证明了精心实施的深度学习模型可以与需要大量特征工程和专家知识的梯度提升决策树相媲美，而只需付出最小的努力。",
