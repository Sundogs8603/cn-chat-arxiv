To help existing PLL methods identify and rectify mislabeled samples, in this paper, we introduce a novel partner classifier and propose a novel ``mutual supervision'' paradigm.

    "translated_abstract": "在部分标签学习中，每个实例与一组候选标签相关联，其中只有一个是真实标签。现有的工作大多关注构建强大的分类器来估计候选标签的标签置信度，以识别正确的标签。然而，这些方法通常很难纠正错误标记的样本。为了帮助现有的部分标签学习方法识别和纠正错误标记的样本，在本文中，我们引入了一种新的合作伙伴分类器，并提出了一种新的“互相监督”范式。具体来说，我们根据隐含的事实实例化了合作伙伴分类器，即一个样本的非候选标签不应该被分配给它，这在部分标签学习中具有内在的准确性并且尚未得到充分研究。此外，我们还提出了一个新的协作项来将基础分类器和合作伙伴分类器链接起来。在每个互相监督的阶段中，两个分类器将通过一个模糊机制互相模糊彼此的预测。",
