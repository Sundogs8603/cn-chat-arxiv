    "translated_abstract": "通过个性化对话代理可以提高对话的质量并增加用户的参与度。然而，它们通常缺乏外部知识以适应用户的个性。这对于实际应用，如心理健康支持、饮食计划、文化敏感对话或减少对话代理中的有毒行为尤为重要。为了提高个性化响应的相关性和全面性，我们提出了一个两步方法，包括(1)有选择性地集成用户人物和(2)使用背景知识源补充信息来给响应提供上下文。我们开发了K-PERM(知识引导的个性化与奖励调控)，它是一个动态对话代理，结合了这些元素。K-PERM在流行的FoCus数据集上实现了最先进的性能，该数据集包含有关全球地标的真实个性化对话。我们证明使用K-PERM的响应可以改进对话体验。",
