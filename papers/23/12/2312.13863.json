    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶车辆需要预测周围车辆的轨迹，以确保在不确定和复杂的交通情况下进行安全操作。随着公司在现实世界中越来越多地应用轨迹预测，安全性变得越来越重要。本文着重研究后门——一种在其他领域被认可的安全威胁，但在轨迹预测中迄今被忽视。为此，我们描述并研究了四个可能影响轨迹预测的触发器。然后，我们展示了这些触发器（例如，刹车车辆），当与训练过程中的期望输出（例如，转弯）相关时，会导致最先进的轨迹预测模型的期望输出。换句话说，该模型在正常情况下表现良好，但容易受到后门攻击的影响。即使触发操纵是由目标车辆后面的非正常代理执行的，这种情况也适用。作为副作用，我们的分析揭示了轨迹预测模型中的有趣局限性。",
