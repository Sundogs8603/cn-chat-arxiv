    "translated_abstract": "许多自主系统面临安全挑战，需要强大的闭环控制来处理物理限制和安全约束。现实世界中的系统，如自主船只，遇到非线性动力学和环境扰动。强化学习越来越多地用于适应复杂场景，但缺乏确保安全和稳定性的标准框架。预测安全过滤器（PSF）提供了一种有希望的解决方案，确保在基于学习的控制中满足约束条件而无需显式约束处理。这种模块化方法允许使用任意的控制策略，安全过滤器优化所提议的动作以满足物理和安全约束。我们将这种方法应用于海上导航，将RL与PSF结合在一个模拟的Cybership II模型上。RL代理经过路径跟踪和避碰训练，而PSF监视并修改控制动作以确保安全。结果表明，PSF能够在不牺牲性能的情况下有效确保安全性。",
