    "translated_abstract": "联合学习已广泛应用于各个领域，传统的中心化联合学习系统存在严重问题。为了解决这些问题，最近引入了去中心化联合学习系统。通过使用区块链技术，它们试图提高完整性和效率。然而，隐私保护仍然是这些系统中未解决的问题。为了解决这个问题，并扩展基于区块链的计算，我们提出了一种基于零知识证明的聚合器（zkDFL）。这使得客户端可以将其大规模模型参数与可信的中心化服务器共享，同时不向其他客户端透露其个体数据。我们利用区块链技术通过智能合约管理聚合算法。服务器执行零知识证明算法，向客户端证明聚合是根据接受的算法执行的。此外，服务器可以证明来自客户端的所有输入都是合法的。",
