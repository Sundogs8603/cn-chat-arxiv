There are few cases of using eye movement to study linguistic landscape. This paper uses eye tracking technology to study the actual fixation of the linguistic landscape and finds that in the two dimensions of fixation time and fixation times, the fixation of native Chinese speakers to the linguistic landscape is higher than that of the general landscape. This paper argues that this phenomenon is due to the higher information density of linguistic landscapes. At the same time, the article also discusses other possible reasons for this phenomenon.",

    "translated_abstract": "语言景观是社会语言学研究中的一个重要领域，眼动追踪技术是心理学研究中常用的技术。在对语言景观的研究中，很少使用眼动追踪来进行研究。本文利用眼动追踪技术研究了母语为汉语的人对语言景观的实际注意点，并发现在凝视时间和凝视次数这两个维度上，母语为汉语的人对语言景观的关注程度高于一般景观。本文认为这种现象是由于语言景观的信息密度较高。同时，本文还讨论了这一现象的其他可能原因。",
