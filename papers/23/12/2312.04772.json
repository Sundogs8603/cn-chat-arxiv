    "abstract": "arXiv:2312.04772v3 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Fair decision making has largely been studied with respect to a single decision. In this paper we investigate the notion of fairness in the context of sequential decision making where multiple stakeholders can be affected by the outcomes of decisions. We observe that fairness often depends on the history of the sequential decision-making process, and in this sense that it is inherently non-Markovian. We further observe that fairness often needs to be assessed at time points within the process, not just at the end of the process. To advance our understanding of this class of fairness problems, we explore the notion of non-Markovian fairness in the context of sequential decision making. We identify properties of non-Markovian fairness, including notions of long-term, anytime, periodic, and bounded fairness. We further explore the interplay between non-Markovian fairness and memory, and how this can support construction of fair policies",

    "translated_abstract": "公平的决策制定在很大程度上是针对单一决策进行研究的。本文在多个利益相关者可能受到决策结果影响的情况下，研究了顺序决策中的公平概念。我们观察到，公平往往取决于顺序决策过程的历史，从这个意义上讲，它是固有的非马尔可夫性。我们进一步观察到，公平通常需要在过程中的某个时间点进行评估，而不仅仅是在过程结束时。为了推进我们对这类公平性问题的理解，我们探讨了顺序决策背景下非马尔可夫公平的概念。我们确定了非马尔可夫公平的属性，包括长期公平性、任意时刻公平性、周期性公平性和有界公平性等概念。我们进一步探讨了非马尔可夫公平性和记忆之间的相互作用，以及这如何支持制定公平政策。",
