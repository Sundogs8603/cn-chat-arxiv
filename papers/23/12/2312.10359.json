    "translated_abstract": "随着今天设备中越来越强大的计算能力和资源，传统上在云端执行的计算密集型自动语音识别(ASR)正从云端转移到设备上以更好地保护用户隐私。然而，在资源受限的设备上实现本地ASR仍然具有挑战性，例如智能手机、智能可穿戴设备和其他小型家居自动化设备。本文提出了一系列模型架构调整、神经网络图变换和数值优化，以在资源受限设备上适配先进的基于Conformer的端到端流式ASR系统，而不降低准确性。我们在小型可穿戴设备上实现了超过实时5.26倍快（0.19 RTF）的语音识别，同时最大限度地减少能耗并实现了最先进的准确性。所提出的方法广泛适用于其他基于变换器的无服务器AI应用。",
