    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于文本引导的可缩放矢量图形（SVG）合成在图标设计和草图等领域展示出了潜力。然而，现有的文本到SVG生成方法存在缺乏可编辑性、视觉质量和结果多样性不足的问题。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一种新颖的基于文本引导的矢量图形合成方法，称为SVGDreamer。SVGDreamer整合了一种语义驱动的图像矢量化（SIVE）过程，可以将合成过程分解为前景对象和背景，从而增强了可编辑性。具体而言，SIVE过程引入了基于注意力的基本元素控制和注意力掩蔽损失函数，以有效控制和操作各个元素。此外，我们提出了一种基于矢量化粒子分数蒸馏（VPSD）的方法，以解决现有文本到SVG生成方法中颜色过饱和、矢量基元过平滑和结果多样性有限的挑战。",
