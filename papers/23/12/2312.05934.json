    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在其预训练的权重中封装了大量的事实信息，正如它们能够在不同领域回答各种问题所证明的那样。然而，这种知识本质上是有限的，很大程度上依赖于训练数据的特性。因此，使用外部数据集来整合新的信息或改进LLMs在已见信息上的能力面临着重大挑战。在这个研究中，我们比较了两种常见的方法：无监督的微调和检索增强生成（RAG）。我们在不同主题的各种知识密集型任务上评估了这两种方法。我们的发现表明，虽然无监督的微调能够提供一定的改进，但RAG在现有知识和完全新知识上始终表现出更好的性能。此外，我们发现LLMs很难通过无监督的微调来学习新的事实信息，并且暴露",
