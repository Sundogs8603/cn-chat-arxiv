In this work, we investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a tool to optimize the effectiveness of such systems. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce a novel RL environment enabling the evaluation of the effectiveness of heat alert policies to reduce heat-related hospitalizations. The rewards model is trained from a comprehensive dataset of historical weather, Medicare health records, and socioeconomic/geographic features. We use variational Bayesian techniques to address low-signal effects and spatial heterogeneity, which are commonly encountered in climate & health settings. The transition model incorporates real historical weather patterns enriched by a data augmentation mechanism based on climate region similarity. Second, we use this env",
