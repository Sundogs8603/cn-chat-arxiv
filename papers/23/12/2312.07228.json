    "abstract": "The detection of toxic language in the Arabic language has emerged as an active area of research in recent years, and reviewing the existing datasets employed for training the developed solutions has become a pressing need. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of Arabic datasets focused on online toxic language. We systematically gathered a total of 54 available datasets and their corresponding papers and conducted a thorough analysis, considering 18 criteria across four primary dimensions: availability details, content, annotation process, and reusability. This analysis enabled us to identify existing gaps and make recommendations for future research works. For the convenience of the research community, the list of the analysed datasets is maintained in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/Imene1/Arabic-toxic-language).",
