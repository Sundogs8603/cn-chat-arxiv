    "abstract": "arXiv:2312.10170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Automation systems that can autonomously drive application user interfaces to complete user tasks are of great benefit, especially when users are situationally or permanently impaired. Prior automation systems do not produce generalizable models while AI-based automation agents work reliably only in simple, hand-crafted applications or incur high computation costs. We propose UINav, a demonstration-based approach to train automation agents that fit mobile devices, yet achieving high success rates with modest numbers of demonstrations. To reduce the demonstration overhead, UINav uses a referee model that provides users with immediate feedback on tasks where the agent fails, and automatically augments human demonstrations to increase diversity in training data. Our evaluation shows that with only 10 demonstrations UINav can achieve 70% accuracy, and that with enough demonstrations it can surpass 90% accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "具有自主驱动应用程序用户界面以完成用户任务的自动化系统，尤其是当用户处于情境性或永久性受损时，具有巨大的益处。之前的自动化系统不能产生具有普遍适用性的模型，而基于人工智能的自动化代理仅在简单的手工制作应用程序中可靠工作，或者会产生高计算成本。我们提出了UINav，这是一种基于演示的方法，用于训练适合移动设备的自动化代理，同时可以在演示数量不多的情况下实现高成功率。为了减少演示的工作量，UINav使用了一个裁判模型，在代理失败的任务上为用户提供即时反馈，并自动增加人类演示以增加训练数据的多样性。我们的评估表明，仅需10次演示，UINav就可以实现70%的准确率，而有足够多次演示时，它可以超过90%的准确率。",
