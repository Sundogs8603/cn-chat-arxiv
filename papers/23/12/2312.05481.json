    "abstract": "How does Artificial Intelligence (AI) affect the organization of work? We study this question in a model where heterogeneous agents--humans and bots--endogenously sort into hierarchical firms: Less knowledgeable agents become \"workers\" (i.e., execute routine tasks), while more knowledgeable agents becomes \"managers\" (i.e., specialize in problem solving). When AI's knowledge is that of a pre-AI worker, AI (i) displaces humans from routine to managerial work, (ii) decreases both the size of the largest firms and the productivity of the least productive firms, (iii) increases the span of control of all but the most knowledgeable managers, and (iv) decreases the productivity of all workers, as it worsens the quality of their managers. The first two results are reversed when AI has the knowledge of a pre-AI manager, but not the last two: In that case, AI increases the span of control of all managers and decreases the productivity of all but the least knowledgeable workers.

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能如何影响工作组织？我们在一个模型中研究这个问题，该模型中存在异质代理人——人类和机器人——自发地分配到等级制度的企业中：知识较低的代理人成为“工人”（执行常规任务），而知识较高的代理人则成为“管理者”（专注于问题解决）。当人工智能的知识与人工智能之前的工人相同时，人工智能(i)将人类从常规工作转移到管理工作，(ii)减小最大企业的规模和最低生产率企业的生产率，(iii)增加除最具知识的管理者之外的所有管理者的控制范围，以及(iv)降低所有工人的生产力，因为它恶化了他们的管理者的质量。当人工智能具有人工智能之前的管理者的知识时，前两个结果将被颠倒，但后两个结果不会颠倒：在这种情况下，人工智能增加了所有管理者的控制范围，降低了除最不知识渊博的工人之外的所有工人的生产力。人工智能创造了优胜者。",
    "tldr": "人工智能的知识对工作组织有着巨大的影响，当其知识与之前的工人相同时，它将导致人类从常规工作转移到管理工作，减小企业规模和生产率，同时也降低员工和管理者的生产力。当其知识与之前的管理者相同时，它会增加管理者的控制范围，但降低工人的生产力。人工智能在知识经济中引发了输赢局面。",
    "en_tdlr": "The knowledge of artificial intelligence has a huge impact on work organization. When its knowledge is the same as pre-AI workers, it displaces humans to managerial work, decreases firm size and productivity, and reduces the productivity of workers and managers. When its knowledge is the same as pre-AI managers, it increases managers' span of control but decreases worker productivity. Artificial intelligence creates winners and losers in the knowledge economy."
