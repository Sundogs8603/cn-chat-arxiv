    "translated_abstract": "天气预报系统对科学和社会至关重要，在将人工智能（AI）应用于中期天气预报方面取得了重大成就。然而，现有的基于AI的天气预报模型依赖于传统数值天气预报（NWP）系统的分析或再分析产品作为预测的初始条件。初始状态通常由传统数据同化组件生成，这是计算昂贵且耗时。本文提出了一种基于AI的数据同化模型，即Adas，用于全球天气变量。我们将Adas与先进的基于AI的天气预报模型（即FengWu）结合起来，构建了第一个端到端基于AI的全球天气预报系统：FengWu-Adas。我们证明了Adas能够同化稀疏的全球观测数据，产生高质量的分析结果，使系统能够稳定运行。",
