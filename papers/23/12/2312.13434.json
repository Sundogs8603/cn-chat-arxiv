    "translated_abstract": "认知诊断通过探索学生的练习测验数据来估计他们的认知状态。它在智能教育系统中的个性化学习指导中起着关键作用。本文关注一个重要但常常被忽视的任务：领域级零样本认知诊断（DZCD），因为在新启动的领域中缺乏学生的练习记录而产生。最近的跨领域诊断模型已经证明是DZCD的一种有前途的策略。这些方法主要关注如何在领域之间传递学生状态。然而，它们可能会无意中将不可转移的信息融入到学生的表示中，从而限制了知识传输的效果。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了Zero-1-to-3，一种基于领域级零样本认知诊断框架，通过一批早鸟学生实现三个诊断目标。我们的方法首先使用预训练的诊断模型进行训练。",
