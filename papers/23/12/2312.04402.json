    "translated_abstract": "语义分割使得机器人能够对其环境进行感知和推理，超出了几何学的范畴。大多数这类系统建立在深度学习方法的基础上。由于自主机器人通常部署在初始未知环境中，对静态数据集进行预训练不能总是捕捉到多样的领域，限制了机器人在任务中的感知性能。最近出现了一些自监督和完全监督的主动学习方法来改进机器人的视觉。这些方法依赖于大规模的领域内预训练数据集，或者需要大量人工标注的工作。我们提出了一种基于地图的自适应路径规划方法，用于半监督的语义分割主动学习，相比完全监督方法，极大地减少了人工标注的需求。我们利用自适应路径规划器来引导机器人探索未知空间的边界，并收集具有高模型不确定性的训练数据进行人工标注。我们方法的一个关键方面是结合了稀疏的",
