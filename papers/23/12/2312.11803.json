Healthcare faces existing challenges including the balance of power in clinician-patient relationships, systemic health disparities, historical injustices, and economic constraints. Drawing directly from the voices of those most affected, and focusing on a case study of a specific healthcare setting, we propose a set of guiding principles for the use of NLP in maternal healthcare. We led an interactive session centered on an LLM-based chatbot demonstration during a full-day workshop with 39 participants, and additionally surveyed 30 healthcare workers and 30 birthing people about their values, needs, and perceptions of NLP tools in the context of maternal health. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analyses of the survey results and interactive discussions to consolidate our findings into a set of",

    "translated_abstract": "迫切需要伦理框架来指导如何利用大型语言模型（LLMs）等工具进行医疗应用的自然语言处理（NLP）。医疗领域面临着权力平衡、系统性健康差距、历史不公和经济限制等挑战。在直接倾听最受影响者的声音的基础上，并以某一特定医疗环境的案例研究为重点，我们提出了一套在母婴健康领域中使用NLP的指导原则。我们在一个为期一天的研讨会上，组织了一个以LLM为基础的聊天机器人演示的互动会话，并额外调查了30名医疗工作者和30名分娩者对于母婴健康背景下NLP工具的价值、需求和感知。我们对调查结果和互动讨论进行了定量和定性分析，总结出了我们的研究结果。",
