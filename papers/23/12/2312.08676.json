    "abstract": "Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transfer the source speaker timbre to arbitrary unseen target speaker timbre, while keeping the linguistic content unchanged. Although the voice of generated speech can be controlled by providing the speaker embedding of the target speaker, the speaker similarity still lags behind the ground truth recordings. In this paper, we propose SEF-VC, a speaker embedding free voice conversion model, which is designed to learn and incorporate speaker timbre from reference speech via a powerful position-agnostic cross-attention mechanism, and then reconstruct waveform from HuBERT semantic tokens in a non-autoregressive manner. The concise design of SEF-VC enhances its training stability and voice conversion performance. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superiority of SEF-VC to generate high-quality speech with better similarity to target reference than strong zero-shot VC baselines, even for very short reference speeches.",

    "translated_abstract": "零样本语音转换旨在将源说话人的音色转换为任意未见过的目标说话人的音色，同时保持语言内容不变。尽管通过提供目标说话人的说话人嵌入可以控制生成语音的说话人相似性，但说话人相似性仍然落后于真实录音。在本文中，我们提出了SEF-VC，一种无说话人嵌入的语音转换模型，通过强大的位置无关的交叉注意力机制从参考语音中学习并融入说话人音色，然后以非自回归方式从HuBERT语义标记中重构波形。SEF-VC的简洁设计增强了其训练稳定性和语音转换性能。客观和主观评估证明，SEF-VC优于强零样本语音转换基线，能够生成与目标参考的更高相似性的高质量语音，即使对于很短的参考语音。",
