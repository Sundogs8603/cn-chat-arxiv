    "translated_abstract": "多变量时间序列中的异常检测在单类分类设置中得到了广泛研究。在单类分类中，训练样本被假设为正常，这在实际情况下很难保证。这种情况可能降低基于单类分类的异常检测方法的性能，因为它们将训练分布拟合为正态分布。在本文中，我们提出了MTGFlow，一种通过动态图和实体感知的归一化流进行多变量时间序列异常检测的无监督方法。MTGFlow首先估计整个训练样本的密度，然后根据测试样本在拟合分布内的密度识别异常实例。这依赖于一个被广泛接受的假设，即异常实例的密度比正常实例更稀疏，不依赖于清洁的训练数据集。然而，由于实体之间的复杂依赖关系和它们的多样性，直接估计密度是困难的。",
