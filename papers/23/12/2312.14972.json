    "translated_abstract": "许多公司依赖于管理的AI模型的API，如OpenAI的GPT-4，以在其产品中创建AI增强体验。除了使用便利和缩短生产时间的好处外，依赖专有API还具有模型控制、性能可靠性、上线可预测性和成本方面的缺点。与此同时，已经涌现了许多供商业使用的开源小型语言模型（SLMs）。然而，它们替代现有能力的准备情况尚不清楚，并且没有现成的系统方法来测试这些模型。在本文中，我们提出了一种系统的评估方法，该方法对现代开源SLMs及其在替代真实产品功能的专有LLM APIs时所做的权衡进行了表征。我们设计了一个名为SLaM的自动化分析工具，使得可以定量和定性地测试使用任意SLMs的产品功能。使用SLaM，我们对机器人进行了检验。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种系统的评估方法来比较专有LLMs和开源SLMs的权衡，并设计了一个自动化分析工具SLaM来测试产品功能。在实际产品功能替换时，对于现有能力是否能够被开源SLMs代替，还需要进一步研究。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a systematic evaluation methodology for comparing proprietary LLMs and open source SLMs, and introduces an automated analysis tool called SLaM to test product features. Further research is needed to determine if existing capabilities can be replaced by open source SLMs when replacing real-world product features."
