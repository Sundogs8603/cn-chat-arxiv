In this paper, we explore the attribution of transcribed speech, which poses novel challenges. The main challenge is that many stylistic features, such as punctuation and capitalization, are not informative in this setting. On the other hand, transcribed speech exhibits other patterns, such as filler words and backchannels (e.g., 'um', 'uh-huh'), which may be characteristic of different speakers. We propose a new benchmark for speaker attribution focused on conversational speech transcripts. To limit spurious associations of speakers with topic, we employ both conversation prompts and speakers participating in the same conversation to construct verification trials of varying difficulties. We establish the state of the art on this new benchmark by comparing a suite of",

    "translated_abstract": "作者归属验证是确定两个不同书面样本是否同属一作者的任务，通常涉及对书面文本的归因。本文探讨了转录演讲的归属问题，这带来了新的挑战。其中一个主要挑战是，许多文体特征，如标点和大写，在这种情境下并不具备信息量。另一方面，转录的演讲呈现其他模式，如填充词和回应性声音（例如“嗯”，“嗯，嗯”），这些可能是不同发言人的特征性表现。我们提出了一个新的以会话演讲文本为重点的发言人归属基准。为了限制发言人与话题之间的虚假关联，我们使用会话提示和参与同一对话的发言人构建不同难度的验证试验。通过比较一系列方法，在这一新基准上建立了最新技术水平。",
