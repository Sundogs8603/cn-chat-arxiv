    "translated_abstract": "正交时频空间（OTFS）是高运动性场景下无线通信的一种有前途的调制方案。最近，一种基于储层计算（RC）的方法已经引入到OTFS系统中的在线子帧符号检测中，该方法只利用了有限数量的空中（OTA）导频符号用于训练。然而，这种方法没有充分利用OTFS系统特定的领域知识，无法充分发挥RC的潜力。本文介绍一种新颖的二维RC（2D-RC）方法，将OTFS系统的领域知识结合到在线子帧符号检测的设计中。具体而言，由于延迟-多普勒（DD）域中的信道相互作用是一个二维（2D）的循环操作，2D-RC被设计为具有2D循环填充过程和2D滤波结构以嵌入此知识。通过引入这种架构，2D-RC可以在DD域中仅使用一个单一的导频符号操作。",
