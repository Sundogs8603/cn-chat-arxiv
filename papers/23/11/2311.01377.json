    "translated_abstract": "直布罗陀海峡是一个由地形、潮汐力、不稳定性和非线性水力过程影响的复杂海洋亚中尺度特征区域，所有这些都受非线性流体运动方程管控。本研究旨在通过3D MIT通用环流模型模拟，包括波浪、涡旋和旋回，揭示这些现象背后的物理机制。为了实现这一目标，我们采用动态模态分解（DMD）将模拟快照分解成Koopman模态，具有不同的指数增长/衰减率和振荡频率。我们的目标包括评估DMD在捕捉已知特征、揭示新元素、排名模态和探索降阶的效果。我们还引入了一些修改来增强DMD的稳健性、数值精度和特征值的稳健性。DMD分析产生了对流动模式、内波形成和直布罗陀海峡动力学的全面了解。",
