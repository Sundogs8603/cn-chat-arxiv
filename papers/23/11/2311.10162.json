    "abstract": "arXiv:2311.10162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Deep learning-based MRI reconstruction models have achieved superior performance these days. Most recently, diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in image generation, in-painting, super-resolution, image editing and more. As a generalized diffusion model, cold diffusion further broadens the scope and considers models built around arbitrary image transformations such as blurring, down-sampling, etc. In this paper, we propose a k-space cold diffusion model that performs image degradation and restoration in k-space without the need for Gaussian noise. We provide comparisons with multiple deep learning-based MRI reconstruction models and perform tests on a well-known large open-source MRI dataset. Our results show that this novel way of performing degradation can generate high-quality reconstruction images for accelerated MRI.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的MRI重建模型近年来取得了优异的表现。最近，扩散模型在图像生成、修补、超分辨率、图像编辑等方面表现出色。作为一种通用的扩散模型，冷扩散进一步拓宽了范围，并考虑了围绕任意图像变换构建的模型，例如模糊、下采样等。本文提出了一种在K空间中执行图像退化和恢复的K空间冷扩散模型，无需高斯噪声。我们与多个基于深度学习的MRI重建模型进行比较，并在一个知名的大型开源MRI数据集上进行测试。我们的结果表明，这种新颖的退化方式可以为加速MRI生成高质量的重建图像。",
