We show that kernel integral operators are contractions with respect to suitable specifications of such metrics even for kernels which are not bounded away from zero, provided that the decay to zero of the kernel is controlled. As an application to entropic optimal transport, we show exponential convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm in settings where the marginal distributions have sufficiently light tails compared to the growth of the cost function.",

    "translated_abstract": "受无界环境中的熵最优传输问题的启发，我们研究了有界增长可积函数空间的Hilbert投影度量版本。这些Hilbert度量版本源自锥体，这些锥体是所有非负函数的松弛，即它们包括所有在与某些测试函数相乘时具有非负积分值的函数。我们证明了内核积分算子在适当的度量规范下是压缩映射，即使内核没有与零间隔，前提是内核趋向于零受控制。作为熵最优传输的应用，我们证明了在边际分布的尾部相对于成本函数的增长足够轻时，Sinkhorn算法呈指数收敛的性质。",
