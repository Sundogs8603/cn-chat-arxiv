    "abstract": "Intensive Care Units (ICU) provide close supervision and continuous care to patients with life-threatening conditions. However, continuous patient assessment in the ICU is still limited due to time constraints and the workload on healthcare providers. Existing patient assessments in the ICU such as pain or mobility assessment are mostly sporadic and administered manually, thus introducing the potential for human errors. Developing Artificial intelligence (AI) tools that can augment human assessments in the ICU can be beneficial for providing more objective and granular monitoring capabilities. For example, capturing the variations in a patient's facial cues related to pain or agitation can help in adjusting pain-related medications or detecting agitation-inducing conditions such as delirium. Additionally, subtle changes in visual cues during or prior to adverse clinical events could potentially aid in continuous patient monitoring when combined with high-resolution physiological signal",

    "translated_abstract": "重症监护室（ICU）为患有生命威胁的患者提供密切监护和连续护理。然而，由于时间限制和医疗保健工作者的工作负荷，ICU中的连续患者评估仍然有限。现有的ICU患者评估，如疼痛或活动能力评估，大多是零散和手动实施的，从而引入了人为错误的潜在可能性。开发能够增强ICU中人类评估的人工智能（AI）工具可以有利于提供更客观和详细的监测能力。例如，捕捉与疼痛或不安相关的患者面部线索的变化可以帮助调整与疼痛相关的药物或检测可能引起不安的情况，如谵妄。此外，在不良临床事件发生期间或之前，视觉线索的微妙变化与高分辨率生理信号相结合可能有助于连续患者监测。",
