    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the internet, online social media welcomes people with different backgrounds through its diverse content. The increasing usage of emoji becomes a noticeable trend thanks to emoji's rich information beyond cultural or linguistic borders. However, the current study on emojis is limited to single emoji prediction and there are limited data resources available for further study of the interesting linguistic phenomenon. To this end, we synthesize a large text-emoji parallel corpus, Text2Emoji, from a large language model. Based on the parallel corpus, we distill a sequence-to-sequence model, EmojiLM, which is specialized in the text-emoji bidirectional translation. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks and human evaluation demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms strong baselines and the parallel corpus benefits emoji-related downstream tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着互联网的快速发展，在线社交媒体通过其多样的内容迎来了来自不同背景的人们。表情符号的使用越来越多，得益于表情符号在文化或语言边界之外的丰富信息。然而，目前关于表情符号的研究仅限于单个表情符号的预测，并且有限的数据资源可用于进一步研究这一有趣的语言现象。为此，我们从大型语言模型中合成了一个大规模的文本-表情符号并行语料库Text2Emoji。基于这个并行语料库，我们提取了一个序列到序列模型EmojiLM，专门用于文本-表情符号的双向翻译。公共基准测试和人工评估的大量实验表明，我们提出的模型优于强基准线，并且并行语料库对于与表情符号相关的下游任务有益。",
