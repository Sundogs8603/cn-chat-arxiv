    "abstract": "We present a radiology-specific multimodal model for the task for generating radiological reports from chest X-rays (CXRs). Our work builds on the idea that large language model(s) can be equipped with multimodal capabilities through alignment with pre-trained vision encoders. On natural images, this has been shown to allow multimodal models to gain image understanding and description capabilities. Our proposed model (MAIRA-1) leverages a CXR-specific image encoder in conjunction with a fine-tuned large language model based on Vicuna-7B, and text-based data augmentation, to produce reports with state-of-the-art quality. In particular, MAIRA-1 significantly improves on the radiologist-aligned RadCliQ metric and across all lexical metrics considered. Manual review of model outputs demonstrates promising fluency and accuracy of generated reports while uncovering failure modes not captured by existing evaluation practices.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种放射学特定的多模态模型，用于从胸部X光（CXR）生成放射学报告的任务。我们的工作基于一个思想，即可以通过与预训练视觉编码器对齐，使大型语言模型具备多模态能力。在自然图像上，这已被证明可以使多模态模型获得图像理解和描述能力。我们提出的模型（MAIRA-1）利用了一个CXR特定的图像编码器，结合基于Vicuna-7B的微调的大型语言模型，并进行基于文本的数据增强，以产生具有最先进质量的报告。特别地，MAIRA-1在与放射科医生对齐的RadCliQ度量和考虑的所有词汇度量上都有显著改进。对模型输出的手动审核显示出了产生报告的流畅性和准确性，同时揭示了现有评估方法所未捕捉到的失败模式。更多信息和资源可在项目网站上找到：",
