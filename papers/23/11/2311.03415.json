    "translated_abstract": "准确且高效的功率流分析对于现代电力网络的运行和规划至关重要。因此，需要能够为小型和大型电力网络提供准确和快速解的可扩展算法。由于电力网络可以被解释为一个图，图神经网络(GNNs)已经成为通过利用底层图结构的信息共享来改善功率流近似的准确性和速度的一种有前景的方法。在这项研究中，我们介绍了PowerFlowNet，一个新颖的GNN架构，用于功率流近似，在简单的IEEE 14总线系统中与传统的牛顿-拉夫逊方法展示了相似的性能，但在法国高电压网络(6470rte)的真实情况下实现了4倍的速度提升。同时，与其他传统的近似方法(如直流松弛法)相比，在性能和执行时间方面显著优于它们，从而实现了优越的表现。",
