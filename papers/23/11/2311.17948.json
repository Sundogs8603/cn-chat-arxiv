Despite the notable progress in action recognition, it is still challenging to recognize atomic activities due to a deficiency in a holistic understanding of both multiple road users' motions and their contextual information. In this paper, we introduce Action-slot, a slot attention-based approach that learns visual action-centric representations, capturing both motion and contextual information. Our key idea is to design action slots that are capable of paying attention to regions where atomic activities occur, without the need for explicit perception guidance. To further enhance slot attention, we introduce a background slot that competes with action slots, aiding the training process in avoiding unnecessary focus on background regions devoid of activities.

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们研究了多标签原子活动识别。尽管在动作识别方面取得了显著进展，但由于对多个道路用户动作及其上下文信息的整体理解不足，识别原子活动仍然具有挑战性。我们引入了一种基于槽注意力的方法——动作槽，它学习视觉动作中心表示，捕捉了动作和上下文信息。我们的关键思想是设计能够注意到原子活动发生位置的动作槽，而无需明确的感知引导。为了进一步增强槽的注意力，我们引入了一个背景槽，与动作槽竞争，有助于训练过程中避免不必要地关注缺乏活动的背景区域。然而，现有数据集中不平衡的类分布阻碍了对稀有活动的评估。",
