    "translated_abstract": "为了改善患有肺部疾病（如肺癌）的患者的预后，早期诊断和治疗至关重要。CT图像的分析对于诊断至关重要，而对于干预计划和支气管镜检查过程中的实时引导，需要对气道树进行高质量的分割。最近，多领域气道树建模（ATM'22）挑战发布了一个大型数据集，既可以训练基于深度学习的模型，又显著提高了气道分割任务的最新技术水平。然而，ATM'22数据集中只包括少数患有影响气道树解剖结构的严重病理的患者。在这项研究中，我们介绍了一个新的公共基准数据集（AeroPath），包括27个CT图像，来自患有从肺气肿到大型肿瘤等病理的患者，并附带有对应的气管和支气管注释。其次，我们提出了一种用于自动气道分割的多尺度融合设计。模型是在该数据集上训练的。",
