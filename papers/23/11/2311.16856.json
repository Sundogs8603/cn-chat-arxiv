    "translated_abstract": "近年来，图神经网络(GNNs)已成为机器学习分类任务中的重要工具。然而，它们在回归任务中的应用仍然未被充分探索。为了发掘GNNs在回归中的潜力，本文将GNNs与注意机制相结合，这是一种通过其适应性和鲁棒性彻底改变了序列学习任务的技术，以解决一个具有挑战性的非线性回归问题：网络定位。我们首先介绍了一种基于图卷积网络(GCN)的新型网络定位方法，即使在严重非直视视线(NLOS)条件下也表现出卓越的精度，从而减少了繁琐的离线校准或NLOS识别的需求。我们进一步提出了一种关注图神经网络(AGNN)模型，旨在改善基于GCN方法的有限灵活性和对超参数的高敏感性。",
