    "translated_abstract": "可逆计算是一种新兴的计算范式，允许在计算过程中任意时刻以相反的顺序执行操作序列。它具有低功耗计算的潜力，并与化学反应、量子计算、机器人技术和分布式系统等广泛应用有关。逆向Petri网是对Petri网的最近提出的扩展，实现了三种主要的可逆性形式，即回溯、因果逆转和超出因果顺序逆转。它们的特点是使用具有命名的标记，可以结合在一起形成键合。命名标记以及历史函数构成了记忆过去行为的手段，从而实现了可逆性。在最近的工作中，我们提出了从一类RPNs到彩色Petri网模型（CPNs）的结构化翻译。CPN是传统Petri网的扩展，其中标记携带数据值。",
