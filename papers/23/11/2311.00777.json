    "abstract": "This paper develops a new data-driven approach to characterizing latent worker skill and job task heterogeneity by applying an empirical tool from network theory to large-scale Brazilian administrative data on worker--job matching. We microfound this tool using a standard equilibrium model of workers matching with jobs according to comparative advantage. Our classifications identify important dimensions of worker and job heterogeneity that standard classifications based on occupations and sectors miss. The equilibrium model based on our classifications more accurately predicts wage changes in response to the 2016 Olympics than a model based on occupations and sectors. Additionally, for a large simulated shock to demand for workers, we show that reduced form estimates of the effects of labor market shock exposure on workers' earnings are nearly 4 times larger when workers and jobs are classified using our classifications as opposed to occupations and sectors.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过将网络理论的实证工具应用于巴西大规模管理数据，提出了一种新的数据驱动方法来描述潜在的工人技能和工作任务的异质性。我们使用一种标准的均衡模型将这种工具微观化，该模型根据比较优势使工人与工作匹配。我们的分类识别出标准基于职业和行业的分类忽视的工人和工作异质性的重要维度。基于我们的分类的均衡模型比基于职业和行业的模型更准确地预测了对2016年奥运会的工资变化。此外，对于一次对工人需求的大规模模拟冲击，我们表明当使用我们的分类而不是职业和行业进行工人和工作的分类时，劳动力市场冲击暴露对工人收入的影响的简化形式估计值将大约增加4倍。",
