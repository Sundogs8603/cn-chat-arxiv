    "translated_abstract": "极端多标签分类（XMLC）是从一个非常庞大的可能标签集中选择一个小子集的任务。因此，它以长尾标签为特征，即大多数标签只有很少的正实例。使用标准的性能度量如precision@k，分类器可以忽略长尾标签并仍然报告良好的性能。然而，通常认为在长尾中的正确预测更加“有趣”或“有奖励”，但学术界尚未就捕捉这个直观概念的度量方式达成共识。现有的倾向得分度量在解决长尾和丢失标签问题方面存在局限性。在本文中，我们分析了作为替代解决方案的广义度量预算“在k处”。为了解决这些度量的优化问题，我们将其制定在预期测试效用（ETU）框架中，该框架旨在优化在固定测试集上的预期性能。我们推导出最优预测规则。",
