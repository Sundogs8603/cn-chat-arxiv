    "abstract": "arXiv:2311.05227v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Deontological ethics, specifically understood through Immanuel Kant, provides a moral framework that emphasizes the importance of duties and principles, rather than the consequences of action. Understanding that despite the prominence of deontology, it is currently an overlooked approach in fairness metrics, this paper explores the compatibility of a Kantian deontological framework in fairness metrics, part of the AI alignment field. We revisit Kant's critique of utilitarianism, which is the primary approach in AI fairness metrics and argue that fairness principles should align with the Kantian deontological framework. By integrating Kantian ethics into AI alignment, we not only bring in a widely-accepted prominent moral theory but also strive for a more morally grounded AI landscape that better balances outcomes and procedures in pursuit of fairness and justice.",

    "translated_abstract": "康德的义务论即伊曼纽尔·康德理解的那种，提供了一个强调职责和原则重要性而非行动后果的道德框架。本文认为，尽管义务论颇具突出，但在公平度量领域却鲜有研究，它探讨了康德义务论框架与公平度量的兼容性，在AI对齐领域中。我们重新审视了康德对功利主义的批判，而功利主义是AI公平度量的主要方法，主张公平原则应与康德义务论框架相契合。通过将康德伦理融入AI对齐，我们不仅引入了一个被广泛接受的重要道德理论，而且努力实现一个更具道德立足的人工智能领域，更好地平衡结果和程序，追求公平与正义。",
