    "translated_abstract": "尽管高清地图是自动驾驶的关键组成部分，但它们的获取和维护成本很高。因此，从传感器估算这些地图承诺显著降低成本。然而，这些估算忽视了现有的高清地图，当前方法最多只是将低质量地图地理定位，或考虑已知地图的通用数据库。在本文中，我们建议在估算HD地图时考虑所研究情况的现有地图。我们确定了3种合理的有用现有地图类型（简约型、嘈杂型和过时型）。我们还介绍了MapEX，这是一个新颖的在线HD地图估算框架，考虑了现有地图。MapEX通过将地图元素编码为查询标记，并通过优化用于训练经典基于查询的地图估算模型的匹配算法来实现这一点。我们证明MapEX在nuScenes数据集上带来了显著的改进。",
