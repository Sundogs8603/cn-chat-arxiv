    "abstract": "A neural network with ReLU activations may be viewed as a composition of piecewise linear functions. For such networks, the number of distinct linear regions expressed over the input domain has the potential to scale exponentially with depth, but it is not expected to do so when the initial parameters are chosen randomly. This poor scaling can necessitate the use of overly large models to approximate even simple functions. To address this issue, we introduce a novel training strategy: we first reparameterize the network weights in a manner that forces an exponential number of activation patterns to manifest. Training first on these new parameters provides an initial solution that can later be refined by updating the underlying model weights. This approach allows us to produce function approximations that are several orders of magnitude better than their randomly initialized counterparts.",

    "translated_abstract": "ReLU激活的神经网络可以看作是分段线性函数的组合。对于这样的网络，随着深度的增加，表达在输入域上的不同线性区域的数量有可能以指数级增长，但当初始参数选择随机时，不太可能出现这种情况。这种不良的尺度能够导致即使是简单函数也需要使用过大的模型来近似。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种新的训练策略：首先以一种方式重新参数化网络权重，使得指数数量的激活模式得以展现。在这些新参数上进行训练可以得到一个初始解，稍后通过更新底层模型权重来改进。这种方法使我们能够产生比随机初始化对应的函数逼近好几个数量级的结果。",
