    "translated_abstract": "肺栓塞（PE）诊断对计算机断层扫描肺动脉造影（CTPA）的依赖度不断增加，这导致了对改进诊断方法的挑战和迫切需求。本研究的主要目标是利用深度学习技术提升PE的计算机辅助诊断（CAD）。为此，我们提出了一种分类器引导的检测方法，该方法通过有效利用分类器的概率推理来指导检测预测，在自动PE诊断领域提供了一种新的贡献。我们的分类系统包括一个采用注意力机制的卷积神经网络（AG-CNN），它通过使用局部上下文信息来模拟人类专家的关注，即在做出判断之前同时关注整体外貌和局部病变区域。该分类器在FUMPE数据集上展现出稳健的性能，实现了0.927的AUROC、0.862的敏感度、0.879的特异度。",
