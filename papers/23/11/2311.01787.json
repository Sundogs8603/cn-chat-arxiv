    "abstract": "The manufacturing industry sector was expected to generate new employment opportunities and take on labour. Gradually, however, it emerged as a menace to the sustenance of its workers. According to the findings of this study, 24 manufacturing subsectors with ISIC 2 digits in Indonesia exhibited regressive and abnormal patterns in the period 2012-2020. This suggests that, to a great extent, labour absorption has been limited and, in some cases, even shown a decline. Anomalous occurrences were observed in three subsectors: ISIC 12 (tobacco products), ISIC 26 (computer, electronic and optical products), and ISIC 31 (furniture). In contrast, regressive phenomena were present in the remaining 21 ISIC subsectors. Furthermore, the manufacturing industry displayed a negative correlation between employment and efficiency index, demonstrating this anomalous and regressive phenomenon. This implies that as the efficiency index of the manufacturing industry increases, the index of labour absorption",

    "translated_abstract": "制造业部门本应创造新的就业机会并吸纳劳动力。然而，逐渐出现了对劳动者生存的威胁。根据本研究的发现，2012年至2020年期间，印尼的24个2位ISIC制造业细分行业表现出倒退和异常的模式。这表明劳动吸纳在很大程度上受到限制，并且在某些情况下甚至呈现下降趋势。三个细分行业（ISIC 12烟草制品、ISIC 26计算机、电子和光学产品、ISIC 31家具）观察到异常发生，而其他21个ISIC细分行业则呈现倒退现象。此外，制造业的就业和效率指数之间存在负相关关系，表明出现了这种异常和倒退现象。",
