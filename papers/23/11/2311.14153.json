    "translated_abstract": "模仿学习（IL）可以从资源密集型的模型预测控制器（MPC）中训练计算效率高的感知动作策略，但通常需要大量样本，导致训练时间长或鲁棒性有限。为了解决这些问题，我们将IL与一种考虑过程和传感不确定性的鲁棒MPC的变体相结合，设计了一种数据增强（DA）策略，实现了基于视觉的策略的高效学习。提出的DA方法名为Tube-NeRF，利用神经辐射场（NeRFs）生成新颖的合成图像，并利用鲁棒MPC的性质（管）选择相关视图，并有效计算相应的动作。我们将方法量身定制为多旋翼上的定位和轨迹跟踪任务，通过学习一个仅使用机载摄像机图像作为水平位置唯一来源的视动作策略来生成控制动作。",
