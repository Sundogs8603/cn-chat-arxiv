    "translated_abstract": "最近，扩散模型在生成任务中取得了巨大的成功。从扩散模型中采样等价于解决反扩散随机微分方程（SDEs）或相应的概率流常微分方程（ODEs）。与之相比，基于SDE的解算器可以生成更高质量的样本，并适用于基于笔划合成的图像转换任务。然而，在推断过程中，现有的基于SDE的解算器受到效率-有效性困境的严重限制。我们的调查表明，这是因为反向转换核中的高斯假设在有限数量的离散化步骤中经常被违反（即使在简单混合数据的情况下）。为了克服这个限制，我们引入了一种新的基于SDE的解算器类，称为高斯混合解算器（GMS）用于扩散模型。我们的解算器估计了前三阶矩，并优化了高斯混合的参数",
