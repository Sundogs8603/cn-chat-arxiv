    "translated_abstract": "湍流是由于高雷诺数流体流动的强非线性动力学而形成的复杂的时空结构。尽管湍流是一个普遍存在的现象，并且已经研究了几个世纪，但对湍流的完全理解仍然是一个巨大的挑战。在这里，我们引入了量子混沌和随机矩阵理论(RMT)的工具，并对由不可压缩和可压缩流体流动产生的图像数据集进行了详细分析。我们关注两个可观察量：数据Gram矩阵和单个图像分布，研究了局部和全局特征值统计并将其与经典混沌、不相关噪声和自然图像进行了比较。我们表明，从RMT的角度来看，湍流的Gram矩阵与量子混沌而不是可积系统处于相同的普适类别中，并且数据在其特征值的大部分上表现出与不相关的经典类别完全不同的幂律缩放。",
