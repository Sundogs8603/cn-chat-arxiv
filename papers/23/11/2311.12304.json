    "abstract": "How areas of land are allocated for different uses, such as forests, urban areas, and agriculture, has a large effect on the terrestrial carbon balance, and therefore climate change. Based on available historical data on land-use changes and a simulation of the associated carbon emissions and removals, a surrogate model can be learned that makes it possible to evaluate the different options available to decision-makers efficiently. An evolutionary search process can then be used to discover effective land-use policies for specific locations. Such a system was built on the Project Resilience platform and evaluated with the Land-Use Harmonization dataset LUH2 and the bookkeeping model BLUE. It generates Pareto fronts that trade off carbon impact and amount of land-use change customized to different locations, thus providing a potentially useful tool for land-use planning.",

    "translated_abstract": "土地被分配给不同的用途，如森林、城市区域和农业，对陆地碳平衡和气候变化有重大影响。基于可用的土地利用变化的历史数据和相关的碳排放和吸收的模拟，可以学习到一个代理模型，从而能够高效评估决策者可选择的不同选项。然后可以使用进化搜索过程来发现特定位置的有效土地利用政策。该系统构建在Project Resilience平台上，并使用Land-Use Harmonization数据集LUH2和簿记模型BLUE进行评估。它生成可定制到不同位置的碳影响和土地利用变化量的帕累托前沿，从而为土地利用规划提供了一个潜在有用的工具。",
