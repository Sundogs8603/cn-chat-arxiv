    "abstract": "An informed seller designs a dynamic mechanism to sell an experience good. The seller has partial information about the product match, which affects the buyer's private consumption experience. We characterize equilibrium mechanisms of this dynamic informed principal problem. The belief gap between the informed seller and the uninformed buyer, coupled with the buyer's learning, gives rise to mechanisms that provide the skeptical buyer with limited access to the product and an option to upgrade if the buyer is swayed by a good experience. Depending on the seller's screening technology, this takes the form of free/discounted trials or tiered pricing, which are prevalent in digital markets. In contrast to static environments, having consumer data can reduce sellers' revenue in equilibrium, as they fine-tune the dynamic design with their data forecasting the buyer's learning process.",

    "translated_abstract": "一个知情的卖家设计了一个动态机制来销售一个体验好。卖家对产品匹配有部分信息，这会影响买家的私人消费体验。我们对这个动态知情主体问题的均衡机制进行了表征。知情的卖家和不知情的买家之间的信念差距，再加上买家的学习，导致了为怀疑的买家提供对产品有限访问权限的机制，并且如果买家对好的体验感到满意的话，还提供升级的选项。根据卖家的筛选技术不同，这可以采取免费/折扣试用或分层定价的形式，在数字市场中非常普遍。与静态环境相比，拥有消费者数据可以在均衡情况下减少卖家的收入，因为他们可以凭借数据预测买家的学习过程来优化动态设计。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates a dynamic informed seller problem, where limited access mechanisms are provided to skeptical buyers based on incomplete product match information and the buyer's learning process, with upgrade options depending on the buyer's experience. Different forms, such as free/discounted trials or tiered pricing, can be adopted based on the seller's screening technology. Having consumer data can help sellers optimize dynamic design, but may also result in reduced revenue compared to static environments."
