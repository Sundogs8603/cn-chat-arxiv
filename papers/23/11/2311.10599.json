Chatbots, for example, are increasingly used as social companions, and while much is speculated, little is known empirically about how their use impacts human relationships. A common hypothesis is that relationships with companion chatbots are detrimental to social health by harming or replacing human interaction, but this hypothesis may be too simplistic, especially considering the social needs of users and the health of their preexisting human relationships. To understand how relationships with companion chatbots impact social health, we studied people who regularly used companion chatbots and people who did not use them.

    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能的普及，一个问题是人工智能与人类互动如何影响人际关系。例如，聊天机器人越来越被用作社交伴侣，尽管有很多猜测，但对他们的使用如何影响人际关系知之甚少。人们普遍认为与伴侣聊天机器人的关系对社会健康有害，但这种假设可能过于简单，特别考虑到用户的社会需求和他们现有人际关系的健康。为了了解与伴侣聊天机器人的关系如何影响社会健康，我们研究了定期使用伴侣聊天机器人和不使用它们的人。与期望相反，伴侣聊天机器人用户表示这些关系对他们的社会健康有益，而非用户则认为它们有害。",
