Thus, more flexible approaches are required to be able to accommodate such issues. To this end, we propose a Bayesian mixture of student-$t$ processes with an overall-local scale structure for the covariance. Moreover, we use a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler in order to perform online inference as data arrive in real-time. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to typical Gaussian process-based models on real-world data sets in order to prove the necessity of using mixtures of student-$t$ processes.",

    "translated_abstract": "时间相关的数据通常表现出非平稳性和重尾误差等特征，这些特征不适合采用常见模型所使用的假设进行建模。因此，需要更灵活的方法来处理这些问题。为此，我们提出了一种贝叶斯学生-t过程混合模型，其协方差具有整体-局部尺度结构。此外，我们使用顺序蒙特卡洛（SMC）采样器进行在线推断，以实时接收数据。通过在真实世界数据集上展示我们提出的方法相对于典型的基于高斯过程的模型的卓越性能，以证明使用学生-t过程混合模型的必要性。",
