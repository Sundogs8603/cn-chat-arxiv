    "translated_abstract": "外分布（OOD）检测对于改善机器学习模型的可靠性至关重要，它能够检测出不属于训练分布的样本。在某些任务中，有效地检测OOD样本可能会面临挑战，因为训练分布（ID）内部存在显著的异质性，并且ID和OOD类之间存在高度的结构相似性。例如，在胎儿超声视频中检测心脏视图时，心脏和腹部等其他解剖结构之间存在高度的结构相似性，并且每个视图内部存在着5种不同的视图和结构变化。为了检测此背景下的OOD样本，所得模型应能够学习到解剖结构内部的变化，并且能够拒绝类似的OOD样本。在本文中，我们介绍了双重条件扩散模型（DCDM），其中我们使用ID类信息和输入图像的潜在特征来对模型进行条件化重构。",
