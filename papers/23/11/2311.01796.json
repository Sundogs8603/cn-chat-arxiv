    "translated_abstract": "开放世界分类系统应该区分那些标签与内部分布情况不一致的未知样本，这促使了对未知样本检测的研究。尽管先进的方法在这方面取得了很大进展，但由于对未知样本缺乏预先了解，它们在开放世界中仍可能失败。虽然可以访问用于模型训练的辅助未知样本（与未知样本不同），但仍需分析这些辅助数据在开放世界中的效果。为此，我们从学习理论的角度研究这个问题，发现辅助未知样本和真实未知样本之间的分布差异是影响开放世界检测性能的关键。基于此，我们提出分布增强的未知样本学习(DAL)，通过构建一个包含在辅助未知样本分布周围的Wasserstein球中的所有分布的未知样本分布集来减小未知样本分布差异。我们证明了DAL在开放世界中具有较好性能。",

Specifically, it crafts an out-of-distribution set containing all distributions in a Wasserstein ball centered on the auxiliary out-of-distribution, effectively reducing distribution discrepancy and improving open-world detection performance."
