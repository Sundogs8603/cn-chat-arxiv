    "translated_abstract": "随着全球预期寿命的提高和人口老龄化，痴呆的患病率逐渐增加。个体发展痴呆的风险受到各种遗传、生活方式和环境因素等的影响。预测痴呆风险可以使个体采取缓解策略或改变生活方式来延缓痴呆发作。当前对痴呆预测的计算方法只返回狭窄类别的变量风险，并没有考虑不同风险变量之间的相互作用。所提出的框架采用一种新颖的全面痴呆风险预测方法，并首次将各种表格环境污染和生活方式因素数据与基于网络系统生物学的遗传数据相结合。采用LightGBM梯度提升方法确保所包含因素的有效性。该方法成功地通过一种被称为Sysable的原始加权整合方法建模了变量之间的相互作用。",
