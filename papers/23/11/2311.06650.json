    "translated_abstract": "最优传输旨在通过最小化成本（通常定义为距离函数）来学习源到目标的映射。该问题的解决方案由理想连接源和目标的直线段组成，没有分支结构。这些最优解与自然和人造运输网络形成鲜明对比，后者普遍存在分支结构。在这里，我们讨论了一种快速启发式分支方法，用于网络中的最优传输。我们还提供了对合成样例、简化心血管网络以及“圣诞老人”分配网络的多个数值应用，该分配网络包括全球141,182个已知位置和人口的城市。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种适用于分支网络的快速启发式最优传输方法，通过优化连接源和目标的直线段，解决了传统最优传输方法在分支结构存在时的不适用问题。",
