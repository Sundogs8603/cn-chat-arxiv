    "abstract": "Quantifying the difference between two probability density functions, $p$ and $q$, using available data, is a fundamental problem in Statistics and Machine Learning.

This paper contributes by introducing a new framework for online non-parametric LRE (OLRE) for the setting where pairs of iid observations $(x_t \\sim p, x'_t \\sim q)$ are observed over time. The non-parametric nature of our approach has the advantage of being agnostic to the forms of $p$ and $q$. Moreover, we capitalize on the recent advances in Kernel Methods and functional minimization to develop an estimator that can be efficiently updated online.

    "translated_abstract": "在统计学和机器学习中，使用可用数据量化两个概率密度函数p和q之间的差异是一个基本问题。解决这个问题的一种常见方法是似然比估计（LRE），我们的研究为在线非参数似然比估计（OLRE）引入了一个新的框架，适用于随时间观察到的i.i.d观测值（$x_t \\sim p, x'_t \\sim q$）。我们的方法的非参数性质具有对$p$和$q$的形式无知的优势。此外，我们利用核方法和函数最小化的最新进展，开发了一个可以进行高效在线更新的估计方法。我们提供了OLRE方法性能的理论保证，并在合成实验中进行了实证验证。",
