    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱补全旨在预测知识图谱中未见的边，从而发现新的事实。一类新的方法提出了通过聚合路径信息来解决这个问题。这些方法在知识图谱补全的任务中展示了巨大的能力。然而，它们饱受效率问题的困扰。虽然最近有一些尝试通过可学习的路径修剪来解决这个问题，但它们往往在性能上做出了牺牲以换取效率。在这项工作中，我们确定了这些方法的两个固有限制，这些限制影响了效率和表示质量。为了解决这些限制，我们引入了一种新方法，TAGNet，它能够有效地传播信息。这是通过仅在每对源-目标对中聚合固定窗口中的路径来实现的。我们证明了TAGNet的复杂度与层数无关。大量实验证明TAGNet可以减少传播消息的数量。",

TAGNet aggregates paths in a fixed window for each source-target pair, significantly reducing the number of propagated messages while maintaining performance.
