    "translated_abstract": "将语言模型与人类观点对齐对于增强它们把握人类价值观、喜好和信仰至关重要。我们提出了ChOiRe，一个四步框架，用于预测人类观点，该框架不同地对待用户明确声明的个人角色（即人口统计或意识形态属性）和从用户历史观点推断出的隐式个人角色。ChOiRe包括：（i）一个语言模型分析用户明确的个人角色，以过滤出不相关的属性；（ii）语言模型将隐式人物观点排名成优先列表；（iii）观点链推理（CoO），其中语言模型顺序地分析明确的个人角色和最相关的隐式个人角色以执行观点预测；（iv）以及ChOiRe执行第（iii）步CoO多次，随着隐式个人角色列表不断增加来克服个人角色信息不足以推断最终结果。ChOiRe取得了新的成果。",
