    "abstract": "The remarkable progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up new avenues for addressing planning and decision-making problems in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). However, as the number of agents increases, the issues of hallucination in LLMs and coordination in MAS have become increasingly prominent. Additionally, the efficient utilization of tokens emerges as a critical consideration when employing LLMs to facilitate the interactions among a substantial number of agents. In this paper, we develop a modular framework called LLaMAC to mitigate these challenges. LLaMAC implements a value distribution encoding similar to that found in the human brain, utilizing internal and external feedback mechanisms to facilitate collaboration and iterative reasoning among its modules. Through evaluations involving system resource allocation and robot grid transportation, we demonstrate the considerable advantages afforded by our proposed approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）的显著进展为解决多智能体系统中的规划和决策问题开辟了新的途径。然而，随着智能体数量的增加，LLM中的幻觉问题和多智能体系统的协调问题变得日益突出。此外，在利用LLM促进大量智能体之间的交互时，有效利用令牌成为一项重要考虑因素。在本文中，我们开发了一个名为LLaMAC的模块化框架来缓解这些挑战。LLaMAC实现了类似于人脑中的价值分布编码，利用内部和外部反馈机制促进其模块之间的协作和迭代推理。通过涉及系统资源分配和机器人网格运输的评估，我们展示了我们提出方法所带来的巨大优势。",
