Existing susceptibility studies heavily rely on self-reported beliefs, which can be subject to bias, expensive to collect, and challenging to scale for downstream applications. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a computational approach to model users' latent susceptibility levels. As shown in previous research, susceptibility is influenced by various factors (e.g., demographic factors, political ideology), and directly influences people's reposting behavior on social media. To represent the underlying mental process, our susceptibility modeling incorporates these factors as inputs, guided by the supervision of people's sharing behavior.

    "translated_abstract": "易受错误信息影响的程度描述了对不可验证主张的信仰程度，这是个体思维过程中的潜在因素，不可观察。现有易感性研究严重依赖于自我报告的信念，这可能存在偏见，收集成本高，并且难以在后续应用中扩展。为了解决这些限制，我们在这项研究中提出了一种计算方法来建模用户的潜在易感性水平。正如先前的研究所示，易感性受到各种因素的影响（例如人口统计因素、政治意识形态），并直接影响人们在社交媒体上的转发行为。为了表示基础心理过程，我们的易感性建模将这些因素作为输入，受到人们分享行为监督的引导。使用COVID-19作为实验领域，我们的实验证明了易感性评分之间存在显著的一致性。",
