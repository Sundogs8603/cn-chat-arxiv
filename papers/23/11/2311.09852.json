    "translated_abstract": "在智能城市中，支持充电技术的自主交互式无人机群可以提供引人注目的感知能力，例如交通监测和灾难响应。现有方法，包括分布式优化和深度强化学习(DRL)，旨在协调无人机以实现成本效益高、高质量的导航、感知和充电。然而，它们面临着重大挑战：短期优化在动态环境中的意外变化下并不有效，而长期学习缺乏可扩展性、韧性和灵活性。为了弥合这一差距，本文提出了一种新的渐进方法，将基于分布式优化的短期计划生成和选择与基于DRL的长期飞行方向的战略调度相结合。通过对从现实城市移动中生成的数据集进行广泛实验，表明所提出的解决方案与最先进的方法相比具有卓越的性能。",
