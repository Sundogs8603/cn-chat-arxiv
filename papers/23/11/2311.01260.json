Our approach utilizes a large language model (LLM) to transform expressive TTS into a style retrieval task.

    "translated_abstract": "表达性文本到语音（TTS）旨在合成具有人类般的语调、情绪甚至艺术属性的演讲。最近在表达性TTS方面的进展使用户能够通过自然语言提示直接控制合成风格。然而，这些方法通常需要大量带有标注样式的数据进行训练，这可能难以获取。此外，由于固定的样式标注，它们的适应能力可能有限。在这项工作中，我们提出了FreeStyleTTS（FS-TTS），一种具有最小人工标注的可控表达性TTS模型。我们的方法利用大型语言模型（LLM）将表达性TTS转变为样式检索任务。LLM根据外部样式提示从已注释的语句中选择最佳匹配的样式参考，这些样式提示可以是原始输入文本或自然语言样式描述。所选的参考指导TTS管道以合成具有预期样式的演讲。这种创新的方法引进了少量人工标注来驱动表达性TTS。",
