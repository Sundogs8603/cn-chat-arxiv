    "translated_abstract": "在过去十年中，从生产者到消费者的物品配送经历了显著的增长，并且最近的流行病进一步推动了这一增长。亚马逊生鲜、Shopify、UberEats、InstaCart和DoorDash正在迅速发展，并共享相同的消费品或食品配送业务模式。现有的食品配送方法存在缺陷，因为每次配送都是在最短时间路径上从生产者直接到消费者进行优化。我们观察到，在当前模型下，有很大的减少配送成本的空间。我们将我们的食品配送问题建模为一个多目标优化问题，消费者满意度和配送成本都需要进行优化。受出租车行业中拼车成功的启发，我们提出了DeliverAI - 一种基于强化学习的路径共享算法。与以前的路径共享尝试不同，DeliverAI可以提供实时、时间高效的决策。",
