    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的反应预测器经历了显著的架构演变。然而，它们对美国专利局反应的依赖导致了不可解释的预测和对其他化学领域（如自由基和大气化学）的有限泛化能力。为了应对这些挑战，我们引入了一种新的反应预测器系统RMechRP，它结合了最可解释的化学反应表示之一的机理路径和对比学习。RMechRP专为自由基反应而设计，提供了不同层次的化学反应解释。我们使用RMechDB，一个公共的自由基反应数据库，开发和训练了多个深度学习模型，建立了预测自由基反应的首个基准。我们的结果表明，RMechRP在提供准确和可解释的自由基反应预测方面的有效性，并且在各种应用中具有潜力。",
