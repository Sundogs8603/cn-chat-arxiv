It provides the first proof that when the operator $q$ is linear and symmetric the windowed AA, which uses a sliding window of prior iterates, improves the root-linear convergence factor over the fixed-point iterations. When $q$ is nonlinear, yet has a symmetric Jacobian at a fixed point, a slightly modified AA algorithm is proved to have an analogous root-linear convergence factor improvement over fixed-point iterations. Simulations verify our observations. Furthermore, experiments with different data models demonstrate AA is significantly superior to the standard fixed-point methods for Tyler's M-estimation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了常用的窗口式安德森加速（AA）算法用于不动点方法，$x^{(k+1)}=q(x^{(k)})$。它首次证明了当算子$q$是线性且对称时，使用先前迭代的滑动窗口的窗口式AA算法能够改进根线性收敛因子，超过不动点迭代。当$q$是非线性的，但在固定点处具有对称雅可比矩阵时，经过略微修改的AA算法被证明对比不动点迭代具有类似的根线性收敛因子改进。模拟验证了我们的观察。此外，使用不同数据模型进行的实验表明，在Tyler的M估计中，AA明显优于标准的不动点方法。",
