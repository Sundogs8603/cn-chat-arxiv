    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文的背景是利用人工智能和大数据从异构的已发表资源中创建大规模统一的考古数据集，比如遗物目录。论文关注的是一致考古数据组合的挑战。由于现有记录在质量和记录标准上存在差异，我们无法简单地合并现有记录。因此，必须从已发表的考古插图中重新创建记录。只有通过自动化的帮助，这才是可行的途径。本文的贡献是一个新的工作流程，用于从考古遗物目录中收集数据，这些目录作为遗留资源存在，比如大型未排序的PDF文件中的考古绘图和照片；该工作流程依赖于支持图像处理、物体检测以及验证和调整自动获取数据的交互手段的自定义软件（AutArch）。我们集成了人工智能技术。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文介绍了AutArch，一种用于考古目录中物体检测和自动化记录的人工智能辅助工作流程，并提出了一种新的数据收集方法，通过自动化从遗留资源中提取数据，解决了现有记录质量和标准不一致的挑战。"
