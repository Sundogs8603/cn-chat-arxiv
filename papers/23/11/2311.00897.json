    "translated_abstract": "文本到音频生成（TTA）通过学习音频样本和手工注释的文本对来从文本描述中生成音频。然而，商业化音频生成面临挑战，因为用户输入的提示通常与训练TTA模型所使用的文本描述相比缺乏具体性。在这项工作中，我们将TTA模型视为一个“黑盒子”，解决了用户提示挑战的两个关键洞察：（1）用户提示通常缺乏具体性，导致用户提示与训练提示之间存在较大的对齐差距。（2）存在一种音频描述分布，TTA模型能够生成更高质量音频，我们称之为“audionese”。为此，我们使用指导调整模型重写提示，并提出利用文本-音频对齐作为反馈信号，通过边界排序学习来改善音频质量。在客观和主观的人类评估中，我们观察到了文本-音频对齐和音乐音频质量的显著改善。",
