H-NeXt is a parameter-efficient roto-translation invariant network that is trained without a single augmented image in the training set. Our network comprises three components: an equivariant backbone for learning roto-translation independent features, an invariant pooling layer for discarding roto-translation information, and a classification layer. H-NeXt outperforms the state of the art in classification on unaugmented training sets and augmented test sets of MNIST and CIFAR-10.",
