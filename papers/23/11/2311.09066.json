Medical practitioners require robust and timely tools that can effectively identify at-risk patients. Community-based social media platforms such as Reddit allow self-disclosure for users to discuss otherwise sensitive drug-related behaviors. We present a moderate size corpus of 2500 opioid-related posts from various subreddits labeled with six different phases of opioid use: Medical Use, Misuse, Addiction, Recovery, Relapse, Not Using. For every post, we annotate span-level extractive explanations and crucially study their role both in annotation quality and model development. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models in a supervised, few-shot, or zero-shot setting. Experimental results and error analysis show that identifying the phases of ",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，美国有50万多人死于涉及处方药和非法阿片类药物的过量使用，造成了国家公共卫生紧急情况。 医疗从业者需要强大且及时的工具，能够有效识别处于风险之中的患者。社区型社交媒体平台（如Reddit）允许用户自行披露，讨论一般情况下敏感的与药物相关的行为。我们提出了一个中等规模的数据集，包含来自不同子社区的2500个与阿片类药物相关的帖子，标记有六种不同的阿片类药物使用阶段：医疗使用、滥用、成瘾、康复、复发、不使用。对于每个帖子，我们注释了基于片段级的摘要解释，并在注释质量和模型开发中重点研究它们的作用。我们在监督、少样本或零样本设置下评估了几种最先进的模型。实验结果和错误分析显示了识别各个阶段的重要性。",
