We answer this question by investigating LMs' more subtle judgments associated with \"language illusions\" -- sentences that are vague in meaning, implausible, or ungrammatical but receive unexpectedly high acceptability judgments by humans. We looked at three illusions: the comparative illusion (e.g. \"More people have been to Russia than I have\"), the depth-charge illusion (e.g. \"No head injury is too trivial to be ignored\"), and the negative polarity item (NPI) illusion (e.g. \"The hunter who no villager believed to be trustworthy will ever shoot a bear\"). We found that probabilities represented by LMs were more likely to align with human judgments of being \"tricked\" by the NPI illusion which examines a structural dep",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然语言模型（LMs）在判断语法性方面与人类有很大重叠，但是当人类在语言处理中系统性地出现错误时，我们是否期望LMs能像语言的认知模型那样模仿人类行为？通过研究与“语言幻觉”相关的LMs的更微妙判断，我们回答了这个问题——这些句子在意义上模糊、不合情理或语法错误，但却受到人类意外高接受度的判断。我们研究了三种幻觉：比较幻觉（例如“去过俄罗斯的人比我多”），深度冲击幻觉（例如“没有轻微的头部伤害可以被忽视”）和否定极性项（NPI）幻觉（例如“没有一个乡村人相信是可信赖的猎人会向熊射击”）。我们发现，LMs表示的概率更有可能与人类对于被NPI幻觉“欺骗”的判断一致，这一幻觉检验了一种结构依赖性。",
