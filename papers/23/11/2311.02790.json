    "translated_abstract": "对于科学界来说，评估一篇论文的重要性至关重要但也具有挑战性。尽管引用次数是最常用的评估指标，但它们被广泛批评为无法准确反映一篇论文的真正影响力。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种因果推断方法，称为TextMatch，它将传统的匹配框架适应于高维文本嵌入。具体而言，我们使用大型语言模型（LLM）对每篇论文进行文本嵌入，通过余弦相似性提取相似样本，并根据相似度值的加权平均合成一个反事实样本。我们将得到的指标称为CausalCite，作为论文引用的因果公式化。我们展示了它在各种标准上的有效性，如与科学专家对1K篇论文的报告的论文影响力的高相关性，过去论文的（经过时间考验的）奖项，以及在各个子领域的稳定性。",
