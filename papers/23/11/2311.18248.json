    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）强大的文本生成能力催生了许多辅助论文阅读甚至写作的工具。然而，LLMs或多模态LLMs的弱图表分析能力极大限制了它们的应用场景，尤其是对于科学学术论文写作。在这项工作中，为了实现更多功能的学术论文写作助手，我们主要关注增强多模态LLMs的图表分析能力。通过解析高质量论文的LaTeX源文件，我们精心构建了一个多模态图表理解数据集M-Paper。通过将论文中的图表与相关段落对齐，我们构建了用于训练和评估的专业图表分析样本。M-Paper是第一个支持综合理解多个科学图表的数据集，包括以图像或LaTeX代码格式提供的图形和表格。此外，为了更好地与用户的意图对齐，我们引入了\"概要\" 。",
