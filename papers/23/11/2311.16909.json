All of these commonly apply when analysing healthcare data. To address these analytical requirements, we propose a deep generative model for multinomial count data where both the weights and hidden units of the network are Dirichlet distributed. A Gibbs sampling procedure is formulated that takes advantage of a series of augmentation relations, analogous to the Zhou--Cong--Chen model. We apply the model on small handwritten digits, and a large experimental dataset of DNA mutations in cancer, and we show how the model is able to extract biologically meaningful meta-signatures in a fully data-driven way.",
