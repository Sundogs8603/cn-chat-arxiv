To this end, this paper proposes a value alignment benchmark named Flames, which encompasses both common harmlessness principles and a unique morality dimension that integrates specific Chinese values such as harmony. Accordingly, we carefully design adversarial prompts that incorporate complex scenarios and jailbreaking methods, mostly with implicit malice.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在各个地区的广泛应用强调了评估它们与人类价值观契合性的迫切性。然而，当前的基准测试未能有效地揭示LLMs中的安全漏洞。尽管许多模型在这些评估中得分很高，且“名列前茅”，但在LLMs与人类价值观的深层契合性和实现真正无害方面仍存在重大差距。为此，本文提出了一个名为\"火焰\"（Flames）的价值观契合性基准测试，该测试涵盖了常见的无害原则，以及一个整合了特定中国价值观如和谐的独特道德维度。因此，我们精心设计了包含复杂情境和大多带有隐含恶意的破解方法的对抗性提示。通过对17个主流LLMs进行提示，我们获得了模型的回应，并对其进行了详细评估。",
