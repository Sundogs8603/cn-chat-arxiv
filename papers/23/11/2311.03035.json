    "translated_abstract": "视觉Transformer模型（ViTs）在计算机视觉领域引起了革命，但在资源受限设备上部署仍然具有挑战性，因为计算需求较高。为了加快预训练的ViTs，研究人员开发了令牌修剪和令牌合并方法，旨在减少参与计算的令牌数量。然而，这些方法仍然有一些局限性，如修剪令牌导致的图像信息丢失和令牌匹配过程的低效性。本文介绍了一种新颖的基于图传播的令牌传播（GTP）方法，以解决高效ViTs中平衡模型效率和信息保留的挑战。受到图摘要算法的启发，GTP将不太重要的令牌信息细致地传播给空间和语义上相关的更重要的令牌。因此，剩下的少数令牌作为整个令牌图的摘要，使得该方法能够减少计算量。",
