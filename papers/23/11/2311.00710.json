    "translated_abstract": "AI对齐是确保AI产生期望结果而避免不良副作用的整体问题。虽然通常从安全和人类价值的角度考虑AI对齐，但也可以在设计和评估交互式AI系统的界面的背景下考虑AI对齐。本文将AI对齐的概念映射到基本的三步交互循环中，得出相应的对齐目标：1）规范对齐：确保用户能够高效可靠地将目标传达给AI；2）过程对齐：提供验证和可选择控制AI执行过程的能力；3）评估支持：确保用户能够验证和理解AI的输出。我们还介绍了代理过程的概念，它被定义为AI实际过程的简化、分离派生但可控制的表示；以及过程海湾的概念，它突显人类和AI过程之间的差异。",

It proposes three alignment objectives: specification alignment, process alignment, and evaluation support. It also introduces the concepts of surrogate process and Process Gulf to bridge the differences between human and AI processes."
