In this publication we address the problem of determining how important is each neighbor for the GNN when classifying a node and how to measure the performance for this specific task. To do this, various known explainability methods are reformulated to get the neighbor importance and four new metrics are presented. Our results show that there is almost no difference between the explanations provided by gradient-based techniques in the GNN domain. In addition, many explainability techniques failed to identify important neighbors when GNNs without self-loops are used.",

    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）中的可解释性是近年来新兴领域。在这篇文章中，我们解决了一个问题，即在对节点进行分类时，确定每个邻居对于 GNN 的重要性以及如何衡量这一特定任务的表现。为此，各种已知的可解释性方法被重新构造以获取邻居重要性，并提出了四种新的度量标准。我们的结果表明，在 GNN 领域，基于梯度的技术提供的解释几乎没有差异。此外，许多可解释性技术在使用没有自环的 GNNs 时未能识别重要的邻居。",
