    "abstract": "Video caching can significantly improve backhaul traffic congestion by locally storing the popular content that users frequently request. A privacy-preserving method is desirable to learn how users' demands change over time. As such, this paper proposes a novel resource-aware hierarchical federated learning (RawHFL) solution to predict users' future content requests under the realistic assumptions that content requests are sporadic and users' datasets can only be updated based on the requested content's information. Considering a partial client participation case, we first derive the upper bound of the global gradient norm that depends on the clients' local training rounds and the successful reception of their accumulated gradients over the wireless links. Under delay, energy and radio resource constraints, we then optimize client selection and their local rounds and central processing unit (CPU) frequencies to minimize a weighted utility function that facilitates RawHFL's convergence ",

    "translated_abstract": "视频缓存通过本地存储用户频繁请求的热门内容，可以显著改善回传流量拥塞问题。为了学习用户需求随时间的变化而保护隐私，本文提出了一种新颖的资源感知分层联邦学习(RawHFL)方法，用于预测用户未来的内容请求。考虑到部分客户端参与的情况，我们首先推导出全局梯度范数的上界，该范数取决于客户端的本地训练轮次和无线链路上累积梯度的成功接收。在延迟、能耗和无线资源约束条件下，我们优化客户端的选择、本地训练轮次和中央处理单元(CPU)频率，以最小化一个加权效用函数，从而促进RawHFL的收敛。",
