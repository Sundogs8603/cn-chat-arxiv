We study latent vulnerabilities exposed by this collaboration and consider adversarial attacks on a few agents with the goal of influencing the decisions of the rest. More specifically, we study adversarial attacks on CMA2B in both homogeneous settings, where agents operate with the same arm set, and heterogeneous settings, where agents have distinct arm sets. In the homogeneous setting, we propose attack strategies that, by targeting just one agent, convince all agents to select a particular target arm $T-o(T)$ times while incurring $o(T)$ attack costs in $T$ rounds. In the heterogeneous setting, we prove that a target arm attack requires linear attack costs and propose attack strategies that can force a maximum number of agents to suffer linear regrets while incurring sublinear costs and only manipulating the observations of a few target agent",

    "translated_abstract": "合作多智能体多臂赌徒问题（CMA2B）考虑了多个智能体在一个共享的多臂赌徒游戏中的协同努力。我们研究了这种协作所暴露出的潜在漏洞，并考虑对一部分智能体进行对抗攻击，目的是影响其他智能体的决策。具体而言，我们研究了对CMA2B的对抗攻击，包括同质设置（智能体具有相同的臂集）和异质设置（智能体具有不同的臂集）。在同质设置中，我们提出了攻击策略，通过只针对一个智能体，使得所有智能体在T轮中选择一个特定的目标臂T-o(T)次，同时承担o(T)的攻击成本。在异质设置中，我们证明了对目标臂的攻击需要线性的攻击成本，并提出了攻击策略，可以迫使最大数量的智能体承受线性的遗憾，同时承担亚线性的成本，并且只操纵了少数目标智能体的观察结果。",
