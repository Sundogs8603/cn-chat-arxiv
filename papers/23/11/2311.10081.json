Without incorporating extra feedback, they are still prone to generate unhelpful, hallucinated, or harmful responses. Second, while the visual instruction tuning data is generally structured in a multi-turn dialogue format, the connections and dependencies among consecutive conversational turns are weak. This reduces the capacity for effective multi-turn interactions. To tackle these, we propose a novel categorization of the NLF into two key types: critique and refinement.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了DRESS，一种大型视觉语言模型（LVLM），它创新性地利用来自大型语言模型的自然语言反馈（NLF），通过解决当前LVLM中存在的两个关键限制来增强其对齐和互动。首先，先前的LVLM通常仅依赖指导微调阶段来增强与人类偏好的对齐。如果不加入额外反馈，它们仍然容易生成无用、虚构或有害的响应。其次，虽然视觉指导调优数据通常以多轮对话格式结构化，但连续对话轮之间的连接和依赖关系较弱。这降低了有效多轮互动的能力。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了将NLF分为两种关键类型的新颖分类：批评和改进。批评性NLF识别响应的优点和缺点，并用于对齐",
