    "abstract": "Interest-free promotions are a prevalent strategy employed by credit card lenders to attract new customers, yet the research exploring their effects on both consumers and lenders remains relatively sparse. The process of selecting an optimal promotion strategy is intricate, involving the determination of an interest-free period duration and promotion-availability window, all within the context of competing offers, fluctuating market dynamics, and complex consumer behaviour. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based model that facilitates the exploration of various credit card promotions under diverse market scenarios. Our approach, distinct from previous agent-based models, concentrates on optimising promotion strategies and is calibrated using benchmarks from the UK credit card market from 2019 to 2020, with agent properties derived from historical distributions of the UK population from roughly the same period. We validate our model against stylised facts and time-series data, there",

    "translated_abstract": "无息促销是信用卡发行商吸引新客户的常用策略，然而对于它们对消费者和发行商的影响的研究相对较少。选择最优促销策略的过程是复杂的，涉及在竞争机制、市场动态和复杂的消费者行为背景下确定无息期限和促销可用窗口。在本文中，我们介绍了一种基于Agent的模型，可以在不同市场情景下探索各种信用卡促销策略。我们的方法与以往的基于Agent的模型不同，专注于优化促销策略，并使用2019年至2020年英国信用卡市场的基准数据进行校准，代理属性来自大致同一时期的英国人口的历史分布。我们通过结构化事实和时间序列数据对模型进行验证。",
