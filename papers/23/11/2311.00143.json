    "abstract": "In elections around the world, the candidates may turn their campaigns toward negativity due to the prospect of failure and time pressure. In the digital age, social media platforms such as Twitter are rich sources of political discourse. Therefore, despite the large amount of data that is published on Twitter, the automatic system for campaign negativity detection can play an essential role in understanding the strategy of candidates and parties in their campaigns. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model for detecting campaign negativity consisting of a two-stage classifier that combines the strengths of two machine learning models. Here, we have collected Persian tweets from 50 political users, including candidates and government officials. Then we annotated 5,100 of them that were published during the year before the 2021 presidential election in Iran. In the proposed model, first, the required datasets of two classifiers based on the cosine similarity of tweet embeddings with axis",

    "translated_abstract": "在全球各地的选举中，候选人可能会因失败前景和时间压力而将他们的竞选活动转向负面情绪。在数字时代，Twitter等社交媒体平台是政治话语的丰富来源。因此，尽管Twitter上发布了大量数据，但自动化的竞选负面情绪检测系统在理解候选人和政党在竞选活动中的策略方面起着至关重要的作用。在本文中，我们提出了一个混合模型，用于检测竞选活动的负面情绪，包括一个两阶段分类器，结合了两个机器学习模型的优势。在此，我们收集了来自50名政治用户（包括候选人和政府官员）的波斯语推文。然后，我们标注了其中5,100条推文，这些推文是在伊朗2021年总统选举前的一年内发布的。在提出的模型中，首先通过推文嵌入与轴的余弦相似性来建立两个分类器所需的数据集。",
