    "translated_abstract": "实际应用中的知识图谱经常存在不完整问题，限制了其潜在性能。知识图谱完善（KGC）技术旨在解决这个问题。然而，传统的KGC方法在大规模知识图谱上计算复杂度高，不实际，需要学习密集的节点嵌入和计算成对距离。生成式转换器语言模型（如T5和最近的KGT5）提供了一种有希望的解决方案，因为它们可以直接预测尾节点。在本研究中，我们提出了在语言模型基础上包含节点邻居作为额外信息来改进KGC方法。我们检验了这种补全的效果，并展示了在归纳和传递式Wikidata子集上，我们的方法优于KGT5和传统的KGC方法。我们还对邻居对模型预测的影响进行了广泛分析，并展示了其重要性。此外，我们指出了通过更高效的方法显著改善KGC的路径。",
