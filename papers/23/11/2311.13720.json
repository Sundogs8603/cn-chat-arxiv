We empirically demonstrate how the performance of an LLM contrasts with combinatorial search (CS) -- an approach that has been traditionally used to solve model space tasks in planning, both with the LLM in the role of a standalone model space reasoner as well as in the role of a statistical signal in concert with the CS approach as part of a two-stage process.

    "translated_abstract": "这是第一项研究将大型语言模型（LLMs）应用于自动规划任务中的模型空间编辑的工作。为此联盟铺平道路，我们探讨了AI规划文献中研究的两种不同味道的模型空间问题，并探讨了LLM对这些任务的影响。我们在实证中演示了LLM的性能如何与组合搜索（CS）形成对比 -- 传统上用于解决规划中模型空间任务的方法，LLM既扮演独立的模型空间推理者的角色，也与CS方法一起作为两阶段过程的一部分的统计信号的角色。我们的实验显示了有希望的结果，暗示LLMs在未来更深入地涉足规划任务中的模型空间推理这一激动人心的领域。",
