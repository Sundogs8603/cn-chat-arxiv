    "abstract": "Task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems have been mostly created for high-resource languages, such as English and Chinese. However, there is a need to develop ToD systems for other regional or local languages to broaden their ability to comprehend the dialogue contexts in various languages. This paper introduces IndoToD, an end-to-end multi domain ToD benchmark in Indonesian. We extend two English ToD datasets to Indonesian, comprising four different domains by delexicalization to efficiently reduce the size of annotations. To ensure a high-quality data collection, we hire native speakers to manually translate the dialogues. Along with the original English datasets, these new Indonesian datasets serve as an effective benchmark for evaluating Indonesian and English ToD systems as well as exploring the potential benefits of cross-lingual and bilingual transfer learning approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数任务导向对话系统只是为高资源语言如英语和汉语创建的，然而，有必要开发其他区域或本地语言的对话系统，以扩展它们理解不同语言对话背景的能力。本文介绍了IndoToD，一个印尼语端到端多领域对话系统基准。我们通过词法分析将两个英语对话数据集扩展到印尼语，包括四个不同领域，以高效地减少注释的大小。为了确保高质量的数据收集，我们雇用母语为印尼语的人手动翻译对话。除了原始的英语数据集外，这些新的印尼语数据集可以作为评估印尼语和英语对话系统以及探索跨语言和双语迁移学习方法潜在益处的有效基准。",
