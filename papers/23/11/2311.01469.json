    "abstract": "In recent years, climate change repercussions have increasingly captured public interest. Consequently, corporations are emphasizing their environmental efforts in sustainability reports to bolster their public image. Yet, the absence of stringent regulations in review of such reports allows potential greenwashing. In this study, we introduce a novel methodology to train a language model on generated labels for greenwashing risk. Our primary contributions encompass: developing a mathematical formulation to quantify greenwashing risk, a fine-tuned ClimateBERT model for this problem, and a comparative analysis of results. On a test set comprising of sustainability reports, our best model achieved an average accuracy score of 86.34% and F1 score of 0.67, demonstrating that our methods show a promising direction of exploration for this task.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，气候变化的后果越来越引起公众的关注。因此，企业在可持续发展报告中强调其环保努力以增强公众形象。然而，对此类报告的审核缺乏严格的监管，可能导致绿色虚假宣传。在本研究中，我们引入了一种新的方法来对绿色虚假宣传风险进行训练语言模型。我们的主要贡献包括：开发了一种数学形式来量化绿色虚假宣传风险，提出了一个针对该问题的优化ClimateBERT模型，并进行了结果的比较分析。在一个包含可持续发展报告的测试集上，我们的最佳模型实现了平均准确率86.34%和F1值0.67，表明我们的方法对于这一任务具有探索的良好方向。",
