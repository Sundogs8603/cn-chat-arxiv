    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19大流行突显了可靠、非侵入性诊断工具在强有力的公共卫生干预中的重要性。本研究将磁性呼吸感应技术（MRST）与机器学习（ML）相结合，创建了一种诊断平台，用于实时追踪和诊断COVID-19和其他呼吸系统疾病。MRST通过三种特定的呼吸测试方案（正常呼吸、屏气和深呼吸）精确捕捉呼吸模式。我们在越南使用这个平台采集了COVID-19患者和健康人士的呼吸数据，然后用这些数据对ML模型进行训练和验证。我们评估了多种ML算法，包括支持向量机和深度学习模型，评估它们诊断COVID-19的能力。我们的多模型验证方法确保了全面比较，并具备选择最优模型的适应性，在诊断精度和模型可解释性之间取得平衡。",
