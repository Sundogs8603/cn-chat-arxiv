Such out-of-context fake news may arise across different domains like politics, sports, entertainment, etc. In practical scenarios, an inherent problem of imbalance exists among news articles from such widely varying domains, resulting in a few domains with abundant data, while the rest containing very limited data. Under such circumstances, it is imperative to develop methods which can work in such varying amounts of data setting. In this work, we explore whether out-of-domain data can help to improve out-of-context misinformation detection (termed here as multi-modal fake news detection) of a desired domain, to address this challenging problem. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt-tuning using Out-of-Domain data). First, to compute generalizable featu",

    "translated_abstract": "虚假新闻利用脱离上下文的图像传播已经变得普遍，是信息过载时代一个相关的问题。这种脱离上下文的虚假新闻可能涉及不同领域，如政治、体育、娱乐等。在实际场景中，不同领域新闻文章存在着数据不平衡的问题，部分领域数据丰富，而其他领域数据非常有限。在这种情况下，必须开发出能够适应不同数据量设置的方法。本文探讨了跨领域数据是否有助于改善所需领域的脱离上下文误信息检测（在此称为多模态虚假新闻检测）的方法以解决这一具有挑战性的问题。为此，我们提出了一种名为DPOD（使用跨领域数据进行领域特定提示调节）的新框架。",
