    "translated_abstract": "对于工业级学习排序（LTR）系统来说，通常会对排序模型的输出进行修改，这可能是由于执行业务要求的后处理逻辑，也可能是由于实际生产系统中存在的设计缺陷或错误而导致的。这对于部署离线学习和评估方法构成了挑战，因为这些方法通常依赖于模型评分所暗示的排序与向用户显示的项目一致。可靠的离线评估还需要正确的随机化和正确估计在排名的任何给定位置上显示每个项目的倾向，而这些也受到上述后处理的影响。我们通过实证研究了这些情况如何影响学习排序模型的离线评估。然后，我们提出了一种基于Birkhoff-von-Neumann分解的新的校正方法，该方法对于这种类型的后处理是稳健的。",
