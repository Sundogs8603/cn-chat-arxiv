    "abstract": "This paper proposes two innovative methodologies to construct customized Common Voice datasets for low-resource languages like Hindi. The first methodology leverages Bark, a transformer-based text-to-audio model developed by Suno, and incorporates Meta's enCodec and a pre-trained HuBert model to enhance Bark's performance. The second methodology employs Retrieval-Based Voice Conversion (RVC) and uses the Ozen toolkit for data preparation. Both methodologies contribute to the advancement of ASR technology and offer valuable insights into addressing the challenges of constructing customized Common Voice datasets for under-resourced languages. Furthermore, they provide a pathway to achieving high-quality, personalized voice generation for a range of applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了两种创新的方法来构建定制化的Common Voice数据集，以应对低资源语言如印地语的挑战。第一种方法利用Suno开发的基于Transformer的文本到音频模型Bark，结合了Meta的enCodec和预训练的HuBert模型，以提高Bark的性能。第二种方法采用基于检索的语音转换(RVC)，并使用Ozen工具包进行数据准备。这两种方法都为ASR技术的发展做出了贡献，并为解决构建定制化Common Voice数据集的挑战提供了宝贵的见解。此外，它们还为实现各种应用的高质量个性化语音生成提供了途径。",
