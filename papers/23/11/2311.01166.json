    "abstract": "Since the release of ChatGPT, generative models have achieved tremendous success and become the de facto approach for various NLP tasks. However, its application in the field of input methods remains under-explored. Many neural network approaches have been applied to the construction of Chinese input method engines(IMEs).Previous research often assumed that the input pinyin was correct and focused on Pinyin-to-character(P2C) task, which significantly falls short of meeting users' demands. Moreover, previous research could not leverage user feedback to optimize the model and provide personalized results. In this study, we propose a novel Generative Input paradigm named GeneInput. It uses prompts to handle all input scenarios and other intelligent auxiliary input functions, optimizing the model with user feedback to deliver personalized results. The results demonstrate that we have achieved state-of-the-art performance for the first time in the Full-mode Key-sequence to Characters(FK2C) ",

    "translated_abstract": "自从ChatGPT发布以来，生成模型在各种自然语言处理任务中取得了巨大成功，并成为事实上的方法。然而，在输入法领域中，其应用仍然不够深入。许多神经网络方法已被应用于中文输入法引擎的构建。以往的研究常常假设输入的拼音是正确的，并关注拼音到字符的转换任务，这在满足用户需求方面显然不足够。此外，以前的研究无法利用用户反馈来优化模型并提供个性化的结果。在本研究中，我们提出了一种名为GeneInput的全新生成输入范式。它使用提示处理所有输入场景和其他智能辅助输入功能，通过用户反馈优化模型以提供个性化的结果。实验结果表明，我们首次在全模式按键序列到字符的任务上达到了最先进的性能。",
