    "abstract": "Neural text detectors are models trained to detect whether a given text was generated by a language model or written by a human. In this paper, we investigate three simple and resource-efficient strategies (parameter tweaking, prompt engineering, and character-level mutations) to alter texts generated by GPT-3.5 that are unsuspicious or unnoticeable for humans but cause misclassification by neural text detectors. The results show that especially parameter tweaking and character-level mutations are effective strategies.",

    "translated_abstract": "神经文本检测器是训练用于检测给定文本是由语言模型生成还是由人类编写的模型。本文研究了三种简单而资源高效的策略（参数调整，提示工程和字符级变异），用于修改由GPT-3.5生成的文本，这些修改对人类来说不可疑或不易察觉，但会导致神经文本检测器误分类。结果表明，特别是参数调整和字符级变异是有效的策略。",
