    "translated_abstract": "POI推荐在促进各种基于位置的社交网络服务方面具有实际重要性，并近年来引起了越来越多的研究关注。现有的作品通常假设用户报告的可用POI签到是用户行为的唯一描述。然而，在实际应用场景中，由于主观和客观原因（包括定位误差和用户隐私问题），签到数据可能相当不可靠，这对POI推荐的性能造成了显著的负面影响。为此，我们研究了一个新颖的问题，通过考虑用户签到的不确定因素，提出了一种贝叶斯增强的多视角注意力网络来进行强大的POI推荐。具体而言，我们构建了个人POI转换图、基于语义的POI图和基于距离的POI图，全面建模了POI之间的依赖关系。由于个人POI转换图通常稀疏且对噪声敏感，所以我们引入了贝叶斯方法来增强网络的鲁棒性和性能。",
