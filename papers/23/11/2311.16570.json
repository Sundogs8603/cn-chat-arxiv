    "abstract": "The clarion call for causal reduction in the study of capital markets is intensifying. However, in self-referencing and open systems such as capital markets, the idea of unidirectional causation (if applicable) may be limiting at best, and unstable or fallacious at worst. In this research, we critically assess the use of scientific deduction and causal inference within the study of empirical finance and econometrics. We then demonstrate the idea of competing causal chains using a toy model adapted from ecological predator/prey relationships. From this, we develop the alternative view that the study of empirical finance, and the risks contained therein, may be better appreciated once we admit that our current arsenal of quantitative finance tools may be limited to ex post causal inference under popular assumptions. Where these assumptions are challenged, for example in a recognizable reflexive context, the prescription of unidirectional causation proves deeply problematic.",

    "translated_abstract": "在资本市场等自我参照和开放系统中，对于因果降解在研究中的呼声日益高涨。然而，在这样的系统中，单向因果关系的概念在最好的情况下可能是有限制的，在最坏的情况下可能是不稳定或荒谬的。本研究中，我们批判性地评估了在实证金融和计量经济学研究中使用科学演绎和因果推断的做法。然后，我们使用从生态食饵关系中改编的玩具模型来展示竞争性因果链的观点。基于此，我们提出了另一种观点，即当我们承认我们当前的量化金融工具可能在流行假设下仅限于事后因果推断时，我们可能更好地理解实证金融研究及其中所包含的风险。当这些假设受到挑战时，例如在可识别的反身性背景下，单向因果关系的建议就显得非常棘手。",
