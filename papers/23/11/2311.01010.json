    "translated_abstract": "Shapley值已经成为一种被广泛接受和可靠的工具，它以理论公理为基础，用于解决深度神经网络等黑盒模型所带来的挑战。然而，在特征数目上，计算Shapley值会遇到指数级复杂性。已经探索了各种方法，包括ApproSemivalue、KernelSHAP和FastSHAP，以加速计算。我们分析了现有工作的一致性，并得出结论，即随机估计器可以统一为特征子集重要性抽样的线性变换。基于此，我们研究了设计简单摊销估计器的可能性，并提出了一种直接和高效的方法，即SimSHAP，通过消除冗余技术。在表格和图像数据集上进行的大量实验验证了我们的SimSHAP的有效性，它显着加速了准确Shapley值的计算。",
