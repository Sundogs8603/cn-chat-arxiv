    "abstract": "We construct the maximally predictable portfolio (MPP) of stocks using machine learning. Solving for the optimal constrained weights in the multi-asset MPP gives portfolios with a high monthly coefficient of determination, given the sample covariance matrix of predicted return errors from a machine learning model. Various models for the covariance matrix are tested. The MPPs of S&P 500 index constituents with estimated returns from Elastic Net, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression models can outperform or underperform the index depending on the time period. Portfolios that take advantage of the high predictability of the MPP's returns and employ a Kelly criterion style strategy consistently outperform the benchmark.",
