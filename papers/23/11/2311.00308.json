    "translated_abstract": "视觉问答(VQA)是一个综合计算机视觉(CV)和自然语言处理(NLP)的多模态任务，旨在对任何视觉输入生成答案。VQA的范围已从关注自然图像的数据集扩展到包含合成图像、视频、3D环境和其他视觉输入的数据集。大型预训练网络的出现使早期依赖特征提取和融合方案的VQA方法转向了视觉语言预训练(VLP)技术。然而，目前缺乏包括传统VQA架构和现代基于VLP的方法在内的综合调查。此外，还没有对VQA视角下的VLP挑战进行深入探讨，留下了可能出现潜在开放问题的空间。本研究在VQA领域提供了一份调查报告，深入探讨了VQA数据集和历史中的方法细节。",
