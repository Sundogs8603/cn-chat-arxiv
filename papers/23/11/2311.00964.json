    "translated_abstract": "规则在金融科技机构中被广泛用于进行欺诈预防决策，因为规则具有直观的 if-then 结构，易于理解。在实践中，大型金融科技机构通常采用两阶段欺诈预防决策规则集挖掘框架。本文关注于从初始规则集中找到高质量的规则子集，以双目标空间（如精确率和召回率）为基础。为此，我们采用 Pareto 最优性概念，旨在找到一组非支配的规则子集，构成一个 Pareto 前沿。我们提出了一个基于启发式的框架 PORS，并确定了 PORS 的核心问题是前沿解决方案选择（SSF）问题。我们对 SSF 问题进行了系统分类，并在公开和专有数据集上进行了全面的实证评估。我们还引入了一种名为 SpectralRules 的新颖变体的顺序覆盖算法，以鼓励规则的多样性。",
