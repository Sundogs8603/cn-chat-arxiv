    "translated_abstract": "最近，仅基于数据分布而不考虑数据噪声选取机器学习模型。本研究旨在区分哪些模型在噪声数据下表现良好，并确定堆叠机器学习模型是否确实为原本对噪声敏感的模型提供了鲁棒性。使用12个独立模型和堆叠模型对电化学数据进行测试，包括XGB、LGBM、RF、GB、ADA、NN、ELAS、LASS、RIDGE、SVM、KNN、DT和堆叠模型。发现线性模型能够很好地处理噪声，平均误差为1.75 F g-1，在添加100%噪声时误差最小，平均为60.19 F g-1。而基于树的模型在噪声处理方面失败（100%噪声时平均斜率为55.24 F g-1），但它可以提供更高的预测准确性（最低误差为23.9 F g-1）。",
