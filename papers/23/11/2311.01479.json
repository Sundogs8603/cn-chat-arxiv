    "translated_abstract": "群外（OOD）检测对于安全部署人工智能至关重要。特别是，OOD检测器应该在各种场景中有效地泛化。为了改进现有OOD检测器的泛化能力，我们引入了一种高度灵活的OOD检测器，称为神经坍塌（NC-OOD）检测器。我们扩展了普遍观察到的群内（ID）特征倾向于形成簇，而群外特征则远离的观察。特别是基于最近的观察结果，神经坍塌，我们进一步证明ID特征倾向于在接近权重向量的位置聚集。根据我们的扩展观察，我们提出了一种基于特征与权重向量的接近程度来检测OOD的方法。为了进一步排除OOD样本，我们利用了OOD特征倾向于比ID特征更接近原点的观察结果。大量实验证明我们的方法增强了现有工作的泛化能力，并且在OOD检测方面始终能够达到最先进的水平。",
