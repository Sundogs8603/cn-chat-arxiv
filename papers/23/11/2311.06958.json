These models provide several benefits over other types of generative models due to their training stability, invertibility and efficiency in sampling and inference. This makes them a suitable candidate for stochastic spatio-temporal prediction problems, which are omnipresent in many fields of sciences, such as earth sciences, astrophysics or molecular sciences. In this paper, we present conditional normalizing flows for stochastic spatio-temporal modelling. The method is evaluated on the task of daily temperature and hourly geopotential map prediction from ERA5 datasets. Experiments show that our method is able to capture spatio-temporal correlations and extrapolates well beyond the time horizon used during training.",

    "translated_abstract": "生成式归一化流能够建模多模态空间分布，已经成功地模拟了时间相关性。由于其训练稳定性、可逆性以及在采样和推断方面的高效性，这些模型比其他类型的生成模型提供了几项好处。这使它们成为随机空间-时间预测问题的合适候选者，在许多科学领域中都普遍存在，如地球科学、天体物理学或分子科学。本文介绍了用于随机空间-时间建模的条件化归一化流。该方法在从ERA5数据集进行的日温度和小时等压图预测任务上进行了评估。实验表明，我们的方法能够捕捉空间-时间相关性，并能够在训练期间使用的时间范围之外进行良好的外推。",
