    "translated_abstract": "从彩色图像中推断出地形的物理性质可以帮助制定高效的机器人运动计划。然而，与图像分类不同，人类难以直观地将图像块标记为物理性质。在没有标记数据的情况下，构建一个以观测到的地形为输入并预测物理性质的视觉系统仍然具有挑战性。我们提出了一种通过机器人在实际环境中遍历期间捕获的图像进行自我监督标记的方法，并使用在模拟中训练的物理性质估计器来训练它。为了确保准确标记，我们引入了主动感知运动策略（ASMP），该策略被训练为探索增加物理参数估计准确度的运动行为。例如，四足机器人学会刷脚与地面接触以准确估计摩擦系数。我们展示了使用少量实际环境遍历数据训练的视觉系统能够准确预测。",
