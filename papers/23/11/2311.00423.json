    "translated_abstract": "数据稀疏性一直是推荐系统中的一个挑战，之前的研究尝试通过引入附加信息来解决这个问题。然而，这种方法往往会带来噪声、可用性问题和数据质量低下等副作用，从而影响对用户偏好的准确建模，进而对推荐性能产生不利影响。鉴于大型语言模型（LLM）在知识库和推理能力方面的最新进展，我们提出了一个名为LLMRec的新框架，它通过采用三种简单而有效的基于LLM的图增强策略来增强推荐系统。我们的方法利用在线平台（如Netflix，MovieLens）中丰富的内容，在三个方面增强交互图：（i）加强用户-物品交互边，（ii）增强对物品节点属性的理解，（iii）进行用户节点建模，直观地表示用户特征。",
