Here, we present a novel approach to achieve controllable generation of specific viewpoints using LLMs, that can be leveraged to produce multiple perspectives and to reflect the diverse opinions. Moving beyond the traditional reliance on demographics like age, gender, or party affiliation, we introduce a data-driven notion of persona grounded in collaborative filtering, which is defined as either a single individual or a cohort of individuals manifesting similar views across specific inquiries. As individuals in the same demographic group may have different personas, our data-driven persona definition allows for a more nuanced understanding of different (latent) social groups present in the population.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)已知会生成具有偏见的回应，某些群体和人口的意见被忽视。本文提出了一种新方法，通过LLMs实现特定观点的可控生成，可以用来产生多角度观点并反映多样化意见。我们超越了传统对于年龄、性别或政党归属等人口统计数据的依赖，引入了基于协同过滤的数据驱动人物的概念，将其定义为在特定研究中展现出相似观点的单个个体或人群。由于处在相同人口统计群体中的个体可能具有不同的人物，我们的数据驱动人物定义允许更细致地理解人口中存在的不同(潜在)社会群体。此外，我们还探讨了一种有效的方法来引导LLMs朝向这些人物。",
