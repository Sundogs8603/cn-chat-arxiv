    "translated_abstract": "当应用于自然图像分割时，Segment Anything Model (SAM)已经展现出了令人印象深刻的性能。然而，它在地理图像（如航拍和卫星图像）中面临困难，特别是在分割道路、人行道和人行横道等移动基础设施时。这种较差的性能源于这些对象的窄小特征，它们的纹理融入环境中，以及树木、建筑物、车辆和行人等物体的干扰，这些都可能使模型失去定向产生不准确的分割图。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了地理SAM（GeoSAM），这是一个基于SAM的新框架，它使用来自零样本学习的密集视觉提示和预训练CNN分割模型的稀疏视觉提示实施了细调策略。所提出的GeoSAM在地理图像分割方面优于现有方法，特别是对于道路基础设施、行人基础设施的分割性能提升了26％、7％和17％。",
