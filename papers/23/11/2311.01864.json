    "translated_abstract": "关于相关性排名的问题，即根据给定的标准对一组对象进行排序。由于用户可能偏好不同的相关性标准，因此排序算法应该能够根据用户需求进行调整。学习排序的任务在文献中存在两种主要方法：1）通过示例学习的得分函数，评估每个对象的属性，生成可用于对对象进行排序的绝对相关性值；2）一种成对方法，通过使用对象对来学习“偏好函数”，定义哪一个对象应该首先排名。在本文中，我们提出了SortNet，一种使用神经网络作为比较器来对对象进行自适应排序的算法。神经网络的训练集提供了对于成对项目之间所需排序的示例，并且通过迭代过程构建，每次迭代都会添加最具信息性的训练示例。此外，比较器采用了连接主义体系结构。",
