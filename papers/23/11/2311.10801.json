However, existing work mostly focuses on fixed stock pools, which is inconsistent with investors' practical demand. Specifically, the target stock pool of different investors varies dramatically due to their discrepancy on market states and individual investors may temporally adjust stocks they desire to trade (e.g., adding one popular stocks), which lead to customizable stock pools (CSPs). Existing RL methods require to retrain RL agents even with a tiny change of the stock pool, which leads to high computational cost and unstable performance.

    "translated_abstract": "投资组合管理（PM）是一项基本的金融交易任务，探索定期将资金重新配置到不同股票中以追求长期利润。最近，强化学习（RL）显示出其潜力，通过与金融市场互动来训练具有盈利能力的PM代理。但是，现有工作主要集中在固定股票池上，这与投资者的实际需求不一致。为应对这一挑战，我们提出EarnMore，一种新的RL方法，可以允许RL代理与可定制股票池（CSPs）交互，而不需要重新训练。",
