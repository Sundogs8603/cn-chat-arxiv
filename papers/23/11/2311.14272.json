    "translated_abstract": "用于分类任务的机器学习流程通常会训练一个通用模型，以实现在各种类别上的准确性。然而，典型用户只会定期遇到有限的类别选择。这种不平衡提供了一个机会，通过定制模型重点关注用户特定类别来增强计算效率。现有作品依赖于不结构化的剪枝，这在模型中引入了随机分布的非零值，使其不适用于硬件加速。另外，一些方法使用结构化剪枝，如通道剪枝，但这些方法往往只提供最小的压缩，并可能导致模型准确性降低。在这项工作中，我们提出了CRISP，一种新颖的剪枝框架，利用了混合结构稀疏性模式，结合精细的N:M结构稀疏性和粗粒度的块稀疏性。我们的剪枝策略是基于梯度的基于类别的",
