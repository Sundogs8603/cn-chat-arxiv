    "translated_abstract": "自动生成放射学报告在临床价值上至关重要，因为它可以减轻放射科医生的工作负担，并提醒经验较少的医生潜在的异常情况。尽管各种图像字幕方法在自然图像领域表现出色，但为医学图像生成准确的报告仍面临挑战，如视觉和文本数据的差异以及缺乏准确的领域知识。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种增强的知识注入框架，该框架利用两个分支提取不同类型的知识。加权概念知识（Weighted Concept Knowledge，WCK）分支负责使用TF-IDF分数对临床医学概念进行加权引入。多模式检索知识（Multimodal Retrieval Knowledge，MRK）分支从相似报告中提取三元组，强调与实体位置和存在相关的关键临床信息。通过将这种更精细和良好结构化的知识与当前图像集成，我们能够利用",
