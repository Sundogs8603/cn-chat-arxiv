    "translated_abstract": "目前，贝叶斯方法在解决逆问题方面已经成为常规实践。在逆问题中，关注的参数或信号只能以给定地图的图像方式间接观察到，并且观测通常受到噪声的影响。贝叶斯提供了通过先验分布对这些问题进行正则化的自然方法，并提供了概率解，量化问题中剩余的不确定性。然而，标准的基于样本的贝叶斯方法在这种复杂模型中的计算成本可能会过高。因此，变分贝叶斯在实践中越来越受欢迎。然而，对这些方法的理论理解仍然相对有限，特别是在逆问题的背景下。在我们的分析中，我们研究了用于解决线性逆问题的变分贝叶斯方法和高斯过程先验。我们考虑了轻度和严重病态逆问题，并与流行的引发变量方法合作。",
