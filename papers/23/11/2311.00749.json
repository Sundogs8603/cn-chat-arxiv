    "translated_abstract": "我们通过学习增强的算法视角探索了排序的基本问题，其中算法可以利用可能存在错误的预测来提高效率。我们考虑了两种不同的情景：在第一种情景中，每个项目都被提供了一个其在排序列表中位置的预测。在第二种情景中，我们假设存在一种“快速且粗糙”的比较方式，除此之外还存在慢而准确的比较方式。对于这两种情景，我们设计了新的简单算法，仅利用$O(\\sum_i \\log \\eta_i)$个准确比较，其中$\\eta_i$是第$i$个元素的适当定义的预测误差。特别地，随着预测的质量恶化，比较的数量从$O(n)$平滑地下降到$O(n\\log n)$。我们证明了比较复杂性在所考察的误差度量方面在理论上是最优的。与现有的自适应和非自适应排序算法进行的实验评估表明了应用预测的潜力。",
