    "translated_abstract": "预训练和微调已成为各种自然语言处理任务中的一种有前途的范式。预训练的大型语言模型（LLM）的有效性得到了进一步提升，并具有在医学领域，特别是传统中医领域应用的潜力。然而，将这些通用模型应用于特定领域往往产生次优结果，主要是由于缺乏领域知识、独特目标和计算效率等挑战。此外，它们在专业领域（如传统中医）的有效性需要进行全面评估。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了一种新颖的领域特定的TCMDA（传统中医领域适应）方法，即利用领域特定语料库进行高效预训练。具体而言，我们首先通过识别领域关键词并从通用语料库中检索，构建了一个大型的传统中医特定语料库TCM-Corpus-1B。然后，我们的TCMDA方法使用这个语料库进行预训练。通过实验验证了我们方法的有效性。",
