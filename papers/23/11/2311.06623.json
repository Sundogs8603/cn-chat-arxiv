    "abstract": "Enhancing roadway safety and traffic management has become an essential focus area for a broad range of modern cyber-physical systems and intelligent transportation systems. Vehicle Trajectory Prediction is a pivotal element within numerous applications for highway and road safety. These applications encompass a wide range of use cases, spanning from traffic management and accident prevention to enhancing work-zone safety and optimizing energy conservation. The ability to implement intelligent management in this context has been greatly advanced by the developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), alongside the increasing deployment of surveillance cameras across road networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel transformer-based approach for vehicle trajectory prediction for highway safety and surveillance, denoted as VT-Former.
