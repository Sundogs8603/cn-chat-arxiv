Since GNNs embody complex data dependencies between training samples, the training of GNNs should address distinct challenges different from DNN training in data management, such as data partitioning, batch preparation for mini-batch training, and data transferring between CPUs and GPUs. These factors, which take up a large proportion of training time, make data management in GNN training more significant. This paper reviews GNN training from a data management perspective and provides a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the representative approaches. We conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and show many interesting and valuable results. We also provide some practical tips learned from these experiments, which are helpful for designing GNN training systems in the future.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近出现了许多支持高效GNN训练的图神经网络（GNN）训练系统。由于GNN体现了训练样本之间的复杂数据依赖关系，在数据管理方面，GNN的训练应该解决不同于DNN训练的数据划分、小批量训练批次准备和CPU与GPU之间的数据传输等独特挑战。这些因素占据了训练时间的很大比例，使得GNN训练中的数据管理变得更加重要。本文从数据管理的角度审视GNN训练，并对代表性方法进行全面分析和评估。我们在各种基准数据集上进行了大量实验，并展示了许多有趣和有价值的结果。我们还提供了从这些实验中学到的一些建议，这些对未来设计GNN训练系统很有帮助。",
