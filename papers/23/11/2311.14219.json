    "translated_abstract": "金融危机和传染病危机等未知事件的经验揭示了在固定的概率测度下测量风险的局限性。为了解决这个问题，在金融界长期以来一直认识到所谓的不确定性的重要性，它允许概率测度本身发生变化。另一方面，在经济学领域对主观概率测度进行了许多研究。但即使在这些情况下，研究也是基于两个层次的不确定性：在已知传统概率测度（概率分布）的情况下的风险，以及由于主观概率测度可以在某个空间中任意取值所带来的不确定性。在这项研究中，我们通过引入一个称为不确定性空间（uncertainty spaces）的新概念来表达所谓的n层不确定性，这是概率空间的扩展概念，并使用不确定性空间序列（U-sequence）来进行研究。",
    "tldr": "本论文介绍了一种称为不确定性空间的新概念，用于表达不同层级的不确定性。通过引入不确定性空间序列，可以对金融和经济领域的不确定性进行更准确和细致的建模。",
