    "translated_abstract": "随着检测器的快速发展，边界框回归（BBR）损失函数不断更新和优化。然而，现有的基于IoU的BBR仍然着重于通过添加新的损失项来加速收敛，忽视了IoU损失项本身的局限性。尽管从理论上讲，IoU损失可以有效描述边界框回归的状态，但在实际应用中，它不能根据不同的检测器和检测任务自我调整，并且没有很强的泛化性。基于上述问题，我们首先分析了BBR模型，并得出结论：区分不同的回归样本，并利用不同尺度的辅助边界框计算损失，可以有效加速边界框回归过程。对于高IoU的样本，使用较小的辅助边界框计算损失可以加速收敛，而对于低IoU的样本，则适合使用较大的辅助边界框。然后，我们提出了Inner-IoU损失，它计算...",
