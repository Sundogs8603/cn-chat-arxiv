One particular area of interest is acquiring recordings from the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum in order to understand brain injuries and the loss of motor functions.

In this work, we propose a lightweight neuronal-spike detection and classification architecture that leverages on the unique characteristics of the Purkinje cells to discard unneeded information from the sparse neural data in real time.
