    "translated_abstract": "标准的深度学习算法需要对大规模非线性网络进行微分，这个过程缓慢且耗能。电子学习变质材料提供了潜在的快速、高效和容错的模拟机器学习硬件，但现有实现是线性的，严重限制了其功能。这些系统与人工神经网络和人脑有很大的区别，因此尚未探索将非线性元素纳入其中的可行性和实用性。在这里，我们介绍了一种非线性学习变质材料——一种基于晶体管的自适应非线性阻性元件的模拟电子网络。我们证明该系统可以在没有计算机的情况下学习不可实现的任务，包括异或和非线性回归。我们发现我们的非线性学习变质材料按顺序降低训练误差的模式（均值、斜率、曲率），类似于人工神经网络中的谱偏差。该电路对干扰。",
