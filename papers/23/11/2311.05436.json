    "translated_abstract": "数据精炼和核心集已成为生成用于处理大规模数据集的下游学习任务的较小代表性样本集的流行方法。与此同时，机器学习越来越多地应用于社会层面的决策过程，使得模型构建者必须解决存在于数据中的子群体的固有偏见问题。当前方法通过优化相对于原始样本的局部属性来创建公平的合成代表性样本，但其对下游学习过程的影响尚未被探索。在这项工作中，我们提出了公平的Wasserstein核心集（FWC），一种新颖的核心集方法，它生成既具有公平性的合成代表性样本，又具有用于下游学习任务的样本级权重。FWC最小化原始数据集与加权合成样本之间的Wasserstein距离，同时强制实现人口平等。我们展示了FWC的无约束版本等价于通常的最优传输问题，并且通过实验证明了FWC的有效性和公平性。",
