    "abstract": "Active learning, a widely adopted technique for enhancing machine learning models in text and image classification tasks with limited annotation resources, has received relatively little attention in the domain of Named Entity Recognition (NER). The challenge of data imbalance in NER has hindered the effectiveness of active learning, as sequence labellers lack sufficient learning signals. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reweighting-based active learning strategy that assigns dynamic smoothed weights to individual tokens. This adaptable strategy is compatible with various token-level acquisition functions and contributes to the development of robust active learners. Experimental results on multiple corpora demonstrate the substantial performance improvement achieved by incorporating our re-weighting strategy into existing acquisition functions, validating its practical efficacy.",

    "translated_abstract": "主动学习是一种被广泛应用于文本和图像分类任务中，通过有限的注释资源提升机器学习模型性能的技术。然而，在命名实体识别领域，主动学习相对较少被关注。命名实体识别中的数据不平衡问题妨碍了主动学习的效果，因为序列标记模型缺乏足够的学习信号。为了解决这些挑战，本文提出了一种基于重新加权的主动学习策略，为每个标记分配了动态平滑的权重。这种适应性策略与各种标记级采集函数兼容，并有助于开发健壮的主动学习器。在多个语料库上的实验结果表明，将我们的重新加权策略与现有的采集函数结合起来能够显著提高性能，验证了其实际有效性。",
