    "translated_abstract": "我们展示了物理学模拟与 NeRF 可以无缝集成，用于生成真实物体的高质量弹性动力学。与现有方法不同，我们以无网格的方式离散化非线性超弹性，避免了中间辅助形态代理物如四面体网格或体素网格的必要性。采用二次广义移动最小二乘（Q-GMLS）来捕捉隐式模型上的非线性动态和大形变。这种无网格集成使复杂和共维度形状的多功能模拟成为可能。我们根据 NeRF 密度场自适应地放置最小二乘核，显著降低非线性模拟的复杂性。因此，可以方便地使用我们的方法以交互速率合成各种高弹性材料的物理逼真动画。有关更多信息，请访问我们的项目页面https://fytalo",
