    "translated_abstract": "视觉丰富的文档实体检索(VDER)是一种从发票和收据等文档图像中提取关键信息(如日期、地址)的重要任务，在工业级自然语言处理应用中变得越来越重要。不断涌现的新的文档类型，每种类型都有其独特的实体类型，提出了一个独特的挑战：许多文档包含了仅出现几次的未知实体类型。解决这个挑战需要模型具有少样本学习实体的能力。然而，以前的少样本VDER工作主要在文档级别上解决了这个问题，使用预定义的全局实体空间，没有考虑到实体级别的少样本情景：目标实体类型由每个任务进行本地个性化，并且实体出现在文档中差异很大。为了解决这个未开发的情况，本文研究了一种新颖的实体级别少样本VDER任务。挑战在于每个任务的标签空间的唯一性和增长性。",
