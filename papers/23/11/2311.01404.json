    "translated_abstract": "\"归一化流\"一词与通过深度神经网络构建概率测度之间的可逆传输映射相关。本文考虑将$W_2$-最优传输映射$T$恢复为线性控制神经ODE的流动的问题。我们首先展示了在合适的假设下，对于绝对连续测度$\\mu,\\nu\\in\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$和受控向量场，最优传输映射包含在系统产生的流动的$C^0_c$闭包中。假设原始测度$\\mu,\\nu$的离散近似$\\mu_N,\\nu_N$可用，我们使用离散最优耦合$\\gamma_N$来定义最优控制问题。通过$\\Gamma$-收敛论证，我们证明其解对应于近似最优传输映射$T$的流动。最后，利用Pontryagin最大原理，我们提出了一种迭代数值方案来解决问题。",
