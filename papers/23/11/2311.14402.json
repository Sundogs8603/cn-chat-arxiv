    "translated_abstract": "测试时间适应（TTA）旨在在测试数据偏离训练分布时提高模型的泛化能力，其独特优势在于不需要访问训练数据和处理过程，尤其在大型预训练模型的背景下尤为重要。然而，当前的TTA方法未能解决根本问题：协变量转移，即降低的泛化能力可以归因于模型依赖训练数据的边际分布，这可能影响模型校准并引入确认偏见。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一种新颖的基于能量的视角，增强模型对目标数据分布的感知，而无需访问训练数据或处理过程。基于这一视角，我们引入了 $\\textbf{T}$est-time $\\textbf{E}$nergy $\\textbf{A}$daptation（$\\textbf{TEA}$），将经过训练的分类器转换为基于能量的模型，并使模型的分类边缘对齐。",
