To address this issue, we develop a novel decentralized stochastic bilevel gradient descent algorithm under the heterogeneous setting, which enjoys a small communication cost in each round and a small number of communication rounds. As such, it can achieve a much better communication complexity than existing algorithms without any strong assumptions regarding heterogeneity.

    "translated_abstract": "过去几年中，去中心化双层优化在机器学习中得到了广泛研究，因为它在现实世界任务中有着广泛的应用。然而，现有算法由于估计随机超梯度而导致通信复杂度较大，限制了它们在实际任务中的应用。为了解决这个问题，我们在异构设置下开发了一种新颖的去中心化随机双层梯度下降算法，每轮中具有较小的通信成本和较少的通信轮次。因此，它可以在没有任何关于异构性的强假设的情况下实现比现有算法更好的通信复杂度。据我们所知，这是第一个在异构设置下实现这些理论结果的随机算法。最后，实验结果证实了我们算法的有效性。",
