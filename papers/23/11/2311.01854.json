    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19的快速传播和新变种的出现凸显了有效筛查措施的重要性。及时诊断和随后的感染者隔离可以防止病毒在社会中进一步传播。虽然PCR测试是COVID-19诊断的金标准，但成本高且耗时长。相比之下，尿液试纸是一种廉价、非侵入性且快速获取的筛查方法，可提供关于患者健康状况的重要信息。在本研究中，我们收集了一个新的数据集，并使用尿液试纸参数的RGB（红绿蓝）色彩空间来检测个体的健康状况。为了提高模型的准确性，我们将RGB空间转换为其他10个颜色空间。经过评估四种不同的机器学习模型后，我们提出了一个基于多层感知器神经网络的新集成模型。虽然最初的结果并不强，但我们能够改进模型的精确度。",
