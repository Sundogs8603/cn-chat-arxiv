    "abstract": "Counterspeech, i.e., responses to counteract potential harms of hateful speech, has become an increasingly popular solution to address online hate speech without censorship. However, properly countering hateful language requires countering and dispelling the underlying inaccurate stereotypes implied by such language. In this work, we draw from psychology and philosophy literature to craft six psychologically inspired strategies to challenge the underlying stereotypical implications of hateful language. We first examine the convincingness of each of these strategies through a user study, and then compare their usages in both human- and machine-generated counterspeech datasets. Our results show that human-written counterspeech uses countering strategies that are more specific to the implied stereotype (e.g., counter examples to the stereotype, external factors about the stereotype's origins), whereas machine-generated counterspeech uses less specific strategies (e.g., generally denouncin",

    "translated_abstract": "反对怀有恶意的言论的对话已经成为一种越来越受欢迎的解决方式，以避免对线上恶意言论进行审查。然而，适当地对付恶意语言需要打破和驳斥这些语言所暗示的不准确刻板印象。在这项研究中，我们从心理学和哲学文献中汲取灵感，提出了六种心理学上启发的策略来挑战恶意语言所暗示的刻板印象。我们首先通过用户研究来研究每种策略的说服力，然后比较人类和机器生成的对话数据集中使用这些策略的情况。我们的结果表明，人类编写的对话使用了更与所暗示的刻板印象相关的挑战策略（例如，刻板印象的反例，关于刻板印象来源的外部因素），而机器生成的对话使用了更不具体的策略（例如，普遍抨击刻板印象）。",
