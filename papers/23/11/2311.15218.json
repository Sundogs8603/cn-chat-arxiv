    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在金融领域的应用已经变得非常常见，尤其在股票市场预测中更是如此。股票市场高度波动，全球每分钟都会产生大量数据。从这些数据中提取有效的智能信息十分重要。然而，将数字股票数据与定性文本数据结合起来可能是一项具有挑战性的任务。在这项工作中，我们通过提供一个史无前例的公开可用数据集，从新闻档案、电视新闻字幕、广播文本、推文、每日财经报纸等处收集到了包括技术和基本数据以及情感数据。用于情感提取的文本数据总共超过140万条。该数据集包含从2018年1月到2022年12月为期一年的八家代表不同产业部门的公司的每日数据，以及道琼斯工业平均指数（DJIA）整体的数据。综合的基本数据和技术数据可直接用于训练。",
    "tldr": "本研究提供了一个综合定量和定性分析的实时在线股票预测方法，通过提供一个包含了来自各种来源的数据集，将数字股票数据和定性文本数据结合起来进行分析。数据集包含了多个公司和道琼斯工业平均指数的数据，为训练提供了有效的数据基础。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study presents a real-time online stock forecasting approach that integrates quantitative and qualitative analysis. By providing a dataset that combines numerical stock data with qualitative text data from various sources, this research enables effective analysis. The dataset includes data from multiple companies and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, providing a solid foundation for training."
