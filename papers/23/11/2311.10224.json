The commonly used encoder-decoder architectures for cerebrovascular segmentation utilize redundant features, eventually leading to the extraction of low-level features multiple times. Additionally, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from performance degradation when the batch size is small, and deeper networks experience the vanishing gradient problem. Methods: In this paper, we attempt to solve these limitations and propose the 3D cerebrovascular attention UNet method, named CV-AttentionUNet, for precise extraction of brain vessel images. We proposed a sequence of preprocessing techniques followed by deeply supervised UNet to improve the accuracy of segmentation of the brain vessels leading to a stroke.
