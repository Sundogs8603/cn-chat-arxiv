    "abstract": "When we communicate with other humans, we do not simply generate a sequence of words. Rather, we use our cognitive state (beliefs, desires, intentions) and our model of the audience's cognitive state to create utterances that affect the audience's cognitive state in the intended manner. An important part of cognitive state is the common ground, which is the content the speaker believes, and the speaker believes the audience believes, and so on. While much attention has been paid to common ground in cognitive science, there has not been much work in natural language processing. In this paper, we introduce a new annotation and corpus to capture common ground. We then describe some initial experiments extracting propositions from dialog and tracking their status in the common ground from the perspective of each speaker.",

    "translated_abstract": "当我们与其他人交流时，我们不仅仅是生成一系列的词语。相反，我们使用我们的认知状态（信念，欲望，意图）和我们对听众认知状态的模型来创建对话，以预期的方式影响听众的认知状态。认知状态的一个重要组成部分是共同基础，即说话者相信，并且说话者认为听众相信，以此类推的内容。虽然认知科学中对共同基础已经付出了很多关注，但在自然语言处理领域并没有太多的相关工作。在本文中，我们介绍了一种新的注释和语料库来捕捉共同基础。然后，我们描述了一些从对话中提取命题并从每个说话者的角度跟踪它们在共同基础中的状态的初步实验。",
