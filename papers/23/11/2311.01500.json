    "translated_abstract": "我们提出使用对2D欧几里得群E(2)等变的群卷积神经网络架构（GCNNs）来进行星系形态分类的任务，通过利用星系图像中存在的对称性作为体系结构中的归纳偏差。我们通过引入人为扰动，如泊松噪声插入和单像素对抗攻击，进行鲁棒性研究，以模拟有限观测能力的影响。我们训练、验证和测试对E(2)的离散子群 - 循环群和二面体群 - 是等变的GCNNs，发现GCNNs实现了更高的分类准确性，并且在鲁棒性方面始终比非等变的对应物更好，在等变群D16实现了95.52±0.18%的测试集准确度。我们还发现该模型在50%噪声数据集上只损失不到6%的准确性，并且所有的GCNNs都对单像素扰动更不敏感。",
