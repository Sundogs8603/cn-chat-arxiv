    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2311.07215v2 公告类型：替换 摘要：代码编辑是确保程序综合的一个重要步骤，可以自动纠正代码LLMs生成的关键错误。最近的研究表明，闭源LLMs（如ChatGPT和GPT-4）能够生成纠正性反馈，用于编辑错误输入。然而，开源代码LLMs生成用于代码编辑的反馈仍然具有挑战性，因为这些模型倾向于遵循表面格式提供与误导信息相混淆的反馈。因此，我们的工作重点是利用开源代码LLMs生成具有正确指导的有用反馈用于代码编辑。为此引入了Coffee，一个专为带有反馈的代码修复而设计的数据集。利用该数据集，构建了CoffeePots，一个通过偏好优化调整和选择的COde Fixing with FEEdback框架。该框架旨在自动生成有用的反馈以帮助代码编辑。",
