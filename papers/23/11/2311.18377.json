    "translated_abstract": "机器学习由于其在有机材料虚拟筛选中的成本效益优于传统的计算密集型技术，正变得越来越受欢迎。然而，有机材料标记数据的稀缺性对于训练先进的机器学习模型构成了重要挑战。本研究展示了利用药物样小分子和化学反应数据库预训练BERT模型的潜力，从而增强其在有机材料虚拟筛选中的性能。通过将BERT模型与来自五个虚拟筛选任务的数据微调，使用USPTO-SMILES数据集预训练的版本在三个任务中实现了超过0.94的R2得分，其余两个任务的得分超过0.81。这一性能超过了在小分子或有机材料数据库上预训练的模型，并胜过了直接在虚拟筛选数据上训练的三个传统机器学习模型。",
