    "translated_abstract": "准确性是信息寻求对话中的一个至关重要的要求：系统应该对用户的查询做出响应，使得这些回复有意义且与系统提供的知识一致。然而，大多数现代大型语言模型存在幻觉现象，即它们生成的回复不受支持或与知识来源相矛盾。为了减轻这一问题并提高信息寻求对话系统的准确性，我们引入了BeInfo，这是一个简单而有效的方法，通过行为调整来帮助信息寻求对话。通过依赖于三个标准数据集，我们展示了通过BeInfo微调的模型在数据集和领域中变得更加忠实于知识来源，无论是在应用零-shot方式时看到的领域还是未看到的领域。此外，我们还展示了BeInfo微调的3B参数模型（如Flan-T5）表现出色能力。",
