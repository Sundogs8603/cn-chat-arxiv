    "translated_abstract": "离线强化学习任务中，一种流行的范例是先将离线轨迹拟合到一个序列模型中，然后通过该模型提示高期望回报的动作。虽然普遍认为表达性更强的序列模型可以带来更好的性能，但本文强调了可处理性，即精确而高效地回答各种概率查询的能力，同样起着重要的作用。具体而言，由于离线数据收集策略和环境动态带来的基本随机性，需要进行高度非平凡的条件/约束生成，以引出有奖励的动作。虽然仍然可以近似处理这些查询，但我们观察到这种粗糙的估计显著削弱了表达性强的序列模型带来的好处。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了Trifle（离线强化学习的可处理推理），它利用了现代可处理概率模型（TPM）来弥合这个差距。",
