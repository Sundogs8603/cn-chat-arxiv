    "abstract": "The paper describes a system developed for Task 1 at SMM4H 2023. The goal of the task is to automatically distinguish tweets that self-report a COVID-19 diagnosis (for example, a positive test, clinical diagnosis, or hospitalization) from those that do not. We investigate the use of different techniques for preprocessing tweets using four transformer-based models. The ensemble of fine-tuned language models obtained an F1-score of 84.5%, which is 4.1% higher than the average value.",
