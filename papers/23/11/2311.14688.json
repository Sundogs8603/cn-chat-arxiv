Inspired by John Rawls's advocacy for pure procedural justice, we view automated decision-making as a microcosm of social institutions, and consider how the data generating process itself can satisfy the requirements of procedural fairness. We propose a framework that decouples the objectionable data generating components from the neutral ones by utilizing reference points and the associated value instantiation rule. Our findings highlight the necessity of preventing disguised procedural unfairness, drawing attention not only to the objectionable data generating components that we aim to mitiga",

    "translated_abstract": "我们揭示并解决了经常被忽视但重要的问题，即伪装的程序不公平，即对数据生成过程中的中立（即不成问题的）方面的可能无意的改变，和/或对最不利利益个体的实现没有程序保证。受约翰·罗尔斯对纯程序公正的倡导启发，我们将自动决策视为社会制度的缩影，并考虑数据生成过程本身如何满足程序公平的要求。我们提出了一个框架，通过利用参考点和相关的价值实例化规则，将可抗议的数据生成组件与中立的数据生成组件解耦。我们的发现强调了防止伪装的程序不公平的必要性，不仅引起了我们力图缓解的可抗议的数据生成组件的注意",
