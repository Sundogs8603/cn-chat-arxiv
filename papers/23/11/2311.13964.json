    "abstract": "Interactive segmentation is a crucial research area in medical image analysis aiming to boost the efficiency of costly annotations by incorporating human feedback. This feedback takes the form of clicks, scribbles, or masks and allows for iterative refinement of the model output so as to efficiently guide the system towards the desired behavior. In recent years, deep learning-based approaches have propelled results to a new level causing a rapid growth in the field with 121 methods proposed in the medical imaging domain alone. In this review, we provide a structured overview of this emerging field featuring a comprehensive taxonomy, a systematic review of existing methods, and an in-depth analysis of current practices. Based on these contributions, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in the field. For instance, we find that there is a severe lack of comparison across methods which needs to be tackled by standardized baselines and benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "交互式分割是医学图像分析中的关键研究领域，旨在通过结合人类反馈来提高昂贵注释的效率。这些反馈以点击、涂鸦或掩膜的形式出现，允许对模型输出进行迭代优化，以便有效引导系统实现所需的行为。近年来，基于深度学习的方法推动了结果达到一个新水平，导致该领域快速增长，仅医学影像领域就提出了121种方法。在本综述中，我们提供了这一新兴领域的结构化概述，包括全面的分类法、现有方法的系统综述以及对当前实践的深入分析。基于这些贡献，我们讨论了该领域的挑战和机遇。例如，我们发现方法之间的比较严重缺乏，需要通过标准化基准和基准数据进行解决。",
    "tldr": "本综述系统地总结了医学图像交互式分割的最新研究进展，通过深度学习的方法推动了领域发展，但目前存在方法之间的比较缺乏的问题。",
