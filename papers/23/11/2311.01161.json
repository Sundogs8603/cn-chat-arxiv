In this paper, we propose a domain-agnostic filtering mechanism based on program execution results. Specifically, for each program obtained through the search process, we first construct a representation that captures the program's semantics as execution results under various inputs. Then, we run a majority vote on these representations to identify and filter out programs with significantly different semantics from the other programs. In particular, our method is orthogonal to the program search process so that it can easily augment any of the existing weakly supervised semantic parsing frameworks.

    "translated_abstract": "在弱监督下训练语义解析器时，虚假程序是一个长期存在的挑战。为了消除具有错误语义但正确指示的程序，现有的方法着重于利用基于领域特定知识的例子相似性。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于程序执行结果的领域无关筛选机制。具体而言，对于通过搜索过程获得的每个程序，我们首先构建一个表示，它以各种输入下的执行结果捕捉程序的语义。然后，我们对这些表示进行多数投票，以识别并过滤掉与其他程序具有明显不同语义的程序。特别是，我们的方法与程序搜索过程正交，因此可以轻松增强任何现有的弱监督语义解析框架。在自然语言视觉推理和WikiTableQuestions上进行了实证评估",
