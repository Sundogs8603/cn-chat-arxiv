    "abstract": "arXiv:2311.10788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Video DeepFakes are fake media created with Deep Learning (DL) that manipulate a person's expression or identity. Most current DeepFake detection methods analyze each frame independently, ignoring inconsistencies and unnatural movements between frames. Some newer methods employ optical flow models to capture this temporal aspect, but they are computationally expensive. In contrast, we propose using the related but often ignored Motion Vectors (MVs) and Information Masks (IMs) from the H.264 video codec, to detect temporal inconsistencies in DeepFakes. Our experiments show that this approach is effective and has minimal computational costs, compared with per-frame RGB-only methods. This could lead to new, real-time temporally-aware DeepFake detection methods for video calls and streaming.",

    "translated_abstract": "视频DeepFake是使用深度学习（DL）创建的虚假媒体，可操纵人的表情或身份。大多数当前的DeepFake检测方法独立分析每一帧，忽略帧间的不一致和不自然运动。一些较新的方法利用光流模型捕捉这种时序方面，但计算成本高昂。相比之下，我们提出使用来自H.264视频编解码器的相关但常被忽视的运动矢量（MVs）和信息掩模（IMs）来检测DeepFake中的时域不一致。我们的实验证明这种方法有效，并且与仅基于每帧RGB的方法相比具有最小的计算成本。这可能会导致新的、实时的时域感知DeepFake检测方法，用于视频通话和流媒体。",
