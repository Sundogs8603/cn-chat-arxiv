    "translated_abstract": "最近，我们展示了使用深度神经网络（DNN）进行实时不可观测分布系统的同步时间状态估计的成功。在这个论文中，我们提供了该状态估计器在输入测量扰动的情况下的性能的分析界限。已经有人表明，仅基于测试数据集来评估性能可能不能有效地说明训练好的DNN处理输入扰动的能力。因此，我们将输入扰动作为混合整数线性规划（MILP）问题从分析上验证了DNN对输入扰动的鲁棒性和可靠性。同时，我们还强调了批归一化在解决MILP公式的可扩展性限制方面的能力。该框架通过在修改后的IEEE 34节点系统和一个真实的大型分布系统上进行同步时间的配电系统状态估计来进行验证，这两个系统都是通过微相位测量不完全观测到的。",
