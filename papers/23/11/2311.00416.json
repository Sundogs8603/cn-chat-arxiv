    "translated_abstract": "开发能够与人类顺畅协同的智能代理是实现人工通用智能的关键一步。目前，人工智能与人类协同的现有方法通常训练一个代理与多样化的策略或基于真实人类数据拟合的人类模型进行协同。然而，人类行为的大规模多样性对于容量有限的AI系统来说是障碍，而高质量的人类数据在现实环境中可能不容易获取。在这项研究中，我们观察到在协同之前，人类进行交流以建立规则约定，指定个体角色和行动，使他们的协同顺利进行。基于这一观察结果，我们提出利用大型语言模型(LLM)来制定行动计划(或等效地，约定)，有效地指导人类和人工智能。通过输入任务要求、人类偏好、代理数量和其他相关信息",
