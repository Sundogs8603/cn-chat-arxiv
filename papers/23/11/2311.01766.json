    "translated_abstract": "在线误导信息已经成为一个国家级的社会问题，是各种在线伤害的主要来源之一。其中一种常见的误导信息形式是上下文错误（OOC）信息，其中不同的信息被错误地关联起来，例如真实图像与虚假的文本标题或误导性的文本描述。尽管一些研究试图通过外部证据来抵御上下文错误的误导信息，但它们往往忽视了不同立场的不同证据的作用。受到证据立场代表不同检测结果的偏见的启发，我们提出了一种能够在统一框架中提取多模态证据的立场的立场抽取网络（SEN）。此外，我们还引入了基于命名实体的共现关系计算的支持-反驳分数到文本SEN中。对公共大规模数据的大量实验证明了我们的方法的有效性。",

By considering the stances of different pieces of evidence, a more accurate detection method is provided, and a support-refutation score based on co-occurrence relations is introduced. Extensive experiments on public large-scale data demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach."
