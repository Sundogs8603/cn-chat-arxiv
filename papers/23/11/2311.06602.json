Together, these requirements make this domain difficult for large language models (LLMs). We introduce BizBench, a benchmark for evaluating models' ability to reason about realistic financial problems. BizBench comprises eight quantitative reasoning tasks, focusing on question-answering (QA) over financial data via program synthesis. We include three financially-themed code-generation tasks from newly collected and augmented QA data. Additionally, we isolate the reasoning capabilities required for financial QA: reading comprehension of financial text and tables for extracting intermediate values, and understanding financial concepts and formulas needed to calculate complex solutions. Collectively, these tasks evaluate a model's financial background knowledge, ability to parse financial documents, and capacity to s",

    "translated_abstract": "回答关于商业和金融领域的问题需要推理能力、准确性以及广泛的技术知识。本文介绍了BizBench，一个用于评估模型在推理现实财务问题方面能力的基准。BizBench包括八个量化推理任务，专注于通过程序合成对财务数据进行问答（QA）。我们包含了三个基于金融主题的代码生成任务，从新收集和扩充的QA数据中提取。此外，我们分离出了金融QA所需的推理能力：阅读财务文本和表格以提取中间值，理解计算复杂解决方案所需的金融概念和公式。总体而言，这些任务评估了模型的金融背景知识、解析财务文件的能力以及处理复杂解决方案的能力。",
