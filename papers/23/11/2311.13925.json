    "translated_abstract": "尽管世界卫生组织宣布大流行已经结束，但COVID-19仍然被视为一种地方性疾病。这次大流行以前所未有的方式打乱了人们的生活并导致广泛的发病率和死亡率。因此，紧急医生有必要确定高风险死亡患者，以便优先考虑医院设备的分配，尤其是在医疗资源有限的地区。尽管存在哪种数据最准确的预测的问题，但患者收集到的数据对于预测COVID-19病例的结果是有益的。因此，本研究旨在实现两个主要目标。首先，我们想要检查深度学习算法是否能够预测患者的死亡率。其次，我们研究了临床和RT-PCR对预测的影响，以确定哪个更可靠。我们定义了四个不同特征集的阶段，并使用可解释的深度学习方法构建了相应的模型。",
