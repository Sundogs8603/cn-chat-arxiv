Specifically, by delving into post content, we explore user attributes like writing habits, psychological states, and focal areas, thereby building the user profile for LS. For each attribute, we design the identified feature extraction module. The extracted features are mapped to high-dimensional user features via deep-learning networks from existing methods.

    "translated_abstract": "语言隐写分析任务旨在有效检测通过语言隐写术生成的隐写物。现有的隐写分析方法忽视了用户个性化特征，导致在社交网络中表现较差。隐写物的有限出现进一步增加了检测的复杂性。本文提出了一个新颖的框架 UP4LS，用于增强隐写分析性能，该框架采用用户信息为核心。具体来说，通过深入分析帖子内容，我们探索了用户属性，如写作习惯、心理状态和关注领域，从而为隐写分析构建了用户信息。对于每个属性，我们设计了特征提取模块。通过现有方法中的深度学习网络，将提取到的特征映射到高维用户特征上。然后，使用语言模型来提取内容特征。将用户和内容特征进行集成以优化特征表示。在训练阶段，我们优先考虑隐写物的分布。实验表明，UP4LS 可以有效提升隐写分析的性能。",
