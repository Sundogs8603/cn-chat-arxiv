However, current neural network-based PDE solvers often rely on extensive training data or labeled input-output pairs, making them prone to challenges in generalizing to out-of-distribution examples. To mitigate the generalization gap encountered by conventional neural network-based methods in estimating PDE solutions, we formulate a fully unsupervised approach, requiring no training data, to estimate finite difference solutions for PDEs directly via small convolutional neural networks. Our proposed algorithms demonstrate a comparable accuracy to the true solution for several selected elliptic and parabolic problems compared to the finite difference method.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，利用深度学习和神经网络解决科学问题，特别是求解偏微分方程（PDE），引起了广泛关注。然而，目前基于神经网络的PDE求解器往往依赖于大量的训练数据或标记的输入-输出对，这使得它们在推广到分布之外的示例时容易面临挑战。为了减少传统基于神经网络方法在估计PDE解时遇到的广义化差距，我们提出了一种完全无监督的方法，无需训练数据，通过小型卷积神经网络直接估计PDE的有限差分解。与有限差分法相比，我们提出的算法在几个选定的椭圆和抛物问题上表现出与真解相当的准确性。",
