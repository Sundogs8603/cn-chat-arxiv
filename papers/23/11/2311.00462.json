    "translated_abstract": "多细胞机器人设计旨在创建由许多细胞组成的机器人，以便能够高效地控制执行各种任务。过去的研究已经证明了生成各种任务的机器人的能力，但这些方法通常直接在庞大的设计空间中对机器人进行优化，导致了难以控制的复杂形态的机器人。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种新的多细胞机器人粗细设计方法。该策略首先寻求最佳的粗粒度机器人，然后逐步对其进行精细调整。为了解决在粗细转换过程中确定精细调整关节的挑战，我们引入了用于机器人设计的双曲嵌入 (HERD) 框架。HERD 在一个共享的双曲空间内统一了各种粒度的机器人，并利用改进的交叉熵方法进行优化。这个框架使得我们的方法能够自主地在双曲空间中确定探索的区域。",
