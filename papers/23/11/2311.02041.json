    "translated_abstract": "量子计算最近成为一项具有变革性的技术。然而，它所承诺的优势依赖于将量子操作有效地转化为可行的物理实现。在此工作中，我们使用生成式机器学习模型，具体而言是去噪扩散模型（DMs），以促进这种转化。通过文本条件，我们引导模型在基于门的量子电路中产生所需的量子操作。值得注意的是，DMs允许在训练过程中避免经典模拟量子动力学中固有的指数级开销，这是先前机器学习技术中一直存在的瓶颈。我们在两个任务上展示了该模型的能力：纠缠生成和酉编译。该模型在生成新电路方面表现出色，并支持典型的DM扩展，例如掩码和编辑，以使电路生成符合目标量子设备的约束条件。由于其灵活性和泛化能力，我们的方法可以应用于各种量子任务。",
