    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的基于主动学习的方法，可以高效地从有限数量的地面观测中估计物种的地理分布范围。我们将未测绘物种的范围建模为从一组不同物种的估计范围的加权组合。我们展示了可以使用在大规模弱监督社区收集的观测数据上训练的模型生成这个候选范围集合。基于此，我们开发了一种新的主动查询方法，顺序选择最能减少对未测绘物种范围的不确定性的地理位置进行访问。我们对我们的方法进行了详细评估，并使用包含一千种物种的专家推导范围的评估数据集将其与现有的主动学习方法进行比较。我们的结果表明，我们的方法优于其他主动学习方法，并且在仅使用有限观测数据时可以接近端到端训练模型的性能。",

By modeling the range of an unmapped species as a weighted combination of estimated ranges from different species and using models trained on weakly supervised observation data, they were able to generate candidate range sets and develop a new active querying approach for location selection. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of this method over other active learning methods and its comparable performance to end-to-end trained models with limited observation data."
