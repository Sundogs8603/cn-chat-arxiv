    "translated_abstract": "主题模型对于理解大量文档集合非常有价值，但是它们并不总是能够识别出最相关的主题。传统的概率和基于锚点的主题模型提供了允许用户引导模型指向更相关主题的交互版本。然而，神经主题模型缺乏这种交互功能。为了弥补这一不足，我们引入了一种用户友好的神经主题模型交互方法。这种交互允许用户为一个主题分配一个单词标签，从而更新主题模型，使主题中的单词与给定的标签密切对应。我们的方法包括两种不同类型的神经主题模型。第一种包括主题嵌入可训练且在训练过程中演变的模型。第二种涉及主题嵌入后训练集成的模型，提供了一种不同的主题细化方法。为了方便用户与这些神经主题模型的交互，我们还提出了一个交互式图形用户界面工具。",
