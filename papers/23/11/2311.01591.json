    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了在缺失保护属性的情况下学习公平图神经网络（GNNs）的问题。在许多相关任务中，决策可能会对特定社区产生不成比例的影响，而GNNs已经在这些任务中取得了最先进的结果。然而，现有的公平GNNs工作要么假设保护属性是完全被观察到的，要么假设缺失数据的填充是公平的。实际上，填充中的偏差会传播到模型的结果中，导致它们过高地估计了其预测的公平性。我们通过提出Better Fair than Sorry（BFtS），为公平GNNs使用的保护属性的公平缺失数据填充模型来解决这个挑战。BFtS背后的关键设计原则是填充应该近似于公平GNN的最困难情况，即在最优化公平性最困难的情况下。我们使用一个三方对抗方案来实现这个想法，在这个方案中，两个对手共同对抗公平GNN。通过使用合成和实际数据集的实验证明了BFtS的有效性。",
