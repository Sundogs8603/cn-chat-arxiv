Building upon the insight that video objects (e.g., human, animals, cars, etc.), the center of video analytics, are similar in spirit to objects modeled by traditional object-oriented languages, we propose to develop an object-oriented approach to video analytics.

    "translated_abstract": "视频分析广泛应用于当今系统和服务中。在视频分析的前沿是用户开发的视频查询，以找到特定感兴趣的对象。基于视频对象（例如人，动物，汽车等）与传统面向对象语言建模的对象相似的洞察力，我们提出了一种面向视频分析的面向对象方法。这种方法名为VQPy，包括一个前端（一种Python变体，其中包含用户可以表达视频对象及其交互的结构）和一个可扩展的后端，可以基于视频对象自动生成和优化管道。我们已经实施和开源了VQPy，它已经作为Cisco DeepVision框架的一部分产品化。",
