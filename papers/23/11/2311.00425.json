In this paper, we propose an Object and Scene environment Interaction aware (OSI-aware) system, which is a novel two-stream neural rendering system considering object and scene environment interaction. To obtain illuminating conditions from the mixture soup, the system successfully separates the interaction between objects and scene environment by intrinsic decomposition method. To study the corresponding changes to the scene appearance from object-level editing tasks, we introduce a depth map guided scene inpainting method and shadow rendering method by point matching strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our novel pipeline produce reasonable appearance",

    "translated_abstract": "基于神经隐式场的3D场景编辑方法已经引起了广泛关注，在3D编辑任务中取得了出色的结果。然而，现有的方法常常忽略了物体与场景环境之间的交互。场景外观的变化，如阴影，在渲染视图中无法显示。本文提出了一种考虑物体和场景环境交互的新型两流神经渲染系统(OSI-aware)，通过内在分解方法成功地分离了物体和场景环境之间的交互。为了研究物体级别编辑任务对场景外观的相应改变，我们引入了深度图引导的场景修复方法和点匹配策略的阴影渲染方法。大量实验证明我们的新流程产生了合理的外观",
