    "translated_abstract": "劳动力市场是一个复杂的生态系统，包括各种相互关联的实体，如行业、职业、技能和公司。由于缺乏将这些异质实体系统地映射在一起的方法，每个实体都被孤立地分析或仅通过成对关系，抑制了对整个生态系统的全面理解。在本研究中，我们介绍了\"Labor Space\"，这是通过应用具有微调的大型语言模型导出的异质劳动力市场实体的矢量空间嵌入。Labor Space展示了各种劳动力市场成分的复杂关系结构，促进了对行业、职业、技能和公司的一致综合分析，同时保留了特定类型的聚类。我们展示了其前所未有的分析能力，包括将异质实体定位在经济轴上，如“制造业-医疗保健”。此外，",
