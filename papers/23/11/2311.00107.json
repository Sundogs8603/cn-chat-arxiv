    "abstract": "We consider the problem of 3D seismic inversion from pre-stack data using a very small number of seismic sources. The proposed solution is based on a combination of compressed-sensing and machine learning frameworks, known as compressed-learning. The solution jointly optimizes a dimensionality reduction operator and a 3D inversion encoder-decoder implemented by a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). Dimensionality reduction is achieved by learning a sparse binary sensing layer that selects a small subset of the available sources, then the selected data is fed to a DCNN to complete the regression task. The end-to-end learning process provides a reduction by an order-of-magnitude in the number of seismic records used during training, while preserving the 3D reconstruction quality comparable to that obtained by using the entire dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑使用极少数地震源从预叠前数据进行3D地震反演的问题。所提出的解决方案基于压缩感知和机器学习框架的组合，称为压缩学习。该解决方案同时优化一个降维操作符和一个由深度卷积神经网络(DCNN)实现的3D反演编码器-解码器。通过学习一个稀疏的二值感知层来实现降维，该层选择可用地震源的一个小子集，然后选择的数据被输入到DCNN中完成回归任务。端到端的学习过程在训练期间减少了数量级的地震记录使用量，同时保持了与使用整个数据集相当的3D重建质量。",
