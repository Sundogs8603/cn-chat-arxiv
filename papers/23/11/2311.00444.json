    "abstract": "This work focuses on the novel problem setting of generating graphs conditioned on a description of the graph's functional requirements in a downstream task. We pose the problem as a text-to-text generation problem and focus on the approach of fine-tuning a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate graphs. We propose an inductive bias which incorporates information about the structure of the graph into the LLM's generation process by incorporating message passing layers into an LLM's architecture. To evaluate our proposed method, we design a novel set of experiments using publicly available and widely studied molecule and knowledge graph data sets. Results suggest our proposed approach generates graphs which more closely meet the requested functional requirements, outperforming baselines developed on similar tasks by a statistically significant margin.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究致力于生成在下游任务中以图的功能要求描述为条件的图形的新问题设置。我们将问题建立为文本到文本生成问题，并专注于细调预训练的大型语言模型（LLM）来生成图形的方法。我们提出了一种归纳偏差，将关于图的结构信息结合到LLM的生成过程中，通过在LLM的体系结构中引入消息传递层。为了评估我们提出的方法，我们设计了一系列新颖的实验，使用公开可得且被广泛研究的分子和知识图数据集。结果表明，我们提出的方法生成的图形更接近于所请求的功能要求，显著超过了在类似任务上开发的基准方法。",
