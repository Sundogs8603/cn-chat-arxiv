The investigation into these models is driven by their potential to significantly accelerate electronic structure calculations using machine learning, without requiring expensive first-principles datasets for training interatomic potentials. We find that the inference process of a popular diffusion model for de novo molecular generation is divided into an exploration phase, where the model chooses the atomic species, and a relaxation phase, where it adjusts the atomic coordinates to find a low-energy geometry. As training proceeds, we show that the model initially learns about the first-order structure of the potential energy surface, and then later learns about higher-order structure. We also find that the relaxation phase of the diffusion model can be re-purposed to sample the Boltzmann distributio",

    "translated_abstract": "我们对分子生成的扩散模型进行了调查，旨在更好地理解它们的预测与基于物理的计算结果的比较。对这些模型的研究是由于它们在使用机器学习大幅加速电子结构计算方面的潜力，而不需要昂贵的第一原理数据集来训练原子间势能。我们发现，用于生成新分子的一个流行的扩散模型的推断过程分为探索阶段（模型选择原子种类）和松弛阶段（模型调整原子坐标以寻找低能几何结构）。随着训练的进行，我们展示了模型最初学习了势能表面的一阶结构，然后逐渐学习了高阶结构。我们还发现，扩散模型的松弛阶段可以被重新用来采样玻尔兹曼分布。",

The inference process of the diffusion model involves an exploration phase and a relaxation phase, and the model can learn about both first-order and higher-order structures of the potential energy surface. The relaxation phase of the diffusion model can also be used for sampling the Boltzmann distribution."
