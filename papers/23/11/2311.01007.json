    "abstract": "People are relying on AI agents to assist them with various tasks. The human must know when to rely on the agent, collaborate with the agent, or ignore its suggestions. In this work, we propose to learn rules grounded in data regions and described in natural language that illustrate how the human should collaborate with the AI. Our novel region discovery algorithm finds local regions in the data as neighborhoods in an embedding space that corrects the human prior. Each region is then described using an iterative and contrastive procedure where a large language model describes the region. We then teach these rules to the human via an onboarding stage. Through user studies on object detection and question-answering tasks, we show that our method can lead to more accurate human-AI teams. We also evaluate our region discovery and description algorithms separately.",

    "translated_abstract": "人们越来越依赖于AI代理来帮助他们完成各种任务。人类必须知道何时依赖于代理，与代理合作或忽略其建议。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种通过数据区域和自然语言描述的学习规则的方法，以说明人类应该如何与AI合作。我们的新颖区域发现算法在嵌入空间中找到数据的局部区域作为邻域，纠正了人类的先验知识。然后，每个区域都通过迭代和对比过程进行描述，其中一个大型语言模型描述该区域。然后我们通过引导阶段将这些规则教给人类。通过在目标检测和问答任务上的用户研究，我们证明了我们的方法可以使人工智能团队更加准确。我们还分别评估了我们的区域发现和描述算法。",
