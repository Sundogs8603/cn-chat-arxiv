    "translated_abstract": "捆绑推荐旨在向用户推荐一组相关的项目，以改善用户体验和平台利润。现有的捆绑推荐模型已经从仅捕捉用户-捆绑交互发展到对用户、捆绑和项目之间的多个关系进行建模。CrossCBR尤其将跨视图对比学习纳入到两视图偏好学习框架中，显著提高了SOTA性能。然而，它有两个限制：1）两视图的构建未能充分利用用户、捆绑和项目之间的所有异构关系；2）\"早期对比和后期融合\"框架在捕捉用户偏好和推广到多个视图方面不够有效。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的多视图对比学习框架MultiCBR，用于捆绑推荐。首先，我们设计了一种能够捕捉用户-捆绑、用户-项目和...（摘要内容不全）",
