    "translated_abstract": "尽管生成型的大型语言模型在抽象摘要任务中表现出色，但它们面临两个重要挑战：模型庞大和易产生幻觉。幻觉是令人担忧的，因为它们降低了可靠性并引发安全问题。修剪是一种通过去除冗余权重来减小模型大小，实现更高效稀疏推理的技术。修剪后的模型在下游任务性能上与原始模型相当，因此在预算有限的情况下成为理想的替代选择。然而，修剪对语言模型在抽象摘要中产生幻觉的影响尚未被探索。本文通过对五个摘要数据集、两种最先进的修剪方法和五个经调试的语言模型进行了广泛的实证研究。令人惊讶的是，我们发现修剪后的语言模型产生幻觉的情况较原始模型要少。我们的分析表明，修剪后的模型更倾向于依赖指导信息。",
