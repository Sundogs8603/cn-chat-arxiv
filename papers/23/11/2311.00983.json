To solve IRPs, usually a two-stage approach is employed, where demand is predicted using machine learning techniques first, and then an optimization algorithm is used to minimize routing costs. Our experiment shows machine learning models fall short of achieving perfect accuracy because inventory levels are influenced by the dynamic business environment, which, in turn, affects the optimization problem in the next stage, resulting in sub-optimal decisions. In this paper, we formulate and propose a decision-focused learning-based approach to solving real-world IRPs.

    "translated_abstract": "库存配送问题（IRP）是供应链管理中的一个关键挑战，它涉及在考虑库存需求规划的不确定性的情况下优化有效的路径选择。为了解决IRP问题，通常采用两阶段的方法，首先使用机器学习技术预测需求，然后使用优化算法来最小化配送成本。我们的实验表明，机器学习模型在实现完美准确度方面存在不足，因为库存水平受动态业务环境的影响，进而影响到下一阶段的优化问题，导致次优决策。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于决策导向学习的方法来解决现实世界的IRP问题。这种方法在一个端到端的系统中直接集成了库存预测和路径优化，可能确保一个强大的供应链策略。",
