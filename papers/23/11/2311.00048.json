    "translated_abstract": "多实例学习（MIL）在弱监督的全切片图像（WSI）分类中被广泛使用。典型的MIL方法包括特征嵌入部分，通过预训练的特征提取器将实例嵌入到特征中，以及MIL聚合器，将实例嵌入组合成预测结果。目前的重点是通过自监督预训练来改进这些部分，并单独建模实例之间的相关性。在本文中，我们提出了一种稀疏编码的MIL（SC-MIL），同时通过利用稀疏字典学习来解决这两个方面。稀疏字典学习通过将实例表示为过完备字典中原子的稀疏线性组合来捕捉实例之间的相似性。此外，引入稀疏性可以通过抑制不相关的实例而保留最相关的实例，从而增强实例的特征嵌入。为了改善传统的特征嵌入和实例之间的相关性建模方法，we proposed a sparsely coded MIL.",
