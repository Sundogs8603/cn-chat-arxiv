    "translated_abstract": "无监督图像分割旨在在不使用人工注释的情况下将图像中的不同语义模式分组。类似地，图像聚类根据它们的语义内容搜索图像的分组，也不需要监督。经典地，这两个问题吸引了研究人员的关注，因为它们从坚实的数学概念中产生了具体的应用。随着深度学习的出现，科学界将注意力转向了基于复杂神经网络的解决方法，在这些领域取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但很少利用经典方法取得的进展。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于补丁的无监督图像分割策略，将深度聚类方法的无监督特征提取进展与经典的基于图的方法相结合。我们展示了一个简单的卷积神经网络，通过图割进行迭代正则化，可以自然地实现最先进的分割效果。",
