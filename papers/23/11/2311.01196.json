    "translated_abstract": "尽管随着图神经网络（GNNs）的发展，图上的链接预测已经取得了巨大的成功，但其在边缘噪声下的鲁棒性潜力仍然较少被研究。为了填补这个空白，我们首先进行了一项经验研究，揭示了边缘噪声双向干扰了输入拓扑和目标标签，导致性能严重下降和表示崩溃。为了解决这个困境，我们提出了一种信息论引导的原则，稳健的图信息瓶颈（RGIB），用于提取可靠的监督信号并避免表示崩溃。与基本的信息瓶颈不同，RGIB进一步解耦和平衡了图拓扑、目标标签和表示之间的相互依赖关系，为抗双边噪声的稳健表示构建了新的学习目标。我们探索了两种实例化方法，即RGIB-SSL和RGIB-REP，以利用不同方法的优势，即自监督学习和数据重建。",
