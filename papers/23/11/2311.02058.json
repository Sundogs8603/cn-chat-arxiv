    "abstract": "We introduce LOTUS, a continual imitation learning algorithm that empowers a physical robot to continuously and efficiently learn to solve new manipulation tasks throughout its lifespan. The core idea behind LOTUS is constructing an ever-growing skill library from a sequence of new tasks with a small number of human demonstrations. LOTUS starts with a continual skill discovery process using an open-vocabulary vision model, which extracts skills as recurring patterns presented in unsegmented demonstrations. Continual skill discovery updates existing skills to avoid catastrophic forgetting of previous tasks and adds new skills to solve novel tasks. LOTUS trains a meta-controller that flexibly composes various skills to tackle vision-based manipulation tasks in the lifelong learning process. Our comprehensive experiments show that LOTUS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 11% in success rate, showing its superior knowledge transfer ability compared to prior methods.

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种名为LOTUS的持续模仿学习算法，它使得物理机器人能够在其整个寿命中持续而高效地学习解决新的操作任务。LOTUS的核心思想是通过一系列新任务的少量人类演示构建一个不断增长的技能库。LOTUS首先使用开放词汇视觉模型进行持续技能发现过程，该模型从未分段的演示中提取重复出现的技能模式。持续技能发现更新现有技能以避免对以前任务的灾难性遗忘，并添加新技能以解决新任务。LOTUS训练一个元控制器，在终身学习过程中灵活地组合各种技能来解决基于视觉的操作任务。我们的综合实验证明，与先前方法相比，LOTUS在成功率上超过了现有技术基线方法11％以上，显示了其优越的知识传递能力。",
