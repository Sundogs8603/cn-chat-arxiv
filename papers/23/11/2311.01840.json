    "translated_abstract": "图聚类旨在发现节点的自然分组，使得相似的节点被分配到一个共同的聚类中。许多不同的算法已经在文献中提出：对于简单图，对于带有节点属性的图，以及对于边表示节点之间不同类型关系的图。然而，许多领域中的复杂数据可以表示为既具有属性又具有多关系的网络。在本文中，我们提出了SpectralMix，一种针对具有分类节点属性的多关系图的联合降维技术。SpectralMix整合了来自属性、不同类型关系和图结构的所有可用信息，以便对聚类结果进行合理解释。此外，它还推广了现有技术：当仅应用于单个图时，它会变为谱嵌入和聚类；当应用于分类数据时，它将变为均一性分析。实验通过在多个数据集上进行聚类分析，验证了SpectralMix的有效性和性能优势。",
