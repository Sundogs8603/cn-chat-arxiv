    "abstract": "In this paper, we present analytical proof demonstrating that the Sandwiched Volterra Volatility (SVV) model is able to reproduce the power-law behavior of the at-the-money implied volatility skew, provided the correct choice of the Volterra kernel. To obtain this result, we assess the second-order Malliavin differentiability of the volatility process and investigate the conditions that lead to explosive behavior in the Malliavin derivative. As a supplementary result, we also prove a general Malliavin product rule.",
