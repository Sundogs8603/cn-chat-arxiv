    "translated_abstract": "真实的模拟是实现自动驾驶车辆安全和可扩展开发的关键。核心组件是模拟传感器，以便整个自动驾驶系统能在模拟中进行测试。传感器模拟涉及对交通参与者（如车辆）进行建模，具有高质量的外观和可调整几何形状，并实时进行渲染。自动驾驶行业通常需要艺术家来构建这些元素。然而，这种方法成本高、速度慢，并且可能无法反映真实情况。相反，通过从野外收集的传感器数据自动重建元素，可以更好地生成多样化且覆盖真实世界的大量元素。然而，当前的重建方法在野外传感器数据上存在困难，主要原因是其稀疏性和噪声。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了CADSim，它通过一小组不同可微渲染的CAD模型，结合部件感知的目标类别先验知识，自动重建车辆的几何形状。",
