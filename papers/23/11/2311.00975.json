    "abstract": "Can a micron sized sack of interacting molecules autonomously learn an internal model of a complex and fluctuating environment? We draw insights from control theory, machine learning theory, chemical reaction network theory, and statistical physics to develop a general architecture whereby a broad class of chemical systems can autonomously learn complex distributions. Our construction takes the form of a chemical implementation of machine learning's optimization workhorse: gradient descent on the relative entropy cost function. We show how this method can be applied to optimize any detailed balanced chemical reaction network and that the construction is capable of using hidden units to learn complex distributions. This result is then recast as a form of integral feedback control. Finally, due to our use of an explicit physical model of learning, we are able to derive thermodynamic costs and trade-offs associated to this process.",

    "translated_abstract": "一颗微米大小的相互作用分子囊是否能够自主学习复杂且波动的环境的内部模型？我们从控制理论、机器学习理论、化学反应网络理论和统计物理学中汲取了经验，开发出一种通用架构，使得广泛类别的化学系统能够自主学习复杂分布。我们的构造采用了机器学习中优化的核心方法：相对熵损失函数上的梯度下降的化学实现。我们展示了如何应用这种方法来优化任何一个详细平衡的化学反应网络，并且这个构造能够使用隐藏单元来学习复杂分布。这个结果又被重新解释为积分反馈控制的形式。最后，由于我们使用了显式的物理学习模型，我们能够推导出与这个过程相关的热力学成本和权衡。",
