    "translated_abstract": "在自动驾驶领域，离线强化学习方法在解决来自离线数据集的顺序决策问题方面表现出显著的效果。然而，在各种安全关键场景中保持安全性仍然是一个重要挑战，因为离线数据集中缺乏长尾和无法预见的场景。在本文中，我们引入了saFety-aware strUctured Scenario representatION (FUSION)，这是一种离线强化学习中的开创性表示学习方法，通过利用结构化场景信息促进学习可泛化的端到端驾驶策略。FUSION利用分解奖励、成本、状态和动作空间之间的因果关系，构建了一个在动态交通环境中进行结构化顺序推理的框架。我们在自动驾驶领域的两个典型真实世界设定下进行了广泛的评估。",
