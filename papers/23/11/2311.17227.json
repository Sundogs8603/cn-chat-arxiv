    "translated_abstract": "我们能否在历史的十字路口避免战争？这个问题在人类历史上一直被个人、学者、决策者和组织追求。在这项研究中，我们尝试根据人工智能（AI）和大语言模型（LLM）的最新进展来回答这个问题。我们提出了一种名为WarAgent的LLM驱动的多智能体AI系统，以模拟参与国家，在历史上的国际冲突，包括第一次世界大战（WWI）、第二次世界大战（WWII）和中国古代的战国时期（WSP）中的决策和后果。通过评估模拟的有效性，我们研究了尖端AI系统在研究复杂的集体人类行为，如国际冲突在不同环境下的能力的进展和局限性。在这些模拟中，智能体之间的相互作用也为考察引发战争的触发因素和条件提供了一种新视角。我们的发现为了解战争的触发因素和条件提供了新的观点。",
