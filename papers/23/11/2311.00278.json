    "translated_abstract": "少样本目标检测是社区中的一个新兴挑战，主要关注使用少量标注来检测新颖对象。最近的研究表明，采用预训练模型或修改损失函数可以提高性能。本文中，我们探索在低数据设置下利用对比性语言-图像预训练（CLIP）和困难负面分类损失的能力。具体地，我们提出了一种利用图像-语言相似度进行重新评分的少样本目标检测方法（RISF），通过引入使用CLIP的校准模块（CM-CLIP）和背景负面重新缩放损失（BNRL）来扩展Faster R-CNN。前者通过使用图像-类别相似性将检测器的分类得分进行零样本分类，后者是修改的分类损失，考虑了对广义少样本目标检测数据集中虚假背景和混淆类别的惩罚。在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC上进行了大量实验，结果表明...",
