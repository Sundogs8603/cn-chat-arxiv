    "translated_abstract": "形式化方法指的是系统开发中严谨的、数学方法，对于确立安全关键系统的正确性起着关键作用。形式化方法的主要构建模块是模型和规范，类似于系统设计中的行为和需求，它们给我们提供了验证和合成系统行为的手段和形式化保证。本专著对自主系统领域中形式化方法应用的最新研究进行了综述。我们考虑在不同的形式化条件下进行构造正确性合成，包括封闭系统、反应式系统和概率设置等。除了在已知环境中合成系统外，我们还通过形式化方法处理了不确定性的概念，并对采用学习的系统行为进行了限制。此外，我们还研究了与监测相关的系统合成，这是一种保证系统在偏离预期行为后仍能找到一种方式的缓解技术。",
