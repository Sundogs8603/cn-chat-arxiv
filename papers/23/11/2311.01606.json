    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了KG-FRUS数据集，该数据集包含超过30万份美国政府外交文件，并以知识图谱（KG）的形式进行编码。我们利用《美国对外关系》（FRUS）的数据（以XML文件形式提供），提取其中关于文件、个人和国家的信息。我们使用提取的实体及其相关元数据创建了一个基于图的数据集。此外，我们还从Wikidata中补充了额外的实体和关系。KG中的关系捕捉了研究和理解外交、国际关系和政治等复杂领域所需的协同和动力。这远远超出了仅仅收集文件而忽略文本中实体之间关系的简单集合。我们通过演示不同的探索KG方法展示了该数据集的各种可能性。在本文中，我们展示了如何使用查询语言来回答简单的研究问题。",
