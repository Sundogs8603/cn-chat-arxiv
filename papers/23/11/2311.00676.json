    "translated_abstract": "基于遗憾匹配的算法，特别是遗憾匹配+ (RM+)及其变种，是解决大规模双人零和游戏的最流行方法。与具有零和游戏的强最终迭代和遍历收敛性质的算法（如乐观梯度上升）不同，我们对于遗憾匹配算法的最终迭代性质几乎一无所知。鉴于最终迭代收敛性对于数值优化和模拟现实世界中的游戏学习的重要性，本文研究了各种流行的RM+变体的最终迭代收敛性质。首先，我们通过数值实验证明，包括同时RM+、交替RM+和同时预测RM+在内的几个实际变体，甚至在简单的3x3游戏中也缺乏最终迭代收敛保证。然后，我们证明了这些算法的最近变体，基于平滑技术得到了最终迭代收敛性。",
