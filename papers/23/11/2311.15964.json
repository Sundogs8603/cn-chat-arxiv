Manually annotating steps and writing instructions is costly, which limits the size of current datasets and hinders effective learning. Leveraging large but noisy video-transcript datasets for pre-training can boost performance, but demands significant computational resources. Furthermore, transcripts contain irrelevant content and exhibit style variation compared to instructions written by human annotators. To mitigate both issues, we propose a technique, Sieve-&-Swap, to automatically curate a smaller dataset: (i) Sieve filters irrelevant transcripts and (ii) Swap enhances the quality of the text instruction by automatically replacing the transcripts with human-written instructions from a text-only recipe dataset.

    "translated_abstract": "过程视频展示了诸如食谱准备等任务的逐步演示。理解此类视频具有挑战性，需要对步骤进行精确定位并生成文字说明。手动注释步骤并编写说明成本高昂，这限制了当前数据集的规模并阻碍了有效学习。利用大规模但嘈杂的视频-文本数据集进行预训练可以提升性能，但需要大量计算资源。此外，文本转录包含无关内容，与人类注释员编写的说明相比存在风格变化。为了缓解这两个问题，我们提出了一种技术，Sieve-&-Swap，通过自动筛选出不相关文本和使用文本食谱数据集中人类编写的说明自动替换文本转录以增强文字指令的质量。",
