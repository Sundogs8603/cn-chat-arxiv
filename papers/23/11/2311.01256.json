    "translated_abstract": "大部分机器学习研究评估最佳解决方案的性能。然而，在追求最佳性能的竞争中，经常忽视许多重要因素，而事实上，这些因素应该被仔细考虑。实际上，有时不同方法之间的性能差距可以忽略不计，而生产成本、能源消耗和碳足迹等因素必须考虑在内。大型语言模型（LLMs）被广泛应用于学术界和工业界的NLP问题。在这项工作中，我们在LexGLUE基准上对LLM和传统方法（例如SVM）进行了详细的定量比较，同时考虑性能（标准指标）和其他指标，如时间、耗能和成本，总之就是碳足迹。在我们的分析中，我们分别考虑了原型设计阶段（通过训练-验证-测试迭代进行模型选择）和生产阶段。",
