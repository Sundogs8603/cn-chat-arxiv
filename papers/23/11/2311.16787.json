Navigating further research in these high-resource settings is thus difficult. In this article, we propose a methodology for creating more reliable document-level human reference translations, called \"optimal reference translations,\" with the simple aim to raise the bar of what should be deemed \"human translation quality.\" We evaluate the obtained document-level optimal reference translations in comparison with \"standard\" ones, confirming a significant quality increase and also documenting",
