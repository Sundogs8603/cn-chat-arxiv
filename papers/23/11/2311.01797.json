    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型是一类生成模型，用于建立一个随机传输映射，将经验观测到的但未知的目标分布与已知的先验分布联系起来。尽管在实际应用中取得了显著的成功，但对其泛化能力的理论理解仍未充分发展。本文对扩散模型的泛化属性进行了全面的理论研究。我们建立了基于评分法的扩散模型的训练动态中泛化差距的理论估计，表明在样本大小$n$和模型容量$m$上都存在多项式小的泛化误差($O(n^{-2/5}+m^{-4/5})$)，在停止训练时可以避免维度诅咒（即数据维度不呈指数级增长）。此外，我们将定量分析扩展到了一个数据依赖的情景，其中目标分布被描绘为一系列的概率密度函数。",

Furthermore, it extends the quantitative analysis to a data-dependent scenario."
