We delve into essential requirements including privacy, latency, reliability as well as the satisfaction of users and advertisers which such a system must fulfill. We further introduce a general framework for LLM advertisement, consisting of modification, bidding, prediction, and auction modules. Different design considerations for each module is presented, with an in-depth examination of their practicality and the technical challenges inherent to their implementation.
