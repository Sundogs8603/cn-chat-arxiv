    "translated_abstract": "我提出了气候冲击对冲突的影响的新证据。利用覆盖1997年至2023年整个非洲大陆的详细冲突和天气数据，我发现在农作物生长季遭受El Niño事件对夏季采摘后期农田的政治暴力具有负差异效应。相对于长期均值，热带太平洋海面温度上升1°C（典型的中强度El Niño事件的代表）至少导致政治暴力与针对平民的冲突减少三个百分点。这一主要发现通过一系列稳健性检验得到支持，支持了农业是连接气候冲击与政治暴力之间的关键途径，而贪婪是关键动机。令人放心的是，当我使用更适合揭示提出的机制的数据子集时，估计效应的幅度几乎翻了一番，而这种效应仅仅存在于农作物生长季和夏季采摘后期的农田中。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study provides new evidence on the impact of climate shocks on conflict, showing that El Niño events have a negative effect on political violence in croplands during the postharvest season. Specifically, a 1°C increase in sea surface temperature, indicative of a moderate-strength El Niño event, leads to a three percent reduction in political violence targeting civilians. This finding supports the notion that agriculture is the key channel linking climatic shocks and political violence."
