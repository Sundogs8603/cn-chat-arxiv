However, LLMs still lack a crucial ability: communication skills. This limitation renders them more like information seeking tools rather than anthropomorphic chatbots. Communication skills, such as topic transition, proactively asking questions, concept guidance, empathy, and summarising often should be taken into consideration, to make LLMs more anthropomorphic and proactive during the conversation, thereby increasing the interest of users and attracting them to chat for longer. However, enabling these communication skills in black-box LLMs remains a key challenge because they do not have the same utterance formation mode as real people: think before speaking.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现进一步提高了开放领域对话系统的能力，可以生成流畅、连贯和多样化的回复。然而，LLMs仍然缺乏一项关键能力：沟通技巧。这种局限使它们更像信息搜索工具，而不是拟人化的聊天机器人。需要考虑沟通技能，如主题过渡、主动提问、概念引导、同理心和总结，使LLMs在对话中更具拟人化和主动性，从而增加用户的兴趣，吸引他们进行更长时间的交谈。然而，在黑匣子LLMs中启用这些沟通技能仍然是一个关键挑战，因为它们没有与真人相同的话语形成模式：先思后说。受语言学和认知科学启发，我们通过内在思考赋予LLMs沟通技能。",
