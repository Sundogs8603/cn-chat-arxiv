    "translated_abstract": "传统的重传（ARQ）协议旨在确保接收方正确接收到发射方的所有分组。当发射方是一个学习者与一个教师进行通信时，这个目标与学习者的实际目标相冲突，学习者的目标是从教师那里获取最相关的标签信息。从主动学习的角度出发，本文解决以下关键协议设计问题：(i)主动批次选择：应该发送哪个批次的输入给教师以获取最有用的信息，从而减少通信轮次的数量？(ii)批次编码：是否可以组合数据点的批次以减少每个通信轮次所需的通信资源？具体而言，本研究引入了通信受限的贝叶斯主动知识蒸馏（CC-BAKD），这是一种通过线性混合机制将贝叶斯主动学习与压缩相结合的新型协议。",
