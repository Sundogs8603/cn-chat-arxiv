It is a collection of unique tasks about generating colored grids, specified by a few examples only. In contrast to the transformation-based programs of existing work, we introduce object-centric models that are in line with the natural programs produced by humans. Our models can not only perform predictions, but also provide joint descriptions for input/output pairs. The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is used to efficiently search the large model space. A diverse range of tasks are solved, and the learned models are similar to the natural programs. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by applying it to a different domain.",
