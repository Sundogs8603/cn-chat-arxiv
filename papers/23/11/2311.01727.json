    "translated_abstract": "神经网络在量子计算的各种任务中显示出了其有效性。然而，在量子误差缓解中的应用受到对无噪声统计的依赖限制，这是实现实际量子进展的关键步骤。为了解决这一关键挑战，我们提出了一种数据增强强化的神经模型用于误差缓解（DAEM）。我们的模型不需要任何关于特定噪声类型和测量设置的先验知识，并且可以仅根据目标量子过程的噪声测量结果估计无噪声统计值，使其非常适合实际实施。在数值实验中，我们展示了该模型在缓解各种类型的噪声（包括马尔可夫噪声和非马尔可夫噪声）方面与先前的误差缓解方法相比的优越性能。我们进一步通过利用该模型来缓解多种类型的量子过程中的错误来展示其多功能性。",
