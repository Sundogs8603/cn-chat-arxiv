    "translated_abstract": "在短时间内向多个问题导向学习小组提供个性化的形成性反馈几乎是不可能的。我们使用ChatGPT来提供个性化的形成性反馈，在一个小时的Zoom分组活动中教授从业卫生专业人员如何为数字卫生计划制定评估计划。学习者完成了包括Likert量表和开放式问题的评估调查，并进行了分析。44名调查受访者中有一半从未使用过ChatGPT。总体而言，受访者对反馈持积极评价，描述了各种不同的小组动态，并对反馈做出了适应性回应，但只有三个小组使用反馈循环来改进他们的评估计划。未来的教育者可以从我们的经验中学习，包括设计提示、提供如何使用ChatGPT的说明，以及为ChatGPT的最佳小组互动提供支持。未来的研究者应该探索ChatGPT对小组动态的影响。",
