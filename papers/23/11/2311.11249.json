    "translated_abstract": "随着物联网设备的广泛应用，保护它们免受恶意入侵变得至关重要。然而，物联网数据的稀缺性限制了传统入侵检测方法的适用性，这些方法高度依赖于数据。为了解决这个问题，我们在本文中提出了基于无监督异构领域适应的开放集dandelion网络（OSDN）。OSDN模型通过从知识丰富的源网络入侵领域进行入侵知识传输，从而实现对数据稀缺的目标物联网入侵领域的更准确的入侵检测。在开放集设置下，它还能检测到在源领域中未观测到的新兴目标领域入侵。为了实现这一点，OSDN模型将源领域形成一个类似蒲公英的特征空间，其中每个入侵类别被紧密分组并且不同的入侵类别被分隔开，即同时强调了类别间的可分性和类别内的紧凑性。",
