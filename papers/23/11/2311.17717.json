    "abstract": "arXiv:2311.17717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models aims to disable pre-trained diffusion models from generating images related to a target concept. To perform reliable concept erasure, the properties of robustness and locality are desirable. The former refrains the model from producing images associated with the target concept for any paraphrased or learned prompts, while the latter preserves its ability in generating images with non-target concepts. In this paper, we propose Reliable Concept Erasing via Lightweight Erasers (Receler). It learns a lightweight Eraser to perform concept erasing while satisfying the above desirable properties by proposed concept-localized regularization and adversarial prompt learning schemes. Comprehensive experiments with various concepts verify the superiority of Receler over previous methods. Our code will be available upon acceptance.",

    "translated_abstract": "在文本到图像扩散模型中，概念擦除旨在禁用预训练的扩散模型生成与目标概念相关的图像。为了实现可靠的概念擦除，希望具备鲁棒性和局部性的属性。前者阻止模型为任何释义或学习提示生成与目标概念相关的图像，而后者保持其生成具有非目标概念的图像的能力。在本文中，我们提出了通过轻量级橡皮擦（Receler）来实现可靠的概念擦除。它学习了一个轻量级的橡皮擦来进行概念擦除，同时通过提出的概念定位正则化和对抗提示学习方案满足上述理想特性。通过对各种概念的全面实验验证了Receler相对于先前方法的优越性。我们的代码将在接受后提供。",
