    "abstract": "Large language models have shown good performances in generating code to meet human requirements. However, human requirements expressed in natural languages can be vague, incomplete, and ambiguous, leading large language models to misunderstand human requirements and make mistakes. Worse, it is difficult for a human user to refine the requirement. To help human users refine their requirements and improve large language models' code generation performances, we propose ChatCoder: a method to refine the requirements via chatting with large language models. We design a chat scheme in which the large language models will guide the human users to refine their expression of requirements to be more precise, unambiguous, and complete than before. Experiments show that ChatCoder has improved existing large language models' performance by a large margin. Besides, ChatCoder has the advantage over refine-based methods and LLMs fine-tuned via human response.",

    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型在生成满足人类需求的代码方面显示出良好的性能。然而，用自然语言表达的人类需求可能含糊、不完整和歧义，导致大规模语言模型误解人类需求并产生错误。更糟糕的是，人类用户很难细化需求。为了帮助人类用户细化需求并提高大规模语言模型的代码生成性能，我们提出了ChatCoder：一种通过与大规模语言模型聊天来细化需求的方法。我们设计了一个聊天方案，其中大规模语言模型将指导人类用户细化需求的表达，使其比以前更加精确、明确和完整。实验证明，ChatCoder大幅提高了现有大规模语言模型的性能。此外，ChatCoder具有优于基于维修的方法和通过人类响应微调的LLMs的优势。",
