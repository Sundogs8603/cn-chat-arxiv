    "abstract": "Metaphor identification aims at understanding whether a given expression is used figuratively in context. However, in this paper we show how existing metaphor identification datasets can be gamed by fully ignoring the potential metaphorical expression or the context in which it occurs. We test this hypothesis in a variety of datasets and settings, and show that metaphor identification systems based on language models without complete information can be competitive with those using the full context. This is due to the construction procedures to build such datasets, which introduce unwanted biases for positive and negative classes. Finally, we test the same hypothesis on datasets that are carefully sampled from natural corpora and where this bias is not present, making these datasets more challenging and reliable.",

    "translated_abstract": "隐喻识别旨在理解给定表达是否在特定语境中以比喻的方式使用。然而，在这篇论文中，我们展示了现有的隐喻识别数据集如何通过完全忽略潜在的隐喻表达或其所在的语境来进行操纵。我们在各种数据集和设置中测试了这个假设，并表明基于不具有完整信息的语言模型的隐喻识别系统可以与使用完整上下文的系统相竞争。这是由于构建这些数据集的过程中引入了对正负类别的不希望的偏见。最后，我们在从自然语料库中精心抽样的不存在这种偏见的数据集上测试了同样的假设，使得这些数据集更具挑战性和可靠性。",
