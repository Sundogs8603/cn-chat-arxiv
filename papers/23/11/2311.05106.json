    "translated_abstract": "大脑模拟建立动力学模型以模仿大脑的结构和功能，而大脑启发计算（BIC）通过从大脑的结构和功能中学习来发展智能系统。这两个领域相互交织，应共享一个通用的编程框架以促进彼此的发展。然而，由于传统的大脑模拟器在训练方面缺乏可微分性，而现有的深度学习（DL）框架无法捕捉大脑动力学的生物物理现实性和复杂性，因此这两者之间无法实现目标。本文介绍了BrainPy，一个使用JAX和XLA开发的可微分大脑模拟器，旨在架起大脑模拟与BIC之间的鸿沟。BrainPy在JAX强大的AI框架功能基础上扩展，引入了完整的功能，用于灵活、高效和可扩展的大脑模拟。",
