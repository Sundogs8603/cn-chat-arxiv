In this paper, we propose a novel approach that only uses lyrics as input to automatically generate a fitting time signature for lyrical songs and uncover the latent rhythmic structure utilizing explainable machine learning models.

    "translated_abstract": "最近对于人工智能生成内容(AIGC)的兴趣急剧增加。然而，尚未对音乐组成部分如节拍记号进行足够的研究，以制定新作品的算法确定方法，尤其是歌词歌曲。这可能是因为忽视了音乐细节，而音乐细节对于构建强大的框架至关重要。具体而言，节拍记号为歌曲的几乎所有方面(包括短语和音符)建立了基础的节奏结构。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，仅使用歌词作为输入，自动生成适合歌词歌曲的节拍记号，并利用可解释的机器学习模型揭示潜在的节奏结构。具体而言，我们设计了多种与发现歌词模式和创建同时包含歌词、节奏和统计信息的新特征相关的方法。在这种方法中，",
