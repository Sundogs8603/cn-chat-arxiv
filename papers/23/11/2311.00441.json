    "translated_abstract": "Vision Transformer (ViT)在计算机视觉任务中表现出与最先进的神经网络相媲美的性能。然而，这种新型的深度神经网络架构易受到对抗攻击的影响，从而限制了其鲁棒性能。本文提出了一种旨在进一步提高ViT的准确性和鲁棒性的新方法，特别是在面对对抗攻击时。我们提出了一种称为“动态扫描增强”的增强技术，利用动态输入序列来自适应地聚焦于不同的图像块，从而保持性能和鲁棒性。我们的详细研究揭示了这种对输入序列的适应性会导致ViT的注意力机制发生显著变化，即使对于相同的图像也是如此。我们引入了四种Dynamic Scanning Augmentation的变体， 在对抗攻击的鲁棒性和对自然图像的准确性方面均胜过ViT，其中一种变体表现最佳。",
