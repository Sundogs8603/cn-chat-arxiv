    "translated_abstract": "神经算子已被用作模拟物理系统的替代模型，以克服传统偏微分方程求解器的局限性。然而，大多数现有的算子学习方法假设数据来自单一物理机制，限制了它们在更现实的场景中的适用性和性能。为此，我们提出了一种称为PIANO（Physical Invariant Attention Neural Operator）的方法，用于解读和整合来自具有多种物理机制的PDE序列中的物理不变量（PI）来进行算子学习。PIANO采用自监督学习来提取物理知识，并采用注意机制将其整合到动态卷积层中。与现有技术相比，PIANO在具有不同系数、力或边界条件的PDE预测任务中，可以将相对误差减少13.6\\% - 82.2\\%。此外，多种下游任务表明，PIANO解读的PI嵌入与u对齐。",
