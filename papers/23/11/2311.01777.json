    "abstract": "The global challenge in chest radiograph X-ray (CXR) abnormalities often being misdiagnosed is primarily associated with perceptual errors, where healthcare providers struggle to accurately identify the location of abnormalities, rather than misclassification errors. We currently address this problem through disease-specific segmentation models.

A binary model tends to perform poorly when it encounters a disease that isn't represented in the dataset. We present CheX-nomaly: a binary localization U-net model that leverages transfer learning techniques with the incorporation of an innovative contrastive learning approach. Trained on the VinDr-CXR dataset, which encompasses 14 distinct diseases in addition to 'no finding' cases, my model achieves generalizability across these 14 diseases and others it has not seen before. We show that we can significantly improve",

    "translated_abstract": "胸部X射线（CXR）异常在全球范围内经常被错误诊断，主要与感知错误相关，医疗提供者难以准确识别异常的位置，而不是错误分类。我们目前通过疾病特定的分割模型来解决这个问题。不幸的是，这些模型不能在现场使用，因为它们在胸腔疾病中的推广性较差。当遇到数据集中没有代表的疾病时，二元模型的性能往往较差。我们提出了CheX-nomaly:一种二元定位U-net模型，利用迁移学习技术和创新的对比学习方法。在包含14种不同疾病以及“无发现”病例的VinDr-CXR数据集上进行训练，我的模型在这14种疾病以及其他未见过的疾病中实现了推广性。我们表明我们可以显著改进",
