    "translated_abstract": "为了理解外行星和棕矮星的高精度观测结果，我们需要详细和复杂的涵盖了流体力学、化学和辐射的通用环流模型（GCMs）。本研究具体考察了GCMs中化学和辐射之间的耦合关系，并比较了在相关-k假设中混合不同化学物种透明度的不同方法，在不能假设平衡化学反应的情况下。我们提出了一种基于DeepSets（DS）的快速机器学习方法，有效地结合了各个相关-k透明度表（k-tables）。我们将DS方法与其他已发表的方法如自适应等价消光（AEE）和带有重新分组和排序的随机重叠（RORR）进行了评估。我们将这些混合方法整合到了我们的GCM (expeRT/MITgcm)中，并对热木星HD~209458 b进行了准确性和性能评估。我们的研究结果表明，DS方法在GCM使用时既准确又高效，而RORR方法则不然。",
