    "translated_abstract": "我们提出多模态神经后验估计(MultiNPE)，这是一种利用神经网络在模拟推理中整合来自不同来源的异构数据的方法。受深度融合学习的进展启发，它赋予研究人员分析来自不同领域的数据并推断复杂数学模型参数的能力，提高了准确性。我们针对MultiNPE制定了多模态融合方法（早期、后期、混合），并在三项具有挑战性的实验中评估它们的性能。MultiNPE不仅在参考任务上优于单一数据源基线，还在神经科学和心脏病学的科学模型推理上取得了卓越成绩。我们系统地研究了部分缺失数据对不同融合策略的影响。在我们的实验中，后期和混合融合技术成为多模态模拟推理实际应用的首选方法。",
