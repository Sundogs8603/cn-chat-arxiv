In this work, we propose a novel and general approach that augments an LLM with relevant context from users' interaction histories with a search engine in order to personalize its outputs.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）擅长解决各种自然语言任务。然而，由于重新训练或微调它们所涉及的成本巨大，它们仍然在很大程度上是静态的，并且难以个性化。尽管如此，许多应用程序可以从根据用户的偏好、目标和知识量定制的生成中受益。其中之一是网络搜索，了解用户试图做什么、关心什么以及他们知道什么可以提高搜索体验。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖且通用的方法，该方法使用用户与搜索引擎的交互历史中的相关上下文来增强LLM以个性化其输出。具体而言，我们根据用户在网络上的搜索和浏览活动构建了每个用户的以实体为中心的知识存储，然后利用这些知识为LLM提供具有上下文相关性的提示增强。",
