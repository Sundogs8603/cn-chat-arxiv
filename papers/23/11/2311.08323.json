    "abstract": "arXiv:2311.08323v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: In this project, we demonstrate that phoneme-based models for speech processing can achieve strong crosslinguistic generalizability to unseen languages. We curated the IPAPACK, a massively multilingual speech corpora with phonemic transcriptions, encompassing more than 115 languages from diverse language families, selectively checked by linguists. Based on the IPAPACK, we propose CLAP-IPA, a multi-lingual phoneme-speech contrastive embedding model capable of open-vocabulary matching between arbitrary speech signals and phonemic sequences. The proposed model was tested on 95 unseen languages, showing strong generalizability across languages. Temporal alignments between phonemes and speech signals also emerged from contrastive training, enabling zeroshot forced alignment in unseen languages. We further introduced a neural forced aligner IPA-ALIGNER by finetuning CLAP-IPA with the Forward-Sum loss to learn better phone-to-audio alignmen",

    "translated_abstract": "在这个项目中，我们展示了针对语音处理的基于音素的模型可以在未知语言上实现强大的跨语言泛化能力。我们精心策划了IPAPACK，这是一个包含来自不同语言家族的115多种语言的音素转录的大规模多语言语音语料库，由语言学家进行选择性检查。基于IPAPACK，我们提出了CLAP-IPA，这是一个多语言音素语音对比嵌入模型，能够在任意语音信号和音素序列之间进行开放词汇匹配。所提出的模型在95种未知语言上进行了测试，显示出跨语言具有强大的泛化能力。通过对比训练出现了音素和语音信号之间的时间对齐，使得在未知语言中实现了零-shot强制对齐。我们进一步引入了一个神经强制对齐器IPA-ALIGNER，通过用Forward-Sum损失微调CLAP-IPA来学习更好的音素到音频对齐",
