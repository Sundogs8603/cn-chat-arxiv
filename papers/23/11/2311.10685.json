This \"high-throughput asset pricing\" produces out-of-sample performance comparable to strategies in top finance journals. But unlike the published strategies, the data-mined strategies are free of look-ahead bias. EB predicts that high returns are concentrated in accounting strategies, small stocks, and pre-2004 samples, consistent with limited attention theories. The intuition is seen in the cross-sectional distribution of t-stats, which is far from the null for equal-weighted accounting strategies. High-throughput methods provide a rigorous, unbiased method for documenting asset pricing facts.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们使用经验贝叶斯（EB）挖掘了来自会计比率、过去收益和股票符号构建的14万条多空策略的数据。这种“高通量资产定价”产生的样本外绩效与顶级金融期刊中的策略相当。与已发表的策略不同，数据挖掘的策略免受前瞻性偏见。EB 预测高收益集中在会计策略、小盘股和2004年之前的样本中，与有限注意力理论一致。通过T统计量的横截面分布可以看出这种直觉，对于等权重的会计策略，这个分布与零假设相去甚远。高通量方法提供了一种严格、无偏见的方式，用于记录资产定价事实。",
