    "translated_abstract": "在现代神经科学中，功能磁共振成像（fMRI）是一种至关重要且不可替代的工具，可提供对整个大脑活动动态的非侵入性窗口。然而，fMRI受到血管动力学模糊、高成本、固定不动以及与金属植入物不兼容等限制。脑电图（EEG）与fMRI互补，在高时序分辨率下可以直接记录皮层电活动，但空间分辨率较低，无法恢复有关深层皮层以下结构的信息。从EEG中获取fMRI信息将实现成本效益高，对更广泛的脑区进行成像。此外，跨模态模型还将有助于解释fMRI信号。然而，由于EEG和fMRI都是高维且容易产生伪影的，目前很难从EEG建模fMRI。为了应对这个挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的方法",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种用于预测fMRI信号的新方法，通过利用正弦表示网络从EEG中获取fMRI信息，弥补了两者之间空间分辨率和成本的限制。"
