    "title": "Enhancing Task-Oriented Dialogues with Chitchat: a Comparative Study Based on Lexical Diversity and Divergence. (arXiv:2311.14067v2 [cs.CL] UPDATED)",
    "abstract": "As a recent development, task-oriented dialogues (TODs) have been enriched with chitchat in an effort to make dialogues more diverse and engaging. This enhancement is particularly valuable as TODs are often confined to narrow domains, making the mitigation of repetitive and predictable responses a significant challenge. This paper presents a comparative analysis of three chitchat enhancements, aiming to identify the most effective approach in terms of diversity. Additionally, we quantify the divergence between the added chitchat, the original task-oriented language, and chitchat typically found in chitchat datasets, highlighting the top 20 divergent keywords for each comparison. Our findings drive a discussion on future enhancements for augmenting TODs, emphasizing the importance of grounding dialogues beyond the task to achieve more diverse and natural exchanges.",

    "translated_abstract": "作为最新的发展，为了使对话更加多样化和引人入胜，任务导向对话（TODs）已经与闲聊结合。这种增强对TODs特别有价值，因为TODs通常局限于狭窄的领域，从而使消除重复和可预测的回答成为一项重大挑战。本文通过比较分析了三种闲聊增强方法，并旨在确定在多样性方面最有效的方法。此外，我们量化了添加的闲聊、原始任务导向语言以及典型闲聊数据集中的闲聊之间的差异，并突出了每种比较的前20个差异关键词。我们的研究结果对于讨论未来增强TODs的方法具有指导意义，强调了超越任务范围，实现更加多样化和自然交流的对话的重要性。",
