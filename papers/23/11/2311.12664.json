    "abstract": "We present the DURel tool that implements the annotation of semantic proximity between uses of words into an online, open source interface. The tool supports standardized human annotation as well as computational annotation, building on recent advances with Word-in-Context models. Annotator judgments are clustered with automatic graph clustering techniques and visualized for analysis. This allows to measure word senses with simple and intuitive micro-task judgments between use pairs, requiring minimal preparation efforts. The tool offers additional functionalities to compare the agreement between annotators to guarantee the inter-subjectivity of the obtained judgments and to calculate summary statistics giving insights into sense frequency distributions, semantic variation or changes of senses over time.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了DURel工具，该工具实现了在在线、开源界面中对单词使用之间的语义接近度进行注释。该工具支持标准化的人类注释和计算机注释，利用最近的上下文词模型的进展进行构建。注释者的判断通过自动图形聚类技术进行聚类，并进行可视化分析。这允许通过简单而直观的微任务判断来测量单词词义，并且需要最小的准备工作。该工具提供了额外的功能，以比较注释者之间的一致性，以确保获得判断的主观性，并计算总结统计数据，以揭示词义频率分布、语义变异或词义随时间的变化。",
