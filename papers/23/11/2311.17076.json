    "translated_abstract": "强大的视觉骨干和大规模语言模型(LLM)推理的结合已经导致大型多模态模型(LMM)成为当前广泛视觉和语言(VL)任务的标准。然而，最近的研究表明，即使是最先进的LMM仍然难以捕捉到组合视觉推理方面的细节，比如对象之间的属性和关系。一种解决方案是利用场景图(SGs)——对象及其关系和属性的形式化表达，它已被广泛用作视觉和文本领域之间的桥梁。然而，场景图数据需要场景图注释，这种数据收集成本高昂，因此难以扩展。此外，基于场景图数据微调LMM可能导致预训练目标的灾难性遗忘。为了克服这一问题，受到思维链方法的启发，我们提出了一种新颖的零样式思维提示（CCoT）。",
