Recent research has developed mixed traffic control eco-driving strategies at signalized intersections to decrease emissions.

    "translated_abstract": "自20世纪初以来，温室气体排放量急剧上升，美国交通运输占美国排放量的28%。因此，减少交通相关的排放量成为关注的焦点。特别是，可持续性研究已经在信号化交叉口周围展开，因为交叉口允许不同流量的交通穿过和改变方向。最近的研究已经在信号化交叉口开发了混合交通控制的生态驾驶策略，以减少排放。然而，信号化交叉口的天然结构通过创建频繁的加速/减速事件、交通拥堵引起的过度怠速和起波现象，增加了排放。因此，我们相信非信号化交叉口具有进一步改善可持续性的潜力。在这项工作中，我们对具有复杂的现实世界拓扑和交通需求的非信号化交叉口进行了排放分析，采用了混合交通控制策略。",
