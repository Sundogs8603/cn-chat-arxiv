    "abstract": "arXiv:2311.10928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: In this paper, we introduce CAMRA (Copilot for AMR Annotatations), a cutting-edge web-based tool designed for constructing Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) from natural language text. CAMRA offers a novel approach to deep lexical semantics annotation such as AMR, treating AMR annotation akin to coding in programming languages. Leveraging the familiarity of programming paradigms, CAMRA encompasses all essential features of existing AMR editors, including example lookup, while going a step further by integrating Propbank roleset lookup as an autocomplete feature within the tool. Notably, CAMRA incorporates AMR parser models as coding co-pilots, greatly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of AMR annotators. To demonstrate the tool's capabilities, we provide a live demo accessible at: https://camra.colorado.edu",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们介绍了CAMRA（Copilot for AMR Annotations），这是一个最先进的基于web的工具，旨在从自然语言文本构建抽象意义表示（AMR）。CAMRA提供了一种创新的深层词汇语义注释方法，如AMR，将AMR注释视为编程语言中的编码。借助编程范式的熟悉度，CAMRA包含了所有现有AMR编辑器的基本功能，包括示例查找，同时通过将Propbank角色集查找集成为工具中的自动完成功能，更进一步。值得注意的是，CAMRA将AMR解析器模型作为编码副驾驶，极大地提高了AMR注释者的效率和准确性。为了展示工具的功能，我们提供了一个可访问的实时演示：https://camra.colorado.edu",
