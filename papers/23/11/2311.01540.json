    "abstract": "while most of the tactile robots are operated in close-set conditions, it is challenging for them to operate in open-set conditions where test objects are beyond the robots' knowledge. We proposed an open-set recognition framework using mechanical properties to recongise known objects and incrementally label novel objects. The main contribution is a clustering algorithm that exploits knowledge of known objects to estimate cluster centre and sizes, unlike a typical algorithm that randomly selects them. The framework is validated with the mechanical properties estimated from a real object during interaction. The results show that the framework could recognise objects better than alternative methods contributed by the novelty detector. Importantly, our clustering algorithm yields better clustering performance than other methods. Furthermore, the hyperparameters studies show that cluster size is important to clustering results and needed to be tuned properly.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管大多数触觉机器人在封闭集条件下运行，但它们在超出机器人知识范围的开放条件下操作是具有挑战性的。我们提出了一个使用机械性能进行开放式识别的框架，以识别已知对象并逐步标记新对象。其主要贡献是利用已知对象的知识来估计聚类中心和大小的聚类算法，而不是像传统算法那样随机选择。该框架通过与实际对象的交互中估计的机械性能进行验证。结果显示，与由新颖性检测器贡献的替代方法相比，该框架能更好地识别对象。重要的是，我们的聚类算法比其他方法具有更好的聚类性能。此外，超参数研究显示，聚类结果与聚类大小密切相关，需要适当进行调整。",
