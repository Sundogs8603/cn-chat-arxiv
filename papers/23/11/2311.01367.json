    "abstract": "In this study, we present a non-contact respiratory anomaly detection method using incoherent light-wave signals reflected from the chest of a mechanical robot that can breathe like human beings. In comparison to existing radar and camera-based sensing systems for vitals monitoring, this technology uses only a low-cost ubiquitous light source (e.g., infrared light emitting diode) and sensor (e.g., photodetector). This light-wave sensing (LWS) system recognizes different breathing anomalies from the variations of light intensity reflected from the chest of the robot within a 0.5m-1.5m range. The anomaly detection model demonstrates up to 96.6% average accuracy in classifying 7 different types of breathing data using machine learning. The model can also detect faulty data collected by the system that does not contain breathing information. The developed system can be utilized at home or healthcare facilities as a smart, non-contact and discreet respiration monitoring method.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项研究中，我们提出了一种利用机械机器人胸部反射的非相干光波信号进行非接触呼吸异常检测的方法。与现有的雷达和摄像头感应系统相比，这项技术只使用了低成本的普遍光源（如红外发光二极管）和传感器（如光电检测器）。这个光波感应（LWS）系统通过测量机器人胸部反射的光强变化来识别不同的呼吸异常，在0.5米至1.5米范围内。该异常检测模型使用机器学习能够以96.6%的平均准确率分类7种不同类型的呼吸数据。该模型还可以检测到系统收集的不包含呼吸信息的错误数据。开发的系统可以作为智能、非接触和隐蔽的呼吸监测方法，在家庭或医疗机构中使用。",
