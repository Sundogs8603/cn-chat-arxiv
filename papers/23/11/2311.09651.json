    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Bard have garnered significant attention in the academic community. Previous research has evaluated these LLMs for various applications such as generating programming exercises and solutions. However, these evaluations have predominantly been conducted by instructors and researchers, not considering the actual usage of LLMs by students. This study adopts a student-first approach to comprehensively understand how undergraduate computer science students utilize ChatGPT, a popular LLM, released by OpenAI. We employ a combination of student surveys and interviews to obtain valuable insights into the benefits, challenges, and suggested improvements related to ChatGPT. Our findings suggest that a majority of students (over 57%) have a convincingly positive outlook towards adopting ChatGPT as an aid in coursework-related tasks. However, our research also highlights various challenges that must be resolved for long-term acceptance of Chat",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）如ChatGPT和Google Bard在学术界引起了广泛关注。先前的研究已评估了这些LLM在生成编程练习和解决方案等各种应用方面的表现。然而，这些评估主要由教师和研究人员进行，并未考虑到学生对LLM的实际使用情况。本研究采用以学生为中心的方法，全面了解本科计算机科学学生如何利用OpenAI发布的热门LLM ChatGPT。我们通过学生调查和访谈相结合的方式获取有价值的洞察，了解与ChatGPT相关的好处、挑战和改进建议。我们的研究结果表明，大多数学生（超过57%）对将ChatGPT作为课程相关任务的辅助工具持有积极的态度。然而，我们的研究也强调了必须解决的各种挑战，以实现对ChatGPT的长期接受。",
