    "translated_abstract": "现实世界中的数据集不可避免地包含由数据收集过程中不同来源或条件引起的偏差。因此，这种不一致性本身作为混淆因素干扰了聚类分析。现有方法通过在聚类之前将数据投影到与混淆因素扩展的正交补空间上来消除偏差。在这种方法中，聚类因素和混淆因素在原始特征空间中被粗略地考虑，理想情况下假设数据与混淆因素之间的相关性是线性的，以方便求解。然而，这些方法的适用范围有限，因为在实际应用中的数据通常与混淆因素呈复杂的非线性相关。本文提出了一个名为“Sanitized Clustering Against confounding Bias (SCAB)”的新的聚类框架，通过非线性依赖度在复杂数据的语义潜空间中去除混淆因素。",
