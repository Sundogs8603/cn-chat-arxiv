Constructed using the React framework, this system presents users with an elegant and user-friendly interface. It enables users to input a news article and select from a choice of two models to generate a comprehensive list of relations within the provided text. As a result, RENA allows real-time parsing of news articles to extract key information for epidemic surveillance, contributing to EPIWATCH, an open-source intelligence-based epidemic warning system.",
