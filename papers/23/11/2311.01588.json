    "translated_abstract": "研究表明，与依赖于摘要统计量（如功率谱）的方法相比，深度学习模型在从复杂宇宙学数据集中提取信息方面表现更好。然而，由于不同模拟套件中的子网格物理实现和数值逼近的差异，模型在一个宇宙学模拟的数据上训练后，在另一个模拟数据上的表现会下降。同样，对于任何模拟数据训练的模型，在应用于观测数据时也可能出现性能下降。通过在两个不同套件的CAMELS水动力宇宙学模拟数据上进行训练，我们研究了领域适应图神经网络（DA-GNNs）的泛化能力。通过利用GNNs，我们可以利用它们捕捉来自星系分布的结构无标度宇宙学信息的能力。此外，通过包括无监督的领域适配最大均值差异（MMD），我们使模型能够自适应地学习两个模拟数据之间的差异。",
