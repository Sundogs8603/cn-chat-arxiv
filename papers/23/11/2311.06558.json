    "translated_abstract": "量化评估数据样本之间的差异和/或相似性定义和塑造了与学习数据分布相关的优化问题。目前的比较数据方法常常在捕捉这种分布方面存在局限性，或者缺乏优化所需的良好数学属性（如平滑性、可微性或凸性）。在本文中，我们引入了一种受Wiener滤波器理论启示的新方法，用于度量成对样本之间的(不)相似性。Wiener滤波器的卷积性质使我们能够全面地以全局相关的方式比较数据样本。我们在四个机器学习应用中验证了我们的方法：数据压缩、医学图像填充、翻译分类和非参数生成模型。我们的结果表明，与传统的均方误差相比，在重构图像方面具有更高的感知质量和数据保真度，并且对平移具有更好的鲁棒性。",
