    "abstract": "We analyze the structure of the market for foundation models, i.e., large AI models such as those that power ChatGPT and that are adaptable to downstream uses, and we examine the implications for competition policy and regulation. We observe that the most capable models will have a tendency towards natural monopoly and may have potentially vast markets. This calls for a two-pronged regulatory response: (i) Antitrust authorities need to ensure the contestability of the market by tackling strategic behavior, in particular by ensuring that monopolies do not propagate vertically to downstream uses, and (ii) given the diminished potential for market discipline, there is a role for regulators to ensure that the most capable models meet sufficient quality standards (including safety, privacy, non-discrimination, reliability and interoperability standards) to maximally contribute to social welfare. Regulators should also ensure a level regulatory playing field between AI and non-AI application",

    "translated_abstract": "我们分析了基础模型市场的结构，即那些驱动ChatGPT等应用并适用于下游用途的大型AI模型，并研究了其对竞争政策和监管的影响。我们观察到，能力最强的模型有一种向自然垄断的趋势，并且可能面对广阔的市场。这需要双管齐下的监管响应：（一）反垄断机构需要通过解决战略行为，特别是确保垄断不会垂直传播到下游用途，来确保市场的可竞争性；（二）考虑到市场约束的降低，监管机构应确保最具能力的模型符合足够的质量标准（包括安全、隐私、非歧视、可靠性和互操作性标准），以最大程度地对社会福利做出贡献。监管机构还应确保AI和非AI应用之间有一个公平的监管环境。",
