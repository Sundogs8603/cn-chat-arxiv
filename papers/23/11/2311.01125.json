    "translated_abstract": "基于会话的推荐旨在基于匿名行为序列预测下一个购买的物品。许多经济研究表明，物品价格是影响用户购买决策的关键因素。然而，现有的基于会话的推荐方法只关注捕捉用户的兴趣偏好，忽略了用户的价格偏好。实际上，有两个主要的挑战阻碍我们获取价格偏好。首先，价格偏好与各种物品特征（即类别和品牌）密切相关，这要求我们从异构信息中挖掘价格偏好。其次，价格偏好和兴趣偏好是相互依赖的，共同决定用户的选择，这要求我们同时考虑价格和兴趣偏好进行意图建模。为了应对上述挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的基于会话的推荐方法——双偏好学习异构超图网络（BiPNet）。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文提出了一种双偏好学习异构超图网络（BiPNet）的方法来解决基于会话的推荐中的价格偏好问题。这个方法考虑了价格偏好与兴趣偏好的互相影响，从而提高了推荐的准确性和个性化程度。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method called Bi-Preference Learning Heterogeneous Hypergraph Networks (BiPNet) to address the issue of price preference in session-based recommendation. The method considers the interdependence between price preference and interest preference, thereby improving the accuracy and personalization of recommendations."
