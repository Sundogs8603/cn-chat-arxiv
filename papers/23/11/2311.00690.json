    "translated_abstract": "对视觉分析过程的理解可以从多个方面受益于可视化研究人员，包括改进可视化设计和开发先进的交互功能。然而，由于感知的复杂性和我们对相关用户行为的缺乏了解，用户行为的日志文件仍然难以分析。本文提出了一个关于用户行为的全面数据采集的研究，并结合时间序列分类方法进行分析。我们选择了一个经典的可视化应用，Covid-19数据分析，涵盖地理空间、时间序列和多属性的常见分析任务。我们的用户研究收集了关于多个可视化任务的用户行为，使用了两个可比较的系统，桌面和沉浸式可视化。我们总结了两个尺度上使用三种时间序列机器学习算法的分类结果，并探索了行为特征的影响。我们的结果揭示了用户行为的差异。",
