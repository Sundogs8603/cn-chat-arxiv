    "translated_abstract": "想象一下，在公园里可以听到鸟儿在鸣叫，而不会听到其他徒步者的聒噪声；或者在繁忙的街道上可以屏蔽交通噪音，同时仍然能听到紧急警笛和汽车鸣笛声。我们介绍了语义听力，这是一种新颖的听觉设备功能，能够实时地关注或忽略真实环境中特定的声音，同时保留空间线索。为了实现这一目标，我们做出了两个技术贡献：1）我们提出了第一个能够在干扰声和背景噪音存在的情况下实现双耳目标声音提取的神经网络，2）我们设计了一种训练方法，使我们的系统能够推广到实际的使用场景。结果显示，我们的系统可以处理20个声音类别，并且我们基于Transformer的网络在连接的智能手机上的运行时间为6.56毫秒。在未知的室内外场景中的“野外”评估中，参与者的测试显示我们的系统表现良好。",
