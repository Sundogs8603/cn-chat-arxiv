    "translated_abstract": "从计算机视觉任务的早期成功开始，基于深度学习的技术已经超过了各个领域中的最先进方法。然而，已经多次证明这些技术无法捕捉语义上下文和逻辑约束，而是常常依赖于虚假的相关性来得出答案。由于深度学习技术在关键场景中的应用依赖于遵守特定领域的约束条件，因此已经进行了多次尝试来解决这个问题。一个限制深入研究的问题是缺乏具有丰富规则集的合适数据集。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了VALUE（视觉和逻辑理解评估）数据集，包含20万多个带注释的图像和一个基于流行的棋盘游戏—象棋的规则集。经过精心策划的规则集极大地限制了可接受的预测范围，并旨在探索关键的语义和逻辑理解挑战。",
