Despite the ability to generate high-quality images, these models often replicate elements from their training data, leading to increasing copyright concerns in real applications in recent years. In response to this raising concern about copyright infringement, recent studies have studied the copyright behavior of diffusion models when using direct, copyrighted prompts. Our research extends this by examining subtler forms of infringement, where even indirect prompts can trigger copyright issues. Specifically, we introduce a data generation pipeline to systematically produce data for studying copyright in diffusion models. Our pipeline enables us to investigate copyright infringement in a more practical setting, involving replicating visual features rather than entire works",

    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型在许多生成建模任务中表现出色，特别是在从文本提示中创建图像的任务中表现出色，这个任务被称为文本到图像（T2I）生成。尽管这些模型能够生成高质量的图像，但它们经常复制训练数据中的元素，导致近年来实际应用中版权担忧不断增加。为了回应关于版权侵权的担忧增加，最近的研究已经研究了在使用直接有版权的提示时扩散模型的版权行为。我们的研究通过检查更微妙的侵权形式扩展了这一点，即即使是间接的提示也可能引发版权问题。具体地，我们引入了一个数据生成管道，以系统地产生用于研究扩散模型中版权问题的数据。我们的管道使我们能够在更实际的环境中调查版权侵权，涉及复制视觉特征而不是整个作品。",
