    "translated_abstract": "语言错乱，如充满停顿或重复，是语音中典型流畅度的中断。口吃是一种以高频率出现语言错乱的言语障碍，但所有人说话时都会出现一些语言错乱，而语言错乱的频率可能因认知负荷等因素而增加。在临床上，自动检测错误的语言可能有助于为口吃者制定治疗计划。在临床外，自动检测错误的语言可能作为预处理步骤，以改善后续应用中的自然语言理解。考虑到这个广泛的应用范围，我们研究了基于语言、声学和多模态方法的逐帧自动检测和分类语言错乱。这些方法都以音频作为输入。首先，我们评估了几种自动语音识别（ASR）系统在转录错误的能力方面，使用错误率来衡量语言错乱的转录能力。然后，我们使用这些ASR转录结果作为输入，...",
