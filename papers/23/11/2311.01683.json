    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）被越来越多地用于量化化学交换饱和转移（CEST）效应。ML模型通常使用实测数据或完全模拟数据进行训练。然而，使用实测数据进行训练往往缺乏足够的训练数据，而使用完全模拟数据进行训练可能由于有限的模拟资源而引入偏差。本研究引入了一个新平台，将模拟数据和实测数据结合起来生成部分合成的CEST数据，并评估其用于训练ML模型预测酰胺质子转移（APT）效应的可行性。部分合成的CEST信号使用从模拟中的APT效应的逆求和和来自实测数据的其他成分创建。通过改变APT模拟参数并应用缩放因子来调整实测数据的成分，生成了训练数据，实现了模拟的灵活性和准确性之间的平衡。",
