    "translated_abstract": "传统的语音到文本翻译系统是在单个说话者的语音上进行训练的，可能无法适应实际情况下包含多个说话者对话的场景。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为Speaker-Turn Aware Conversational Speech Translation的端到端和多任务训练模型，通过使用特殊标记的序列化标签格式来结合自动语音识别、语音翻译和说话者转换检测。我们在Fisher-CALLHOME语料库上进行了实验，通过将两个单一说话者通道合并为一个多说话者通道，表示更真实和具有挑战性的多说话者转换和交叉对话场景。实验结果在单说话者和多说话者条件下，并与传统的语音到文本翻译系统进行比较，表明我们的模型在多说话者条件下优于参考系统，并取得了可比较的性能。",
