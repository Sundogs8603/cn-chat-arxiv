    "translated_abstract": "人口老龄化是一个全球性的挑战，导致对老年人的医疗和社会服务需求增加。家庭保健护理（HHC）作为一种专门为这一人群提供服务的重要解决方案正逐渐兴起。鉴于对HHC的需求激增，有效地协调和管理护理员的分配至关重要，这对于预算优化的规划和确保提供高质量的护理至关重要。本研究回答了家庭保健机构面临的一个关键问题：“在护理员偏好灵活的访问顺序的情况下，如何优化他们的分配？”之前的研究提出了刚性的访问顺序，而我们的研究引入了一种决策支持框架，通过一种混合方法对护理员进行分配，考虑了访问顺序的灵活性，旨在减少行驶里程、增加每个规划周期的访问次数，并保持连续护理-这是衡量患者情况的关键指标。",
