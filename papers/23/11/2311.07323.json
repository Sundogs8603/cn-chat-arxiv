    "translated_abstract": "典型分类任务中最先进的结果通常由无法解释的机器学习方法（如深度神经网络）实现。相反，在本文中，我们研究了规则学习方法在这样的情境下的应用。因此，分类基于可理解（一阶）规则，这些规则解释了所作出的预测。总的来说，然而，基于规则的分类远不如最先进的结果准确（通常显著）。作为主要贡献，我们引入了一种结合了两个领域的投票方法，旨在实现与（无法解释的）最先进方法可比较的结果，同时仍以确定性规则的形式提供解释。考虑到包括对保险业具有重要意义的使用案例在内的各种基准数据集，我们证明了我们的方法不仅明显优于普通的规则学习方法，而且在实践中取得了结果",
