With extremely limited interactions of cold-start users, conventional recommender models often struggle to generate embeddings with sufficient expressivity.

To address this issue, our motivation is based on the observation that if a model can generate expressive embeddings for existing users with relatively more interactions, who were also initially cold-start users, then we can establish a mapping from few initial interactions to expressive embeddings, simulating the process of generating embeddings for cold-start users. Based on this motivation, we propose a Variational Mapping approach for cold-start user Recommendation (VM-Rec). Firstly, we generate a personalized mapping function for cold-start users based on their initial interactions, and parameters ",

    "translated_abstract": "冷启动问题是大多数推荐系统面临的共同挑战。传统的推荐模型在冷启动用户的互动非常有限时通常难以生成具有足够表达能力的嵌入。此外，缺乏用户的辅助内容信息加剧了挑战的存在，使得大多数冷启动方法难以应用。为了解决这个问题，我们观察到，如果模型能够为相对更多互动的现有用户生成具有表达能力的嵌入，这些用户最初也是冷启动用户，那么我们可以建立一个从少量初始互动到具有表达能力的嵌入的映射，模拟为冷启动用户生成嵌入的过程。基于这个观察，我们提出了一种变分映射方法用于冷启动用户推荐（VM-Rec）。首先，我们根据冷启动用户的初始互动生成个性化的映射函数，并进行参数优化。",
