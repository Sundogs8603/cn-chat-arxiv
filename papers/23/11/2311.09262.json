    "translated_abstract": "论文的潜在影响受到多种因素的影响，包括其流行度和贡献。现有模型通常基于静态图来估计原始引用计数，未能从细微的角度区分价值。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的图神经网络，用于将论文的潜在影响分解为传播、一致性和贡献值（称为DPPDCC）。给定一个目标论文，DPPDCC在构建的动态异构图中编码了时态和结构特征。特别地，为了捕捉知识流动，我们强调了论文之间的比较和共引/被引信息的重要性，并进行了快照演化的聚合。为了揭示流行度，我们通过对比增强图来提取传播的本质，并预测累积的引用分组以建模一致性。我们进一步应用正交约束来鼓励每个角度的独特建模，并保留其固有获得的信息。",
