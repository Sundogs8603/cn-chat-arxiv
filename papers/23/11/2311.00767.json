    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了依靠通过RGB-Depth传感器记录的抽象化的“骨骼”数据的手势分类器。我们关注Praxis数据集中由身体关节坐标表示的“骨骼”数据。Praxis数据集包含了患有大脑皮层病理（如阿尔茨海默病）的患者在临床医师指导下进行Praxis测试的记录。本文提出的手势分类器在Praxis数据集上比之前提出的模型更有效。身体关节数据提供了一种可以专门用于手势识别的压缩数据形式。通过使用窗口技术与循环神经网络（RNN）等深度学习架构的结合，我们仅使用身体关节数据就达到了70.8%的整体准确率。此外，我们还研究了一种长短时记忆（LSTM）方法，以提取和分析关节的运动特征以识别正在执行的手势。",
