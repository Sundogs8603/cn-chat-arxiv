By employing imaging techniques, e.g., multispectral imaging, it becomes possible to identify features that are imperceptible to the naked eye, including faded and erased inks.

In this work, we propose deep learning-based semantic segmentation as a method for identifying and segmenting individual letters in overlapping characters. The experiment was conceived as a proof of concept, focusing on the palimpsests of the Ars Grammatica by Prisciano as a case study.

    "translated_abstract": "Palimpsests是指历史手稿中被第二个写作部分覆盖的已经擦除的写作。通过使用成像技术，如多光谱成像，可以识别出肉眼难以察觉的特征，包括褪色和擦除的墨迹。当处理重叠墨迹时，可以利用人工智能技术来解开重叠字母的复杂节点。在这项工作中，我们提出了基于深度学习的语义分割作为一种识别和分割重叠字符中的个体字母的方法。该实验被构想为一个概念验证，以普里西亚诺的《语法文献》作为案例研究。此外，我们还讨论了结合多光谱成像的方法的限制和前景。",
