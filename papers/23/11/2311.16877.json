    "abstract": "Missing data is a common problem in practical settings. Various imputation methods have been developed to deal with missing data. However, even though the label is usually available in the training data, the common practice of imputation usually only relies on the input and ignores the label. In this work, we illustrate how stacking the label into the input can significantly improve the imputation of the input. In addition, we propose a classification strategy that initializes the predicted test label with missing values and stacks the label with the input for imputation. This allows imputing the label and the input at the same time. Also, the technique is capable of handling data training with missing labels without any prior imputation and is applicable to continuous, categorical, or mixed-type data. Experiments show promising results in terms of accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "在实际应用中，缺失数据是一个常见的问题。已经开发了各种填充方法来处理缺失数据。然而，尽管训练数据通常都有标签，但常见的填充方法通常只依赖于输入而忽略标签。在这项工作中，我们阐述了将标签堆叠到输入中可以显着提高输入的填充效果。此外，我们提出了一种分类策略，该策略将预测的测试标签初始化为缺失值，并将标签与输入堆叠在一起进行填充。这样可以同时填充标签和输入。而且，该技术能够处理具有缺失标签的训练数据，无需任何先前的填充，并且适用于连续型、分类型或混合型数据。实验证明在准确性方面取得了有希望的结果。",
