    "translated_abstract": "许多现实世界的实验设计问题在并行评估多个实验条件的同时，由于存在大量和异方差的观测噪声，还会对每个条件进行多次复制。在给定固定总预算的情况下，这自然地引发了在评估更多唯一条件的同时减少每个条件的复制次数与评估较少的唯一条件并增加每个条件的复制次数之间的权衡。此外，在这些问题中，从业人员可能具有风险规避倾向，因此更加偏好既具有良好平均性能又具有较小变异性的输入。为了解决这两个挑战，我们提出了适用于可复制实验设计的批量 Thompson Sampling (BTS-RED) 框架，其中包括三个算法。我们的 BTS-RED-Known 和 BTS-RED-Unknown 算法分别用于已知和未知噪声方差，通过自适应选择复制次数而不是确定性地为具有较大噪声方差的输入进行更多次复制。因此，尽管输入的噪声方差较大，我们的方法仍能实现复制更多次的效果。",
