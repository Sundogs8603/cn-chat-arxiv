    "abstract": "This article introduces SAGE (Smart home Agent with Grounded Execution), a framework designed to maximize the flexibility of smart home assistants by replacing manually-defined inference logic with an LLM-powered autonomous agent system. SAGE integrates information about user preferences, device states, and external factors (such as weather and TV schedules) through the orchestration of a collection of tools. SAGE's capabilities include learning user preferences from natural-language utterances, interacting with devices by reading their API documentation, writing code to continuously monitor devices, and understanding natural device references. To evaluate SAGE, we develop a benchmark of 43 highly challenging smart home tasks, where SAGE successfully achieves 23 tasks, significantly outperforming existing LLM-enabled baselines (5/43).",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了SAGE（具有基于实际执行的智能家居助手）框架，该框架通过将手动定义的推理逻辑替换为LLM驱动的自主代理系统，以最大程度地提高智能家居助手的灵活性。SAGE通过协调一系列工具整合用户偏好、设备状态和外部因素（如天气和电视节目表）。SAGE的功能包括从自然语言表达中学习用户偏好，通过阅读设备的API文档与设备交互，编写代码以持续监视设备，并理解自然的设备引用。为了评估SAGE，我们开发了一个包含43个高度挑战的智能家居任务的基准，SAGE成功完成了23个任务，显著优于现有的LLM基准（5/43）。",
