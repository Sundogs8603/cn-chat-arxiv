    "abstract": "I analyze the risk-coping behaviors among factory worker households in early 20th-century Tokyo. I digitize a unique daily longitudinal survey dataset on household budgets to examine the extent to which consumption is affected by idiosyncratic shocks. I find that while the households were so vulnerable that the shocks impacted their consumption levels, the income elasticity for food consumption is relatively low in the short-run perspective. The result from mechanism analysis suggests that credit purchases played a role in smoothing the short-run food consumption. The event-study analysis using the adverse health shock as the idiosyncratic income shock confirms the robustness of the results. I also find evidence that the misassignment of payday in data aggregation results in a systematic attenuation bias due to measurement error.",

    "translated_abstract": "我分析了20世纪初东京的工厂工人家庭中的风险应对行为。我数字化了一份关于家庭预算的独特的日常纵向调查数据集，以考察个体冲击对消费的影响程度。我发现，尽管家庭非常脆弱，冲击影响了他们的消费水平，但食品消费的收入弹性在短期内相对较低。机制分析的结果表明，信用购买在平滑短期食品消费方面起到了一定作用。使用不良健康冲击作为个体收入冲击的事件研究分析证实了结果的稳健性。我还发现证据表明，在数据聚合中工资支付日期的错误分配导致了由于测量误差而出现系统性的减少偏差。",
