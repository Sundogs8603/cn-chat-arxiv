Specifically, we first employ a user constant viewing flow modeling method to summarize the user's general interest to recommend articles. In this case, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to capture constant user preferences from previously clicked articles, such as skills and positions. Then we design the user instant viewing flow modeling method to build interactions between user-clicked article history and candidate articles. It attentively reads the representations of user-clicked articles and aims to learn the user's different interest views to match the candidate article. Our experimental results on the Alibaba Technology Association (ATA) website show the advantage of SINGLE, achieving a 2.4% improvement over previous baseli",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了用户浏览流建模（SINGLE）方法用于文章推荐任务，该方法从用户点击的文章中模拟用户的持续偏好和即时兴趣。具体而言，我们首先采用用户持续浏览流建模方法总结用户的一般兴趣以推荐文章。在这种情况下，我们利用大型语言模型（LLMs）从先前点击的文章中捕捉用户的持续偏好，如技能和职位。然后我们设计用户即时浏览流建模方法来构建用户点击的文章历史与候选文章之间的交互。它专注于阅读用户点击文章的表示，并旨在学习用户不同的兴趣观点以匹配候选文章。我们在阿里巴巴技术协会（ATA）网站上的实验结果显示SINGLE的优势，相较于先前的基线实现了2.4%的改进。",
