    "translated_abstract": "生物医学信息图对于现代生物医学领域中的生物医学信息相互作用的发现至关重要，比如多样化分子相互作用的识别和药物发现，在生物医学、生物信息学和人类健康社区中引起了越来越多的关注。目前，越来越多的图神经网络被提出来学习生物医学信息实体，并通过最先进的结果准确揭示生物医学分子相互作用。然而，这些方法虽然弥补了远距离特征的衰减，但却以冗余的内存和时间为代价。在我们的论文中，我们提出了一种新颖的Residual Message Graph Convolution Network（ResMGCN），用于以一种不同的思路快速而准确地预测生物医学相互作用。具体来说，ResMGCN不是增强远程节点的消息，而是与下一轮高阶信息相结合。",
