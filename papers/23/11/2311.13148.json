    "translated_abstract": "基础模型，如大型语言模型（LLM），由于其理解和生成内容的能力，包括具有推理能力的计划，已被广泛认可为具有变革性的AI技术。基于基础模型的代理从基础模型的能力中获得自主性，这使它们能够自主将给定的目标分解为一组可管理的任务，并编排任务执行以实现目标。尽管在构建基于基础模型的代理方面付出了巨大努力，但代理的体系结构设计尚未得到系统地探索。此外，虽然使用代理进行规划和执行有着重大好处，但有关负责任AI相关软件质量属性（如安全性和问责制）存在严重考虑。因此，本文提出了一种以模式为导向的参考架构，可用作在设计基于基础模型代理时的指导。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文提出了一种基于模式的参考架构，为设计基于基础模型代理时提供指导，强调了负责任AI和软件质量属性等方面的重要性。",
