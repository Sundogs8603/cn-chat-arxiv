    "translated_abstract": "近年来，一些作者一直在研究单纯模型，这是基于称为单纯复合体的高维结构的认知逻辑模型。在最初的形式中，单纯模型始终被假设为纯粹的，意味着所有世界具有相同的维度。这相当于基于克里普克模型的标准S5n语义的认知逻辑。通过移除模型必须是纯粹的假设，我们可以超越常规的克里普克语义，并研究参与一个世界的代理数量可以变化的认知逻辑。这种方法已在许多论文中得到应用，其中应用于容错分布式计算，其中在系统执行期间可能会发生过程崩溃。一个问题是，在定义不纯的单纯模型时，微妙的设计选择可能会导致所得到的逻辑的不同公理。在本文中，我们系统地对这些设计选择进行分类，并公理化相应的认知逻辑。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了故障代理的认知逻辑，并提出了基于单纯模型的新模型，该模型允许世界中参与的代理数量可以变化。这对于容错分布式计算非常有用。"
