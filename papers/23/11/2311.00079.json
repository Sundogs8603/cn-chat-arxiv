    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在各个领域表现出色，但它们对虚假特征的依赖引发了人们对其可靠性的担忧。解决这个问题的一种有希望的方法是最后一层的重新训练，即在没有虚假线索的小数据子集上重新训练线性分类器头部。然而，选择此子集需要人工监督，降低了其可扩展性。此外，选定子集中可能仍存在虚假线索。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的排名框架，利用开放词汇的目标检测技术来识别没有虚假线索的图像。具体而言，我们使用目标检测器作为对图像中目标物体存在的量化指标。然后，根据这个得分对图像进行排序，并在得分最高的数据子集上重新训练模型的最后一层。我们在ImageNet-1k数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。",
