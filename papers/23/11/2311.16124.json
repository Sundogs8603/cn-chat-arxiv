    "translated_abstract": "基于扩散的净化防御利用扩散模型消除对抗示例的制造扰动，并实现了最先进的鲁棒性。最近的研究表明，即使是先进的攻击也无法有效地破坏这种防御，因为净化过程引发了一个极其深层的计算图，可能导致梯度模糊、高内存消耗和无限的随机性问题。在本文中，我们提出了一个统一的框架DiffAttack来对基于扩散的净化防御执行有效和高效的攻击，包括DDPM和基于分数的方法。具体来说，我们在中间的扩散步骤中提出了一个偏差重构损失，以引起不准确的密度梯度估计，以解决梯度消失/爆炸的问题。我们还提供了一种分段式前向后向算法，可以实现高效的梯度反向传播。我们通过与其他攻击方法进行比较验证了DiffAttack的攻击效果。",
