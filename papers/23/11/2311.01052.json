    "abstract": "We introduce Resilient Multiple Choice Learning (rMCL), an extension of the MCL approach for conditional distribution estimation in regression settings where multiple targets may be sampled for each training input. Multiple Choice Learning is a simple framework to tackle multimodal density estimation, using the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss for a set of hypotheses. In regression settings, the existing MCL variants focus on merging the hypotheses, thereby eventually sacrificing the diversity of the predictions. In contrast, our method relies on a novel learned scoring scheme underpinned by a mathematical framework based on Voronoi tessellations of the output space, from which we can derive a probabilistic interpretation. After empirically validating rMCL with experiments on synthetic data, we further assess its merits on the sound source localization problem, demonstrating its practical usefulness and the relevance of its interpretation.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了韧性多选学习（rMCL），这是一种对于每个训练输入可能采样多个目标的回归设置下条件分布估计的MCL方法的扩展。多选学习是一个简单的框架，用于处理多模态密度估计，使用了一组假设的胜者全拿（WTA）损失。在回归设置中，现有的MCL变体主要集中在合并假设上，从而最终牺牲了预测的多样性。相反，我们的方法依赖于一个基于Voronoi tessellations的输出空间的数学框架支持的新颖的学习评分方案，我们可以从中得出概率解释。在对合成数据进行实证验证后，我们进一步评估了rMCL在声源定位问题上的优点，展示了其实际的有用性和解释的相关性。",
