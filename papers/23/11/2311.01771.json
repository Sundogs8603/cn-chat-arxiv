    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在构建一种新颖的赌博算法，能够充分利用多维数据和奖励函数的固有非线性特性，提供高可用和负责任的决策服务。为此，我们引入了一种广义低秩张量情境赌博模型，其中一个动作由三个特征向量组成，因此可以用张量表示。在这个模型中，奖励是通过将动作的特征张量与一个固定但未知的参数张量的内积应用于广义线性函数来确定的，而这个参数张量具有较低的管状秩。为了实现探索和利用之间的权衡，我们引入了一种名为“广义低秩张量探索子空间然后细化”的新算法（G-LowTESTR）。该算法首先收集原始数据，以探索嵌入在决策情境中的本质低秩张量子空间信息，然后将原始概率转换为可解释的结构化概率。",
