    "translated_abstract": "高并行工作负载，如机器学习训练、推断和一般HPC任务，通过使用GPU设备得到了极大的加速。在云计算集群中，通过多任务共享来提供GPU的计算能力是非常需要的，因为总是有更多的任务请求而不是可用的GPU数量。现有的GPU共享解决方案着重于减少多个作业争夺单个GPU时的任务级等待时间或任务级切换成本。连续计算请求具有不同的优先级，对于共享GPU设备，对QoS产生了非对称的影响。现有工作没有充分利用这种情况带来的内核级优化机会。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的内核级调度策略FIKIT：填充内核间空闲时间。FIKIT包含任务级优先级信息、细粒度内核识别和内核测量，允许低优先级任务在高优先级任务的内核间执行。",
