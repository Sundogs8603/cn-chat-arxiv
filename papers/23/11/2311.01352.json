    "translated_abstract": "随着现代显微镜和生物成像技术的快速发展，产生了大量的显微图像数据，这些数据通过网络进行存储、分析甚至共享。数据的规模对当前的数据基础设施提出了巨大挑战。减小数据尺寸的一种常见方法是图像压缩。本研究分析了经典的和基于深度学习的图像压缩方法，并研究了它们对基于深度学习的图像处理模型的影响。基于深度学习的无标签预测模型（即从亮场图像预测荧光图像）被用作比较和分析的示例应用。有效的图像压缩方法可以在不丢失必要信息的情况下显著减小数据尺寸，从而减轻数据管理基础设施的负担，并实现数据共享或云计算下的快速传输。为了以这样的方式压缩图像，多种经典的丢失压缩方法和基于深度学习的无损压缩方法得到了评估。",
