However, the human's intent in turn depends on actions the robot takes, creating a chicken-or-egg problem. Prior methods ignore such inter-dependency and instead train marginal intent prediction models independent of robot actions. This is because training conditional models is hard given a lack of paired human-robot interaction datasets. Can we instead leverage large-scale human-human interaction data that is more easily accessible? Our key insight is to exploit a correspondence between human and robot actions that enables transfer learning from human-human to human-robot data. We propose a novel architecture, InteRACT, that pre-trains a conditional intent prediction model on large human-human datasets and fine-tunes on a small human-robot dataset. We evaluate on a set of real-world collabo",

    "translated_abstract": "在协作的人机操纵中，机器人必须预测人类意图并相应调整其行动，以平稳执行任务。然而，人类的意图反过来又取决于机器人采取的动作，造成了一个先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题。先前的方法忽略了这种相互依赖关系，而是训练独立于机器人行动的边际意图预测模型。这是因为在缺乏配对的人机交互数据集的情况下，训练条件模型是困难的。我们能否转而利用更容易获取的大规模人类-人类交互数据？我们的关键见解是利用人类和机器人行动之间的对应关系，实现从人类-人类到人类-机器人数据的迁移学习。我们提出了一种新颖的架构InteRACT，该架构在大型人类-人类数据集上预训练条件意图预测模型，并在小型人机数据集上进行微调。我们在一组真实世界的协作数据上进行评估。",
