This method outperforms previous results in semi-supervised learning and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, improving upon the Predicting View-Assignments With Support Samples (PAWS) semi-supervised learning method.

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了PAWS-VMK，一种改进的原型半监督学习方法，专门设计用于利用冻结的基础模型作为神经网络骨干，该方法在计算机视觉领域中优于以往的半监督学习和超出分布（OOD）检测结果，改进了Predicting View-Assignments With Support Samples（PAWS）半监督学习方法。我们引入了(1) 参数化von-Mises Fisher随机邻域嵌入（vMF-SNE）来预训练投影头，使用基础模型的高质量嵌入;(2) 受MixMatch启发的损失，通过对多视图的预测进行平均，提供比PAWS中使用的一致性损失更可靠的监督信号;和(3) 简单k-Means原型选择（SKMPS），一种比其他无监督标签选择方法提供更优越性能的技术。",
