    "translated_abstract": "大规模图机器学习具有挑战性，因为学习模型的复杂性随着图的大小而增加。对图进行子采样是一种可行的替代方案，但在图上进行采样是非平凡的，因为图是非欧几里得的。现有的图采样技术不仅需要计算大矩阵的谱，而且在图发生变化（例如增长）时需要重复这些计算。本文介绍了一种用于一种图极限--图上的信号采样理论。我们证明了图上信号的Poincar\\'e不等式，并展示了满足这一不等式的节点子集的补集是图上信号Paley-Wiener空间的唯一采样集。通过与谱聚类和高斯消元的联系，我们证明了这样的采样集是一致的，即收敛的图序列上的唯一采样集收敛到图极限上的唯一采样集。",
