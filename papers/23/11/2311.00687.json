We propose the Explore-Generate-Simulate (EGS) framework, which takes as input any scenario where an individual is communicating to an audience with a goal they want to achieve. EGS (1) explores the solution space by producing a diverse set of advice relevant to the scenario, (2) generates communication candidates conditioned on subsets of the advice, and (3) simulates the reactions from various audiences to determine both the best candidate and advice to use.

    "translated_abstract": "我们如何与他人进行沟通以实现自己的目标？我们利用先前的经验或他人的建议，或者通过预测对方的反应来构造候选表达。然而，我们的经验是有限和有偏见的，而且对潜在结果进行推理可能是困难且认知上具有挑战性的。本文中，我们探讨了如何利用大型语言模型（LLM）模拟来帮助我们更好地沟通。我们提出了探索-生成-模拟（EGS）框架，该框架接受任何一个个体与一个目标受众进行沟通的场景作为输入。EGS（1）通过生成与场景相关的多样化建议来探索解决方案空间，（2）生成以部分建议为条件的沟通候选，（3）模拟不同受众的反应，以确定最佳候选和建议的使用。我们在涵盖人际沟通十个基本过程的八个场景上评估了该框架。",
