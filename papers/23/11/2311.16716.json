    "translated_abstract": "基于GNN的推荐系统通过多次消息传递在建模复杂的用户-物品交互方面表现出色。然而，现有方法往往忽视了不断变化的用户-物品交互的动态性，这限制了其在适应用户偏好变化和新到达数据分布变化方面的可扩展性和性能。因此，它们在真实世界的动态环境中的可扩展性和性能受到了限制。在这项研究中，我们提出了GraphPro，这是一个将参数高效和动态图预训练与提示学习相结合的框架。这种新颖的组合能够有效捕捉长期用户偏好和短期行为动态，从而实现准确和及时的推荐。我们的GraphPro框架通过无缝集成临时提示机制和图结构提示学习机制到预训练的GNN模型中来解决用户偏好不断变化的挑战。",
