    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been studied for decades with numerous promising models been proposed. Among them, Collaborative Filtering (CF) models are arguably the most successful one due to its high accuracy in recommendation and elimination of privacy-concerned personal meta-data from training. This paper extends the usage of CF-based model to the task of course recommendation. We point out several challenges in applying the existing CF-models to build a course recommendation engine, including the lack of rating and meta-data, the imbalance of course registration distribution, and the demand of course dependency modeling. We then propose several ideas to address these challenges. Eventually, we combine a two-stage CF model regularized by course dependency with a graph-based recommender based on course-transition network, to achieve AUC as high as 0.97 with a real-world dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统已经研究了几十年，提出了许多有前景的模型。其中，协同过滤（CF）模型由于在推荐中具有高准确性并消除了隐私问题，被认为是最成功的一种。本文将CF模型扩展到课程推荐任务中。我们指出了将现有的CF模型应用于构建课程推荐引擎时面临的几个挑战，包括缺乏评分和元数据，课程注册分布不均衡以及课程依赖建模的需求。然后，我们提出了几个解决这些挑战的想法。最终，我们将基于课程依赖性正则化的两阶段CF模型与基于课程转换网络的图形推荐器相结合，实现了0.97的AUC得分，并使用真实世界数据集进行了验证。",
