    "translated_abstract": "视觉变换器在各种计算机视觉任务中，包括图像分类、实例分割和目标检测中获得了显著的关注，并取得了最先进的性能。然而，解决注意力复杂性和有效捕捉图像中细粒度信息仍然存在挑战。现有的解决方案通常采用降采样操作（如池化）来减少计算成本。然而，这种操作是不可逆的，可能导致信息丢失。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为散射视觉变换（SVT）的新方法来解决这些挑战。SVT结合了一个光谱散射网络，实现了对复杂图像细节的捕捉。SVT通过分离低频和高频分量，克服了与降采样操作相关的不可逆问题。此外，SVT引入了一个独特的光谱门控网络，利用Einstein乘法来处理令牌和通道。",
