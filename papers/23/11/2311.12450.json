The CO2 factor is strongly correlated consistently over time with the Utility sector, which is the most carbon intensive in the S&P 500 index.

As a consequence, while it is possible to obtain an efficient hedging portfolio strategy with our methodology for the carbon factor, the same cannot be achieved for the ESG one.
