Plant diseases, however, can negatively affect leaves during agricultural cultivation, resulting in significant losses in crop output and economic value. Therefore, it is crucial for farmers to identify crop diseases. However, this method frequently necessitates hard work, a lot of planning, and in-depth familiarity with plant pathogens. Given these numerous obstacles, it is essential to provide solutions that can easily interface with mobile and IoT devices so that our farmers can guarantee the best possible crop development.

    "translated_abstract": "作物具有重要意义，因为它们是人类获取能量、营养和药用价值的主要来源。然而，植物病害可以在农业栽培过程中对叶片产生负面影响，导致作物产量和经济价值的显著损失。因此，农民能够识别作物病害非常重要。然而，这种方法通常需要辛勤工作、大量计划和对植物病原体的深入了解。鉴于这些障碍，提供能够轻松与移动设备和物联网设备交互的解决方案对于农民来说至关重要。已经开发和研究了各种机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）算法用于植物病害检测的识别，取得了重要且有希望的结果。本文提出了一种新的分类方法，利用了基于注意力的特征提取、RGB和GCC。",
