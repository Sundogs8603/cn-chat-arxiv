    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界的情境中，与环境的任意交互往往是昂贵的，并且专家示范的行为并不总是可用的。为了减少这两者的需求，离线学习从观察（LfO）得到了广泛研究，其中代理通过只有专家状态和与任务无关的非专家状态-动作对来学习解决任务。最先进的分布校正估计（DICE）方法最小化了学习者和专家策略之间的状态占用差异。然而，它们仅限于$f$-divergences（KL和$\\chi^2$）或带有Rubinstein对偶的Wasserstein距离，后者限制了对性能关键的基础距离度量的使用。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了原始Wasserstein DICE（PW-DICE），它通过悲观正则化器最小化专家和学习者状态占用之间的原始Wasserstein距离，并利用了对比学习的dis",
