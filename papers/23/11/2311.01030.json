    "translated_abstract": "基于方面的情感分类旨在判断句子中给定方面术语所传达的情感极性。情感极性不仅由局部上下文决定，还与远离给定方面术语的词汇相关。最近的基于注意力模型在某些情况下无法足够地区分应该更关注哪些词语。与此同时，基于图的模型正在进入基于方向的情感分类以编码句法依赖树信息。但是这些模型并没有充分利用句法依赖树，因为它们忽视了将依赖关系标签信息有效地整合到表示学习中。在本文中，我们通过有效地建模局部和全局特征来解决这些问题。首先，我们设计了一个包含高斯掩码层和协方差自注意层的局部编码器。高斯掩码层倾向于自适应地调整周围方面术语的感受野，以使其不重要化。",
