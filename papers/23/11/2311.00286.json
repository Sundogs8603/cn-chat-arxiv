    "abstract": "In this paper, we present \\textit{JADE}, a targeted linguistic fuzzing platform which strengthens the linguistic complexity of seed questions to simultaneously and consistently break a wide range of widely-used LLMs categorized in three groups: eight open-sourced Chinese, six commercial Chinese and four commercial English LLMs. JADE generates three safety benchmarks for the three groups of LLMs, which contain unsafe questions that are highly threatening: the questions simultaneously trigger harmful generation of multiple LLMs, with an average unsafe generation ratio of \\textbf{$70\\%$} (please see the table below), while are still natural questions, fluent and preserving the core unsafe semantics. We release the benchmark demos generated for commercial English LLMs and open-sourced English LLMs in the following link: https://github.com/whitzard-ai/jade-db. For readers who are interested in evaluating on more questions generated by JADE, please contact us.  \\textit{JADE} is based on Noam",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了JADE，一种针对语言分析的模糊测试平台，通过增强种子问题的语言复杂性，同时并始终能够破坏广泛使用的三类LLM：八个开源中文LLM，六个商业中文LLM和四个商业英文LLM。JADE为这三类LLM生成了三个安全基准，其中包含高度威胁的不安全问题：这些问题可以同时触发多个LLM的有害生成，平均不安全生成比例为70%（请参见下表），同时这些问题仍然是自然、流畅且保留了核心的不安全语义。我们在以下链接中发布了对商业英文LLM和开源英文LLM生成的基准演示：https://github.com/whitzard-ai/jade-db。对于对JADE生成的更多问题感兴趣的读者，请与我们联系。",
