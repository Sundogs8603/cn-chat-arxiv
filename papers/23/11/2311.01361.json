    "translated_abstract": "自动评估视觉-语言任务一直是具有挑战性的，特别是在反映人类判断方面，限制在考虑细致差异方面。尽管GPT-4V在各种多模态任务中显示出了有希望的结果，但将GPT-4V作为这些任务的通用评估器尚未被系统地探索。我们全面验证了GPT-4V在评估目的方面的能力，涉及基础的图像到文本和文本到图像合成、高级图像到图像转换和多图像到文本对齐等任务。我们使用GPT-4V采用了两种评估方法，单一答案评分和配对比较。值得注意的是，GPT-4V在各种任务和评估方法上与人类显示出有希望的一致性，展示了多模态LLMs作为评估器的巨大潜力。尽管存在限制，如限制的视觉清晰度评分和真实世界复杂推理，但它能够提供人类对齐的得分。",
