    "translated_abstract": "正电子发射断层成像（PET）作为一种具有高生化敏感性的成像技术，已被广泛应用于脑疾病诊断和脑科学研究。由于不同示踪剂在同一区域呈现出不同效果，示踪剂的选择对PET成像变得越来越重要。目前，在神经精神治疗中广泛应用PET成像，发现6-18F-氟-3,4-二羟基-L-苯丙氨酸（DOPA）在这一领域比18F标记的氟代脱氧葡萄糖（FDG）更有效。然而，由于制备复杂性以及其他限制，DOPA远不如FDG被广泛使用。为解决这个问题，提出了一种示踪剂转化可逆神经网络（TC-INN）用于图像投影，通过深度学习将FDG图像映射到DOPA图像。通过从FDG到DOPA生成PET图像，获得更多的诊断信息。",
