    "translated_abstract": "投资组合的不充分多样化是家庭生命周期中最昂贵的损失之一。我们使用2015年、2017年和2019年的中国家庭调研数据，提供了关于金融包容服务对家庭投资组合选择和投资效率的影响的新证据。我们假设更高的金融包容渗透率鼓励家庭参与金融市场，从而实现更好的投资组合多样化和投资效率。基准模型的结果与我们提出的假设一致，即更高的金融包容性促使家庭投资于风险资产并增加投资效率。我们进一步估计了一个动态双机器学习模型，定量研究非线性因果效应并跟踪这些效应随时间的动态变化。我们观察到边际效应随时间增加，并且这些效应在低资产、较低教育程度的家庭中更为明显。",
