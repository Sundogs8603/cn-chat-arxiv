    "translated_abstract": "近年来，哈希方法在大规模媒体搜索中因其低存储和强大的表示能力而受到广泛关注。为了描述具有相似整体外观但细微差异的对象，越来越多的研究聚焦于基于哈希的细粒度图像检索。现有的哈希网络通常通过对相同的深层激活张量进行注意力引导来生成局部和全局特征，这限制了特征表示的多样性。为了解决这个限制，我们将卷积描述符替代注意力引导特征，并提出了一种属性分组和挖掘哈希（AGMH）方法，该方法可以在多个描述符中对类别特定的视觉属性进行分组和嵌入，以生成用于有效细粒度图像检索的综合特征表示。具体来说，我们设计了一种注意力分散损失（ADL）来强制描述符关注各种局部区域，并捕捉多样的细微细节。",
