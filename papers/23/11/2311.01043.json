    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶技术作为改变交通和城市流动性的催化剂，正趋向于从基于规则的系统转向基于数据驱动的策略。传统的模块化系统受到级联模块中的累积误差和不灵活的预设规则的限制。相比之下，端到端自动驾驶系统通过完全数据驱动的训练过程，有潜力避免错误累积，尽管由于其黑盒性质，它们往往缺乏透明度，使得决策的验证和可追溯性变得复杂。近期，大型语言模型（LLMs）展示了理解背景、逻辑推理和生成答案等能力。自然而然的想法是利用这些能力赋予自动驾驶以更强大的能力。通过将LLM与基础视觉模型结合，可能打开对开放世界理解、推理和少样本学习的大门，这是当前自动驾驶系统所缺乏的。",
