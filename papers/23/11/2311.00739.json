    "translated_abstract": "编程式弱监督方法通过使用封装启发式数据源的标签函数（LFs）加速标记大规模数据集。然而，创建精确的LFs需要领域专业知识和大量努力。最近，预训练语言模型（PLMs）的进展在各种任务中展示了巨大的潜力。然而，PLMs自主制定准确的LFs的能力仍然是一个未被充分探索的领域。在这项研究中，我们通过引入DataSculpt来填补这一空白，这是一个利用PLMs自动生成LFs的交互式框架。在DataSculpt中，我们结合了各种提示技术、实例选择策略和LF过滤方法来探索广阔的设计领域。最终，我们对DataSculpt在12个涵盖多个任务的真实数据集上的性能进行了全面评估。这个评估揭示了DataSculpt的优点和局限性。",
