Not only do they provide an opportunity to present one's own arguments, but may also gather a broad cross-section of others' arguments. However, the resulting long discussions are difficult to overview. This paper presents a novel unsupervised approach using large language models (LLMs) to generating indicative summaries for long discussions that basically serve as tables of contents. Our approach first clusters argument sentences, generates cluster labels as abstractive summaries, and classifies the generated cluster labels into argumentation frames resulting in a two-level summary. Based on an extensively optimized prompt engineering approach, we evaluate 19~LLMs for generative cluster labeling and frame classification. To evaluate the usefulness of our indicative summaries, we conduct a purpose-driven user study via a new visual interface called Discussion Explorer: It shows that our proposed in",

    "translated_abstract": "在线论坛鼓励人们在许多主题上交流和讨论不同的立场。它们不仅提供了一个展示自己观点的机会，还可以汇集广泛的其他观点。然而，由此产生的长篇讨论很难概览。本文提出了一种利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成长篇讨论指示性摘要的新型无监督方法，基本上作为目录。我们的方法首先对论述句进行聚类，生成聚类标签作为抽象摘要，然后将生成的聚类标签分类为论证框架，从而得到一个两级摘要。基于经过广泛优化的提示工程方法，我们评估了19个LLM用于生成聚类标签和框架分类。为了评估我们指示性摘要的实用性，我们通过一个名为Discussion Explorer的新的可视化界面进行了目标驱动的用户研究：结果表明我们的方法可以提供有用的指示性摘要。",
