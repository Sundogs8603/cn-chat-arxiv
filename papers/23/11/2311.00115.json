    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱是在各种人工智能应用中广泛使用的一种表示实体之间关系的方法，而图嵌入已迅速成为一种标准技术，以便以一种易于推理和决策的方式表示知识图谱。由于这种表示是从行为数据中获得的，无法被人类阅读，因此存在一个担忧，即它可能包含意外的信息，导致偏见。我们提出了EXTRACT：一套解释性和透明的方法来控制知识图谱嵌入中的偏见，以评估和减少受保护信息的隐含存在。我们的方法使用规范相关分析（CCA）来研究训练过程中信息泄漏的存在程度和来源，然后通过解线性方程组将嵌入分解为私有属性的总和。我们在MovieLens1M数据集上进行的实验证明，可以从用户的行为中推断出各种个人属性。",
