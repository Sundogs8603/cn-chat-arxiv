    "translated_abstract": "连接和自动化车辆（CAVs）对交通系统有着深远的影响。然而，大部分的自动化和连接性都需要道路基础设施的支持。额外的支持，如合作智能交通系统（C-ITS）服务，可以促进安全高效的交通，减轻道路车辆对环境的影响。然而，由于技术的快速发展，C-ITS服务的部署要求并不总是清晰的。此外，基础设施投资的成本和收益也存在巨大的不确定性。本研究采用结构化方法来阐述这些要求，并提出了一个CAV准备框架（CRF）的建议。该CRF的主要目的是让道路管理机构评估其物理和数字基础设施的准备情况，定义C-ITS服务的要求，并确定未来的发展路径，以达到更高水平的准备，以支持通过启用C-ITS服务来支持CAVs。",
