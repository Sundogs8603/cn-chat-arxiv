    "translated_abstract": "在家居和工厂环境中开发复杂操纵任务的智能机器人仍然具有挑战性，因为长时程任务、接触丰富的操纵以及需要在各种物体形状和场景布局之间进行泛化。虽然任务和运动规划（TAMP）提供了一个有希望的解决方案，但是它的假设，如动力学模型，限制了它在新颖背景中的适应性。神经物体描述符（NODs）在物体和场景泛化方面显示出了潜力，但在处理更广泛任务方面存在局限性。我们提出的基于TAMP的框架NOD-TAMP从少数人类演示中提取短的操纵轨迹，使用NOD特征来调整这些轨迹，并组合它们来解决广泛的长时程任务。在模拟环境中验证后，NOD-TAMP有效应对各种挑战，优于现有方法，建立了一个强有力的操纵规划框架。",
