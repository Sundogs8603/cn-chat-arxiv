Challenges encompassed data scarcity, linguistic diversity, and domain-specific content. This paper presents lessons learned while crawling and refining data tailored for fine-tuning Vietnamese language models. Crafting such a dataset, while accounting for linguistic intricacies and striking a balance between inclusivity and accuracy, demands meticulous planning. Our paper presents a multidimensional strategy including leveraging existing datasets in the English language and developing customized data-crawling scripts with the assistance of generative AI tools. A fine-tuned LLM model for the Vietnamese language, which was produced using resultant datasets, demonstrated good performance while generating Vietnamese news articles from prompts. The study offers practical solutions and guidance for future fine-tuning models in languages like Vietnamese.",

    "translated_abstract": "数据是调优大型语言模型的基础，但获取合适的数据仍具有挑战性。这些挑战包括数据稀缺、语言多样性和特定领域内容。本文介绍了在爬取和精化针对调优越南语言模型的数据时所学到的经验。制作这样一个数据集需要细致的计划，考虑到语言的复杂性以及在包容性和准确性之间保持平衡。我们的论文提出了一个多维策略，包括利用英语中的现有数据集和借助生成型AI工具开发定制的数据爬取脚本。使用由产生的数据集生成的越南语言模型的调优模型，在从提示生成越南新闻文章时表现出良好性能。该研究为将来调优越南语等语言的模型提供了实用的解决方案和指导。",
