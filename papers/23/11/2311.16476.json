    "translated_abstract": "几何问题求解(GPS)是一项具有挑战性的数学推理任务，需要多模态理解、融合和推理。现有的神经求解器将GPS视为一项视觉-语言任务，但在代表携带丰富和复杂布局信息的几何图表方面表现不足。本文提出了一种名为LANS的布局感知神经求解器，集成了两个新模块：多模态布局感知预训练语言模块(MLA-PLM)和布局感知融合注意力(LA-FA)。MLA-PLM采用结构-语义预训练(SSP)来实现全局关系建模，点匹配预训练(PMP)来实现视觉点和文本点之间的对齐。 LA-FA使用布局感知注意掩模，实现点引导的跨模态融合，进一步提升了LANS的布局感知性能。对Geometry3K和PGPS9K数据集的大量实验证实了布局感知模块的有效性。",
