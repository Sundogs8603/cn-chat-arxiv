    "translated_abstract": "尽管生成式扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面表现出色，但它们也可能被滥用来模仿授权图像，对人工智能系统构成重大威胁。为了保护图像免受基于扩散的仿真管道的威胁，人们已经尝试添加校准扰动。然而，大多数现有方法由于计算量和内存需求过高而对个体用户来说无效甚至不切实际。在这项工作中，我们对攻击潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新发现进行了探索，并提出了新的即插即用策略以实现更有效的保护。特别地，我们探索了攻击LDM中的瓶颈，并发现编码器模块而不是去噪模块是脆弱点。基于这一发现，我们提出了使用分数蒸馏采样（SDS）的策略，以在不损害其强度的前提下使保护速度加倍，内存占用减半。此外，我们还提供了一个强大的保护策略。",
