    "translated_abstract": "实际世界数据的快速数字化为优化医疗服务和加速生物医学发现提供了前所未有的机会。然而，在实践中，这些数据往往以非结构化形式存在，如电子医疗记录中的临床笔记，并且通常受到混杂因素的困扰。本文介绍了TRIALSCOPE，一个用于从人群级观察数据中提取实际世界证据的统一框架。TRIALSCOPE利用生物医学语言模型来扩展规模化的临床文本，采用先进的概率建模进行去噪和插补，并结合最先进的因果推断技术来应对常见的混杂因素。利用临床试验规范作为通用表示形式，TRIALSCOPE提供了一个一键式解决方案，可使用观察数据生成和推理临床假设。在一个包含超过一百万个癌症患者的大规模实际世界数据集上进行了广泛的实验和分析。",
