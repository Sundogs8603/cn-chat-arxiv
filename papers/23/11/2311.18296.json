    "translated_abstract": "人类视觉识别系统展示了令人惊叹的能力，可以将视觉信息压缩成一组含有丰富表示的标记，而无需标签监督。其中一个关键驱动原则是感知分组。尽管在2010年代早期被广泛应用于计算机视觉领域，但感知分组能否被用来推导出生成强大表示的神经视觉识别框架仍然是一个谜。本文提出了Perceptual Group Tokenizer，这是一个完全依赖分组操作来提取视觉特征和进行自我监督表示学习的模型，其中一系列的分组操作被用来迭代性地推断像素或超像素的上下文，以改进特征表示。我们展示了所提出的模型可以达到与最先进的视觉架构相竞争的性能，并且具有自适应计算而无需重新训练的可取性质。",
