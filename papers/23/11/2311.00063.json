    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在不确定、混乱的工作空间中，针对无人机的安全多智能体运动规划问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个可行的运动规划器，它结合了强化学习和基于约束控制的轨迹规划的优点。首先，我们使用单智能体的强化学习从数据中学习到达目标的运动方案，但这些方案可能不是无碰撞的。接下来，我们使用凸优化、概率约束和集合方法来进行约束控制，以确保尽管工作空间、智能体运动和感知不确定，仍能保持安全。所提出的方法可以处理智能体的状态和控制约束，并以很高的概率实现智能体之间以及与工作空间中的静态障碍物的碰撞避免。所提出的方法提供了一个安全的、实时可行的、比仅基于学习的方法更简单训练的多智能体运动规划器。数值模拟和实验显示了方法的有效性。",
