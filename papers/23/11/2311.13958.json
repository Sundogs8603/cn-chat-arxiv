    "translated_abstract": "最近，许多基于张量奇异值分解（t-SVD）的张量恢复方法在处理视觉数据（如彩色图像和视频）方面表现出潜力。然而，当面对显示出非光滑变化的张量数据时，这些方法通常会遭受严重的性能退化。虽然在现实世界中经常观察到这种情况，但传统的基于t-SVD的方法却忽视了这一点。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种新颖的张量恢复模型，其中包括可学习的张量核范数，以解决这一挑战。我们开发了一种名为交替近端乘子方法（APMM）的新优化算法，以迭代地解决提出的张量补全模型。理论分析证明了所提出的APMM收敛到优化问题的Karush-Kuhn-Tucker（KKT）点。此外，我们基于APMM提出了一个多目标张量恢复框架，以有效探索协",
