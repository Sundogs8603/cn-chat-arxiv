    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT于2022年底发布后，带来了人工智能领域研究和商业领域的巨大转变。通过使用有监督微调和人类反馈的强化学习来调整大型语言模型(LLM)的指令，它展示了模型可以回答人类问题并遵循广泛任务面板上的指令。在这一成功之后，对于LLMs的兴趣持续增加，包括学术界和工业界中频繁涌现的新型LLMs，其中包括许多专注于LLMs的初创企业。尽管封闭源代码的LLMs（如OpenAI的GPT、Anthropic的Claude）通常在性能上优于开源对应物，但后者的进展迅速，声称在某些任务上实现了或甚至更好的性能。这不仅对研究，还对业务领域具有重要影响。在ChatGPT一周年之际，我们提供了这一成功的详尽概述，并调查了所有开源LLM声称已经实现了的任务。",
    "tldr": "ChatGPT一周年纪念，调查了开源大型语言模型是否赶上了封闭源代码模型的进展，尽管后者仍然优于前者，但开源模型在某些任务上已经达到了相同甚至更好的性能。",
    "en_tdlr": "On the one-year anniversary of ChatGPT, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to determine if open-source large language models have caught up with their closed-source counterparts. While the latter still outperform the former, open-source models have shown parity or even better performance in certain tasks."
