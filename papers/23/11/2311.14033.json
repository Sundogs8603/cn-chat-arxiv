Deriving accurate forecasting models presents a difficult task due to the day-ahead price's non-stationarity resulting from changing market conditions, e.g., due to changes resulting from the energy crisis in 2021. We present a probabilistic forecasting approach for day-ahead electricity prices using the fully data-driven deep generative model called normalizing flow. Our modeling approach generates full-day scenarios of day-ahead electricity prices based on conditional features such as residual load forecasts. Furthermore, we propose extended feature sets of prior realizations and a periodic retraining scheme that allows the normalizing flow to adapt to the changing conditions of modern electricity markets.
