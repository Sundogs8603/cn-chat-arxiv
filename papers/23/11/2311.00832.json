The objective of this paper is to construct a model and estimate the VaR for a diversified portfolio consisting of multiple cash commodity positions driven by standard Brownian motions and jump processes. Subsequently, a thorough analytical estimation of the VaR is conducted for the proposed model.

    "translated_abstract": "VaR是一个用于评估投资或资本潜在损失风险的定量指标。VaR的估计涉及在特定时间段内，在正常市场条件下，使用一定的可能性对投资组合的潜在损失进行量化。本文的目标是构建一个模型，并对由标准布朗运动和跳跃过程驱动的多个现金商品头寸组成的多样化投资组合进行VaR估计。随后，对该提出的模型进行了全面的VaR分析估计。结果应用于两种不同的商品 -- 玉米和大豆 -- 在有跳跃和无跳跃情况下对VaR值进行了全面比较。",
