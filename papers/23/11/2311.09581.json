    "abstract": "arXiv:2311.09581v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Medical text generation aims to assist with administrative work and highlight salient information to support decision-making. To reflect the specific requirements of medical text, in this paper, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate the completeness, conciseness, and attribution of the generated text at a fine-grained level. The metrics can be computed by various types of evaluators including instruction-following (both proprietary and open-source) and supervised entailment models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting framework, DocLens, with three evaluators on three tasks: clinical note generation, radiology report summarization, and patient question summarization. A comprehensive human study shows that DocLens exhibits substantially higher agreement with the judgments of medical experts than existing metrics. The results also highlight the need to improve open-source evaluators and suggest potential directions.",

    "translated_abstract": "医学文本生成旨在协助行政工作并突出要点信息以支持决策制定。为了反映医学文本的特定要求，本文提出了一组度量标准，用于在细粒度水平上评估生成文本的完整性、简明性和归因性。这些度量标准可以由各种类型的评估者计算，包括遵循说明（专有和开源）和监督蕴涵模型。我们通过三个评估者在三个任务上展示了所得出的框架DocLens的有效性：临床记录生成、放射学报告摘要和患者问题摘要。一项全面的人类研究显示，DocLens与医学专家的判断之间存在相当高的一致性，高于现有指标。结果还突出显示了改进开源评估者的必要性，并提出了潜在的改进方向。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一个名为DocLens的框架，通过一组新的度量标准，在多个任务中展示其对医学文本生成的有效性，并且通过人类研究表明其在与医学专家判断的一致性上优于现有指标，同时指出了改进开源评估者的必要性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a framework called DocLens, demonstrates its effectiveness on medical text generation across multiple tasks with a set of new metrics, and shows through human study its higher agreement with medical experts' judgments compared to existing metrics, while indicating the need for improving open-source evaluators."
