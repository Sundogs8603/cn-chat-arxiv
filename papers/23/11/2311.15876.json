However, most AI models are constrained to execute unimodal tasks, in stark contrast to the comprehensive approaches utilized by medical professionals. To address this, here we present RO-LMM, a multi-purpose large multimodal model (LMM) tailored for the field of radiation oncology. This model covers series of tasks within clinical workflow, adept at clinical report summarization, radiation treatment plan suggestion, and plan-guided target volume segmentation. In particular, to perform consecutive clinical tasks, we further present a novel Consistency Embedding Fine-Tuning (CEFTune) technique, which boosts LMM's robustness to noisy inputs while preserving the capability of handling clean inputs, and transform this concept into LMM-driven segmentation framework as Consistency Embedding S",

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能的最新进展深刻影响了医学领域，为降低临床工作量提供了工具。然而，大多数人工智能模型受限于执行单模式任务，与医学专业人员所使用的综合方法形成鲜明对比。为解决这一问题，本文介绍了RO-LMM，一个专为放射肿瘤学领域设计的多功能大型多模型（LMM）。该模型涵盖了临床工作流中的一系列任务，擅长临床报告摘要、放疗治疗计划建议和计划引导的目标体积分割。为了执行连续的临床任务，我们进一步提出了一种新颖的一致性嵌入微调（CEFTune）技术，提升了LMM对嘈杂输入的鲁棒性，同时保持了处理干净输入的能力，并将该概念转化为LMM驱动的分割框架，即一致性嵌入S。",
