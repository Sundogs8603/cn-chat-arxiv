    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习势函数（MLIPs）领域中，理解数据偏差（特别是构象和结构多样性）与模型泛化之间的复杂关系对于提高量子力学（QM）数据生成的质量至关重要。我们通过两个不同的实验来研究这些动态：一个是固定预算的实验，数据集大小保持恒定；另一个是固定分子集的实验，重点在于固定结构多样性而变化构象多样性。我们的结果揭示了泛化度量中微妙的模式。值得注意的是，为了实现最佳的结构和构象泛化，需要在结构和构象多样性之间达到谨慎的平衡，但现有的QM数据集并不满足这种权衡。此外，我们的结果突出了MLIP模型在超出其训练分布泛化的局限性，强调了在模型部署过程中定义适用领域的重要性。",
