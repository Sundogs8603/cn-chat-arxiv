We introduce the term annotation sensitivity to refer to the impact of annotation data collection methods on the annotations themselves and on downstream model performance and predictions. We collect annotations of hate speech and offensive language in five experimental conditions of an annotation instrument, randomly assigning annotators to conditions.

    "translated_abstract": "当训练数据由人工注释者收集时，注释工具的设计、给予注释者的指示、注释者的特征以及他们之间的互动都可能对训练数据产生影响。这项研究证明了创建注释工具时的设计选择也会影响基于得到的注释训练的模型。我们引入了\"注释敏感性\"这个术语，用来指代注释数据收集方法对注释本身以及下游模型性能和预测的影响。我们在五种实验条件下对仇恨言论和冒犯性语言进行注释收集，随机将注释者分配到不同条件下。然后，在每个得到的五个数据集上对BERT模型进行微调，并在每个条件的保留部分上评估模型性能。我们发现在以下方面条件之间存在明显差异：1）仇恨言论/冒犯性语言注释的比例，2）模型性能。",
