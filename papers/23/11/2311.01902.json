    "translated_abstract": "因果模型评估的黄金标准是将模型预测与来自随机对照试验（RCT）的真实效应进行比较。然而，进行RCT可能并不总是可行或道德的。相比之下，基于逆概率加权（IPW）的条件随机化实验提供了一种更加现实的方法，但可能受到估计方差过大的问题。为了解决这个挑战并增强在条件随机化环境中的因果模型评估，我们引入了一种新颖的低方差因果误差估计器，称之为“对比估计器”。通过将相同的IPW估计器应用于模型和真实实验效应，我们的估计器有效地消除了由于IPW引起的方差，并实现了更小的渐近方差。实证研究证明了我们估计器的改进，突显了其在实现接近RCT性能方面的潜力。我们的方法为在条件随机化环境中评估因果推断模型提供了简单但强大的解决方案。",
