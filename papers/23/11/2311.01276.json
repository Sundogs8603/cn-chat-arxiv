    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）已广泛应用于药物发现中的分子图。然而，当前的GNN主要擅长利用短程相互作用（SRI），但难以捕捉长程相互作用（LRI），这两者对于确定分子性质都至关重要。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种将所有原子隐式投射为少数神经原子的方法，这些神经原子抽象出分子内原子组的集体信息。具体而言，我们明确地在神经原子之间交换信息，并将其作为一种增强将其重新投射到原子的表示上。通过这种机制，神经原子在远距离节点之间建立通信通道，有效地将任意节点对的相互作用范围减少到单次跳跃。为了从物理角度对我们的方法进行审查，我们揭示了它与传统的LRI计算方法Ewald求和的联系。我们进行了大量实验验证",
