    "translated_abstract": "在许多工程应用中，常常使用偏微分方程对复杂动态系统进行时空建模。在这项工作中，我们借鉴了算子学习的最新进展，并提出了一种连续的数据驱动建模框架。所提出模型的一个关键特点是对于空间和时间离散化的分辨率不变性，而不需要大量的不同时间分辨率下的训练数据。为了改善校准模型的长期性能，我们进一步提出了一种混合优化方案，利用了基于梯度和无导数的优化方法，能够在短期时间序列和长期统计数据上高效训练。我们通过三个数值实例，包括粘性Burgers方程、Navier-Stokes方程和Kuramoto-Sivashinsky方程，来研究空间连续学习框架的性能。",
