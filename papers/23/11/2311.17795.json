Therefore, we introduce a Marginal Laplacian Score (MLS), a modification of the well known Laplacian Score (LS) tailored to better address imbalanced data. We introduce an assumption that the minority class or anomalous appear more frequently in the margin of the features. Consequently, MLS aims to preserve the local structure of the dataset's margin.

    "translated_abstract": "高维度不平衡数据给机器学习带来了挑战。在没有足够或高质量的标签的情况下，无监督特征选择方法对后续算法的成功至关重要。因此，我们引入了一种边际拉普拉斯分数（MLS），它是著名的拉普拉斯分数（LS）的修改版本，旨在更好地处理不平衡数据。我们假设少数类或异常类在特征的边缘中更频繁出现。因此，MLS旨在保留数据集边缘的局部结构。我们将其集成到利用拉普拉斯分数的现代特征选择方法中。我们将MLS算法集成到可微无监督特征选择（DUFS）中，得到了DUFS-MLS。所提出的方法在合成和公共数据集上展示了稳健且改进的性能。",
