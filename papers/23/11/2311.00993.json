    "translated_abstract": "最近的M5竞赛在零售预测领域推动了技术的发展。然而，我们注意到竞赛挑战与我们在一个大型电子商务公司面临的挑战之间存在重要的差异。我们场景中的数据集比较大（数十万个时间序列），而电子商务可以提供比实体零售商更多的产品选择，导致数据更加间断。为了在可行的计算工作量下扩展到更大的数据集大小，首先，我们研究了一个两层次的层次结构，并提出了一种自上而下的预测方法，在聚合级别上预测较少数量的系列和间断性，然后进行分解以获得决策级别的预测。概率预测是根据分布假设生成的。其次，直接对子样本进行下层级的训练也可以是一种扩展的替代方式。使用主要数据集评估了子集建模的性能。除了专有的数据集外，还使用了其他不同领域的数据集。",
