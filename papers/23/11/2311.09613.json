In response, our goal is to define a detailed way of characterizing the explanation capabilities of modern models and to create a nuanced, interpretable explanation evaluation tool that can generate such characterizations automatically, without relying on expensive API calls or human annotations. Our approach is to (a) define the new task of explanation critiquing - identifying and categorizing any main flaw in an explanation and providing suggestions to address the flaw, (b) create a sizeable, human-verified dataset for this task, and (c) train an open-source, automatic critique model (called Digital Socrates) using this data.

    "translated_abstract": "虽然LLMs可以提供有理有据的解释以及答案，但这些解释的性质和质量仍然知之甚少。作为回应，我们的目标是定义一种详细的方式来表征现代模型的解释能力，创建一个细致且可解释的解释评估工具，该工具可以自动生成这种表征，而无需依赖昂贵的API调用或人类注释。我们的方法是：(a)定义解释批评的新任务——识别和分类解释中的任何主要缺陷，并提供建议来解决这些缺陷；(b)为此任务创建一个规模可观且经过人工验证的数据集；(c)使用这些数据训练一个开源的自动批评模型（称为数字苏格拉底）。通过定量和定性分析，我们展示了数字苏格拉底如何有助于通过检查其理由来揭示有关学生模型的见解。",
