Even though these models can expressively capture event sequences in a one-step-ahead fashion, they are inherently limited for long-term forecasting applications due to the accumulation of errors caused by their sequential nature. To overcome these limitations, we derive ADD-THIN, a principled probabilistic denoising diffusion model for TPPs that operates on entire event sequences. Unlike existing diffusion approaches, ADD-THIN naturally handles data with discrete and continuous components. In experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, our model matches the state-of-the-art TPP models in density estimation and strongly outperforms them in forecasting.",

    "translated_abstract": "在时间点过程（TPP）框架内，自回归神经网络已成为建模连续时间事件数据的标准。尽管这些模型可以以一步预测的方式精确地捕捉事件序列，但由于其顺序性质引起的误差积累，它们在长期预测应用中具有固有的局限性。为了克服这些限制，我们推导出ADD-THIN，一种面向整个事件序列工作的基于概率去噪扩散模型，它自然地处理具有离散和连续成分的数据。在合成和真实数据集的实验中，我们的模型在密度估计方面与最先进的TPP模型相匹配，并在预测方面表现出色。",
