These challenges frequently necessitate collaborative efforts with multiple stakeholders which often lead to prolonged decision-making processes and significant delays. To mitigate these challenges and capitalize on the advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose an interactive assortment planning framework, InteraSSort that augments LLMs with optimization tools to assist store planners in making decisions through interactive conversations.
