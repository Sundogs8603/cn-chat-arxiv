    "translated_abstract": "尽管对于边缘设备设计的轻量级深度神经网络（DNN）进行了大量研究，但当前的人脸检测器并不能完全满足集成了嵌入式DNN的\"智能\"CMOS图像传感器（iCIS）的要求。这些传感器在各种实际应用中至关重要，例如节能手机和带始终开启能力的监控系统。其中一个值得注意的局限性是始终开启场景下的合适人脸检测器的缺失，这是图像传感器级别应用的一个关键方面。这些检测器必须在图像信号处理器（ISP）接管之前直接处理传感器原始数据。这种差距在实现这种场景下的最佳性能方面带来了重大挑战。需要进一步的研究和开发来弥合这一差距，充分利用iCIS应用的潜力。在本研究中，我们的目标是通过探索极低位轻量级人脸检测器来弥合这一差距，重点是始终开启的人脸检测。",
