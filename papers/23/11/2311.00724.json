    "abstract": "Telecom industries lose globally 46.3 Billion USD due to fraud. Data mining and machine learning techniques (apart from rules oriented approach) have been used in past, but efficiency has been low as fraud pattern changes very rapidly. This paper presents an industrialized solution approach with self adaptive data mining technique and application of big data technologies to detect fraud and discover novel fraud patterns in accurate, efficient and cost effective manner. Solution has been successfully demonstrated to detect International Revenue Share Fraud with <5% false positive. More than 1 Terra Bytes of Call Detail Record from a reputed wholesale carrier and overseas telecom transit carrier has been used to conduct this study.",

    "translated_abstract": "电信行业由于欺诈行为每年全球损失463亿美元。过去使用数据挖掘和机器学习技术（除了规则导向方法）来进行欺诈检测，但效率很低，因为欺诈模式变化非常快。本文提出了一种工业化解决方案，采用自适应数据挖掘技术和大数据技术来准确、高效、低成本地检测欺诈并发现新的欺诈模式。该解决方案已成功应用于<5%的误报率检测国际收入分成欺诈。本研究使用了来自知名批发运营商和海外电信中转运营商的超过1TB的通话详单记录进行实证研究。",
