    "translated_abstract": "人类白蛋白对指示身体整体健康至关重要。准确预测血浆白蛋白水平并确定适当剂量是亟需解决的临床挑战，尤其是在危重患者中，以保持最佳血液水平。然而，人类白蛋白预测并不简单，必须利用生化标志物的动态性以及治疗患者的经验。此外，真实临床数据中经常遇到分布转移问题，这可能导致模型预测性能下降，降低模型应用的可靠性。在本文中，我们提出了一个名为Out-of-Distribution Generalized Dynamic Graph神经网络的框架，用于人类白蛋白预测（DyG-HAP），能够提供在住院期间为重症监护病房（ICU）患者提供准确的白蛋白预测。",
