    "translated_abstract": "解决全球优化问题的许多方法通常依赖于对特定数学原语的非线性约束的放松。这在应用中对于黑盒、隐式或更一般的约束是有限制的。为了解决这种限制，Bertsimas和Ozturk（2023）提出了OCTHaGOn作为一种通过使用基于超平面的决策树近似非线性约束来解决黑盒全球优化问题的方法，然后使用这些树构建原始问题的统一混合整数优化（MIO）近似。我们对该方法进行了扩展，通过（i）使用除决策树之外的其他MIO可表示的ML模型（如梯度提升树，多层感知器和支持向量机）来近似原始问题，（ii）提出适应性采样程序以获得更准确的基于机器学习的约束近似，（iii）利用鲁棒优化技术",
