    "abstract": "In this paper we model benchmark beating with the increasing convex order (ICX order). The mean constraint in the mean-variance theory of portfolio selection can be regarded as beating a constant. We then investigate the problem of minimizing the variance of a portfolio with ICX order constraints, based on which we also study the problem of beating-performance-variance efficient portfolios. The optimal and efficient portfolios are all worked out in closed form for complete markets.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们使用增加的凸顺序（ICX顺序）对超越基准进行建模。在组合选择的均值-方差理论中，均值约束可以看作是超越一个常数。然后，我们研究了在ICX顺序约束下最小化投资组合方差的问题，基于此，我们还研究了超越性能-方差高效投资组合的问题。在完备市场中，所有最优和高效的投资组合都可以通过闭合形式求解。",
