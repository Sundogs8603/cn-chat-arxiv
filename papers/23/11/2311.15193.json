    "translated_abstract": "在自动驾驶或自主移动机器人领域，预测拥挤场景中行人的轨迹是不可或缺的，因为估计周围行人的未来位置有助于决策避免碰撞。这是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为人类具有不同的行走方式，当前环境中的人与物体之间的交互，特别是人与人之间的交互是复杂的。以前的研究者关注如何建模人与人之间的交互，但忽视了交互的相对重要性。为了解决这个问题，引入了一种基于相关熵的新机制。所提出的机制不仅可以衡量人与人之间交互的相对重要性，还可以为每个行人建立个人空间。进一步提出了包括这个数据驱动机制的交互模块。在提出的模块中，数据驱动机制可以有效提取动态人与人之间的特征表示。",
