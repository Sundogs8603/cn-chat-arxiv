    "translated_abstract": "发现和修复错误对于初学者和专业程序员来说都是一项耗时的任务。之前的研究已经确定了各个级别程序员之间频繁错误模式的差异。然而，初学者和专家之间的不同倾向尚未被揭示。通过了解不同级别程序员的频繁错误，教师可以为不同级别的学习者提供有用的建议。本文提出了一种基于规则的错误分类工具，用于对由错误和正确程序组成的代码对进行错误分类。我们对95,631个代码对进行错误分类，平均找到3.47个错误，这些代码对由各个级别的程序员在一个在线评测系统上提交。分类的错误被用于分析初学者和专家程序员之间频繁错误的差异。分析结果显示，在相同的入门问题中，初学者的错误是由于缺乏编程知识导致的。",
