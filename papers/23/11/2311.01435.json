Notably, our algorithm does not need labels and establishes the unique (and efficient) identifiability of the hidden halfspace under this distributional assumption. The sample and time complexity of the algorithm are polynomial in the dimension and $1/\\epsilon$. The algorithm uses only the first two moments of suitable re-weightings of the empirical distribution, which we call contrastive moments; its analysis uses classical facts about generalized Dirichlet polynomials and relies crucially on a new monotonicity property of the moment ratio of truncations of logcon",

    "translated_abstract": "当环境分布是未知关于d维空间d倍对称、对数凹的分布的其中一组分布，半空间是通过删除至少一个分量分布中的ε比例的数据引入的情况下，我们提供了一个多项式时间算法来学习具有边缘的高维半空间，目标是在所需的TV距离内。值得注意的是，我们的算法不需要标签，并且在这个分布假设下建立了隐藏半空间的唯一性（和高效性）。算法的样本和时间复杂性在维度和1/ε上都是多项式。该算法只使用经验分布的适当重新加权的前两个矩，我们将其称为对比矩；其分析使用了关于广义Dirichlet多项式的经典事实，并且关键依赖于对对数凹截断的矩比的一个新单调性质。",
