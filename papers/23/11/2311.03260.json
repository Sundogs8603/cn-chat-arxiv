    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了Kuramoto图神经网络（KuramotoGNN），一种新颖的连续深度图神经网络（GNN），它采用Kuramoto模型来缓解过度平滑现象，即随着层数增加，GNN中节点特征变得难以区分的问题。Kuramoto模型捕捉了非线性耦合振荡器的同步行为。从耦合振荡器的视角，我们首先展示了Kuramoto模型与基本GNN之间的联系，然后说明了GNN中的过度平滑现象可以被解释为Kuramoto模型中的相位同步。KuramotoGNN用频率同步取代了这种相位同步，以防止节点特征收敛到一起，同时使系统达到稳定的同步状态。我们在各种实验中验证了KuramotoGNN在减少过度平滑方面相对于基线GNN和现有方法的优势。",
