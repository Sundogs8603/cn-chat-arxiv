    "abstract": "arXiv:2311.15332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: In the context of deep learning research, where model introductions continually occur, the need for effective and efficient evaluation remains paramount. Existing methods often emphasize accuracy metrics, overlooking stability. To address this, the paper introduces the Accuracy-Stability Index (ASI), a quantitative measure incorporating both accuracy and stability for assessing deep learning models. Experimental results demonstrate the application of ASI, and a 3D surface model is presented for visualizing ASI, mean accuracy, and coefficient of variation. This paper addresses the important issue of quantitative benchmarking metrics for deep learning models, providing a new approach for accurately evaluating accuracy and stability of deep learning models. The paper concludes with discussions on potential weaknesses and outlines future research directions.",

    "translated_abstract": "在深度学习研究中，模型的不断引入使得有效和高效的评估变得至关重要。现有方法通常强调准确度指标，忽视了稳定性。为解决这个问题，本文引入了准确性-稳定性指数（ASI），它是一种综合考虑准确度和稳定性的定量评估深度学习模型的指标。实验结果展示了ASI的应用，同时提供了一个用于可视化ASI、平均准确度和变异系数的3D曲面模型。本文解决了深度学习模型定量基准评估指标的重要问题，并提供了一种准确评估深度学习模型准确性和稳定性的新方法。文章最后还对潜在弱点进行了讨论，并概述了未来的研究方向。",
