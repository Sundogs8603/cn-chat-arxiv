    "abstract": "In multi-lingual societies, where multiple languages are spoken in a small geographic vicinity, informal conversations often involve mix of languages. Existing speech technologies may be inefficient in extracting information from such conversations, where the speech data is rich in diversity with multiple languages and speakers. The DISPLACE (DIarization of SPeaker and LAnguage in Conversational Environments) challenge constitutes an open-call for evaluating and bench-marking the speaker and language diarization technologies on this challenging condition. The challenge entailed two tracks: Track-1 focused on speaker diarization (SD) in multilingual situations while, Track-2 addressed the language diarization (LD) in a multi-speaker scenario. Both the tracks were evaluated using the same underlying audio data. To facilitate this evaluation, a real-world dataset featuring multilingual, multi-speaker conversational far-field speech was recorded and distributed. Furthermore, a baseline sys",

    "translated_abstract": "在多语言社会中，当一个小地理区域中同时使用多种语言进行非正式对话时，现有的语音技术可能无法高效地从这些对话中提取信息，因为语音数据包含多种语言和发言人的丰富多样性。DISPLACE（会话环境中的发言人和语言辨识问题）挑战通过一个开放的评估和基准测试来评估多发言人和多语言的辨识技术在这种具有挑战性的情况下的表现。该挑战包括两个任务：任务1关注多语言环境中的发言人辨识，任务2则关注多发言人情境中的语言辨识。这两个任务使用相同的音频数据进行评估。为了促进评估，还创建了一个真实世界的数据集，包含多语言、多发言人的远场对话语音。此外，还创建了基准系统用于对挑战任务进行衡量。",
