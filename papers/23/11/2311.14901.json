    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2311.14901v2 公告类型:替换 摘要: 代码搜索引擎是软件开发中的重要工具。许多代码搜索方法涌现出来，专注于代码搜索的总体排名性能。本文从另一个角度研究代码搜索，分析了代码搜索模型的偏见。有偏见的代码搜索引擎会提供较差的用户体验，即使它们表现出色总体表现。由于不同的开发惯例（例如，更喜欢长查询还是缩写），有些程序员会发现引擎有用，而其他人可能很难获得理想的搜索结果。为了减轻偏见，我们开发了一个通用的去偏见框架，利用重新排序来校准搜索结果。它可以轻松插入现有引擎，并处理将来发现的新代码搜索偏见。实验证明我们的框架能够有效减少偏见。与此同时，在去偏见后，代码搜索的总体排名表现也得到了改善。",
