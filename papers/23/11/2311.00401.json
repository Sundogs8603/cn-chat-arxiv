    "abstract": "Human pose assessment and correction play a crucial role in applications across various fields, including computer vision, robotics, sports analysis, healthcare, and entertainment. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Transformer based Framework (STTF) for human pose assessment and correction in education scenarios such as physical exercises and science experiment. The framework comprising skeletal tracking, pose estimation, posture assessment, and posture correction modules to educate students with professional, quick-to-fix feedback. We also create a pose correction method to provide corrective feedback in the form of visual aids. We test the framework with our own dataset. It comprises (a) new recordings of five exercises, (b) existing recordings found on the internet of the same exercises, and (c) corrective feedback on the recordings by professional athletes and teachers. Results show that our model can effectively measure and comment on the quality of students' actions. T",

    "translated_abstract": "人体姿势评估和修正在计算机视觉、机器人技术、体育分析、医疗保健和娱乐等各个领域具有重要作用。本文提出了一种基于时空变换器的框架（STTF），用于教育场景中的人体姿势评估和修正，例如体育锻炼和科学实验。该框架包括骨骼跟踪、姿势估计、姿势评估和姿势修正模块，以向学生提供专业、快速修正的反馈。我们还开发了一种姿势修正方法，以视觉辅助的形式提供修正性反馈。我们使用自己的数据集对该框架进行了测试，包括（a）五个锻炼动作的新录制，（b）在互联网上找到的同一锻炼动作的现有录制，以及（c）由专业运动员和教师对录制的修正性反馈。结果表明，我们的模型能够有效评估学生行为的质量并进行点评。",
