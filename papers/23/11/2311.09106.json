This paper defines the context required to fully understand such ambiguous statements in a computational setting and ground them in real-world entities, actions, and attitudes. We propose two challenging datasets that require an understanding of the real-world context of the text.

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体话语经常包括“看似相似的语言被政治光谱两端使用”，往往转化为截然不同的观点。例如，“思念与祈祷”可能表达对大规模枪击受害者的同情，也可能批评对该问题缺乏立法行动。本文在计算环境中定义了完全理解此类模棱两可陈述所需的背景，并使其基于现实世界的实体、行动和态度。我们提出了两个需要理解文本实际背景的具有挑战性的数据集。我们将这些数据集与基于大型预训练模型（如RoBERTa和GPT-3）构建的模型进行了基准测试。此外，我们开发并对现有的“议语情境化框架”和“政治角色表征”模型进行了基准测试。我们分析了数据集和预测以获得更多洞见。",
