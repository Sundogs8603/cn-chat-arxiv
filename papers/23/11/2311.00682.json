    "translated_abstract": "光子计数辐射探测器已经成为医学成像模态（如正电子发射断层扫描或计算机断层扫描）中重要的组成部分。最有前景的探测器之一是宽禁带室温半导体探测器，它依赖于伽玛/ x射线光子与探测器材料的相互作用，其中包括康普顿散射，导致单个光子的多次相互作用事件（MIPE）。对于具有康普顿散射和光电事件之间探测能量重叠的半导体探测器（如CdZnTeSe（CZTS）），使用传统的读出电子学或信号处理算法几乎不可能区分康普顿散射事件和光电事件。在这里，我们报道了一个名为CoPhNet的深度学习分类器，用于区分CdZnTeSe（CZTS）半导体探测器中的康普顿散射和光电相互作用的伽玛/ x射线光子。我们的CoPhNet模型是使用模拟数据进行训练的。",
