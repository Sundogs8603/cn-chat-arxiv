    "abstract": "As Federated Learning (FL) grows in popularity, new decentralized frameworks are becoming widespread. These frameworks leverage the benefits of decentralized environments to enable fast and energy-efficient inter-device communication. However, this growing popularity also intensifies the need for robust security measures. While existing research has explored various aspects of FL security, the role of adversarial node placement in decentralized networks remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing the performance of decentralized FL for various adversarial placement strategies when adversaries can jointly coordinate their placement within a network. We establish two baseline strategies for placing adversarial node: random placement and network centrality-based placement. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel attack algorithm that prioritizes adversarial spread over adversarial centrality by maximizing the average network distance between adversaries.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着联邦学习（FL）越来越受欢迎，新的分布式框架也越来越普及。这些框架利用分布式环境的优势，实现了快速和节能的设备间通信。然而，这种增长也加大了对强大安全措施的需求。尽管现有研究已经探讨了FL安全的各个方面，但是对于分布式网络中对抗节点部署的作用仍然较少研究。本文通过分析不同对抗部署策略下分布式FL的性能，来填补这一空白。我们建立了两种基线策略来部署对抗节点：随机部署和基于网络中心性的部署。在此基础上，我们提出了一种新颖的攻击算法，通过最大化对抗节点之间的平均网络距离，优先考虑对抗的分散性而不是中心性。",
