Retrieval plays a crucial role in verifiable generation. Specifically, the retrieved documents not only supplement knowledge to help the LLM generate correct answers, but also serve as supporting evidence for the user to verify the LLM's output. However, the widely used retrievers become the bottleneck of the entire pipeline and limit the overall performance. Their capabilities are usually inferior to LLMs since they often have much fewer parameters than the large language model and have not been demonstrated to scale well to the size of LLMs. If the retriever does not correctly find the supporting documents, the LLM can not generate the correct and verifiable answer, which overshadows the LLM's remarkable abilities.

    "translated_abstract": "可验证生成旨在使大型语言模型（LLM）生成具有支撑文件的文本，这使用户能够灵活验证答案，并使LLM的输出更可靠。检索在可验证生成中起着至关重要的作用。具体而言，检索到的文件不仅补充知识以帮助LLM生成正确答案，还作为支持用户验证LLM输出的证据。然而，广泛使用的检索器成为整个流程的瓶颈，并限制了整体性能。由于通常具有的参数比大型语言模型少得多，并且尚未证明能够良好地扩展到LLM的规模，因此它们的能力通常比LLMs差。如果检索器未能正确找到支持文件，则LLM将无法生成正确和可验证的答案，这会掩盖LLM的显著能力。为解决这些问",
