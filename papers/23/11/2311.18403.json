    "translated_abstract": "不可学习的数据集会通过向干净训练集引入精心设计且难以察觉的扰动，导致模型的泛化性能急剧下降。许多现有防御方法，如JPEG压缩和对抗训练，能够有效对抗基于范数约束的附加噪声的不可学习数据集。然而，最新提出的一种基于卷积的不可学习数据集让现有的防御方法无效，给防御者带来更大挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们在简化的情景中将基于卷积的不可学习样本表达为将矩阵乘以干净样本的结果，并将类内矩阵不一致性形式化为$\\Theta_{imi}$，将类间矩阵一致性形式化为$\\Theta_{imc}$以研究基于卷积的不可学习数据集的工作机制。我们推测增加这两个度量将有助于减轻不可学习效果。",
