    "translated_abstract": "现代软件已成为许多学科和应用环境中日常活动的重要组成部分。利用人工智能（AI）实现智能自动化在许多领域取得了突破。AI的有效性可以归功于多种因素，其中之一是数据的增加可用性。欧洲联盟（EU）的一般数据保护条例（GDPR）等法规的出台是为了确保个人数据的保护。收集、处理或分享个人数据的软件系统必须遵守这些法规的合规性要求。开发符合法规要求的软件在软件开发过程中要求工程（RE）阶段中需要重视处理法律要求。RE关注的是指定和维护一个系统的需求，包括法律要求。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了从合规角度分析法律要求，特别是在软件开发过程中的要求工程阶段，以确保软件的合规性。主要关注欧盟的一般数据保护条例（GDPR）等法规对收集、处理或分享个人数据的软件系统的规定。"
