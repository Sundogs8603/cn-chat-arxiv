    "translated_abstract": "在最优输送（OT）中，蒙日映射被称为以最经济的方式将源分布传输到目标分布的映射。最近，已经开发并应用了多种用于Monge映射的神经估计器，并在各种未配对的领域转换任务中进行了应用，例如在单细胞生物学和计算机视觉中。然而，经典的OT框架强制保持质量守恒，这使其容易受到离群值的影响，并限制了它在现实世界场景中的适用性。后者在OT领域转换任务中可能特别有害，因为其中显式考虑了样本在分布中的相对位置。尽管在离散设置中，不平衡OT解决了这一挑战，但其集成到神经Monge映射估计器中受到了有限的关注。我们提出了一种理论上基础的方法，将不平衡性纳入到任何Monge映射估计器中。我们改进了现有的估计器以模",
