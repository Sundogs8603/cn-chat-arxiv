    "translated_abstract": "现代科学研究面临的主要挑战是黄金标准数据的有限可用性，而获取这些数据既耗费时间又费力。随着机器学习（ML）的快速发展，科学家们依赖于ML算法使用易得的协变量来预测这些黄金标准结果。然而，这些预测结果常常直接用于后续的统计分析中，忽略了预测过程引入的不精确性和异质性。这可能导致虚假的正面结果和无效的科学结论。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一种假设简化和数据自适应的后预测推断（POP-Inf）过程，它允许基于ML预测结果进行有效和有力的推断。它的“假设简化”属性保证在广泛的统计量上不基于ML预测做出可靠的统计推断。它的“数据自适应”特性保证了相较于现有方法的效率提高。",
