This field faces unique challenges such as domain-specific terminologies and reasoning over specialized knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-disciplinary Collaboration (MC) framework for the medical domain that leverages LLM-based agents in a role-playing setting that participate in a collaborative multi-round discussion, thereby enhancing LLM proficiency and reasoning capabilities. This training-free framework encompasses five critical steps: gathering domain experts, proposing individual analyses, summarising these analyses into a report, iterating over discussions until a consensus is reached, and ultimately making a decision. Our work focuses on the zero-shot setting, which is applicable in real-world scenarios. Experimental results on nine dataset",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)尽管在各种通用领域取得了显著进展，但在医学和医疗保健领域面临重大障碍。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个新颖的医学领域的跨学科合作(MC)框架，利用基于LLM的代理在角色扮演设置中参与协作多轮讨论，从而提高LLM的熟练程度和推理能力。这种无需训练的框架包括五个关键步骤：收集领域专家、提出个别分析、将这些分析总结成报告、在讨论中反复迭代直到达成共识，最终做出决策。我们的工作侧重于零-shot情景，在实际场景中具有适用性。在九个数据集上的实验结果显示...",
