Mobile health applications present a promising avenue for low-cost, scalable physical activity promotion, yet often suffer from small effect sizes and low adherence rates, particularly in comparison to human coaching. Goal-setting is a critical component of health coaching that has been underutilized in adaptive algorithms for mobile health interventions. This paper introduces a modification to the Thompson sampling algorithm that places emphasis on individualized goal-setting by optimizing personalized reward functions. As a step towards supporting goal-setting, this paper offers a balanced approach that can leverage shared structure while optimizing individual preferences and goals. We prove that our modification incurs only a constant penalty on the cumulative regret ",

    "translated_abstract": "身体活动不足仍然是一个主要的公共健康问题，与心血管疾病和2型糖尿病等不良健康结果相关。移动健康应用程序为低成本、可扩展的身体活动促进提供了一个有希望的途径，然而通常效果较小，粘附率低，特别是与人类辅导相比。目标设定是健康辅导的一个关键组成部分，在移动健康干预的自适应算法中一直未充分利用。本文介绍了对Thompson抽样算法的修改，重点放在通过优化个性化奖励函数实现个性化目标设定。作为支持目标设定的一步，本文提供了一个可以利用共享结构同时优化个人偏好和目标的平衡方法。我们证明，我们的修改只对累积遗憾造成一个常数惩罚。",
