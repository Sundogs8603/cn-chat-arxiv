    "abstract": "Geographic privacy or geo-privacy refers to the keeping private of one's geographic location, especially the restriction of geographical data maintained by personal electronic devices. Geo-privacy is a crucial aspect of personal security; however, it often goes unnoticed in daily activities. With the surge in the use of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as GPT-4, for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), the potential risks associated with geo-privacy breaches have intensified. This study develops a location-integrated GPT-4 based model named GeoLocator and designs four-dimensional experiments to demonstrate its capability in inferring the locational information of input imageries and/or social media contents. Our experiments reveal that GeoLocator generates specific geographic details with high accuracy and consequently embeds the risk of the model users exposing geospatial information to the public unintentionally, highlighting the thread of online data sharing, information gathering ",

    "translated_abstract": "地理隐私是指保护个人地理位置的私密性，特别是限制个人电子设备中维护的地理数据。地理隐私是个人安全的重要方面，然而在日常活动中常常被忽视。随着大型多模态模型（如GPT-4）在开源情报（OSINT）中的使用激增，与地理隐私泄露相关的潜在风险加剧。本研究开发了一种名为GeoLocator的基于GPT-4的位置集成模型，并设计了四维实验来展示其推断输入图像和/或社交媒体内容的位置信息的能力。我们的实验结果表明，GeoLocator能够高精度地生成具体的地理细节，从而将模型用户无意中暴露地理空间信息的风险嵌入其中，突显了在线数据共享和信息获取的威胁。",
