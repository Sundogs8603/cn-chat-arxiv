    "translated_abstract": "数据增强是学习高效深度学习模型的重要基础。在所有提出的增强技术中，线性插值训练数据点（也称为Mixup）已被证明在许多应用中非常有效。然而，大多数研究都集中在选择合适的点进行混合，或者应用复杂的非线性插值，而我们则对更相似的点进行更频繁和更强烈的混合感兴趣。为此，我们提出了通过扭曲函数动态改变插值系数的概率分布的方法，取决于要组合的数据点之间的相似性。我们定义了一个高效而灵活的框架来实现这一点，以避免多样性的损失。我们进行了广泛的分类和回归任务实验，结果显示我们提出的方法既提高了模型的性能，又提高了模型的校准性。代码可在https://github.com/ENSTA-U2IS/torch-uncertainty上找到。",
