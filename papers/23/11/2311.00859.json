    "abstract": "Finding optimal adversarial attack strategies is an important topic in reinforcement learning and the Markov decision process. Previous studies usually assume one all-knowing coordinator (attacker) for whom attacking different recipient (victim) agents incurs uniform costs. However, in reality, instead of using one limitless central attacker, the attacks often need to be performed by distributed attack agents. We formulate the problem of performing optimal adversarial agent-to-agent attacks using distributed attack agents, in which we impose distinct cost constraints on each different attacker-victim pair. We propose an optimal method integrating within-step static constrained attack-resource allocation optimization and between-step dynamic programming to achieve the optimal adversarial attack in a multi-agent system. Our numerical results show that the proposed attacks can significantly reduce the rewards received by the attacked agents.",

    "translated_abstract": "寻找最优的对抗攻击策略是强化学习和马尔可夫决策过程中的重要课题。先前的研究通常假设一个全知的协调者（攻击者），攻击不同的接收者（受害者）代理会产生统一的成本。然而，在现实中，攻击通常需要由分布式攻击代理执行，而不是使用一个无限制的中心攻击者。我们在多智能体系统中提出了一个问题，即如何使用分布式攻击代理进行最优的对抗代理间攻击，其中对每个不同的攻击者-受害者对都施加不同的成本约束。我们提出了一种最优方法，通过在步骤内进行静态约束攻击资源分配优化，并在步骤间进行动态规划，以实现多智能体系统中的最优对抗攻击。我们的数值结果表明，所提出的攻击能够显著降低受攻击代理所获得的奖励。",
