    "translated_abstract": "词汇的意义随着时间的推移而变化，词义在这个过程中会演变、出现或消失。对于古代语言来说，由于语料库通常较小、稀疏且嘈杂，准确建模这种变化变得具有挑战性，因此对于意义变化估计的不确定性进行量化变得重要。GASC和DiSC是现有的生成模型，已经被用来分析古希腊文本语料库中目标词汇的意义变化，使用了无监督学习并没有借助任何预训练的帮助。这些模型将给定目标词汇（如\"kosmos\"，意为装饰、秩序或世界）的意义表示为上下文词汇的分布，并将意义的普遍性表示为意义的分布。这些模型使用马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛方法进行拟合，以测量这些表示中的时间变化。在本文中，我们介绍了EDiSC，这是DiSC的嵌入版本，它将词嵌入与DiSC相结合，提供了更优秀的模型性能。我们通过实验证明，EDiSC提供了改进的性能。",
