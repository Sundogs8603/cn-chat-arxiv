    "abstract": "Rejection sampling methods have recently been proposed to improve the performance of discriminator-based generative models. However, these methods are only optimal under an unlimited sampling budget, and are usually applied to a generator trained independently of the rejection procedure. We first propose an Optimal Budgeted Rejection Sampling (OBRS) scheme that is provably optimal with respect to \\textit{any} $f$-divergence between the true distribution and the post-rejection distribution, for a given sampling budget. Second, we propose an end-to-end method that incorporates the sampling scheme into the training procedure to further enhance the model's overall performance. Through experiments and supporting theory, we show that the proposed methods are effective in significantly improving the quality and diversity of the samples.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近提出了拒绝采样方法来改善基于鉴别器的生成模型的性能。然而，这些方法只在无限采样预算下是最优的，并且通常应用于与拒绝过程独立训练的生成器。我们首先提出了一种Optimal Budgeted Rejection Sampling (OBRS)方案，该方案在给定采样预算情况下，对于真实分布和拒绝后分布之间的任何f-散度证明是最优的。其次，我们提出了一种端到端方法，将采样方案融入训练过程，进一步提高模型的整体性能。通过实验证明和支持的理论，我们展示了这些方法在显著提高样本质量和多样性方面的有效性。",
