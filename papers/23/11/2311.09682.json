    "translated_abstract": "我们在一个全新的约束设置中探究了现代大型语言模型的创意问题解决能力。为此，我们创建了MACGYVER，这是一个自动生成的数据集，包含超过1600个特意设计的现实世界问题，旨在引发物体的创新使用，并需要超越常规思维。我们随后向大型语言模型和人类展示我们的数据集，以比较和对比它们的问题解决能力。MACGYVER对这两个群体都具有挑战性，但以独特和互补的方式呈现。例如，人类擅长熟悉的任务，但在特定领域知识上有困难，导致更高的差异。相比之下，大型语言模型暴露于各种专业知识，尝试更广泛的问题，但在提出物理上不可行的行动时失败。最后，我们对大型语言模型进行了详细的错误分析，并展示了通过新的提示技术提高它们的问题解决能力的潜力。",
