    "abstract": "Design/methodology/approach We compared the awareness of 813 people in Wuhan city from January to March 2023 (Wuhan 2023) and 2,973 people in East and South China from February to May 2020 (China 2020) using responses to questionnaires conducted at Japanese local subsidiaries during each period. Purpose As the coronavirus pandemic becomes less terrifying than before, there is a trend in countries around the world to abolish strict behavioral restrictions imposed by governments. How should overseas subsidiaries change the way they manage human resources in response to these system changes? To find an answer to this question, this paper examines what changes occurred in the mindset of employees working at local subsidiaries after the government's strict behavioral restrictions were introduced and lifted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings The results showed that the analytical model based on conservation of resources (COR) theory can be applied to both China 2020 and Wuhan 2023. Howev",
