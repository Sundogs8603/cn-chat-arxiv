    "translated_abstract": "物理信息神经网络(PINNs)是解决非线性偏微分方程(PDEs)和推断解的吸引人的数据驱动工具。与传统神经网络(NNs)只在解决数据上进行训练不同，PINN将PDE的残差结合到其损失函数中，并在解决域上的一组插值点上训练以最小化该残差。本文探讨了使用Schwarz交替法将PINN与彼此和传统数值模型(即通过有限元、有限差分或有限体积方法获得的完全序模型或FOMs)耦合的方法，其中对物理域进行了分解。众所周知，当PDE解具有陡峭的梯度时，训练PINN可能很困难。在这种背景下，我们探讨了使用域分解和Schwarz交替法加速PINN训练阶段的不同方法。",
