We address this challenge by building and releasing the StorySeeker toolkit, including a richly annotated dataset of 502 Reddit posts and comments, a detailed codebook adapted to the social media context, and models to predict storytelling at the document and span level. Our dataset is sampled from hundreds of popular English-language Reddit communities ranging across 33 topic categories, and it contains fine-grained expert annotations, including binary story labels, story spans, and event spans. We evaluate a range of detection methods using our data, and we identify the distinctive textual features of online storytelling, focusing on storytelling span detection, which we introduce as a new task.

    "translated_abstract": "在线社区中的故事检测是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为故事分散在社区中，并且与单个文本中的非叙事部分交织在一起。我们通过构建和发布StorySeeker工具包来解决这一挑战，其中包括一个包含502个Reddit帖子和评论的丰富注释数据集，一个适应社交媒体背景的详细的代码书，以及用于在文档和跨度级别预测叙事的模型。我们的数据集是从数百个流行的英语Reddit社区中抽样而来，涵盖了33个主题类别，它包含了细粒度的专家注释，包括二元故事标签，故事跨度和事件跨度。我们使用我们的数据评估了一系列检测方法，并确定了在线叙事的独特文本特征，重点关注叙事跨度检测，这是我们引入的一个新任务。我们阐明了大规模叙事的分布特征。",
