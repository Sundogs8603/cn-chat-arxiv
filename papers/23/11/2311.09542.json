    "abstract": "arXiv:2311.09542v2 Announce Type: replace  Abstract: Questions posed by information-seeking users often contain implicit false or potentially harmful assumptions. In a high-risk domain such as maternal and infant health, a question-answering system must recognize these pragmatic constraints and go beyond simply answering user questions, examining them in context to respond helpfully. To achieve this, we study assumptions and implications, or pragmatic inferences, made when mothers ask questions about pregnancy and infant care by collecting a dataset of 2,727 inferences from 500 questions across three diverse sources. We study how health experts naturally address these inferences when writing answers, and illustrate that informing existing QA pipelines with pragmatic inferences produces responses that are more complete, mitigating the propagation of harmful beliefs.",

    "translated_abstract": "信息求助用户提出的问题通常包含隐含的错误或潜在有害的假设。在诸如孕产妇健康这样的高风险领域，问答系统必须识别这些实用约束，并不仅仅回答用户问题，还要在上下文中审视这些问题以给出有帮助的回应。为了实现这一点，我们通过收集来自三个不同来源的500个问题中的2,727个推断的数据集，研究了母亲在提出怀孕和婴儿护理问题时所做的假设和推断，进而研究了健康专家在撰写答案时如何自然地处理这些推断，并说明利用实用推断告知现有的问答管道可以产生更完整的回答，从而减少有害信念的传播。",
