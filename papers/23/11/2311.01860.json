    "abstract": "Analogy is one of the core capacities of human cognition; when faced with new situations, we often transfer prior experience from other domains. Most work on computational analogy relies heavily on complex, manually crafted input. In this work, we relax the input requirements, requiring only names of entities to be mapped. We automatically extract commonsense representations and use them to identify a mapping between the entities. Unlike previous works, our framework can handle partial analogies and suggest new entities to be added. Moreover, our method's output is easily interpretable, allowing for users to understand why a specific mapping was chosen.  Experiments show that our model correctly maps 81.2% of classical 2x2 analogy problems (guess level=50%). On larger problems, it achieves 77.8% accuracy (mean guess level=13.1%). In another experiment, we show our algorithm outperforms human performance, and the automatic suggestions of new entities resemble those suggested by humans. ",

    "translated_abstract": "类比是人类认知的核心能力之一；在面对新情境时，我们经常从其他领域中转移先前的经验。大多数关于计算类比的工作都严重依赖复杂的手工制作输入。在本研究中，我们放松了输入要求，只需对实体进行映射。我们自动提取常识表示，并使用它们来确定实体之间的映射关系。与以前的方法不同，我们的框架可以处理部分类比，并建议添加新的实体。此外，我们的方法的输出易于解释，用户可以理解为什么选择了特定的映射。实验证明，我们的模型正确地映射了81.2％的经典2x2类比问题（猜测水平=50％）。在更大的问题上，它的准确率达到77.8％（平均猜测水平=13.1％）。在另一个实验中，我们展示了我们的算法胜过了人类的表现，并且自动建议的新实体类似于人类建议的实体。",
