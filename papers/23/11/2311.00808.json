One critical task for safe deployment is the detection of anomalous or out-of-distribution samples that may require human intervention. In this work, we present a novel loss function and recipe for training networks with improved density-based out-of-distribution sensitivity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on CIFAR-10, notably reducing the false-positive rate of the relative Mahalanobis distance method on far-OOD tasks by over 50%.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管深度学习模型在受控环境中取得了广泛成功，但在开放世界环境中使用仍存在一些障碍。确保安全部署的一个关键任务是检测可能需要人工干预的异常或超出分布的样本。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的损失函数和训练网络的方法，以提高基于密度的超出分布敏感性。我们在CIFAR-10数据集上证明了我们方法的有效性，尤其在远离分布的任务上，相对马哈拉诺比斯距离方法的误检率降低超过50%。",
