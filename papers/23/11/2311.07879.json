    "abstract": "arXiv:2311.07879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Extensive efforts in automated approaches for content moderation have been focused on developing models to identify toxic, offensive, and hateful content with the aim of lightening the load for moderators. Yet, it remains uncertain whether improvements on those tasks have truly addressed moderators' needs in accomplishing their work. In this paper, we surface gaps between past research efforts that have aimed to provide automation for aspects of content moderation and the needs of volunteer content moderators, regarding identifying violations of various moderation rules. To do so, we conduct a model review on Hugging Face to reveal the availability of models to cover various moderation rules and guidelines from three exemplar forums. We further put state-of-the-art LLMs to the test, evaluating how well these models perform in flagging violations of platform rules from one particular forum. Finally, we conduct a user survey stud",

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能模型在识别有毒、冒犯和令人讨厌的内容方面取得了长足的进展，旨在减轻管理员的工作负担。然而，目前尚不清楚这些任务的改进是否真正满足了管理员在工作中的需求。本文揭示了过去研究努力致力于为内容管理的各个方面提供自动化支持与志愿内容管理员的需求之间存在的差距，尤其是在识别违反各种管理规则方面。为此，我们在Hugging Face上对模型进行了调查，以揭示涵盖三个示范论坛的各种管理规则和指南的模型的可用性。我们进一步对最先进的LLM进行了测试，评估这些模型在标记某个特定论坛的平台规则违规方面的表现。最后，我们进行了用户调查研究。",
