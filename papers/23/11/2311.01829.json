    "translated_abstract": "在许多现实世界的系统中，如自适应机器人，仅实现单一的优化解决方案可能是不够的。相反，通常需要一组具有多样性且高性能的解决方案来适应不同的环境和需求。这是质量-多样性（QD）的领域，旨在发现一组具有独特特征的高性能解决方案。QD方法在许多领域，包括机器人学，尤其是在发现适应性损伤的行动控制器方面，最近取得了成功。然而，尽管许多感兴趣的任务是多智能体的，但大多数现有工作都集中在单智能体环境中。为此，我们介绍了Mix-ME，这是一种基于多智能体的新型MAP-Elites算法，它通过将来自不同团队的智能体混合在一起形成新的解决方案。我们在多个部分可观察的连续控制任务上评估了所提出的方法。评估结果表明，这些多智能体方法可以提供更好的性能和多样性。",
