    "translated_abstract": "数据驱动的流体流动和温度分布预测在海洋和航空航天工程中得到了广泛的研究，并最近展示了其实时预测的潜力。然而，通常需要大量高保真度数据来描述和准确预测复杂的物理信息，而在现实中，由于高成本实验/计算，只有有限的高保真度数据可用。因此，本文提出了一种基于傅里叶神经算子的多保真度学习方法，在传递学习范式下，联合丰富的低保真度数据和有限的高保真度数据。首先，作为一个分辨率不变的算子，傅里叶神经算子首先被成功应用于直接集成多保真度数据，可以同时利用稀缺的高保真度数据和丰富的低保真度数据。然后，通过提取丰富的低保真度数据，为当前任务开发传递学习框架，可以帮助增强有限的高保真度数据的学习能力。实验结果表明，该方法可以通过更少的高保真度数据实现更准确的流体流动和温度场预测，并且优于许多最先进的方法。",
