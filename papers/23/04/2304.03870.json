    "abstract": "Selective prediction aims to learn a reliable model that abstains from making predictions when the model uncertainty is high. These predictions can then be deferred to a human expert for further evaluation. In many real-world scenarios, however, the distribution of test data is different from the training data.

Active learning circumvents this difficulty by only querying the most informative examples and, in several cases, has been shown to lower the overall labeling effort. In this work, we bridge the gap between selective prediction and active learning, proposing a new learning paradigm called active selective prediction which learns to query more informative samples from the shifted target domain while increasing accuracy and coverage. For this new problem, we propose a simple but effective solution, ASPEST, that trains ensembles of model snapshots",

    "translated_abstract": "选择性预测旨在学习一个可靠的模型，当模型不确定性很高时，可以避免进行预测。随后，可以将这些预测推迟给人类专家进行进一步评估。然而，在许多实际场景中，测试数据的分布与训练数据不同。这导致更不准确的预测，需要增加人工标注，这在许多场景中都是困难和昂贵的。主动学习通过仅查询最信息量丰富的示例来避免这种困难，并且在多个案例中已被证明可以降低总体的标注工作。在这项工作中，我们弥合了选择性预测和主动学习之间的差距，提出了一种新的学习范式，称为主动选择性预测（active selective prediction），它可以在增加准确性和覆盖率的同时在转移目标领域中学习查询更多有信息的样本。对于这个新问题，我们提出了一个简单但有效的解决方案ASPEST，它训练模型快照的集合。",
