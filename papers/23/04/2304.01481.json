    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)在处理复杂的语言任务上表现出色，引发了对它们能力本质的激烈辩论。不同于人类，这些模型只能从文本数据中学习语言，没有与真实世界的直接交互。尽管如此，它们能够生成关于各种话题似乎有意义的文本。这一印象深刻的成就重新引起了对经典“符号接地问题”的关注，这个问题质疑了经典符号AI系统的内部表示和输出能否具有内在意义。与这些系统不同，现代LLMs是计算向量而不是符号的人工神经网络。然而，这样的系统也有类似的问题，我们称之为向量接地问题。本文有两个主要目标。首先，我们区分了生物或人工系统中内部表示可以接地的各种方式，确定了五个不同的概念",
