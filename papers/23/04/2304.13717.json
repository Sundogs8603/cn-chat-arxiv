Classical association rule mining algorithms have several limitations, especially with regards to their high execution times and number of rules produced. Over the past decade, neural network solutions have been used to solve various optimization problems, such as classification, regression or clustering.

    "translated_abstract": "关联规则挖掘是数据挖掘中研究最广泛的领域之一，应用领域从杂货篮问题到可解释的分类系统均有涉及。然而，传统的关联规则挖掘算法存在多个限制，特别是执行时间和生成规则数方面。近十年来，神经网络已被用于解决各种优化问题，如分类、回归或聚类。尽管如此，在挖掘关联规则方面仍然没有有效的神经网络解决方案。本文提出了一种基于自编码器的关联规则挖掘算法ARM-AE，并以三个分类数据集为例将其与FP-Growth和NSGAII进行了比较。结果表明，我们的算法在保持所产生的规则集质量的同时，挖掘出高支持度和置信度规则集，并具有比传统方法更好的执行时间。",
