    "translated_abstract": "依赖长度极小化原则旨在把句子中语法关联的单词放在接近的位置，被认为对于有效的沟通来说，这种原则在塑造人类语言结构时普遍起作用。然而，人类语言系统中应用依赖长度极小化的程度尚未得到完全理解。在句子中，长时限词元放在短时限词元之前，短时限词元放在长时限词元之前已知可以最小化句子的整体依赖长度。在本研究中，我们测试了一种假设：在华语（一种SOV语言）中，将只有最短的前置成分放置在主谓动词旁边可以解释词序偏好，而不是全局最小化依赖长度。我们将此方法描述为最小化努力策略，因为这是一种成本有效的方法，可以缩短动词和其前置依赖之间的所有依赖。因此，这种方法符合有限理性的观点。",
