    "translated_abstract": "阅读时的眼动揭示了阅读者的认知过程和所阅读文本的特征。因此，阅读中扫视路径的分析已引起各个领域的关注，涵盖了从认知科学到语言学和计算机科学。然而，模拟阅读时人类的扫视路径的主要挑战在于它们是由双序列组成的：单词按照语言的语法规则排序，而注视则按照时间顺序排序。人类并不严格按左到右的顺序阅读，而是跳过或重复注视单词，并倒退到以前的单词，语言序列和时间序列的对齐并不容易。本文开发了Eyettention，这是第一个同时处理语言序列和时间序列的双序列模型。",
    "tldr": "Eyettention是第一个同时处理语言序列和时间序列的阅读模型，可以更准确地模拟阅读者的扫视路径，对机器学习的自然语言处理模型具有借鉴意义。",
