    "abstract": "With the increasing number of clinical trial reports generated every day, it is becoming hard to keep up with novel discoveries that inform evidence-based healthcare recommendations. To help automate this process and assist medical experts, NLP solutions are being developed. This motivated the SemEval-2023 Task 7, where the goal was to develop an NLP system for two tasks: evidence retrieval and natural language inference from clinical trial data. In this paper, we describe our two developed systems. The first one is a pipeline system that models the two tasks separately, while the second one is a joint system that learns the two tasks simultaneously with a shared representation and a multi-task learning approach. The final system combines their outputs in an ensemble system. We formalize the models, present their characteristics and challenges, and provide an analysis of achieved results.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着每天产生的临床试验报告数量增加，跟进告知基于证据的医疗建议的新发现变得越来越难。为了帮助自动化这一过程并协助医疗专家，正在开发NLP解决方案。这激发了SemEval-2023任务7，该任务的目标是开发一个NLP系统，以处理从临床试验数据中提取证据和进行自然语言推理的两个任务。本文介绍我们开发的两个系统。第一个是流水线系统，单独建模了这两个任务，而第二个是联合系统，采用共享表示和多任务学习方法同时学习这两个任务。最终系统将它们的输出合并为一个集成系统。我们规范化模型，介绍其特点和挑战，并对实现的结果进行分析。",
