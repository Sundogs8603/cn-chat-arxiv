    "translated_abstract": "个性化推荐系统渗透到现代生活中，塑造了我们读什么媒体和消费什么产品。驱动此类系统的算法往往包括基于监督学习的启发式算法，例如具有多种启发式选择的潜在因素模型。同时，有关推荐的理论处理通常涉及问题的决策理论性质，包括通过多臂赌博机（MAB）框架平衡探索和开发的需要。然而，基于MAB的方法严重依赖于人类偏好的假设。这些偏好假设很少使用人员研究进行测试，部分原因是缺乏公开可用的工具包来进行这些研究。在这项工作中，我们在漫画推荐MAB设置中与众包工作者进行研究。每个机器臂表示一个漫画类别，用户在每次推荐后提供反馈。我们检查了关键MAB假设的有效性，即人类偏好是时空具有静态性，并且可以建模为潜在收益分布的嘈杂实现。我们的研究结果挑战了这些假设，强调了需要进行更多关于MAB推荐中这些假设的实证工作。",
