    "translated_abstract": "高维数据的降维和可视化一直是一个具有挑战性的问题。现代高通量技术产生了多种视图的新的高维数据集，这些数据集包含了新的数据类型。对这些数据集的可视化需要适当的方法，可以在不影响数据中的局部和全局结构的情况下发现数据中的隐藏模式。然而，能够实现这个任务的方法非常少。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一种新的无监督深度神经网络模型NeuroDAVIS，用于数据可视化。NeuroDAVIS能够从数据中提取重要特征，而不需要假设任何数据分布，并在更低的维度上进行有效的可视化。理论上证明了高维数据的邻近关系在低维空间中得到了保留。NeuroDAVIS的性能已在各种合成和实际数据集上进行了评估。",
