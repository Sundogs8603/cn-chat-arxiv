    "abstract": "Deaf individuals confront significant communication obstacles on a daily basis. Their inability to hear makes it difficult for them to communicate with those who do not understand sign language. Moreover, it presents difficulties in educational, occupational, and social contexts. By providing alternative communication channels, technology can play a crucial role in overcoming these obstacles. One such technology that can facilitate communication between deaf and hearing individuals is sign language recognition. We will create a robust system for sign language recognition in order to convert Indian Sign Language to text or speech. We will evaluate the proposed system and compare CNN and LSTM models. Since there are both static and gesture sign languages, a robust model is required to distinguish between them. In this study, we discovered that a CNN model captures letters and characters for recognition of static sign language better than an LSTM model, but it outperforms CNN by monitorin",

    "translated_abstract": "聋哑人在日常生活中面临着沟通障碍。他们听不到声音，与不懂手语的人沟通困难，从而在教育、职业和社交等方面遇到困难。技术可以提供替代的沟通渠道，发挥关键作用。一种有助于聋人与听力正常人进行沟通的技术是手语识别。我们将创建一个强大的手语识别系统，将印度手语转换为文本或语音。我们将评估所提出的系统，并比较CNN和LSTM模型。由于存在静态和动态手语，因此需要一个强大的模型来区分它们。在本研究中，我们发现CNN模型比LSTM模型更能捕捉字母和字符，更适用于静态手语的识别，但通过监控手势，它又超越了CNN。",
