    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）展示了惊人的零样本泛化能力：最先进的聊天机器人可以提供对许多日常生活中常见问题的合理答案。然而，迄今为止，LLM不能可靠地解决长时程规划问题。相比之下，经典规划器一旦以格式化的方式提供问题，则可以使用高效的搜索算法快速识别正确或甚至最优的计划。为了综合两者的优势，本论文引入了LLM+P，这是第一个将经典规划器的优点融入LLM的框架。LLM+P接收一个计划问题的自然语言描述，然后以自然语言返回解决该问题的正确（或最优）计划。LLM+P首先将语言描述转换为用规划领域定义语言（PDDL）编写的文件，然后利用经典规划器快速找到解决方案，最后将找到的解决方案翻译回自然语言。",

LLM+P solves planning problems by first converting natural language descriptions into files written in the planning domain definition language (PDDL), then using classical planners to quickly find a solution, and lastly translating the found solution back into natural language. The goal is to combine the advantages of LLMs' zero-shot generalization abilities with classical planners' efficient search algorithms to enable LLMs to solve long-horizon planning problems."
