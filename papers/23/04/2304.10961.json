    "translated_abstract": "在智能交通系统中，缺失数据是比较常见和不可避免的情况。而完整和有效的交通速度数据对于智能交通系统非常重要。潜变量分解张量模型是解决缺失交通数据恢复问题最有吸引力的方法之一，因为它的可扩展性。该模型通常通过随机梯度下降(SGD)求解器实现优化，但基于SGD求解的潜变量分解张量模型收敛速度较慢。为了解决这个问题，本文将比例积分微分(PID)控制器的独特优势融入Tucker分解的潜变量分解张量模型中。它采用了两个思想：a)采用Tucker分解构建一个用于实现更好的恢复精度的潜变量分解张量模型。b)基于PID控制理论的调整实例误差融入SGD求解器中，从而有效提高收敛速度。我们在两个主要城市交通道路速度数据集上进行的实验研究表明，本文提出的PID控制器Tucker分解模型具有更好的性能表现。",
