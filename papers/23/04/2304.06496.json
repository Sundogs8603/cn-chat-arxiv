    "translated_abstract": "脑电图（EEG）是情绪识别的客观工具，并显示出良好的性能。然而，标签稀缺问题是该领域的主要挑战，限制了基于EEG的情绪识别的广泛应用。本文提出了一种新的半监督学习框架（EEGMatch），以利用标记和未标记的EEG数据。首先，开发了一种基于EEG-Mixup数据增强方法，以生成更多用于模型学习的有效样本。其次，提出了一种半监督的两步成对学习方法，将原型式和实例化式成对学习连接起来，其中原型式成对学习衡量EEG数据与每个情感类别的原型表示之间的全局关系，而实例化式成对学习捕捉EEG数据之间的局部内在关系。第三，引入了一种半监督的多域自适应，以对齐多个域（标记的和未标记的数据集）之间的数据表示。实验结果表明，EEGMatch在情绪识别任务中表现出比现有的半监督方法更高的准确性和稳定性。",
