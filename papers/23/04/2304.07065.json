    "abstract": "Entity alignment (EA) aims to find equivalent entities in different knowledge graphs (KGs). State-of-the-art EA approaches generally use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to encode entities.

To enhance the usability of GNN-based EA models in real-world applications, we present SEA, a scalable entity alignment system that enables to (i) train large-scale GNNs for EA, (ii) speed up the normalization and the evaluation process, and (iii) report clear results for users to estimate different models and parameter settings. SEA can be run on a computer with merely one graphic card. Moreover, SEA encompasses six state-of-the-art EA models and provides access for users to quickly establish and evaluate their own models.

    "translated_abstract": "实体对齐旨在在不同知识图谱中找到相应的实体。现有的实体对齐方法通常使用图神经网络来编码实体。然而，大多数方法都是在全批量模式下训练模型和评估结果，这使得实体对齐在大规模数据集上无法扩展。为了增强基于图神经网络的实体对齐模型在实际应用中的可用性，我们提出了一个可扩展的实体对齐系统SEA。它能够(i)训练大规模的图神经网络用于实体对齐，(ii)加速归一化和评估过程，(iii)为用户提供清晰的结果以估计不同的模型和参数设置。SEA只需要一个图形卡就可以运行。此外，SEA包括六个最先进的实体对齐模型，并为用户提供快速建立和评估自己模型的方法。因此，SEA允许用户在不涉及复杂实现的情况下执行实体对齐，如负抽样和GPU加速。",
