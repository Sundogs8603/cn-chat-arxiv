    "translated_abstract": "尽管在行为变革的eHealth应用中非常普遍，但劝说信息对行为的影响往往很小。被劝说者的条件或状态（例如信心，知识和动机）和特征（例如性别，年龄和个性）是选择劝说信息更有效算法的两个有前途的组成部分。然而，至今还不太清楚在进行劝说尝试后，特别是在长期内，考虑这些组件能否很好地预测行为。由于收集许多算法组件的数据是昂贵的并且会给用户带来负担，因此欢迎更好地了解个别组件在实践中的影响，这有助于在使用哪些组件上做出明智的决策。因此，我们进行了一项纵向研究，在这项研究中，虚拟教练劝说671名日常吸烟者做准备活动，如设想自己所希望的未来自我，以准备戒烟和变得更加身体活跃。",
