    "translated_abstract": "深度估计在计算机视觉中有广泛的应用，如目标跟踪、增强现实和自动驾驶汽车。单目深度估计的目标是预测深度图，给定一个二维单目 RGB 图像作为输入。传统的深度估计方法基于深度线索，使用了诸如极线几何等概念。随着卷积神经网络的发展，深度估计已经取得了巨大的进展。在这个项目中，我们的目标是探索可能的深度估计模型的扩展，以及是否可以进一步提高性能度量。在更广泛的意义上，我们正在考虑实现姿态估计、高效亚像素卷积插值、语义分割估计技术，以进一步增强我们的提出的架构，并提供细粒度和更全局一致的深度图预测。我们还计划放弃相机内参数，并调查基于自监督学习的深度估计，其中训练数据是从单目 RGB 图像自动生成的，无需地面真实深度图。",
