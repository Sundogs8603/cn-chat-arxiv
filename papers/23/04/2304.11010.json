    "abstract": "We develop a formalism for reasoning about trading on decentralized exchanges on blockchains and a formulation of a particular form of maximal extractable value (MEV) that represents the total arbitrage opportunity extractable from on-chain liquidity. We use this formalism to prove that for blockchains with deterministic block times whose liquidity pools satisfy some natural properties that are satisfied by pools in practice, this form of MEV is invariant under changes to the ordering mechanism of the blockchain and distribution of block times. We do this by characterizing the MEV as the profit of a particularly simple arbitrage strategy when left uncontested. These results can inform design of blockchain protocols by ruling out designs aiming to increase trading opportunity by changing the ordering mechanism or shortening block times.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种形式化推理去研究基于区块链的去中心化交易，并给出了一种特定形式的最大可提取价值（MEV）的表达式，该表达式代表从链上流动性中可提取的总套利机会。我们使用这种形式化推理来证明，在具有确定性区块时间且其流动性池满足实践中满足的一些自然特性的区块链中，这种MEV在区块排序机制和区块时间分布发生变化时是不变的。我们通过将MEV表征为一种特别简单的套利策略获得的利润，证明了这一结果当无人竞争时的结果可以为设计区块链协议提供指导，防止设计会改变排序机制或缩短区块时间以增加交易机会。",
