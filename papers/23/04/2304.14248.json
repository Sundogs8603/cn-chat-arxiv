The deformation in the metric illustrated in this paper is mathematically straightforward and unavoidable in the general case, and it is only one of several similar effects.

    "translated_abstract": "许多机器学习技术尝试通过测量不需要对物理现象或测量设备进行显式建模的低维流形结构来推断潜在物理现象的低维流形结构，这篇论文提出了关于测量几何和底层现象几何之间差异的警示故事。在普通情况下，这篇论文所展示的度量形变在数学上是直接而不可避免的，并且它只是数个类似效应中的一个。虽然这并不总是出现问题，但我们提供了一个标准且无害数据处理过程的例子，其中这种影响导致对一个看似简单的问题给出了错误的答案。尽管我们关注流形学习，但这些问题广泛适用于降维和无监督学习领域。",
