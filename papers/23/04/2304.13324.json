    "abstract": "We investigated the potential and limitations of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in reflecting the authors' cognitive processes through creative expression. The focus is on the AI-generated artwork's ability to understand human intent (alignment) and visually represent emotions based on criteria such as creativity, aesthetic, novelty, amusement, and depth. Results show a preference for images based on the descriptions of the authors' emotions over the main events. We also found that images that overrepresent specific elements or stereotypes negatively impact AI alignment. Our findings suggest that AI could facilitate creativity and the self-expression of emotions. Our research framework with generative AIs can help design AI-based interventions in related fields (e.g., mental health education, therapy, and counseling).",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究调查了生成型人工智能（AI）在通过创造性表达反映作者的认知过程中的潜力和局限性。重点在于AI生成的艺术作品理解人类意图（对齐）和根据创意、美感、新颖性、娱乐性和深度等标准视觉化表现情感的能力。结果表明，基于作者情感描述的图像在事件中的表现方面更受欢迎。我们还发现，过分强调某些元素或刻板印象的图像会对AI的对齐产生负面影响。我们的研究结果表明，AI可以促进创造力和情感的自我表达。我们的研究框架可用于设计相关领域（例如心理健康教育、治疗和咨询）中基于AI的干预。",
