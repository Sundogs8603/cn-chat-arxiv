The training enforces dynamical invariants--such as the Lyapunov exponent spectrum and fractal dimension--in the systems of interest, enabling longer and more stable forecasts when operating with limited data. The technique is demonstrated in detail using the recurrent neural network architecture of reservoir computing. Results are given for the Lorenz 1996 chaotic dynamical system and a spectral quasi-geostrophic model, both typical test cases for numerical weather prediction.",
