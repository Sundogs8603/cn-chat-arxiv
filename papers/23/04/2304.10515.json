Our work draws inspiration from recent studies suggesting that artificial and biological neural networks may have common principles in optimizing network architecture. We implement the core-periphery principle in the design of network wiring patterns and the sparsification of the convolution operation.

    "translated_abstract": "卷积神经网络(CNN)的发展很大程度上归因于其架构设计，即网络布线模式。神经结构搜索(NAS)通过自动化搜索最优网络架构推进了这一进展，但所得到的网络实例在不同任务中可能无法泛化。为了解决这个问题，探索跨任务通用的网络设计原则是更实际的解决方案。本研究基于人脑网络的核心-周边属性探索了一种新颖的类脑设计原则，以指导CNN的设计。我们的工作从最近的研究中汲取灵感，这些研究表明人工和生物神经网络在优化网络架构方面可能具有共同的原则。我们在网络布线模式的设计和卷积操作的稀疏化中实现了核心-周边原则。结果，使用核心-周边原则指导的CNN (CP-CNN)在各种视觉任务上得到了良好的表现。",
