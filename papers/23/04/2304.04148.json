    "translated_abstract": "子人群偏移在许多现实世界的应用中普遍存在，指的是训练集和测试集包含相同的子人群组，但具有不同的子人群比例。忽略子人群偏移可能导致显著的性能下降和公平性问题。重要性评估权重是处理子人群偏移的经典和有效方法。然而，最近的研究表明，大多数这些方法在应用于具有任意拟合训练样本能力的超参数化神经网络时，无法改善性能。在本文中，我们提出一种简单而实用的框架，称为加权mixup（RMIX），通过对“混合”样本进行重要性加权来减轻超参数化模型中的过拟合问题。由于利用mixup中的重加权，RMIX允许模型更多地探索少数样本的邻域空间，从而获得更稳健的模型。",
