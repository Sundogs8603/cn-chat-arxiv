    "translated_abstract": "自动生成高质量的逐步解决数学单词问题的解决方案在教育中有许多应用。最近，将大型语言模型（LLM）与外部工具结合使用以执行复杂的推理和计算已成为解决数学单词问题的有前途的方向，但先前的方法（如程序辅助语言模型（PAL））对于需要陈述性推理的问题具有偏见，而对于简单的过程问题则不太有效。我们提出了一种方法，将一种可以将单词问题逐步正式化为一组变量和方程式的LLM与外部符号求解器相结合，以解决方程。我们的方法在GSM8K数学单词问题基准测试上实现了与原始PAL相当的准确度，而在ALGEBRA上则明显优于PAL，该数据集从代数教科书中提取更具挑战性的单词问题。我们的工作突出了在解决数学单词问题时使用声明性和逐步表示的好处。",
