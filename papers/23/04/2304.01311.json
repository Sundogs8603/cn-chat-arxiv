    "translated_abstract": "本研究通过对19位来自企业和学术环境下、涉及各种用例的知识图谱（KG）实践者的访谈，提出了KG实践者在创建、探索和分析KG时遇到的重要挑战，这些挑战可以通过可视化设计来缓解。我们的研究发现，KG实践者可以分为三类：KG构建者、分析师和消费者，每个人都有自己的专业知识和需求。我们发现，KG构建者可以从架构执行程序中获益，而KG分析师需要提供中间查询结果的可自定义查询构建器。对于KG消费者，我们确定节点链接图的效力不足，并需要定制的领域特定可视化来促进KG的采用和理解。最后，我们发现，在实践中有效地实施KG需要不仅技术上的，还有社交上的解决方案，而这些解决方案目前并未被当前的工具、技术和最佳实践所考虑。",
