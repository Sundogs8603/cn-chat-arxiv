The neural network training is done by minimizing loss functions encoding Yang-Baxter equation, regularity and other model-specific restrictions such as hermiticity.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的神经网络架构，可以：i）输出给定量子可积自旋链的R矩阵，ii）在满足一定的对称性或其他限制的假设下搜索可积哈密顿量和相应的R矩阵，iii）探索围绕已学会的模型的哈密顿量空间，并重构它们所属的可积自旋链家族。神经网络训练通过最小化编码杨-巴克斯特方程、正则性和其他特定于模型的限制例如厄米性的损失函数完成。全纯性是通过激活函数的选择来实现的。我们展示了我们的神经网络在二维差分型自旋链上的工作。特别地，我们重构了所有14个类别的R矩阵。我们还展示了它作为“探索器”的有用性，扫描特定的哈密顿量子空间并在聚类后识别可积类。最后的策略可以在未来用于建立更复杂的模型。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel neural network architecture that can generate R-matrix for a given quantum integrable spin chain, search for an integrable Hamiltonian and corresponding R-matrix, and explore the space of Hamiltonians to reconstruct the family of integrable spin chains. The network is trained by minimizing loss functions based on the Yang-Baxter equation, regularity, and other model-specific restrictions. The network has been applied to two-dimensional spin chains and demonstrated its usefulness."
