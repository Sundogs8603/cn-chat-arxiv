    "translated_abstract": "疼痛是访问医疗资源的常见原因，并且是一个研究领域，特别是在与心理健康的重叠方面。心理健康电子健康记录是研究此重叠的良好数据来源。然而，疼痛的大量信息保存在这些记录的自由文本中，由于其歧义性，疼痛的提及呈现出独特的自然语言处理问题。本项目使用匿名的心理健康电子健康记录数据库中的数据。利用这些数据训练基于机器学习的分类算法，将句子分类为讨论患者疼痛或不讨论。这将有助于从大型数据库中提取相关疼痛信息，并将这些输出用于进一步研究疼痛和心理健康。共手动三重注释了1,985份文件，以创建黄金标准训练数据，并用于训练三种常用的分类算法。最佳模型的F1分数为0.787。结果证明了使用自然语言处理识别心理健康电子健康记录中的疼痛提及的可行性，这可以改善对疼痛和心理健康之间关系的理解。",
