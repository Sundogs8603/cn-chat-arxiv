    "translated_abstract": "随着转型过程的不断深入，德国劳动力市场对职业培训、再培训和继续教育高度依赖。为了匹配培训寻求者和提供者，本研究提出了一种新的方法，通过对德国培训提供和广告中的教育和培训准入进行自动检测。我们特别关注以下几个方面：（a）普通学校和教育学位以及毕业证书，（b）专业经验，（c）以前的学徒培训和（d）由德国联邦劳动机构提供的技能列表。该新方法结合了几种方法：首先，我们提供了教育同义词的映射，将不同的资格证书组合并添加过时的术语。其次，我们提供基于规则的匹配，以确定专业经验或学徒培训的需求。但是，由于数据架构不兼容或非标准化要求（例如初始测试或面试），并不是所有准入要求都能够匹配。尽管如此，我们仍能使用这些检测到的准入需求来帮助更好地匹配培训寻求者和培训提供商。",
