    "translated_abstract": "本文针对心电图(ECG)心律失常检测问题，系统地研究了自监督学习(Self-Supervised Learning, SSL)方法的有效性。我们首先对三个常用的ECG心律失常数据集进行了分布分析，并进行了综合性实验，使用不同增强和参数评估了各种SSL方法（如SimCRL、BYOL和SwAV）在ECG表征学习方面的有效性。实验结果表明，SwAV方法表现最佳。我们进一步进行了针对In-Distribution (ID)和Out-of-Distribution (OOD) ECG数据的交叉数据集训练和测试实验，结果表明SSL方法，特别是SwAV，在ECG表征学习方面具有很高的竞争力，并且对不同种类的ECG数据具有较强的鲁棒性，从而有望在大规模和多样化人群中检测心律失常。",
