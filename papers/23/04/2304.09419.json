    "abstract": "We consider linear orders of finite alternatives that are constructed by aggregating the preferences of individuals. We focus on a linear order that is consistent with the collective preference relation, which is constructed by one of the supermajority rules and modified using two procedures if there exist some cycles. One modification procedure uses the transitive closure, and the other uses the Suzumura consistent closure. We derive two sets of linear orders that are consistent with the (modified) collective preference relations formed by any of the supermajority rules. These sets of linear orders are closely related to those obtained through Tideman's ranked pairs method and the Schulze method. Finally, we consider two social choice correspondences whose output is one of the sets introduced above, and show that the correspondences satisfy the four properties: the extended Condorcet principle, the Pareto principle, the independence of clones, and the reversal symmetry.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑通过个体偏好的聚合来构建有限选项的线性排序。我们关注的是与集体偏好关系一致的线性排序，该线性排序是由超过半数规则之一构建的，并在存在循环时使用两种程序进行修改。一种修改程序使用传递闭包，另一种使用铃木村一致性闭包。我们得出两组线性排序，这些线性排序与通过Tideman的排名对方法和Schulze方法获得的排序密切相关。最后，我们考虑了两个社会决策对应，其输出是上述引入的一个集合，并表明这些对应满足四个属性：扩展的Condorcet原则，Pareto原则，克隆的独立性和翻转对称性。",
