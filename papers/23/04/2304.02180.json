We develop a model that accounts for the interaction between these two markets, estimating the conditional dependence between variables using the concept of conditional elicitability. Furthermore, we pose an optimal execution problem where the agent hides their orders by controlling the rate at which they trade. We do so without approximating the market dynamics. The resulting dynamic programming equation is not analytically tractable, therefore, we employ the deep Galerkin method to solve it.

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了在常数函数市场制造商(CFMMs)和集中式交易所中优化交易策略的方法。我们开发了一个模型，考虑了这两个市场之间的互动，使用条件可激发性的概念估计变量之间的条件依赖关系。此外，我们提出了一个最优执行问题，其中代理通过控制交易速率来隐藏订单。我们这样做时没有近似市场动态。由此产生的动态规划方程不是解析可追踪的，因此我们采用深度Galerkin方法来解决它。最后，我们进行了数字实验，并说明最优策略不会容易受到价格滑移影响，且优于幼稚的策略。",
    "tldr": "本文利用深度学习方法，建立了一个考虑到自动市场制造商和中心化交易所互动的模型，实现了在不使用市场动态近似的前提下，通过优化隐藏订单的交易速率，优化交易策略，该策略可减少价格滑动，跑赢无脑策略。",

The proposed optimal execution problem hides orders by controlling the rate at which they trade, without approximating the market dynamics. Numerical experiments show that the resulting strategy reduces price slippage and outperforms na\\\"ive strategies."
