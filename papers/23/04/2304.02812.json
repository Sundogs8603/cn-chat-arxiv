    "translated_abstract": "语言语用学表明，对话中的基本语言行为可以限制每个回合中适当的响应类型。在生成对话回复时，神经对话代理难以产生不同的响应。目前，使用自动度量衡来评估对话的多样性，但基本语言行为并未考虑这些度量标准。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了实用适当性多样性的概念，这定义为一个对话中产生和限制多个不同响应的程度。使用人类创建的多个响应数据集，我们发现基本语言行为提供了多个下一步响应的多样性信号。在此基础上，我们提出了一个新的人类评估任务，即创意作家预测对话启发多种不同响应的程度。我们的研究发现，作家的判断与实用适当性多样性测量相一致，并且这个新的度量标准比当前的多样性度量标准更好地指示一个对话的质量。",

The study shows that speech acts provide a signal for the diversity of the set of next responses. Also, a new human evaluation task is proposed to assess the extent to which conversations inspire the creation of multiple diverse responses. Pragmatically Appropriate Diversity is a better indicator of conversational quality than current diversity metrics."
