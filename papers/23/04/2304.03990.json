    "translated_abstract": "在比较两种分类算法的任务中，广泛使用的McNemar检验旨在推断出两种分类算法的错误率之间存在重大差异。然而，传统的McNemar检验的功率通常不太理想，因为测试中的留置（HO）方法仅使用一次训练验证拆分，这通常会产生高度变化的错误率估计。相反，交叉验证（CV）方法在多次重复HO方法的基础上产生稳定的估计，因此CV方法在提高McNemar检验功率方面具有巨大优势。在所有类型的CV方法中，块正则化5×2 CV（BCV）在许多先前的研究中已经显示出比其他CV方法在算法比较任务中更为优越，因为5×2 BCV可以通过使所有训练集之间的重叠记录数规范化来产生高质量的误差率估计。",
