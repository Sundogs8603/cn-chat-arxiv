    "abstract": "We demonstrate that gauge-equivariant pooling and unpooling layers can perform as well as traditional restriction and prolongation layers in multigrid preconditioner models for lattice QCD. These layers introduce a gauge degree of freedom on the coarse grid, allowing for the use of explicitly gauge-equivariant layers on the coarse grid. We investigate the construction of coarse-grid gauge fields and study their efficiency in the preconditioner model. We show that a combined multigrid neural network using a Galerkin construction for the coarse-grid gauge field eliminates critical slowing down.",
