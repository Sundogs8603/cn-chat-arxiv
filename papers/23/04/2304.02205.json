    "translated_abstract": "学生建模是智能教育中推断学生学习特征的一项基本任务。尽管从知识跟踪和认知诊断的最近尝试提出了几个有希望改进当前模型可用性和有效性的方向，但现有公共数据集仍然不足以满足这些潜在解决方案的需求，因为它们忽略了完整的练习情境、细粒度的概念和认知标签。本文介绍了 MoocRadar，它是一个由 2,513 个练习问题、5,600 个知识概念和超过 1200 万行为记录组成的细粒度、多方面的知识库。具体而言，我们提出了一个框架，以保证细粒度概念和认知标签的高质量和全面性注释。统计和实验结果表明，我们的数据集为未来改进智能教育模型提供了一个基础。",
