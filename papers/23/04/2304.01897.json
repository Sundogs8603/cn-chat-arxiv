To represent the posting behaviors and social relations, the graph convolutional neural networks are applied to model influencers with heterogeneous networks during different historical periods. By learning the network structure with the embedded node features, InfluencerRank can derive informative representations for influencers at each period.

    "translated_abstract": "随着影响者在社交媒体营销中扮演重要角色，企业增加了影响者营销的预算。雇用有效的影响者在社交影响者营销中至关重要，但是在数亿社交媒体用户中找到合适的影响者是具有挑战性的。本文提出了InfluencerRank，它基于影响者的发布行为和社交关系评估影响者的有效性。为了表示发布行为和社交关系，应用图卷积神经网络来在不同的历史时间段内对具有异构网络的影响者进行建模。通过学习嵌入式节点特征的网络结构，InfluencerRank可以在每个时间段为影响者派生信息丰富的表示。最终，一个注意力循环神经网络通过捕捉影响者表示的动态知识，区分高效的影响者和其他影响者。",
