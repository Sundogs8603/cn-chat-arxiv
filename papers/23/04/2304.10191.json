    "translated_abstract": "脉冲神经网络(SNN)作为生物神经元稀疏和事件驱动通信模型的模拟器已引起关注，并因此在神经形态学硬件中显示出越来越多的节能应用前景。与经典人工神经网络(ANNs)一样，预测不确定性对于高风险应用（如自动驾驶车辆、医学诊断和高频交易）的决策非常重要。然而，关于SNNs中的不确定性估计的讨论很少，而人工神经网络(ANNs)中的不确定性估计方法不能直接应用于SNNs。在这里，我们提出了一种基于MC-dropout的脉冲神经网络不确定性估计的高效方法。我们的方法利用SNNs的时间步机制，以一种计算高效的方式实现MC-dropout，不会在训练和推断过程中引入重大开销，同时展示了高准确率和不确定性质量。",
