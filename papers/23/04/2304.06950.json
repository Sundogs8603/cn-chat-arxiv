    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种方法来同时估计极值回归模型中的尾部和阈值参数。该标准模型在金融领域中被用于评估市场变量对投资车辆（如避险基金）的极端损失分布的影响。然而，一个主要的局限性是需要提前选择一个阈值，在该阈值以下的数据将被丢弃，导致估计效率低下。为了解决这些问题，我们通过辅助剪接密度扩展了尾部回归模型以用于非尾部观测，使得阈值可以自动选择。然后，我们应用了人工截断的似然贡献机制来减少估计阶段的特定问题。我们在一个模拟研究中展示了我们的方法在推断方面优于传统的峰值超过阈值方法。在实证方面，我们利用1994年1月至2018年12月的1,484只避险基金的汇总回报，研究避险基金尾部风险的决定因素。",
