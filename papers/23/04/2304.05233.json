    "translated_abstract": "为了在内窥镜诊断中应用人工智能技术，我们需要克服有限注释问题。这些限制是由医学领域的高保密性和需求导致的，需要从专家获取密集的，昂贵的医学数据标注过程。在计算机视觉中，由于生成对抗网络(GAN)和扩散概率模型(DPM)的进展，图像合成近年来有了显著的贡献。新型 DPM 在文本、图像和视频生成任务中的表现优于 GAN。因此，本研究提出了一种条件 DPM 框架，以生成给定的生成分割掩模所限制的合成 GI 息肉图像。我们的实验结果表明，我们的系统可以生成无限数量的具有相应肉瘤真实标注掩模的高保真合成肉瘤图像。为了测试所生成的数据的实用性，我们训练了二值图像分割模型。",
