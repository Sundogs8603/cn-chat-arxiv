    "translated_abstract": "通过自回归分布，已经实现了对于连续时间几何结构（如手写、草图、图画等）的生成建模。然而，这种严格有序的离散分解无法捕捉手写数据的关键属性——由于单向可见性（因果性），它无法建立整体的时间概念理解，因此在建模时将时间数据建模为固定采样率的离散标记序列，而未能捕获真正的基础概念。在本文中，我们介绍了一个名为“去噪弥散概率模型”（DDPMs）的强大模型类，专门为手写数据解决这些缺陷。我们的模型名为“ChiroDiff”，是非自回归的，学习捕捉整体概念，因此在更高的时间采样率下保持弹性至少有限。此外，我们展示了许多重要的下游实用程序（如条件采样、创意混合）。",
