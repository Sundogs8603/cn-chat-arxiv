    "translated_abstract": "最近发展的图形对比学习（GCL）方法是比较同一个图形的两个不同的“视图”以学习节点/图形表示。这些方法的核心假设是通过图形增强，可以生成几个结构不同但语义相似的图形结构，因此原始和增强的图形/节点的身份标签应该是相同的。然而，在本文中，我们发现这个假设并不总是成立，例如分子图中对节点或边的任何扰动都会在一定程度上改变图形标签。因此，我们认为增强图形结构应该伴随着对对比损失使用的标签的适应。基于这个想法，我们提出了 ID-MixGCL，它允许同时调节输入图形和相应的身份标签，具有可控的改变程度，从而捕获细粒度的表示。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种基于身份混合的图形对比学习方法，旨在解决通过图形增强得到的不同但相似的图形结构和标签的不匹配问题，以实现更好的表示捕获。"
