    "abstract": "This research article analyzes the language used in the official statements released by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) after its scheduled meetings to gain insights into the impact of FOMC official statements on financial markets and economic forecasting. The study reveals that the FOMC is careful to avoid expressing emotion in their sentences and follows a set of templates to cover economic situations. The analysis employs advanced language modeling techniques such as VADER and FinBERT, and a trial test with GPT-4. The results show that FinBERT outperforms other techniques in predicting negative sentiment accurately. However, the study also highlights the challenges and limitations of using current NLP techniques to analyze FOMC texts and suggests the potential for enhancing language models and exploring alternative approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究论文分析了联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）在其定期会议后发布的官方声明中使用的语言，以获取有关FOMC官方声明对金融市场和经济预测的影响的见解。研究发现，FOMC小心避免在句子中表达情感，并遵循一套模板来覆盖经济情况。该分析采用了VADER和FinBERT等先进的语言建模技术，以及使用GPT-4的试验测试。结果表明，在准确预测负面情绪方面，FinBERT的表现优于其他技术。然而，研究还强调了使用当前NLP技术分析FOMC文本的挑战和限制，并建议增强语言模型并探索替代方法的潜力。",
