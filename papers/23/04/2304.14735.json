    "translated_abstract": "由于空间和时间的价格波动，在二手建筑设备的价格预测方面是一项具有挑战性的任务。因此，基于当前市场数据自动化预测过程具有极高的兴趣。即使将机器学习（ML）应用于这些数据是预测某些工具残值的一个有前途的方法，但由于中小型企业的ML专业知识不足，因此很难实现。为此，我们展示了用自动化机器学习（AutoML）解决方案代替手动创建的ML管道的可能性，这些解决方案可以自动生成底层管道。我们将AutoML方法与公司的领域知识相结合。基于CRISP-DM过程，我们将手动ML管道分为机器学习部分和非机器学习部分。为了考虑所有复杂的工业要求并展示我们新方法的适用性，我们设计了一种新的名为“方法评估”的度量标准。",
