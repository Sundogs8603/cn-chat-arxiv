    "translated_abstract": "医学成像系统经常通过客观或任务特定的图像质量（IQ）度量来评估和优化，以量化观察者在具体的临床任务上的表现。贝叶斯理想观察者（IO）的表现在所有观察者（数值或人类）中设定了一个上限，并已被提倡用作评估和优化医学成像系统效能的merit。然而，IO测试统计量对应于大多数情况下难以计算的似然比。以前曾提出过一种采用马尔科夫链蒙特卡罗（MCMC）技术的基于采样的方法来估计IO性能。然而，目前将MCMC方法应用于IO近似的情况仅限于少数情况，其中被成像对象的考虑分布可以用相对简单的随机对象模型（SOM）来描述。因此，有必要扩展领域，使其适用于更广泛的情况。",
