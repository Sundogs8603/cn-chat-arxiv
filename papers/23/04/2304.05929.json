    "translated_abstract": "康复研究专注于确定治疗干预的组成部分，这些组成部分导致恢复和康复的机制，以及最终最大化患者身体、心理和社交功能的最佳干预策略。传统的随机临床试验研究和确定新干预措施面临着很多挑战，如高昂的费用和时间承诺。观察性研究利用现有的临床数据观察干预效果在RCTs方面表现出了几个优点。电子健康记录（EHRs）成为进行观察性研究的日益重要的资源。为支持这些研究，我们开发了一个临床研究数据集ReDWINE（可通过信息学基础设施进行康复研究的康复数据集），将UPMC医疗保健系统收集的康复相关EHR数据转换为支持观察性健康数据科学和信息学（OHDSI）格式。我们还在ReDWINE中实现了一个文本分析系统，允许研究人员从临床笔记中搜索、注释和提取信息以支持研究问题。ReDWINE提供了丰富的数据元素，包括人口统计信息、诊断、程序、药物、实验室检测结果和生命体征。这些数据元素可用于回答有关康复和物理医学的研究问题。",
