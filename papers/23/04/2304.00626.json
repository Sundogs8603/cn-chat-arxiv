Based on the identification results, we propose two semiparametric estimators as well as a discretization-based estimator that does not require any nonparametric regressions. We establish their asymptotic normality, provide corresponding variance estimators, and demonstrate via simulations the good finite-sample performances of our proposed estimation and inference procedures. In particular, we find that the discretization-based estimator performs remarkably well in finite samples, while being very simple and fast to compute.",
