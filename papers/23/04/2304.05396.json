    "abstract": "Foundation models have taken over natural language processing and image generation domains due to the flexibility of prompting. With the recent introduction of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), this prompt-driven paradigm has entered image segmentation with a hitherto unexplored abundance of capabilities. The purpose of this paper is to conduct an initial evaluation of the out-of-the-box zero-shot capabilities of SAM for medical image segmentation, by evaluating its performance on an abdominal CT organ segmentation task, via point or bounding box based prompting. We show that SAM generalizes well to CT data, making it a potential catalyst for the advancement of semi-automatic segmentation tools for clinicians. We believe that this foundation model, while not reaching state-of-the-art segmentation performance in our investigations, can serve as a highly potent starting point for further adaptations of such models to the intricacies of the medical domain.

    "translated_abstract": "基础模型由于提示的灵活性已经占据了自然语言处理和图像生成领域。随着Segment Anything Model（SAM）的最近推出，这种提示驱动的范例已经进入了具有大量未开发能力的图像分割领域。本文的目的是通过评估SAM在腹部CT器官分割任务中的表现，通过点或边界框提示，对SAM的开箱即用的零样本能力进行初步评估，展示SAM在CT数据上的泛化能力良好，成为促进临床医生半自动分割工具进步的潜在催化剂。虽然SAM在我们的研究中未达到最先进的分割性能，但我们相信这种基础模型可以作为医学领域此类模型进一步适应复杂性的强大起点。",
