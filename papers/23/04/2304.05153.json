Therefore, we developed and evaluated a new self-supervised attention-based weakly supervised regression method that predicts continuous biomarkers directly from images in 11,671 patients across nine cancer types. We tested our method for multiple clinically and biologically relevant biomarkers: homologous repair deficiency (HRD) score, a clinically used pan-cancer biomarker, as well as markers of key biological processes in the tumor microenvironment. Using regression significantly enhances the accuracy of biomarker prediction, while also improving the interpretability of the results over classification.
