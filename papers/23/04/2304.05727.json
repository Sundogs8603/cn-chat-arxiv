    "translated_abstract": "可解释的AI已成为验证机器学习模型的流行工具。解释模型的决策策略与用户的领域知识之间的不匹配（例如Clever Hans效应）也被认为是改进错误模型的起点。然而，当用户和解释达成一致时，要怎么做就不那么清楚了。本文通过展示用户接受解释并不保证ML模型的良好功能，特别是一些隐藏的Clever Hans效应可能仍然未被发现，证明了这一点。我们通过贡献一个新方法Explanation-Guided Exposure Minimization (EGEM)，该方法预防性地修剪了ML模型中未受到积极解释反馈的变化。自然画像数据的实验表明，我们的方法导致模型大大减少了对隐藏的Clever Hans策略的依赖，并因此实现了更高的性能。",
