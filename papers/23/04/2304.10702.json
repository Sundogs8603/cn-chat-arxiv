    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a rich literature of data-driven approaches designed for power grid applications. However, insufficient consideration of domain knowledge can impose a high risk to the practicality of the methods. Specifically, ignoring the grid-specific spatiotemporal patterns (in load, generation, and topology, etc.) can lead to outputting infeasible, unrealizable, or completely meaningless predictions on new inputs. To address this concern, this paper investigates real-world operational data to provide insights into power grid behavioral patterns, including the time-varying topology, load, and generation, as well as the spatial differences (in peak hours, diverse styles) between individual loads and generations. Then based on these observations, we evaluate the generalization risks in some existing ML works causedby ignoring these grid-specific patterns in model design and training.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，出现了大量针对电力系统应用的数据驱动方法的文献。然而，忽略领域知识会对这些方法的实用性造成高风险。具体来说，忽略电网特定的时空模式（负荷、发电和拓扑等）可能导致对新输入输出不可行、不可实现或完全无意义的预测。为了解决这个问题，本文调查实际运行数据，提供电力系统行为模式的见解，包括时变的拓扑、负荷和发电以及单个负荷和发电之间的空间差异（在峰值时间、多种风格下）。然后根据这些观察结果，评估了一些现有机器学习方法在模型设计和训练中忽略这些电网特定模式所造成的泛化风险。",
