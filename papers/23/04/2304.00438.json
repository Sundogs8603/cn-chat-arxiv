    "abstract": "We propose a generalization of Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) built on a simple premise: some actions are more focal than others. In our model, which we call the Focal Quantal Response Equilibrium (Focal QRE), each player plays a stochastic version of Nash equilibrium as in the QRE, but some strategies are focal and thus are chosen relatively more frequently than other strategies after accounting for expected utilities. The Focal QRE is able to systemically account for various forms of bounded rationality of players, especially regret-aversion, salience, or limited consideration. The Focal QRE is also useful to explain observed heterogeneity of bounded rationality of players across different games. We show that regret-based focal sets perform relatively well at predicting strategies that are chosen more frequently relative to their expected utilities.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了量化响应均衡（QRE）的一种广义形式，该模型建立在一个简单的前提上：有些行为比其他行为更具焦点性。在我们的模型中，我们称之为焦点量化响应均衡（Focal QRE），每个玩家都以QRE中的随机纳什均衡策略进行游戏，但是一些策略是焦点策略，因此在考虑期望效用后，相对较频繁地被选择。 Focal QRE能够系统地考虑玩家的各种有限理性形式，尤其是后悔-规避，显著性或有限考虑。 Focal QRE还有助于解释在不同游戏中玩家的有限理性观察到的异质性。 我们展示了基于后悔的焦点集相对于其预期效用更能准确地预测策略何时被更频繁地选择。",
