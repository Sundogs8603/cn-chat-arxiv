    "abstract": "After the pandemic, artificial intelligence (AI) powered support for mental health care has become increasingly important. The breadth and complexity of significant challenges required to provide adequate care involve: (a) Personalized patient understanding, (b) Safety-constrained and medically validated chatbot patient interactions, and (c) Support for continued feedback-based refinements in design using chatbot-patient interactions. We propose Alleviate, a chatbot designed to assist patients suffering from mental health challenges with personalized care and assist clinicians with understanding their patients better. Alleviate draws from an array of publicly available clinically valid mental-health texts and databases, allowing Alleviate to make medically sound and informed decisions. In addition, Alleviate's modular design and explainable decision-making lends itself to robust and continued feedback-based refinements to its design. In this paper, we explain the different modules of A",

    "translated_abstract": "在疫情之后，基于人工智能的精神卫生护理支持变得愈发重要。为了提供足够的关怀，应对所面临挑战的广度和复杂性涉及：（a）个性化病人理解，（b）安全约束和医学验证的聊天机器人病人交互，以及（c）支持使用聊天机器人-病人交互进行基于反馈的设计的不断改进。我们提出了Alleviate，一个聊天机器人，旨在通过个性化护理来协助患有心理健康问题的患者，并协助临床医生更好地了解他们的患者。Alleviate利用一系列公开可用的临床有效的心理健康文本和数据库，从而使Alleviate能够做出医学上合理和知情的决策。此外，Alleviate的模块化设计和可解释性决策使其适合进行健壮和持续基于反馈的设计改进。在本文中，我们解释了Alleviate的不同模块以及它们如何共同为心理健康患者提供个性化的帮助。我们还通过一系列案例研究展示了Alleviate提供的基于人工智能的虚拟助手。",
