    "translated_abstract": "最近，在多智能体强化学习（MARL）领域的研究已经在学习社交行为和合作方面取得了成功。混合和博弈设置下智能体之间的社交困境已经得到了广泛的研究，但在完全合作的设置下，智能体之间的社交困境研究较少。虽然完全一致的利益有助于智能体之间的合作，并且可以带来奖励，但并不保证合作。我们提出了一种衡量智能体之间“固执”程度的指标，旨在体现其名称所描述的人类社交行为：一个慢慢升级和潜在灾难性的分歧。我们希望促进研究关于智能体固执的倾向，对应智能体的反应以及由此产生的社交动态。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为Stubborn的环境，用于评估具有完全一致激励的代理之间的固执程度。在我们的初步结果中，智能体学会了使用其行为来管理冲突，而不是选择以牺牲自己的最佳利益来达成一致。",
