    "translated_abstract": "旅行商问题(TSP)最初起源于交通和物流行业的经典路线优化问题，现已成为制造和生物等更广泛领域的重要任务。近年来，深度强化学习(DRL)因其高推理效率而越来越多地被采用来解决TSP问题。然而，大多数现有的端到端DRL算法仅在小规模TSP实例上表现良好，并且随着问题规模的扩大，内存消耗和计算时间急剧增加，很难推广到大规模问题上。本文提出了一种新颖的端到端DRL方法，称为Pointerformer，基于多指针Transformer。特别地，Pointerformer在编码器中采用了可逆残差网络，在解码器中采用了多指针网络，以有效控制编码器-解码器体系结构的内存消耗。为了进一步提高TSP解决方案的性能，Pointerformer还使用了深度Q网络(DQN)来指导解码器。实验结果表明，Pointerformer在大规模TSP实例上取得了最先进的效果。",
