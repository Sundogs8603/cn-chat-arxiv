    "abstract": "This paper targets the perceptual task of separating the different interacting voices, i.e., monophonic melodic streams, in a polyphonic musical piece. We target symbolic music, where notes are explicitly encoded, and model this task as a Multi-Trajectory Tracking (MTT) problem from discrete observations, i.e., notes in a pitch-time space. Our approach builds a graph from a musical piece, by creating one node for every note, and separates the melodic trajectories by predicting a link between two notes if they are consecutive in the same voice/stream. This kind of local, greedy prediction is made possible by node embeddings created by a heterogeneous graph neural network that can capture inter- and intra-trajectory information. Furthermore, we propose a new regularization loss that encourages the output to respect the MTT premise of at most one incoming and one outgoing link for every node, favouring monophonic (voice) trajectories; this loss function might also be useful in other gener",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在解决在多声部音乐中分离不同人声（即单声部旋律流）的感知问题。我们针对符号音乐，即明确编码音符，将此任务建模为从离散观测（即音高-时间空间中的音符）中的多轨迹跟踪问题。我们的方法通过为每个音符创建一个节点来构建音乐片段的图形，并通过预测两个音符之间的链接来分离旋律轨迹，如果它们在同一声部/流中连续。这种局部，贪心的预测是由异质图神经网络创建的节点嵌入所实现的，该节点嵌入可以捕捉轨迹之间和轨迹内的信息。此外，我们提出了一种新的正则化损失，鼓励输出遵守每个节点最多有一个入口和一个出口链接的多轨迹跟踪前提，支持单声部（人声）轨迹；这种损失函数在其他生成序列设置中也可能有用。",
