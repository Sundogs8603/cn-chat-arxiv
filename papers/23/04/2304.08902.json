    "abstract": "Since its conception, the cryptocurrency market has been frequently described as an immature market, characterized by significant swings in volatility and occasionally described as lacking rhyme or reason. There has been great speculation as to what role it plays in a diversified portfolio. For instance, is cryptocurrency exposure an inflationary hedge or a speculative investment that follows broad market sentiment with amplified beta? This paper aims to investigate whether the cryptocurrency market has recently exhibited similarly nuanced mathematical properties as the much more mature equity market. Our focus is on collective dynamics and portfolio diversification in the cryptocurrency market, and examining whether previously established results in the equity market hold in the cryptocurrency market, and to what extent.",

    "translated_abstract": "自发明以来，加密货币市场经常被描述为一个不成熟的市场，其波动率显著波动，并且偶尔被描述为缺乏规律。人们一直在猜测它在多样化投资组合中扮演着什么角色。例如，加密货币是否是通货膨胀对冲的工具，还是一种遵循市场情绪的投机性投资，其Beta值放大了呢？本文旨在调查加密货币市场是否展现出与更成熟的股票市场类似的复杂数学特性。我们关注加密货币市场的集体动力学和投资组合多样化，并研究在加密货币市场中先前建立的股票市场结果是否成立，以及程度如何。",
