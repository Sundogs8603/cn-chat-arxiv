    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a user-driven framework for regulating and auditing social media platforms to address the issue of content moderation. The framework regulates algorithmic filtering with respect to a flexible user-driven baseline and ensures that users are presented with content that does not deviate too much from this baseline, as guaranteed by a baseline feed."
