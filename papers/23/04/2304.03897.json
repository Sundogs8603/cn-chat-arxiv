Similar to FACTIFY 1.0, we have three broad categories - support, no-evidence, and refute, with sub-categories based on the entailment of visual and textual data. We also provide a BERT and Vison Tr",

    "translated_abstract": "互联网为全球提供了一个开放的平台，让人们表达自己的观点并分享自己的故事。虽然这非常有价值，但它也使得虚假新闻成为我们社会最紧迫的问题之一。手动的事实核对过程非常耗时，这使得我们很难在误导性言论造成重大伤害之前驳斥它们。这就是自动事实或声明验证受到关注的原因。一些现有数据集旨在支持自动化事实核查技术的发展，但大多数数据集都是基于文本的。多模态事实验证一直受到相对较少的关注。在本文中，我们提供了一个多模态事实核查数据集FACTIFY 2，通过使用新的数据来源和添加讽刺文章来改进Factify 1。Factify 2有50,000个新的数据实例。与FACTIFY 1.0类似，我们有三个广泛的类别——支持、无证据和驳斥，这些类别基于视觉和文本数据的蕴含关系具有子类别。我们还提供了一个基于BERT和Vision Transformer的FACTIFY 2事实核查模型，并表明其在Factify 1数据集上的表现优于现有最先进的方法。",
    "tldr": "本文提供了改进的多模态事实核查数据集Factify 2，其支持视觉和文本数据的蕴含关系。该数据集以支持、无证据和驳斥三个类别为主，包含50,000个新的数据实例，并提供一种基于BERT和Vision Transformer的最新事实核查模型，优于现有最先进的方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents an enhanced multi-modal fact-checking dataset called \"Factify 2\" that intends to improve the quality of automated fact-checking models. The dataset includes 50,000 new data instances and supports the entailment of visual and textual data in three categories: support, no-evidence, and refute. Additionally, the paper provides a new fact-checking model based on BERT and Vision Transformer, which achieves better performance than the current state-of-the-art methods."
