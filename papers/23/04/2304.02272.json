    "abstract": "We propose a generalization of the synthetic control method to a multiple-outcome framework, which improves the reliability of treatment effect estimation. This is done by supplementing the conventional pre-treatment time dimension with the extra dimension of related outcomes in computing the synthetic control weights. Our generalization can be particularly useful for studies evaluating the effect of a treatment on multiple outcome variables. To illustrate our method, we estimate the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on various outcomes in Sweden in the first 3 quarters of 2020. Our results suggest that if Sweden had implemented stricter NPIs like the other European countries by March, then there would have been about 70% fewer cumulative COVID-19 infection cases and deaths by July, and 20% fewer deaths from all causes in early May, whereas the impacts of the NPIs were relatively mild on the labor market and economic outcomes.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个将合成控制方法推广到多结果框架的算法，可以提高治疗效果评估的可靠性。这是通过在计算合成控制权重时，将传统的预处理时间维度与相关结果的额外维度进行补充来实现的。我们的推广对于评估一种治疗对于多个结果变量的影响的研究尤其有用。我们用瑞典在2020年前三个季度的数据来说明我们的方法，估计非药物干预措施对多个结果的影响。我们的结果表明，如果瑞典在3月份像欧洲其他国家一样实施了更严格的非药物干预措施，那么到7月份，COVID-19感染病例和死亡人数将减少约70％，而在5月初所有原因的死亡人数将减少约20％。而非药物干预措施对劳动力市场和经济结果的影响相对较小。",
