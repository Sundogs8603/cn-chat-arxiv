    "translated_abstract": "为了将机器学习应用于任何决策过程中，必须将给定的知识（例如自然语言，非结构化文本）转化为可以被其兼容语言和数据格式的机器学习模型理解和处理的表示向量。然而，经常遇到的困难是，首先给定的知识并不充分或可靠。在这种情况下，人们会寻求融合来自单独领域的辅助信息来缓解好的表示学习和感兴趣领域的稀缺知识之间的差距。这种方法被称为跨领域知识转移。研究这个问题是至关重要的，因为在许多情况下，从在线医疗平台分析到金融市场风险量化，都存在稀缺知识的共性，这为我们从自动化决策中受益留下了障碍。从机器学习的角度来看，半监督学习范式利用了这种跨领域转移的思想。",
