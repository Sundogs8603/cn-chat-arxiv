    "abstract": "Several studies have shown that just as there are some quite non-trivial statistical properties in the time series of financial asset returns, the volumes of transactions and of orders entered into the order book also display interesting and complex statistical properties. For instance, a recurring observation in the literature has been that the sizes of volumes, both of incoming orders and of realized transactions, can take on many different values across several orders of magnitude, with a marked preference for whole numbers like 5, 10, 100 and so on. Another common finding is that the time series of volumes present long lived autocorrelations, with decay rates that can be well approximated by power laws. These studies have focused their attention on the volume of incoming orders or on the volume of registered transactions, but there is another source of data relevant for a deeper understanding of market dynamics: the volume stored at the best ask and best bid.

    "translated_abstract": "几项研究表明，金融资产回报时间序列中存在一些相当非平凡的统计特性，交易和委托薄中的交易量与委托量也显示出有趣而复杂的统计特性。本文研究了比特币/美元市场中最佳买价和最佳卖价下的交易量的统计特性。使用Bitfinex交易所的数据，我们发现交易量时间序列中存在长程相关性和幂律衰减的证据。我们还观察到最佳买价和最佳卖价下的交易量之间存在强烈的同步性，这是其他金融市场不具备的特征。我们的发现有助于更深入地了解比特币市场的动态。",
