To this end, previous methods have algorithmically generated diverse scenarios that reveal system failures in a shared control teleoperation task. However, these methods require directly evaluating generated scenarios by simulating robot policies and human actions. The computational cost of these evaluations limits their applicability in more complex domains. Thus, we propose augmenting scenario generation systems with surrogate models that predict both human and robot behaviors. In the shared control teleoperation domain and a more complex shared workspace collaboration task, we show that surrogate assisted scenario generation efficiently synthesizes diverse datasets of challenging scenarios. We demonstrate that these failures are reproducible in real-world interactions.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着人机交互系统的发展，不同环境和用户下评估和理解这些系统的优缺点变得越来越困难。为此，以往的方法通过算法生成了多样的场景，揭示了共享控制遥操作任务的系统失效情况。然而，这些方法需要通过模拟机器人策略和人类行为来直接评估生成的场景。这些评估所需的计算成本限制了它们在更复杂的领域的适用性。因此，我们提出了通过替代模型来预测人类和机器人行为来增强场景生成系统的建议。在共享控制遥操作域和更复杂的共享工作空间协作任务中，我们展示了替代模型辅助的场景生成可以高效地合成具有挑战性的多样数据集。我们展示了这些故障在真实世界中的交互中是可重现的。",
