    "abstract": "We investigate the potential of ChatGPT as a multidimensional evaluator for the task of \\emph{Text Style Transfer}, alongside, and in comparison to, existing automatic metrics as well as human judgements. We focus on a zero-shot setting, i.e. prompting ChatGPT with specific task instructions, and test its performance on three commonly-used dimensions of text style transfer evaluation: style strength, content preservation, and fluency. We perform a comprehensive correlation analysis for two transfer directions (and overall) at different levels. Compared to existing automatic metrics, ChatGPT achieves competitive correlations with human judgments. These preliminary results are expected to provide a first glimpse into the role of large language models in the multidimensional evaluation of stylized text generation.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了使用ChatGPT作为一种多维评估器来评估文本风格转换的潜力，与现有的自动度量标准和人类判断相比。我们专注于零-shot设置，即使用特定的任务指令提示ChatGPT，在风格强度、内容保留和流畅度三个常用的文本风格转换评估维度上测试其性能。我们在不同级别上进行了全面的相关分析，比较了两个转换方向（以及总体）的结果。与现有的自动度量标准相比，ChatGPT在与人类判断的相关性上具有竞争力。这些初步结果有望首次揭示大语言模型在彩色文本生成的多维评估中的作用。",
