    "translated_abstract": "机器人进行精细操纵任务，如穿缆带或插入电池之类的任务，一直是难题，因为它们需要精确的协调、紧闭回路视觉反馈。通常需要高端机器人、准确的传感器或精心的校准，这可能是昂贵且难以安装。机器学习是否能够使低成本和不精确的硬件也能执行这些精细操纵任务？我们提出了一种低成本系统，直接从使用自定义远程操作界面收集的真实演示中进行端到端的模仿学习。然而，模仿学习本身也存在着挑战，特别是在高精度领域：策略中的错误可能会随着时间的推移而不断累积，并且人类演示可能是非静态的。为了解决这些挑战，我们开发了一种简单而新颖的算法，Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT)，它学习了一个带有动作序列的生成模型。ACT允许机器人学习复杂的双手操作。",
