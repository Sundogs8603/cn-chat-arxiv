    "abstract": "This article investigates mechanism-based explanations for a well-known empirical pattern in sociology of education, namely, that Black-White unequal access to school resources -- defined as advanced coursework -- is the highest in racially diverse and majority-White schools. Through an empirically calibrated and validated agent-based model, this study explores the dynamics of two qualitatively informed mechanisms, showing (1) that we have reason to believe that the presence of White students in school can influence the emergence of Black-White advanced enrollment disparities and (2) that such influence can represent another possible explanation for the macro-level pattern of interest. Results contribute to current scholarly accounts of within-school inequalities, shedding light into policy strategies to improve the educational experiences of Black students in racially integrated settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了教育社会学中一个众所周知的实证模式的机制解释，即黑白人在进阶课程等学校资源获取上的不平等在种族多样和以白人为主的学校中最为明显。通过一个经验性的校准和验证代理模型，本研究探讨了两种定性决策机制的动态，显示(1)我们有理由相信白人学生的存在对黑白人的进阶课程招生差异的出现有影响；(2)这种影响可能代表了有关宏观模式的另一个可能的解释。结果有助于目前有关内校不平等的学术研究，为政策战略提供指导，以提高黑人学生在种族交融的环境中的教育体验。",

It found that the presence of White students can affect the emergence of advanced enrollment disparities between Black and White students, and may be another explanation for this macro-level pattern."
