    "translated_abstract": "在金融、银行和医疗等领域，保护数据隐私至关重要。联邦学习（FL）由于其分散、分布式的训练和同时获得全局共享模型的保护隐私的能力而受到广泛关注。然而，FL面临着通信开销和有限的资源能力等挑战。因此，我们提出了一个两阶段联邦学习方法，以实现隐私保护的目标，并进行了以下首次研究：（i）在第一阶段，通过使用两种不同的分布作为噪声来生成合成数据集，并将其应用于改进的条件表生成对抗神经网络（CTGAN），（ii）在第二阶段，开发和采用联邦概率神经网络（FedPNN）来构建全局共享分类模型。我们还采用了合成数据集指标来检查生成的合成数据集的质量。",
