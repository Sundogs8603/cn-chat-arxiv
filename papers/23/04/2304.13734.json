    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in various tasks, their (arguably) most prominent drawback is generating inaccurate or false information with a confident tone. In this paper, we hypothesize that the LLM's internal state can be used to reveal the truthfulness of a statement. Therefore, we introduce a simple yet effective method to detect the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements, which utilizes the LLM's hidden layer activations to determine the veracity of statements. To train and evaluate our method, we compose a dataset of true and false statements in six different topics. A classifier is trained to detect which statement is true or false based on an LLM's activation values. Specifically, the classifier receives as input the activation values from the LLM for each of the statements in the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that our method for detecting statement veracity significantly outperforms even few-shot prompting methods, highlighting",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然大型语言模型（LLM）在各种任务中表现出了卓越的性能，但它们（可能）最为突出的缺点是以自信的语气生成不准确或虚假的信息。本文假设LLM的内部状态可以用于揭示一个语句的真实性。因此，我们介绍了一种简单但有效的方法来检测LLM所生成语句的真实性，该方法利用LLM的隐藏层激活来确定语句的真实性。为了训练和评估我们的方法，我们构建了一个包含六个不同主题的数据集，其中包含真实和虚假的语句。一个分类器被训练出来，根据LLM的激活值来检测哪个语句是真实的或虚假的。具体而言，分类器接收LLM为数据集中每个语句生成的激活值作为输入。我们的实验表明，我们检测语句真实性的方法甚至比少量提示方法表现更好，凸显了利用LLM的内部状态来提高其可信度的潜力。",
