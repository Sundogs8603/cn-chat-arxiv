    "abstract": "Based on the 10.9K articles from top 40 news providers of South Korea, this paper analyzed the media framing of Itaewon Halloween Crowd Crush during the first 72 hours after the incident. By adopting word-vector embedding and clustering, we figured out that conservative media focused on political parties' responses and the suspect's identity while the liberal media covered the responsibility of the government and possible unequal spillover effect on the low-income industry workers. Although the social tragedy was not directly connected to institutional politics, the media clearly exhibited political bias in the coverage process.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文基于韩国前40家新闻提供商的10.9K篇文章，分析了事件发生后前72小时内媒体对梨泰院万圣节踩踏事件的报道。通过采用词向量嵌入和聚类，发现保守派媒体注重政党的反应和嫌疑人的身份，而自由派媒体则关注政府的责任和对低收入产业工人可能产生的不公平溢出效应。尽管该社会悲剧与制度政治没有直接联系，但媒体在报道过程中明显展现了政治偏见。",

The results show that conservative media focused on political parties' responses and the suspect's identity while liberal media covered the responsibility of the government and potential negative impact on low-income workers. Political bias was exhibited in the media coverage process even though the tragedy was not directly related to institutional politics."
