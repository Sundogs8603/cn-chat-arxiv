We propose a \"distributed venture firm\" powered by software automations and governed by a set of functional teams called \"Pods\" that carry out specific tasks with immediate and long-term payouts given on a deal-by-deal basis. Avenues are provided for further research to validate this model and discover likely paths to implementation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文结合激励模型和实证元分析，对驱动风险投资公司优化其实践以增加GP效用的激励系统提出了尖锐的批评，这些实践与改善初创企业股权的基础资产不相关。我们提出了一种由软件自动化推动的“分布式创业投资公司”，由一组名为“Pods”的功能小组管理，他们在交易-交易的基础上执行特定任务，并获得即时和长期回报。提供了进一步研究的途径，以验证这个模型并发现实施的可能路径。",
