    "translated_abstract": "本文关注于联盟博弈的稳定性，即可转移效用的合作博弈。首先，核心概念可以被弱化，以便仅限于具有多边背书的变化。这一共识性阻止原则以及传统的单方面阻止和其间的跨越阻止原则都可以应用于分区分配对。每个这样的对由大联盟的一个分区和相应的分配向量组成，其组成部分对于给定分区的各个组合联盟来说都是合理的和有效的。对于所得到的强稳定概念、中等稳定概念和弱稳定概念，第一个与传统核心相容，因为传统核心确切地包含了那些通过该强稳定概念与仅包括大联盟的所有合并分区相关联的分配。可能更重要的是，在这种情况下，后一种中等和弱稳定概念的行为就如人们所预期的一样：前者强于后者。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了分区分配对下的联盟博弈，提出了强、中等和弱稳定概念，并证明了强稳定概念与传统核心相容，中等和弱稳定概念按照预期强度排序。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies coalition games under partition-allocation pairs, proposes strong, medium, and weak stability concepts, and proves that the strong stability concept is compatible with the traditional core, while the medium and weak stability concepts are ranked in the expected order of strength."
