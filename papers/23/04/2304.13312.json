    "abstract": "In this technical note, we aim to explain a deep neural network (DNN) by quantifying the encoded interactions between input variables, which reflects the DNN's inference logic. Specifically, we first rethink the definition of interactions, and then formally define faithfulness and conciseness for interaction-based explanation. To this end, we propose two kinds of interactions, i.e., the AND interaction and the OR interaction. For faithfulness, we prove the uniqueness of the AND (OR) interaction in quantifying the effect of the AND (OR) relationship between input variables. Besides, based on AND-OR interactions, we design techniques to boost the conciseness of the explanation, while not hurting the faithfulness. In this way, the inference logic of a DNN can be faithfully and concisely explained by a set of symbolic concepts.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在通过量化输入变量之间的编码交互来解释深度神经网络(DNN)的推理逻辑。具体而言，我们首先重新思考交互的定义，然后正式定义了基于交互的解释的准确性和简洁性。为此，我们提出了两种交互方式，即AND交互和OR交互。针对准确性，我们证明了AND（OR）交互在量化输入变量之间的AND（OR）关系效应方面的唯一性。此外，基于AND-OR交互，我们设计了技术来提高解释的简洁性，同时不会损害准确性。因此，DNN的推理逻辑可以通过一组符号概念准确而简明地解释。",
