    "abstract": "We examine the potential of ChatGPT, and other large language models, in predicting stock market returns using sentiment analysis of news headlines. We use ChatGPT to indicate whether a given headline is good, bad, or irrelevant news for firms' stock prices. We then compute a numerical score and document a positive correlation between these ``ChatGPT scores'' and subsequent daily stock market returns. Further, ChatGPT outperforms traditional sentiment analysis methods. We find that more basic models such as GPT-1, GPT-2, and BERT cannot accurately forecast returns, indicating return predictability is an emerging capacity of complex models. Our results suggest that incorporating advanced language models into the investment decision-making process can yield more accurate predictions and enhance the performance of quantitative trading strategies.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了使用情感分析预测股市回报的潜力，探讨了使用ChatGPT以及其他大语言模型在预测股市回报方面的表现。我们使用ChatGPT判断新闻标题对公司股票价格是好消息、坏消息或无关消息。通过计算数字分数，我们发现这些\"ChatGPT分数\"和随后的日常股票市场回报之间存在正相关性。而且，ChatGPT的表现优于传统的情感分析方法。同时，我们发现GPT-1、GPT-2和BERT等基础模型无法准确预测回报，这表明回报可预测性是复杂模型的一种新兴能力。我们的研究结果表明，将先进的语言模型纳入投资决策过程可以产生更准确的预测，并提高定量交易策略的表现。",
