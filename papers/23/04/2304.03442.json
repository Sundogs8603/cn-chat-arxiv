To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior.

    "translated_abstract": "可信的人类行为仿真可赋能于从沉浸式环境到人际交流排练空间到原型工具的交互式应用程序。在本文中，我们介绍了生成代理——具有可信度的人类行为仿真的计算机软件代理。生成代理会起床，做早餐，去工作；艺术家画画，作家写作；他们形成观点，互相注意，并开始交谈；他们回忆过去的日子并计划未来。为了使生成代理能够实现，我们描述了一种架构，它将大型语言模型扩展到使用自然语言存储代理的经历的完整记录，随着时间的推移综合这些记忆到更高层次的反思，以及动态检索这些记忆以规划行为。我们实例化生成代理以填充受《模拟人生》启发的交互式沙盒环境，最终用户可以使用自然语言对话系统与25个代理交互。",
