    "translated_abstract": "近年来，Wasserstein Barycenter Problem (WBP) 在人工智能领域受到了广泛关注。本文专注于 WBP 的分散式设置，并提出了一种异步分散式算法 (A$^2$DWB)。A$^2$DWB 基于一种新颖的随机块协调下降方法来优化熵正则化 WBP 的对偶问题。据我们所知，A$^2$DWB 是 WBP 的第一个异步分散式算法。与其同步版本不同的是，A$^2$DWB 以一种仅依赖于过时的邻居信息的方式更新本地变量，从而有效地减轻了等待开销，从而实质性地提高了时间效率。实验证明，与最新的同步算法相比，A$^2$DWB 的性能优异。",
