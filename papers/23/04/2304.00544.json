    "abstract": "This paper studies the extent to which the cyclicality of occupational mobility shapes that of aggregate unemployment and its duration distribution. We document the relation between workers' occupational mobility and unemployment duration over the long run and business cycle. To interpret this evidence, we develop a multi-sector business cycle model with heterogenous agents. The model is quantitatively consistent with several important features of the US labor market: procyclical gross and countercyclical net occupational mobility, the large volatility of unemployment and the cyclical properties of the unemployment duration distribution, among many others. Our analysis shows that occupational mobility due to workers; changing career prospects, and not occupation-wide differences, interacts with aggregate conditions to drive the fluctuations of the unemployment duration distribution and the aggregate unemployment rate.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了职业流动性周期性程度对总失业率及其持续时间分布的影响。我们记录了工人职业流动性与失业持续时间在长期和商业周期上的关系。为了解释这一证据，我们开发了一个具有异质性代理商的多部门商业周期模型。该模型与美国劳动力市场的几个重要特征在数量上保持一致：毛周期性的净职业流动和反周期性的净职业流动，失业率的大波动以及失业持续时间分布的周期特性等。我们的分析显示，由于工人职业前景的变化，而不是整个职业的差异，与总体经济环境互动，推动了失业持续时间分布和总失业率的波动。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the impact of the cyclicality of occupational mobility on the aggregate unemployment rate and its duration distribution, and develops a multi-sector business cycle model to conclude that fluctuations in the unemployment duration distribution and aggregate unemployment rate are driven by changes in workers' career prospects, rather than occupational differences."
