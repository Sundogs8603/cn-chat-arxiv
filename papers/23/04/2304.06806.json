    "translated_abstract": "自细胞薄片到鸟群等许多集体系统都存在于远离平衡状态的自然环境中。这些系统反映了一种活性物质形式，其中单个物质组件具有内部能量。在特定的参数范围内，这些活性系统会经历相变，表现为单个组件的小波动可以导致系统流变性质的全局变化。通常使用统计物理学的模拟和方法来理解和预测这些相变的真实观测。在这项工作中，我们证明了基于模拟的推断可用于从系统观察中强健地推断出活性物质参数。此外，我们证明，可以使用少量（从一个到三个）系统快照来进行参数推断，并且这种基于图形信息的方法优于系统的平均速度或平均平方位移等典型指标。我们的工作强调，可以使用有限数量的快照来准确预测高级系统行为，并且基于图形信息的方法可以提高活性物质模型的参数推断精度。",
