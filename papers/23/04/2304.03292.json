    "translated_abstract": "形状子序列是使用本地特征（子序列）鉴别时间序列的有前途的时间序列聚类方法。现有的时间序列聚类方法可能无法捕获代表性形状子序列，因为它们从大量无信息的子序列中发现形状子序列，因此聚类准确性较低。本文提出了一种使用少量标记的和传播的伪标记时间序列来帮助发现代表性形状子序列，从而提高聚类准确性的半监督时间序列聚类方法（SS-Shapelets）。在SS-Shapelets中，我们提出了两种技术来发现代表性形状子序列，以便有效地聚类时间序列。1）一个“显著子序列链”（$SSC$），可以从标记/伪标记的时间序列中提取显著子序列（作为候选形状子序列），从而有助于从池中删除大量无信息的子序列。2）一种“线性判别选择形状子序列”（$LDSS$），它选择在多个时间序列之间具有区别性的形状子序列。",
