    "translated_abstract": "在联邦学习领域的众多研究中，个性化是解决客户端异质性的一个至关重要和具有挑战性的问题，但已有的作品主要关注的是调整模型。然而，由于客户端的异质性，他们每个人可能需要不同的超参数选择，这方面尚未进行研究。我们指出了个性化联邦超参数优化 (pFedHPO) 的两个挑战：如何处理指数级增长的搜索空间，如何表征每个客户端而不损害其数据隐私。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出了一种学习超参数网络 (HPN) 的方案，该网络使用客户端编码来决定个性化的超参数选择。客户端编码使用基于随机投影的过程进行计算，以保护每个客户端的隐私。此外，我们设计了一种新的机制来去除低保真度函数评估样本的偏差，以便学习 HPN。",
