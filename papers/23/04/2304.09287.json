    "translated_abstract": "基于嵌入式检索已经被广泛应用于电子商务、社交网络搜索等各种搜索应用中。尽管该方法在语义匹配和上下文搜索等任务中表现出了良好的效果，但它仍受到无法控制的关联性问题的困扰。本文在对早期应用于我们的社交网络搜索引擎的嵌入式检索进行分析的基础上，定义了引入的两种主要的故障类型，完整性和垃圾性。前者是指可以严重危害用户体验的仇恨言论和攻击性内容等问题，而后者包括类似模糊文本匹配或语言不匹配的无关结果。进一步提出了有效的模型推断方法来解决这个问题，包括索引处理和针对性用户分组处理等。尽管方法简单，但我们证明了这些方法在离线NDCG和在线A/B测试指标增益方面具有良好的表现。我们分析了这些故障的原因并提出了有效的解决方案来解决在基于嵌入式检索的社交网络搜索中的完整性和垃圾性问题。",
