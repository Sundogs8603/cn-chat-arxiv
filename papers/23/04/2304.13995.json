    "abstract": "In many computer vision applications, images are acquired with arbitrary or random rotations and translations, and in such setups, it is desirable to obtain semantic representations disentangled from the image orientation. Examples of such applications include semiconductor wafer defect inspection, plankton microscope images, and inference on single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) micro-graphs. In this work, we propose Invariant Representation Learning with Implicit Neural Representation (IRL-INR), which uses an implicit neural representation (INR) with a hypernetwork to obtain semantic representations disentangled from the orientation of the image. We show that IRL-INR can effectively learn disentangled semantic representations on more complex images compared to those considered in prior works and show that these semantic representations synergize well with SCAN to produce state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering results.",

    "translated_abstract": "在许多计算机视觉应用中，图像是以任意或随机旋转和平移的方式获取的。在这样的设置中，获取与图像方向无关的语义表示是可取的。本文提出了一种使用隐式神经表示（INR）和超网络进行表示学习的方法，称为不变性表示学习（IRL-INR）。我们展示了IRL-INR可以在比以前的工作中更复杂的图像上有效地学习分离的语义表示，并且表明这些语义表示可以与SCAN很好地协同工作，从而产生最先进的无监督聚类结果。",
