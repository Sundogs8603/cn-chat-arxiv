    "abstract": "The prevalence of memes on social media has created the need to sentiment analyze their underlying meanings for censoring harmful content. Meme censoring systems by machine learning raise the need for a semi-supervised learning solution to take advantage of the large number of unlabeled memes available on the internet and make the annotation process less challenging. Moreover, the approach needs to utilize multimodal data as memes' meanings usually come from both images and texts. This research proposes a multimodal semi-supervised learning approach that outperforms other multimodal semi-supervised learning and supervised learning state-of-the-art models on two datasets, the Multimedia Automatic Misogyny Identification and Hateful Memes dataset.

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体上Memes的普及性引发了分析其隐含含义、审查有害内容的需求。机器学习的Meme审查系统需要半监督学习解决方案，以利用互联网上大量未标记的Memes，并使注释过程变得更简单。此外，该方法需要利用多模态数据，因为Memes的含义通常来自图像和文本。该研究提出了一种多模态半监督学习方法，在两个数据集，即多媒体自动性别歧视识别和令人讨厌的Memes数据集上，优于其他多模态半监督和监督学习的最新模型。借鉴对比语言-图像预训练所获得的见解，这项研究引入了SemiMemes，一种新颖的训练方法，它结合了自编码器和分类任务",
