    "abstract": "In recent years people have become increasingly reliant on social media to read news and get information, and some social media users post unsubstantiated information to gain attention. Such information is known as rumours. Nowadays, rumour detection is receiving a growing amount of attention because of the pandemic of the New Coronavirus, which has led to a large number of rumours being spread. In this paper, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system is built to predict rumours. The best model is applied to the COVID-19 tweets to conduct exploratory data analysis. The contribution of this study is twofold: (1) to compare rumours and facts using state-of-the-art natural language processing models in two dimensions: language structure and propagation route. (2) An analysis of how rumours differ from facts in terms of their lexical use and the emotions they imply. This study shows that linguistic structure is a better feature to distinguish rumours from facts compared to the propagation",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人们越来越依赖社交媒体获取新闻和信息，一些社交媒体用户发布缺乏证实的信息以获取关注，这种信息被称为谣言。本文构建了自然语言处理（NLP）系统来预测谣言。其中，最佳模型被应用于新冠疫情相关推文的探索性数据分析。本研究的贡献有两个方面：（1）通过两个维度：语言结构和传播路径，使用最先进的自然语言处理模型来比较谣言和事实。（2）通过分析谣言与事实在词汇使用和暗示的情感方面的不同，探究谣言与事实之间的不同。该研究表明，相比传播路径，语言结构是更好的特征来区分谣言和事实。",
