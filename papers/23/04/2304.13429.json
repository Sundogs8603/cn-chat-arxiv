Our proposed approach outperformed existing models with 99.86% accuracy. We also conducted NF1 and interpretable AI tests to validate our approach. Our work provides an explainable approach model using logistic regression and explanatory stimulus as well as a black-box model. The explainable models help to explain the predictions of black-box models while the glass-box models provide information about the best-fit features.
