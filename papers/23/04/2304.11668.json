    "translated_abstract": "特征表达的可分性对于开放式人脸识别至关重要。之前的方法依赖于代表身份的可学习分类层权重。然而，评估过程不学习身份表示，并在训练中删除分类器。这种不一致可能会困惑特征编码器，阻碍基于身份的方法的有效性。为了缓解以上问题，我们提出了一种新方法，即面向人脸识别的对比正则化（CoReFace），通过对特征表示学习应用基于图像的正则化。具体来说，我们采用样本导向的对比学习来直接约束图像间关系，这与评估过程一致。为了将对比学习融入人脸识别中，我们增强了嵌入而不是图像，避免了图像质量退化。然后，我们提出了一种新的针对变换不变人脸识别的对比损失，能够处理大的姿态和表情变化。在几个基准数据集上的实验证明了我们的方法在提高深度人脸识别性能方面的有效性。",
