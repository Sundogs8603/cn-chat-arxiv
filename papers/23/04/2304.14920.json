    "translated_abstract": "疲劳驾驶对行车安全有着至关重要的影响，促使人们迫切需要进行司机疲劳检测。脑电图（EEG）信号能够准确反映精神疲劳状态，因此在疲劳监测方面得到了广泛研究。然而，原始的EEG数据本质上是嘈杂且冗余的，这被现有的研究忽视了，这些研究仅使用单通道EEG数据或全头通道EEG数据进行模型训练，导致司机疲劳检测性能有限。本文首次提出了一种解释性引导的通道选择框架（ICS）用于司机疲劳检测任务。具体而言，我们设计了一个两阶段的训练策略，通过解释性引导逐步选择关键的贡献通道。我们首先在第一阶段使用全头通道EEG数据训练一个教师网络，然后对训练好的教师模型应用类激活映射（CAM）来突出显示对于疲劳检测任务有高贡献的通道。基于选择的关键通道，我们在第二阶段训练一个更轻量级的学生网络，它使用的通道数量少得多，同时实现了与最先进方法相当的性能。在两个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的ICS框架在提高司机疲劳检测的准确性、可解释性和效率方面具有显著的效果。",
