    "translated_abstract": "农业灌溉是淡水消耗的重要贡献者。然而，目前田间使用的灌溉系统效率不高。它们主要依赖于土壤湿度传感器和种植者的经验，但并不考虑未来的土壤水分损失。预测土壤水分损失很具有挑战性，因为它受到许多因素的影响，包括土壤质地、天气条件和植物特性。本文提出了一种名为DRLIC的解决方案来提高灌溉效率。DRLIC是一种复杂的灌溉系统，它使用深度强化学习(DRL)来优化其性能。该系统采用一种神经网络，称为DRL控制代理，可以学习考虑当前土壤水分测量和未来土壤水分损失的最佳控制策略。我们引入了一个灌溉奖励函数，使控制代理能够从以往的经验中学习。然而，由于硬件限制，DRLIC的操作在某些情况下可能不实用。因此，本文提出了DRLIC的简化版本，它使用更小的神经网络和更少的输入。结果表明，DRLIC和简化版本在水分利用效率和作物产量方面均优于当前的灌溉方法。",
