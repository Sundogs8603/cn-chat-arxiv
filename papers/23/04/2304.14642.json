    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文证明了高分辨率微分方程框架非常适合Nesterov的加速梯度下降法（\\texttt{NAG}）以及它的近端对应物——更快的迭代阈值收缩算法（FISTA）。但是，该理论体系仍然不完整，因为欠阻尼情况（$r<2$）尚未包括在内。本文基于高分辨率微分方程框架，构建了欠阻尼情况下的新的Lyapunov函数，激发于时间$t^{\\gamma}$或迭代$k^{\\gamma}$的混合项的影响。当动量参数$r$为$2$时，新的Lyapunov函数与之前的函数相同。这些新的证明不仅包括了以前根据低分辨率微分方程框架得出的目标值的收敛速率，还表征了最小梯度范数平方的收敛速率。",
