    "abstract": "Forecasting financial time series (FTS) is an essential field in finance and economics that anticipates market movements in financial markets. This paper investigates the accuracy of text mining and technical analyses in forecasting financial time series. It focuses on the S&P500 stock market index during the pandemic, which tracks the performance of the largest publicly traded companies in the US. The study compares two methods of forecasting the future price of the S&P500: text mining, which uses NLP techniques to extract meaningful insights from financial news, and technical analysis, which uses historical price and volume data to make predictions. The study examines the advantages and limitations of both methods and analyze their performance in predicting the S&P500. The FinBERT model outperforms other models in terms of S&P500 price prediction, as evidenced by its lower RMSE value, and has the potential to revolutionize financial analysis and prediction using financial news data.

    "translated_abstract": "预测金融时间序列是金融和经济领域的重要研究方向，旨在预测金融市场的走势。本文研究了文本挖掘和技术分析在预测金融时间序列中的准确性，并聚焦于S&P500股票市场指数，该指数追踪美国最大的上市公司的表现。本研究比较了两种预测S&P500未来价格的方法：文本挖掘和技术分析。文本挖掘利用自然语言处理技术从财经新闻中提取有意义的信息，技术分析则使用历史价格和成交量数据进行预测。研究考察了两种方法的优缺点，并分析了它们在预测S&P500中的性能。FinBERT模型在S&P500价格预测方面表现较好，其根均方误差较低，有潜力利用财经新闻数据进一步革新金融分析和预测。",
