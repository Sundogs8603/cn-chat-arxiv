    "translated_abstract": "基于扩散模型的生成式多模态模型近年来取得了巨大的发展和进步。像DALL-E和Stable Diffusion这样的模型越来越受欢迎，成功地从文本中创建图像，经常结合抽象的想法。然而，像其他深度学习模型一样，它们也反映了从互联网中爬取的训练数据中继承的社会偏见。手动审核模型中的偏见可能非常耗时和资源消耗，并且由这些模型可以接受的输入的无限制和不受约束的性质使问题更加复杂。 对于偏见的度量与量化的研究通常侧重于单模态的小型单阶段模型。因此，多阶段多模态模型的出现需要不同的方法。 在本文中，我们提出了多模态复合关联评分（MCAS）作为衡量多模态生成式模型中性别偏差的新方法。通过使用MCAS评估DALL-E 2和稳定扩散，我们展示了检测并度量生成图像中性别偏差的能力。我们的结果表明，DALL-E 2生成的图像具有最小的性别偏见，而稳定扩散生成的图像存在显著的性别偏见。所提出的MCAS指标允许对大型复杂的多模态生成模型中的性别偏见进行高效且有效的识别和测量。",
