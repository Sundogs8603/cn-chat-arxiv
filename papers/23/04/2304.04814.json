    "abstract": "The most deadly and life-threatening disease in the world is lung cancer. Though early diagnosis and accurate treatment are necessary for lowering the lung cancer mortality rate. A computerized tomography (CT) scan-based image is one of the most effective imaging techniques for lung cancer detection using deep learning models. In this article, we proposed a deep learning model-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework for the early detection of lung cancer using CT scan images. We also have analyzed other models for instance Inception V3, Xception, and ResNet-50 models to compare with our proposed model. We compared our models with each other considering the metrics of accuracy, Area Under Curve (AUC), recall, and loss. After evaluating the model's performance, we observed that CNN outperformed other models and has been shown to be promising compared to traditional methods. It achieved an accuracy of 92%, AUC of 98.21%, recall of 91.72%, and loss of 0.328.",

    "translated_abstract": "肺癌是世界上最致命和危机的疾病之一，早期诊断和精确治疗是降低肺癌死亡率的必要条件。基于计算机断层扫描(CT)的图像是利用深度学习模型进行肺癌检测的最有效方法之一。本文提出了一种基于深度学习模型的卷积神经网络(CNN)框架，用于使用CT扫描图像早期检测肺癌。我们还分析了其他模型，例如Inception V3、Xception和ResNet-50模型，以与我们的模型进行比较。我们根据准确率、曲线下面积(AUC)、召回率和损失等指标对模型进行了比较。在评估模型性能后，我们发现CNN的性能优于其他模型，相比传统方法表现出了极大的潜力。它的准确率达到了92%、AUC为98.21%、召回率为91.72%、损失为0.328。",
