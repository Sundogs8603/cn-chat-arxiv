    "translated_abstract": "预训练嵌入在现代电子商务机器学习系统中的应用已经变得普遍。然而，在实践中，当在真实的生产系统中应用预训练嵌入时，我们遇到了几个关键问题，其中许多问题无法完全用当前的知识解释。不幸的是，我们发现缺乏对预训练嵌入的工作方式有全面的了解，特别是它们的内在属性和与下游任务的相互作用。因此，难以在实践中做出交互和可扩展的决策，以关于预训练嵌入的使用。我们的研究有两个重要的发现，关于在电子商务应用中使用预训练嵌入。首先，我们发现预训练和下游模型的设计，特别是它们如何通过嵌入向量编码和解码信息，可以产生深远的影响。其次，我们通过解决嵌入性质问题建立了预训练嵌入的原理视角。",
