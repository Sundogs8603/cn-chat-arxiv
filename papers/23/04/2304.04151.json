    "translated_abstract": "位置推荐在提高用户旅行体验方面扮演着至关重要的角色。被预测的POI的时间戳非常重要，因为用户会在不同时间去不同的地方。然而，大多数现有方法要么不使用这种时间信息，要么只是隐含地与其他上下文信息融合。本文重新审视了位置推荐问题，并指出显式地建模时间信息在模型需要预测不仅下一个位置，还需要预测进一步位置时大有裨益。此外，现有最先进的方法没有有效利用地理信息，并且在通过网格化编码地理信息时遇到了困难边界问题。因此，提出了一种基于时间提示的地理感知（TPG）框架。首先设计了时间提示以融合任何进一步的签到的时间信息。然后，设计了一个移动窗口机制对地理信息进行编码。",
