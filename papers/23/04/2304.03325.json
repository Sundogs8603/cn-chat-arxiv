    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型因其在各种任务上的出色表现而引起了人们的极大兴趣。其中，OpenAI开发的ChatGPT已经成为早期采用者中非常流行的模型，他们甚至将其视为客户服务、教育、医疗和金融等许多领域的破坏性技术。理解这些初期用户的观点非常重要，因为它可以为不同领域技术的潜在优势、劣势、成功或失败提供有价值的洞见。本研究考察了ChatGPT从不同对话QA语料库中生成的响应。研究使用BERT相似度分数将这些响应与正确答案进行比较，并获得自然语言推理（NLI）标签。还计算并比较了评估分数，以确定GPT-3＆GPT-4的整体性能。此外，该研究还确定了ChatGPT提供错误答案的情况，为相关领域提供了洞见。",
