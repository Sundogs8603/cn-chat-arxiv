    "translated_abstract": "属性图上的异常检测是一个实际应用中很重要的课题。现有方法因主要关注异常判别而忽略表示学习，存在语义混合和不平衡问题。这与异质性假设相冲突，即异常节点通常直接与正常节点相连。此外，异常节点比正常节点少得多，表明数据分布呈长尾形态。为了应对这些挑战，本文提出了一种独特的算法DSLAD，它是一种自我监督的方法，通过将异常判别和表示学习进行解耦来进行异常检测。DSLAD采用双线性池和掩码自编码器作为异常判别器。通过解耦异常判别和表示学习，构建了一个平衡的特征空间，其中节点更具语义鉴别能力，同时解决了不平衡问题。在各种数据集上的广泛实验表明DSLAD的有效性。",
