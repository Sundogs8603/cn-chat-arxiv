In this work, an explanation is provided for the mechanism of lifting for the Koopman operator of nonlinear systems with multiple attractors.

    "translated_abstract": "Koopman算子通过关注不变子空间中的观测量的演化，提供了非线性动力学的线性视角。感兴趣的观测量通常是从Koopman特征函数线性重构出来的。尽管Koopman算子在过去几年广泛使用，但对于具有多个稳定点的动力系统，关于Koopman算子的适用性存在一些误解。本研究解释了具有多个吸引子的非线性系统的Koopman算子提升机制。通过考虑Duffing振荡器的例子，我们表明通过利用吸引域之间的固有对称性，Koopman可观测空间中具有三个自由度的线性重构就足以全局线性化系统。",
