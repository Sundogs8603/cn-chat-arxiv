    "translated_abstract": "AI社区采用多感官或多模态方法来推进这一代AI模型的智能水平。将语言和图像相结合代表了特定任务的熟悉方法，例如从描述中生成图像标题或图像。本文将这些单片式方法与基于采用图像模型标记对象的轻量级和专业方法进行了比较，然后串行提交此结果对象列表给大型语言模型(LLM)。多个API的使用使得正确对象列表的平均精度达到95%以上，这些列表作为输入传递给最新的Open AI文本生成器(GPT-4)。为了演示API作为模块化替代方案，我们解决了一个用户拍下冰箱中有哪些食材的照片，然后生成适合于成本、准备时间、饮食限制、分量大小和多个因素的新颖菜谱卡的问题。",
