    "translated_abstract": "本文中，我们推导了一个分布式智能体网络在解决回归问题时，在通信约束、自适应和合作的情况下能够达到的性能。智能体使用了最近提出的 ACTC (adapt-compress-then-combine) 扩散策略，在这个策略中，邻近智能体交换的信号被随机不同压缩算子编码。我们详细阐述了均方估计误差的特征，其中包括了一项与没有通信约束的情况下智能体将要达到的误差有关的错误项，以及一项由于压缩而产生的误差项。分析揭示了分布式回归问题的基本属性，尤其是通过Perron特征向量引起的梯度噪声和网络拓扑结构（）。我们展示了知晓这些关系对于最优地分配智能体之间的通信资源是至关重要的。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper discusses the performance achievable by a network of distributed agents in solving a regression problem adaptively and in the presence of communication constraints. The paper characterizes the mean-square estimation error which includes both error from communication constraints and stochastic approximation error caused by gradient noise and network topology. It provides quantitative relationships between compression loss and fundamental attributes of the distributed regression problem, and shows the importance of knowledge of these relationships in optimal communication resource allocation among agents."
