    "abstract": "Automatic hate speech detection is an important yet complex task, requiring knowledge of common sense, stereotypes of protected groups, and histories of discrimination, each of which may constantly evolve. In this paper, we propose a group-specific approach to NLP for online hate speech detection. The approach consists of creating and infusing historical and linguistic knowledge about a particular protected group into hate speech detection models, analyzing historical data about discrimination against a protected group to better predict spikes in hate speech against that group, and critically evaluating hate speech detection models through lenses of intersectionality and ethics. We demonstrate this approach through a case study on NLP for detection of antisemitic hate speech. The case study synthesizes the current English-language literature on NLP for antisemitism detection, introduces a novel knowledge graph of antisemitic history and language from the 20th century to the present, in",

    "translated_abstract": "自动检测仇恨言论是一项重要但复杂的任务，需要了解常识、受保护群体的刻板印象和歧视历史，这些内容可能会不断演变。在本文中，我们提出了一种面向特定群体的自然语言处理方法，用于在线检测仇恨言论。该方法包括将有关特定保护群体的历史和语言知识纳入仇恨言论检测模型中，分析有关受保护群体歧视的历史数据，以更好地预测对该群体的仇恨言论激增，并通过交叉性和伦理标准对仇恨言论检测模型进行批判性评估。我们通过针对反犹主义仇恨言论检测的案例研究来演示这种方法。该案例研究综合了目前关于自然语言处理检测反犹主义言论的英语文献，并引入了一个涵盖 20 世纪至今反犹主义历史和语言的新型知识图谱。",
