    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习在医疗保健应用中有了重要作用，包括数字病理学中的图像搜索。尽管计算机视觉取得了重大进展，但在病理学档案的图像搜索方面仍存在重大问题。一个众所周知的问题是AI偏见和缺乏泛化能力。一个更特别的深度模型缺点是对搜索功能的无知。前者影响每个模型，后者只影响搜索和匹配。由于缺乏基于排名的学习，研究人员必须基于分类误差来训练模型，然后使用所得的嵌入进行图像搜索。此外，即使使用各种医院的大型图像库，深度模型似乎也容易产生内部偏见。本文提出了两个新颖的想法以提高图像搜索性能。首先，我们使用排名损失函数来指导特征提取朝向搜索的匹配导向性。通过强制模型学习排名，我们可以避免分类误差带来的问题。其次，我们提出一种称为交错学习的方法，在扩大训练数据集的同时减少模型内部偏差。",
