    "abstract": "Decision-focused (DF) model-based reinforcement learning has recently been introduced as a powerful algorithm which can focus on learning the MDP dynamics which are most relevant for obtaining high rewards. While this approach increases the performance of agents by focusing the learning towards optimizing for the reward directly, it does so by learning less accurate dynamics (from a MLE standpoint), and may thus be brittle to changes in the reward function. In this work, we develop the robust decision-focused (RDF) algorithm which leverages the non-identifiability of DF solutions to learn models which maximize expected returns while simultaneously learning models which are robust to changes in the reward function. We demonstrate on a variety of toy example and healthcare simulators that RDF significantly increases the robustness of DF to changes in the reward function, without decreasing the overall return the agent obtains.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，决策重点（Decision-focused，DF）的基于模型的强化学习被介绍为一种强有力的算法，它可以专注于学习最有利于获得高报酬的MDP动态。虽然这种方法通过专注于直接优化报酬来提高智能体的性能，但从MLE的角度来看，它学习的动力学不够准确，因此可能对奖励函数的变化很脆弱。在这项工作中，我们开发了稳健决策重点（RDF）算法，它利用DF解的非识别性，学习同时最大化期望回报和抵御奖励函数变化的模型。我们在各种玩具示例和医疗模拟器上展示了RDF显着增加了DF对奖励函数变化的稳健性，而不会降低智能体的总回报。",
