    "translated_abstract": "在许多实际的网络应用中，例如在线推荐、数据库检索和查询文档搜索，双分图图搜索是基础且多用途的。传统方法依赖于连续欧几里得空间中矢量化节点嵌入的相似性匹配。为了有效地处理大规模的相似度计算，最近发展了一些图结构数据的哈希技术。尽管在汉明空间中的检索效率很高，但先前的工作仍面临灾难性的性能衰减。在本文中，我们研究了使用双分图图卷积网络进行哈希的问题，以实现有效的Top-N搜索。我们提出了一种端到端的双分图图卷积哈希方法（BGCH），它由三个新颖而有效的模块组成：（1）自适应图卷积哈希，（2）潜在特征分散，以及（3）傅里叶序列化梯度估计。",
