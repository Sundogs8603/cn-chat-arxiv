    "translated_abstract": "印度的茶叶业有着悠久的历史，对印度经济有着重要的影响。印度是世界第二大茶叶生产国，阿萨姆和大吉岭是最知名的种茶地区。自从英国在19世纪20年代引进茶叶种植业以来，印度已经生产茶叶。今天，数百万人在茶叶行业工作，并且这个行业对于印度经济的贡献在收入方面非常显著。多年来，印度的茶叶生产方式已经发生了很大的改变，越来越倾向于采用有机和可持续的种植方式。茶叶行业还需要应对来自其他种茶国家的竞争，茶叶价格的波动和劳工相关问题等困难。尽管存在这些障碍，印度茶叶业仍在快速发展，并生产各种茶叶，如红茶、绿茶和印度奶茶。此外，茶叶行业还通过“茶叶旅游”鼓励旅游，让游客了解茶叶的制作过程和历史。",
