    "translated_abstract": "有效的建筑模式识别对于了解城市形态、自动化地图概括和可视化3D城市模型至关重要。大多数现有研究使用基于视觉感知规则和邻近图模型的独立于对象的方法来提取模式。然而，由于人类视觉是一个基于部件的系统，模式识别可能需要将形状分解为部件或将其分组为簇。现有方法可能无法识别所有视觉感知模式，并且邻近图模型可能效率低下。为了提高效率和效果，我们使用知识图谱集成多尺度数据，重点关注C型建筑模式识别。首先，我们使用属性图表示参与C型建筑模式识别的不同尺度内和跨尺度之间的建筑之间的关系。接下来，我们将这个知识图谱存储在图形数据库中，并将C型模式识别和丰富的规则转换为查询。",
