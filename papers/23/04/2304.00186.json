    "translated_abstract": "最近的文本到图像生成模型（如DreamBooth）在通过针对目标主题微调“专家模型”，生成高度自定义的图像方面取得了显著进展。然而，这个过程很昂贵，因为每个主题都必须学习一个新的专家模型。在本文中，我们提出了一个替代主题特定微调的面向主题的文本到图像生成器SuTI。给定一个新主题的少量演示，SuTI可以即时生成不同场景中主题的新版本，而无需进行任何主题特定的优化。SuTI由“徒弟学习”驱动，其中从大量基于主题的专家模型生成的数据中学习单个的徒弟模型。具体而言，我们从互联网挖掘了数百万个图像簇，每个图像簇都聚焦于一个特定的视觉主题。我们采用这些簇来训练大量专门针对不同视觉主题的专家模型。徒弟模型通过推断基于其文本描述的新主题的最佳专家模型并生成图像来学习。我们在各种基准数据集上展示了SuTI的有效性，表明它可以生成高品质的不同主题的图像，同时比基于微调的方法快得多。",
