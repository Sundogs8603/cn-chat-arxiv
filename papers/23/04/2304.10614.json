Denoising techniques can remove the noise but this technique can cause a significant loss of information. To detect anomalies in the time series we have proposed an attention free conditional autoencoder (AF-CA). We started from the autoencoder conditional model on which we added an Attention-Free LSTM layer \\cite{inzirillo2022attention} in order to make the anomaly detection capacity more reliable and to increase the power of anomaly detection. We compared the results of our Attention Free Conditional Autoencoder with those of an LSTM Autoencoder and clearly improved the explanatory power of the model and therefore the detection of anomaly in noisy time series.",

    "translated_abstract": "在时间序列中识别异常很困难，尤其是在存在大量噪声的情况下。降噪技术可以去除噪声，但这可能会导致信息的显著损失。为了检测时间序列中的异常，我们提出了一种无注意力条件自编码器(AF-CA)。我们从自编码器条件模型开始，添加了一个无注意力LSTM层\\cite{inzirillo2022attention}，以使异常检测能力更可靠，并增加异常检测的功率。我们将我们的Attention Free Conditional Autoencoder与LSTM Autoencoder的结果进行了比较，明显提高了模型的解释能力，因此可以更好地检测噪声时间序列中的异常。",
