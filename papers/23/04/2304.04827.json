    "abstract": "Lattices are a commonly used structure for the representation and analysis of relational and ontological knowledge. In particular, the analysis of these requires a decomposition of a large and high-dimensional lattice into a set of understandably large parts. With the present work we propose /ordinal motifs/ as analytical units of meaning. We study these ordinal substructures (or standard scales) through (full) scale-measures of formal contexts from the field of formal concept analysis. We show that the underlying decision problems are NP-complete and provide results on how one can incrementally identify ordinal motifs to save computational effort. Accompanying our theoretical results, we demonstrate how ordinal motifs can be leveraged to retrieve basic meaning from a medium sized ordinal data set.",
