    "translated_abstract": "本文总结了我们在第9和第10次Dialog System Technology Challenges（DSTC9和DSTC10）中为对话基于文档的任务作出的贡献。在两次迭代中，任务由三个子任务组成：首先检测当前回合是否需要知识，其次选择相关的知识文档，第三生成基于所选文档的回答。对于DSTC9，我们提出了不同的方法来使选择任务更有效率。其中最好的方法——分层选择，实际上比原始基线改进了结果，并提高了24倍速度。在DSTC10迭代中，挑战是要使经过书面对话训练的系统能够在嘈杂的自动语音识别转录中表现良好。因此，我们提出了数据增强技术来提高模型的鲁棒性，以及适应生成回答的风格，使其与前期对话相匹配的方法。此外，我们提出了一个嘈杂的通道模型来直接建模语音识别错误。实验结果表明，我们的方法在所有子任务上显著优于基线模型。",
