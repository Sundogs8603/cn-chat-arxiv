    "translated_abstract": "在一个形式背景中，序数因子是其关系的子集，形成概念格中的链，即对应于线性顺序的数据集的一部分。为了可视化形式上下文中的数据，Ganter和Glodeanu提出了基于两个序数因子的双图。为了使双图有用，重要的是这些因子尽可能包含更多数据点，即覆盖尽可能多的关系。本文研究这样的序数二次因子分解。首先，我们研究了省略序数二次因子分解的形式背景中两个因子的不相交性。然后，我们证明判定给定大小的二次因子分解是否存在是一个NP完全问题，这使得计算最大因子分解具有计算成本。最后，我们提供了算法Ord2Factor，它允许我们计算大的序数二次因子分解。",
