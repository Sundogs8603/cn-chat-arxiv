    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个模型，研究了内生匹配与偏好演变。在短期内，个体的主观偏好同时确定了他们匹配的对象和他们与配对伙伴之间的社会互动方式，从而为他们带来物质回报。物质回报反过来影响了偏好的长期演变。为了恰当地模拟“匹配-互动”过程，我们结合了稳定匹配和均衡概念。我们的研究强调了偏见主义，即与自己类似的人进行匹配的偏好，对塑造我们的结果的重要性。在完全信息下，拥有一种弱偏见主义和效率偏好的偏见高效型 - 在演化过程中脱颖而出，因为它能够强制个体之间进行正向择偶和高效互动。在信息不完全的情况下，排他性高效偏好型 - 具有强偏见主义和效率偏好，但不具备与自己相匹配的偏好 - 成为稳定的均衡结果。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study introduces a model that combines stable matching and equilibrium concepts to investigate preference evolution with endogenous matching. The findings highlight the role of parochialism, and suggest that moderate parochial efficient types can drive positive assortative matching and efficient play, while exclusionary efficient types emerge as stable outcomes under incomplete information."
