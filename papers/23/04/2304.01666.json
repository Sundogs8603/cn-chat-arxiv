    "translated_abstract": "语义转变检测 (SSD) 是指识别、解释和评估目标词可能随着时间发生的意义变化的任务。传统上，SSD 是由语言学家和社会科学家通过手动和耗时的活动来处理的。近年来，计算机方法基于自然语言处理和词嵌入技术得到越来越多的关注，以尽可能地自动化 SSD。特别是，在过去的三年中，几乎完全基于词汇的上下文嵌入模型取得了显着的进展，这些模型可以处理单词的多种用法/意义，并更好地捕捉相关的语义转变。本文综述了基于上下文嵌入的 SSD 方法（即 CSSDetection），并提出了一个以含义表示、时间感知和学习模态维度为特征的分类框架。利用该框架，我们对转变评估措施进行了回顾，并确定了上下文化 SSD 领域未来研究面临的挑战和机遇。",
