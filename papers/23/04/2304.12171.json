We introduce matrons, a natural structure that is dual to sublattices that generalizes existing structures such as matroids and polymatroids in combinatorial optimization and M-sets in discrete convex analysis. Our monotone comparative statics result is based on a natural order on matrons, which is dual in some sense to Veinott's strong set order on sublattices. As an application, we propose a deferred acceptance algorithm that operates in the case of divisible goods, and we study its convergence properties.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了针对子模最大化函数的单调比较静态学结果，此前的经典理论中是针对超模最大化函数的，该理论由Veinott、Topkis、Milgrom、Shannon等人提出。我们引入了matrons这一自然结构，它是对子格结构的对偶，可以推广到组合优化中的matroids和polymatroids，以及离散凸分析中的M-sets。我们的单调比较静态学结果基于matrons自然的排列，这种排列在某种意义上是对Veinott在子格上的强集合排列的对偶。作为应用，我们提出了一种能够处理可分配商品的延迟接受算法，并研究了其收敛性质。",
