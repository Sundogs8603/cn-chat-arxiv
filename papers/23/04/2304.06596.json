    "translated_abstract": "机器学习算法在多个重要决策过程中发挥着重要作用，包括定向广告展示、家庭贷款批准和犯罪行为预测等。鉴于这些算法的深远影响，关键在于它们运作应该公平，没有偏见或对某些群体的偏见。确保这些算法的公正性对于促进平等和避免歧视至关重要。为此，我们引入了一个带有组公平性约束的随机子集选择的统一框架。我们的问题涉及全局效用函数以及每个组的一组效用函数，其中一个组指共享相同属性（例如性别）的个体组。我们的目标是生成跨可行子集的分布，指定每个可行集的选择概率，以最大化全局效用函数并满足预定配额的要求。",
    "tldr": "该论文介绍了一种带有组公平性约束的随机子集选择的框架，并提出了一个全新的优化方法，可以优化一系列超出次模性范围的问题。在测试中，该框架可以实现组公平性而不牺牲太多效用。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a unified framework for randomized subset selection that incorporates group fairness constraints, and proposes a novel optimization approach that can optimize a wide range of objectives that are beyond submodularity. The framework is evaluated on several problems and shown to achieve group fairness without sacrificing too much utility."
