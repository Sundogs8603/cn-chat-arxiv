    "abstract": "The goal of temporal relation extraction is to infer the temporal relation between two events in the document. Supervised models are dominant in this task. In this work, we investigate ChatGPT's ability on zero-shot temporal relation extraction. We designed three different prompt techniques to break down the task and evaluate ChatGPT. Our experiments show that ChatGPT's performance has a large gap with that of supervised methods and can heavily rely on the design of prompts. We further demonstrate that ChatGPT can infer more small relation classes correctly than supervised methods. The current shortcomings of ChatGPT on temporal relation extraction are also discussed in this paper. We found that ChatGPT cannot keep consistency during temporal inference and it fails in actively long-dependency temporal inference.",

    "translated_abstract": "时间关系抽取的目标是推断文档中两个事件之间的时间关系。 监督模型在该任务中占主导地位。本研究旨在探究ChatGPT在零样本时间关系抽取方面的能力。我们设计了三种不同的提示技术来拆分任务并评估ChatGPT。我们的实验表明，ChatGPT的表现与监督方法存在很大差距，而且很大程度上依赖于提示的设计。我们进一步证明，与监督方法相比，ChatGPT可以更正确地推断出更多的小关系类。本文还讨论了ChatGPT在时间关系抽取方面的现有缺陷。我们发现，ChatGPT在时间推断过程中无法保持一致性，并且在主动长依赖时间推断中失败。",
