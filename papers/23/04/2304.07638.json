    "translated_abstract": "因果模型的框架提供了一种原则性的因果推理方法，今天已应用于许多科学领域。在这里，我们使用范畴论来形式化地解释弦图语言中的因果模型。一类称为网络图的弦图与有向无环图一一对应。使用具有“复制-丢弃”结构的对称单调范畴中的随机映射、函数或一般通道作为模型的组件，给出了这样一个图表来表示一个因果模型，将模型转化为一个可以直观并严格推理的单一数学对象。建立在Fong和Jacobs、Kissinger和Zanasi以及Fritz和Klingler之前的工作基础上，我们在cd-范畴中提出了因果模型和功能因果模型的图表定义，这扩展了因果贝叶斯网络和结构性因果模型，分别形式化了对模型的一般干预。",
