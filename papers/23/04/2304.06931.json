    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）作为一种去中心化的学习范式，在医疗保健领域得到了广泛应用，允许多个参与方在不泄露隐私的前提下协同训练模型。然而，以往的研究大多假定每个客户端拥有相同的标签集。事实上，医学专家往往只注释其知识领域或兴趣范围内的疾病。这意味着每个客户端的标签集可能是不同甚至是不相交的。本文提出了FedLSM框架以解决标签集不匹配问题。FedLSM采用不同的训练策略处理不同不确定性程度的数据，以有效利用未标记或部分标记的数据，并在分类层采用逐类别自适应聚合以避免客户端缺失标签时的不准确聚合。我们在两个公共实际医学图像数据集上评估了FedLSM，包括拥有112,120张胸透图像的胸部X射线诊断和皮肤病变诊断。",
