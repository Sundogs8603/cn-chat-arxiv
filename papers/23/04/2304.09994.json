    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型因其相对传统方法更高的准确性和效率，逐渐成为流行的洪水预测方法。但是，当前的机器学习方法通常依赖于单独的空间或时间特征分析，并对输入数据的类型、数量和维度存在限制。本研究提出了一个基于CNN-RNN的混合特征融合建模方法，用于城市洪水预测，将CNN在处理空间特征方面的优势和RNN在分析不同维度的时间序列方面的优势整合起来。这种方法允许进行静态和动态的洪水预测。应用贝叶斯优化来确定七个最具影响力的洪水驱动因素，并确定最佳组合策略。通过结合四个CNN（FCN，UNet，SegNet，DeepLabv3+）和三个RNN（LSTM，BiLSTM，GRU），最优混合模型被确定为LSTM-DeepLabv3+。该模型实现了最高的预测准确性（MAE、RMSE、NSE和KGE率）。",
