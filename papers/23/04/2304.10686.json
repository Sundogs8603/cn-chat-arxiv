    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种通用和鲁棒的多因素门控循环神经网络（GRU）基于深度学习（DL）模型，用于预测野火季节地区分布网络的电力负荷。该灵活的建模方法考虑数据输入结构、日历效应以及基于相关性的温度先导条件。与常规瞬时温度的使用相比，采用所提出的输入特征选择和温度先导关系使平均绝对百分比误差（MAPE）降低了30.73%%。我们的模型通用且应用于澳大利亚维多利亚州在2015-2020年野火季节期间的八个真实分布式网络中。我们展示了基于GRU的模型在每个步骤中始终优于另一个DL模型，即长短期记忆（LSTM），相对于平均均方误差和MAPE分别提高了10.06％和12.86％。还研究了对训练数据集中的大规模气候变异的敏感性，例如El Niño或La Niña。结果表明我们提出的模型对这种变异是鲁棒的。",
