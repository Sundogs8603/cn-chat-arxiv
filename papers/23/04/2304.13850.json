    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习（SSL）算法可以通过学习将自然图像的不同部分相互关联来产生有用的图像表示。然而，当被推向极端时，SSL模型会意外地记忆单个训练样本中的特定部分，而不是学习有意义的语义关联。在本研究中，我们对SSL模型中的意外记忆现象进行了系统研究，我们称之为“似曾相识”记忆。具体而言，我们展示了在给定训练模型和一个仅包含背景（如水、天空、草地）的训练图像裁剪后，可以高精度或甚至视觉重构地推断出前景对象。此外，我们展示了“似曾相识”记忆是不同SSL算法的普遍现象，并且会因某些设计选择而恶化，而且不能通过传统的评估表示质量的技术来检测。“似曾相识”记忆的研究",
