    "translated_abstract": "语义网络是理解如何从记忆中检索相关概念的有用工具。然而，大多数现有的网络方法使用成对连接表示记忆召回模式。成对连接忽略了更高阶的关联，即一次涉及两个以上概念的关系。这些更高阶的交互可能与大脑灰质结构特征，如兴奋、愉悦、熟悉度、性别等有关。我们通过引入特征丰富认知超图来克服这些限制，作为人类记忆的定量模型：（i）一起回忆的概念可以同时参与包含两个以上概念的超链接（认知超图方面）；（ii）每个概念都具有心理语言学特征向量（特征丰富方面）。我们从词汇联想数据中构建超图，并使用机器学习特征评估方法来预测概念特征。我们的结果表明，相对于成对连接和缺乏特征的网络模型，特征丰富认知超图在预测心理语言学特征方面表现更好。此外，我们还表明，涉及更高阶关联的超链接优先形成在具有相似心理语言学特征的概念之间。这表明，人类记忆的结构涉及反映共享认知维度的更高阶关联，这些维度可以用于将概念组织成语义空间。",
