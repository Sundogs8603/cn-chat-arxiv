Specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique by applying it to three different spin systems: the Ising model, the Potts model, and the Cellular Potts model. Our simulations show that our framework offers significant speedup compared to traditional simulation methods, thanks to its ability to execute code efficiently across different hardware architectures, including Graphical Processing Units and Tensor Processing Units.",
