    "translated_abstract": "准确可靠地预测个人出行方式选择对于发展多模式城市交通系统、进行交通规划和制定交通需求管理策略至关重要。传统的离散选择模型主导了建模方法几十年，但受到严格的模型假设和低的预测精度的困扰。近年来，机器学习（ML）模型，如神经网络和提升模型，被研究人员广泛用于出行方式选择预测，并取得了良好的效果。然而，尽管具有上乘的预测性能，但大量的ML方法，特别是神经网络模型部分，也受到过度拟合和繁琐的模型结构确定过程的限制。为了弥补这一差距，本研究提出了一种增强型多层感知机（MLP；一个神经网络），它具有两个隐藏层，用于出行方式选择预测；该MLP通过 XGBoost（一种提升方法）进行特征选择和网格搜索以增强模型性能。",
