    "translated_abstract": "视觉信息抽取（VIE）在文档智能领域扮演着重要角色，通常被划分为语义实体识别（SER）和关系提取（RE）两个任务。尽管文档的预训练模型在SER方面已经取得了实质性进展，但是现有模型大都采用隐式方式学习几何形态信息，这种方式对于RE任务不够有效，因为对于RE而言几何形态信息尤其重要。此外，我们发现对于RE而言，预训练阶段和微调阶段之间的目标间隙也影响了RE性能的提升。因此，本文提出了一个多模型框架GeoLayoutLM，能够显式地建模预训练的几何关系，我们称之为几何预训练。GeoLayoutLM通过三个特别设计的几何相关预训练任务实现了几何预训练。此外，为了弥补目标间隙，新颖的关系头检测任务也在RE的微调阶段引入。GeoLayoutLM在几个基准数据集上都取得了SER和RE任务的最优结果，证明了本方法的有效性和通用性。",
