    "abstract": "Certified defense methods against adversarial perturbations have been recently investigated in the black-box setting with a zeroth-order (ZO) perspective. However, these methods suffer from high model variance with low performance on high-dimensional datasets due to the ineffective design of the denoiser and are limited in their utilization of ZO techniques. To this end, we propose a certified ZO preprocessing technique for removing adversarial perturbations from the attacked image in the black-box setting using only model queries. We propose a robust UNet denoiser (RDUNet) that ensures the robustness of black-box models trained on high-dimensional datasets. We propose a novel black-box denoised smoothing (DS) defense mechanism, ZO-RUDS, by prepending our RDUNet to the black-box model, ensuring black-box defense. We further propose ZO-AE-RUDS in which RDUNet followed by autoencoder (AE) is prepended to the black-box model. We perform extensive experiments on four classification dataset",

    "translated_abstract": "最近黑盒设置中对于对抗性扰动的认证防御方法已经从零阶角度进行了研究，然而由于去噪器的设计不够有效，这些方法在高维数据集上存在高模型方差和低性能，且在使用零阶技术时存在局限性。为此，我们提出了一种认证的零阶预处理技术，仅使用模型查询即可从受攻击图像中去除对抗性扰动。我们提出了一种鲁棒的UNet去噪器（RDUNet），确保了对于高维数据集上训练的黑盒模型的鲁棒性。我们进一步提出了黑盒去噪平滑（DS）防御机制ZO-RUDS，通过将我们的RDUNet预置于黑盒模型之前，确保黑盒防御。我们还提出了ZO-AE-RUDS，在黑盒模型之前使用RDUNet和自编码器(AE)。我们在四个分类数据集上进行了广泛的实验。",

A novel black-box defense mechanism, ZO-RUDS or ZO-AE-RUDS, is also proposed by prepending RDUNet with denoised smoothing (DS) or autoencoder (AE) to the black-box model, which improves the model's robustness."
