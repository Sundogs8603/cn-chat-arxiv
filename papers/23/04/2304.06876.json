    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于采样的策略综合算法，用于具有复杂连续动力学和时间和可达性约束的非确定性混合系统。我们将混合系统的演化视为一个双人游戏，其中非确定性是一个对手玩家，其目标是阻止实现时间和可达性目标。旨在合成一种获胜策略——一种反应（鲁棒）策略，它保证在对手玩家的所有可能移动下满足目标。该方法基于在混合空间中生长（搜索）游戏树，通过将基于采样的规划方法与一种用于选择和改进部分策略的新型乘客舱机技术相结合。我们提供的条件下，算法是概率上完备的，即，如果存在获胜策略，该算法几乎肯定会找到它。案例研究和基准结果表明，该算法具有广泛的适用性，并在可扩展性和效率方面始终优于最新技术水平。",
