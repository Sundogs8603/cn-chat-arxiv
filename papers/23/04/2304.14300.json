    "translated_abstract": "传统的葡萄糖 - 胰岛素动力学模型依赖于选择用于在实验室环境中拟合观察结果的启发式参数，但这些模型无法描述日常生活中的葡萄糖动力学。失败的一个原因是在餐后葡萄糖吸收速率的描述中。餐的宏量营养成分对吸收剖面有微妙的影响，这很难通过机械建模来实现。本文提出了从葡萄糖 - 胰岛素数据和餐饮协变量中学习宏量营养成分影响的方法。鉴于宏量营养信息和餐食时间，我们使用神经网络来预测个人的葡萄糖吸收率。我们在葡萄糖动力学的微分方程中使用这个神经速率函数作为控制函数，从而实现端到端训练。在模拟数据上，我们的方法能够紧密地逼近真实的吸收速率，比启发式参数化获得更好的预测效果，尽管只观察到葡萄糖、胰岛素两项。",
