    "translated_abstract": "体积数据在许多科学学科中常常出现，如医学、物理学和生物学等领域。专家们依赖于强大的科学可视化技术从数据中提取有价值的见解。近年来，路径追踪被认为是体积渲染的首选方法，因为它的实时全球光照效果非常真实。然而，实时体积路径追踪往往会受到随机噪声和长时间的收敛时间的限制，从而限制了交互式探索。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法，以实现体积数据可视化的实时全局光照。我们开发了Photon Field Networks——一种相位函数感知、多光源神经表示的间接体积全局光照技术。这些场在我们预先计算的多相光子缓存上进行训练。训练可以在几秒钟内完成，之后这些场就可以用于各种渲染任务。为了展示其潜力，我们开发了一个自定义的神经路径追踪器，使得我们的光子场可以实现在体积数据中实现动态全局光照和材质变化的交互式帧率。",
