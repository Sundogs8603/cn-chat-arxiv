Under such identity regime, an accurate and efficient cohort building algorithm is desired to group users with similar characteristics. In this paper, we propose a scalable $K$-anonymous cohort building algorithm called {\\em consecutive consistent weighted sampling} (CCWS). The proposed method combines the spirit of the ($p$-powered) consistent weighted sampling and hierarchical clustering, so that the $K$-anonymity is ensured by enforcing a lower bound on the size of cohorts. Evaluations on a LinkedIn dataset consisting of $>70$M users and ads campaigns demonstrate that CCWS achieves substantial improvements over several hashing-based methods including sign random projections (SignRP), minwise hashing (MinHash), as well as the vanilla CWS.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了在保护用户隐私的前提下检索个性化广告系列和创意，数字广告正在从基于成员的身份转向基于小组的身份。在这种身份制度下，需要一种准确高效的组队算法来将具有相似特征的用户分组。本文提出了一种可扩展的 K-匿名组队算法，称为连续一致加权抽样（CCWS）。该方法将一致加权抽样（p -powered）和分层聚类的思想结合起来，从而通过强制限制小组大小的下限来确保 K-匿名性。在由 70 多个百万用户和广告系列组成的 LinkedIn 数据集上的评估显示，CCWS 相对于几种基于哈希的方法（包括 SignRP、MinHash 以及基本的 CWS）具有显着的改进。",
