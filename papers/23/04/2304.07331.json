    "abstract": "It is well known that in the presence of heteroscedasticity ordinary least squares estimator is not efficient. I propose a generalized automatic least squares estimator (GALS) that makes partial correction of heteroscedasticity based on a (potentially) misspecified model without a pretest. Such an estimator is guaranteed to be at least as efficient as either OLS or WLS but can provide some asymptotic efficiency gains over OLS if the misspecified model is approximately correct. If the heteroscedasticity model is correct, the proposed estimator achieves full asymptotic efficiency. The idea is to frame moment conditions corresponding to OLS and WLS squares based on miss-specified heteroscedasticity as a joint generalized method of moments estimation problem. The resulting optimal GMM estimator is equivalent to a feasible GLS with estimated weight matrix. I also propose an optimal GMM variance-covariance estimator for GALS to account for any remaining heteroscedasticity in the residuals.",

    "translated_abstract": "众所周知，在存在异方差情况下，普通最小二乘估计量并不高效。本文提出了一种广义自动最小二乘估计量(GALS)，该估计量基于（可能）错误的模型进行异方差的部分修正，并可保证至少与OLS或WLS一样高效，但在误差模型近似正确时可以提供一些渐近效率增益。 如果异方差模型是正确的，则所提出的估计器实现了完全的渐近效率。 方法是将与OLS和WLS方法对应的时刻条件框架化为基于广义矩法的联合估计问题，然后获得最优的GMM估计器，该估计器等价于一个带有估计权重矩阵的可行的GLS估计器。我们还提出了一种最优的GMM方差-协方差估计量，用于解释残差中的任何剩余异方差。",

If the misspecified model is approximately correct, some asymptotic efficiency gains over OLS can be obtained. GALS is based on a joint generalized method of moments estimation problem, and is equivalent to a feasible GLS estimator with an estimated weight matrix."
