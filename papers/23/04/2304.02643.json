    "abstract": "We introduce the Segment Anything (SA) project: a new task, model, and dataset for image segmentation. Using our efficient model in a data collection loop, we built the largest segmentation dataset to date (by far), with over 1 billion masks on 11M licensed and privacy respecting images. The model is designed and trained to be promptable, so it can transfer zero-shot to new image distributions and tasks. We evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks and find that its zero-shot performance is impressive -- often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised results. We are releasing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and corresponding dataset (SA-1B) of 1B masks and 11M images at https://segment-anything.com to foster research into foundation models for computer vision.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了“Segment Anything（SA）”项目，这是一个新的图像分割任务、模型和数据集。我们使用高效的模型在数据收集循环中构建了到目前为止最大的分割数据集，涵盖1100万个许可和隐私尊重的图像，其中包含10亿个掩膜。该模型经过设计和训练，可以快速响应，因此可以在新的图像分布和任务中进行零-shot 任务迁移。我们对其在众多任务中的表现进行了评估，并发现其零-shot 性能令人印象深刻 -- 通常是竞争对手或甚至超过之前的完全监督结果。我们正在 https://segment-anything.com 上发布 Segment Anything Model（SAM）和相应的数据集（SA-1B），以促进计算机视觉基础模型研究的发展。",
