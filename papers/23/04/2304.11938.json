    "translated_abstract": "最近，ChatGPT LLM引起了极大关注：它可以用作讨论源代码的聊天机器人，提示建议更改，提供描述甚至生成代码。典型的演示通常集中在现有的基准上，这些基准可能在模型训练中使用过（即数据泄漏）。为了评估将LLM用作程序员的有用助手机器人的可行性，我们必须评估其在未知问题上的实际能力以及其对各种任务的能力。在本文中，我们介绍了ChatGPT作为全自动编程助手的潜力的经验研究，重点关注代码生成、程序修复和代码摘要的任务。该研究调查了ChatGPT在常见编程问题上的表现，并将其与两个基准上的最先进方法进行了比较。在多个发现中，我们的研究显示ChatGPT在处理常见编程问题方面是有效的。然而，我们的实验也揭示了其局限性。",
