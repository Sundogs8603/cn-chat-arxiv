    "abstract": "Low-count PET is an efficient way to reduce radiation exposure and acquisition time, but the reconstructed images often suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus affecting diagnosis and other downstream tasks. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential in improving low-count PET image quality, but acquiring a large, centralized, and diverse dataset from multiple institutions for training a robust model is difficult due to privacy and security concerns of patient data. Moreover, low-count PET data at different institutions may have different data distribution, thus requiring personalized models. While previous federated learning (FL) algorithms enable multi-institution collaborative training without the need of aggregating local data, addressing the large domain shift in the application of multi-institutional low-count PET denoising remains a challenge and is still highly under-explored.

    "translated_abstract": "低计数PET是降低辐射暴露和采集时间的有效方法，但重建图像往往受到信噪比低的影响，从而影响诊断和其他下游任务。深度学习的最新进展在改善低计数PET图像质量方面显示出巨大潜力，但由于患者数据的隐私和安全问题，从多个机构获取大型、集中和多样化的数据集以训练强大的模型是困难的。此外，不同机构的低计数PET数据可能具有不同的数据分布，因此需要个性化的模型。虽然之前的联邦学习算法可以在不需要聚合本地数据的情况下实现多机构的协作训练，但解决多机构低计数PET去噪应用中的领域差异仍然是一个挑战，并且还未完全探索。在这项工作中，我们提出了FedFTN，一种个性化的联邦学习策略。",
