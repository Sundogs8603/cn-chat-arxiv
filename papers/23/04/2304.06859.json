    "translated_abstract": "联合函数在金融经济学以及其他应用数学领域广泛使用，但选择联合函数时存在很大的武断性。本文提出了“自然联合函数”的概念，该函数将两个分布嵌入到某个空间中，使它们之间的Wasserstein距离最小化。文中对它的输运性质和流体力学解释进行了探讨，并给出了两个具有金融意义的分布实例。自然联合函数可以通过线性规划方法进行简明估计。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种新的“自然联合函数”的概念，可通过线性规划方法进行简单估计，在金融经济学中具有应用潜力。",

The natural copula minimizes the Wasserstein distance between distributions in some embedded space. Transport properties and hydrodynamic interpretation are also discussed."
