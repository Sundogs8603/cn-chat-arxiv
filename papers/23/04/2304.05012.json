    "abstract": "Semantic feature norms, lists of features that concepts do and do not possess, have played a central role in characterizing human conceptual knowledge, but require extensive human labor. Large language models (LLMs) offer a novel avenue for the automatic generation of such feature lists, but are prone to significant error. Here, we present a new method for combining a learned model of human lexical-semantics from limited data with LLM-generated data to efficiently generate high-quality feature norms.",
