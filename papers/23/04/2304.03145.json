    "translated_abstract": "问答（QA）模型在机器阅读理解（MRC）任务中取得了令人信服的结果。最近，这些模型已经证明在如SQuAD等数据集的测试集上表现优于人类，但它们的稳健性并不保证。当使用对抗生成的示例进行评估时，QA模型的脆弱性会暴露出来，表现出性能下降。在本研究中，我们探讨了MRC模型对来自低资源地区（如非洲）的实体重命名的鲁棒性。我们提出了EntSwap，一种测试时扰动方法，用于创建一个实体已被重命名的测试集。特别地，我们重命名类型为国家，人物，国籍，位置，组织和城市的实体，以创建AfriSQuAD2。使用扰动测试集，我们评估了三种流行的MRC模型的鲁棒性。我们发现，与基准模型相比，大模型在新实体上表现良好。此外，我们的分析表明，人名实体类型具有高度的特异性和不确定性。",
