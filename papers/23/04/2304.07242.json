    "abstract": "The pandemic of COVID-19 has inspired extensive works across different research fields. Existing literature and knowledge platforms on COVID-19 only focus on collecting papers on biology and medicine, neglecting the interdisciplinary efforts, which hurdles knowledge sharing and research collaborations between fields to address the problem. Studying interdisciplinary researches requires effective paper category classification and efficient cross-domain knowledge extraction and integration. In this work, we propose Covidia, COVID-19 interdisciplinary academic knowledge graph to bridge the gap between knowledge of COVID-19 on different domains. We design frameworks based on contrastive learning for disciplinary classification, and propose a new academic knowledge graph scheme for entity extraction, relation classification and ontology management in accordance with interdisciplinary researches. Based on Covidia, we also establish knowledge discovery benchmarks for finding COVID-19 research",

    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19 疫情激发了不同领域广泛的研究工作。现有的COVID-19文献和知识平台只关注生物学和医学领域的论文收集，忽略了跨学科的努力，这妨碍了领域间的知识共享和研究合作以解决问题。研究跨学科研究需要有效的论文分类和高效的跨领域知识提取和整合。在这项工作中，我们提出Covidia，COVID-19跨学科学术知识图谱，以弥合不同领域对COVID-19知识的差距。我们基于对比学习设计框架进行学科分类，并提出了一种新的学术知识图谱方案，用于交叉领域的实体提取、关系分类和本体论管理。基于Covidia，我们还建立了发现COVID-19研究的知识发现基准。",
