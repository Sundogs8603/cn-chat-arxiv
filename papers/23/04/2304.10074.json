    "translated_abstract": "本文提供了关于如何利用图神经网络（GNN）进行多节点表示学习的理论，其中我们有兴趣学习由多个节点组成的节点集的表示，如一个链接。现有的GNN主要设计用于学习单个节点表示。当我们想要学习涉及多个节点的节点集表示时，以前的工作中常见的做法是直接聚合GNN获得的单节点表示。本文展示了这种方法的一个基本局限性，即不能捕捉节点集中多个节点之间的依赖关系，同时也认为直接聚合各个节点的表示无法为多个节点产生有效的联合表示。一个直接的解决方案是区分目标节点和其他节点。基于这个想法，我们提出了“标签技巧”，它首先根据与目标节点集的关系标记图中的节点。",
