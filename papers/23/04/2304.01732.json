    "translated_abstract": "预测性模拟在从天气预报到材料设计的各种应用中都至关重要。这些模拟的准确性取决于其捕获有效的系统动态的能力。大规模并行模拟通过解析所有时空尺度来预测系统动态，往往以成本作为代价阻止了实验。另一方面，降阶模型速度快，但常常受到系统动力学线性化和所采用的启发式封闭的限制。我们提出了一个新的系统性框架，将大规模模拟与降阶模型连接起来，以自适应方式提取和预测多尺度系统的有效动力学（AdaLED）。AdaLED采用自编码器来识别系统动态的降阶表示，并使用概率循环神经网络（RNNs）的集合作为潜在时间步进器。该框架在计算求解器和替代模型之间交替，加速学习动力学同时保留了解的动态特征。",
