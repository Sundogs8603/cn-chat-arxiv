    "abstract": "Systems and blockchains often have security vulnerabilities and can be attacked by adversaries, with potentially significant negative consequences. Therefore, organizations and blockchain infrastructure providers increasingly rely on bug bounty programs, where external individuals probe the system and report any vulnerabilities (bugs) in exchange for monetary rewards (bounty). We develop a contest model for bug bounty programs with an arbitrary number of agents who decide whether to undertake a costly search for bugs or not. Search costs are private information. Besides characterizing the ensuing equilibria, we show that even inviting an unlimited crowd does not guarantee that bugs are found. Adding paid agents can increase the efficiency of the bug bounty scheme although the crowd that is attracted becomes smaller. Finally, adding (known) bugs increases the likelihood that unknown bugs are found, but to limit reward payments it may be optimal to add them only with some probability.",

    "translated_abstract": "系统和区块链往往存在安全漏洞，可能会被攻击者攻击，产生重大负面影响。因此，组织和区块链基础设施提供者越来越依赖漏洞赏金计划，外部个人探查系统并报告任何漏洞（缺陷），以换取货币奖励（赏金）。我们开发了一个适用于漏洞赏金计划的竞赛模型，其中有任意数量的代理决定是否进行耗费高昂的漏洞搜索。搜索成本是私人信息。除了表征发生的均衡外，我们还表明，即使邀请一个无限数量的人，也不能保证找到漏洞。添加有偿代理可以提高漏洞赏金计划的效率，尽管吸引的人数变少。最后，添加（已知的）漏洞可以增加发现未知漏洞的可能性，但出于限制奖励支付的目的，最好只以某种概率添加它们。",
    "tldr": "该论文讨论了漏洞赏金计划的竞赛模型和相关策略，包括如何加入有偿代理以提高计划效率、如何指定已知漏洞的添加概率以限制奖励支付、以及为什么邀请无限数量的人不能保证找到漏洞。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper discusses a contest model for bug bounty programs and related strategies, including adding paid agents to increase efficiency, specifying the probability of adding known bugs to limit reward payments, and the limitation of inviting an unlimited number of people to ensure finding bugs."
