    "abstract": "From health to education, income impacts a huge range of life choices. Many papers have leveraged data from online social networks to study precisely this. In this paper, we ask the opposite question: do different levels of income result in different online behaviors? We demonstrate it does. We present the first large-scale study of Nextdoor, a popular location-based social network. We collect 2.6 Million posts from 64,283 neighborhoods in the United States and 3,325 neighborhoods in the United Kingdom, to examine whether online discourse reflects the income and income inequality of a neighborhood. We show that posts from neighborhoods with different income indeed differ, e.g. richer neighborhoods have a more positive sentiment and discuss crimes more, even though their actual crime rates are much lower. We then show that user-generated content can predict both income and inequality. We train multiple machine learning models and predict both income (R-Square=0.841) and inequality (R-Sq",

    "translated_abstract": "收入影响着生活中很多选择，从健康到教育。许多研究都利用在线社交网络的数据研究此问题。但在本文中，我们提出了一个相反的问题：不同收入水平是否导致不同的在线行为？我们证明了确实是如此。我们展示了第一个Nextdoor社交网络的大规模研究，在美国的64,283个社区和英国的3,325个社区收集了2.6万篇帖子，以研究在线话语是否反映了社区的收入和收入不平等。我们发现不同收入的社区的帖子确实不同，比如更富裕的社区情感更积极，更多地讨论犯罪，尽管实际犯罪率要低得多。然后，我们展示了用户生成内容可预测收入和不平等。我们训练了多个机器学习模型，预测了收入（R-Square=0.841）和不平等（R-Sq…",
