The ability to accurately describe changes occurring in multi-temporal remote sensing images is becoming increasingly important for geospatial understanding and land planning. Unlike natural image change captioning tasks, remote sensing change captioning aims to capture the most significant changes, irrespective of various influential factors such as illumination, seasonal effects, and complex land covers. In this study, we highlight the significance of accurately describing changes in remote sensing images and present a comparison of the change captioning task for natural and synthetic images and remote sensing images. To address the challenge of generating accurate captions, we propose an attentive changes-to-captions network, called Chg2Cap for short, for bi-temporal remote sensing images.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，先进的研究集中在使用自然语言处理（NLP）技术直接学习和分析遥感图像。准确描述多时相遥感图像中发生的变化对于地理空间理解和土地规划变得越来越重要。与自然图像变化描述任务不同，遥感变化描述旨在捕捉最显著的变化，不受照明、季节效应和复杂地物覆盖等各种影响因素的限制。在本研究中，我们强调准确描述遥感图像变化的重要性，并对自然和合成图像以及遥感图像的变化描述任务进行了比较。为了应对生成准确描述的挑战，我们提出了一个称为Chg2Cap的关注变化到描述网络，用于处理两时相的遥感图像。该网络由三个主要部分组成。",
