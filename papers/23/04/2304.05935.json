Three analytical methods, including the Fixed Effect model, Random Effect model, and Pooled Ordinary Least Square (POLS) method, are employed to analyze two versions of the capital adequacy ratio, namely the Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and Tier 1 Capital Ratio. The study reveals that capital adequacy is significantly affected by several independent variables, with leverage and liquidity risk having a negative and positive relationship, respectively. Additionally, the study finds a positive correlation between real GDP and net profit and capital adequacy, while inflation has a negative correlation. For the Tier 1 Ratio, the study shows no significant relationship betweenleverage and liquidity risk, but a positive correlation with the number of employees, net profit, and real GDP, while a negative correlation with size and",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究使用2013年至2019年28家银行的面板数据，运用固定效应模型、随机效应模型和混合普通最小二乘法来分析资本充足率和一级资本比率。研究发现，资本充足率受多个自变量显著影响，杠杆率和流动性风险分别呈负相关和正相关。此外，研究还发现，实际GDP和净利润与资本充足率呈正相关，而通货膨胀呈负相关。对于一级资本比率而言，研究显示杠杆率和流动性风险之间没有显著关系，但是员工数量、净利润和实际GDP与之呈正相关，而规模和ROA呈负相关。",
