    "abstract": "The problem of continual learning has attracted rising attention in recent years. However, few works have questioned the commonly used learning setup, based on a task curriculum of random class. This differs significantly from human continual learning, which is guided by taxonomic curricula. In this work, we propose the Taxonomic Class Incremental Learning (TCIL) problem. In TCIL, the task sequence is organized based on a taxonomic class tree. We unify existing approaches to CIL and taxonomic learning as parameter inheritance schemes and introduce a new such scheme for the TCIL learning. This enables the incremental transfer of knowledge from ancestor to descendant class of a class taxonomy through parameter inheritance. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100 show the effectiveness of the proposed TCIL method, which outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2% in terms of final accuracy on CIFAR-100 and 3% on ImageNet-100.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，连续学习问题引起了越来越多的关注。然而，很少有人质疑基于随机类任务课程的常用学习设置。这与人类连续学习有很大区别，后者是由分类学课程引导的。在本文中，我们提出了分类学类别增量学习（TCIL）问题。在TCIL中，任务序列基于分类学类别树进行组织。我们将现有的CIL和分类学习方法统一为参数继承方案，并引入一种新的TCIL学习方案。这使得从类别分类学的祖先转移到子孙类别的知识的增量转移成为可能。在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-100上的实验表明，所提出的TCIL方法具有很好的效果，其最终准确率在CIFAR-100上比现有SOTA方法高出2％，在ImageNet-100上比现有SOTA方法高出3％。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a learning task setting method based on the taxonomic class tree, called Taxonomic Class Incremental Learning (TCIL), which uses parameter inheritance scheme to achieve incremental transfer of knowledge from ancestor to descendant class of a class taxonomy. Compared with existing SOTA methods, TCIL achieves 2% and 3% accuracy improvement on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100, respectively."
