    "translated_abstract": "由于解空间中的非唯一性、对称性和分岔等复杂行为，解决具有多个解的非线性微分方程（DEs）的反问题是一项具有挑战性的任务。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了同伦物理知识神经网络（HomPINNs），这是一种利用同伦连续和神经网络（NNs）来解决反问题的新框架。所提出的框架首先使用NNs同时逼近已知观测结果和符合DEs的约束条件。通过利用同伦连续方法，逼近可追踪观察结果以确定多个解并解决反问题。实验涵盖在一维DEs上测试所提出的方法的性能，并应用它来解决二维Gray-Scott模拟。我们的研究结果表明，所提出的方法是可伸缩且适应性强的，为解决具有多个解的DEs提供了有效的解决方案。",
