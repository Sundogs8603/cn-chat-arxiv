    "translated_abstract": "从高维分布中采样是统计研究和实践中的一个基本问题。但是，当目标密度函数不规范化且包含孤立模式时，就会出现巨大的挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们通过拟合一个被称为输运映射的可逆变换映射（在参考概率测量和目标分布之间），使得通过输运映射将参考样本推向前沿即可实现从目标分布中进行采样。我们通过使用Wasserstein梯度流理论理论分析了现有的基于输运的采样方法的局限性，并提出了一种名为TemperFlow的新方法来解决多模态问题。TemperFlow自适应地学习一系列温度分布，以逐步接近目标分布，并证明它克服了现有方法的局限性。各种实验证明了这种新型采样器相对于现有采样方法的卓越性能。",
