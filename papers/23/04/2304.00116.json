    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型 (LLM) 在生成各种主题的类人文本方面展示了其能力，显著地改变了人工智能的格局。然而，尽管它们具有令人印象深刻的能力，但 LLM 缺乏最近的信息，并且常常使用不够准确的语言，这在需要准确性的领域比如气候变化中可能会有害。在本研究中，我们利用最新的想法来利用 LLM 的潜力，将它们视为可以访问包含关于组织、机构和公司的最新和准确信息的数据库的代理。我们通过一个原型代理演示了我们的方法的有效性，该代理从 ClimateWatch (https://www.climatewatchdata.org/) 检索排放数据并利用常规 Google 搜索。通过将这些资源与 LLM 集成，我们的方法克服了与不精确语言相关的限制，在气候变化等领域提供了更可靠和准确的信息。",
