    "translated_abstract": "最近提出采用图马尔可夫神经网络（GMNN）改进常规图神经网络（GNN），将标签依赖性纳入半监督节点分类任务中。GMNN从理论上以严谨的方式解决问题，并使用三类信息来预测标签。与常规的GNN一样，他们使用节点特征和图结构，但他们还利用相邻节点标签的信息，提高预测的准确性。本文介绍了一个名为WikiVitals的新数据集，其中包含48k个互相引用的维基百科文章，被分类为32个类别，由2.3M边连接。我们的目标是对GMNN对这个数据集的贡献的三种不同信息源进行严格评估：文章内容、文章互相之间的连接以及标签之间的相关性。为此，我们采用了一种最近提出的适用于GNN的样本外测试方法，并将其适用于GMNN。我们的实验结果显示，GMNN在此数据集上始终优于GNN，并且标签相关性是帮助GMNN实现这些增益的关键信息源。",
