    "abstract": "We derive a nonparametric higher-order asymptotic expansion for small-time changes of conditional characteristic functions of It\\^o semimartingale increments. The asymptotics setup is of joint type: both the length of the time interval of the increment of the underlying process and the time gap between evaluating the conditional characteristic function are shrinking. The spot semimartingale characteristics of the underlying process as well as their spot semimartingale characteristics appear as leading terms in the derived asymptotic expansions. The analysis applies to a general class of It\\^o semimartingales that includes in particular L\\'evy-driven SDEs and time-changed L\\'evy processes. The asymptotic expansion results are of direct use for constructing nonparametric estimates pertaining to the stochastic volatility dynamics of an asset from high-frequency data of options written on the underlying asset.",
