    "translated_abstract": "目前对于对抗性鲁棒性的研究主要集中在聚合一组数据样本的局部鲁棒性结果上，以评估和排名不同的模型。然而，局部统计量可能无法很好地代表基础未知数据分布的真正全局鲁棒性。为了解决这一挑战，本文首次尝试提出了一个新的框架——GREAT分数，用于使用生成模型对对抗性扰动进行全局鲁棒性评估。GREAT分数正式具有一个全局统计量的物理意义，捕捉来自生成模型的所有样本中的平均认证防攻击扰动水平。对于有限样本评估，我们还推导出样本复杂度和样本均值与真实均值之间的概率保证。GREAT分数有几个优点：（1）使用GREAT分数进行鲁棒性评估高效而且规模可扩展，无需运行对抗性攻击。",
