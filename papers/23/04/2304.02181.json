    "abstract": "With advances seen in deep learning, voice-based applications are burgeoning, ranging from personal assistants, affective computing, to remote disease diagnostics. As the voice contains both linguistic and paralinguistic information (e.g., vocal pitch, intonation, speech rate, loudness), there is growing interest in voice anonymization to preserve speaker privacy and identity. Voice privacy challenges have emerged over the last few years and focus has been placed on removing speaker identity while keeping linguistic content intact. For affective computing and disease monitoring applications, however, the paralinguistic content may be more critical. Unfortunately, the effects that anonymization may have on these systems are still largely unknown. In this paper, we fill this gap and focus on one particular health monitoring application: speech-based COVID-19 diagnosis. We test two popular anonymization methods and their impact on five different state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnostic system",

    "translated_abstract": "随着深度学习的发展，基于语音的应用正蓬勃发展，从个人助理、情感计算到远程疾病诊断。由于声音同时包含语言和语用信息（如语音音调、语调、语速、声音大小），因此保护说话者的隐私和身份的声音匿名化引起了广泛的关注。近年来，声音隐私问题已经出现，重点是去除说话者身份，同时保留语言内容。然而，对于情感计算和疾病监测应用而言，语用内容可能更为关键。遗憾的是，匿名化可能对这些系统产生的影响仍然不明确。在本文中，我们填补了这个空白，并专注于一个特定的健康监测应用：基于语音的COVID-19诊断。我们测试了两种流行的匿名化方法及其对五种最先进的COVID-19诊断系统的影响。",
