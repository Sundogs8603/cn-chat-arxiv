    "translated_abstract": "随着神经算子的兴起，科学机器学习提供了量化与高保真数值模拟相关的不确定性的新解决方案。传统的神经网络，如卷积神经网络（CNN）或物理信息神经网络（PINN），受到预定义配置的局限，并且只能预测解的解。使用神经算子，可以学习具有不同参数的偏微分方程的一般解，例如弹性波方程。地震学中应用神经算子的应用很少，都仅限于二维设置，尽管三维效应的重要性是众所周知的。在这项工作中，我们应用傅立叶神经算子（FNO）来预测来自3D地质描述的地面运动时间序列。我们使用高保真度模拟代码SEM3D建立了一个由30,000个不同地质构造生成的地面运动的广泛数据库。借助这个数据库，我们训练了一个FNO代理模型，可以准确预测由新地质构造引起的地面运动时间序列。我们的模型在预测精度和计算效率方面明显优于传统的机器学习模型。",
