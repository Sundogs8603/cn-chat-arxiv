    "abstract": "One of the most popular club football tournaments, the UEFA Champions League, will see a fundamental reform from the 2024/25 season: the traditional group stage will be replaced by one league where each of the 36 teams plays eight matches. Since the ranking is still based on the results of these matches, fairness requires guaranteeing that the opponents of the clubs are of the same strength. This paper investigates whether the currently used rating of the teams, the UEFA club coefficient, can be improved by taking the games played in the national leagues into account. According to our logistic regression models, a variant of the Elo method provides a higher accuracy in forecasting Champions League matches. Therefore, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is encouraged to follow the example of the FIFA World Ranking and reform the calculation of the coefficients in order to avoid unbalanced schedules in the novel tournament format of the Champions League.",

    "translated_abstract": "从2024/25赛季开始，《欧洲冠军联赛》将进行一个重大改革：传统的小组赛阶段将被一个联赛阶段所取代，其中的36个球队中每个队将参加8场比赛。由于排名仍然基于这些比赛的结果，公平需要确保每个俱乐部的对手实力相同。本文研究了当前使用的球队排名方法——UEFA俱乐部系数能否通过考虑国内联赛的比赛结果进行改进。根据我们的逻辑回归模型，Elo方法的一种变体在预测欧洲冠军联赛比赛方面具有更高的准确性。因此，我们建议欧洲足球协会（UEFA）仿效国际足球联合会世界排名的做法，改革系数的计算方式，以避免欧洲冠军联赛的新赛制中出现不平衡的赛程安排。",
