    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在$\\mathbb{R}^d$上样本目标密度的元卡洛调整朗之万（MALA）的混合时间。我们假设目标密度满足$\\psi_\\mu$-等周和它的黑塞矩阵的trace和算子范数分别受$L$和$\\Upsilon$的限制。我们的主要结论是，从热启动开始，为了达到$\\epsilon$总变差距离，MALA在$O\\left(\\frac{(L\\Upsilon)^{\\frac12}}{\\psi_\\mu^2} \\log\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)\\right)$次迭代中混合。值得注意的是，该结果不仅适用于对数凹采样设置，而且混合时间仅取决于$\\Upsilon$，而不是其上界$Ld$。在$m$-强对数凹和$L$-光滑采样设置中，我们的界限恢复了以前的MALA的最小值混合界限。",
    "tldr": "本文证明了，在光滑和等周条件下，MALA的混合时间仅与Hessian矩阵的trace有关，而与其算子范数和log-concave没有关系。",
