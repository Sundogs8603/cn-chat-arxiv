    "translated_abstract": "最近Chatbots等聊天机器人引起了极大的关注。对于BPM应用来说，如何应用聊天机器人来生成商业价值通常是不明确的。因此，本文旨在系统地分析现有的聊天机器人对于支持对话式流程建模作为面向流程的能力的支持。该研究识别了沿流程生命周期的应用场景，然后进行了对话式流程建模的系统文献综述。得出的分类学用作对话式流程建模的应用场景的识别，包括流程描述的释义和改进。应用场景基于高等教育领域的实际测试集对现有聊天机器人进行评估。该测试集包含流程描述及其对应的流程模型，以及模型质量的评估。基于文献和应用场景分析，得出了关于在对话式流程建模中使用聊天机器人的建议。",
