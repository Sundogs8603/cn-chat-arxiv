    "abstract": "In this work we theoretically show that conservative objective models (COMs) for offline model-based optimisation (MBO) are a special kind of contrastive divergence-based energy model, one where the energy function represents both the unconditional probability of the input and the conditional probability of the reward variable. While the initial formulation only samples modes from its learned distribution, we propose a simple fix that replaces its gradient ascent sampler with a Langevin MCMC sampler. This gives rise to a special probabilistic model where the probability of sampling an input is proportional to its predicted reward. Lastly, we show that better samples can be obtained if the model is decoupled so that the unconditional and conditional probabilities are modelled separately.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文理论上证明了保守的客观模型（COMs）用于离线基于模型的优化（MBO）是一种特殊的基于对比散度能量模型，其中能量函数既表示输入的无条件概率，也表示奖励变量的条件概率。虽然最初的公式只从其学习分布中抽样模型，但我们提出了一个简单的修复方法，用Langevin MCMC采样器替换梯度上升采样器。这产生了一种特殊的概率模型，其中采样输入的概率与其预测的奖励成比例。最后，我们证明，如果将模型分解，使无条件概率和条件概率分别建模，可以获得更好的样本。",
