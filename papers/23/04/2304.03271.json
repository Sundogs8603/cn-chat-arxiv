    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）模型的碳足迹不断增长，特别是像GPT-3和GPT-4这样的大型模型，已经受到公众的关注。然而，同等重要且巨大的AI模型水印尚未引起人们的注意。例如，在微软最先进的美国数据中心中训练GPT-3可以直接消耗70万升清洁淡水（相当于生产370辆宝马汽车或320辆特斯拉电动汽车），如果在微软的亚洲数据中心进行训练，这个水消耗量将增加三倍，但这样的信息一直被保密。这极其令人担忧，因为淡水短缺已成为在人口迅速增长、水资源减少和老化的水基础设施的背景下，我们所有人面临的最紧迫的挑战之一。为了应对全球水资源的挑战，人工智能模型可以，而且应该，承担社会责任，以身作则解决自己的问题。",
    "tldr": "本论文揭示以及提出了解决人工智能模型巨大水足迹的方法，因为其淡水消耗已经引起国际社会的重视，并且AI模型应该承担社会责任，做出面对水危机的表率。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper uncovers and proposes solutions to the enormous water footprint of AI models, which has become an internationally recognized issue due to freshwater scarcity. It also emphasizes that AI models should take social responsibility and set an example in response to the water crisis."
