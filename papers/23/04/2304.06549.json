    "translated_abstract": "最近，计算最优传输（OT）作为一个在各个领域应用的强有力的框架出现了。本文着重讨论对原始OT问题的一种放松形式，即熵OT问题，它可以实现高效的实际算法解决方案，即使在高维情况下也是如此。这个公式也被称为Schr\\\"odinger桥问题，显然与随机最优控制（SOC）相关，并且可以用流行的Sinkhorn算法来解决。对于离散状态空间的情况，已知该算法具有指数收敛性；然而，在更一般的情况下实现类似的收敛速率仍然是一个积极的研究领域。在本文中，我们分析了在$d$维环面$\\mathbb{T}_L^d$上定义的在Haar测度相对于密度可允许的概率度量的Sinkhorn算法的收敛性。特别的，在选择一定范围内的熵参数时，我们证明了Sinkhorn迭代及其梯度的点常指数收敛性。我们的证明技术依赖于一种耦合方法，受到[C. E. Brubaker, M. Fathi和G. Peyré, NeurIPS 2020]的最新工作的启发。我们还推导了Sinkhorn算法的新收敛速率，从而导出了Sinkhorn迭代和耦合的非渐近误差界限，这些界限独立于环境维数$d$和离散元素代价矩阵的尺寸。",
