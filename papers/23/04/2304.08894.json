    "translated_abstract": "早期基于GNN的SBR模型的性能瓶颈是内部会话信息的限制。因此，一些基于GNN的SBR模型已经发展出引入额外的会话间信息以促进下一个项目预测的能力。然而，我们发现引入会话间信息可能会对这些模型造成干扰。可能的原因有两个。首先，会话间的依赖性在因素级别上没有区分。其次，通过相似性来衡量会话间权重是不够的。在本文中，我们提出了DEISI来解决这些问题。对于第一个问题，DEISI使用DRL技术帮助在因素级别上区分会话间依赖性的类型。对于第二个问题，DEISI引入稳定性作为衡量会话间依赖性权重的新度量，同时加上相似性。此外，CL用于提高模型的鲁棒性。在三个数据集上进行了大量实验，展示了DEISI优越的性能。",
