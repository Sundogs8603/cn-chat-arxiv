    "translated_abstract": "我们实现并评估了一个自动化的网络防御代理。该代理以安全警报作为输入，并使用强化学习学习执行预定义的防御措施的策略。防御策略是在旨在模拟网络攻击的环境中进行培训的。在模拟中，攻击代理尝试在环境中捕获目标，而防御代理则尝试通过启用防御措施来保护它们。环境使用基于 Meta Attack Language 语言的攻击图进行建模。我们假设防御措施具有停机成本，这意味着防御代理使用它们时会受到惩罚。我们还假设该环境配备了一个不完美的入侵检测系统，该系统偶尔会根据环境状态产生错误的警报。为了评估这个设置，我们训练了不同量的入侵检测系统噪声的防御代理。我们还训练了具有不同攻击策略和影响的代理。",
