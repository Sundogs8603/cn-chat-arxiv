    "translated_abstract": "知识蒸馏是一种将大型神经网络压缩为更高效小型网络的强大技术。Softmax回归表征学习是一种常用的方法，它使用预先训练的教师网络来指导更小的学生网络的学习。尽管有几项研究探讨了Softmax回归表征学习的有效性，但提供知识转移的基础机制尚不够清楚。本文提出了理想联合分类器知识蒸馏（IJCKD），这是一个统一的框架，旨在为现有的知识蒸馏方法提供清晰全面的理解和为未来研究提供理论基础。我们使用从领域适应理论推导出的数学技术，提供了学生网络误差界的详细分析，其作为教师的函数关系。我们的框架可以在深度学习中应用于各种应用，包括图像识别和自然语言处理。",
