    "translated_abstract": "美国公立学校近期引入了预测算法（EWS）来提高毕业率。这些系统通过预测哪些学生可能退学，帮助对个体学生进行干预。虽然投资巨大，得到广泛应用，但对EWS有效性的理解仍然存在重大差距。本研究利用威斯康星全区的近十年数据，首次对EWS对毕业率的长期影响进行大规模评估。我们提供证据表明预测系统所做的风险评估非常准确，特别是对于来自边缘化背景的学生。尽管该系统准确性高并且得到广泛应用，但我们发现没有证据表明它会导致毕业率的提高。我们提供了一个强大的统计模式，可以解释为什么这些看似矛盾的见解存在，即环境因素，例如学生所在学校或社区的质量，淹没了EWS对毕业率可能产生的任何影响。",
    "tldr": "美国公立学校引入的预测算法（EWS）未能提高毕业率，EWS准确性高，但环境因素影响更大。",
    "en_tdlr": "Prediction algorithms (EWS) adopted by US public schools to improve graduation rates have shown high accuracy in identifying at-risk students, but a large-scale evaluation in Wisconsin found no evidence that EWS led to improved graduation rates, attributing this to environmental factors outweighing any potential impact."
