    "abstract": "Modeling the mechanics of fluid in complex scenes is vital to applications in design, graphics, and robotics. Learning-based methods provide fast and differentiable fluid simulators, however most prior work is unable to accurately model how fluids interact with genuinely novel surfaces not seen during training. We introduce SURFSUP, a framework that represents objects implicitly using signed distance functions (SDFs), rather than an explicit representation of meshes or particles. This continuous representation of geometry enables more accurate simulation of fluid-object interactions over long time periods while simultaneously making computation more efficient. Moreover, SURFSUP trained on simple shape primitives generalizes considerably out-of-distribution, even to complex real-world scenes and objects. Finally, we show we can invert our model to design simple objects to manipulate fluid flow.",

    "translated_abstract": "在设计、图形和机器人领域，模拟复杂场景中流体的力学是至关重要的。基于学习的方法提供了快速和可微的流体模拟器，但是先前的大部分工作不能精确地模拟流体如何与在训练中未见过的新颖表面相互作用。我们引入了SURFSUP，这是一个使用有符号距离函数（SDF）隐式表示对象的框架，而不是显式表示网格或粒子。几何体的这种连续表示使得在长时间段内更准确地模拟流体对象相互作用成为可能，同时使计算更加高效。此外，SURFSUP在简单的形状基元上训练，能够广泛地适用于分布之外，甚至适用于复杂的真实场景和对象。最后，我们展示了我们可以反演我们的模型来设计简单的物体来操纵流体流动。",

    "en_tdlr": "SURFSUP uses signed distance functions to represent objects, providing a more accurate and efficient learning method for fluid-object interactions. It can be applied to complex real-world scenes and objects beyond the training distribution, and can be inverted for object-manipulated fluid flow."
