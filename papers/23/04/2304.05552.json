    "translated_abstract": "动态神经网络是深度学习中的新兴研究课题。通过自适应推理，动态模型能够实现卓越的准确性和计算效率。然而，设计一个强大的动态检测器是具有挑战性的，因为缺乏适合目标检测任务的动态架构和退出准则。为解决这些难题，我们提出了一种名为DynamicDet的物体检测动态框架。首先，我们根据目标检测任务的性质精心设计了一种动态架构。然后，我们提出了一种自适应路由器，用于分析多尺度信息并自动决定推理路径。我们还提出了一种基于检测损失的退出准则的新型优化策略，用于我们的动态检测器。最后，我们提出了一种可变速度推理策略，帮助只用一个动态检测器实现广泛的精度 - 速度权衡。在COCO基准测试上进行的大量实验证明了我们的方法的有效性。",

    "en_tdlr": "DynamicDet is a dynamic framework proposed for object detection, featuring a carefully designed dynamic architecture, an adaptive router, a novel optimization strategy with an exiting criterion based on detection losses, and a variable-speed inference strategy. With these strategies, the framework can achieve a balance between accuracy and speed at different levels. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method."
