We conduct two studies; in the first study (n = 39) participants try creating a target Deepfake in a constrained time frame using any tool they desire. In the second study (n = 29) participants use pre-specified deep learning-based tools to create the same Deepfake.

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习和计算机视觉的最新进展已经导致了Deepfakes的泛滥。随着技术的民主化，越来越担心新手用户可以创建Deepfakes，以打击他人并破坏公共话语。本文通过用户研究来了解具有先进计算机技能和不同计算机科学专业水平的参与者是否可以使用有限的媒体文件创建Deepfakes。我们进行了两项研究，在第一项研究中（n = 39），参与者尝试在约束时间内使用任何工具创建目标Deepfake。在第二项研究中（n = 29），参与者使用预先指定的基于深度学习的工具来创建相同的Deepfake。我们发现，在第一项研究中，23.1%的参与者成功地创建了具有音频和视频的完整Deepfakes，而在第二项用户研究中，58.6%的参与者成功地将目标演讲缝合到源视频中。我们的发现表明，虽然对于新手用户而言创建Deepfakes可能并不容易，但也不是完全困难，因此需要研究界和政策制定者的关注。",
