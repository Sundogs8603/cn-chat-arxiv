    "translated_abstract": "深度学习和符号学习是序列推荐（SR）中经常使用的两种方法。最近的神经-符号SR模型展示了它们使SR具备并发感知和认知能力的潜力。然而，神经-符号SR仍然存在问题，如在逻辑推理中表示用户和物品。在本文中，我们将Deep Neural Network（DNN）SR模型与逻辑推理相结合，提出了一个通用框架，称为带有概率逻辑推理的序列推荐（简称SR-PLR）。该框架通过在DNN和概率逻辑网络中解开特征嵌入和逻辑嵌入，允许SR-PLR从相似性匹配和逻辑推理中受益。为了更好地捕捉用户口味的不确定性和演变，SR-PLR使用概率方法嵌入用户和物品，并对用户的交互模式进行概率逻辑推理。",
