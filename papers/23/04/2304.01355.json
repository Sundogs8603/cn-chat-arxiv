    "abstract": "Objective. Research on brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is advancing towards rehabilitating severely disabled patients in the real world. Two key factors for successful decoding of user intentions are the size of implanted microelectrode arrays and a good online spike sorting algorithm. A small but dense microelectrode array with 3072 channels was recently developed for decoding user intentions. The process of spike sorting determines the spike activity (SA) of different sources (neurons) from recorded neural data. Unfortunately, current spike sorting algorithms are unable to handle the massively increasing amount of data from dense microelectrode arrays, making spike sorting a fragile component of the online BCI decoding framework.

    "en_tdlr": "Ada-SpikeDeep-Classifier is an adaptive and self-organized algorithm for online spike sorting in brain-computer interfaces. It uses SpikeDeeptector for channel selection, Ada-BAR for signal preprocessing, and self-supervised Online Clustering Module (OCM) for classification. It showed high accuracy and robustness in spike sorting, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. This technique is a promising approach for improving decoding of user intentions and can be extended to other neural data analysis tasks in both neuroscience and machine learning communities."
