    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于区块链和Intel Software Guard Extension（SGX）可信执行环境（TEE）的联邦学习（FL）框架，在工业物联网（IIoTs）中安全地聚合本地模型。在FL中，攻击者可能篡改本地模型，因此，从篡改的本地模型生成的全局模型可能是错误的。因此，该框架利用区块链网络进行安全模型聚合，每个区块链节点都拥有一个启用了SGX的处理器，可以安全地执行基于FL的聚合任务以生成全局模型，节点可以验证聚合模型的真实性，运行区块链共识机制以确保模型的完整性，并将其添加到分布式分类帐中进行防篡改存储。每个集群都可以从区块链获取聚合模型并在使用之前验证其完整性。我们使用不同的CNN模型和数据集进行了几项实验，以评估该框架的性能。",
