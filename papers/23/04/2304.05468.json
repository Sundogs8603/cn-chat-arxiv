    "abstract": "The Serbian language is a Slavic language spoken by over 12 million speakers and well understood by over 15 million people. In the area of natural language processing, it can be considered a low-resourced language. Also, Serbian is considered a high-inflectional language. The combination of many word inflections and low availability of language resources makes natural language processing of Serbian challenging. Nevertheless, over the past three decades, there have been a number of initiatives to develop resources and methods for natural language processing of Serbian, ranging from developing a corpus of free text from books and the internet, annotated corpora for classification and named entity recognition tasks to various methods and models performing these tasks. In this paper, we review the initiatives, resources, methods, and their availability.",

    "translated_abstract": "塞尔维亚语是一种斯拉夫语言，拥有超过1200万的说话者，并被超过1500万人了解。在自然语言处理领域，它可被视作一种低资源语言，并且是一种高屈折语言。许多单词的屈折形式和语言资源的稀缺性结合在一起，使得塞尔维亚语的自然语言处理具有挑战性。尽管如此，在过去的三十年中，有许多倡议开展了塞尔维亚语自然语言处理的资源和方法的开发，从书籍和互联网的免费文本语料库、分类和命名实体识别任务的注释语料库到各种执行这些任务的方法和模型。在本文中，我们回顾了这些倡议、资源、方法及其可用性。",
