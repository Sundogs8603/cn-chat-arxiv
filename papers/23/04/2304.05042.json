    "translated_abstract": "在通信系统中，自编码器（AE）是指利用人工神经网络（ANN）替换收发器中的部分组件，通过信道模型对整个系统进行端对端训练。该方法旨在提高通信性能，特别是针对不同的信道条件，但训练和推理过程的计算复杂度较高。可编程门阵列（FPGAs）已被证明是适用于节能的ANN实现平台。然而，由于ANN中的操作数量和模型规模巨大，因此限制了在资源受限设备上的性能，这对于低延迟和高吞吐量的通信系统至关重要。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种新的方法，在FPGA上使用高效率的传统信号解析算法与具有适应性的AE相结合。在适应信道条件并调整后，ANN会隐式学习到信道特征。",
