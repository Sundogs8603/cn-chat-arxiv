    "translated_abstract": "自动化的感知图像质量评估是一个具有挑战性的问题，每天影响着数十亿互联网和社交媒体用户。为了推进这一领域的研究，我们提出了一种混合专家方法，训练两个独立的编码器在无监督的环境下学习高层次的内容和低层次的图像质量特征。我们方法的独特之处在于它能够生成与表示图像内容的高级特征互补的图像质量的低级表示。我们称用于训练这两个编码器的框架为 Re-IQA。为了在野外评估图像质量，我们利用从 Re-IQA 框架获得的互补的低和高级图像表示来训练线性回归模型，该模型将图像表示映射到质量得分，具体细节见图1。我们的方法在包含真实和合成图像的多个大型图像质量评估数据库上取得了最先进的性能。",
