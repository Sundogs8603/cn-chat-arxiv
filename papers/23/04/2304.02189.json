An iterative k-means clustering algorithm is applied to features derived through a split-apply-combine paradigm used in the database literature. Outliers are identified as singleton or small clusters. This algorithm is swept across the dataset in a searchlight manner. The dimensions that contain outliers are combined in pairs with other dimensions using a susbset scan technique to gain further insight into the outliers.

    "translated_abstract": "大规模和不断变化的数据集的交互式探索是具有挑战性的，因为底层变量之间的关系可能尚未被完全理解。数据中可能存在值得进一步探索和分析的隐藏趋势和模式。我们提出了一种系统，使用搜索光标技术系统地探索多种变量组合并识别异常值。在数据库文献中使用的分割-应用-组合范式中，应用了迭代的k-means聚类算法来生成特征。异常值被识别为单个值或小簇。这个算法以搜索光标的方式扫过数据集。利用子集扫描技术，将包含异常值的维度与其他维度成对组合，以进一步了解异常值。我们通过分析纽约州发布的开放卫生保健数据来说明这个系统。我们使用迭代的k-means搜索光标后跟子集扫描。可以识别出几个异常趋势，例如识别出一些医院的绩效始终低于同行，并准确地指出具体的临床状况与高于预期的发病率和死亡率有关。",

It can be applied to open health data analysis and can identify hospitals with consistently lower performance, as well as specific clinical conditions associated with higher than expected morbidity and mortality rates."
