    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic led to an infodemic where an overwhelming amount of COVID-19 related content was being disseminated at high velocity through social media. This made it challenging for citizens to differentiate between accurate and inaccurate information about COVID-19. This motivated us to carry out a comparative study of the characteristics of COVID-19 misinformation versus those of accurate COVID-19 information through a large-scale computational analysis of over 242 million tweets. The study makes comparisons alongside four key aspects: 1) the distribution of topics, 2) the live status of tweets, 3) language analysis and 4) the spreading power over time. An added contribution of this study is the creation of a COVID-19 misinformation classification dataset. Finally, we demonstrate that this new dataset helps improve misinformation classification by more than 9% based on average F1 measure.",

    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19疫情导致信息泛滥，大量与COVID-19相关的内容被通过社交媒体高速传播，这让公众难以区分COVID-19的准确和错误信息。为此，本文通过对超过2.42亿条推特进行大规模计算分析，对COVID-19错误和准确信息的特征进行了比较研究。研究涵盖四个方面: 1)主题的分布，2)推特的实时性，3)语言分析和4)时间上的传播能力。本文还创造了一个新的COVID-19错误信息分类数据集，最后演示了该数据集能够通过平均F1指标将错误信息分类提高9%以上。",
    "tldr": "本文通过大规模比较研究表明，COVID-19错误信息的分布、传播能力、语言分析与准确信息不同，并且研制了一个新的分类数据集，该数据集平均提高了9%以上的错误信息分类能力。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a large-scale comparative study that shows the differences between COVID-19 misinformation and accurate information in terms of their distribution, spreading power, language analysis, and real-time status. The paper also creates a new dataset for COVID-19 misinformation classification, which improves the classification accuracy by more than 9% based on the average F1 measure."
