    "translated_abstract": "加密挖矿是未经许可使用目标设备进行隐秘挖掘加密货币的行为。攻击者使用恶意JavaScript代码强制浏览器解决工作量证明问题，从而利用网站访客的资源赚钱。为了理解和对抗这样的攻击，我们系统地分析了浏览器中加密挖掘的静态、动态和经济方面。对于静态分析，我们对加密挖掘样本进行内容、货币和基于代码的分类，以1）测量它们在网站上的分布，2）突出它们的平台亲和性，以及3）研究它们的代码复杂性。我们采用机器学习技术将加密挖掘脚本与良性和恶意JavaScript样本区分开来，准确率达到100％。对于动态分析，我们分析了加密挖掘对关键系统资源（如CPU和电池使用）的影响。我们还执行Web浏览器指纹识别以分析信息交换。",
