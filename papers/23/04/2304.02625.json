    "abstract": "We highlight the challenges faced by non-native speakers when using AI writing assistants to paraphrase text. Through an interview study with 15 non-native English speakers (NNESs) with varying levels of English proficiency, we observe that they face difficulties in assessing paraphrased texts generated by AI writing assistants, largely due to the lack of explanations accompanying the suggested paraphrases. Furthermore, we examine their strategies to assess AI-generated texts in the absence of such explanations. Drawing on the needs of NNESs identified in our interview, we propose four potential user interfaces to enhance the writing experience of NNESs using AI writing assistants. The proposed designs focus on incorporating explanations to better support NNESs in understanding and evaluating the AI-generated paraphrasing suggestions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究通过对15名英语非母语者的访谈，探讨了非母语者使用AI写作助手进行转译时面临的挑战。研究发现，由于AI写作助手生成的建议转译缺乏解释，这些用户在评估转译文本时遇到困难。此外，本研究还调查了这些用户在缺少解释的情况下评估AI生成文本的策略。基于访谈中发现的非母语用户需求，本研究提出了四种潜在的用户界面设计，旨在通过增加解释来改善非母语用户使用AI写作助手的写作体验。",
