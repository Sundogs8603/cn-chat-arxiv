    "abstract": "A fundemantal and unanswered question for the widely shared goal of electrifying passenger vehicles is how the price of electricity, which can vary greatly across countries and regions, affects buying behavior. I make use of a natural experiment in Norway in the period 2021-2022 when large price differences between north and south emerged to estimate the effect of electricity prices on the decision to purchase a pure battery-electric vehicle. Simple difference estimates along the border of the price zones as well as a difference-in-difference regression model suggest a significant but economically modest effect of a 2-4\\% reduction in the probability of purchasing an electric vehicle in the high price zone. A counterfactual simulation suggests that there would have been about 3000 to 6000 fewer electric vehicles sold in the high-price south compared to a scenario where the south had equally low prices as in the north.",

    "translated_abstract": "实现电气化乘用车的共同目标中，一个基本和未回答的问题是电力价格如何影响购买行为，而电力价格在不同国家和地区可能会有很大的差异。本文利用了挪威在2021-2022年时出现的南北价格巨大差异的自然实验，估计了电力价格对购买纯电池电动汽车决策的影响。沿价格区域边界的差异估计以及差异-差异回归模型表明，在高价格区域，购买电动汽车的概率有显着但经济上适度的下降，约为2-4％。一项对事实的模拟表明，在南部价格等于北部的情况下，高价格区域将有大约3000到6000辆电动汽车销售量的减少。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper uses a natural experiment on north-south electricity price differences in Norway and shows that high electricity prices have a significant but modest negative effect on the decision to purchase a pure battery-electric vehicle, with an estimated reduction of 2-4% in the probability of buying such vehicles in the high-price zone. The counterfactual simulation suggests that there would have been 3000-6000 fewer EVs sold in the high-price south compared to a scenario with equally low prices as in the north."
