    "translated_abstract": "随着时间的推移，开源软件系统已经成为威胁行为者的猎物。尽管开源社区快速采取措施修补漏洞，但代码漏洞筛选应该成为敏捷软件开发的一部分，以便从一开始就能够识别新漏洞或向开发人员提供漏洞和分类。然而，当前的漏洞筛选技术对于识别新漏洞或为开发人员提供代码漏洞和分类方面的效果不佳。此外，用于漏洞学习的数据集由于攻击者部署的新攻击策略而展示出与实际测试分布的差异，导致机器学习模型的性能可能会受到阻碍或偏倚。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个联合插值多任务无偏漏洞分类器，包括Transformer \"RoBERTa\"和图卷积神经网络（GCN）。我们提出了一个训练过程，利用从源代码中得到的语义漏洞图（SVG）表示，该表示是由代码结构和函数创建的。我们的方法在公开数据集上实现了最先进的性能，解决了性能偏差的问题，并提高了识别新漏洞的准确性。",
