    "abstract": "In the automotive industry, the full cycle of managing in-use vehicle quality issues can take weeks to investigate. The process involves isolating root causes, defining and implementing appropriate treatments, and refining treatments if needed. The main pain-point is the lack of a systematic method to identify causal relationships, evaluate treatment effectiveness, and direct the next actionable treatment if the current treatment was deemed ineffective. This paper will show how we leverage causal Machine Learning (ML) to speed up such processes. A real-word data set collected from on-road vehicles will be used to demonstrate the proposed framework. Open challenges for vehicle quality applications will also be discussed.",

    "translated_abstract": "在汽车行业中，处理使用中车辆质量问题的全周期可能需要数周进行调查。这个过程涉及到隔离根本原因、定义和实施适当的治疗措施，以及在必要时改进治疗措施。主要问题是缺乏一种系统性的方法来确定因果关系、评估治疗效果，并在当前治疗被认为无效时指导下一个可行的治疗措施。本文将展示如何利用因果机器学习（ML）加速这些过程。使用从路上车辆收集的真实数据集来演示所提出的框架。还将讨论车辆质量应用的开放挑战。",
