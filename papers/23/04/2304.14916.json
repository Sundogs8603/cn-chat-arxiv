    "abstract": "The use of observed wearable sensor data (e.g., photoplethysmograms [PPG]) to infer health measures (e.g., glucose level or blood pressure) is a very active area of research.

A common approach is to collect sensor data and corresponding labels from a clinical grade device (e.g., blood pressure cuff), and train deep learning models to map one to the other.

We analyze the task of predicting blood pressure from PPG pulse wave analysis. Our review of the prior work reveals that many papers fall prey data leakage, and unrealistic constraints on the task and the preprocessing steps. We propose a set of tools to help determine if the input signal in question (e.g., PPG) is indeed a good predictor of the desired label",
