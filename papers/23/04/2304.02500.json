    "translated_abstract": "作为交通科学中最基本的概念之一, Wardrop 均衡一直缺乏相对较强的行为学支撑。为了加强这一基础，必须考虑人类决策过程中的有限理性，如缺乏准确信息、有限的计算能力和次优选择。然而，文献中的这种对行为完美主义的放弃通常伴随着WE的概念修改。在这里，我们展示了放弃完美理性不必导致WE的离开。相反，一种称为累积logit（CULO）的动态模型可以通过有限理性旅行者玩的路径游戏达到WE和全局稳定。我们通过开发一种称为每日（DTD）的动态模型达成了这个结果，该模型模拟旅客根据过去的经验逐渐调整其路径价值，从而得到了选择概率。我们的模型类似于经典的DTD模型，但发生了重大变化：经典模型中采取实数，而CULO模型使用积极的整数。",
