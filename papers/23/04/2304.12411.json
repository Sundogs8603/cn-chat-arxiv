    "abstract": "ChatGPT has gained both positive and negative publicity after reports suggesting that it is able to pass various professional and licensing examinations. This suggests that ChatGPT may pass Turing Test in the near future. However, a computer program that passing Turing Test can either mean that it is a Chinese Room or artificially conscious. Hence, the question of whether the current state of ChatGPT is more of a Chinese Room or approaching artificial consciousness remains. Here, I demonstrate that the current version of ChatGPT (Feb 13 version) is a Chinese Room. Despite potential evidence of cognitive connections, ChatGPT exhibits critical errors in causal reasoning. At the same time, I demonstrate that ChatGPT can generate all possible categorical responses to the same question and response with erroneous examples; thus, questioning its utility as a learning tool. I also show that ChatGPT is capable of artificial hallucination, which is defined as generating confidently wrong replie",

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT因能够通过各种专业和许可考试而引起了积极和消极的新闻报道。这表明ChatGPT可能在不久的将来通过图灵测试。然而，通过图灵测试的计算机程序既可以意味着它是一个中文房间，也可以意味着它是人工意识。因此，当前ChatGPT的状态更像是一个中文房间还是接近人工意识的问题仍存在。在这里，我证明了当前版本的ChatGPT（2月13日版本）是一个中文房间。尽管存在潜在的认知联系的证据，ChatGPT在因果推理方面存在严重错误。同时，我证明ChatGPT能够生成对同一问题的所有可能分类响应，并回复带有错误示例，因此质疑它作为学习工具的效用。我还展示了ChatGPT可以进行人工幻觉，这被定义为生成自信错误的回复。",
