    "abstract": "We present a computationally-grounded word similarity dataset based on two well-known Natural Language Processing resources; text corpora and knowledge bases. This dataset aims to fulfil a gap in psycholinguistic research by providing a variety of quantifications of semantic similarity in an extensive set of noun pairs controlled by variables that play a significant role in lexical processing. The dataset creation has consisted in three steps, 1) computing four key psycholinguistic features for each noun; concreteness, frequency, semantic and phonological neighbourhood density; 2) pairing nouns across these four variables; 3) for each noun pair, assigning three types of word similarity measurements, computed out of text, Wordnet and hybrid embeddings. The present dataset includes noun pairs' information in Basque and European Spanish, but further work intends to extend it to more languages.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们基于两个著名的自然语言处理资源：文本语料库和知识库，提出了一个基于计算的词语相似性数据集。该数据集旨在弥补心理语言学研究中的空白，通过提供大量控制了在词汇处理中起重要作用的变量的名词对的语义相似性的量化。数据集的创建包括三个步骤：1）为每个名词计算四个关键的心理语言学特征：具体性、频率、语义和音位邻近密度；2）在这些四个变量下对名词进行配对；3）对于每个名词对，分配三种类型的单词相似度测量，计算出文本、Wordnet和混合嵌入。目前的数据集包括巴斯克语和欧洲西班牙语的名词对信息，但进一步的工作意图将其扩展到更多语言。",
