    "translated_abstract": "解决顺序推荐的主流方法是使用固定向量来表示物品。这些向量在捕捉物品的潜在方面和用户的多样化偏好方面方面的能力有限。扩散模型作为一种新的生成范式，在计算机视觉和自然语言处理等领域取得了很好的性能。在我们看来，其在表征生成方面的独特优势很好地适应了顺序推荐的问题设置。本文首次尝试将扩散模型应用于顺序推荐，并提出了DiffuRec，用于物品表示构建和不确定性注入。与将物品表示建模为固定向量不同，我们在DiffuRec中将其表示为分布，这反映了用户的多重兴趣和物品的各个方面的适应性。在扩散阶段，DiffuRec通过添加噪声将目标物品嵌入成高斯分布，进一步应用于顺序物品分布表示。",
