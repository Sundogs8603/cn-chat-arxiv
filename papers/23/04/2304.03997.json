However, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources can make it challenging to manage the power grid and ensure a stable supply of electricity. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for predicting energy demand in a smart power grid, which can improve the integration of renewable energy sources by providing accurate predictions of energy demand. We use long short-term memory networks, which are well-suited for time series data, to capture complex patterns and dependencies in energy demand data. The proposed approach is evaluated using four datasets of historical energy demand data from different energy distribution companies including American Electric Power, Commonwealth Edison, Dayton Power and Light, and Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection.

    "translated_abstract": "随着世界向更可持续的能源未来发展，将可再生能源源纳入电网的集成变得越来越重要。然而，可再生能源的间歇性使电网管理和确保稳定的电力供应变得具有挑战性。本文提出了一种基于深度学习的方法来预测智能电网中的能量需求，可以通过提供准确的能量需求预测来改善可再生能源的集成。我们使用长短期记忆网络来捕捉能럟需求数据中的复杂模式和依赖关系，这些网络特别适用于时间序列数据。所提出的方法使用了四个历史能量需求数据集，这些数据集来自不同的能源分配公司，包括美国电力、Commonwealth Edison、Dayton Power and Light以及宾夕法尼亚-新泽西-马里兰互联网。该方法还将REDf模型与其他两个深度学习模型和基准模型进行比较。实验结果表明，我们提出的REDf模型在平均绝对误差、均方根误差和决定系数等准确度指标方面优于其他模型。因此，REDf可以作为可再生能源需求预测的可靠工具，并提高可再生能源纳入智能电网的能力。",
