    "abstract": "In this paper, we follow a data-centric philosophy and propose a novel motion annotation method based on the inherent representativeness of motion data in a given dataset. Specifically, we propose a Representation-based Representativeness Ranking R3 method that ranks all motion data in a given dataset according to their representativeness in a learned motion representation space. We further propose a novel dual-level motion constrastive learning method to learn the motion representation space in a more informative way. Thanks to its high efficiency, our method is particularly responsive to frequent requirements change and enables agile development of motion annotation models. Experimental results on the HDM05 dataset against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于数据中心哲学的新型动作注释方法，该方法基于给定数据集中动作数据的内在相关性。具体而言，我们提出了一种称为表征相关性排名R3的方法，该方法根据动作在学习的动作表示空间中的表征性对其在给定数据集中进行排名。我们进一步提出了一种新颖的双级动作对比学习方法来以更加信息化的方式学习动作表示空间。由于其高效性，我们的方法能够更快地应对频繁的需求变化，并实现动作注释模型的敏捷开发。对HDM05数据集的实验结果表明，我们的方法优于现有的方法。",
