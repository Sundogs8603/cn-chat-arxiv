    "translated_abstract": "由于所学嵌入的紧凑性和丰富性以及未标记图数据的丰富性，无监督学习的图表示在(大型)图上已经受到研究界的重视。当这些节点表示被部署时，必须使用适当的公平性约束条件生成以减少它们对下游任务造成的偏差。因此，对于特定的下游任务，已经调查了图学习算法的群体和个体公平性概念。这些公平性概念的主要局限性是没有考虑连接模式在图中导致的不同节点影响(或中心性能量)。在本文中，我们为归纳图表示学习算法设计了一个基于中心性的公平框架。我们提出了CAFIN（Centrality Aware Fairness inducing IN-processing），一种利用图结构改进GraphSAGE表示的进程技术——无监督图学习文献中的一种流行框架。对真实世界数据集的广泛实验表明，CAFIN在提供具有竞争力或更好的下游任务性能的同时，实现了最先进的公平结果。",
