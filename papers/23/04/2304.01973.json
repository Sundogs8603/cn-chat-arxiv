    "translated_abstract": "多源域通用性（DG）衡量分类器对于它没有接受过训练的新数据分布的泛化能力，并考虑了多个训练域。虽然已经提出了几种多源DG方法，但是它们在训练过程中使用域标签增加了额外的复杂性。最近的研究表明，经过良好调整的经验风险最小化（ERM）训练过程，即在源域上简单地最小化经验风险，可以胜过大多数现有的DG方法。我们确定了几个关键候选技术，以进一步提高ERM的性能，例如更好地利用训练数据、模型参数选择和权重空间正则化。我们将结果称为ERM ++，并展示它相对于标准ERM在五个多源数据集上将DG的性能显着提高了5％以上，并且尽管计算复杂度更低，但击败了最先进的方法。此外，我们还证明了ERM ++在WILDS-FMOW数据集上的有效性。",
