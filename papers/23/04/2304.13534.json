    "translated_abstract": "本文展示了均场博弈 (MFGs) 作为一种数学框架用于解释、增强和设计生成模型的多功能性。我们建立了 MFGs 与主要流动和扩散型生成模型之间关联，并通过不同的粒子动力学和代价函数推导了这三个类别的生成模型。此外，我们通过研究它们相关的 MFG 的最优条件——一组耦合的非线性偏微分方程，来研究每个生成模型的数学结构和特性。本文还提出了一个新的基于双人 MFG 的生成模型，其中一个代理合成样本，另一个代理对样本进行识别，理论和实验结果表明，该模型生成的样本多样且逼真，同时与基准模型相比，改善了解缠结和公平性。总之，本文突显了 MFGs 作为设计和分析生成模型的实验室的潜力。",

The connections between MFGs and major classes of flow and diffusion-based generative models are established, and a new generative model based on a two-player MFG is proposed. The MFGs' optimality conditions are studied to analyze the mathematical structure and properties of each generative model. Results suggest that this model can generate diverse and realistic samples while improving disentanglement and fairness compared to baseline models."
