    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络（DNN）分区是一个研究问题，涉及将DNN拆分为多个部分并将它们卸载到特定位置。由于多接入边缘计算和边缘智能的最新进展，当边缘和终端设备的计算资源有限且从这些设备到云的远程传输数据代价高昂时，DNN分区被认为是提高DNN推理性能的有力工具。本文通过对相关文献的详细文献收集，提供了对云、边缘和端设备上DNN分区方法的最新进展和挑战的全面综述。我们回顾了DNN分区在各种应用场景中的工作方式，并提供了DNN分区问题的统一数学模型。我们开发了一个DNN分区方法的五维分类框架，包括部署位置、分区粒度、分区约束、优化目标和通信协议。最后，我们讨论了DNN分区和其与云和边缘计算的集成面临的挑战和未来研究方向。",
