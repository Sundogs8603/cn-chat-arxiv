    "translated_abstract": "光学显微镜图像通过直接可视化纳米世界，在科学研究中扮演着重要角色。成像机制被描述为点扩散函数（PSF）和发射源的卷积，可以基于PSF或等价PSF的先验知识，实现对纳米世界的更精确探测。然而，直接从显微镜图像中提取PSF仍然是一个重大挑战。在这里，我们提出了一种物理感知的掩蔽自编码器（PiMAE），通过自我监督的学习，可以直接从原始显微镜图像中学习估计PSF和发射源。我们在合成数据和真实世界实验中展示了我们的方法，具有显著的准确性和噪声鲁棒性。在合成数据任务中，PiMAE优于DeepSTORM和Richardson-Lucy算法，平均改进分别为19.6％和50.7％（35个任务），使用归一化均方根误差（NRMSE）m来衡量。",
