    "abstract": "The importance of predicting stock market prices cannot be overstated. It is a pivotal task for investors and financial institutions as it enables them to make informed investment decisions, manage risks, and ensure the stability of the financial system. Accurate stock market predictions can help investors maximize their returns and minimize their losses, while financial institutions can use this information to develop effective risk management policies. However, stock market prediction is a challenging task due to the complex nature of the stock market and the multitude of factors that can affect stock prices. As a result, advanced technologies such as deep learning are being increasingly utilized to analyze vast amounts of data and provide valuable insights into the behavior of the stock market. While deep learning has shown promise in accurately predicting stock prices, there is still much research to be done in this area.",
