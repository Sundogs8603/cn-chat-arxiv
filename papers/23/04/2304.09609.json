    "translated_abstract": "近年来，物体检测在自主系统中得到了广泛应用，包括2D和3D物体检测。该领域的最新研究主要集中在多模态方法上。本文提出了一种基于结果特征级融合的多模态融合方法。该方法利用从单模态源产生的结果特征，并将它们融合用于下游任务。基于此方法，提出了一种新的后融合网络，用于多模态物体检测，利用单模态结果作为特征。提出的方法称为基于结果特征的多模态检测器(MMDR)，旨在应用于2D和3D物体检测任务。与以往的多模态模型相比，本文提出的方法在较晚的阶段执行特征融合，有助于更好地表示单模态源的深层特征。此外，MMDR模型结合了单模态源的浅层和深层特征，从而进一步提高了检测精度。",
