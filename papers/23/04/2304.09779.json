    "abstract": "Group fairness is achieved by equalising prediction distributions between protected sub-populations; individual fairness requires treating similar individuals alike. These two objectives, however, are incompatible when a scoring model is calibrated through discontinuous probability functions, where individuals can be randomly assigned an outcome determined by a fixed probability. This procedure may provide two similar individuals from the same protected group with classification odds that are disparately different -- a clear violation of individual fairness. Assigning unique odds to each protected sub-population may also prevent members of one sub-population from ever receiving equal chances of a positive outcome to another, which we argue is another type of unfairness called individual odds. We reconcile all this by constructing continuous probability functions between group thresholds that are constrained by their Lipschitz constant. Our solution preserves the model's predictive powe",

    "translated_abstract": "组公平通过平衡受保护子群体之间的预测分布来实现；个人公平要求将相似的个体视为同等对待。然而，当评分模型通过不连续的概率函数进行校准时，这两个目标是不兼容的，其中个体可能会随机分配由固定概率确定的结果。这个过程可能会使来自同一受保护组的两个相似个体的分类几率差别明显不同，这是个人公平的明显违反。为每个受保护子群体分配唯一的几率也可能会阻止一个子群体的成员接到另一个子群体有正面结果的平等机会，我们认为这是另一种称为个人几率的不公平类型。我们通过构建受群体阈值约束的连续概率函数来解决所有这些问题。我们的解决方案保留了模型的预测能力。",
