    "translated_abstract": "整合基于物理和基于数据的方法已经成为建模可持续能源系统的常见方法。但是，现有的文献主要集中在生成用于替代基于物理模型的数据驱动替代模型上。这些模型通常以速度为代价换取精度，但缺乏基于物理模型的泛化性、适应性和可解释性，而这些特点在优化和控制实际动态系统的建模中通常是不可或缺的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的体系结构来生成模型集成神经网络（MINN），以允许在学习系统物理动态方面进行整合。获得的混合模型解决了控制导向建模中一个尚未解决的研究问题，即如何同时获得物理洞察力、数字精度和计算可行性的最优简化模型。我们将所提出的神经网络架构应用于锂离子电池的电化学动力学建模，并展示了所提出的模型在解释性、精度和计算效率方面的优势。",
