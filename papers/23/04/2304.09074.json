    "translated_abstract": "电阻抗层析成像(EIT)是一种利用在对象表面上测量的电流密度/电压数据的非侵入式医学成像方式。Calderon的方法是一种相对较新的EIT成像算法，它是非迭代的、快速的，并且能够重建复值电阻抗。然而，由于正则化通过低通滤波和线性化，重建的图像遭受严重的模糊和低估确切的电导率值。在这项工作中，我们开发了Calderón方法的增强版本，使用卷积神经网络（即U-net）通过后处理步骤。具体来说，我们学习一个U-net来后处理由Calderón方法生成的EIT图像，以获得更好的分辨率和更准确的电导率估计。我们模拟胸部配置，通过Calderón方法生成电流密度/电压边界测量和相应的重建图像。",
