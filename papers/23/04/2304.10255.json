    "abstract": "The recent rise in popularity of Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) for deep learning has highlighted the role that good hyperparameter (HP) space design can play in training strong models. In turn, designing a good HP space is critically dependent on understanding the role of different HPs. This motivates research on HP Importance (HPI), e.g., with the popular method of functional ANOVA (f-ANOVA). However, the original f-ANOVA formulation is inapplicable to the subspaces most relevant to algorithm designers, such as those defined by top performance. To overcome this problem, we derive a novel formulation of f-ANOVA for arbitrary subspaces and propose an algorithm that uses Pearson divergence (PED) to enable a closed-form computation of HPI. We demonstrate that this new algorithm, dubbed PED-ANOVA, is able to successfully identify important HPs in different subspaces while also being extremely computationally efficient.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习中超参数优化的流行使得好的超参数空间设计对于训练强模型至关重要，而好的超参数空间设计又严重依赖于了解不同超参数的作用。这激发了关于超参数重要性的研究，例如使用功能方差分析 (f-ANOVA) 的流行方法。然而，原始的 f-ANOVA 公式不适用于算法设计师最相关的子空间，例如由最佳性能定义的子空间。为了解决这个问题，我们推导了一个新的针对任意子空间的 f-ANOVA 公式，并提出了一个算法，使用 Pearson 散度 (PED) 实现超参数重要性的闭式计算。我们证明，这个新算法，称为 PED-ANOVA，能够成功地识别不同子空间中重要的超参数，同时计算效率极高。",
