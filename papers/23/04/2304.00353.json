The crucial task of assigning reviewers to submitted proposals is the starting point of the review process and is also known as the reviewer assignment problem (RAP).

    "translated_abstract": "适当的评审人分配显著影响评估的质量，因为准确和公正的审查取决于将其分配给相关的评审人。将评审人分配给提交的提案是审查过程的起点，也称为评审人分配问题（RAP）。由于手动分配的明显限制，期刊编辑、会议组织者和拨款经理要求自动评审人分配方法。自1992年以来，许多研究提出了分配解决方案以响应自动化程序的需求。本次调查报告的主要目标是为学者和实践者提供关于RAP领域中可用研究的全面概述。为实现这一目标，本文对过去三十年内发表在Web of Science、Scopus、ScienceDirect和Google Scholar等数据库中的103篇评审人分配领域的出版物进行了深入的系统综述。",
