    "translated_abstract": "即使是最尖端的人工通用智能(AGI)项目，人与机器之间的差异也十分明显。尽管这种差异本质上将每个人的能力划分开来，但人类级别的智能(HLI)已经是AGI几十年来的目标。本文反对图灵测试的二元论，即将其作为潜在智能机器的基础和原始建立的意图。它讨论了AI专家如何误解模仿游戏作为对计算机系统进行拟人化的手段，并断言HLI是一个转移注意力、使当前研究远离相关问题的错误方向。尽管对AGI应用的潜在设计进行了广泛研究，但却很少考虑这样一个系统如何以类似人类的水平访问和摄取数据。尽管当前的机器可能模拟特定的人类属性，但AGI是在这样的前提下开发出来的：这可以很容易地扩展到一般智能水平。",
