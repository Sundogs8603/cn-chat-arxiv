    "translated_abstract": "医学图像分割是一项具有固有模糊性和高度不确定性的挑战性任务，归因于模糊的肿瘤边界和多个可能的注释等因素。分割掩模的准确性和多样性对提供临床实践中放射学家的有价值参考均至关重要。然而，现有的扩散模型在各种视觉生成任务中显示了强大的能力，但处理分割中的离散掩模仍具有挑战性。为了实现准确且多样的医学图像分割掩模，我们提出了一种新颖的针对医学图像分割的条件伯努利扩散模型（BerDiff）。我们首先提出使用伯努利噪声作为扩散核来增强用于二进制分割任务的扩散模型的能力，从而得到更准确的分割掩模。其次，通过利用扩散模型的随机性质，我们的BerDiff在推理期间随机采样初始的伯努利噪声以生成多样的分割掩模。在BraTS和LiTS两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，我们提出的BerDiff在分割掩模的准确性和多样性方面胜过了几种最先进的方法。",

Experimental results show that BerDiff outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and diversity of segmentation masks."
