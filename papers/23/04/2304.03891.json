    "translated_abstract": "交叉领域序列推荐（CDSR）旨在基于多个领域中用户的历史序列互动来预测未来的互动。然而，CDSR的关键挑战在于如何基于序列内和序列间物品互动挖掘精确的跨领域用户偏好。现有方法首先仅利用序列内物品互动学习单领域用户偏好，然后构建传递模块以获取跨领域用户偏好。该方法存在一些瓶颈，并忽略了考虑序列间物品之间的关系。本文提出了C^2DSR来解决上述问题以捕捉精确的用户偏好。其主要思想是同时利用序列内和序列间物品关系，并共同学习单领域和跨领域用户偏好。具体来说，我们首先利用图神经网络挖掘跨领域物品关系，然后使用序列模型捕获单领域物品关系。结合所学的偏好，我们提出了一种新的对比交叉注意机制以获取跨领域偏好。在三个真实数据集上进行的实验结果表明了我们提出方法的有效性。",

It simultaneously leverages both types of interactions, jointly learns single- and cross-domain user preferences, and proposes a novel contrastive cross-attention mechanism to obtain cross-domain preference. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
