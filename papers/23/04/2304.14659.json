    "abstract": "Multi-objective AI planning suffers from a lack of benchmarks exhibiting known Pareto Fronts. In this work, we propose a tunable benchmark generator, together with a dedicated solver that provably computes the true Pareto front of the resulting instances. First, we prove a proposition allowing us to characterize the optimal plans for a constrained version of the problem, and then show how to reduce the general problem to the constrained one. Second, we provide a constructive way to find all the Pareto-optimal plans and discuss the complexity of the algorithm. We provide an implementation that allows the solver to handle realistic instances in a reasonable time. Finally, as a practical demonstration, we used this solver to find all Pareto-optimal plans between the two largest airports in the world, considering the routes between the 50 largest airports, spherical distances between airports and a made-up risk.",
