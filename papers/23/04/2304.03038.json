    "abstract": "Understanding customer lifetime value is key to nurturing long-term customer relationships, however, estimating it is far from straightforward. In the retail banking industry, commonly used approaches rely on simple heuristics and do not take advantage of the high predictive ability of modern machine learning techniques. We present a general framework for modelling customer lifetime value which may be applied to industries with long-lasting contractual and product-centric customer relationships, of which retail banking is an example. This framework is novel in facilitating CLV predictions over arbitrary time horizons and product-based propensity models. We also detail an implementation of this model which is currently in production at a large UK lender. In testing, we estimate an 43% improvement in out-of-time CLV prediction error relative to a popular baseline approach. Propensity models derived from our CLV model have been used to support customer contact marketing campaigns. In test",

    "translated_abstract": "理解客户生命周期价值是培养长期客户关系的关键，但估计它远非易事。在零售银行业中，常用的方法依赖于简单的启发式算法，并未充分利用现代机器学习技术的高预测能力。我们提出了一个通用的框架来建模客户生命周期价值，该框架可应用于具有长期合同和产品中心客户关系的行业，其中零售银行就是一个例子。该框架的创新之处在于可以在任意时间范围内进行CLV预测和基于产品的倾向模型。我们还详细介绍了这个模型的实现，该模型目前已在一家大型英国放贷机构中投入生产。在测试中，相对于一种流行的基线方法，我们估计在时间外CLV预测误差方面有43%的改善。从我们的CLV模型派生的倾向模型已被用于支持客户联络营销活动。",
