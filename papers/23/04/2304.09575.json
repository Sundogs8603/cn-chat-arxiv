    "translated_abstract": "模型预测控制(MPC)可以实现对于一般非线性系统的稳定性和约束条件的满足，但需要进行计算开销很大的在线优化。本文研究了通过神经网络(NNs)对这种MPC控制器的近似，以实现快速的在线评估。我们提出了安全增强，尽管存在近似不准确性，但可以获得收敛和约束条件的确定保证。我们使用NN近似MPC的整个输入序列，这使得我们在线验证它是否是MPC问题的可行解。当该解决方案不可行或成本更高时，我们基于标准MPC技术将NN解决方案替换为安全候选解。我们的方法仅需要对NN进行一次评估和对输入序列进行在线前向积分，这在资源受限系统上的计算速度很快。所提出的控制框架在三个不同复杂度的非线性MPC基准上进行了演示，展示了计算效率。",
