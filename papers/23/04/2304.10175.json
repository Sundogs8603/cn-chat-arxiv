RAUS leverages existing statistical methods (Cramers V, chi-squared test, and information gain) to compare variable ordering, resultant generated network topologies, and DBN performance. RAUS enables end-users with limited DBN expertise to implement models via command line interface. We evaluate RAUS on the task of predicting impending acute kidney injury (AKI) from inpatient clinical laboratory data.
