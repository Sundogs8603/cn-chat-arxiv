    "translated_abstract": "各行各业的操作员一直在推广无线传感器节点用于工业监控，这些努力产生了可用于构建诊断算法的大规模条件监测数据集，以警告维护工程师即将发生的故障或识别当前系统的健康状况。然而，单个操作员可能没有足够大的系统或部件数量来收集足够的数据以开发数据驱动的算法。收集安全关键系统的满意数量的故障模式特别困难，因为故障的稀有性。联邦学习 (FL) 已经成为一种有前途的解决方案，利用多个操作员的数据集来训练去中心化资产故障诊断模型，同时保持数据的机密性。然而，在优化联邦策略时仍有相当大的障碍需要克服，以避免泄漏敏感数据并解决由数据异质性引起的问题。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种基于不确定性客户聚类的联邦学习框架，用于车队故障诊断，通过完全去中心化的架构和客户聚类，提高了模型的精确性和效率，并在真实数据集上证明了其优于现有联邦学习方法的表现。"
