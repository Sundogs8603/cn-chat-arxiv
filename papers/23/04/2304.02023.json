    "translated_abstract": "因果概率在法律、医疗和公共政策中对决策起着基础性的作用。然而，其准确定位具有挑战性，需要一些强假设，比如单调性。在没有这样的假设的情况下，现有的工作需要包含相同处理和结果变量的数据集的多个观测，以便对这些概率进行边界约束。然而，在许多临床试验和公共政策评估中，存在独立的数据集，这些数据集检查了不同治疗方式对同一结果变量的影响。在这里，我们描述了如何通过强制独立数据集中构造的SCM（“因果边际问题”）的反事实一致性，从而大大缩小现有的因果概率范围。接下来，我们描述了一种新的信息理论方法，用于通过使用条件互信息量化反事实影响来证明因果概率的虚假性。",
