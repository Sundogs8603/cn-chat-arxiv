    "translated_abstract": "基于人工智能（AI）的模型可以帮助从肺部CT扫描和X射线图像中诊断COVID-19，但是这些模型需要大量的数据来进行训练和验证。许多研究人员研究了生成对抗网络（GAN）来产生合成的肺部CT扫描和X射线图像，以提高AI模型的性能。目前尚未探索如何使用GAN生成可靠的合成数据。本项研究分析了43篇发表的报告，报告了GAN用于合成数据生成。这些研究中许多存在数据偏见、缺乏可重复性以及缺乏来自放射学家或其他领域专家的反馈。这些研究的一个普遍问题是源代码不可用，这妨碍了可重复性。这些研究中还报告了将输入图像重新缩放以训练现有的GAN架构的方法，但没有提供如何缩放的临床见解。最后，虽然基于GAN的方法有望为诊断COVID-19的AI模型产生合成数据，但本项研究分析的研究具有有限的可重复性和临床相关性。",
