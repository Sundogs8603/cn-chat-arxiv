    "translated_abstract": "从高维数据中发现因果关系是生物信息学中的一个重大问题。机器学习和特征归因模型在这个领域显示出巨大的潜力，但缺乏因果解释。本文研究表明，一个常见的特征归因模型在某些假设下估计了反映一个变量对另一个变量影响的因果数量。我们利用这个见解实现了一个新工具CIMLA，用于发现条件依赖的因果关系变化，然后使用CIMLA识别生物条件下基因调控网络的差异。通过对模拟数据集进行广泛的基准测试，我们表明CIMLA比领先的方法更具鲁棒性和准确性。最后，我们运用CIMLA分析了一个先前发表的单细胞RNA-seq数据集，收集了带有和不带有阿尔茨海默病（AD）的患者数据，并发现了基因与AD之间的新潜在因果关系。",
