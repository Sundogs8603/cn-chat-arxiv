    "translated_abstract": "变分自编码器（VAE）被用于诸多领域的迁移学习，例如音乐生成和医学图像分析。但是，在迁移前，没有一种原则性的方法来评估哪些组件需要重新训练，或者迁移学习是否有可能在目标任务上起到帮助作用。本文通过表示相似性的视角来探讨这个问题，具体来说，我们使用中心核对齐方法（CKA）来评估在不同数据集上训练的VAE的相似性，并表明编码器的表示是通用的，而解码器的表示是特定的。基于这些认识，我们讨论了选择VAE哪些组件重新训练的影响，并提出了一种可视化评估迁移学习是否有可能在分类任务上有帮助的方法。",

The study finds that VAE's encoder representations are generic while the decoder representations are specific, which has implications for selecting which VAE components to retrain and for visually assessing the potential of transfer learning in classification tasks."
