    "translated_abstract": "基于张量的多视角子空间聚类方法已经取得了重要进展，能够评估高阶相关性并提高多视角数据的聚类分析。然而，现有研究大多数存在两个缺陷。首先，基于自表示的张量子空间学习通常引起高时间和空间复杂度，并且局限于感知嵌入空间中的非线性局部结构。其次，张量奇异值分解（t-SVD）模型将每个奇异值等分地重新分布，而无法考虑它们之间的不同重要性。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种低秩张量空间中的超拉普拉斯正则化概念因式分解（HLRCF）多视角聚类方法。具体地，我们将概念因式分解应用于探索每个视角的潜在聚类表示。进一步地，超图拉普拉斯正则化赋予了该模型提取非线性局部结构的能力。",
