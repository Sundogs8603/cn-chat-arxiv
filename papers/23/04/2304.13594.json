    "translated_abstract": "生存分析是一项重要的半监督任务，在机器学习中具有很多现实世界的应用，尤其是在医疗领域。目前，生存分析最常见的方法是基于Cox的部分似然，可解释为在一致性指数的下限上优化的排序模型。这种排序模型和Cox的部分似然之间的关系仅考虑了成对比较。最近的工作发展了可区分排序的方法，放松了这种成对独立假设，使得能够对样本集进行排序。然而，当前的可区分排序方法不能考虑到许多真实世界数据中的关键因素——审查。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一种新的方法Diffsurv。我们通过预测可能排列矩阵来扩展不同iable排序方法以处理审查任务，这些矩阵考虑到审查样本引入的标签不确定性。我们将这种方法与方法进行比较...",
