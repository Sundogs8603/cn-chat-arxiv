    "translated_abstract": "准确的医学图像分割对于精确和有效的医疗干预至关重要。然而，尽管卷积神经网络(CNN)在医学图像分割方面取得了成功，但它们仍面临着处理细粒度特征和图像尺度变化的挑战。这些挑战在复杂和具有挑战性的分割任务中特别明显，例如BraTS多标签脑肿瘤分割挑战赛中。在这个任务中，精确地分割不同的肿瘤亚组分，在大小和形状上都有显著变化，仍然是一个重大挑战，即使是最先进的方法也会产生重大错误。因此，我们提出了两种架构，FMG-Net和W-Net，它们将解线性方程组的几何多重网格方法的原理纳入CNN中，以解决这些挑战。我们在BraTS 2020数据集上的实验表明，FMG-Net和W-Net都优于广泛使用的U-Net架构，特别是在分割中的tum的精度方面。",
