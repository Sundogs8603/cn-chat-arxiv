    "translated_abstract": "计算机辅助自动分析糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）对减少视力丧失和失明的风险具有重要意义，但缺乏公开可用的模型开发和评估基准。超广角光学相干断层扫描血管造影（UW-OCTA）是DR诊断系统中一种非侵入性和安全的成像模式。为了促进进一步的研究和使用UW-OCTA图像进行糖尿病视网膜病变分析的科学基准制定，我们与第25届医学图像计算和计算机辅助干预国际会议（MICCAI 2022）联合组织了一个名为“DRAC-Diabetic Retinopathy Analysis Challenge”的挑战比赛。该挑战包括三个任务：DR损伤分割、图像质量评估和DR分级。科学界积极响应该挑战，并从地理上不同的机构提交了11个、12个和13个团队提供的这三个任务的不同解决方案。",
