    "translated_abstract": "近年来，图像级别的弱监督语义分割（WSSS）任务因为其可减少大量数据标注成本而变得流行。WSSS的典型方法是使用全局平均池化（GAP）在卷积特征映射上训练图像分类网络。这使得可以基于类别激活图（CAMs）估计对象位置，CAMs识别图像区域的重要性。然后使用CAMs生成伪标签，以形式化的分割掩码的方式在缺乏像素级标签的情况下对分割模型进行监督。在SEAM基线的情况下，一个先前的工作提出了提高CAM学习的两种方法：（1）重要性抽样，它是GAP的替代方法；（2）特征相似性损失，它使用一种启发式方法，即对象轮廓几乎仅与图像中的颜色边缘对齐。在这项工作中，我们为这些任务提出了一种不同的概率解释CAM的方法，从而生成更精确的伪标签。具体而言，我们采用马尔可夫随机场将局部空间一致性约束融入CAM学习中。我们还提出了一种新的训练策略，交替更新CAM和分割模型以实现更好的收敛。在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的方法在弱监督分割方法中实现了最先进的性能。",
