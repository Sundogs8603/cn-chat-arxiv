    "abstract": "The combined growth of available data and their unstructured nature has received increased interest in natural language processing (NLP) techniques to make value of these data assets since this format is not suitable for statistical analysis. This work presents a systematic literature review of state-of-the-art advances using transformer-based methods on electronic medical records (EMRs) in different NLP tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work is unique in providing a comprehensive review of research on transformer-based methods for NLP applied to the EMR field. In the initial query, 99 articles were selected from three public databases and filtered into 65 articles for detailed analysis. The papers were analyzed with respect to the business problem, NLP task, models and techniques, availability of datasets, reproducibility of modeling, language, and exchange format. The paper presents some limitations of current research and some recommendations for further research.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于可用数据的增长和它们的非结构化性质，越来越多的自然语言处理（NLP）技术开始受到关注，以从这些数据资产中获得价值，因为这种格式不适用于统计分析。本文对不同NLP任务中基于变压器的EMR上的最新进展进行了系统性的文献综述。在最初的查询中，从三个公共数据库中选择了99篇文章，最终筛选得到了65篇文章进行详细分析。本文将从业务问题、NLP任务、模型和技术、数据集的可用性、建模的可重复性、语言和交换格式等方面对这些论文进行分析。文章提出了当前研究的一些局限性以及进一步研究的建议。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文综述了基于Transformer的自然语言处理技术在电子病历领域中的应用，并提出了目前研究中的限制和未来研究的方向。",
