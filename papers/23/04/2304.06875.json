    "abstract": "As language models scale up, it becomes increasingly expensive to verify research ideas because conclusions on small models do not trivially transfer to large ones. A possible solution is to establish a generic system that directly predicts some metrics for large models solely based on the results and hyperparameters from small models. Existing methods based on scaling laws require hyperparameter search on the largest models, which is impractical with limited resources. We address this issue by presenting our discoveries indicating that Maximal Update parametrization (muP) enables accurate fitting of scaling laws for hyperparameters close to common loss basins, without any search. Thus, different models can be directly compared on large scales with loss prediction even before the training starts. We propose a new paradigm as a first step towards reliable academic research for any model scale without heavy computation. Code will be publicly available shortly.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着语言模型的扩大，验证研究想法变得越来越昂贵，因为小模型的结论不能简单地转移到大模型。解决方案是建立一个通用系统，仅基于小模型的结果和超参数直接预测大模型的一些指标。现有的基于缩放律的方法需要在最大的模型上进行超参数搜索，但由于资源有限，这是不切实际的。我们通过展示我们的发现表明，最大更新参数化（muP）使得可以在靠近常见损失流域的超参数的情况下准确拟合超参数的缩放律，而不需要任何搜索。因此，不同的模型可以在大尺度上进行损失预测，在训练开始之前就可以进行直接比较。我们提出了一种新的范式，作为可靠的学术研究的第一步，适用于任何模型规模，而不需大量的计算。代码将很快公开可用。",
