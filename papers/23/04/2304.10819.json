    "translated_abstract": "现实中收集的数据往往存在偏差、不平衡，并且有泄露敏感和隐私信息的风险。这一事实引发了创建合成数据集的想法，以减轻真实数据中固有的风险、偏见、伤害和隐私问题。这个概念依赖于生成AI模型，以产生不偏执、保护隐私的合成数据，同时忠实于真实数据。在这种新范式中，我们如何知道这种方法是否兑现了其承诺？我们提出了一个审计框架，提供了对合成数据集和基于它们训练的AI模型的全面评估，围绕偏见和歧视的预防、对真实数据的忠实程度、效用、鲁棒性和隐私保护。我们通过审计多个生成模型在不同用例中展示了我们的框架，包括教育、医疗保健、银行、人力资源，以及从表格，时间序列到自然语言的不同模态。我们的用例展示了在合成数据生成中平衡信任和效用的权衡的重要性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an auditing framework that holistically evaluates the effectiveness of synthetic datasets and AI models trained on them, including bias and discrimination prevention, fidelity to the real data, utility, robustness, and privacy preservation. The auditing framework balances the trade-offs between trust and utility in synthetic data generation across multiple use cases."
