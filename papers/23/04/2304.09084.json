Recommender systems aim to find the item who best suits the user, using his historical interactions.

Federated systems have shown that it is possible to make accurate and efficient recommendations without storing users' personal information. However, these systems use instantaneous feedback from the user. In this report, we propose DRIFT, a federated architecture for recommender systems, using implicit feedback.

    "translated_abstract": "现在网络上可用的物品越来越多，这使得用户很难找到他们喜欢的物品。推荐系统旨在使用用户的历史交互来找到最适合用户的物品。然而，这些交互可能更或更少敏感，并收集它们涉及到用户隐私的问题。联邦系统已经显示出即使在不存储用户个人信息的情况下也可以进行准确和有效的推荐。然而，这些系统使用用户的即时反馈。在本报告中，我们提出了DRIFT，一种使用隐式反馈的联合推荐系统架构。我们的学习模型基于最近用于隐式反馈推荐的算法SAROS。我们的目标是使推荐与SAROS一样精确，同时不损害用户的隐私。通过实验和收敛性的理论分析，我们展示了DRIFT的性能。",
