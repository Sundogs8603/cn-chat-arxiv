    "translated_abstract": "自动微分变分推断（ADVI）提供了多种现代概率编程语言中快速易用的后验近似方法。然而它的随机优化器缺乏明确的收敛标准，并且需要调整参数。此外，ADVI继承了均值场变分贝叶斯（MFVB）的较差后验不确定性估计。我们引入了“确定性ADVI”（DADVI）来解决这些问题。DADVI用固定的蒙特卡罗近似替换了MFVB的不可解目标，这一技术在随机优化文献中被称为“样本平均近似”（SAA）。通过优化近似但确定的目标，DADVI可以使用现成的二阶优化，而且与标准均值场ADVI不同的是，可以适用于更准确的后验线性响应（LR）协方差估计。与现有的最坏情况理论相反，我们表明，在某些常见的统计问题类别上，DADVI和SAA可以表现得更好。",
