    "abstract": "In conversational settings, individuals exhibit unique behaviors, rendering a one-size-fits-all approach insufficient for generating responses by dialogue agents. Although past studies have aimed to create personalized dialogue agents using speaker persona information, they have relied on the assumption that the speaker's persona is already provided. However, this assumption is not always valid, especially when it comes to chatbots utilized in industries like banking, hotel reservations, and airline bookings. This research paper aims to fill this gap by exploring the task of Speaker Profiling in Conversations (SPC). The primary objective of SPC is to produce a summary of persona characteristics for each individual speaker present in a dialogue. To accomplish this, we have divided the task into three subtasks: persona discovery, persona-type identification, and persona-value extraction. Given a dialogue, the first subtask aims to identify all utterances that contain persona information.",

    "translated_abstract": "在对话环境中，个体展现出独特的行为，使得“一刀切”的方法不足以为对话代理生成回应。虽然过去的研究旨在使用发言人个人信息创建个性化对话代理，但它们依赖于前提，即发言人个人特征已经被提供。然而，在像银行、酒店预订和航空预订等行业中使用的聊天机器人方面，这一假设并不总是正确的。本文旨在通过探索对话中的发言人个人特征分析 (SPC)任务来填补这个空白。SPC的主要目标是为对话中每个发言人产生个人特征摘要。为了实现这一目标，我们将任务分为三个子任务：个人特征发现、个人特征类型识别和个人特征价值提取。在给定对话的情况下，第一个子任务旨在识别包含个人信息的所有话语。",
