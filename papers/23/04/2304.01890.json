In our work, we simulate a few-shot setting for German and Hindi, using HASOC data for training and the Multilingual HateCheck (MHC) as a benchmark. We show that selecting shots based on our lexicon leads to models performing better on MHC than models trained on shots sampled randomly. Thus, when given only a few training examples, using our lexicon to select shots containing more sociocultural information leads to better few-shot perf",
