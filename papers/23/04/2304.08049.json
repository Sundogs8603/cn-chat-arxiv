    "abstract": "Damage functions in integrated assessment models (IAMs) map changes in climate to economic impacts and form the basis for most of estimates of the social cost of carbon. Implicit in these functions lies an unwarranted assumption that restricts the spatial variation (Svar) and temporal variability (Tvar) of changes in climate to be null. This could bias damage estimates and the climate policy advice from IAMs. While the effects of Tvar have been studied in the literature, those of Svar and their interactions with Tvar have not. Here we present estimates of the economic costs of climate change that account for both Tvar and Svar, as well as for the seasonality of damages across sectors. Contrary to the results of recent studies which show little effect that of Tvar on expected losses, we reveal that ignoring Svar produces large downward biases, as warming is highly heterogeneous over space. Using a conservative calibration for the damage function, we show that previous estimates are bias",

    "translated_abstract": "综合评估模型中的损伤函数将气候变化与经济影响联系起来，并成为大多数社会碳成本预估的基础。但其中的一个未经证实的假设限制了气候变化的时空变异性为零，这可能会导致经济损失估计和气候政策建议存在偏差。本文在考虑了各个领域损伤的季节变化后，提出了同时考虑时空变异性的气候变化经济成本预估。结果显示，与最近研究所示的对经济损失预估影响较小的Tvar相反，忽略Svar会产生大量偏差，因为气候变暖在空间上高度分异。应用保守的损伤函数校准，我们也展示了之前的预估存在偏差。",
