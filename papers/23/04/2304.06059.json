    "translated_abstract": "超低分辨率红外(IR)阵列传感器为人流量计算提供了一种低成本、能效高且保护隐私的解决方案，可用于占用监测等应用。以前的工作表明，深度学习(DL)在这个任务上可以获得卓越的性能。然而，文献缺乏一个对基于IR阵列的人流量计算的各种高效DL架构进行广泛比较分析的研究，这些架构不仅考虑了其准确性，还考虑了将其部署在记忆和能量受限的物联网(IoT)边缘节点上的成本。本研究通过比较6种不同的DL架构，在一个新颖的由商业8x8阵列收集的IR图像数据集上，进行了全面的探索。我们公开了这个数据集。在每种模型类型的广泛架构探索下，我们获得了一组富有成效的Pareto最优解，其交叉验证平衡准确性得分范围为55.70%-82.70%。当在S商业微控制器(MCU)上部署时，所有DL模型在测试集上均可实现实时性，并在省电模式下消耗极少的能量。",
