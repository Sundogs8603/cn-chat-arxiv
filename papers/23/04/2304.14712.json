    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个真实世界装箱问题的基准数据集。该数据集由12个实例组成，涵盖了不同大小和用户需求的问题复杂度水平（包含从38到53个包裹的数量）。实际上，我们考虑了几个面向真实世界的限制条件来构建这些实例：i)物品和箱子尺寸，ii)重量限制，iii)包类别之间的亲和性，iv)包装顺序的偏好和v)负载平衡。除了数据外，我们还提供了一个自主开发的Python脚本用于数据集生成，称为Q4RealBPP-DataGen。该基准首先被设计用于评估量子求解器，因此这组实例的特征是按照量子设备的当前限制设计的。此外，数据集生成器包含在内，允许构建通用基准。本文介绍的数据提供了一个基准，可以用来比较不同方法的性能和对比算法的效果。",
