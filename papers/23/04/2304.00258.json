    "abstract": "Recent developments in hardware and information technology have enabled the emergence of billions of connected, intelligent devices around the world exchanging information with minimal human involvement. This paradigm, known as the Internet of Things (IoT) is progressing quickly with an estimated 27 billion devices by 2025. This growth in the number of IoT devices and successful IoT services has generated a tremendous amount of data. However, this humongous volume of data poses growing concerns for user privacy. This introductory chapter has presented a brief survey of some of the existing data privacy-preservation schemes proposed by researchers in the field of the Internet of Things.",
