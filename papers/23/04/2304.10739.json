    "translated_abstract": "在烹饪实践中，确定成分的适当量对于丰富口感和促进健康至关重要。我们介绍了KitchenScale，这是一个经过Fine-tuned的预训练语言模型（PLM），根据食谱上下文预测目标成分的数量和测量单位。为了有效地训练我们的KitchenScale模型，我们制定了一个包括三个子任务的成分量预测任务，这些子任务是成分测量类型分类、单位分类和数量回归任务。此外，我们利用了从食谱文本到PLMs的烹饪知识的转移学习。我们采用了离散潜在指数（DExp）方法来应对食谱语料库中数字尺度的高方差。我们使用我们新构建的数据集和推荐示例进行实验，证明了KitchenScale理解各种食谱语境以及在预测成分量方面具有泛化性。我们实现了一个Web应用程序，为用户提供所需的用于所需人数食品量的配方特定的测量单位。",

Experimental results show KitchenScale's generalizability and understanding of various recipe contexts. A web application is also provided to offer users recipe-specific measurements for their desired number of servings."
