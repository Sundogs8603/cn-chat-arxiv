    "translated_abstract": "聚类旨在根据样本之间的相似性对未标记的样本进行分组。它已成为分析高维数据的重要工具。然而，大多数聚类方法仅生成伪标签，因此无法同时呈现不同簇和异常值之间的相似性。本文提出了一种新的框架，称为基于哈密顿回路的高维聚类（HCHC），以解决上述问题。首先，HCHC在一个目标函数中将全局结构与局部结构相结合，进行深度聚类，将标签改进为相对概率，以挖掘不同簇之间的相似性，同时保持每个簇内的局部结构。然后，通过簇相似性生成最优哈密顿回路上对不同簇的锚进行排序，并映射到圆的周长上。最后，对于一个更高概率属于某个簇的样本，它会映射到与之相应的锚点更近的位置。通过这种方式，分类效果得到了提高。",
