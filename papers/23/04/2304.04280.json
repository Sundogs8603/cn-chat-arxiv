    "abstract": "This paper introduces FrenchMedMCQA, the first publicly available Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) dataset in French for medical domain. It is composed of 3,105 questions taken from real exams of the French medical specialization diploma in pharmacy, mixing single and multiple answers. Each instance of the dataset contains an identifier, a question, five possible answers and their manual correction(s). We also propose first baseline models to automatically process this MCQA task in order to report on the current performances and to highlight the difficulty of the task. A detailed analysis of the results showed that it is necessary to have representations adapted to the medical domain or to the MCQA task: in our case, English specialized models yielded better results than generic French ones, even though FrenchMedMCQA is in French. Corpus, models and tools are available online.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了FrenchMedMCQA，这是公开发布的医学领域法语多项选择问题回答（MCQA）数据集。该数据集由3,105道真实的法国药学专业文凭考试题目组成，包括单项和多项选择题，每个实例包含标识符、问题、五个可能的答案和它们的手动纠正。我们还提出了第一个基线模型来自动处理该MCQA任务，以报告当前的性能和突出任务的难点。结果的详细分析显示，需要有适应于医学领域或MCQA任务的表示形式：在我们的情况下，即使FrenchMedMCQA是以法语书写的，英语专门的模型也比通用的法语模型表现更好。语料库、模型和工具都可在线获得。",
