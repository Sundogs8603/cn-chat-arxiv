    "translated_abstract": "在人口众多的国家，待处理的法律案件呈指数增长。有必要开发基于自然语言处理的技术，对法律文件进行处理和自动理解。为了促进在法律自然语言处理领域的研究，我们在 SemEval 2023 上组织了共享任务 LegalEval - 理解法律文本。LegalEval 任务有三个子任务：Task-A（修辞角色标记）是自动将法律文件结构化为语义连贯的单元，Task-B（法律命名实体识别）处理在法律文件中识别相关实体，而 Task-C（法院判决预测与解释）探索了自动预测法律案件结果以及提供预测解释的可能性。共有26个团队（分布在全球的约100名参与者）提交了系统论文。在每个子任务中，所提出的系统都优于基准线；但是，仍然有很大的改进空间。本文介绍了 LegalEval 任务的组织和细节，并概述了参与系统及其性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "SemEval 2023 organized a shared task - LegalEval, which aims to understand legal texts, including structuring legal documents automatically into semantically coherent units (Task-A), identifying relevant entities in legal documents (Task-B), and predicting the outcome of legal cases with explanation (Task-C). Though all 26 teams outperformed baselines in each sub-task, there is still much room for improvement."
