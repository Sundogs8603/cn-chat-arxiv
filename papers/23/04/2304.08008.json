    "abstract": "We study how decentralized utility transfer promises affect collective decision-making by voting. Committee members with varying levels of support and opposition for an efficient reform can make enforceable promises before voting. An equilibrium requires stability and minimal promises. Equilibrium promises exist and are indeterminate, but do share several key characteristics. Equilibria require transfer promises from high to low intensity members and result in enacting the reform. When reform supporters lack sufficient voting power, promises must reach across the aisle. Even if the coalition of reform supporters is decisive, promises must preclude the least enthusiastic supporters of the reform from being enticed to overturn the decision. In that case, equilibrium promises do not need to reach across the aisle. We also discuss a finite sequence of promises that achieve an equilibrium.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了去中心化的效用转移承诺如何影响投票方式的集体决策。在投票前，支持和反对高效改革的委员会成员可以进行可执行的承诺。一个均衡需要稳定性和最小化的承诺。平衡承诺是存在且不确定的，但具有许多共同的特征。需要高强度成员向低强度成员提供转移承诺，并导致改革的实施。当改革支持者缺乏足够的投票权时，承诺必须跨越阵营。即使改革支持者的联盟是决定性的，承诺也必须排除最不热衷于改革的支持者被诱导推翻决定。在这种情况下，平衡的承诺不需要跨越阵营。我们还讨论了一系列有限的承诺，实现达到一个平衡的状态。",
