However, there is currently a dearth of comprehensive study exploring its potential in the area of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC). To showcase its capabilities in GEC, we design zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) and few-shot CoT settings using in-context learning for ChatGPT. Our evaluation involves assessing ChatGPT's performance on five official test sets in three different languages, along with three document-level GEC test sets in English. Our experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate that ChatGPT has excellent error detection capabilities and can freely correct errors to make the corrected sentences very fluent, possibly due to its over-correction tendencies and not adhering to the principle of minimal edits. Additionally, its performance in non-English and low-resource settings highlights its potential",

    "translated_abstract": "基于GPT-3.5先进架构的大规模语言模型ChatGPT在各种自然语言处理任务中展示了显著的潜力。然而，目前还缺乏全面的研究探索其在语法纠错领域的潜力。为了展示其在语法纠错方面的能力，我们设计了零样本推理（zero-shot chain-of-thought, CoT）和少样本推理（few-shot CoT）设置，利用上下文学习来训练ChatGPT。我们的评估涉及在三种不同语言中对ChatGPT在五个官方测试集和三个英文文档级GEC测试集上的表现进行评估。我们的实验结果和人工评估表明，ChatGPT具有出色的错误检测能力，并且可以自由地纠正错误使得纠正后的句子非常流畅，可能是由于其过度纠正倾向和不遵守最小改动原则。此外，在非英语和低资源环境下的表现突出了其潜力。",
