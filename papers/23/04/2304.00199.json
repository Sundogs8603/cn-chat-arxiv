    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了引入于[Nurbekyan et al.，2020]的无碰撞运输图在图像数据的流形学习中的应用。近年来，在表示类似运动或变形现象的数据中，应用基于运输的距离和特征的研究大幅增加。事实上，固定位置比较强度通常无法显示数据结构。在[Nurbekyan et al.，2020]中开发的无碰撞图和距离类似于最优传输(OT)图的几何特征但由于无需优化，计算成本要便宜得多。本文证明无碰撞距离提供单个概率测度的平移(分别是伸缩)和装备欧几里得距离的平移(分别是伸缩)向量之间的等距性。此外，我们证明，无碰撞运输图以及OT和线性OT图，一般来说不能为旋转提供等距性。",
