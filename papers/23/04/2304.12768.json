    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the energy flow and energy characteristics of the robot system. We consider factors such as friction and passive pendulation in the robot transmission system and propose a model to analyze their impact on energy flow. Through simulation and experimentation, we find that energy flow is mainly affected by friction and passive pendulation, and propose key parameters and energy characteristics for further study."
