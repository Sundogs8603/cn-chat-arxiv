    "translated_abstract": "切片Wasserstein（SW）距离被广泛认为是两个概率测度之间的一种统计有效且计算高效的度量。SW距离的一个关键部分是切片分布。目前有两种方法来选择这个分布。第一种方法是使用固定的先验分布。第二种是优化归属于参数分布族的最佳分布，并且可以最大化期望的距离。然而，这两种方法都有局限性。固定的先验分布在突出能够区分两个常规概率测度的投影方向方面缺乏信息。而优化最佳分布通常是昂贵和不稳定的。此外，设计候选分布的参数分布族可能会很容易被错误指定。为了解决这些问题，我们提出将切片分布设计为基于能量的分布，并将其参数化，从而使其更加通用而稳健。",
