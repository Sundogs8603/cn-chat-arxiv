    "translated_abstract": "体感人工智能研究和开发具备物理或虚拟实体（即机器人）并能够与环境动态交互的智能系统。记忆和控制是体感系统的两个基本部分，通常需要分别使用框架进行建模。本文提出了一个新的、可推广的框架，称为LLM-Brain：使用大规模语言模型作为机器人大脑，统一自我中心记忆和控制。LLM-Brain框架集成了多个多模态语言模型用于机器人任务，利用零-shot学习方法。LLM-Brain中的所有组件使用自然语言进行封闭式多轮对话，包括感知、规划、控制和记忆。系统的核心是一个具备自我中心记忆和控制机器人的实体LLM。我们通过研究两个下游任务：主动探索和实体问答来演示LLM-Brain。",
