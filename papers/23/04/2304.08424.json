Theoretically, we prove that the simplest linear analogue of our model can achieve near optimal error rate for linear dynamical systems (LDS) under some assumptions.

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，相比于基于Transformer的方法，简单的线性模型在长期时间序列预测中表现更好。鉴于此，我们提出了一种基于多层感知机(MLP)的编码器-解码器模型，即时间序列稠密编码器(TiDE)，用于长期时间序列预测。它既享有线性模型的简单性和速度，又能处理协变量和非线性依赖。从理论上讲，我们证明了我们模型的最简线性类比在一些假设下可以达到线性动态系统(LDS)的近乎最优误差率。实证上，我们表明，我们的方法可以在流行的长期时间序列预测基准测试中匹配或胜过以前的方法，同时比最佳的基于Transformer的模型快5-10倍。",
