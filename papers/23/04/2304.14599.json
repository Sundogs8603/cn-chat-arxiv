    "translated_abstract": "自动检测仇恨言论的主要挑战之一是缺乏涵盖范围广泛的有偏见和无偏见言论且标注一致的数据集。本文提出了一种标注程序，解决了已标注数据集中常见的一些弱点。本文关注Twitter上的反犹太主义言论，并通过使用相关关键词从具有代表性的样本中提取涵盖2021年1月至2021年12月关于犹太人、以色列和反犹太主义的常见话题的6,941个推文，创建了一个标注数据集。我们的标注过程旨在严格应用一种广泛使用的反犹太主义定义，强制注释者指定所适用的定义部分，并让他们有选择地就个案表达不同意见。标注呼吁反对反犹太主义、报告反犹太主义或与反犹太主义有关但实际上不属于反犹太主义的推文可以帮助减少误判。",
