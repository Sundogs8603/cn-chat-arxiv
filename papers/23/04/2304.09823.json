However, extensive concerns are also raised about the potential ethical issues, especially about whether ChatGPT-like artificial general intelligence (AGI) will replace human jobs. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a preliminary data-driven study on the future of ChatGPT-enabled labor market from the view of Human-AI Symbiosis instead of Human-AI Confrontation. To be specific, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of large-scale job posting data in BOSS Zhipin, the largest online recruitment platform in China. The results indicate that about 28% of occupations in the current labor market require ChatGPT-related skills. Furthermore, based on a large-scale occupation-centered knowledge graph, we develop a semantic information enhanced collaborative filtering algorithm to predict the future occupation-skill",

    "translated_abstract": "作为一个非凡的大型语言模型，ChatGPT在各种现实任务中取得了无与伦比的成功并越来越在我们的日常生活和工作中扮演重要角色。然而，人们也提出了广泛的担忧，特别是关于ChatGPT样的人工通用智能（AGI）是否会取代人类工作。因此，在本文中，我们从人工智能协作而不是对立的角度介绍了ChatGPT启用的劳动力市场的未来的初步数据驱动研究。具体来说，我们首先对中国最大的在线招聘平台BOSS直聘中的大规模职位发布数据进行深入分析。结果表明，当前劳动力市场约有28％的职业需要ChatGPT相关技能。此外，基于大规模基于职业的知识图谱，我们开发了一个语义信息增强的协同过滤算法，以预测未来职业技能。",
