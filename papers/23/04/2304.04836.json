    "translated_abstract": "知识选择是基于知识的对话系统中的关键问题，它旨在根据对话历史选择适当的知识片段用于回复。以往的研究主要采用分类方法独立地将每个候选片段分类为“相关”或“不相关”，但这种方法忽略了片段之间的交互作用，导致推断片段含义的困难，并且缺乏对话-知识相互作用的语篇结构建模。我们提出了一个称为GenKS的简单而有效的生成式知识选择方法。GenKS学习通过使用序列到序列模型生成它们的标识符来选择片段。因此，GenKS通过关注机制天然地捕捉了知识内部的交互作用。同时，我们设计了一个超链接机制来显式地建模对话-知识交互。我们在三个基准数据集上进行了实验，并验证了GenKS在相关性、多样性以及生成适当回复的能力方面取得了最先进的性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a simple and effective method called GenKS for knowledge selection in knowledge-grounded dialogues. It captures and addresses the intra-knowledge interactions by generating identifiers for knowledge snippets, and explicitly models the dialogue-knowledge interactions through a hyperlink mechanism. GenKS achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of relevance, diversity, and generating appropriate responses."
