    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种混合神经网络(NN)和偏微分方程(PDE)方法,用于从运动观测中学习可推广的PDE动力学。许多NN方法学习端到端的模型,隐含地建模了所建立的PDE和本构模型(或材料模型)。这些方法没有明确的PDE知识,不能保证物理正确性,具有有限的广泛适用性。我们认为,所建立的PDEs通常是众所周知的,应该明确强制执行,而不是学习。相反,本构模型由于其数据拟合性质,特别适合于学习。为此,我们介绍了一种称为“神经本构法”(NCLaw)的新框架,它利用了一种严格保证标准本构先验的网络架构,包括旋转等变性和未变形状态平衡。我们将这个网络嵌入可微分的模拟中,通过最小化基于模拟和m之间的差异的损失函数来训练模型",
