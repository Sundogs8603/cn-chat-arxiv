    "translated_abstract": "近年来，电动汽车数量的激增创造了开发廉价高能量密度电池储存系统的需求。许多国家已经采取了具体措施来减少并随后限制由化石燃料驱动的车辆的数量。目前，基于锂离子电池的电池主导了电动汽车行业。能源研究也着重于对这些电池的状态进行准确计算，以提供可靠的车辆续航里程估计。虽然这种估算算法提供了精确的估计，但文献中所有现有技术都假定有优质电池数据集可用。事实上，电池科学家很难获得专有电池使用数据集。此外，开放访问数据集缺乏构建广义模型所需的多种电池充电/放电模式。整理电池测量数据很耗时，需要昂贵的设备。为了克服这种语言障碍和缺乏高质量电池研究数据集的问题，本文提出了一种用于生成多样化和高保真度合成电池数据集的深度学习方法。",
