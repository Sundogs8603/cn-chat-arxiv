    "abstract": "In this technical report, we describe Neonatal Resuscitation Training Simulator (NRTS), an Android mobile app designed to support medical experts to input, transmit and record data during a High-Fidelity Simulation course for neonatal resuscitation. This mobile app allows one to automatically send all the recorded data from \"Neonatal Intensive Care Unit\" (NICU) of Casale Monferrato Children's Hospital, (Italy) to a server located at the Department of Science and Technological Innovation (DiSIT), University of Piemonte Orientale (Italy). Finally, the medical instructor can view statistics on a simulation exercise that may be used during the de-briefing phase for the evaluation of multidisciplinary teams involved in the simulation scenarios.",
