    "abstract": "Fairness in AI has garnered quite some attention in research, and increasingly also in society. The so-called \"Impossibility Theorem\" has been one of the more striking research results with both theoretical and practical consequences, as it states that satisfying a certain combination of fairness measures is impossible. To date, this negative result has not yet been complemented with a positive one: a characterization of which combinations of fairness notions are possible. This work aims to fill this gap by identifying maximal sets of commonly used fairness measures that can be simultaneously satisfied. The fairness measures used are demographic parity, equal opportunity, false positive parity, predictive parity, predictive equality, overall accuracy equality and treatment equality. We conclude that in total 12 maximal sets of these fairness measures are possible, among which seven combinations of two measures, and five combinations of three measures. Our work raises interest questions",

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能中的公平性已经引起了研究和社会的广泛关注。所谓的“不可能定理”是一个更为显著的研究结果，它具有理论和实践后果，因为它认为满足一定组合的公平性措施是不可能的。迄今为止，这个负面结果还没有得到积极的补充:即对哪些公平性观念的组合是可能的进行描述。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过识别可以同时满足的常用公平性措施的最大集来实现这一目标。使用的公平性措施是人口比例平等、平等机会、误判率平等、预测准确性平等、总体准确性平等和治疗平等。我们得出结论，总共有12个这些公平性措施的最大集是可能的，其中有七种两个措施的组合和五种三个措施的组合。我们的工作引起了一些有趣的问题。",
