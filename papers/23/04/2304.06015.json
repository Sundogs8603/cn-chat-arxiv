    "translated_abstract": "心脏疾病已经取代癌症成为全球最大的死因。及早发现和治疗可以降低多种心脏病相关的并发症、死亡率和诊断成本。医疗行业收集了大量医疗数据，但尚未很好地开发。在这些数据中发现之前未知的模式和联系可以帮助更好地预测心脏疾病的风险。在本研究中，我们使用心脏疾病数据集构建了一个基于机器学习的心脏病诊断系统。我们使用了许多数据预处理技术，如异常值检测和去除、缺失值检测和去除、特征规范化、交叉验证等，并使用9种分类算法和8种分类器性能度量指标。为了提高预测准确率，我们采用了堆叠集成技术，将多个基模型的预测结果进行组合，这些基模型使用不同的算法类型和参数设置进行训练。实验结果表明，所提出的集成模型胜过了单个模型，并使用Matthews相关系数作为性能度量指标，实现了91.8%的高预测准确率。",
