    "translated_abstract": "欧盟委员会发布了新的关于人工智能（AI）的法规框架草案，提出了一种新的基于风险的法律方法。草案强调需要为不同的AI用途开发充分的风险评估。这种风险评估应包括检测和减轻AI中的偏差。本文分析了测量自动决策系统中偏差的统计方法。我们的实验重点是人脸识别技术。我们提出了一种新的测量机器学习模型中偏差的方式，该方式基于N-Sigma方法的统计方法。N-Sigma是一种流行的统计方法，用于验证一般科学（如物理和社会领域）中的假设，其应用于机器学习尚未得到探索。在本文中，我们研究如何应用这种方法来开发基于偏差分析的新风险评估框架，并讨论其主要优缺点。",
