    "abstract": "Extracting entities and relations is an essential task of information extraction. Triplets extracted from a sentence might overlap with each other. Previous methods either did not address the overlapping issues or solved overlapping issues partially. To tackle triplet overlapping problems completely, firstly we extract candidate subjects with a standard span mechanism. Then we present a labeled span mechanism to extract the objects and relations simultaneously, we use the labeled span mechanism to generate labeled spans whose start and end positions indicate the objects, and whose labels correspond to relations of subject and objects. Besides, we design an entity attention mechanism to enhance the information fusion between subject and sentence during extracting objects and relations. We test our method on two public datasets, our method achieves the best performances on these two datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "提取实体和关系是信息提取的基本任务。从一条句子中提取的三元组可能会有重叠。先前的方法没有解决重叠问题或解决了部分重叠问题。为了完全解决重叠问题，首先我们使用标准span机制提取候选主题。然后，我们提出了一种带标签的span机制，同时提取了对象和关系。我们使用带标签的span机制生成带标签的span，其起始和结束位置表示对象，标签对应于主题和对象的关系。此外，我们设计了实体关注机制，增强了在提取对象和关系期间主题和句子之间的信息融合。我们在两个公共数据集上测试了我们的方法，我们的方法在这两个数据集上取得了最好的性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes a method called SpanRE for extracting entities and overlapping relations. It uses a standard span mechanism to extract candidate subjects and a labeled span mechanism to extract objects and relations simultaneously. The method also incorporates an entity attention mechanism for enhancing the fusion of information. Performance evaluations on two public datasets demonstrate that SpanRE achieves state-of-the-art results."
