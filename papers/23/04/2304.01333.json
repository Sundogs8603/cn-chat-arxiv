    "translated_abstract": "对于确定一个整数是否能够被2、3或其他质数整除这样的任务，对于人类来说可能很简单，但在没有预先指定算法的情况下，这对于计算机来说可能并不容易。本文测试了多个深度学习体系结构和特征工程方法，并评估了在确定大有限整数（高达$2^{32}$）是否能够被小质数整除的情况下，各种框架和网络结构（CNN、RNN、Transformer等）的能力。结果表明，预测质数整除性的能力极大地取决于提供给深度学习模型的特征空间，而不是网络框架或网络结构的复杂性（CNN、RNN、Transformer等）。我们还评估了来自亚马逊、谷歌和微软的商业可用的自动化机器学习（AutoML）管道，并证明除非提供适当的特征工程，否则它们无法解决此问题。我们进一步提出了一个封闭式解决方案来解决这个问题。",
