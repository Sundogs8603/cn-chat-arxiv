    "translated_abstract": "深度机器学习模型包括卷积神经网络(CNN)已成功地应用于使用医学图像、问卷和视频检测轻度认知障碍(MCI)。本文提出了一种新的多分支分类器-视频视觉变换器(MC-ViViT)模型，通过分析面部特征区分MCI和正常认知。数据来自I-CONECT，一个旨在通过提供频繁视频聊天来改善认知功能的行为干预试验。MC-ViViT在一个分支中提取视频的时空特征，并通过MC模块增强表示。由于I-CONECT数据集中的样本不平衡问题（包含难易和正负样本），这使MC-ViViT的性能受到影响。我们提出了一种Hard-Easy和Positive-Negative样本的损失函数（HP Loss）来结合对比度调节损失Focal loss和AD-CORRE loss来解决不平衡问题。我们在I-CONECT数据集上的实验结果显示出该算法的有效性。",
