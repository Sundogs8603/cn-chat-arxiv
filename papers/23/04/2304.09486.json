    "translated_abstract": "现在，语音助手应用已经无处不在。提供现实生活中两个最重要功能（如谷歌家庭、亚马逊Alexa、Siri等）的两个主要模型是自动语音识别（ASR）模型和说话人识别（SI）模型。根据最近的研究，随着物联网（IoT）的快速发展，安全和隐私威胁也出现了。研究的安全问题包括针对语音助手应用程序中广泛使用的机器学习模型和其他硬件组件的攻击技术。隐私问题包括技术上的信息窃取和政策上的隐私泄露。语音助手应用程序每年占据着不断增长的市场份额，但它们的隐私和安全问题一直在造成巨大的经济损失并危及用户的个人敏感信息。因此，有必要进行全面的调查，以概述当前研究的分类。",
