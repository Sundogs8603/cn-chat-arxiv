    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了广义类别发现（GCD）的问题。GCD考虑了自动聚类部分标记数据集的开放世界问题，在该数据集中，未标记数据包含来自新类别和已标记类别的实例。本文解决了在未标记数据中没有已知类别数的GCD问题。我们提出了一个名为CiPR的框架，通过利用部分标记数据中被现有方法忽视的跨实例正关系进行对比学习来引导表示。为了获得可靠的跨实例关系以促进表示学习，我们首先引入了一种半监督的分层聚类算法，称为选择邻居聚类（SNC），它可以直接从由选择邻居构造的图中的连通分量中生成聚类层次结构。我们还扩展了SNC以便对具有给定类的未标记实例进行标签分配。",
