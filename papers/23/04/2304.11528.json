To this end, we propose TriSIM4Rec, a triple structural information modeling method for accurate, explainable and interactive recommendation on dynamic interaction graphs. Specifically, TriSIM4Rec consists of 1) a dynamic ideal low-pass graph filter to dynamically mine co-occurrence information in user-item interactions, which is implemented by incremental singular value decomposition (SVD); 2) a parameter-free attention module to capture sequential information of user interactions effectively and efficiently; and 3) an item transition matrix to store the transition probabilities of item pairs.",

    "translated_abstract": "在动态交互图中，用户与物品的交互通常遵循异构模式，表示为不同的结构信息，如用户-物品共现、用户交互的时序信息和物品对的转移概率。然而，现有方法不能同时利用这三种结构信息，导致表现不佳。为此，我们提出了TriSIM4Rec，一种基于三元结构信息建模的动态交互图准确、可解释和交互式推荐方法。具体地，TriSIM4Rec包括1)一个动态理想低通图滤波器，通过增量奇异值分解（SVD）动态地挖掘用户-物品交互中的共现信息；2)一个无需参数的注意力模块，以有效、高效地捕获用户交互的时序信息；和3)一个物品转移矩阵以存储物品对的转移概率。",
