    "abstract": "Leveraging medical record information in the era of big data and machine learning comes with the caveat that data must be cleaned and deidentified. Facilitating data sharing and harmonization for multi-center collaborations are particularly difficult when protected health information (PHI) is contained or embedded in image meta-data. We propose a novel library in the Python framework, called PyLogik, to help alleviate this issue for ultrasound images, which are particularly challenging because of the frequent inclusion of PHI directly on the images. PyLogik processes the image volumes through a series of text detection/extraction, filtering, thresholding, morphological and contour comparisons. This methodology deidentifies the images, reduces file sizes, and prepares image volumes for applications in deep learning and data sharing. To evaluate its effectiveness in the identification of regions of interest (ROI), a random sample of 50 cardiac ultrasounds (echocardiograms) were processed",

    "translated_abstract": "应用大数据和机器学习在医疗记录信息方面须注意，必须清洗和去标识化数据。当受保护的健康信息嵌入在影像元数据中时，促进多中心合作中数据共享和协调变得尤其困难。我们提出了一个新的Python框架下的库，称为PyLogik，帮助解决超声图像特别具有挑战性的数据清洗问题，因为这些图像直接包含很多PHI。PyLogik通过一系列的文本检测/提取、过滤、阈值化、形态学和轮廓比较处理图像体积。这种方法去标识化图像，减小文件大小，并为深度学习和数据共享应用准备好了图像数据。为了评估PyLogik在兴趣区域（ROI）的识别有效性，随机抽取了50张心脏超声图像（超声心动图）进行处理。",
