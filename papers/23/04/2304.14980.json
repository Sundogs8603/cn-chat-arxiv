    "translated_abstract": "Kemeny问题是计算选举的中位数共识排名的重要问题，具有生物学和计算社会选择等重要应用，并通过Gilbert等人的有趣的集合方法最近得到了推广。我们的第一组结果确定了传统Kemeny中位数问题的一致性属性和著名的Betzler等人的3/4多数规则的最优量化扩展。此外，通过详细列出数量化公理属性（如Condorcet和Smith准则，5/6多数规则等）的详尽清单，我们发现对于3个候选人的子集的优胜者之间不仅考虑成对比较还要考虑不一致性，由3-方式Kemeny规则引出的3-方式Kendall-tau距离诱导的3-方式Kemeny投票方案与传统Kemeny规则相比具有有趣的优势。",
