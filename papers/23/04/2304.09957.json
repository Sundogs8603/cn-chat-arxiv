    "abstract": "Bilingual word lexicons are crucial tools for multilingual natural language understanding and machine translation tasks, as they facilitate the mapping of words in one language to their synonyms in another language. To achieve this, numerous papers have explored bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) in high-resource scenarios, using a typical pipeline consisting of two unsupervised steps: bitext mining and word alignment, both of which rely on pre-trained large language models~(LLMs).  In this paper, we present an analysis of the BLI pipeline for German and two of its dialects, Bavarian and Alemannic. This setup poses several unique challenges, including the scarcity of resources, the relatedness of the languages, and the lack of standardization in the orthography of dialects. To evaluate the BLI outputs, we analyze them with respect to word frequency and pairwise edit distance.

    "translated_abstract": "双语单词词典是多语言自然语言理解和机器翻译任务的关键工具，因为它们有助于将一种语言中的单词映射到另一种语言中的同义词。本文分析了德语及其两种方言（巴伐利亚和阿勒曼尼亚）的双语词典归纳过程，该过程存在资源稀缺、语言相关性以及方言拼写标准化缺失等独特挑战。为了评估输出结果，我们分析了单词频率和成对编辑距离。此外，我们发布了两个评估数据集，包括1500个双语句子对和1000个双语单词对。",
