    "translated_abstract": "软测量由于其在设备上的干预较少且成本低廉而变得越来越受欢迎。在石油和天然气生产中，虚拟流量计（VFM）是一种流行的软测量方法，试图实时估计复相流量。VFM基于模型，这些模型需要校准。校准高度依赖应用程序，既因为模型的多样性，也因为可用测量的多样性。通过仔细调整VFM参数以满足井测试可实现最精确的校准，但这可能是繁重的，而且并不是所有的井都有频繁的井测试数据可用。本文提出了一种基于生产分离器提供的测量，以及观察到的流量应该等于每个单独井的流量之和的假设，可以连续地联合校准VFMs的方法。该方法应用顺序蒙特卡罗（SMC）方法来估计VFM模型的参数。在合成数据上的结果表明，所提出的方法可以在单独井流量高度不平衡的情况下提供准确且连续的VFM校准。",
