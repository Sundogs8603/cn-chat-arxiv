    "translated_abstract": "本研究侧重于对连续时间动态图网络（CTDGNs）进行长期预测（LTF），这对于现实世界建模非常重要。现有的CTDGN对于建模时间图数据非常有效，因为它们能够捕捉复杂的时间相关性，但由于对历史数据的实质要求，它们在LTF方面表现不佳，在大多数情况下也不切实际。为了解决这个问题，最直观的方法是数据增强。在本研究中，我们提出了一种插入式模块——不确定性掩蔽混合（UmmU），它能够进行不确定性估计，将不确定性引入CTDGN的中间层嵌入中，并进行掩蔽混合以进一步增强嵌入的不确定性，使其能够适用于更多情况，而且可以轻松地插入到任意CTDGN中，而不增加参数数量。我们在三个真实世界的动态图数据集上进行了全面的实验，并表明UmmU在LTF任务上明显优于现有方法。",
