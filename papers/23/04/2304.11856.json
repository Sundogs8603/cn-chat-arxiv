    "translated_abstract": "在金融工程中，投资组合优化一直是持续关注的问题。投资组合优化是一种调节资产分布以最大化预期回报并最小化风险的过程。为了获得预期收益，近年来已经探索了深度学习模型。然而，由于模型的确定性特性，传统的深度学习模型难以考虑投资组合的风险因素，因为这些模型不知道它们的预测有多可靠。为了解决这个限制，本文提出了一种概率模型，即预测性辅助分类生成对抗网络（PredACGAN）。提出的PredACGAN利用了ACGAN框架的特征，即生成器的输出形成一个分布。虽然ACGAN还没有用于预测模型，通常用于图像样本生成，但本文提出了一种将ACGAN结构用于概率和预测模型的方法。此外，本文提出了一种量化预测不确定性的方法，可以用于衡量投资组合的风险。实证结果表明，所提出的PredACGAN模型优于传统的深度学习模型，并为投资组合优化提供了更好的风险衡量。",
