    "abstract": "Carrot is a famous nutritional vegetable and developed all over the world. Different diseases of Carrot has become a massive issue in the carrot production circle which leads to a tremendous effect on the economic growth in the agricultural sector. An automatic carrot disease detection system can help to identify malicious carrots and can provide a guide to cure carrot disease in an earlier stage, resulting in a less economical loss in the carrot production system. The proposed research study has developed a web application Carrot Cure based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which can identify a defective carrot and provide a proper curative solution. Images of carrots affected by cavity spot and leaf bright as well as healthy images were collected. Further, this research work has employed Convolutional Neural Network to include birth neural purposes and a Fully Convolutional Neural Network model (FCNN) for infection order. Different avenues regarding different convolutional model",

    "translated_abstract": "胡萝卜是世界各地广泛种植的营养蔬菜。不同的胡萝卜病害已成为胡萝卜生产领域的重大问题，这对农业经济增长产生了巨大影响。自动化的胡萝卜病害检测系统可以帮助识别有害胡萝卜，并提供早期治疗指南，减少对胡萝卜生产系统的经济损失。本研究提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的网络应用程序“胡萝卜治疗”，可识别有病害的胡萝卜并提供适当的治疗方案。收集了受溶洞和亮叶影响的胡萝卜的图像以及健康图像。此外，本研究采用卷积神经网络进行出生神经目的的探讨和完全卷积神经网络模型（FCNN）进行感染顺序的探索。",
