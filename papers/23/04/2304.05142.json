    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一名决策者如何激励比他更具意识的专家揭示新奇情况。特别地，决策者将采取一个行动，决定与不确定性的解决一起，为两个玩家提供回报。本文确定了确保完全揭示所需的承诺水平：任何完全揭示的激励方案等效于一款动态游戏，在每一轮中，决策者提出一项行动计划，专家选择揭示一些新奇情况。当没有新奇情况被揭示并且专家选择实施哪个提议的计划时，游戏结束。也就是说，决策者必须能够承诺，一旦提出了行动计划，就不能撤回。然后，我考虑了强大策略的集合——这些策略可以在专家的任何可能意识类型的情况下最大化最坏情况下的结果，并证明它们的特征是一个关于近视最优化试验的原则；在任何给定的决策点上，决策者都有动力揭示可能情况。",
