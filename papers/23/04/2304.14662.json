    "translated_abstract": "长文档逐句信息提取是一项繁琐且容易出错的任务。作为文档结构的指示器，目录自然地将文档分成段落并提供有益的级联语义，有助于减少搜索空间。尽管目录很有用，但在没有外部知识的帮助下，很难提取目录。对于遵循特定模板的文档，正则表达式可用于提取目录。然而，在处理来自不同来源和不同格式的文档时，手工启发式规则不适用。为解决这个问题，我们建立了一个大规模手动注释的语料库，这是目录从文档中提取（CED）任务的第一个数据集。基于此语料库，我们提出了一个基于转换的框架，用于将文档解析成目录树。实验结果表明，我们提出的方法优于基准系统，并具有良好的迁移能力。我们认为",
