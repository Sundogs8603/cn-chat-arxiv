    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML），包括深度学习，最近在广泛的应用中获得了巨大的流行。然而，与传统软件一样，ML应用也不免于由程序错误导致的错误。显式的编程错误通常通过错误消息和堆栈跟踪表现出来。这些堆栈跟踪描述了导致异常情况的函数调用链。事实上，这些异常可能跨越整个软件堆栈（包括应用程序和库）。因此，研究堆栈跟踪中的模式可以帮助实践者和研究人员了解ML应用程序中异常的原因以及ML开发人员面临的挑战。为此，我们在Stack Overflow（SO）上进行挖掘并研究了与七个流行的Python ML库相关的11,449个堆栈跟踪。首先，我们观察到包含堆栈跟踪的ML问题比没有堆栈跟踪的问题更受欢迎；然而，它们更不可能得到接受。",
