    "abstract": "The digital transformation of automation places new demands on data acquisition and processing in industrial processes. Logical relationships between acquired data and cyclic process sequences must be correctly interpreted and evaluated. To solve this problem, a novel approach based on evolutionary algorithms is proposed to self optimise the system logic of complex processes. Based on the genetic results, a programme code for the system implementation is derived by decoding the solution. This is achieved by a flexible system structure with an upstream, intermediate and downstream unit. In the intermediate unit, a directed learning process interacts with a system replica and an evaluation function in a closed loop. The code generation strategy is represented by redundancy and priority, sequencing and performance derivation. The presented approach is evaluated on an industrial liquid station process subject to a multi-objective optimisation problem.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动化的数字化转型对工业过程中的数据采集和处理提出了新的要求。获得的数据与周期性的过程序列之间的逻辑关系必须得到正确的解释和评估。为了解决这个问题，提出了一种基于进化算法的新方法，用于自我优化复杂过程的系统逻辑。基于遗传结果，通过解码解决方案来得到系统实现的程序代码。这是通过一个具有上游、中游和下游单元的灵活系统结构实现的。在中间单元中，一个有向学习过程与系统副本和评估函数在闭环中交互。代码生成策略由冗余和优先级、排序和性能派生表示。该方法在一个工业液体站过程上进行了评估，该过程面临多目标优化问题。",
