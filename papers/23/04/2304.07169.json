    "translated_abstract": "太阳活动是我们太阳系变化的主要驱动因素，也是影响地球和近地空间的空间天气现象的关键来源。来自太阳动力学台站（SDO）的高分辨率极紫外线观测（EUV）记录提供了一个前所未有的庞大太阳图像数据集。在这项工作中，我们利用这个全面数据集来研究当前最先进的生成模型的能力，以准确捕捉观察到的太阳活动状态背后的数据分布。我们从基于StyleGAN的方法开始，发现该模型在处理高分辨率样本时处理太阳图像的细节存在严重缺陷，而处理自然面部图像时则相反。当转换为基于扩散的生成模型族时，我们观察到对细节生成的明显改进。对于GAN族，我们能够在牺牲一些较大比例的细节情况下实现类似的细节生成改进。此外，我们还研究了生成图像的视觉质量、多样性，以及旨在评估其作为太阳观测图像模型的准确性和真实性的一些度量标准。",
