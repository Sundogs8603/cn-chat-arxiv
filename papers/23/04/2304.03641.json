    "translated_abstract": "具有正交约束的非光滑组合优化在统计学习和数据科学中有广泛的应用。由于其非凸性和非光滑性质，该问题通常很难求解。现有的解决方案受到以下一个或多个限制的限制：（i）它们是需要每次迭代高计算成本的全梯度方法；（ii）它们无法解决一般的非光滑组合问题；（iii）它们是不可行方法，并且只能在极限点处实现解的可行性；（iv）它们缺乏严格的收敛保证；（v）它们只能获得关键点的弱最优性。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的块坐标下降方法OBCD，用于解决正交约束下的一般非光滑组合问题。OBCD是一种可行的方法，具有低的计算复杂性。在每次迭代中，我们的算法会更新...",
