    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在将声发射（AE）等多模式传感器数据中的时频模式与DED过程中的孔隙率形成进行高空间（0.5mm）和时间（<1ms）的关联。通过采用可解释的AI方法中的LIME（局部可解释性非特定性解释），将AE中的某些高频波形特征归因于DED过程中的两个主要孔隙形成途径：飞溅事件和低热量输入下相邻打印轨迹的不充分熔合。该方法为实时预测每个沃克塞尔（0.5mm）中的气孔存在提供了令人兴奋的可能性，这是与先前努力相比的一个重大飞跃。在打印并随后加工SS316L材料样品时，同步采集了包括力，AE，振动和温度在内的多模式传感器数据。深度卷积神经网络分类器用于识别两种孔隙形成途径的AE特征，然后使用可解释AI方法进一步分析这些特征。结果表明，利用多模式传感器融合技术和AI方法预测DED打印部件中的原位表面孔隙率的潜力。",
