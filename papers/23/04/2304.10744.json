    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是一种机器学习方法，可以创建用于强大应用程序的共享模型，同时允许数据保留在设备上，提供了改进的数据隐私性、安全性和降低的延迟等优点。然而，在某些系统中，客户端和服务器之间的直接通信可能不可能，例如没有适当通信基础设施的远程地区。为了解决这一问题，提出了一种新的框架 FedEx（通过模型传递实现联邦学习），这个框架利用移动传输器，如无人机，建立了服务器和客户端之间的间接通信通道。这些传输器作为中介，允许模型信息的交换。间接通信的使用为收敛分析和优化带来了新的挑战，因为传输器运动引入的延迟对全局模型分发和本地模型收集都会产生问题。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种联合客户端分配和无人机路径规划方法，优化了移动传输器的使用，同时最小化总体训练时间和通信成本。",

To optimize the use of mobile transporters and minimize the overall training time and communication costs, a joint approach for client assignment and UAV route planning is proposed."
