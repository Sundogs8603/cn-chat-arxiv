    "translated_abstract": "手术后切除程度是诊断为胶质母细胞瘤患者的主要预后因素之一。为了实现这一目标，准确地将术后 MR 图像中的残留肿瘤进行分割和分类至关重要。目前，用于估计残留肿瘤的标准方法存在高度的性间和性内评分人员差异性，而自动化的方法可在早期术后 MRI 中实现残留肿瘤的分割，从而更准确地估计切除程度。本研究训练了两种最新的预操作分割神经网络架构以完成此任务。这些模型在涵盖欧洲和美国12家医院的近1000名患者的多中心数据集上得到广泛验证。最佳性能达到了61\\%的Dice分数和约80\\%的均衡准确性分类性能，并展示了模型在不同医院之间有效泛化的能力。此外，最佳模型的分割性能得到了显著的提高。",
