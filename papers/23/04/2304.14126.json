    "abstract": "It is challenging to quantify numerical preferences for different objectives in a multi-objective decision-making problem. However, the demonstrations of a user are often accessible. We propose an algorithm to infer linear preference weights from either optimal or near-optimal demonstrations. The algorithm is evaluated in three environments with two baseline methods. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements compared to the baseline algorithms, in terms of both time requirements and accuracy of the inferred preferences. In future work, we plan to evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness in a multi-agent system, where one of the agents is enabled to infer the preferences of an opponent using our preference inference algorithm.",
