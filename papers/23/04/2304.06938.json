The investor knows nothing about the claim other than its probability distribution, hence an ``intractable claim''. In view of the lack of necessary information about the claim, we consider a robust formulation to maximize her utility in the worst scenario. We apply the quantile formulation to solve the problem, expressing the quantile function of the optimal terminal investment income as the solution of certain variational inequalities of ordinary differential equations. In the case of an exponential utility, the problem reduces to a (non-robust) rank--dependent utility maximization with probability distortion whose solution is available in the literature.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一类连续时间下的效用最大化问题，其中投资者在到期时收到了金融市场投资回报以及某个未知概率分布的会计普通股价值，即所谓的“无法计算索赔”。因为缺乏关于索赔的信息，我们采用鲁棒性方法来最大化投资者在最坏情况下的效用。我们利用分位数公式来解决该问题，并将最优终端投资收入的分位函数表示为某些普通微分方程变分不等式的解。对于指数效用来说，该问题简化为具有概率扭曲的（非鲁棒性）排名依赖效用最大化问题，其解在文献中已有。",
