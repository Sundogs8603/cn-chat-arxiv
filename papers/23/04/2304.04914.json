    "abstract": "Appropriately regulating artificial intelligence is an increasingly urgent policy challenge. Legislatures and regulators lack the specialized knowledge required to best translate public demands into legal requirements. Overreliance on industry self-regulation fails to hold producers and users of AI systems accountable to democratic demands. Regulatory markets, in which governments require the targets of regulation to purchase regulatory services from a private regulator, are proposed. This approach to AI regulation could overcome the limitations of both command-and-control regulation and self-regulation. Regulatory market could enable governments to establish policy priorities for the regulation of AI, whilst relying on market forces and industry R&D efforts to pioneer the methods of regulation that best achieve policymakers' stated objectives.",

    "translated_abstract": "恰当地监管人工智能是一个日益紧迫的政策挑战。立法机构和监管机构缺乏翻译公众需求为法律要求所需的专业知识。过度依赖行业自律未能使AI系统的生产者和使用者对民主要求负责。提出了监管市场的概念，即政府要求受监管对象从私人监管机构购买监管服务。这种方法可以克服命令和控制监管和自我监管的局限性。监管市场可以使政府为AI监管建立政策优先级，同时依靠市场力量和行业研发努力来开创最能实现政策制定者声明目标的监管方法。",
