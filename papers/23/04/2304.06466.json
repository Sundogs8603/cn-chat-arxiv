The market-based statistics of \"actual\" returns takes into account the size of the trade sale values, purchased values and volumes of stocks and that differs it from conventional regular statistics based on frequency analysis of returns time-series.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了针对投资者市场销售中获得的“实际”收益的三个层次的市场统计量的统一理论描述。这些市场统计量考虑了交易销售价值的大小、购买价值和股票数量，与基于收益时间序列频率分析的传统常规统计学不同。我们首先描述了投资者通过过去的多次购买获得单次销售的统计收益率。第二个层次描述了投资者在“交易日”进行多次市场销售时获得的收益统计。第三个层次描述了在“交易日”期间不同投资者获得的收益统计。我们推导出收益的统计量对市场销售价值、购买价值和股票数量的统计量的依赖关系。反过来，交易价值和购买量的统计量取决于统计收益率的统计量。",
