    "abstract": "Understanding how proteins structurally interact is crucial to modern biology, with applications in drug discovery and protein design. Recent machine learning methods have formulated protein-small molecule docking as a generative problem with significant performance boosts over both traditional and deep learning baselines. In this work, we propose a similar approach for rigid protein-protein docking: DiffDock-PP is a diffusion generative model that learns to translate and rotate unbound protein structures into their bound conformations. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on DIPS with a median C-RMSD of 4.85, outperforming all considered baselines. Additionally, DiffDock-PP is faster than all search-based methods and generates reliable confidence estimates for its predictions.

    "translated_abstract": "了解蛋白质结构之间的相互作用对于现代生物学至关重要，在药物发现和蛋白质设计中有广泛应用。本文提出了一种类似的方法，用于刚性蛋白质-蛋白质对接：DiffDock-PP是一种扩散生成模型，它学习将不结合的蛋白质结构转化和旋转为它们结合的构象。我们在DIPS任务中实现了最先进的性能，中位数C-RMSD为4.85，优于所有考虑的基线方法。此外，DiffDock-PP比所有基于搜索的方法都要快，并为其预测生成可靠的置信度估计。我们的代码可在 $\\texttt{https://github.com/ketatam/DiffDock-PP}$ 上公开获得。",
