    "translated_abstract": "在小数据环境下应用机器学习时，数据增强是必不可少的。它可以生成新样本，遵循观测到的数据分布，同时增加它们的多样性和变异性，帮助研究人员和从业人员改善他们的模型的稳健性，并将其部署到实际世界中。然而，在表格数据中使用它仍有待改进，因为很少考虑到底层数据机制的先验知识，从而限制了生成数据的准确性和多样性。因果数据增强策略被认为是解决这些问题的一种方法，它依靠因果图中编码的条件独立性。在这个框架下，本文实验性地分析了ADMG因果增强方法并考虑了不同的设置，以支持研究人员和从业人员了解在哪些条件下先验知识有助于生成新的数据点，并因此增强他们的模型的稳健性。结果表明，基于ADMG的因果数据增强确实可以在已知因果关系的情况下提高模型性能，但如果不合适地使用，它也可能对模型产生负面影响。",
