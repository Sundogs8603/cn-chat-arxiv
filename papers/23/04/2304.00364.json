    "abstract": "Although pair trading is the simplest hedging strategy for an investor to eliminate market risk, it is still a great challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) methods to perform pair trading as human expertise. It requires RL methods to make thousands of correct actions that nevertheless have no obvious relations to the overall trading profit, and to reason over infinite states of the time-varying market most of which have never appeared in history. However, existing RL methods ignore the temporal connections between asset price movements and the risk of the performed trading. These lead to frequent tradings with high transaction costs and potential losses, which barely reach the human expertise level of trading. Therefore, we introduce CREDIT, a risk-aware agent capable of learning to exploit long-term trading opportunities in pair trading similar to a human expert. CREDIT is the first to apply bidirectional GRU along with the temporal attention mechanism to fully consider the tempora",
