    "translated_abstract": "遗传算法是一类黑盒优化算法，受到生物进化原理的启发而来。虽然它们提供了一种通用的优化工具，但它们的特定实例可能是启发式的，并受到松散的生物直觉的影响。在这项工作中，我们探索了一种根本不同的方法：在给定足够灵活的遗传算子参数化的情况下，我们以数据驱动的方式发现全新的遗传算法。更具体地，我们将选择和变异率自适应参数化为交叉和自注意模块，并使用元黑盒优化来演化它们在一组不同的优化任务上的参数。所得到的学习遗传算法优于最先进的自适应基线遗传算法，并且远远超出了元训练设置。学习到的算法可以应用于先前未见过的优化问题、搜索维度和评估预算。我们注释其决策过程，并展示它通常选择少量高度适应的变体，并通过其学习的注意机制来适应其搜索策略。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new data-driven method for discovering attention-based genetic algorithms via meta-black-box optimization. The resulting learned genetic algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art adaptive baseline algorithms and can be applied to previously unseen optimization problems. The algorithm typically selects a small number of highly fit variants and adapts its search strategy via its learned attention mechanism."
