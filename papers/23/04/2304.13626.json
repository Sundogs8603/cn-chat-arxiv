    "abstract": "We propose that symbols are first and foremost external communication tools used between intelligent agents that allow knowledge to be transferred in a more efficient and effective manner than having to experience the world directly. But, they are also used internally within an agent through a form of self-communication to help formulate, describe and justify subsymbolic patterns of neural activity that truly implement thinking. Symbols, and our languages that make use of them, not only allow us to explain our thinking to others and ourselves, but also provide beneficial constraints (inductive bias) on learning about the world. In this paper we present relevant insights from neuroscience and cognitive science, about how the human brain represents symbols and the concepts they refer to, and how today's artificial neural networks can do the same. We then present a novel neuro-symbolic hypothesis and a plausible architecture for intelligent agents that combines subsymbolic representations",

    "translated_title": "基于神经网络的人工智能中符号的作用：它们并不是你认为的那样！",
    "translated_abstract": "我们提出符号首先是智能体之间进行知识传递的外部沟通工具，比起直接经验世界，使用符号可以更加高效和有效。但符号也可以在智能体内部通过自我沟通的形式使用，来帮助描述和证明真正实施思考的次符号模式的神经活动。符号和使用符号的语言不仅允许我们向自己和他人阐述我们的思维，还为学习世界提供有益的约束（引导偏差）。在本文中，我们从神经科学和认知科学中提出了相关的见解，介绍了人类大脑如何表示符号及其所指的概念，以及现代人工神经网络如何实现相同的功能。接着提出一个新的神经符号假设和可能的智能体架构，结合了次符号表示和符号表示。",
    "tldr": "符号在基于神经网络的人工智能中并不只用于代表某个概念，还可作为外部和内部的沟通工具，提高知识传递效率，并对学习世界提供有益约束。",

This paper proposes a neuro-symbolic hypothesis and architecture that combines subsymbolic and symbolic representations."
