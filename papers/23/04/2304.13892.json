    "translated_abstract": "深度强化学习展现了从高维输入中提取有用表示的显著进展，尽管使用的是手工辅助任务和伪奖励。自动化地以物体为中心学习此类表示，以期实现控制和快速适应，仍然是一个未解决的研究问题。在本文中，我们介绍了一种方法，试图从物体中发现有意义的特征，将它们转化为时间上连贯的“问题”函数，并利用随后学习的广义值函数来进行控制。我们将我们的方法与最先进的技术进行比较，并展示了在静态和非静态设置下的竞争性表现。最后，我们还调查了被发现的广义值函数，并通过定性分析表明，学到的表示不仅是可解释的，而且围绕着物体，这些物体对任务的变化具有不变性，有助于快速适应。",
