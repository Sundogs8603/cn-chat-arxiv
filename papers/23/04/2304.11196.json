    "translated_abstract": "多任务学习已经被证明可以显著提高深度学习驱动的视觉系统在机器人抓取方面的性能。然而，高架构和计算复杂度可能导致在实际制造和仓库环境中通常用于机器人手臂的嵌入式设备上部署效果较差。因此，设计高效的、针对边缘计算机器人抓取的计算机视觉任务定制的多任务深度神经网络架构对于在制造环境中的广泛应用非常必要。为此，我们提出了快速GraspNeXt，一种针对嵌入式多任务学习的快速自注意神经网络架构，用于计算机视觉任务的机器人抓取。通过采用一个基于生成网络架构搜索策略和一组用于实现多任务学习性能和计算效率高度平衡的架构约束，我们构建了快速GraspNeXt。我们的实验结果表明，当在边缘设备上进行评估时，快速GraspNeXt在精度和速度方面均优于目前的最先进方法。",
