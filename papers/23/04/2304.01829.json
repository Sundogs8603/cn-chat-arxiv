    "translated_abstract": "垂直联邦学习（VFL）是一种有前途的联邦学习范畴，适用于数据垂直分区并分布在各方之间的情况。VFL使用来自不同方的特征来丰富样本描述，以提高模型容量。与水平联邦学习相比，在大多数情况下，VFL应用于公司的商业合作场景中，因此VFL包含巨大的商业价值。在过去的几年中，VFL在学术界和工业界引起了越来越多的关注。本文从分层视角系统地调查了VFL的现有研究工作。从硬件层到垂直联邦系统层，研究人员贡献了VFL的各个方面。此外，VFL的应用已覆盖了广泛的领域，例如金融、医疗等。在每个层面上，我们对现有工作进行分类并探讨了进一步研究和发展VFL的挑战。特别关注隐私保护，这是VFL中由于数据分布在各方之间而具有关键性的问题。",
