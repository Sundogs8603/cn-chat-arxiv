One popular method is to prune the connections based on a certain metric, but it is not entirely clear what metric is the best choice. Recent advances in neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory suggest that the training dynamics of large enough neural networks is closely related to the spectrum of the NTK. Motivated by this finding, we propose to prune the connections that have the least influence on the spectrum of the NTK. This method can help maintain the NTK spectrum, which may help align the training dynamics to that of its dense counterpart. However, one possible issue is that the fixed-weight-NTK corresponding to a given initial point can be very different from the NTK corresponding to later iterates during the training phase. We further propose to sample multiple realizations of random weights to estimate the NTK spectrum. Note that our approach is weight",

    "translated_abstract": "在训练之前剪枝神经网络因其减少训练时间和存储空间的潜力而受到越来越多的关注。其中一种流行的方法是基于某种度量对连接进行剪枝，但是什么度量是最好的选择还不完全清楚。神经切向核（NTK）理论的最新进展表明，足够大的神经网络的训练动态与NTK的频谱密切相关。在此发现的基础上，我们建议剪枝那些对NTK频谱影响最小的连接。这种方法有助于维持NTK频谱，这可能有助于将训练动态与其密集对应物的训练动态对齐。然而，一个可能的问题是给定初始点对应的固定权值NTK可能与训练阶段后的迭代对应的NTK非常不同。我们进一步提议对随机权重的多个实现进行采样以估计NTK频谱。请注意，我们的方法是权重无关的。",
