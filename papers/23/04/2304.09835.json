    "translated_abstract": "风力涡轮机功率曲线模型将环境条件转化为涡轮机的功率输出。它们对于能量产出预测和涡轮机性能监测至关重要。近年来，基于数据驱动的机器学习方法已经优于基于参数和物理知识的方法。然而，它们常常被批评为是不透明的“黑匣子”，这引起了人们对于它们在非稳态环境下的稳健性的担忧，例如风力涡轮机所面临的情况。因此，我们引入了可解释的人工智能（XAI）框架，根据运行中的SCADA数据来研究和验证数据驱动的功率曲线模型所学习的策略。它将领域特定的考虑与Shapley值和最新的XAI回归研究结果相结合。我们的结果表明，学习到的策略可以更好地指示模型的稳健性，而不是验证或测试集的误差。此外，我们观察到，高度复杂，最先进的机器学习模型很容易学习到物理上不合理的策略，这一点应引起注意。",
