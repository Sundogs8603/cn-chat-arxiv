    "translated_abstract": "季节趋势分解是时间序列分析中最基本的概念之一，它支持包括时间序列异常检测和预测在内的各种下游任务。然而，现有的分解方法依赖于批处理，时间复杂度为O(W)，其中W是时间窗口内的数据点数。因此，它们不能始终有效地支持需要低处理延迟的实时分析。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了OneShotSTL，这是一种高效和准确的算法，可以在线上对时间序列进行分解，更新时间复杂度为O(1)。OneShotSTL比批处理方法快10倍以上，精度与最佳对手相当。广泛的实验在下游时间序列异常检测和预测任务的真实基准数据集上表明，OneShotSTL比现有技术快10倍以上，同时仍提供相当甚至更好的精度。",
