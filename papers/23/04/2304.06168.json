    "translated_abstract": "随着越来越多的联网设备在物联网中实现，并期望在实时收集和处理数据，处理时间序列数据的能力变得日益重要。许多时间序列表示方法已被提出以帮助在数据挖掘应用程序中分析时间序列，但现有方法不适用于开放式时间序列，因为这些方法需要提前知道目标时间序列的总长度，并使用归一化方法对整个序列进行预处理。此外，许多表示方法需要用户预先配置和调整某些参数以获得满意的表示结果。在本文中，我们提出了一种实时的非归一化、免参数调节的开放式时间序列表示方法NP-Free。我们采用了新颖的技术，适应性地处理未知的数据长度并动态调整每个数据点的权重，而不使用任何归一化或参数调节。 我们的方法在多个时间序列分类任务中实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了实时处理速度。",
