The lack of due diligence protocol in the CBAA confers an undue comparative advantage to coal development, which is inconsistent with India's stance to phase down coal use, reduce air pollution, and advance modern sources of energy. We argue that the premise under which the CBAA was historically justified is no longer valid due to a significant change in the local context.

    "translated_abstract": "管理土地收购的法律可能会锁定旧的范例。我们研究了一个这样的例子，即1957年的煤炭领域法案（CBAA），它提供了最少的社会和环境保护，与2013年公平补偿和土地收购透明度法（LARR）存在重要差异。CBAA缺乏尽职调查协议，使得煤炭开发具有不当的比较优势，这与印度主张逐步减少煤炭使用、降低空气污染、推进现代能源的立场不一致。我们认为，历史上CBAA被证明是合理的前提已不再有效，因为当地环境和社会成本更加显著，市场上有更为清洁的能源替代品，成本具有竞争力。我们建议更新土地收购法律，将煤炭纳入LARR的总体监管范围，或至少修改CBAA以便建立更透明的程序来保证社会和环境保护。",

The authors recommend updating land acquisition laws to increase transparency and protect the environment."
