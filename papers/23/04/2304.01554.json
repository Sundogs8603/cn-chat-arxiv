    "translated_abstract": "无监督域自适应（UDA）解决了标记源域和未标记目标域之间分布差异的问题。虽然单目标域自适应（STDA）已经在2D和3D视觉文献中得到了广泛研究，但是在3D数据的多目标域自适应（MTDA）方面几乎没有得到研究。本文提出了一种名为\\emph{{\\bf M}ixup {\\bf Ens}emble {\\bf A}verage}或简称{\\bf \\emph{MEnsA}}的混合集成平均方法，将所有领域的特征表示混合在一起，以实现更好的域自适应性能的MTDA基线。通过混合表示，我们使用域分类器在共享的潜在空间中提高了源域特征表示与目标域特征表示的区分能力。在具有挑战性的PointDA-10数据集上进行了大量实验验证。",
