    "translated_abstract": "物理模拟是计算机辅助设计(CAD)优化过程中的一个计算瓶颈。因此，为了使精确(计算昂贵)的模拟可用于设计优化中，需要一个高样本效率的优化框架或快速的数据驱动代理(代理模型)来代替长时间运行的模拟。在这项工作中，我们利用最近优化和人工智能(AI)的进展来解决这两个潜在的解决方案，以设计一个最佳的无人水下航行器(UUV)。我们首先研究并比较了不同优化技术在优化循环中与标准计算流体力学(CFD)求解器相结合时的样本效率和收敛行为。然后，我们开发了一个基于深度神经网络(DNN)的代理模型来逼近否则通过CFD求解器进行计算的阻力。代理模型进而用于样本高效的优化框架中，该框架在不使用代理模型的情况下优于标准优化方法。",
