    "translated_abstract": "外在数据被认为在提高预测准确性方面起着关键作用。针对恰当的选择，全面的相关性分析是一个基本的第一步，从外在数据与参考时间序列的相似性开始。受现有时间序列相似性指标的启发，我们介绍了一种名为FARM（前向角相关度量）的新方法，能够有效地处理实时数据流。我们的前向方法依赖于一种角度特征，该特征利用后续数据点的变化比较来对齐经过时间变形的序列。所提出的算法结合了本地和全局指标，提供了一个平衡的相关性度量。这导致将部分、中间匹配也视为外在数据序列重要指标的考虑因素。作为第一步验证，我们介绍了我们的FARM方法对合成但具有代表性的信号和真实世界时间序列记录的应用。同时展示了FARM方法提高了预测准确度的结果。",
