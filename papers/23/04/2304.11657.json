    "translated_abstract": "通过逐步引导思维链 (CoT) 作为示范，大型语言模型 (LLMs) 可以在各种推理任务上实现高度有效的性能。然而，LLMs 生成的演示推理链容易出现错误，这可能会导致推理过程中的错误。此外，不恰当的示例 (过于简单或复杂) 可以影响在不同难度级别下的整体性能。我们引入了Iter-CoT (迭代引导思维链提示) 的迭代引导方法，用于选择实例并生成推理链。通过利用迭代增强，我们的方法使LLMs 自主更正错误，从而产生更精确、全面的推理链。同时，我们的方法选择具有适度难度的具有挑战性但可回答的问题，并伴随推理链作为示例，从而增强LLMs 的泛化能力。",
