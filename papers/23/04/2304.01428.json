    "translated_abstract": "近年来，对无人机在拥挤动态的共享空间中进行自主操作的需求迅速增长，因此需要开发可信的代理程序以实现无缝安全导航。本文提出了Social Robot Tree Search (SoRTS)，一种用于在社交领域中移动机器人安全导航的算法。SoRTS旨在通过Monte Carlo Tree Search规划器增强现有的社交感知轨迹预测策略，以实现更好的移动机器人下游导航效果。为了评估我们方法的性能，我们选择了一般航空领域的社交导航应用。为了促进这一评估，我们还引入了高保真度的X-Plane ROS（机载操作系统）飞行模拟器，以实现在完全自主操作上的更多研究。通过对26名FAA认证飞行员的行业评估，我们证明了SoRTS的表现与一名熟练的人类飞行员相当，明显优于我们的基准算法。我们进一步补充了这些结果。",
