    "translated_abstract": "基于连续脑电图（cEEG）的视觉光谱表示具有广泛的应用于诊断癫痫的病人无关的癫痫活动检测，但由于受到受试者、通道和时间点之间微妙变异的影响，精确检测仍然是一个巨大的挑战。因此，捕捉细粒度、有辨别力的EEG模式特征，尤其是与高频纹理信息相关的特征，仍然需要解决。在本文中，我们提出了Scattering Transformer（ScatterFormer），一种基于不变散射变换的层级Transformer，专门关注微妙的特征。特别地，我们提出了解耦的频率感知注意力（FAA）来捕捉临床有信息量的高频成分，提供基于多通道EEG信号的视觉编码的新型临床可解释性。对癫痫形放电检测的两个不同任务的评估证明了我们方法的有效性。",
