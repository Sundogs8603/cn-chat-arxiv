    "translated_abstract": "花卉品种检测并给出品种详细信息，包括栽培过程和照顾方式，对于花卉栽培、品种发明和花卉业务非常重要。在孟加拉国所有的本地花卉中，玫瑰是最受欢迎和需求量最大的花卉之一。玫瑰不仅在孟加拉国，而且在世界范围内都是最受欢迎的花卉之一。玫瑰除了用于装饰外，还可以用于许多其他用途。由于玫瑰在花卉行业具有巨大的需求，因此玫瑰品种检测非常重要。然而，与不同花卉的分类不同，目前没有关于特定花卉品种检测的显著工作。本研究提出了一种使用迁移学习技术从图像中检测玫瑰品种的模型。对于花卉方面的这项工作，图像处理和分类的资源不足，因此我们需要大量的图像数据来训练模型。我们使用了1939张不同玫瑰品种的原始图像。我们提出的模型在检测六种不同品种的玫瑰方面获得了97.89％的准确度。该模型可以大大帮助花卉行业识别和栽培不同品种的玫瑰，并为每个品种提出最佳的栽培和照顾实践。",
