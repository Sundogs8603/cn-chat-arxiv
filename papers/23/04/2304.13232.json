    "abstract": "Hardware Trojans (HTs) are undesired design or manufacturing modifications that can severely alter the security and functionality of digital integrated circuits. HTs can be inserted according to various design criteria, e.g., nets switching activity, observability, controllability, etc. However, to our knowledge, most HT detection methods are only based on a single criterion, i.e., nets switching activity. This paper proposes a multi-criteria reinforcement learning (RL) HT detection tool that features a tunable reward function for different HT detection scenarios. The tool allows for exploring existing detection strategies and can adapt new detection scenarios with minimal effort. We also propose a generic methodology for comparing HT detection methods fairly. Our preliminary results show an average of 84.2% successful HT detection in ISCAS-85 benchmark",

    "translated_abstract": "硬件特洛伊（HT）是一种不受欢迎的设计或制造修改，会严重影响数字集成电路的安全性和功能。HT可以根据各种设计准则插入，例如，网络切换活动，可观测性，可控性等。然而，据我们所知，大多数HT检测方法只基于单一标准，即网络切换活动。本文提出了一种多准则强化学习（RL）HT检测工具，该工具具有可调节的奖励函数，可用于不同的HT检测场景。该工具允许探索现有的检测策略，并可以以最小的努力适应新的检测场景。我们还提出了一种公正比较HT检测方法的通用方法。我们的初步结果显示ISCAS-85基准测试中84.2％的HT检测成功。",
