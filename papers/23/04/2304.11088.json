In this paper, we utilize semantic knowledge through the inference-based model COMET and sentiments of news headlines for barrier classification. We consider five barriers including cultural, economic, political, linguistic, and geographical, and different types of news headlines including health, sports, science, recreation, games, homes, society, shopping, computers, and business. To that end, we collect and label the news headlines automatically for the barriers using the metadata of news publishers.

    "translated_abstract": "新闻标题可以是检测新闻媒体中新闻传播障碍的好数据源，在许多实际应用中非常有用。本文利用基于推理的模型COMET的语义知识和新闻标题的情感特征来对障碍进行分类。我们考虑了文化、经济、政治、语言和地理等五种障碍，以及包括健康、运动、科学、娱乐、游戏、住房、社会、购物、计算机和商业等不同类型的新闻标题。为此，我们利用新闻出版商的元数据自动收集和标记新闻标题，以此来检测新闻传播障碍。我们将我们的方法与传统的文本分类方法、深度学习和基于transformer的方法进行了比较。结果表明，利用推理为基础的语义知识和情感特征的方法可以有效地检测新闻传播障碍。",
