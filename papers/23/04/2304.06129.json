    "translated_abstract": "概念瓶颈模型(CBM)是一种创建更易解释的神经网络的流行方法，其采用隐藏层神经元对应于人类可理解的概念。然而，现有的CBM及其变体存在两个关键限制：首先，它们需要为每个预定义的概念收集标记数据，这是耗时且劳动密集的；其次，在更复杂的数据集上，CBM的准确性通常明显低于标准神经网络的准确性，这样的表现为其在实际世界应用中造成一定的障碍。鉴于这些挑战，我们提出了无标签CBM，它是一种将任何神经网络转换为可解释CBM的新框架，无需标记概念数据，同时保持高准确性。我们的无标签CBM有许多优点，它是可扩展的——我们提出了第一个可扩展到ImageNet的CBM，高效的——即使对于非常大的数据集，创建CBM仅需要几个小时，而且可以自动化进行，不需要人类干预。",
