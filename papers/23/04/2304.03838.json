    "translated_abstract": "虽然深度学习模型在许多任务中取得了成功，但人们仍然担心这些模型可能学习到快捷方式，并且缺乏对无关混淆因素的鲁棒性。在直接训练于人脸上的模型中，一个敏感的混淆因素是人的身份。许多与人脸相关的任务理想情况下应该是与身份无关的，并在不同个体之间表现一致（即公平）。通过在训练期间强制执行这种鲁棒性和性能均匀性是度量和实施的一种方法，假设可以在规模上获取与身份相关的信息。但是，由于隐私问题以及收集此类信息的成本，这通常不是情况，大多数人脸数据集只包含输入图像及其相应的任务标签。因此，无需此类注释即可提高身份相关鲁棒性非常重要。在这里，我们探讨使用人脸识别嵌入向量作为身份标识的替代方法，以执行这种鲁棒性和公平性。",
