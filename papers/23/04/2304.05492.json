    "translated_abstract": "串联推荐模型是一种通过学习用户与物品间的时间顺序互动来进行推荐的模型，其已经在许多领域中展现出了良好的表现。然而，近期串联推荐模型的鲁棒性备受质疑。这种模型的两个特性使其容易受到攻击 - 在训练中会产生级联效应，在模型过度依赖时间信息的同时会忽略其他特征。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种针对串联推荐模型的级联指导下的对抗训练的方法。我们的方法利用串联建模中的内在级联效应，在训练过程中产生战略性的对抗性扰动来影响物品嵌入。在使用不同的公共数据集训练四种最先进的串联模型实验中，我们的训练方法产生了比现有方法更高的模型鲁棒性，并获得了更好的性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a cascade-guided adversarial training method to improve the robustness and accuracy of sequential recommendation models, which outperform traditional models but have vulnerabilities due to cascading effects and over-reliance on temporal information. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves better results than existing methods on four public datasets."
