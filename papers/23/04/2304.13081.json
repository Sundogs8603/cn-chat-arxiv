    "translated_abstract": "私营和公共部门的结构和规范精细化了新兴技术的实际应用。在医疗保健中，尽管出现了大量的AI采用方式，但是其使用和整合周围的组织治理往往被认为不可行。健康AI合作伙伴关系（HAIP）旨在通过此研究更好地定义医疗保健中AI系统的充分组织治理要求，并支持卫生系统领导人做出更加明智的决策。要达到这个目标，我们首先确定了AI在医疗保健中采用的标准如何易于使用和高效运作。然后，我们在特定的卫生系统中，绘制出实际机构采用AI技术的具体决策点。在实践中，我们通过与美国主要医疗保健系统的领导人和相关领域的主要知情人合作，实现了这一目标。通过这种合作，我们制定了AI在医疗保健中的组织治理框架，其中包括关键控制点和决策标准。",
