    "abstract": "In this study, Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk's works are chosen as examples of Turkish literature. By counting the number of letters and words in his texts, we find it possible to study his works statistically. It has been known that there is a geometrical order in text structures. Here the method based on the basic assumption of fractal geometry is introduced for calculating the fractal dimensions of Pamuk's texts. The results are compared with the applications of Zipf's law, which is successfully applied for letters and words, where two concepts, namely Zipf's dimension and Zipf's order, are introduced. The Zipf dimension of the novel My Name is Red is found to be much different than his other novels. However, it is linguistically observed that there is no fundamental difference between his corpora. The results are interpreted in terms of fractal dimensions and the Turkish language.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究选择了诺贝尔文学奖得主奥尔罕·帕慕克的著作作为土耳其文学的例子。通过计算他的文本中字母和单词的数量，我们发现可以进行统计学研究。已知文本结构中存在几何顺序。这里介绍了基于分形几何基本假设的方法，用于计算帕姆克文本的分形维度。结果与应用于字母和单词的Zipf定律的应用进行比较，引入了两个概念，即Zipf维度和Zipf顺序。发现小说《我的名字叫红》的Zipf维度与他的其他小说有很大的不同。然而，从语言学角度观察，他的语料库之间并没有根本的区别。结果以分形维度和土耳其语言的角度进行了解释。",
