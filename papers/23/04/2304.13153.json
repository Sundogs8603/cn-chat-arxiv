    "abstract": "Unsupervised learning of 3D human faces from unstructured 2D image data is an active research area. While recent works have achieved an impressive level of photorealism, they commonly lack control of lighting, which prevents the generated assets from being deployed in novel environments. To this end, we introduce LumiGAN, an unconditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for 3D human faces with a physically based lighting module that enables relighting under novel illumination at inference time. Unlike prior work, LumiGAN can create realistic shadow effects using an efficient visibility formulation that is learned in a self-supervised manner. LumiGAN generates plausible physical properties for relightable faces, including surface normals, diffuse albedo, and specular tint without any ground truth data. In addition to relightability, we demonstrate significantly improved geometry generation compared to state-of-the-art non-relightable 3D GANs and notably better photorealism than exi",

    "translated_abstract": "从非结构化的二维图像数据中无监督地学习三维人脸是一个活跃的研究领域。尽管最近的研究已经实现了令人印象深刻的逼真度，但它们通常缺乏对照明的控制，这样生成的模型就无法在新环境中使用。为此，我们介绍了LumiGAN，一种无条件的生成对抗网络（GAN）用于生成三维人脸，并带有一个基于物理学的照明模块，该模块可以在推理时实现在新的光照下的再照明。与以往的工作不同，LumiGAN可以使用一种在自监督学习中学习的高效可见性公式来产生逼真的阴影效果。LumiGAN可以生成可再照明的人脸的逼真物理特性，包括表面法线、漫反射反照率和高光色调，而无需任何ground truth数据。除了可再照明性之外，我们还展示了与最先进的不可再照明的三维GAN相比，显著改进的几何生成，并且比现有的可再照明方法具有明显更好的逼真度。",
