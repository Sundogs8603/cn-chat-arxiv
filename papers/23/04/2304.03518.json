    "abstract": "This paper describes our submission to Task 10 at SemEval 2023-Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS), divided into three subtasks. The recent rise in social media platforms has seen an increase in disproportionate levels of sexism experienced by women on social media platforms. This has made detecting and explaining online sexist content more important than ever to make social media safer and more accessible for women. Our approach consists of experimenting and finetuning BERT-based models and using a Majority Voting ensemble model that outperforms individual baseline model scores. Our system achieves a macro F1 score of 0.8392 for Task A, 0.6092 for Task B, and 0.4319 for Task C.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文描述了我们在SemEval 2023任务10中提交的作品-可解释的在线性别歧视检测（EDOS），分为三个子任务。社交媒体平台的不断增长导致女性在社交媒体平台上面临不成比例的性别歧视。这使得检测和解释在线性别歧视内容变得比以往更加重要，以使社交媒体对女性更加安全和可访问。我们的方法包括实验和微调基于BERT的模型，并使用多数投票集合模型，该模型优于单个基线模型得分。我们的系统在任务A中实现了宏F1分数0.8392，在任务B中为0.6092，在任务C中为0.4319。",
