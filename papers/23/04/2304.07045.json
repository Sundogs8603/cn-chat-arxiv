The empirical covariance estimator fails when dimension and number of samples are proportional and tend to infinity, settings known as Kolmogorov asymptotics. When the mean is known, Ledoit and Wolf (2004) proposed a linear shrinkage estimator and proved its convergence under those asymptotics. To the best of our knowledge, no formal proof has been proposed when the mean is unknown. To address this issue, we propose a new estimator and prove its quadratic convergence under the Ledoit and Wolf assumptions. Finally, we show empirically that it outperforms other standard estimators.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了在未知均值下的大维协方差矩阵估计问题。当维数和样本数成比例并趋向于无穷大时，经验协方差估计器失效，此时称为Kolmogorov渐进性。当均值已知时，Ledoit和Wolf（2004）提出了一个线性收缩估计器，并证明了在这些演进下的收敛性。据我们所知，当均值未知时，尚未提出正式证明。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新的估计器，并在Ledoit和Wolf的假设下证明了它的二次收敛性。最后，我们通过实验证明它胜过了其他标准估计器。",
