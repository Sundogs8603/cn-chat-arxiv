To rule out moral hazard issues, we only consider moral-hazard-free reinsurance contracts by imposing the incentive compatibility constraint on indemnity functions.

We first show that an optimal reinsurance contract always exists and then derive two sufficient and necessary conditions to characterize it. Due to the presence of the incentive compatibility constraint and the nonconcavity of the distortion, the optimal contract is obtained as a solution to a double obstacle problem.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了扩散风险模型下的最优再保险问题，保险人的目标是尽量减少破产的可能性。为了避免道德风险问题，我们仅考虑无道德风险再保险合同，并在保障功能上施加激励兼容性约束。再保险保费是在扩展的畸变保费原则下计算的，其中畸变函数不一定是凸的。我们首先表明，最优再保险合同总是存在的，然后得出了两个充分必要条件来表征它。由于激励兼容性约束和畸变函数的非凸性，最优合同是通过解决双障碍问题获得的。最后，我们将所得到的一般结果应用于三个示例的研究，并以（半）封闭形式获得最优的合同。",
