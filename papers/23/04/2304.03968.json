    "translated_abstract": "量化已经成为在资源有限的设备上部署深度神经网络(DNNs)的重要技术。然而，在现实世界应用中，量化模型在受到各种噪声的影响时表现出脆弱性。尽管评估量化对鲁棒性的影响很重要，但是关于这个主题的现有研究有限且常常忽略了已经建立的鲁棒性评估原则，导致了不完整和无法下结论的研究结果。为了填补这一空白，我们在ImageNet上充分评估了量化模型对各种噪声(对抗攻击、自然扰动和系统噪声)的鲁棒性。广泛的实验表明，较低位的量化对抗攻击更具弹性，但更容易受到自然扰动和系统噪声的影响。值得注意的是，我们的研究发现，脉冲噪声(在自然扰动中)和最近邻插值(在系统噪声中)对量化模型的鲁棒性影响最大。",
