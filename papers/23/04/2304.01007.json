    "translated_abstract": "埃及老鼠夹纸牌游戏是一种现代的美国纸牌游戏，被全球数百万玩家喜爱。该游戏的目的是收集整副牌中所有的牌。通常情况下，最快的反应速度是获胜的关键，因为收集牌的最常见策略是成为第一个在中心堆中合法的牌组合放下时拍打堆的玩家。大多数玩家认为，主导策略是发展比对手更快的反应时间，而该假设并未受到学术研究的挑战。这篇论文探讨了一个“风险拍打”策略家的假设，他依赖实际的经济决策来战胜那些只依赖快速反应的玩家，从而在游戏中获得压倒性的胜利。理论上，这可以通过利用“烧牌规则”来实现，这是一种罚款规则，过于低廉，无法有效地阻止玩家非法地拍打牌堆而获益。我们使用Ruby编程语言构建了一款ERS模拟器，其中“风险拍打”策略在约85%的游戏中击败了快速反应策略。这支持了实践证明，经济决策制定可以成为ERS中一种有效的策略，博弈论可成为了解和改进游戏玩法的有价值工具。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the use of economic decision making in the \"risk slapping\" strategy to defeat opponents who rely solely on fast reflexes in the Egyptian Ratscrew card game. Using computational game theory, a simulation of the game was created where the risk slapping strategy won approximately 85% of games played, supporting the idea that game theory can be used to understand and improve gameplay."
