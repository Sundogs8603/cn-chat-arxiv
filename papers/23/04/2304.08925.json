First, we run experiments to test the performance implications of the two major data preprocessing methods using either raw data or record files. The preliminary results show that data preprocessing is a clear bottleneck, even with the most efficient software and hardware configuration enabled by NVIDIA DALI, a high-optimized data preprocessing library. Second, we identify the potential causes, exercise a variety of optimization methods, and present their pros and cons. We hope this work will shed light on the new co-design of ``data storage, loading pipeline'' and ``training framework'' and flexible resource configurations between them so that the resources can be fully exploited and performance can be maximized.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文主要关注公共云环境下DNN训练的数据预处理流程。我们首先进行实验测试，以测试使用原始数据或记录文件的两种主要数据预处理方法的性能影响。初步结果表明，即使启用了NVIDIA DALI（高度优化的数据预处理库）的最高效软件和硬件配置，数据预处理仍然是一个明显的瓶颈。其次，我们确定了潜在的原因，运用了各种优化方法，并提出了它们的优缺点。我们希望这项工作能为“数据存储、加载管道”和“训练框架”的新协同设计以及它们之间的灵活资源配置提供启示，以便充分利用资源并最大化性能。",
