    "translated_abstract": "点击率预测是在线广告和推荐中的基本任务之一。虽然多层感知器（MLP）在许多深度CTR预测模型中作为核心组件，但广为人知的是，仅应用一个基本MLP网络在学习乘法特征相互作用方面并不高效。因此，许多两个流交互模型（例如，DeepFM和DCN）通过将MLP网络与另一个专用网络集成以增强CTR预测。由于MLP流隐式地学习特征交互作用，因此现有研究主要关注于增强补充流中的显式特征交互作用。相反，我们的实证研究表明，一个经过良好调整的双流MLP模型，它只是简单地结合了两个MLP，甚至可以实现令人惊讶的良好性能，这在现有的工作中从未被报道过。基于这个观察结果，我们进一步提出了特征选择和交互聚合层。",
