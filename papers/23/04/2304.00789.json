    "translated_abstract": "随着电子商务的发展和客户对物流服务的要求增加，物流服务提供商在日常规划中面临新的复杂性，主要是由于有效地处理当天的配送。现有的多阶段随机优化方法允许解决底层的动态车辆路径问题，但要么计算成本在在线设置中太高，要么（在强化学习的情况下）难以在高维组合问题上表现良好。为了减轻这些缺点，我们提出了一种新颖的机器学习流程，其中包含了一个组合优化层。我们将这个通用流程应用于具有调度波的动态车辆路径问题，这个问题最近被推广到NeurIPS 2022的EURO meets NeurIPS车辆路径规划竞赛中。我们的方法在这个比赛中排名第一，超过了所有其他方法来解决所提出的动态车辆路径问题。通过这项工作，我们验证了基于组合优化增强的机器学习在动态车辆路径问题中的有效性。",
