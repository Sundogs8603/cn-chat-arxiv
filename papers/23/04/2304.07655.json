    "translated_abstract": "目前大多数脉冲神经网络（SNN）的训练依赖于归纳偏差，这并不一定适用于多个需要低延迟和功耗效率的关键任务。 基于相关的脑电图（EEG）信号推断大脑行为就是一个这样的例子，学习时空依赖关系会严重影响网络的训练和推断效率。目前，SNN仅仅依靠一般归纳偏差来模拟不同数据流之间的动态关系。在这里，我们提出了一种用于多通道 EEG 分类的图形脉冲神经网络架构（EEGSN），它能够学习分布在 EEG 传感器中的动态关系信息。与现有技术相比，我们的方法将推断计算复杂度降低了20倍，同时在运动执行分类任务上达到了可比较的准确性。总体而言，我们的工作为可解释和高效训练 EEG 数据的图形SNN提供了一个框架，从而实现了低延迟和功耗效率的脑-计算机界面的开发。",
