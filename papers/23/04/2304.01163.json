    "abstract": "Following initial work by Robbins, we rigorously present an extended theory of nonnegative supermartingales, requiring neither integrability nor finiteness. In particular, we derive a key maximal inequality foreshadowed by Robbins, which we call the extended Ville's inequality, that strengthens the classical Ville's inequality (for integrable nonnegative supermartingales), and also applies to our nonintegrable setting. We derive an extension of the method of mixtures, which applies to $\\sigma$-finite mixtures of our extended nonnegative supermartingales. We present some implications of our theory for sequential statistics, such as the use of improper mixtures (priors) in deriving nonparametric confidence sequences and (extended) e-processes.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文在 Robbins 的初始工作基础上，严密地提出了一种非负超马氏过程的扩展理论，不需要可积性或有限性。特别地，我们推导了 Robbins 预示的一个关键极大不等式，称为扩展维尔不等式，它加强了经典的维尔不等式（适用于可积非负超马氏过程），并适用于我们的非可积设置。我们推导了混合方法的扩展，适用于我们扩展的非负超马氏过程的 $\\sigma$- 有限混合。我们介绍了我们理论在顺序统计中的一些应用，如在推导非参数置信序列和（扩展）e-过程中使用不适当混合（先验）。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种新的理论来描述非负超马氏过程，并推导出一个新的极大不等式，适用于非可积情况，并说明了混合方法的扩展以及该理论在顺序统计中的应用。",
