    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，网络安全威胁和多样性的增加导致了漏洞报告和分析的增加。为了应对这一问题，许多非营利组织在这一领域崛起，如MITRE和OSWAP，他们一直在积极追踪漏洞，并以标准化格式发布防御建议。由于手动生产这种格式的数据非常耗时，因此一些提议试图自动化该过程。不幸的是，采用监督式机器学习解决此问题的一个重要障碍是缺乏公开的专业数据集。在此，我们旨在弥合这一差距。特别是，我们专注于将CVE记录映射到MITRE CWE弱点，并向研究社区发布了一个手动注释的数据集，其中包含4,012条记录。在考虑到人在循环框架的情况下，我们将问题视为排名任务，并旨在采用强化学习来利用其中。",
