    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，交叉领域推荐（CR）被广泛研究，通过利用不同领域的信息来缓解推荐系统中的数据稀疏问题。本文聚焦于更一般的非重叠交叉领域顺序推荐（NCSR）场景。NCSR具有挑战性，因为领域之间没有重叠的实体（例如用户和项目），只有用户的隐式反馈和没有内容信息。以前的CR方法无法很好地解决NCSR问题，因为他们要么需要额外的内容来对齐领域，要么需要显式的领域对齐约束来降低领域差异，要么更关注用户的显式反馈（即用户的评分数据），而无法很好地捕捉他们的顺序交互模式，他们通常只进行单目标的跨领域推荐任务，很少研究双目标的任务。考虑到上述挑战，本文提出了面向非重叠交叉领域顺序推荐的自动提示框架（PLNCSR），通过利用用户在源领域中的顺序交互模式，旨在提示（即推断）目标领域中用户和项目之间的缺失交互。此外，我们还设计了一种新颖的多任务学习机制，以联合优化跨领域推荐和提示推断目标。在两个真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，PLNCSR优于现有方法。",
