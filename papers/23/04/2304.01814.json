    "translated_abstract": "低剂量计算机断层扫描（CT）图像由于光子匮乏和电子噪声而受到噪声和伪影的影响。最近，一些研究尝试使用扩散模型来解决以前基于深度学习的去噪模型遇到的过度平滑和训练不稳定性问题。然而，由于涉及大量采样步骤，扩散模型的推理时间很长。最近，冷扩散模型推广了经典扩散模型，并具有更大的灵活性。受冷扩散的启发，本文提出了一种新颖的针对低剂量CT（LDCT）去噪的上下文误差调制广义扩散模型，称为CoreDiff。首先，CoreDiff利用LDCT图像来消除随机高斯噪声，并采用新型均值保持退化算子来模拟CT退化的物理过程，由于启动采样过程的信息丰富的LDCT图像，大幅减少采样步骤。其次，为缓解扩散模型中过多采样步骤的问题，引入上下文误差调制，使CoreDiff更具有鲁棒性和泛化能力。",
