    "abstract": "We describe our contribution to the SemEVAl 2023 AfriSenti-SemEval shared task, where we tackle the task of sentiment analysis in 14 different African languages. We develop both monolingual and multilingual models under a full supervised setting (subtasks A and B). We also develop models for the zero-shot setting (subtask C). Our approach involves experimenting with transfer learning using six language models, including further pertaining of some of these models as well as a final finetuning stage. Our best performing models achieve an F1-score of 70.36 on development data and an F1-score of 66.13 on test data. Unsurprisingly, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques for sentiment analysis across multiple languages. Our approach can be applied to other sentiment analysis tasks in different languages and domains.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们描述了我们在SemEval 2023 AfriSenti-SemEval共享任务中的贡献，其中我们解决了14种不同非洲语言的情感分析任务。我们在完全监督的条件下开发了单语和多语模型（子任务A和B）。我们还为零-shot设置（子任务C）开发了模型。我们的方法涉及使用六种语言模型进行转移学习的实验，包括一些模型的进一步调整以及最后的微调阶段。我们效果最好的模型在开发数据上实现了70.36的F1分数，在测试数据上实现了66.13的F1分数。我们的结果表明了跨多种语言的情感分析中，转移学习和微调技术的有效性。我们的方法可以应用于不同语言和领域的其他情感分析任务。",
