Since labeled datasets specific to exercising are rare, we propose a method that makes use of the abundance of fitness videos available online. Specifically, we utilize the advantage that videos often not only show the exercises, but also provide language as an additional source of information. With push-ups as an example, we show that through the analysis of subtitle data using natural language processing (NLP), it is possible to create a labeled (irrelevant, relevant correct, relevant incorrect) dataset containing relevant information for pose analysis. In particular, we show that irrelevant clips ($n=332$) have significantly different joint visibility values compared to relevant clips ($n=298$). Inspecting cluster centroids also show",

    "translated_abstract": "随着计算机视觉和机器学习技术的不断提升，基于视频的居家锻炼评估系统已成为目前研究的热门话题。然而，性能很大程度上取决于可用的训练数据量。由于专门针对运动的标记数据集很少，我们提出了一种利用在线健身视频丰富资源的方法。具体来说，我们利用视频通常不仅展示练习内容，还提供语言信息作为额外的信息源的优势。以俯卧撑为例，我们展示了通过NLP技术分析字幕数据，可以创建一个包含与姿势分析相关信息的标记数据集（无关紧要，相关正确，相关不正确）。特别地，我们展示了无关剪辑（$n=332$）具有与相关剪辑（$n=298$）显著不同的关节可见性值。检查聚类中心也展现了有用的信息。",
