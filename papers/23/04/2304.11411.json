    "translated_abstract": "在线电影评论平台为电影产业和公众提供众包反馈，但剧透评论严重损害了用户体验。尽管已经进行了初步的研究以自动识别剧透，但其仅关注于评论内容本身，而强大的剧透检测需要将评论放入关于电影的事实和知识、用户在电影评论平台上的行为等上下文中。因此，在我们首先整理了一个基于网络的剧透检测数据集LCS和一个全面的最新电影知识库UKM之后，我们提出了MVSD，一种考虑到有关电影和用户活动的外部知识的新型多视角剧透检测框架。具体而言，MVSD构建三个互联的异构信息网络来模拟多样化的数据来源及其多视图属性，而我们设计并采用了一种新型的异构图卷积神经网络（HGCN）来融合多视图嵌入并预测剧透。我们在LCS数据集上进行了广泛的实验，并展示了MVSD在准确性和F1得分方面显著优于强基线。此外，我们还在一个流行的电影评论网站上展示了MVSD在真实剧透识别任务上的功效。",

The framework outperforms strong baselines on the LCS dataset, showing promising results for real-world spoiler identification."
