    "abstract": "We study the convergence of message passing graph neural networks on random graph models to their continuous counterpart as the number of nodes tends to infinity. Until now, this convergence was only known for architectures with aggregation functions in the form of degree-normalized means. We extend such results to a very large class of aggregation functions, that encompasses all classically used message passing graph neural networks, such as attention-based mesage passing or max convolutional message passing on top of (degree-normalized) convolutional message passing. Under mild assumptions, we give non asymptotic bounds with high probability to quantify this convergence. Our main result is based on the McDiarmid inequality. Interestingly, we treat the case where the aggregation is a coordinate-wise maximum separately, at it necessitates a very different proof technique and yields a qualitatively different convergence rate.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了消息传递图神经网络在随机图模型上的收敛性，当节点数量趋近于无限时，该网络模型能收敛于其连续模型。迄今为止，该收敛性结果只适用于聚合函数采用度规范化平均值形式的网络结构。我们将此结果扩展到包含所有传统消息传递图神经网络的大类聚合函数上，例如基于注意力和最大卷积的网络。在一定假设下，我们给出了高概率的非渐进上限来量化这种收敛性。我们的主要结果基于McDiarmid不等式。有趣的是，我们特别处理了聚合函数采用逐个坐标最大值的情况，因为它需要非常不同的证明技巧，并产生了定性不同的收敛率。",
