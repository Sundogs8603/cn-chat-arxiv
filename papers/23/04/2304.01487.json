    "translated_abstract": "聊天GPT已经成为一种全球感知。随着聊天GPT和其他大型语言模型（LLM）的出现，对于他们的误用的担忧也增加了，例如传播虚假消息，抄袭，操纵公众舆论，欺骗和欺诈。因此，区分人工生成和AI生成的文本变得越来越重要。研究人员提出了各种检测方法，从基本的二元分类器到更复杂的深度学习模型。一些检测技术依赖于统计特征或句法模式，而其他一些则包含语义或上下文信息以提高准确性。本研究的主要目标是对聊天GPT检测中最新技术进行全面和现代化的评估。此外，我们还评估了其他未专门声称检测聊天GPT生成内容的AI生成文本检测工具以评估它们在检测聊天GPT生成内容方面的表现。在我们的评估中，我们使用了一个包含人工编写和聊天GPT生成的文本的大型数据集。",
