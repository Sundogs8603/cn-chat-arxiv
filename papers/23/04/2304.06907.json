    "translated_abstract": "在大多数图像检索系统中，图像包含各种高层语义，被称为标签或注释。几乎所有处理非均衡标记的最先进的图像注释方法都是基于搜索的技术，这些技术非常耗时。本文提出了一种新的耦合字典学习方法，同时学习有限数量的视觉原型和相应的语义，从而实现了实时图像注释过程。本文的另一个贡献是使用边缘损失函数，而不是对于不平衡标签的图像注释不合适的平方损失函数。在我们的方法中，我们使用了边缘化损失函数来利用一种简单有效的原型更新方法。同时，我们在语义原型上引入了${\\ell}_1$正则化，以保持学习语义原型中标签的稀疏不平衡性。最后，进行了全面的实验验证。",
