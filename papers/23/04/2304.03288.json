    "translated_abstract": "过去的十年中，深度学习的突破以及人工智能研究的快速发展引领了人工智能技术在几乎所有领域的应用。因此，技术和非技术端用户必须了解这些技术以利用它们。然而，现有的资料都是为专家设计的，但非技术用户需要能够以易于理解的步骤呈现复杂思想的吸引人材料。一个适合这种情况的工具是滚动叙述(scrollytelling），这是一种讲故事的方法，为读者提供一种自然且丰富的阅读体验，以读者的节奏和深入的交互式解释复杂的概念。因此，本文提出了一种新的可视化设计，用于创建一个可滚动讲述，可以有效地向非技术用户解释人工智能概念。作为我们设计的一个示例，我们创建了一个可滚动叙述，以解释孪生神经网络用于实现视觉相似性匹配问题的工作原理。我们的方法通过提供具有直观解释的交互式界面，有助于创建一个有价值的可视化效果来展示孪生神经网络的工作流程。",
