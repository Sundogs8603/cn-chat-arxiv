    "translated_abstract": "点云数据被广泛认为是城市制图最佳数据类型之一。因此，点云数据集通常被用于各种城市解释方法的基准类型。然而，很少有研究者探究使用点云基准来进行表面分割。稳健的表面分割已经成为各种应用的关键因素，范围从模拟自动驾驶功能到文化遗产保护。在本文中，我们提出了一种丰富现有点云数据集的方法，其中新增了面相关类别，以便于进行表面分割测试。我们提出了如何高效地扩展现有数据集，并全面评估它们在表面分割方面的潜力。我们使用该方法创建了TUM-FA\\c{C}ADE数据集，用于扩展TUM-MLS-2016的功能。TUM-FA\\c{C}ADE不仅可以促进基于点云的表面分割任务的开发，而且我们丰富点云数据集的方法也可以应用于其他基准类型，为城市解释方法创建更多样化的评估数据集。",
