    "translated_abstract": "产量预测中的可解释性有助于充分探索机器学习模型的潜力，这些模型已经能够在各种产量预测方案中实现高精度。用于产量预测的数据是复杂的，模型通常难以理解。然而，通过使用自然分组的输入特征可以简化理解模型。例如，可以通过采集特征的时间或传感器来实现分组。解释机器学习模型的最新方法是通过Shapley values的博弈论方法实现的。为了处理特征组，通常将计算出的Shapley values相加，忽略了这种方法的理论限制。我们解释了Shapley values的概念，并介绍了一种在树结构上高效计算它们的算法，以直接计算预定特征组的Shapley values。",
