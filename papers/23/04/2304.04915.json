    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种名为AffectMachine-Classical的新音乐生成系统，能够实时生成情感古典音乐。AffectMachine被设计用于生物反馈系统（如脑-计算机接口），以帮助用户意识到和调节自己的动态情感状态。也就是说，该系统是为基于音乐的医疗技术开发的，支持用户实时情绪自我调节。我们提供了基于规则和概率的系统架构概述，描述了系统的主要方面及其创新之处。然后，我们展示了一项听众研究的结果，旨在验证该系统能够可靠地传达目标情感给听众。研究结果表明，AffectMachine-Classical在传达各种Arousal水平（$R^2 = .96$）方面非常有效，并且在Valence方面也非常令人信服（$R^2 = .90$）。将来的工作将把 AffectMachine-Classical嵌入到生物反馈应用中，以测试其在实时促进情绪调节方面的能力。",
