    "translated_abstract": "从生物数据推断得到的二叉进化树对于理解生物之间共享的进化历史至关重要。根据最大似然等某个最优性准则推断出树中潜在节点的位置是NP-hard问题，这推动了大量启发式方法的发展。然而，这些启发式方法通常缺乏一种系统性的方法来均匀采样随机树或有效地探索指数级增长的树空间，这对于机器学习等优化问题至关重要。因此，我们提出了Phylo2Vec，这是一种新的简明表示方法来表示进化树。Phylo2Vec将任何具有n个叶子的二叉树映射到长度为n的整数向量。我们证明了Phylo2Vec在空间中既是良定的又是双射的。Phylo2Vec的优点是：i）轻松均匀采样二叉树；ii）以非常大或小的步长系统地遍历树空间。作为概念验证，我们使用Phylo2Vec构建了一个深度神经网络，以从氨基酸序列预测蛋白质类别。我们证明了Phylo2Vec显著提高了网络的性能，超过了之前的最优结果。",
