Our work makes use of outlier detection techniques to predict vulnerabilities that are likely to be exploited in highly imbalanced and high-dimensional datasets such as the National Vulnerability Database. We propose a dimensionality reduction technique, OutCenTR, that enhances the baseline outlier detection models.

    "translated_abstract": "每天都有越来越多的漏洞被报道，然而这些漏洞并不都是相同的，有些比其他的更具有针对性。正确估计漏洞被利用的可能性是系统管理员的关键任务。本文利用离群点检测技术来预测高度不平衡和高维度数据集中可能被利用的漏洞，例如国家漏洞数据库。我们提出了一种降维技术OutCenTR，可以增强基本的离群点检测模型。我们在4个基准数据集和12个合成数据集上通过实验证明了OutCenTR的有效性和效率。实验结果显示，与PCA和GRP等最先进的降维技术相比，平均F1分数提高了5倍。",
