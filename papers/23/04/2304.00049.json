    "abstract": "In many real-world settings, the critical class is rare and a missed detection carries a disproportionately high cost. For example, tumors are rare and a false negative diagnosis could have severe consequences on treatment outcomes; fraudulent banking transactions are rare and an undetected occurrence could result in significant losses or legal penalties.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to address the challenge of minimizing false positives for systems that need to operate at a high true positive rate. We propose a ranking-based regularization (RankReg) approach that is easy to implement, and show empirically that it not only effectively reduces false positives, but also complements conventional imbalanced learning losses.

    "translated_abstract": "在许多实际场景中，关键类别往往是稀有的，漏检会带来不成比例的高代价。例如，肿瘤是罕见的，误诊会对治疗结果产生严重影响；欺诈银行交易是罕见的，未被发现的情况可能导致巨大的损失或法律惩罚。在这种情况下，系统通常以较高的真阳性率运行，这可能需要容忍较高的假阳性率。本文提出了一种新颖的方法来解决需要在高真阳性率下运行的系统最小化假阳性的挑战。我们提出一种基于排序的正则化（RankReg）方法，易于实现，并经验性地表明它不仅能有效地减少假阳性，而且还与传统的不平衡学习损失相辅相成。使用这种新颖技术，我们在三个广泛探索的数据集（CIFAR-10＆100和黑色素瘤检测）上进行了一系列实验，以证明我们方法的有效性。",
