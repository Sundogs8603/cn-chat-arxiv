    "translated_abstract": "质量控制一直被认为是确保神经影像学研究可靠性的重要因素。对于胎儿脑 MRI 尤为重要，因为胎动频繁且不可预测，会导致图像中产生严重伪影。现有的胎儿脑质量评估方法仅从 \\textit{层面} 考虑，无法全面了解图像质量，而评估整个脑容积才能实现这一点。本文提出了 FetMRQC，一种针对胎儿脑 MRI 的自动图像质量评估机器学习框架，该框架提取一系列质量指标，并使用这些指标预测专家评分。基于在两个不同机构收集的超过 1000 个低分辨率胎儿脑 MRI 样本的手动评分，我们发现 FetMRQC 能够一般化到其他数据集，并且是可解释的和高效的。我们还发布了一个新颖的机器学习数据集，其中包括高质量和低质量的胎儿脑 MRI 容积和专家评分。",
