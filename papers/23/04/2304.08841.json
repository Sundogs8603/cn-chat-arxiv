    "translated_abstract": "源定位是图信息传播的反问题，具有广泛的实际应用。然而，信息传播中的内在复杂性和不确定性带来了重大挑战，而源定位问题的病态使这些挑战更加严峻。最近，特别是受经典非平衡热力学启发的扩散模型，尤其是深度生成模型取得了显著进展。虽然扩散模型在解决反问题和产生高质量重建方面已经被证明是有效的，但直接将其应用于源定位是不可行的，这是因为有两个原因。首先，在大规模网络上计算后验传播结果进行迭代去噪采样是不可能的，这将导致巨大的计算成本。其次，在现有的方法中，训练数据本身是病态的（多对一）；因此，简单地将扩散模型转移到此领域会导致令人不满意的性能。在本文中，我们提出了一个两阶段去噪扩散模型，通过两个阶段对后验传播图进行迭代去噪来解决图上源定位问题。所提出的模型将扩散模型的优点与去噪技术相结合，并通过采用更高效的消息传递算法克服了计算上的不可行性。在合成和真实数据集上的实验结果证明了我们所提出的模型的有效性和优越性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a two-stage denoising diffusion model for source localization in graph inverse problems, which iteratively denoises the posterior dissemination map in two stages, effectively solving the challenges of computational infeasibility and ill-posed training data. The proposed model combines the advantages of diffusion models with denoising techniques, achieving both accuracy and computational efficiency."
