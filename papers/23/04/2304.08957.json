    "translated_abstract": "气候政策分析中的排放路径通常来自综合评估模型(IAMs)。然而，这些排放路径通常不考虑气候对社会经济系统的反馈作用，因此也没有考虑气候不确定性。本文表明，仅仅气候不确定性就显著地改变了最优CO$_2$减排量成本效益，对于一组限制升温在1.5摄氏度以下低超温度控制情景，2050年的减排量变化范围在-14到+12 GtCO$_2$ yr$^{-1}$之间。此情景下，碳社会成本的范围变化达到了五倍。平衡气候敏感性(ECS)和现有气溶胶辐射强度是碳社会成本和中世纪最佳二氧化碳排放量的强烈决定因素。这表明，减少气候不确定性可以精确计算减排投入的成本，同时也指出了气候和排放之间缺失的反馈。",
