    "abstract": "Public infrastructure procurement is crucial as a prerequisite for public and private investments and for economic and social capital growth. However, low performance in execution severely hinders infrastructure provision and benefits delivery. One of the most sensitive phases in public infrastructure procurement is the design because of the strategic relationship that it potentially creates between procurers and contractors in the execution stage, affecting the costs and the duration of the contract. In this paper, using recent developments in non-parametric frontiers and propensity score matching, we evaluate the performance in the execution of public works in Italy. The analysis provides robust evidence of significant improvement of performance where procurers opt for a design and build contracts, which lead to lower transaction costs, allowing contractors to better accommodate the project in the execution. Our findings bear considerable policy implications.",

    "translated_abstract": "公共基础设施采购是公共和私人投资以及经济和社会资本增长的先决条件。然而，执行低效严重阻碍了基础设施提供和利益交付。公共基础设施采购最敏感的阶段之一是设计，因为它潜在地在执行阶段创建采购人和承包商之间的战略关系，影响合同的成本和持续时间。在本文中，利用非参数前沿和倾向性得分匹配的最新发展，我们评估了意大利公共工程执行的表现。分析提供了有力的证据，表明采购人选择设计和建造合同可以显著提高执行绩效，从而降低交易成本，使承包商可以更好地适应项目的执行。我们的发现具有相当大的政策含义。",
