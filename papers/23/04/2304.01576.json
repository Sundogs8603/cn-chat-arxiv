    "translated_abstract": "准确的肺结节分割对早期肺癌诊断非常重要，因为它可以大大提高患者的生存率。计算机断层扫描（CT）图像被广泛用于肺结节分析的早期诊断。然而，肺结节的异质性，大小多样性以及周围环境的复杂性对开发鲁棒的结节分割方法提出了挑战。在本研究中，我们提出了一个高效的端到端框架，即基于多编码器的自适应硬注意力网络（MESAHA-Net），用于CT扫描中精确的肺结节分割。MESAHA-Net包括三个编码路径，一个注意力块和一个解码器块，有助于集成三种类型的输入：CT切片补丁，前向和后向的最大强度投影（MIP）图像以及包含结节的感兴趣区域（ROI）掩码。通过采用新颖的自适应硬注意力机制，MESAHA-Net逐层执行逐层2D分割。",
