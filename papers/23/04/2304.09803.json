    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能在工业和社会中的应用日益增多，有效的人机交互系统变得越来越重要。人与人工智能交互的一个重要挑战是估计针对单个任务实例人类和人工智能代理的难度。这些估计对于评估每个代理的能力至关重要，因此有助于实现有效的协作。迄今为止，人机交互领域的研究独立地估计了人类和人工智能的知觉难度。然而，人工智能代理和人类代理之间的有效交互取决于准确反映每个代理在实现有价值的结果时的知觉难度的度量标准。迄今为止，研究尚未充分探讨人类和人工智能的知觉难度差异。因此，本研究回顾了人机交互中关于知觉难度的最新研究以及对每个代理的难度估计的贡献因素进行了一致的比较。",
