    "translated_abstract": "理解 COVID-19 疫苗犹豫现象（如何以及为什么犹豫）对于控制流行病最有效的方法之一，即大规模接种疫苗非常重要。这种理解还为未来的流行病设计成功的接种运动提供了见解。不幸的是，从文化的角度来看，有很多因素涉及决定是否接种疫苗。为了实现这些目标，我们设计了一种新的文化意识机器学习（ML）模型，基于我们的新数据收集，用于预测接种意愿。我们进一步使用先进的 AI 解释器分析了对 ML 模型预测有贡献的最重要特征，如概率图模型（PGM）和 Shapley Additive Explanations（SHAP）。这些分析揭示了最有可能影响疫苗接种决策的关键因素。我们的研究发现，西班牙裔和非洲裔美国人最有可能受到文化差异的影响。",
