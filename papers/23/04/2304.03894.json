    "abstract": "We introduce a novel continual learning method based on multifidelity deep neural networks. This method learns the correlation between the output of previously trained models and the desired output of the model on the current training dataset, limiting catastrophic forgetting. On its own the multifidelity continual learning method shows robust results that limit forgetting across several datasets. Additionally, we show that the multifidelity method can be combined with existing continual learning methods, including replay and memory aware synapses, to further limit catastrophic forgetting. The proposed continual learning method is especially suited for physical problems where the data satisfy the same physical laws on each domain, or for physics-informed neural networks, because in these cases we expect there to be a strong correlation between the output of the previous model and the model on the current training domain.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种基于多保真深度神经网络的新型持续学习方法。该方法学习前几个模型输出结果和当前训练数据集上期望输出结果的相关性，从而限制灾难性遗忘。多保真持续学习方法本身表现出鲁棒结果，可以限制多个数据集的遗忘。此外，我们还展示了多保真方法可以与现有的持续学习方法（包括重放和记忆感知突触）相结合，以进一步限制灾难性遗忘。该持续学习方法特别适用于满足每个领域上相同物理定律或具备物理学先验知识的神经网络等物理问题，因为在这些情况下，我们预计前一个模型的输出结果与当前训练领域中的模型之间存在强相关性。",
