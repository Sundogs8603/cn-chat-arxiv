    "translated_abstract": "自动音频事件识别在使人机交互更加紧密方面发挥着关键作用，并在工业自动化、控制和监视系统中具有广泛的适用性。音频事件由纷繁复杂的声韵模式组成，它们在谐波上纠缠在一起。音频识别主要受低级和中级特征的控制，这些特征已证明其识别能力，但计算成本高且语义意义低。本文提出了一种新的计算效率高的音频识别框架。Audio Bank是一种新的音频高级表征，由在频率时间空间中表示每个音频类别的独特音频检测器组成。通过使用非负矩阵分解减少结果特征向量的维数，同时保留其可区分性和丰富的语义信息。对两个公开可用数据集使用多个分类器（SVM、神经网络、高斯过程分类和k最近邻）进行音频识别，证明了Audio Bank框架的高效性。",

Non-negative matrix factorization is used to reduce the dimensionality of the resulting feature vector while preserving its discriminability and rich semantic information. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through high audio recognition performance using several classifiers on two publicly available datasets."
