    "abstract": "By summarizing longer consumer health questions into shorter and essential ones, medical question answering (MQA) systems can more accurately understand consumer intentions and retrieve suitable answers. However, medical question summarization is very challenging due to obvious distinctions in health trouble descriptions from patients and doctors. Although existing works have attempted to utilize Seq2Seq, reinforcement learning, or contrastive learning to solve the problem, two challenges remain: how to correctly capture question focus to model its semantic intention, and how to obtain reliable datasets to fairly evaluate performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel medical question summarization framework using entity-driven contrastive learning (ECL). ECL employs medical entities in frequently asked questions (FAQs) as focuses and devises an effective mechanism to generate hard negative samples. This approach forces models to pay attention to the crucial focu",
