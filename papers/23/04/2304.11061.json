    "translated_abstract": "作为无监督学习中最基本的挑战之一，文本聚类旨在将语义上相似的文本段分组，而不依赖于人工注释。随着深度学习的迅速发展，深度聚类在传统聚类方法上取得了显著优势。尽管有效，大多数现有的深度文本聚类方法严重依赖于在一般领域预训练的表示，这可能不是在特定目标领域聚类的最佳解决方案。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了CEIL，一种新颖的短文本聚类分类增强迭代学习框架，旨在通过将分类目标引入迭代地改进特征表示的方法，从而普遍提高聚类性能。在每个迭代中，我们首先采用语言模型检索初始文本表示，然后使用我们提出的分类不可分割分布（CDC）模块收集聚类结果。然后，我们引入分类模块将分类目标整合到聚类框架中，并使用得到的改进特征表示在下一次迭代中。对多个基准数据集的广泛实验证明了CEIL的有效性以及其优于现有最先进算法的优越性。",
