    "abstract": "The natural world is full of complex systems characterized by intricate relations between their components: from social interactions between individuals in a social network to electrostatic interactions between atoms in a protein. Topological Deep Learning (TDL) provides a comprehensive framework to process and extract knowledge from data associated with these systems, such as predicting the social community to which an individual belongs or predicting whether a protein can be a reasonable target for drug development. TDL has demonstrated theoretical and practical advantages that hold the promise of breaking ground in the applied sciences and beyond. However, the rapid growth of the TDL literature has also led to a lack of unification in notation and language across Topological Neural Network (TNN) architectures. This presents a real obstacle for building upon existing works and for deploying TNNs to new real-world problems. To address this issue, we provide an accessible introduction ",

    "translated_abstract": "自然界中充满了复杂的系统，其组成部分之间存在错综复杂的关系：从社交网络中个体之间的社交互动到蛋白质中原子之间的静电相互作用。拓扑深度学习（TDL）提供了一个全面的框架来处理和从这些系统相关的数据中提取知识，如预测一个人属于哪个社区或预测一个蛋白质是否可以成为合理的药物开发靶点。TDL已经证明拥有理论和实践上的优势，这为在应用科学和其他领域开拓新局面提供了希望。然而，TDL文献的快速增长也导致了拓扑神经网络（TNN）体系结构符号和术语上的不一致。这对于建立在现有工作基础上和将TNN部署到新的现实问题中都是一个真正的障碍。为了解决这个问题，我们提供了一个易于理解的综述。",
