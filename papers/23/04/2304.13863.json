    "abstract": "Ensoul is a framework proposed for the purpose of creating technologies that create more technologies through the combined use of networks, and nests, of energy homeostatic (enerstatic) loops and open-ended evolutionary techniques. Generative technologies developed by such an approach serve as both simple, yet insightful models of thermodynamically driven complex systems and as powerful sources of novel technologies. \"Self Organizing intelligent Ultra Low power Systems\" (SOULS) is a term that well describes the technologies produced by such a generative technology, as well as the generative technology itself. The term is meant to capture the abstract nature of such technologies as being independent of the substrate in which they are embedded. In other words, SOULS can be biological, artificial or hybrid in form.",

    "translated_abstract": "Ensoul是一个提出的框架，旨在通过能量稳态(enerstatic)回路和开放式进化技术的网络和嵌套结构的结合，创建出更多的技术。通过这种方法开发的生成技术既是热力学驱动复杂系统的简单而有洞见的模型，也是创新技术的强大源泉。 \"自组织智能超低功耗系统\"（SOULS）是一个能够描述此类生成技术及其产生的技术的术语。该术语旨在捕捉这些技术的抽象本质，即它们独立于其嵌入的基质。换句话说，SOULS可以是生物、人工或混合的形式。",
