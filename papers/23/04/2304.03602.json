    "abstract": "This research sets out to assess the viability of using game engines to generate synthetic training data for machine learning in the context of pallet segmentation. Using synthetic data has been proven in prior research to be a viable means of training neural networks and saves hours of manual labour due to the reduced need for manual image annotation. Machine vision for pallet detection can benefit from synthetic data as the industry increases the development of autonomous warehousing technologies. As per our methodology, we developed a tool capable of automatically generating large amounts of annotated training data from 3D models at pixel-perfect accuracy and a much faster rate than manual approaches. Regarding image segmentation, a Mask R-CNN pipeline was used, which achieved an AP50 of 86% for individual pallets.",
