    "translated_abstract": "冠状病毒是一种带膜的、非分段的正链RNA病毒，属于冠状病毒科。它严重感染各种动物，主要是哺乳动物和禽鸟，引起严重担忧，如最近的大流行病（COVID-19）。因此，深入理解这些病毒对制定预防和缓解机制至关重要。 在冠状病毒基因组中，一个重要的结构区域是刺突区域，它负责将病毒附着在宿主细胞膜上。因此，使用仅刺突蛋白而不是完整基因组，提供了执行诸如宿主分类之类的分析所需的大部分基本信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法，通过分析来自不同病毒亚属和物种的刺突蛋白序列，预测冠状病毒的宿主特异性。我们的方法涉及使用泊松校正距离生成距离矩阵，然后基于该矩阵对刺突蛋白序列进行聚类。我们在各种数据集上评估了我们的方法，并取得了有希望的结果，优于几种最先进的方法。",
