    "translated_abstract": "只有当解释方法忠实地描述所解释的模型时，解释方法才有价值。本文考虑了神经网络，其预测在特定对称群下具有不变性，这包括从卷积神经网络到图神经网络的流行架构。任何忠实描述这种类型模型的解释都需要与该不变性属性一致。我们通过运用几何深度学习的形式化方法，通过解释不变性和等变性的概念来形式化这种直觉。通过这种严格的形式化方法，我们得出了（1）两个度量来衡量任何解释方法相对于模型对称群的健壮性;（2）一些流行的解释方法的理论健壮性保证；（3）提高任何解释方法相对于对称群的不变性的系统方法。通过在与不同对称群相关的模型的解释中经验地测量我们的度量标准，我们展示了解释不变性和等变性对于强大的解释方法是重要的属性。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes the concepts of explanation invariance and equivariance to measure the robustness of interpretability methods, and provides theoretical guarantees and systematic approaches to improve the interpretability methods' invariance property. These are demonstrated through empirical measurements of metrics for explanations of models associated with different symmetry groups."
