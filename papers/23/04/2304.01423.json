In this paper, contextual keywords are extracted using thematic events with the help of data association. The thematic context for events is identified using the uncertainty principle in the proposed system. The thematic contexts are weighed with the help of vectors called thematic context vectors which signifies the event as certain or uncertain.

    "translated_abstract": "关键词提取是文本挖掘中的关键步骤。在Twitter数据中提取伴随相关事件的关键词是一个巨大的挑战。主要挑战在于所使用的语言非正式。拼写错误的单词、缩略语和歧义性术语的使用导致了非正式。目前系统中提取非正式语言下的关键词是基于模式或事件基础的。本文提出了一种基于数据关联的使用主题事件提取上下文关键词的方法。使用不确定性原理识别事件的主题上下文。使用称为主题上下文向量的矢量对主题上下文进行权重计算，这些矢量表示事件的确定或不确定。在Twitter COVID-19数据集上测试了系统并证明其有效性。该系统从测试数据集中提取特定于事件的主题上下文向量并对其进行排名。提取的主题上下文向量用于推断关键词。",
