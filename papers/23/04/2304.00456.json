This study aims to provide a roadmap for existing mid-rise building retrofits in order to understand the required capital investment, energy savings, energy cost savings, and carbon footprint for mid-rise residential buildings in Canada. This study employed EnergyPlus to examine the energy performance of 11 energy retrofit measures for a typical multi-unit residential building (MURB) in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The author employed the energy simulation software (EnergyPlus) to evaluate the pre-and post-retrofit operational energy performance of the selected MURB.

The energy simulation results were combined with cost and emission impact data to evaluate the economic and environmental performance of the selected energy retrofit measures. The results indi",
