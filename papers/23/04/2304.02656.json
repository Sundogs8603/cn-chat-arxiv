    "abstract": "Advances in deep learning models have revolutionized the study of biomolecule systems and their mechanisms. Graph representation learning, in particular, is important for accurately capturing the geometric information of biomolecules at different levels. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the methodologies used to represent biological molecules and systems as computer-recognizable objects, such as sequences, graphs, and surfaces. Moreover, it examines how geometric deep learning models, with an emphasis on graph-based techniques, can analyze biomolecule data to enable drug discovery, protein characterization, and biological system analysis.
