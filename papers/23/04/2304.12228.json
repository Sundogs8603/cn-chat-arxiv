    "translated_abstract": "异构图神经网络（HGNNs）作为一种新兴技术已经展示出在处理异构信息网络（HIN）方面具有卓越的能力。然而，大多数HGNNs遵循半监督学习方式，这明显限制了它们在现实中的广泛应用，因为真实应用中标签通常很少。最近，自监督方法中的对比学习成为最令人兴奋的学习范式之一，并在没有标签时显示出巨大潜力。在本文中，我们研究了自监督HGNNs的问题，并提出了一种新颖的HGNNs的共同对比学习机制，称为HeCo。不同于传统的对比学习只关注对比正负样本，HeCo采用了交叉视图对比机制。具体而言，提出了HIN的两个视图（网络架构和元路径视图）以学习节点嵌入，从而捕捉局部和高阶结构。",
