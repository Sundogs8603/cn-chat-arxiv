    "abstract": "In order for robots to follow open-ended instructions like \"go open the brown cabinet over the sink\", they require an understanding of both the scene geometry and the semantics of their environment. Robotic systems often handle these through separate pipelines, sometimes using very different representation spaces, which can be suboptimal when the two objectives conflict. In this work, we present USA-Net, a simple method for constructing a world representation that encodes both the semantics and spatial affordances of a scene in a differentiable map. This allows us to build a gradient-based planner which can navigate to locations in the scene specified using open-ended vocabulary. We use this planner to consistently generate trajectories which are both shorter 5-10% shorter and 10-30% closer to our goal query in CLIP embedding space than paths from comparable grid-based planners which don't leverage gradient information. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end differentiable plan",

    "translated_abstract": "为了让机器人能够按照“去打开水槽上方的棕色橱柜”等开放式指令行动，它们需要理解场景几何形状和环境语义。机器人系统通常通过分开不同的流程来处理这些指令，有时使用非常不同的表示空间，当两个目标冲突时这可能是次优的。本文介绍USA-Net，这是一种简单的方法，用于构建可微分地图的世界表示，该地图编码了场景的语义和空间作用，从而使我们能够构建基于梯度的规划器，该规划器可以导航到使用开放式词汇指定的场景位置。在CLIP嵌入空间中，我们使用此规划器一贯生成较短（5-10%）和更接近目标查询（10-30%）的路径，而这些路径来自不利用梯度信息的可比较基于网格的规划器，据我们所知，这是第一个端到端可微的计划系统，可以处理开放式自然语言命令而无需进行任何特定任务的手动工程。",

It is the first end-to-end differentiable planning system that can handle open-ended natural language commands without any task-specific hand-engineering."
