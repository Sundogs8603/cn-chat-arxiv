Specifically, we consider mini-batch $k$-means which terminates only when the improvement in the quality of the clustering on the sampled batch is below some threshold.  Although at first glance it appears that this algorithm might execute forever, we answer the above question in the affirmative and show that if the batch is of size $\\tilde{\\Omega}((d/\\epsilon)^2)$, it must terminate within $O(d/\\epsilon)$ iterations with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension of the input, and $\\epsilon$ is a threshold parameter for termination. This is true regardless of how the centers are initialized. When the algorithm is initialized with the $k$-means++ initialization scheme, it achieves an approximation ratio of $O(\\log k)$ (the same as the full-batch version).  Finally, we show the applicability of our results to the mini-batch $k$-means algorithm implemented",

    "translated_abstract": "我们回答了这个问题：“小批量$k$-means（Min-batch $K$-Means）的局部进展（在批处理上）是否意味着全局进展（在整个数据集上）？”我们考虑了仅当在采样批处理的质量改进低于某个阈值时才终止的小批量$k$-means聚类方法。尽管乍一看这个算法可能永远不会执行完，但我们肯定地回答了上述问题，并表明，如果批次大小为$\\tilde{\\Omega}((d/\\epsilon)^2)$，则它必须在$O(d/\\epsilon)$次迭代内以高概率终止，其中$d$是输入的维度，$\\epsilon$是终止的阈值参数。这一点是有道理的，无论中心如何初始化。当算法使用$k$-means++初始化方案初始化时，它可以实现$O(\\log k)$（与完全批量版本相同）的逼近比。最后，我们展示了我们的结果对小批量$k$-means聚类算法的适用性。",
