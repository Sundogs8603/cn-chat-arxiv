    "abstract": "How and why do incentive levels affect strategic behavior? This paper examines an experiment designed to identify the causal effect of scaling up incentives on choices and beliefs in strategic settings by holding fixed opponents' actions. In dominance-solvable games, higher incentives increase action sophistication and best-response rates and decrease mistake propensity. Beliefs tend to become more accurate with higher own incentives in simple games. However, opponents with higher incentive levels are harder to predict: while beliefs track opponents' behavior when they have higher incentive levels, beliefs about opponents also become more biased. We provide evidence that incentives affect cognitive effort and that greater effort increases performance and predicts choice and belief sophistication. Overall, the data lends support to combining both payoff-dependent mistakes and costly reasoning.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一个实验，以确定激励水平对战略设置下选择和信念的因果效应，其中对手的行为被固定。在支配可解的游戏中，更高的激励水平增加了行动的复杂性和最佳响应率，并减少了错误倾向。在简单游戏中，更高自身激励往往使得信念更加准确。然而，具有更高激励水平的对手更难预测：当对手具有更高激励水平时，信念会跟踪对手的行为，但对对手的信念也会变得更加有偏见。我们提供证据表明激励影响了认知努力，并且更大的努力提高了表现，并且预测了选择和信念的复杂性。总的来说，数据支持将依赖于回报的错误与昂贵的推理相结合。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study explores the causal effect of incentivization in strategic settings, finding that in dominance-solvable games, higher incentives lead to increased action sophistication and accuracy, while in simpler games they lead to increased belief accuracy. However, higher incentives in opponents lead to more biased beliefs and harder predictability. The study also suggests that cognitive effort is affected by incentives, and greater effort predicts increased performance and sophistication in choices and beliefs."
