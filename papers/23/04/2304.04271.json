    "translated_abstract": "由于领域专业知识和数据的动态性，标记时间序列数据是一项昂贵的任务。因此，我们经常需要处理有限标记数据的情况。数据增强技术已成功应用于诸如计算机视觉之类的领域，以利用现有标记数据的使用。我们将其中一种最常用的技术MixUp，应用于时序领域。我们的提出的MixUp++和LatentMixUp++方法分别对原始时间序列和分类模型的潜在空间进行插值的简单修改。我们也通过半监督学习将这些方法扩展到无标签数据。我们观察到，对于两个公共数据集的时间序列分类，无论是低标记数据还是高标记数据制度，通过LatentMixUp ++，都可以显著提高1％- 15％。",
