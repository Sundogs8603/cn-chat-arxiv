    "translated_abstract": "脑肿瘤是导致癌症死亡的主要原因之一，高级别的脑肿瘤甚至在标准治疗后容易复发。因此，开发一种预测脑肿瘤复发位置的方法在治疗规划中起着重要作用，并有可能延长患者的生存时间。本文提出了一种基于深度学习的脑肿瘤复发位置预测网络。由于数据集通常很小，我们提出使用迁移学习来提高预测技术。我们首先在公共数据集BraTS 2021上训练一个多模态脑肿瘤分割网络。然后，将预训练的编码器转移到我们的私有数据集中，以提取丰富的语义特征。接下来，我们开发了一个多尺度多通道特征融合模型和一个非线性相关学习模块来学习有效的特征。多通道特征之间的相关性由一个非线性关系模型建模。",
