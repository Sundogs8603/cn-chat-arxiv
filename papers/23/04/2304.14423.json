    "translated_abstract": "战斗机飞行员的训练中很大一部分是基于模拟的，并涉及由预定义行为模型控制的计算机生成的力量。这些行为模型通常是通过从经验丰富的飞行员中获取知识手动创建的，这是一个耗时的过程。尽管花费了很多精力，但由于它们可预测的性质和缺乏适应性，行为模型通常是不尽如人意的，迫使教练花费时间手动监控和控制它们。强化学习和模仿学习成为手工制作模型的替代方案。本文介绍了针对空中作战行为的学习环境（LEAD），一种用于在军事模拟中创建和集成智能空中作战行为的系统。通过整合流行的编程库和接口Gymnasium，LEAD允许用户应用现成的机器学习算法。此外，LEAD可以通过分布式仿真协议与第三方模拟软件进行通信。",
