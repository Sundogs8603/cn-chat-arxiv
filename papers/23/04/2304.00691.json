    "abstract": "Lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) degrade slightly until the knee onset, after which the deterioration accelerates to end of life (EOL). The knee onset, which marks the initiation of the accelerated degradation rate, is crucial in providing an early warning of the battery's performance changes. However, there is only limited literature on online knee onset identification. Furthermore, it is good to perform such identification using easily collected measurements. To solve these challenges, an online knee onset identification method is developed by exploiting the temporal information within the discharge data. First, the temporal dynamics embedded in the discharge voltage cycles from the slight degradation stage are extracted by the dynamic time warping. Second, the anomaly is exposed by Matrix Profile during subsequence similarity search. The knee onset is detected when the temporal dynamics of the new cycle exceed the control limit and the profile index indicates a change in regime. Finally",

    "translated_abstract": "锂离子电池会在到达膝部起始点后逐渐恶化并加速衰减至寿命结束前。在提供电池性能变化的早期预警方面，膝部起始点具有关键作用。然而，目前仅有有限的文献研究了在线膝部起始点的识别。此外，使用易于采集的测量数据进行识别是非常必要的。为了解决这些挑战，通过利用放电数据中的时间信息，开发了一种在线膝部起始点识别方法。首先，利用动态时间规整提取从轻微磨损阶段开始的放电电压周期中的时间动态变化。然后，在子序列相似性搜索期间，利用矩阵剖面暴露异常。当新周期的时间动态超过控制极限且剖面指数表示出制度变化时，检测到膝部起始点。最后，采用实验结果证明了所提出方法的有效性。",
