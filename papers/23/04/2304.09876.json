    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习(Fl)是一种去中心化模型训练方法，为农业领域提供了改善机器学习性能的潜力，确保了个体农场或数据孤立的安全和隐私。然而，传统的FL方法存在两个主要限制。首先，个体数据的异构性会导致全局模型在某些客户端表现良好，但不是所有客户端，因为在聚合后，某些客户端的更新方向可能会妨碍其他客户端。其次，它在FL过程中缺乏效率方面的考虑，包括通信成本和大模型尺寸。本文提出了一种利用客户端模型剪枝和聚合修剪模型的新技术解决方案。该方法使本地模型能够适应其各自的数据分布，在农业食品数据中缓解数据异质性。此外，它允许更紧凑的模型，消耗少量数据进行传输。",
