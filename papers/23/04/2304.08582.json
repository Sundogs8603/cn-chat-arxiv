    "abstract": "The enormous use of sarcastic text in all forms of communication in social media will have a physiological effect on target users. Each user has a different approach to misusing and recognising sarcasm. Sarcasm detection is difficult even for users, and this will depend on many things such as perspective, context, special symbols. So, that will be a challenging task for machines to differentiate sarcastic sentences from non-sarcastic sentences. There are no exact rules based on which model will accurately detect sarcasm from many text corpus in the current situation. So, one needs to focus on optimistic and forthcoming approaches in the sarcasm detection domain. This paper discusses various sarcasm detection techniques and concludes with some approaches, related datasets with optimal features, and the researcher's challenges.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体中讽刺文本的广泛使用对目标用户产生生理作用。每个用户对误用和识别讽刺的方法不同。讽刺检测即使对于用户来说也是困难的，这将取决于很多因素，如视角、语境、特殊符号等。因此，让机器从众多文本语料库中区分讽刺句子和非讽刺句子将是一个具有挑战性的任务。在目前的情况下，没有确切的规则可以使模型准确地检测出讽刺。因此，需要重点关注乐观和前瞻性的讽刺检测方法。本文讨论了各种讽刺检测技术，并以一些方法、相关数据集以及研究人员面临的挑战作为结论。",
