    "abstract": "There exists a correlation between geospatial activity temporal patterns and type of land use. A novel self-supervised approach is proposed to stratify landscape based on mobility activity time series. First, the time series signal is transformed to the frequency domain and then compressed into task-agnostic temporal embeddings by a contractive autoencoder, which preserves cyclic temporal patterns observed in time series. The pixel-wise embeddings are converted to image-like channels that can be used for task-based, multimodal modeling of downstream geospatial tasks using deep semantic segmentation. Experiments show that temporal embeddings are semantically meaningful representations of time series data and are effective across different tasks such as classifying residential area and commercial areas.",

    "translated_abstract": "地理活动的时间模式与用地类型之间存在着相关性。本文提出了一种新的自监督方法，根据移动活动时间序列对景观进行分层。首先，将时间序列信号转换为频域，然后通过压缩自编码器将其压缩为任务无关的时间嵌入，该嵌入保留了时间序列中观察到的周期性时间模式。像素级的嵌入被转换为类似图像的通道，可以用于基于任务的下游地理空间任务的多模态建模，其中采用了深度语义分割。实验证明，时间嵌入是时间序列数据的语义有意义的表征，并且对于分类居民区和商业区等不同任务是有效的。",
