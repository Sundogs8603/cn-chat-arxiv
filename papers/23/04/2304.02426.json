    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）如 ChatGPT 和 GPT-4 在各种自然语言处理（NLP）任务上展现出了卓越的能力，包括在聊天过程中完成各种机器翻译能力。然而，这些模型只能通过受限的API访问，这为新的研究和领域进展带来了障碍。因此，我们提出了 ParroT 框架，基于开源LLM（如LLaMA-7b）和人工编写的翻译评估数据来增强和规范聊天翻译能力。具体而言，ParroT将翻译数据转化为指令执行的样式，并引入 \"Hint \" 字段以加入额外要求来规范翻译过程。因此，我们提出了三种指令类型来微调 ParroT 模型，包括翻译指令、对比指令和误差引导指令。在两个 Flores 子集和 WMT22 测试集上的实验证明，使用 ParroT 可以大幅提高翻译质量，且需要相对较少的训练数据。",
