    "translated_abstract": "降噪扩散模型是新近涌现的一种生成模型，它在无条件图像生成和语音生成等众多领域实现了最先进的成果。它们由破坏数据的加噪过程和定义为加噪扩散的时间反演的后向阶段组成。以这些成功为基础，扩散模型最近扩展到了黎曼流形设置。然而，这些黎曼扩散模型要求在所有时间上定义测地线。虽然该设置包括许多重要应用，但不包括由不等式约束集定义的流形，这在许多科学领域，如机器人和蛋白设计中是普遍存在的。在本文中，我们介绍了两种方法来弥合这个差距。首先，我们设计了一个基于不等式约束诱导的对数障碍度量的加噪过程。其次，我们介绍了一种基于反射布朗运动的加噪过程。由于现有的扩散模型不能直接应用于约束域，因此本文提出了两种方法来创建约束域的降噪扩散模型。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes two methods to create denoising diffusion models for manifolds defined by inequality constraints, expanding the scope of diffusion models to domains such as robotics and protein design. The first method uses a logarithmic barrier metric induced by the constraints to create the noising process, while the second method uses a reflected Brownian motion."
