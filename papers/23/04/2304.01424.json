    "abstract": "Sarcasm is an advanced linguistic expression often found on various online platforms. Sarcasm detection is challenging in natural language processing tasks that affect sentiment analysis. This article presents the inventive method of the semigraph, including semigraph construction and sarcasm detection processes. A variation of the semigraph is suggested in the pattern-relatedness of the text document. The proposed method is to obtain the sarcastic and non-sarcastic polarity scores of a document using a semigraph. The sarcastic polarity score represents the possibility that a document will become sarcastic. Sarcasm is detected based on the polarity scoring model. The performance of the proposed model enhances the existing prior art approach to sarcasm detection. In the Amazon product review, the model achieved the accuracy, recall, and f-measure of 0.87, 0.79, and 0.83, respectively.",

    "translated_abstract": "讽刺是在线平台上经常出现的高级语言表达。讽刺检测是一项具有挑战性的自然语言处理任务，它影响情感分析。本文提出了Semigraph的创新方法，包括Semigraph的构建和讽刺检测过程。在文本文档的模式关联性中建议了Semigraph的变体。提出的方法是使用Semigraph获得文档的讽刺和非讽刺情感极性得分。讽刺情感极性得分表示文档变得讽刺的可能性。基于情感极性评分模型检测讽刺。所提出的模型的表现优于现有的讽刺检测方法。在亚马逊产品评价中，该模型的准确率、召回率和f-measure分别为0.87、0.79和0.83。",
