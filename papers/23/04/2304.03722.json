    "abstract": "Generating synthetic data through generative models is gaining interest in the ML community and beyond. In the past, synthetic data was often regarded as a means to private data release, but a surge of recent papers explore how its potential reaches much further than this -- from creating more fair data to data augmentation, and from simulation to text generated by ChatGPT. In this perspective we explore whether, and how, synthetic data may become a dominant force in the machine learning world, promising a future where datasets can be tailored to individual needs. Just as importantly, we discuss which fundamental challenges the community needs to overcome for wider relevance and application of synthetic data -- the most important of which is quantifying how much we can trust any finding or prediction drawn from synthetic data.",

    "translated_abstract": "通过生成模型产生合成数据在机器学习社区和其他领域引发了广泛关注。过去，合成数据往往被视为公开私有数据的一种方式，但最近一系列的论文探讨了合成数据的潜力远非如此——从创建更公平的数据到数据增强，从模拟到ChatGPT生成的文本。在这篇文章中，我们探讨了合成数据是否及如何成为机器学习领域的主导力量，承诺未来数据集可以根据个人需求进行定制。同样重要的是，我们讨论了社区需要克服的基本挑战，以扩大合成数据的相关性和应用——其中最重要的是量化我们能够信任从合成数据中提取的任何发现或预测的程度。",
    "tldr": "合成数据的潜力远非私有化数据，而是包括创建更公平的数据，数据增强，模拟和生成更多样化的数据集，然而，合成数据的应用仍然需要克服基本挑战，最重要的是如何评估其可靠性。",
    "en_tdlr": "Synthetic data has vast potential beyond private data release, including creating fair data, data augmentation, simulation, and generating more diverse datasets. However, the application of synthetic data still faces fundamental challenges, especially in evaluating its reliability."
