    "translated_abstract": "文本分类通常需要大量的人工标注数据作为监督，这在动态新兴领域中是昂贵的。某些方法通过仅依赖类名表面文本作为极弱监督来解决这个问题。然而，现有方法未能考虑到单一类别文档讨论多个主题的情况。主题多样性和模糊的句子可能会引入噪声到文档的底层表示，从而影响预测类别的精度。此外，当前的方法独立地关注文档、句子或单词的文本粒度，从而限制了我们联合从所有三者中提取粗粒度或细粒度上下文的能力来识别分类的重要子文本。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了MEGClass，一种利用相互增强的文本粒度进行极弱监督文本分类的方法。具体来说，MEGClass通过分层关注机制从文档、句子和单词中提取连贯且多样的子文本，使我们能够识别和整合来自多个粒度的弱信号，以准确分类文档，即使它们讨论多个主题。在五个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的方法在使用极弱监督的情况下，比现有最先进的模型有着更好的表现。",

    "en_tdlr": "MEGClass is a method for extremely weakly-supervised text classification that exploits mutually-enhancing text granularities. It jointly extracts coherent and diverse subtext from documents, sentences, and words through a hierarchical attention mechanism to accurately classify documents, even when they discuss multiple topics. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets show that it outperforms state-of-the-art models using extremely weak supervision."
