    "translated_abstract": "论证问题关注于从它们的关系结构中确定一组参数的可接受性问题。当可用信息不确定时，概率论证框架提供了建模工具来解决这个问题。本文的首次贡献是将概率论证框架解释为概率逻辑程序。概率逻辑程序是逻辑程序，其中一些事实带有概率注释。我们展示了表示概率论证框架的程序不能满足概率逻辑编程(PLP)语义中的一项普遍假设，即概率事实完全捕捉到研究领域的不确定性。本文的第二个贡献是提出PLP语义的新方法，用于可以使用不同的概率事实来确定逻辑原子的真值分配的程序。本文的第三个贡献是对文献进行翻译。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel approach to interpret probabilistic argumentation frameworks as probabilistic logic programs, and presents a new PLP semantics to deal with uncertainty between different probabilistic facts. It has certain significance in the field of argumentation and reasoning."
