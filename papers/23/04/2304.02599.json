    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，对数凹采样在算法方面取得了显著的进展，但相应的证明此任务的下界的问题仍然很难，以前只知道在一维中存在较小的下界。在这项工作中，我们建立了以下查询下界：（1）在维度 $d\\ge 2$中从强对数凹和对数光滑分布中采样需要 $\\Omega(\\log \\kappa)$ 查询，这在任何固定维度上都是最优的，（2）从高斯分布中采样需要 $\\widetilde \\Omega(\\min(\\sqrt\\kappa \\log d, d))$ 查询（因此也适用于在维数 $d$ 中采样一般的对数凹和光滑分布），这对于高斯类几乎是最优的。这里 $\\kappa$ 是目标分布的条件数。我们的证明依赖于（1）一种多尺度构造，受到了关于谐振分析中的Kakeya猜想的工作的启发，以及（2）一种新颖的约简，证明了块Krylov算法在此问题中是最佳的。",
