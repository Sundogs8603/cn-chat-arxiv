In this technical report, we take an initiative to investigate their capacities of playing text games, in which a player has to understand the environment and respond to situations by having dialogues with the game world. Our experiments show that ChatGPT performs competitively compared to all the existing systems but still exhibits a low level of intelligence. Precisely, ChatGPT can not construct the world model by playing the game or even reading the game manual; it may fail to leverage the world knowledge that it already has; it cannot infer the goal of each step as the game progresses.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，诸如ChatGPT和GPT-4之类的大型语言模型展示了它们与人类用户通信的卓越能力。本技术报告旨在调查它们在玩文字游戏方面的能力，这要求玩家通过与游戏世界的对话来理解环境并对情况做出反应。我们的实验表明，与所有现有系统相比，ChatGPT表现出有竞争力，但仍然表现出较低的智能水平。确切地说，ChatGPT无法通过玩游戏或阅读游戏手册来构建世界模型；它可能无法利用它已经拥有的世界知识；它无法推断出随着游戏进展的每一步的目标。我们的结果在人工智能、机器学习和自然语言处理交叉领域开启了新的研究问题。",
