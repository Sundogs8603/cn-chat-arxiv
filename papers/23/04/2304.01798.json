    "translated_abstract": "基于归一化流的采样方法已经成功地解决了传统的模拟格子量子场论的计算难题。更进一步的研究将规范和平移不变性纳入到基础神经网络中，使模型在训练和推断时更高效。本文研究将动作积分的局部性纳入到模型中，从而简化了条件归一化流的输入域。我们采用自回归过程在子格子上采样并将其称为局部自回归条件归一化流（l-ACNF）。实验发现，相对于在二维格子上采样 $\\phi^{4}$ 理论的等效归一化流模型，l-ACNF 模型的自相关时间快速下降，更加高效。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种局部约束自回归条件归一化流模型，在格子场论的模拟中取得了很好的应用，并在二维 $\\phi^4$ 理论的采样中相比等效归一化流模型有数倍的性能提升。",
