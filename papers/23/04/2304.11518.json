    "translated_abstract": "研究中美关系一直是我们经济发展中的关键话题，而美国总统大选在塑造这些关系方面发挥着至关重要的作用。本文旨在分析2020年美国总统大选对中国的冲击，以便为2024年美国总统大选对中国经济的潜在影响做好准备。我们收集了近70年的统计数据，并分析了与美国经济相关的数据。通过使用分层分析法，我们对总统政策的实施进行了评估，以此获得了指标的全面排名。然后，我们对指标数据进行量化，并采用熵权法计算每个指标数据的权重。最后，我们使用加权总分计算方法评估了美国在高风险时期的经济状况，并评估了其对中国经济的影响。我们的研究为中国减少2020年美国总统大选对中国经济的负面影响提供了重要的见解和战略建议。",
