    "abstract": "We focus on the task of language-conditioned object placement, in which a robot should generate placements that satisfy all the spatial relational constraints in language instructions. Previous works based on rule-based language parsing or scene-centric visual representation have restrictions on the form of instructions and reference objects or require large amounts of training data. We propose an object-centric framework that leverages foundation models to ground the reference objects and spatial relations for placement, which is more sample efficient and generalizable. Experiments indicate that our model can achieve a 97.75% success rate of placement with only ~0.26M trainable parameters. Besides, our method generalizes better to both unseen objects and instructions. Moreover, with only 25% training data, we still outperform the top competing approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文关注于语言条件下的物体放置任务，即机器人应该生成满足语言说明中所有空间关系限制的放置。以往基于规则的语言解析或场景中心的视觉表示对指令形式和参考对象有限制或需要大量的训练数据。本文提出了一个基于物体中心的框架，利用基础模型来确定参考对象和空间关系以进行放置，该方法更加样本高效和可推广。实验表明，我们的模型只需 ~0.26M 可训练参数就能达到 97.75% 的放置成功率。此外，我们的方法对未见过的物体和说明都有更好的泛化能力。当只使用 25% 的训练数据时，我们仍然胜过顶级竞争方法。",
