    "translated_title": "基于联邦知识图谱嵌入的隐私威胁的量化和防御",
    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱嵌入是从知识图谱中提取表达性表示以促进各种下游任务的基础技术。新兴的联邦知识图谱嵌入（FKGE）从客户端所持有的分布式知识图谱中协同训练，同时避免交换客户端的敏感原始知识图谱。然而，FKGE仍然可能面临隐私威胁，这在其他联邦模型训练（例如神经网络）中已被证明。在本文中，我们从攻击和防御的角度，对FKGE的隐私威胁进行了第一次全面研究。就攻击而言，我们提出了三种新的推理攻击来量化隐私威胁，成功推断出受害客户端的知识图谱三元组的存在，从而揭示了实质性的隐私风险。针对防御，我们提出了DP-Flames，一种新型的差分隐私FKGE算法，能够通过紧密的隐私预算减轻被推断信息的损失。DP-Flames采用基于扰动的方法设计，并进一步融合了图嵌入中的关键技术，与非隐私基线相比，几乎没有损失，这提高了有用性。我们在三个现实世界的数据集上评估了攻击/防御性能，并展示了DP-Flames在过滤隐私损失和保持实用性方面的有效性。",

It proposes three new inference attacks and a novel differentially private FKGE algorithm (DP-Flames) to mitigate inferred information loss. DP-Flames is designed as a perturbation-based approach and demonstrates negligible loss in terms of utility compared with non-private baselines."
