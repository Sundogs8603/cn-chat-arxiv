    "translated_abstract": "关键词生成旨在通过从原始文本中复制（现有关键词）或生成捕捉文本语义意义的新关键词（缺失关键词）来生成话题短语。编码器-解码器模型在此任务中最广泛使用，因为它们具有生成缺失关键词的能力。然而，目前几乎没有对此类模型在关键词生成中的性能和行为进行分析。本文研究了三种强劲模型 T5（基于预训练变压器）、CatSeq-Transformer（非预训练变压器）和 ExHiRD（基于循环神经网络）所展示的各种趋势。我们分析了预测置信度分数、模型校准以及词元位置对关键词生成的影响。此外，我们提出并推动一个新的度量框架SoftKeyScore，通过使用 softscores 来计算部分匹配的相似度来评估两组关键词的相似性。",
