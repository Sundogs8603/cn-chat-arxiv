    "translated_abstract": "语言建模已经在生成具有良好准确性和高语义连贯性的令人信服的文本方面取得了重大进展。一个有趣的研究方向是使用上下文信息来增强这些强大的模型以用于特定的应用程序。在这项工作中，我们探索了面向医疗保健应用的多模态语言建模。我们对基于三角洲区域记录的首席投诉信息和生命体征的文本信息进行了结果预测和患者分诊。我们改编了Perceiver——一种通用变换器模型，它已经在多个应用程序中展现出可行的结果。由于生命体征模态以表格形式呈现，我们修改了Perceiver的位置编码以确保置换不变性。我们使用MIMIC-IV ED数据集上的120K次访问来评估多模态语言模型对诊断代码预测的任务。在实验分析中，我们展示了多模态改善了预测表现，相比于单模态模型，并且Perceiver在任务中胜过了其他现有的多模态语言模型。该模型在改进急诊科临床决策方面具有显著的潜力。",
