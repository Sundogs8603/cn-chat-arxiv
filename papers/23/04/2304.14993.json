    "translated_title": "ChatGPT - 对于本科计算机科学学生和教师是福是祸?",
    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT是由OpenAI开发的AI语言模型，可以理解和生成类人文本。它可用于语言生成、问答、文本摘要、聊天机器人开发、语言翻译、情感分析、内容创作、个性化、文本完成和故事叙述等多种用途。虽然ChatGPT受到了相当积极的关注，但在学术界也引起了一种担忧和不确定感。存在担忧学生可能会利用ChatGPT完成课外作业和考试，并获得有利的成绩，而不真正获得知识。本文采用定量方法，展示了ChatGPT在回答本科计算机科学范围内的各种问题上具有高度的不可靠性。我们的分析表明，学生盲目依赖ChatGPT完成作业和考试可能会自毁前程。我们在这个分析基础上提出了教师和学生如何在学术界使用ChatGPT的建议。",
