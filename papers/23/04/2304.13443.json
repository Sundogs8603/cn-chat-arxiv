    "abstract": "In the realm of urban transportation, metro systems serve as crucial and sustainable means of public transit. However, their substantial energy consumption poses a challenge to the goal of sustainability. Disturbances such as delays and passenger flow changes can further exacerbate this issue by negatively affecting energy efficiency in metro systems. To tackle this problem, we propose a policy-based reinforcement learning approach that reschedules the metro timetable and optimizes energy efficiency in metro systems under disturbances by adjusting the dwell time and cruise speed of trains. Our experiments conducted in a simulation environment demonstrate the superiority of our method over baseline methods, achieving a traction energy consumption reduction of up to 10.9% and an increase in regenerative braking energy utilization of up to 47.9%. This study provides an effective solution to the energy-saving problem of urban rail transit.",

    "translated_abstract": "在城市交通领域，地铁系统是关键的可持续公共交通工具。然而，它们的巨大能源消耗对可持续性目标构成了挑战。延误和乘客流变化等扰动进一步加剧了这个问题，因为它们会对地铁系统的能源效率产生负面影响。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于策略的强化学习方法，通过调整列车的停靠时间和巡航速度，重新安排地铁时刻表，并优化受扰动影响的地铁系统的能源效率。在模拟环境中进行的实验表明，我们的方法优于基线方法，实现了高达10.9％的牵引能量消耗降低和最高达47.9％的再生制动能量利用率提高。本研究为城市轨道交通节能问题提供了有效的解决方案。",
