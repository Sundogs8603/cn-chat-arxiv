    "translated_abstract": "行程推荐是一个具有许多实际应用的复杂的序列预测问题。当考虑到优化多个用户排队时间和人群水平时，这项任务变得更具挑战性，因为涉及到诸多参数，如景点受欢迎程度、排队时间、步行时间和营业时间等。现有的解决方案通常集中在单人视角上，未能解决自然人群行为引起的现实问题，如贪婪路由问题。本文介绍了一种名为“战略和众包意识行程推荐（SCAIR）”算法，该算法在现实环境中优化群体效用。我们将路线推荐策略建模为马尔可夫决策过程，并提出了一种状态编码机制，使得可以在线性时间内实现实时规划和分配。我们使用主题公园数据集对我们的算法进行各种竞争性和现实的基线测试，证明SCAIR优于其他算法。",
