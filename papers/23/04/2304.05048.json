    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the potential threat of adversarial examples to the security of face recognition systems. Although previous research has explored the adversarial risk to individual components of FRSs, our study presents an initial exploration of an adversary simultaneously fooling multiple components: the face detector and feature extractor in an FRS pipeline. We propose three multi-objective attacks on FRSs and demonstrate their effectiveness through a preliminary experimental analysis on a target system. Our attacks achieved up to 100% Attack Success Rates against both the face detector and feature extractor and were able to manipulate the face detection probability by up to 50% depending on the adversarial objective. This research identifies and examines novel attack vectors against FRSs and suggests possible ways to augment the robustness by leveraging the attack vector's knowledge during training of an FRS's components.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了对抗样本对面部识别系统安全性的潜在威胁。虽然以往的研究已经探讨了对FRS的各个单独组件的对抗风险，但我们的研究首次探索了通过同时攻击FRS管道中的人脸检测器和特征提取器来欺骗多个组件的可能性。我们提出了三种针对FRS的多目标攻击，并通过对目标系统的初步实验分析证明其有效性。我们的攻击成功率可以达到100％，能够操纵面部检测概率高达50％，具体取决于对抗目标。本研究确定并检查了针对FRS的新型攻击向量，并提出了利用攻击向量的知识在训练FRS组件时增强其鲁棒性的可能方法。",
