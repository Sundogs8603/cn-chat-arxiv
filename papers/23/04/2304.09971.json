    "translated_abstract": "收入和财富分配是经济运作的基础组成部分。这些是复杂的分布，使用平均值或中位数等简化方法很难真正感受到它们的动态。一个更好地描述该分布的指标是基尼系数，在一个极端是0，一个完全公平的分布，在另一个极端是1，最不公平的是一个人拥有所有资源。大多数专家认为，在任一极端都不存在可行的经济，但确定首选范围历来是有争议的政治哲学和情感诉求问题。本研究探讨的是是否存在一个理论和实证基础支持一个首选基尼系数。具体而言，我探讨了一个简单的问题：在金融系统存在之前，自然资产如何分配？高度，力量和美丽等内在人类属性是人类社会互动的原始价值衡量标准。通过研究人类学数据并应用经济理论，我发现史前社会对非金融财富的基尼系数有一个首选范围。随着人类社会的演变和发展更为复杂的政治结构，这个范围发生了变化。了解这个范围对于如何塑造现代经济系统具有影响。",
