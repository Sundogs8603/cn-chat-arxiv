    "translated_abstract": "器官移植是某些末期疾病（如肝衰竭）的基本治疗方法。分析器官移植后的死因可以为临床决策提供有力的工具，包括个性化治疗和器官分配。然而，传统方法如MELD评分和传统机器学习方法在死因分析中存在两个主要的数据和模型相关挑战，这限制了它们在此领域中的应用。为了克服这一难题，我们提出了一个新的框架CoD-MTL，利用多任务学习来共同模拟不同CoD预测任务之间的语义关系。具体来讲，我们开发了一种新的树蒸馏策略用于多任务学习，结合了树模型和多任务学习的优点。实验结果表明，我们的框架可以提供精确可靠的CoD预测。我们进行了一个案例研究，以展示该框架的临床重要性。",
