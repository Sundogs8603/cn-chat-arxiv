    "translated_abstract": "新闻报道涉及选择性过程，涵盖某一主题时不可避免地出现选择性偏见，即由于不同议题产生的报道选择不同所造成的讯息偏差。为了了解偏见的程度和影响，必须先发现以下两方面的内容：（1）新闻来源通常在哪些议题上对“值得报道”的信息定义存在分歧；（2）内容选择模式是否与新闻来源的某些属性（如意识形态倾向等）相关联。本文旨在探讨从海量新闻语料库直接发现媒体选择性偏见模式的可扩展NLP系统的挑战，并提出和研究一个概念框架，比较不同来源如何报道某些有争议的实体，并利用差异度量选择性偏见。我们的结果表明，这种方法可以有效地识别选择性偏见，并用于发现容易受到偏见报道的话题。",
