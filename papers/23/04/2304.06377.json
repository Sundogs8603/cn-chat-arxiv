    "translated_abstract": "能够创造有意义的符号，并熟练地将它们用于更高的认知功能，如交流、推理、规划等，是人类智能的重要和独特之处。 目前，深度神经网络仍远远落后于人类创造符号进行这些高级认知功能的能力。本文提出了一种名为SEA-net的解决方案，使神经网络具有符号创造、语义理解和交流能力。SEA-net生成动态配置网络以执行特定任务的符号。这些符号捕捉了组成性语义信息，使系统能够通过纯符号操作或交流获得新功能。此外，我们发现这些自动生成的符号呈现出类似自然语言的内在结构，表明在人类大脑和人工神经网络中生成和理解符号的共同框架。我们希望这将成为将来发展人工智能的助推器。",
