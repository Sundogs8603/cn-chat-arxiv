While CS systems enjoy profuse advancements across multiple aspects, recent research fails to successfully incorporate feedback from the users. One of the main reasons for that is the lack of system-user conversational interaction data. To this end, we propose a user simulator-based framework for multi-turn interactions with a variety of mixed-initiative CS systems. Specifically, we develop a user simulator, dubbed ConvSim, that, once initialized with an information need description, is capable of providing feedback to a system's responses, as well as answering potential clarifying questions. Our experiments on a wide variety of state-of-the-art passage retrieval and neural re-ranking models show that effective utilization of user feedback can lead to 16% retrieval performance increase in terms of nDCG@3. Moreover, we observe consistent improvements as the n",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在探索评估用户反馈在混合倡议的会话式搜索系统中的各种方法。虽然会话式搜索系统在多个方面都取得了重大进展，但最近的研究未能成功地将用户反馈纳入系统中。其中一个主要原因是缺乏系统-用户对话交互数据。为此，我们提出了一种基于用户模拟器的框架，可用于与各种混合倡议的会话式搜索系统进行多轮交互。具体来说，我们开发了一个名为ConvSim的用户模拟器，一旦初始化了信息需求描述，就能够对系统的响应提供反馈，并回答潜在的澄清问题。我们对各种最先进的段落检索和神经重新排序模型进行的实验表明，有效利用用户反馈可以导致在nDCG@3方面16%的检索性能提高。此外，我们观察到随着n的增加，一致的改进。",
