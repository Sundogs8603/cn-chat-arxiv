    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统通常从项目集合中检索项目进行个性化推荐。然而，这种基于检索的推荐范式面临两个限制：1）语料库中的人工生成项目可能无法满足用户的多样化信息需求，2）用户通常通过点击等被动且低效的反馈方式调整推荐内容。近年来，人工智能生成内容在各个领域取得显著成功，具有克服这些限制的潜力：1）生成式人工智能可以生成个性化的内容以满足用户特定的信息需求，2）新兴的ChatGPT通过自然语言指令显著提高了用户准确表达信息需求的能力。在这种情况下，人工智能生成内容的大爆发指引我们走向下一代推荐范式，具有两个新的目标：1）通过生成式人工智能生成个性化内容，2）整合用户指令以指导由人工智能生成的内容。",
