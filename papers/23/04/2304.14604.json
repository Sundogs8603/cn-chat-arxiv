In order to suppress the noise, we suggest using the method of moments approach for both problems while introducing deep neural network priors. In particular, our neural networks should output the signals and the distribution of group elements, with moments being the input.

    "translated_abstract": "轨道恢复问题是一类经常出现的问题，有多种形式。在这些问题中，我们旨在在经过群作用扭曲并通过已知算子观察后，估计未知函数。通常情况下，观测值会受到非平凡水平的噪声污染。本文研究了两种特定的轨道恢复问题，即多参照面对齐和单颗粒冷冻电镜建模。为了抑制噪声，我们建议在两个问题中都使用矩法方法，并引入深度神经网络先验。特别地，我们的神经网络应输出信号和群元素的分布，而矩则为输入。在多参照面对齐的情况下，我们展示了使用神经网络提高从矩中重建信号的收敛速度的优势。最后，我们使用我们的方法重建了冷冻电镜模拟和生物体积。",
