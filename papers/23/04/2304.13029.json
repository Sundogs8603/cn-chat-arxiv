    "translated_abstract": "一篇研究论文在2017年比较了18个时间序列分类（TSC）算法在来自加州大学河滨分校（UCR）存档的85个数据集上的表现。这项研究通常被称为“烘焙比赛”，发现只有9个算法的表现显著优于使用的动态时间规整（DTW）和旋转森林基准。该研究通过从时间序列数据中提取特征的算法类型对每个算法进行分类，形成了五种主要算法类型的分类法。与可以重现结果的代码和结果的提供相结合，这些算法的分类和可访问的结果推动了TSC领域的普及。六年过去了，UCR存档已扩展到112个数据集，并且已经提出了大量新的算法。我们重访烘焙大赛，看看每个提出的类别自原始出版以来的进展，并评估新算法的性能。",
