This study proposes a design and implementation methodology of data-driven heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) control. Building thermodynamics is modeled using a symbolic regression model (SRM) built from the collected data. Additionally, an HVAC system model is also developed with a data-driven approach. A model predictive control (MPC) based HVAC scheduling is formulated with the developed models to minimize energy consumption and peak power demand and maximize thermal comfort.
