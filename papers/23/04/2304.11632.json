In this paper, we propose to enable humans and agents to collaborate through explicit communication by designing an efficient and interpretable Meta-Command Communication-based framework, dubbed MCC, for accomplishing effective human-agent collaboration in MOBA games. The MCC framework consists of two pivotal modules: 1) an interpretable communication protocol, i.e., the Meta-Command, to bridge the communication gap between humans and agents; 2) a meta-command value estimator, i.e., the Meta-Command Selector, to select a valuable meta-command for each agent to achieve effective h",

    "translated_abstract": "MOBA 游戏，如 Dota2 和王者荣耀，已经成为最近关于游戏人工智能研究的测试基地，迄今已经开发出了许多在人类水平上的人工智能系统。然而，这些人工智能系统主要集中在如何与人类竞争，而不是探索如何与人类合作。为此，本文首次尝试研究 MOBA 游戏中的人机协作。本文提出通过设计一种高效且可解释的基于元命令通信的框架（MCC），使人类和代理可以通过明确的通信协作，以实现在 MOBA 游戏中有效的人机协作。MCC 框架由两个关键模块组成：1）解释性通信协议，即元命令，以弥合人类和代理之间的通信差距；2）元命令值估计器，即元命令选择器，选择每个代理完成有效人机协作的有价值元命令。实验结果表明，我们提出的 MCC 框架可以有效地加快人机协作，并且 MCC 框架提供的可解释性通信机制有助于深入了解在 MOBA 游戏中人机协作的工作原理。",
