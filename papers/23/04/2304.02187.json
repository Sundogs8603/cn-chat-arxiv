    "title": "Bodily expressed emotion understanding through integrating Laban movement analysis. (arXiv:2304.02187v1 [cs.AI])",
    "abstract": "Body movements carry important information about a person's emotions or mental state and are essential in daily communication. Enhancing the ability of machines to understand emotions expressed through body language can improve the communication of assistive robots with children and elderly users, provide psychiatric professionals with quantitative diagnostic and prognostic assistance, and aid law enforcement in identifying deception. This study develops a high-quality human motor element dataset based on the Laban Movement Analysis movement coding system and utilizes that to jointly learn about motor elements and emotions. Our long-term ambition is to integrate knowledge from computing, psychology, and performing arts to enable automated understanding and analysis of emotion and mental state through body language. This work serves as a launchpad for further research into recognizing emotions through analysis of human movement.",

    "translated_abstract": "身体动作传递着人们情绪和精神状态的重要信息，是日常交流中必不可少的。增强机器理解身体语言表达的情绪能力可以提高辅助机器人与儿童和老年用户的交流，为精神科专业人员提供定量诊断和预后辅助，以及帮助执法机构识别欺骗行为。本研究开发了基于拉班动作分析运动编码系统的高质量人类运动要素数据集，并利用此数据集共同学习运动要素和情绪。我们的长期目标是整合计算机、心理学和表演艺术的知识，通过身体语言实现自动理解和分析情绪和精神状态。这项工作为进一步研究人类运动分析中的情绪识别提供了良好的起点。",
