    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）由于其提高精度和可扩展性的潜力而在高能物理（HEP）中受到关注。然而，它们的资源密集型特性和复杂的操作促使对对称等变的结构进行开发。在本文中，我们介绍了EuclidNet，这是一种新颖的对称等变GNN，适用于带电粒子跟踪。EuclidNet利用碰撞事件的图表示，并强制执行以探测器的束线轴为中心的旋转对称性，从而实现了更高效的模型。我们在TrackML数据集上将EuclidNet与最先进的Interaction Network进行基准测试，该数据集模拟预期在高亮度大型强子对撞机（HL-LHC）中出现的高堆叠条件。我们的结果表明，在小模型规模（<1000个参数）下，EuclidNet实现了接近最先进的性能，优于非等变基准。该研究为将来探索更具资源效率的带电粒子跟踪GNN模型铺平了道路。",
