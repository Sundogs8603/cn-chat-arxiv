    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于语法的自然语言机器人编程框架，特别用于拾取和放置任务。我们的方法使用自定义动作词典，设计了一种将共享意义的单词存储在一起的方式，从而通过从词汇数据库中添加更多动作词可以轻松扩展词汇量。我们使用搭载校准的手中相机和麦克风的Franka Panda机械臂，在模拟和实际实验中验证我们的自然语言机器人编程（NLRP）框架，要求参与者使用口头命令完成拾取和放置任务，将其转换为文本后通过NLRP框架处理，以获取机器人运动的关节空间轨迹。我们的结果表明，我们的方法具有很高的系统可用性评分。该框架的词典可以轻松扩展，无需依赖于迁移学习或大数据集。在未来，我们计划对不同的机器人平台和多个任务进行进一步验证。",
