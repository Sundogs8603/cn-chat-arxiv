    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个计算框架，用于以原子图字典的加权Wasserstein barycenters [99]，[101] 的形式对一组持久图进行简洁编码。我们引入了一种多尺度梯度下降方法，用于有效解决相应的最小化问题，该方法将Barycenter权重的优化与Atom图的优化交错进行。我们的方法利用了两个子问题梯度的解析表达式以确保快速迭代，并且还利用了共享内存并行性。对公共合奏的广泛实验证明了我们方法的有效性，最大示例的Wasserstein字典计算时间在数分钟之内。我们在两个应用中展示了我们的贡献的效用。首先，我们将Wassserstein字典应用于数据降维，并通过仅用其重量来紧凑地表示Persistence图来可靠地压缩它们。",
