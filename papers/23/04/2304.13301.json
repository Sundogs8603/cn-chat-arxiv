    "translated_abstract": "最近流行的大型语言模型（例如Codex、ChatGPT和GPT-4）在AI社区方面有了显著的进展，包括文本到SQL的任务。一些关于大型语言模型的评估和分析表明，它们有潜力生成SQL查询，但是它们所使用的提示设计不良（例如简单的结构或随机抽样）限制了大型语言模型的性能，并可能导致不必要或无关的输出。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了CBR-ApSQL，这是一个基于案例推理（CBR）的框架，与GPT-3.5相结合，用于在文本到SQL任务中对与案例相关和不相关的知识进行精确控制。我们设计了自适应提示，以灵活调整GPT-3.5的输入，其中涉及（1）通过去语义化输入问题来自适应检索案例，根据问题意图，以及（2）自适应回退机制，以确保提示的信息量和案例与提示之间的相关性。在去语义化阶段中，我们设计了Semantic D",
