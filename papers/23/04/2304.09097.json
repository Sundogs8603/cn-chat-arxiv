    "translated_abstract": "近年来，Graph神经网络在许多应用中得到了广泛应用，包括推荐系统。Graph神经网络对其他方法的优越性在于，推荐系统中的许多问题可以自然地建模为图，其中节点可以是用户或项目，边代表偏好关系。 在当前的Graph神经网络方法中，节点用在训练时学习到的静态向量表示。这种静态向量可能只适用于捕捉定义它们的一些用户或项目的微妙差别。为了克服这个限制，我们建议使用最近提出的启发范畴论的模型：Sheaf神经网络。Sheaf神经网络及其连接的拉普拉斯可以通过将每个节点（以及边）与向量空间而不是单个向量相关联来解决上述问题。向量空间表示更丰富，并允许在推理时选择正确的表示。这种方法使我们的模型更具表现力和灵活性，在几个基准推荐任务上实现了最先进的性能。",
