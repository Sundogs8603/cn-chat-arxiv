    "translated_abstract": "在最近的研究中，Lissovoi、Oliveto和Warwicker（《人工智能》（2023））证明了运动接受超启发式方法（MAHH）以显着的效率离开多峰悬崖基准的局部最优解。对于几乎所有悬崖宽度$d$，MAHH的$O(n^3)$运行时间大大优于简单精英进化算法（EAs）的$\\Theta(n^d)$运行时间。对于最主要的多峰基准跳跃函数，对于间隙大小$m\\geq 2$的运行时间估计为$O(n^{2m}m^{-\\Theta(m)})$和$\\Omega(2^{\\Omega(m)})$，两者的差距很大，MAHH的实际表现仍然是一个未解之谜。在本文中，我们解决了这个问题。我们证明了对于任何MAHH选择参数$p$的选择，MAHH在具有间隙大小$m = o(n^{1/2})$的跳跃函数上的预期运行时间至少为$\\Omega(n^{2m-1}/(2m-1)!)$。这使得MAHH比简单的精英进化算法更慢，后者通常有$O(n^m)$的运行时间。",
    "tldr": "MAHH方法通过解决跳跃函数在小的间隙大小下的表现问题，显着优于简单的精英进化算法。当处理宽悬崖问题时，MAHH仍然是解决局部最优解的高效方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "The Move Acceptance Hyper-Heuristic (MAHH) method performs significantly better than simple elitist evolutionary algorithms by addressing the performance issue of jump functions with small gap sizes. While dealing with wide cliffs, MAHH remains an efficient method for solving local optima."
