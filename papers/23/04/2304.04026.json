    "translated_abstract": "命名实体识别（NER）是一种基础的NLP任务，具有广泛的实际应用。目前最先进的NER方法的性能取决于高质量手动注释数据集，但对于一些语言仍不存在这样的数据集。在本文中，我们旨在通过引入WikiGoldSK来解决斯洛伐克语中这种情况，这是第一个具有可观规模的人工标记的斯洛伐克NER数据集。我们通过评估最先进的多语言预训练语言模型并将其与现有的银标准斯洛伐克语NER数据集进行比较来对其进行基准测试。我们还进行了少样本实验，并表明在银标准数据集上的训练能够产生更好的结果。为了支持未来基于斯洛伐克NER的研究，我们在https://github.com/NaiveNeuron/WikiGoldSK公开发布了数据集、代码和训练模型，采用可允许的许可条款。",
