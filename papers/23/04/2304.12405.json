    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种方法，用于综合动态的、降阶的输出反馈多项式控制器，应用于控制仿射的非线性系统，并使用学习的感知模块和视觉观测来保证在反馈控制循环中稳定地运行到目标状态。我们利用Lyapunov分析来制定综合这种策略的问题。该问题在策略参数和用于证明策略稳定性的Lyapunov函数方面是非凸的。为了近似地解决这个问题，我们提出了两种方法：第一种解决了一系列平方和优化问题，以迭代改进一个通过构造可证明的稳定策略，而第二种则直接对多项式策略的参数进行基于梯度的优化，并在后验上验证其闭环稳定性。我们扩展了我们的方法，以在观测噪声存在的情况下提供稳定性保证，该情况实际上是由于观测误差而引起的。",
