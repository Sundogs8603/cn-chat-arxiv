Methodologically we utilize affective word embeddings to look at the affective distribution in different text segments. We also present a simple yet efficient and effective method of enhancing emotion lexicons to take both semantic shift and the domain of the text into account producing real-world congruent results closely matching both contemporary and modern qualitative analyses.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出使用情感作为文学文本情绪的代理。在这项研究中，我们探讨了在计算情感与检测情绪之间的区别。从方法论的角度，我们利用情感词嵌入来观察不同文本段落中的情感分布。我们还提出了一种简单而有效的方法，用于增强情感词典，考虑了语义转移和文本领域，从而产生了与当代和现代定性分析密切匹配的现实世界一致的结果。",
    "tldr": "该研究提出使用情感作为文学文本情绪的代理，并能通过扩展情感词典在考虑文本语义转移和领域的前提下，提供近期和现代分析的实际可行结果。",
