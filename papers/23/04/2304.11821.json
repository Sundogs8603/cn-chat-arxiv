    "abstract": "arXiv:2304.11821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Cooperative perception can significantly improve the perception performance of autonomous vehicles beyond the limited perception ability of individual vehicles by exchanging information with neighbor agents through V2X communication. However, most existing work assume ideal communication among agents, ignoring the significant and common \\textit{interruption issues} caused by imperfect V2X communication, where cooperation agents can not receive cooperative messages successfully and thus fail to achieve cooperative perception, leading to safety risks. To fully reap the benefits of cooperative perception in practice, we propose V2X communication INterruption-aware COoperative Perception (V2X-INCOP), a cooperative perception system robust to communication interruption for V2X communication-aided autonomous driving, which leverages historical cooperation information to recover missing information due to the interruptions and allevia",
