    "abstract": "Wikipedia is one of the most successful collaborative projects in history. It is the largest encyclopedia ever created, with millions of users worldwide relying on it as the first source of information as well as for fact-checking and in-depth research. As Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of its volunteer-editors, its success might be particularly affected by toxic speech. In this paper, we analyze all 57 million comments made on user talk pages of 8.5 million editors across the six most active language editions of Wikipedia to study the potential impact of toxicity on editors' behaviour. We find that toxic comments consistently reduce the activity of editors, leading to an estimated loss of 0.5-2 active days per user in the short term. This amounts to multiple human-years of lost productivity when considering the number of active contributors to Wikipedia. The effects of toxic comments are even greater in the long term, as they significantly increase the risk of editors leaving ",

    "translated_abstract": "维基百科是历史上最成功的协作项目之一，是有史以来最大的百科全书，全球数百万用户依赖它作为信息和事实核查以及深入研究的第一来源。由于维基百科完全依赖其志愿编辑的努力，因此影响到编辑的毒性言论可能特别显着。在本文中，我们分析了六种最活跃的维基百科语言版本中8.5万名编辑的用户对话页面上发表的5700万条评论，以研究毒性对编辑行为的潜在影响。我们发现，毒性评论不断降低编辑的活跃程度，导致每个用户在短期内的活跃天数估计损失0.5-2天。考虑到维基百科的活跃贡献者数量，这相当于多年的人力成果损失。毒性评论的影响在长期更为显著，因为它们显着增加了编辑离开的风险。",
