    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的框架，将大型语言模型（LLM），数字孪生和工业自动化系统结合起来，实现生产过程的智能规划和控制。我们的方法涉及开发包含生产描述信息的数字孪生系统，并将自动化系统改造为提供统一接口的细粒度功能或模块，以供自动化组件或模块执行。随后，设计LLM代理来解释数字孪生中的描述性信息，并通过RESTful接口控制物理系统。这些LLM代理作为自动化系统内的智能代理，实现了灵活生产的自主规划和控制。给定一个任务指令作为输入，LLM代理协调一系列原子功能和技能来完成任务。我们展示了我们实现的原型如何处理未预定义的任务，并计划生产过程。",
