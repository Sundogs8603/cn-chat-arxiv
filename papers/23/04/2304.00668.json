    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习在SAR ATR中被广泛使用，并在MSTAR数据集上取得了优异的性能。然而，由于受限的成像条件，MSTAR存在背景相关等数据偏见，即背景杂波特性与目标类别存在虚假相关性。深度学习可以过度拟合杂波以减少训练误差。因此，杂波的过度拟合程度反映了SAR ATR中深度学习的非因果性。现有方法仅定性分析此现象。本文基于Shapley值量化不同区域对目标识别的贡献。杂波的Shapley值可以衡量其过度拟合程度。此外，我们解释了数据偏差和模型偏差对非因果性的影响。简言之，数据偏差导致训练集和测试集中的信杂比和杂波纹理可比，而各种模型结构对这些偏差的过拟合程度不同。非因果性的解释为提高深度学习在SAR ATR中的鲁棒性和泛化能力提供了重要的见解。",
