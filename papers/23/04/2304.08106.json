    "translated_abstract": "随着全球2020年近100万例头颈癌的新发病例，头颈癌是一种致命且常见的恶性疾病。由于病变出现在多个位置以及患者之间的治疗效果差异，治疗决策和治疗本身带来了挑战。因此，自动分割和预后估计方法可以帮助确保每位患者得到最有效的治疗。本文提出了一个框架，在任意视野(FOV) PET和CT注册扫描上执行这些功能，从而作为VokCow团队参加了HECKTOR 2022挑战的任务1和任务2。该方法分为三个阶段：定位、分割和生存预测。首先，将任意FOV的扫描裁剪到头颈区域，并使用一个U形卷积神经网络(CNN)来训练分割感兴趣区域。然后，使用获得的区域，将另一个CNN与支持向量机分类器相结合，以获取语义分割结果",
