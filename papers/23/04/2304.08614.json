    "abstract": "This paper presents the approach and results of USC SAIL's submission to the Signal Processing Grand Challenge 2023 - e-Prevention (Task 2), on detecting relapses in psychotic patients. Relapse prediction has proven to be challenging, primarily due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and responses to treatment between individuals. We address these challenges by investigating the use of sleep behavior features to estimate relapse days as outliers in an unsupervised machine learning setting. We extract informative features from human activity and heart rate data collected in the wild, and evaluate various combinations of feature types and time resolutions. We found that short-time sleep behavior features outperformed their awake counterparts and larger time intervals. Our submission was ranked 3rd in the Task's official leaderboard, demonstrating the potential of such features as an objective and non-invasive predictor of psychotic relapses.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了USC SAIL提出的在信号处理大挑战2023——电子预防（任务2）中，检测精神病患者复发的方法和结果。复发预测一直是具有挑战性的，主要由于不同个体症状和对治疗的反应的异质性。我们通过研究利用睡眠行为特征估计异常值的无监督机器学习设置来解决这些挑战。我们从野外采集的人类活动和心率数据中提取有用的特征，并评估了各种特征类型和时间分辨率的组合。我们发现，短时睡眠行为特征表现出比其清醒的同行和更大的时间间隔更好的性能。我们的提交在任务的官方排行榜上排名第三，展示了这些特征作为精神病复发的客观且非侵入性的预测指标的潜力。",
