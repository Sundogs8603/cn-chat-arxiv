    "abstract": "Recent approaches have attempted to personalize dialogue systems by leveraging profile information into models. However, this knowledge is scarce and difficult to obtain, which makes the extraction/generation of profile information from dialogues a fundamental asset. To surpass this limitation, we introduce the Profile Generation Task (PGTask). We contribute with a new dataset for this problem, comprising profile sentences aligned with related utterances, extracted from a corpus of dialogues. Furthermore, using state-of-the-art methods, we provide a benchmark for profile generation on this novel dataset. Our experiments disclose the challenges of profile generation, and we hope that this introduces a new research direction.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究尝试通过将个人资料信息融入模型来个性化对话系统。然而，这种知识信息稀少且难以获取，这使得从对话中提取/生成个人资料信息成为一项基本需求。为了克服这一限制，我们引入了档案生成任务（PGTask）。我们为此问题提供了一个新的数据集，其中包括与相关话语对齐的档案句子，从对话语料库中提取。此外，利用最先进的方法，我们为这个新数据集提供了一个档案生成的基准。我们的实验揭示了档案生成的挑战，并希望这引入了一个新的研究方向。",
