    "translated_abstract": "对话中的响应排序在检索型会话系统中起着关键作用。在多轮对话中，为了捕捉对话的要点，上下文信息作为重要的知识至关重要。本文提出了一个灵活的神经框架，可以整合来自多个渠道的上下文信息。特别是针对当前任务，我们的方法是提供两个信息通道并行，即将与候选来源相关的 Conversational History（对话历史）和 Domain Knowledge（领域知识）融合在一起，作为上下文信息以提高多轮对话响应排序的表现。所提出的方法可以通用于将其他上下文目标任务的各种上下文特征纳入模块中。我们在广泛用于评估会话响应排名任务的 MSDialog 数据集上评估了我们的模型。实验结果显示，我们的框架显着优于其他最先进的方法。",
