    "translated_abstract": "无标签模型评估旨在在不依赖于真实标签的情况下预测模型在各种测试集上的性能。这篇文章介绍了我们针对CVPR 2023 Visual Dataset Understanding研讨会的第一个DataCV挑战的解决方案。首先，我们提出了一种名为K-means聚类特征一致性对齐（KCFCA）的新方法，该方法旨在处理各种数据集的分布偏移。KCFCA利用K-means算法来聚类标记的训练集和无标签的测试集，然后通过特征一致性来对齐聚类中心。其次，我们开发了一种动态回归模型来捕捉分布偏移和模型准确性之间的关系。第三，我们设计了一个算法来发现异常模型因素，排除异常模型，并结合多个自动评估模型的优点。",
