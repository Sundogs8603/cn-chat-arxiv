Given the huge amount of news articles published each day, most of which are neutral, we present a systematic news screening method to identify the ``true'' impactful ones, aiming for more effective development of news sentiment learning methods. Based on several liquidity-driven variables, including volatility, turnover, bid-ask spread, and book size, we associate each 5-min time bin to one of two specific liquidity modes. One represents the ``calm'' state at which the market stays for most of the time and the other, featured with relatively higher levels of volatility and trading volume, describes the regime driven by some exogenous events. Then we focus on the moments where the liquidity mode switches from the former to the latter and consider the news articles published nearby impactful. We apply naive Bayes on these ",

    "translated_abstract": "新闻可以传达对金融资产看跌或看涨的观点。机构投资者需要基于文本数据自动评估隐含的新闻情绪。鉴于每天发布的大量新闻文章中，大多数都是中性的，我们提出了一种系统化的新闻筛选方法，以识别“真正”有影响力的新闻，旨在更有效地开发新闻情绪学习方法。基于几个由流动性驱动的变量，包括波动性、成交量、买卖价差和成交额，我们将每个5分钟时间段与两种特定的流动性模式之一相关联。其中一个代表市场在大部分时间停留在“平静”状态，而另一个则以相对较高的波动率和交易量为特征，描述受某些外生事件驱动的情况。然后，我们关注流动性模式从前者切换到后者的时刻，并考虑附近发布的新闻文章具有影响力。我们在这些文章上应用朴素贝叶斯方法。",
