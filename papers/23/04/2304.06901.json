    "translated_abstract": "机器学习算法在越来越多的场景中用于做出或支持决策。随着广泛使用，对这种方法的公平性也日益关注。以前关于算法公平性的文献广泛探讨了风险，并且在许多情况下提出了管理某些风险的方法。然而，大多数研究都集中在由单个决策制定者或代理人引起的公平性问题上。相反，大多数现实系统都有许多代理人，他们共同作为更大生态系统的一部分工作。例如，在贷款场景中，有多个放贷人评估申请者的贷款，同时还有决策制定者和其他机构其决策也会影响结果。因此，单个决策制定者做出的任何放贷决策的更广泛影响可能取决于生态系统中多个不同代理人的行动。本文为企业和系统公平性开发了形式主义，并呼吁算法公平性文献更加关注后者。",
