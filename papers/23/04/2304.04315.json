    "translated_abstract": "微震源成像在被动地震监测中起着重要作用，但由于稀疏的测量数据容易出现混叠问题，导致其常常失败。因此，我们提出了一种基于物理知识约束的神经网络（PINN）的直接微震成像框架，它可以生成聚焦的源图像，即使只有极少的记录。我们使用PINNs表示多频波场，然后应用逆傅里叶变换来提取源图像。特别地，我们通过硬约束来修改频域波场的表示形式，从而本质上满足边界条件（表层上的测量数据），避免了在PINNs中平衡数据和PDE损失的困难。此外，我们提出了关于深度的因果性损失实现，以提高PINNs的收敛性。在Overthrust模型上的数值实验表明，该方法可以产生可靠且精确的结果。",
