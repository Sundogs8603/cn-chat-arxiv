    "translated_abstract": "在科学人工智能领域，面对真实世界问题中的有限标记数据始终是一个重要的挑战。目前的方法是在大型未标记语料库上预训练强力的任务无关模型，但在向下游任务转移知识方面可能存在困难。在本研究中，我们提出了InstructBio，一种半监督学习算法，更好地利用未标记的样例。它引入教练模型来提供伪标签可靠性的置信度比率。这些置信度分数然后指导目标模型对不同的数据点给予明显的关注，避免对标记数据的过度依赖以及不正确的伪注释的负面影响。全面的实验表明，InstructBio显著提高了分子模型的泛化能力，不仅在分子属性预测方面，在活性悬崖估计方面也表现出优越性。",
