The predominant grading rule is simple averaging, i.e., calculating grades by averaging scores on the questions each student is asked, which is fair ex-ante, over the randomized questions, but not fair ex-post, on the realized questions. The fair grading problem is to estimate the average grade of each student on the full question bank. The maximum-likelihood estimator for the Bradley-Terry-Luce model on the bipartite student-question graph is shown to be consistent with high probability when the number of questions asked to each student is at least the cubed-logarithm of the number of students. In an empirical study on exam data and in simulations, our algorithm based on the maximum-likelihood estimator significantly outperforms simple averaging in prediction accuracy and ex-post fairness even with a small class and exam",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了随机考试的评分算法。在随机考试中，每个学生需回答来自较大题库的随机题目，评分规则通常采用简单平均的方式，即计算每个学生回答的题目得分的平均值。虽然这种方式在随机选择题目时是公平的，但在具体答题情境中并不公平。公平评分问题是要评估每个学生在全题库上的平均成绩。本文使用的Maximal-margin algorithm可用于传统的Bradley-Terry-Luce模型。经过实证研究和模拟验证，在小班级和考试的精度和公平性方面，我们的评分算法明显优于简单平均方法。",

The algorithm, called Maximal-margin, is shown to outperform simple averaging in prediction accuracy and ex-post fairness in both empirical and simulated studies."
