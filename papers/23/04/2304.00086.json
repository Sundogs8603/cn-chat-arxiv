    "title": "Machine Learning for Economics Research: When What and How?. (arXiv:2304.00086v1 [econ.GN])",
    "abstract": "This article provides a curated review of selected papers published in prominent economics journals that use machine learning (ML) tools for research and policy analysis. The review focuses on three key questions: (1) when ML is used in economics, (2) what ML models are commonly preferred, and (3) how they are used for economic applications. The review highlights that ML is particularly used in processing nontraditional and unstructured data, capturing strong nonlinearity, and improving prediction accuracy. Deep learning models are suitable for nontraditional data, whereas ensemble learning models are preferred for traditional datasets. While traditional econometric models may suffice for analyzing low-complexity data, the increasing complexity of economic data due to rapid digitalization and the growing literature suggest that ML is becoming an essential addition to the econometrician's toolbox.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文对使用机器学习工具进行经济学研究和政策分析的重要经济期刊上发表的文章进行了精选综述。综述回答了三个关键问题：（1）何时在经济学中使用机器学习，（2）常用的机器学习模型是什么，以及（3）如何将它们用于经济应用。综述强调了机器学习特别适用于处理非传统和非结构化数据、捕捉强非线性性和提高预测准确性。深度学习模型适用于非传统数据，而集成学习模型适用于传统数据集。尽管传统的计量经济学模型在分析低复杂性数据时可能足够，但由于快速数字化和不断增长的文献，经济数据的复杂性增加，机器学习正成为计量经济学家工具箱中不可或缺的一部分。",
