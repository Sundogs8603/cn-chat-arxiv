    "translated_abstract": "最近的对话语言模型有一个激动人心的能力，即能够独立地搜索相关信息，以确定给定对话的响应。然而，获取用于教导模型如何发出搜索查询的训练数据是耗费时间和资源的。在本文中，我们提出了q2d：一种自动生成从问题中获取信息的对话的数据生成流水线。我们提供给一个大型的语言模型（PaLM）来创建问答数据集的对话版本，并使用它来改进与外部搜索API通信以确定对话响应的查询生成模型。与先前依赖于人类编写的带有搜索查询的对话的方法不同，我们的方法允许自动生成基于查询的对话，从而实现更好的控制和规模。我们的实验表明：（1）针对QReCC数据集的查询生成，使用我们的合成数据训练的模型实现了从MNLI中进行传输学习的模型性能的90%--97%，而使用人工标注的查询生成数据训练的模型实现了91%--96%的性能。（2）针对QUAC和CoQA数据集的基础响应选择，使用我们自动生成的对话训练的模型性能仅比使用带有搜索查询的人类生成的对话训练的模型性能低了0.8-2.2％。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes the q2d approach, which teaches models how to issue search queries by automatically generating query-based grounded dialogs. The experiments show that the models trained on the q2d-generated data achieved performance close to those trained on human-labeled data, with better control and scalability."
