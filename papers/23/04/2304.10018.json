    "abstract": "With the advances of IoT developments, copious sensor data are communicated through wireless networks and create the opportunity of building Digital Twins to mirror and simulate the complex physical world. Digital Twin has long been believed to rely heavily on domain knowledge, but we argue that this leads to a high barrier of entry and slow development due to the scarcity and cost of human experts. In this paper, we propose Digital Twin Graph (DTG), a general data structure associated with a processing framework that constructs digital twins in a fully automated and domain-agnostic manner. This work represents the first effort that takes a completely data-driven and (unconventional) graph learning approach to addresses key digital twin challenges.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着物联网技术的发展，海量的传感器数据通过无线网络通信，创造了构建数字孪生以反映和模拟复杂物理世界的机会。长期以来，数字孪生被认为严重依赖于领域知识，但我们认为这导致了高门槛和缓慢的开发，因为人工专家稀缺和成本昂贵。在本文中，我们提出了数字孪生图(DTG)，这是一个与处理框架相关联的通用数据结构，可以以完全自动化和领域无关的方式构建数字孪生。这项工作代表了首次尝试采用完全数据驱动和（非传统的）图学习方法来解决数字孪生的关键挑战。",
