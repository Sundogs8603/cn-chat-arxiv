    "abstract": "In material characterization, identifying defective areas on a material surface is fundamental. The conventional approach involves measuring the relevant physical properties point-by-point at the predetermined mesh grid points on the surface and determining the area at which the property does not reach the desired level. To identify defective areas more efficiently, we propose adaptive mapping methods in which measurement resources are used preferentially to detect the boundaries of defective areas. We interpret this problem as an active-learning (AL) of the level set estimation (LSE) problem. The goal of AL-based LSE is to determine the level set of the physical property function defined on the surface with as small number of measurements as possible. Furthermore, to handle the situations in which materials with similar specifications are repeatedly produced, we introduce a transfer learning approach so that the information of previously produced materials can be effectively utilized.",

    "translated_abstract": "在材料表征中，识别物体表面上的缺陷区域是基础性的任务。传统的方法是在表面预设的网格点上逐点测量相关物理量，并确定未达到期望水平的区域。为了更高效地识别缺陷区域，我们提出了自适应映射方法，该方法优先使用测量资源来检测缺陷区域的边界。我们将该问题视为水平集估计问题的主动学习领域。基于主动学习的水平集估计的目标是以尽可能少的测量次数来确定定义在表面上的物理函数的水平集。此外，为了处理重复生产具有相似规格的材料的情况，我们引入了一种迁移学习方法，以便有效利用先前生产的材料的信息。",
