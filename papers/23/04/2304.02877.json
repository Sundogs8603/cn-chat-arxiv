    "translated_abstract": "在开源软件项目中，用所需技能来标记问题可以帮助贡献者选择任务。然而，手动标记问题耗时且容易出错，而当前的自动化方法大多仅限于将问题分类为错误/非错误。我们调查自动标记问题为我们所谓的“API领域”的可行性和相关性，这些领域是API的高级类别。因此，我们认为受问题影响的源代码中使用的API可以作为工作问题所需技能（例如DB、安全性、UI）的代理。我们进行了一个用户研究（n=74）来评估API领域标签对潜在贡献者的相关性，利用问题描述和项目历史来建立预测模型，并验证了贡献者（n=20）对项目的预测结果。我们的研究结果显示：（i）项目新手认为API领域标签在选择任务时有用，（ii）可以预测标签的准确率高达60％，（iii）贡献者发现自动分配的标签有助于理解问题的要求。",
