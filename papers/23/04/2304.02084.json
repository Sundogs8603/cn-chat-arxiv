    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个用于揭示赫库兰尼姆纸草卷隐藏文本的完整软件管道。这个增强的虚拟展开流水线将机器学习与一种新颖的几何框架相结合，将三维和二维图像联系起来。我们还提出了EduceLab-Scrolls，这是一个全面的开放数据集，代表了二十年来对这个问题的研究努力。EduceLab-Scrolls包含了一组小碎片和完整卷轴的体积X射线CT图像。该数据集还包含用于监督训练油墨检测模型的二维图像标签。通过将卷轴碎片的频谱照片与相同碎片的X射线CT图像对准，从而创建了一个可机器学习的图像空间和模态之间的映射。这种对准允许有监督地学习检测X射线CT中“隐形”碳墨的任务，即使对于人类专家标记者来说也是“不可能”的任务。据我们所知，这是第一个对齐数据集。",
