    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了乌拉圭不同生育阶段妇女生育率的决定因素。为此，我们运用时间序列分析方法，基于1968年至2021年的数据和基于1984年至2019年的部门级统计信息的面板数据技术。我们的第一次计量经济学实验结果显示了生育率与经济表现、教育和婴儿死亡率之间的协整关系，不同的生殖阶段观察到差异。我们发现对于20岁至29岁的女性，收入与生育率呈负相关，这个结果在30岁以上的女性中仍然存在。这个结果表明，对于这个年龄组的女性来说，生孩子被看作是一种机会成本。我们也观察到教育与青少年生育率之间存在负相关关系，这对公共政策的设计有着重要意义。通过计量经济学技术控制未观察到的异质性的面板数据分析，证实了我么的第一次实验结果。",
    "tldr": "研究发现，乌拉圭妇女在不同生殖阶段的生育率受到经济表现、教育和婴儿死亡率的影响。20岁至29岁女性的收入与生育率呈负相关；教育与青少年生育率呈负相关。需要制定相应的公共政策。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper examines the determinants of fertility among women at different stages of their reproductive lives in Uruguay. Results show that fertility is influenced by economic performance, education, and infant mortality. There is a negative correlation between income and fertility for women aged 20-29 and between education and adolescent fertility. This has implications for policy making."
