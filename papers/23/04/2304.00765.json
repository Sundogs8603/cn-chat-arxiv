    "title": "Managing power grids through topology actions: A comparative study between advanced rule-based and reinforcement learning agents. (arXiv:2304.00765v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)",
    "abstract": "The operation of electricity grids has become increasingly complex due to the current upheaval and the increase in renewable energy production. As a consequence, active grid management is reaching its limits with conventional approaches. In the context of the Learning to Run a Power Network challenge, it has been shown that Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an efficient and reliable approach with considerable potential for automatic grid operation. In this article, we analyse the submitted agent from Binbinchen and provide novel strategies to improve the agent, both for the RL and the rule-based approach. The main improvement is a N-1 strategy, where we consider topology actions that keep the grid stable, even if one line is disconnected. More, we also propose a topology reversion to the original grid, which proved to be beneficial. The improvements are tested against reference approaches on the challenge test sets and are able to increase the performance of the rule-based agent by 27%. I",

    "translated_abstract": "由于当前形势的动荡和可再生能源生产的增加，电力网络运行变得越来越复杂。因此，传统方法的主动网格管理已经达到了极限。通过“学习运行电力网络”挑战，我们发现增强学习是一种有效可靠的自动化网格运行方法。本文分析了Binbinchen提交的代理，并提供了改进强化学习和基于规则方法的新策略。主要的改进是N-1策略，即考虑到在某条线路断开时，仍可保持网络稳定的拓扑操作。此外，我们还提出了将拓扑结构恢复到原始状态的拓扑反转，证明其有益。基于我们的改进方法，在挑战测试集上，我们的方法能够使基于规则的智能体性能提高27％。",
