    "translated_abstract": "随着去中心化金融的爆发式发展，我们目睹了各种资产的代币化，包括股权、基金、债务和房地产等。利用区块链技术，数字资产被广泛分为可互换和非可互换代币（NFT）。在这里，非同质化代币是指具有独特且不可替代属性的代币。 NFT已广受关注，其协议、标准和应用正在呈指数级发展。它已成功应用于数字幻想艺术品、游戏、藏品等。然而，在诸如知识产权等问题上，利用NFT的研究尚不足够。申请专利和商标不仅是一个耗时费力的过程，而且成本高昂。 NFT在知识产权领域具有 considerable（大小可观） 的潜力。它可以促进透明度和流动性，并向旨在高效商业化他们的发明的创新者开放市场。本文的主要目的是探讨以专利和知识产权资产的非同质化代币化作为NFT的关键技术和挑战。",
