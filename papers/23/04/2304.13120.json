    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个实验方案,用于在快速的异位同位素上进行敏感、高精度的激光光谱学研究。通过在电场内诱导原子的逐步共振电离,然后检测离子和相应的电子,可以进行时间和位置敏感的结果粒子的测量。使用混合密度网络 (MDN),我们可以利用这些信息对单个原子的初始能量进行预测,从而在事件逐事件的基础上应用多普勒修正所观察到的跃迁频率。我们对该提议的实验方案进行数值模拟,并表明可以实现kHz级别的不确定性,对在极端温度 ($> 10^8$ K) 下产生的离子束进行，在能量分散最大可达10 keV和速度分布不均匀的情况下。能够直接在高能束上进行飞行谱学研究,为研究短寿命的离子的物理和化学性质提供了独特的机会。",
