    "translated_abstract": "目前，基于传感器的人体活动识别已经成为了穿戴设备和移动设备上应用广泛的方法，监督深度学习模型是目前领先的方法。然而，训练这些模型需要大量标记数据，采集这些数据通常是耗时、昂贵且容易出错的。与此同时，由于活动执行的内部和外部可变性，活动模型应该为每个用户个性化设计。本文提出了SelfAct：一种新的用于缓解这些问题的人体活动识别框架，它结合自监督和主动学习。SelfAct利用从许多用户收集的大量未标记数据进行自我监督预训练深度学习模型，以学习有意义、高效的传感器数据的潜在表示。由此得出的预训练模型可以被新用户当地使用，他们将通过一种新的无监督主动学习策略来微调这个模型。我们在两个公开可用的人体活动识别数据集上的实验表明，SelfAct在准确性和模型效率方面都取得了优异的表现。",
