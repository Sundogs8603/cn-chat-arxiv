    "translated_abstract": "深度度量学习技术已应用于各种监督和无监督学习任务，通过深度网络学习样本嵌入来进行视觉表示。然而，经典方法采用固定距离度量作为两个嵌入之间的相似性函数，可能导致捕捉复杂数据分布的亚最优性能。Bregman散度概括了各种距离度量的度量，并在许多深度度量学习领域中产生。本文首先展示了如何从Bregman散度获得深度度量学习损失。然后，我们介绍了一种直接从数据中学习经验Bregman散度的新方法，通过使用深度学习设置对Bregman散度下的凸函数进行参数化。我们进一步实验证明，与其他SOTA深度度量学习方法相比，我们的方法在五个流行公共数据集上表现出色，特别是在模式识别和聚类任务上。",
