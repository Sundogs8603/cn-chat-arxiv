    "translated_abstract": "人-物交互对于人类中心的场景理解应用，如人类中心的视觉生成、AR/VR和机器人技术至关重要。本文提出了一种组合式的视角来解决人物-物体交互动画的挑战，即通过新的姿势序列，动画化新的人物和/或新的物体的新的交互行为。具体而言，我们采用神经人物-物体变形来建模和渲染基于隐式神经表示的HOI动态。为了使人物和物体之间的交互姿势在不同的人物和物体之间转移，我们设计了一种新的组合式条件神经辐射场(CC-NeRF)，该方法使用潜在码将人物和物体之间的相互依赖关系解耦，以实现新的HOI的组合式动画控制。实验证明，所提出的方法可以很好地推广到各种新的HOI动画设置中。",
