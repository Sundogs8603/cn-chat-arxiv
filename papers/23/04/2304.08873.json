    "translated_abstract": "会话推荐系统（SBRS）在当前电子商务和流媒体推荐场景中更适用，因此成为了热门话题。SBRS遇到的数据通常非常稀疏，也是限制推荐准确度的瓶颈之一。因此，对比学习（CL）在SBRS中应用，因为它能够在稀疏数据条件下改善嵌入学习。然而，现有的CL策略在强制执行更细粒度（例如，因素级）比较方面能力有限，因此无法捕捉实例之间的微小差异。除此之外，这些策略通常使用项目或片段随机删除作为数据增强的手段，可能导致数据更稀疏，从而无效地自我监督信号。通过解决上述两个限制，我们引入了一种新的多粒度CL框架。具体而言，我们将具有双重粒度的两个额外的嵌入卷积通道合并到网络中，使网络能够学习会话的本地项目和全局因素信息的共享和判别表示。我们还提出了一种新的CL策略，使用自我监督的重要性加权来强制执行细粒度比较。在两个真实世界数据集上进行的大量实验表明，我们提出的方法优于现有最先进的方法，并且能够有效地捕捉会话之间的微小差异。",
