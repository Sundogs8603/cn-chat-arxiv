    "translated_abstract": "对话行为可以代表在辅导对话期间发生的教练员或学生的对话动作。在教育对话中自动识别对话行为对于基于对话的智能辅导系统的设计是重要的。许多先前的研究采用机器学习模型对辅导对话中的对话行为进行分类，并投入大量精力使用有限的训练数据（即低资源数据场景）来优化分类准确性。然而，除了分类准确性之外，分类器的鲁棒性也很重要，这可以反映分类器学习不同类别分布的模式的能力。我们注意到，许多先前的教育对话行为分类研究采用交叉熵（CE）损失来优化低资源数据中的DA分类器。这些研究中的DA分类器往往以牺牲少数类的代价来优先考虑大多数类的准确性，从而可能导致在少数类上性能差。在这篇论文中，我们提出了一种新型的DA分类器MIREX，它采用互信息最小化损失来提高DA分类器在不平衡和低资源数据情景下的鲁棒性。实验结果表明，MIREX在不平衡和低资源的DA数据集上优于现有方法。",
