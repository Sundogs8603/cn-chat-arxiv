    "translated_abstract": "因果关系数据集在推动因果学领域方面起着至关重要的作用。然而，现有数据集往往缺乏真实世界问题的复杂性，如选择偏差、不忠实数据和混淆。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了一个新的合成因果数据集，即结构复杂、具有附加父因果关系的SCARY数据集，它包括以下特征。数据集包括40个场景，每个场景生成3个不同的种子，使研究人员能够利用相关数据子集。此外，我们使用两种不同的数据生成机制来生成父节点和子节点之间的因果关系，包括线性和混合因果机制以及多个子类型。我们的数据集生成器受到因果发现工具箱的启发，仅生成加性模型。数据集的Varsortability为0.5。我们的SCARY数据集为研究人员在更现实的场景下探索因果发现提供了一个有价值的资源。",
