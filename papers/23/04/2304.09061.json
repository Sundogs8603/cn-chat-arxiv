    "translated_abstract": "音乐流媒体服务通常旨在推荐歌曲以扩展用户在该服务上创建的播放列表。然而，在保留其音乐特征和符合用户倾向的情况下扩展播放列表仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务，通常被称为自动播放列表延续（APC）。此外，尽管这些服务经常需要在大型目录中实时选择最佳歌曲进行推荐，但最近关于APC的研究主要集中在具有少量可扩展性保证并在相对较小的数据集上进行评估的模型上。在本文中，我们介绍了一个通用框架，用于构建适用于大规模应用的可扩展但有效的APC模型。基于表示-聚合策略，它通过设计确保可扩展性，同时足够灵活，可以包含各种表示学习和序列建模技术，例如基于Transformer。我们通过在不同数据集和情况下的实验证明了该框架的相关性。",
