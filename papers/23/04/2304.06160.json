    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一个系统需要满足信号时序逻辑(STL)规范的神经网络控制器学习问题。我们利用STL的定量语义来定义鲁棒满足的概念。确保神经网络控制器的正确性，即保证被控制的系统满足规范，是一个近期受到广泛关注的难题。我们提供了一个通用的过程来构造一组可训练的高阶控制障碍函数(HOCBFs)，强制执行STL中某一片段的公式的满足。我们使用BarrierNet作为神经网络控制器的最后一层，实现了具有控制障碍函数限制的可微分二次规划(dQP)，以保证STL公式的满足。我们一起训练HOCBF和其他神经网络参数以进一步提高控制器的鲁棒性。仿真结果表明，与现有方法相比，我们的方法保证了STL规范的满足，并对扰动更具鲁棒性。",
