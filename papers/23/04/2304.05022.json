    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common and dangerous cancers in women, while it can also afflict men. Breast cancer treatment and detection are greatly aided by the use of histopathological images since they contain sufficient phenotypic data. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) is commonly employed to improve accuracy and breast cancer detection. In our research, we have analyzed pre-trained deep transfer learning models such as ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, and VGG19 for detecting breast cancer using the 2453 histopathology images dataset. Images in the dataset were separated into two categories: those with invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and those without IDC. After analyzing the transfer learning model, we found that ResNet50 outperformed other models, achieving accuracy rates of 90.2%, Area under Curve (AUC) rates of 90.0%, recall rates of 94.7%, and a marginal loss of 3.5%.",

    "translated_abstract": "乳腺癌是妇女中最常见和最危险的癌症之一，也可能影响男性。使用组织病理学图像可以极大地提高乳腺癌治疗和检测的准确率，因为它们包含足够的表型数据。深度神经网络（DNN）通常用于提高乳腺癌检测的准确性。在我们的研究中，我们分析了 ResNet50、ResNet101、VGG16 和 VGG19 等预训练的深度迁移学习模型，用于检测包含 2453 个组织病理学图像数据集的乳腺癌。数据集中的图像被分为含有浸润性导管癌（IDC）和不含 IDC 两类。在对迁移学习模型进行分析后，我们发现 ResNet50 优于其他模型，在准确率为 90.2%、曲线下面积（AUC）为 90.0%、召回率为 94.7% 和小 margin 损失率为 3.5%。",
