    "translated_abstract": "注意力缺陷多动障碍 (ADHD)是世界范围内常见的神经行为障碍。尽管对于机器学习方法在ADHD诊断上的研究非常广泛，但大多数研究都依赖于高成本设备，例如MRI机器和EEG贴片。因此，基于ADHD行为特征的低成本诊断方法备受期待。基于骨架的动作识别由于其聚焦于动作和鲁棒性而受到关注。在本文中，我们提出了一个新颖的ADHD诊断系统，其中包含基于骨架的动作识别框架，利用真实的多模态ADHD数据集和最先进的检测算法。与传统方法相比，所提出的方法显示出成本效益和显著的性能改进，使其更易于进行广泛的初始ADHD诊断。通过实验结果，所提出的方法在准确性和AUC方面优于传统方法。同时，我们的方法可广泛应用于大规模诊断和预测。",
