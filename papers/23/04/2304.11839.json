    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于局部能量分布的随机模拟退火（SSA）超参数确定方法。 SSA能够比典型的模拟退火（SA）更快地解决组合优化问题，但需要耗费时间进行超参数搜索。所提出的方法基于自旋（概率比特）的局部能量分布来确定超参数。自旋是SSA的基本计算元素，并通过权重与其他自旋进行图形连接。局部能量的分布可以基于中心极限定理（CLT）进行估计。基于CLT的正态分布用于确定超参数，其将超参数搜索的时间复杂度从传统方法的O(n^3)降低到O(1)。使用确定的超参数评估了SSA在Gset和K2000基准上的性能，用于最大割问题。结果表明，所提出的方法实现了平均割值的近似值。",
