    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体的快速增长对信息传播产生了巨大的影响，从而使谣言检测的检测变得极具挑战性。现有的谣言检测方法通常利用谣言候选的转发传播进行检测，将所有转发到谣言候选的转发视为时间序列，并学习转发序列的语义表示。然而，从传播的拓扑结构和转发作者的影响中提取有用的支持来揭穿谣言是至关重要的，这通常没有得到很好的解决。在本文中，我们将流通的声称帖子组织为一个adhoc事件树，提取事件元素，并将其转换为基于帖子和作者的双分法adhoc事件树，即作者树和帖子树。因此，我们提出了一种基于双分法特定事件树的层次表示的新型谣言检测模型BAET。具体来说，我们引入了单词嵌入技术和注意力机制来学习每个事件元素的语义，并组成更高层次的事件表示。借助于现有的社交网络中的拓扑结构和信息传播的影响力，BAET可以生成更准确的传播树结构。在两个真实数据集上的实验结果表明，BAET相比于其他方法具有更好的性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new rumor detection model named BAET, which utilizes a hierarchical representation based on bipartite adhoc event trees to generate more accurate propagation tree structures with the help of the topological structure and influence of information propagation in existing social networks. Experimental results on two real datasets demonstrate that BAET has better performance compared to other methods."
