The advantage of using the modified problem for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) methodology is that it becomes possible to represent the loss function in the form of a single term associated with differential equations, thus eliminating the need to tune the scaling coefficients for the terms related to boundary and initial conditions.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种方法，可以将具有初始和边界条件的微分方程问题简化为仅由微分方程描述的问题。修改后的物理启发式神经网络（PINNs）方法的优势在于，可以将损失函数表示为与微分方程相关的单个项的形式，从而消除了调整与边界和初始条件相关的项的缩放系数的需要。尊重因果关系的加权损失函数被修改，基于广义函数推导出了新的加权损失函数。对于多个问题进行了数值实验，证明了所提出方法的准确性。",
