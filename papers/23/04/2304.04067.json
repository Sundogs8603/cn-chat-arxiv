    "translated_abstract": "本论文定义了决策变量数量超过100,000个纬度的问题为大规模多目标优化问题。由于许多实际问题需要优化十万级别的变量，这是一个重要的问题类别。现有的进化优化方法在处理这种规模非常大的问题时存在不足。受到现有推荐系统成功处理历史交互有限的大规模物品的启发，在本文中，我们提出了一种称为“基于推荐系统的大规模多目标优化”（VMORS）的方法。该方法的思想是将这类问题转化为可以由推荐系统解决的问题。在该框架下，解决方案被视为用户，不同的进化方向是等待推荐的项目。我们使用汤普森抽样通过高斯过程逼近 Pareto-最优前沿上的后验分布，以推荐进化方向。对基准问题的实验结果证明了该方法在解决大规模多目标优化问题方面的有效性。",
