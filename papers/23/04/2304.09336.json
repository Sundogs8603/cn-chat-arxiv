    "translated_abstract": "准确预测短期电力价格对于制定有效的交易策略、电厂调度、利润最大化和高效系统运营至关重要。然而，供需不确定性使得这样的预测具有挑战性。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一种混合模型，该模型将技术经济能源系统模型与随机模型相结合。我们混合方法中的技术经济模型能够深入了解市场。它捕捉了潜在因素及其对电力价格的影响，这是仅仅依靠统计模型无法实现的。统计模型通过价格的解释来包含非技术经济因素，如市场参与者的预期和投机行为。混合模型可以生成传统的点预测和概率预测，从而为了解市场景观提供全面的理解。概率预测尤其有价值，因为它们可以使交易员和系统操作员在不确定性下优化他们的决策。",
