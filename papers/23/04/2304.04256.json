    "abstract": "Zero-shot dialogue understanding aims to enable dialogue to track the user's needs without any training data, which has gained increasing attention. In this work, we investigate the understanding ability of ChatGPT for zero-shot dialogue understanding tasks including spoken language understanding (SLU) and dialogue state tracking (DST). Experimental results on four popular benchmarks reveal the great potential of ChatGPT for zero-shot dialogue understanding. In addition, extensive analysis shows that ChatGPT benefits from the multi-turn interactive prompt in the DST task but struggles to perform slot filling for SLU. Finally, we summarize several unexpected behaviors of ChatGPT in dialogue understanding tasks, hoping to provide some insights for future research on building zero-shot dialogue understanding systems with Large Language Models (LLMs).",

    "translated_abstract": "零样本对话理解旨在使对话跟踪用户需求，而无需任何训练数据，近年来受到越来越多的关注。本文研究了ChatGPT在零样本对话理解任务中，包括口语语言理解（SLU）和对话状态跟踪（DST）方面的理解能力。在四个流行基准测试中的实验结果揭示了ChatGPT在零样本对话理解方面的巨大潜力。此外，广泛的分析表明，ChatGPT在DST任务中受益于多轮交互式提示，但在SLU方面很难执行槽填充。最后，我们总结了ChatGPT在对话理解任务中的一些意想不到的行为，希望为利用大型语言模型(LLMs)构建零样本对话理解系统的未来研究提供一些见解。",
