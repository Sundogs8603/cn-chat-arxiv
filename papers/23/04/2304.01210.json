    "translated_abstract": "Wi-Fi 6，即 IEEE 802.11ax 的创新，通过提高延迟、吞吐量等基本性能来改进无线局域网（WLAN）的技术。 正交频分多址（OFDMA）的主要技术特点支持多个用户通过相应的接入点（AP）并发传输各自的数据。 但是，用于 Wi-Fi 漫游的传统 IEEE 802.11 协议仅根据从 AP 接收到的响应帧获取的接收信号强度指示（RSSI）选择目标 AP。 长期来看，在密集用户场景下，这可能会导致单个通道拥塞，进一步增加关联延迟和数据包丢失率，甚至降低整个系统的服务质量（QoS）。 本文提出了一种用于实现快速漫游的多智能体深度 Q 学习算法 - MADAR 算法，以有效减少站点漫游时的延迟。",
