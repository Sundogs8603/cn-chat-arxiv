    "translated_abstract": "掩码图自编码器（MGAE）由于其简单和有效的特性，在自监督图预训练（SGP）方面已成为一种很有前途的范例。然而，现有的方法在原始数据空间中执行掩码-重构操作，类似于计算机视觉（CV）和自然语言处理（NLP）领域，而忽略了图数据的重要非欧几里得属性。结果，高度不稳定的局部连接结构大大增加了推断掩码数据的不确定性，并降低了利用自监督信号的可靠性，导致下游评估中的表示效果不佳。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的SGP方法，称为Robust mAsked gRaph autoEncoder（RARE），通过高阶潜在特征空间中更多的掩码和重构节点样本来提高推断掩码数据的确定性和自监督机制的可靠性。通过理论和实证分析，我们发现RARE能够有效地捕捉图数据的内在结构，并在不同的下游任务中优于现有的SGP方法。",
