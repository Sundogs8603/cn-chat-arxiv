    "translated_abstract": "系统性风险的研究通常通过分析从实践者和政策制定者使用的数量来引用几个度量来展示。几乎不可避免地，这些措施评估外生事件可能对金融系统产生的影响大小，而不分析初级冲击的性质。在这里，我们提出了一种对称方法，提出了一组基于系统在开始恶化之前可以吸收的外生冲击量的度量。为此，我们使用了债务排名的线性化版本，使能够清晰地显示出对正确的系统性风险估计的金融困境的发生。我们展示了如何明确计算本地化和统一的外生冲击，并通过谱图理论解释了它们的行为。我们还通过蒙特卡罗模拟将分析扩展到异构性冲击。我们相信我们的方法更加普遍和自然，并允许以一种简洁的方式表达系统风险。",
