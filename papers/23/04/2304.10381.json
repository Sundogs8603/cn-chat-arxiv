    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了CPDL+，这是一族表达式强大的逻辑系统，根植于命题动态逻辑（PDL）。在表达力上，CPDL+严格包含扩展了交集和转置的PDL（即ICPDL），以及连接查询（CQ）、连通正则路径查询（CRPQ）或某些已知的扩展（正则查询和CQPDL）。我们研究了CPDL+的表达力、双模拟的特征、可满足性和模型检查。我们认为，CPDL+的自然子集可以用公式的基础图的树宽来定义。我们证明了树宽为2的CPDL+公式的类等价于ICPDL，它也与树宽为1的CPDL+公式相同。然而，在树宽大于2的情况下，增加树宽严格增加了表达力。我们通过带石子的双模拟博弈来表征了每个固定树宽公式类的表达力。基于这个表征，我们给出了算法，用于判断具有最小或特定树宽的公式的可满足性和模型检查。",

It is argued that natural subclasses of CPDL+ can be defined in terms of the tree-width of the underlying graphs of the formulas."
