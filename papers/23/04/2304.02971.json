    "translated_abstract": "对比学习已成为计算机视觉自监督学习的重要方法。其核心目标是在最大化同一图像的两个增强版本之间的相似性（正对），同时最小化不同图像之间的相似性（负对）。最近的研究表明，难度更大的负样本，即难以从锚定样本中区分出的样本，在对比学习中发挥了更为关键的作用。本文提出了一种新的特征层方法，即用于对比学习的合成难负样本（SSCL）的采样，更有效地利用了更难的负样本。具体地，1）我们通过混合负样本生成更多和更难的负样本，然后通过控制锚点样本与其他负样本之间的对比度来对这些负样本进行采样。2）考虑到通过采样得到的负样本可能存在假负样本的问题，我们建议注重减轻这个问题。",
