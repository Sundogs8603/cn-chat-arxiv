    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了可扩展的基于随机核方法，用于联合多个来源的数据，同时预测结果或将单元分类为两个或多个类别。所提出的方法可以模拟多视角数据中的非线性关系，并预测临床结果，能够识别最有助于视图之间关系的变量或变量组。我们使用随机傅里叶基函数近似平移不变的核函数来构造每个视图的非线性映射，并使用这些映射和结果变量来学习视图无关的低维表示。通过模拟研究，我们发现所提出的方法在多视角数据集成方面优于其他几种线性和非线性方法。当所提出的方法应用于涉及COVID-19的基因表达、代谢组学、蛋白组学和脂质组学数据时，我们确定了几种COVID-19严重程度和预后的分子标志。",
