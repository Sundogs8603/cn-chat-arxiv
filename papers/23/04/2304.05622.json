    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a new image segmentation tool trained with the largest segmentation dataset at this time. The model has demonstrated that it can create high-quality masks for image segmentation with good promptability and generalizability. However, the performance of the model on medical images requires further validation. To assist with the development, assessment, and utilization of SAM on medical images, we introduce Segment Any Medical Model (SAMM), an extension of SAM on 3D Slicer, a widely-used open-source image processing and visualization software that has been extensively used in the medical imaging community. This open-source extension to 3D Slicer and its demonstrations are posted on GitHub (https://github.com/bingogome/samm). SAMM achieves 0.6-second latency of a complete cycle and can infer image masks in nearly real-time.",

    "translated_abstract": "Segment Anything Model（SAM）是一个新的图像分割工具，使用迄今为止最大的分割数据集进行训练。该模型表明它可以创建高质量的图像分割掩模，具有良好的实时性和通用性。然而，在医学图像上的性能需要进一步验证。为了协助在医学图像上开发，评估和利用SAM，我们介绍了Segment Any Medical Model（SAMM），它是SAM在3D Slicer上的扩展。3D Slicer是一个广泛使用于医学影像处理和可视化软件的开源软件。这个开源扩展程序及其演示已发布在GitHub上（https://github.com/bingogome/samm）。SAMM在完整周期中实现了0.6秒的延迟，并可以实时推断出图像掩模。",
