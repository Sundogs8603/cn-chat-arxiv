    "translated_abstract": "将知识图谱融入推荐是缓解数据稀疏性的有效方法。然而，现有的知识驱动方法通常通过枚举图的邻居进行递归嵌入传播。随着跳数的增加，节点的邻居数呈指数级增长，迫使节点在此递归传播中了解大量邻居以提炼高阶语义相关性。这可能会引入更多有害噪声，导致学习到的节点表示彼此难以区分，即众所周知的过度平滑问题。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了一种名为HiCON的知识驱动推荐的Hierarchical and Contrastive表示学习框架。具体而言，为了避免邻居的指数级扩展，我们提出了一种分层消息聚合机制，以单独与低阶邻居和元路径受限的高阶邻居交互。此外，为了提高学习表示的区分能力，我们提出了一种对比学习策略，其中鼓励相似的节点相互靠近，而把不相似的节点推开。在三个基准数据集上的实验结果验证了我们所提出方法的有效性。",

It effectively solves the oversmoothing issue in knowledge-aware recommendation."
