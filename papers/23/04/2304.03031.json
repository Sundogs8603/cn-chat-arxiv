    "translated_abstract": "在开放领域问答（ODQA）中，检索器-阅读器框架很受欢迎，其中检索器从大型语料库中为阅读器抽取一组相关的候选段落。这种方法背后的一个关键假设是，从检索器得到的高相关性分数可能表明从阅读器获取答案的可能性很高，这意味着检索到的段落很可能包含给定问题的答案。我们在本研究中实证驳斥了这种观点，并观察到基于DPR的最近的密集检索模型经常将无法回答的反事实情景排名高于可回答的原始情景。为了解决密集检索中这种对答案无感知的问题，我们寻求使用反事实样本作为额外的训练资源，以更好地同步DPR的相关性测量和问题-段落对的可答性。具体地，我们提出了反事实Pivoting对比学习（PiCL），这是一种新颖的用于段落检索的表示学习方法。",
