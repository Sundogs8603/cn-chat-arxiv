    "abstract": "Brain extraction is a critical preprocessing step in neuroimaging studies, involving the separation of brain tissue from non-brain tissue using MRI data.

This paper compares SAM with BET for brain extraction on diverse brain scans, considering image quality, MRI sequences, and lesion locations. Results demonstrate that SAM outperforms BET in various evaluation parameters, particularly in cases with signal inhomogeneities, non-isotropic voxel resolutions, or lesions near the brain's outer regions and meninges.

    "translated_abstract": "脑提取是神经成像研究中的关键预处理步骤，涉及使用MRI数据将脑组织与非脑组织分离。FSL的脑提取工具（BET）是当前的金标准，但由于图像质量问题容易出错。Meta AI的Segment Anything Model（SAM）显示出有希望的零样本分割潜力。本文比较了SAM和BET在不同的脑扫描中的脑提取效果，考虑了图像质量、MRI序列和病变位置。结果表明，在各种评估参数方面，SAM胜过BET，特别是在信号不均匀、非等向性体素分辨率或病变靠近脑外区域和脑膜的情况下。SAM优越的性能表明其在脑提取和分割应用中具有更准确、更健壮和更多样化的潜力。",
