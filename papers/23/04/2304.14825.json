    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱已成为一种重要的数据组织范式。SPARQL等可用的文本查询语言用于从知识图谱中检索信息，但不提供参与非技术专家的数据访问过程的方法。与基于表单和自然语言的查询一起，可视化查询形式提供了一种简化用户参与数据查询过程的方法。ViziQuer是一种可视化查询符号和工具，提供了可视化图形手段来描述丰富的数据查询，包括可选和否定构造，以及聚合和子查询。在本文中，我们从最终用户的角度回顾了可视化ViziQuer符号，并描述了概念和技术解决方案（包括抽象语法模型，以及文本查询生成模型），这些解决方案允许将可视化图形查询符号映射到文本SPARQL语言，从而实现了实际数据上的丰富可视化查询的执行。",
