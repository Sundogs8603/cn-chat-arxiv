    "translated_abstract": "近来，图神经网络(GNN)模型越来越多地被用于分类脑电图(EEG)数据，然而，基于GNN的神经系统疾病，如阿尔茨海默病(AD)的诊断仍然是相对未开发的领域。因此，本文提出了一种新颖的自适应门控图卷积网络(AGGCN)，该网络可以提供可解释的预测结果。AGGCN通过将基于卷积的节点特征增强与基于功能连接性的著名相关度量相结合来自适应学习图结构。此外，门控图卷积可以动态地加权考虑各种空间尺度的贡献。实验结果表明，该模型在闭眼和睁眼状态下均能取得较高的精度，表明学习到的表征结果的稳定性。最后，我们证明了所提出的AGGCN模型可以提供有关AD最受影响的脑区的重要见解。",
