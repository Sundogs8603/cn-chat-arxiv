    "abstract": "Strong foundations in basic AI techniques are key to understanding more advanced concepts. We believe that introducing AI techniques, such as search methods, early in higher education helps create a deeper understanding of the concepts seen later in more advanced AI and algorithms courses. We present a project-based and competition-based bachelor course that gives second-year students an introduction to search methods applied to board games. In groups of two, students have to use network programming and AI methods to build an AI agent to compete in a board game tournament-othello was this year's game. Students are evaluated based on the quality of their projects and on their performance during the final tournament. We believe that the introduction of gamification, in the form of competition-based learning, allows for a better learning experience for the students.",

    "translated_abstract": "基本的AI技术是理解更高级概念的关键。我们认为在高等教育早期引入搜索方法等AI技术有助于创造更深刻的理解，为更高级别的AI和算法课程打下基础。我们提出一个基于项目和竞赛的本科课程，为大二学生提供搜索方法应用于棋盘游戏的简介。在两人一组的情况下，学生必须使用网络编程和AI方法来构建AI代理以参加棋盘游戏锦标赛，今年的游戏是黑白棋。学生将根据项目的质量和在最终锦标赛中的表现进行评估。我们认为，引入竞争式学习的游戏化形式可以为学生提供更好的学习体验。",
