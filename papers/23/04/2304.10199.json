Existing unlearning methods are mainly devised for generalized machine learning models in classification tasks. In this paper, we first identify two main disadvantages of directly applying existing unlearning methods in the context of recommendation, i.e., (i) unsatisfactory efficiency for large-scale recommendation models and (ii) destruction of collaboration across users and items. To tackle the above issues, we propose an extra-efficient recommendation unlearning method based on Selective and Collaborative Influence Function (SCIF). Our proposed method can (i) avoid any kind of retraining which is computational",
