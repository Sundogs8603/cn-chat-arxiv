    "translated_abstract": "目前用于 PTZ 摄像头自主控制的方法通常采用多个阶段，其中目标检测和定位单独于 PTZ 机制的控制。这些方法需要手动标注，并由于信息流量的多阶段传递导致性能瓶颈。目标检测神经网络的大尺寸也使得之前的解决方案在资源受限设备上的实时部署变得不可行。我们提出的端到端深度强化学习（RL）解决方案名为 Eagle，用于训练神经网络策略，直接以图像作为输入，控制 PTZ 摄像头。在现实世界中，基于强化学习的训练因标注工作量、运行环境随机性和易损实验设置而变得复杂。我们引入了一种逼真的模拟框架，以训练和评估 PTZ 摄像头控制策略。Eagle 实现了卓越的摄像头控制性能。",
