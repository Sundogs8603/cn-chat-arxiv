    "abstract": "Novel intent class detection is an important problem in real world scenario for conversational agents for continuous interaction. Several research works have been done to detect novel intents in a mono-lingual (primarily English) texts and images. But, current systems lack an end-to-end universal framework to detect novel intents across various different languages with less human annotation effort for mis-classified and system rejected samples. This paper proposes NIDAL (Novel Intent Detection and Active Learning based classification), a semi-supervised framework to detect novel intents while reducing human annotation cost. Empirical results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that this system outperforms the baseline methods by more than 10% margin for accuracy and macro-F1. The system achieves this while maintaining overall annotation cost to be just ~6-10% of the unlabeled data available to the system.",

    "translated_abstract": "在连续交互的对话代理情境中，新型意图类别检测是一个重要问题。已经进行了许多研究工作，以检测英语为主要文本和图像中的新型意图。但是，当前系统缺乏一种端到端通用框架，以在各种不同语言的同时检测新型意图，同时减少对人类注释的需求以处理被分类错误或系统拒绝的样本。本文提出了NIDAL（Novel Intent Detection and Active Learning based classification），这是一个半监督框架，用于检测新型意图并减少人类注释成本。各种基准数据集上的实验证明，该系统的准确性和宏F1相对于基线方法提高了10%以上，且总注释成本仅为系统可用未标注数据的6-10％。",
