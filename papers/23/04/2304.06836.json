    "abstract": "In this work, we propose to use various artificial neural network (ANN) structures for modeling and compensation of intra- and inter-subcarrier fiber nonlinear interference in digital subcarrier multiplexing (DSCM) optical transmission systems. We perform nonlinear channel equalization by employing different ANN cores including convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. We start to compensate the fiber nonlinearity distortion in DSCM systems by a fully connected network across all subcarriers. In subsequent steps, and borrowing from fiber nonlinearity analysis, we gradually upgrade the designs towards modular structures with better performance-complexity advantages.
