    "translated_abstract": "鉴于现有的Lorenz曲线参数化函数不能适应所有可能的大小分布，因此引入了一种通用参数化函数形式。通过使用来自不同科学学科的实际数据以及假设数据，本研究表明，所提出的模型不仅适用于实际Lorenz图有典型凸段的数据，而且还适用于实际Lorenz图既有水平段又有凸段的数据，并且完全适用于观察值体积更大，而其余观察值的体积相等和较小的数据集，其特征为2个正斜率线性段。此外，所提出的模型具有Gini指数的闭式表达式，使其在计算上便捷。鉴于Lorenz曲线和Gini指数被广泛应用于各个领域的科学中，所提出的模型和Gini指数的闭式表达式可以用作分析同时具有零值和极端不平等的数据集的通用工具。",
