    "translated_abstract": "人与人之间的交流除了语言之外，还包括广泛的非语言暗示。将这些暗示应用于设计与人交互的机器人和其他人工智能代理，可能会带来更自然、易理解和易接近的交互体验。本文提出了一系列定义性的非语言代码，以地址通信研究领域的五个人类感官系统（视、听、触、嗅、味），可以将这些代码翻译为人机交互的设计模式，使用精选的通信研究和人机交互文献。由于非语言代码是人类交流的重要方式之一，我们认为将机器人的非语言代码整合到人机交互中，将为机器人带来“生动感”或“社会代理”，否则机器人将缺乏这种体验。最后，我们提出了研究方向的建议，以促进非语言交流领域在人机交互中的发展和改进之间的沟通。",
