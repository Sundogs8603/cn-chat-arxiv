    "translated_abstract": "自动化心理健康分析显示出提高心理健康护理效率和可访问性的巨大潜力，而最近的主流方法利用预训练的语言模型(PLMs)作为骨干，并融入情感信息。最新的大型语言模型(LLMs)，如ChatGPT，在各种自然语言处理任务上表现出惊人的能力。然而，现有的ChatGPT零-shot性能研究在不充分的评估、情感信息利用和方法可解释性方面存在局限性。本文全面评估了ChatGPT在11个数据集上的心理健康分析和情感推理能力，涵盖了5个任务，包括二进制和多类心理健康状况检测、心理健康状况的原因/因素检测、对话中的情绪识别和因果情感蕴含。我们在实证分析中探究了不同提示策略以及情感增强提示对ChatGPT性能的影响。结果表明，ChatGPT在心理健康分析中有着良好的表现，并且在某些任务中加入情感增强提示效果显著。",
