    "abstract": "The paper proposes a novel End-to-End Learning and Repair (E2ELR) architecture for training optimization proxies for economic dispatch problems. E2ELR combines deep neural networks with closed-form, differentiable repair layers, thereby integrating learning and feasibility in an end-to-end fashion. E2ELR is also trained with self-supervised learning, removing the need for labeled data and the solving of numerous optimization problems offline. E2ELR is evaluated on industry-size power grids with tens of thousands of buses using an economic dispatch that co-optimizes energy and reserves. The results demonstrate that the self-supervised E2ELR achieves state-of-the-art performance, with optimality gaps that outperform other baselines by at least an order of magnitude.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的端到端学习和修复（E2ELR）架构，用于训练经济分派问题的优化代理。E2ELR结合了深度神经网络和闭式、可微分的修复层，从而以端到端的方式集成了学习和可行性。E2ELR还使用自监督学习进行训练，无需标记数据和离线解决大量优化问题。通过在具有数万个母线的行业规模电力网络上进行经济分派的评估，结果表明，自监督的E2ELR实现了最先进的性能，其优化间隙优于其他基线至少一个数量级。",
