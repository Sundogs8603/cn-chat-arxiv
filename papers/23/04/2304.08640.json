    "translated_abstract": "道路安全是全球公共卫生关注的重点。准确的交通事故预测在减少交通事故方面具有关键作用。然而，现有的机器学习方法往往只着眼于单个位置的交通事故预测，而没有考虑到路网内不同事故地点之间的潜在关系，这就需要引入图结构信息，例如图神经网络（GNNs）可以自然地应用。然而，将GNNs应用于事故预测问题面临着如何获取合适的图结构交通事故数据集的挑战，为了弥合这一差距，我们构建了一个基于真实世界的基于图形的交通事故预测（TAP）数据库，并提供了两个典型任务：事故发生预测和事故严重程度预测。这个数据库覆盖全国，具有真实世界的网络拓扑结构和丰富的地理空间特征，可以用于各种交通相关研究。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过构建基于真实世界的TAP数据库,提供了两个任务:事故发生预测和事故严重程度预测,以用于各种交通相关研究，比较重要的创新是引入了图结构信息，使得机器学习方法不再只着眼于单个位置的交通事故预测。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study presents a comprehensive data repository, TAP, for traffic accident prediction, with two representative tasks of accident occurrence and severity prediction. The innovation lies in incorporating graph structure information, which alleviates the limitation of existing machine learning methods that only focus on predicting accidents at single locations."
