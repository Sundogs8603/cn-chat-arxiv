    "abstract": "Cheapfake is a recently coined term that encompasses non-AI (\"cheap\") manipulations of multimedia content. Cheapfakes are known to be more prevalent than deepfakes. Cheapfake media can be created using editing software for image/video manipulations, or even without using any software, by simply altering the context of an image/video by sharing the media alongside misleading claims. This alteration of context is referred to as out-of-context (OOC) misuse of media. OOC media is much harder to detect than fake media, since the images and videos are not tampered. In this challenge, we focus on detecting OOC images, and more specifically the misuse of real photographs with conflicting image captions in news items. The aim of this challenge is to develop and benchmark models that can be used to detect whether given samples (news image and associated captions) are OOC, based on the recently compiled COSMOS dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "Cheapfake是一个新出现的术语，指的是非AI（“cheap”）对多媒体内容的篡改。它们比deepfake更普遍。Cheapfake媒体可以使用图像/视频编辑软件创建，也可以在不使用任何软件的情况下通过在误导性声明旁边分享媒体来简单地改变图像/视频的背景。这种背景的修改被称为媒体的上下文（OOC）误用。与伪造媒体不同，OOC媒体更难检测，因为图像和视频并未被篡改。在这个挑战中，我们将重点关注侦测OOC图像，更具体地说是在新闻报道中，对真实照片的误用与不符合的图像说明。这个挑战的目的是开发和基准测试可以用来检测给定样本（新闻图像和相关的标题）是否为OOC的模型，基于最近编制的COSMOS数据集。",
