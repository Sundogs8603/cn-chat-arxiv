    "translated_abstract": "过渡态搜索在化学中具有重要作用，可用于阐明反应机理和探索反应网络。但搜索精确的三维过渡态结构需要大量的量子化学计算，因为势能面的复杂性。本文开发了一种物体感知 SE(3) 等变扩散模型，满足生成反应物、过渡态和生成物三种结构的所有物理对称性和约束条件。在已知反应物和生成物的情况下，该模型可以在几秒钟内生成过渡态结构，而不需要进行基于量子化学的优化，从而大大缩短了计算时间。生成的过渡态结构与真实结构的平均误差为 0.13 A 根均方差。通过对不确定性进行评估，并进行置信度评分，可以实现反应速率估计所需的精度 (2.6 kcal/mol)，并且只需对 14% 的结果进行基于量子化学的优化。",
