    "translated_abstract": "作为物流系统的数据基础，基于文本的交付地址包含丰富且关键的位置信息。如何有效地编码交付地址是提高后续任务在物流系统中性能的核心任务。面向自然语言处理(NLP)的预训练模型(PTMs)已成为编码文本中语义信息的主要工具。虽然在许多任务中相当有前途，但这些基于NLP的PTMs未能编码交付地址中的地理知识，这在物流系统(如菜鸟系统)中大大削弱了与交付相关的任务的性能。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种面向物流领域的域特定预训练模型，名为G2PTL，即交付地址地理关系-图预训练模型。G2PTL将文本预训练的语义学习能力与图建模的地理关系编码能力相结合。具体而言，我们首先利用真实的物流交付数据构建地理图，然后在图结构化数据上对模型进行预训练。实验结果表明，G2PTL能有效地编码基于文本的交付地址中的位置信息，并在与交付地址处理相关的任务中优于通用PTMs。",
