    "translated_abstract": "我们使用欧几里得空间通用逼近器作为构建块，构建了连续映射的度量空间之间的通用逼近器。早期结果假定输出空间 $\\mathcal{Y}$ 是拓扑向量空间。我们通过“随机化”来克服这种限制：我们的逼近器输出 $\\mathcal{Y}$ 上的离散概率测度。当 $\\mathcal{X}$ 和 $\\mathcal{Y}$ 没有附加结构时，我们证明了非常通用的定性保证；当它们具有适当的组合结构时，我们证明了 H\\\"older 类映射的定量保证，包括有限图之间的映射，在某些 Carnot 群之间的粗微分方程的解算子以及反问题中出现的 Banach 空间之间的连续非线性算子。特别地，我们展示了所需的 Dirac 测度数量由 $\\mathcal{X}$ 和 $\\mathcal{Y}$ 的组合结构决定。",

The limitation of assuming that the output space $\\mathcal{Y}$ is a topological vector space is overcome by using randomized output of discrete probability measures over $\\mathcal{Y}$. The paper provides qualitative and quantitative guarantees under suitable combinatorial structures."
