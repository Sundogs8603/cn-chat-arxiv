However, one major limitation of the method is a slow rate of convergence that is difficult to accelerate due to erratic, zig-zagging step directions, even asymptotically close to the solution. We view this as an artifact of discretization; that is to say, the Frank-Wolfe \\emph{flow}, which is its trajectory at asymptotically small step sizes, does not zig-zag, and reducing discretization error will go hand-in-hand in producing a more stabilized method, with better convergence properties. We propose two improvements: a multistep Frank-Wolfe method that directly applies optimized higher-order discretization schemes; and an LMO-averaging scheme with reduced discretization error, and whose local convergence rate over general convex sets accelerates from a rate of $O(1/k)$ to up to $O(1/k^{3/2})$.",

    "translated_abstract": "Frank-Wolfe算法是结构受限机器学习应用中常用的方法，因其快速迭代复杂度而受欢迎。然而，该方法的一个主要限制是收敛速度缓慢，由于步长方向的不规则震荡而难以加速，即使在接近解的渐近情况下也是如此。我们认为这是离散化的产物；也就是说，Frank-Wolfe的流（即渐近小步长情况下的轨迹）不会出现不规则震荡，因此减少离散化误差将与产生更稳定的方法和更好的收敛特性相辅相成。我们提出了两个改进：一个多步Frank-Wolfe方法，直接应用优化的高阶离散化方案；和一个具有降低离散化误差的LMO-平均方案，其在一般凸集上的局部收敛速率从$O(1/k)$加速到$O(1/k^{3/2})$ 。",
