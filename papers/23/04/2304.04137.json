    "translated_abstract": "在一些实际的学习任务中，如交通视频分析，可用训练样本的数量受到不同因素的限制，如有限的通信带宽和计算能力。因此，选择对学习系统质量做出最大贡献的多样化数据样本是至关重要的。选择多样化样本的一种流行方法是分布式点过程 (DPP)。然而，DPP存在一些已知的缺点，例如将样本数量限制为相似性矩阵的秩，并且不能为特定的学习任务（例如多级分类任务）定制。本文提出了一种基于码率-失真 (RD) 理论的衡量任务定向多样性的新方法，适用于多级分类。为此，我们建立了DPP和RD理论之间的基本关系，设计了RD-DPP，一种基于RD的价值函数，用于评估数据样本的多样性增益。我们还得到了一些特定情况下RD-DPP的闭合解，并在合成和真实数据集上进行了实验，表明我们所提出的方法在多样性优化方面的表现优于现有方法。",
