    "abstract": "This paper investigates whether ideological indoctrination by living in a communist regime relates to low economic performance in a market economy. We recruit North Korean refugees and measure their implicit bias against South Korea by using the Implicit Association Test. Conducting double auction and bilateral bargaining market experiments, we find that North Korean refugees with a larger bias against the capitalistic society have lower expectations about their earning potential, exhibit trading behavior with lower target profits, and earn less profits. These associations are robust to conditioning on correlates of preferences, human capital, and assimilation experiences.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了生活在共产主义制度下的意识形态灌输是否与市场经济中的低经济表现相关联。我们招募了朝鲜难民，并使用隐性联想测试来衡量他们对韩国的隐性偏见。通过进行双向拍卖和双边谈判市场实验，我们发现对资本主义社会有更大偏见的朝鲜难民其对自己收益潜力的期望更低，展现出更低目标利润的交易行为，并获得更少的利润。这些关联结果在考虑偏好、人力资本和同化体验的相关因素后仍然稳健。",
