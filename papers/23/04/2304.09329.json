    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的数据驱动方法，用于分配联邦学习中的发射功率，适用于干扰受限无线网络中的挑战性情景，如FL训练过程中无线信道正在变化以及本地设备上的训练数据不是独立且同分布的情况下。直观来说，功率策略旨在优化通信约束下FL过程中服务器端接收到的信息。我们的目标是提高全局FL模型的准确性和效率。该策略使用图卷积网络进行参数化，并通过原始-对偶算法求解相关的约束优化问题。从理论上讲，我们表明了制定问题具有零对偶间隙，并且一旦参数化功率策略，则最优性取决于此参数化的表达能力。数值上，我们使用实际的无线数据集评估了方法的性能，并证明了其优于传统的功率分配方法。",
