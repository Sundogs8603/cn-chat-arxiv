Recent models leverage geometric constraints to generate ligand molecules that bind cohesively with specific protein pockets. However, these models cannot effectively generate 3D molecules with 2D skeletal curtailments and property constraints, which are pivotal to drug potency and development. To tackle this challenge, we propose GraphVF, a variational flow-based framework that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry, for controllable generation of binding 3D molecules. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art binding affinity and realistic sub-structural layouts for protein-specific generation. In particular, GraphVF represents the first controllable geometry-aware, protein-specific molecule generation method, which can generate binding 3D molecules with tailored sub-structures and physio-chemical properties.

    "translated_abstract": "设计与特定目标蛋白质结合的分子是药物发现中的基本任务。最近的模型利用几何约束条件生成能够与特定蛋白质口袋紧密结合的配体分子。然而，这些模型不能有效地生成具有2D骨架退化和物性限制的3D分子，这对于药物的效能和开发至关重要。为了克服这一挑战，我们提出了GraphVF，一种基于变分流的框架，将2D拓扑和3D几何结合起来，用于可控生成具有结合能力的3D分子。实验表明，我们的方法实现了最先进的结合亲和力和特定蛋白质生成的实际次级结构布局。尤其是，GraphVF代表了第一个可控的几何意识，特定蛋白质分子生成方法，可以生成具有定制次级结构和物理化学性质的结合3D分子。我们的代码可在https://github.com/Franco-Solis/GraphVF-code中获得。",
