    "abstract": "Purpose: Robotic assistance in otologic surgery can reduce the task load of operating surgeons during the removal of bone around the critical structures in the lateral skull base. However, safe deployment into the anatomical passageways necessitates the development of advanced sensing capabilities to actively limit the interaction forces between the surgical tools and critical anatomy.  Methods: We introduce a surgical drill equipped with a force sensor that is capable of measuring accurate tool-tissue interaction forces to enable force control and feedback to surgeons. The design, calibration and validation of the force-sensing surgical drill mounted on a cooperatively controlled surgical robot are described in this work.  Results: The force measurements on the tip of the surgical drill are validated with raw-egg drilling experiments, where a force sensor mounted below the egg serves as ground truth. The average root mean square error (RMSE) for points and path drilling experiments ar",
