    "translated_abstract": "随着其便利性和多样化的应用，使用商用Wi-Fi设备进行无需设备的室内定位的需求在各个领域中迅速增加。然而，无线信道中的随机频率偏移（RFO）会影响室内定位的准确性，当使用波动的信道状态信息（CSI）时更是如此。为了减轻RFO问题，通过误差向量谱（EVS）来提高信号的分辨率并增强其对RFO的稳健性。为了解决这些挑战，本文提出了一种新颖的依赖于误差向量的深度学习（EVAL）方案，用于无需设备的室内定位。该方案采用深度神经网络来从物理层信号中提取丰富的信道特征，并通过分类的方式来确定人在室内环境中的位置。我们基于OpenWiFi项目进行了实际实验，以提取EVS和CSI并检验不同无需设备的定位技术的性能。实验结果表明，我们的EVAL方案在各项性能指标上均优于现有的定位技术。",
