    "translated_abstract": "反向传播已经快速成为现代深度学习方法的主要学分分配算法。最近，计算神经科学起源于的修改形式的预测编码（PC）已被表明可以得到与反向传播完全相同或近似相等的参数更新。由于这种联系，有人认为PC可以作为反向传播的替代方案，并具有有利的性质，有助于在神经形态学系统中实现。在这里，我们使用文献中提出的不同的当代PC变体来探讨这些声明。我们获得了这些PC变体的时间复杂度下界，并显示它们低于反向传播。我们还介绍了这些变体的主要属性，这些属性涉及神经生物学的可行性和它们的解释，尤其是从标准PC作为潜在概率模型的变分贝叶斯算法的角度来看。我们的发现揭示了PC作为神经形态学系统中反向传播替代方案的潜力。",
