    "translated_abstract": "虽然前馈神经网络（FNN）在各种任务中取得了显著的成功，但它们对对抗样本很容易受到攻击。已经开发了几种技术来验证FNN的对抗鲁棒性，但大多数技术都集中在针对单个数据点的局部扰动邻域的鲁棒性验证上。全局鲁棒性分析仍存在较大的研究空白。DeepGlobal是一种全局鲁棒性可验证框架，旨在确定FNN的所有可能的对抗危险区域（ADR），不限于测试集中的数据样本。本文提出了DeepGlobal的完整规范和实现，利用SMT求解器Z3进行更明确的定义，并提出了几项改进以进行更高效的验证。为了评估我们的实现和改进的有效性，我们对一组基准数据集进行了广泛的实验。我们的实验结果进行了可视化。",
