    "translated_abstract": "Cyberlogic是一种用于构建和分析数字交易的逻辑基础，这些交易涉及数字证据的交换。它基于（一阶）直觉istic谓词逻辑的扩展，具有证明和知识情态。Cyberlogic的关键思想非常简单，即（1）公钥对应授权，（2）交易被指定为分布式逻辑程序，（3）可验证的证据通过分布式证明搜索收集。特别是可验证的证据是由额外的逻辑元素，如签署文件和加密签名构造的。尽管Cyberlogic具有这种概念上的简单性，但授权策略的中心特征，包括信任，授权的委托和吊销，是可定义的。因此，使用可信时间源，可以在Cyberlogic中定义用于指定分布式授权策略和协议的表达时态知识逻辑。",
