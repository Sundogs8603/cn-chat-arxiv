    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种将视觉场分割为独立运动区域的方法，不需要任何基础真值或监督。它由基于槽关注的对抗条件编码器-解码器架构组成，修改为使用图像作为上下文来解码光流，而不是尝试重构图像本身。在结果的多模式表示中，一种模式（流）将馈送给编码器以产生单独的潜在代码（槽），而另一种模式（图像）将决定解码器从槽生成第一个模式（流）。由于惯常的自编码基于最小化重构误差，并不能防止整个流被编码到一个槽中，因此我们将损失修改为基于上下文信息分离的对抗性标准。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种新的无监督多对象发现方法，通过一种上下文分隔的槽结构来将视觉场分割为独立运动区域，并用对抗性标准来保证解码器无法重构整个光流。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel unsupervised multi-object discovery method that segments the visual field into independently moving regions using a contextually separated slot structure, and uses an adversarial criterion to ensure that the decoder cannot reconstruct the entire optical flow."
