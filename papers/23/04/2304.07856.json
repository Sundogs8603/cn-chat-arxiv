Our method, called coarsened Bayesian VARs (cBVARs), replaces the exact likelihood with a coarsened likelihood that takes into account that the model might be mis-specified along important but unknown dimensions. Coupled with a conjugate prior, this results in a computationally simple model. As opposed to more flexible specifications, our approach avoids overfitting, is simple to implement and estimation is fast. The resulting cBVAR performs well in simulations for several types of mis-specification. Applied to US data, cBVARs improve point and density forecasts compared to standard BVARs, and lead ",

    "tldr": "本文提出了一种名为粗化贝叶斯VAR模型的简单方法来解决多元计量经济模型中的规格问题。粗略似然代替精确似然，考虑到模型可能会在重要但未知的维度上出现规格问题，这导致了一个计算简单的模型。实证结果表明，与标准BVAR相比，cBVARs能够改善点预测和密度预测的准确性。"
