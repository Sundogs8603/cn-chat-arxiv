    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) store rich facts about the real world. In this paper, we study KG alignment, which aims to find alignment between not only entities but also relations and classes in different KGs. Alignment at the entity level can cross-fertilize alignment at the schema level. We propose a new KG alignment approach, called DAAKG, based on deep learning and active learning. With deep learning, it learns the embeddings of entities, relations and classes, and jointly aligns them in a semi-supervised manner. With active learning, it estimates how likely an entity, relation or class pair can be inferred, and selects the best batch for human labeling. We design two approximation algorithms for efficient solution to batch selection. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show the superior accuracy and generalization of DAAKG and validate the effectiveness of all its modules.",

    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱（KG）存储了关于真实世界的丰富事实。本文研究KG对齐，旨在在不同的KG中找到不仅实体，还包括关系和类别的对齐。实体级别的对齐可以促进架构级别的对齐。我们提出了一种新的KG对齐方法，称为DAAKG，基于深度学习和主动学习。通过深度学习，它学习实体、关系和类别的嵌入，并在半监督方式下联合对齐它们；而通过主动学习，它估计实体、关系或类别对的推断可能性，并选择最佳的批次进行人工标注。我们设计了两个近似算法以高效选择批次解决问题。我们在基准数据集上进行的实验显示了DAAKG的优越精度和泛化性，并验证了其所有模块的有效性。",
