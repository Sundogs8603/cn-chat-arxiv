    "translated_abstract": "网络中的节点表示学习是编码连续矢量空间中的关系信息同时保留网络固有属性和结构的重要机器学习技术。最近，DeepWalk、LINE、struc2vec、PTE、UserItem2vec和RWJBG等无监督节点嵌入方法从Skip-gram模型中出现，并在诸如节点分类和链接预测等下游任务中表现出更好的性能。然而，由于缺乏适用于嵌入的解释方法和理论研究，提供Skip-gram嵌入的后续解释仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。本文首先表明可以通过在谱聚类感知局部扰动下计算桥接度来找到Skip-gram嵌入的全局解释。此外，还提出了一种名为GRAPH-wGD的新型基于梯度的解释方法，允许检索top-q全局性解释，并通过实验证明了其有效性。",
