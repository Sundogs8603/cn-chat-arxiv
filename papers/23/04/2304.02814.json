    "abstract": "We present a high-precision real-time facial animation pipeline suitable for animators to use on their desktops. This pipeline is about to be launched in FACEGOOD's Avatary\\footnote{https://www.avatary.com/} software, which will accelerate animators' productivity. The pipeline differs from professional head-mounted facial capture solutions in that it only requires the use of a consumer-grade 3D camera on the desk to achieve high-precision real-time facial capture. The system enables animators to create high-quality facial animations with ease and speed, while reducing the cost and complexity of traditional facial capture solutions. Our approach has the potential to revolutionize the way facial animation is done in the entertainment industry.",
