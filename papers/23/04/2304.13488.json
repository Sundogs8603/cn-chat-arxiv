    "translated_abstract": "生理信号有潜力作为客观测量指标，用于理解用户与信息访问系统的行为和参与度。然而，这些信号非常敏感，在实验室用户研究中需要许多控制。为了研究任务顺序或持续时间等受控或非受控（即混淆）变量对观察到的信号影响程度，我们进行了一项试点研究，其中每个参与者完成了四种信息处理活动（READ，LISTEN，SPEAK和WRITE），同时我们收集了血容量脉冲、皮肤电活动和瞳孔反应的数据。然后，我们使用机器学习方法来检查用户研究中常见的受控和非受控变量的影响。发现任务持续时间对模型性能有重大影响，表明它代表的是个体差异，而不是提供有关目标变量的洞察。",
