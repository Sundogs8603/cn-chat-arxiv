    "translated_abstract": "在符号回归中，目标是找到一个分析表达式，能够在使用尽可能少的数学符号（例如运算符、变量和常量）的情况下精确地拟合实验数据。然而，由于可能表达式的组合空间很大，传统进化算法很难在合理的时间内找到正确的表达式。为了解决这个问题，研究人员开发了一种名为神经符号回归（NSR）算法，能够快速识别数据中的模式并生成分析表达式。然而，这些方法目前还缺乏将用户定义的先验知识纳入其中的能力，而这种能力在自然科学和工程领域通常是必需的。为了克服这种限制，我们提出了一种新的神经符号回归方法，名为带假设的神经符号回归（NSRwH），它允许显式地将关于真实表达式期望结构的假设纳入预测模型中。",
