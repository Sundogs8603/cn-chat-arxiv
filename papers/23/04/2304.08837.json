    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种基于观测器的新方法，用于检测和隔离工业系统中的传感器故障。考虑了两种类型的传感器故障：完全故障和传感器劣化。所提出的方法适用于一般的自主非线性系统，而不需对其三角形和/或正常形式进行任何假设，这通常在观察者设计文献中考虑。我们方法的关键是Lueneberger观察器的基于学习的设计，其中涉及使用神经网络来近似将非线性系统转化为具有输出注入的稳定线性系统的单射映射。这种基于学习的Lueneberger观察器准确估计了系统的状态，从而通过残留生成实现传感器故障的检测。残差是通过计算系统测量输出和观察者预测输出向量之间差值的范数而得出的。故障隔离是通过将每个传感器的测量输出与残差信号进行比较来实现的。该方法的有效性和鲁棒性通过对双罐系统的模拟结果进行演示。",
