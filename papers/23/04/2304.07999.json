With the stunning quality of AI paintings, it is widely questioned whether there still exists difference between human and AI paintings and whether human artists will be replaced by AI. To answer these questions, we develop a computational framework combining neural latent space and aesthetics features with visual analytics to investigate the difference between human and AI paintings. First, with categorical comparison of human and AI painting collections, we find that AI artworks show distributional difference from human artworks in both latent space and some aesthetic features like strokes and sharpness, while in other aesthetic features like color and composition there is less difference.

    "translated_abstract": "AI技术的最新进展，特别是AI生成内容（AIGC），使每个人都能够通过简单的文本描述轻松生成美丽的绘画。由于人工智能绘画的惊人质量，人们普遍质疑人类与人工智能绘画之间是否仍然存在差异，以及人类艺术家是否会被人工智能代替。为了回答这些问题，我们开发了一个计算框架，将神经潜在空间和审美特征与视觉分析相结合，以探讨人类与人工智能绘画之间的差异。首先，通过对人类与人工智能绘画收藏进行分类比较，我们发现在潜在空间和一些审美特征（如笔触和清晰度）方面，人工智能作品与人类作品显示出分布差异，而在颜色和构图等其他审美特征方面差异较小。其次，通过对毕加索的个体艺术家分析，我们展示了人类",
