    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) tools based on large language models have acheived human-level performance on some computer programming tasks. We report several experiments using GPT-4 to generate computer code. These experiments demonstrate that AI code generation using the current generation of tools, while powerful, requires substantial human validation to ensure accurate performance. We also demonstrate that GPT-4 refactoring of existing code can significantly improve that code along several established metrics for code quality, and we show that GPT-4 can generate tests with substantial coverage, but that many of the tests fail when applied to the associated code. These findings suggest that while AI coding tools are very powerful, they still require humans in the loop to ensure validity and accuracy of the results.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于大型语言模型的人工智能工具在某些计算机编程任务上已经达到了人类水平的表现。我们报告了几个使用GPT-4生成计算机代码的实验。这些实验表明，使用当前工具的人工智能代码生成虽然强大，但需要人类的大量验证来确保其准确性。我们还展示了GPT-4重构现有代码可以显著提高该代码在几个已有代码质量指标上的表现，并展示了GPT-4可以生成具有实质性覆盖范围的测试，但是应用于相关代码时，许多测试失败了。这些发现表明，尽管人工智能编码工具非常强大，但它们仍需要人类在其中发挥作用，以确保结果的有效性和准确性。",
