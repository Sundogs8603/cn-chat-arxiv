    "translated_abstract": "基于规则的代理模型是近似深度神经网络决策边界的一种有效且可解释的方式，使人类易于理解深度学习模型。现有的最先进的分解方法，即那些考虑到DNN的潜在空间以提取更精确规则集的方法，成功地推导出了高精度的规则集。但是，它们 a) 不能保证代理模型已从与 DNN 相同的变量中学习（对齐），b) 只允许优化单个目标，例如准确性，这可能导致过度大的规则集（复杂性），并且 c) 使用决策树算法作为中间模型，可能会导致相同DNN的不同解释（稳定性）。本文介绍了使用双线性规划从DNN的隐藏表示中提取规则的分解方法 CGX（列生成解释器） 来解决这些限制。这种方法允许优化多个目标，例如对齐，复杂度和稳定性。",
