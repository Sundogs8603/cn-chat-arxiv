    "translated_abstract": "大量证据揭示了移民在劳动力市场和健康融合方面的情况，包括对外国出生和本地出生居民消费医疗服务方式差异的静态分析。然而，我们对移民的医疗保健使用模式如何随居住时间演变所知甚少，尤其是在提供通用或准通用覆盖的国家。我们通过结合所有可用的当地卫生调查波，来研究西班牙的这一过程，这使我们能够单独识别出时间段、队列和同化影响。我们发现健康同化的证据有限，并且仅适用于移民女性拜访全科医生的情况。然而，外生与本地出生人群在健康保健使用上的年龄差异影响，有助于在西班牙居住20年后，在大多数卫生服务中实现利用模式的收敛。时间和来源地区的显著异质性均表明了必须审慎推断总体同化模式之前必须考虑一些非常细节的影响。",
    "tldr": "该论文研究了在西班牙医疗保健利用方面的移民同化问题。研究发现，移民女性看家庭医生的情况有一定的同化，而外来人口与本地人口在医疗保健使用上的年龄差异是导致在西班牙居住20年后，大多数卫生服务利用模式趋于收敛的原因。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the issue of immigrant assimilation in health care utilization in Spain. The study finds that there is a certain assimilation among immigrant women in visiting family doctors, and the age difference in health care utilization between foreign-born and native-born populations contributes to the convergence of utilization patterns in most health services after 20 years of residence in Spain."
