    "translated_abstract": "可公开获取的信息对于网络威胁情报（CTI）来说包含有价值的信息。这可以用于预防已经在其他系统上发生的攻击。但是，虽然有不同的标准来交流这些信息，但很多信息是以非标准化的方式在文章或博客帖子中共享的。手动浏览多个在线门户和新闻页面以发现新威胁并提取它们是一项耗时的任务。为了自动化这个扫描过程的一部分，多篇论文提出了使用自然语言处理（NLP）从文档中提取威胁指示器（IOCs）的提取器。然而，虽然这已经解决了从文档中提取信息的问题，但很少考虑搜索这些文档。本文提出了一种新的焦点爬虫ThreatCrawl，它使用双向编码器表示（BERT）搜索网络安全领域中的相关文档。ThreatCrawl使用主题建模和关键词提取技术来识别相关网站和网页，然后应用基于BERT的分类器来优先考虑最可能包含有价值CTI信息的网页。",
