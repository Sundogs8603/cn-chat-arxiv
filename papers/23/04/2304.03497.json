    "translated_abstract": "为了给用户提供更好的虚拟现实体验，现有的重定向行走预测方法利用未来信息来减少重置次数。然而，这些方法往往在部署时需要满足一个先决条件，可能限制其普适性。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的机制 F-RDW，它具有两个方面：（1）预测虚拟空间中用户的未来位置，而不需要任何假设；（2）将这些信息与现有的重定向行走方法相结合。第一步的基础是一个基于 LSTM 的模型，该模型利用用户的空间和眼动跟踪数据来预测用户在虚拟空间中的未来位置，第二步将这些预测值以适用的方式输入到现有的重定向行走方法中（例如 MPCRed，S2C，TAPF 和 ARC）中。我们的仿真测试和用户研究的结果表明，F-RDW 可显著减少重置次数，同时使虚拟环境与现实世界保持一致。此外，F-RDW 可无缝应用于各种虚拟环境，而不需要满足任何先决条件。",
