Building on impressive progress in both semantics and syntax, pragmatics concerns meaning in the practical sense. In this paper, we discuss several challenges in both summarization of conversations and other conversational AI applications, drawing on relevant theoretical work. We illustrate the importance of pragmatics with so-called star sentences, syntactically acceptable propositions that are pragmatically inappropriate in conversation or its summary. Because the baseline for quality of AI is indistinguishability from human behavior, we draw heavily on the psycho-linguistics literature, and label our complaints as \"Turing Test Triggers\" (TTTs).

    "translated_abstract": "对话的概括，即对话过程的论述，使得实用语用成为当代对话人工智能概括和其他应用的普遍限制。本文利用语义和句法方面的重大进展，讨论了概括对话和其他对话人工智能应用中的若干挑战，并借助相关理论研究说明了语用学的重要性。我们以所谓的明星句子为例，这些句子在句法上是可接受的命题，但在对话或其摘要中在语用上是不合适的。由于AI的质量基准是无法区分人类行为，因此我们 heavily 依赖心理语言学文献，并将我们的投诉标记为“图灵测试触发器”（TTTs）。我们讨论了对话摘要方法和语用人工智能应用设计和评估的影响，比如语音识别等。",
