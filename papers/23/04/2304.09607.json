    "abstract": "Due to the mismatch between the source and target domains, how to better utilize the biased word information to improve the performance of the automatic speech recognition model in the target domain becomes a hot research topic. Previous approaches either decode with a fixed external language model or introduce a sizeable biasing module, which leads to poor adaptability and slow inference. In this work, we propose CB-Conformer to improve biased word recognition by introducing the Contextual Biasing Module and the Self-Adaptive Language Model to vanilla Conformer. The Contextual Biasing Module combines audio fragments and contextual information, with only 0.2% model parameters of the original Conformer. The Self-Adaptive Language Model modifies the internal weights of biased words based on their recall and precision, resulting in a greater focus on biased words and more successful integration with the automatic speech recognition model than the standard fixed language model.

    "translated_abstract": "由于源域和目标域之间的差异，如何更好地利用有偏差的单词信息来提高目标领域中自动语音识别模型的性能成为一个热门研究话题。以前的方法要么使用固定的外部语言模型进行解码，要么引入一个庞大的偏差模块，导致适应性差，推理速度慢。在本研究中，我们提出了CB-Conformer，通过引入上下文偏差模块和自适应语言模型来改进有偏差的单词识别。上下文偏差模块将音频片段和上下文信息组合起来，仅有原始Conformer模型参数的0.2％。自适应语言模型根据有偏差的单词召回率和精确度修改其内部权重，使得自动语音识别模型更关注有偏差的单词，并比标准的固定语言模型更成功地集成。此外，我们在语音识别基准测试中对模型进行了评估，包括领域内和领域外的测试集，发现显著提高了成绩。",
