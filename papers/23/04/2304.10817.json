    "abstract": "Meta AI recently released the Segment Anything model (SAM), which has garnered attention due to its impressive performance in class-agnostic segmenting. In this study, we explore the use of SAM for the challenging task of few-shot object counting, which involves counting objects of an unseen category by providing a few bounding boxes of examples. We compare SAM's performance with other few-shot counting methods and find that it is currently unsatisfactory without further fine-tuning, particularly for small and crowded objects.
