    "translated_abstract": "用于解决部分观测的随机控制问题的一种典型方法是将控制和估计任务分开。然而，众所周知，这种分离通常无法为风险敏感控制问题提供实际的最优解决方案。本文研究了一类普通风险敏感性投资管理问题的可分离性，当存在一个有限维度的滤波器时。我们证明了，相应的分离问题（其中考虑给定观测量的条件滤波器分布，而不是未观测到的量）严格等于原始控制问题。我们扩大了所谓的修改Zakai方程（MZE）在研究分离问题时的适用性，并证明了MZE在我们的方法中简化为PDE。此外，我们推导了分离性的判据。我们没有解决分离的控制问题，但指出有限维滤波器的存在会导致有限状态空间。",
