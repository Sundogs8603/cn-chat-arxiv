    "abstract": "The standard non-invasive imaging technique used to assess the severity and extent of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA).

This work proposes a fully automated, and visually explainable, deep learning pipeline to be used as a decision support system for the CAD screening procedure. The pipeline performs two classification tasks: firstly, identifying patients who require further clinical investigations and secondly, classifying patients into subgroups based on the degree of stenosis, according to commonly used CAD-RADS thresholds. The pipeline pre-processes multiplanar projections of the coronary arteries, extracted from the original CCTAs, and classifies them using a fine-tuned Multi-Axis Vision Transformer architecture.

    "translated_abstract": "冠状动脉计算机断层扫描血管造影（CCTA）是评估冠状动脉疾病（CAD）严重程度和范围的标准非创伤性成像技术。然而，根据CAD-Reporting和数据系统（CAD-RADS）评分对每个患者的CCTA进行手动分级非常耗时且操作者依赖性强，特别是对于边缘病例。本文提出了一个完全自动化且可视化解释的深度学习流程，用作CAD筛查过程的决策支持系统。该流程执行两个分类任务：首先，识别需要进一步临床检查的患者；其次，根据常用的CAD-RADS阈值将患者分类到不同程度的狭窄亚组中。该流程对原始CCTA中的冠状动脉的多平面投影进行预处理和分类，使用经过微调的多轴视觉转换器架构进行分类。旨在模拟当前的医学实践流程，缩短临床评估时间，降低操作者依赖性。",
