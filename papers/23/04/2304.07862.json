    "translated_abstract": "在线新闻平台通常使用个性化的新闻推荐方法帮助用户发现符合他们兴趣的文章。这些方法通常预测用户与候选文章之间的匹配得分，以反映用户对该文章的偏好。一些先前的工作使用语言模型技术，例如注意力机制，根据用户的过去行为来捕捉用户的兴趣，并理解文章的内容。然而，这些现有的模型架构如果考虑了额外的信息，就需要进行调整。预训练的大型语言模型近年来取得了显着发展，这些预训练模型具有更好的单词关系捕捉和理解上下文的能力，并且具有迁移学习和降低下游任务训练时间的优势。与此同时，提示学习是一种新开发的技术，通过为更好的文本生成构建任务特定的指导，利用预训练的语言模型。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于提示的新闻推荐系统（PBNR），它结合了提示学习和预训练的语言模型以增强新闻推荐的准确性。我们在真实数据集上评估了PBNR，并进行了实验来将其与最先进的推荐方法进行比较。结果表明，我们提出的PBNR模型在推荐用户感兴趣的新闻文章方面优于其他方法。",
