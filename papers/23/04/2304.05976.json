    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在观察数据下，对两个组的二元响应变量以及一组协变量进行建模。分组变量可以是混淆变量（治疗和结果的共同原因），性别，病例/对照组，种族等。给定协变量和一个二元潜变量，目标是构造两个有向无环图(DAGs),同时共享一些公共参数。表示变量的节点集对于两组是相同的，但表示变量之间因果关系的有向边可以有潜在的区别。对于每个组，我们还估计了每个节点的效应大小。我们假设每个组在其DAG下符合高斯分布。由于DAG的马尔科夫性质，给定父节点后，DAG的联合分布是条件独立的。我们在两个组下引入了高斯DAG-probit模型的概念，因此是双高斯DAG-probit模型。",
