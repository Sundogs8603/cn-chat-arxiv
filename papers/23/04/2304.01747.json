    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络(DNNs)释放了合成孔径雷达自动目标识别(SAR ATR)使其摆脱了基于专业知识的特征设计，并证明了其优于传统解决方案的优势。在强背景相关性的形状方面，已经显示了地面车辆基准的独特缺陷，其结果在DNNs过拟合杂波且对陌生环境不具有稳健性。然而，固定背景模型训练和可变背景应用之间的差距仍未得到充分探索。受对比学习的启发，本文提出了一种名为对比特征对齐(CFA)的解决方案，旨在学习不变表示以实现鲁棒识别。本文方法提出了混杂杂波变体生成策略和配备通道加权均方误差(CWMSE)损失的新推断分支，用于学习不变表示。具体而言，生成策略经过精心设计，以更好地吸引分类器的杂波敏感性并扩大训练数据的多样性。此外，引入CWMSE损失可忽略变量背景中无关杂波的影响。实验结果表明，我们的方法在MSTAR数据集的移动和静止地面车辆基准上实现了最先进的性能。",
