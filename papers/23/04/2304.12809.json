    "title": "Can Voice Assistants Sound Cute? Towards a Model of Kawaii Vocalics. (arXiv:2304.12809v1 [cs.HC])",
    "abstract": "The Japanese notion of \"kawaii\" or expressions of cuteness, vulnerability, and/or charm is a global cultural export. Work has explored kawaii-ness as a design feature and factor of user experience in the visual appearance, nonverbal behaviour, and sound of robots and virtual characters. In this initial work, we consider whether voices can be kawaii by exploring the vocal qualities of voice assistant speech, i.e., kawaii vocalics. Drawing from an age-inclusive model of kawaii, we ran a user perceptions study on the kawaii-ness of younger- and older-sounding Japanese computer voices. We found that kawaii-ness intersected with perceptions of gender and age, i.e., gender ambiguous and girlish, as well as VA features, i.e., fluency and artificiality. We propose an initial model of kawaii vocalics to be validated through the identification and study of vocal qualities, cognitive appraisals, behavioural responses, and affective reports.",

    "translated_abstract": "日本的“可爱”概念或表达可爱、脆弱和/或魅力的方式是一种全球文化输出。研究探讨了在机器人和虚拟角色的视觉外观、非语言行为和声音中探索可爱性作为设计特征和用户体验因素。在这项初步工作中，我们考虑了声音是否可以通过探索语音助手语音的声音特质，即可爱的声音学，具备可爱性。根据一个包含年龄的可爱模型，我们对年轻和年老的日语电脑语音的可爱度进行了用户感知研究。我们发现可爱性与性别和年龄的感知相交，即性别模糊和女孩气质，以及VA的特征，即流利度和人工性。我们提出了一个可爱嗓音的模型，通过识别和研究声音质量、认知评估、行为反应和情感报告进行验证。",

The study found that cuteness is related to gender, age, fluency, and artificiality. An initial model of cute vocalics is proposed to be validated through the identification and study of vocal qualities, cognitive appraisals, behavioral responses, and affective reports."
