    "abstract": "We observe that the traditional use of DP with the Adam optimizer introduces a bias in the second moment estimation, due to the addition of independent noise in the gradient computation. This bias leads to a different scaling for low variance parameter updates, that is inconsistent with the behavior of non-private Adam, and Adam's sign descent interpretation. Empirically, correcting the bias introduced by DP noise significantly improves the optimization performance of DP-Adam.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们观察到在Adam优化器中传统DP的使用引入了偏差到二阶动量估计中，因为梯度计算中加入了独立噪声。这个偏差导致了对于低方差参数更新的不同缩放，这与非私有Adam和Adam的符号下降解释的行为不一致。实验结果表明，纠正DP噪声引入的偏差显着提高了DP-Adam的优化性能。",
