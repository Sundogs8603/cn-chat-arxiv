    "abstract": "The transportation sector accounts for about 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, an improvement of energy efficiency in the traffic sector is crucial to reducing the carbon footprint. Efficiency is typically measured in terms of energy use per traveled distance, e.g. liters of fuel per kilometer.

We propose in this paper an ensemble learning approach based on deep neural networks (ENN) that is designed to reduce the predictive uncertainty and to output measures of such uncertainty.

    "translated_abstract": "运输部门约占全球温室气体排放的25％。因此，在交通部门提高能效是减少碳足迹的关键。能效通常以每行驶距离的能源消耗来衡量，例如每公里的燃油升数。影响能效的主要因素包括车辆类型，环境，驾驶员行为和天气条件。这些不同的因素引入了估计车辆能效的不确定性。本文提出了一种基于深度神经网络集成学习方法，旨在减少预测不确定性并输出这种不确定性的衡量值。本研究使用公开可得的车辆能源数据集（VED）进行了评估，并将其与每辆车和能源类型的几个基线进行了比较。结果表明，该方法具有高度的预测性能，并且能够输出预测不确定性的衡量值。",
