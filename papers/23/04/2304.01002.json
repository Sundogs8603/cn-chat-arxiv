    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（如GPT-4、LLaMA）的进展改善了大规模生成类似人类写作的连贯句子，从而产生了所谓的深度伪造文本。然而，这一进展引发了安全和隐私的担忧，需要有效解决方案来区分深度伪造文本和人类书写文本。尽管以前的研究探讨了人类检测深度伪造文本的能力，但没有研究“合作”是否能提高深度伪造文本的检测。在本研究中，为了填补对深度伪造文本理解的空白，我们对两组人进行了实验：（1）来自AMT平台的非专家群体和（2）来自Upwork平台的写作专家。结果表明，人类之间的合作可能会提高两组对深度伪造文本的检测准确性，非专家组的检测准确性提高了6.36%，专家组的检测准确性提高了12.76%。",
