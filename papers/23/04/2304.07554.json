    "translated_abstract": "三维形状对于化学很重要，但有多重要呢？机器学习在输入简单、匹配问题的情况下效果最好。与机器学习普遍使用的数据集相比，化学数据集往往非常小，因此我们需要从每个数据点中获取最多的信息。持续同调测量点云在不同比例下的拓扑形状特性，并用于拓扑数据分析。在这里，我们研究持续同调对分子结构的捕捉能力，并创建持续同调特征（PHFs），用于编码分子的形状，同时失去大多数符号细节，如原子标签、价、电荷、键等。我们在一系列化学数据集上展示了PHFs的有用性：QM7、疏水性、Delaney和Tox21。PHFs和最佳基准一样有效。PHFs非常信息密集，比其他发现的编码方法要小得多，这意味着ML算法更加节能。尽管失去了大量符号信息，PHFs的成功表明，在化学中进行准确的机器学习预测仅需要三维形状（几乎）就足够了。",
