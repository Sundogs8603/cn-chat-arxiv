    "translated_abstract": "由于Transformer和预训练模型的不可避免的成本和复杂性，在长文本分类中引起了效率问题。同时，在高度敏感的领域，例如医疗保健和法律长文本挖掘中，潜在的模型不信任，虽然被低估和未被探索，但可能孕育重要的忧虑。现有方法通常将长文本分割，使用预训练模型对每个片段进行编码，并使用注意力或RNN来获取长文本表示以进行分类。在本文中，我们提出了一个简单而有效的模型，即Segment-aWare multIdimensional PErceptron（SWIPE），以取代上述框架中的注意力/RNN。与之前的工作不同，SWIPE可以通过有监督的训练有效地学习整个文本的标签，同时以无监督的方式感知段落的标签并估计它们对长文本标签的贡献。作为一种通用分类器，SWIPE可以支持不同的编码器，在分类上优于现有技术。",
