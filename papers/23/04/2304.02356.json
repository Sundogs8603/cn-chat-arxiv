The discrete nature of financial markets means that a continuous model is unable to correctly describe the traders' expectations of future price variations. The proposed binary tree contains, as special cases, classical models of market microstructure theory. The underlying price process converges to the classical geometric Brownian motion as the time interval between trades approaches zero.",
