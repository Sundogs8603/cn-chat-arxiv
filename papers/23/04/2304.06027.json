    "abstract": "Recent works demonstrate a remarkable ability to customize text-to-image diffusion models while only providing a few example images. What happens if you try to customize such models using multiple, fine-grained concepts in a sequential (i.e., continual) manner? In our work, we show that recent state-of-the-art customization of text-to-image models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when new concepts arrive sequentially. Specifically, when adding a new concept, the ability to generate high quality images of past, similar concepts degrade. To circumvent this forgetting, we propose a new method, C-LoRA, composed of a continually self-regularized low-rank adaptation in cross attention layers of the popular Stable Diffusion model. Furthermore, we use customization prompts which do not include the word of the customized object (i.e., \"person\" for a human face dataset) and are initialized as completely random embeddings. Importantly, our method induces only marginal additional parameter cost",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，在只提供少量示例图像的情况下，自定义文本到图像扩散模型具有显着的能力。我们的研究表明，当使用多个细粒度概念以连续方式（即持续性地）自定义这样的模型时，最近的文本到图像定制技术会遭受灾难性的遗忘。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新方法，C-LoRA，采用流行的稳定扩散模型中的跨注意力层中的连续自我正则化低秩适应。此外，我们使用不包括自定义对象的单词（即“人”用于人脸数据集）并初始化为完全随机嵌入的定制提示。重要的是，我们的方法只引入了微小的额外参数成本。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种新方法C-LoRA，用于持续自定制文本到图像扩散模型，并避免了新概念加入后过去相似概念的图像质量下降的问题。",
