    "abstract": "Not too long ago, AI security used to mean the research and practice of how AI can empower cybersecurity, that is, AI for security. Ever since Ian Goodfellow and his team popularized adversarial attacks on machine learning, security for AI became an important concern and also part of AI security. It is imperative to understand the threats to machine learning products and avoid common pitfalls in AI product development. This article is addressed to developers, designers, managers and researchers of AI software products.",
