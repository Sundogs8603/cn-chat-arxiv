    "translated_abstract": "尽管在单视角图像的3D人体姿态估计方面取得了重大进展，但以往的工作很少探索全局和局部相互关系，导致对人体骨骼表示的学习不足。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的交错图和注意力网络（IGANet），它允许图卷积网络（GCN）和注意力之间的双向通信。具体来说，我们引入了IGA模块，其中GCNs向注意力提供局部信息，注意力向GCNs注入全局信息。此外，我们设计了一个简单而有效的U形多层感知器（uMLP），可以捕捉身体关节的多粒度信息。我们在两个流行的基准数据集上进行了广泛的试验（即Human3. 6M和MPI-INF-3DHP），以评估我们提出的方法。结果表明，IGANet在两个数据集上均取得了最先进的性能。代码可在https://github.com/xiu-cs/IGANet上获得。",
