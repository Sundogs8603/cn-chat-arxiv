    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于干扰加噪声成分的功率谱估计和不确定区域（PSEUR）的一致线性阵列的简单有效的鲁棒自适应波束成形技术。具体来说，提出了两种算法来找到每个瞬时的干扰角度区间，基于采用的干扰方向的空间不确定区域。此外，基于对干扰和噪声成分功率的估计引入了一个功率谱，从而允许开发一种鲁棒的IPN协方差矩阵重建方法。所提出的方法有两个主要优点。首先，包含干扰方向的角度区域基于阵列数据的统计信息进行更新。其次，所提出的IPN-PSEUR方法避免了估计干扰区间所有可能方向的功率谱。仿真结果表明，所提出的方法在鲁棒性和自适应性方面优于现有的波束成形技术。",
