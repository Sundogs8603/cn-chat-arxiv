We adopt magnetohydrodynamic simulations with different global magnetic field strengths and large-scale dynamics, i.e., noncolliding and colliding GMCs. We train a diffusion model on both mass surface density maps and their corresponding mass-weighted number density maps from different viewing angles for all the simulations. We compare the diffusion model performance with a more traditional empirical two-component and three-component power-law fitting method and with a more traditional neural network machine learning approach (CASI-2D). We conclude that the diffusion model achieves an order of magnitude improvement on the accuracy of predicting number density compared to that by other methods. We apply the diffusion method to some example astronomical column density map",

    "translated_abstract": "本文引入了最新的深度学习去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）作为一种从投影质量表面密度图推断巨大分子云（GMCs）体积或数密度的方法。我们采用了具有不同全局磁场强度和大尺度动态、即不碰撞和碰撞GMCs的磁流体力学模拟。我们在所有模拟中训练扩散模型，使用来自不同视角的质量表面密度图及其对应的质量加权数密度图。我们将扩散模型的表现与更传统的经验二分法和三分法幂律拟合方法以及更传统的神经网络机器学习方法（CASI-2D ）进行了比较。我们得出结论，与其他方法相比，扩散模型在预测数密度的准确度上提高了一个量级。我们将扩散方法应用于一些示例天文柱密度图中。",
