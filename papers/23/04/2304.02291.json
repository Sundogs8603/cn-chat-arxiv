    "translated_abstract": "害虫计数是非常重要的，因为它能够预测早期害虫数量，从而实现快速害虫控制，减少对作物的损害，提高生产力。近年来，光陷阱越来越多地用于引诱和拍摄害虫进行害虫计数。然而，由于严重的遮挡、广泛的姿态变化甚至尺度变化，害虫图像的外观差异很大，这使得害虫计数更具挑战性。为了解决这些问题，本研究提出了一种新的害虫计数模型，被称为多尺度可变形注意力中心点网络 (Mada-CenterNet)，用于内部低分辨率和高分辨率联合特征学习。与传统的CenterNet相比，所提出的Mada-CenterNet采用了两步式的多尺度热图生成方法来自适应地学习适应于尺度变化（即害虫数变化）的低分辨率和高分辨率热图。此外，为了克服姿态和遮挡的挑战，采用可变形卷积来增强所提出模型的鲁棒性。在三个害虫数据集上的实验表明，所提出的Mada-CenterNet在害虫计数准确性方面优于现有的最先进方法。",
