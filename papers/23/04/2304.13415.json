    "abstract": "This paper addresses a regression problem in which output label values are the results of sensing the magnitude of a phenomenon. A low value of such labels can mean either that the actual magnitude of the phenomenon was low or that the sensor made an incomplete observation. This leads to a bias toward lower values in labels and its resultant learning because labels may have lower values due to incomplete observations, even if the actual magnitude of the phenomenon was high. Moreover, because an incomplete observation does not provide any tags indicating incompleteness, we cannot eliminate or impute them. To address this issue, we propose a learning algorithm that explicitly models incomplete observations corrupted with an asymmetric noise that always has a negative value. We show that our algorithm is unbiased as if it were learned from uncorrupted data that does not involve incomplete observations. We demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm through numerical experiments.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了一个回归问题，其中输出标签值是感应现象幅度的结果。这种标签值低可能意味着现象的实际幅度低或传感器做出了不完整的观测。这导致标签值偏低，学习结果也偏低，因为标签值可能由于不完整的观测而偏低，即使现象的实际幅度高。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个学习算法，显式地模拟了带有负值的不对称噪声的不完整观测。我们证明了我们的算法是无偏的，就像从不包含不完整观测的未损坏数据学习一样。我们通过数值实验证明了我们算法的优势。",
