    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了基于前瞻扩散概率模型（LA-DPMs）的技术，该技术利用了深度神经网络（DNNs）在扩散概率模型（DPMs）中，在连续时间步骤之后输出之间的相关性，以优化条件高斯分布的均值估计。我们提出了通过对两个$\\boldsymbol{x}$估计进行外推来计算更准确的$\\boldsymbol{x}$估计的方法。这可以通过在现有DPMs的后向过程中引入额外的连接来轻松将其集成到后向过程中，并且不需要对DNN模型进行微调。在几个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，与现有的最新方法相比，所提出的LA-DPMs方法是有效的。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a technique based on lookahead diffusion probabilistic models (LA-DPMs) to optimize the mean estimation of conditional Gaussian distributions, by extrapolating two estimates to obtain a more accurate value. The method does not require fine-tuning of the DNN model and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets."
