    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，基于神经网络（NN）的控制器在各种决策任务中表现出了显着的功效。然而，它们的黑盒特性和意外行为和令人惊讶的结果的风险对于在具有正确性和安全性强保证的真实世界系统中的部署构成了挑战。我们通过调查将基于NN的控制器转换为等效的软决策树（SDT）控制器及其对可验证性的影响来解决这些限制。与以前的方法不同，我们专注于离散输出NN控制器，包括整流线性单元（ReLU）激活函数以及argmax操作。然后，我们设计了一种精确但节省成本的转换算法，因为它可以自动删除多余的分支。我们使用OpenAI Gym环境的两个基准测试来评估我们的方法。我们的结果表明，SDT转换可以使形式验证受益，显示运行时改进。",
