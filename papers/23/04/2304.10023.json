    "abstract": "Introduction: The value of integrating federal HIV services data with HIV surveillance is currently unknown. Upstream and complete case capture is essential in preventing future HIV transmission. Methods: This study integrated Ryan White, Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicare, Children Health Insurance Programs and Medicaid demographic aggregates from 2005 to 2018 for people living with HIV and compared them with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV surveillance by demographic aggregate. Surveillance Unknown, Service Known (SUSK) candidate aggregates were identified from aggregates where services aggregate volumes exceeded surveillance aggregate volumes. A distribution approach and a deep learning model series were used to identify SUSK candidate aggregates where surveillance cases exceeded services cases in aggregate. Results: Medicare had the most candidate SUSK aggregates. Medicaid may have candidate SUSK aggregates where cases approach parity with surveillance. D",

    "translated_abstract": "引言：目前整合联邦艾滋病服务数据和艾滋病监测的价值尚未得知。上游和完整的案例捕获对于未来的艾滋病传播预防至关重要。方法：本研究将2005年至2018年的Ryan White、社会保障残疾保险、医疗保险、儿童健康保险计划和医疗补助的人口统计数据与疾病控制与预防中心的艾滋病监测数据按人口统计聚合，发现服务统计量超过监测统计量的聚合即为监测未知，而已确定服务的候选聚合。使用分布方法和深度学习模型系列来确定在聚合中监测病例超过服务病例的监测未知，即监测未知服务已知（SUSK）候选聚合。结果：医疗保险有最多的SUSK候选聚合。医疗补助可能有候选的SUSK聚合，其中的病例接近监测。",
