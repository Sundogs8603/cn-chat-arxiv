    "translated_abstract": "随着非结构化文本数据的增加，自然语言理解成为计算机算法中越来越重要的任务。自然语言处理(NLP)应用程序依靠语义网络进行结构化知识表示。设计NLP算法时必须考虑语义网络的基本属性，但它们的结构尚未得到研究。我们研究了由11种不同语言的7个语义关系定义的ConceptNet语义网络的属性。我们发现，语义网络具有普遍的基本特性：它们是稀疏的、高度集聚的，并呈现出幂律度数分布。我们的研究结果显示，大多数网络都是自我组织的。一些网络显示出语言特定的属性，这些属性受语法规则的影响，例如高度屈折语言(如拉丁语、德语、法语和西班牙语)的网络在度数分布方面有峰值偏差。",
