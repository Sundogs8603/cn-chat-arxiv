In this paper, we delve into the potential of NARS as a substitute for RL in solving sequence-based tasks. To investigate this, we conduct a comparative analysis of the performance of ONA as an implementation of NARS and $Q$-Learning in various environments that were created using the Open AI gym.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，强化学习（RL）已成为解决机器学习中基于序列任务的流行方法。然而，寻找RL的可行替代方案仍然是一个令人兴奋和创新的研究领域。其中一个备受关注的替代方案是非公理推理系统（NARS），它是一个通用的认知推理框架。本文研究了NARS作为RL替代方案在解决基于序列任务方面的潜力。为了研究这一点，我们在使用Open AI gym创建的各种环境中，对ONA作为NARS实现和$Q$-Learning的性能进行了比较分析。这些环境具有不同的难度级别，从简单到复杂不等。我们的研究结果表明，在各种环境中，尤其是在非确定性环境中，NARS是一个有竞争力的RL替代方案。",
