    "translated_abstract": "风格转移任务是在第二个目标图像的艺术风格下重新生成源图像的语义内容。本文提出了NeAT，一种新的最先进的前馈式风格转移方法。我们重新将前馈式风格转移表述为图像编辑，而不是图像生成，从而得到一个模型，在保持源内容和匹配目标风格方面都优于现有技术。我们模型成功的重要组成部分是识别和修复\"样式光环\"，这是许多风格转移技术中经常出现的产物。除了在标准数据集上进行训练和测试，我们还介绍了BBST-4M数据集，这是一个新的大规模、高分辨率的4M图像数据集。作为筛选这些数据的一部分，我们提出了一种新颖的模型，能够对一张图像进行风格分类。我们使用BBST-4M数据集来提高并测量NeAT在各种风格下的泛化能力。NeAT不仅提供最先进的质量，还具有更好的内容保存和风格匹配性能，是一种非常优秀的风格转移技术。",
