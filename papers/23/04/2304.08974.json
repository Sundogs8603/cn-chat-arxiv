Our framework accommodates many research designs, such as unconfoundedness, local treatment effects, and difference-in-differences.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的双重稳健估计器的类别，可用于治疗效果估计，并且还可以对弱协变量重叠进行稳健性分析。我们的估计器依赖于修剪具有极端倾向得分的观察值，并使用偏差校正装置来修剪偏差。我们的框架适用于许多研究设计，例如非混淆性，局部治疗效应和差异法。模拟实验表明，我们提出的工具确实具有令人满意的有限样本性质，这与我们的理论渐近结果一致。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a new class of doubly robust estimators for treatment effect estimands which is robust towards weak covariate overlap. The estimators rely on trimming observations with extreme propensity scores along with a bias correction device for trimming bias. The proposed framework can handle many research designs such as unconfoundedness, local treatment effects, and difference-in-differences. Simulation exercises demonstrate the attractive finite sample properties of the proposed tools, which are aligned with the theoretical asymptotic results."
