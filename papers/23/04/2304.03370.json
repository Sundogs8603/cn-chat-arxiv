We provide learners that are optimal in the sense that they always output the best possible reliability radius on any test point, and we characterize the reliable region, i.e. the set of points where a given reliability radius is attainable.

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习算法经常被用于即使经过精心获得的训练数据也无法准确捕捉的环境中，这既可能是由于测试时的“对抗性”攻击，也可能是因为“自然”的数据分布偏移。针对测试时攻击，我们提出并分析一种新颖的稳健性可靠性保证方法，要求学习器输出一个可靠半径 $\\eta$ 的预测结果，意味着只要对手没有扰动测试点超过距离 $\\eta$，它的预测结果就是正确的。我们提供了在任意测试点上都能输出最佳可靠性半径的最优学习器，并且特征化了可靠区域即可达到给定可靠性半径的点集。我们还分析了在分布偏移下的可靠学习方法，其中测试点可能来自于一个与训练分布不同的任意分布 $Q$。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了可靠的学习方法以抵御测试时攻击和分布偏移，在测试时引入了新的可靠性保障方法，确保预测结果正确。同时，该学习方法能够适应任意测试点，具有非常好的可靠性。"
