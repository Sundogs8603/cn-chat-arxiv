    "translated_abstract": "将一组系统发育树合并为一个解释它们的系统发育网络是演化研究中的基本挑战。现有方法计算成本高，只能处理少量的系统发育树，或仅限于严格受限的网络类别。在本文中，我们应用了最近引入的樱桃挑选理论框架，设计了一类有效启发式算法，保证生成一个包含输入树的网络，用于由二叉树组成的数据集。在该框架中，我们的一些启发式算法基于设计和训练能够捕捉输入树结构重要信息并指导算法产生更好解决方案的机器学习模型。我们还提出了简单快速的随机启发式算法，证明在多次运行时非常有效。与现有的精确方法不同，我们的启发式算法适用于实际规模的数据集，并处理广泛的网络结构。我们在模拟和真实的生物数据集上评估了我们的方法，并证明了它们在计算效率和准确性方面优于现有技术方法。",
