    "title": "High-frequency Anticipatory Trading and Its Influences: Small Informed Trader vs. Front-runner. (arXiv:2304.13985v1 [q-fin.TR])",
    "abstract": "In this paper, the interactions between a large informed trader (IT, for short) and a high-frequency trader (HFT, for short) who can anticipate the former's incoming order are studied in an extended Kyle's (1985) model. Equilibria under various specific situations are discussed. Relying on the speed advantage, HFT always trades in the same direction as the large order in advance. However, whether or not she provides liquidity depends on her inventory aversion, the prediction accuracy, and the market activeness. She may supply liquidity back (act as a front-runner) or continue to take it away (in this case we call her a small IT). Small IT always harms the large trader while front-runner may benefit her. Besides, we find surprisingly that (1) increasing the noise in HFT's signal may in fact decrease IT's profit; (2) although providing liquidity, a front-runner may harm IT more than a small IT.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了大内幕交易者(IT)与能够预测前者即将到来订单的高频交易者(HFT)在扩展的Kyle(1985)模型下的互动。讨论了不同情况下的均衡。依靠速度优势，HFT总是提前和大单交易同向。然而，她是否提供流动性取决于她的库存厌恶、预测准确性和市场活跃度。她可能会回馈流动性(充当压轴者)或继续带走流动性(此时我们称她为小IT)。小IT总是伤害大交易者，而压轴者可能使她受益。此外，我们惊奇地发现(1)增加HFT信号中的噪声实际上可能会降低IT的利润;(2)尽管提供流动性，压轴者可能比小内幕交易者更加伤害IT。",
