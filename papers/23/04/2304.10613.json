We introduce a general stochastic extrapolation technique that effectively reduces the bias. We show that for nonconvex smooth objectives, combining this extrapolation with variance reduction techniques can achieve a significantly better sample complexity than existing bounds. We also develop new algorithms for the finite-sum variant of CSO that also significantly improve upon existing results.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了覆盖了多个应用领域，包括投资组合选择、强化学习、鲁棒学习、因果推断等的条件随机优化（CSO）问题。由于其嵌套结构，CSO目标的样本平均梯度存在偏差，因此需要较高的样本复杂度才能达到收敛。我们引入了一种有效降低偏差的通用随机外推技术。我们证明，在非凸光滑目标函数中，将这种外推与方差缩减技术相结合，可以达到比现有界限更好的样本复杂度。我们还开发了用于有限和变量的CSO的新算法，也显著改进了现有结果。最后，我们认为我们的去偏技术也可能是适用于其他随机优化问题的有趣工具。",
