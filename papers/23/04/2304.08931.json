In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of vision-language models to automatically enhance textbooks with images from the web. Specifically, we collect a dataset of e-textbooks from one of the largest free online publishers in the world. We rigorously analyse the dataset, and use the resulting analysis to motivate a task that involves retrieving and appropriately assigning web images to textbooks, which we frame as a novel optimization problem. Through a crowd-sourced evaluation, we verify that (1) while the original textbook images are rated higher, automatically assigned ones are not far behind, and (2) the choice of the ",

    "translated_abstract": "教材是向学生传达优质教育的主要方式。已经证明，解释性或具象化的可视化内容在知识的记忆、理解和传递方面发挥着关键作用。然而，在发展中国家，许多教科书品质较低且缺乏有趣的视觉支持以助力于学生的学习。在本文中，我们研究了视觉语言模型的有效性，以自动使用来自网络的图像为教材增添图片。具体而言，我们收集了来自世界上最大的免费在线出版商之一的电子教材数据集。我们进行了严密的数据集分析，并利用所得的分析结果激发了一项任务，旨在检索并适当分配网络图片到教材中，我们将其作为一项新颖的优化问题。通过众包评估，我们验证了：(1)虽然原始教材图像评级更高，但自动分配图像并不相距太远，并且(2)选择的图像来源具有重要影响。",
