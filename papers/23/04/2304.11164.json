    "title": "Dialectical language model evaluation: An initial appraisal of the commonsense spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. (arXiv:2304.11164v1 [cs.CL])",
    "abstract": "Language models have become very popular recently and many claims have been made about their abilities, including for commonsense reasoning. Given the increasingly better results of current language models on previous static benchmarks for commonsense reasoning, we explore an alternative dialectical evaluation. The goal of this kind of evaluation is not to obtain an aggregate performance value but to find failures and map the boundaries of the system. Dialoguing with the system gives the opportunity to check for consistency and get more reassurance of these boundaries beyond anecdotal evidence. In this paper we conduct some qualitative investigations of this kind of evaluation for the particular case of spatial reasoning (which is a fundamental aspect of commonsense reasoning). We conclude with some suggestions for future work both to improve the capabilities of language models and to systematise this kind of dialectical evaluation.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近语言模型非常受欢迎，并且其能力得到了许多赞誉，包括通识推理。鉴于当前语言模型在以往通识推理静态基准上取得越来越好的结果，我们探索了一种另类的辩证评估方式。这种评估的目标不是获得一个总体性能值，而是找到失败的地方并描绘系统的边界。与系统对话可以检查其一致性，并获得越过单一证据的边界保证。在本文中，我们就空间推理（通识推理的基本方面）的特定情况进行了一些定性研究。结论包括对未来工作的一些建议，旨在提高语言模型的能力并将这种辩证评估系统化。",
