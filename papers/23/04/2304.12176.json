    "translated_abstract": "印度的大学和研究机构一直是该国人力资源发展的基石，培养着优秀的人才，塑造着未来的领袖。他们在教育和研究方面的卓越表现不仅赋予了个人力量，而且对国家整体的增长和进步也做出了重大贡献。尽管印度的大学和研究机构已经取得了重大进展，但在专利申请数量和已授权专利的商业化方面，该国仍然落后于许多发达国家。在印度，34％的学生选择STEM领域，拥有超过750所大学和近40,000所大专院校，但专利申请的集中度仍然在少数前10个机构之间，因此需要引起关注。因此，我们的研究旨在通过分析过去十年专利申请的趋势和模式，揭示印度大学和研究机构的专利景观。我们分析了一个由25所印度大学和研究机构组成的样本的专利申请特征，并将其与一个北美比较数据集进行对比。我们的研究发现，印度机构表现出较低的专利申请强度，合作程度较低，并且研究领域与市场不匹配。本文讨论了我们研究结果的含义，并提出了一组建议，以使印度大学和研究机构的研究和创新努力与社会和市场需求相一致。",
