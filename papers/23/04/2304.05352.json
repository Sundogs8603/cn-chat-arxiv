Accurate trial outcome prediction based on historical trial data promises better trial investment decisions and more trial success. Existing trial outcome prediction models were not designed to model the relations among similar trials, capture the progression of features and designs of similar trials, or address the skewness of trial data which causes inferior performance for less common trials.  To fill the gap and provide accurate trial outcome prediction, we propose Sequential Predictive mOdeling of clinical Trial outcome (SPOT) that first identifies trial topics to cluster the multi-sourced trial data into relevant trial topics. It then generates trial embeddings and organizes them by topic and time to create clinical trial sequences. With the consideration of each trial sequence as a task, it uses a meta-learning strategy to achieve a point where the model can rapidly adapt to new t",
