In this paper, we investigate how inherent symmetries of particular objects also emerge as symmetries in the latent state space of the generative model learnt under deep active inference. In particular, we focus on object-centric representations, which are trained from pixels to predict novel object views as the age",

    "translated_abstract": "人类每天要感知和互动上百个物体。为此，他们需要使用这些物体的心理模型，并经常利用物体形状和外观的对称性来学习通用和可转移的技能。主动推理是理解和建模有感知能力的代理的一种基本方法。它认为代理人在环境中产生模型，通过最小化上限的惊奇（即自由能）来学习和行动。自由能分解为准确性和复杂性项，这意味着代理倾向于选择最简单的模型，能够准确地解释他们的感觉观察结果。本文研究了特定物体天生对称性在深度主动推理下生成模型的潜在状态空间中也表现为对称性。具体而言，我们关注对象中心的表示，其从像素中训练以预测新的物体视图而年龄。",
