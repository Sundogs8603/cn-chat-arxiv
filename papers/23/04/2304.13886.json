    "abstract": "This study aims to alleviate the trade-off between utility and privacy in the task of differentially private clustering. Existing works focus on simple clustering methods, which show poor clustering performance for non-convex clusters. By utilizing Morse theory, we hierarchically connect the Gaussian sub-clusters to fit complex cluster distributions. Because differentially private sub-clusters are obtained through the existing methods, the proposed method causes little or no additional privacy loss. We provide a theoretical background that implies that the proposed method is inductive and can achieve any desired number of clusters. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves better clustering performance at the same privacy level, compared to the existing methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在缓解差分私有聚类任务中效用和隐私之间的权衡问题。现有研究主要关注简单的集群方法，对于非凸集群的聚类效果较差。通过利用 Morse 理论，我们将高斯子集群按层次连接以适应更复杂的集群分布。由于差分私有子群是通过现有方法获得的，因此所提出的方法几乎不会增加隐私损失。我们提供了理论背景，表明所提出的方法是归纳的，并且可以实现任意数量的群集。在各种数据集上的实验证明，与现有方法相比，在相同的隐私水平下，我们的框架实现了更好的聚类效果。",
