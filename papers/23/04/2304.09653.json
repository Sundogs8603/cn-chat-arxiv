    "abstract": "Short videos on social media are a prime way many young people find and consume content. News outlets would like to reach audiences through news reels, but currently struggle to translate traditional journalistic formats into the short, entertaining videos that match the style of the platform. There are many ways to frame a reel-style narrative around a news story, and selecting one is a challenge. Different news stories call for different framings, and require a different trade-off between entertainment and information. We present a system called ReelFramer that uses text and image generation to help journalists explore multiple narrative framings for a story, then generate scripts, character boards and storyboards they can edit and iterate on. A user study of five graduate students in journalism-related fields found the system greatly eased the burden of transforming a written story into a reel, and that exploring framings to find the right one was a rewarding process.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体上的短视频是许多年轻人发现和消费内容的主要方式。新闻机构希望通过新闻片段接触受众，但目前难以将传统的新闻报道格式转化为与平台风格相匹配的短小有趣视频。有多种方法可以围绕新闻事件构建片段式叙事，而选定其中一种则是具有挑战性的。不同的新闻故事需要不同的叙述框架，并需要在娱乐性和信息量之间达到不同的平衡。本文提出了一种名为ReelFramer的系统，利用文本和图像生成来帮助记者探索一个故事的多种叙事框架，然后生成他们可以编辑和迭代的脚本、角色板和故事板。在一项由五名新闻相关领域的研究生参与的用户研究中，我们发现该系统大大减轻了将一篇书面报道转化为新闻片段的负担，并探索叙事框架以找到正确的框架过程是非常有意义的。",
