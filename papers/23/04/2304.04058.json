    "translated_abstract": "有效地表示量子多体态在经典计算机上是一个极具实用意义的问题。理想的量子态表示结合了系统结构和对称性的简洁描述以及预测感兴趣的物理可观测量的能力。最近，已经采用了许多机器学习方法来构建这样的经典表示，使其能够预测可观测量并考虑物理对称性。然而，除非采用基于系统先验知识的专业先验形式，否则量子态的结构通常会丢失。此外，大多数这样的方法没有提供关于哪些状态比其他状态更容易学习的信息。在这里，我们提出了一种新的基于能量的生成量子多体态表示，该表示源自于用于模拟经典自旋系统的热态的Gibbs分布。基于先验信息，我们的方法以数据驱动的方式构建表示，捕获状态的复杂相关性和对称性。我们展示了我们的模型如何高效地学习1D和2D的量子多体态，无论是接近临界点还是远离临界点，以及如何自然地纳入物理约束条件，如守恒定律。",

It also demonstrates how to naturally incorporate physical constraints into the model."
