    "abstract": "The Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank has been the de-facto standard for evaluating POS taggers for a long time, and accuracies over 97\\% have been reported. However, less is known about out-of-domain tagger performance, especially with fine-grained label sets. Using data from Elder Scrolls Fandom, a wiki about the \\textit{Elder Scrolls} video game universe, we create a modest dataset for qualitatively evaluating the cross-domain performance of two POS taggers: the Stanford tagger (Toutanova et al. 2003) and Bilty (Plank et al. 2016), both trained on WSJ. Our analyses show that performance on tokens seen during training is almost as good as in-domain performance, but accuracy on unknown tokens decreases from 90.37% to 78.37% (Stanford) and 87.84\\% to 80.41\\% (Bilty) across domains. Both taggers struggle with proper nouns and inconsistent capitalization.",

    "translated_abstract": "长期以来，Penn Treebank的华尔街日报部分一直是评估词性标注器的事实标准，并且已经报告了97％以上的准确性。然而，关于领域外标注器性能的了解较少，特别是细粒度标签集。我们使用Elder Scrolls Fandom中的数据创建了一个适度的数据集，以定性评估两个词性标注器的跨域性能：Stanford标注器（Toutanova et al.，2003）和Bilty（Plank et al.，2016），它们都是在WSJ上进行训练的。我们的分析表明，在训练中看到的标记的性能几乎与领域内性能一样好，但是未知标记的准确性从90.37％下降到78.37％（斯坦福大学），从87.84％下降到80.41％（Bilty）跨越领域。两个标注器都难以处理专有名词和不一致的大写形式。",
