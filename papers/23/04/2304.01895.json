    "translated_abstract": "准确且鲁棒的道路用户轨迹预测对于实现安全自动驾驶至关重要。为此，通常使用机器学习模型，但当遇到之前未见过的输入时，这些模型可能表现出不稳定的行为。本文对两个环境感知模型（MotionCNN和MultiPath++）以及两个常见基线模型（Constant Velocity和LSTM）进行了鲁棒性基准测试，评估这些模型在面对车辆部署期间观察到的功能不足的各种扰动时的表现。结果表明，在这些扰动的存在下，性能显著下降，通常使用的轨迹预测评估指标的误差增加了高达+1444.8％。使用类似扰动的数据训练模型有效减少了性能降低，误差增长最高可达+87.5％。本文认为，尽管数据扩充是一种有效的缓解策略，但仍需要更多工作来提高模型鲁棒性。",
