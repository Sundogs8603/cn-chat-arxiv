    "abstract": "We demonstrate that if consciousness is relevant for the temporal evolution of a system's states -- that is, if it is dynamically relevant -- then AI systems cannot be conscious. That is because AI systems run on CPUs, GPUs, TPUs or other processors which have been designed and verified to adhere to computational dynamics that systematically preclude or suppress deviations. The design and verification preclude or suppress, in particular, potential consciousness-related dynamical effects, so that if consciousness is dynamically relevant, AI systems cannot be conscious.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们证明了，如果意识与系统状态的时间演化有关，也就是说，如果它在动态上具有相关性，则人工智能系统就不能具有意识。这是因为人工智能系统运行在CPU、GPU、TPU或其他处理器上，这些处理器的设计和验证是为了遵守计算动力学，从而系统地排除或抑制偏差。特别是，设计和验证排除或抑制了可能与意识相关的动力学效应，因此如果意识在动态上具有相关性，则人工智能系统不能具有意识。",
