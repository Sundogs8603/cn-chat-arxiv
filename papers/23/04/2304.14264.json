    "abstract": "This papers aims to establish the empirical relationship between income, net wealth and their joint distribution in a selected group of euro area countries. I estimate measures of dependence between income and net wealth using a semiparametric copula approach and calculate a bivariate Gini coefficient. By combining structural inference from vector autoregressions on the macroeconomic level with a simulation using microeconomic data, I investigate how conventional and unconventional monetary policy measures affect the joint distribution. Results indicate that effects of monetary policy are highly heterogeneous across different countries, both in terms of the dependence of income and net wealth on each other, and in terms of inequality in both income and net wealth.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在确定欧元区某些国家中收入、净财富及其联合分布之间的经验关系。作者使用半参数估计Copula方法估算了收入和净财富之间的依赖程度并计算了双变量基尼系数。通过将来自宏观水平向量自回归的结构性推断与使用微观经济数据的模拟相结合，作者研究了传统和非传统货币政策措施对联合分布的影响。结果表明，货币政策的影响在不同国家之间高度异质性，在收入和净财富的依赖性以及不平等方面都是如此。",
