    "translated_abstract": "应用程序的能源效率问题可能会对应用程序用户造成重大问题，并在应用商店广泛讨论。之前的研究表明，研究与能源相关的应用程序评论以确定能源相关用户反馈的主要原因或类别的重要性。然而，还没有研究有效地自动提取与能源相关的应用程序评论。在本文中，我们经验性地研究了不同的技术，以自动提取与能源相关的用户反馈。我们比较了许多机器学习模型的准确性、F1分数和运行时间，并与相关特征组合和相对较新的基于神经网络的模型进行比较。总共比较了60个机器学习模型，以及使用六种神经网络架构和三种单词嵌入模型构建的30个模型。我们开发了一个可视化工具，通过该工具，开发人员可以遍历这个大规模的结果集。结果表明，神经网络优于其他机器学习模型。",
