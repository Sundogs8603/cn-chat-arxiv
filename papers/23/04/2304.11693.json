    "abstract": "Semi-cooperative behaviors are intrinsic properties of human drivers and should be considered for autonomous driving. In addition, new autonomous planners can consider the social value orientation (SVO) of human drivers to generate socially-compliant trajectories. Yet the overall impact on traffic flow for this new class of planners remain to be understood. In this work, we present study of implicit semi-cooperative driving where agents deploy a game-theoretic version of iterative best response assuming knowledge of the SVOs of other agents. We simulate nominal traffic flow and investigate whether the proportion of prosocial agents on the road impact individual or system-wide driving performance. Experiments show that the proportion of prosocial agents has a minor impact on overall traffic flow and that benefits of semi-cooperation disproportionally affect egoistic and high-speed drivers.",

    "translated_abstract": "半合作行为是人类驾驶员固有的特性，应该考虑到自动驾驶。此外，新的自主规划器可以考虑人类驾驶员的社会价值取向（SVO）以生成符合社会准则的轨迹。然而，这种新型规划器对交通流量的整体影响仍需了解。在这项工作中，我们研究了隐式半合作驾驶，其中代理人部署了一个博弈论版本的迭代最佳响应，假定知道其他代理人的SVO。我们模拟名义交通流量，并研究了道路上的利他代理人比例是否影响个体或系统级驾驶表现。实验表明，利他代理人的比例对整体交通流量影响较小，而半合作的好处不成比例地影响利己和高速驾驶员。",
