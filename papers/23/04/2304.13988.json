For example, in the True Type Font (TTF) file format, contours describe vector outlines of typeface shapes. Each contour is often defined as a sequence of points. In this paper, we tackle the contour completion task. In this task, the input is a contour sequence with missing points, and the output is a generated completed contour. This task is more difficult than image completion because, for images, the missing pixels are indicated. Since there is no such indication in the contour completion task, we must solve the problem of missing part detection and completion simultaneously. We propose a Transformer-based method to solve this problem and show the results of the typeface contour completion.",

    "translated_abstract": "在文档和图形中，轮廓是描述特定形状的流行格式。例如，在True Type Font（TTF）文件格式中，轮廓描述字形的矢量轮廓。每个轮廓通常被定义为点序列。在这篇论文中，我们解决了轮廓完整度问题。在这个任务中，输入是一个包含缺失点的轮廓序列，输出是一个生成的完整轮廓。这个任务比图像完成任务更加困难，因为对于图像，缺失的像素是可以指示的，而在轮廓完整度任务中没有这样的指示，我们必须同时解决缺失部分检测和完成问题。我们提出了一种基于Transformer的方法来解决这个问题，并展示了字体轮廓完整度的结果。",
