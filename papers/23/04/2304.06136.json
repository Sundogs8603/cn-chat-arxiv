    "translated_abstract": "人工通用智能（AGI）有望革新包括医疗保健、金融、交通和教育在内的各个领域。在医疗保健领域，AGI被用于分析临床医学记录，识别患者数据中的模式，并帮助患者管理。农业是影响全球个体生活的另一关键领域。它作为提供粮食、纤维和燃料的基础，却面临着气候变化、土壤退化、水资源匮乏和粮食安全等多种挑战。AGI有能力通过提高作物产量、减少浪费和促进可持续农业实践来解决这些问题。它还可以通过利用实时数据帮助农民做出明智决策，实现更高效和有效的农业管理。本文探讨了AGI在农业中的潜在应用，如农业图像处理、自然语言处理（NLP）、机器人技术、知识图谱和深度学习等。",
