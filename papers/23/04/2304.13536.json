    "translated_abstract": "最近在眼动数据的可解释人工智能方面的工作对于解释用于眼动测量生物识别的深度神经序列模型的输出的特征归因方法的适用性进行了评估。这些方法提供显着性地图来突出特定眼注视序列的重要输入特征。但是，到目前为止，它的本地化分析在整个数据集上缺少数量化的方法。在这项工作中，我们采用了已经建立的固定点和扫视眼动事件检测算法，并通过确定它们的概念影响来定量评估这些事件的影响。属于扫视的输入特征比属于固定点的特征重要得多。通过将扫视事件分解为子事件，我们能够展示接近扫视峰值速度的注视样本是最有影响力的。我们进一步研究了事件属性如扫视幅度或固定离散度对深度神经模型准确性的影响。我们的结果展示了使用眼动事件作为可解释概念解释深度神经序列模型的有用性。",
