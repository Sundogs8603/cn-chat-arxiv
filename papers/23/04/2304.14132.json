    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种在毫米波雷达稀疏时序点云上进行语义分割的框架。相比相机和激光雷达，毫米波雷达具有不泄露隐私、强抗干扰能力和长检测距离的优势。然而，毫米波数据的稀疏和时间拓扑特征的捕获仍然是一个问题，特别是在人类语义分割任务中，以前的先进分割方法 (如PointNet、PointCNN、Point Transformer) 没有被充分应用于实际场景中。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种在毫米波雷达稀疏点云上进行人类语义分割的框架，该框架优于相机和激光雷达的隐私保护和抗干扰能力。同时，本文引入图结构和拓扑特征，并设计了一个含有全局特征模块和顺序特征模块的语义分割框架，成功解决了稀疏和时间拓扑特征的问题。"
