    "abstract": "Sky illumination is a core source of lighting in rendering, and a substantial amount of work has been developed to simulate lighting from clear skies. However, in reality, clouds substantially alter the appearance of the sky and subsequently change the scene's illumination. While there have been recent advances in developing sky models which include clouds, these all neglect cloud movement which is a crucial component of cloudy sky appearance. In any sort of video or interactive environment, it can be expected that clouds will move, sometimes quite substantially in a short period of time. Our work proposes a solution to this which enables whole-sky dynamic cloud synthesis for the first time. We achieve this by proposing a multi-timescale sky appearance model which learns to predict the sky illumination over various timescales, and can be used to add dynamism to previous static, cloudy sky lighting approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "天空照明是渲染中的核心光源，已经有很多工作开展了模拟晴空照明。然而，在现实中，云朵会显著改变天空的外观，进而改变场景的照明。尽管最近在开发包括云的天空模型方面取得了进展，但这些都忽略了云运动，而云运动是云天空外观的关键组成部分。在任何视频或交互环境中，可以预期云会移动，在短时间内有时会有相当大的移动。我们的工作提出了一种解决方案，首次实现了整个天空的动态云合成。我们通过提出一个多时间尺度天空外观模型，学习预测不同时间尺度上的天空照明，从而能够增加先前静态、云天空照明方法的动态性。",
