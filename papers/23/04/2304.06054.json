    "translated_abstract": "滑坡易发性预测一直是一个重要而具有挑战性的内容。然而，易发性建模存在一些不确定性问题，如滑坡样本误差和环境因素之间的复杂非线性关系。本文提出了一种自筛选图卷积网络和长短期记忆网络（SGCN-LSTM）模型，以克服滑坡易发性预测中的上述问题。SGCN-LSTM模型具有广泛性和良好的学习能力。自筛选网络可以消除一定阈值区间外具有大误差的滑坡样本，并且可以从空间节点和时间序列中提取环境因素之间的非线性关系，从而更好地模拟环境因素之间的非线性关系。SGCN-LSTM模型应用于江西省安远县的滑坡易发性预测，并与多元逻辑回归、随机森林、极端学习机和支持向量机等四种常用模型进行比较。结果表明，SGCN-LSTM模型在滑坡易发性预测方面具有最高的准确度和曲线下面积（AUC）值，表明其在滑坡易发性预测方面具有更好的性能。",
