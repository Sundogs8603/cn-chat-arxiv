    "translated_abstract": "嗜酸性食管炎（EoE）是一种与食物过敏炎症有关的慢性疾病，与食管嗜酸性粒细胞升高有关。EoE是GERD后慢性吞咽困难的主要原因之一。EoE的诊断依赖于计数组织学切片中的嗜酸性粒细胞，这是一项手动且耗时的任务，限制了提取复杂的患者相关特征的能力。EoE的治疗包括药物和食物消除。个性化的食物消除计划对于患者的参与和治疗效果至关重要，但先前的尝试未能产生显著的结果。在这项工作中，我们一方面利用人工智能从整个活检切片中推断组织学特征，这些特征无法手动提取。另一方面，我们开发了因果学习模型来处理这些丰富的数据。我们将我们的方法应用于“六种食物与一种食物嗜酸性食管炎饮食研究”，针对112名18-60岁的有症状成年患者进行了研究。",
