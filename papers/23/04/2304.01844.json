Here, a grid module can be used as an interaction medium between the outside world and a system, as well as a self-reinforcement medium within the system. The space-division and exploration-exploitation (SD2E) receives the 0/1 signals of a grid through its space-division (SD) module. The system described in this paper is also a theoretical model derived from experiments conducted",

    "translated_abstract": "理解大脑如何通过产生神经信号与外部世界相互作用对于确定其工作机制、治疗脑部疾病和理解智能非常重要。然而，尽管已经提出了许多理论模型，但它们迄今难以整合和发展。受网格细胞启发，本研究创建了一个更通用和强大的网格模块，并与贝叶斯推理一起构建了一个互动和自我强化的认知系统。这种方法称为带有网格反馈的空间划分和探索利用（Grid-SD2E）。在这里，网格模块可以用作外部世界和系统之间的交互介质，也可以用作系统内的自我强化介质。空间划分和探索利用（SD2E）通过其空间划分（SD）模块接收网格的0/1信号。本文描述的系统也是从进行的实验得出的理论模型。",
