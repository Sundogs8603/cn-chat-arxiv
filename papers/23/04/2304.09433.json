    "translated_abstract": "数据管理界长期以来的目标是开发出通用自动化系统，可以在不需要人力或特定领域的定制情况下摄取半结构化文档并输出可查询的表格。鉴于潜在文档的多样性，现有的最先进系统进行简化的假设并使用特定领域的训练。本文中，我们询问是否可以通过使用大型语言模型（LLMs）来保持广泛性。在广泛数据上预训练的LLMs可仅限于基于自然语言任务描述执行各种下游任务。我们提出并评估了由LLMs驱动的简单原型系统EVAPORATE。我们确定了实现该系统的两种基本不同策略：提示LLM直接从文档中提取值或提示LLM合成执行提取的代码。我们的评估显示，这两种方法之间存在成本-质量权衡。代码合成便宜，但比直接抽取远不准确。我们对四种不同类型文档的实验表明，EVAPORATE可以在不需要任何文档特定的定制情况下为各种文档类型生成高质量的表格。",

The system proposes two strategies for implementing this: directly extracting values from documents or synthesizing code that performs the extraction. The experiments show that the system, called EVAPORATE, can produce high-quality tables for various types of documents without any document-specific customization."
