    "translated_abstract": "虽然在医学图像分割中保持形状连续性和生理解剖学的假设是自然的，但深度学习方法通常忽视这一点，它们主要旨在统计建模输入数据作为像素，而不是相互连接的结构。然而，在生物结构中，器官并不是独立的实体；例如，在现实中，断开的血管是潜在问题的指标，但传统分割模型并没有被设计为严格执行解剖连续性，可能导致不准确的医学诊断。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于图形的方法，在医学图像中强制执行解剖拓扑的连续性和连通性。我们的方法将形状的连续性编码为图形约束，确保网络的预测保持这种连续性。我们在两个公共基准测试中对视网膜血管分割进行了评估，显示出在连接性和连续性保持方面的显着改进。",
