    "translated_abstract": "随着GPS设备和数据采集技术的部署，大量的GPS轨迹数据为推进时空数据挖掘研究提供了核心支持。但是，GPS轨迹包括个人地理位置信息，因此不可避免地涉及到隐私问题。解决此问题的一种有前途的方法是使用轨迹生成，用生成的无隐私信息替换原始数据。然而，由于人类活动的复杂和随机行为，生成高质量的轨迹仍处于初级阶段。为了实现这一目标，我们提出了一个基于扩散的轨迹生成（Diff-Traj）框架，有效地将扩散模型的生成能力与轨迹的时空特征学习相结合。具体地，我们通过前向轨迹噪声处理逐渐将真实轨迹转换为噪声。然后，Diff-Traj从噪声重构伪造的轨迹。",
