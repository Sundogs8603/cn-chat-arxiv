    "translated_abstract": "非直视路径（NLOS）定位是许多无线网络应用的关键问题。缺乏可用数据集使得利用机器学习方法解决NLOS定位问题变得困难，但是近期合成数据集生成的新发展为研究提供了新机遇。本文探讨了三种不同的输入表示方法：（i）单个无线电路径特征，（ii）无线电链路特征（多径），和（iii）基于图像的表示。在后两种新的表示方法的启发下，我们设计了两个卷积神经网络（CNNs），并且尽管没有显著提高NLOS定位性能，他们能够支持更丰富的预测输出，从而使预测结果深入分析。特别是，更丰富的输出能够可靠地识别出不可靠的预测，并支持给定实例的前K个候选位置的预测。我们还测量了不同表示的不确定性，展示了基于图像的表示方式能够获得更好的不确定性估计。",
