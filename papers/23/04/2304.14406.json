    "abstract": "We study the problem of inferring scene affordances by presenting a method for realistically inserting people into scenes. Given a scene image with a marked region and an image of a person, we insert the person into the scene while respecting the scene affordances. Our model can infer the set of realistic poses given the scene context, re-pose the reference person, and harmonize the composition. We set up the task in a self-supervised fashion by learning to re-pose humans in video clips. We train a large-scale diffusion model on a dataset of 2.4M video clips that produces diverse plausible poses while respecting the scene context. Given the learned human-scene composition, our model can also hallucinate realistic people and scenes when prompted without conditioning and also enables interactive editing. A quantitative evaluation shows that our method synthesizes more realistic human appearance and more natural human-scene interactions than prior work.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了推断场景可供性的问题，提出了一种实现在场景中插入人的方法。给定有标记区域的场景图像和一个人的图像，我们将这个人插入到场景中，并尊重场景可供性。我们的模型可以根据场景上下文推断出一组现实的姿态，重新调整参考人的姿态，并调和构图。我们通过学习在视频剪辑中重新姿态人类来以自我监督的方式设置任务。我们在一组包含 240 万个视频剪辑的数据集上使用大规模扩散模型进行训练，该模型会产生多样的合理姿态，同时尊重场景上下文。鉴于学习到的人 - 场景组合，我们的模型还可以在没有条件的情况下感应到真实的人和场景，以及启用交互式编辑。定量评估显示出，与以前的工作相比，我们的方法合成了更真实的人类外观和更自然的人 - 场景交互。",
