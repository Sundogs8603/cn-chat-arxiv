    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在视觉问答（VQA）任务中起到了至关重要的作用，研究一般集中在提高模型准确性方面。然而，近来有一个趋势是对这些模型在面对敌对攻击（adversarial attacks）时进行鲁棒性评估。这涉及到在输入的不同噪声水平下评估VQA模型的准确性，可以针对图像或建议的查询问题（即主问题）进行攻击。然而，目前对VQA领域这个方面缺乏适当的分析。本文提出了一种新方法，利用语义相关的问题（称为基础问题）作为噪声来评估VQA模型的鲁棒性。研究者提出当基础问题与主问题的相似度降低时，噪声水平会增加。为了产生适当的噪声水平，一组基础问题会根据其与主问题的相似度进行排名，这个排名代表引入VQA系统中的噪声水平。此外，该方法还包括上下文学习，在这个过程中VQA模型被训练了主问题和相关的基础问题。在两个VQA数据集上的实验结果显示，所提出的方法显著提高了VQA模型的鲁棒性和准确性。",
