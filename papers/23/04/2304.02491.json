    "translated_abstract": "深度学习的最新发展已经产生了能够高精度地将自然语言和基于代码提示生成源代码的代码生成模型。这可能会在课堂上产生深刻的影响，在那里初学者学习编程可以使用免费工具自动建议编程练习和作业的解决方案。然而，目前对初学者如何实际操作这些工具还知之甚少。我们提出了第一项研究，观察了初学者使用一种代码自动生成工具 Github Copilot 在典型的入门级编程（CS1）作业上的情况。通过观察和采访，我们探讨了学生对于这种学习技术的利弊的感知，介绍了新的观察到的交互模式，并讨论了学生面临的认知和元认知困难。我们考虑了这些发现的设计影响，特别是在如何更好地支持 Copilot 等工具方面。",
