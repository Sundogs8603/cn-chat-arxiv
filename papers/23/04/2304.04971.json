    "translated_abstract": "生成模型（如生成对抗网络（GANs）和变分自动编码器（VAEs））被广泛应用于建模用户交互的生成过程。然而，这些生成模型存在固有的局限性，如GANs的不稳定性和VAEs的受限表征能力。这些限制妨碍了复杂用户交互生成过程的准确建模，例如由各种干扰因素导致的嘈杂交互。考虑到扩散模型（DMs）在图像合成方面相对于传统的生成模型具有显着优势，我们提出了一种新颖的扩散推荐模型（称为DiffRec），以逐步去噪的方式学习生成过程。为了保留用户交互中的个性化信息，DiffRec减少了添加的噪声，并避免将用户交互损坏为像图像合成中的纯噪声。此外，我们扩展了传统的DMs以应对实际推荐系统中的独特挑战，如冷启动问题和稀疏的用户-物品交互数据。在几个真实数据集上的实验结果表明，DiffRec在推荐准确性和稳健性方面优于现有方法。",
