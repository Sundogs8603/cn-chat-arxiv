    "translated_abstract": "为了提高服务质量，公司为客户提供与代理人进行交互的机会，其中大部分交流是基于文本的。这已成为近年来客户与公司交流的最受欢迎的渠道之一。然而，联系中心面临运营挑战，因为客户体验的常见代理，例如是否知道客户已放弃排队和他们等待服务的意愿（耐心），受到信息不确定性的影响。我们的研究聚焦于主要不确定性来源的影响：客户的无声放弃。这些客户在等待回答他们的查询时离开系统，但没有给出任何指示，例如关闭互动的移动应用程序。因此，系统不知道他们已经离开，并浪费代理人的时间和能力，直到意识到这一事实。本文表明，放弃客户中的30％-67％放弃时会采取无声放弃策略。",
