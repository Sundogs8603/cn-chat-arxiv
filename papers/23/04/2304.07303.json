    "abstract": "Since its establishment in 1999, the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT3) has served as a transportation option for numerous passengers in Metro Manila, Philippines. The Philippine government's transportation department records more than a thousand people using the MRT3 daily and forecasting the daily passenger count may be rather challenging. The MRT3's daily ridership fluctuates owing to variables such as holidays, working days, and other unexpected issues. Commuters do not know how many other commuters are on their route on a given day, which may hinder their ability to plan an efficient itinerary. Currently, the DOTr depends on spreadsheets containing historical data, which might be challenging to examine. This study presents a time series prediction of daily traffic to anticipate future attendance at a particular station on specific days.",

    "translated_abstract": "自1999年建立以来，菲律宾马尼拉地铁三号线（MRT3）为众多乘客提供了交通选择。菲律宾政府交通部记录每天有超过一千人使用MRT3，预测每天的乘客数量可能相当具有挑战性，受假期、工作日和其他意外问题等变量影响，MRT3的日常乘客量波动较大。乘客无法知道某一天他们所乘路线上有多少其他乘客，这可能会妨碍他们规划高效行程的能力。目前，菲律宾交通运输部依赖包含历史数据的电子表格，这可能难以检查。本研究提出了一种时间序列预测模型，可以预测特定日期某个车站的未来出勤人数。",
