    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT最近受到了公众和学术界的关注，因为它能够生成合理且听起来像人类回答的各种问题的文本答案。 ChatGPT在学术或课堂环境中回答各种问题甚至生成整篇论文的潜在用途或滥用受到了关注。尽管最近的研究探讨了ChatGPT在人文学科、商学院或医学院的应用，但本研究探讨了ChatGPT在计算机工程入门课程中的表现。本研究评估了ChatGPT在入门级计算机工程课程中回答测验、作业、考试和实验室问题的适应能力。本研究发现，ChatGPT在询问普通概念的问题上表现良好。然而，显然，作为一个仅限于文本的工具，它无法处理具有图表或图形的问题，也无法生成图表和图形。同时，这个工具也无法进行实验室的现场操作。",
