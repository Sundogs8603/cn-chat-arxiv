    "abstract": "ChatGPT (GPT) has become one of the most talked-about innovations in recent years, with over 100 million users worldwide. However, there is still limited knowledge about the sources of information GPT utilizes. As a result, we carried out a study focusing on the sources of information within the field of environmental science. In our study, we asked GPT to identify the ten most significant subdisciplines within the field of environmental science. We then asked it to compose a scientific review article on each subdiscipline, including 25 references. We proceeded to analyze these references, focusing on factors such as the number of citations, publication date, and the journal in which the work was published. Our findings indicate that GPT tends to cite highly-cited publications in environmental science, with a median citation count of 1184.5. It also exhibits a preference for older publications, with a median publication year of 2010, and predominantly refers to well-respected journals ",

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT（GPT）已成为近年来最受瞩目的创新之一，全球拥有超过1亿用户。然而，关于GPT的信息来源仍知之甚少。因此，我们进行了一项研究，重点关注环境科学领域内的信息来源。在研究中，我们要求GPT识别环境科学领域内最重要的10个子学科。然后，我们要求其撰写每个子学科的科学综述文章，每篇文章包括25个参考文献。然后，我们对这些参考文献进行了分析，重点关注了引用次数、出版日期和文章所发表的期刊。我们的发现表明，GPT倾向于引用环境科学中引用次数较高的出版物，其中引用次数的中位数为1184.5。它还对较旧的出版物表现出偏好，出版年份中位数为2010年，并且主要参考备受尊重的期刊。",
