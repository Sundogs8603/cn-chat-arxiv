In this paper, we report a feasibility study of building a multi-task CT large image-text (LIT) model for lung cancer diagnosis by combining an LLM and a large image model (LIM). Specifically, the LLM and LIM are used as encoders to perceive multi-modal information under task-specific text prompts, which synergizes multi-source information and task-specific and patient-specific priors for optimized diagnostic performance. The key components of our LIT model and associated techniques are evaluated with an emphasis on 3D lung CT analysis.
