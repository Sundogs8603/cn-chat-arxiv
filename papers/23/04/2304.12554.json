    "translated_abstract": "我们针对带有交互（不可观测）个体效应的网络数据线性回归模型提出了一种速率最优的估计器。该估计器相比标准估计器的$ \\sqrt {N}$ 收敛速率实现了更快的收敛速率 $N$ ，且在我们讨论的情况下是有效的。我们观察到个体效应以显著和独特的方式改变了数据矩阵表示的特征值分布。因此，我们提供了一种校正“普通最小二乘”目标函数的方法，以减弱由于个体效应而引起的统计噪声，并在某些情况下完全消除它。新的估计器是渐近正态的，并且我们提供了其渐近协方差矩阵的有效估计器。虽然本文仅研究考虑个体效应一阶交互的模型，但我们的估计过程自然可扩展到更高阶交互和误差项更一般的规范。",

By correcting the ordinary least squares' objective function, this technique efficiently resolves the noise issue caused by individual effects and offers faster convergence rates. The estimator is asymptotically normal, and the estimation procedure is potentially extendable to higher-order interactions and more general specifications of the error terms."
