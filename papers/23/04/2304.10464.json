    "translated_abstract": "大语言模型在各种基本自然语言任务中表现出卓越性能，这引起了实现人工通用智能的希望。为了更好地完成复杂任务，我们需要利用大语言模型进行编程，然后按照程序生成特定的解决方案。我们提出使用自然语言作为一种新的编程语言来描述任务过程，使它们易于人类和大语言模型理解。虽然大语言模型能够直接生成自然语言程序，但这些程序可能仍然存在错误或不完整的步骤。因此，我们进一步提出了学习编程（LP）的方法，要求大语言模型从复杂任务的训练数据集中学习自然语言程序，然后使用学习到的程序来指导推理。我们在AMPS（高中数学）和Math（竞赛数学问题）数据集上的实验证明了我们方法的有效性。在测试ChatGP解决编程任务时，LP能够实现80%的成功率，优于基线方法。",
