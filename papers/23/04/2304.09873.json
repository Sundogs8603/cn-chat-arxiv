    "abstract": "This paper proposes using ChatGPT, an innovative technology with various applications, as an assistant for psychotherapy. ChatGPT can serve as a patient information collector, a companion for patients in between therapy sessions, and an organizer of gathered information for therapists to facilitate treatment processes. The research identifies five research questions and discovers useful prompts for fine-tuning the assistant, which shows that ChatGPT can participate in positive conversations, listen attentively, offer validation and potential coping strategies without providing explicit medical advice, and help therapists discover new insights from multiple conversations with the same patient. Using ChatGPT as an assistant for psychotherapy poses several challenges that need to be addressed, including technical as well as human-centric challenges which are discussed.",
