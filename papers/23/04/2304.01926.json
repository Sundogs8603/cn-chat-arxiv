    "translated_abstract": "随着越来越多地将数据编码为向量以提供在线推荐和搜索用例，机器学习的使用呈递增趋势。因此，最近的数据管理系统提供了在线向量相似度搜索的查询处理增强方法。在本研究中，我们探讨了在知识图谱（KGs）中进行向量相似性搜索的方法。在查询已有KG查询工作负载相关的KG查询和实体任务的驱动下，我们专注于混合向量相似度搜索（混合查询），其中查询的一部分对应向量相似度搜索，而查询的另一部分对应与底层数据向量相关的关系属性。例如，给定过去为歌曲实体的KG查询，我们希望构建新的查询，以寻找向量表示接近过去KG查询中的实体向量表示的新歌曲实体。但是，在KG中的实体也具有非向量属性，例如与艺术家相关的歌曲。",
