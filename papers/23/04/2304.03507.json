    "abstract": "In graph neural networks (GNNs), both node features and labels are examples of graph signals, a key notion in graph signal processing (GSP). While it is common in GSP to impose signal smoothness constraints in learning and estimation tasks, it is unclear how this can be done for discrete node labels. We bridge this gap by introducing the concept of distributional graph signals. In our framework, we work with the distributions of node labels instead of their values and propose notions of smoothness and non-uniformity of such distributional graph signals. We then propose a general regularization method for GNNs that allows us to encode distributional smoothness and non-uniformity of the model output in semi-supervised node classification tasks. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of most base GNN models in different problem settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "在图神经网络(GNN)中，节点特征和标签都是图信号处理(GSP)中的重要概念。虽然在学习和估计任务中，GSP中通常会施加信号平滑性约束，但如何针对离散的节点标签实现这一点尚不清楚。本文通过引入分布式图信号的概念解决了这一问题。在我们的框架中，我们使用节点标签的分布而不是值，并提出了这种分布式图信号的平滑性和非均匀性概念。然后，我们提出了一种通用的GNN正则化方法，允许我们在半监督节点分类任务中对模型输出的分布式平滑性和非均匀性进行编码。数值实验表明，我们的方法可以显著提高不同问题设置中的大多数基本GNN模型的性能。",
