    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们将不同的统计模型应用于美国经济季度国内生产总值（GDP）增长预测。使用每月的FRED-MD数据库，我们比较了动态因子模型（DFM）和四个人工神经网络（ANNs）的预测表现：多层感知机（MLP）、一维卷积神经网络（1D CNN）、长短期记忆网络（LSTM）和门控循环单元（GRU）。实证分析呈现了两个不同评估周期的结果。第一个周期（2010年第1季度至2019年第4季度）具有平衡的经济增长，而第二个周期（2010年第1季度至2022年第3季度）还包括COVID-19衰退期间的时间。根据我们的结果，更长的输入序列在平衡经济增长期间能够实现更准确的预测。然而，在一个相对较低的阈值值（约六个季度或十八个月）以后，这种效应会消失。在经济动荡期（如COVID-19衰退期间），长期记忆的效果会变得较为明显。",
