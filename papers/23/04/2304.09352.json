    "translated_abstract": "为了应对全球变暖和减缓与气候变化相关的风险，碳捕集和封存技术（CCS）已经成为一项关键技术。然而，将CO2安全地封存在地质层中长期储存存在着一些挑战。在这项研究中，我们将碳储存操作的决策过程建模为部分可观察的马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP），并使用信念状态规划来优化注入器和监测井的位置，以最大程度地储存CO2，同时保持安全。仿真实验的实证结果表明，我们的方法有效地确保了安全的长期碳储存操作。我们展示了我们的方法的灵活性，通过引入三种不同的监测策略，并研究它们对决策质量的影响。此外，我们引入了一个用于处理POMDP决策过程复杂动态的神经网络代理模型。",
