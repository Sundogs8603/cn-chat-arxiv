    "abstract": "This study delves into the origins of excess capacity by examining the reactions of capital, labor, and capital intensity. To achieve this, we have employed a novel three-layered production function model, estimating the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor as a nested layer, alongside capital intensity, for all industry groups. We have then selectively analyzed a few industry groups for comparative purposes, taking into account the current government policies and manufacturing plant realities. Ultimately, we recommend that policymakers address the issue of excess capacity by stimulating the expansion of manufacturing plants with cutting-edge machinery. Our findings and recommendations are intended to appeal to academics and policymakers alike.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究通过研究资本、劳动和资本密集度的反应，探讨了过剩产能的起源。为了实现此目的，我们采用了一种新颖的三层生产函数模型，估计了所有产业组之间资本和劳动替代弹性的嵌套层，同时考虑了资本密集度。我们对几个产业组进行了选择性分析，以进行比较，考虑到当前的政府政策和制造厂的实际情况。最终，我们建议政策制定者通过激活采用先进机器设备扩大制造厂的规模来解决过剩产能的问题。我们的发现和建议旨在吸引学者和政策制定者的关注。",
