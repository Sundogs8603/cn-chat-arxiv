    "translated_abstract": "近年来，机器学习、分布式计算和大数据技术推动了进化计算(EC)的发展，使得EC的研究方向不断拓展，比如分布式的EC和基于替代模型的EC。这些进展显著提高了EC的性能和应用范围，但也会导致隐私泄露，比如最优结果和替代模型的泄露。因此，进化计算与隐私保护成为新兴的研究方向。然而，目前进化计算中隐私问题的系统性研究尚不完善，特别是缺乏隐私保护的对象、动机、位置和方法的探索。因此，在本文中，我们讨论了三种典型的优化模式(即集中式优化、分布式优化和数据驱动优化)来表征进化计算的优化模式，并提出了BOOM来整理进化计算中的隐私问题。具体而言，BOOM包括四个部分：隐私保护的定义、隐私问题的分类、隐私感知的进化计算的构建以及通过案例展示隐私感知的进化计算。我们希望BOOM能够作为一个指南，美学地分析进化计算中的隐私问题，并在未来的研究中推动隐私感知的优化。",
