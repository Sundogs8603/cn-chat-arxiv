The challenge received eight unique submissions that outperformed the provided SotA baseline on any of the pointcloud- or image-based metrics.

Supervised submissions generally leveraged large collections of datasets to improve data diversity. Self-supervised submissions instead updated the network architecture and pretrained backbones.
