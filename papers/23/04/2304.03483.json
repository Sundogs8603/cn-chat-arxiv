    "translated_abstract": "动态成像是指利用被欠采样的测量数据恢复每个时间点上的时变二维或三维物体。尤其是在动态断层扫描中，每个时间点上只有一个视角下的单个投影可用，使得问题严重算不可逆。本文提出了一种称为RED-PSM的方法，首次将两种强大的技术结合起来解决这个具有挑战性的成像问题。第一种技术是部分可分模型，已经用于高效地为时空目标引入低秩先验。第二种是最近提出的去噪正则化(RED)，它提供了一种灵活的框架，利用最先进的图像去噪算法处理各种反问题。我们提出了一个带正则化的部分可分目标，通过变量分裂和ADMM优化方案，并证明了我们的目标收敛于一个满足优化问题的稳定点。我们通过在具有挑战性的动态断层扫描问题上进行了大量的数值实验，证明了所提出的RED-PSM方法的优越性，相较于现有的动态成像技术。",
