    "translated_abstract": "非线性相互作用的系统组件经常引入不稳定性，产生具有新属性和不同时空尺度的现象。这被称为自发自组织，是在远离热力学平衡的系统中普遍存在的。我们引入了一个理论基础的框架，用于通过数据驱动的算法实现自然组织。它的基本构件是通过局部交互捕获信息在系统中传播方式的时空光锥。我们展示了预测光锥等价类——局部因果状态——捕获复杂时空系统中的有序行为和相干结构。通过我们的无监督物理启示的机器学习算法和高性能计算实现，我们展示了局部因果状态在实际领域科学问题中的适用性。我们展示了局部因果状态捕获旋涡及其功率的情况，这些是自然和工程领域中普遍存在的现象。",
