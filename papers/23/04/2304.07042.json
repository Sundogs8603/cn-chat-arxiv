    "translated_abstract": "连续时间序列推荐旨在通过捕获用户过去交互中的项购买序列，理解用户的偏好。现有方法通常通过建模顺序模式来预测下一个项目。尽管有效，然而存在两个天然不足：（i）用户偏好具有动态性，并且经常忽略协作信号的演化；（ii）观察到的交互通常是不规则采样的，而现有方法则假设均匀间隔来进行项目转换建模。因此，如何有效地对用户偏好的基础动态建模和预测成为一个关键的研究问题。为了解决上述挑战，本文关注于连续时间序列推荐，提出了一种基于图正则微分方程（graph ordinary differential equation, GDERec）的连续时间序列推荐框架。技术上，GDERec由一个自回归图正则微分方程组成，通过连续时间图卷积网络来建模项转移动态。在四个真实数据集上的实证结果表明，GDERec显著优于现有方法，并提供了连续时间用户偏好动态的可解释见解。",

    "en_tdlr": "A graph ordinary differential equation framework named GDERec is proposed for continuous-time sequential recommendation, which models the dynamics of item transitions via a continuous-time graph convolutional network and addresses the challenges of collaborative signal evolution and irregular sampling. Empirical results on four real-world datasets show that GDERec significantly outperforms existing methods and provides interpretable insights into the continuous-time dynamics of user preference."
