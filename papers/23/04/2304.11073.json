    "abstract": "Though Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is a core component of spoken dialogue systems, recent work on this task mostly deals with chat corpora, disregarding the discrepancies between spoken and written language.In this paper, we propose OLISIA, a cascade system which integrates an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model and a DST model. We introduce several adaptations in the ASR and DST modules to improve integration and robustness to spoken conversations.With these adaptations, our system ranked first in DSTC11 Track 3, a benchmark to evaluate spoken DST. We conduct an in-depth analysis of the results and find that normalizing the ASR outputs and adapting the DST inputs through data augmentation, along with increasing the pre-trained models size all play an important role in reducing the performance discrepancy between written and spoken conversations.",

    "translated_abstract": "对话状态跟踪 (DST) 是口语对话系统的核心组成部分。然而，最近关于该任务的研究大多集中于聊天时的语料库，忽略了口语和书面语之间的差异。本文提出了 OLISIA，这是一个级联系统，它集成了自动语音识别 (ASR) 模型和 DST 模型。我们在 ASR 和 DST 模块中引入了几个适应性策略，以提高对口语对话的整合性和稳健性。经过这些策略的调整，我们的系统在 DSTC11 Track 3 中排名第一，这是一个评估口语 DST 性能的基准。我们进行了深入的结果分析，发现规范化 ASR 的输出和通过数据增强调整 DST 的输入，以及增加预训练模型的大小，都在降低书面和口语对话之间性能差异方面发挥了重要作用。",
