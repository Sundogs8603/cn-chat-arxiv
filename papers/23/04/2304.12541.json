    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种利用物理信息可逆神经网络(PI-INN)解决贝叶斯反问题的新方法。PI-INN的结构包括两个子网络：一个可逆神经网络(INN)和一个神经基础网络(NB-Net)。通过NB-Net帮助建立参数输入和INN输出之间的可逆映射，以提供可行的后验分布估计，从而实现高效的抽样和准确的密度评估。此外，PI-INN的损失函数包含两个部分：一部分是基于残差的物理信息损失项，另一部分是新的独立性损失项。提出的独立性损失项可以高斯化随机潜变量，并通过有效利用估计的密度函数，确保INN输出的两个部分之间的统计独立性。通过进行反向运动学和反向扩散等多项实验验证了所提出的PI-INN的有效性和准确性。",
