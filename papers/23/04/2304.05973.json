    "translated_abstract": "综合的生物医学知识库可以增强医学决策过程，需要通过统一的索引系统融合来自不同来源的知识图谱。索引系统通常以层次结构组织生物医学术语，以提供细粒度的对齐实体。为了解决生物医学知识融合 (BKF) 任务中监督不足的挑战，研究人员提出了各种无监督方法。然而，这些方法严重依赖于特定的词汇和结构匹配算法，无法捕捉生物医学实体和术语所传达的丰富语义。最近，神经嵌入模型在语义丰富的任务中被证明是有效的，但它们依赖于充足标记数据进行充分训练。为了弥补稀缺标记 BKF 和神经嵌入模型之间的差距，我们提出了 HiPrompt，一个监督效率高的知识融合框架，可以引发大规模语义推理的少样本推理能力。",
