    "translated_abstract": "自注意机制是序列推荐领域广泛使用的技术之一，具有建模长程依赖性的强大能力。然而，许多最近的研究表明，目前基于自注意力的模型是低通滤波器，不能捕捉高频信息。此外，由于用户行为中的项目相互交织，这些模型无法区分时间域中模糊的固有周期性。在这项工作中，我们将视角转移到频率域，并提出了一种新颖的序列推荐算法——频率增强的混合注意力网络，即FEARec。在这个模型中，我们首先通过一个斜坡结构将原始时间域自注意力改进到频率域中，使得我们的方法可以明确地学习低频和高频信息。此外，我们还通过自相关设计了类似的注意力机制来捕捉用户行为的固有周期性。在四个真实世界的基准测试中进行了大量实验，结果表明我们提出的方法比现有最先进的方法表现更优秀。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel sequential recommendation model, FEARec, that shifts the attention mechanism from the time domain to the frequency domain, enabling explicit learning of both low- and high-frequency information. The model also includes an attention mechanism that captures the inherent periodicity of user behaviors through auto-correlation. Experimental results show that FEARec outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four real-world benchmarks."
