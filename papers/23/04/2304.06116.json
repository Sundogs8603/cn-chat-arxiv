    "translated_abstract": "短视频在新的社交媒体趋势中爆发性地流行起来。镜头边界检测（SBD）是各种场景中最基本的组成部分之一，对于视频内容的创建和理解至关重要。 在本研究中，我们发布了一个名为SHOT的新的公共短视频镜头边界检测数据集，包括853个完整的短视频和11,606个镜头注释，其中包括200个测试视频中的2,716个高质量的镜头边界注释。利用这个新的数据财富，我们提出了一种名为AutoShot的方法，通过在包含各种先进的3D ConvNets和Transformers的搜索空间中进行神经架构搜索，来优化镜头边界检测模型的设计。我们的方法在F1分数上比先前的最先进方法实现了更高的准确性，例如在超过TransNetV2 4.2％的情况下获得更好的性能。",
