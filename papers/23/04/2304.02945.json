    "translated_abstract": "调查中的开放性问题具有重要价值，因为它们不会限制受访者的答案，从而避免偏见。然而，开放问题的答案是文本数据，更难分析。传统上，答案按照编码手册中指定的方式手动分类。大部分自动编码的工作都集中在单标签预测上，其中答案被分为一个标签。然而，需要多标签分类的开放式问题（即分配多个代码的问题）经常发生。本文针对社会科学调查中开放问卷调查的文本答案进行多标签分类研究。我们针对德语使用基于转换器的架构BERT进行性能评估，与传统的多标签算法（二进制相关性、标签幂集、ECC）进行比较，针对德国社会科学调查GLES Panel（N=17,584，55个标签）进行研究。我们发现，在BERT的分类下（强制至少一个标签），多标签文本问题的分类性能比传统算法更优秀。",
