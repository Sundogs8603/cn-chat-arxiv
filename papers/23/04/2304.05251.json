    "abstract": "We use algorithmic and network-based tools to build and analyze the bipartite network connecting jobs with the skills they require. We quantify and represent the relatedness between jobs and skills by using statistically validated networks. Using the fitness and complexity algorithm, we compute a skill-based complexity of jobs. This quantity is positively correlated with the average salary, abstraction, and non-routinarity level of jobs. Furthermore, coherent jobs - defined as the ones requiring closely related skills - have, on average, lower wages. We find that salaries may not always reflect the intrinsic value of a job, but rather other wage-setting dynamics that may not be directly related to its skill composition. Our results provide valuable information for policymakers, employers, and individuals to better understand the dynamics of the labor market and make informed decisions about their careers.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们使用算法和基于网络的工具来构建和分析将工作与所需技能相连的二分网络。我们使用经过统计验证的网络来量化和代表工作与技能之间的相关性。使用适应度和复杂度算法，我们计算出了工作的基于技能的复杂度。该数量与工作的平均工资、抽象性和非例行性水平呈正相关。此外，具有一致技能要求的工作平均工资较低。我们发现，工资并不总是反映工作的内在价值，而可能是其他工资设定动态的结果，这些动态可能与其技能组合没有直接的关系。我们的结果为决策制定者、雇主和个人提供了有价值的信息，以更好地了解劳动力市场的动态并做出关于他们职业生涯的明智决策。",
