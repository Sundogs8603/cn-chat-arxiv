    "abstract": "This paper provides answers to an open problem: given a nonlinear data-driven dynamical system model, e.g., kernel conditional mean embedding (CME) and Koopman operator, how can one propagate the ambiguity sets forward for multiple steps? This problem is the key to solving distributionally robust control and learning-based control of such learned system models under a data-distribution shift. Different from previous works that use either static ambiguity sets, e.g., fixed Wasserstein balls, or dynamic ambiguity sets under known piece-wise linear (or affine) dynamics, we propose an algorithm that exactly propagates ambiguity sets through nonlinear data-driven models using the Koopman operator and CME, via the kernel maximum mean discrepancy geometry. Through both theoretical and numerical analysis, we show that our kernel ambiguity sets are the natural geometric structure for the learned data-driven dynamical system models.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了一个开放问题：给定一个非线性的数据驱动动力学系统模型，如内核条件均值嵌入和Koopman算子，如何在多个步骤中向前传播歧义集合？这个问题是解决分布式鲁棒控制和基于学习的控制在数据分布转移下的关键。与先前使用静态歧义集合（例如固定的Wasserstein球）或在已知分段线性（或仿射）动力学下使用动态歧义集合的作品不同，我们提出了一种算法，通过Koopman算子和CME，通过内核最大均值差几何传递歧义集合。通过理论和数字分析，我们表明，我们的内核歧义集合是学习的数据驱动动力学系统模型的自然几何结构。",
