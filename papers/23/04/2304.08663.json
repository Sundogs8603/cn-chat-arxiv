    "translated_abstract": "跳跃对于腿式机器人通过困难地形至关重要。在本文中，我们提出了一个层次化框架，结合最优控制和强化学习，为四足机器人学习连续跳跃动作。我们的框架的核心是一个姿态控制器，它将手动设计的加速度控制器与学习到的剩余策略结合在一起。由于加速度控制器为高效训练warm start策略，所以经过训练的策略克服了加速度控制器的局限并提高了跳跃稳定性。此外，一个低层全身控制器将姿势控制器的身体姿势命令转换成电机命令。经过在模拟环境下的训练后，我们的框架可以直接部署到真实机器人上，执行多功能的连续跳跃动作，包括高达50cm、向前60cm的全向跳跃和高达90度的跳跃转向。请访问我们的网站以获取更多结果:https://sites.google.com/view/jumping-rl/home",
