While disambiguating scale during training is not possible without some kind of ground truth supervision, having scale consistent depth predictions would make it possible to calculate scale once during inference as a post-processing step and use it over-time.

    "translated_abstract": "自监督单目深度估计方法不仅存在尺度歧义，而且在尺度方面的深度图推断不一致。尽管在训练过程中消除尺度歧义是不可能的，但是有一致的尺度预测可以在推断期间计算一次，然后在时间内使用。为了实现这一目标，引入了一组时间一致性损失，以在时间上最小化姿态不一致性。评估结果显示，引入这些约束不仅减少了深度不一致性，而且提高了深度和自我运动预测的基线性能。",
