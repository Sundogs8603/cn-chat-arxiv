The need to develop ChatGPT-written content detection algorithms call for large-scale datasets. In this paper, we initially investigate the possible negative impact of ChatGPT on academia,and present a large-scale CHatGPT-writtEn AbsTract dataset (CHEAT) to support the development of detection algorithms. In particular, the ChatGPT-written abstract dataset contains 35,304 synthetic abstracts, with Generation, Polish, and Mix as prominent representatives. Based on these data, we perform a thorough analysis of the existing text synthesis detection algorithms. We show that ChatGPT-written abstracts are detectable, while the detection difficulty increases with human involvement.Our dataset is available in https://gith",

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT的强大能力引起了学术界的广泛关注。恶意用户可以通过ChatGPT合成虚假的学术内容，这对学术的严谨性和原创性造成了极大的伤害。有必要开发ChatGPT生成内容检测算法，需要大规模数据集的支持。本文首次研究了ChatGPT对学术界可能造成的负面影响，并提出了一个大规模的ChatGPT生成摘要数据集（CHEAT）来支持检测算法的开发。其中，ChatGPT生成的摘要数据集包含35,304个合成摘要，其代表有Generation, Polish, 和 Mix。基于这些数据，我们对现有的文本合成检测算法进行了彻底分析。我们展示了ChatGPT生成的摘要是可以被检测出来的，而检测难度随着人类参与的增加而增加。我们的数据集可以在https://gith上找到。",
