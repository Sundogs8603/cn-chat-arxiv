    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种用于分析高维数据集的新型正则化鲁棒 $\\tau$-回归估计器，以应对响应变量和协变量的严重污染。我们称这种估计器为自适应 $\\tau$-Lasso，它对异常值和高杠杆点具有鲁棒性，同时采用自适应 $\\ell_1$-范数惩罚项来减少真实回归系数的偏差。具体而言，该自适应 $\\ell_1$-范数惩罚项为每个回归系数分配一个权重。对于固定数量的预测变量 $p$，我们显示出自适应 $\\tau$-Lasso 具有变量选择一致性和真实支持下回归向量的渐近正态性的最优性质，假定已知真实回归向量的支持。然后我们通过有限样本断点和影响函数来表征其健壮性。我们进行了广泛的模拟来比较不同的估计器的性能。",
