    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑利用通过学习增强的感知地图从高维传感器测量中获得的状态估计的感知控制。但是，这些感知地图并不完美，会导致状态估计误差，这可能导致不安全的系统行为。随机传感器噪声会使情况变得更糟，并导致遵循未知分布的估计误差。我们提出了一个感知控制框架，它: i）量化了感知地图的估计不确定性，并ii）将这些不确定性表示集成到控制设计中。为此，我们使用置信度预测来计算有效的状态估计区域，这些区域是高概率包含未知状态的集合。然后，我们基于测量鲁棒控制障碍函数的概念设计了连续时间系统的采样数据控制器。我们的控制器使用了自触发控制的思想，并使我们避免使用随机微积分。我们的框架是一种易于实现和可扩展的方法，可以保证系统的安全性和有效性。",
