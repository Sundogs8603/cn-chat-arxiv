    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一些关于网络空间通信的新的代数和几何视角。我们的主要贡献是对时间变化图（TVG）的新定义，该定义采用实线集合P（R）中的矩阵值进行表示。我们利用P（R）的半环性质，使用矩阵乘法和截断的克莱尼星号来建模TVG中的多跳通信。这导致了对TVG的通信容量的新型统计量，称为寿命曲线，我们通过对大样本的随机选择的STARLINK卫星进行日长模拟来生成这些统计数据。我们还引入了一些基于拓扑数据分析（TDA）启发的新度量标准来进一步分析确定大样本的STARLINK在时空上的强连接性。为了更好地模拟地球和火星之间的网络情景，我们引入了能够模拟传播延迟以及延迟容忍网络中常见协议的各种半环。",
