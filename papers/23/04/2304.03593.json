    "translated_abstract": "传统的基于地图的机器人导航方法在拥挤环境中往往会遇到“冻结机器人问题”。深度强化学习方法解决了此问题，但是存在泛化和可扩展性的问题。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出一种使用“碰撞概率”来帮助机器人安全通过人群的方法。将“碰撞概率”包括在观察空间中，给机器人提供了一个感知移动人群的危险程度的能力。机器人会在看似安全的情况下穿过人群，但在人群移动过于激烈时会绕路。通过关注最危险的障碍物，机器人不会在人群密度较高时混淆，确保模型的可扩展性。我们的方法使用深度强化学习(DRL)开发，并在Gazebo模拟器中进行了非合作人群环境中的训练，其中的障碍物以随机速度移动。",
