    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了基于强大深度学习技术的 Deep Learning Vulnerability Analyzer （DLVA），它是一种针对以字节码为基础的以太坊智能合约的漏洞检测工具。我们在没有手动特征工程、预定义模式或专家规则的情况下，将源代码分析扩展到字节码，训练DLVA判断字节码。DLVA训练算法的鲁棒性也很强：它克服了1.25%误标记合约的错误率，学生超越了老师，并发现了Slither误标记的易受攻击的合约。DLVA比基于形式方法的传统智能合约漏洞检测工具快得多：DLVA检查了29个漏洞所需的时间为0.2秒，速度提高了10-500倍。DLVA有三个关键组成部分：Smart Contract to Vector（SC2Vec）将智能合约转换为深度学习模型的向量表示。Bytecode Tokenizer（BCT）将底层字节码转换为神经网络的有意义的标记，DLVA是神经网络模型，可预测智能合约是否包含漏洞。我们对Etherscan的28,505个经过验证的智能合约数据集进行了DLVA评估，发现它取得了0.964的AUC（真阳率/假阳率曲线下的面积）得分。与基线方法相比，DLVA在F1分数上显示了30.7%的改进，它是精度和召回的调和平均值。",
