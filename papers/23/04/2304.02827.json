    "translated_abstract": "高质量的3D内容创作需求不断增加，促使人们开发从单个图像和/或文本提示中创建3D对象模型的自动化方法。然而，使用最先进的图像到3D方法重建的3D对象对给定图像的对应性和多视图一致性仍然不足。最近的最先进的文本到3D方法也有局限性，每个提示得到的3D样本多样性低，合成时间长。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了DITTO-NeRF，一种从文本提示或单个图像生成高质量3D NeRF模型的新型流程。我们的DITTO-NeRF包括使用给定或文本生成的2D图像从前方视图构建有限的高质量局部3D对象，然后通过补全潜在扩散模型迭代重建其余的3D NeRF。我们提出了逐步的3D对象重建方案，涵盖不同的尺度(低分辨率到高分辨率)。",
