    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的人意识到需要完全人类可理解的模型，这是人工智能研究的一个核心主题。当这些模型是可解释的时，接受人工智能模型辅助敏感领域决策的趋势将会增长，并且即将出台的法规将会加强对可解释模型的倾斜。可解释人工智能的切入点之一是医学实践，它可以受益于精确的决策支持方法，这些方法本质上会产生信任。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的方法——MedFP，它结合了概率树和模糊逻辑来辅助临床实践。该方法完全可解释，因为它允许临床医生产生、控制和验证整个诊断过程；该方法的一个优点是减少误诊率，通过提供不确定性和反事实分析的估计值。我们的方法作为概念证明应用于两个真实的医学场景中：肿瘤分类和糖尿病类型2的诊断。",
