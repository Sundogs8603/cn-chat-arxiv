    "abstract": "Despite much progress in recent years, the vast majority of work in natural language processing (NLP) is on standard languages with many speakers. In this work, we instead focus on low-resource languages and in particular non-standardized low-resource languages. Even within branches of major language families, often considered well-researched, little is known about the extent and type of available resources and what the major NLP challenges are for these language varieties. The first step to address this situation is a systematic survey of available corpora (most importantly, annotated corpora, which are particularly valuable for NLP research). Focusing on Germanic low-resource language varieties, we provide such a survey in this paper. Except for geolocation (origin of speaker or document), we find that manually annotated linguistic resources are sparse and, if they exist, mostly cover morphosyntax. Despite this lack of resources, we observe that interest in this area is increasing: t",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管近年来取得了很大进展，但自然语言处理（NLP）中的大多数工作都是针对使用广泛的标准语言。在本研究中，我们将重点放在低资源语言，特别是非标准低资源语言上。即使在被认为已得到充分研究的主要语系中，对于这些语言变体可用资源的类型和范围以及NLP的主要挑战还知之甚少。解决这种情况的第一步是系统地调查可用的语料库（最重要的是，手工注释的语料库，这对NLP研究特别有价值）。在本文中，我们针对德语低资源语言变体提供了这样的调查。除了地理位置（说话者或文档的来源）外，我们发现手工注释的语言资源稀少，如果存在，主要涵盖形态句法。尽管缺乏资源，我们观察到这一领域的兴趣正在增加：",
