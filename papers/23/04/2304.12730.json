    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes the CitePrompt framework, which utilizes prompts to identify citation intent in scientific papers. The method achieves significant improvement in classification accuracy by selecting the proper pre-trained language model, prompt template, and prompt verbalizer, while requiring minimal external information. State-of-the-art results are reported on the ACL-ARC dataset and significant improvement is shown on the SciCite dataset over all baseline models except one."
