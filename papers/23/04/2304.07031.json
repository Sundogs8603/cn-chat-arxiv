    "translated_abstract": "可见光谱数据集的利用已经使得深度网络取得了显着的成功。然而，实际应用任务包括低光照条件，这使得在大规模RGB图像数据集上训练的模型表现出性能瓶颈。热红外相机对这种情况更为稳健。因此，在实际应用中使用热成像可以是有用的。无监督域适应（UDA）允许将信息从源域转移至完全未标记的目标域。尽管UDA取得了实质性的改进，但其与其监督学习对应方法之间的性能差距仍然显著。通过选择少量目标样本进行注释并将其用于训练，主动域适应试图以最小的注释费用来缓解这种差距。我们提出了一种主动域适应方法，以检验将可见光谱与热成像模态结合的效率。当域差距明显较大时，",
