    "translated_abstract": "部分可观测问题在减少成本和收集信息之间存在平衡。可以通过在信念空间中进行规划来最优地解决这些问题，但这通常是极其昂贵的。与之相反，模型预测控制 (MPC) 采用使用状态估计器形成关于状态的信仰，然后在状态空间中进行规划的替代方法。这在规划期间忽略了潜在的未来观察结果，因此不能积极增加或保持其自身状态估计的准确性。我们在信念空间中进行规划和完全忽略其动态之间找到了一个折衷方案，只考虑其未来的准确性。我们的方法，滤波感知MPC，通过我们所谓的”追踪度“，即状态估计器的预期误差，惩罚信息损失。我们展示了基于模型的模拟可以将“追踪度”压缩成一个神经网络，从而实现快速规划。在涉及视觉导航，现实的日常环境和一个双连杆机器人的实验中，我们证明了该方法的有效性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new model predictive control method, filter-aware MPC, which penalises information loss by tracking the expected error of the state estimator, and condenses the \"trackability\" into a neural network for fast planning. Experiments show its effectiveness in visual navigation, realistic environments, and robotics."
