    "translated_abstract": "在辩论写作中，作者必须构思分层写作目标，确保其论点的说服力，并通过起草来修订和组织他们的计划。最近大型语言模型（LLM）的进展使得通过聊天界面进行交互式文本生成（例如ChatGPT）成为可能。然而，这种方法常常忽略了隐含的写作上下文和用户意图，缺乏用户控制和自主权，并且提供有限的帮助来进行意义构建和修订写作计划。为了应对这些挑战，我们引入了VISAR，一种AI支持的写作助手系统，旨在帮助作者在其写作上下文中构思和修订分层目标，通过同步文本编辑和可视化编程组织论证结构，并通过论证火花推荐增强说服力。VISAR允许用户使用自动草案原型探索、实验和验证他们的写作计划。一个受控实验室研究证实，VISAR可以通过客观和主观评估，有效地改善用户的写作体验和结果。",
    "tldr": "VISAR是一个AI写作助手，旨在帮助作者提升写作体验和输出。它可以在写作上下文中随时帮助作者构思和修改目标，通过可视化编程来组织论证结构，并提供推荐来增加说服力。自动草案原型可以用来验证计划。",
