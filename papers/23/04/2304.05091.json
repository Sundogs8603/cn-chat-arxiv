    "translated_abstract": "高斯过程（GP）通常因计算和内存需求的不利扩展而受到批评。对于大量数据集，稀疏 GP 通过在少量感应变量的条件下对数据进行总结来减少这些需求。然而，在需要许多感应变量的大型数据集（例如低长度尺度空间数据）中，即使是稀疏 GP 也可能变得计算昂贵，受使用感应变量的数量的限制。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的跨领域变量高斯过程类，通过将 GP 投影到一组紧支撑 B 样条基函数上来构建。我们方法的关键优势在于，B 样条基函数的紧支撑允许使用稀疏线性代数来显著加快矩阵运算，并大大减少存储占用。这使我们能够使用数以万计的感应变量非常有效地建模快速变化的空间现象，而先前的方法由于感应变量的使用限制而无法实现。",
