    "abstract": "Advances in mobile communication capabilities open the door for closer integration of pre-hospital and in-hospital care processes. For example, medical specialists can be enabled to guide on-site paramedics and can, in turn, be supplied with live vitals or visuals. Consolidating such performance-critical applications with the highly complex workings of mobile communications requires solutions both reliable and efficient, yet easy to integrate with existing systems. This paper explores the application of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient~(\\ddpg) methods for learning a communications resource scheduling algorithm with special regards to priority users. Unlike the popular Deep-Q-Network methods, the \\ddpg is able to produce continuous-valued output. With light post-processing, the resulting scheduler is able to achieve high performance on a flexible sum-utility goal.",

    "translated_abstract": "移动通信功能的进步为院前和院内护理过程的更紧密整合打开了大门。例如，医学专家可以指导现场医护人员，并且可以提供实时生命体征或视觉。将这种对性能至关重要的应用与移动通信的高度复杂的工作结合起来，需要可靠且高效的解决方案，同时易于与现有系统集成。本文探讨了利用深度确定性策略梯度（\\ddpg）方法学习通信资源调度算法的应用，特别是限制于优先用户。与普通的深度Q网络不同，\\ddpg 能够产生连续值的输出。经过轻微的后处理，得到的调度器能够在灵活的总和效用目标上实现高性能。",
