    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied on a variety of real-world applications, such as social recommendation. However, existing GNN-based models on social recommendation suffer from serious problems of generalization and oversmoothness, because of the underexplored negative sampling method and the direct implanting of the off-the-shelf GNN models. In this paper, we propose a succinct multi-network GNN-based neural model (NeMo) for social recommendation. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed model explores a generative negative sampling strategy, and leverages both the positive and negative user-item interactions for users' interest propagation. The experiments show that NeMo outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on various real-world benchmark datasets (e.g., by up to 38.8% in terms of NDCG@15).",

    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络在社交推荐等各类实际应用中被广泛采用。但是，现有基于图神经网络的社交推荐模型普遍存在泛化和过分平滑化的严重问题，这是由于未被充分探索的负采样方法和直接嵌入现成的图神经网络模型引起的。本文提出了一种简洁的多网络图神经网络模型（NeMo），用于社交推荐。与现有方法相比，该模型采用一种生成式的负采样策略，并利用正负用户-商品交互来进行用户兴趣传播。实验结果表明，NeMo在各种真实世界基准数据集上均优于现有基线（例如，在NDCG@15方面提高了高达38.8%）。",
