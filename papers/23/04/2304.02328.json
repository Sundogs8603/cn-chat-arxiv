    "abstract": "This paper studies the multimodal named entity recognition (MNER) and multimodal relation extraction (MRE), which are important for multimedia social platform analysis. The core of MNER and MRE lies in incorporating evident visual information to enhance textual semantics, where two issues inherently demand investigations. The first issue is modality-noise, where the task-irrelevant information in each modality may be noises misleading the task prediction. The second issue is modality-gap, where representations from different modalities are inconsistent, preventing from building the semantic alignment between the text and image. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for MNER and MRE by Multi-Modal representation learning with Information Bottleneck (MMIB). For the first issue, a refinement-regularizer probes the information-bottleneck principle to balance the predictive evidence and noisy information, yielding expressive representations for prediction.

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel method, the Multi-Modal representation learning with Information Bottleneck (MMIB), to address the challenges of incorporating visual information into textual semantics for multimodal named entity recognition and multimodal relation extraction. By utilizing the information bottleneck principle, refinement-regularizer, and variational information bottleneck (VIB) model, the proposed method achieves excellent performance on multiple datasets."
