    "translated_abstract": "StepMix是一个用于广义有限混合模型(潜在剖面和潜在类分析)与外部变量(协变量和远程结果)的伪似然估计(单步、两步和三步方法)的开源软件包。在许多社会科学的应用中，主要目标不仅是将个体聚类成潜在类别，还包括使用这些类别来开发更复杂的统计模型。这些模型通常分为一个将潜在类别与观察指标相关联的测量模型和一个将协变量和结果变量与潜在类别相关联的结构模型。测量和结构模型可以使用所谓的一步法共同估计，也可以使用逐步方法逐步估计，对于从业人员来说，这些方法在估计潜在类别的可解释性方面具有显著优势。除了一步法，StepMix还实现了文献中提出的最重要的逐步估计方法，提供了用户友好的界面，方便模型的估计、选择和解释。",
