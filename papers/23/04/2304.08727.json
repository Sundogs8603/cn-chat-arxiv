    "abstract": "Service-providing firms compete for clients, creating market structures ranging from domination by a few giant companies to markets in which there are many small firms.

We seek the simplest realistic model giving rise to such diverse market structures and dynamics. We focus on markets in which every client adopts a single firm, and can, from time to time, switch to a different firm. The markets of cell phone and Internet service providers are examples. In the model, the size of a particular firm, labelled i, is equal to its current number of clients, ni. In every step of the simulation, a client is chosen at random, and then selects a firm from among the full set of firms with probability pi = (beta + ni^alpha)/K, where K is the normalization factor. Our model thus has two parameters: alpha represents the deg",

    "translated_abstract": "服务提供企业之间通过竞争来获取客户，创造了从少数巨头公司到许多小型公司的市场结构。这些市场结构会随时间演变，并在许多年后保持稳定，然后经历新公司出现并快速获得大市场份额的干扰。本文旨在寻找最简单的真实模型，以产生这种多样的市场结构和动态。我们重点关注的是每个客户只采用一个公司的市场，并可以不时地转向另一个公司，例如手机和互联网服务提供商市场。在该模型中，被标记为i的特定企业的规模等于其当前客户数量ni。在模拟的每一步中，随机选择一个客户，然后以pi =（beta + ni ^ alpha）/ K的概率从整个公司集合中选择一个公司，其中K是正则化因子。因此，我们的模型具有两个参数：alpha代表退化",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种简单的模型，用于模拟服务提供企业市场结构的演变，其关注点在于每个客户只采用一个公司的市场，以及市场中存在出现和快速获得大市场份额的新公司的干扰。该模型简单易懂，只有两个参数。",

The model is easy to understand and only has two parameters."
