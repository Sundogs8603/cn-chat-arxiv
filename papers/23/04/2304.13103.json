    "translated_abstract": "随着区块链技术的快速发展，智能合约已成为金融、医疗保健、保险和游戏等许多行业中的常用工具。智能合约数量已经成倍增加，同时由于智能合约漏洞带来的经济损失，智能合约的安全性引起了相当大的关注。现有的分析技术能够识别大量的智能合约安全漏洞，但它们过于依赖专家建立的刚性标准，检测过程随着智能合约的复杂程度增加而变得更加耗时。在本文中，我们提出了 HyMo 作为一种多模态混合深度学习模型，它智能地考虑多种输入表示来实现多模态，并使用 FastText 词嵌入技术将每个单词表示为字符的 n-gram，与由两个 GRUs 组成的序列处理模型的 BiGRU 深度学习技术搭配，以实现智能合约漏洞检测的最佳结果。",
