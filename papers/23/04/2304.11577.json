    "abstract": "We investigate a linear quadratic stochastic zero-sum game where two players lobby a political representative to invest in a wind turbine farm. Players are time-inconsistent because they discount performance with a non-constant rate. Our objective is to identify a consistent planning equilibrium in which the players are aware of their inconsistency and cannot commit to a lobbying policy. We analyze the equilibrium behavior in both single-player and two-player cases and compare the behavior of the game under constant and non-constant discount rates. The equilibrium behavior is provided in closed-loop form, either analytically or via numerical approximation. Our numerical analysis of the equilibrium reveals that strategic behavior leads to more intense lobbying without resulting in overshooting.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一个线性二次随机零和博弈，两个玩家游说政治代表投资于风力涡轮机场项目。玩家由于折扣率的非常数性而存在时不一致性。我们的目标是识别一种一致的规划均衡，使得玩家意识到自己的不一致性并且不能承诺一项游说策略。我们分析了单个玩家和双玩家情况下的均衡行为，并比较了在固定和非固定折扣率下的游戏行为。均衡行为以闭环形式提供，可以通过解析方法或数值逼近得到。我们对均衡的数值分析表明，策略行为导致更强烈的游说而不会导致越界现象。",
