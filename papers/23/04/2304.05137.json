    "abstract": "Spider webs are incredible biological structures, comprising thin but strong silk filament and arranged into complex hierarchical architectures with striking mechanical properties (e.g., lightweight but high strength, achieving diverse mechanical responses). While simple 2D orb webs can easily be mimicked, the modeling and synthesis of 3D-based web structures remain challenging, partly due to the rich set of design features. Here we provide a detailed analysis of the heterogenous graph structures of spider webs, and use deep learning as a way to model and then synthesize artificial, bio-inspired 3D web structures. The generative AI models are conditioned based on key geometric parameters (including average edge length, number of nodes, average node degree, and others). To identify graph construction principles, we use inductive representation sampling of large experimentally determined spider web graphs, to yield a dataset that is used to train three conditional generative models: 1) A",

    "translated_abstract": "蜘蛛网是非常不可思议的生物结构，由薄但强韧的蚕丝组成，并排列成复杂的分层结构，具有惊人的力学性能（例如轻量但高强度，实现各种力学响应）。简单的2D网形状很容易被模仿，但建模和合成基于三维网状结构的网是具有挑战性的，部分原因是由于设计特征的丰富性。在本文中，我们提供了关于蜘蛛网异质性图结构的详细分析，并使用深度学习对人工合成的生物启发式三维网状结构进行建模。生成式AI模型是基于主要几何参数进行约束（包括平均边长度，节点数，平均节点度等等）。为了识别图构建原则，我们使用归纳表示采样的大型实验确定的蜘蛛网图形数据集，从而训练出三个有条件的生成模型：1) A",
