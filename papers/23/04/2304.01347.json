    "translated_abstract": "有证据表明，动态功能连接可以捕捉静息态功能磁共振成像数据中的脑活动时变异常，并在揭示精神分裂症（SZ）患者异常脑活动机制方面具有天然优势。因此，本文采用了一种先进的动态脑网络分析模型——时态脑类别图卷积网络（temporal-BCGCN）。首先设计了独特的动态脑网络分析模块DSF-BrainNet，用于构建动态同步特征。随后，提出了一种革命性的图卷积方法TemporalConv，基于特征的同步时间属性。最后，提出了一种基于静息态功能磁共振成像数据的深度学习模块化异常半球侧化检测工具，称为CategoryPool。该研究在COBRE和UCLA数据集上进行验证，分别达到83.62％和89.71％的平均准确率，优于基线模型和其他最先进模型，在精神分裂症诊断和侧化分析方面表现出色。",
