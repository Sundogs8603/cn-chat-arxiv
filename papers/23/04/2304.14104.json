    "translated_abstract": "人际互动是多样且依赖于上下文的，但先前的工作将它们视为分类，忽略了可能的互动的重尾。本文提出了一种新的学习人际互动的范式，将其作为自由文本从单一的静态图像中学习，从而允许对情况和人际关系的无限空间进行灵活建模。为了克服缺乏特定于此任务的标记数据的问题，我们使用知识蒸馏应用于由大型语言模型产生的合成字幕数据，以此生成伪标签。我们展示了通过这个过程产生的伪标签可以用于训练一种字幕模型，能有效理解图像中的人际互动，通过衡量我们预测的文本和语义质量与事实的基础性的各种指标来衡量。我们进一步展示了我们的方法在这个任务上的性能优于SOTA的图像字幕和情境识别模型。我们将公开我们的代码。",
