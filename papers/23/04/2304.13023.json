    "abstract": "Photos serve as a way for humans to record what they experience in their daily lives, and they are often regarded as trustworthy sources of information. However, there is a growing concern that the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology may produce fake photos, which can create confusion and diminish trust in photographs. This study aims to answer the question of whether the current state-of-the-art AI-based visual content generation models can consistently deceive human eyes and convey false information. By conducting a high-quality quantitative study with fifty participants, we reveal, for the first time, that humans cannot distinguish between real photos and AI-created fake photos to a significant degree 38.7%. Our study also finds that an individual's background, such as their gender, age, and experience with AI-generated content (AIGC), does not significantly affect their ability to distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs. However, we do observe that ",

    "translated_abstract": "照片是人们记录日常生活经历的一种方式，通常被认为是可信的信息来源。然而，越来越多的人担心人工智能（AI）技术的进步可能产生伪造的照片，从而产生困惑并降低对照片的信任。本研究旨在回答一个问题，即当前最先进的基于AI的视觉内容生成模型能否持续地欺骗人类的眼睛，并传达错误信息。通过对50名参与者进行高质量的定量研究，我们首次揭示，人类无法显著区分真实照片和AI创建的伪造照片，达到38.7%。我们的研究还发现，个人的背景，如性别，年龄和经验，对区分AI生成的图像和真实照片的能力没有显著影响。但是，我们观察到",
