    "abstract": "Failure to recognize samples from the classes unseen during training is a major limit of artificial intelligence (AI) in real-world implementation of retinal anomaly classification. To resolve this obstacle, we propose an uncertainty-inspired open-set (UIOS) model which was trained with fundus images of 9 common retinal conditions. Besides the probability of each category, UIOS also calculates an uncertainty score to express its confidence. Our UIOS model with thresholding strategy achieved an F1 score of 99.55%, 97.01% and 91.91% for the internal testing set, external testing set and non-typical testing set, respectively, compared to the F1 score of 92.20%, 80.69% and 64.74% by the standard AI model. Furthermore, UIOS correctly predicted high uncertainty scores, which prompted the need for a manual check, in the datasets of rare retinal diseases, low-quality fundus images, and non-fundus images. This work provides a robust method for real-world screening of retinal anomalies.",

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能在实际视网膜异常分类应用中的一个主要限制是无法识别训练过程中未见过的类别样本。为解决这一障碍，我们提出了一种基于不确定性的开放集(UIOS)模型，该模型使用了9个常见视网膜病变的眼底图像进行训练。除了每个类别的概率，UIOS还计算了不确定性得分来表达其置信度。我们的UIOS模型通过设置阈值策略，在内部测试数据集、外部测试数据集和非典型测试数据集中的F1分别达到了99.55％、97.01％和91.91％，相比标准人工智能模型的F1分别为92.20％、80.69％和64.74％。此外，UIOS正确预测了罕见视网膜疾病、低质量眼底图像和非眼底图像等数据集中的高不确定性分数，提示需要手动检查。这项工作为真实世界的视网膜异常筛查提供了一个强大的方法。",
