    "translated_abstract": "编排高质量的数据准备程序对于成功的机器学习（ML）至关重要，但众所周知，这是耗时费力的。尽管像ChatGPT这样的大型语言模型在通过自然语言提示与用户交互生成程序方面具有令人印象深刻的能力，但仍存在限制。具体而言，用户必须提供特定的提示来引导ChatGPT迭代地改进数据准备程序，这需要对编程、使用的数据集和ML任务有一定的专业知识。此外，一旦生成了程序，在不重新开始整个过程的情况下回顾先前的版本或对程序进行更改是很困难的。在本文中，我们提出了ChatPipe，这是一个新颖的系统，旨在促进用户和ChatGPT之间的无缝交互。 ChatPipe为用户提供关于下一个数据准备操作的有效建议，并指导ChatGPT生成操作的程序。另外，Chatpipe使用户能够轻松修改生成的程序或切换到先前的版本。我们对三个真实的数据集进行了实验，结果表明，ChatPipe可以显著减少为ML任务准备数据所需的时间和精力。",
