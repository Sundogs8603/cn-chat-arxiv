    "translated_abstract": "MANET是一组通过无线网络通信的移动节点，它们从一个点移动到另一个点。由于MANET是一个没有基础设施且拓扑结构可变的网络，因此很容易受到攻击。恶意网络节点是网络攻击的源头。在MANET中，攻击可以采取各种形式，并以其独特的方式改变网络的运行。本文介绍了许多形式的攻击、它们对MANET的影响以及目前实施的MANET防御措施。所提出的采用区块链技术的安全路由算法（SRABC）可保护MANET免受攻击并对节点进行认证。该算法通过提供源节点到目的节点的安全、经过认证和防篡改的路由来保护控制和数据流，防范威胁。使用NS2模拟器评估了SRABC算法的关键性能参数，如数据包传递率、端到端延迟和吞吐量。仿真结果表明，SRABC算法优于当前方法，是确保MANET安全的可行选项。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a secure routing algorithm (SRABC) using blockchain technology to protect MANETs from various attacks, authenticate nodes and provide a secure, authenticated and tamper-proof route from the source node to the destination node to safeguard data and control flow. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms current methods and is a feasible option for ensuring security in MANETs."
