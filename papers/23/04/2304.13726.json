    "translated_abstract": "物联网应用现在需要具备识别和自适应等功能。虽然物联网节点的功耗是这些应用的主要关注点，但由于无线网络上连续传输传感器或图像数据，基于云的处理变得不可持续。因此，应在物联网节点中集成优化的机器学习能力和数据传输。此外，物联网应用通常需要进行间歇性数据记录和能耗高的数据处理（例如图像分类）。因此，节点的多功能性在解决处理和能源的广泛需求方面非常关键。本文介绍了SamurAI，这是一种多功能的物联网节点，通过利用两个芯片内子系统来弥合处理和能量方面的差距：一个低功率、无时钟、事件驱动的Always-Responsive (AR) 部分和一个高效的On-Demand (OD) 部分。 AR包含一个1.7MOPS事件驱动的异步 Wake-up 控制器（WuC），207ns唤醒时间的优化适用于间歇性操作。",
