    "translated_abstract": "提高多领域性能是一个具有挑战性的任务，通常需要大量的数据来训练和测试模型。主动学习技术通过使模型选择最具信息量的样本进行标记，从而减少了实现高性能所需的标记数据量，提供了一个有希望的解决方案。本文提出了一个基于主动学习的框架，用于改进多个领域的性能。我们的方法分为两个阶段：首先，我们使用一组初始标记数据来训练基础模型，然后我们迭代地选择最具信息量的样本进行标记，以改进模型。我们在多个数据集上评估了我们的方法，包括图像分类、情感分析和物体识别。我们的实验表明，我们的方法始终优于基准方法，并在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。我们还表明，我们的方法高效，只需要很小的标记数据量就能取得更好的性能。",
