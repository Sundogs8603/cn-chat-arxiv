    "translated_abstract": "本文针对带协变信息的随机规划，提出了一种嵌入非凸分段仿射决策规则(PADR)的经验风险最小化(ERM)方法，旨在学习特征与最优决策之间的直接映射。我们建立了基于PADR的ERM模型的非渐近一致性结果，可用于无约束问题，以及约束问题的渐近一致性结果。为了解决非凸和非可微的ERM问题，我们开发了一个增强的随机主导下降算法，并建立了沿（复合强）方向稳定性的渐近收敛以及复杂性分析。我们表明，所提出的PADR-based ERM方法适用于广泛的非凸型SP问题，并具有理论一致性保证和计算可处理性。数值研究表明，在各种设置下，PADR-based ERM方法相对于最先进的方法具有优越的性能。",
