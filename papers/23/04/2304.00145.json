    "translated_abstract": "生物标记分割中的解剖一致性对于许多医学图像分析任务至关重要。将像素连通性，即数字拓扑中的基本概念，纳入深度网络以建模像素间的关系是实现解剖一致分割的有前途的模式。然而，以前的连通性模型工作忽略了潜在空间中丰富的通道方向信息。在本研究中，我们证明了从共享潜在空间中有效地分离出方向子空间，可以显著增强基于连通性的网络中的特征表示。为此，我们提出了一种方向连接建模方案，用于分割，可以在整个网络中解耦、跟踪和利用方向信息。对各种公共医学图像分割基准的实验证明了我们的模型相对于现有最先进方法的有效性。代码可在https://github.com/Zyun-Y/Dconn获取。",
