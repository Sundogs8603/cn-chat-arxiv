    "translated_abstract": "我们最近的深入研究发现，经过训练后的物理信息神经网络（PINN）往往是局部逼近器。这一观察结果引发了这种新型的物理信息径向基网络（PIRBN），它可以在整个训练过程中保持局部特性。与深度神经网络相比，PIRBN只包含一个隐藏层和一个径向基“激活”函数。在适当的条件下，我们证明了使用梯度下降法训练PIRBN可以收敛到高斯过程。此外，我们通过神经切线核（NTK）理论研究了PIRBN的训练动力学。此外，我们还对PIRBN的初始化策略进行了全面调查。基于数值例子，PIRBN已被证明比PINN在解决具有高频特征和不适定计算域的PDE方程方面更有效和高效。此外，现有的PINN数字技术，例如ad...",
