    "translated_abstract": "最近，有多项研究提出了量子联邦学习（QFL）的框架。例如，谷歌TensorFlow Quantum（TFQ）和TensorFlow Federated（TFF）库已经被用于实现QFL。然而，开发者大多不熟悉量子计算（QC）库和框架。提供一个为QC和联邦学习（FL）库提供抽象层的领域特定建模语言（DSML）是有益的。这可以使从业人员在部署量子机器学习（QML）最新技术的同时高效地进行软件开发和数据科学任务。在这篇立场论文中，我们提出扩展现有的面向机器学习（ML）启用系统的领域特定模型驱动工程（MDE）工具（如MontiAnna、ML-Quadrat和GreyCat）以支持QFL。",
