    "abstract": "With the launch of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) are shaking up our whole society, rapidly altering the way we think, create and live. For instance, the GPT integration in Bing has altered our approach to online searching. While nascent LLMs have many advantages, new legal and ethical risks are also emerging, stemming in particular from stochastic parrots and hallucination. The EU is the first and foremost jurisdiction that has focused on the regulation of AI models. However, the risks posed by the new LLMs are likely to be underestimated by the emerging EU regulatory paradigm. Therefore, this correspondence warns that the European AI regulatory paradigm must evolve further to mitigate such risks.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着ChatGPT的推出，大语言模型（LLMs）正在动摇我们整个社会，快速改变我们的思维、创造和生活方式。然而，随着随机鹦鹉和幻觉等新的法律和伦理风险出现，新兴LLMs也带来了许多挑战。欧盟是第一个将重点放在AI模型监管上的司法管辖区。然而，新LLMs带来的风险可能会被新兴的欧盟监管范式所低估。因此，本函告警示欧洲AI监管范式必须进一步发展以减轻这些风险。",
