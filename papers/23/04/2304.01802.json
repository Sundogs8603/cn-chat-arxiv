    "translated_abstract": "我们提出使用机器学习技术找到等几何分析（IGA）中构造刚度和质量矩阵的最佳求积规则。我们最初考虑跨越统一和非统一节点序列的任意次1D样条空间，然后使用张量积意义下生成的最佳规则进行高维空间的积分。 求积规则搜索被提出为一个优化问题，并通过基于梯度下降的机器学习策略来解决。然而，由于优化空间高度非凸，搜索的成功强烈依赖于求积点数和参数初始化。因此，我们使用一种动态规划策略，该策略使用具有较少节点的样条空间上的最优解来初始化参数。使用该方法，我们发现了在使用高达50个均匀元素和多项式度数高达8的IGA离散化时，样条空间的最佳求积规则。生成的求积规则是稳健高效的，并且在许多基准问题中表现出比Gauss型求积规则和标准中点规则更好的性能。",
