    "abstract": "This survey article provides insights regarding the future of affirmative action by analyzing the implementation methods and the empirical evidence on the use of placement quotas in the Brazilian higher education system. All federal universities have required income and racial-based quotas in Brazil since 2012. Affirmative action in federal universities is uniformly applied across the country, which makes evaluating its effects particularly valuable. Affirmative action improves the outcomes of targeted students. Specifically, race-based quotas raise the share of black students in federal universities, an effect not observed with income-based quotas alone. Affirmative action has downstream positive consequences for labor market outcomes. The results suggest that income and race-based quotas beneficiaries experience substantial long-term welfare benefits. There is no evidence of mismatching or negative consequences for targeted students' peers.",

    "translated_abstract": "该文章通过分析巴西高等教育系统中实现方法和实证证据的使用情况，提供了有关平衡配额制未来的深入见解。自2012年以来，巴西所有联邦大学都要求收入和种族配额。在巴西，联邦大学的平衡配额制度是全国统一的，这使其效果评估尤其有价值。平衡配额制改善了目标学生的成果。具体而言，基于种族的配额制提高了在联邦大学就读的黑人学生比例，这种效果无法仅通过基于收入的平衡配额实现。平衡配额制对劳动力市场产生正面影响，并为效益受益者带来了长期福利。没有证据表明对目标学生的同龄人有误匹配或负面后果。",
