In this study, a two-stage feature extraction framework using eight state-of-the-art pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and an autoencoder is proposed to determine the health conditions of patients (COVID-19, Normal, Viral Pneumonia) based on chest X-rays. The X-ray scans are divided into four equally sized sections and analyzed by deep pre-trained CNNs. Subsequently, an autoencoder with three hidden layers is trained to extract reproductive features from the concatenated ouput of CNNs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, three different classifiers, which are single-layer perceptron (SLP), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM) are used. Furthermore, the deep CNN architectures are used to create benchmark models and trained on the same dataset for comparision. The proposed framework outperforms other",
