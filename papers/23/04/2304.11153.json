    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于进化策略的算法ES-Single，用于估计展开的计算图中的梯度。与最近提出的持久进化策略（PES）类似，ES-Single是无偏的，并通过平滑元损失函数来克服由于递归函数应用而产生的混沌。ES-Single对于每个粒子采样一个单一扰动，并在内部问题的过程中保持不变（例如，对于每个部分未展开，不会重新采样扰动）。与PES相比，ES-Single实现更简单，方差更低：ES-Single的方差与截断展开次数的数量无关，消除了使用短截断来解决长内部问题所带来的关键障碍。我们展示了ES-Single对于二次内部问题是无偏的，并且通过实验证明了它的方差可以显著地低于PES。ES-Single在多项任务中持续优于PES，包括合成基准测试。",
