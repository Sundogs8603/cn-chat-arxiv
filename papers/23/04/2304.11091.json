    "translated_abstract": "非直视传播条件是影响超宽带室内定位系统(IPC)定位精度的关键因素。已经应用了许多受监督的机器学习(ML)方法来进行NLoS识别，以提高IPC的准确性。然而，当数据库包含少量NLoS信号和大量视线直达(LoS)信号时，现有的ML方法难以保持较高的分类精度。这些少量的NLoS信号导致目标节点的定位不准确，这仍然是一个问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了基于特征的GD和GGD NLoS检测算法。通过采用我们的检测算法对不平衡的数据集进行分类，可以实现96.7%和98.0%的分类精度。我们还将所提出的算法与现有的支持向量机(SVM)、随机森林(RF)和k近邻(k-NN)算法在相同的数据集上进行了比较。所提出的算法在分类精度和效率方面均优于现有算法。",
