    "translated_abstract": "随着数据隐私问题的日益严重，分布式数据的中央化训练变得不可行，需要协作学习框架。为了解决这个问题，出现了两种主要的框架：联邦学习（FL）和分割学习（SL）。虽然FL已经建立了各种基准框架和研究库，但SL目前尚缺乏统一的库，尤其是在标签共享、模型聚合和切割层选择方面的多样性。这种标准化缺乏使得比较SL范式变得困难。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了SLPerf，这是一个统一的共享学习研究框架和开放式研究库，并在四个广泛使用的数据集上进行了大量实验，这些数据集涵盖了IID和非IID数据的情况。我们的贡献包括对最近提出的SL范式的全面调查，不同SL范式在不同情况下进行详细的基准比较，以及用于改进SL范式的丰富工程带走信息和研究见解。",
