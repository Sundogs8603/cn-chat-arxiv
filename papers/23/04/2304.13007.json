    "translated_abstract": "现代多跳问题解答（QA）系统通常将问题分解为一系列思考步骤（CoT），然后才得出最终答案。通常来说，多个链条被抽样并通过最终答案的投票机制进行聚合，但中间步骤本身被丢弃。虽然这种方法提高了性能，但它们并不考虑链之间的中间步骤之间的关系，并且不提供预测答案的统一解释。我们引入了基于元推理的 Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR) 方法，该方法利用大型语言模型来超越多个思考链，而不是聚合回答。MCR检查不同的推理链，混合它们之间的信息并选择在生成解释和预测答案时最相关的事实。MCR在7个多跳QA数据集上胜过强基线。此外，我们的分析表明MCR的解释具有高质量。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a meta-reasoning approach, Multi-Chain Reasoning (MCR), that goes beyond multiple chains of thought by examining different reasoning chains, mixing information between them, and selecting the most relevant facts for answering multi-hop QA problems. Experimental results show that MCR outperforms several strong baselines, and MCR explanations exhibit high quality."
