    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种称为稀疏标注（SA）的新标注方法，用于人群计数，通过对图像中个体进行稀疏标注来减少人工标注工作。我们认为稀疏标注可以减少完全标注的冗余，并从未被完全捕捉的远处个体中捕获更多多样化的信息，而这是部分标注方法无法达到的。此外，我们提出了一个基于点的渐进点匹配网络（PPM），以更好地从整个图像中探索稀疏标注的人群，其中包括提议匹配网络（PMN）和性能恢复网络（PRN）。PMN使用基本的点分类器生成伪点样本，而PRN则使用伪点对点分类器进行细化以最大化性能。我们的实验结果表明，在相同数量的注释下，PPM比先前的半监督人群计数方法表现更好，并且获得了与最先进的全监督方法相竞争的性能。",
