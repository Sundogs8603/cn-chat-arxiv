    "translated_abstract": "深度学习在医学图像分割方面的应用可以显著支持医生的诊断。深度学习需要大量的训练数据，因此需要数据增强来扩展多样性以防止过拟合。然而，现有的医学图像分割数据增强方法主要基于需要更新参数和消耗额外计算资源的模型。我们提出了一种旨在训练高精度深度学习网络进行医学图像分割的数据增强方法。所提出的数据增强方法被称为KeepMask和KeepMix，可以通过更好地识别器官边界来创建医学图像，而不需要额外的参数。我们的方法在数据集上实现了更好的性能，并获得了更精确的医学图像分割边界。在CHAOS上，我们的方法的Dice系数达到了94.15％（比基线高3.04％），在MSD脾脏上达到了74.70％（比基线高5.25％）。",
