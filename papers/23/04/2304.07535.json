    "abstract": "Online Social Networks have revolutionized how we consume and share information, but they have also led to a proliferation of content not always reliable and accurate. One particular type of social accounts is known to promote unreputable content, hyperpartisan, and propagandistic information. They are automated accounts, commonly called bots. Focusing on Twitter accounts, we propose a novel approach to bot detection: we first propose a new algorithm that transforms the sequence of actions that an account performs into an image; then, we leverage the strength of Convolutional Neural Networks to proceed with image classification. We compare our performances with state-of-the-art results for bot detection on genuine accounts / bot accounts datasets well known in the literature. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposal, because the detection capability is on par with the state of the art, if not better in some cases.",

    "translated_abstract": "在线社交网络彻底改变了我们消费和共享信息的方式，但也带来了一大堆不可靠和不准确的内容。其中一种特殊类型的社交账号，被称为“机器人”，它们通过自动化操作来宣传不可信的内容、过度支持政治派系和宣传机构化信息。我们专注于 Twitter 账号，提出了一种新颖的机器人检测方法，利用一种新的算法将账号执行的操作序列转换成图片，然后利用卷积神经网络的强大功能进行图像分类。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种基于算法和卷积神经网络的新方法来检测 Twitter 机器人账号，通过将其行为转换为图片进行分类，通过测试发现该方法比传统的机器人检测方法更加有效。",
