In this paper, we extend the method to partial differential equations. The resulting model is comprised of up to three neural networks, modelling terms representing conservation, dissipation and external forces, and discrete convolution operators that can either be learned or be prior knowledge. We demonstrate numerically the superior performance of PHNN compared to a baseline model that models the full dynamics by a single neural network. Moreover, since the PHNN model consists of three parts with different physical interpretations, these can be studied separately to gain insight into the system, and the learned model is applicable also if external forces are removed or changed.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近提出了伪哈密顿神经网络(PHNN)来学习可以用普通微分方程建模的动力系统。本文将该方法扩展到了偏微分方程。所得模型由高达三个神经网络，模拟代表守恒、耗散和外力的项以及可以学习或为先前知识的离散卷积算子构成。我们通过数值结果表明PHNN相比单个神经网络建模的基线模型具有更优越的性能。此外，由于PHNN模型由三个具有不同物理解释的部分组成，可以分别研究这些部分以获得对系统的洞察，并且即使去除或改变外力，所学得的模型仍然适用。",
