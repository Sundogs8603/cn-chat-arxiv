    "abstract": "In fetal ultrasound screening, Doppler images on the umbilical artery (UA) are important for monitoring blood supply through the umbilical cord. However, to capture UA Doppler images, a number of steps need to be done correctly: placing the gate at a proper location in the ultrasound image to obtain blood flow waveforms, and judging the Doppler waveform quality. Both of these rely on the operator's experience. The shortage of experienced sonographers thus creates a demand for machine assistance. We propose an automatic system to fill this gap. Using a modified Faster R-CNN we obtain an algorithm that suggests Doppler flow gate locations. We subsequently assess the Doppler waveform quality. We validate the proposed system on 657 scans from a national ultrasound screening database. The experimental results demonstrate that our system is useful in guiding operators for UA Doppler image capture and quality assessment.",

    "translated_abstract": "在胎儿超声筛查中，通过脐带进行监测的脐动脉多普勒图像对于监测胎儿的血液供应非常重要。然而，为了捕捉脐动脉多普勒图像，需要正确地执行多个步骤：在超声图像中放置门，以获取血流波形，并判断多普勒波形质量。这些步骤都依赖于操作者的经验。经验不足的超声医生的短缺因此产生了机器辅助的需求。我们提出了一个自动系统来填补这个缺口。使用改进的 Faster R-CNN 方法，我们得到了一个算法，它建议多普勒流门的位置。我们随后评估多普勒波形质量。我们在国家超声筛查数据库上对所提出的系统进行了验证，涵盖了657个扫描结果。实验结果表明，我们的系统在指导操作者捕捉脐动脉多普勒图像和评估图像质量方面是有用的。",
