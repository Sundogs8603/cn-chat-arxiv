    "translated_abstract": "经济中的总体借贷规模和条款取决于财富如何在对未来持有不同信仰的潜在债权人中分配。如果贷款得到全额偿还，则不确定性逐渐解决，使乐观主义者更加被青睐。反之，如果出现大规模违约，则悲观主义者更被看好。我们在一个拥有两种资产——风险债券和无风险现金的经济体中建模这个过程。在每个时期内，考虑到相继经历的信仰类型，借贷的规模和条款都是内生确定的。好的状态之后，总借贷和债务面额都会上升，利率会下降。在没有噪声的情况下，财富会收敛到与实际概率不同的信仰，风险厌恶越大，乐观主义越强。在存在噪声的情况下，经济体表现出高表现期和低表现期的交替。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper models how the distribution of wealth and beliefs among creditors can impact borrowing and lending in an economy, affecting interest rates and levels of debt. The results show that the economy cycles between high and low performance periods, and that even in the absence of noise, individuals' beliefs can diverge from actual probabilities, with greater risk aversion associated with greater optimism."
