    "translated_abstract": "现代机器人技术往往涉及多个共享环境中运作的实体智能体。这些情况下的路径规划比单个机器人的情况更加具有挑战性。虽然标准的抽样算法（SBAs）可以用于在机器人关节空间中搜索解决方案，请注意当机器人数目增加时，此方法很快会变得计算上的问题。为了解决这个问题，我们将因子分解的概念集成到抽样算法中，这只需要最少的对现有方法进行修改。在搜索解决方案期间，我们可以使用因子分解启发式来将不同的代理子集解耦合（即因子分解）成独立的低维搜索空间，一旦我们证明它们未来的解决方案不会互相依赖。因此，我们逐步构建一个紧凑的超图，其中某些（超）边将代理分割为独立的子图。在最好的情况下，这种方法可以减少 d 增长。",
