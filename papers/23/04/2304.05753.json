    "translated_abstract": "人脸防伪（FAS）是保护自动人脸识别系统完整性的重要机制。尽管有了重大进展，但将现有方法推广到实际应用仍然具有挑战性。这种限制可以归因于公开可用的FAS数据集的稀缺性和缺乏多样性，这经常导致训练期间过拟合或测试期间饱和。就数量而言，欺诈主体的数量是一个重要的决定因素。大多数数据集仅包括少于2,000个受试者。就多样性而言，大多数数据集由在受控环境中使用重复机械化过程收集的欺诈样本组成。这种数据收集方法导致同质化样本和场景多样性的匮乏。为了解决这些缺点，我们介绍了野外人脸防伪（WFAS）数据集，这是一个大规模的、多样化的FAS数据集，可在不受限制的情况下收集。",
    "tldr": "前人的人脸防伪（FAS）技术应用于实际场景仍然存在限制，因为当前公开的FAS数据集数量和多样性不足，引起过拟合和场景误判。通过引入野外人脸防伪（WFAS）数据集，该研究提高了数据规模和多样化程度，促进了FAS技术的发展。",
    "en_tdlr": "The existing limitations in applying face anti-spoofing (FAS) technology to practical scenarios are partially attributed to the scarcity and lack of diversity in publicly available datasets, inducing overfitting and scenario misjudgment. Introducing the Wild Face Anti-Spoofing (WFAS) dataset, this research boosts the data scale and diversity and consequently advances FAS technology."
