    "abstract": "Multi-document summarization is challenging because the summaries should not only describe the most important information from all documents but also provide a coherent interpretation of the documents. This paper proposes a method for multi-document summarization based on cluster similarity. In the extractive method we use hybrid model based on a modified version of the PageRank algorithm and a text correlation considerations mechanism. After generating summaries by selecting the most important sentences from each cluster, we apply BARTpho and ViT5 to construct the abstractive models. Both extractive and abstractive approaches were considered in this study. The proposed method achieves competitive results in VLSP 2022 competition.",

    "translated_abstract": "多文档摘要很具有挑战性，因为摘要不仅应描述所有文档中最重要的信息，还应提供文档的连贯解释。本文提出了一种基于聚类相似性的多文档摘要方法。在提取式方法中，我们使用基于修改后的PageRank算法和文本关联考虑机制的混合模型。通过从每个簇中选择最重要的句子生成摘要后，我们应用了BARTpho和ViT5来构建抽象模型。本研究考虑了提取式和抽象式方法。所提出的方法在VLSP 2022竞赛中取得了竞争性的结果。",
