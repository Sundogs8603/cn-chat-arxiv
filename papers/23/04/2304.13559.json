    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose Multi-Modal Databases (MMDBs), which is a new class of database systems that can seamlessly query text and tables using SQL. To enable seamless querying of textual data using SQL in an MMDB, we propose to extend relational databases with so-called multi-modal operators (MMOps) which are based on the advances of recent large language models such as GPT-3. The main idea of MMOps is that they allow text collections to be treated as tables without the need to manually transform the data. As we show in our evaluation, our MMDB prototype can not only outperform state-of-the-art approaches such as text-to-table in terms of accuracy and performance but it also requires significantly less training data to fine-tune the model for an unseen text collection.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新型数据库系统，即多模态数据库（MMDBs），它可以使用SQL语言无缝地查询文本和表格数据。为了实现在MMDB中使用SQL语言进行文本数据的无缝查询，我们提出了所谓的多模态运算符（MMOps），它们基于最近大型语言模型（例如GPT-3）的进展。MMOps的主要思想是，它们允许将文本集合作为表格进行处理，而无需手动转换数据。正如我们在评估中展示的那样，我们的MMDB原型不仅在准确性和性能方面优于最先进的方法（如文本转表），而且在对一个未见过的文本集合进行模型微调时，需要的训练数据数量也显著减少。",
