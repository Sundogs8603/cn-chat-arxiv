    "abstract": "We used survival analysis to quantify the impact of postdischarge evaluation and management (E/M) services in preventing hospital readmission or death. Our approach avoids a specific pitfall of applying machine learning to this problem, which is an inflated estimate of the effect of interventions, due to survivors bias -- where the magnitude of inflation may be conditional on heterogeneous confounders in the population. This bias arises simply because in order to receive an intervention after discharge, a person must not have been readmitted in the intervening period. After deriving an expression for this phantom effect, we controlled for this and other biases within an inherently interpretable Bayesian survival framework. We identified case management services as being the most impactful for reducing readmissions overall, particularly for patients discharged to long term care facilities, with high resource utilization in the quarter preceding admission.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们采用生存分析来量化出院后评估和管理服务在防止住院或死亡方面的影响。我们的方法避免了应用机器学习到这个问题上的一个特定陷阱，那就是因为幸存者偏差而导致的效果过高 -- 这种过高的估计可能与人群中的异质性混淆因素有关。这种偏差之所以产生，是因为为了在出院后接受干预，一个人必须在介入期内没有再次住院。在得出这种幻影效应的表达式后，我们在本质上可解释的贝叶斯生存框架中控制了这个和其他偏差。我们确定个案管理服务对于整体减少再住院具有最大的影响力，特别是对于出院后到长期护理机构的患者，在入院前一个季度有高资源利用率的患者。",
