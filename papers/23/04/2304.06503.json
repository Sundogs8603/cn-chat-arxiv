    "translated_abstract": "随着提出覆盖整个AI系统复杂性的AI法案，欧盟提供了第一个适用于整个AI系统的监管文件。一些人担心该法规留给解释的空间过大，因此对社会的利益帮助不大，而其他人则认为该法规太过严格，因此阻碍了进步和创新，以及妨碍了欧盟内公司的经济成功。在没有系统方法的情况下，很难评估它将如何影响AI领域。本文提出了一种系统方法，我们在2021年4月发布的AI法案初始草案上应用了该方法。我们与计算机科学和法律领域的专家一起，通过对德国列出的AI产品和项目进行分类，归类了这些产品和项目的AI法案。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了欧盟提出的AI法案对AI系统的影响，通过对德国的AI产品和项目进行分类，得出了该法案的具体要求和限制，为评估该法案在AI领域的实际影响提供了系统方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a systematic approach for evaluating the impact of the AI Act proposed by the European Union on the AI landscape. The authors classified AI products and projects in Germany according to the AI Act's requirements and restrictions, providing a framework for assessing the real-world effects of the regulation."
