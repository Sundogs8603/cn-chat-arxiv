    "abstract": "Missing data are an unavoidable complication in many machine learning tasks. When data are `missing at random' there exist a range of tools and techniques to deal with the issue. However, as machine learning studies become more ambitious, and seek to learn from ever-larger volumes of heterogeneous data, an increasingly encountered problem arises in which missing values exhibit an association or structure, either explicitly or implicitly. Such `structured missingness' raises a range of challenges that have not yet been systematically addressed, and presents a fundamental hindrance to machine learning at scale. Here, we outline the current literature and propose a set of grand challenges in learning from data with structured missingness.",

    "translated_abstract": "缺失数据是许多机器学习任务中不可避免的复杂问题。当数据是“随机缺失”时，存在一系列的工具和技术来解决此问题。然而，随着机器学习研究变得更加雄心勃勃，并且试图从越来越大量的异构数据中学习，越来越普遍的问题是出现了缺失值的关联或结构，无论是明确还是隐含。这种“结构性缺失”提出了一系列尚未系统解决的挑战，并对规模化的机器学习构成了重要阻碍。在这里，我们概述了当前的文献，并提出了一组关于如何在带有结构性缺失的数据中学习的挑战。",
