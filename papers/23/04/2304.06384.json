    "translated_abstract": "Sepsis是由于宿主无法抵御感染而引起的危及生命的器官功能障碍，如果不进行适当和及时的治疗，会导致死亡。因此，在高危人群中及时诊断和治疗感染性休克对提供患者快速治疗至关重要。研究表明，将感染性休克检测提前6小时可以提高抗生素的早期使用率，从而改善病死率。然而，诸如序贯器官衰竭评分（SOFA）之类的临床评分不适用于早期预测，而机器学习算法可以帮助捕捉早期预测的发展模式。因此，我们旨在开发一种机器学习算法，可以在临床怀疑感染性休克之前6小时预测其发生。尽管已经将一些机器学习算法应用于感染性休克预测，但其中许多算法并没有考虑到6小时并不是一个小的时间窗口。在本文中，我们提出了一种多子集方法，将具有不同特征子集的多个机器学习模型集成起来，从而可以早期预测ICU患者感染性休克的发生。",
