    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT的发布揭示了语言模型可以取代人类智慧的各种可能性。本文旨在了解ChatGPT是否有潜力在社交计算任务中复制人类生成的标签注释。这样的成就可以显著降低社交计算研究的成本和复杂性。因此，我们使用ChatGPT重新标记了五个具有里程碑意义的数据集，涉及立场检测（2个）、情感分析、仇恨言论和机器人检测。我们的结果表明，ChatGPT有潜力处理这些数据注释任务，尽管仍存在许多挑战。ChatGPT获得了平均精度0.609。 ChatGPT对情感分析数据集的表现最佳，正确注释了64.9％的推文。然而，我们显示性能在不同标签之间有很大差异。我们认为这项工作可以开辟新的分析线路，并作为未来利用ChatGPT进行数据注释的基础。",
