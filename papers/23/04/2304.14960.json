    "abstract": "Great socio-economic transitions see the demise of certain industries and the rise of others. The losers of the transition tend to deploy a variety of tactics to obstruct change. We develop a political-economy model of interest group competition and garner evidence of tactics deployed in the global climate movement. From this we deduce a set of strategies for how the climate movement competes against entrenched hydrocarbon interests. Five strategies for overcoming obstructionism emerge: (1) Appeasement, which involves compensating the losers; (2) Co-optation, which seeks to instigate change by working with incumbents; (3) Institutionalism, which involves changes to public institutions to support decarbonization; (4) Antagonism, which creates reputational or litigation costs to inaction; and (5) Countervailance, which makes low-carbon alternatives more competitive. We argue that each strategy addresses the problem of obstructionism through a different lens, reflecting a diversity of act",

    "translated_abstract": "伴随着大型社会经济转型，某些行业的衰落和其他行业的崛起是不可避免的。输掉这场转型的一方往往会采取各种策略来阻挠变革。我们提出了一个政治经济模型来分析利益集团的竞争，并验证了在全球气候运动中采用的策略。我们归纳出克服阻挠主义的五种策略：（1）安抚，即对输家进行补偿；（2）共同发起变革，与现有企业合作实现变革；（3）制度主义，通过改变公共机构来支持脱碳；（4）对抗，即通过声誉或诉讼成本来制衡不作为；（5）抵消，即使低碳替代品更具竞争力。我们认为每种策略从不同的角度解决了阻挠问题，反映了多样化的行动。",
