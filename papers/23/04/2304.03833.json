    "translated_abstract": "学习演示的方法可以通过教师演示达到特定的目的，但是当教师用于演示的行为空间与学生不同时，就会出现行为空间不匹配的问题。本文提出了一种框架，即模仿学习中的形态适应（MAIL），旨在帮助学生代理根据其他形态显着不同的代理的演示进行训练。 MAIL可以从次优演示中学习，只要这些演示提供了一些指引，以达到预期的解决方案。作者在具有挑战性的家庭布料操作任务上演示了MAIL，并介绍了一个新的DRY CLOTH任务 - 在三维空间中带有障碍物的布料操作任务。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a framework, Morphological Adaptation in Imitation Learning (MAIL), that solves the problem of action space mismatch in learning from demonstrations by allowing training from demonstrations by agents with significantly different morphologies, even from suboptimal demonstrations. The demonstration is shown in challenging household cloth manipulation tasks and a new cloth manipulation task in 3D with obstacles."
