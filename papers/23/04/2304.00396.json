    "abstract": "Serverless cloud is an innovative cloud service model that frees customers from most cloud management duties. It also offers the same advantages as other cloud models but at much lower costs. As a result, the serverless cloud has been increasingly employed in high-impact areas such as system security, banking, and health care. A big threat to the serverless cloud's performance is cold-start, which is when the time of provisioning the needed cloud resource to serve customers' requests incurs unacceptable costs to the service providers and/or the customers. This paper proposes a novel low-coupling, high-cohesion ensemble policy that addresses the cold-start problem at infrastructure- and function-levels of the serverless cloud stack, while the state of the art policies have a more narrowed focus. This ensemble policy anchors on the prediction of function instance arrivals, 10 to 15 minutes into the future. It is achievable by using the temporal convolutional network (TCN) deep-learning m",

    "translated_abstract": "无服务器云是一种创新的云服务模型，可以使客户免除大部分云管理职责。它还提供了与其他云模型相同的优势，但成本要低得多。因此，无服务器云已经越来越多地应用于系统安全、银行和医疗保健等高影响领域。无服务器云性能面临的一个重大威胁是冷启动，当为了为客户请求提供所需的云资源的时间造成的成本对于服务提供商和/或客户来说是不可接受的。本文提出了一个新的低耦合、高内聚的集合策略，可以在无服务器云栈的基础结构和功能层面上解决冷启动问题，而现有技术的策略则更加狭窄。",
