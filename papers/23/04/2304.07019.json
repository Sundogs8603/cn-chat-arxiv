    "abstract": "Lithium is a critical material for the energy transition, but conventional procurement methods have significant environmental impacts. In this study, we utilize regional energy system optimizations to investigate the techno-economic potential of the low-carbon alternative of direct lithium extraction in deep geothermal plants. We show that geothermal plants will become cost-competitive in conjunction with lithium extraction, even under unfavorable conditions and partially displace photovoltaics, wind power, and storage from energy systems. Our analysis indicates that if 10% of municipalities in the Upper Rhine Graben area in Germany constructed deep geothermal plants, they could provide enough lithium to produce about 1.2 million electric vehicle battery packs per year, equivalent to 70% of today`s annual electric vehicle registrations in the European Union. This approach could offer significant environmental benefits and has high potential for mass application also in other countries,",

    "translated_abstract": "锂是能源转型的关键材料，但传统的采购方法具有重大环境影响。本研究利用区域能源系统优化，调查了直接从深部地热厂中提取锂的低碳替代方法的技术经济潜力。我们展示了地热发电厂与锂提取相结合将具备成本竞争力，即使在不利条件下，也将部分取代光伏、风能和储能系统。我们的分析表明，如果德国上莱茵沟谷地区10%的城市建造深部地热发电厂，他们可以提供足够的锂，以生产大约每年1.2百万个电动汽车电池组，相当于欧洲联盟今天年电动车注册量的70%。这种方法可以带来显著的环境效益，并有在其他国家大规模应用的高潜力",
