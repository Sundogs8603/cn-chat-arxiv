    "translated_abstract": "数据是机器学习和因果推断任务的核心组成部分。来自开放数据存储库、数据湖和数据市场等来源的大量数据的可用性提供了增强数据和提高这些任务性能的机会。然而，增强技术依赖于用户手动发现和筛选有用的候选增强项。现有解决方案未利用发现和增强之间的协同作用，因此未充分利用数据。在本文中，我们介绍METAM，一种新颖的目标导向框架，该框架通过向下游任务查询候选数据集，形成一个反馈循环，自动引导发现和增强过程。为了高效地选择候选项，METAM利用数据属性、效用函数和解集大小的特性。我们展示了METAM的理论保证，并在广泛的任务集上进行了实证演示。总的来说，我们展示了目标导向数据发现在提高机器学习和因果推断任务性能方面的前景。",
