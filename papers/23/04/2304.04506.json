    "abstract": "This paper provides a micro-economic foundation for argument that direct employment by government is more desirable than government purchase of private goods to eliminate unemployment. A general equilibrium model with monopolistic competition is devised, and effects of policy parameters (government purchase, government employment, and tax rate) to macroeconomic variables (consumption, price, and profit) are investigated. It is shown that 1) the government purchase is inflationary in the sense that additional effective demand by government not only increases private employment but also raises prices; 2) the government employment can achieve full employment without causing a rise in prices.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个微观经济基础，支持政府直接雇用比政府购买私人商品更有利于消除失业。通过一种具有垄断竞争性质的一般均衡模型，研究了政策参数（政府购买、政府雇佣和税率）对宏观经济变量（消费、价格和利润）的影响。研究表明：1）政府购买具有通胀性质，因为政府的额外有效需求不仅增加了私人就业，还提高了价格；2）政府雇佣可以实现充分就业，而不会引起价格上涨。",
