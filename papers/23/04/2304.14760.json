    "abstract": "Two types of explanations have received significant attention in the literature recently when analyzing the decisions made by classifiers. The first type explains why a decision was made and is known as a sufficient reason for the decision, also an abductive or PI-explanation. The second type explains why some other decision was not made and is known as a necessary reason for the decision, also a contrastive or counterfactual explanation. These explanations were defined for classifiers with binary, discrete and, in some cases, continuous features. We show that these explanations can be significantly improved in the presence of non-binary features, leading to a new class of explanations that relay more information about decisions and the underlying classifiers. Necessary and sufficient reasons were also shown to be the prime implicates and implicants of the complete reason for a decision, which can be obtained using a quantification operator. We show that our improved notions of necessa",

    "translated_abstract": "近来，当分析分类器决策时，已经有两种类型的解释受到了文献中的重视。第一种解释是为决策提供充分理由的解释，即缩写为PI解释的诱导式解释；第二种解释是为何不做出其他决策的解释，即对照式或反事实解释的必要理由。这些解释是为二元、离散和在某些情况下为连续特征的分类器定义的。我们展示了当存在非二元特征时，这些解释可以得到显著的改进，从而导致了一类新的解释方法，可以提供更多关于决策和基础分类器的信息。必要和充分原因也被证明是完整原因的主要蕴含项和被蕴含项，可以使用量化算子获得。我们的结果表明，我们改进的必要和充分原因的概念比现有方法更好地适用于具有非二元特征的分类器。",
