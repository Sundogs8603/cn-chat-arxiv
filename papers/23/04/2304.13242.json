    "translated_abstract": "人类通过遵守相互知晓的导航模式在遵循规则的环境下进行合作导航，这些模式可以表示为方向路径或道路车道。从不完全观测到的环境中推断出这些导航模式是智能移动机器人在未映射位置操作所必需的。然而，算法定义这些导航模式是非常困难的。本文提出了第一个仅从局部观测中学习推断真实环境中导航模式的自监督学习（SSL）方法。我们解释了如何使用几何数据增强，预测世界建模和信息论正则化器实现了在无限数据情况下预测无偏本地方向软车道概率（DSLP）场。我们演示了如何通过将最大似然图拟合到DSLP场中来推断全局导航模式。实验证明，在模拟和移动机器人的真实世界实验中，我们的自监督模型在从局部观测中学习预测导航模式的任务中胜过了两个SOTA有监督模型。",
