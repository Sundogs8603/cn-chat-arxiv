    "abstract": "We provide an exact expressions for the 1-Wasserstein distance between independent location-scale distributions. The expressions are represented using location and scale parameters and special functions such as the standard Gaussian CDF or the Gamma function. Specifically, we find that the 1-Wasserstein distance between independent univariate location-scale distributions is equivalent to the mean of a folded distribution within the same family whose underlying location and scale are equal to the difference of the locations and scales of the original distributions. A new linear upper bound on the 1-Wasserstein distance is presented and the asymptotic bounds of the 1-Wasserstein distance are detailed in the Gaussian case. The effect of differential privacy using the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms on the 1-Wasserstein distance is studied using the closed-form expressions and bounds.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提供了独立于位置-比例分布的1-Wasserstein距离的准确计算公式。 这些公式是用位置和比例参数以及特殊函数(如标准高斯分布或伽马函数)表示的。 特别是，我们发现独立于位置-比例分布的一维1-矩量距离等于同一族中折叠分布的均值，其基础位置和比例等于原始分布的位置和比例之差。 我们提供了一个新的线性上界和高斯情况下的渐近界限。 我们利用这些闭合的公式和界限来研究拉普拉斯和高斯机制对1-Wasserstein距离的影响。",
