    "abstract": "The beekeeping sector has undergone considerable production variations over the past years due to adverse weather conditions, occurring more frequently as climate change progresses. These phenomena can be high-impact and cause the environment to be unfavorable to the bees' activity. We disentangle the honey production drivers with tree-based methods and predict honey production variations for hives in Italy, one of the largest honey producers in Europe. The database covers hundreds of beehive data from 2019-2022 gathered with advanced precision beekeeping techniques. We train and interpret the machine learning models making them prescriptive other than just predictive. Superior predictive performances of tree-based methods compared to standard linear techniques allow for better protection of bees' activity and assess potential losses for beekeepers for risk management.",

    "translated_abstract": "蜜蜂养殖业在过去几年中经历了可观的生产变化，这是由于逐渐恶化的气候条件造成的。这些现象可能会对蜜蜂活动不利。我们使用树模型方法区分蜜蜂生产量的影响因素，并预测意大利蜂箱的蜜蜂生产量变化，意大利是欧洲最大的蜂蜜生产国之一。该数据库包含了从2019年到2022年收集的数百个蜂箱的数据，采用了先进的精度蜜蜂养殖技术。我们训练和解释机器学习模型，使其具有指导性而不仅仅是预测性。与标准线性技术相比，树模型方法具有更高的预测性能，可以更好地保护蜜蜂活动并评估风险管理中蜜蜂养殖者的潜在损失。",
