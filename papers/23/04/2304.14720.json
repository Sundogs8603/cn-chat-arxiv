    "translated_abstract": "下一代Wi-Fi网络正在引入新功能，如多链路操作（MLO），以实现更高的吞吐量和更低的延迟。然而，由于可用信道数量有限，一组竞争基本服务集（BSS）的多个链路的使用可能会导致更高的干扰和信道争用，从而可能导致性能和可靠性降低。在这种情况下，如果所有竞争的BSS都使用更少的链路以减少信道访问争用，则可能更好。最近，强化学习（RL）已经证明其在无线网络资源分配优化方面的潜力。然而，每个无线网络的独立运行使得每个单独网络学习一个好的配置变得困难 - 如果不是几乎不可能的话。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了使用联合机器学习方法--联邦强化学习（FRL）框架的方法。",
