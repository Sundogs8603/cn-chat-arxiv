We develop a method for detecting effects based on copula theory, high dimensional distribution distances, and permutational statistics to analyze a designed experiment synthesizing plutonium oxide from Pu(III) Oxalate. We detect effects of strike order and oxalic acid feed on the microstructure of the resulting plutonium oxide, which match the literature well. We also detect excess bivariate effects between the pairs of acid concentration, strike order and precipitation temperature.",
