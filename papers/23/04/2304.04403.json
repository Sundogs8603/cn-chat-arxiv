    "translated_abstract": "随着对于自动驾驶和遥感等有向物体检测需求的日益增长，有向注释变得非常费力。为了充分利用现有的水平注释数据集并降低注释成本，已经提出了一种弱监督检测器H2RBox，用于从水平框Box中学习旋转框RBox，并受到了广泛关注。本文介绍了H2RBox-v2的新版本，以进一步弥合HBox监督和RBox监督的有向物体检测之间的差距。通过我们的理论分析，利用翻转和旋转一致性来开发轴对称性是可行的，H2RBox-v2则采用与H2RBox类似的弱监督分支，并嵌入一个新颖的自监督分支，它可以从对象图像中固有的对称性中学习方向。通过处理周边问题的模块（例如角周期性），实现了一种稳定而有效的解决方案。据我们所知，H2RBox-v2是第一个将对称学习应用于基于HBox监督的有向物体检测，并在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。",
