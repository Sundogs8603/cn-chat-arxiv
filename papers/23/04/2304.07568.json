    "abstract": "In this paper, the interaction of geopolitical actors in the production and sale of military equipment is studied. In section 2 the production of military equipment is considered as the two person zero-sum game. In such game, the strategies of the players are defined by the information state of the actors. The optimal strategy of geopolitical actors is found. In section 3, the conflict process is considered, the optimal strategy is determined for each geopolitical actor.",
