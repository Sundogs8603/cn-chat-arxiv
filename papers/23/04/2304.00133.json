    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习（ML）模型的复杂性增加以及不同（和关键）领域中的应用增加，越来越需要更易解释和可信赖的ML。解释复杂ML模型的一种简单且与模型无关的方法是训练代理模型（例如规则集和决策树），以足够接近原始模型，但更简单和易于解释。然而，规则集可以变得非常冗长，包含许多if-else语句，而决策树的深度会随着准确模拟复杂ML模型而迅速增加。在这种情况下，两种方法都可能无法实现其核心目标，提供用户模型的可解释性。我们通过提出DeforestVis解决了这个问题，这是一种可视化分析工具，通过提供使用自适应增强（AdaBoost）技术生成的代理决策树（一级决策树），为用户提供了对复杂ML模型行为的友好总结。我们的解决方案帮助用户探索模型的复杂性。",
