    "translated_abstract": "探测策略已被证明可以检测大型语言模型中各种语言特征的存在；特别是作为自然语言推理任务（NLI）的“自然逻辑”片段的中间语义特征。在自然逻辑中，中间特征与蕴含标签之间的关系是明确知晓的：因此，这为对NLI模型表示进行干预研究提供了成熟的设置，从而能够提供更强的因果假说和对干预探测方法进行更深入的批判性分析。在这项工作中，我们进行新的和现有的表示级干预，以研究这些语义特征对NLI分类的影响：我们执行了健忘探测（根据学习的线性探测器删除特征），并引入了遗忘-记忆探测变体（除了探测器选择的特征外，遗忘所有维度）。此外，我们深入探讨了这些方法的局限性，并概述了一些可能的改进方向。",
    "tldr": "本文利用表示级干预进行了自然语言推理任务中中间语义特征对分类结果的影响研究，包括健忘探测及遗忘-记忆探测变体，为之后的干预探测提供了重要指导意义。",
