    "abstract": "Objective: Identifying study-eligible patients within clinical databases is a critical step in clinical research. However, accurate query design typically requires extensive technical and biomedical expertise. We sought to create a system capable of generating data model-agnostic queries while also providing novel logical reasoning capabilities for complex clinical trial eligibility criteria.  Materials and Methods: The task of query creation from eligibility criteria requires solving several text-processing problems, including named entity recognition and relation extraction, sequence-to-sequence transformation, normalization, and reasoning. We incorporated hybrid deep learning and rule-based modules for these, as well as a knowledge base of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and linked ontologies. To enable data-model agnostic query creation, we introduce a novel method for tagging database schema elements using UMLS concepts. To evaluate our system, called LeafAI, we compare",

    "translated_abstract": "目的：在临床研究中，确定研究资格的患者是关键步骤。然而，准确的查询设计通常需要广泛的技术和生物医学专业知识。我们试图创建一个系统，能够生成数据模型不受限制的查询，同时为复杂的临床试验资格标准提供新颖的逻辑推理能力。材料和方法：从资格标准创建查询的任务需要解决几个文本处理问题，包括命名实体识别和关系提取、序列到序列转换、归一化和推理。我们结合了深度学习和基于规则的模块以及统一医学语言系统（UMLS）和链接本体，建立了一个知识库。为了实现数据模型不受限制的查询创建，我们介绍了一种使用UMLS概念标记数据库模式元素的新方法。为了评估我们的系统LeafAI，我们与两个具有临床应用背景的真实世界数据库进行了比较。",
