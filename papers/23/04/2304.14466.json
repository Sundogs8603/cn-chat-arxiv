    "translated_abstract": "无人机图像中的车辆检测和识别是一个复杂的问题，已用于不同的安全目的。这些图像的主要挑战是以斜角度捕获，并带来了许多挑战，如不均匀的照明效果，退化，模糊，遮挡，能见度丧失等。此外，天气条件对导致安全问题起着至关重要的作用，并向收集的数据添加了另一个高级别的挑战。过去几十年间，采用了各种技术来检测和跟踪不同天气条件下的车辆。然而，在大雪天气下检测车辆仍处于初级阶段，因为缺乏可用数据。此外，没有任何研究使用无人机实际捕捉到的图像来检测雪天气中的车辆。本研究旨在通过提供捕捉在不同设置和各种雪覆盖条件下的车辆数据来填补这一空白，以服务于科学社区。",
