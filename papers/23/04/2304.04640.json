    "translated_abstract": "神经形态计算领域在遵循仿生学原理的基础上，具有推进计算效率和能力的巨大潜力。然而，神经形态研究中采用的技术多样性导致缺乏清晰的基准测试标准，阻碍了对神经形态方法与传统基于深度学习的方法的优劣势进行有效评估。本文提出了一个协作项目——NeuroBench，将学术界和工业界成员聚集起来为神经形态计算定义基准测试。NeuroBench的目标是成为社区开发的协作、公平和代表性的基准测试套件。本文讨论了基准测试神经形态解决方案面临的挑战，并概述了NeuroBench的关键特性。我们相信，NeuroBench将是定义能够统一神经形态计算目标的标准的重要一步。",
