    "translated_abstract": "将高级语义相关内容和低级解剖特征集成到医学图像分割中非常重要。近期基于深度学习的医学分割方法在更好地建模这些信息方面取得了很大的成功。然而，医学分割的卷积操作通常在规则网格上运行，这在高频区域即边界区域中天生模糊。本文提出了一个名为MORSE的通用隐式神经渲染框架，旨在在解剖层面上为医学图像分割辅助学习。我们的方法基于事实：相较于离散的基于网格的表示方式，隐式神经表示在拟合复杂信号和解决计算机图形问题时表现更为有效。我们的方法的核心是以端到端的方式将医学图像分割视为渲染问题。具体而言，我们持续地对齐粗略的分割p并利用随机专家来生成渲染图像。",
