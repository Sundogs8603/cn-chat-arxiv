    "translated_abstract": "数字孪生（DT）利用虚拟世界的表示，以及通信（例如6G）、计算（例如边缘计算）和人工智能（AI）技术，实现了许多连接的智能服务。为了处理基于数字孪生（DT）的大量网络数据，无线系统可以利用语义通信（SC）范例，通过利用AI技术（如因果推断）促进知情决策来处理严格的通信限制。本文提出了一种名为因果语义通信（CSC）的新框架，用于基于数字孪生的无线系统。CSC系统被提出作为模仿学习（IL）问题，其中发射器通过使用DT访问最优网络控制策略来教授接收器如何在带宽有限的无线通道上使用SC来提高其知识以执行最优控制操作。源数据中的因果结构使用新技术提取出来，使得教学框架更加通用且具有解释性。",
