    "abstract": "While quality estimation (QE) can play an important role in the translation process, its effectiveness relies on the availability and quality of training data. For QE in particular, high-quality labeled data is often lacking due to the high-cost and effort associated with labeling such data. Aside from the data scarcity challenge, QE models should also be generalizable, i.e., they should be able to handle data from different domains, both generic and specific. To alleviate these two main issues -- data scarcity and domain mismatch -- this paper combines domain adaptation and data augmentation within a robust QE system. Our method is to first train a generic QE model and then fine-tune it on a specific domain while retaining generic knowledge. Our results show a significant improvement for all the language pairs investigated, better cross-lingual inference, and a superior performance in zero-shot learning scenarios as compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "质量评估对翻译流程至关重要，但其有效性取决于训练数据的可用性和质量。对于特定的质量评估而言，由于标记这样的数据的成本和工作量高昂，因此高质量的标记数据经常缺乏。除了数据缺乏方面的挑战外，质量评估模型还应具有泛化性，即它们应该能够处理来自不同领域的数据，包括通用领域和特定领域数据。因此，本文将领域自适应和数据增强进行了结合，提出了一种强大的质量评估系统。方法是先训练一个通用质量评估模型，然后在保留通用知识的同时对特定领域进行微调。研究结果表明，在所有研究的语言对中，我们的方法均取得了显着的改进，并具有更好的跨语言推断，相比于最先进的基线在零-shot学习方案中具有更高的性能。",
