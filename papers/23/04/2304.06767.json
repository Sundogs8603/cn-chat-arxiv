    "translated_abstract": "生成型基础模型容易受到广泛的无监督训练数据带来的隐式偏见的影响。这些偏见可能导致子优样本、扭曲的结果和不公平，可能产生重大影响。因此，将这些模型与人的伦理和偏好对齐是确保它们在真实应用中负责任和有效的部署的关键步骤。以往的研究主要采用人类反馈的强化学习（ RLHF）作为解决这个问题的手段。在 RL 算法的指导下，用人类反馈指导的奖励模型对生成模型进行微调。然而， RL 算法的低效性和不稳定性常常会对生成模型的成功对齐产生重大障碍，因此需要开发一种更为强大和简化的方法。为此，我们引入了一个新的框架，即奖励排名微调（ RAFT ），旨在对齐生成基础模型。",
