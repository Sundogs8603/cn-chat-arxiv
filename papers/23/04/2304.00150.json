    "abstract": "We contribute to the vastly growing field of machine learning for engineering systems by demonstrating that equivariant graph neural networks have the potential to learn more accurate dynamic-interaction models than their non-equivariant counterparts. We benchmark two well-studied fluid flow systems, namely the 3D decaying Taylor-Green vortex and the 3D reverse Poiseuille flow, and compare equivariant graph neural networks to their non-equivariant counterparts on different performance measures, such as kinetic energy or Sinkhorn distance. Such measures are typically used in engineering to validate numerical solvers. Our main findings are that while being rather slow to train and evaluate, equivariant models learn more physically accurate interactions. This indicates opportunities for future work towards coarse-grained models for turbulent flows, and generalization across system dynamics and parameters.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过展示同变图神经网络相对于非同变网络有更高学习动态交互模型的潜力，为机器学习工程系统领域做出了贡献。我们对两种传统的流体流动系统进行基准测试，即三维衰减的Taylor-Green涡旋和三维反Poiseuille流，并在不同性能度量（如动能或Sinkhorn距离）上将同变图神经网络与非同变网络进行比较。这些度量通常用于验证数值求解器，在训练和评估速度缓慢的情况下，我们主要发现同变模型可以学习到更加物理准确的交互。这表明了未来研究在粗粒度模型上对湍流流动的研究机会，以及在系统动态和参数上的推广。",
