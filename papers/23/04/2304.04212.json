    "abstract": "This paper presents RISC, an open-source Python package data generator (https://github.com/GRAAL-Research/risc). RISC generates look-alike automobile insurance contracts based on the Quebec regulatory insurance form in French and English. Insurance contracts are 90 to 100 pages long and use complex legal and insurance-specific vocabulary for a layperson. Hence, they are a much more complex class of documents than those in traditional NLP corpora. Therefore, we introduce RISCBAC, a Realistic Insurance Synthetic Bilingual Automobile Contract dataset based on the mandatory Quebec car insurance contract. The dataset comprises 10,000 French and English unannotated insurance contracts. RISCBAC enables NLP research for unsupervised automatic summarisation, question answering, text simplification, machine translation and more. Moreover, it can be further automatically annotated as a dataset for supervised tasks such as NER",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文介绍了一个名为RISC的Python开源包数据生成器，它可以生成类似于魁北克省法规保险格式的汽车保险合同，包括法语和英语版本。保险合同通常长达90到100页，使用专业的法律和保险术语，因此比传统的NLP语料库中的文档类别更为复杂。因此，我们介绍了基于魁北克省强制汽车保险合同的逼真保险合成双语汽车合同数据集RISCBAC。该数据集包括10,000份未经标注的法语和英语保险合同。RISCBAC可用于NLP研究中的无监督自动摘要、问答、文本简化、机器翻译等任务。此外，它还可以进一步自动标注为监督任务的数据集，例如命名实体识别。",
