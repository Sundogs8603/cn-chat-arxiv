    "translated_abstract": "事件数据指的是从文本中自动提取的结构化记录，描述“谁对谁做了什么”，是国际政治学者的重要数据来源。由于开发新的事件数据集的高成本，特别是使用依赖手工构建字典的自动化系统，大多数研究人员使用大型预先存在的数据集，例如ICEWS，而不是开发针对其特定研究问题进行了优化的定制事件数据集。本文介绍了一些诀窍，利用自然语言处理（NLP）的最新进展，实现高效的定制事件数据生产。本文介绍了一些技术，如使用主动学习来训练事件类别分类器，在文本中使用大型语言模型和标准机器学习分类器来识别行动者和动作的接收者，以及使用NLP的预训练“问答”模型来解决提及的问题。",
