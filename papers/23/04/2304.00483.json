High-quality datasets are needed for general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) training, as well as for domain-specific models, which are usually small in size as it is costly to engage a large number of domain experts for their creation.

    "translated_abstract": "数据的质量低可能会导致高风险应用程序中的问题。数据中心方法强调提高数据集质量以增强模型性能。高质量的数据集对通用大语言模型（LLM）训练以及领域特定模型都是必需的，由于吸引大量领域专家参与创建数据集会很昂贵，因此领域特定训练数据的高质量对于模型性能是至关重要的。本文提出了一种增强原始数据集数据质量的框架，将该框架应用于四个生物医学数据集，通过使用回译来提高原始数据集的质量，在BioASQ数据集上对检索/读者模型进行微调时，我们的方法提高了最多33％/40％的性能。",
