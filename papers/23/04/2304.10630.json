    "abstract": "We introduce an algorithm, Cayley transform ellipsoid fitting (CTEF), that uses the Cayley transform to fit ellipsoids to noisy data in any dimension. Unlike many ellipsoid fitting methods, CTEF is ellipsoid specific -- meaning it always returns elliptic solutions -- and can fit arbitrary ellipsoids. It also outperforms other fitting methods when data are not uniformly distributed over the surface of an ellipsoid. Inspired by calls for interpretable and reproducible methods in machine learning, we apply CTEF to dimension reduction, data visualization, and clustering. Since CTEF captures global curvature, it is able to extract nonlinear features in data that other methods fail to identify. This is illustrated in the context of dimension reduction on human cell cycle data, and in the context of clustering on classical toy examples. In the latter case, CTEF outperforms 10 popular clustering algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种算法，Cayley变换椭球拟合(CTEF)，它使用Cayley变换在任意维度上将椭球拟合到嘈杂的数据中。与许多椭球拟合方法不同，CTEF是椭球特定的——意味着它总是返回椭圆解——并且可以拟合任意的椭球。当数据不均匀地分布在椭球表面上时，它也优于其他拟合方法。受机器学习中可解释和可重复方法的呼吁启发，我们将CTEF应用于降维、数据可视化和聚类。由于CTEF捕捉全局曲率，因此它能够提取其他方法无法识别的数据中的非线性特征。这在人类细胞周期数据的降维和在经典玩具例子的聚类的背景下得到了说明。在后一种情况下，CTEF优于10种流行的聚类算法。",
