These methods have been applied in computer vision, natural language processing, environmental sound analysis, and recently in music information retrieval, e.g. for pitch estimation. Particularly in the context of music, there are few insights about the fragility of these models regarding different distributions of data, and how they could be mitigated. In this paper, we explore these questions by dissecting a self-supervised model for pitch estimation adapted for tempo estimation via rigorous experimentation with synthetic data. Specifically, we study the relationship between the input representation and data distribution for self-supervised tempo estimation.",

    "translated_abstract": "自监督方法通过解决不需要人工标注的先决任务来学习表示方法，减轻了需要耗费时间的标注工作。这些方法已被应用于计算机视觉、自然语言处理、环境声音分析，最近还用于音乐信息检索，例如音高估计。尤其是在音乐领域，这些模型在不同数据分布下的脆弱性以及如何缓解这些问题方面的见解还很少。在本文中，我们通过对合成数据进行严格的实验，剖析了一种自监督音高估计模型并将其应用于节奏估计，探讨了输入表示和数据分布与自监督节奏估计之间的关系。",
