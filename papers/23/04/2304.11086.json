    "translated_abstract": "ICICLE智能环境计算学习人工智能研究所的目标是通过建立下一代网络基础设施，使人工智能更具普适性并推动其在更大范围内的民主化。本研究描述了我们开发的Jupyter Notebooks和Python命令行客户端，这些客户端使用ICICLE身份验证机制访问ICICLE资源和服务。我们使用支持科学家访问、利用和管理多院校资源和服务的Tapis框架来连接客户端。我们使用Neo4j将数据组织成一个知识图谱（KG）。然后，我们将KG托管在Tapis Pod上，Tapis Pod提供一个特别为Neo4j KG而制作的模板进行持久数据存储。为了演示我们软件的功能，我们开发了几个客户端：Jupyter笔记本身份验证、使用ICICLE资源进行神经网络训练，以及用于访问ICICLE服务的命令行界面。我们的工作证明了使用Tapis和Neo4j开发访问网络基础设施服务的认证客户端的可行性。",
