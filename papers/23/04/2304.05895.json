We support our examination with testing on three image and five tabular datasets. Our research indicates that DA, when applied to imbalanced data, produces substantial changes in model weights, support vectors and feature selection; even though it may only yield relatively modest changes to global metrics, such as balanced accuracy or F1 measure.
