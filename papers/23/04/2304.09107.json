    "abstract": "In this paper, we study multiple problems from sponsored product optimization in ad system, including position-based de-biasing, click-conversion multi-task learning, and calibration on predicted click-through-rate (pCTR). We propose a practical machine learning framework that provides the solutions to such problems without structural change to existing machine learning models, thus can be combined with most machine learning models including shallow models (e.g. gradient boosting decision trees, support vector machines). In this paper, we first propose data and feature engineering techniques to handle the aforementioned problems in ad system; after that, we evaluate the benefit of our practical framework on real-world data sets from our traffic logs from online shopping site. We show that our proposed practical framework with data and feature engineering can also handle the perennial problems in ad systems and bring increments to multiple evaluation metrics.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了赞助产品优化中的多个问题，包括基于位置的去偏差、点击-转化多任务学习以及预测点击率的校准。我们提出了一个实用的机器学习框架，可以解决这些问题，而不需要改变现有机器学习模型的结构，因此可以与大多数机器学习模型结合使用（包括浅层模型，如梯度提升决策树、支持向量机）。在本文中，我们首先提出了数据和特征工程技术，以处理广告系统中的上述问题; 然后，我们评估了我们的实用框架在来自在线购物网站流量日志的实际数据集上的效益。我们表明，我们的提议的实用框架与数据和特征工程也可以处理广告系统中的长期问题，并为多个评估指标带来增量。",
