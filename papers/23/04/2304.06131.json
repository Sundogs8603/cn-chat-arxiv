    "translated_abstract": "虽然深度学习模型已成为医学图像分割的主要方法，但它们通常无法推广到涉及新解剖学、图像模式或标签的未见分割任务。针对新的分割任务，研究人员通常必须训练或微调模型，这是耗时的，并且对于临床研究人员来说构成了实质性的障碍，他们往往缺乏训练神经网络所需的资源和经验。我们提出了一种称为UniverSeg的方法，用于解决未见的医学分割任务，无需额外的训练。给定一个查询图像和一组定义新分割任务的图像-标签对示例集，UniverSeg使用新的交叉块机制生成准确的分割地图，无需额外的训练。为了实现对新任务的推广，我们收集并标准化了53个开放医学分割数据集，包含超过22,000个扫描图像，我们称之为MegaMedical。",
