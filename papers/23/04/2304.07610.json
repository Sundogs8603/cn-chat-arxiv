    "en_tdlr": "This tutorial paper provides an introduction to the application of Bayesian statistical inversion (BSI) in inverse problems. The advantages of BSI over traditional methods include quantifying uncertainty by assigning a probability to each possible value of the unknown parameter/input and incorporating prior information and beliefs about the parameter/input. The tutorial uses illustrative examples of heat transfer to explain the capabilities and important steps of implementing BSI."
