    "abstract": "Although portfolio diversification is the typical strategy followed by risk-averse investors, extreme portfolios that allocate all funds to a single asset/state of the world are common too. Such asset-demand behavior is compatible with risk-averse subjective expected utility maximization under beliefs that assign a strictly positive probability to every state. We show that whenever finitely many extreme asset demands are rationalizable in this way under such beliefs, they are simultaneously rationalizable under the same beliefs by: (i) constant absolute risk aversion; decreasing absolute risk aversion/increasing relative risk aversion (DARA/IRRA); risk-neutral; and ris-kseeking utility indices at all wealth levels; (ii) a distinct class of DARA/IRRA utility indices at some strictly positive fixed initial wealth; and (iii) decreasing relative risk aversion utility indices under bounded wealth. We also show that, in such situations, the observable data allow for sharp bounds to be given ",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然投资组合多样化是风险厌恶的投资者通常采用的策略，但为了单一资产/世界状态分配所有资金的极端投资组合也很常见。这种资产需求行为与风险厌恶的主观期望效用最大化相容，假设将每个状态分配一个严格正的概率。我们表明，只要有限个极端资产需求在此种信念下是合理化的，它们就可以同时在同样信念下通过：(i)绝对风险厌恶的常数；递减的绝对风险厌恶/递增的相对风险厌恶(DARA/IRRA)；风险中性；所有财富水平下的追求风险的效用指数；(ii)于某个严格正的固定初期财富水平下明显不同的DARA/IRRA效用指数类；和(iii)在有界财富下递减的相对风险厌恶效用指数。我们还表明，在这种情况下，可观察数据允许给出尖锐的限制。",

When finitely many extreme asset demands are rationalizable under these beliefs, they can be rationalized simultaneously through certain utility indices."
