    "abstract": "In recent years, precision agriculture has gradually oriented farming closer to automation processes to support all the activities related to field management. Service robotics plays a predominant role in this evolution by deploying autonomous agents that can navigate fields while performing tasks without human intervention, such as monitoring, spraying, and harvesting. To execute these precise actions, mobile robots need a real-time perception system that understands their surroundings and identifies their targets in the wild. Generalizing to new crops and environmental conditions is critical for practical applications, as labeled samples are rarely available. In this paper, we investigate the problem of crop segmentation and propose a novel approach to enhance domain generalization using knowledge distillation. In the proposed framework, we transfer knowledge from an ensemble of models individually trained on source domains to a student model that can adapt to unseen target domains. ",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，精确农业逐渐朝着自动化的方向发展，以支持与田间管理相关的所有活动。服务机器人在这一演变中发挥重要作用，通过部署能够在田间导航并在无需人为干预的情况下执行任务的自主代理，例如监测、喷洒和收获。为了执行这些精确的动作，移动机器人需要一个实时感知系统，能够理解周围环境并在野外识别目标。对于实际应用来说，对新的作物和环境条件进行泛化是至关重要的，因为很少有标记样本可用。在本文中，我们研究了作物分割问题，并提出了一种使用知识蒸馏增强域泛化的新方法。在所提出的框架中，我们将来自源域上单独训练的模型集合的知识传递给一个可以适应未见目标域的学生模型。",
