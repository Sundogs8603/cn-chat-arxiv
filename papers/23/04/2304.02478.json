We explored 23 Hong Kong secondary school students' attempts to write stories comprising their own words and AI-generated text. Human experts scored the stories for dimensions of content, language and organization. We analyzed the basic organization and structure and syntactic complexity of the stories' AI-generated text and performed multiple linear regression and cluster analyses. The results show the number of human words and the number of AI-generated words contribute significantly to scores. Besides, students can be grouped into competent and less competent writers who use more AI-generated text or less AI-generated text compared to their peers.

    "translated_abstract": "以英语作为外语的学生使用人工智能自然语言生成工具生成的文本可能会提高他们的写作质量。然而，目前尚不清楚这些学生的写作中使用人工智能生成文本在多大程度上会导致更高质量的写作。我们探索了23名香港中学生撰写故事（包含自己的文字和人工智能生成的文本）的尝试。人类专家对这些故事进行了内容、语言和组织方面的评分。我们分析了故事中的AI生成文本的基本组织结构和句法复杂度，并执行了多元线性回归和聚类分析。结果表明，人类词语的数量和人工智能生成词语的数量对分数有重要贡献。此外，与同龄人相比，学生的写作可以分为擅长和不擅长使用更多或更少人工智能生成文本的两组。聚类比较显示，使用人工智能生成文本在学生写作中有一定好处，但同时也强调了过度依赖这种工具的潜在风险。",
