    "abstract": "As a newly emerged asset class, cryptocurrency is evidently more volatile compared to the traditional equity markets. Due to its mostly unregulated nature, and often low liquidity, the price of crypto assets can sustain a significant change within minutes that in turn might result in considerable losses. In this paper, we employ an approach for encoding market information into images and making predictions of short-term realized volatility by employing Convolutional Neural Networks. We then compare the performance of the proposed encoding and corresponding model with other benchmark models. The experimental results demonstrate that this representation of market data with a Convolutional Neural Network as a predictive model has the potential to better capture the market dynamics and a better volatility prediction.",

    "translated_abstract": "作为新兴的资产类别，加密货币相比传统的股票市场明显更具波动性。由于其大多数时候是无监管的，流动性通常较低，加密资产的价格在几分钟内就可出现显著变动，这可能会导致巨额损失。在本文中，我们采用将市场信息编码成图像并利用卷积神经网络进行短期实现波动率预测的方法。然后，我们将所提出的编码和相应的模型的表现与其他基准模型进行比较。实验结果表明，使用卷积神经网络作为预测模型的市场数据表示方法有潜力更好地捕捉市场动态并实现更好的波动率预测。",
