    "abstract": "Automated fact-checking is often presented as an epistemic tool that fact-checkers, social media consumers, and other stakeholders can use to fight misinformation. Nevertheless, few papers thoroughly discuss how. We document this by analysing 100 highly-cited papers, and annotating epistemic elements related to intended use, i.e., means, ends, and stakeholders. We find that narratives leaving out some of these aspects are common, that many papers propose inconsistent means and ends, and that the feasibility of suggested strategies rarely has empirical backing. We argue that this vagueness actively hinders the technology from reaching its goals, as it encourages overclaiming, limits criticism, and prevents stakeholder feedback. Accordingly, we provide several recommendations for thinking and writing about the use of fact-checking artefacts.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动事实核查经常被呈现为一个知识工具，事实核查员、社交媒体消费者和其他利益相关者可以使用它来打击错误信息。然而，很少有论文深入讨论如何使用。我们通过分析100篇高被引用论文并注释与预期使用相关的认知元素（即手段、目的和利益相关者）来记录这一点。我们发现，忽略其中一些方面的叙事很普遍，许多论文提出的手段和目的不一致，并且推荐策略的可行性很少具有实证支持。我们认为这种模糊性主动阻碍了技术实现其目标，因为它鼓励了过度宣传，限制了批评并阻止了利益相关者的反馈。因此，我们提出了几项关于思考和撰写事实核查工具使用的建议。",
