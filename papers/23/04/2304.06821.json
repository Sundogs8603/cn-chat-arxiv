    "translated_abstract": "本技术报告研究了经典的Bradley-Terry-Luce（BTL）模型中的成对比较排序问题，重点关注得分估计。对于通用图，我们表明，通过足够多的样本，最大似然估计（MLE）可以实现一个符合Cram\\'er-Rao下界的逐元估计误差，这可以用有效电阻来说明；我们分析的关键是统计估计和通过预处理梯度下降进行迭代优化之间的联系。我们还特别关注具有局部性质的图，其中仅相邻项之间可以连接边缘；我们的分析确定了局部性不会影响的条件，即在图中距离较远的一对项目之间进行得分比较几乎与比较相邻项目对一对项目相似。我们进一步探讨了分治算法，即使在最稀疏的样本区域内，也可以证明能够实现类似的保证，并享受本地方法的计算效率。",
