    "translated_abstract": "人类擅长不断从不断变化的环境中获取、巩固和保留信息，而人工神经网络则表现出灾难性遗忘。生物神经网络和它们的人工对应物在突触复杂性、信息处理和学习机制方面存在显著差异，这可能解释了性能上的不匹配。我们考虑一个生物可行的框架，其中包括完全兴奋和抑制神经元的单独种群，遵循戴尔原则，并为兴奋的锥体神经元增加了类似树突的结构，用于上下文相关的刺激处理。然后我们对受脑启发的不同机制进行了全面研究，包括稀疏不重叠表示、赫布学习、突触巩固和重播伴随学习事件的过去激活。我们的解决方案在基于序列的持续学习基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并展示了考虑这些机制在生物可行的框架中相互作用的重要性。",
