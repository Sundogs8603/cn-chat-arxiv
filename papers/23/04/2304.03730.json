    "translated_abstract": "目前，人-机器人协作对话系统（例如，在电子商务中的售前和售后）是无处不在的，而对话路由组件对于提高整体效率，降低人力成本和增强用户体验至关重要。尽管大多数现有方法可以满足这一要求，但它们只能对单一来源的对话数据进行建模，并且不能有效地捕获数据和子任务之间的关系的基础知识。在本文中，我们通过彻底挖掘各种类型的对话数据之间的数据-任务和任务-任务知识，来研究这个重要问题。为了实现上述目标，我们提出了一个门控机制增强的多任务模型（G3M），具体包括一种新型对话编码器和两个量身定制的门控机制模块。所提出的方法可以发挥层次化信息过滤的作用，并且不会对现有的对话系统产生影响。基于从现实世界应用程序收集的两个数据集，进行了广泛的实验结果研究。",
