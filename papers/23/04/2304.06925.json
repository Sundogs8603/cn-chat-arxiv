    "translated_abstract": "无人机远程感应目标探测技术已广泛应用于许多领域，并成为计算机视觉领域的主要研究方向。然而，由于物体大小、图像降噪和实时性等因素的挑战，小尺度物体的可靠检测一直是具有挑战性的。为解决这些问题，提出了一种实时物体检测算法(YOLO-Drone)，并将其应用于两种新的无人机平台以及一种特定的光源(硅基金LED)。YOLO-Drone提出了几个创新：1)包括一个新的骨干Darknet59；2)一个新的复杂特征聚合模块MSPP-FPN，它包括一个空间金字塔池化和三个扩张空间金字塔池化模块；3)使用广义交集联盟(Generalized Intersection over Union，GIOU)作为损失函数。为了评估性能，使用了两个基准数据集，结果表明YOLO-Drone在小物体检测方面实现了最优结果。",
