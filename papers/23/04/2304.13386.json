    "translated_abstract": "神经放射场（NeRF）由于其优异的质量和灵活性在新颖视角合成中取得了很大的成功。但是，NeRF需要密集的输入视图（几十到几百个）和长时间的训练时间（几小时到几天）才能为单个场景生成高保真度的图像。虽然使用体素网格表示放射场可以显著加速优化过程，但我们注意到，在稀疏输入的情况下，体素网格更容易过度拟合训练视图，会产生空洞和漂浮物，导致伪影。在本文中，我们提出了VGOS，一种从稀疏输入（3-10个视图）快速（3-5分钟）重建放射场的方法来解决这些问题。为了改善基于体素的放射场在稀疏输入场景中的性能，我们提出了两种方法：（a）我们引入了增量体素训练策略，在重建早期抑制周边体素的优化，以防止过度拟合。",
