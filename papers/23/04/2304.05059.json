For the graph, a significant challenge is that the topological properties of the nodes (e.g., locations, roles) are unbalanced (topology-imbalance), other than the number of training labeled nodes (quantity-imbalance). Existing studies on topology-imbalance focus on the location or the local neighborhood structure of nodes, ignoring the global underlying hierarchical properties of the graph, i.e., hierarchy. In the real-world scenario, the hierarchical structure of graph data reveals important topological properties of graphs and is relevant to a wide range of applications. We find that training labeled nodes with different hierarchical properties have a significant impact on the node classification tasks and confirm it in our experiments.

    "translated_abstract": "对于图中不平衡节点的学习已成为一个更为显著和重要的问题。图中一个重要的挑战是节点的拓扑特性（例如位置，角色）的不平衡（拓扑不平衡），而不仅仅是训练标记节点的数量（数量不平衡）。现有的关于拓扑不平衡的研究集中在节点的位置或者局部邻域结构上，忽略了图的全局底层分层属性，即层级。在现实世界中，图数据的分层结构揭示了图的重要拓扑属性并与广泛的应用相关。我们发现以不同层次属性训练标记节点对节点分类任务具有重要的影响，并在我们的实验中加以证实。众所周知，双曲几何在表示图的层次结构方面具有独特优势。",
