    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了FengWu，一种基于人工智能的先进数据驱动的全球中期天气预报系统。与现有的数据驱动天气预报方法不同，FengWu从多模态和多任务的角度解决了中期预报问题。具体来说，我们精心设计了一个深度学习体系结构，配备了模型特定的编码器-解码器和跨模态融合Transformer，通过不确定性损失的监督学习，在区域自适应的方式下平衡不同预测器的优化。此外，引入了回放缓冲区机制来提高中期预报性能。在基于ERA5再分析的39年数据训练下，FengWu能够准确地复制大气动力学并在0.25{\\deg}纬度-经度分辨率上预测未来的陆地和大气状态。基于ERA5的2018年6小时长期预报表明，FengWu表现优异。",
