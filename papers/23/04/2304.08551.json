    "translated_abstract": "视觉是音乐体验的核心组成部分，因为它们可以放大音乐传达的情感和信息。然而，创造音乐可视化是一个复杂、耗时和资源密集的过程。我们介绍了Generative Disco，一个生成式人工智能系统，利用大型语言模型和文本到图像模型帮助生成音乐可视化。用户选择要可视化的音乐间隔，然后通过定义开始和结束提示来参数化该可视化。这些提示根据音乐的节奏进行变形和生成，以产生反应音频的视频。我们介绍了改进生成视频的设计模式：“过渡”，表达颜色、时间、主题或风格的变化，“保持”，鼓励视觉重点和一致性。专业人员参与的研究表明，该系统具有愉悦性、易于探索和高度表现力。我们总结了Generative Disco在专业人士中的应用案例以及AI生成内容与版权的联系。",
