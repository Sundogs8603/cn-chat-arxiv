    "translated_abstract": "生物医学成像中基于数据的细胞跟踪和分割方法需要多样化和信息丰富的训练数据。当训练样本数量有限时，可以使用合成的计算机生成数据集来提高这些方法的准确性。这需要使用生成模型合成细胞形状以及相应的显微镜图像。为了合成逼真的活细胞形态，生成模型使用的形状表示应能够准确表示细节和拓扑变化，这在细胞中很常见。这些要求并不适用于3D体素掩模，因为它们有分辨率限制，也不适用于多边形网格，因为无法易于模拟细胞增长和有丝分裂等过程。在本文中，我们提出使用有符号距离函数（SDFs）的水平集来表示活细胞形状，这些水平集由神经网络估计得出，而且对旋转具有等变性。我们还介绍了一种将此表示转换为网格和RGB图像以进行可视化和用于下游计算机视觉任务的方法。",
