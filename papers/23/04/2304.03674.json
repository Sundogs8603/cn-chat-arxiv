    "translated_abstract": "在近年来，机器学习取得了长足的进步，成为许多不同应用领域突破的根源。然而，如何将它们应用到高风险或安全关键的应用领域仍然是一个未解决的问题，因为它们往往容易变得脆弱和不可靠。本文认为，需求定义和满足可以在很大程度上使机器学习模型更适用于现实世界中的关键领域。为此，我们提出了两个问题，其中（i）需求自然而然地出现，（ii）机器学习模型被或可以成功地部署，并且（iii）忽略需求可能会产生严重后果。我们展示了如何将需求规格说明有益地整合到标准的机器学习开发流程中，提出了一种新型的金字塔式开发流程，在其中，需求定义可能会影响到流程中所有后续阶段，反之亦然。",
