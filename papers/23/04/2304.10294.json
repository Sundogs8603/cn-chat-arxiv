    "translated_abstract": "基础模型是大型机器学习模型，一旦训练完成即可解决各种下游任务，在自然语言处理、计算机视觉和强化学习等领域引领研究趋势。然而，目前还没有适用于光学多层薄膜结构反向设计的基础模型。当前的反向设计算法要么不能探索全局设计空间，要么计算效率低下。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了Opto Generative Pretrained Transformer（OptoGPT）。OptoGPT是一个仅包含解码器的Transformer，可以根据特定的频谱目标自回归地生成设计。通过训练一组大型数据集（1000万个设计），我们的模型展现了卓越的能力: 1）自主全局设计探索，通过确定层数（高达20层），同时选择每个层的材料（高达18种不同类型）和厚度；2）高效的结构颜色设计，吸收器，滤波器，分布反射镜。",
