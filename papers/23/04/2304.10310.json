    "abstract": "Automated augmentation is an emerging and effective technique to search for data augmentation policies to improve generalizability of deep neural network training. Most existing work focuses on constructing a unified policy applicable to all data samples in a given dataset, without considering sample or class variations. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage data augmentation algorithm, named Label-Aware AutoAugment (LA3), which takes advantage of the label information, and learns augmentation policies separately for samples of different labels. LA3 consists of two learning stages, where in the first stage, individual augmentation methods are evaluated and ranked for each label via Bayesian Optimization aided by a neural predictor, which allows us to identify effective augmentation techniques for each label under a low search cost. And in the second stage, a composite augmentation policy is constructed out of a selection of effective as well as complementary augmentations, which ",
