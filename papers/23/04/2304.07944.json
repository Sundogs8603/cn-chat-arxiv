    "abstract": "Conversational search has seen increased recent attention in both the IR and NLP communities.

However, most existing systems are trained and demonstrated with recorded or artificial conversation logs. Eventually, conversational search systems should be trained, evaluated, and deployed in an open-ended setting with unseen conversation trajectories. A key challenge is that training and evaluating such systems both require a human-in-the-loop, which is expensive and does not scale. One strategy for this is to simulate users, thereby reducing the scaling costs. However, current user simulators are either limited to only respond to yes-no questions from the conversational search system, or unable to produce high quality responses in general.  In this paper, we show that current state-of-the-art user simulation system could be significantly improved by replacing it with a smaller but advanced",

    "translated_abstract": "对话式搜索在信息检索和自然语言处理领域引起了广泛关注。它通过多次自然语言交互来澄清和解决用户的搜索需求。然而，大多数现有系统是通过记录或人工对话日志进行训练和演示的。最终，对话式搜索系统应该在未见过的对话轨迹的开放环境中进行训练、评估和部署。一个关键的挑战是训练和评估这样的系统都需要人工参与，这既昂贵又不可扩展。其中一种策略是模拟用户，以此来减少扩展成本。然而，当前的用户模拟器要么仅限于对对话搜索系统的是非问题进行回答，要么无法产生高质量的响应。本文表明，通过用一个更小但先进的系统来替换当前最先进的用户模拟系统，能够大幅改进其性能。",
