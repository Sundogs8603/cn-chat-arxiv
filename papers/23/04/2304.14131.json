    "translated_abstract": "气象雷达反射率数据（也称为回波）在预测降水和进行短期强降雨的精确快速预测方面发挥着至关重要的作用。与传统模型相比，基于深度学习的雷达回波外推算法更加有效和高效。然而，高度可靠且具有广泛适用性的算法的发展受到三个主要瓶颈的制约：累积误差扩散、稀疏回波分布的不精确表示以及非平稳运动过程的不准确描述。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种利用时空相关特征和Transformer技术的新型雷达回波外推算法。该算法从多帧回波图像中提取特征，准确地表示了降水的非平稳运动过程。所提出的算法使用一种新的并行Temporal-Spatial Parallel Transformer（TempEE），确保了在雷达回波外推中的高准确性和高效率。此外，该算法克服了传统NWP模型和自回归算法的局限性，能够准确地在回波持续时间之外进行外推。在三个真实数据集上，所提出的算法优于现有最先进的方法，展示了其实际应用的潜力。",
