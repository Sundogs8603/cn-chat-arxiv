    "translated_abstract": "普适计算在许多重要的领域中提供服务，包括健康和福利这个相关且动态的领域。在这个领域中，人类活动识别（HAR）在近年来引起了很多关注。目前的解决方案依赖于机器学习（ML）模型并取得了令人印象深刻的结果。然而，这些模型的演进仍然很困难，除非进行完整的重新训练。为了解决这个问题，连续学习的概念在今天非常有前途，尤其是基于正则化的技术。这些技术非常有趣，因为它们很简单并且成本低。已经进行了初步的研究，并展示了有希望的结果。然而，它们仍然非常专业化并且难以比较。在本文中，我们提供了三种基于正则化的方法在HAR领域的全面比较，并突出它们的优点和局限性。我们的实验基于公开可用的数据集进行，结果表明这些方法提高了模型学习新类别的能力，同时保持了模型在先前学习的类别上的准确性。",
