    "translated_abstract": "构象生成是药物发现和化学信息学中的基本问题，有机分子构象生成，特别是在真空和蛋白质口袋环境中，与药物设计最相关。最近，随着几何神经网络的发展，数据驱动的方案已成功应用于这一领域，包括分子构象生成（在真空中）和结合位姿生成（在蛋白质口袋中）。前者打败了传统的ETKDG方法，而后者达到了与广泛使用的分子对接软件相似的精度。尽管这些方法已经显示出了有希望的结果，但一些研究人员最近质疑深度学习（DL）方法是否通过无参数方法更好地在分子构象生成中表现。令人惊讶的是，他们设计的方法有点类似于著名的无限猴子定理，这些猴子甚至装备了物理教育。本文旨在讨论该方法的可行性，并且通过简单的实验，我们发现传统的基于物理的方法仍然是构象生成问题中的有力选项。",
