    "translated_abstract": "在股票市场，成功的投资需要在利润和风险之间取得良好的平衡。最近，在量化投资中广泛研究了股票推荐，以为投资者选择具有更高收益率的股票。尽管在获利方面取得了成功，但大多数现有的推荐方法仍然在风险控制方面较弱，这可能导致实际股票投资中难以承受的亏损。为了有效降低风险，我们从对抗性扰动中获得启示，并提出了一种新的基于分离变分对抗训练（SVAT）框架的风险感知型股票推荐方法。本质上，SVAT鼓励模型对风险股票样本的对抗性扰动敏感，并通过学习扰动来增强模型的风险意识。为了生成代表性的风险指标对抗样本，我们设计了一个变分扰动生成器来模拟不同的风险因素。特别地，变分结构使我们的方法能够捕捉难以明确量化和建模的各种风险因素。在真实股票数据上的综合实验表明，SVAT在降低投资风险的同时保持高预期收益上非常有效。",
