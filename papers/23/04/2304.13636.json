In such domains, data preparation remains a significant challenge in developing accurate models, requiring significant expertise and time investment to search the huge search space of well-suited data curation and transformation tools. To address this challenge, we present AutoCure, a novel and configuration-free data curation pipeline that improves the quality of tabular data. Unlike traditional data curation methods, AutoCure synthetically enhances the density of the clean data fraction through an adaptive ensemble-based error detection method and a data augmentation module. In practice, AutoCure can be integrated with open source tools, e.g., Auto-sklearn, H2O, and TPOT, to promote the democratization of machine learning. As a proof of concept, we provide a comparative evaluation of AutoCure against 28 combinations of traditional data curation tool",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习算法在自动驾驶、医疗保健和金融等多个领域变得越来越普遍。在这些领域中，数据准备仍然是发展准确模型的一个重大挑战，需要大量的专业知识和时间投资来搜索适合的数据整理和转换工具。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了AutoCure，一种新颖且无需配置的数据整理管道，可提高表格数据的质量。与传统的数据整理方法不同，AutoCure通过自适应集成的误差检测方法和数据增强模块，从合乎规范的数据部分中增强了清晰数据分数的密度。在实践中，AutoCure可以与开源工具（例如Auto-sklearn、H2O和TPOT）集成，以推动机器学习的民主化。作为一个概念验证，我们提供了AutoCure与28种传统数据整理工具组合的比较评估。",
