    "abstract": "Prediction of chemical shift in NMR using machine learning methods is typically done with the maximum amount of data available to achieve the best results. In some cases, such large amounts of data are not available, e.g. for heteronuclei. We demonstrate a novel machine learning model which is able to achieve good results with comparatively low amounts of data. We show this by predicting 19F and 13C NMR chemical shifts of small molecules in specific solvents.",
