    "translated_abstract": "响应曲线展示了一个敏感系统对不同刺激的响应程度。然而，这类系统的反应可能对多个不一定独立的刺激（即输入特征）敏感。因此，为了一个选定的输入特征（称为“活动特征”）所生成的响应曲线的形状可能依赖于其他输入特征（称为“被动特征”）的值。在这项工作中，我们考虑了使用回归神经网络逼近响应的系统。我们提出使用反事实解释（CFEs）来确定通过神经网络黑盒生成的响应曲线上最具相关性的特征。 CFE是通过基于遗传算法的方法生成的，该方法解决了多目标优化问题。特别地，对于为主动特征生成的响应曲线，CFE找到需要修改的被动特征的最小组合，以改变曲线的形状。我们将我们的方法应用于两个工业资产预测维护的案例研究中，其中黑盒回归模型生成的响应曲线用于检测异常。我们演示了如何使用CFEs来解释这些模型的行为，并检测异常行为的潜在原因。",
