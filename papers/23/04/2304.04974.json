    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has gained a remarkable success thanks to recent advances of deep learning, but it usually degrades significantly under real-world noisy conditions. Recent works introduce speech enhancement (SE) as front-end to improve speech quality, which is proved effective but may not be optimal for downstream ASR due to speech distortion problem. Based on that, latest works combine SE and currently popular self-supervised learning (SSL) to alleviate distortion and improve noise robustness. Despite the effectiveness, the speech distortion caused by conventional SE still cannot be completely eliminated. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework named Wav2code to implement a generalized SE without distortions for noise-robust ASR. First, in pre-training stage the clean speech representations from SSL model are sent to lookup a discrete codebook via nearest-neighbor feature matching, the resulted code sequence are then exploited to reconstruct the origin",

    "translated_abstract": "自动语音识别(ASR)由于深度学习的最新进展已经取得了显著的成功，但在实际嘈杂环境下，其性能通常会显著降低。最近的研究将语音增强(SE)引入作为前端来提高语音质量，证明了其有效性，但由于语音失真问题，可能对下游ASR不是最优的。基于这一点，最新的工作将SE和当前流行的自监督学习(SSL)结合起来来缓解失真问题并提高噪声鲁棒性。尽管有效性，但传统SE引起的语音失真仍无法完全消除。本文提出了一种名为Wav2code的自监督框架，用于实现用于噪声鲁棒ASR的无失真广义SE。首先，在预训练阶段，从SSL模型获得干净的语音表征，通过最近邻特征匹配查找离散码本，然后利用得到的代码序列来重构原始音频信号以获得干净的语音表征；接着，该代码序列被用于无失真地增强带噪语音以便于提高语音识别的鲁棒性。",
