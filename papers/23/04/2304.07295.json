    "translated_abstract": "新辅助化疗后准确分割乳腺癌残余肿瘤 (PSRTBC) 是乳腺癌治疗过程中的一个基本关键技术。然而，由于乳腺癌组织和肿瘤细胞在新辅助化疗后常常具有复杂和多种多样的形态学改变，因此产生一个具有良好泛化性能的预测模型仍然是一个挑战。为了缓解这种情况，本文提出了一种基于专家认知驱动的安全噪声标签学习 (ECDSNLL) 方法。ECDSNLL是在安全噪声标签学习的概念下构建的，后者是一种典型的安全弱监督学习方法，它将病理专家对乳腺癌残余肿瘤识别的认知与提供的数据基础上的人工智能专家的数据建模认知相结合。我们展示了所提出的ECDSNLL方法的优势和潜力。",
