    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a problem of equilibrium price formation among many investors with exponential utility. The investors are heterogeneous in their initial wealth, risk-averseness parameter, as well as stochastic liability at the terminal time. We characterize the equilibrium risk-premium process of the risky stocks in terms of the solution to a novel mean-field backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE), whose driver has quadratic growth both in the stochastic integrands and in their conditional expectations. We prove the existence of a solution to the mean-field BSDE under several conditions and show that the resultant risk-premium process actually clears the market in the large population limit.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了多位投资者在初始财富、风险规避参数以及终止时间的随机负债方面存在差异时的均衡价格形成问题。我们通过一个新的均场反向随机微分方程（BSDE）的解来表征风险股票的均衡风险溢价过程，其特征是驱动程序在随机积分和条件期望上都具有二次增长。我们证明了在多个条件下均场BSDE存在解，并且表明随着人口规模的增大，结果风险溢价进程实际上会清除市场。",
