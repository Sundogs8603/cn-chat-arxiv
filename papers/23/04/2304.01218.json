However, the potential adoption of NN controllers in real-life applications also gives rise to a growing concern over the safety of these neural-network controlled systems (NNCSs), especially when used in safety-critical applications. In this work, we present POLAR-Express, an efficient and precise formal reachability analysis tool for verifying the safety of NNCSs. POLAR-Express uses Taylor model arithmetic to propagate Taylor models (TMs) across a neural network layer-by-layer to compute an overapproximation of the neural-network function. It can be applied to analyze any feed-forward neural network with continuous activation functions. We also present a novel approach to propagate TMs more efficiently and precisely across ReLU activation functions. In addition, POLAR-Express provides parallel computation support for the layer-by-layer propagation",

    "translated_abstract": "在挑战性的控制问题上，扮演控制器角色的神经网络 (NN) 展示出了令人印象深刻的实验性能。但神经网络控制系统 (NNCS) 在实际应用中的潜在采用也引起了日益增长的对这些 NNCS 安全性的担忧，特别是在安全关键应用中的使用。本文提出了 POLAR-Express，一种高效且准确的形式可达性分析工具，用于验证 NNCS 的安全性。POLAR-Express 使用 Taylor 模型算术，逐层横跨神经网络来传播 Taylor 模型 (TM) 以计算神经网络函数的近似值。它可以用于分析任何具有连续激活功能的前馈神经网络。我们还提出了一种在 ReLU 激活函数上更有效地精确传播 TM 的新方法。此外，POLAR-Express 为逐层传播提供了并行计算支持。",
