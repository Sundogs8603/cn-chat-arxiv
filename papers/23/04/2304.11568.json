    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一个空间经济增长模型，其中空间被描述为一个互连的地理位置网络，并在带有状态约束的图上研究了相应的有限维最优控制问题。网络上的经济增长模型受到空间经济数据性质的启发，这些数据自然具有图形结构：这使得这些模型非常适合数字实现和校准。与相关文献采用的空间建模为欧几里得空间子集不同，这个网络设置产生了无限维最优控制问题。在介绍模型和相关控制问题后，我们证明了最优控制的存在唯一性和值函数的正则性结果，这为深入研究最优策略奠定了基础。然后，我们集中讨论特定情况，在适当的假设下，可以找到最优控制问题的显式解。我们的数值模拟表明，我们的方法非常适用于公共资源的区域分配和研究不同地区的收入不平等。",

Numerical simulations suggest that this approach is well-suited for regional allocation of public resources and studying income inequality across different regions."
