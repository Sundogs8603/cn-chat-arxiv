    "translated_abstract": "染色体相对于功能性核体的空间定位与基因组功能（如转录）密切相关。然而，影响全基因组范围内染色质空间定位的序列模式和表观遗传特征尚未被很好地理解。在这里，我们开发了一种新的基于Transformer的深度学习模型UNADON，它使用序列特征和表观遗传信号，预测了通过TSA-seq测量的特定类型核体的全基因组细胞学距离。在四种细胞系（K562，H1，HFFc6，HCT116）中对UNADON的评估表明，在单个细胞系训练时，高度准确地预测了染色质空间定位到核体。UNADON在未见过的细胞类型中表现良好。重要的是，我们揭示了影响大尺度染色质区隔到核体的潜在序列和表观遗传因素。综上，UNADON为了解基因组中的序列特征和染色质空间定位的原理提供了新的见解，并为研究核的功能组织提供了有价值的工具。",
