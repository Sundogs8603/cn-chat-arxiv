    "translated_abstract": "我们提供了一个统一的框架来刻画纯粹的和近似的差分隐私学习性。该框架使用了图论的语言:对于一个概念类 $\\mathcal{H}$,我们定义了 $\\mathcal{H}$ 的矛盾图 $G$。它的顶点是可实现的数据集，如果两个数据集 $S$，$S'$ 相互矛盾(即，在 $S$ 和 $S'$ 中有一个点 $x$ 具有不同的标记)，则它们之间有一条边连接。我们的主要发现是，$G$ 的组合结构与在差分隐私下学习 $\\mathcal{H}$ 密切相关。在纯粹的差分隐私下学习 $\\mathcal{H}$ 的捕获为 $G$ 的分数团数。在近似差分隐私下学习 $\\mathcal{H}$ 的捕获为 $G$ 的团数。因此，我们确定了描述差分隐私可学习性的图论维度：团维和分数团维。同时，我们揭示了矛盾图的一些性质，这些性质可能是独立感兴趣的。我们还提出了几种算法来估计 $G$ 的这些度量，通过这些算法，我们实现了几种概念类的实验研究。",

The contradiction graph $G$ of a concept class $\\mathcal{H}$ is defined to capture the combinatorial structure of $\\mathcal{H}$. The fractional clique number and clique number of $G$ capture the learnability of $\\mathcal{H}$ under pure and approximate differential privacy, respectively. The paper also suggests several algorithms to estimate the measures of $G$ and conducts experimental studies on various concept classes."
