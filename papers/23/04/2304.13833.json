In particular, models that use Dirichlet processes as gating functions permit straightforward interpretation and automatic selection of the number of experts in a mixture.

Capitalising on the recent advancement in the dependent Dirichlet processes literature, we propose a new mixture model of Gaussian process experts based on kernel stick-breaking processes.
