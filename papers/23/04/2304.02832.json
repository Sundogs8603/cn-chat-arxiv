    "translated_abstract": "在传统车联网中，车辆生成的计算任务通常上传到云端进行处理。然而，由于任务卸载会导致大量延迟，因此引入了车辆边缘计算 (VEC) 技术，它使用具有一定计算能力的路侧单元 (RSU) 作为边缘实体来处理车辆的数据。由于隐私和安全问题，车辆不愿直接上传本地数据到 RSU，因此联邦学习 (FL) 成为 VEC 中某些机器学习任务的一种有前途的技术，车辆只需要上传本地模型超参数而不是将本地数据转移到附近的 RSU。此外，由于车辆具有不同的本地训练时间，因为本地数据的大小和不同的计算能力，所以采用异步联邦学习 (AFL) 来促进 RSU 从所有参与车辆的聚合本地更新中更新全局模型。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于深度强化学习的 AFL-VEC 车辆选择算法，该算法可以选择具有高计算能力和通信能力的最适合的车辆参与 AFL 进程，以提高整体训练性能。仿真结果表明，与其他最先进的算法相比，所提出的算法可以实现更好的训练精度和更低的通信开销。",
