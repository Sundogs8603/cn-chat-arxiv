    "abstract": "This paper describes the participation of team QUST in the SemEval2023 task 3. The monolingual models are first evaluated with the under-sampling of the majority classes in the early stage of the task. Then, the pre-trained multilingual model is fine-tuned with a combination of the class weights and the sample weights. Two different fine-tuning strategies, the task-agnostic and the task-dependent, are further investigated. All experiments are conducted under the 10-fold cross-validation, the multilingual approaches are superior to the monolingual ones. The submitted system achieves the second best in Italian and Spanish (zero-shot) in subtask-1.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文描述了QUST团队参加SemEval2023任务3的情况。首先，单语模型在任务早期对多数类进行了欠采样评估。然后，使用类权重和样本权重的组合对预训练的多语模型进行了微调。进一步研究两种不同的微调策略，分别为任务不可知和任务相关的。所有实验都在10折交叉验证下进行，多语方法比单语方法更具优势。提交的系统在意大利语和西班牙语（零样本）的子任务1中取得了第二名。",

The combination of class weight and sample weight to fine-tune pre-trained multilingual models can address the issue of class imbalance. The submitted system ranked second in Subtask 1 for Italian and Spanish in zero-shot settings in SemEval2023 Task 3."
