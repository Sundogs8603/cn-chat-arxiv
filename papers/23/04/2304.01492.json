    "translated_abstract": "大量的谣言伴随着突发新闻或热门话题而传播，这严重阻碍了真相的传播。现有的谣言检测算法展示了在前几天新闻上良好性能的前景，但是由于缺乏训练数据和先前的专业知识，它们很难发现与预期事件有关的谣言，特别是在不同语言（即低资源环境）中传播的谣言。在本文中，我们提出了一个统一的对比传递框架，通过将从充足资源的谣言数据学到的特征适应于低资源情况下的特征来检测谣言。具体来说，我们首先将在社交媒体上传播的谣言表示为无向拓扑结构，然后通过统一对比范式进行Multi-scale图卷积网络的训练。我们的模型明确地突破了领域和/或语言问题的障碍，通过语言对齐和一种新颖的领域自适应对比。",
