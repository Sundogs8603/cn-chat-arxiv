    "translated_abstract": "可解释人工智能（XAI）旨在回答与AI模型部署相关的伦理和法律问题。然而，相当数量的领域特定评论强调需要一个数学基础来定义领域中的关键概念，即使“解释”这个术语还缺乏精确定义。这些评论还主张建立一个健全而统一的可解释AI形式体系，以避免出现不良提出问题，帮助研究人员浏览一个快速增长的知识体系。据作者所知，该论文是填补该空白的首次尝试，通过形式化一个可解释AI的统一理论。采用范畴理论的框架，特别是反馈单调范畴，我们首先提供了可解释AI中所有重要术语的形式定义。然后，我们提出了一个遵循提出结构的领域分类法，展示了如何使用引入的理论来对当前研究的所有主要XAI系统类进行分类。",
