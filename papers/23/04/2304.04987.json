    "translated_abstract": "IoT网络越来越成为新型网络攻击的目标。基于异常检测的方法能够发现新型攻击，但在实践中存在诸多挑战，比如误报警、解释困难和难以实现成本效益。IETF最近发布的厂商使用描述（MUD）标准有望通过明确指定IoT设备预期的网络行为来限制它们的攻击表面。在本文中，我们使用SDN来强制执行和监测每个IoT设备的预期行为，并训练单类分类模型来检测大流量攻击。我们的贡献有四个方面。一是我们开发了一个多级推理模型，通过SDN遥测动态检测MUD合规流量的网络活动中的异常模式，然后对异常流进行数据包检查。这提供了对分布式和直接攻击的强化细粒度可见性，使我们能够精确地隔离大流量来源。二是我们利用MUD减少攻击表面，使我们能够在已知的正常流量模式上训练异常检测器。三是我们介绍了一种使用MUD增强分类器以提高其准确性的新技术。四是我们在一个真实的IoT测试平台上进行了广泛的评估，结果显示我们的方法能够有效地检测大流量攻击，同时保持误报率低。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method to detect volumetric attacks in IoT networks using SDN to monitor and enforce the expected behavior of each device, and leveraging the MUD standard to reduce the attack surface. Anomaly-based detection is achieved through training one-class classifier models on the known normal traffic pattern. The approach was evaluated in a realistic IoT testbed, showing high effectiveness and low false positive rate."
