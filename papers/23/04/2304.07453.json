    "translated_abstract": "时间序列异常检测是一项具有广泛实际应用的挑战性任务。由于标签稀疏性，训练深度异常检测器通常依赖于无监督方法。最近已经致力于时间序列领域自适应，以利用类似领域中的知识。然而，现有解决方案可能会因其稀疏性和多样性而在异常方面受到负面知识转移的影响。受到两个领域之间上下文对齐的实证研究的启发，我们旨在通过自适应地采样两个领域的上下文信息来在两个领域之间传递知识。这是具有挑战性的，因为它需要同时建模复杂的域内时间相关性和跨域相关性，并利用源域的标签信息。为此，我们提出了一个框架将上下文采样和异常检测结合到一个联合学习过程中。我们将上下文采样表述为马尔可夫决策过程，并利用源域的标签信息进行无监督域适应和有监督的异常检测。",
