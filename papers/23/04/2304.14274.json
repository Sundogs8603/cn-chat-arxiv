    "translated_abstract": "同源性原则指相同类别的节点更有可能连接在一起，一直被认为是图神经网络（GNN）在节点分类（NC）任务上性能优越的主要原因。最近，人们提出理论结果认为，即使同源性原则被打破，只要来自同一类别的节点分享相似的邻居模式，GNN的优势仍然存在，这对同源性的有效性提出了质疑。然而，这个论点仅考虑了同类节点的可区分性，忽略了跨类别的可区分性，这是研究同源性效应的不足之处。在本文中，我们首先通过例子证明了上述不足，并认为可区分性的理想情况是同类节点的可区分性小于跨类别节点的可区分性。为了形式化这个想法，更好地理解同源性，我们提出了Contextual Stochastic Block Model for Homophily (CSBM-H)，并进行了全面的实验分析。",
