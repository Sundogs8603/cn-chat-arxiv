    "translated_abstract": "柔性路面主要由于车辆和不利的环境条件而恶化，而裂缝是最常见的恶化机制；其调查通常使用国际定义的分类标准进行手动进行。在南非，已经引入了高清晰度视频图像，可以进行更安全的道路调查。但是，调查仍然是一项繁琐的手动过程。自动检测诸如裂缝之类的缺陷将允许更快地分析道路网络，并潜在地减少人为偏差和错误。该研究对六种最先进的卷积神经网络模型进行了比较，用于裂缝检测。这些模型在ImageNet数据集上进行预训练，并使用包含14000个样本的新现实世界二元裂缝数据集进行微调。还调查了数据集扩充的效果。训练的六个模型中有五个的准确率超过了97％，最高记录的准确率为99.7％。最佳模型部署在云基础架构上，以允许自动检测相机镜头中的裂缝。结果表明，深度学习技术为道路缺陷的自动化检测提供了一种有前途的方法。",
