    "translated_abstract": "电子病历（EHR）是从临床常规护理中生成的，记录了广泛的病人人群有价值的信息，为改善临床实践中的病人管理和干预策略提供了丰富的机会。为了利用EHR数据的巨大潜力，机器学习中流行的EHR数据分析范式是EHR表示学习，它首先利用单个病人的EHR数据通过一个主干学习信息丰富的表示，并支持建立在这些表示的多样化的医疗下游任务。然而，这种范式无法深入分析病人的相关性，通常在临床实践中被称为队列研究。具体来说，同一队列中的病人倾向于具有相似的特征，表明他们在医疗条件（如症状或疾病）方面具有相似之处。在本文中，我们提出了一种通用COhort Representation lEarning (CORE)框架来增强EHR表示学习，通过使用队列表示学习算法，对群体信息进行建模并支持针对不同队列的特征进行可解释性分析。",
