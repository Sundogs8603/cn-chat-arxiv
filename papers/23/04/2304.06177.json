    "abstract": "As technology progresses, smart automated systems will serve an increasingly important role in the agricultural industry. Current existing vision systems for yield estimation face difficulties in occlusion and scalability as they utilize a camera system that is large and expensive, which are unsuitable for orchard environments. To overcome these problems, this paper presents a size measurement method combining a machine learning model and depth images captured from three low cost RGBD cameras to detect and measure the height and width of tomatoes. The performance of the presented system is evaluated on a lab environment with real tomato fruits and fake leaves to simulate occlusion in the real farm environment. To improve accuracy by addressing fruit occlusion, our three-camera system was able to achieve a height measurement accuracy of 0.9114 and a width accuracy of 0.9443.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着技术的进步，智能自动化系统将在农业行业中扮演越来越重要的角色。当前用于产量估计的现有视觉系统面临着遮挡和可扩展性方面的困难，因为它们采用的相机系统大且昂贵，不适合果园环境。为了克服这些问题，本文提出了一种尺寸测量方法，结合机器学习模型和从三个低成本的RGBD相机捕捉的深度图像来检测和测量番茄的高度和宽度。该系统在实验室环境下使用真实的番茄果实和假叶进行了性能评估，以模拟真实农场环境中的遮挡。为了通过解决水果遮挡来提高准确性，我们的三摄像头系统能够实现高度测量精度为0.9114，宽度精度为0.9443。",
