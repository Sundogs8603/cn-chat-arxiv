    "translated_abstract": "后门攻击是一种严重威胁深度神经网络模型的攻击手段，攻击者通过注入带有触发信号的输入数据（如补丁）来激活预先植入的恶意行为。触发信号反演是一种有效的后门模型识别和对植入进去的恶意行为进行理解的方法。现有方法在反演触发信号时会有许多不同的构造方式，但因为采用了一些过于具体的假设或者攻击方式特定的限制，这些方法就无法泛化到各种类型的触发信号上。根本原因是现有工作没有考虑触发器设计空间对反演问题的影响。本文正式定义和分析了不同空间中嵌入的触发器及其反演问题，然后提出了一个基于反演问题的触发器形式化定义和分析识别后门模型内部行为的统一框架。我们的原型 UNICORN 在泛化性和有效性方面表现优异。",
