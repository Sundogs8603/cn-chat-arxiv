    "abstract": "The ability of image and video generation models to create photorealistic images has reached unprecedented heights, making it difficult to distinguish between real and fake images in many cases. However, despite this progress, a gap remains between the quality of generated images and those found in the real world. To address this, we have reviewed a vast body of literature from both academic publications and social media to identify qualitative shortcomings in image generation models, which we have classified into five categories. By understanding these failures, we can identify areas where these models need improvement, as well as develop strategies for detecting deep fakes. The prevalence of deep fakes in today's society is a serious concern, and our findings can help mitigate their negative impact.",

    "translated_abstract": "图像和视频生成模型创造出逼真的影像的能力已经达到了前所未有的高度，这使得在许多情况下很难区分真实和伪造的图像。然而，尽管取得了进展，但生成图像的质量和真实世界中的图像之间仍存在差距。为了解决这个问题，我们回顾了大量学术论文和社交媒体内容，以确定图像生成模型的定性缺陷，并将其分类为五类。通过了解这些失败，我们可以确定这些模型需要改进的领域，并制定检测Deepfakes的策略。今天社会中Deepfakes的普遍存在是一个严重的问题，我们的研究发现可以帮助减轻它们的负面影响。",
