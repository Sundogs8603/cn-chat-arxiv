    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人工智能在自然语言处理领域取得了许多进展，LLM技术的出现使得人类可以更好地访问或生成内容。目前关于LLM技术生成工具的研究主要关注这些工具在生成相关内容（代码、文本或图像）方面的性能。然而，与生成工具设计和使用相关的伦理问题似乎越来越多，这影响了特定任务的公众可接受性。本文通过问卷调查，基于测量使用意愿的经验模型（Davis, 1989的TAM和Venkatesh等人的UTAUT2），旨在确定IT公司员工在工作环境中使用生成工具的意愿。结果显示，虽然对生成工具的可接受性评价较为一般，但工具的实用性被认为越高，使用意愿就越强烈。此外，我们的分析表明……（未完整公开）。",

The study used a questionnaire survey based on empirical models measuring intention to use and found that tools perceived to be more useful were more likely to be accepted and used."
