    "abstract": "Multiword expressions are a key ingredient for developing large-scale and linguistically sound natural language processing technology. This paper describes our improvements in automatically identifying Romanian multiword expressions on the corpus released for the PARSEME v1.2 shared task. Our approach assumes a multilingual perspective based on the recently introduced lateral inhibition layer and adversarial training to boost the performance of the employed multilingual language models. With the help of these two methods, we improve the F1-score of XLM-RoBERTa by approximately 2.7% on unseen multiword expressions, the main task of the PARSEME 1.2 edition. In addition, our results can be considered SOTA performance, as they outperform the previous results on Romanian obtained by the participants in this competition.",

    "translated_abstract": "多词表达是开发大规模、语言学上可靠的自然语言处理技术的关键因素。本文描述了我们在PARSEM v1.2共享任务语料库上自动识别罗马尼亚语多词表达方面所做的改进。我们的方法基于最近引入的横向抑制层和对抗训练的多语言视角，以提高所采用的多语言语言模型的性能。在这两种方法的帮助下，我们提高了XLM-RoBERTa在未见过的多词表达方面的F1分数，也就是PARSEME 1.2版本的主要任务，约为2.7%。此外，我们的结果可以被认为是最先进技术，因为它们超过了本次比赛中参赛者在罗马尼亚语方面的先前结果。",
