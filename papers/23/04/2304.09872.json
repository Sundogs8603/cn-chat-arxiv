    "abstract": "We propose a framework for descriptively analyzing sets of partial orders based on the concept of depth functions. Despite intensive studies of depth functions in linear and metric spaces, there is very little discussion on depth functions for non-standard data types such as partial orders. We introduce an adaptation of the well-known simplicial depth to the set of all partial orders, the union-free generic (ufg) depth. Moreover, we utilize our ufg depth for a comparison of machine learning algorithms based on multidimensional performance measures. Concretely, we analyze the distribution of different classifier performances over a sample of standard benchmark data sets. Our results promisingly demonstrate that our approach differs substantially from existing benchmarking approaches and, therefore, adds a new perspective to the vivid debate on the comparison of classifiers.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个框架，基于深度函数对偏序集合进行描述性分析。尽管深度函数在线性和度量空间中进行了大量研究，但是对于偏序等非标准数据类型的深度函数的讨论却很少。我们介绍了著名的单纯深度的偏序版本-无并通用深度（ufg depth）。此外，我们利用我们的 ufg depth 来比较基于多维性能度量的机器学习算法。具体地，我们分析不同分类器在标准基准数据集样本上的表现分布。我们的结果有希望地证明了我们的方法与现有基准方法有很大不同，因此为分类器比较的激烈辩论增加了新的视角。",
