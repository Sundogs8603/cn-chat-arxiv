    "translated_abstract": "健康领域的文献通常会使用受控词汇的语义概念（即术语）进行注释。随着这些文献数量的增加，注释工作越来越多地由算法完成。与人类相比，自动标引算法存在不完美性，可能会错误地将术语分配给文献，从而影响包含这些术语的查询的后续搜索任务。本研究旨在理解在布尔语义搜索中使用不完美分配术语的性能影响。我们使用MeSH术语和生物医学文献搜索作为案例研究。我们在由MeSH术语组成的真实布尔查询上实现了多个自动标引算法，并发现（1）概率逻辑比传统的布尔逻辑更能处理错误分配的术语，（2）查询级性能主要受查询中性能最低的术语限制，以及（3）将少量人工标引与自动标引混合使用可以恢复出色的查询性能。",
