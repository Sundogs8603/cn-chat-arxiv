    "translated_abstract": "最近文本到图像生成技术在建筑设计中得到了认可。我们的研究首次探讨了文本到图像生成器在建筑设计早期阶段支持创造力的潜力。我们与17名建筑学生进行了实验室研究，使用了三种流行的文本到图像生成器——Midjourney、稳定扩散和DALL-E，设计了一个文化中心的概念。通过标准问卷和小组访谈，我们发现当仔细考虑设计约束时，图像生成可以成为设计过程的重要组成部分。生成工具支持意外的创意发现和富有想象力的心态，丰富了设计过程。我们确定了图像生成器面临的一些挑战，并提出了软件开发和教育工作者的考虑，以支持创造力并强调设计师的想象力。通过了解文本到图像生成技术的限制和潜力，建筑师可以更好地利用这项技术来促进创造力。",
