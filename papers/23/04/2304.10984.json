    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了信息饱和批次置信树（IBBT）算法，用于解决运动和传感器不确定性下的运动规划问题。该算法将随机运动规划问题分为确定性运动规划问题和图搜问题两部分，使用基于采样的方法构建一个标准轨迹的图，并计算出原问题的信息启发式代价。最后，通过使用所提出的启发式策略，搜索标准轨迹的图来生成置信度树。IBBT采用所提出的策略，交替进行状态采样，标准轨迹图构建，启发式计算和图搜以找到置信度空间的运动规划。IBBT是一种任何时候的增量算法，随着批次样本数量的不断增加，算法找到的运动规划会逐渐趋向于最优结果，因此效率很高，且可以在不同样本集之间重复利用结果。",
