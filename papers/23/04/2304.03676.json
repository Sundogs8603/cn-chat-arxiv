    "abstract": "As the United States is witnessing elevated racial differences pertaining to economic disparities, we have found a unique example contrary to the traditional narrative. Idaho is the only US state where Blacks earn more than Whites and all other races. In this paper, we examine how Idaho Blacks might have achieved economic success and, more importantly, what factors might have led to this achievement in reducing racial and economic disparities. Preliminary research suggests that fewer barriers to land ownership, smaller populations, well-knit communities, men's involvement in the family, and a relatively less hostile environment have played a significant role. Further research by historians can help the nation uncover the underlying factors to see if some factors are transportable to other parts of the country.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着美国经济不平等问题的加剧，我们发现了一个与传统议题背道而驰的独特案例。爱达荷州是全美唯一黑人收入超过白人和其他种族的州。本文研究了爱达荷州黑人如何实现经济成功，并探讨了有哪些因素导致了减少种族和经济差距的成就。初步研究表明，土地所有权障碍较少、人口较少、社区联系紧密、男性参与家庭和相对较少的敌对环境都发挥了重要作用。历史学家的进一步研究可以帮助国家揭示潜在因素，以确定某些因素是否可以适用于其他地区。",
