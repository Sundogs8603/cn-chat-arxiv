    "translated_abstract": "越界证据感知假新闻检测旨在对新闻和基于新闻内容检索的证据进行推理，以查找统一性或不一致性。然而，我们发现，证据感知检测模型会受到偏差的影响，即新闻/证据内容和真实/假新闻标签之间的虚假相关性，并且很难推广到越界情况。为了应对这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的双重对抗学习方法。我们在DAL中加入了新闻方面和证据方面去偏置鉴别器，它们的目标都是真假新闻标签。然后，DAL会逆向优化新闻方面和证据方面去偏置鉴别器，以减轻新闻和证据内容偏差的影响。同时，DAL还优化主要的假新闻预测器，让新闻-证据交互模块能够被学习。这个过程能够帮助我们教新闻检测模型更好地进行新闻证据推理，并将检测假新闻的负面影响降至最低。",
