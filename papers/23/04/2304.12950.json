    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于Shot优化的QML模型方法，该方法对模型性能的影响最小。我们使用混合量子-经典QML模型对MNIST和FMNIST数据集中的分类任务进行测试。首先，我们扫描数据集的短版本和完整版本的Shot数目。我们发现，训练完整版本比训练短版本提供了5-6%的测试准确度，并且训练中的Shot数量可高达10倍。因此，可以减小数据集的大小以加速训练时间。接下来，我们提出了自适应Shot分配方法用于短版本数据集，以优化训练周期内的Shot数量，并评估其对分类准确度的影响。我们使用（a）线性函数，其中Shot数量随着训练周期线性减少，和（b）步函数，其中Shot数量随着训练周期步进式减少。我们注意到，减少Shot数量会导致0.01的损失增加和约4%（1%）的测试准确度降低。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method for shot optimization in quantum machine learning models, which balances the optimization of shot numbers and accuracy through reducing dataset size and adaptive shot allocation. Results show that training the full dataset with increased shots provides higher accuracy, while the proposed adaptive shot allocation method reduces shot numbers with minimal impact on model performance."
