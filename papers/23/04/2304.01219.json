    "abstract": "We propose DoE2Vec, a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based methodology to learn optimization landscape characteristics for downstream meta-learning tasks, e.g., automated selection of optimization algorithms. Principally, using large training data sets generated with a random function generator, DoE2Vec self-learns an informative latent representation for any design of experiments (DoE). Unlike the classical exploratory landscape analysis (ELA) method, our approach does not require any feature engineering and is easily applicable for high dimensional search spaces. For validation, we inspect the quality of latent reconstructions and analyze the latent representations using different experiments. The latent representations not only show promising potentials in identifying similar (cheap-to-evaluate) surrogate functions, but also can significantly boost performances when being used complementary to the classical ELA features in classification tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出DoE2Vec，这是一种基于变分自编码器（VAE）的方法，用于学习优化景观特征，以用于下游元学习任务，例如自动选择优化算法。通过使用随机函数生成器生成的大型训练数据集，DoE2Vec可以自学习任何实验设计（DoE）的信息潜在表达。与经典的探索性景观分析（ELA）方法不同，我们的方法不需要任何特征工程，并且易于应用于高维搜索空间。为了验证，我们检查了潜在重建的质量，并使用不同的实验分析了潜在表达式。这些潜在表达式不仅在识别类似（易于评估）的替代函数上显示出有前途的潜力，而且在分类任务中与经典的ELA特征互补使用时也可以显着提升性能。",

In classification tasks, it significantly improves performance when used complementarily with classical ELA features."
