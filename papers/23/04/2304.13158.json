    "translated_abstract": "在保护频段的1400-1427 MHz的被动空间辐射计中，来自地面源的射频干扰（RFI）是一个问题。随着无线设备的增长和新技术的出现，将这个频谱与其他技术分享的可能性将向这些辐射计引入更多的干扰。然而，该频段可以成为5G及其后续技术的理想中频段频段，因为它具有高容量和良好的覆盖性。当前在SMAP（土壤湿度活动被动卫星）中的射频干扰检测和处理技术依赖于正确检测和丢弃或过滤受污染的数据，导致有价值的信息丢失，特别是在严重射频干扰的情况下。本文提出了一种基于自编码器的射频干扰抑制方法，可以消除被动接收器端接收到的受污染信号中由潜在的共存地面用户（即，5G基站）引起的主要射频干扰，从而潜在地保存宝贵的信息并防止共存问题。该方法表现出比传统的RFI抑制技术更优秀的性能，并具有减轻严重射频干扰情况的潜力，这将使SMAP辐射计可在受射频干扰的区域使用，有益于环境研究。",
