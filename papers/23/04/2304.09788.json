One of the major challenges on mining data streams is concept drift, which requires the learner to discard the current concept and adapt to a new one. Ensemble-based drift detection algorithms have been used successfully to the classification task but usually maintain a fixed size ensemble of learners running the risk of needlessly spending processing time and memory. In this paper we present improvements to the Scale-free Network Regressor (SFNR), a dynamic ensemble-based method for regression that employs social networks theory. In order to detect concept drifts SFNR uses the Adaptive Window (ADWIN) algorithm. Results show improvements in accuracy, especially in concept drift situations and better performance compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms in both real and synthetic data.",

    "translated_abstract": "数据流挖掘是机器学习领域的主要研究之一，因其在许多知识领域中的应用而备受关注。概念漂移是挖掘数据流面临的主要挑战之一，需要学习者放弃当前概念并适应新概念。集成型漂移检测算法已成功用于分类任务，但通常会维护一个固定大小的学习器集合，从而冒着需要不必要地花费处理时间和内存的风险。本文在社交网络理论基础上对比例自由网络回归器(SFNR)进行了改进，它是一种用于回归的动态集成型方法。为了检测概念漂移，SFNR使用自适应窗口(ADWIN)算法。结果显示，在真实数据和合成数据中，SFNR在准确性方面表现出色，特别是在概念漂移情况下，相较于其他现有算法表现更佳。",
