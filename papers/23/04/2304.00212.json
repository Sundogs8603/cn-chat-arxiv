    "abstract": "Real-world medical image segmentation has tremendous long-tailed complexity of objects, among which tail conditions correlate with relatively rare diseases and are clinically significant. A trustworthy medical AI algorithm should demonstrate its effectiveness on tail conditions to avoid clinically dangerous damage in these out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. In this paper, we adopt the concept of object queries in Mask Transformers to formulate semantic segmentation as a soft cluster assignment. The queries fit the feature-level cluster centers of inliers during training. Therefore, when performing inference on a medical image in real-world scenarios, the similarity between pixels and the queries detects and localizes OOD regions. We term this OOD localization as MaxQuery. Furthermore, the foregrounds of real-world medical images, whether OOD objects or inliers, are lesions. The difference between them is less than that between the foreground and background, possibly misleading the object",

    "translated_abstract": "真实医学图像分割中存在着巨大的长尾对象复杂性，其中尾部情况与相对罕见的疾病相关，并在临床上具有显著意义。一种值得信赖的医疗AI算法应该在尾部条件上展现其有效性，避免在这些超出分布(OOD)的情况下造成致命的危害。本文采用目标查询的概念将语义分割表述为软聚类分配，查询在训练期间适应于内部点的特征级聚类中心。因此，在真实世界场景中对医学图像执行推理时，像素与查询之间的相似性可以检测和定位OOD区域。我们将此OOD定位称为MaxQuery。此外，真实医学图像的前景，无论是OOD对象还是内部点，都是病变。它们之间的差异小于前景和背景之间的差异，可能会误导对象",
