    "translated_abstract": "生成语言模型的快速推广带来了数字通信方面的实质性进展，同时也引发了AI生成内容潜在误用的担忧。虽然已经提出了许多检测方法来区分AI和人类生成的内容，但这些检测器的公平性和鲁棒性仍未得到充分探讨。在这项研究中，我们使用来自英语母语和非英语母语作者的写作样本评估了几种广泛使用的GPT检测器的性能表现。我们的研究发现，这些检测器持续将非英语母语的写作样本错误地分类为AI生成的内容，而原生写作样本则能够被准确识别。此外，我们证明了简单的提示策略不仅可以缓解这种偏见，而且还可以有效地规避GPT检测器，这表明GPT检测器可能无意中惩罚具有受限语言表达能力的作者。我们的研究结果呼吁进行更广泛的讨论。",
