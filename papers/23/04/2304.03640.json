    "translated_abstract": "鉴于智能电网系统安全和隐私日益受到关注，针对关键电网组件（例如状态估计）的网络攻击已经被证明是网络安全问题的重点，近年来得到了重视。然而，智能电网中的网络攻击检测面临着新的挑战，包括隐私保护和具有战略数据所有者的分散电力区域。为了解决这些技术瓶颈，本文提出了一种新颖的基于联邦学习的隐私保护和通信高效的攻击检测框架，称为 FedDiSC，它能够区分电力系统干扰和网络攻击。具体而言，我们首先提出了联邦学习方法，使分散式电网区域的监视和数据采集子系统能够协作训练一种攻击检测模型，而无需共享敏感的电力相关数据。其次，我们提出了一种表示学习方法，从训练数据中提取判别特征，能够提高检测性能。第三，我们设计了一种基于卷积神经网络的轻量级攻击检测模型，以使每个本地系统能够进行高效的推论。最后，我们在实际智能电网数据集上评估了所提出的FedDiSC框架，并实验结果证明了其在隐私保护、计算效率和网络攻击检测准确性方面的优越性。",
