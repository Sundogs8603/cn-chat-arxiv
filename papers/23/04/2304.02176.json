    "translated_abstract": "人工智能系统可能会对人们造成伤害。本研究通过责备的视角研究了个体对此类伤害的反应。在前人有人们归咎于AI系统的研究基础上，我们探究了几个因素对个体反应机器、设计师和用户的责备风险的影响。三项研究结果（N = 1,153）表明，在归咎于这些行为者的过程中存在差异。AI系统是否可解释并不影响人们将责备放在他们、他们的开发者和用户的身上。公平和有害的考虑增加了对设计师和用户的责备，但对AI系统的判断几乎没有任何影响。相反，决定人们对机器的反应态度的是人们认为将责备他们作为对算法伤害的合适反应。我们讨论了一些含义，例如未来关于将AI系统纳入社会和道德范畴的决策将如何塑造普通人对AI的反应。",
    "tldr": "本篇论文探究了人们对算法伤害的反应，发现人们对机器、设计师和用户的责备分配有所不同，并且人们对机器发起责备的决策取决于他们是否认为这是一个合适的反应。",
