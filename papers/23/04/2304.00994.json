    "abstract": "We introduce a machine-learning-based tool for the Lean proof assistant that suggests relevant premises for theorems being proved by a user. The design principles for the tool are (1) tight integration with the proof assistant, (2) ease of use and installation, (3) a lightweight and fast approach. For this purpose, we designed a custom version of the random forest model, trained in an online fashion. It is implemented directly in Lean, which was possible thanks to the rich and efficient metaprogramming features of Lean 4. The random forest is trained on data extracted from mathlib -- Lean's mathematics library. We experiment with various options for producing training features and labels. The advice from a trained model is accessible to the user via the suggest_premises tactic which can be called in an editor while constructing a proof interactively.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种基于机器学习的工具，可为 Lean 证明助手建议与用户正在证明的定理相关的前提条件。该工具的设计原则为：（1）与证明助手紧密集成，（2）易于使用和安装，（3）采用轻量级且快速的方法。为此，我们设计了一个在线学习的自定义随机森林模型，直接在 Lean 中实现，这得益于 Lean 4 丰富而高效的元编程功能。随机森林的训练数据来自于 mathlib -- Lean 的数学库。我们尝试了各种选项来产生训练特征和标签。经过训练的模型的建议可以通过“suggest_premises策略”传达给用户，在交互式构建证明过程中可以在编辑器中调用该策略。",
