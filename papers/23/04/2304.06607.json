    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络模型是模型所有者的有价值知识产权，构成了竞争优势。因此，开发保护模型不被盗用的技术至关重要。模型所有权解决方案（MOR）是一类可以防止模型被盗的技术。MOR方案使得原告方可以通过提供证据（如水印或指纹）来断言对涉嫌盗用模型的被告方声称所有权，证明涉嫌模型是被盗或者源自于原告方拥有的源模型。现有的大多数 MOR 方案重点放在防范恶意涉嫌方方面，确保如果涉嫌模型确实是被盗版，则原告方将获胜。但是在本文中，我们揭示了现有文献中的常见 MOR 方案存在着另一个同等重要但尚未被充分探讨的鲁棒性问题：恶意原告。我们展示了如何成功地针对未被盗用的独立模型提出虚假指控。",
