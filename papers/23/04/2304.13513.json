    "abstract": "The domain shift in pathological segmentation is an important problem, where a network trained by a source domain (collected at a specific hospital) does not work well in the target domain (from different hospitals) due to the different image features. Due to the problems of class imbalance and different class prior of pathology, typical unsupervised domain adaptation methods do not work well by aligning the distribution of source domain and target domain. In this paper, we propose a cluster entropy for selecting an effective whole slide image (WSI) that is used for semi-supervised domain adaptation. This approach can measure how the image features of the WSI cover the entire distribution of the target domain by calculating the entropy of each cluster and can significantly improve the performance of domain adaptation. Our approach achieved competitive results against the prior arts on datasets collected from two hospitals.",

    "translated_abstract": "病理图像分割中的域偏移是一个重要问题，源域（在特定医院收集的图像）训练的网络在目标域（来自不同医院）中由于不同的图像特征表现不佳。由于病理学中的类别不平衡和不同类别先验分布的问题，典型的无监督域自适应方法不能通过对齐源域和目标域的分布来很好地处理该问题。本文提出了一种簇熵方法，用于选择用于半监督域自适应的有效WSI，该方法可以通过计算每个簇的熵来度量WSI的图像特征如何覆盖目标域的整个分布，并可以显著提高域自适应的性能。我们的方法在来自两家医院的数据集上取得了竞争性的结果。",
