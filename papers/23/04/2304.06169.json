To solve this problem and to synthesize interception trajectories, neural network methods of unsupervised learning based on the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm are used. The analysis of the obtained control laws and interception trajectories in comparison with the analytical solutions of the interception problem is performed. The mathematical modeling for the parameters of the target movement that the neural network had not seen before during training is carried out.
