    "translated_abstract": "本文提出使用深度神经网络从越南法律问题中提取重要信息的方法，这是构建法律领域问答系统的基本任务。给定一个自然语言的法律问题，目标是提取包含回答问题所需信息的所有片段。我们引入了一个三阶段的深度模型来解决这个任务。首先，我们利用最近的自编码语言模型生成上下文词嵌入，然后结合字符级和POS-tag信息形成单词表示。接下来，我们采用双向长短时记忆网络来捕捉单词之间的关系并生成句子表示。在第三阶段，我们借鉴了基于图的依存分析方法的思想，该方法提供了对输入句子的全局视图，使用双仿射分类器估计每个起始-结束单词对成为重要片段的概率。在一个新构建的越南法律问题数据集上的实验结果表明，我们提出的模型大幅优于强基线。",
