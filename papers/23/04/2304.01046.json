    "abstract": "Throughout schooling, students are tested on reading comprehension and logical reasoning. Students have developed various strategies for completing such exams, some of which are generally thought to outperform others. One such strategy involves emphasizing relative accuracy over absolute accuracy and can theoretically produce the correct answer without full knowledge of the information required to solve the question. This paper examines the effectiveness of applying such a strategy to train transfer learning models to solve reading comprehension and logical reasoning questions. The models were evaluated on the ReClor dataset, a challenging reading comprehension and logical reasoning benchmark. While previous studies targeted logical reasoning skills, we focus on a general training method and model architecture. We propose the polytuplet loss function, an extension of the triplet loss function, to ensure prioritization of learning the relative correctness of answer choices over learning",

    "translated_abstract": "在整个学校教育过程中，学生们将受到阅读理解和逻辑推理的考验。学生们已经开发了各种策略来完成此类考试，其中有些被认为是通常表现优于其他策略的。这样一种策略涉及强调相对准确性而非绝对准确性，理论上可以在不完全掌握解题所需信息的情况下得出正确答案。本文研究了应用这种策略来训练迁移学习模型以解决阅读理解和逻辑推理问题的有效性。这些模型在具有挑战性的阅读理解和逻辑推理基准数据集ReClor上进行了评估。尽管以前的研究集中于逻辑推理技能，但我们专注于一种通用的训练方法和模型架构。我们提出了Polytuplet Loss函数，是三元组损失函数的扩展，以确保优先学习答案选择的相对正确性而非学习绝对正确性。",
