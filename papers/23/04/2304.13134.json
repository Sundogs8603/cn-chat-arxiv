With an emphasis on flexibility, ease-of-use, and scalability, LAST implements differentiable weighted finite state automaton (WFSA) algorithms needed for training \\& inference that scale to a large WFSA such as a recognition lattice over the entire utterance. Despite these WFSA algorithms being well-known in the literature, new challenges arise from performance characteristics of modern architectures, and from nuances in automatic differentiation. We describe a suite of generally applicable techniques employed in LAST to address these challenges, and demonstrate their effectiveness with benchmarks on TPUv3 and V100 GPU.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一个名为LAST的库，它是基于格模型的语音转录器。LAST强调了灵活性、易用性和可扩展性，并实现了训练和推断所需的可微加权有限状态自动机（WFSA）算法，这些算法可以扩展到整个话语的识别格上。尽管这些WFSA算法在文献中已经被广泛应用，但是现代架构的性能特征和自动微分中的细微差别新的挑战已经出现。我们描述了用于解决这些挑战的一系列通用技术，并通过TPUv3和V100 GPU上的基准测试展示了它们的有效性。",
