    "abstract": "The increase in abusive content on online social media platforms is impacting the social life of online users. Use of offensive and hate speech has been making so-cial media toxic. Homophobia and transphobia constitute offensive comments against LGBT+ community. It becomes imperative to detect and handle these comments, to timely flag or issue a warning to users indulging in such behaviour. However, automated detection of such content is a challenging task, more so in Dravidian languages which are identified as low resource languages. Motivated by this, the paper attempts to explore applicability of different deep learning mod-els for classification of the social media comments in Malayalam and Tamil lan-guages as homophobic, transphobic and non-anti-LGBT+content. The popularly used deep learning models- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) using GloVe embedding and transformer-based learning models (Multilingual BERT and IndicBERT) are applied to the class",

    "translated_abstract": "在线社交媒体平台上辱骂性内容的增加正在影响在线用户的社交生活。使用冒犯和仇恨言论使得社交媒体变得有毒。恐同和跨性别歧视是针对LGBT+社群的冒犯性评论。及时检测和处理这些评论，向涉及此类行为的用户发出警告或及时标记是非常必要的。然而，在德拉维达语这种被认为是低资源语言的语言中，自动检测此类内容是一个具有挑战性的任务。因此，本文试图探讨不同深度学习模型在马来语和泰米尔语社交媒体评论分类中的适用性，以便将其识别为恐同、跨性别歧视和非反LGBT+内容。而其中应用的深度学习模型有卷积神经网络（CNN）、在GloVe嵌入下使用长短期记忆（LSTM）和基于变压器的学习模型（多语言BERT和IndicBERT）。",
