    "translated_abstract": "城市物流的发展日益复杂，尤其是城市人口的快速增长，使得利益相关者面临动态复杂的城市物流系统挑战，这些系统特点包括不确定性效应和货车排放污染。本文提出了一种研究城市物流系统环境可持续性的方法论，可通过在非混沌状态下有效利益相关者合作以及假设人的轻率倾向来实现。我们提出了不确定性效应的数学公理，并提出了条件影响因子及其如何分配假设值的概念。最后，我们采用蜘蛛网和因果回路图来研究系统元素及其随时间变化的行为。",

The approach involves effective collaboration among stakeholders and assuming the human tendency towards levity in non-chaotic scenarios. The paper introduces mathematical axioms to account for uncertainty effects, as well as the concept of condition effectors and assigned hypothetical values. Finally, a spider network and causal loop diagram are employed to investigate system elements and changes over time."
