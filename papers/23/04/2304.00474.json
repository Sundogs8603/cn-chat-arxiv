    "translated_abstract": "在基于图的机器学习领域，从部分观测数据中学习出平滑的图信号是一个研究已久的任务。本文从最优恢复的角度考虑这个任务，这是从实际观测数据中学习函数的一种数学方法，它采用了与要学习的函数模型有关的最坏情形观点。先前的最优恢复研究表明，最小化正则化目标在一般问题类别上产生最优解，但未完全确定正则化参数。我们的主要贡献在于提供了一种方法来计算正则化参数，这些参数对于图信号处理问题是最优的或接近最优的（取决于设置）。我们的结果为基于图的学习中的经典优化技术提供了新的解释，并用于超参数选择的新见解。我们在几个半合成数值实验中展示了我们方法的潜力。",
