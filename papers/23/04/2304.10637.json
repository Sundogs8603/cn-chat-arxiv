    "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a core natural language processing task in which pre-trained language models have shown remarkable performance. However, standard benchmarks like CoNLL 2003 \\cite{conll03} do not address many of the challenges that deployed NER systems face, such as having to classify emerging or complex entities in a fine-grained way. In this paper we present a novel NER cascade approach comprising three steps: first, identifying candidate entities in the input sentence; second, linking the each candidate to an existing knowledge base; third, predicting the fine-grained category for each entity candidate. We empirically demonstrate the significance of external knowledge bases in accurately classifying fine-grained and emerging entities. Our system exhibits robust performance in the MultiCoNER2 \\cite{multiconer2-data} shared task, even in the low-resource language setting where we leverage knowledge bases of high-resource languages.",

    "translated_abstract": "命名实体识别(NER)是一项核心的自然语言处理任务，在这方面，预训练的语言模型表现出了卓越的性能。然而，像CoNLL 2003等标准基准并没有解决部署NER系统需要面对的许多挑战，例如需要以细粒度的方式对新兴或复杂实体进行分类。本文提出了一种新颖的NER级联方法，包括三个步骤：首先，识别输入句子中的实体候选项；其次，将每个候选项链接到现有的知识库；第三，预测每个实体候选项的细粒度类别。我们通过实验证明了外部知识库在准确分类细粒度和新兴实体方面的重要性。我们的系统在MultiCoNER2共享任务中表现出了鲁棒性能，即使在低资源语言环境中，我们也能利用高资源语言的知识库。",
