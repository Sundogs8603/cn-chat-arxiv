    "translated_abstract": "真实世界中的对抗性物理补丁已经成功地在各种计算机视觉应用中破坏了最先进的模型。现有的基于梯度或特征分析的防御已经被最近的基于GAN的攻击所破坏，这些攻击生成了自然主义的补丁。在本文中，我们提出了Jedi，一种新的针对对抗性补丁的防御方法，该方法对真实的补丁攻击具有弹性。Jedi从信息论的角度解决了补丁定位问题；利用了两个新想法：(1) 它通过熵分析改进了潜在补丁区域的识别：我们证明了对抗性补丁的熵是高的，即使在自然主义的补丁中也是如此；(2) 它利用能够从高熵内核中完成补丁区域的自动编码器，来改善对抗性补丁的定位。Jedi实现了高精度的对抗性补丁定位，我们证明这对于成功修复图像至关重要。由于Jedi是针对补丁特定的，并不需要先前关于对抗攻击方法的先验知识，因此它提供了一种针对对抗性补丁的通用防御。",
