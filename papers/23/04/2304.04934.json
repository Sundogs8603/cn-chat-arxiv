    "translated_abstract": "最近的数据管制要求机器反学习（MU）：从模型中移除指定样例的影响。虽然可以通过使用剩余数据从头开始进行模型重新训练来进行精确反学习，但是其计算成本导致了近似但高效的反学习方案的开发。除了数据中心的MU解决方案，我们通过一种新颖的基于模型的视角推进MU：通过权值修剪进行稀疏化。我们的理论和实践结果表明，模型稀疏性可以提高近似反学习器的多标准反学习性能，缩小近似间隙，同时保持高效。有了这个认识，我们制定了两个新的稀疏感知反学习元方案，称为“先修剪，然后反学习”和“稀疏感知反学习”。广泛的实验表明，我们的发现和提议在各种场景下始终有益于MU，包括按类数据擦除、随机数据擦除和后门数据伪造等。",
