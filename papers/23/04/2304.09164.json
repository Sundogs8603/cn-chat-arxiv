    "translated_abstract": "医学图像领域中的域偏移是一个普遍存在的问题，这可能会严重影响分割模型处理未见过的图像域时的性能。基于对抗的深度学习模型（例如 Cycle-GAN）已成为处理医学图像无监督域适应的常见模型。然而，这些模型在转换医学扫描时没有强制执行感兴趣结构的保留能力，这可能导致分割的无监督域适应结果较差。本文引入了一种结构保持循环GAN（SP Cycle-GAN），通过在整个循环GAN训练过程中执行分割损失项，促进医学结构在图像转换过程中的保持。我们通过视觉和对无监督域适应模型的 Dice 指标分割性能比较展示了 SP Cycle-GAN 的结构保持能力。相较于传统的 Cycle-GAN 模型，SP Cycle-GAN 在未见过的图像域上实现了更好的分割性能。",
