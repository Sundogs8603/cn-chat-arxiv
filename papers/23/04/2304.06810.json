    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖、受物理约束和可微分的方法，通过量子光学中的自发参量下转换 (SPDC)，生成 D 维 qudit 状态。我们规避了物理过程固有的随机性所带来的任何限制，并并入了一组随机动力学方程，控制其在 SPDC 哈密顿下的演化。我们通过设计结构化的非线性光子晶体 (NLPCs) 和形状化的泵浦光束，展示了我们模型的有效性；理论上和实验上展示了如何在空间自由度中生成最大纠缠态。学习 NLPC 结构为塑造和控制任意量子态提供了有前途的新途径，并且使得生成态的全光学相干控制成为可能。我们相信这种方法可以很容易地从庞大的晶体扩展到薄型元表面，并且可能应用于其他共享类似哈密顿量的量子系统。",
