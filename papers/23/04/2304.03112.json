    "translated_abstract": "个性化新闻推荐的出现使得推荐体系结构变得越来越复杂。大多数神经新闻推荐器依赖于用户点击行为，通常引入专门的用户编码器将点击新闻内容聚合成用户嵌入（早期融合）。这些模型主要通过标准的逐点分类目标进行训练。现有的工作存在两个主要缺点：（1）尽管设计普遍相同，但由于评估数据集和协议的不同，模型之间的直接比较受到了阻碍; （2）留给了替代的模型设计和训练目标大量的未开发空间。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新闻推荐的统一框架，允许在几个关键设计维度上系统地和公平地比较新闻推荐器: （i）候选人感知用户建模，（ii）点击行为融合，和（iii）培训目标。我们的发现挑战了神经新闻推荐的现状，并突显了我们提出的框架的有效性，它使用非常简化的模型设计和训练目标实现了竞争性的结果。",
