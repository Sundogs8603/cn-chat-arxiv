    "translated_abstract": "信息瓶颈（IB）通过信息压缩学习表示，从而推广到未见过的数据。然而，由于虚无的推广边界，现有的IB在实际场景中无法保证推广性。最近的PAC-Bayes IB使用信息复杂度而不是信息压缩来建立与相互信息推广界限的联系。然而，它需要计算昂贵的二阶曲率，阻碍了其实际应用。本文建立了表示的可识别性与近期的函数条件互信息（f-CMI）推广边界之间的联系，该边界的估计要简单得多。在此基础上，我们提出了一种可识别信息瓶颈（RIB），通过基于Bregman散度下的密度比匹配优化的可识别性评论家来规范表示的可识别性。在多个标准数据集上进行了广泛实验验证。",
