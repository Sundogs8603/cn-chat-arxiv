    "translated_abstract": "高性能计算架构中的异构性和可配置性不断增长，使得在这些系统上进行自动调优和运行时参数配置变得非常复杂。为了缩短达到最佳配置的时间，除了采用面向特定应用的解决方案外，常见的方法是使用通用搜索策略，但往往不能找到最佳的配置或其收敛所需时间太长。因此，需要一种通用且高效的调优方法，可轻松扩展和适应多种调优任务。本文提出了一种调节并行代码区域的技术，其足够通用，可适应于多个任务。我们分析基于IR的编程模型，以进行特定任务的性能优化。为此，我们提出了基于多模态深度学习的多模态图神经网络和自编码器（MGA）调谐器，该方法使用异构图神经网络和去噪自编码器。",
