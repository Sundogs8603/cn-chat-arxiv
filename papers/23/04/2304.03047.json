    "translated_abstract": "视觉语言导航需要智能体遵循指示在环境中导航，该任务在体验式人工智能领域中具有潜在应用，如自治导航、搜索与救援和人机交互。本文提出了一个更为实用但具有挑战性的情景 - 在连续环境中进行视觉语言导航（VLN-CE）。为了开发一个强大的VLN-CE代理，我们提出了一个新的导航框架ETPNav，它专注于两个关键技能：1）抽象环境和生成长程导航计划的能力；和2）在连续环境中避障控制的能力。ETPNav通过自组织沿着经过的路径预测的路标进行在线环境拓扑映射，而不需要先前的环境经验。它将导航过程分解为高层规划和低层控制。同时，ETPNav使用一种新颖的演化算法来优化拓扑规划模块，以实现有效的长期导航计划。所提出的方法在Matterport3D模拟器上实现了最先进的性能，并在任意起点和终点的VLN-CE任务中达到了人类水平的性能。",

ETPNav achieves state-of-the-art performance with an evolutionary algorithm optimized topological planning module on the Matterport3D simulator, and reaches human-level performance on VLN-CE tasks with arbitrary start and end positions."
