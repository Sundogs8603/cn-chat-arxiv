    "abstract": "We present the Radar de Parit\\'e, an automated Natural Language Processing (NLP) system that measures the proportion of women and men quoted daily in six Canadian French-language media outlets. We outline the system's architecture and detail the challenges we overcame to address French-specific issues, in particular regarding coreference resolution, a new contribution to the NLP literature on French. We also showcase statistics covering over one year's worth of data (282,512 news articles). Our results highlight the underrepresentation of women in news stories, while also illustrating the application of modern NLP methods to measure gender representation and address societal issues.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了Radar de Parit\\'e，这是一个自动化的自然语言处理（NLP）系统，用于衡量六个加拿大法语媒体中每日引用的女性和男性的比例。我们概述了该系统的架构，并详细介绍了我们克服的法语特定问题，特别是关于coreference resolution的问题，这是法语NLP文献的新贡献。我们还展示了超过一年的数据统计（282,512篇新闻文章）。我们的结果突出了新闻报道中女性的代表性不足，同时也展示了运用现代NLP方法来衡量性别代表性和解决社会问题的应用。",

The system's architecture and French-specific coreference resolution are detailed, and statistics spanning over a year's worth of news articles show the underrepresentation of women in news stories. The application of modern NLP methods to address societal issues is highlighted."
