    "abstract": "Similar Case Matching (SCM) is designed to determine whether two cases are similar.

Therefore, this paper proposes a pipeline framework for interpretable SCM, which consists of four modules: a judicial feature sentence identification module, a case matching module, a feature sentence alignment module, and a conflict disambiguation module. Unlike existing SCM methods, our framework will identify feature sentences in a case that contain essential information, perform similar case matching based on the extracted feature sentence results, and align the feature sentences in the two cases to provide evidence for the similarity of the cases. SCM results may conflict with feature sentence alignment results, and our framework further disambiguate",

    "translated_abstract": "相似案例匹配（SCM）旨在确定两个案件是否相似。该任务在法律系统中具有重要的作用，帮助法律专业人员快速找到相关案例，从而更有效地处理它们。现有研究集中在提高模型的性能上，而不是在其可解释性上。因此，本文提出了一个可解释的SCM管道框架，包括四个模块：司法特征句子识别模块、案例匹配模块、特征句子对齐模块和冲突消歧模块。与现有的SCM方法不同，我们的框架将识别包含基本信息的案例特征句，基于提取的特征句结果进行相似案例匹配，并对两个案例中的特征句进行对齐，以提供证据支持案例的相似性。SCM结果可能与特征句对齐结果产生冲突，因此我们的框架进一步消歧。",
