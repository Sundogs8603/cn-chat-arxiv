    "translated_abstract": "新闻推荐旨在基于用户行为预测点击行为。如何有效地建模用户表示是推荐首选新闻的关键。现有方法大多集中在监督微调阶段的改进上。然而，还缺乏针对用户表示优化的基于PLM的无监督预训练方法。在本文中，我们提出了一种具有两个任务的无监督预训练范例，即用户行为掩蔽和用户行为生成，均致力于有效的用户行为建模。首先，我们引入了用户行为掩蔽预训练任务，以恢复基于上下文行为的掩蔽用户行为。通过这种方式，模型可以捕捉到更强大、更全面的用户新闻阅读模式。此外，我们还结合了一种新颖的辅助用户行为生成预训练任务，以增强从用户编码器派生出的用户表示向量。我们使用上述预训练的用户建模来进行新闻推荐，实验结果表明，我们的模型在多个数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。",
