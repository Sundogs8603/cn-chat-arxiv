    "abstract": "Search engines are vulnerable to attacks against indexing and searching via text encoding manipulation. By imperceptibly perturbing text using uncommon encoded representations, adversaries can control results across search engines for specific search queries. We demonstrate that this attack is successful against two major commercial search engines - Google and Bing - and one open source search engine - Elasticsearch. We further demonstrate that this attack is successful against LLM chat search including Bing's GPT-4 chatbot and Google's Bard chatbot. We also present a variant of the attack targeting text summarization and plagiarism detection models, two ML tasks closely tied to search. We provide a set of defenses against these techniques and warn that adversaries can leverage these attacks to launch disinformation campaigns against unsuspecting users, motivating the need for search engine maintainers to patch deployed systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "搜索引擎对于文本编码操纵的索引和搜索存在漏洞。通过以不常见的编码表示形式微不可见地扭曲文本，攻击者可以控制特定搜索查询在多个搜索引擎上的结果。我们演示了这种攻击成功地针对了两个主要的商业搜索引擎——Google和Bing——以及一个开源搜索引擎——Elasticsearch。我们进一步展示了这种攻击成功地针对了包括Bing的GPT-4聊天机器人和Google的Bard聊天机器人在内的LLM聊天搜索。我们还提出了一种变体攻击，针对与搜索密切相关的两个ML任务——文本摘要和抄袭检测模型。我们提供了一套针对这些技术的防御措施，并警告攻击者可以利用这些攻击启动反信息争夺战。这促使搜索引擎维护人员修补已部署的系统。",

This technique is successful against major commercial search engines including Google and Bing, open source search engine Elasticsearch, and even chatbot search algorithms. Defenses are needed to avoid malicious campaigns and protect search accuracy."
