    "abstract": "This report presents a study on the emotional dialogue capability of ChatGPT, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. The study evaluates the performance of ChatGPT on emotional dialogue understanding and generation through a series of experiments on several downstream tasks. Our findings indicate that while ChatGPT's performance on emotional dialogue understanding may still lag behind that of supervised models, it exhibits promising results in generating emotional responses. Furthermore, the study suggests potential avenues for future research directions.",
