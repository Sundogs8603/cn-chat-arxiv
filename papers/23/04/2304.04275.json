    "abstract": "Missing data in time series is a challenging issue affecting time series analysis. Missing data occurs due to problems like data drops or sensor malfunctioning. Imputation methods are used to fill in these values, with quality of imputation having a significant impact on downstream tasks like classification. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised imputation method, ST-Impute, that uses both unlabeled data along with downstream task's labeled data. ST-Impute is based on sparse self-attention and trains on tasks that mimic the imputation process. Our results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the existing supervised and unsupervised time series imputation methods measured on the imputation quality as well as on the downstream tasks ingesting imputed time series.",

    "translated_abstract": "时间序列中的缺失数据是影响时间序列分析的一个具有挑战性的问题。由于数据丢失或传感器故障等问题导致缺失数据的发生。插补方法用于填补这些值，而插补的质量对下游任务（如分类）的影响很大。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种半监督插补方法ST-Impute，该方法利用未标记数据以及下游任务的标记数据。ST-Impute基于稀疏自我关注，并训练类似于插补过程的任务。我们的结果表明，提出的方法在插补质量以及插补时间序列的下游任务方面优于现有的监督和无监督时间序列插补方法。",
