    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一个新型的驾驶员认知负荷评估数据集CL-Drive。该数据集包括驾驶时的脑电图（EEG）信号、心电图（ECG）、皮肤电活动（EDA）信号以及眼动追踪数据。数据采集自21名被试在沉浸式车辆模拟器中驾驶，包括不同驾驶条件下的任务，以诱发被试的不同认知负荷水平，每个任务持续3分钟，共9个复杂度级别。每个驾驶员在实验过程中每10秒报告一次主观认知负荷。数据集中包含主观认知负荷记录作为基准。此外，本文还提供了不同机器学习和深度学习模型的二元和三元标签分布的基准分类结果。我们采用了两种评估标准，即10倍交叉验证和留一法。我们对手工制作的特征和原始信号进行了训练。结果表明，使用多模态生理信号与眼动追踪数据相比仅使用EEG数据具有更好的分类性能。我们的数据集和分类结果为进一步研究驾驶员认知负荷评估提供了基准。",
