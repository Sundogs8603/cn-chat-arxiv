    "abstract": "Financial market participants frequently rely on numerous business relationships to make investment decisions. Investors can learn about potential risks and opportunities associated with other connected entities through these corporate connections. Nonetheless, human annotation of a large corpus to extract such relationships is highly time-consuming, not to mention that it requires a considerable amount of industry expertise and professional training. Meanwhile, we have yet to observe means to generate reliable knowledge graphs of corporate relationships due to the lack of impartial and granular data sources. This study proposes a system to process financial reports and construct the public competitor graph to fill the void.

    "translated_abstract": "金融市场参与者通常依赖于诸多商业关系来做出投资决策。投资者能够通过这些公司关联关系了解其他连接实体所涉及的潜在风险和机遇。然而，人工标注一大批语料来提取这样的关系非常耗时，更不用说需要相当数量的行业专业知识和专业训练。同时，由于缺乏公正和细粒度的数据来源，我们尚未观察到生成可靠的企业关系知识图谱的手段。本研究提出了一个系统来处理财务报告，并构建公共竞争关系图以填补空缺。我们的方法能够检索到标普500指数公司83％以上的竞争关系。基于我们系统的输出，我们构建了具有700个节点和1200个边的知识图谱，并提供了一个交互式的演示图形界面。",
