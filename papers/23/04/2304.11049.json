    "abstract": "Hallucination is an apparent perception in the absence of real external sensory stimuli. An auditory hallucination is a perception of hearing sounds that are not real. A common form of auditory hallucination is hearing voices in the absence of any speakers which is known as Auditory Verbal Hallucination (AVH). AVH is fragments of the mind's creation that mostly occur in people diagnosed with mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Assessing the valence of hallucinated voices (i.e., how negative or positive voices are) can help measure the severity of a mental illness. We study N=435 individuals, who experience hearing voices, to assess auditory verbal hallucination. Participants report the valence of voices they hear four times a day for a month through ecological momentary assessments with questions that have four answering scales from ``not at all'' to ``extremely''. We collect these self-reports as the valence supervision of AVH events via a mobile application. ",

    "translated_abstract": "幻觉是一种在实际外部感官刺激缺失时出现的想象感知。听觉幻觉是一种听到虚假声音的感知。听觉性幻觉是一种常见形式的听觉幻觉，指在没有任何说话者的情况下听到声音，通常出现在被诊断患有双相情感障碍和精神分裂症等精神疾病的人们中。评估幻听声音的情感色彩（即声音是负面的还是正面的）可以帮助测量精神疾病的严重程度。我们研究了435名体验幻听的个体，以评估听觉性幻觉。参与者通过一个移动应用程序，每天四次通过生态时刻评估回答四个答案等级的问题，向我们报告他们听到的声音的情感色彩，从“完全没有”到“极其”。我们将这些自我报告作为AVH事件的情感监督来收集。",
