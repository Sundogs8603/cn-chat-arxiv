    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型为设计和开发新的AI辅助写作工具带来了令人兴奋的机遇和挑战。最近的研究表明，利用这一新技术可以在许多情况下改变写作，如创意写作中的构思、编辑支持和摘要。然而，AI支持的说明性写作，包括学者撰写文献综述或医生撰写进展报告等现实任务，相对不够研究。在这篇立场论文中，我们认为为说明性写作开发AI支持具有独特和令人兴奋的研究挑战，可以带来高度的实际影响。我们将说明性写作描述为基于证据和生成知识的：它包含外部文档的总结以及新信息或知识。它可以被看作是作者在一组源文件上进行意义构建过程的产物，阅读、思考和写作之间的相互作用开启了新的机遇。",
