    "translated_abstract": "“语义”和“本体论”这两个词越来越与“解释”一起出现，不仅在科学文献中，而且在组织交流中也频繁出现。然而，所有这些术语都被大量超载。在本文中，我们讨论它们之间的强关联性，特别是我们讨论了一种解释概念，称为本体拆包，旨在通过揭示其假定的真相制造者——即使那些描述中的命题为真的本体论实体，来解释符号领域描述（概念模型、知识图和逻辑规范）。为了说明这个想法，我们采用了关系的本体论理论，通过揭示标准建模语言UML中编码的非常简单的符号模型的隐藏语义来解释它。我们还讨论了由本形式的解释造成的本体论驱动的概念模型，以及它们在各种形式的基于AI的决策制定中所发挥的关键作用。",
