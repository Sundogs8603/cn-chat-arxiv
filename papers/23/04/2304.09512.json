    "translated_abstract": "随着社交网络的兴起，社区检测成为了一个重要的问题。虽然均值漂移是一种出色的聚类算法，但由于均值漂移算法只能处理具有坐标的数据，而社区检测问题中的数据大多以图的形式表示，可以视为具有距离矩阵（或相似度矩阵）的数据，因此均值漂移算法不能直接用于社区检测。幸运的是，提出了一种新的聚类算法 Medoid-Shift，该算法保留了均值漂移的优点，并可以应用于基于距离矩阵的问题，如社区检测。Medoid-Shift算法的一个缺点是可能在由距离参数定义的邻域区域内没有数据点。 为了更好地处理社区检测问题，因此在本文中提出了一种名为修正Medoid-Shift（RMS）的新算法。 在寻找下一个中心点的过程中，RMS算法基于邻域的定义。",
