    "abstract": "The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend of many colleges moving to test-optional, and in some cases test-blind, admissions policies. A frequent claim is that by not seeing standardized test scores, a college is able to admit a student body that it prefers, such as one with more diversity. But how can observing less information allow a college to improve its decisions? We argue that test-optional policies may be driven by social pressure on colleges' admission decisions. We propose a model of college admissions in which a college disagrees with society on which students should be admitted. We show how the college can use a test-optional policy to reduce its \"disagreement cost\" with society, regardless of whether this results in a preferred student pool. We discuss which students either benefit from or are harmed by a test-optional policy. In an application, we study how a ban on using race in admissions may result in more colleges going test optional or test blind.",

    "translated_abstract": "Covid-19疫情加速了许多大学转向测试自选或测试盲选的趋势。一种经常出现的说法是，通过不考虑标准化考试分数，学院可以录取它更喜欢的学生群体，比如更多元化的学生群体。但是，观察更少的信息如何能让大学提高其决策能力呢？我们认为，测试自选政策可能受到了对大学录取决策的社会压力的推动。我们提出了一个大学入学模型，其中大学在哪些学生应该被录取方面与社会存在分歧。我们展示了大学如何使用测试自选政策来减少其与社会的“分歧成本”，而不论这是否导致了一个更受欢迎的学生队伍。我们讨论了哪些学生受益于测试自选政策，哪些学生会受到损害。在一项应用中，我们研究了禁止在入学中使用种族因素可能会导致更多的学校转向测试自选或测试盲选。",
