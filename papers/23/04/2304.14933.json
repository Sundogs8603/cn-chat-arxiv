    "translated_abstract": "模型融合（例如插值或任务算术）将在不同任务上训练的多个模型合并以生成多任务解决方案。该技术在先前的研究中已经被证明成功，其中模型是在相似的任务和相同的初始化下训练的。在本文中，我们通过将在不同模态上训练的transformer进行融合，将此概念扩展到多模态设置。此外，我们针对一个新颖的目标进行研究，在该目标中，我们可以将视觉、语言和跨模态的transformer合并到特定模态的架构中，以创建一个参数有效的模态不可知架构。通过全面的实验，我们系统地研究了影响模型融合后性能的关键因素，包括初始化、融合机制和模型架构。我们的分析得出了一个有效的训练配方，可以通过模型融合来匹配模态不可知基线的性能（即从头开始预训练）。我们的代码可供使用。",
