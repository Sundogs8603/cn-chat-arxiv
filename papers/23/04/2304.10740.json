    "translated_abstract": "了解信用评级分配中哪些因素是重要的可以帮助做出更好的决策。然而，目前文献的重点大多集中在结构化数据上，较少研究非结构化或多模态数据集。本文提出了一种分析结构化和非结构化不同类型数据集的深度学习模型融合的有效架构，以预测公司信用评级标准。在模型中，我们测试了不同的深度学习模型及融合策略的组合，包括CNN，LSTM，GRU和BERT。我们研究了数据融合策略（包括早期和中间融合）以及技术（包括串联和交叉注意）等方面。结果表明，一个基于CNN的多模态模型通过两种融合策略优于其他多模态技术。此外，通过比较简单的架构与更复杂的架构，我们发现，更复杂的模型并不一定能在信用评级预测中发挥更好的性能。",

Through comparing different fusion strategies and combinations of deep learning models, the study demonstrates that a CNN-based multi-modal model outperforms other multi-modal techniques using two fusion strategies. Additionally, it reveals that more sophisticated models do not necessarily lead to better performance in credit rating prediction."
