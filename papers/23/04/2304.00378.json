    "abstract": "The cascade of 2D geometric transformations were exploited to model relations between entities in a knowledge graph (KG), leading to an effective KG embedding (KGE) model, CompoundE. Furthermore, the rotation in the 3D space was proposed as a new KGE model, Rotate3D, by leveraging its non-commutative property. Inspired by CompoundE and Rotate3D, we leverage 3D compound geometric transformations, including translation, rotation, scaling, reflection, and shear and propose a family of KGE models, named CompoundE3D, in this work. CompoundE3D allows multiple design variants to match rich underlying characteristics of a KG. Since each variant has its own advantages on a subset of relations, an ensemble of multiple variants can yield superior performance. The effectiveness and flexibility of CompoundE3D are experimentally verified on four popular link prediction datasets.",
