    "translated_abstract": "我们地球上的生物多样性正面临威胁，预计近一百万物种将在几十年内灭绝。这是由于人类的负面行为，包括狩猎、过度捕捞、污染以及为城市化和农业目的而转化土地等。尽管慈善机构和政府在有益自然的活动上投入了大量的资金，全球野生动物种群仍然不断下降。当地的野生动物守护者历史上在全球保护工作中发挥了关键作用，并展示了他们在各个层次上实现可持续发展的能力。2021年，联合国气候变化大会（COP26）认可了他们的贡献，并承诺每年提供17亿美元。然而，考虑到他们保护了地球生物多样性的80％，这只是全球生物多样性预算（每年约1240亿至1430亿美元）中的一小部分。本文提出了一种基于“物种货币”的激进新解决方案，其中动物拥有自己的货币。通过为野生动物创建数字孪生体，可以使用深度学习算法分析数据来监督和保护它们。",
