    "translated_abstract": "手术阶段识别(SPR)是现代手术室数字化转型中至关重要的元素。虽然基于视频源的SPR已经很成熟，但插管X光序列的整合尚未被探索。本文提出了Pelphix，这是一种针对X光引导下的经皮盆骨折修复的SPR方法，该方法将该过程建模为四个粒度水平——走廊、活动、视图和帧值——将盆骨折修复工作流程模拟为马尔科夫过程，从而提供完全注释的训练数据。 使用从骨走廊、工具和解剖学检测中添加的监督学习，我们学习图像表示，并将其馈送到Transformer模型中，以在四个粒度级别上回归手术阶段。我们的方法展示了基于X光的SPR的可行性，在模拟序列中实现了93.8％的平均准确率，在尸体中实现了67.57％的所有粒度级别，并针对目标走廊的准确率高达88％。",
