    "abstract": "This work discusses the use of contrastive learning and deep learning for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases from electrocardiography (ECG) signals. While the ECG signals usually contain 12 leads (channels), many healthcare facilities and devices lack access to all these 12 leads. This raises the problem of how to use only fewer ECG leads to produce meaningful diagnoses with high performance. We introduce a simple experiment to test whether contrastive learning can be applied to this task. More specifically, we added the similarity between the embedding vectors when the 12 leads signal and the fewer leads ECG signal to the loss function to bring these representations closer together. Despite its simplicity, this has been shown to have improved the performance of diagnosing with all lead combinations, proving the potential of contrastive learning on this task.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了使用对比学习和深度学习来从心电图（ECG）信号中诊断心血管疾病的方法。虽然ECG信号通常包含12个导联（通道），但许多医疗设施和设备缺乏获取所有这些12个导联的能力。这就提出了如何仅使用更少的ECG导联来产生高性能的有意义诊断的问题。我们引入了一个简单的实验来测试对比学习是否可以应用于此任务。更具体地，我们将12个导联信号和较少的导联ECG信号的嵌入向量之间的相似度添加到损失函数中，使这些表示更加接近。尽管简单，但已经证明它可以提高使用所有导联组合进行诊断的性能，证明了对比学习在此任务中的潜力。",
