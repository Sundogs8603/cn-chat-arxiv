In this paper, we focus on a more general type of perturbation and introduce the topic-oriented adversarial ranking attack task against NRMs, which aims to find an imperceptible perturbation that can promote a target document in ranking for a group of queries with the same topic.

    "translated_abstract": "神经排名模型（NRMs）在信息检索中受到了极大的关注。但不幸的是，NRMs可能继承了一般神经网络的对抗性漏洞，这可能被黑帽搜索引擎优化从业者利用。最近，人们在配对攻击设置中探索了对NRMs的对抗攻击，为特定查询的目标文档生成对抗扰动。本文关注更通用类型的扰动，引入了针对NRMs的面向主题的对抗排名攻击任务，旨在找到一种无法察觉的扰动，可以在同一主题的一组查询中提高目标文档的排名。我们为任务定义了静态和动态设置，并专注于基于决策的黑盒攻击。我们提出了一种新的框架来改进基于主题的攻击性能，基于替代排名模型。攻击问题被形式化为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）。",
