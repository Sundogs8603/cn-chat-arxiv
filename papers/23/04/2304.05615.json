    "translated_abstract": "最近，多利益模型被用作提取用户多个表示向量的兴趣， 对于序列推荐表现良好。然而，目前存在的多兴趣推荐模型都没有考虑兴趣分布可能改变带来的跨领域泛化问题。考虑到用户多个兴趣通常高度相关，模型有机会学习到嘈杂兴趣和目标项之间的虚假相关性。数据分布发生变化，兴趣之间的相关性也会发生变化，虚假相关性会误导模型进行错误预测。为了解决上述跨领域泛化问题，我们提出了一个新的多利益网络，名为DESMIL，该网络试图在模型中去相关提取的利益，从而可以消除虚假的相关性。DESMIL应用一个注意力模块来提取多个利益，一个基于Transformer的编码器来对它们进行编码，一个去相关模块来去除相关性。在两个真实世界数据集上的实验证明了DESMIL在in-distribution和out-of-distribution方面都优于现有最先进的方法。",

By de-correlating the extracted multiple interests and eliminating spurious correlations, DESMIL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, as demonstrated in experiments on two real-world datasets."
