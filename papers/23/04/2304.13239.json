    "translated_abstract": "Andrews图提供了高维数据集的美观可视化。本工作证明了Andrews图（在使用数据集的主成分分值定义时）平均上是最优“平滑”的，并且在从欧几里得数据空间到$L^2([0,1])$的线性等距映射集合上解决了一个无限维度二次最小化程序。通过建立技术性机器对线性等距映射上的一般无限维二次最小化程序的解进行了表征，我们进一步证明了解集（在通常情况下）是一个流形。为了避免这个解集合中出现的模棱两可，我们在无限维优化程序中添加“谱平滑”项，以引导具有最优空间谱平滑效果的Andrews图。我们表征了该程序的（通常）解集，证明了结果图能够进行高效的数值逼近。这些空间谱平滑的Andrews图可用于高维数据集的有效计算。",
