Therefore, its feasibility for a real-world application cannot be assessed since this requires detecting relevant entities automatically. Second, they represent claim entities with the original tokens. This constitutes a terminology mismatch which potentially limits the fact-checking performance.

    "translated_abstract": "为了解决现有的生物医学声明事实检查模型通常是在合成或精细措辞的数据上进行训练并且很难转移到社交媒体内容的问题，Wuehrl＆Klinger（2022）提出了基于文本中的医学实体提取简洁的声明来模仿常见训练声明的专注性的做法。然而，他们的研究有两个限制：首先，它依赖于黄金注释实体。因此，无法评估其在现实世界应用中的可行性，因为这需要自动检测相关实体。第二，他们用原始标记表示声明实体。这构成了术语不匹配，可能限制了事实检查性能。为了理解这两个挑战，我们提出了一个用于医学推文的声明提取管道，该管道包括命名实体识别和通过实体链接的术语规范化。我们发现，自动NER确实会导致性能下降，但我们发现实体链接极大地提高了系统准确提取声明的能力，特别是在社交媒体文本上。我们提出的管道成功地从医学推文中提取了简明的基于实体的声明，在手动注释的测试集上获得了0.66的F1分数。",
