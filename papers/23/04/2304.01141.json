    "translated_abstract": "本文提供了关于无治疗效应异质性零假设的渐近有效测试。重要的是，作者考虑到异质性的存在，它是由未被观察到的特征或所谓的独特异质性引起的。在检查这种异质性时，常见的统计测试存在一个在平均处理效应中的扰动参数问题，因此，渐近分布依赖于该参数的估计。作者提出了一种通过使用经验特征函数避开估计该参数的渐近有效测试。通过模拟研究，不仅说明了这个测试的有效性，而且与目前的测试相比，在拒绝错误的零假设方面具有更高的功率。此外，作者通过将该方法应用于波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那的一项小额信贷实验来展示该方法的实用性。在这项实验中，针对与贷款申请和自雇有关的结果，测试表明治疗效应存在异质化。",
