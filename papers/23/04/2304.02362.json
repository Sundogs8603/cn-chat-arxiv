    "translated_abstract": "加密货币是通过使用密码学维护的去中心化系统的数字资产。在这个新兴数字市场中，投资者正在探索组合投资的盈利潜力而不是单一的加密货币。鉴于这个极度波动的市场中的价格预测是具有挑战性的，组合特别有用。加密货币市场是一个自组织的复杂系统，在其中加密货币之间的复杂相互依赖性可以被利用来理解市场动态并构建有效的组合。本文使用网络方法识别高度不相关的加密货币，以创建分散化的投资组合，并利用马科维兹组合理论在未来市场行为不确定的情况下进行投资组合优化。我们基于网络的投资组合的表现在46个加密货币中最优，优于基准，投资期限为14天，1天内平均预期收益率达到1066％，风险合理。我们还表明，流行的加密货币往往不是最理想的投资选择，具有较高的价格相关性。",
