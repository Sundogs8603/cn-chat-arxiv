    "translated_abstract": "传统上，数值模型在海洋学研究中被用来模拟海洋动力学，代表了物理方程。然而，许多与海洋动力学有关的因素似乎是不确定的。我们认为，将从观测数据中提取的物理知识转移可以进一步提高数值模型在预测海表温度（SST）时的准确性。最近，地球观测技术的进步产生了巨大的数据增长。因此，探索利用越来越多的历史观测数据来改进和补充数值模型的方法至关重要。为此，我们介绍了一种从历史观测数据中转移物理知识到数值模型的SST预测方法。具体而言，我们使用一个编码器和生成对抗网络（GAN）的组合来捕获从观测数据中提取的物理知识。然后，将数值模型数据馈入预训练模型以进行预测。",
