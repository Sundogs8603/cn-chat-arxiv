    "translated_abstract": "深度学习技术在科学中具有广泛应用，特别是在寻求简化潜在解决方案和发现的路径方面。然而，DL模型经常在模拟结果上进行训练，然后应用于真实实验数据。因此，模拟和真实数据之间的任何系统差异可能会降低模型的性能，这种效应称为“领域漂移”。本文研究了一种系统差异的玩具模型，提出了一种完全无监督的任务不可知方法来减少两个系统不同的样本之间的差异。该方法基于最近在成对图像转换技术上的进展，并在两组模拟液氩时间投影室（LArTPC）探测器事件样本上进行了验证，这些样本被创建以控制地演示在模拟和真实数据之间的常见系统差异。LArTPC探测器代表了下一代粒子探测器的发展方向。",
