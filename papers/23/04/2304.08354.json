    "translated_abstract": "人类拥有非凡的创造和利用工具的能力，使得他们能够克服物理限制并探索新的领域。随着基础模型的出现，AI系统有望像人类一样熟练地使用工具。这种范式即基于基础模型的工具学习，结合了专用工具和基础模型的优势，实现了问题解决的增强精度、效率和自动化。尽管具有巨大潜力，但该领域仍缺乏对关键挑战、机会和未来发展的全面理解。针对这一问题，本文对工具学习进行了系统研究。首先介绍了工具学习的背景，包括其认知起源、基础模型的范式转换和工具和模型的互补作用。然后，我们回顾了现有的工具学习研究，包括基于工具和面向工具的学习。我们制定了一个涵盖两种类型学习的通用工具学习框架，并分析了它们的独特挑战、机会和未来方向。我们预计这种系统的探索将为未来开发具有复杂工具学习能力的AI系统提供一个跳板。",
