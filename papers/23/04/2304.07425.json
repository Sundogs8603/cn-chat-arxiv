    "abstract": "A prevalent limitation of optimizing over a single objective is that it can be misguided, becoming trapped in local optimum. This can be rectified by Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, where a population of high-quality and diverse solutions to a problem is preferred. Most conventional QD approaches, for example, MAP-Elites, explicitly manage a behavioral archive where solutions are broken down into predefined niches. In this work, we show that a diverse population of solutions can be found without the limitation of needing an archive or defining the range of behaviors in advance. Instead, we break down solutions into independently evolving species and use unsupervised skill discovery to learn diverse, high-performing solutions. We show that this can be done through gradient-based mutations that take on an information theoretic perspective of jointly maximizing mutual information and performance. We propose Diverse Quality Species (DQS) as an alternative to archive-based QD algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "单一目标优化的普遍局限性是它可能会被误导，陷入局部最优解。这可以通过质量多样性(QD)算法来纠正，其中首选问题的高质量和多样性解决方案的人群。大多数传统的QD方法，例如MAP-Elites，明确管理解决方案被分解成预定义的壁龛的行为档案。在这项工作中，我们展示了可以在不需要存档或预先定义行为范围的限制下找到多样化的解决方案种群。相反，我们将解决方案分解为独立进化的物种，并使用无监督的技能发现来学习多样化的高性能解决方案。我们表明，这可以通过基于梯度的突变来完成，这些突变采取互信息和性能的信息理论视角共同最大化。我们提出了多样性优质物种(DQS)作为存档型QD算法的替代方法。",
