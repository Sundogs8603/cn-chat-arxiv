    "translated_abstract": "执行预测是一种学习模型并影响其预测数据的框架。本文旨在找到分类器，使其具有执行稳定性，即适用于其产生的数据分布的最佳分类器。在使用重复风险最小化方法找到具有执行稳定性的分类器的标准收敛结果中，假设数据分布对于模型参数是可Lipschitz连续的。在这种情况下，损失必须对这些参数强凸和平滑；否则，该方法将在某些问题上发散。然而本文则假设数据分布是相对于模型的预测值可Lipschitz连续的，这是执行系统的更加自然的假设。结果，我们能够显著放宽对损失函数的假设要求。作为一个说明，我们介绍了一种建模真实数据分布的重采样过程，并使用其来实证执行稳定性相对于其他目标的效益。",

By assuming that the data distribution is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the model's predictions, the assumptions on the loss function can be significantly relaxed, and the authors demonstrate this by introducing a resampling procedure that models realistic data distributions."
