    "translated_abstract": "交通拥堵一直是城市道路网络中的主要挑战。过去进行了大量研究，以凸显与交通拥堵相关的问题，并通过数据驱动的方法解决了这个问题。目前，大多数交通拥堵分析都是使用模拟软件进行的，这些软件由于使用的工具和实用程序的限制而提供了有限的洞见。所有这些都影响到定制业务问题的制定，这些问题因地区和国家而异。通过利用知识图的能力，我们将交通拥堵问题建模为Neo4j图，然后使用负载平衡、优化算法来识别无拥堵的道路网络。我们还展示了在拥堵或事故情况下交通如何向后传播以及其对其他道路段的总体影响。我们还在实时交通数据上训练了顺序RNN-LSTM(长短时记忆)深度学习模型。",
    "tldr": "本文利用Neo4j图和深度学习方法解决城市道路网络中的交通拥堵问题，能够实现拥堵路段的负载平衡和优化，同时可以预测交通事故对整体交通的影响。"
