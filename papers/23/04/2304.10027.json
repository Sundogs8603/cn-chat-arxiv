In lower-income economies, where employment and income from agriculture are substantial, forms of political violence and social conflict may be linked with this sector.

We focus on changes in conflict incidents during the rice harvest season, which is the most produced and consumed cereal crop in the region. We observe an increase in political violence but a decrease in social unrest in rice-producing areas during the harvest season. We investigate different plausible mechanisms that may lead to such effects, by incorporating shocks associated with rice prices and growing season rainfall, and by comparing regions with predominantly irrigated vs predominantly rainfed rice production practices.

    "translated_abstract": "社会冲突是不可避免的，但其发生和强度随时间和地点的不同而异。在低收入经济体中，农业就业和收入的重要性较大，政治暴力和社会冲突可能与该行业相关。我们使用涵盖七个东南亚国家13年期间的冲突数据来研究这种联系。我们重点关注稻谷收获季节中冲突事件的变化，这是该地区生产和消费最多的谷物作物。我们观察到在收获季节的稻米生产地区，政治暴力增加而社会动荡减少。通过考虑与稻谷价格和生长季节降雨相关的冲击，并比较主要是灌溉与主要是雨养稻生产实践的地区，我们研究了可能导致这种效果的不同机制。这些发现为政策制定者提供了重要的见解。",
