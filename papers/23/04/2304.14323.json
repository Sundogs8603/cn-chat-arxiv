In this paper, we show that we can further push the expressivity of this formalism, arriving at an extended logic, called Standpoint EL+, which allows for axiom negation, role chain axioms, self-loops, and other features, while maintaining tractability. This is achieved by designing a satisfiability-checking deduction calculus, which at the same time addresses the need for practical algorithms. We demonstrate the feasibility of our calculus by presenting a prototypical Datalog implementation of its deduction rules.",

    "translated_abstract": "Standpoint EL是流行的描述逻辑EL的多模态扩展，允许相对于不同的观点或角度集成领域知识的综合表示。有利的是，其可满足性问题最近已被证明在P时间内，使其成为大规模知识集成的有前途的框架。在本文中，我们展示了我们可以进一步推动这种形式化的表达能力，到达一个扩展逻辑，称为Standpoint EL+，允许公理否定、角色链公理、自环等特征，同时保持可行性。这是通过设计一个可满足性检测演绎演算法实现的，同时解决实用算法的需求。我们通过提供其演绎规则的原型Datalog实现来展示我们演算法的可行性。",
