    "translated_abstract": "在智能教学系统的迅猛发展中，追踪学生的知识状态越来越重要，以便提供个性化的学习指导。这是知识追踪 (KT) 的主要思想，它根据学生在平台上的过去交互来建立模型，以模拟学生掌握知识概念 (KCs，解决问题所需的技能)。虽然已经提出了许多KT模型，并表现出了卓越的性能，但其中大部分模型使用概念来索引问题，这意味着需要预先确定每个问题所需的技能标签，以指示正确回答该问题所需的KC。这使得这些模型很难应用于大规模的在线教育平台，因为问题通常没有按照技能标签进行很好的组织。本文提出了基于Q-矩阵的注意力知识追踪 (QAKT)，这是一种端到端的模型，能够将注意力方法应用于场景中，其中不存在事先确定的技能标签。",
