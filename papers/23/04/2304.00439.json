    "translated_abstract": "时间序列事件检测方法通常通过标准的分类指标进行评估，这些指标仅关注检测准确性。然而，事件检测的不准确往往是由于前后相关事件在相邻检测中的反应产生的。这些检测对于触发必要的行动或帮助减轻不良后果非常有价值。在这种情况下，现有的指标对于事件检测来说是不充分和不适当的。因此，需要一种指标，既包括时间的概念，又包括对相邻检测的时间容忍度。本文介绍了一种新的指标集合“SoftED metrics”，旨在软评估事件检测方法。它们可以评估检测的准确性以及其检测是否代表事件。通过将事件和代表性检测相结合，并在36\\%以上的实验中加入时间容忍度，提高了事件检测的评估效果。",
