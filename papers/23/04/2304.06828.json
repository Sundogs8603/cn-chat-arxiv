    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的广告因果测量方法，即利用广告暴露的外生变化（RCTs）来针对部分广告活动建立模型，以预测未进行RCTs的广告活动的因果效应。这种方法——预测增效实验（PIE）——将估计广告活动的因果效应视为预测问题，观察单位即为RCT本身。相比之下，传统的因果推断方法通过用户层面调整协变量不平衡。关键的洞见是使用后广告活动特征（比如最后一次点击转换次数）作为预测模型的特征，而这些特征并不需要RCT。我们发现，我们的PIE模型比Gordon等人研究中分析的程序评估方法更好地恢复了每美元增量转换（ICPD）的RCT导出。最佳PIE模型的预测误差分别为48％，42％和62％。",
