    "translated_abstract": "现有的针对新手友好的机器学习（ML）建模工具，侧重于单一用户体验，一个单一用户仅收集自己的数据来构建模型。然而，单独建模经历限制了学习者共同工作时会遇到的交替想法和方法的宝贵机会。因此，当不同的观点体现在群体构建的数据集中时，往往排除了ML围绕数据表现和多样性的关键问题。为解决这个问题，我们创建了Co-ML——一个面向学习者的基于平板电脑的应用程序，通过端对端的迭代模型构建流程，协同构建ML图像分类器。在本文中，我们通过介绍一个家庭（由两个11和14岁的孩子与父母一起工作）在家中使用Co-ML进行引导性介绍ML活动的深入案例研究，展示了协作建模的可行性和潜在丰富性。我们分享了Co-ML系统的d。",
