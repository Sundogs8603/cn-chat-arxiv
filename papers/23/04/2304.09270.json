Using data from 418K emergency department visits, we assess clinical risk score performance disparities across granular race groups for three outcomes, five risk scores, and four performance metrics. Across outcomes and metrics, we show that there are significant granular disparities in performance within coarse race categories. In fact, variation in performance metrics within coarse groups often exceeds the variation between coarse groups. We explore why these disparities arise, finding that outcome rates, feature distributions, and the relationships between features and outcomes all vary significantly across granular race categories.

    "translated_abstract": "美国的医疗保健数据通常只记录病人的粗略种族组：例如，印度和中国病人通常都被编码为“亚洲人”。然而，目前还不清楚这种粗略编码是否掩盖了精细种族组之间的临床风险评分表现的显著差异。本文利用418K紧急科室就诊的数据，评估了三种结局、五种风险评分和四种表现指标的精细种族组之间的临床风险评分表现差异。在各种结局和指标中，我们表明，粗略种族类别内存在重要的表现差异。事实上，在粗略类别内，性能指标的变异常常超过粗略类别之间的变异。我们探讨了这些差异的原因，发现结局率、特征分布以及特征与结果之间的关系在不同精细种族类别之间都有显着差异。我们的结果表明，仅依赖粗糙的种族类别可能掩盖了临床风险评分表现中的重要差异，并强调了医疗保健环境中需要收集更精细的种族数据。",
