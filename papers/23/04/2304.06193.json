    "abstract": "This paper presents a policy parameterization for learning-based control on nonlinear, partially-observed dynamical systems. The parameterization is based on a nonlinear version of the Youla parameterization and the recently proposed Recurrent Equilibrium Network (REN) class of models. We prove that the resulting Youla-REN parameterization automatically satisfies stability (contraction) and user-tunable robustness (Lipschitz) conditions on the closed-loop system. This means it can be used for safe learning-based control with no additional constraints or projections required to enforce stability or robustness. We test the new policy class in simulation on two reinforcement learning tasks: 1) magnetic suspension, and 2) inverting a rotary-arm pendulum. We find that the Youla-REN performs similarly to existing learning-based and optimal control methods while also ensuring stability and exhibiting improved robustness to adversarial disturbances.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对非线性部分观测动态系统提出了一种基于 Youla 参数化和最近提出的 REN 模型的学习控制策略参数化。我们证明，该策略参数化自动满足了闭环系统的稳定性（收敛）和用户可调整的鲁棒性（Lipschitz）条件。这意味着它可以用于安全的基于学习的控制，不需要额外的约束或投影来强制稳定性或鲁棒性。我们在两个强化学习任务的模拟中测试了新的策略类：1）磁悬浮，2）倒置旋转臂摆。我们发现 Youla-REN 在确保稳定性和展示对敌对扰动提高的鲁棒性的同时，表现类似于现有的学习控制和最优控制方法。",
