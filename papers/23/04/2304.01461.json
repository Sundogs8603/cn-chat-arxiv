    "translated_abstract": "低通道EEG设备对于便携和娱乐应用至关重要，然而EEG低空间分辨率存在挑战，难以解码低通道运动想象。本研究引入TSFF-Net，一种新颖的网络架构，将时间-空间-频率特征融合，在时间序列或时间-频率模态下的单模特征提取网络的限制下发挥作用。TSFF-Net包括四个主要组件：时间-频率表示、时间-频率特征提取、时间-空间特征提取和特征融合与分类。时间-频率表示和特征提取将原始EEG信号转换为时间-频率谱图并提取相关特征。时空网络将时间序列EEG试验作为输入处理，并提取时间-空间特征。特征融合采用MMD损失在再生核希尔伯特空间中约束时间-频率和时间-空间特征的分布。",
