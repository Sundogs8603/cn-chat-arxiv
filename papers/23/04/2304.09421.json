    "translated_abstract": "假新闻检测旨在检测在社交媒体平台上广泛传播的虚假新闻，这可能会对公众和政府产生负面影响。许多方法已经开发出来，以从新闻图像、文本或视频中获取相关信息。然而，这些方法可能会面临以下限制：（1）忽略新闻中固有的情感信息，这可能有益，因为它包含作者的主观意图；（2）对于新闻文章中标题与正文之间的关系（相似度）给予很少关注，这经常使用无关标题来吸引读者的注意力。为此，我们提出一种新颖的标题-正文相似度和情感感知假新闻检测（TieFake）方法，通过在统一框架中共同建模多模态上下文信息和作者情感来实现。具体而言，我们分别使用BERT和ResNeSt来学习文本和图像的表示，并利用发行方情感提取器。",
