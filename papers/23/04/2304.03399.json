    "translated_abstract": "命名实体识别(NER)是一项自然语言处理任务(NLP)，旨在识别命名实体并对其进行分类，如人物、地点、组织等。在阿拉伯语中，可以找到相当数量的非结构化数据，需要使用不同的预处理工具处理，而不同于英语、俄语、德语等的语言。因此，在解决结构化数据缺乏的问题时，构建一个新的结构化数据集的重要性引人注目。本文使用BIOES格式标记单词，这使我们可以处理由多个句子组成的嵌套命名实体，并定义名称的开始和结束。该数据集包含三万六千多条记录。此外，本文提出使用长短时记忆(LSTM)单元和门控循环单元(GRU)构建阿拉伯语命名实体识别模型。该模型给出了近80%的良好结果，因为LSTM和GRU模型可以找到当前词和前面词之间的关系，这对于阿拉伯语的复杂语法结构非常重要。",
