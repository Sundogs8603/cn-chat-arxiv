    "translated_abstract": "在语义分割中使用多个空间模态已被证明有助于提高性能。然而，现实中还存在一些挑战，需要解决：(a) 提高标签效率；(b) 在测试时模态缺失的情况下增强模型鲁棒性。为了解决这些挑战，我们首先提出了一种简单而高效的多模态融合机制线性融合，即使在有限监督下，表现也比最先进的多模态模型更好。其次，我们提出了M3L：Masked Modality Learning的多模态教师半监督框架，它不仅提高了多模态性能，还使用未标记的数据使模型在现实情况下对缺失模态更加鲁棒。我们创建了第一个半监督多模态语义分割基准，并报告了对缺失模态的鲁棒性。我们的提议在合成和现实世界数据集上在鲁棒mIoU上比最重要的基线有最多10％的绝对改进。",
