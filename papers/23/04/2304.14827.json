    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在定量评估ChatGPT，在时间关系、因果关系和语篇关系等句间关系方面的性能。考虑到ChatGPT在各种任务中表现出色，我们在13个数据集的整个测试集上进行了广泛的评估，包括时间和因果关系、基于PDTB2.0和基于对话的语篇关系，以及关于对话理解的下游应用。为了获得可靠的结果，我们采用了三种针对每个任务的定制提示模板，包括零-shot提示模板、零-shot提示工程（PE）模板和上下文学习（ICL）提示模板，为所有流行的句对关系分类任务建立了初始基准分数。我们发现，ChatGPT在检测和推理因果关系方面表现出色，但可能不擅长识别句子间的时间顺序。ICL方法特别适用于提高一些数据集上的模型性能。我们的发现为模型改进和有效提示模板的设计提供了一些见解。",
