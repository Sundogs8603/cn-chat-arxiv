    "translated_abstract": "精确的股骨肌体积对于监测患有各种程度股骨肌损失疾病患者的运动功能至关重要。由于其在肌肉和脂肪信号之间的对比，T1加权MRI是获得股骨肌肉掩蔽的默认替代方法。最近，深度学习方法被广泛用于通过分割获得这些掩蔽。然而，由于精确定义的注释数量不足，通过深度学习方法生成的股骨肌肉掩蔽往往会将肌内脂肪(IMF)误分类为肌肉，影响肌肉容积分析。由于IMF被浸润在肌肉内，人类注释需要专业知识和时间。因此，在实践中，剔除IMF的精确肌肉掩蔽是有限的。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了一个少样本分割框架以生成剔除IMF的股骨肌肉掩蔽。在我们的框架中，我们设计了新的伪标签修正和评估方案，以及一个新的抗噪损失。",
