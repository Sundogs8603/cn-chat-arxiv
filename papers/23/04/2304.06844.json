    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统越来越成功地向用户推荐个性化内容。然而，这些系统常常利用热门内容，且用户兴趣的持续演进需要被捕捉，但没有直接的方式来系统性地探索用户的兴趣。这也经常影响到推荐系统的整体质量，因为训练数据是从推荐给用户的候选项中生成的。本文提出了一种用于大规模推荐系统中的探索框架来解决这些挑战。它由三个部分组成：第一部分是用户创建者探索，专注于识别用户感兴趣的最佳创建者，第二部分是在线探索框架，第三部分是一个平衡探索与利用的反馈组成机制，以确保探索性视频的最佳普及率。我们的方法可以很容易地被集成到现有的大规模推荐系统中，只需进行最小限度的修改。",
