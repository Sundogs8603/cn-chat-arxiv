    "translated_abstract": "Kaczmarz方法（KZ）及其变体是一类随机梯度下降（SGD）方法，由于其简单高效地解决线性方程组而被广泛研究。迭代阈值（IHT）方法在多个研究领域中广受欢迎，包括压缩感知或稀疏线性回归，带有额外结构的机器学习以及带有非凸约束的优化。最近，提出了一种名为基于Kaczmarz的IHT（KZIHT）的混合方法，结合了两种方法的优点，但它的理论保证缺失。本文通过展示当使用重洗数据采样方案时，KZIHT线性地收敛到具有稀疏约束的系统的解，并提供了KZIHT的第一个理论收敛保证。我们还提出了Kaczmarz周期阈值（KZPT）方法，它通过应用阈值操作来推广KZIHT。",
