    "abstract": "Background: Recently, ChatGPT and similar generative AI models have attracted hundreds of millions of users and become part of the public discourse.

So far, this belief is based on either colloquial evidence or benchmarks from the owners of the models -- both lack scientific rigour.  Objective: Through a large-scale study comparing human-written versus ChatGPT-generated argumentative student essays, we systematically assess the quality of the AI-generated content.  Methods: A large corpus of essays was rated using standard criteria by a large number of human experts (teachers). We augment the analysis with a consideration of the linguistic characteristics of the generated essays.  Results: Our results demonstrate that ChatGPT generates essays that are rated higher for quality than human-written essays. The writing style of the AI m",

    "translated_abstract": "背景：最近，ChatGPT及类似的AI生成模型吸引了数亿用户，成为公众话题的一部分。许多人认为这样的模型将会打乱社会，导致未来教育系统和信息生成的显著变化。然而，迄今为止，这种信念基于的是口头证据或模型拥有者的基准——这两者缺乏科学严谨性。目标：通过大规模研究比较人类写作和ChatGPT生成论证性学生文章的质量，我们系统地评估了AI生成内容的质量。方法：一大批文章语料库被许多人类专家（教师）使用标准标准评分。我们在分析中加入了对生成文章的语言特征的考虑。结果：我们的结果表明，ChatGPT生成的文章比人类写作的文章质量更高。AI的写作风格更加流畅，而且比人类写作出现更少的语法和拼写错误。",
    "tldr": "ChatGPT生成的文章质量比人类写作的文章更高，写作风格更流畅，语法和拼写错误更少。"
