    "translated_abstract": "时间信息是一种常用的建模方式，通常使用生存分析方法来估计基于输入特征的生存得分。近年来，使用神经网络等现代工具开发更准确的个性化医疗时间预测模型引起了广泛关注。更高质量的特征和更频繁的观测有助于提高患者的预测结果，然而，加入患者基于地理位置的公共卫生统计数据对个体预测的影响尚未研究。本文提出了一种补充改进生存分析模型的方法，即将公共卫生统计信息纳入输入特征。我们证明在包含全国性癌症发病数据的 Surveillance，Epidemiology 和 End Results（SEER）数据集上，包含地理定位的公共健康信息可以显著提高一致性指数。特别是在公共卫生数据的地理分辨率较高时，这种改进效果更加明显，并以亚特兰大和旧金山地区的癌症发病病例研究为例。",
