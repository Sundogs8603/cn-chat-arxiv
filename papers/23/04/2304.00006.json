Bi-directional personalization reinforcement learning-based architecture with active learning can get recruiters to recommend qualified applicants and also enable applicants to receive personalized job recommendations. This paper focuses on how machine learning techniques can enhance the recruitment process in the travel nursing industry by helping speed up data acquisition using a multi-model data service and then providing personalized recommendations using bi-directional reinforcement learning with active learning. This need was especially evident when trying to respond to the overwhelming needs of healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The need for traveling nurses and other healthcare professionals was more evident during the lockdown period.
