    "translated_abstract": "谵妄症状是一种急性的认知功能下降或波动，可能导致严重的不良后果。由于谵妄症状的短暂和多样性，它经常被忽视且未被编码到患者的电子病历中。自然语言处理是一种从临床叙述中提取医学概念的关键技术，在谵妄症状和后果的研究中显示出巨大的潜力。为了辅助谵妄症状的诊断和表型描述，我们组成了专家小组来分类不同的谵妄症状，编写注释指南，创建了包含多样化谵妄症状的数据集，并开发了从临床记录中提取谵妄症状的NLP方法。我们比较了包括2种常规领域模型（BERT和RoBERTa）和3种临床领域模型（BERT_MIMIC，RoBERTa_MIMIC和GatorTron）在内的5种最先进的转换器模型。GatorTron取得了最佳的结果。",
