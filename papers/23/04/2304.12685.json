    "translated_abstract": "尽管自监督单帧和多帧深度估计方法都只需要无标签单目视频进行训练，但它们所利用的信息不同，单帧方法主要依赖于基于外貌的特征，而多帧方法则专注于几何线索。考虑到单帧和多帧方法的互补信息，一些工作尝试利用单帧深度来改进多帧深度。但是，这些方法既不能利用单帧深度和多帧深度之间的差异来改进多帧深度，也不能利用多帧深度来优化单帧深度模型。为了充分利用单帧和多帧方法之间的相互影响，我们提出了一种新的自监督训练框架。具体而言，我们首先引入一个由单帧深度指导的像素逐像素自适应深度采样模块来训练多帧模型。然后，我们利用最小重投影为基础的蒸馏方法来利用多帧深度优化单帧深度的模型。",
