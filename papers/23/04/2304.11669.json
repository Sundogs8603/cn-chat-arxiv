    "abstract": "Deployment of solutions based on TinyML requires meeting several challenges. These include hardware heterogeneity, microprocessor (MCU) architectures, and resource availability constraints. Another challenge is the variety of operating systems for MCU, limited memory management implementations and limited software interoperability between devices. A number of these challenges are solved by dedicated programming libraries and the ability to compile code for specific devices. Nevertheless, the challenge discussed in the paper is the issue of network connectivity for such solutions. We point out that more emphasis should be placed on standard protocols, interoperability of solutions and security.
