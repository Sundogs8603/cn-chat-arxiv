    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱中针对少量数据、长尾的关系推理（FS-KGR）近年来因其实用性而备受关注。之前的方法需要手动构建元关系集来预训练，导致了大量的劳动成本。自监督学习（SSL）被视为解决这个问题的方案，但在FS-KGR任务中仍处于早期阶段。此外，大多数现有方法忽略了利用与目标数据稀少关系具有类似上下文语义的同义关系（AR）的有益信息。因此，我们提出了一种使用同义关系辅助的自监督学习模型，命名为SARF。具体地，我们的模型设计了四个主要组成部分，即SSL推理模块、AR辅助机制、融合模块和评分函数。我们首先以生成式的方式生成共现模式的表示，同时设计AR辅助机制来捕捉数据稀少关系的相似上下文语义。然后，这两个表示被融合起来生成综合特征表示。最后，我们采用评分函数来预测基于此特征表示的目标关系。两个广泛使用的基准测试上的实验结果表明SARF优于最先进的方法。",
