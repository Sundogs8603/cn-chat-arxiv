In this paper, we introduce a novel taxonomy that categorizes scholarly writing behaviors according to intention, writer actions, and the information types of the written data. We also provide ManuScript, an original dataset annotated with a simplified version of our taxonomy to show writer actions and the intentions behind them. Motivated by cognitive writing theory, our taxonomy for scientific papers includes three levels of categorization in order to trace the general writing flow and identify the distinct writer activities embedded within each higher-level process.

    "translated_abstract": "学术写作是一个复杂的领域，通常按照系统性的程序规划和制作既有合理性又富有创造性的作品。最近，大型语言模型（LLM）在文本生成和修订任务方面取得了相当的成功；然而，LLM仍然难以在文档层面上提供结构和创造性反馈，这对于学术写作至关重要。本文介绍了一个新的分类法，根据意图、写作者的行为及其所写数据的信息类型将学术写作行为分类，并提供了ManuScript数据集，其中包括我们分类法的简化版本及作家行为和意图等注释。我们的分类法包括三个级别，以追踪总体写作流程并识别嵌入在每个高级过程中的不同写作者活动。 ManuScript由1000多个语言表达特征组成，这些特征是通过对句子的全面解析和逻辑结构的注释而获得的。我们证明了我们的分类法能够有效地解码学术手稿的端到端写作轨迹，通过提供关于写作者意图、行为和使用信息类型的详细信息，实现对文档层面上更细致的分析和反馈。",
