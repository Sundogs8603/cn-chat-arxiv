As a form of local per-query explanations, we introduce the notion of equivalent queries that are generated by maximizing the similarity between the NRM's results and the result set of a sparse retrieval system with the equivalent query. We then compare this approach with existing methods such as RM3-based query expansion and contrast differences in retrieval effectiveness and in the terms generated by each approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "相比于传统统计模型，神经检索模型(NRMs)因为可以通过稠密文档表示来捕捉语义意义而显示出更好的检索性能。然而，由于其不依赖于明确的词项匹配，这些模型往往可读性差。为了生成一种基于局部查询解释的新方法，我们引入了“等价查询”的概念，通过最大化NRM结果与具有等价查询的稀疏检索系统的结果集之间的相似性来生成等价查询。我们将这种方法与现有方法(如基于RM3的查询扩展)进行了比较，并对检索效果和每种方法生成的词项进行了对比。",

Equivalent queries are generated by maximizing the similarity between the NRM's results and the result set of a sparse retrieval system with the equivalent query. The approach is compared with existing methods and differences in retrieval effectiveness and in the terms generated by each approach are contrasted."
