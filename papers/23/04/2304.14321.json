    "abstract": "Person Re-ID has been gaining a lot of attention and nowadays is of fundamental importance in many camera surveillance applications. The task consists of identifying individuals across multiple cameras that have no overlapping views. Most of the approaches require labeled data, which is not always available, given the huge amount of demanded data and the difficulty of manually assigning a class for each individual. Recently, studies have shown that re-ranking methods are capable of achieving significant gains, especially in the absence of labeled data. Besides that, the fusion of feature extractors and multiple-source training is another promising research direction not extensively exploited.

    "translated_abstract": "人员再识别已经引起了广泛的关注，现在在许多监控应用中具有基本重要性。该任务包括在没有重叠视图的多个摄像头之间识别个人。大多数方法都需要标记数据，但由于需求量庞大且手动为每个人指定类别的难度较大，标记数据并不总是可用的。最近的研究表明，重新排名方法能够实现显著的收益，特别是在没有标记数据的情况下。此外，特征提取器的融合和多源训练也是另一个非常有前景的研究方向，但并未被广泛利用。我们旨在通过一种流形排名聚合方法，利用不同的人员再识别排名器的互补性填补这一空白。在本工作中，我们对从多个和多样化的特征提取器获得的不同排名列表进行了完全无监督的选择和融合。",
