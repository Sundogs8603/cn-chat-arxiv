Recently, technology companies such as Microsoft and Google have announced new services which aim to combine search engines with conversational AI. However, we have found numerous mistakes in the public demonstrations that suggest we should not easily trust the factual claims of the AI models. Rather than criticizing specific models or companies, we hope to call on researchers and developers to improve AI models' transparency and factual correctness.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管像OpenAI的ChatGPT这样的大型对话型AI模型展现出了巨大的潜力，但我们质疑这些模型能否保证事实准确性。最近，微软和谷歌等科技公司宣布了旨在将搜索引擎与对话型AI相结合的新服务。然而，我们发现公开演示中存在许多错误，这表明我们不应轻易相信AI模型的事实主张。我们希望呼吁研究人员和开发人员改善AI模型的透明度和事实正确性，而不是批评特定的模型或公司。",
