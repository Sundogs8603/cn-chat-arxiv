    "abstract": "Individuals involved in gang-related activity use mainstream social media including Facebook and Twitter to express taunts and threats as well as grief and memorializing. However, identifying the impact of gang-related activity in order to serve community member needs through social media sources has a unique set of challenges.

Our study provides evidence of methods where natural language processing tools can be helpful in efficiently identifying individuals who may be in need of community care resources such as counselors, conflict mediators, or academic/professional training programs.

    "translated_abstract": "参与帮派活动的人使用包括Facebook和Twitter在内的主流社交媒体来表达嘲讽和威胁以及哀悼和纪念。然而，识别帮派相关活动的影响以通过社交媒体为社区成员提供帮助是具有独特挑战的，这包括道德上识别受帮派活动影响的个体的训练数据的困难和需要考虑这些个体在推文中常用的非标准语言风格。我们的研究提供了证据表明，自然语言处理工具可以有效地识别可能需要社区照顾资源，如顾问、冲突调解者或学术/专业培训计划的个体。我们证明了我们的二元逻辑分类器在识别受帮派相关暴力影响的个体时，在使用与2015年巴尔的摩暴动相关的帮派相关推文样本时，优于基线标准。",
