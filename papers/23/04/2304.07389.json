    "abstract": "This paper presents Shape of You (SoY), an approach to improve the accuracy of 3D body shape estimation for vision-based clothing recommendation systems. While existing methods have successfully estimated 3D poses, there remains a lack of work in precise shape estimation, particularly for diverse human bodies. To address this gap, we propose two loss functions that can be readily integrated into parametric 3D human reconstruction pipelines. Additionally, we propose a test-time optimization routine that further improves quality. Our method improves over the recent SHAPY method by 17.7% on the challenging SSP-3D dataset. We consider our work to be a step towards a more accurate 3D shape estimation system that works reliably on diverse body types and holds promise for practical applications in the fashion industry.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种名为SoY的方法，旨在改善基于视觉的服装推荐系统中3D身体形状估计的准确性。尽管现有的方法已经成功地估计了3D姿势，但在精确形状估计方面，尤其是对于不同的人体类型，仍存在缺乏的问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了两种损失函数，可以轻松地集成到参数化的3D人体重建管道中。此外，我们还提出了一种测试时优化例程，进一步提高了质量。我们的方法在具有挑战性的SSP-3D数据集上比最近的SHAPY方法提高了17.7％。我们认为我们的工作是朝着更准确的3D形态估计系统迈出的一步，该系统可在不同的体型上可靠地工作，并有望在时尚行业中得到实际应用。",
