A unique equivalent martingale measure (EMM) is obtained using filtration reduction to a fictitious complete market. This unique EMM in the fictitious market is uplifted to the original economy using the notion of consistency. For pedagogical purposes, we begin with simple setups and progressively extend to models of increasing generality.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在摩擦无限和竞争但不完全的跳-扩散市场中的衍生品定价和对冲。通过将市场缩减到一个虚构的完全市场，得到了一个独特的等价鞅测度（EMM）。使用一致性概念将虚构市场中的唯一EMM应用于原始经济体。出于教学目的，从简单的设置开始逐渐扩展到逐渐增加一般性的模型。",
