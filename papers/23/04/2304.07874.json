    "translated_abstract": "近年来，图像去雾引起了越来越多的关注。许多深度学习方法已经被提出来应对这一挑战，并在处理均质雾时取得了显著的成就。然而，这些解决方案无法在应用于存在非均质雾的图像时保持类似的性能，例如NTIRE挑战介绍的NH-HAZE23数据集。其中一个失败的原因是非均质雾不符合建模均质雾所需的假设之一。此外，传统的端到端训练方法需要对大量的非均质雾图像与其清晰对应项进行配对，而NH-HAZE23数据集的数量是有限的。尽管可以通过利用其他非均质去雾数据集扩充NH-HAZE23数据集，但我们观察到有必要设计一种适当的数据预处理方法以减少目标数据集之间的分布差距。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种基于Vision Transformer的数据中心的解决方案，用于解决非均质去雾问题。传统方法在处理NH-HAZE23数据集等非均质雾图像时存在问题，因为它们无法满足建模均质雾所需的假设之一。同时，本文指出光靠数据增广并不能解决问题，因为需要处理分布差异。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a data-centric solution based on Vision Transformer to tackle non-homogeneous haze in images. Traditional methods fail to model non-homogeneous haze as it doesn't meet the assumption required for modeling homogeneous haze. Data augmentation alone cannot bridge the distribution gaps between limited non-homogeneous hazy images such as NH-HAZE23 dataset."
