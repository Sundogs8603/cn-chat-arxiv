    "abstract": "Lexical ambiguity presents a profound and enduring challenge to the language sciences. Researchers for decades have grappled with the problem of how language users learn, represent and process words with more than one meaning. Our work offers new insight into psychological understanding of lexical ambiguity through a series of simulations that capitalise on recent advances in contextual language models. These models have no grounded understanding of the meanings of words at all; they simply learn to predict words based on the surrounding context provided by other words. Yet, our analyses show that their representations capture fine-grained meaningful distinctions between unambiguous, homonymous, and polysemous words that align with lexicographic classifications and psychological theorising. These findings provide quantitative support for modern psychological conceptualisations of lexical ambiguity and raise new challenges for understanding of the way that contextual information shapes ",

    "translated_abstract": "词汇歧义是语言科学中一个深刻而持久的挑战。我们的工作通过一系列模拟研究，利用最近在上下文化语言模型方面的进展，提供了对词汇歧义心理理解的新见解。尽管这些模型本身并没有任何与词语意思相关的理解，它们只是学习基于其他词汇提供的周围环境来预测词语。我们的分析表明，它们的表征捕捉到可以与词典分类和心理理论相一致的，对于无歧义、异义和多义词之间的细微有意义差别。这些发现为现代心理学对词汇歧义的概念化提供了定量支持，并提出了理解上下文信息如何影响单词表示的新挑战。",
