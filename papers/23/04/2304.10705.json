    "translated_abstract": "多示例多标签（MIML）学习被广泛应用于许多领域，如图像分类，其中一个图像包含同时与多个逻辑标签相关的多个示例。现有 MIML 中的相关标签都被假定为具有相等意义的逻辑标签。然而，在 MIML 的实际应用中，每个标签对于每个多示例背包（如一个图像）的重要性差异显著。忽略标签的重要性将大大损失对象的语义信息，使 MIML 在复杂场景中的学习性能不佳。为此，本文提出了一种基于图标签增强的新型 MIML 框架，即 GLEMIML，通过利用标签重要性来提高 MIML 的分类性能。GLEMIML 首先通过建立图来识别实例之间的关联，然后通过邻域传播将从特征空间中挖掘的隐式信息迁移到标签空间中。最后，提出一种基于图的标签增强策略，以增强不同重要性级别的实例标签。实验结果表明，与几种最先进的 MIML 方法相比，GLEMIML 的有效性和优越性都得到了证明。",
