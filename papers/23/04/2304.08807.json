    "abstract": "This paper studies the task of best counter-argument retrieval given an input argument. Following the definition that the best counter-argument addresses the same aspects as the input argument while having the opposite stance, we aim to develop an efficient and effective model for scoring counter-arguments based on similarity and dissimilarity metrics. We first conduct an experimental study on the effectiveness of available scoring methods, including traditional Learning-To-Rank (LTR) and recent neural scoring models. We then propose Bipolar-encoder, a novel BERT-based model to learn an optimal representation for simultaneous similarity and dissimilarity. Experimental results show that our proposed method can achieve the accuracy@1 of 88.9\\%, which significantly outperforms other baselines by a large margin. When combined with an appropriate caching technique, Bipolar-encoder is comparably efficient at prediction time.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在给定输入论点情况下的最佳反驳检索任务。根据最佳反驳定义，最佳反驳应与输入论点在细节方面相似，但立场相反。本文旨在开发一种基于相似性和差异性度量的高效和有效的模型来对反驳进行评分。我们首先对现有的评分方法（包括传统的学习排序（LTR）和最近的神经评分模型）进行了实证研究。然后，我们提出了Bipolar-encoder，一种基于BERT的新型模型，用于学习同时相似性和差异性的最优表示。实验结果表明，我们提出的方法可以达到88.9％的accuracy@1，显著优于其他基线模型。当与适当的缓存技术结合使用时，Bipolar-encoder在预测时间上也具有可比性的效率。",
