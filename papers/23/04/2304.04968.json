    "translated_abstract": "尽管文本到图像扩散模型在从文本生成图像方面取得了显著进展，但它们有时更倾向于生成类似于模型训练数据的图像，而不是提供的文本。这限制了它们在2D和3D应用中的使用。为了解决这个问题，我们探索了使用负面提示，但发现当前的实现无法产生期望的结果，特别是当主提示和负面提示之间存在重叠时。为了克服这个问题，我们提出Perp-Neg，一种利用得分空间的几何特性来解决当前负性提示算法缺点的新算法。Perp-Neg不需要对模型进行任何训练或微调。此外，我们通过实验表明，Perp-Neg通过在2D情况下使用户能够编辑掉初始生成的图像中不想要的概念，提供了生成图像更大的灵活性。此外，为了扩展我们的算法到3D应用，我们还提出了一种基于Perp-Neg的3D负面提示算法。",
