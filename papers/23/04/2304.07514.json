    "abstract": "Personalized FL has been widely used to cater to heterogeneity challenges with non-IID data. A primary obstacle is considering the personalization process from the client's perspective to preserve their autonomy. Allowing the clients to participate in personalized FL decisions becomes significant due to privacy and security concerns, where the clients may not be at liberty to share private information necessary for producing good quality personalized models. Moreover, clients with high-quality data and resources are reluctant to participate in the FL process without reasonable incentive. In this paper, we propose PI-FL, a one-shot personalization solution complemented by a token-based incentive mechanism that rewards personalized training. PI-FL outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches and can generate good-quality personalized models while respecting clients' privacy.",

    "translated_abstract": "个性化联邦学习已被广泛应用于应对非独立同分布数据异质性的挑战。主要问题是考虑来自客户端的个性化过程以保护其自治权。允许客户端参与个性化联邦学习决策变得重要，因为存在隐私和安全问题，客户端可能无法自由共享生成良好质量个性化模型所必需的私人信息。此外，具有高质量数据和资源的客户端不愿意在没有合理激励的情况下参与联邦学习过程。在本文中，我们提出了PI-FL，这是一个一次性个性化解决方案，配合一个基于令牌的激励机制，奖励个性化训练。PI-FL优于其他最先进的方法，并且可以在尊重客户端隐私的同时生成高质量的个性化模型。",
