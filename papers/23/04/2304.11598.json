    "translated_abstract": "少样学习(FSL)因其适应新领域的能力而受欢迎。与归纳式少样学习相比，传导式模型通常表现更好，因为它们利用查询集的所有样本。现有方法的两个类别，基于原型和基于图形的方法，分别具有原型估计不准确和核函数下亚优图形构建的缺点。本文提出了一种新的基于原型的标签传播方法来解决这些问题。具体而言，我们的图形构建基于原型和样本之间的关系，而不是样本之间。随着原型的更新，图形也会随之变化。我们还估计每个原型的标签，而不是将原型视为类中心。在mini-ImageNet，tiered-ImageNet，CIFAR-FS和CUB数据集上，我们展示了所提出的方法在少样迁移学习和半监督FSL方面优于其他现有最先进的方法。",
