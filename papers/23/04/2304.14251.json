    "abstract": "Variational Bayes is a popular method for approximate inference but its derivation can be cumbersome. To simplify the process, we give a 3-step recipe to identify the posterior form by explicitly looking for linearity with respect to expectations of well-known distributions. We can then directly write the update by simply ``reading-off'' the terms in front of those expectations. The recipe makes the derivation easier, faster, shorter, and more general.",

    "translated_abstract": "变分贝叶斯方法是一种流行的近似推断方法，但其推导过程可能很繁琐。为了简化这个过程，我们给出了一个三步骤的方法，通过显式寻找关于已知分布期望的线性性，来确定后验分布形式。然后我们可以直接通过“读取”这些期望前的项，写出更新。这个方法使得推导更加简单，快速，简短和通用。",
