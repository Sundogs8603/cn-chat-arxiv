Our evaluation was conducted on our real-world dataset, using binary and multi-label classification tasks on CWE vulnerabilities. We decided to evaluate the model because it has shown good performance on other code-based tasks, such as solving programming challenges and understanding code at a high level. However, we found that the ChatGPT model performed no better than a dummy classifier for both binary and multi-label classification tasks for code vulnerability detection.",
