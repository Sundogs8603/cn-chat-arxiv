    "abstract": "This paper examines how uncertainty about the relevance of external signals (such as news about a competitor or about changes in macroeconomic factors) influences investor beliefs, market prices and voluntary disclosures by companies. Despite assuming independence between the signal relevance and the endowment with information of a firm manager, our results show that: (i) favorable external signals are perceived to be less relevant; (ii) because such signals are taken ``with a grain of salt,\" the investor beliefs that the manager is endowed with unfavorable information are reinforced. As a consequence, a discontinuity in investor beliefs and non-monotonicity in stock prices may occur, such that more favorable external signals could paradoxically lead to a decrease in market valuation. In line with the growing empirical evidence in this area, our model predicts asymmetric price reactions to favorable and unfavorable news as well as potential price declines following firm disclosures.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了外部信号（例如有关竞争对手或宏观经济因素变化的新闻）相关性的不确定性如何影响投资者信念、市场价格和公司自愿披露。尽管假设信号相关性与公司经理信息拥有相互独立，我们的结果表明：（i）有利的外部信号被认为不那么重要；（ii）因为这些信号被“带着一块盐”接受，投资者信念经理拥有不利信息被加强。因此，投资者信念中的不连续性和股票价格的非单调性可能会导致更有利的外部信号出现矛盾地导致市场估值下降。与这一领域不断增长的实证证据一致，我们的模型预测了对有利和不利新闻的不对称价格反应以及公司披露后可能出现的价格下降。",
