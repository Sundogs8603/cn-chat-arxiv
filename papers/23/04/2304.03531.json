    "translated_abstract": "实体集扩展（ESE）是一项至关重要的任务，旨在扩展由小的种子实体集描述的目标语义类的实体。大多数现有的ESE方法是基于检索的框架，需要提取实体的上下文特征，并计算种子实体和候选实体之间的相似性。为了实现这两个目的，它们必须迭代地遍历语料库和数据集中提供的实体词汇，导致效率和可扩展性较差。实验结果表明，基于检索的ESE方法消耗的时间与实体词汇和语料库的大小成线性增长。本文首先提出了一种生成式ESE框架，Generative Entity Set Expansion (GenExpan)，它利用生成式预训练语言模型来完成ESE任务。具体而言，采用前缀树来保证实体生成的有效性，并采用自动生成的类名来引导模型生成同一类实体。",
