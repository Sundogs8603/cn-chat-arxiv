    "translated_abstract": "柔性双工（FD）技术（包括动态时分双工（D-TDD）和动态频分双工（D-FDD））被认为是实现5G-Advanced或6G移动通信系统更灵活的上行/下行传输的一种有前途的解决方案。然而，它可能引入严重的交叉链接干扰（CLI）。为了更好地减轻CLI的影响，我们首先提出了一个更现实的基站（BS）到BS通道模型，其中包含射频（RF）链路特性，这些特性表现出一种硬件依赖性非线性属性，因此传统通道建模的精度不足以用于CLI的取消。然后，我们提出了一个基于通道参数估计的多项式CLI抵消器和两个使用轻量级前馈神经网络（FNN）的机器学习（ML）CLI抵消器。我们的模拟结果和分析表明，与多项式抵消器相比，基于ML的CLI抵消器实现了显着的性能提高和计算复杂度和内存消耗的显著降低，特别适用于在FD MIMO系统中进行实际实现。",
