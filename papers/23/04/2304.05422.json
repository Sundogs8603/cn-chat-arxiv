    "translated_abstract": "处于深空恶劣环境中能够根据需要自适应的物理化学性质的材料将在定义未来的空间探索方面变得至关重要。在自然界中，微妙的微观结构和格子几何形状是设计适应于特定环境材料的令人兴奋的灵感来源。然而，由于这种不规则拓扑覆盖的巨大设计空间，在分析上进行探索是具有挑战性的。因此，迄今为止，大多数合成晶格材料都是基于周期性结构。在本文中，我们提出了一种计算方法，使用图形表示对规则和不规则晶格材料进行建模。我们的方法使用可微分传递算法计算力学性质，因此可以使用自动微分来调整单个晶格元素的几何结构和属性，从而设计具有所需属性的材料。引入对晶格结构和材料属性的隐式可学习几何表示，结合反设计框架，实现了可扩展的、具有前所未有的结构和功能多样性的晶格材料设计方法。",
