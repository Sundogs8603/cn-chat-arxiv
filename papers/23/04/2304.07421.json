    "translated_abstract": "自然驾驶行为识别（NDAR）已被证明是一种检测驾驶员分心和减少交通事故风险的有效方法。然而，车内相机的侵入式设计引起了对驾驶员隐私的担忧。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新颖的点对点（P2P）联邦学习（FL）框架，即FedPC，它确保了隐私并提高了学习效率，同时减少了通信、计算和存储开销。我们的框架专注于在无服务FL框架中解决客户端的目标，旨在提供个性化和准确的NDAR模型。我们在两个现实世界的NDAR数据集上展示和评估了FedPC的性能，包括2023年AICity挑战赛中的State Farm分心驾驶带检测和Track 3 NDAR数据集。我们实验的结果突出了FedPC相对于传统的客户端到服务器（C2S）FL的强大竞争力。",
