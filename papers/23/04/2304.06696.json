    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新方法，使用生成对抗网络（GAN）框架下训练的人工神经网络（ANN）来解决识别未知手势的问题。生成模型会动态地增加在线数据，并用随机目标向量进行训练，鉴别模型决定数据的分类。该方法在UC2017 SG和UC2018 DualMyo数据集上得到了评估。使用距离度量瞄准生成和真实样本的差距来评估生成模型的性能；使用训练样本和未知样本上的准确率评估鉴别模型的性能。在样本的生成质量方面，所有类别的平均距离上，GAN生成的样本均明显优于随机分布（噪声）。在分类测试中，基准神经网络无法识别未训练的手势。当采用所提出的方法时，我们发现识别已训练手势和未训练手势之间存在权衡。",
