    "abstract": "To meet the growing need for computational power for DNNs, multiple specialized hardware architectures have been proposed. Each DNN layer should be mapped onto the hardware with the most efficient schedule, however, SotA schedulers struggle to consistently provide optimum schedules in a reasonable time across all DNN-HW combinations.  This paper proposes SALSA, a fast dual-engine scheduler to generate optimal execution schedules for both even and uneven mapping. We introduce a new strategy, combining exhaustive search with simulated annealing to address the dynamic nature of the loop ordering design space size across layers. SALSA is extensively benchmarked against two SotA schedulers, LOMA and Timeloop on 5 different DNNs, on average SALSA finds schedules with 11.9% and 7.6% lower energy while speeding up the search by 1.7x and 24x compared to LOMA and Timeloop, respectively.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了满足DNN计算需求的不断增长，已经提出了多种专用的硬件体系结构。每个DNN层应该映射到最有效的硬件上，然而，现有优化器往往无法在合理的时间内为所有DNN-HW组合提供最佳的执行计划。本文提出了SALSA，一种快速的双引擎调度器，用于生成均匀和非均匀映射的最优执行计划。我们介绍了一种新策略，将穷举搜索与模拟退火相结合，以应对不同层之间循环排序设计空间大小的动态变化。SALSA在5个不同的DNN上进行了广泛的基准测试，平均而言，与LOMA和Timeloop相比，SALSA在加速搜索的同时能够找到11.9％和7.6％更低的能量调度，分别提高了1.7倍和24倍。",
