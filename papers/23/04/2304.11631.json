    "translated_abstract": "随着图卷积网络（GCN）的发展，基于骨架的动作识别在人类动作识别方面取得了显著的成果。然而，最近的研究趋向于构建具有冗余训练的复杂学习机制，并存在长时间序列的瓶颈。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了Temporal-Spatio Graph ConvNeXt（TSGCNeXt）来探索长时间骨骼序列的高效学习机制。首先，我们提出了一个新的图形学习机制，动静分离多图卷积（DS-SMG），以汇集多个独立拓扑图的特征并避免节点信息在动态卷积期间被忽略。接下来，我们构建了一个图形卷积训练加速机制，以55.08％的速度提高动态图形学习的反向传播计算速度。最后，TSGCNeXt通过三个时空学习模块重新构建了GCN的整体结构，实现了更加高效的基于骨架的动作识别。",
