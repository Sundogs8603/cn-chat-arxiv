    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的在线评估协议，用于测试时间适应（TTA）方法，通过为较慢的方法提供更少的样本来惩罚它们。TTA方法利用测试时间的未标记数据来适应分布移位。虽然已经提出了许多有效的方法，但它们惊人的性能通常要以显着增加的计算预算为代价。当前的评估协议忽略了这种额外计算成本的影响，影响它们在实际中的适用性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种更加现实的TTA方法评估协议，在这个协议中数据以恒定速率从数据流中在线接收，从而考虑到方法的适应速度。我们将我们提出的协议应用于多个数据集和场景中对多种TTA方法进行基准测试。广泛的实验表明，在考虑推断速度时，简单快速的方法可以优于更复杂但较慢的方法。",
