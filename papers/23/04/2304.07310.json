    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has gained popularity in clinical research in recent years to facilitate privacy-preserving collaboration. Structured data, one of the most prevalent forms of clinical data, has experienced significant growth in volume concurrently, notably with the widespread adoption of electronic health records in clinical practice. This review examines FL applications on structured medical data, identifies contemporary limitations and discusses potential innovations. We searched five databases, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and CINAHL, to identify articles that applied FL to structured medical data and reported results following the PRISMA guidelines. Each selected publication was evaluated from three primary perspectives, including data quality, modeling strategies, and FL frameworks. Out of the 1160 papers screened, 34 met the inclusion criteria, with each article consisting of one or more studies that used FL to handle structured clinical/medical data. Of these",

    "translated_abstract": "在近年来的临床研究中，联邦学习（FL）已经在隐私保护协作方面获得了广泛的关注。随着电子健康记录在临床实践中的广泛应用，结构化数据作为最常见的临床数据形式之一，同时也经历了显着的增长。本研究检查了FL应用于结构化医学数据的应用，确定了当代的限制，并讨论了潜在的创新。我们在SCOPUS、MEDLINE、Web of Science、Embase和CINAHL等五个数据库中进行搜索，以识别将FL应用于结构化医学数据并根据PRISMA准则报告结果的文章。每篇选定的出版物从数据质量、建模策略和FL框架三个主要角度进行评估。经过筛选，34篇文章符合纳入标准，每篇文章包括一个或多个使用FL处理结构化临床/医学数据的研究。其中18个研究应用了FL来训练预测模型，而仅有2个研究调查了使用FL进行联邦迁移学习的应用。大多数研究集中在保护隐私方面，只有少数研究探索了FL的其他优点，如降低通信成本和提高模型通用性。本范围审查最后讨论了FL在结构化医疗数据背景下的挑战、限制和未来方向。",
    "tldr": "本研究是一份面向电子病历和结构化医疗数据的联邦与分布式学习应用的范围审查，研究发现FL应用于结构化医学数据的研究大多集中在隐私保护方面，未来应该探索FL在降低通信成本和提高模型通用性方面的应用。",
    "en_tdlr": "This scoping review examined the applications of federated and distributed learning on structured medical data, with a focus on privacy-preserving collaboration. The study found that most FL applications in the context of structured medical data focused on privacy preservation, and future research should explore other advantages of FL, such as reducing communication costs and improving model generalization."
