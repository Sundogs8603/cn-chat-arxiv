    "translated_abstract": "端到端的机器学习生命周期包含许多迭代过程，从数据准备和机器学习模型设计到模型训练，再到部署训练好的模型用于推理。当构建一个机器学习问题的端到端生命周期时，必须设计和执行许多机器学习管道，这会产生大量的生命周期版本。因此，本文介绍了VeML，一种专门用于端到端机器学习生命周期的版本管理系统。我们的系统解决了其他系统没有解决的几个关键问题。首先，我们解决了构建机器学习生命周期的高成本问题，特别是针对大规模和高维数据集。我们通过提议将在我们系统中管理的类似数据集的生命周期转移到新的训练数据来解决这个问题。我们设计了一种基于核心集的算法，可以有效地计算大规模高维数据的相似性。另一个关键问题是由于训练数据和测试数据的差异而导致模型准确性下降。我们开发了一种数据模式分析方法来检测先前使用的数据和新数据之间的差异。我们的系统使用户可以自定义机器学习生命周期工作流，并将生命周期的各个阶段与其API连接起来，作为用户运行自定义代码的桥梁。 VeML已应用于处理多个真实世界的机器学习问题，结果证明了我们的系统的有效性。",
