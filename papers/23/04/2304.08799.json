In this paper, we address self-supervised 3D action representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition. We investigate self-supervised representation learning and design a novel skeleton cloud colorization technique that is capable of learning spatial and temporal skeleton representations from unlabeled skeleton sequence data. We represent a skeleton action sequence as a 3D skeleton cloud and colorize each point in the cloud according to its temporal and spatial orders in the original (unannotated) skeleton sequence. Leveraging the colorized skeleton point cloud, we design an auto-encoder framework that can learn spatial-temporal features from the artificial color labels of skeleton joints effectively.
