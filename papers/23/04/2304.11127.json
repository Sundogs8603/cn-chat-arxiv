    "translated_abstract": "许多领域中最近的进展要求更加复杂的实验设计。这种复杂的实验通常有许多参数，需要参数调整。Tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) 是一种贝叶斯优化方法，在最近的参数调整框架中被广泛使用。尽管它很受欢迎，但控制参数的角色和算法直觉尚未得到讨论。在本教程中，我们将确定每个控制参数的作用以及它们对超参数优化的影响，使用多种基准测试。我们将从剖析研究中得出的推荐设置与基准方法进行比较，并证明我们的推荐设置提高了TPE的性能。我们的TPE实现可在https://github.com/nabenabe0928/tpe/tree/single-opt中获得。",
