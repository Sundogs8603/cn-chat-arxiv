However, existing datasets for monocular pose estimation do not adequately capture the challenging and dynamic nature of sports movements. In response, we introduce SportsPose, a large-scale 3D human pose dataset consisting of highly dynamic sports movements. With more than 176,000 3D poses from 24 different subjects performing 5 different sports activities, SportsPose provides a diverse and comprehensive set of 3D poses that reflect the complex and dynamic nature of sports movements. Contrary to other markerless datasets we have quantitatively evaluated the precision of SportsPose by comparing our poses with a commercial marker-based system and achieve a mean error of 34.5 mm across all evaluation sequences. This is comparable to the error reported on the commonly used 3DPW dataset. We further introduce a new metric, local movement, which describes the movement of the wrist and ankle ",

    "translated_abstract": "准确的三维人体姿势估计对于体育分析、教练和预防运动伤害至关重要。然而，现有的单目姿势估计数据集无法充分捕捉到运动动作的挑战性和动态性。为了解决这个问题，我们推出了SportsPose，一个大型的三维人体姿态数据集，包括高度动态的体育运动。SportsPose提供了超过176,000个来自24个不同受试者进行5种不同体育活动的3D姿态，提供了一个多样且全面的3D姿态集，反映了体育运动的复杂和动态性。与其他无标记数据集不同，我们通过将我们的姿态与商业标记系统进行比较来定量评估了SportsPose的精度，平均误差在所有评估序列中为34.5mm。这与常用的3DPW数据集报道的误差相当。我们还引入了一个新的度量标准，称为局部运动，它描述了手腕和踝关节的运动。",
