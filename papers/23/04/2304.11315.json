    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于深度学习的模型预测控制（MPC）算法，用于具有未知结构的不匹配和有界状态-动作相关不确定性的系统。我们利用深度神经网络（DNN）作为学习基础MPC（LBMPC）中的预言机，以估计不匹配的不确定性。由于实时估计其系数的技术困难，通常认为LBMPC难以使用非参数预言机，例如DNN。我们采用双时间尺度适应机制，在内部层以缓慢的时间尺度使用在线收集并有选择地存储在缓冲区中的训练数据进行训练，同时实时更新神经网络的最后一层的权重。我们通过对喷气发动机压缩系统模型的数值实验进行验证。这些结果表明，所提出的方法是可以实时实现的，并具有理论意义。",
