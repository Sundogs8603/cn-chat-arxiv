    "translated_abstract": "最近，自监督预训练策略在计算机视觉中训练通用特征提取骨干网络方面取得了显著的成果。结合Vision Transformer架构，DINO自蒸馏技术具有有趣的新兴特性，如潜在空间中的无监督聚类和生成特征的语义对应，而不需要使用显式的人工标注标签。无监督语义分割的STEGO方法通过对DINO预训练的Vision Transformer的特征对应进行对比蒸馏，最近创造了一个新的最优性。然而，STEGO的详细工作机制尚未得到分解，阻碍了它在安全关键应用中的使用。本文通过进行研究，揭示了STEGO架构和培训策略的工作机制，重现和扩展其实验证，以及研究STEGO在新领域中的应用能力。",
