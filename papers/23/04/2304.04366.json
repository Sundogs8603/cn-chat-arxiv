    "translated_abstract": "学习基于模型预测控制（MPC）的自动驾驶面临的一个主要问题是系统模型的预测精度和计算效率之间的矛盾。系统模型覆盖的情况越多，它就越复杂，并具有高度非线性和非凸性。这些问题使得优化过于复杂，无法实时控制。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种利用随机森林和线性回归的分层学习残差模型。学习到的模型由两个层级组成。低层使用线性回归拟合残差，高层使用随机森林切换不同的线性模型。同时，我们采用带有误差状态的线性动态自行车模型作为名义模型。将切换的线性回归模型添加到名义模型中形成系统模型。它将基于学习的MPC重构为一个二次规划（QP）问题，优化求解器可以轻松地解决它。我们的方法展示了比现有MPC方法更好的计算效率和预测精度。在真实世界的行驶场景中进行的大量实验表明，我们的方法可以处理各种复杂的城市和高速公路环境，并优于其他控制算法。",
