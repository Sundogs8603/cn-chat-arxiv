    "abstract": "Cybersecurity has emerged as a critical challenge for the industry. With the large complexity of the security landscape, sophisticated and costly deep learning models often fail to provide timely detection of cyber threats on edge devices. Brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) has been introduced as a promising solution to address this issue. However, existing HDC approaches use static encoders and require very high dimensionality and hundreds of training iterations to achieve reasonable accuracy. This results in a serious loss of learning efficiency and causes huge latency for detecting attacks. In this paper, we propose CyberHD, an innovative HDC learning framework that identifies and regenerates insignificant dimensions to capture complicated patterns of cyber threats with remarkably lower dimensionality. Additionally, the holographic distribution of patterns in high dimensional space provides CyberHD with notably high robustness against hardware errors.",

    "translated_abstract": "网络安全已经成为工业界面临的重大挑战。由于安全领域的复杂性，成本高昂的深度学习模型在边缘设备上往往无法及时检测到网络威胁。受脑启发的超维计算已被引入作为解决这个问题的一个很有前途的解决方案。但是，现有的超维计算方法使用静态编码器，需要极高的维度和数百次训练迭代才能达到合理的准确性。这导致了严重的学习效率损失，以及检测攻击时出现巨大的延迟。本文提出了一种创新的超维计算学习框架CyberHD，通过识别和再生不重要的维度，可以以显著更低的维度捕捉网络威胁的复杂模式。此外，高维空间中的全息分布为CyberHD提供了显著的硬件错误容错能力。",
