    "abstract": "In railway infrastructure, construction and maintenance is typically procured using competitive procedures such as auctions. However, these procedures only fulfill their purpose - using (taxpayers') money efficiently - if bidders do not collude. Employing a unique dataset of the Swiss Federal Railways, we present two methods in order to detect potential collusion: First, we apply machine learning to screen tender databases for suspicious patterns. Second, we establish a novel category-managers' tool, which allows for sequential and decentralized screening. To the best of our knowledge, we pioneer illustrating the adaption and application of machine-learning based price screens to a railway-infrastructure market.",

    "translated_abstract": "在铁路基础设施中，建设和维护通常使用竞争性程序（如拍卖）进行采购。然而，如果竞标者进行勾结，这些程序就无法实现效果–高效地利用纳税人的资金。本文提供了两种检测潜在勾结的方法：首先，我们应用机器学习技术来筛选标书数据库中的可疑模式；其次，我们建立了一种新型的类别经理工具，可用于顺序和分散式筛选。据我们所知，我们是第一个将基于机器学习的价格筛查方法应用于铁路基础设施市场，并对其进行改进的研究。",
