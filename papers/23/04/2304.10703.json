    "translated_abstract": "多步推理能力在许多自然语言任务中都是基础，但什么构成好的推理链以及如何评估它们尚不清楚。大多数现有方法仅关注推理链是否导致正确的结论，但这种以答案为导向的观点可能会将好的推理质量与其他用于预测答案的假捷径混淆。为了弥补这一差距，我们将推理链视为推导最终答案的非正式证明，通过评估推理链的两个关键特性——（1）正确性，即每个步骤基于步骤，前置步骤和输入上下文中包含的信息进行有效推理，以及（2）信息量，即每个步骤提供新信息有助于推导生成的答案——我们提出了ReCEval（推理链评估）框架。我们使用自然语言推理模型和信息理论测量实现了ReCEval。在多个数据集上的实验表明，我们的框架在评估推理链方面比现有方法更加客观、系统和准确。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a framework called ReCEval for evaluating reasoning chains based on correctness and informativeness, presenting a more objective and accurate way to evaluate multi-step reasoning ability. Experiments on multiple datasets show that ReCEval performs well in evaluating the quality of reasoning chains."
