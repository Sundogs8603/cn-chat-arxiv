    "translated_abstract": "最近，大规模生成模型在以文本为引导的高保真图像的生成方面取得了前所未有的性能。当引导信息包含用户定义的、未见过的或长尾概念标记时，文本反转成为一种有效的个性化生成技术。尽管如此，我们发现并展示了文本反转的部署仍充满了“黑魔法”，例如额外数据集的严苛要求，在循环中需要艰苦的人力成本和缺乏鲁棒性等。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为可控文本反转的大大增强版反转，解决了所有上述问题，并反过来提供了一个强大，数据效率高，易于使用的框架。COTI的核心是基于理论的损失目标，具有全面和新颖的加权评分机制，并由主动学习范式所提取。广泛的结果表明，COTI的性能比之前技术有了显著的提升，尤其是在数据少的情况下。",
