    "translated_abstract": "将单词映射到固定维度的向量空间的单词嵌入是现代自然语言处理的基础。大多数单词嵌入方法编码语义信息。但是，对于某些任务非常重要的语音信息经常被忽略。在这项工作中，我们开发了几种新方法，利用发声特征构建语音知情单词嵌入，并提供一套语音单词嵌入以鼓励其社区的开发、评估和使用。虽然已经存在许多学习语音单词嵌入的方法，但在评估其有效性方面缺乏一致性。因此，我们还提出了几种评估语音单词嵌入的内在方面的方法，如单词检索和与声音相似性的相关性，以及外在表现，如韵律和同源检测和声音类比。我们希望我们的任务套件将促进可重复性并提供未来语音单词嵌入研究的方向。",
