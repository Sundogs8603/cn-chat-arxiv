    "translated_abstract": "从视觉丰富的文档中提取信息是一项具有挑战性的任务，由于其在几个基于文档控制的应用程序中的重要性和其广泛的商业价值，近年来越来越受到关注。迄今为止，在这个主题上进行的大部分研究工作都遵循两步法。首先，他们使用现成的光学字符识别（OCR）引擎读取文本，然后从所获得的文本中提取感兴趣的字段。这些方法的主要缺点是它们依赖于外部OCR系统，这可能会对性能和计算速度产生负面影响。最近，出现了一些无OCR方法来解决上述问题。受到其有希望的结果的启示，我们在本文中提出一种名为DocParser的OCR-free端到端信息提取模型。它通过其更好地提取判别性字符特征的能力不同于先前的端到端方法。DocParser在视觉丰富的文档数据集上实现了最新的结果，超过了依赖于OCR引擎的先前方法。",
