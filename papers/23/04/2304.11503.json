    "translated_abstract": "客户流失指终止与企业的关系或在特定期间减少客户参与。由于获取新客户的成本可能是保留现有客户成本的五到六倍，因此在有流失风险的客户上进行投资是明智的。客户流失模型的因果分析可以预测客户在可预见的未来是否会流失，并确定导致流失的效果和可能的原因。本研究提出了一个概念框架，以发现与独立变量相关且与影响流失的因变量因果相关的混淆特征。我们结合了不同的算法，包括SMOTE、集成ANN和贝叶斯网络，以解决在金融机构中生成的大规模和高维金融数据的客户流失预测问题，这些数据通常由客户关系管理系统中使用的基于区间的特征产生。还评估了维度诅咒和维度的福音效应。",
