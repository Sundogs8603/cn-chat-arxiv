In this paper, we use datasets from pristine models without considering the degrading effects of hysteretic systems as low-fidelity representations that capture many of the important characteristics of the true system's behavior to train a deep operator network (DeepONet). Three numerical examples are used to show that the proposed use of the DeepONets to model the discrepancies between the low-fidelity model and the true system's response leads to significant improvements in the prediction error in the presence of uncertainty in the model parameters for degrading hysteretic systems.",
