Both terms in the underlying NCE loss, the one using data samples and the one using noise samples, can be lower-bounded as in variational Bayes, therefore we call this family of losses fully variational noise-contrastive estimation. Variational autoencoders are a particular example in this family and therefore can be also understood as separating real data from synthetic samples using an appropriate classification loss. We further discuss other instances in this family of fully variational NCE objectives and indicate differences in their empirical behavior.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文利用适当评分规则的基本理论，设计了一族可用于潜变量模型的噪声对比估计（NCE）方法。这些方法可以将噪声和数据样本的对比损失函数分别下界为变分贝叶斯中的相应项，因此我们称这个损失函数族为全变分噪声对比估计。其中一个特例是变分自编码器，因此也可以理解为通过适当的分类损失将真实数据与合成样本分离开来。我们进一步讨论了全变分NCE目标函数族中的其他例子，并指出它们在实证行为上的差异。",
