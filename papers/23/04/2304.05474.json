    "translated_abstract": "在视频平台上，针对新节目进行受众定位和扩展的关键在于如何生成它们的嵌入。应该从用户和节目的角度进行个性化处理。此外，为了追求即时（点击）和长期（观看时间）奖励，以及新节目的冷启动问题，带来了额外的挑战。这种问题适合通过异构图模型进行处理，因为数据具有自然的图结构。但是现实世界中的网络通常具有数十亿个节点和各种类型的边缘。很少有现有方法专注于处理大规模数据并利用不同类型的边缘，特别是后者。本文提出了一种基于边缘触发的异构图网络的两阶段受众扩展方案，可以考虑不同的双面交互和特征。在离线阶段，选择用户ID和显示器的特定边缘信息组合来构建图形。",
