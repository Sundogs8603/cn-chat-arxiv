    "abstract": "Given an unknown dynamical system, what is the minimum number of samples needed for effective learning of its governing laws and accurate prediction of its future evolution behavior, and how to select these critical samples? In this work, we propose to explore this problem based on a design approach. Starting from a small initial set of samples, we adaptively discover critical samples to achieve increasingly accurate learning of the system evolution. One central challenge here is that we do not know the network modeling error since the ground-truth system state is unknown, which is however needed for critical sampling. To address this challenge, we introduce a multi-step reciprocal prediction network where forward and backward evolution networks are designed to learn the temporal evolution behavior in the forward and backward time directions, respectively. Very interestingly, we find that the desired network modeling error is highly correlated with the multi-step reciprocal prediction ",
