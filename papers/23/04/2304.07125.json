    "abstract": "Having an intelligent dialogue agent that can engage in conversational question answering (ConvQA) is now no longer limited to Sci-Fi movies only and has, in fact, turned into a reality. These intelligent agents are required to understand and correctly interpret the sequential turns provided as the context of the given question. However, these sequential questions are sometimes left implicit and thus require the resolution of some natural language phenomena such as anaphora and ellipsis. The task of question rewriting has the potential to address the challenges of resolving dependencies amongst the contextual turns by transforming them into intent-explicit questions. Nonetheless, the solution of rewriting the implicit questions comes with some potential challenges such as resulting in verbose questions and taking conversational aspect out of the scenario by generating self-contained questions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, CONVSR (CONVQA using Structured Representations)",

    "translated_abstract": "拥有一个能够参与对话式问答（ConvQA）的智能对话代理现在已不仅仅局限于科幻电影，并且已经成为现实。这些智能代理需要理解和正确解释作为给定问题背景的顺序转换。然而，这些顺序的问题有时会被留下隐含的，因此需要解决一些自然语言现象，例如指代和省略。对问题重写的任务有潜力通过将它们转换成明确意图的问题来解决解决上下文转换之间依赖关系的挑战。然而，重写隐式问题的解决方案存在一些潜在的挑战，例如生成冗长的问题并通过生成自包含问题的方式使对话中的情境削弱了。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的框架CONVSR（使用结构化表示的CONVQA）。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一个名为CONVSR的框架，可以在不影响对话性质的同时，使用结构化表示解决对话式问答中的依赖关系问题。"
