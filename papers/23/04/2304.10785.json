    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个概念性模型，用于预测自然语言生成对话系统中的聊天体验。我们使用部分最小二乘结构方程建模方法（PLS-SEM）对120名参与者进行了评估，并获得了0.541的R方值。该模型考虑了多种因素，包括用于生成的提示、对话中的连贯性、情感和相似性，以及用户对话代理的好感度。我们进一步探讨了我们提出的模型子集的有效性。结果显示，用户的好感度和对话中的连贯性、情感和相似性是用户聊天体验的正向预测因素。此外，我们发现用户可能更喜欢具有外向性、开放性、责任心、宜人性和非神经质特征的对话代理。通过我们的研究，自适应对话系统可以使用收集到的数据来推断我们模型中的因素，并通过调整对话代理的特征来预测用户的聊天体验。",
