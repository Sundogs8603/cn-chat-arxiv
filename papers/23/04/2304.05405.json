    "abstract": "In the past few years, Differentiable Neural Architecture Search (DNAS) rapidly imposed itself as the trending approach to automate the discovery of deep neural network architectures. This rise is mainly due to the popularity of DARTS, one of the first major DNAS methods. In contrast with previous works based on Reinforcement Learning or Evolutionary Algorithms, DNAS is faster by several orders of magnitude and uses fewer computational resources. In this comprehensive survey, we focus specifically on DNAS and review recent approaches in this field. Furthermore, we propose a novel challenge-based taxonomy to classify DNAS methods. We also discuss the contributions brought to DNAS in the past few years and its impact on the global NAS field. Finally, we conclude by giving some insights into future research directions for the DNAS field.",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的几年中，不同iable神经架构搜索（DNAS）迅速成为自动发现深度神经网络结构的流行方法。 这种崛起主要归功于DARTS，这是第一个重要的DNAS方法之一。 与基于强化学习或进化算法的以前的作品相比，DNAS速度快了数个数量级，并且使用的计算资源更少。 在这篇全面的综述中，我们专门关注DNAS并审查了该领域的最新方法。 此外，我们提出了一种基于挑战的分类法来分类DNAS方法。 我们还讨论了过去几年对DNAS带来的贡献以及其对全球NAS领域的影响。 最后，我们通过提供一些未来研究方向的见解来做出结论。",
