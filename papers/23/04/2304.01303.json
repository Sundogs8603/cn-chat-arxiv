In this paper, we present a new lower bound for parallel tempering on the spectral gap that has a polynomial dependence on all parameters except $\\log L$, where $(L + 1)$ is the number of levels.

    "translated_abstract": "在采样算法领域中，当直接采样不可行时，MCMC（马尔科夫链蒙特卡罗）方法被广泛使用。然而，目标分布的多模态通常导致收敛速度缓慢和混合不佳。一种常见的解决方案是并行退火。尽管其在实践中非常有效，但其性能的理论保证有限。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的关于并行退火谱间隙的下界，其对除$\\log L$之外的所有参数具有多项式依赖性，其中$(L + 1)$是级数的数量。这改进了现有界限，其与模态数呈指数关系。此外，我们用谱间隙的假设上界来补充我们的结果，其对$\\log L$具有指数依赖性，这表明在某种意义上，我们的界限是紧密的。",
