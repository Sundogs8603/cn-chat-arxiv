    "translated_abstract": "本报告讨论了社会经济软物质(SE-SM)的出现，它是物理学和经济学相互作用的结果。首先，使用软物质科学工具测试自工业革命以来的人口变化，支持创新的基于衍生品和失真敏感分析工具。结果显示呈Weibull类型的幂次指数增长，自1970年代以来上升速度显著降低。随后，对Rapa Nui（复活岛）模型案例和四个大型“标志性城市”进行了人口模式测试，其中包括美国的底特律和克利夫兰以及波兰的洛茨（前纺织工业中心）和比托姆（前煤炭采矿中心）。分析明确揭示了受历史和社会经济背景以及人口变化的长期决定主义影响的人口变化的缩放模式。通用性的数据表明：人类活动出现规模效应。",
