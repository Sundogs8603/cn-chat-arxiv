    "translated_abstract": "随着要求提高透明度，政府在多个领域包括财政、教育和医疗保健方面发布了更多的数据。有效地探索医疗保健数据构成了一个重大挑战。公共卫生的关键问题包括快速识别和分析趋势以及检测异常值。这可以快速调整政策以应对变化的情况。我们提出了一种有效的异常值检测技术，称为 PIKS（基于修剪的迭代 K 均值亮点搜索），它将迭代 k 均值算法与修剪搜索亮点扫描相结合。我们将此技术应用于识别两个公开可用的医疗保健数据集：纽约州全面规划和研究合作系统和加利福尼亚州全面卫生规划和发展厅。我们将我们的技术与三种现有的异常值检测技术（包括自编码器、孤立森林和深度自回归网络）进行比较，结果表明，在效率和准确性方面，PIKS优于其他技术。我们进一步通过纽约州数据集的案例研究展示了PIKS识别可操作趋势的实用性。",
