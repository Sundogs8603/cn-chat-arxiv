This paper investigates the use of latent semantic dimensions as fingerprints, from where we can analyze the effects of design variables, including the choice of fingerprinting dimensions, strength, and capacity, on the accuracy-quality tradeoff.

    "translated_abstract": "生成模型使得产生的内容难以区分是否源于自然环境。这种模型的开源开发引起了对于其被恶意利用的担忧。其中一个潜在的风险缓解策略是通过指纹追溯生成模型。然而，现有的指纹追溯方法在追溯准确性与生成质量之间存在明显的权衡，并且缺乏改善这种权衡的设计原则。本文研究了使用潜在语义维度作为指纹的方法，通过该方法可以分析设计变量对于准确性-质量权衡的影响，包括指纹维度的选择、强度和容量。相比之前的 SOTA，我们的方法需要最少的计算，并且更适用于大规模模型。我们使用 StyleGAN2 和潜在扩散模型展示了我们方法的功效。",
