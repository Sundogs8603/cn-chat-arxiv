    "translated_abstract": "尽管金纳米棒已经成为研究的热点，但控制它们的形状，从而控制它们的光学特性的途径仍然很大程度上是基于经验的。尽管合成过程中不同试剂物之间的共存和相互作用控制着这些特性，但在实践中，探索合成空间的计算和实验方法可能会极其繁琐或耗费过多时间。因此，我们提出了一种利用科学文献中已经包含的大量合成信息来自动化提取相关结构化数据的方法，以高通量方式探寻金纳米棒种子介导生长过程以及结果。为此，我们使用强大的GPT-3语言模型提出了一种方法，来从非结构化科学文本中提取金纳米棒的结构化多步种子介导生长过程和结果。将GPT-3的提示完成进行微调，以预测JSON文档形式的合成模板。",
