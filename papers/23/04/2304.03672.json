    "translated_abstract": "质量多样性(QD)算法旨在在给定描述符空间中生成优秀解决方案的集合并最大化它们的多样性。然而，在存在不可预测的噪音的情况下，同一解决方案在不同评估中的适应度和描述符可能会有显著差异，导致估计这些值存在不确定性。鉴于QD算法的精英主义本质，在这些嘈杂的环境下，它们通常会得到许多退化的解决方案。在本文中，我们介绍了“档案可重现性改进算法”(ARIA)；一种即插即用的方法，它可以提高存档中存在的解决方案的可重现性。我们将其提议为一种单独的优化模块，依赖于自然进化策略，可以在任何QD算法的顶部执行。我们的模块对解决方案进行变异，以(1)优化其属于自己的领域的概率，和(2)最大化它们的适应度。我们的方法的性能在各种任务上进行了评估，包括...",
