    "translated_abstract": "本文针对协变量自适应随机化（CAR）中的因果推断使用回归调整（RA）时存在的权衡进行了研究。RA可以通过整合未用于随机分配的协变量信息来提高因果估计器的效率。但是，当回归器数量与样本量同阶时，RA的估计误差不能渐近忽略，会降低估计效率。没有考虑RA成本的结果可能导致在零假设下过度拒绝因果推断。为了解决这个问题，我们在CAR下为经过回归调整的平均处理效应（ATE）估计器开发了一种统一的推断理论。我们的理论具有两个关键特征：（1）确保在零假设下的精确渐近大小，无论协变量数量是固定还是最多以样本大小的速度发散，（2）确保在协变量维度方面都比未调整的估计器弱效提高.",
