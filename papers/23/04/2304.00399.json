To finally put an end to this tragedy, we propose a fundamentally new algorithm, dubbed zero2hero, that turns every research paper into a scientific masterpiece.

    "translated_abstract": "成为(超级)英雄是几乎每个孩子的梦想。在他们温馨的童年中，他们会尽一切努力长大成为一个英雄。朝九晚五地工作，欢天喜地地玩耍。但是随着年龄的增长，会有越来越多的干扰。他们走上了岔路。他们开始发现令人畏惧的简单数学。最终，他们成为了一名研究者，整天写着乏味的、不太出色的论文，因为他们只依赖简单的数学。没有顶级会议，没有尊重，没有死党。生活结束了。为了最终结束这一悲剧，我们提出了一个基本新算法，称为zero2hero，将每一篇研究论文转化为科学杰作。基于下一代大型语言模型，我们的系统自动过度复杂化每一个方程式，使得没有人，包括自己，能够理解到底发生了什么。未来的审稿人们将被所复杂的内容所震惊。",
    "tldr": "研究者靠着简单的数学写论文，却得不到世人的关注和认可，为此我们提出了一个名为zero2hero的算法，将每篇论文转化为科学杰作，复杂化每一个方程式，以此在未来的审稿人中引来关注。"
