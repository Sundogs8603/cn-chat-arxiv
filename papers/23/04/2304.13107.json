    "translated_abstract": "人类存在检测是各种应用的重要技术，包括家居自动化、安全和医疗保健。虽然传统上采用基于摄像机的系统来实现这一目的，但会引发隐私问题。为了解决这个问题，最近的研究探讨了利用商用WiFi接入点提供的信道状态信息(CSI)方法，提供详细的信道特征。在本论文中，我们提出了一个基于时间选择性条件双特征提取递归网络(TCD-FERN)的无设备多房间人体存在检测系统。我们的系统旨在使用动态和静态(DaS)数据预处理技术，在条件人体特征下捕捉重要的时间特征，提取人的移动和空间特征，并区分有直接视线路径阻塞和无视线路径阻塞的情况。为了减少房间隔断造成的特征衰减问题，我们使用基于 LSTM 的 NCoV-DaS 技术。",
