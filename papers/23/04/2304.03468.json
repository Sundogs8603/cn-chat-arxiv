    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱（KG）应用的发展导致了需要从各种来源提取的异构KG之间的实体对齐（EA）的不断增长需求。近来，由于GNN的出色结构信息捕捉能力，在EA任务中广泛采用GNN。然而，我们观察到现有常见EA数据集的过于简单化的设置与现实场景相距甚远，这妨碍了对最近方法所取得进展的全面理解。这种现象使我们深思：现有基于GNN的EA方法是否真的取得了伟大进展？为了研究EA方法在现实情况下的性能，本文聚焦于高度异构的KG（HHKG）（例如，事件KG和通用KG）的对齐，这些KG在规模和结构上不同，并共享更少的重叠实体。首先，我们清理了不合理的设置，并提出了两个新的HHKG数据集，其密切地模拟了现实世界场景。",
