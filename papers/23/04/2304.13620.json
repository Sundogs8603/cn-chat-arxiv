    "translated_abstract": "自动将图表转换为文本摘要是视障人士的有效工具，同时为用户提供表格数据的自然语言精确洞察力。大型、结构良好的数据集始终是数据驱动模型的关键部分。本文提出了ChartSumm：一个大规模基准数据集，包括共84363个图表及其元数据和描述，涵盖广泛的主题和图表类型，可生成长短摘要。强基线模型的广泛实验表明，尽管这些模型通过实现各种自动评估指标的得分来生成流畅且信息丰富的摘要，但它们经常遇到一些问题，例如产生错觉，漏掉重要的数据点，以及不正确地解释图表中的复杂趋势。我们还通过自动翻译工具探讨了将ChartSumm扩展到其他语言的潜力。这使得我们的数据集成为一个有挑战的任务。",
