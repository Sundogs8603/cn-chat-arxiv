    "translated_abstract": "时间知识图谱推理旨在基于历史信息预测未来的丢失事实，并近年来引起了越来越多的研究兴趣。大量工作已经致力于模拟推理任务的历史结构和时间特征。然而，大规模的真实场景下的TKG实体数量相当可观，随着时间的推移，会出现越来越多的新实体。因此，我们提出了一种新的架构，用于建模TKG的关系特征，即aDAptivE path-MemOry Network（DaeMon），它能够自适应地模拟查询主题与每个对象候选之间的时间路径信息。它可以在不依赖实体表达的情况下模拟历史信息。具体来说，DaeMon使用路径内存记录从时间轴上的路径汇聚单元得到的时间路径信息，考虑每条路径的顺序和权重，并使用注意机制选择性地集成记忆。在两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明了我们方法的有效性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel architecture, DaeMon, for adaptively modeling the temporal path information between query subject and each object candidate in TKG by recording the temporal path information and selectively integrating memories with attention mechanism. The method overcomes the challenge of the considerable and increasing number of TKG entities and does not rely on entity representation. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."
