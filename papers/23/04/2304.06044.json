As a result, the trained network not only satisfies all thermodynamic constraints but also instantly provides information about the current material state (i.e., free energy, stress, and the evolution of internal variables) under any given loading scenario without requiring initial data. One advantage of this work is that it bypasses the repetitive Newton iterations needed to solve nonlinear equations in complex material models. Additionally, strategies are provided to reduce the required order of derivation for obtaining the tangent operator. The trained model can be directly used in any finite element package (or other numerical methods) as a user-defined material model. However, challenges remain in the proper definition of collocation points and in integrating several non-equality constraints that become active or non-active simultaneously. We tested this",

    "translated_abstract": "我们使用物理训练的神经网络来解决非线性、路径相关材料行为的本构关系。训练好的网络不仅满足所有热力学约束，而且在任何给定的加载情况下，立即提供关于当前材料状态（即自由能，应力和内部变量的演变）的信息，而不需要初始数据。这项工作的一个优点是它规避了求解复材料模型中非线性方程所需的重复牛顿迭代。此外，我们提供了减少获取切向算子所需的导数次序的策略。训练好的模型可以直接用作任何有限元程序（或其他数值方法）中的用户定义材料模型。然而，在定义配点和整合同时激活或非激活的多个非相等约束方面仍存在挑战。",
