    "translated_abstract": "数据评估是一个强大的框架，可以为模型训练提供统计洞察力，以区分哪些数据对于模型训练是有益的，哪些是有害的。纵观各种下游任务，许多以Shapley为基础的数据价值评估方法均显示出了很有前途的结果。然而，由于这需要训练大量的模型，因此众所周知，这是具有挑战性的。因此，将此应用于大型数据集是不可行的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了Data-OOB，这是一种新的数据价值估计方法，针对bagging模型，它利用了out-of-bag估计。所提出的方法在计算上是高效的，可以通过重复使用训练好的弱学习器来扩展到数百万个数据。具体而言，当评估100个输入维度且存在$10^6$个样本时，Data-OOB仅需要在单个CPU处理器上执行不到2.25个小时。此外，Data-OOB在理论上有坚实的解释，当两个离差值函数相同时，其识别具有相同重要性的数据点。",
