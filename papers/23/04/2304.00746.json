    "translated_abstract": "历史手稿处理面临有限的注释训练数据和新类别出现等挑战。为解决这一问题，我们提出了一种基于单次学习的文本检测方法 OTS，通过仅一个注释样本，准确可靠地检测出新颖字符。灵感源自认知研究，引入空间对齐模块，基于一个支持图像发现、关注和学习查询图像中最具有区别性的空间区域。尤其是，针对低资源检测任务通常面临样本不平衡问题，我们提出了一种名为“环形损失”的新型损失函数，可以使距离度量的嵌入空间更具有区分性。该方法高效，只需要少量的训练样本，具有处理新颖字符和符号的显著能力。为了增强数据集的多样性，我们创建了一个包含古代东巴象形文字（DBH）的手稿数据集。",
