    "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) aims at enhancing the performance and efficiency of machine learning models by training them on multiple tasks simultaneously. However, MTL research faces two challenges: 1) modeling the relationships between tasks to effectively share knowledge between them, and 2) jointly learning task-specific and shared knowledge. In this paper, we present a novel model Adaptive Task-to-Task Fusion Network (AdaTT) to address both challenges. AdaTT is a deep fusion network built with task specific and optional shared fusion units at multiple levels. By leveraging a residual mechanism and gating mechanism for task-to-task fusion, these units adaptively learn shared knowledge and task specific knowledge. To evaluate the performance of AdaTT, we conduct experiments on a public benchmark and an industrial recommendation dataset using various task groups. Results demonstrate AdaTT can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "多任务学习旨在通过同时在多个任务上训练机器学习模型来提高性能和效率。然而，多任务学习面临两个挑战：1）对任务之间的关系进行建模，以有效地共享知识；2）联合学习任务特定和共享知识。本文介绍了一种新型的自适应任务融合网络（AdaTT）来解决这两个挑战。AdaTT是一个深度融合网络，在多个级别上使用任务特定和可选共享融合单元构建。通过利用残差机制和门控机制实现任务之间的融合，这些单元自适应地学习共享知识和任务特定知识。为了评估AdaTT的性能，我们在公共基准测试集和工业级推荐数据集上使用不同的任务组进行实验。结果表明，AdaTT可以显著优于现有的最先进基线模型。",
