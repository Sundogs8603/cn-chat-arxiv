    "translated_abstract": "随着技术的不断演进，消费电子产品（如电视、机顶盒、家庭影院和空调）的使用在现代社会变得越来越普遍。随着每年新设备的进入，操作它们需要多个红外线遥控器的累积不仅浪费能源和资源，而且为用户创造了繁琐和混乱的环境。本文提出了一种名为SimplyMime的新型系统，旨在消除消费电子产品需要多个遥控器的需求，为用户提供直观的控制方式，而不需要额外的设备。SimplyMime利用了一种动态手势识别体系结构，融合了人工智能和人机交互，创建出一种先进的系统，使用户能够轻松地与绝大多数消费电子产品进行交互。此外，SimplyMime还具有安全性方面的功能，可以验证和认证设备。",
