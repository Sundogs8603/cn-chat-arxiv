    "translated_abstract": "机器学习和深度学习领域的显著进展使得高度逼真的虚假媒体——Deepfake（深度伪造）的出现成为可能。Deepfake是通过复杂的人工智能生成的虚假媒体，有时很难与真实媒体区分。到目前为止，这种媒体可以上传到各种社交媒体平台，因此宣传变得容易，这需要采取有效的对策。因此，对Deepfake的乐观对策之一将是Deepfake检测。为了对付这一威胁，过去的研究人员基于卷积神经网络等机器学习和深度学习技术创建了检测Deepfake的模型。本文旨在探索不同的方法，以实现具有更高准确性的成本有效模型，并使用不同类型的数据集来解决数据集的泛化问题。",
