    "translated_abstract": "许多应用需要将包含在各种文档数据集中的实例分组成类。最广泛使用的方法不使用深度学习，也不利用文档固有的多模态性质。值得注意的是，记录链接通常被概念化为字符串匹配问题。本研究开发了 CLIPPINGS，一种用于记录链接的多模态框架。CLIPPINGS 采用端到端训练对称的视觉和语言双编码器，通过对比语言-图像预训练进行对齐，学习一个度量空间，其中给定实例的汇总图像-文本表示靠近同一类中的表示，并远离不同类中的表示。在推理时，可以通过从离线示例嵌入索引中检索它们最近的邻居或聚类它们的表示来链接实例。本研究研究了两个具有挑战性的应用：通过将专利与其对应的监管文件链接来构建全面的补充专利注册表，以及在不同的社交媒体平台上识别个人。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a multimodal framework called CLIPPINGS for record linkage, which utilizes deep learning and contrastive learning to learn representations in a metric space through end-to-end training of symmetric vision and language encoders. It can be used for various challenging applications, such as constructing comprehensive supplemental patent registers and identifying individuals across different social media platforms."
