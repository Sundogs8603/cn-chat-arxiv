Many concepts, including the long-existing core and other stability notions more recently proposed by Yang \\cite{Y22}, can all be re-cast in this fractional mode. The latter allows a certain ranking between games, which we deem as in the sense of ``centripetality'', to imply a clearly describable shift in the games' stable solutions. %These trends would be preserved after the imposition of the restriction that fractions be positive as well. When coalitions' values are built on both random outcomes and a common positively homogeneous reward function characterizing players' enjoyments from their shares, the above link could help explain why aversion to risk often promotes cooperation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了具有严格正值价值的集体博弈。这种博弈的个人理性分配有清晰的分数解释。许多概念，包括长期存在的核心以及最近由Yang提出的其他稳定概念，都可以在这种分数模式下重新表述。后一种模式允许在游戏之间进行某种排序，我们认为这是“向心性”的意义，可以推导出游戏稳定解的明显可描述的偏移。当集合的价值既建立在随机结果上，又建立在一个表示玩家享受其份额的共同正齐次奖励函数上时，上述联系可以帮助解释为什么对风险的厌恶经常促进合作。",
