    "abstract": "We address an important gap in detection of political bias in news articles. Previous works that perform supervised document classification can be biased towards the writing style of each news outlet, leading to overfitting and limited generalizability. Our approach overcomes this limitation by considering both the sentence-level semantics and the document-level rhetorical structure, resulting in a more robust and style-agnostic approach to detecting political bias in news articles. We introduce a novel multi-head hierarchical attention model that effectively encodes the structure of long documents through a diverse ensemble of attention heads. While journalism follows a formalized rhetorical structure, the writing style may vary by news outlet. We demonstrate that our method overcomes this domain dependency and outperforms previous approaches for robustness and accuracy.

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对新闻文章中政治偏见检测方面的重要差距进行研究。先前进行监督式文档分类的工作可能会偏向各网站的写作风格，导致过拟合和有限的普适性。我们的方法通过考虑句子级语义和文档级修辞结构来克服这一限制，从而产生一种更强大和不受风格影响的检测政治偏见的方法。我们引入了一种新颖的多头分层注意力模型，通过各种注意力头的不同集合有效地编码长文档的结构。我们展示了我们的方法克服了这种域依赖性，并表现出比先前方法更好的鲁棒性和准确性。进一步的分析表明，我们的模型能够捕捉到新闻中常用的话语结构。",
