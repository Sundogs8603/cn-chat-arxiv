    "abstract": "Researchers regard crime as a social phenomenon that is influenced by several physical, social, and economic factors. Different types of crimes are said to have different motivations. Theft, for instance, is a crime that is based on opportunity, whereas murder is driven by emotion. In accordance with this, we examine how well a model can perform with only spatiotemporal information at hand when it comes to predicting a single crime. More specifically, we aim at predicting theft, as this is a crime that should be predictable using spatiotemporal information. We aim to answer the question: \"How well can we predict theft using spatial and temporal features?\". To answer this question, we examine the effectiveness of support vector machines, linear regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, and k-nearest neighbours, using different imbalanced techniques and hyperparameters. XGBoost showed the best results with an F1-score of 0.86.",

    "translated_abstract": "研究者认为，犯罪是受到多种物理、社会和经济因素影响的社会现象。不同类型的犯罪据说有不同的动机。例如，盗窃是一种基于机会的犯罪，而谋杀是出于情感驱动的。因此，我们考察了当预测单一犯罪时，仅使用时空信息时模型的表现。具体来说，我们旨在预测盗窃，因为这是一种可以使用时空信息进行预测的犯罪。我们的研究问题是：“我们能用空间和时间特征来预测盗窃的表现如何？”为了回答这个问题，我们使用不同的不平衡技术和超参数，考察了支持向量机、线性回归、XGBoost、随机森林和k-最近邻等方法的有效性。XGBoost表现最佳，F1分数为0.86。",
