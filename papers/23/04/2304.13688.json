    "translated_abstract": "AI系统的颠覆性潜力源于大数据的出现，但是很大一部分数据分散在数据孤岛中，其潜力未能得到释放。联邦机器学习是一种新的人工智能范式，可以从分散的、潜在的数据孤岛中创建AI模型。因此，联邦机器学习在技术上可以打开数据孤岛，从而释放经济潜力。然而，这需要多个拥有数据孤岛的方之间的合作。建立合作业务模式是复杂的，通常是失败的原因。当前的文献缺乏成功实现合作AI项目所必须考虑的指南。本研究通过系统文献回顾、焦点小组和专家访谈，探讨了当前合作业务模式的挑战和联邦机器学习的不同方面。我们提供了一个系统化的社会技术挑战和扩展的业务模式，以实现联邦机器学习项目。",
