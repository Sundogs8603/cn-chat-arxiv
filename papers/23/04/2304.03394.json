    "translated_abstract": "对于教育工作者和管理者来说，学生对课程的反馈意见非常重要，无论课程的类型或机构如何。在机构级别或在线论坛上处理大量的开放反馈变得不可行。在本文中，我们收集和预处理了大量公开可用的课程评论。我们应用机器学习技术，目的是了解学生的情感和主题。具体而言，我们利用了当前的自然语言处理技术，如词嵌入和深度神经网络，并采用最先进的BERT（双向编码器表示来自变压器）、RoBERTa（经过优化的BERT方法）和XLNet（广义自回归预训练）技术。我们进行了广泛的实验，比较了这些技术与传统方法的差异。这项比较研究展示了如何应用现代机器学习方法进行情感极性分析和主题分类。",
