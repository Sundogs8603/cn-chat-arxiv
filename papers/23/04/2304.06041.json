    "translated_abstract": "下一代汽车通过创新解决方案智能评估车辆驾驶安全。这项安全驾驶监测可以使用许多在科学文献中广泛讨论的方法来实现。在这种情况下，作者提出了一种创新方法，使用特定的生物传感系统来重构汽车驾驶员的生理注意力状态。为了重构汽车驾驶员的生理状态，作者提出了使用生物传感探针的方法，该探针由近红外(NiR)光谱下的耦合LED和光电检测器组成。该探针放置在被监测的对象上，可以检测到一种称为光电容积描记(PPG)的生理信号。PPG信号的形成由被监测对象血液中氧合和非氧合血红蛋白浓度的变化调节，这将直接与由自主神经系统(ANS)调节的心脏活动相连接。通过深度学习系统处理和分析获得的PPG信号，可以识别出与驾驶员注意力水平一致的特定模式。",
