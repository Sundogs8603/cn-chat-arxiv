    "translated_abstract": "创新的电子设计自动化（EDA）解决方案对于满足越来越复杂的电子设备的设计要求至关重要。 Verilog是一种广泛用于数字电路设计和验证的硬件描述语言，并使用特定的EDA工具进行合成。然而，编写代码是一项重复且耗时的任务。本文首先提出了一种新颖的深度学习框架，用于训练Verilog自动完成模型，其次提供了从开源存储库获取的Verilog数据集。该框架涉及将预先训练的模型集成到通用编程语言数据上，然后在相似于目标下游任务的数据集上进行微调。通过比较在多个评估指标上训练不同子集的预训练模型与提议的Verilog数据集，验证了该方法的有效性。实验表明，该框架相比基线模型实现了更好的BLEU，ROUGE-L和chrF得分，并且有效预测了部分编写的Verilog语句的下一个token。",
