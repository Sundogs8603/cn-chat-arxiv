    "translated_abstract": "随着自然语言理解和生成系统的发展，对话系统已被广泛应用于语言学习和练习。许多当前的教育对话系统进行闲聊，生成内容和词汇不受限制。然而，在学校环境中，如果对话符合学生的课程设置并侧重于课本词汇，则通过对话实践更为有效。因此，我们调整了一种具有词汇限制解码的对话系统，促使对话系统在生成语言时包含与课程相关的词汇和短语。我们采用生成对话系统BlenderBot3作为我们的主模型，并对学习英语作为第二语言的中学生进行课程设置的对话系统进行评估。限制的单词和短语来自他们的课本，并由他们的英语老师建议。评估结果表明，具有课程信息的对话系统可以与学生产生更有效和吸引人的对话，准确使用与课程对齐的词汇可以增强学习体验。",

The results demonstrate that the use of curriculum-aligned vocabulary enhances the learning experience and improves engagement in conversations."
