    "translated_abstract": "领域适应的轨迹模仿是一种某些捕食动物为生存学习的技能，通过将动态信息从一个域（它们的速度和转向方向）映射到不同的域（移动猎物的当前位置）。具有此技能的智能代理可以用于各种任务，包括学习模仿代表性轨迹后识别交通中的异常运动。为此，我们提出DATI，一种使用循环一致性生成对抗方法进行领域自适应轨迹模仿的深度强化学习代理。我们在各种合成的参考轨迹家族上的实验表明，DATI在模仿学习和最优控制中的基准方法在这个设置中表现更好，保持相同的每一项任务的超参数。通过发现海上交通的异常运动模式，它在真实世界场景中的泛化能力已得到证明，为深度学习在领域适应轨迹模仿中的应用开辟了道路。",
