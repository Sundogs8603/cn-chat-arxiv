It is crucial for policymakers to have a comprehensive understanding of the public's stance towards vaccination on a large scale. However, attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination, such as pro-vaccine or vaccine hesitancy, have evolved over time on social media. Thus, it is necessary to account for possible temporal shifts when analysing these stances. This study aims to examine the impact of temporal concept drift on stance detection towards COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter. To this end, we evaluate a range of transformer-based models using chronological and random splits of social media data.

    "translated_abstract": "先前的研究指出疫苗接种是控制COVID-19传播的有效策略。了解公众的疫苗态度对决策者至关重要。然而，社交媒体上的 COVID-19 疫苗态度（如支持和犹豫）会随时间而演变，因此在分析这些立场时需要考虑可能的时间漂移。该研究旨在检查时间概念漂移对推特上 COVID-19 疫苗立场检测的影响。为此，我们使用基于转换器的模型对社交媒体数据进行了随机和时间分割的评估。我们的研究发现，在所有单语和多语数据集的随机和时间分割之间，模型性能存在显著差异。时间分割显著降低了立场分类的准确性。",
