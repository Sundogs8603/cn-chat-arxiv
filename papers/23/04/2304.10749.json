    "translated_abstract": "脉冲神经网络（SNN）不仅因其离散信号处理的能源效率卓越，而且因其天然适合于集成多尺度生物可塑性而受到广泛关注。然而，大多数SNN直接采用成熟的DNN结构，很少自动设计神经架构搜索（NAS）用于SNN。人类大脑神经模式的拓扑结构，模块化的区域结构和全局性的跨脑区连接是自然进化的产物，可以作为设计基于脑的SNN架构的完美参考。本文提出了一种多尺度进化神经架构搜索（MSE-NAS），同时考虑微观、中观和宏观尺度的脑拓扑作为进化搜索空间。 MSE-NAS通过基于大脑启发的间接方式，进化单个神经元操作，多个电路模式的自组织集成以及跨模式的全局连通性。",

    "en_tdlr": "A new method, Multi-Scale Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search, is proposed for automatic design of Spiking Neural Networks, which considers micro-, meso-, and macro-scale brain topologies. MSE-NAS can help SNN achieve self-organized integration of multiple circuit motifs and optimize network performance through global connectivity across motifs."
