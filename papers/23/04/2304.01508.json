    "abstract": "Skin lesion recognition using deep learning has made remarkable progress, and there is an increasing need for deploying these systems in real-world scenarios. However, recent research has revealed that deep neural networks for skin lesion recognition may overly depend on disease-irrelevant image artifacts (i.e. dark corners, dense hairs), leading to poor generalization in unseen environments. To address this issue, we propose a novel domain generalization method called EPVT, which involves embedding prompts into the vision transformer to collaboratively learn knowledge from diverse domains. Concretely, EPVT leverages a set of domain prompts, each of which plays as a domain expert, to capture domain-specific knowledge; and a shared prompt for general knowledge over the entire dataset. To facilitate knowledge sharing and the interaction of different prompts, we introduce a domain prompt generator that enables low-rank multiplicative updates between domain prompts and the shared prompt.

    "translated_abstract": "利用深度学习进行皮肤病变识别已取得重大进展，而在现实世界场景中部署这些系统的需求不断增加。然而，最近的研究表明，用于皮肤病变识别的深度神经网络可能过度依赖于与疾病不相关的图像特征（如暗角、浓密毛发），导致在看不见的环境中表现不佳。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的领域一般化方法——EPVT，它将提示嵌入到Vision Transformer中，以协同学习来自不同领域的知识。具体而言，EPVT利用一组领域提示，每个领域提示都扮演领域专家的角色，以捕获领域特定的知识；以及一个共享提示来获得整个数据集的通用知识。为了促进知识共享和不同提示之间的交互，我们引入了一个领域提示生成器，它使得领域提示与共享提示之间可以进行低秩乘性更新。",
