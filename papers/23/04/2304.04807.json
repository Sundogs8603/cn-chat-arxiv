    "abstract": "We present a deep-learning based approach for measuring small planetary radial velocities in the presence of stellar variability. We use neural networks to reduce stellar RV jitter in three years of HARPS-N sun-as-a-star spectra. We develop and compare dimensionality-reduction and data splitting methods, as well as various neural network architectures including single line CNNs, an ensemble of single line CNNs, and a multi-line CNN. We inject planet-like RVs into the spectra and use the network to recover them. We find that the multi-line CNN is able to recover planets with 0.2 m/s semi-amplitude, 50 day period, with 8.8% error in the amplitude and 0.7% in the period. This approach shows promise for mitigating stellar RV variability and enabling the detection of small planetary RVs with unprecedented precision.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，用于在恒星变异存在下测量小行星的径向速度。我们使用神经网络来减少三年HARPS-N太阳-星形光谱中的恒星径向速度抖动。我们开发并比较了不同的降维和数据分割方法，以及各种神经网络体系结构，包括单线CNN、单线CNN集合和多线CNN。我们将类似于行星的径向速度注入光谱中并使用网络恢复它们。我们发现，多线CNN能够恢复0.2m/s半振幅、50天周期的行星，其振幅误差为8.8％，周期误差为0.7％。这种方法展示了在缓解恒星径向速度变异的同时，实现了以前无法想象的小行星径向速度检测精度的承诺。",
