    "translated_abstract": "随着人们越来越依赖基于网络的技术，攻击者窃取用户敏感数据的网络攻击变得越来越普遍。这种攻击的规模和频率正在迅速升级，并影响与互联网连接的各种系统和设备。传统的防御机制可能无法足够地应对复杂和不断变化的新威胁。机器学习方法包括深度学习的重大突破引起了网络安全研究界的兴趣，希望进一步增强现有的异常检测方法。然而，对于所有新兴和复杂的攻击收集带标签的异常数据是不现实的。使用少量标记数据样本训练和调整机器学习模型进行异常检测是一种务实的方法。因此，少样本弱监督异常检测是一个令人鼓舞的研究方向。本文提出了一种使用少样本弱监督学习方法增强现有异常检测模型的方法。我们的模型结合了有标签和无标签数据以提高检测性能。我们在多个数据集上评估了增强模型的表现，并实验证明我们的模型优于现有最先进的方法。",
