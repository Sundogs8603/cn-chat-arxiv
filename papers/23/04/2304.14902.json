    "translated_abstract": "新冠疫情和持续存在的政治和地区冲突对全球供应链产生了极为不利的影响，导致物流操作和国际货运中出现了显著的延误。其中最迫切的问题之一是产品可用性日期的不确定性，这是公司制定有效物流和运输计划的关键信息。因此，准确地预测可用性日期在执行成功的物流操作中发挥着关键作用，最终可以将总运输和库存成本最小化。我们研究通用电气（GE）燃气动力公司的气体和蒸汽涡轮服务和制造业务的货物可用性日期预测，利用数字特征和类别特征。我们评估了几种回归模型，包括简单回归、套索回归、岭回归、弹性网络、随机森林（RF）、梯度提升机（GBM）和神经网络（NM）并比较它们的性能。我们的结果表明，GBM模型表现优于其他模型，实现了4.93天的平均绝对误差和6.47天的均方根误差。此外，我们进行了特征重要性分析，并确定了影响产品可用性日期的关键因素。我们的研究为通过准确的产品可用性预测提高供应链弹性提供了见解，这可以扩展到其他行业和环境中。",

    "en_tdlr": "This article proposes a machine learning-based method for predicting product availability dates under disruption, using General Electric (GE) Gas Power's inbound shipments as an example. The study evaluates several regression models and finds that the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model performs the best, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.93 days and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.47 days. The article also identifies key factors affecting product availability dates through feature importance analysis, providing insights into enhancing supply chain resilience."
