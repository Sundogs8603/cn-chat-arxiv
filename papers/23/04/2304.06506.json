    "translated_abstract": "在许多领域，需要客观的数字化数据来支持改善医疗保健工作的研究，但这类数据却很难获得。虽然消费级可穿戴设备和智能手机等设备的数据比较容易获取，但我们迫切需要与相关糖尿病诊断条件的临床设备提供类似的数据。可穿戴医疗设备在糖尿病领域的普及为该领域及其他相关领域的研究和发展创造了契机。但是，开放数据集的稀缺性成为了发展的主要障碍。为了方便更广泛的糖尿病相关问题研究和加速健壮的计算分析解决方案的开发，我们提供了 DiaTrend 数据集。该数据集包括54位糖尿病患者长期使用的穿戴式医疗设备产生的数据，其中包括总计27,561天的连续血糖监测数据和8,220天的胰岛素泵数据。该数据集对于开发新型的分析解决方案非常有用。",
