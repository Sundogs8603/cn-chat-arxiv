    "translated_abstract": "标签在促进当代互联网时代各种应用中多媒体内容的有效分发方面起着关键作用，如搜索引擎和推荐系统。最近，大型语言模型在各种任务上展示了惊人的能力。在这项工作中，我们提出了TagGPT，这是一个完全自动化的系统，能够以完全零-shot的方式进行标签提取和多模态标注。我们的核心见解是，通过精心设计的提示，LLM能够在给定视觉、语音等多模态数据的文本线索的情况下提取和推理正确的标签。具体来说，为了自动构建反映特定应用程序中用户意图和兴趣的高质量标签集，TagGPT通过提示LLM从一系列原始数据中预测大规模的候选标签，并进行了过滤和语义分析。对于需要分发标记的新实体，TagGPT提出了两个零-shot选项。",
