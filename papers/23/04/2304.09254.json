    "abstract": "The fastMRI brain and knee dataset has enabled significant advances in exploring reconstruction methods for improving speed and image quality for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) via novel, clinically relevant reconstruction approaches. In this study, we describe the April 2023 expansion of the fastMRI dataset to include biparametric prostate MRI data acquired on a clinical population. The dataset consists of raw k-space and reconstructed images for T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted sequences along with slice-level labels that indicate the presence and grade of prostate cancer. As has been the case with fastMRI, increasing accessibility to raw prostate MRI data will further facilitate research in MR image reconstruction and evaluation with the larger goal of improving the utility of MRI for prostate cancer detection and evaluation.
