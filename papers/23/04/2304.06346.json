    "abstract": "Transformer is beneficial for image denoising tasks since it can model long-range dependencies to overcome the limitations presented by inductive convolutional biases. However, directly applying the transformer structure to remove noise is challenging because its complexity grows quadratically with the spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose an efficient Dual-branch Deformable Transformer (DDT) denoising network which captures both local and global interactions in parallel. We divide features with a fixed patch size and a fixed number of patches in local and global branches, respectively. In addition, we apply deformable attention operation in both branches, which helps the network focus on more important regions and further reduces computational complexity. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic denoising tasks, and the proposed DDT achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer computational costs.",

    "translated_abstract": "Transformer对于图像去噪任务非常有益，因为它可以建模长程依赖关系来克服归纳卷积偏差带来的限制。然而，直接应用Transformer结构来去除噪声是具有挑战性的，因为其复杂度与空间分辨率呈二次增长。在本文中，我们提出了一种高效的双支变形Transformer（DDT）去噪网络，它可以同时捕捉局部和全局交互。我们在本地和全局支架上使用固定块尺寸和固定块数来划分特征。此外，我们在两个支架上应用变形注意操作，这有助于网络专注于更重要的区域，并进一步降低计算复杂度。我们在实际和合成去噪任务上进行了广泛的实验，结果表明，提出的DDT具有最先进的性能，且计算成本显著降低。",
