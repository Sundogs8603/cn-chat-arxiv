    "abstract": "Economic models assume that payroll tax burdens fall fully on workers, but where does tax incidence fall when taxes are firm-specific and time-varying? Unemployment insurance in the United States has the key feature of varying both across employers and over time, creating the potential for labor demand responses if tax costs cannot be fully passed on to worker wages. Using state policy changes and matched employer-employee job spells from the LEHD, I study how employment and earnings respond to payroll tax increases for highly exposed employers. I find significant drops in employment growth driven by lower hiring, and minimal evidence of pass-through to earnings. The negative employment effects are strongest for young and low-earning workers.",

    "translated_abstract": "经济模型假设工资税负全部落在劳动者身上，但当税收是特定于企业和时变的时，税负会落在哪里呢？美国的失业保险具有企业间和时间上的变化特征，如果税收成本无法完全转嫁给工资，则有导致劳动力需求的潜力。利用州政策变化和来自 LEHD 的匹配雇主 - 雇员工作期，本文研究高度面临税收的雇主的工资税增加对就业和收入的影响。研究发现，由低招聘率推动的就业增长显著下降，而收入的传导证据最小。负面的就业影响最强烈的是年轻和低收入的工人。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the influence of increasing payroll taxes on employment and income for highly exposed employers based on unemployment insurance. The findings reveal that payroll tax increases result in a significant decrease in employment growth driven by lower hiring, with minimal evidence of pass-through to earnings. The negative employment effects are strongest for young and low-earning workers."
