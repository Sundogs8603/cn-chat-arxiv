    "translated_abstract": "许多复杂场景需要协调拥有独特观点和不同语义承诺的代理。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了立场逻辑（SL）来进行知识整合，通过索引模态可以推理出不同且可能冲突的观点。另一个重要的多模态逻辑是线性时态逻辑（LTL），它是表达系统和过程时间属性的形式化工具，在形式化方法和人工智能相关领域具有重要地位。本文提出了一种新逻辑——立场线性时态逻辑（SLTL），它将 LTL 的时间特性与 SL 的多视角建模能力相结合。我们定义了 SLTL 的语法和语义，确定了其可决定性和复杂性，并提供了一个终止的表演演算法来自动化 SLTL 推理。这为扩展现有的 LTL 推理器提供了一个清晰的路径，并带来了实用推理支持。",
