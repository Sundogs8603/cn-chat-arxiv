    "translated_abstract": "抽取式摘要是自然语言处理中至关重要的任务，旨在通过直接提取句子将长文档压缩为较短的版本。ChatGPT的引入引起了自然语言处理界的广泛关注，因为它在各种下游任务中具有出色的表现。然而，关于其事实性和忠实度的担忧阻碍了其在摘要系统中的实际应用。本文首先对ChatGPT在抽取式摘要上的性能进行了全面评估，并将其与传统的微调方法在各种基准数据集上进行了比较。我们的实验分析揭示，相对于现有的监督系统，ChatGPT在ROUGE分数方面的抽取式摘要性能仍然不足。此外，我们探索了上下文学习和思维链推理对其性能提升的有效性。此外，我们发现采用先抽取后生成流程以及句子选择模块可以缓解ChatGPT生成摘要的忠实性问题。总体而言，我们的研究为使用ChatGPT进行抽取式摘要提供了局限性和潜在改进的见解。",
