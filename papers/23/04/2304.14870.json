    "abstract": "Despite the efficient market hypothesis, many studies suggest the existence of inefficiencies in the stock market, leading to the development of techniques to gain above-market returns, known as alpha. Systematic trading has undergone significant advances in recent decades, with deep learning emerging as a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting market behavior. In this paper, we propose a model inspired by professional traders that look at stock prices of the previous 600 days and predicts whether the stock price rises or falls by a certain percentage within the next D days. Our model, called DeepStock, uses Resnet's skip connections and logits to increase the probability of a model in a trading scheme. We test our model on both the Korean and US stock markets and achieve a profit of N\\% on Korea market, which is M\\% above the market return, and profit of A\\% on US market, which is B\\% above the market return.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管有效市场假说存在，但许多研究表明股票市场存在失灵现象，导致出现了一些能够获得超过市场回报的技术，即alpha。近几十年来，系统性交易已经取得了重大进展，深度学习作为分析和预测市场行为的强大工具已经开始崭露头角。本文中，我们提出了一种受专业交易员启发的模型，该模型查看先前的600天的股票价格，并预测股票价格在接下来D天内是否会升降一定百分比。我们的模型称为DeepStock，使用Resnet的跳跃连接和logits来增加模型在交易方案中的概率。我们在韩国和美国股票市场上测试了我们的模型，并在韩国市场上获得了N％的利润，超过市场回报M％，并在美国市场上获得了A％的利润，超过市场回报B％。",

The model achieved profits above market returns in both the Korean and US stock markets."
