    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT理解用户意图并提供合理的响应的能力，近来变得非常流行。本文聚焦于使用7个细粒度信息提取（IE）任务评估ChatGPT的总体能力。特别地，我们通过测量ChatGPT的性能、可解释性、标定度和忠实度来进行系统分析，结果得出了15个来自ChatGPT或领域专家的关键点。我们的研究发现，ChatGPT在标准IE设置下的表现较差，但在OpenIE设置下却有出色的表现，人类评估证明了这一点。此外，我们的研究表明，ChatGPT提供了高品质和可信的决策解释。然而，ChatGPT在预测时有过度自信的问题，导致了低标定度。此外，ChatGPT在主要文本方面表现出了高度的忠实度。",
