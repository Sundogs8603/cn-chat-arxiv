    "translated_abstract": "多元时间序列（MTS）预测涉及对历史记录中的时间依赖性进行建模。由于能够捕捉长期依赖关系，Transformer在MTS预测中表现出了显著的性能。然而，先前的工作仅局限于在固定尺度或指数级增加的多个尺度上建模时间依赖性（大部分以2为基数）。这种限制阻碍了其在捕捉多样的季节性（例如小时和日常模式）方面的有效性。本文介绍了一种维度不变的嵌入技术，用于捕捉短期时间依赖性并将MTS数据投影到更高维度的空间中，同时保留MTS数据中的时间步骤和变量维度。此外，我们提出了一种新颖的多尺度Transformer金字塔网络（MTPNet），专门设计用于有效地捕捉多个不受限制尺度上的时间依赖性。预测是从多尺度潜变量中推断得出的。",
