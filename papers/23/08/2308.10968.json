    "abstract": "Recent works have demonstrated success in MRI reconstruction using deep learning-based models. However, most reported approaches require training on a task-specific, large-scale dataset. Regularization by denoising (RED) is a general pipeline which embeds a denoiser as a prior for image reconstruction. The potential of RED has been demonstrated for multiple image-related tasks such as denoising, deblurring and super-resolution. In this work, we propose a regularization by neural style transfer (RNST) method to further leverage the priors from the neural transfer and denoising engine. This enables RNST to reconstruct a high-quality image from a noisy low-quality image with different image styles and limited data. We validate RNST with clinical MRI scans from 1.5T and 3T and show that RNST can significantly boost image quality. Our results highlight the capability of the RNST framework for MRI reconstruction and the potential for reconstruction tasks with limited data.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，使用基于深度学习模型的MRI重建取得了成功。然而，大多数报告的方法都需要在特定任务的大规模数据集上进行训练。通过降噪（RED）正规化是一种将降噪器作为图像重建先验的通用流程。RED的潜力已经在多个与图像相关的任务（如降噪、去模糊和超分辨率）中得到了证明。本文提出了一种通过神经风格转换（RNST）方法进行正规化的方法，进一步利用神经转移和降噪引擎的先验信息。这使得RNST能够从有噪声的低质量图像中重建出高质量图像，图像风格和有限数据不同。我们使用1.5T和3T的临床MRI扫描验证了RNST，并且显示RNST可以显著提高图像质量。我们的结果突显了RNST框架在MRI重建和有限数据重建任务中的能力。",
