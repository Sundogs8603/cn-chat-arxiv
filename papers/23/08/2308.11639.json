    "translated_abstract": "在光电子领域，氧化铟锡（ITO）电极在显示器、传感器和太阳能电池等各种应用中起着关键作用。有效的故障检测和诊断是确保设备性能和可靠性的关键。然而，传统的视觉检查对于透明的ITO电极来说具有挑战性，而现有的故障检测方法在确定缺陷根本原因方面存在局限性，通常需要破坏性评估。本研究提出了一种利用散射参数（S参数）信号处理的现场故障诊断方法，提供了早期检测、高诊断精度、噪声鲁棒性和根本原因分析。根据缺陷状态获取了全面的S参数模式数据库。然后使用深度学习（DL）方法，包括多层感知器（MLP）、卷积神经网络（CNN）和Transformer，同时分析故障原因和严重性。",
