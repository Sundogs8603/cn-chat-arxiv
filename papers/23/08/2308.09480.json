    "translated_abstract": "在最近通胀激增爆发时，公众对通胀的关注度很低，但一旦通胀开始上升，关注度迅速增加。本文构建了一个一般均衡货币模型，该模型在通胀低而稳定时，最优化的策略是对通胀关注较少，但一旦通胀超过某个阈值，就会增加关注度。利用调查问卷中的通胀预期，我估计关注阈值在4%通胀率，高关注区域的关注度是低关注区域的两倍。当校准到这些发现时，该模型产生与美国最近通胀激增一致的通胀和通胀预期动态。关注阈值导致状态依赖性：成本推动冲击在货币宽松政策时更加通胀。这些状态依赖性效应在恒定关注或理性预期模型中是不存在的。",
    "tldr": "本论文研究了通胀关注度与通胀激增之间的关系，发现在通胀率低稳定时，人们关注度较低，但一旦通胀率超过4%，关注度会明显增加，高关注区域的关注度是低关注区域的两倍。这种关注阈值的存在导致了状态依赖效应，即在宽松货币政策时，成本推动冲击对通胀的影响更大。这些结论有助于理解最近美国的通胀激增现象。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the relationship between attention to inflation and inflation surges. It finds that when inflation is low and stable, people pay less attention, but once inflation exceeds 4%, there is a significant increase in attention, with attention in the high-attention regime being twice as high as in the low-attention regime. The existence of this attention threshold leads to state-dependent effects, where cost-push shocks have a larger impact on inflation during loose monetary policy. These findings contribute to understanding the recent inflation surge in the US."
