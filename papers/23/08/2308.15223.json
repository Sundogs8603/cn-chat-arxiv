    "translated_abstract": "多变量时间序列分类是一项重要的计算任务，出现在数据随时间和多个通道记录的应用中。例如，智能手表可以记录人体运动的加速度和方向，这些信号被记录为多变量时间序列。我们可以对这些数据进行分类，以了解和预测人体运动和各种属性，如健身水平。在许多应用中，仅靠分类是不够的，我们通常需要分类，同时还要理解模型学到了什么（例如，基于数据中的哪些信息给出了预测）。本文的重点是分析和评估专用于多变量时间序列分类（MTSC）的解释方法。我们着重研究了能指出分类决策中最相关通道和时间序列点的基于显著性的解释方法。我们分析了两种流行且准确的多变量时间序列分类器，ROCKET和...",
