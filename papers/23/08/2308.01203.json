    "abstract": "Developing methods for extracting relevant legal information to aid legal practitioners is an active research area. In this regard, research efforts are being made by leveraging different kinds of information, such as meta-data, citations, keywords, sentences, paragraphs, etc. Similar to any text document, legal documents are composed of paragraphs. In this paper, we have analyzed the resourcefulness of paragraph-level information in capturing similarity among judgments for improving the performance of precedence retrieval. We found that the paragraph-level methods could capture the similarity among the judgments with only a few paragraph interactions and exhibit more discriminating power over the baseline document-level method. Moreover, the comparison results on two benchmark datasets for the precedence retrieval on the Indian supreme court judgments task show that the paragraph-level methods exhibit comparable performance with the state-of-the-art methods",

    "translated_abstract": "开发提取相关法律信息以帮助法律从业者的方法是一个活跃的研究领域。在这方面，研究工作通过利用不同类型的信息，如元数据、引用文献、关键词、句子、段落等，正在进行。与任何文本文档一样，法律文件由段落组成。本文分析了段落级别信息在捕捉判例相似性以提高先例检索性能方面的资源利用性。我们发现，段落级别方法只需少量段落交互即可捕捉判例之间的相似性，并且在基线文档级别方法上具有更强的区分能力。此外，对印度最高法院判决任务的两个基准数据集进行的比较结果表明，段落级别方法与最先进的方法具有可比性的性能。",
