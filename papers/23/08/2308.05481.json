    "translated_abstract": "数据库管理员（DBA）在管理、维护和优化数据库系统以确保数据可用性、性能和可靠性方面起着至关重要的作用。然而，对于DBA来说，管理大量数据库实例（例如，云数据库上的数百万个实例）是困难和繁琐的。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）已经显示出了理解有价值文件并生成合理答案的巨大潜力。因此，我们提出了D-Bot，一种基于LLM的数据库管理员，它可以持续从文本来源中获取数据库维护经验，并为目标数据库提供合理、有理、及时的诊断和优化建议。本文介绍了一个革命性的以LLM为中心的数据库维护框架，包括（i）从文档和工具中检测数据库维护知识，（ii）根本原因分析的思维树，和（iii）多个LLM之间的协作诊断。我们进行了初步实验。",
