    "abstract": "Recently, there has been significant attention on determining the minimum width for the universal approximation property of deep, narrow MLPs. Among these challenges, approximating a continuous function under the uniform norm is important and challenging, with the gap between its lower and upper bound being hard to narrow. In this regard, we propose a novel upper bound for the minimum width, given by $\\operatorname{max}(2d_x+1, d_y) + \\alpha(\\sigma)$, to achieve uniform approximation in deep narrow MLPs, where $0\\leq \\alpha(\\sigma)\\leq 2$ represents the constant depending on the activation function. We demonstrate this bound through two key proofs. First, we establish that deep, narrow MLPs with little additional width can approximate diffeomorphisms. Secondly, we utilize the Whitney embedding theorem to show that any continuous function can be approximated by embeddings, further decomposed into linear transformations and diffeomorphisms.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，人们对于确定深度、窄型多层感知机的通用逼近性的最小宽度问题引起了相当大的关注。在这些挑战中，以一致范数逼近连续函数是重要且具有挑战性的，其下界和上界之间的差距很难缩小。在这方面，我们提出了一种新的最小宽度的上界，即$\\operatorname{max}(2d_x+1, d_y) + \\alpha(\\sigma)$，以实现在深度窄型多层感知机中的一致逼近，其中$0\\leq \\alpha(\\sigma)\\leq 2$代表了与激活函数相关的常数。我们通过两个关键证明来证明这个上界。首先，我们证明了具有较小的额外宽度的深度窄型多层感知机可以逼近微分同胚。其次，我们利用惠特尼嵌入定理表明任何连续函数都可以通过嵌入逼近，进一步分解为线性变换和微分同胚。",
