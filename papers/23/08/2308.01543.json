    "translated_abstract": "我们探索了在创建2D游戏关卡时，使用AI增强的上采样作为设计辅助工具。我们使用深度神经网络将来自谜题平台游戏Lode Runner的人工降低分辨率的关卡片段进行上采样。训练得到的网络被整合到一个基于Web的编辑器中，用户可以以3个不同的分辨率（4x4、8x8和16x16）创建和编辑关卡。在任何分辨率上的编辑都会立即传输到其他分辨率上。由于上采样需要发明在较低分辨率下可能不存在的特征，我们训练神经网络来复制这些特征。我们引入了一种神经网络架构，它不仅能够学习上采样，还能够更高优先级地处理不太常见的图块。为了调查这个工具的潜力并指导进一步的开发，我们进行了一个定性研究，与3位设计师协作，了解他们如何使用它。设计师享受与这个工具的共同设计过程，喜欢它的基本概念，并提供了反馈。",

By using deep neural networks, the authors are able to upscale artificially downscaled patches of game levels and introduce a neural network architecture that can learn and handle less frequent tiles during the upscaling process. Through a qualitative study with designers, it is found that they enjoy co-designing with the tool and see its potential for further development."
