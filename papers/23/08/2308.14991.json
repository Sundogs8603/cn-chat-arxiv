    "translated_abstract": "持续学习旨在赋予人工智能（AI）对真实世界的强大适应能力。为此，一个理想的解决方案应该在记忆稳定性和学习可塑性之间保持适当平衡，并获得足够的兼容性来捕捉观测到的分布。现有的进展主要集中在保持记忆稳定性以克服灾难性遗忘，但仍难以像生物智能（BI）那样灵活地适应增量变化。通过建模一个能够主动调节遗忘的稳健果蝇学习系统，并利用多个学习模块，我们提出了一种通用方法，通过在参数分布中适当衰减旧记忆来改善学习可塑性，并相应地协调多学习者架构来确保解决方案的兼容性。通过广泛的理论和实证验证，我们的方法不仅明显提高了持续学习的性能，特别是在突触调节方面。",
