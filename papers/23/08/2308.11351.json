    "abstract": "Given the long textual product information and the product image, Multi-Modal Product Summarization (MMPS) aims to attract customers' interest and increase their desire to purchase by highlighting product characteristics with a short textual summary. Existing MMPS methods have achieved promising performance. Nevertheless, there still exist several problems: 1) lack end-to-end product summarization, 2) lack multi-grained multi-modal modeling, and 3) lack multi-modal attribute modeling. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end multi-grained multi-modal attribute-aware product summarization method (M3PS) for generating high-quality product summaries in e-commerce. M3PS jointly models product attributes and generates product summaries. Meanwhile, we design several multi-grained multi-modal tasks to better guide the multi-modal learning of M3PS. Furthermore, we model product attributes based on both text and image modalities so that multi-modal product characteristics can be manife",

    "translated_abstract": "多模态产品摘要（MMPS）旨在通过突出产品特点的短文本摘要来吸引客户的兴趣并增加其购买欲望。现有的MMPS方法已经取得了令人满意的性能。然而，仍然存在几个问题：1）缺乏端到端的产品摘要，2）缺乏多粒度多模态建模，以及3）缺乏多模态属性建模。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种用于在电子商务中生成高质量产品摘要的端到端多粒度多模态属性感知产品摘要方法（M3PS）。M3PS同时对产品属性进行建模并生成产品摘要。同时，我们设计了几个多粒度多模态任务，以更好地指导M3PS的多模态学习。此外，我们基于文本和图像模态对产品属性进行建模，以使多模态产品特性能够得到体现。",
