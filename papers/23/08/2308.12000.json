    "abstract": "We study the problem of best-arm identification with fixed budget in stochastic two-arm bandits with Bernoulli rewards. We prove that surprisingly, there is no algorithm that (i) performs as well as the algorithm sampling each arm equally (this algorithm is referred to as the {\\it uniform sampling} algorithm) on all instances, and that (ii) strictly outperforms this algorithm on at least one instance. In short, there is no algorithm better than the uniform sampling algorithm. Towards this result, we introduce the natural class of {\\it consistent} and {\\it stable} algorithms, and show that any algorithm that performs as well as the uniform sampling algorithm on all instances belongs to this class. The proof is completed by deriving a lower bound on the error rate satisfied by any consistent and stable algorithm, and by showing that the uniform sampling algorithm matches this lower bound.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在具有伯努利奖励的随机二臂赌博机中，使用有限预算进行最佳臂选择的问题。我们证明令人惊讶的是，不存在一个算法可以在所有情况下与等概率采样算法表现一样好（该算法被称为“均匀采样”算法），并且在至少一个情况下明显优于该算法。简而言之，不存在比均匀采样算法更好的算法。为了证明这一结果，我们引入了“一致”和“稳定”算法的自然类，并且证明了任何算法要在所有情况下与均匀采样算法表现一样好，必须属于这个类别。通过导出满足任何一致且稳定算法的错误率的下界，并证明均匀采样算法与此下界相匹配，我们完成了证明过程。我们的结果解决了\\cite{qin2022open}中提出的两个未解之谜。",
