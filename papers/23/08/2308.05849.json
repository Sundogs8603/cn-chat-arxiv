    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种用于计算具有实际金融市场、家庭生产和保留的交换经济的均衡的新方法。我们证明了均衡价格可以通过求解一个相关的最优化问题来确定。我们将金融市场的无套利条件纳入均衡形式化，并建立了两个问题解之间的等价性。通过消除直接计算金融合同价格的需要，这降低了原始问题的复杂性，使我们能够在金融市场不完备的情况下计算均衡。我们还引入了一个捕捉不平衡的Walrasian双函数，并证明了该函数的maxinf点对应于均衡点。此外，我们通过依赖于lopsided收敛的概念来证明，每个均衡点都可以近似于一系列扰动问题的maxinf点的极限。最后，我们明确了一种自动预测和迭代求解均衡问题的方法。",
