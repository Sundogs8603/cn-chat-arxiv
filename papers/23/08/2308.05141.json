    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了在具有移动源的三维虚拟房间中进行声音传播模拟的挑战，这在虚拟/增强现实、游戏音频和空间计算方面具有应用。通过求解波动方程，可以描述衍射和干涉等波动现象。然而，使用传统的数值离散化方法模拟涉及数百个源和接收器位置的波动方程是不可行的，使得使用移动源刺激声场变得不切实际。为了解决这个限制，我们提出使用深度操作器网络来逼近线性波动方程操作器。这使得能够快速预测在具有移动源的真实三维声学场景中的声音传播，达到毫秒级的计算。通过学习紧凑的代理模型，我们避免了为所有相关的源/听者对计算和存储脉冲响应的离线计算。我们的实验证明，在包含各种复杂场景几何形状的情况下，与参考结果达成了良好的一致性。",
