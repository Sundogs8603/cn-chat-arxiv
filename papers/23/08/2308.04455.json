    "translated_abstract": "随着语音用户界面的广泛使用，语音数据的收集和存储也大大增加。虽然数据收集可以为大多数语音服务提供高效的工具，但它也给用户的隐私造成严重的问题，因为集中存储使个人的语音数据容易受到网络威胁的侵害。随着亚马逊的Alexa，谷歌的Home和苹果的Siri等基于语音的数字助手的使用增加，以及个人语音数据收集变得越来越容易，声音克隆和说话人/性别/病理等识别的恶意使用的风险也增加了。本文提出了匿名化语音的解决方案，并评估匿名化的程度。在这项工作中，匿名化是指使个人语音数据与身份无法关联，同时保持语音信号的实用性（例如，访问语言内容）。我们首先确定了几个评估协议的挑战。",
