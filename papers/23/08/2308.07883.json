    "translated_abstract": "最近，图神经网络（GNNs）在动态图任务如节点分类、链接预测和图回归等方面表现出了很有前景的性能。然而，很少有工作研究了具有重要现实应用的时态边缘回归任务。在本文中，我们探索了GNNs在静态和动态设置下边缘回归任务中的应用，重点是预测国家之间的食品和农业贸易价值。我们引入了三个简单但强大的基准线，并使用联合国贸易数据集全面评估了一个静态和三个动态GNN模型。我们的实验结果表明，这些基线在各种设置下表现出异常强大的性能，突显了现有GNNs的不足之处。我们还发现，TGN优于其他GNN模型，这表明TGN是边缘回归任务的更合适选择。此外，我们注意到训练样本中负边的比例显著影响了测试的结果。",
