    "abstract": "This paper presents a fully automated approach for identifying speech anomalies from voice recordings to aid in the assessment of speech impairments. By combining Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and encoder-decoder-based automatic speech recognition models, we generate rich acoustic and clean transcripts. We then apply several natural language processing methods to extract features from these transcripts to produce prototypes of healthy speech. Basic distance measures from these prototypes serve as input features for standard machine learning classifiers, yielding human-level accuracy for the distinction between recordings of people with aphasia and a healthy control group. Furthermore, the most frequently occurring aphasia types can be distinguished with 90% accuracy. The pipeline is directly applicable to other diseases and languages, showing promise for robustly extracting diagnostic speech biomarkers.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种全自动的方法，通过声音录音识别来辅助评估言语障碍。通过结合连接主义时间分类（CTC）和基于编码器-解码器的自动语音识别模型，我们生成了丰富的声学和清晰的转录。然后，我们应用几种自然语言处理方法从这些转录中提取特征，以生成健康语音的原型。基于这些原型的基本距离度量作为标准机器学习分类器的输入特征，能够在人类水平上区分失语症患者的录音和健康对照组。此外，最常见的失语症类型可以以90%的准确率进行区分。该流程可直接适用于其他疾病和语言，展示了强大的潜力来稳健地提取诊断性言语生物标志。",
