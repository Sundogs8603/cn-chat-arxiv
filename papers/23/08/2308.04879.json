    "abstract": "Chatbots are capable of remembering and referencing previous conversations, but does this enhance user engagement or infringe on privacy? To explore this trade-off, we investigated the format of how a chatbot references previous conversations with a user and its effects on a user's perceptions and privacy concerns. In a three-week longitudinal between-subjects study, 169 participants talked about their dental flossing habits to a chatbot that either, (1-None): did not explicitly reference previous user utterances, (2-Verbatim): referenced previous utterances verbatim, or (3-Paraphrase): used paraphrases to reference previous utterances. Participants perceived Verbatim and Paraphrase chatbots as more intelligent and engaging. However, the Verbatim chatbot also raised privacy concerns with participants. To gain insights as to why people prefer certain conditions or had privacy concerns, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 participants. We discuss implications from our finding",

    "translated_abstract": "聊天机器人能够记忆和引用之前的对话，但这是否增强了用户的参与度还是侵犯了隐私？为了探讨这种权衡，我们研究了聊天机器人如何引用用户之前对话的形式，以及对用户的感知和隐私关注的影响。在为期三周的纵向随机组实验中，我们让169名参与者向一个聊天机器人谈论他们的使用牙线的习惯，并将聊天机器人分为三组：(1-None)：不明确引用以前用户的话语，(2-Verbatim)：逐字引用以前的话语，(3-Paraphrase)：使用释义来引用以前的话语。参与者认为逐字引用和释义引用的聊天机器人更智能和引人入胜。然而，逐字引用的聊天机器人也引起了参与者的隐私关注。为了了解为什么人们更倾向于某些条件或担心隐私问题，我们进行了半结构化访谈，共有15名参与者。我们讨论了我们的发现带来的影响。",
