Firstly, users generally click different types of items from multiple scenarios, and modeling from multiple scenarios can provide a more comprehensive understanding of users. Existing datasets only include data for the same type of items from a single scenario. Secondly, multi-modal features are essential in multi-scenario prediction as they address the issue of inconsistent ID encoding between different scenarios. The existing datasets are based on ID features and lack multi-modal features. Third, a large-scale dataset can provide a more reliable evaluation of models, fully reflecting the performance differences between models. The scale of existing datasets is around 100 million, which is relatively small compared to the real-world CTR prediction. To address these limit",

    "translated_abstract": "点击率（CTR）预测在推荐系统中是一个关键问题。出现了各种公开的CTR数据集。然而，现有数据集主要存在以下限制。首先，用户通常会从多个场景中点击不同类型的项目，从多个场景建模可以更全面地了解用户。现有数据集只包括来自单个场景的相同类型项目的数据。其次，多模态特征在多场景预测中是必不可少的，因为它们解决了不同场景之间不一致的ID编码问题。现有数据集基于ID特征，缺乏多模态特征。第三，大规模数据集可以提供更可靠的模型评估，充分反映模型之间的性能差异。现有数据集的规模约为1亿，与现实世界的CTR预测相比相对较小。为了解决这些限制",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一个名为AntM$^{2}$C的大规模数据集，用于多场景多模态点击率预测。该数据集弥补了现有数据集的限制，包括多个场景中不同类型项目的建模以及多模态特征的缺乏。它将为模型的可靠评估提供更全面的性能差异。",

The dataset addresses the limitations of existing datasets by including modeling of different types of items from multiple scenarios and incorporating multi-modal features. It provides a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance."
