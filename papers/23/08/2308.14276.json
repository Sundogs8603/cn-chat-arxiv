    "abstract": "Micro-videos platforms such as TikTok are extremely popular nowadays. One important feature is that users no longer select interested videos from a set, instead they either watch the recommended video or skip to the next one. As a result, the time length of users' watching behavior becomes the most important signal for identifying preferences. However, our empirical data analysis has shown a video-length effect that long videos are easier to receive a higher value of average view time, thus adopting such view-time labels for measuring user preferences can easily induce a biased model that favors the longer videos. In this paper, we propose a Video Length Debiasing Recommendation (VLDRec) method to alleviate such an effect for micro-video recommendation. VLDRec designs the data labeling approach and the sample generation module that better capture user preferences in a view-time oriented manner.

    "translated_abstract": "微视频平台如抖音等现在非常流行。一个重要的特点是用户不再从一组视频中选择感兴趣的视频，而是要么观看推荐的视频，要么跳转到下一个视频。因此，用户观看行为的时间长度成为识别偏好的最重要信号。然而，我们的经验数据分析显示了视频长度效应，即长视频更容易获得更高的平均观看时间，因此采用这种观看时间标签来衡量用户偏好可能会导致偏差模型更偏向于长视频。在本文中，我们提出了一种缓解微视频推荐中视频长度效应的方法-视频长度消除推荐（VLDRec）。VLDRec设计了数据标注方法和样本生成模块，以更好地以观看时间为导向捕捉用户偏好。它进一步利用多任务学习技术来联合优化上述样本。",
