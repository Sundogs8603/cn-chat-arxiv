    "translated_abstract": "产品碳足迹（PCF）对于减缓供应链的碳排放至关重要，它衡量了产品生命周期中所有活动所导致的直接和间接温室气体排放量。然而，PCF核算通常需要专业知识和大量时间来构建生命周期模型。在本研究中，我们测试比较了五个大型语言模型（LLMs）在建模产品的“摇篮到大门”生命周期并生成输入和输出的库存数据方面的应用能力，揭示了它们作为一个广义PCF知识数据库的局限性。通过利用LLMs，我们提出了一种自动化AI驱动的PCF核算框架，称为AutoPCF，该框架还应用深度学习算法自动匹配计算参数，并最终计算PCF。利用AutoPCF框架对三个案例产品的碳足迹进行估算的结果表明，它在实现PCF的自动建模和估算方面具有潜力。",
