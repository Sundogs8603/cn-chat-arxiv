    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统已成为音乐流媒体服务中不可或缺的部分，通过个性化播放列表和促进偶然发现新音乐来提升用户体验。然而，现有的推荐系统忽视了音乐领域固有的独特挑战，特别是随机播放会以随机序列提供连续的曲目。基于我们的观察，随机播放会话主要由于高独特转换率阻碍了音乐推荐系统的整体训练过程，我们提出了一种名为MUSE的音乐推荐系统，该系统增强了随机播放推荐。 MUSE采用自监督学习框架，通过增加曲目的转换来最大化原始播放会话与增强会话之间的一致性，这种增强通过我们的新颖会话增强方法（称为基于转换的增强）来实现。为了进一步促进两个视图之间的表示对齐，我们设计了两种细粒度机制。",
