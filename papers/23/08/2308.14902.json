    "abstract": "Recommendation models are vital in delivering personalized user experiences by leveraging the correlation between multiple input features. However, deep learning-based recommendation models often face challenges due to evolving user behaviour and item features, leading to covariate shifts. Effective cross-feature learning is crucial to handle data distribution drift and adapting to changing user behaviour. Traditional feature interaction techniques have limitations in achieving optimal performance in this context.  This work introduces Ad-Rec, an advanced network that leverages feature interaction techniques to address covariate shifts. This helps eliminate irrelevant interactions in recommendation tasks. Ad-Rec leverages masked transformers to enable the learning of higher-order cross-features while mitigating the impact of data distribution drift. Our approach improves model quality, accelerates convergence, and reduces training time, as measured by the Area Under Curve (AUC) metric.",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐模型通过利用多个输入特征之间的相关性，在提供个性化用户体验方面起到重要作用。然而，基于深度学习的推荐模型经常面临用户行为和物品特征不断变化导致的协变量漂移问题。在处理数据分布漂移和适应用户行为变化方面，有效的特征交互学习至关重要。传统的特征交互技术在这种情况下存在一些局限性。本文介绍了Ad-Rec，一个利用特征交互技术来解决协变量漂移问题的高级网络。这有助于消除推荐任务中的无关交互。Ad-Rec利用掩码转换器来实现高阶交叉特征的学习，同时减轻数据分布漂移的影响。我们的方法通过Area Under Curve（AUC）指标衡量，提高了模型质量，加快了收敛速度，减少了训练时间。",
