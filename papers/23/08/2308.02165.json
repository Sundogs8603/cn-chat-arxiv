    "translated_abstract": "晶体扩散变分自动编码器（CDVAE）是一种利用分数匹配生成保留晶体对称性的逼真晶体结构的机器学习模型。本研究中，我们采用了新颖的扩散概率（DP）模型来去噪原子坐标，而不是采用CDVAE中的标准分数匹配方法。我们提出的DP-CDVAE模型可以重建和生成在质量上与原始CDVAE相当的晶体结构。值得注意的是，当将DP-CDVAE模型生成的碳结构与从密度泛函理论计算得到的弛豫结构进行比较时，我们发现DP-CDVAE生成的结构与其相应基态更接近。这些结构与真实基态之间的能量差平均比原始CDVAE生成的能量差低了68.1 meV/原子。这种能量准确性的显著改进凸显了其创新性和贡献。",
