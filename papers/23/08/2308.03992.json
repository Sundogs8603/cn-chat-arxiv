Leveraging a design-based research approach, we develop, implement, and evaluate a novel learning environment enriched with four distinct chatbot roles: Instructor Bot, Peer Bot, Career Advising Bot, and Emotional Supporter Bot. These roles, designed around the tenets of Self-Determination Theory, cater to the three innate psychological needs of learners - competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Additionally, the system embraces an inquiry-based learning paradigm, encouraging students to ask questions, seek solutions, and explore their curiosities.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究调查了使用人工智能 (AI) 驱动的多角色聊天机器人作为增强学习体验和促进计算机科学教育参与度的手段。利用基于设计的研究方法，我们开发、实施和评估了一个新颖的学习环境，其中包含四个不同的聊天机器人角色：导师机器人、同伴机器人、职业咨询机器人和情感支持机器人。这些角色基于自我决定理论的原则设计，满足学习者的三种内在心理需求：能力、自主性和关联性。此外，该系统采用了探究式学习范式，鼓励学生提问、寻求解决方案并探索他们的好奇心。我们在一个高等教育环境中以200名参与学生为期一个月的时间测试了该系统，并将结果与涉及人类导师和单个聊天机器人的条件进行了比较。我们的研究采用了混合方法的方法，包括数量和质量的数据收集和分析。",
