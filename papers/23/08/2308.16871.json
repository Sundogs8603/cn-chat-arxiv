    "translated_abstract": "语言生成系统中的性别偏见很难被缓解。其中一个可能导致这种偏见的原因是训练和评估数据中的性别表征不平衡。尽管最近在记录这个问题和试图缓解它方面取得了一些进展，但我们仍然缺乏共享的方法论和工具，以报告大规模数据集中的性别表征。这种定量报告将使进一步缓解成为可能，例如通过数据增强。本文描述了Gender-GAP Pipeline（用于性别感知的多语言流水线），它是一个自动流程，用于对55种语言的大规模数据集进行性别表征。该流水线使用一个多语言性别人称名词词汇表来量化文本中的性别表征。我们展示了它来报告WMT训练数据和新闻任务的开发数据中的性别表征，证实当前数据偏向男性表征。拥有不平衡的数据集可能会间接地优化我们的系统。",
