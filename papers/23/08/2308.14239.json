    "translated_abstract": "下一代油藏计算是一种现代的基于模型的机器学习方法，可以准确预测由动力系统产生的时间序列数据。我们证明了下一代油藏计算可以在可积和混沌系统中准确预测整体多体量子动力学，与传统的油藏计算方法相比，后者只着重于预测可观察量的动力学。此外，我们应用了一种称为\"跳先\"的技术，可以准确预测远未来的状态，而无需提取中间状态的信息。然而，采用经典的下一代油藏计算方法来预测多体量子动力学是计算上不可行的，因为样本输入数据的希尔伯特空间非常大。在本文中，我们提出了一种端到端的用于多体量子动力学预测的量子算法，通过块编码技术实现量子计算的加速。这个方案提供了一种高效的模式。",
