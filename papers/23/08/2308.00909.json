    "abstract": "In this vision paper, we propose a shift in perspective for improving the effectiveness of similarity search. Rather than focusing solely on enhancing the data quality, particularly machine learning-generated embeddings, we advocate for a more comprehensive approach that also enhances the underpinning search mechanisms. We highlight three novel avenues that call for a redefinition of the similarity search problem: exploiting implicit data structures and distributions, engaging users in an iterative feedback loop, and moving beyond a single query vector. These novel pathways have gained relevance in emerging applications such as large-scale language models, video clip retrieval, and data labeling. We discuss the corresponding research challenges posed by these new problem areas and share insights from our preliminary discoveries.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇展望性论文中，我们提出了一个改变视角的方法来提高相似度搜索的效果。我们主张不仅要提高数据质量，特别是机器学习生成的嵌入向量，还要综合性地改进搜索机制。我们重点介绍了三个新颖的方向，需要重新定义相似度搜索问题：利用隐式的数据结构和分布、让用户参与迭代反馈循环、超越单一查询向量。这些新颖的研究路径在新兴应用领域，如大规模语言模型、视频片段检索和数据标注中变得越来越重要。我们讨论了这些新问题领域所带来的研究挑战，并分享了我们初步的发现。",
