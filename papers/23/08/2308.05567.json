To address these challenges, we propose an interactive conversation visualization system called C5, which includes Global View, Topic View, and Context-associated Q\\&A View. The Global View uses the GitLog diagram metaphor to represent the conversation structure, presenting the trend of conversation evolution and supporting the exploration of locally salient features.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs），如ChatGPT，在各个领域，特别是自然语言理解和生成任务中表现出色。在复杂的应用场景中，用户倾向于与ChatGPT进行多轮对话，以保持上下文信息并获得全面的回复。然而，人类遗忘和模型上下文遗忘仍然是多轮对话场景中突出的问题，这挑战了用户对ChatGPT的对话理解和上下文连贯性。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一个交互式对话可视化系统C5，其中包括全局视图、主题视图和上下文相关的问答视图。全局视图使用GitLog图表的隐喻来表示对话结构，展示对话演变的趋势，并支持局部显著特征的探索。主题视图旨在显示所有的问题和答案节点。",
