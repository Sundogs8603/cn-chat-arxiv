    "abstract": "Bias in textual data can lead to skewed interpretations and outcomes when the data is used. These biases could perpetuate stereotypes, discrimination, or other forms of unfair treatment. An algorithm trained on biased data ends up making decisions that disproportionately impact a certain group of people. Therefore, it is crucial to detect and remove these biases to ensure the fair and ethical use of data. To this end, we develop a comprehensive and robust framework \\textsc{Nbias} that consists of a data layer, corpus contruction, model development layer and an evaluation layer. The dataset is constructed by collecting diverse data from various fields, including social media, healthcare, and job hiring portals. As such, we applied a transformer-based token classification model that is able to identify bias words/ phrases through a unique named entity. In the assessment procedure, we incorporate a blend of quantitative and qualitative evaluations to gauge the effectiveness of our models.",

    "translated_abstract": "在文本数据中存在偏见可能导致数据使用时产生倾斜的解释和结果。这些偏见可能会持续强化刻板印象、歧视或其他形式的不公平待遇。在有偏见的数据上训练的算法最终会做出不平等影响某个群体的决策。因此，检测和消除这些偏见至关重要，以确保对数据的公平和道德使用。为此，我们开发了一个全面而强大的框架\"NBIAS\"，它包括数据层、语料库构建、模型开发层和评估层。数据集由从各个领域收集的多样化数据构建，包括社交媒体、医疗保健和职位招聘门户网站。因此，我们应用了基于Transformer的令牌分类模型，通过一个唯一的命名实体能够识别出偏见词/短语。在评估过程中，我们结合了定量和定性评估方法来评估我们模型的效果。",
