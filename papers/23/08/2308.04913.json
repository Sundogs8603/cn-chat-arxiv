    "translated_abstract": "电子商务创作涉及创建吸引人、丰富且有针对性的促销内容，以推动产品销售。大型语言模型（LLM）的出现引入了一种创新的范例，为解决这种情景中的各种创作任务提供了统一的解决方案。然而，基于通用语料库和常识知识训练的主流LLM在适应电子商务产品和客户独特的复杂和个性化特征方面存在局限性。此外，像GPT-3.5这样的LLM需要进行远程访问，引发了在传输过程中保护大量客户隐私数据的担忧。本文提出了LLaMA-E，针对多样化的电子商务创作任务的统一且定制的指导语言模型。具体而言，领域专家从广告生成、查询增强的产品标题改写、产品分类、购买意图推测和常规问答等任务中创建了种子指导集合。这些任务能够...",
