    "abstract": "This study investigates the causal interpretation of linear social interaction models in the presence of endogeneity in network formation under a heterogeneous treatment effects framework. We consider an experimental setting in which individuals are randomly assigned to treatments while no interventions are made for the network structure. We show that running a linear regression ignoring network endogeneity is not problematic for estimating the average direct treatment effect. However, it leads to sample selection bias and negative-weights problem for the estimation of the average spillover effect. To overcome these problems, we propose using potential peer treatment as an instrumental variable (IV), which is automatically a valid IV for actual spillover exposure. Using this IV, we examine two IV-based estimands and demonstrate that they have a local average treatment-effect-type causal interpretation for the spillover effect.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究在异质处理效应框架下，研究了在内生网络形成条件下线性社交互作用模型的因果解释。我们考虑了一个实验设置，其中个体被随机分配到处理组，但对网络结构没有干预。我们发现，在估计平均直接处理效应时，忽略网络内生性进行线性回归并没有问题。然而，对于估计平均溢出效应，这种做法会导致样本选择偏误和负权重问题。为了克服这些问题，我们提出使用潜在同伴处理作为工具变量（IV），它自动成为实际溢出暴露的有效IV。利用这个IV，我们研究了两个基于IV的估计量，并证明它们对于溢出效应具有局部平均处理效应类型的因果解释。",
