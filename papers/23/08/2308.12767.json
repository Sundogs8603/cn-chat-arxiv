    "abstract": "A prevalent practice in recommender systems consists of averaging item embeddings to represent users or higher-level concepts in the same embedding space. This paper investigates the relevance of such a practice. For this purpose, we propose an expected precision score, designed to measure the consistency of an average embedding relative to the items used for its construction. We subsequently analyze the mathematical expression of this score in a theoretical setting with specific assumptions, as well as its empirical behavior on real-world data from music streaming services. Our results emphasize that real-world averages are less consistent for recommendation, which paves the way for future research to better align real-world embeddings with assumptions from our theoretical setting.",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统中一种流行的做法是将物品嵌入进行平均以在同一嵌入空间中代表用户或更高级的概念。本文研究了这种做法的相关性。为此，我们提出了一种期望精度分数，用于衡量平均嵌入与其构建所使用的物品的一致性。我们随后在具有特定假设的理论环境和来自音乐流媒体服务的真实数据上分析了该分数的数学表达式及其经验表现。我们的结果强调了现实世界的平均值在推荐中的一致性较低，为未来研究更好地将现实世界的嵌入与我们理论环境的假设相一致铺平了道路。",

The empirical results show that real-world average embeddings have lower consistency in recommendation, providing guidance for further improvement in real-world embeddings."
