    "abstract": "This paper illustrates how generative AI could give opportunities for big productivity gains but also opens up questions about the impact of these new powerful technologies on the way we work and share knowledge. More specifically, we explore how ChatGPT changed a fundamental aspect of coding: problem-solving. To do so, we exploit the effect of the sudden release of ChatGPT on the 30th of November 2022 on the usage of the largest online community for coders: Stack Overflow. Using quasi-experimental methods (Difference-in-Difference), we find a significant drop in the number of questions. In addition, the questions are better documented after the release of ChatGPT. Finally, we find evidence that the remaining questions are more complex. These findings suggest not only productivity gains but also a fundamental change in the way we work where routine inquiries are solved by AI allowing humans to focus on more complex tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文阐述了生成式AI如何为巨大的生产力提升提供机会，同时也引发了关于这些新强大技术对我们工作和共享知识方式的影响的问题。具体而言，我们探讨了ChatGPT如何改变了编码的一个基本方面：问题解决。为此，我们利用了ChatGPT在2022年11月30日突然发布对最大的在线编码社区Stack Overflow使用的影响。使用准实验方法（差分准差法），我们发现问题数量显著下降。此外，在ChatGPT发布后，问题的文档更加完善。最后，我们发现剩下的问题更加复杂。这些发现不仅表明了生产力的提升，而且还表明了我们工作方式的根本变化，其中AI解决了常规查询，使人们能够专注于更复杂的任务。",
    "tldr": "本研究探讨了ChatGPT对编码问题解决方式的影响，发现它显著减少了问题数量，提高了问题文档质量，以及剩下的问题更加复杂，暗示着AI不仅提升了生产力，还改变了工作方式。",
