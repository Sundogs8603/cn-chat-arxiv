    "translated_abstract": "从中国的金融文本中提取方面-观点对（AOPE）是细粒度文本情感分析中的专门任务。主要目标是同时从各种不同的金融文本中提取方面术语和观点术语。之前的研究主要集中在基于网格的模型中开发网格标注方案，以便促进提取过程。然而，这些方法通常依赖于字符级（标记级）特征编码，可能忽视了中文字符在词内的逻辑关系。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的方法，称为基于图形的字符级网格标注方案（GCGTS）。GCGTS方法使用图形卷积网络（GCN）明确地结合了句法结构，并统一了同一句法语义单元（中文词级别）内字符的编码。此外，我们将图形模型引入网格模型中，以更好地捕捉局部关系。",
