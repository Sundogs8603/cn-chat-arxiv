    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了物理信息神经网络（PINNs）在小变形弹性接触力学的正向和反向问题中的能力。我们采用混合变量形式的PINNs，并通过输出变换增强其能够强制执行迪里切特和诺依曼边界条件作为硬约束。接触问题的不等式约束（即 Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) 类型条件）通过将其纳入网络训练的损失函数中作为软约束来强制执行。为了形成KKT约束的损失函数贡献，我们研究了现有的用于弹塑性问题的方法，并探索了一种非线性互补问题（NCP）函数，即 Fischer-Burmeister 函数，它在优化方面具有有利的特性。基于赫兹接触问题，我们展示了PINNs可以作为纯偏微分方程（PDE）求解器、数据增强的前向模型和反向求解器。",
