    "translated_abstract": "基于模型的异常检测是识别网络物理生产系统预期行为偏差的成功方法。由于手动创建这些模型是一项耗时的过程，从数据中学习并以时间自动机等通用形式进行表示是有优势的。然而，由于对系统的额外信息缺乏，这些模型（以及由此检测到的异常）可能难以解释。本文旨在通过将学习到的时间自动机与关于系统的形式化知识图谱相结合来改进基于模型的网络物理生产系统的异常检测。模型和检测到的异常都在知识图谱中描述，以便操作员更容易解释模型和检测到的异常。作者还提出了必要概念的本体论。该方法在一个五罐混合网络物理生产系统上进行了验证，能够形式化地定义自动机模型和时间特性。",
