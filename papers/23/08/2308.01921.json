    "translated_abstract": "基于配体结合亲和力的药物分子快速筛选是药物发现管线中的重要步骤。图神经指纹是一种用于开发高通量和高准确性分子对接代理的有希望方法。在这项研究中，我们建立了一个包含约30万种药物候选物和23个冠状病毒蛋白靶的COVID-19药物对接数据集。利用这个数据集，我们训练了图神经指纹对接模型，用于高通量虚拟COVID-19药物筛选。图神经指纹模型在对接得分上具有很高的预测准确性，对大多数对接靶点的均方误差低于0.21 kcal/mol，相比传统圆形指纹方法有显著改进。为了使神经指纹适用于未知的靶点，我们还提出了一种在多个靶点上训练的可转移的图神经指纹方法。",
