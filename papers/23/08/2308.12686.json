    "translated_abstract": "尽管通常存在大量的无标签数据，但相关联的标签往往很少。无监督领域自适应问题旨在利用来自源领域的标签来对来自相关但不同的目标领域的数据进行分类。当涉及时间序列时，除了标准特征分布偏移之外，还会出现时间偏移的新难题。在本文中，我们介绍了Match-And-Deform（MAD）方法，该方法旨在在允许时间失真的同时在源时间序列和目标时间序列之间找到对应关系。通过最优传输损失和动态时间扭曲同时对齐了系列。当嵌入到深度神经网络中时，MAD有助于学习时间序列的新表示，既可以对齐领域又可以最大化网络的判别能力。对基准数据集和遥感数据进行的实证研究表明，MAD具有意义。",
