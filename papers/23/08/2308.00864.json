    "translated_abstract": "智能驾驶系统可以通过简单的行动来缓解拥堵，从而改善通勤时间和燃油成本等众多社会经济因素。然而，这些系统假设对自动驾驶车队具有精确的控制，因此在实际中存在限制，因为它们未能考虑到人类行为的不确定性。分段常数（PC）策略通过结构建模人类驾驶的相似性来减少交通拥堵，以提供给人类驾驶员遵循的行动建议。然而，PC策略假设所有驾驶员行为相似。为了实现这一目标，我们开发了一个基于PC策略的合作咨询系统，其中包含一种新型的驾驶员特征相关的个性化剩余策略，即PeRP。PeRP建议驾驶员以减少交通拥堵的方式行驶。我们首先使用变分自动编码器无监督地推断驾驶员如何遵循指令的内在特征。然后，通过将策略与驾驶员特征条件化，实现个性化的行动建议。",
