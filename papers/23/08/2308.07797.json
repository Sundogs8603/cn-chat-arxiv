    "translated_abstract": "在动态系统中准确估计噪声协方差矩阵（NCM）对状态估计和控制至关重要，因为它对其最优性有重要影响。尽管已经开发了大量的NCM估计方法，但大多数方法假设噪声是白噪声。然而，在许多实际应用中，噪声是有色的（例如，它们展现出时间自相关性），导致次优解。本文介绍了一种新颖的类脑算法，能够准确自适应地估计受到有色噪声影响的动态系统的NCM。具体而言，我们将动态期望最大化算法扩展为通过优化自由能目标同时进行在线噪声协方差和状态估计。我们在数值模拟实验中数学证明了我们的NCM估计器收敛到该自由能目标的全局最优解。使用随机化的数值模拟，我们展示了我们的估计器在最小噪声协方差的情况下优于其他九个基线方法。",
