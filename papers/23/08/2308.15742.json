    "translated_abstract": "当今自动语音识别（ASR）系统的普及性导致了对其可访问性的不断改善的需求。处理口吃的语音是可访问性ASR系统的重要特性。为了提高对口吃患者的ASR系统的可访问性，我们需要暴露和分析ASR系统在口吃语音上的失败。从口吃患者录制的语音数据集不足以暴露大部分的失败。此外，这些数据集缺乏关于非口吃文本的基本信息，使其不适合作为全面的测试套件。因此，需要提出一种生成模拟口吃语音并用于测试和分析ASR系统性能的方法。然而，在这种情况下，生成有效的测试输入是具有挑战性的。原因在于虽然生成的测试输入应该模仿口吃者的说话方式，但也应该具有足够的多样性以触发更多的失败。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了ASTER，一个用于测试口吃者使用的自动语音识别系统的可访问性的测试框架。",
