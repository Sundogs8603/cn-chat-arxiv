    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新型的量子预处理滤波器（QPF），以提高神经网络（NN）模型的图像分类准确性。在将数据传入全连接NN架构之前，应用了一个简单的四比特量子电路，该电路使用Y旋转门进行编码，并使用两个控制NOT门在比特之间创建相关性作为特征提取滤波器。通过应用QPF方法，结果显示基于MNIST（手写10位数字）和EMNIST（手写47类数字和字母）数据集的图像分类准确性可以提高，分别从92.5%提高到95.4%和从68.9%提高到75.9%。这些改进是在机器学习过程中没有引入额外的模型参数或优化的情况下获得的。然而，对于具有43个不同类别的真实交通标志图像的相对复杂的GTSRB数据集进行的测试显示出了分类准确性的降低。考虑到这一点，我们推测QPF方法对于复杂的图像数据可能不太适用。",
