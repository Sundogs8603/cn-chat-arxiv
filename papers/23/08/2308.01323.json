    "translated_abstract": "基因网络信息被认为对于疾病模块和通路的识别有益，但在标准的随机森林（RF）算法中尚未明确利用基因表达数据分析。我们研究了网络引导的RF的性能，在构建RF时，网络信息被总结为预测变量的采样概率，并在其中使用。我们的结果表明，网络引导的RF在疾病预测方面并不比标准RF更好。在疾病基因发现方面，如果疾病基因形成模块，则网络引导的RF可以更准确地识别它们。此外，当给定网络中的基因与疾病状态无关时，使用网络信息可能会产生虚假的基因选择结果，特别是对于中心基因。我们对来自The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)的两个平衡的微阵列和RNA-Seq乳腺癌数据集进行了实证分析，用于分类孕激素受体（PR）。",
