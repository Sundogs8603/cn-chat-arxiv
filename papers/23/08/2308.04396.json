    "translated_abstract": "流程挖掘的一个目标是从信息系统的事件日志中发现流程模型。流程挖掘已成功应用于面向流程的企业系统，但对于面向通信和文档的企业协作系统（ECS）来说不太适用。ECS事件日志非常细粒度，对其日志应用流程挖掘会导致混乱的模型。一个常见的解决方案是事件抽象，即在运行发现算法之前将低级别日志转换为更抽象的高级别日志。迄今为止，既有的事件抽象方法尚未完全解决ECS日志的特殊特征。我们旨在通过定制的ECS事件抽象（ECSEA）方法来弥补这一差距，该方法通过比较记录的实际用户活动（高级别跟踪）与系统生成的低级别跟踪（从ECS中提取）来训练模型。该模型使我们能够自动将未来的低级别跟踪转换为抽象的高级别日志。",
