The existing NLE research perspectives do not take the audience into account. An NLE can have high textual quality, but it might not accommodate audiences' needs and preference. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative perspective, \\textit{situated} NLE. On the evaluation side, we set up automated evaluation scores. These scores describe the properties of NLEs in lexical, semantic, and pragmatic categories. On the generation side, we identify three prompt engineering techniques and assess their applicability on the situations. Situated NLE provides a perspective and facilitates further research on the generation and evaluation of explanations.",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言是向人类解释决策最易理解的工具之一，而大型预训练语言模型（PLMs）已经展示出生成连贯的自然语言解释（NLE）的能力。现有的NLE研究观点没有考虑受众的因素。一个NLE可以具有高质量的文本，但可能不符合受众的需求和喜好。为了解决这一局限性，我们提出了一个替代性视角，即\\textit{坐标}NLE。在评估方面，我们建立了自动化评估分数。这些分数描述了NLE在词汇、语义和语用类别上的属性。在生成方面，我们确定了三种提示工程技术，并评估它们在各种情况下的适用性。坐标NLE提供了一种视角，促进了关于解释生成和评估的进一步研究。",
