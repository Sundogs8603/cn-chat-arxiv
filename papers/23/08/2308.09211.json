    "abstract": "This paper studies how improved monitoring affects the limit equilibrium payoff set for stochastic games with imperfect public monitoring. We introduce a simple generalization of Blackwell garbling called weighted garbling in order to compare different information structures for this class of games. Our main result is the monotonicity of the limit perfect public equilibrium (PPE) payoff set with respect to this information order: we show that the limit PPE payoff sets with one information structure is larger than the limit PPE payoff sets with another information structure state by state if the latter information structure is a weighted garbling of the former. We show that this monotonicity result also holds for the class of strongly symmetric equilibrium. Finally, we introduce and discuss another weaker sufficient condition for the expansion of limit PPE payoff set. It is more complex and difficult to verify, but useful in some special cases.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了改进监测如何影响不完全公开监测的随机博弈的极限均衡收益集。我们引入了一个简单的Blackwell混淆的推广，称为加权混淆，以便比较这类博弈的不同信息结构。我们的主要结果是极限完美公开均衡（PPE）收益集相对于这种信息顺序的单调性：我们证明了如果后一种信息结构是前一种信息结构的加权混淆，则按状态比较后一种信息结构的极限PPE收益集要大于前一种信息结构的极限PPE收益集。我们还证明了这种单调性结果在强对称均衡类中也成立。最后，我们引入并讨论了另一个较弱的足够条件，用于扩展极限PPE收益集。尽管更加复杂和难以验证，但在某些特殊情况下很有用。",

By introducing weighted garbling as a generalization of Blackwell garbling, the monotonicity of the limit perfect public equilibrium payoff set is proved with respect to this information order. Another weaker condition for the expansion of the limit payoff set is also discussed."
