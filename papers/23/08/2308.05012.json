    "abstract": "Transit riders' feedback provided in ridership surveys, customer relationship management (CRM) channels, and in more recent times, through social media is key for transit agencies to better gauge the efficacy of their services and initiatives. Getting a holistic understanding of riders' experience through the feedback shared in those instruments is often challenging, mostly due to the open-ended, unstructured nature of text feedback. In this paper, we propose leveraging traditional transit CRM feedback to develop and deploy a transit-topic-aware large language model (LLM) capable of classifying open-ended text feedback to relevant transit-specific topics. First, we utilize semi-supervised learning to engineer a training dataset of 11 broad transit topics detected in a corpus of 6 years of customer feedback provided to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). We then use this dataset to train and thoroughly evaluate a language model based on the RoBERTa architecture. ",

    "translated_abstract": "乘客在乘车调查、客户关系管理（CRM）渠道以及最近的社交媒体上提供的反馈是交通机构更好地评估其服务和计划有效性的关键。通过这些工具共享的反馈来获得对乘客体验的整体理解常常具有挑战性，主要是由于文本反馈的开放性和非结构化性质。在本文中，我们提出利用传统的交通CRM反馈来开发和应用能够将开放性文本反馈分类到相关的交通特定主题中的交通主题感知大语言模型（LLM）。首先，我们利用半监督学习在华盛顿都会区交通局（WMATA）的6年顾客反馈语料库中检测到的11个广泛交通主题构建一个训练数据集。然后，我们使用该数据集来训练并全面评估基于RoBERTa架构的语言模型。",
