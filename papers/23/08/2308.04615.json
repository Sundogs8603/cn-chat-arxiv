    "translated_abstract": "在过去的几年中，引入了深度学习（DL）技术来设计稀疏数组。这些方法具有特征工程和低预测阶段复杂性的优势，在解决寻找稀疏数组的组合搜索问题方面非常有帮助。在本文中，我们提供了基于DL稀疏数组的多个方向找寻应用的概要。我们首先研究了在认知雷达应用中选择稀疏数组的监督和迁移学习技术。在这里，我们还讨论了使用模拟退火等元启发式学习算法来设计二维稀疏数组的情况。接下来，我们考虑了用于无线通信的DL基础天线选择，在其中稀疏数组问题也可以与信道估计、波束成形或定位相结合。最后，我们提供了一个用于综合感知和通信（ISAC）应用的深度稀疏数组技术的例子。",
