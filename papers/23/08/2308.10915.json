    "translated_abstract": "数据预处理是机器学习过程中的关键步骤，它将原始数据转化为对下游机器学习模型更可用的格式。然而，这个过程往往耗时且代价高昂，通常需要领域专家的专门知识。现有的自动化机器学习 (AutoML) 框架声称可以自动化数据预处理。然而，它们通常使用了受限的数据预处理管道搜索空间，这限制了潜在的性能提升，并且由于需要多次训练机器学习模型，它们通常速度过慢。在本文中，我们提出了 DiffPrep，一种可以自动且高效地搜索给定表格数据集和可微分机器学习模型的数据预处理管道的方法，以最大化机器学习模型的性能。我们将数据预处理管道搜索问题形式化为一个双层优化问题。为了高效解决这个问题，我们将离散的非可微搜索空间转化并放松为连续的空间。",
