    "abstract": "We consider the problem of estimating the false-/ true-positive-rate (FPR/TPR) for a binary classification model when there are incorrect labels (label noise) in the validation set. Our motivating application is fraud prevention where accurate estimates of FPR are critical to preserving the experience for good customers, and where label noise is highly asymmetric. Existing methods seek to minimize the total error in the cleaning process - to avoid cleaning examples that are not noise, and to ensure cleaning of examples that are. This is an important measure of accuracy but insufficient to guarantee good estimates of the true FPR or TPR for a model, and we show that using the model to directly clean its own validation data leads to underestimates even if total error is low. This indicates a need for researchers to pursue methods that not only reduce total error but also seek to de-correlate cleaning error with model scores.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了在验证集中存在错误标签（标签噪音）的情况下，对二分类模型的假阳性率（FPR）/真阳性率（TPR）的估计问题。我们的动机应用是欺诈预防，在这种情况下，准确估计FPR对于保护好客户的体验至关重要，而标签噪音具有高度的不对称性。现有方法旨在最小化清理过程中的总误差 - 避免清理非噪音的示例，并确保清理噪音示例。这是一个重要的准确性度量，但不足以保证模型的真实FPR或TPR的良好估计，我们表明，即使总误差较低，使用模型直接清理自己的验证数据也会导致低估。这表明，研究人员需要追求不仅减少总误差，还需要寻求使清理误差与模型分数解耦的方法。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了在存在标签噪音的情况下，估计二分类模型的FPR以及TPR的方法，这对于欺诈检测中的准确性至关重要。作者发现，现有的方法虽然减小了总误差，却不能保证模型对FPR和TPR的估计准确，因此提出了一种使清理误差与模型分数解耦的方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method for estimating the FPR and TPR of a binary classification model in the presence of label noise, which is crucial for accuracy in fraud detection. The authors find that existing methods, although reducing total error, cannot guarantee accurate estimates of FPR and TPR, thus suggesting a need for a method that decouples cleaning error from model scores."
