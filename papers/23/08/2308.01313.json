    "translated_abstract": "CLIP作为一种基础的视觉语言模型，由于其理解各种视觉概念和自然语言描述的能力，被广泛应用于零样本图像分类。然而，如何充分利用CLIP的前所未有的人类般理解能力来实现更好的零样本分类仍然是一个开放问题。本文从人类的视觉感知过程中得到启发：现代神经科学观点认为，在对物体进行分类时，人类首先推断其与类别无关的属性（如背景和方向），这有助于将前景对象与背景区分开来，然后以此信息为基础进行决策。受此启发，我们观察到为CLIP提供上下文属性可以改善零样本分类并减轻对虚假特征的依赖。我们还观察到CLIP本身可以合理地从图像中推断出这些属性。基于这些观察，我们提出了一种零训练、两步骤的零样本分类方法。",
