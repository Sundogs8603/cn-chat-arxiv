    "abstract": "We have studied the parametric description of the distribution of the log-growth rates of the sizes of cities of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the USA. We have considered several parametric distributions well known in the literature as well as some others recently introduced. There are some models that provide similar excellent performance, for all studied samples. The normal distribution is not the one observed empirically.",
