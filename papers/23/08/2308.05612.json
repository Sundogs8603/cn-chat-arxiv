    "abstract": "In today's chemical production plants, human field operators perform frequent checks on the plant's integrity to guarantee high safety standards, and thus are possibly the first to encounter dangerous operating conditions. To alleviate their tasks of failure detection and monitoring by audio, visual, and olfactory perceptions, we present a robotic system that consists of an autonomously navigating robot integrated with various sensors and data processing. We aim to resemble the human sensing and interpretation capabilities of sight, smell, and hearing, for providing automated inspection. We evaluate our system extensively at a wastewater facility in full working conditions. Our results demonstrate that the system is able to robustly navigate a plant and to provide useful information about critical operating conditions.",
