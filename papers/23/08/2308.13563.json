    "abstract": "In traffic safety research, extracting information from crash narratives using text analysis is a common practice. With recent advancements of large language models (LLM), it would be useful to know how the popular LLM interfaces perform in classifying or extracting information from crash narratives. To explore this, our study has used the three most popular publicly available LLM interfaces- ChatGPT, BARD and GPT4. This study investigated their usefulness and boundaries in extracting information and answering queries related to accidents from 100 crash narratives from Iowa and Kansas. During the investigation, their capabilities and limitations were assessed and their responses to the queries were compared. Five questions were asked related to the narratives: 1) Who is at-fault? 2) What is the manner of collision? 3) Has the crash occurred in a work-zone? 4) Did the crash involve pedestrians? and 5) What are the sequence of harmful events in the crash? For questions 1 through 4, the o",

    "translated_abstract": "在交通安全研究中，使用文本分析从事故叙述中提取信息是一种常见的做法。随着大型语言模型（LLM）的最新进展，了解流行的LLM接口在分类或从事故叙述中提取信息方面的表现将非常有用。为了探索这一问题，我们的研究使用了目前最流行的三个公开可用的LLM接口——ChatGPT、BARD和GPT4。本研究调查了它们在提取信息和回答与事故有关的查询方面的有效性和限制。研究从爱荷华州和堪萨斯州的100个事故叙述中提取信息，并对它们的能力和限制进行了评估，比较了它们对查询的响应。五个与叙述相关的问题被提出：1）谁是责任方？2）碰撞方式是什么？3）事故发生在工作区吗？4）事故涉及行人吗？5）事故中有害事件的顺序是什么？对于第1到第4个问题，三个LLM接口的回答都经过了比较。",
