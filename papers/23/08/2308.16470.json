    "translated_abstract": "近来，跨网络节点分类(CNNC)吸引了越来越多的关注，旨在通过从具有丰富标签的源网络中转移知识，对标签不充分的目标网络中的节点进行分类。为了解决CNNC问题，我们提出了一种结合了图神经网络(GNN)和条件对抗领域自适应的领域自适应消息传递图神经网络(DM-GNN)，能够学习可传递的节点分类信息。首先，通过双特征提取器构建了GNN编码器，将自我嵌入学习与邻居嵌入学习分离，以共同捕捉连接节点之间的共性和差异。其次，提出了一种标签传播节点分类器，通过将节点自身预测和邻居预测相结合来细化每个节点的标签预测。此外，针对有标签源网络设计了标签感知的传播方案，以促进标签的传播。",
