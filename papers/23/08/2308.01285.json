    "translated_abstract": "最近人工智能领域取得的进展已经产生了高度能力和可控性的系统。这为结构化推理以及多个人工智能系统和人类之间的协作创造了前所未有的机遇。为了充分实现这一潜力，必须开发一种有原则的方法来设计和研究这样的结构化交互。为此，我们引入了流程的概念框架：一种系统化的建模复杂交互的方法。流程是计算的自包含构建模块，具有独立的状态，并通过标准化的基于消息的接口进行通信。这种模块化设计使得流程可以递归地组合成任意嵌套的交互，大大降低了复杂性。关键是，任何交互都可以使用这个框架来实现，包括之前关于人工智能-人工智能和人类-人工智能交互、提示工程方案和工具增强的工作。我们展示了流程在任务上的潜力。",
