    "abstract": "Cycling stress assessment, which quantifies cyclists' perceived stress imposed by the built environment and motor traffics, increasingly informs cycling infrastructure planning and cycling route recommendation. However, currently calculating cycling stress is slow and data-intensive, which hinders its broader application. In this paper, We propose a deep learning framework to support accurate, fast, and large-scale cycling stress assessments for urban road networks based on street-view images. Our framework features i) a contrastive learning approach that leverages the ordinal relationship among cycling stress labels, and ii) a post-processing technique that enforces spatial smoothness into our predictions. On a dataset of 39,153 road segments collected in Toronto, Canada, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our deep learning framework and the value of using image data for cycling stress assessment in the absence of high-quality road geometry and motor traffic data.",

    "translated_abstract": "骑行压力评估是一种衡量骑行者受到建筑环境和汽车交通影响的主观压力的方法，它越来越多地用于骑行基础设施规划和骑行路线推荐。然而，目前计算骑行压力的方法速度慢且需要大量数据，这限制了其更广泛的应用。本文提出了一个基于街景图像的深度学习框架，支持准确、快速和大规模的城市道路网络骑行压力评估。我们的框架具有以下特点：i）利用骑行压力标签的序关系进行对比学习；ii）使用后处理技术将空间平滑性纳入我们的预测中。在加拿大多伦多收集的39,153个道路段数据集上，我们的结果证明了我们的深度学习框架的有效性，以及在缺乏高质量的道路几何和汽车交通数据时使用图像数据进行骑行压力评估的价值。",
