    "translated_abstract": "通过探索多个图之间的互补信息和一致信息，无监督的多重复合图学习方法（UMGL）已被证明在不同的下游任务中取得了显著的效果。然而，先前的方法通常忽视了实际应用中的问题，即样本外问题和噪声问题。为了解决上述问题，在本文中，我们提出了一种有效且高效的UMGL方法来探索互补和一致的信息。为此，我们的方法采用了多个MLP编码器而不是图卷积网络（GCN）来进行表示学习，同时具有两个约束条件：保留节点之间的局部图结构以处理样本外问题，并最大化多个节点表示之间的相关性以处理噪声问题。全面的实验证明，我们提出的方法在效果和效率上优于比较方法，并且能够有效地处理噪声。",
