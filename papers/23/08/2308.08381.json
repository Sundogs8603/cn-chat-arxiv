Reject curves allow to evaluate and compare the performance of different certainty measures over a range of thresholds for accepting or rejecting classifications. However, the accuracy may not be the most suited evaluation metric for all applications, and instead precision or recall may be preferable. This is the case, for example, for data with imbalanced class distributions. We therefore propose reject curves that evaluate precision and recall, the recall-reject curve and the precision-reject curve. Using prototype-based classifiers from learning vector quantization, we first validate the proposed curves on artificial benchmark data against the accuracy reject curve as a baseline.

    "translated_abstract": "在某些分类场景中，只使用模型高度确定的分类实例是可取的。为了获得这些高度确定的实例，先前的研究提出了准确度拒绝曲线。拒绝曲线允许评估和比较不同的确定度度量在接受或拒绝分类的一系列阈值上的性能。然而，准确度可能并不适合所有应用程序的评估指标，相反，精确度或召回率可能更可取。这是因为在存在类别分布不平衡的数据中，例如，在不平衡的基准数据和医学实际数据中，我们提出了评估精确度和召回率的拒绝曲线：召回率-拒绝曲线和精确度-拒绝曲线。通过学习向量量化中的原型分类器，我们首先在人工基准数据上将提出的曲线与准确度拒绝曲线作为基准进行验证。然后，我们在存在类别分布不平衡的基准数据和医学实际数据上进行展示。",
