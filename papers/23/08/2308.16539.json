However, its applicability in real-world robotics applications is hindered by several challenges, such as unknown agents' preferences and goals. To address these challenges, we show a connection between differential games, optimal control, and energy-based models and demonstrate how existing approaches can be unified under our proposed Energy-based Potential Game formulation. Building upon this formulation, this work introduces a new end-to-end learning application that combines neural networks for game-parameter inference with a differentiable game-theoretic optimization layer, acting as an inductive bias. The experiments using simulated mobile robot pedestrian interactions and real-world automated driving data provide empirical evidence that the game-theoretic layer improves the predictive performance of various neural network backbones.",

    "translated_abstract": "博弈论提供了一个可解释的数学框架，用于建模多智能体的相互作用。然而，在现实世界中的机器人应用中，博弈论的适用性受到多个挑战的阻碍，比如未知的智能体偏好和目标。为了解决这些挑战，我们展示了微分博弈、最优控制和基于能量的模型之间的联系，并展示了如何将现有方法统一到我们提出的基于能量的潜在博弈的形式化中。在这个形式化的基础上，本文引入了一种新的端到端学习应用，将神经网络用于博弈参数推断，并通过可微分的博弈论优化层作为归纳偏好。使用模拟的移动机器人行人相互作用和真实世界中的自动驾驶数据的实验证据表明，博弈论层改善了各种神经网络主干的预测性能。",
