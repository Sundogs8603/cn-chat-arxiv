    "translated_abstract": "回声消除和噪声抑制对于全双工通信至关重要，然而大多数现有的神经网络在计算成本高和模型复杂度调整上不灵活。在本文中，我们引入时间频率双路径压缩，实现广泛的压缩比，同时降低计算成本。具体来说，在频率压缩方面，使用可训练滤波器代替手动设计的滤波器进行维度缩减。在时间压缩方面，仅使用帧跳预测会导致性能大幅下降，但通过具有完整序列建模的后处理网络可以缓解这个问题。我们发现，在固定压缩比的情况下，同时使用时间和频率方法进行双路径压缩将进一步改善性能，并且几乎不改变模型大小，压缩比覆盖范围从4x到32x。此外，所提出的模型与快速FullSubNet和DeepFilterNet相比具有竞争力的性能。可以访问演示页面。",
