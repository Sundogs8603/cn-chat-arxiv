    "abstract": "Current approaches for text summarization are predominantly automatic, with rather limited space for human intervention and control over the process. In this paper, we introduce SummHelper, a 2-phase summarization assistant designed to foster human-machine collaboration. The initial phase involves content selection, where the system recommends potential content, allowing users to accept, modify, or introduce additional selections. The subsequent phase, content consolidation, involves SummHelper generating a coherent summary from these selections, which users can then refine using visual mappings between the summary and the source text. Small-scale user studies reveal the effectiveness of our application, with participants being especially appreciative of the balance between automated guidance and opportunities for personal input.",

    "translated_abstract": "当前的文本摘要方法主要是自动化的，对人类干预和控制的空间有限。本文介绍了SummHelper，一个两阶段的摘要辅助系统，旨在促进人机协作。初始阶段涉及内容选择，系统推荐潜在内容，允许用户接受、修改或引入其他选择。随后的内容整合阶段，SummHelper从这些选择中生成一个连贯的摘要，用户可以利用摘要与源文本之间的可视映射进行优化。小规模用户研究显示我们的应用程序的有效性，参与者特别赞赏自动引导和个人输入机会之间的平衡。",
