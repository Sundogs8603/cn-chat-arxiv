    "translated_abstract": "基于Transformer的模型在各种语言任务的性能上取得了革命性的突破。直观上，人们可能会期望文本分类，作为不需要像生成任务那样许多高级表示的任务，能够充分利用Transformer强大的表示能力来进行综合性的处理。然而，实际上，在多类别和多标签分类长文本文档和其他大文件的领域仍然存在较大的改进潜力。Transformer模型的性能主要受到一个重要限制的阻碍：有限的输入长度，比如BERT的512个标记。虽然增加GPU内存可以稍微扩展这个限制，但实际应用中往往受限于有限的GPU资源。在这项工作中，我们从相关多实例学习的角度解决了输入限制问题。所提出的方法LaFiCMIL，作为一个多功能的框架，适用于",
