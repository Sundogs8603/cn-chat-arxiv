    "abstract": "Advanced video technologies are driving the development of the futuristic Metaverse, which aims to connect users from anywhere and anytime. As such, the use cases for users will be much more diverse, leading to a mix of 360-degree videos with two types: non-VR and VR 360-degree videos. This paper presents a novel Quality of Service model for heterogeneous 360-degree videos with different requirements for frame rates and cybersickness. We propose a frame-slotted structure and conduct frame-wise optimization using self-designed differentiated deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Specifically, we design two structures, Separate Input Differentiated Output (SIDO) and Merged Input Differentiated Output (MIDO), for this heterogeneous scenario. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate their effectiveness.",

    "translated_abstract": "先进的视频技术推动着未来元宇宙的发展，旨在连接从任何地方的用户。因此，用户的使用场景将更加多样化，导致了非VR和VR 360度视频的混合。本文提出了一种新颖的为具有不同帧率和晕动症要求的异构360度视频设计的服务质量模型。我们提出了一种帧隙结构，并使用自行设计的差异化深度强化学习算法进行逐帧优化。具体而言，我们设计了两种结构，即分离输入差异输出（SIDO）和合并输入差异输出（MIDO），用于处理这种异构场景。我们还进行了全面的实验以证明其有效性。",
