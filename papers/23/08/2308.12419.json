    "translated_abstract": "手语是聋人之间通过手势传达意思的主要交流方式。在自然环境中识别手语面临着诸多挑战，如光照、背景杂乱和手势者特征的变化等。本论文研究了在野外环境中的自动手语处理，使用了从互联网收集的手语视频。本论文提供了新的数据集、任务和方法。大部分章节涉及手指拼写任务，这是手语的重要组成部分，但之前的研究并没有广泛研究。我提出了三个新的大规模手语数据集：ChicagoFSWild、ChicagoFSWild+和OpenASL。使用ChicagoFSWild和ChicagoFSWild+，我解决了手指拼写识别问题，即将手指拼写序列转录为文本。我提出了一种基于迭代注意力的端到端方法，可以从原始视频中识别手指拼写，而不需要显式手部检测。",
