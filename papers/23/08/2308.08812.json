Variational Priors represent abstract shapes and combat forgetting, whereas saliency maps preserve object attributes with less memory usage.

    "translated_abstract": "单图像三维重建是研究如何根据单视角图像预测三维物体形状的一个挑战。这个任务需要大量数据获取来预测形状的可见和遮挡部分。此外，基于学习的方法面临创建针对所有可能类别的全面训练数据集的困难。为此，我们提出了一种基于连续学习的三维重建方法，我们的目标是设计一个使用变分先验的模型，即使在训练新类别后仍可以合理重建以前见过的类别。变分先验代表抽象形状并避免遗忘，而显著性图以较少的内存使用保留对象属性。这对于存储大量训练数据的资源限制至关重要。此外，我们引入了基于显著性图的经验重放，以捕捉全局和独特的对象特征。详细的实验显示与已建立方法相比具有竞争力的结果。",
