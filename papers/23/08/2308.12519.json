    "translated_abstract": "虽然大型语言模型(LLMs)展示了令人印象深刻的语言理解和上下文学习能力，但它们在解决现实世界任务时仍严重依赖于专家知识的指导。为了发挥LLMs作为自主决策者的潜力，本文提出了一种称为JuDec的方法，赋予LLMs自我判断的能力，使其能够实现自主判断和决策探索。具体而言，在JuDec中，设计了基于Elo的自我判断机制，通过对两个解决方案进行配对比较，为决策步骤分配Elo分数，以判断它们的价值和效用，并相应地引导决策搜索过程朝向最优解。在ToolBench数据集上的实验结果表明，JuDec相对于基准模型具有优势，在不同任务上的通过率提高了10%以上。它提供了更高质量的解决方案并降低了成本(ChatGPT API调用)。",
