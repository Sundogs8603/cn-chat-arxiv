    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting developments in Computer Science of the last decade. At the same time, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a very successful paradigm for a variety of machine learning tasks. In this survey, we discuss the state of the art, opportunities and open research questions in applying RL to generative AI. In particular, we will discuss three types of applications, namely, RL as an alternative way for generation without specified objectives; as a way for generating outputs while concurrently maximizing an objective function; and, finally, as a way of embedding desired characteristics, which cannot be easily captured by means of an objective function, into the generative process. We conclude the survey with an in-depth discussion of the opportunities and challenges in this fascinating emerging area.",

    "translated_abstract": "生成人工智能（AI）是近十年来计算机科学领域最令人兴奋的发展之一。与此同时，强化学习（RL）在各种机器学习任务中已经成为非常成功的范式。在本调查中，我们讨论了将RL应用于生成AI中的现状、机会和开放的研究问题。具体而言，我们将讨论三种应用类型，即作为一种无特定目标的生成方式，作为一种同时最大化目标函数的输出生成方式，以及作为一种将无法通过目标函数轻松捕捉的期望特征嵌入生成过程的方式。我们在调查结果中对这个迷人的新兴领域中的机会和挑战进行了深入的讨论。",
