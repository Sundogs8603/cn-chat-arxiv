    "translated_abstract": "考虑到多个拥有敏感数据的方在合作学习群体级别统计数据时，无法合并敏感数据集的情况。我们提出了一个框架，其中每个方分享其数据的差分隐私合成对。我们研究了在来自英国生物数据库的真实世界健康数据上结合这种合成对数据进行协作学习的可行性。我们发现通过共享合成数据进行协作学习的方，相比仅使用本地数据，可以获得更准确的目标统计估计。这一发现同样适用于小型异构数据集的复杂情况。此外，参与方越多，改进的规模和一致性越大。最后，我们发现数据共享可以帮助包含少数群体的数据的方更好地进行调整分析。基于我们的结果，我们得出结论：共享合成数据可以在保护隐私的同时促进分布式协作学习。",

The feasibility of this framework is validated through experiments with real-world health data. The findings show that collaborative learning through shared synthetic data leads to more accurate statistical estimates, particularly benefiting parties with underrepresented groups in their data."
