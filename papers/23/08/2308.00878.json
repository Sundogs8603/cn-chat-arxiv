    "translated_abstract": "对话行为注释对于改善任务导向对话系统中的响应生成质量非常重要。然而，由于不同的数据集和任务可能具有不兼容的注释，使用对话行为以通用的方式控制响应生成可能具有挑战性。虽然利用潜在动作空间或强化学习的替代方法不需要显式注释，但可能缺乏解释性或遇到定义任务特定奖励的困难。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的端到端潜在对话行为模型（DiactTOD），该模型将对话行为表示为潜在空间中的向量。DiactTOD在大型语料库上预训练后，能够使用这些潜在表示预测和控制对话行为，以零-shot的方式生成可控的响应。我们的方法在MultiWOZ数据集的各种实验设置中展示了最先进的性能，包括零-shot、少-shot和完整数据微调。",
