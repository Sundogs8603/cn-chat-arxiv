    "abstract": "Objective: BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) technology operates in three modes: online, offline, and pseudo-online. In the online mode, real-time EEG data is constantly analyzed. In offline mode, the signal is acquired and processed afterwards. The pseudo-online mode processes collected data as if they were received in real-time. The main difference is that the offline mode often analyzes the whole data, while the online and pseudo-online modes only analyze data in short time windows. Offline analysis is usually done with asynchronous BCIs, which restricts analysis to predefined time windows. Asynchronous BCI, compatible with online and pseudo-online modes, allows flexible mental activity duration. Offline processing tends to be more accurate, while online analysis is better for therapeutic applications. Pseudo-online implementation approximates online processing without real-time constraints. Many BCI studies being offline introduce biases compared to real-life scenarios, impacting clas",

    "translated_abstract": "BCI（脑机接口）技术有三种操作模式：在线、离线和伪在线。在线模式下，实时的脑电数据被持续分析。离线模式下，信号在采集后进行处理。伪在线模式下，采集到的数据被处理成仿真实时接收的形式。主要区别在于离线模式经常分析整个数据，而在线和伪在线模式只分析短时间窗口的数据。离线分析通常与异步BCI一起使用，这限制了分析到预定义的时间窗口。与在线和伪在线模式兼容的异步BCI允许灵活的思维活动持续时间。离线处理往往更准确，而在线分析则更适用于治疗应用。伪在线实现近似于无实时约束的在线处理。许多离线的BCI研究相对于真实环境中的情景引入了偏差，影响了分类结果。",
