    "translated_abstract": "多元时间序列（MVTS）的异常检测是一个长期存在且具有挑战性的研究课题，近年来吸引了工业界和学术界的大量研究努力。然而，对文献的仔细研究让我们意识到：1）该领域的社区活跃，但并不像计算机视觉（CV）和自然语言处理（NLP）等其他机器学习领域那样组织有序；2）大多数提出的解决方案使用不合适或存在明显缺陷的评估协议进行评估，缺乏科学基础。其中一个非常流行的协议，即所谓的 \\pa 协议，是如此有缺陷，以至于随机猜测可以显示系统地优于迄今为止开发的\\emph{所有}算法。在本文中，我们使用更健壮的协议对许多最近的算法进行回顾和评估，并讨论在MVTS异常检测的背景下，一个本来很好的协议可能存在的问题以及如何减轻这些问题。我们还对基准数据集表达了关切。",
    "tldr": "多元时间序列异常检测是一个研究领域，但目前存在组织不够有序和评估协议有缺陷的问题。文章评估了许多最近算法的性能，并指出了针对多元时间序列异常检测的评估协议存在的问题及如何缓解这些问题的方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "Multivariate Time Series (MVTS) anomaly detection is an important research field, but currently, there are issues with disorganized community and flawed evaluation protocols. This paper evaluates recent algorithms and highlights the problems with evaluation protocols in MVTS anomaly detection and suggests ways to mitigate them."
