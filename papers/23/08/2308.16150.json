    "translated_abstract": "无监督异常分割旨在检测与训练过程中处理的任何模式不同的模式，通常称为异常或超出分布的模式，而不提供任何关联的手动分割。由于部署过程中的异常可能导致模型失效，检测异常可以增强模型的可靠性，这在医学成像等高风险领域非常有价值。本文引入了基于遮蔽模态循环与条件扩散（MMCCD）的方法，该方法能够在多模态MRI中分割各种模式的异常。该方法基于两个基本思想。首先，我们提出使用循环模态转换作为启用异常检测的机制。图像转换模型学习组织特异的模态映射，这是组织生理学的特征。因此，这些学习到的映射无法将在训练过程中从未遇到的组织或图像模式进行转换，从而产生错误，使得异常能够被检测到。",
