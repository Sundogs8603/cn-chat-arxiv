    "translated_abstract": "一组变量之间的经典因果关系可以在观察变量和潜在变量之间导致相等约束（通常是条件独立）和不等约束（仪器不等式和贝尔不等式是典型示例），从而使它们之间的分布在观察变量上具有一定的约束性。列举一个因果结构所隐含的不等式约束通常比列举它的等式约束更困难。此外，只有不等式约束才能被量子相关性违反。由于这两个原因，将因果场景分类为具有不等式约束和不具有不等式约束的场景是重要的。在这里，我们通过使用d分离、e分离和不相容支持的方法来检测这些场景。许多（也许全部？）仅具有等式约束的场景可以通过Henson，Lal和Pusey（HLP）提出的条件来检测。考虑到最多4个被观察到的场景。",
