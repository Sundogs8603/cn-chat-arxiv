    "translated_abstract": "纳米抗体(Nb)是来源于骆驼和鲨鱼等动物的单体重链抗体片段。它们的尺寸相对较小（约3-4 nm；13 kDa）且具有良好的生物物理性质，因此成为重组生产的吸引人的目标。此外，纳米抗体具有选择性地结合到特定的抗原，如毒素、化学物质、细菌和病毒，使其成为细胞生物学、结构生物学、医学诊断以及治疗癌症和其他严重疾病的有力工具。然而，纳米抗体在大多数抗原上是不可获得的，这是纳米抗体生产中的一个关键挑战。尽管已经提出一些计算方法来筛选与给定目标抗原相配的潜在纳米抗体，但是由于依赖于3D结构，它们的实际应用受到了严格限制。此外，预测纳米抗体-抗原相互作用（结合）是一项耗时且劳动密集的任务。本研究针对这些问题进行了研究。",
    "tldr": "本研究旨在解决纳米抗体生产中的关键挑战，即缺乏与大多数抗原相匹配的纳米抗体。研究针对此问题提出了一种基于序列的方法来预测纳米抗体-抗原的结合。此方法不依赖于3D结构，并且能够提高纳米抗体的生产效率。"
