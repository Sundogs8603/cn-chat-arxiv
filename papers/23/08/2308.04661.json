    "abstract": "Matrix factorization (MF) is a classical collaborative filtering algorithm for recommender systems.

    "translated_abstract": "矩阵分解(MF)是一种经典的协同过滤算法，用于推荐系统。它将用户-项目交互矩阵分解为低维用户表示矩阵和项目表示矩阵的乘积。在典型的推荐场景中，用户-项目交互模式通常是一个两阶段过程，并且需要对获得的用户和项目表示进行静态聚类分析。然而，上述过程需要大量的时间和计算资源，因此很难应用于具有数十亿用户和数万亿项目的电子商务或物联网环境中。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于动态多视图聚类(MFDMC)的统一矩阵分解方法，采用端到端的训练范式。具体而言，在每个视图中，用户/项目表示被视为所有聚类的加权投影。每个聚类的表示是可学习的，可以动态丢弃不好的聚类。",
