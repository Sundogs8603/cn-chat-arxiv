    "translated_abstract": "在深度学习的各种场景中，会自然地出现不同的冲突优化准则。这些准则可以解决不同的主任务（如多任务学习设置），也可以解决主要任务和次要任务，例如损失最小化与稀疏性。通常的方法是简单地加权准则，但在凸设置中才有效。本文提出了一种多目标优化算法，对多任务深度神经网络（DNNs）进行训练，使用改进的加权Chebyshev标量化方法。通过使用这种标量化技术，算法可以识别原始问题的所有最优解，同时将其复杂性降低为一系列单目标问题。然后，使用增广Lagrangian方法来解决简化后的问题，从而可以使用常见的优化技术，如Adam和随机梯度下降，同时有效地处理约束条件。我们的工作旨在解决经济化问题。",
