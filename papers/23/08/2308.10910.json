    "translated_abstract": "尽管多模态学习在MRI重建中得到广泛应用，但它依赖于难以在实际临床场景中获取的成对多模态数据。特别是在联合学习的情况下，常见情况是几个医疗机构只有单模态数据，即称为模态缺失问题。因此，在这种条件下无法部署标准的联合学习框架。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的通信高效的联合学习框架，即Fed-PMG，以解决联合多模态MRI重建中的模态缺失挑战。具体来说，我们利用一种伪模态生成机制通过在频率空间中共享幅度谱的分布信息来恢复每个单模态客户端的丢失模态。然而，共享原始幅度谱的步骤会导致沉重的通信成本。为了降低通信成本，我们引入了聚类方案来进行投影。",

By utilizing a pseudo modality generation mechanism to recover the missing modality for each single-modal client, the communication efficiency is improved. The need for paired multi-modal data is avoided by sharing the distribution information of the amplitude spectrum in frequency space."
