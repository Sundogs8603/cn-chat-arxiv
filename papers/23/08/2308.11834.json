    "translated_abstract": "在真实世界应用中，贝叶斯分类器在每个特征完全独立于其他特征时表现良好，但这种情况并不总是成立。本研究旨在实现并比较贝叶斯分类器的各个变体（多项式、伯努利和高斯）在网络入侵异常检测中的性能，并研究每个变体的假设与性能之间是否存在关联。我们的研究发现，贝叶斯算法的每个变体都盲目地遵循其假设，而不考虑特征的属性，假设是影响准确性的最重要因素。实验结果显示，伯努利在测试集上的准确率为69.9%（训练集为71%），多项式在测试集上的准确率为31.2%（训练集为31.2%），而高斯在测试集上的准确率为81.69%（训练集为82.84%）。进一步研究发现，每个朴素贝叶斯变体的性能和准确性主要取决于每个分类器的假设。",
