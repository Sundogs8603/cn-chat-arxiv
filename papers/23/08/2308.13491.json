    "abstract": "Head-to-head autonomous racing is a challenging problem, as the vehicle needs to operate at the friction or handling limits in order to achieve minimum lap times while also actively looking for strategies to overtake/stay ahead of the opponent. In this work we propose a head-to-head racing environment for reinforcement learning which accurately models vehicle dynamics. Some previous works have tried learning a policy directly in the complex vehicle dynamics environment but have failed to learn an optimal policy. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning-based framework by transitioning from a simpler vehicle model to a more complex real environment to teach the reinforcement learning agent a policy closer to the optimal policy. We also propose a control barrier function-based safe reinforcement learning algorithm to enforce the safety of the agent in a more effective way while not compromising on optimality.",

    "translated_abstract": "一对一自主赛车是一个具有挑战性的问题，车辆需要在摩擦或操控极限下运行，以实现最短的圈速，同时还要积极寻找超车/保持领先的策略。在本研究中，我们提出了一个用于强化学习的一对一赛车环境，能够准确地模拟车辆动力学。一些先前的研究尝试直接在复杂的车辆动力学环境中学习策略，但未能学到最优策略。在本研究中，我们提出了一个基于课程学习的框架，通过从较简单的车辆模型过渡到更复杂的真实环境，将强化学习智能体的策略训练得更接近最优策略。同时，我们还提出了一个基于控制屏障函数的安全强化学习算法，以更有效地保证智能体的安全性而不损害最优性。",
