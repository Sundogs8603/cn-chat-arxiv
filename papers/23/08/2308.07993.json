    "abstract": "This paper examines the mode choice behaviour of people who may act as occasional couriers to provide crowd-shipping (CS) deliveries. Given its recent increase in popularity, online grocery services have become the main market for crowd-shipping deliveries' provider. The study included a behavioural survey, PTV Visum simulations and discrete choice behaviour modelling based on random utility maximization theory. Mode choice behaviour was examined by considering the gender heterogeneity of the occasional couriers in a multimodal urban transport network. The behavioural dataset was collected in the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine, at the beginning of 2021. The results indicated that women were willing to provide CS service with 8% less remuneration than men. Women were also more likely to make 10% longer detours by car and metro than men, while male couriers were willing to implement 25% longer detours when travelling by bike or walking. Considering the integration of CS detours into the courie",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了可能充当偶尔快递员提供众包配送服务的人们的模式选择行为。鉴于在线杂货服务近年来越来越受欢迎，它已成为众包配送提供商的主要市场。研究采用了行为调查、PTV Visum模拟和基于随机效用最大化理论的离散选择行为建模。通过考虑多模式城市交通网络中偶然快递员的性别差异，研究了模式选择行为。行为数据集是在乌克兰哈尔科夫市于2021年初收集的。结果显示，女性愿意以比男性少8％的薪酬提供众包配送服务。女性也更愿意通过汽车和地铁进行10％的更长绕道，而男性快递员在骑自行车或步行时愿意增加25％的绕道路程。考虑到众包配送绕道对快递人员的影响。",
