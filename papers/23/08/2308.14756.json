    "translated_abstract": "当前的量子计算机受到非稳定的高误差率噪声通道的影响，这削弱了它们的可靠性和可重复性。我们提出了一种基于贝叶斯推断的自适应算法，可以学习和缓解随着通道条件变化的量子噪声。我们的研究强调了需要动态推断关键通道参数来提高程序精度。我们使用狄利克雷分布来建模泊松噪声的随机性。这使得我们能够进行贝叶斯推断，从而可以改善在时变噪声下概率性误差抵消（PEC）的性能。我们的工作展示了表征和缓解量子噪声的时间变化的重要性，这对于开发更准确可靠的量子技术至关重要。我们的结果表明，贝叶斯PEC在使用Hellinger距离从理想分布进行测量时可以比非自适应方法提高4.5倍。",
