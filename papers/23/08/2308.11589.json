    "abstract": "This study focuses on the development of Indonesian Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) using the XLSR-53 pre-trained model, the XLSR stands for cross-lingual speech representations. The use of this XLSR-53 pre-trained model is to significantly reduce the amount of training data in non-English languages required to achieve a competitive Word Error Rate (WER). The total amount of data used in this study is 24 hours, 18 minutes, and 1 second: (1) TITML-IDN 14 hours and 31 minutes; (2) Magic Data 3 hours and 33 minutes; and (3) Common Voice 6 hours, 14 minutes, and 1 second. With a WER of 20%, the model built in this study can compete with similar models using the Common Voice dataset split test. WER can be decreased by around 8% using a language model, resulted in WER from 20% to 12%. Thus, the results of this study have succeeded in perfecting previous research in contributing to the creation of a better Indonesian ASR with a smaller amount of data.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究侧重于利用XLSR-53预训练模型开发印尼语的自动语音识别（ASR）系统。XLSR代表跨语言语音表示。使用XLSR-53预训练模型的目的是显著减少在非英语语言下获得竞争性词错误率（WER）所需的训练数据量。本研究使用共计24小时18分钟1秒的数据，其中包括：（1）14小时31分钟的TITML-IDN数据；（2）3小时33分钟的Magic Data数据；以及（3）6小时14分钟1秒的Common Voice数据。在WER为20%的情况下，本研究构建的模型能够与使用Common Voice数据集分割测试的类似模型竞争。通过使用语言模型，WER可以降低约8%，使其从20%降至12%。因此，本研究的结果成功完善了之前的研究，为创造一个更好的印尼语自动语音识别系统提供了更少的数据支持。",
