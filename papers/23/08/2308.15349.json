    "translated_abstract": "准确地基于数据预测Hamiltonian系统的长期演化需要一个在每个时间步保持适当结构的网络。每个Hamiltonian系统都包含两个基本要素：Poisson括号和Hamiltonian。具有对称性的Hamiltonian系统，其典型例子是Lie-Poisson系统，已被证明能描述从卫星运动到水下车辆、流体、地球物理应用、复杂流体和等离子物理等广泛的物理现象。在这些系统中，Poisson括号来自对称性，而Hamiltonian来自底层物理。我们将系统的对称性视为首要，因此Lie-Poisson括号被准确知晓，而Hamiltonian则被视为来自物理且可能不知晓或近似已知。基于这种方法，我们开发了一个基于变换的网络，能够准确保持Poisson括号和特殊函数。",
