    "translated_abstract": "科学论文可以分为两个主要部分，即元数据和全文。元数据提供了论文的简要概述，而全文包含了对其他研究人员有价值的关键洞察。为了从科学论文中获取元数据和关键洞察，知识获取是一项核心活动。它包括收集、分析和组织嵌入在科学论文中的知识，以便在需要时可以使用和重复使用。鉴于丰富的科学文献，手动知识获取是一项繁琐的任务。因此，通常采用计算机辅助和（半）自动策略。我们在本研究中的目的是：利用与本体学习相关的论文策划开放研究知识图谱（ORKG），并使用ORKG作为计算机辅助工具，组织从研究论文中提取的关键洞察。该方法被用于记录“流行病学监测系统设计”。",
