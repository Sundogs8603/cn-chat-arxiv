    "abstract": "Metaverse enables users to communicate, collaborate and socialize with each other through their digital avatars. Due to the spatio-temporal characteristics, co-located users are served well by performing their software components in a collaborative manner such that a Metaverse service provider (MSP) eliminates redundant data transmission and processing, ultimately reducing the total energy consumption. The energyefficient service provision is crucial for enabling the green and sustainable Metaverse. In this article, we take an augmented reality (AR) application as an example to achieve this goal. Moreover, we study an economic issue on how the users reserve offloading services from the MSP and how the MSP determines an optimal charging price since each user is rational to decide whether to accept the offloading service by taking into account the monetary cost. A single-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game is formulated between the MSP and users while each user optimizes an offloading",

    "translated_abstract": "Metaverse通过数字化的虚拟角色使用户能够相互交流、合作和社交。由于时空特性，通过协同方式执行软件组件可以为共同定位的用户提供良好的服务，从而减少冗余的数据传输和处理，最终减少总能耗。能效的服务提供对于实现绿色和可持续的Metaverse至关重要。本文以增强现实（AR）应用程序为例来实现这个目标。此外，我们研究了一个经济问题，即用户如何预订MSP的卸载服务，以及MSP如何确定最优收费价格，因为每个用户都会根据货币成本来决定是否接受卸载服务。在MSP和用户之间建立了单主导多从属的Stackelberg博弈，而每个用户都在优化卸载服务时同时进行决策。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了绿色Metaverse中的服务预订和定价问题，通过Stackelberg博弈方法解决了MSP和用户之间的经济冲突，实现了能效的服务提供。"
