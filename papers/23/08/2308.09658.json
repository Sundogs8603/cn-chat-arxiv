    "translated_abstract": "使用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成类似代码的计划，用于复杂推理任务（如视觉推理）正在成为一种有前途的趋势。这种被称为LLM-based planning的范式在问题解决的灵活性和可解释性方面具有优势。然而，当前的研究大多限于简单问题的基本情景，这些问题可以直接回答出来，只需要几个推理步骤。对于更具挑战性的多跳视觉推理任务的计划制订还未充分探索。在多跳推理的情况下，准确性和计划搜索复杂性之间的权衡变得显著。目前的算法要么通过采用快速一次性生成来解决效率问题，要么采用复杂的迭代生成方法来提高准确性。但两种方法都无法平衡效率和性能的需求。受到人脑中的双系统认知（快速思考和慢速思考）的启发，我们提出了一种树形混合思维的方法。",
