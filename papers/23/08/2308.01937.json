    "abstract": "We introduce Compartmentalized Diffusion Models (CDM), a method to train different diffusion models (or prompts) on distinct data sources and arbitrarily compose them at inference time. The individual models can be trained in isolation, at different times, and on different distributions and domains and can be later composed to achieve performance comparable to a paragon model trained on all data simultaneously. Furthermore, each model only contains information about the subset of the data it was exposed to during training, enabling several forms of training data protection. In particular, CDMs are the first method to enable both selective forgetting and continual learning for large-scale diffusion models, as well as allowing serving customized models based on the user's access rights. CDMs also allow determining the importance of a subset of the data in generating particular samples.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了分区扩散模型（CDM），一种在不同数据源上训练不同扩散模型（或提示）并在推断时任意组合它们的方法。这些单独的模型可以在孤立状态下、在不同时间、在不同分布和领域上进行训练，并可以后续组合以达到与同时训练所有数据的理想模型相当的性能。此外，每个模型只包含其在训练期间接触到的数据子集的信息，可以实现多种形式的训练数据保护。特别是，CDM是第一种可以实现大规模扩散模型的选择性遗忘和持续学习的方法，并且允许根据用户访问权限提供定制模型。CDM还可以确定生成特定样本的数据子集的重要性。",
