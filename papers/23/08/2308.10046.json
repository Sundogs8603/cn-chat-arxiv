    "abstract": "We present a model of startup acquisitions, which may give rise to inefficient \"talent hoarding.\" We develop a model with two competing firms that can acquire and integrate (or \"acquihire\") a startup operating in an orthogonal market. Such an acquihire improves the competitiveness of the acquiring firm. We show that even absent the classical competition effects, acquihires need not be benign but can be the result of oligopolistic behavior, leading to an inefficient allocation of talent. Further, we show that such talent hoarding may reduce consumer surplus and lead to more job volatility for acquihired employees.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个创业公司收购模型，可能导致低效的 \"人才囤积\"。我们开发了一个有两个竞争公司的模型，这些公司可以收购和整合一个在不同领域运营的创业公司，这种收购改善了收购公司的竞争力。我们表明，即使没有经典的竞争效应，这种收购也可能不是良性的，而是垄断行为的结果，导致人才分配低效。此外，我们还表明，这种人才囤积可能会降低消费者剩余，并导致被收购员工的工作不稳定性增加。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a model of startup acquisitions and highlights the inefficient \"talent hoarding\" that can result from such acquisitions. The study reveals that even in the absence of competition effects, acquisitions can be driven by monopolistic behavior, leading to inefficient talent allocation and negative impacts on consumer surplus and job stability for acquihired employees."
