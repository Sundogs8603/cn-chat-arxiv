    "abstract": "Room layout estimation predicts layouts from a single panorama. It requires datasets with large-scale and diverse room shapes to train the models. However, there are significant imbalances in real-world datasets including the dimensions of layout complexity, camera locations, and variation in scene appearance. These issues considerably influence the model training performance. In this work, we propose the imBalance-Aware Room Layout Estimation (iBARLE) framework to address these issues. iBARLE consists of (1) Appearance Variation Generation (AVG) module, which promotes visual appearance domain generalization, (2) Complex Structure Mix-up (CSMix) module, which enhances generalizability w.r.t. room structure, and (3) a gradient-based layout objective function, which allows more effective accounting for occlusions in complex layouts. All modules are jointly trained and help each other to achieve the best performance. Experiments and ablation studies based on ZInD~\\cite{cruz2021zillow} dat",

    "translated_abstract": "房间布局估计是从单个全景图预测布局。它需要具有大规模和多样化的房间形状的数据集来训练模型。然而，真实世界的数据集中存在显著的不平衡，包括布局复杂度的尺寸、相机位置和场景外观的变化。这些问题显著影响模型的训练性能。在这项工作中，我们提出了平衡感知式房间布局估计（iBARLE）框架来解决这些问题。iBARLE包括（1）外观变化生成（AVG）模块，促进视觉外观领域的泛化，（2）复杂结构混合（CSMix）模块，提高对房间结构的泛化能力，和（3）基于梯度的布局目标函数，更有效地考虑复杂布局中的遮挡。所有模块都是联合训练的，彼此帮助以实现最佳性能。基于ZInD~\\cite{cruz2021zillow}数据集的实验和消融研究验证了我们的方法的有效性。",
