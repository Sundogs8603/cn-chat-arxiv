    "abstract": "Introduction: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained significant popularity in various applications due to their rich information content.

Nevertheless, the availability of EOG recordings is not always feasible, particularly in pre-recorded datasets. Objective: In this paper, we present a novel methodology that combines a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural network with ICA to address the challenge of EOG artifact removal from contaminated EEG signals. Approach: Our approach aims to accomplish two primary objectives: 1) estimate the horizontal and vertical EOG signals from the contaminated EEG data, and 2) employ ICA ",

    "translated_abstract": "引言：由于其丰富的信息内容，脑电图(EEG)信号在各种应用中获得了显著的流行度。然而，这些信号容易受到来自各种伪迹源的污染，尤其是由眼睛运动引起的眼电图(EOG)伪迹。解决EOG伪迹的最有效方法是同时记录EOG信号和EEG信号，并使用盲源分离技术，如独立成分分析(ICA)。然而，在预先录制的数据集中，EOG记录的可用性并不总是可行的。目标：在本文中，我们提出了一种新的方法，该方法将基于长短期记忆(LSTM)的神经网络与ICA相结合，以解决从受污染的EEG信号中去除EOG伪迹的挑战。方法：我们的方法旨在实现两个主要目标：1) 从受污染的EEG数据中估计水平和垂直的EOG信号；2) 使用ICA对估计的EOG信号进行盲源分离。",
