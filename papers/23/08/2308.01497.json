    "translated_abstract": "最近在大型语言模型（LLMs）性能方面的进展引发了关于这种通用人工智能（AI）是否能够在足够的训练下展现出高水平人类能力的争论。尽管LLMs在涉及自然语言处理和推理的各种任务中表现出色，但对它们的能力是否延伸到更具创造力的人类能力存在严重分歧。其中一个核心问题是解释新颖隐喻的能力。由于用于训练LLMs的庞大且非策划的文本语料库，设计测试的一个严重障碍就是需要找到新颖但高质量的隐喻，这些隐喻不太可能出现在训练数据中。在这里，我们评估了GPT-4，一种最先进的大型语言模型，对来自塞尔维亚诗歌并翻译为英语的新颖文学隐喻的自然语言解释能力。",
