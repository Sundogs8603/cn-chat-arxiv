    "translated_abstract": "在推荐系统中，使用多用户表示（MUR）来建模用户行为而不是单个用户表示（SUR）已经证明可以提高个性化效果。然而，MUR的性能提升可能对物品和/或用户兴趣分布的偏斜性敏感。当数据分布高度偏斜时，学习多个表示的收益减小，因为模型在热门物品/兴趣上占主导地位，导致对于长尾物品的推荐效果差。因此，MUR方法对于数据稀疏性的鲁棒性是实现良好推荐效果的关键。然而，关于MUR和数据不平衡的研究在过去很大程度上是独立进行的。在本文中，我们更深入地研究了从不平衡数据分布中推断出的MUR的缺点。我们提出了几点贡献：（1）使用合成数据集，我们展示了MUR相对于数据不平衡的敏感性，（2）为了改进对于长尾物品的MUR，我们提出了一种密度加权的方法。",
