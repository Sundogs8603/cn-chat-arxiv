    "abstract": "Many hotels target guest acquisition efforts to specific markets in order to best anticipate individual preferences and needs of their guests. Likewise, such strategic positioning is a prerequisite for efficient marketing budget allocation. Official statistics report on the number of visitors from different countries, but no fine-grained information on the guest composition of individual businesses exists. There is, however, growing interest in such data from competitors, suppliers, researchers and the general public. We demonstrate how machine learning can be leveraged to extract references to guest nationalities from unstructured text reviews in order to dynamically assess and monitor the dynamics of guest composition of individual businesses. In particular, we show that a rather simple architecture of pre-trained embeddings and stacked LSTM layers provides a better performance-runtime tradeoff than more complex state-of-the-art language models.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多酒店通过针对特定市场的客户获取努力，以最好地预测客人的个人偏好和需求。同样，这种战略定位是有效的营销预算分配的先决条件。官方统计数据报告了来自不同国家的游客数量，但没有关于个别企业客人构成的细粒度信息。然而，竞争对手、供应商、研究人员和普通公众对这些数据的兴趣越来越大。我们展示了如何利用机器学习从非结构化文本评论中提取客人国籍的引用，以动态评估和监测个别企业客人构成的动态变化。特别是，我们证明了预训练嵌入和堆叠的LSTM层的相当简单的架构提供了比复杂的最先进语言模型更好的性能和运行时间的权衡。",
