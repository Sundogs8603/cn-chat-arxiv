    "abstract": "The core premise of permissionless blockchains is their reliable and secure operation without the need to trust any individual agent. At the heart of blockchain consensus mechanisms is an explicit cost (whether work or stake) for participation in the network and the opportunity to add blocks to the blockchain. A key rationale for that cost is to make attacks on the network, which could be theoretically carried out if a majority of nodes were controlled by a single entity, too expensive to be worthwhile. We demonstrate that a majority attacker can successfully attack with a {\\em negative cost}, which shows that the protocol mechanisms are insufficient to create a secure network, and emphasizes the importance of socially driven mechanisms external to the protocol. At the same time, negative cost enables a new type of majority attack that is more likely to elude external scrutiny.",

    "translated_abstract": "无许可区块链的核心前提是在不需要信任任何个体代理的情况下进行可靠且安全的运作。区块链共识机制的核心是对网络参与和添加区块的明确成本（无论是工作还是持股）。这个成本的关键理论是为了使得控制网络的多数节点的单一实体进行攻击变得过于昂贵而不值得。我们证明了多数攻击者可以成功地进行一种“零成本”的攻击，这表明协议机制不足以创建一个安全的网络，并强调了外部协议所需的社会驱动机制的重要性。同时，零成本也使得一种新型多数攻击更容易逃避外部的审查。",
