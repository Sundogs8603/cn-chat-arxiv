    "translated_abstract": "由冠状动脉内斑块的堆积引起的功能性冠状动脉疾病（CAD）可能导致冠状动脉管腔狭窄，即冠状动脉狭窄，从而显著阻碍血液流向心肌。目前用于确定功能性狭窄存在的参考是侵入性的分数流预测（FFR）测量。为了避免侵入性测量，非侵入性的从冠状CT血管造影（CCTA）预测FFR的方法逐渐出现。为此，特征为快速推理的机器学习方法日趋发展。然而，这些方法仅预测每个冠状动脉的单个FFR值，即它们不提供关于狭窄位置或治疗策略的信息。我们提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，从CCTA扫描中预测沿冠状动脉的FFR。该研究包括110名患者进行的112条冠状动脉侵入性FFR回拉测量的CCTA图像。",
