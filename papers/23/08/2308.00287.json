    "translated_abstract": "无监督领域自适应（UDA）方法可以在没有标签的情况下将模型转移到目标领域。然而，这些方法需要一个标记的目标验证集用于超参数调优和模型选择。本文旨在寻找一种能够评估转移模型质量的评估度量，而无需访问目标验证标签。我们首先基于模型预测的互信息的度量。通过实证分析，我们发现了这个度量的三个普遍问题：1）它没有考虑源结构；2）它容易受到攻击；3）它无法检测到由于源和目标特征过度对齐导致的负迁移。为了解决前两个问题，我们将源准确率纳入度量中，并使用一种在训练过程中保持独立的新的多层感知器（MLP）分类器，从而显著改进了结果。为了解决最后一个问题，我们将这个增强的度量与数据增强相结合，得到一个n",
