    "translated_abstract": "超声图像的复杂场景中，相邻组织（即背景）与病变区域（即前景）具有相似的强度甚至包含更丰富的纹理模式，这给准确的病变分割带来了独特的挑战。本文提出了一种被称为DC-Net的分解耦合网络来应对这一挑战，以分离-融合（前景-背景）显著性图的方式进行处理。DC-Net由分解和耦合子网络组成，前者将原始图像初步分解为前景和背景显著性图，然后在显著性先验融合的辅助下，由后者进行准确的分割。耦合子网络涉及三个融合策略方面：1）区域特征聚合（通过编码器中的可微分上下文池化算子）以自适应地保留具有更大感受野的局部上下文细节进行尺寸降低；2）关系感知表示融合。",
