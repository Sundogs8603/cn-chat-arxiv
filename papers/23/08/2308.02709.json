    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在存在未观测混淆变量和离散值观测变量的因果图上计算因果查询的界限的问题，其中不满足可辨识性。现有的非参数方法用于计算这些界限的线性规划（LP）公式由于线性规划的大小随着因果图中的边的数量呈指数级增长而很快变得不可解。我们展示了这个LP公式可以被显著修剪，使我们能够计算较大因果推断问题的界限，相比现有技术，这个修剪过程允许我们以闭合形式计算一类特殊问题的界限，包括多个混淆处理影响结果的广为研究的问题族。我们将修剪方法扩展到分数线性规划（fractional LP），这些规划公式用于计算包含有关个体的附加观测的因果查询的界限。我们证明了我们的方法提供了显著的运行时间",
