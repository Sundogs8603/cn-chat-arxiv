    "translated_abstract": "在计算机视觉中，准确追踪手部和手指运动面临着重大挑战。潜在的应用范围涵盖了多个领域，包括人机交互、虚拟现实、工业和医学。虽然手势识别已经取得了显著的准确性，但是量化细微的运动仍然是一个障碍，特别是在临床应用中，手功能障碍和康复训练结果的评估需要精确测量。出现了几种基于深度学习的新颖且轻量级的框架来解决这个问题；然而，它们在精确可靠地测量手指运动方面的性能需要对其进行与已建立的黄金标准系统的验证。本文旨在验证由Google MediaPipe Hand（GMH）实现的手部追踪框架以及一种创新的增强版本GMH-D，在RGB-Depth相机的深度估计的基础上实现更准确的3D运动追踪。",
