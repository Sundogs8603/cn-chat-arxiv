    "abstract": "Authoring data-driven articles is a complex process requiring authors to not only analyze data for insights but also craft a cohesive narrative that effectively communicates the insights. Text generation capabilities of contemporary large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to assist the authoring of data-driven articles and expedite the writing process. In this work, we investigate the feasibility and perceived value of leveraging LLMs to support authors of data-driven articles. We designed a prototype system, DataTales, that leverages a LLM to generate textual narratives accompanying a given chart. Using DataTales as a design probe, we conducted a qualitative study with 11 professionals to evaluate the concept, from which we distilled affordances and opportunities to further integrate LLMs as valuable data-driven article authoring assistants.",

    "translated_abstract": "撰写数据驱动文章是一个复杂的过程，需要作者不仅分析数据以获取见解，还要构建一个连贯的叙述来有效传达这些见解。当代大型语言模型(LLMs)的文本生成能力为辅助数据驱动文章的撰写提供了机会，加快了写作过程。本研究旨在调查利用LLMs来辅助作者撰写数据驱动文章的可行性和感知价值。我们设计了一个原型系统DataTales，利用LLM来生成给定图表的文本叙述。通过使用DataTales作为设计探针，我们对11名专业人员进行了定性研究，以评估该概念，并从中提炼出进一步整合LLMs作为有价值的数据驱动文章撰写助手的可行性和机会。",
