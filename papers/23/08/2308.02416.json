    "translated_abstract": "临床决策支持系统（CDSSs）已被广泛应用于支持心电图（ECGs）中心血管科医生检测和分类心律失常时所做的决策。然而，由于心律失常长度的变化，形成一个针对心律失常分类任务的CDSS是具有挑战性的。虽然心律失常的发作时间是变化的，但之前开发的方法没有考虑到这些条件。因此，我们提出了一个框架，包括（i）本地时间信息提取，（ii）全局模式提取，和（iii）带有注意力的本地-全局信息融合，以实现对有限输入长度的心律失常检测和分类。我们的方法通过检测心律失常起始和结束时间作为一个事件，以及基于MIT-BIH心律失常数据库（MITDB）和MIT-BIH房颤数据库（AFDB）的心律失常持续时间来评估10类和4类表现。结果在统计上优于现有方法。",

By extracting local temporal information and global patterns, and integrating them with attention, the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing methods for arrhythmia classification."
