    "translated_abstract": "细粒度的、跨度级别的人工评估已经成为评价文本生成任务的可靠和稳健的方法，如摘要、简化、机器翻译和新闻生成，并且得到的标注对训练自动评估指标和改善语言模型非常有用。然而，现有的为这些评估框架实施的标注工具缺乏适应不同领域或语言的能力，或者根据用户需求修改标注设置。缺乏统一的标注数据格式阻碍了多任务学习的研究。在本文中，我们介绍了Thresh，一个统一的、可定制的和可部署的细粒度评估平台。只需创建一个YAML配置文件，用户可以在几分钟内构建和测试任何框架的注释界面 - 所有这些都在一个web浏览器窗口中。为了促进协作和共享，Thresh提供了一个社区中心，这个中心托管了一系列细粒度评估数据集。",
