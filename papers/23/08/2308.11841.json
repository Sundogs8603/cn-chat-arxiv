    "abstract": "Evaluation is a systematic approach to assessing how well a system achieves its intended purpose. Federated learning (FL) is a novel paradigm for privacy-preserving machine learning that allows multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing sensitive data. However, evaluating FL is challenging due to its interdisciplinary nature and diverse goals, such as utility, efficiency, and security. In this survey, we first review the major evaluation goals adopted in the existing studies and then explore the evaluation metrics used for each goal. We also introduce FedEval, an open-source platform that provides a standardized and comprehensive evaluation framework for FL algorithms in terms of their utility, efficiency, and security. Finally, we discuss several challenges and future research directions for FL evaluation.",

    "translated_abstract": "评估是一种系统评估一个系统如何实现其预期目标的方法。联邦学习（FL）是一种保护隐私的机器学习新范式，允许多个参与方在不共享敏感数据的情况下共同训练模型。然而，评估FL具有跨学科性和多样化的目标（如效用、效率和安全性），因此具有挑战性。在本调查中，我们首先回顾了现有研究中采用的主要评估目标，然后探讨了每个目标使用的评估指标。我们还介绍了FedEval，一个开源平台，它提供了一个标准化和全面的联邦学习算法评估框架，涵盖了其效用、效率和安全性。最后，我们讨论了联邦学习评估面临的几个挑战和未来研究方向。",
