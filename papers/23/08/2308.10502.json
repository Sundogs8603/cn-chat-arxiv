    "translated_abstract": "自2008年比特币电子现金系统提出以来，比特币已经从根本上改变了过去十年的经济系统。自2022年以来，如GPT等大型语言模型在许多现实生活任务中表现出超越人类的能力。然而，这些大型语言模型存在一些实际问题。例如，模型是集中化的，由特定单位控制。一个弱点是，如果该单位决定关闭模型，则无法再使用。第二个弱点是缺乏对这个模型背后的保证差异，因为某些不诚实的单位可能设计自己的模型并为其提供不健康的训练数据。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个纯理论设计的去中心化语言模型，其运作方式类似于比特币现金系统。然而，实施这样的系统可能会遇到各种实际困难。此外，这个新系统在经济学上不太可能比标准的比特币系统表现更好。因此，去中心化大型语言模型的动机是什么呢？",

However, implementing this system may face practical challenges, and it may not perform as well as the standard Bitcoin system in economics."
