    "abstract": "Semi-supervised crowd counting is an important yet challenging task. A popular approach is to iteratively generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data and add them to the training set. The key is to use uncertainty to select reliable pseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel method to calibrate model uncertainty for crowd counting. Our method takes a supervised uncertainty estimation strategy to train the model through a surrogate function. This ensures the uncertainty is well controlled throughout the training. We propose a matching-based patch-wise surrogate function to better approximate uncertainty for crowd counting tasks. The proposed method pays a sufficient amount of attention to details, while maintaining a proper granularity. Altogether our method is able to generate reliable uncertainty estimation, high quality pseudolabels, and achieve state-of-the-art performance in semisupervised crowd counting.",

    "translated_abstract": "半监督人群计数是一项重要而具有挑战性的任务。一种常用的方法是通过迭代生成伪标签并将其添加到训练集中来进行学习。关键是使用不确定性来选择可靠的伪标签。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法来校准人群计数模型的不确定性。我们的方法采用有监督的不确定性估计策略通过一个替代函数来训练模型。这确保了在整个训练过程中不确定性得到良好的控制。我们提出了一种基于匹配的以补丁为单位的替代函数，以更好地近似人群计数任务的不确定性。所提出的方法注重细节，同时保持适当的细粒度。总的来说，我们的方法能够生成可靠的不确定性估计、高质量的伪标签，并在半监督人群计数中取得最先进的性能。",
