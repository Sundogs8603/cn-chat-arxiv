    "abstract": "Real-world time series data that commonly reflect sequential human behavior are often uniquely irregularly sampled and sparse, with highly nonuniform sampling over time and entities. Yet, commonly-used pretraining and augmentation methods for time series are not specifically designed for such scenarios. In this paper, we present PAITS (Pretraining and Augmentation for Irregularly-sampled Time Series), a framework for identifying suitable pretraining strategies for sparse and irregularly sampled time series datasets. PAITS leverages a novel combination of NLP-inspired pretraining tasks and augmentations, and a random search to identify an effective strategy for a given dataset. We demonstrate that different datasets benefit from different pretraining choices. Compared with prior methods, our approach is better able to consistently improve pretraining across multiple datasets and domains.

    "translated_abstract": "现实世界中常见的时间序列数据通常反映了顺序人类行为，而这些数据经常是独特的不规则采样和稀疏的，时间和实体上的采样非常不均匀。然而，常用的时间序列预训练和增强方法并不具备针对这种情况的专门设计。本文提出了PAITS（不规则采样时间序列的预训练和增强）框架，用于识别适合稀疏和不规则采样时间序列数据集的预训练策略。PAITS利用一种新颖的结合了NLP启发式预训练任务和增强技术的方法，以及随机搜索来为给定数据集找到有效的策略。我们证明不同的数据集受益于不同的预训练选择。与之前的方法相比，我们的方法能够更好地持续改进多个数据集和领域的预训练效果。我们的代码可在 \\url{https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/irregul} 找到。",
