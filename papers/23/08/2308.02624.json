    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）是否正在破坏工作岗位并导致失业？尽管有很多企图量化AI对职业的暴露程度的努力，但不一致的验证模糊了每种方法的相对利益。缺乏包括失业数据在内的细分劳动结果数据进一步加剧了这个问题。在这里，我们使用每个美国州的失业保险办公室从2010年到2020年涵盖的新的职业层面失业数据评估哪些AI暴露模型能够预测工作分离和失业风险。尽管这些AI暴露分数已被政府和行业使用，但我们发现单个AI暴露模型无法预测失业率、失业风险或工作分离率。然而，这些模型的集成展现出巨大的预测能力，表明竞争模型可能捕捉到了AI暴露的不同方面，共同解释了AI在不同职业、地区和时间下各异的影响。我们的研究揭示了AI对就业的影响具有多样性。",

This study uses new occupation-level unemployment data to assess the predictive power of AI exposure models. It finds that individual models cannot accurately predict unemployment rates and risk, but an ensemble of models shows strong predictive ability, suggesting that different models can explain the diverse impact of AI across occupations, regions, and time."
