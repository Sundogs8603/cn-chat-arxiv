    "translated_abstract": "物理信息神经网络（PINNs）已被证明在解决各种实验角度中的偏微分方程（PDEs）方面非常高效。一些最近的研究还提出了针对表面，包括球面上的PDEs的PINN算法。然而，对于PINNs的数值性能，尤其是在表面或流形上的PINNs，仍然缺乏理论理解。本文中，我们对用于在球面上解决PDEs的物理信息卷积神经网络（PICNN）进行了严格分析。通过使用和改进深度卷积神经网络和球谐分析的最新逼近结果，我们证明了该逼近误差与Sobolev范数的上界。随后，我们将这一结果与创新的局部复杂度分析相结合，建立了PICNN的快速收敛速率。我们的理论结果也得到了实验的验证和补充。鉴于这些发现，",
