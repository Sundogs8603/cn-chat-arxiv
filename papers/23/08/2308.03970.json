    "translated_abstract": "许多统计推断场景，包括贝叶斯网络、马尔可夫过程和隐马尔可夫模型，可以通过将基础的有向无环图（DAG）划分成集群来支持。然而，在统计推断中，最优划分是具有挑战性的，因为要优化的成本取决于集群内的节点以及通过父节点和/或子节点连接的集群之间的映射，我们将其称为依赖集群。我们提出了一种名为DCMAP的新算法，用于具有依赖集群的最优集群映射。在基于DAG和集群映射的任意定义的正成本函数的基础上，我们证明DCMAP收敛于找到所有最优集群，并在途中返回接近最优解。通过实验证明，该算法对使用计算成本函数的一个海草复杂系统的DBN模型具有时间效率性。对于一个25个和50个节点的DBN，搜索空间大小分别为$9.91\\times 10^9$和$1.5$",
