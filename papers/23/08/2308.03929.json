We compiled two datasets: one from biomedical literature using a \"human disease and symptoms\" query, and another generated by ChatGPT, simulating articles. With these datasets (PubMed and ChatGPT), we curated 10 sets of 250 abstracts each, selected randomly with a specific seed. Our method focuses on utilizing disease ontology (DOID) and symptom ontology (SYMP) to build knowledge graphs, robust mathematical models that facilitate unbiased comparisons. By employing our fact-checking algorithms and network centrality metrics, we conducted GPT disease-symptoms link analysis to quantify the accuracy of factual knowledge amid noise, hypotheses, and significant findings.

    "translated_abstract": "方法：通过创新的方法，我们从真实的医学文献和人工智能生成的内容构建了基于本体的知识图谱。我们的目标是区分事实信息和未经验证的数据。我们收集了两个数据集：一个是使用“人类疾病和症状”查询从生物医学文献中编译的，另一个是由ChatGPT生成的模拟文章。利用这些数据集（PubMed和ChatGPT），我们随机选择了10组每组250个摘要，并使用特定的种子。我们的方法主要是利用疾病本体（DOID）和症状本体（SYMP）构建知识图谱，这是一种强大的数学模型，可以进行无偏差的比较。通过使用我们的事实核查算法和网络中心度指标，我们进行了GPT疾病-症状链接分析，以量化在噪声、假设和重要发现中的事实知识的准确性。结果：通过比较不同ChatGPT知识图谱及其PubMed计数获得的结果，我们发现...",
