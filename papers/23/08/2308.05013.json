Therefore, user-centric group discovery task, i.e., recommending groups to users can help both users' online experiences and platforms' long-term developments. Existing recommender methods can not deal with this task as modeling user-group participation into a bipartite graph overlooks their item-side interests. Although there exist a few works attempting to address this task, they still fall short in fully preserving the social context and ensuring effective interest representation learning.  In this paper, we focus on exploring the intents that motivate users to participate in groups, which can be categorized into different types, like the social-intent and the personal interest-intent. The former refers to users joining a group affected by their social links, while the latter relates to users joining groups with like-minded people for self-enjoyment. To comprehend",

    "translated_abstract": "在线群组越来越普遍，为用户提供了分享经验和探索兴趣的空间。因此，用户中心的群组发现任务，即向用户推荐群组，可以帮助用户的在线体验和平台的长期发展。现有的推荐方法不能处理这个任务，因为将用户-群组参与建模成一个二部图忽视了他们的项目侧兴趣。虽然有一些作品试图解决这个任务，但仍然不足以完全保留社交上下文并确保有效的兴趣表示学习。本文重点研究激励用户参与群组的意图，这些意图可以分为不同类型，如社交意图和个人兴趣意图。前者指的是用户加入群组受到他们的社交关系的影响，而后者指的是用户与志同道合的人一起加入群组进行自我享受。为了理解这些意图",
