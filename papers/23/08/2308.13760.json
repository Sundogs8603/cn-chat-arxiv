    "translated_abstract": "将外部个性化上下文信息整合到以文档为基础的对话系统中具有重要的商业价值，但这方面的研究还不够深入。受个性化上下文感知文档对话系统的概念启发，我们引入了上下文感知的段落检索任务，并构建了一个专门为此目的策划的数据集。我们描述了多个基准系统来解决这个任务，并提出了一种新颖的方法，即个性化上下文感知搜索(Personalized Context-Aware Search，PCAS)，它在段落检索过程中有效地利用上下文信息。在多个流行的稠密检索系统上进行的实验评估表明，我们的方法不仅在检索最相关的段落方面优于基准系统，而且在确定所有可用上下文中的相关上下文方面也表现出色。我们预计我们的贡献将成为激励未来研究的催化剂。",
