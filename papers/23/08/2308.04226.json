    "abstract": "When searching for products, the opinions of others play an important role in making informed decisions. Subjective experiences about a product can be a valuable source of information. This is also true in sales conversations, where a customer and a sales assistant exchange facts and opinions about products. However, training an AI for such conversations is complicated by the fact that language models do not possess authentic opinions for their lack of real-world experience. We address this problem by leveraging product reviews as a rich source of product opinions to ground conversational AI in true subjective narratives. With OpinionConv, we develop the first conversational AI for simulating sales conversations. To validate the generated conversations, we conduct several user studies showing that the generated opinions are perceived as realistic. Our assessors also confirm the importance of opinions as an informative basis for decision-making.",

    "translated_abstract": "在搜索产品时，他人的观点在做出明智决策方面起着重要作用。对产品的主观体验可以是有价值的信息来源。这在销售对话中也是如此，在这种对话中，客户和销售助手交换有关产品的事实和观点。然而，训练一个用于此类对话的AI是复杂的，因为语言模型由于缺乏真实世界的经验没有真实的观点。我们通过利用产品评论作为产品观点的丰富来源来解决这个问题，以真实主观叙述支持对话式AI。通过OpinionConv，我们开发了第一个模拟销售对话的对话式AI。为了验证生成的对话，我们进行了多个用户研究，结果显示生成的观点被认为是真实的。我们的评估员也确认了观点对于决策的信息基础的重要性。",
