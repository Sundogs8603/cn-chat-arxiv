    "abstract": "We take inspiration from statistical physics to develop a novel conceptual framework for the analysis of financial markets. We model the order book dynamics as a motion of particles and define the momentum measure of the system as a way to summarise and assess the state of the market. Our approach proves useful in capturing salient financial market phenomena: in particular, it helps detect the market manipulation activities called spoofing and layering. We apply our method to identify pathological order book behaviours during the flash crash of the LUNA cryptocurrency, uncovering widespread instances of spoofing and layering in the market. Furthermore, we establish that our technique outperforms the conventional Z-score-based anomaly detection method in identifying market manipulations across both LUNA and Bitcoin cryptocurrency markets.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们受到统计物理的启发，开发了一个用于分析金融市场的新概念框架。我们将订单簿动态建模为粒子的运动，并将系统的动量度量定义为总结和评估市场状态的一种方式。我们的方法在捕捉显著的金融市场现象方面很有用：特别是它有助于检测被称为“虚假订单”和“分层订单”的市场操纵活动。我们应用我们的方法来识别LUNA加密货币的闪崩期间的病态订单簿行为，揭示了市场中广泛存在的伪造订单和分层订单。此外，我们还证实了我们的技术在识别LUNA和Bitcoin加密货币市场的市场操纵方面优于常规的基于Z分数的异常检测方法。",
    "tldr": "该论文通过运用统计物理工具对金融市场进行分析，并提出了一种新的概念框架。研究者们用粒子运动模型表示订单簿动态，并定义了系统的动量度量用于概括和评估市场状况。此方法在捕捉市场操纵活动中具有重要意义，并在识别和解释LUNA和Bitcoin市场中的异常表现方面胜过常规方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a novel conceptual framework inspired by statistical physics to analyze financial markets. By modeling order book dynamics as particle motion and using a momentum measure to summarize and evaluate market state, the researchers are able to effectively detect and explain market manipulation activities. Their method outperforms conventional approaches in identifying and interpreting abnormal behaviors in both the LUNA and Bitcoin markets."
