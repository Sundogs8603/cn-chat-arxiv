    "abstract": "Automated Feature Engineering (AutoFE) has become an important task for any machine learning project, as it can help improve model performance and gain more information for statistical analysis. However, most current approaches for AutoFE rely on manual feature creation or use methods that can generate a large number of features, which can be computationally intensive and lead to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose a novel convolutional method called FeatGeNN that extracts and creates new features using correlation as a pooling function. Unlike traditional pooling functions like max-pooling, correlation-based pooling considers the linear relationship between the features in the data matrix, making it more suitable for tabular data. We evaluate our method on various benchmark datasets and demonstrate that FeatGeNN outperforms existing AutoFE approaches regarding model performance. Our results suggest that correlation-based pooling can be a promising alternative to max-p",

    "translated_abstract": "自动特征工程（AutoFE）已成为任何机器学习项目中重要的任务，因为它可以帮助提高模型性能并为统计分析提供更多信息。然而，目前大多数自动特征工程方法要么依靠手动特征创建，要么使用可能生成大量特征的方法，这会耗费大量计算资源并导致过拟合。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的卷积方法，称为FeatGeNN，它使用相关性作为汇集函数来提取和创建新特征。与传统的最大汇集（max-pooling）等汇集函数不同，基于相关性的汇集考虑了数据矩阵中特征之间的线性关系，使之更适用于表格数据。我们在多个基准数据集上评估了我们的方法，并证明了FeatGeNN在模型性能方面优于现有的自动特征工程方法。我们的结果表明，基于相关性的汇集可以成为最大汇集的一种有前途的替代方法。",
