    "translated_abstract": "语音转换旨在改变一个人的声音，使其听起来与另一个人的声音相似，同时保留语言内容。现有的方法在内容可理解性和说话人相似性之间存在困境；即具有更高可理解性的方法通常具有较低的说话人相似性，而具有更高说话人相似性的方法通常需要大量目标说话人的语音数据来实现高可理解性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新方法“音素幻觉器”，它兼具两者的优势。音素幻觉器是一种一次性语音转换模型；它采用一种新颖的模型，仅基于较短的目标说话人语音（例如3秒）生成多样化和高保真度的目标说话人音素。然后利用生成的音素进行基于邻居的语音转换。我们的模型是一种无需文本注释的任意到任意的语音转换模型，支持转换到任何未知说话人。",
