In this paper, we analyze different strategies to create static and contextual word embedding models, i.e., Word2Vec and ELMo, on real-world English and Romanian datasets. To test our pipeline and determine the performance of our models, we first evaluate both word embedding models on an English dataset (SEMEVAL-CCOHA). Afterward, we focus our experiments on a Romanian dataset, and we underline different aspects of semantic changes in this low-resource language, such as meaning acquisition and loss. The experimental results show that, depending on the corpus, the most important factors to consider are the choice of model and the distance to calculate a score for detecting semantic change.",
