    "abstract": "The field of women's endocrinology has trailed behind data-driven medical solutions, largely due to concerns over the privacy of patient data. Valuable datapoints about hormone levels or menstrual cycling could expose patients who suffer from comorbidities or terminate a pregnancy, violating their privacy. We explore the application of Federated Learning (FL) to predict the optimal drug for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a serious hormonal disorder impacting millions of women worldwide, yet it's poorly understood and its research is stunted by a lack of patient data. We demonstrate that a variety of FL approaches succeed on a synthetic PCOS patient dataset. Our proposed FL models are a tool to access massive quantities of diverse data and identify the most effective treatment option while providing PCOS patients with privacy guarantees.",

    "translated_abstract": "妇科内分泌学领域在数据驱动的医疗解决方案方面落后，主要是因为对患者数据隐私的担忧。有关荷尔蒙水平或月经周期的有价值的数据点可能会暴露出患有合并症或终止妊娠的患者，侵犯其隐私。我们探讨了在预测多囊卵巢综合征（PCOS）患者的最佳药物方面应用联邦学习（FL）的方法。PCOS是一种影响全球数百万女性的严重激素失调疾病，但其研究受限于患者数据的缺乏。我们展示了各种联邦学习方法在合成的PCOS患者数据集上的成功应用。我们提出的联邦学习模型是一种访问大量多样数据并识别最有效治疗选项的工具，同时提供PCOS患者的隐私保证。",
