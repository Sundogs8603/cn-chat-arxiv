    "translated_abstract": "测量LLM生成的响应质量是一项具有挑战性的任务，特别是在评估响应是否与人类偏好一致时。一种新颖的方法是使用LLM本身进行评估，并通过多个独立评估来稳定结果，类似于单层窄LLM网络。该网络由固定数量的神经元组成，每个神经元都是相同的LLM。在本文中，我们借鉴了关于深度神经网络的广泛研究来探讨更深入和更广泛的网络是否可以导致更公平的评估。具体而言，受到神经网络中不同神经元负责检测不同概念的观察启发，我们首先为每个评估样本适应性地生成尽可能多的神经元角色。每个角度对应于第一层中特定LLM神经元的角色。在随后的层中，我们遵循深度网络中较高层负责相关性解谜的概念。",
