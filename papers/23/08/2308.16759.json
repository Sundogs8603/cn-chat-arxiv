    "translated_abstract": "无线电地图的构建需要大量带有位置标签的无线电测量数据，这给部署成本带来了很高的压力。本文提出了一种基于区域的无线电地图构建方法，它利用接收信号强度（RSS）测量数据而无需位置标签。构建过程基于从一个设备上盲目收集到的RSS测量数据，该设备在室内区域中的各个区域中恰好访问一次，但没有记录脚印和时间戳。主要挑战是将RSS数据聚类，并将聚类与物理区域进行匹配。由于多径和噪声的存在，传统的聚类算法无法有效处理RSS数据，因为RSS数据自然而然地呈现为非聚类的形式。本文构建了一个带有顺序先验的信号子空间模型用于处理RSS数据，并开发了一种综合分割和聚类算法，在特殊情况下证明能够找到全局最优解。此外，使用基于图的算法将聚类数据与物理区域进行匹配。",
