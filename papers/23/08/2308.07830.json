    "abstract": "In B2B markets, value-based pricing and selling has become an important alternative to discounting. This study outlines a modeling method that uses customer data (product offers made to each current or potential customer, features, discounts, and customer purchase decisions) to estimate a mixed logit choice model. The model is estimated via hierarchical Bayes and machine learning, delivering customer-level parameter estimates. Customer-level estimates are input into a nonlinear programming next-offer maximization problem to select optimal features and discount level for customer segments, where segments are based on loyalty and discount elasticity. The mixed logit model is integrated with economic theory (the random utility model), and it predicts both customer perceived value for and response to alternative future sales offers. The methodology can be implemented to support value-based pricing and selling efforts.  Contributions to the literature include: (a) the use of customer-level ",

    "translated_abstract": "在B2B市场中，基于价值的定价和销售已成为对折扣的重要替代方式。本研究概述了一种建模方法，利用客户数据（向每个当前或潜在客户提供的产品报价、特征、折扣和客户购买决策）来估计混合逻辑选择模型。该模型通过分层贝叶斯和机器学习进行估计，提供了客户级别的参数估计。客户级别的估计结果输入到非线性规划的下一步最优特征和折扣选择问题中，以选择针对客户细分进行优化的特征和折扣水平，而客户细分是基于忠诚度和折扣弹性。混合逻辑模型与经济理论（随机效用模型）相结合，可以预测客户对未来销售报价的感知价值和反应。该方法可以应用于支持基于价值的定价和销售工作。对文献的贡献包括：（a）使用客户级别的数据",
