    "translated_abstract": "弥合神经表示与符号表示之间的巨大差距可能使符号思维从本质上融入神经网络。受人类如何逐渐从通过知觉和环境交互学习到的原型符号构建复杂的符号表示的启发，我们提出了一种神经-符号过渡字典学习（TDL）框架，该框架使用EM算法学习数据的过渡表示，将输入的高维视觉部分信息压缩到一组张量作为神经变量，并自监督地发现隐含的谓词结构。我们通过将输入分解视为合作博弈来实现框架，使用扩散模型学习谓词，并通过RL基于扩散模型的马尔可夫性质进一步调整学习到的原型，以融入主观因素。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a Neural-Symbolic Transitional Dictionary Learning (TDL) framework that combines neural networks and symbolic thinking. By learning transitional representation and discovering implicit predicate structure in a self-supervised way, as well as adjusting learned prototypes through game theory and reinforcement learning, the framework enables compression of high-dimensional information and learning of symbolic representation."
