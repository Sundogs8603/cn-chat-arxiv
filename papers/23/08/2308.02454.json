    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在各种应用中展现了巨大的潜力；然而，由于对数据隐私的担忧，它在需要保护隐私的领域的应用受到了限制。Federated Machine Learning（FedML）是解决这个问题的一种有希望的解决方案，它是一种面向数据的模型方法，更加重视数据隐私。通过使机器学习算法直接应用于分布式数据源而不共享原始数据，FedML提供了增强隐私保护，适用于需要保护隐私的环境。尽管在理论上具有显著优势，FedML在实践中并没有得到广泛应用。本研究旨在探索应用FedML的当前状态，并确定阻碍其实际应用的挑战。通过全面系统的文献回顾，我们评估了74篇相关论文，分析了FedML在实际应用中的可行性。我们的分析关注FedML实现的特征和新兴趋势，以及驱动力和应用方面的动机。",
