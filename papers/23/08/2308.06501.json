    "abstract": "Hot news is one of the most popular topics in daily conversations. However, news grounded conversation has long been stymied by the lack of well-designed task definition and scarce data. In this paper, we propose a novel task, Proactive News Grounded Conversation, in which a dialogue system can proactively lead the conversation based on some key topics of the news. In addition, both information-seeking and chit-chat scenarios are included realistically, where the user may ask a series of questions about the news details or express their opinions and be eager to chat. To further develop this novel task, we collect a human-to-human Chinese dialogue dataset \\ts{NewsDialogues}, which includes 1K conversations with a total of 14.6K utterances and detailed annotations for target topics and knowledge spans. Furthermore, we propose a method named Predict-Generate-Rank, consisting of a generator for grounded knowledge prediction and response generation, and a ranker for the ranking of multiple ",

    "translated_abstract": "新闻基础对话长期以来受到任务定义不清晰和数据稀缺的制约。本文提出了一个新颖的任务，即主动引导的新闻基础对话，其中对话系统可以根据新闻的关键话题主动引导对话。此外，该任务包括信息检索和闲聊场景，用户可以就新闻细节提问或表达观点，并渴望进行聊天。为了进一步开发这一新颖任务，我们收集了一个人机中文对话数据集\"NewsDialogues\"，包括1000个对话，共有14.6K个话语，并详细注释了目标话题和知识范围。此外，我们提出了一种名为\"Predict-Generate-Rank\"的方法，包括用于基于知识预测和生成回复的生成器以及用于多个候选回复排序的排序器。",
