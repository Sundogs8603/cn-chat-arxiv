    "translated_abstract": "利用预燃室的湍流射流点火概念是在大型燃气发动机中实现稳定燃烧的一种有前景的解决方案，可以在贫燃烧条件下实现高效率和低排放水平。由于大型燃气发动机预燃室的设计和工作参数范围广泛，评估不同设计的首选方法是计算流体力学（CFD），因为在试验台测量活动中进行测试耗时且昂贵。然而，由于解决底层物理学的复杂性，详细CFD模拟需要很长的计算时间，这也限制了它的适用性。在类似于本例的优化设置中，即在目标函数的计算成本较高的情况下，贝叶斯优化已在很大程度上取代了经典的试验设计。因此，本研究涉及使用CFD模拟进行计算高效的大型燃气发动机预燃室设计的贝叶斯优化。",
