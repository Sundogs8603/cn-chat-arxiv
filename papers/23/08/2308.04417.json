    "abstract": "Optical satellite images are a critical data source; however, cloud cover often compromises their quality, hindering image applications and analysis. Consequently, effectively removing clouds from optical satellite images has emerged as a prominent research direction. While recent advancements in cloud removal primarily rely on generative adversarial networks, which may yield suboptimal image quality, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in diverse image-generation tasks, showcasing their potential in addressing this challenge. This paper presents a novel framework called DiffCR, which leverages conditional guided diffusion with deep convolutional networks for high-performance cloud removal for optical satellite imagery. Specifically, we introduce a decoupled encoder for conditional image feature extraction, providing a robust color representation to ensure the close similarity of appearance information between the conditional input and the synthesized output.

    "translated_abstract": "光学卫星图像是重要的数据来源，然而云覆盖经常会影响它们的质量，阻碍图像应用和分析。因此，有效地从光学卫星图像中去除云层成为一个突出的研究方向。虽然最近云去除的进展主要依赖生成对抗网络，但这可能导致图像质量次优。扩散模型在多样的图像生成任务中展现了显著的成功，显示了其在解决这一挑战中的潜力。本文提出了一种名为DiffCR的新型框架，它利用带有深度卷积网络的条件引导扩散，实现高性能的光学卫星图像云去除。具体而言，我们引入了一种用于条件图像特征提取的解耦编码器，提供了强大的颜色表征，以确保条件输入和合成输出之间的外观信息的紧密相似性。",
