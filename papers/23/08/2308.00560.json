    "translated_abstract": "旅行推销员问题（TSP）是组合优化中的一个众所周知的问题，具有在各个领域的应用。然而，现有的TSP求解器在产生高质量解决方案时面临低延迟的挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了NAR4TSP，它使用一个特别设计的图神经网络（GNN）以非自回归（NAR）方式生成TSP解决方案，实现更快的推理速度。此外，NAR4TSP使用增强的强化学习（RL）策略进行训练，消除了传统监督学习基于NAR模型训练所使用的昂贵标签的依赖关系。据我们所知，NAR4TSP是第一个成功结合了RL和NAR解码的TSP求解器。在合成和真实的TSP实例上的实验结果表明，NAR4TSP在解决方案质量、推理延迟和泛化能力方面优于四个最先进的模型。最后，我们展示了NAR4TSP解码过程的可视化。",
