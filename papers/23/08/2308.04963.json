We leverage recent advances in the literature on graphical methods to provide a unifying framework for guiding empirical practice. The approach integrates and connects to prominent identification and testing strategies in the literature on missing data, causal machine learning, panel data analysis, and more. We demonstrate its utility in the context of identification and specification testing in sample selection models and field experiments with attrition. We provide a novel analysis of a large-scale cluster-randomized controlled teacher's aide trial in Danish schools at grade 6.

    "translated_abstract": "本文关注在数据选择性和/或缺失情况下，因果评估问题的辨认、估计和规范化检验。我们利用图形方法文献中的最新进展，提供一个统一的框架来指导实证研究。这种方法整合并与在缺失数据、因果机器学习、面板数据分析等领域中的著名辨认和检验策略相连接。在样本选择模型和受损实验中的辨认和规范化检验背景下，我们展示了其实用性。我们对丹麦学校六年级的大规模集群随机对照教师助理试验进行了新颖的分析。即使有详细的行政数据，处理缺失数据在关于心理健康影响的整体结论中起着至关重要的作用。结果表明，教学助理提供了一种改善内化行为的有效方法。",
