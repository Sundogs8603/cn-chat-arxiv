Firstly, in order to address the scalability issue of the exploration space, we define a formation-based equivalence relation on the exploration space and aim to reduce the search space by exploring only meaningful states in different formations. Then, we propose a novel formation-aware exploration (FoX) framework that encourages partially observable agents to visit the states in diverse formations by guiding them to be well aware of their current formation solely based on their own observations.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于深度的多智能体强化学习 (MARL) 在各种合作多智能体任务中取得了显著的成功。然而，由于智能体的部分可观测性和随着智能体数量增加而指数增长的探索空间，探索仍然是MARL中的一个具有挑战性的问题。首先，为了解决探索空间的可扩展性问题，我们在探索空间上定义了一个基于形成的等价关系，并旨在通过仅探索不同形式的有意义状态来减少搜索空间。然后，我们提出了一种新颖的形成感知探索 (FoX) 框架，通过引导部分可观测智能体凭借自身观测信息充分了解其当前形成，鼓励他们访问不同形成中的状态。数值结果表明，所提出的FoX框架在Google Research Football上明显优于现有的MARL算法。",
