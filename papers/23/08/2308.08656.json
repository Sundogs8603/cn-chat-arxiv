    "translated_abstract": "已知大规模图像数据集中的偏见会影响计算机视觉模型在地理背景下的性能。为了调查标准互联网数据收集方法在低收入和中等收入国家的限制，我们使用与非洲每个国家相关的带有地理标签的Flickr图像来进行大规模的人为中心图像地理多样性分析。我们报告了可用数据的数量和内容，并与与之对应的欧洲国家进行了比较，以及根据细粒度国内财富估计的数据分布。我们进行了两年一次的时间分析，以揭示出现的数据趋势。此外，我们还呈现了一个“他者化”现象的发现，表明非洲大量图像是由非本地摄影师拍摄的。我们的研究结果表明，还需要进一步工作，以捕捉具有非洲人和他们环境代表性的图像数据。",

The findings indicate biases in the available data and the presence of an \"othering\" phenomenon, highlighting the need for further research to obtain representative image data of African people and their environments."
