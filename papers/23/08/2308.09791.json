    "translated_abstract": "Horse Herd优化算法是一种基于不同年龄的马的行为的新型元启发式算法。最近，HOA被引入来解决复杂和高维问题。本文提出了Horse Herd优化算法的二进制版本（BHOA），以解决离散问题和选择显著特征子集。此外，本研究提供了一种基于BHOA和最小冗余最大相关（MRMR）过滤方法的新型混合特征选择框架。这种更高效的混合特征选择能够产生一组相关且信息丰富的有益特征子集。由于特征选择是一个二进制问题，我们应用了一种新的转换函数（TF），称为X形状TF，将连续问题转换为二进制搜索空间。此外，支持向量机（SVM）被用于检验所提出方法在十个微阵列数据集（即淋巴瘤、前列腺等）上的效率。",
