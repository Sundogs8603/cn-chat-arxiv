    "abstract": "This study considers a model where schools may have multiple priority orders on students, which may be inconsistent with each other. For example, in school choice systems, since the sibling priority and the walk zone priority coexist, the priority orders based on them would be conflicting. In that case, there may be no matching that respect to all priority orders. We introduce a novel fairness notion called M-fairness to examine such markets. Further, we focus on a more specific situation where all schools have two priority orders, and for a certain group of students, a priority order of each school is an improvement of the other priority order of the school. An illustrative example is the school choice matching market with a priority-based affirmative action policy. We introduce a mechanism that utilizes the efficiency adjusted deferred acceptance algorithm and show that the mechanism is student optimally M-stable, improved-group optimally M-stable and responsive to improvements.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究考虑了一种模型，在这种模型中，学校可能对学生有多个优先级顺序，这些顺序可能相互矛盾。例如，在学校选择系统中，由于兄弟姐妹优先级和步行区域优先级并存，基于它们的优先级顺序可能存在冲突。在这种情况下，可能找不到满足所有优先级顺序的匹配。我们引入了一种名为M-fairness的新颖公平性概念来研究这样的市场。此外，我们重点研究了一种更具体的情况，即所有学校都有两个优先级顺序，并且对于某个学生群体，每所学校的一个优先级顺序是另一优先级顺序的改进。一个说明性例子是具有基于优先级的积极行动政策的学校选择匹配市场。我们引入了一种利用效率调整延迟接受算法的机制，并证明该机制是学生最优M稳定的，改进群体最优M稳定的，并且对改进是有响应的。",
