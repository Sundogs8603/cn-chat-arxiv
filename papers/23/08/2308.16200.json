    "translated_abstract": "定量模型对政策制定者和投资者来说是重要的决策因素。准确可靠地预测经济衰退将对社会非常有益。本文评估了使用市场情绪和经济指标（75个解释变量）从1986年1月至2022年6月的美国经济衰退预测的机器学习技术，以月度为频率。为了解决缺失的时间序列数据点的问题，使用自回归积分滑动平均（ARIMA）方法对解释变量进行反向预测。分析从使用Boruta算法、相关矩阵和解决多重共线性问题对高维数据集进行降维开始。然后，建立了各种交叉验证模型，包括概率回归方法和机器学习技术，预测衰退二进制结果。考虑的方法包括Probit、Logit、弹性网络、随机森林、渐变。",
