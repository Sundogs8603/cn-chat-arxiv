    "translated_abstract": "文本匹配是将两个文本进行匹配并确定它们之间的关系的任务，在自然语言处理任务中，如阅读理解和问答系统中有广泛应用。主流方法是通过计算文本表示或通过注意机制与文本进行交互，这在文本匹配任务中有效。然而，对于需要基于常识知识推理的文本，这些模型的性能不足。因此，在本文中，我们引入了一种新的文本匹配模型，称为知识增强的文本匹配模型（KETM），以从外部知识源中丰富上下文表示，以增强我们的模型的理解和推理能力。首先，我们使用Wiktionary检索文本词的定义作为我们的外部知识。其次，我们将文本和知识输入文本匹配模块，提取它们的特征向量。文本匹配模块使用基于知识增强的特征向量进行匹配，以提高匹配性能。最后，我们在几个文本匹配任务上进行了实验评估，并与现有的文本匹配模型进行了比较。实验结果表明，我们的KETM模型在常识知识推理任务上具有更好的性能和鲁棒性。",
