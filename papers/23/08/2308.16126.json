    "translated_abstract": "在计算产品推荐时，检测视觉上相似的图像是一个特别有用的属性。使用预训练的计算机视觉模型提取高级图像特征的嵌入相似性在识别具有相似构成的图像方面展示出了显著的效果。然而，目前缺乏评估这些模型所生成的嵌入的方法，传统的损失和性能度量不能充分捕捉其在图像相似性搜索任务中的性能。本文中，我们使用一种名为CorrEmbed的新方法评估了多个预训练的计算机视觉模型的图像嵌入的可行性。我们的方法计算了图像嵌入中距离和人工标注向量中距离的相关性。我们使用这个度量方法对多个预训练的Torchvision模型进行了广泛的评估，揭示了ImageNet1k准确度得分和标签相关性之间的直线关系。",
