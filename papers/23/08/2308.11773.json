    "abstract": "Language use has been shown to correlate with depression, but large-scale validation is needed. Traditional methods like clinic studies are expensive. So, natural language processing has been employed on social media to predict depression, but limitations remain-lack of validated labels, biased user samples, and no context. Our study identified 29 topics in 3919 smartphone-collected speech recordings from 265 participants using the Whisper tool and BERTopic model. Six topics with a median PHQ-8 greater than or equal to 10 were regarded as risk topics for depression: No Expectations, Sleep, Mental Therapy, Haircut, Studying, and Coursework. To elucidate the topic emergence and associations with depression, we compared behavioral (from wearables) and linguistic characteristics across identified topics. The correlation between topic shifts and changes in depression severity over time was also investigated, indicating the importance of longitudinally monitoring language use. We also tested",

    "translated_abstract": "语言使用已被证明与抑郁相关，但需要大规模验证。传统方法如诊所研究费用高昂。因此，自然语言处理已被应用于社交媒体上预测抑郁，但仍存在一些限制-缺乏验证标签、样本偏差和缺乏上下文。我们的研究使用Whisper工具和BERTopic模型在来自265名参与者的3919个智能手机录音中识别出29个主题。其中6个主题的PHQ-8中位数大于或等于10被视为抑郁的风险主题：没有期望、睡眠、心理治疗、理发、学习和课程。为了阐明主题的出现和与抑郁的关联，我们比较了识别出的主题在行为（来自可穿戴设备）和语言特征方面的差异。还对主题转变和随时间变化的抑郁严重程度之间的相关性进行了研究，表明了长期监测语言使用的重要性。我们还进行了实证研究",
