    "translated_abstract": "归纳知识图谱补全的任务要求模型从训练图谱中学习推理模式，然后可以用来在分离的测试图谱上进行预测。虽然基于规则的方法似乎很适合这个任务，但在实践中，它们的表现明显不如基于图神经网络（GNNs）的最先进方法，如NBFNet。我们假设基于规则的方法表现不佳是由于两个因素：（i）不合理的实体根本没有排名，（ii）在确定给定链接预测答案的置信度时，只考虑了最具信息量的路径。为了分析这些因素的影响，我们研究了一些针对上述问题的规则方法的变体。我们发现，所得到的模型的性能接近NBFNet。至关重要的是，考虑到的变体只使用了NBFNet所依赖的证据的一小部分。",

    "en_tdlr": "An analysis of inductive knowledge graph completion with GNNs and rules reveals that rule-based methods underperform due to the inadequate ranking of implausible entities and the consideration of only the most informative path. Variants of rule-based methods are proposed to address these issues and achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art GNN methods. These variants utilize only a small fraction of the evidence relied upon by the GNN method NBFNet."
