    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）是在图上执行预测任务的最先进模型。现有的GNNs在与图相关的各种任务上表现出色，但在训练和推理过程中存在分布外（OOD）节点的情况下，却很少引起注意。借鉴CV和NLP的概念，我们将OOD节点定义为训练集中未见的节点标签。由于许多网络是由程序自动生成的，现实世界的图往往存在噪音，并且可能包含来自未知分布的节点。本文定义了存在分布外节点的图上学习问题。具体而言，我们的目标是完成两个任务：1）检测不属于已知分布的节点；2）将剩余的节点分类为已知类别之一。我们证明图中的连接模式对于异常值检测具有信息性，并提出了Out-of-Distribution Graph Attention Network (OODGAT)。",
