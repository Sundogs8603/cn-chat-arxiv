    "translated_abstract": "高光谱成像（HSI）结合显微镜和光谱学，用于评估物体中光谱活性化合物的空间分布，并在食品质量控制、制药过程和废物分类等领域具有广泛应用。然而，由于HSI数据集的体积庞大，在有限的数码基础设施中进行分析和存储可能具有挑战性，特别是在废物分类中，速度和数据存储资源有限。此外，像素和变量的选择对于保留化学信息至关重要，因为大多数光谱数据存在显著的冗余。近年来，化学统计学中的高科技发展使得自动化和循证数据缩减成为可能，这可以极大地提高非负矩阵分解（NMF）的速度和性能，NMF是一种广泛应用于HSI数据化学分析的算法。通过恢复分布化合物的纯贡献图和光谱特征，NMF可以提供证据。",
