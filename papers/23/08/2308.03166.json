Albeit achieving remarkable success, existing COD detectors still struggle to obtain precise results in some challenging cases. To handle this problem, we draw inspiration from the prey-vs-predator game that leads preys to develop better camouflage and predators to acquire more acute vision systems and develop algorithms from both the prey side and the predator side. On the prey side, we propose an adversarial training framework, Camouflageator, which introduces an auxiliary generator to generate more camouflaged objects that are harder for a COD method to detect. Camouflageator trains the generator and detector in an adversarial way such that the enhanced auxiliary generator helps produce a stronger detector. On the predator side, we introduce a novel COD method, called Internal Coherence and Edge G",

    "translated_abstract": "伪装物体检测（COD）是一项具有挑战性的任务，旨在识别视觉上融入环境中的伪装物体。尽管取得了显著的成功，现有的COD检测器在一些具有挑战性的情况下仍然难以获得精确的结果。为了解决这个问题，我们从猎物与捕食者的博弈中汲取灵感，这导致猎物发展出更好的伪装能力，而捕食者则获得更敏锐的视觉系统，并从猎物方和捕食者方开发算法。在猎物一侧，我们提出了一个对抗训练框架，Camouflageator，引入一个辅助生成器来生成更难以被COD方法检测到的伪装对象。Camouflageator以对抗的方式训练生成器和检测器，使增强的辅助生成器有助于产生更强大的检测器。",
