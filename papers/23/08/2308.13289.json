    "translated_abstract": "全球金融交易所使用限价单簿（LOB）来处理订单和匹配交易。为了研究目的，需要具有大规模高效的LOB动态模拟器。以前曾在基于代理模型（ABMs），强化学习（RL）环境和生成模型的上下文中实现了LOB模拟器，处理来自历史数据集和手工代理的订单流。对于许多应用程序，需要处理多个订单簿，无论是用于ABM的校准还是RL代理的训练。我们展示了首个能够并行处理数千本订单簿且每个消息处理时间显著减少的GPU-enabled LOB模拟器-JAX-LOB的实现。我们的模拟器JAX-LOB的实现基于设计选择，旨在充分利用JAX的功能，同时不损害与LOB相关的机制的真实性。我们将JAX-LOB与其他JAX包集成，以提供如何适用的示例。",
