    "translated_abstract": "生成式人工智能的发展和新发布的大型语言模型（LLMs）的能力为软件工程提供了新的机遇，但同时也带来了新的网络安全挑战。最近，研究人员已经展示了使用诸如ChatGPT之类的LLMs生成恶意内容的可能性，这些内容可以直接被利用或引导经验不足的黑客武器化工具和代码。这些研究还涵盖了需要攻击者处于循环中的场景。在本研究中，我们利用公开可用的插件，将一个LLM作为攻击者和受害者之间的代理。我们提供了一个概念验证，其中使用ChatGPT传播恶意软件，同时规避检测，并与命令和控制（C2）服务器建立通信，以接收与受害者系统交互的命令。最后，我们介绍了保持不被检测和进行攻击所需的基本要素。",
