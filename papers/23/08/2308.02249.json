    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a computational analysis of the field recording dataset of approximately 700 hours of Korean folk songs, which were recorded around 1980-90s. Because most of the songs were sung by non-expert musicians without accompaniment, the dataset provides several challenges. To address this challenge, we utilized self-supervised learning with convolutional neural network based on pitch contour, then analyzed how the musical concept of tori, a classification system defined by a specific scale, ornamental notes, and an idiomatic melodic contour, is captured by the model. The experimental result shows that our approach can better capture the characteristics of tori compared to traditional pitch histograms. Using our approaches, we have examined how musical discussions proposed in existing academia manifest in the actual field recordings of Korean folk songs.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们介绍了对大约700小时的韩国民歌场录音数据集进行计算机分析，这些录音大多数在1980-90年代录制。由于大部分歌曲都是由非专业音乐家在没有伴奏的情况下演唱的，因此该数据集提供了一些挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们使用基于音调轮廓的卷积神经网络进行了自监督学习，并分析了模型如何捕捉到“托里”这一音乐概念，它是一个基于特定音阶、装饰音和成语化旋律轮廓的分类系统。实验结果表明，与传统的音高直方图相比，我们的方法能够更好地捕捉到“托里”的特征。利用我们的方法，我们研究了现有学术界提出的音乐讨论在韩国民歌实际录音中的表现。",
