    "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples for trusted medical image segmentation remains a significant challenge. The critical issue here is the lack of a strict definition of abnormal data, which often results in artificial problem settings without measurable clinical impact. In this paper, we redesign the OOD detection problem according to the specifics of volumetric medical imaging and related downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation). We propose using the downstream model's performance as a pseudometric between images to define abnormal samples. This approach enables us to weigh different samples based on their performance impact without an explicit ID/OOD distinction. We incorporate this weighting in a new metric called Expected Performance Drop (EPD). EPD is our core contribution to the new problem design, allowing us to rank methods based on their clinical impact. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EPD-based evaluation in 11 CT and MRI OOD detection challenges.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于可信的医学图像分割中的区分概率（OOD）样本的检测仍然是一个重要挑战。关键问题在于缺乏对异常数据的严格定义，这经常导致无法衡量临床影响的人为问题设置。在本文中，我们根据体积医学成像和相关下游任务（例如分割）的特定情况重新设计了OOD检测问题。我们提出使用下游模型的性能作为图像之间异常样本的伪度量。这种方法使我们能够根据性能的影响权衡不同的样本，而无需显式的ID/OOD区分。我们在新的度量标准Expected Performance Drop (EPD) 中加入了这种权重。 EPD是我们对新问题设计的核心贡献，它使我们能够根据其临床影响对方法进行排名。我们在11个CT和MRI OOD检测挑战中展示了EPD评估的有效性。",
