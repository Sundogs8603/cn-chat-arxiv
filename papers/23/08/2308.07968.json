    "translated_abstract": "个性化文本生成是近年来受到广泛关注的新兴研究领域，大多数研究都是通过设计定制的特征或模型来专注于特定领域。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行个性化文本生成的通用方法。受到写作教育实践的启发，我们开发了一个多阶段和多任务的框架来教导LLMs进行个性化生成。在写作指导中，从资源中撰写文章的任务通常被分解为多个步骤，包括查找、评估、总结、综合和整合信息。类似地，我们的个性化文本生成方法包括多个阶段：检索、排序、摘要、综合和生成。此外，我们引入了一个多任务设置，进一步帮助模型提高其生成能力，这受到教育观察到的学生阅读能力和写作能力的启示。",
