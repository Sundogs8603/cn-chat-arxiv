    "translated_abstract": "作为情感分析的关键，情感组合考虑通过子成分的分类和应用于它们的规则对成分进行分类。我们认为，以前广泛研究过的包括未标记和情感树在内的分层树形结构在本质上是次优的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了语义树，一种能够以系统的方式解释情感组合的新树形结构。语义树是上下文无关语法（CFG）的一个派生，描述了不同语义角色上的特定组合规则，其设计经过了之前的语言学结论的精心考虑。然而，由于常规数据集中没有对语义树的注释，语义树是一个潜在变量。因此，在我们的方法中，通过内部算法对其进行边际化，并通过学习优化分类性能。定量和定性结果表明，我们的方法不仅实现了优化的分类性能，还能够解释情感组合的语义。",
