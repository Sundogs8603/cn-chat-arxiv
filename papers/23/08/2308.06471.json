    "abstract": "Intelligent automation supports us against cyclones, droughts, and seismic events with recent technology advancements. Algorithmic learning has advanced fields like neuroscience, genetics, and human-computer interaction. Time-series data boosts progress. Challenges persist in adopting these approaches in traditional fields. Neural networks face comprehension and bias issues. AI's expansion across scientific areas is due to adaptable descriptors and combinatorial argumentation. This article focuses on modeling Forest loss using the VANYA Model, incorporating Prey Predator Dynamics. VANYA predicts forest cover, demonstrated on Amazon Rainforest data against other forecasters like Long Short-Term Memory, N-BEATS, RCN.",
