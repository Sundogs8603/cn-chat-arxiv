    "translated_abstract": "随着恶意软件威胁的增加和更加复杂化，基于机器学习（ML）的恶意软件检测系统变得越来越重要。PDF文件通常被用作钓鱼攻击的矢量，因为它们被广泛认为是可信的数据资源，并且在不同平台上都可以访问。因此，研究人员开发了许多不同的PDF恶意软件检测方法。特征选择对于检测PDF恶意软件的性能有很大影响。在这项研究中，我们提出了一个小型特征集，不需要太多关于PDF文件的领域知识。我们使用六种不同的机器学习模型评估了提出的特征。在使用Random Forest模型时，我们报告了最高99.75%的准确性。我们提出的仅包含12个特征的特征集是PDF恶意软件检测领域中最简洁的之一。尽管规模较小，但我们获得了与采用更大特征集的最先进方法相当的结果。",
