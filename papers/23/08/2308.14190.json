    "translated_abstract": "基于分数的生成模型已经在磁共振成像或计算机断层扫描等医学图像重建任务中展现出高度有前景的效果。然而，他们在正电子发射断层扫描（PET）中的应用仍然相对未知。PET图像重建涉及多种挑战，包括高方差的泊松噪声和广泛的动态范围。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了几种适用于PET的基于分数的生成模型的特定适应方法。我们的方法适用于2D和3D PET，并且提供了使用磁共振图像进行引导重建的扩展。我们通过在没有病变的患者真实数据上进行了广泛的2D和3D的$\\textit{in-silico}$实验中验证了这种方法，并通过没有病变的数据以及带有病变的数据进行了评估。这证明了该方法的鲁棒性和显著的PET重建改进潜力。",
