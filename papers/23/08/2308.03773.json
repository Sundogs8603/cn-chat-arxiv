    "abstract": "Probabilistic generative models of graphs are important tools that enable representation and sampling. Many recent works have created probabilistic models of graphs that are capable of representing not only entity interactions but also their attributes. However, given a generative model of random attributed graph(s), the general conditions that establish goodness of fit are not clear a-priori. In this paper, we define goodness of fit in terms of the mean square contingency coefficient for random binary networks. For this statistic, we outline a procedure for assessing the quality of the structure of a learned attributed graph by ensuring that the discrepancy of the mean square contingency coefficient (constant, or random) is minimal with high probability. We apply these criteria to verify the representation capability of a probabilistic generative model for various popular types of graph models.",

    "translated_abstract": "图的概率生成模型是能够进行表示和抽样的重要工具。许多最近的研究已经创建了能够表示实体间相互作用和属性的图的概率模型。然而，对于一个随机属性图的生成模型，确定其拟合优度的一般条件并不明确。在本文中，我们以随机二进制网络的均方互信息系数为基准来定义拟合优度。对于这个统计量，我们概述了一种用于评估学习到的属性图结构质量的过程，确保均方互信息系数的偏差最小，并且高概率下保持恒定或随机。我们将这些准则应用于验证概率生成模型在各种流行的图模型中的表示能力。",
