    "translated_abstract": "在需要估计的总区域中，仅有部分区域具有采样数据，我们考虑使用随机森林和LASSO方法进行基于模型的小区域估计。采样区域有大量的辅助信息来自调查，而所有区域都有来自外部来源的辅助信息，并且目标是使用辅助变量来预测感兴趣的结果。我们比较了区域级别的随机森林和LASSO方法与频率主义的前向变量选择方法和贝叶斯收缩方法。此外，为了衡量从随机森林和LASSO获得的估计的不确定性，我们提出了一种修改的拆分合规程序，放宽了数据相同分布的假设。这项工作受到了来自加纳第六次生活标准调查（GLSS）和2010年人口和住房普查的数据的启发。我们使用这两个数据集估计了区域的家庭对数消费的均值。",
