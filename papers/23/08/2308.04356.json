    "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of knee bony anatomy is essential in orthopedics, and it has been around for several years in both pre-operative and post-operative settings. While deep learning algorithms have demonstrated exceptional performance in medical image analysis, the assessment of fairness and potential biases within these models remains limited. This study aims to revisit deep learning-powered knee-bony anatomy segmentation using plain radiographs to uncover visible gender and racial biases. The current contribution offers the potential to advance our understanding of biases, and it provides practical insights for researchers and practitioners in medical imaging. The proposed mitigation strategies mitigate gender and racial biases, ensuring fair and unbiased segmentation results. Furthermore, this work promotes equal access to accurate diagnoses and treatment outcomes for diverse patient populations, fostering equitable and inclusive healthcare provision.",

    "translated_abstract": "在骨科学中，自动分割膝关节骨部解剖结构十分重要，并且在术前和术后环境中已经有了几年的应用。深度学习算法在医学图像分析中已经展示出了卓越的性能，但对于这些模型中的公平性和潜在偏见的评估仍然有限。本研究的目标是重新审视使用常规X光片进行深度学习驱动的膝关节骨解剖结构分割，以揭示可见的性别和种族偏见。本研究的贡献在于提供了一个推进我们对偏见的理解的机会，并为医学影像研究人员和从业者提供了实用的见解。提出的缓解策略可以缓解性别和种族偏见，确保公正和无偏见的分割结果。此外，本研究促进了多样化患者人群获得准确诊断和治疗结果的平等机会，推动了公平和包容的医疗保障。",
