    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce the notion of Context-Based Prediction Models. A Context-Based Prediction Model determines the probability of a user's action (such as a click or a conversion) solely by relying on user and contextual features, without considering any specific features of the item itself. We have identified numerous valuable applications for this modeling approach, including training an auxiliary context-based model to estimate click probability and incorporating its prediction as a feature in CTR prediction models. Our experiments indicate that this enhancement brings significant improvements in offline and online business metrics while having minimal impact on the cost of serving. Overall, our work offers a simple and scalable, yet powerful approach for enhancing the performance of large-scale commercial recommender systems, with broad implications for the field of personalized recommendations.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们引入了上下文预测模型的概念。上下文预测模型仅依赖于用户和上下文特征，而不考虑物品本身的特定特征，来确定用户行为（如点击或转化）的概率。我们发现了许多有价值的应用场景，包括训练辅助的基于上下文的模型来估计点击概率，并将其预测结果作为CTR预测模型的特征。我们的实验表明，这种改进在离线和在线业务指标上带来了显著的改进，而对服务成本几乎没有影响。总体而言，我们的工作提供了一种简单而可扩展，但强大的方法，用于增强大规模商业推荐系统的性能，并对个性化推荐领域具有广泛影响。",
