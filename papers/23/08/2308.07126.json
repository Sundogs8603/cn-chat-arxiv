    "translated_abstract": "时间演变的数据集通常可以组织成一个高阶张量，其中的一个模式是时间模式。虽然张量分解已经成功地用于捕捉这类高阶数据集中的潜在模式，但往往忽略了时间的因素，允许时间点的重新排序。在最近的研究中，引入了时间正则化器来解决这个问题。然而，现有方法仍然不允许潜在模式在时间上发生变化（例如，大脑中的空间变化，主题中的上下文变化）。本文中，我们提出了一种基于PARAFAC2的时空张量分解方法tPARAFAC2，通过时间正则化器从时间数据中提取逐渐演变的模式。通过对合成数据的大量实验，我们证明了tPARAFAC2能够准确地捕捉到演变中的潜在模式，表现优于PARAFAC2和带有时间平滑正则化的耦合矩阵分解方法。",
