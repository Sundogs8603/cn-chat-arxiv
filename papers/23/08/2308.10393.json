    "translated_abstract": "过去关于带有时序逻辑规范的机器人规划的研究主要基于单一公式，用于单个或多个机器人的任务。但是随着任务复杂性的增加，时序逻辑公式不可避免地变得冗长，使解释和规范生成变得复杂，并且对规划器的计算能力产生压力。最近的发展是提出了时序逻辑的分层表示，其中包含多个时序逻辑规范，提供更可解释的框架。然而，所提出的规划算法假设每个规范中的机器人是独立的，限制了它们在具有复杂时间约束的多机器人协调中的应用。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于分解的分层框架。在高层，每个规范首先被分解成一组原子子任务。我们进一步推断不同规范的子任务之间的时序关系来确ete机器人间的协作。",

The framework decomposes each specification into atomic sub-tasks and infers temporal relations among sub-tasks of different specifications to enable robot coordination."
