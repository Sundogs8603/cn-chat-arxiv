    "abstract": "This paper presents an end-to-end high-quality singing voice synthesis (SVS) system that uses bidirectional encoder representation from Transformers (BERT) derived semantic embeddings to improve the expressiveness of the synthesized singing voice. Based on the main architecture of recently proposed VISinger, we put forward several specific designs for expressive singing voice synthesis. First, different from the previous SVS models, we use text representation of lyrics extracted from pre-trained BERT as additional input to the model. The representation contains information about semantics of the lyrics, which could help SVS system produce more expressive and natural voice. Second, we further introduce an energy predictor to stabilize the synthesized voice and model the wider range of energy variations that also contribute to the expressiveness of singing voice. Last but not the least, to attenuate the off-key issues, the pitch predictor is re-designed to predict the real to note pitch ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种端到端的高质量歌声合成（SVS）系统，该系统使用来自Transformers（BERT）的双向编码器表示衍生的语义嵌入来提高合成歌声的表达力。基于最近提出的VISinger的主要架构，我们提出了几种特定的设计用于表达性歌声合成。首先，与以往的SVS模型不同，我们使用从预训练BERT中提取的歌词的文本表示作为模型的附加输入。这个表示包含了关于歌词语义的信息，可以帮助SVS系统产生更富有表现力和自然的声音。其次，我们进一步引入了一个能量预测器来稳定合成声音，并对能量变化的更广泛范围进行建模，这也有助于歌声的表达力。最后，为了减小音高问题，重新设计了音高预测器来预测实际到音符的音高。",
