    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一种对多个窃听者的安全通信的深度学习辅助联合源信道编码（Deep-JSCC）方法的推广。我们提出了一种基于端到端（E2E）学习的方法，用于在复值衰落信道上抵御多个窃听者的安全通信。我们研究了窃听者合谋和非合谋的情况。对于合谋策略，窃听者共享其逻辑以基于集成学习方法共同推测私有属性，而对于非合谋设置，他们独自行动。目标是防止窃听者推测有关传输图像的私人（敏感）信息，同时以最小失真将图像传递给合法接收者。通过推广隐私漏斗和窃听信道编码的思想，刻画了合法节点图像恢复与信息泄漏给窃听者之间的权衡。为了解决这个保密漏斗框架，我们实现了...",
