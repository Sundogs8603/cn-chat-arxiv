    "translated_abstract": "传染病预测是防控流行病的关键，并被证明具有重要性。最近的趋势是基于图神经网络（GNN）开发预测模型。然而，现有的基于GNN的方法存在两个关键限制：（1）当前模型通过缩放GNN的深度来扩大感受野，但这对于保留远距离但与流行病相关的地区之间的语义不足够。（2）以前的方法模拟单一空间尺度内的流行病，而忽视了不同尺度上导出的多尺度流行病模式。为了解决这些缺陷，我们设计了基于创新的多尺度视图的多尺度时空图神经网络（MSGNN）。具体来说，在提出的MSGNN模型中，我们首先设计了一个新颖的图学习模块，它直接捕捉跨区域流行病信号的远距离连接，并将它们集成到一个多尺度图中。基于学习的多尺度图，我们使用空间-时间GCN进行流行病预测。",
