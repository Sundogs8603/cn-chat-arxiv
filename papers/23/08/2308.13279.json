    "translated_abstract": "非欧几里得空间由于许多现实世界数据集的分层结构（无论是隐式还是显式）而成为表示数据的流行选择。随之而来的是需要能够在非欧几里得空间中解决分类等基本任务的算法。最近，有多篇论文研究了非欧几里得空间中基于超平面的分类器（如逻辑回归和支持向量机）的替代方法。虽然有效，但这些方法在处理更复杂的分层数据时存在困难。因此，我们提出将众所周知的随机森林推广到非欧几里得空间。我们通过使用水平球重新定义了分割的概念来实现这一点。由于找到全局最优分割是计算上难以处理的，我们通过一个大边界分类器找到候选的水平球。为了使非欧几里得随机森林适用于多类数据和不平衡实验，我们还概述了一种基于它们的最低公共祖先和类平衡的类组合方法。",
