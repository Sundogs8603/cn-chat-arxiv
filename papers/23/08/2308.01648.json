    "translated_abstract": "风阻控制是四旋翼飞行器的一个重要特性，用于维持其位置，避免偏离目标位置并防止与障碍物碰撞。传统上，级联PID控制器被用于四旋翼飞行器的控制，因为它简单易用，可以调节其参数。然而，它对风扰动表现较弱，四旋翼飞行器很容易偏离目标位置。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于剩余强化学习的方法来构建四旋翼飞行器的风阻控制器。通过仅学习补偿扰动的剩余部分，我们可以继续使用级联PID控制器作为四旋翼飞行器的基本控制器，同时提高其抗风扰动的性能。为了避免四旋翼飞行器意外坠毁和破坏，我们的方法不需要实际硬件进行数据收集和训练。控制器仅在模拟器上进行训练，并直接应用于目标硬件，无需额外微调。",
