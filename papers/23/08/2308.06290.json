    "translated_abstract": "机器学习可视化(VIS4ML)研究旨在帮助专家应用其先前知识来开发、理解和改进机器学习模型的性能。在构思VIS4ML系统时，研究人员对支持人机交互任务的人类知识进行了表征，设计了交互式可视化以使机器学习组件可解释并引出知识，并评估了人机互换的有效性。我们调查了最近的VIS4ML论文，以评估研究贡献和推动人机交互机器学习的普适性。我们的结果显示，当前VIS4ML研究的范围与实际应用的期望之间存在潜在差距。我们发现，虽然论文认为VIS4ML系统适用于研究之外的条件，但结论往往过度拟合非代表性场景，基于与少量机器学习专家和众所周知数据集的互动，未能承认关键依赖因素。",
    "tldr": "VIS4ML研究在推广实践应用方面存在差异，需要填补未被代表性情况过度拟合、缺乏关键依赖因素的空白。"
