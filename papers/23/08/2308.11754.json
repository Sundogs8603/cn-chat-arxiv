    "translated_abstract": "恶意域名检测是一个开放的安全挑战，旨在检测互联网域名是否与网络攻击相关联。在许多方法中，图神经网络（GNNs）被认为非常有效。基于GNN的恶意域名检测使用DNS日志将互联网域名表示为恶意性图（DMG）中的节点，并训练GNN通过利用已经识别的恶意域名推断其恶意性。由于该方法依赖于可访问的DNS日志来构建DMGs，因此它为攻击者操纵其域名节点在DMGs中的特征和连接暴露了一个漏洞。现有研究主要集中于操纵单个攻击者节点的威胁模型。然而，攻击者通常生成多个域名以经济方式实现其目标并避免被检测。他们的目标是在尽可能多的域名中逃避发现。在这项工作中，我们称同时操纵DMG中的多个节点的攻击为多实例对抗攻击。",
