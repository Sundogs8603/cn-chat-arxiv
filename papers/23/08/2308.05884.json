    "abstract": "With the emergence of increasingly powerful large language models, there is a burgeoning interest in leveraging these models for casual conversation and role-play applications. However, existing conversational and role-playing datasets often fail to capture the diverse and nuanced interactions typically exhibited by real-world role-play participants. To address this limitation and contribute to the rapidly growing field, we introduce a partially-synthetic dataset named PIPPA (Personal Interaction Pairs between People and AI). PIPPA is a result of a community-driven crowdsourcing effort involving a group of role-play enthusiasts. The dataset comprises over 1 million utterances that are distributed across 26,000 conversation sessions and provides a rich resource for researchers and AI developers to explore and refine conversational AI systems in the context of role-play scenarios.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着越来越强大的大型语言模型的出现，人们越来越有兴趣利用这些模型进行非正式对话和角色扮演应用。然而，现有的对话和角色扮演数据集往往无法捕捉到真实世界角色扮演参与者所展示的多样和微妙的交互。为了解决这个限制并为这个快速发展的领域做出贡献，我们引入了一个部分合成的数据集PIPPA（人与AI之间的个人交互对）。PIPPA是一个由一群角色扮演爱好者参与的社区驱动的众包努力的结果。该数据集包含了分布在26,000个对话会话中的超过100万个话语，为研究人员和AI开发人员在角色扮演场景中探索和完善对话AI系统提供了丰富的资源。",
