    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型经常学会依赖于性别和种族等敏感社会属性进行预测，这在社会应用中，如招聘、银行和刑事司法中，带来重大公平风险。现有工作通过减少模型中与社会属性相关的信息来解决这个问题。然而，目标任务和这些社会属性之间的高相关性使得在目标任务上的学习与去偏不兼容。鉴于模型偏见是由于学习偏见特征（例如性别）来优化目标任务而引起的，我们探讨以下研究问题：我们是否可以利用快捷特征来替代偏见特征在去偏的目标任务优化中的作用？为此，我们提出了“快捷去偏”的方法，首先将目标任务对偏见属性的学习从偏见特征转移到快捷特征上，然后采用因果干预来消除偏见特征的影响。",
