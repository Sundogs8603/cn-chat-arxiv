    "translated_abstract": "在许多领域中，多元时间序列中的异常检测是一个重要问题。由于异常在真实数据中的稀疏性，使得分类算法在解决异常检测问题时面临挑战。基于深度神经网络（如LSTM、自编码器、卷积自编码器等）的方法在这种不平衡数据中取得了积极的结果。然而，当应用于多元时间序列时，算法面临的主要挑战是异常可能来自特征集的一个小子集。为了提高这些基本模型的性能，我们提出了一种特征装袋技术，每次只考虑特征的一个子集，并且我们进一步应用了基于主成分分析（PCA）计算的嵌套旋转的转换来改善方法的有效性和泛化能力。为了进一步提高预测性能，我们提出了一种集成技术，将多个基本模型结合在一起。",
