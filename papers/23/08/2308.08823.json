    "translated_abstract": "图形主动学习（Graph Active Learning，简称GAL）旨在寻找图中最具信息量的节点进行注释，以最大化图神经网络（Graph Neural Networks，简称GNNs）的性能，吸引了许多研究工作，但仍存在一些非常困难的挑战。其中一个主要挑战是，现有的GAL策略可能会引入语义混淆到选择的训练集中，尤其是在图形嘈杂的情况下。具体来说，大多数现有方法都假设所有聚合特征都是有用的，忽视了在消息传递机制下类间边缘之间的语义负面影响。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种用于图的语义感知主动学习框架（Semantic-aware Active learning framework for Graphs，简称SAG）来缓解语义混淆问题。引入节点之间带有语义特征的成对相似度和不相似度来共同评估节点影响力。还设计了一种新的基于样本集的准则和查询策略，分别用于维持所选节点的多样性和类别平衡。在公共数据集上进行了大量实验证明了SAG方法的有效性。",
