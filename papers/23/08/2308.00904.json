    "translated_abstract": "因果推断在流行病学、医疗保健和经济学等领域中起着重要作用。在观察数据中进行去混淆和反事实预测已经成为因果推断研究中的一个重要问题。虽然现有模型可以处理观察到的混淆变量，但未观测到的混淆变量的存在仍然是一个重大挑战，扭曲了因果推断并影响了反事实结果的准确性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新颖的可变参数学习模型，用于反事实推断中的未观测混淆变量（VLUCI），它生成了未观测混淆变量的后验分布。VLUCI放松了大多数因果推断方法往往忽视的无混淆假设。通过解耦观察到的混淆变量和未观测到的混淆变量，VLUCI构建了一个双重变分推断模型，以近似未观测混淆变量的分布，这些变量用于推断更准确的反事实结果。对合成和实际数据上进行了大量实验。",
