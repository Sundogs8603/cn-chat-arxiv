    "translated_abstract": "我们扩展了Niepelt（2022年）的实际商业周期模型，分析引入中央银行数字货币（CBDC）后面临的金融稳定风险。CBDC与商业银行存款竞争，成为家庭的流动性来源。我们考虑了支付工具之间的不同可替代性程度，并通过引入银行从中央银行借款时必须遵守的抵押约束来审查Niepelt（2022年）中的等价结果。当CBDC和存款完全可替代时，中央银行可以向银行提供贷款，使引入CBDC对实体经济中性。我们表明，中央银行的贷款利率的最优水平取决于抵押约束的限制性程度：抵押约束越严格，中央银行需要发布的贷款利率越低。然而，当CBDC和存款不完全可替代时，中央银行无法使银行对来自CBDC的竞争无所适从。因此，引入CBDC后将出现负面影响。",
