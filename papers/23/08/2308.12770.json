    "translated_abstract": "最近在零-shot语音合成方面的突破使得只用几秒钟的录音就能模仿说话者的声音，并且保持高度的真实感。除了潜在的好处之外，这项强大的技术还带来了明显的风险，包括语音欺诈和冒充说话者。与仅依赖被动方法来检测合成数据的传统方法不同，水印技术提供了一种积极且强大的防御机制来应对这些潜在风险。本文介绍了一种创新的音频水印技术框架，可以在仅1秒的音频片段中编码多达32位的水印。水印对人类感官来说是无法察觉的，并且对各种攻击表现出强大的韧性。它可以作为合成声音的有效标识符，并在音频版权保护的更广泛应用中具有潜力。此外，这个框架具有很高的灵活性，可以将多个水印片段进行组合以实现更加丰富的功能。",
