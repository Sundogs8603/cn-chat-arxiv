    "abstract": "This whitepaper introduces an innovative mechanism for pricing perpetual contracts and quoting fees to traders based on current market conditions. The approach employs liquidity curves and on-chain oracles to establish a new adaptive pricing framework that considers various factors, ensuring pricing stability and predictability. The framework utilizes parabolic and sigmoid functions to quote prices and fees, accounting for liquidity, active long and short positions, and utilization. This whitepaper provides a detailed explanation of how the adaptive pricing framework, in conjunction with liquidity curves, operates through mathematical modeling and compares it to existing solutions. Furthermore, we explore additional features that enhance the overall efficiency of the decentralized perpetual protocol.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种创新的机制，用于根据当前市场条件为永续合约定价和对交易者报价费用。该方法利用流动性曲线和链上预言机建立了一种新的自适应定价框架，考虑了各种因素，确保定价的稳定性和可预测性。该框架利用抛物线和S形函数报价价格和费用，考虑了流动性、活跃的多头和空头头寸以及利用率。本文通过数学建模详细解释了自适应定价框架与流动性曲线的操作，并将其与现有解决方案进行了比较。此外，我们探讨了增强去中心化永续协议整体效率的其他功能。",
