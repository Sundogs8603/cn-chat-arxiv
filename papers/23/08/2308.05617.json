    "translated_abstract": "離散选择模型在经济学、市场营销和收益管理中被用来预测客户购买概率，例如根据价格和其他特征进行预测。虽然它们已经被证明具有表达能力，可以捕捉到客户的异质性和行为，但是它们很难估计，通常基于许多无法观测到的效用，而且它们仍然无法捕捉到客户行为的许多显著特征。因此，一个自然的问题就是，鉴于它们在其他环境中的成功，是否神经网络可以消除仔细构建一个依赖于上下文的客户行为模型以及手工编码和调整估计的必要性。然而，如何将商品组合效果纳入这样一个神经网络以及如何使用这样一个黑盒生成模型进行商品组合优化的问题尚不清楚。在本文中，我们首先研究了一个单一的神经网络结构是否能够预测购买概率。",
