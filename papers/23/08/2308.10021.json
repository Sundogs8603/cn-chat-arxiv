    "translated_abstract": "唱歌技巧转换（STC）是指在保持原始歌手身份、旋律和语言组成不变的情况下，将一种声乐技巧转换为另一种声乐技巧的任务。先前的STC研究以及一般的歌声转换研究都使用了卷积自编码器（CAE）进行转换，但CAE的瓶颈宽度对合成质量的影响尚未得到彻底评估。为此，我们构建了一个基于GAN的多域STC系统，该系统利用了WORLD声码器表征和CAE架构。我们改变了CAE的瓶颈宽度，并主观评估了转换结果。该模型在一个包括四位歌手和四种唱歌技巧（胸声、假声、嘶哑声和哨音声）的普通话数据集上进行了训练。结果表明，更宽的瓶颈对于发音清晰度更好，但不一定导致更接近目标声音的相似度。",
