    "translated_abstract": "在核能生产、废物管理和核监督的安全、效率和可持续性方面，对已用核燃料（SNF）特性的准确计算和不确定性量化起着关键作用。虽然现有的基于物理模型是可靠的，但计算复杂且耗时。本文提出了一种使用神经网络（NN）的代理模型方法，以降低计算成本来预测一系列SNF特性。通过从CASMO5晶格计算生成的数据进行训练，该NN能够准确预测SNF的衰变热和核素浓度，并具有关键输入参数（如富集度、燃耗、循环之间的冷却时间、平均硼浓度和燃料温度）的函数关系。该模型经过基于物理模型的衰变热模拟验证，并与来自两种不同压水类型反应堆的不同铀氧化物燃料组件的测试结果进行了对比。",
