    "translated_abstract": "提取有意义的药物相关信息块，如不良药物事件（ADE），对于预防疾病和拯救许多生命至关重要。大多数ADE是通过医疗背景下的非结构化对话报告的。因此，应用通用实体识别方法是不足够的。关键在于如何整合和对齐多个关键方面来检测药物事件信息，包括药物事件语义、句法结构和医学领域术语。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的多方面交叉整合框架，通过从药物相关文档中捕捉和对齐不同的上下文/语言/知识属性，用于药物实体/事件检测。我们首先构建多方面编码器来描述语义、句法和医学文档上下文信息，方法包括槽标注任务、主要药物实体/事件检测、词性标注和通用医学命名实体识别。然后，每个编码器进行交叉整合。",
