We introduce a framework to evaluate the ChatGPT models on regression-based problems, such as intensity ranking p",

    "translated_abstract": "随着基础模型的崛起，一个新的人工智能范式出现了，即通过使用通用目的的基础模型，通过提示来解决问题，而不是为每个问题训练单独的机器学习模型。这些模型已经显示出解决一些最初未经训练的问题的新性质。对于这类模型的有效性的研究还相当有限。在这项工作中，我们广泛研究了ChatGPT模型（即GPT-4和GPT-3.5）在13个情感计算问题上的能力，包括方面提取、方面极性分类、意见提取、情感分析、情感强度排序、情绪强度排序、自杀倾向检测、毒性检测、福祉评估、参与度测量、人格评估、讽刺检测和主观性检测。我们介绍了一个评估ChatGPT模型在回归问题上的框架，比如强度排序。",
