    "translated_abstract": "在AGI研究中，构建具有自适应行为的人工智能以进行人工智能和人类的合作成为一个关键关注点。目前，开发合作代理人的方法主要依赖于基于学习的方法，其中政策泛化严重依赖于与特定队友的过去互动。这些方法限制了代理人在面对新的队友时重新校准策略的能力。我们提出了ProAgent，这是一个新颖的框架，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）来创建一个具有预测队友未来决策能力和为自身制定增强计划能力的主动代理。ProAgent在合作推理方面表现出色，能够动态调整行为以增强与队友的协作努力。此外，ProAgent框架具有高度的模块化和可解释性，便于无缝集成，以应对各种协调场景。",
