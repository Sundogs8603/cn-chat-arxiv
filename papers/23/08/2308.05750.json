    "translated_abstract": "化学和生物质处理系统每天都将挥发性物质化合物排放到环境中。催化重整可以将这些化合物转化为有价值的燃料，但开发稳定和高效的催化剂具有挑战性。机器学习可以处理大数据中的复杂关系并优化反应条件，因此是解决这些问题的有效解决方案。本研究是第一个基于机器学习的研究框架，用于对挥发性物质化合物的催化蒸汽重整进行建模、理解和优化。以甲苯催化蒸汽重整为案例研究，展示了化学/纹理分析（例如X射线衍射分析）如何用于获取机器学习模型的输入特征。利用文献编制了一个涵盖各种催化剂特性和反应条件的数据库。通过六个机器学习模型对该过程进行了深入分析、机理讨论和建模，最终得出相关结果。",
