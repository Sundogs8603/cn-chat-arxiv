    "abstract": "This is an experiential study of investigating a consistent method for deriving the correlation between sentence vector and semantic meaning of a sentence. We first used three state-of-the-art word/sentence embedding methods including GPT-3, Word2Vec, and Sentence-BERT, to embed plain text sentence strings into high dimensional spaces. Then we compute the pairwise distance between any possible combination of two sentence vectors in an embedding space and map them into a matrix. Based on each distance matrix, we compute the correlation of distances of a sentence vector with respect to the other sentence vectors in an embedding space. Then we compute the correlation of each pair of the distance matrices. We observed correlations of the same sentence in different embedding spaces and correlations of different sentences in the same embedding space. These observations are consistent with our hypothesis and take us to the next stage.",

    "translated_abstract": "这是一项实证研究，旨在探索一种一致的方法，用于推导句向量与句子语义之间的相关性。我们首先使用三种最先进的词/句子嵌入方法，包括GPT-3，Word2Vec和Sentence-BERT，将纯文本句子字符串嵌入到高维空间中。然后我们计算嵌入空间中任意两个句向量的配对距离，并将其映射到一个矩阵中。根据每个距离矩阵，我们计算句向量相对于其他句向量的距离的相关性。然后我们计算距离矩阵对的相关性。我们观察到相同句子在不同嵌入空间中的相关性，以及在同一嵌入空间中不同句子的相关性。这些观察结果与我们的假设一致，并带领我们进入下一个阶段。",
