    "abstract": "The traditional dietary recommendation systems are basically nutrition or health-aware where the human feelings on food are ignored. Human affects vary when it comes to food cravings, and not all foods are appealing in all moods. A questionnaire-based and preference-aware meal recommendation system can be a solution. However, automated recognition of social affects on different foods and planning the menu considering nutritional demand and social-affect has some significant benefits of the questionnaire-based and preference-aware meal recommendations. A patient with severe illness, a person in a coma, or patients with locked-in syndrome and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cannot express their meal preferences. Therefore, the proposed framework includes a social-affective computing module to recognize the affects of different meals where the person's affect is detected using electroencephalography signals. EEG allows to capture the brain signals and analyze them to anticipate affect",

    "translated_abstract": "传统的饮食推荐系统基本上只考虑营养或健康，忽略了人们对食物的感受。人们在食欲上有所差异，不同的心情下并不是所有食物都令人愉悦。基于问卷和偏好的餐食推荐系统可以是一个解决方案。然而，自动识别不同食物对社交情感的影响，并考虑营养需求和社交情感来规划菜单，具有问卷和偏好餐食推荐的一些显著优势。严重疾病的患者、昏迷中的人或患有锁定综合征和肌萎缩性侧索硬化症（ALS）的患者无法表达他们的餐食偏好。因此，提出的框架包括一个社交情感计算模块，可以通过脑电图信号来识别不同餐食的情感。",
