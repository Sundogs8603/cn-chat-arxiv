The objective of this study was to compare the effect of different age groups in classifying ASD using morphological features (MF) and morphological connectivity features (MCF). Methods: The structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data for the study was obtained from the two publicly available databases, ABIDE-I and ABIDE-II.
