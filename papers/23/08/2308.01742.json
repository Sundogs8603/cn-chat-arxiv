    "translated_abstract": "标签分布学习（LDL）是一种新的机器学习范式，它为每个实例分配一个标签分布。许多LDL方法提出在学习过程中利用标签相关性来解决指数大小的输出空间；其中许多方法利用标签分布的低秩结构来捕捉标签相关性。然而，最近的研究表明，标签分布矩阵通常是满秩的，给利用低秩标签相关性的工作带来了挑战。需要注意的是，多标签通常是低秩的；低秩标签相关性在多标签学习（MLL）文献中被广泛采用。受此启发，我们在LDL中引入了辅助的MLL过程，并在MLL而不是LDL中捕捉低秩标签相关性。通过这种方式，我们恰当地利用了低秩标签相关性在我们的LDL方法中。我们进行了全面的实验，并证明了我们的方法优于现有的LDL方法。",
