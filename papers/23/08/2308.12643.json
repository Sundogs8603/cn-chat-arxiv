First, token frequency does not dominate the productivity measure but naturally influences the sampling of bases. Second, we are not just counting attested word types with an affix but rather simulating the construction of these types and then checking whether they are attested in the corpus.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的衡量语言生产力的方法，该方法客观评估了一个词缀用于构建新复杂词的能力，与其他常用的衡量方法不同的是，它不直接依赖于词频。具体而言，作者建议将语言生产力视为一个词缀与随机词根组合的概率。这种方法的优势包括：首先，词频不会主导生产力的衡量，而是自然地影响基础样本的抽样。其次，我们不仅仅是计算带有词缀的已验证词汇类型，而是模拟构造这些类型，然后检查它们是否出现在语料库中。第三，以语料库为基础的方法和随机设计确保真正的新词和早期构词具有相等的选择机会。所提出的算法在英语和俄语数据上进行了评估。所得结果为我们提供了一些有价值的见解，涉及词缀与词根的关系。",
