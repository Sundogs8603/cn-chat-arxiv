    "abstract": "A fiduciary is a trusted agent that has the legal duty to act with loyalty and care towards a principal that employs them. When fiduciary organizations interact with users through a digital interface, or otherwise automate their operations with artificial intelligence, they will need to design these AI systems to be compliant with their duties. This article synthesizes recent work in computer science and law to develop a procedure for designing and auditing Fiduciary AI. The designer of a Fiduciary AI should understand the context of the system, identify its principals, and assess the best interests of those principals. Then the designer must be loyal with respect to those interests, and careful in an contextually appropriate way. We connect the steps in this procedure to dimensions of Trustworthy AI, such as privacy and alignment. Fiduciary AI is a promising means to address the incompleteness of data subject's consent when interacting with complex technical systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "信托人是一位受信任的代理人，具有对雇佣他们的委托人以忠诚和关心的法律义务。当信托组织通过数字界面与用户交互，或以人工智能方式自动化其操作时，他们需要设计这些人工智能系统以符合他们的职责。本文综合了计算机科学和法律领域的最新研究，提出了一种设计和审计信托人工智能的方法。信托人工智能的设计者应了解系统的背景，确定其委托人，并评估这些委托人的最佳利益。然后，设计者必须以与利益相关的方式忠诚且谨慎。我们将此过程中的步骤与可信人工智能的维度（如隐私和一致性）联系起来。信托人工智能是解决数据主体在与复杂技术系统交互时同意不完全性的一种有前景的方法。",
