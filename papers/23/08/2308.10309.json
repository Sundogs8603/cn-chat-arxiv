    "title": "Digital Real Estate in the Metaverse: An Empirical Analysis of Retail Investor Motivations. (arXiv:2308.10309v1 [q-fin.GN])",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates retail investor motivations for digital real estate ownership in the crypto-metaverse. Utilizing a detailed financial behavior survey of metaverse landowners' intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, we apply principal components analysis to uncover four distinct motivational groups: (1) Aesthetics and Identity, (2) Social and Community, (3) Speculation and Investment, and (4) Innovation and Technology. Our findings reveal that age, education, investment knowledge, risk-taking, and impulsivity significantly influence investor group membership. This research provides valuable insights to investors and developers, underscoring the potential of a platform to attract retail investors with speculative intentions, engagement longevity, and passive or active trading characteristics, contingent on unique crypto-metaverse attributes.",
