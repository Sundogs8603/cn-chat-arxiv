    "translated_abstract": "在线社交网络平台和应用的指数级增长导致了用户生成的文本内容（包括评论和评价）数量的激增。因此，用户通常在从这些内容中提取有价值的见解或相关信息时面临困难。为了解决这一挑战，机器学习和自然语言处理算法已被用于分析在线可获得的大量文本数据。近年来，主题建模技术在这个领域中取得了显著的流行度。在本研究中，我们全面地研究并比较了五种经常使用的主题建模方法，特别是应用于客户评论的方法。所研究的方法包括潜在语义分析（LSA）、潜在狄利克雷分配（LDA）、非负矩阵分解（NMF）、彩球推理模型（PAM）、Top2Vec和BERTopic。通过实际展示它们在检测重要主题方面的优势，我们旨在突出它们的有效性。",
