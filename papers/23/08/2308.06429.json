    "translated_abstract": "通过基因组关联研究(GWAS)，我们可以通过比较患有特定疾病和未患病个体的基因数据来确定疾病易感的基因变量。然而，这些关联的发现由于遗传异质性和特征交互而面临着重大挑战。这些受到这些影响的基因变量通常表现出较低的效应大小，因此使用机器学习特征选择方法很难检测到它们。为了解决这些挑战，本文介绍了一种新颖的GWAS特征选择机制，名为Feature Co-selection Network (FCSNet)。FCS-Net旨在从基于遗传算法(GA)和进化学习算法的多个独立特征选择运行构建的网络中提取遗传变量的异质子集。我们采用非线性机器学习算法来检测特征交互。我们引入了一个综合特征风险评分(CRS)来解释基因变量之间的关联。",
