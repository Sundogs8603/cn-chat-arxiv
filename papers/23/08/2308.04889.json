    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）领域中的生成式人工智能（Generative Artificial Intelligence，特别是自然语言处理（Natural Language Processing，NLP）和机器学习（Machine Learning，ML））信息的快速增长给研究人员和从业者带来了巨大的挑战，使得他们难以跟上最新的发展。为了解决信息过载的问题，Bielefeld大学的自然语言学习组在本报告中专注于识别arXiv上最受欢迎的论文，特别关注NLP和ML。其目标是为最相关且被广泛讨论的研究提供快速指南，以帮助新来者和已有研究人员跟上当前趋势。具体而言，我们根据2023年上半年的标准化引用计数编制了一个由40篇最受欢迎的论文组成的列表。我们观察到在2023年上半年，与大型语言模型（Large Language Models，LLMs）和具体而言的ChatGPT相关的论文占主导地位，而ChatGPT显示出下降的趋势。",
