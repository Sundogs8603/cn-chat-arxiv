    "translated_abstract": "全球可持续发展需要低碳城市交通系统，这需要适当的基础设施，低碳交通方式的推广和出行行为的改变。为了正确实施基础设施变革，了解建筑环境对出行的影响的地理特定的因果关系机制至关重要。然而，目前的研究在表示6D城市形态变量和出行之间的因果关系、在不同地区之间进行泛化以及在高空间分辨率下建模城市形态效应方面存在不足。在本研究中，我们利用因果发现和可解释的机器学习框架，根据三个大洲六个城市的高分辨率出行数据，检测城市形态对城市内出行的影响，并填补了这三个差距。我们发现，距离市中心、人口统计数据和密度间接影响其他城市形态特征。通过考虑这些因果关系，我们发现地理位置对不同城市之间的交通方式选择产生了影响。",
