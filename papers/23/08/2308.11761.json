    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive impact in the field of natural language processing, but they still struggle with several issues regarding, such as completeness, timeliness, faithfulness and adaptability. While recent efforts have focuses on connecting LLMs with external knowledge sources, the integration of knowledge bases (KBs) remains understudied and faces several challenges. In this paper, we introduce KnowledGPT, a comprehensive framework to bridge LLMs with various knowledge bases, facilitating both the retrieval and storage of knowledge. The retrieval process employs the program of thought prompting, which generates search language for KBs in code format with pre-defined functions for KB operations. Besides retrieval, KnowledGPT offers the capability to store knowledge in a personalized KB, catering to individual user demands. With extensive experiments, we show that by integrating LLMs with KBs, KnowledGPT properly answers a broader range of questions ",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLM)在自然语言处理领域展现出惊人的影响力，但仍然存在一些问题，如完整性、及时性、准确性和适应性。最近的研究致力于将LLMs与外部知识源连接起来，但是知识库(KBs)的整合仍然鲜为人知且面临着挑战。在本文中，我们介绍了KnowledGPT，这是一个全面的框架，旨在将LLMs与各种知识库连接起来，方便知识的检索和存储。检索过程采用思维启发程序，生成用于KB的搜索语言的代码，其中预定义了KB操作的函数。除了检索外，KnowledGPT还提供了将知识存储在个性化知识库中的能力，以满足个体用户需求。通过大量实验证明，通过将LLMs与KBs集成，KnowledGPT能够正确回答更广泛范围的问题。",
