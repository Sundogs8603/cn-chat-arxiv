    "translated_abstract": "光学字符识别（OCR）可以从扫描或数字化的文本图像中自动提取文本，但也使得从这些图像中盗取有价值或敏感的文本变得容易。以往用于防止OCR盗版的方法通过扭曲文本图像中的字符，在现实场景中是不实际的，因为盗版者可以捕获文本图像的任意部分，使防御措施失效。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖而有效的防御机制，称为通用防御底纹补丁（UDUP），它修改文本图像的底纹而不是字符。UDUP是通过迭代优化过程创建的，用于制作一个小型的、固定大小的防御补丁，可以为任意大小的文本图像生成非重叠的底纹。实验结果表明，在任何截屏范围或复杂图像背景的情况下，UDUP有效地防御未经授权的OCR。它对内容、大小、颜色和语言都是无关的。",
