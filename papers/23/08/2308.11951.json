    "translated_abstract": "使用由骨架驱动的神经辐射场（NeRF）和稀疏的摄像机组可以重建动态人体运动和形状。然而，模拟衣物和皮肤的变形与骨架姿势之间的关系仍然是一个挑战。与隐式学习或依赖代理表面的现有角色模型不同，我们的方法源于观察到不同的姿势需要不同的频率分配。忽视这种区别会在平滑区域产生噪点伪影，或使锐利区域的细粒度纹理和形状细节模糊。我们开发了一个在频域中是自适应和显式的双分支神经网络。第一个分支是一个图神经网络，本地建模身体部位之间的相关性，以骨架姿势作为输入。第二个分支将这些相关特征组合到一组全局频率中，然后调节特征编码。我们的实验证明，我们的网络优于现有的状态。",
