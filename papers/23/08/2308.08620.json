    "translated_abstract": "随着社交媒体的普及，越来越多的用户在日常生活中寻找并参加群组活动。这就需要对群组识别（GI）任务进行研究，即为用户推荐群组。这个任务的主要挑战是如何基于用户以往的群组参与和用户对项目的兴趣，预测用户对群组的偏好。尽管最近图神经网络（GNNs）在基于图的推荐系统中成功嵌入多类对象，但它们无法全面解决这个GI问题。在本文中，我们提出了一个名为过渡超图卷积与图自监督学习的群组识别新框架（GTGS）。我们设计了一种新颖的过渡超图卷积层，以利用用户对项目的偏好作为先验知识，帮助寻找其对群组的偏好。为了构建综合的用户/群组表示，我们进行了自监督学习来完成GI任务。",
