    "translated_abstract": "大气对人类有多种影响，从因天气不良而丧生的损失到对社会的长期社会和经济影响。因此，对大气动力学进行计算机模拟对我们和未来的世代的福祉非常重要。在这里，我们提出了AtmoRep，一种新颖的、与任务无关的大气动力学随机计算机模型，可以为广泛的应用提供技能结果。AtmoRep利用人工智能的大规模表示学习来确定大气高度复杂、随机动力学的通用描述，该描述基于历史轨迹的最佳可用估计，这些历史轨迹受观测约束。这是通过一种新颖的自监督学习目标和一个独特的集合实现的，该集合从随机模型中采样，其可变性受历史记录中的可变性启发。AtmoRep的任务无关性使其能够为各种应用提供灵活的结果。",
