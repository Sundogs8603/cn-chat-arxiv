    "translated_abstract": "Mobilit\\\"at.Leben研究调查了德国一个自然实验对出行行为的影响。为应对2022年的生活成本危机，在2022年6月、7月和8月，引入了两项政策措施，以减少人口出行成本：燃油消费税削减和几乎免费的公共交通，称为9欧票。德国票的继任者，所谓的Deutschlandticket的公告，导致立即决定继续研究。Mobilit\\\"at.Leben研究有两个时期，9欧票时期和Deutschlandticket时期，包括几个问卷调查和基于智能手机的被动航点跟踪。整个研究持续时间共计十三个月。在本论文中，我们报告了研究设计、招募策略、调查参与情况以及跟踪部分，并分享了我们在进行大规模面板研究方面的经验。总体而言，3080人参加了这项研究。",
