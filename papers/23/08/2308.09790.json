    "abstract": "The reliability of controlled experiments, or \"A/B tests,\" can often be compromised due to the phenomenon of network interference, wherein the outcome for one unit is influenced by other units. To tackle this challenge, we propose a machine learning-based method to identify and characterize heterogeneous network interference. Our approach accounts for latent complex network structures and automates the task of \"exposure mapping'' determination, which addresses the two major limitations in the existing literature. We introduce \"causal network motifs'' and employ transparent machine learning models to establish the most suitable exposure mapping that reflects underlying network interference patterns. Our method's efficacy has been validated through simulations on two synthetic experiments and a real-world, large-scale test involving 1-2 million Instagram users, outperforming conventional methods such as design-based cluster randomization and analysis-based neighborhood exposure mapping.

    "translated_abstract": "受网络干扰现象的影响，控制实验或\"A/B测试\"的可靠性通常会受到损害。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于机器学习的方法来识别和描述异质网络干扰。我们的方法考虑了潜在的复杂网络结构，并自动化了\"曝光映射\"确定的任务，从而解决了现有文献中的两个主要限制。我们引入了\"因果网络模式\"，并采用透明的机器学习模型来建立最适合反映潜在网络干扰模式的曝光映射。我们的方法通过在两个合成实验和一个涉及100-200万Instagram用户的真实大规模测试中的模拟得到了验证，表现优于传统方法，如基于设计的集群随机化和基于分析的邻域曝光映射。",
