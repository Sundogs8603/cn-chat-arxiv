    "abstract": "Current anti-spoofing and audio deepfake detection systems use either magnitude spectrogram-based features (such as CQT or Melspectrograms) or raw audio processed through convolution or sinc-layers. Both methods have drawbacks: magnitude spectrograms discard phase information, which affects audio naturalness, and raw-feature-based models cannot use traditional explainable AI methods. This paper proposes a new approach that combines the benefits of both methods by using complex-valued neural networks to process the complex-valued, CQT frequency-domain representation of the input audio. This method retains phase information and allows for explainable AI methods. Results show that this approach outperforms previous methods on the \"In-the-Wild\" anti-spoofing dataset and enables interpretation of the results through explainable AI. Ablation studies confirm that the model has learned to use phase information to detect voice spoofing.",

    "translated_abstract": "当前的反欺诈和音频深度伪造检测系统使用基于幅度谱图的特征（如CQT或Melspectrograms）或经过卷积或sinc层处理的原始音频。这两种方法都存在缺点：幅度谱图丢失相位信息，影响音频的自然性，而基于原始特征的模型无法使用传统的可解释性AI方法。本文提出了一种新方法，通过使用复数值神经网络处理输入音频的复数值CQT频域表示，结合了两种方法的优点。这种方法保留了相位信息，并允许使用可解释性AI方法。结果表明，这种方法在“In-the-Wild”反欺诈数据集上优于先前的方法，并且通过可解释性AI可以解释结果。消融研究证实了该模型已经学会了使用相位信息来检测声音伪造。",
