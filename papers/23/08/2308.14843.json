    "translated_abstract": "使用机器学习的人类活动识别在检测建筑工人的活动方面表现出巨大的潜力。活动识别在人机交互研究中有许多应用，可以使机器人理解人类同事的活动。然而，许多现有的活动识别方法缺乏鲁棒性、泛化性和适应性。本文提出了一种迁移学习方法，用于建筑工人的活动识别，该方法在相当或更好的分类准确性下，需要比之前更少的数据和计算时间。该算法通过从原作者预训练的模型中转移特征，并对其进行精细调整以进行建筑活动识别的任务。该模型在Kinetics-400上进行了预训练，Kinetics-400是一个大规模的基于视频的人类活动识别数据集，包含400个不同的类别。该模型经过微调，并使用从YouTube上捕获的手动材料处理活动的视频进行了测试。",
