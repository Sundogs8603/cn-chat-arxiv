    "translated_abstract": "糖尿病是一种常见的慢性疾病，在全球范围内影响着数百万人的健康。需要无创方法来预防和控制糖尿病，但大多数用于测量血糖水平的设备是有创的，不适合连续监测。在这里，我们提出了一种基于非侵入性光学光电脉搏图（PPG）的方法来检测糖尿病，以克服这些缺点。我们使用PPG信号和元数据对非糖尿病和糖尿病患者进行分类，用于训练逻辑回归（LR）和极限梯度提升（XGBoost）算法。我们使用了一个公开可用的数据集中的PPG信号。为了防止过拟合，我们将数据分成五个部分进行交叉验证。通过确保训练集中的患者不在测试集中，可以在未见过的受试者的数据上评估模型的性能，提供更准确的评估其泛化能力。我们的模型在F1-Score和AUC上分别达到了$58.8\\pm20.0\\%$和$7",
