    "translated_abstract": "在合作框架下的网络游戏中，位置值是一种基于链接的分配规则。它是从一个相关的合作博弈的Shapley值中获得的，其中网络的链接被看作是玩家。然后将每个链接的Shapley值平均分配给形成这些链接的玩家。基本假设是该值对网络中玩家的权重是漠不关心的。根据玩家在网络中的中心性或者与其他玩家建立链接的能力等因素，玩家可以被视为具有权重。因此，在这种情况下，将Shapley值平均分配给玩家可能是一个过于简化的概念。我们提出了一种广义版本的位置值：权重位置值，将Shapley份额按照玩家的权重比例分配。玩家的权重是外生的。我们提供了我们的值的两个公理特征化。最后，我们提供一个招标机制。",
