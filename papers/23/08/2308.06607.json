    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在一个带有替代生产技术和正外部性的简单重复博弈中，观点不同如何影响群体的生产绩效。参与者可以持有不同的观点，即对技术的特性和质量持有不同的看法。这种分歧有两个主要特点。首先，不同的观点会导致不同的技术和努力选择--“乐观”的观点会导致比“怀疑”的观点更高的努力程度。其次，观点是有韧性的--只有在出乎意料的证据证明其为错误时才会发生变化。当只有一种生产技术可用时，对其生产力的分歧(i)激励乐观主义者比与有类似观点的玩家匹配时更努力地工作；(ii)可以降低怀疑主义者的努力。第一个力量构成了我们所谓的“分歧红利”的核心。我们展示了如果外部性足够强，一个有类似观点的乐观主义者团队在预期产出方面会被一个具有分歧观点的团队在表现上超过。",

    "en_tdlr": "Through studying a simple repeated game model, we find that disagreement among individuals' views has various effects on the productive performance of a group. Different views lead to different technology and effort choices, and disagreement can incentivize optimistic individuals to work harder but may reduce the effort of skeptical individuals. When there are strong externalities, a team with divergent views can outperform a team with like-minded individuals in terms of expected output."
