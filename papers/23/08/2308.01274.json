    "translated_abstract": "尽管经验共享（ES）在顾问-受劝告框架中加速了多智能体强化学习（MARL），但尝试将ES应用于分布式多智能体系统迄今为止仍依赖于值得信赖的环境，并忽略了对抗性操纵和推理的可能性。然而，在现实世界中，一些拜占庭攻击者冒充顾问向受劝告提供虚假建议，并严重降低整体学习性能。而且，一个推理攻击者冒充受劝告者可能进行多次查询以推断顾问的私人信息，并使整个ES过程在隐私泄漏方面存在问题。为了解决和应对这些问题，我们提出了一种新的MARL框架（BRNES），它在每个学习步骤中启发式地为每个受劝告者选择一个动态邻居区域，并采用加权经验聚合技术来减少拜占庭攻击的影响。此外，为了确保代理的私人信息的安全",
