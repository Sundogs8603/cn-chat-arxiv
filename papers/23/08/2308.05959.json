    "translated_abstract": "深度学习越来越多地用于在3D点云数据上进行分类，物体检测和分割等机器视觉任务。然而，深度学习推断是计算密集型的。终端设备的有限计算能力因此需要一种编解码器，用于在网络上传输点云数据进行服务器端处理。这样的编解码器必须轻巧且能够在不牺牲准确性的情况下实现高压缩比。受此激发，我们提出了一种新颖的点云编解码器，专门用于分类任务。我们的编解码器基于PointNet，相比其他方法在速度和准确性上取得了更好的对比度-精度平衡。特别是，在ModelNet40数据集上，与非专用编解码器相比，BD比特率降低了94%。对于资源有限的终端设备，我们还提出了两种轻量级配置的编码器，其BD比特率削减率分别为93%和92%。",
