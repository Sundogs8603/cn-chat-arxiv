    "translated_abstract": "尽管常常使用成绩单和绩点等学术指标来评估学生的知识获得情况，但缺乏全面的指标来衡量他们对毕业后生活挑战的准备程度。本研究探讨了各种因素对大学生对变化和过渡的准备程度的影响，重点关注他们对职业的准备程度。该研究采用的方法涉及设计一份基于Paul J. Mayer的“平衡轮”理论的调查问卷，以捕捉学生在不同生活方面的情感，包括对教育过程的满意度和对薪资的期望。通过对来自KBTU学生调查的收集数据（n=47）进行线性回归、支持向量回归（SVR）、随机森林回归等机器学习模型的处理，随后使用这些模型和模糊集构建了一个智能系统。该系统能够评估毕业生对未来职业的准备程度",
