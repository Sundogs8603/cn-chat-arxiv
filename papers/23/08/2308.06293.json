    "translated_abstract": "神经网络已经在图像分类中变得无处不在，但它们的标准形式只能产生点估计，没有置信度的度量。贝叶斯神经网络通过后验分布提供神经网络预测和估计的不确定性量化。随着神经网络在更高风险的应用中的应用，不确定性量化变得越来越重要。贝叶斯神经网络通过提供准确的预测和估计，以及一个包含在期望概率内合理值的区间，解决了这个问题。尽管具有积极的特点，但贝叶斯神经网络训练起来非常困难而且耗时。传统的贝叶斯方法使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛(MCMC)，但这通常被视为太慢。最常见的方法是变分推断(VI)，因为它可以进行快速计算，但它的有效性存在多个问题。我们在高光谱目标检测的背景下应用和比较了MCMC和VI训练的贝叶斯神经网络。",
