Researchers have proposed various normalization functions, and each of them has both advantages and disadvantages. In response, efforts have been made to design a unified normalization function that combines all normalization procedures and mitigates their weaknesses. We also proposed a new normalization function called Adaptive Fusion Normalization. Through experiments, we demonstrate AFN outperforms the previous normalization techniques in domain generalization and image classification tasks.",
