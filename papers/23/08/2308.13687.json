    "translated_abstract": "人工智能的出现使得材料在各种应用中得到了全面的探索。然而，人工智能模型往往优先选择在科学文献中经常遇到的材料，从而限制了基于物理和化学特性选择适当候选材料的范围。为了解决这个不平衡问题，我们基于OQMD、Materials Project、JARVIS、COD和AFLOW2数据库生成了一个由1494017个自然语言-材料段落组成的数据集，其中占主导地位的是从头计算，并在周期表上的分布更加均匀。生成的文本叙述随后由人类专家和ChatGPT-4进行投票和评分，评分标准包括技术准确性、语言和结构、内容的相关性和深度，结果显示两者得分相似，但人类评分中的内容深度相对较低。多模态数据源和大型语言模型的合并具有巨大的潜力。",
