    "translated_abstract": "对于基于机器学习的罕见疾病（如儿童脑肿瘤）的预后和诊断，需要收集来自可能使用不同设备和协议的多个临床地点的医学成像数据。基于深度学习的放射学图像协调依赖于生成对抗网络（GANs）。然而，GANs会生成原始训练数据中不存在的伪结构，这种现象被称为“幻觉”。为了防止医学成像（如脑部的磁共振图像）中的幻觉，我们提出了一种单次学习方法，其中我们利用神经风格迁移进行协调。在测试时间，该方法使用临床地点的一张图像生成与协作地点的强度比例匹配的图像。我们的方法结合了学习特征提取器、神经风格迁移和自适应实例归一化。我们进一步提出了一种评估图像协调效果的新策略。",
