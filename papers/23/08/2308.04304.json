    "translated_abstract": "近年来，由于其通信效率的优势，语义通信一直是一个热门研究课题。由于语义通信依赖于深度学习从原始消息中提取含义，因此它容易受到针对深度学习模型的攻击。本文介绍了一种模型反演窃听攻击（MIEA），以揭示语义通信系统中隐私泄露的风险。在MIEA中，攻击者首先窃听语义通信系统传输的信号，然后进行模型反演攻击以重构原始消息，同时考虑了白盒和黑盒设置。评估结果表明，在不同的信道条件下，MIEA可以成功地重构出具有良好质量的原始消息。然后，我们提出了一种基于随机置换和替换的防御方法，以抵御MIEA，实现安全的语义通信。我们的实验结果证明了该方法的有效性。",
