We present and evaluate the performance of our chatbots using both machine-based metrics and human-based questionnaires. Overall, our rule-based model achieves the best performance, with outputs that are close to ground truth reference and contain the highest levels of empathy. Human users prefer the rule-based chatbot over the generative chatbot for its context-specific and human-like replies. Our generative chatbot also produced empathetic responses and was described by human users as engaging. However, limitations in the training dataset often result in confusing or nonsensical responses. We conclude by discussing practical benefits of rule-based vs. generative models fo",

    "translated_abstract": "与产后支持国际（PSI）非盈利组织合作，该组织致力于为产后护理人员提供情绪和焦虑障碍的支持，我们开发了三个聊天机器人，以提供上下文特定的共情支持。我们利用基于规则和生成模型，对我们的聊天机器人的性能进行了评估，并使用机器测量和人类问卷。总体上，我们的基于规则的模型表现最好，输出接近地面真值参考，并且含有最高水平的共情。人类用户更喜欢基于规则的聊天机器人，因为它具有上下文特定的、人类化的回复。我们的生成模型也能产生共情回复，并被人类用户描述为有吸引力。然而，训练数据集的限制常常导致回复混淆或无意义。我们通过讨论基于规则和生成模型的实际好处作出结论。",
