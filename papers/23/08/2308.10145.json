    "translated_abstract": "生成给定特定标签的样本需要估计条件分布。我们推导出条件分布之间Wasserstein距离的可处理的上界，以建立学习条件分布的理论基础。基于这一结果，我们提出了一种新颖的条件生成算法，其中条件分布完全由由统计距离定义的度量空间来表征。我们利用最优输运理论来提出了Wasserstein几何生成器，一种学习Wasserstein几何的新的条件生成器。所提出的方法学习观察域的条件分布和它们之间的最优输运映射。给定两个观察域标签，未观察到的中间域的条件分布位于给定的条件分布之间的Wasserstein几何中。在以光照条件为域标签的人脸图像上的实验证明了所提出方法的有效性。",
