    "translated_abstract": "表征矫正是指从自然电影中连续采集的帧的视觉特征表征曲率的减少。先前的研究已经确定了灵长类动物的初级视觉皮层（V1）的表征矫正和人类行为中的感知矫正作为生物视觉的标志，而人工前馈神经网络并未表现出这种现象，因为它们没有明确优化以产生时间可预测的电影表征。在这里，我们展示了输入图像的噪声鲁棒性可以在前馈神经网络中产生表征矫正。对抗训练（AT）和Random Smoothing（RS）的基础分类器都可以产生明显矫正的特征编码。在自然电影领域展示了它们的实用性，这些编码可以通过特征空间的线性插值来反推中间电影帧，即使它们没有在这些帧上进行训练。",
    "tldr": "本文研究在强大的前馈神经网络中，通过对输入图像的噪声鲁棒性进行训练，实现了对自然电影进行表征矫正。这种矫正在生物视觉中是常见的，但人工神经网络通常未能呈现这种现象。通过线性插值，这种矫正可以用于生成中间电影帧。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the achievement of representational straightening in robust feedforward neural networks by training them with noise-robust input images. This phenomenon, commonly observed in biological vision, is not typically demonstrated in artificial neural networks. The straightened feature codes can be used to generate intervening movie frames through linear interpolation."
