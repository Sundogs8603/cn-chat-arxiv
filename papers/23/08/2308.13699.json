    "translated_abstract": "在社交媒体上进行的大量研究比较了来自不同政党的用户的行为。作为基本步骤，他们使用预测模型来推断他们的政治派别。这个模型的准确性可以显著改变下游分析的结论，然而在不同模型之间的选择似乎是任意的。在本文中，我们提供了对当前党派预测做法的综合调查和实证比较，并提出了几种新的方法，这些方法与最先进的方法相竞争或超越之，然而却需要更少的计算资源。党派预测模型依赖于用户生成的内容（例如推文文本），他们的关系（例如他们关注谁），或者他们的活动和互动（例如他们喜欢哪些推文）。我们检查了所有这些，并比较了它们在党派预测任务中的信号强度。本文让从业者可以从多种数据类型中进行选择，而这些数据类型都是---",
