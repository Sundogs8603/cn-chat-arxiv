    "translated_abstract": "我们使用自然语言处理技术分析了十亿个词汇，以研究微博这一中国最大的社交媒体平台上的文化差异。我们将中国文化差异的两种常见解释（经济发展和城乡差异）与稻米与小麦种植的历史遗留影响进行了比较。稻农需要协调共享的灌溉网络并交换劳动力，以应对较高的劳动力需求。相反，小麦依赖降雨，所需劳动力只有稻米的一半。我们测试了这种历史遗留是否使得中国南方更加相互依赖。在所有词汇类别中，稻米解释的方差是经济发展和城市化的两倍。稻米种植区使用更多反映紧密社会联系、整体思维和谨慎、预防导向的词汇。然后，我们使用推特数据对日本的各个州进行了比较，结果基本上复制了中国的研究结果。这为稻米理论提供了关键证据。",
