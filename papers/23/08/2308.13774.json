    "translated_abstract": "多视图异构数据的哈希表示学习是提高多媒体检索准确性的关键。然而，现有方法仅利用局部相似性，未能深度融合多视图特征，导致检索准确性较低。现有方法只使用局部相似性来训练模型，忽视了全局相似性。此外，最近的工作大多通过加权和或串联来融合多视图特征。我们认为这些融合方法不足以捕捉各种视图之间的交互。我们提出了一种新颖的中心相似性多视图哈希方法（CSMVH）来解决上述问题。中心相似性学习用于解决局部相似性问题，可以利用哈希中心与样本之间的全局相似性。我们提供了丰富的实验证据，证明基于门控融合方法优于传统方法。在MS COCO和NUS-WIDE数据集上，我们的CSMVH方法取得了优越的性能。",
