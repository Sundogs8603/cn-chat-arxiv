    "translated_abstract": "神经排名模型的一个优势是它们在同义词情况下具有很好的泛化能力，即当两个单词具有相似或相同的含义时。本研究调查并量化了各种排名模型在一个明确的同义词情况下的表现：当单词仅因区域拼写习惯的差异而以不同的形式表达时（例如color vs colour）。我们首先探索了用于神经检索方法的预训练、训练和评估的数据集中美式英语和英式英语拼写惯例的普遍性，并发现美式拼写惯例要远远多于英式拼写习惯。尽管训练数据存在这些偏差，我们发现检索模型在这种同义词情况下通常具有良好的泛化能力。我们研究了在检索中对文档拼写进行规范化的影响，并观察到所有模型都受到文档拼写规范化的影响。尽管在规范化的情况下它们都经历了性能下降。",
