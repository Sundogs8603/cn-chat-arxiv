In Cyprus, as elsewhere, illegal ``fly-tipping\" is a significant issue, especially in rural areas where few legal garbage disposal options exist. However, there is a lack of studies that attempt to measure the scale of this problem, and few resources available to address it. A method of automating the process of identifying garbage dumps would help counter this and provide information to the relevant authorities. The aim of this study was to investigate the degree to which artificial intelligence techniques, together with satellite imagery, can be used to identify illegal garbage dumps in the rural areas of Cyprus. This involved collecting a novel dataset of images that could be categorised as either containing, or not containing, garbage. The collection of such datasets in sufficient raw quantities is time consuming and costly. Therefore a relatively modest baseline set of images was collected, then data augment",

    "translated_abstract": "垃圾处理是发达国家面临的一个挑战性问题。在塞浦路斯，非法的“乱倒垃圾”也是一个重要问题，特别是在农村地区几乎没有合法的垃圾处理选项。然而，目前缺乏对这一问题规模的研究，也没有足够资源来解决它。本研究旨在调查人工智能技术和卫星图像结合使用，能否用于识别塞浦路斯农村地区的非法垃圾倾倒场所。为此，我们收集了一组新颖的图像数据集，将其分为包含垃圾和不包含垃圾两个类别。由于收集这种数据集的原始数量耗时且成本高昂，因此我们先收集了一组相对较小的基准图像数据集，然后应用数据增强方法扩充数据。",
