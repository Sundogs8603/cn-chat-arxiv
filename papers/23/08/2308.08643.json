    "translated_abstract": "本文针对联邦学习中模型异构的实际且具有挑战性的问题进行了研究，其中客户端具有不同网络结构的模型。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个名为pFedHR的新框架，利用异构模型重组实现个性化联邦学习。具体而言，我们将异构模型个性化问题视为服务器端的模型匹配优化任务。此外，pFedHR能够自动且动态地生成具有最小人工干预的信息丰富且多样化的个性化候选模型。此外，我们提出的异构模型重组技术在一定程度上减轻了使用具有不同分布的公共数据与客户端数据造成的不良影响。实验结果表明，在IID和非IID设置下，pFedHR在三个数据集上的性能优于基准方法。此外，pFedHR有效降低了使用不兼容数据的不良影响。",
