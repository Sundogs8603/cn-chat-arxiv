We find little support for either: only 30 percent of the choices are consistent with a concave utility, only two out of 72 subjects are consistent with expected utility, and only one of them fits the economic model of risk aversion. Our findings contrast with the preponderance of seemingly \"risk-averse\" choices that have been elicited using the popular multiple-price list methodology, a result we replicate in this paper.

    "translated_abstract": "在经济学中，通过期望效用范式内的凹凸伯努利效用来建模风险规避。我们提出了一种简单的期望效用和凹凸性的测试方法。我们发现很少支持任何一种模型：只有30%的选择符合凹凸效用，只有72名受试者中的两人符合期望效用，而其中只有一人符合经济学中的风险规避模型。我们的结果与使用流行的多价格清单方法获取的看似“风险规避”的选择的普遍现象形成对比，这一结果我们在本文中重复了。我们证明了这种方法不适用于衡量风险规避，并且它产生风险规避高普遍性的原因是参数错误。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一种检验期望效用和凹凸性的简单方法，结果发现几乎没有支持这两个模型。此外，研究还证明使用流行的多价格清单方法测量风险规避是不合适的，由于参数错误导致了风险规避高普遍性的现象。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes a simple test to examine expected utility and concavity, and finds little support for both models. Additionally, it demonstrates that using the popular multiple-price list methodology to measure risk aversion is inappropriate, as the high prevalence of risk aversion is due to parametric misspecification."
