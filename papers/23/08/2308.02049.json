    "abstract": "This paper investigates the optimal selection of portfolios for power utility maximizing investors in a financial market where stock returns depend on a hidden Gaussian mean reverting drift process. Information on the drift is obtained from returns and expert opinions in the form of noisy signals about the current state of the drift arriving randomly over time. The arrival dates are modeled as the jump times of a homogeneous Poisson process. Applying Kalman filter techniques we derive estimates of the hidden drift which are described by the conditional mean and covariance of the drift given the observations. The utility maximization problem is solved with dynamic programming methods. We derive the associated dynamic programming equation and study regularization arguments for a rigorous mathematical justification.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在一个金融市场中，股票回报依赖于一个隐藏的高斯均值回归漂移过程的情况下，功用最大化投资者的组合选择问题。漂移的信息是通过回报和专家意见的噪声信号获得的，这些信号随机地随时间到达。到达日期被建模为一个齐次泊松过程的跳跃时间。应用卡尔曼滤波技术，我们计算出了关于观测值的条件均值和协方差的隐藏漂移的估计值。利用动态规划方法解决了功用最大化问题。我们推导出了相关的动态规划方程，并对严谨的数学证明进行了正则化论证。",
