    "translated_abstract": "最近，先进驾驶辅助系统解决方案（ADAS）的科学进展在提高驾驶的整体安全性方面起到了关键作用。ADAS技术使得能够主动控制车辆以预防潜在的危险情况。研究人员关注的一个重要方面是驾驶员注意力水平的分析，因为最近的报告证实了由疲劳或缺乏注意力导致的事故数量的增加。为了解决这个问题，各种研究建议监测驾驶员的生理状态，因为自主神经系统（ANS）与注意力水平之间存在着很好的联系。对于我们的研究，我们设计了一种创新的生物传感器，包括近红外LED发射器和光电传感器，特别是硅光倍增器装置。这使我们能够通过分析相关的光电容积图（PPG）信号来评估驾驶员的生理状态。",
