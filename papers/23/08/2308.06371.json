The OAC scheme relies on an encoder exploiting the representation of a number in a balanced number system and computes the sum of the updates for the federated k-means via signal superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels non-coherently to eliminate the need for precise phase and time synchronization. Also, a reinitialization method for ineffectively used centroids is proposed to improve the performance of the proposed method for heterogeneous data distribution.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种无线联合k均值聚类算法的空中计算方案，以降低在无线网络上实施时的每轮通信延迟。该空中计算方案依赖于编码器利用平衡进制中数字的表示方式，并通过无线多址信道的信号叠加性质非相干地计算联合k均值的更新之和，消除了对精确相位和时间同步的需求。此外，还提出了一种重新初始化方法来改善对异构数据分布的未有效使用的质心的性能。针对客户位置聚类场景，我们展示了所提算法的性能，并与标准k均值聚类进行了比较。结果表明，所提方法在降低通信延迟的同时，与标准k均值聚类具有相似的性能。",
