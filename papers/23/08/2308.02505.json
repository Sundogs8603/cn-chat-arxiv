    "translated_abstract": "在生物医学图像分析中，数据不平衡在多种成像模态中很常见。数据增强是解决这个问题的关键之一。生成对抗网络（GANs）越来越多地被用于数据增强任务。生物医学图像特征对于评估合成图像的功效非常敏感。当评估不同生物医学成像模态下的合成图像时，这些特征可能对度量分数产生显著影响。可以通过比较真实图像的多样性和质量来评估合成图像。多尺度结构相似性指数测量和余弦距离被用于评估类内多样性，而Frechet Inception距离用于评估合成图像的质量。评估生物医学和非生物医学成像的这些度量对于研究评估合成图像的多样性和质量的知情策略非常重要。在这项工作中，我们使用一种实证方法来评估生物医学和非生物医学图像的类内多样性和质量。",
