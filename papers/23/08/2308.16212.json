    "translated_abstract": "反合成规划是化学中的一项基本挑战，旨在从市售起始材料设计反应路径到目标分子。多步反合成规划中的每一步都需要准确预测给定目标分子的可能前体分子，并给出置信度估计以指导启发式搜索算法。我们将单步反合成规划建模为离散状态空间中的分布学习问题。首先，我们引入了马尔可夫桥模型，一种生成框架，旨在近似两个难以处理的离散分布之间的依赖关系，通过有限样本的耦合数据点进行访问。我们的框架基于马尔可夫桥的概念，即以其端点为初始点固定的马尔可夫过程。与基于扩散的方法不同，我们的马尔可夫桥模型不需要作为采样代理的可追踪噪声分布，并直接使用输入产物分子作为来自难以处理的先验分布的样本进行操作。",
