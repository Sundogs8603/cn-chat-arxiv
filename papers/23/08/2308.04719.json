    "abstract": "This paper presents an empirical exploration of non-transitivity in perfect-information games, specifically focusing on Xiangqi, a traditional Chinese board game comparable in game-tree complexity to chess and shogi. By analyzing over 10,000 records of human Xiangqi play, we highlight the existence of both transitive and non-transitive elements within the game's strategic structure. To address non-transitivity, we introduce the JiangJun algorithm, an innovative combination of Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) designed to approximate a Nash equilibrium. We evaluate the algorithm empirically using a WeChat mini program and achieve a Master level with a 99.41\\% win rate against human players. The algorithm's effectiveness in overcoming non-transitivity is confirmed by a plethora of metrics, such as relative population performance and visualization results.

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过对象棋等完全信息游戏中的非传递性进行经验性探索，分析了超过10,000个人类象棋对局记录，发现了游戏战略结构中存在传递性和非传递性元素。为了解决非传递性问题，我们引入了江俊算法，这是蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）和策略空间响应神谕（PSRO）的创新组合，旨在逼近纳什均衡。我们使用微信小程序对算法进行了实证评估，并在与人类玩家对战中达到了大师级别，胜率达到99.41％。大量指标，如相对人口表现和可视化结果，证实了该算法克服非传递性问题的有效性。我们的项目网站可在\\url{https://sites.google.com/view/jiangjun-site/}访问。",
