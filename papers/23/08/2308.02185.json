It was successfully applied in computer vision and natural language processing. In the current work, we explore the effects of various unsupervised domain adaptation techniques between two text classification tasks: fake and hyperpartisan news detection. We investigate the knowledge transfer from fake to hyperpartisan news detection without involving target labels during training. Thus, we evaluate UDA, cluster alignment with a teacher, and cross-domain contrastive learning. Extensive experiments show that these techniques improve performance, while including data augmentation further enhances the results. In addition, we combine clustering and topic modeling algorithms with UDA, resulting in improved performances compared to the initial UDA setup.",

    "translated_abstract": "无监督的领域适应（UDA）是一种流行的技术，旨在减少两个数据分布之间的领域漂移。它在计算机视觉和自然语言处理领域得到了成功的应用。在本研究中，我们探索了在两个文本分类任务之间应用各种无监督领域适应技术（虚假新闻检测和偏执新闻检测）的效果。我们研究了在训练过程中不涉及目标标签的虚假新闻到偏执新闻检测的知识传递。因此，我们评估了UDA、带有教师的聚类对齐和跨领域对比学习。大量实验证明了这些技术提高了性能，而包括数据增强进一步提升了结果。此外，我们将聚类和主题建模算法与UDA相结合，结果比初始的UDA设置更好。",
