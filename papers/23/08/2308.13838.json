    "translated_abstract": "在传统的联合学习中，参数服务器和多个分布式客户端可以形成典型的买方市场，其中PS/买家数量远远少于客户端/卖家数量。为了改善联合学习的性能并减少激励客户参与联合学习的成本，本文提出了对不同客户提供的服务进行定价差异化，而不是简单地为不同客户提供相同的服务定价。价格差异化基于对联合学习带来的性能改进和计算通信能力的异质性。为此，本文提出了一个价格差异化游戏（PDG），全面解决了联合学习中的分布式资源管理问题，包括多目标权衡、客户端选择和激励机制。由于PDG是一个混合整数非线性规划（MINLP）问题，本文提出了一个具有低计算成本的分布式半启发式算法来解决该问题。",
