    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶（AD）未来的发展依赖于强大、公平和可解释的人工智能方法。根据要求，自动驾驶车辆必须能够向驾驶员和车上乘客、行人以及其他容易受伤的道路使用者解释其决策，可能还要向外部审计人员解释事故情况。然而，目前大多数可解释方法仍依赖于对多个传感器捕捉的AD场景表示进行定量分析。本文提出了一种新的AD场景表示方法，称为定性可解释图（QXG），专用于长期场景的定性时空推理。该图的构建利用了最近的定性约束获取范式。我们在NuScenes，一个开放的真实多模态数据集上的实验结果显示，一个由40帧组成的AD场景的定性可解释图可以实时计算，并且占用空间较少，具有很高的实用性。",
