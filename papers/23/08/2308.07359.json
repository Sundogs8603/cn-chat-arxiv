    "translated_abstract": "在精准医学中，寻找相似的患者是常见的目标，有助于治疗结果评估和临床决策支持。选择广泛可用的患者特征和适当的数学方法来计算相似度是至关重要的。国际疾病和相关健康问题统计分类（ICD）码被全球范围内用于编码疾病，并且几乎适用于所有患者。将其聚合为包含主要和次要诊断的集合，它们可以显示出一定程度的合并疾病并揭示合并疾病模式。可以使用语义相似度算法根据患者的ICD码计算相似度。这些算法通常使用单术语专家评分的数据集进行评估。然而，实际患者数据往往显示出不同程度的记录合并疾病，可能会影响算法的性能。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个考虑记录合并疾病的比例项。",
