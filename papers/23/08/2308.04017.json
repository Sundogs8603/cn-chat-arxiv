To address this challenge, we present the Multi-Granularity Attention Model (MGAM), a novel approach that utilizes multiple levels of granularity (i.e., subsets, groups, and supersets) to uncover group members' latent preferences and mitigate recommendation noise.

    "translated_abstract": "群组推荐是基于共同兴趣、偏好和特征为一组用户提供个性化推荐的方法。目前的研究已经探索了不同的方法，用于整合个人偏好并做出有利于整个群组的集体决策。然而，大部分方法过于依赖行为丰富的用户，忽视了行为相对稀疏的用户的潜在偏好，导致个人兴趣的学习不足。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了多粒度注意力模型（MGAM），这是一种利用多个粒度层次（即子集、群组和超集）来揭示群组成员潜在偏好和减少推荐噪声的新方法。特别地，我们提出了一个子集偏好提取模块，通过整合用户与物品的交互信息和使用层次化机制，增强了用户潜在的子集级别偏好的表示。",
