    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类价值观和意图的对齐承诺涉及使用人工智能或人类反馈。稠密的反馈注释获取和整合成本较高，而稀疏的反馈则涉及结构性设计选择，即评分（例如，在1-7的范围内对回答A进行评分）和排名（例如，回答A是否比回答B更好？）。在这项工作中，我们分析了这种设计选择对LLMs的对齐和评估的影响。我们发现，评分和排名所推断出的偏好在人类和AI注释者中都存在严重的不一致问题，达到了60%。我们的后续分析确定了解释这个现象的各种注释者偏见方面，比如人类注释者更喜欢密集回答并在两个选项之间更青睐准确性。令我们惊讶的是，我们还观察到反馈协议的选择对对齐的LLMs的评估也有显著影响。特别是，我们发现LLMs的评估结果因为反馈协议的选择而有所不同。",
    "tldr": "本研究分析了对于对齐和评估大型语言模型而言，设计反馈选择是评分还是排名对结果的影响。研究发现评分和排名所推断出的偏好存在不一致问题，并且注释者的偏见也会影响结果。同时，研究还发现反馈协议的选择也对评估结果有显著影响。",

Annotator biases and the choice of feedback protocol are found to significantly affect the evaluation results."
