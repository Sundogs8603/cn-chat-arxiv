Taking the Brazilian case as an application, we consider different disaggregation levels for inflation and employ a range of traditional time series techniques as well as linear and nonlinear machine learning (ML) models to deal with a larger number of predictors. For many forecast horizons, the aggregation of disaggregated forecasts performs just as well survey-based expectations and models that generate forecasts using the aggregate directly. Overall, ML methods outperform traditional time series models in predictive accuracy, with outstanding performance in forecasting disaggregates.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一些预测通胀的方法的有效性，重点关注细分预测-在文献中也被称为自下而上的方法。本文以巴西为案例，考虑了不同程度的通胀细分，并采用了一系列传统的时间序列技术以及线性和非线性的机器学习模型来处理更多的预测因子。对于许多预测时间段，细分预测的聚合效果与基于调查的预期和直接使用总体进行预测的模型一样好。总体而言，机器学习方法在预测准确性上优于传统的时间序列模型，在预测细分数据方面表现出色。我们的结果强调了在通胀预测中利用数据丰富的环境中的模型的好处，包括从机器学习技术中聚合细分预测，尤其是在波动时期。",
