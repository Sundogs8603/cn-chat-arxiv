    "abstract": "Despite the purported multilingual proficiency of instruction-finetuned large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Bard, the linguistic inclusivity of these models remains insufficiently explored. Considering this constraint, we present a thorough assessment of Bard and ChatGPT (encompassing both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) regarding their machine translation proficiencies across ten varieties of Arabic. Our evaluation covers diverse Arabic varieties such as Classical Arabic (CA), Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and several country-level dialectal variants. Our analysis indicates that LLMs may encounter challenges with dialects for which minimal public datasets exist, but on average are better translators of dialects than existing commercial systems. On CA and MSA, instruction-tuned LLMs, however, trail behind commercial systems such as Google Translate. Finally, we undertake a human-centric study to scrutinize the efficacy of the relatively recent model, Bard, in following human instructio",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管像ChatGPT和Bard这样的经过指导微调的大型语言模型（LLM）被认为在多语言上有很高的能力，但这些模型的语言包容性还没有得到充分的探索。考虑到这个限制，我们对Bard和ChatGPT（包括GPT-3.5和GPT-4）在十种阿拉伯语变体的机器翻译能力进行了全面评估。我们的评估涵盖了古典阿拉伯语（CA）、现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）和几种国家方言变体等多种阿拉伯语变体。我们的分析表明，LLM在存在少量公共数据集的方言上可能会遇到挑战，但平均而言，它们比现有的商业系统更擅长翻译方言。然而，在CA和MSA方面，经过指导调整的LLM与谷歌翻译等商业系统相比仍然有所不足。最后，我们开展了一个以人为中心的研究，以审查相对较新的模型Bard在遵循人类指令方面的效果。",
