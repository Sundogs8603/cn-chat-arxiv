    "translated_abstract": "Gallice和Monzón（2019）提出了一种能够在有限数量的自私代理之间维持全面合作的自然环境。他们证明，在一个顺序公共物品博弈中，代理人缺乏对自己在序列中位置的知识，但可以观察到一些前任的行动，由于代理人有激励让潜在的继任者效仿自己的贡献，所以全面贡献会在均衡中出现。本研究旨在通过经济实验来测试这个模型的理论预测。我们进行了三个处理，变化了受试者可以观察到的过去行动信息的数量以及他们的位置意识。通过严格的结构计量分析，我们发现大约25%的受试者的行为符合理论预测。然而，我们还观察到剩余受试者中存在替代行为类型。其中大多数被归类为有条件的合作者。",
