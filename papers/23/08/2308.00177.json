    "translated_abstract": "尽管深度学习模型在文本和图像领域是最先进的，但它们在表格形式的Learning-To-Rank问题上尚未一致地胜过梯度提升决策树(GBDTs)。近期在文本和图像任务上深度学习模型取得的性能提升主要依赖于无监督预训练，这种方法利用了比有标签数据多几个数量级的无标签数据。据我们所知，无监督预训练还未应用于Learning-To-Rank问题，而该问题通常产生大量无标签数据。本研究探究了无监督预训练是否能提高LTR性能，与GBDTs和其他非预训练模型相比。通过使用简单的设计选择(包括SimCLR-Rank，这是我们针对排名问题修改的SimCLR方法)，我们产生了预训练的深度学习模型，在有大量无标签数据且有限标签数据的情况下，显著优于GBDTs(和其他非预训练模型)。",
