    "translated_abstract": "音频分类旨在识别音频信号，包括语音命令或声音事件。然而，当前的音频分类器容易受到扰动和对抗攻击的影响。此外，现实世界中的音频分类任务通常受到有限的标记数据的限制。为了填补这些差距，先前的工作在计算机视觉中通过局部竞争算法（LCA）在第一层使用了神经启发式卷积神经网络（CNNs）进行稀疏编码，即LCANets。LCANets通过监督和无监督学习的组合来学习，减少对标记样本的依赖性。受到听觉皮层也是稀疏的事实的启发，我们将LCANets扩展到音频识别任务，并引入了LCANets++，它们是CNNs，通过LCA在多层次上进行稀疏编码。我们证明LCANets++对于扰动（如背景噪声）以及黑盒和白盒攻击（如逃避和破坏）比标准CNN和LCANets更加鲁棒。",
