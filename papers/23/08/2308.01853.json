    "translated_abstract": "分布偏移是现代统计学习中的一个严重问题，因为它们可以将数据的特性从真实情况中系统地改变。我们专注于Wasserstein分布偏移，其中每个数据点可能会发生轻微扰动，而不是Huber污染模型，其中一部分观测值是异常值。我们提出并研究了超出独立扰动的偏移，探索了联合分布偏移，其中每个观测点的扰动可以协调进行。我们分析了几个重要的统计问题，包括位置估计、线性回归和非参数密度估计。在均值估计和线性回归的预测误差方差下，我们找到了精确的极小极大风险、最不利的扰动，并证明了样本均值和最小二乘估计量分别是最优的。这适用于独立和联合偏移，但最不利的扰动和极小极大风险是不同的。",
