    "abstract": "The exponential growth of social media platforms has brought about a revolution in communication and content dissemination in human society. Nevertheless, these platforms are being increasingly misused to spread toxic content, including hate speech, malicious advertising, and pornography, leading to severe negative consequences such as harm to teenagers' mental health. Despite tremendous efforts in developing and deploying textual and image content moderation methods, malicious users can evade moderation by embedding texts into images, such as screenshots of the text, usually with some interference. We find that modern content moderation software's performance against such malicious inputs remains underexplored. In this work, we propose OASIS, a metamorphic testing framework for content moderation software. OASIS employs 21 transform rules summarized from our pilot study on 5,000 real-world toxic contents collected from 4 popular social media applications, including Twitter, Instagram,",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体平台的指数增长为人类社会的沟通和内容传播带来了革命。然而，这些平台越来越多地被滥用来传播有害内容，包括仇恨言论、恶意广告和色情内容，导致严重的负面后果，如对青少年心理健康的伤害。尽管在开发和部署文本和图像内容审核方法方面已经做出了巨大努力，但恶意用户可以通过将文字嵌入图像中来规避审核，例如文字的截图，通常带有一些干扰。我们发现现代内容审核软件对此类恶意输入的性能仍然未被充分探索。在这项工作中，我们提出了OASIS，一个用于内容审核软件的变形测试框架。OASIS采用了21个转换规则，这些规则是从我们对来自4个流行社交媒体应用（包括Twitter、Instagram）收集的5000个真实有害内容的试验研究总结出来的。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了OASIS，一个用于内容审核软件的变形测试框架，以解决现代社交媒体平台上恶意内容的传播问题。"
