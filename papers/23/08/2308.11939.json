    "abstract": "Accurate demand forecasting in the retail industry is a critical determinant of financial performance and supply chain efficiency. As global markets become increasingly interconnected, businesses are turning towards advanced prediction models to gain a competitive edge. However, existing literature mostly focuses on historical sales data and ignores the vital influence of macroeconomic conditions on consumer spending behavior. In this study, we bridge this gap by enriching time series data of customer demand with macroeconomic variables, such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), and unemployment rates. Leveraging this comprehensive dataset, we develop and compare various regression and machine learning models to predict retail demand accurately.",

    "translated_abstract": "在零售行业中，准确的需求预测是财务绩效和供应链效率的重要决定因素。随着全球市场日益互联互通，企业开始采用先进的预测模型来获取竞争优势。然而，现有文献主要关注历史销售数据，忽略了宏观经济条件对消费者支出行为的重要影响。在本研究中，我们通过将客户需求的时间序列数据与消费者物价指数（CPI）、消费者信心指数（ICS）和失业率等宏观经济变量相结合，弥补了这一差距。利用这个综合数据集，我们开发并比较了各种回归和机器学习模型，以准确预测零售需求。",
