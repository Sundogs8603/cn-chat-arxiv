    "abstract": "As the basic element of graph-structured data, node has been recognized as the main object of study in graph representation learning. A single node intuitively has multiple node-centered subgraphs from the whole graph (e.g., one person in a social network has multiple social circles based on his different relationships). We study this intuition under the framework of graph contrastive learning, and propose a multiple node-centered subgraphs contrastive representation learning method to learn node representation on graphs in a self-supervised way. Specifically, we carefully design a series of node-centered regional subgraphs of the central node. Then, the mutual information between different subgraphs of the same node is maximized by contrastive loss. Experiments on various real-world datasets and different downstream tasks demonstrate that our model has achieved state-of-the-art results.",

    "translated_abstract": "作为图结构数据的基本元素，节点已被认为是图表示学习中的主要研究对象。一个单独的节点直观上具有来自整个图的多个节点中心子图（例如，一个社交网络中的一个人根据他不同的关系有多个社交圈）。我们在图对比学习框架下研究了这种直觉，并提出了一种基于多个节点中心子图的对比表示学习方法，以自我监督的方式在图上学习节点表示。具体而言，我们精心设计了一系列以中心节点为中心的区域子图。然后，通过对比损失最大化同一节点的不同子图之间的互信息。在各种真实数据集和不同下游任务上的实验证明，我们的模型取得了最先进的结果。",
