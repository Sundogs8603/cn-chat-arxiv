    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了缩放卷积神经网络（CNN），具体针对残差神经网络（ResNet），用于分析心电图（ECG）。虽然ECG信号是时间序列数据，但基于CNN的模型在ECG分析中表现出了优于其他不同架构的神经网络的能力。然而，大多数以前的ECG分析研究忽略了网络缩放优化的重要性，而这会显著提高性能。我们通过检查关键参数（包括层深度、通道数和卷积核大小）探索和证明了一种有效的ResNet缩放方法。通过广泛的实验，我们发现在ECG分类中，较浅的网络、较大的通道数和较小的卷积核尺寸可以获得更好的性能。最佳网络规模可能因目标任务而异，但我们的研究结果为获得更高效准确的模型提供了见解。",
