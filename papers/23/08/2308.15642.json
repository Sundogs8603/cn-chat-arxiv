    "translated_abstract": "我们在随机块模型（SBM）中研究了具有大聚类和小不可恢复聚类的图聚类问题。之前的方法要么不允许小于$ o（\\sqrt {n}）$大小的小聚类，要么要求最小可恢复聚类和最大不可恢复聚类之间存在大小间隔。我们提供了一个基于半定规划（SDP）的算法，它消除了这些要求，并可以确定地恢复大聚类，而不考虑其他聚类的大小。中等大小的聚类对分析提出了独特的挑战，因为它们接近恢复阈值，非常敏感于小的噪声扰动，不允许闭合形式的候选解决方案。我们开发了新颖的技术，包括leave-one-out风格的论证，即使去掉一行噪声也可能大幅改变SDP解决方案，仍然可以控制SDP解决方案与噪声向量之间的相关性。",
