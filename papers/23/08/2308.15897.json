    "abstract": "This system demonstration presents Nemo, a new logic programming engine with a focus on reliability and performance. Nemo is built for data-centric analytic computations, modelled in a fully declarative Datalog dialect. Its scalability for these tasks matches or exceeds that of leading Datalog systems. We demonstrate uses in reasoning with knowledge graphs and ontologies with 10^5 to 10^8 input facts, all on a laptop. Nemo is written in Rust and available as a free and open source tool.",
