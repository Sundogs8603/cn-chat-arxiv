    "translated_abstract": "尽管社交媒体平台在促进公开对话方面具有价值，但他们经常被利用来传播有害内容。目前用于检测这种有害内容的深度学习和自然语言处理模型过度依赖于领域特定术语，影响到了它们适应泛化仇恨言论检测的能力。这是因为它们倾向于过于狭隘地关注特定的语言信号或某些词语类别的使用。当平台缺乏高质量的标记数据用于训练时，另一个重要的挑战出现了，需要跨平台模型来适应不同的分布转化。我们的研究引入了一个跨平台仇恨言论检测模型，能够在一个平台的数据上训练并推广到多个未见平台。为了实现对不同平台的良好泛化性能，一种方法是将输入表示解缠为不变特征和平台相关特征。我们还认为学习因果关系是提供更好解缠和泛化性能的关键。",
