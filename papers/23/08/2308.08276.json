    "translated_abstract": "视觉图像对于许多多属性决策是不可或缺的。旅行行为研究中的决策情景包括居住地选择、车辆选择、旅游目的地选择和各种与安全相关的选择。然而，目前的离散选择模型无法处理图像数据，因此无法将图像中嵌入的信息纳入其对选择行为的表示中。这种离散选择模型能力与其试图模拟的现实行为之间的差距导致结果不完整且可能具有误导性。为了解决这一差距，本研究提出了“计算机视觉增强的离散选择模型”（CV-DCMs）。CV-DCMs可以通过整合计算机视觉和传统离散选择模型来处理涉及数值属性和图像的选择任务。此外，因为CV-DCMs基于随机效用最大化原则，它们保持了传统离散选择模型坚实的行为基础。",
