    "translated_abstract": "本文全面探讨了自适应Lasso和转移Lasso的理论性质。自适应Lasso是一种成熟的方法，采用根据初始估计值进行的正则化，具有渐进正态性和变量选择一致性的特点。相比之下，最近提出的转移Lasso采用根据初始估计值进行的正则化减法，具有减少非渐进估计误差的能力。一个关键问题因此出现：鉴于自适应Lasso和转移Lasso在使用初始估计值方面存在的不同方式，这种差异给每种方法带来了什么好处或弊端？本文对转移Lasso的渐进性质进行了理论研究，从而阐明了它与自适应Lasso的区别。根据这个分析的结果，我们引入了一种新的方法，将各自的优势进行了融合并补偿了他们的弱点。",
