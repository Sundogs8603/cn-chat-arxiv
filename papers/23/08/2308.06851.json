    "abstract": "Throughout the analytical revolution that has occurred in the NBA, the development of specific metrics and formulas has given teams, coaches, and players a new way to see the game. However - the question arises - how can we verify any metrics? One method would simply be eyeball approximation (trying out many different gameplans) and/or trial and error - an estimation-based and costly approach. Another approach is to try to model already existing metrics with a unique set of features using machine learning techniques. The key to this approach is that with these features that are selected, we can try to gauge the effectiveness of these features combined, rather than using individual analysis in simple metric evaluation. If we have an accurate model, it can particularly help us determine the specifics of gameplan execution. In this paper, the statistic ORTG (Offensive Rating, developed by Dean Oliver) was found to have a correlation with different NBA playtypes using both a linear regress",
