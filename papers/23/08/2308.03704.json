    "abstract": "Despite the tremendous advances achieved over the past years by deep learning techniques, the latest risk prediction models for industrial applications still rely on highly handtuned stage-wised statistical learning tools, such as gradient boosting and random forest methods. Different from images or languages, real-world financial data are high-dimensional, sparse, noisy and extremely imbalanced, which makes deep neural network models particularly challenging to train and fragile in practice. In this work, we propose DeRisk, an effective deep learning risk prediction framework for credit risk prediction on real-world financial data. DeRisk is the first deep risk prediction model that outperforms statistical learning approaches deployed in our company's production system. We also perform extensive ablation studies on our method to present the most critical factors for the empirical success of DeRisk.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管深度学习技术在过去几年取得了巨大的进展，但目前工业应用的最新风险预测模型仍依赖于高度手动调整的阶段式统计学习工具，如梯度提升和随机森林方法。与图像或语言不同，真实世界的金融数据是高维、稀疏、噪声大且极度不平衡的，这使得深度神经网络模型在训练和实践中充满挑战且易受干扰。在这项工作中，我们提出了DeRisk，一种用于真实世界金融数据信用风险预测的有效深度学习框架。DeRisk是首个超过我们公司生产系统中统计学习方法的深度风险预测模型。我们还对我们的方法进行了大量消融研究，以呈现DeRisk的经验成功的最关键因素。",
