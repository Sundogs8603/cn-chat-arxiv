    "translated_abstract": "临床试验匹配是医疗传递和发现中的关键过程。实际上，由于庞大的非结构化数据和不可扩展的手动处理，该过程存在问题。本文通过以肿瘤学为重点领域，对使用大型语言模型（LLM）扩展临床试验匹配进行了系统研究。我们的研究基于一个正在美国一个大型医疗网络进行测试部署的临床试验匹配系统。初步结果令人鼓舞：先进的LLM（如GPT-4）可以立即连接临床试验的复杂的合格条件，并提取复杂的匹配逻辑（例如嵌套的AND/OR/NOT）。虽然仍不完美，LLM在性能上显著优于以前的强基准线，并可能作为在人与人之间进行候选患者-试验划分的初步解决方案。我们的研究还揭示了一些应用LLM进行端到端临床试验匹配的重要增长领域，例如上下文限制和准确性。",
