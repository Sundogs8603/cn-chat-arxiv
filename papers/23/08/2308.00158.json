    "abstract": "Translation Quality Estimation (TQE) is an important step before deploying the output translation into usage. TQE is also critical in assessing machine translation (MT) and human translation (HT) quality without seeing the reference translations. In this work, we examine if the state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) can be fine-tuned for the TQE task and their capability. We take ChatGPT as one example and approach TQE as a binary classification task. Using English-Italian and English-German training corpus, our experimental results show that fine-tuned ChatGPT via its API can achieve a relatively high score on predicting translation quality, i.e. if the translation needs to be edited, but there is definitely space to improve the accuracy. English-Italiano bilingual Abstract is available in the paper.",

    "translated_abstract": "翻译质量估计（TQE）是将输出翻译部署到使用中之前的重要步骤。 TQE对于评估机器翻译（MT）和人工翻译（HT）的质量也是至关重要的，而不需要查看参考翻译。在这项工作中，我们检查了最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）是否可以为TQE任务和它们的能力进行Fine-Tune。我们以ChatGPT为例，将TQE视为二元分类任务。使用英意和英德训练语料库，我们的实验结果显示，通过ChatGPT的API Fine-Tuned可以在预测翻译质量方面获得相对较高的得分，即是否需要编辑翻译，但肯定有改进准确性的空间。英意双语摘要可在论文中找到。",
