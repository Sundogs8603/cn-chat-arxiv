    "abstract": "Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection has developed substantially in the past few years, with available methods approaching, and in a few cases achieving, perfect data separation on standard benchmarks. These results generally involve large or complex models, pretraining, exposure to OoD examples or extra hyperparameter tuning. Remarkably, it is possible to achieve results that can exceed many of these state-of-the-art methods with a very simple method. We demonstrate that ResNet18 trained with Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) produces state-of-the-art results out-of-the-box on near and far OoD detection benchmarks using only Euclidean distance as a scoring rule. This may obviate the need in some cases for more sophisticated methods or larger models, and at the very least provides a very strong, easy to use baseline for further experimentation and analysis.",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去几年中，OoD（Out-of-Distribution）检测取得了显著发展，现有方法在标准基准上接近甚至达到了完美的数据分离效果。这些结果通常涉及大型或复杂模型，预训练，暴露于OoD示例或额外的超参数调整。令人惊讶的是，使用一种非常简单的方法就可以超越这些最先进的方法。我们证明，使用监督对比学习（SCL）训练的ResNet18在近距离和远距离OoD检测基准上仅使用欧氏距离作为得分规则时，可以实现开箱即用的最先进结果。在某些情况下，这可能消除了对更复杂的方法或更大的模型的需求，并且至少提供了一个非常强大且易于使用的基线供进一步实验和分析使用。",
