    "translated_abstract": "在许多现实世界的场景中，智能体参与优化问题。由于大多数情况都是超约束的，最优解并不总能满足所有智能体的要求。有些智能体可能不满意，并提出类似“为什么解决方案S不满足属性P？”的问题。在本文中，我们提出了MAoE，这是一种领域无关的方法，通过（i）生成一个新的解决方案S'，该解决方案强制满足属性P，同时最小化S和S'之间的差异；以及（ii）突出显示这两个解决方案之间的差异。这样的解释旨在帮助智能体理解为什么初始解决方案优于他们的期望。我们进行了计算评估，表明MAoE可以为大型多智能体优化问题生成对比解释。我们还在四个不同的领域进行了广泛的用户研究，结果显示，在提供这些解释后，用户对解决方案的理解有所改善。",
