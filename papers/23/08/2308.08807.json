    "abstract": "The primary focus of this thesis is to make Sanskrit manuscripts more accessible to the end-users through natural language technologies. The morphological richness, compounding, free word orderliness, and low-resource nature of Sanskrit pose significant challenges for developing deep learning solutions. We identify four fundamental tasks, which are crucial for developing a robust NLP technology for Sanskrit: word segmentation, dependency parsing, compound type identification, and poetry analysis. The first task, Sanskrit Word Segmentation (SWS), is a fundamental text processing task for any other downstream applications. However, it is challenging due to the sandhi phenomenon that modifies characters at word boundaries. Similarly, the existing dependency parsing approaches struggle with morphologically rich and low-resource languages like Sanskrit. Compound type identification is also challenging for Sanskrit due to the context-sensitive semantic relation between components. All these ",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文的主要目标是通过自然语言技术使梵语手稿更加易于使用。梵语的词态丰富、复合词、自由的词序以及资源匮乏的特点给深度学习解决方案的开发带来了重大挑战。我们确定了四个基本任务，这些任务对于开发梵语的强大自然语言处理技术至关重要：梵语词分割、依赖解析、复合类型识别和诗歌分析。第一个任务，梵语词分割，是任何其他下游应用的基本文本处理任务。然而，由于在词边界处修改字符的梵语特殊现象（加入或脱落），这一任务具有挑战性。类似地，现有的依赖解析方法在形态丰富和资源匮乏的梵语等语言上遇到困难。复合类型识别对梵语也具有挑战性，因为复合词组件之间存在上下文敏感的语义关系。",
