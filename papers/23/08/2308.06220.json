    "translated_abstract": "格兰杰因果推断是从经济学到神经科学等领域广泛使用的一种有争议的方法。原始定义基于指定模型条件下建立因果关系的时间序列概念。将格兰杰因果性应用于非线性数据仍然具有挑战性，许多方法使用样本内测试，不能纳入样本外的可预测性，导致模型过拟合的担忧。为了进行样本外比较，我们明确地定义了使用协变量集的置换来表示功能连接性的度量。人工神经网络作为数据的特征提取器，用于近似任何任意的非线性关系，并在特征提取过程和模型残差的一定条件下，证明对每个置换的方差进行了一致的估计。通过模拟比较了置换方法与惩罚目标、天真替代和遗漏技术的性能",

It uses artificial neural networks for feature extraction, measures functional connectivity using permutations, and achieves consistent estimation of the variance for each permutation. The proposed method performs well compared to other techniques."
