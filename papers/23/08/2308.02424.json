    "translated_abstract": "非同质化代币（NFTs）正在兴起。它们可以代表在公司网页或在线商店上展示的艺术品——与实体艺术品类似进行市场宣传。NFT的出租是所有者的一种吸引人的 pass passive 收入形式，但也伴随着风险（例如，物品没有归还）和代管机构的费用。同样，租借人难以预测艺术品的影响，例如，NFT的观众如何感知它们。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了一种基于区块链技术的NFT租赁解决方案，采用按赞付费的定价模型，即基于以太坊链的智能合约。我们发现，区块链解决方案享有许多也适用于其他应用程序的优势，但有趣的是，我们还观察到（大型）区块链费用的负面影响。区块链解决方案对于小众艺术家似乎是不公平的，并且可能阻碍文化多样性。此外，出现了信任成本权衡以处理外部 parties 引起的欺诈行为。",
