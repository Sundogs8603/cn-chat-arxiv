    "abstract": "Morpheme glossing is a critical task in automated language documentation and can benefit other downstream applications greatly. While state-of-the-art glossing systems perform very well for languages with large amounts of existing data, it is more difficult to create useful models for low-resource languages. In this paper, we propose the use of a taxonomic loss function that exploits morphological information to make morphological glossing more performant when data is scarce. We find that while the use of this loss function does not outperform a standard loss function with regards to single-label prediction accuracy, it produces better predictions when considering the top-n predicted labels. We suggest this property makes the taxonomic loss function useful in a human-in-the-loop annotation setting.",

    "translated_abstract": "形态词义标注是自动语言文档中的关键任务，它可以极大地提高其他下游应用的效果。尽管目前最先进的标注系统在数据丰富的语言上表现非常好，但在低资源语言上创建有用的模型更加困难。在本文中，我们提出了一种利用形态信息的分类损失函数，在数据稀缺的情况下，使形态词义标注的性能更好。我们发现，尽管使用这种损失函数在单标签预测准确性方面表现不如标准损失函数，但在考虑前n个预测标签时，它产生更好的预测。我们认为这种性质使得分类损失函数在人机协作标注的环境中有用。",
