    "translated_abstract": "最近，双层优化（BLO）在信号处理和机器学习领域的一些激动人心的发展中占据了中心舞台。粗略地说，BLO是一个经典的优化问题，涉及到两个层次（即上层和下层），其中解决上层问题需要解决下层问题。BLO之所以受到欢迎，在很大程度上是因为它在建模涉及优化嵌套目标函数的SP和ML等问题方面非常强大。BLO的显著应用范围从无线系统的资源分配到对抗性机器学习。在这项工作中，我们重点研究了一类在SP和ML应用中经常出现的可解BLO问题。我们提供了这类BLO问题的一些基本概念的概述，例如它们的最优性条件、标准算法（包括它们的优化原理和实际实现方法），以及它们如何能够被利用。",
