Weak exogeneity requires the structural error to have zero conditional expectation given the present and past regressor values, allowing errors to correlate with future regressor realizations. We show that weak exogeneity in time series regressions with many controls may produce substantial biases and even render the least squares (OLS) estimator inconsistent. The bias arises in settings with many regressors because the normalized OLS design matrix remains asymptotically random and correlates with the regression error when only weak (but not strict) exogeneity holds. This bias's magnitude increases with the number of regressors and their average autocorrelation. To address this issue, we propose an innovative approach to bias correction that yields a new estimator with improved properties relative to OLS. We establish consistency and conditiona",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究具有多个解释变量的线性时间序列回归。弱外生性是时间序列分析中最常用的识别假设。弱外生性要求结构误差在给定当前和过去解释变量值的条件下具有零条件期望，允许误差与未来解释变量的实现相关。我们发现，在具有多个控制变量的时间序列回归中，弱外生性可能产生显著的偏差，甚至使最小二乘（OLS）估计不一致。在具有多个解释变量的情况下，由于规范化的OLS设计矩阵保持渐近随机，并且在仅弱外生性成立（但不是严格外生性）时与回归误差相关，因此会出现这种偏差。这种偏差大小随着解释变量数量和其平均自相关性的增加而增加。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的偏差校正方法，得到了相对于OLS具有更好性质的新估计量。我们建立了一致性和条件界定",
