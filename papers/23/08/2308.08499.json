This study aims to address these gaps by exploring the contextual representation of each device-service pair. Firstly, we propose a latent features combination technique that can capture latent feature interactions, by aggregating the device-device relationships within the SIoT. Then, we leverage Factorization Machines to model higher-order feature interactions specific to each SIoT device-service pair to accomplish accurate rating prediction.

    "translated_abstract": "社交物联网（SIoT）使智能设备相互连接并共享数据和服务，为个性化服务推荐提供了机会。然而，现有研究经常忽视了可以提高SIoT环境下推荐的准确性和相关性的关键因素。具体而言，现有技术往往只考虑了设备之间的社交关系的提取，而忽视了服务评论的上下文呈现。本研究旨在通过探索每个设备-服务对的上下文表示来填补这些缺口。首先，我们提出了一种潜在特征组合技术，可以通过聚合SIoT中的设备-设备关系来捕捉潜在特征交互。然后，我们利用因子分解机来建模每个SIoT设备-服务对特定的高阶特征交互，以实现准确的评级预测。最后，我们提出了一个基于评级预测的SIoT服务推荐框架。",
