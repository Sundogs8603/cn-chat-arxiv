    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在发展一个框架，通过适当扩展Schr\\\"odinger-Fortet-Sinkhorn模型，校准带符号的数据集，使其与指定的边际一致。具体而言，我们试图以与指定边际一致的方式修改不定符号的多维数组中的值。我们的方法遵循Schr\\\"odinger问题中的思路，旨在将“先验”概率测度更新为与边际分布一致。著名的Sinkhorn算法（由R.\\ Fortet早期建立）曾在统计学中校准列联表和最近在机器学习和最优运输中的多边际问题中得到应用。在本文中，我们假设一个以多维数组形式的不定符号先验，并提出一个优化问题来适当更新该先验，以确保与给定边际一致。所得算法给出了Sinkhorn算法的推广形式。",
