    "translated_abstract": "卷积神经网络在组织病理图像分类方面表现出色，但由于其像素级的关注，限制了可解释性。相反，新兴的图卷积网络聚焦于细胞级特征和医学意义。然而，由于浅层网络和高维像素数据使用不充分，图卷积网络在多类别组织病理图像分类中表现不佳。为了充分利用像素级和细胞级特征，我们提出了一个非对称协同训练框架，结合深度图卷积网络和卷积神经网络进行多类别组织病理图像分类。为了提高整个框架的可解释性，我们构建了一个14层的深度图卷积网络来处理细胞图数据的形态和拓扑分布。为了进一步利用像素级和细胞级信息之间的动态互作，我们还设计了一种协同训练策略来整合这两者之间的信息。",
