    "translated_abstract": "傅里叶相位恢复是一个严重病态的反问题，在各种应用中都会出现。为了保证唯一解并减少对初始化的依赖，可以利用背景信息作为结构先验。然而，在高分辨率成像时，对背景信息的需求可能是具有挑战性的。与此同时，之前提出的投影梯度下降（PGD）方法也需要大量的背景信息。本文提出了关于背景信息需求的改进理论结果，并提出了两种基于Douglas Rachford（DR）的方法。分析结果表明，在2-D信号相比于1-D信号中，为了确保唯一解所需的背景可以减少将近$1/2$。通过将结果推广到$d$-dimension，我们证明了超过信号长度$(2^{\\frac{d+1}{d}}-1)$倍的背景信息足以确保唯一解。",
