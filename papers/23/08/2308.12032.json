    "translated_abstract": "在大型语言模型领域，指令数据的质量和数量之间的平衡已成为一个焦点。鉴于此，我们引入了一种自我引导的方法，让LLM能够自主地识别和选择大规模开源数据集中的精选样本，有效减少了指令调优的手动筛选和潜在成本。我们的关键创新是指令遵循难度（IFD）指标，它成为了一个决定性工具，用于识别模型期望响应和自主生成能力之间的差异。通过灵活应用IFD，我们能够找到精选样本，从而大幅提升模型训练效率。在Alpaca和WizardLM等知名数据集上的实证验证支持我们的发现；仅使用传统数据输入的10%，我们的策略展示了改进的结果。这种自我引导挑选和IFD指标的综合意味着LLM优化的一个变革性飞跃，有望同时提高模型性能和降低成本。",
