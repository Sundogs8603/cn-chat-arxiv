    "abstract": "Terrorism has become a worldwide plague with severe consequences for the development of nations. Besides killing innocent people daily and preventing educational activities from taking place, terrorism is also hindering economic growth. Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) can contribute to fighting terrorism by predicting in real-time future terrorist attacks if accurate data is available. This paper is part of a research project that uses text from social networks to extract necessary information to build an adequate dataset for terrorist attack prediction. We collected a set of 3000 social network texts about terrorism in Burkina Faso and used a subset to experiment with existing NLP solutions. The experiment reveals that existing solutions have poor accuracy for location recognition, which our solution resolves. We will extend the solution to extract dates and action information to achieve the project's goal.",

    "translated_abstract": "恐怖主义已经成为全球性的灾害，给国家的发展带来了严重后果。除了每天杀害无辜人民和阻止教育活动的进行，恐怖主义还阻碍了经济的增长。机器学习（ML）和自然语言处理（NLP）可以通过预测准确的数据来实时预测未来的恐怖袭击，从而有助于打击恐怖主义。该论文是一个研究项目的一部分，该项目利用社交网络文本提取必要的信息，以构建适当的恐怖袭击预测数据集。我们收集了3000条有关布基纳法索恐怖主义的社交网络文本，并使用其中的一部分来尝试现有的NLP解决方案。实验证明，现有的解决方案对于位置识别的准确性较差，而我们的解决方案解决了这个问题。我们将扩展该解决方案以提取日期和行动信息，以实现项目的目标。",
