    "translated_abstract": "鉴于恶意软件的大量存在，为了检测恶意软件，防御者越来越多地采用自动化和机器学习技术。然而，机器学习模型容易受到对抗攻击，需要测试模型和产品的鲁棒性。同时，攻击者也试图自动化恶意软件的生成和对抗杀毒软件系统，而防御者则试图洞察他们的方法。本文提出了一种新的算法，将恶意软件逃避与模型提取（MEME）攻击相结合。MEME利用基于模型的增强学习对Windows可执行二进制样本进行对抗性修改，同时训练一个与目标模型高度一致的代理模型以进行逃避。为了评估该方法，我们将其与两种最先进的对抗性恶意软件生成攻击方法进行比较，使用三个著名的公开模型和一个杀毒软件产品作为目标。结果表明，相对于先进方法，MEME在逃避方面表现更好。",
