    "translated_abstract": "多领域推荐(MDR)旨在为具有重叠用户/物品的不同领域(例如产品类型)提供推荐，对于拥有多个服务的平台如亚马逊、Facebook和LinkedIn是常见的。现有的MDR模型面临两个挑战：首先，很难解耦可以泛化到所有领域的知识(例如，用户喜欢廉价的物品)与特定于单个领域的知识(例如，用户喜欢蓝色的服装但不喜欢蓝色的汽车)。其次，它们在具有小重叠的领域之间转移知识的能力有限。我们提出了一种名为EDDA的新的MDR方法，其中包含两个关键组成部分，即嵌入解耦推荐器和领域对齐，分别解决了这两个挑战。特别地，嵌入解耦推荐器分离了跨领域部分和单领域部分的模型和嵌入，而大多数现有的MDR方法只关注模型层面的解耦。领域对齐使用领域特定的对抗训练来提升不同领域之间的知识转移能力。",
