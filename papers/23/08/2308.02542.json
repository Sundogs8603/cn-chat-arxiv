    "translated_abstract": "将AI技术根据每个用户的偏好进行定制是其良好运行的基础。然而，当前的方法需要用户过多参与，并且未能真正捕捉到他们的真实偏好。事实上，为了避免手动设置偏好的麻烦，用户通常会接受默认设置，即使这些设置与他们的真实偏好不符。规范可以用来调节行为，确保其符合用户的偏好，但是尽管文献已经详细研究了规范，大部分提议都是从形式化的角度出发。实际上，虽然已经有一些关于构建规范以捕捉用户隐私偏好的研究，但是这些方法依赖于领域知识，在AI技术的情况下，这很难获得和维护。我们认为，在构建规范时需要一种新的视角，即利用系统中大量用户的偏好信息。受到推荐系统的启发，我们相信协同过滤可以成为构建规范的方法。",
