    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体网络欺凌对人类生活有害。随着在线社交网络的不断增长，仇恨言论的数量也在增加。这些可怕的内容可能导致抑郁和与自杀有关的行为。本文提出了一种使用合成数据进行社交媒体网络欺凌检测的可信LSTM-Autoencoder网络。我们通过生成机器翻译数据展示了一种解决数据可用性困难的前沿方法。然而，印地语和孟加拉语等几种语言由于缺乏数据集的原因，仍然缺乏足够的研究。我们使用提出的模型和传统模型（包括长短期记忆网络（LSTM），双向长短期记忆网络（BiLSTM），LSTM-Autoencoder，Word2vec，双向编码器表示转换（BERT）和生成预训练转换器2（GPT-2）模型）对印地语、孟加拉语和英语数据集进行了实验性的侵犯评论识别。我们采用了评估指标来评估模型的性能。",
