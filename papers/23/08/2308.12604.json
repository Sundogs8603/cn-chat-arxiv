    "abstract": "Automatic medical report generation (MRG) is of great research value as it has the potential to relieve radiologists from the heavy burden of report writing. Despite recent advancements, accurate MRG remains challenging due to the need for precise clinical understanding and the identification of clinical findings. Moreover, the imbalanced distribution of diseases makes the challenge even more pronounced, as rare diseases are underrepresented in training data, making their diagnostic performance unreliable. To address these challenges, we propose diagnosis-driven prompts for medical report generation (PromptMRG), a novel framework that aims to improve the diagnostic accuracy of MRG with the guidance of diagnosis-aware prompts. Specifically, PromptMRG is based on encoder-decoder architecture with an extra disease classification branch. When generating reports, the diagnostic results from the classification branch are converted into token prompts to explicitly guide the generation process",

    "translated_abstract": "自动医学报告生成(MRG)具有很大的研究价值，因为它有潜力减轻放射科医生报告撰写的负担。尽管近年来取得了一些进展，但准确的MRG仍然具有挑战性，因为需要精确的临床理解和临床结果的识别。此外，疾病的不平衡分布使这一挑战更加突出，因为在训练数据中罕见疾病的比例较少，使得它们的诊断性能不可靠。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种诊断驱动的医学报告生成方法(PromptMRG)，这是一种旨在通过诊断感知的提示来提高MRG诊断准确性的新框架。具体而言，PromptMRG基于编码器-解码器架构，有一个额外的疾病分类分支。在生成报告时，从分类分支得到的诊断结果被转化为标记提示，以明确地指导生成过程。",
