    "translated_abstract": "现有的关于对策解释和算法补救的研究主要集中在静态环境中的单个个体上：在给定一些估计模型的情况下，目标是找到满足不同需求的单个实例的有效对策解释。这些对策解释的能力处理数据和模型漂移等动态问题仍然是一个较少研究的挑战。与此相关的另一个问题是一个个体对策实施的实际影响其他个体的问题，关于这方面的研究相当少。通过这项工作，我们旨在填补这一空白。首先，我们展示现有的许多方法可以被统一描述为一个广义框架。然后，我们认为现有框架没有考虑到一个隐藏的对策成本，在研究群体层面上的内生动力学时才会显现出来。通过涉及各种最先进的对策解释方法的仿真实验...",
