    "translated_abstract": "每年都有成千上万的人遭受各种类型的颅骨伤害，需要个性化植入物，手工设计昂贵且费时。因此，一个自动化的专用系统来增加个性化颅骨重建的可用性非常有必要。自动颅骨缺损重建的问题可以被描述为形状完成任务，并使用专用深度网络来解决。目前，最常见的方法是使用体积表示法并应用于图像分割的深度网络。然而，这种方法存在一些限制，不能很好地适应高分辨率体积，并没有考虑到数据的稀疏性。在我们的工作中，我们将问题重新表述为点云完成任务。我们提出了一种迭代的基于变换器的方法，可以在任何分辨率下重建颅缺损，并在训练和推理过程中快速且资源高效。我们比较了所提出的方法。",
