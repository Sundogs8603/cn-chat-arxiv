    "translated_abstract": "近年来，变分量子算法（VQAs）在NISQ时代的量子计算机上解决优化问题方面已经成为一种有前景的方法。然而，VQAs的一个限制是它们依赖于固定结构的电路，这些电路可能无法针对特定的问题或硬件配置进行定制。解决这个问题的一种主要策略是自适应VQAs，它通过添加和删除门来动态修改电路结构，并在训练过程中优化参数。已经在文献中提出了几种基于启发式的自适应VQAs，例如电路浅度、纠缠能力和硬件兼容性，但目前仍缺乏对不同方法进行系统比较的研究。本文旨在通过分析三种自适应VQAs来填补这一空白：进化变分量子本征求解器（EVQE）、可变模型（VAns）和随机自适应-VQE（RA-VQE）。",
