    "translated_abstract": "视觉显著性是指人类从观察环境中聚焦并提取重要特征的内在机制。近年来，关于估计视觉显著性的汽车研究领域出现了明显的兴趣激增。在驾驶汽车时，驾驶员自然而然地将注意力集中在特定对象上，利用大脑驱动的显著性机制来优先考虑某些元素。在本研究中，我们提出了一种智能系统，将驾驶员的嗜睡检测系统与基于显著性的场景理解管线相结合。为了实现这一目标，我们实现了一个专门的3D深度网络用于语义分割，该网络经过预训练和定制，用于处理汽车级外部摄像头捕获的帧。所提出的管线运行在一个嵌入式平台上，采用STA1295核心，具有ARM A7双核，并嵌入了硬件加速器。",
