    "translated_abstract": "传统的几何注册估计方法仅隐式地利用CAD模型，这导致它们对观察质量的依赖性和对遮挡的不足。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一个具有点对注意力感知机制的双向对应预测网络。该网络不仅要求模型点预测对应关系，还明确地对观察和模型先验之间的几何相似性进行建模。我们的关键见解是，每个模型点和场景点之间的相关性为学习点对匹配提供了关键信息。为了进一步解决特征分布分歧带来的相关性噪声，我们设计了一个简单但有效的伪孪生网络来改善特征的一致性。在线MOD、YCB-Video和Occ-LineMOD的公共数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的方法在性能上优于其他最先进的方法。",
