    "translated_abstract": "大规模深度神经网络在复杂问题上表现出色，但也常常出现突然、意外且灾难性的失败，尤其是在具有挑战性的情况下。现有的为神经网络提供风险感知的算法复杂而临时。具体而言，这些方法需要进行重大的工程改变，通常只针对特定设置进行开发，并且很难组合在一起。我们在这里提出了capsa，一个用于扩展具有风险感知的模型的框架。Capsa提供了一种量化多种形式风险的方法，并将不同的算法组合在一起以并行量化不同的风险指标。我们通过在capsa框架中实现最先进的不确定性估计算法并在复杂感知数据集上进行基准测试，验证了capsa的有效性。我们展示了capsa轻松组合aleatoric不确定性、epistemic不确定性和偏见估计的能力",
