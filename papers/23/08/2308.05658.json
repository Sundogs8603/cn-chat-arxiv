    "translated_abstract": "在当今快速发展的城市环境中，高效准确地绘制道路基础设施对于优化交通系统、增强道路安全并改善驾驶员和通勤者的整体出行体验至关重要。然而，一个严峻的瓶颈阻碍了进展-繁琐耗时的手动交叉点识别。考虑到需要识别的交叉点数量和每个交叉点所需的工时，自动化解决方案的需求变得不可忽视。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，利用连接车辆数据和先进的深度学习技术。通过使用地理散列对车辆轨迹进行分段，并生成道路段的图像表示，我们利用YOLOv5（You Only Look Once version 5）算法准确分类了直线道路段和交叉点。实验结果展示了令人印象深刻的整体准确性。",
