    "translated_abstract": "大多数面部展示攻击检测（FacePAD）算法的致命缺点是对未见过的领域/攻击缺乏泛化能力。现有的增强FacePAD解决方案泛化能力的尝试假设可以通过单一实体收集多个源领域的数据来进行集中式训练。实际上，不同源领域的数据可能由不同的实体收集，由于法律和隐私限制，他们往往无法共享自己的数据。虽然联合学习范式（如联邦学习）可以克服这个问题，但标准的联邦学习方法不适合领域泛化，因为它们在训练过程中很难处理非独立同分布的客户端数据分布，并在推理过程中泛化到未见过的领域。本文介绍了一种新颖的框架，称为联邦式分割学习和中间表示采样（FedSIS），用于隐私保护的领域泛化。",
