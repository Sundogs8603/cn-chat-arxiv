In this paper, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first dynamic framework for neurological prognostication of post-cardiac-arrest comatose patients using EEG data: our framework makes predictions for a patient over time as more EEG data become available, and different training patients' available EEG time series could vary in length. Predictions are phrased in terms of either time-to-event outcomes (time-to-awakening or time-to-death) or as the patient's probability of awakening or of dying across multiple time horizons. Our framework uses any dynamic survival analysis model that supports competing risks in the form of estimating patient-level cumulative incidence functions. We consider three competing risks as to what happens first to a patient: awakening, bei",

    "translated_abstract": "从心搏骤停复苏进入昏迷状态的患者面临着较高的死亡风险。预测这些患者的神经学结局（神经学预后任务）可以帮助决策治疗。在本文中，我们提出了首个动态框架，使用脑电图数据对心搏骤停后昏迷患者进行神经学预后：我们的框架根据随着更多脑电图数据的获得，随时间为患者做出预测，并且不同的训练患者可用的脑电图时间序列的长度可能存在差异。预测可通过时间-事件结果（苏醒时间或死亡时间）或患者在多个时间段苏醒或死亡的概率来表述。我们的框架使用任何支持竞争风险的动态生存分析模型，以估计患者水平的累积发生函数。我们考虑患者首先出现的三种竞争风险：苏醒、死亡或发作。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一种基于脑电图数据的动态生存分析框架，用于预测心搏骤停后昏迷患者的神经学预后。该框架可以根据不同时点患者的脑电图数据进行预测，并提供苏醒或死亡的概率。这是目前已知的第一个关于这一领域的动态框架。",

The framework makes predictions based on the available EEG data at different time points and provides probabilities of awakening or death. It is the first known framework in this field."
