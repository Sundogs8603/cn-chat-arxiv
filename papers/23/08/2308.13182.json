    "translated_abstract": "随着数字扫描仪和深度学习的出现，诊断操作可能从显微镜移到桌面上。血红素和伊红染色（H&E）是最常用于疾病分析、诊断和分级的染色方法之一，但病理学家确实需要不同的免疫组织化学（IHC）染色来分析特定的结构或细胞。在单个标本上获得所有这些染色（H&E和不同的IHC）是一项繁琐耗时的任务。因此，虚拟染色已成为一个重要的研究方向。在这里，我们提出了一种新颖的生成模型，结构Cycle GAN（SC-GAN），用于从H&E图像合成IHC染色反之亦然。我们的方法明确地将边缘结构信息（除了颜色数据）纳入到所提出的生成模型的解码器中，并且在生成过程中仅使用注意力模块。这种集成增强了特征定位并在生成过程中保留了上下文信息。",
