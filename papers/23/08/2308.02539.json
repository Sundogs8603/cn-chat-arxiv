    "translated_abstract": "准确地表示信息摘要是一个需要在各种情况下执行的任务，例如数据库视图规范和生成式人工智能从结构化输入的自然语言生成流水线的第一阶段，即内容选择阶段以确定需要转述的内容。对于Abstract Wikipedia项目而言，需求分析表明，这种抽象表示需要多语言建模、覆盖声明性内容和函数的内容选择，以及类和实例。目前没有满足这三个特征之一的建模语言，更不用说一个结合了这三个特征的语言。经过广泛的相关方咨询，我们遵循严谨的语言设计过程，创建了CoSMo，一个全新的内容选择建模语言，以满足这些以及其他需求，使其在Abstract Wikipedia以及其他环境中都能有用。我们描述了设计过程、原理和选择，",
