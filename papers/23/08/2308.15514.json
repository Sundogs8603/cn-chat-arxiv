    "abstract": "This report describes trade-offs in the design of international governance arrangements for civilian artificial intelligence (AI) and presents one approach in detail. This approach represents the extension of a standards, licensing, and liability regime to the global level. We propose that states establish an International AI Organization (IAIO) to certify state jurisdictions (not firms or AI projects) for compliance with international oversight standards. States can give force to these international standards by adopting regulations prohibiting the import of goods whose supply chains embody AI from non-IAIO-certified jurisdictions. This borrows attributes from models of existing international organizations, such as the International Civilian Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). States can also adopt multilateral controls on the export of AI product inputs, such as specialized hardware, to non-certified",

    "translated_abstract": "本报告描述了国际民用人工智能（AI）治理安排设计中的权衡，并详细介绍了一种方法。该方法将一个标准、许可和责任制度扩展到全球范围。我们建议各国建立一个国际人工智能组织（IAIO）来认证国家管辖区域（而不是公司或AI项目）是否符合国际监督标准。各国可以通过采用禁止从未经IAIO认证的管辖区域进口AI供应链所包含产品的法规来实施这些国际标准。这一方法借鉴了现有国际组织模式，如国际民用航空组织（ICAO）、国际海事组织（IMO）和金融行动特别工作组（FATF）。各国还可以对非认证国家采取多边控制措施，例如对AI产品输入（如专用硬件）的出口。",
