    "translated_abstract": "历史上，描述逻辑的研究主要集中在可以翻译成可判定的一阶逻辑片段的特征上。在本文中，我们放弃了这个限制，寻找有用且可判定的一阶逻辑以外的扩展。我们引入了全称量化概念，它们以可以被任意概念替换的变量形式出现，并定义了这个扩展的两种语义。模式语义只允许概念变量被特定语言的概念替换，产生类似模态逻辑的公理模式。二阶语义允许概念变量被域的任意子集替换，类似于二阶逻辑中的量化谓词。为了研究所提出的语义，我们重点关注描述逻辑$\\mathcal{EL}$的扩展。我们证明了在扩展的有用片段中，不同语义所蕴含的结论是相同的，从而可以使用经典逻辑的推理方法。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文通过引入全称量化概念扩展了描述逻辑$\\mathcal{EL}$，分别提出了模式语义和二阶语义，研究了它们的性质并证明了它们在有用片段中的结论相同。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper extends the description logic $\\mathcal{EL}$ by introducing universally quantified concepts, and defines both schema and second-order semantics for this extension. It investigates the properties of the proposed semantics and demonstrates that they coincide in a useful fragment of the extension."
