    "translated_abstract": "节点分类是在图中预测未标记节点的标签的任务。基于图神经网络的最先进方法在训练期间所有标签都可用时可以实现出色的性能。但在现实生活中，模型通常应用于具有新类别的数据，这可能导致大规模的误分类，从而显著降低性能。因此，开放集分类方法的开发对于确定给定样本是否属于已知类别至关重要。现有的开放集节点分类方法通常使用传导学习，利用真实未见类别节点的部分或全部特征来帮助开放集分类。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的生成式开放集节点分类方法，即$\\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$，它遵循更严格的归纳学习设置，在训练和验证过程中没有未知类别的信息可用。两种类型的代理未知节点，即类间未知代理和外部未知代理，将被引入该方法中。",
