    "abstract": "We introduce CartiMorph, a framework for automated knee articular cartilage morphometrics. It takes an image as input and generates quantitative metrics for cartilage subregions, including the percentage of full-thickness cartilage loss (FCL), mean thickness, surface area, and volume. CartiMorph leverages the power of deep learning models for hierarchical image feature representation. Deep learning models were trained and validated for tissue segmentation, template construction, and template-to-image registration. We established methods for surface-normal-based cartilage thickness mapping, FCL estimation, and rule-based cartilage parcellation. Our cartilage thickness map showed less error in thin and peripheral regions. We evaluated the effectiveness of the adopted segmentation model by comparing the quantitative metrics obtained from model segmentation and those from manual segmentation. The root-mean-squared deviation of the FCL measurements was less than 8%, and strong correlations ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了CartiMorph，一种用于自动化膝关节软骨形态学测量的框架。它以图像作为输入，并生成软骨亚区域的定量指标，包括全厚度软骨丢失（FCL）的百分比、平均厚度、表面积和体积。CartiMorph利用深度学习模型进行分层图像特征表示。我们训练和验证了深度学习模型，用于组织分割、模板构建和模板到图像的注册。我们建立了基于表面法线的软骨厚度映射、FCL估计和基于规则的软骨分割方法。我们的软骨厚度图在薄和周边区域显示出较小的误差。我们通过比较通过模型分割和手动分割获得的定量指标，评估了所采用的分割模型的有效性。FCL测量的均方根偏差小于8%，并且与手动分割的指标存在强相关性。",
