    "abstract": "We introduce MyVoice, a crowdsourcing platform designed to collect Arabic speech to enhance dialectal speech technologies. This platform offers an opportunity to design large dialectal speech datasets; and makes them publicly available. MyVoice allows contributors to select city/country-level fine-grained dialect and record the displayed utterances. Users can switch roles between contributors and annotators. The platform incorporates a quality assurance system that filters out low-quality and spurious recordings before sending them for validation. During the validation phase, contributors can assess the quality of recordings, annotate them, and provide feedback which is then reviewed by administrators. Furthermore, the platform offers flexibility to admin roles to add new data or tasks beyond dialectal speech and word collection, which are displayed to contributors. Thus, enabling collaborative efforts in gathering diverse and large Arabic speech data.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了MyVoice，一个用于收集阿拉伯语语音来增强方言语音技术的众包平台。该平台提供了设计大型方言语音数据集的机会，并使其公开可用。MyVoice允许贡献者选择城市/国家级的细粒度方言，并记录显示的话语。用户可以在贡献者和注释者之间切换角色。该平台采用了质量保证系统，在发送录音进行验证之前，过滤掉低质量和虚假的录音。在验证阶段，贡献者可以评估录音的质量、注释它们，并提供反馈，然后由管理员进行审核。此外，该平台提供了灵活性，使管理员角色能够添加除方言语音和单词收集之外的新数据或任务，这些任务将显示给贡献者。从而促进收集多样化和大规模的阿拉伯语语音数据的协作努力。",
