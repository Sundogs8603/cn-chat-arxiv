    "translated_abstract": "Transformers在自然语言处理中取得了显著的成功，然而它们在动态系统中的潜力仍然大部分未被探索。本文研究了使用transformers进行最优输出估计问题，它使用过去的所有输出来生成预测。我们使用来自先验分布的各种系统来训练transformer，然后在先前未见过的相同分布的系统上评估其性能。结果表明，获得的transformer就像一个预测算法，它可以在上下文中学习并快速适应和预测不同的系统，因此我们称之为元输出预测器（MOP）。尽管MOP没有访问模型的权限，但在大多数线性动态系统中，它的性能与基于卡尔曼滤波器的最优输出估计器相当。通过大量的数值实验，我们观察到MOP在具有非独立同分布噪声和时变动态的挑战性场景中也表现优秀。",
