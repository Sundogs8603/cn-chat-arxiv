    "abstract": "Effective control of credit risk is a key link in the steady operation of commercial banks. This paper is mainly based on the customer information dataset of a foreign commercial bank in Kaggle, and we use LightGBM algorithm to build a classifier to classify customers, to help the bank judge the possibility of customer credit default. This paper mainly deals with characteristic engineering, such as missing value processing, coding, imbalanced samples, etc., which greatly improves the machine learning effect. The main innovation of this paper is to construct new feature attributes on the basis of the original dataset so that the accuracy of the classifier reaches 0.734, and the AUC reaches 0.772, which is more than many classifiers based on the same dataset. The model can provide some reference for commercial banks' credit granting, and also provide some feature processing ideas for other similar studies.",

    "translated_abstract": "有效控制信用风险是商业银行稳定运作的关键环节。本文主要基于Kaggle上一家外国商业银行的客户信息数据集，利用LightGBM算法构建分类器对客户进行分类，帮助银行判断客户信用违约的可能性。本文主要处理特征工程，如缺失值处理、编码、不平衡样本等，极大地提高了机器学习效果。本文的主要创新是在原始数据集的基础上构建新的特征属性，使分类器的准确率达到0.734，AUC达到0.772，这超过了许多基于相同数据集的分类器。该模型可以为商业银行的信贷授予提供一些参考，同时也为其他类似研究提供一些特征处理的思路。",
