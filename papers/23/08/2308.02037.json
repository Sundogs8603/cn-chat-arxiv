    "abstract": "Existing communications and behavioral theories have been adopted to address health misinformation. Although various theories and models have been used to investigate the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no framework specially designed for social listening or misinformation studies using social media data and natural language processing techniques. This study aimed to propose a novel yet theory-based conceptual framework for misinformation research. We collected theories and models used in COVID-19 related studies published in peer-reviewed journals. The theories and models ranged from health behaviors, communications, to misinformation. They are analyzed and critiqued for their components, followed by proposing a conceptual framework with a demonstration. We reviewed Health Belief Model, Theory of Planned Behavior/Reasoned Action, Communication for Behavioral Impact, Transtheoretical Model, Uses and Gratifications Theory, Social Judgment Theory, Risk Information Seeking and Processing Mode",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的传播和行为理论已经被采用来解决健康错误信息的问题。虽然已经有各种理论和模型被用于研究COVID-19大流行，但尚缺乏专门针对社交媒体数据和自然语言处理技术进行社交监听或错误信息研究的框架。本研究旨在提出一个新颖而基于理论的概念框架，用于错误信息研究。我们收集了以同行评审期刊发表的COVID-19相关研究中使用的理论和模型。这些理论和模型涉及健康行为，传播和错误信息。我们对这些理论和模型进行了分析和评述，然后提出了一个具有示范性的概念框架。我们对健康信念模型、计划行为理论/理性行为、行为影响的传播、跨理论模型、功利性理论、社会评判理论、风险信息寻求和处理模式进行了回顾。",
