    "translated_abstract": "在基于预测的神经架构搜索（NAS）中，通过图卷积网络得到的性能指标取得了显著的成功。然而，通过one-hot编码将前馈结构表示为组件图的这些指标面临一个限制：无法在不同的搜索空间中评估架构的性能。相反，手工性能指标（零样本NAS）可以在多个搜索空间中泛化，因为它们使用相同的架构和随机初始化。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一种新的深度学习方法，用于零样本NAS。我们的方法采用傅里叶正弦和求和编码来进行卷积核的编码，从而构建了一个计算的前馈图，其结构类似于正在评估的架构。这些编码是可学习的，并提供了架构拓扑信息的全面视图。然后，伴随的多层感知器（MLP）对架构进行排序。",
