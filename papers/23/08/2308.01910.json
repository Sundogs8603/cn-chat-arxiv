    "translated_abstract": "能源转型增加了对间歇性能源的依赖，不稳定了能源市场并导致了前所未有的波动性，最终导致了2021年的全球能源危机。除了对生产者和消费者造成伤害外，波动的能源市场还可能危及关键的碳减排努力。交易商通过提供流动性和减少波动性在稳定市场中扮演着重要角色。已经提出了几种数学和统计模型用于预测未来收益。然而，由于金融市场的低信噪比和非平稳动态，开发这样的模型并不是易事。本论文研究了深度强化学习方法在商品交易中的有效性。将商品交易问题形式化为连续离散时间随机动力系统。该系统采用了新颖的时间离散化方案，对市场波动做出反应并自适应，提供更好的统计特性。",
