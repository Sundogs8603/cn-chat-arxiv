    "abstract": "We explored the potential applications of various Quantum Algorithms for stock price prediction by conducting a series of experimental simulations using both Classical as well as Quantum Hardware. Firstly, we extracted various stock price indicators, such as Moving Averages (MA), Average True Range (ATR), and Aroon, to gain insights into market trends and stock price movements. Next, we employed Quantum Annealing (QA) for feature selection and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. Further, we transformed the stock price prediction task essentially into a classification problem. We trained the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) to predict price movements (whether up or down) contrasted their performance with classical models and analyzed their accuracy on a dataset formulated using Quantum Annealing and PCA individually. We focused on the stock price prediction and binary classification of stock prices for four different companies, namely Apple, Visa, Johns",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究通过进行一系列实验模拟，探索了各种量子算法在股票价格预测中的潜在应用。首先，我们提取了各种股票价格指标，如移动平均线（MA）、平均真实波幅（ATR）和阿隆指标，以了解市场趋势和股票价格走势。接下来，我们采用量子退火（QA）进行特征选择，并采用主成分分析（PCA）进行维度约简。此外，我们将股票价格预测任务转化为分类问题。我们训练了量子支持向量机（QSVM）来预测价格变动（上涨还是下跌），并将其性能与经典模型进行对比，并分析了它们在使用量子退火和PCA单独建立的数据集上的准确性。我们重点关注了四家不同公司，即苹果、威士卡、约翰斯。",
