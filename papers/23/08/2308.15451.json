    "translated_abstract": "优质的信息可以提高个体判断，但却无法使群体决策更加准确；如果个体以相同的方式选择关注相同的信息，那么赋予群体智慧以预测多样性的机会可能会丧失。决策支持系统，从商业智能软件到公共搜索引擎，通过提供决策辅助来增强决策质量和速度，包括相关信息的离散展示、解释框架或启发式方法，但这些系统也有可能通过选择性展示信息和解释框架来引入判断偏见。我们重新描述群体智慧，将其描述为常常有两个决策，即决策辅助的选择和主要决策。然后，我们将\"群体的元智慧\"定义为群体对辅助决策的集体选择方式，使群体的准确性高于以同一辅助方式随机分配的比较结果，这种比较考虑了信息内容。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the metawisdom of the crowd, which refers to how the collective choice of decision aids can enhance the accuracy of crowd wisdom. The study finds that when individuals choose to attend to different information in different ways, it increases the predictive diversity of crowd wisdom."
