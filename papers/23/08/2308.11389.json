    "abstract": "We address the problem of learning Deep Learning Radiomics (DLR) that are not redundant with Hand-Crafted Radiomics (HCR). To do so, we extract DLR features using a VAE while enforcing their independence with HCR features by minimizing their mutual information. The resulting DLR features can be combined with hand-crafted ones and leveraged by a classifier to predict early markers of cancer. We illustrate our method on four early markers of pancreatic cancer and validate it on a large independent test set. Our results highlight the value of combining non-redundant DLR and HCR features, as evidenced by an improvement in the Area Under the Curve compared to baseline methods that do not address redundancy or solely rely on HCR features.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了学习不与手工制作放射学(HCR)冗余的深度学习放射学(DLR)的问题。我们使用VAE提取DLR特征，同时通过最小化它们的互信息来确保与HCR特征的独立性。得到的DLR特征可以与手工制作的特征相结合，并通过分类器预测癌症的早期标志物。我们在四种胰腺癌早期标志物上演示了我们的方法，并在一个大型独立测试集上进行了验证。我们的结果突出了非冗余的DLR和HCR特征的价值，与不解决冗余问题或仅依赖于HCR特征的基线方法相比，曲线下面积有所改善。",

By combining the features from both approaches, the authors achieve improved prediction of early markers of pancreatic cancer compared to baseline methods."
