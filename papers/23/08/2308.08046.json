    "translated_abstract": "多臂赌博机激发了具有可证明后悔上界的方法，与之对应的后悔下界在这个背景下也被广泛研究。最近，多智能体多臂赌博机在各个领域中得到了显著的关注，其中个体客户以分布式的方式面临着赌博问题，目标是整体系统的性能，通常用后悔来衡量。尽管已经出现了具有后悔上界的高效算法，但对应的后悔下界却没有得到足够的关注，除了最近针对对抗设置的一个下界，然而，它与已知上界有差距。为此，我们在不同的设置下提供了第一次全面研究后悔下界，并建立了它们的紧密性。具体来说，当图表现出良好的连通性属性且奖励随机分布时，我们证明了一阶为$O(\\log T)$的实例相关下界和$O(\\log T)$的实例无关下界。",
