    "translated_abstract": "定量器官评估是自动化腹部疾病诊断和治疗计划的关键步骤。人工智能（AI）已经展现出自动化这一过程的巨大潜力。然而，大多数现有的AI算法依赖于许多专家注释，并且在真实世界多国设置中缺乏准确性和效率的综合评估。为了克服这些限制，我们组织了迄今为止最大规模的腹部器官分析挑战——FLARE 2022挑战，旨在评估速度快、资源少、准确、节约注释成本且具有泛化能力的AI算法。我们从50多个医疗团队构建了一个跨洲际和跨国的数据集，包括具有不同种族、疾病、阶段和制造商的计算机断层扫描（CT）。我们独立验证了一组AI算法通过使用50个标记扫描和2000个未标记扫描达到了90.0\\%的中位数Dice相似系数（DSC），这可以显著减少注释需求。",
