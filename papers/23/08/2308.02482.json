    "translated_abstract": "去误检测是一种广泛研究的领域，常用于识别语音中的停顿、重复和错误开头等语言失利现象。通过使用Switchboard语料库进行评估的标准化流程，可以轻松比较不同方法的模型性能。然而，对于学习者语音的去误检测研究而言，这样的数据集存在访问限制，使得比较和改进模型的后续开发更具挑战性。为了解决这个问题，本文描述了将包含约300小时英语学习者口语水平测试的NICT-JLE语料库适应为适用于去误检测模型训练和评估的格式的过程。研究探讨了NICT-JLE和Switchboard语料库之间的不同之处，并详细介绍了对NICT-JLE语料库的标签集和元特征的调整。这项研究的结果提供了标准化的训练、验证和测试数据集。",
