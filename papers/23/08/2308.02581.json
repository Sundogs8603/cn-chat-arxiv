    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于机器学习的方法，用于通过监控地下黑客论坛来检测野外漏洞的利用。讨论野外漏洞利用的帖子数量不断增加，需要自动处理帖子和主题，并根据其内容触发警报。为了说明所提出的系统，我们使用了CrimeBB数据集，该数据集包含从多个地下论坛抓取的数据，并开发了一个监督机器学习模型，可以过滤引用CVE的主题并将其标记为Proof-of-Concept、武器化或漏洞利用。通过利用随机森林，我们指出对于分类任务来说，可以达到准确率、精确率和召回率大于0.99。此外，我们对武器化和漏洞利用之间的性质差异提供了insights，例如解释决策树的输出，并分析了黑客社区的利润和其他相关方面。总体而言，我们提供了一个从地下黑客论坛中提取相关信息点的机器学习方法。",
