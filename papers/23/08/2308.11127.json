    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）在各种图学习任务中展示了优越的性能，包括利用图中的用户-物品协作过滤信号进行推荐。然而，尽管它们在最先进的推荐模型中的经验有效性，但对于它们的能力的理论表述非常稀少。最近的研究探讨了GNNs的一般表达能力，证明了消息传递GNNs至多与Weisfeiler-Lehman测试一样强大，并且与随机节点初始化相结合的GNNs是通用的。然而，GNNs的“表达能力”概念仍然定义模糊。大多数现有的工作采用图同构测试作为表达能力的度量标准，但这种图级任务可能不能有效评估模型在推荐中区分不同接近程度节点的能力。在本文中，我们对GNNs在推荐中的表达能力进行了全面的理论分析。",
