    "abstract": "The media localization industry usually requires a verbatim script of the final film or TV production in order to create subtitles or dubbing scripts in a foreign language. In particular, the verbatim script (i.e. as-broadcast script) must be structured into a sequence of dialogue lines each including time codes, speaker name and transcript. Current speech recognition technology alleviates the transcription step. However, state-of-the-art speaker diarization models still fall short on TV shows for two main reasons: (i) their inability to track a large number of speakers, (ii) their low accuracy in detecting frequent speaker changes. To mitigate this problem, we present a novel approach to leverage production scripts used during the shooting process, to extract pseudo-labeled data for the speaker diarization task. We propose a novel semi-supervised approach and demonstrate improvements of 51.7% relative to two unsupervised baseline models on our metrics on a 66 show test set.",

    "translated_abstract": "媒体本地化行业通常需要一个与最终电影或电视制作的原文脚本相符的脚本，以便在外语中创建字幕或配音脚本。特别是，即播出脚本必须被结构化为包含时间代码、发言人姓名和转录的对话行序列。目前的语音识别技术可以减轻转录步骤。然而，目前最先进的发言人日化模型在电视节目上仍存在两个主要问题：（一）无法追踪大量发言人，（二）在检测频繁的发言人更换时准确率较低。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了一种新方法，利用在拍摄过程中使用的制作脚本来提取用于发言人日化任务的伪标签数据。我们提出了一种新的半监督方法，并在我们的度量结果上，在66个节目的测试集上相对于两个无监督基线模型实现了51.7%的改进。",
