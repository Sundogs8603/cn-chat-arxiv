    "abstract": "Voice disorders affect millions of people worldwide. Surface electromyography-based Silent Speech Interfaces (sEMG-based SSIs) have been explored as a potential solution for decades. However, previous works were limited by small vocabularies and manually extracted features from raw data. To address these limitations, we propose a lightweight deep learning knowledge-distilled ensemble model for sEMG-based SSI (KDE-SSI). Our model can classify a 26 NATO phonetic alphabets dataset with 3900 data samples, enabling the unambiguous generation of any English word through spelling. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of KDE-SSI, achieving a test accuracy of 85.9\\%. Our findings also shed light on an end-to-end system for portable, practical equipment.",

    "translated_abstract": "语音障碍影响着全球数百万人。基于表面肌电图的静默语音界面（sEMG-based SSIs）已被研究了几十年作为潜在的解决方案。然而，以往的研究受到了词汇量有限和从原始数据中手动提取特征的限制。为了解决这些局限性，我们提出了一种轻量级的基于知识蒸馏的sEMG集成模型（KDE-SSI）。我们的模型可以对包含3900个数据样本的26个北约音标数据集进行分类，从而通过拼写方式生成任何英文单词。广泛的实验证实了KDE-SSI的有效性，实现了85.9%的测试准确率。我们的研究结果还为便携、实用设备的端到端系统提供了启示。",
