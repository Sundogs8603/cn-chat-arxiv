    "abstract": "We give novel Python and R interfaces for the (Java) Tetrad project for causal modeling, search, and estimation. The Tetrad project is a mainstay in the literature, having been under consistent development for over 30 years. Some of its algorithms are now classics, like PC and FCI; others are recent developments. It is increasingly the case, however, that researchers need to access the underlying Java code from Python or R. Existing methods for doing this are inadequate. We provide new, up-to-date methods using the JPype Python-Java interface and the Reticulate Python-R interface, directly solving these issues. With the addition of some simple tools and the provision of working examples for both Python and R, using JPype and Reticulate to interface Python and R with Tetrad is straightforward and intuitive.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们为Tetrad项目提供了新颖的Python和R接口，用于因果建模、搜索和估计（使用Java编写）。Tetrad项目已经在文献中扎根30多年，它的一些算法已经成为经典，如PC和FCI，而其他算法则是最近的发展。然而，越来越多的研究人员需要从Python或R中访问底层的Java代码，现有的方法不够满足需求。我们提供了新的、最新的方法，使用JPype Python-Java接口和Reticulate Python-R接口，直接解决了这些问题。通过添加一些简单的工具和提供Python和R的工作示例，使用JPype和Reticulate将Python和R与Tetrad进行接口化变得简单直观。",
