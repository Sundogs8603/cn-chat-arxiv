    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), a severe and progressive neurological illness, affects millions of individuals worldwide. For effective treatment and management of PD, an accurate and early diagnosis is crucial. This study presents a deep learning-based model for the diagnosis of PD using resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) signal. The objective of the study is to develop an automated model that can extract complex hidden nonlinear features from EEG and demonstrate its generalizability on unseen data. The model is designed using a hybrid model, consists of convolutional neural network (CNN), bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU), and attention mechanism. The proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets (Uc San Diego Dataset, PRED-CT, and University of Iowa (UI) dataset), with one dataset used for training and the other two for evaluation. The results show that the proposed model can accurately diagnose PD with high performance on both the training and hold-out datasets. T",
