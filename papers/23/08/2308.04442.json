    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习是一种分布式机制，通过多个客户端的参与训练大规模神经网络模型，数据仍然保留在其设备上，只分享本地模型更新。这个特点使得联邦学习被认为是解决数据隐私问题的安全解决方案。然而，传统的联邦学习结构依赖于客户端-服务器，这导致了单点故障攻击，随机选择客户端进行模型训练也会影响模型的准确性。此外，对手还试图进行推理攻击，即对隐私的攻击会导致梯度泄露攻击。我们在这一背景下提出了基于区块链的优化客户选择和隐私保护框架。我们设计了三种智能合约，包括1) 客户端注册，2) 正向竞价选择优化客户进行联邦学习模型训练，3) 付款结算和奖励智能合约。此外，我们还使用Cheon, Kim, Kim和Son的完全同态加密方法。",
