This is particularly problematic in tasks heavily influenced by subjectivity, such as hate speech detection. To delve into how individuals from different countries perceive hate speech, we introduce CReHate, a cross-cultural re-annotation of the sampled SBIC dataset. This dataset includes annotations from five distinct countries: Australia, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Our thorough statistical analysis highlights significant differences based on nationality, with only 59.4% of the samples achieving consensus among all countries. We also introduce a culturally sensitive hate speech classifier via transfer learning, adept at capturing perspectives of different nationalities.

    "translated_abstract": "英语数据集主要反映了特定国家的观点，这可能导致模型和数据集中存在文化偏差。这在受主观性影响较大的任务，如仇恨言论检测中特别有问题。为了深入了解来自不同国家的个体如何理解仇恨言论，我们介绍了CReHate，对抽样的SBIC数据集进行了跨文化重新注释。该数据集包括来自五个不同国家的注释：澳大利亚、新加坡、南非、英国和美国。我们进行了彻底的统计分析，发现基于国籍存在显著差异，只有59.4%的样本在所有国家之间达成共识。我们还通过迁移学习引入了一种具有文化敏感性的仇恨言论分类器，能够捕捉不同国籍的观点。这些发现强调了需要重新评估自然语言处理研究的某些方面，特别是对于仇恨言论的细微性质。",
