    "abstract": "This paper presents a set of industrial-grade text processing models for Hungarian that achieve near state-of-the-art performance while balancing resource efficiency and accuracy. Models have been implemented in the spaCy framework, extending the HuSpaCy toolkit with several improvements to its architecture. Compared to existing NLP tools for Hungarian, all of our pipelines feature all basic text processing steps including tokenization, sentence-boundary detection, part-of-speech tagging, morphological feature tagging, lemmatization, dependency parsing and named entity recognition with high accuracy and throughput. We thoroughly evaluated the proposed enhancements, compared the pipelines with state-of-the-art tools and demonstrated the competitive performance of the new models in all text preprocessing steps. All experiments are reproducible and the pipelines are freely available under a permissive license.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一套用于匈牙利文本处理的工业级模型，这些模型在资源效率和准确性之间取得了接近最先进的性能。这些模型是基于spaCy框架实现的，在HuSpaCy工具包的架构上进行了多个改进。与现有的匈牙利语自然语言处理工具相比，我们所有的管道都具备包括标记化、句子边界检测、词性标注、词形特征标注、词形还原、依存句法分析和命名实体识别在内的所有基本文本处理步骤，并且具有高准确性和高吞吐量。我们对提出的改进进行了全面评估，将管道与最先进的工具进行了比较，并在所有文本预处理步骤中展示了新模型的竞争性能。所有实验都可以重现，并且这些管道可以免费使用并采用宽松的许可证。",
