    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习中，多元时间序列分类是一个越来越相关的领域。目前的技术集中于识别局部重要的序列片段或者建立全局长期依赖关系。然而，它们经常忽视了来自全局和局部特征的合并数据。本研究利用双重注意机制，探索了一种新的网络（DA-Net）用于多元时间序列分类，以提取局部和全局特征。DA-Net包括两个不同的层，即Squeeze-Excitation Window Attention（SEWA）层和Sparse Self-Attention within Windows（SSAW）层。DA-Net能够基于这两个扩展层提取必要的局部序列片段，建立全局长期依赖关系。",
    "tldr": "通过引入双重注意力机制，该论文提出了一种全新的网络（DA-Net），用于多元时间序列分类。DA-Net能够同时提取局部和全局特征，从而识别关键的局部序列片段并建立全局长期依赖关系。",
