    "abstract": "This paper explores alternatives for integrating two subdisciplines of AI in the construction of artificial agents that exhibit intelligent behavior: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Cognitive Architectures (CAs). Guided by theoretical models and supported by preliminary empirical data, we hypothesize how diverse synergistic approaches can mutually compensate for their respective weaknesses and limitations, ultimately fostering more robust and sophisticated artificial intelligence systems. Additionally, we discuss the tradeoffs and challenges associated with each approach.",
