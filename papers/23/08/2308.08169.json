    "translated_abstract": "通过利用预训练模型的先进自然语言理解和生成能力，端到端任务导向型对话系统已经取得了令人满意的性能。本文通过一个简单的缓存使得任务导向型对话系统更加灵活。这个缓存能够动态更新系统并处理现有和未知的对话场景。具体来说，我们首先对检索模块进行微调，以便从缓存中有效地检索到最相关的信息。然后，我们训练端到端的对话系统模型，这些模型在生成对话时可以引用和联系对话历史和检索到的信息。缓存的构建非常简单，而任务导向型对话系统的主干模型与现有的预训练生成模型兼容。通过大量的实验验证了我们的框架的优越性能，非空联合目标准确率相对于强基线方法提高了6.7%。",
