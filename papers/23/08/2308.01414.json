    "translated_abstract": "可再生能源对于实现碳中和目标至关重要。大型语言模型（LLMs）的成功应用，如ChatGPT在自动内容生成方面的成功，使得LLMs在可再生能源领域扮演越来越重要的角色。然而，目前还没有专门为可再生能源领域设计的LLM，也没有任何可再生能源的数据集用于训练LLM。因此，本论文发布了第一个面向非商业性可再生能源LLM研究的开源可再生能源学术论文（REAP）数据集。REAP数据集通过从Web of Science搜索1168970篇学术文献的标题和摘要进行收集。基于REAP数据集，通过对通用LLMs进行微调，开发了第一个针对可再生能源的LLM模型HouYi。HouYi在可再生能源领域展示了强大的学术论文段落生成能力。实验结果显示，它在生成可再生能源学术论文方面的能力与ChatGPT相当，在某些方面略优于Clau。",
