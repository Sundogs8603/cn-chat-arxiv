    "abstract": "Classical recommender systems often assume that historical data are stationary and fail to account for the dynamic nature of user preferences, limiting their ability to provide reliable recommendations in time-sensitive settings. This assumption is particularly problematic in finance, where financial products exhibit continuous changes in valuations, leading to frequent shifts in client interests. These evolving interests, summarized in the past client-product interactions, see their utility fade over time with a degree that might differ from one client to another. To address this challenge, we propose a time-dependent collaborative filtering algorithm that can adaptively discount distant client-product interactions using personalized decay functions. Our approach is designed to handle the non-stationarity of financial data and produce reliable recommendations by modeling the dynamic collaborative signals between clients and products. We evaluate our method using a proprietary dataset ",

    "translated_abstract": "传统的推荐系统通常假设历史数据是不变的，无法考虑用户偏好的动态性，限制了它们在时间敏感环境中提供可靠推荐的能力。这一假设在金融领域尤其有问题，因为金融产品的估值不断变化，导致客户兴趣频繁转移。这些演变的兴趣可以通过过去客户-产品交互中总结出来，其效用随着时间的推移会因客户而异。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种时间相关的协同过滤算法，可以使用个性化衰减函数自适应地折价远离的客户-产品交互。我们的方法旨在处理金融数据的非平稳性，并通过建模客户和产品之间的动态协同信号来产生可靠的推荐。我们使用专有数据集对我们的方法进行评估。",
