    "abstract": "Simile detection is a valuable task for many natural language processing (NLP)-based applications, particularly in the field of literature. However, existing research on simile detection often relies on corpora that are limited in size and do not adequately represent the full range of simile forms. To address this issue, we propose a simile data augmentation method based on \\textbf{W}ord replacement And Sentence completion using the GPT-2 language model. Our iterative process called I-WAS, is designed to improve the quality of the augmented sentences. To better evaluate the performance of our method in real-world applications, we have compiled a corpus containing a more diverse set of simile forms for experimentation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed data augmentation method for simile detection.",

    "translated_abstract": "比喻检测是许多自然语言处理（NLP）应用中的一项有价值的任务，尤其在文学领域。然而，现有的比喻检测研究常常依赖于规模有限且未能充分代表比喻形式的语料库。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于GPT-2语言模型的比喻数据增强方法，该方法通过\\textbf{替换词汇}和\\textbf{完成句子}的方式进行。我们的迭代过程称为I-WAS，旨在提高增强句子的质量。为了更好地评估我们的方法在实际应用中的性能，我们编制了一个包含更多不同比喻形式的语料库进行实验。我们的实验结果证明了我们提出的比喻检测数据增强方法的有效性。",
