We present and analyze four early exiting architectures and a customized multi-branch training algorithm for this problem.

    "translated_abstract": "自动调制分类在无线通信中起着关键作用，通过自主地对无线频谱上传输的信号进行分类。由于深度学习技术能够提取复杂的无线信号特征，因此越来越多地将其用于自动调制分类。然而，深度学习模型计算密集且推理延迟较高。本文提出了在用于自动调制分类的深度学习模型中应用早期退出技术以加速推理。我们提出并分析了四种早期退出架构和针对该问题的定制多分支训练算法。通过大量实验，我们表明在信噪比（SNR）适中至较高的信号上更容易进行分类，不需要深度结构，因此可以利用所提出的早期退出架构。我们的实验结果表明，早期退出技术可以显著降低深度神经网络的推理速度，同时不损失分类性能。",
