    "translated_abstract": "高频金融资产交易数据的建模一直是统计学家和计量经济学家感兴趣的领域，尤其是对金融持续时间时间序列的分析。自回归条件持续时间（ACD）模型一直是建模金融交易数据的主要工具，其中持续时间通常定义为两个连续事件之间的时间间隔。这些模型通常以时变均值（或中位数）条件持续时间的形式进行规定。本文提出了ACD模型的新扩展，该模型基于以分位数重新参数化的对数对称分布。所提出的分位数对数对称条件持续时间自回归模型允许我们对不同的百分位数进行建模，而不是传统上使用的均值（或中位数）条件持续时间。我们开展了对于理论性质和实际问题（如使用最大似然估计进行参数估计）的深入研究。",
