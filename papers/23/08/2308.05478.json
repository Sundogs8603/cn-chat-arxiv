    "translated_abstract": "最近高分辨率4D(3+1D)雷达传感器的发展和市场引入推动了基于深度学习的雷达感知研究。我们研究了在雷达点云上运行的基于深度学习的3D目标检测模型。3D激光雷达点云上的3D目标检测是3D视觉领域的成熟领域，已经提出了许多不同的架构，各具优势和劣势。由于3D激光雷达点云和3+1D雷达点云之间的相似性，现有的3D目标检测器是基于雷达数据进行深度学习的3D目标检测的自然基础。因此，第一步是分析现有模型在新数据模态上的检测性能，并对其进行深入评估。为了将针对激光雷达点云开发的现有3D点云目标检测器应用于雷达领域，首先需要进行适应性调整。虽然已经对一些检测器进行了适应性调整，例如PointPillars，以使其适用于雷达数据。",
