    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种名为特征强化物理信息神经网络（FE-PINN）的新型无数据框架。该框架能够在主训练循环之前以较低的计算成本学习任何问题的底层模式。由于存在偏微分残差和边界条件均方误差两个项，普通PINN的损失函数不平衡。FE-PINN通过只需一分钟的训练，而不是耗时数小时的超参数调优来解决这个挑战。FE-PINN通过执行一系列子任务来完成这个过程。第一个子任务学习有关底层物理的有用特征。然后，模型在目标任务上进行训练以完善计算。FE-PINN应用于三个基准问题：圆柱体上的流动、二维热传导以及计算入口速度的逆问题。FE-PINN可以分别加速15倍、2倍和5倍地解决每个案例。另外",
