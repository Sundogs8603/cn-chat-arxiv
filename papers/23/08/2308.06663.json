    "translated_abstract": "时间序列数据中的异常检测是各个领域（如制造业，医学成像和网络安全）中常见的问题，旨在识别偏离正常行为的点。最近，生成对抗网络（GANs）在检测时间序列数据中的异常方面显示出了有效性。GANs的神经网络结构（即生成器和鉴别器）可以显着提高异常检测准确性。本文提出了一种新的GAN模型，名为Adjusted-LSTM GAN（ALGAN），它调整LSTM网络的输出，以提高单变量和多变量时间序列数据的异常检测能力，而且是在无监督设置下进行的。我们在46个真实世界的单变量时间序列数据集和涵盖多个领域的大型多变量数据集上评估了ALGAN的性能。我们的实验表明，ALGAN在时间序列数据的异常检测中优于传统的、基于神经网络的和其他基于GAN的方法。",
