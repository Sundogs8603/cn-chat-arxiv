    "translated_abstract": "非线性动力系统的识别已经被广泛应用于通过顺序阈值最小二乘（STLS）算法进行非线性动力学的稀疏识别（SINDy）。许多SINDy的扩展在文献中出现，以处理长度有限且噪音较大的实验数据。最近，提出了集成引导SINDy模型（E-SINDy）的计算密集型方法来进行模型识别，处理有限且噪音较大的数据。虽然SINDy的扩展很多，但它们促进稀疏估计的估计器有时会提供动态的稀疏近似，而不是精确恢复。此外，这些估计器在多重共线性下存在问题，例如Lasso的不可表示条件。在本文中，我们证明修剪的Lasso用于对模型进行稳健识别（TRIM）可以在较严重的噪声、有限数据和多重共线性下提供精确恢复，而不同于E-SINDy。",
