    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的方法，通过最佳利用辅助面板数据的信息，为具有缺失观测值的大目标面板模型估计潜在因子。我们将我们的估计器称为目标-PCA。从辅助面板数据中的迁移学习使我们能够处理大部分缺失观测值和目标面板中的弱信号。我们展示了我们的估计器更高效，并可以一致估计不可用传统方法确定的弱因子。我们在近似因子模型和缺失模式的非常一般假设下，提供了目标-PCA的渐近推断理论。在一个混合频率宏观经济面板数据的数据插补的实证研究中，我们证明了目标PCA明显优于所有基准方法。",

It utilizes transfer learning from auxiliary panel data to handle missing observations and weak signals, resulting in a more efficient estimation of weak factors. In empirical study, Target PCA outperforms all benchmark methods in imputing data in a mixed-frequency macroeconomic panel."
