    "translated_abstract": "从历史上看，黄金和白银在传统货币系统中起着不同的作用。黄金被视为优秀的价值存储工具，导致人们囤积黄金，而白银通常被用作交换媒介。随着金融世界的发展，加密货币的出现引入了一种新的价值和交换范式。然而，这些数字资产作为价值存储工具的特性仍然很少被研究。莱特币的创始人Charlie Lee曾将比特币比作黄金，莱特币比作白银。为了验证这个比喻，我们的研究采用了几种指标，包括未花费的交易输出（UTXO），已花费的交易输出（STXO），加权平均寿命（WAL），CoinDaysDestroyed（CDD）和公开的链上交易数据。此外，我们还设计了以价格-效用比率（PU）为核心的交易策略，为加密资产的估值提供了一种新的视角，超越了传统的用途。我们的回测结果没有",
