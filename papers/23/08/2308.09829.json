    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种学习算法，用于本地路由策略，它只需要从单个图形中获得的少量数据样本，同时能够推广到标准模型中的所有随机图形的无线网络。因此，我们通过训练深度神经网络（DNNs）来解决全局近最短路径问题，这些DNNs能够高效且可扩展地学习仅考虑节点状态和相邻节点状态的本地路由策略。值得注意的是，我们训练的其中一个DNN学习的策略完全符合贪婪转发的性能，另一个则普遍优于贪婪转发。我们的算法设计从多个方面充分利用了网络领域知识：首先，在选择输入特征时；其次，在选择“种子图”及其最短路径的子采样时。领域知识的利用为学习提供了理论解释，说明了为什么种子图和节点子采样足以实现有效、可扩展和可推广的学习。模拟实验验证了我们算法的性能，并与其他方法进行了比较。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a learning algorithm that can generalize to all random graphs in wireless networks by training deep neural networks using a few data samples obtained from a single graph. The algorithm learns local routing policies that consider only node states and neighboring node states, and it achieves performance comparable or superior to greedy forwarding. The algorithm utilizes network domain knowledge in selecting input features and a seed graph, enabling efficient, scalable, and generalizable learning."
