    "translated_abstract": "半监督学习旨在在标签昂贵的情况下利用大量未标记的数据。然而，在许多真实世界的应用中，收集到的未标记数据不可避免地会包含不属于任何已标记类别的未见类别的异常值。为了应对具有挑战性的开放集半监督学习任务，主流方法往往首先检测异常值，然后过滤它们。然而，我们观察到一个令人惊讶的事实，当标签极为稀缺时，这种方法可能导致更严重的性能下降，因为不可靠的异常值检测器可能错误地排除了大量有价值的内点。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种新颖的开放集半监督学习框架——IOMatch，它可以在内点和外点难以区分的情况下共同利用它们。具体而言，我们提出了一种多二值分类器，结合标准的闭集分类器，用于生成统一的开放集分类结果。",
