Currently, only daily resolution data are available for most of Norwegian hydropower plant, however, to achieve more accurate management, sub-daily resolution data are often required. To deal with the wide absence of sub-daily data, time series disaggregation is a potential tool. In this study, we proposed a time series disaggregation model based on deep learning, the model is tested using flow data from a Norwegian flow station, to disaggregate the daily flow into hourly flow. Preliminary results show some promising aspects for the proposed model.",

    "translated_abstract": "高时空分辨率数据对于水电站管理至关重要。目前，大部分挪威水电站只有每日分辨率的数据，然而，为了实现更精确的管理，通常需要亚日分辨率的数据。为了解决亚日数据的普遍缺失，时间序列分解是一种潜在的工具。在本研究中，我们提出了一个基于深度学习的时间序列分解模型，该模型使用挪威某流量测站的数据进行测试，将每日流量分解为每小时流量。初步结果显示了该模型的一些有希望的方面。",
