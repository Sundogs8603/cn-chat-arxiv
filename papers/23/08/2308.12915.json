    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一款名为《一千零一夜》的AI本地化游戏，通过与由大型语言模型驱动的角色共同创作故事，玩家可以引导游戏中的现实。该概念受到维特根斯坦关于语言界限决定一个人世界界限的思想的启发。使用GPT-4和稳定扩散等先进的AI工具，游戏的第二次迭代使得主角沙赫拉萨德能够在她的世界中实现文字和故事。玩家可以与AI国王进行对话，引导对特定关键词的讨论，这些关键词随后成为游戏中的战斗装备。这种互动叙事和文本到图像转换的结合通过双重视角挑战了游戏世界与现实之间的传统边界。我们关注的是试图改变自己命运的沙赫拉萨德，以及与AI合作创作故事并塑造游戏世界的玩家。我们探索了实现这一概念的技术和设计要素。",
