    "translated_abstract": "在线多目标跟踪（MOT）在自主系统中起着关键作用。现有的最先进方法通常采用跟踪-检测方法，数据关联起到了至关重要的作用。本文提出了一个学习和图优化（LEGO）的模块化跟踪器，以提高数据关联性能。所提出的LEGO跟踪器集成了图优化和自注意力机制，能够有效地制定关联评分图，从而实现准确高效的目标匹配。为了进一步增强状态更新过程，本文还添加了卡尔曼滤波器，通过将对象状态的时间连贯性纳入跟踪中，确保一致的跟踪。与其他在线跟踪方法（包括基于LiDAR和基于LiDAR-相机融合的方法）相比，我们提出的仅利用LiDAR的方法表现出了卓越性能。在提交结果至KITTI目标跟踪评估排行榜时，LEGO排名第一。",
