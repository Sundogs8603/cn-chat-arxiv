    "translated_abstract": "Polkadot 生态系统是一种具有颠覆性和高度复杂的多链架构，对数据分析和可交流性提出了挑战。目前，缺乏标准化和全面的方法来检索和分析跨平行链和应用的数据，使得一般用户和开发者难以一致地访问生态系统数据。本文提出了一个概念框架，包括一个名为 POnto（Polkadot Ontology）的领域本体，以解决这些挑战。POnto 提供了生态系统概念和关系的结构化表示，实现了对平台的形式化理解。提出的知识导向方法增强了集成和可交流性，使更广泛的用户能够参与生态系统，并促进基于人工智能的应用的开发。文章提出了一个案例研究方法来验证所提出的框架，包括来自Polkado的专家反馈和见解。",
