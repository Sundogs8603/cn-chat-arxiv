    "abstract": "This paper tackles the challenging task of evaluating socially situated conversational robots and presents a novel objective evaluation approach that relies on multimodal user behaviors. In this study, our main focus is on assessing the human-likeness of the robot as the primary evaluation metric. While previous research often relied on subjective evaluations from users, our approach aims to evaluate the robot's human-likeness based on observable user behaviors indirectly, thus enhancing objectivity and reproducibility. To begin, we created an annotated dataset of human-likeness scores, utilizing user behaviors found in an attentive listening dialogue corpus. We then conducted an analysis to determine the correlation between multimodal user behaviors and human-likeness scores, demonstrating the feasibility of our proposed behavior-based evaluation method.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了评估社交位置对话机器人的挑战性任务，并提出了一种新颖的客观评价方法，该方法依赖于多模态用户行为。在本研究中，我们的主要关注点是评估机器人的人类相似度作为主要评价指标。而以往的研究常常依赖于用户的主观评价，我们的方法旨在通过间接观察用户行为来评估机器人的人类相似度，从而增强客观性和可复现性。首先，我们创建了一个使用关注性对话语料库中的用户行为来标注人类相似度分数的数据集。然后我们进行了分析，确定了多模态用户行为与人类相似度分数之间的相关性，证明了我们提出的基于行为的评估方法的可行性。",
