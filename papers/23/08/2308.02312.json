    "translated_abstract": "Q&A平台在过去十年中一直是程序员网上求助行为的重要组成部分。然而，随着ChatGPT的推出，网上求助行为的范式正在发生变化。尽管ChatGPT很受欢迎，但尚未进行全面的研究来评估ChatGPT回答软件工程问题的特点或可用性。为了填补这个空白，我们对ChatGPT回答517个Stack Overflow（SO）问题进行了首次深入分析，并对ChatGPT回答的正确性、一致性、综合性和简洁性进行了检查。此外，我们进行了大规模的语言分析和用户研究，以了解ChatGPT回答在语言和人类方面的特点。我们的分析表明，52％的ChatGPT回答是错误的，77％的回答冗长。尽管如此，由于其综合性和清晰的语言表达，ChatGPT回答仍然在39.34％的情况下受到青睐。",
