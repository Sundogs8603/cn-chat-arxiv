    "translated_abstract": "点击率（CTR）预测是在线广告等工业应用中的关键问题，它估计用户点击某个项目的概率。许多研究致力于用户行为建模以提高CTR预测性能，但大多数方法只从用户点击项目中建模用户的正向兴趣，忽略了展示项目周围的上下文信息，导致性能较差。本文强调了上下文信息对用户行为建模的重要性，并提出了一个名为深度上下文兴趣网络（DCIN）的新模型，该模型通过完整地建模点击及其展示上下文来学习用户的上下文感知兴趣。DCIN包括三个关键模块：1）位置感知上下文聚合模块（PCAM），通过注意机制对展示项目进行聚合；2）反馈-上下文融合模块（FCFM），通过非线性函数将点击和展示上下文的表示进行融合；",
