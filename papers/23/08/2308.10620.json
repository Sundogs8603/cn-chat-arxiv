    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLM）在包括软件工程在内的多个领域产生了显著影响。许多最近的文献探讨了LLM在各种软件工程任务和应用中的应用。然而，对LLM在软件工程中的应用、影响和可能的限制的全面理解仍处于初级阶段。为了弥补这一差距，我们对LLM与软件工程的交叉领域进行了系统性文献综述，特别关注LLM在软件工程中如何被利用来优化过程和结果的理解。我们收集和分析了2017年至2023年的229篇研究论文，以回答四个关键研究问题（RQs）。在RQ1中，我们对在软件工程任务中使用的不同LLM进行分类和比较分析，描绘其独特的特点和用途。在RQ2中，我们分析数据收集、预处理和应用中使用的方法，强调了强大、精心策划的数据集对于成功利用LLM非常重要。",
