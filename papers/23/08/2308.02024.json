    "translated_abstract": "在过去十年中，人工智能和机器学习的进展是由于训练更大的深度神经网络(DNNs)的能力推动的，这导致了远远超过摩尔定律提供的硬件性能增长的计算需求。训练DNNs是一个极其内存密集的过程，需要存储整个minibatch的模型权重、激活和梯度。提供高密度和低泄漏的片上存储器的需求促使我们探索新兴的非易失性存储器用于训练加速器。自旋转矩传输磁阻存储器(STT-MRAM)在训练加速器中具有几个令人满意的特性，包括比SRAM高3-4倍的密度，大大降低的泄漏功率，高耐久性和合理的访问时间。然而，MRAM的写操作由于需要确保可靠切换，会产生高写能量和延迟。在本研究中，我们进行了全面的从器件到系统的评估和协同优化。",
