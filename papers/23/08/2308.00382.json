    "translated_abstract": "在许多应用中，双有源桥（DAB）变换器因其出色的功率密度和双向功率传输能力而受到欢迎。到目前为止，三相移位（TPS）可以被认为是DAB变换器最先进的调制技术之一。它可以扩大零电压开关范围并显著提高功率效率。当前，当DAB变换器在TPS调制下时，电流应力已成为一个重要的性能指标。然而，要在DAB变换器在TPS调制下最小化电流应力，分析过程和实现过程中存在两个困难。首先，TPS调制中的三个调制变量对不同操作模式下的电流应力分析带来了挑战。这个分析和推导过程导致了重计算负荷，并且受到低精度的困扰。其次，要实现TPS调制，如果使用查找表，则需要较大的存储器。",
