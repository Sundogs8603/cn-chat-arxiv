    "translated_abstract": "大气中的氮氧化物（NOx）主要来自燃料燃烧，对健康和环境有明显的急性和慢性影响。机器学习（ML）方法显著增强了我们在高时空分辨率下预测地面上NOx浓度的能力，但由于缺乏有关大气污染动力学的物理和化学知识，可能存在高估偏差。化学传输模型（CTMs）利用这些知识；然而，准确预测地面浓度通常需要进行广泛的后校准。在这里，我们提出了一个物理先验的深度学习框架，通过编码平流-扩散机制和流体动力学约束来联合预测NO2和NOx，并将ML模型的偏差降低了21-42％。我们的方法捕捉到了NO2和NOx的细粒度传输，生成了强大的空间外推，并提供了明确的不确定性估计。该框架将CTM的知识驱动的物理化学原理与深度学习相融合。",
