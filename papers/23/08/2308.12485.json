    "abstract": "Shrinkage methods are frequently used to estimate fixed effects to reduce the noisiness of the least square estimators. However, widely used shrinkage estimators guarantee such noise reduction only under strong distributional assumptions. I develop an estimator for the fixed effects that obtains the best possible mean squared error within a class of shrinkage estimators. This class includes conventional shrinkage estimators and the optimality does not require distributional assumptions. The estimator has an intuitive form and is easy to implement. Moreover, the fixed effects are allowed to vary with time and to be serially correlated, and the shrinkage optimally incorporates the underlying correlation structure in this case. In such a context, I also provide a method to forecast fixed effects one period ahead.",

    "translated_abstract": "缩小估计方法经常被用于估计固定效应，以减少最小二乘估计的噪声。然而，广泛使用的缩小估计仅在强分布假设下才能保证降低噪声。本文开发了一种估计固定效应的估计器，在缩小估计器类别中获得了最佳的均方误差。该类别包括传统的缩小估计器，且最优性不需要分布假设。该估计器具有直观的形式，并且易于实现。此外，固定效应允许随时间变化，并且可以具有序列相关性，而缩小方法在这种情况下可以最优地结合底层相关结构。在这样的背景下，还提供了一种预测未来一个时期固定效应的方法。",
