    "translated_abstract": "对话情感识别（ERC）已成为对话机器人和问答系统等领域的研究热点。如何高效地获取上下文中的情感线索一直是ERC任务中的关键挑战之一。现有的方法未能充分建模上下文，并采用复杂的网络结构，导致计算资源消耗过大而没有实质性的性能提升。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于课程学习策略的新型Emotion Recognition Network（ERNetCL）。该方法主要由Temporal Encoder（TE）、Spatial Encoder（SE）和Curriculum Learning（CL） loss组成。我们利用TE和SE以简洁的方式结合了以前方法的优点，以有效地捕捉对话中的时间和空间上下文信息。为了模拟人类从易到难的课程学习方式，我们将CL的思想应用到ERC任务中，逐步优化网络构架。",
