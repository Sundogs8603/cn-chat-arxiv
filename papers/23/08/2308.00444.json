    "translated_abstract": "许多宏观经济时间序列在条件均值和条件方差上都表现出非线性，实践中重要的是要分别研究这两个方面。本文针对条件异方差的情况，提出了一种在条件均值中测试阈值非线性的最高拉格朗日乘子方法。我们提出了一个线性ARMA-GARCH模型的检验，测试其与TARMA-GARCH模型的假设对立。我们推导了检验统计量的渐近零分布，由于在零假设下不存在的干扰参数，与GARCH型创新相结合的非线性移动平均使得此问题更加困难。我们发现，没有考虑异方差性的测试即使在大样本情况下也无法达到正确的大小。此外，我们还展示了TARMA模型的优势，能够自然地解决广泛存在的测量误差问题。",
