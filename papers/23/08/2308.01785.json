    "translated_abstract": "词形还原是一种自然语言处理技术，用于将单词的词形派生转化为其词根形式以归一化文本。它被用作许多自然语言处理任务（包括文本索引、信息检索和自然语言处理的机器学习等）的核心预处理步骤。本文首次开发了索马里语的文本词形还原，这是一种资源匮乏的语言，以前几乎没有有效采用自然语言处理方法和数据集。我们特别为索马里文本开发了一个词表和基于规则的词形还原器，这是一个为各种自然语言处理任务构建全面索马里语词形还原系统的起点。考虑到语言的词法规则，我们开发了一个包含1247个词根词和7173个词形派生相关术语的初始词表，并丰富了用于词形还原词表中不存在的词的规则。我们在包括新闻文章、社交媒体帖子和文本在内的各种长度的120个文档上测试了算法。",
