    "translated_abstract": "在真实世界的安全需求应用中，准确且快速地处理非分布样本是至关重要的。本文首先研究了三维点云的临界点与非分布样本之间的相互作用。我们的研究发现，常见的数据损坏和离群点往往会被解释为临界点。我们将临界点的概念推广为重要性度量。我们证明，仅基于非重要点的分类网络训练，可以大大提高鲁棒性，而在干净数据集上会稍微损失一些性能。我们观察到，标准化熵对于数据损坏分析非常有信息量。建议基于标准化熵选择非临界点集合的自适应阈值。我们提出的重要性度量计算极其快速。我们展示了它可以用于多种应用，例如可解释AI(XAI)，离群值去除，不确定性估计，鲁棒分类和对抗性防御。",
