    "translated_abstract": "步态分析是一个重要的研究领域，具有在安全、医疗、体育和人机交互等方面的众多应用。最近，步态模式被视为一种远距离自动人员识别的独特指纹方法。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为Gait Pyramid Transformer（GaitPT）的新型步态识别架构，它利用姿势估计骨骼来捕捉独特的步态模式，而不依赖外貌信息。GaitPT采用分层变压器架构，在解剖学上一致地提取运动的空间和时间特征，通过人体骨骼结构进行引导。我们的结果表明，与其他基于骨骼的步态识别方法相比，GaitPT在控制场景和野外场景中均实现了最先进的性能。GaitPT在CASIA-B上获得了82.6%的平均准确率，优于其他作品6%的差距。",
