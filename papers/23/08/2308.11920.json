    "translated_abstract": "可解释性是构建可靠模型用于各种医学应用中的关键因素。概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)通过利用人类可理解的概念作为中间目标实现可解释的图像分类。与传统方法需要大量人工劳动来构建概念集不同，最近利用大型语言模型(LLMs)生成概念的工作使自动生成概念成为可能。然而，这些方法没有考虑概念是否与视觉相关，而这是计算有意义概念得分的重要因素。因此，我们提出了一种视觉激活得分，用来衡量概念是否包含视觉线索，这可以通过未标记的图像数据轻松计算。计算得到的视觉激活得分然后用于过滤出不太可见的概念，从而得到一个具有视觉意义的最终概念集。我们的实验结果表明，采用所提出的视觉激活得分方法可以显著提高拟合度。",
