    "translated_abstract": "在非洲和全球范围内，越来越多的关注于开发神经机器翻译（NMT）系统，以克服语言障碍。对于低资源语言的NMT尤为引人注目，因为它涉及到有限标记数据的学习。然而，对于低资源语言来说，获取一个良好对齐的平行语料库可能有挑战性。查德地区全球少数语言的技术先进程度与NMT研究的不足之间存在明显差距。尚未尝试过在低资源查德语言上进行端到端NMT实验。此外，与一些非洲语言不同，自然语言处理领域的在线和结构化数据收集的数据匮乏。然而，通过指导性的数据收集方法，可以产生许多查德语言翻译对的双语数据，其中另一种语言是有大量数据的知名语言。在这个项目中，我们创建了第一个sba-Fr数据集，它是一个Ngambay到French的语料库。",
