    "translated_abstract": "不同于当前的节点级异常检测任务，图级异常检测的目标是寻找在图集中与其他图显著不同的异常图。由于对图级异常检测的研究较少，关于图级异常的详细描述不足。此外，现有工作集中于捕捉异常图信息以学习更好的图表示，但忽视了对评估异常图的有效异常得分函数的重要性。因此，在这项工作中，我们首先定义了在图集中包括节点和图属性异常的异常图信息，并分别采用节点级和图级信息差来识别它们。然后，我们引入了一个具有双学生-教师模型的判别性图级异常检测框架，其中教师模型通过一种启发式损失进行训练，使得图表示更为分散。然后，两个竞争的学生模型通过争夺任务来提高异常检测效果。",
