    "translated_abstract": "在功能性数据日益丰富的背景下，我们提出了一个用于$L^2[0,1]$中正则变化随机元素$X$的极值的一般概率统计框架。我们将自己置于一个峰值超过阈值的框架中，其中一个功能极值被定义为$L^2$范数$\\|X\\|$相对较大的观测值$X$。我们的目标是提出一个降维框架，从而为这种极值观测得到有限维度的投影。我们的贡献是双重的。首先，我们研究了随机数量在一般可分离的Hilbert空间中的正则变化概念，对此我们提出了一个仅涉及实值随机变量的随机收敛的新型具体表征。其次，我们提出了一种功能性主成分分析（PCA）的概念，可以考虑功能极值的主要“方向”。我们研究了经验协方差算子的统计性质。",
