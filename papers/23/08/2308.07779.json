    "translated_abstract": "知识追踪（KT）旨在通过学生与与概念相关的问题的学习互动来监测学生不断变化的知识状态，并可以通过预测学生在未来问题上的表现来进行间接评估。本文观察到一个常见的现象，即答案偏见，即每个问题的正确答案和错误答案高度不平衡的分布。现有模型倾向于将答案偏见作为一个捷径来实现在KT中的高预测性能，从而未能充分理解学生的知识状态。为了解决这个问题，我们从因果关系的角度来处理KT任务。首先建立了KT的因果图，从中我们确定了答案偏见对学生反应的直接因果效应。进一步提出了一种新颖的对策反事实推理（CORE）框架进行KT，该框架在训练过程中分别捕捉了总因果效应和直接因果效应，并减轻了答案偏见的影响。",
