    "translated_abstract": "不良药物反应（ADR）的预测在医疗保健和药物发现中起着至关重要的作用，可以降低患者死亡率并增强药物安全性。最近，许多研究致力于有效预测药物-ADR发生率。然而，这些方法要么没有有效利用非临床数据，即有关药物的物理、化学和生物信息，要么在训练阶段很少建立内容分析和纯协同过滤之间的联系。本文首先将多标签ADR的预测形式化为药物-ADR协同过滤问题，并且据我们所知，这是首个在两个大型公开临床数据集上提供先前协同过滤方法广泛基准结果的工作。然后，通过利用来自非临床数据的易获得的药物特性，我们提出了ADRNet，这是一个结合临床和非临床数据的广义协同过滤框架。",
