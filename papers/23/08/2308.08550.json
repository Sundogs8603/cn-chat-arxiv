    "abstract": "We extend recurrent neural networks to include several flexible timescales for each dimension of their output, which mechanically improves their abilities to account for processes with long memory or with highly disparate time scales. We compare the ability of vanilla and extended long short term memory networks (LSTMs) to predict asset price volatility, known to have a long memory. Generally, the number of epochs needed to train extended LSTMs is divided by two, while the variation of validation and test losses among models with the same hyperparameters is much smaller. We also show that the model with the smallest validation loss systemically outperforms rough volatility predictions by about 20% when trained and tested on a dataset with multiple time series.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们扩展了递归神经网络，为其输出的每个维度包括多个灵活的时间尺度，从而机械地改善了其对具有长期记忆或高度不同时间尺度的过程的建模能力。我们比较了普通的长短期记忆网络（LSTMs）和扩展的LSTMs在预测具有长期记忆的资产价格波动性方面的能力。通常情况下，训练扩展的LSTMs所需的时期数减少了一半，而具有相同超参数的模型在验证和测试损失的变化较小。我们还展示了，在使用多个时间序列的数据集进行训练和测试时，验证损失最小的模型比粗糙波动性预测的准确率高约20%。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了具有更灵活记忆的递归神经网络，能够更好地预测具有长期记忆的资产价格波动性，优于传统的粗糙波动性预测方法。",
