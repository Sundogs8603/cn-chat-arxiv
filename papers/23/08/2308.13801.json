    "translated_abstract": "随着深度学习技术的发展，监督学习已经取得了超越人类的性能。研究人员为不同的数据模态设计了许多相应的模型，在监督任务中取得了优秀的结果。然而，随着各个领域数据的指数增长，对未标记数据的识别和分类逐渐成为研究热点。在本文中，我们采用了一种基于强化学习的框架，模拟人类的认知过程，有效地解决开放集领域中的新类别发现问题。我们采用了一种成员-领导者多智能体框架，从多模态信息中提取和融合特征，旨在获得对特征空间更全面的理解。此外，这种方法促进了自监督学习的融入，以增强模型训练。我们采用了一种聚类方法，具有不同的约束条件，从严格到松散，从而实现了更好的探索和识别潜在的新类别。",
