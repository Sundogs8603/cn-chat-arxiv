    "abstract": "We present Lode Encoder, a gamified mixed-initiative level creation system for the classic platform-puzzle game Lode Runner. The system is built around several autoencoders which are trained on sets of Lode Runner levels. When fed with the user's design, each autoencoder produces a version of that design which is closer in style to the levels that it was trained on. The Lode Encoder interface allows the user to build and edit levels through 'painting' from the suggestions provided by the autoencoders. Crucially, in order to encourage designers to explore new possibilities, the system does not include more traditional editing tools. We report on the system design and training procedure, as well as on the evolution of the system itself and user tests.",
