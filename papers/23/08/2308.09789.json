    "abstract": "Aghamolla and Smith (2023) make a significant contribution to enhancing our understanding of how managers choose financial reporting complexity. I outline the key assumptions and implications of the theory, and discuss two empirical implications: (1) a U-shaped relationship between complexity and returns, and (2) a negative association between complexity and investor sophistication. However, the robust equilibrium also implies a counterfactual positive market response to complexity. I develop a simplified approach in which simple disclosures indicate positive surprises, and show that this implies greater investor skepticism toward complexity and a positive association between investor sophistication and complexity. More work is needed to understand complexity as an interaction of reporting and economic transactions, rather than solely as a reporting phenomenon.",

    "translated_abstract": "Aghamolla和Smith（2023）在加强我们对管理者如何选择财务报告复杂性方面做出了重要贡献。我概述了该理论的关键假设和影响，并讨论了两个实证影响：（1）复杂性与回报之间的U型关系，以及（2）复杂性与投资者的熟练程度之间的负关联。然而，稳健的均衡还意味着复杂性对市场的正反馈。我提出了一种简化的方法，即简单披露表示积极意外，并展示了这意味着投资者对复杂性持更大怀疑态度，以及投资者熟练程度与复杂性之间的正关联。需要进一步研究将复杂性视为报告和经济交易的交互作用，而不仅仅是一种报告现象。",
    "tldr": "Aghamolla and Smith (2023) contribute to our understanding of how managers choose financial reporting complexity. They find a U-shaped relationship between complexity and returns, and a negative association between complexity and investor sophistication. However, their findings also suggest a counterfactual positive market response to complexity. They propose a simplified approach where simple disclosures indicate positive surprises, leading to greater investor skepticism towards complexity and a positive association between investor sophistication and complexity. This highlights the need for further research to examine complexity as an interaction of reporting and economic transactions."
