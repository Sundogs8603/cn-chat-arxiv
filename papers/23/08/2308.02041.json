    "abstract": "The EU AI Act Article 5 is designed to regulate AI manipulation to prevent potential harmful consequences. However, the practical implementation of this legislation is challenging due to the ambiguous terminologies and the unclear presentations of manipulative techniques. Moreover, the Article 5 also suffers criticize of inadequate protective efficacy. This paper attempts to clarify terminologies and to enhance the protective efficacy by integrating insights from psychology and behavioral economics. Firstly, this paper employs cognitive psychology research to elucidate the term subliminal techniques and its associated representation. Additionally, this paper extends the study of heuristics: a set of thinking shortcuts which can be aroused for behavior changing from behavior economics to the realm of manipulative techniques. The elucidation and expansion of terminologies not only provide a more accurate understanding of the legal provision but also enhance its protective efficacy. Secon",

    "translated_abstract": "欧盟AI法案第5条旨在调节AI操纵，以防止潜在的有害后果。然而，由于术语模糊和操纵技术表述不清晰，这项立法的实际执行存在挑战。此外，第5条也受到保护效果不足的批评。本文试图通过整合心理学和行为经济学的见解，澄清术语并提高保护效果。首先，本文运用认知心理学研究阐明潜意识技巧及其相关表述。此外，本文将行为经济学中可以引发行为变化的一组思维快捷方式，即启发式，扩展到操纵技术领域。术语的阐明和扩展不仅提供了对法律规定更准确的理解，还增强了其保护效果。",
