    "translated_abstract": "本文展示了基因的有组织的数值表征在研究中的实用性，其中涉及到扁平字符串基因格式（例如FASTA/FASTQ）。FASTA/FASTQ文件目前存在一些限制，如文件大小大、映射和比对的处理速度慢以及上下文依赖性。这些挑战严重妨碍了涉及查找相似序列的调查和任务。解决方案是将序列转换为一种替代表示法，便于将其聚类到与原始序列相比更相似的组中。通过给每个短序列分配一个唯一的向量嵌入，可以更高效地聚类，并改善cDNA文库字符串表示的压缩性能。此外，通过学习基于密码子三聚体上下文的替代坐标向量嵌入，可以基于氨基酸性质进行聚类。最后，使用这种序列嵌入可以提高相似性搜索的效果，用于改进cDNA文库的压缩、相似性搜索、聚类、组织和操作。",
