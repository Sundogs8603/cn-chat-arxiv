    "title": "Emotion Embeddings $\\unicode{x2014}$ Learning Stable and Homogeneous Abstractions from Heterogeneous Affective Datasets. (arXiv:2308.07871v1 [cs.LG])",
    "abstract": "Human emotion is expressed in many communication modalities and media formats and so their computational study is equally diversified into natural language processing, audio signal analysis, computer vision, etc. Similarly, the large variety of representation formats used in previous research to describe emotions (polarity scales, basic emotion categories, dimensional approaches, appraisal theory, etc.) have led to an ever proliferating diversity of datasets, predictive models, and software tools for emotion analysis. Because of these two distinct types of heterogeneity, at the expressional and representational level, there is a dire need to unify previous work on increasingly diverging data and label types. This article presents such a unifying computational model. We propose a training procedure that learns a shared latent representation for emotions, so-called emotion embeddings, independent of different natural languages, communication modalities, media or representation label form",

    "translated_abstract": "人类情感通过多种交流方式和媒体格式表达，因此它们的计算研究同样多样化，涉及到自然语言处理、音频信号分析、计算机视觉等等。在先前的研究中，情感被以不同的形式进行描述（极性尺度、基本情感类别、维度方法、评价理论等），导致数据集、预测模型和情感分析软件工具的多样化增长。由于这两种不同类型的异质性，在表达和表示层面上，迫切需要统一以往对越来越分散的数据和标签类型的研究成果。本文提出了一个统一的计算模型。我们提出了一种训练过程，可以学习一种共享的情感潜在表示，即所谓情感嵌入，不依赖于不同的自然语言、交流方式、媒体或表示标签形式。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文提出了一种统一的计算模型，通过学习情感嵌入，独立于不同的语言、交流方式、媒体或标签形式，从而将以往对不同类型异质情感数据的研究整合起来。",
