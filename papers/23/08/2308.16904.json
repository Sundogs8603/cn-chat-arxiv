    "translated_abstract": "大规模线性系统Ax=b在实践中经常出现，需要有效的迭代求解器。通常，由于操作误差或错误的数据收集过程，这些系统会出现噪声。在过去的十年中，随机Kaczmarz（RK）算法已被广泛研究作为这些系统的高效迭代求解器。然而，现有对RK在噪声情况下的收敛性研究有限，只考虑右侧向量b中的测量噪声。不幸的是，在实践中，并不总是这样；系数矩阵A也可能是有噪声的。在本文中，我们分析了当系数矩阵A以及向量b都受有加性和乘性噪声影响时，RK的收敛性。在我们的分析中，变量 𝜏=∥ 𝜏 𝐴 ∗ ∥2^2 ∥ 𝐜𝐷𝐻∗𝑐 − 𝐛 ∥_𝐹^2🈶 𝑜 𝑅 的大小会影响RK的收敛性，其中 𝜏𝐴 表示A的带有噪声的版本。我们声称我们的分析是健壮且逼近实际的.",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper analyzes the convergence of the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm for solving noisy linear systems when both the coefficient matrix and the vector are corrupted with both additive and multiplicative noise. The analysis shows that the convergence of the algorithm depends on the size of a quantity 𝜏, which represents the product of the square of the multiplier norm of the noisy coefficient matrix A and the square of the Frobenius norm."
