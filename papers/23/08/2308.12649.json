    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在无奖励环境中的多样化技能发现，在简单的网格世界环境中发现所有可能的技能，先前的方法很难成功。这个问题被制定为使用内在奖励和一个经过训练的判别器来相互训练技能以预测给定轨迹的技能。我们的初始解决方案用全组对（all pairs）判别器替换了标准的一对多（softmax）判别器，并结合了一种新颖的内在奖励函数和丢弃（dropout）正则化技术。这种综合方法被命名为APART: 使用有升序奖励和丢弃技术的全组对多样化技能发现。我们证明APART比先前的方法更少样本就能发现网格世界中所有可能的技能。受到APART的实证成功的启发，我们进一步研究了一个更简单的算法，通过改变VIC，重新调整其内在奖励，并调节其softmax温度来实现最大化技能的目标。",
