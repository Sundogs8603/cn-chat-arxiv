    "abstract": "Science and Engineering fairs offer K-12 students opportunities to engage with authentic STEM practices. Particularly, students are given the chance to experience authentic and open inquiry processes, by defining which themes, questions and approaches will guide their scientific endeavors. In this study, we analyzed data from over 5,000 projects presented at a nationwide science fair in Brazil over the past 20 years using topic modeling to identify the main topics that have driven students' inquiry and design. Our analysis identified a broad range of topics being explored, with significant variations over time, region, and school setting. We argue those results and proposed methodology can not only support further research in the context of science fairs, but also inform instruction and design of contexts-specific resources to support students in open inquiry experiences in different settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "科学和工程竞赛为K-12学生提供了参与真实STEM实践的机会。本研究使用主题建模技术分析了巴西全国科学竞赛过去20年中超过5000个项目的数据，以识别推动学生探究和设计的主要主题。我们的分析发现，学生们探索了广泛的主题，并且随时间、地区和学校环境的变化而产生显著差异。我们认为这些结果和提出的方法不仅可以支持进一步的科学竞赛研究，还可以为不同环境中支持学生开展开放性探究活动的教学和设计提供资源。",
