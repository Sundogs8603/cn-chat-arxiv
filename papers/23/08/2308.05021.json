    "translated_abstract": "虽然扩散模型在数据合成方面取得了令人期待的成果，但由于其级联结构，即去噪模块链式传播和放大了分布不匹配的错误，因此可能会受到错误传播的影响。然而，我们期望进行严格的分析，因为许多顺序模型，如条件随机场（CRF），是不会出现错误传播的。在本文中，我们通过实证和理论验证了扩散模型确实受到错误传播的影响，并提出一种正则化方法来解决这个问题。我们的理论分析揭示了这个问题是否可以归结为扩散模型的每个去噪模块是否具有容错性。我们推导出了有深刻见解的转移方程，表明模块无法从输入错误中恢复，甚至会将额外的错误传播到下一个模块。我们的分析直接导致了扩散模型的一致性正则化方案，可以明确减少分布的差异。",
