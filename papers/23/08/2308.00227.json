The proposed framework promotes collaboration between architects and AI, facilitating a quick exploration of design ideas and producing context-sensitive, creative design generation. By integrating ChatGPT for scripting and Veras for generating design ideas with widely used parametric modeling and BIM tools, the framework provides architects with an intuitive and powerful method to convey design intent, leading to more efficient, creative, and collaborative design processes.",
