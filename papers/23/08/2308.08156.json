    "abstract": "During natural disasters, people often use social media platforms such as Twitter to ask for help, to provide information about the disaster situation, or to express contempt about the unfolding event or public policies and guidelines. This contempt is in some cases expressed as sarcasm or irony. Understanding this form of speech in a disaster-centric context is essential to improving natural language understanding of disaster-related tweets. In this paper, we introduce HurricaneSARC, a dataset of 15,000 tweets annotated for intended sarcasm, and provide a comprehensive investigation of sarcasm detection using pre-trained language models. Our best model is able to obtain as much as 0.70 F1 on our dataset. We also demonstrate that the performance on HurricaneSARC can be improved by leveraging intermediate task transfer learning. We release our data and code at https://github.com/tsosea2/HurricaneSarc.",

    "translated_abstract": "在自然灾害期间，人们经常使用Twitter等社交媒体平台寻求帮助、提供关于灾情的信息，或表达对灾情演变或公共政策和指导方针的蔑视。在灾难背景中理解这种言论形式对改进对灾害相关推文的自然语言理解至关重要。本文介绍了一种名为HurricaneSARC的数据集，该数据集包含了15,000条标记了讽刺意图的推文，并使用预训练语言模型对讽刺检测进行了全面研究。我们的最佳模型在我们的数据集上能够达到0.70的F1值。我们还证明，通过利用中间任务的迁移学习可以提高HurricaneSARC的性能。我们在https://github.com/tsosea2/HurricaneSarc上发布了我们的数据和代码。",
