    "translated_abstract": "传统的医学图像超分辨率（MISR）方法采用隐式的欠分辨率（UR）单元和明确的超分辨率（SR）单元的开环架构。UR单元可以始终给出、假设或估计，而SR单元根据各种SR算法进行精心设计。闭环反馈机制广泛应用于当前的MISR方法，并能有效提高其性能。反馈机制可以分为两类：局部反馈和全局反馈。因此，本文提出了一种基于全局反馈的闭环框架，即循环MISR（CMISR），具有明确的UR和SR元素。建立CMISR的数学模型和闭环方程。通过泰勒级数逼近的数学证明表明，CMISR在稳态下具有零恢复误差。此外，CMISR具有即插即用的特性，可以建立在任何现有的MISR算法上。分别提出了五种CMISR算法。",
