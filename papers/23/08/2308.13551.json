    "translated_abstract": "最近，虚拟环境中用于人际交互的数字人类引起了广泛关注。本文引入了一项新颖的多舞者合成任务，称为伙伴舞者生成，其涉及合成能够与用户一起跳舞的虚拟人类舞者。该任务旨在控制主导舞者和伙伴舞者之间的姿势多样性。这个任务的核心是确保生成的伙伴舞者具有可控的多样性，同时与主导舞者保持时间上的协调。与以往通过音乐驱动生成舞蹈动作的研究不同，我们的重点是根据预定义的多样性、主导舞者的姿势以及伴奏音乐自动设计伙伴舞者的姿势。为了实现这个目标，我们提出了一个称为“与你共舞”的三阶段框架（DanY）。首先，我们使用三维姿势收集阶段来收集各种基本舞蹈姿势作为参考姿势。",
