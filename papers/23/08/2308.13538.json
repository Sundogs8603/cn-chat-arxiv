    "abstract": "This paper introduces a system used to generate game feature suggestions based on a text prompt. Trained on the game descriptions of almost 60k games, it uses the word embeddings of a small GLoVe model to extract features and entities found in thematically similar games which are then passed through a generator model to generate new features for a user's prompt. We perform a short user study comparing the features generated from a fine-tuned GPT-2 model, a model using the ConceptNet, and human-authored game features. Although human suggestions won the overall majority of votes, the GPT-2 model outperformed the human suggestions in certain games. This system is part of a larger game design assistant tool that is able to collaborate with users at a conceptual level.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一个基于文本提示生成游戏特征建议的系统。该系统通过使用一个小型的GLoVe模型的词嵌入来提取主题相似的游戏中的特征和实体，并将其通过一个生成模型传递，用于生成用户提示的新特征。我们进行了一项短期用户研究，比较了来自一个经过微调的GPT-2模型、使用ConceptNet的模型以及人工编写的游戏特征生成的特征。虽然人工建议获得了绝大多数的投票，但在某些游戏中，GPT-2模型的表现超过了人工建议。该系统是一个更大的游戏设计助手工具的一部分，能够在概念层面上与用户进行协作。",
