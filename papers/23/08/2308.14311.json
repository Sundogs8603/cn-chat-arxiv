Prior works on epidemic control often assume complete knowledge of network structures, a presumption seldom valid in real-world situations. In this paper, we study epidemic control on networks with unknown structures, and propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for joint network structure exploration and epidemic control. To reduce the action space and achieve computation tractability, our proposed framework contains three modules: the Policy Selection Module, which determines whether to explore the structure or remove nodes to control the epidemic; the Explore Module, responsible for selecting nodes to explore; and the Remove Module, which decides which nodes to remove to stop the epidemic spread. Simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19等流行病对公共卫生和社会构成严重威胁，因此有必要研究有效的方法来控制流行病在网络中的传播。以往关于流行病控制的研究往往假设完全了解网络结构，这在实际情况中很少成立。本文研究了在未知结构的网络上的流行病控制，并提出了一种基于分层强化学习的框架，以同时探索网络结构和控制流行病。为了减少行动空间和实现可计算性，我们的框架包含三个模块：策略选择模块，确定是探索结构还是移除节点以控制流行病；探索模块，负责选择要探索的节点；移除模块，决定移除哪些节点以停止流行病传播。模拟结果表明，我们提出的方法优于基线方法。",
