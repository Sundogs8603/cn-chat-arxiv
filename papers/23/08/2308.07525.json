    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个用效用主义视角研究搜索的全面用户体验的新框架。虽然网络搜索引擎被广泛认为是“免费”的，但搜索需要时间和精力，实际上存在许多相互交织的非货币成本（如时间成本、认知成本、互动成本），而利益可能会因为误解和错误信息而受到损害。这种成本和利益的描述似乎与人类在追求某个更大任务中寻找信息的本质联系在一起：大多数成本和损害可以在任何网络搜索引擎的交互、公共图书馆的交互，甚至在与古代神谕的交互中找到。为了强调这种内在联系，我们将这些成本和利益称为Delphic，与明确的财务成本和利益形成对比。",
    "tldr": "新框架概念化和操作化了搜索的全面用户体验，其中强调了搜索中的Delphic成本和利益，包括非货币成本和可能受损的利益。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a new framework that analyzes the overall user experience of search by considering the utilitarian perspective. The study reveals the Delphic costs and benefits, including non-monetary costs and potential impairments, inherent in the search for information."
