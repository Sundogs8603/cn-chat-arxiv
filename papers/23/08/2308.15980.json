    "translated_abstract": "在顺序推荐中，多模态信息（如文本或图像）可以提供对物品特征更全面的观点。将模态特征融入物品表示的最佳阶段（早期或晚期）仍存在争议。我们提出了一种基于图的方法（名为MMSR），以自适应顺序融合模态特征，使每个模态可以优先考虑其固有的顺序特性或其与其他模态的相互作用。MMSR将每个用户的历史记录表示为一个图，其中用户历史序列中每个物品的模态特征由互相关联的节点表示。同质节点之间的边表示内部模态的顺序关系，异质节点之间的边表示模态之间的相互依赖关系。在图传播过程中，MMSR使用双重注意力区别对待同质和异质邻居。为了自适应地分配具有不同融合顺序的节点，MMSR允许每个节点的表示适应性地调整。",

The method uses a graph to represent a user's history and incorporates a dual attention mechanism to differentiate between homogeneous and heterogeneous neighbors, enabling adaptive adjustment of fusion order for each node."
