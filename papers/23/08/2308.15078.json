    "translated_abstract": "预计下一代边缘智能将为各种应用带来巨大的好处，例如卸载系统。然而，传统的深度卸载架构面临多个问题，包括异构限制、部分感知、不确定的泛化和缺乏可追溯性。在这种背景下，将卸载与大型语言模型（LLMs）集成在一起具有许多优势。因此，我们提出了一种基于LLM的卸载（LAMBO）框架，用于移动边缘计算（MEC），它由四个组成部分组成：（i）输入嵌入（IE），用于用高质量的可学习向量表示具有约束和提示的卸载系统的信息；（ii）非对称编码解码（AED）模型，是一个决策模块，具有深度编码器和浅层解码器。它可以基于多头自注意力机制实现高性能；（iii）演员-评论家强化学习（ACRL）模块，用于进行预训练。",
