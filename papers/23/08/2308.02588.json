    "translated_abstract": "鉴于目前缺乏可靠的生物标志物和有限的临床护理资源，帕金森病（PD）的诊断仍然具有挑战性。在本研究中，我们使用包含微表情的最大视频数据集进行PD筛查的分析。我们收集了来自1,059名独立参与者的3,871个视频，其中包括256名自报PD患者。这些录像来自不同来源，包括多个国家的参与者家中、一家诊所和一个美国的PD护理机构。通过利用面部标志和行动单位，我们提取了与PD的一个主要症状Hypomimia（面部表情减少）相关的特征。在这些特征上训练的一组AI模型在保留数据上实现了89.7%的准确性和89.3%的接收者操作特性曲线下面积（AUROC），并且在性别和种族等人群子组上无可检测的偏见。进一步的分析揭示，仅通过微笑视频中的特征就可以获得可比较的准确性和AUROC值。",
