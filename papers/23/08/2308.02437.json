    "abstract": "Over many decades, research is being attempted for the removal of noise in the ambulatory EEG. In this respect, an enormous number of research papers is published for identification of noise removal, It is difficult to present a detailed review of all these literature. Therefore, in this paper, an attempt has been made to review the detection and removal of an noise. More than 100 research papers have been discussed to discern the techniques for detecting and removal the ambulatory EEG. Further, the literature survey shows that the pattern recognition required to detect ambulatory method, eye open and close, varies with different conditions of EEG datasets. This is mainly due to the fact that EEG detected under different conditions has different characteristics. This is, in turn, necessitates the identification of pattern recognition technique to effectively distinguish EEG noise data from a various condition of EEG data.",

    "translated_abstract": "多年来，一直致力于便携式脑电图中噪音的去除研究。在这方面，已经发布了大量的研究论文来识别噪音去除方法，但是详细回顾所有这些文献是困难的。因此，在本文中，我们试图综述噪音的检测和去除。我们讨论了100多篇研究论文，以识别检测和去除便携式脑电图的技术。进一步的文献综述表明，用于检测便携式脑电图的模式识别方法，比如眼睛闭合和睁开状态，因脑电图的条件不同而异。这主要是由于不同条件下检测到的脑电图具有不同的特征。因此，必须确定一种模式识别技术，以有效地区分脑电图噪音数据和各种脑电图数据的条件。",
