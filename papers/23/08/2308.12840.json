    "translated_abstract": "通过我们的呼吸系统，许多病毒和疾病经常在人与人之间传播。COVID-19是一个示例，展示了追踪和减少接触以阻止病毒传播的重要性。在寻找能够在复杂的城市场景或室内检测手与脸接触的自动方法方面存在明显的差距。在本文中，我们引入了一个基于深度学习的计算机视觉框架，名为FaceTouch。它包括了用于检测人体和分析其动作的深度子模型。FaceTouch旨在检测野外环境中的手与脸接触，例如视频聊天、公交车摄像头或闭路电视。尽管面部部分遮挡，该系统通过利用场景的RGB表示以及身体手势（如手臂运动）的表示学习检测面部接触。这已经在复杂的城市场景中证明了对于仅仅识别手的移动和其与脸的接近之外的实用性。在监督对比学习的基础上。",
