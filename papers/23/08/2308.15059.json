    "translated_abstract": "关系数据集在现实世界中非常普遍，并且通常以数据流的方式传递。这种类型的数据流可能存在一些特殊的挑战，例如分布漂移、异常值、新兴类别和特征变化，最近将这些挑战描述为机器学习中的开放环境挑战。虽然已经有一些关于数据流的增量学习的研究，但其评估主要是基于手动分割的数据集。此外，虽然有几个现实世界的数据流数据集可用，但这些开放环境挑战是否普遍存在以及现有的增量学习算法在真实数据集上的表现如何尚不确定。为了填补这个空白，我们开发了一个名为OEBench的开放环境基准，用于评估关系数据流中的开放环境挑战。具体而言，我们研究了55个真实世界的数据流数据集，并确立了开放环境场景在真实数据集中的普遍存在性，这在当前的研究中还没有被确定。",
