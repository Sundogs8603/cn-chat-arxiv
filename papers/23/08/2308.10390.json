    "translated_abstract": "虽然大型语言模型在许多领域和任务中展现出了可称赞的性能，但现有的语言模型在处理多模态功能方面仍存在明显不足，特别是对于需要语音和文本特征之间精确对齐和深度交互的口语问答（SQA）任务。为了解决LLM上的SQA挑战，我们从Librispeech创造了自由形式和开放式的LibriSQA数据集，包括自然对话格式的第一部分和包含多项选择题和答案以及分析片段的第二部分。这两部分共包含107k个涵盖各种主题的SQA对。鉴于现有语音-文本LLM的明显匮乏，我们提出了一个轻量级的端到端框架，在LibriSQA上执行SQA任务，并取得了显著的结果。通过将ASR改为SQA格式，我们进一步证实了我们框架处理ASR任务的能力。",
