    "abstract": "In this work, we provide a comprehensive survey of AI music generation tools, including both research projects and commercialized applications. To conduct our analysis, we classified music generation approaches into three categories: parameter-based, text-based, and visual-based classes. Our survey highlights the diverse possibilities and functional features of these tools, which cater to a wide range of users, from regular listeners to professional musicians. We observed that each tool has its own set of advantages and limitations. As a result, we have compiled a comprehensive list of these factors that should be considered during the tool selection process. Moreover, our survey offers critical insights into the underlying mechanisms and challenges of AI music generation.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们提供了一个全面的AI音乐生成工具的综述，包括研究项目和商业应用。为了进行我们的分析，我们将音乐生成方法分为三类：基于参数、基于文本和基于图像。我们的综述突出了这些工具的多样性和功能特点，适用于从普通听众到专业音乐人的各种用户。我们观察到每个工具都有自己的优点和局限性。因此，我们编制了一个全面的列表，列出了在选择工具过程中应考虑的这些因素。此外，我们的综述提供了关于AI音乐生成的底层机制和挑战的重要见解。",
