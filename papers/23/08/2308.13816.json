    "translated_abstract": "深度学习方法已经在分类和回归任务上展示出了卓越的性能，但是在表格数据上，经典机器学习方法往往比越来越复杂的深度学习架构更具计算效率且同样有效。这是因为表格数据中特征间的相关性比图像或自然语言的空间或语义关系要弱，而且需要在没有任何先验信息的情况下对依赖关系进行建模。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的深度学习架构，通过拓扑约束网络表示来利用数据的结构组织，从稀疏的表格数据中获取空间信息。所得模型利用了卷积的能力，并围绕网络拓扑中的有限概念来保证（i）数据一致性、（ii）表示有效性、和（iii）容量。我们在多个任务和数据集上进行了实验证明了该模型的有效性和泛化能力。",
