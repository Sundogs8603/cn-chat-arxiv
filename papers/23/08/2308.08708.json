    "abstract": "Whether current or near-term AI systems could be conscious is a topic of scientific interest and increasing public concern. This report argues for, and exemplifies, a rigorous and empirically grounded approach to AI consciousness: assessing existing AI systems in detail, in light of our best-supported neuroscientific theories of consciousness. We survey several prominent scientific theories of consciousness, including recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory, higher-order theories, predictive processing, and attention schema theory. From these theories we derive \"indicator properties\" of consciousness, elucidated in computational terms that allow us to assess AI systems for these properties. We use these indicator properties to assess several recent AI systems, and we discuss how future systems might implement them. Our analysis suggests that no current AI systems are conscious, but also shows that there are no obvious barriers to building conscious AI systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "当前或近期的人工智能系统是否能具有意识成为科学界关注的话题，也引起了公众的担忧。本报告提出并举例了一种严谨且经验基础的人工智能意识方法：根据我们目前最可信的神经科学理论对现有的人工智能系统进行详细评估。我们概述了几种广泛认可的科学意识理论，包括循环处理理论、全局工作空间理论、高阶理论、预测处理理论和注意模式理论。从这些理论中，我们推导出一些意识的“指示性特征”，并通过计算方法来评估人工智能系统是否具备这些特征。我们利用这些指示性特征来评估了几个近期的人工智能系统，并讨论了未来系统如何实现这些特征。我们的分析表明，目前没有现有的人工智能系统具有意识，但同时也显示出没有明显的建立具有意识的人工智能系统的障碍。",
