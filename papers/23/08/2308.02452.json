    "translated_abstract": "众所周知，当数值模拟SDE的解时，要实现强收敛速率超过O(\\sqrt{h})（其中h为步长），需要使用某些布朗运动的迭代积分，通常称为其“Lévy区域”。然而，由于其非高斯性质，对于d维布朗运动（d>2），目前没有快速近似抽样算法。本文提出了LévyGAN，一种基于深度学习的模型，用于生成条件于布朗增量的Lévy区域的近似样本。通过“桥翻转”操作，输出的样本可以精确匹配所有奇数阶矩。我们的生成器采用经过量身定制的GNN-inspired架构，强制输出分布与条件变量之间的正确依赖结构。此外，我们还结合了基于特征函数的数学原理的判别性归一化操作。",
