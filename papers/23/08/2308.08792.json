    "translated_abstract": "随着电动车（EVs）的普及，维持电网稳定性变成了一个重要的挑战。为了解决这个问题，已经开发了EV充电控制策略来管理EV的车—网（V2G）和网—车（G2V）模式之间的切换。在这种情况下，多智能体深度强化学习（MADRL）已经证明在EV充电控制中的有效性。然而，现有的基于MADRL的方法未能考虑EV充电/放电的自然功率流以及忽视驾驶员隐私。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新方法，将多EV充电/放电与在最佳功率流（OPF）下运行的径向分布式网络（RDN）相结合，以实时分配功率流。开发了一个数学模型来描述RDN负荷。将EV充电控制问题制定为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），以找到一种优化的充电控制策略，以实现负载平衡。",
