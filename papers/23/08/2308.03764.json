    "translated_abstract": "新兴技术自主卡车装配器(ATMA)是一种领导者-跟随者风格的车辆系统，利用连接和自动驾驶技术来增强交通基础设施维护中的安全性。然而，ATMA车辆与普通车辆之间的速度差异造成了移动瓶颈，降低了通行能力并增加了排队长度，进而导致额外的延误。ATMA采取不同路线导致了时间变化的不同容量降低模式，可能影响用户均衡交通分配并导致不同的系统成本。本文旨在优化ATMA车辆在网络中的路径规划，以最小化与慢速运行相关的系统成本。为此，提出了一种基于排队的交通分配方法来识别由ATMA系统引起的系统成本。引入了考虑容量降低的基于排队的时间相关(QBTD)行程时间函数。",
