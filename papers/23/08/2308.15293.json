    "translated_abstract": "图表示学习（GRL）已成为进一步理解复杂网络的重要工具，提供了网络嵌入、链接预测和节点分类的技巧。在本文中，我们提出了混合成员-潜在距离模型（HM-LDM），通过探索如何将潜在距离模型（LDM）限制在一个潜在的单纯形上。通过控制单纯形角点的边长，可以系统地控制潜在空间的体积。随着空间越来越受限，社区将被揭示出来，当单纯形体积趋近于零时，也可以恢复硬成员关系。我们进一步探索了一种最近针对有符号网络的似然函数公式，利用Skellam分布考虑了有符号加权网络，并将HM-LDM扩展到有符号混合成员-潜在距离模型（sHM-LDM）。重要的是，引导似然函数明确地吸引那些具有正链接的节点，并阻止节点具有负链接。",
