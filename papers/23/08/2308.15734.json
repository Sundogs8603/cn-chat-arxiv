    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）是在各个领域进行数据科学任务的强大工具。尽管我们在广泛的应用场景中使用GNNs，但对研究人员和实践者来说，在不同的图中设计/选择最佳GNN架构是一项费力的任务。为了节省人力和计算成本，已经使用图神经网络架构搜索（Graph NAS）来搜索结合现有组件的次优GNN架构。然而，目前没有现有的Graph NAS方法能够同时满足可解释性、高效性和适应多样化图形的要求。因此，我们提出了一种高效且可解释的Graph NAS方法，称为ExGNAS，它包括（i）一个可以适应各种图形的简单搜索空间和（ii）一个能够解释决策过程的搜索算法。搜索空间仅包含可以处理同质和异质图的基本函数。搜索算法通过蒙特卡洛树搜索高效地搜索最佳GNN架构。",
