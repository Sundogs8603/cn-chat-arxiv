    "abstract": "Cataract surgery is a frequently performed procedure that demands automation and advanced assistance systems. However, gathering and annotating data for training such systems is resource intensive. The publicly available data also comprises severe imbalances inherent to the surgical process. Motivated by this, we analyse cataract surgery video data for the worst-performing phases of a pre-trained downstream tool classifier. The analysis demonstrates that imbalances deteriorate the classifier's performance on underrepresented cases. To address this challenge, we utilise a conditional generative model based on Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) and Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). Our model can synthesise diverse, high-quality examples based on complex multi-class multi-label conditions, such as surgical phases and combinations of surgical tools. We affirm that the synthesised samples display tools that the classifier recognises. These samples are hard to differentiate from real i",

    "translated_abstract": "白内障手术是一个经常进行的需要自动化和先进辅助系统的程序。然而，收集和标注用于训练这些系统的数据是资源密集型的。公开可用的数据也包含手术过程中固有的严重不平衡。受此启发，我们分析了白内障手术视频数据，针对预训练下游工具分类器的表现最差的阶段。分析表明，不平衡会使分类器在少数被低估的情况下的性能恶化。为了解决这个挑战，我们利用基于去噪扩散隐式模型（DDIM）和无分类器引导（CFG）的条件生成模型。我们的模型可以根据复杂的多类多标签条件（如手术阶段和手术工具组合）合成多样化、高质量的样本。我们确认合成的样本显示出分类器识别的工具。这些样本很难与真实样本区分开来。",
