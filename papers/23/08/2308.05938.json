    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了Segment Anything Model (SAM) 在食物图像分割中的零样本能力。为了解决SAM生成的掩膜中缺乏特定类别信息的问题，我们提出了一种新的框架，称为FoodSAM。这种创新的方法将粗糙的语义掩膜与SAM生成的掩膜结合起来，提高语义分割质量。此外，我们意识到食物中的成分可以被视为独立的个体，因此我们对食物图像进行了实例分割。此外，FoodSAM将其零样本能力扩展到全景分割，并结合了物体检测器，使FoodSAM能够有效捕捉非食物对象信息。受到提示分割的最近成功启发，我们还将FoodSAM扩展到了可提示分割，支持各种提示变体。因此，FoodSAM成为一个全面的解决方案，能够在多个层面上分割食物物品。",
