    "translated_abstract": "先进制造（AM）因其在核材料领域的潜在应用而引起了核社区的广泛关注。一个挑战是通过在运行时控制制造过程来获得所需的材料性质。基于深度强化学习（DRL）的智能AM依赖于自动化的过程级控制机制，以生成用于改进最终产品性质的最佳设计变量和自适应系统设置。最近在爱达荷国家实验室（INL）的MOOSE框架中开发了一个用于直接能量沉积的高保真度热力机械模型。该工作的目标是为这个基于MOOSE的AM模型开发一个准确且运行速度快的降阶模型（ROM），以便在基于DRL的过程控制和优化方法中使用。由于它们能够学习一族由改变的过程变量产生的微分方程，因此将采用基于运算符学习（OL）的方法。",
