So, being healthy requires heathy diet plans, especially for patients with comorbidities. But it is difficult to figure out the exact quantity of each nutrient because nutrients requirement varies based on physical and disease conditions. In our study we proposed a novel machine learning based system to predict the amount of nutrients one individual requires for being healthy. We applied different machine learning algorithms: linear regression, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM on fluid and 3 other major micronutrients: carbohydrate, protein, fat consumption prediction. We achieved high accuracy with low root mean square error (RMSE) by using linear regression in fluid prediction, random forest in carbohydrate prediction and LightGBM in protein and fat prediction.

    "translated_abstract": "肥胖是许多非传染性疾病的主要原因，主要是因为摄入超过身体需求和缺乏适当的活动。因此，保持健康需要健康的饮食计划，特别是对于患有共病的患者。但是，要确定每种营养物质的确切数量是困难的，因为营养物质的需求根据身体和疾病的情况而变化。在我们的研究中，我们提出了一种基于机器学习的新颖系统，用于预测一个人保持健康所需的营养物质的数量。我们应用了不同的机器学习算法：线性回归、支持向量机（SVM）、决策树、随机森林、XGBoost、LightGBM在流体和3种其他主要微量营养素（碳水化合物、蛋白质、脂肪）的消耗预测上。我们使用线性回归在流体预测中获得了高准确性和低均方根误差（RMSE），使用随机森林在碳水化合物预测中，使用LightGBM在蛋白质和脂肪预测中取得了高准确性和低均方根误差（RMSE）。我们认为我们的饮食推荐器会对肥胖管理有重要贡献。",
