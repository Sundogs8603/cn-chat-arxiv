    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们介绍了DiffuseStyleGesture+，这是我们对于《GENEA Challenge 2023》的解决方案，该挑战旨在促进生成会话手势的现实、自动化系统的开发。参与者将获得一个经过预处理的数据集，并通过众包评分来评估其系统。我们提出的模型DiffuseStyleGesture+利用扩散模型自动生成手势。它结合了多种模态，包括音频、文本、说话者身份和种子手势。这些多样的模态被映射到一个隐藏空间，并通过修改后的扩散模型进行处理，以针对给定的语音输入生成相应的手势。在评估中，DiffuseStyleGesture+展示了与挑战中顶级模型相媲美的性能，表现出与这些模型在人类类似性、适应对话者的合适性和实现达到无显著差异。",
