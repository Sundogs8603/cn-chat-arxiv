    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能系统在我们日常生活和人类社会中取得显著的性能，人们既享受到了这些技术带来的好处，也面临因这些系统而引发的许多社会问题。为了使人工智能系统足够好并且可信，已经进行了大量研究，建立了可信人工智能系统的指南。机器学习是人工智能系统中最重要的部分之一，而表示学习是机器学习中的基础技术。如何使表示学习在现实世界的应用中具有可信度，例如跨领域场景，对于机器学习和人工智能系统领域都是非常有价值和必要的。在可信人工智能的概念启发下，我们提出了第一个跨领域的可信表示学习框架，包括了鲁棒性、隐私、公平性和可解释性这四个概念，对这个研究方向进行了全面的文献综述。",
