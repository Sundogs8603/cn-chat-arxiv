In this study, we explore the generation of fast vision transformer architecture designs via generative architecture search (GAS) to achieve a strong balance between accuracy and architectural and computational efficiency. Through this generative architecture search process, we create TurboViT, a highly efficient hierarchical vision transformer architecture design that is generated around mask unit attention and Q-pooling design patterns.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，视觉变压器在处理各种视觉感知任务方面展示出了前所未有的性能水平。然而，这种网络架构的结构和计算复杂性使得它们在具有高吞吐量和低内存要求的实际应用中难以部署。因此，最近在有效视觉变压器架构设计方面进行了重要的研究。在本研究中，我们通过生成式架构搜索（GAS）探索了快速视觉变压器架构设计的生成，以实现在准确性和架构计算效率之间的良好平衡。通过这个生成式架构搜索过程，我们创建了 TurboViT，这是一种基于掩码单元注意力和 Q-pooling 设计模式的高效分层视觉变压器架构设计。该结果表明，TurboViT 架构设计的架构计算复杂性显著降低（>2.47）",
