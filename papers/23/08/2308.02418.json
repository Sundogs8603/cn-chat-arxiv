    "abstract": "This paper presents a gradient-based method for on-the-fly optimization for both per-frame and per-frequency window length of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), related to previous work in which we developed a differentiable version of STFT by making the window length a continuous parameter. The resulting differentiable adaptive STFT possesses commendable properties, such as the ability to adapt in the same time-frequency representation to both transient and stationary components, while being easily optimized by gradient descent. We validate the performance of our method in vibration analysis.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于梯度的方法，用于实时优化短时傅里叶变换（STFT）的帧间和频率间窗长，与我们之前开发的将窗长变为连续参数的可微分版本的STFT相关。生成的可微分自适应STFT具有出色的特性，例如在同一时频表示中适应瞬态和稳态成分，同时可以通过梯度下降轻松进行优化。我们在振动分析中验证了该方法的性能。",
