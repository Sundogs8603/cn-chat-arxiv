Although the existing ECAL DQM system has been continuously updated to respond to new problems, it remains one step behind newer and unforeseen issues. Using unsupervised deep learning, a real-time autoencoder-based anomaly detection system is developed that is able to detect ECAL anomalies unseen in past data. After accounting for spatial variations in the response of the ECAL and the temporal evolution of anomalies, the new system is able to efficiently detect anomalies while maintaining an estimated false discovery rate between $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$, beating existing benchmarks by about two orders of magnitude. The real-world performance of the system is validated using anomalies found in 2018 and 2022 L",
