As poor choices can have a significant impact on resource efficiency, cost, and energy usage, automated approaches are gaining popularity. Most existing methods rely on profiling recurring workloads to find near-optimal solutions over time. Due to the cold-start problem, this often leads to lengthy and costly profiling phases.

The potential in sharing aggregated profiling runs to collaboratively address the cold start problem is largely unexplored.

    "translated_abstract": "由于机器类型和集群规模等配置选项的广泛多样性，选择适合大数据分析作业的正确资源是困难的。由于糟糕的选择可能对资源效率、成本和能源使用产生重大影响，自动化方法越来越受欢迎。大多数现有方法依赖于对重复工作负载进行配置文件分析，以寻找接近最优解的解决方案。由于冷启动问题，这通常导致费时且昂贵的配置文件分析阶段。然而，不同用户的大数据分析作业可以共享许多共同特性：它们通常在类似的基础设施上操作，使用类似的算法在类似的框架中实现。共享聚合配置文件分析运行以协作解决冷启动问题的潜力还没有得到充分探索。我们提出了Karasu，一种促进在类似基础设施、框架、算法或数据集上工作的用户之间共享数据的更高效的资源配置配置文件分析方法。",
