    "translated_abstract": "胜者通吃（WTA）电路作为一种脉冲神经网络（SNN）被建议作为大脑以贝叶斯方式处理信息的能力的促进因素。研究表明，WTA电路能够通过期望最大化（EM）逼近分层贝叶斯模型。到目前为止，这个研究方向主要关注自下而上的过程，这与神经科学证据相矛盾，后者显示除了自下而上的过程外，自上而下的过程也在人脑的信息处理中发挥关键作用。自上而下的过程包括注意力的指向、对期望的调整、学习信息的编码和回忆的促进以及想象等。本文探讨了WTA电路是否适合进一步整合在不同WTA网络中表示的信息。此外，它还探讨了在什么情况下自上而下的过程能够提高WTA网络在推理方面的性能。",
