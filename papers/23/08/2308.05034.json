    "translated_abstract": "溯源图是描述系统执行历史的结构化审计日志。最近的研究探索了各种技术来分析溯源图，以实现自动化主机入侵检测，特别关注高级持久性威胁。通过研究其设计文档，我们确定了四个常见维度，推动溯源为基础的入侵检测系统（PIDS）的发展：范围（PIDS能否检测跨应用边界渗透的现代攻击？）、攻击不可知性（PIDS能否在没有攻击特征先验知识的情况下检测新型攻击？）、时效性（PIDS能否高效监视主机系统运行？）和攻击重建（PIDS能否从大型溯源图中提炼攻击活动，以便系统管理员能够轻松理解并迅速应对系统入侵？）。我们提出了KAIROS，这是第一个同时满足所有四个维度要求的PIDS，而现有的方法不能做到。",
