    "translated_abstract": "由大型语言模型（LLMs）赋能的自主智能体已经取得了显著进展，使它们能够在广泛的任务范围内进行泛化。然而，在现实世界的情境中，个体之间的合作经常需要以增强任务完成的效率和效果。因此，受到人类群体动力学的启发，我们提出了一个多智能体框架，可以作为一个大于其各个部分之和的系统进行协同和动态调整。我们的实验表明，这个框架能够有效地部署超过单个智能体的多智能体组，并取得更好的表现。此外，我们深入研究了在合作任务完成过程中，群体内个体智能体之间出现的社会行为的涌现。基于这些行为，我们讨论了一些可能的策略，以利用积极的行为，并减轻消极的行为，以提高多智能体组的协作潜力。我们的 \\framework 框架的代码将很快公布。",
