    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the contagion effects associated with the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and identifies bank-specific vulnerabilities contributing to the subsequent declines in banks' stock returns. We find that uninsured deposits, unrealized losses in held-to-maturity securities, bank size, and cash holdings had a significant impact, while better-quality assets or holdings of liquid securities did not help mitigate the negative spillovers. Interestingly, banks whose stocks performed worse post SVB also had lower returns in the previous year following Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. The stock market partially anticipated risks associated with uninsured deposit reliance, but did not price in unrealized losses due to interest rate hikes nor risks linked to bank size. While mid-sized banks experienced particular stress immediately after the SVB failure, over time negative spillovers became widespread except for the largest banks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了与硅谷银行（SVB）失败相关的传染效应，并确定了导致银行股票回报下降的特定脆弱性。我们发现，无保险存款、持有到期计提证券的未实现损失、银行规模和现金持有对后续负面溢出产生了显著影响，而高质量资产或持有流动性证券并未帮助减轻负面溢出。有趣的是，股票在硅谷银行发生后表现较差的银行在前一年联邦储备利率上调后也有较低的回报率。股市部分预期了与无保险存款的依赖相关的风险，但未计价由于利率上调而产生的未实现损失或与银行规模相关的风险。在硅谷银行失败后，中型银行立即遭受了特定压力，随着时间的推移，负面溢出变得普遍，除最大规模的银行外。",
