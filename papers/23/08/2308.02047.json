    "translated_abstract": "本文对欧洲委员会提议的AI法案中的风险管理和风险可接受性方法进行了批判性评估，该法案针对对基本权利和安全构成风险的高风险AI系统。该法案旨在推广“可信赖”的AI，并承担相称的监管负担。其关于风险可接受性的规定要求尽可能减少或消除高风险系统的残余风险，考虑“技术水平”。特别是如果狭义解释，这个标准是行不通的，既不促进相称的监管负担，也不促进可信赖性。相比之下，议会对风险管理规定最近的草案修改引入了“合理性”、成本效益分析，并对风险可接受性判断的价值取向和情境性质更加透明。本文认为议会的方法更具可行性，更能平衡相称性和可信赖性的目标。解释了议会的方法如何环绕风险管理的不同方面进行。",
