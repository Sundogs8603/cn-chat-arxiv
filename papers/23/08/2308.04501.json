    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们首次使用新兴的物理信息神经网络（PINNs）方法来预测压缩机叶栅的流场。该方法在一个二维问题上进行演示，同时结合正向和反向问题中的Navier-Stokes方程。在正向问题中，PINNs能够有效预测压缩机的流场。与深度神经网络（DNNs）相比，PINNs模型融合了相关量之间的物理关系，从而得到更精确的预测结果。在没有部分边界条件的情况下，PINNs在处理反向问题时显示出显著优势。PINNs仅基于部分速度向量和壁压信息成功重构了压缩机叶栅的流场。该研究提供了有力的证据，证明PINNs为涡轮机械设计人员提供了一种有前景的替代方法，取代了当前主导的CFD方法。",
