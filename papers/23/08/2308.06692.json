    "translated_abstract": "半监督图像分类是计算机视觉中最基本的问题之一，它显著减少了对人力的需求。本文引入了一种新的半监督学习算法 - SimMatchV2，它从图的角度建立了标记和未标记数据之间的一致性约束。在SimMatchV2中，我们将样本的增强视图视为一个节点，其中包含一个标签和其相应的表示。不同的节点通过节点表示的相似性连接起来。受到图论中的消息传递和节点分类的启发，我们提出了四种类型的一致性约束，分别为1) 节点-节点一致性，2) 节点-边一致性，3) 边-边一致性和4) 边-节点一致性。我们还发现简单的特征归一化可以减小不同增强视图之间特征范数的差距，从而显著提高SimMatchV2的性能。",
