    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了基于机器学习的个体治疗效果预测推理问题。以往的工作主要集中在开发能够提供条件平均治疗效果（CATE）的点估计的元学习器；这些方法是把中间的无关要素估计集合起来产生CATE估计的模型无关方法。在本文中，我们开发了一种一致性元学习器，这是一个通用框架，通过在CATE元学习器之上应用标准的一致性预测（CP）程序来生成个体治疗效果的预测区间。我们关注基于两阶段伪结果回归的广泛类别的元学习器，并开发了一个随机排序的框架来研究其有效性。我们证明了一致性元学习器的推理在其（伪结果）一致性得分在未观察到的个体治疗效果上随机优于oracle一致性得分时是边际有效的。此外，我们证明了常用的CATE元学习器...",
