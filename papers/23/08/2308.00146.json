    "abstract": "Node classification is one of the core tasks on attributed graphs, but successful graph learning solutions require sufficiently labeled data. To keep annotation costs low, active graph learning focuses on selecting the most qualitative subset of nodes that maximizes label efficiency. However, deciding which heuristic is best suited for an unlabeled graph to increase label efficiency is a persistent challenge. Existing solutions either neglect aligning the learned model and the sampling method or focus only on limited selection aspects. They are thus sometimes worse or only equally good as random sampling. In this work, we introduce a novel active graph learning approach called DiffusAL, showing significant robustness in diverse settings. Toward better transferability between different graph structures, we combine three independent scoring functions to identify the most informative node samples for labeling in a parameter-free way: i) Model Uncertainty, ii) Diversity Component, and iii)",

    "translated_abstract": "节点分类是属性图上的核心任务之一，但成功的图学习解决方案需要足够标记的数据。为了降低注释成本，主动图学习专注于选择最具质量的节点子集，以最大化标签效率。然而，决定对一个未标记的图使用哪种启发式方法来增加标签效率，始终是一个持久的挑战。现有的解决方案要么忽视了学到的模型和采样方法的对齐，要么只关注有限的选择方面。因此，它们有时比随机采样更差，或者只能与随机采样一样好。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种新颖的主动图学习方法，称为DiffusAL，在不同场景中表现出显著的鲁棒性。为了在不同图结构之间实现更好的可迁移性，我们以无参数的方式结合了三个独立的评分函数，以识别最具信息的节点样本以进行标记：i) 模型不确定性，ii) 多样性组件，以及iii)",
