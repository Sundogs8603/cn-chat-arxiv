    "abstract": "With recent developments in deep learning, the ubiquity of micro-phones and the rise in online services via personal devices, acoustic side channel attacks present a greater threat to keyboards than ever. This paper presents a practical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning model in order to classify laptop keystrokes, using a smartphone integrated microphone. When trained on keystrokes recorded by a nearby phone, the classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%, the highest accuracy seen without the use of a language model. When trained on keystrokes recorded using the video-conferencing software Zoom, an accuracy of 93% was achieved, a new best for the medium. Our results prove the practicality of these side channel attacks via off-the-shelf equipment and algorithms. We discuss a series of mitigation methods to protect users against these series of attacks.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着深度学习的不断发展，麦克风的普及以及个人设备上在线服务的兴起，声学侧信道攻击对键盘构成了比以往更大的威胁。本文通过在智能手机集成的麦克风上实现了一种先进的深度学习模型，用于分类笔记本电脑的按键。当使用附近手机记录的按键进行训练时，分类器的准确率达到了95%，是在不使用语言模型的情况下所见到的最高准确率。当使用视频会议软件Zoom记录的按键进行训练时，准确率达到了93%，为该媒介的新纪录。我们的结果证明了通过现成设备和算法进行这些侧信道攻击的实用性。我们讨论了一系列缓解方法，以保护用户免受这些攻击的影响。",
