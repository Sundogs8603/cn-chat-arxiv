The score of a committee is determined using the well-known (min-max) Chamberlin-Courant rule: minimize the maximum distance between any voter and its closest candidate in the committee.

    "translated_abstract": "在委员会选举问题中，目标是从候选人集合C中选择一个大小为k的子集，以确保给选民集合提供最佳的代表性。我们在欧几里得d-空间中考虑这个问题，其中每个选民/候选人都是一个点，选民的偏好通过与候选人的欧几里得距离隐式表示。我们研究了委员会选举中的容错性，并研究了以下三个变种：(1)给定一个委员会和一组f个失败的候选人，找到它们的最佳替代者；(2)计算在f个候选人失败的情况下，给定委员会的最坏替代分数；(3)设计一个在最坏情况下失败时拥有最好替代分数的委员会。委员会的分数使用众所周知的（最小-最大）Chamberlin-Courant规则来确定：最小化委员会中任何选民与其最近候选人之间的最大距离。我们的主要结果包括以下内容：(1)在一维情况下，所有三个问题都可以求解。",
