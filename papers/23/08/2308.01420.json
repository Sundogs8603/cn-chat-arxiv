However, popular algorithms for dimensionality reduction of text corpora, like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), often produce projections that do not capture human notions of document similarity. We propose a semi-supervised human-in-the-loop LDA-based method for learning topics that preserve semantically meaningful relationships between documents in low-dimensional projections. On synthetic corpora, our method yields more interpretable projections than baseline methods with only a fraction of labels provided. On a real corpus, we obtain qualitatively similar results.",

    "translated_abstract": "一种探索文本语料库的常见方法是通过文档的低维投影，希望主题相似的文档能够在投影空间中聚类在一起。然而，常用的用于降维文本语料库的算法，如潜在狄利克雷分配（LDA），往往会产生无法捕捉文档相似性的人类概念的投影。我们提出了一种半监督人类参与的基于LDA的方法来学习主题，在低维投影中保留语义上有意义的文档之间的关系。在合成语料库上，我们的方法比仅提供少量标签的基线方法产生更易解释的投影。在实际语料库上，我们获得了类似的结果。",
