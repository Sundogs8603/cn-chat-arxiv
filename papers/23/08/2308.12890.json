    "translated_abstract": "生成式大型语言模型(LLMs)的出现强调了准确和高效的提示方法的需求。LLMs经常应用于少样本学习(FSL)的情境中，这里任务只使用很少的训练数据执行。FSL在许多人工智能(AI)子领域中变得流行，包括用于健康的AI。罕见病影响人口的一小部分，在数据可用性受限的情况下 inherently 需要FSL技术，尽管人工数据收集和标注费时费力。在本文中，我们提出了模型投票提示(MVP)，这是一种用于改善FSL环境中LLM查询性能的灵活提示方法。MVP通过提示多个LLMs执行相同的任务，然后对生成的输出进行多数投票来实现。该方法在单次罕见病识别和分类任务中相对于任何单个模型在集成模型中实现了改进的结果。我们还发布了一个新颖的罕见病数据集用于FSL。",
