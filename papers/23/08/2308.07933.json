    "translated_abstract": "使用图片描述语音进行痴呆检测已经研究了30年。尽管有这么长的历史，先前的模型主要关注正常人和患有痴呆症的患者之间语音模式的差异，但没有直接利用图片信息。在本文中，我们提出了首个将图片和描述文本作为输入，并融入大型预训练图像文本对齐模型的痴呆检测模型。我们观察到痴呆样本和健康样本在文本与图片相关性以及图片的焦点区域方面存在差异。因此，我们认为这种差异可以用于提高痴呆检测的准确性。具体而言，我们使用文本与图片的相关性对样本的句子进行排序和过滤。我们还根据图片的焦点区域确定了话题，并根据焦点区域对句子进行分类。我们提出了三个先进模型进行预处理。",
