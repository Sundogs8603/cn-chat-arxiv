    "translated_abstract": "近年来，多模态预训练变换器的使用在视觉丰富文档理解方面取得了显著进展。然而，现有模型主要关注文本和图像等特征，忽视了文本节点之间布局关系的重要性。在本文中，我们提出了GraphLayoutLM，一种新颖的文档理解模型，它利用布局结构图的建模将文档布局知识注入模型中。GraphLayoutLM利用图重排序算法，根据图结构调整文本序列。此外，我们的模型使用了一个布局感知的多头自注意力层来学习文档布局知识。所提出的模型能够理解文本元素的空间排列，提高文档理解能力。我们在FUNSD、XFUND和CORD等多个基准测试集上评估了我们的模型，并在这些数据集中取得了最先进的结果。我们的实验结果证明了模型的优越性能。",
