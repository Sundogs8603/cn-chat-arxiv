    "translated_abstract": "厚的双边配对平台，如房屋租赁市场，面临着向用户展示相关物品以降低搜索成本的挑战。许多平台使用排序算法来确定向用户展示备选项的顺序。排序算法可能依赖于简单的标准，如列表在平台上存在的时间长短，或者包含更复杂的方面，如关于用户偏好的个性化推断。利用一个房屋租赁平台的丰富数据，我们展示了排序算法可以成为不必要拥塞的来源，尤其是在排序对用户不变的情况下。不变的排序导致用户在我们研究的平台上查看、点击和请求相同的房间，极大地限制了该平台所产生的匹配数。我们估计了用户偏好，并模拟了在不同排序算法下的反事实情景，改变了个性化程度和用户之间的差异。在我们的案例中，增加个性化推断既提高了用户的匹配率，",
