    "translated_abstract": "医学图像分类模型通常使用来自多个数据源的训练数据集进行训练。虽然利用多个数据源对于实现模型的泛化至关重要，但必须承认，这些数据源的多样性本质上引入了意外的混淆因素和其他可能影响模型准确性和透明度的挑战。在医学图像分类中一个显著的混淆因素，特别是在肌骨图像分类中，是在青春期观察到的骨骼成熟引起的骨骼生长。我们使用COVID-19胸部X射线数据集训练了一个深度学习模型，并展示了该数据集由于意外混淆区域可能导致错误相关性。基于解释的学习（XBL）是一种深度学习方法，通过利用模型解释来交互式地消除错误相关性，使其超越了可解释性。这是通过整合交互式用户反馈、精确的region-of-interest逐渐消褪等方法来实现的。",
