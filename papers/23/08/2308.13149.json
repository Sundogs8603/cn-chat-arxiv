    "translated_abstract": "最近，使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行科学研究引起了越来越多的关注。已经提出了许多基准来评估LLMs在科学研究中的能力。然而，目前的基准主要基于预先收集的客观问题。这种设计存在数据泄漏问题，并且缺乏对主观问答能力的评估。在本文中，我们提出了SciEval，这是一个综合、多学科的评估基准，以解决这些问题。基于布鲁姆的分类法，SciEval涵盖了四个维度来系统评估科学研究能力。特别地，我们设计了一个基于科学原理的“动态”子集，以防止评估出现潜在的数据泄漏。SciEval包含了客观和主观问题。这些特点使SciEval成为评估LLMs科学研究能力的更有效的基准。对最先进的LLMs进行了全面实验，结果显示，尽管GPT-4取得了较高的得分，但在某些方面仍存在挑战。",
