To address these issues, we propose a Bi-directional Multi-hop Inference Model (BMIM) that leverages a feature selection network and a bi-directional multi-hop inference network to iteratively extract and integrate rich sentiment and act clues in a bi-directional manner. We also employ contrastive learning and dual learning to explicitly model the correlations of sentiment and act labels. Our experiments on two widely-used datasets show that BMIM outperforms s",

    "translated_abstract": "对话情感分类（DSC）和行为识别（DAR）的联合任务旨在同时预测对话中每个话语的情感标签和行为标签。然而，当前的方法只能单向编码对话上下文，限制了其对上下文的全面理解能力。此外，这些方法忽视了情感和行为标签之间的显式关联，导致对丰富的情感和行为线索的获取能力不足，从而阻碍了有效和准确的推理。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种双向多跳推理模型（BMIM），它利用特征选择网络和双向多跳推理网络来迭代地提取和整合丰富的情感和行为线索。我们还采用对比学习和双学习来明确建模情感和行为标签之间的关联。我们在两个广泛使用的数据集上的实验证明，BMIM的性能优于当前方法。",
