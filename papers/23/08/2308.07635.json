    "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in developing LLMs for medical diagnosis to improve diagnosis efficiency. Despite their alluring technological potential, there is no unified and comprehensive evaluation criterion, leading to the inability to evaluate the quality and potential risks of medical LLMs, further hindering the application of LLMs in medical treatment scenarios. Besides, current evaluations heavily rely on labor-intensive interactions with LLMs to obtain diagnostic dialogues and human evaluation on the quality of diagnosis dialogue. To tackle the lack of unified and comprehensive evaluation criterion, we first initially establish an evaluation criterion, termed LLM-specific Mini-CEX to assess the diagnostic capabilities of LLMs effectively, based on original Mini-CEX. To address the labor-intensive interaction problem, we develop a patient simulator to engage in automatic conversations with LLMs, and utilize ChatGPT for evaluating diagnosis dialogues automatically.

    "translated_abstract": "在开发用于医学诊断的LLM（大型语言模型）以提高诊断效率方面引起了越来越多的兴趣。尽管它们具有吸引人的技术潜力，但缺乏统一和全面的评估标准导致无法评估医学LLMs的质量和潜在风险，进一步阻碍了LLMs在医疗治疗场景中的应用。此外，当前的评估严重依赖于与LLMs进行劳动密集型的交互以获取诊断对话和人工评估诊断对话的质量。为了解决缺乏统一和全面评估标准的问题，我们首先根据原始的Mini-CEX建立了一个评估标准，称为LLM-specific Mini-CEX，以有效评估LLMs的诊断能力。为了解决劳动密集型交互问题，我们开发了一个患者模拟器与LLMs自动进行对话，并利用ChatGPT自动评估诊断对话。",
