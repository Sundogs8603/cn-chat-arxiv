    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable and prevalent, and can be used to produce creative content. The quality of content is influenced by the prompt used, with more specific prompts that incorporate examples generally producing better results. On from this, it could be seen that using instructions written for crowdsourcing tasks (that are specific and include examples to guide workers) could prove effective LLM prompts. To explore this, we used a previous crowdsourcing pipeline that gave examples to people to help them generate a collectively diverse corpus of motivational messages. We then used this same pipeline to generate messages using GPT-4, and compared the collective diversity of messages from: (1) crowd-writers, (2) GPT-4 using the pipeline, and (3 & 4) two baseline GPT-4 prompts. We found that the LLM prompts using the crowdsourcing pipeline caused GPT-4 to produce more diverse messages than the two baseline prompts. We also discuss implications from messages ",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）的能力越来越强大，已经被广泛应用于生成创意内容。内容的质量受到所使用的提示的影响，更具体且包含示例的提示通常能产生更好的结果。在此基础上，可以看出使用为众包任务编写的指令（具体且包含示例以指导工作者）可能成为有效的LLM提示。为了探索这一点，我们使用之前的众包流程，为人们提供示例来帮助生成一个具有多样性的激励信息语料库。之后，我们使用相同的流程使用GPT-4生成信息，并比较了来自以下不同提示的信息的多样性：（1）众包写手，（2）使用该流程的GPT-4，以及（3和4）两个基准GPT-4提示。我们发现使用众包流程的LLM提示导致GPT-4生成比两个基准提示更多样化的信息。我们还讨论了信息的意义。",
