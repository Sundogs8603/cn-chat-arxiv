    "abstract": "We present ToddlerBERTa, a BabyBERTa-like language model, exploring its capabilities through five different models with varied hyperparameters. Evaluating on BLiMP, SuperGLUE, MSGS, and a Supplement benchmark from the BabyLM challenge, we find that smaller models can excel in specific tasks, while larger models perform well with substantial data. Despite training on a smaller dataset, ToddlerBERTa demonstrates commendable performance, rivalling the state-of-the-art RoBERTa-base. The model showcases robust language understanding, even with single-sentence pretraining, and competes with baselines that leverage broader contextual information. Our work provides insights into hyperparameter choices, and data utilization, contributing to the advancement of language models.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了ToddlerBERTa，这是一个类似于BabyBERTa的语言模型，并通过五种不同的具有不同超参数的模型来探索其能力。在BLiMP，SuperGLUE，MSGS和BabyLM挑战中进行评估，我们发现较小的模型在特定任务上表现出色，而较大的模型在大量数据方面表现良好。尽管在较小的数据集上训练，ToddlerBERTa展示了令人称赞的性能，与最先进的RoBERTa-base相媲美。该模型展示了强大的语言理解能力，即使是在单句预训练的情况下，也能与利用更广泛上下文信息的基线竞争。我们的工作为超参数选择和数据利用提供了洞察，并为语言模型的发展做出了贡献。",
