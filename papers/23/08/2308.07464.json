    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们重新审视了约翰娜·德鲁克(Johanna Drucker)十年前提出的“是否存在数字艺术史？”这个问题，这是基于大规模的、基于transformer的视觉模型的出现之后的。虽然传统型神经网络早已成为数字艺术史的一部分，数字人文项目最近开始使用transformer模型，但它们的认识论影响和方法学可负担性尚未得到系统化的分析。我们将分析重点放在两个主要方面，这两个方面共同表明了向德鲁克所说的“数字”艺术史的一种新的范式转变的趋势。一方面，大规模视觉模型中新编码的视觉文化代表作品对数字艺术史产生了巨大影响。包含大量非摄影影像使得可以提取和自动化不同形式的视觉逻辑。大规模视觉模型“看到了”通过网络中介的西方视觉经典的大部分内容。",
    "tldr": "该论文重点探讨了数字艺术史的存在与发展，并指出大规模视觉模型对数字艺术史具有重要影响，打开了提取和自动化视觉逻辑的新可能性。",
