    "translated_abstract": "视觉识别模型容易学习到由于训练集的不平衡导致的相关性错误，其中某些群体（如女性）在某些类别（如程序员）中代表性不足。生成模型通过为少数样本生成合成数据来减少这种偏差，从而平衡训练集。然而，先前使用这些方法的工作忽视了视觉识别模型往往能够学习区分真实图像和合成图像的能力，因此无法消除原始数据集中的偏差。在我们的工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的两阶段流程来减少这个问题，其中1）我们在平衡的合成数据集上进行预训练，然后2）在真实数据上进行微调。使用这个流程，我们避免了在真实数据和合成数据上的训练，从而避免了真实数据和合成数据之间的偏差。此外，在第一步中我们学习到了抵抗偏差的稳健特征，在第二步中减轻了偏差。",
