    "translated_abstract": "高频量化投资是股票投资的重要方面。特别是订单流数据在高频交易数据中起着关键作用，因为它提供了最详细的信息，包括订单簿和逐笔交易记录的全面数据。订单流数据对市场分析非常有价值，因为它为交易者提供了必要的洞察力，帮助他们做出明智的决策。然而，由于涉及到大量的数据和传统因子挖掘技术的局限性，订单流数据的提取和有效利用存在挑战，这些技术主要是为粗粒度股票数据设计的。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一个新的框架，旨在从订单流数据中有效提取关键因子，用于不同粒度和场景的多样化下游任务。我们的方法包括一个上下文编码器和一个因子提取器。上下文编码器学习一个嵌入f",
