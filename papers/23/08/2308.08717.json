    "abstract": "Real-time video analytics on edge devices for changing scenes remains a difficult task. As edge devices are usually resource-constrained, edge deep neural networks (DNNs) have fewer weights and shallower architectures than general DNNs. As a result, they only perform well in limited scenarios and are sensitive to data drift. In this paper, we introduce EdgeMA, a practical and efficient video analytics system designed to adapt models to shifts in real-world video streams over time, addressing the data drift problem. EdgeMA extracts the gray level co-occurrence matrix based statistical texture feature and uses the Random Forest classifier to detect the domain shift. Moreover, we have incorporated a method of model adaptation based on importance weighting, specifically designed to update models to cope with the label distribution shift. Through rigorous evaluation of EdgeMA on a real-world dataset, our results illustrate that EdgeMA significantly improves inference accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "边缘设备上实时视频分析面对场景变化仍然是一项困难的任务。由于边缘设备的资源通常有限，边缘深度神经网络（DNN）相比一般的DNN具有更少的权重和较浅的架构。因此，它们只在有限的场景中表现良好，并对数据漂移敏感。本文介绍了EdgeMA，一种实用高效的视频分析系统，旨在适应实际场景下视频流随时间变化的模型，解决数据漂移问题。EdgeMA提取基于灰度共生矩阵的统计纹理特征，并使用随机森林分类器检测领域漂移。此外，我们还融入了一种基于重要性加权的模型适应方法，专门设计用于更新模型以应对标签分布的变化。通过对一个真实数据集对EdgeMA进行了严格评估，结果表明EdgeMA显著提高了推理准确性。",
