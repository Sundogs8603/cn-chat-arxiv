    "translated_abstract": "大量的关键绩效指标(KPI)以多变量时间序列数据(MTS)的形式进行监测，以确保软件应用程序和服务系统的可靠性。准确检测MTS的异常对于后续的故障排除非常关键。异常的稀缺性和手动标记导致了各种自监督的MTS异常检测方法的发展，这些方法优化了一个涵盖所有指标回归目标/损失的整体目标/损失。然而，我们的实证研究发现了指标回归目标之间冲突的普遍存在，导致MTS模型在不同的损失中挣扎。这一关键方面显著影响检测性能，但在现有方法中被忽视了。为了解决这个问题，通过模仿多门专家混合模型(MMoE)的设计，我们引入了CAD，一种冲突感知的多变量KPI异常检测算法。CAD为每个指标提供了一个独特的结构，以缓解冲突。",
