Existing works usually train the specific retriever or summarizer to obtain key information from the past, which is time-consuming and highly depends on the quality of labeled data.

Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and following contexts. Finally, the LLM can easily generate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method using ChatGPT and text-davinci-003, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long-context conversation.

    "translated_abstract": "大多数开放领域的对话系统在长期对话中容易遗忘重要信息。现有方法通常训练特定的检索器或总结器从过去获取关键信息，这需要耗费时间且高度依赖标记数据的质量。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出使用大型语言模型（LLMs）递归生成总结/记忆，以增强长期记忆能力。具体而言，我们的方法首先刺激LLMs记住小对话上下文，然后递归地使用之前的记忆和随后的对话内容产生新的记忆。最后，LLM可以在最新记忆的帮助下轻松生成高度一致的响应。我们使用ChatGPT和text-davinci-003进行评估，对广泛使用的公共数据集进行的实验证明我们的方法在长对话中可以生成更一致的响应。值得注意的是，我们的方法是实现LLM建模的潜在解决方案。",
