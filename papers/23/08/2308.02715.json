Moreover, predicting fluid properties purely from vision can accelerate the process of fluid characterization saving considerable time and effort in various experimental environments. In this work, we present a purely vision-based approach to estimate viscosity, leveraging the fact that the behavior of the fluid oscillations is directly related to the viscosity. Specifically, we utilize a 3D convolutional autoencoder to learn latent representations of different fluid-oscillating patterns present in videos. We leverage this latent representation to visually infer the category of fluid or the dynamics viscosity of fluid from video.",
