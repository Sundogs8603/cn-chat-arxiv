    "abstract": "The expected goal models have gained popularity, but their interpretability is often limited, especially when trained using black-box methods. Explainable artificial intelligence tools have emerged to enhance model transparency and extract descriptive knowledge for a single observation or for all observations. However, explaining black-box models for a specific group of observations may be more useful in some domains. This paper introduces the glocal explanations (between local and global levels) of the expected goal models to enable performance analysis at the team and player levels by proposing the use of aggregated versions of the SHAP values and partial dependence profiles. This allows knowledge to be extracted from the expected goal model for a player or team rather than just a single shot. In addition, we conducted real-data applications to illustrate the usefulness of aggregated SHAP and aggregated profiles. The paper concludes with remarks on the potential of these explanations",

    "translated_abstract": "预期进球模型的解释性通常有限，尤其是在使用黑盒方法进行训练时。随着解释性人工智能工具的出现，可以增强模型的透明度，并从单个观察或所有观察中提取描述性知识。然而，在某些领域中，解释特定群体观察的黑盒模型可能更有用。本文通过提出使用SHAP值和部分依赖函数的聚合版本，引入预期进球模型的全局解释（介于本地和全局之间的解释）来实现对团队和球员水平的绩效分析。这样可以从预期进球模型中提取与球员或球队相关的知识，而不仅仅是单个射门。另外，我们进行了实际数据应用来说明聚合SHAP值和聚合函数的有用性。本文最后对这些解释的潜力进行了评论。",
