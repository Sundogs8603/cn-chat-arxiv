    "translated_abstract": "在计算语言学中，自动将作者的风格从其写作内容中分离出来是一个长期存在且可能不可解决的问题。同时，最近有大量带有作者标签的文本语料库可用，使得以纯数据驱动的方式学习作者身份表征成为可能，用于作者归属这一任务，该任务显然更多地依赖于编码写作风格而不是编码内容。然而，对这一替代任务的成功并不能确保这些表征能够捕捉写作风格，因为作者身份也可能与其他潜在变量（如主题）相关。为了更好地理解这些表征所传递的信息的本质，特别是为了验证其主要编码的是写作风格的假设，我们通过一系列有针对性的实验系统地检查了这些表征。这些实验的结果表明，为作者表示学习的表征能够有效地捕捉写作风格的特征。",
