    "translated_abstract": "作物产量和收获价格常常被认为是负相关的，因此通过稳定收益来作为自然风险管理对冲。储存理论认为，该相关性是从前几年的库存中得出的一个递增函数。储存条件下的二阶矩对于短缺期间的价格波动和对冲需求具有影响，而空间上变化的产量-价格相关结构对于谁从商品支持政策中受益具有影响。在本文中，我们提出使用惩罚B样条的半参数分位回归（SQR）来估计储存条件下的产量和价格的联合分布。通过全面的模拟研究验证的提出方法，允许使用SQR从真实的联合分布中抽样。然后，将其应用于估计美国玉米和大豆的储存条件下的相关性和收益保险费用。对于这两种作物，Cornbelt c",
