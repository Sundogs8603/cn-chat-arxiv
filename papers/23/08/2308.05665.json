Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), we developed and trained a deep learning model for predicting person and vehicle trips. The proposed model leverages the vast amount of information in the NHTS data, capturing complex, non-linear relationships that were previously overlooked by traditional models.

    "translated_abstract": "现代交通规划在准确预测人员和车辆出行方面依赖较多。然而，传统规划模型往往无法考虑出行行为的复杂性和动态性，导致预测准确性不佳。本研究探讨了深度学习技术的潜力，以改变我们对出行预测和交通规划的方法。利用全国家庭出行调查（NHTS）的全面数据集，我们开发和训练了一个用于预测人员和车辆出行的深度学习模型。该模型利用NHTS数据中的大量信息，捕捉以前传统模型忽视的复杂非线性关系。结果，我们的深度学习模型在预测人员出行方面达到了98%的准确率，在车辆出行估计方面达到了96%的准确率。相比传统交通模型的表现，这代表了显著的提升。",
