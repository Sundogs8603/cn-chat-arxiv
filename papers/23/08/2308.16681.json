    "translated_abstract": "全球范围内的许多系统都利用算法决策来（部分）自动化以前由人类进行的决策。当设计良好时，这些系统承诺更客观的决策，同时节省大量资源，节约人力。然而，当算法决策系统设计不良时，可能会导致对社会群体进行歧视的不公平决策。算法决策系统的下游效应在很大程度上取决于系统设计和实施过程中的决策，因为数据中的偏见可能会在建模过程中缓解或加强。许多这些设计决策是隐含进行的，不知道它们确切地如何影响最终系统。因此，明确算法决策系统设计中的决策并了解这些决策如何影响结果系统的公平性非常重要。为了研究这个问题，我们借鉴了心理学领域的见解，并引入了多元宇宙分析方法。",
