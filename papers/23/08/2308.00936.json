    "translated_abstract": "速度限制（VL）广泛应用于许多粒子群优化（PSO）的变种中，以防止粒子在解空间之外进行搜索。已经引入了几种自适应VL策略，可以提高PSO的性能。然而，现有的自适应VL策略仅根据迭代次数调整VL，导致优化结果不理想，因为VL与粒子的当前搜索状态之间不兼容。为了解决这个问题，提出了一种新的基于状态的自适应速度限制策略的PSO变种（PSO-SAVL）。在提出的PSO-SAVL中，VL基于进化状态估计（ESE）自适应调整，其中为全局搜索状态设置较高的VL值，为局部搜索状态设置较低的VL值。此外，改进并采用了限制处理策略，以提高避免局部最优的能力。实验证明了PSO-SAVL的良好性能。",
