    "translated_abstract": "地中海贫血是一种遗传性血液病，由遗传缺陷导致血红蛋白多肽链的产生不足。然而，对这些地区的发病频率和共享程度的了解较少。了解地中海贫血发生的频率和可靠突变是预防、控制和治疗计划的重要一步。本文介绍了基于Political Tangent Search优化器的转移学习（PTSO_TL）在地中海贫血检测中的应用。首先，从特定数据集获取的输入数据在数据归一化阶段进行了规范化。数据归一化阶段利用分位数归一化方法，然后将数据传递给特征融合阶段，在该阶段利用Deep Maxout网络的加权欧氏距离进行特征融合。然后，使用过采样方法进行数据增强以增加数据维度。最后，通过转移学习进行地中海贫血检测。",
