    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱 (KG) 常被用作辅助信息，以增强协同信号并提高推荐质量。在知识感知推荐 (KGR) 的背景下，图神经网络 (GNN) 已成为对 KG 中的事实和语义信息进行建模的有前途的解决方案。然而，实体的长尾分布导致监督信号的稀疏性，这削弱了使用 KG 增强时的项目表示质量。此外，KG 的二元关系表示简化了超关系事实，使建模复杂的真实世界信息变得困难。此外，过度平滑的现象导致难以区分的表示和信息损失。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了基于超关系知识图的自监督动态超图推荐 (SDK) 框架。该框架建立了一个跨视图超图自监督学习机制来增强 KG。",
