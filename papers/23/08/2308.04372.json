A bipolar argument graph is a directed graph where each node denotes an argument, and each arc denotes the influence of one argument on another. Here we assume that the influence is supporting, attacking, or ambiguous. In a bipolar argument graph, each argument is atomic and so it has no internal structure. Yet to better understand the nature of the individual arguments, and how they interact, it is important to consider their internal structure. To address this need, this paper presents a framework based on the use of logical arguments to instantiate bipolar argument graphs, and a set of possible constraints on instantiating arguments that take into account the internal structure of the arguments, and the types of relationship between arguments.",

    "translated_abstract": "论证图提供了一种论证情境的抽象表示。双极论证图是一个有向图，其中每个节点表示一个论证，每个弧表示一个论证对另一个论证的影响。在双极论证图中，每个论证都是原子的，没有内部结构。然而，为了更好地理解个体论证的性质以及它们之间的相互作用，考虑它们的内部结构十分重要。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一个基于逻辑论证的框架，用于实例化双极论证图，并提供了一组可能的约束条件，考虑到论证的内部结构和论证之间的关系类型。",
