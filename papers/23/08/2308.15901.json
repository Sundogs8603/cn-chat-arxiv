    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）中的可解释性问题由于AI在我们的生活中几乎无处不在，以及AI系统的日益复杂而变得越来越受关注。答案集编程（ASP）在许多领域中被使用，其中包括工业优化、知识管理或生命科学，因此在可解释性的背景下具有极大的兴趣。为了确保ASP作为未来的问题解决范式的成功应用，研究ASP解决方案的解释至关重要。这样的解释试图回答为什么某个决策产生了或者为什么某个问题的解决方案是什么的问题。虽然目前存在一些ASP的解释方法，但几乎所有方法都缺乏对实践中使用的某些语言特性的支持。特别是，它们缺乏对近年来开发的用于在理论、外部通信等方面进行推理的各种ASP扩展的支持。",
