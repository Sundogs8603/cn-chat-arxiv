    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了是否可以利用对称性来防御基于树的集成分类器，例如梯度提升决策树(GBDT)，抵御对抗性扰动攻击。这个想法基于最近对卷积神经网络分类器(CNNs)使用对称性缺失来进行对称防御的研究。CNNs之所以缺乏对称性是因为它们可以对待对称样本（比如水平翻转的图像）进行不同于原始样本的分类。CNNs缺乏对称性也意味着CNNs可以对对称的对抗样本进行与对抗样本不同的分类。利用CNNs的缺乏对称性，最近的CNN对称防御已经显示对称对抗样本的分类恢复到了正确的样本分类。为了将相同的对称防御应用到GBDTs上，我们研究了GBDT的不变性，并首次证明GBDTs在对称性方面也缺乏不变性。",
