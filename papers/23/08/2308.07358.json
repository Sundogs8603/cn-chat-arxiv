    "translated_abstract": "计算流体力学在不同的工程领域广泛应用，但准确的模拟依赖于仿真域的适当网格划分。虽然高度精细的网格可以确保精度，但也带来了高计算成本。类似地，自适应重网格技术需要多次仿真，计算成本高。这意味着网格划分过程依赖于专业知识和多年的经验。自动化网格生成可以节省大量的时间和精力，并带来更快速和高效的设计过程。本文提出了一种基于机器学习的方案，利用图神经网络（GNN）和专家指导来自动生成飞机模型的计算流体力学网格。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种优于两个先进模型（PointNet++和PointMLP）的新的三维分割算法，用于表面分类。我们还提出了一种新颖的方法，用于从三维网格分割模型中投射预测结果。",
