    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，缺乏专门的训练数据的密集检索模型在各种检索任务中往往难以表现出色，因为不同的检索任务通常涉及不同的搜索意图。为解决这一挑战，在本工作中，我们引入了ControlRetriever，一种通用且高效的方法，采用参数隔离的架构，能够控制密集检索模型直接执行各种检索任务，发挥自然语言中明确描述检索意图的指令的力量。借助已在文本到图像生成中证明强大的ControlNet的基础，ControlRetriever将不同的检索模型赋予了可控性检索的新能力，同时还受到任务特定指令的指导。此外，我们提出了一种新颖的基于LLM引导的指令合成和迭代训练策略，通过广泛生成的检索数据迭代调整ControlRetriever。",
