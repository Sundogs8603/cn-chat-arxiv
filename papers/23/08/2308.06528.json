    "abstract": "One of the challenges in learning to perform abstract reasoning is that problems are often posed as monolithic tasks, with no intermediate subgoals. In Raven Progressive Matrices (RPM), the task is to choose one of the available answers given a context, where both contexts and answers are composite images featuring multiple objects in various spatial arrangements. As this high-level goal is the only guidance available, learning is challenging and most contemporary solvers tend to be opaque. In this study, we propose a deep learning architecture based on the transformer blueprint which, rather than directly making the above choice, predicts the visual properties of individual objects and their arrangements. The multidimensional predictions obtained in this way are then directly juxtaposed to choose the answer. We consider a few ways in which the model parses the visual input into tokens and several regimes of masking parts of the input in self-supervised training. In experimental assess",

    "translated_abstract": "学习进行抽象推理的挑战之一是问题通常被提出为整体任务，没有中间目标。在Raven渐进矩阵（RPM）中，任务是在给定上下文的情况下选择一个可用答案，其中上下文和答案都是复合图像，具有多个对象以及各种空间安排。由于只有这个高级目标作为指导，学习变得具有挑战性，大多数现代解决方案往往不透明。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于变形器蓝图的深度学习架构，该架构不直接进行上述选择，而是预测单个对象及其排列的视觉特性。通过这种方式获得的多维预测直接并置以选择答案。我们考虑了模型将视觉输入解析为令牌的几种方式，并采用了几种自监督训练中输入的屏蔽方法。",
