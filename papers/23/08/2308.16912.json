    "translated_abstract": "在高对比度成像中，检测和表征扩展结构是一个至关重要的目标。然而，这些结构在数据降噪方面面临挑战，导致了从散斑和自相减的过度减法以及大多数现有方法的光注入。迭代后处理方法提供了有希望的结果，但它们的集成到现有的流程中受到选择性算法、高计算成本和算法正则化的阻碍。为了解决这个问题，在参考差分成像（RDI）中，我们提出了以Karhunen-Lo\\`eve变换（DIKL）为基础的数据插值概念，通过修改标准Karhunen-Lo\\`eve图像投影（KLIP）方法中的两个步骤。具体而言，我们将图像分割为两个矩阵：一个锚定矩阵，仅关注散斑以获得DIKL系数，以及一个船型矩阵，专注于天体物理兴趣区域，使用DIKL成分进行散斑去除。作为一种分析方法，DIKL取得了高质量的结果，具有显著的效果。",
