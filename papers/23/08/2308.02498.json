    "abstract": "Noisy labels can significantly affect the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs). In medical image segmentation tasks, annotations are error-prone due to the high demand in annotation time and in the annotators' expertise. Existing methods mostly assume noisy labels in different pixels are \\textit{i.i.d}. However, segmentation label noise usually has strong spatial correlation and has prominent bias in distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov model for segmentation noisy annotations that encodes both spatial correlation and bias. Further, to mitigate such label noise, we propose a label correction method to recover true label progressively. We provide theoretical guarantees of the correctness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world noisy annotations.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络（DNNs）的性能通常会受到嘈杂标签的显著影响。在医学图像分割任务中，由于注释时间和注释者的专业知识的高需求，注释往往存在错误。现有方法大多假设不同像素点上的噪声标签是独立同分布的。然而，分割标签的噪声通常具有强烈的空间相关性和显著的分布偏差。本文提出了一种新的马尔可夫模型用于编码分割噪声注释中的空间相关性和偏差。为了减轻这种标签噪声，我们提出了一种标签修正方法逐步恢复真实标签。我们提供了所提方法正确性的理论保证。实验证明，我们的方法在合成和实际噪声注释上优于当前最先进的方法。",
