Impressions are a novel data source containing past recommendations (shown items) and traditional interactions. Researchers may use impressions to refine user preferences and overcome the current limitations in recommender systems research. The relevance and interest of impressions have increased over the years; hence, the need for a review of relevant work on this type of recommenders. We present a systematic literature review on recommender systems using impressions, focusing on three fundamental angles in research: recommenders, datasets, and evaluation methodologies. We provide three categorizations of papers describing recommenders using impressions, present each reviewed paper in detail, describe datasets with impressions, and analyze the existing evaluation methodologies.

    "translated_abstract": "新型数据源为改进推荐系统的质量带来了新的机遇。印象是一种包含过去推荐（展示的项目）和传统互动的新型数据源。研究人员可以利用印象来优化用户偏好并克服当前推荐系统研究中的限制。印象的相关性和兴趣度逐年增加，因此需要对这类推荐系统中相关工作进行综述。我们提出了一篇关于使用印象的推荐系统的系统文献综述，侧重于研究中的三个基本方面：推荐系统、数据集和评估方法。我们对使用印象的推荐系统的论文进行了三个分类，详细介绍了每篇综述论文，描述了具有印象的数据集，并分析了现有的评估方法。最后，我们提出了值得关注的开放性问题和未来的研究方向，强调了文献中缺失的方面。",
