    "translated_abstract": "显著目标检测（SOD）旨在识别和分割图像或视频中最显著的对象。随着成像设备的进步，对高分辨率图像的SOD需求日益迫切。然而，传统的SOD方法主要局限于低分辨率图像，并难以适应高分辨率SOD（HRSOD）的发展。尽管出现了一些HRSOD方法，但目前没有足够大的数据集用于训练和评估。此外，当前的HRSOD方法通常会产生不完整的对象区域和不规则的对象边界。为解决上述问题，我们首先提出了一个新的HRS10K数据集，其中包含10500个2K-8K分辨率的高质量注释图像。据我们所知，这是目前用于HRSOD任务的最大数据集，它将在很大程度上帮助未来的训练和评估工作。此外，为了改进方法，在本研究中，我们提出了一种循环多尺度Transformer网络",
