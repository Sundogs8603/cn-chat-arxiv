    "abstract": "Heart failure is a life-threatening condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The ability to accurately predict patient survival can aid in early intervention and improve patient outcomes. In this study, we explore the potential of utilizing data pre-processing techniques and the Extra-Tree (ET) feature selection method in conjunction with the Random Forest (RF) classifier to improve survival prediction in heart failure patients. By leveraging the strengths of ET feature selection, we aim to identify the most significant predictors associated with heart failure survival. Using the public UCL Heart failure (HF) survival dataset, we employ the ET feature selection algorithm to identify the most informative features. These features are then used as input for grid search of RF. Finally, the tuned RF Model was trained and evaluated using different matrices. The approach was achieved 98.33% accuracy that is the highest over the exiting work.",

    "translated_abstract": "心力衰竭是一种危及生命的疾病，全球数百万人受到影响。准确预测患者的生存能力可以帮助及早干预，并改善患者预后。本研究探讨利用数据预处理技术和Extra-Tree (ET) 特征选择方法与Random Forest (RF) 分类器相结合，以提高心力衰竭患者的生存预测能力的潜力。通过发挥ET特征选择的优势，我们的目标是识别与心力衰竭生存相关的最重要的预测因子。利用公开的UCL心力衰竭 (HF) 生存数据集，我们采用ET特征选择算法来识别最具信息量的特征。然后，将这些特征用作RF的网格搜索的输入。最后，使用不同的指标对调优后的RF模型进行训练和评估。所采用的方法取得了98.33%的准确率，是目前的最高水平。",
