We present the first set of experiments on the use of two fault injection means, electromagnetic and laser injections, applied on neural networks models embedded on a Cortex M4 32-bit microcontroller platform. Contrary to most of state-of-the-art works dedicated to the alteration of the internal parameters or input values, our goal is to simulate and experimentally demonstrate the impact of a specific fault model that is instruction skip.

    "translated_abstract": "随着神经网络模型的大规模集成和使用，特别是在关键的嵌入式系统中，对它们的安全评估以保证它们的可靠性变得迫切。尤其是部署在32位微控制器等嵌入式平台上的模型可以被对手物理访问，因此容易受到硬件干扰的攻击。我们提出了一系列关于在Cortex M4 32位微控制器平台上嵌入的神经网络模型上应用电磁和激光注入两种故障注入手段的实验。与大多数致力于改变内部参数或输入值的现有工作不同，我们的目标是模拟和实验性地展示一种特定的错误模型——指令跳过的影响。为了达到这个目的，我们对神经网络推理的控制流进行了数种修改攻击的评估。我们揭示了通过针对推理过程的多个步骤的攻击来威胁其完整性。",
