We leverage the cross-sectional and temporal hierarchical structure of turbines in wind farms and build cross-temporal hierarchies to further investigate how integrated cross-sectional and temporal dimensions can add value to forecast accuracy in wind farms.

    "translated_abstract": "可再生能源发电对全球减碳至关重要。预测可再生能源，特别是风能，具有挑战性，因为风能发电受气候条件的不确定性影响。最近通过协调实现的层次预测在短期内显著提高了风能预测的质量。我们利用风电场中风力发电机的横截面和时间层次结构，构建横时层次结构，进一步研究跨横截面和时间维度的整合如何增加风电场的预测准确性。我们发现，跨时间协调在多个时间汇总中优于单独跨横截面协调。此外，基于机器学习的跨时协调预测表现出对较粗时间聚合的高准确性。",
