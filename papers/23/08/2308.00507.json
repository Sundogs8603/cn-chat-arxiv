Besides, different from existing models that used CNNs or LSTMs to exploit tumor enhancement patterns on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT imaging, we improved the extraction of dynamic tumor-related texture features in multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT by fusing local and global features using CNN and transformer modules, further enhancing the features extracted across multi-phase CT images.

    "translated_abstract": "胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）是一种高度致命的癌症，肿瘤-血管受累极大影响患者的可切除性和总体生存率。然而，当前的预后预测方法未能明确准确地调查肿瘤与附近重要血管之间的关系。本文提出了一种新颖的可学习的神经距离，描述了不同患者CT影像中肿瘤与血管之间的精确关系，并将其作为预后预测的主要特征。此外，不同于现有模型在动态对比增强CT成像上利用CNN或LSTM来利用肿瘤增强模式，我们通过融合局部和全局特征使用CNN和变压器模块，在多相对比增强CT中改进了动态与肿瘤相关的纹理特征提取，进一步增强了跨多相CT影像提取的特征。我们对所提出的方法进行了广泛评估和比较。",
