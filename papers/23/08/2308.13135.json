    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种非参数可加模型，用于在强化学习中估计可解释的值函数。学习依靠数字表型特征的有效自适应临床干预是医务人员重视的问题。在脊柱手术方面，关于患者运动能力恢复的不同术后恢复建议可能会导致患者恢复程度的显著变化。虽然强化学习在游戏等领域取得了广泛成功，但最近的方法严重依赖于黑盒方法，如神经网络。不幸的是，这些方法阻碍了考察每个特征对于产生最终建议决策的贡献。虽然在经典算法（如最小二乘策略迭代）中可以轻松提供这样的解释，但基本的线性假设阻止了学习特征之间的高阶灵活交互作用。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，提供了一种灵活的技术来克服这些限制，并能够得到解释性强的决策建议模型。",
