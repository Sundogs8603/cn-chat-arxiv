    "translated_abstract": "逆短时傅里叶变换网络（iSTFTNet）通过使用快速、轻量级的1D CNN作为主干，并将一些神经过程替换为iSTFT，以获得快速、轻量级和高保真度的语音合成。由于1D CNN很难模拟高维谱图，频率维度通过时间上采样进行降维。然而，这种策略会损害增强速度的潜力。因此，我们提出了iSTFTNet2，它是iSTFTNet的改进版本，采用1D-2D CNN，使用1D和2D CNN分别建模时间和谱图结构。我们设计了一个2D CNN，在转换到少量频率空间后执行频率上采样。这种设计使得能够模拟高维谱图而不损害速度。结果表明，iSTFTNet2使得iSTFTNet更快、更轻量级，同时保持可比较的语音质量。",
