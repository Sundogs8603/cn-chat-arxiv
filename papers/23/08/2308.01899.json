    "translated_abstract": "预印本在学术界扮演着越来越重要的角色。研究人员在正式提交到期刊或会议之前将他们的手稿发布到预印本服务器上的原因有很多，但预印本的使用也引发了不少争议，尤其是与优先权的声明有关。本文对2008年至2017年期间提交到arXiv的计算机科学预印本进行了案例研究，以量化最终有多少预印本在同行评审的场合中被印刷。在这些已发表的手稿中，有些以不同的标题发表，且未更新arXiv上的预印本。对于这些手稿，传统的模糊匹配方法无法将预印本与最终发表版本对应起来。鉴于这个问题，我们引入了一种基于语义的映射方法，利用Transformers中的Bidirectional Encoder Representations (BERT)。利用这种新的映射方法和多种数据来源...",
