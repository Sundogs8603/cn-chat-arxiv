    "translated_abstract": "背景：冠状动脉钙化是重要的心血管不良事件（MACE）的预测因子。传统的阿加特斯顿分数仅仅是简单地对钙进行求和，虽然以非线性的方式但仍有改进空间，可以更全面地捕捉疾病的程度。目标：确定是否使用详细的钙化特征（即钙组学）通过AI方法可以改进MACE的预测。方法：我们研究了钙化的其他特征，包括质量、体积、密度、空间分布、区域等。我们使用具有弹性网正则化的Cox模型对2457例CT钙分数进行了分析，该数据是由大型免费的CLARIFY项目（ClinicalTri-als.gov标识符：NCT04075162）得到的，该项目着重于MACE事件。我们采用采样技术来增强模型的训练。我们还研究了具有选定特征的Cox模型，以确定可以解释高风险特征。结果：我们提出的钙组学模型经过修改的同步模型使得心血管风险预测得到了明显的改善。",
