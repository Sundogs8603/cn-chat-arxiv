    "translated_abstract": "数据价值评估是数据中心化机器学习研究中的关键问题，旨在量化单个数据源在训练机器学习模型中的有用性。然而，尽管其重要性，数据价值评估面临着很多重要但经常被忽视的隐私挑战。本文针对目前最实用的数据价值评估方法之一KNN-Shapley，研究了这些挑战。我们首先强调了KNN-Shapley固有的隐私风险，并展示了将KNN-Shapley改进以满足差分隐私(DP)的显著技术困难。为了克服这些挑战，我们引入了TKNN-Shapley，KNN-Shapley的一种改进变体，具有隐私友好性，可以进行简单的修正以包含DP保证（DP-TKNN-Shapley）。我们证明，DP-TKNN-Shapley在辨别数据质量方面具有一些优势，并在隐私-实用性权衡方面优于朴素化的KNN-Shapley。此外，即使是非隐私的TKNN-Shapley也能以线性时间运行。",
