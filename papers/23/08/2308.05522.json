    "translated_abstract": "反合成是将化学化合物逐步递归地分解为分子前体，直到找到一组商业上可用的分子为止，以提供合成路线。它的两个主要研究方向，即单步反合成预测和多步合成规划，它们的目标是模拟化学反应逻辑和找到正确的反应顺序，二者密切相关。然而，这种联系在当前的研究中没有得到体现。在这项工作中，我们通过将多个单步反合成模型应用于多步合成规划并使用公开和专有的反应数据进行分析，将这两个主要研究方向结合起来。我们发现单步性能较好与找到潜在的反应路径成功之间存在断裂，这表明将来必须在合成规划中评估单步模型。此外，我们还展示了常用的单步反合成模型在合成规划中的应用效果。",
