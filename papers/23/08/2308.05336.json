    "translated_abstract": "非正式语言是一种在非正式场合中经常使用的口头或书面语言风格，包括日常对话、社交媒体、博客、电子邮件和短信。在非正式写作中，语言在不同语言之间会出现一些词汇和/或句法的变化。波斯语是一种正式和非正式写作风格之间存在许多差异的语言，因此为该语言开发非正式语言处理工具显得必要。这样的转换器需要一个大规模的正式-非正式句子对齐平行语料库，可以帮助语言学家提取非正式波斯语的规范语法和正字法，就像对正式语言已经做的那样。本文介绍了我们构建了一个包含5万个句子对且以词语/短语级别对齐的平行语料库的方法。句子试图涵盖非正式波斯语和正式波斯语之间几乎所有类型的词汇和句法变化，因此采用了探索和收集两种方法。",
