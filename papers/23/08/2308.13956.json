    "abstract": "A patient firm interacts with a sequence of consumers. The firm is either an honest type who supplies high quality and never erases its action, or an opportunistic type who can choose what quality to supply and may erase its action at a low cost. We show that in every equilibrium, the firm has an incentive to build a reputation for supplying high quality until its continuation value exceeds its commitment payoff, but its ex ante payoff must be close to its minmax value when it has a sufficiently long lifespan. Therefore, even a small fraction of opportunistic types can wipe out the firm's returns from building reputations. Even if the honest type can commit to disclosure policies, the opportunistic type's payoff cannot exceed its equilibrium payoff when the firm reveals no information, regardless of the disclosure policy the honest type commits to.",

    "translated_abstract": "一个患者公司与一系列消费者进行互动。该公司可以是一个供应高质量且从不删除记录的诚实类型，也可以是一个可以选择供应何种质量并可以以低成本删除记录的机会主义类型。我们表明，在每个均衡中，公司有动机建立起供应高质量的声誉，直到其延续价值超过承诺收益为止，但在其寿命足够长的情况下，其前期收益必须接近其最小最大值。因此，即使是一小部分机会主义类型也可以消除公司建立声誉所带来的收益。即使诚实类型可以致力于公开政策，当公司不透露任何信息时，机会主义类型的收益也不能超过其均衡收益，而不管诚实类型承诺采取的公开政策是什么。",
