    "translated_abstract": "在AI安全领域，一个特别具有挑战性的问题是在高维自主系统的行为上提供保证。以可达性分析为中心的验证方法无法扩展，而纯粹的统计方法受到对采样过程的分布假设的限制。相反，我们提出了一个针对黑盒系统的分布鲁棒版本的统计验证问题，其中我们的性能保证适用于大量的分布。本文提出了一种基于主动学习、不确定性量化和神经网络验证的新方法。我们方法的一个核心部分是一种称为不精确神经网络的集成技术，它提供了不确定性以指导主动学习。主动学习使用了一种称为Sherlock的全面神经网络验证工具来收集样本。在openAI gym Mujoco环境中使用多个物理模拟器进行评估。",
