    "translated_abstract": "随着超级计算成为现实，云数据中心的计算节点能源需求将继续增长。减少能源需求的一种常见方法是在系统其他部分面临瓶颈时限制硬件组件的功耗。然而，设计一个能够实时检测并限制功耗的资源控制器是一个复杂的问题，还可能对应用程序性能产生不利影响。在本文中，我们探索了使用强化学习来设计云计算节点上的功率限制策略，通过观察当前功耗和瞬时应用程序性能（心跳）来实现。通过利用Argo Node资源管理（NRM）软件堆栈和英特尔运行平均功耗限制（RAPL）硬件控制机制，我们设计了一个代理来控制供应给处理器的最大功率，而不会影响应用程序性能。采用一种接近策略优化算法（Proximal）",
