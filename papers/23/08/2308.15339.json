    "abstract": "The accuracy of coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosis is dependent on a variety of factors, including demographic, symptom, and medical examination, ECG, and echocardiography data, among others. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) can help clinicians identify high-risk patients early in the diagnostic process, by synthesizing information from multiple factors. To this aim, Machine Learning algorithms are used to classify patients based on their CAD disease risk. In this study, we contribute to this research filed by developing a methodology for balancing and augmenting data for more accurate prediction when the data is imbalanced and the sample size is small. The methodology can be used in a variety of other situations, particularly when data collection is expensive and the sample size is small. The experimental results revealed that the average accuracy of our proposed method for CAD prediction was 95.36, and was higher than random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), support ",

    "translated_abstract": "冠状动脉疾病（CAD）的诊断准确性取决于多种因素，包括人口统计学、症状、医学检查、心电图和超声心动图等数据。在这种情况下，人工智能（AI）可以帮助临床医生在诊断过程的早期阶段识别高风险患者，通过综合多个因素的信息。为了实现这一目标，使用机器学习算法根据CAD疾病风险对患者进行分类。在本研究中，我们通过开发一种用于平衡和增强数据以提高预测准确性的方法，在病例数据不平衡且样本量较小的情况下为这一研究领域作出了贡献。该方法可以在各种情况下使用，特别是在数据收集成本高且样本量较小的情况下。实验结果表明，我们提出的CAD预测方法的平均准确率为95.36，高于随机森林（RF）、决策树（DT）、支持向量机（SVM）等方法。",
