    "translated_abstract": "无监督表示学习方法旨在从无标签数据中学习有区分性的特征表示，而无需对每个样本进行注释。对于时间序列数据来说，实现无监督表示学习非常关键，因为其复杂特性和缺乏与其他数据形态相比的视觉提示导致了标注困境。近年来，无监督表示学习技术在各个领域取得了快速发展。然而，对于时间序列的无监督表示学习方法缺乏系统性的分析。为了填补这个空白，我们进行了对时间序列领域中现有快速发展的无监督表示学习方法的全面文献综述。此外，我们还开发了一个统一和标准化的库，名为ULTS（即无监督时间序列学习），以便对各种模型进行快速实现和统一评估。通过ULTS，我们经验性地评估了无监督表示学习方法在不同任务上的性能，并为未来的研究提供了参考。",
