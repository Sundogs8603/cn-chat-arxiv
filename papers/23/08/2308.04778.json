    "translated_abstract": "通过将相关对象组合起来，无监督的机器学习技术旨在揭示数据集中的潜在模式。非负矩阵分解（NMF）是一种数据挖掘技术，通过对元素非负性施加限制，将数据矩阵分解为两个矩阵：一个表示数据分区，另一个表示数据集的聚类原型。该方法受到了广泛关注，并在文本挖掘、聚类、语言建模、音乐转录和神经科学（基因分离）等多个应用领域中得到了应用。生成矩阵的解释由于不存在负值而变得更简单。在本文中，我们提出了一项关于多模态聚类算法的研究，并提出了一种新颖的方法，称为多模态多视图非负矩阵分解，其中我们分析了多个本地NMF模型的协作。实验结果显示了所提方法的价值。",
