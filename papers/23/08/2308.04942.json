    "translated_abstract": "人工智能生成内容（AIGC）服务在数字内容创造领域有着巨大的潜力。AIGC的独特能力，如基于最小输入的内容生成，特别是在与语义沟通（SemCom）相结合时，具有巨大的潜力。本文提出了一个新的综合概念模型，用于AIGC和SemCom的集成。特别地，在语义层之上引入了一个内容生成层，清晰地概述了AIGC和SemCom如何相互作用以产生有意义和有效的内容。此外，提出了一个采用AIGC技术作为语义信息编码器和解码器的新框架，考虑到针对AIGC服务定制的语义提取和评估指标的联合优化。该框架可以适应不同类型的生成内容、所需的质量和所利用的语义信息。通过采用深度Q网络（DQN），对具体案例进行了实验验证。",
