    "translated_abstract": "在过去几年中，生成逼真面孔的进展非常大。尽管有这些进展，一个关键的问题仍然没有答案：“给定一个生成的人脸模型，它能够生成多少个独特的身份？”换句话说，生成人脸模型的生物特征容量是多少？回答这个问题的科学依据将有助于评估和比较不同的生成人脸模型，并确定它们的可扩展性的上限。本文提出了一种统计方法来估计在一个超球特征空间中生成的人脸图像的生物特征容量。我们在多个生成模型上应用了我们的方法，包括无条件生成器如StyleGAN、潜在扩散模型和“生成的照片”，以及DCF面，一个类条件生成器。我们还估计了与性别和年龄等人口属性相关的容量。我们的容量估计表明，在虚假接受条件下，使用ArcFace表示：",
