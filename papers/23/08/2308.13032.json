    "abstract": "The paper considers the possibility to fine-tune Llama 2 Large Language Model (LLM) for the multitask analysis of financial news. For fine-tuning, the PEFT/LoRA based approach was used. In the study, the model was fine-tuned for the following tasks: analysing a text from financial market perspectives, highlighting main points of a text, summarizing a text and extracting named entities with appropriate sentiments. The obtained results show that the fine-tuned Llama 2 model can perform a multitask financial news analysis with a specified structure of response, part of response can be a structured text and another part of data can have JSON format for further processing. Extracted sentiments for named entities can be considered as predictive features in supervised machine learning models with quantitative target variables.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了使用精细调整的Llama 2 Large Language Model (LLM) 对金融新闻进行多任务分析的可能性。通过PEFT/LoRA方法对模型进行精细调整，主要包括从金融市场角度分析文本、突出文本的主要观点、对文本进行摘要和提取具有适当情感的命名实体等任务。实验结果表明，经过精细调整的Llama 2模型能够进行多任务的金融新闻分析，其响应的结构可以部分为结构化文本，另一部分数据可以采用JSON格式进一步处理。提取的命名实体情感可以被视为具有定量目标变量的监督机器学习模型的预测特征。",
