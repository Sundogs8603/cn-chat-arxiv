    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种双语解决方案，以支持在混合自动语音识别（ASR）环境中，英语作为大多数主要语言环境的第二语言。我们的关键开发包括：（a）使用字素单位而不是音素单位的发音词典，（b）完全双语对齐模型，随后是双语流式转换器模型，（c）带有语言识别（LID）损失的平行编码器结构，（d）带有辅助损失的平行编码器，用于单语投影。我们得出结论，与LID损失相比，我们提出的辅助损失在将平行编码器专门用于各自的单语环境方面更优秀，这有助于更强大的双语学习。我们在双语西班牙语（ES）和双语意大利语（IT）应用的大规模训练和测试任务上评估了我们的工作。我们的双语模型展示了较强的英语混合能力。特别是，双语IT模型改善了英语混合IT ta的错误率（WER）。",
