    "abstract": "Autonomous driving systems are always built on motion-related modules such as the planner and the controller. An accurate and robust trajectory tracking method is indispensable for these motion-related modules as a primitive routine. Current methods often make strong assumptions about the model such as the context and the dynamics, which are not robust enough to deal with the changing scenarios in a real-world system. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based trajectory tracking method for the motion-related modules in autonomous driving systems. The representation learning ability of DL and the exploration nature of RL bring strong robustness and improve accuracy.

    "translated_abstract": "自主驾驶系统总是建立在运动相关模块（如规划器和控制器）之上。准确而稳健的轨迹跟踪方法对于这些运动相关模块来说是不可或缺的原始例程。当前的方法往往对模型（如上下文和动力学）做出了强烈的假设，这些假设不足以应对真实系统中的场景变化。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的自主驾驶系统中运动相关模块的轨迹跟踪方法。DL的表示学习能力和RL的探索性质既带来了强健性又提高了准确性。与此同时，它通过以无模型和数据驱动的方式运行轨迹跟踪来增强了通用性。通过大量实验，我们证明了我们的方法相比当前方法在效率和效果上的优势。",
