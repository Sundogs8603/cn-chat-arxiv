    "translated_abstract": "电信网络的复杂性和规模的增加导致了对自动异常检测系统的日益关注。然而，对于在网络关键性能指标（KPI）上检测到的异常的分类却受到较少关注，导致缺乏关于异常特征和分类过程的信息。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一个模块化的异常分类框架。该框架假设异常分类器和检测器作为独立的实体，允许对时间序列上的异常检测和分类任务进行独立处理。本研究的目标是：（1）开发一个生成类似于实际网络KPI行为的合成时间序列的时间序列模拟器；（2）构建一个检测模型，识别时间序列中的异常；（3）构建准确将检测到的异常分类到预定义类别的分类模型；（4）评估分类框架的性能。",
