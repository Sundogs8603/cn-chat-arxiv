    "abstract": "This paper presents a new database consisting of concurrent articulatory and acoustic speech data. The articulatory data correspond to ultrasound videos of the vocal tract dynamics, which allow the visualization of the tongue upper contour during the speech production process. Acoustic data is composed of 30 short sentences that were acquired by a directional cardioid microphone. This database includes data from 17 young subjects (8 male and 9 female) from the Santander region in Colombia, who reported not having any speech pathology.",
