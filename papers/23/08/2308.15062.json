    "abstract": "Systematically biased forecasts are typically interpreted as evidence of forecasters' irrationality and/or asymmetric loss. In this paper we propose an alternative explanation: when forecasts inform economic policy decisions, and the resulting actions affect the realization of the forecast target itself, forecasts may be optimally biased even under quadratic loss. The result arises in environments in which the forecaster is uncertain about the decision maker's reaction to the forecast, which is presumably the case in most applications. We illustrate the empirical relevance of our theory by reviewing some stylized properties of Green Book inflation forecasts and relating them to the predictions from our model. Our results point out that the presence of policy feedback poses a challenge to traditional tests of forecast rationality.",

    "translated_abstract": "通常将系统性有偏差的预测解释为预测者的非理性和/或非对称损失的证据。在本文中，我们提出了一种替代解释：当预测影响经济政策决策，并且由此产生的行动影响预测目标本身的实现时，即使在二次损失下，预测可能也是最优有偏差的。该结果出现在预测者对决策者对预测的反应存在不确定性的环境中，这在大多数应用中可能是存在的。我们通过回顾一些Green Book通胀预测的特征，并将其与我们模型的预测进行关联，说明了我们理论的实证相关性。我们的结果指出，政策反馈的存在对传统的预测理性测试构成了挑战。",
