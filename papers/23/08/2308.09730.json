    "abstract": "Many studies have investigated deep-learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical imaging diagnosis of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), with many reports of near-perfect performance. However, variability in performance and underlying data biases raise concerns about clinical generalizability. This retrospective study involved the development and evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) models for COVID-19 diagnosis using both diverse clinical and virtually generated medical images. In addition, we conducted a virtual imaging trial to assess how AI performance is affected by several patient- and physics-based factors, including the extent of disease, radiation dose, and imaging modality of computed tomography (CT) and chest radiography (CXR). AI performance was strongly influenced by dataset characteristics including quantity, diversity, and prevalence, leading to poor generalization with up to 20% drop in receiver operating characteristic area under the curve.

    "translated_abstract": "许多研究已经调查了基于深度学习的人工智能（AI）模型在新型冠状病毒（COVID-19）的医学影像诊断中的应用，许多报道称其性能几乎完美。然而，性能的变异性和潜在的数据偏差引发了对临床适用性的担忧。本回顾性研究涉及使用临床多样性和虚拟生成的医学图像开发和评估COVID-19诊断的人工智能（AI）模型。此外，我们进行了一次虚拟成像试验，以评估AI性能受疾病范围、辐射剂量和计算机断层扫描（CT）和胸部放射摄影（CXR）成像模态等几个患者和物理性因素的影响。数据集特征（包括数量、多样性和患病率）强烈影响了AI的性能，导致接收者操作特征曲线下面积下降了高达20％，且泛化能力差。",
