    "abstract": "Nowadays, modern recommender systems usually leverage textual and visual contents as auxiliary information to predict user preference. For textual information, review texts are one of the most popular contents to model user behaviors. Nevertheless, reviews usually lose their shine when it comes to top-N recommender systems because those that solely utilize textual reviews as features struggle to adequately capture the interaction relationships between users and items. For visual one, it is usually modeled with naive convolutional networks and also hard to capture high-order relationships between users and items. Moreover, previous works did not collaboratively use both texts and images in a proper way. In this paper, we propose printf, preference modeling based on user reviews with item images and textual information via graph learning, to address the above challenges. Specifically, the dimension-based attention mechanism directs relations between user reviews and interacted items, all",

    "translated_abstract": "现代推荐系统通常利用文本和视觉内容作为辅助信息来预测用户偏好。对于文本信息来说，评论文本是建模用户行为的最受欢迎内容之一。然而，在仅使用文本评论作为特征的前N个推荐系统中，评论通常失去了它们的亮点，因为它们很难充分捕捉用户和物品之间的交互关系。对于视觉信息，通常会使用简单的卷积网络来建模，但很难捕捉用户和物品之间的高阶关系。此外，以前的工作没有合理地共同使用文本和图像。本文提出了基于图学习的printf，即基于用户评论与物品图像和文本信息的偏好建模，以解决上述挑战。具体而言，基于维度的注意力机制指导用户评论和交互项之间的关系，所有部分共同学习以更好地建模用户偏好。",
