    "translated_abstract": "我们提出将正则表达式推理（REI）作为代码/语言建模以及更广泛的机器学习社区的挑战。REI是一个有监督的机器学习和程序合成任务，它提出了从示例中找到最小正则表达式的问题：给定两个有限字符串集合P和N以及一个成本函数cost(·)，任务是生成一个接受P中所有字符串并拒绝N中所有字符串的表达式r，而不存在其他表达式r'，使得cost(r')<cost(r)。REI作为一个挑战问题具有以下优势：（i）正则表达式是众所周知、广泛使用的，是代码的自然理想化；（ii）REI的渐近最坏情况复杂性已被充分理解；（iii）REI具有一小部分易于理解的参数（例如P或N的基数、示例的字符串长度或成本函数），这使得我们可以轻松调整REI的难度；（iv）对于基于深度学习的M模型而言，REI是一个未解决的问题。",
