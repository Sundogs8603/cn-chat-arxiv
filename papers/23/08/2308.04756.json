    "translated_abstract": "信息检索（IR）或知识检索是许多下游任务（如开放领域问答）的关键组成部分。然而，它面临许多挑战，因为它需要简洁性、完整性和正确性。最近的研究中，通过使用稠密向量表示查询和知识段落，并学习词汇和语义相似性，稠密检索模型在领域内IR和QA基准上取得了最先进的性能。然而，使用单一的稠密向量和端到端监督并不总是最优的，因为查询可能需要注意多个方面和隐含的知识。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种信息检索流程，利用实体/事件链接模型和查询分解模型，更准确地聚焦于查询的不同信息单元。我们证明，尽管更具解释性和可靠性，我们提出的流程在段落覆盖和命名准确性方面都有显著改进。",
