    "translated_abstract": "变压器架构和自注意机制的引入导致了在特定下游任务和数据领域训练的语言模型的爆炸性增长。在Hugging Face生态系统中有超过200,000个模型，用户在选择和优化模型以适应多方面的工作流程和数据领域的同时，还要解决计算、安全和时效性等问题。迫切需要机器学习框架来消除模型选择和定制化的负担，并释放庞大的新兴模型库的巨大威力给最终用户。在这里，我们提出了一个上下文感知的路由系统Tryage，它利用语言模型路由器根据对个体输入提示的分析，从模型库中选择最佳的专家模型。受大脑中的丘脑路由器启发，Tryage采用感知路由器来预测下游模型在提示上的性能，并根据目标做出路由决策。",
