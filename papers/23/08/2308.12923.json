    "translated_abstract": "决策问题可以被表示为数学优化模型，在经济学、工程学与制造业、交通运输和医疗保健等领域有广泛应用。优化模型是在满足一组要求或约束条件的情况下做出最佳决策的数学抽象。部署这些模型的主要障碍之一是帮助从业人员理解和解释这些模型，特别是当它们是不可行的，也就是说没有决策满足所有的约束条件。现有的诊断不可行优化模型的方法往往依赖于专家系统，需要在优化方面具有重要的背景知识。在本文中，我们介绍了OptiChat，这是一种首创的基于自然语言的系统，配备了一个与聊天机器人进行交互式对话的GUI，用于讨论不可行的优化模型。OptiChat可以提供对优化模型的自然语言描述。",
