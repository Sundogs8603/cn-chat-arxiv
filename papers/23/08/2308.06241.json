    "abstract": "When any extraordinary event takes place in the world wide area, it is the social media that acts as the fastest carrier of the news along with the consequences dealt with that event. One can gather much information through social networks regarding the sentiments, behavior, and opinions of the people. In this paper, we focus mainly on sentiment analysis of twitter data of India which comprises of COVID-19 tweets. We show how Twitter data has been extracted and then run sentimental analysis queries on it. This is helpful to analyze the information in the tweets where opinions are highly unstructured, heterogeneous, and are either positive or negative or neutral in some cases.",
