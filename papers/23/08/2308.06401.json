    "translated_abstract": "脑机接口（BCI）最初引起关注是为了开发帮助被身体残障人士的应用。最近，将BCI与增强现实（AR）结合的想法出现了，这不仅可以增强残障人士的生活质量，还可以为健康用户开发主流应用。其中一种常用的BCI信号模式是稳态视觉诱发电位（SSVEP），它捕捉了大脑对闪烁视觉刺激的响应。基于SSVEP的BCI-AR应用使用户可以通过简单地看着相应的命令选项来表达他们的需求/愿望。然而，不同个体的脑信号是不同的，因此需要针对每个个体进行SSVEP识别。此外，肌肉运动和眼睑闪烁会干扰脑信号，因此受试者需要在BCI实验期间保持静止，这限制了增强现实的参与。本文提出了一个简单的自适应集成分类系统来处理这些问题。",
