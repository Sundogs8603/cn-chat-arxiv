    "translated_abstract": "高精度（HD）地图对自动驾驶系统至关重要。最近的方法尝试基于车载传感器获取的信息实时构建HD地图。然而，这些方法的性能受到车辆周围环境的显著影响，这是由于车载传感器的固有限制，如对远程探测的能力不足。在本研究中，我们证明了通过补充卫星地图可以增强HD地图构建方法的性能，利用卫星地图的广泛覆盖能力。为了进一步的研究，我们发布了卫星地图瓦片作为nuScenes数据集的补充数据集。与此同时，我们提出了一个分层融合模块，使卫星地图信息与现有方法更好地融合。具体来说，我们设计了基于分割和距离的注意力掩码，应用交叉注意力机制来融合车载传感器与卫星地图的信息。",
