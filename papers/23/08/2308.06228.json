    "translated_abstract": "及时、准确和可靠的信息对于决策者、应急管理人员和基础设施运营商在洪灾事件中至关重要。本研究演示了一种名为MaxFloodCast的机器学习模型，该模型在哈里斯县的基于物理的水动力模拟中进行训练，能够高效和可解释地预测洪水淹没深度。在未见数据上达到0.949的平均R-squared和0.61英尺的均方根误差，证明其在预测洪水峰值淹没深度方面的可靠性。通过与飓风哈维和伊梅尔达风暴进行验证，MaxFloodCast显示了在支持近时洪水平原管理和紧急行动方面的潜力。模型的可解释性有助于决策者提供关键信息，以制定洪水防治策略，优先考虑临界设施区域，并研究其他流域降雨如何影响某一区域的洪水暴露。MaxFloodCast模型使淹没深度的预测准确且可解释。",
