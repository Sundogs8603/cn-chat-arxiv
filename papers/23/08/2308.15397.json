    "translated_abstract": "色彩是对产品销售产生强大影响的最重要的内在感觉特征。色彩甚至对我们大脑中的审美感知起到提高的作用。考虑到个体差异在色彩美学中至关重要。对于各种电子商务应用，需要用户驱动的机制。我们提出了一种用于定量评估对颜色的所有类型的知觉反应的方法：明确的颜色偏好、色彩协调和色彩组合偏好。通过结合基本颜色的偏好和色彩协调的评分，可以预测对色彩方案的偏好。使用基于模糊相似性和分组的比较算法从大数据集中提取协调调色板。所提出的模型能够对多色图像的协调和偏好进行有用的预测。例如，在服装协调的背景下，它允许根据服装颜色预测外观的偏好。我们的方法与标准的审美模型有所不同。",
