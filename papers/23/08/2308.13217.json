    "translated_abstract": "超声心动图（echo）是一种广泛用于各种心血管诊断任务的超声成像技术。由于基于echo的诊断存在观察者间变异性，这是由于echo图像采集的变异性和基于临床经验对echo图像的解释导致的，基于视觉的机器学习（ML）方法越来越受欢迎作为二次验证层。对于这种安全关键应用，任何提出的ML方法都必须具备一定的可解释性和良好的准确性。此外，这种方法必须能够处理来自各种心脏视图的多个echo视频以及它们之间的交互，以适当地对多种心血管测量或解释任务进行预测。现有工作缺乏可解释性，或者在范围上受限于专注于单一心血管任务。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种通用的基于超声心动图的多级Transformer（GEMTrans）框架。",
