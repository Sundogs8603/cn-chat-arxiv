    "translated_abstract": "逼真的虚拟人在许多行业中起着关键作用，例如元宇宙、智能医疗和自动驾驶模拟。但是大规模创造具有高度逼真度的虚拟人仍然是一个挑战。深度隐式函数的应用开启了基于图像的三维穿着人体重建的新时代，实现了具有细节的像素对齐形状恢复。随后，绝大部分工作通过回归每个点的确定性隐式值来定位表面。然而，是否应该不考虑与表面的距离而将所有点都一视同仁呢？在本文中，我们提出用自适应不确定性分布替换隐式值，根据点与表面的距离对它们进行区分。这种简单的“值到分布”的转变显著改进了几乎所有的基准方法。此外，定性结果表明，使用我们的不确定性分布损失训练的模型可以产生令人满意的效果。",
