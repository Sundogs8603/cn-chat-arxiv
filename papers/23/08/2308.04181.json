The Approximate Entropy and Sample Entropy statistics which measure the level of repeatability in the data are used to quantify the randomness in the forex returns from the time period 2006 to 2021. The main objective of the research is to see how the randomness of the foreign exchange returns evolve over the given time period particularly during periods of high financial instability or turbulence in the global financial market. With this objective we look at 2 major financial upheavals, the subprime crisis also known as the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) during 2006-2007 and the recent Covid-19 pandemic during 2020-2021. Our empirical results overwhelmingly confirm our working hypothesis that regularity in the returns of the major Indian foreign exchange rates increases during times of financial crisis. This is evidenced by a decrease in the valu",

    "translated_abstract": "本文使用熵的概念研究印度外汇市场回报的规律性/非规律性。使用近似熵和样本熵统计量来衡量数据中的可重复性程度，并量化时间段为2006年至2021年的外汇回报的随机性。研究的主要目标是观察外汇回报的随机性在给定的时间段内，特别是在全球金融市场出现高度不稳定或动荡的时期，是如何演变的。为了实现这一目标，我们研究了两个重大的金融动荡事件，即2006年至2007年的次贷危机，也被称为全球金融危机（GFC），以及2020年至2021年的新冠疫情。我们的实证结果极大地证实了我们的工作假设，即印度主要外汇汇率的回报规律性在金融危机时期增加。这一点通过回报的波动率的减少来证明。",
