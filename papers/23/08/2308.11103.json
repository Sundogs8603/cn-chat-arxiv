    "translated_abstract": "在欧盟和瑞士，法院裁决中自然人和法人的匿名性是隐私保护的关键方面。随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现，对于匿名人员的大规模再识别的担忧日益增长。根据瑞士联邦最高法院的要求，我们通过使用来自瑞士联邦最高法院的实际法律数据构建了一个概念验证，来探讨LLMs重新识别法院裁决中个人的潜力。在最初的实验之后，我们构建了一个经过匿名化处理的维基百科数据集，作为一个更严格的测试场地来进一步研究研究结果。通过引入并应用文本中再识别人员的新任务，我们还引入了新的性能衡量指标。我们系统地分析了影响成功再识别的因素，确定模型大小、输入长度和指令调整是最重要的决定因素之一。尽管在匿名化处理后，LLMs在重新识别上的成功率很高，但在某些情况下仍然存在风险。",
