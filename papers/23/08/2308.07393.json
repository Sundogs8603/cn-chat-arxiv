    "abstract": "Accurate recognition of specific categories, such as persons' names, dates or other identifiers is critical in many Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) applications. As these categories represent personal information, ethical use of this data including collection, transcription, training and evaluation demands special care. One way of ensuring the security and privacy of individuals is to redact or eliminate Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from collection altogether. However, this results in ASR models that tend to have lower recognition accuracy of these categories. We use text-injection to improve the recognition of PII categories by including fake textual substitutes of PII categories in the training data using a text injection method. We demonstrate substantial improvement to Recall of Names and Dates in medical notes while improving overall WER. For alphanumeric digit sequences we show improvements to Character Error Rate and Sentence Accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "在许多自动语音识别（ASR）应用中，准确识别特定类别（例如人名、日期或其他标识符）至关重要。由于这些类别代表个人信息，对于包括收集、转录、训练和评估在内的数据的合规使用需要特别注意。确保个人安全和隐私的一种方法是完全删除或修饰收集到的可识别个人信息（PII）。然而，这样做会导致ASR模型在这些类别上的识别准确性较低。我们使用文本注入方法在训练数据中包含PII类别的虚假文本替代物，以提高PII类别的识别。我们展示了在医疗记录中人名和日期的召回率显著提高，同时改善了整体的识别错误率。对于字母数字序列，我们还改善了字符错误率和句子准确性。",
