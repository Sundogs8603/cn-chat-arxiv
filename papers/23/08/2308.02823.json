    "translated_abstract": "AI在解决数学问题方面取得了重大进展，但由于几何问题依赖于文本和图表，因此仍然具有挑战性。在文本描述中，符号字符（如“$\\triangle$ABC”）通常作为连接相应图表的桥梁。然而，通过将符号字符仅仅分解为单个字母（如'A'、'B'和'C'），现有的方法未能明确研究它们，从而失去了与图表的语义关系。在本文中，我们开发了一个符号感知模型，以完全探索这些字符在文本和图表理解中的作用，并在多模态推理框架下对模型进行优化。在文本编码器方面，我们提出将个别符号字符与相应图表的几何信息合并形成一个语义单元。对于图表编码器，我们使用符号字符作为标签，在多标签分类框架下对其进行预训练。此外，我们增强了模型的目标函数，使其在文本和图表之间进行几何一致性约束的训练。",
