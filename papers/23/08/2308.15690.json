    "abstract": "We present 'CongNaMul', a comprehensive dataset designed for various tasks in soybean sprouts image analysis. The CongNaMul dataset is curated to facilitate tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation, decomposition, and measurement of length and weight. The classification task provides four classes to determine the quality of soybean sprouts: normal, broken, spotted, and broken and spotted, for the development of AI-aided automatic quality inspection technology. For semantic segmentation, images with varying complexity, from single sprout images to images with multiple sprouts, along with human-labelled mask images, are included. The label has 4 different classes: background, head, body, tail. The dataset also provides images and masks for the image decomposition task, including two separate sprout images and their combined form. Lastly, 5 physical features of sprouts (head length, body length, body thickness, tail length, weight) are provided for image-based measurement",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了“CongNaMul”，这是一个为大豆芽图像分析的各种任务而设计的综合数据集。CongNaMul数据集旨在促进图像分类、语义分割、分解以及长度和重量的测量等任务。分类任务提供了四个类别来确定大豆芽的质量：正常、断裂、斑点和断裂和斑点，以开发基于人工智能辅助的自动质量检测技术。对于语义分割，数据集包括了具有不同复杂度的图像，从单个芽图像到具有多个芽的图像，以及人工标记的掩膜图像。标签包括4个不同的类别：背景、头部、身体和尾部。数据集还为图像分解任务提供了图像和掩膜，包括两个分离的芽图像和它们的组合形式。最后，还提供了芽的5个物理特征（头部长度、身体长度、身体厚度、尾部长度、重量）供基于图像的测量使用。",
