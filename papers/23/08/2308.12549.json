    "translated_abstract": "与3D LiDAR物体跟踪中共享参数的编码器从模板和搜索区域分别提取特征的Siamese网络已成为事实上的基准框架。这个范式严重依赖于额外的匹配网络来建模模板和搜索区域的交叉相关性/相似性。本文不再使用传统的Siamese范式，提出了一种新颖的单支架构SyncTrack，通过同步特征提取和匹配，避免了为模板和搜索区域分别转发编码器两次，也避免了引入额外的匹配网络参数。同步机制基于Transformer的动态亲和力，并提供了理论上的相关性深入分析。此外，基于同步，我们引入了一种新颖的Transformer层中的Attention Points-Sampling策略（APST），用采样代替了随机/最远点采样（FPS）方法，并在采样过程中有监督地进行。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes SyncTrack, a novel single-branch framework, which synchronizes feature extracting and matching for 3D object tracking. It simplifies the Siamese network used in the traditional paradigm, eliminates multiple forwarding of the encoder, and avoids introducing extra parameters. The introduction of a new Attentive Points-Sampling strategy in the Transformer layers shows promising results in feature sampling."
