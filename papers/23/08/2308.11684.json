    "abstract": "Social media users often hold several accounts in their effort to multiply the spread of their thoughts, ideas, and viewpoints. In the particular case of objectionable content, users tend to create multiple accounts to bypass the combating measures enforced by social media platforms and thus retain their online identity even if some of their accounts are suspended. User identity linkage aims to reveal social media accounts likely to belong to the same natural person so as to prevent the spread of abusive/illegal activities. To this end, this work proposes a machine learning-based detection model, which uses multiple attributes of users' online activity in order to identify whether two or more virtual identities belong to the same real natural person. The models efficacy is demonstrated on two cases on abusive and terrorism-related Twitter content.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体用户通常会在其努力扩大他们的思想、观点和观点传播范围时拥有多个账户。在令人反感的内容的特殊情况下，用户倾向于创建多个账户，以绕过社交媒体平台实施的打击措施，即使其中一些账户被暂停，也可以保留他们的在线身份。用户身份关联旨在揭示社交媒体账户可能属于同一个自然人，以防止滥用/非法活动的传播。为此，本研究提出了一种基于机器学习的检测模型，该模型使用用户在线活动的多个属性，以确定两个或多个虚拟身份是否属于同一个真实自然人。该模型在两个滥用和与恐怖主义有关的Twitter内容案例中的有效性得到了证明。",
