    "translated_abstract": "有效的灾害响应对受影响的社区至关重要。应急人员和决策者在灾害期间在了解社区所面临问题的可靠和及时的指标上将受益于社交媒体提供的丰富数据来源。社交媒体可以反映公众关注和需求，为决策者提供有价值的洞见，以了解不断演变的情况并优化资源配置。我们使用双向编码器表示转换（BERT）主题建模对Twitter数据进行主题聚类。然后，我们进行了时间-空间分析，研究了这些主题在2020年美国西部火灾季期间在不同地区的分布情况。我们的结果显示，Twitter用户主要关注三个主题：“健康影响”，“损失”，“撤离”。我们使用易感-感染-康复（SIR）理论来探索主题在Twitter上的传播规模和速度。结果清晰地显示了主题传播的情况。",
