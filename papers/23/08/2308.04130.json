    "abstract": "We observe that a European Call option with strike $L > K$ can be seen as a Call option with strike $L-K$ on a Call option with strike $K$. Under no arbitrage assumptions, this yields immediately that the prices of the two contracts are the same, in full generality. We study in detail the relative pricing function which gives the price of the Call on Call option as a function of its underlying Call option, and provide quasi-closed formula for those new pricing functions in the Carr-Pelts-Tehranchi family [Carr and Pelts, Duality, Deltas, and Derivatives Pricing, 2015] and [Tehranchi, A Black-Scholes inequality: applications and generalisations, Finance Stoch, 2020] that includes the Black-Scholes model as a particular case. We also study the properties of the function that maps the price normalized by the underlier, viewed as a function of the moneyness, to the normalized relative price, which allows us to produce several new closed formulas.

    "translated_abstract": "我们观察到，具有行权价$L > K$的欧式看涨期权可以视为具有行权价$L-K$的期权对看涨期权。在无套利假设下，这立即得出两个合约的价格是一样的，完全一般化。我们详细研究了相对定价函数，它给出了看涨期权对看涨期权的价格作为其基础看涨期权的函数，并为Carr-Pelts-Tehranchi家族中的这些新定价函数提供准闭合的公式，其中包括Black-Scholes模型作为特殊情况。我们还研究了将价格以标准化方式除以标的资产，作为点价相对价格的函数的性质，这使我们能够得出几个新的闭合公式。",
