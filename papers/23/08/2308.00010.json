    "translated_abstract": "多人聚会问题是一个难以分离或区分来自几个说话者的混合语音中的个别说话者的场景。在这个领域已经进行了几项研究，但模型的大小和复杂性正在与语音分离的准确性和鲁棒性进行权衡。\"单声道多人演讲分离\"提出了一种基于Transformer架构及其高效形式的演讲分离模型。该模型使用包含多样化说话者话语的LibriMix数据集进行训练。该模型可以从混合音频输入中分离出2个不同的说话者源。该模型的开发目标是减少语音分离模型的计算复杂性，并在与现有语音分离模型性能最小化权衡的同时，实现显著的改进。该项目预计将为语音分离领域的持续研究做出贡献，同时降低计算成本。",
