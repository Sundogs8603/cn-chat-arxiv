    "translated_abstract": "结构工程中的动态响应评估是确定结构在地震、风或冲击等动态荷载作用下的响应，如构件力、节点位移等的过程。这是结构分析的重要方面，它使工程师能够评估在极端荷载条件下的结构性能，并对结构的设计和安全做出明智的决策。传统的动态响应评估方法涉及使用有限元分析（FEA）进行数值模拟，其中结构使用有限元进行建模，并通过数值求解运动方程。尽管这种方法有效，但计算开销大，并且可能不适用于实时应用。为了解决这些限制，最近在机器学习领域中，特别是人工神经网络中，已经将其应用于结构工程中的动态响应评估。这些技术利用网络的学习能力和模式识别能力来模拟结构响应，并能够在实时性能要求的应用中实现快速而准确的评估。",
