    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive learning based deep learning framework for patient similarity search using physiological signals. We use a contrastive learning based approach to learn similar embeddings of patients with similar physiological signal data. We also introduce a number of neighbor selection algorithms to determine the patients with the highest similarity on the generated embeddings. To validate the effectiveness of our framework for measuring patient similarity, we select the detection of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) through photoplethysmography (PPG) signals obtained from smartwatch devices as our case study. We present extensive experimentation of our framework on a dataset of over 170 individuals and compare the performance of our framework with other baseline methods on this dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于对比学习的深度学习框架，用于使用生理信号进行患者相似性搜索。我们使用对比学习的方法来学习具有相似生理信号数据的患者的相似嵌入。我们还引入了一些邻居选择算法，以确定生成的嵌入中具有最高相似性的患者。为了验证我们的框架用于测量患者相似性的有效性，我们选择使用从智能手表设备获取的光电容抗图信号进行心房颤动(AF)的检测作为我们的案例研究。我们对超过170名个体的数据集上的我们的框架进行了广泛的实验，并将其与该数据集上的其他基线方法的性能进行了比较。",
