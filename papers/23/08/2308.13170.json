    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究显示高性能神经翻译分类器中存在“聪明的汉斯”行为，即基于BERT的分类器利用数据与目标分类标签之间的虚假相关性，特别是主题信息，而不是真实的翻译信号。翻译信号微妙（尤其是对于专业翻译），并且与数据中的许多其他信号竞争，如流派、风格、作者和尤其是主题。这引发了一个总体问题，分类器的性能到底有多少是由于数据中的虚假相关性，而不是分类器实际针对的信号，尤其是对于微妙的目标信号和具有挑战性的（低资源）数据环境。我们重点研究基于主题的虚假相关性，并从两个方向探讨这个问题：（i）在没有关于虚假主题信息及其在数据中分布的知识的情况下，（ii）在有关虚假主题信息及其在数据中分布的一些指示的情况下。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study reveals the presence of \"Clever Hans\" behavior in high-performance neural translationese classifiers, where spurious correlations are utilized instead of genuine translation signals to improve classification performance. The study focuses on topic-based spurious correlation and examines the impact on classifier performance when there is no knowledge about spurious topic information and when some indications about it exist."
