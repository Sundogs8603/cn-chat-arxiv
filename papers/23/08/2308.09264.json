    "translated_abstract": "均值方差分析被广泛应用于投资组合管理，以在预期收益和波动性之间实现最优的权衡。然而，该方法存在一些限制，尤其是对估计误差的脆弱性和对历史数据的依赖性。虽然缩小估计器和因子模型已被引入以通过偏差-方差权衡来提高估计准确性，而Black-Litterman模型已被开发用于整合投资者观点，但缺乏一个将三种方法结合起来的统一框架。我们的研究首次提出了一个贝叶斯蓝图，将缩小估计与观点纳入融合，将两者都概念化为贝叶斯更新。然后，我们将该模型应用于Fama-French因子模型的上下文中，从而整合了每种方法的优势。最后，通过在跨越十年的美国股票市场进行全面的实证研究，我们证明该模型优于简单的$1/N$投资组合。",
