    "abstract": "We propose a new method, called PiZero, that gives an agent the ability to plan in an abstract search space of its own creation that is completely decoupled from the real environment. Unlike prior approaches, this enables the agent to perform high-level planning at arbitrary timescales and reason in terms of compound or temporally-extended actions, which can be useful in environments where large numbers of base-level micro-actions are needed to perform relevant macro-actions. In addition, our method is more general than comparable prior methods because it handles settings with continuous action spaces and partial observability. We evaluate our method on multiple domains, including navigation tasks and Sokoban. Experimentally, it outperforms comparable prior methods without assuming access to an environment simulator.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的方法，称为PiZero，它使代理能够在自己创建的抽象搜索空间中进行计划，该搜索空间与真实环境完全解耦。与先前的方法不同，这使得代理能够以任意时间尺度进行高级规划，并以复合或时间扩展动作的形式进行推理，这在需要执行大量基本微操作以执行相关宏操作的环境中非常有用。此外，我们的方法比可比的先前方法更通用，因为它处理具有连续动作空间和部分可观察性的设置。我们在多个领域进行了评估，包括导航任务和Sokoban。实验证明，它在没有假设访问环境模拟器的情况下胜过可比的先前方法。",
