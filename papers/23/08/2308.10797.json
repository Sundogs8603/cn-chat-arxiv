    "translated_abstract": "训练具备普遍能力的智能体面临的主要挑战是设计训练任务，以促进广泛泛化和对环境变化的鲁棒性。这个挑战驱动了无监督环境设计（UED）的问题设置，其中学生智能体在由教师智能体提出的自适应任务分布上进行训练。UED的先驱方法是PAIRED，它使用强化学习（RL）训练教师策略从头开始设计任务，这样可以直接生成适应智能体当前能力的任务。尽管其有很强的理论支持，但PAIRED存在一些挑战，妨碍了其实际性能。因此，目前的最先进方法依赖于策划和变异，而不是生成新任务。在这项工作中，我们研究了PAIRED的几个关键不足之处，并提出了解决方案。因此，我们使PAIRED能够与或超过最先进的方法。",
