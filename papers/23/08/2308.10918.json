    "translated_abstract": "图异常检测近年来引起了广泛的关注。本文介绍了一种新颖的方法，利用基于Metapath的半监督学习，解决了之前方法的局限性。我们提出了一种新的框架，基于Metapath的半监督异常检测（MSAD），在编码器和解码器中都使用GCN层来有效地传播异常和正常节点之间的上下文信息。基于Metapath的上下文信息的设计和特别精心设计的异常社区增强了全局和局部结构和属性差异的学习过程。通过在七个真实网络上进行的一系列综合实验，本文证明了MSAD方法相对于最先进技术的优越性。本研究的有希望的结果为未来的研究铺平了道路，重点是优化和分析Metapath模式以进一步提高方法的效果。",
