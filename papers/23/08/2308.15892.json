    "translated_abstract": "在共同设计环境中，需要快速且自动地集成变更。本文探讨了在共同设计方法下创建和优化用于客机制造的全球物流系统的挑战，考虑关键绩效指标（如成本、时间或韧性）。所讨论的产品是一架客机，由多个组件组成，分别在全球多个地点制造。目标是找到一种最优的方式来建造该飞机，同时考虑其工业系统的需求。解决这一挑战的主要动机是与产品同时开发工业系统，并使其更具韧性以应对意外事件，降低供应链瓶颈的风险。这种风险降低保证了持续的效率和运营成功。为了解决这一具有挑战性和复杂性的任务，我们选择了Answer Set Programming（ASP）作为建模语言，对问题进行形式化。",
