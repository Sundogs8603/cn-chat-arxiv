    "abstract": "Broadband connectivity is regarded as generally having a positive macroeconomic effect, but we lack evidence as to how it affects key economic activity metrics, such as firm creation, at a very local level. This analysis models the impact of broadband Next Generation Access (NGA) on new business creation at the local level over the 2011-2015 period in England, United Kingdom, using high-resolution panel data. After controlling for a range of factors, we find that faster broadband speeds brought by NGA technologies have a positive effect on the rate of business growth. We find that in England between 2011-2015, on average a one percentage increase in download speeds is associated with a 0.0574 percentage point increase in the annual growth rate of business establishments. The primary hypothesised mechanism behind the estimated relationship is the enabling effect that faster broadband speeds have on innovative business models based on new digital technologies and services.

    "translated_abstract": "宽带连接被认为通常对宏观经济产生积极影响，但我们缺乏关于它如何影响关键的经济活动指标（如企业创立）在非常局部的证据。本研究使用高分辨率面板数据，在2011-2015年间对英国的当地层面上建模分析了Next Generation Access (NGA) 宽带对新企业创立的影响。在控制了一系列因素之后，我们发现NGA技术带来的更快的宽带速度对于企业增长率有积极影响。我们发现在2011-2015年期间，英国平均来说，下载速度每增加1个百分点，企业机构的年增长率会增加0.0574个百分点。估计出的关系的主要假设机制是更快的宽带速度对于基于新的数字技术和服务的创新商业模式的推动作用。",
