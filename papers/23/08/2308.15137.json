    "abstract": "As recent advances in AI are causing the decline of conventional diagnostic methods, the realization of end-to-end diagnosis is fast approaching. Ultrasound image segmentation is an important step in the diagnostic process. An accurate and robust segmentation model accelerates the process and reduces the burden of sonographers. In contrast to previous research, we take two inherent features of ultrasound images into consideration: (1) different organs and tissues vary in spatial sizes, (2) the anatomical structures inside human body form a relatively constant spatial relationship. Based on those two ideas, we propose a new image segmentation model combining Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Spatial Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN). We discuss why we use FPN to extract anatomical structures of different scales and how SRNN is implemented to extract the spatial context features in abdominal ultrasound images.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能的进展导致传统诊断方法的衰退，端到端诊断的实现正在迅速接近。超声图像分割是诊断过程中的重要步骤。准确和稳健的分割模型可以加速过程并减轻超声检查师的负担。与以往的研究不同，我们考虑了超声图像的两个内在特征：（1）不同器官和组织的空间尺寸变化，（2）人体内部的解剖结构形成相对恒定的空间关系。基于这两个观点，我们提出了一种新的图像分割模型，结合了特征金字塔网络（FPN）和空间循环神经网络（SRNN）。我们讨论了为什么使用FPN提取不同尺度的解剖结构以及如何实现SRNN来提取腹部超声图像中的空间上下文特征。",
