    "translated_abstract": "融入自然场景的伪装物体给深度学习模型检测和合成带来了重大挑战。伪装物体检测是计算机视觉中一个关键任务，具有广泛的实际应用，然而由于数据有限，该研究课题一直受到限制。我们提出了一个用于合成伪装数据以增强对自然场景中伪装物体检测的框架。我们的方法利用生成模型生成逼真的伪装图像，这些图像可以用来训练现有的物体检测模型。具体而言，我们使用伪装环境生成器，由伪装分布分类器进行监督，合成伪装图像，然后将其输入我们的生成器以扩展数据集。我们的框架在三个数据集（COD10k、CAMO和CHAMELEON）上的效果超过了目前最先进的方法，证明了它在改善伪装物体检测方面的有效性。",
