    "abstract": "The increased digitization of the labour market has given researchers, educators, and companies the means to analyze and better understand the labour market. However, labour market resources, although available in high volumes, tend to be unstructured, and as such, research towards methodologies for the identification, linking, and extraction of entities becomes more and more important. Against the backdrop of this quest for better labour market representations, resource constraints and the unavailability of large-scale annotated data cause a reliance on human domain experts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt-based tuning of pre-trained language models (PLM) in labour market specific applications. Our results indicate that cost-efficient methods such as PTR and instruction tuning without exemplars can significantly increase the performance of PLMs on downstream labour market applications without introducing additional model layers, manual annotations, and data augmentation.",

    "translated_abstract": "劳动力市场的数字化增长使得研究人员、教育者和企业能够分析和更好地理解劳动力市场。然而，尽管劳动力市场资源数量庞大，但往往是非结构化的，因此，对于实体的识别、关联和提取的方法研究变得越来越重要。在追求更好的劳动力市场表现的背景下，资源限制和大规模标注数据不可用导致人类领域专家的依赖。我们证明了基于提示的预训练语言模型（PLM）在劳动力市场特定应用中的有效性。我们的结果表明，PTR和没有示例的指令调整等成本效益方法能够显著提高PLM在劳动力市场应用中的性能，而无需引入额外的模型层、手动注释和数据增强。",
