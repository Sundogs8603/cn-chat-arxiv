    "translated_abstract": "人工神经网络(ANNs)的视觉对象类别报告对微小的对抗性图像扰动非常敏感。由于人类类别报告（又称人类知觉）被认为对同样小范数的扰动不敏感，并且在一般情况下是局部稳定的，这表明ANNs不完全是人类视觉感知的科学模型。与此一致，我们发现当标准ANN模型生成小范数图像扰动时，人类对象类别知觉确实非常稳定。然而，在这个“人类假定稳定”的范围内，我们发现Robustified ANNs可靠地发现低范数图像扰动，这些扰动强烈干扰人类知觉。这些以前无法检测的人类知觉干扰在幅度上是巨大的，接近于Robustified ANNs中观察到的敏感性水平。",
