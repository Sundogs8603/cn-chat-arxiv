    "abstract": "This paper introduces Flamingo, a system for secure aggregation of data across a large set of clients. In secure aggregation, a server sums up the private inputs of clients and obtains the result without learning anything about the individual inputs beyond what is implied by the final sum. Flamingo focuses on the multi-round setting found in federated learning in which many consecutive summations (averages) of model weights are performed to derive a good model. Previous protocols, such as Bell et al. (CCS '20), have been designed for a single round and are adapted to the federated learning setting by repeating the protocol multiple times. Flamingo eliminates the need for the per-round setup of previous protocols, and has a new lightweight dropout resilience protocol to ensure that if clients leave in the middle of a sum the server can still obtain a meaningful result. Furthermore, Flamingo introduces a new way to locally choose the so-called client neighborhood introduced by Bell et al",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了Flamingo，这是一个用于跨大量客户端安全聚合数据的系统。在安全聚合中，服务器对客户端的私有输入进行求和，并在不了解个体输入的情况下得到结果，仅能推断出最终总和。Flamingo专注于联邦学习中的多轮设置，其中执行多个连续的模型权重求和（平均），以得到一个良好的模型。之前的协议（例如Bell等人的CCS '20）仅适用于单轮，并通过多次重复该协议来适应联邦学习的设置。Flamingo消除了之前协议每轮设置的需求，并引入了一种新的轻量级的丢失容忍协议，以确保如果客户端在求和过程中离开，服务器仍然可以获得有意义的结果。此外，Flamingo还引入了一种新的本地选择所谓的客户端邻域的方式，此概念由Bell等人提出。",
