    "translated_abstract": "将原始数据转化为可以驱动决策的信息和知识才能实现其价值。机器学习算法能够分析大型数据集并进行准确的预测。市场细分、客户终身价值和营销技术都已经利用了机器学习。本文研究了营销机器学习技术，如支持向量机、遗传算法、深度学习和K-Means。机器学习用于分析消费者行为、提出物品选择，并在购买产品或服务时做出其他客户决策，但很少用于预测一个人何时购买一个产品或一篮子产品。本文研究了生存模型 Kernel SVM、DeepSurv、Survival Random Forest 和 MTLR，以预测个人购买决策的时间。性别、收入、位置、购买历史、在线行为、兴趣、促销折扣和客户体验都对购买有影响。",
