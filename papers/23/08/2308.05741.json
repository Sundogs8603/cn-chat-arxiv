    "translated_abstract": "最近，可以在手持设备上消费的3D内容的激增需要有效的工具来通过互联网传输大量的几何数据，例如3D网格。详细的高分辨率资源对于存储和传输带宽都是一个挑战，通常使用层次细节技术在适当的带宽预算下传输资源。对于这些方法来说，以渐进的方式传输数据，随着更多数据的加入，改进几何的质量尤其可取。我们的关键观点是，3D网格的几何细节通常在不同的形状之间都呈现出相似的局部模式，因此可以用共享的学习生成空间来有效表示这些细节。我们使用基于细分的编码器-解码器架构提前训练大量表面，在此空间中学习这些细节。我们进一步观察到，在中间细分级别之间可以逐渐传输额外的残余特征，从而实现了渐进式传输和改善几何。",
