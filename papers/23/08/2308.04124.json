Social media are one of the most important sources of citizen opinions. This paper presents a prototype of a framework for processing social media posts with municipal decision-making in mind.

Optionally, the fuzzy number can be reduced into a tuple of two real numbers indicating the \"amount\" of positive and negative opinion expressed towards each topic.

    "translated_abstract": "全球许多城市都希望成为智慧城市，然而，智慧倡议往往对普通市民的意见不太重视。社交媒体是市民意见的重要来源之一。本文提出了一个针对市政决策的社交媒体处理框架原型。该框架包括三个步骤：（1）确定每个社交媒体帖子的情感极性，（2）识别主要话题，并将这些话题映射到个别帖子上，（3）将这两个信息合并为一个表示对每个话题表达的整体情感的模糊数。可选地，这个模糊数可以转化为一个由两个实数元组组成的元组，表示对每个话题表达的“正面”和“负面”观点的“数量”。该框架在捷克奥斯特拉发表的推文上进行了演示，演示期为大约两个月。此应用示例说明了模糊数如何表示对每个话题表达的情感。",
