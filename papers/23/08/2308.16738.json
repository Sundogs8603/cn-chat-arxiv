    "translated_abstract": "超声成像是诊断颈部淋巴结病灶的关键工具。然而，这些图像的诊断主要依赖于医务人员的专业知识，使得这一过程容易出现误诊。尽管迅速发展的深度学习在改进各种超声图像的诊断方面取得了实质性的进展，但在颈部淋巴结方面仍存在明显的研究空白。我们的目标是通过利用深度学习模型准确诊断颈部淋巴结病灶。为此，我们首先收集了3392张正常淋巴结、良性淋巴结病灶、恶性原发淋巴结病灶和恶性转移淋巴结病灶的图像。鉴于超声图像是由声波在不同的身体组织中反射和散射产生的，我们提出了Conv-FFT块。它将卷积操作与快速傅里叶变换相结合，更准确地建模图像。在此基础上构建了...",
