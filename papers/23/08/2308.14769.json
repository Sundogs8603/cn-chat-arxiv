    "translated_abstract": "估计全球约15%的癌症与病毒感染有关。可以引起或增加癌症风险的病毒包括人乳头瘤病毒、乙肝和丙肝病毒、埃普斯坦-巴尔病毒和人类免疫缺陷病毒等。随着测序技术的最新进展，对大量肿瘤DNA数据的计算分析使得研究癌症和病毒病原体之间的潜在关联成为可能。然而，肿瘤病毒家族的高多样性使得可靠检测病毒DNA变得困难，从而使得此类分析具有挑战性。在本文中，我们介绍了一种名为XVir的数据管道，它依赖于基于Transformer的深度学习架构，可可靠地识别人类肿瘤中的病毒DNA。具体而言，XVir是通过对来自病毒和人类基因组的基因组测序读取进行训练的，并可以与肿瘤序列信息一起使用以找到病毒DNA的证据。",
