However, one problem these systems face with modern English is the lack of gender pronouns, where people try to alternate by using masculine, feminine, or plural to avoid the whole issue. Since humanity aims to the building of systems in the full-bodied sense we usually reserve for people, what happens when pronouns in written text, like plural or epicene ones, refer to unspecified entities whose gender is not necessarily known?

    "translated_abstract": "翻阅任何一本书或听任何一首歌词，你会遇到在某些情况下会阻碍理解的代词，特别是对于机器来说。随着认知机器在我们生活中的普及，许多系统已经被开发出来以解决各种挑战下的代词歧义。因此，人们认为能够消除句子中的代词歧义的系统将有助于使机器具备与人类相似的常识和推理能力。然而，这些系统在现代英语中面临的一个问题是缺乏性别代词，人们试图通过使用男性、女性或复数来避免整个问题的出现。由于人类的目标是构建出与人类类似的完整意义上的系统，那么当书面文本中的代词(如复数或中性代词)指的是性别不一定已知的未指定实体时会发生什么呢？",
