    "abstract": "Purpose: In this paper, we present an automated method for article classification, leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLM). The primary focus is on the field of ophthalmology, but the model is extendable to other fields. Methods: We have developed a model based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including advanced LLMs, to process and analyze the textual content of scientific papers. Specifically, we have employed zero-shot learning (ZSL) LLM models and compared against Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART) and its variants, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and its variant such as distilBERT, SciBERT, PubmedBERT, BioBERT. Results: The classification results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMs in categorizing large number of ophthalmology papers without human intervention. Results: To evalute the LLMs, we compiled a dataset (RenD) of 1000 ocular disease-related articles, which were expertly annotated by a pan",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动进行文章分类的方法。主要关注眼科领域，但该模型可扩展到其他领域。通过自然语言处理技术（NLP）开发了一个模型，包括高级LLM，用于处理和分析科学论文的文本内容。在LLM模型中，我们采用了零样本学习（ZSL）LLM模型，并与双向和自回归变换器（BART）及其变种，以及双向编码器表示从变换器（BERT）及其变种（如distilBERT，SciBERT，PubmedBERT，BioBERT）进行比较。分类结果表明，在没有人为干预的情况下，LLM在对大量眼科学论文进行分类方面具有有效性。",
