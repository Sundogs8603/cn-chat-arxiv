    "abstract": "Our interdisciplinary study investigates how effectively U.S. laws confront the challenges posed by Generative AI to human values. Through an analysis of diverse hypothetical scenarios crafted during an expert workshop, we have identified notable gaps and uncertainties within the existing legal framework regarding the protection of fundamental values, such as autonomy, privacy, dignity, diversity, equality, and physical/mental well-being. Constitutional and civil rights, it appears, may not provide sufficient protection against AI-generated discriminatory outputs. Furthermore, even if we exclude the liability shield provided by Section 230, proving causation for defamation and product liability claims is a challenging endeavor due to the intricate and opaque nature of AI systems. To address the unique and unforeseeable threats posed by Generative AI, we advocate for legal frameworks that evolve to recognize new threat and provide proactive, auditable guidelines to industry stakeholders",

    "translated_abstract": "我们的跨学科研究调查了美国法律在面对生成式人工智能对人类价值观挑战时的有效性。通过分析专家研讨会期间制定的多种假设情景，我们发现现有法律框架在保护自主权、隐私权、尊严、多样性、平等以及身心健康等基本价值观方面存在明显的空白和不确定性。宪法和民权法似乎无法对人工智能生成的歧视性产出提供足够的保护。此外，即使我们排除第230条款提供的责任保护，由于人工智能系统的复杂和不透明性，证明诽谤和产品责任索赔的因果关系也是一项具有挑战性的任务。为了应对生成式人工智能带来的独特和难以预测的威胁，我们主张建立能够适应新威胁并为行业利益相关者提供积极、可审计的指导的法律框架。",
