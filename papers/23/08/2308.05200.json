    "translated_abstract": "美元成本平均法(DCA)是一种广泛应用的技术，用于减轻长期投资中对升值资产的波动性。然而，DCA的低效性来源于在不考虑市场状况的情况下固定投资金额。本文介绍了一种更高效的方法，我们称之为SmartDCA，该方法基于价格水平来调整资产购买。SmartDCA的简单性使得我们能够进行严格的数学分析，通过应用Cauchy-Schwartz不等式和Lehmer平均数，我们证明了它的优越性。我们进一步将我们的分析扩展到了我们所称的ρ-SmartDCA，在这种情况下，投资金额被提升到ρ的幂。我们证明了较高的ρ值可以带来更好的性能。然而，这种方法可能导致无限的投资。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了SmartDCA的有界版本，利用了我们称之为准Lehmer平均数的两个新的均值定义。",

It is shown through mathematical analysis that SmartDCA is superior to traditional DCA methods. Additionally, the authors propose two novel mean definitions when introducing a bounded version of SmartDCA to address the issue of unbounded investments."
