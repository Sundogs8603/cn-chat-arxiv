    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了在潜在高维欧几里德空间中优化实值函数的基本任务，例如许多机器学习任务中的损失函数或统计推断中的概率分布的对数。我们使用扭曲黎曼几何概念，将欧几里德空间上的函数优化问题重新定义为一个带有扭曲度量的黎曼流形，并在该流形上找到函数的最优解。选择用于搜索域的扭曲度量引入了一个计算友好的度量张量，使得在流形上找到最优搜索方向与测地线变得更容易计算。沿测地线进行优化通常是不可行的，但我们表明在这个特定的流形中，我们可以解析地得到高达三阶的泰勒近似。一般情况下，这些对测地线的近似不会位于流形上，但我们构造了合适的回缩方程将这些近似重新映射到流形上。",
