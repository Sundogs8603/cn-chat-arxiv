    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了开放领域多跳问答（QA）中查询性能预测（QPP）的问题，任务是估计对语料库进行多跳问题评估的难度。尽管在预测即席和QA检索模型性能方面已经进行了广泛的研究，但对多跳问题难度的评估研究还缺乏。由于检索过程的多步骤性质、步骤之间的潜在依赖关系和推理的复杂性，这个问题具有挑战性。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种新的预检索方法multHP，用于预测开放领域多跳问题的性能。我们对最大的多跳QA数据集进行了广泛评估，使用了几种现代QA系统，结果显示所提出的模型是性能的强有力预测者，优于传统的单跳QPP模型。此外，我们证明了我们的方法可以有效地用于优化QA系统的参数。",
