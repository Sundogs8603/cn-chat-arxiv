    "abstract": "The paper investigates the effect of the label green in bond markets from the lens of the trading activity. The idea is that jumps in the dynamics of returns have a specific memory nature that can be well represented through a self-exciting process. Specifically, using Hawkes processes where the intensity is described through a continuous time moving average model, we study the high-frequency dynamics of bond prices. We also introduce a bivariate extension of the model that deals with the cross-effect of upward and downward price movements. Empirical results suggest that differences emerge if we consider periods with relevant interest rate announcements, especially in the case of an issuer operating in the energy market.",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文从交易活动的角度研究了债券市场中\"绿色\"标签的影响。研究认为，收益动态变化中的跳跃具有特定的记忆性质，可以通过自激励过程很好地表示。具体而言，我们使用霍克斯过程，并通过连续时间移动平均模型描述强度，研究债券价格的高频动态。我们还引入了模型的双变量扩展，处理价格上行和下行运动的交叉效应。实证结果表明，如果考虑与利率公告相关的时间段，尤其是在能源市场中运营的发行人的情况下，差异会出现。",

The study utilizes self-exciting processes and continuous time moving average models to analyze the high-frequency dynamics of bond prices, considering the cross-effect of upward and downward price movements. Empirical results reveal differences, particularly for issuers in the energy market, during periods with relevant interest rate announcements."
