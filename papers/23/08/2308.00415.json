    "abstract": "Performing automatic reformulations of a user's query is a popular paradigm used in information retrieval (IR) for improving effectiveness -- as exemplified by the pseudo-relevance feedback approaches, which expand the query in order to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch problem. Recent advancements in generative language models have demonstrated their ability in generating responses that are relevant to a given prompt. In light of this success, we seek to study the capacity of such models to perform query reformulation and how they compare with long-standing query reformulation methods that use pseudo-relevance feedback. In particular, we investigate two representative query reformulation frameworks, GenQR and GenPRF. GenQR directly reformulates the user's input query, while GenPRF provides additional context for the query by making use of pseudo-relevance feedback information. For each reformulation method, we leverage different techniques, including fine-tuning and direct prompting, ",

    "translated_abstract": "在信息检索（IR）中，自动重构用户查询是一种常用的方法，用于提高效果，如伪相关反馈方法。最近生成式语言模型的进展展示了它们生成与给定提示相关的响应的能力。鉴于这一成功，我们致力于研究这些模型执行查询重构的能力，以及它们与使用伪相关反馈的长期查询重构方法相比较。具体而言，我们研究了两种代表性的查询重构框架，GenQR和GenPRF。GenQR直接重构用户输入的查询，而GenPRF通过使用伪相关反馈信息为查询提供附加上下文。对于每种重构方法，我们采用不同的技术，包括微调和直接提示。",
