    "translated_abstract": "\"潜在结果框架（POF）在因果推断领域中起着重要作用。大多数基于POF的因果推断模型（CIMs-B-POF）旨在消除混淆偏差，并默认存在混淆协变量的基本假设。这一假设认为协变量仅由混淆变量组成。然而，在实践中保持混淆协变量的假设是具有挑战性的，特别是在处理高维协变量时。虽然已经提出了一些方法在进行因果推断之前区分协变量的不同组成部分，但将非混淆的协变量视为混淆变量的后果仍不清楚。这种不确定性在实际场景中应用CIMs-B-POF时存在潜在风险。在本文中，我们提出了一个统一的图形框架，用于理解CIMs-B-POF模型的基本原理。利用这个图形框架，我们对CIMs-B-POF的性能进行了量化分析。\"",
