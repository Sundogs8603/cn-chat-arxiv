    "translated_abstract": "在过去几十年里，人们对药物的消费和组合比以前更多，导致了药物相互作用（DDIs）的增加。为了预测未知的DDIs，最近的研究开始将知识图谱（KGs）纳入考虑，因为它们能够捕捉实体之间的关系，提供比单个药物属性更好的药物表示。在本文中，我们提出了medicX端到端框架，它将来自公共药物库的多个药物特征集成到KG中，并使用各种翻译、分解和基于神经网络（NN）的KG Embedding（KGE）方法对图中的节点进行嵌入。最终，我们使用机器学习（ML）算法预测未知的DDIs。在不同的翻译和分解型KGE模型中，我们发现表现最佳的组合是ComplEx嵌入方法和Long Short-Term Memory（LSTM）网络，它在基于DrugBank的DDIs数据集上获得了95.19%的F1分数。",
