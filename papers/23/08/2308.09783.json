    "abstract": "Unemployment insurance provides temporary cash benefits to eligible unemployed workers. Benefits are sometimes extended by discretion during economic slumps. In a model that features temporary benefits and sequential job opportunities, a worker's reservation wages are studied when policymakers can make discretionary extensions to benefits. A worker's optimal labor-supply choice is characterized by a sequence of reservation wages that increases with weeks of remaining benefits. The possibility of an extension raises the entire sequence of reservation wages, meaning a worker is more selective when accepting job offers throughout their spell of unemployment. The welfare consequences of misperceiving the probability and length of an extension are investigated. In a numerical example, the costs of misperception are small, which has implications for policymakers considering economic slumps, virus pandemics, extreme heat, and natural disasters.",

    "translated_abstract": "失业保险为符合条件的失业工人提供暂时的现金补贴。在经济衰退期间，补贴有时会被自行决定性地延长。在考虑暂时的补贴和连续的工作机会的模型中，研究了政策制定者可以自行决定是否延长补贴时，工人的保留工资。工人的最优劳动供给选择是由一系列随着剩余补贴周数递增的保留工资组成的。延长发放的可能性会提高整个保留工资序列，这意味着工人在失业期间接受工作机会时更加挑剔。研究了错误估计延长发放的概率和时间长度的福利后果。在数值例子中，错误估计的成本较小，这对于考虑经济衰退、病毒大流行、极端高温和自然灾害的政策制定者有影响。",
