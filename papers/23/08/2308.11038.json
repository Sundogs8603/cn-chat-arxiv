    "translated_abstract": "物流集散地在最后一公里配送距离中起着关键作用；即使距离微小增加也会对电子商务行业的业务产生负面影响，同时还会增加其碳足迹。特别是在Covid-19之后，该行业的增长进一步加剧了在城市环境中优化资源分配的需求。在这项研究中，我们使用了一种混合方法来优化物流集散地的布置。该方法依次采用不同的技术。首先，根据它们的空间位置，使用K-Means对交付点进行聚类。聚类方法使用道路网络距离，而不是欧几里德距离。避免使用非基于道路网络的方法，因为它们会导致错误和误导性结果。最后，使用P-Median方法确定集散地的位置。P-Median方法还将交付数量和人口作为权重考虑在内。使用Muller和Phipps（M＆P）的实际交付数据",
