    "abstract": "We present CASSINI, a network-aware job scheduler for machine learning (ML) clusters. CASSINI introduces a novel geometric abstraction to consider the communication pattern of different jobs while placing them on network links. To do so, CASSINI uses an affinity graph that finds a series of time-shift values to adjust the communication phases of a subset of jobs, such that the communication patterns of jobs sharing the same network link are interleaved with each other. Experiments with 13 common ML models on a 24-server testbed demonstrate that compared to the state-of-the-art ML schedulers, CASSINI improves the average and tail completion time of jobs by up to 1.6x and 2.5x, respectively. Moreover, we show that CASSINI reduces the number of ECN marked packets in the cluster by up to 33x.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了CASSINI，一种用于机器学习（ML）集群的网络感知作业调度器。CASSINI引入了一种新颖的几何抽象，以考虑不同作业的通信模式，同时将它们放置在网络链路上。为此，CASSINI使用了一个亲和图，找到一系列的时间偏移值来调整一组作业的通信阶段，使得共享同一网络链路的作业的通信模式相互交错。在一个24台服务器的测试环境中使用13种常见的ML模型进行实验，结果表明，与最先进的ML调度器相比，CASSINI将作业的平均和尾部完成时间分别提高了1.6倍和2.5倍。此外，我们还展示了CASSINI将集群中ECN标记的数据包数量减少了最多33倍。",
