    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于转换器的自然语言处理研究的激增导致了一系列试图在模型中检测人类认知行为存在的研究。我们认为，与人类心理学一样，对语言模型中的认知行为的研究必须在适当规模的适当群体中进行，才能获得有意义的结果。我们利用不确定性估计的工作，采用一种新颖的方法来高效地构建实验群体。由此产生的工具 PopulationLM 已经开源。我们提供了不确定性估计文献中的理论基础，并从当前关于语言模型的认知工作中提供了动机。我们讨论了其他科学界的方法论教训，并试图展示它们在两个人工群体研究中的应用。通过基于群体的实验，我们发现语言模型表现出与典型行为一致的行为。",
