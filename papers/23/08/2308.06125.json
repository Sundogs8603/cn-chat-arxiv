    "abstract": "The last year has seen astonishing progress in text-prompted image generation premised on the idea of a cross-modal representation space in which the text and image domains are represented jointly. In ASR, this idea has found application as joint speech-text encoders that can scale to the capacities of very large parameter models by being trained on both unpaired speech and text. While these methods show promise, they have required special treatment of the sequence-length mismatch inherent in speech and text, either by up-sampling heuristics or an explicit alignment model. In this work, we offer evidence that joint speech-text encoders naturally achieve consistent representations across modalities by disregarding sequence length, and argue that consistency losses could forgive length differences and simply assume the best alignment. We show that such a loss improves downstream WER in both a large-parameter monolingual and multilingual system.",

    "translated_abstract": "过去一年，基于跨模态表示空间的文本引导图像生成取得了令人瞩目的进展，其中文本和图像领域以联合的方式表示。在ASR中，这个想法被应用为联合语音-文本编码器，通过同时训练不匹配的语音和文本，可以扩展到非常大的参数模型的容量。虽然这些方法表现出了希望，但它们需要特殊处理语音和文本之间的序列长度不匹配问题，要么通过上采样启发式方法，要么通过一个显式的对齐模型。在这项工作中，我们提供了证据表明，联合语音-文本编码器通过忽略序列长度自然而然地实现了一致的表示，并且认为一致性损失可以弥补长度差异，并简单地假设最佳对齐。我们展示了这样的损失在大参数单语言和多语言系统中提高了下游的字错误率。",
