    "abstract": "Why do bilingual speakers code-switch (mix their two languages)? Among the several theories that attempt to explain this natural and ubiquitous phenomenon, the Triggering Hypothesis relates code-switching to the presence of lexical triggers, specifically cognates and proper names, adjacent to the switch point. We provide a fuller, more nuanced and refined exploration of the triggering hypothesis, based on five large datasets in three language pairs, reflecting both spoken and written bilingual interactions. Our results show that words that are assumed to reside in a mental lexicon shared by both languages indeed trigger code-switching; that the tendency to switch depends on the distance of the trigger from the switch point; and on whether the trigger precedes or succeeds the switch; but not on the etymology of the trigger words. We thus provide strong, robust, evidence-based confirmation to several hypotheses on the relationships between lexical triggers and code-switching.",

    "translated_abstract": "为什么双语者要进行代码切换（混合两种语言）？在解释这种自然和普遍现象的几种理论中，触发假说将代码切换与切换点附近的词汇触发器（特别是同源词和专有名词）联系起来。我们基于三种语言对的五个大型数据集，反映了口语和书面双语交流，对触发假说进行了更全面、更细致、更精细的探索。我们的结果显示，被认为同时存在于两种语言的共享心理词汇中的词确实触发代码切换；切换的倾向取决于触发器与切换点的距离；以及触发器是在切换之前还是之后；但不取决于触发词的词源。因此，我们对词汇触发器与代码切换之间的关系提供了强有力、稳定、以证据为基础的证实。",
