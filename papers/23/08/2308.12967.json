To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a new approach called NeO 360, Neural fields for sparse view synthesis of outdoor scenes. NeO 360 is a generalizable method that reconstructs 360{\\deg} scenes from a single or a few posed RGB images. The essence of our approach is in capturing the distribution of complex real-world outdoor 3D scenes and using a hybrid image-conditional triplanar representation that can be queried from any world point.

    "translated_abstract": "最近的隐式神经表示方法在新视角合成方面取得了很好的结果。然而，现有方法需要在许多视角下进行昂贵的场景优化，从而限制了它们在真实世界无限制的城市环境中的应用，其中感兴趣的对象或背景只从很少的视角观察到。为了解决这个挑战，我们引入了一种名为NeO 360的新方法，用于稀疏视角合成户外场景。NeO 360是一种通用的方法，可以从单个或少数几个位置的RGB图像重建360度场景。我们方法的核心在于捕获复杂的真实世界户外三维场景的分布，并使用一种混合的图像条件式三平面表示，可以从任何世界点查询。我们的表示方法结合了体素和鸟瞰图表示的优点，比每种表示方法更有效和表达能力更强。NeO 360的表示方法允许我们从一个庞大的无限制的三维数据集中进行学习。",
