    "abstract": "Sequential recommenders have been widely used in industry due to their strength in modeling user preferences. While these models excel at learning a user's positive interests, less attention has been paid to learning from negative user feedback. Negative user feedback is an important lever of user control, and comes with an expectation that recommenders should respond quickly and reduce similar recommendations to the user.

In this work, we incorporate explicit and implicit negative user feedback into the training objective of sequential recommenders in the retrieval stage using a \"not-to-recommend\" loss function that optimizes for the log-likelihood of not recommending items with negative feedback.

    "translated_abstract": "由于其在建模用户偏好方面的优势，顺序推荐系统在工业中被广泛使用。尽管这些模型擅长学习用户的正面兴趣，但对于从负面用户反馈中学习却付出了较少的关注。负面用户反馈是用户控制的重要手段，并伴随着对推荐系统应该快速响应和减少类似推荐的期望。然而，负面反馈信号在顺序检索模型的训练目标中经常被忽视，这些模型主要旨在预测用户的正面交互。在这项工作中，我们使用“不推荐”损失函数将显式和隐式的负面用户反馈纳入顺序推荐系统在检索阶段的训练目标，优化不推荐带有负面反馈的项目的对数似然。我们通过对大规模工业推荐系统进行实时实验来证明这种方法的有效性。",
