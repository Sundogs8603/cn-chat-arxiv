    "translated_abstract": "预测高维视频序列是一个异常困难的问题。由于不确定性，给定视频序列的可能未来数量随着时间的推移呈指数增长。当试图从有限的世界快照中预测复杂的自然视频场景时，这一点尤为明显。固有的不确定性随着预测进入未来而累积，使得长期预测变得非常困难。在这项工作中，我们引入了一些对现有工作的改进，有助于创建稳健的视频预测器（RoViPs）。我们展示出，通过深层感知和基于不确定性的重建损失的组合，我们能够创建高质量的短期预测。利用基于注意力的跳过连接，可以实现输入特征的长程空间移动，进一步提高性能。最后，我们展示，通过使预测器对自身的预测误差具有鲁棒性，可以产生非常长的、逼真的自然视频序列。",
