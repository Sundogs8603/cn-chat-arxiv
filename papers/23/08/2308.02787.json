    "abstract": "The Bin Packing Problem is a classic problem with wide industrial applicability. In fact, the efficient packing of items into bins is one of the toughest challenges in many logistic corporations and is a critical issue for reducing storage costs or improving vehicle space allocation. In this work, we resort to our previously published quantum-classical framework known as Q4RealBPP, and elaborate on the solving of real-world oriented instances of the Bin Packing Problem. With this purpose, this paper gravitates on the following characteristics: i) the existence of heterogeneous bins, ii) the extension of the framework to solve not only three-dimensional, but also one- and two-dimensional instances of the problem, iii) requirements for item-bin associations, and iv) delivery priorities. All these features have been tested in this paper, as well as the ability of Q4RealBPP to solve real-world oriented instances.",

    "translated_abstract": "装箱问题是一个具有广泛工业应用的经典问题。事实上，将物品高效地装箱是许多物流公司面临的最艰巨的挑战之一，也是降低存储成本或改善车辆空间分配的关键问题。本文采用了我们先前发表的量子-经典框架Q4RealBPP，并详细阐述了解决以实际为导向的装箱问题的方法。为此，本文重点关注以下特点：i）存在不同类型的箱子，ii）扩展框架以解决三维、二维和一维问题，iii）物品与箱子关联的要求，iv）交付优先级。本文对所有这些特点进行了测试，以及Q4RealBPP解决以实际为导向的装箱问题的能力。",
