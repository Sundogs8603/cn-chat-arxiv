    "translated_abstract": "用大量标注数据进行全监督的方法在点云语义分割方面取得了卓越的性能。然而，获取具有点级标签的大规模点云数据是一项费力的工作，因此许多尝试致力于探索仅使用有限注释进行学习三维点云分割的方法。主动学习是实现这一目标的有效策略之一，但目前仍未得到充分探索。最近的研究方法通过测量每个预分割区域的不确定性来进行手动标注，但这些方法存在冗余信息，并且需要额外的努力进行区域划分。本文旨在通过开发一种分层基于点的主动学习策略来解决这个问题。具体而言，我们通过一种考虑多个层次上的上下文信息的分层最小边缘不确定性模块来测量每个点的不确定性。然后，设计了一种特征距离抑制策略，选择重要的点进行标注。",
