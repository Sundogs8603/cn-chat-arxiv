    "translated_abstract": "将网络中的节点表示为密集向量节点嵌入对于理解给定网络和解决许多下游任务非常重要。特别是对于权重同质图，其中具有相似节点的边缘权重较大，我们希望节点嵌入中具有强权重的节点对具有更接近的嵌入。虽然基于随机游走的节点嵌入方法，如node2vec和node2vec+，通过将边权重包含在行走转移概率中，可以适用于加权网络，但我们的实验证明嵌入结果不足以反映边权重。在本文中，我们提出了ARGEW（通过图边权重增强的随机游走），这是一种新颖的随机游走增强方法，通过扩展语料库使具有较大边权重的节点最终具有更接近的嵌入。ARGEW可以与任何基于随机游走的节点嵌入方法一起使用，因为它独立于随机采样策略本身并在已有方法的基础上工作。",
