    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19大流行在全球范围内造成了毁灭性的影响，夺走了数百万人的生命，造成了重大的社会和经济中断。为了优化决策并分配有限资源，确定COVID-19的症状并确定每种病例的严重程度非常重要。机器学习算法在医学领域中提供了一种强大的工具，特别是在挖掘临床数据集以获取有用信息和指导科学决策方面。关联规则挖掘是一种从数据中提取隐藏模式的机器学习技术。本文提出了一种基于Apriori算法的关联规则挖掘在COVID-19患者中发现症状模式的应用。该研究使用2875例患者记录，确定了最常见的症状为呼吸暂停（72％）、咳嗽（64％）、发热（59％）、虚弱（18％）、肌肉痛（14.5％）和喉咙痛（12％）。该方法为临床医生提供了有价值的疾病见解，可以帮助他们进行管理和治疗。",
