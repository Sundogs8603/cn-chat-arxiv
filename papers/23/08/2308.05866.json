    "abstract": "Social media posts contain an abundant amount of information about public opinion on major events, especially natural disasters such as hurricanes. Posts related to an event, are usually published by the users who live near the place of the event at the time of the event. Special correlation between the social media data and the events can be obtained using data mining approaches. This paper presents research work to find the mappings between social media data and the severity level of a disaster. Specifically, we have investigated the Twitter data posted during hurricanes Harvey and Irma, and attempted to find the correlation between the Twitter data of a specific area and the hurricane level in that area. Our experimental results indicate a positive correlation between them. We also present a method to predict the hurricane category for a specific area using relevant Twitter data.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体帖子包含大量关于公众对重大事件的观点信息，尤其是自然灾害如飓风。与事件相关的帖子通常是由居住在事件发生地附近的用户在事件发生时发布的。可以使用数据挖掘方法获得社交媒体数据与事件之间的特殊相关性。本文介绍了一项研究工作，旨在找到社交媒体数据与灾害严重程度之间的映射关系。具体而言，我们调查了飓风哈维和欧文期间发布的Twitter数据，并尝试找到特定地区的Twitter数据与该地区的飓风级别之间的关联。我们的实验结果表明它们之间存在正相关性。我们还提出了一种使用相关的Twitter数据来预测特定地区飓风等级的方法。",
