    "translated_abstract": "连续终身学习是一种受人类学习启发的机器学习框架，学习者会以顺序方式持续获取新知识。然而，流式训练数据的非稳态性给这个过程带来了一个重要挑战，即灾难性遗忘，指的是在引入新任务时快速遗忘先前学习的知识。虽然一些方法，如经验重播(ER)，已被提出来缓解这个问题，但它们的性能仍然有限，尤其在增量分类场景中，这被认为是自然而极具挑战性的。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的算法，称为自适应经验重播(AdaER)，以解决连续终身学习的挑战。AdaER包括两个阶段：记忆重播和记忆更新。在记忆重播阶段，AdaER引入了一种上下文提示的记忆回忆策略(C-CMR)，选择性地重播最冲突的记忆。",
