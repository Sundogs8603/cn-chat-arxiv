    "translated_abstract": "物联网生态系统能够利用大量数据进行智能决策。联邦学习（FL）是一种分散式机器学习技术，广泛用于从各种分布式数据源中收集和训练机器学习模型。物联网和联邦学习系统可以相互补充并共同使用。然而，物联网设备资源有限的特性限制了FL在现实世界中的大规模部署。本研究论文从客户端和服务器两个层面，全面调研了在资源受限的物联网环境中实施联邦学习（FL）面临的挑战和解决方案。我们关注有关有限的客户端资源、异构客户端数据存在、服务器容量和高通信成本的解决方案，并评估了它们在不同场景中的有效性。此外，我们根据应用位置（即物联网客户端和FL服务器）对这些解决方案进行了分类。",
