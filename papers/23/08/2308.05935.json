    "abstract": "Teaching assistants have played essential roles in the long history of education. However, few MOOC platforms are providing human or virtual teaching assistants to support learning for massive online students due to the complexity of real-world online education scenarios and the lack of training data. In this paper, we present a virtual MOOC teaching assistant, LittleMu with minimum labeled training data, to provide question answering and chit-chat services. Consisting of two interactive modules of heterogeneous retrieval and language model prompting, LittleMu first integrates structural, semi- and unstructured knowledge sources to support accurate answers for a wide range of questions. Then, we design delicate demonstrations named \"Chain of Teach\" prompts to exploit the large-scale pre-trained model to handle complex uncollected questions. Except for question answering, we develop other educational services such as knowledge-grounded chit-chat. We test the system's performance via bot",

    "translated_abstract": "在教育的漫长历史中，助教在学习中发挥了重要作用。然而，由于真实在线教育场景的复杂性和缺乏训练数据，很少有MOOC平台提供人工或虚拟助教来支持大量在线学生的学习。在本文中，我们提出了一个虚拟的MOOC助教LittleMu，仅使用少量标注训练数据，提供问题回答和闲聊服务。LittleMu由两个交互模块组成，包括异构检索和语言模型提示，首先整合结构化、半结构化和非结构化的知识源，支持广泛范围的问题的准确回答。然后，我们设计了名为“Chain of Teach”提示的精心示范，利用大规模预训练模型处理复杂的未收集问题。除了问题回答，我们还开发了其他教育服务，如知识相关的闲聊。我们通过机器人测试系统的性能。",
