    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种受限斯坦变分轨迹优化（CSVTO）算法，用于在一组轨迹上进行带约束的轨迹优化。我们将受限轨迹优化视为一种新颖的对轨迹分布约束的函数最小化形式，避免将约束视为目标函数的惩罚，从而使我们能够生成多样的满足约束的轨迹集合。我们的方法使用斯坦变分梯度下降（SVGD）寻找一组粒子，近似表示一个低成本轨迹的分布，并遵守约束。CSVTO适用于具有任意等式和不等式约束的问题，并包括一种新颖的粒子重新采样步骤来避免局部最小值。通过明确生成多样的轨迹集合，CSVTO能够更好地避免不良的局部最小值，并且对初始化更具鲁棒性。我们证明，CSVTO在具有高度约束的挑战性问题上优于基线方法。",
