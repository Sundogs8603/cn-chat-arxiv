    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型在自然语言处理方面取得了进展，但它们在需要正式语言理解的复杂推理任务（如国际象棋）方面的熟练程度仍受到较少的研究。本文通过使用国际象棋作为案例研究，探究了OpenAI的高级语言模型ChatGPT在处理这种复杂推理任务上的表现。通过检查移动的合法性和质量等稳健指标，我们评估了ChatGPT对国际象棋棋盘的理解能力、对国际象棋规则的遵守情况以及战略决策能力。我们的评估发现了ChatGPT关注机制的局限性，影响其对正式语言的理解，并揭示了该模型未发展完善的自我调节能力。我们的研究还揭示了ChatGPT在游戏中的一致战略倾向以及当模型面对更多自然语言或具有更清晰理解能力时，决策自信度的明显增加。",
