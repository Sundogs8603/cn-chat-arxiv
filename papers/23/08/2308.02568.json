    "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of the approach we used as team ISISTANITOS for the ACM RecSys Challenge 2023. The competition was organized by ShareChat, and involved predicting the probability of a user clicking an app ad and/or installing an app, to improve deep funnel optimization and a special focus on user privacy. Our proposed method inferring the probabilities of clicking and installing as two different, but related tasks. Hence, the model engineers a specific set of features for each task and a set of shared features. Our model is called Weighted Multi-Level Feature Factorization because it considers the interaction of different order features, where the order is associated to the depth in a neural network. The prediction for a given task is generated by combining the task specific and shared features on the different levels. Our submission achieved the 11 rank and overall score of 55 in the competition academia-track final results. We release our source code at: https://githu",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文提供了团队ISISTANITOS在ACM RecSys Challenge 2023中所使用的方法概述。该竞赛由ShareChat组织，涉及预测用户点击应用程序广告和/或安装应用程序的概率，以改善深度漏斗优化，并特别关注用户隐私。我们提出的方法将点击和安装的概率推断为两个不同但相关的任务。因此，模型根据不同任务和一组共享特征工程化了一组特定特征。我们的模型称为加权多级特征分解，因为它考虑到不同级别特征的交互，其中级别与神经网络中的深度相关。给定任务的预测是通过在不同级别上组合任务特定和共享特征来生成的。我们在学术领域的比赛中获得了11名和55的总体得分。我们在以下网址发布了源代码：https://githu",
