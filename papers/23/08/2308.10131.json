    "abstract": "Based on a record of dissents on FOMC votes and transcripts of the meetings from 1976 to 2017, we develop a deep learning model based on self-attention modules to create a measure of the level of disagreement for each member in each meeting. While dissents are rare, we find that members often have reservations with the policy decision. The level of disagreement is mostly driven by current or predicted macroeconomic data, and personal characteristics of the members play almost no role. We also use our model to evaluate speeches made by members between meetings, and we find a weak correlation between the level of disagreement revealed in them and that of the following meeting. Finally, we find that the level of disagreement increases whenever monetary policy action is more aggressive.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于1976年至2017年的FOMC投票异议记录和会议记录，我们开发了一个基于自我关注模块的深度学习模型，用于确定每个成员在每个会议中的异议程度。虽然异议很少见，但我们发现成员们经常对政策决策持保留意见。异议程度主要由当前或预测的宏观经济数据驱动，成员的个人特征几乎不起作用。我们还利用模型评估会议之间成员的演讲，并发现它们所揭示的异议程度与随后的会议异议程度之间存在弱相关性。最后，我们发现每当货币政策行动更加激进时，异议程度会增加。",

It finds that while dissents are rare, members often have reservations with the policy decision. Disagreement is primarily driven by current or predicted macroeconomic data, with personal characteristics of the members playing little role. The study also reveals a weak correlation between the level of disagreement in member speeches and subsequent meetings. Additionally, it demonstrates that disagreement increases when monetary policy action is more aggressive."
