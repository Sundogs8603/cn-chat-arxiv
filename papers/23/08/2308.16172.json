    "translated_abstract": "本研究侧重于对具有同时时间和空间依赖性的数据进行非参数回归函数的估计。在这种情况下，我们研究了趋势滤波，这是一种非参数估计方法，由Mammen和Rudin提出。在单变量设置中，我们考虑的信号假设具有有界总变异度的k次弱导数，允许一定程度的平滑性。在多变量情况下，我们研究了Padilla等人的K最近邻融合套索估计器，采用适用于具有有界变异度且符合分段利普希茨连续性准则的信号的ADMM算法。通过与下界对齐，我们验证了我们估计器的极小化性。通过分析，我们发现了以往趋势滤波研究中未曾探索过的独特相变现象。仿真研究和实际数据应用都突出了我们方法的出色性能。",
