    "translated_abstract": "尽管深度学习领域取得了相当大的进展，但过拟合依然是一个关键的挑战。数据增强作为一种十分有前景的方法，因其能够增强模型在各种计算机视觉任务中的泛化能力而备受关注。虽然已经提出了各种各样的策略，但混合样本数据增强（MSDA）在增强模型性能和泛化能力方面显示出了巨大潜力。我们引入了一种称为MiAMix的新型混合方法，即多阶段增强混合。MiAMix将图像增强集成到混合框架中，同时利用多种多样的混合方法，并通过随机选择混合掩模增强方法来改进混合方法。最近的方法利用了显著性信息，而MiAMix的设计也考虑到了计算效率，减少了额外的开销，并且可以轻松集成到现有的训练流程中。我们对MiAMix进行了全面的评估，使用了四个图像基准和进行了比较。",
