    "translated_abstract": "AI for science (AI4S)是一个新兴的研究领域，旨在使用机器学习方法提高科学计算任务的准确性和速度。传统的AI基准方法在适应AI4S领域的独特挑战上存在困难，因为它们假设训练、测试和未来的真实查询数据是独立同分布的，而AI4S工作负载则预期存在分布不同的问题实例。本文以机器学习势场（MLFF）为案例研究，探讨了有效评估AI for science需要新方法的必要性。MLFF是一种低计算成本和高精度的加速分子动力学（MD）模拟的方法。我们发现在科学意义上的基准测试中存在各种错失的机会，并提出解决方案来评估MLFF模型的样本效率、时间域敏感性和跨数据集的泛化能力。",
