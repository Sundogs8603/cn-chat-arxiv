    "abstract": "The next generation of telescopes will yield a substantial increase in the availability of high-resolution spectroscopic data for thousands of exoplanets. The sheer volume of data and number of planets to be analyzed greatly motivate the development of new, fast and efficient methods for flagging interesting planets for reobservation and detailed analysis. We advocate the application of machine learning (ML) techniques for anomaly (novelty) detection to exoplanet transit spectra, with the goal of identifying planets with unusual chemical composition and even searching for unknown biosignatures. We successfully demonstrate the feasibility of two popular anomaly detection methods (Local Outlier Factor and One Class Support Vector Machine) on a large public database of synthetic spectra. We consider several test cases, each with different levels of instrumental noise. In each case, we use ROC curves to quantify and compare the performance of the two ML techniques.",

    "translated_abstract": "下一代望远镜将提供大量高分辨率光谱数据，用于分析数千个系外行星。庞大的数据量和需要分析的行星数量极大地推动了开发新的、快速高效的方法，用于标记有趣的行星以供重新观测和详细分析。我们提倡将机器学习技术应用于系外行星凌星光谱的异常（新颖性）检测，目标是识别具有异常化学成分甚至寻找未知的生物标记。我们成功地展示了两种常见的异常检测方法（局部离群因子和一类支持向量机）在大型公共数据库的合成光谱上的可行性。我们考虑了几种测试情况，每种情况都有不同水平的仪器噪声。在每种情况下，我们使用ROC曲线来量化和比较两种机器学习技术的性能。",
