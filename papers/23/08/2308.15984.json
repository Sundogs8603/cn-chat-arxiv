    "translated_abstract": "本文通过使用图注意力网络解决学习结构运动（SfM）的问题。SfM是一个经典的计算机视觉问题，通过迭代最小化重投影误差（称为束调整）解决，从良好的初始化开始。为了获得足够好的初始化结果，传统方法依赖于一系列子问题（如成对姿态估计、姿态平均化或三角测量），这些子问题提供了一个初始解，然后使用束调整对其进行改进。在本文中，我们通过学习一个模型，将这些子问题替换为以多个视图上检测到的2D关键点作为输入，并输出相应的相机姿态和3D关键点坐标。我们的模型利用图神经网络学习SfM特定的原语，并且我们展示它可以用于快速推断新的和未见过的序列的重建。实验结果表明，所提出的模型可以显著提高结构运动的学习性能。",
