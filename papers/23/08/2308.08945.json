    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界的应用中，表格格式的数据经常出现。图神经网络（GNNs）近期被扩展以有效处理此类数据，通过表示学习捕捉特征之间的相互作用。然而，这些方法本质上产生了黑盒模型，以深度神经网络的形式存在，使得用户无法理解模型预测的逻辑。我们提出了一种称为IGNNet（基于图神经网络的可解释表格数据处理方法）的方法，它限制学习算法以产生可解释的模型，该模型展示了如何从原始输入特征准确计算预测结果。通过大规模实证研究，我们展示了IGNNet与面向表格数据的最先进机器学习算法（包括XGBoost，Random Forests和TabNet）性能相当。同时，结果显示从IGNNet获得的解释与真实情况一致。",
