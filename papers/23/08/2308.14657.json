Artificial intelligence technology has emerged as a promising solution to accurately predict obesity rates and provide personalized feedback to adolescents. This study emphasizes the importance of early identification and prevention of obesity-related health issues. Factors such as height, weight, waist circumference, calorie intake, physical activity levels, and other relevant health information need to be considered for developing robust algorithms for obesity rate prediction and delivering personalized feedback. Hence, by collecting health datasets from 321 adolescents, we proposed an adolescent obesity prediction system that provides personalized predictions and assists individuals in making informed health decisions. Our proposed deep learning framework, DeepHealthNet, effectively trains the model using data augmentation techniques, even when ",
