This paper introduces an approach to link prediction in Wikipedia articles by formulating it as a natural language inference (NLI) task. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in natural language processing and understanding, we cast link prediction as an NLI task, wherein the presence of a link between two articles is treated as a premise, and the task is to determine whether this premise holds based on the information presented in the articles. We implemented our system based on the Sentence Pair Classification for Link Prediction for the Wikipedia Articles task. Our system achieved 0.99996 Macro F1-score and 1.00000 Macro F1-s",

    "translated_abstract": "链接预测任务对于自动理解大型知识库的结构至关重要。本文介绍了我们在数据科学和高级分析2023年竞赛“高效和有效的链接预测”（DSAA-2023竞赛）中用包含948,233个训练样本和238,265个用于公共测试的语料库解决这一任务的系统。本文引入了一种将维基百科文章的链接预测问题建模为自然语言推理任务（NLI）的方法。受到近期自然语言处理和理解方面的进展启发，我们将链接预测作为一个NLI任务，其中将两个文章之间的链接存在视为前提，任务是基于文章中呈现的信息来确定该前提是否成立。我们的系统是基于用于维基百科文章链接预测的句对分类的实现。我们的系统实现了0.99996的Macro F1-score和1.00000的Macro F1-score。",
