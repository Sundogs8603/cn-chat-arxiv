    "abstract": "Few-shot and zero-shot entity linking focus on the tail and emerging entities, which are more challenging but closer to real-world scenarios. The mainstream method is the ''retrieve and rerank'' two-stage framework. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine lexicon-based retriever to retrieve entity candidates in an effective manner, which operates in two layers. The first layer retrieves coarse-grained candidates by leveraging entity names, while the second layer narrows down the search to fine-grained candidates within the coarse-grained ones. In addition, this second layer utilizes entity descriptions to effectively disambiguate tail or new entities that share names with existing popular entities. Experimental results indicate that our approach can obtain superior performance without requiring extensive finetuning in the retrieval stage. Notably, our approach ranks the 1st in NLPCC 2023 Shared Task 6 on Chinese Few-shot and Zero-shot Entity Linking.",

    "translated_abstract": "少样本和零样本实体链接关注尾部和新兴实体，这更具挑战性但更接近真实场景。主流方法是“检索和重排序”两阶段框架。本文提出了一种粗到细的基于词典的检索器，以有效地检索实体候选项，它在两层进行操作。第一层利用实体名称检索粗粒度候选项，而第二层在粗粒度候选项中缩小搜索范围到细粒度候选项。此外，第二层使用实体描述来有效消除与现有热门实体同名的尾部或新实体的歧义。实验结果表明，我们的方法能够在不需要大量微调的情况下获得优越的性能。值得注意的是，我们的方法在NLPCC 2023共享任务6上中文少样本和零样本实体链接中排名第一。",
