    "translated_abstract": "检索已经被澄清的叙述的任务旨在检测已经经过事实核查的故事。成功检测到已被澄清的声明不仅减少了专业事实核查人员的手动努力，还可以有助于减缓虚假信息的传播。由于缺乏可用数据，这是一个研究不足的问题，特别是在考虑跨语言任务时，即在检查的在线帖子的语言与事实核查文章的语言不同的情况下进行检索。本文通过以下方式填补了这一空白：（i）创建了一个新颖的数据集，以允许对已被澄清的叙述进行跨语言检索的研究，使用推文作为对事实核查文章数据库的查询；（ii）展示了一个全面的实验，以评估经过微调和现成的多语言预训练Transformer模型在这个任务上的性能；（iii）提出了一个新颖的多阶段框架，将这个跨语言澄清检索问题划分为不同的阶段。",
