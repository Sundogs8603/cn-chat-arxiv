    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the statistical analysis of shapes of data objects called shape graphs, a set of nodes connected by articulated curves with arbitrary shapes. A critical need here is a constrained registration of points (nodes to nodes, edges to edges) across objects. This, in turn, requires optimization over the permutation group, made challenging by differences in nodes (in terms of numbers, locations) and edges (in terms of shapes, placements, and sizes) across objects. This paper tackles this registration problem using a novel neural-network architecture and involves an unsupervised loss function developed using the elastic shape metric for curves. This architecture results in (1) state-of-the-art matching performance and (2) an order of magnitude reduction in the computational cost relative to baseline approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using both simulated data and real-world 2D and 3D shape graphs. Code and data will be made publicly avail",

    "translated_abstract": "本文主要研究数据对象形状图的统计分析，即由连接着任意形状的曲线的节点集合。这里的关键需求是跨对象进行点（节点到节点，边到边）的受限制注册。这又需要在排列群上进行优化，给定节点（数量、位置）和边（形状、放置、大小）在对象之间存在差异的挑战。本文使用一种新颖的神经网络架构解决了这个注册问题，并采用弹性形状度量曲线开发了无监督损失函数。该架构在匹配性能方面效果显著，而且相对于基准方法，在计算成本上降低了一个数量级。我们使用模拟数据和真实的2D和3D形状图验证了所提出的方法的有效性。代码和数据将公开提供。",
