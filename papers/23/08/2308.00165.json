    "translated_abstract": "法律判断预测是根据案情描述来预测法院案件结果的任务。这些任务应用自然语言处理技术来基于事实预测法律判断结果。最近，大规模公开数据集和自然语言处理模型已经增加了与法律判断预测系统相关的研究。为了使这种系统在实践中有所帮助，它们应该能够抵御对抗性攻击。先前的工作主要集中在构建神经法律判断系统上，但对于创建鲁棒的法律判断预测系统（LJP）几乎没有给予足够的关注。我们对早期存在的LJP系统进行了对抗性攻击实验，并发现它们都无法处理攻击。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种构建鲁棒LJP系统的方法。在三个法律数据集上进行的大量实验表明，我们的方法在处理对抗性攻击方面明显优于现有最先进的LJP系统。",
