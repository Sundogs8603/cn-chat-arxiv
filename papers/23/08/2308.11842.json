In this paper, we focus on exploiting Euclidean symmetries inherent in certain cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems and prevalent in many applications. We begin by formally characterizing a subclass of Markov games with a general notion of symmetries that admits the existence of symmetric optimal values and policies. Motivated by these properties, we design neural network architectures with symmetric constraints embedded as an inductive bias for multi-agent actor-critic methods. This inductive bias results in superior performance in various cooperative MARL benchmarks and impressive generalization capabilities such as zero-shot learning and transfer learning in unseen scenarios with repeated symmetric patterns.",

    "translated_abstract": "在自然界中识别和分析对称模式已经在各个科学领域取得了重要的发现，例如物理学中的引力定律的制定和化学结构研究的进展。本文着重于利用在某些协作多智体强化学习（MARL）问题中固有的欧几里德对称性，以及在许多应用中普遍存在的对称性。我们首先通过形式化地描述一类具有一般对称性概念的马尔可夫博弈，该概念允许存在对称的最优值和策略。受到这些性质的启发，我们设计了具有对称约束的神经网络结构，作为多智体演员-评论家方法的归纳偏差。这种归纳偏差在各种协作MARL基准测试中表现出卓越的性能，并具有零样本学习和在具有重复对称模式的未见场景中的迁移学习等令人印象深刻的泛化能力。",
