    "translated_abstract": "心电图 (ECG) 是一种广泛可用的诊断工具，可以快速和经济高效地评估心血管健康状况。然而，在心血管疾病的诊断中，通常更喜欢使用昂贵的心脏磁共振 (CMR) 成像进行更详细的检查。虽然 CMR 成像可以提供详细的心脏解剖可视化，但由于长时间扫描和高昂的费用，它并不广泛可用。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种第一种自监督对比方法，将CMR图像中的领域特定信息转移到ECG嵌入中。我们的方法将多模态对比学习与屏蔽数据建模相结合，实现了仅根据ECG数据进行全面的心脏筛查。在使用来自40044名UK Biobank受试者的数据进行的广泛实验证明了我们方法的实用性和可推广性。我们预测了各种心血管疾病的个体风险，并仅根据ECG数据确定了不同的心脏表型。",
