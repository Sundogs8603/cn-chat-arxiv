To address these limitations, this work proposes a constrained multi-objective optimization (MOO) framework, called BREATHE, that searches not only traditional vector-based design spaces but also graph-based design spaces to obtain best-performing graphs. It leverages second-order gradients and actively trains a heteroscedastic surrogate model for sample-efficient optimization. In a single-objective vector optimization application, it leads to 64.1% higher performance than the next-best baseline, random forest regression.

    "translated_abstract": "研究人员在各种科学研究和物理实验中不断努力探索更大更复杂的搜索空间。然而，这些调查往往涉及复杂的模拟器或耗时的实验，使得探索和观察新的设计样本变得困难。旨在应对这些局限的先前工作通常是样本低效的，并且局限于向量搜索空间。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种约束多目标优化（MOO）框架，称为BREATHE，它不仅搜索传统的基于向量的设计空间，还搜索基于图的设计空间以获取表现最佳的图形。它利用二阶梯度并主动训练异方差模型以实现样本高效的优化。在单目标向量优化应用中，其性能比随机森林回归等下一个最佳基准模型提高了64.1％。在基于图的搜索中，BREATHE优于下一个最佳的基准模型。",
