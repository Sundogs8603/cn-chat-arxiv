    "translated_abstract": "视频语义角色标注(VidSRL)旨在通过识别预测-参数事件结构和事件之间的相互关系，从给定的视频中检测出显著的事件。尽管最近的努力已经提出了VidSRL的方法，但它们主要存在两个关键缺点，包括缺乏细粒度的空间场景感知和不足的视频时间建模。为了解决这个问题，本文基于现有的动态场景图结构，探索了一种新颖的全面的时空场景图(Holistic Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph)表示，很好地模拟了视频的细粒度空间语义和时间动态特性以进行VidSRL。在Holistic Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph的基础上，我们提出了一种面向特定目标的VidSRL框架。首先设计了一种场景-事件映射机制，以弥合底层场景结构与高级事件语义结构之间的差距，形成一个整体层次的场景-事件(ICE)图结构。我们进一步进行迭代操作以逐步改进VidSRL性能。",
