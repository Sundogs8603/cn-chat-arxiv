    "translated_abstract": "目标中心表示学习通过明确地将图像场景解析为其组成部分，克服了图像级表示的局限性。然而，图像级表示通常对自然图像破坏缺乏鲁棒性，而目标中心方法的鲁棒性尚未得到广泛测试。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了RobustCLEVR基准数据集和评估框架。我们的框架通过在专家知识基础上启用图像生成过程中因果依赖性的规定，并能够产生一系列在现有鲁棒性评估中无法获得的图像破坏，以一种全新的方式评估鲁棒性。使用我们的框架，我们定义了几种图像破坏过程的因果模型，这些模型明确编码了每种破坏类型的因果关系和分布的假设。我们为每个因果模型生成数据集变体，并在上面评估各种最先进的方法。",
