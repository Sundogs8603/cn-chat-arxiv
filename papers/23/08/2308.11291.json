    "abstract": "The quality of a wood log in the wood industry depends heavily on the presence of both outer and inner defects, including inner knots that are a result of the growth of tree branches. Today, locating the inner knots require the use of expensive equipment such as X-ray scanners. In this paper, we address the task of predicting the location of inner defects from the outer shape of the logs. The dataset is built by extracting both the contours and the knots with X-ray measurements. We propose to solve this binary segmentation task by leveraging convolutional recurrent neural networks. Once the neural network is trained, inference can be performed from the outer shape measured with cheap devices such as laser profilers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on fir and spruce tree species and perform ablation on the recurrence to demonstrate its importance.",

    "translated_abstract": "木材行业中木材原结的质量主要取决于内外缺陷的存在，其中内部节疤是树枝生长的结果。目前，定位内部节疤需要使用昂贵的设备，如X射线扫描仪。本文解决了通过木材外形预测内部缺陷位置的任务。数据集通过利用X射线测量提取轮廓和节疤构建。我们提出了使用卷积循环神经网络解决这个二分类分割任务的方法。一旦神经网络训练完毕，可以使用廉价设备（如激光剖面仪）测量的外形进行推理。我们在冷杉和云杉树种上验证了我们方法的有效性，并对循环的重要性进行了消融实验证明。",
