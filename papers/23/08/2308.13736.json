    "abstract": "In recent years, AI-generated music has made significant progress, with several models performing well in multimodal and complex musical genres and scenes. While objective metrics can be used to evaluate generative music, they often lack interpretability for musical evaluation. Therefore, researchers often resort to subjective user studies to assess the quality of the generated works, which can be resource-intensive and less reproducible than objective metrics. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the subjective, objective, and combined methodologies for assessing AI-generated music, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. Ultimately, this study provides a valuable reference for unifying generative AI in the field of music evaluation.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，AI生成的音乐取得了显著进展，在多模态和复杂的音乐流派和场景中表现出良好的性能。虽然可以使用客观度量指标评估生成音乐，但它们往往在音乐评估方面缺乏解释性。因此，研究人员常常依赖主观用户研究来评估生成作品的质量，但这种方法需要耗费资源，并且比客观度量指标更难复现。本研究旨在全面评估主观、客观和综合方法，用于评估AI生成音乐，并突出每种方法的优势和劣势。最终，本研究为在音乐评估领域统一生成AI提供了有价值的参考。",
