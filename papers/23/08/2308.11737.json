    "translated_abstract": "准确估计3D姿态和形状是理解动物行为的重要一步，对于野生动物保护等许多下游应用有潜在好处。然而，这个领域的研究受到缺乏包含高质量3D姿态和形状注释的全面多样数据集的限制。在本文中，我们提出了Animal3D，这是一个用于哺乳动物动物3D姿态和形状估计的首个全面数据集。Animal3D由来自40个哺乳动物物种的3379个图像组成，包含26个关键点的高质量注释，以及SMAL模型的姿态和形状参数。所有注释都经过多阶段手工标注和检查，以确保最高质量的结果。基于Animal3D数据集，我们对代表性的形状和姿态估计模型进行了以下基准测试：（1）只使用Animal3D数据的监督学习，（2）从合成生成的图像进行合成到真实的转移，（3）微调人体姿势和形状估计模型。",
