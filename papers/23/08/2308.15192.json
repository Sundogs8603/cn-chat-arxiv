    "translated_abstract": "在当今社交媒体的环境下，大量用户表达负面情绪，其中一些表现为强烈的自杀倾向。这种情况凸显了对训练有素的心理咨询师的迫切需求，他们可以实施有效的心理干预。然而，培养这些专业人员常常是一项必要但耗时的任务。因此，动员非专业人员或志愿者在这方面发挥作用成为一个紧迫的问题。利用人工智能的能力，尤其是大型语言模型的最新进展，为此挑战提供了可行的解决方案。本文介绍了一个基于大型语言模型构建的新型模型，以充分辅助非专业人员在在线用户交流中提供心理干预。该框架使得合理利用非专业咨询师的力量变得可行。进行了一项综合研究。",
    "tldr": "本研究基于大型语言模型构建了一个决策支持系统，可帮助非专业人员在社交媒体上提供心理咨询，从而弥补了专业咨询师短缺的问题。",
