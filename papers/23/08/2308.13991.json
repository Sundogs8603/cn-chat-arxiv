    "translated_abstract": "为了克服在具有大量类别的大维度数据分类中的困难，我们提出了一种名为JLSPCADL的新方法。本文利用Johnson-Lindenstrauss(JL)引理，在一个转换空间中选择一个维数，可以在其中学习用于信号分类的判别式字典。与通常使用JL进行降维的随机投影不同，我们使用从Modified Supervised PC Analysis (M-SPCA)推导得出的投影转换矩阵，其维数遵循JL的规定。JLSPCADL提供了一种启发式方法来推断适当的失真水平和相应的字典原子的适当描述长度(SDL)，以推导出一个最优的特征空间，从而提供更好的分类的字典原子的SDL。与最先进的基于降维的字典学习方法不同，从M-SPCA中一步得出的投影转换矩阵提供了最大的特征-标签一致性。",
