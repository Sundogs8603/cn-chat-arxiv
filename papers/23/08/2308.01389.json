    "abstract": "Nowadays, autonomous cars are gaining traction due to their numerous potential applications on battlefields and in resolving a variety of other real-world challenges. The main goal of our project is to build an autonomous system using DeepRacer which will follow a specific person (for our project, a soldier) when they will be moving in any direction. Two main components to accomplish this project is an optimized Single-Shot Multibox Detection (SSD) object detection model and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model. We accomplished the task using SSD Lite instead of SSD and at the end, compared the results among SSD, SSD with Neural Computing Stick (NCS), and SSD Lite. Experimental results show that SSD Lite gives better performance among these three techniques and exhibits a considerable boost in inference speed (~2-3 times) without compromising accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "如今，由于在战场上和解决各种现实世界的挑战都有许多潜在应用，自动驾驶汽车正变得越来越受关注。我们项目的主要目标是使用DeepRacer构建一个自主系统，该系统将在士兵（项目中的特定人物）在任何方向移动时追踪他们。实现此项目的两个主要组成部分是优化的单次多框检测（SSD）目标检测模型和强化学习（RL）模型。我们使用SSD Lite而不是SSD完成了任务，并最终比较了SSD、具有神经计算棒（NCS）的SSD和SSD Lite的结果。实验结果表明SSD Lite在这三种技术中表现更好，并且在不降低准确性的情况下，推理速度提高了约2-3倍。",
