    "translated_abstract": "虽然人工智能在医学图像分析中的应用获得了广泛的认可，但由于数据和专家注释的有限可用性，医学领域生成注释数据所需的专业知识、时间和成本显著高。强监督目标定位模型需要详尽注释的数据，这意味着需要识别图像中所有感兴趣的对象。对于医学图像而言，这是难以实现和验证的。我们提出了一种将真实数据转化为训练任何深度神经网络解决上述问题的方法。我们展示了这种方法在弱监督定位模型和强监督定位模型上的有效性。对于弱监督模型，我们展示了使用生成的数据明显提高了定位准确性。对于强监督模型，这种方法克服了对真实图像的详尽注释的需求。在后者模型中，我们展示了...",
