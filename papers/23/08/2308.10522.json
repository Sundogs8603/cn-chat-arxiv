    "translated_abstract": "多视图表示学习旨在从多个视图中捕获共享上下文的全面信息。最近的研究直观地将对比学习应用于不同视图的成对方式，这仍然可扩展：学习视图共享表示时未过滤视图特定的噪声；虚假的负对中，负项实际上在同一类别中与正项相同，并且真正的负对被同等对待；均匀地衡量术语之间的相似性可能干扰优化。重要的是，很少有工作研究广义自监督多视图学习的理论框架，特别是针对多于两个视图的情况。为此，我们从信息理论的视角重新思考了现有的多视图学习范式，然后提出了一个新的信息理论框架，用于广义多视图学习。在其指导下，我们构建了一个具有三层渐进式结构的多视图编码方法，即In",
