    "translated_abstract": "特征选择可以定义为一个优化问题，并通过生物启发的算法来解决。蜜蜂算法在特征选择优化任务中表现出良好的性能。另一方面，局部相位量化是一种在深度图像上具有优秀性能的频域特征。在该研究中，通过从伊朗Kinect面部数据库（IKFDB）中提取RGB（彩色）和深度图像的局部相位量化特征，蜜蜂特征选择算法应用于选择最终分类任务所需的特征数量。IKFDB使用Kinect传感器V.2进行记录，包括面部和面部微表情识别的彩色和深度图像。在最终验证中，使用了五种面部表情：愤怒，喜悦，惊讶，厌恶和恐惧。提出的蜜蜂局部相位量化方法与粒子群优化、主成分分析、Lasso和仅局部相位量化特征在支持向量机和K最近邻分类任务中进行了比较。",
