    "abstract": "Living organisms need to acquire both cognitive maps for learning the structure of the world and planning mechanisms able to deal with the challenges of navigating ambiguous environments. Although significant progress has been made in each of these areas independently, the best way to integrate them is an open research question. In this paper, we propose the integration of a statistical model of cognitive map formation within an active inference agent that supports planning under uncertainty. Specifically, we examine the clone-structured cognitive graph (CSCG) model of cognitive map formation and compare a naive clone graph agent with an active inference-driven clone graph agent, in three spatial navigation scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that while both agents are effective in simple scenarios, the active inference agent is more effective when planning in challenging scenarios, in which sensory observations provide ambiguous information about location.",

    "translated_abstract": "生物需要同时获得认知地图来学习世界的结构和能够应对导航模糊环境挑战的规划机制。尽管在每个独立领域都取得了显著进展，但如何最好地将它们集成在一起仍然是一个未解决的研究问题。本文提出将一种统计模型的认知地图形成与支持不确定性规划的主动推理代理进行集成。具体而言，我们研究了克隆结构认知图(CSCG)模型的认知地图形成，并比较了一个简单的克隆图代理和一个以主动推理为驱动的克隆图代理在三个空间导航场景中的效果。我们的研究结果表明，虽然两种代理在简单场景中都有效，但主动推理代理在面对挑战性场景中的规划上更有效，其中感知观察提供有关位置的模糊信息。",
