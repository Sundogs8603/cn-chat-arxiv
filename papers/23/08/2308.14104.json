    "translated_abstract": "机器学习已被应用于帮助解决NP困难的组合优化问题。目前一种常见的方式是通过深度神经网络学习构建解决方案，由于其高效性和对专业知识要求较少，因此越来越受到关注。然而，许多用于车辆路径问题（VRPs）的神经构建方法都集中在具有指定节点分布和有限规模的合成问题实例上，导致在通常涉及复杂且未知节点分布以及大规模问题的现实世界问题上性能较差。为了使神经VRP求解器更实用，我们设计了一个从本地可迁移拓扑特征中学习的辅助策略，称为本地策略，并与典型的构建策略（从VRP实例的全局信息中学习）相结合形成一个集成策略。通过联合训练，聚合的策略相互协作和互补，以提升泛化性能。",
