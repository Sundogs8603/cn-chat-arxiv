    "abstract": "To satisfy the broad applications and insatiable hunger for deploying low latency multimedia data classification and data privacy in a cloud-based setting, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an important learning paradigm. For the practical cases involving limited computational power and only unlabeled data in many wireless communications applications, this work investigates FL paradigm in a resource-constrained and label-missing environment. Specifically, we propose a novel framework of UFed-GAN: Unsupervised Federated Generative Adversarial Network, which can capture user-side data distribution without local classification training. We also analyze the convergence and privacy of the proposed UFed-GAN. Our experimental results demonstrate the strong potential of UFed-GAN in addressing limited computational resources and unlabeled data while preserving privacy.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了满足广泛的应用需求和对在基于云的环境中部署低延迟多媒体数据分类和数据隐私的需求，联邦学习（FL）已成为重要的学习范式。针对许多无线通信应用中的限制计算能力和仅有无标签数据的实际案例，本文研究了资源受限和标签缺失环境中的联邦学习范式。具体而言，我们提出了一种新的UFed-GAN框架：无监督的联邦生成对抗网络，可以捕捉用户端数据分布而无需进行本地分类训练。同时，我们还分析了所提出的UFed-GAN的收敛性和隐私性。我们的实验结果表明，UFed-GAN在处理限制的计算资源和无标签数据的同时保护隐私方面具有很大的潜力。",
