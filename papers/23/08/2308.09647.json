    "translated_abstract": "在安全关键应用中部署深度学习模型仍然是一项非常具有挑战性的任务，需要对这些模型的可靠运行提供保证。不确定性量化（UQ）方法估计每个预测的模型置信度，通过考虑随机性和模型错误规范化的影响来指导决策。尽管最先进的UQ方法取得了一些进展，但它们在计算上要么非常昂贵，要么产生保守的预测集/区间。我们引入了一种新的混合UQ方法MC-CP，它将一种新的自适应蒙特卡洛（MC）dropout方法与合规预测（CP）相结合。MC-CP在运行时自适应调节传统的MC dropout以节省内存和计算资源，使得预测可以被CP使用，得到鲁棒的预测集/区间。通过全面的实验，我们展示了MC-CP相比MC dropout、RAPS和CQR等先进的UQ方法能够显著改善分类性能",
