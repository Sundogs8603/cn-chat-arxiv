    "translated_abstract": "审计轨迹是任何日志中记录活动执行者的证据性指标。现代反应式系统（如事务处理系统、管理信息系统、决策支持系统甚至高级管理系统）在执行日常任务时记录用户的活动，其中一个最重要的原因可能是安全性。为了有效监控和管理隐私和信息访问，这些日志中捕获和记录的轨迹在这方面起着至关重要的作用。然而，在开源领域，情况并非如此。尽管自由软件的目标是允许访问、免费分发和修改代码的权利，但拥有此类审计轨迹可以帮助追踪和了解这些社区的活跃成员以及他们执行的活动类型。在本文中，我们提出使用过程挖掘来构建日志，尽可能利用在开源存储库中找到的数据，以产生一个过程挖掘模型。",
