    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）展示了在没有特定微调的情况下，即可根据自然语言意图生成准确的代码片段的印象能力。尽管先前的研究已经突出了微调LLMs的优势，但这个过程代价高，对于拥有数十亿个参数的模型来说，在资源稀缺的环境下是不切实际的。为了解决这些挑战，以前的研究探索了在上下文学习（ICL）作为一种策略，用任务特定的提示示例指导LLM生成过程。然而，ICL引入了一些不便之处，比如需要设计上下文相关的提示和没有学习任务特定的参数，从而限制了下游任务的性能。在这种情况下，我们预见参数高效微调（PEFT）技术作为一种有前途的方法，可以在保持合理资源消耗的同时，高效地将LLM专门用于任务特定的数据。",
