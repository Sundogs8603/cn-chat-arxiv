    "translated_abstract": "现有的属性值提取（AVE）模型需要大量的标记数据进行训练。然而，现实世界中的电子商务每天都会有带有新属性值对的新产品进入市场。因此，我们在多标签少样本学习（FSL）中制定AVE，旨在基于少量的训练示例提取未见过的属性值对。我们提出了一种基于原型网络的知识增强注意力框架（KEAF），利用生成的标签描述和类别信息来学习更具有区分性的原型。此外，KEAF通过计算与标签相关的权重和查询相关的权重，整合了混合注意力，以减少噪声并捕捉更多信息丰富的语义。为了实现多标签推理，KEAF进一步通过整合支持集和查询集的语义信息来学习动态阈值。在两个数据集上进行的大量实验和消融研究表明，KEAF的性能优于其他方法。",
