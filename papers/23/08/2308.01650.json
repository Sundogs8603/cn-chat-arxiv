    "translated_abstract": "图和超图表示学习受到各个研究领域的广泛关注。尽管图神经网络（GNNs）、超图神经网络（HGNNs）及其精心设计的变种在一些常用基准图和超图上有不错的性能和丰富的应用，但它们在某些情况下却不如简单的多层感知器（Multi-Layer Perceptron）表现好。这一观察促使人们重新审视当前GNNs和HGNNs的设计范式，并提出了有效提取图特征的挑战。本文设计了一种用于图和超图表示学习的通用特征编码器，称为UniG-Encoder。该架构从连接节点的拓扑关系的前向转换开始，通过一个归一化投影矩阵将其转换为边或超边特征。得到的边/超边特征以及原始节点特征一起输入神经网络。编码后的节点嵌入然后被生成。",
