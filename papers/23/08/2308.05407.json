    "abstract": "With a rapidly increasing amount and diversity of remote sensing (RS) data sources, there is a strong need for multi-view learning modeling. This is a complex task when considering the differences in resolution, magnitude, and noise of RS data. The typical approach for merging multiple RS sources has been input-level fusion, but other - more advanced - fusion strategies may outperform this traditional approach. This work assesses different fusion strategies for crop classification in the CropHarvest dataset. The fusion methods proposed in this work outperform models based on individual views and previous fusion methods. We do not find one single fusion method that consistently outperforms all other approaches.

    "translated_abstract": "随着遥感数据源数量和多样性的快速增加，多视角学习建模越来越重要。然而，由于遥感数据的分辨率、幅度和噪声差异，这是一个复杂的任务。通常的方法是在输入级别进行融合，但其他更高级的融合策略可能会超越传统方法。本研究评估了在CropHarvest数据集中用于农作物分类的不同融合策略。本文提出的融合方法优于基于单个视角和先前的融合方法的模型。我们没有找到一个单一的融合方法一直优于其他方法。相反，我们对三个不同数据集的多视角融合方法进行了比较，并表明，在测试区域不同的方法获得最佳性能。尽管如此，我们提出了一个初步的选择融合方法的标准。",
