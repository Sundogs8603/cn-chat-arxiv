    "translated_abstract": "血管在医学成像中的分割是血管疾病诊断和介入治疗规划中的重要步骤之一，涉及图像医学和介入医学的广泛应用场景。然而，由于细微的分支和复杂的结构，血管掩膜的手工注释是具有挑战性和资源密集型的。为了克服这个问题，本文提出了一种自监督血管分割方法，称为对比扩散对抗表示学习（C-DARL）模型。我们的模型包括一个扩散模块和一个生成模块，通过从扩散潜变量生成合成血管图像来学习多领域血管数据的分布。此外，我们采用基于掩膜的对比损失进行对比学习，使模型可以学习更加真实的血管表示。为了验证C-DARL的有效性，我们使用多种血管数据集进行训练，包括冠状动脉造影图像、腹部数字化图像等。",
