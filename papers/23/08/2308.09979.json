The aim of the study is to gain a better understanding of people's views and perceptions within the European context, which is already marked by important policy actions and regulatory processes. To survey the perceptions of the citizens of Europe we design and validate a new questionnaire (PAICE) structured around three dimensions: people's awareness, attitude, and trust. We observe that while awareness is characterized by a low level of self-assessed competency, the attitude toward AI is very positive for more than half of the population.

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一项广泛研究的结果，调查了来自八个不同国家（法国、德国、意大利、荷兰、波兰、罗马尼亚、西班牙和瑞典）的4,006名欧洲公民对人工智能的观点。研究旨在更好地了解欧洲上下文中人们的观点和认知，这已经受到重要政策行动和监管过程的影响。为了调查欧洲公民的观念，我们设计和验证了一个新的问卷（PAICE），围绕人们的意识、态度和信任三个维度进行构建。我们观察到，尽管意识水平自我评估较低，但对人工智能的态度在半数以上的人口中非常积极。通过对收集到的结果进行反思，我们强调了隐含的矛盾点，并确定了可能影响信任生态系统的建立和包容性人工智能发展的趋势。",
