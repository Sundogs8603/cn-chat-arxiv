    "abstract": "Extensive bedside monitoring in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) has resulted in complex temporal data regarding patient physiology, which presents an upscale context for clinical data analysis. In the other hand, identifying the time-series patterns within these data may provide a high aptitude to predict clinical events. Hence, we investigate, during this work, the implementation of an automatic data-driven system, which analyzes large amounts of multivariate temporal data derived from Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and extracts high-level information so as to predict in-hospital mortality and Length of Stay (LOS) early. Practically, we investigate the applicability of LSTM network by reducing the time-frame to 6-hour so as to enhance clinical tasks. The experimental results highlight the efficiency of LSTM model with rigorous multivariate time-series measurements for building real-world prediction engines.",

    "translated_abstract": "在重症监护病房 (ICU) 进行的大量床边监测产生了与患者生理相关的复杂时间数据，这为临床数据分析提供了一个复杂的背景。另一方面，识别出这些数据中的时间序列模式可能会提供高度能力来预测临床事件。因此，在这项工作中，我们研究了实施一个自动数据驱动的系统，该系统分析来自电子健康记录 (EHRs) 的大量多变量时间数据，并提取高级信息以早期预测住院死亡率和住院时间。在实践中，我们通过将时间窗口缩短到6小时来研究LSTM网络的适用性，以增强临床任务。实验结果突出了LSTM模型的效率，通过严格的多变量时间序列测量来构建真实世界的预测引擎。",
