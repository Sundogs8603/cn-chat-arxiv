    "translated_abstract": "高通量实验技术和机器学习的结合最近开启了加速材料发现的新时代，使得能够识别具有尖端性能的材料成为可能。然而，某些物理量的测量仍然具有挑战性。具体而言，要实现掺杂聚合物材料中的最佳电导率，需要谨慎的工艺控制、实验和繁琐的测量。我们提出了一种机器学习方法，依赖于易于测量的吸收光谱，加速了测量电导率的工作流程。第一个机器学习模型（分类模型）能够准确地分类电导率大于~25至100 S/cm的样品，达到100%的准确率。对于具有高导电性的子集样品，我们使用了第二个机器学习模型（回归模型）来预测它们的电导率，得到了令人印象深刻的测试R2值为0.984。为了验证这种方法，我们进行了实验来比较在电导率优化方面使用机器学习方法的效果。",
