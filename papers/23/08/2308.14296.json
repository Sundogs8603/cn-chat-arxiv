    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统（RS）通过深度学习取得了显著进展，但当前RS方法通常在特定任务数据集上训练和微调模型，限制了它们对新推荐任务的泛化能力以及利用外部知识的能力，因为模型规模和数据大小的限制。因此，我们设计了一种LLM驱动的自主推荐代理RecMind，能够利用外部知识，利用谨慎规划的工具为零-shot个性化推荐提供支持。我们提出了一种Self-Inspiring算法来提高规划能力。在每个中间步骤，LLM自我激励以考虑所有先前探索过的状态来规划下一步。这一机制极大地提高了模型理解和利用历史信息规划推荐的能力。我们评估了RecMind在各种推荐场景中的性能。",
