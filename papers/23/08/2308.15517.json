    "translated_abstract": "Document AI旨在通过利用自然语言处理和计算机视觉技术自动分析文档。其中一个主要任务是文档布局分析，通过解释布局、图像和文本的内容和空间关系来结构化文档页面。这个任务可以是以图像为中心，目的是识别和标记各种区域，如作者和段落；也可以是以文本为中心，重点是对文档中的单词进行分类。虽然有越来越复杂的方法来改进布局分析，但对于这些方法的普适性仍存在疑虑。具体而言，先前的研究基于非常不同的架构开发了系统，如基于Transformer的、基于图的和卷积神经网络。然而，没有研究提及这些模型在比较分析中的有效性。此外，虽然存在能进行知识转移的语言无关的Document AI模型，但其性能仍有限制。",

    "en_tdlr": "This comparative study explores the effectiveness of transformer-based, graph-based models, and convolutional neural networks in document layout analysis. It reveals their strengths and weaknesses, filling the gap in prior research that lacked comparative analysis of these models. Additionally, despite the existence of language-independent Document AI models, their performance is still limited."
