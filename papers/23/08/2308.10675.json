    "abstract": "We propose a new best-of-both-worlds algorithm for bandits with variably delayed feedback. The algorithm improves on prior work by Masoudian et al. [2022] by eliminating the need in prior knowledge of the maximal delay $d_{\\mathrm{max}}$ and providing tighter regret bounds in both regimes. The algorithm and its regret bounds are based on counts of outstanding observations (a quantity that is observed at action time) rather than delays or the maximal delay (quantities that are only observed when feedback arrives). One major contribution is a novel control of distribution drift, which is based on biased loss estimators and skipping of observations with excessively large delays. Another major contribution is demonstrating that the complexity of best-of-both-worlds bandits with delayed feedback is characterized by the cumulative count of outstanding observations after skipping of observations with excessively large delays, rather than the delays or the maximal delay.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种用于具有可变延迟反馈的强化适应性算法的新方法。该算法通过消除对最大延迟$d_{\\mathrm{max}}$的先验知识的需求，并在两个情景下提供更紧密的遗憾界限，改进了Masoudian等人[2022]的先前工作。算法和它的遗憾界限是基于未解决的观测次数（在行动时间观察到的数量）而不是延迟或最大延迟（只有当反馈到达时才能观察到的数量）。一个主要的贡献是基于有偏损失估计器和跳过具有过大延迟观测的新型分布漂移控制。另一个主要的贡献是证明了具有延迟反馈的强化适应性算法的复杂性是由在跳过具有过大延迟观测后的累积未解决观测次数来描述的，而不是延迟或最大延迟。",
