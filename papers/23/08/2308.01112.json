    "translated_abstract": "在这项研究中，我们关注订单拆分行为。订单拆分是一种交易策略，将大型潜在元订单拆分为小块，以降低交易成本。这种策略性行为被认为很重要，因为它是长程相关性（LRC）在持续订单流中微观起源的有前景的候选者。实际上，在2005年，Lillo、Mike和Farmer (LMF) 提出了一个订单拆分交易者的微观模型，以从微观动力学量化预测LRC的渐近行为。这个场景的合理性已经由Toth等人在2015年进行了定性研究。然而，在缺乏大型微观数据集的情况下，尚未提出关于LMF模型定量预测的实质支持。在本报告中，我们首次提供了每个交易账户级别上订单拆分行为的定量统计分析。我们分析了大量的东京股市数据集。",
