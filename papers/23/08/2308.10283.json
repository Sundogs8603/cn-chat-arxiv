    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的参数自适应的不确定性惩罚贝叶斯信息准则（UBIC），以优先考虑对噪音空时观测数据进行充分约束的简约偏微分方程（PDE）。由于直接使用BIC进行模型选择已知会导致不理想的过度拟合PDE，UBIC在概率视图中通过模型支持的变异系数来量化不确定性，并对找到的PDE进行惩罚。我们还引入了基于物理的神经网络学习作为一种基于模拟的方法，以进一步灵活地验证所选定的PDE与其他发现的PDE。数值结果证实了UBIC在识别真实的主导PDE上的成功应用。此外，我们揭示了去噪观测数据对改善BIC得分和模型复杂度之间的权衡有一个有趣的效果。",
