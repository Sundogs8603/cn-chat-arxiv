    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在解决稠密标签问题，在不牺牲太多准确性的情况下修剪数据集的重要部分。我们观察到，在标准的医学图像分割基准上，应用于图像分类的个别训练样本的损失梯度范数度量无法识别出重要样本。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种数据修剪方法，通过使用动态平均Dice分数来考虑目标区域上的训练动态。据我们所知，我们是在医学图像分析领域中首次考虑密集标签任务中数据重要性的研究者，做出以下贡献：(1)通过严格的实证分析研究潜在的原因，(2)确定了在密集标签问题中有效的数据修剪方法。我们的解决方案可以作为选择医学图像分割中重要样本的强大而简单的基准，结合数据来源进行使用。",
