Recently, Transformer -based methods have attracted numerous researchers in this domain and achieved state-of-the-art results in most of the pair languages. In this paper, we report an effective method using a phrase mechanism, PhraseTransformer, to improve the strong baseline model Transformer in constructing a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system for parallel corpora Vietnamese-Chinese. Our experiments on the MT dataset of the VLSP 2022 competition achieved the BLEU score of 35.3 on Vietnamese to Chinese and 33.2 BLEU scores on Chinese to Vietnamese data.
