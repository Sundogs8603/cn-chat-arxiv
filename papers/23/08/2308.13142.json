Following the success of ChatGPT, numerous language models have been introduced, demonstrating remarkable performance. Similar advancements have also been observed in image generation models, such as Google's Imagen model, OpenAI's DALL-E 2, and stable diffusion models, which have exhibited impressive capabilities in generating images. However, similar to large language models, these models still encounter unresolved challenges. Fortunately, the availability of open-source stable diffusion models and their underlying mathematical principles has enabled the academic community to extensively analyze the performance of current image generation models and make improvements based on this stable diffusion framework.
