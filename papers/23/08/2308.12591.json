    "translated_abstract": "均衡是数字无线通信系统接收端的一项重要任务，传统上使用基于模型的估计方法来进行。在众多选项中，迭代软干扰抵消（SIC）是一种表现良好的方法，因为它避免了迭代估计过程中由硬决策数据符号估计引起的错误传播。然而，基于模型的方法存在高计算复杂度和性能降低的问题，因为需要进行逼近。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于神经网络（NN）的均衡方法，称为SICNN，通过对基于模型的迭代SIC方法进行深度展开来设计，消除了其基于模型的对应方法的主要缺点。我们提出了不同版本的SICNN。SICNNv1非常类似于基于模型的方法，专门为单载波频域均衡系统设计",
