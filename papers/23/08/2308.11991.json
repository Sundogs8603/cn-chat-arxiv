    "abstract": "The design of interpretable deep learning models working in relational domains poses an open challenge: interpretable deep learning methods, such as Concept-Based Models (CBMs), are not designed to solve relational problems, while relational models are not as interpretable as CBMs. To address this problem, we propose Relational Concept-Based Models, a family of relational deep learning methods providing interpretable task predictions. Our experiments, ranging from image classification to link prediction in knowledge graphs, show that relational CBMs (i) match generalization performance of existing relational black-boxes (as opposed to non-relational CBMs), (ii) support the generation of quantified concept-based explanations, (iii) effectively respond to test-time interventions, and (iv) withstand demanding settings including out-of-distribution scenarios, limited training data regimes, and scarce concept supervisions.",

    "translated_abstract": "在关系领域中设计可解释的深度学习模型是一个开放性挑战：可解释的深度学习方法，如基于概念的模型（CBMs），并没有设计来解决关系问题，而关系模型也没有像CBMs那样可解释。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了关系概念模型，这是一种提供可解释任务预测的关系深度学习方法家族。我们的实验从图像分类到知识图谱中的链接预测，表明关系CBMs：（i）与现有的关系黑盒的泛化性能相匹配（不同于非关系的CBMs），（ii）支持生成量化的基于概念的解释，（iii）有效应对测试时的干预，以及（iv）经受住包括超出分布情景、有限的训练数据范围和稀缺的概念监督等苛刻条件。",
