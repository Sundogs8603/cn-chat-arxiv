We submit the same system on Track 1 and Track 2, which is trained with only VoxCeleb2-dev. Large-scale ResNet and RepVGG architectures are developed for the challenge. We propose a consistency-aware score calibration method, which leverages the stability of audio voiceprints in similarity score by a Consistency Measure Factor (CMF). CMF brings a huge performance boost in this challenge. Our final system is a fusion of six models and achieves the first place in Track 1 and second place in Track 2 of VoxSRC 2023. The minDCF of our submission is 0.0855 and the EER is 1.5880%.",
