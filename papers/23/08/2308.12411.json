    "translated_title": "智能的一种理论：概念、模型和意义",
    "translated_abstract": "智能是人类用来表示实现目标能力的概念。给予这个广泛的范畴，智能已经被无数次定义，以各种方式进行研究，并使用多种测量方法进行量化。理解智能最终需要理论和量化，但这两者都很难捉摸。我的主要目标是确定智能的一些核心要素，讨论其中的一些挑战，并提出一种基于第一原理的理论。我主要关注以人类为定义和参照对象的智能，常常与机器进行比较，意图为生命、集合体、人工智能等非设计的物理和化学系统提供更一般化的描述。我讨论了智能的关键特征，包括路径效率和目标准确性、智能作为黑盒、环境影响、处理意外情况的灵活性、智能的回归和相对论性质。",
