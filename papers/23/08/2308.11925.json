The approach is based on a coupled system derived from the first-order optimality system of the optimal control problem, and applies physics informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve the coupled system. We present an error analysis of the numerical scheme, and provide $L^2(\\Omega)$ error bounds on the state, control and adjoint state in terms of deep neural network parameters (e.g., depth, width, and parameter bounds) and the number of sampling points in the domain and on the boundary. The main tools in the analysis include offset Rademacher complexity and boundedness and Lipschitz continuity of neural network functions. We present several numerical examples to illustrate the approach and compare it with three existing approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们提出并分析了一个用于线性和半线性二阶椭圆问题的最优控制问题（有/无盒约束）的数值求解器。该方法基于从最优控制问题的一阶最优性系统推导出的耦合系统，利用物理信息神经网络（PINNs）来解决耦合系统。我们对数值方案进行误差分析，并针对深度神经网络参数（如深度、宽度和参数范围）以及域内和边界上的采样点数，给出了关于状态、控制和伴随状态的$L^2(\\Omega)$误差界。分析中的主要工具包括偏移Rademacher复杂度以及神经网络函数的有界性和Lipschitz连续性。我们提供了几个数值示例来说明该方法，并与三种现有方法进行比较。",
