In this paper, we present PaniniQA, a patient-centric interactive question answering system designed to help patients understand their discharge instructions. PaniniQA first identifies important clinical content from patients' discharge instructions and then formulates patient-specific educational questions. In addition, PaniniQA is also equipped with answer verification functionality to provide timely feedback to correct patients' misunderstandings.

    "translated_abstract": "患者门户允许出院患者在电子健康记录中访问他们的个性化出院指导。然而，许多患者很难理解或记住他们的出院指导。在本论文中，我们提出了PaniniQA，一个以患者为中心的交互式问答系统，旨在帮助患者理解他们的出院指导。PaniniQA首先从患者的出院指导中识别重要的临床内容，然后提出患者特定的教育问题。此外，PaniniQA还配备了答案验证功能，可以及时反馈来纠正患者的误解。我们的全面自动和人工评估结果表明，PaniniQA能够通过有效的互动提高患者对医疗指导的掌握程度。",
