    "abstract": "We present some initial results of a large-scale Italian project called PRODIGIT which aims to support tax judges and lawyers through digital technology, focusing on AI. We have focused on generation of summaries of judicial decisions and on the extraction of related information, such as the identification of legal issues and decision-making criteria, and the specification of keywords. To this end, we have deployed and evaluated different tools and approaches to extractive and abstractive summarisation. We have applied LLMs, and particularly on GPT4, which has enabled us to obtain results that proved satisfactory, according to an evaluation by expert tax judges and lawyers. On this basis, a prototype application is being built which will be made publicly available.",
