    "translated_abstract": "交通预测对于智能交通系统（ITS）和智能城市的发展至关重要。虽然空间-时间图神经网络（STGNN）通过融合循环神经网络（RNN）或Transformer与图神经网络（GNN）展示了在这个领域的潜力，但面临着计算复杂性、梯度问题和资源密集性的挑战。本文通过提出节点嵌入方法、时间序列分解和周期性学习来应对这些挑战。我们引入了STLinear，这是一种旨在优化效率和性能的极简模型结构。与传统的STGNN不同，STLinear完全在本地运行，避免了节点间的数据交换，仅依赖线性层，从而大大降低了计算需求。我们在真实数据集上的实证研究证实了STLinear的卓越性能，达到或超过了领先的STGNN的准确度，但计算需求显著减少。",
