Using this technique we obtain new lower bounds for monotonicity testing over discrete cubes and tight lower bounds for log-concavity testing.

    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一种用于证明分布测试下界的新技术，该技术适用于涉及分布中二项概率的不等式定义的性质。利用这种技术，我们得到了关于离散立方体上的单调性测试的新下界以及关于对数凹性测试的紧密下界。我们的基本技术涉及通过调整一对二项概率的概率来构造一对矩匹配的分布族，使得一个族保持定义的不等式，而另一个族违背它们。",
