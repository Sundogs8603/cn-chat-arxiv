    "translated_abstract": "在金融欺诈检测领域，理解潜在的模式和动态对于确保有效和可靠的系统至关重要。本研究引入了一种新技术“TimeTrail”，采用先进的时间相关性分析来解释复杂的金融欺诈模式。该技术利用与时间有关的见解，为欺诈检测决策提供透明和可解释的解释，增强问责和信任。 \"TimeTrail\"方法包括三个关键阶段：时间数据丰富、动态相关性分析和可解释的模式可视化。首先，原始的金融交易数据通过添加时间属性进行丰富。然后，使用创新的统计方法量化这些属性之间的动态相关性。最后，一个统一的可视化框架以可解释的方式呈现这些相关性。为了验证“TimeTrail”的有效性，对多样化的金融数据进行了一项研究。",
