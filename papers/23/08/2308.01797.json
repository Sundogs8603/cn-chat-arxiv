    "translated_abstract": "作业调度是一个众所周知的组合优化问题，具有无尽的应用。良好规划的调度在自动化系统中带来许多好处：它们限制生产成本和浪费。然而，这个问题的NP难度使得使用启发式算法至关重要，其设计困难，需要专门的知识，并且通常会产生针对特定任务的方法。本文提出了一种原始的端到端深度强化学习方法来进行调度，自动学习调度规则。我们的技术受到自然语言编码器-解码器模型在序列处理中的启发，并据我们所知，从未用于调度目的。我们将我们的方法应用和测试到作业车间问题的一些基准实例上，但该技术足够通用，可以有可能用于处理其他不同的最优作业调度任务，减少干预。结果证明...",
