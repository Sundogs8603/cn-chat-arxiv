    "translated_abstract": "随着数学规划的进步，我们现在有能力有效地解决几十年前被认为无法解决的大规模实际问题。然而，由于优化软件被视为黑盒子，一些可证明的最优解可能不被接受。虽然科学家们对此很了解，但对于实践者来说却很难理解。因此，我们主张将解释性作为另一个评估标准引入解决方案，既包括目标值，也包括可解释性，这使得我们能够在这两个标准之间找到权衡解。通过将解决方案与过去类似情况下实施的（不一定是最优的）解进行比较，我们达到了可解释性。因此，更喜欢展现相似特征的解决方案。尽管我们证明了即使在简单情况下可解释模型也是NP-hard，但我们确定了相关的多项式可解情况，如可解释的最短路径问题。在ar的数值实验上也验证了我们的结果。",
