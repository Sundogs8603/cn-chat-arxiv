While a variety of health data streams has been made available by such devices to users, these streams are often presented as separate time-series visualizations, in which the potential relationships between health variables are not explicitly made visible.

    "translated_abstract": "许多国家的消费者健康设备（如智能手表、睡眠监测器、智能称等）的普及不仅引起了对健康监测的兴趣的增长，还引发了大量支持普通公众探索此类数据的“智能”应用程序的开发，有时还与专业健康服务进行整合。尽管这些设备向用户提供了各种健康数据流，但这些数据流通常以独立的时间序列可视化形式呈现，其中健康变量之间的潜在关系并未明确可见。此外，尽管工作和社交连接等生活的其他方面越来越数字化，但健康和福祉应用程序很少利用广泛使用的个人信息管理工具（如共享日历和电子邮件系统）提供的潜在有用的上下文信息。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了如何将健康应用数据和个人信息管理工具进行关联，解决了健康数据可视化中的变量关系问题，并提出了利用个人信息管理工具的上下文信息来增强健康和福祉应用程序的方法。"
