    "translated_abstract": "由于其复杂的波形、持久的持续时间和低信噪比，极端质量比激发(EMRI)的检测是复杂的，这使得它们与紧凑的二进制融合相比更难被识别。虽然基于匹配滤波的技术以其计算要求而闻名，但现有的基于深度学习的方法主要处理时域数据，并且通常受到数据持续时间和信噪比的限制。此外，大多数现有工作忽略了时间延迟干涉仪(TDI)并在探测器响应计算中应用了长波近似，从而限制了其处理激光频率噪声的能力。在这项研究中，我们介绍了DECODE，这是一个以频域序列建模为重点的端到端模型，用于EMRI信号检测。DECODE围绕着一个以扩张因果卷积神经网络为中心，使用考虑到TDI-1.5探测器响应的合成数据进行训练，可以高效地处理一年的多通道TDI数据。",
