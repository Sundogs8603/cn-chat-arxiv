    "translated_abstract": "在有限时间内找到高质量的组合优化问题的可行解是具有挑战性的，因为其具有离散的特性。最近，越来越多的机器学习方法被用来解决组合优化问题。神经网络下潜 (Neural diving，ND) 是一种学习方法，用于生成混合整数规划问题中的部分离散变量赋值。然而，ND的一个主要缺点是机器学习和混合整数规划目标之间存在较大差异，即变量值分类准确度与原始解的界的差异。我们的研究发现，特定范围的变量分配率（覆盖率）会产生高质量的可行解，我们建议优化覆盖率来弥补学习和混合整数规划目标之间的差距。因此，我们提出了一种事后方法和一种基于学习的方法来优化覆盖率。我们方法的一个关键思想是共同学习限制覆盖率搜索空间。",
