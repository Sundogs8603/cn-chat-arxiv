We formulate an inverse learning problem in a Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower, where each player's action is the trajectory of a dynamical system. We propose an active inverse learning method for the leader to infer which hypothesis among a finite set of candidates describes the follower's objective function. Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, the proposed method actively maximizes the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses to accelerate the leader's inference. We demonstrate the proposed method in a receding-horizon repeated trajectory game. Compared with uniformly random inputs, the leader inputs provided by the proposed method accelerate the convergence of the probability of different hypotheses conditioned on the follower's trajectory by orders of magnitude.",

    "translated_abstract": "博弈论的逆向学习是从玩家的行为中推断出他们的目标的问题。我们在一个Stackelberg博弈中，通过每个玩家的动态系统轨迹来定义一个逆向学习问题，其中包括一个领导者和一个跟随者。我们提出了一种主动逆向学习方法，让领导者推断出一个有限候选集中描述跟随者目标函数的假设。与现有方法使用被动观察到的轨迹不同，所提出的方法主动地最大化不同假设下跟随者轨迹的差异，加速领导者的推断过程。我们在一个递进的重复轨迹博弈中展示了所提出的方法。与均匀随机输入相比，所提供的方法加速了概率收敛到条件于跟随者轨迹的不同假设上的收敛速度。",
