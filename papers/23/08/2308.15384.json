    "abstract": "This papers proposes a generic, high-level methodology for generating forecast combinations that would deliver the optimal linearly combined forecast in terms of the mean-squared forecast error if one had access to two population quantities: the mean vector and the covariance matrix of the vector of individual forecast errors. We point out that this problem is identical to a mean-variance portfolio construction problem, in which portfolio weights correspond to forecast combination weights. We allow negative forecast weights and interpret such weights as hedging over and under estimation risks across estimators. This interpretation follows directly as an implication of the portfolio analogy. We demonstrate our method's improved out-of-sample performance relative to standard methods in combining tree forecasts to form weighted random forests in 14 data sets.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个通用的、高层次的方法来生成预测组合，如果能够获得两个总体量：个体预测误差向量的均值向量和协方差矩阵，该方法能够以均方预测误差为标准，得到最优线性组合的预测。我们指出，这个问题与一个均值-方差投资组合构建问题是相同的，其中投资组合权重对应于预测组合权重。我们允许负的预测权重，并将这样的权重解释为对估计量之间的过度估计风险和不足估计风险进行对冲。这种解释直接来自投资组合类比。我们在14个数据集中演示了我们的方法相对于标准方法在组合树预测形成加权随机森林方面的外样本表现改进。",
