    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了将哲学、心理学与数学相结合的Philomatics和Psychomatics概念。我们解释了这种结合的四个动机，包括满足分析哲学的需求、提出哲学科学、用哲学来证明数学算法以及哲学和数学的抽象。我们列举了各种Philomatics和Psychomatics的示例，其中一些在更深入地解释。第一个示例是关于数学中注意机制与上下文原则、语义整体主义和使用理论的关系分析。另一个示例是关于哲学中柏拉图的形式理论与弦理论中的全息原理、面向对象编程和机器学习的关系。最后，我们解释了维特根斯坦的家族相似性与数学中的聚类的关系。本文为将哲学和心理学与数学相结合的研究打开了大门。",

The paper provides examples such as analyzing the relationship between the attention mechanism in mathematics and the context principle, semantic holism, and usage theory of meaning. It also explores the connections between Plato's theory of forms, the holographic principle, object-oriented programming, and machine learning. Additionally, it investigates the relationship between Wittgenstein's family resemblance and clustering in mathematics. This paper opens up avenues for further research in combining philosophy and psychology with mathematics."
