    "translated_abstract": "每当人类使用工具时，人类的表现会得到增强。认知系统是一种新型的工具，不断增强认知能力，现在可以执行高级认知任务，这些任务以前被认为只有人类能够完成。使用这种工具，也被称为认知(cog)，预计将会导致人类认知增强水平的进一步提高。在人类认知合奏中，人类和认知系统之间进行着合作、点对点和协作的对话，人类认知能力因此得到增强。因此，人类认知合奏能够实现比单独的人类或认知系统更多的工作。本文介绍了两项研究结果，旨在衡量认知的准确性——产生正确结果的能力，以及认知的精度——只产生正确结果的倾向。结果表明，信息的使用可以提高认知准确性和认知精度。",
