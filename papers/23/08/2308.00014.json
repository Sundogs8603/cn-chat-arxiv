This paper answers these two key questions using novel methods of text mining and network analysis. We examine technological interdependence across sectors over a period of half a century (from 1976 to 2021) by analyzing the text of 6.5 million patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and applying network analysis to uncover the full spectrum of linkages existing across technology areas. We demonstrate that patent text contains a wealth of information often not captured by traditional innovation metrics, such as patent citations. By using network analysis, we document that indirect linkages are as important as direct connections and that the former would remain mostly hidden using more traditional measures of indirect linkages, such as the Leontief inverse matrix. Finally, based on an impulse-response analysis, we illustrate ",

    "translated_abstract": "哪些技术联系影响了部门的创新能力？这些效应如何通过技术空间传递？本文使用新颖的文本挖掘和网络分析方法回答了这两个关键问题。我们通过分析美国专利商标局（USPTO）授予的650万项专利的文本，并应用网络分析方法，研究了半个世纪（从1976年到2021年）期间不同部门之间的技术相互依赖关系，揭示了存在于技术领域之间的全谱的联系。我们证明专利文本包含了往往无法通过传统的创新指标（例如专利引用）捕捉到的丰富信息。通过使用网络分析，我们记录了间接联系和直接联系同等重要，并且前者大部分使用传统的间接联系度量方法（如Leontief逆矩阵）往往会被隐藏。最后，基于冲击响应分析，我们进行了说明。",
