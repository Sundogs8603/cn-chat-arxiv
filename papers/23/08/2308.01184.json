    "translated_abstract": "对于带有噪声标签的学习问题，已经使用了判别模型和生成模型进行研究。尽管判别模型由于其简单的建模和更高效的计算训练过程而在该领域占主导地位，但生成模型能够更有效地分解干净和噪声标签，并改善标签转换矩阵的估计。然而，生成方法使用了复杂的公式来最大化噪声标签和数据的联合似然，这只间接优化了与数据和干净标签相关的感兴趣的模型。此外，这些方法依赖于很难训练的生成模型，并倾向于使用无信息的干净标签先验。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的生成噪声标签学习方法来解决这三个问题。首先，我们提出了一种新的模型优化方法，直接关联数据和干净标签。其次，通过使用判别的近似方法来隐式估计生成模型。",
