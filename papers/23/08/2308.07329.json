    "translated_abstract": "Blackjack或称为“21点”是一种流行的基于扑克牌的运气和技巧游戏。游戏的目标是在不超过21点的情况下，获得比庄家更高的手牌总数。理想的黑杰克策略将在长期内最大化财务回报，同时避免赌徒的破产。由于黑杰克的随机环境和固有的奖励结构，这为我们更好地理解强化学习代理在环境变化下的表现提供了一个吸引人的问题。在这里，我们考虑了一种用于最佳玩法的Q-learning解决方案，并研究了算法学习收敛速度与牌堆大小的关系。我们还实现了一个允许使用通用黑杰克规则的模拟器，以展示一个使用基本策略和HI-LO系统的牌数完美计数器如何使庄家破产，以及环境变化对这个结果的影响。我们的工作的创新之处在于将牌堆大小的影响概念性地理解为黑杰克中的因素。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates the variations in the performance of reinforcement learning agents in the game of Blackjack under different deck sizes. The research finds that the rate of learning convergence of the algorithm is affected by the deck size and demonstrates how a card counter using the basic strategy and HI-LO system can bankrupt the house. The novelty of this work lies in the recognition of deck size as a key factor impacting Blackjack performance."
