    "abstract": "At the beginning era of large language model, it is quite critical to generate a high-quality financial dataset to fine-tune a large language model for financial related tasks. Thus, this paper presents a carefully designed data creation pipeline for this purpose. Particularly, we initiate a dialogue between an AI investor and financial expert using ChatGPT and incorporate the feedback of human financial experts, leading to the refinement of the dataset. This pipeline yielded a robust instruction tuning dataset comprised of 103k multi-turn chats. Extensive experiments have been conducted on this dataset to evaluate the model's performance by adopting an external GPT-4 as the judge. The promising experimental results verify that our approach led to significant advancements in generating accurate, relevant, and financial-style responses from AI models, and thus providing a powerful tool for applications within the financial sector.",

    "translated_abstract": "在大型语言模型的初期阶段，为金融相关任务精调大型语言模型生成高质量的金融数据集非常关键。因此，本文提出了一个精心设计的数据创建流水线来实现这一目的。具体而言，我们使用ChatGPT引发了一个AI投资者和金融专家之间的对话，并融入了人工金融专家的反馈，从而改进了数据集。该流水线产生了一个由103k个多轮对话组成的稳定的指令精调数据集。通过采用外部的GPT-4作为评判者，在该数据集上进行了大量实验来评估模型的性能。有希望的实验结果验证了我们的方法在生成准确、相关和金融风格响应方面取得了显著进展，从而为金融领域的应用提供了一个强大的工具。",
