    "translated_abstract": "字符串数据在现实世界的数据集中很常见：从网络上采样的180万个真实Excel电子表格中，有67.6%的值表示为文本。成功清理这种字符串数据的系统对实际用户有重要影响。尽管以前的工作已经探索了字符串数据中的错误，但是所提出的方法通常局限于错误检测，或者需要用户提供注释、示例或约束来修复错误。此外，这些系统独立地关注于字符串中的句法错误或语义错误，而忽略了字符串通常同时包含句法和语义子字符串的情况。我们引入了DataVinci，一个完全无监督的字符串数据错误检测和修复系统。DataVinci学习基于正则表达式的模式，覆盖了列中大多数的值，并将不满足这些模式的值报告为数据错误。DataVinci可以根据主要模式和约束自动推导出对数据错误的修复。",
