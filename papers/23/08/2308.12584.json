    "translated_abstract": "处理完全未知数据对于任何部署的分类器都是一种挑战。分类模型通常是在一个静态预定义的数据集上进行训练，对于未分配的开放特征空间一无所知。因此，在推断过程中，它们很难处理超出分布范围的数据。解决这个任务的一种方法是在类别级别上进行开放式识别（OSR）。然而，大多数OSR方法本质上是有限的，因为它们训练的是封闭集分类器，并且只调整了对OSR的下游预测。本文提出了一个名为LORD的框架，通过利用未知数据来实现开放式识别。LORD在分类器训练过程中明确地建模开放空间，并对这种方法进行了系统评估。我们确定了三种模型无关的训练策略，利用了背景数据，并将其应用到已经建立的分类器上。由于LORD的广泛评估协议，我们始终能够展示对未知数据的改进识别能力。这些基准有助于...",
