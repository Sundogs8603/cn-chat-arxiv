    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界的约束条件下，学习战略性的机器人行为，如追逐-逃避交互，是非常具有挑战性的。它需要利用交互的动态性，并通过物理状态和潜在意图的不确定性进行规划。在本文中，我们将这个棘手的问题转化为一个监督学习问题，其中一个完全可观测的机器人策略为一个部分可观测的策略生成监督信号。我们发现，部分可观测的追逐者策略的监督信号质量取决于两个关键因素：逃避者行为的多样性和最优性的平衡，以及完全可观测策略中建模假设的强度。我们将我们的策略部署在一台具有RGB-D相机的四足机器人上，在野外的追逐-逃避交互中进行。尽管存在种种挑战，但感知约束带来了创造力：当机器人感觉不确定时，它被推动收集信息，从嘈杂的测量中预测目的意图。",

By transforming the problem into a supervised learning problem, a fully-observable robot policy is used to generate supervision for a partially-observable policy. Experimental results show that the quality of supervision for the partially-observable policy depends on the balance of diversity and optimality in the evader's behavior, as well as the strength of modeling assumptions in the fully-observable policy. The method is applied to a physical quadruped robot with an RGB-D camera, demonstrating its effectiveness and innovation."
