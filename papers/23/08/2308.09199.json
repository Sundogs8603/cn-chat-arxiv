    "translated_abstract": "研究表明，在具有多项式数量的挑战-响应对和多项式计算能力的情况下，即使在存在噪声的情况下，也可以以任意高的概率学习一类光学物理不可复制函数（PUFs），前提是噪声和挑战向量的分布符合温和的假设。这扩展了Rh\\\"uramir等人（2013）的结果，他们在没有噪声的情况下证明了该类PUFs的一个子集可以在多项式时间内学习，假设PUF的光学特性是线性的或具有可忽略的非线性效应。我们根据PUF的尺寸参数、挑战和噪声向量的分布以及回归算法的概率和准确性，导出了所需样本数量和线性回归算法的计算复杂度的多项式界限，这类似于Bootle等人（2018）的分析，他们证明了一种学习方法的可行性",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper examines the problem of learning noisy optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and establishes polynomial bounds to prove that it is possible to learn this class of functions with arbitrary precision and high probability given sufficient challenge-response pairs and computational power. This has significant implications for the field of physical security."
