    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）通常遭受知识截断或谬误问题，这意味着它们对未见事件不知情或生成具有不正确事实的文本，原因是数据过时/嘈杂。为此，出现了许多针对LLMs的知识编辑方法，旨在微妙地注入/编辑更新的知识或调整不良行为，同时将对不相关输入的影响最小化。然而，由于各种知识编辑方法之间存在显著差异，以及任务设置中的变化，社区中没有可用于知识编辑的标准实施框架，这妨碍了从业者将知识编辑应用于应用程序。为解决这些问题，我们提出了EasyEdit，一种易于使用的LLMs知识编辑框架。它支持各种尖端的知识编辑方法，并可以轻松应用于许多著名的LLMs，如T5、GPT-J、LlaMA等。从经验上来看，我们报告了kno",
