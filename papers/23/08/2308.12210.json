    "abstract": "Differentially Private Federated Learning (DP-FL) has garnered attention as a collaborative machine learning approach that ensures formal privacy.

    "translated_abstract": "差分隐私联邦学习（DP-FL）作为一种确保形式隐私的协同机器学习方法，已经引起了人们的关注。大多数DP-FL方法确保在每个边界内以记录级别的DP进行跨边界FL。然而，单个用户的数据可能延伸到多个边界，对于这种情况下的期望用户级DP保证仍然未知。在本研究中，我们提出了ULDP-FL，这是一个新颖的FL框架，旨在在单个用户的数据可能属于多个边界的跨边界FL中保证用户级DP。我们的算法通过每个用户的加权剪裁直接确保用户级DP，而不是采用组隐私方法。我们对算法的隐私和效用进行了理论分析。另外，我们通过使用密码学构件来增强算法的效用并展示了其私密实现。在真实数据集上的实证实验表明，我们的方法在隐私和效用的权衡方面取得了显著的改进。",
