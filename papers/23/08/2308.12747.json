    "abstract": "We propose a method to determine whether a given article was entirely written by a generative language model versus an alternative situation in which the article includes some significant edits by a different author, possibly a human. Our process involves many perplexity tests for the origin of individual sentences or other text atoms, combining these multiple tests using Higher Criticism (HC). As a by-product, the method identifies parts suspected to be edited. The method is motivated by the convergence of the log-perplexity to the cross-entropy rate and by a statistical model for edited text saying that sentences are mostly generated by the language model, except perhaps for a few sentences that might have originated via a different mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using real data and analyze the factors affecting its success. This analysis raises several interesting open challenges whose resolution may improve the method's effectiveness.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种方法，用于确定一篇给定文章是完全由生成性语言模型编写的，还是包含了一些由其他作者（可能是人类）进行了重要编辑的替代情况。我们的过程涉及对个别句子或其他文本单位起源进行的多个困惑度测试，将这些多个测试结合起来使用更高的批评力量（HC）。作为副产品，该方法还能够识别出可能被编辑的部分。该方法受到了对数困惑度收敛到交叉熵率的启发，以及一个统计模型来描述被编辑的文本，即句子主要由语言模型生成，但可能有少数句子是通过其他机制产生的。我们使用真实数据证明了我们方法的有效性，并分析了影响其成功的因素。这个分析提出了一些有趣的开放挑战，解决这些挑战可能会改善该方法的有效性。",
