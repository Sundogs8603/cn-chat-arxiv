    "abstract": "This work studies a challenging yet more realistic setting for zero-shot cross-task generalization: demonstration-free learning from textual instructions, presuming the existence of a paragraph-style task definition while no demonstrations exist. To better learn the task supervision from the definition, we propose two strategies: first, to automatically find out the critical sentences in the definition; second, a ranking objective to force the model to generate the gold outputs with higher probabilities when those critical parts are highlighted in the definition. The joint efforts of the two strategies yield state-of-the-art performance on the challenging benchmark. Our code will be released in the final version of the paper.",
