    "translated_abstract": "因果概率图模型已被广泛应用，可以在不同领域建模因果关系。随着其在汽车系统安全和机器学习等新领域的应用越来越普遍，人们对于类似DevOps和MLOps的集成生命周期框架的需求不断增加。目前，缺乏一个适用于因果工程的组织参考流程。为了填补这个空白并促进广泛的工业应用，我们提出了CausalOps，这是一个面向因果模型开发和应用的全新生命周期框架。通过定义因果工程过程中产生的关键实体、依赖关系和中间产物，我们建立了一个一致的词汇表和工作流模型。本研究将因果模型的使用情境化为不同阶段和利益相关者，概述了创建和维护因果模型的整体视图。CausalOps旨在推动因果方法在实际应用中的采用。",
