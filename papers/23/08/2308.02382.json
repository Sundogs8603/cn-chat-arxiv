    "translated_abstract": "生存分析是医学中的一种基本工具，用于对人群中发生感兴趣事件的时间进行建模。然而，在现实世界的应用中，生存数据通常是不完整、被审查、分布式和保密的，特别是在隐私保密至关重要的医疗保健环境中。数据稀缺严重限制了生存模型在依赖大型数据池的分布式应用中的可扩展性。联合学习是一种有望通过在多个数据集上训练机器学习模型而不损害用户隐私的技术，因此特别适合解决生存数据和大规模生存应用的挑战。尽管联合学习在分类和回归领域取得了重大发展，但在生存分析领域仍有许多未探索的方向。在本研究中，我们提出了联合生存森林算法的扩展，称为FedSurF++。这种联合集成方法可以对大规模生存数据进行建模并处理分布式情况。",
