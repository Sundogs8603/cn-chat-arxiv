    "translated_abstract": "由于大型语言模型（LLM）的强大能力，基于LLM的智能体已经展现出解决特定领域任务和模仿人类行为的潜力。然而，由于其有限的领域专业知识以及缺乏有效的认知架构，这些智能体生成的内容仍然相对表面。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一个可配置的通用多智能体交互（CGMI）框架，旨在模拟真实世界场景中的人际交往。具体而言，我们提出了一种树状结构的方法论，用于智能体的个性分配、检测和维护。此外，我们设计了一个基于ACT*模型的技能库的认知架构，其中包含记忆、反思和规划模块。我们还整合了通用智能体来增强虚拟环境的真实感。利用CGMI框架，我们模拟了多个教师和学生之间的课堂互动。",
