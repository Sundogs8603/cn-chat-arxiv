    "translated_abstract": "在构建可靠、鲁棒的安全关键应用的人工智能系统中，深度神经模型的校准起着重要作用。最近的研究表明，具有高预测能力的现代神经网络的校准性较差，产生不可靠的模型预测。尽管深度学习模型在各种基准测试中取得了显著的性能，但对模型的校准性和可靠性的研究相对较少。理想的深度模型不仅应具有高预测性能，还应具有良好的校准性。最近提出了一些使用不同机制进行深度模型校准的方法。在本综述中，我们回顾了最新的校准方法，并解释了它们执行模型校准的原理。首先，我们从模型校准的定义开始，解释了模型校准不准确的根本原因。然后，我们介绍了可以衡量模型校准性的关键指标。接下来，我们总结了一些校准方法的方法和实践。",

It has been found that modern deep neural networks show excellent predictive capability but poor calibration, leading to unreliable model predictions. Therefore, new approaches are needed to improve model calibration."
