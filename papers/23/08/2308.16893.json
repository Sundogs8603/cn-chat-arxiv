    "translated_abstract": "接触是机器人操作的核心。有时候，我们希望使用接触（例如操纵和抓取），而有时候，接触是有害的（例如避免障碍物）。然而，传统的路径规划算法只关注于无碰撞路径，限制了它们在接触丰富任务中的适用性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了语言条件路径规划的领域，将接触感知性融入到路径规划问题中。作为该领域的第一步，我们提出了语言条件碰撞函数（LACO），这是一种新颖的方法，只使用单视图图像、语言提示和机器人配置来学习碰撞函数。LACO可以预测机器人和环境之间的碰撞，从而实现灵活、有条件的路径规划，无需手动对象标注、点云数据或真实物体模型。在仿真和实际环境中，我们证明LACO可以实现复杂而细致的路径规划。",
