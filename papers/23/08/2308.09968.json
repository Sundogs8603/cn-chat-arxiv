    "translated_abstract": "本研究调查了零售投资者通过社交媒体平台，尤其是Reddit，组织自己参与特定股票的增长趋势。先前的研究已经强调了Reddit活动与相关股票的波动之间的显著关联。本研究旨在扩展分析至Twitter，作为最有影响力的社交媒体平台之一。为了实现这一目标，我们收集了相关的推文，并分析其情感以探索Twitter活动、情感与股票波动之间的关联。结果显示，Twitter活动与股票波动之间存在显著关系，但推文情感与股票表现之间的联系较弱。总体上，与Reddit活动相比，Twitter活动和情感似乎在这些事件中发挥的作用较小。这些发现为社交媒体平台对股市动态的影响提供了新的理论见解，也可能在实践中辅助投资者和监管机构。",
