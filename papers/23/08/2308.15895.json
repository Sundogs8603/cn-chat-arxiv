    "abstract": "Semi-autonomous driving, as it is already available today and will eventually become even more accessible, implies the need for driver and automation system to reliably work together in order to ensure safe driving. A particular challenge in this endeavour are situations in which the vehicle's automation is no longer able to drive and is thus requesting the human to take over. In these situations the driver has to quickly build awareness for the traffic situation to be able to take over control and safely drive the car. Within this context we present a software and hardware framework to asses how aware the driver is about the situation and to provide human-centred assistance to help in building situation awareness. The framework is developed as a modular system within the Robot Operating System (ROS) with modules for sensing the environment and the driver state, modelling the driver's situation awareness, and for guiding the driver's attention using specialized Human Machine Interfaces",

    "translated_abstract": "半自动驾驶作为已经可用并且将来会更加普及的技术，需要驾驶员和自动化系统可靠地合作以确保安全驾驶。在这个努力中的一个特别挑战是当车辆自动化无法驾驶并要求人员接管时。在这些情况下，驾驶员必须快速认识到交通情况，才能接管并安全驾驶汽车。在这个背景下，我们提出了一个软件和硬件框架来评估驾驶员对情况的认知，并提供以人为中心的辅助，以帮助建立情境感知。该框架是在机器人操作系统(ROS)内以模块化系统的形式开发的，包括感知环境和驾驶员状态的模块，建模驾驶员情境感知的模块，以及使用专门的人机界面指导驾驶员注意力的模块。",
