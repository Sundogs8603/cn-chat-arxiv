    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new aspect for determining the rank of the unimportant filters for filter pruning on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In the human synaptic system, there are two important channels known as excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters that transmit a signal from a neuron to a cell. Adopting the neuroscientific perspective, we propose a synapse-inspired filter pruning method, namely Dynamic Score (D-Score). D-Score analyzes the independent importance of positive and negative weights in the filters and ranks the independent importance by assigning scores. Filters having low overall scores, and thus low impact on the accuracy of neural networks are pruned. The experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by reducing notable amounts of FLOPs and Params without significant Acc. Drop.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种确定卷积神经网络(CNNs)中不重要过滤器排名的新方面。在人类突触系统中，有两个重要的通道被称为兴奋性和抑制性神经递质，它们将信号从神经元传递到细胞。采用神经科学的视角，我们提出了一种受突触启发的过滤修剪方法，称为动态评分(D-Score)。D-Score分析滤波器中正负权重的独立重要性，并通过分配分数对独立重要性进行排名。修剪具有低总分和对神经网络准确性影响较低的滤波器。在CIFAR-10和ImageNet数据集上的实验结果表明，我们提出的方法能够显著减少FLOPs和Params的数量，并且对准确率几乎没有影响。",
