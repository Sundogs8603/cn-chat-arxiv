    "translated_abstract": "图聚类是图分析中的一个基本任务，在利用图神经网络（GNNs）方面的最新进展已经取得了令人印象深刻的成果。尽管现有的基于GNN的图聚类方法取得了成功，但它们往往忽视了图结构的质量，这是由于现实世界图的稀疏性和多样性所固有的，从而导致了次优的性能。图结构学习可以通过添加缺失的连接和删除错误的连接来优化输入图。然而，以往的图结构学习工作主要集中在有监督的设置上，并且由于缺乏真实标签，不能直接应用于我们的特定聚类任务。为了弥补这个差距，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，称为同类性增强结构学习图聚类（HoLe）。我们的动机源于观察到，微妙地增强图结构中的同类性程度可以显著提升GNNs的性能。",
