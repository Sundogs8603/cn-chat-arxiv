    "translated_abstract": "经典的最优传输理论是通过最小化两个给定分布之间的预期成本来建立的。我们提出了扭曲最优传输的框架，通过最小化扭曲的预期成本来实现。这个新的公式是基于决策理论、鲁棒优化和风险管理中的具体问题而提出的，与经典理论相比具有很多不同的特点。我们选择了简单的成本函数，并研究了不同的扭曲函数及其对最优传输计划的影响。我们证明了在实线上，当扭曲函数是凸函数且成本函数是次模函数和单调函数时，共单调耦合是扭曲最优传输问题的最优解。我们还提供了一些对偶性和唯一性结果。对于逆S形扭曲函数和线性成本，我们得到了所有边际分布的唯一最优耦合形式，这个形式的耦合具有有趣的“首先共单调，然后反单调”依赖关系。",

    "en_tdlr": "Distorted optimal transport is a new approach that solves specific problems by minimizing the distorted expected cost. It has distinct features compared to the classic theory and can be applied in decision theory, robust optimization, and risk management. Comonotonic coupling is the optimal solution under certain conditions. The method also has some duality and uniqueness results."
