    "translated_abstract": "平行数据集对于执行和评估任何多语言任务都至关重要。然而，在考虑的语言对中，如果一个语言是资源稀缺的语言，现有的自上而下的平行数据，例如语料库，在数量和质量方面都缺乏，这是由于人工注释的缺乏。因此，对于资源稀缺的语言来说，更可行的做法是先朝向自下而上的方向发展，开发精细的对应词典数据集。然后，可以将其用于中级任务，如受监督的多语言词嵌入对齐。这反过来又可以指导高级任务的进行，如用于机器翻译（MT）的句子或段落文本语料库的对齐。尽管比为资源稀缺的语言生成和对齐大规模语料库更容易，但由于来自更大的研究实体的冷淡，甚至这些精细的对应数据集对于某些资源稀缺的语言也是缺乏的。我们已经观察到，存在一个需求，即构建一个用于Sinhala-English平行词典数据集的开源工具。",
