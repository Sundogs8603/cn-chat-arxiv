    "translated_abstract": "在密集雾霾场景下，图像去雾面临着很大挑战，因为在雾霾图像中很少保留原始信息。尽管之前的方法取得了显著的进展，但在密集雾霾场景中仍然存在内容和颜色的信息损失。最近出现的去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）展示了强大的生成能力，显示出解决这个问题的潜力。然而，DDPM没有考虑到去雾任务的物理特性，限制了其信息补全能力。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于DDPM和物理感知的图像去雾框架DehazeDDPM，适用于复杂的雾霾场景。具体而言，DehazeDDPM分为两个阶段。前一阶段用大气散射模型（ASM）对去雾任务进行物理建模，将分布拉近清晰数据，并赋予DehazeDDPM具有雾霾感知能力。后一阶段利用DDPM的强大生成能力来补偿雾霾引起的信息损失。",
