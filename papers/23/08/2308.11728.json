    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation involves automatically recommending the next item to users based on their historical item sequence. While most prior research employs RNN or transformer methods to glean information from the item sequence-generating probabilities for each user-item pair and recommending the top items, these approaches often overlook the challenge posed by spurious relationships. This paper specifically addresses these spurious relations. We introduce a novel sequential recommendation framework named Irl4Rec. This framework harnesses invariant learning and employs a new objective that factors in the relationship between spurious variables and adjustment variables during model training. This approach aids in identifying spurious relations. Comparative analyses reveal that our framework outperforms three typical methods, underscoring the effectiveness of our model. Moreover, an ablation study further demonstrates the critical role our model plays in detecting spurious relations.",

    "translated_abstract": "序列推荐涉及根据用户的历史物品序列自动推荐下一个物品。虽然大多数先前的研究采用RNN或transformer方法从物品序列中获取信息，为每个用户-物品对生成概率，并推荐前几个物品，但这些方法通常忽视了虚假关系带来的挑战。本文特别解决了这些虚假关系问题。我们介绍了一个新颖的序列推荐框架称为Irl4Rec。该框架利用不变表示学习，并在模型训练过程中考虑了虚假变量和调整变量之间的关系，有助于识别虚假关系。比较分析表明，我们的框架优于三种典型方法，凸显了我们模型的有效性。此外，消融研究进一步证明了我们的模型在检测虚假关系中的关键作用。",
