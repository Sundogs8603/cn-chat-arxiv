    "translated_abstract": "尽管ROUGE指标在评估提取性摘要任务中非常流行，但长期以来被批评缺乏语义意识，并对摘要生成器的排名质量无视。感谢之前的研究通过提出一种称为Sem-nCG的基于增益的自动度量来解决这些问题，它既具有排名和语义的意识。然而，Sem-nCG不考虑模型生成的摘要中存在的冗余数量，目前也不支持使用多个参考摘要进行评估。不幸的是，同时解决这两个限制并不容易。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一种冗余感知的Sem-nCG度量，并展示了如何使用这个新度量来评估模型摘要与多个参考摘要进行对比。我们还通过大量实验探索了将冗余纳入原始度量中的不同方式。实验结果表明，这种新的冗余感知度量具有更高的相关性。",
