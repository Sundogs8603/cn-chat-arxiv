    "translated_abstract": "资金风险预测在金融领域中起着至关重要的作用。机器学习方法已被广泛应用于自动检测潜在风险，从而节省劳动成本。然而，近年来这一领域的发展滞后于以下两个事实：1）所使用的算法有些过时，特别是在生成AI和大型语言模型（LLMs）快速发展的背景下；2）缺乏统一且开源的金融基准已经阻碍了相关研究多年。为解决这些问题，我们提出了FinPT和FinBench：前者是一种新颖的资金风险预测方法，对大型预训练基础模型进行个人资料调整；后者是一套关于资金风险的高质量数据集，如违约、欺诈和流失。在FinPT中，我们将金融表格数据填充到预定义的指令模板中，通过提示LLMs获得自然语言客户资料，并进行精调。",
