    "abstract": "Cryptocurrencies have become a popular and widely researched topic of interest in recent years for investors and scholars. In order to make informed investment decisions, it is essential to comprehend the factors that impact cryptocurrency prices and to identify risky cryptocurrencies. This paper focuses on analyzing historical data and using artificial intelligence algorithms on on-chain parameters to identify the factors affecting a cryptocurrency's price and to find risky cryptocurrencies. We conducted an analysis of historical cryptocurrencies' on-chain data and measured the correlation between the price and other parameters. In addition, we used clustering and classification in order to get a better understanding of a cryptocurrency and classify it as risky or not. The analysis revealed that a significant proportion of cryptocurrencies (39%) disappeared from the market, while only a small fraction (10%) survived for more than 1000 days. Our analysis revealed a significant negative",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，加密货币已成为投资者和学者广泛研究的热门话题。为了做出明智的投资决策，了解影响加密货币价格的因素并识别风险加密货币是至关重要的。本文重点分析历史数据，并使用人工智能算法对区块链参数进行分析，以识别影响加密货币价格的因素并找到风险加密货币。我们对历史加密货币的链上数据进行分析，并测量了价格与其他参数之间的相关性。此外，我们使用聚类和分类方法来更好地理解加密货币，并将其分类为风险或非风险。分析结果显示，大部分加密货币（39％）已退出市场，而只有很小一部分（10％）存活了1000多天。我们的分析揭示了一个显著的负相关关系",
