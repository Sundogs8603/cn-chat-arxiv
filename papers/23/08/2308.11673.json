Various approaches that employ combinations of physiological sensors for emotion recognition have been proposed. Yet, not all sensors are simple to use and handy for individuals in their daily lives. Thus, we propose a system to predict user emotion using smartwatch sensors. We design a framework to collect ground truth in real-time utilizing a mix of English and regional language-based videos to invoke emotions in participants and collect the data. Further, we modeled the problem as binary classification due to the limited dataset size and experimented with multiple machine-learning models. We also did an ablation study to understand the impact of features including Heart Rate, Accelerometer, and Gyroscope sensor data on mood. From",

    "translated_abstract": "情绪预测是研究理解人类情绪的领域。现有方法主要集中在文本、音频、面部表情等特征上，但这些特征可能对用户来说是私密的。情绪也可以从主题的心理数据中推导得到。已经提出了使用生理传感器组合进行情绪识别的各种方法。然而，并非所有传感器对用户在日常生活中使用都方便。因此，我们提出了使用智能手表传感器来预测用户情绪的系统。我们设计了一个框架，利用基于英语和区域语言的视频来引起参与者的情绪并收集数据，以实时采集真实数据。此外，由于数据集有限，我们将问题建模为二分类，并尝试了多种机器学习模型。我们还进行了消融研究，以了解心率、加速度计和陀螺仪传感器数据对心情的影响。",
