    "abstract": "Document scaling has been a key component in text-as-data applications for social scientists and a major field of interest for political researchers, who aim at uncovering differences between speakers or parties with the help of different probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches. Yet, most of these techniques are either built upon the agnostically bag-of-word hypothesis or use prior information borrowed from external sources that might embed the results with a significant bias. If the corpus has long been considered as a collection of documents, it can also be seen as a dense network of connected words whose structure could be clustered to differentiate independent groups of words, based on their co-occurrences in documents, known as communities. This paper introduces CommunityFish as an augmented version of Wordfish based on a hierarchical clustering, namely the Louvain algorithm, on the word space to yield communities as semantic and independent n-grams emerging from the corpus",
