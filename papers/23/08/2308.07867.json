    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于物理启发的图结构核设计，用于使用高斯过程进行功率流学习。该核被命名为顶点度核（VDK），它依赖于基于网络图或拓扑的电压注入关系的潜在分解。值得注意的是，VDK设计避免了需要解决核搜索的优化问题。为了提高效率，我们还探索了一种图缩减方法，以获得具有较少项的VDK表示。此外，我们提出了一种新颖的网络扫描主动学习方案，它智能地选择顺序训练输入，加速VDK的学习。利用VDK的可加性结构，主动学习算法对GP的预测方差进行了块下降类型的过程，作为信息增益的代理。仿真结果表明，所提出的VDK-GP与中等规模500个节点和大规模1354个节点的完整GP相比，实现了超过两倍的样本复杂度降低。",
