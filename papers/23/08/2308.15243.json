    "abstract": "This paper investigates the inter-rater reliability of risk assessment instruments (RAIs). The main question is whether different, socially salient groups are affected differently by a lack of inter-rater reliability of RAIs, that is, whether mistakes with respect to different groups affects them differently. The question is investigated with a simulation study of the COMPAS dataset. A controlled degree of noise is injected into the input data of a predictive model; the noise can be interpreted as a synthetic rater that makes mistakes. The main finding is that there are systematic differences in output reliability between groups in the COMPAS dataset. The sign of the difference depends on the kind of inter-rater statistic that is used (Cohen's Kappa, Byrt's PABAK, ICC), and in particular whether or not a correction of predictions prevalences of the groups is used.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了风险评估工具（RAIs）的评估者间可靠性。主要问题是不同的社会显著群体是否受到RAIs评估者间可靠性不足的影响，即不同群体的错误是否会对他们产生不同的影响。通过对COMPAS数据集进行模拟研究来调查这个问题。在预测模型的输入数据中注入了控制的噪声，这种噪声可以解释为制造错误的合成评估者。主要发现是COMPAS数据集中不同群体之间的输出可靠性存在系统差异。差异的方向取决于使用的评估者间统计量的类型（Cohen's Kappa、Byrt's PABAK、ICC），特别是是否使用了对群体预测概率进行修正。",
