    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了组织如何分配任务以确定最佳候选人晋升。任务分配和员工的动机通过组织的晋升决策相互作用。组织设计员工的职业生涯既从筛选又从培养人才的角度考虑。当只有非例行任务能够提供有关员工类型的信息，而非例行任务又很少时，组织更倾向于使用指数竞赛的晋升制度。每个员工被分配一个数字，该数字仅取决于他自身的类型。委托人将非例行任务分配给当前指数最高的员工，并晋升第一个超过阈值的员工。每个员工的阈值都独立于其他员工的类型。竞争通过任务分配来调节：谁有机会证明自己是晋升的决定性因素。最后，最佳晋升竞赛的特征解释了快速晋升的普遍性，以及高级职位的角色。",
