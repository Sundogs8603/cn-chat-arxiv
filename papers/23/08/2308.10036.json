    "translated_abstract": "在南非，车辆劫持问题日益严重。这导致旅行者时刻担心成为这种事件的受害者。本研究提出了一种新的半监督方法，使用推文来识别劫持事件，采用无监督异常检测算法。获取包含关键字\"劫持\"的推文，并使用词频-逆文档频率（TF-IDF）进行存储和处理，然后通过使用两种异常检测算法进行进一步分析：1）K最近邻（KNN）；2）基于聚类的异常因子（CBLOF）。比较评估结果表明，KNN方法的准确率为89%，而CBLOF的准确率为90%。CBLOF方法还能够获得0.8的F1-Score，而KNN的得分为0.78。因此，这两种方法有轻微差异，有利于CBLOF，被选为确定相关劫持事件的首选无监督方法。",
