    "translated_abstract": "新兴的工具带来了新的工作方法，自然科学领域也不例外。在自然科学中，传统的手工、串行和劳动密集型工作正被基于人工智能的实验自动化和更多的自动化、并行和迭代过程所取代。为了在自然科学中增加新的能力，加速和丰富发现过程的自动化，我们提出了DARWIN，一个面向自然科学的系列定制LLM，主要应用在物理学、化学和材料科学等领域。该系列依赖于开源LLM，将公共数据集和文献中的结构化和非结构化科学知识整合进来。我们使用了超过60,000个指令数据点对模型进行了微调，强调事实的正确性。在微调过程中，我们引入了科学指令生成（SIG）模型，从科学文本中自动生成指令。这消除了手动提取或领域特定知识的需求。",
