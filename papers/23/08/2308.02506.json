    "translated_abstract": "连贯性是评估文本可读性的一个关键方面，在评估论文时可以通过两个主要因素进行评估。第一个因素是逻辑连贯性，表现为适当使用话语连接词和建立句子之间的逻辑关系。第二个因素是标点符号的适当性，因为不适当的标点符号可能导致句子结构混乱。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个连贯性评分模型，其由一个具有两个特征提取器的回归模型组成：一个局部连贯性判别模型和一个标点符号修正模型。我们使用梯度提升回归树作为回归模型，并对输入特征施加了单调性约束。实验结果表明，我们提出的模型在未见数据上具有更好的泛化能力。该模型在NLPCC 2023共享任务7的第一赛道中获得了第三名。此外，我们还简要介绍了对于其他赛道的解决方案。",
