    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于数据驱动的框架，用于协作式网络化无人机在UTM系统中的宽带频谱感知和调度，这些无人机作为次要用户可以机会性地利用检测到的频谱空洞。为此，我们提出了一个多类别分类问题，用于基于采集到的I/Q样本检测空闲频谱位置。为了提高频谱感知模块的准确性，在无人机系统交通管理（UTM）生态系统中，通过将每个单个无人机的多类别分类的输出在服务器上进行融合。在频谱调度阶段，我们利用强化学习（RL）解决方案，动态地将检测到的频谱空洞分配给次要用户（即无人机）。为了评估所提出的方法，我们建立了一个综合的仿真框架，使用MATLAB LTE工具箱生成近真实的合成数据集，并将基站（BS）位置纳入到仿真中。",
