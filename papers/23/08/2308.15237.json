    "translated_abstract": "循环平稳性涉及信号和进程中的周期性统计变化，通常用于信号分析和网络安全。在攻击情境中，循环平稳性有助于检测网络流量中的恶意行为，如分布式拒绝服务（DDoS）攻击中的流量模式或恶意软件中的隐藏通信通道。该方法通过识别异常模式并通知网络入侵检测系统（NIDSs）识别潜在攻击，增强对已知和新颖威胁的保护。本研究的重点是识别循环平稳的恶意软件行为及其检测。主要目标是确定在NIDSs中使用的关键循环平稳特征。这些特征使用Boruta和主成分分析（PCA）等算法提取，然后进行分类以找到最重要的循环平稳模式。本文旨在通过循环平稳性揭示恶意软件行为的周期性变化。",
