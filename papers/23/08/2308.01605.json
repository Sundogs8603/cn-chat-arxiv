    "abstract": "Accurate predictions, as with machine learning, may not suffice to provide optimal healthcare for every patient. Indeed, prediction can be driven by shortcuts in the data, such as racial biases. Causal thinking is needed for data-driven decisions. Here, we give an introduction to the key elements, focusing on routinely-collected data, electronic health records (EHRs) and claims data. Using such data to assess the value of an intervention requires care: temporal dependencies and existing practices easily confound the causal effect. We present a step-by-step framework to help build valid decision making from real-life patient records by emulating a randomized trial before individualizing decisions, eg with machine learning. Our framework highlights the most important pitfalls and considerations in analysing EHRs or claims data to draw causal conclusions. We illustrate the various choices in studying the effect of albumin on sepsis mortality in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive C",

    "translated_abstract": "准确的预测，如同机器学习一样，可能无法为每个患者提供最佳医疗保健。确实，预测可能受到数据中的捷径（如种族偏见）的驱动。为数据驱动的决策需要因果思维。在这里，我们介绍关键要素，重点关注常规收集的数据，即电子健康记录（EHRs）和索赔数据。使用这些数据评估干预的价值需要谨慎：时间依赖性和现有实践很容易混淆因果效应。我们提供了一个逐步框架，帮助从真实患者记录中构建有效的决策，通过模拟随机试验来个性化决策，例如使用机器学习。我们的框架强调了分析EHRs或索赔数据以得出因果结论时最重要的陷阱和考虑因素。我们在用于重症医学信息市场中的肌酐对败血症死亡率的影响的研究中说明了各种选择。",
