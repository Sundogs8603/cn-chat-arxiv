    "translated_abstract": "预训练语言模型（PLMs）包含大量的事实知识，但其存储在参数中的方式尚不清楚。本文深入研究了多语言PLMs中事实知识的存储方式，并引入了一种基于体系结构的多语言整合梯度方法，相比现有方法更准确地定位知识神经元，并在不同体系结构和语言之间更具普遍性。此外，我们对知识神经元进行了深入探索，得出了以下两项重要的发现：（1）发现了语言无关知识神经元，其以超越语言的方式存储事实知识。我们设计了跨语言知识编辑实验，证明了PLMs可以基于语言无关的神经元完成此任务；（2）发现了退化知识神经元，这是一种新型神经元，表明不同的知识神经元可以在数据特征萎缩的情况下展示。",
