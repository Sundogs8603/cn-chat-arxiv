The solution is based on first-order logic extended with capabilities to represent the cardinality of variables, operating similarly to generalised quantifiers. To demonstrate the method, we designed an end-to-end system able to receive input as natural language, convert it into a formal logical representation, evaluate it, and return a result or send a command to a simulated robot.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种在人机交互背景下形式化自然语言量词的方法。该解决方案基于一阶逻辑并扩展了表示变量基数的能力，类似于广义量词。为了展示这种方法，我们设计了一个端到端的系统，能够接收自然语言输入，将其转换为形式化的逻辑表示，评估它，并返回结果或向模拟机器人发送命令。",
