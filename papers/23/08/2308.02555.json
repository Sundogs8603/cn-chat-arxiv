    "translated_abstract": "个性化的评论评分预测旨在利用现有的评论来建模用户兴趣和物品特征，以进行评分预测。大多数现有的研究主要遇到两个问题。首先，很少考虑每个评论的细粒度方面和知识图中包含的丰富知识，以补充纯文本，以更好地建模用户-物品交互。其次，尚未认真研究预训练语言模型在个性化评论评分预测中的作用。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种名为知识感知协同过滤与预训练语言模型（KCF-PLM）的方法。针对第一个问题，为了利用丰富的知识，KCF-PLM开发了一个Transformer网络，以对提取的方面与用户-物品对的交互进行建模。针对第二个问题，为了更好地表示用户和物品，KCF-PLM将用户或物品的所有历史评论作为预训练语言模型的输入。",
