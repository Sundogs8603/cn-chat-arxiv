    "translated_abstract": "重力恢复与气候实验（GRACE）卫星任务从2002年到2017年，为监测地球重力场变化提供了宝贵的数据集，为地球物理学和水文学等多种应用提供了支持。随后，在2018年，GRACE Follow-On继续进行数据收集。从卫星上不同仪器的集成导出的月度地球重力场数据，由于多种因素的影响，包括GRACE任务开始以来某些仪器的观测间断，存在不一致性。鉴于现在已经有二十多年的GRACE和GRACE Follow-On数据可用，本文提出了一种填充数据间断并预测GRACE加速计数据的方法。具体而言，我们着重于加速计数据，并采用长短期记忆（LSTM）网络来训练一个能够预测三个轴上加速计数据的模型。在本研究中，我们描述了预处理加速计数据的方法论。",
