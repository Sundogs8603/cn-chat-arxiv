    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习在电磁软件计算结果的预测方面一直是一个广泛讨论的问题。但预测准确率仍然是需要解决的挑战之一。在这项工作中，我们提出使用ResNets-10模型来预测等离子元布面的S11参数。通过k折交叉验证和小学习率进行两阶段训练。训练完成后，对于铝、金和银金属-绝缘体-金属布面的预测损失分别为-48.45、-46.47和-35.54。由于误差值极低，所提出的网络可以在一定结构范围内取代传统的电磁计算方法进行计算。此外，该网络的训练过程可以在不到1100个周期内完成。这意味着网络训练过程可以有效降低设计过程的时间。我们提出的ResNets-10模型还可以用于设计元-衍射装置和生物技术。",
