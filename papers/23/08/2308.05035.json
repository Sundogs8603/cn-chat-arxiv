    "translated_abstract": "在人工智能与人类协同系统的关键应用中，为了确保最小错误，用户应根据模型的置信度设定操作点，确定何时将决策委托给人类专家。模型置信度低于操作点的样本将由专家手动分析，以避免错误。只有在考虑到两个方面的情况下，这样的系统才能真正有用：模型只对准确的样本具有自信，并且尽量减少委托给专家的样本数量。后者对于可用专家时间有限且昂贵的应用，如医疗保健，尤为关键。模型准确性与委托给专家样本数量之间的权衡可以用类似ROC曲线的曲线表示，我们称之为置信度操作特性（COC）曲线。在本文中，我们认为应该通过考虑到模型的置信度和专家处理的样本数量来训练深度神经网络。",
