    "abstract": "Building socialbots that can have deep, engaging open-domain conversations with humans is one of the grand challenges of artificial intelligence (AI). To this end, bots need to be able to leverage world knowledge spanning several domains effectively when conversing with humans who have their own world knowledge. Existing knowledge-grounded conversation datasets are primarily stylized with explicit roles for conversation partners. These datasets also do not explore depth or breadth of topical coverage with transitions in conversations. We introduce Topical-Chat, a knowledge-grounded human-human conversation dataset where the underlying knowledge spans 8 broad topics and conversation partners don't have explicitly defined roles, to help further research in open-domain conversational AI. We also train several state-of-the-art encoder-decoder conversational models on Topical-Chat and perform automated and human evaluation for benchmarking.",

    "translated_abstract": "构建社交机器人能够与人类进行深入、有趣的开放域对话是人工智能的一项重要挑战。为了实现这一目标，机器人在与拥有自己世界知识的人类进行对话时，需要有效地利用涵盖多个领域的世界知识。现有的基于知识的对话数据集主要是具有明确角色的样式化数据集。这些数据集还没有探索对话中的主题涵盖的深度和广度。我们引入了Topical-Chat，这是一个基于知识的人-人对话数据集，其中的知识涵盖了8个广泛的主题，并且对话参与者没有明确定义的角色，以进一步促进开放域对话人工智能的研究。我们还在Topical-Chat上训练了几个最先进的编码器-解码器对话模型，并进行了自动化和人工评估以进行基准测试。",
