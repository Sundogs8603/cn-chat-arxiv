    "translated_abstract": "鉴于低标签率下经典Laplace学习算法退化的问题，我们提出将基于图的半监督学习重新表述为\\emph{Trust-Region Subproblem} (TRS) 的非凸推广。这个改进是受到Laplacian特征向量在无限未标记数据极限下的可解性的启发。为了解决这个问题，我们首先证明了一阶条件暗示了流形对齐问题的解，而且经典的\\emph{Orthogonal Procrustes} 问题的解可以被用于高效地找到适于进一步细化的好的分类器。接下来，我们解决了在低标签率下选择有监督样本的关键性。我们用图Laplacian的某个子矩阵的主特征向量推导出了一个新的中心度度量，来表征信息样本。我们证明了我们的框架与最近的最先进方法相比，能够实现更低的分类错误率。",
