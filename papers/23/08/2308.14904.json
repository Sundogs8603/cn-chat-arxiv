    "translated_abstract": "语义分割的主动学习(AL)由于严重的类别不平衡和不同方式定义的“样本”(像素、区域等)而具有挑战性，使得数据分布的解释模糊不清。我们提出“成熟度感知分布拆分的主动学习”(MADBAL)，一种从分层的角度定义多视图数据分布的主动学习方法，综合考虑了不同的“样本”定义，能够选择具有综合理解的最有影响力的分割像素。MADBAL还采用了一种新的不确定性表达方式，其中包括AL支持模块来感知特性的成熟度，其加权影响持续贡献于不确定性检测。通过这种方式，MADBAL即使在早期AL阶段也能取得显著的性能提升，从而显著减轻了训练负担。我们在Cityscapes和PASCAL VOC数据集上验证了MADBAL优于现有方法的性能。",
