    "translated_abstract": "脉冲神经网络 (SNNs) 是一种被广泛认为是传统人工神经网络的有希望的高效能替代品。然而，由于对 SNNs 通常被认为是稀疏激活的先入为主的印象，对于 SNNs 中固有冗余性的分析和优化往往被忽视，这样就干扰了基于脉冲的神经形态计算在准确性和能量效率方面的潜在优势。本文提出并关注了关于 SNNs 中固有冗余性的三个关键问题。我们认为冗余性是由于 SNNs 的时空不变性引起的，这增强了参数利用的效率，但也引来了大量的噪声脉冲。进一步，我们分析了时空不变性对 SNNs 的时空动态和脉冲激活的影响。然后，受到这些分析的启发，我们提出了一种高级空间注意力 (ASA) 模块，以利用 SNNs 的冗余性，该模块可以通过一对适应性优化膜电势分布。",
