    "abstract": "Internet Memes remain a challenging form of user-generated content for automated sentiment classification. The availability of labelled memes is a barrier to developing sentiment classifiers of multimodal memes. To address the shortage of labelled memes, we propose to supplement the training of a multimodal meme classifier with unimodal (image-only and text-only) data. In this work, we present a novel variant of supervised intermediate training that uses relatively abundant sentiment-labelled unimodal data. Our results show a statistically significant performance improvement from the incorporation of unimodal text data. Furthermore, we show that the training set of labelled memes can be reduced by 40% without reducing the performance of the downstream model.",

    "translated_abstract": "互联网表情包作为用户生成的内容之一，对于自动情感分类来说仍然具有挑战。已标记的表情包的可用性是开发多模态表情包分类器的一种障碍。为了解决标记表情包数量不足的问题，我们提出使用单模态(仅图像和仅文本)数据来补充多模态表情包分类器的训练。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的监督式中间训练的变体，使用相对丰富的情感标记单模态数据。我们的结果表明，与单模态文本数据的融合可以显著提高性能。此外，我们还表明，可以将标记表情包的训练集减少40%，而不降低下游模型的性能。",
