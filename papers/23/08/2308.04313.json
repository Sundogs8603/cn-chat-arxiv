    "abstract": "At the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2023, Apple introduced the Vision Pro. The Vision Pro is a Mixed Reality (MR) headset, more specifically it is a Virtual Reality (VR) device with an additional Video See-Through (VST) capability. The VST capability turns the Vision Pro also into an Augmented Reality (AR) device. The AR feature is enabled by streaming the real world via cameras to the (VR) screens in front of the user's eyes. This is of course not unique and similar to other devices, like the Varjo XR-3. Nevertheless, the Vision Pro has some interesting features, like an inside-out screen that can show the headset wearers' eyes to \"outsiders\" or a button on the top, called \"Digital Crown\", that allows you to seamlessly blend digital content with your physical space by turning it. In addition, it is untethered, except for the cable to the battery, which makes the headset more agile, compared to the Varjo XR-3. This could actually come closer to the \"Ultimate Display\",",

    "translated_abstract": "在2023年6月的全球开发者大会（WWDC）上，苹果推出了Vision Pro。Vision Pro是一款混合现实（MR）头盔，更具体地说，它是一款具有额外视频透视（VST）能力的虚拟现实（VR）设备。通过将真实世界通过摄像头传输到用户眼前的（VR）屏幕，使得Vision Pro也成为了增强现实（AR）设备。当然，这并不独特，与Varjo XR-3等其他设备类似。尽管如此，Vision Pro具有一些有趣的特点，例如内部屏幕可以向“外界”显示佩戴头盔者的眼睛，或者顶部的一个按钮称为“数字皇冠”，可以通过旋转无缝地融合数字内容与物理空间。此外，Vision Pro是无线的，只有电池的电缆连接，这使得头盔比Varjo XR-3更加灵活。这可能更接近“终极显示器”。",
