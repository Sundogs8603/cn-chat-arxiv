    "abstract": "Environmental sound scene and sound event recognition is important for the recognition of suspicious events in indoor and outdoor environments (such as nurseries, smart homes, nursing homes, etc.) and is a fundamental task involved in many audio surveillance applications. In particular, there is no public common data set for the research field of sound event recognition for the data set of the indoor environmental sound scene. Therefore, this paper proposes a data set (called as AGS) for the home environment sound. This data set considers various types of overlapping audio in the scene, background noise. Moreover, based on the proposed data set, this paper compares and analyzes the advanced methods for sound event recognition, and then illustrates the reliability of the data set proposed in this paper, and studies the challenges raised by the new data set.

    "translated_abstract": "环境声音场景和声音事件识别对于室内和室外环境中可疑事件的识别（如托儿所、智能家居、养老院等）非常重要，也是许多音频监控应用中的基本任务。尤其是在室内环境声音场景的声音事件识别研究领域中，尚未有公共的常见数据集。因此，本文提出了一种用于家庭环境声音的数据集（称为AGS）。该数据集考虑了场景中各种类型的重叠音频和背景噪声。此外，基于提出的数据集，本文对声音事件识别的先进方法进行了比较和分析，并验证了本文提出的数据集的可靠性，并研究了新数据集带来的挑战。",
