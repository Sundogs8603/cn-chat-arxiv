    "translated_abstract": "虚假信息的快速传播和对在线社交网络的持续操纵攻击，往往是出于政治、意识形态或经济利益，已经影响了在线社交网络的开放性。虽然来自不同学科的研究人员已经调查了在线社交网络中不同操纵引发要素（如了解信息在在线社交网络上的传播或检测账户的自动化行为），但这些工作没有被整合起来以提供对这些要素之间相互关系的全面概述。值得注意的是，以往的研究忽视了用户心理、机器人的普及程度以及它们与虚假信息检测的策略之间的关系。为了填补这一研究空白，本文综合了来自各个学科的见解，提供了对操纵领域的全面分析。通过整合社交媒体操纵的主要要素，包括虚假信息、机器人和恶意宣传，我们广泛地研究了每个社交媒体操纵的方面。",
