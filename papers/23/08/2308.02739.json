    "abstract": "We study the dynamic effects of fires on county labor markets in the US using a novel geophysical measure of fire exposure based on satellite imagery. We find increased fire exposure causes lower employment growth in the short and medium run, with medium-run effects being linked to migration. We also document heterogeneous effects across counties by education and industrial concentration levels, states of the business cycle, and fire size. By overcoming challenges in measuring fire impacts, we identify vulnerable places and economic states, offering guidance on tailoring relief efforts and contributing to a broader understanding of natural disasters' economic impacts.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们利用基于卫星图像的火灾暴露的新颖地球物理测量方法，研究了火灾对美国县级劳动力市场的动态影响。我们发现火灾暴露增加会导致短期和中期就业增长下降，其中中期效应与人口迁移有关。我们还记录了受教育程度和产业集中度、商业周期状态以及火灾规模等因素对县级的异质性影响。通过克服火灾影响的测量难题，我们确定了脆弱的地区和经济状况，并为定制救助措施提供指导，同时为更广泛地理解自然灾害的经济影响做出贡献。",
