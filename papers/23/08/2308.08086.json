However, the architectural complexity and nonlinearity of the NNs make it challenging to synthesize a provably safe controller. In this work, we propose a novel safety filter that relies on convex optimization to ensure safety for a NN system, subject to additive disturbances that are capable of capturing modeling errors. Our approach leverages tools from NN verification to over-approximate NN dynamics with a set of linear bounds, followed by an application of robust linear MPC to search for controllers that can guarantee robust constraint satisfaction.

    "translated_abstract": "随着数据可用性的增加，已经广泛证明神经网络（NN）能够以数据驱动的方式准确捕获复杂的系统动态。然而，NN的架构复杂性和非线性使得对其合成一个能够被证明是安全的控制器变得具有挑战性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的安全过滤器，它依靠凸优化来确保NN系统的安全性，同时能够捕获建模误差。我们的方法利用NN验证工具来使用一组线性边界来近似NN的动态，然后应用鲁棒线性模型预测控制（robust linear MPC）来寻找可以保证鲁棒约束满足的控制器。我们通过数值实验在非线性摆系统上展示了所提出框架的有效性。",
