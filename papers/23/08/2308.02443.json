    "abstract": "The process of conducting literature reviews is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To streamline this process, I present an AI Literature Review Suite that integrates several functionalities to provide a comprehensive literature review. This tool leverages the power of open access science, large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing to enable the searching, downloading, and organizing of PDF files, as well as extracting content from articles. Semantic search queries are used for data retrieval, while text embeddings and summarization using LLMs present succinct literature reviews. Interaction with PDFs is enhanced through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). The suite also features integrated programs for bibliographic organization, interaction and query, and literature review summaries. This tool presents a robust solution to automate and optimize the process of literature review in academic and industrial research.",

    "translated_abstract": "进行文献综述往往是一项耗时且工作量大的过程。为了简化这个过程，我提出了一个AI文献综述套件，集成了多种功能，提供了全面的文献综述。该工具利用开放访问科学、大型语言模型和自然语言处理的能力，实现了PDF文件的搜索、下载和整理，以及从文章中提取内容。语义搜索查询用于数据检索，而使用大型语言模型的文本嵌入和摘要提供简明的文献综述。通过用户友好的图形用户界面（GUI），增强了与PDF的交互。该套件还具有用于文献资料组织、交互和查询以及文献综述摘要的集成程序。这个工具提供了一个强大的解决方案，以自动化和优化学术和工业研究中的文献综述过程。",
