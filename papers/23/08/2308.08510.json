    "translated_abstract": "机器人在探索海洋中扮演着人类操作者的物理代理的关键角色。然而，在高压水环境下完全浸没并且受到少量可见光影响时，可靠地抓取物体仍然具有挑战性，主要是由于指尖与物体表面之间的流体干扰对触觉力学的影响。本研究通过基于视觉的柔性机器手指，使用监督式变分自动编码器（SVAE）学习6D力和力矩（FT）来探索从陆地到水下的抓取知识的可转移性。高帧率摄像机捕捉到机器手指在陆地和水下与物理物体互动时的整体变形。结果表明，训练得到的SVAE模型学到了一系列可从陆地转移到水下的柔性力学的潜在表示，相对商业FT传感器而言，对不断变化的环境具有更好的适应性。通过柔软、精细和反应灵敏的抓取，能够实现...",
