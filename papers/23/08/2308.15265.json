    "abstract": "We introduce a novel re-ranking model that aims to augment the functionality of standard search engines to support classroom search activities for children (ages 6 to 11). This model extends the known listwise learning-to-rank framework by balancing risk and reward. Doing so enables the model to prioritize Web resources of high educational alignment, appropriateness, and adequate readability by analyzing the URLs, snippets, and page titles of Web resources retrieved by a given mainstream search engine. Experimental results, including an ablation study and comparisons with existing baselines, showcase the correctness of the proposed model. The outcomes of this work demonstrate the value of considering multiple perspectives inherent to the classroom setting, e.g., educational alignment, readability, and objectionability, when applied to the design of algorithms that can better support children's information discovery.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种新颖的重新排序模型，旨在增强标准搜索引擎的功能，以支持6至11岁儿童的课堂搜索活动。该模型通过平衡风险和回报扩展了已知的整体排序学习框架。通过分析给定主流搜索引擎检索到的Web资源的URL、片段和页面标题，该模型能够优先考虑高教育一致性、适当性和可读性的Web资源。实验结果包括消融研究和与现有基线的比较，展示了所提出模型的正确性。这项工作的结果证明了在设计能够更好地支持儿童信息发现的算法时，考虑到教室环境中的多个视角的价值，例如教育一致性、可读性和反对性。",
