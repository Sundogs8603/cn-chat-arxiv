    "translated_abstract": "实际世界中的图是动态的，不断随着新的交互而发展，比如金融网络中的金融交易。时间图神经网络(TGNN)已经被开发出来，以有效地捕捉动态图中不断演变的模式。虽然这些模型表现出了它们的优越性，并被广泛应用于各个重要领域，但它们对抗性攻击的脆弱性仍然鲜为人知。在本文中，我们提出了T-SPEAR，这是一种简单而有效的针对连续时间动态图上的链路预测的对抗攻击方法，重点研究了TGNN的脆弱性。具体而言，在一个针对链路预测的TGNN受害模型的训练过程之前，我们向数据注入边缘扰动，这些扰动在我们提出的四个约束条件方面是不可察觉的，但足以导致受害模型的故障。此外，我们提出了一种强大的训练方法。",
