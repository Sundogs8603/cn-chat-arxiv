    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人工上涌（AU）作为一种将富含营养的底层水提升到海面、刺激海藻生长并增加海洋碳封存的方法，受到了越来越多的关注。这导致在中国开发了第一个太阳能供电和空气增压的AU系统（AUS）。然而，在复杂的海洋环境中高效调度气体喷射系统仍然是操作AUS的关键挑战，因为它有潜力显著提高能源效率。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种利用深度强化学习（DRL）算法开发AUS运行的高效策略的新能源管理方法。具体而言，我们将最大化AUS能源效率的问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，并将分布式强化学习（QR-DQN）中的分位网络与深度竞争网络相结合以解决这个问题。通过大量的仿真实验，我们证明了我们的方法可以显著提高AUS的能源效率。",
