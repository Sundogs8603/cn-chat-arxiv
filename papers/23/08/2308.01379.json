    "translated_abstract": "长曝光摄影产生令人惊叹的图像，用运动模糊来表现场景中的移动元素。它通常分为两种模式，一种是产生前景模糊效果，一种是产生背景模糊效果。传统上，前景模糊图像是在三脚架上的相机上拍摄的，描绘出模糊的移动前景元素（如丝绸般的水流或光迹），而背景则呈现出完全清晰的背景景观。背景模糊图像，也称为跟拍摄影，是在相机追踪移动对象时拍摄的，以产生一个清晰的主体图像和一个因相对运动而模糊的背景。这两种技术都非常具有挑战性，需要额外的设备和高级技能。在本文中，我们描述了一种在手持智能手机相机应用中运行的计算爆发摄影系统，可以在按下快门按钮时完全自动地实现这些效果。我们的方法首先检测和分割显著主体。我们跟踪场景中的所有动态元素，以估计它们在图像序列中的运动轨迹，并通过对图像序列的帧进行融合，生成合成图像。",
