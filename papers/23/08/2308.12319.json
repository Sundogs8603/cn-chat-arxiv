In this paper, we perform the first comprehensive investigation of DNN fingerprint removal attacks. Generally, the knowledge contained in a DNN model can be categorized into general semantic and fingerprint-specific knowledge. To this end, we propose a min-max bilevel optimization-based DNN fingerprint removal attack named RemovalNet, to evade model ownership verification.

    "translated_abstract": "随着深度神经网络(DNNs)性能的显著提升，DNNs在许多领域得到了广泛应用。因此，DNN模型已经成为一项宝贵的资产，其知识产权通过所有权验证技术（如DNN指纹）得到保护。然而，DNN指纹去除攻击的可行性及其潜在影响仍然是一个未解决的问题。本文首次对DNN指纹去除攻击进行了全面的调查。一般而言，DNN模型中包含的知识可以分为通用语义知识和指纹特定知识。为此，我们提出了一种基于min-max双层优化的DNN指纹去除攻击——RemovalNet，以逃避模型所有权验证。下层优化旨在去除指纹特定知识，而上层优化则在维持替代模型性能的同时提取受害模型的通用语义知识。",
