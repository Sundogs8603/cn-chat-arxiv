    "abstract": "Text injection for automatic speech recognition (ASR), wherein unpaired text-only data is used to supplement paired audio-text data, has shown promising improvements for word error rate. This study examines the use of text injection for auxiliary tasks, which are the non-ASR tasks often performed by an E2E model. In this work, we use joint end-to-end and internal language model training (JEIT) as our text injection algorithm to train an ASR model which performs two auxiliary tasks. The first is capitalization, which is a de-normalization task. The second is turn-taking prediction, which attempts to identify whether a user has completed their conversation turn in a digital assistant interaction. We show results demonstrating that our text injection method boosts capitalization performance for long-tail data, and improves turn-taking detection recall.",

    "translated_abstract": "文本注入用于自动语音识别（ASR），其中非配对的纯文本数据用于补充音频-文本数据，已显示出对词错误率有显著改善。该研究研究了文本注入用于辅助任务，在E2E模型中常用于非ASR任务。在本研究中，我们使用联合端到端和内部语言模型训练（JEIT）作为我们的文本注入算法，训练一个ASR模型来完成两个辅助任务。第一个任务是大写，是一种去标准化任务。第二个任务是交替预测，尝试识别用户是否已完成对话交替，在数字助理互动中。我们展示了我们的文本注入方法能提升长尾数据的大写性能，并改善了交替检测的召回率。",
