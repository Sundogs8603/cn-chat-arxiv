    "abstract": "We introduce AbDiffuser, an equivariant and physics-informed diffusion model for the joint generation of antibody 3D structures and sequences. AbDiffuser is built on top of a new representation of protein structure, relies on a novel architecture for aligned proteins, and utilizes strong diffusion priors to improve the denoising process. Our approach improves protein diffusion by taking advantage of domain knowledge and physics-based constraints; handles sequence-length changes; and reduces memory complexity by an order of magnitude enabling backbone and side chain generation. We validate AbDiffuser in silico and in vitro. Numerical experiments showcase the ability of AbDiffuser to generate antibodies that closely track the sequence and structural properties of a reference set. Laboratory experiments confirm that all 16 HER2 antibodies discovered were expressed at high levels and that 57.1% of selected designs were tight binders.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一个名为AbDiffuser的等变物理性扩散模型，用于联合生成抗体的三维结构和序列。AbDiffuser建立在一种新的蛋白质结构表示上，依赖于一种针对齐位蛋白的新型架构，并利用强扩散先验改善去噪过程。我们的方法通过利用领域知识和基于物理的约束改善了蛋白质扩散；处理序列长度变化；并将内存复杂性降低一个数量级，实现了骨架和侧链的生成。我们在体内和体外验证了AbDiffuser。数值实验展示了AbDiffuser生成与参考集合的序列和结构特性密切匹配的抗体的能力。实验室实验证实，发现的16种HER2抗体均以高水平表达，并且57.1%的设计选择是紧密结合剂。",
