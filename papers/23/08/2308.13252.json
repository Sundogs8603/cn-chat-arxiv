    "translated_abstract": "置换矩阵在匹配和分配问题中起着关键作用，尤其在计算机视觉和机器人领域。然而，显式表示置换矩阵的内存随问题规模的增大呈二次增长，限制了大规模问题的解决。本文提出通过使用低秩矩阵分解和非线性逼近来解决大型置换矩阵的维度灾难。为此，我们依靠\"亲吻数\"理论来推断表示给定大小的置换矩阵所需的最小秩，该秩明显小于问题的大小。这导致计算和内存成本的大幅降低，例如，在表示$n=20000$的问题时，仅使用两个小矩阵中的$8.4\\times10^5$个元素，而不是使用一个包含$4\\times 10^8$个元素的巨大矩阵，内存节省了$3$个数量级。所提出的表示方法可以实现准确的表达。",
