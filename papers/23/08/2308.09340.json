This expensive activity motivated much work in developing methods for constructing benchmarks with fewer assessment costs. In this respect, adjudication methods actively decide both which documents and the order in which experts review them, in order to better exploit the assessment budget or to lower it. Researchers evaluate the quality of those methods by measuring the correlation between the known gold ranking of systems under the full collection and the observed ranking of systems under the lower-cost one. This traditional analysis ignores whether and how the low-cost judgements impact on the statistically significant differences among systems with respect to the full collection. We fill this void by proposing a novel methodology to evaluate how the low-cost adjudication methods preserve the pairwise significant differences between systems as the full collection. In other",

    "translated_abstract": "创建离线检索评估的测试集需要人工判断文档的相关性。在减少评估成本方面，裁决方法积极决定专家审查文档的顺序，以更好地利用评估预算或降低其成本。研究人员通过测量完整集合下已知系统的金标排名与低成本集合下系统的观察排名之间的相关性来评估这些方法的质量。这种传统分析忽略了低成本裁决对于完整集合中系统之间的统计显著差异是否以及如何影响。我们通过提出一种新方法来评估低成本裁决方法在保持完整集合中系统之间成对显著差异方面的能力来填补这一空白。",
