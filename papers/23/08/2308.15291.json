    "translated_abstract": "深度学习已成为自动心电图分析的首选建模方法。本研究探讨了三个旨在提高这种系统定量准确性的要素。这些组件始终超越了基于卷积模型的现有最先进技术，并通过利用结构化状态空间模型(SSMs)来提高性能。这些模型在捕捉时间序列数据中的长期依赖方面显示了很大的潜力。通过将SSMs纳入我们的方法中，我们不仅实现了更好的性能，还对该领域的长期相关问题有了更深的理解。具体而言，对于标准诊断任务，我们发现与100Hz相比，使用500Hz等更高采样率没有优势。类似地，将模型的输入尺寸扩大到3秒以上也没有带来显著的改进。其次，我们证明了使用对比预测的自监督学习能够增强模型的性能，这是第二个要素。",
