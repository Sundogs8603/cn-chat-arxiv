    "translated_abstract": "移动增强现实（MAR）被广泛认为是数字孪生和元宇宙的普遍接口之一，要求具有前所未有的延迟、计算能力和能效。现有的实现MAR的解决方案将边缘计算、云计算和第五代（5G）网络等多种技术结合起来。然而，视觉数据的固有通信延迟对体验质量（QoE）造成明显的限制。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种新兴的语义通信框架，用于学习MAR中的通信协议。具体而言，我们通过改进的Lewis信令博弈来训练两个代理，以形成离散的通信协议。基于这个协议，两个代理可以通过极小数据大小的消息在嘈杂的信道中相互传达有关视觉数据的抽象思想，从而导致消息错误。为了更好地模拟真实世界的场景，我们将信道不确定性纳入模型中。",
