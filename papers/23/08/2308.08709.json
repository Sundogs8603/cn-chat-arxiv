    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络(DNNs)已被用于解决各种日常问题。近年来，DNNs已被部署在实时系统中，降低能量消耗和响应时间已成为当务之急。为了解决这个场景，研究人员提出了将动态机制引入静态DNNs(SDNN)以创建能够根据输入复杂性执行动态计算的动态神经网络(DyNNs)。尽管在实时系统中将动态机制引入SDNNs更可取，但评估动态机制引入对模型鲁棒性的影响也变得重要。然而，目前还没有大量的研究关注SDNNs和DyNNs之间的鲁棒性权衡。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了研究动态机制在DyNNs中的鲁棒性以及动态机制设计对DyNNs的影响。为此，我们评估了三个研究问题。",
