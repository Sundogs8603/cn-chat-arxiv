    "translated_abstract": "股市是最令人着迷的研究领域之一，预测股票价格可以帮助投资者在正确的时间做出最佳决策从而获利。深度学习策略已经成为金融市场领域的关键技术。股市受两个方面的影响，一方面是地缘政治、社会和全球事件，这些事件可能影响价格趋势。与此同时，第二个方面纯粹关注历史价格趋势和季节性，使我们能够预测股票价格。本文旨在专注于第二个方面，建立一个能够以最小误差预测未来价格的模型。为了提供更好的股票价格预测结果，我们提出了一个名为长短期记忆 (LSTM) 和顺序自注意力机制 (LSTM-SSAM) 的新模型。最后，我们对三个股票数据集进行了广泛的实验：SBIN、HDFCBANK 和 BANKBARODA。实验结果证明了模型的有效性。",
