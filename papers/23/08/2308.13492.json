    "abstract": "Due to the lack of more efficient diagnostic tools for monkeypox, its spread remains unchecked, presenting a formidable challenge to global health. While the high efficacy of deep learning models for monkeypox diagnosis has been demonstrated in related studies, the overlook of inference speed, the parameter size and diagnosis performance for early-stage monkeypox renders the models inapplicable in real-world settings. To address these challenges, we proposed an ultrafast and ultralight network named Fast-MpoxNet. Fast-MpoxNet possesses only 0.27M parameters and can process input images at 68 frames per second (FPS) on the CPU. To counteract the diagnostic performance limitation brought about by the small model capacity, it integrates the attention-based feature fusion module and the multiple auxiliary losses enhancement strategy for better detecting subtle image changes and optimizing weights. Using transfer learning and five-fold cross-validation, Fast-MpoxNet achieves 94.26% Accuracy",

    "translated_abstract": "由于缺乏更高效的猴痘诊断工具，其传播仍然未受控制，给全球健康带来了巨大的挑战。虽然相关研究已经证明了深度学习模型在猴痘诊断方面的高效性，但是对于早期猴痘的推理速度、参数大小和诊断性能的忽视使得这些模型无法在现实世界中应用。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种超快超轻的网络，名为Fast-MpoxNet。Fast-MpoxNet只有0.27M个参数，并且可以在CPU上以每秒68帧的速度处理输入图像。为了克服小模型容量带来的诊断性能限制，它集成了基于注意力的特征融合模块和多个辅助损失增强策略，以更好地检测微小的图像变化和优化权重。通过转移学习和五折交叉验证，Fast-MpoxNet实现了94.26%的准确率。",
