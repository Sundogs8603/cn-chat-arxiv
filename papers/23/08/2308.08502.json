    "translated_abstract": "全球各地的公司都渴望定位潜在的高价值客户，以扩大收入，而这只能通过更好地了解客户来实现。客户终身价值（CLV）是客户在一段规定的时间内与企业进行的交易/购买的总货币价值，用于预测未来客户互动。CLV在多个不同的商业领域中都有应用，如银行，保险，在线娱乐，游戏和电子商务。现有的基于分布和基本（最近性，频率和金额）的模型在处理各种输入特征方面存在限制。此外，更先进的深度学习方法可能过于复杂，在某些应用领域中增加了不必要的复杂性。因此，我们提出了一个既能够有效又全面简单易懂的系统。考虑到这一点，我们开发了一个基于元学习的堆叠回归方法，用于客户终身价值预测。",
