    "translated_abstract": "确定性规划假设规划沿着完全可预测的路径发展，因此在大多数真实的情景中失去了实际价值。更现实的观点是规划应该事先考虑到部分可观察性，并为更灵活和稳健的解决方案而努力。而且更重要的是，在部分可观察环境中规划的质量不可避免地变化较大。在本文中，我们提出了一个概率性依赖Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) 规划器，称为High-Quality Contingent Planner (HQCP)，以在部分可观察环境中生成高质量的计划。我们将HTN规划中的形式化扩展到部分可观测性，并对其成本进行评估。接着，我们探索了一种新颖的高质量计划启发式规则，并开发了集成规划算法。最后，一项实证研究验证了规划器在概率性依赖规划和高质量计划方面的有效性和效率。",
