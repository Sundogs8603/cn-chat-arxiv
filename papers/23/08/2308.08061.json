    "translated_abstract": "在为任何产品/应用程序在生产环境中部署机器学习模型时，通常希望具备三个属性。首先，模型应具有泛化能力，即在我们对领域知识的发展中可以扩展其用途。其次，它们应该是可评估的，这样在生产环境中可以有清晰的性能指标和计算这些指标的可行方式。最后，部署应尽可能地成本最优。在本文中，我们提出这三个目标（即泛化、评估和成本最优化）在大型语言模型中往往是相对独立的，并且对于大型语言模型，尽管其在传统NLP模型上表现出色，但企业在对这项技术进行重大投资之前需要仔细评估所有三个因素。我们提出了一个特别针对大型语言模型的泛化、评估和成本建模框架，为企业提供深入了解这些复杂因素的洞察力。",
