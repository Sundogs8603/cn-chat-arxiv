    "translated_abstract": "现实世界中的不确定性意味着系统设计者无法预测并明确设计出机器人可能遇到的所有场景。因此，以这种方式设计的机器人在高度受控的环境之外容易出现故障。因果模型提供了一个原则性的框架，用于编码机器人与其环境相互作用的因果关系的形式化知识，并结合现实世界机器人通常遇到的噪声和不确定性的概率表示。结合因果推断，这些模型使自主代理能够理解、推理和解释其环境。在这项工作中，我们关注机器人堆积方块任务的问题，因为它展示了许多应用所需的基本感知和操作能力，包括仓库物流和家庭人工支持机器人。我们提出了一个新颖的因果性概率框架，将物理模拟功能嵌入到这个任务中。",
