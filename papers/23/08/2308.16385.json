    "translated_abstract": "为了处理特征或连接在演化的图中的时间，已经提出了一系列的时间图神经网络（TGNNs）。尽管这些TGNN取得了成功，但以往的TGNN评估揭示了四个关键问题上的几个限制：1）数据集不一致，2）评估流程不一致，3）缺乏工作负载多样性，4）缺乏有效的比较。总的来说，缺乏一个将TGNN模型放在同一起跑线上并全面比较它们的实证研究。为此，我们提出了BenchTemp，一个用于在各种工作负载上评估TGNN模型的通用基准。BenchTemp提供一组基准数据集，以便可以公平地比较不同的TGNN模型。此外，BenchTemp还设计了一个标准流程，统一了TGNN的评估。借助BenchTemp，我们广泛比较了不同任务（例如链接预测和节点分类）和设置（传递和归纳）下的代表性TGNN模型。",
