    "translated_abstract": "在机器人学习中，强大而高效的学习仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，特别是对于复杂的视觉输入。受到人类注意机制的启发，我们认为将关注焦点的辅助信息嵌入到机器人学习中，将提高学习过程的效率和稳健性。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，用一个近似预测模型来建模和模拟人类的注意力。然后，我们将这个输出作为结构化的辅助特征图传递给下游的学习任务。我们通过在真实世界的手动驾驶中，从人类注视记录中学习预测模型来验证这个想法。我们在两个学习任务中进行了测试——目标检测和模仿学习。我们的实验表明，将预测的人类关注引入到训练模型中，可以提高模型对于分布之外样本的稳健性，同时也能实现更快的学习速度。",
