    "translated_abstract": "深度学习技术对标注数据的巨大需求引发了注释噪声的问题。尽管这个问题在机器学习文献中广泛讨论，但在\"多标签分类\"（MLC）任务的复杂噪声情况下，却相对未经探索。此外，当所涉及的领域具有某些逻辑约束时，噪声标注常常加剧违规情况，使得该系统被专家认为是不可接受的。本文研究了标签噪声对MLC任务中领域规则违规事件的影响，并将领域规则纳入我们的学习算法，以减轻噪声的影响。我们提出了\"Domain Obedient Self-supervised Training\"（DOST）范式，不仅可以使深度学习模型更符合领域规则，还可以在关键指标上提高学习性能，并最小化注释噪声的影响。这种新颖的方法使用领域指导训练技术。",
