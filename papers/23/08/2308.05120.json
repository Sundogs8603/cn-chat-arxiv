    "translated_abstract": "在最近几年中，数据驱动的基于神经网络的机器学习算法在仪器与控制系统中的适用性研究方面取得了显著进展。虽然它们在操作环境中具有潜力，但这些算法的可信度尚未得到充分评估。机器学习集成系统的故障情况尚不清楚；缺乏全面的风险建模可能会降低这些系统的可信度。最近国家标准与技术研究所的报告指出，机器学习的可信度是采用的关键障碍，并且将在智能系统的安全和可追溯运行中发挥关键作用。因此，在本研究中，我们演示了一种实时的模型不可知方法，通过在训练数据集上结合超出分布检测来评估ML预测的相对可靠性。已有文献证明，ML算法在插值（或接近插值）任务方面表现出色，但在超出训练数据分布的情况下会明显下降。",
