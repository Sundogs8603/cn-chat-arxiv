    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)如ChatGPT正变得越来越复杂，展示出与人类相似的能力。这些AI模型在日常生活中辅助人类完成各种任务方面发挥着重要作用。AI作为聊天代理人的重要应用是回答人类在各个领域的问题。目前的LLMs在回答一般问题方面已经显示出熟练的能力。然而，在复杂的诊断场景(如法律或医疗咨询)中，基本的问答对话往往表现不佳。这些场景通常需要任务导向对话(TOD)，其中AI聊天代理需要主动提问并引导用户完成特定任务。以前的微调模型在TOD方面表现不佳，而当前的LLMs并未固有这种能力。在本文中，我们介绍了一种名为DiagGPT (Diagnosis GPT)的创新方法，它将LLMs推广到TOD场景中。",
