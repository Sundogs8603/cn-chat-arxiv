    "translated_abstract": "网状在三维计算机视觉和图形中得到广泛应用，但它们的不规则拓扑结构给现有神经网络架构的应用带来了挑战。最新的网状神经网络的进展转向了重网状和推动了仅将原始网状作为输入的先驱方法的边界。虽然重网状提供了一种规则的拓扑结构，从而显著促进了网状网络架构的设计，但是从这种重网状代理中提取的特征可能会难以准确保留底层几何性质，从而限制了后续神经网络的容量。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了SieveNet，一种同时考虑规则拓扑和准确几何的新范式。具体而言，该方法利用了从重网状中提取得到的结构化网状拓扑以及原始网状表面上基于畸变感知的点采样得到的准确几何信息。此外，我们的方法消除了对手工特征工程的需求，并且可以利用。",
