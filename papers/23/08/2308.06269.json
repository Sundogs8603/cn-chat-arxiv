    "translated_abstract": "鉴于对狗行为研究的实际应用，例如选育选择、工作适应能力预测、被收养机会等，对狗行为特征的评估是一个经过广泛研究的挑战。目前大多数评估狗行为特征的方法是基于问卷或观察，需要大量时间、精力和专业知识。此外，这些方法也容易受到主观性和偏见的影响，缺乏可靠性。本研究提出了一种自动化的计算方法，可能提供一种更客观、稳健和资源高效的替代方案。我们使用了一部分陌生人测试协议，对53只狗进行了对陌生人出现和良性行为的反应测试。三位专家评分狗的应对风格。此外，我们还使用了犬行为评估和研究问卷（C-BARQ）收集了其处理者的数据。对狗的轨迹进行无监督聚类分析，揭示了两个主要聚类。",
