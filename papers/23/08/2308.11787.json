    "translated_abstract": "机器人和自动化可以大大加速解决材料发现等难以解决的多变量科学问题，但可用的搜索空间可能非常庞大。贝叶斯优化已经成为一种受欢迎的样本高效优化引擎，在没有目标函数或属性的解析形式被知道的任务中获得了成功。在这里，我们利用专家人类知识以假设的形式，更快地将贝叶斯搜索引导到有希望的化学空间区域。先前的方法使用从现有实验测量得到的潜在分布，这对于新的未开发的科学任务是不可行的。此外，这样的分布无法捕捉精细的假设。我们提出的方法，称为HypBO，利用专家人类假设生成改进的样本种子。不太有希望的种子自动折扣，而有希望的种子用于增加代理模型数据，从而实现更具信息的采样。",
