    "translated_abstract": "我们使用虚假信息检测作为案例研究，检查了在将机器学习应用于信任与安全问题上学术和实践之间的脱节。我们对该领域中270篇广受引用的论文进行了自动检测虚假信息的文献系统化，并对子集中的论文进行了数据和代码的可用性、设计失误、可复现性和泛化性等方面的研究。我们发现文献中存在严重的不足之处，这对所声称的性能和实用性提出了质疑。检测任务通常与在线服务真正面临的挑战有本质上的区别。数据集和模型评估通常不代表现实世界的情景，而且评估往往不独立于模型训练。数据和代码的可用性很差。模型在领域外的数据上泛化能力不强。基于这些结果，我们提出了评估机器学习应用于信任与安全问题的建议。",
