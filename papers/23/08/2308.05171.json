    "translated_abstract": "斯坦解决理论于Wald (1950)首次使用状态相关均值损失（风险）来衡量统计决策函数在潜在样本中的性能。我们认为评估性能应该考虑随机支配，但我们没有找到一个令人信服的理由只关注均值损失。我们认为使用其他遵守随机支配的函数来衡量性能也很有启发性，比如损失分布的分位数。本文发展了关于统计决策理论关注随机支配的一般原则和示例应用。我们将Wald的可采纳性定义修改为类似的随机支配（SD）可采纳性概念，该概念使用随机支配而不是均值抽样性能来比较备选决策规则。我们研究了在治疗选择中出现的两个相对简单的决策问题中的SD可采纳性。我们重新评估了这些关系。",
