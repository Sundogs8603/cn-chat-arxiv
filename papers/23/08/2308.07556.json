    "abstract": "We present an evaluation of text simplification (TS) in Spanish for a production system, by means of two corpora focused in both complex-sentence and complex-word identification. We compare the most prevalent Spanish-specific readability scores with neural networks, and show that the latter are consistently better at predicting user preferences regarding TS. As part of our analysis, we find that multilingual models underperform against equivalent Spanish-only models on the same task, yet all models focus too often on spurious statistical features, such as sentence length. We release the corpora in our evaluation to the broader community with the hopes of pushing forward the state-of-the-art in Spanish natural language processing.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们通过两个语料库，一个针对复杂句子和一个针对复杂词语的识别，对西班牙文文本简化进行了一个生产系统的评估。我们将最流行的西班牙特定可读性评分与神经网络进行了比较，并表明后者在预测用户对文本简化的偏好方面始终更好。作为我们分析的一部分，我们发现多语言模型在相同任务上表现不如仅限于西班牙文的模型，但所有模型过于频繁地关注统计特征，如句子长度。我们将我们评估中的语料库发布给更广泛的社区，希望推动西班牙语自然语言处理的最新技术。",
