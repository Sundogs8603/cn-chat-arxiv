    "abstract": "Recommendation systems aim to provide users with relevant suggestions, but often lack interpretability and fail to capture higher-level semantic relationships between user behaviors and profiles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to construct personalized reasoning graphs. These graphs link a user's profile and behavioral sequences through causal and logical inferences, representing the user's interests in an interpretable way. Our approach, LLM reasoning graphs (LLMRG), has four components: chained graph reasoning, divergent extension, self-verification and scoring, and knowledge base self-improvement. The resulting reasoning graph is encoded using graph neural networks, which serves as additional input to improve conventional recommender systems, without requiring extra user or item information. Our approach demonstrates how LLMs can enable more logical and interpretable recommender systems through personalized reasoning graphs. LL",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统旨在为用户提供相关建议，但通常缺乏可解释性，并且无法捕捉用户行为和个人资料之间的更高级语义关系。本文提出了一种新颖的方法，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建个性化推理图。这些图通过因果和逻辑推理将用户的个人资料和行为序列链接起来，以可解释的方式表示用户的兴趣。我们的方法，LLM推理图（LLMRG），包括四个组件：链接图推理、发散扩展、自我验证与评分，以及知识库自我改进。最终得到的推理图被编码为图神经网络，作为额外的输入来改进传统的推荐系统，而无需额外的用户或项目信息。我们的方法展示了LLMs如何通过个性化推理图实现更具逻辑性和可解释性的推荐系统。",
