    "translated_abstract": "数据标记成本常常限制了机器学习系统的性能。在多任务学习中，相关任务之间相互提供信息并提高整体性能，但是标签成本可能在不同任务之间变化。在不同任务中如何分配标签预算（即在标记上投入的金额）以实现最佳的多任务性能? 我们首次提出并正式定义了多任务学习中的标签预算分配问题，并实证表明不同的预算分配策略对其性能有很大影响。我们提出一种任务自适应预算分配算法，以鲁棒地生成适应不同多任务学习设置的最佳预算分配。具体来说，我们通过估计和最大化分配预算所获得的新信息的程度作为多任务学习性能的代理。在PASCAL VOC和Taskonomy上的实验表明了我们方法的有效性。",
