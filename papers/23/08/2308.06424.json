    "abstract": "A hypothesis class admits a sample compression scheme, if for every sample labeled by a hypothesis from the class, it is possible to retain only a small subsample, using which the labels on the entire sample can be inferred. The size of the compression scheme is an upper bound on the size of the subsample produced. Every learnable binary hypothesis class (which must necessarily have finite VC dimension) admits a sample compression scheme of size only a finite function of its VC dimension, independent of the sample size. For multiclass hypothesis classes, the analog of VC dimension is the DS dimension. We show that the analogous statement pertaining to sample compression is not true for multiclass hypothesis classes: every learnable multiclass hypothesis class, which must necessarily have finite DS dimension, does not admit a sample compression scheme of size only a finite function of its DS dimension.",

    "translated_abstract": "如果一个假设类能够通过只保留一个小的子样本推断出整个样本的标签，那么它就具有样本压缩方案。学习二元假设类（必须具有有限的VC维度）都可以通过VC维度的一个有限函数大小的样本压缩方案实现。然而，对于多类别假设类来说，DS维度是相对应的，我们发现学习多类别假设类（必须具有有限的DS维度）并不能通过一个DS维度的有限函数大小的样本压缩方案实现。",
