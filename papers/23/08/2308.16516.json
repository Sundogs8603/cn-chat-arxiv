    "translated_abstract": "过度压缩和过度平滑是限制图神经网络（GNN）能力的两个关键问题。过度平滑消除了节点之间的差异，使它们难以区分，而过度压缩指的是GNN无法在较长的距离上传播信息，因为指数级的节点状态被压缩成固定大小的表示。这两种现象具有类似的原因，都在很大程度上是由图拓扑引起的。为了解决这些问题，在图分类任务中，我们提出了一种新颖的汇聚方法CurvPool。CurvPool利用图的曲率概念自适应地识别负责过度平滑和过度压缩的结构。通过基于平衡Forman曲率对节点进行聚类，CurvPool构建了一个具有更合适结构的图，允许深层模型和远距离信息的结合。我们将其与其他最先进的汇聚方法进行比较，并确定其竞争力。",
