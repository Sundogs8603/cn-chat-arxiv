    "translated_abstract": "人脸防伪（FAS）对于保护人脸识别系统至关重要。然而，现有的基于手工制作的二进制或像素级标签的FAS方法由于各种展示攻击（PA）的限制存在局限性。在本文中，我们提出了一种在光闪光下攻击类型鲁棒的人脸防伪框架，称为ATR-FAS。由于各种攻击类型导致的图像差异，基于单一二进制分类网络的传统FAS方法可能导致欺骗人脸的过度类内距离，从而导致决策边界学习的挑战。因此，我们采用多个网络来重建多帧深度图作为辅助监督，并且每个网络专注于一种攻击类型。引入了由类型门和帧注意力门组成的双门模块（DGM），分别用于攻击类型识别和多帧注意力生成。DGM的输出被用作加权混合多个专家网络的结果。",
