    "abstract": "Identifying safe areas is a key point to guarantee trust for systems that are based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). To this end, we introduce the AllDNN-Verification problem: given a safety property and a DNN, enumerate the set of all the regions of the property input domain which are safe, i.e., where the property does hold. Due to the #P-hardness of the problem, we propose an efficient approximation method called epsilon-ProVe. Our approach exploits a controllable underestimation of the output reachable sets obtained via statistical prediction of tolerance limits, and can provide a tight (with provable probabilistic guarantees) lower estimate of the safe areas. Our empirical evaluation on different standard benchmarks shows the scalability and effectiveness of our method, offering valuable insights for this new type of verification of DNNs.",

    "translated_abstract": "识别安全区域是保证基于深度神经网络（DNNs）系统的信任的关键点。为此，我们引入了AllDNN-Verification问题：给定一个安全属性和一个DNN，枚举属性输入域的所有安全区域，即属性成立的区域。由于问题的#P难度，我们提出了一种高效的近似方法叫做epsilon-ProVe。我们的方法通过统计预测容限限制获得可控低估的输出可达集，并能够提供一个具有可证明概率保证的安全区域的紧密下估计。我们在不同的标准基准测试上进行的实证评估显示了我们方法的可扩展性和有效性，为这种新型的DNN验证提供了有价值的见解。",
