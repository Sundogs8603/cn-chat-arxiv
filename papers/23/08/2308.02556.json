    "abstract": "We present a text mining system to support the exploration of large volumes of text detailing the findings of government inquiries. Despite their historical significance and potential societal impact, key findings of inquiries are often hidden within lengthy documents and remain inaccessible to the general public. We transform the findings of the Irish government's inquiry into industrial schools and through the use of word embedding, text classification and visualisation, present an interactive web-based platform that enables the exploration of the text to uncover new historical insights.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个文本挖掘系统，以支持探索大量关于政府调查发现的文本。尽管这些调查具有历史意义和潜在的社会影响，但关键发现常常隐藏在冗长的文件中，对一般公众来说无法获取。我们通过使用词嵌入、文本分类和可视化技术，将爱尔兰政府对工业学校的调查结果进行转化，呈现出一个交互式的基于网络的平台，可以探索文本以揭示新的历史洞见。",
