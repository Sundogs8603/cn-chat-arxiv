    "abstract": "Recent advancements in numerical simulation methods based on physical models have enhanced the accuracy of weather forecasts.

While statistical machine learning has also significantly advanced, its direct application is difficult to utilize physics knowledge. This paper proposes a method that employs machine learning to ``interpolate'' future weather in mountainous regions using current observed data and forecast data from surrounding plains. Generally, weather prediction relies on numerical simulations, so this approach can be considered a hybrid method that indirectly merges numerical simulation and machine learning.

    "translated_abstract": "最近基于物理模型的数值模拟方法的进展提高了天气预报的准确性。然而，在复杂地形如山地地区，由于数值模拟中使用了几公里平方的网格，精度会降低。虽然统计机器学习也取得了显著进展，但直接应用难以利用物理知识。本文提出了一种方法，利用当前观测数据和周围平原的预报数据，使用机器学习来“插值”未来山区的天气。通常，天气预测依赖于数值模拟，因此这种方法可以被视为间接融合数值模拟和机器学习的混合方法。还研究了在降水预测中使用二元交叉熵的方法。",
