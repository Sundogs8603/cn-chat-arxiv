    "abstract": "With the continuous increase of users and items, conventional recommender systems trained on static datasets can hardly adapt to changing environments. The high-throughput data requires the model to be updated in a timely manner for capturing the user interest dynamics, which leads to the emergence of streaming recommender systems. Due to the prevalence of deep learning-based recommender systems, the embedding layer is widely adopted to represent the characteristics of users, items, and other features in low-dimensional vectors. However, it has been proved that setting an identical and static embedding size is sub-optimal in terms of recommendation performance and memory cost, especially for streaming recommendations. To tackle this problem, we first rethink the streaming model update process and model the dynamic embedding size search as a bandit problem. Then, we analyze and quantify the factors that influence the optimal embedding sizes from the statistics perspective. Based on this",

    "translated_abstract": "随着用户和物品数量的不断增加，传统的静态数据集上训练的推荐系统很难适应不断变化的环境。高吞吐量的数据要求模型及时更新以捕捉用户兴趣动态，这导致了流式推荐系统的出现。由于基于深度学习的推荐系统的普及，嵌入层广泛采用以低维向量表示用户、物品和其他特征的特性。然而，已经证明设置相同和静态的嵌入尺寸在推荐性能和内存成本方面是次优的，特别是对于流式推荐。为解决这个问题，我们首先重新思考了流式模型更新过程，并将动态嵌入尺寸搜索建模为一个强盗问题。然后，我们从统计学角度分析和量化影响最佳嵌入尺寸的因素。",
