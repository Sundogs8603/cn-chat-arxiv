    "abstract": "Foundation models are increasingly attracting interest worldwide for their distinguished capabilities and potential to perform a wide variety of tasks. Nevertheless, people are concerned about whether foundation model based AI systems are properly governed to ensure trustworthiness of foundation model based AI systems and to prevent misuse that could harm humans, society and the environment. In this paper, we identify eight governance challenges in the entire lifecycle of foundation model based AI systems regarding the three fundamental dimensions of governance: decision rights, incentives, and accountability. Furthermore, we explore the potential of blockchain as a solution to address the challenges by providing a distributed ledger to facilitate decentralised governance. We present an architecture that demonstrates how blockchain can be leveraged to realise governance in foundation model based AI systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "基金会模型因其卓越的能力和潜力在全球范围内越来越受到关注，能够执行各种任务。然而，人们担心基于基金会模型的人工智能系统是否得到了适当的治理，以确保其可信度，并防止可能对人类、社会和环境造成伤害的滥用。在本文中，我们确定了基金会模型人工智能系统在整个生命周期中面临的八个治理挑战，涉及治理的三个基本维度：决策权、激励机制和问责制。此外，我们探讨了区块链作为解决这些挑战的潜力，通过提供分布式账本来促进去中心化的治理。我们提出了一个架构，演示了如何利用区块链实现基金会模型人工智能系统的治理。",
