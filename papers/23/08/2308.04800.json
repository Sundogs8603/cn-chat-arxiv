However, most existing approaches primarily focus on enhancing the model's effectiveness on individual benchmark datasets, disregarding the high costs of adapting the system to disparate datasets in real-world scenarios (e.g., multi-tenant platform). Therefore, we present ADMUS, a progressive knowledge base question answering framework designed to accommodate a wide variety of datasets, including multiple languages, diverse backbone knowledge bases, and disparate question answering datasets. To accomplish the purpose, we decouple the architecture of conventional KBQA systems and propose this dataset-independent framework. Our framework supports the seamless integration of new datasets with minimal effort, only requiring creating a dataset-related micro-service at a negligible cost. To enhance the usability of",

    "translated_abstract": "随着深度学习模型的引入，基于语义解析的知识库问答系统在处理复杂问题方面取得了高性能。然而，大多数现有方法主要关注于提高模型在各个基准数据集上的效果，忽视了在现实场景中（例如多租户平台）将系统适应不同数据集的高成本。因此，我们提出了ADMUS，一种适应多种数据集的渐进式知识库问答框架，包括多种语言，不同的知识库和不同的问答数据集。为了实现这个目的，我们解耦常规知识库问答系统的架构，并提出了这种与数据集无关的框架。我们的框架支持无缝集成新的数据集，只需要以极小的成本创建一个与数据集相关的微服务。",
