    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个研究大纲，旨在探究在工业机器人的背景下的群体动力学和同侪压力。我们的研究计划的动机是工业机器人已经成为人机共同工作的一个不可或缺的部分。然而，工业机器人在机器人可信度、群体动力学以及潜在用户跟随机器人指示的倾向方面的研究中还很少被整合。因此，我们的目标是将经典的Asch实验（参见\\cite{Asch_51}）将其转化为在工业机器人中进行的HRI实验。具体来说，我们将测试参与者在面对一个群体（相对于个体）的工业机器人手臂（相对于人类）同伴给出错误回应时，对机器人回应的遵循程度。我们对工业机器人背景下的群体规模、被感知的机器人可信度、心理压力和同侪压力的影响感兴趣。通过这项研究的结果，我们希望揭示可能支撑HRI的群体动力学。",
