    "translated_abstract": "尽管端到端可训练的自动语音识别（ASR）通过联合学习声学和语言信息取得了巨大成功，但仍然受到领域转变的影响，限制了潜在的应用。端到端ASR模型隐式学习了内部语言模型（LM），该模型表征了源领域的训练分布，而端到端训练的性质使得内部LM很难适应只有文本数据的目标领域。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了基于注意力编码-解码器（Decoupled-AED）和神经传输器（Decoupled-Transducer）模型的解耦结构，可以在离线和在线场景中实现灵活的领域自适应，同时保持稳健的领域内性能。为此，端到端模型解码器（或预测网络）的声学和语言部分进行解耦，使得语言组成部分（即内部LM）可以替代。当遇到领域转变时，",
