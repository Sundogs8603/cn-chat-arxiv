    "translated_abstract": "旅行商问题（TSP）是文献中研究较多的NP-hard问题之一。最先进的近似TSP求解器是Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun（LKH）启发式算法和Edge Assembly交叉算法（EAX）。最近的研究表明，带有重启机制的EAX在广泛的TSP实例中表现优秀。然而，这项研究仅限于涉及2000个城市的问题。我们研究了从2000到85900个城市的问题。我们发现求解器的性能因问题类型而异。然而，将这些求解器结合在一起，以集合的方式使用，我们能够超越单独求解器的性能。我们认为集合式设置是利用丰富的计算资源的有效方式。除了EAX和LKH，我们还使用了EAX和混合遗传算法（MGA）的多个版本的混合算法。MGA和EAX的混合已经被证明可以解决一些困难的问题。我们发现混合版本的集合胜过了最先进的求解器。",
