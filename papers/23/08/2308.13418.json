    "abstract": "Scientific knowledge is predominantly stored in books and scientific journals, often in the form of PDFs. However, the PDF format leads to a loss of semantic information, particularly for mathematical expressions. We propose Nougat (Neural Optical Understanding for Academic Documents), a Visual Transformer model that performs an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task for processing scientific documents into a markup language, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a new dataset of scientific documents. The proposed approach offers a promising solution to enhance the accessibility of scientific knowledge in the digital age, by bridging the gap between human-readable documents and machine-readable text. We release the models and code to accelerate future work on scientific text recognition.",

    "translated_abstract": "科学知识主要存储在图书和科学期刊中，通常以PDF格式存在。然而，PDF格式会导致语义信息的丢失，尤其是数学表达式。我们提出了Nougat（用于学术文档的神经光学理解），一种利用视觉转换模型进行光学字符识别（OCR）任务，将科学文档处理成标记语言，并在新数据集上展示了我们模型的有效性。这种方法为在数字时代增强科学知识的可访问性提供了有希望的解决方案，弥合了人类可读文档和机器可读文本之间的差距。我们发布了模型和代码，以加速未来科学文本识别工作的进行。",
