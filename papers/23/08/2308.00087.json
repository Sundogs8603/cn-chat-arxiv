Therefore, we focus on the recently investigated S&P500 mean market correlation in a period of roughly 20 years that includes the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis and the Euro crisis. The analysis is performed two-fold: first, in retrospect on the whole dataset and second, in an on-line adaptive manner in pre-crisis segments. The on-line sensitivity horizon is roughly determined to be 80 up to 100 trading days after a crisis onset. A detailed comparison to global economic events supports the interpretation of the mean market correlation as an informative macroeconomic measure by a rathe",

    "translated_abstract": "确定导致经济剧变的宏观经济事件对于理解整体经济动力非常重要。我们介绍了一个开源的高效 Python 实现的贝叶斯多趋势变点分析，解决了从相关性度量中提取危机信息的显著内存和计算时间限制问题。因此，我们关注近20年的S&P500平均市场相关性，包括互联网泡沫、全球金融危机和欧元危机。该分析分为两个部分：首先，回顾整个数据集，然后，在危机前的分段中以在线自适应方式进行。在线敏感性时间范围大致确定为危机发生后约80到100个交易日。与全球经济事件的详细比较支持将平均市场相关性解释为一种信息丰富的宏观经济度量。",
