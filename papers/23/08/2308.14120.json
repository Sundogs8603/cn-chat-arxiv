    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）开发者（如数据科学家）和从业者（如临床医生）之间存在知识差距，阻碍了ML在临床数据分析中的充分利用。我们研究了chatGPT Advanced Data Analysis（ADA），即GPT-4的扩展，来弥合这一差距并高效执行ML分析的潜力。我们向chatGPT ADA提供了各种医学专业的大型试验的真实临床数据和研究详细信息，没有给出具体指导。ChatGPT ADA基于原始研究的训练数据自主开发了最先进的ML模型，用于预测临床结果，如癌症发展、癌症进展、疾病并发症或致病基因序列等生物标志物。令人惊讶的是，这些ML模型与其已发表的对应物相匹配甚至表现更好。我们得出结论，chatGPT ADA为民主化医学中的ML提供了一个有前景的途径，使非ML专家能够获得先进的分析工具并推动广泛应用。",
