    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶车辆必须能够感知周围环境并预测其他交通参与者的未来行为。现有的方法要么进行目标检测，然后对检测到的目标进行轨迹预测，要么预测整个场景的密集占用和流格。前者由于效率原因需要保持检测数量较少，从而牺牲了对象的回忆率，存在安全问题。后者由于输出格的高维性和完全卷积网络固有的有限感受野而计算成本高。此外，这两种方法都使用了大量的计算资源来预测可能永远不会被运动规划器查询的区域或对象。鉴于这一点，我们提出了一种统一的感知和未来预测方法，利用单个神经网络隐式表示随时间变化的占用和流动。我们的方法避免了不必要的计算，因为它可以直接被运动规划器查询。",
