    "translated_abstract": "文本图（TGs）是指节点对应文本（句子或文档）的图形，在许多领域都得到广泛应用。TGs的表示学习包括两个阶段：（i）无监督特征提取和（ii）监督图表示学习。近年来，人们在后者阶段进行了大量的研究，其中图神经网络（GNNs）占据主导地位。然而，目前大多数现有图形基准的前者阶段仍依赖于传统的特征工程技术。最近随着语言模型（LMs）的快速发展，研究人员开始利用LMs来促进TGs的学习，方法要么是在计算密集的框架中联合训练它们（合并两个阶段），要么是设计复杂的自监督训练任务来进行特征提取（增强第一阶段）。在这项工作中，我们提出了SimTeG，一种令人沮丧地简单的文本图学习方法，它不创新于框架、模型和任务。",
