    "abstract": "The rapid growth in the usage and applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in various sociotechnical solutions has highlighted the need for a comprehensive understanding of bias and its impact on society. While research on bias in NLP has expanded, several challenges persist that require attention. These include the limited focus on sociodemographic biases beyond race and gender, the narrow scope of analysis predominantly centered on models, and the technocentric implementation approaches. This paper addresses these challenges and advocates for a more interdisciplinary approach to understanding bias in NLP. The work is structured into three facets, each exploring a specific aspect of bias in NLP.",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理（NLP）在各种社会技术解决方案中的使用和应用的迅速增长，突显了对偏见及其对社会的影响的全面理解的需求。虽然关于NLP中偏见的研究已经扩大，但仍然存在一些需要注意的挑战。这些挑战包括在种族和性别之外对社会人口偏见的有限关注，主要集中在模型上的狭窄分析范围以及技术中心的实施方法。本文正是解决这些挑战并倡导更多的跨学科方法来理解NLP中的偏见。该工作分为三个方面，分别探索NLP中特定方面的偏见。",
