    "translated_abstract": "时空图神经网络在交通预测方面取得了最先进的性能。然而，由于传统损失函数的局限性，它们往往难以准确预测拥堵情况。准确预测常规交通条件至关重要，但可靠的人工智能系统还必须准确预测拥堵情景，以维持安全和高效的交通。在本文中，我们探讨了受重尾分析和不平衡分类问题启发的各种损失函数，以解决这个问题。我们在交通速度预测方面评估了这些损失函数的有效性，重点关注拥堵情况。通过对真实交通数据集进行广泛实验，我们发现在优化平均绝对误差（MAE）时，MAE-Focal Loss函数表现最为有效。在优化均方误差（MSE）时，Gumbel Loss被证明是更优的选择。这些选择可以有效地预测交通拥堵。",
