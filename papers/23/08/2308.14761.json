    "abstract": "Text-to-image models suffer from various safety issues that may limit their suitability for deployment. Previous methods have separately addressed individual issues of bias, copyright, and offensive content in text-to-image models. However, in the real world, all of these issues appear simultaneously in the same model. We present a method that tackles all issues with a single approach. Our method, Unified Concept Editing (UCE), edits the model without training using a closed-form solution, and scales seamlessly to concurrent edits on text-conditional diffusion models. We demonstrate scalable simultaneous debiasing, style erasure, and content moderation by editing text-to-image projections, and we present extensive experiments demonstrating improved efficacy and scalability over prior work.

    "translated_abstract": "文本到图像模型存在各种安全问题，可能限制其适用性。先前的方法分别解决了文本到图像模型中的偏见、版权和冒犯性内容等各个问题。然而，在真实世界中，所有这些问题都同时出现在同一个模型中。我们提出了一种使用单一方法解决所有问题的方法，名为统一概念编辑（UCE）。我们的方法在不经过训练的情况下通过闭合解决方案对模型进行编辑，并可无缝地扩展到文本条件下的扩散模型上进行并行编辑。我们通过编辑文本到图像的投影来展示可扩展的同时去偏见、消除风格和内容调节，我们进行了大量实验证明了相对于先前方法的改进效果和可扩展性。我们的代码可以在https://unified.baulab.info上找到。",
