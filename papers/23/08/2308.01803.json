    "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of the Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, it is timely to study the economy created by such blockchain. In this chapter, we will survey recent progress on the trading and wealth evolution in a cryptocurrency where the new coins are issued according to the PoS protocol. We first consider the wealth evolution in the PoS protocol assuming no trading, and focus on the problem of decentralisation. Next we consider each miner's trading incentive and strategy through the lens of optimal control, where the miner needs to trade off PoS mining and trading. Finally, we study the collective behavior of the miners in a PoS trading environment by a mean field model. We use both stochastic and analytic tools in our study. A list of open problems are also presented.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着Proof of Stake（PoS）区块链的越来越广泛采用，研究这种区块链创造的经济是及时的。在本章中，我们将调查依据PoS协议发行新币的加密货币中的交易和财富演化的最新进展。我们首先考虑在没有交易的情况下PoS协议的财富演化，并关注去中心化的问题。接下来，我们通过最优控制的视角考虑每个矿工的交易激励和策略，矿工需要权衡PoS挖矿和交易。最后，我们通过均场模型研究在PoS交易环境中矿工的集体行为。在我们的研究中使用了随机和分析工具。同时还提出了一系列未解决的问题。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了Proof of Stake（PoS）协议中的交易和财富演化。通过分析 PoS 协议中没有交易的情况下的财富演化、考虑矿工的交易激励和策略，以及研究 PoS 交易环境中矿工的集体行为，总结了该协议的经济特征。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the trading and wealth evolution in the Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol. By analyzing the wealth evolution in the absence of trading, considering the trading incentive and strategy of miners, and studying the collective behavior of miners in a PoS trading environment, the economic characteristics of this protocol are summarized."
