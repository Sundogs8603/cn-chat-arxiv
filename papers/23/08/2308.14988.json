    "translated_abstract": "网络数据在许多大数据应用中非常常见，包括经济和健康网络，了解网络的潜在结构非常重要。本文使用度校正混合成员模型(DCMM)来建模网络。在DCMM模型中，对于每个节点$i$，存在一个成员向量$\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_ i = (\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_i(1), \\boldsymbol{\\pi}_i(2),\\ldots, \\boldsymbol{\\pi}_i(K))$，其中$\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_i(k)$表示节点$i$在社区$k$中的权重。我们推导了关于$\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_i(k)$的新颖的有限样本扩展，从而使我们能够获得成员混合概率和其他相关总体数量的渐近分布和置信区间。这填补了关于成员配置的不确定性量化方面的重要空白。我们进一步基于特定社区中的成员混合概率开发了一个顶点排名方案，并进行相关统计推断。",
