    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了OmniDataComposer，一种创新的多模态数据融合和无限数据生成方法，旨在改善和简化不同数据模态之间的相互作用。最核心的突破是引入了一种有效处理和合并多模态数据输入的协调数据结构，包括视频、音频和文本。我们设计的算法利用了视频/图像字幕提取、密集字幕提取、自动语音识别（ASR）、光学字符识别（OCR）、Recognize Anything Model（RAM）和物体跟踪等多种操作的进展。OmniDataComposer能够识别超过6400种对象类别，显著扩大了视觉信息的范围。它将这些多样的模态融合在一起，促进模态之间的相互增强，并促进跨模态数据校正。最终输出将每个视频输入转化为详细的顺序文档。",
