    "translated_abstract": "尽管基础产业的经济重要性很高，但其生产链中的一些组件，如加热炉，能耗较高。通过减少加热炉中的整体加热时间，可以显著降低能耗。在基础产业可持续制造中，计算机集成的机器学习（ML）和人工智能（AI）控制系统可能是实现“零净排放”目标的关键。本文中，由于在加热炉等场景中无法获得高质量的数据的可行性，采用经典的Hottel区域方法基于计算模型生成数据，用于ML和深度学习（DL）模型的回归训练。值得注意的是，区域方法提供了一种优雅的方式来建模辐射传热（RHT）的物理现象，这是加热炉内高温过程中占主导地位的传热机制。利用这些数据，进行了详细的实验研究。",
