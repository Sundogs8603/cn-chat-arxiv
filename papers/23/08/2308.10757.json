    "abstract": "arXiv:2308.10757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Communicating shapes our social word. For a robot to be considered social and being consequently integrated in our social environment it is fundamental to understand some of the dynamics that rule human-human communication. In this work, we tackle the problem of Addressee Estimation, the ability to understand an utterance's addressee, by interpreting and exploiting non-verbal bodily cues from the speaker. We do so by implementing an hybrid deep learning model composed of convolutional layers and LSTM cells taking as input images portraying the face of the speaker and 2D vectors of the speaker's body posture. Our implementation choices were guided by the aim to develop a model that could be deployed on social robots and be efficient in ecological scenarios. We demonstrate that our model is able to solve the Addressee Estimation problem in terms of addressee localisation in space, from a robot ego-centric point of view.",

    "translated_abstract": "交流塑造了我们的社交世界。为了让机器人被视为社交的，并被纳入我们的社交环境中，理解驱使人际交流的一些动态是至关重要的。在这项工作中，我们解决了定位对象的问题，即理解话语的对象，通过解释和利用说话者的非语言身体信号。我们通过实现一个混合深度学习模型来做到这一点，该模型由卷积层和LSTM单元组成，以描绘说话者脸部的图像和说话者身体姿势的2D向量作为输入。我们的实现选择是为了开发一个在社交机器人上可以部署并能在生态场景中高效的模型。我们展示了我们的模型能够从机器人的自我中心观点解决定位对象的问题。",
