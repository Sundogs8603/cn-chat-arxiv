    "translated_abstract": "在面对干扰时，准确的在线瞬态稳定性预测对于确保电力系统的稳定至关重要。传统的瞬态稳定性分析依赖于时间域仿真，不能快速适应电力网格拓扑的变化。为了将高维电力系统拓扑结构信息向量化为低维节点嵌入流数据，提出了基于图嵌入动态特征（GEDF）的瞬态稳定性GEDF-监督对比学习（GEDF-SCL）模型。该模型利用监督对比学习结合GEDF来预测瞬态稳定性，考虑了电力系统的拓扑信息。为了评估所提出的GEDF-SCL模型的性能，基于IEEE 39节点系统模型生成了拓扑结构不同的电力网格。通过在这些生成的电力系统拓扑上模拟N-1和N-$\\bm{m}$-1故障，获取了瞬态运行数据。测试结果表明GEDF-SCL模型具有良好的瞬态稳定性预测性能。",
