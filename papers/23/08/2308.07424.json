    "abstract": "Distribution shift in machine learning models can be a primary cause of performance degradation. This paper delves into the characteristics of these shifts, primarily motivated by Real-Time Bidding (RTB) market models. We emphasize the challenges posed by class imbalance and sample selection bias, both potent instigators of distribution shifts. This paper introduces the Exponential Tilt Reweighting Alignment (ExTRA) algorithm, as proposed by Marty et al. (2023), to address distribution shifts in data. The ExTRA method is designed to determine the importance weights on the source data, aiming to minimize the KL divergence between the weighted source and target datasets. A notable advantage of this method is its ability to operate using labeled source data and unlabeled target data. Through simulated real-world data, we investigate the nature of distribution shift and evaluate the applicacy of the proposed model.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型中的分布偏移可能是性能下降的主要原因。本文深入探讨了这些偏移的特性，主要针对实时竞价（RTB）市场模型的特点。我们强调了类别不平衡和样本选择偏差所带来的挑战，这两者均是分布偏移的强有力诱因。本文介绍了一种名为ExTRA（Exponential Tilt Reweighting Alignment）的算法，该算法由Marty等人（2023）提出，用于解决数据中的分布偏移问题。ExTRA方法旨在确定源数据上的重要性权重，以最小化加权源数据和目标数据集之间的KL散度。该方法的一个显著优点是它能够使用有标签的源数据和无标签的目标数据进行操作。通过模拟真实世界数据，我们研究了分布偏移的性质，并评估了所提出模型的适用性。",
