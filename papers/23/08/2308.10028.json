    "translated_abstract": "促销券滥用检测是电子商务中重要的异常检测问题。虽然出现了许多基于图神经网络的解决方案，但监督式范式取决于大量标记数据。一个常见的替代方案是采用自监督预训练使用无标签数据，并在有限标签的下游任务上进一步微调。然而，“预训练，微调”范式常常受到预训练和下游任务之间目标差距的困扰。因此，我们提出了VPGNN，一种基于GNN的提示式微调框架用于促销券滥用检测。我们设计了一个新颖的图提示函数，将下游任务重构成与预训练中的预文本任务类似的模板，从而缩小了目标差距。在专有和公共数据集上进行的大量实验证明了VPGNN在少样本和半监督情况下的优势。此外，在生产环境中在线部署VPGNN显示出23.4%的性能改进。",
