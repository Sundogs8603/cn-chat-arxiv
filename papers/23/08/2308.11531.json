    "translated_abstract": "我们的项目旨在通过数据驱动的智能来帮助和支持难民地位审理的相关利益相关者，如律师、法官、管理机构和申请人，以便更好地做出决策，并增加难民申请流程的理解和透明度。这个博士项目有两个主要目标：（1）检索过去的案例，（2）在加拿大案例数据集上分析法律决策流程。在本文中，我们介绍了我们工作的当前状态，包括对（1）部分的完成试验和与（2）部分相关的持续努力。我们相信基于自然语言处理的解决方案很适合应对这些挑战，并研究了自动化所涉及的所有步骤的可行性。此外，我们介绍了未来难民法自然语言处理研究的新基准。我们的方法旨在包容所有最终用户和利益相关者，并带来预期的好处，包括减少决策时间，更公平地决策过程。",
