    "translated_abstract": "在向以人为中心的人工智能转变的最近，机器准确使用自然语言的需求变得越来越重要。虽然实现这一目标的常见方法是训练大型语言模型，但这种方法可能存在学习错位，模型可能无法捕捉人类在使用自然语言时所使用的基本结构和推理方式，可能导致意想不到或不可靠的行为。紧急沟通（Emecom）是一个近年来发表的研究领域，旨在开发能够以超越简单的判别性任务，并能有效地交流和学习新概念的自然语言使用能力的人工代理。在本综述中，我们以两个方面介绍Emecom。首先，我们界定了文献中发现的所有常见特性及其与人类交互的关系。其次，我们确定了两个子类别，并突出它们的特点和开放挑战。",
