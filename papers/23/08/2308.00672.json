    "abstract": "This paper examines various methods of computing uncertainty and diversity for active learning in genetic programming. We found that the model population in genetic programming can be exploited to select informative training data points by using a model ensemble combined with an uncertainty metric. We explored several uncertainty metrics and found that differential entropy performed the best. We also compared two data diversity metrics and found that correlation as a diversity metric performs better than minimum Euclidean distance, although there are some drawbacks that prevent correlation from being used on all problems. Finally, we combined uncertainty and diversity using a Pareto optimization approach to allow both to be considered in a balanced way to guide the selection of informative and unique data points for training.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了遗传编程中计算不确定性和多样性的各种方法。我们发现，通过使用模型合集结合不确定性度量，可以利用遗传编程中的模型群体选择信息丰富的训练数据点。我们探索了几种不确定性度量，并发现微分熵表现最好。我们还比较了两种数据多样性度量，并发现作为多样性度量的相关性比最小欧氏距离表现更好，尽管相关性具有一些缺点，不能在所有问题上使用。最后，我们使用帕累托优化方法将不确定性和多样性结合起来，以平衡地指导选择信息丰富且独特的数据点进行训练。",
