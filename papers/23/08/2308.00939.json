    "translated_abstract": "类别文本生成受到了相当大的关注，因为它对于各种自然语言处理任务都有益处。最近，生成对抗网络（GAN）在文本生成方面取得了有希望的性能，这归功于其对抗训练过程。然而，文本GAN存在一些问题，包括离散性、训练不稳定、模式崩溃、缺乏多样性和可控性等等。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新颖的GAN框架，即特征感知的条件生成对抗网络（FA-GAN），用于可控的类别文本生成。在FA-GAN中，生成器具有序列到序列的结构，用于提高句子多样性，它包括三个编码器，包括一个特征感知编码器和一个类别感知编码器，以及一个基于关系记忆核的解码器，使用Gumbel SoftMax激活函数。鉴别器还具有额外的类别分类头。为了生成指定类别的句子，",
