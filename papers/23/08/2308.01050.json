    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶车辆（AVs）有潜力提供诸多社会效益，如减少道路事故和提高交通效率。然而，由于缺乏历史数据和技术的快速发展，量化AVs的风险是具有挑战性的。本文提出了一个基于数据驱动的框架，用于比较不同AVs在各种操作设计领域（ODDs）中行为的风险，该框架基于对“不良”道路用户进行反事实模拟。我们引入了反事实安全边界的概念，表示可能导致碰撞的最小偏离正常行为的量。该概念有助于找到最关键的情景，同时也有助于评估AVs的风险频率和严重程度。我们证明，即使AV的行为策略是未知的，提出的方法仍然适用于最坏和最佳情况分析，使该方法对外部第三方风险评估机构也有用。",
