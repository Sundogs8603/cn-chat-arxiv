    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation is one of the most important tasks in recommender systems, which aims to recommend the next interacted item with historical behaviors as input. Traditional sequential recommendation always mainly considers the collected positive feedback such as click, purchase, etc. However, in short-video platforms such as TikTok, video viewing behavior may not always represent positive feedback. Specifically, the videos are played automatically, and users passively receive the recommended videos. In this new scenario, users passively express negative feedback by skipping over videos they do not like, which provides valuable information about their preferences. Different from the negative feedback studied in traditional recommender systems, this passive-negative feedback can reflect users' interests and serve as an important supervision signal in extracting users' preferences. Therefore, it is essential to carefully design and utilize it in this novel recommendation scenario",

    "translated_abstract": "顺序推荐是推荐系统中最重要的任务之一，其目标是根据历史行为推荐下一个交互项。传统的顺序推荐主要考虑了诸如点击、购买等收集到的正反馈。然而，在TikTok等短视频平台上，视频浏览行为并不总是代表正反馈。具体来说，这些视频是自动播放的，用户被动地接收推荐的视频。在这种新场景下，用户通过跳过他们不喜欢的视频来表达被动负反馈，这提供了有关他们喜好的有价值的信息。与传统推荐系统中研究的负反馈不同，这种被动负反馈可以反映用户的兴趣，并作为抽取用户偏好的重要监督信号。因此，在这一全新的推荐场景中，仔细设计和利用被动负反馈至关重要。",
