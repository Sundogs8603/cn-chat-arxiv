    "translated_abstract": "随着技术的进步，艺术和人工智能（AI）的未来充满希望。随着AI在设计中的应用日益普及，艺术实践可能不再只是人类的艺术形式，而可能成为一种数字化整合的体验。通过增强创造力和合作，艺术和AI可以共同努力创造出视觉上吸引人并满足艺术家和观众需求的艺术作品。虽然人们不确定整合将会达到何种程度，但艺术和AI很可能会相互影响。本研讨会图文并茂地提出了一项第一人称研究，分享了一个人机交互研究员与AI互动的经历，试图摆脱创造性阻碍。这篇图文论文探讨了两个问题：AI如何支持艺术家的创造力，以及这种情境下的可解释性意味着什么？研究员与ChatGPT和Midjourney进行了互动，结果产生了一系列需要在XAIxArts社区进一步讨论和探索的思考。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a first-person narrative of an HCI researcher interacting with AI in an attempt to overcome creative block. By exploring how AI can support artistic creativity and the meaning of explainability in this context, the study provides food for thought and further discussion in the XAIxArts community."
