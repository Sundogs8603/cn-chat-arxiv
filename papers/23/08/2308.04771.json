    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种使用典型分析（SUnAA）的新型稀疏解混技术。首先，我们基于典型分析设计了一个新模型。我们假设感兴趣的成分是来自光谱库提供的成分的凸组合，并且感兴趣的成分数量是已知的。然后，我们提出了一个最小化问题。与大多数传统稀疏解混方法不同，这里的最小化问题是非凸的。我们使用主动集算法迭代地最小化优化目标。我们的方法对初始化鲁棒，并且只需要感兴趣的成分数量。使用两个模拟数据集评估了SUnAA，结果证实了其在信号重建误差方面相比其他常规和先进技术的更好性能。SUnAA还应用于Cuprite数据集，并将结果与该数据集提供的地质图进行了视觉比较。定性评估表明了它的有效性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a new sparse unmixing technique called SUnAA, which utilizes archetypal analysis. By designing a new model and using an active set algorithm to iteratively minimize the optimization objective, SUnAA achieves accurate unmixing of mixed endmembers. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance in terms of signal-to-reconstruction error compared to other methods."
