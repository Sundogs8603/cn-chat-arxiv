    "abstract": "The fairness issue of clinical data modeling, especially on Electronic Health Records (EHRs), is of utmost importance due to EHR's complex latent structure and potential selection bias. It is frequently necessary to mitigate health disparity while keeping the model's overall accuracy in practice. However, traditional methods often encounter the trade-off between accuracy and fairness, as they fail to capture the underlying factors beyond observed data. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel model called Fair Longitudinal Medical Deconfounder (FLMD) that aims to achieve both fairness and accuracy in longitudinal Electronic Health Records (EHR) modeling. Drawing inspiration from the deconfounder theory, FLMD employs a two-stage training process. In the first stage, FLMD captures unobserved confounders for each encounter, which effectively represents underlying medical factors beyond observed EHR, such as patient genotypes and lifestyle habits. This unobserved confounder is crucial ",

    "translated_abstract": "临床数据建模的公平性问题，尤其是在电子健康记录（EHRs）上，由于EHR的复杂潜在结构和潜在选择偏差问题而至关重要。在实践中，通常需要在保持模型整体准确性的同时减少健康差异。然而，传统方法往往在准确性和公平性之间存在权衡，因为它们无法捕捉到观察数据之外的潜在因素。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一个名为公平纵向医疗去混淆器（FLMD）的新模型，旨在实现纵向电子健康记录（EHR）的公平性和准确性建模。受到去混淆器理论的启发，FLMD采用了一个两阶段的训练过程。在第一阶段，FLMD捕捉了每次接触的未观察到的混淆因子，这有效地表示了超出观察到的EHR之外的潜在医疗因素，如患者基因型和生活习惯。这个未观察到的混淆因子是至关重要的。",
