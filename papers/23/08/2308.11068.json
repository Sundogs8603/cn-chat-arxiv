    "translated_abstract": "最近出现的拓扑深度学习（TDL）方法旨在通过自然地处理高阶交互，超越由图表示定义的成对关系和局部邻域，从而扩展当前的图神经网络（GNN）。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于TDL的图信号压缩方法，包括两个主要步骤：首先，基于原始信号推断出不相交的高阶结构，通过将N个数据点聚类成K个集合；然后，基于拓扑启示的消息传递在这些多元素集合中获得信号的压缩表示。我们的结果表明，我们的框架在压缩来自两个真实的互联网服务提供商网络数据集的时间链路信号时，比标准的GNN和前馈架构具有更好的重建误差——在所有评估场景中，重建误差提高了从30%到90%。这表明它更好地捕捉和利用了空间和时间特征。",
