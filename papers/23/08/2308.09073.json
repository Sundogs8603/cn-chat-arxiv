While prior efforts mainly focus on data-driven transfer methods, a significant aspect that has not been fully explored is aligning both semantic and token-level representations across diverse languages. In this paper, we propose Multi-view Contrastive Learning for Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (mCL-NER). Specifically, we reframe the CrossNER task into a problem of recognizing relationships between pairs of tokens. This approach taps into the inherent contextual nuances of token-to-token connections within entities, allowing us to align representations across different languages. A multi-view contrastive learning framework is introduced to encompass semantic contrasts between source, codeswitched, and target sentences, as well as contrasts among toke",

    "translated_abstract": "跨语言命名实体识别面临着由于跨语料库稀缺，尤其是对非英语数据表现不均的挑战。本文提出了一种通过多视角对比学习实现跨语言命名实体识别（mCL-NER）的方法。具体而言，我们将CrossNER任务重新构建为一种识别令牌对关系的问题，该方法利用实体内部令牌之间的上下文细微差别，使我们能够将不同语言的表示统一起来。引入了一种多视角对比学习框架，用于涵盖源语句、代码切换语句和目标语句之间的语义对比，以及令牌之间的对比。",
