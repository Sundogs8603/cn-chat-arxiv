    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了利用生成式AI模型（如ChatGPT）进行投资组合选择的潜在用途。由于模型的“幻觉”，对来自生成预训练转换器（GPT）模型的投资建议的信任是一个挑战，需要对输出进行仔细验证和验证。因此，我们采用了一种替代方法。我们使用ChatGPT从S&P500市场指数中获取一组有投资吸引力的股票。随后，我们将利用这个由AI生成的交易股票组合与定量组合优化模型进行比较，并与一些流行的投资基金进行对比评估。我们的研究结果表明，ChatGPT在股票选择方面是有效的，但在分配股票组合中的最优权重方面可能表现不佳。但是，当ChatGPT的股票选择与已建立的组合优化模型相结合时，我们取得了更好的结果。",
