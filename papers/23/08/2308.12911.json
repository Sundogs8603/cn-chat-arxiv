    "translated_abstract": "多模态感知推荐系统(MRSs)利用多模态内容（例如产品图片或描述）作为项目的附加信息，以提高推荐准确性。虽然大多数这样的方法都依赖于分解模型（例如MFBPR）作为基础架构，但已经证明MFBPR可能受到流行偏差的影响，即它本质上倾向于提升流行（即短头）目录中的项目推荐，而对长尾（即小众）目录中的项目推荐不利。在这项工作中，我们首次提供了关于多模态推荐如何进一步放大流行偏差的分析。具体而言，我们评估了四种最先进的MRSs算法（即VBPR、MMGCN、GRCN、LATTICE）在Amazon的三个数据集上的性能，评估推荐准确度指标的同时，还考虑了推荐项目的多样性和检索到的小众项目的比例等性能度量。为了更好地研究这一点……",
