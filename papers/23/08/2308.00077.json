    "translated_abstract": "网络入侵检测系统（NIDS）是保护网络空间免受各种安全风险和未知网络攻击的重要工具。已经实施了许多基于机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）的NIDS解决方案。然而，所有这些解决方案都容易受到对抗性攻击的影响，恶意行为者通过向系统中注入对抗扰动样本来试图回避或欺骗模型。本研究的主要目标是研究强大的对抗攻击算法及其对DL-based NIDS的防御方法。快速梯度符号方法（FGSM），Jacobian显著性图攻击（JSMA），投影梯度下降（PGD）和Carlini＆Wagner（C＆W）是四种对NIDS实施的强大对抗攻击方法。作为防御方法，采用对抗训练来增强NIDS模型的稳健性。结果可以总结为三个阶段，即1）对抗攻击前，2）对抗攻击后，3）对抗攻击后。",
