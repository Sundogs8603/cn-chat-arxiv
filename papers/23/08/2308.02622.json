    "translated_abstract": "可持续发展目标（SDGs）是联合国提出的旨在鼓励有助于保障人类繁荣和可持续性的政策和活动。在金融行业中，为了评估一个公司与每个17个可持续发展目标的一致性，设计了SDG框架提供分数。这种评分能够对潜在建立包容和可持续经济的投资进行一致的评估。由于此类框架需要高质量和可靠性，创建和维护它们的过程耗时且需要广泛的领域专业知识。在这项工作中，我们描述了一个数据驱动的系统，旨在自动化创建SDG框架的过程。首先，我们提出了一种从不同网络来源和与一组公司相关的知识图谱收集和过滤文本数据集的新方法。然后，我们使用此数据训练和部署了分类器来预测分数。",
