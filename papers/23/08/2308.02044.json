It highlights how digitality has compelled scholars to redefine Archive and History field and has facilitated the accessibility of analogue sources through digitization and integration into big data. The study focuses on two AI systems, namely Transkribus and ChatGPT, which enable efficient analysis and transcription of digitized sources. The article presents a test of ChatGPT, which was utilized to normalize the text of 366 letters stored in the Correspondence section of the Biscari Archive (Catania). Although the AI exhibited some limitations that resulted in inaccuracies, the corrected texts met expectations.
