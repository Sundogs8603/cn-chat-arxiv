    "translated_abstract": "算法公平性度量通常在二元决策的背景下进行讨论。我们将这种方法扩展到连续评分。到目前为止，基于ROC的度量方法主要用于此目的。其他现有方法主要依赖于评分的分布，不适用于排名任务，或者它们的效果大小不可解释。在这里，我们提出了一种基于Wasserstein距离的连续评分的分布不变公平性度量方法，具有合理的解释。我们的度量方法易于计算，并适用于量化和解释群体差异的强度，以及比较不同模型、数据集或时间点之间的偏差。我们建立了现有评分公平性度量方法的不同族之间的联系，并表明所提出的分布不变公平性度量方法表现更好，因为它们更明确，并且可以量化显著的偏差，而ROC-based不能。",
