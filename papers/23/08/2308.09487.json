    "translated_abstract": "为了成功发动后门攻击，注入的数据需要被正确标记，否则，即使是基本的数据过滤器也能轻易检测出来。因此，引入了无标签攻击的概念，这种攻击更加危险，因为它不需要改变注入数据的标签。据我们所知，现有的无标签后门攻击在很大程度上依赖于对整个训练集或其中一部分的理解。然而，在实践中，攻击者很难拥有这些理解，因为训练数据集通常来自多个独立的来源。与所有当前的无标签攻击不同，我们提出了一种新颖的无标签方法，名为“毒箭蛙”。毒箭蛙不需要访问任何训练数据，只需要了解攻击目标类别，比如“蛙”。在CIFAR10、Tiny-ImageNet和TSRD上，仅需要分别占训练集大小的0.1%、0.025%和0.4%的中毒率，毒箭蛙就能取得成功。",
