    "abstract": "The application of the Large Language Model (LLM) to robot action planning has been actively studied. The instructions given to the LLM by natural language may include ambiguity and lack of information depending on the task context. It is possible to adjust the output of LLM by making the instruction input more detailed; however, the design cost is high. In this paper, we propose the interactive robot action planning method that allows the LLM to analyze and gather missing information by asking questions to humans. The method can minimize the design cost of generating precise robot instructions. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our method through concrete examples in cooking tasks. However, our experiments also revealed challenges in robot action planning with LLM, such as asking unimportant questions and assuming crucial information without asking. Shedding light on these issues provides valuable insights for future research on utilizing LLM for robotics.",

    "translated_abstract": "将大型语言模型（LLM）应用于机器人行动规划已经被积极研究。通过自然语言给出的LLM指令可能存在歧义和缺乏信息，这取决于任务环境。可以通过使指令输入更详细来调整LLM的输出；然而，设计成本很高。在本文中，我们提出了一种交互式机器人行动规划方法，允许LLM通过向人类提问来分析并收集缺失信息。该方法可以最大程度地减少生成精确机器人指令的设计成本。我们通过烹饪任务的具体示例证明了我们方法的有效性。然而，我们的实验也揭示了LLM在机器人行动规划中面临的挑战，如提出不重要的问题和在不询问的情况下假设关键信息。对这些问题的阐明为未来利用LLM进行机器人技术研究提供了有价值的见解。",
