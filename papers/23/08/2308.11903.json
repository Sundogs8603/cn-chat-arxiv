    "abstract": "Studies on semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) have seen fast progress recently. Due to the limited labelled data, SSMIS methods mainly focus on effectively leveraging unlabeled data to enhance the segmentation performance. However, despite their promising performance, current state-of-the-art methods often prioritize integrating complex techniques and loss terms rather than addressing the core challenges of semi-supervised scenarios directly. We argue that the key to SSMIS lies in generating substantial and appropriate prediction disagreement on unlabeled data. To this end, we emphasize the crutiality of data perturbation and model stabilization in semi-supervised segmentation, and propose a simple yet effective approach to boost SSMIS performance significantly, dubbed DPMS. Specifically, we first revisit SSMIS from three distinct perspectives: the data, the model, and the loss, and conduct a comprehensive study of corresponding strategies to examine their effectiveness",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，半监督医学图像分割（SSMIS）的研究取得了快速进展。由于有限的标记数据，SSMIS方法主要关注如何有效利用未标记数据来提高分割性能。然而，尽管当前最先进的方法表现出色，但它们往往优先考虑集成复杂技术和损失项，而不是直接解决半监督场景的核心挑战。我们认为，SSMIS的关键在于在未标记数据上生成充分且合适的预测差异。为此，我们强调了在半监督分割中数据扰动和模型稳定化的重要性，并提出了一种简单而有效的方法来显著提高SSMIS性能，称为DPMS。具体而言，我们首先从数据、模型和损失三个不同角度重新审视了SSMIS，并对相应策略进行了全面研究以检验其有效性。",
