    "translated_abstract": "分层学习（SL）作为一种在不公开数据所有者的原始数据样本的情况下进行模型训练的有前景的方法而出现。然而，传统的SL不可避免地泄漏了标签隐私，因为尾部模型（具有最后几层）应该放在服务器上。为了克服这一限制，一种有前景的解决方法是利用U型架构将早期层和最后层都放在用户端。在本文中，我们开发了一种新颖的并行U型分层学习方法，并设计了优化资源分配方案以提高边缘网络的性能。在所提出的框架中，多个用户与边缘服务器进行SL通信。我们分析了训练过程中每个客户端的端到端延迟，并设计了一种高效的资源分配算法，称为LSCRA，它可以找到最佳的计算资源分配和分层。我们的实验结果表明了LSCRA的有效性，以及U型PSL可以达到与其他S方法类似的性能。",
