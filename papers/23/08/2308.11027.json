    "translated_abstract": "深度学习在医疗预测任务中展现出了巨大的潜力，然而在不同医疗机构之间实现泛化的深度学习模型仍然具有挑战性。这部分是由于这些机构的孤立性质和患者隐私要求所致。为了解决这个问题，我们展示了如何利用拆分学习来实现深度学习模型的协作训练，跨越不同的、私有维护的健康数据集，同时保护原始记录和模型参数的隐私。我们引入了一种新的隐私保护分布式学习框架，相比传统的联邦学习，它提供了更高的隐私保护水平。我们使用了多个生物医学影像和电子健康记录 (EHR) 数据集，证明了通过拆分学习训练的深度学习模型能够达到与中央和联邦学习模型相似的性能，同时极大地提高了计算效率。",
