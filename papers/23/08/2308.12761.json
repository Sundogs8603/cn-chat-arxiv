    "translated_abstract": "CNN已广泛应用于医学图像分析。然而，有限的内存容量是处理高分辨率3D体积数据的常见缺点之一。通常在处理之前需要对3D体积进行裁剪或缩小，这可能导致分辨率降低，增加类别不平衡，并影响分割算法的性能。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为IP-UNet的端到端深度学习方法。IP-UNet是一种基于UNet的模型，它对3D体积数据的强度投影（IP）进行多类别分割，而不是占用大量内存的3D体积。IP-UNet利用有限的内存能力进行训练，同时保留了原始的3D图像分辨率。我们通过分割准确性和计算成本比较了三种模型的性能：1）使用传统的2D UNet模型对CT扫描图像进行逐层2D分割。2）使用IP-UNet对提取的最大强度投影进行数据融合处理。",
