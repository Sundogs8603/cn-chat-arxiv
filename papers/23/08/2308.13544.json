    "translated_abstract": "摘要。虽然基于位置的增强现实（AR）在教育中的使用已经证明对参与者的动机、参与度和身体活动有益处，但地理定位数据的不准确性导致增强对象抖动或漂移，这是降低用户体验的一个因素。我们开发了一个免费开源的网络AR应用，并进行了一项比较用户测试（n = 54），以评估地理定位数据对可用性、探索和关注的影响。控制组使用了系统与内嵌的GNSS数据结合，探索自然界的生物多样性，实验组使用了外部模块进行RTK数据。在测试过程中，记录了眼动数据、地理定位轨迹和应用内用户触发的事件。参与者回答了可用性问卷（SUS、UEQ、HARUS）。我们发现，实验组暴露的RTK组地理定位数据的平均准确性低于控制组。实验组报告的可用性得分较低。",
