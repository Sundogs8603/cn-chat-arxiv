    "abstract": "Cell segmentation is a critical step for quantitative single-cell analysis in microscopy images. Existing cell segmentation methods are often tailored to specific modalities or require manual interventions to specify hyperparameters in different experimental settings. Here, we present a multi-modality cell segmentation benchmark, comprising over 1500 labeled images derived from more than 50 diverse biological experiments. The top participants developed a Transformer-based deep-learning algorithm that not only exceeds existing methods, but can also be applied to diverse microscopy images across imaging platforms and tissue types without manual parameter adjustments. This benchmark and the improved algorithm offer promising avenues for more accurate and versatile cell analysis in microscopy imaging.",

    "translated_abstract": "细胞分割是显微镜图像中进行定量单细胞分析的关键步骤。现有的细胞分割方法通常针对特定模态或需要手动干预来指定不同实验设置中的超参数。在这里，我们提出了一个多模态细胞分割基准，包括来自50多个不同生物实验的1500多个标记图像。前几名参与者开发了一种基于Transformer的深度学习算法，不仅超过了现有的方法，而且还可以应用于不同显微成像平台和组织类型的多样显微镜图像，无需手动参数调整。这个基准和改进的算法为显微成像中更准确和多功能的细胞分析提供了有希望的途径。",
