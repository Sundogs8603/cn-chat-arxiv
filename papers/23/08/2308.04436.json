    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence is bringing ever new functionalities to the realm of mobile devices that are now considered essential (e.g., camera and voice assistants, recommender systems). Yet, operating artificial intelligence takes up a substantial amount of energy. However, artificial intelligence is also being used to enable more energy-efficient solutions for mobile systems. Hence, artificial intelligence has two faces in that regard, it is both a key enabler of desired (efficient) mobile functionalities and a major power draw on these devices, playing a part in both the solution and the problem. In this paper, we present a review of the literature of the past decade on the usage of artificial intelligence within the realm of green mobile computing. From the analysis of 34 papers, we highlight the emerging patterns and map the field into 13 main topics that are summarized in details.  Our results showcase that the field is slowly increasing in the past years, more specifically, since 2",

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能为移动设备带来了越来越多的功能，如相机和语音助手、推荐系统等，被认为是不可或缺的。然而，运行人工智能需要消耗大量能源。然而，人工智能也被用于实现更节能的移动系统解决方案。因此，从这个角度来看，人工智能有两个面向，它既是实现理想（高效）移动功能的关键，也是这些设备的主要能源消耗者，既是问题的一部分，也是解决方案的一部分。在本文中，我们对过去十年在绿色移动计算领域使用人工智能的文献进行了综述。通过分析34篇论文，我们总结出13个主要主题，并展示了该领域近年来的发展情况。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文综述了在绿色移动计算领域使用人工智能的研究，并指出人工智能在移动设备中既是关键的功能实现者，又是能源消耗的主要来源。"
