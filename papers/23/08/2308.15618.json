    "en_tdlr": "RACR-MIL is an automated weakly-supervised skin cancer grading method that can be trained using whole slide images without fine-grained tumor annotations. It uses attention-based multiple-instance learning on tiled patches to assign a grade to the whole slide image. Key innovations include defining a graph representation of the slide image to capture local and non-local dependencies between tumor regions and introducing an ordinal ranking constraint on the attention network."
