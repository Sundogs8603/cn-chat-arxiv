The concept of well-separatedness used here is derived directly from the common definition of clusters, which imposes an interplay between the requirements of within-cluster-homogenicity and between-clusters-diversity. Conditions are derived for a special case of well-separated clusters such that the global minimum of $k$-means cost function coincides with the well-separatedness. An experimental investigation is performed to find out whether or no various brands of $k$-means are actually capable of discovering well separated clusters. It turns out that they are not. A new algorithm is proposed that is a variation of $k$-means++ via repeated {sub}sampling when choosing a seed. The new algorithm outperforms four other algorithms from $k$-means family on the task.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了各种品牌的K-Means算法在正确恢复互相分离的聚类时的能力。在这里所使用的互相分离的概念直接源自对聚类常见定义的推导，这个定义强调了在簇内同质性和簇间差异性之间的平衡。推导出了一种特殊情况下，具有互相分离性的聚类表现成了K-Means代价函数的全局最小值。通过实验调查发现各种品牌的K-Means算法实际上不能正确地发现互相分离的聚类。我们提出了一种新算法，它是K-Means++的变体，通过重复子采样来选择种子。这个新算法在任务中胜过了K-Means家族中的其他四个算法。",
