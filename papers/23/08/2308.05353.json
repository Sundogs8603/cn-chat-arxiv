    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种名为PreAttacK的新算法，用于检测社交网络中的伪造账号。最近，一些算法在这个问题上取得了很高的准确率。然而，它们所依赖的信息是关于伪造账号的友谊关系或其与他人分享的内容，而这正是我们想要防止的。PreAttacK与这些方法有着显著的不同。我们首次提供了关于新的伪造（和真实）账号在加入主要网络（Facebook）后尝试请求朋友的详细分布分析。我们表明，即使在新账号没有交朋友或分享内容之前，这些初始朋友请求行为会引发社交网络增长的经典偏好连接模型的自然多类扩展。我们利用这个模型推导出一个新的算法PreAttacK。我们证明，在相关问题实例中，PreAttacK能够近似最优地解决问题。",
