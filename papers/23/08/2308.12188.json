    "translated_abstract": "肺癌是全球致死的重要原因，强调早期发现对提高生存率的重要性。本研究提出了一个基于机器学习(ML)的工具，使用PLCO癌症筛查试验数据进行训练，并在NLST上进行验证，以估计五年内发生肺癌的可能性。该研究利用了两个数据集，PLCO (n=55,161)和NLST (n=48,595)，其中包含有关肺癌风险因素、临床测量和结局的全面信息。数据预处理包括删除不是目前或曾经吸烟者以及死于与肺癌无关原因的患者。此外，重点放在减轻被截断数据引起的偏差上。特征选择、超参数优化和模型校准使用XGBoost进行，该算法结合了梯度提升和决策树的集成学习算法。ML模型在预处理的PLCO数据集上进行训练。",
