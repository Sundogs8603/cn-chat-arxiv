    "abstract": "As AI technology advances rapidly, concerns over the risks of bigness in digital markets are also growing. The EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) aims to address these risks. Still, the current framework may not adequately cover generative AI systems that could become gateways for AI-based services. This paper argues for integrating certain AI software as core platform services and classifying certain developers as gatekeepers under the DMA. We also propose an assessment of gatekeeper obligations to ensure they cover generative AI services. As the EU considers generative AI-specific rules and possible DMA amendments, this paper provides insights towards diversity and openness in generative AI services.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能技术的快速发展，对数字市场巨头风险的关注也日益增加。欧盟的数字市场法案旨在解决这些风险。然而，目前的框架可能未能充分覆盖可能成为AI服务入口的生成式AI系统。本文主张将某些AI软件整合为核心平台服务，并将某些开发者分类为数字市场法案的守门人。我们还提议对守门人义务进行评估，以确保它们涵盖生成式AI服务。随着欧盟考虑生成式AI特定规则和可能的数字市场法案修正案，本文为生成式AI服务的多样化和开放性提供了见解。",
    "tldr": "这项研究旨在探讨如何应对生成式AI中的巨头风险，并提出了将某些AI软件作为核心平台服务，将某些开发者分类为守门人，并对相关义务进行评估的建议。这有助于欧盟在生成式AI服务中维护多样性和开放性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This research seeks to address the risks of bigness specifically in generative AI, proposing the integration of certain AI software as core platform services and the classification of certain developers as gatekeepers, accompanied by an assessment of their obligations. This contributes to maintaining diversity and openness in generative AI services within the EU."
