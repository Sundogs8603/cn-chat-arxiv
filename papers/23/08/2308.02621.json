    "abstract": "To improve the accuracy of color image completion with missing entries, we present a recovery method based on generalized higher-order scalars. We extend the traditional second-order matrix model to a more comprehensive higher-order matrix equivalent, called the \"t-matrix\" model, which incorporates a pixel neighborhood expansion strategy to characterize the local pixel constraints. This \"t-matrix\" model is then used to extend some commonly used matrix and tensor completion algorithms to their higher-order versions. We perform extensive experiments on various algorithms using simulated data and algorithms on simulated data and publicly available images and compare their performance. The results show that our generalized matrix completion model and the corresponding algorithm compare favorably with their lower-order tensor and conventional matrix counterparts.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了提高有缺失条目的彩色图像补全的准确性，我们提出了一种基于广义高阶标量的恢复方法。我们将传统的二阶矩阵模型扩展为更全面的高阶矩阵等效模型，称为“t-矩阵”模型，该模型结合了像素邻域扩展策略来表征局部像素约束。然后，我们使用这个“t-矩阵”模型将一些常用的矩阵和张量补全算法扩展到它们的高阶版本。我们对使用模拟数据和公开可用的图像的各种算法进行了广泛的实验，并比较了它们的性能。结果表明，我们的广义矩阵补全模型和相应的算法与它们的低阶张量和传统矩阵对应物相比具有很好的性能。",
