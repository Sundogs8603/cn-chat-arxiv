    "translated_abstract": "心血管疾病的高发率需要便捷且经济有效的连续心脏监测工具。尽管心电图（ECG）是黄金标准，但连续监测仍然是一个挑战，因此人们开始探索光电容容积脉搏图（PPG），这是一种更基本的可用于消费者可穿戴设备的替代方案。这种想法最近引起了将PPG转化为ECG信号的兴趣。在这项工作中，我们引入了区域解耦扩散模型（RDDM），这是一种设计用于捕捉ECG复杂时间动态的新颖扩散模型。传统的扩散模型如去噪扩散概率模型（DDPM）在捕捉这种细微差别时面临困难，因为整个信号上的噪声添加过程是不加选择的。我们提出的RDDM通过将噪声有选择地添加到感兴趣区域（ROI）（如ECG信号中的QRS复合体）的新颖正向过程和反向过程来克服此类限制。",
