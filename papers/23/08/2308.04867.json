    "translated_title": "学习通用型符号规划的动作",
    "translated_abstract": "符号规划是一种强大的技术，用于解决需要长序列动作并装备智能体具有复杂行为的复杂任务。这种方法的缺点是需要合适的符号表示来描述环境的状态以及能够改变状态的动作。传统上，这些表示是由专家为不同的问题域精心设计的，这限制了它们在不同问题和环境复杂性上的可转移性。在这篇论文中，我们提出了一种新的概念，使用给定的实体层次结构和观察到的相似行为来通用化符号动作。在一个模拟的基于网格的厨房环境中，我们展示了从少量观察中学习到的通用型动作能够泛化到新的情况。在规划过程中引入额外的即时通用化机制，可以处理未见过的任务组合、较长序列、新实体和意外环境行为。",
