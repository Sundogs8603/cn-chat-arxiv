    "translated_abstract": "目前在细胞识别任务上，监督深度学习模型的成功依赖于详细的注释。许多先前的研究已经成功减少了对标签的依赖性。然而，考虑到一个补丁中包含的大量细胞，昂贵而低效的标注仍然不可避免。为此，我们探索了无标签方法来进行细胞识别。我们提出了先验自激活图（PSM）来生成伪掩膜作为训练目标。具体而言，我们使用自监督学习来训练一个激活网络。网络的浅层中的梯度信息被聚合以生成先验自激活图。然后，我们引入了一个语义聚类模块作为管道，将PSMs转换为像素级语义伪掩膜，以供下游任务使用。我们在两个组织学数据集MoNuSeg（细胞分割）和BCData（多类别细胞检测）上评估了我们的方法。与其他全监督和弱监督方法相比，我们的方法表现更好。",
