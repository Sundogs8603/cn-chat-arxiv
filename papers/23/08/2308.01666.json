Here we compare the ability of a large language model (ChatGPT) and a previously developed regular expression (RegexT) to identify overweight body condition scores (BCS) in veterinary narratives. Methods: BCS values were extracted from 4,415 anonymised clinical narratives using either RegexT or by appending the narrative to a prompt sent to ChatGPT coercing the model to return the BCS information. Data were manually reviewed for comparison. Results: The precision of RegexT was higher (100%, 95% CI 94.81-100%) than the ChatGPT (89.3%; 95% CI82.75-93.64%). However, the recall of ChatGPT (100%. 95% CI 96.18-100%) was considerably higher than that of RegexT (72.6%, 95% CI 63.92-79.94%).

    "translated_abstract": "背景：兽医临床叙述仍然是一个很少被利用的资源，用于应对复杂疾病。在这里，我们比较了一个大型语言模型(ChatGPT)和之前开发的正则表达式(RegexT)在识别兽医叙述中超重体况评分(BCS)方面的能力。方法：使用RegexT或将叙述附加到发送给ChatGPT的提示中来提取4,415个匿名临床叙述中的BCS值，迫使模型返回BCS信息。通过手动审查数据进行比较。结果：RegexT的精确度(100%，95% CI 94.81-100%)高于ChatGPT的精确度(89.3%，95% CI 82.75-93.64%)。然而，ChatGPT的召回率(100%，95% CI 96.18-100%)要远高于RegexT的召回率(72.6%，95% CI 63.92-79.94%)。局限性：需要对提示工程进行微调以改善ChatGPT输出。结论：大型语言模型为创建各种机会提供了可能性，并且虽然复杂，但具有直观的界面用于in",
