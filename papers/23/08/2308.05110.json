    "translated_abstract": "中风是致死率和致残率显著的因素，需要早期预测策略来降低风险。传统评估患者的方法，如急性生理和慢性健康评估（APACHE II、IV）和简化急性生理评分III（SAPS III），具有有限的准确性和可解释性。本文提出了一种新颖的方法：一种可解释的基于注意力机制的变压器模型，用于早期中风死亡率预测。该模型旨在解决之前预测模型的局限性，提供解释性（清晰、易懂地解释模型）和忠实度（从输入到输出提供真实的模型动态解释）。此外，研究还探索和比较使用Shapley值和基于注意力的评分来改进模型的可解释性和忠实度分数。研究目标包括设计一种可解释的基于注意力机制的变压器模型，评估其性能。",
