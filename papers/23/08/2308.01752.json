    "abstract": "Intelligent systems have become a major part of our lives. Human responsibility for outcomes becomes unclear in the interaction with these systems, as parts of information acquisition, decision-making, and action implementation may be carried out jointly by humans and systems. Determining human causal responsibility with intelligent systems is particularly important in events that end with adverse outcomes. We developed three measures of retrospective human causal responsibility when using intelligent systems. The first measure concerns repetitive human interactions with a system. Using information theory, it quantifies the average human's unique contribution to the outcomes of past events. The second and third measures concern human causal responsibility in a single past interaction with an intelligent system. They quantify, respectively, the unique human contribution in forming the information used for decision-making and the reasonability of the actions that the human carried out. T",

    "translated_abstract": "智能系统已成为我们生活中的重要组成部分。在与这些系统的互动中，人类对结果的责任变得模糊，因为信息获取、决策和行动实施的部分可能由人类和系统共同完成。在导致不利结果的事件中，确定人类因果责任尤为重要。我们提出了三种衡量使用智能系统时的追溯人类因果责任的方法。 第一种方法涉及人类与系统的重复交互。利用信息论，它量化了人类对过去事件结果的平均独特贡献。第二和第三种方法分别涉及人类在与智能系统的单次过去交互中的因果责任。它们分别量化了人类在形成决策所使用的信息方面的独特贡献以及人类实施行动的合理性。",
