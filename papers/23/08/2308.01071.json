    "translated_abstract": "时间序列分类（TSC）在过去二十年中受到了很多关注，并且仍然是数据科学和知识工程中的一个关键且具有挑战性的问题。随着时间序列数据的不断增加，研究界在文献中提出了许多TSC算法。除了基于相似性度量、区间、形状特征、字典、深度学习方法或者混合集成方法的最先进方法外，近年来还设计了一些用于从时间序列中提取无监督信息摘要统计特征的工具。这些工具最初设计用于时间序列的描述性分析和可视化，具有信息丰富且可解释的特征，但很少有这些特征工程工具在TSC问题上进行了基准测试，并与最先进的TSC算法在预测性能方面进行了比较。在本文中，我们旨在填补这一空白，并提出了一个简单的TSC过程来评估这些工具在预测性能方面与最先进的TSC算法的比较。",
