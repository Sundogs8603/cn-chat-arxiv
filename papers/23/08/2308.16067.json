Such events are sparse (once in a lifetime), many victims will not have had prior investigations for cardiac disease and many different definitions of sudden death exist.

This analysis used NHS Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for people aged $\\geq$50 years living in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GG\\&C) region in 2010 (n = 380,000) to try to overcome these challenges. We investigated whether medical history, blood tests, prescription of medicines, and hospitalisations might, in combination, predict a heightened risk of sudden death.  We compared the performance of models trained to predict either sudden death or all-cause mortality. We built six models for each outcome of interest: three taken from state-of-the-art research (BEHRT, Deepr and Deep Patient), and three of our own creation. We trained t",

    "translated_abstract": "全球每年有数百万人突然和意外死亡，无论是否有心血管疾病的先前历史。这种事件很少见，许多受害者在心脏疾病之前没有接受过调查，而突发死亡的定义也存在许多不同。因此，突发死亡很难预测。本分析使用了2010年大格拉斯哥和克莱德（GG＆C）地区50岁及以上的人群的英国国民保健服务电子健康记录（EHR）（n = 380,000）来尝试克服这些挑战。我们调查了医疗史、血液检查、药物处方和住院治疗是否相结合可以预测突发死亡的风险增加。我们比较了训练用于预测突发死亡或全因死亡的模型的性能。我们为每个感兴趣的结果构建了六个模型：三个取自最新研究（BEHRT，Deepr和Deep Patient），三个为我们自己创建。我们进行了训练",
