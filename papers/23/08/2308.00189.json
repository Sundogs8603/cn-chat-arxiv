Despite the ever increasing number of benchmarks that measure task performance, we lack explanations of what behaviors language models exhibit that allow them to complete these tasks in the first place. We argue for a systematic effort to decompose language model behavior into categories that explain cross-task performance, to guide mechanistic explanations and help future-proof analytic research.",

    "translated_abstract": "从预训练模型中引导出期望的行为，同时避免不良行为，重新定义了自然语言处理并正在重新塑造我们与计算机的交互方式。曾经是一个科学工程学科，将构建模块堆叠在一起，现在可以说已经是一个复杂系统科学，其中寻求出现的行为以支持以前无法想象的用例。尽管有越来越多的基准测试来衡量任务性能，但我们缺乏解释语言模型展示这些任务完成的行为的解释。我们提出了一个系统性的努力，将语言模型的行为分解为解释跨任务性能的类别，以指导机械解释并帮助未来分析研究。",
    "tldr": "生成模型作为复杂系统科学，它们能够完成任务的行为表现需要被解释和理解，以实现对其行为的控制和未来研究的指导。"
