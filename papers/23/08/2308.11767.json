    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT正在成为现实。本文展示了如何区分ChatGPT生成的出版物与科学家生成的出版物。通过使用一种新设计的监督机器学习算法，我们演示了如何检测机器生成的出版物和科学家生成的出版物。该算法使用100个真实出版物摘要进行训练，然后采用10倍交叉验证方法建立了一个接受范围的下限和上限。与ChatGPT内容进行比较，明显可见ChatGPT仅贡献了23\\%的二元组内容，这比其他10个交叉验证中的任何一个都少50\\%。这个分析凸显了ChatGPT在技术术语上与真实科学的明显差异。在对每篇文章进行分类时，xFakeBibs算法准确地将98篇出版物识别为假的，有2篇文献错误地分类为真实出版物。尽管这项工作引入了一种算法应用",
