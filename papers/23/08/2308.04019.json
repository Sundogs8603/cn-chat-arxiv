Therefore, this paper studies the OFRS based on three questions: how spatiotemporal features play a role; why self-attention cannot be used to model the spatiotemporal sequences of OFRS; and how to combine spatiotemporal features to improve the efficiency of OFRS.

    "translated_abstract": "在线美食推荐服务（OFRS）具有显著的时空特征，并且具有在及时满足用户需求方面的便利优势。已经进行了许多研究来探索其时空属性，但对OFRS的时空特征进行全面深入的分析尚未进行。因此，本文基于三个问题研究了OFRS：时空特征如何发挥作用；为什么不能使用自注意力来建模OFRS的时空序列；如何结合时空特征以提高OFRS的效率。首先，通过实验分析，我们系统地提取了OFRS的时空特征，确定了最有价值的特征并设计了一种有效的组合方法。其次，我们进行了对时空序列的详细分析，揭示了自注意力在OFRS中的不足之处，并提出了一种更优化的时空建模方法。",
