    "translated_abstract": "在数字时代，理解和定制用户与系统和应用程序的交互体验至关重要。这需要创建将用户配置文件与背景信息相结合的用户背景上下文。然而，对于将背景信息与不同的用户配置文件集成的研究尚缺乏。本研究旨在通过设计一个用户背景上下文的本体论来填补这一空白，该本体论考虑了每个配置文件上的用户配置文件和背景信息。具体而言，我们介绍了一个以汽车销售领域为重点的用户背景上下文本体论的设计和开发。我们设计的本体论作为规范用户配置文件和背景信息表示的结构基础，增强了系统捕捉用户偏好和背景信息的准确性。此外，我们通过使用用户背景上下文本体论进行个性化推荐生成的案例研究进行了说明。",
