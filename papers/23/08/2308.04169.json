    "translated_abstract": "在许多信号处理应用中，元数据可以有利地与高维信号结合使用，以产生所需的输出。在经典的声源定位算法中，将多个分布式麦克风接收到的高维多通道音频信号的信息与描述场景声学特性（如麦克风在空间中的坐标）的信息相结合，以估计声源的位置。我们介绍了双输入神经网络（DI-NNs）作为在神经网络中建模这两种数据类型的简单有效的方法。我们在不同难度和真实性的场景上训练和评估了我们提出的DI-NN，并将其与另一种架构、经典最小二乘（LS）方法以及经典卷积循环神经网络（CRNN）进行了比较。我们的结果表明，DI-NN明显优于基准算法，定位误差比LS方法低五倍。",
