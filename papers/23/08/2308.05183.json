    "translated_abstract": "使用回归分析处理实验数据存在一定困难，因为在构建模型时会涉及到一些假设，如误差分布服从正态分布且变量间相互独立。实际中这些条件并不一定满足，这可能导致构建的经济数学模型没有实际价值。根据作者的观点，作为研究数值序列的替代方法，可以使用费马-托里切利点平滑数值序列，并通过指数序列对这些点进行插值。使用指数序列对数值序列进行插值可以达到与回归分析不相上下的模型构建精确度。同时，通过指数序列进行插值不需要统计材料来证明数值序列的误差服从正态分布，以及变量之间的统计独立性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes using the Fermat-Torricelli point construction method to interpolate the numerical series of inflation in the Czech Republic from 2011 to 2021. By using exponential series for interpolation, it achieves a similar level of accuracy in model construction as regression analysis without the need for assumptions of normal error distribution and statistical independence."
