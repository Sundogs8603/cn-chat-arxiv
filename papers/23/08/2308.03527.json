With the increasing use of chatbots in various domains, e.g., children seeking help with homework, individuals looking for medical advice, and people using the chatbot as a daily source of everyday companionship, the importance of empathy in human-computer interaction has become more apparent. Therefore, our study investigates the extent to which ChatGPT based on GPT-3.5 can exhibit empathetic responses and emotional expressions. We analyzed the following three aspects: (1) understanding and expressing emotions, (2) parallel emotional response, and (3) empathic personality. Thus, we not only evaluate ChatGPT on various empathy aspects and compare it with human behavior but also show a possible way to analyze the empathy of chatbots in general. Our results show, that in 91.7% of the cases, ChatGPT was able to correctly identify emotions and produces appropriate answers. In c",

    "translated_abstract": "共情通常被理解为分享和理解他人的心态或情绪的能力。随着聊天机器人在各个领域的增加应用，例如儿童寻求作业帮助、个人寻求医疗建议以及人们将聊天机器人作为日常伴侣，共情在人机交互中的重要性变得更加明显。因此，我们的研究调查了基于GPT-3.5的ChatGPT在展现共情回应和情感表达方面的能力。我们分析了以下三个方面：(1)理解和表达情感、(2)并行情感回应以及(3)共情个性。因此，我们不仅在各个共情方面评估了ChatGPT并将其与人类行为进行比较，还展示了一种分析聊天机器人共情能力的可能方式。我们的研究结果显示，在91.7%的情况下，ChatGPT能够准确识别情感并产生适当的回答。",
