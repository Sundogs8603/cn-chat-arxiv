    "translated_abstract": "全球石油需求正在迅速增加，预计到2040年将达到每天106.3万桶。因此，对于油气开采行业来说，预测其产量以优化运营并避免损失至关重要。大公司已经意识到利用深度学习(DL)的力量和来自各种油井的大量数据可以节省大量的运营成本并减少不必要的环境影响。在这方面，研究人员提出了使用传统机器学习(ML)技术进行石油产量预测的模型。然而，这些技术对于这个问题是不合适的，因为它们无法捕捉到时间序列数据中的历史模式，导致预测不准确。本研究旨在通过使用序列卷积和长短期记忆(LSTM)单元开发先进的数据驱动回归模型来克服这些问题。进行了详尽的分析以选择最优序列。",
