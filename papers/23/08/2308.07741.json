    "translated_abstract": "在真实机器人上进行实验在时间和成本上要求很高。因此，增强学习（RL）社区的很大一部分使用模拟器来开发和评估算法。然而，从模拟中得到的见解不一定能够转化到真实机器人上，尤其是对于涉及复杂环境交互的任务。因此，Real Robot Challenge 2022作为RL和机器人学界之间的桥梁，让参与者能够像在模拟中一样轻松地远程实验真实机器人。在过去几年中，离线增强学习已经成熟为一种从预先收集的数据集中学习的有希望的范式，减轻了对昂贵在线交互的依赖.因此，我们要求参与者从提供的真实机器人数据集中学习两个灵巧操作任务，包括推动、抓取和手内定位。进行了广泛的软件文档化，并在基于仿真的初步阶段进行了实验。",
