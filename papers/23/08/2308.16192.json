    "abstract": "These lecture notes provide an overview of existing methodologies and recent developments for estimation and inference with high dimensional time series regression models. First, we present main limit theory results for high dimensional dependent data which is relevant to covariance matrix structures as well as to dependent time series sequences. Second, we present main aspects of the asymptotic theory related to time series regression models with many covariates. Third, we discuss various applications of statistical learning methodologies for time series analysis purposes.",
