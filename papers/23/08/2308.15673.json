    "translated_abstract": "使用深度神经网络(DNN)的机器学习模型容易受到后门攻击。攻击者在一小部分输入样本中嵌入一个预定义的干扰物，称为触发器，并训练DNN，使得输入中存在触发器导致输出为攻击者所期望的类别。此类对抗性重训练需要确保没有触发器的输入输出不受影响，并对干净样本提供高分类准确率。本文提出了MDTD，一种针对DNN的多领域木马检测器，用于在测试时检测包含木马触发器的输入。MDTD不需要知道攻击者嵌入触发器的策略，并且可以应用于预训练的DNN模型，包括图像、音频和基于图的输入。MDTD利用了一个洞察力，即包含木马触发器的输入样本相对于干净样本位于决策边界之外较远的位置。MDTD估计了距离。",
