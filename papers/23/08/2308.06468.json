    "translated_abstract": "大多数高级计算机视觉任务依赖于低级图像操作作为其初始过程。诸如边缘检测、图像增强和超分辨率等操作为更高级的图像分析提供了基础。在这项工作中，我们考虑了三个主要目标，即简单性、效率性和泛化性，以解决边缘检测问题，因为当前最先进的边缘检测模型为了提高准确性而变得更加复杂。为了实现这一目标，我们提出了一种名为Tiny and Efficient Edge Detector (TEED)的轻量级卷积神经网络，仅有58K个参数，是当前最先进模型的0.2%。在BIPED数据集上训练仅需不到30分钟，每个epoch耗时不到5分钟。我们提出的模型易于训练，并在最早几个epoch内快速收敛，同时预测的边缘图像清晰且质量较高。此外，我们提出了一个新的数据集来测试边缘检测的泛化能力。",
