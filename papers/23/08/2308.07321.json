Our approach is motivated by the need to provide a method able to evaluate the trade-off between different stakeholders and objectives of hospitals. To the best of our knowledge, no such approach has been considered before in the literature.

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新的医院病例组合规划（CMP）方法。我们的多准则方法利用效用函数（UF）来表达独立决策者关于输出的偏好和立场。本文的主要目的是测试基于上述UF标量化的效用函数方法（UFM）是否是一个合适的定量技术，以实现以下目标：i）将医院资源分配到不同的运营单位；ii）提供更好的容量分配和病例组合。我们的方法源于对评估不同利益相关者和医院目标之间权衡的需求。据我们所知，以前的文献中没有考虑过这种方法。正如我们将在后面展示的，这个想法解决了当前CMP中的各种技术限制、弱点和缺陷。我们对一家大型三级医院的案例研究进行了上述方法的有效性测试。",
