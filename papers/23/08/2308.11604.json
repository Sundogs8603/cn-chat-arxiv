    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的联合源-信道编码在数据重建方面与分离的源-信道编码相比取得了显著的进展。这种优势在于在处理有限块长度数据时，分离的源-信道编码的非最优性。此外，分离的源-信道编码在多用户和/或多分辨率方式下重构数据时表现不佳，因为它只试图满足最差信道和/或最高质量数据。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一个新颖的基于深度学习的多分辨率联合源-信道编码框架，受到多任务学习 (MTL) 的概念启发。该框架通过分层逐渐编码不同分辨率的数据，并通过利用当前和过去的编码数据层来有效解码。此外，该框架在语义通信方面有巨大潜力，其目标不仅仅是数据重建，还包括在整个通信过程中保持特定的语义属性。",
