    "translated_abstract": "扩散MRI通常使用回波平面成像（EPI）进行，因为其采集时间快。然而，扩散加权图像的分辨率常常受到磁场不均匀性相关伪影以及T2和T2*弛豫效应引起的模糊影响。为了解决这些局限，常常采用多次扫描EPI（msEPI）与并行成像技术相结合。然而，由于多个扫描之间的相位变化，重建msEPI可能具有挑战性。在本研究中，我们引入了一种新颖的msEPI重建方法，称为zero-MIRID（零射波自监督学习多次扫描图像重建改进扩散MRI）。该方法通过结合基于深度学习的图像正则化技术来联合重建msEPI数据。该网络在k空间和图像空间中都使用CNN去噪器，并利用虚拟线圈来增强图像重建条件。通过采用自监督学习技术和分割",
