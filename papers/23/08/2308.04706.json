    "translated_abstract": "多媒体推荐涉及个性化排序任务，通常使用通用编码器表示多媒体内容。然而，这些通用表示引入了错误的相关性，无法揭示用户的真实偏好。现有的工作尝试通过学习不变表示来缓解这个问题，但忽视了独立同分布（IID）和非分布（OOD）广义化之间的平衡。本文提出了一个名为Pareto Invariant Representation Learning（PaInvRL）的框架，从IID-OOD多目标优化的角度减少了错误相关性的影响，同时学习不变表示（吸引用户注意的内在因素）和变体表示（其他因素）。具体而言，PaInvRL包括三个迭代执行的模块：（i）非同质识别模块，用于识别反映分布转移",
