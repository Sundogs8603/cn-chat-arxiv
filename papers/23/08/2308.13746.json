    "translated_abstract": "交互式医学图像分割是指通过用户与图像之间的交互（例如，点击）准确地分割出感兴趣的目标。近年来，它得到了广泛研究，因为它不太依赖于大量标注的数据，比完全自动化的分割更加灵活。然而，当前的研究还没有充分探索用户提供的提示信息（例如，点），包括在一个交互中挖掘的知识以及多个交互之间的关系。因此，本文介绍了一种装备有提示增强的新型框架，名为PE-MED，用于交互式医学图像分割。首先，我们引入了一种自循环策略，基于第一个提示生成温暖的初始分割结果。它可以防止出现高度不利的情况，比如在第一次交互后遇到空白遮罩作为初始输入。其次，我们提出了一种新颖的提示注意力学习模块（PALM），用于挖掘有用的提示信息。",
