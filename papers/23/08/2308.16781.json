Medication recommendation, as a sub-domain, aims to amalgamate longitudinal patient history with medical knowledge, assisting physicians in prescribing safer and more accurate medication combinations.

To address this challenge, we introduce StratMed, a model that incorporates an innovative relevance stratification mechanism. It harmonizes discrepancies in data long-tail distribution and strikes a balance between the safety and accuracy of medication combinations.

    "translated_abstract": "随着有限医疗资源与日益增长的需求之间的失衡，基于人工智能的临床任务变得至关重要。作为一个子领域，药物推荐旨在将患者的纵向历史与医学知识相结合，帮助医生更安全、更准确地开具药物组合处方。现有方法忽视了医疗数据中固有的长尾分布，缺乏头尾数据之间的平衡表示，导致模型性能次优。为了解决这个挑战，我们引入了StratMed，这是一个结合了创新的相关性分层机制的模型。它通过协调数据长尾分布中的差异，并在药物组合的安全性和准确性之间取得平衡。具体而言，我们首先使用深度学习网络构建预训练方法来获取实体表示。然后，我们设计了一个类似金字塔的数据分层方法，以获得更通用的实体表示。",
