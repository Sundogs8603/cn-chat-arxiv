    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）涉及多个设备共同训练一个共享模型，而无需传输他们的本地数据。FL减少了通信开销，使其成为无人机增强无线网络中一种有前景的学习方法，因为该网络能源稀缺。尽管有潜力，但在无人机增强网络中实现FL是具有挑战性的，传统的最大化覆盖范围的无人机部署方法会显著增加FL的延迟。此外，关键变量（如信道质量）的不确定性和缺乏先验信息使问题加剧。本文首先分析了带能量收集的无人机增强无线传感器网络（WSN）的统计特征。然后，我们基于多目标多臂赌博机理论开发了一个模型和解决方案，以最大化网络覆盖范围同时最小化FL延迟。此外，我们提出了另一种特别适用于具有大动作集和严格能量约束的UAV-WSN系统的解决方案。",
    "tldr": "本研究针对无人机增强网络中的联邦学习问题，提出了一种能够同时优化覆盖范围和减少收敛时间的解决方案。通过分析无人机增强的无线传感器网络的统计特征，以及基于多目标多臂赌博机理论，将FL和无人机部署方法相结合，能够有效地减少FL延迟并提高网络性能。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper addresses the problem of federated learning in UAV-enhanced networks and proposes a solution that optimizes both coverage range and convergence time. By analyzing the statistical characteristics of UAV-enhanced wireless sensor networks and using the multi-objective multi-armed bandit theory, the combination of FL and UAV placement methods effectively reduces FL delay and improves network performance."
