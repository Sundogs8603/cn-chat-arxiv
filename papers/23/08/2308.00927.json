In this work, we use the PINNs methodology for estimating reduced-order model parameters and the full velocity field from scatter 2D noisy measurements in the ascending aorta.

    "translated_abstract": "物理信息神经网络（PINNs）已经成为解决逆问题的强大工具，尤其是在没有完整系统信息并且只有散射测量数据的情况下。这在血液动力学中特别有用，因为边界信息通常很难建模，获取高质量的血流测量数据通常很困难。在这项工作中，我们使用PINNs方法来估计散射2D噪声测量数据在升主动脉中的缩减模型参数和完整的速度场。结果表明，在使用模拟数据时，该方法能够稳定准确地估计参数，而速度重建则取决于测量质量和流动模式复杂性。该方法可以解决与血液动力学和复杂耦合物理系统相关的临床相关逆问题。",
