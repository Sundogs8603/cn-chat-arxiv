    "translated_abstract": "本研究通过整合卡尔曼滤波器和分析曲线面积来增强线性回归模型，以最小化损失。目标是使用随机梯度下降（SGD）来开发最优的线性回归方程进行权重更新。我们的方法涉及一个逐步过程，从用户定义的参数开始。线性回归模型使用SGD进行训练，分别跟踪权重和损失，并最终进行压缩。然后，基于权重和损失数组训练卡尔曼滤波器以预测下一个合并后的权重。预测结果是将输入均值与权重相乘，经过损失评估后形成权重与损失的曲线。使用两点公式推导出曲线的方程，并通过积分计算曲线下面积。具有最小面积的线性回归方程成为最佳预测曲线。优点包括避免通过梯度下降进行常量权重更新，并且可以处理部分数据集，不像其他需要完整数据集的方法。",
