    "translated_abstract": "许多图神经网络中的关键组件是池化操作，它旨在减小图的大小同时保留重要的结构信息。然而，大多数现有的图池化策略依赖于通过使用图神经网络层获得的分配矩阵，该矩阵具有可训练的参数，往往导致显著的计算复杂性和池化过程的缺乏可解释性。本文提出了一种无监督图编码解码模型，通过学习一种异常评分函数对节点进行排序，从而检测出图中的异常节点。在编码阶段，我们设计了一种新的池化机制，命名为LCPool，它利用局部约束线性编码进行特征编码，通过求解带有局部正则化项的最小二乘优化问题来找到聚类分配矩阵。通过在编码过程中强制执行局部约束，LCPool被设计成免费",
