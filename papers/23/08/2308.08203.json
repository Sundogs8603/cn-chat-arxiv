    "translated_abstract": "大多数机器学习模型预测的是关于具体输出的概率分布，并且很难准确预测高熵序列分布中的名称。在这篇论文中，我们探索了寻找这些预测中的抽象、高精度模式，以便进行有用地捕捉罕见序列的抽象预测。在这篇简短的论文中，我们提出了Epicure，一种将序列模型的预测（例如beam search的输出）转化为简单模式的方法。Epicure将模型的预测映射到一个表示越来越一般模式的格点上，这些模式包含了具体模型预测的内容。在预测给定函数的源代码时选择描述性名称和检测给定函数中异常名称的任务上，我们展示了Epicure相较于仅使用最高概率模型预测更准确地命名模式与实际情况相匹配。在误报率为10%的情况下，Epicure预测的模式与实际情况匹配。",
