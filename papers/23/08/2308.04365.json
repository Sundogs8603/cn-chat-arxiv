    "translated_abstract": "因果推断是科学的关键目标，使研究人员能够通过观察数据得出关于对假定干预的预测的有意义的结论。路径模型、结构方程模型(SEMs)以及更一般的有向无环图(DAGs)能够明确地指定关于现象背后的因果结构的假设。与DAGs不同，SEMs假设线性关系，这可能导致函数错误规范，从而阻碍研究人员进行可靠的效果大小估计。相反，我们提出了超级学习者方程模型（SLEM），一种集成了机器学习超级学习者集成的路径建模技术。我们通过实证研究，证明了SLEM能够提供一致且无偏的因果效应估计，在与SEMs进行线性模型比较时表现出竞争力，并且在处理非线性关系时优于SEMs。",
