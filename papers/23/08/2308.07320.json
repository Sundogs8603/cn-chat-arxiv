    "abstract": "PM-Gati-Shakti Initiative, integration of ministries, including railways, ports, waterways, logistic infrastructure, mass transport, airports, and roads. Aimed at enhancing connectivity and bolstering the competitiveness of Indian businesses, the initiative focuses on six pivotal pillars known as \"Connectivity for Productivity\": comprehensiveness, prioritization, optimization, synchronization, analytical, and dynamic. In this study, we explore the application of these pillars to address the problem of \"Maximum Demand Forecasting in Delhi.\" Electricity forecasting plays a very significant role in the power grid as it is required to maintain a balance between supply and load demand at all times, to provide a quality electricity supply, for Financial planning, generation reserve, and many more. Forecasting helps not only in Production Planning but also in Scheduling like Import / Export which is very often in India and mostly required by the rural areas and North Eastern Regions of India.",

    "translated_abstract": "PM-Gati-Shakti倡议整合了包括铁路、港口、水路、物流基础设施、大众交通、机场和道路在内的多个部门。该倡议旨在提高连通性，增强印度企业的竞争力，重点关注六个关键支柱，即“提高生产力的连通性”：全面性、优先级、优化、同步性、分析性和动态性。本研究探讨了将这些支柱应用于解决“德里最大需求预测”问题的案例。电力预测在电网中起着非常重要的作用，因为它需要在任何时候保持供应和负荷需求之间的平衡，以提供优质的电力供应，用于财务规划、发电储备等。预测不仅有助于生产计划，还有助于进口/出口等调度，这在印度非常常见，也是印度农村地区和东北地区常常需要的。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study explores how to enhance India's energy future through improved connectivity and competitiveness, using the case of maximum demand forecasting in Delhi as an example under the PM-Gati Shakti initiative. Forecasting plays a crucial role in maintaining balance between supply and load demand, as well as for financial planning and scheduling, particularly for rural and northeastern regions of India."
