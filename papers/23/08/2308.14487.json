Our algorithm relies on the iterated time discretisation of the BSDE and approximates its solution and gradient using deep neural networks and automatic differentiation at each time step. The approximations are obtained by sequential minimisation of local quadratic loss functions at each time step through stochastic gradient descent. We provide an analysis of approximation error in the case of a network architecture with weight constraints requiring only low regularity conditions on the generator of the BSDE.
