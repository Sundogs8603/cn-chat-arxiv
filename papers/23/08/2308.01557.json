    "translated_abstract": "学习轨迹分布的先验知识可以加快机器人运动规划的优化。在给定先前成功的规划方案的情况下，学习轨迹生成模型作为新规划问题的先验知识是非常理想的。之前的研究提出了几种利用这种先验知识进行运动规划问题引导的方法。可以通过从先验知识中采样初始化，或者在最大后验优化的过程中使用先验分布。在本文中，我们提出了学习扩散模型作为先验知识的方法。然后，我们可以通过利用扩散模型的逆去噪过程，直接从任务目标条件下的后验轨迹分布中采样。此外，最近的研究表明，扩散在高维环境中可以有效地编码数据的多模态性，这对于大量的轨迹数据集非常适用。为了展示我们的方法的有效性，我们将我们提出的方法-运动规划扩散与几种基准方发进行了比较。",
