    "translated_abstract": "毫米波（mmWave）基于语音识别为音频相关应用提供了更多可能性，如会议演讲转录和窃听。然而，考虑到实际场景的可行性，延迟和可识别的词汇量是两个不容忽视的关键因素。本文提出了Radio2Text，这是第一个基于mmWave的流式自动语音识别（ASR）系统，其词汇量超过13,000个词。Radio2Text基于精心设计的流式Transformer，能够有效学习与语音相关特征的表示，为具有大词汇量的流式ASR铺平了道路。为了缓解流式网络无法访问整个未来输入的缺点，我们提出了Guidance Initialization，通过权重继承，促进将与全局上下文相关的特征知识从非流式Transformer传递给精心设计的流式Transformer。",
