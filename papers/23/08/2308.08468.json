    "translated_abstract": "物理知识神经网络(PINN)已经成为一种流行的深度学习框架，它可以无缝地合成观测数据和偏微分方程(PDE)约束。然而，它们的实际有效性可能受到训练病态的影响，而且常常因为缺乏深度学习专业知识的用户做出的不良选择而受到影响。在本文中，我们提出了一系列最佳实践，可以显著提高PINN的训练效率和整体精度。我们还提出了一系列具有挑战性的基准问题，突出显示了训练PINN的一些主要困难，并呈现了全面可复现的消融研究，展示了不同架构选择和训练策略对结果模型的测试精度的影响。我们表明，本研究提出的方法和指导原则可以导致最先进的结果，并为未来的研究提供强有力的基线进行比较。",
