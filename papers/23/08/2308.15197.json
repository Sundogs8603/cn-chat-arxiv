    "translated_abstract": "准确的人类移动预测在许多重要应用中起着关键作用，包括流行病建模、交通规划和应急响应。由于移动数据的稀疏性和人们日常活动的随机性，实现对人们位置的精确预测仍然是一个挑战。虽然最近开发的大型语言模型（LLMs）在许多与语言相关的任务中展现出卓越性能，但它们在人类移动研究中的适用性尚未被探索。为了填补这一空白，本文探讨了LLMs在人类移动预测任务中的潜力。我们引入了一种新方法LLM-Mob，它利用LLMs的语言理解和推理能力来分析人类移动数据。我们提出了历史停留和上下文停留的概念，以捕捉人类移动中的长期和短期依赖关系，并通过使用时间信息来实现时态感知预测。",
