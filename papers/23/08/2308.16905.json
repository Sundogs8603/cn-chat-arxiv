    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的任务，即预测三维人物-物体交互（HOIs）。大多数现有的HOI合成研究缺乏与动态物体的全身交互，例如，往往局限于操纵小型或静态物体。我们的任务更具挑战性，因为它需要对具有不同形状的动态物体进行建模，捕捉整体运动，并确保物理有效的交互。为此，我们提出了InterDiff，一个框架，包括两个关键步骤：（i）交互扩散，我们利用扩散模型对未来的人物-物体交互分布进行编码；（ii）交互校正，在扩散步骤中引入物理信息的预测器来纠正去噪的HOIs。我们的关键见解是注入先验知识，即与接触点相关的交互遵循简单的模式，并且易于预测。在多个人物-物体交互数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。",
