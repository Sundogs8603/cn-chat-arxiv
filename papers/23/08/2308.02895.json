    "translated_abstract": "这是我于2021年在法国学院发表的就职演讲的英文版本，可在https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxktplKMhKU获取。我反思了多学科研究的困难，这往往涉及意想不到的认识论和方法论差异，例如关于模型的科学地位。模型的目的是什么？我们最终要建立什么：严格的定理还是临时的计算方法？绝对真理还是对世界的启发性表达？我认为，统计物理学对社会和经济科学的主要贡献是让我们意识到集体行为可以在整体层面上出现，而孤立个体永远无法体验。危机、恐慌、舆论的逆转、谣言或信仰的传播、时尚效应和时代精神，以及金钱的存在、持久的机构、社会规范和稳定的社会，都必须从集体信仰和/或信任的角度来理解。",
