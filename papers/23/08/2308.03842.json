    "translated_abstract": "关于音乐行业中搜索引擎和基于推荐的系统的发展是一个最引人注目的辩论之一。研究表明，在搜索引擎领域存在着严重的抑郁，这是由于诸如速度、准确性以及查询数据的格式等令人担忧的因素所导致的。人们经常在仅根据标题搜索歌曲时遇到困难，因此提出了一种解决方案，通过单个查询输入完成搜索分析，并与数据库中的歌曲歌词进行匹配。因此，引入前沿技术工具以开发用户友好的搜索引擎至关重要。Jina AI是用于构建神经搜索引擎的MLOps框架，它被用于帮助用户获得准确的结果。Jina AI有效地帮助维护和提升搜索引擎对给定查询的性能质量。通过使用JinaAI构建了一个高效的音乐行业搜索引擎和推荐系统。",
