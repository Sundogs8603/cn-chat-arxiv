    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve many NLP tasks in zero-shot settings, applications involving embodied agents remain problematic. In particular, complex plans that require multi-step reasoning become difficult and too costly as the context window grows. Planning requires understanding the likely effects of one's actions and identifying whether the current environment satisfies the goal state. While symbolic planners find optimal solutions quickly, they require a complete and accurate representation of the planning problem, severely limiting their use in practical scenarios. In contrast, modern LLMs cope with noisy observations and high levels of uncertainty when reasoning about a task. Our work presents LLM Dynamic Planner (LLM-DP): a neuro-symbolic framework where an LLM works hand-in-hand with a traditional planner to solve an embodied task. Given action-descriptions, LLM-DP solves Alfworld faster and more efficiently than a naive LLM ReAct baseline.",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然大型语言模型（LLM）可以在零-shot情景下解决许多自然语言处理任务，但涉及具体代理的应用仍然存在问题。特别是，需要多步推理的复杂计划随着上下文窗口的增长变得困难和昂贵。规划需要理解行动的可能影响，并确定当前环境是否满足目标状态。虽然符号规划器可以快速找到最优解，但它们需要完整准确地表示规划问题，严重限制了它们在实际场景中的使用。相比之下，现代LLM在推理任务时能够处理嘈杂的观察结果和高水平的不确定性。我们的工作提出了LLM-Dynamic Planner（LLM-DP）：一个神经符号框架，在解决具体任务时LLM与传统规划器携手合作。给定行动描述，LLM-DP比朴素LLM ReAct基准更快、更高效地解决了Alfworld任务。",
