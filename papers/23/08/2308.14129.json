    "translated_abstract": "时间交互图(TIGs)被广泛应用于建模复杂的现实世界系统，如金融系统和社交网络。为了捕捉节点的动态性和相互依赖关系，现有的TIG嵌入模型需要按照顺序和时间顺序处理边。然而，这种要求阻止了并行处理，并且难以适应不断增长的数据量到GPU上。因此，许多大规模时间交互图被限制在CPU上处理。此外，目前还没有一种通用的GPU扩展和加速方法。为了实现在GPU上加速大规模TIG的实施，我们提出了一种新的训练方法，即基于流式边划分和并行加速的时间交互图嵌入(SPEED)。SPEED由流式边划分组件(SEP)和并行加速组件(PAC)组成，SEP通过将较少的节点分配给每个GPU来解决空间开销问题，而PAC则实现并行加速。",
