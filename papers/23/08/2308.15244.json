    "translated_abstract": "鉴于知识图谱包含丰富的语义信息，近年来一些KG-enhanced推荐方法层出不穷。现有方法大多是基于欧几里得空间设计的，没有考虑曲率。然而，最近的研究表明，巨大的图结构数据表现出高度非欧几里得的特性。在这项工作中，我们受到这些观察的启发，提出了一种基于知识的多重自适应空间融合推荐方法，称为MCKG。与现有方法仅采用特定流形的方法不同，我们引入了与双曲、欧几里得和球面空间兼容的统一空间。此外，在注意力方式下，我们融合了多个统一空间，以获取更好的知识传播的高质量嵌入。此外，我们提出了一种几何感知优化策略，使得拉和推过程可以充分利用双曲和球面空间的优势。具体而言，在双曲空间中，",
