    "translated_abstract": "最近，零样本节点分类（ZNC）在图数据分析中变得越来越重要。该任务旨在预测在训练过程中未观察到的未知类别的节点。现有的工作主要利用图神经网络(GNNs)将特征的原型和标签的语义联系起来，从而实现从已观察到的类别到未观察到的类别的知识迁移。然而，以往的研究忽视了特征-语义对齐中多方位语义方向的存在，即节点的内容通常涵盖与多个标签的语义相关的不同主题。因此，有必要区分和判断影响认知能力的语义因素，以提高模型的泛化性能。为此，我们提出了一种基于知识的多方位框架（KMF），通过提取基于知识图谱（KG）的主题来增强标签语义的丰富性。然后，将每个节点的内容重构为主题级别的表示。",
