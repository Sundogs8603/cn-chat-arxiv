    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is popular for its privacy-preserving and collaborative learning capabilities. Recently, personalized FL (pFL) has received attention for its ability to address statistical heterogeneity and achieve personalization in FL. However, from the perspective of feature extraction, most existing pFL methods only focus on extracting global or personalized feature information during local training, which fails to meet the collaborative learning and personalization goals of pFL. To address this, we propose a new pFL method, named GPFL, to simultaneously learn global and personalized feature information on each client. We conduct extensive experiments on six datasets in three statistically heterogeneous settings and show the superiority of GPFL over ten state-of-the-art methods regarding effectiveness, scalability, fairness, stability, and privacy. Besides, GPFL mitigates overfitting and outperforms the baselines by up to 8.99% in accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）因其保护隐私和协作学习的能力而受到欢迎。最近，个性化FL（pFL）因其能够解决统计异质性并在FL中实现个性化而受到关注。然而，从特征提取的角度来看，大多数现有的pFL方法只关注在本地训练过程中提取全局或个性化的特征信息，这无法满足pFL的协作学习和个性化目标。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的pFL方法，名为GPFL，用于在每个客户端上同时学习全局和个性化的特征信息。我们在三种统计异质的设置下对六个数据集进行了大量实验，并展示了GPFL在效果、可扩展性、公平性、稳定性和隐私性方面优于十种最先进方法的优越性。此外，GPFL减轻了过拟合现象，并在准确度上超过了基准线最高8.99%。",
    "tldr": "这里是中文总结出的一句话要点：GPFL是一种新的个性化联邦学习方法，它能够同时学习全局和个性化的特征信息，在效果、可扩展性、公平性、稳定性和隐私性方面优于其他方法，并减轻了过拟合现象，提升了准确度。",
    "en_tdlr": "Here is the English summary: GPFL is a novel personalized federated learning method that simultaneously learns global and personalized feature information. It outperforms other methods in terms of effectiveness, scalability, fairness, stability, and privacy. It also mitigates overfitting and improves accuracy."
