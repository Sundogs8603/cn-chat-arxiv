    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that it is possible to resynthesize high-quality speech based, not on text, but on low bitrate discrete units that have been learned in a self-supervised fashion and can therefore capture expressive aspects of speech that are hard to transcribe (prosody, voice styles, non-verbal vocalization). The adoption of these methods is still limited by the fact that most speech synthesis datasets are read, severely limiting spontaneity and expressivity. Here, we introduce Expresso, a high-quality expressive speech dataset for textless speech synthesis that includes both read speech and improvised dialogues rendered in 26 spontaneous expressive styles. We illustrate the challenges and potentials of this dataset with an expressive resynthesis benchmark where the task is to encode the input in low-bitrate units and resynthesize it in a target voice while preserving content and style. We evaluate resynthesis quality with automatic metrics for different self-supervised discrete ",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，不依赖于文本，而是基于在无监督学习中学习到的低比特率离散单元，可以重新合成高质量的语音，并且能够捕捉到难以转录的语音表达方面（韵律、声音风格、非语言语音化）。然而，由于大多数语音合成数据集都是朗读的，因此对 spontaneity 和 expressivity 的要求限制了这些方法的应用。本文引入了 Expresso，这是一个高质量的无文本语音合成数据集，包括朗读语音和26种自发表达风格的即兴对话。我们通过一个表达性重新合成基准测试来展示这个数据集的挑战和潜力，在这个任务中，需要以低比特率单元对输入进行编码，并在目标音色中重新合成，同时保持内容和风格。我们使用自动度量标准对不同的自监督离散合成方法进行了质量评估。",
