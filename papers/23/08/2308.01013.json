    "translated_abstract": "在加密货币交易中，识别加密货币之间的结构依赖关系并预测市场趋势对于有效管理投资组合至关重要。本文提出了一个基于潜力场理论和高斯过程的统一的贝叶斯框架，用历史价格信息来描绘各种加密货币的结构依赖关系。我们的研究工作有以下重要贡献：(i)提出了一个新的模型，将加密货币价格运动视为受时间变化的非线性潜力场驱动的动力系统的轨迹。(ii)通过Lyapunov稳定性分析验证了加密货币市场中非线性潜力函数的存在。(iii)开发了一个贝叶斯框架，用于根据观察到的加密货币价格推断非线性潜力函数。(iv)提出了从潜力场中推断出的吸引子和排斥子是可靠的加密货币市场指标，超越了现有的属性。",
