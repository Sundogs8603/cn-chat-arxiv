    "translated_abstract": "本文在缺失数据非随机的情况下，开发了一个推断框架来进行矩阵补全，并且无需强信号的要求。我们的方法基于观察到，如果缺失条目的数量相对于面板的大小足够小，即使缺失是非随机的，也可以很好地估计它们。利用这个事实，我们将缺失的条目分成较小的组，并通过核范数正则化来估计每组。此外，我们还证明了，在适当的去偏估计下，我们提出的估计量即使对于相当弱的信号也是渐近正态的。我们的研究受到了最近关于Tick Size Pilot Program的研究的启发，这是一项由美国证券交易委员会（SEC）从2016年到2018年进行的实验，旨在评估扩大股票最小变动价位（Tick Size）对市场品质的影响。而以往的研究都是基于传统的回归或差分法，假设处理效应在不变的情况下进行的。",

It introduces a method to divide missing entries into groups and estimate them using nuclear norm regularization. The proposed estimate is shown to be asymptotically normal even for weak signals. The motivation for this research comes from the Tick Size Pilot Program, which evaluated the impact of widening the tick size on stock market quality."
