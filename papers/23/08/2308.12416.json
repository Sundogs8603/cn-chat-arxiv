    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型已经在估计磁共振图像中的脑龄（一个重要的脑健康生物标志）方面取得了最先进的结果。然而，大多数模型只提供全局的年龄预测，并依赖于像显著性图这样的技术来解释结果。这些显著性图突出显示了对模型预测有重要意义的输入图像区域，但很难解释，并且显著性图的值在不同样本之间无法直接比较。在本研究中，我们将脑龄预测问题从磁共振图像转换为图像到图像的回归问题，其中我们估计每个脑部体素的脑龄。我们将逐体素年龄预测模型与全局年龄预测模型及其对应的显著性图进行对比。结果表明，逐体素年龄预测模型更易解释，因为它们提供了关于脑衰老过程的空间信息，并且它们从中受益。",
