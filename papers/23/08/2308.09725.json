    "translated_abstract": "精准医学的目标是建立癌症亚型的生化机制与疾病之间的因果关系。基于组学的癌症亚型划分已经成为一种革命性的方法，因为不同级别的组学记录了癌症中多步骤过程的生化产物。本文旨在充分利用多组学数据的潜力来改善癌症亚型划分结果，因此开发了MoCLIM，一种表示学习框架。MoCLIM独立地从不同的组学模式中提取有信息量的特征。通过对不同组学模式之间的对比学习所得到的统一表示，在给定癌症情况下，我们能够将亚型很好地聚类到较低的潜空间中。这种对比可以被解释为在生物网络中观察到的组际推理的投影。在六个癌症数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的方法在较少的高维癌症数据拟合和亚型划分性能方面显著改善。",
