    "abstract": "Poisoning attacks can disproportionately influence model behaviour by making small changes to the training corpus. While defences against specific poisoning attacks do exist, they in general do not provide any guarantees, leaving them potentially countered by novel attacks. In contrast, by examining worst-case behaviours Certified Defences make it possible to provide guarantees of the robustness of a sample against adversarial attacks modifying a finite number of training samples, known as pointwise certification. We achieve this by exploiting both Differential Privacy and the Sampled Gaussian Mechanism to ensure the invariance of prediction for each testing instance against finite numbers of poisoned examples. In doing so, our model provides guarantees of adversarial robustness that are more than twice as large as those provided by prior certifications.",

    "translated_abstract": "中毒攻击可以通过对训练语料进行微小改动来对模型行为产生不成比例的影响。虽然存在对特定中毒攻击的防御方法，但它们通常不提供任何保证，可能被新型攻击所对抗。相比之下，通过考察最坏情况下的行为，认证防御可以提供针对有限数量训练样本被敌对攻击修改的样本的鲁棒性保证，称为点对点认证。我们通过利用差分隐私和采样高斯机制，确保每个测试实例对有限数量中毒样本的预测具有不变性，从而实现了这一点。通过这样做，我们的模型提供的对抗鲁棒性保证比之前的认证方法提供的保证更大两倍以上。",
