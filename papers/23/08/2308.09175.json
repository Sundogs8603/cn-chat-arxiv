    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人工智能系统在各种计算任务上已经超过了人类的智能。然而，与人类一样，AI系统也会犯错误，有盲点，产生幻觉，并且在面对新情况时很难进行泛化。本研究探讨了当AI系统的计算合理性推到极限时，是否可以从创造性的决策机制中受益。特别是，我们研究了是否通过作为一个团队的多样化AI系统在具有挑战性的任务中可以胜过单个AI，通过生成更多的想法，然后选择最好的想法。我们以国际象棋这个被称为AI果蝇的游戏为例进行了研究。我们在AlphaZero (AZ)的基础上，通过潜变条件架构扩展它，构建了一个代理团队，我们称之为AZ_db。我们使用行为多样性技术对AZ_db进行训练，以生成更广泛的想法，并通过次加性计划选择最有希望的想法。我们的实验表明，AZ_db以不同方式下国际象棋。",
