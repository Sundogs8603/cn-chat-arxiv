    "abstract": "Online violence against children has increased globally recently, demanding urgent attention. Competent authorities manually analyze abuse complaints to comprehend crime dynamics and identify patterns. However, the manual analysis of these complaints presents a challenge because it exposes analysts to harmful content during the review process. Given these challenges, we present a novel solution, an automated tool designed to analyze children's sexual abuse reports comprehensively. By automating the analysis process, our tool significantly reduces the risk of exposure to harmful content by categorizing the reports on three dimensions: Subject, Degree of Criminality, and Damage. Furthermore, leveraging our multidisciplinary team's expertise, we introduce a novel approach to annotate the collected data, enabling a more in-depth analysis of the reports. This approach improves the comprehension of fundamental patterns and trends, enabling law enforcement agencies and policymakers to create ",

    "translated_abstract": "最近全球范围内对儿童的在线暴力事件有所增加，要求我们予以紧急关注。有关部门需要手动分析滥用投诉以了解犯罪动态并识别模式。然而，这些投诉的手动分析存在挑战，因为在审查过程中暴露分析员接触到有害内容。鉴于这些挑战，我们提出了一种创新的解决方案，即一种专为全面分析儿童性虐待报告而设计的自动化工具。通过自动化分析过程，我们的工具通过对报告在主题、犯罪程度和伤害程度三个维度进行分类，极大地降低了接触有害内容的风险。此外，利用我们多学科团队的专业知识，我们引入了一种新方法来对收集的数据进行注释，实现对报告的更深入分析。这种方法改善了对基本模式和趋势的理解，使执法部门和决策者能够创建",
