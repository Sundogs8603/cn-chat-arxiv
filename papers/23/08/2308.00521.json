    "translated_abstract": "本白皮书介绍了我们在SurveyLM上的工作，这是一个用于分析增强语言模型(ALM)在复杂社会环境中通过动态演变的态度和价值观展现出的紧密对齐行为的平台。像ALM这样的社交人工智能系统通常在细微的社交场景中运作，没有单一的正确回答，或者答案很大程度上取决于背景因素，因此需要深入理解它们的对齐动态。为了解决这个问题，我们应用传统社会行为研究中常用的调查和实验方法系统地评估ALM，从而提供了对其对齐和新兴行为的前所未有的深入洞察。此外，SurveyLM平台利用ALM自身的反馈来增强调查和实验设计，利用了ALM未充分利用的方面，加速了高质量调查框架的开发和测试，同时节约了资源。",
