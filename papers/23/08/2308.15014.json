To that end, we introduce Constrained Approximate Partitioned Search (CAPS), an index for ANNS with filters via space partitions that not only retains the benefits of a partition-based algorithm but also outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based constrained search techniques in recall-latency tradeoffs, with only 10% of the index size.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着神经表示学习的进步，近似近邻搜索（ANNS）的流行度越来越高，同时也加强了对能够在查询中附带一组约束的能力的关注。尽管社区最近提出了几种用于约束ANNS的算法，但几乎所有这些方法都集中在与基于图的索引的集成上，这是一种能够在延迟-召回权衡中实现最先进性能的主要算法类别。在这项工作中，我们采用了不同的方法，专注于通过空间分区而不是图来开发约束ANNS算法。为此，我们引入了约束近似分区搜索（CAPS），这是一种通过空间分区进行带有过滤的ANNS索引，不仅保留了基于分区的算法的优势，而且在召回-延迟权衡方面胜过最先进的基于图的约束搜索技术，而且只需要10%的索引大小。",
