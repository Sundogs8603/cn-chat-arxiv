Given appropriate datasets, the model can be used to regress the analytical value of the structure's bending stiffness, interpolate responses, and make probabilistic inferences on latent physical quantities. The developed model is applied on a numerically simulated cantilever beam, where the regressed bending stiffness is evaluated and the influence measurement noise on the prediction quality is investigated. Further, the regressed probabilistic stiffness distribution is used in a structural health monitoring context, where the Mahalanobis distance is employed to reason about the possible location and extent of damage in the structural system.

    "translated_abstract": "通过使用欧拉-伯努利梁方程，构建了一种以多输出高斯过程形式的物理信息机器学习模型。在合适的数据集下，该模型可以用于回归结构的弯曲刚度的解析值、插值响应以及对潜在物理量进行概率推断。该模型被应用于数值模拟的悬臂梁上，评估了回归的弯曲刚度，并研究了预测质量受测量噪声的影响。此外，利用回归得到的概率刚度分布，在结构健康监测背景下，采用马氏距离来推断结构系统中可能的损伤位置和范围。为了验证开发的框架，进行了一项实验，使用测量的异质数据集来更新假定的解析结构模型。",
