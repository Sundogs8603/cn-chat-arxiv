    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）模型训练了主观自我报告评分后，由于实时疼痛体验和后续记录得分之间的显著变异，很难准确地客观分类疼痛。本研究开发了两个设备，用于获取实时连续会话中的疼痛评分和自主神经系统调节的内胚层活动（EDA）数据。实验招募N = 24名受试者，进行了运动后循环阻塞（PECO）伸展引起的不适。受试者数据存储在定制的疼痛平台中，便于提取时域EDA特征和会话中的准确评分。此外，还从每个受试者收集了实验后的视觉模拟量表（VAS）评分。分别使用相应的客观EDA特征结合会话中得分和会话后得分，训练了多层感知器（MLP）和随机森林（RF）等机器学习模型。在10倍交叉验证中，进行了宏观平均功能评估。",
