    "translated_abstract": "近年来，随着跟踪-检测方法的简洁性和强大先验条件使其摆脱了跟踪-注意力方法的复杂设计和麻烦，多目标跟踪领域对跟踪-检测方法重新产生了兴趣。在这种背景下，我们旨在将跟踪-检测方法扩展到多模态设置，其中需要从异构信息（例如2D运动线索、视觉外观和姿态估计）计算综合成本。具体而言，我们通过一个案例研究来融合具有粗略估计的三维信息和其他传统度量（例如IoU）。为了实现这一目标，最近的方法采用简单规则或复杂启发式方法来平衡每个成本的贡献。然而，它们需要在一个保留集上对定制超参数进行仔细调整，并且暗示这些成本是相互独立的，而这在现实中并不成立。我们通过建立一个优雅的概率模型来解决这些问题。",
