Poker is a game that requires decision making under uncertainty and incomplete information. In this paper, we put ChatGPT and GPT-4 through the poker test and evaluate their poker skills. Our findings reveal that while both models display an advanced understanding of poker, encompassing concepts like the valuation of starting hands, playing positions and other intricacies of game theory optimal (GTO) poker, both ChatGPT and GPT-4 are NOT game theory optimal poker players.  Through a series of experiments, we first discover the characteristics of optimal prompts and model parameters for playing poker with these models. Our observations then unveil the distinct playing personas of the two models. We first conclude that GPT-4 is",

    "translated_abstract": "自ChatGPT和GPT-4问世以来，这些模型已在许多任务中进行了测试。它们在各个领域的熟练程度是显而易见的，但它们在游戏中的能力，特别是在扑克领域的能力，还未被探索。扑克是一种需要在不确定性和不完全信息下做出决策的游戏。在本文中，我们对ChatGPT和GPT-4进行了扑克测试，并评估了它们的扑克技能。我们的研究结果显示，虽然这两个模型都展示了对扑克的高级理解，包括起始手牌的估值、打牌位置以及游戏论理最优(GTO)扑克的其他复杂性，但ChatGPT和GPT-4并不是游戏论理最优的扑克玩家。通过一系列实验，我们首先发现了与使用这些模型玩扑克相关的最佳提示和模型参数的特征。接着，我们观察到了这两个模型具有不同的打牌风格。最终，我们得出结论：GPT-4是",
