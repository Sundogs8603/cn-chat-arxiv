    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在由服务器和多个设备组成的无线系统中的联邦背景下的线性赌博学习。每个设备与环境交互，在接收到奖励后选择一个动作，并将模型更新发送到服务器。主要目标是在有限的时间范围内最小化所有设备的累积遗憾。为了减少通信开销，设备通过无线计算（AirComp）在噪声衰落信道上与服务器通信，其中通道噪声可能会扭曲信号。在这个背景下，我们提出了一种定制的联邦线性赌博方案，其中每个设备传输一个模拟信号，服务器接收到的是这些信号的叠加，受到信道噪声的扭曲。我们进行了严格的数学分析，确定了该方案的遗憾上限。理论分析和数值实验都证明了我们提出的方案在性能方面的竞争力。",
