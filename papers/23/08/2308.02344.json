    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了从网络上的高斯图模型（Gaussian Graphical Model，简称GGM）的重复测量中估计加权网络结构的问题。在这个方面，我们考虑了与基于其上加权网络的几何结构相一致的GGM的协方差结构。这种GGM在统计物理学中一直受到关注，并被称为高斯自由场（Gaussian Free Field，简称GFF）。近年来，它们在机器学习和理论计算机科学领域引起了广泛的兴趣。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于高斯分布的傅里叶分析特性的重复测量的GFF来估计加权网络（等价地，其拉普拉斯矩阵）的新型估计量。在这个过程中，我们的方法利用了从观测数据中构造的复数值统计量，这些统计量本身就具有研究价值。我们通过具体的恢复保证和对所需采样的界限来证明我们的估计器的有效性。",
