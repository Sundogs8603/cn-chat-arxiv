    "translated_abstract": "在物联网时代，智能系统对高级上下文(HLC)推理的自动化变得至关重要，这是因为上下文数据的不断积累、多源数据融合的趋势以及基于上下文决策过程的固有复杂性和动态性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种自动上下文推理框架CSM-H-R，该框架在运行时以编程方式组合本体和状态，并结合模型存储阶段，以实现识别有意义的HLC的能力，所得到的数据表示可应用于不同的推理技术。在智能校园环境中基于智能电梯系统开展了案例研究。框架的实现-CSM引擎以及将HLC推理转化为矢量和矩阵计算的实验，特别关注上下文的动态特性，并展示了使用先进的数学和概率模型的潜力。",
