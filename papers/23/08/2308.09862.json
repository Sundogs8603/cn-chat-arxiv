To tackle the challenge of data scarcity, we have developed a novel approach for translating the SQuAD 2.0 dataset into Hindi and Marathi.

We evaluate the dataset on various architectures and release the best-performing models for both Hindi and Marathi, which ",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习的最新进展导致了开发出高度复杂的系统，对数据有着无止境的需求。然而，对于低资源语言来说，构建良好的深度学习模型仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。本文重点是为两种这样的语言-印地语和马拉地语-开发一个问答数据集。虽然印地语是全球第三大使用人数最多的语言，拥有3.45亿说话者，而马拉地语则是全球第11大使用人数最多的语言，拥有8.32千万说话者，但这两种语言在构建高效的问答系统的资源上都面临限制。为了解决数据稀缺的挑战，我们开发了一种新颖的方法来将SQuAD 2.0数据集翻译成印地语和马拉地语。我们发布了这两种语言中最大的问答数据集，每个数据集包含28,000个样本。我们在各种架构上评估了数据集，并发布了在印地语和马拉地语中表现最好的模型。",
