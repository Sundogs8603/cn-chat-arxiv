    "translated_abstract": "在室内环境中使用毫米波频率调制连续波（FMCW）雷达进行人员存在检测是具有挑战性的，主要是因为室内空间中存在移动和静止的杂波。本文提出了一种名为“HOOD”的实时稳健的人员存在和离群检测方法，通过利用60 GHz短距离FMCW雷达。我们将存在检测应用视为离群检测问题，并使用单一流程同时解决这两个问题。我们的解决方案依赖于基于重构的架构，并使用雷达宏观和微观范围-Doppler图像（RDI）。HOOD旨在在存在或不存在移动和静止干扰物的情况下准确检测人类的“存在”。由于它也是一个离群检测器，它旨在将移动或静止杂波作为人类不存在的离群检测，并将当前场景的输出预测为“无人存在”。HOOD是一种无需任何活动的方法，适用于不同的人类场景。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a real-time robust method called HOOD for human presence and out-of-distribution detection using low-cost 60 GHz FMCW radar. It addresses the challenges of detecting human presence in the presence of moving and stationary clutters by simultaneously solving the OOD detection problem. The method relies on a reconstruction-based architecture and successfully detects human presence while also detecting moving or stationary clutters in the absence of humans."
