    "translated_abstract": "图形模型在从生物分析到推荐系统等众多任务中展现出了良好的性能。然而，具有核心节点的图形模型在数据维度较大时计算上存在困难。为了高效估计核心图形模型，我们提出了一个两阶段算法。所提出的算法首先通过双重交替方向乘子法 (ADMM) 生成一个良好的初始点，然后使用半平滑牛顿 (SSN) 基于增广对偶法 (ALM) 的方法进行热启动，以计算出能够在实际任务中精确到足够程度的解。广义雅可比矩阵的稀疏结构确保了该算法能够非常高效地获得一个良好的解。在合成数据和真实数据的全面实验中，该算法明显优于现有的最先进算法。特别是在某些高维任务中，它可以节省超过70\\%的执行时间，同时仍然可以达到很好的性能。",
