    "translated_abstract": "互惠性，或者说个体呈现行为的趋同性，是描述社交网络中信息交流的关键指标。社交网络中的用户往往呈现不同程度的互惠行为。这种行为的差异可能表明存在以不同速率互换链接的社区。本文提出了一种方法来模拟不断增长的社交网络中多样的互惠行为。具体而言，我们提出了一种具有异质互惠性的优先连接模型，该模型模拟了用户对受欢迎用户的吸引力，以及他们对链接的异质性回应。我们比较了贝叶斯和频率主义的用于大型网络的模型拟合技术，以及计算效率高的变分替代方法。同时考虑了已知和未知社区数量的情况。我们将所提出的方法应用于分析一个Facebook留言网络，其中用户具有非均匀的互惠行为。",
