We aim to investigate the current state and dynamics of adversarial attacks and defenses for neural network models that use sequential financial data as the input.  To achieve this goal, we have designed a competition that allows realistic and detailed investigation of problems in modern financial transaction data. The participants compete directly against each other, so possible attacks and defenses are examined in close-to-real-life conditions.

    "translated_abstract": "鉴于金融领域恶意攻击风险不断升级和由此引发的严重损害，对机器学习模型的对抗策略和鲁棒的防御机制有深入的理解至关重要。随着银行日益广泛采用更精确但潜在脆弱的神经网络，这一威胁变得更加严重。我们旨在调查使用序列金融数据作为输入的神经网络模型的对抗攻击和防御的当前状态和动态。为了实现这一目标，我们设计了一个比赛，允许对现代金融交易数据中的问题进行逼真而详细的研究。参与者直接竞争，因此可能的攻击和防御在接近真实条件下进行了检验。我们的主要贡献是分析比赛动态，回答了隐藏模型免受恶意用户攻击的重要性以及需要多长时间才能破解模型的问题。",
