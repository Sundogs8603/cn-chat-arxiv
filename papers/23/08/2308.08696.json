    "translated_abstract": "异常分割在识别图像中的异常对象方面起着至关重要的作用，这有助于自动驾驶中的道路异常检测。尽管现有方法在使用合成训练数据进行异常分割方面取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但往往忽视了合成训练数据与真实测试数据之间的领域差异。为了解决这个问题，提出了用于复杂驾驶环境中的异常分割的多粒度跨领域对齐（MGCDA）框架。它独特地结合了一种新的多源领域对抗训练（MDAT）模块和一种新颖的跨领域异常感知对比学习（CACL）方法，以提高模型的普适性，无缝地在场景和样本级别集成多领域数据。多源领域对抗损失和动态标签平滑策略被整合到MDAT模块中，以促进在场景级别上获得领域不变特征，通过对抗生成领域不变的特征编码。",
