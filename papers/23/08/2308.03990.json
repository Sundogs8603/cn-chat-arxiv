    "abstract": "This paper presents the Never Ending Open Learning Adaptive Framework (NEOLAF), an integrated neural-symbolic cognitive architecture that models and constructs intelligent agents. The NEOLAF framework is a superior approach to constructing intelligent agents than both the pure connectionist and pure symbolic approaches due to its explainability, incremental learning, efficiency, collaborative and distributed learning, human-in-the-loop enablement, and self-improvement. The paper further presents a compelling experiment where a NEOLAF agent, built as a problem-solving agent, is fed with complex math problems from the open-source MATH dataset. The results demonstrate NEOLAF's superior learning capability and its potential to revolutionize the field of cognitive architectures and self-improving adaptive instructional systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了永不停止的开放学习自适应框架(NEOLAF)，这是一种集成了神经符号认知架构，用于建模和构建智能代理的方法。NEOLAF框架相比纯连接主义和纯符号方法更具有解释性、增量学习、高效性、协作和分布式学习、人工协助和自我改进的优势。本文还提出了一个引人注目的实验，其中一个作为问题解决代理的NEOLAF代理被输入了来自开源MATH数据集的复杂数学问题。结果表明NEOLAF具有优秀的学习能力，并有潜力在认知架构和自适应教学系统领域引起革命。",
