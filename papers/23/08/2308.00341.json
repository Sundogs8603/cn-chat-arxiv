    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能和机器学习软件在决策中的应用越来越多地影响人类，它们在决策过程中保持公平和无偏的要求变得至关重要。为了补充设计时的偏差缓解措施，近期引入了一些运行时验证技术来监控部署系统的算法公平性。之前的监控技术假设对（未知的）被监控系统的状态具有完全可观测性。此外，它们只能监控被指定为不同事件的概率的算术表达式的公平性属性。在这项工作中，我们将公平性监控扩展到部分观察到的马尔可夫链（POMC）模型的系统，并且针对包含对事件序列上的数值函数的期望值的算术表达式的规范。我们仅做出的假设是基础POMC是非周期性的并且起始于稳定分布，且对于其混合时间有一个已知的上界。",
