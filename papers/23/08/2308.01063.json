    "translated_abstract": "图异常检测（GAD）已经取得成功，并广泛应用于欺诈检测、网络安全、金融安全和生物化学等领域。然而，现有的图异常检测算法主要关注区分图中的个体实体（节点或图），忽视了图中可能存在的异常组的可能性。为了解决这个限制，本文提出了一种新的无监督框架，用于名为组级图异常检测（Gr-GAD）的新任务。该提议的框架首先使用图自动编码器的变种来定位属于可能异常组的锚定节点，通过捕捉长程不一致性。随后，组采样被用来采样候选组，然后将其输入到所提出的基于拓扑模式的图对比学习（TPGCL）方法中。TPGCL利用组的拓扑模式作为线索为每个候选组生成嵌入，从而区分不同的异常组。",
