Most existing BIA studies analyze guests personalized behavior at item granularity. A category-based model may be more appropriate in such scenarios. We propose a recommendation system called a hierarchical PCIC model that consists of a personalized category model (PC model) and a personalized item model within categories (IC model). PC model generates a personalized list of categories that customers are likely to purchase again. IC model ranks items within categories that guests are likely to consume within a category. The hierarchical PCIC model captures the general consumption rate of products using survival models. Trends in consumption are captured using time series models.

    "translated_abstract": "“再次购买”（BIA）推荐对于零售商来说至关重要，通过根据客户自己的重复购买模式提供可能再次购买的商品推荐，以改善用户体验和网站参与度。大多数现有的BIA研究分析了客户在商品粒度上的个性化行为。在这种情况下，基于类别的模型可能更合适。我们提出了一种名为“层次化PCIC模型”的推荐系统，它包括了个性化类别模型（PC模型）和类别内个性化商品模型（IC模型）。PC模型生成了一个个性化的类别列表，显示了客户可能再次购买的类别。IC模型在类别内对商品进行排名，显示了客户在类别内可能消费的商品。层次化PCIC模型使用生存模型捕捉产品的一般消费率。时间序列模型捕捉了消费趋势。从这些模型中提取的特征被用来训练一个基于类别的神经网络。",
