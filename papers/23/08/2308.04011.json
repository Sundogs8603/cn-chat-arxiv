    "translated_abstract": "从观测网络数据中估计因果效应是一个重要而具有挑战性的问题。现有的因果推断相关的研究缺乏对泛化界限的分析，而泛化界限在理论上可以支持缓解复杂的混淆偏差，并且可以在实际中以原则性的方式指导学习目标的设计。为了填补这一空白，我们通过利用基于联合倾向得分的重新加权模式和基于积分概率度量（IPM）的表示学习模式，推导出了用于网络场景中因果效应估计的泛化界限。我们从重新加权和表示学习两个角度提供了关于泛化界限的理解。在界限分析的驱动下，我们提出了一种基于联合倾向得分和表示学习的加权回归方法。通过对两个实际网络和半合成数据的广泛实验研究进行评估。",
