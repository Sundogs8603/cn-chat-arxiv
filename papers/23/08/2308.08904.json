    "translated_abstract": "疼痛是一个复杂的概念，可以与其他概念相互关联，比如可能引起疼痛的疾病，可能缓解疼痛的药物等等。为了完全理解个体或整个人群所经历的疼痛背景，我们需要研究与疼痛相关的所有概念及其之间的关系。当建模电子健康记录中记录的疼痛时，这尤为有用。知识图谱通过一个相互链接的网络来表示概念和它们的关系，以一种计算可处理的方式实现语义和基于上下文的推理。然而，这些图谱可能过大以至于计算效率低下。而知识图谱嵌入有助于解决这个问题，它将图谱表示为低维向量空间。然后，这些嵌入可以用于各种下游任务，如分类和链接预测。构建这样一个知识图谱所需的与疼痛相关的各种关系可以o",
