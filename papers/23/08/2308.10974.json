    "translated_abstract": "企业竞争和勾结涉及复杂的动态，尤其是考虑到企业之间的沟通。这些问题可以被建模为复杂系统的问题，传统上通过涉及人类主体或基于代理的建模方法进行探究。我们提出了一种创新的框架，称为智能代理建模（SABM），其中由GPT-4技术支持的智能代理代表企业并相互交互。我们进行了一项控制实验，研究了不同条件下企业价格竞争和勾结行为。与使用人类主体进行实验相比，SABM更具成本效益和灵活性。智能代理拥有决策的广泛知识库，展现出类似人类的战略能力，超越了传统的基于代理的建模方法。此外，智能代理能够模拟人类对话并个性化，使其成为研究涉及沟通的复杂情况的理想选择。我们的结果表明...",
