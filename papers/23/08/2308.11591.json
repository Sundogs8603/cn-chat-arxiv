    "translated_abstract": "抑郁症是一种常见但严重的心理障碍，每年影响数百万美国高中生。然而，准确的诊断和早期发现仍然是重大挑战。在公共卫生领域，研究表明神经网络在识别其他疾病如癌症和HIV方面产生了有希望的结果。本研究提出了类似的方法，利用机器学习和人工神经网络模型对学生的抑郁症进行分类。此外，本研究还强调了种族亚组的相关因素差异，并主张需要更广泛和多样化的数据集。模型在全国青少年风险行为监测系统（YRBSS）调查数据上进行训练，其中通过统计分析找到了抑郁症的最相关因素。该调查数据是一个包含15000个条目的结构化数据集，包括三个种族子集，每个子集包含900个条目。在分类方面，研究问题被建模为一个有监督的问题。",
