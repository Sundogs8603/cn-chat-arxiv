    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习旨在在保护客户数据隐私的同时协同训练全局模型。然而，由于客户数据的非独立同分布，联邦学习面临挑战。聚类联邦学习(CFL)作为一种有前景的解决方案已经出现，但大多数现有的CFL框架都采用同步框架缺乏异步性。提出了一种基于有向无环图分布式账本技术(DAG-DLT)的异步CFL框架SDAGFL，但其完全去中心化导致了高通信和存储成本。我们提出了DAG-ACFL，这是一种基于DAG-DLT的异步聚类FL框架。首先详细介绍了DAG-ACFL的组成部分。然后设计了一种基于模型参数的余弦相似度的tip选择算法，以聚合具有相似分布的客户端的模型。采用自适应tip选择算法，利用变点检测动态确定所选tip的数量。我们评估了DAG-ACFL的性能并与其他方法进行了比较。",
