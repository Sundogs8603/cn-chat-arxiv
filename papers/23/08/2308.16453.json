    "translated_abstract": "移动互联网在各个方面深刻地改变了现代生活方式。加密流量分类在管理移动互联网中起到了至关重要的作用，特别是在移动应用程序使用加密通信的爆炸性增长的情况下。尽管一些现有的基于学习的加密流量分类方法显示出了有希望的结果，但在真实网络环境中仍然存在三个限制：1）由流量类别不平衡引起的标签偏见，2）由组件共享引起的流量均匀性，以及3）依赖充足标记流量进行训练。没有任何现有的加密流量分类方法能够解决所有这些限制。本文提出了一种新颖的基于预训练的半监督加密流量分类框架，称为PASS。我们的关键见解是重新采样原始的训练数据集，并进行对比性预训练，而不直接使用个体应用程序标签，以避免由于类别不平衡引起的标签偏见问题，同时获得稳健的特征表示来区分重叠的流量。",
