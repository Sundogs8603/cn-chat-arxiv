    "abstract": "Time domain astronomy is advancing towards the analysis of multiple massive datasets in real time, prompting the development of multi-stream machine learning models. In this work, we study Domain Adaptation (DA) for real/bogus classification of astronomical alerts using four different datasets: HiTS, DES, ATLAS, and ZTF. We study the domain shift between these datasets, and improve a naive deep learning classification model by using a fine tuning approach and semi-supervised deep DA via Minimax Entropy (MME). We compare the balanced accuracy of these models for different source-target scenarios. We find that both the fine tuning and MME models improve significantly the base model with as few as one labeled item per class coming from the target dataset, but that the MME does not compromise its performance on the source dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "时间域天文学正朝着实时分析多个大规模数据集的方向发展，促使多流机器学习模型的发展。本文使用四个不同的数据集（HiTS、DES、ATLAS和ZTF）研究了天文警报的真伪分类的领域适应（DA）。我们研究了这些数据集之间的领域变化，并通过使用微调方法和半监督深度领域适应（MME）改进了一个简单的深度学习分类模型。我们比较了这些模型在不同源目标情景下的平衡准确性。我们发现，微调模型和MME模型都能显著改进基本模型，即使从目标数据集中只有一个标记的项，而且MME模型不会损害源数据集上的性能。",
