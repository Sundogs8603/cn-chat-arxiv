    "translated_abstract": "在真实世界中，对于使用人工智能系统来执行物理环境中的任务是一个至关重要却具有挑战性的问题。物理模拟任务通常被用来促进解决这一挑战的研究。本文首先提出了一种系统的方法，使用物体之间的物理交互的因果序列来定义物理场景。然后，我们提出了一种利用这些定义的场景作为输入，在模拟物理环境中生成任务的方法学。我们的方法可以更好地理解解决基于物理的任务所需的微观力学，从而为评估人工智能系统的物理推理能力提供准确的评估。我们使用基于物理的益智游戏“愤怒的小鸟”来演示我们提出的任务生成方法，并使用一系列指标对生成的任务进行评估，包括物理稳定性、使用预期物理相互作用的可解性以及使用意外相互作用的偶然可解性。",
