    "abstract": "This paper applies the Hotelling model to the context of exhaustible human resources in China. We find that over-exploitation of human resources occurs under conditions of restricted population mobility, rigid wage levels, and increased foreign trade demand elasticity. Conversely, the existence of technological replacements for human resources or improvements in the utilization rate of human resources leads to conservation. Our analysis provides practical insights for policy-making towards sustainable development.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文在中国的人力资源枯竭背景下应用Hotelling模型进行研究。我们发现，在人口流动受限、工资水平僵化和外贸需求弹性增加的情况下，人力资源的过度开发会发生。相反，存在人力资源的技术替代品或提高人力资源利用率将导致资源的节约利用。我们的分析为可持续发展的政策制定提供了实用的洞察。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the relationship between exhaustible human resources and economic development in China, and applies the Hotelling model to analyze the impact of factors such as population mobility, wage levels, and foreign trade demand elasticity. The findings suggest that over-exploitation of human resources can occur under certain conditions, while technological replacements and improved utilization rates can contribute to resource conservation. The insights from this study have practical implications for policy-making towards sustainable development."
