    "abstract": "Motifs, which have been established as building blocks for network structure, move beyond pair-wise connections to capture longer-range correlations in connections and activity. In spite of this, there are few generative graph models that consider higher-order network structures and even fewer that focus on using motifs in models of dynamic graphs. Most existing generative models for temporal graphs strictly grow the networks via edge addition, and the models are evaluated using static graph structure metrics -- which do not adequately capture the temporal behavior of the network. To address these issues, in this work we propose DYnamic MOtif-NoDes (DYMOND) -- a generative model that considers (i) the dynamic changes in overall graph structure using temporal motif activity and (ii) the roles nodes play in motifs (e.g., one node plays the hub role in a wedge, while the remaining two act as spokes). We compare DYMOND to three dynamic graph generative model baselines on real-world network",

    "translated_abstract": "动机已经被确定为网络结构的构建模块，超越了成对连接，捕捉了连接和活动中的长程相关性。尽管如此，很少有考虑高阶网络结构的生成图模型，甚至更少的关注在动态图模型中使用动机。大多数现有的用于时间图的生成模型严格通过边缘添加增长网络，并使用静态图结构度量来评估模型--这并不能充分捕捉网络的时间行为。为了解决这些问题，在这项工作中，我们提出了DYnamic MOtif-NoDes (DYMOND)——一种生成模型，考虑了(i)整体图结构的动态变化，使用时间动机活动和(ii)节点在图案中扮演的角色（例如，一个节点在楔形中处于枢纽角色，而其余两个节点扮演从属角色）。我们将DYMOND与三个实际网络上的动态图生成模型基准进行了比较",
