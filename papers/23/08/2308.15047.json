    "abstract": "Large language models show human-like performance in knowledge extraction, reasoning and dialogue, but it remains controversial whether this performance is best explained by memorization and pattern matching, or whether it reflects human-like inferential semantics and world knowledge. Knowledge bases such as WikiData provide large-scale, high-quality representations of inferential semantics and world knowledge. We show that large language models learn to organize concepts in ways that are strikingly similar to how concepts are organized in such knowledge bases. Knowledge bases model collective, institutional knowledge, and large language models seem to induce such knowledge from raw text. We show that bigger and better models exhibit more human-like concept organization, across four families of language models and three knowledge graph embeddings.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型在知识提取、推理和对话方面展现出人类水平的表现，但这种表现是由于记忆和模式匹配，还是反映了类似于人类推理语义和世界知识的表现仍然存在争议。知识库（如WikiData）提供了推理语义和世界知识的大规模高质量表示。我们展示了大型语言模型学会以与这些知识库中概念的组织方式惊人相似的方式组织概念。知识库模拟了集体、机构化的知识，而大型语言模型似乎从原始文本中产生了这样的知识。我们展示了更大更好的模型在概念组织上表现出更加人类化的特点，涵盖了四个语言模型系列和三个知识图谱嵌入方法。",
