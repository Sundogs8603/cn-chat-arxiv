    "translated_abstract": "在本报告中，我提出了一种深度学习方法，用于进行自然语言处理（以下简称NLP）的二元分类任务，以分析金融欺诈文本。首先，我搜索了港交所新闻的监管公告和执法公告，以定义欺诈公司并提取其MD＆A报告，然后整理了报告中的句子，并标记了报告时间。我的方法包括各种神经网络模型，包括具有嵌入层的多层感知器（MLP），基本循环神经网络（RNN），长短期记忆（LSTM）和门限循环单元（GRU）用于文本分类任务。通过利用这个多样化的模型集合，我旨在全面比较它们在检测金融欺诈方面的准确性。我的结果对于金融欺诈检测具有重要意义，因为这项工作为深度学习，NLP和金融交叉研究的不断增长贡献了有价值的研究成果",
