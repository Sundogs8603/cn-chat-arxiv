    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, recommendation systems (RSs) have used machine learning (ML) solutions to recommend items, e.g., movies, books, and restaurants, to clients of a business or an online platform. Recipe recommendation, however, has not yet received much attention compared to those applications. We introduce RECipe as a multi-purpose recipe recommendation framework with a multi-modal knowledge graph (MMKG) backbone. The motivation behind RECipe is to go beyond (deep) neural collaborative filtering (NCF) by recommending recipes to users when they query in natural language or by providing an image. RECipe consists of 3 subsystems: (1) behavior-based recommender, (2) review-based recommender, and (3) image-based recommender. Each subsystem relies on the embedding representations of entities and relations in the graph. We first obtain (pre-trained) embedding representations of textual entities, such as reviews or ingredients, from a fine-tuned model of Microsoft's MPNet. We initiali",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的两十年中，推荐系统（RS）已经使用机器学习（ML）的解决方案为商业或在线平台的客户推荐电影、图书和餐厅等物品。然而，相对于这些应用，菜谱推荐尚未得到很多关注。我们介绍了RECipe作为一个多用途的菜谱推荐框架，具有多模态知识图谱（MMKG）的支撑。RECipe的动机是通过在用户以自然语言查询或提供图像时向用户推荐菜谱，超越（深度）神经协同过滤（NCF）。RECipe由3个子系统组成：基于行为的推荐器、基于评论的推荐器和基于图像的推荐器。每个子系统都依赖于图中实体和关系的嵌入表示。我们首先从微软的MPNet模型的微调模型中获取文本实体（例如评论或成分）的（预训练）嵌入表示。",
