Specifically, we conduct theoretical analyses to reveal that label noise leads to weakened DNN generalization by loosening the PAC-Bayes generalization bound, and feature noise results in better DNN generalization by imposing an upper bound on the mutual information between the model weights and the features, which constrains the PAC-Bayes generalization bound. Furthermore, to ensure effective generalization of DNNs in the presence of label noise, we conduct application analyses to identify the optimal types and levels of feature noise to add for obtaining desirable label noise generalization.

    "translated_abstract": "训练数据中的标签噪声对深度神经网络（DNNs）的泛化能力有深远影响。本研究引入并理论上证明了一种简单的特征噪声方法，直接给训练数据的特征添加噪声，可以提升带有标签噪声下的DNNs的泛化能力。具体来说，我们进行了理论分析，揭示了标签噪声通过放宽PAC-Bayes泛化界限而导致DNN泛化能力减弱，而特征噪声通过对模型权重与特征之间的互信息设置上界来约束PAC-Bayes泛化界限，从而得到更好的DNN泛化能力。此外，为了在标签噪声存在的情况下确保DNN的有效泛化能力，我们进行了应用分析，确定了添加合适的特征噪声类型和水平以获得理想的标签噪声泛化能力。最后，我们在几个流行的数据集上进行了大量实验结果验证。",
