    "abstract": "Surveillance videos and images are used for a broad set of applications, ranging from traffic analysis to crime detection. Extrinsic camera calibration data is important for most analysis applications. However, security cameras are susceptible to environmental conditions and small camera movements, resulting in a need for an automated re-calibration method that can account for these varying conditions. In this paper, we present an automated camera-calibration process leveraging a dictionary-based approach that does not require prior knowledge on any camera settings. The method consists of a custom implementation of a Spatial Transformer Network (STN) and a novel topological loss function. Experiments reveal that the proposed method improves the IoU metric by up to 12% w.r.t. a state-of-the-art model across five synthetic datasets and the World Cup 2014 dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "监控视频和图像被广泛用于各种应用，从交通分析到犯罪检测。对于大多数分析应用，外部相机校准数据都是重要的。然而，安全摄像头容易受到环境条件和小型相机移动的影响，因此需要一种自动重新校准的方法来应对这些不同的情况。在本文中，我们提出了一种利用基于字典的方法来实现的自动相机校准过程，该方法不需要任何摄像机设置的先验知识。该方法包括定制的空间转换网络（STN）的实现和一种新颖的拓扑损失函数。实验结果表明，相对于现有技术模型，所提出的方法在五个综合数据集和2014年世界杯数据集上能够提高IoU度量指标高达12%。",
