    "abstract": "Motion prediction is a challenging task for autonomous vehicles due to uncertainty in the sensor data, the non-deterministic nature of future, and complex behavior of agents. In this paper, we tackle this problem by representing the scene as dynamic occupancy grid maps (DOGMs), associating semantic labels to the occupied cells and incorporating map information. We propose a novel framework that combines deep-learning-based spatio-temporal and probabilistic approaches to predict vehicle behaviors.Contrary to the conventional OGM prediction methods, evaluation of our work is conducted against the ground truth annotations. We experiment and validate our results on real-world NuScenes dataset and show that our model shows superior ability to predict both static and dynamic vehicles compared to OGM predictions. Furthermore, we perform an ablation study and assess the role of semantic labels and map in the architecture.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于传感器数据的不确定性、未来的非确定性和代理行为的复杂性，运动预测对于自动驾驶车辆来说是一项具有挑战性的任务。本文通过将场景表示为动态占据网格地图（DOGMs），将语义标签与占据的单元格关联，并结合地图信息来解决这个问题。我们提出了一个新颖的框架，将基于深度学习的时空和概率方法相结合，预测车辆行为。与传统的OGM预测方法相反，我们的工作是根据真实注释进行评估的。我们在真实世界的NuScenes数据集上进行实验和验证，并展示了我们的模型在预测静态和动态车辆方面与OGM预测相比具有优越的能力。此外，我们还进行了消融研究，评估了语义标签和地图在架构中的作用。",
