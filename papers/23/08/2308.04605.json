In this paper, we propose PSRFlow, a novel normalizing flow-based generative model for scientific data super-resolution that incorporates uncertainty quantification into the super-resolution process.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管近年来提出了许多基于深度学习的超分辨率方法，但由于推理阶段缺乏真值，很少能够量化超分辨结果的误差和不确定性。然而，对于科学可视化应用来说，将结果的不确定性传达给科学家是至关重要的，以避免生成误导或错误的信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于流式模型的生成模型PSRFlow，用于科学数据超分辨率，并将不确定性量化融入到超分辨过程中。PSRFlow基于低分辨率数据学习高分辨率数据的条件分布。通过从高分辨率数据中捕获的缺失信息的高斯潜在空间进行采样，可以生成不同的可行超分辨率输出。在高斯潜在空间中进行高效采样使得我们的模型能够进行不确定性量化。",
