    "translated_abstract": "点击率预测在推荐系统和在线广告等应用中至关重要，它基于用户点击的可能性对项目进行排序。用户行为序列建模在点击率预测中取得了进展，它从用户的历史行为序列中提取潜在兴趣，以实现准确的点击率预测。最近的研究探索使用隐式反馈序列（例如未点击的记录）来提取多样化的用户兴趣。然而，这些方法面临两个关键挑战：1）由于序列时间范围不同而导致的时间错位，以及2）缺乏对反馈序列之间的细粒度交互的建模。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的框架TEM4CTR，该框架确保序列之间的时间对齐，同时利用辅助反馈信息通过表示投影机制增强项目级的点击行为。此外，该基于投影的信息传递模块可以更**/",
