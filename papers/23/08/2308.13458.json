    "translated_abstract": "对于许多公民来说，复杂的文本是获取公共信息和知识的主要障碍。而文本简化是一项重要的自然语言处理任务，旨在减少文本的语言复杂性，同时保留原始含义。最近，生成式人工智能（AI）的进展使得自动文本简化成为可能，无论是在词汇还是句法层面上。然而，由于应用通常集中在英语上，对于荷兰语等低资源语言上应用生成式AI技术的有效性了解甚少。出于这个原因，我们进行了实证研究，以了解将生成式技术应用于文本简化的益处和局限，并提供以下结果：1）一个可配置的文本简化流程的设计和实施，将最先进的生成式文本简化模型、领域和读者适应性以及可视化模块结合在一起；2）ins",
