    "abstract": "Solar flare forecasting research using machine learning (ML) has focused on high resolution magnetogram data from the SDO/HMI era covering Solar Cycle 24 and the start of Solar Cycle 25, with some efforts looking back to SOHO/MDI for data from Solar Cycle 23. In this paper, we consider over 4 solar cycles of daily historical magnetogram data from multiple instruments. This is the first attempt to take advantage of this historical data for ML-based flare forecasting. We apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from full-disk magnetograms together with a logistic regression model to incorporate scalar features based on magnetograms and flaring history. We use an ensemble approach to generate calibrated probabilistic forecasts of M-class or larger flares in the next 24 hours. Overall, we find that including historical data improves forecasting skill and reliability. We show that single frame magnetograms do not contain significantly more relevant information than can",

    "translated_abstract": "使用机器学习进行太阳耀斑预测的研究集中在SDO/HMI时代覆盖太阳第24个周日和第25个周日开始的高分辨率磁场图数据上，一些研究还回顾了来自太阳第23个周日的SOHO/MDI数据。在本文中，我们考虑了来自多个仪器的历时4个太阳周期的每日历史磁场图数据。这是首次尝试利用这些历史数据进行基于机器学习的耀斑预测。我们使用卷积神经网络（CNN）从全球磁场图中提取特征，并结合逻辑回归模型将基于磁场图和耀斑历史的标量特征纳入模型。我们采用集成方法生成在接下来的24小时内M级或更大耀斑的校准概率预测。总体而言，我们发现包含历史数据可以提高耀斑预测的准确性和可靠性。我们还展示了单帧磁场图并不包含比我们的模型能够提供的更多相关信息。",
