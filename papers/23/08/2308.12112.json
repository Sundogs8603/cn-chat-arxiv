    "translated_abstract": "大多数持续学习（CL）方法推动着监督学习设置的极限，其中一个智能体期望学习新的标记任务而不会忘记先前的知识。然而，这些设置与现实生活场景不太吻合，其中学习智能体可以访问大量的无标记数据，包括全新（完全无标记）类别和已知类别的示例。受到广义类别发现（GCD）的启发，我们引入了一个新的框架来放松这个假设。确切地说，在任何任务中，我们允许存在新的和已知的类别，并且必须使用持续版本的无监督学习方法来发现它们。我们称这种设置为广义持续类别发现（GCCD）。它统一了CL和GCD，弥合了合成基准和现实生活场景之间的差距。通过一系列实验，我们发现现有的方法无法从后续任务中积累知识，其中包含无标记样本。",
