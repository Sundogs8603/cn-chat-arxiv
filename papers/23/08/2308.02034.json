    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了电动自行车（电单车）及其对美国政策制定者的影响。电动自行车作为一种快速和环保的交通选择，已经获得了显著的流行。在我们追求可持续能源计划的过程中，了解电动自行车的增长和影响对政策制定者至关重要。我们的数学模型为电动自行车的价值和其在未来的角色提供了洞察。我们使用ARIMA模型，一种监督式的机器学习算法，预测了美国电动自行车销量的增长。我们的模型基于从2006年1月到2022年12月的历史销售数据进行训练，预测2025年销售量为130万辆，2028年销售量为211.3万辆。为了评估影响电动自行车使用的因素，我们采用了随机森林回归模型。影响电动自行车销量增长最显著的因素是可支配个人收入和受欢迎程度。此外，我们还研究了电动自行车对环境和健康的影响。",
