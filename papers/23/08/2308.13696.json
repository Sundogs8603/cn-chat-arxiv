    "translated_abstract": "束搜索和穷举搜索是文本解码算法中深度搜索的两个极端。束搜索在搜索宽度和深度上都有限制，而穷举搜索是全局搜索，没有这些限制。令人惊讶的是，尽管束搜索的搜索误差较高，但它不仅计算成本更低，而且表现更好。许多研究对一系列不同的束宽度进行了调查，并报告称既不太大也不太小的束宽度是理想的。然而，在搜索深度方面，只有束搜索和穷举搜索这两个极端得到了深入研究。在本文中，我们研究了介于两个极端之间的一系列搜索深度，以发现理想的搜索深度。为此，我们引入了前瞻束搜索（LBS），这是一种多步前瞻搜索，通过考虑未来固定步数来优化目标。束搜索和穷举搜索是特殊情况。",

Despite its higher search error, beam search outperforms exhaustive search in terms of computational cost and performance."
