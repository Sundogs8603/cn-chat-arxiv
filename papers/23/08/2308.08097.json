    "translated_abstract": "现有的应用Mixup技术于图中的研究主要集中在图分类任务上，而节点分类的研究仍未深入探索。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的节点分类Mixup增强方法，称为结构Mixup（S-Mixup）。其核心思想是在混合节点时考虑结构信息。具体而言，S-Mixup通过图神经网络（GNN）分类器获得图中未标记节点的伪标签和预测置信度。这些伪标签和置信度作为构成跨类和内类Mixup的Mixup池的标准。此外，我们利用GNN训练中获得的边梯度，并提出了一种基于梯度的边选择策略，用于选择连接到Mixup生成的节点的边。通过对真实世界基准数据集的大量实验证明了S-Mixup在节点分类任务上的有效性。我们观察到S-Mixup在节点分类任务上的效果。",
