    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶车辆（AV）的道德问题近年来受到了很多关注，特别是在涉及到人类伤害的事故情况下的决策政策方面。在讨论“人工道德代理”一词是否适用于描述能够做出这些决策的AV之后，并基于一种假设，即在某些情况下无法避免人类伤害，提出了一种AV决策制定策略，只使用预定义的参数来表征可能发生事故的风险，并将伦理倾向理论纳入多种可能的决策规则中，以确定在特定环境和决策背景下最合适的行动。这种方法的目标不是定义道德理论要求车辆如何行为，而是提供一种灵活的计算方法，能够适应各种情况。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a strategy for decision-making in automated driving that utilizes pre-defined parameters to assess the risk of accidents and integrates ethical valence theory. The goal is to provide a flexible computational approach that adapts to different environments and decision contexts, rather than prescribing moral requirements for vehicle behavior."
