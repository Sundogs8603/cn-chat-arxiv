    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality. Breast cancer patients in developing countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and South America, suffer from the highest mortality rate in the world. One crucial factor contributing to the global disparity in mortality rate is long delay of diagnosis due to a severe shortage of trained pathologists, which consequently has led to a large proportion of late-stage presentation at diagnosis. The delay between the initial development of symptoms and the receipt of a diagnosis could stretch upwards 15 months. To tackle this critical healthcare disparity, this research has developed a deep learning-based diagnosis system for metastatic breast cancer that can achieve high diagnostic accuracy as well as computational efficiency.

    "translated_abstract": "乳腺癌是癌症死亡的主要原因之一。发展中国家，特别是撒哈拉以南非洲、南亚和南美的乳腺癌患者死亡率最高。导致全球死亡率差距的关键因素之一是由于受训病理学家严重短缺而导致的诊断长时间延迟，从而导致诊断时较大比例的晚期表现。初始症状发展到诊断接受时间可能长达15个月。为解决这一关键的医疗差距，本研究开发了一种基于深度学习的转移性乳腺癌诊断系统，既能达到高诊断准确度，又能保证计算效率。根据我们的评估，基于MobileNetV2的诊断模型在诊断准确度、模型泛化性和模型训练方面超过了更复杂的VGG16、ResNet50和ResNet101模型。",
