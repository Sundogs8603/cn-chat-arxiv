    "translated_abstract": "在图挖掘中，发现密集子图是一个核心问题，广泛应用于不同领域。同时，许多现实世界的网络随时间变化，即数据集可以表示为图快照的序列。因此，自然而然地考虑到在允许一定程度的时间变化的情况下，找到密集子图的问题。在本文中，我们搜索具有较大Jaccard相似性系数的密集子图。更正式地说，给定一组图快照和权重λ，我们寻找一组密集子图，使得感应子图的密度之和加上以λ加权的Jaccard指数之和最大化。我们证明了该问题是NP困难的。为了发现具有良好目标值的密集子图，我们提出了一个迭代算法，每次迭代时间复杂度为$\\mathcal{O}(n^2k^2 + m \\log n + k^3 n)$，和一个贪婪算法，时间复杂度为$\\mathcal{O}(n^2k^2 + m \\log n)$。",
