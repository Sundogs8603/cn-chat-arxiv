We then discuss why exemplary organizations in different industries, including industry consortia, established banks, public authorities, and data-intensive SMEs might consider different approaches to \\ac{FL}.

    "translated_abstract": "在许多行业中，数据共享的限制性规则导致联邦学习的发展。联邦学习是一种机器学习技术，允许分布式客户端合作训练模型，而无需与他人共享其各自的训练数据。本文首先探讨了联邦学习的技术基础和潜在应用。其次，我们提出了一个用于采用联邦学习的概念框架，将组织按照其人工智能能力和环境进行了映射。然后，我们讨论了为什么不同行业的典型组织，包括行业联盟、建立银行、公共机构和数据密集型中小企业可能考虑不同的联邦学习方法。最后，我们认为联邦学习为商业和信息系统工程学界提供了充满跨学科研究机会的机构转变。",
