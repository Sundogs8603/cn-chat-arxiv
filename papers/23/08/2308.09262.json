    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种基于多任务伪标签学习（MPL）的非侵入式语音质量评估模型MTQ-Net。MPL由两个阶段组成：从预训练模型中获取伪标签分数和执行多任务学习。评估目标是三个3QUEST指标，即语音MOS（S-MOS），噪声MOS（N-MOS）和通用MOS（G-MOS）。预训练的MOSA-Net模型被用来估计三个伪标签：主观评估语音质量（PESQ），短时客观可懂性（STOI）和语音失真指数（SDI）。然后利用多任务学习通过结合有监督损失（通过估计分数与真实标签之间的差异导出）和半监督损失（通过估计分数与伪标签之间的差异导出）来训练MTQ-Net，其中使用Huber损失函数作为损失函数。实验结果首先证明了MPL相较于从头训练模型的优势。",
