    "abstract": "These lecture notes represent supplementary material for a short course on time series econometrics and network econometrics. We give emphasis on limit theory for time series regression models as well as the use of the local-to-unity parametrization when modeling time series nonstationarity. Moreover, we present various non-asymptotic theory results for moderate deviation principles when considering the eigenvalues of covariance matrices as well as asymptotics for unit root moderate deviations in nonstationary autoregressive processes. Although not all applications from the literature are covered we also discuss some open problems in nonstationary time series econometrics and network econometrics.",

    "translated_abstract": "这些讲座笔记是一门关于时间序列计量经济学和网络计量经济学的短期课程的补充资料。我们强调时间序列回归模型的极限理论，以及在建模时间序列非平稳性时使用的局部到一致性参数化方法。此外，我们还介绍了在考虑协方差矩阵的特征值时的适度偏差原则的各种非渐近理论结果，以及非平稳自回归过程中单位根适度偏差的渐近理论。虽然并未涵盖文献中的所有应用，但我们还讨论了非平稳时间序列计量经济学和网络计量经济学中的一些开放问题。",
