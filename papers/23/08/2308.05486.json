By considering all quantiles, we assess how perturbations in one variable's quantile lead to changes in the distribution of the other variable. We demonstrate the construction of this relationship through a system of linear quantile regressions. The proposed framework is exploited to examine the distributional effects of money growth on the distributions of inflation and its disaggregate measures in the United States and the Euro area. Our empirical analysis uncovers significant impacts of the upper quantile of the money growth distribution on the distribution of inflation and its disaggregate measures. Conversely, we find that the lower and median quantiles of the money growth distribution have a negligible influence on the distribution of inflation and its disaggregate measures.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种构建通胀和货币增长的分位依赖系统的替代方法。通过考虑所有分位数，我们评估一个变量的分位扰动如何导致另一个变量的分布发生变化。我们通过一种线性分位数回归系统来展示这种关系的构建。我们利用提出的框架来研究货币增长对美国和欧元区通胀及其细分衡量指标分布的分配效应。我们的实证分析发现，货币增长分布的上分位数对通胀及其细分衡量指标的分布具有显著影响。相反，我们发现货币增长分布的下分位数和中位数对通胀及其细分衡量指标的分布几乎没有影响。",
