    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了将端到端深度学习工具作为有限元方法(FEM)的更有效替代品来预测动脉壁二维横截面内的应力和应变场的潜力。我们首先提出了基于U-Net的全卷积神经网络(CNN)，根据动脉壁横截面中钙化的空间排列来预测von Mises应力和应变分布。进一步，我们开发了一个条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)，从感知角度特别是增强了应力和应变场地图对于具有不同钙化数量和空间配置的动脉壁的预测准确性。在U-Net和cGAN之上，我们还分别提出了它们的集成方法，进一步提高了场地图的预测准确性。我们的数据集由实施边界条件并提取应力和应变场地图而生成的输入图像和输出图像组成。经过训练的U-Net模型可以准确地预测动脉壁的应力和应变分布。",
