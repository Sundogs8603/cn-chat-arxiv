    "abstract": "Lung cancer and covid-19 have one of the highest morbidity and mortality rates in the world. For physicians, the identification of lesions is difficult in the early stages of the disease and time-consuming. Therefore, multi-task learning is an approach to extracting important features, such as lesions, from small amounts of medical data because it learns to generalize better. We propose a novel multi-task framework for classification, segmentation, reconstruction, and detection. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones who added detection to the multi-task solution. Additionally, we checked the possibility of using two different backbones and different loss functions in the segmentation task.",
