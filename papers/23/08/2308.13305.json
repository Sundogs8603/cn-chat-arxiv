    "translated_abstract": "在类增量学习中，演练策略被广泛用于减轻灾难性遗忘问题，通过保留先前任务的有限范例。由于旧类和新类之间样本数量不平衡，分类器学习可能会产生偏差。现有的类增量学习方法利用长尾识别技术来处理增量任务中的数据不平衡问题，例如调整的损失和数据重新取样方法。本文展示了类增量学习中数据不平衡的动态性，并提出了一种新颖的动态剩余分类器（DRC）来应对这种具有挑战性的情景。具体而言，DRC建立在最近的先进剩余分类器之上，通过分支层合并来处理模型增长问题。此外，DRC与不同的类增量学习流程兼容，并且显著改进了它们。将DRC与模型适应和融合（MAF）流程相结合，该方法在传统CI方面取得了最先进的结果。",
