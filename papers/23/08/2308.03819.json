    "translated_abstract": "图上的扩散现象是普遍而重要的，例如谣言传播、类似流感病毒的传播、智能电网故障等。理解流动行为是一项艰巨的任务，因为种子的分布、传播模型和图的拓扑之间存在复杂的相互作用。网络研究涵盖了数学、物理、社会科学和计算机科学等多个学科领域。这种跨学科的特性使得网络研究具有高度专业化和分割，由此带来的合作是不足够的。从机器学习的角度来看，目前缺乏一个统一的平台来评估不同领域的算法。当前研究在该领域的一个主要障碍是缺乏一个全面的策划好的基准测试套件来研究流动行为。",
    "tldr": "XFlow是一种在图上评估流行为的基准测试方法，解决了流动行为的理解和算法评估的问题。",
