    "abstract": "This research aims to improve the accuracy of complex volleyball predictions and provide more meaningful insights to coaches and players. We introduce a specialized graph encoding technique to add additional contact-by-contact volleyball context to an already available volleyball dataset without any additional data gathering. We demonstrate the potential benefits of using graph neural networks (GNNs) on this enriched dataset for three different volleyball prediction tasks: rally outcome prediction, set location prediction, and hit type prediction. We compare the performance of our graph-based models to baseline models and analyze the results to better understand the underlying relationships in a volleyball rally. Our results show that the use of GNNs with our graph encoding yields a much more advanced analysis of the data, which noticeably improves prediction results overall. We also show that these baseline tasks can be significantly improved with simple adjustments, such as removing ",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在提高复杂排球预测的准确性，并为教练和球员提供更有意义的见解。我们引入了一种专门的图编码技术，在已有排球数据集的基础上，无需额外的数据收集，为每次接触添加附加的排球上下文。我们展示了在这个丰富的数据集上使用图神经网络（GNN）进行三种不同的排球预测任务：回合结果预测、局位置预测和击球类型预测的潜在好处。我们比较了基于图的模型与基准模型的性能，并分析了结果，以更好地理解排球攻防中的潜在关系。我们的结果表明，在结合图编码的情况下使用GNN可明显提高数据的分析水平，从而总体上提高预测结果。我们还表明，通过简单的调整，如移除某些特征，能够显著改善这些基准任务。",
