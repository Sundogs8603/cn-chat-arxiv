    "translated_abstract": "Pearl和Verma开发了d-分离，作为一种广泛使用的图形准则，用于推理由贝叶斯网络的因果结构所暗示的条件独立性。由于无环的基于概率的逻辑程序对应于其依赖图上的贝叶斯网络，因此我们可以从后者的d-分离中计算条件独立性。在本文中，我们将上述推理推广到非ground情况。首先，我们将概率逻辑程序的概念抽象出来，摒弃外部数据库和概率，得到所谓的程序结构。然后，我们提出了一个正确的元解释器，用于判断在给定外部数据库上是否由程序结构进一步暗示了某个特定的条件独立性陈述。最后，我们给出了程序结构的一个片段，对于这个片段，我们得到了一个关于条件独立性预言的完备性陈述。我们通过实验评估我们的方法，揭示了我们的元解释器的性能。",
