    "translated_abstract": "使用脑电图（EEG）进行情绪识别主要有两种情况：离散标签的分类和连续标记的回归。尽管已经提出了许多用于分类任务的算法，但对于回归任务只有少数方法。对于情绪回归，标签在时间上是连续的。一个自然的方法是学习时态动态模式。在先前的研究中，长短期记忆网络（LSTM）和时间卷积神经网络（TCN）被用来学习EEG特征向量的时间背景信息。然而，EEG的空间模式没有被有效提取出来。为了使TCN在回归和分类性能上具有更好的空间学习能力，我们提出了一种新的统一模型，名为MASA-TCN，用于EEG情绪回归和分类任务。空间感知时间层使得TCN能够从EEG电极之间的空间关系中进行额外的学习。",
