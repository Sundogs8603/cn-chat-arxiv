    "translated_abstract": "交通预测是智能交通系统中的重要服务。利用深度模型解决这一任务，严重依赖于交通传感器或车辆设备的数据，然而一些城市可能缺乏设备支持，因此可用的数据较少。因此，有必要从数据丰富的城市中学习，并将知识转移给数据稀缺的城市，以提高交通预测的性能。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种通过交通模式存储库来进行跨城市少样本交通预测的框架，因为交通模式在不同城市间是相似的。交通模式存储库利用预训练的交通补丁编码器将数据丰富的城市的原始交通数据投影到高维空间，通过聚类生成交通模式存储库。然后，数据稀缺城市的交通数据可以查询交通模式存储库，并构建它们之间的显式关系。基于这些关系，元知识被聚合起来。",
