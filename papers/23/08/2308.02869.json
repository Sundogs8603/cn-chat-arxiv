    "translated_abstract": "在现代诊断技术领域，视频胶囊内镜(VCE)因其在诊断各种胃肠道疾病，包括隐性出血等方面的高效性和非侵入性而脱颖而出。对于成功诊断和治疗这些疾病，准确识别VCE图像中的出血区域至关重要。虽然基于深度学习的方法已经成为VCE图像自动分析的强大工具，但它们通常需要大量具有全面标注的训练数据集。获取这些标记数据集往往耗时、昂贵，并且需要丰富的领域专业知识。为了解决这个问题，我们采用了半监督学习(SSL)方法来对VCE中的出血区域进行分割。通过采用“平均教师”方法，我们构建了一个配备了scSE注意力模块的学生U-Net模型，以及一个相同架构的教师模型。这些模型的参数是交替更新的。",
