    "abstract": "Embedding learning transforms discrete data entities into continuous numerical representations, encoding features/properties of the entities. Despite the outstanding performance reported from different embedding learning algorithms, few efforts were devoted to structurally interpreting how features are encoded in the learned embedding space. This work proposes EmbeddingTree, a hierarchical embedding exploration algorithm that relates the semantics of entity features with the less-interpretable embedding vectors. An interactive visualization tool is also developed based on EmbeddingTree to explore high-dimensional embeddings. The tool helps users discover nuance features of data entities, perform feature denoising/injecting in embedding training, and generate embeddings for unseen entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of EmbeddingTree and our visualization tool through embeddings generated for industry-scale merchant data and the public 30Music listening/playlists dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "嵌入学习将离散的数据实体转换为连续的数值表示，编码了实体的特征/属性。尽管有多种嵌入学习算法报告了出色的性能，但很少有工作投入到对学习到的嵌入空间中的特征如何编码的结构解释。本文提出了EmbeddingTree，一种层次嵌入探索算法，将实体特征的语义与较难解释的嵌入向量相关联。还开发了一种基于EmbeddingTree的交互式可视化工具来探索高维嵌入。该工具可帮助用户发现数据实体的微妙特征，在嵌入训练中执行特征去噪/注入，并为未见实体生成嵌入。我们通过对工业规模的商户数据和公共的30Music听歌/播放列表数据集生成的嵌入来证明EmbeddingTree和我们的可视化工具的有效性。",
