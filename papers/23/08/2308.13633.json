    "abstract": "Neurons in early sensory areas rapidly adapt to changing sensory statistics, both by normalizing the variance of their individual responses and by reducing correlations between their responses. Together, these transformations may be viewed as an adaptive form of statistical whitening. Existing mechanistic models of adaptive whitening exclusively use either synaptic plasticity or gain modulation as the biological substrate for adaptation; however, on their own, each of these models has significant limitations. In this work, we unify these approaches in a normative multi-timescale mechanistic model that adaptively whitens its responses with complementary computational roles for synaptic plasticity and gain modulation. Gains are modified on a fast timescale to adapt to the current statistical context, whereas synapses are modified on a slow timescale to learn structural properties of the input statistics that are invariant across contexts. Our model is derived from a novel multi-timescale",

    "translated_abstract": "早期感觉区的神经元能够迅速适应变化的感觉统计信息，通过对其个体响应的方差进行归一化以及减少响应之间的相关性。这些转换可以被视为一种自适应的白化过程。现有的自适应白化的机制模型只使用突触可塑性或增益调制作为适应的生物基质，然而，每个模型都有显著的局限性。在这项工作中，我们将这些方法统一起来，提出了一个规范性的多时间尺度机制模型，通过突触可塑性和增益调制的计算角色来自适应地进行白化。增益在快速时间尺度上根据当前的统计情况进行调整，而突触在慢速时间尺度上进行调整，学习输入统计中与情境无关的结构特性。我们的模型来自于一种新颖的多时间尺度",
