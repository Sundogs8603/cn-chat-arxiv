    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种支持容量评估和医院病例组合规划的分析技术和决策支持工具。首先，提出了一个优化模型，用于分析对已有病例组合进行修改的影响。该模型确定了在医院资源可用性发生变化时，其他患者类型应按比例进行修改的方式。然后，我们提出了多目标决策技术，用于比较和评价获得的竞争性病例组合解决方案。所提出的技术无缝嵌入在Excel的Visual Basic for Applications（VBA）个人决策支持工具（PDST）中，用于对医院容量进行信息量化评估。PDST报告了不同指标的差异信息，并报告了病例组合修改对其他患者类型的影响。本文开发的技术为当前理论和实践之间建立了桥梁。",
