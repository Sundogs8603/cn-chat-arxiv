    "abstract": "We present the concept of ordered majority rule, a property of Instant Runoff Voting, and compare it to the familiar concept of pairwise majority rule of Condorcet methods. Ordered majority rule establishes a social order among the candidates such that that relative order between any two candidates is determined by voters who do not prefer another major candidate. It ensures the election of a candidate from the majority party or coalition while preventing an antagonistic opposition party or coalition from influencing which candidate that may be. We show how IRV is the only voting method to satisfy ordered majority rule, for a self-consistently determined distinction between major and minor candidates, and that ordered majority rule is incompatible with the properties of Condorcet compliance, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and monotonicity. Finally, we present some arguments as to why ordered majority rule may be preferable to pairwise majority rule, using the 2022 Alaska spec",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了有序多数规则的概念，它是即时投票的一个特性，并将其与康多塞方法的成对多数规则进行了比较。有序多数规则在候选人中建立一种社会顺序，使得相对顺序由不倾向于其他主要候选人的选民决定。它确保了从多数党或联盟中选出一位候选人，并防止对立的反对党或联盟对可能成为候选人的选择产生影响。我们展示了即时投票是唯一满足有序多数规则的投票方法，对主要候选人和次要候选人进行了自洽确定，并且有序多数规则与康多塞合规性、无关因素的独立性和单调性等特性不兼容。最后，我们提出了一些关于为什么有序多数规则可能优于成对多数规则的论点，利用到2022年阿拉斯加的案例。",
