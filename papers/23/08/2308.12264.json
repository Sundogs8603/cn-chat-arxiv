    "translated_abstract": "随着深度学习模型的使用、规模和复杂性增加，其能源消耗迅速增长已成为一个关键问题。促进绿色发展和不同粒度的能源意识，以限制深度学习系统的碳排放是当务之急。然而，缺乏准确测量和优化细粒度（例如方法级别）能耗的标准和可重复工具阻碍了该领域的进展。在本文中，我们介绍了FECoM（细粒度能耗测量仪），这是一个用于细粒度深度学习能耗测量的框架。具体而言，FECoM为研究人员和开发人员提供了一种对深度学习API进行概要分析的机制。FECoM通过使用静态仪器分析和考虑计算负载和温度稳定性等各种因素来解决细粒度能耗测量的挑战。我们评估了FECoM在最常用的深度学习模型之一上测量细粒度能耗的能力。",
