    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize the novel classes which cannot be collected for training a prediction model. Accordingly, generative models (e.g., generative adversarial network (GAN)) are typically used to synthesize the visual samples conditioned by the class semantic vectors and achieve remarkable progress for ZSL. However, existing GAN-based generative ZSL methods are based on hand-crafted models, which cannot adapt to various datasets/scenarios and fails to model instability. To alleviate these challenges, we propose evolutionary generative adversarial network search (termed EGANS) to automatically design the generative network with good adaptation and stability, enabling reliable visual feature sample synthesis for advancing ZSL. Specifically, we adopt cooperative dual evolution to conduct a neural architecture search for both generator and discriminator under a unified evolutionary adversarial framework. EGANS is learned by two stages: evolution generator architecture",

    "translated_abstract": "零样本学习（ZSL）旨在识别那些无法用于训练预测模型的新类别。因此，生成模型（例如生成对抗网络（GAN））通常被用来根据类别语义向量合成视觉样本，并在ZSL方面取得了显著进展。然而，现有基于GAN的生成ZSL方法基于手工模型，无法适应各种数据集/场景，并且无法建模不稳定性。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了进化生成对抗网络搜索（称为EGANS），以自动设计具有良好适应性和稳定性的生成网络，从而为推进ZSL提供可靠的视觉特征样本合成。具体而言，我们采用协同双重进化，在统一的进化对抗框架下进行生成器和判别器的神经架构搜索。EGANS通过两个阶段进行学习：进化生成器架构的学习阶段",
