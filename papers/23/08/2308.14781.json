    "translated_abstract": "主动有限状态机学习算法在处理观测数据中的冲突（同一输入对应不同输出）方面存在困难。这种固有的冲突恢复能力不足，影响了它们在存在噪声或学习中的系统变化场景中的有效应用。我们提出了冲突感知的主动有限状态机学习（C3AL）框架，以在学习过程中处理冲突信息。核心思想是将所谓的观测树视为学习过程的一等公民。尽管这个想法在最近的研究中得到了探索，但我们通过将其与任何现有的学习算法结合，并在面对冲突时最小化对正在学习的系统执行的测试次数，充分发挥了它的作用。我们在大量的基准测试中评估了C3AL，涵盖了30多个不同的真实目标和18,000多个不同的场景。评估结果表明，C3AL是一个合适的替代方法。",
