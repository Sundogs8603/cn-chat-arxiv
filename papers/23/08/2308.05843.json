    "translated_abstract": "通过求解 Helmholtz 方程计算地震波场对许多实际应用至关重要，如全波形反演。物理信息神经网络（PINN）用神经网络（NN）表示波场解的函数形式，但其收敛速度慢。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种改进的 PINN 方法，使用乘法滤波网络，在训练中嵌入了一些波场的已知特性，例如频率，以实现更快的收敛。具体而言，我们使用 Gabor 基函数，因为其已被证明能够准确表示波场，并将其实现称为 GaborPINN。同时，我们将波场频率的先验信息纳入方法的设计中，以减轻 GaborPINN 表示的波场的不连续性的影响。与传统 PINN 方法相比，所提出的方法实现了收敛速度高达两个数量级的提升。",
