    "translated_abstract": "深度学习在涉及人类颅骨的各种医疗应用中具有潜力，但需要大量经过策划的医学图像数据集。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了SkullGAN，一种生成对抗网络（GAN），用于创建大规模的合成颅骨CT切片数据集，减少对真实图像的依赖并加速将机器学习应用于医疗保健领域的整合。在我们的方法中，对38个受试者进行了颅骨CT切片输入SkullGAN，这是一个包含超过2亿个参数的神经网络。生成的合成颅骨图像根据三个定量放射学特征进行评估：颅骨密度比（SDR）、平均厚度和平均强度。同时，使用t-分布随机邻域嵌入（t-SNE）进行进一步的分析，并将SkullGAN判别器作为分类器进行应用。结果表明，SkullGAN生成的图像与真实颅骨具有类似的关键定量放射学特征。进一步的确定性分析是通过进行了解决这个问题的办法。",
