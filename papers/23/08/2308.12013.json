    "translated_abstract": "通过机器学习技术实现的生成模型是从有限的训练样本中推断出复杂和未知数据分布并产生新的合成数据的强大工具。扩散模型是一种新兴的框架，最近在创建合成文本和高质量图像方面已经超越了生成对抗性网络的性能。在这里，我们提出并讨论了扩散模型的量子推generalization，即三种可能在实际量子系统上进行实验的量子噪声驱动的生成扩散模型。我们的想法是利用独特的量子特性，特别是目前可用的有噪声量子处理器不可避免地受到的相干性、纠缠性和噪声之间的非平凡相互作用，以克服传统扩散模型在推断过程中的主要计算负担。因此，我们建议将量子噪声不作为需要检测和解决的问题，而是作为一种可利用的特性，使得扩散模型能够更好地工作。",
