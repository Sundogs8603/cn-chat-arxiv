    "abstract": "We present a general framework for unsupervised text style transfer with deep generative models. The framework models each sentence-label pair in the non-parallel corpus as partially observed from a complete quadruplet which additionally contains two latent codes representing the content and style, respectively. These codes are learned by exploiting dependencies inside the observed data. Then a sentence is transferred by manipulating them. Our framework is able to unify previous embedding and prototype methods as two special forms. It also provides a principled perspective to explain previously proposed techniques in the field such as aligned encoder and adversarial training. We further conduct experiments on three benchmarks. Both automatic and human evaluation results show that our methods achieve better or competitive results compared to several strong baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种使用深度生成模型实现无监督文本风格转换的通用框架。该框架将非平行语料中的每个句子-标签对建模为一个部分观测的完整四元组，该四元组还包含表示内容和风格的两个潜在编码。这些编码通过利用观测数据内部的依赖关系来进行学习。然后通过操纵这些编码来实现句子的转换。我们的框架能够将以前的嵌入和原型方法统一为两个特殊形式。它还提供了一种原理性的观点来解释领域中先前提出的技术，如对齐编码器和对抗训练。我们进一步在三个基准测试上进行了实验证明。自动评估和人工评估结果表明，与几个强基线方法相比，我们的方法取得了更好或具有竞争力的结果。",
