    "abstract": "The groundbreaking invention of ChatGPT has triggered enormous discussion among users across all fields and domains. Among celebration around its various advantages, questions have been raised with regards to its correctness and ethics of its use. Efforts are already underway towards capturing user sentiments around it. But it begs the question as to how the research community is analyzing ChatGPT with regards to various aspects of its usage. It is this sentiment of the researchers that we analyze in our work. Since Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis has usually only been applied on a few datasets, it gives limited success and that too only on short text data. We propose a methodology that uses Explainable AI to facilitate such analysis on research data. Our technique presents valuable insights into extending the state of the art of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis on newer datasets, where such analysis is not hampered by the length of the text data.",

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT的创新性发明在各个领域引发了广泛的讨论。尽管庆祝其各种优点，但对其正确性和使用伦理产生了疑问。已经在努力捕捉用户对其的情感，但如何分析研究界关于ChatGPT不同使用方面的情感是一个值得探讨的问题。在标准的面向方面情感分析中，通常只应用于少量数据集，并且在短文本数据上仅获得有限的成功。我们提出了一种方法，利用可解释的人工智能来促进对研究数据的分析。我们的技术为在新数据集上拓展面向方面情感分析的最新技术提供了宝贵的洞见，使得这种分析不受文本数据长度的限制。",
