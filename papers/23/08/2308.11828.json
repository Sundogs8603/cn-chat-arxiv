    "abstract": "We study a reinsurer who faces multiple sources of model uncertainty. The reinsurer offers contracts to $n$ insurers whose claims follow different compound Poisson processes. As the reinsurer is uncertain about the insurers' claim severity distributions and frequencies, they design reinsurance contracts that maximise their expected wealth subject to an entropy penalty. Insurers meanwhile seek to maximise their expected utility without ambiguity. We solve this continuous-time Stackelberg game for general reinsurance contracts and find that the reinsurer prices under a distortion of the barycentre of the insurers' models. We apply our results to proportional reinsurance and excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts, and illustrate the solutions numerically. Furthermore, we solve the related problem where the reinsurer maximises, still under ambiguity, their expected utility and compare the solutions.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一家面临多个模型不确定性的再保险商。再保险商向$n$家保险商提供合同，其索赔遵循不同的复合泊松过程。由于再保险商对于保险商的索赔严重程度分布和频率存在不确定性，他们设计了最大化预期财富的再保险合同，同时还需要承担一个熵惩罚。而保险商则寻求在无歧义的情况下最大化他们的预期效用。我们解决了这个连续时间的领导者-追随者博弈问题，得到再保险商在保险商模型的重心失真下的定价方式。我们将这些结果应用到比例再保险和超额损失再保险合同，并进行了数值解析。此外，我们还解决了再保险商在模糊情况下最大化他们的预期效用的相关问题，并比较了解的不同。",
