    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习（ML）的爆炸性增长，特别是在新兴的大语言模型（LLM）的背景下，理解其内部工作中的语义意义至关重要。虽然因果分析侧重于定义语义及其量化，基于梯度的方法是可解释的人工智能（XAI）的核心，用于解释黑盒子的解释。通过协同这些方法，探索模型的内部机制如何阐明其因果效应已成为基于证据的决策的必要条件。一系列并行的研究表明，交叉性--个体的多个人口统计学因素的组合影响--可以以平均处理效应（ATE）的形式进行结构化。最初，本研究阐述了仇恨迷因检测问题可以作为一个ATE来描述，借助交叉性原则，以及基于模态的梯度注意力的摘要化。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the application of causal intersectionality and dual form of gradient descent in multimodal analysis, with a case study on hateful memes detection. By combining causal analysis and gradient-based methods, the study reveals how a model's internal mechanisms can illuminate its causal effect, and introduces a modality-wise summarization of gradient-based attention."
