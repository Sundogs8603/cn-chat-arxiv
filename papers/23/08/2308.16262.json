When each decision maker unilaterally selects agents by maximising their own utility, we show that the optimal selection rule is a trade-off between selecting the best agents and providing incentives to maximise the agents' improvement. Furthermore, this optimal selection rule relies on incorrect predictions of agents' outcomes. Hence, we study the conditions under which a decision maker's optimal selection rule will not lead to deterioration of agents' outcome nor cause unjust reduction in agents' selection chance.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了多个决策者下的因果战略学习中的代理选择问题，并解决了其中的两个关键挑战。首先，我们考虑了由代理人评估和选择组成的选择过程的影响，而不是之前研究中关注的固定代理人池。当每个决策者通过最大化自身效用来单方面选择代理人时，我们证明了最佳的选择规则是在选择最佳代理人和提供激励以最大化代理人改进之间进行权衡的结果。此外，这个最佳选择规则依赖于代理人结果的错误预测。因此，我们研究了决策者的最佳选择规则不会导致代理人结果恶化，也不会造成不公正的降低代理人选择机会的条件。为此，我们提供了最佳选择规则的数学形式和一种实现机制。",
