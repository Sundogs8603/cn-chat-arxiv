    "translated_abstract": "最近的事件编码的监督模型在性能方面远远超过模式匹配方法。然而，它们仅仅依赖于新的注释，忽视了专家数据库中的大量知识，限制了它们在细粒度分类中的适用性。为了解决这些限制，我们通过利用已建立的注释编码本的知识，探索零样本方法用于政治事件本体关系分类。我们的研究涵盖了ChatGPT和一种新颖的基于自然语言推理的方法，名为ZSP。ZSP采用了一种树查询框架，将任务分解为上下文、语态和类别消歧的不同层次。该框架提高了解释性、效率和对模式更改的适应性。通过在我们新策划的数据集上进行大量实验，我们指出了ChatGPT中的不稳定性问题，并突出了ZSP的卓越性能。ZSP在细粒度根代码分类的F1得分上取得了令人印象深刻的提高40%。",
