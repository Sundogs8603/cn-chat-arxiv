Here, we aim to quantify the effect of miscategorization of funds utilizing a machine learning based approach. We formulate the problem of miscategorization of funds as a distance-based outlier detection problem, where the outliers are the data-points that are far from the rest of the data-points in the given feature space.

We test our implementation on various publicly available data sets, and then app",

    "translated_abstract": "互惠基金的分类已成为投资管理行业的标准工具，并被继续用于资产配置和经理选择，以及由基金经理用于同行分析和竞争定位。因此，分类错误或精度不足可能会对资产配置决策和投资基金经理产生重大影响。在这里，我们旨在利用基于机器学习的方法量化基金的分类错误影响。我们将基金的分类错误问题视为基于距离的异常检测问题，其中异常值是在给定特征空间中远离其他数据点的数据点。我们实现并使用了基于随机森林 (RF)的距离度量学习方法，并计算了每个数据点的类别异常度量，以识别数据中的异常值。我们在各种公开可用的数据集上测试了我们的实现，并进一步分析了其应用。",
