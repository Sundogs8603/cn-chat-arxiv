We present a code that successfully replicates results from six popular and recent graph recommendation models (NGCF, DGCF, LightGCN, SGL, UltraGCN, and GFCF) on three common benchmark datasets (Gowalla, Yelp 2018, and Amazon Book). Additionally, we compare these graph models with traditional collaborative filtering models that historically performed well in offline evaluations. Furthermore, we extend our study to two new datasets (Allrecipes and BookCrossing) that lack established setups in existing literature.

    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络模型（GNNs）的成功显著推动了推荐系统的发展，通过将用户和物品有效地建模为一个二分图和无向图。然而，许多原始的基于图的作品通常在未验证其在具体配置下的有效性的情况下采用基线论文的结果。我们的工作解决了这个问题，着重关注结果的可复制性。我们提出了一种成功复制了六个流行且最新的图推荐模型（NGCF、DGCF、LightGCN、SGL、UltraGCN和GFCF）在三个常见基准数据集（Gowalla、Yelp 2018和亚马逊图书）上的结果的代码。此外，我们将这些图模型与在离线评估中表现良好的传统协同过滤模型进行了比较。此外，我们还扩展了对两个缺乏现有文献中已建立设置的新数据集（Allrecipes和BookCrossing）的研究。由于在这些数据集上的性能与以前的基准数据集不同，使得我们对图推荐模型性能的评估结果更加深入和全面。",
