    "abstract": "We discuss the problem of estimating Radon-Nikodym derivatives. This problem appears in various applications, such as covariate shift adaptation, likelihood-ratio testing, mutual information estimation, and conditional probability estimation. To address the above problem, we employ the general regularization scheme in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The convergence rate of the corresponding regularized algorithm is established by taking into account both the smoothness of the derivative and the capacity of the space in which it is estimated. This is done in terms of general source conditions and the regularized Christoffel functions. We also find that the reconstruction of Radon-Nikodym derivatives at any particular point can be done with high order of accuracy. Our theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文讨论了估计Radon-Nikodym导数的问题。这个问题在各种应用中出现，比如协变量偏移适应、似然比检验、互信息估计和条件概率估计。为了解决上述问题，我们采用再生核希尔伯特空间中的一般正则化方案。通过考虑导数的平滑度和估计它的空间的容量，建立了相应正则化算法的收敛速度。这是以一般源条件和正则化的Christoffel函数为基础的。我们还发现，在任何特定点上重建Radon-Nikodym导数可以具有高精度。我们的理论结果通过数值模拟进行了说明。",
