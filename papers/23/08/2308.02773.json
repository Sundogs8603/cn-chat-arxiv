    "translated_abstract": "EduChat是一种基于大规模语言模型（LLM）的智能教育聊天机器人系统。其目标是支持个性化、公平和有同情心的智能教育，为教师、学生和家长提供服务。在心理学和教育理论的指导下，它进一步加强了基本的LLM的教育功能，如开放式问题回答，文章评估，苏格拉底式教学和情感支持。特别地，我们通过在教育语料库上预训练来学习特定领域的知识，并通过在设计的系统提示和指令上进行微调来激发各种技能。目前，EduChat作为一个开源项目在线可用，其代码、数据和模型参数可以在平台上获取（例如，GitHub https://github.com/icalk-nlp/EduChat，Hugging Face https://huggingface.co/ecnu-icalk）。我们还准备了一个在线演示其功能的视频（https://vimeo.com/851004454）。",
