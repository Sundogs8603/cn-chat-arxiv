    "abstract": "In the present time, all know about World Wide Web and work over the Internet daily. In this paper, we introduce the search engines working for keywords that are entered by users to find something. The search engine uses different search algorithms for convenient results for providing to the net surfer. Net surfers go with the top search results but how did the results of web pages get higher ranks over search engines? how the search engine got that all the web pages in the database? This paper gives the answers to all these kinds of basic questions. Web crawlers working for search engines and robot exclusion protocol rules for web crawlers are also addressed in this research paper. Webmaster uses different restriction facts in robot.txt file to instruct web crawler, some basic formats of robot.txt are also mentioned in this paper.",

    "translated_abstract": "当今，所有人都了解互联网并每天在互联网上工作。本文介绍了为用户输入的关键字进行搜索的搜索引擎。搜索引擎使用不同的搜索算法，为上网者提供方便的结果。上网者选择排名靠前的搜索结果，但是网页的排名是如何由搜索引擎确定的？搜索引擎如何获取数据库中的所有网页？本文给出了所有这些基本问题的答案。本研究论文还讨论了为搜索引擎工作的网络爬虫和网络爬虫的机器人排除协议规则。网站管理员使用robot.txt文件中的不同限制规则指导网络爬虫，本文还提到了一些基本的robot.txt格式。",
