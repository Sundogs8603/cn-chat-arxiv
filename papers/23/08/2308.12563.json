    "translated_abstract": "主流无监督异常检测算法通常在学术数据集中表现出色，但由于受到控制实验条件下的清洁训练数据的限制，它们在实际场景下的性能受到了限制。然而，在实际异常检测中，训练数据包含噪声的挑战经常被忽视。本研究在感知时间序列异常检测（TSAD）中深入研究了标签级噪声的领域。本文提出了一种新颖实用的端到端无监督TSAD方法，该方法处理训练数据中包含异常的情况下。该方法称为TSAD-C，其在训练阶段不需要访问异常标签。TSAD-C包括三个模块：一个去污器用于纠正训练数据中存在的异常（也称为噪声），一个变量依赖建模模块用于捕捉去污后数据中的长期内部和跨变量依赖关系，可以视为替代性的异常性度量方法。",
