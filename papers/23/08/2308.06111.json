    "abstract": "Auditing financial documents is a very tedious and time-consuming process. As of today, it can already be simplified by employing AI-based solutions to recommend relevant text passages from a report for each legal requirement of rigorous accounting standards. However, these methods need to be fine-tuned regularly, and they require abundant annotated data, which is often lacking in industrial environments. Hence, we present ZeroShotALI, a novel recommender system that leverages a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) in conjunction with a domain-specifically optimized transformer-based text-matching solution. We find that a two-step approach of first retrieving a number of best matching document sections per legal requirement with a custom BERT-based model and second filtering these selections using an LLM yields significant performance improvements over existing approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "审计金融文件是一个非常繁琐和耗时的过程。目前，通过使用基于人工智能的解决方案可以简化这一过程，以推荐与严格会计标准的法律要求相符的报告中的相关文本段落。然而，这些方法需要定期进行微调，并且通常在工业环境中缺乏大量的注释数据。因此，我们提出了ZeroShotALI，这是一个新颖的推荐系统，利用了最先进的大型语言模型（LLM）与领域特定的优化的基于transformer的文本匹配解决方案。我们发现，首先使用自定义BERT模型检索与法律要求相符的若干最佳匹配的文档部分，然后使用LLM对这些选择进行过滤，可以显著改善现有方法的性能。",
