    "translated_abstract": "减小模型（ROMs）被广泛用于科学计算中以处理高维系统。然而，传统的ROM方法可能只能部分捕捉到数据的固有几何特征。这些特征包括底层结构、关系和对精确建模至关重要的基本特征。为了克服这个局限性，我们提出了一个将最优传输（OT）理论和基于神经网络的方法相结合的新型ROM框架。具体而言，我们研究了以Wasserstein距离为自定义核的核Proper正交分解（kPOD）方法，并利用Sinkhorn算法高效地训练得到的神经网络（NN）。通过利用基于OT的非线性降维，所提出的框架能够捕捉数据的几何结构，这对于准确学习减少的解决方案流形至关重要。与传统的均方误差或交叉熵等度量标准相比，",
