    "translated_abstract": "现代文本到图像生成模型能够生成高质量的图像，既逼真又与文本提示相符。然而，这种质量需要付出巨大的计算成本：几乎所有这些模型都是迭代式的，需要多次运行推断，并使用大模型。这种迭代过程是为了确保图像的不同区域不仅与文本提示对齐，还与其他区域相容。本文中，我们提出了一种轻量级的方法来实现图像不同区域的相容性，使用了马尔可夫随机场（MRF）模型。这种方法能够与最近提出的Muse模型配合使用。MRF编码了不同空间位置的图像标记之间的相容性，并且使我们能够显著减少所需的Muse预测步骤。使用MRF的推断成本大大降低，并且可以通过反向传播快速学习其参数，通过对MRF进行建模。",
