    "translated_abstract": "今年，信息检索论坛(FIRE)启动了一个共享任务，用于对不同代码段的评论进行分类。这是一个二元文本分类任务，目标是确定给定代码段的评论是否相关。印度科学教育与研究院博帕尔分院(IISERB)的BioNLP-IISERB小组参与了这项任务，并为五种不同的模型提交了五种运行结果。本文介绍了这些模型的概况和在训练语料库上的其他重要发现。这些方法涉及不同的特征工程方案和文本分类技术。对于词袋模型，我们探索了不同的分类器，如随机森林、支持向量机和逻辑回归，以识别给定训练语料库中的重要特征。此外，还研究了基于预训练Transformer的模型。",
