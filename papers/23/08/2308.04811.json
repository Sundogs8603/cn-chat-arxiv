    "abstract": "The context-aware emotional reasoning ability of AI systems, especially in conversations, is of vital importance in applications such as online opinion mining from social media and empathetic dialogue systems. Due to the implicit nature of conveying emotions in many scenarios, commonsense knowledge is widely utilized to enrich utterance semantics and enhance conversation modeling. However, most previous knowledge infusion methods perform empirical knowledge filtering and design highly customized architectures for knowledge interaction with the utterances, which can discard useful knowledge aspects and limit their generalizability to different knowledge sources. Based on these observations, we propose a Bipartite Heterogeneous Graph (BHG) method for enhancing emotional reasoning with commonsense knowledge. In BHG, the extracted context-aware utterance representations and knowledge representations are modeled as heterogeneous nodes. Two more knowledge aggregation node types are proposed ",

    "translated_abstract": "AI系统在情感推理方面的上下文感知能力，特别是在对话中，对于诸如从社交媒体中进行在线意见挖掘和共情对话系统等应用非常重要。由于许多情境中情感的传递具有隐含性质，常识知识被广泛应用于丰富话语语义和增强对话建模。然而，大多数先前的知识注入方法执行经验性的知识过滤，并设计高度定制的架构以与话语进行知识交互，这可能丢弃有用的知识方面并限制其对不同知识来源的泛化能力。基于这些观察结果，我们提出了一种用于增强具有常识知识的情感推理的二分异构图(BHG)方法。在BHG中，提取的上下文感知话语表示和知识表示被建模为异构节点。还提出了两种更多的知识聚合节点类型。",
