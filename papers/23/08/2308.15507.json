    "abstract": "We introduce unORANIC, an unsupervised approach that uses an adapted loss function to drive the orthogonalization of anatomy and image-characteristic features. The method is versatile for diverse modalities and tasks, as it does not require domain knowledge, paired data samples, or labels. During test time unORANIC is applied to potentially corrupted images, orthogonalizing their anatomy and characteristic components, to subsequently reconstruct corruption-free images, showing their domain-invariant anatomy only. This feature orthogonalization further improves generalization and robustness against corruptions. We confirm this qualitatively and quantitatively on 5 distinct datasets by assessing unORANIC's classification accuracy, corruption detection and revision capabilities. Our approach shows promise for enhancing the generalizability and robustness of practical applications in medical image analysis.

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了unORANIC，一种使用调整后的损失函数驱动解剖和图像特征的正交化的无监督方法。该方法适用于不同的模态和任务，不需要领域知识、配对数据样本或标签。在测试时，unORANIC被应用于可能有损坏的图像，将其解剖学和特征分量正交化，然后重建无损坏的图像，仅显示其领域不变的解剖学特征。这种特征的正交化进一步提高了泛化能力和抗损坏能力。我们通过评估unORANIC的分类准确性、损坏检测和修订能力，在5个不同的数据集上 qualitatively 和 quantitatively 确认了这一点。我们的方法显示了在医学图像分析的实际应用中提高泛化能力和鲁棒性的潜力。源代码可在 https://github.com/sdoerrich97/unORANIC 获取。",
