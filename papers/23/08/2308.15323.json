    "translated_abstract": "面部解析是为每个语义面部组件推断像素级标签图的过程。以前的方法通常对无遮挡的面部效果良好，但在面部遮挡下忽略了遮挡和忽视了单个面部外一些上下文区域，尤其是在COVID-19流行期间，面部遮挡已经成为一种常见情况。受图像照明理论的启发，我们提出了一种新颖的图像预处理方法，即由四个Tanh变换组成的均匀Tanh变换，将中央视觉和周边视觉融合在一起。我们的方法解决了遮挡下面部解析的困境，并压缩了更多的周围上下文信息。基于均匀的Tanh变换，我们提出了一种适用于遮挡面部解析的遮挡感知卷积神经网络。它结合了Tanh极坐标空间和Tanh笛卡尔空间中的信息，能够增强感受野。此外，我们引入了一种遮挡感知损失，专注于遮挡边界。",
