    "translated_abstract": "本文讨论非平稳多臂赌博方法的系统架构设计和部署，以根据最近的交易历史确定接近最优的支付路由策略。我们提出了一种基于射线的新型路由服务架构，通过最优的扩展赌博式支付路由来处理每秒超过10000次的交易量，并符合Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) 的系统设计要求和生态约束。我们首先在自定义模拟器上评估了多个基于赌博算法的支付路由算法的有效性，以对比多个非平稳赌博方法并确定最佳超参数。然后我们在虚拟体育平台Dream11的支付交易系统上进行了实时实验。在实时实验中，我们证明了我们的非平稳赌博算法相比传统方法可以始终提高0.92\\%的交易成功率。",
