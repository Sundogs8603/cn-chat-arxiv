    "translated_abstract": "公共交通路线规划在交通网络设计中起着至关重要的作用，确保乘客获得满意的服务水平。然而，当前的路线规划解决方案依赖于传统的运营研究启发式算法，实施起来耗时，并且缺乏提供快速解决方案的能力。在这里，我们提出了一种新颖的基于深度学习的方法，用于决策支持系统，使公共交通规划者能够快速确定短期路线改进。通过在特定时间段内无缝调整两个站点之间特定路段的路线，我们的方法有效地减少时间并提升公共交通服务。利用GTFS和智能卡数据等多样化的数据源，我们提取特征并将交通网络建模为有向图。通过自监督学习，我们训练了一个深度学习模型，用于预测道路段的延迟值。然后，这些延迟值被用作交通图中的边权重，实现了快速路径规划决策。",
