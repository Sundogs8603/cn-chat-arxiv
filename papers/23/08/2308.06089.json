    "abstract": "Machine Learning models are capable of generating complex music across a range of genres from folk to classical music.

Whilst research has started to explore how explainable AI (XAI) generative models might be created for music, no generative XAI models have been studied in music making practice. This paper introduces an autoethnographic study of the use of the MeasureVAE generative music XAI model with interpretable latent dimensions trained on Irish folk music. Findings suggest that the exploratory nature of the music-making workflow foregrounds musical features of the training dataset rather than features of the generative model itself.

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型能够生成各种风格的复杂音乐，从民间音乐到古典音乐。然而，当前的生成音乐人工智能模型通常在意义上难以理解和控制。虽然研究已开始探索如何为音乐创建可解释的生成式人工智能（XAI）模型，但尚未研究过在音乐创作实践中的生成XAI模型。本文介绍了一项关于使用在爱尔兰民间音乐上训练的可解释潜在维度测量变分自编码器（MeasureVAE）生成音乐XAI模型的自传式研究。研究结果表明，音乐创作工作流程的探索性质突显了训练数据集的音乐特征，而非生成模型本身的特征。将XAI模型纳入迭代式工作流程中突显了XAI模型在更丰富、更复杂的工作流程中的潜力，而这些模型最初并不是为此设计的。",
