    "translated_abstract": "最近，各种神经辐射场方法在高渲染速度方面取得了显著成功。然而，当前的加速方法专门化并且不适用于各种隐式方法，这阻碍了对不同类型的NeRF作品进行实时合成。由于NeRF依赖于沿光线采样，因此可以提供一般性的指导。我们提出了一个通用的隐式流水线来快速合成NeRF对象。这种新方法使得动态阴影可以使用解析光源在对象内部或对象之间进行投射，同时允许多个NeRF对象以任意刚体变换无缝地放置和渲染在一起。主要地，我们的工作引入了一种称为神经深度场（NeDF）的新的表面表示方法，它通过允许光线和隐式表面之间的直接相交计算来快速确定对象之间的空间关系。它利用一个交点神经网络来加速查询NeRF。",
