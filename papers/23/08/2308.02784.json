    "translated_abstract": "随着智能系统对人机界面的需求不断增长，开发眼球控制系统已成为必要。眼球注视作为一种非侵入性的人机交互方式，是最适合的方法之一。基于外观的深度学习模型是眼球注视估计中最常用的方法。但是，这些模型的性能完全受到标记的眼球注视数据集的大小的影响，并且这种影响会影响性能的泛化能力。本文旨在开发一种用于眼球注视方向估计的半监督对比学习框架。在标记的眼球注视数据集较小的情况下，该框架能够找到一个泛化的解决方案，即使是看不见的人脸图像也能进行估计。我们提出了一种新的对比损失范式，既最大化了相似图片之间的相似性，同时减少了嵌入表示中的冗余。我们的对比回归框架在性能上表现良好，优于其他一些最先进的方法。",
