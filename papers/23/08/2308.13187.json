    "translated_abstract": "随着在线广告和推荐系统中点击率（CTR）预测任务的复杂性和规模增加，准确估计特征的重要性成为开发有效模型的关键。本文提出了一种基于注意力的方法，利用最大值和平均值池化操作以及逐位注意力机制，在CTR预测中增强特征重要性估计。传统上，最大值和平均值池化等池化操作被广泛用于从特征中提取相关信息。然而，这些操作可能导致信息丢失，并妨碍准确确定特征的重要性。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的注意力架构，利用逐位注意力结构强调特征中所有位之间的关系，同时进行最大池化和平均池化。通过考虑位级的细粒度交互，我们的方法旨在提高CTR预测的精确性。",
