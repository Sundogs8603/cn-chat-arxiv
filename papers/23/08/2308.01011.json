    "translated_abstract": "时间序列分析是各个应用领域的基础任务，深度学习方法在这个领域表现出了非凡的性能。然而，许多现实世界的时间序列数据展现出重要的周期性或准周期性动态，这些动态往往不能被现有的基于深度学习的解决方案充分捕捉到。这导致对感兴趣的基础动态行为的表示不完整。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种无监督的方法叫做Floss，它通过自动化地在频域上调整学到的表示来进行正则化。Floss方法首先自动检测时间序列中的主要周期性。然后，它利用周期移位和谱密度相似度度量来学习具有周期一致性的有意义的表示。此外，Floss可以轻松地整合到有监督、半监督和无监督的学习框架中。",
