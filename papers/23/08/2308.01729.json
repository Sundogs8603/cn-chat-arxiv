The CANN approach combines a classical actuarial model, such as a generalized linear model, with a neural network. This blending of models results in a two-component model comprising a classical regression model and a neural network part. The CANN model leverages the strengths of both components, providing a solid foundation and interpretability from the classical model while harnessing the flexibility and capacity to capture intricate relationships and interactions offered by the neural network. In our proposed models, we use well-known log-linear claim count regression models for the classical regression part and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) for the neural network part. The MLP part is used to process telematics car driving data given as a vector characterizing the driving behavior ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于Mario W\\\"uthrich和Michael Merz提出的联合精算神经网络（CANN）框架的横断面和纵向索赔计数模型。CANN方法将传统的精算模型（如广义线性模型）与神经网络相结合，形成了一个包含经典回归模型和神经网络部分的双组件模型。CANN模型充分利用了两个模型的优势，既可以提供经典模型的可靠性和可解释性，又可以利用神经网络的灵活性和对复杂关系和交互作用的捕捉能力。在我们提出的模型中，我们使用了广为人知的对数线性索赔计数回归模型作为经典回归部分，使用了多层感知器（MLP）作为神经网络部分。MLP部分用于处理以向量形式表示的车辆驾驶行为的车载通信数据。",
