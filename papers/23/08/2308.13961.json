    "translated_abstract": "为了进行良好的翻译，机器翻译系统和通用语言模型需要对源语言和目标语言以及文化有深入的理解。因此，由于其非组合性的特性，习语对基于Transformer的系统提出了特殊的挑战，因为直译往往会忽略意图。传统方法使用现有的知识库（KB）替换习语，往往缺乏规模和上下文意识。针对这些挑战，我们的方法优先考虑上下文意识和可扩展性，允许在可管理的KB大小的离线存储中存储习语。这确保了更高效的小型模型服务，并提供了对习语表达的更全面的理解。我们介绍了一个使用大型语言模型开发的多语言习语KB（IdiomKB）来解决这个问题。通过检索习语的比喻意义，该KB可以帮助小型模型（如BLOOMZ（7.1B），Alpaca（7B）和InstructGPT（6.7B））实现更好的翻译。",
