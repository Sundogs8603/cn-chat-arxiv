    "abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) systems have seen rapid progress in recent years due to the development of deep neural networks. These systems are widely used in various natural language processing applications, such as information extraction, question answering, and sentiment analysis. However, the complexity and intractability of deep neural networks can make NER systems unreliable in certain circumstances, resulting in incorrect predictions. For example, NER systems may misidentify female names as chemicals or fail to recognize the names of minority groups, leading to user dissatisfaction. To tackle this problem, we introduce TIN, a novel, widely applicable approach for automatically testing and repairing various NER systems. The key idea for automated testing is that the NER predictions of the same named entities under similar contexts should be identical. The core idea for automated repairing is that similar named entities should have the same NER prediction under the same context.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，由于深度神经网络的发展，命名实体识别（NER）系统取得了快速进展。这些系统广泛应用于各种自然语言处理应用中，如信息提取、问答和情感分析。然而，深度神经网络的复杂性和难以处理性可能使NER系统在某些情况下变得不可靠，导致错误的预测。例如，NER系统可能错误地将女性名字识别为化学物质，或者无法识别出少数群体的名字，从而导致用户不满。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一个新颖的、广泛适用的方法——TIN，用于自动测试和修复各种NER系统。自动测试的关键思想是相似语境下相同命名实体的NER预测应该相同。自动修复的核心思想是相似的命名实体在相同语境下应该具有相同的NER预测。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种自动测试和修复命名实体识别系统的新方法TIN，该方法能够解决深度神经网络在特定情况下不可靠的问题，确保相似语境下相同命名实体的NER预测相同，从而提高系统的可靠性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel approach, TIN, for automated testing and repairing of named entity recognition (NER) systems. It addresses the issue of unreliability in NER systems caused by the complexity of deep neural networks, ensuring that NER predictions for similar named entities under similar contexts are consistent, thus improving system reliability."
