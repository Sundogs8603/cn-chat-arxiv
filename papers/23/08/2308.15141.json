    "translated_abstract": "量化预测不确定性被认为是开发更可靠的人工智能模型的一种方式，超越传统性能指标报告。在考虑其在临床决策支持环境中的作用时，人工智能分类模型理想情况下应避免自信的错误预测并最大限度地提高正确预测的置信度。这样做的模型被认为在置信度方面具有良好的校准性。然而，在训练这些模型时，如何改善校准性，即使训练策略不确定性感知，却相对少受到关注。在这项工作中，我们评估了三种新颖的不确定性感知训练策略，并与两种最先进的方法进行比较。我们分析了两种不同的临床应用的性能：心脏复同步疗法（CRT）反应预测和冠状动脉疾病（CAD）的心脏磁共振（CMR）图像诊断。在性能方面表现最佳的模型是",
