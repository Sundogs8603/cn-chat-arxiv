    "translated_abstract": "在许多仓储和物流应用中，密集堆放是一个重要的特性。这个领域的早期研究主要集中在仿真中的规划算法上，但现实世界中的堆放性能往往受到高度遮挡、部分观察场景中三维物体几何形状感知的困难的限制。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个完全卷积的形状补全模型F-CON，它可以轻松地与现成的规划方法结合，在现实世界中实现密集堆放。我们还发布了一个模拟数据集COB-3D-v2，可以用于训练真实世界机器人应用的形状补全模型，并使用该数据集证明F-CON优于其他最先进的形状补全方法。最后，我们将F-CON应用于真实世界的捡放系统中，并演示了在杂乱的场景中对复杂、未见过的物体进行密集堆放。在多种规划方法下，F-CON实现了比其他方法更好的密集堆放效果。",
