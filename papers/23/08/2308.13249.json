    "translated_abstract": "短视频推荐是当今工业信息系统中最重要的推荐应用之一。与其他推荐任务相比，海量的反馈是最典型的特点。具体来说，在短视频推荐中，最容易收集到的用户反馈是跳过行为，这对推荐模型提出了两个重要的挑战。首先，跳过行为反映了隐式的用户偏好，因此对于兴趣提取是具有挑战性的。其次，这种特殊的反馈涉及到多个目标，如总观看时间，这也是非常具有挑战性的。在本文中，我们介绍了我们在快手中的工业解决方案，每天为十亿级用户提供服务。具体来说，我们部署了一个关注反馈的编码模块，很好地提取用户偏好并考虑了上下文的影响。我们进一步设计了一个多目标预测模块，能够很好地区分相关和不相关的视频。",
