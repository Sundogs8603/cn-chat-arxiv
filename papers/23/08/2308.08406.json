This paper proposed a content-based recommendation engine for providing video suggestion to the user based on their previous interests and choices. We will use TF-IDF text vectorization method to determine the relevance of words in a document. Then we will find out the similarity between each content by calculating cosine similarity between them. Finally, engine will recommend videos to the users based on the obtained similarity score value. In addition, we will measure the engine's performance by computing precision, recall, and F1 core of the proposed system.",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐引擎使用机器学习算法向用户建议内容、产品或服务。本文提出了一种基于内容的推荐引擎，根据用户之前的兴趣和选择，向用户提供视频推荐。我们将使用TF-IDF文本向量化方法来确定文档中单词的相关性。然后通过计算它们之间的余弦相似度，找出每个内容之间的相似性。最后，根据得到的相似度分数值，引擎将向用户推荐视频。另外，我们将通过计算精确率、召回率和F1得分来衡量引擎的性能。",
