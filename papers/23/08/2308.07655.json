    "abstract": "Commit messages are crucial to software development, allowing developers to track changes and collaborate effectively. Despite their utility, most commit messages lack important information since writing high-quality commit messages is tedious and time-consuming. The active research on commit message generation (CMG) has not yet led to wide adoption in practice. We argue that if we could shift the focus from commit message generation to commit message completion and use previous commit history as additional context, we could significantly improve the quality and the personal nature of the resulting commit messages.  In this paper, we propose and evaluate both of these novel ideas. Since the existing datasets lack historical data, we collect and share a novel dataset called CommitChronicle, containing 10.7M commits across 20 programming languages. We use this dataset to evaluate the completion setting and the usefulness of the historical context for state-of-the-art CMG models and GPT-3",

    "translated_abstract": "提交信息对软件开发至关重要，可以帮助开发人员跟踪改动并有效地协作。尽管有用，但大多数提交信息缺乏重要信息，因为编写高质量的提交信息是繁琐且耗时的。目前关于提交信息生成的研究尚未在实践中得到广泛应用。本文提出并评估了从提交信息生成转向提交信息补全，并使用先前的提交历史作为额外上下文的新思路，可以显著提高生成的提交信息的质量和个性化程度。我们收集并共享了一个名为CommitChronicle的新数据集，其中包含20种编程语言的1070万个提交。我们使用这个数据集来评估补全设置和历史上下文对于最先进的提交信息生成模型和GPT-3的实用性。",
