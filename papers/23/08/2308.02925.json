    "translated_abstract": "顺序用户建模是个性化推荐系统中的关键任务，其着重于预测用户最喜欢的下一个项目，需要深入理解用户的行为序列。尽管Transformer模型在各个领域取得了显着成功，但在理解用户行为方面尚未充分发挥其潜力。本文重新审视了Transformer类似的架构，旨在推进最先进的性能。我们首先重新审视Transformer方法的核心构建模块，在顺序用户建模的背景下分析项目对项目机制的有效性。在进行彻底的实验分析后，我们确定了三个设计高效顺序用户模型的基本标准，希望这些标准能作为实用指南，激发和塑造未来的设计。在此基础上，我们介绍了ConvFormer，一种对Transformer架构进行简单但强大修改的方法，满足了这些标准，从而提高了模型的性能。",
