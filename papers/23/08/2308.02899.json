    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了在错开治疗采用设置中识别和估计因果效应参数的问题，也就是说，研究人员可以访问面板数据，并且治疗时机在单位之间变化。我们考虑了未经处理的潜在结果可能在时间上跟随不平行趋势的情况。这意味着像区别于差异这样的主流方法的识别假设并不成立。主要关注未经处理的潜在结果由交互固定效应模型生成的情况，并展示了治疗时机的变动提供了额外的矩条件，可以用来恢复一类大型目标因果效应参数。我们的方法利用了治疗时机的变动，而不需要（i）大量的时间段或（ii）任何额外的排除限制条件。这与几乎所有有关交互固定效应模型的文献形成了鲜明对比，后者至少需要...

    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores how to identify and estimate causal effect parameters in a staggered treatment adoption design. The study finds that traditional methods fail to meet the identifying assumptions when untreated potential outcomes follow non-parallel trends. They propose an approach that leverages the variation in treatment timing to recover causal effect parameters without the need for a large number of time periods or additional exclusion restrictions."
