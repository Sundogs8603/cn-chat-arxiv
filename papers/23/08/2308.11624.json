    "abstract": "An innovative methodology that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and graph representation for semiconductor device encoding in TCAD device simulation is proposed. A graph-based universal encoding scheme is presented that not only considers material-level and device-level embeddings, but also introduces a novel spatial relationship embedding inspired by interpolation operations typically used in finite element meshing. Universal physical laws from device simulations are leveraged for comprehensive data-driven modeling, which encompasses surrogate Poisson emulation and current-voltage (IV) prediction based on drift-diffusion model. Both are achieved using a novel graph attention network, referred to as RelGAT. Comprehensive technical details based on the device simulator Sentaurus TCAD are presented, empowering researchers to adopt the proposed AI-driven Electronic Design Automation (EDA) solution at the device level.",
