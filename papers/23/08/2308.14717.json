    "abstract": "A group of agents each exert effort to produce a joint output, with the complementarities between their efforts represented by a (weighted) network. Under equity compensation, a principal motivates the agents to work by giving them shares of the output. We describe the optimal equity allocation. It is characterized by a neighborhood balance condition: any two agents receiving equity have the same (weighted) total equity assigned to their neighbors. We also study the problem of selecting the team of agents who receive positive equity, and show this team must form a tight-knit subset of the complementarity network, with any pair being complementary to one another or jointly to another team member. Finally, we give conditions under which the amount of equity used for compensation is increasing in the strength of a team's complementarities and discuss several other applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "一组代理人通过合作产生一个共同的产出，他们的努力之间的互补性由一个（加权）网络表示。在公平报酬下，委托人通过给予代理人产出的份额来激励他们工作。我们描述了最佳的股权分配。它的特点是邻居平衡条件：任何两个接收股权的代理人在其邻居中分配的（加权）总股权相同。我们还研究了选择接收正向股权的代理人团队的问题，并表明该团队必须是互补网络的一个紧密子集，任何一对成员之间或与另一个团队成员一起发挥互补作用。最后，我们给出了以团队互补性的强度增加为补偿使用的股权数量的条件，并讨论了其他几个应用。",

We also examine the problem of selecting team members who receive positive equity and provide conditions for complementarity among team members. Additionally, we discuss the relationship between the amount of equity and the strength of team complementarities, as well as explore other applications."
