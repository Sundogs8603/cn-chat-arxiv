    "translated_abstract": "目前，在实时领域中采用有向无环图(DAG)任务来模拟汽车、航空航天和工业领域中通过链式互通任务实现功能的复杂应用。本文通过提出一种基于微不足道调度概念的新型可调度性测试，研究了实时DAG任务调度问题。利用这个可调度性测试，我们提出了一个新的DAG调度框架(边缘生成调度--EGS)，它试图通过迭代生成边缘来最小化DAG宽度，并同时保证截止时间约束。我们研究了如何通过开发一个深度强化学习算法和图表示神经网络来高效解决生成边缘的问题，以学习EGS的高效边缘生成策略。通过将其与最先进的DAG调度启发式算法和最佳混合整数进行比较，我们评估了所提算法的有效性。",
