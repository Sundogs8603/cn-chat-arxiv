    "translated_abstract": "临床医生花费大量时间筛选病人笔记并在电子健康记录（EHR）中记录是临床医生倦怠的主要原因。通过在记录过程中主动和动态地检索相关笔记，我们可以减少查找相关病例历史所需的工作量。在这项工作中，我们概念化了使用EHR审计日志作为机器学习的来源，以监督特定临床背景下、特定时间点的笔记相关性。我们的评估重点放在紧急科室的动态检索上，这是一个具有独特信息检索和笔记编写模式的高重症设置。我们显示我们的方法在预测哪些笔记会在个别笔记撰写会话中被阅读方面可以实现0.963的AUC。此外，我们对多名临床医生进行了用户研究，发现我们的框架可以帮助临床医生更高效地检索相关信息。通过展示我们的框架和...",
