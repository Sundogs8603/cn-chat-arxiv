    "translated_abstract": "通过建立匹配的必要和充分条件，并给出相应的样本复杂性上界，我们对量子测量类的可学习性进行了刻画，其中学习器仅能接触到已准备好的量子态。我们首先探究了先前作品中关于该设置的结果。我们发现，在一些可学习类别中，先前作品中定义的经验风险与经典理论中的定义相一致，但未能满足统一收敛性质。此外，我们发现，先前作品中对VC维度广义上界的推广常常是无穷的，即使对于有限维的POVM类别也是如此。为了克服标准ERM未能满足统一收敛性的问题，我们提出了一种新的学习规则——去噪ERM。我们证明了对于POVM和概率观测的概念类别，这是一种通用的学习规则，并给出了它满足统一收敛性的条件。",

We propose a new learning rule called denoised ERM to overcome the failure of the standard ERM in satisfying uniform convergence. This rule is universal for POVM and probabilistically observed concept classes."
