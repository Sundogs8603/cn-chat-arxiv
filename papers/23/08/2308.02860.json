    "translated_abstract": "学习排序是top-N推荐任务中的核心技术，理想的排名器应该是一个从项目集合到排列（即排列）的映射。现有的大多数解决方案属于概率排序原则（PRP）范式，即首先对候选集中的每个项目进行评分，然后执行排序操作以生成排名列表。然而，这些方法忽视了个体评分过程中候选项目之间的上下文依赖性，并且排序操作是不可微分的。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了一种名为STARank的集合到排列排序框架，它直接生成候选项目的排列，而不需要进行个别评分和排序操作，并且是端到端可微分的。因此，STARank可以在只有真实排列可访问但没有项目的真实相关度分数的情况下运行。为此，STARank首先阅读候选项目...",
