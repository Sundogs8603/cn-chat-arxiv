Fraudulent schemes and traps are growing rapidly in the investment world. Due to this, countries and individuals face huge financial risks. We present an awareness system with the use of machine learning and gamification techniques to educate the people about investment scams and traps. Our system applies machine learning techniques to provide a personalized learning experience to the user. The system chooses distinct game-design elements and scams from the knowledge pool crafted by domain experts for each individual.

    "translated_abstract": "在现今社交平台的兴起下，任何人都能轻易传播虚假信息并诱使人们落入陷阱。投资领域中的欺诈行为与陷阱正在迅速增长，给国家和个人带来巨大的财务风险。我们提出了一个运用机器学习和游戏化技术的系统，用于教育人们认识投资诈骗和陷阱。我们的系统应用机器学习技术，为用户提供个性化的学习体验。系统从领域专家提供的知识库中选择不同的游戏设计元素和欺诈行为，针对每个用户进行教育。研究项目的目标是通过主动学习来减少各国间的不平等，帮助监管机构确保一个公正、高效和包容的资本市场环境。在论文中，我们讨论了该问题的影响，并提供了实现方案。",
