    "translated_abstract": "针对细粒度图像分类任务的模型，由于类别之间的差异极为微妙且每类样本数量较少，很容易受到背景相关偏差的影响，需要使用稳健的方法来处理具有非分布背景的潜在样本。为了更深入地了解这个关键问题，我们的研究调查了背景引起的偏差对细粒度图像分类的影响，评估了诸如卷积神经网络（CNN）和视觉转换器（ViT）等标准骨干模型。我们探索了两种掩蔽策略来减轻背景引起的偏差：早期掩蔽，即在（输入）图像级别上去除背景信息，以及晚期掩蔽，即选择性地掩蔽与背景相对应的高层空间特征。通过大量实验评估了CNN和ViT模型在不同掩蔽策略下的行为，重点关注它们对非分布背景的泛化能力。",
