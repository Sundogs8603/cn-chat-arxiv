    "abstract": "Diagnostic codes for Barrett's esophagus (BE), a precursor to esophageal cancer, lack granularity and precision for many research or clinical use cases. Laborious manual chart review is required to extract key diagnostic phenotypes from BE pathology reports. We developed a generalizable transformer-based method to automate data extraction. Using pathology reports from Columbia University Irving Medical Center with gastroenterologist-annotated targets, we performed binary dysplasia classification as well as granularized multi-class BE-related diagnosis classification. We utilized two clinically pre-trained large language models, with best model performance comparable to a highly tailored rule-based system developed using the same data. Binary dysplasia extraction achieves 0.964 F1-score, while the multi-class model achieves 0.911 F1-score. Our method is generalizable and faster to implement as compared to a tailored rule-based approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "Barrett食管炎（BE）的诊断代码在许多研究或临床使用情况下缺乏细化和精确性。需要费力的手动查阅病历以从BE病理报告中提取关键诊断表型。我们开发了一种通用的基于transformer的方法来自动化数据提取。使用哥伦比亚大学欧文医学中心的病理报告和胃肠病学家注释的目标，我们进行了二元异型分级以及细分的多类BE相关诊断分类。我们利用了两个临床预训练的大型语言模型，最佳模型性能与使用相同数据开发的高度定制的基于规则的系统相当。二元异型提取实现了0.964的F1分数，而多类模型实现了0.911的F1分数。我们的方法具有通用性，并且比定制的基于规则的方法更快实施。",
