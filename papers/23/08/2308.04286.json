    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems typically use handcrafted feature extraction pipelines. To avoid their inherent information loss and to achieve more consistent modeling from speech to transcribed text, neural raw waveform feature extractors (FEs) are an appealing approach. Also the wav2vec 2.0 model, which has recently gained large popularity, uses a convolutional FE which operates directly on the speech waveform. However, it is not yet studied extensively in the literature. In this work, we study its capability to replace the standard feature extraction methods in a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) ASR model and compare it to an alternative neural FE. We show that both are competitive with traditional FEs on the LibriSpeech benchmark and analyze the effect of the individual components. Furthermore, we analyze the learned filters and show that the most important information for the ASR system is obtained by a set of bandpass filters.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动语音识别（ASR）系统通常使用手工设计的特征提取流程。为了避免它们固有的信息损失，并实现从语音到转录文本的更一致的建模，神经原始波形特征提取器（FEs）是一种有吸引力的方法。最近广受欢迎的wav2vec 2.0模型也使用了卷积FE，直接对语音波形进行操作。然而，它在文献中研究得还不够充分。本研究中，我们研究了它在连接主义时间分类（CTC）ASR模型中替代标准特征提取方法的能力，并将其与另一种替代性神经FE进行了比较。我们表明，在LibriSpeech基准测试中，两者都与传统的FEs竞争力不相上下，并分析了各个组件的影响。此外，我们还分析了学习到的滤波器，并显示ASR系统的最重要信息是通过一组带通滤波器获得的。",
