    "abstract": "A trite yet fundamental question in economics is: What causes large asset price fluctuations? A tenfold rise in the price of GameStop equity, between the 22nd and 28th of January 2021, demonstrated that herding behaviour among retail investors is an important contributing factor. This paper presents a data-driven guide to the forum that started the hype -- WallStreetBets (WSB). Our initial experiments decompose the forum using a large language topic model and network tools. The topic model describes the evolution of the forum over time and shows the persistence of certain topics (such as the market / S\\&P500 discussion), and the sporadic interest in others, such as COVID or crude oil. Network analysis allows us to decompose the landscape of retail investors into clusters based on their posting and discussion habits; several large, correlated asset discussion clusters emerge, surrounded by smaller, niche ones. A second set of experiments assesses the impact that WSB discussions have had",

    "translated_abstract": "经济学中一个平凡但基本的问题是：是什么导致了资产价格的大幅波动？2021年1月22日至28日期间，GameStop股票价格翻了十倍，这表明散户投资者的群集行为是一个重要的促成因素。本文提供了对引起热潮的论坛WallStreetBets（WSB）的数据驱动指南。我们的初始实验使用大规模的语言主题模型和网络工具对论坛进行了分解。主题模型描述了论坛随时间的演变，并展示了某些主题（如市场/S\\&P500讨论）的持久性，以及对其他主题（如COVID或原油）的零散兴趣。网络分析使我们能够基于用户的发帖和讨论习惯将零售投资者的景观进行分解；出现了几个大的、相关的资产讨论群集，周围是较小的、小众的群集。第二组实验评估了WSB讨论对市场的影响。",
