    "abstract": "The Red Palm Weevil (RPW), also known as the palm weevil, is considered among the world's most damaging insect pests of palms. Current detection techniques include the detection of symptoms of RPW using visual or sound inspection and chemical detection of volatile signatures generated by infested palm trees. However, efficient detection of RPW diseases at an early stage is considered one of the most challenging issues for cultivating date palms. In this paper, an efficient approach to the early detection of RPW is proposed. The proposed approach is based on RPW sound activities being recorded and analyzed. The first step involves the conversion of sound data into images based on a selected set of features. The second step involves the combination of images from the same sound file but computed by different features into a single image. The third step involves the application of different Deep Learning (DL) techniques to classify resulting images into two classes: infested and not infes",

    "translated_abstract": "红棕象被认为是全球最具破坏性的棕榈树害虫之一。目前的检测技术包括使用视觉或声音检查以及化学检测受侵染棕榈树生成的挥发性特征的病症检测。然而，对于栽培枣椰树来说，及早检测红棕象病害被认为是最具挑战性的问题之一。本文提出了一种有效的红棕象早期检测方法。该方法基于记录和分析红棕象声音活动。第一步是根据选择的一组特征将声音数据转换成图像。第二步是将来自同一声音文件但由不同特征计算得出的图像组合成单个图像。第三步是应用不同的深度学习技术将结果图像分类为两类：受侵染和未受侵染。",
