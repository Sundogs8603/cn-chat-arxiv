    "abstract": "Privacy preservation has long been a concern in smart acoustic monitoring systems, where speech can be passively recorded along with a target signal in the system's operating environment. In this study, we propose the integration of two commonly used approaches in privacy preservation: source separation and adversarial representation learning. The proposed system learns the latent representation of audio recordings such that it prevents differentiating between speech and non-speech recordings. Initially, the source separation network filters out some of the privacy-sensitive data, and during the adversarial learning process, the system will learn privacy-preserving representation on the filtered signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by comparing our method against systems without source separation, without adversarial learning, and without both. Overall, our results suggest that the proposed system can significantly improve speech privacy preservation compared",

    "translated_abstract": "长期以来，隐私保护一直是智能声学监测系统中的一个关注点，其中语音可以被被动地记录下来，同时也记录下了系统操作环境中的目标信号。在本研究中，我们提出了在隐私保护中常用的两种方法的整合：源分离和对抗性表征学习。所提出的系统学习音频记录的潜在表征，以防止区分语音和非语音记录。最初，源分离网络过滤掉了一些隐私敏感数据，而在对抗学习过程中，系统会在过滤后的信号上学习隐私保护表征。我们通过将我们的方法与没有源分离、没有对抗学习以及两者都没有的系统进行比较，证明了我们提出方法的有效性。总体而言，我们的结果表明，与其他系统相比，所提出的系统可以显著提高语音隐私保护。",
