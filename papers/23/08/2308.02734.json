    "translated_abstract": "大规模无线网络的出现，带来了对设计最佳控制策略的新挑战，因为这些网络具有部分可观察和时变动态。本文研究了在具有广义干扰约束的无线网络中的有效调度算法，其中平均到达率和平均服务率是未知和非稳态的。该模型展示了现代网络中无线通信的边缘设备的实际特征。我们提出了一种新颖的算法，称为MW-UCB，用于广义无线网络调度，它基于最大权重策略，并利用滑动窗口上界置信度来学习非稳态下的信道统计量。在对平均服务率的变异性提出温和假设的前提下，我们证明了MW-UCB在吞吐量方面是最优的。具体来说，只要在任何时间段内平均服务率的总变化以次线性增长，我们就可以证明MW-UCB可以实现任意的稳定区域。",
