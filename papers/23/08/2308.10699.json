    "title": "Cost-Efficient Online Decision Making: A Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit Approach",
    "abstract": "Online decision making plays a crucial role in numerous real-world applications. In many scenarios, the decision is made based on performing a sequence of tests on the incoming data points. However, performing all tests can be expensive and is not always possible. In this paper, we provide a novel formulation of the online decision making problem based on combinatorial multi-armed bandits and take the (possibly stochastic) cost of performing tests into account. Based on this formulation, we provide a new framework for cost-efficient online decision making which can utilize posterior sampling or BayesUCB for exploration. We provide a theoretical analysis of Thompson Sampling for cost-efficient online decision making, and present various experimental results that demonstrate the applicability of our framework to real-world problems.",

    "translated_abstract": "在线决策在许多实际应用中起关键作用。在许多情况下，决策是基于对传入数据点进行一系列测试来进行的。然而，执行所有测试可能是昂贵的，并且并非总是可行的。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于组合多臂赌博机的在线决策问题的新形式，并考虑了执行测试的（可能是随机的）成本。基于这种形式化，我们提供了一种新的成本有效的在线决策框架，可以利用后验抽样或BayesUCB进行探索。我们对用于成本有效在线决策的Thompson抽样进行了理论分析，并提供了各种实验结果，证明我们的框架适用于实际问题。",
