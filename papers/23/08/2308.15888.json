    "translated_abstract": "在答案集规划中，答案集捕捉到了对搜索问题的解决方案，因此高效计算答案集是非常重要的。一种可行的实现策略是基于转换的ASP，其中逻辑程序被转换为其他知识表示形式，如布尔可满足性（SAT），SAT模理论（SMT）和混合整数规划（MIP）。因此，现有的求解器可以用于计算答案集。现有的许多转换依赖于程序完成和级别排名来捕捉答案集的最小性和默认否定的正确性。在这项工作中，我们重新考虑级别排名约束，旨在对ASP的基于聚合的扩展进行更系统化的一般化。通过应用一些程序转换，可以将排名约束重写为保持单调和凸聚合结构的一般形式，从而提供了一种统一的解决方案。",
