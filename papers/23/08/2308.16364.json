    "translated_abstract": "欧盟的人工智能法案旨在规范对AI的操纵和有害使用，但缺乏对关键概念的明确定义。本文提出了技术建议，以改善该法案的概念清晰度和可执行性。我们通过审查心理模型来定义“人格特质”，主张该法案应保护完整的“心理测量资料”。我们敦促将“行为”扩展为包括“偏好”，因为偏好在因果上影响和受到行为的影响。对于“潜意识”、“操纵”和“欺骗”技术提供了清晰的定义，考虑到动机、意图和秘密性。我们区分了“利用个体”和“利用群体”，强调了不同的政策需求。一个“知情决策”由四个方面来定义：理解、准确信息、无操纵和理解AI的影响。我们对法案中的治疗用途豁免提出了警告，因为欧洲药品管理局对数字治疗尚未进行监管。",
    "tldr": "这项研究提出技术建议，以明确定义欧盟AI法案中的关键概念，并提高可执行性。它包括对人格特质、行为、潜意识和欺骗技术的定义，以及对个体和群体利用的区分。此外，它还强调了对知情决策的定义和对治疗用途豁免的警告。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study provides technical recommendations to define key concepts in the EU AI Act and enhance enforceability. It includes definitions of personality traits, behavior, subliminal and deceptive techniques, as well as the distinction between exploiting individuals and exploiting groups. Additionally, it emphasizes the definition of informed decision and warns about the exemption for therapeutic use."
