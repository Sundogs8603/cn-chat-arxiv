    "abstract": "Question answering (QA) is a critical task for speech-based retrieval from knowledge sources, by sifting only the answers without requiring to read supporting documents. Specifically, open-domain QA aims to answer user questions on unrestricted knowledge sources. Ideally, adding a source should not decrease the accuracy, but we find this property (denoted as \"monotonicity\") does not hold for current state-of-the-art methods. We identify the cause, and based on that we propose Judge-Specialist framework. Our framework consists of (1) specialist retrievers/readers to cover individual sources, and (2) judge, a dedicated language model to select the final answer. Our experiments show that our framework not only ensures monotonicity, but also outperforms state-of-the-art multi-source QA methods on Natural Questions. Additionally, we show that our models robustly preserve the monotonicity against noise from speech recognition. We publicly release our code and setting.",

    "translated_abstract": "问题回答（QA）是一项关键任务，用于从知识源中通过筛选答案而无需阅读支持文档进行基于语音的检索。特别是，开放领域的QA旨在回答关于无限制知识源的用户问题。理想情况下，添加一个来源不应降低准确性，但我们发现当前最先进的方法不满足这一特性（称为“单调性”）。我们确定了原因，并在此基础上提出了Judge-Specialist框架。我们的框架包括（1）专家主题检索器/阅读器，用于覆盖个别来源，和（2）评判者，一个专用的语言模型，用于选择最终答案。我们的实验表明，我们的框架不仅确保了单调性，而且在“自然问题”上胜过了最先进的多来源QA方法。此外，我们展示了我们的模型对于来自语音识别的噪声具有鲁棒性。我们公开发布了我们的代码和设置。",
