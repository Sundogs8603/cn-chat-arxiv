    "translated_abstract": "超关系知识图谱（HKGs）通过将属性-值修饰符与三元组相关联来扩展标准知识图谱，这有效地表示了与其关联三元组的额外细粒度信息。超关系知识图谱补全（HKGC）旨在在考虑其修饰符的情况下推断未知三元组。大多数现有的HKGC方法利用全局级图结构将超关系知识编码为图卷积消息传递过程。然而，多跳信息的添加可能会在三元组预测过程中引入噪音。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了HyperFormer，这是一个考虑局部级顺序信息的模型，它编码了三元组的实体、关系和修饰符的内容。更具体地说，HyperFormer由三个不同的模块组成：一个实体邻居聚合器模块，用于整合实体邻居的信息，以捕捉不同的视角。",
