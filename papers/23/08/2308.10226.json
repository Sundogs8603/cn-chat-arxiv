    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了迭代组合拍卖（ICA）的设计。在这个领域中的主要挑战在于束空间随着物品数量呈指数增长。为了解决这个问题，最近有几篇论文提出了基于机器学习（ML）的偏好调查算法，旨在仅从投标人那里获取最重要的信息。然而，从实际角度看，这些先前工作的主要缺点是通过价值查询（即，“对于捆绑包$\\{A,B\\}$，您的价值是多少？”）引出投标人的偏好。在大多数实际ICA领域中，价值查询被认为是不切实际的，因为它们给投标人带来了不切实际的高认知负担，这就是为什么它们在实践中不被使用的原因。在本文中，我们通过设计一个机器学习驱动的组合时钟拍卖来解决这一缺点，该拍卖只通过需求查询（即，“在价格$p$下，您对捆绑包$\\{A,B\\}$的需求有多少？”）从投标人那里引起信息。",
