    "abstract": "With the appearance of SARS-CoV-2, two epidemics have spread: one for health and one for information. The virus has generated an unprecedented infodemic, contributing to the establishment of a climate of great uncertainty. Massive and redundant information has also been an effective vector of propaganda, on a global scale, by state and non-state actors. A real hostile act in which physical violence is not foreseen, but systematic management of information through the manipulation of the cognitive sphere. For this reason, the adoption of an attitude of active critical analysis by citizens and institutions and also the implementation of common policies at an international level could undoubtedly facilitate the fight against cognitive warfare (so-called cognitive warfare) and therefore limit its disastrous effects.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着SARS-CoV-2的出现，出现了两种流行病：一种是健康流行病，另一种是信息流行病。该病毒引发了一场前所未有的信息泛滥，为建立极度不确定的氛围做出了贡献。大量冗余的信息也成为国家和非国家行为者在全球范围内传播宣传的有效途径。这是一种真正的敌对行为，其中不预见身体暴力，而是通过操纵认知领域来对信息进行系统管理。因此，公民和机构采取主动的批判性分析态度，以及在国际层面上实施共同政策，无疑可以促进对认知战争（所谓的认知战争）的斗争，并因此限制其灾难性影响。",
