    "translated_abstract": "在存在人的情况下，安全规划机器人的运动需要可靠的对未来人类运动的预测。然而，简单地预测前期交互中最可能的动作并不能保证安全。这样的预测未能模拟出可能事件的长尾部分，这些事件在有限的数据集中很少被观察到。另一方面，为最坏情况下的动作进行规划会导致过分保守的行为和\"僵化的机器人\"。相反，我们的目标是学习预测人类防范对策的预测模型。我们提出了一个创新的游戏理论框架，用于联合规划和预测，以规划器与演示者之间的绩效作为收益，并提出了实际算法，以端对端的方式训练模型。我们证明了我们提出的算法在人群导航模拟器和现实世界的行人运动数据集中产生了更安全的计划。我们将代码发布在https://github.com/portal-cornell/Game-Theoretic-Forecasting-Planning。",

By using game theory, the framework learns to predict human counterfactuals and is trained through practical algorithms in an end-to-end manner.
