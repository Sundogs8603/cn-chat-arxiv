    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一项跨语言研究，旨在利用数据驱动的计算建模来量化元音和谐。具体而言，我们基于自然语言词汇中元音的可预测性定义了一个信息论的和谐度量，我们通过音素级语言模型（PLMs）来估计。此前的定量研究在分析元音和谐时主要依赖于屈折变形的词形。相反，我们使用跨语言可比较的词根形式进行模型训练，这些形式很少或没有屈折变形，这样可以涵盖更多未被研究的语言。我们的PLMs的训练数据包括每种语言最多1000个词汇条目的词汇列表。尽管我们使用的数据比以前使用的语料库要小得多，但我们的实验表明，神经PLMs能够捕捉到一组存在这种现象的语言中的元音和谐模式。我们的工作还证明了词汇列表是一种有价值的类型学研究资源，",

    "en_tdlr": "This cross-linguistic study quantifies vowel harmony using information-theoretic measures and data-driven computational modeling. By training models on lemma forms instead of inflected word-forms, it covers a wider range of languages. The experiments show that neural PLMs can capture harmony patterns in languages exhibiting vowel harmony."
