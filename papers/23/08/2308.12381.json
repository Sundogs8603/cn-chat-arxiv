    "translated_abstract": "一个人的性别是在进行医学、社会学、政治学和经济学等各种科学学科的研究时一个至关重要的信息。然而，随着大数据的激增，性别信息的获取变得越来越困难。在这种情况下，研究人员需要从可获得的信息中，主要是从人名中推断性别。尽管通过姓名来推断性别可能引发一些伦理问题，但缺乏可行的替代方法意味着研究人员不得不使用这种方法，当目标使手段合理时-在大多数这类研究中，目标是研究性别差异的模式和决定因素。姓名到性别推断的必要性产生了一个越来越多的算法方法和软件产品的领域。这些方法已经在世界各地的学术界、工业界、政府和非政府组织中使用。",
    "tldr": "本研究评估了从姓名中推断性别的性能，该方法在没有性别信息的情况下是一种可行且广泛应用的方法。其重要性在于研究各种科学学科中对性别差异的模式和决定因素进行分析。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study evaluates the performance of inferring gender from names, which is a feasible and widely used approach when gender information is not available. The significance lies in analyzing patterns and determinants of gender disparities in various scientific disciplines."
