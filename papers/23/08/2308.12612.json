    "translated_abstract": "深度学习的快速发展激发了对增强基于日志的异常检测的兴趣。这种方法旨在从日志事件（日志消息模板）中提取意义，并开发先进的深度学习模型以进行异常检测。然而，这些深度学习方法面临着依赖训练数据、标签和计算资源的挑战，因为模型复杂性较高。相比之下，传统的机器学习和数据挖掘技术虽然不太依赖数据，更高效，但比深度学习方法效果较差。为了使基于日志的异常检测更实用，目标是增强传统技术以达到深度学习方法的效果。以前在不同领域（链接Stack Overflow上的问题）的研究表明，经过优化的传统技术可以与最先进的深度学习方法相媲美。受到这一概念的启发，我们进行了一项经验研究。我们通过整合轻量级正则化方法来优化无监督的主成分分析（PCA），一种传统技术。",
