    "translated_abstract": "尽管当前一些AI在封闭的世界，如棋盘游戏中超越了人类能力，但它们在混乱的现实世界中的表现有限。它们会犯奇怪的错误而且没有意识到。它们很难受到指导，不能运用常识，缺乏好奇心。它们不能成为良好的合作者。传统手动构建的符号AI方法构建的系统和使用生成和深度学习AI方法(包括大规模语言模型)构建的系统都无法应对这些挑战。它们不适合创建强大和可信赖的AI。尽管此方法不属于主流的AI方法，但发展脱靴法显示出希望。在发展脱靴法中，AI像人类儿童一样发展能力。它们从先天能力开始。像人类一样，它们与环境互动，并从互动中学习。它们通过自我发展的能力逐步扩展先天能力。它们互动并逐渐将所学应用于实际操作。",

However, developmental bootstrapping offers promise by imitating the developmental process of human children, providing hope for creating robust and reliable AIs."
