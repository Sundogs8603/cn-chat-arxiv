    "translated_abstract": "学习医学图像分割模型是一个本质上存在歧义的任务，因为模型训练中存在图像的不确定性（噪声）和手动标注的不确定性（人为错误和偏差）。为了建立一个可信赖的图像分割模型，不仅需要评估其性能，还需要估计模型预测的不确定性。大多数先进的图像分割网络采用层次化编码器结构，从精细到粗糙提取多个分辨率级别的图像特征。在这项工作中，我们利用这种层次化图像表示，并提出了一种简单而有效的多级不确定性估计方法。多级不确定性通过跳跃连接模块建模，然后进行采样以生成预测图像分割的不确定性地图。我们证明，当使用这种层次化不确定性估计模块实现深度学习分割网络（如U-net）时，可以实现较好的性能。",
