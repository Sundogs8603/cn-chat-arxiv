    "abstract": "Text-to-motion generation has gained increasing attention, but most existing methods are limited to generating short-term motions that correspond to a single sentence describing a single action. However, when a text stream describes a sequence of continuous motions, the generated motions corresponding to each sentence may not be coherently linked. Existing long-term motion generation methods face two main issues. Firstly, they cannot directly generate coherent motions and require additional operations such as interpolation to process the generated actions. Secondly, they generate subsequent actions in an autoregressive manner without considering the influence of future actions on previous ones. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that utilizes a past-conditioned diffusion model with two optional coherent sampling methods: Past Inpainting Sampling and Compositional Transition Sampling. Past Inpainting Sampling completes subsequent motions by treating previous motions as",

    "translated_abstract": "文本到动作的生成越来越受关注，但大多数现有方法仅限于生成与描述单个动作的单个句子相对应的短期动作。然而，当一个文本流描述一系列连续的动作时，与每个句子相对应的生成的动作可能不是连贯的。现有的长期动作生成方法面临两个主要问题。首先，它们不能直接生成连贯的动作，需要其他操作（如插值）来处理生成的动作。其次，它们以自回归方式生成后续动作，而不考虑未来动作对先前动作的影响。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的方法，利用过去条件的扩散模型和两种可选的连贯采样方法：过去修补采样和组合转换采样。",
