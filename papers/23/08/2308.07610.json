    "translated_abstract": "在现代软件密集型系统中，自动化日志分析对于确保软件维护和工程生命周期的可靠性和弹性至关重要。现有方法通过提供单个预测值而没有解释来执行诸如日志解析和日志异常检测等任务。然而，随着系统事件的增加，分析结果的有限可解释性阻碍了分析人员对其的信任度和采取适当行动的能力。此外，这些方法需要大量的领域内培训数据，并且它们的性能在涉及新域的未见过日志的在线场景中急剧下降（最多下降62.5%），这是由于软件更新的迅速而常见的情况。在本文中，我们提出了一个新颖的零样本和可解释的日志分析方法LogPrompt。LogPrompt利用大型语言模型（LLM）通过一套针对日志任务的高级提示策略执行零样本日志分析任务，从而增强LLM的性能。",
