    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一个用于量化动态环境中不确定性传播的框架。具体地，我们定义了专门针对有限时间段内的离散随机过程而设计的动态不确定性集合。这些动态不确定性集合捕捉了围绕随机过程和模型的不确定性，包括分布模糊等因素。不确定性集合的例子包括由Wasserstein距离和$f$-divergences引起的不确定性集合。我们进一步将动态稳健风险度量定义为不确定性集合内所有候选风险的上确界。我们以公理化的方式讨论了导致动态稳健风险度量的一些已知性质（如凸性和一致性）的不确定性集合的条件。此外，我们还讨论了导致稳健动态风险度量时间一致性的动态不确定性集合的必要和充分特性。我们发现，由$f$-divergences引起的不确定性集合导致较强的时间一致性。",
