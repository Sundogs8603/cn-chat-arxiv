    "abstract": "Accurate transcription of proper names and technical terms is particularly important in speech-to-text applications for business conversations. These words, which are essential to understanding the conversation, are often rare and therefore likely to be under-represented in text and audio training data, creating a significant challenge in this domain. We present a two-step keyword boosting mechanism that successfully works on normalized unigrams and n-grams rather than just single tokens, which eliminates missing hits issues with boosting raw targets. In addition, we show how adjusting the boosting weight logic avoids over-boosting multi-token keywords. This improves our keyword recognition rate by 26% relative on our proprietary in-domain dataset and 2% on LibriSpeech. This method is particularly useful on targets that involve non-alphabetic characters or have non-standard pronunciations.",

    "translated_abstract": "在商务谈话的语音到文本应用中，准确转录专有名词和技术术语尤为重要。这些词对于理解对话至关重要，但往往很少出现，因此在文本和音频训练数据中很可能缺乏，这在这个领域中造成了很大的挑战。我们提出了一个两步关键词增强机制，它成功地使用规范化的单词和n-gram而不仅仅是单个标记，从而消除了关键词目标的丢失问题。此外，我们展示了如何调整增强权重逻辑以避免过度增强多个标记的关键词。在我们的专有领域数据集上，我们的关键词识别率相对提高了26％，在LibriSpeech上提高了2％。这种方法对涉及非字母字符或具有非标准发音的目标特别有用。",
