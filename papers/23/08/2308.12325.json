    "translated_abstract": "预测给定分子的溶解度是制药行业中重要的任务，因此是一个广泛研究的课题。本研究利用现代计算资源的优势重新探讨了这个问题。我们在多个实验数据集上应用了两种机器学习模型，即线性回归模型和图卷积神经网络模型。两种方法都能做出合理的预测，而图卷积神经网络模型表现最好。然而，当前的图卷积神经网络模型是一个黑盒子，而线性回归模型的特征重要性分析提供了更多有关底层化学影响的洞察。利用线性回归模型，我们展示了每个功能团对整体溶解度的影响。最终，在设计新药时，了解化学结构如何影响化学性质是至关重要的。未来的工作应该致力于将图卷积神经网络的高性能与线性回归的可解释性相结合，释放出新的优势。",
