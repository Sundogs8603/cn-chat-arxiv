    "abstract": "Free text comments (FTC) in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) data are typically analysed using manual methods, such as content analysis, which is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Machine learning analysis methods are largely unsupervised, necessitating post-analysis interpretation. Weakly supervised text classification (WSTC) can be a valuable method of analysis to classify domain-specific text data in which there is limited labelled data. In this paper, we apply five WSTC techniques to FTC in PROMs data to identify health-related quality of life (HRQoL) themes reported by colorectal cancer patients. The WSTC methods label all the themes mentioned in the FTC. The results showed moderate performance on the PROMs data, mainly due to the precision of the models, and variation between themes. Evaluation of the classification performance illustrated the potential and limitations of keyword based WSTC to label PROMs FTC when labelled data is limited.",

    "translated_abstract": "患者报告的结果测量(PROMs)数据中的自由文本评论(FTC)通常使用手动方法进行分析，如内容分析，这种方法耗时且费力。机器学习分析方法通常是无监督的，需要进行后期解释。弱监督的文本分类(WSTC)可以是一种有价值的分析方法，用于对标记数据有限的领域特定文本数据进行分类。本文将五种WSTC技术应用于PROMs数据中的FTC，以确定结直肠癌患者报告的与健康相关的生活质量(HRQoL)主题。WSTC方法标记FTC中提到的所有主题。结果显示，PROMs数据的性能中等，主要是由于模型的精确度和主题之间的差异。对分类性能的评估揭示了基于关键字的WSTC在标记数据有限的情况下标记PROMs FTC的潜力和局限性。",
