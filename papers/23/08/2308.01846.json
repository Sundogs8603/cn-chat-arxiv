    "translated_abstract": "结构化自然语言处理（XNLP）是自然语言处理的一个重要子集，涉及理解文本的底层语义或句法结构，为许多下游应用程序提供了基本组件。尽管最近有一些努力探索特定类别的XNLP任务的通用解决方案，但统一所有XNLP任务的综合有效方法仍然不完善。与此同时，XNLP演示系统对于研究人员探索各种XNLP任务至关重要，现有平台可能受到限制，例如只支持少数XNLP任务，缺乏互动性和通用性。因此，我们提出了一个先进的XNLP演示平台，其中我们提出利用LLM实现通用XNLP，通过一个模型实现高通用性。总体而言，我们的系统在多个方面取得了进展，包括通用XNLP建模、高性能、可解释性、可扩展性和互动性。",
