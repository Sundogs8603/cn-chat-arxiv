While previous approaches have developed retrieval modules for selecting relevant passages, they face challenges in scenarios beyond two hops, owing to the limited performance of one-step methods and the failure of two-step methods when selecting irrelevant passages in earlier stages. In this work, we introduce Beam Retrieval, a general end-to-end retrieval framework for multi-hop QA. This approach maintains multiple partial hypotheses of relevant passages at each step, expanding the search space and reducing the risk of missing relevant passages. Moreover, Beam Retrieval jointly optimizes an encoder and two classification heads by minimizing the combined loss across all hops. To establish a complete QA system, we incorporate a supervised reader or a zero-shot GPT-3.5. Experimental results demonstrate that Beam Retrieval achieves a nearly 50% improvement compared with baseli",

    "translated_abstract": "多阶段问答涉及查找多个相关文段和逐步推理以回答复杂问题。虽然先前的方法已经开发了用于选择相关文段的检索模块，但是它们在超过两个阶段的场景中面临挑战，原因是一步方法的性能有限，两步方法在早期阶段选择无关文段时失败。在本研究中，我们介绍了Beam Retrieval，这是一个通用的多阶段问答的端到端检索框架。该方法在每个阶段保持多个相关文段的假设，扩展了搜索空间，降低了错过相关文段的风险。此外，Beam Retrieval通过最小化所有阶段的组合损失来联合优化编码器和两个分类头。为了建立一个完整的问答系统，我们引入了一个有监督的阅读器或零-shot GPT-3.5。实验结果表明，与基准方法相比，Beam Retrieval取得了近50%的改进效果。",
