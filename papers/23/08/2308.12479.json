    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了政府采购对消费者、制造商和政府在社会福利计划中的影响。我们分析了美国婴儿配方奶粉市场，其中超过一半的销售额由妇女、婴儿和儿童（WIC）计划购买。WIC计划利用一级价格竞标从三家主要奶粉制造商那里获取回扣，赢家将独家为获胜州内的所有WIC消费者提供服务。制造商在提供回扣方面竞争激烈，回扣占批发价格的约85%。为了解释和解开导致这一现象的因素，我们通过引入两个独特的特征，即价格不弹性的WIC消费者和WIC品牌价格的政府监管，模拟了制造商的零售定价竞争。我们的研究结果证实了赢得竞标的三个巨大优势: 对非-WIC需求的显着溢出效应、显著的边际成本降低和更高的零售价格。",
