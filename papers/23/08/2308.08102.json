    "translated_abstract": "在Papert（1980）提出儿童与计算机对话的思想的基础上，我们提出了ChatLogo，一个以混合自然编程语言为基础的代理模型和编程的界面。我们在ABM&P学习的支持和利用大型语言模型（LLM）支持计算编程学习的最新发展的基础上进行了构建。ChatLogo旨在支持自然语言和编程语言的混合对话，为初学者提供更友好的界面，并避免技术系统过度依赖任何单一的LLM。我们介绍了我们设计的主要元素：智能指令中心和支持创造性表达的对话界面。我们讨论了演示格式和未来的工作。针对支持开放式建构主义ABM&P学习和利用LLM进行教育目的的挑战，我们通过提出第一个建构主义LLM驱动的界面，对该领域做出了贡献。",
