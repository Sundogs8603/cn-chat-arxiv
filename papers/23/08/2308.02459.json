    "translated_abstract": "开发能够实现灵巧的非抓取平面操作的机器人控制器是具有挑战性的。问题的欠驱动和混合动力学特性，再加上摩擦力交互所产生的不确定性，需要复杂的控制行为。强化学习（RL）是开发此类机器人控制器的强大框架。然而，先前的RL文献解决非抓取推动任务时的准确性低、轨迹不平滑，并且仅实现简单的运动，即不旋转被操作的对象。我们推测之前使用的单模态探索策略无法捕捉任务的混合动力学特性，因为机器人和物体之间可能存在不同的接触交互模式，如粘着、滑动和分离。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种通过分类分布进行多模态探索的方法，使我们能够训练出平滑且准确的非抓取平面操作控制器。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes a multimodal categorical exploration approach that can train a smooth and accurate controller for nonprehensile planar manipulation. This approach captures the hybrid-dynamics of the task and solves the issue of low accuracy and non-smooth trajectories in previous unimodal exploration strategies."
