    "abstract": "We present a study of the short maturity asymptotics for Asian options in a jump-diffusion model with a local volatility component, where the jumps are modeled as a compound Poisson process which are later extended to L\\'evy jumps, that includes the exponential L\\'{e}vy model as a special case. Both fixed and floating strike Asian options are considered. Explicit results are obtained for the first-order asymptotics of the Asian options prices for a few popular models in the literature: the Merton jump-diffusion model, the double-exponential jump model, and the Variance Gamma model. We propose an analytical approximation for Asian option prices which satisfies the constraints from the short-maturity asymptotics, and test it against Monte Carlo simulations. The asymptotic results are in good agreement with numerical simulations for sufficiently small maturity.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们在一个具有局部波动率分量的跳跃扩散模型中，研究了亚洲期权的短期期权渐近性。跳动被建模为复合泊松过程，并扩展为包括指数Lévy模型的Lévy跳动。我们考虑了固定和浮动行权的亚洲期权。我们得到了文献中几个流行模型的亚洲期权价格一阶渐近性的显式结果：Merton跳跃扩散模型、双指数跳跃模型和方差伽玛模型。我们提出了一个满足短期期权渐近性约束的亚洲期权价格的解析近似，然后对其进行蒙特卡洛模拟。渐近结果与数值模拟在足够小的短期期限下具有良好的一致性。",

The authors provide explicit results for the first-order asymptotics of Asian option prices in several popular models, and propose an analytical approximation method that satisfies the constraints from short-maturity asymptotics. The asymptotic results are in good agreement with numerical simulations."
