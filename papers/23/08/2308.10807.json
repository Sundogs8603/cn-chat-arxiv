    "abstract": "Ensemble methods are commonly used in classification due to their remarkable performance. Achieving high accuracy in a data stream environment is a challenging task considering disruptive changes in the data distribution, also known as concept drift. A greater diversity of ensemble components is known to enhance prediction accuracy in such settings. Despite the diversity of components within an ensemble, not all contribute as expected to its overall performance. This necessitates a method for selecting components that exhibit high performance and diversity. We present a novel ensemble construction and maintenance approach based on MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) that dynamically combines the diversity and prediction accuracy of components during the process of structuring an ensemble. The experimental results on both four real and 11 synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach (DynED) provides a higher average mean accuracy compared to the five state-of-the-art baselines",

    "translated_abstract": "鉴于数据分布的突变性变化，也称为概念漂移，在数据流环境中实现高准确度是一项具有挑战性的任务。在这种情况下，集合方法被广泛应用于分类，因为它们具有出色的性能。 在集合内部的更大多样性已被证明可以提高预测准确性。尽管集合内组件的多样性很高，但并不是所有组件都像预期的那样对整体性能有所贡献。这需要一种方法来选择展现出高性能和多样性的组件。我们提出了一种基于MMR（最大边际相关性）的新型集合构建和维护方法，在组合集合的过程中动态地结合了组件的多样性和预测准确性。在四个真实和11个合成数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的方法（DynED）相比于五种最先进的基准方法提供了更高的平均准确率",
