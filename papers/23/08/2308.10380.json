    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种使用大型语言模型（LLM）以自然对话的方式解决个性化能源相关问题的方法。我们专注于可定制的优化问题，这些问题需要反复解决，并且在建模上有轻微的变化，并且是用户特定的，因此对于制定一种适合所有用户的模型是一个挑战。我们提出了一种策略，将优化求解器与LLM相结合，增强其理解和响应用户规范和偏好的能力，同时提供非线性推理能力。我们的方法开创了人导向的优化自动形式化的新概念，将自然语言任务规范自动翻译为优化实例。这使得LLM能够分析、解释和解决各种与实例相关的能源问题，突破了当前基于提示的技术的限制。我们的研究涵盖了能源领域的各种常见任务，从电力到...",
