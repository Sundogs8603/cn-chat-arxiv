    "translated_abstract": "领域适应旨在减少模型在训练数据（源域）与使用数据（目标域）之间的领域差异。当一个深度学习模型部署在空中平台上时，它在运行过程中可能会遇到逐渐恶化的天气条件，导致训练数据与实际评估数据之间的领域差距扩大。本文在两个现有的空中图像数据集上从实际图像中合成了两种逐渐恶化的天气条件，生成了四个基准数据集。在连续或测试时间适应的设置下，我们评估了三种领域适应模型：一个基线标准领域适应模型和两个连续领域适应模型。在这种设置下，模型每次只能访问一小部分或一个批次的目标数据，并且适应只发生在一次数据迭代中。不断适应的约束和逐渐恶化的天气条件的结合，对模型的性能有重要影响。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了在空中图像上进行连续适应的问题，特别关注了模型在逐渐恶化的天气条件下的适应能力。在实验中，作者合成了多个数据集模拟逐渐恶化的天气条件，并评估了不同的领域适应模型的性能。研究结果表明，不断适应的约束对模型的性能有重要影响。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the problem of continual adaptation on aerial images, with a focus on the model's ability to adapt under gradually degrading weather conditions. The authors synthesized multiple datasets to simulate worsening weather conditions and evaluated the performance of different domain adaptation models. The results show that the constraints of continual adaptation have a significant impact on the model's performance."
