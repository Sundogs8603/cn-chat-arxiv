    "translated_abstract": "在各种在线平台上出现大量的假评论已经成为消费者和企业的重大关切。这样的评论可以欺骗消费者，并对产品或服务的声誉造成损害，因此识别它们至关重要。虽然在英语语言中已经广泛研究了假评论的检测，但在孟加拉语等非英语语言中检测假评论仍然是一个相对未开发的研究领域。本文介绍了孟加拉假评论检测（BFRD）数据集，这是第一个公开可用的用于识别孟加拉假评论的数据集。该数据集由从社交媒体帖子中收集到的7710条非假和1339条假的与食品相关的评论组成。为了将评论中的非孟加拉词语转换，提出了一种独特的流水线，将英语单词转换为其对应的孟加拉意义，同时也将罗马化的孟加拉语回音到孟加拉语。我们使用多个深度学习和预训练模型进行了严格的实验。",
