LaCAM* is a scalable search-based algorithm that guarantees the eventual finding of optimal solutions for cumulative transition costs. While it has demonstrated remarkable planning success rates, surpassing various state-of-the-art MAPF methods, its initial solution quality is far from optimal, and its convergence speed to the optimum is slow. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces several improvement techniques, partly drawing inspiration from other MAPF methods. We provide empirical evidence that the fusion of these techniques significantly improves the solution quality of LaCAM*, thus further pushing the boundaries of MAPF algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过对最近提出的LaCAM*算法的改进，解决了实时、大规模和接近最优的多智能体路径规划(MAPF)的挑战。LaCAM*是一种可扩展的基于搜索的算法，它保证对于累计转移成本能够最终找到最优解决方案。尽管它表现出了显著的规划成功率，超过了各种最先进的MAPF方法，但其初始解决方案的质量远非最优，并且其收敛速度较慢。为了克服这些局限性，本文引入了一些改进技术，部分借鉴了其他MAPF方法的灵感。我们提供了实证证据，证明这些技术的融合显著提高了LaCAM*的解决方案质量，进一步推动了MAPF算法的边界。",
