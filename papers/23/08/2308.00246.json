    "translated_abstract": "认知负荷是完成任务所需的心理努力量，在性能和决策结果中起着重要作用，因此在各种敏感领域中分类和分析认知负荷至关重要。本文提出了一种利用脑电图（EEG）分类认知负荷的新解决方案。我们的模型采用了一种变压器架构，利用情绪和认知负荷之间的迁移学习。我们使用自监督掩蔽自编码在情绪相关的EEG数据集上进行预训练，并使用冻结权重和微调进行迁移学习，进行下游的认知负荷分类。为了评估我们的方法，我们进行了一系列实验，利用了两个公开可用的基于EEG的情绪数据集，即SEED和SEED-IV，进行预训练，同时我们使用CL-Drive数据集进行下游的认知负荷分类。我们实验的结果表明，我们提出的方法取得了良好的结果。",
