    "abstract": "Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention-based encoder decoder (AED) joint training has been widely applied in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Unlike most hybrid models that separately calculate the CTC and AED losses, our proposed integrated-CTC utilizes the attention mechanism of AED to guide the output of CTC. In this paper, we employ two fusion methods, namely direct addition of logits (DAL) and preserving the maximum probability (PMP). We achieve dimensional consistency by adaptively affine transforming the attention results to match the dimensions of CTC. To accelerate model convergence and improve accuracy, we introduce auxiliary loss regularization for accelerated convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that the DAL method performs better in attention rescoring, while the PMP method excels in CTC prefix beam search and greedy search.",

    "translated_abstract": "连接主义时间分类（CTC）和基于注意力编码器解码器（AED）的联合训练已广泛应用于自动语音识别（ASR）。与大多数分开计算CTC和AED损失的混合模型不同，我们提出的集成CTC利用AED的注意力机制来指导CTC的输出。本文采用两种融合方法，即直接相加的logits（DAL）和保留最大概率（PMP）。通过自适应仿射变换注意结果以匹配CTC的维度，我们实现了维度一致性。为了加快模型收敛速度和提高准确性，我们引入了辅助损失正则化以加速收敛。实验结果表明，DAL方法在注意力重评分上表现更好，而PMP方法在CTC前缀搜索和贪婪搜索中表现卓越。",
