    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个新颖的框架，利用交互式问答来识别代理人的风险规避。我们的研究在两种情景中进行：一期情景和无限期情景。在一期情景中，我们假设代理人的风险规避由状态的成本函数和失真风险度量所表征。在无限期情景中，我们用一个额外的成分，折扣因子，来建模风险规避。假设我们可以访问一个包含代理人真实风险规避的有限候选集，我们证明通过要求代理人在各种环境中展示她的最优政策来回答问题，这可以有效地识别代理人的风险规避。具体而言，我们证明了当问题的数量趋近无穷大并且问题是随机设计的时候，可以识别出代理人的风险规避。我们还开发了一个算法用于设计最优问题，并提供了实证证据来支持我们的方法。",

The method is effective in both one-period and infinite horizon scenarios, by asking the agent to demonstrate optimal policies in various environments through randomly designed questions.
