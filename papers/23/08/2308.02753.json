    "translated_abstract": "自我训练在领域适应中成为一个重要的研究方向。通过将模型的预测作为无标签数据的伪标签，自我训练利用目标领域中的伪实例来引导模型。然而，伪标签的预测错误（标签噪声）挑战了自我训练的性能。为了解决这个问题，先前的方法只使用可靠的伪实例，即具有高预测置信度的伪实例来重新训练模型。虽然这些策略有效地减少了标签噪声，但容易错过困难的例子。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的领域适应自我训练框架，即领域对抗学习增强自我训练框架（DaMSTF）。首先，DaMSTF通过元学习估计每个伪实例的重要性，以同时减少标签噪声和保留困难的例子。其次，我们设计了一个元构造器来构造元验证堆栈。",
