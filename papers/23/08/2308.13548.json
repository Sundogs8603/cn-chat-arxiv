    "abstract": "We introduce Infinitia, a simulation game system that uses generative image and language models at play time to reshape all aspects of the setting and NPCs based on a short description from the player, in a way similar to how settings are created on the fictional Holodeck. Building off the ideas of the Generative Agents paper, our system introduces gameplay elements, such as infinite generated fantasy worlds, controllability of NPC behavior, humorous dialogue, cost & time efficiency, collaboration between players and elements of non-determinism among in-game events. Infinitia is implemented in the Unity engine with a server-client architecture, facilitating the addition of exciting features by community developers in the future. Furthermore, it uses a multiplayer framework to allow humans to be present and interact in the simulation. The simulation will be available in open-alpha shortly at https://infinitia.ai/ and we are looking forward to building upon it with the community.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了Infinitia，一个模拟游戏系统，在游戏时间内使用生成图像和语言模型根据玩家的简短描述重新塑造游戏场景和NPC，类似于虚构的全息舱中创建设置的方式。基于《生成代理》论文的思想，我们的系统引入了游戏性元素，如无限生成的幻想世界，NPC行为的可控性，幽默对话，成本和时间效率，玩家之间的合作以及游戏内事件的非确定性元素。Infinitia使用Unity引擎实现了服务器-客户端架构，方便未来社区开发者加入令人兴奋的功能。此外，它使用了多人框架，允许玩家在模拟中存在并进行交互。模拟将很快在https://infinitia.ai/上提供开放式测试版，并且我们期待与社区共同进步。",
