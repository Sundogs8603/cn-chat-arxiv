    "translated_abstract": "细胞核图像分割是分析、病理诊断和分类的关键步骤，它严重依赖于细胞核分割的质量。然而，细胞核尺寸的变化、模糊的细胞核轮廓、染色不均匀、细胞团聚和细胞重叠等问题的复杂性带来了重大挑战。当前的细胞核分割方法主要依赖于核形态学或基于轮廓的方法。基于核形态学的方法具有有限的泛化能力，对于预测不规则形状的细胞核效果有限，而基于轮廓提取的方法在准确分割重叠的细胞核方面面临困难。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了一个使用混合注意力和残差U块的双分支网络，用于细胞核实例分割。该网络同时预测目标信息和目标轮廓。此外，我们还引入了一种后处理方法，将目标信息与目标轮廓相结合。",
