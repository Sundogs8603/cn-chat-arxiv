    "translated_abstract": "推荐模型通过利用广泛的用户行为数据来提供领域特定的物品推荐，展现出轻量级领域专家的能力。然而，它们在提供解释和参与对话等多样化任务方面存在困难。另一方面，大型语言模型（LLMs）代表了人工通用智能的重要进展，在指令理解、常识推理和人类交互方面表现出了显著能力。然而，LLMs缺乏领域特定物品目录和行为模式的知识，特别是在与一般世界知识不同的领域，如在线电子商务。为每个领域微调LLMs既不经济又不高效。在本文中，我们将推荐模型和LLMs之间的差距，结合各自的优势，创建了一个多功能交互式推荐系统。我们引入了一个高效的框架称为RecAgent，该框架使用LLMs",
