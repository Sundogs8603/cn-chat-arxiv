    "translated_abstract": "长距离传感器获取的高光谱测量数据可以给出场景中物品、材料和化学品的详细情况，但由于先进传感器的高空间和光谱分辨率，分析变得困难、缓慢和昂贵。因此，稀疏性对于实现光谱压缩和分析的未来非常重要。已经观察到环境和大气效应，包括散射，会产生非线性效应，对于现有的源分离和压缩方法构成挑战。我们提出了一种新的转换方法，通过非负最小二乘优化在希尔伯特空间中进行修剪和构建稀疏表示。然后，我们引入了最大似然压缩向量来减少信息损失。我们的方法与标准修剪和最小二乘以及深度学习方法进行了基准测试。我们使用真实和合成数据评估了我们的方法，考察了总体光谱重建误差和压缩速率。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a reproducing kernel Hilbert space pruning method for sparse hyperspectral abundance prediction. It constructs sparse representations through non-negative least squares optimization and introduces maximum likelihood compression vectors to reduce information loss. Evaluation results show that the proposed method outperforms standard pruning, least squares, and deep learning methods in terms of spectral reconstruction error and compression rate."
