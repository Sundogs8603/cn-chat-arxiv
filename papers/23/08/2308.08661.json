    "abstract": "Many open-domain questions are under-specified and thus have multiple possible answers, each of which is correct under a different interpretation of the question. Answering such ambiguous questions is challenging, as it requires retrieving and then reasoning about diverse information from multiple passages. We present a new state-of-the-art for answering ambiguous questions that exploits a database of unambiguous questions generated from Wikipedia. On the challenging ASQA benchmark, which requires generating long-form answers that summarize the multiple answers to an ambiguous question, our method improves performance by 15% (relative improvement) on recall measures and 10% on measures which evaluate disambiguating questions from predicted outputs. Retrieving from the database of generated questions also gives large improvements in diverse passage retrieval (by matching user questions q to passages p indirectly, via questions q' generated from p).",

    "translated_abstract": "许多开放领域的问题都没有明确的规定，因此可能有多个可能的答案，每个答案在问题的不同解释下都是正确的。回答这样模糊的问题具有挑战性，因为它需要从多个段落中检索并推理出不同的信息。我们提出了一种新的回答模糊问题的最新技术，利用从维基百科生成的一组明确问题的数据库。在具有挑战性的ASQA基准测试中，我们的方法在召回率测量上提高了15%（相对改进），在评估从预测输出中消除歧义问题的度量上提高了10%。从生成的问题数据库中检索还大大提高了多样的段落检索（通过间接匹配用户问题q到段落p，通过从p生成的问题q'）。",
