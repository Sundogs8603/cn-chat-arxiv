    "translated_abstract": "布尔可满足性（SAT）和可满足性模型理论（SMT）在自动验证中被广泛应用，但在这个领域缺乏专门用于教育目的的交互式工具。为了填补这个空白，我们提出了EduSAT，这是一个专门为支持SAT和SMT求解的学习和理解而开发的教学工具。EduSAT提供了关键算法的实现，如Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland（DPLL）算法和简化的二进制决策图（ROBDD）用于SAT求解。此外，EduSAT还为SAT和SMT之外的五个NP完全问题提供求解器抽象。用户可以通过使用EduSAT进行实验、分析和验证对SAT和SMT求解技术的理解。我们的工具配有全面的文档和教程，广泛的测试，以及实用的功能，如自然语言界面和SAT和SMT公式生成器，这也为学习者提供了宝贵的机会。",
