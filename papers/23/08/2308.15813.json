Recently, research has focused on generating natural language explanations in a human-readable format. Thus far, the proposed approaches leverage item reviews written by users, which are often subjective, sparse in language, and unable to account for new items that have not been purchased or reviewed before. Instead, we aim to generate fact-grounded recommendation explanations that are objectively described with item features while implicitly considering a user's preferences, based on the user's purchase history. To achieve this, we propose a knowledge graph (KG) approach to natural language explainable recommendation. Our approach draws on user-item features through a novel collaborative filtering-based KG representation to produce fact-grounded, personalized explanations, while jointly learning",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统的决策辅助用户理解的解释可以提高用户对系统的信心和信任。最近的研究主要集中在以人类可读的形式生成自然语言解释。然而，目前提出的方法往往利用用户编写的物品评论，这些评论通常主观，语言贫乏，并且无法涵盖未被购买或评论的新物品。相反，我们的目标是根据用户的购买历史，生成以物品特征客观描述的基于事实的推荐解释，并隐含考虑用户的偏好。为了实现这一目标，我们提出了一个基于知识图谱的自然语言可解释推荐方法。我们的方法通过一种新颖的基于协同过滤的知识图谱表示，利用用户-物品特征产生基于事实的个性化解释，同时进行联合学习。",
