    "translated_abstract": "本文开发了一类一般矩函数的幂级数展开，包括连续时间马尔可夫过程（包括跳跃扩散）的转移密度和期权价格。该提议的展开将Kristensen和Mele（2011）的展开扩展到涵盖一般的马尔可夫过程。我们证明了这类展开包含了Yang、Chen和Wan（2019）以及Wan和Yang（2021）开发的转移密度和期权价格展开作为特殊情况，从而将看似不同的思想连接在一个统一的框架中。我们展示了如何对完全一般的跳跃扩散模型实施一般的展开。我们提供了一个新的展开有效性理论，表明在一般情况下，级数展开不保证收敛随着更多项的加入。因此，在使用这些方法时应该小心。同时，本文的数值研究证明了所提方法在实践中表现良好，当数据数量较小时。",
