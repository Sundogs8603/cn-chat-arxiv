    "translated_abstract": "现有的多视图聚类方法假设所有视图都是完整的，但实际上由于数据损坏或传感器故障，样本通常是部分可用的，这引发了对不完整多视图聚类的研究。虽然已经提出了一些基于锚点的不完整多视图聚类方法来处理大规模的不完整数据，但它们仍然存在以下缺点：i）大多数现有方法忽视了视图间的差异，强制要求跨视图表示一致，这会破坏模型的表示能力；ii）由于不同视图之间样本的差异，学习到的锚点可能不对齐，我们称之为不完整数据下的锚点不对齐问题（AUP-ID）。这种AUP-ID会导致图融合不准确，降低聚类性能。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的不完整锚点图学习框架，称为可扩展的不完整多视图聚类方法与结构对齐。",
