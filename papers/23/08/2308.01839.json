    "translated_abstract": "单细胞数据整合可以提供细胞的全面分子视图，并且已经开发出许多算法来消除不需要的技术或生物变异，并整合异质的单细胞数据集。尽管这些方法被广泛使用，但现有方法存在一些基本限制。特别是，我们缺乏一种严谨的统计检验方法，用于判断两个高维单细胞数据集是否可以对齐（因此是否应该进行对齐）。此外，流行的方法在对齐过程中可能会明显畸变数据，使得对齐后的数据和下游分析难以解释。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一种基于谱流形对齐和推断（SMAI）框架，该框架可以实现基于原则和可解释的单细胞数据对齐性测试和保持结构的整合。SMAI提供了一种统计检验方法，能够稳健地确定数据集之间的对齐性，以避免误导性推断，同时其方法也经过了高维数据的正当性证明。",
