    "translated_abstract": "无监督域自适应（UDA）近十年来备受关注，但在实际应用中很难使用。考虑到隐私保护问题和安全问题，本文研究了无源域自适应（SFDA）的实际问题，即消除了对标注源数据的依赖。当前的SFDA方法侧重于从源培训模型中提取领域知识，但忽视了目标域的内在结构。此外，它们通常利用伪标签进行目标域的自训练，但受到臭名昭著的误差累积问题的困扰。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的SFDA框架，称为区域到像素自适应网络（RPANet），通过由粗到细的自监督学习方法学习区域级别和像素级别的判别表示。所提出的RPANet包括两个模块，即前景感知的对比学习（FCL）和置信度校准的伪标签训练（CCPLT）。",
