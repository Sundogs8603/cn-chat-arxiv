    "abstract": "This paper presents four examples of different ways that coordinated influence operations exert pressure on the prominence of ideas on social networks. We argue that these examples illustrate the four archetypical paths to influence: promotion by strengthening, promotion by weakening, demotion by strengthening, and demotion by weakening. We formalize this idea in a stylized economic model of the optimal behavior of the influence operator and derive some predictions about when we should expect each path to be followed. Finally we sketch out how one might go about quantitatively estimating the key parameters of (a variant of) this model and how it applies much more broadly than in the international political influence examples that motivate it.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提供了四个不同的例子，展示了协调操作如何对社交网络上的思想显著性施加压力。我们认为这些例子说明了四种典型的影响途径：通过加强推广，通过削弱推广，通过加强贬低，以及通过削弱贬低。我们在一个简单的经济模型中形式化了这个理念，并得出了一些关于何时应该期望遵循每种途径的预测。最后，我们概述了如何定量估算（该模型的变体的）关键参数，并且该模型适用范围远远不止于激发它的国际政治影响的例子。",
