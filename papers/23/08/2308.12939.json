    "translated_abstract": "最近，深度学习替代方案和神经算子在解决偏微分方程(PDEs)方面显示出潜力。然而，它们通常需要大量的训练数据，并且只限于有界域。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的面向物理的神经算子方法，用于解决无标记数据的参数化边界值问题。通过将PDE的重新表述为边界积分方程(BIEs)，我们可以仅在域的边界上训练算子网络。这种方法将所需样本点的数量从$O(N^d)$减少到$O(N^{d-1})$，其中$d$为域的维数，从而显著加速了训练过程。此外，我们的方法可以处理无界问题，对于现有的面向物理的神经网络(PINNs)和神经算子来说是无法实现的。我们的数值实验展示了参数化复杂几何体和无界问题的有效性。",
