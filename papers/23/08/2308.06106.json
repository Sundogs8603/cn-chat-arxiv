    "translated_abstract": "我们旨在基于多元霍克斯过程明确地建模延迟的格兰杰因果效应。这个想法的灵感来自于因果事件通常需要一些时间才能产生影响。研究这个时间延迟本身就很有意义。在提出的模型中，我们首先证明了在适当条件下的延迟参数的可辨识性。我们进一步研究了在复杂情况下的模型估计方法，其中我们希望推断出时间延迟的后验分布，并了解该分布在不同情况下的变化。我们将时间延迟视为潜在变量，并制定了一个变分自编码器（VAE）算法来近似时间延迟的后验分布。通过明确地建模霍克斯过程中的时间延迟，我们为模型增加了灵活性。推断出的时间延迟后验分布具有科学意义，并有助于追踪支持根本原因分析的原始因果时间。我们对模型进行了实证评估。",
