    "translated_abstract": "显而易见，当前大型语言模型(LLMs)的状态需要引入外部工具。已经有大量文献记录了其缺乏直接的代数和逻辑推理，并促使研究人员开发了允许LLMs通过外部工具运行的框架。特定任务的工具利用的本体性质可以用有向无环图(DAG)很好地描述。本文的核心目标是突出强调在不久的将来，基于图的方法对LLM-工具交互的重要性。我们提出了一个示范性框架，用于指导指数级增加的外部工具与LLMs的编排，其中工具的目标和功能以图形方式进行层次结构编码。假设作为定义在这里的工具，思维链(CoT)的文本片段可以被想象为一种工具，那么基于图的框架也可以在这个特定方向上开辟新的途径。",
