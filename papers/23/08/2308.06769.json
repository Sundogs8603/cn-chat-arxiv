    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new approach for change point detection in causal networks of multivariate Hawkes processes using Frechet statistics. Our method splits the point process into overlapping windows, estimates kernel matrices in each window, and reconstructs the signed Laplacians by treating the kernel matrices as the adjacency matrices of the causal network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on both simulated and real-world cryptocurrency datasets. Our results show that our method is capable of accurately detecting and characterizing changes in the causal structure of multivariate Hawkes processes, and may have potential applications in fields such as finance and neuroscience. The proposed method is an extension of previous work on Frechet statistics in point process settings and represents an important contribution to the field of change point detection in multivariate point processes.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种使用Frechet统计方法对多变量Hawkes过程中的因果网络进行变点检测的新方法。我们的方法将点过程分成重叠的窗口，在每个窗口中估计核矩阵，并通过将核矩阵视为因果网络的邻接矩阵来重构有符号的拉普拉斯矩阵。通过在模拟和真实加密货币数据集上进行实验，我们证明了我们的方法的有效性。我们的结果显示，我们的方法能够准确地检测和描述多变量Hawkes过程因果结构中的变化，并在金融和神经科学等领域具有潜在的应用价值。所提出的方法是对点过程设置中Frechet统计之前工作的扩展，并对多变量点过程的变点检测领域做出了重要贡献。",
