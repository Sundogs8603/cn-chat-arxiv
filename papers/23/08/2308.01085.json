    "abstract": "In this paper we show how rule-based decision making can be combined with traditional motion planning techniques to achieve human-like behavior of a self-driving vehicle in complex traffic situations. We give and discuss examples of decision rules in autonomous driving. We draw on these examples to illustrate that developing techniques for spatial awareness of robots is an exciting activity which deserves more attention from spatial reasoning community that it had received so far.",
