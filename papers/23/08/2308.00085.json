    "abstract": "Recent approaches to empathetic response generation try to incorporate commonsense knowledge or reasoning about the causes of emotions to better understand the user's experiences and feelings. However, these approaches mainly focus on understanding the causalities of context from the user's perspective, ignoring the system's perspective. In this paper, we propose a commonsense-based causality explanation approach for diverse empathetic response generation that considers both the user's perspective (user's desires and reactions) and the system's perspective (system's intentions and reactions). We enhance ChatGPT's ability to reason for the system's perspective by integrating in-context learning with commonsense knowledge. Then, we integrate the commonsense-based causality explanation with both ChatGPT and a T5-based model. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms other comparable methods on both automatic and human evaluations.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的共情回应生成方法试图整合常识知识或对情绪原因的推理，以更好地理解用户的经历和感受。然而，这些方法主要关注从用户的角度理解上下文的因果关系，忽略了系统的角度。本文提出了一种基于常识的因果解释方法，用于多样化的共情回应生成，同时考虑用户的角度（用户的欲望和反应）和系统的角度（系统的意图和反应）。我们通过将上下文学习与常识知识相结合，增强了ChatGPT在系统的角度上的推理能力。然后，我们将基于常识的因果解释与ChatGPT和基于T5模型的方法进行整合。实验评估表明，我们的方法在自动评估和人工评估上优于其他可比较的方法。",
