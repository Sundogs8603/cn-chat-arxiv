    "abstract": "Numerical perspectives help people understand extreme and unfamiliar numbers (e.g., \\$330 billion is about \\$1,000 per person in the United States). While research shows perspectives to be helpful, generating them at scale is challenging both because it is difficult to identify what makes some analogies more helpful than others, and because what is most helpful can vary based on the context in which a given number appears. Here we present and compare three policies for large-scale perspective generation: a rule-based approach, a crowdsourced system, and a model that uses Wikipedia data and semantic similarity (via BERT embeddings) to generate context-specific perspectives. We find that the combination of these three approaches dominates any single method, with different approaches excelling in different settings and users displaying heterogeneous preferences across approaches. We conclude by discussing our deployment of perspectives in a widely-used online word processor.",

    "translated_abstract": "数值角度帮助人们理解极端和不熟悉的数值（例如，3300亿美元相当于每个美国人1000美元）。尽管研究表明角度是有帮助的，但要在大规模上生成它们是具有挑战性的，因为很难确定什么使某些类比更有帮助，而且因为最有帮助的因素可能因上下文而异。在这里，我们提出并比较了三种大规模角度生成策略：基于规则的方法、众包系统和使用维基百科数据和语义相似性（通过BERT嵌入）生成特定上下文角度的模型。我们发现这三种方法的组合优于单一方法，不同的方法在不同情境中表现出色，用户对不同方法有异质偏好。我们最后讨论了在广泛使用的在线文字处理器中应用角度的情况。",
