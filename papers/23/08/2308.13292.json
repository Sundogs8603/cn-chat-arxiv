    "translated_abstract": "评估是教育的关键部分。传统的评分方法存在一些问题，如一致性不足，存在无意识的偏见，给评估者带来较大的认知负担。比较评判（CJ）是一种解决这些问题的方法。在CJ中，评估者以一对项目为单位，选择哪个更好。通过一系列比较，可以使用排名模型（例如BTM）推导出一个排名。虽然CJ被认为是一种可靠的评分方法，但仍存在透明度和生成可靠排名所需的对比次数的理想数量等问题。此外，已有尝试提出了一些方法以有效方式选择下一个应比较的项目，但某些现有方法会在结果中产生自己的偏见，从而增加了所使用的可靠性度量。因此，通常使用随机选择的方法。本文提出了一种新颖的基于贝叶斯的方法。",
