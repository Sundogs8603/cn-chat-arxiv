    "translated_abstract": "在过去的四十年里，人们一直致力于开发和评估实证翻译过程研究（TPR）的模型，但一个全面的框架仍然难以捉摸。本文追踪了CRITT TPR-DB传统中实证TPR的发展，并提出了自由能原理（FEP）和主动推理（AIF）作为建模深嵌入式翻译过程的框架。它引入了量化关联理论（相关性，s-mode，i-mode）基本概念的新方法，并建立了它们与监控模型的关系，将关联性最大化定为最小化自由能的特例。FEP/AIF提供了一个数学严谨的基础，可以建模不同时间线上展开的嵌入式翻译过程的深层时间架构。这个框架为预测性TPR的未来研究开辟了令人兴奋的前景，有望丰富我们对人类翻译过程的理解，并为实践提供了宝贵的参考。",
