In this paper, we learn the evolution of such non-stationary dynamical systems using a novel recurrent neural operator (RNO), which learns mappings between function spaces.

    "translated_abstract": "翻车点是非平稳和混沌动力系统演化中的突变、剧烈且常常不可逆的变化。例如，预计温室气体浓度的增加会导致低云覆盖的急剧减少，被称为气候学的翻车点。在本文中，我们利用一种新颖的循环神经算子（RNO）学习这种非平稳动力系统的演化，RNO可以学习函数空间之间的映射关系。在仅训练RNO在翻车点之前的动力学数据之后，我们采用基于不确定性的方法来检测未来的翻车点。具体而言，我们提出了一个符合预测框架，通过监测与物理约束（如守恒量和偏微分方程）偏离来预测翻车点，从而使得对这些突变的预测伴随着一种严格的不确定性度量。我们将我们提出的方法应用于非平稳常微分方程和偏微分方程的案例。",
