    "translated_abstract": "3D场景图以层次方式适当地组织不同的环境实体。我们之前的工作在SLAM中将3D场景图的概念扩展到了情境图，通过紧密地将机器人姿态与场景图实体相结合，实现了最先进的结果。然而，S-Graphs的一个限制是在真正大的环境中的可扩展性，由于随时间增长图的大小增加，计算复杂性增加。为了克服这个限制，在这项工作中，我们介绍了一个改进版本的S-Graphs的初步研究，利用层次性来减小图的大小，通过边缘化冗余的机器人姿态及其与相同结构实体的观测之间的连接。首先，我们提出了在类似房间的结构中包含所有图实体的局部图的生成和优化。这些局部图用于压缩S-Graphs，边缘化冗余的机器人关键帧及其与观测之间的连接。",
