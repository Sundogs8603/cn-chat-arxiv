    "translated_abstract": "尽管通过对话系统技术竞赛（DSTC）取得了显著进展，但构建一个具有语音界面的稳健的任务导向对话系统仍然是一个关键挑战。大部分进展都是针对基于文本的对话系统，因为有丰富的书面语料库数据集，而具有口语对话的数据集非常稀缺。然而，正如Siri和Alexa等语音助手系统所展示的，将这种成功转移到口语对话中具有实际重要性。在本文中，我们描述了我们在DSTC11的具有语音感知的对话系统技术挑战赛中的高度成功模型的工程努力。我们的模型由三个主要模块组成：（1）自动语音识别错误校正，以弥合口语和文本话语之间的差距，（2）用于估计插槽和值的基于文本的对话系统（D3ST），该系统使用插槽描述。",
