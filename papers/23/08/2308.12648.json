    "translated_abstract": "对话中的情感识别（ERC）是构建类似人类对话代理的关键任务。尽管在闲聊对话方面已经做出了大量努力，但任务导向的对话中的ERC仍然几乎没有得到关注。直接将闲聊ERC模型应用于任务导向的对话（ToDs）会导致性能不佳，因为这些模型忽视了ToDs中情感与任务完成之间的关联。在本文中，我们提出了一个框架，将闲聊ERC模型转变为任务导向型，解决了三个关键方面：数据、特征和目标。首先，我们设计了两种增加罕见情感的方法来提高ERC性能。其次，我们使用对话状态作为辅助特征，将用户目标的关键信息整合进来。最后，我们利用ToDs中的多方面情感定义，设计了一个多任务学习目标和一种新颖的情感距离加权损失函数。我们的框架取得了显著的成果。",
