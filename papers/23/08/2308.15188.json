    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在完全可观察的非确定性领域中，使用线性时态逻辑在有限轨迹上表达目标的最佳努力策略（也称为计划）。最佳努力策略的概念被引入来应对当不存在一个代理策略能满足每个可能的非确定性环境反应的情况。这样的策略在可能的情况下实现目标，并在否则的情况下尽力而为。我们提出了一种利用非确定性规划领域特征综合最佳努力策略的博弈论技术。我们在理论上证明了它的正确性，并通过实验证明了它的有效性，相对于基于将规划领域重新表达为通用环境规范的直接最佳努力综合方法具有更高的可扩展性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies best-effort strategies in fully observable nondeterministic planning domains using Linear Temporal Logic on Finite Traces (LTLf) goals. A game-theoretic technique is proposed to synthesize these strategies, which takes advantage of the specificity of nondeterministic planning domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach has higher scalability compared to a direct synthesis approach based on re-expressing the planning domain."
