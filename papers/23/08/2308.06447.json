    "translated_abstract": "物理信息神经网络（PINNs）通过将物理定律融入神经网络的训练中，已经在解决非线性偏微分方程（PDEs）方面变得越来越流行，并在许多科学和工程应用中表现出优越性。然而，传统的PINNs在准确逼近具有强非线性的复杂系统的解方面仍然存在一定的局限性，尤其是在长时间域下。此外，由于PINNs被设计为逼近给定PDE系统的特定实现，它们缺乏必要的通用性来有效适应新系统配置。这就需要在系统发生任何变化时进行从头重新训练，计算成本较高。为了解决这些问题，在这项工作中提出了一种新颖的顺序元转移（SMT）学习框架，为高度非线性系统的PINNs提供了快速训练和高效适应的统一解决方案。",
