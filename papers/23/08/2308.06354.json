    "abstract": "Social determinants of health (SDoH) have an important impact on patient outcomes but are incompletely collected from the electronic health records (EHR). This study researched the ability of large language models to extract SDoH from free text in EHRs, where they are most commonly documented, and explored the role of synthetic clinical text for improving the extraction of these scarcely documented, yet extremely valuable, clinical data. 800 patient notes were annotated for SDoH categories, and several transformer-based models were evaluated. The study also experimented with synthetic data generation and assessed for algorithmic bias. Our best-performing models were fine-tuned Flan-T5 XL (macro-F1 0.71) for any SDoH, and Flan-T5 XXL (macro-F1 0.70). The benefit of augmenting fine-tuning with synthetic data varied across model architecture and size, with smaller Flan-T5 models (base and large) showing the greatest improvements in performance (delta F1 +0.12 to +0.23).

    "translated_abstract": "社会健康决定因素（SDoH）对患者的结果有重要影响，但在电子健康记录（EHR）中的收集不完整。本研究研究了大型语言模型从EHR中提取SDoH的能力，并探讨了合成临床文本在改进这些少见但极有价值的临床数据提取中的作用。对800份患者记录进行了SDoH类别的注释，并评估了几个基于transformer的模型。本研究还尝试了合成数据生成，并评估了算法偏差。我们表现最佳的模型是经过微调的Flan-T5 XL（macro-F1 0.71）用于任何SDoH，以及Flan-T5 XXL（macro-F1 0.70）。通过合成数据辅助微调的效益因模型架构和大小而异，在较小的Flan-T5模型（基础和大型）中表现出最大的性能提升（delta F1 +0.12到+0.23）。模型性能。",
