    "abstract": "How do we design an AI system that is intended to act as a communication bridge between two user communities with different mental models and vocabularies? Skillsync is an interactive environment that engages employers (companies) and training providers (colleges) in a sustained dialogue to help them achieve the goal of building a training proposal that successfully meets the needs of the employers and employees. We used a variation of participatory design to elicit requirements for developing AskJill, a question-answering agent that explains how Skillsync works and thus acts as a communication bridge between company and college users. Our study finds that participatory design was useful in guiding the requirements gathering and eliciting user questions for the development of AskJill. Our results also suggest that the two Skillsync user communities perceived glossary assistance as a key feature that AskJill needs to offer, and they would benefit from such a shared vocabulary.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们如何设计一个旨在充当两个具有不同心智模型和词汇的用户社区之间沟通桥梁的AI系统？ Skillsync是一个交互环境，通过持续的对话将雇主（公司）和培训提供者（大学）引入其中，帮助他们实现建立能够成功满足雇主和员工需求的培训提案的目标。我们采用了一种参与式设计的变体，以征求开发AskJill的需求，AskJill是一个解释Skillsync工作原理的问答代理，因此充当了企业和学院用户之间的沟通桥梁。我们的研究发现，参与式设计在指导需求收集和引发用户问题以开发AskJill方面非常有用。我们的结果还表明，两个Skillsync用户社区认为词汇表辅助是AskJill需要提供的关键功能，他们会受益于这样一个共享词汇。",
