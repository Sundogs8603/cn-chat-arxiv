    "translated_abstract": "麦克斯韦方程是一组耦合的偏微分方程（PDEs），与洛伦兹力法则一起构成了经典电磁学和电路的基础。在诸如电磁散射和天线设计优化等领域中，有效求解麦克斯韦方程至关重要。物理知识导向的神经网络（PINNs）在求解PDEs方面表现出强大的能力。然而，PINNs在异质介质中求解麦克斯韦方程仍存在困难。为此，我们提出了一种面向域自适应的PINN（da-PINN），用于求解异质介质下麦克斯韦方程的反问题。首先，我们提出介质界面的位置参数，将整个域分解为多个子域。此外，将电磁界面条件结合到损失函数中，以提高接近界面处的预测性能。然后，我们提出了一种面向域自适应的训练策略用于da-PINN。最后，我们验证了da-PINN的有效性。",
