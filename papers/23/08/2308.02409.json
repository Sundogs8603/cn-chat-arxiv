    "abstract": "The human brain is in a continuous state of activity during both work and rest. Mental activity is a daily process, and when the brain is overworked, it can have negative effects on human health. In recent years, great attention has been paid to early detection of mental health problems because it can help prevent serious health problems and improve quality of life. Several signals are used to assess mental state, but the electroencephalogram (EEG) is widely used by researchers because of the large amount of information it provides about the brain. This paper aims to classify mental workload into three states and estimate continuum levels. Our method combines multiple dimensions of space to achieve the best results for mental estimation. In the time domain approach, we use Temporal Convolutional Networks, and in the frequency domain, we propose a new architecture called the Multi-Dimensional Residual Block, which combines residual blocks.",

    "translated_abstract": "人脑在工作和休息时都处于持续活动的状态。心理活动是日常过程中的一部分，当大脑过度劳累时，会对人体健康产生负面影响。近年来，人们对于早期检测心理健康问题的重视逐渐增加，因为这可以帮助预防严重的健康问题，并改善生活质量。多种信号被用于评估心理状态，但由于大量提供关于大脑信息的特点，脑电图（EEG）被研究人员广泛使用。本文旨在将心理负荷分为三种状态并估计连续级别。我们的方法通过融合多个空间维度来实现最佳的心理估计结果。在时间域方法中，我们使用了时态卷积网络，而在频率域上，我们提出了一种名为多维残差块的新架构，它结合了残差块。",
