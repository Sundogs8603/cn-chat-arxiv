    "abstract": "Diverse, top-k, and top-quality planning are concerned with the generation of sets of solutions to sequential decision problems. Previously this area has been the domain of classical planners that require a symbolic model of the problem instance. This paper proposes a novel alternative approach that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), enabling application to problems for which only a black-box simulation model is available. We present a procedure for extracting bounded sets of plans from pre-generated search trees in best-first order, and a metric for evaluating the relative quality of paths through a search tree. We demonstrate this approach on a path-planning problem with hidden information, and suggest adaptations to the MCTS algorithm to increase the diversity of generated plans. Our results show that our method can generate diverse and high-quality plan sets in domains where classical planners are not applicable.",

    "translated_abstract": "多样化、前k个和高质量的规划关注的是生成顺序决策问题的解集。以往这个领域是传统规划器的领域，需要一个问题实例的符号模型。本文提出了一种新颖的替代方法，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS），使其适用于只有黑箱模拟模型的问题。我们提出了从预生成的最优搜索树中提取有界规划集的过程，以及评估通过搜索树的路径相对质量的度量标准。我们在具有隐藏信息的路径规划问题上展示了这种方法，并建议修改MCTS算法以增加生成规划的多样性。我们的结果表明，我们的方法可以在传统规划器不适用的领域生成多样化和高质量的规划集。",
