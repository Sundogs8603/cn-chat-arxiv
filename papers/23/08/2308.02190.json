    "translated_abstract": "跨语料库语音情感识别旨在将推断语音情感的能力从一个有标签的语料库推广到一个无标签的语料库，这是一个非常具有挑战性的任务，因为两个语料库之间存在显著差异。现有的方法通常基于无监督领域适应（UDA），通过全局分布对齐来努力学习语料库不变的特征，但不幸的是，所得特征混合了语料库特定的特征或不具有类别鉴别性。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种全新的Emotion Decoupling aNd Alignment（EMO-DNA）跨语料库语音情感识别学习框架，一种新颖的UDA方法，用于学习与情感相关的语料库不变特征。EMO-DNA的创新之处在于对比情感解耦和双层情感对齐。一方面，我们通过对比解耦损失实现对比学习，增强了情感相关特征与语料库之间的可分离性。",
