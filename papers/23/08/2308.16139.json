    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了MedShapeNet，一个包含了解剖形状（如骨骼、器官、血管）和三维手术器械模型的大型数据集。在深度学习时代之前，统计形状模型在医学图像分析中的广泛应用证明了形状常被用来描述医学数据。然而，当前医学图像领域的最先进深度学习算法主要是基于体素的。相反，在计算机视觉领域，形状（包括体素占据网格、网格、点云和隐式表面模型）是三维数据的首选表示方法，这一点可以从大量关于形状的文章及在顶级计算机视觉会议（如IEEE/CVF计算机视觉与模式识别会议（CVPR））中见到，同时ShapeNet（约51300个模型）和普林斯顿ModelNet（127,915个模型）的流行度也在不断增加。MedShapeNet的创建是为了作为这些常用形状基准的替代品。",
