    "translated_abstract": "大语言模型(LLMs)已经成为文本到SQL任务的一种新范式。然而，缺乏一个系统性的基准阻碍了设计有效、高效和经济的LLM-based文本到SQL解决方案的发展。为了解决这一挑战，本文首先对现有的提示工程方法进行了系统性和广泛的比较，包括问题表示、示例选择和示例组织，并根据实验结果详细阐述了它们的优缺点。基于这些发现，我们提出了一种新的集成解决方案，名为DAIL-SQL，刷新了Spider榜单，达到了86.6%的执行准确率，建立了一个新的标杆。为了实现高效经济的LLM-based文本到SQL解决方案，我们强调提示工程中的词汇效率，并在此度量下比较了之前的研究。此外，我们还研究了上下文学习中的开源LLMs，并用任务特定的监督进行了进一步的性能优化。",
