    "abstract": "Sparse variational approximations are popular methods for scaling up inference and learning in Gaussian processes to larger datasets. For $N$ training points, exact inference has $O(N^3)$ cost; with $M \\ll N$ features, state of the art sparse variational methods have $O(NM^2)$ cost. Recently, methods have been proposed using more sophisticated features; these promise $O(M^3)$ cost, with good performance in low dimensional tasks such as spatial modelling, but they only work with a very limited class of kernels, excluding some of the most commonly used. In this work, we propose integrated Fourier features, which extends these performance benefits to a very broad class of stationary covariance functions. We motivate the method and choice of parameters from a convergence analysis and empirical exploration, and show practical speedup in synthetic and real world spatial regression tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "稀疏变分逼近是扩展高斯过程推理和学习至更大数据集的流行方法。对于$N$个训练点，精确推理的成本为$O(N^3)$；使用$M \\ll N$特征的先进稀疏变分方法成本为$O(NM^2)$。最近，提出了使用更复杂特征的方法；这些方法在低维任务（如空间建模）中能够有很好的性能，但只使用了一类非常有限的核函数，排除了一些常用的核函数。在这项工作中，我们提出了综合傅里叶特征，将这些性能优势扩展到非常广泛的平稳协方差函数。我们从收敛分析和经验探索的角度来解释该方法和参数的选择，同时展示该方法在合成和实际空间回归任务中的实际加速效果。",
