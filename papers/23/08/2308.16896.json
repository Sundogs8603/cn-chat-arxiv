    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶中的语义分割正从稀疏点分割发展到密集体素分割，目标是预测所关注的三维空间中每个体素的语义占据情况。现有的基于二维投影的方法（如鸟瞰图、距离视图等）因为预测空间的密集性而无效，因为它们只能描述三维场景的子空间。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个三透视圆柱视图来有效而全面地表示点云，并提出了一个点云模型 PointOcc 来高效地处理它们。考虑到激光雷达点云的距离分布，我们利用柱坐标系构建了三透视圆柱视图，以更细粒度地对近区域进行建模。我们采用空间组池化来保留投影过程中的结构细节，并采用二维主干网路高效处理每个透视面。最后，我们通过聚合的方式获得每个点的特征。",

By constructing a cylindrical view in the cylindrical coordinate system, the point clouds are effectively modeled, and efficient processing is achieved using spatial group pooling and 2D backbones. The results show that this method can effectively predict the semantic occupancy of point clouds."
