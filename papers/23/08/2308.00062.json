    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在包括全局效应的二进制动作网络协调游戏中行动的传播。这一模型捕捉了在线社交网络中特定行动或叙述的传播的重要方面，为我们理解它们对社会结果的影响提供了基础。我们的模型自然地捕捉了起始集合之间的互补性、网络的韧性和全局效应，并突出了传播疫情的渠道之间的相互依赖关系。我们提出了新的、自然的、计算可行的算法来定义和计算方便普遍研究网络中传播疫情的平衡对象，并证明了它们的理论性质。我们的算法易于实施，有助于量化以前由于计算难以实现而难以获得的关系。使用这些算法，我们通过数百万次蒙特卡罗模拟研究了1000名玩家在无标度网络中的疫情传播。我们的分析提供了数量化的见解。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the control and spread of contagion in networks. It introduces new algorithms, defines equilibrium objects, and proves their theoretical properties. The research reveals the impact of complementarities among starting sets, network resilience, and global effects on contagion spread. Through large-scale simulations, the study provides quantitative insights into the spread of contagion in scale-free networks with 1,000 players."
