    "translated_abstract": "从电子病历（EHRs）预测住院死亡风险受到了很大的关注。这样的预测将为医疗专业人员提供患者健康状况的早期警告，以便及时采取干预措施。这个预测任务具有挑战性，因为EHR数据本质上是不规则的，不仅存在许多缺失值，而且医疗记录之间的时间间隔也不一致。现有方法主要集中于利用患者医疗记录中的变量相关性来填补缺失值，并建立时间衰减机制来处理这种不规则性。本文提出了一种新颖的基于对比学习的基于电子病历的填补预测网络，用于预测住院死亡风险。我们的方法在填补过程中引入了基于图分析的患者分层建模，以对相似患者进行分组。这使得只使用相似患者的信息，除了个人情境信息外。",
