    "translated_abstract": "生成文本到图像的模型，如稳定扩散，允许用户根据文本描述生成图像。改变提示仍然是用户想要改变生成图像的主要方式。然而，通过重新构思提示来改变图像仍然是一个困难的试错过程，这导致了提示工程作为一个新的研究领域的出现。我们提出并分析了直接改变提示嵌入的方法，而不是提示文本。它允许更精细和有针对性的控制，考虑到用户的意图。我们的方法将生成的文本到图像模型视为一个连续函数，并在图像空间和提示嵌入空间之间传递梯度。通过解决不同的用户交互问题，我们可以在三个场景中应用这个想法：（1）优化图像空间中定义的度量，可以测量图像风格等。（2）帮助用户进行创造性的图像编辑。",
