    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习模型在金融和医疗等关键领域的广泛使用，为那些受到机器学习模型决策不利影响的个体提供补救措施的需求变得更加重要；个体应该获得改善自身情况和获得有利决策的建议。之前关于顺序算法补救的工作——推荐一系列变化——主要关注行动的可行性，并使用特征变化的接近程度确定行动成本。然而，未考虑特征变化的不确定性和补救中高于平均成本的风险。如果补救措施可能（以一定概率）导致更糟糕的情况，而恢复需要付出非常高的代价，那将是不可取的。在计算和评估补救措施时，必须考虑风险。我们将考虑了这种风险因素计算出的补救措施称为更安全的算法补救（SafeAR）。",
