We prove two attendant results: the Potential Theorem, whereby a conservative monotone correspondence can be integrated up to a potential, and the Duality Theorem, whereby the potential has a Fenchel dual whose subdifferential is another conservative monotone correspondence. We use these results to reinterpret and extend Baldwin and Klemperer's (2019) characterization of demand in economies with indivisible goods. We introduce a simple test for existence of Walrasian equilibrium in quasi-linear economies. Fenchel's Duality Theorem implies this test is met when the aggregate utility is concave, which is not necessarily the case with indivisible goods even if all consumers have concave utilities.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们建立了单调对应的次梯度定理 - 如果单调对应等于一个潜力的次梯度，那么它是保守的，即使选择路径上的对应物也无关紧要，其沿闭合路径的积分消失。我们证明了两个相应的结果：潜力定理，其中一个保守的单调对应可以被积分到潜力中，以及对偶定理，其中潜力具有一个 Fenchel 对偶，其次梯度又是另一个保守的单调对应。我们利用这些结果重新解释和扩展了Baldwin和Klemperer（2019年）关于具有不可分割物品的经济需求的表征。我们引入了一个在准线性经济中存在Walras均衡的简单测试。Fenchel的对偶定理表明，当总效用是凹的时，此测试是合适的，即使所有消费者都具有凹的效用，但在具有不可分割物品的情况下不一定成立。",
