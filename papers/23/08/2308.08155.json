    "abstract": "This technical report presents AutoGen, a new framework that enables development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. AutoGen's design offers multiple advantages: a) it gracefully navigates the strong but imperfect generation and reasoning abilities of these LLMs; b) it leverages human understanding and intelligence, while providing valuable automation through conversations between agents; c) it simplifies and unifies the implementation of complex LLM workflows as automated agent chats. We provide many diverse examples of how developers can easily use AutoGen to effectively solve tasks or build applications, ranging from coding, mathematics, operations research, entertainment, online decision-making, question answering, etc.",

    "translated_abstract": "本技术报告介绍了AutoGen，一种新的框架，通过多个可以互相对话的代理来开发LLM应用程序以解决任务。AutoGen代理可以定制、可对话，并且可以无缝地允许人类参与。它们可以在各种模式下运行，利用LLM、人类输入和工具的组合。AutoGen的设计提供了多个优势：a）它能够优雅地处理这些LLM的强大但不完美的生成和推理能力；b）它利用人类的理解和智能，通过代理之间的对话提供有价值的自动化；c）它简化和统一了复杂LLM工作流程的实现，作为自动化代理对话。我们提供了许多不同的例子，展示了开发人员如何轻松使用AutoGen有效地解决任务或构建应用程序，涵盖编程、数学、运筹学、娱乐、在线决策、问答等多个领域。",
