    "translated_abstract": "基于神经网络的多任务学习在推荐系统中取得了显著的改进，并成功地应用于推荐系统。最近的深度多任务学习方法（如MMoE、PLE）专注于设计基于软门控的参数共享网络，隐式地学习每个任务的泛化表示。然而，当处理冲突任务时，多任务学习方法可能会遭受性能退化，因为负迁移效应可能发生在任务共享的底层表示上。这可能导致多任务学习方法捕捉任务特定特征的能力降低，最终影响其效果，并妨碍其在所有任务上的泛化能力。在本文中，我们专注于推荐系统中多任务学习的底层表示学习，并提出了深度任务特定的底层表示网络（DTRN）以缓解负迁移问题。DTRN通过使每个任务具有自己的表示学习明确地获取任务特定的底层表示。",
