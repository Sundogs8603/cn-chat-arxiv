    "translated_abstract": "因果发现的目标是从观测数据中找到学习因果结构的自动化搜索方法。有些情况下，感兴趣的因果机制的所有变量都已经被测量，任务是预测一个变量对另一个变量的影响。相反，有时主要关注的变量并非直接可观察，而是通过它们在数据中的表现来推理出来的。这些被称为潜在变量。一个广泛被知道的例子是心理构造的智商，因为无法直接测量，所以研究人员尝试通过各种指标如智商测试来评估。在这种情况下，因果发现算法可以揭示潜在变量之间和潜在变量与观察变量之间的因果连接，从而发现潜在的模式和结构。这篇论文主要研究因果发现中的两个问题：提供了一个弱于强可靠性的k-Triangle Faithfulness的替代定义，并提出了对统计一致性的新要求。",
