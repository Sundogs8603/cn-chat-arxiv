    "translated_abstract": "自闭症谱系障碍 (ASD) 的多因素病因表明，从神经影像学，遗传学和临床表征等广泛的平台数据中结合多模态方法可以极大地受益于对其的研究。先前的神经影像学和遗传学分析方法通常在数据驱动的工作中应用简单的特征拼接方法，或者使用一种模态的发现来指导另一种的后续分析，错失了对配对的多模态数据进行真正统一的分析的机会。在这篇论文中，我们开发了一个更综合的模型，用于结合遗传、人口统计和神经影像数据。受到基因型对表型的影响的启发，我们提出使用一种基于自注意力的方法，其中遗传数据指导对模型预测可能重要的神经影像特征的关注。遗传数据来自复制数变异参数，而神经影像数据来自功能磁共振成像。我们评估了所提出的方法。",
