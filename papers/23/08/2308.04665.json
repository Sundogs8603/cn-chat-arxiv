    "translated_abstract": "歌词生成是自然语言生成研究中一个众所周知的应用，之前的研究主要集中在使用关键词、押韵等精确控制来生成准确的歌词。然而，歌词模仿，即通过模仿源歌词的风格和内容来创作新歌词，仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务，因为缺乏平行语料库。在本文中，我们介绍了一个名为\"Sudowoodo\"的中文歌词模仿系统，它可以基于源歌词的文本生成新的歌词。为了解决歌词模仿训练过程中缺乏平行语料库的问题，我们提出了一个新颖的框架，通过基于源歌词的基于关键词的歌词模型构建平行语料库。然后使用新歌词与源歌词的对来训练歌词模仿模型。在推理过程中，我们利用后处理模块来过滤和排序生成的歌词，选择最高质量的歌词。",
