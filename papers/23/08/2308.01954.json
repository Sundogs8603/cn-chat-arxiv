    "translated_abstract": "火焰模型广泛应用于计算流体动力学中，用于模拟湍流燃烧中的热化学过程。这些模型通常使用内存密集型的查找表来表示要模拟的燃烧过程。人工神经网络（ANNs）提供了一种深度学习方法，可以使用少量的网络权重存储这些表格数据，从而可能将复杂模拟的内存需求减少数个数量级。然而，具有标准训练损失的ANN在多元回归任务中往往难以处理代表较小物种质量分数的目标值不足的情况，例如在查找表中学习少数物种质量分数。本文旨在提高ANN在学习氢（\\ce{H2}）燃烧查找表的多种物种质量分数时的准确性。我们评估了一种简单而有效的损失权重调整方法，优于标准的均方误差优化，并实现了所有物种质量分数的准确学习。",
