    "translated_abstract": "现有的关于基于人工智能的面部情绪识别（FER）的信息对于计算机科学领域以外的人来说不易理解，需要跨学科的努力来确定一个促进对这项技术及其对用户的影响的理解的分类框架。大部分支持者将FER按照方法论、实施和分析的角度进行分类，相对较少将其应用于教育领域，而没有将其用户进行分类。本文主要关注教育中FER工具的（潜在）教师用户。它提出了一个基于情感教育目标和相关理论的经典分类法，将这些教师用户分为定向、状况和偏好三类，并将文献中发现或推导出的FER解决方案类型进行整理和归类为“技术”和“应用”两类，作为构建提出的“教师用户”类别的前提。这项工作对支持者，评论者以及教育政策制定者都有着重要的意义。",
