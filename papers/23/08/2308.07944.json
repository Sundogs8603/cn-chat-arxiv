    "abstract": "Portfolio management is an essential part of investment decision-making. However, traditional methods often fail to deliver reasonable performance. This problem stems from the inability of these methods to account for the unique characteristics of multivariate time series data from stock markets. We present a two-stage method for constructing an investment portfolio of common stocks. The method involves the generation of time series representations followed by their subsequent clustering. Our approach utilizes features based on Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for the generation of representations, allowing us to elucidate the topological structure within the data. Experimental results show that our proposed system outperforms other methods. This superior performance is consistent over different time frames, suggesting the viability of TDA as a powerful tool for portfolio selection.",

    "translated_abstract": "投资组合管理是投资决策的重要部分。然而，传统方法往往不能提供合理的表现。这个问题源于这些方法无法考虑到股市多元时间序列数据的独特特征。我们提出了一个两阶段的方法来构建一个由普通股票组成的投资组合。该方法涉及时间序列表示的生成及其后续聚类。我们的方法利用基于拓扑数据分析（TDA）的特征进行表示的生成，使我们能够阐明数据中的拓扑结构。实验结果表明，我们提出的系统优于其他方法。这种优越性在不同的时间框架下都是一致的，说明TDA作为一个强大的投资组合选择工具的可行性。",
