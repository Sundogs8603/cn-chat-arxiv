    "translated_abstract": "信道建模对于设计现代无线通信系统至关重要。信道建模的复杂性和收集高质量无线信道数据的成本日益增加，已成为主要挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于扩散模型的信道抽样方法，可以快速合成有限数据的信道实现。我们使用在频率空间域中操作的基于 U Net 的扩散模型。为了评估所提模型在训练数据集中如何准确地重现信道的真实分布，我们使用了两个评估指标：$i)$ 反映天线和频率领域中归一化功率谱的实际分布和生成分布之间的近似 $2$-Wasserstein 距离，和 $ii)$ 分布的精确度和召回率度量。我们证明，与现有的基于 GAN 的方法相比，该扩散模型方法训练稳定且能够生成多样化和高质量的信道数据。",
