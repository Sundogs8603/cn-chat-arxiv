    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP). Although convenient for research and practical applications, open-source LLMs with fewer parameters often suffer from severe hallucinations compared to their larger counterparts. This paper focuses on measuring and reducing hallucinations in BLOOM 7B, a representative of such weaker open-source LLMs that are publicly available for research and commercial applications. We introduce HaloCheck, a lightweight BlackBox knowledge-free framework designed to quantify the severity of hallucinations in LLMs. Additionally, we explore techniques like knowledge injection and teacher-student approaches to alleviate hallucinations in low-parameter LLMs. Our experiments effectively demonstrate the reduction of hallucinations in challenging domains for these LLMs.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)已经彻底改变了自然语言处理(NLP)领域。虽然对于研究和实际应用来说方便，但是与其更大规模的对应模型相比，开源的参数较少的LLMs经常出现严重幻觉问题。本文着重于测量和减少BLOOM 7B中的幻觉问题，该模型是公开提供给研究和商业应用的弱开源LLMs的代表。我们引入了HaloCheck，一种轻量级的无需知识的黑盒子框架，用于量化LLMs中幻觉问题的严重程度。此外，我们探索了知识注入和师生方法等技术，以减轻低参数LLMs中的幻觉问题。我们的实验证明了在这些LLMs的挑战性领域中幻觉问题的减少。",
