    "abstract": "Graph generation poses a significant challenge as it involves predicting a complete graph with multiple nodes and edges based on simply a given label. This task also carries fundamental importance to numerous real-world applications, including de-novo drug and molecular design. In recent years, several successful methods have emerged in the field of graph generation. However, these approaches suffer from two significant shortcomings: (1) the underlying Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures used in these methods are often underexplored; and (2) these methods are often evaluated on only a limited number of metrics. To fill this gap, we investigate the expressiveness of GNNs under the context of the molecular graph generation task, by replacing the underlying GNNs of graph generative models with more expressive GNNs. Specifically, we analyse the performance of six GNNs in two different generative frameworks (GCPN and GraphAF), on six different molecular generative objectives on the ZIN",

    "translated_abstract": "图生成是一个重要的挑战，它涉及根据给定的标签预测一个完整的具有多个节点和边的图。这个任务对许多实际应用非常重要，包括药物和分子设计。近年来，在图生成领域出现了几种成功的方法。然而，这些方法存在两个重大问题：(1) 这些方法中使用的基础图神经网络（GNN）架构往往未经深入探索；(2) 这些方法往往只在有限的指标上进行评估。为填补这个空白，我们通过将图生成模型的基础GNN替换为更具表现力的GNN，研究了GNN在分子图生成任务中的表现能力。具体而言，我们分析了两种不同生成框架（GCPN和GraphAF）中六种GNN在六个不同的分子生成目标上的性能。",
