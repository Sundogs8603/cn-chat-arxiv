    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of vehicle trajectories is vital for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous vehicles. Existing methods mainly rely on generic trajectory predictions derived from large datasets, overlooking the personalized driving patterns of individual drivers. To address this gap, we propose an approach for interaction-aware personalized vehicle trajectory prediction that incorporates temporal graph neural networks. Our method utilizes Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to model the spatio-temporal interactions between target vehicles and their surrounding traffic. To personalize the predictions, we establish a pipeline that leverages transfer learning: the model is initially pre-trained on a large-scale trajectory dataset and then fine-tuned for each driver using their specific driving data. We employ human-in-the-loop simulation to collect personalized naturalistic driving trajectories and corresponding surrounding vehicle trajectories",

    "translated_abstract": "准确预测车辆轨迹对于先进驾驶辅助系统和自动驾驶汽车至关重要。现有方法主要依赖于从大型数据集中推导出的通用轨迹预测，忽视了个别驾驶员的个性化驾驶模式。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了一种交互感知的个性化车辆轨迹预测方法，该方法采用了时间图神经网络。我们的方法利用图卷积神经网络（GCN）和长短期记忆（LSTM）来建模目标车辆与周围交通之间的时空交互。为了个性化预测，我们建立了一个利用迁移学习的流程：模型首先在大规模轨迹数据集上进行预训练，然后使用特定驾驶数据针对每个驾驶员进行微调。我们采用人机协同仿真来收集个性化的自然驾驶轨迹及其相应的周围车辆轨迹。",
