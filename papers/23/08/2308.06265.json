    "abstract": "This study investigates the long-term effects of temperature variations on economic growth using a data-driven approach. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we analyze global land surface temperature data from Berkeley Earth and economic indicators, including GDP and population data, from the World Bank. Our analysis reveals a significant relationship between average temperature and GDP growth, suggesting that climate variations can substantially impact economic performance. This research underscores the importance of incorporating climate factors into economic planning and policymaking, and it demonstrates the utility of machine learning in uncovering complex relationships in climate-economy studies.",
