    "abstract": "Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is widely used in various fields, including motion analysis, healthcare, and virtual reality. However, the great expenses of labeled real-world datasets present a significant challenge for HPE. To overcome this, one approach is to train HPE models on synthetic datasets and then perform domain adaptation (DA) on real-world data. Unfortunately, existing DA methods for HPE neglect data privacy and security by using both source and target data in the adaptation process. To this end, we propose a new task, named source-free domain adaptive HPE, which aims to address the challenges of cross-domain learning of HPE without access to source data during the adaptation process. We further propose a novel framework that consists of three models: source model, intermediate model, and target model, which explores the task from both source-protect and target-relevant perspectives. The source-protect module preserves source information more effectively while resisting noise",

    "translated_abstract": "人体姿势估计广泛应用于运动分析、医疗保健和虚拟现实等领域。然而，标注实际场景的数据集的巨大开销对姿势估计构成了重要挑战。为了解决这个问题，一种方法是在合成数据集上训练姿势估计模型，然后在真实世界数据上进行域自适应(DA)。然而，现有的HPE的DA方法在适应过程中忽略了数据隐私和安全问题，因为使用了源数据和目标数据。为此，我们提出了一种新的任务，名为无源域自适应的HPE，旨在解决在适应过程中无法访问源数据的HPE的跨域学习挑战。我们进一步提出了一个由三个模型组成的新框架：源模型、中间模型和目标模型，从源数据和目标数据的角度探索该任务。源保护模块更有效地保留源信息并抵抗噪声。",
