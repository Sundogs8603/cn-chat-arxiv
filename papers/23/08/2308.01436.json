    "abstract": "While deep learning gradually penetrates operational planning, its inherent prediction errors may significantly affect electricity prices. This letter examines how prediction errors propagate into electricity prices, revealing notable pricing errors and their spatial disparity in congested power systems. To improve fairness, we propose to embed electricity market-clearing optimization as a deep learning layer. Differentiating through this layer allows for balancing between prediction and pricing errors, as oppose to minimizing prediction errors alone. This layer implicitly optimizes fairness and controls the spatial distribution of price errors across the system. We showcase the price-aware deep learning in the nexus of wind power forecasting and short-term electricity market clearing.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管深度学习逐渐渗透到运营规划中，但其固有的预测误差可能会显著影响电力价格。本文考察了预测误差如何传播到电力价格中，揭示了拥挤电力系统中显著的定价误差及其空间差异。为了提高公平性，我们提出将电力市场清算优化嵌入到深度学习层中。通过此层的区分，可以在预测误差和定价误差之间平衡，而不仅仅是最小化预测误差。该层隐式地优化公平性，并控制系统中价格误差的空间分布。我们展示了在风力发电预测和短期电力市场清算中的价格感知深度学习。",
