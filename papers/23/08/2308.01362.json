    "translated_abstract": "虽然肿瘤动力建模已被广泛应用于支持肿瘤药物的开发，但仍然需要增加预测能力，实现个性化治疗并改善决策。我们提出使用肿瘤动力神经-ODE（TDNODE）作为一种药理学信息的神经网络，以从纵向肿瘤大小数据中实现模型发现。我们展示了TDNODE在克服现有模型的一个关键限制上的能力，即能够从截断数据中进行无偏预测。编码器-解码器架构设计用于表达具有时间的广义齐次性这一基本特性的基础动力学定律。因此，建模形式使得编码器输出可以被解释为动力学速率指标，其中倒数时间作为物理单位。我们展示了生成的指标可以高准确度地用于预测患者的整体生存。所提出的建模形式为融合多模态数据提供了一个有原则的方式。",
