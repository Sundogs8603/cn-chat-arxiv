    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了公司在数据收集过程中所采用的选择架构如何影响消费者对隐私的估值，并进一步探讨了这种影响如何影响所收集数据的质量，包括数据的数量和代表性。通过运行大规模的选择实验，我们确定了消费者对其Facebook数据的估值，并针对两种常见的选择框架进行了随机化的比较：默认选择和价格锚定。相比于选择加入的情况，选择退出的默认选择会使估值降低14-22%，而将价格锚定在0-50美元会使估值降低37-53%，与将价格锚定在50-100美元相比。此外，在某些消费者群体中，对框架影响的敏感性与消费者的平均估值呈负相关。我们发现，传统的框架优化实践可以最大化收集到的数据量，但对其代表性的影响恰恰相反。当消费者的隐私估值和框架效应呈负相关时，会产生偏差加剧的效应。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study examines how choice architecture during data collection affects consumers' valuation of privacy, finding that opt-out defaults and low price anchors decrease valuations. It also discovers that in certain consumer segments, the sensitivity to frame influence is negatively correlated with privacy valuations. Furthermore, the study reveals that traditional frame optimization practices can have adverse effects on data representativeness."
