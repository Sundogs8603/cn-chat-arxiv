    "translated_abstract": "经济复杂性方法在各领域和学科中越来越受欢迎。尤其是在研究向更加绿色的经济转型等复杂且相互关联现象方面，经济复杂性工具箱显示出了巨大的潜力。利用经济复杂性方法，学者们一直在研究经济复杂性与可持续发展之间的关系，提出了识别绿色产品的特征和评估生产和技术结构对可持续发展转型的准备情况的建议。本文拟从经济复杂性的角度综述和总结与可持续发展转型研究相关的数据、方法和经验文献。我们对经济复杂性和环境可持续性研究的三个不同但相关的文献块进行综述。首先，我们调查了经济复杂性指标与环境可持续性相关指标之间的关联证据。其次，我们回顾了努力评估绿色竞争力和企业创新能力的文章。",
