    "translated_abstract": "下一个篮子推荐是基于已购篮子序列预测下一组物品的任务。这是一个被广泛研究的推荐任务，尤其是在杂货购物环境中。在下一个篮子推荐中，区分重复物品和探索物品是很有用的，即用户已经消费过的物品和用户未消费过的物品。大部分下一个篮子推荐的研究要么忽略这种区分，要么专注于重复物品。我们提出了下一个新篮子推荐的任务，即推荐仅包含新物品的篮子，这对于实际应用和下一个篮子推荐评估都很有价值。我们评估了现有下一个篮子推荐方法在下一个新篮子推荐任务上的表现，并发现在这个任务上取得的进展有限。为了解决下一个新篮子推荐任务，我们提出了一种简单的双向变换篮子推荐模型（BTBR），它专注于直接建模篮子序列中的新物品。",
