    "abstract": "Prototypical parts-based networks are becoming increasingly popular due to their faithful self-explanations. However, their similarity maps are calculated in the penultimate network layer. Therefore, the receptive field of the prototype activation region often depends on parts of the image outside this region, which can lead to misleading interpretations. We name this undesired behavior a spatial explanation misalignment and introduce an interpretability benchmark with a set of dedicated metrics for quantifying this phenomenon. In addition, we propose a method for misalignment compensation and apply it to existing state-of-the-art models. We show the expressiveness of our benchmark and the effectiveness of the proposed compensation methodology through extensive empirical studies.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于其忠实的自解释性，原型部件网络越来越受欢迎。然而，它们的相似性图计算在倒数第二层网络中。因此，原型激活区域的感受野通常依赖于图像区域外的部分，这可能导致误导性解释。我们将这种不希望的行为称为空间解释不一致，并引入了一个解释性基准，提供一套专用指标来量化这一现象。此外，我们提出了一种补偿不一致性的方法，并将其应用于现有的最先进模型。通过大量的实证研究，我们展示了我们基准的表达能力以及提出的补偿方法的有效性。",
