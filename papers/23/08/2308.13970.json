    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们提出了一个快速自适应联邦元学习（FAM）框架，用于协作学习一个单一全局模型，然后可以在个别客户端上个性化。联邦学习使多个客户端能够协作训练模型而不共享数据。参与联邦学习的客户端由于数据不足或数据多样性导致学习受到影响。然而，当数据分布发散时，学习会受到困扰。有必要学习一个可以使用客户端特定信息进行自适应的全局模型，并在客户端上创建个性化模型。MRI数据存在这个问题，第一，由于数据采集挑战，在某个地点的本地数据足以训练准确的模型，第二，由于隐私问题有数据共享限制，第三，由于客户端站点之间的领域转变，需要对学习的共享全局模型进行个性化。",
