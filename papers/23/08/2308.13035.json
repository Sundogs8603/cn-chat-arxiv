Artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to address these limitations, but the intersection of AI and VCE reveals challenges that must first be overcome. We identified five challenges to address.

    "translated_abstract": "引言：视频胶囊内镜（VCE）的技术负担和耗时的审查过程限制了其实用性。人工智能（AI）有望解决这些限制，但AI与VCE的交叉领域揭示了必须先克服的挑战。我们确定了要解决的五个挑战。挑战1：VCE数据是随机的且包含显著伪迹。挑战2：VCE解释成本高昂。挑战3：VCE数据本质上是不平衡的。挑战4：现有的VCE AIMLT计算上繁琐。挑战5：临床医生抗拒不能解释过程的AIMLT。方法：采用解剖地标检测模型，测试了卷积神经网络（CNN）在对VCE数据进行分类任务中的应用。我们还创建了一种辅助专家对VCE数据进行注释的工具。然后，我们使用不同的方法创建了更复杂的模型，包括多帧方法、基于图的CNN模型等。",
