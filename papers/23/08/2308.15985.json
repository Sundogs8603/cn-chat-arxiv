    "translated_abstract": "交通事故检测和预测是一个棘手的道路安全问题，人们已经付出了大量努力。随着视频数据的快速增长，基于视觉的交通事故检测和预测（称为Vision-TAD和Vision-TAA）成为安全驾驶和监控安全的最后一英里问题。然而，交通事故的长尾、不平衡、高动态、复杂和不确定属性形成了Vision-TAD和Vision-TAA的分布外特征。当前的人工智能发展可能会关注这些分布外但重要的问题。为了解决这个问题，综述至关重要。我们在深度学习时代提出了第一篇关于Vision-TAD的综述，也是第一篇关于Vision-TAA的综述。在调查过程中，我们详细讨论了每个研究原型的优缺点。此外，我们还对31个公开可用的原型进行了批判性评论。",
