    "translated_abstract": "理解数字文档就像解决一个谜题，尤其是历史文档。文档版面分析(DLA)通过将文档划分为段落、图片和表格等部分，帮助解决这个谜题。这对于机器来阅读和理解这些文档非常重要。在DL Sprint 2.0竞赛中，我们致力于理解孟加拉文档。我们使用了一个名为BaDLAD的数据集，其中包含很多例子。我们训练了一个特殊的模型，称为Mask R-CNN，来帮助理解。通过逐步的超参数调整，我们改进了这个模型，并取得了0.889的好的dice分数。然而，并不是一切都进行得非常完美。我们尝试使用训练好的英文文档模型，但它与孟加拉文不太匹配。这向我们展示了每种语言都有自己的挑战。我们对DL Sprint 2.0的解决方案可以在https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dlsprint2/discussion/432201公开获得，其中包括notebooks、权重和推理笔记本。",
