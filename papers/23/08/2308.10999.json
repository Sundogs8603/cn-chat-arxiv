    "abstract": "Our previous experiments demonstrated that subsets collections of (short) documents (with several hundred entries) share a common normalized in some way eigenvalue spectrum of combinatorial Laplacian. Based on this insight, we propose a method of incremental spectral clustering. The method consists of the following steps: (1) split the data into manageable subsets, (2) cluster each of the subsets, (3) merge clusters from different subsets based on the eigenvalue spectrum similarity to form clusters of the entire set. This method can be especially useful for clustering methods of complexity strongly increasing with the size of the data sample,like in case of typical spectral clustering. Experiments were performed showing that in fact the clustering and merging the subsets yields clusters close to clustering the entire dataset.",
