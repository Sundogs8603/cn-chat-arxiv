    "translated_abstract": "知识库问答（KBQA）是一个关键且具有挑战性的任务，因为知识库中的实体数量庞大，并且用户提出的自然语言问题多样化。不幸的是，大多数KBQA模型在现实场景中性能显著下降，因为高质量的注释数据不足。为了减轻手动注释的负担，我们利用大型语言模型（LLMs）作为程序翻译器，介绍了FlexKBQA来解决少样本KBQA任务中固有的挑战。具体而言，FlexKBQA利用自动化算法从知识库中抽样多样的程序（如SPARQL查询），然后通过LLMs将其转换为自然语言问题。这个合成的数据集有助于训练一个专门的轻量级模型来处理知识库。此外，为了减少合成数据与真实用户问题之间的分布偏移的障碍，FlexKBQA引入了一个执行机制。",
