    "translated_abstract": "负采样对于基于隐式反馈的协同过滤是必不可少的，它用于从大量未标记数据中构建负信号，以指导监督学习。现有方法的最新想法是利用携带更多有用信息的困难负样本来构建更好的决策边界。为了平衡效率和效果，绝大多数现有方法采用两遍方法，其中第一遍采样固定数量的未观察项，采用简单静态分布，然后第二遍使用更复杂的负采样策略选择最终的负项。然而，从原始项中选择负样本固有的限制，可能无法很好地与正样本形成对比。在本文中，我们通过实验证实了这一观察，并介绍了现有解决方案的两个限制：模糊陷阱和信息歧视。我们对这些限制的回应是引入增强的负采样方法，它能够更好地应对这些限制。",
