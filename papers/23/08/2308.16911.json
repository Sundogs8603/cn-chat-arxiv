    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）的前所未有的进展对自然语言处理产生了深远影响，但在3D理解领域仍有待完全发展。本文介绍了PointLLM，这是一项填补这一空白的初步工作，使LLM能够理解点云，并提供了超越2D视觉数据的新途径。PointLLM通过人类指导处理带有颜色的物体点云，并生成环境上恰当的响应，展示了其对点云和常识的掌握。具体来说，它利用了一个点云编码器和一个强大的LLM，有效地融合了几何、外观和语言信息。我们收集了一个新颖的数据集，包括66万个简单和7万个复杂的点-文本指令对，以实现两阶段的训练策略：首先对齐潜在空间，然后对统一模型进行指令调整。为了严格评估我们模型的感知能力和其泛化能力，我们建立了评估基准数据集进行实验。",
