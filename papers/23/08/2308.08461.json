    "translated_abstract": "在推荐系统中，用户行为数据往往是观察性的而不是实验性的，导致数据中普遍存在偏差。因此，解决偏差问题已成为推荐系统领域的一个重要挑战。最近，双重稳健学习（DR）由于其卓越的性能和稳健的特性而受到了广泛关注。然而，我们的实验结果表明，现有的DR方法在存在所谓的有毒插补（Poisonous Imputation）时受到严重影响，插补明显偏离真实数据并适得其反。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种保守双重稳健策略（CDR），通过审查插补的均值和方差来过滤插补。理论分析表明，CDR可以降低方差并改进尾部界限。此外，我们的实验研究表明，CDR显著提升了性能，并且确实减少了有毒插补的频率。",
