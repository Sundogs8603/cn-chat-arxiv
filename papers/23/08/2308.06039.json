    "abstract": "In learning to defer, a predictor identifies risky decisions and defers them to a human expert. One key issue with this setup is that the expert may end up over-relying on the machine's decisions, due to anchoring bias. At the same time, whenever the machine chooses the deferral option the expert has to take decisions entirely unassisted. As a remedy, we propose learning to guide (LTG), an alternative framework in which -- rather than suggesting ready-made decisions -- the machine provides guidance useful to guide decision-making, and the human is entirely responsible for coming up with a decision. We also introduce SLOG, an LTG implementation that leverages (a small amount of) human supervision to convert a generic large language model into a module capable of generating textual guidance, and present preliminary but promising results on a medical diagnosis task.",

    "translated_abstract": "在学习推迟的过程中，一个预测器识别出风险决策并将它们推迟给人类专家。这种设置的一个关键问题是，由于锚定偏见，专家可能会过分依赖于机器的决策。同时，每当机器选择推迟选项时，专家必须完全自主地做出决策。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了学习引导（LTG）的另一种框架，在这个框架中，机器不是提供现成的决策，而是提供有助于指导决策的指导，并且人类完全负责做出决策。我们还介绍了SLOG，这是一个LTG实现，利用（少量）人类监督将通用大型语言模型转化为能够生成文本指导的模块，并在医学诊断任务上展示了初步但有希望的结果。",
