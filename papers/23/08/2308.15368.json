    "translated_abstract": "智能机器人被设计为能够有效地在充满移动机械元素和物体的动态和不可预测的环境中导航。这种环境诱发的动态，包括移动的障碍物，可以在运行时改变计算需求（例如，创建新任务）和工作负载的结构（例如任务之间的优先约束），从而对系统整体性能产生不利影响。当多任务推理预期在资源和实时约束条件严格的机器人上进行时，这种挑战会被放大。为了解决这种挑战，我们引入了一种名为RED的系统性实时调度方法，旨在支持资源有限的机器人系统中的多任务深度神经网络工作负载。它被设计为在遵守实时约束的同时适应性地管理机器人环境动态（RED）。RED的核心是一个基于截止时间的调度程序，它采用中间截止时间分配策略，从而有效地管理任务的执行顺序。",
