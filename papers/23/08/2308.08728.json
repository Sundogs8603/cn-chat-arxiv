    "abstract": "As a vital stage of automated rule checking (ARC), rule interpretation of regulatory texts requires considerable effort. However, interpreting regulatory clauses with implicit properties or complex computational logic is still challenging due to the lack of domain knowledge and limited expressibility of conventional logic representations. Thus, LLM-FuncMapper, an approach to identifying predefined functions needed to interpret various regulatory clauses based on the large language model (LLM), is proposed. First, by systematically analysis of building codes, a series of atomic functions are defined to capture shared computational logics of implicit properties and complex constraints, creating a database of common blocks for interpreting regulatory clauses. Then, a prompt template with the chain of thought is developed and further enhanced with a classification-based tuning strategy, to enable common LLMs for effective function identification. Finally, the proposed approach is validated",

    "translated_abstract": "作为自动化规则检查（ARC）的关键阶段，对监管性文本的规则解释需要相当大的努力。然而，由于缺乏领域知识和传统逻辑表示的表达能力有限，解释具有隐式属性或复杂计算逻辑的监管条款仍然具有挑战性。因此，提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的识别各种监管条款所需的预定义函数的方法LLM-FuncMapper。首先，通过对建筑法规进行系统分析，定义了一系列原子函数，以捕捉隐式属性和复杂约束的共享计算逻辑，创建了常见块的数据库，用于解释监管条款。然后，开发了一个具有思维链的提示模板，并通过基于分类的调优策略进一步增强，以实现有效的函数识别功能。最后，验证了所提出的方法。",
