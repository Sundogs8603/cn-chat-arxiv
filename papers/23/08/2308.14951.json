    "abstract": "Most state-of-the-art spoken language identification models are closed-set; in other words, they can only output a language label from the set of classes they were trained on. Open-set spoken language identification systems, however, gain the ability to detect when an input exhibits none of the original languages. In this paper, we implement a novel approach to open-set spoken language identification that uses MFCC and pitch features, a TDNN model to extract meaningful feature embeddings, confidence thresholding on softmax outputs, and LDA and pLDA for learning to classify new unknown languages. We present a spoken language identification system that achieves 91.76% accuracy on trained languages and has the capability to adapt to unknown languages on the fly. To that end, we also built the CU MultiLang Dataset, a large and diverse multilingual speech corpus which was used to train and evaluate our system.",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数最先进的言语识别模型是闭集的，即它们只能输出它们在训练时使用的类别集合中的语言标签。然而，开放集言语识别系统具备检测输入是否不属于原始语言的能力。本文实现了一种新颖的开放集言语识别方法，该方法使用MFCC和音高特征， TDNN模型提取有意义的特征嵌入，通过对softmax输出进行置信度阈值处理，以及使用LDA和pLDA学习对新的未知语言进行分类。我们提出了一个言语识别系统，其在经过训练的语言上实现了91.76%的准确率，并具备实时适应未知语言的能力。为此，我们还构建了CU MultiLang数据集，这是一个大规模多样化的多语言语音语料库，用于训练和评估我们的系统。",
