Specifically, we benchmark several popular off-the-shelf LLMs, such as ChatGPT, LLaMA, ChatGLM, on five recommendation tasks, including rating prediction, sequential recommendation, direct recommendation, explanation generation, and review summarization.

The benchmark results indicate that LLMs displayed only moderate proficiency in accuracy-based tasks such as sequential and direct recommendation.

    "translated_abstract": "近期，像ChatGPT这样的大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展通过增强对话模型的能力，显著提升了自然语言处理任务。然而，LLMs在推荐领域的应用尚未得到深入研究。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了LLMRec，这是一个基于LLMs的推荐系统，旨在对多种推荐任务进行LLMs的基准测试。具体而言，我们对几种热门的现成LLMs进行了基准测试，包括ChatGPT、LLaMA和ChatGLM，涵盖了评分预测、顺序推荐、直接推荐、解释生成和评论摘要等五个推荐任务。此外，我们研究了有监督微调的有效性，以提高LLMs的指令遵循能力。基准测试结果表明，LLMs在基于准确性的任务（如顺序推荐和直接推荐）上只表现出中等的熟练程度。然而，它们在性能上与最先进的方法控制能力相当。",
