    "translated_title": "为什么我们尚未拥有AGI",
    "translated_abstract": "2002年重新阐述了AI的原始愿景，称之为“人工通用智能”或AGI。这一愿景是构建能够像人类一样学习、推理和解决问题的“思考机器”计算机系统。这与几十年来几乎所有人在该领域实践的“狭义AI”方法形成鲜明对比。虽然有几个大规模的项目名义上在致力于AGI的研发（尤其是DeepMind），但在纯粹专注的AGI发展领域，资金和推广并不充足。这令人惊讶，因为真正的AGI可以为人类带来巨大的价值。除了在这个领域缺乏努力之外，还存在亏欠的理论和方法上的错误。我们强调纯粹的统计方法无法实现AGI，并确定了实现类似人类适应能力和自主学习的关键认知能力。最终，我们概述了社会技术发展方面的一些问题。",
