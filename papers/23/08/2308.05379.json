    "translated_abstract": "相关建模旨在定位与对应查询相关的理想项目，这对于搜索引擎确保用户体验非常重要。虽然大多数传统方法通过评估查询与项目之间的语义相似性来解决这个问题，但纯语义匹配并不是唯一的方法。实际上，从用户搜索记录的历史行为数据中提取的辅助查询-项目交互可以提供进一步揭示用户搜索意图的线索。得益于此，我们设计了一种新颖的基于行为增强相关学习模型的支付宝搜索模型（BARL-ASe），该模型利用目标项目的相邻查询和目标查询的相邻项目来补充目标查询-项目的语义匹配。具体而言，我们的模型建立了多层共同注意力，从相邻和目标视图中提取了粗粒度和细粒度的语义表示。模型随后采用邻居-目标的自我监督学习来提高精度和鲁棒性。",
