    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型(LLMs)在理解自然语言和生成编程代码方面显示出了非凡能力。当遇到编码问题时，软件工程师常常会咨询LLMs。尽管已经做出了一些努力来避免语法错误并使代码与预期的语义对齐，但LLMs生成的代码的可靠性和鲁棒性尚未被深入研究。在真实的软件开发环境中，可执行的代码并不等同于可靠和鲁棒的代码。在生成的代码中滥用API可能会导致严重的问题，如资源泄漏、程序崩溃。更糟糕的是，LLM代码生成服务的用户实际上是最容易受到这些看似正确的代码影响的开发者——他们通常是不熟悉LLMs为他们生成代码的API的初级开发者。因此，他们很难察觉到API的滥用。",
    "tldr": "本研究针对大型语言模型生成的代码的可靠性和鲁棒性进行了研究，发现在真实的软件开发中可执行的代码并不能保证可靠和鲁棒，滥用API可能导致严重问题。这对初级开发者来说尤其危险，因为他们很难察觉到代码中的API滥用问题。"
