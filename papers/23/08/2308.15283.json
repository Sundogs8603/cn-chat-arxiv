    "translated_abstract": "图同态计数是1967年由Lov\\'asz首次探索的，最近在基于图的机器学习中引起了人们的兴趣。Grohe (PODS 2020)提出了在机器学习的图级别和节点级别任务中使用同态计数的理论基础。由于其本质上捕捉了局部结构信息，这使得创建稳健的结构嵌入成为可能。虽然Nguyen和Maehara (ICML 2020)已经提出了用于图级任务的第一种方法，但我们通过实验证明了基于同态计数的节点嵌入的有效性。这些嵌入与节点标签、节点权重和边权重相结合，提供了对图数据的可解释性表示，增强了机器学习模型的可解释性。我们提出了一个理论框架，用于同构不变的基于同态计数的嵌入，适用于各种下游任务。我们的方法充分利用了高效计算的特点。",
