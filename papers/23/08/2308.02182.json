    "translated_abstract": "在实验环境中，深度学习（DL）已成功应用于加密网络流量分类。然而，在实际应用中，DL分类器的性能随时间不可避免地下降。仅仅对新数据集进行模型重新训练只能部分提高其性能。手动调整模型架构以满足新数据集上的性能期望耗时且需要领域专业知识。本文提出了一种新颖的工具AutoML4ETC，用于自动设计高效且高性能的神经架构以进行加密流量分类。我们定义了一个新颖而强大的搜索空间，专门针对使用数据包头字节进行近实时加密流量分类。通过在搜索空间上使用不同的搜索策略，我们展示了AutoML4ETC生成的神经架构在多个数据集上均优于当前最先进的加密流量分类器，包括公共基准数据集。",
