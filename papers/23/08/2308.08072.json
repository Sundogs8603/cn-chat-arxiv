    "translated_abstract": "在不违反用户隐私的情况下构建基于图神经网络（GNN）的推荐系统是具有挑战性的。现有方法可以分为联邦GNN和去中心化GNN两种。然而，这两种方法都存在问题，如通信效率低和隐私泄露。本文提出了一种新的去中心化GNN框架，名为DGREC，用于隐私保护推荐，用户可以选择公开他们的交互。该框架包括三个阶段，即图构建、局部梯度计算和全局梯度传递。第一阶段为每个用户构建了一个本地内部物品超图和一个全局用户间图。第二阶段对用户偏好进行建模，并在每个本地设备上计算梯度。第三阶段设计了一种名为安全梯度共享的本地差分隐私机制，以保护用户的私密数据。我们在三个公共数据集上进行了大量实验，验证了我们框架的一贯优越性。",
