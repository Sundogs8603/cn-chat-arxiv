    "abstract": "Learning meaningful representations is at the heart of many tasks in the field of modern machine learning. Recently, a lot of methods were introduced that allow learning of image representations without supervision. These representations can then be used in downstream tasks like classification or object detection. The quality of these representations is close to supervised learning, while no labeled images are needed. This survey paper provides a comprehensive review of these methods in a unified notation, points out similarities and differences of these methods, and proposes a taxonomy which sets these methods in relation to each other. Furthermore, our survey summarizes the most-recent experimental results reported in the literature in form of a meta-study. Our survey is intended as a starting point for researchers and practitioners who want to dive into the field of representation learning.",

    "translated_abstract": "在现代机器学习领域中，学习有意义的表示是许多任务的核心。最近引入了许多允许无监督学习图像表示的方法。这些表示可以应用于分类或物体检测等下游任务中。这些表示的质量接近于有监督学习，而不需要标记的图像。本综述论文以统一的符号表示对这些方法进行了全面的回顾，指出了这些方法的相似性和差异，并提出了一种分类法，将这些方法联系起来。此外，我们的综述通过元分析总结了文献中最新的实验结果。我们的综述旨在为希望深入研究表示学习领域的研究人员和实践者提供一个起点。",
