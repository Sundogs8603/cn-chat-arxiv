    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习（SSL）通过允许从大量未标记数据中学习，已经在计算机视觉领域取得了重要突破。因此，在需要高度专门化专业知识来注释数据的生物医学领域中，SSL可能发挥关键作用。然而，在许多医疗领域中，SSL的应用尚未广泛探索，其中之一就是内窥镜检查，这种微创手术常用于检测和治疗感染、慢性炎症性疾病或癌症。本研究中，我们研究了一种领先的SSL框架，即Masked Siamese Networks（MSNs），用于内窥镜视频分析，例如结肠镜检查和腹腔镜检查。为了充分利用SSL的能力，我们创建了大规模的未标记内窥镜视频数据集来训练MSN。这些强大的图像表示作为有限标记数据集的二次训练的基础，使得在内窥镜基准测试中获得了最先进的性能，如手术阶段识别等。",
