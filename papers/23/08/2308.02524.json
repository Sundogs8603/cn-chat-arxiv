In the agriculture sector, the existing smart agriculture systems just use data from sensing and internet of things (IoT) technologies that exclude crop cultivation knowledge to support decision-making by farmers. To enhance this, the chatbot application can be an assistant to farmers to provide crop cultivation knowledge. Consequently, we propose the LINE chatbot application as an information and knowledge representation providing crop cultivation recommendations to farmers. It works with smart agriculture and recommendation systems. Our proposed LINE chatbot application consists of five main functions (start/stop menu, main page, drip irri gation page, mist irrigation page, and monitor page). Farmers will receive information for data monitoring to support their decision-making. Moreover, they can control the irrigation system via the LINE chatbot. Furthermore, farmer",

    "translated_abstract": "聊天机器人是一种能够自动快速地回复文本或语音对话的软件。在农业领域中，现有的智能农业系统仅使用来自感应和物联网技术的数据，不包括作物种植知识来支持农民的决策。为了增强这一点，聊天机器人应用可以成为农民的助手，提供作物种植知识。因此，我们提出了 LINE 聊天机器人应用作为信息和知识表示，为农民提供作物种植建议。它与智能农业和推荐系统配合使用。我们提出的 LINE 聊天机器人应用包括五个主要的功能（开始/停止菜单、主页、滴灌页面、雾灌页面和监控页面）。农民们将会获得用于数据监控以支持决策的信息。此外，他们可以通过 LINE 聊天机器人来控制灌溉系统。",
