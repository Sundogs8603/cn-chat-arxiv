Based on insights from the Delors report on education [1], we first address the role of education and recall the main objectives that educational institutes must strive to achieve independently of any technology. We then explore the strengths and limitations of AI, based on current advances in AI. We explain how courses and exams can be designed based on these strengths and limitations of AI, providing different examples in the IT, English, and Art domains. We show how we adopted a pedagogical approach that is inspired from the Socratic teaching method from January 2023 to May 2023. Then, we present the data analysis results of seven ChatGPT-authorized exams conducted between December 2022 and March 2023. Our exam data results show that there is no correlation between stud",

    "translated_abstract": "在本篇观点论文中，我们主张在人工智能时代，课程和考试的设计必须基于两个因素：（1）人工智能的优势和局限性，（2）教育学教育目标。基于对Delors教育报告的洞察[1]，我们首先讨论了教育的作用，并回顾了教育机构在任何技术下都必须努力实现的主要目标。然后，我们基于当前人工智能的进展探讨了人工智能的优势和局限性。我们解释了如何根据这些优势和局限性设计课程和考试，并提供了IT、英语和艺术领域的不同示例。我们展示了我们从2023年1月到2023年5月采用了受苏格拉底教学法启发的教学方法。然后，我们呈现了2022年12月至2023年3月举行的七场ChatGPT授权考试的数据分析结果。我们的考试数据结果表明，学生的学习成绩与考试中的ChatGPT 不具有相关性。",
