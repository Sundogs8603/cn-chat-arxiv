    "translated_abstract": "自动合成模拟和射频（RF）电路是一种流行的方法，需要一种高效的电路建模方法。这是因为在每个合成周期中运行大量仿真的成本昂贵。人工智能方法是电路建模的有希望的方法，因为它们速度快且相对准确。然而，现有方法需要大量训练数据，这些数据仍然使用模拟运行收集。此外，即使添加或删除一个单一元素，这些方法也需要为每个电路拓扑收集一个完整的单独数据集。这些问题在需要进行后布局建模仿真时尤为严重，而这需要更长的时间。为了解决这些问题，在本文中我们提出了FuNToM，一种用于RF电路的功能建模方法。FuNToM利用了双端口分析方法，使用一个主数据集和多个小数据集来建模多个拓扑。它还利用了神经网络。",
