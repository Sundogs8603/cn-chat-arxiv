    "translated_abstract": "变分流允许从事者学习复杂的连续分布，但是近似离散分布仍然是一个挑战。目前的方法通常将离散目标嵌入连续空间中-通常是通过连续松弛或去量化-然后应用连续流动。这些方法涉及一个可能无法捕捉到原始离散目标的替代目标，可能具有偏倚或不稳定的梯度，并且可能会创建一个困难的优化问题。在这项工作中，我们开发了一种针对离散分布的变分流族，而不需要任何连续嵌入。首先，我们开发了一个保持度量的离散可逆映射，使离散目标保持不变，然后基于该映射创建了一个混合变分流(MAD Mix)。我们还开发了一个扩展，用于处理联合离散和连续模型。我们的实验表明，MAD Mix产生了比连续嵌入流更可靠的近似。",
