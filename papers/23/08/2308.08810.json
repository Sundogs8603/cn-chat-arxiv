    "translated_abstract": "测试时适应性 (TTA)旨在在推理过程中以批次为单位将预训练模型适应到目标领域。尽管实际情况中标签分布往往存在不平衡现象，但大多数现有的TTA方法通常假设源领域和目标领域的数据集都具有平衡的标签分布。由于某些类别在某些领域中出现更频繁（如城市中的建筑物，森林中的树木），标签分布在领域发生变化时会自然地发生变化。然而，我们发现大多数现有的TTA方法没有很好地解决协变量和标签偏移共存的问题。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种新的标签偏移适配器，它可以与现有的TTA方法结合使用，有效处理TTA过程中的标签偏移。具体而言，我们估计目标领域的标签分布，将其输入到标签偏移适配器中。随后，标签偏移适配器产生最优解。",
