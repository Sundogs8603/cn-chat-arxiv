    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种投资组合优化框架，其中利用粗路径签名（Lyons, 1998）的使用提供了一种新颖的方法来在联合信号-资产动力学中纳入路径依赖性，从而自然地扩展了传统因子模型，同时保持了生成的公式轻量级且易于解释。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种基于路径依赖性和外生信号的投资组合优化框架，通过利用粗路径签名将交易策略表示为路径的线性函数，将过去的时间序列观测的演化编码到优化问题中，并提出了动态均值-方差准则的简洁公式和显式解决方案，以及在有限时间范围内自然地引入了回撤控制的最优策略。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a portfolio optimization framework that incorporates path-dependencies and exogenous signals by utilizing rough path signatures. It introduces the concept of \"Signature Trading\" where a trading strategy is represented as a linear functional applied to the signature of a path, allowing efficient encoding of past time-series observations. The paper also provides a concise formulation and explicit solution for the dynamic mean-variance criterion, as well as incorporating drawdown control in the optimal strategy over a finite time horizon."
