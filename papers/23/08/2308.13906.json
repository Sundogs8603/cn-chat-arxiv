    "translated_abstract": "随着无人机在人类生活中越来越普及，它们也带来了安全担忧，包括未经授权的访问和控制，以及与有人飞机的碰撞和干扰。因此，确保能够准确地检测和识别不同的无人机对于覆盖延伸具有重要意义。在机器学习的帮助下，射频（RF）检测可以根据采样的无人机信号识别无人机的类型和飞行模式。本文首先利用短时傅里叶变换（STFT）从原始信号中提取包含时域和频域信息的二维特征。然后，我们使用采用ResNet结构构建的卷积神经网络（CNN）实现多类别分类。我们的实验结果表明，所提出的ResNet-STFT在扩展数据集上具有更高的准确性和更快的收敛速度。此外，与其他基线模型相比，它表现出良好的平衡性能。",
