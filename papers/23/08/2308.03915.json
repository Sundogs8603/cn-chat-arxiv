    "abstract": "Nonlinear materials are often difficult to model with classical state model theory because they have a complex and sometimes inaccurate physical and mathematical description or we simply do not know how to describe such materials in terms of relations between external and internal variables. In many disciplines, Neural Network methods have arisen as powerful tools to identify very complex and non-linear correlations. In this work, we use the very recently developed concept of Physically Guided Neural Networks with Internal Variables (PGNNIV) to discover constitutive laws using a model-free approach and training solely with measured force-displacement data. PGNNIVs make a particular use of the physics of the problem to enforce constraints on specific hidden layers and are able to make predictions without internal variable data. We demonstrate that PGNNIVs are capable of predicting both internal and external variables under unseen load scenarios, regardless of the nature of the material ",

    "translated_abstract": "常常很难用经典的状态模型来建模非线性材料的原因是它们具有复杂且不准确的物理和数学描述，或者我们根本不知道如何从外部和内部变量之间的关系来描述这些材料。在许多学科中，神经网络方法已经成为识别非常复杂和非线性相关性的强大工具。在这项工作中，我们使用最新开发的具有内部变量的物理引导神经网络（PGNNIV）的概念，以无模型的方法和仅使用测量的力-位移数据进行训练来发现本构定律。PGNNIV通过将问题的物理特性应用于特定的隐藏层来强制执行约束条件，并能够在不使用内部变量数据的情况下进行预测。我们证明，PGNNIV能够在未见过的加载场景下预测内部和外部变量，无论材料的性质如何。",
