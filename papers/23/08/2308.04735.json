    "translated_abstract": "物理信息神经网络被广泛应用于偏微分方程，并取得了巨大的成功，因为物理信息损失基本上不需要观测或离散化。然而，优化模型参数很困难，并且这些参数必须针对每个不同的初始条件进行训练。为了克服这些挑战，在二阶反应-扩散类型方程中，一种可能的方法是使用五点卷积神经网络（FCNNs）。FCNNs使用两个连续的快照进行训练，其中时间步长对应于给定快照的步长。因此，FCNNs的时间演化取决于时间步长，并且时间步长必须满足其CFL条件，以避免爆炸解。在这项工作中，我们提出具有较大感受野的深层FCNNs，以预测具有大于CFL条件阈值的时间演化。为了评估我们的模型，我们考虑了热量、费舍尔和Allen-Cahn方程。",
