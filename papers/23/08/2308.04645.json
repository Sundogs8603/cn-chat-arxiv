    "translated_abstract": "短语结构分析在推动自然语言处理（NLP）任务中起着基础性的作用。然而，仅依靠标注的解析数据训练古代语言的自动句法分析系统是一项艰巨的任务，因为构建这些语言的树库存在固有挑战。这需要丰富的语言专业知识，导致可用资源的稀缺。为了克服这个障碍，跨语言转移技术为低资源目标语言提供了一种有希望的解决方案，这些技术需要最少甚至没有标注数据。在本研究中，我们着重于构建适用于中古高地德语（MHG）的短语结构分析器，在缺乏标注的MHG树库进行训练的现实条件下。在我们的方法中，我们利用MHG和现代德语（MG）之间的语言连续性和结构相似性，以及丰富的MG树库资源。",
