    "translated_abstract": "3D地下雷达（3D-GPR）在路基损坏检测中的应用已经广泛流行起来。为了提高检测的效率和准确性，先导性研究尝试采用自动检测技术，特别是深度学习。然而，现有的工作通常依赖于传统的1D A扫描、2D B扫描或3D C扫描数据，导致空间信息不足或计算复杂度高。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了一种新的方法来处理3D-GPR数据的路基损坏检测任务，利用多视角信息。此外，我们还构建了一个由原始3D-GPR数据导出的真实多视角图像数据集，用于检测任务，相比A扫描和B扫描数据，该数据集提供了更丰富的空间信息，同时降低了与C扫描数据相比的计算复杂性。随后，我们开发了一种新的多视角融合和蒸馏框架",
