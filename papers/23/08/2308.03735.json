    "abstract": "Personalized recommendations form an important part of today's internet ecosystem, helping artists and creators to reach interested users, and helping users to discover new and engaging content. However, many users today are skeptical of platforms that personalize recommendations, in part due to historically careless treatment of personal data and data privacy. Now, businesses that rely on personalized recommendations are entering a new paradigm, where many of their systems must be overhauled to be privacy-first. In this article, we propose an algorithm for personalized recommendations that facilitates both precise and differentially-private measurement. We consider advertising as an example application, and conduct offline experiments to quantify how the proposed privacy-preserving algorithm affects key metrics related to user experience, advertiser value, and platform revenue compared to the extremes of both (private) non-personalized and non-private, personalized implementations.",

    "translated_abstract": "个性化推荐是当今互联网生态系统的重要组成部分，它帮助艺术家和创作者吸引感兴趣的用户，同时也帮助用户发现新的有趣内容。然而，由于个人数据和数据隐私的历史上粗心对待，许多用户对个性化推荐平台持怀疑态度。现在，依赖于个性化推荐的企业正进入一个新的范例，需要对他们的系统进行改进，以保护隐私。本文提出了一种个性化推荐算法，既可以实现精确测量，又可以保护差分隐私。我们以广告为例应用，并进行离线实验，量化提出的隐私保护算法对用户体验、广告商价值和平台收入等关键指标的影响，与（私密的）非个性化和非私密的个性化实现的极端情况进行对比。",
