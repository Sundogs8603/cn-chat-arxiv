    "translated_abstract": "对话关系抽取(DRE)是识别对话文本中参数对之间关系的任务，但常见的问题是人称代词、实体和发言者的核指代。本文引入了一个新的基准数据集DialogRE^C+，将核指代解决方案引入到DRE场景中。通过高质量的核指代知识，期望增强参数关系的推理能力。在DialogRE^C+数据集中，我们根据现有的DialogRE数据手动注释了总共5,068个核指代链，涵盖了36,369个参数提及。其中，明确标记了四种不同的核指代链类型，分别是发言者链、个人链、地点链和组织链。我们还开发了4个基于图的DRE模型，以学习有效的核指代表示，从而改进DRE任务。我们还基于我们的注释训练了一个核指代解决模型，并评估了自动提取的核指代对任务的影响。",
