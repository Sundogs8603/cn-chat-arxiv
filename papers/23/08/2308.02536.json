    "abstract": "Compiling a quantum circuit for specific quantum hardware is a challenging task. Moreover, current quantum computers have severe hardware limitations. To make the most use of the limited resources, the compilation process should be optimized. To improve currents methods, Reinforcement Learning (RL), a technique in which an agent interacts with an environment to learn complex policies to attain a specific goal, can be used. In this work, we present qgym, a software framework derived from the OpenAI gym, together with environments that are specifically tailored towards quantum compilation. The goal of qgym is to connect the research fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with quantum compilation by abstracting parts of the process that are irrelevant to either domain. It can be used to train and benchmark RL agents and algorithms in highly customizable environments.",

    "translated_abstract": "将量子电路编译为特定的量子硬件是一项具有挑战性的任务。此外，当前的量子计算机存在严重的硬件限制。为了发挥有限资源的最大作用，编译过程应进行优化。为了改进当前的方法，可以使用强化学习（RL），这是一种技术，其中代理与环境交互以学习复杂策略以达到特定目标。在这项工作中，我们提出了qgym，这是一个从OpenAI gym派生的软件框架，以及专门针对量子编译的环境。qgym的目标是通过抽象对于两个领域都无关的过程的部分，将人工智能（AI）的研究领域与量子编译相连接。它可以用于在高度可定制的环境中训练和基准测试RL代理和算法。",
