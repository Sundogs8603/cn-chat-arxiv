    "translated_abstract": "在许多机器学习和统计应用中，最大均值差异(MMD)因其处理非欧几里得数据的能力而获得了很多成功，包括非参数假设检验。最近，Balasubramanian等人(2021)通过实验证明，基于MMD的拟合优度检验在适当选择正则化参数时，并不是最小化最大风险，而其Tikhonov正则化版本则是最小化最大风险的。然而，Balasubramanian等人(2021)的结果是在均值元素为零的限制性假设和积分操作符特征函数的均匀有界性条件下获得的。此外，Balasubramanian等人(2021)提出的检验在许多核函数中是不可计算的，因此不实用。本文解决了这些问题，并将结果推广到包括Tikhonov正则化在内的一般谱正则化方法中。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了具有谱正则化的核拟合优度检验方法，用于处理非欧几里得数据。相比之前的方法，本方法在选择适当的正则化参数时能达到最小化最大风险。同时，本方法还克服了之前方法对均值元素为零和积分操作符特征函数均匀有界性条件的限制，并且能够计算更多种类的核函数。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a spectral regularized kernel goodness-of-fit test method for handling non-Euclidean data. Compared to previous methods, this method achieves minimax optimality when selecting an appropriate regularization parameter. Additionally, it overcomes the limitations of previous methods regarding the mean element being zero and the uniform boundedness condition on the eigenfunctions of the integral operator, and can compute a wider range of kernel functions."
