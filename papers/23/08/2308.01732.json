    "translated_abstract": "本文回顾性地概述了我们部门近十年来关于自组织个人知识助手在不断演化的公司记忆中的研究。我们的研究通常受到现实世界问题的启发，并常常与研究和工业合作伙伴进行跨学科合作。我们总结了过去的实验和结果，包括企业和个人环境中各种知识图构建的方式，Managed Forgetting和(Self-organizing) Context Spaces作为个人信息管理(PIM)和知识工作支持的新方法。过去的结果结合了相关工作的概述和我们迄今未发表的一些最新发现。最后，我们概述了我们相关的工业使用案例，包括对CoMem的详细介绍，它是基于我们提出的研究的公司记忆，已经投入使用并为进一步的研究提供了挑战。许多贡献仅仅是新发展的第一步。",
