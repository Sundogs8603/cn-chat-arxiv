    "translated_abstract": "城市之间的高速公路交通对于城市生活至关重要。作为智能交通系统中的关键功能之一，交通评估在现今起到了重要作用，而每日交通流量预测在整个网络范围的收费站仍面临挑战。一方面，实际中各个位置之间的数据不平衡状况加剧了预测的性能。另一方面，复杂的相关空时因素无法全面地应用于长期持续时间。本文提出了一种基于空时深度学习的高速公路每日交通流预测方法。在我们的方法中，采用数据归一化策略来处理数据不平衡，由于网络范围的收费站交通流的长尾分布。然后，基于图卷积网络，我们构建了具有不同语义的网络来捕捉空时特征。除此之外，我们的模型还使用了气象和日历特征。",
