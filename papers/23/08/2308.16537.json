    "abstract": "In medical research, the traditional way to collect data, i.e. browsing patient files, has been proven to induce bias, errors, human labor and costs. We propose a semi-automated system able to extract every type of data, including notes. The Smart Data Extractor pre-populates clinic research forms by following rules. We performed a cross-testing experiment to compare semi-automated to manual data collection. 20 target items had to be collected for 79 patients. The average time to complete one form was 6'81'' for manual data collection and 3'22'' with the Smart Data Extractor. There were also more mistakes during manual data collection (163 for the whole cohort) than with the Smart Data Extractor (46 for the whole cohort). We present an easy to use, understandable and agile solution to fill out clinical research forms. It reduces human effort and provides higher quality data, avoiding data re-entry and fatigue induced errors.",

    "translated_abstract": "在医学研究中，传统的数据收集方式，即查看病人档案，已经被证明会引起偏倚、错误、人力和成本。我们提出了一种半自动化系统，能够提取各种类型的数据，包括笔记。智能数据提取器通过遵循规则来预填临床研究表格。我们进行了一项交叉测试实验，将半自动化数据收集与手动数据收集进行比较。对于79名患者，需要收集20个目标项目。手动数据收集完成一个表格的平均时间为6分81秒，而智能数据提取器为3分22秒。手动数据收集中的错误数量（整个队列共163个）也比智能数据提取器（整个队列共46个）多。我们提供了一种易于使用、理解和灵活的解决方案，用于填写临床研究表格。它减少了人力投入，提供更高质量的数据，避免了数据重复输入和疲劳引起的错误。",
