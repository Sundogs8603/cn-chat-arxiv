    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了区块链Proof-of-Stake（PoS）协议中的机制设计问题。我们的主要目标是扩展最近在Chung和Shi（SODA，p.3856-3899，2023）中提出的交易手续费机制（TFM），以将矿工的长期效用模型纳入到Chung和Shi提出的燃烧二价拍卖机制BSP（γ）中（其中γ是严格γ-效用模型中应用于矿工和用户的关键参数）。首先，我们采用鞅方法推导出矿工长期效用的显式函数形式，并揭示了效用函数的关键不连续性，即微小的不真实行为将导致矿工效用的离散跳跃（向上或向下）。我们证明了由于这种不连续性，BSP（γ）机制将无法满足TFM中的一个关键期望性质，即c-侧合同证明性（c-SCP）。作为补救措施，我们引入了另一个参数θ，并提出了一个新的机制来解决这个问题。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the transaction fee mechanism in the Proof-of-Stake protocol and extends the existing mechanism to incorporate the long-term utility model for miners. By deriving the explicit utility function for miners, an important discontinuity in the utility function is revealed, which leads to the failure of the existing mechanism to satisfy key expected properties. To address this issue, a new parameter is introduced, and a new mechanism is proposed."
