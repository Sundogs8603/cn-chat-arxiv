    "translated_abstract": "发现治疗复杂疾病的新药候选物仍然是早期发现研究中最具挑战性的任务之一。为了解决这个挑战，生物医药研究建立了一个标准化的高内容成像协议，对每个图像通道进行不同的细胞区域标记。为了评判实验结果，科学家需要了解与某种表型相关的通道重要性，以解码潜在的生物学。与传统的图像分析方法相比，这种实验现在更倾向于使用基于深度学习的方法进行分析，然而，这些方法缺乏关于通道重要性的关键信息。为了克服这个局限性，我们提出了一种新方法，利用高内容图像的多光谱信息来解释细胞生物学的某个方面。为此，我们基于图像混合概念和alpha混合方法，对任意数量的通道进行处理。",
