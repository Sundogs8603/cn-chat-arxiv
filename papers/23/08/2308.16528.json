    "abstract": "To enable meaningful robotic manipulation of objects in the real-world, 6D pose estimation is one of the critical aspects. Most existing approaches have difficulties to extend predictions to scenarios where novel object instances are continuously introduced, especially with heavy occlusions. In this work, we propose a few-shot pose estimation (FSPE) approach called SA6D, which uses a self-adaptive segmentation module to identify the novel target object and construct a point cloud model of the target object using only a small number of cluttered reference images. Unlike existing methods, SA6D does not require object-centric reference images or any additional object information, making it a more generalizable and scalable solution across categories. We evaluate SA6D on real-world tabletop object datasets and demonstrate that SA6D outperforms existing FSPE methods, particularly in cluttered scenes with occlusions, while requiring fewer reference images.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了在真实环境中实现对物体的有意义的机器人操作，6D姿态估计是一个关键的方面。大多数现有方法在将预测扩展到不断引入新物体实例的场景，特别是重度遮挡的情况下存在困难。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种称为SA6D的少样本姿态估计（FSPE）方法，它使用自适应分割模块识别新颖目标对象，并使用仅有少量混杂参考图像构建目标对象的点云模型。与现有方法不同，SA6D不需要面向对象的参考图像或任何其他对象信息，使其成为一个更具通用性和可扩展性的解决方案。",
