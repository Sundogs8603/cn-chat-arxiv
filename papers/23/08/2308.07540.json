    "translated_abstract": "在游戏龙与地下城中，Dungeon Master（DM）的角色是同时执行多个任务。DM必须了解游戏背景和怪物的信息，综合场景展示给其他玩家，并对玩家与场景的互动作出响应。在保持故事连贯性的同时完成所有任务对于人类认知来说是一项不小的挑战，使新玩家难以接近和理解。大型语言模型（LLMs）如GPT-3和ChatGPT表现出生成连贯自然语言文本的非凡能力。在本文中，我们与DM进行了一项初步评估，以确定在龙与地下城和桌面游戏等领域中使用LLMs的用例。我们介绍了CALYPSO，这是一个由LLM驱动的界面系统，为DM提供与他们自己的场景相关的信息和灵感支持。CALYPSO将游戏背景转化为简洁的散文，并帮助DM在游戏过程中进行头脑风暴，而不会分散DM的注意力。",
