    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了如何在无法测量的混淆因素存在的情况下，扩展扩散模型的使用，以从观测数据中回答因果问题。在Pearl的使用有向无环图（DAG）捕捉因果干预的框架中，提出了一种基于扩散模型的因果模型（DCM），可以更准确地回答因果问题，假设所有混淆因素都是可以观察到的。然而，实际中存在无法测量的混淆因素，这使得DCM无法应用。为了缓解DCM的这一局限性，我们提出了一个扩展模型，称为基于反门准则的DCM（BDCM），其思想根植于在DAG中找到要包括在扩散模型解码过程中的变量的反门准则，这样我们可以将DCM扩展到存在无法测量的混淆因素的情况。合成数据实验表明，我们提出的模型在无法测量混淆因素的情况下更精确地捕捉到了反事实分布。",
