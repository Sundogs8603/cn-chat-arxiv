    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）取得了显著的成功。然而，LVLMs仍然存在幻觉问题，这限制了在许多场景中的实用性。幻觉指的是LVLMs响应中不存在于视觉输入中的信息，这可能导致重大后果的潜在风险。目前对LVLMs中的幻觉评估的研究工作有限。在本文中，我们提出了基于大型语言模型（LLM）的幻觉评估框架HaELM。HaELM的性能近似于ChatGPT的95%，并具有低成本、可复现、保护隐私和本地部署等额外优势。利用HaELM，我们评估了当前LVLMs中的幻觉。此外，我们分析了导致LVLMs中幻觉的因素，并提出了缓解幻觉问题的有用建议。",
