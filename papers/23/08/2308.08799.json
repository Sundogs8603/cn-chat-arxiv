    "translated_abstract": "随着时间的推移，推荐系统已经越来越受到研究的关注。大多数现有的推荐方法侧重于通过历史的用户-项目交互来捕捉用户的个性化偏好，这可能会侵犯用户的隐私。此外，这些方法常常忽视了项目流行度的时间波动对用户决策的重要性。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了Popularity-Aware Recommender（PARE），通过预测将达到最高流行度的项目来进行非个性化推荐。PARE由四个模块组成，分别关注不同的方面：流行度历史、时间影响、周期性影响和附加信息。最后，利用注意力层融合四个模块的输出。据我们所知，这是第一个在推荐系统中明确建模项目流行度的工作。广泛的实验证明，PARE的性能与复杂的方法相当甚至更好。",
