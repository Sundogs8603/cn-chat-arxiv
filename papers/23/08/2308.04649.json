    "abstract": "This research paper presents a novel approach to enhance optimization performance through the hybridization of Gaussian Crunching Search (GCS) and Powell's Method for derivative-free optimization. While GCS has shown promise in overcoming challenges faced by traditional derivative-free optimization methods [1], it may not always excel in finding the local minimum. On the other hand, some traditional methods may have better performance in this regard. However, GCS demonstrates its strength in escaping the trap of local minima and approaching the global minima. Through experimentation, we discovered that by combining GCS with certain traditional derivative-free optimization methods, we can significantly boost performance while retaining the respective advantages of each method. This hybrid approach opens up new possibilities for optimizing complex systems and finding optimal solutions in a range of applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇研究论文介绍了一种通过高斯崩溃搜索(GCS)和Powell's Method的混合来增强优化性能的新方法。尽管GCS已经显示出克服传统无导数优化方法所面临挑战的潜力[1]，但它可能不总是在寻找局部最小值方面表现出色。另一方面，一些传统方法在这方面的表现可能更好。然而，GCS展示了其在逃离局部极小值陷阱和接近全局极小值方面的优势。通过实验证明，通过将GCS与某些传统的无导数优化方法相结合，我们可以在保留每种方法的各自优点的同时显著提高性能。这种混合方法为优化复杂系统和在各种应用中寻找最优解打开了新的可能性。",
