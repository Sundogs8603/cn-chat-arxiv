    "translated_abstract": "人脸变形是计算机图形学中的一个重要问题，具有众多艺术和取证应用。由于姿态、光照、性别和种族的变化，它一直以来都是一个具有挑战性的问题。通常，这个任务包括特征对齐的变形和无缝过渡的混合。我们提出利用基于坐标的神经网络来表示人脸图像的这种变形和混合。在训练过程中，我们利用这种网络的平滑性和灵活性，结合了经典方法中使用的能量函数，而无需进行离散化。此外，我们的方法是时间依赖的，允许对目标图像进行连续的变形和混合。在变形推理过程中，我们需要时间依赖变形的直接和逆变换。前者负责将目标图像变形为源图像，而后者则用于在相反方向进行变形。我们的神经变形网络具有高效、准确和多样化的性能。",
