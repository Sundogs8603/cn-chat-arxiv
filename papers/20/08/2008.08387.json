    "abstract": "We introduce a new approach for comparing the predictive accuracy of two nested models that bypasses the difficulties caused by the degeneracy of the asymptotic variance of forecast error loss differentials used in the construction of commonly used predictive comparison statistics. Our approach continues to rely on the out of sample MSE loss differentials between the two competing models, leads to nuisance parameter free Gaussian asymptotics and is shown to remain valid under flexible assumptions that can accommodate heteroskedasticity and the presence of mixed predictors (e.g. stationary and local to unit root). A local power analysis also establishes its ability to detect departures from the null in both stationary and persistent settings. Simulations calibrated to common economic and financial applications indicate that our methods have strong power with good size control across commonly encountered sample sizes.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的方法，用于比较两个嵌套模型的预测准确性，避免了常用的预测比较统计中由预测误差损失差异的渐近方差退化引起的困难。我们的方法仍然依赖于两个竞争模型之间的样本外均方误差损失差异，在灵活的假设下保持有效，可以适应异方差和混合预测变量（如平稳和局部单位根）的存在。局部功率分析还确定了该方法在稳态和持久性环境中检测偏离零假设的能力。根据常见的经济和金融应用进行校准的模拟表明，我们的方法具有良好的功效和对常见样本量的良好大小控制。",
