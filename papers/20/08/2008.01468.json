    "abstract": "Understanding decisions made by neural networks is key for the deployment of intelligent systems in real world applications. However, the opaque decision making process of these systems is a disadvantage where interpretability is essential. Many feature-based explanation techniques have been introduced over the last few years in the field of machine learning to better understand decisions made by neural networks and have become an important component to verify their reasoning capabilities. However, existing methods do not allow statements to be made about the uncertainty regarding a feature's relevance for the prediction. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Relevance Propagation (MCRP) for feature relevance uncertainty estimation. A simple but powerful method based on Monte Carlo estimation of the feature relevance distribution to compute feature relevance uncertainty scores that allow a deeper understanding of a neural network's perception and reasoning.",

    "translated_abstract": "理解神经网络决策是实现智能系统在现实应用中的关键，然而这些系统不透明的决策过程在需要解释性的情况下是不利的。为了更好地理解神经网络的决策，机器学习领域近年来引入了许多特征解释技术，并成为验证其推理能力的重要组成部分。然而，现有方法并不允许关于特征相关性的不确定性进行陈述。本文提出了一种基于蒙特卡罗估计的特征相关性分布的计算方法，即Monte Carlo Relevance Propagation (MCRP)用于特征相关性的不确定性估计，以计算特征相关性不确定性分数，从而深入理解神经网络的感知和推理。",
