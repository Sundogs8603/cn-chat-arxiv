    "abstract": "The class of recurrent mixture density networks is an important class of probabilistic models used extensively in sequence modeling and sequence-to-sequence mapping applications. In this class of models, the density of a target sequence in each time-step is modeled by a Gaussian mixture model with the parameters given by a recurrent neural network. In this paper, we generalize recurrent mixture density networks by defining a Gaussian mixture model on a non-linearly transformed target sequence in each time-step. The non-linearly transformed space is created by normalizing flow. We observed that this model significantly improves the fit to image sequences measured by the log-likelihood. We also applied the proposed model on some speech and image data, and observed that the model has significant modeling power outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in terms of the log-likelihood.",
