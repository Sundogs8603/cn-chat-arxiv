    "abstract": "A priority system has traditionally been the protocol of choice for the allocation of scarce life-saving resources during public health emergencies. Covid-19 revealed the limitations of this allocation rule. Many argue that priority systems abandon ethical values such as equity by discriminating against disadvantaged communities. We show that a restrictive feature of the traditional priority system largely drives these limitations. Following minimalist market design, an institution design paradigm that integrates research and policy efforts, we formulate pandemic allocation of scarce life-saving resources as a new application of market design. Interfering only with the restrictive feature of the priority system to address its shortcomings, we formulate a reserve system as an alternative allocation rule. Our theoretical analysis develops a general theory of reserve design. We relate our analysis to debates during Covid-19 and describe the impact of our paper on policy and practice.",

    "translated_abstract": "在公共卫生紧急情况下，传统的优先级系统一直是稀缺救生资源分配的选择协议。Covid-19揭示了这种分配规则的局限性。许多人认为，优先级系统通过歧视弱势社区而抛弃了公平等伦理价值观。我们展示了传统优先级系统的限制性特征在很大程度上推动了这些局限性。遵循最小市场设计原则，这是一个整合了研究和政策工作的机构设计范例，我们将稀缺救生资源的大流行分配形式化为市场设计的一个新应用。只干预优先级系统的限制特征来解决其缺点，我们制定了储备系统作为替代分配规则。我们的理论分析发展出了一个储备设计的通用理论。我们将我们的分析与Covid-19期间的讨论联系起来，并描述了我们的论文对政策和实践的影响。",
