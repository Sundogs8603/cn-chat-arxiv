    "translated_abstract": "停车是发展中国家中不可避免的问题。随着车辆数量的增加，需要为停车分配更多的城市土地。然而，在印度等发展中国家，停车问题一直没有得到足够的关注。本研究提出了一个模型，用于分析汽车用户的社会经济和出行特征对停车时长的影响。具体而言，采用人工神经网络（ANNs）来捕捉驾驶员特征和停车时长之间的相互关系。ANNs在学习和识别参数之间的连接上非常高效，以最佳预测结果。然而，由于其黑盒特性，ANNs的实用性受到严重限制。因此，本研究使用Garson算法和局部可解释模型不受限的解释（LIME）进行模型解释。LIME通过将局部数据与开发的可解释模型进行局部逼近，展示了任何分类的预测结果。",
