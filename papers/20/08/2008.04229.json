    "abstract": "We introduce the *decision-conflict logit*, a simple and disciplined extension of the logit with an outside option that assigns a menu-dependent utility to that option. The relative value of this utility at a menu could be interpreted as proxying decision difficulty and determines the probability of avoiding/delaying choice at that menu. We focus on two intuitively structured special cases of the model that offer complementary insights, and argue that they explain a variety of observed choice-deferral effects that are caused by hard decisions. We conclude by illustrating the usability of the proposed modelling framework in applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种简单而有纪律性的扩展逻辑回归模型——决策冲突逻辑回归模型，该模型具有一个包含菜单相关效用的外部选择选项。这个选项的相对价值可以被解释为决策难度的代理变量，并决定了在该菜单上避免/延迟选择的概率。我们重点研究模型的两个直观结构的特殊情况，这给出了互补的见解，并论证了它们解释了由于难决策引起的各种观察到的推迟决策效应。最后，我们通过展示该建议模型框架的实用性来总结。",
