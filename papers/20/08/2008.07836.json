Since there are many variables in financial statements, it is crucial to determine the causal relationships, that is, the directional influence between them in a structural way, as well as to understand the associated accounting mechanisms. However, the analysis of variable-to-variable relationships in financial information using standard correlation functions is not sufficient to unveil directionality. Here, we use the volatility constrained correlation (VC correlation) method to predict the directional relationship between two arbitrary variables. We apply the VC correlation method to five significant financial information variables (revenue, net income, operating income, own capital, and market capitalization) of 2321 firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange over 28 years from 1990 to 2018.",

    "translated_abstract": "金融数据，例如财务报表，包含有价值且关键的信息，可以帮助利益相关者和投资者优化他们的资本以最大化整体经济增长。由于财务报表中有许多变量，因此决定它们之间因果关系，也就是方向影响，以及理解相关的会计机制非常重要。然而，使用标准相关函数分析财务信息中变量之间的关系并不足以揭示方向性。在这里，我们使用波动限制相关性（VC相关性）方法来预测两个任意变量之间的方向关系。我们将VC相关性方法应用于2321家上市于东京证券交易所的公司的28年（1990年至2018年）中的五个重要的财务信息变量（收入、净利润、营业利润、自有资本和市场资本）。",
