    "translated_abstract": "随着智能交通系统和车载通信的快速发展，车辆边缘计算（VEC）正在成为支持低延迟ITS应用和服务的有前途的技术。本文考虑了在异构VEC场景中，从移动车辆/用户计算卸载的问题，并关注选择不同网络的网络和基站选择问题。在快速变化的车载环境中，用户的计算卸载体验受到与基站共存的边缘计算服务器拥塞引起的延迟的强烈影响。然而，由于这种环境的非平稳特性和信息短缺，预测这种拥塞是一个复杂的任务。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了基于多臂老虎机理论的在线学习算法和Off-policy学习算法。以动态选择最小卸载时间为目标，通过在一群车辆和基站间权衡计算卸载体验和网络负载，我们证明了所提方法的有效性。",
