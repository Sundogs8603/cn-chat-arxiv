    "translated_abstract": "该论文详细回顾了强化学习在组合优化中的应用，介绍了从1950年代开始的组合优化历史，并将其与近年来的强化学习算法进行了比较。论文特别关注了著名的组合问题——旅行推销员问题（TSP）。它将现代强化学习算法在TSP上的方法与1970年代发表的一种方法进行了比较。通过比较这些方法之间的相似性和差异性，论文展示了由于机器学习技术和计算能力的进化，强化学习算法是如何进行优化的。论文随后简要介绍了TSP中的深度强化学习方法，即基于传统数学框架的深度强化学习。在深度强化学习中，引入了注意力和特征编码机制，以生成近似最优解。调查结果显示，将注意力等深度学习机制与强化学习相结合，可以有效地近似解决组合优化问题。",
