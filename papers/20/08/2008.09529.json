    "abstract": "We examine the design of optimal rating systems in the presence of moral hazard. First, an intermediary commits to a rating scheme. Then, a decision-maker chooses an action that generates value for the buyer. The intermediary then observes a noisy signal of the decision-maker's choice and sends the buyer a signal consistent with the rating scheme. Here we fully characterize the set of allocations that can arise in equilibrium under any arbitrary rating system. We use this characterization to study various design aspects of optimal rating systems. Specifically, we study the properties of optimal ratings when the decision-maker's effort is productive and when the decision-maker can manipulate the intermediary's signal with a noise. With manipulation, rating uncertainty is a fairly robust feature of optimal rating systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在存在道德风险情况下最优评级系统的设计。首先，一个中介机构承诺采用一种评级方案。然后，决策者选择为买方创造价值的行动。中介机构随后观察到决策者选择的噪声信号，并向买方发送与评级方案一致的信号。我们完全刻画了在任意评级系统下可能出现的均衡分配集合。利用这个刻画，我们研究了最优评级系统的各种设计方面。具体来说，我们研究了当决策者的努力是有生产力的时候，以及当决策者可以通过噪声操纵中介机构的信号时，最优评级的特性。在操纵的情况下，评级的不确定性是最优评级系统的一个相对稳健的特征。",
