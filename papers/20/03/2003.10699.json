    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a psychology-inspired approach to model and predict the music genre preferences of different groups of users by utilizing human memory processes. These processes describe how humans access information units in their memory by considering the factors of (i) past usage frequency, (ii) past usage recency, and (iii) the current context. Using a publicly available dataset of more than a billion music listening records shared on the music streaming platform Last.fm, we find that our approach provides significantly better prediction accuracy results than various baseline algorithms for all evaluated user groups, i.e., (i) low-mainstream music listeners, (ii) medium-mainstream music listeners, and (iii) high-mainstream music listeners. Furthermore, our approach is based on a simple psychological model, which contributes to the transparency and explainability of the calculated predictions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种受心理学启发的方法，通过利用人类记忆过程来模拟和预测不同用户群体的音乐类型偏好。这些过程描述了人类如何通过考虑过去使用频率、过去使用时效以及当前上下文来访问其记忆中的信息单元。使用公开可用的超过十亿条在音乐流媒体平台Last.fm上分享的音乐收听记录数据集，我们发现我们的方法对于所有评估的用户群体，即低主流音乐听众、中等主流音乐听众和高主流音乐听众，提供了显著更好的预测准确性结果。此外，我们的方法基于一个简单的心理模型，有助于透明和可解释性的计算预测。",
