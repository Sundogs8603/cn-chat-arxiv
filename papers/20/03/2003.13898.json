    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的 ECGAN 用于挑战性的语义图像合成任务。虽然已经取得了相当大的进展，但合成图像的质量仍然不尽如人意，原因有三个：1）语义标签没有提供详细的结构信息，使得合成局部细节和结构变得困难；2）广泛采用的 CNN 操作，如卷积、下采样和归一化通常会导致空间分辨率的损失，不能完全保留原始的语义信息，导致语义不一致的结果；3）现有的语义图像合成方法主要关注从单个输入语义布局建模局部语义信息。然而，它们忽略了多个输入语义布局的全局语义信息，即跨不同输入布局的像素之间的语义交叉关系。为了解决第一个问题，我们提出使用边缘作为中间表示，并进一步采用其来引导图像合成。",
