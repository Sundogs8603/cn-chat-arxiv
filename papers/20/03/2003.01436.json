For example, we can study the interrelationships between genes in a gene regulatory network of a certain disease conditioned on their gene expression data recorded as time series.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于深度学习的方法已被用于建模和生成符合不同分布的图。然而，它们通常是基于无监督学习的、无条件的生成模型，或者仅基于图级上下文条件生成，这与丰富的语义节点级上下文无关。不同地，在本文中，我们对一个名为时间序列条件图生成的新问题感兴趣：给定一个输入的多变量时间序列，我们的目标是推断一个目标关系图，该图建模了时间序列之间的潜在相互关系，其中每个节点对应一个时间序列。例如，我们可以研究以基因表达数据作为时间序列条件的某种疾病的基因调控网络中基因之间的相互关系。为了实现这个目标，我们提出了一种新颖的时间序列条件图生成-生成对抗网络（TSGG-GAN）来处理丰富的节点级上下文结构的挑战。",
