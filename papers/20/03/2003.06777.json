    "translated_abstract": "本文从图像区域之间最优匹配的角度出发，提出了一种few-shot图像分类方法。我们采用Earth Mover's Distance（EMD）作为衡量密集图像表示结构距离的度量方法，以决定图像的相似度。EMD为结构元素生成最佳匹配流，这些流具有最小的匹配代价，用于计算分类的图像距离。我们设计了一个交叉参考机制来生成EMD公式中元素的权重，它可以有效缓解杂乱背景和大量类内外观变化所引起的不良影响。我们提出学习一个结构化全连接层，直接使用EMD对密集图像表示进行分类，以实现k-shot分类。基于隐函数定理，在网络中插入EMD层进行端到端的训练。在基准数据集上进行的广泛实验结果表明，我们的方法在few-shot图像分类上实现了最先进的性能。",
