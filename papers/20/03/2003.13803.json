The test procedure is based on two different projection arguments, leading to test statistics that are suitable to setups with many covariates, and are (asymptotically) invariant to the estimation method used to estimate the nuisance parameters. We show that our proposed tests are able to detect a broad class of local alternatives converging to the null at the usual parametric rate and illustrate its attractive power properties via simulations. We also extend our proposal to test parametric or semiparametric single-index-type models.",
