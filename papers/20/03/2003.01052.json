    "abstract": "Centrality metrics are vital for network analysis, but selecting the most appropriate measures for specific applications remains challenging among the 400+ proposed indices. Existing approaches -- model-based, data-driven, and axiomatic -- have limitations. To address this, we introduce the culling method, leveraging expert preferences regarding centrality behavior on simple graphs. It involves forming a set of candidate measures, generating a list of as small graphs as possible needed to ``separate'' measures from each other, constructing a decision-tree survey, and identifying the measure consistent with expert responses. We apply this method to a diverse set of 40 centralities, including new kernel-based measures, and combine it with the axiomatic approach. Remarkably, only 13 small 1-trees suffice to separate all 40 measures, among which there are pairs of close ones. The culling method offers a low-cost solution in terms of labor and time, complements existing methods for measure ",

    "translated_abstract": "中心度度量在网络分析中至关重要，但在400多种提出的指标中选择最合适的测量方法仍然具有挑战性。现有方法-基于模型、数据驱动和公理性-存在局限性。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了缩减方法，利用专家对简单图中的中心度行为的偏好。它涉及形成一组候选测量方法，生成尽可能小的图形以“分离”各种测量方法，构建决策树调查，并确定与专家回答一致的测量方法。我们将这种方法应用于包括新的基于核的测量方法在内的40种不同中心度，同时与公理性方法结合。值得注意的是，只有13个小型1-树足以分离所有40个测量方法，其中包括接近的一对。缩减方法在劳动力和时间方面提供了一种低成本的解决方案，为已有的测量方法提供了补充。",
