We propose a cross-shape attention mechanism to enable interactions between a shape's point-wise features and those of other shapes. The mechanism assesses both the degree of interaction between points and also mediates feature propagation across shapes, improving the accuracy and consistency of the resulting point-wise feature representations for shape segmentation. Our method also proposes a shape retrieval measure to select suitable shapes for cross-shape attention operations for each test shape. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach yields state-of-the-art results in the popular PartNet dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种深度学习方法，通过在形状集合中传递逐点特征表示来进行三维形状分割。我们提出了一种交叉形状注意力机制，以使一个形状的逐点特征与其他形状的逐点特征产生相互作用。该机制评估点之间的交互程度并在形状之间介导特征传播，从而改善了用于形状分割的结果的点逐点特征表示的精度和一致性。我们的方法还提出了一种形状检索度量，以选择适合每个测试形状的交叉形状注意力操作的形状。我们的实验证明，我们的方法在流行的PartNet数据集上实现了最先进的结果。",
