    "translated_abstract": "现在医院常用的 CT 扫描仪可产生最大 512 像素的低分辨率图像，图像中的一个像素对应组织的一毫米。为了准确地分割肿瘤并制定治疗计划，医生需要更高分辨率的 CT 扫描。同样的问题也出现在 MRI 中。本文提出了一种用于单张图像的 3D CT 或 MRI 扫描超分辨率的方法。我们的方法基于深度卷积神经网络（CNN），包括 10 个卷积层和一个中间上采样层，该层放置在前 6 个卷积层之后。我们的第一个 CNN 通过两个轴（宽度和高度）增加分辨率，紧接着是第二个 CNN，它增加了第三个轴（深度）的分辨率。与其他方法不同的是，我们在上采样层后立即计算与高分辨率输出的真值相关的损失，除了最后一个卷积层后计算的损失。中间损失有助于缓解梯度消失问题并提高准确性。我们在两个公共数据集上评估了我们的方法，并展示了它在量化度量和视觉质量方面均优于现有方法。",

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually."
