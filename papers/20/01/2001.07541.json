We consider a setting recently introduced for ontology-based data access, based on semirings and extending classical data provenance, in which ontology axioms are annotated with provenance tokens. A consequence inherits the provenance of the axioms involved in deriving it, yielding a provenance polynomial as an annotation. We analyse the semantics for the ELHr case and show that the presence of conjunctions poses various difficulties for handling provenance, some of which are mitigated by assuming multiplicative idempotency of the semiring. Under this assumption, we study three problems: ontology completion with provenance, computing the set of relevant axioms for a consequence, and query answering.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了处理ELHr本体中的溯源信息的问题。我们考虑了最近在基于本体的数据访问中引入的一个设置，该设置基于半环并扩展了经典数据溯源，在该设置中，本体公理附有溯源标记。后果会继承衍生它的公理的溯源，产生一个溯源多项式作为注释。我们分析了ELHr情况下的语义，并展示了合取操作对处理溯源提出了各种困难，其中一些困难可以通过假设半环具有乘法幂等性来减轻。在这个假设下，我们研究了三个问题：带有溯源的本体补全、计算与后果相关的公理集合以及查询回答。",
