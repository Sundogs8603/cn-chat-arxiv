Using a discrete-time approach with martingale tools, we establish under mild assumptions the weak convergence of the rescaled sequence of iterates for a broad class of conditioning matrices including stochastic first-order and second-order methods. Almost sure convergence results, which may be of independent interest, are also presented. Interestingly, the asymptotic normality result consists in a stochastic equicontinuity property so when the conditioning matrix is an estimate of the inverse Hessian, the algorithm is asymptotically optimal.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一类称为条件随机梯度下降（SGD）算法的一般类别，该算法基于梯度方向的预条件。使用离散时间方法和鞅工具，我们在较弱的假设下证明了迭代序列的重新缩放收敛性，适用于包括随机一阶和二阶方法在内的广泛条件矩阵类别。同时还介绍了具有独立兴趣的几乎肯定收敛的结果。有趣的是，渐近正态性结果包括一个随机等连续性性质，因此当条件矩阵是逆Hessian的估计时，该算法是渐近最优的。",
