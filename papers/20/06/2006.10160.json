    "translated_abstract": "高斯过程是一种有效的模型类，特别是在精确表示预测不确定性很重要的情况下。受物理科学应用的启发，最近将广泛使用的Matérn高斯过程推广到模拟定义在黎曼流形上的函数，通过将这些过程重新表示为随机偏微分方程的解来实现。在本文中，我们提出了通过拉普拉斯-贝尔特拉米算子的谱理论在紧黎曼流形上计算这些过程的核心技术，从而使它们可以通过标准可扩展技术（例如诱导点方法）进行训练。我们还将该推广从Matérn推广到广泛使用的平方指数高斯过程。通过允许使用众所周知的技术对Riemannian Matérn高斯过程进行训练，我们的工作使它们能够得到广泛应用。",
