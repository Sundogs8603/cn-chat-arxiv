    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19的爆发以其相对快速的传播而震惊了整个世界，并对不同的领域提出了挑战。限制其传播的最有效方法之一是对感染者进行早期和准确的诊断。医学影像，如X光和计算机断层扫描(CT)，结合人工智能(AI)的潜力，在诊断过程中起着支持医务人员的关键作用。因此，本文使用五种不同的深度学习模型(ResNet18、ResNet34、InceptionV3、InceptionResNetV2和DenseNet161)及其集成，通过多数投票的方式，使用胸部X光图像对COVID-19、肺炎和健康对象进行分类。对于每个患者，进行多标签分类以预测其存在的多个病理。首先，通过局部可解释性方法-遮挡、显著性、输入X梯度、引导性反传、集成梯度来对每个网络的可解释性进行了详细研究。",
