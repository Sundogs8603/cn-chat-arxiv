    "translated_abstract": "生成对抗网络（GANs）在生成样本方面取得了极大的成功，从看似高维的概率分布中生成样本。然而，这些方法在捕捉由时间序列数据引起的联合概率分布的时序依赖性方面存在困难。此外，长时间序列数据流会极大地增加目标空间的维度，可能使生成建模变得不可行。为了克服这些挑战，受计量经济学中自回归模型的启发，我们对给定过去信息的未来时间序列的条件分布非常感兴趣。我们提出了一种通用的条件Sig-WGAN框架，通过将Wasserstein-GANs（WGANs）与数学上有原则且高效的路径特征提取技术——路径的签名相结合。路径的签名是一系列分级统计量，为数据流提供了一个通用的描述，其期望值刻画了时间序列模型的分布特征。",
