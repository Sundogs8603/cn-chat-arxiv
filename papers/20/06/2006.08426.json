    "abstract": "Descent directions such as movement towards Descent directions, including movement towards Frank-Wolfe vertices, away-steps, in-face away-steps and pairwise directions, have been an important design consideration in conditional gradient descent (CGD) variants. In this work, we attempt to demystify the impact of the movement in these directions towards attaining constrained minimizers. The optimal local direction of descent is the directional derivative (i.e., shadow) of the projection of the negative gradient. We show that this direction is the best away-step possible, and the continuous-time dynamics of moving in the shadow is equivalent to the dynamics of projected gradient descent (PGD), although it's non-trivial to discretize. We also show that Frank-Wolfe (FW) vertices correspond to projecting onto the polytope using an \"infinite\" step in the direction of the negative gradient, thus providing a new perspective on these steps. We combine these insights into a novel Shadow-CG method",

    "translated_abstract": "降低方向，如朝向、Frank-Wolfe顶点、离开步骤、朝向内部的离开步骤和配对方向，是有条件梯度下降（CGD）变体中的重要设计考虑因素。我们试图揭示这些方向对于实现约束最小者的影响。最佳的本地降低方向是负梯度的投影的方向导数（即阴影）。我们展示了这个方向是可能的最佳离开步骤，并且在连续时间内，沿着阴影移动的动力学等同于投影梯度下降（PGD）的动力学，尽管离散化不是微不足道的。我们还展示了Frank-Wolfe（FW）顶点对应于使用负梯度方向上的“无限”步骤投影到多胞体上，从而提供了一个新的视角。我们将这些见解结合到一个新的Shadow-CG方法中。",
