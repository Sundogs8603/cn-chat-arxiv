    "abstract": "We present the Newspaper Bias Dataset (NewB), a text corpus of more than 200,000 sentences from eleven news sources regarding Donald Trump. While previous datasets have labeled sentences as either liberal or conservative, NewB covers the political views of eleven popular media sources, capturing more nuanced political viewpoints than a traditional binary classification system does. We train two state-of-the-art deep learning models to predict the news source of a given sentence from eleven newspapers and find that a recurrent neural network achieved top-1, top-3, and top-5 accuracies of 33.3%, 61.4%, and 77.6%, respectively, significantly outperforming a baseline logistic regression model's accuracies of 18.3%, 42.6%, and 60.8%. Using the news source label of sentences, we analyze the top n-grams with our model to gain meaningful insight into the portrayal of Trump by media sources.We hope that the public release of our dataset will encourage further research in using natural language ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了Newspaper Bias Dataset (NewB)，这是一个包含来自11个新闻来源关于唐纳德·特朗普的200,000多个句子的文本语料库。与以前的数据集将句子标记为自由派或保守派不同，NewB涵盖了11家热门媒体源的政治观点，捕捉到比传统的二元分类系统更细致的政治观点。我们训练了两个最先进的深度学习模型，以预测给定句子的新闻来源，结果发现一个循环神经网络的top-1、top-3和top-5准确率分别为33.3%、61.4%和77.6%，明显优于基准逻辑回归模型的准确率分别为18.3%、42.6%和60.8%。利用句子的新闻来源标签，我们使用模型分析了前n个词组，以深入了解媒体来源对特朗普的描绘。我们希望我们数据集的公开发布能鼓励进一步研究自然语言处理的应用。",
