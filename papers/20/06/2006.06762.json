    "translated_abstract": "高性能的张量程序对于保证深度神经网络的高效执行至关重要。然而，为不同的运算符在各种硬件平台上获得高性能张量程序是非常具有挑战性的。目前，深度学习系统依赖于供应商提供的内核库或各种搜索策略来获取高性能的张量程序。这些方法要么需要大量的工程工作来开发特定于平台的优化代码，要么由于受限的搜索空间和无效的探索策略而无法找到高性能的程序。我们提出了一种名为Ansor的张量程序生成框架，用于深度学习应用。与现有的搜索策略相比，Ansor通过从搜索空间的分层表示中采样程序来探索更多的优化组合。然后，Ansor使用进化搜索和学习的成本模型来对采样出的程序进行微调，以找到最佳程序。",
