    "translated_abstract": "尽管近年来有了一些进展，但在高维情况下学习由有向无环图（DAG）表示的因果结构仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务，尤其是当要学习的图不是稀疏的情况下。在本文中，我们提出利用关于DAG因果模型的（加权）邻接矩阵的低秩假设来解决这个问题。我们利用现有的低秩技术来调整因果结构学习方法，以充分利用这个假设，并建立一些有用的结果，将可解释的图形条件与低秩假设相关联。具体而言，我们表明最大秩与中心节点高度相关，这表明在实践中经常遇到的无标度网络往往是低秩的。我们的实验证明了低秩适应对于各种数据模型的实用性，特别是对于相对大且密集的图。此外，通过验证过程，适应性方法始终保持卓越或比以前的方法更好的性能。",
