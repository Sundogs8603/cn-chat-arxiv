    "translated_abstract": "在流体数值分析领域，存在一个长期以来的问题：缺乏一种严格的数学工具将连续流场映射到离散的涡旋粒子，从而使拉格朗日粒子无法继承大规模欧拉求解器的高分辨率。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的基于学习的框架，即神经涡旋方法（NVM），它通过构建拉格朗日涡旋结构及其相互作用动力学的神经网络描述，以物理精确的方式重构高分辨率的欧拉流场。我们基础设施的关键组成部分包括两个网络：一个涡旋表示网络用于识别基于网格的速度场中的拉格朗日涡旋，以及一个涡旋相互作用网络用于学习这些有限结构的潜在控制动力学。通过将这两个网络嵌入涡度到速度泊松求解器并使用高保真度的数据训练其参数。",
