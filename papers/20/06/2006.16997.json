    "abstract": "We consider the problem of inference in Difference-in-Differences (DID) when there are few treated units and errors are spatially correlated. We first show that, when there is a single treated unit, some existing inference methods designed for settings with few treated and many control units remain asymptotically valid when errors are weakly dependent. However, these methods may be invalid with more than one treated unit. We propose alternatives that are asymptotically valid in this setting, even when the relevant distance metric across units is unavailable.",
