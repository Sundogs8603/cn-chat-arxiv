    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了建模多个产品购买并利用该模型为在线零售商和电商平台提供优化推荐的问题。我们提出了一种简化的多次购买选择模型家族，称为Bundle-MVL-K家族，并开发了一种基于二分搜索的迭代策略，高效地计算出该模型的优化推荐。我们证明了计算最优推荐集的困难性，并推导出最优解的几个结构属性，以加速计算。这是对多次购买选择模型进行操作化的首次尝试之一。我们展示了建模多次购买行为与收入增益之间的首个定量联系。我们使用多个真实世界数据集，比较了我们的建模和优化技术与竞争解决方案在模型适配度、预期收入增益和运行时间减少等多个指标上的效果。例如，预期的收入增益比竞争解决方案更高。",
