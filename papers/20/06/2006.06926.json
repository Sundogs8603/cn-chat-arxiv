    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，模拟退火机器能够高精度地解决组合优化问题。模拟退火机器有潜力用于基于评分的贝叶斯网络结构学习。然而，模拟退火机器的比特容量目前有限。为了利用模拟退火技术，需要将基于评分的学习问题转化为在比特容量内的二次无约束二元优化问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种高效的转化方法，通过先进的候选父节点集合的确定和其分解。我们还提供了一个整数规划问题，以找到最小化所需比特数的分解。在包含变量从75到223的7个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的方法所需的比特数比四代富士通数字退火器（一种采用半导体技术开发的全耦合模拟退火机器）的100K比特容量少。",
