    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了两种鲁棒方法来测试在异质和持久波动性以及内生、持久和/或重尾回归变量和误差下的预测回归模型未知参数的假设。提出的鲁棒推断方法适用于离散和连续时间模型。这两种方法都使用Cauchy估计量来有效处理回归变量和误差中内生性、持久性和/或重尾性的问题。这两种方法的区别在于如何控制异质波动性。第一种方法依赖于在Ibragimov和Muller（2010）中提出的回归参数的群体估计量的鲁棒t统计推断。它实现简单，但需要外生波动性假设。为了放宽外生波动性假设，我们提出了另一种方法，依赖于波动率的非参数校正。与现有方法相比，我们提出的方法表现良好。",
