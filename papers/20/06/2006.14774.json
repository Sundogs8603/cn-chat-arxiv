    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了一种频谱共享问题，即在同一频段内同时运行统计（或广泛分布的）多输入多输出（MIMO）雷达和基频全双工（IBFD）多用户MIMO（MU-MIMO）通信系统。以往关于联合MIMO雷达-MIMO通信（MRMC）系统的工作主要集中在共位MIMO雷达、半双工MIMO通信、单用户场景，省略了实际约束（杂波、上行/下行发送功率、上行/下行服务质量和峰均功率比），或者采用分开的发送/接收单元的MRMC共存。本文的目的是共同设计一个MRMC框架，解决所有这些问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种分布式IBFD MRMC的信号处理方法，其中雷达接收机被设计为额外利用下行通信信号的反射。",
