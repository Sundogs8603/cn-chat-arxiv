We develop a characterisation of cointegration based on the impulse response function, which allows long-run equilibrium relationships to remain identified even in the absence of exact unit roots. Our approach also provides a framework in which the structural shocks driving the common persistent components continue to be identified via long-run restrictions, just as in an SVAR with exact unit roots.

    "translated_abstract": "自从1998年Elliott提出，在自回归根接近但并不完全等于1的情况下，协整关系的标准推断方法完全破裂。我们在结构向量自回归模型框架中考虑这个问题，并认为这不仅仅是推断问题，而是辨识失败问题。我们基于脉冲响应函数开发了一个协整特征，即使在没有精确单位根的情况下也可以保持长期均衡关系的确定性。我们的方法还提供了一个框架，使得驱动共同持久组成部分的结构性冲击可以通过长期限制继续被确定，就像在具有精确单位根的结构向量自回归模型中那样。我们展示了协整关系的推断受到干扰参数的影响，这在预测回归中是很常见的；事实上这两个问题在渐近意义下是等价的。通过改进Elliott、Müller和Watson(2005)的方法，我们导出了一致估计的协整向量，即使自回归根接近1时也仍保持一致。",
