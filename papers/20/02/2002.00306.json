    "translated_abstract": "要实现高学习准确性，生成对抗网络（GANs）必须以充分代表数据空间的大型数据集作为输入。然而，在许多情况下，可用的数据集可能是有限的，并且分布在多个代理之间，每个代理都试图单独学习数据的分布。在这种情况下，代理通常不愿共享他们的本地数据，因为这可能导致大型数据集的通信开销。本文提出了一种新颖的脑力风暴生成对抗网络（BGAN）架构，用于解决这个多代理GAN问题，多个代理可以在完全分布式的方式下生成类似真实数据的样本。BGAN允许代理通过共享生成的数据样本而不是实际数据集进行“脑力风暴”来获取来自其他代理的信息。与现有的分布式GAN解决方案相比，所提出的BGAN架构被设计为完全分布式，并且不需要参与方彼此通信。",
