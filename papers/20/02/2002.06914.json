    "translated_abstract": "本研究针对两种从知识图谱中增强信息的方法：链接预测和实体对齐，对其评估方法进行了深入研究。当前实验设置中，采用多个不同的评估指标来评估模型性能的不同方面。我们分析了这些评估指标的信息性，并发现了一些问题。特别地，我们证明了所有现有的评估指标几乎不能用于在不同数据集之间比较结果。此外，我们还证明了测试集大小的变化会对相同模型的性能产生影响，这是基于实体对齐任务常用度量标准的结果。我们展示了这导致了结果解释上的各种问题，可能支持误导性的结论。因此，我们提出了对评估方法的调整，并通过实验证明了如何实现对模型性能的公平、可比和可解释的评估。我们的代码可供使用。",
