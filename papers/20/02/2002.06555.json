    "translated_abstract": "商业周期在不同国家之间呈现正相关性（“共振”）。然而，那些把共振归因于外部冲击传导的标准模型很难产生与数据相同程度的共振。本文研究通过某种非线性动力学——极限环或混沌，来内生地产生商业周期的模型。这些模型产生更强的共振，因为它们将冲击传导与内生动态的同步化相结合。特别地，我们研究了一种需求驱动的模型，其中商业周期源于国内的战略互补性，并通过国际贸易联系同步振荡。我们开发了一种特征值分解方法来探讨非线性动力学、冲击传播和网络结构之间的相互作用，并使用这种理论来理解同步机制。接下来，我们将模型校准到24个国家的数据上，并展示了实证共振程度。",
