    "translated_abstract": "卷积神经网络(CNNs)在几十年的发展中，在分类任务中超越了现有的技术方法。然而，CNN在构建时被限制在欧几里得空间中进行操作。因为卷积是针对欧几里得空间定义的信号操作。这限制了深度学习主要用于欧几里得定义的数据，如声音或图像。而实际上，许多计算机应用领域(包括网络分析、计算社会科学、化学信息学或计算机图形学)涉及非欧几里得定义的数据，如图、网络或流形。本文提出了一种新的卷积神经网络架构，直接在图空间中定义。卷积和池化操作在图域中定义。我们展示了其在反向传播环境下使用的可行性。实验结果表明，我们的模型在简单任务上的性能达到了最先进水平，并且在图域变化方面表现稳健。",
