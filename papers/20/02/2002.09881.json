    "translated_abstract": "我们使用比特币、以太坊和瑞波等占据加密货币市场70%以上的数据，研究了加密货币的行为。我们证明了α稳定分布是一个适用于高度投机的加密货币的充分模型，其优于金融计量学中使用的其他重尾分布。我们发现，DuMouchel（1971）提出的极大似然方法比McCulloch（1986）的分位数方法和Koutrouvelis（1980）的样本特征方法更适合拟合加密货币的回报数据。实证结果表明，加密货币回报数据呈现出的尖峰厚尾特征可以被α稳定分布所捕捉到。这些发现突出了α稳定分布不仅仅具有四个自由参数的简洁性，而且是一种接近实际的创新模型。本文涵盖了加密货币的早期报告和文献资料。",
