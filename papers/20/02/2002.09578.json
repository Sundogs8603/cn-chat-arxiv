    "translated_abstract": "多元概率分布的预测在各种应用中都是必要的。得分规则使得可以评估预测准确性，并比较不同的预测方法。本文提出了一个针对多元分布得分规则的理论框架，其包括现有的二次得分规则和多元连续排名概率得分规则。我们展示了如何使用这个框架生成新的得分规则。在某些多元情境下，需要预测等级集，例如用于异常检测的密度等级集或累积分布的等级集作为风险度量。这促使考虑针对此类等级集的得分函数。对于单变量分布，连续排名概率得分可以表示为分位数得分的积分。我们展示了类似的方法，可以将多元分布的得分规则分解为等级集得分规则。我们提出的框架提供了一种多元得分规则的统一方法，为新的得分函数的开发提供了基础。",
