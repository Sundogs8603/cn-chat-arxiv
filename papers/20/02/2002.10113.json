    "abstract": "We present APAC-Net, an alternating population and agent control neural network for solving stochastic mean field games (MFGs). Our algorithm is geared toward high-dimensional instances of MFGs that are beyond reach with existing solution methods. We achieve this in two steps. First, we take advantage of the underlying variational primal-dual structure that MFGs exhibit and phrase it as a convex-concave saddle point problem. Second, we parameterize the value and density functions by two neural networks, respectively. By phrasing the problem in this manner, solving the MFG can be interpreted as a special case of training a generative adversarial network (GAN). We show the potential of our method on up to 100-dimensional MFG problems.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种交替人口和代理控制神经网络（APAC-Net）来解决随机均场博弈（MFG）问题。我们的算法针对高维度的MFG实例，这些实例使用现有解决方法无法解决。我们通过两个步骤实现这一目标。首先，我们利用MFG所展示的变分原始-对偶结构，并将其形式化为凸-凹鞍点问题。其次，我们分别通过两个神经网络对价值和密度函数进行参数化。通过这种方式，解决MFG可以被解释为训练生成对抗网络（GAN）的特例。我们展示了我们的方法在高达100维MFG问题上的潜力。",
