    "translated_abstract": "在经验研究中，部分观察到的网络中缺少网络链接的问题经常被忽略。本文旨在解决这个问题，同时研究了网络相互作用下计划收益的溢出。我们专注于一个允许灵活的异质性形式的非参数结果模型，并提出了两种方法来识别边界网络度的处理和溢出效应。当网络度无界时，这些方法可用于减轻由于缺失网络链接而造成的偏差。第一种方法利用基于传入和传出链接的两个易于构建的网络测量。第二种方法依赖于一个具有已知缺失率的单个网络测量。我们使用蒙特卡罗实验和基于真实世界学校网络数据的自然模拟演示了我们的方法提供的有效偏差减少。最后，我们在缺少网络链接的学校网络中重新研究了家庭电脑使用对儿童学业成绩的溢出。",
