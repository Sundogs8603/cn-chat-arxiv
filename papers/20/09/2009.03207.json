The learning to rank (LTR) framework models this problem as a sequential problem of selecting lists of content and observing where users decide to click. Most previous work on LTR assumes that the user considers each item in the list in isolation, and makes binary choices to click or not on each. We introduce a multinomial logit (MNL) choice model to the LTR framework, which captures the behaviour of users who consider the ordered list of items as a whole and make a single choice among all the items and a no-click option. Under the MNL model, the user favours items which are either inherently more attractive, or placed in a preferable position within the list. We propose upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms to minimise regret in two settings where the position dependent parameters are known, and unknown.

    "translated_abstract": "在网站设计中，学习最佳内容排序是一个重要的挑战。学习排序（LTR）框架将这个问题建模为选择内容列表并观察用户决定点击的顺序问题。大多数以前的LTR工作假设用户在列表中独立考虑每个项目，并对每个项目进行二选一的选择。我们引入了多项式Logit（MNL）选择模型到LTR框架中，它捕捉到用户将有序的项目列表作为一个整体，从所有项目和没有点击选项中做出一个选择的行为。在MNL模型下，用户更喜欢本质上更有吸引力的项目，或者处于列表中更可取的位置的项目。我们提出了上置信界（UCB）算法，以在已知和未知的位置依赖参数的两种设置中最小化遗憾。我们提出了理论分析，导致了对问题的$\\Omega（\\sqrt{JT}）$下限。",
