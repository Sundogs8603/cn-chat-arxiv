    "translated_abstract": "时变参数模型(TVPs)经常被用于经济学中来捕捉结构性变化。我强调了一个被忽视的事实——这些实际上是岭回归。这使得计算、调整和实现比状态空间范式更容易。在高维情况下，解决等价的双重岭问题的计算非常快,关键的“时间变化量”通常是由交叉验证来调整的。使用两步回归岭回归来处理不断变化的波动性。我考虑了基于稀疏性(算法选择哪些参数变化, 哪些不变)和降低秩约束的扩展(变化与因子模型相关联)。为了展示这种方法的有用性, 我使用它来研究加拿大货币政策的演变, 并使用大规模时变局部投影估计约4600个TVPs, 这一任务完全可以利用这种新方法完成。",
