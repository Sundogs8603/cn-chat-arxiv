    "abstract": "The problem of synchronization over a group $\\mathcal{G}$ aims to estimate a collection of group elements $G^*_1, \\dots, G^*_n \\in \\mathcal{G}$ based on noisy observations of a subset of all pairwise ratios of the form $G^*_i {G^*_j}^{-1}$. Such a problem has gained much attention recently and finds many applications across a wide range of scientific and engineering areas. In this paper, we consider the class of synchronization problems in which the group is a closed subgroup of the orthogonal group. This class covers many group synchronization problems that arise in practice. Our contribution is fivefold. First, we propose a unified approach for solving this class of group synchronization problems, which consists of a suitable initialization step and an iterative refinement step based on the generalized power method, and show that it enjoys a strong theoretical guarantee on the estimation error under certain assumptions on the group, measurement graph, noise, and initialization.

    "translated_abstract": "同步问题旨在估计一组群元素$G^*_1,\\dots,G^*_n\\in\\mathcal{G}$,基于形如$G^*_i{G^*_j}^{-1}$的所有成对比率子集的嘈杂观测。本文考虑群为正交群的同步问题。我们提出了一种统一的解决方案，它由适当的初始化步骤和基于广义幂法的迭代细化步骤组成，并表明它在对群、测量图、噪声和初始化的某些假设下具有强大的理论保证。",
