    "translated_abstract": "个体认知表型的快速测量具有革命性的潜力，可在个性化学习、就业实践和精准精神病学等广泛领域得到应用。为了超越传统实验室实验所带来的限制，人们正在努力增加生态效度和参与者多样性，以捕捉普通人群中认知能力和行为的个体差异的全部范围。基于此，我们开发了Skill Lab，一种新型的基于游戏的工具，它在提供引人入胜的故事情节的同时评估广泛的认知能力。Skill Lab由六个小游戏和14个已知的认知能力任务组成。利用一个流行的公民科学平台（N = 10725），我们在真实环境中进行了一项全面的基于游戏的认知评估。基于游戏和验证任务的数据，我们构建了可靠的模型，同时预测八种认知能力。",
