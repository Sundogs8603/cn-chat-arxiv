The biased signals of extreme voters hinder accountability and selection, but partisan disagreement can create a balancing effect that makes centrist voters more pivotal. The combined effect on accountability and selection can actually be positive if centrist voters' unbiased signals are informative, which can help combat negative factors such as mass polarization and shrinking attention spans in political discourse."
