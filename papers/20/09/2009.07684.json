    "abstract": "We assess the correlation between CAP support provided to farmers and their income and use of capital and labour in the first year of the new CAP regime. This is done applying three regression models on the Italian FADN farms controlling for other farm characteristics. CAP annual payments are positively correlated with farm income and capital but are negatively correlated with labour use. Farm investment support provided by RDP measures is positively correlated to the amount of capital. Results suggest that CAP is positively affecting farm income directly but also indirectly by supporting the substitution of labour with capital",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究评估了向农民提供的CAP支持与农场收入、资本和劳动力使用之间的相关性，并应用三个回归模型对意大利FADN农场进行控制。CAP年度支付与农场收入和资本呈正相关，但与劳动力使用呈负相关。通过RDP措施提供的农场投资支持与资本数量呈正相关。结果表明，CAP对农场收入的影响既是直接的，也是通过支持劳动力与资本的替代而间接的。",
