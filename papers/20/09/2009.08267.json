    "translated_abstract": "物理系统的预测通常依赖于从模拟集合中获得的知识，例如生物科学中的细胞集合。为了定性和定量分析，这些集合使用参数化的机械模型（MM）进行模拟。基于贝叶斯推断和模型族方法是目前物理系统参数估计的两类主流方法。然而，在贝叶斯分析中，对MM参数使用无信息先验会引入不可取的偏差。在这里，我们提出了如何在随机逆问题（SIP）框架中推断参数，该框架也被称为数据一致反演，其中先验只关注由于MM不可逆造成的不确定性。为了演示，我们引入了基于拒绝采样、马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛和生成对抗网络（GANs）的新方法来解决SIP。此外，为了克服SIP的局限性，我们基于约束优化和预",

The methods address the bias introduced by uninformative priors in Bayesian analysis and infer parameters within the framework of stochastic inverse problems. New methods, including rejection sampling, Markov chain Monte Carlo, and generative adversarial networks, are introduced to overcome the limitations of data-consistent inversion. Additionally, results are further optimized through constrained optimization and prior inverse problem analysis."
