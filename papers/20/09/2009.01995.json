    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个通用框架，用于检验异质因果效应模型中的工具有效性。这个推广包括了治疗可以是多值有序或无序的情况。基于一系列可检验的推论，我们提出了一个非参数检验，被证明具有渐进的尺寸控制和一致性。与文献中的检验相比，我们的检验可以在更普遍的情况下应用，并且可能实现了功率提升。检验过程中的工具无效有助于检测可能导致因果效应不合理的无效工具。通过模拟提供了测试在有限样本上表现良好的证据。我们重新审视了对于学校回报率的实证研究，以展示所提出的检验在实践中的应用。同时，我们提供了一个扩展的连续映射定理和扩展的 delta 方法，这可能是独立的感兴趣的研究内容，来建立测试统计量的渐近分布。",
