    "abstract": "Motivated by the pressing need for suicide prevention through improving behavioral healthcare, we use medical claims data to study the risk of subsequent suicide attempts for patients who were hospitalized due to suicide attempts and later discharged. Understanding the risk behaviors of such patients at elevated suicide risk is an important step toward the goal of \"Zero Suicide.\" An immediate and unconventional challenge is that the identification of suicide attempts from medical claims contains substantial uncertainty: almost 20% of \"suspected\" suicide attempts are identified from diagnosis codes indicating external causes of injury and poisoning with undermined intent. It is thus of great interest to learn which of these undetermined events are more likely actual suicide attempts and how to properly utilize them in survival analysis with severe censoring. To tackle these interrelated problems, we develop an integrative Cox cure model with regularization to perform survival regression",

    "translated_abstract": "在通过改善行为保健实现自杀预防的迫切需求的驱使下，我们使用医疗索赔数据研究了因自杀未遂而住院并后来出院的患者随后的自杀未遂风险。了解这些患者在升高的自杀风险下的风险行为是实现“零自杀”的目标的重要一步。一个即时且非常规的挑战是，从医疗索赔中识别自杀未遂包含重大的不确定性：几乎有20％的“疑似”自杀未遂是从表明外部原因所致损伤和中毒的诊断编码中确定的。因此，了解这些未确定事件中哪些更有可能是实际的自杀未遂事件以及如何在严重的截尾生存分析中正确地利用它们是非常有趣的。为了解决这些相关问题，我们开发了一种具有正则化的综合Cox淘汰模型来执行生存回归。",
