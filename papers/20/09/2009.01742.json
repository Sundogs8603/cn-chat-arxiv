    "translated_abstract": "网络建模的一个共同目标是揭示节点之间的潜在社区结构。对于许多现实世界中的网络，真实的连接都由作为流到达的事件组成，然后将其聚合形成边缘，忽略了动态的时间组件。考虑到这些交互的时间动态的一种自然方法是使用点过程作为网络模型中的基础进行社区检测。计算复杂性影响着这种方法在大型稀疏网络上的可扩展性。为了克服这一挑战，我们提出了一种快速在线变分推断算法，用于估计网络上基于动态事件到达的潜在结构，使用连续时间点过程潜在网络模型。我们描述了适用于捕捉社区结构的网络模型的此过程。当在网络上观察到新事件时，可以学习该结构，并更新推断的社区分配。我们研究了这种方法的理论性质。",
