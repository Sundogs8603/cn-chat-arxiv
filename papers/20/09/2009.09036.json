    "translated_abstract": "在健康和社会科学中，确定研究人群中存在明显的治疗效应异质性(HTE)的亚群是至关重要的。由于其高度可解释性，决策树已被提出并广泛应用于数据驱动的HTE发现。然而，单一决策树发现HTE可能不稳定且过于简化。本文介绍了一种新的HTE发现和估计方法——因果规则集合(CRE)，采用集成树方法。CRE具有以下几个关键特点: 1) 可解释的HTE表示; 2) 探索复杂的异质性模式的能力; 3) 在亚群发现中具有高稳定性。所发现的亚群是通过可解释的决策规则定义的。亚群特定因果效应的估计通过两阶段方法进行，我们提供了理论保证。通过模拟实验证明，CRE方法是可行的。",
