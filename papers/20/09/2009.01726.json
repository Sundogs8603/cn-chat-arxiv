However, a necessary condition is the unambiguous knowledge of whether each individual is censored or not, which may be incomplete in practice. We therefore propose a study of the Beran estimator when the censoring indicators are generic random variables and discuss necessary conditions for the efficiency of the Beran estimator. From this, we provide a new estimator for the conditional survival function with missing not at random (MNAR) censoring indicators based on a conditional copula model for the missingness mechanism. In addition to the theoretical results, we illustrate how the estimators work for small samples through a simulation study and show their practical applicability by analyzing synthetic and real data.",

    "translated_abstract": "在具有协变量的右截尾数据中，条件Kaplan-Meier估计器（也称为Beran估计器）一致估计感兴趣事件的随机追踪的条件生存函数。然而，必要条件是对每个个体是否被截尾有明确的了解，而在实践中可能是不完整的。因此，我们提出了当截尾指标是一般随机变量时对Beran估计器进行研究，并讨论了Beran估计器效率的必要条件。基于缺失非随机（MNAR）截尾指标的条件Copula模型，我们提供了一种新的条件生存函数估计器。除了理论结果，我们通过模拟研究对小样本中的估计器进行了演示，并通过分析合成和真实数据展示了它们的实际适用性。",
