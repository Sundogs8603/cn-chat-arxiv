    "abstract": "We propose Monte Carlo calibration algorithms for three models: local volatility with stochastic interest rates, stochastic local volatility with deterministic interest rates, and finally stochastic local volatility with stochastic interest rates. For each model, we include detailed derivations of the corresponding SDE systems, and list the required input data and steps for calibration. We give conditions under which a local volatility can exist given European option prices, stochastic interest rate model parameters, and correlations. The models are posed in a foreign exchange setting. The drift term for the exchange rate is given as a difference of two stochastic short rates, domestic and foreign, each modeled by a G1++ process. For stochastic volatility, we model the variance for the exchange rate by a CIR process. We include tests to show the convergence and the accuracy of the proposed algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了三种模型的Monte Carlo校准算法：具有随机利率的本地波动率，具有确定性利率的随机本地波动率，以及具有随机利率的随机本地波动率。对于每个模型，我们包括相应SDE系统的详细推导，并列出了校准所需的输入数据和步骤。我们给出了在给定欧式期权价格，随机利率模型参数和相关性的情况下，本地波动率可以存在的条件。模型是在外汇交易中设定的。汇率的漂移项给出为两个随机短期利率（国内和外国），每个利率由G1++过程建模。对于随机波动率，我们通过CIR过程模拟交换汇率的方差。我们包括测试以显示所提出的算法的收敛性和准确性。",
