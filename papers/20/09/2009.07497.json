    "translated_abstract": "逻辑遗忘即使在命题Horn公式的简单情况下也是p完全的，可能会指数级增加其大小。一种遗忘的方式是用包含变量要遗忘的每个子句替换它们的头部变量。在单头的情况下，这需要多项式时间：每个变量最多是一个子句的头部。有些公式不是单头的，但可以通过简化来实现。它们是单头等价的。本文的第一项贡献是对单头等价性进行语义特征化的研究。给出了两个必要条件。当公式不等价时，它们是充分条件：它只会使两个变量集等价，如果它们也等价于它们的交集。所有非循环公式都是不等价的。本文的第二个贡献是一个用于将公式转换为单头的不完全算法。如果成功，遗忘将能够在多项式时间内进行，并产生一个多项式大小的公式。",
