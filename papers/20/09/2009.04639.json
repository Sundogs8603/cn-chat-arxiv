    "translated_abstract": "指代消解中的主要挑战之一是如何利用在提及集群上定义的实体级特征，而不是提及对。然而，具有共同指代的提及通常在整个文本中分散，这使得整合实体级特征极其困难。我们提出了一种基于图神经网络的指代消解方法，通过鼓励在可能指向同一真实世界实体的所有提及之间共享特征来捕捉实体为中心的信息。通过边将提及彼此链接起来，建模两个链接提及指向相同实体的可能性。通过这样的图形建模，提及之间的特征可以通过实体为中心的信息传递操作进行共享。还提出了一种基于二阶特征的全局推理算法，将提及最优地聚类到一致的组中。实验结果显示，我们基于图神经网络的方法结合二阶特征的效果很好。",
