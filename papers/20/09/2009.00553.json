    "translated_abstract": "当研究人员将多个工具变量组合用于单一二元治疗时，本地平均治疗效应（LATE）框架的单调性假设可能变得过于限制性：它要求所有单位在分别改变工具变量方向时具有相同的反应方向。相比之下，我所称的向量单调性仅仅假设所有工具变量的治疗接受程度是单调的，它是Mogstad等人引入的部分单调性假设的特殊情况。在工具变量为二元变量时，我刻画了在向量单调性下被点识别的因果参数类。该类包括对任何一种方式对工具变量集合做出响应的单位的平均治疗效应，或对给定子集做出响应的单位的平均治疗效应。识别结果是建设性的，并提供了对已识别的治疗效应参数的简单估计器。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了向量单调性假设的观点，该假设对于多个工具变量组合的研究具有重要意义。通过假设所有工具变量的治疗接受程度是单调的，我们可以得到一些因果参数的点识别，并提供了相应的估计方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes the concept of vector monotonicity, which is important for the study of combining multiple instrumental variables. By assuming the monotonicity of treatment uptake in all instruments, we can achieve point identification of certain causal parameters and provide corresponding estimation methods."
