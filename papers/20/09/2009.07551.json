Furthermore, we provide the first auxiliary assumption of McCrary's (2008) diagnostic test to detect manipulation. Based on our auxiliary assumption, we derive a novel expression of moments that immediately implies the worst-case bounds of Gerard, Rokkanen, and Rothe (2020) and an enhanced interpretation of their target parameters. We highlight two issues: an overlooked source of identification failure, and a missing auxiliary assumption to detect manipulation. In the case studies, we illustrate our solution to these issues using institutional details and economic theories.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种回归不连续设计的新的识别条件。我们将Lee（2008）的局部随机化替换为其威胁的两个限制，即，操纵运行变量。此外，我们提供了McCrary（2008）诊断测试的第一个辅助假设来检测操纵。根据我们的辅助假设，我们推导出一种新颖的矩阵表达式，立即得出了Gerard、Rokkanen和Rothe（2020）的最坏情况界限，并增强了对目标参数的解释。我们强调了两个问题：一个被忽视的识别失败的来源，以及一个缺失的检测操纵的辅助假设。在案例研究中，我们利用制度细节和经济理论来说明我们解决这些问题的方法。",

Through case studies, we demonstrate the application of our method in practical situations."
