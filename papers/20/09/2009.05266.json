    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了Graph Temporal Edge Aggregation (GTEA)框架，用于在时序交互图（TIGs）上进行归纳学习。不同于以往工作，GTEA将交互序列的时间动态建模在连续时间空间中，并同时利用图中丰富的节点和边/交互属性。具体来说，我们将序列模型与时间编码器相结合，学习相邻节点之间的成对交互动力学。这有助于捕捉节点对沿历史的复杂时间交互模式，生成边嵌入可以输入到GNN骨干。通过聚合相邻节点和相应的边嵌入的特征，GTEA共同学习TIG的拓扑和时间依赖关系。此外，还采用了一种稀疏感知自注意机制进行邻居聚合，突出更重要的邻居并抑制GTEA的琐碎噪声。通过联合优化整个框架，我们验证了其在多个时间序列预测任务中的有效性。",
