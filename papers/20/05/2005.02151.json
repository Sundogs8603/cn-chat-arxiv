    "translated_abstract": "顶点提名是一项轻度监督的网络信息检索任务，在这个任务中，感兴趣的一张图的顶点被用来查询第二张图以发现感兴趣的第二张图的顶点。与其他信息检索任务类似，顶点提名方案的输出是第二张图中顶点的排序列表，理想情况下，未知的感兴趣的顶点应该集中在列表的顶部。顶点提名方案为高效地挖掘复杂网络中的相关信息提供了有用的工具。在本文中，我们从理论和实践两方面探讨了内容（即边缘和顶点属性）和上下文（即网络拓扑结构）在顶点提名中的双重作用。我们提供了必要和充分的条件，证明了利用内容和上下文的顶点提名方案能够超越仅利用内容或上下文的方案。虽然内容和上下文的联合效用在其他网络分析任务中已经得到证实，但我们证明在顶点提名的背景下，这种联合效用也是成立的。此外，我们提出了一种新颖的基于内容感知的网络嵌入方法，用于顶点提名，可以有效地结合局部和全局网络属性信息。我们在真实的社交和引用网络上进行了实验，证明了我们提出的方法优于不利用内容和上下文的现有的顶点提名方法。",
