    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了带有假定结构的高阶聚类的统计和计算限制。我们关注两种聚类模型，常数高阶聚类（CHC）和秩一高阶聚类（ROHC），并研究了测试聚类存在性（检测）和识别聚类支持（恢复）的方法和理论。具体而言，我们确定了当信噪比处于某些临界值时，CHC和ROHC的检测/恢复是统计上可能的。我们还发展了紧密的计算阈值：当信噪比低于这些阈值时，我们证明在超图种植团问题（HPC）检测和超图种植稠密子图（HPDS）恢复的计算困难猜想下，多项式时间算法无法解决这些问题。此外，我们提出了多项式时间的张量算法，在信噪比高于这些阈值时实现可靠的检测和恢复。同时，我们还研究了稀疏性和...",
