    "abstract": "The era of technological change entails complex patterns of changes in wages and employment. We develop a unified framework to measure the contribution of technological change embodied in new capital to changes in the relative wages and income shares of different types of labor. We obtain the aggregate elasticities of substitution by estimating and aggregating sectoral production function parameters with cross-country and cross-industry panel data from OECD countries. We show that advances in information, communication, and computation technologies contribute significantly to narrowing the gender wage gap, widening the skill wage gap, and declining labor shares.",
