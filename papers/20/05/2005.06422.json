FluidGAN is thoroughly data-driven with high speed and accuracy and satisfies the physics of fluid without any prior knowledge of underlying fluid and energy transport physics.

Our framework helps understand deterministic multiphysics phenomena where the underlying physical model is complex or unknown.",
