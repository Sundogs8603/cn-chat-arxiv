    "translated_abstract": "时变参数（TVP）回归模型可能涉及大量系数。需要仔细的先验探询，以得出合理的后验和预测推论。此外，马尔科夫链蒙特卡罗（MCMC）方法的计算需求意味着仅在预测变量数不太多的情况下使用。鉴于这两个问题，本文提出了一种新的动态收缩先验，反映了TVP通常是稀疏的经验规律（即时间变化可能仅偶尔发生，并且仅涉及某些系数）。开发了一种可扩展的MCMC算法，能够处理非常高维度的TVP回归或TVP向量自回归。在使用人造数据进行的一项练习中，我们展示了我们的方法的准确性和计算效率。在涉及欧元区利率期限结构的应用中，我们发现我们的动态收缩先验可以有效挑选出少量的时间变化系数。",
