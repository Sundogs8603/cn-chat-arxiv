The asset prices are assumed to follow a nonlinear price curve quoted in the market as the utility indifference curve of a representative liquidity supplier. We show that optimality can be fully characterized via a system of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) which corresponds to a non-linear backward stochastic partial differential equation (BSPDE). We show existence of solutions to the optimal investment problem and the FBSDEs in the case where the driver function of the representative market maker grows at least quadratically or the utility function of the large investor falls faster than quadratically or is exponential.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在具有内生持久市场影响的不完全金融市场中，一位大型投资者的预期效用最大化问题。假设资产价格遵循市场上代表性流动性供应商的效用不变曲线作为非线性价格曲线。我们通过一组耦合的前向-后向随机微分方程（FBSDEs）完全描述出最优性，该方程组对应非线性反向随机偏微分方程（BSPDE）。在市场代表性市场制造商的驱动函数至少呈二次增长或大型投资者的效用函数下降得比二次更快或呈指数形式的情况下，我们证明了最优投资问题和FBSDEs的解的存在性。此外，我们推导出BSPDEs解存在的光滑性结果。文中提供了完全市场情况下的示例。",
