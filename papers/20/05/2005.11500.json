    "abstract": "We study the stochastic dynamics of renewable resources under the threat of ecological regime shifts. We establish a Pareto optimal framework of regime shift detection under uncertainty that minimizes the delay with which economic agents become aware of the shift. We integrate ecosystem surveillance in the formation of optimal resource extraction policies. We fully solve the case of a profit-maximizing monopolist and provide the conditions that determine whether an adverse regime shift can lead to an aggressive or a precautionary extraction policy, depending on the interaction between market demand, resource scarcity and detection time. We apply our framework to the case of the Cantareira water reservoir in S\\~ao Paulo, Brazil, and study the events that led to its depletion and the consequent water supply crisis.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了面临生态体制转变威胁下的可再生资源的随机动态。我们建立了一个帕累托最优的不确定性下的生态体制转变检测框架，该框架最小化了经济主体意识到转变的延迟。我们将生态系统监测与最优资源提取政策的制定相结合。我们完整解决了一个以利润最大化为目标的垄断主义者，并提供了决定不利生态体制转变是否会导致积极或谨慎采取资源提取策略的条件，这取决于市场需求、资源稀缺和检测时间之间的交互作用。我们将我们的框架应用于巴西圣保罗的Cantareira水库案例，并研究导致其枯竭和随后的供水危机的事件。",
