The categorical part of the semantics is a monoidal biclosed category with a coalgebra modality, very similar to the structure of a Differential Category. We instantiate this category to finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps via \"quantisation\" functors and work with three concrete interpretations of the coalgebra modality. We apply the model to construct categorical and concrete semantic interpretations for the motivating example of !L*: the derivation of a phrase with a parasitic gap. The effectiveness of the concrete interpretations are evaluated via a disambiguation task, on an extension of a sentence disambiguation dataset to parasitic gap phrases, using BERT, Word2Vec, and FastText vectors and Relational tensors.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们为具有有限压缩和置换规则的相关模态! L *的Lambek演算开发了一种范畴组合分布语义学。语义学的范畴部分是一个具有余代数模态的一般双闭范畴，非常类似于微分范畴的结构。我们通过“量子化”函子将这个范畴实例化为有限维向量空间和线性映射，并利用三种具体的余代数模态来进行操作。我们将该模型应用于构建相关模态! L *的一个示例中：具有寄生代的短语派生。使用BERT、Word2Vec和FastText向量以及关系张量，我们对具体解释的有效性进行了评估，通过对扩展了的句子消岐数据集上的寄生代短语进行任务处理。",
