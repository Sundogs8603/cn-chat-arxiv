    "translated_abstract": "虽然反馈回路在许多复杂系统中起着重要作用，但在大部分因果推断文献中忽视了它们的存在，因为通常假设系统从一开始就是非循环的。当将为非循环环境设计的因果推断算法应用于涉及反馈的系统生成的数据时，我们不会期望得到正确的结果。本研究表明，出人意料的是，快速因果推断（FCI）算法在应用于涉及反馈的系统生成的观察数据时的输出是正确的。具体而言，我们证明了对于由简单且$\\sigma$-可信结构性因果模型（SCM）生成的观察数据，FCI是可靠而完整的，并且可以用于一致地估计：（i）因果关系的存在和缺失，（ii）直接因果关系的存在和缺失，（iii）混淆因素的缺失，以及（iv）因果图中特定循环的缺失。",
