    "translated_abstract": "文档分类是将主题标签分配给每个文档的基本任务，在各种应用程序中起着重要作用。尽管现有的传统监督文档分类研究取得了成功，但它们较少关注两个实际问题：（1）存在元数据：在许多领域，文本伴随着各种附加信息，例如作者和标签。这些元数据作为有力的主题指示器，应该被利用到分类框架中；（2）标签稀缺：在某些情况下，获得有标签的训练样本是昂贵的，需要只使用少量注释数据进行分类。鉴于这两个挑战，我们提出了MetaCat，一种使用元数据进行最小监督文本分类的框架。具体而言，我们开发了一个生成模型来描述单词、文档、标签和元数据之间的关系。根据生成模型的指导，我们将文本和元数据嵌入到分类框架中。",
