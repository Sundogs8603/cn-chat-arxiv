In this work, we consider statistical models where the data distributions can be characterized by continuous parameters. We show that under certain conditions on the distribution, unlabeled data is equally useful as labeled date in terms of learning rate. Specifically, let $n, m$ be the number of labeled and unlabeled data, respectively. It is shown that the learning rate of semi-supervised learning scales as $O(1/n)$ if $m\\sim n$, and scales as $O(1/n^{1+\\gamma})$ if $m\\sim n^{1+\\gamma}$ for some $\\gamma>0$, whereas the learning rate of supervised learning scales as $O(1/n)$.",

    "translated_abstract": "半监督学习算法试图利用较便宜的未标记数据来提高学习性能。本文考虑了数据分布可以由连续参数来描述的统计模型。我们展示了在分布满足一定条件的情况下，未标记数据在学习速度方面与标记数据同样有用。具体而言，设$n，m$分别为标记和未标记数据的数量。研究表明，如果$m\\sim n$，半监督学习的学习速度按$O(1/n)$缩放；如果$m\\sim n^{1+\\gamma}$，半监督学习的学习速度按$O(1/n^{1+\\gamma})$缩放，其中$\\gamma>0$，而监督学习的学习速度按$O(1/n)$缩放。",
