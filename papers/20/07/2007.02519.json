    "translated_abstract": "现代机器学习方法在训练数据是IID、大规模和标记充分时表现优异，而在不理想的条件下学习仍然是一个开放的挑战。少样本、持续、转移和表示学习的子领域在在不良条件下的学习方面取得了长足的进步，每个子领域通过不同的方法和洞见具有独特的优势。这些方法解决了不同的挑战，如数据按顺序到达或训练示例有限，然而，在部署之前往往无法预见ML系统在其生命周期内将面临的困难条件。因此，需要能够处理学习实际设置中众多挑战的通用ML系统。为了促进通用ML方法的研究，我们引入了一种新的统一评估框架——FLUID（灵活序列数据）。FLUID整合了少样本、持续、转移和表示学习的目标，同时实现了这些子领域技术的比较和整合。它支持顺序数据、在线评估和超出分布评估，同时允许评估不同的语态、任务和领域。我们使用几个案例研究展示了FLUID的多功能性，并讨论了其使用的未来方向。",
