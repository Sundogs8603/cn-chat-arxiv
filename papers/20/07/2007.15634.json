    "translated_abstract": "异常是指数据集中以某种方式不寻常且不符合一般模式的事件。异常的概念通常没有明确定义，并被认为是模糊的和依赖于具体领域的。此外，尽管在这个主题上已有约250年的出版物，但迄今尚未发表过关于不同类型的异常的综合和具体概述。通过广泛文献综述，本研究因此提供了第一个理论上基于原则且领域无关的数据异常分类法，并呈现了异常类型和子类型的全面概述。为了明确定义异常的概念及其不同的表现，该分类法运用了五个维度：数据类型、关系的基数、异常级别、数据结构和数据分布。这些基本且以数据为中心的维度自然地产生了3个大组、9种基本类型和63个异常子类型。该分类法有助于评估某个数据处理系统对异常的功能能力。",
