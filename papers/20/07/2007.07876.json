    "translated_abstract": "乐观原则面对不确定性是多臂赌博和强化学习中最广泛使用和成功的理念之一。然而，现有的乐观算法（主要是UCB及其变种）通常无法处理一般的函数类和大的上下文空间。本文研究了具有离线回归预言机的一般上下文赌博，并提出了一种简单的通用原则来设计乐观算法，称为“上限反事实置信区间”（UCCB）。UCCB的关键创新是在策略空间中建立置信区间，而不是像UCB那样在行动空间中。我们证明了这些算法在处理一般函数类和大上下文空间方面既是可证明的最优的，又在计算上是高效的。此外，我们证明了UCCB原则可以轻松地扩展到无限动作的一般上下文赌博，并提供了第一个解决方案。",
