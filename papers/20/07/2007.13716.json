    "translated_abstract": "套索方法是一种高维回归方法，当自变量的数量$p$与观测数量$n$相同或更大时，现在通常使用。由于两个基本原因，经典的渐近正态理论不适用于该模型：(1) 正则化风险是非光滑的；(2) 估计器$\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$与真实参数向量$\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^*$之间的距离不能忽略。因此，传统的渐近正态理论的基础——标准的摄动论证失败。另一方面，在$n$和$p$都很大且$n/p$为1阶的情况下，可以精确地描述套索估计器。这个描述首先是在具有独立同分布自变量的高斯设计情况下得到的：我们将其推广到具有非奇异协方差结构的高斯相关设计。这可以通过一个更简单的“固定设计”模型来表达。",
