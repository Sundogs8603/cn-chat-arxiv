    "abstract": "Sampling schemes are fundamental tools in statistics, survey design, and algorithm design. A fundamental result in differential privacy is that a differentially private mechanism run on a simple random sample of a population provides stronger privacy guarantees than the same algorithm run on the entire population. However, in practice, sampling designs are often more complex than the simple, data-independent sampling schemes that are addressed in prior work. In this work, we extend the study of privacy amplification results to more complex, data-dependent sampling schemes. We find that not only do these sampling schemes often fail to amplify privacy, they can actually result in privacy degradation. We analyze the privacy implications of the pervasive cluster sampling and stratified sampling paradigms, as well as provide some insight into the study of more general sampling designs.",

    "translated_abstract": "抽样方案是统计学、调查设计和算法设计中的基本工具。在差分隐私中的一个基本结果是，对于一个人群的简单随机样本运行的差异私密机制比对整个人群运行相同算法提供更强的隐私保证。然而，在实践中，抽样设计往往比在先前的工作中所涉及到的简单的独立于数据的抽样方案更加复杂。在本文中，我们将隐私扩大结果的研究扩展到更复杂的依赖于数据的抽样方案。我们发现，这些抽样方案不仅通常无法扩大隐私，而且可能会导致隐私损害。我们分析了流行的聚类抽样和分层抽样范例的隐私影响，同时为更普遍的抽样设计的研究提供了一些见解。",
