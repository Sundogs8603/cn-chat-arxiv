    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种具有灵活类成员组件的半非参数潜在类选择模型(LCCM)。该模型利用混合模型来描述潜在的类别，作为传统随机效用模型的替代方法，旨在比较这两种方法在预测准确性和选择过程中异质性表示等多个指标上的表现。混合模型是一种基于参数的模型聚类技术，在机器学习、数据挖掘和模式识别等领域广泛应用于聚类和分类问题。我们推导出了一种基于期望最大化(EM)算法的估计方法用于该模型。通过两个不同的出行方式选择行为的案例研究，将该模型与传统离散选择模型进行了比较，分析参数估计的符号、时间价值、统计拟合度量和交叉验证测试等指标。结果表明，混合模型在多个指标上相比传统选择模型具有更好的表现。",
