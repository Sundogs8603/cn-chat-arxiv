    "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework to analyze an agent who misinterprets or misperceives the true decision problem she faces. We show that a wide range of behavior observed in experimental settings manifest as failures to perceive implications, in other words, to properly account for the logical relationships between various payoff relevant contingencies. We present a behavioral definition of perceived implication, thereby providing an elicitation technique, and show that an agent's account of implication identifies a subjective state-space that underlies her behavior. By analyzing this state-space, we characterize distinct benchmarks of logical sophistication that drive empirical phenomena. We disentangle static and dynamic rationality. Thus, our framework delivers both a methodology for assessing an agent's level of contingent thinking and a strategy for identifying her beliefs in the absence full rationality.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提供了一个理论框架来分析一个错误解读或错误感知真实决策问题的智能体。我们展示了一系列行为在实验环境中观察到的表现为无法理解含义，换句话说，无法正确考虑各种与关键支付相关的情况之间的逻辑关系。我们提出了对感知因果关系的行为定义，从而提供了一种引导技术，并展示了一个智能体对因果关系的解释确定了其行为的主观状态空间。通过分析这个状态空间，我们描述了驱动经验现象的逻辑复杂性的不同基准。我们区分了静态和动态的理性。因此，我们的框架既提供了评估智能体因果思维水平的方法，又提供了在没有完全理性的情况下识别其信念的策略。",
