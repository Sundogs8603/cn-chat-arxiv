    "translated_abstract": "冠状病毒（或COVID-19）是一种危险的疾病，通过直接影响肺部危及全球许多人的健康。COVID-19是一种中等大小、有包被的病毒，具有单链RNA，同时也拥有最大的RNA基因组之一，大约120纳米。X射线和计算机断层扫描（CT）成像方法被广泛用于快速准确的医学诊断。从这些医学图像中识别COVID-19非常具有挑战性，因为它耗时且容易出现人为错误。因此，可以使用人工智能（AI）方法来获得一致的高性能。在AI方法中，与传统的机器学习（ML）相比，深度学习（DL）网络最近变得越来越受欢迎。与ML不同，DL模型可以自动完成特征提取、特征选择和分类的所有阶段。本文全面调查了关于使用DL技术进行COVID-19诊断和预测的研究。",
