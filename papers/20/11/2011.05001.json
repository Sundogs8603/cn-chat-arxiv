    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了非平衡最优输运（UOT）问题，其中使用最大平均偏差（MMD）正则化来实现边际约束。我们的研究动机在于观察到，现有的UOT研究主要关注基于$\\phi$-散度（例如KL）的正则化。MMD作为互补的积分概率度量（IPM）家族之一，在UOT上的作用似乎不太被理解。我们的主要结果基于Fenchel对偶性，利用它我们能够研究MMD正则化的UOT（MMD-UOT）的特性。这种对偶结果的一个有趣结果是MMD-UOT诱导了一种新的度量方法，也属于IPM家族。此外，我们提出了基于有限样本的凸规划，用于估算MMD-UOT和相应的重心。在温和的条件下，我们证明了我们基于凸规划的估计量是一致的，而且估计误差以$\\mathcal{O}(m^{-1/2})$的速率衰减。",
