    "translated_abstract": "本文针对四足机器人在嘈杂环境中跳跃不同距离和高度的一般任务进行了研究，如不平坦地形和可变机器人动力学参数。为了在这样的条件下准确跳跃，我们提出了一种利用深度强化学习的框架，该框架借鉴并增强了四足跳跃的非线性轨迹优化的复杂解决方案。与独立优化方法相比，该方法不仅限制了跳跃起跳点必须在平坦地面上，还要求准确的机器人动力学假设。我们的方法改进了对极不平坦地形和可变机器人动力学参数以及环境条件的跳跃鲁棒性。与行走和奔跑相比，在硬件上实现积极跳跃需要考虑电机的扭矩-速度关系以及机器人的总功率限制。通过将这些约束条件纳入我们的学习框架中，我们成功地部署了我们的方法。",
