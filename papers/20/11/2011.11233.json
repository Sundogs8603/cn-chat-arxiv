    "translated_abstract": "尽管可微架构搜索（DARTS）是一种流行的架构搜索方法，但由于整个超网络存放在内存中，它受到了严重的内存开销的限制。这就是单路径DARTS的优势所在，它在每个步骤中只选择一个单路径子模型。虽然它对内存友好，但计算成本较低。然而，我们发现单路径DARTS存在一个关键问题，这一问题尚未得到足够的关注。也就是说，它也会出现严重的性能下降，因为像DARTS一样，它会导出太多无参数操作，例如跳跃连接。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为ROME的新算法来解决这个问题。首先，我们通过拓扑搜索和操作搜索解耦，使搜索和评估保持一致。然后，我们采用Gumbel-Top2重新参数化和梯度累积来增强具有挑战性的双层优化。我们对ROME进行了大量验证。",
