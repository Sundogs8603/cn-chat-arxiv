    "translated_abstract": "图形模型是估计高维逆协方差（精度）矩阵的强大工具，已应用于投资组合分配问题。这些模型所做的假设是精度矩阵的稀疏性。然而，当股票收益被共同因素驱动时，这种假设不成立。我们解决了这个限制，并开发了一个框架，称为因子图形Lasso（FGL），在投资组合分配的背景下将图形模型与因子结构相结合，通过将精度矩阵分解成低秩和稀疏分量。我们的理论结果和模拟表明，FGL consistently估计投资组合权重和风险敞口，并且FGL对于重尾分布是健壮的，这使得我们的方法适用于金融应用。实证应用中，FGL基于的投资组合表现优于几个显着的竞争对手，包括等权和指数投资组合。",
