    "translated_abstract": "我们通过强化学习（RL）来研究人工智能（AI）如何学习控制Acrobot。我们设计了一个嵌入式系统作为实验装置，该系统对机器人和能源收集应用具有重要意义。具体地，我们研究了控制Acrobot角速度以及其总能量（即动能和势能之和）。通过RL算法，我们能够将Acrobot的第一个摆杆的角速度或能量驱动到期望值，从而实现Acrobot未驱动摆杆的摇摆或完全旋转。此外，我们进行了Acrobot控制的研究，通过这些研究我们对状态空间离散化、回合长度、动作空间以及驱动摆杆质量对RL控制的影响有了更深入的了解。通过更多的模拟和实验，我们还研究了参数的效应。",
