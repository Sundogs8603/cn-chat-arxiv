    "translated_abstract": "由于同时进行的脑电图-功能磁共振成像（EEG-fMRI）的高时间和空间分辨率的优势，该技术吸引了广泛的关注，并被广泛应用于脑科学的各个研究领域。然而，在脑部的功能磁共振成像过程中，心动揭示现象（BCG）会严重污染脑电图（EEG）。作为一个非配对问题，BCG揭示现象的去除仍然是一个相当大的挑战。为了提供解决方案，本文提出了一种新颖的模块化生成对抗网络（GAN）及相应的训练策略，通过优化每个模块的参数来改进网络性能。通过这种方式，我们希望提高网络模型的局部表示能力，从而改善其整体性能，并获得一个可靠的用于去除BCG揭示现象的生成器。此外，所提出的方法不依赖于额外的参考信号或复杂的硬件设备。",
