    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了连续条件生成对抗网络（CcGAN），这是首个用于基于连续标量条件（称为回归标签）的图像生成的生成模型。现有的条件GAN（cGAN）主要设计用于分类条件（例如类标签）；对于回归标签的条件生成则在数学上有所不同，引发了两个基本问题：（P1）由于某些回归标签可能没有真实图像，最小化现有的经验cGAN损失（也称为经验cGAN损失）在实践中通常不起作用；（P2）由于回归标签是连续的且无限多，传统的标签输入方法不适用。所提出的CcGAN通过分别（S1）重新构建现有的经验cGAN损失以适应连续场景；以及（S2）提出一种简单的标签输入（NLI）方法和一种改进的标签输入（ILI）方法将回归标签融入模型，解决了上述问题。",
