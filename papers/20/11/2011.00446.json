    "translated_abstract": "跳跃是四足动物在克服障碍物时非常重要的步态之一。作者提出了一种有效的方法，可以更高效地学习鲁棒的跳跃步态，尽管其动态身体运动变化较大。作者首先利用传统的基于模型的控制器从机器人的数据中预训练神经网络，然后通过深度强化学习进一步优化预训练的神经网络。特别地，作者设计了一个考虑接触点和阶段的奖励函数，以强制跳跃步态的对称性和周期性，从而改善跳跃性能。基于神经网络的反馈控制器在仿真中学习，并成功地应用于真实的四足机器人Jueying Mini上。作者的方法在室内外环境中展示了多样化的应用。该方法表现出高效的计算和Jueying Mini四足机器人跳跃超越障碍物的良好行动结果。",
