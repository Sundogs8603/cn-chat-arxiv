Treatment personalization introduces incentives for individuals to modify their behavior to obtain a better treatment. Strategic behavior shifts the joint distribution of covariates and potential outcomes. The optimal rule without strategic behavior allocates treatments only to those with a positive Conditional Average Treatment Effect. With strategic behavior, we show that the optimal rule can involve randomization, allocating treatments with less than 100% probability even to those who respond positively on average to the treatment. We propose a sequential experiment based on Bayesian Optimization that converges to the optimal treatment rule without parametric assumptions on individual strategic behavior.",

    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的人对基于观察到的个体特征的治疗分配产生兴趣，例如定向营销、个性化信用报价和异质性定价等。治疗个性化引入了个体修改其行为以获得更好治疗的激励。战略行为会改变共变量和潜在结果的联合分布。在没有战略行为的情况下，最佳规则将分配治疗对于有积极条件平均治疗效应的个体。而在存在战略行为时，我们发现最佳规则可以涉及随机化，即使是对那些平均上对治疗有积极反应的个体，也可以分配不到100%的治疗机会。我们提出了一个基于贝叶斯优化的顺序实验，它可以在没有个体战略行为参数假设下，收敛到最优治疗分配规则。",
