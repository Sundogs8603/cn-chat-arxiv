    "translated_abstract": "教科书问答（TQA）是一个任务，要求在一个包含大量文章和图表的多模态背景下，回答一个图表/非图表问题。我们认为解释性应该将学生视为一个需要考虑的关键因素。为了解决这个问题，我们设计了一种新的架构，通过我们提出的从粗到细的算法，实现了对TQA的跨句解释（XTQA），该算法可以为学生提供不仅是答案，还包括用于选择答案的跨句证据。该算法首先使用TF-IDF方法粗略地选择与问题相关的前M个段落，然后从这些段落中的所有候选跨句中精细地选择前K个证据跨句，通过计算每个跨句对问题的信息增益。实验结果表明，与基线方法相比，XTQA显著提高了最先进的性能。源代码可在https://github.com/keep-smile-001/opentqa获取。",
