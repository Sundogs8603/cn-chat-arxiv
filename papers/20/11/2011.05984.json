    "translated_abstract": "以相关性结构的相似性为基础，以往的研究探索了金融市场的各种条件，并将其分类为市场状态。我们对这些市场状态的选择标准进行了修改，主要是因为对状态转移矩阵的关注增加了。通过优化两个参数（聚类数和噪声抑制），固定聚类和市场状态，但在相似条件下，我们更倾向于避免状态转移矩阵中的大跳跃的聚类。在对SP 500和日经225市场在COVID-19大流行前的时期进行模型应用时，我们发现了具有统计学意义的结果（2006-2019）。保留20个交易日的时期长度，但将时期的移动减少到单个交易日，我们得到了在相关矩阵空间中的市场轨迹的概念。我们可以将这些状态可视化为二维或三维形式经过尺度变换后的数据。这种方法，对于理解市场状态和风险评估具有重要意义。",
    "tldr": "该论文研究了金融市场的动态和风险评估，并引入了一种新的市场状态选择标准，强调了状态转移矩阵的重要性。在应用于SP 500和日经225市场的实证研究中发现了有统计学意义的结果。这种方法对于理解市场状态和风险评估非常有价值。",

Significant results were found when applying this model to the SP 500 and Nikkei 225 markets. This approach is valuable for understanding market states and risk assessment."
