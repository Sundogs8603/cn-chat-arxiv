    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种基于交易信号奇点的无模型方法，用于分析广泛类别的动态交易策略的风险和收益，包括对冲交易和其他统计套利策略。我们提出了一个数学框架，用于基于离开参考水平的价格奇点描述这些策略的风险分析，在没有任何概率假设的路径设置中。我们引入了delta-奇点的概念，定义为一条路径在偏离一个参考水平后返回到该水平的路径。我们展示了每条连续路径都能以delta-奇点的唯一分解形式表示，这对于动态交易策略的情景分析非常有用，可以得到关于交易次数、实现利润、最大亏损和回撤的简单表达式。我们展示了高频极限，对应于delta趋近于零的情况，由(p-th order)的局部时间决定。",
