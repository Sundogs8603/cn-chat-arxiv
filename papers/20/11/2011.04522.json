    "abstract": "Voxel-based 3D object classification has been thoroughly studied in recent years. Most previous methods convert the classic 2D convolution into a 3D form that will be further applied to objects with binary voxel representation for classification. However, the binary voxel representation is not very effective for 3D convolution in many cases. In this paper, we propose a hybrid cascade architecture for voxel-based 3D object classification. It consists of three stages composed of fully connected and convolutional layers, dealing with easy, moderate, and hard 3D models respectively. Both accuracy and speed can be balanced in our proposed method. By giving each voxel a signed distance value, an obvious gain regarding the accuracy can be observed. Besides, the mean inference time can be speeded up hugely compared with the state-of-the-art point cloud and voxel based methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于体素的三维物体分类已经得到了深入研究。大多数先前的方法将经典的二维卷积转换为三维形式，然后应用于具有二进制体素表示的物体进行分类。然而，在许多情况下，二进制体素表示对于三维卷积来说并不是很有效。在本文中，我们提出了一种用于基于体素的三维物体分类的混合级联体系结构。它由三个阶段组成，包括全连接和卷积层，分别处理易、中和难的三维模型。我们的方法在精度和速度方面都能够达到平衡。通过给每个体素赋予一个有符号的距离值，可以观察到明显的精度提升。此外，与最先进的点云和基于体素的方法相比，平均推理时间可以大大加快。",
