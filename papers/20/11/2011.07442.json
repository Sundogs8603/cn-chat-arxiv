    "translated_abstract": "先前的研究证实，通过用发音的位置和方式特征增强声学特征，语音增强(SE)过程可以指导考虑输入语音的广义语音属性，以获得性能改进。在本文中，我们探索了结构属性的背景信息，作为进一步受益的SE的附加信息。更具体地，我们建议通过利用端到端自动语音识别(E2E-ASR)模型中预测的广义语音类别序列的损失来提高SE性能。我们还开发了多目标训练，利用ASR和感知损失基于基于BPC的E2E-ASR来训练SE系统。来自语音降噪，语音去混响和受损语音增强任务的实验结果表明，上下文BPC信息可以提高SE性能。此外，使用基于BPC的E2E-ASR训练的SE模型胜过了其他基线模型。",
