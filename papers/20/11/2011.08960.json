    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种特别为深度神经网络（DNN）设计的简单而有效的水印算法 Deep Serial Number（DSN）。与传统方法在DNN中引入标识信号不同，我们的方法探索了一种新的DNN知识产权保护机制，有效地阻止了攻击者使用窃取的网络。借鉴序列号在保护传统软件知识产权方面的成功，我们提出了在DNN中实现序列号嵌入的第一个实现。为此，DSN被集成到知识蒸馏框架中，其中首先训练了一个私有的教师DNN。随后，其知识被提炼并传授给一系列定制的学生DNN。每个客户DNN仅在输入有效序列号的情况下才能正确工作。在各种应用中的实验结果证明了DSN在防止未经授权的使用的同时不会损害原始DNN性能的有效性。",
