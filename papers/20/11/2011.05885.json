    "translated_abstract": "在过去十年中，从子采样测量中完成低秩矩阵引起了很多关注。现有的研究表明，为了在一定的概率下理论上确保完成一个$n \\times n$的秩为$r$的带噪声矩阵，需要$\\mathcal{O}(nr\\log^2(n))$个数据，但是需要一些相当苛刻的假设：(1)所含的矩阵必须是不相关的；(2)观测值服从均匀分布。这种限制性部分是由于忽略了杠杆得分和每个元素的预测信息的作用。在本文中，我们使用杠杆得分来描述每个元素的重要性，并显著放宽了假设：(1)对底层低秩矩阵不施加任何其他结构假设；(2)被观测到的元素通过杠杆得分适当地依赖于它们的重要性。在这些假设下，我们设计了一种非均匀/偏倚的采样过程，可以揭示“重要”的元素。",
