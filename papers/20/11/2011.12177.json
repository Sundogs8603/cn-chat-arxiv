    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的算法GOTHIC（图形增强迭代爬山算法），用于检测具有两个或多个密集分离核的星系。我们的目标是在星系中检测双重或多重活动星系核（AGN）的样本。尽管星系合并很常见，但双重AGN的检测很罕见。它们的检测非常重要，因为它们帮助我们理解超大质量黑洞（SMBH）双星的形成、SMBH的增长和多核系统中的AGN反馈效应。因此，需要一种算法对现有的成像数据进行系统调查，以发现双核星系和双重AGN。我们在已知的DNG样本上测试了GOTHIC，并随后将其应用于SDSS DR16中大约100万个处于红移范围0至0.75的星系样本，并具有可用的光谱数据。我们在这个样本中检测到159个双重AGN，其中2个是三重AGN系统。",
