The proposed Conjecturing framework recovers known nonlinear and boolean relationships among features from data. In both settings, true underlying relationships are revealed. We then compare the method to a previously-proposed framework for symbolic regression on the ability to recover equations that are satisfied among features in a dataset. The framework is then applied to patient-level data regarding COVID-19 outcomes to suggest possible risk factors that are confirmed in the medical literature.",
