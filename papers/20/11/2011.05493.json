    "abstract": "Correlated outcomes are common in many practical problems. In some settings, one outcome is of particular interest, and others are auxiliary. To leverage information shared by all the outcomes, traditional multi-task learning (MTL) minimizes an averaged loss function over all the outcomes, which may lead to biased estimation for the target outcome, especially when the MTL model is mis-specified. In this work, based on a decomposition of estimation bias into two types, within-subspace and against-subspace, we develop a robust transfer learning approach to estimating a high-dimensional linear decision rule for the outcome of interest with the presence of auxiliary outcomes. The proposed method includes an MTL step using all outcomes to gain efficiency, and a subsequent calibration step using only the outcome of interest to correct both types of biases. We show that the final estimator can achieve a lower estimation error than the one using only the single outcome of interest. Simulations",

    "translated_abstract": "相关结果在许多实际问题中很常见。在某些情况下，一个结果特别重要，而其他结果是辅助的。为了利用所有结果共享的信息，传统的多任务学习（MTL）最小化了所有结果的平均损失函数，这可能会在MTL模型被错误说明时导致目标结果的估计偏差。基于对估计偏差的分解，我们提出了一种强韧的转移学习方法，用于估计具有辅助结果存在的高维线性决策规则，该方法包括使用所有结果进行MTL步骤以获得效率，以及随后使用仅感兴趣的结果进行校准步骤，以修正两种类型的偏差。我们表明，最终的估计器可以实现比仅使用单个感兴趣结果的估计器具有更低的估计误差。",
