    "translated_abstract": "本文首先提出了一种新颖的算子外推法（OE）来解决确定性变分不等式（VI）问题。类似于梯度（算子）投影法，OE通过在每次迭代中求解单个投影子问题来更新一个搜索序列。我们证明了OE比现有方法更简单地实现了解决各种VI问题的最优收敛速率。然后，我们介绍了随机算子外推（SOE）方法，并建立了其用于解决不同随机VI问题的最优收敛行为。特别地，SOE首次在文献中实现了用于解决基础问题（即随机平滑和强单调VI）的最优复杂度。我们还提出了随机块算子外推（SBOE）方法，以进一步降低应用于具有特定块结构的大规模确定性VI的OE方法的迭代成本。数值实验证明了所提出方法的有效性和效率。",
