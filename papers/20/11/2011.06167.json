In this work, we carry out user studies (1,330 responses from 190 participants) to systematically assess how people with differing levels of expertise respond to different types of predictive uncertainty (i.e., posterior predictive distributions with different shapes and variances) in the context of ML assisted decision making for predicting apartment rental prices. We found that showing posterior predictive distributions led to smaller disagreements with the ML model's predictions, regardless of the shapes and variances of the posterior predictive distributions we considered, and that these effects ",

    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习模型越来越多地用于辅助人类决策，为决策者提供相关输入来帮助他们决定如何将模型预测纳入决策过程，变得至关重要。例如，传达与模型预测相关的不确定性可能在这方面有所帮助。在本研究中，我们进行了用户研究（来自190个参与者的1,330个响应），系统评估了不同类型的预测不确定性（即不同形状和方差的后验预测分布），在预测公寓租金价格的机器学习辅助决策背景下，不同专业水平的人对此进行了如何响应。我们发现，展示后验预测分布可导致与机器学习模型的预测产生更小的分歧，无论我们考虑的后验预测分布的形状和方差如何，而且这些效果...",
