    "abstract": "We consider a model-independent pricing problem in a fixed-income market and show that it leads to a weak optimal transport problem as introduced by Gozlan et al. We use this to characterize the extremal models for the pricing of caplets on the spot rate and to establish a first robust super-replication result that is applicable to fixed-income markets.  Notably, the weak transport problem exhibits a cost function which is non-convex and thus not covered by the standard assumptions of the theory. In an independent section, we establish that weak transport problems for general costs can be reduced to equivalent problems that do satisfy the convexity assumption, extending the scope of weak transport theory. This part could be of its own interest independent of our financial application, and is accessible to readers who are not familiar with mathematical finance notations.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们在固定收益市场中考虑一个无模型依赖的定价问题，并展示它导致了一个由Gozlan等人引入的弱最优传输问题。我们利用这个问题来表征短期利率期权定价的极端模型，并建立了一个首个适用于固定收益市场的强鲁棒超复制结果。值得注意的是，弱最优传输问题展示了一个非凸成本函数，因此不符合理论的标准假设。在一个独立的部分中，我们证明了一般成本的弱最优传输问题可以转化为满足凸性假设的等价问题，扩展了弱传输理论的范围。这部分内容本身可能具有独立的兴趣，不需要读者熟悉数学金融符号。",
