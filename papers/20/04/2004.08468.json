    "translated_abstract": "本文针对个体损失厌恶的情况，发展了理论标准和计量方法，以衡量政策干预的福利排名。我们提出了“损失厌恶敏感占优”的新标准，定义了政策导致的收益和损失分布的弱偏序关系。该标准适用于将个体偏好建模为对结果变化具有非递减和损失厌恶态度的福利函数类别。我们还开发了新的统计方法来实践中测试损失厌恶敏感占优，使用非参数插值估计；这使得推断可以通过一种特殊的重抽样程序进行。由于对政策导致的收益和损失分布的点识别可能需要强假设，我们将比较标准、检验统计量和重抽样程序扩展到部分识别情况。我们通过一个简单的实证应用来说明我们的方法，比较了替代性收入支持的福利情况。",
