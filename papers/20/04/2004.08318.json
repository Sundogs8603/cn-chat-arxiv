    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了根据案例控制和案例群体取样进行因果推断的方法。具体而言，我们关注二元结果和二元治疗的情况，其中感兴趣的参数是通过潜在结果框架定义的因果相对和可归因风险。我们发现强无偏性不总是像随机抽样下那样强大，并且某些单调性假设在锐利识别间隔方面产生可比较的结果。具体而言，通常的比值比在单调治疗反应和单调治疗选择假设下被证明是因果相对风险的锐利识别上界。我们提供了聚合在协变量的真实人口分布上的因果参数推断算法。我们通过研究三个实证例子展示了我们方法的有用性：在巴基斯坦进入著名大学的私立学校受益问题上；在留在学校和放弃学校早期的关系问题上；在预测岗位培训效果问题上。",
