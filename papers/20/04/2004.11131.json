Even though users often care about their digital privacy, they often don't read privacy policies since they require a significant investment in time and effort. Although natural language processing can help in privacy policy understanding, there has been a lack of large scale privacy policy corpora that could be used to analyse, understand, and simplify privacy policies. Thus, we create PrivaSeer, a corpus of over one million English language website privacy policies, which is significantly larger than any previously available corpus. We design a corpus creation pipeline which consists of crawling the web followed by filtering documents using language detection, document classification, duplicate and near-duplication removal, and content extraction. We investigate the composition of the corpus and show results from readability tests, document",

    "translated_abstract": "组织通过在其网站上发布隐私政策来披露其隐私做法。虽然用户通常关心他们的数字隐私，但他们通常不阅读隐私政策，因为这需要大量时间和努力投资。尽管自然语言处理可以帮助理解隐私政策，但以往一直缺乏可用于分析、理解和简化隐私政策的大规模隐私政策语料库。因此，我们创建了PrivaSeer，这是一个包含一百万份英语网站隐私政策的语料库，明显大于以往任何可用的语料库。我们设计了一个语料库创建流程，包括爬取网页，然后使用语言检测、文档分类、重复和近似文档删除以及内容提取进行文档筛选。我们调查了语料库的组成，并展示了阅读能力测试和文档结果。",
