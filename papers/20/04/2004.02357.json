While similar, these two questions are different. They are only equivalent when the following two sets are isomorphic: the set of continuous mappings from preferences to the model's outputs, and the set of continuous mappings from utilities to the model's outputs. In this paper, we study the topology for preference spaces defined by such an isomorphism. This study is practically significant, as continuity analysis is predominantly conducted through utility functions, rather than the underlying preference space. Our findings enable researchers to infer continuity in utility as indicative of continuity in underlying preferences.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们称模型在效用(或偏好)上是连续的，如果效用函数(或偏好)的微小扰动会导致模型输出的微小变化。虽然类似，但这两个问题是不同的。它们仅在以下两个集合同构时才等价：从偏好到模型输出的连续映射集合，以及从效用到模型输出的连续映射集合。在本文中，我们研究了由此同构定义的偏好空间的拓扑。这项研究在实践上具有重要意义，因为连续性分析主要通过效用函数而非潜在偏好空间进行。我们的发现使研究人员能够推断效用上的连续性表明底层偏好的连续性。",
