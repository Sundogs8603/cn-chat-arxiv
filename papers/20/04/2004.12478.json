    "translated_abstract": "近期文献中已经广泛研究了对于$\\ell_p$限制下受到图像扰动的鲁棒性。但是，现实中的扰动很少表现出$\\ell_p$威胁模型所假定的像素独立性。最近提出了一个基于Wasserstein距离限制的威胁模型，它限制扰动为像素质量移动。我们指出并纠正了先前Wasserstein威胁模型定义中的缺陷，并在我们更好地定义的框架下探索了更强的攻击和防御。最后，我们讨论了当前Wasserstein-鲁棒模型在防御现实世界中出现的扰动方面的无能为力。我们的代码和训练模型可在https://github.com/edwardjhu/improved_wasserstein找到。",
