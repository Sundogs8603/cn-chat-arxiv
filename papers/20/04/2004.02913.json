    "abstract": "Recent work in Dialogue Act (DA) classification approaches the task as a sequence labeling problem, using neural network models coupled with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) as the last layer. CRF models the conditional probability of the target DA label sequence given the input utterance sequence. However, the task involves another important input sequence, that of speakers, which is ignored by previous work. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a simple modification of the CRF layer that takes speaker-change into account. Experiments on the SwDA corpus show that our modified CRF layer outperforms the original one, with very wide margins for some DA labels. Further, visualizations demonstrate that our CRF layer can learn meaningful, sophisticated transition patterns between DA label pairs conditioned on speaker-change in an end-to-end way. Code is publicly available.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近在对话行为（DA）分类方面的研究将该任务作为一个序列标注问题，使用神经网络模型以及作为最后一层的条件随机场（CRF）。CRF模型根据输入话语序列来建模目标DA标签序列的条件概率。然而，该任务还涉及到另一个重要的输入序列，即说话人序列，而先前的工作在这方面没有做出考虑。为了解决这个限制，本文提出了一种简单的CRF层的修改，该层考虑到说话人变化。对SwDA语料库的实验表明，我们修改后的CRF层优于原始层，在某些DA标签上的差距非常大。此外，可视化展示了我们的CRF层可以以端到端的方式学习在说话人交替条件下DA标签对之间的有意义的、复杂的转移模式。代码已公开发布。",
