    "translated_abstract": "在真实世界中，机器人的顺序决策是一个挑战，因为它要求机器人同时推理当前世界状态和动态，同时规划行动以完成复杂任务。一方面，声明性语言和推理算法能够良好地支持表示和处理常识知识。但是这些算法在规划未指定时间跨度下的最大累积奖励的行动时表现不佳。另一方面，概率规划框架（如马尔可夫决策过程（MDPs）和部分可观察到的MDPs（POMDPs））能够很好地支持在不确定性条件下规划实现长期目标。但是它们不能很好地表示或推理与行动无直接关联的知识。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的算法称为iCORPP，以同时估计当前世界状态，推理世界动态和构建任务导向的控制器。",
