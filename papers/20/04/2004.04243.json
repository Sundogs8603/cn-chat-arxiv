    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种对话系统实用组件，可以获取用户的最后两个话语，并检测最后一句话是否是对第二句话的错误纠正。如果是，则根据最后一句话中的错误纠正来纠正第二句话。此外，所提出的组件输出了被修复和修复体的提取对。这个组件提供了两个优点，一是学习纠正的概念以避免为每个新域收集纠正，二是提取被修复和修复对，从而提供学习的可能性。对于错误纠正，我们提出了一种序列标签和两种序列到序列方法。对于错误纠正检测，这三种错误纠正方法也可以被用来，并且我们还提出了一种序列分类方法。一个错误纠正检测和一个错误纠正方法可以组合成一个流水线，或者错误纠正方法可以被分别使用。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种对话系统实用组件，可自动检测和修正用户发出的请求信息中的错误，并将修正信息进行提取对，以实现学习和避免重复开发的优势。该方法适用于多种语序列标签、序列到序列和序列分类等情形。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a dialog system utility component that can automatically detect and correct errors in user requests and extract metadata for learning purposes. The system offers the advantages of avoiding duplicate development and learning from previous corrections, using various approaches including sequence labeling, sequence to sequence, and sequence classification."
