    "abstract": "People often receive good news that makes them feel better about the world around them, or bad news that makes them feel worse about it. This paper studies how the valence of news affects belief updating, absent functional and ego-relevant factors. Using experiments with over 1,500 participants and 5,600 observations, I test whether people engage in motivated reasoning to overly trust good news versus bad news on valence-relevant issues like cancer survival rates, others' happiness, and infant mortality. The estimate for motivated reasoning towards good news is a precisely-estimated null. Modest effects, of one-third the size of motivated reasoning in politics and performance, can be ruled out. Complementary survey evidence shows that most people expect good news to increase happiness, but to not systematically lead to motivated reasoning. These results suggest that belief-based utility is not sufficient in leading people to distort belief updating in order to favor those beliefs.",

    "translated_abstract": "人们常常收到使他们对周围世界感觉更好的好消息，或者使他们对周围世界感觉更糟的坏消息。本文研究了新闻的价值对信念更新的影响，不考虑功能性和自我相关因素。通过对1,500多名参与者和5,600次观察的实验，我测试了人们是否在与癌症存活率、他人幸福和婴儿死亡率相关的问题上，对好消息过分信任而不是坏消息的动机推理。对于对好消息的动机推理的估计是一个精确估计的空值。相对于政治和绩效方面的动机推理，可以排除出相对较小的影响。补充的调查证据表明，大多数人期望好消息会增加幸福感，但不会系统地导致动机推理。这些结果表明，基于信念的效用不足以使人们扭曲信念更新，以支持这些信念。",
