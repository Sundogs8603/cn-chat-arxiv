    "translated_abstract": "我们探讨了大脑中的神经元与社会中的人类之间的利维坦类比，问自己是否个体智能对于集体智能的产生是必要的，更重要的是，怎样的个体智能有利于更大的集体智能。首先，我们回顾了连接主义认知科学、基于代理的建模、群体心理学、经济学和物理学的不同洞见。随后，我们将这些洞见应用于Lotka-Volterra模型中导致掠食者和猎物要么共存要么全球灭绝的智能类型和程度。我们发现几个个体行为 - 尤其是掠食者的行为 - 有利于共存，最终在一个平衡点周围产生震荡。然而，我们也发现，如果猎物和掠食者都足够智能以推断彼此的行为，共存就会伴随着两个种群的无限增长。由于Lotka-Volterra模型是不稳定的，我们提出了一些未来的研究方向来解决这个问题。",
