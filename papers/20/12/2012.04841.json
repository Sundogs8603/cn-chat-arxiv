    "translated_abstract": "卷积神经网络（CNN）是一种有前景的技术，用于自动诊断眼底图像中的青光眼，这些图像通常在眼科检查中获取。然而，CNN通常需要大量标记良好的数据进行训练，而在许多生物医学图像分类应用中可能无法获得足够的数据，特别是在罕见疾病或专家标记成本高昂的情况下。本文有两个贡献来解决这个问题：（1）它扩展了传统的孪生网络，引入一种在标记数据有限且不平衡的情况下进行小样本学习的训练方法；（2）它引入了一种新颖的半监督学习策略，利用额外的未标记训练数据来提高准确性。我们提出的多任务孪生网络（MTSN）可以使用任何骨干CNN，并且我们通过四个骨干CNN的实验证明，其在有限的训练数据上的准确性接近经过训练的骨干CNN的准确性。",
