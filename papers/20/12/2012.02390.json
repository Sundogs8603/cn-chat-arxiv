    "translated_abstract": "偏识别文献中一个基本问题是：关于政策相关的参数，我们能从可观测的外生变化中学到什么，而这些参数并不一定通过外生变化被点识别。本文通过对 Vytlacil(2002) 中的潜在变量选择模型进行尖锐、解析的刻画和边界提出了一个答案，涉及到一类重要的政策相关的处理效应，包括边际处理效应和其中的线性泛函。这些尖锐边界利用了已识别的边际分布的全部内容，解析推导依赖于随机顺序理论。所提出的方法还使得可以利用新的辅助分布假设尖锐地将其纳入潜在变量选择框架中。在实证方面，本文应用这些方法来研究医疗补助对俄勒冈州健康保险实验中急诊室利用率的影响，显示基于外推的预测与随机分配实验的结果有很好的吻合性。",
