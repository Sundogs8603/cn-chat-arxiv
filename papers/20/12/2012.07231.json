    "translated_abstract": "多目标进化算法（MOEA）在实践中的成功远远超过了理论研究的进展。特别是，以前的理论工作主要考虑由单峰目标组成的简单问题。为了更深入地了解进化算法如何解决多峰多目标问题，本文提出了OJZJ问题，这是一个由两个与经典跳跃函数基准同构的目标组成的双目标问题。我们证明了对于SEMO，无论运行时间如何，概率都不可能计算出完整的 Pareto 前沿。相反，对于所有问题大小n和所有跳跃大小k∈[ 4 . . n 2 −1 ]，全局SEMO（GSEMO）在 Θ ((n−2k)n^k）次迭代中覆盖 Pareto 前沿预期。",
    "tldr": "本文证明了当运行时间为无穷大时，SEMO无法找到所有Pareto前沿。但全局SEMO证明了在期望迭代次数上限内找到了所有Pareto前沿，这对于理解多目标进化算法在多峰问题中的应用具有参考价值。"
