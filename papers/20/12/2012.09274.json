    "translated_abstract": "在人类感知规划中，规划代理可能需要向人类用户解释为什么它的计划是最优的。一种流行的方法是通过模型调和来实现，其中代理尝试协调其模型与人类模型中的差异，使得计划在人类模型中也是最优的。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于逻辑的模型调和框架，扩展到规划领域之外。具体而言，给定一个包含命题公式 $\\varphi$ 的知识库 $KB_1$ 和一个不包含它的知识库 $KB_2$，模型调和寻求一个解释，即 $KB_1$ 的基数最小的子集，将其整合到 $KB_2$ 中使得包含成立。我们的方法利用了在矛盾分析领域中产生的最小修正集（MCSes）和最小不可满足集（MUSes）之间的命中集对偶关系，以找到合适的解释。",
