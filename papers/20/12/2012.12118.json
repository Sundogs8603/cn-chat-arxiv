    "abstract": "Governments have used social distancing to stem the spread of COVID-19, but lack evidence on the most effective policy to ensure compliance. We examine the effectiveness of fines and informational messages (nudges) in promoting social distancing in a web-based interactive experiment conducted during the first wave of the pandemic on a near-representative sample of the US population. Fines promote distancing, but nudges only have a marginal impact. Individuals do more social distancing when they are aware they are a superspreader. Using an instrumental variable approach, we argue progressives are more likely to practice distancing, and they are marginally more responsive to fines.",

    "translated_abstract": "政府使用社交距离来遏制新冠病毒的传播，但是缺乏关于最有效的政策以确保遵守的证据。我们在流行病第一波期间在美国人口的近似代表样本上进行了一个基于Web的交互式实验，研究了罚款和信息提示（nudges）在促进社交距离方面的有效性。罚款可以促进社交距离，但提示仅有微弱的影响。当人们意识到自己是超级传播者时，他们会进行更多的社交距离。使用工具变量方法，我们认为进步派更有可能实行社交距离，并且他们对罚款的反应更强。",
