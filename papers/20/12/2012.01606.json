    "translated_abstract": "域自适应是通过利用辅助源域中的现有标记数据来减少目标域注释成本的任务，已经引起了研究界的广泛关注。然而，标准的域自适应假设两个域中都有完全观察到的数据，而在实际应用中，缺少数据的存在是普遍的。在本文中，我们处理了更具挑战性的域自适应情景，即具有部分观察到的数据的不完整目标领域。我们提出了一种基于不完整数据插补的对抗网络（IDIAN）模型来解决这一新的域自适应挑战。在所提出的模型中，我们设计了一个数据插补模块来填补基于目标域局部观察到的数据中的缺失特征值，并通过深度对抗适应来对齐两个域。我们在跨域基准任务和具有不完整目标领域的实际适应任务上进行了实验。实验结果表明，与最先进的方法相比，我们所提出的IDIAN模型具有更好的性能。",
