    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一种在线二进制预测设置，其中预测员逐个观察一系列T个比特位。在揭示每个比特位之前，预测员预测该比特位为1的概率。如果对于每个p∈[0,1]，在预测员预测概率为p的n_p个比特位中，实际出现的1的数量m_p确实等于p⋅n_p，则称预测员具有良好校准性。校准误差定义为∑_p|mp⋅p⋅np|，用来衡量预测员偏离良好校准性的程度。尽管已经知道即使在比特位是对抗性选择的情况下，基于之前的预测也可能实现O(T^(2/3))的校准误差，但是对于下界方面几乎没有任何了解，除了通过独立公平硬币翻转的平凡例子得到的Ω(√T)下界。在本文中，我们证明了校准误差的Ω(T^(0.528))下界，这是第一个超过√T的下界。",
