    "translated_abstract": "虽然深度学习（DL）在自动化简单任务方面的潜力已经得到了广泛探索，但最近的研究开始探索使用深度学习进行创造性设计，无论是完整的产品创作还是支持人类在创作过程中的角色。本文利用计算创造力的见解，概念化和评估了文献综述中确定的创造性领域中当前应用生成式深度学习的情况。我们强调了当前系统与不同模型人类创造力的相似之处以及它们的不足之处。虽然深度学习可以产生高质量的图像等高价值结果，但其新颖性通常受到多种限制，例如受到训练数据定义的概念空间的限制。当前的DL方法也不允许对内部问题表达进行更改，并且它们缺乏在高度不同的领域之间建立联系的能力，这两点都被认为是主要的推动力。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文探讨了深度学习在创意领域的应用，并使用计算创造力的视角对其进行了概念化和评估。研究发现，尽管深度学习可以产生高质量的结果，但其创新性受到限制，同时也存在内部问题表达无法更改以及在不同领域之间建立联系的缺乏能力的问题。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the application of deep learning in creative domains and conceptualizes and assesses it using insights from computational creativity. The study finds that while deep learning can generate high-quality results, its novelty is limited and it lacks the ability to change internal problem representations and establish connections across different domains."
