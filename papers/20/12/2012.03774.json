    "translated_abstract": "在人工智能（AI）和机器学习（ML）领域中，使用有限的实例$S={(\\mathbf{x^{(i)}},y^{(i)})}$来近似未知目标函数$y=f(\\mathbf{x})$，其中$\\mathbf{x^{(i)}}\\in D$，$D$表示感兴趣的领域，是一个常见的目标。我们将$S$称为训练集，并旨在找到一个低复杂度的数学模型，可以有效地近似这个目标函数对于新的实例$\\mathbf{x}$。因此，模型的泛化能力通过在一个单独的集合$T=\\{\\mathbf{x^{(j)}}\\}\\subset D$上进行评估，其中$T\\neq S$，经常有$T\\cap S=\\emptyset$，以评估其在训练集之外的表现。然而，某些应用不仅需要在原始领域$D$内准确近似，还需要在包含$D$的扩展领域$D'$内准确近似。这在涉及新结构设计的场景中尤为重要，因为最小化近似误差至关重要。",
