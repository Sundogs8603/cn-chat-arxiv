    "abstract": "We introduce a boosting algorithm to pre-process data for fairness. Starting from an initial fair but inaccurate distribution, our approach shifts towards better data fitting while still ensuring a minimal fairness guarantee. To do so, it learns the sufficient statistics of an exponential family with boosting-compliant convergence. Importantly, we are able to theoretically prove that the learned distribution will have a representation rate and statistical rate data fairness guarantee. Unlike recent optimization based pre-processing methods, our approach can be easily adapted for continuous domain features. Furthermore, when the weak learners are specified to be decision trees, the sufficient statistics of the learned distribution can be examined to provide clues on sources of (un)fairness. Empirical results are present to display the quality of result on real-world data.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种利用增强算法对数据进行公平预处理的方法。从一个初始的公平但不准确的分布开始，我们的方法在确保最小公平性保证的同时朝着更好的数据拟合方向进行转移。为此，它学习了一个具有增强收敛性的指数族的充分统计量。重要的是，我们能够从理论上证明学习的分布将具有表示率和统计率的数据公平性保证。与最近的基于优化的预处理方法不同，我们的方法可以轻松适应连续域特征。此外，当弱学习者被指定为决策树时，可以检查学习分布的充分统计量，以提供（不）公平性的来源线索。通过实证结果展示了在真实数据上的结果质量。",
