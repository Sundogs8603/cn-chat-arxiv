    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种新颖的可解释的基于树的回归算法。我们的动机是从功能分解的角度估计未知的回归函数，其中功能组件对应于低阶交互项。我们的思路是修改随机森林算法，通过在切分后保留某些叶子而不是删除它们。这导致非二进制树，我们称之为种植树。将其扩展为一个森林，我们得到了我们的随机种植森林算法。此外，可以对叶子内可以相互作用的协变量数量进行限制。如果我们将交互限制设置为1，得到的估计量是一维函数的和。在另一个极端情况下，如果我们不设置限制，得到的估计量和相应的模型对回归函数的形式不加限制。在模拟研究中，我们发现我们的随机种植森林算法具有鼓励人的预测和可视化特性。",
