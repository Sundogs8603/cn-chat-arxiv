    "translated_abstract": "低健康素养的患者通常很难理解医学术语和专业医学语言的复杂结构。尽管有一些研究提出了自动将专业语言翻译成普通人可以理解的语言，但其中只有少数关注了临床领域中准确性和可读性的两个方面。因此，临床语言的简化仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务，但可惜的是，在之前的工作中尚未完全解决。为了评估这项任务，我们构建了一个名为MedLane的新数据集，以支持自动临床语言简化方法的开发和评估。此外，我们提出了一种名为DECLARE的新模型，遵循人工注释过程，与八种强基准模型相比取得了最先进的性能。为了公平评估性能，我们还提出了三个特定的评估指标。实验结果表明了MedLane数据集的实用性。",
