    "translated_abstract": "投资者普遍表现出处置效应，即在卖出赢利的投资时情绪上的倾向，而坚持持有亏损的投资。虽然这种现象已在许多传统市场中被观察到，但不清楚它是否也适用于像加密资产这样的非典型市场。本文使用针对加密资产交易所的交易作为卖出交易的替代品，研究了比特币中处置效应的普遍性。我们的研究结果表明，比特币投资者确实受到处置效应的影响，但其强度各不相同。同时，我们还发现处置效应在观察期内并不一直存在，它在2017年以后的繁荣与低迷年份更为显著，得到了各种技术指标的证实。我们的研究表明，非理性投资者行为也存在于像比特币这样的非典型市场中。",
    "tldr": "本研究探究了比特币市场中投资者的处置效应，研究结果显示比特币投资者普遍表现出这种非理性行为，其强度和普遍性随时间变化。这一发现揭示了在非典型市场中也存在着非理性的投资行为。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates the disposition effect among investors in the Bitcoin market, finding evidence of widespread irrational behavior, which varies in intensity and prevalence over time. These findings highlight the presence of irrational investment behavior in atypical markets as well."
