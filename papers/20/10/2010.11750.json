    "abstract": "The problem of learning one task with samples from another task has received much interest recently. In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: when is combining data from two tasks better than learning one task alone? Intuitively, the transfer effect from one task to another task depends on dataset shifts such as sample sizes and covariance matrices. However, quantifying such a transfer effect is challenging since we need to compare the risks between joint learning and single-task learning, and the comparative advantage of one over the other depends on the exact kind of dataset shift between both tasks. This paper uses random matrix theory to tackle this challenge in a linear regression setting with two tasks. We give precise asymptotics about the excess risks of some commonly used estimators in the high-dimensional regime, when the sample sizes increase proportionally with the feature dimension at fixed ratios. The precise asymptotics is provided as a function of the sample sizes ",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，学习一个任务时使用来自另一个任务的样本的问题引起了广泛关注。本文提出了一个基本问题：什么时候将来自两个任务的数据合并比单独学习一个任务更好？直观上，从一个任务到另一个任务的转移效应取决于数据集的转移，如样本大小和协方差矩阵。然而，量化这种转移效应是具有挑战性的，因为我们需要比较联合学习和单任务学习之间的风险，并且一个任务是否比另一个任务具有比较优势取决于两个任务之间确切的数据集转移类型。本文利用随机矩阵理论在具有两个任务的线性回归设置中解决了这一挑战。我们给出了在高维情况下一些常用估计量的超额风险的精确渐近分析，当样本大小与特征维度成比例增加时，固定比例。精确渐近分析以样本大小的函数形式给出。",
