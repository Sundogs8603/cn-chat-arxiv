Asymmetric hidden Markov models fulfil this dynamical requirement and provide a framework where the trend of the process can be expressed as a latent variable. In this paper, we modify these recent asymmetric hidden Markov models to have an asymmetric autoregressive component, allowing the model to choose the order of autoregression that maximizes its penalized likelihood for a given training set. Additionally, we show how inference, hidden states decoding and parameter learning must be adapted to fit the proposed model.

    "translated_abstract": "在一个随时间演变的真实过程中，相关变量之间的关系可能会改变。因此，为每个过程状态拥有不同的推理模型是有优势的。非对称隐马尔可夫模型满足这种动态要求，并提供一个框架，其中过程的趋势可以被表示为一个潜变量。在本文中，我们修改了这些最近的非对称隐马尔可夫模型，使其具有非对称自回归分量，使模型能够选择最大化给定训练集的惩罚似然的自回归阶数。此外，我们展示了必须如何调整推理、隐藏状态解码和参数学习来适应所提出的模型。最后，我们使用合成数据和实际数据进行实验，以展示这个新模型的能力。",

By modifying the base model with an asymmetric autoregressive component, the model can automatically choose the order of autoregression that maximizes its penalized likelihood for a given training set. Experiments with synthetic and real data are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the new model."
