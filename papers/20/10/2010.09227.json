In particular, placing products in desirable locations increases demand. This primary effect on shelf position is clear, but there is a secondary effect based on the relative positioning of nearby products. Intuitively, products located next to each other are more likely to be compared having positive and negative effects. On the one hand, locations closer to relatively strong products will be undesirable, as these strong products will draw demand from others -- an effect that is stronger for those in close proximity. On the other hand, because strong products tend to attract more traffic, locations closer to them elicit high consumer attention by increased visibility. Modifying the GEV class of models to allow demand to be moderated by competitors' proximity, these two effects emerge naturally. We found that although the competition effect is usually stronger, it is not alway",

    "translated_abstract": "货架设计决策强烈影响产品需求。特别是将产品放置在理想位置会增加需求。货架位置对需求有主要影响，但也存在基于附近产品相对位置的次要影响。直觉上，相邻位置的产品更有可能被比较，产生积极和消极效应。通过修改GEV类模型，以允许需求受竞争对手的接近程度调节，这两种效应会自然产生。",
