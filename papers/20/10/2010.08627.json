    "translated_abstract": "规范相关分析（CCA）是一种用于探索数据集之间关系的流行统计技术。近年来，稀疏规范向量的估计已成为CCA问题的一个重要且具有挑战性的变体，应用广泛。不幸的是，现有的稀疏规范向量的最优估计器计算成本较高。我们提出了一种准贝叶斯估计过程，既达到了最小最大估计速率，又可以通过马尔科夫链蒙特卡罗（MCMC）轻松计算。该方法基于Tan等人（2018）的研究，使用重新缩放的瑞利商函数作为准对数似然函数。然而，与Tan等人（2018）不同的是，我们采用了一个贝叶斯框架，将这个准对数似然函数与尖峰-平板先验结合起来进行规范化推理和促进稀疏性。我们研究了所提出方法在连续和截断数据上的经验行为，并证明它优于几种方法。",
