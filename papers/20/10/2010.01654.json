    "translated_abstract": "对于相关的多变量时间序列数据进行分位数特征选择一直是一种方法上的挑战和一个未解决的问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种通用的贝叶斯降维方法，用于高维联合分位数时间序列分析中的特征选择，该方法被称为分位数特征选择时间序列（QFSTS）模型。QFSTS模型是一个通用的结构时间序列模型，每个组成部分对时间序列建模产生了可直接解释的加性贡献。其灵活性体现在用户可以为每个时间序列添加/减少组成部分，并且每个时间序列可以具有不同大小的特定值组成部分。特征选择是在分位数回归组件中进行的，每个时间序列都有自己的同时外部预测变量池，允许进行即时预测。基于贝叶斯方法将特征选择扩展到分位数时间序列研究领域。",
