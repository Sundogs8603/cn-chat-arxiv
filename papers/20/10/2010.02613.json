    "translated_abstract": "在未知环境中的数据驱动控制需要对涉及的不确定性有清晰的理解，以确保安全和高效的探索。虽然由于测量误差而产生的随机不确定性可以在给定参数化描述的情况下明确地进行建模，但对于描述训练数据的存在或不存在的认知不确定性，建模可能更加困难。当系统动态未知时，后者在实施探索性控制策略时特别有用。我们提出了一种新颖的方法，利用深度学习来检测训练数据的缺失，其输出一个介于0（表示低不确定性）和1（表示高不确定性）之间的连续值标量。我们将这个检测器作为认知不确定性的代理，并展示了其在合成和真实数据集上相对现有方法的优势。我们的方法可以直接与随机不确定性估计相结合，并允许实时进行不确定性估计。",
