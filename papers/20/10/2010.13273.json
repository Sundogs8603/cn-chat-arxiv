    "translated_abstract": "在数据湖中寻找可连接表是许多应用的关键过程，例如数据集成、数据增强、数据分析和数据市场。传统的方法只能找到等值连接的表，无法处理拼写错误和不同的格式，也无法捕捉到任何语义连接。在本文中，我们提出了PEXESO，一种用于在数据湖中发现可连接表的框架。我们将文本值嵌入到高维向量中，并在高维向量上使用相似性谓词来连接列，从而解决了等值连接方法的限制，并且能够识别出更有意义的结果。为了高效地找到具有相似性的可连接表，我们提出了一种基于块和验证的方法，利用基于中心点的过滤技术。针对数据湖很大且索引无法适应主内存的情况，我们开发了一种分区技术。实验评估结果表明，与等值连接和公共自然语言处理方法相比，我们的解决方案能够识别出更多的表。",
