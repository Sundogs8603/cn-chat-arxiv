In this paper, we present VENOMAVE, the first training-time poisoning attack against speech recognition. Similar to the predominantly studied evasion attacks, we pursue the same goal: leading the system to an incorrect and attacker-chosen transcription of a target audio waveform.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管自动语音识别取得了显著的改进，但仍容易受到对抗性干扰。与标准的机器学习架构相比，这些攻击更加具有挑战性，尤其是因为语音识别系统的输入是包含语音的声学和语言属性的时间序列。提取所有识别相关信息需要更复杂的流程和一组专门的组件。因此，攻击者需要考虑整个流程。本文介绍了VenoMave，这是针对语音识别的第一种训练期毒化攻击。与主要研究规避攻击相似，我们追求相同的目标：将系统引导到目标音频波形的不正确和攻击者选择的转录。然而，与规避攻击不同的是，我们假定攻击者只能操纵一小部分训练数据，而不会在运行时改变目标音频波形。",
