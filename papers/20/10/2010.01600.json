    "abstract": "Temporal data (such as news articles or Twitter feeds) often consists of a mixture of long-lasting trends and popular but short-lasting topics of interest. A truly successful topic modeling strategy should be able to detect both types of topics and clearly locate them in time. In this paper, we first show that nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (NCPD) is able to discover topics of variable persistence automatically. Then, we propose sparseness-constrained NCPD (S-NCPD) and its online variant in order to actively control the length of the learned topics effectively and efficiently. Further, we propose quantitative ways to measure the topic length and demonstrate the ability of S-NCPD (as well as its online variant) to discover short and long-lasting temporal topics in a controlled manner in semi-synthetic and real-world data including news headlines. We also demonstrate that the online variant of S-NCPD reduces the reconstruction error more rapidly than S-NCPD.",

    "translated_abstract": "时间数据（如新闻文章或Twitter动态）通常包含持久趋势和短暂热门主题的混合。一个成功的主题建模策略应能够检测这两种类型的主题，并清晰地定位它们在时间上的位置。本文首先展示了非负CANDECOMP/PARAFAC分解（NCPD）能够自动发现持续时间变化的主题。然后，我们提出了稀疏约束的NCPD（S-NCPD）及其在线变体，以有效且高效地控制学习到的主题长度。此外，我们提出了量化衡量主题长度的方法，并在半合成和真实世界数据（包括新闻标题）中展示了S-NCPD（以及其在线变体）发现短期和长期时态主题的能力。我们还证明了S-NCPD的在线变体比S-NCPD更快地减少重构误差。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method based on sparse-constrained nonnegative tensor factorization to detect and locate topics at different time scales. By introducing sparse constraints and an online learning variant, it effectively controls the length of learned topics and demonstrates good performance in discovering short-term and long-term temporal topics in experiments."
