    "translated_abstract": "在网页指纹识别中，通过分析用户浏览器与网站服务器之间的加密TLS流量中的模式，路径上的对手能够推断出受害用户加载的具体网页。本研究针对TLS协议研究现代网页指纹识别对手，旨在揭示其能力并提供潜在的防御信息。尽管这个研究领域的重要性（全球大多数互联网用户依赖于带有TLS的标准网页浏览）和潜在的实际影响，但大多数过去的研究都集中在针对匿名网络（如Tor）的特定攻击上。我们引入了一种特定于TLS的模型，它可以：1）扩展到前所未有的目标网页数量，2）可以准确地对数千个在训练期间从未遇到的类别进行分类，3）即使在频繁页面更新的情况下也具有较低的运营成本。基于这些研究结果，我们讨论了TLS-specific的对策，并评估了现有对策的有效性。",
