    "translated_abstract": "经济和金融历史中经常出现的周期性的繁荣与衰退是一个显著特征。数据中发现的周期是随机的，通常具有很高的持续性，并占据了样本的大部分。我们将这样的周期称为“长周期”。在本文中，我们开发了一种新的建模方法，专门设计用于捕捉长周期的行为。我们发现，在存在长周期的情况下，现有的推断过程可能会产生误导性的结果，并提出了一种新的计量经济学程序来推断周期的长度。我们的程序在周期长度上渐近有效。我们将我们的方法应用于美国的一组宏观经济和金融变量。我们发现标准的商业周期变量以及信贷和房价中存在长期的随机周期。然而，我们排除了资产市场数据中存在随机周期的可能性。根据我们的结果，金融周期可以通过信贷和房价来描述。",
