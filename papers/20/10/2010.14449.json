    "translated_abstract": "我们在高维度的误差变量固定设计环境中分析了主成分回归(PCR)。在适当的条件下，我们证明了PCR能够一致地识别出具有最小L2范数的唯一模型。这些结果使我们能够建立起优于已知最佳速率的非渐进的样本外预测保证。在我们的分析过程中，我们引入了一种自然的线性代数条件，联系了样本内和样本外的协变量，从而避免了对样本外预测的分布假设。我们的模拟实验证明了此条件在泛化方面的重要性，即使在协变量漂移的情况下也是如此。因此，我们构建了一个假设检验来检查这个条件在实践中是否成立。此外，我们的结果还为合成对照文献提供了新的发现，合成对照是一种主要的政策评估方法。据我们所知，我们在固定设计环境中的预测保证尚未被研究过。",
