    "translated_abstract": "对抗性建模（如生成性对抗网络（GAN））重新燃起了人们对双人极小-极大博弈的兴趣。该类博弈优化的一个主要难题是旋转动力学阻碍其收敛。本文表明，博弈优化共享粒子系统受多重力的动力学特性，可以利用物理学中的工具来改进优化动力学。受物理框架启发，我们提出一个用于极小-极大博弈的优化器LEAD。接下来，我们使用李亚普诺夫稳定性理论和谱分析，在连续和离散时间设置下研究了LEAD在一类二次极小-极大博弈中的收敛特性，展示了线性收敛到纳什均衡。最后，我们在合成数据集和CIFAR-10图像生成上对我们的方法进行了实证评估，证明了GAN训练中的改进效果。",
