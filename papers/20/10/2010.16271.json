    "translated_abstract": "多视角堆叠是一种将来自不同视图（即不同的特征集）描述相同对象的信息相结合的框架。在该框架中，基学习算法分别在每个视图上进行训练，它们的预测结果由元学习算法组合。在之前的研究中，堆叠的罚分逻辑回归，作为多视角堆叠的一种特殊情况，已被证明在识别对预测最重要的视图方面是有用的。在本文中，我们通过考虑七种不同的算法作为元学习器，并在模拟和两个真实的基因表达数据集上评估它们的视图选择和分类性能，扩展了这项研究。我们的结果表明，如果视图选择和分类准确性对研究都很重要，那么非负套索、非负自适应套索和非负弹性网络都是合适的元学习器。具体在这三种方法中该选择哪一种取决于...",
