    "translated_abstract": "动态离散博弈的文献经常假定条件选择概率和状态转移概率在不同市场和时间上是同质的。我们称之为“动态离散博弈中的同质性假设”。该假设使得经验研究可以通过汇总多个市场和多个时间段的数据来估计游戏的结构参数。本文提出了一个假设检验来评估数据是否符合同质性假设。我们的假设检验是通过马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗（MCMC）算法实现近似随机化检验的结果。我们证明了当（用户定义的）MCMC抽样次数趋于无穷大时，我们的假设检验就是有效的，对于任何固定的市场、时间段和玩家数量。我们将我们的检验应用于瑞安（2012）对美国波特兰水泥工业的经验研究中。",

The test uses an approximate randomization method implemented via a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and becomes valid as the number of MCMC draws approaches infinity. The test is applied to an empirical study of the U.S. Portland cement industry."
