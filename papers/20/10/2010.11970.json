In particular, we aim to circumvent the curse of dimensionality in Wasserstein distance: when the dimension is high, it has diminishing testing power, which is inherently due to the slow concentration property of Wasserstein metrics in the high dimension space. A key contribution is to couple optimal projection to find the low dimensional linear mapping to maximize the Wasserstein distance between projected probability distributions. We characterize the theoretical property of the finite-sample convergence rate on IPMs and present practical algorithms for computing this metric. Numerical examples validate our theoretical results.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一种使用投影Wasserstein距离进行双样本检验的方法，这是统计学和机器学习中的一个基本问题：给定两组样本，确定它们是否来自同一分布。我们的目标是避免Wasserstein距离中的维度灾难：当维度很高时，它的测试能力会显著减弱，这主要是由于高维空间中Wasserstein度量的缓慢集中特性所致。一个关键贡献是将最优投影耦合在一起，找到低维线性映射以最大化投影概率分布之间的Wasserstein距离。我们刻画了IPM中有限样本收敛速率的理论特性，并提出了用于计算该度量的实际算法。数值实例验证了我们的理论结果。",
