    "translated_abstract": "卷积神经网络（CNNs）被成功应用于重要的汽车视觉感知任务，包括目标识别、运动和深度估计、视觉SLAM等。然而，这些任务通常是独立探索和建模的。本文提出了一种联合多任务网络设计，同时学习多个任务。我们的主要动机是通过在所有任务之间共享昂贵的初始卷积层来实现计算效率。事实上，自动驾驶系统中的主要瓶颈是部署硬件上可用的有限处理能力。还有一些证据表明，对于某些任务来说，在提高准确性方面存在其他好处，并且可以减轻开发工作量。它还提供了可伸缩性，可以通过利用现有特征增加更多任务，并实现更好的泛化。我们调查了自动驾驶中用于视觉感知任务的各种基于CNN的解决方案。",
