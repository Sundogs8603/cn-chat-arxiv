    "abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) power generation has emerged as one of the lead renewable energy sources. Yet, its production is characterized by high uncertainty, being dependent on weather conditions like solar irradiance and temperature. Predicting PV production, even in the 24-hour forecast, remains a challenge and leads energy providers to left idling - often carbon emitting - plants. In this paper, we introduce a Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Network using Numerical Weather Predictions (NWP) to predict, in turn, PV production in the 24-hour and 48-hour forecast horizons. This network architecture fully leverages both temporal and spatial weather data, sampled over the whole geographical area of interest. We train our model on an NWP dataset from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to predict spatially aggregated PV production in Germany. We compare its performance to the persistence model and state-of-the-art methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "光伏发电是一种重要的可再生能源之一，然而其产量受天气条件（如太阳辐射和温度）的影响而具有高度的不确定性。即使是在24小时预测中，光伏发电的预测仍然是一个挑战，导致能源供应商需要启动（往往还会排放碳）的发电厂。在本文中，我们介绍了一种利用数值天气预报（NWP）的长期循环卷积网络，用于预测24小时和48小时的光伏发电预测。该网络架构充分利用了整个感兴趣地区上采样的时间和空间天气数据。我们使用美国国家海洋和大气管理局（NOAA）的NWP数据集对模型进行训练，以预测德国的空间聚合光伏发电量，并将其性能与持续模型和最先进的方法进行了比较。",
