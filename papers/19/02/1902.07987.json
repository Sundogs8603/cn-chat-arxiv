    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在粒子重建的背景下使用图网络处理不规则几何形状探测器的方法。由于图网络的表示学习能力，它可以利用全部探测器的细节，同时本地管理事件稀疏性和任意复杂的探测器几何形状。我们介绍了两种距离加权图网络结构，被称为GarNet和GravNet层，并将它们应用于典型的粒子重建任务。新架构的表现在模拟粒子相互作用数据集上进行评估，使用了高度细致的卡仑计数器玩具模型，该模型受到了为高亮度LHC阶段安装在CMS探测器中的端盖卡仑计数器的启发。我们研究了能量沉积的聚类，这是 calorimetric 粒子重建的基础，并提供了与其他方法的定量比较。所提出的算法为现有方法提供了一种有趣的替代方案，为处理不规则探测器几何形状的粒子重建任务提供了有希望的解决方案。",
