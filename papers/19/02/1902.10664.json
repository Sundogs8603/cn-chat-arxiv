    "translated_abstract": "真实世界的数据的不均匀性，例如观测噪声水平的变化或源函数结构复杂性的变化，给统计推断带来了一系列独特的挑战。考虑到这些因素可以在物理资源或计算时间有限的情况下显著提高预测能力。本文借鉴了最近关于局部多项式平滑（LPS）领域中局部函数复杂性（LFC）的估计的理论结果，建立了一个局部结构复杂性的概念，并用它来开发一个与模型无关的主动学习（AL）框架。由于其依赖于点估计，LPS模型类在处理通常伴随真实世界问题的大输入空间维度时不具有鲁棒性和可伸缩性。在本文中，我们推导和估计基于高斯过程回归（GPR）的LPS-based LFC的类比，并将其作为以上框架的替代，使之具有鲁棒性和可伸缩性。",
