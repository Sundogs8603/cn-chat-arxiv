    "translated_abstract": "在信号/图像处理、医学图像存储、遥感、信号传输等研究领域中，常常需要基于有损或不完整样本的统计推断。本文提出了一种基于经计算效率高的算法对样本进行B位量化的非参数检验程序。在一些温和技术条件下，我们建立了所提出的检验统计量的渐近性质，并研究了检验功率在B增加时的变化。特别地，我们表明如果B超过某个阈值，则所提出的非参数检验程序在样条模型中实现了经典极小极值率的测试（Shang和Cheng，2015）。我们还进一步将理论研究扩展到了非参数直线性检验和自适应非参数检验，拓展了所提方法的适用性。我们使用广泛的模拟研究和实际数据分析来证明所提方法的有效性和效果。",
