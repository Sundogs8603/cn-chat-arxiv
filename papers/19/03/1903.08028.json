    "abstract": "How would states on the American frontier have developed in the absence of homestead policies? This paper explores the role of homestead policies, which opened for settlement hundreds of millions of acres of frontier land, in shaping the size of state governments. Using a matrix completion method, I predict the counterfactual time-series of frontier state size had there been no homesteading. I extend the method to allow for propensity-weighting of the loss function to control for selection bias. Causal estimates signify that homestead policies had significant and long-lasting negative impacts on state government expenditure and revenue. The estimates are in the same direction as those of a continuous difference-in-differences estimator that exploit variation in the timing and intensity of homestead entries, aggregated from 1.46 million individual land patent records.",

    "translated_abstract": "在没有土地政策的情况下，美国前沿州会如何发展？本文探讨了土地政策在开拓数百万英亩前沿土地定居方面对州政府规模的影响。使用矩阵完整性方法，作者预测了没有土地政策的情况下前沿州规模的反事实时间序列。作者扩展了方法，允许采用倾向加权的损失函数来控制选择偏差。因果估计意味着土地政策对州政府支出和收入产生了显著且持久的负面影响。估计结果与连续差异估计器的结果方向相同，后者利用了来自146万个个体土地专利记录的时间和强度的变异。",
