    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱是一种广泛用于表示知识的格式，且在语义搜索引擎、问答系统和推荐系统中有许多应用。然而，实际的知识图谱通常是不完整的，因此提出了基于嵌入向量方法，如CP、DistMult和ComplEx等，以解决此问题。这些方法将实体和关系表示为语义空间中的嵌入向量，并预测它们之间的链接。嵌入向量本身包含丰富的语义信息，可用于其他应用程序，如数据分析。但是，这些模型中的机制和嵌入向量本身变化很大，使其难以理解和比较。因此，我们需要以多嵌入交互的角度来分析和比较知识图谱嵌入方法。具体而言，我们研究了三种流行的方法（CP、DistMult和ComplEx），并研究它们的不同嵌入向量如何相互作用。我们的分析揭示了ComplEx性能更好的原因，并为开发新模型提供了见解。",
