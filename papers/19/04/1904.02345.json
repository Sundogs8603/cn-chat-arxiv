PNN also solves the Multi-label ranking problem, where labels may have indifference preference orders or subgroups are equally ranked. PNN follows a multi-layer feedforward architecture with fully connected neurons. Each neuron contains a novel smooth stairstep activation function based on the number of preference orders. PNN inputs represent data features and output neurons represent label indexes. The proposed PNN is evaluated using new preference mining dataset that contains repeated label values which have not experimented before. PNN outperforms five previously proposed methods for strict label ranking in terms of accurate results with high computational efficiency.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种偏好神经网络（PNN），采用新的激活函数解决了冷漠偏好排序的问题。PNN还解决了多标签排名问题，其中标签可能具有冷漠偏好顺序或子组平等排名。PNN采用多层前馈结构，具有完全连接的神经元。每个神经元都包含基于喜好顺序的新型平滑阶梯形激活函数。PNN输入表示数据特征，输出神经元表示标签索引。该PNN使用了包含未经过实验的重复标签值的新偏好挖掘数据集进行评估。在高计算效率下，PNN在严格标签排名的准确结果方面优于先前提出的五种方法。",
