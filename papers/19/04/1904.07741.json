    "translated_abstract": "文化演化是由我们选择什么消费和与他人分享驱动的。一个普遍的信念是，成功的文化作品在新颖性和常规性之间保持平衡。这种平衡理论认为，人们更喜欢那些熟悉而不乏味的作品；新颖，但又不违背其流派的预期。我们使用大量同人小说的数据集来测试这个想法。我们应用多元回归模型和广义加性模型来研究作品的认可程度如何随着其新颖性的变化而变化，通过潜在狄利克雷分配主题模型进行估计。我们发现与平衡理论预测相反的模式——总体上，作品的成功几乎随着新颖性的增加而下降，并呈现出U形曲线，而不是倒U形曲线。这个谜团通过揭示出两股相互竞争的力量得到了解决：同质性吸引了大众，而新颖性提供了欢乐。",
    "tldr": "该研究通过分析同人小说的大数据集，发现文化作品的成功与新颖性呈现出U形曲线的关系，而不是先增加后减弱，解决了平衡理论的谜团。"
