Agents learn from their observations and learning ability to interpret news or private information in time-varying networks. Under general assumption on the noise, a limit theorem is developed for the generalised DeGroot framework for certain type of conditions governing the learning. In this context, the agents beliefs (properly scaled) converge in distribution that is not necessarily normal. Fresh insights are gained not only from proposing a new setting for social learning models but also from using different techniques to study discrete time random linear dynamical systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了原始模型来研究金融市场和社交网络中的相互作用代理。在这些模型中，随机性是一种随着时间衰减的冲击或新闻形式。代理人通过观察学习，并具有解释时变网络中的新闻或私人信息的学习能力。在噪声的一般假设下，发展了一个极广义DeGroot框架的极限定理，适用于管理学习的某种类型条件。在这个背景下，代理人的信念（适当缩放）在分布上收敛，并不一定是正态分布。本研究不仅从提出社交学习模型的新设置中获得了新的洞见，而且还使用了不同的技术来研究离散时间随机线性动力系统。",
