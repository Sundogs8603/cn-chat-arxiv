Like Phragm\\'en's better-known iterative minimax method, it is assumed that the voters express themselves by means of approval voting. In contrast to the iterative minimax method, however, here one starts by fixing a quota, i.e. the number of votes that give the right to a seat. As a matter of fact, the method of Enestr\\\"om and Phragm\\'en can be seen as an extension of the method of largest remainders from closed lists to open lists, or also as an adaptation of the single transferable vote to approval rather than preferential voting. The properties of this method are studied and compared with those of other methods of the same kind.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种比例代表制的方法，该方法是在19世纪末20世纪初由古斯塔夫·Enestr\\\"om和爱德华·Phragm\\'en提出的。与Phragm\\'en更为人所知的迭代最小最大化方法类似，假定选民通过批准投票表达自己的意见。然而，与迭代最小最大化方法相比，这里是通过确定定额开始的，即获得一席位所需的选票数。事实上，Enestr\\\"om和Phragm\\'en的方法可以被看作是从封闭名单到开放名单的最大余数法的扩展，也可以被看作是将单一可转移选票方法调整为批准投票而不是优先投票。研究了该方法的特性，并与其他相似方法进行了比较。",
