    "abstract": "arXiv:1907.01743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Automatic prostate segmentation in transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images is of essential importance for image-guided prostate interventions and treatment planning. However, developing such automatic solutions remains very challenging due to the missing/ambiguous boundary and inhomogeneous intensity distribution of the prostate in TRUS, as well as the large variability in prostate shapes. This paper develops a novel 3D deep neural network equipped with attention modules for better prostate segmentation in TRUS by fully exploiting the complementary information encoded in different layers of the convolutional neural network (CNN). Our attention module utilizes the attention mechanism to selectively leverage the multilevel features integrated from different layers to refine the features at each individual layer, suppressing the non-prostate noise at shallow layers of the CNN and increasing more prostate details into features at deep",

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:1907.01743v2 公告类型: 替换-跨度  摘要: 在图像引导的前列腺干预和治疗计划中，自动前列腺分割在经直肠超声(TRUS)图像中至关重要。然而，由于 TRUS 中前列腺的边界缺失/模糊和不均匀的强度分布，以及前列腺形状的大量变异性，开发这样的自动解决方案仍然非常具有挑战性。本文发展了一种配备关注模块的新型3D深度神经网络，通过充分利用卷积神经网络 (CNN) 不同层中编码的互补信息，来更好地对 TRUS 中的前列腺进行分割。我们的关注模块利用关注机制，有选择地利用不同层集成的多级特征来完善每个单独层的特征，抑制 CNN 浅层中的非前列腺噪声，并将更多前列腺细节融入特征中。",
