    "abstract": "Due to the significance of transportation planning, traffic management, and dispatch optimization, predicting passenger origin-destination has emerged as a crucial requirement for intelligent transportation systems management. In this study, we present a model designed to forecast the origin and destination of travels within a specified time window. To derive meaningful travel flows, we employ K-means clustering in a four-dimensional space with a maximum cluster size constraint for origin and destination zones. Given the large number of clusters, we utilize non-negative matrix factorization to reduce the number of travel clusters. Furthermore, we implement a stacked recurrent neural network model to predict the travel count in each cluster. A comparison of our results with existing models reveals that our proposed model achieves a 5-7\\% lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for 1-hour time windows and a 14\\% lower MAPE for 30-minute time windows.",

    "translated_abstract": "预测乘客的起终点对智能交通管理中的交通规划、交通管理和调度优化有着重要的意义。本文提出了一种模型，用于在给定时间窗口内预测行程的起点和终点。我们采用K均值聚类在四维空间中进行聚类，并设置了起点和终点区域的最大聚类大小约束来确定有效的出行流。由于集群数量庞大，我们采用非负矩阵分解降低出行集群的数量。此外，我们还实现了一种堆叠循环神经网络模型，用于预测每个集群中的出行次数。与现有模型的结果比较表明，我们的模型在1小时和30分钟的时间窗口内实现了5-7\\%和14\\%的较低均方绝对误差（MAPE）。",
