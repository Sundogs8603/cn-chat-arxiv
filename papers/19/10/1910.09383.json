    "translated_abstract": "数据驱动的邻域定义和图构建在机器学习和信号处理应用中经常使用。k近邻（kNN）和 $\\epsilon$-邻域方法是最常用的邻域选择方法之一，由于其计算简单性。然而，这些方法所涉及的参数选择，如 k 和 $\\epsilon$，仍然是临时的。本文有两个主要贡献。首先，我们提出了一种邻域选择的替代方法，其中我们表明邻域构造等同于一个稀疏信号逼近问题。其次，我们提出了一种算法，非负核回归（NNK），用于获得更好的稀疏表示的邻域。NNK与信号表示的正交匹配追踪方法相似，并具有良好的几何和理论性质。实验证明了（i）NNK算法在邻域和图构建中的鲁棒性，（ii）NNK在各种应用中优于其他流行的邻域选择方法，以及（iii）NNK在其他机器学习和信号处理任务中的有用性。",
