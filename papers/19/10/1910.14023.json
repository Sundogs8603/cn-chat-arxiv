In this paper we remove the boundedness assumption and, in this more general setting, provide an exact characterization of existence of stationary equilibria, as well as a novel sufficient condition for existence based on treating production as a Lyapunov function.

    "translated_abstract": "在Hopenhayn（1992）的进入退出模型中，生产率是有界的，这意味着预测的企业规模分布无法与数据中可观测到的幂律尾部相匹配。在本文中，我们去除了有界性假设，并在这种更一般的情境下，对平衡态存在的确切特征提供了描述，以及基于将生产视为Lyapunov函数的存在新的充分条件。我们还提供了进入率和总供给的新表示。最后，我们证明在非常广泛的生产率增长设定下，企业规模分布具有幂律尾部。",
