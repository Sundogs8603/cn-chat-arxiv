    "translated_abstract": "最近的半监督异常检测方法使用较少的标记异常样本和大量的未标记数据（大多数为正常数据）进行训练，已经显示在与无监督方法相比可以大幅提高性能。然而，这些方法通常只会关注与给定异常样本对应的异常情况，因此无法泛化到不属于此类情况的新类型/类别的异常情况。为了检测既有已知又有未知的异常情况，我们提出了一种新的深度弱监督方法，称为Pairwise Relation Prediction Network (PReNet)，通过预测任意两个随机抽取的训练实例之间的关系来学习成对的关系特征和异常分数，其中成对的关系可以是异常-异常，异常-未标记或未标记-未标记。由于未标记的实例大多是正常的，这种关系预测强制进行异常-异常、异常-正常和正常-正常的联合学习。",
