    "abstract": "A face spoofing attack occurs when an intruder attempts to impersonate someone who carries a gainful authentication clearance. It is a trending topic due to the increasing demand for biometric authentication on mobile devices, high-security areas, among others. This work introduces a new database named Sense Wax Attack dataset (SWAX), comprised of real human and wax figure images and videos that endorse the problem of face spoofing detection. The dataset consists of more than 1800 face images and 110 videos of 55 people/waxworks, arranged in training, validation and test sets with a large range in expression, illumination and pose variations. Experiments performed with baseline methods show that despite the progress in recent years, advanced spoofing methods are still vulnerable to high-quality violation attempts.",

    "translated_abstract": "面部欺骗攻击是指入侵者试图冒充携带有盈利认证凭据的人。由于移动设备、高安全区域等对生物识别认证的需求增加，这一问题成为一个热门话题。本研究介绍了一个名为Sense Wax Attack (SWAX)的新数据库，包含真实的人类和蜡像图像和视频，用于验证面部欺骗检测问题。该数据集包含1800多张人脸图像和110个55人/蜡像的视频，分为训练集、验证集和测试集，包含大量的表情、光照和姿势变化。通过与基准方法进行的实验表明，尽管近年来取得了一些进展，但高质量的攻击仍然使高级欺骗方法易受攻击。",
