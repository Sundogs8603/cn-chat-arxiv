    "abstract": "This paper shows that black and Hispanic borrowers are 39% more likely to experience a debt collection judgment than white borrowers, even after controlling for credit scores and other relevant credit attributes. The racial gap in judgments is more pronounced in areas with a high density of payday lenders, a high share of income-less households, and low levels of tertiary education. State-level measures of racial discrimination cannot explain the judgment gap, nor can neighborhood-level differences in the previous share of contested judgments or cases with attorney representation. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that closing the racial wealth gap could significantly reduce the racial disparity in debt collection judgments.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文表明，即使在控制了信用评分和其他相关信用属性后，黑人和西班牙裔借款人比白人借款人更有可能遭受债务收集判决。在有大量发薪日贷款机构、没有收入的家庭占比高以及受过高等教育程度低的地区，种族间的判决差距更加明显。州级的种族歧视措施不能解释判断差距，社区级别的争议判决占比或有律师代表的案件之前的差异也不能解释判断差距。一个简单的计算估计表明，缩小种族财富差距可以显著减少债务收集判决的种族差异。",
