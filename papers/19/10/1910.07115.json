    "translated_abstract": "GitHub已经成为一个重要的代码分享和科学交流平台。由于可用的仓库数量庞大，需要基于主题进行搜索。尽管引入了主题标签功能，但大多数GitHub仓库都没有任何标签，限制了搜索和基于主题的分析的效用。本研究将自动仓库分类问题定位为基于关键词的分层分类。具体而言，用户只需提供带有关键词的标签层次结构作为监督。这种设置具有灵活性，能适应用户的需求，考虑到主题标签的不同粒度，并且需要较少的人力投入。我们确定了这个问题的三个关键挑战，即（1）多模式信号的存在；（2）监督稀缺性和偏见；（3）监督格式不匹配。鉴于这些挑战，我们提出了HiGitClass框架，包括三个模块：heterogeneou",
