We present results on the identification of social networks from observational panel data that contains no information on social ties between agents. In the context of a canonical social interactions model, we provide sufficient conditions under which the social interactions matrix, endogenous and exogenous social effect parameters are all globally identified. While this result is relevant across different estimation strategies, we then describe how high-dimensional estimation techniques can be used to estimate the interactions model based on the Adaptive Elastic Net GMM method. We employ the method to study tax competition across US states.

    "translated_abstract": "社会互动决定了很多经济行为，但在大多数公开可用的和广泛使用的数据集中，社交联系的信息是不存在的。我们研究了如何从包含没有关于个体之间社交联系信息的观察面板数据中识别社交网络。在一个经典社会互动模型的背景下，我们给出了全局识别社交互动矩阵、内生和外生社交效应参数的充分条件。虽然这个结果适用于不同的估计策略，我们描述了如何使用高维估计技术来基于自适应弹性网格广义矩估计方法估计互动模型。我们应用了该方法来研究美国各州之间的税收竞争。我们发现，识别出的社交互动矩阵表明税收竞争与地理上相邻州之间的竞争的常见假设存在显著差异，进一步说明了税收竞争的特点。",
