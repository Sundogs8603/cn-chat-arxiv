    "translated_abstract": "经济调查的合理受访者可能会报告任何中心趋势度量（例如均值、中位数、众数或任何凸组合）作为点预测。本文提出了一种在受访者使用的中心趋势度量未知时的预测合理性测试方法。我们克服了当中心趋势度量相等或位于彼此的局部邻域内时（对于（几乎）对称的分布情况），出现的识别问题。作为构建块，我们还提出了对众数预测的新型合理性检验。我们将测试应用于纽约联邦储备银行的消费者预期调查中的收入预测。我们发现这些预测可以作为众数预测合理化，但不可以作为均值或中位数预测合理化。我们还发现在样本分层中，受访者使用的中心度量存在收入、年龄、工作稳定性和过去就业状态的异质性。",
