    "translated_abstract": "提取图像特征的方法是许多图像处理任务的关键。目前，最流行的方法是深度神经网络，它可以通过端到端训练自动提取鲁棒的特征，而不需要手工制作特征提取。然而，深度神经网络当前面临许多挑战：1）它的有效性在很大程度上取决于大型数据集，因此计算复杂度非常高；2）它通常被视为黑匣子模型，解释能力差。为了应对以上挑战，本文提出了一种更具解释性和可伸缩性的特征学习方法，即基于模糊规则的深度图像特征学习（DIFL-FR），该方法结合了基于规则的模糊建模技术和深度堆叠学习策略。该方法通过逐层学习基于模糊规则的图像特征，因此可以通过生成的规则更好地解释特征学习过程。更重要的是，DIFL-FR方法的特征学习与数据集的大小无关，大大降低了计算复杂度。实验结果表明，该方法在几个基准数据集上实现了比其他特征学习方法更好的性能。",
