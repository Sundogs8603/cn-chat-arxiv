    "translated_abstract": "排名聚合算法（RA）用于将来自不同用户的偏好总结成一个总排序。在假设用户同质化的情况下，这项工作基本无误。但在复杂的实际情况下，由于同质假设无法验证，RA的模型错误特化出现了。现有的健壮RA通常采用排名模型扩充来解释额外的噪声，其中收集到的偏好可以被视为单个附加到理想偏好上的扰动。由于健壮闯闯亮RAs大多依赖于某些扰动假设，因此它们不能很好地推广到真实世界中对不确定噪声的偏好。在本文中，我们提出了CoarsenRank，它对模型的错误特化具有鲁棒性。具体而言，我们的CoarsenRank具有以下特性：（1）CoarsenRank是针对轻微的模型错误特化而设计的，假设与模型假设一致的理想偏好位于收集到的偏好的附近。（2）CoarsenRank采用由粗到精的方案来捕捉收集到的来自不同用户的细微差异， 并利用聚类技术。（3）CoarsenRank利用排名空间的几何结构来更好地模拟聚合过程，并进一步增强其鲁棒性。我们进行了广泛的实验，涵盖合成和真实世界的数据集，验证了CoarsenRank的有效性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes CoarsenRank with robustness against model misspecification in rank aggregation (RA), which summarizes a collection of preferences from different users into a total order. CoarsenRank employs a coarse-to-fine scheme to capture global preference information from collected preferences and leverages clustering techniques to account for subtle differences among preferences. Moreover, it exploits the geometry structure of ranking spaces to model aggregation processes and further enhances its robustness. The effectiveness of CoarsenRank is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world datasets."
