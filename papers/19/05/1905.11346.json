    "translated_abstract": "加权A*（wA*）是一种广泛应用于解决计划和搜索问题的快速但次优算法。该算法产生的解的成本被保证不超过最优解成本的W倍，其中W是wA*在优化开放节点时所使用的权重。因此，W是wA*产生的解的次优性边界。普遍认为，这个界限不太准确，wA*解的实际次优性往往远远小于W倍的最优解。然而，支持该观点的出版物很少，也没有现有的解释为什么W是一个很差的界限。本文填补了文献中的这些空白。我们开始进行大规模实验，证明在各种领域和相应的启发式算法中，W往往远远低于wA*解的真实次优性。然后，我们分析性地识别了可能的误差源。最后，我们提出了一种实用方法，纠正了其中两个源的误差，从而获得了更准确的wA*解的次优性边界。",
