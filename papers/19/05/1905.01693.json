    "abstract": "This paper considers incentives to provide goods that are partially shareable along social links. We introduce a model in which each individual in a social network not only decides how much of a shareable good to provide, but also decides which subset of neighbours to nominate as co-beneficiaries. An outcome of the model specifies an endogenously generated subnetwork of the original network and a public goods game occurring over the realised subnetwork. We prove the existence of specialised pure strategy Nash equilibria: those in which some individuals contribute while the remaining individuals free ride. We then consider how the set of efficient specialised equilibria vary as the constraints on sharing are relaxed and we show that, paradoxically, an increase in shareability may decrease efficiency.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究社会联系中部分可共享物品提供的激励机制。我们引入了一个模型，每个社交网络中的个体不仅决定提供多少可共享的物品，还决定提名哪些邻居作为共同受益者的子集。该模型的结果指定了一个原始网络的内生生成子网络和在实现子网络上发生的公共物品博弈。我们证明了专门的纯策略纳什均衡的存在：其中一些个体做出贡献，而其余个体则搭便车。然后，我们考虑当共享约束松弛时专业均衡的有效集合如何变化，并显示出具有讽刺意味的是，可共享性的增加可能会降低效率。",
