Specifically, we study the automatic construction of languages that are maximally flexible while being sufficiently explicative for coordination. To this end, we view language as a machinery for specifying temporal-state constraints of plans. Such a view enables us to reverse-engineer a language from the ground up by mapping these composable constraints to words. Our language expresses a plan for any given task as a \"plan sketch\" to convey just-enough details while maximizing the flexibility to realize it, leading to robust coordination with optimality guarantees among other benefits. We formulate and analyze the problem, provide an approximate solution, and validate the advantages of our approach under various scenarios to shed light on its applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们考虑了协调任务规划机器人中的一个关键环节。具体来说，我们研究了自动构建最大灵活性且足够解释性的语言，用于协调任务规划。为此，我们将语言视为指定计划时间-状态约束的机制。这种看法使我们能够逆向工程地从头开始构建语言，将这些可组合约束映射到词语上。我们的语言将一个给定任务的计划表达为一个“计划草图”，传达足够的细节以最大程度实现灵活性，从而实现稳健协调并具有最优性保证等其他优点。我们制定并分析问题，提供近似解，验证了我们方法的优势在各种场景下，并为其应用提供了启示。",
