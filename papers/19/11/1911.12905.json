    "abstract": "arXiv:1911.12905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: We use reinforcement learning in simulation to obtain a driving system controlling a full-size real-world vehicle. The driving policy takes RGB images from a single camera and their semantic segmentation as input. We use mostly synthetic data, with labelled real-world data appearing only in the training of the segmentation network.   Using reinforcement learning in simulation and synthetic data is motivated by lowering costs and engineering effort.   In real-world experiments we confirm that we achieved successful sim-to-real policy transfer. Based on the extensive evaluation, we analyze how design decisions about perception, control, and training impact the real-world performance.",
