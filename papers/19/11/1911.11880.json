    "translated_abstract": "投资组合管理是金融中涉及对资金和资产进行持续重新配置以满足期望收益和风险配置的艺术与科学。深度强化学习（RL）在投资组合管理中引起了越来越多的关注，其中基于金融数据训练RL代理以优化资产重新配置过程。尽管之前有尝试将RL与投资组合管理相结合，但之前的工作未考虑交易成本或空头限制等实际方面，限制了其适用性。为解决这些限制，我们提出了一个通用的RL框架，用于资产管理，它可以实现连续的资产权重、空头交易以及利用相关特征进行决策。我们比较了三种不同的RL算法的性能：策略梯度与演员-评论家（PGAC），近端策略优化（PPO）和进化策略（ES），并展示了它们在模拟环境中的优势。",
