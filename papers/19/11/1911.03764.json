    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在不同时期内某组数据单元的治疗开始时间存在差异时，对实验进行设计和分析的问题。设计问题涉及选择每个数据单元的初始治疗时间以便最精确地估计治疗的瞬时效应和累积效应。我们首先考虑非自适应实验，其中所有的治疗分配决策都在实验开始之前做出。针对这种情况，我们证明了优化问题通常是NP难的，并提出了一种近似最优解。在该解决方案下，每个时期进入治疗的分数最初较低，然后变高，最后再次降低。接下来，我们研究了自适应实验设计问题，其中在收集每个时期的数据后更新继续实验和治疗分配决策。对于自适应情况，我们提出了一种新算法——精度导向的自适应实验（PGAE）算法，它使用贝叶斯决策理论来最大化估计治疗效果的预期精度。我们证明了PGAE算法达到了悔恨的下限，悔恨定义为期望累计平方标准误差和任意治疗分配策略所能实现的最佳误差之间的差异。",
