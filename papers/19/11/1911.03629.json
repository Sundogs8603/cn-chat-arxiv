    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑生产市场中的Tit-for-Tat动态，其中有一个由加权图连接的n个玩家。每个玩家i可以使用其线性生产函数生产一种以其名字命名的商品，该函数的输入是系统中各种商品的不同数量。在Tit-for-Tat动态中，每个玩家i将其商品按比例分配给上一轮在生产上帮助了玩家i的邻居。我们的贡献是根据图结构表征动态过程的渐进行为，发现只有当玩家具有良好的自循环（即，玩家本身能够良好工作）或者与至少一个其他玩家合作良好时，玩家的财富才会长期增长。我们还考虑了一个广义的阻尼更新，玩家可以以不同的速度更新策略，通过确定给出关于动力系统行为见解的函数，获得了它们增长速度的一个下界。",

Additionally, by considering generalized damped updates, a lower bound on the players' growth rate is obtained."
