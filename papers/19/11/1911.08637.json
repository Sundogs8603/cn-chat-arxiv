    "abstract": "We develop a class of tests for time series models such as multiple regression with growing dimension, infinite-order autoregression and nonparametric sieve regression. Examples include the Chow test and general linear restriction tests of growing rank $p$. Employing such increasing $p$ asymptotics, we introduce a new scale correction to conventional test statistics which accounts for a high-order long-run variance (HLV) that emerges as $ p $ grows with sample size. We also propose a bias correction via a null-imposed bootstrap to alleviate finite sample bias without sacrificing power unduly. A simulation study shows the importance of robustifying testing procedures against the HLV even when $ p $ is moderate. The tests are illustrated with an application to the oil regressions in Hamilton (2003).",

    "translated_abstract": "我们针对时间序列模型，如增长维度的多元回归、无穷阶自回归和非参数筛子回归，开发了一类测试方法。其中包括Chow测试和增长秩$p$的一般线性限制测试。通过采用逐渐增大的$p$渐近理论，我们引入了一种新的尺度校正到传统的测试统计量中，该校正考虑了一个高阶长期方差（HLV），该HLV随着样本大小的增长而产生。我们还提出了一种偏差校正方法，即用零假设引导的bootstrap方法来减轻有限样本偏差，而不会牺牲功率过多。仿真研究表明，即使$p$是适度的，鲁棒化测试程序也很重要。我们通过应用到Hamilton（2003）的油价回归中，说明了这些测试的作用。",
