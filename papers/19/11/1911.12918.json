    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于单模态信号（如脑电信号或外周生理信号）的情绪状态识别模型已取得了令人鼓舞的进展。然而，基于多模态生理信号的情感状态识别方法尚未被充分开发。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于多尺度卷积神经网络（Multiscale CNNs）和仿生决策融合模型的多模态情感状态识别方法。首先，原始信号被与基线信号进行预处理。然后，Multiscale CNNs 中的高尺度CNN和低尺度CNN分别用于 EEG 和每个外周生理信号的情感状态输出概率预测。最后，融合模型通过各种类标签之间的欧氏距离和来自 Multiscale CNNs 的分类概率计算单模态信号的可靠性，并根据其中更可靠的信号进行决策。",
