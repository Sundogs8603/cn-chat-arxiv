    "abstract": "Imitation learning has gained immense popularity because of its high sample-efficiency. However, in real-world scenarios, where the trajectory distribution of most of the tasks dynamically shifts, model fitting on continuously aggregated data alone would be futile. In some cases, the distribution shifts, so much, that it is difficult for an agent to infer the new task. We propose a novel algorithm to generalize on any related task by leveraging prior knowledge on a set of specific tasks, which involves assigning importance weights to each past demonstration. We show experiments where the robot is trained from a diversity of environmental tasks and is also able to adapt to an unseen environment, using few-shot learning. We also developed a prototype robot system to test our approach on the task of visual navigation, and experimental results obtained were able to confirm these suppositions.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于其高样本效率，模仿学习变得极为流行。然而，在实际应用场景中，由于大多数任务的轨迹分布不断变化，仅仅基于连续聚合的数据来进行模型拟合是徒劳的。在某些情况下，分布发生如此大的变化，以至于智能体很难推断出新任务。我们提出了一种新颖的算法，通过对一组特定任务的先前知识进行分配重要权重，从而在任何相关任务上进行泛化。我们展示了一些实验，在这些实验中，机器人从多样化的环境任务中训练，并能够通过少量示范进行学习，从而适应未知环境。我们还开发了一个原型机器人系统，在视觉导航任务上测试我们的方法，并获得了能够验证这些假设的实验证据。",
