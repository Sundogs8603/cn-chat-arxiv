    "abstract": "Online platforms collect rich information about participants and then share some of this information back with them to improve market outcomes. In this paper we study the following information disclosure problem in two-sided markets: If a platform wants to maximize revenue, which sellers should the platform allow to participate, and how much of its available information about participating sellers' quality should the platform share with buyers? We study this information disclosure problem in the context of two distinct two-sided market models: one in which the platform chooses prices and the sellers choose quantities (similar to ride-sharing), and one in which the sellers choose prices (similar to e-commerce). Our main results provide conditions under which simple information structures commonly observed in practice, such as banning certain sellers from the platform while not distinguishing between participating sellers, maximize the platform's revenue.

    "translated_abstract": "在线平台收集有关参与者的丰富信息，然后将其中一些信息与参与者共享，以改善市场结果。在本文中，我们研究了两边市场中的信息披露问题：如果一个平台想最大化收入，应该允许哪些卖家参与平台，并且平台应该与买家分享多少关于参与卖家质量的可用信息？我们将这个信息披露问题研究应用到两种不同的两边市场模型中：一个模型中平台选择价格，卖家选择数量（类似于网约车），另一个模型中卖家选择价格（类似于电商）。我们的主要结果提供了一些条件，当普遍观察到简单的信息结构，比如禁止某些卖家参与平台但不区分参与卖家时，平台的收入最大化。平台的信息披露问题是一个关键且具有实际意义的问题。",
