    "translated_abstract": "随机对偶动态规划是一种用于多阶段随机优化的割平面类型算法，源于30年前。尽管该方法在实践中很受欢迎，但目前尚不存在任何关于该方法收敛速度的分析。本文首先通过引入新颖的数学工具，包括搜索点的饱和性，为解决相对简单的多阶段优化问题的基本动态割平面方法建立了所需的迭代次数，即迭代复杂性。然后，我们进一步精化这些基本工具，针对标准阶段独立性假设下的更一般的多阶段随机优化问题，建立了确定性和随机对偶动态规划方法的迭代复杂性。我们的结果表明，某些确定性算法的复杂度随着阶段数$T$的增加而轻微增加，事实上对于折扣问题是$T$的线性函数。然而，对于随机对偶动态规划，我们发现其迭代复杂度对阶段数有指数依赖性。我们还提供了数值实验以验证我们的理论分析，并展示了确定性对偶动态规划的线性增长确实可能在实践中发生。",
