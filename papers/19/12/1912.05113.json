    "translated_abstract": "多模态聚集，以存在许多城市的形式，主导现代经济地理学。我们专注于多模态聚集体内在实现机制。在具有聚集和分散力量的空间模型中，分散力量的空间尺度（局部或全局）决定了内生空间分布是否变得多峰。只有在全局分散力量（如竞争效应）下，多峰模式才能出现，这些效应引起对远离现有聚集地点的偏离并导致一个单独的聚集。而局部分散力量（如土地的局部稀缺性）会导致现有聚集的平坦化。如果该力量是分散的唯一来源，则产生的空间配置是单峰的。这种观点使我们能够将现有模型分类为三种典型类别：仅具有全局、仅具有本地、以及本地和全局分散力的模型。这种分类有助于模型选择。",
