    "abstract": "We address the problem of estimating the mixing time of a Markov chain from a single trajectory of observations. Unlike most previous works which employed Hilbert space methods to estimate spectral gaps, we opt for an approach based on contraction with respect to total variation. Specifically, we estimate the contraction coefficient introduced in Wolfer [2020], inspired from Dobrushin's. This quantity, unlike the spectral gap, controls the mixing time up to strong universal constants and remains applicable to non-reversible chains. We improve existing fully data-dependent confidence intervals around this contraction coefficient, which are both easier to compute and thinner than spectral counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a novel analysis beyond the worst-case scenario by leveraging additional information about the transition matrix. This allows us to derive instance-dependent rates for estimating the matrix with respect to the induced uniform norm, and some of its mixing propertie",

    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了从单个观测轨迹估计马尔可夫链混合时间的问题。与大多数先前使用希尔伯特空间方法估计谱缺口的工作不同，我们选择采用基于总变差收缩的方法。具体地，我们估计了Wolfer [2020]中引入的收缩系数，受到Dobrushin的启发。与谱缺口不同，这个数量控制着混合时间直到强的普遍常数，并且适用于非可逆链。我们改进了现有的完全依赖数据的置信区间，这些区间比谱相关数量更容易计算且更薄。此外，我们通过利用关于转移矩阵的附加信息，引入了一种超过最坏情况分析的新方法。这使我们能够针对诱导均匀范数和一些混合属性，导出与矩阵估计有关的实例依赖的速率。",
