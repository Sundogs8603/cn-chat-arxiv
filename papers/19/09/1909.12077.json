    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们介绍了Symplectic ODE-Net（SymODEN），这是一个深度学习框架，可以从观测到的状态轨迹中推断出由普通微分方程（ODE）给定的物理系统的动力学。为了在更少的训练样本上实现更好的泛化，SymODEN通过以物理为基础的方式设计相关的计算图，引入适当的归纳偏差。特别地，我们通过设计哈密顿动力学与控制以透明的方式学习潜在动力学，从而可以利用这种动力学来揭示系统的相关物理方面，如质量和势能。此外，我们提出了一种参数化方法，可以在广义坐标数据嵌入到高维空间或者只能访问速度数据而不是广义动量时，也能强制执行这种哈密顿形式。这一框架通过提供可解释的、与物理一致的信息",
