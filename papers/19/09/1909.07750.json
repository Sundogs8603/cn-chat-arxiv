    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了MDP Playground，一个用于强化学习代理的测试平台，可以根据难度的不同维度进行控制，以挑战代理并在玩具和复杂的强化学习环境中获得不同程度的难度。我们考虑并允许对各种维度进行控制，包括延迟奖励、序列长度、奖励密度、随机性、图像表示、无关特征、时间单位、动作范围等。我们通过在OpenAI Gym中变化这些维度来定义一个参数化的快速运行的玩具环境集合，并建议使用这些环境来更好地了解代理。然后，我们展示了如何使用MDP Playground设计实验，以深入了解玩具环境。我们还提供了可以将许多这些维度注入到任何Gym环境中的包装器。我们在Atari和Mujoco上使用这些包装器进行实验，以了解这些维度对比玩具环境更复杂的环境的影响。",
