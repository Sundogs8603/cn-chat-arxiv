    "abstract": "For population studies or for the training of complex machine learning models, it is often required to gather data from different actors. In these applications, summation is an important primitive: for computing means, counts or mini-batch gradients. In many cases, the data is privacy-sensitive and therefore cannot be collected on a central server. Hence the summation needs to be performed in a distributed and privacy-preserving way. Existing solutions for distributed summation with computational privacy guarantees make trust or connection assumptions - e.g., the existence of a trusted server or peer-to-peer connections between clients - that might not be fulfilled in real world settings. Motivated by these challenges, we propose Secure Summation via Subset Sums (S5), a method for distributed summation that works in the presence of a malicious server and only two honest clients, and without the need for peer-to-peer connections between clients.

    "translated_abstract": "在进行人口统计研究或训练复杂机器学习模型时，通常需要从不同的参与者收集数据。在这些应用中，求和是一个重要的基础：用于计算平均值、计数或小批量梯度。在许多情况下，数据是敏感的隐私数据，因此不能在中心服务器上收集。因此，需要以分布式和保护隐私的方式进行求和。现有的具有计算隐私保证的分布式求和解决方案需要信任或连接的假设，例如，存在受信任的服务器或客户之间的点对点连接，这些假设在实际情况下可能无法实现。在这些挑战的驱动下，我们提出了一种称为“S5”的通过子集和实现安全求和的方法，该方法可以在存在恶意服务器和只有两个诚实客户的情况下运行，并且不需要客户之间的点对点连接。 S5在将客户端的消息发送给服务器之前向其添加零和噪声，并且服务器使用子集求和来提取客户端的意图消息，同时抵消噪声。我们的实验证明，与基于同态加密或秘密共享的最新方法相比，S5在实现分布式求和时可以实现更高的准确性，同时达到更低的通信和计算成本。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a new method called Secure Summation via Subset Sums (S5) for privacy-preserving distributed machine learning. S5 works without the need for peer-to-peer connections between clients and can achieve better accuracy and lower communication and computation costs than state-of-the-art methods based on homomorphic encryption or secret sharing."
