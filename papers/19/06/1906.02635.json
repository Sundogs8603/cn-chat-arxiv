    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method for estimating consumer preferences among discrete choices, where the consumer chooses at most one product in a category, but selects from multiple categories in parallel. The consumer's utility is additive in the different categories. Her preferences about product attributes as well as her price sensitivity vary across products and are in general correlated across products. We build on techniques from the machine learning literature on probabilistic models of matrix factorization, extending the methods to account for time-varying product attributes and products going out of stock. We evaluate the performance of the model using held-out data from weeks with price changes or out of stock products. We show that our model improves over traditional modeling approaches that consider each category in isolation. One source of the improvement is the ability of the model to accurately estimate heterogeneity in preferences (by pooling information across categories); ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种用于估计离散选择中消费者偏好的方法，其中消费者在一个类别中选择至多一个产品，但在多个类别中并行选择。消费者的效用对不同类别是可加性的。她对产品属性的偏好以及她对价格的敏感度在不同产品间有所变化，并且在一般情况下在产品间是相关的。我们借鉴了机器学习文献中关于概率模型中矩阵分解的技术，将这些方法扩展到考虑时变产品属性和产品缺货的情况。我们使用含有价格变动或缺货产品的留存数据来评估模型的性能。我们展示了我们的模型相较于考虑每个类别的传统建模方法的改进。模型的改进之一是能够准确估计偏好的异质性（通过跨类别汇总信息）。",
