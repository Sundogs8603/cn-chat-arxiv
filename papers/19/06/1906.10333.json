We provide a principled framework for scaling results from such models by removing these finiteness assumptions. Our sufficient conditions are on the theorem statement only, and not on its proof. This results in short proofs, and even allows to use the same argument to scale similar theorems that were proven using distinctly different tools. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach via examples from both revealed-preference theory and matching theory.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多经济学理论模型都包含有限性假设，虽然这些假设是出于简单性而引入的，但却在分析中发挥了实际作用。我们提供了一个有原则的框架来扩展这些模型的结果，通过去除这些有限性的假设。我们的充分条件仅适用于定理陈述方面，而不是证明。这导致了简短的证明，并且甚至允许使用相同的论证来扩展使用完全不同工具证明的类似定理。我们通过来自启示式理论和匹配理论的示例展示了我们方法的多用途性。",
