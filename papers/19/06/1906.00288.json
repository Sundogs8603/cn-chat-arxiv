We show that even if the treatment has no effect, a 5%-level t-test based on this regression will wrongly conclude that the treatment has an effect up to 16.5% of the time. To fix this problem, researchers should instead cluster standard errors at the pair level. Using simulations, we show that similar results apply to clustered experiments with small strata.",

    "translated_abstract": "在配对实验中，研究人员通常通过将结果回归到治疗指示器和配对固定效应，并在随机化单元层次上聚类标准误差来估计治疗效应。我们表明，即使治疗没有效果，基于该回归的5%水平t检验会错误地得出治疗存在效应的结论，错误率可高达16.5%。为解决这个问题，研究人员应该将标准误差聚类在配对层次上。通过模拟，我们发现类似的结果也适用于具有小层次的聚类实验。",
