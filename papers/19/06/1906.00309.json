    "translated_abstract": "本研究从稀疏贝叶斯学习（SBL）的角度解决了离散信号重建的问题。通常，在SBL框架下使用理想的离散化先验进行贝叶斯推理是不可行的。为了克服这个挑战，我们引入了一种新的离散化先验，以利用感兴趣信号的离散特性的知识。通过将离散化先验集成到SBL框架中，并应用变分贝叶斯推理（VBI）方法，我们设计了一种交替优化算法来共同表征有限字母特征并重建未知信号。当测量矩阵是每个分量的i.i.d.高斯分布时，我们进一步将广义近似信息传递（GAMP）嵌入到基于VBI的方法中，以直接采用理想先验并显著降低计算负担。模拟结果表明，该方法具有显著的性能提高。",
