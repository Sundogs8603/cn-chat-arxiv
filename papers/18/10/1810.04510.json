    "translated_abstract": "靠溅射沉积作薄膜的处理，本质上取决于高能粒子与目标表面的相互作用以及随后的粒子传输。底层物理现象的长度和时间尺度横跨数个数量级。不可能实现跨越所有时间和长度尺度的理论描述。可以特别从基本表面和等离子体过程的良好分离的时间尺度中获得优势。可以从表面模型中计算表面特性，并将其存储于若干典型情况下。随后，可以通过适当的模型界面（例如，解析表达式或查找表）将表面数据提供给气相传输模拟并用于定义插入边界条件。但是，在运行时评估中，维护的表面数据可能证明不足够。在这种情况下，可能通过插值（常见）、外推（在缺乏更好的知识的情况下）或单独调用表面直接模拟 (DSM) 模型来获取缺失数据。本文提出了一种新的机器学习方法，通过从 DSM 数据中学习，在运行时为模型提供缺失的表面信息。所得到的组合模型在各种靶材料和惰性气体中进行了测试。讨论了将该方法推广到更广泛的材料和气体范围内的问题。",
