    "abstract": "This paper describes a fundamental and empirically conspicuous problem inherent to surveys of human feelings and opinions in which subjective responses are elicited on numerical scales. The paper also proposes a solution. The problem is a tendency by some individuals -- particularly those with low levels of education -- to simplify the response scale by considering only a subset of possible responses such as the lowest, middle, and highest. In principle, this ``focal value rounding'' (FVR) behavior renders invalid even the weak ordinality assumption often used in analysis of such data. With ``happiness'' or life satisfaction data as an example, descriptive methods and a multinomial logit model both show that the effect is large and that education and, to a lesser extent, income level are predictors of FVR behavior.  A model simultaneously accounting for the underlying wellbeing and for the degree of FVR is able to estimate the latent subjective wellbeing, i.e.~the counterfactual full-s",

    "translated_abstract": "本文描述了一种在调查人类感受和意见时普遍存在的基本问题，即在数值尺度上引导主观回答。本文还提出了一个解决方案。问题是一些个体（尤其是受教育水平较低的个体）倾向于简化回答尺度，只考虑一部分可能的回答选项，例如最低、中间和最高选项。在原则上，这种“焦点值舍入”（FVR）行为即使在这类数据分析中通常使用的弱序假设下，也使其无效。以“幸福”或生活满意度数据为例，描述性方法和多项Logit模型都表明，这种影响是显著的，并且教育程度，以及在较小程度上的收入水平是FVR行为的预测因素。一个同时考虑到底层福祉和FVR程度的模型能够估计潜在的主观幸福感，即反事实的完全幸福感。",

    "en_tdlr": "This research reveals a fundamental issue in surveys of human feelings and opinions, where individuals tend to simplify response scales, which must be taken into account in analyzing such data. Descriptive methods and a multinomial logit model show that education level and income level are predictors of this behavior. A model considering both underlying wellbeing and the degree of simplification can estimate latent subjective wellbeing."
