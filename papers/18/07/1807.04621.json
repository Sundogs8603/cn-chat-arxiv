    "abstract": "I present a dynamic, voluntary contribution mechanism, public good game and derive its potential outcomes. In each period, players endogenously determine contribution productivity by engaging in costly investment. The level of contribution productivity carries from period to period, creating a dynamic link between periods.

After investing, players decide how much of their remaining money to contribute to provision of the public good, as in traditional public good games. I analyze three kinds of outcomes of the game: the lowest payoff outcome, the Nash Equilibria, and socially optimal behavior. In the lowest payoff outcome, all players receive payoffs of zero. Nash Equilibrium occurs when players invest any amount and contribute all or nothing depending on the contribution productivity. Therefore, there are infinitely many Nash Equilibria strategies. Fin",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种动态的自愿贡献机制的公共物品博弈，并推导了其潜在结果。在每个周期中，玩家通过进行昂贵的投资来内生地确定贡献生产率。贡献生产率从一个时期延续到另一个时期，形成了一种动态联系。投资类似于投资于科技股票，用以生产公共物品，例如国防或清洁环境。在投资之后，玩家决定贡献多少剩余资金用于提供公共物品，就像传统的公共物品博弈一样。本文分析了游戏的三种结果：最低收益结果，纳什均衡和社会最优行为。在最低收益结果中，所有玩家收益为零。当玩家投入任何金额并根据贡献生产率全部或全部不贡献时，纳什均衡发生。因此，存在无穷多的纳什均衡策略。",
