    "abstract": "We develop a new approach for estimating average treatment effects in observational studies with unobserved group-level heterogeneity. We consider a general model with group-level unconfoundedness and provide conditions under which aggregate balancing statistics -- group-level averages of functions of treatments and covariates -- are sufficient to eliminate differences between groups. Building on these results, we reinterpret commonly used linear fixed-effect regression estimators by writing them in the Mundlak form as linear regression estimators without fixed effects but including group averages. We use this representation to develop Generalized Mundlak Estimators (GMEs) that capture group differences through group averages of (functions of) the unit-level variables and adjust for these group differences in flexible and robust ways in the spirit of the modern causal literature.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种在观察研究中估计平均治疗效果的新方法，该方法考虑了未观测到的群体水平异质性。我们考虑了一个具有群体水平无偏性的一般模型，并给出了一些条件，使得聚合平衡统计量——处理和协变量的群体平均值的函数——足以消除群体之间的差异。在这些结果的基础上，我们将常用的线性固定效应回归估计器重新解释为Mundlak形式，即线性回归估计器，而不包括固定效应，但包括群体平均值。我们利用这种表示形式开发了广义Mundlak估计器（GMEs），通过单位水平变量的群体平均值来捕捉群体差异，并以灵活且健壮的方式来调整这些群体差异，符合现代因果文献的精神。",
