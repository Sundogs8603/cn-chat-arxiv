    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了Black-Scholes模型的不流动性扩展中欧洲期权的超对冲问题，其中交易具有瞬时价格影响，并且在到期时，对冲的成本和策略会受到实物或现金结算要求的影响。我们的分析基于几何动态规划的减小有效清算坐标的方便选择。价格影响随着时间的推移而短暂，是乘性的，确保基础资产价格的非负性，同时保持无套利模型。基本的（对数）线性示例是相对价格影响与交易股票数量成比例的Black-Scholes模型，其中对于名义价格的影响，对数价格的瞬时性被建模如同Obizhaeva-Wang \\cite {ObizhaevaWang13}。更一般地，我们允许非线性价格影响和弹性函数。描述最小超对冲价格的粘性解由瞬时哈密顿-雅可比-贝尔曼方程所控制，我们通过基于有限元方法的数值方案解决这个问题。我们显示，对于具有短期和低行权价格的期权，现金结算通常比实物结算效率低。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper addresses the superhedging problem for European options in an illiquid extension of the Black-Scholes model. The analysis considers transactions with transient price impact and the costs and strategies for hedging are affected by physical or cash settlement requirements at maturity. Using a numerical scheme based on a finite element method, the paper solves the transient Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to describe the minimal superhedging price. Results show that cash settlement is generally less cost-efficient than physical settlement for options with short maturity and low strike prices."
