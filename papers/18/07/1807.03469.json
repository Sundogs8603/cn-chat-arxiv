    "translated_abstract": "社区检测是网络研究中最基本的问题之一。随机块模型(SBM)是一种广泛应用的模型，已开发出各种估计方法并揭示了它们的社区检测一致性结果。但是，SBM受到一种假设的限制，即同一社区中的所有节点都是随机等价的，这可能不适用于实际应用。我们引入了一种基于双重协变量调整的随机块模型(PCABM)，即将双重协变量信息合并到SBM中。我们研究了协变量系数和社区分配的极大似然估计值。证明了在适当的稀疏条件下，协变量系数估计和社区分配均一致。介绍了一种带有调整的谱聚类（SCWA），以高效地解决PCABM问题。我们推导了SCWA检测社区的误差界限，证明了算法能够实现精确的社区恢复。数值模拟和实际数据分析表明PCABM优于现有方法。",
    "tldr": "基于SBM模型，双重协变量调整的PCABM模型添加了关于节点间关系的附加信息。SCWA算法对PCABM模型进行了高效求解。模拟实验和实际数据分析表明PCABM模型具有优异的性能和预测能力。",
    "en_tdlr": "Based on SBM model, PCABM model with pairwise covariates adjustment adds additional information about the relationship between nodes. The SCWA algorithm efficiently solves the PCABM model. Simulation and data analysis demonstrate that the PCABM model outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and predictive ability."
