    "translated_abstract": "接收器工作特性（ROC）分析被广泛用于评估诊断系统。最近的研究表明，使用标准交叉验证方法估计ROC曲线下面积（AUC）存在较大偏差。淘汰对比交叉验证（LPO）被证明可以修正这种偏差。然而，虽然LPO可以几乎无偏地估计AUC，但它无法提供绘制和分析ROC曲线所需的数据排序。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新方法，称为淘汰对比交叉验证（TLPO）。该方法通过创建从对比中得出排名的比赛，扩展了LPO的功能，从而为数据提供了排序。TLPO既保留了LPO估计AUC的优势，又可以进行ROC分析。我们使用合成数据和真实世界数据证明了TLPO对于AUC估计与LPO一样可靠，并验证了留一交叉验证在低维数据上的偏差。作为ROC分析的案例研究，我们",
