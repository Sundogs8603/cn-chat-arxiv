    "translated_abstract": "将二元分类推广到多类分类的常用方法是误差纠正码（ECC）。ECC可以通过多种方式进行优化，例如通过使它们正交化。本文在七个不同的数据集上使用三种二元分类器测试了两种正交ECC，并将它们与其他三种多类别方法：1对1、一对其余和随机ECC进行比较。代码中不包含零元素的第一种正交ECC允许使用快速简单的方法来解决概率问题。最近的文献预测，与随机ECC相比，正交ECC始终更准确。不确定性系数（U.C.）的提高范围在0.4-17.5％（绝对值为0.004-0.139），而Brier分数的提高范围在0.7-10.7％。不幸的是，正交ECC很少比1对1更准确。当将方法与逻辑回归配对时，差异最大，正交ECC从未击败过1对1。",
