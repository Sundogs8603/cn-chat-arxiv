    "translated_abstract": "在对估计异质性处理效应的方法进行文献综述时，每种提出的方法都会对干预效应及要明确估计的亚群体做出一系列具有限制性的假设。此外，大部分文献没有提供确定哪些亚群体受影响最大的机制——除了手动检查——并且在确定受影响最大的亚群体时也很少能提供正确性保证。因此，我们提出了Treatment Effect Subset Scan (TESS)，一种新方法，用于发现在随机实验中哪些亚群体最明显地受到处理影响。我们将其作为一个模式检测问题来提出，通过有效地对亚群体进行非参数扫描统计量（条件量化处理效应的一种度量）的最大化来实现。此外，我们还确定了受干预影响最大的分布变化最大的亚群体，同时对于干预效应的影响也做出最小的假设。",

    "en_tdlr": "We propose a new method called TESS for efficiently finding the subpopulation most significantly affected by a treatment in a randomized experiment, without making many assumptions and with guarantees of correctness. We frame this as a pattern detection problem and use a nonparametric scan statistic to identify which subpopulation experiences the largest distributional change due to the intervention."
