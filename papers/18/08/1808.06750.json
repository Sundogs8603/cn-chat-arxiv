    "translated_abstract": "本论文引入了一个统一的框架，称为合作广义形式博弈，它既概括了标准的非合作博弈，又允许比之前的概念如联盟稳定纳什均衡更复杂的联盟形成动力学。该框架的核心是一种新颖的解决方案概念，称为合作均衡系统(CES)。CES在两个重要方面与纳什均衡不同。首先，CES对于单方和多方的“可信”的偏离都是免疫的。其次，与纳什均衡不同，其稳定性依赖于假设非偏离玩家的策略保持不变，CES允许玩家可能重新组合和调整策略以应对偏离。主要结果表明，每个合作广义形式博弈，可能具有不完全信息，都存在一个CES。对于完全信息的游戏，证明是构造性的。这个框架在寡头等各种背景下都是广泛适用的。",
