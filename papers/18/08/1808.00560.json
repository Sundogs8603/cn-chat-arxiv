    "translated_abstract": "频谱混合（SM）核是一种描述复杂模式的通用内核类用于高斯过程（GPs）。本文通过模型压缩和时间相位（TP）调制依赖结构，改进了原始的（SM）核使其具有更好的泛化性能。具体而言，通过采用Bienaymés恒等式，我们通过SM组件之间的交叉协方差来泛化依赖结构。然后，我们提出了一种新的带有依赖结构（SMD）的SM核，通过SM组件之间的交叉卷积。此外，我们通过参数化时间和相位延迟来改善依赖结构的表达能力。该依赖结构在频谱密度、协方差行为和采样路径方面具有清晰的解释。为了丰富SMD的有效超参数初始化、可压缩的SM核组件和稀疏的依赖结构，我们引入了一种新的结构适应（SA）算法。",
