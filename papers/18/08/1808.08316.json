    "abstract": "Measuring entity relatedness is a fundamental task for many natural language processing and information retrieval applications. Prior work often studies entity relatedness in static settings and an unsupervised manner. However, entities in real-world are often involved in many different relationships, consequently entity-relations are very dynamic over time. In this work, we propose a neural networkbased approach for dynamic entity relatedness, leveraging the collective attention as supervision. Our model is capable of learning rich and different entity representations in a joint framework. Through extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves better results than competitive baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "测量实体相关性是许多自然语言处理和信息检索应用的基本任务。之前的研究通常在静态设置和非监督方式下研究实体相关性。然而，现实世界中的实体往往涉及许多不同的关系，因此实体关系随时间变得非常动态。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于神经网络的方法来动态评估实体相关性，利用集体注意力作为监督。我们的模型能够在联合框架中学习丰富而不同的实体表示。通过对大规模数据集的广泛实验，我们证明了我们的方法比竞争基线获得了更好的结果。",
