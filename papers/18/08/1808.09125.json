The bootstrap's consistency is proven for a general class of volatility models and intervals are constructed for the conditional Value-at-Risk. A simulation study reveals that the equal-tailed percentile bootstrap interval tends to fall short of its nominal value. In contrast, the reversed-tails bootstrap interval yields accurate coverage. We also compare the theoretically analyzed fixed-design bootstrap with the recursive-design bootstrap.

    "translated_abstract": "提出了一种针对条件风险价值的两步估计法（Francq和Zako\\\"ian，2015）的固定设计残差自助法。证明了该自助法在一般类别的波动率模型中的一致性，并构建了条件风险价值的区间。模拟研究发现，等尾百分位自助法的区间倾向于低于其名义值。相比之下，反向尾自助法的区间具有准确的覆盖率。我们还将理论分析的固定设计自助法与递归设计自助法进行了比较。结果表明，在平均覆盖率方面，固定设计自助法表现同样良好，但在较小样本中，其区间平均较短。实证应用说明了区间估计的方法。",
