    "translated_abstract": "节点链接图是一种常用的表示图形的方法，可以捕捉个体、企业、蛋白质和电信端点之间的关系。然而，即使对于几百个节点的中等规模数据，节点链接图可能无法传达有关图结构的见解，因为会有视觉混乱。我们提出将映射器构造应用于图形可视化，该构造在拓扑数据分析中是一种流行的工具，能够在保留核心结构的同时，提供对数据的总结的强大理论基础。我们开发了一种针对加权无向图的映射器构造的变种，称为{\\mog}，它生成保持同调性的图形骨架。我们进一步展示了如何通过调整单个参数来实现输入图形的多尺度骨架化。我们提供了一个软件工具，可以实现对这些骨架进行交互式探索，并展示了我们的方法在合成和实际数据上的有效性。",
