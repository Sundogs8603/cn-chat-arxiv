    "abstract": "Click through rate (CTR) prediction is very important for Native advertisement but also hard as there is no direct query intent. In this paper we propose a large-scale event embedding scheme to encode the each user browsing event by training a Siamese network with weak supervision on the users' consecutive events. The CTR prediction problem is modeled as a supervised recurrent neural network, which naturally model the user history as a sequence of events. Our proposed recurrent models utilizing pretrained event embedding vectors and an attention layer to model the user history. Our experiments demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the baseline and some variants.",

    "translated_abstract": "点击率（CTR）预测对于原生广告非常重要，但由于没有直接的查询意图，因此很难。本文提出了一种大规模事件嵌入方案，通过对用户连续事件进行弱监督训练的孪生网络来编码每个用户浏览事件。CTR预测问题被建模为一个监督循环神经网络，自然地将用户历史建模为事件序列。我们提出的循环模型利用预训练的事件嵌入向量和注意层对用户历史进行建模。实验结果表明，我们的模型明显优于基线模型和一些变体。",
