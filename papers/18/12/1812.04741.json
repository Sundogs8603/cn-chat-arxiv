    "translated_abstract": "一个由制造商构建的自主系统，在受制于规范和法律的社会中运作，并与最终用户互动。所有这些参与者都是受到自主系统行为影响的利益相关者。我们解决了如何将这些利益相关者的伦理观点集成到自主系统行为中的挑战。我们提出了一个名为Jiminy的伦理建议组件，它使用规范系统和形式论证技术，以在利益相关者之间达成道德协议。Jiminy通过使用规范系统来代表每个利益相关者的伦理观点，并具有三种解决涉及利益相关者意见的道德困境的方法。首先，Jiminy考虑利益相关者的论证如何关联彼此，这可能已经解决了道德困境。其次，Jiminy将利益相关者的规范系统合并，以便利益相关者的合并专业知识可以解决道德困境。第三，并且最重要的是，Jiminy可以让利益相关者进行论证，以解决道德困境。我们在一个自主车辆的案例研究中展示了Jiminy，并演示了如何将利益相关者的伦理观点集成到自主系统的行为中。",

Jiminy represents the ethical views of each stakeholder by using normative systems and resolves moral dilemmas that involve the opinions of the stakeholders through combining the normative systems, and most importantly, engaging the stakeholders in argumentation. It is demonstrated with a case study of autonomous vehicles."
