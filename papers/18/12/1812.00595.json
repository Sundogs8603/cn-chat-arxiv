    "abstract": "A blockchain replaces central counterparties with time-consuming consensus protocols to record the transfer of ownership. This settlement latency slows cross-exchange trading, exposing arbitrageurs to price risk. Off-chain settlement, instead, exposes arbitrageurs to costly default risk. We show with Bitcoin network and order book data that cross-exchange price differences coincide with periods of high settlement latency, asset flows chase arbitrage opportunities, and price differences across exchanges with low default risk are smaller. Blockchain-based trading thus faces a dilemma: Reliable consensus protocols require time-consuming settlement latency, leading to arbitrage limits. Circumventing such arbitrage costs is possible only by reinstalling trusted intermediation, which mitigates default risk.",

    "translated_abstract": "区块链用耗时的共识协议取代中央交易对手来记录所有权的转移。这种结算延迟减缓了跨交易所的交易，使套利者面临价格风险。相反，非链上结算使套利者面临昂贵的违约风险。我们通过比特币网络和订单簿数据表明，交易所价格差异与高结算延迟期重合，资产流向追逐套利机会，低违约风险交易所间的价格差异较小。因此，基于区块链的交易面临着两难选择：可靠的共识协议需要耗时的结算延迟，导致套利限制。规避此类套利成本仅通过重新安装信任的中介来减轻违约风险。",
