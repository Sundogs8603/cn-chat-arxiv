    "translated_abstract": "我们描述了一种新的CNN子采样技术类别，称为多样抽样，通过子采样层大大增加了特征图保留的信息量。我们的其中一个方法称为方格子采样，能够显著提高现有架构（如DenseNet和ResNet）的准确性，而无需任何额外参数，并且非常显著地提高了某些预先训练好的ImageNet模型的准确性，且无需训练或微调。我们对数据增强的性质有了一些可能的观察，并通过实验证明，粗糙的特征图是影响神经网络在图像分类中性能的瓶颈。",

The checkered subsampling method improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art architectures without additional parameters and even enhances the accuracy of pretrained ImageNet models. The study suggests that coarse feature maps are bottlenecking the performance of neural networks in image classification."
