The paper considers the econometric properties of estimators that utilize projections to reimpose information about the exact model in the form of conditional moments. The resulting estimator efficiently combines the information provided by the approximate law of motion and the moment conditions. The paper develops the corresponding asymptotic theory and provides simulation evidence that tilting substantially reduces the mean squared error for parameter estimates. It applies the methodology to pricing long-run risks in aggregate consumption in the US, whereas the model is solved using the Campbell and Shiller (1988) approximation. Tilting improves empirical fit and results suggest that approximation error is a source of upward bias in estimates of risk aversion and downward bias in the elasticity of intertemporal substitution.",

    "translated_abstract": "模型近似是在估计结构或准结构模型时的常见做法。本文考虑了利用投影重新引入关于确切模型的条件矩的估计量的计量性质。由此产生的估计器有效地结合了近似运动定律和矩条件提供的信息。本文发展了相应的渐近理论，并提供了模拟证据表明，倾斜显著减少了参数估计的均方误差。它将该方法应用于定价美国的总体消费中的长期风险，其中模型使用了 Campbell 和 Shiller (1988) 的近似。倾斜改进了实证拟合，结果表明，近似误差是风险厌恶估计中上升偏差和跨期替代弹性估计中下降偏差的源泉。",
