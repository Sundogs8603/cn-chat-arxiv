    "abstract": "Its numerous applications make multi-human 3D pose estimation a remarkably impactful area of research. Nevertheless, assuming a multiple-view system composed of several regular RGB cameras, 3D multi-pose estimation presents several challenges. First of all, each person must be uniquely identified in the different views to separate the 2D information provided by the cameras. Secondly, the 3D pose estimation process from the multi-view 2D information of each person must be robust against noise and potential occlusions in the scenario. In this work, we address these two challenges with the help of deep learning. Specifically, we present a model based on Graph Neural Networks capable of predicting the cross-view correspondence of the people in the scenario along with a Multilayer Perceptron that takes the 2D points to yield the 3D poses of each person. These two models are trained in a self-supervised manner, thus avoiding the need for large datasets with 3D annotations.",

    "translated_abstract": "多人三维姿势估计具有广泛的应用，但在多视图系统中，由于相机提供的2D信息，需要首先在不同视图中唯一标识每个人物。此外，从多视图2D信息中估计每个人物的三维姿势需要克服噪声和潜在遮挡等挑战。本文通过深度学习解决了这两个挑战，提出了一个基于图神经网络的模型，能够预测场景中人物的跨视图对应关系，并使用多层感知器从2D点生成每个人物的三维姿势。这两个模型在自监督的方式下训练，避免了需要包含3D标注的大型数据集。",
