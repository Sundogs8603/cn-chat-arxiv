    "translated_abstract": "随着深度神经网络(DNN)在自动驾驶和生物识别等安全关键和隐私敏感的应用中越来越多地被部署，了解DNN的容错性质非常重要。之前的工作主要关注的是失效时间(FIT)率和静默数据损坏(SDC)率等指标，用来衡量设备故障的频率。相反，本文着重于在发生瞬态错误的情况下量化DNN的准确性，也就是告诉我们网络在发生瞬态错误时的表现如何。我们称这个指标为弹性准确性(RA)。我们展示了现有的RA形式化基本上是不准确的，因为它错误地假设在硬件瞬态故障下，软件变量(模型权重/激活)具有相等的故障概率。我们提出了一种算法，捕捉了在瞬态故障下DNN变量的故障概率，因此提供了由硬件验证的正确的RA估计。",
