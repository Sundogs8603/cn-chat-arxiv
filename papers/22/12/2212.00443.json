    "translated_abstract": "近期的场景图生成（SGG）框架聚焦于学习图像中多个对象之间的复杂关系。由于消息传递神经网络（MPNN）能够模拟对象与邻近对象之间的高阶相互作用，因此它们是SGG的主导表示学习模块。然而，现有的基于MPNN的框架将场景图视为同质图，这限制了对象之间的上下文感知性，而忽视了关系往往高度依赖于与关系相关联的对象这一事实。本文提出了一种无偏见的异构场景图生成（HetSGG）框架，利用消息传递神经网络捕获关系感知上下文。我们设计了一种新的消息传递层，称为关系感知消息传递神经网络（RMP），它考虑了对象之间的谓词类型，汇总了图像的上下文信息。所提出的HetSGG框架在基准数据集上取得了最新的性能，证明了关系感知消息传递对于SGG的有效性。",
