    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种分析和评估广义规划的新方法，该方法可以解决广泛的相关规划问题。虽然在人工智能领域，广义规划的综合和学习一直是一个长期的目标，但由于对给定广义规划的范围和效用进行分析的方法存在根本差距，这个目标仍然具有挑战性。本文通过开发一个新的概念框架以及证明技术和算法过程来解决这些差距，用于评估广义规划的终止和目标可达性相关属性。我们利用图论的经典结果将广义规划分解为较小的组件，然后利用这些组件推导出层次化的终止论证。这些方法可以用于确定给定广义规划的效用，以及指导广义规划的综合和学习过程。我们提供了理论和实证结果来说明这种新方法的适用范围。",
