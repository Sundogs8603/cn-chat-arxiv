While previous work has made great efforts to model spatio-temporal correlations, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: i) Most models collectively predict all regions' flows without accounting for spatial heterogeneity, i.e., different regions may have skewed traffic flow distributions. ii) These models fail to capture the temporal heterogeneity induced by time-varying traffic patterns, as they typically model temporal correlations with a shared parameterized space for all time periods. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervised Learning (ST-SSL) traffic prediction framework which enhances the traffic pattern representations to be reflective of both spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with auxiliary self-supervised learning paradigms.

    "translated_abstract": "城市范围内在不同时间段对交通流量进行稳健预测在智能交通系统中起着至关重要的作用。尽管先前的工作已经为建模时空相关性做出了巨大努力，但现有方法仍然存在两个关键限制：i) 大多数模型在预测所有区域的流量时没有考虑空间异质性，即不同区域可能具有倾斜的交通流量分布。 ii) 这些模型未能捕捉由于时间变化的交通模式而引起的时间异质性，因为它们通常使用一个共享参数化空间来模拟所有时间段的时间相关性。为解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新的时空自监督学习（ST-SSL）交通预测框架，通过辅助自监督学习范式增强交通模式表示，使其既反映空间异质性又反映时间异质性。",
