    "translated_abstract": "深度学习研究中越来越多的关注点是图神经网络在基于网格的连续介质力学模拟中的应用。大多数这些学习框架操作的是每条边连接两个节点的图。受到有限元方法中数据联通性的启发，我们提出一种通过元素而不是边缘连接节点来构建超图的方法。在这样的节点-元素超图上定义了一种超图消息传递网络，模拟局部刚度矩阵的计算过程。我们将这种方法称为有限元灵感启发的超图神经网络，简称FEIH($\\phi$)-GNN。我们还为该网络构建了旋转等变性，并探索其对于建模非定常流体流动系统的能力。该网络架构在两个常见的基准问题上，即圆柱周围的流体流动和翼型结构中展示了稳定和准确的时间滚动预测。",
