    "translated_abstract": "可解释性人工智能（XAI）是人工智能社区中一个充满活力的研究课题，受到不同方法和领域的越来越多的关注。虽然有很多关于该主题的文章，但XAI仍缺乏共享的术语和框架，无法为解释提供结构上的完整性。在我们的工作中，我们通过提出一个新的解释定义来解决这些问题，该定义是文献中可以找到的综合体。我们认为，解释不是原子性的，而是来自于模型和其输入输出映射的证据，以及人类对这些证据的解释组合而成。此外，我们将解释纳入到真实性（即解释是否是模型内部工作和决策过程的真实描述）和可信度（即解释对用户的说服力）的特性中。使用我们提出的理论框架简化了这些特性的操作，并提供了评估AI模型可解释性的综合方法。我们将该框架应用于生物医学领域，并展示其使得我们能够确定模型决策中最具影响力的输入特征，支持对模型行为的解释。我们相信，我们的贡献将促进可解释性工具和方法的发展，从而推进AI算法在关键领域的可信部署。",
