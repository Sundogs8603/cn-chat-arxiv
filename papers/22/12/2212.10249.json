    "translated_abstract": "大脑皮层的感知处理和学习模型需要高效地为所有区域的突触分配信用。在深度学习中，已知的解决方案是误差反向传播，然而这需要从前馈到反馈路径进行生物上不可行的权重传输。我们介绍了无相位对齐学习（Phaseless Alignment Learning, PAL），一种在分层皮层层次中学习高效反馈权重的生物合理方法。这是通过利用生物物理系统中自然存在的噪声作为额外的信息载体来实现的。在我们的动态系统中，所有的权重都是同时学习的，并且仅使用突触本地可用的信息，始终开启可塑性。我们的方法完全不涉及相位（没有前向和后向传递或相位学习），可以在多层皮层层次中实现高效的错误传播，同时保持生物合理的信号传递和学习。我们的方法适用于广泛的模型类别，并且可以实现实时的高效计算。",
