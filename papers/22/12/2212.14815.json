    "abstract": "The increasingly widespread adoption of large language models has highlighted the need for improving their explainability. We present context length probing, a novel explanation technique for causal language models, based on tracking the predictions of a model as a function of the length of available context, and allowing to assign differential importance scores to different contexts. The technique is model-agnostic and does not rely on access to model internals beyond computing token-level probabilities. We apply context length probing to large pre-trained language models and offer some initial analyses and insights, including the potential for studying long-range dependencies. The source code and an interactive demo of the method are available.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型的广泛采用强调了改善其可解释性的必要性。我们提出了一种新颖的解释技术：上下文长度探测，它基于跟踪模型预测作为可用上下文长度的函数，并允许对不同上下文分配不同的重要性得分。该技术是模型不可知的，不依赖于除计算token级概率之外的模型内部访问。我们将上下文长度探测应用于大型预训练语言模型，并提供了一些初始的分析和见解，包括研究远距离依赖性的潜力。方法的源代码和交互式演示可用。",
