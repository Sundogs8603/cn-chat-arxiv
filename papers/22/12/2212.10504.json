In WebTOD, the dialogue system learns how to understand the web/mobile interface that the human agent interacts with, powered by a large-scale language model.",

    "translated_abstract": "任务导向对话系统主要基于基于槽填充框架的任务导向对话（SF-TOD）框架，在该框架下对话被分解为更小的、可控制的单元（即槽），以完成特定的任务。一系列基于该框架的方法在各种 TOD 基准测试中取得了显著的成功。然而，我们认为当前的 TOD 基准测试局限于代理真实世界情景，当前的 TOD 模型仍有很长的路要走。在这篇观点论文中，我们首先确定了 SF-TOD 系统的当前状态和局限性。之后，我们探讨了 WebTOD 框架，这是建立可伸缩 TOD 系统的另一种方向，当 Web/移动接口可用时可以实现。在 WebTOD 中，对话系统通过大规模语言模型的支持，学习如何理解人类代理与之交互的 Web/移动接口。",
