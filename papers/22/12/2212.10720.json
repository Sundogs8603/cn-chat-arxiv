    "abstract": "Morality in dialogue systems has raised great attention in research recently. A moral dialogue system aligned with users' values could enhance conversation engagement and user connections. In this paper, we propose a framework, MoralDial to train and evaluate moral dialogue systems. In our framework, we first explore the communication mechanisms of morality and resolve expressed morality into three parts, which indicate the roadmap for building a moral dialogue system. Based on that, we design a simple yet effective method: constructing moral discussions between simulated specific users and the dialogue system. The constructed discussions consist of expressing, explaining, revising, and inferring moral views in dialogue exchanges, which makes conversational models learn morality well in a natural manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel evaluation method under the framework. We evaluate the multiple aspects of morality by judging the relation between dialogue responses and human values ",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，对话系统中的道德问题引起了研究人员的极大关注。与用户价值观一致的道德对话系统可以增强对话的参与度和用户连接。在本文中，我们提出了一个框架，MoralDial，用于训练和评估道德对话系统。在我们的框架中，我们首先探讨了道德的交流机制，并将表达的道德分为三个部分，这指明了构建道德对话系统的路线图。基于此，我们设计了一种简单而有效的方法：构建模拟特定用户和对话系统之间的道德讨论。构建的讨论包括在对话交换中表达、解释、修订和推断道德观点，这使得对话模型可以以自然的方式学习道德。此外，我们还提出了一种新颖的评估方法。我们通过判断对话响应与人类价值观之间的关系来评估道德的多个方面。",
