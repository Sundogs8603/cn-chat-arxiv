    "abstract": "A current goal in the graph neural network literature is to enable transformers to operate on graph-structured data, given their success on language and vision tasks. Since the transformer's original sinusoidal positional encodings (PEs) are not applicable to graphs, recent work has focused on developing graph PEs, rooted in spectral graph theory or various spatial features of a graph. In this work, we introduce a new graph PE, Graph Automaton PE (GAPE), based on weighted graph-walking automata (a novel extension of graph-walking automata). We compare the performance of GAPE with other PE schemes on both machine translation and graph-structured tasks, and we show that it generalizes several other PEs. An additional contribution of this study is a theoretical and controlled experimental comparison of many recent PEs in graph transformers, independent of the use of edge features.",

    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络领域的一个目标是让Transformer能够处理图结构数据，尽管他们在语言和视觉任务上取得了成功。由于Transformer最初的正弦位置编码（PE）不适用于图形，因此最近的工作集中于开发基于谱图理论或图形各种空间特征的图PE。 本文引入一种新的图PE——基于加权图遍历自动机的图自动机PE（GAPE），并在机器翻译和图形任务中将其与其他PE方案进行比较，并表明它可以推广到其他PE。该研究的另一个贡献是在独立于边缘特征使用的情况下，对许多最近在图形Transformer中的PE进行理论和控制实验比较。",
