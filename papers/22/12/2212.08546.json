    "abstract": "To simulate bosons on a qubit- or qudit-based quantum computer, one has to regularize the theory by truncating infinite-dimensional local Hilbert spaces to finite dimensions. In the search for practical quantum applications, it is important to know how big the truncation errors can be. In general, it is not easy to estimate errors unless we have a good quantum computer. In this paper we show that traditional sampling methods on classical devices, specifically Markov Chain Monte Carlo, can address this issue with a reasonable amount of computational resources available today. As a demonstration, we apply this idea to the scalar field theory on a two-dimensional lattice, with a size that goes beyond what is achievable using exact diagonalization methods. This method can be used to estimate the resources needed for realistic quantum simulations of bosonic theories, and also, to check the validity of the results of the corresponding quantum simulations.",

    "translated_abstract": "要在基于量子比特或量子位的量子计算机上模拟玻色子，必须通过将无限维局部希尔伯特空间截断为有限维来规范理论。在寻求实际量子应用的过程中，了解截断误差有多大非常重要。通常情况下，除非我们拥有好的量子计算机，否则很难估计误差。本文表明，传统的经典设备采样方法，具体而言是马尔科夫链蒙特卡罗方法可以用现有合理的计算资源解决这个问题。我们以二维格点上的标量场理论为例演示了这个想法，其大小超过了使用确切对角化方法所能达到的范围。这种方法可用于估计实际量子模拟玻色理论所需的资源，并检查对应量子模拟的结果的有效性。",
