    "translated_abstract": "在文本资源上回答复杂问题仍然是一个挑战，特别是在处理自然语言句子中多个实体之间的微妙关系时。为此，像YAGO、DBpedia、Freebase和Wikidata这样的知识库（KB）在过去十年中广泛使用并得到了认可，用于问答（QA）应用。虽然这些知识库提供了结构化的知识表示，但缺乏自然语言来源中的上下文多样性。为了解决这个限制，BigText-QA引入了一种综合的QA方法，能够基于更冗余的知识图（KG）回答问题，该图将结构化和非结构化（即“混合”）知识以统一的图形表示方式组织。因此，BigText-QA能够兼顾两个世界的优势——一个经典的命名实体集合，映射到一个结构化的背景知识库（如YAGO或Wikidata），以及一个从自然语言来源中获取的上下文信息。",
