Questions containing questionable assumptions are challenging because they require a distinct answer strategy that deviates from typical answers for information-seeking questions.

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言中的信息检索问题往往包含有可疑的假设，这些假设可能是错误的或无法验证的。包含可疑假设的问题具有挑战性，因为它们需要与通常的信息检索问题的答案不同的答题策略。例如，问题“玛丽·居里是什么时候发现铀的？”不能像通常的“什么时候”问题一样回答，而是需要解决假设“玛丽·居里发现了铀”。在这项工作中，我们提出了(QA)$^2$（带有可疑假设的问答系统），这是一个包含自然生成的搜索引擎查询的开放领域评估数据集，这些查询可能包含或不包含可疑假设。要在(QA)$^2$上取得成功，系统必须能够检测出可疑假设，并且能够对既包含典型信息检索问题又包含可疑假设的问题产生充分的回答。通过人工评分者的可接受性评估，我们证明了在处理这些问题时系统的性能。",
