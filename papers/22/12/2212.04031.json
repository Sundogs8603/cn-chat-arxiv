    "translated_abstract": "由于在现实世界中具有广泛的应用，例如安全、金融监测和健康风险，已经提出了各种深度异常检测模型，并取得了最先进的性能。然而，除了有效之外，在实践中，从业者还希望进一步了解是什么导致了异常结果以及如何进一步修复它。在这项工作中，我们提出了RootCLAM，旨在从因果的角度实现根本原因定位和异常缓解。特别是，我们将由外部干预引起的异常定义为对正常因果机制的外部干预，并旨在定位具有外部干预的异常特征作为根本原因。此后，我们进一步提出了一种异常缓解方法，旨在推荐针对异常特征的缓解措施，以恢复正常结果，使由因果机制指导的反事实变得正常。在三个数据集上的实验证明，我们的方法可以定位根本原因和缓解异常。",
