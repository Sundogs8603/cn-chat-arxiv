    "translated_abstract": "深度学习分类器提供了基于光学相干断层扫描（OCT）及其血管影像学（OCTA）自动诊断糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）的最准确的手段。这些模型的优势部分归功于包含的隐藏层所提供的复杂性，从而实现了所需任务。然而，隐藏层也使算法输出难以解释。在这里，我们引入了一种基于生成对抗学习的新型生物标志物激活地图（BAM）框架，使临床医生能够验证和理解分类器的决策。一个数据集包括456个黄斑扫描根据当前临床标准被分级为非可转诊或可转诊DR。首先，基于此数据集使用DR分类器来评估我们的BAM。BAM生成框架是通过组合两个U形生成器来设计的，从而为此分类器提供有意义的可解释性。主要生成器是根据可转诊扫描进行训练的。",
