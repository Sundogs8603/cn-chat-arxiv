    "abstract": "Reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence that plays a crucial role in activities such as problem solving, decision making, and critical thinking. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in natural language processing, and there is observation that these models may exhibit reasoning abilities when they are sufficiently large. However, it is not yet clear to what extent LLMs are capable of reasoning. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on reasoning in LLMs, including techniques for improving and eliciting reasoning in these models, methods and benchmarks for evaluating reasoning abilities, findings and implications of previous research in this field, and suggestions on future directions. Our aim is to provide a detailed and up-to-date review of this topic and stimulate meaningful discussion and future work.",

    "translated_abstract": "推理是人类智能的基本方面，在问题解决、决策和批判性思维等活动中发挥着关键作用。近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理方面取得了显著的进展，观察到当这些模型足够大时，它们可能会展现出推理能力。然而，目前尚不清楚LLMs在推理方面的能力到底如何。本文全面阐述了LLMs中推理研究的当前状况，包括提高和诱导这些模型推理的技术、评估推理能力的方法和基准、以及以往研究的结果和意义，同时提出了未来方向的建议。我们的目的是提供一个详细和最新的综述，刺激有意义的讨论和未来的研究。",
