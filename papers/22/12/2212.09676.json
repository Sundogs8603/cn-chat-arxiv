    "translated_abstract": "学术文本常常充斥着行话或专业语言，虽然这种语言可以促进领域内的高效沟通，但会阻碍非该领域人士的理解。本研究开发并验证了一种可解释的方法来测量学术行话。我们拓展了之前关注单词类型的先前研究范围，使用词义归纳还确定了那些在不同领域中含义不同的普遍单词。然后，我们估计了这些学科特定单词和词义在数百个子领域中的普及程度，并表明词义提供了一种补充而独特的行话视角。我们还通过强调两个重要的社会影响，展示了我们的度量方法在科学和计算社会语言学方面的实用性。首先，尽管大多数领域在为面向通用场所撰写作品时会减少其使用行话，但有些领域（例如生命科学）会比其他领域更少。其次，行话的使用方向则呈单向下降趋势。",
