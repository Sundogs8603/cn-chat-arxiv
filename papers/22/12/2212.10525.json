    "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks have been studied for many decades in the speech research community, but have not received as much attention as lower-level tasks like speech and speaker recognition.

Recent work has begun to introduce such benchmark datasets for several tasks. In this work, we introduce several new annotated SLU benchmark tasks based on freely available speech data, which complement existing benchmarks and address gaps in the SLU evaluation landscape. We contribute four tasks: question answering and summarization involve inference over longer speech sequences; named entity localization addresses the speech-specific task of locating the targeted content in the signal; dialog act classification identifies the function of a given speech utterance.

    "translated_abstract": "口语理解（SLU）任务在语音研究领域已经研究了许多十年，但是没有像语音和说话人识别等低层任务一样受到很多关注。特别是，没有多少SLU任务基准评测，并且许多现有的基准评测使用数据并不是所有研究人员都可以自由获取的。最近的一些工作开始为几个任务引入这样的基准评测数据集。在这项工作中，我们基于自由获取的语音数据引入了几个新的注释SLU基准评测任务，这些任务补充了现有的基准评测并填补了SLU评估领域的差距。我们贡献了四个任务：问答和摘要涉及更长的语音序列的推理；命名实体本地化处理定位信号中的目标内容这一语音特定任务；对话行为分类确定给定语音话语的功能。我们遵循口语语言理解评估（SLUE）第一阶段的蓝图，设计跨越不同应用领域和使用不同语言技术的多样化任务。我们希望我们的SLUE Phase-2基准评测可以鼓励进一步研究和开发SLU技术，从而推动口语理解技术的发展。",
