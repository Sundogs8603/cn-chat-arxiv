Detecting hateful memes is challenging, one of the reasons being the evolutionary nature of memes; new hateful memes can emerge by fusing hateful connotations with other cultural ideas or symbols. In this paper, we propose a framework that leverages multimodal contrastive learning models, in particular OpenAI's CLIP, to identify targets of hateful content and systematically investigate the evolution of hateful memes. We find that semantic regularities exist in CLIP-generated embeddings that describe semantic relationships within the same modality (images) or across modalities (images and text). Leveraging this property, we study how hateful memes are created by combining visual elements from multiple images or fusing textual information with a hateful image.

    "translated_abstract": "在社交媒体平台和现实世界中，恶意模因的传播对社会产生了不良影响。检测恶意模因是一项具有挑战性的任务，其中一个原因是模因的演化性质；新的恶意模因可以通过将恶意内涵与其他文化观念或符号融合而出现。本文提出了一个框架，利用多模式对比学习模型（特别是OpenAI的CLIP）来识别恶意内容的目标，并系统地研究恶意模因的演化。我们发现CLIP生成的嵌入向量中存在语义规律，描述了同一模态（图像）或跨模态（图像和文本）之间的语义关系。利用这一属性，我们研究了如何通过结合多个图像的可视化元素或将文本信息与恶意图像融合来创建恶意模因。通过重点研究反犹太主义模因，我们展示了我们的框架分析恶意模因演化的能力。",
