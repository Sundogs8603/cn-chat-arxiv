    "abstract": "The success of deep learning requires high-quality annotated and massive data. However, the size and the quality of a dataset are usually a trade-off in practice, as data collection and cleaning are expensive and time-consuming. In real-world applications, especially those using crowdsourcing datasets, it is important to exclude noisy labels. To address this, this paper proposes an automatic noisy label detection (NLD) technique with inconsistency ranking for high-quality data. We apply this technique to the automatic speaker verification (ASV) task as a proof of concept. We investigate both inter-class and intra-class inconsistency ranking and compare several metric learning loss functions under different noise settings. Experimental results confirm that the proposed solution could increase both the efficient and effective cleaning of large-scale speaker recognition datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习的成功需要高质量的注释和大规模数据，然而实际中，数据集的大小和质量往往存在一个权衡，因为数据的收集和清洗费用高昂且耗时。在使用众包数据集的实际应用中，特别是需要排除噪声标签。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种基于不一致性排名的自动无噪声标签检测技术，将其用于自动语音识别（ASV）任务作为概念验证。我们研究了类间和类内不一致性排名，并在不同的噪声设置下比较了几种度量学习损失函数。实验结果表明，该解决方案可以提高大规模说话人识别数据集的高效清洗能力。",
