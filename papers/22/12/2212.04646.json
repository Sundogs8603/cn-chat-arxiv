This work investigates backward reachability as a framework for providing collision avoidance guarantees for systems controlled by neural network (NN) policies. Because NNs are typically not invertible, existing methods conservatively assume a domain over which to relax the NN, which causes loose over-approximations of the set of states that could lead the system into the obstacle (i.e., backprojection (BP) sets). To address this issue, we introduce DRIP, an algorithm with a refinement loop on the relaxation domain, which substantially tightens the BP set bounds. Furthermore, we introduce a formulation that enables directly obtaining closed-form representations of polytopes to bound the BP sets tighter than prior work, which required solving linear programs and using hyper-rectangles. Furthermore, this work extends the NN relaxation algorithm to handle polytope domains, which further tightens the bound",

    "translated_abstract": "数据驱动控制技术的安全认证仍然是一个主要的开放性问题。本文研究逆向可达性作为一个框架，为被神经网络 (NN) 策略控制的系统提供避碰保证。由于 NN 通常不可逆，现有方法保守地假定一个域来松弛 NN，这导致状态集的过度逼近，可能导致系统进入障碍物 (即反投影 (BP) 集)。为了解决这个问题，我们引入 DRIP，一个在松弛域上进行精化循环的算法，可以大大收紧 BP 集的边界。此外，我们引入一个公式，可以直接获得用于限制 BP 集的多面体闭合形式表示，比以前需要求解线性规划和使用超矩形的方法更为紧凑。此外，本研究将 NN 松弛算法扩展到处理多面体域，进一步收紧边界。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes the DRIP algorithm, which uses domain refinement iteration with polytopes to improve the accuracy of neural feedback loop backward reachability analysis, which further tightens the edges of the backprojection set. Additionally, a new formulation is introduced to represent the polytope edges for better edge restrictions."
