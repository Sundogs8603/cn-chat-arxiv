    "abstract": "Privacy policies provide individuals with information about their rights and how their personal information is handled. Natural language understanding (NLU) technologies can support individuals and practitioners to understand better privacy practices described in lengthy and complex documents. However, existing efforts that use NLU technologies are limited by processing the language in a way exclusive to a single task focusing on certain privacy practices. To this end, we introduce the Privacy Policy Language Understanding Evaluation (PLUE) benchmark, a multi-task benchmark for evaluating the privacy policy language understanding across various tasks. We also collect a large corpus of privacy policies to enable privacy policy domain-specific language model pre-training. We evaluate several generic pre-trained language models and continue pre-training them on the collected corpus. We demonstrate that domain-specific continual pre-training offers performance improvements across all tasks",

    "translated_abstract": "隐私政策向个人提供其权利以及如何处理与之相关的个人信息的信息。自然语言理解(NLU)技术可以帮助人们理解长且复杂的文档中描述的隐私实践。然而，现有的NLU技术在处理语言时存在一定的局限性，仅专注于特定的隐私实践任务。因此，我们引入了隐私政策语言理解评估(PLUE)基准，这是一个多任务基准，用于评估不同任务中的隐私政策语言理解。我们还收集了大量的隐私政策语料库，以支持隐私政策领域特定语言模型的预训练。我们评估了几种通用的预训练语言模型，并对其进行了收集的语料库的持续预训练。我们证明了领域特定的持续预训练在所有任务中都可以提高性能。",
