    "translated_abstract": "基于自动机的任务知识表示在控制和规划序列决策问题中扮演着重要角色。然而，获取构建此类自动机所需的高层次任务知识通常很困难。同时，大规模自动生成语言模型可以自动生成相关任务知识。然而，自动生成语言模型的文本输出不能正式验证或用于顺序决策。我们提出了一个名为GLM2FSA的新算法，它从任务目标的简短自然语言描述中构建一个编码高层次任务知识的有限状态自动机（FSA）。GLM2FSA首先向GLM发送查询以提取文本形式的任务知识，然后它建立一个FSA来表示这种基于文本的知识。因此，所提出的算法填补了自然语言任务描述和自动机表示之间的差距，构建的FSA可以针对用户定义的规格进行正式验证。",
