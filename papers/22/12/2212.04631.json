    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于阿尔弗雷德·雷尼（Alfr\\'ed R\\'enyi）的功能方法论，通过对两个连续随机过程（r.p.）之间的统计依赖关系进行新颖的多变量定义。将随机过程样本对的互信息的对数论证命名为规范化交叉密度（NCD），定义了一种对称和自伴的正定函数。我们证明，最大化交替协方差估计（ACE）递归应用于输入样本对的联合概率密度，符合雷尼的最大相关性的所有性质。我们提出了NCD的特征谱作为一种新颖的多变量度量，用于衡量输入和输出r.p.之间的统计依赖关系。利用r.p.的实现，也可以直接估计多变量统计依赖性。提出的功能最大相关算法（FMCA）应用于由两个神经网络构建的机器学习架构上，通过逼近联合训练来同时学习。",
