    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，一种在非参数检验问题中广受欢迎的方法是基于概率分布的再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHS）嵌入的概念来处理一般（即非欧几里得）域上的问题。我们工作的主要目标是理解基于这种方法构建的双样本检验的最优性。首先，我们展示了流行的最大均值差异（MMD）双样本检验在Hellinger距离下的分离边界方面并不是最优的。其次，我们提出了一种基于谱正则化的MMD检验修改方法，通过考虑协方差信息（MMD检验无法捕获），证明了所提出的检验具有比MMD检验更小的分离边界的极小极大最优性。第三，我们提出了上述检验的自适应版本，其中涉及一种数据驱动策略来选择正则化参数，并展示了自适应检验几乎是最优的。",
