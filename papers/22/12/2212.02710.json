    "translated_abstract": "理解对象是人工智能的核心，特别是对于具有体验的人工智能而言。虽然深度学习在对象识别方面表现出色，但当前机器仍然难以学习更高层次的知识，例如对象具有哪些属性，以及我们能够使用对象做什么。在本文中，我们提出了一项具有挑战性的 Object Concept Learning (OCL) 任务，以推动对象理解的发展。它要求机器推理出对象的作用，并同时给出原因：是哪些属性使得一个对象具有这些作用。为了支持 OCL，我们构建了一个密集注释的知识库，包括三个层次的对象概念（类别、属性、作用），以及三个层次的因果关系。通过分析 OCL 的因果结构，我们提出了一种基线：Object Concept Reasoning Network (OCRN)。它利用因果干预和概念实例化来推断三个层次，遵循它们之间的因果关系。",
