    "translated_abstract": "数据增强是机器学习中广泛使用以提高模型性能的技术。然而，现有的自然语言理解数据增强技术可能无法完全捕捉到自然语言的复杂变化，并且在大型数据集中应用起来具有挑战性。本文提出了一种新颖的数据增强技术——随机位置噪声（RPN）算法，它在词向量级别上进行操作。RPN通过根据选定词向量的现有值引入噪声修改原始文本的词嵌入，允许更细粒度的修改并更好地捕捉自然语言变化。与传统的数据增强方法不同，RPN不需要计算图中的梯度来进行虚拟样本更新，使其更容易应用于大型数据集。实验结果表明，在各种自然语言理解任务中，包括情感分析等，RPN始终优于现有数据增强技术。",
