    "translated_abstract": "自从反向传播（BP）不被认为是符合生物学原理的以来，生物启发式学习近年来变得越来越流行。文献中提出了许多算法，它们都比BP更符合生物学原理。然而，除了克服BP的生物学不合理性，使用生物启发式算法的强烈动机仍然缺乏。在本研究中，我们进行了BP和多个生物启发式算法的全面比较，以回答生物学习是否比BP提供额外的好处的问题。我们使用不同的设计选择来测试生物算法，如仅使用部分训练数据、训练时资源约束、神经网络参数的稀疏化以及向输入样本添加噪声。通过这些实验，我们发现了两个生物算法超过BP的关键优势。首先，在未提供整个训练数据集时，生物算法比BP表现要好得多。",
