    "translated_abstract": "作为传粉媒介，昆虫在生态系统管理和全球粮食生产中起着至关重要的作用。然而，昆虫数量正在下降，需要高效的昆虫监测方法。现有的方法通过分析昆虫在自然环境中的视频或时间演进图像来进行，但由于昆虫是复杂动态场景中的小物体，分析变得具有挑战性。本研究提供了一个数据集，包括夏季两个月期间三种不同植物物种上的107,387个经过标注的时间演进图像，其中包含9,423个标注昆虫。我们提出了一种用于检测时间演进RGB图像中昆虫的方法流程。该流程由两个步骤组成。首先，对时间演进RGB图像进行预处理，以增强图像中的昆虫。该基于运动信息的增强技术使用运动和颜色来增强图像中的昆虫。然后，将增强后的图像输入到卷积神经网络进行检测。",
