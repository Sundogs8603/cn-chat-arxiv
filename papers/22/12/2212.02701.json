    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习模型的广泛应用，研究在敏感数据上训练的模型可能泄漏数据的潜在问题变得至关重要。最近，提出了各种成员推理 (MI) 攻击来确定样本是否属于训练集。问题在于这些攻击是否可靠地应用于实践。我们展示了MI模型经常将附近的非成员样本误分类为成员，并在可以识别到的确切成员样本的子种群上具有高误报率。我们还展示了MI攻击的实际应用，其中这个问题对真实世界产生了影响。在这里，MI攻击被外部审计师（调查员）用来向法官/陪审团展示被审计人非法使用敏感数据。由于MI攻击在成员的子种群上具有高假阳性率，被审计人通过揭示MI攻击的性能来挑战审计师的可信度。我们的结果表明，MI攻击不可靠，应谨慎使用。",
