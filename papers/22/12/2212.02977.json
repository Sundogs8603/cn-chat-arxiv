    "abstract": "Scenario-based probabilistic forecasts have become vital for decision-makers in handling intermittent renewable energies. This paper presents a recent promising deep learning generative approach called denoising diffusion probabilistic models. It is a class of latent variable models which have recently demonstrated impressive results in the computer vision community. However, to our knowledge, there has yet to be a demonstration that they can generate high-quality samples of load, PV, or wind power time series, crucial elements to face the new challenges in power systems applications. Thus, we propose the first implementation of this model for energy forecasting using the open data of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014. The results demonstrate this approach is competitive with other state-of-the-art deep learning generative models, including generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and normalizing flows.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于情景的概率预测对于决策者在处理间歇性可再生能源方面至关重要。本文提出了一种称为去噪扩散概率模型的深度学习生成方法，它是一类潜变量模型，在计算机视觉领域最近表现出了惊人的结果。然而，据我们所知，尚未有演示它们可以生成高质量的负荷、光伏或风力时间序列样本，而这是应对电力系统应用中的新挑战所必需的关键要素。因此，我们提出了这种模型在利用全球能源预测大赛2014的公开数据进行能源预测的首次实现。结果表明，这种方法与其他最先进的深度学习生成模型（包括生成对抗网络、变分自动编码器和正常化流）具有竞争力。",
