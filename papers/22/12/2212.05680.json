    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型容易受到对抗扰动的影响。其中一种著名的攻击方式是对抗贴纸，这是一种带有特定图案的贴纸，使得模型在贴纸所贴物体上的预测错误。这种攻击对于依赖于摄像头的物理系统，如自动驾驶汽车，构成了严重威胁。尽管问题的重要性，但在真实环境中进行研究是困难的；在真实世界中评估攻击和防御策略成本高昂，而合成数据则不够真实。在本文中，我们提出了REAP（真实对抗贴纸）基准测试，这是一个数字基准测试，允许用户在真实图像和真实环境条件下评估对抗贴纸攻击。基于Mapillary Vistas数据集，我们的基准测试包含超过14,000个交通标志。每个标志都经过几何和光照变换的改变，这可以用来将数字生成的贴纸真实地应用到图像中。",
