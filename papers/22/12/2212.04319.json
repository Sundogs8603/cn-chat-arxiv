    "translated_abstract": "条件归一化流可以生成各种图像样本以解决成像逆问题。大多数用于成像逆问题的归一化流采用可变换仿射耦合层，可以快速生成各种图像，但偶尔会观察到意外的严重伪像。本文通过研究这些伪像的来源并提出避免它们的条件来解决这个关键问题。我们首先通过经验和理论揭示了这些问题是由于某些超出分布范围的条件输入中的条件仿射耦合层“爆炸反演”所造成的。然后，我们进一步验证，在成像逆问题中，导致像素错误伪像的概率与以Mahalanobis距离为基础的逆问题的异常样本评分高度相关。最后，在我们的调查基础上，我们提出了一条注释以避免“爆炸反演”，然后基于此，我们建议一种简单的解决方法，用其他可变换仿射耦合层替换某些耦合层。",
