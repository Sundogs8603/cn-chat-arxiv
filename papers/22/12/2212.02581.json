    "translated_abstract": "先前的研究表明，男性和女性在表达自信程度上存在差异，尽管通常认为这些差异是天生的或在早期童年时期学习的。本文选取学术出版作为研究对象，发现男性和女性作者在学术手稿的初稿中使用的语言差异最初可以忽略不计：男女作者在初稿中的表达不确定性的程度相似。然而，在追踪这些早期手稿到其出版版本时，就会出现相当大的性别差距。也就是说，女性在出版过程中增加了使用小心谨慎语言的程度。我们展示了这种语言性别差距的增加在很大程度上取决于编辑的分配。具体而言，我们的作者匹配到编辑的数据集允许我们估计编辑特定的固定效应，捕捉特定编辑对女性作者相对于男性作者在语言不确定性方面的影响（编辑的作者性别差距）。",
