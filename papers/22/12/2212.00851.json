    "abstract": "arXiv:2212.00851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: The widespread of offensive content online, such as hate speech and cyber-bullying, is a global phenomenon. This has sparked interest in the artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) communities, motivating the development of various systems trained to detect potentially harmful content automatically. These systems require annotated datasets to train the machine learning (ML) models. However, with a few notable exceptions, most datasets on this topic have dealt with English and a few other high-resource languages. As a result, the research in offensive language identification has been limited to these languages. This paper addresses this gap by tackling offensive language identification in Sinhala, a low-resource Indo-Aryan language spoken by over 17 million people in Sri Lanka. We introduce the Sinhala Offensive Language Dataset (SOLD) and present multiple experiments on this dataset. SOLD is a manuall",

    "translated_abstract": "在线攻击性内容的普遍存在，比如仇恨言论和网络欺凌，已成为全球性现象。这引起了人工智能（AI）和自然语言处理（NLP）社区的兴趣，促使开发各种系统，能够自动检测潜在有害内容。然而，除了少数几个例外情况外，大多数关于这一主题的数据集都处理英语和少数其他高资源语言。因此，攻击性语言识别研究一直局限于这些语言。本文通过处理僧伽罗语攻击性语言识别来填补这一空白，僧伽罗语是斯里兰卡有超过1700万人口使用的低资源印欧语言。我们介绍了僧伽罗语攻击性语言数据集（SOLD），并在该数据集上展示了多个实验。",
