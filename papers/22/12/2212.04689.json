    "translated_abstract": "解决偏微分方程是困难的。最近提出了神经分辨率不变模型，尽管它们有效和高效，但通常需要等间隔的数据点。然而，在实际系统的空间域中采样有时不可避免地是非等间隔的，从而限制了它们的适用性。在本文中，我们提出了一种带有自适应插值的非等间隔傅里叶PDE求解器（\\textsc {NFS}）和傅里叶神经算子的变体作为其组成部分。对复杂PDE进行的实验结果表明，它在精度和效率方面具有优势。与空间等间隔基准方法相比，它在MAE上取得了$42.85\\%$的改进，并且能够在略有精度损失的情况下处理非等间隔数据。此外，据我们所知，\\textsc{NFS}是第一个具有网格不变推断能力的基于机器学习的方法，在非等间隔场景下成功模拟湍流流动。",
