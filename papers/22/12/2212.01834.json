    "translated_abstract": "传统 AI 伦理的一个反对意见是它会减缓创新。本文回应了这一观点，把伦理重新构建成一个创新加速器。关键元素来自稳定 AI 的扩散和 OpenAI 的 Dall-E 之间的对比。通过分析它们所支持的开发和部署战略背后的不同价值观，识别出五个概念作为加速伦理的共同点。不确定性被理解为积极和鼓励性的，而不是有所遏制。创新被认为是内在有价值的，而不仅仅是通过社会影响才有价值。AI 问题通过更多的 AI 来解决，而不是更少。控制 AI 的许可和限制来自分散的过程，而不是统一的权威。伦理的工作是嵌入在 AI 的开发和应用中，而不是从外部发挥作用。这些态度和做法共同使伦理成为激励人工智能，而不是制约它的力量。",
    "tldr": "本文主张将AI伦理重新构建成一个创新加速器。通过分析稳定AI与OpenAI的对比，总结出五个加速AI的共同点，即将不确定性看作积极因素，将创新视为内在价值，采用更多AI解决AI问题，采用分散的过程控制AI的许可和限制，并将伦理合并到AI的开发和应用中。这些做法使伦理成为一个激励AI创新的力量。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes to rebuild AI ethics as an innovation accelerator by analyzing the contrasting strategies of Stability AI’s Diffusion and OpenAI’s Dall-E. The five common points of acceleration ethics are identified, which view uncertainty as positive, value innovation as an intrinsic value, solve AI problems with more AI, govern AI through a decentralized process, and embed ethics in AI development and application. These attitudes and practices make ethics a motivating force for AI innovation."
