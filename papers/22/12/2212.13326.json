    "abstract": "Our aim is to build autonomous agents that can solve tasks in environments like Minecraft. To do so, we used an imitation learning-based approach. We formulate our control problem as a search problem over a dataset of experts' demonstrations, where the agent copies actions from a similar demonstration trajectory of image-action pairs. We perform a proximity search over the BASALT MineRL-dataset in the latent representation of a Video PreTraining model. The agent copies the actions from the expert trajectory as long as the distance between the state representations of the agent and the selected expert trajectory from the dataset do not diverge. Then the proximity search is repeated. Our approach can effectively recover meaningful demonstration trajectories and show human-like behavior of an agent in the Minecraft environment.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在建立能够解决像Minecraft这样环境中任务的自主智能体。为此，我们使用了基于模仿学习的方法。我们将控制问题表述为基于专家演示数据集的搜索问题，其中代理从类似于图像-动作对的演示轨迹中复制动作。我们在视频预训练模型的潜表示中对BASALT MineRL数据集进行了近邻搜索。只要代理和数据集中选定的专家轨迹的状态表示之间的距离不会分散，代理就会复制专家轨迹中的动作。然后重新进行近邻搜索。我们的方法可以有效地恢复有意义的演示轨迹，并在Minecraft环境中展示出类似于人类的行为。",
