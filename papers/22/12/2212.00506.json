    "abstract": "In cooperative Multi-Agent Planning (MAP), a set of goals has to be achieved by a set of agents. Independently of whether they perform a pre-assignment of goals to agents or they directly search for a solution without any goal assignment, most previous works did not focus on a fair distribution/achievement of goals by agents. This paper adapts well-known fairness schemes to MAP, and introduces two novel approaches to generate cost-aware fair plans. The first one solves an optimization problem to pre-assign goals to agents, and then solves a centralized MAP task using that assignment. The second one consists of a planning-based compilation that allows solving the joint problem of goal assignment and planning while taking into account the given fairness scheme. Empirical results in several standard MAP benchmarks show that these approaches outperform different baselines. They also show that there is no need to sacrifice much plan cost to generate fair plans.",

    "translated_abstract": "在协作的多智能体规划中，一组智能体需要完成一组目标。无论是在目标分配之前还是直接搜索解决方案，大多数先前的作品都没有关注智能体之间目标的公平分配/完成。本文将众所周知的公平性方案应用于多智能体规划，并介绍了两种生成考虑成本的公平计划的新方法。第一种方法通过解决优化问题来对智能体进行目标预分配，然后使用该分配来解决集中式多智能体规划任务。第二种方法是一种以计划为基础的编译方法，允许同时解决目标分配和规划的联合问题，同时考虑给定的公平性方案。在多个标准多智能体规划基准测试中的实证结果表明，这些方法优于不同的基线。他们还表明，生成公平计划不需要牺牲太多的计划成本。",
