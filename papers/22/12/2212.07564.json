    "translated_abstract": "由于递归数值解的高昂代价，替代模型对于优化物理动力学中的有意义数量是必要的。特别是对于液体动力学和纳维-斯托克斯方程的计算。然而，尽管数据驱动模型的快速增长，代表真实世界现象的参考数据集仍然缺乏。在这项工作中，我们开发了AirfRANS，在亚音速区域的二维不可压可稳定雷诺平均纳维-斯托克斯方程上，对不同攻击角的翼型进行研究的数据集。我们还介绍了应力力量在几何表面和边界层上的度量方法和可视化来评估模型准确预测问题的关键信息的能力。最后，我们提出了在四个机器学习任务上对AirfRANS进行深度学习基线研究，以研究在不同约束下AirfRANS的泛化考虑。",
