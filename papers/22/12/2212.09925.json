    "translated_abstract": "基于机器学习的蛋白质工程的一个长期目标是加速发现改善已知蛋白质功能的新突变。我们引入了一种采样框架来在模拟中进化蛋白质，支持混合和匹配各种无监督模型(如蛋白质语言模型) 和从序列预测蛋白质功能的监督模型。通过组合这些模型，我们旨在提高评估未见过的突变的能力，并将搜索限制在可能包含功能蛋白的序列空间区域内。我们的框架通过在离散蛋白质空间中直接构建专家分布来实现这一点，而无需任何模型微调或重新训练。我们引入了一个快速的MCMC采样器，使用梯度来提出有前途的突变，而不是使用典型的定向进化方法中的暴力搜索或随机采样。我们在广泛的适应性空间上进行了模拟定向进化实验。",
