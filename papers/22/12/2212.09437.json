    "abstract": "Today's software is bloated with both code and features that are not used by most users. This bloat is prevalent across the entire software stack, from the operating system, all the way to software backends, frontends, and web-pages. In this paper, we focus on analyzing and quantifying bloat in machine learning containers. We develop MMLB, a framework to analyze bloat in machine learning containers, measuring the amount of bloat that exists on the container and package levels. Our tool quantifies the sources of bloat and integrates with vulnerability analysis tools to evaluate the impact of bloat on container vulnerabilities. Through experimentation with 15 machine learning containers from Tensorflow, Pytorch, and NVIDIA, we show that bloat is a significant issue, accounting for up to 80% of the container size in some cases. Our results demonstrate that bloat significantly increases the container provisioning time by up to 370% and exacerbates vulnerabilities by up to 99%.",

    "translated_abstract": "当今的软件代码和功能冗余，并大多数用户并不使用。这种臃肿占据整个软件栈，从操作系统到后端、前端和网页都普遍存在。本文重点分析和量化机器学习容器中的臃肿问题。我们开发了MMLB框架来分析机器学习容器的臃肿，测量容器和软件包的臃肿程度。该工具量化了臃肿的来源，并与漏洞分析工具集成，以评估臃肿对容器漏洞的影响。通过对Tensorflow、Pytorch和NVIDIA的15个机器学习容器进行实验，我们发现臃肿是一个重要问题，在某些情况下占容器总大小的80%。我们的结果表明，臃肿显著增加了容器的供应时间，最多增加了370％，并导致漏洞恶化，最高达99％。",
