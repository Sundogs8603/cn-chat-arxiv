    "translated_abstract": "本文在基本的风险四方理论的背景下研究了支持向量回归（SVR），该理论将优化、风险管理和统计估计联系起来。研究结果表明，SVR的两种形式，$\\varepsilon$-SVR和$\\nu$-SVR，都对应于等效误差度量（分别为Vapnik误差和CVaR范数）的最小化，同时加上正则化惩罚项。这些误差度量又定义了相应的风险四方框。通过构造与SVR对应的基本风险四方框，我们证明了SVR是两个对称条件分位数的平均数的渐近无偏估计量。此外，我们在一般随机环境中证明了$\\varepsilon$-SVR和$\\nu$-SVR的等价性。此外，SVR被表述为带有正则化惩罚项的正则偏离最小化问题。最后，推导了在风险四方框架中的SVR的对偶形式。",
