    "translated_abstract": "多目标最短路径问题(MO-SPP)通常在图上提出，它确定了一组从起始顶点到目标顶点的路径，同时优化多个目标。一般来说，不存在一条路径能够同时优化所有目标，因此该问题旨在寻找一组所谓的 Pareto-最优解。为了解决这个问题，最近开发了几种多目标 A* (MOA*) 算法来快速计算具有质量保证的解。然而，这些 MOA* 算法在内存使用方面经常存在问题，尤其是当图的分支因子(即任意顶点的邻居数目)较大时。因此，本研究旨在减少 MOA* 的高内存消耗，同时几乎不增加运行时间。通过推广和统一几种单目标和多目标搜索算法，我们提出了 Runtime and Memory Efficient MOA* (RME-MOA*) 方法，它能够在运行时间和内存之间求得平衡。",
