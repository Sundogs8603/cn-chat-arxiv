    "abstract": "Abstractive summarization has enjoyed renewed interest in recent years, thanks to pre-trained language models and the availability of large-scale datasets. Despite promising results, current models still suffer from generating factually inconsistent summaries, reducing their utility for real-world application. Several recent efforts attempt to address this by devising models that automatically detect factual inconsistencies in machine generated summaries. However, they focus exclusively on English, a language with abundant resources. In this work, we leverage factual consistency evaluation models to improve multilingual summarization. We explore two intuitive approaches to mitigate hallucinations based on the signal provided by a multilingual NLI model, namely data filtering and controlled generation. Experimental results in the 45 languages from the XLSum dataset show gains over strong baselines in both automatic and human evaluation.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，由于预训练语言模型和大规模数据集的可用性，抽象摘要生成再次受到关注。尽管取得了有希望的结果，但当前模型仍然存在生成事实不一致的摘要的问题，降低了它们在实际应用中的效用。最近的一些努力尝试通过设计能够自动检测机器生成摘要中的事实不一致性的模型来解决这个问题。然而，他们仅专注于资源丰富的英语。在这项工作中，我们利用事实一致性评估模型来改进多语言摘要。我们探索了两种直观的方法来减少虚构信息，分别基于多语言NLI模型提供的信号，即数据过滤和控制生成。在XLSum数据集的45种语言中进行的实验结果显示，与强基线相比，在自动和人工评估中都获得了提升。",
