    "translated_abstract": "核糖核酸（RNA）的二级结构比三级结构更稳定和更易于在细胞中访问，因此对于功能预测至关重要。尽管深度学习在这个领域中显示出了很好的结果，但当前的方法存在泛化性差和复杂性高的问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种简单而有效的RNA二级结构预测方法RFold。RFold引入了一种解耦优化的过程，将传统的约束满足问题分解为逐行和逐列优化，简化了求解过程，同时保证了输出的有效性。此外，RFold采用注意力地图作为信息表示，而不是设计手工特征。广泛的实验表明，RFold具有竞争性能，并且比现有最先进的方法具有约8倍的推理效率。代码和Colab演示可在\\href{this http URL}{this http UR}上找到。",
