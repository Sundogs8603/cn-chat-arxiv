    "abstract": "The mechanism of existing style transfer algorithms is by minimizing a hybrid loss function to push the generated image toward high similarities in both content and style. However, this type of approach cannot guarantee visual fidelity, i.e., the generated artworks should be indistinguishable from real ones. In this paper, we devise a new style transfer framework called QuantArt for high visual-fidelity stylization. QuantArt pushes the latent representation of the generated artwork toward the centroids of the real artwork distribution with vector quantization. By fusing the quantized and continuous latent representations, QuantArt allows flexible control over the generated artworks in terms of content preservation, style similarity, and visual fidelity. Experiments on various style transfer settings show that our QuantArt framework achieves significantly higher visual fidelity compared with the existing style transfer methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的风格转移算法的机制是通过最小化混合损失函数来推动生成的图像朝向内容和风格的高度相似性。然而，这种方法不能保证视觉保真度，即生成的艺术作品应该与真实的艺术品难以区分。在本文中，我们设计了一个称为QuantArt的新风格转移框架，以实现高可视化保真的样式化。QuantArt通过向量量化将生成的艺术品的潜在表示推向真实艺术品分布的中心。通过融合量化和连续的潜在表示，QuantArt允许在内容保留、风格相似性和视觉保真度方面对生成的艺术品进行灵活控制。在各种风格转移设置上的实验证明，我们的QuantArt框架与现有的风格转移方法相比，可以实现显著更高的视觉保真度。",
