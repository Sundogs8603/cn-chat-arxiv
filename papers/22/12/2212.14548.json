    "translated_abstract": "立场检测是指从给定文本中提取对目标的立场（支持、反对或中立）的任务。随着社交媒体内容的大量增加，这方面的研究越来越受到关注。传统的处理立场检测的框架是将其转化为文本分类任务。深度学习模型已经取代了基于规则的模型和传统的机器学习模型来解决此类问题。目前的深度神经网络面临两个主要挑战，即标记数据和社交媒体帖子中的信息不足，以及深度学习模型的不可解释性。ChatGPT是一种新的预训练语言模型，于2022年11月30日发布。针对立场检测任务，我们的实验表明，ChatGPT可以在常用数据集（包括SemEval-2016和P-Stance）上实现SOTA或类似的性能。同时，ChatGPT可以为其自身的预测提供解释，这超出了任何现有模型的能力。",
