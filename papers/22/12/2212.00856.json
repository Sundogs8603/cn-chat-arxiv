    "translated_abstract": "不确定性在工程设计、统计学习和决策制定中普遍存在。由于固有的风险规避和对假设的模糊性，通常通过制定和解决使用风险和相关概念的保守优化模型来解决不确定性问题。我们对过去25年来风险测度的快速发展进行了调查。从它们在金融工程领域的起步，我们回顾了它们在几乎所有领域的工程和应用数学中的应用。风险测度扎根于凸分析，为处理不确定性提供了一个具有重要计算和理论优势的通用框架。我们描述了关键事实，列举了几种具体算法，并提供了大量参考文献供进一步阅读。该调查还回顾了与效用理论和分布鲁棒优化的联系，指出了新兴应用领域，如公平机器学习，并定义了相对测度。",
