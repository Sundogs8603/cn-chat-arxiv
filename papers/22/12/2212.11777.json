    "abstract": "In this article, we present a collection of radio map datasets in dense urban setting, which we generated and made publicly available. The datasets include simulated pathloss/received signal strength (RSS) and time of arrival (ToA) radio maps over a large collection of realistic dense urban setting in real city maps. The two main applications of the presented dataset are 1) learning methods that predict the pathloss from input city maps (namely, deep learning-based simulations), and, 2) wireless localization. The fact that the RSS and ToA maps are computed by the same simulations over the same city maps allows for a fair comparison of the RSS and ToA-based localization methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了在稠密城市环境中生成并公开提供的一组无线地图数据集。这些数据集包括模拟的路径损耗/接收信号强度（RSS）和到达时间（ToA）无线地图，覆盖了大量真实城市地图的稠密城市设置。该数据集的两个主要应用是1）从输入的城市地图预测路径损耗的学习方法（即基于深度学习的模拟），以及2）无线定位。RSS和ToA地图通过相同的模拟在相同的城市地图上计算得出，可以对基于RSS和ToA的定位方法进行公平比较。",
