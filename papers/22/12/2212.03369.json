    "translated_abstract": "探索不同人类活动排放情景的气候影响对于制定气候变化减缓和适应的决策至关重要。先进的地球系统模型可以提供对这些影响的详细洞见，但每个情景的计算成本很高。这种巨大的计算负担引发了对开发廉价的机器学习模型进行气候模型仿真任务的兴趣。在本文中，我们探讨了随机连接的神经网络在这一任务中的有效性。我们描述了如何构建这些网络，并将它们与传统的前馈神经网络进行比较，使用ClimateBench数据集进行评估。具体而言，我们将多层感知机、卷积神经网络和卷积长短期记忆网络中串行连接的稠密层替换为随机连接的稠密层，并评估在拥有100万和1000万参数的模型上的性能影响。我们发现，随机连接的神经网络在能耗较低的情况下可以获得与传统网络相当的模型性能。",
