This work examines market mechanisms to incentivize LER investments, while ensuring adequate market revenues for investors, guiding investors' strategic investments towards social optimum, and protecting consumers from scarcity prices. To reduce the impact of excessive scarcity prices, we present a new market mechanism, which consists of a Penalty payment for lost load, a supply Incentive, and an energy price Uplift (PIU). We establish a game-theoretical framework to analyze market equilibrium. We prove that one Nash equilibrium under the penalty payment and supply incentive can reach the social optimum given quadratic supply costs of CERs. Although the price uplift can ensure adequate revenues, the resulting system cost deviates from the social optimum while the gap decreases as more CERs retire",

    "translated_abstract": "电力市场正从传统能源资源（如化石燃料）的主导地位转向低碳能源资源（如可再生能源和储能）。本研究研究了激励低碳能源投资的市场机制，同时确保投资者获得足够的市场收入，引导投资者的战略投资达到社会最优，并保护消费者免受供应短缺造成的高价影响。为了减少供应短缺价格的影响，我们提出了一种新的市场机制，包括失掉负荷的罚款支付、供应激励和能源价格抬升（PIU）。我们建立了一个博弈论框架来分析市场均衡。我们证明，在罚款支付和供应激励的情况下，存在一个纳什均衡点可以达到社会最优，假设传统能源资源的供应成本为二次函数。虽然能源价格抬升可以确保足够的收入，但所得的系统成本偏离了社会最优，这个差距随着更多传统能源资源的退役而减少。",

Although energy price uplift ensures adequate revenues, the resulting system cost deviates from the social optimum, which decreases as more conventional energy resources retire."
