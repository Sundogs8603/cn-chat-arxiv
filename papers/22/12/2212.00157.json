The principal contracts with each agent sequentially, and seeks to maximize the worst-case discounted sum of payoffs, where the worst case is over the possible action sets. The principal observes the action chosen by the first agent, and then offers a new contract to the second agent based on this knowledge, thus having the opportunity to explore in the first period. We introduce and compare three different notions of dynamic worst-case considerations. Within each notion, we define a suitable rule of updating and characterize the principal's optimal payoff guarantee. We find that linear contracts are robustly optimal not only in static settings, but also in dynamic environments with exploration.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个两期的道德风险问题；有两个代理人，其行动集对于委托人来说是未知的。委托人依次与每个代理人签订合同，并寻求最大化最坏情况下的折现收益总和，最坏情况是在可能的行动集上进行考虑。委托人观察第一个代理人选择的行动，然后根据这个知识向第二个代理人提供一个新的合同，从而有机会在第一期进行探索。我们引入并比较了三种不同的动态最坏情况考虑方式。在每种观点中，我们定义了一种合适的更新规则，并描述了委托人的最优收益保证。我们发现线性合同不仅在静态环境下是稳健最优的，而且在具有探索的动态环境中也是稳健最优的。",
