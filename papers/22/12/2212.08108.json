    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的漏洞检测已经展示出了很好的性能，并且在一些研究中超过了静态分析工具。然而，最高性能的方法使用基于token的transformer模型，这不是捕捉漏洞检测所需的代码语义最高效的方法。传统的程序分析技术，如数据流分析，可以根据其根本原因检测出许多类型的错误。在本文中，我们提出将此类基于因果关系的漏洞检测算法与深度学习相结合，以实现更高效和有效的漏洞检测。具体而言，我们设计了DeepDFA，这是一个基于数据流分析启发的图学习框架和一种嵌入技术，可以使图学习模拟数据流计算。我们展示了DeepDFA既具有性能又具有效率。DeepDFA超过了所有非transformer基线模型。它的训练时间只需9分钟，比具有最高性能的基线模型快75倍。",
