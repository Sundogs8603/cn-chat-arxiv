    "translated_abstract": "随着越来越多的数据被收集，数据驱动建模方法近年来越来越受欢迎。虽然经典灰盒模型在物理上是可靠的，但通常很难识别和扩展，并且受其有限的表现力影响可能会影响其准确性。另一方面，常常依赖神经网络 (NNs) 的经典黑盒方法通常能够从数据中推导出统计模式，即使在扩展方面也能取得令人印象深刻的性能。然而，它们对潜在的物理定律完全无视，如果基于它们做决策用于实际物理系统，可能会导致潜在的灾难性后果。最近开发了物理一致神经网络 (PCNNs) 来解决这些问题，确保物理一致性，同时利用 NNs 实现最先进的准确性。在这项工作中，我们将 PCNN 扩展到建筑温度动态建模，并提出与经典灰盒和黑盒方法的彻底比较。特别是，我们研究多区域建筑模型，其中每个区域的热行为由能量平衡方程式统治，其参数必须通过测量数据进行识别。所得结果表明，即使涉及许多相互作用的组件构成的复杂和动态系统，PCNNs 也可以在确保物理一致性的同时实现高精度。此外，我们证明 PCNN 在经典灰盒模型上提供了可扩展性优势，在有限的可用训练数据下表现出色。",
