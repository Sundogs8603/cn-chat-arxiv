    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度强化学习在多种地形的足式 locomotion 中通过在物理模拟中训练策略并将其迁移到真实世界（即 sim-to-real 迁移）上已成为一种有吸引力的替代方法。尽管取得了相当大的进展，但传统神经网络的容量和可扩展性仍然受到限制，这可能阻碍它们在更复杂的环境中的应用。相反，Transformer 架构在广泛的大规模序列建模任务中已经展示了它的优越性，包括自然语言处理和决策问题。在本文中，我们提出了 Terrain Transformer（TERT），一种用于各种地形中四足运动控制的高容量 Transformer 模型。此外，为了更好地利用 Transformer 在 sim-to-real 场景中，我们提出了一种新的两阶段训练框架，包括离线预训练阶段和在线校正阶段，可以自然地将 Transformer 与 privilege",
