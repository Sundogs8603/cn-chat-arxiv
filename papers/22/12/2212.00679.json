    "translated_abstract": "在安全关键场景中，对于控制器的自动化合成可以确保系统的正确性至关重要。然而，混合特性和随机或未知的行为使得合成控制器的问题变得具有挑战性。本论文提出了一种方法，用于合成马尔可夫跳变线性系统（MJLS）的控制器，这是一类离散时钟模型的控制器，用于解决这些系统的安全问题，以确保满足概率计算树逻辑（PCTL）公式。一个MJLS由一组有限的随机线性动态和这些动态之间的离散跳变组成，这些跳变由一个马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）来管理。我们考虑了这个MDP的转移概率未知或已知但存在一定的区间。我们的方法基于一个有限状态抽象，捕捉了MJLS的离散（模式跳跃）和连续（随机线性）行为。我们将这个抽象形式化为一个区间MDP（iMDP），然后计算了状态转移区间。",
