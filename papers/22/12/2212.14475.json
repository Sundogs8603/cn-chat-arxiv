    "abstract": "This paper analyses a two-region model with vertical innovations that enhance the quality of varieties of the horizontally differentiated manufactures produced in each of the two regions. We look at how the creation and diffusion of knowledge and increasing returns in manufacturing interact to shape the spatial economy. Innovations occur with a probability that depends on the inter-regional interaction between researchers (mobile workers). We find that, if the weight of interaction with foreign scientists is relatively more important for the success of innovation, the model accounts for re-dispersion of economic activities after an initial stage of progressive agglomeration as transport costs decrease from a high level.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了一个具有垂直创新的两地区模型，该模型提高了每个地区生产的水平差异制造品种的质量。我们研究知识的创造和传播以及制造业的不断增长如何相互作用来塑造空间经济。创新发生的概率取决于研究人员（流动工人）之间的跨区域互动。我们发现，如果和外国科学家的互动关系对于创新的成功比较重要，随着运输成本从高水平降低，该模型可以解释经济活动在初期的渐进性聚集之后重新分散。",
