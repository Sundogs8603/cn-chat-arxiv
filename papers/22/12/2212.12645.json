    "translated_abstract": "最近的一些工作利用生成对抗网络(GAN)的表现力生成带标签的合成数据集。这些数据集生成方法通常需要新的合成图像的注释，这迫使从业者寻找注释者，策划一组合成图像，并确保生成的标签的质量。我们引入了HandsOff框架，这是一种在少于50个现有标记图像上训练后能够产生无限数量的合成图像和相应标签的技术。我们的框架通过将GAN反演领域与数据集生成相结合避免了以前工作的实际缺点。我们在多个具有挑战性的领域生成具有丰富像素级标签的数据集，如人脸、汽车、全身姿势和城市驾驶场景。与先前的数据集生成方法和迁移学习相比，我们的方法在语义分割、关键点检测和深度估计方面取得了最先进的性能。",
