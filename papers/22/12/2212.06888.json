    "abstract": "Perpetual futures -- swap contracts that never expire -- are the most popular derivative traded in cryptocurrency markets, with more than \\$100 billion traded daily. Perpetuals provide investors with leveraged exposure to cryptocurrencies, which does not require rollover or direct cryptocurrency holding. To keep the gap between perpetual futures and spot prices small, long position holders periodically pay short position holders a funding rate proportional to this gap. The funding rate incentivizes trades that tend to narrow the futures-spot gap. But unlike fixed-maturity futures, perpetuals are not guaranteed to converge to the spot price of their underlying asset at any time, and familiar no-arbitrage prices for perpetuals are not available, as the contracts have no expiry date to enforce arbitrage. Here, using a weaker notion of random-maturity arbitrage, we derive no-arbitrage prices for perpetual futures in frictionless markets and no-arbitrage bounds for markets with trading cost",

    "translated_abstract": "永续期货是从未到期的交换合同，是加密货币市场上最受欢迎的衍生品，每天交易量超过1000亿美元。永续期货为投资者提供杠杆加密货币投资方式，无需卷续或直接持有加密货币。为了保持永续期货价格与现货价格之间的差距小，多头持仓人周期性地向空头持仓人支付与差距成比例的融资费率。融资费率鼓励交易，倾向于缩小期货与现货价差。但是，与固定到期的期货不同，永续期货没有任何到期日来执行套利，因此无法获得熟悉的无套利价格。在这里，我们使用较弱的随机到期套利概念，推导了无摩擦市场中永续期货的无套利价格，以及在存在交易成本市场中的无套利价格范围。",
