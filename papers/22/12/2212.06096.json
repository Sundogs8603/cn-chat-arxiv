    "translated_abstract": "可定向卷积神经网络提供了构建与平移和其他变换等同变换的神经网络的通用框架，这些变换属于基于原点保持的群G，例如反射和旋转。它们依赖于通过在核空间上强加特定于群G的等变性约束来解析求解得到的G-定向卷积核的标准卷积。由于解决方案对特定的群G定制，核基础的实现不能推广到其他对称变换，这导致了通用群等变模型的开发复杂化。我们提出使用通过多层感知器(MLPs)参数化G-定向卷积核的隐式神经表示。所得到的框架提供了一种简单灵活的实现可定向卷积神经网络的方法，并且对于任何可以构建G-等变MLP的群G都可以推广。我们在多个任务上证明了我们的方法的有效性，包括N体模拟。",
