    "abstract": "Many efforts have been made to construct dialog systems for different types of conversations, such as task-oriented dialog (TOD) and open-domain dialog (ODD). To better mimic human-level conversations that usually fuse various dialog modes, it is essential to build a system that can effectively handle both TOD and ODD and access different knowledge sources. To address the lack of available data for the fused task, we propose a framework for automatically generating dialogues that combine knowledge-grounded ODDs and TODs in various settings. Additionally, we introduce a unified model PivotBot that is capable of appropriately adopting TOD and ODD modes and accessing different knowledge sources in order to effectively tackle the fused task. Evaluation results demonstrate the superior ability of the proposed model to switch seamlessly between TOD and ODD tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "已经进行了许多努力来构建适用于不同类型对话的对话系统，如任务导向对话（TOD）和开放领域对话（ODD）。为了更好地模仿人类级别的对话，通常需要融合各种对话模式，并建立一个可以有效处理TOD和ODD，并访问不同知识源的系统。为了解决融合任务缺乏可用数据的问题，我们提出了一个框架，用于自动生成在不同环境中结合了知识为基础的ODD和TOD的对话。此外，我们介绍了一个统一模型PivotBot，能够适当地采用TOD和ODD模式，并访问不同的知识源，以便有效地处理融合任务。评估结果表明，所提出的模型在TOD和ODD任务之间无缝切换的能力优于其他模型。",
