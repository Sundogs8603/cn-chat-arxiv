    "translated_abstract": "最优传输（OT）已经在机器学习、数据科学和计算机视觉中变得极其流行。OT问题的核心假设是源和目标测度的总质量相等，这限制了它的应用。最优偏转运输（OPT）是最近提出的解决这个限制的方法。与OT问题类似，OPT的计算依赖于解决线性规划问题（通常在高维度中），这可能会变得计算上困难。在本文中，我们提出了一种计算一维非负测度之间OPT问题的有效算法。接下来，遵循切片OT距离的思想，我们利用切片定义了切片OPT距离。最后，我们展示了切片OPT-based方法在各种数值实验中的计算和精度优势。特别是，我们展示了我们提出的Sliced-OPT在噪声点云配准中的应用。",
