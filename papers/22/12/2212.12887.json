    "translated_abstract": "使用脉冲神经网络(SNNs)进行高效和鲁棒的控制仍然是一个待解决的问题。虽然生物系统的行为是通过稀疏和不规则的脉冲模式产生的，这提供了鲁棒和高效的控制，但用于控制的大部分人工脉冲神经网络的活动模式是密集和规则的，可能导致代码效率较低。此外，对于大多数现有的控制解决方案，即使对于完全识别的系统，也需要网络训练或优化，使得它们在芯片低功耗解决方案中的实施变得复杂。脉冲编码网络(SCNs)的神经科学理论提供了在循环脉冲神经网络中实现动态系统的完全分析解决方案，同时保持不规则、稀疏和鲁棒的脉冲活动，但如何直接应用于控制问题还不清楚。在这里，我们通过引入闭式最优估计和控制来扩展SCN理论。",
