    "translated_abstract": "在数据流上的机器学习文献非常广泛且不断增长。然而，关于数据流学习任务的定义假设通常太强，在实践中难以满足或者甚至相互矛盾，尤其在监督学习的背景下。算法的选择和设计基于通常不明确说明的标准，针对不明确定义的问题设置，在不现实的环境中进行测试，并且与更广泛的文献中的相关方法孤立地进行。这对于在这种背景下构思的许多方法产生了真实世界影响的可能性提出了质疑，并且存在传播误导性研究焦点的风险。我们提议通过重新构思监督数据流学习的基本定义和设置，以考虑相关概念漂移和时间依赖的现代思考方式来解决这些问题；同时，我们重新审视了什么构成了监督数据流学习任务，以及重新考虑一些关于数据流学习的基本假设。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper examines the issues with the definitions and settings of machine learning tasks on data streams, and proposes a rethinking of the fundamental definitions and settings of supervised data-stream learning. It also reconsiders some of the basic assumptions about data stream learning."
