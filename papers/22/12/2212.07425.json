    "translated_abstract": "在互联网时代，虚假信息、宣传和错误论证的传播现象得到了放大。给定数据量的庞大和识别论证规范违规的微妙性，使用可靠的方法来识别逻辑谬误来支持信息分析任务（如内容审核）是至关重要的。本文将以前关于逻辑谬误的理论工作制定为检测、粗粒度和细粒度分类的综合三阶段评估框架。我们针对评估的每个阶段对现有的评估数据集进行了适应。我们采用了基于原型推理、基于实例推理和知识注入的三个鲁棒且可解释的方法族。这些方法结合了语言模型、背景知识和可解释的机制。此外，我们通过数据增强和课程学习的策略解决了数据稀疏性的问题。我们的三阶段框架自然地巩固了以前的数据集和方法。",
