    "translated_abstract": "多样化返回结果对于满足客户的各种兴趣和提供者的市场曝光是重要的研究课题。近年来，对多样化研究的关注不断增加，伴随着对在搜索和推荐中促进多样性的方法的文献大量涌现。然而，检索系统中的多样化研究缺乏系统组织，存在片段化的问题。在这项调研中，我们首次提出了一个统一的分类体系，用于将搜索和推荐中的多样化指标和方法进行分类，这两个领域是检索系统中研究最广泛的领域之一。我们从简要讨论为何多样性在检索系统中重要开始调研，然后总结了搜索和推荐中的各种多样性问题，突出了它们之间的关系和差异。调研的主体部分，我们提供了一个统一的框架，包括描述现有多样化指标和方法的详细内容，展示了各种应用在搜索和推荐中的调研成果。最后，我们对当前的研究趋势进行了讨论，并指出了未来的研究方向和挑战。",
