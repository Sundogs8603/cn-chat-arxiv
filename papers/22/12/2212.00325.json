    "translated_abstract": "垂直联合学习（VFL）是一种流行的协作机器学习模型训练方案。现有的工业框架使用同态加密等安全多方计算技术来确保数据的安全性和隐私性。尽管有这些努力，研究发现由于中间表示与原始数据之间的相关性，数据泄露仍然是VFL中的风险。神经网络能够准确捕捉这些相关性，使得对手可以重构数据。这强调了对于保护VFL系统的持续研究的需要。我们的工作表明，哈希算法是对抗数据重构攻击的一种有希望的解决方案。哈希的单向性使得对手难以从哈希码中恢复数据。然而，在VFL中实施哈希算法也带来了新的挑战，包括梯度消失和信息丢失。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了HashVFL，它将哈希算法与垂直联合学习相结合，同时实现了最佳的结果。",
