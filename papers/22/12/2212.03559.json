    "translated_abstract": "对比深度图聚类（CDGC）利用对比学习将节点分组到不同的簇中。更好的增强技术有助于提高对比样本的质量，因此成为改善性能的关键因素之一。然而，现有方法中的增强样本始终由人类经验预定义，并且与下游任务聚类无关，从而导致人力资源成本高和性能差。为此，我们提出了一种通过可学习增强技术进行属性图聚类的方法（AGCLA），为CDGC引入可学习的增强器，以获得高质量且适合的增强样本。具体而言，我们设计了两种可学习的增强器分别用于属性和结构信息。此外，生成了两个改进矩阵，包括高置信度伪标签矩阵和跨视图样本相似度矩阵，以提高学习的亲和矩阵的可靠性。在训练过程中，我们不断调整这些增强器和改进矩阵，以最大程度地提高聚类性能。",
