    "abstract": "Image captioning is one of the straightforward tasks that can take advantage of large-scale web-crawled data which provides rich knowledge about the visual world for a captioning model. However, since web-crawled data contains image-text pairs that are aligned at different levels, the inherent noises (e.g., misaligned pairs) make it difficult to learn a precise captioning model. While the filtering strategy can effectively remove noisy data, it leads to a decrease in learnable knowledge and sometimes brings about a new problem of data deficiency. To take the best of both worlds, we propose a Noise-aware Captioning (NoC) framework, which learns rich knowledge from the whole web-crawled data while being less affected by the noises. This is achieved by the proposed alignment-level-controllable captioner, which is learned using alignment levels of the image-text pairs as a control signal during training. The alignment-level-conditioned training allows the model to generate high-quality cap",

    "translated_abstract": "图像字幕生成是一项直观的任务，可以利用大规模网络爬取数据，为生成模型提供丰富的关于视觉世界的知识。然而，由于网络爬取数据包含不同级别对齐的图像-文本对，固有的噪声（例如不对齐的对）使得学习一个精确的字幕生成模型变得困难。虽然过滤策略可以有效去除噪声数据，但它会导致可学习知识的减少，并有时带来数据不足的新问题。为了兼顾两者的优势，我们提出了一种噪声感知字幕生成（NoC）框架，它能够从整个网络爬取的数据中学习丰富的知识，同时较少受到噪声的影响。这是通过所提出的对齐级别可控的字幕生成器实现的，该生成器在训练过程中使用图像-文本对的对齐级别作为控制信号进行学习。对齐级别条件的训练使得模型能够产生高质量的字幕。",
