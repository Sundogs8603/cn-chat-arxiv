    "translated_abstract": "概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)是可解释的神经网络，首先针对与预测任务相关的人可解释的概念预测标签，然后基于这些预测结果预测最终的标签。我们将CBMs扩展到交互式预测设置中，使得模型可以向人类协作者查询某些概念的标签。我们开发了一种交互策略，在预测时选择要请求标签的概念，以最大限度地提高最终预测的准确性。我们展示了一个简单的策略，结合了概念预测的不确定性和概念对最终预测结果的影响，在Caltech-UCSD Birds、CheXpert和OAI数据集上实现了强大的性能，并且优于文献中提出的静态方法和主动特征采集方法。我们展示了交互式CBM只需进行5次交互，就能在竞争基准上实现5-10%的准确率提高。",
