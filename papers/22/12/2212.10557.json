This unpredictability diminishes user trust and can hinder the use of the models in the real world. To address this, we introduce DialGuide, a novel framework for controlling dialogue model behavior using natural language rules, or guidelines. These guidelines provide information about the context they are applicable to and what should be included in the response, allowing the models to generate responses that are more closely aligned with the developer's expectations and intent. We evaluate DialGuide on three tasks in open-domain dialogue response generation: guideline selection, response generation, and response entailment verification.

    "translated_abstract": "对话模型能够生成连贯流畅的回复，但是仍然具有挑战性，可能会产生不吸引人、不安全的结果，这种不可预测性会影响用户信任并限制模型在实际环境中的应用。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了DialGuide，这是一个使用自然语言规则或指南控制对话模型行为的新框架。这些指南提供了关于它们适用的上下文和响应内容的信息，使得模型能够生成与开发者期望和意图更加一致的响应。我们在开放域对话回复生成的三个任务上评估了DialGuide：指南选择，响应生成和响应包含验证。我们的数据集包含两个领域（闲聊和安全）的10,737个正向和15,467个负向对话上下文-响应-指南三元组，为这些任务提供了基准模型。",
