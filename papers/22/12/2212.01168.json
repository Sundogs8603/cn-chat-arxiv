    "translated_abstract": "最近物理学中深度学习的进展集中在通过将物理先验或归纳偏见引入神经网络来发现目标系统的共享表示。然而，这些方法特定于系统，不允许轻松适应由不同物理法则驱动的新物理系统。例如，训练于质点弹簧系统的神经网络无法准确预测双体系统或任何具有不同物理法则的系统的行为。在本研究中，我们使用图神经网络模拟我们的系统，并采用元学习算法使模型在一系列任务中积累经验，并使其适应新的物理系统。我们的方法旨在学习跨各种哈密顿流形的通用表示，这是哈密顿系统数据分布的共同特征。我们使用由不同系统组成的数据集训练模型，每个系统都有其自身固有的动力学，并评估其性能。",
