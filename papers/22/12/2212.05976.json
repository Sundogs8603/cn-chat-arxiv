    "translated_abstract": "由于机器学习的进展，大量软件工程任务的自动化成为可能。在将机器学习应用于软件工件（如源代码或可执行代码）时，关键是将它们转化为适合学习的形式。传统上，研究人员依赖于基于专家知识的手动选择特征，但有时这种方法可能不准确或不完全。表示学习使得机器学习能自动选择合适的表示和相关特征。然而，对于与Android相关的任务，现有模型如apk2vec聚焦于整个应用程序级别，或者专注于特定任务如smali2vec，这限制了它们的适用性。我们的研究是一项新的研究方向，旨在调查Android字节码的有效、任务无关和精细化的通用表示，以减轻这两个限制。这些表示旨在捕捉与各种低级下游任务（例如类级别）相关的信息。",
