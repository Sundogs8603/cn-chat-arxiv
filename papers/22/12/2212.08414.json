    "translated_abstract": "光度立体是从多个具有不同阴影线索的图像中恢复物体的表面法线，即建立每个像素点的表面方向和亮度之间的关系模型。光度立体在每个像素点的分辨率和细节重建方面具有优势。然而，由于非兰伯特表面反射引起的非线性关系，光度立体是一个复杂的问题。最近，各种深度学习方法在非兰伯特表面的光度立体环境中展现了强大的能力。本文综述了现有的基于深度学习的校准光度立体方法。首先，我们从不同的角度对这些方法进行了分析，包括输入处理、监督和网络架构。然后，我们总结了深度学习光度立体模型在最广泛使用的基准数据集上的性能。这证明了基于深度学习的光度立体方法的先进性能。",
