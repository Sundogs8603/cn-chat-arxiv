    "abstract": "Evaluating automatically-generated text summaries is a challenging task. While there have been many interesting approaches, they still fall short of human evaluations. We present RISE, a new approach for evaluating summaries by leveraging techniques from information retrieval. RISE is first trained as a retrieval task using a dual-encoder retrieval setup, and can then be subsequently utilized for evaluating a generated summary given an input document, without gold reference summaries. RISE is especially well suited when working on new datasets where one may not have reference summaries available for evaluation. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the SummEval benchmark (Fabbri et al., 2021) and the results show that RISE has higher correlation with human evaluations compared to many past approaches to summarization evaluation. Furthermore, RISE also demonstrates data-efficiency and generalizability across languages.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于自动生成的文本摘要进行评估是一项具有挑战性的任务。尽管出现了许多有趣的方法，但仍然无法达到人类评估的水平。本文提出了RISE，一种利用信息检索技术进行摘要评估的新方法。RISE首先作为一个检索任务进行训练，使用双编码器检索设置，并且可以在没有参考摘要的情况下评估给定输入文档的生成摘要。当评估新数据集时，RISE特别适用，因为可能没有参考摘要可用于评估。我们在SummEval基准测试（Fabbri et al.，2021）上进行了全面实验，结果表明RISE与许多过去的摘要评估方法相比，与人类评估具有更高的相关性。此外，RISE还展示了跨语言的数据效率和泛化能力。",
