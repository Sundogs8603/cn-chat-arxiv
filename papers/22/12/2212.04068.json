    "abstract": "While pre-trained Chinese language models have demonstrated impressive performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, the Chinese Spell Checking (CSC) task remains a challenge. Previous research has explored using information such as glyphs and phonetics to improve the ability to distinguish misspelled characters, with good results. However, the generalization ability of these models is not well understood: it is unclear whether they incorporate glyph-phonetic information and, if so, whether this information is fully utilized. In this paper, we aim to better understand the role of glyph-phonetic information in the CSC task and suggest directions for improvement. Additionally, we propose a new, more challenging, and practical setting for testing the generalizability of CSC models. All code is made publicly available.",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然预训练的中文语言模型在各种自然语言处理任务中表现出色，但汉语漏字检查（CSC）仍然是一个挑战。先前的研究探讨了使用字形和音标等信息来改善区分错拼字符的能力，取得了良好的结果。然而，这些模型的泛化能力并不好理解：不清楚它们是否包含字形音标信息，以及如果包含这些信息，是否充分利用了。在本文中，我们旨在更好地了解字形音标信息在 CSC 任务中的作用，并提出改进的方向。此外，我们提出了一个新的、更具挑战性和实用的 CSC 模型泛化性测试设置。所有代码都已公开发布。",
