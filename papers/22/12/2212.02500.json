    "translated_abstract": "降噪扩散模型为生成多样而逼真的人体动作提供了巨大的潜力。然而，现有的运动扩散模型在扩散过程中往往忽视了物理定律，并且经常生成出具有明显缺陷的不符合物理规律的动作，如浮空、滑脚和透地。这严重影响了生成动作的质量并限制了它们在现实世界中的应用。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的物理引导的运动扩散模型（PhysDiff），它将物理约束融入到扩散过程中。具体地，我们提出了一个基于物理模拟器中运动模仿的物理运动投影模块，用于将扩散步骤的去噪动作投影为符合物理规律的动作。投影后的动作进一步用于下一个扩散步骤，以引导去噪扩散过程。直观地说，我们模型中使用物理定律使得动作逐步趋向于符合物理规律。",
