    "translated_abstract": "分散化金融（DeFi）以其独特的机制设计而闻名，其应用智能合约以促进点对点交易。分散化银行是一种典型的DeFi应用。理想情况下，分散化银行应该在交易方面也分散化。然而，许多最近的研究发现，分散化银行并没有实现显著的分散化程度。本研究对主流分散化银行进行了比较研究。我们使用四家分散化银行（Liquity、Aave、MakerDao和Compound）的交易数据应用核心-外围网络特征分析。我们提取了六个特征并在横截面上比较了银行的分散化水平。根据分析结果，我们发现：1）MakerDao和Compound在交易中比Aave和Liquity更为分散化。2）尽管分散化银行交易应该是分散化的，但数据显示四家银行存在主要的外部交易。",
