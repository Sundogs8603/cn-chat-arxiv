    "translated_abstract": "我们将分层自回归神经（HAN）网络采样算法应用于二维 $Q$ 状态 Potts 模型，并在 $Q=12$ 时绕过相变进行模拟。我们量化了该方法在一级相变的附近表现，并将其与 Wolff 簇算法进行了比较。我们发现在相似的数值带中，该方法在统计不确定性方面有显着改进。为了有效地训练大型神经网络，我们引入了预训练技术。它使得可以使用较小的系统大小训练某些神经网络，然后将它们用作更大系统大小的起始配置。这是由于我们的分层方法的递归构造而实现的。我们的结果证明了分层方法在具有双峰分布的系统上的性能。此外，我们还提供了在相变附近的自由能和熵的估计。",
