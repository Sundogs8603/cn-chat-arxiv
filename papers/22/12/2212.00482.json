    "translated_abstract": "在多轮对话中，响应选择的任务是从所有候选项中找到最佳选项。为了提高模型的推理能力，先前的研究更关注使用明确的算法来建模话语之间的依赖关系，这些关系是确定性的、有限的和不灵活的。此外，很少有研究考虑到推理之前和之后选项之间的差异。在本文中，我们提出了一种隐式关系推理图网络来解决这些问题，它由话语关系推理器（URR）和选项双重比较器（ODC）组成。URR的目标是隐式提取话语之间以及话语和选项之间的依赖关系，并使用关系图卷积网络进行推理。ODC专注于通过双重比较感知选项之间的差异，从而排除噪声选项的干扰。在两个多轮对话推理基准数据集MuTual上进行的实验结果表明，提出的方法在响应选择任务上取得了显著的性能提升。",
