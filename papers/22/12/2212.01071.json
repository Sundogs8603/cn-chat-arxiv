The graph nature of data with the large number of nodes caused different obstacles including a considerable amount of unrelated features in matrices as high dispersion and imbalance classes in the dataset. To deal with these issues Auto-encoders and a combination of semi-supervised learning and the GAN algorithm which is called SGAN were used. This paper is deploying a smaller number of labels and applying SGAN as a classifier. The result of this test showed that the accuracy had reached 91\\% in detecting fake accounts using only 100 labeled samples.",
