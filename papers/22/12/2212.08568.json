    "translated_abstract": "在各个机器学习（ML）研究和实践领域，国际基准竞赛的数量在稳步增加。然而，迄今为止，对于社区在应对提出的研究问题时的常见实践和遇到的瓶颈了解甚少。为了揭示生物医学图像分析领域算法开发的现状，我们设计了一项国际调查，该调查针对与IEEE ISBI 2021和MICCAI 2021会议（总共80个竞赛）相关的挑战的所有参与者进行。调查涵盖了参与者的专业知识和工作环境、他们选择的策略以及算法特性。其中有中位数为72%的竞赛参与者参与了这项调查。根据我们的结果，知识交流是参与的主要动机（70%），而奖金的获得只起到次要作用（16%）。参与者平均花费80个工作小时进行算法开发。",
