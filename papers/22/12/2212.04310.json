    "abstract": "In recent years, distributional language representation models have demonstrated great practical success. At the same time, the need for interpretability has elicited questions on their intrinsic properties and capabilities. Crucially, distributional models are often inconsistent when dealing with compositional phenomena in natural language, which has significant implications for their safety and fairness. Despite this, most current research on compositionality is directed towards improving their performance on similarity tasks only. This work takes a different approach, and proposes a methodology for measuring compositional behavior in contemporary language models. Specifically, we focus on adjectival modifier phenomena in adjective-noun phrases. We introduce three novel tests of compositional behavior inspired by Montague semantics. Our experimental results indicate that current neural language models behave according to the expected linguistic theories to a limited extent only. This",

    "translated_abstract": "在最近几年中，分布式语言表示模型已经取得了巨大的成功。同时，可解释性的需求引发了人们对它们的本质属性和能力的质疑。尤其是，分布式模型在处理自然语言的组合现象时往往不一致，这对它们的安全性和公平性具有重要的影响。尽管如此，目前大多数有关合成性的研究只是针对改善它们在相似性任务上的表现。本研究采取了不同的方法，提出了一种用于测量当代语言模型组成性行为的方法。具体而言，我们关注形容词修饰名词短语中的形容词修饰现象。我们引入了三个灵感来自蒙塔古语意的合成行为测试。我们的实验结果表明，当前的神经语言模型只在某种程度上符合预期的语言理论。",
