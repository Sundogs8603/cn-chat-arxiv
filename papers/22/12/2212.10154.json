    "translated_abstract": "文本分类器在简历筛选和内容审核等高风险任务中具有广泛的应用。这些分类器必须是公平的，并通过对敏感属性（如性别或种族）的扰动不变来避免歧视性决策。然而，人类对这些扰动的直觉与捕捉它们的形式相似度规范之间存在差距。尽管现有研究已经开始解决这个问题，但当前的方法基于硬编码单词替换，导致规范的表达能力有限或者无法充分地与人类直觉相一致（例如，在不对称的反事实情况下）。本研究提出了新方法来弥合这一差距，发现具有表现力和直觉公平规范。我们展示了如何利用无监督式转换和GPT-3的零-shot能力自动生成语义上类似但在敏感属性上有所不同的表达丰富的候选句子对。然后，我们采用群众外包获得这些候选人的成对人类判断，并使用它们来训练模型，将语义相似性映射到统计代理的个体公平性。我们的实验表明，我们的方法在表现能力、与人类直觉的一致性和两个基准数据集的分类准确性方面优于先前的方法。",
