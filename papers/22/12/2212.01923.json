    "translated_abstract": "在过去的几年中，大型知识库已经被构建来存储大量的知识。然而，这些知识库高度不完整，例如Freebase中有70%的人没有出生地点。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个使用结构化和非结构化信息的多模态融合的、基于查询驱动的知识库补全系统。为了有效地融合来自Web的非结构化信息和知识库中的结构化信息以实现良好的性能，我们的系统基于问答和规则推理构建了多模态知识图。我们提出了一个多模态路径融合算法，在多模态知识图中基于不同的路径对候选答案进行排名，取得了比问答、规则推理和基线融合算法更好的性能。为了提高系统效率，我们使用了基于查询的技术来减少系统的运行时间，为用户查询提供快速响应。",
