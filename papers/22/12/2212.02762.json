    "abstract": "Objective: Evictions are important social and behavioral determinants of health. Evictions are associated with a cascade of negative events that can lead to unemployment, housing insecurity/homelessness, long-term poverty, and mental health problems. In this study, we developed a natural language processing system to automatically detect eviction status from electronic health record (EHR) notes.  Materials and Methods: We first defined eviction status (eviction presence and eviction period) and then annotated eviction status in 5000 EHR notes from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). We developed a novel model, KIRESH, that has shown to substantially outperform other state-of-the-art models such as fine-tuning pre-trained language models like BioBERT and BioClinicalBERT. Moreover, we designed a novel prompt to further improve the model performance by using the intrinsic connection between the two sub-tasks of eviction presence and period prediction. Finally, we used the Temperatur",
