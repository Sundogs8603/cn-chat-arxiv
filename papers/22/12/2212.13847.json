    "translated_abstract": "异构图对比学习近年来受到广泛关注。一些现有方法使用元路径构建对比视图。然而，大部分方法忽略了描述元路径连接对象的丰富元路径上下文。此外，他们未能区分负样本，这可能会对模型性能产生不利影响。为解决这些问题，我们提出了MEOW，它考虑了元路径上下文和加权负样本。具体而言，MEOW为对比构造了一个粗略视图和一个细粒度视图。前者反映哪些对象通过元路径相互连接，而后者使用元路径上下文并描述对象是如何连接的。然后，我们在理论上分析了InfoNCE损失并认识到它计算负样本梯度的局限性。为了更好地区分负样本，我们学习加权负样本表示，并将其用于对比学习中。",
