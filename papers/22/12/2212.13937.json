    "abstract": "Unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) studies the problem of mitigating various biases from implicit user feedback data such as clicks, and has been receiving considerable attention recently. A popular ULTR approach for real-world applications uses a two-tower architecture, where click modeling is factorized into a relevance tower with regular input features, and a bias tower with bias-relevant inputs such as the position of a document. A successful factorization will allow the relevance tower to be exempt from biases. In this work, we identify a critical issue that existing ULTR methods ignored - the bias tower can be confounded with the relevance tower via the underlying true relevance. In particular, the positions were determined by the logging policy, i.e., the previous production model, which would possess relevance information. We give both theoretical analysis and empirical results to show the negative effects on relevance tower due to such a correlation. We then propose three method",

    "translated_abstract": "无偏学习排序(ULTR)研究的问题在于从隐含的用户反馈数据（如点击）中减轻各种偏差性的影响，并且最近受到了相当大的关注。一种用于实际应用的流行ULTR方法是使用双塔结构，其中将点击建模分解为一个具有常规输入特征的关联塔和一个具有偏差相关输入（如文件位置）的偏差塔。成功的分解将允许关联塔免受偏差的影响。在这项工作中，我们发现了现有ULTR方法忽略的一个关键问题——通过底层真实关联性，偏差塔可能会与关联塔混淆。特别是，位置是由记录策略（即以前的生产模型）确定的，它将具有关联信息。我们给出了理论分析和实证结果，以展示由于这种相关性对于关联塔的负面影响。然后，我们提出了三种方法来解决这个问题。",
