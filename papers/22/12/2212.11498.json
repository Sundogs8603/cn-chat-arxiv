    "translated_abstract": "我们设想一个仓库里有数十个移动机器人和人类分拣员一起工作，收集和交付仓库内的物品。我们要解决的基本问题是称为拣货问题，即这些工作代理人如何在仓库中协调他们的移动和行为以最大化性能（例如订单吞吐量）。传统的行业方法使用启发式方法需要大量的工程努力来为固有可变的仓库配置进行优化。相比之下，多智能体强化学习（MARL）可以灵活地应用于不同的仓库配置（例如大小，布局，工人数量/类型，物品补充频率），因为代理人通过经验学习如何最优地相互合作。我们开发了分层MARL算法，其中一个管理者为工人代理分配目标，并且管理者和工人的策略被共同训练以最大化全局目标（例如拣货速率）。",
