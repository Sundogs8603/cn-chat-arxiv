    "translated_abstract": "光深度学习分类器的基准性能并不可靠来预测部署模型的性能。特别是，如果图像分类器在训练数据中捕捉到了伪特征，其预测结果可能会以意想不到的方式失败。本文提出了一个框架，可以系统地识别像ImageNet这样的大规模数据集中的伪特征。它基于我们的神经PCA组件及其可视化。之前对伪特征的相关工作通常在玩具场景中进行，或者需要昂贵的像素级注释。相比之下，我们使用ImageNet进行研究，并通过展示某个类别中存在有害伪特征就足以触发该类别的预测来验证我们的结果。我们引入了一个新的数据集\"Spurious ImageNet\"，可以衡量任何ImageNet分类器对有害伪特征的依赖性。此外，我们还引入了一种名为SpuFix的简单缓解方法来减少任何ImageNet分类器对有害伪特征的依赖性。",
