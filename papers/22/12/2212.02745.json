    "abstract": "Training dialogue systems often entails dealing with noisy training examples and unexpected user inputs. Despite their prevalence, there currently lacks an accurate survey of dialogue noise, nor is there a clear sense of the impact of each noise type on task performance. This paper addresses this gap by first constructing a taxonomy of noise encountered by dialogue systems. In addition, we run a series of experiments to show how different models behave when subjected to varying levels of noise and types of noise. Our results reveal that models are quite robust to label errors commonly tackled by existing denoising algorithms, but that performance suffers from dialogue-specific noise. Driven by these observations, we design a data cleaning algorithm specialized for conversational settings and apply it as a proof-of-concept for targeted dialogue denoising.",

    "translated_abstract": "训练对话系统常常需要处理噪音干扰和意外用户输入。尽管这些问题很普遍，但目前缺乏对对话噪音的准确调查，也没有对每种噪音类型对任务性能的影响有清晰的认识。本文首先构建了对话系统遇到的噪音分类体系。此外，我们进行了一系列实验，展示了不同模型在不同程度和类型的噪音下的行为。我们的结果显示，模型对常见标签错误非常鲁棒，但在对话特定噪音下性能下降。基于这些观察，我们设计了一种专门用于会话环境的数据清洗算法，并将其作为有针对性的对话去噪概念验证。",

The results show that models are robust to label errors but perform poorly with dialogue-specific noise. Based on this, a specialized data cleaning algorithm for conversational settings is designed and conceptually validated for targeted dialogue denoising."
