    "translated_abstract": "在设计大型项目的新API时，开发人员需要做出明智的设计选择，以确保代码库能够可持续增长。为了确保新的API组件设计良好，开发人员可以借鉴现有的API组件。然而，由于缺乏标准化的API设计比较方法，这个学习过程变得耗时且困难。为了填补这一空白，我们开发了API-Miner，根据我们的了解，这是首个API到API规范推荐引擎之一。API-Miner检索与OpenAPI（一种广泛采用的用于描述Web API的语言）编写的相关规范组件。API-Miner提出了几个重要的贡献，包括：（1）从OpenAPI规范中处理和提取关键信息的新方法，（2）为高度技术的API规范领域优化的创新特征提取技术，以及（3）一种结合多种信号以检索相关内容的新型对数线性概率模型。",
