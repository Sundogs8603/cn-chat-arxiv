    "abstract": "The cooperation of a human pilot with an autonomous agent during flight control realizes parallel autonomy. We propose an air-guardian system that facilitates cooperation between a pilot with eye tracking and a parallel end-to-end neural control system. Our vision-based air-guardian system combines a causal continuous-depth neural network model with a cooperation layer to enable parallel autonomy between a pilot and a control system based on perceived differences in their attention profiles. The attention profiles for neural networks are obtained by computing the networks' saliency maps (feature importance) through the VisualBackProp algorithm, while the attention profiles for humans are either obtained by eye tracking of human pilots or saliency maps of networks trained to imitate human pilots. When the attention profile of the pilot and guardian agents align, the pilot makes control decisions. Otherwise, the air-guardian makes interventions and takes over the control of the aircraft.",

    "translated_abstract": "在飞行控制中，人类飞行员与自动驾驶系统的协同合作实现了并行自主。我们提出了一种空中守护系统，通过眼球追踪技术实现了飞行员与并行端到端神经控制系统之间的合作。我们的基于视觉的空中守护系统将因果连续深度神经网络模型与协作层相结合，通过感知其注意力特征差异实现了飞行员与控制系统之间的并行自主。神经网络的注意力特征通过VisualBackProp算法计算得到，而人类的注意力特征则通过飞行员的眼球追踪或模仿人类飞行员训练得到的网络的显著性图进行获取。当飞行员和空中守护系统的注意力特征一致时，飞行员进行控制决策；否则，空中守护系统进行干预并接管飞行器的控制。",
