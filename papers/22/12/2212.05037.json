    "translated_abstract": "大脑的空间定位系统使用不同的神经元集合来辅助基于环境的导航。大脑通过头方向细胞和网格细胞两种方式编码空间信息。头方向细胞用于确定方向，而网格细胞由叠加的神经元层组成，提供基于环境的导航。这些神经元以集合的形式发放信号，多个神经元同时发放信号以激活单个头方向或网格。我们希望捕捉这种发放结构，并将其用于解码头方向和网格细胞数据。理解、表示和解码这些神经结构需要包含高阶连接性的模型，而不仅仅是传统基于图的模型提供的一维连接性。为此，我们在这项工作中开发了一个基于拓扑深度学习框架来解码神经突触输出的工具。我们的框架结合了无监督的简单复合体发现和深度学习的强大能力。",
