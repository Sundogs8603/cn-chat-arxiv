    "abstract": "Abstractive summarization is the process of generating a summary given a document as input. Although significant progress has been made, the factual inconsistency between the document and the generated summary still limits its practical applications. Previous work found that the probabilities assigned by the generation model reflect its preferences for the generated summary, including the preference for factual consistency, and the preference for the language or knowledge prior as well. To separate the preference for factual consistency, we propose an unsupervised framework named CoP by controlling the preference of the generation model with the help of prompt. More specifically, the framework performs an extra inference step in which a text prompt is introduced as an additional input. In this way, another preference is described by the generation probability of this extra inference process. The difference between the above two preferences, i.e. the difference between the probabilities",

    "translated_abstract": "抽象化摘要是根据输入文档生成摘要的过程。尽管已经取得了重大进展，但文档与生成的摘要之间的事实不一致性仍然限制了其实际应用。为了分离事实一致性的偏好，我们提出了一个无监督的框架，名为CoP，通过控制提示来控制生成模型的偏好。具体来说，该框架执行一个额外的推理步骤，在其中引入一个文本提示作为额外的输入。通过这种方式，另一个偏好由这个额外推理过程的生成概率描述。利用上述两个偏好之间的差异，即引入文本提示之前和之后的生成模型分配的概率之间的差异，来检测事实不一致性。实验表明，我们提出的CoP可以有效地检测事实不一致性，并在准确性和特异性方面优于现有的最先进模型。",
