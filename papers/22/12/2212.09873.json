    "translated_abstract": "近年来，将眼动数据和其他人类语言处理的隐式测量方法引入自然语言处理（NLP）流程日益受到关注。人类语言处理数据中蕴含了对人类语言理解独特的洞察力，可以被语言模型所利用。然而，关于这些数据的性质以及如何在下游NLP任务中最好地利用它们仍然存在许多未解答的问题。在本文中，我们介绍了eyeStyliency，一个用于研究人类对文体文本（如礼貌性）进行处理的眼动数据集。我们开发了多种方法，利用收集的眼动数据对文本进行风格显著性评分。我们进一步研究了这种显著性数据与人类注释方法和基于模型的解释性指标的比较。我们发现，虽然眼动数据很独特，但它与人类注释和基于模型的重要性评分交集，为人类和机器之间的视角提供了可能的桥梁。",
