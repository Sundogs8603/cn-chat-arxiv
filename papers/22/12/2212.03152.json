    "translated_abstract": "在重复博弈中，策略通常通过它们能否保证事后选择的最佳行动的表现来进行评估，这被称为Hannan一致性或无悔性。然而，单个最佳行动作为评估策略的基准的有效性是有限的，因为在常见的动态环境中，任何静态行动可能表现不佳。因此，我们的工作转向了更为宏大的“动态基准一致性”概念，它保证了选择事后的最佳“动态”行动序列的表现，同时对允许的行动变化次数有限制。我们的主要结果表明，对于所有玩家都采用无悔策略可能出现的任何联合经验分布，存在动态基准一致策略，如果所有玩家都采用这些策略，当时间足够长时，将出现相同的经验分布。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the consistency of joint empirical distribution created by players using no-regret strategies in repeated games, and proposes a dynamic benchmark consistent strategy that guarantees the performance of the best dynamic action sequence with a limited number of allowable action changes. When all players adopt this strategy for a sufficient amount of time, the same empirical distribution emerges."
