    "abstract": "When testing conditions differ from those represented in training data, so-called out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs can mar the reliability of learned components in the modern robot autonomy stack. Therefore, coping with OOD data is an important challenge on the path towards trustworthy learning-enabled open-world autonomy. In this paper, we aim to demystify the topic of OOD data and its associated challenges in the context of data-driven robotic systems, drawing connections to emerging paradigms in the ML community that study the effect of OOD data on learned models in isolation. We argue that as roboticists, we should reason about the overall \\textit{system-level} competence of a robot as it operates in OOD conditions. We highlight key research questions around this system-level view of OOD problems to guide future research toward safe and reliable learning-enabled autonomy.",

    "translated_abstract": "当测试条件与训练数据不一致时，所谓的视域外（OOD）输入可能影响现代机器人自主堆栈中的学习组件的可靠性。因此，应对OOD数据是信任学习启用的开放世界自主性的重要挑战。本文旨在揭示与数据驱动机器人系统中OOD数据及其相关挑战有关的主题，并将其与ML社区中关于OOD数据对孤立的学习模型的影响研究的新兴范式联系起来。我们认为，作为机器人学家，我们应该考虑机器人在OOD条件下的整体系统层面的能力。我们强调围绕OOD问题的系统层面观点的关键研究问题，以指导未来安全可靠的学习启用自主性研究。",
