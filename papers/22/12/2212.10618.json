    "abstract": "We introduce a language generation task grounded in a popular video game environment. KNUDGE (KNowledge Constrained User-NPC Dialogue GEneration) requires models to produce trees of dialogue between video game characters that accurately reflect quest and entity specifications stated in natural language. KNUDGE is constructed from side quest dialogues drawn directly from game data of Obsidian Entertainment's The Outer Worlds, leading to real-world complexities in generation: (1) dialogues are branching trees as opposed to linear chains of utterances; (2) utterances must remain faithful to the game lore- character personas, backstories, and entity relationships; and (3) a dialogue must accurately reveal new quest details to the human player. We report results for a set of neural generation models using supervised and in-context learning techniques; we find competent performance but room for future work addressing the challenges of creating realistic, game-quality dialogues.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一项与流行视频游戏环境相关的语言生成任务。KNUDGE (KNowledge Constrained User-NPC Dialogue GEneration) 要求模型产生反映自然语言中规定任务和实体规范的视频游戏角色之间对话树。KNUDGE 是从 Obsidian Entertainment's The Outer Worlds 的游戏数据中直接提取的副任务对话构建的，导致在生成过程中存在现实世界的复杂性：(1) 对话是分支树，而不是线性的发言链; (2) 话语必须忠实于游戏世界——角色形象、背景和实体关系;以及(3) 对话必须准确地向玩家揭示新的任务细节。我们报告了一组使用监督和上下文学习技术的神经生成模型的结果；我们发现这些模型可以胜任这个任务但还存在改进空间，以应对创建逼真的、高质量的游戏对话方面的挑战。",
