    "abstract": "Whether based on models, training data or a combination, classifiers place (possibly complex) input data into one of a relatively small number of output categories. In this paper, we study the structure of the boundary--those points for which a neighbor is classified differently--in the context of an input space that is a graph, so that there is a concept of neighboring inputs, The scientific setting is a model-based naive Bayes classifier for DNA reads produced by Next Generation Sequencers. We show that the boundary is both large and complicated in structure. We create a new measure of uncertainty, called Neighbor Similarity, that compares the result for a point to the distribution of results for its neighbors. This measure not only tracks two inherent uncertainty measures for the Bayes classifier, but also can be implemented, at a computational cost, for classifiers without inherent measures of uncertainty.",

    "translated_abstract": "无论基于模型、训练数据还是二者组合，分类器将（可能复杂的）输入数据归入相对较少的输出类别之一。本文研究在输入空间为图的情况下，边界的结构——那些被分类为不同类别的邻近点——的特性。我们的科学背景是基于模型的朴素贝叶斯分类器，用于处理由下一代测序仪生成的DNA读数。我们展示了边界既是巨大的，又具有复杂的结构。我们创建了一种新的不确定性度量，称为邻居相似度，它将一个点的结果与其邻居的结果分布进行比较。这个度量不仅追踪了贝叶斯分类器的两个固有不确定性度量，还可以在没有固有不确定性度量的分类器上实现，但需要计算成本。",
