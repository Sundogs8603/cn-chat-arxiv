    "abstract": "Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems have been widely deployed in many industries as they deliver more efficient customer support. These systems are typically constructed for a single domain or language and do not generalise well beyond this. To support work on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in TOD across multiple languages and domains simultaneously, we constructed MULTI3NLU++, a multilingual, multi-intent, multi-domain dataset. MULTI3NLU++ extends the English only NLU++ dataset to include manual translations into a range of high, medium, and low resource languages (Spanish, Marathi, Turkish and Amharic), in two domains (BANKING and HOTELS). Because of its multi-intent property, MULTI3NLU++ represents complex and natural user goals, and therefore allows us to measure the realistic performance of TOD systems in a varied set of the world's languages. We use MULTI3NLU++ to benchmark state-of-the-art multilingual models for the NLU tasks of intent detection and slot labelling for TO",

    "translated_abstract": "任务导向对话系统已经被广泛地应用于许多行业中，因为它们能够提供更有效的客户支持。这些系统通常是为单个领域或语言构建的，并且在这些领域之外的推广能力很差。为了同时支持跨多种语言和领域的任务导向对话中的自然语言理解工作，我们构建了 MULTI3NLU++，这是一个多语言、多意图、多域数据集。MULTI3NLU++ 将仅限于英语的 NLU++ 数据集扩展到多种高、中、低资源语言（西班牙语、马拉地语、土耳其语和阿姆哈拉语）以及两个领域（银行和酒店）中的手动翻译。由于 MULTI3NLU++ 具有多意图的属性，因此它代表了复杂和自然的用户目标，从而使我们能够在世界语言中的各种领域中衡量 TOD 系统的现实性能。我们使用 MULTI3NLU++ 来基准测试用于意图检测和槽位标记的 NLU 任务的最先进的多语言模型。",
