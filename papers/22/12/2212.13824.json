    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a multi-realism image compression method that controls the trade-off between distortion and realism using a conditional generator, allowing for the generation of realistic images and addressing the issue of previously uncontrollable synthesized details. The method achieves state-of-the-art results in distortion-realism."
