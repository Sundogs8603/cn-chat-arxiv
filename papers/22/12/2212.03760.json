    "abstract": "Recent studies have proposed unified user modeling frameworks that leverage user behavior data from various applications. Many of them benefit from utilizing users' behavior sequences as plain texts, representing rich information in any domain or system without losing generality. Hence, a question arises: Can language modeling for user history corpus help improve recommender systems? While its versatile usability has been widely investigated in many domains, its applications to recommender systems still remain underexplored. We show that language modeling applied directly to task-specific user histories achieves excellent results on diverse recommendation tasks. Also, leveraging additional task-agnostic user histories delivers significant performance benefits. We further demonstrate that our approach can provide promising transfer learning capabilities for a broad spectrum of real-world recommender systems, even on unseen domains and services.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究提出了利用来自各种应用程序的用户行为数据的统一用户建模框架。其中许多受益于将用户行为序列作为纯文本使用，代表着任何领域或系统中的丰富信息而不失通用性。因此，一个问题产生了：用户历史语言建模能否帮助改善推荐系统？虽然语言建模的多功能性已在许多领域广泛研究，但其在推荐系统中的应用仍未深入探讨。我们展示了直接应用于任务特定用户历史的语言建模在不同的推荐任务上可以取得优异的结果。此外，利用任务无关的用户历史还可以提供显著的性能优势。我们进一步证明了我们的方法可以为广泛的现实世界推荐系统提供有前途的迁移学习能力，甚至在未知域和服务上也可以实现。",
