    "translated_abstract": "随着基于语义的沟通（SemCom）研究的兴起，学术界和工业界对其各个方面（如理论、应用、度量和实现）的兴趣不断增长。本文的目的是提供一个综合性的调查，涵盖了背景和研究分类，以及详细的技术教程。具体而言，我们首先回顾文献并回答关于语义传输的“什么”和“为什么”问题。然后，我们展示了SemCom生态系统，包括历史、理论、度量、数据集和工具包，并介绍了研究方向的分类方式。此外，我们提议通过显式和隐式基于推理的方法对关键的启用技术进行分类，并详细阐述它们如何演变并为现代内容和通道语义驱动的通信做出贡献。除了回顾和总结最新的e技术，我们还提供了未来的展望和应用场景。",
