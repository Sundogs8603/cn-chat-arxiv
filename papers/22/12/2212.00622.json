    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）已成为一种具有数据隐私优势的有前途的分布式学习范式。随着对数据所有者之间合作的兴趣增加，FL已引起组织的重视。FL的想法是使合作参与者在不泄露隐私的情况下，在分散的数据上训练机器学习（ML）模型。简单地说，联邦学习是“将模型带到数据，而不是将数据带到模型”的方法。当联邦学习应用于垂直分区的数据时，它能够通过组合使用各地点具有不同特征的本地模型训练的模型来建立完整的ML模型。这种FL的架构被称为垂直联邦学习（VFL），它不同于水平分区的传统FL。由于VFL与传统FL不同，因此它具有自身的问题和挑战。本文对现有研究中关于垂直联邦学习的结构化文献综述，分析了VFL的当前研究现状、应用、限制和未来方向。",
