    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个应用深度强化学习的模因算法，用于解决实际双资源约束柔性作业车间调度问题（DRC-FJSSP）。近年来，对于DRL技术已经进行了广泛的研究，但是没有考虑到现实、灵活和以人为中心的车间。本文发现，在以订单为导向的间歇性制造中存在一个研究空白，它经常在具有高服务水平的中小型公司中表示。从这一领域的实际工业项目中，我们认识到需要描述灵活的机器、人工工作者和能力、设置和处理操作、物料到达时间、具有并行任务的复杂作业路径以进行物料清单（BOM）制造、顺序相关设置时间和（部分）自动化任务。另一方面，在DRC-FJSSP的背景下，已经进行了大量的元启发式研究。然而，缺乏适当的方法来解决生产过程的复杂性和不确定性，这是现实工业世界中面临的主要挑战。因此，提出了一种新的算法，以弥补相关领域的缺陷。",
