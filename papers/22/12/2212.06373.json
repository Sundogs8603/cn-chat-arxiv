    "abstract": "Current approaches to empathetic response generation typically encode the entire dialogue history directly and put the output into a decoder to generate friendly feedback. These methods focus on modelling contextual information but neglect capturing the direct intention of the speaker. We argue that the last utterance in the dialogue empirically conveys the intention of the speaker. Consequently, we propose a novel model named InferEM for empathetic response generation. We separately encode the last utterance and fuse it with the entire dialogue through the multi-head attention based intention fusion module to capture the speaker's intention. Besides, we utilize previous utterances to predict the last utterance, which simulates human's psychology to guess what the interlocutor may speak in advance. To balance the optimizing rates of the utterance prediction and response generation, a multi-task learning strategy is designed for InferEM. Experimental results demonstrate the plausibility",

    "translated_abstract": "目前，共情回复生成的方法一般直接编码整个对话历史，然后通过解码器生成友好的反馈。这些方法强调建模情境信息，但忽视了捕捉说话者的直接意图。我们认为对话中最后一次发言表达了说话者的意图。因此，我们提出了一种名为InferEM的新模型用于共情回复生成。我们将最后一次发言单独编码，通过基于多头注意力的意图融合模块与整个对话融合以捕捉说话者的意图。此外，我们利用前几次发言预测最后一次发言，以模拟人类的心理，猜测对话者可能提前说些什么。为平衡发言预测和回复生成的优化速率，InferEM还设计了一种多任务学习策略。实验结果证明了该模型的可行性。",

The model also utilizes previous utterances to predict the last utterance, achieving high plausibility."
