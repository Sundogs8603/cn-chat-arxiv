However, when applied to several cohomology classes, the output circle-valued maps can be \"geometrically correlated\" even if the chosen cohomology classes are linearly independent. It is shown in the original work that less correlated maps can be obtained with suitable integer linear combinations of the cohomology classes, with the linear combinations being chosen by inspection. In this paper, we identify a formal notion of geometric correlation between circle-valued maps which, in the Riemannian manifold case, corresponds to the Dirichlet form, a bilinear form derived from the Dirichlet energy.

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文研究了应用环面坐标算法的问题，研究发现当应用于多个上同调类时，即使所选定的上同调类是线性无关的，输出的环面值图也可能会被几何相关。研究表明，通过适当的上同调类的整数线性组合可以获得较不相关的映射。本文提出了圆值图形的几何相关性概念，该概念在黎曼流形情况下对应于狄利克雷形式，这是从狄利克雷能量导出的双线性形式。作者描述了一个系统性的过程，用于构建最小能量的环面值图。",
