    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了语义分割校准的问题。虽然已经提出了很多解决方案来处理图像分类置信度的模型误校准，但至今为止，对语义分割的置信度校准研究仍然很有限。我们对语义分割模型的校准进行了系统研究，并提出了一种简单而有效的方法。首先，我们发现模型容量、裁剪大小、多尺度测试和预测正确性对校准有影响。其中，预测正确性，特别是错误预测，对由于过度置信而导致的误校准更为重要。接下来，我们提出了一种简单、统一且有效的方法，即选择性缩放，通过将正确/错误预测分开进行缩放，并更加关注错误预测的逻辑平滑。然后，我们研究了流行的现有校准方法，并将它们与选择性缩放在语义分割校准上进行比较。我们进行了大量实验，使用了多种数据集和语义分割模型，以验证我们提出的方法的有效性。",
