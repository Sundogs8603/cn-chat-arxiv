    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）最初用于节点分类，也激发了许多关于边缘预测（即链路预测）的最新研究。然而，现有方法在关于这两个任务的区别方面缺乏精细的设计，这一点常常被忽视：（i）对于节点分类任务而言，边仅构成拓扑结构，但在边缘预测任务中既可以作为拓扑结构，也可以作为监督信号（即标签）；（ii）节点分类是对每个节点进行预测，而边缘预测则由每对节点决定。为此，我们提出了一种称为边缘感知消息传递神经网络（EMPIRE）的新型边缘预测范式。具体而言，我们首先引入一种边缘拆分技术来指定每个边的使用方式，其中每个边仅用作拓扑结构或监督信号（分别称为拓扑边或监督边）。然后，我们开发了一种新的消息传递机制，生成消息的传递的过程。",
