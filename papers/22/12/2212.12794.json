    "abstract": "Global medium-range weather forecasting is critical to decision-making across many social and economic domains. Traditional numerical weather prediction uses increased compute resources to improve forecast accuracy, but cannot directly use historical weather data to improve the underlying model. We introduce a machine learning-based method called \"GraphCast\", which can be trained directly from reanalysis data. It predicts hundreds of weather variables, over 10 days at 0.25 degree resolution globally, in under one minute. We show that GraphCast significantly outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems on 90% of 1380 verification targets, and its forecasts support better severe event prediction, including tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, and extreme temperatures. GraphCast is a key advance in accurate and efficient weather forecasting, and helps realize the promise of machine learning for modeling complex dynamical systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "全球中程天气预报对于很多社会和经济领域的决策至关重要。传统的数值天气预报利用增加的计算资源提高预报准确性，但无法直接利用历史天气数据改进底层模型。我们引入了一个名为\"GraphCast\"的基于机器学习的方法，它可以直接从再分析数据中进行训练。它在不到一分钟的时间内，预测全球0.25度分辨率下的数百个天气变量，持续10天。我们表明GraphCast在1380个验证目标的90％上明显优于最准确的操作确定性系统，并且其预报支持更好的严重事件预测，包括热带气旋、大气河流和极端温度。GraphCast是准确和高效的天气预报的关键进展，并有助于实现机器学习在建模复杂动力系统方面的优势。",
