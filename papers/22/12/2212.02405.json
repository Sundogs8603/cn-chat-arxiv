    "translated_abstract": "MD4和MD5是在1990年代初提出的具有里程碑意义的密码哈希函数。MD4由48个步骤组成，给定任意有限大小的消息，它可以产生一个128位的哈希值。MD5是MD4的更安全的64步扩展。尽管MD4和MD5都容易受到碰撞攻击的影响，但是翻转它们，即通过哈希值找到原始消息仍然不现实。在2007年，MD4的39步版本通过化简为SAT并应用CDCL求解器以及所谓的Dobbertin约束被反转。至于MD5，在2012年，它的28步版本通过CDCL求解器仅针对一个特定的哈希值被反转，而不加任何额外的约束。本研究将立方和征服（CDCL与先行搜索的组合）应用于步骤缩减版本的MD4和MD5的反转。为此，提出了两个算法。第一个算法通过逐步修改Dobbertin约束来生成MD4的反转问题。第二个算法尝试使用立方阶段的立方和征服方法进行反转。",
