    "translated_abstract": "人工智能的两种方法，神经网络和符号系统，对于一系列AI问题已经被证明非常成功。然而，两者均未能达到人类智能所需的通用推理能力。人们认为这是每种方法内在弱点所致。幸运的是，这些弱点似乎是互补的，符号系统擅长神经网络难以处理的事物，反之亦然。神经符号AI领域试图利用这种不对称性通过将神经网络和符号AI相结合成为综合系统。通常这是通过将符号知识编码到神经网络中实现的。不幸的是，虽然提出了许多不同的方法来实现这一点，但没有公共的编码定义可供比较。我们通过引入神经符号AI的语义框架来解决这个问题，然后证明它足以解释大量神经符号系统。我们的框架是基于符号系统植根于其领域的神经表征的概念。我们展示了我们的框架可以解释各种符号系统在神经表征中的实现方式，包括使用学习的神经表征和使用固定神经表征的系统。",
