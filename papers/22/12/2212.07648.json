    "translated_abstract": "人类建模和再照明领域是计算机视觉和计算机图形学中的两个基础性难题。高质量的数据集可以极大地促进相关研究。然而，大多数现有的人类数据集只提供在相同照明下捕获的多角度图像，虽然对于建模任务具有价值，但并不适用于再照明问题。为了推动两个领域的研究，本文提出了 UltraStage，一个新的三维人类数据集，其中包含超过 2,000 个高质量的人类资产，这些人类资产都是在多视角和多照明设置下捕获的。具体地，对于每个示例，我们提供了32个周围视角，其中一个是白光照明，另外两个是渐变照明。除了常规的多视角图像外，渐变照明还有助于恢复详细的表面法线和空间变化材质贴图，从而实现各种再照明应用。受到神经表示法的最新进展的启发，我们进一步将每个示例解释为神经人类资产，可以在实时下具有灵活性地任意重照。据我们所知，这是第一个高质量、多样化和灵活性高的既适用于人类建模又适用于再照明的大规模人类数据集。",

The latest advances in neural representation interpret each example into a neural human assets which can be relit under arbitrary novel illuminations in real-time. This is the first large-scale human dataset that enables both human modeling and relighting with high quality, diversity, and flexibility."
