    "translated_abstract": "柔性机器人可以解决一些工业领域的主要挑战，如实现固有安全的人机协作和实现更高的负载重量比。然而，由于其复杂的动力学特性，包括振荡行为和高维状态空间，控制柔性机器人非常复杂。非线性模型预测控制(NMPC)能够有效控制此类机器人，但其计算需求较高常常限制其在实时场景中的应用。为了实现对柔性机器人的快速控制，我们提出了一种使用模仿学习和预测安全过滤器进行NMPC的安全近似的框架。我们的框架显著减少了计算时间，同时在性能上略有损失。与NMPC相比，在模拟中控制一个三维柔性机械臂时，我们的框架在计算时间上改善了8倍以上，同时保证了安全约束。值得注意的是，我们的方法优于传统的强化学习方法。",
