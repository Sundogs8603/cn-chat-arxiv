    "translated_abstract": "众包是将人类智力和生产力动态组织起来处理自动化无法解决的复杂任务的一种方式，它已成为一个重要的研究课题，并激发了新的商业模式（如Uber、Airbnb）。多年来，众包不再仅仅是提供一个平台来手动匹配工作者和任务，而是借助数据驱动的人工智能算法管理方法，实现日益复杂的优化目标。本文提供了一份调查报告，对如何将人工智能赋能于众包以提高效率进行了系统概述，我们将其称为以人工智能为驱动的众包（AIEC）。我们提出了一个将AIEC划分为三个主要领域的分类法：1）任务委托，2）激励工作者，3）质量控制，重点关注需要实现的主要目标。我们讨论了限制因素和洞见，并梳理了进行研究的挑战。",
