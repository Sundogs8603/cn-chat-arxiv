    "translated_abstract": "领域适应旨在将在（数据丰富）源领域学到的知识转移到（资源有限）目标领域，一种常用的方法是不变表示学习，它匹配并对齐特征空间上的数据分布。尽管这种方法在分类和回归问题上得到了广泛研究和应用，但在排名问题上的应用却是零散的，并且现有的几种实现缺乏理论上的证明。本文重新审视了用于排名的不变表示学习。在审查之前的工作时，我们发现他们实施了我们称之为项目级别对齐的方法，该方法在聚合的所有列表中对进行排名的项目分布进行对齐，但忽略了列表的结构。然而，列表的结构应该被利用，因为它是排名问题的固有特性，其中数据和度量是在列表上定义和计算的，而不是在项目本身上。为了解决这一不一致，我们提出了列表级别对齐的学习",
