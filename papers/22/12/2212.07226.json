    "abstract": "One popular technique to solve temporal planning problems consists in decoupling the causal decisions, demanding them to heuristic search, from temporal decisions, demanding them to a simple temporal network (STN) solver. In this architecture, one needs to check the consistency of a series of STNs that are related one another, therefore having methods to incrementally re-use previous computations and that avoid expensive memory duplication is of paramount importance. In this paper, we describe in detail how STNs are used in temporal planning, we identify a clear interface to support this use-case and we present an efficient data-structure implementing this interface that is both time- and memory-efficient. We show that our data structure, called \\deltastn, is superior to other state-of-the-art approaches on temporal planning sequences of problems.",

    "translated_abstract": "解决时态规划问题的一种常用技术是将因果决策与启发式搜索分离，将时态决策交由简单时态网络(STN)求解器处理。在这种架构中，需要检查一系列互相关联的STN的一致性，因此具有增量重用之前的计算和避免昂贵的内存复制的方法非常重要。本文详细描述了STN在时态规划中的使用方法，确定了支持此用例的明确接口，并介绍了一种既时间又内存高效的实现了此接口的高效数据结构---\\deltastn。我们展示了我们的数据结构在时态规划问题序列上优于其他最先进方法。",
