    "abstract": "Xenophobia is one of the key drivers of marginalisation, discrimination, and conflict, yet many prominent machine learning (ML) fairness frameworks fail to comprehensively measure or mitigate the resulting xenophobic harms. Here we aim to bridge this conceptual gap and help facilitate safe and ethical design of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. We ground our analysis of the impact of xenophobia by first identifying distinct types of xenophobic harms, and then applying this framework across a number of prominent AI application domains, reviewing the potential interplay between AI and xenophobia on social media and recommendation systems, healthcare, immigration, employment, as well as biases in large pre-trained models. These help inform our recommendations towards an inclusive, xenophilic design of future AI systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "排外主义是边缘化、歧视和冲突的关键驱动因素之一，然而许多著名的机器学习（ML）公平性框架未能全面衡量或减轻由此导致的排外主义危害。在这里，我们旨在弥合这一概念上的差距，并帮助促进人工智能（AI）解决方案的安全和道德设计。我们通过首先确定不同类型的排外主义危害来基于实际情况分析排外主义的影响，然后将此框架应用于许多著名的AI应用领域，并审查社交媒体和推荐系统、医疗保健、移民、就业以及大型预训练模型中AI与排外主义之间的潜在相互作用。这有助于为未来AI系统的包容、友善设计提供建议。",
