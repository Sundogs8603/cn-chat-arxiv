    "translated_abstract": "机器生成文本（MGT）检测是一项将MGT与人工编写文本（HWT）区分开的任务，在防止文本生成模型被滥用方面起着关键作用，这些模型最近在模仿人类写作风格方面表现出色。最新提出的检测器通常将粗糙的文本序列作为输入，并通过标准的交叉熵损失对预训练模型进行微调。然而，这些方法未能考虑到文本的语言结构。此外，它们也缺乏处理低资源问题的能力，考虑到在线文本数据的庞大量，低资源问题在实践中往往会经常发生。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于一致性的对比学习模型CoCo，用于在低资源情况下检测可能的MGT。为了利用语言特征，我们将一致性信息以图形的形式编码到文本表示中。为了解决低数据资源的挑战，我们采用对比学习框架，并提出了一种改进的对比损失来防止性能下降。",
