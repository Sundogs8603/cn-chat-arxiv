    "translated_abstract": "通过从大规模、多样化、任务无关的数据集中获取知识，现代机器学习模型可以在零样本学习或使用少量特定任务的数据集来高水平地解决具体的下游任务。虽然这种能力已经在计算机视觉、自然语言处理或语音识别等其他领域得到证明，但在机器人领域尚未展示出来。这是因为模型的泛化能力在机器人领域尤为关键，由于收集现实世界的机器人数据的难度较大。我们认为，这种通用机器人模型成功的一个关键因素在于任务不可知的开放式训练，结合可以吸收所有多样化机器人数据的高容量架构。在本文中，我们提出了一种称为机器人变压器的模型类，具有良好的可扩展模型特性。我们通过研究不同模型类别及其随数据大小而推广的能力来验证我们的结论。",
