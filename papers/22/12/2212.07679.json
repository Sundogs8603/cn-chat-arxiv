    "translated_abstract": "固定半径近邻搜索是一种基本的数据操作，用于检索到查询点在用户指定距离内的所有数据点。目前存在一些高效的算法可以提供快速的近似查询响应，但它们通常具有计算密集型的索引阶段，并且需要仔细的参数调整。因此，精确的暴力搜索和基于树的搜索方法仍然被广泛使用。本文提出了一种新的固定半径近邻搜索方法SNN，在索引和查询时间方面显著改进了暴力搜索和基于树的方法，能够准确返回结果，并且无需参数调整。SNN利用数据点根据其第一主成分进行排序，从而修剪查询搜索空间。通过使用高级的基础线性代数子程序（BLAS）的高效实现，进一步提速。我们提供了该方法的理论分析，并展示了它在独立使用和与其他方法结合使用时的实际性能。",
