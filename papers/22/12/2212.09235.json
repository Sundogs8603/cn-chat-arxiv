    "translated_abstract": "由于心理健康支持的人力资源短缺，越来越需要使用会话代理程序进行支持。最近的研究已经证明了对话模型在提供情感支持方面的有效性。由于以往的研究已经证明求助者的人格是有效支持的重要因素，因此我们调查了在支持对话模型中建模此类信息是否有益。本文的实证分析验证了人格对情感支持的重要影响。因此，我们提出了一种动态推断和建模求助者人格的框架。我们首先训练了一个从对话历史中推断求助者人格的模型。因此，我们提出了PAL，这是一个利用人格信息和我们基于策略的可控生成方法，提供个性化情感支持的模型。自动和手动评估表明，PAL在情感支持对话生成方面取得了最先进的性能。",
