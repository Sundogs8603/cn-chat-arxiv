    "translated_abstract": "作者风格转移是指将文本改写成目标作者的风格，同时保留原始意思。现有的无监督方法大多专注于将风格转移到在书籍、演讲或其他已发表作品中具有许多示例的目标作者身上。这种高资源的训练数据要求（通常大于10万个词）使得这些方法主要适用于将风格转移到已发表的作家、政治家或其他知名人士和作者风格上，而转移到非知名作者的风格尚未得到充分研究。我们提出了“低资源条件下的作者风格转移”任务，这是一类更具挑战性的作者风格转移，仅存在有限数量的目标作者风格文本。在我们的实验中，我们特别选择了Reddit上的源作者和目标作者，并对他们的Reddit帖子进行风格转移，限制自己仅使用了16篇帖子（平均约500个词）的数据。",
