    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an unsupervised query enhanced approach for knowledge-intensive conversations, namely QKConv. There are three modules in QKConv: a query generator, an off-the-shelf knowledge selector, and a response generator. QKConv is optimized through joint training, which produces the response by exploring multiple candidate queries and leveraging corresponding selected knowledge. The joint training solely relies on the dialogue context and target response, getting exempt from extra query annotations or knowledge provenances. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed QKConv, we conduct experiments on three representative knowledge-intensive conversation datasets: conversational question-answering, task-oriented dialogue, and knowledge-grounded conversation. Experimental results reveal that QKConv performs better than all unsupervised methods across three datasets and achieves competitive performance compared to supervised methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种无监督查询增强方法——QKConv，用于知识密集型对话。QKConv包含三个模块：查询生成器、通用知识选择器和响应生成器。QKConv通过联合训练进行优化，通过探索多个候选查询并利用相应的选择的知识来生成响应。联合训练仅依赖于对话上下文和目标响应，免除了额外的查询注释或知识来源。为了评估所提出的QKConv的有效性，我们在三个代表性的知识密集型对话数据集上进行了实验：对话问答、任务导向对话和基于知识的对话。实验结果表明，在三个数据集上，QKConv的表现比所有无监督方法都要好，并且与有监督方法具有竞争性的性能。",
