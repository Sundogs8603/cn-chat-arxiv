    "translated_abstract": "偏微分方程广泛用于描述物理和工程现象。PDE中涉及的一些关键参数代表具有重要科学解释的特定物理性质，直接测量这些参数是困难甚至不可能的。从与相关物理量的嘈杂和稀疏实验数据中估计这些参数是一项重要任务。许多PDE参数推断方法涉及通过有限元方法等算法对PDE的数值解进行大量评估，这可能非常耗时，特别是对于非线性PDE。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的PDE中未知参数推断方法，称为基于PDE信息的高斯过程（PIGP）基于参数推断方法。通过将PDE解建模为高斯过程（GP），我们得到了（线性）PDE结构引起的流形约束，使得在约束条件下，GP满足PDE。",
