    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel framework for certifying the fairness of predictive models trained on biased data. It draws from query answering for incomplete and inconsistent databases to formulate the problem of consistent range approximation (CRA) of fairness queries for a predictive model on a target population. The framework employs background knowledge of the data collection process and biased data, working with or without limited statistics about the target population, to compute a range of answers for fairness queries. Using CRA, the framework builds predictive models that are certifiably fair on the target population, regardless of the availability of external data during training. The framework's efficacy is demonstrated through evaluations on real data, showing substantial improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个新颖的框架，用于验证基于有偏数据训练的预测模型的公平性。它借鉴了对不完整和不一致数据库的查询回答，以形式化公平查询在目标人群上的一致范围逼近（CRA）问题。该框架利用数据收集过程和有偏数据的背景知识，可以在有限的目标人群统计数据的情况下，计算公平查询的答案范围。通过CRA，该框架构建的预测模型可以在目标人群上获得可证明的公平性，而不受训练过程中外部数据的可用性限制。通过对真实数据的评估，验证了该框架的有效性，显示出明显优于现有最先进方法的改进。",
