    "translated_abstract": "在任何辩论中，无论是对人类还是AI系统来说，优化论据的传递是说服的关键。这要求使用与辩论相关的清晰流畅的主张。之前的研究已经广泛研究了论据质量的自动评估，然而迄今为止没有一种方法能够实际改善质量。为了填补这一空白，本文提出了主张优化的任务：重新撰写论证性主张以优化其传递。由于存在多种优化类型，我们首先使用大型语言模型（如BART）生成一个多样化的候选主张集合，考虑到上下文信息。然后，使用各种质量指标选择最佳候选主张。在英语语料库的自动评估和人工评估中，我们基于质量的候选主张选择优于几种基准线，改善了60％的所有主张（仅恶化了16％）。后续分析表明，除了复制编辑外，我们的方法通常更加具体。",
