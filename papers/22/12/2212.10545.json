    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose DimonGen, which aims to generate diverse sentences describing concept relationships in various everyday scenarios. To support this, we first create a benchmark dataset for this task by adapting the existing CommonGen dataset. We then propose a two-stage model called MoREE to generate the target sentences. MoREE consists of a mixture of retrievers model that retrieves diverse context sentences related to the given concepts, and a mixture of generators model that generates diverse sentences based on the retrieved contexts. We conduct experiments on the DimonGen task and show that MoREE outperforms strong baselines in terms of both the quality and diversity of the generated sentences. Our results demonstrate that MoREE is able to generate diverse sentences that reflect different relationships between concepts, leading to a comprehensive understanding of concept relationships.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了DimonGen，旨在生成描述各种日常场景中概念关系的多样化句子。为此，我们首先通过改编现有的CommonGen数据集创建了一个基准数据集。然后，我们提出了一个名为MoREE的两阶段模型来生成目标句子。MoREE包含一种混合检索模型，该模型检索与给定概念相关的多样性上下文句子，以及一种混合生成器模型，该模型基于检索到的上下文生成多样化的句子。我们在DimonGen任务上进行了实验，并展示了MoREE在生成的句子的质量和多样性方面优于强基线模型。我们的结果表明，MoREE能够生成反映概念之间不同关系的多样化句子，从而实现对概念关系的全面理解。",
