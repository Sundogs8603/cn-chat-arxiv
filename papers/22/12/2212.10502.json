    "abstract": "Language modeling, a central task in natural language processing, involves estimating a probability distribution over strings. In most cases, the estimated distribution sums to 1 over all finite strings. However, in some pathological cases, probability mass can ``leak'' onto the set of infinite sequences. In order to characterize the notion of leakage more precisely, this paper offers a measure-theoretic treatment of language modeling. We prove that many popular language model families are in fact tight, meaning that they will not leak in this sense. We also generalize characterizations of tightness proposed in previous works.",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理中的核心任务之一是语言建模，涉及对字符串的概率分布进行估计。在大多数情况下，估计的分布在所有有限字符串上求和等于1。然而，在某些病态情况下，概率质量可能“泄漏”到无限序列集合上。为了更精确地刻画泄漏的概念，本文提出了一种测度论的语言建模处理方法。我们证明了许多流行的语言模型家族实际上是紧密的，也就是说它们在这个意义上不会泄漏。我们还推广了之前工作中提出的紧密性特征化方法。",
