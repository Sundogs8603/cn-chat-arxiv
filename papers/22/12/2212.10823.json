    "translated_abstract": "关系提取（RE）依赖结构化注释语料库进行模型训练，尤其在低资源情况和领域中，该任务具有挑战性。近期研究通过自监督学习来解决低资源的RE，其中解决方案包括通过RE目标预训练关系嵌入，并通过分类为基础的目标对有标签数据进行微调。然而，这种方法的一个关键挑战是目标之间的差距，它阻止RE模型充分利用预训练表示中的知识。本文旨在弥合差距，并提出使用一致的对比学习目标预训练和微调RE模型。由于在这种表示学习范式中，一个关系可能在表示空间中轻松形成多个聚类，因此我们进一步提出了多中心对比损失，允许一个关系形成多个聚类以更好地对齐预训练。在两个文档中的实验表明，所提出的方法可以在低资源情况和领域中显着提高关系提取性能。",
