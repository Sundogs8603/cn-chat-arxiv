Principally, the problems are translated to higher-order logic in the TPTP language using an embedding approach, and solved using higher-order logic ATP systems. Additionally, the results from native modal logic ATP systems are considered, and compared with those from the embedding approach. The findings are that the embedding process is reliable and successful, the choice of backend ATP system can significantly impact the performance of the embedding approach, native modal logic ATP systems outperform the embedding approach, and the embedding approach can cope with a wider range modal logics than the native modal systems considered.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文描述了对自动定理证明 (ATP) 系统在从 QMLTP 一阶模态逻辑问题库中取出的问题上的评估。主要是将问题使用嵌入方法翻译为 TPTP 语言中的高阶逻辑，并使用高阶逻辑 ATP 系统进行求解。此外，还考虑了来自本地模态逻辑 ATP 系统的结果，并与嵌入方法的结果进行了比较。研究发现，嵌入过程可靠且成功，后端 ATP 系统的选择会显著影响嵌入方法的性能，本地模态逻辑 ATP 系统优于嵌入方法，而嵌入方法可以处理比所考虑的本地模态系统更广泛的模态逻辑问题。",
