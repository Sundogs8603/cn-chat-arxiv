    "abstract": "Previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of planning for story generation exclusively in a monolingual setting focusing primarily on English. We consider whether planning brings advantages to automatic story generation across languages. We propose a new task of cross-lingual story generation with planning and present a new dataset for this task. We conduct a comprehensive study of different plans and generate stories in several languages, by leveraging the creative and reasoning capabilities of large pre-trained language models. Our results demonstrate that plans which structure stories into three acts lead to more coherent and interesting narratives, while allowing to explicitly control their content and structure.",

    "translated_abstract": "先前的研究已经证明了在单语环境下规划故事生成的有效性，主要集中在英语上。我们考虑在跨语言的自动故事生成中，规划是否带来了优势。我们提出了一个新的跨语言故事生成任务，并为该任务提供了一个新的数据集。我们通过利用大型预训练语言模型的创造和推理能力，对不同的故事规划进行了全面的研究，并在多种语言中生成了故事。我们的结果表明，将故事结构化为三幕的规划可以带来更一致和有趣的叙述，同时允许明确控制其内容和结构。",
