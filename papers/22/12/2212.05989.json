    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal modeling as a canonical task of multivariate time series forecasting has been a significant research topic in AI community. To address the underlying heterogeneity and non-stationarity implied in the graph streams, in this study, we propose Spatio-Temporal Meta-Graph Learning as a novel Graph Structure Learning mechanism on spatio-temporal data. Specifically, we implement this idea into Meta-Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (MegaCRN) by plugging the Meta-Graph Learner powered by a Meta-Node Bank into GCRN encoder-decoder. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on two benchmark datasets (METR-LA and PEMS-BAY) and a large-scale spatio-temporal dataset that contains a variaty of non-stationary phenomena. Our model outperformed the state-of-the-arts to a large degree on all three datasets (over 27% MAE and 34% RMSE). Besides, through a series of qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our model can explicitly disentangle locations and time slots with different patt",
