    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑约束线性逆问题 (LIP)，在二次约束条件下最小化某个原子范数（如$\\ell_1$范数)。通常，这样的成本函数是不可微分的，这使得它们不适合现有的快速优化方法。我们提出了两种等效的约束LIP改进的凸正则化重述：(i)一个光滑的凸优化问题，和(ii)一个强凸的极小极大问题。这些问题可以通过应用现有的基于加速的凸优化方法来解决，这些方法提供更好的$O \\left( \\frac{1}{k^2} \\right)$理论收敛保证，改进了当前最佳速率 $O \\left( \\frac{1}{k} \\right)$。我们还提供了一种名为快速线性逆问题求解器（FLIPS）的新算法，该算法特别针对重述结构进行最大化利用。我们展示了FLIPS在经典的二进制选择问题、压缩感知和图像恢复问题上的性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a fast algorithm for solving constrained linear inverse problems. The algorithm reformulates the problem into a convex optimization problem or a min-max problem, and applies existing optimization methods to achieve better theoretical convergence guarantee. Additionally, a novel algorithm named FLIPS is introduced, which is tailored to optimize the problem structure and demonstrates good performance on various classical problems."
