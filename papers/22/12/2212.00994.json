    "translated_abstract": "由于在许多任务中具有根本作用，知识图谱(KGs)越来越受到关注。因此，对KG的质量评估至关重要且不可或缺。然而，现有领域中的方法通过从不同的维度提出新的质量度量或在KG构建阶段衡量性能来评估KG。但是，这些方法存在两个主要问题。首先，它们高度依赖KG中的原始数据，这使得KG的内部信息在质量评估期间暴露出来。其次，它们更多地考虑数据层面的质量，而不是能力层面的质量，对于下游应用来说，后者更为重要。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个不完整信息下的知识图谱质量评估框架(QEII)。在评估过程中，不暴露任何原始数据，而将质量评估任务转化为两个KG之间的对抗性问答游戏。游戏胜者因此被认为具有更好的质量。",
