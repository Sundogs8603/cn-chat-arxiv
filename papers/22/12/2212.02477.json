The proposed Boosted-BR-STM is based on a new dilated-convolutional block-based split transform merge (STM) and feature-map Squeezing-Boosting (SB) ideas. Moreover, the new STM block uses regional and boundary operations to learn the malaria parasite's homogeneity, heterogeneity, and boundary with patterns.

    "translated_abstract": "疟疾是由雌性按蚊注入的致命疟原虫引起的疾病，感染红细胞，每年在全球数百万人中造成感染。然而，在临床实践中，专家的手动筛查是费力且容易出错的. 因此，开发了一种新的深度增强和集成学习（DBEL）框架，包括新的增强-BR-STM卷积神经网络（CNN）的堆叠和集成ML分类器，用于筛查疟疾寄生虫图像。提出的增强-BR-STM基于新的扩张卷积块分裂变换合并（STM）和特征图挤压增强（SB）思想。此外，新的STM块使用区域和边界操作来学习疟疾寄生虫的同质性、异质性和边界与模式。此外，通过在抽象、中等和边界水平上用基于迁移学习的新特征图SB在STM块中获得多样化的增强通道。",
