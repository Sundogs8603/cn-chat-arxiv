    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了将神经网络与符号推理相结合的问题。最近引入的概率神经符号学习（PNL）框架，如DeepProbLog，执行指数时间的精确推理，限制了PNL解决方案的可扩展性。我们介绍了近似神经符号推理（A-NeSI）：一种新的PNL框架，它使用神经网络进行可扩展的近似推理。A-NeSI 1) 在不改变概率逻辑语义的情况下，以多项式时间执行近似推理；2) 使用由背景知识生成的数据进行训练；3) 可以生成有关预测的符号解释；4) 可以在测试时间保证逻辑约束的满足，这在安全关键应用中非常重要。我们的实验表明，A-NeSI是第一个能够解决具有指数组合扩展的三种神经符号任务的端到端方法。最后，我们的实验表明，A-NeSI实现了可解释性和安全性，而没有惩罚。",
