    "translated_abstract": "本项工作旨在提高涡扇发动机燃油室喷射器的性能，从而意味着提高性能和减少污染物。为了实现实时预测和改善燃油/空气混合物，需要开发允许这种预测的模型。然而，到目前为止所做的工作涉及使用实验数据（难以测量）或完整问题的数值解（计算成本高昂）。后者涉及解决一个偏微分方程（PDE）系统。这些问题使得开发实时预测工具变得困难。因此，在本工作中，我们建议将机器学习与（相对更便宜的）单相流数值模拟结合起来，在存在切向不连续性的情况下估计两相流中的混合过程。在这个意义上，我们研究了两个提出的神经网络（NN）模型作为PDE代理模型的应用。NN通过预测未来动态来实现。",
