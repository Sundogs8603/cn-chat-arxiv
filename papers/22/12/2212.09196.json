    "abstract": "The recent advent of large language models has reinvigorated debate over whether human cognitive capacities might emerge in such generic models given sufficient training data. Of particular interest is the ability of these models to reason about novel problems zero-shot, without any direct training. In human cognition, this capacity is closely tied to an ability to reason by analogy. Here, we performed a direct comparison between human reasoners and a large language model (the text-davinci-003 variant of GPT-3) on a range of analogical tasks, including a novel text-based matrix reasoning task closely modeled on Raven's Progressive Matrices. We found that GPT-3 displayed a surprisingly strong capacity for abstract pattern induction, matching or even surpassing human capabilities in most settings. Our results indicate that large language models such as GPT-3 have acquired an emergent ability to find zero-shot solutions to a broad range of analogy problems.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型的出现重新点燃了人们对于这样一种问题的辩论：足够的训练数据是否能使这些通用模型内涵人类认知能力。特别的，这些模型的零样本推理能力——不经过任何直接训练，就能够推理出新问题，特别令人关注。在人类认知中，这种能力与一种通过类比推理的能力密切相关。在本文中，我们在一系列类比任务中进行了直接的人机比较，包括一种新颖的基于文本的矩阵推理任务，该任务与 Raven's Progressive Matrices密切相关。我们发现，GPT-3呈现出了一种令人惊讶的抽象模式归纳能力，甚至在大部分情况下与或甚至超越了人类的能力。我们的结果表明，像GPT-3这样的大型语言模型已经获得了在广泛的类比问题上找到零样本解决方案的紧急能力。",
