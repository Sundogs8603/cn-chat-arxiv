    "translated_abstract": "一个家庭机器人应该能够在不需要用户先注释家中所有物品的情况下导航到目标物品。目前大多数物品导航的方法并未在真实机器人上进行测试，而是仅依赖于重构的房屋扫描及昂贵标记半监督 3D 网格。本文的目标是通过探索构建机器人自我监督模型，正如儿童会做的一样。因此，我们放弃标记 3D 网格的成本，并在真实世界中启用自我监督现场微调机制。我们确定一个强大的自我监督源（位置一致性 - LocCon）可以训练 ObjectNav 代理中的所有组件，使用未注释的模拟房屋。我们的关键见解是，机身代理可以利用位置一致性作为自我监督信号，收集来自不同视角 /角度的图像，应用对比学习。我们展示了我们的代理程序可以在真实世界和模拟中表现出有竞争力的结果。",
