    "translated_abstract": "区域、社会和经济因素引起的方言差异对许多语言技术用户造成了性能差异。普惠和公平的语言技术必须是临近方言的，这意味着在方言转换时性能保持不变。由于它们的设计和测试都是基于标准美式英语（SAE），目前的系统往往不能达到这个理想状态。我们介绍了一个资源套件，用于评估和实现英式方言临近性，称之为Multi-VALUE，它是一个可控制的基于规则的翻译系统，覆盖了50种英语方言和189个独特的语言特征。Multi-VALUE将SAE映射到每种方言的合成形式。我们首先使用这个系统进行压力测试，测试问答、机器翻译和语义解析。压力测试揭示了在非标准方言上的领先模型的显着性能差距。其次，我们使用这个系统作为数据增强技术以改善性能。",
