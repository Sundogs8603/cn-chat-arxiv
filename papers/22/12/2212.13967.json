    "translated_abstract": "一些最近的人工神经网络(ANN)声称模拟灵长类动物神经和人类的表现数据。然而，它们在对象识别方面的成功依赖于以人类不常采用的方式利用低级特征来解决视觉任务。因此，对于ANN来说，超出分布或对抗性输入经常具有挑战性。相反，人类学习抽象的模式，并且对许多极端图像畸变的影响很小。我们引入了一组新的图像变换，受神经生理学发现的启发，并在对象识别任务上评估了人类和ANN。我们表明，对于某些变换，机器的表现比人类更好，而对于某些对人类简单的变换，机器难以与人类表现相当。我们量化了人类和机器的准确性差异，并为我们的变换数据找到了一个难度排名。我们还建议如何改变人类视觉处理的某些特征以提高ANN的性能。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了一些极端的图像变换，发现机器和人类在这些变换下的表现差异较大，机器在某些变换下比人类表现更好，但在人类容易处理的变换下表现不如人类，同时提出了一些方法来改善机器的性能。"
