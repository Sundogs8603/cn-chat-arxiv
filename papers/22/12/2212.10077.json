    "abstract": "We propose the Detailed Outline Control (DOC) framework for improving long-range plot coherence when automatically generating several-thousand-word-long stories. DOC consists of two complementary components: a detailed outliner and a detailed controller. The detailed outliner creates a more detailed, hierarchically structured outline, shifting creative burden from the main drafting procedure to the planning stage. The detailed controller ensures the more detailed outline is still respected during generation by controlling story passages to align with outline details. In human evaluations of automatically generated stories, DOC substantially outperforms a strong Re3 baseline (Yang et al., 2022) on plot coherence (22.5% absolute gain), outline relevance (28.2%), and interestingness (20.7%). Humans also judged DOC to be much more controllable in an interactive generation setting.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个称为 Detailed Outline Control(DOC)的框架，以提高生成数千字长的故事时的长程情节连贯性。DOC由两个互补组件组成：详细大纲和详细控制器。详细大纲创建一个更详细、层次化的大纲，将创造性负担从主要起草过程转移到规划阶段。详细控制器通过控制故事段落与大纲细节对齐，确保更详细的大纲在生成过程中仍然被尊重。在自动生成的故事的人类评估中，DOC在情节连贯性(22.5% 绝对增益)、大纲相关性(28.2%)和趣味性(20.7%)方面显著优于强大的Re3基线(Yang等人，2022)。人们还评价DOC在交互生成设置方面更易于控制。",
