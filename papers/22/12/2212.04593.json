    "translated_abstract": "机器学习软件在现代社会被广泛采用，但存在可能基于种族、性别、年龄等因素影响少数群体公平性的问题。最近的许多研究提出了衡量和减轻机器学习模型算法偏见的方法，但现实中的机器学习模型往往由多个独立或相关联的学习器组成（如随机森林），其中的公平性组合方式非常复杂。公平性如何在集成中组合？学习器对集成最终公平性的影响是什么？公平的学习器是否会导致不公平的集成？此外，研究表明超参数对机器学习模型的公平性产生影响。集成超参数更为复杂，因为它们影响学习器在不同类别的集成中的组合方式。深入了解集成超参数对公平性的影响将有助于程序员设计公平的集成模型。本文研究了集成机器学习中的公平性及其组成方式，并基于条件人口平等的概念提出了一种新颖的方法来衡量集成模型的公平性。此外，我们还评估了单个学习器和集成超参数对公平性的影响。我们的实验表明，公平性在集成中的组成方式是非线性的，超参数的选择可以显著影响集成模型的公平性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates fairness and its composition in ensemble machine learning, proposes a novel approach to measure the fairness of ensemble models, and evaluates the impacts of individual learners and ensemble hyperparameters on fairness. The experiments demonstrate that fairness can compose nonlinearly in ensembles, and the choice of hyperparameters can significantly affect the fairness of ensemble models."
