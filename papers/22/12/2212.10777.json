To take advantage of this structure, we propose hierarchically branched diffusion models as a novel framework for class-conditional generation. Branched diffusion models explicitly leverage the inherent relationships between distinct classes in the dataset to learn the underlying diffusion process in a hierarchical manner. We highlight several advantages of branched diffusion models over the current state-of-the-art methods for class-conditional diffusion. Firstly, they can be easily extended to novel classes in a continual-learning setting at scale. Secondly, they",
