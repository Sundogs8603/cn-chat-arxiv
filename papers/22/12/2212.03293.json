    "translated_abstract": "随着对三维虚拟建模技术的关注不断增加，基于特定条件（如文本）生成新颖的三维内容已成为热门问题。本文提出了一种名为Diffusion-SDF的新型生成式三维建模框架，用于挑战性的文本生成三维形状综合任务。先前的方法在三维数据表示和形状生成方面缺乏灵活性，因此无法生成高度多样化的三维形状以符合给定的文本描述。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一个SDF autoencoder和体素扩散模型，用于学习和生成三维形状的体素化符号距离场（SDF）的表示形式。具体来说，我们设计了一种新颖的UinU-Net结构，在标准的U-Net结构中嵌入一个局部聚焦的内部网络，从而实现对独立于补丁的SDF表示方法更好的重构。我们将我们的方法扩展到进一步的文本生成三维形状任务中，包括文本条件下的形状完成和提高多样性的三维形状生成。",
