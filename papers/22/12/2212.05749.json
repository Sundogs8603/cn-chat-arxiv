    "abstract": "In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of pre-training for visuo-motor control tasks. We revisit a simple Learning-from-Scratch (LfS) baseline that incorporates data augmentation and a shallow ConvNet, and find that this baseline is surprisingly competitive with recent approaches (PVR, MVP, R3M) that leverage frozen visual representations trained on large-scale vision datasets -- across a variety of algorithms, task domains, and metrics in simulation and on a real robot. Our results demonstrate that these methods are hindered by a significant domain gap between the pre-training datasets and current benchmarks for visuo-motor control, which is alleviated by finetuning. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for future research in pre-training for control and hope that our simple yet strong baseline will aid in accurately benchmarking progress in this area.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了预训练在视觉-运动控制任务中的有效性。我们重访了一种简单的从头开始学习（LfS）基线，它包括数据增强和浅层ConvNet，并发现这个基线与利用在大规模视觉数据集上训练的固定视觉表示的最新方法（PVR，MVP，R3M等）在模拟和真实机器人的各种算法、任务领域和指标上具有出人意料的竞争力。我们的结果表明，这些方法受到预训练数据集与当前视觉-运动控制基准之间显著的领域差距的阻碍，这种差距可以通过微调来缓解。基于我们的研究结果，我们提出了未来预训练控制研究方向的建议，并希望我们简单而强大的基线能够帮助准确地评估该领域的进展。",
