    "translated_abstract": "人工智能已经成为解决日常例行任务的常见方法。由于医学影像数据的数量和复杂性呈指数增长，放射科医师的工作量也在稳定增加。我们预计，成像检查数量与专家放射科医师读者数量之间的差距将继续扩大，从而引入需求，即基于人工智能的工具，以提高放射科医师舒适地解读这些检查的效率。人工智能已被证明可提高医学图像生成、处理和解释的效率，并且世界各地的研究实验室开发了各种此类人工智能模型。然而，很少有这些模型进入例行临床应用，这种差距反映了人工智能研究和成功人工智能应用之间的鸿沟。为解决临床应用障碍，我们成立了MONAI联盟，这是一个正在建立的开源社区。",
