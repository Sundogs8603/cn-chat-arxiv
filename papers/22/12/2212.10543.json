    "abstract": "Text detoxification has the potential to mitigate the harms of toxicity by rephrasing text to remove offensive meaning, but subtle toxicity remains challenging to tackle. We introduce MaRCo, a detoxification algorithm that combines controllable generation and text rewriting methods using a Product of Experts with autoencoder language models (LMs). MaRCo uses likelihoods under a non-toxic LM (expert) and a toxic LM (anti-expert) to find candidate words to mask and potentially replace. We evaluate our method on several subtle toxicity and microaggressions datasets, and show that it not only outperforms baselines on automatic metrics, but MaRCo's rewrites are preferred 2.1 $\\times$ more in human evaluation. Its applicability to instances of subtle toxicity is especially promising, demonstrating a path forward for addressing increasingly elusive online hate.",

    "translated_abstract": "文本排毒具有减轻有害性的潜力，可以通过重新表述文本来消除冒犯性的含义，但微妙的有害性仍然很难处理。本文引入MaRCo，一种排毒算法，结合了可控生成和文本重写方法，使用自编码器语言模型（LM）的专家产品和反专家产品。MaRCo使用非有害LM（专家）和有害LM（反专家）下的可能性来查找候选单词以进行掩盖和可能替换。我们在几个微妙有害性和微攻击数据集上评估了我们的方法，并显示它不仅在自动度量上优于基线，而且MaRCo的重写在人类评估中更受欢迎。它对微妙的有害性情况的适用性尤其有前途，为解决日益难以捉摸的在线仇恨问题提供了一条道路。",
