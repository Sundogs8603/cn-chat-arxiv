    "translated_abstract": "本篇论文报告了关于主动推断和贝叶斯大脑组合性解释的一些初步研究。具体而言，我们使用当代应用范畴论的工具为近似推断提供了函子语义。为此，我们在“语法”方面定义了新的贝叶斯透镜的概念，并展示了贝叶斯更新遵循组合透镜模式。利用贝叶斯透镜，并受组合博弈论的启发，我们定义了统计博弈的纤维和将各种统计推断问题分类为对应的部分：相对熵的链式规则被形式化为严格部分，而最大似然估计和自由能则给出了松弛部分。在这个过程中，我们引入了一种新的“复制-组合”的概念。在“语义”方面，我们将一般的开放动力系统（尤其是确定性、随机性和随机性，以及离散和连续时间）作为证明。",
