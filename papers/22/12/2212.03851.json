    "translated_abstract": "本文研究在$\\mathbb{F}^n$中，寻找任意对合代数曲面与给定的线性子空间的交点元素（其中$\\mathbb{F}$可以是实数或复数域）的问题。这个问题涵盖了不同选择的代数曲面下的丰富的算法问题族。特别地，曲面由秩为1的矩阵组成的情况已经与量子信息理论和张量分解等不同领域的核心问题存在紧密联系。即使在秩为1的矩阵族的情况下，该问题已知在最坏情况下是NP-难的。但出乎意料的是，我们开发了一种算法，可以有效地解决“典型”的子空间问题。在这里，子空间$U \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}^n$被选择为特定维数的普通子空间，可能包含一些通用元素。我们的主要发现是，我们的算法可以保证找到所有属于$U$和曲面的交集的元素。",
