    "translated_abstract": "药物靶点相互作用（DTIs）的发现是药物开发中至关重要的过程。计算方法是从众多候选项中预测新型DTIs的有希望和高效的替代方法，避免了繁琐和昂贵的湿实验。最近，由于有了来自不同数据源的丰富异构生物信息，计算方法已经能够利用多个药物和靶标的相似性来提高DTI预测性能。相似性集成是一种有效和灵活的策略，能够提取补充相似性视图中的关键信息，为任何基于相似性的DTI预测模型提供压缩输入。然而，现有的相似性集成方法从全局角度过滤和融合相似性，忽略了每个药物和靶点相似性视图的实用性。在本研究中，我们提出了一种称为FGS的细粒度选择性相似性集成方法，采用一种局部的方法来精细选择性集成相似性。FGS基于各自的邻域结构集成药物和靶点相似性，并允许模型自适应地学习不同相似性视图的权重。在各种基准数据集上的实验结果表明，FGS始终优于现有最先进的相似性集成方法来进行DTI预测。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a Fine-Grained Selective similarity integration approach (FGS) to improve the prediction of drug-target interactions (DTIs), which selectively integrates drug and target similarities in a fine-grained manner based on their respective neighborhood structures, and adaptively learns weights for different similarity views. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that FGS consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art similarity integration methods for DTI prediction."
