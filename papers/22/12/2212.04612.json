    "translated_abstract": "好的模型需要好的训练数据。对于过度参数化的深度模型，训练数据与模型预测之间的因果关系变得越来越不透明和难以理解。通过量化每个训练实例对最终模型的改变程度，影响分析部分揭示了训练的基本相互作用。在最坏情况下，准确测量训练数据的影响力是有可能证明困难的；因此，发展和使用影响力估计器，仅对真实影响进行近似估计。本文首次全面调查了训练数据影响分析与估计。首先，我们系统化各种关于训练数据影响的定义，并在某些方面进行解析。然后，我们将最先进的影响分析方法分类整理；详细描述每种方法，比较其基本假设、渐近复杂度以及整体优缺点。最后，我们提出未来的研究方向。",
