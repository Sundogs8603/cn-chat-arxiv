Hence, provided the first two requisites, it is crucial to evaluate the non-Gaussian identification condition. We address this problem by relating the non-Gaussian dimension of structural errors vector to the rank of a matrix built from the higher-order spectrum of reduced-form errors. This makes our proposal robust to the roots location of the lag polynomials, and generalizes the current procedures designed for the restricted case of a causal structural VAR model. Simulation exercises show that our procedure satisfactorily estimates the number of non-Gaussian components.",

    "translated_abstract": "统计上对可能是非基本 SVARMA 模型的结构性误差进行鲁棒估计需要满足以下条件：（i）是独立同分布的过程，（ii）在各个组件之间相互独立，（iii）每个误差都必须是非高斯分布的。因此，在满足前两个条件的情况下，评估非高斯识别条件是至关重要的。我们通过将结构误差向量的非高斯维度与由约简形式误差的高阶谱构建的矩阵的秩相关联来解决这个问题。这使得我们的方法对于滞后多项式的根位置具有鲁棒性，并且推广了目前针对因果结构 VAR 模型的限制情况设计的程序。仿真实验表明，我们的方法能够令人满意地估计非高斯分量的数量。",
