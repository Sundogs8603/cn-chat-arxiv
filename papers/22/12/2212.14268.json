    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在各种应用中具有卓越的性能。尽管研究人员作出了大量的努力，但是样本的分布情况仍然是深度神经网络分类器的重要局限。在自动驾驶汽车、无人机和机器人等安全关键应用中，将以前未见过的输入识别为新颖是至关重要的。现有的检测方法将深度神经网络视为黑盒，并评估其输出预测的置信度得分。不幸的是，由于深度神经网络没有被训练来减少OOD输入的置信度，因此该方法经常失败。在本研究中，我们介绍了一种新的OOD检测方法。我们的方法受到ReLU-based架构中神经元激活模式（NAP）的理论分析的启发。由于从卷积层提取的激活模式的二进制表示，所以该方法没有引入高计算负担。在多个数据集上进行的广泛实证评估证实了我们的方法优于现有的最先进技术。",
