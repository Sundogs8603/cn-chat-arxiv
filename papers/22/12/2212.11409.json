    "translated_abstract": "最先进的物体检测器由于其高度非线性的内部计算而被视为黑盒子。即使在检测器性能取得了前所未有的进展，由于无法解释其输出是如何生成的，限制了它们在安全关键的应用中的使用。先前的工作未能为边界框和分类决策产生解释，并且通常为各种检测器制作单独的解释。在本文中，我们提出了一个开源的Detector Explanation Toolkit (DExT)，它使用某些基于梯度的解释方法实现了生成所有检测器决策的全面解释。我们提出了各种多对象可视化方法，以合并图像中检测到的多个对象的解释以及单个图像中相应的检测结果。定量评估表明，与其他检测器相比，Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) 更能忠实地解释。",
