    "translated_abstract": "由于传统的联邦学习在异构数据上的表现平庸，个性化联邦学习受到了广泛关注。与传统的联邦学习训练单个全局共识模型不同，个性化联邦学习允许为不同的客户建立不同的模型。然而，现有的个性化联邦学习算法只是通过将知识嵌入到聚合模型或正则化中隐式地传递协作知识。我们观察到这种隐式的知识传递没有充分发挥每个客户的经验风险对其他客户的潜力。基于我们的观察，在这项工作中，我们提出了Personalized Global Federated Learning (PGFed)，这是一个新颖的个性化联邦学习框架，通过显式和自适应地聚合自身和其他客户的经验风险，使每个客户可以个性化其自己的全局目标。",
