    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱推理（KGR）旨在根据知识图谱（KG）中的逻辑规则推断出新的事实，已成为快速增长的研究方向。它已被证明在许多人工智能应用中极大地有益，如问题回答、推荐系统等。根据图类型，现有的KGR模型可以大致分为三类，即静态模型、时态模型和多模态模型。该领域的早期工作主要集中在静态KGR上，而最近的工作尝试利用更实际和更接近现实世界的时态和多模态信息。然而，目前尚无综合总结和讨论这一重要方向中的模型的调查论文和开源存储库。为了填补这个空白，我们进行了一项针对从静态到时态再到多模态KG的知识图谱推理的首次综述。具体而言，本文基于双层分类对模型进行了回顾，",
