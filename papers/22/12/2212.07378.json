    "abstract": "We present 3DHumanGAN, a 3D-aware generative adversarial network that synthesizes photorealistic images of full-body humans with consistent appearances under different view-angles and body-poses. To tackle the representational and computational challenges in synthesizing the articulated structure of human bodies, we propose a novel generator architecture in which a 2D convolutional backbone is modulated by a 3D pose mapping network. The 3D pose mapping network is formulated as a renderable implicit function conditioned on a posed 3D human mesh. This design has several merits: i) it leverages the strength of 2D GANs to produce high-quality images; ii) it generates consistent images under varying view-angles and poses; iii) the model can incorporate the 3D human prior and enable pose conditioning.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了3DHumanGAN，这是一个具有3D感知的生成对抗网络，能够合成具有一致外观的全身人体照片，且能适应不同视角和身体姿势。为了解决合成人体结构时的表达和计算挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的生成器架构，其中2D卷积骨干由一个3D姿态映射网络调制。3D姿态映射网络以有姿态的3D人体网格为条件，形成一个可呈现的隐式函数。这一设计具有以下几个优点：i）它利用了2D GAN的优势来产生高质量的图像；ii）在不同的视角和姿势下生成一致的图像；iii）模型可以结合3D人体先验并实现姿态条件化。",
