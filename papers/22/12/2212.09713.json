    "translated_abstract": "测试时间适应（TTA）是在推理时针对来自不同目标域的测试输入更新预先训练的源模型的问题。目前大多数TTA方法都假设目标域是静态的，即所有测试输入都来自单个目标域。然而，在许多实际应用场景中，测试输入分布可能随着时间的推移而发生终身/持续变化。此外，现有的TTA方法也缺乏提供可靠的不确定性估计的能力，而在源域和目标域之间发生分布变化时，这一点至关重要。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了PETAL（具有自我训练先验知识的概率终身测试时间自适应），它使用概率方法解决了终身TTA问题，自然地得到了（1）学生-教师框架，其中教师模型是学生模型的指数移动平均值，以及（2）使用源模型作为正则化项来推断时正则化模型更新。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a probabilistic framework PETAL for lifelong test-time adaptation, which addresses the issue of continuous distribution shift in test inputs over time and provides reliable uncertainty estimates through regularization with the source model. It also introduces a student-teacher framework where the teacher model is an exponential moving average of the student model."
