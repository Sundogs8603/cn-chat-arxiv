    "translated_abstract": "少样本关系抽取旨在在每个关系中仅有少量标记样本的情况下识别新的关系。之前基于度量的少样本关系抽取算法通过将由少量标记样本嵌入生成的原型与使用训练的度量函数分析查询语句的嵌入进行比较以识别这些关系。然而，由于这些领域始终与训练数据集中的领域存在显着差异，这些方法在许多领域中对未见关系的泛化能力受到限制。因此，我们建议从先验知识和关系的内在语义中学习更易解释和高效的原型，以更有效地在各种领域中提取新的关系。通过使用先前信息探索关系之间的关系，我们有效地改善了关系的原型表示。通过使用对比学习来学习领域不变表示，我们提出了一种新的跨领域小样本关系抽取框架，可以有效地从带有少量标记示例的未见领域中提取新的关系。基准数据集上的实验表明，我们提出的方法在跨领域小样本关系抽取方面优于现有方法。",
