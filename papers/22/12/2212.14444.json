    "abstract": "This paper proposes empirical Bayes shrinkage methods. Compared to common shrinkage methods, we do not assume that the unknown parameters are independent from the known standard errors. This prior independence assumption is both theoretically tenuous and often empirically rejected. We instead model the conditional distribution of the parameter given the standard errors as a location-scale family. This assumption leads to a family of methods that we call CLOSE. We establish that (i) CLOSE is rate-optimal for squared error Bayes regret up to logarithmic factors, (ii) squared error regret control is sufficient for a class of economic decision problems, and (iii) CLOSE is worst-case robust. We illustrate our method with an empirical application to the Opportunity Atlas and Creating Moves to Opportunity (Chetty et al., 2018; Bergman et al., 2019). For the decision problem of selecting high mobility Census tracts in Bergman et al. (2019), CLOSE selects Census tracts that are more economicall",

    "tldr": "本文提出一种名为CLOSE的经验贝叶斯方法，不需假设未知参数独立于已知标准误差，选择标准误差给定条件下的条件分布建模为位置-尺度族。对于平方误差贝叶斯后悔率，CLOSE具有最优速率，CLOSE是最坏情况下强健的。在经验应用中表现良好。"
