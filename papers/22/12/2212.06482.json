    "translated_abstract": "无蜂窝大规模MIMO作为一种有前景的未来无线通信技术，预计将与传统蜂窝系统相比，提供均匀覆盖和高频谱效率。本文研究了无蜂窝大规模MIMO如何支持联邦边缘学习。利用无线多址信道的可加性特性，通过空中计算的方式，客户端同时将他们的本地更新发送到相同的通信资源上。这种方法被称为空中联邦学习（OTA-FL），已经证明可以减轻在无线网络上进行联邦学习的通信开销。考虑到信道相关性和中央服务器上仅有的不完全信道状态信息，我们提出了一种在无蜂窝大规模MIMO上实现OTA-FL的实际方法。我们通过理论分析和实验研究了该实现的收敛性，验证了无蜂窝大规模MIMO的优势。",
