    "abstract": "Emerging real-time multi-model ML (RTMM) workloads such as AR/VR and drone control involve dynamic behaviors in various granularity; task, model, and layers within a model. Such dynamic behaviors introduce new challenges to the system software in an ML system since the overall system load is not completely predictable, unlike traditional ML workloads. In addition, RTMM workloads require real-time processing, involve highly heterogeneous models, and target resource-constrained devices. Under such circumstances, developing an effective scheduler gains more importance to better utilize underlying hardware considering the unique characteristics of RTMM workloads. Therefore, we propose a new scheduler, DREAM, which effectively handles various dynamicity in RTMM workloads targeting multi-accelerator systems. DREAM quantifies the unique requirements for RTMM workloads and utilizes the quantified scores to drive scheduling decisions, considering the current system load and other inference jobs",

    "translated_abstract": "新兴的实时多模型机器学习（RTMM）工作负载，如AR/VR和无人机控制，涉及到不同粒度的动态行为；任务、模型以及模型内的层次。这些动态行为给ML系统中的系统软件带来了新的挑战，因为整体系统负载不完全可预测，不像传统的机器学习工作负载。此外，RTMM工作负载需要实时处理，涉及到高度异构的模型，并且目标是资源受限的设备。在这种情况下，开发一种有效的调度器对于更好地利用底层硬件来说更加重要，考虑到RTMM工作负载的独特特性。因此，我们提出了一种新的调度器，名为DREAM，它能够有效处理RTMM工作负载中的各种动态性，针对多加速器系统进行调度。DREAM量化了RTMM工作负载的独特需求，并利用这些量化得分来驱动调度决策，考虑当前系统负载和其他推理任务。",
