However, collecting large-scale robotic data is much more expensive and slower as each operator can control only a single robot at a time. To make this costly data collection process efficient and scalable, we propose Policy Assisted TeleOperation (PATO), a system which automates part of the demonstration collection process using a learned assistive policy. PATO autonomously executes repetitive behaviors in data collection and asks for human input only when it is uncertain about which subtask or behavior to execute. We conduct teleoperation user studies both with a real robot and a simulated robot fleet and demonstrate that our assisted teleoperation system reduces human operators' mental load while improving data collection efficiency. Further, it enables a single operator to control multiple robots in parallel, which is a first",

    "translated_abstract": "大规模数据是机器学习的重要组成部分，正如在自然语言处理和计算机视觉研究的最新进展中所证明的那样。但是，采集大规模机器人数据的成本更高，速度更慢，因为每个操作员只能同时控制一个机器人。为了使这个昂贵的数据采集过程高效和可伸缩，我们提出了策略辅助的远程操作系统（PATO），该系统利用学习到的辅助策略自动执行部分演示采集过程。PATO在数据采集中自动执行重复的行为，并仅在不确定要执行哪个子任务或行为时请求人类输入。我们进行了与真实机器人和模拟机器人群体的远程操作用户研究，并证明我们的辅助远程操作系统能够减少人工操作员的心理负担，同时提高数据采集效率。此外，它使单个操作员能够并行控制多个机器人，这是首次。",
