    "abstract": "We present NusaCrowd, a collaborative initiative to collect and unify existing resources for Indonesian languages, including opening access to previously non-public resources. Through this initiative, we have brought together 137 datasets and 118 standardized data loaders. The quality of the datasets has been assessed manually and automatically, and their value is demonstrated through multiple experiments. NusaCrowd's data collection enables the creation of the first zero-shot benchmarks for natural language understanding and generation in Indonesian and the local languages of Indonesia. Furthermore, NusaCrowd brings the creation of the first multilingual automatic speech recognition benchmark in Indonesian and the local languages of Indonesia. Our work strives to advance natural language processing (NLP) research for languages that are under-represented despite being widely spoken.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了NusaCrowd，这是一个协作倡议，旨在收集和统一印尼语言的现有资源，包括开放以前非公开的资源。通过该倡议，我们汇集了137个数据集和118个标准化数据加载程序。数据集的质量已经经过手动和自动评估，它们的价值通过多个实验得到了证明。NusaCrowd的数据收集使得可以创建印尼语和印度尼西亚本地语言的零样本自然语言理解和生成基准，进一步推动了印尼语和印度尼西亚本地语言的多语言自动语音识别基准的创建。我们的工作致力于推进对在使用广泛的语言的自然语言处理（NLP）研究的发展，从而使之受到更多关注。",
