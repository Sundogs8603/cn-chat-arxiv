    "abstract": "As information extraction (IE) systems have grown more adept at processing whole documents, the classic task of template filling has seen renewed interest as benchmark for document-level IE. In this position paper, we call into question the suitability of template filling for this purpose. We argue that the task demands definitive answers to thorny questions of event individuation -- the problem of distinguishing distinct events -- about which even human experts disagree. Through an annotation study and error analysis, we show that this raises concerns about the usefulness of template filling metrics, the quality of datasets for the task, and the ability of models to learn it. Finally, we consider possible solutions.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着信息提取系统在处理整个文件方面越来越熟练，传统的模板填充任务作为文件级信息提取的基准任务再次引起了人们的关注。在本文中，我们质疑了模板填充任务在这方面的适用性。我们认为该任务要求对事件个体化问题提供明确的答案——即区分不同的事件——而即使是人类专家在这个问题上也存在分歧。通过注释研究和误差分析，我们展示了这引发了对模板填充度量的有效性、任务数据集的质量以及模型学习能力的担忧。最后，我们考虑了可能的解决方案。",
