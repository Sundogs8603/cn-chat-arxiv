    "translated_abstract": "近年来，自动音乐转录（AMT）的任务受到了越来越多的关注，其中包括从音频中估计各种音符属性。同时，多音高估计（MPE）相关任务仍然是几乎所有AMT方法的具有挑战性但必要的组成部分，即使只是隐含地。在AMT上下文中，音高信息通常被量化为西方音乐音阶的名义音高。即使在更一般的情况下，MPE系统通常也会产生具有某种量化程度的音高预测。在GT转录等某些AMT应用中，估计连续值音高轮廓更有意义。吉他谱有能力表示各种演奏技巧，其中一些涉及音高调制。目前的AMT方法没有充分解决音高调制问题，并且只提供更少的量化方法以换取更多的模型复杂性。本文介绍了一种名为FretNet的新方法，它可以实现连续值音高轮廓流，并估计在各个时间点上的音高、延音和滑音等吉他技巧。我们在多个数据集上评估了FretNet，结果表明，它比当前最先进的方法提供更高的平均精度和更少的模型复杂度。在各种GT任务中，包括转换民谣吉他、流行吉他和电台吉他等吉他类型，FretNet都表现出色，这表明了FretNet在真实世界应用中的潜力。",
