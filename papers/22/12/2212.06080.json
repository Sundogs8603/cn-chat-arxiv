    "translated_abstract": "经济学家经常为零点良好定义但在$y$很大时表现出$log(y)$的转化结果估计平均处理效应（ATE）（例如$log(1+y)$、$arcsinh(y)$）。我们表明，这些ATE对结果的单位具有任意依赖性，因此不应解释为百分比效应。与此结果一致，我们发现，当将结果的单位乘以100（例如将美元转换为美分）时，美国经济评论中发表的$arcsinh$转化后的结果的估计处理效应会发生相当大的变化。为了帮助界定替代方法，我们证明，当结果可能等于零时，不存在形式为$E_P[g(Y(1),Y(0))]$的平均处理效应是点识别且单位不变的。我们最后讨论了具有零价值结果的设置的明智的替代目标参数，放宽了这些要求中的至少一个要求。",
    "tldr": "经济学家经常估计以结果的对数变换为基础的平均处理效应，但是这些效应取决于结果的单位，因此不应解释为百分比效应，并且对结果的比例变换会导致结果的变化；当结果可能为零时，则不存在点识别且单位不变的平均处理效应，需要考虑替代目标参数。",
    "en_tdlr": "Economists often estimate average treatment effects based on logarithmically transformed outcomes, but these effects depend on the units of the outcome and should not be interpreted as percentage effects. The effects also change when the units of the outcome are multiplied by a constant factor. When the outcome can equal zero, there is no unit-invariant and point-identified average treatment effect, and alternative target parameters should be considered."
