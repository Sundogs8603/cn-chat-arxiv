    "translated_abstract": "由于相量测量装置（PMUs）通常放置在最高电压的母线上，因此许多低电压级别的大规模电力系统无法被其观测到。这种观测缺失使得同步时间状态估计成为一个具有挑战性的问题。我们提出了一种基于深度神经网络的状态估计器（DeNSE），以解决这个问题。该DeNSE采用贝叶斯框架，通过间接结合来自慢时间尺度但普遍存在的监督控制与数据采集（SCADA）数据与快时间尺度但局部的PMU数据的推断，实现对整个系统的亚秒级情景感知。通过考虑拓扑变化、非高斯测量噪声和错误数据检测和校正，展示了所提方法的实际效用。使用IEEE 118-bus系统得到的结果表明了DeNSE在纯SCADA状态估计器、SCADA-PMU混合状态估计器和仅PMU线性状态估计器方面的优越性。",
