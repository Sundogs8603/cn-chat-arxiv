    "title": "Respecting priorities versus respecting preferences in school choice: When is there a trade-off?. (arXiv:2212.02881v2 [econ.TH] UPDATED)",
    "abstract": "A classic trade-off that school districts face when deciding which matching algorithm to use is that it is not possible to always respect both priorities and preferences. The student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm (DA) respects priorities but can lead to inefficient allocations. We identify a new condition on school choice markets under which DA is efficient. Our condition generalizes earlier conditions by placing restrictions on how preferences and priorities relate to one another only on the parts that are relevant for the assignment. Whenever there is a unique allocation that respects priorities, our condition captures all the environments for which DA is efficient. We show through stylized examples and simulations that our condition significantly expands the range of known environments for which DA is efficient. We also discuss how our condition sheds light on existing empirical findings.",

    "translated_abstract": "学区在决定使用哪种匹配算法时，面临的一个经典权衡是无法同时尊重优先级和偏好。学生提议的延迟接受算法（DA）尊重优先级，但可能导致效率低下的分配。我们提出了一种关于学校选择市场的新条件，在这种条件下，DA是高效的。我们的条件通过对偏好和优先级在影响分配的相关部分上的关系加以限制来推广了先前的条件。只要有一种唯一的分配符合优先级，我们的条件就能涵盖所有环境中DA是高效的。通过样例和模拟，我们展示了我们的条件如何显著扩大DA高效性的已知范围。我们还讨论了我们的条件如何解释现有的实证研究结果。",
