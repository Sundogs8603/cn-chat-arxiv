    "translated_abstract": "在生物研究中，荧光染色是揭示亚细胞结构位置和形态的关键技术。然而，这种技术速度慢、费用高且对细胞有害。本文将其建模为一个深度学习任务——亚细胞结构预测（SSP），旨在预测多个亚细胞结构的三维荧光图像，从而从3D透射光图像中获取更多信息。由于当前生物技术的局限性，每个图像在SSP中只有部分标注。此外，亚细胞结构的大小差异很大，这导致了SSP的多尺度问题。为了克服这些挑战，本文提出了重新参数化多元专家混合（RepMode），一种网络，它利用任务感知的先验动态组织其参数以处理指定的单标签预测任务。在RepMode中，多元专家混合（MoDE）块被设计为学习所有任务的广义参数，同时门控重新参数化（GatRep）被用来对其进行微调以适应特定任务。",
