    "translated_abstract": "在许多领域如社交网络分析中，基于在线帖子来预测人格特征已成为一项重要任务。这个任务的挑战之一是从各种帖子中汇总信息，形成每个用户的整体资料。许多先前的解决方案将帖子简单地连接成长文档，然后通过顺序或分层模型对文档进行编码，这种方式引入了无序的帖子，可能会误导模型。本文提出了一种动态深度图卷积网络(D-DGCN)，以克服上述限制。具体地，我们设计了一种学习连接方法，采用动态多跳结构而非确定性结构，并将其与DGCN模块相结合，自动学习帖子之间的连接。帖子编码器、学习连接和DGCN模块同时进行端到端的联合训练。在Kaggle和Pandora数据集上的实验结果显示出D-DGCN的优越性能。",
