    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的多元多步骤交通预测模型通常在序列到序列的设置中使用均方误差（MSE）或平均绝对误差（MAE）作为损失函数，简单地假设误差遵循独立且各向同性的高斯或拉普拉斯分布。然而，在现实世界的交通预测任务中，这样的假设往往是不切实际的，因为时空预测的概率分布非常复杂，并且在时间上存在强烈的同时相关性，涉及传感器和预测时间跨度。在本文中，我们将矩阵变量误差过程的时变分布建模为零均值高斯分布的动态混合模型。为了实现高效性、灵活性和可扩展性，我们使用矩阵正态分布参数化每个混合成分，并允许混合权重随时间变化和可预测。所提出的方法可以无缝集成",
