Inspired by wavelets, we learn a neural field that decompose the signal both spatially and frequency-wise. We follow the recent grid-based paradigm for spatial decomposition, but unlike existing work, encourage specific frequencies to be stored in each grid via Fourier features encodings. We then apply a multi-layer perceptron with sine activations, taking these Fourier encoded features in at appropriate layers so that higher-frequency components are accumulated on top of lower-frequency components sequentially, which we sum up to form the final output. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the art regarding model compactness and convergence speed on multiple tasks: 2D image fitting, 3D shape reconstruction, and neural radiance fields.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的方法，以提供高效且高度详细的重构。受小波启发，我们学习了一个神经场，既在空间上又在频率上分解信号。我们遵循最近的基于网格的空间分解范例，但与现有的工作不同，通过傅里叶特征编码鼓励在每个网格中存储特定的频率。然后，我们应用带正弦激活函数的多层感知器，以在适当的层次上接受这些傅里叶编码的特征，以使高频组件依次累积在低频组件之上，最后将它们相加以形成最终输出。我们证明了我们的方法在多个任务上（2D图像拟合，3D形状重建和神经辐射场）优于现有技术，包括模型紧凑性和收敛速度。我们的代码可以在https://github.com/ubc-vision/NFFB获得。",
