Such variables are not observed by the researcher but are nonparametrically identified and estimable. Applications of the test include models with endogenous regressors identified by control functions, semiparametric sample selection models, or binary games with incomplete information. The statistic is built from the residuals of the semiparametric model. A novel wild bootstrap procedure is shown to provide valid critical values. We consider nonparametric estimators with an automatic bias correction that makes the test implementable without undersmoothing. In simulations the test exhibits good small sample performances, and an application to women's labor force participation decisions shows its implementation in a real data context.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对具有非参数生成回归变量的半参数模型提出了一种规格检验方法。这些变量由研究者无法观测到，但可以进行非参数识别和估计。该检验的应用包括通过控制函数识别内生回归变量的模型、半参数样本选择模型或具有不完全信息的二元博弈模型。该统计量建立在半参数模型的残差基础上。新颖的自举程序被证明可以提供有效的临界值。我们考虑了具有自动偏差修正的非参数估计方法，使得该检验在没有低估平滑的情况下可以实施。通过模拟实验证明，该检验在小样本情况下表现良好，而对女性劳动力参与决策的应用则展示了其在实际数据环境中的实现。",
