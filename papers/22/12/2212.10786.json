    "abstract": "Relation Extraction (RE) has been extended to cross-document scenarios because many relations are not simply described in a single document. This inevitably brings the challenge of efficient open-space evidence retrieval to support the inference of cross-document relations, along with the challenge of multi-hop reasoning on top of entities and evidence scattered in an open set of documents. To combat these challenges, we propose MR.COD (Multi-hop evidence retrieval for Cross-document relation extraction), which is a multi-hop evidence retrieval method based on evidence path mining and ranking. We explore multiple variants of retrievers to show evidence retrieval is essential in cross-document RE. We also propose a contextual dense retriever for this setting. Experiments on CodRED show that evidence retrieval with MR.COD effectively acquires crossdocument evidence and boosts end-to-end RE performance in both closed and open settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "关系抽取(RE)已经扩展到跨文档场景中，因为许多关系不仅仅在一个文档中描述。这不可避免地带来了有效的开放空间证据检索的挑战，以支持跨文档关系的推断，同时也带来了多跳推理的挑战，以处理散布在开放式文档集中的实体和证据。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了MR.COD(跨文档关系抽取的多跳证据检索)，这是一种基于证据路径挖掘和排序的多跳证据检索方法。我们探索了多个检索器的变体，以显示证据检索在跨文档RE中的重要性。我们还为此设置提出了一种上下文密集的检索器。在CodRED上的实验表明，MR.COD的证据检索有效地获取了跨文档证据，并提升了封闭和开放设置中的端到端RE性能。",
