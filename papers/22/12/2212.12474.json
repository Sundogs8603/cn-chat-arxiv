    "translated_abstract": "线性偏微分方程是一类重要且广泛应用的机械模型，描述了物理过程，例如热传导、电磁学和波传播等。实践中，通常使用基于离散化的专门数值方法来解决偏微分方程。这些求解器通常使用未知模型参数的估计值以及如果可用的话，物理测量值用于初始化。这些求解器经常嵌入到具有下游应用的更大的科学模型中，因此误差量化起着关键作用。然而，经典的偏微分方程求解器忽略参数和测量不确定性，可能无法产生一致性的估计值，以用于计算其固有的逼近误差。本文通过将求解线性偏微分方程解释为物理学知识指导的高斯过程回归来解决这个问题。我们的框架基于高斯过程推理定理的一个关键推广，该定理适用于通过任意界面进行观察的情况。",
