    "translated_abstract": "量子机器学习已成为一个引起越来越多关注的领域，但它存在一定的理论和硬件限制。特别是，消失梯度问题或称为贫瘠高原问题，使得对于拥有大量量子比特的电路，训练变得不可能，限制了数据科学家在解决问题时可以使用的量子比特数量。另外，独立的角度嵌入监督量子神经网络被证明能够产生具有与编码深度和编码应用于的并行比特数直接相关的截断傅里叶级数。傅里叶级数的次数限制了模型的表达能力。本工作引入了两种新的体系结构，其傅里叶级数的次数呈指数增长：顺序和并行的指数增长量子机器学习体系结构。通过在编码时高效地利用可用的希尔伯特空间，增加了量子编码的表达能力，从而实现了指数增长。",
