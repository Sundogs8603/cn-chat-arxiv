    "abstract": "When information acquisition is costly but flexible, a principal may rationally acquire information that favors ``majorities'' over ``minorities'' unless the latter are strictly more productive than the former. Majorities therefore face incentives to invest in becoming productive, whereas minorities are discouraged from such investments. The principal, in turn, focuses scarce attentional resources on majorities precisely because they are likely to invest. We give conditions under which the resulting discriminatory equilibrium is most preferred by the principal, despite that all groups are ex-ante identical. Our results add to the discussions of affirmative action, implicit bias, and occupational segregation and stereotypes.",

    "translated_abstract": "当信息获取成本高但灵活时，委托人可能会合理地获取有利于“多数族群”而不利于“少数族群”的信息，除非后者严格比前者更具生产力。因此，多数族群面临投资成为生产力的动力，而少数族群则被阻碍了这样的投资。与此同时，委托人将有限的注意资源集中在多数族群上，因为他们很可能进行投资。我们给出了在所有群体在事前是相同的情况下，导致歧视性平衡最受委托人青睐的条件。我们的结果增加了对平权行动、隐性偏见、职业性别隔离和刻板印象的讨论。",
    "tldr": "合理忽视的统计歧视模型研究了信息获取成本对委托人对待多数族群和少数族群不平等的影响，发现多数族群面临投资动力而少数族群被阻碍投资。结果对平权行动、隐性偏见、职业性别隔离和刻板印象的讨论具有重要意义。",
    "en_tdlr": "The paper studies the impact of information acquisition costs on the unequal treatment of majority and minority groups in a rationally inattentive statistical discrimination model, finding that the majority faces incentives to invest while the minority is discouraged from investing. The results are significant for discussions on affirmative action, implicit bias, occupational segregation, and stereotypes."
