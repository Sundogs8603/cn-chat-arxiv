    "translated_abstract": "自主车辆适用于连续区域巡逻问题。然而，由于众多原因，寻找最优巡逻策略可能具有挑战性。首先，巡逻环境通常较为复杂，可能会包含诸如风或景观等未知环境因素。其次，自主车辆可能会出现故障或硬件限制，例如电池寿命有限。重要的是，巡逻大区域通常需要多个智能体协同执行任务。在本文中，我们考虑了这些限制，并提出了一种基于无模型、深度多智能体强化学习的方法。在该方法中，智能体被训练在具有各种未知动态和因素的环境中进行巡逻。它们可以自动充电以支持连续集体巡逻。我们提出了一种分布式的同构多智能体架构，其中所有巡逻智能体基于其本地观察和共享通信在本地执行相同的策略。此外，所提出的方法考虑了能量消耗和容错等因素，以确保系统连续自适应地运行。",
