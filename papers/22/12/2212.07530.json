    "translated_abstract": "多语言机器翻译模型可以从不同语言对之间的协同中获益，但同时也会受到干扰的影响。虽然目前有越来越多的先进方法旨在消除干扰，但我们对干扰现象的理解仍然有限。本研究确定了导致多语言机器翻译中干扰的主要因素。通过系统化试验，我们发现干扰（或协同）主要由模型大小、数据大小和每个语言对在总数据集中所占比例来决定。我们观察到，当模型相对于可用的训练数据非常小的时候，会出现严重的干扰，而使用不到10亿参数的标准Transformer配置可以在很大程度上缓解干扰并促进协同。此外，我们还展示了通过调整采样温度以控制数据中每个语言对所占比例的方法是平衡语言对之间关系的关键。",
