    "abstract": "In a binary-treatment instrumental variable framework, we define supercompliers as the subpopulation whose treatment take-up positively responds to eligibility and whose outcome positively responds to take-up. Supercompliers are the only subpopulation to benefit from treatment eligibility and, hence, are of great policy interest. Given a set of jointly testable assumptions and a binary outcome, we can completely identify the characteristics of supercompliers. Specifically, we require the standard assumptions from the local average treatment effect literature along with an outcome monotonicity assumption (i.e., treatment is weakly beneficial). We can estimate and conduct inference on supercomplier characteristics using standard instrumental variable regression.",
