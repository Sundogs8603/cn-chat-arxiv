    "abstract": "We study optimal bundling when consumers differ in one dimension. We introduce a partial order on the set of bundles defined by (i) set inclusion and (ii) sales volumes (if sold alone and priced optimally). We show that if the undominated bundles with respect to this partial order are nested, then nested bundling (tiered pricing) is optimal. We characterize which nested menu is optimal: Selling a given menu of nested bundles is optimal if a smaller bundle in (out of) the menu sells more (less) than a bigger bundle in the menu. We present three applications of these insights: the first two connect optimal bundling and quality design to price elasticities and cost structures; the last one establishes a necessary and sufficient condition for costly screening to be optimal when a principal can use both price and nonprice screening instruments.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了消费者在一个维度上的差异时的最优捆绑。我们引入了捆绑集合的偏序关系，其中包括(i) 集合包含关系和(ii) 单独销售时的销售量（定价最优）。我们证明，如果在这个偏序关系下没有优于其他捆绑集合，那么分层定价是最优的。我们刻画了哪种分层菜单是最优的:如果菜单中较小的捆绑比菜单中较大的捆绑销售更多（更少），则出售特定菜单的嵌套捆绑是最优的。我们提出了三个应用例子:前两个将最优捆绑和质量设计与价格弹性和成本结构联系起来; 最后一个建立了一个必要和充分条件，表明在主体可以使用价格和非价格筛选工具时，昂贵的筛选是最优的。",

The authors prove that tiered pricing is optimal and propose an optimal scheme of nested bundles. Additionally, three applications connecting optimal bundling and quality design to price elasticities and cost structures are presented, and a necessary and sufficient condition for costly screening to be optimal is established when a principal can use both price and non-price screening instruments."
