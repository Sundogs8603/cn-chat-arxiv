    "translated_abstract": "解决现实世界中的最优控制问题是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为复杂的高维系统动力学通常对决策者来说是未知的。因此，通过数值方法找到最优控制动作是困难的。为了应对这种建模和计算挑战，在本文中，我们将神经网络与庞特里亚金最大原理（PMP）相结合，提出了一种样本高效的框架NN-PMP-Gradient。所得到的控制器可以用于具有未知和复杂动力学的系统。通过采用迭代方法，所提出的框架不仅利用了由神经网络参数化的准确替代模型，还通过PMP条件高效地恢复了最优性条件以及最优动作序列。在线性二次调节器、与网格连接的有损电池的能源套利、单摆的控制和两个MuJoCo运动任务的数值仿真中，证明了我们提出的NN-PMP-Gradient是一个通用的和多功能的框架。",
