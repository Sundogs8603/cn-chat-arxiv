    "translated_abstract": "从多回波$T_2$加权MRI（$T_2W$）数据估计$T_2$弛豫时间分布可以为评估不同病理情况下的炎症、脱髓鞘、水肿和软骨组成提供有价值的生物标志物，包括神经退行性疾病，骨关节炎和肿瘤。已经提出了基于深度神经网络（DNN）的方法来解决从MRI数据估计$T_2$分布的复杂逆问题，但它们对低信噪比（SNR）的临床数据不够鲁棒，并且非常敏感于在采集过程中使用的回波时间（TE）的变化，因此它们在临床实践和具有异构采集协议的大规模多机构试验中的应用受到阻碍。我们提出了一种称为$P_2T_2$的物理引导的DNN方法，它将信号衰减正向模型与MRI信号合并到DNN结构中，以提高准确性和稳健性。",
