    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了用于两个经典策略证明匹配机制（DA和TTC）的各种新的复杂度度量标准。 我们的度量标准旨在捕捉各种结构（而非计算）方面的复杂性，特别是近期在经济领域越发重要的方面。我们考虑了一个经典而灵活的方法来规范我们的问题：定义一个执行某个任务的协议或数据结构，并限制它所需的位数。我们的结果将这种方法应用于四个普遍关心的问题。对于将申请人与机构进行匹配，我们问：（1）一个申请人如何影响匹配结果？（2）一个申请人如何影响另一个申请人的选择集？（3）匹配结果如何表示/通信？ （4）如何验证匹配结果？我们证明，在问题（1）和（4）下，DA和TTC的复杂度是可比较的，提供了新的严格届。",
