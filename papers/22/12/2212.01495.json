    "abstract": "Motivation: Enhancers are important cis-regulatory elements that regulate a wide range of biological functions and enhance the transcription of target genes. Although many feature extraction methods have been proposed to improve the performance of enhancer identification, they cannot learn position-related multiscale contextual information from raw DNA sequences.  Results: In this article, we propose a novel enhancer identification method (iEnhancer-ELM) based on BERT-like enhancer language models. iEnhancer-ELM tokenizes DNA sequences with multi-scale k-mers and extracts contextual information of different scale k-mers related with their positions via an multi-head attention mechanism. We first evaluate the performance of different scale k-mers, then ensemble them to improve the performance of enhancer identification. The experimental results on two popular benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms stateof-the-art methods. We further illustrate the interpretability of iEnhanc",

    "translated_abstract": "动机：增强子是重要的顺式调控元件，可以调控各种生物功能并增强目标基因的转录。尽管已经提出了许多特征提取方法来改善增强子鉴定的性能，但它们不能从原始DNA序列中学习位置相关的多尺度上下文信息。结果：本文提出了一种基于BERT-like增强子语言模型的新型增强子鉴定方法（iEnhancer-ELM）。iEnhancer-ELM使用多尺度k-mers对DNA序列进行标记化，并通过多头注意机制提取与位置相关的不同尺度k-mers的上下文信息。首先评估不同尺度k-mers的性能，然后将它们集成以提高增强子鉴定的性能。对两个流行的基准数据集进行的实验结果表明，我们的模型优于目前最先进的方法。我们进一步说明了iEnhancer的可解释性。",
