    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于有监督学习和信道状态信息（CSI）的室内人体存在检测引起了广泛的关注。然而，现有的研究依赖于CSI的空间信息，容易受到环境变化的影响，如物体移动、大气因素和机器重启，从而降低了预测精度。此外，基于有监督学习的方法需要进行耗时的标注来重新训练模型。因此，使用半监督学习方案设计一个连续监控的模型生命周期是必要的。在本文中，我们构思了一种双折叠师生（BTS）学习方法来检测存在于系统中的存在。该方法结合了半监督学习，利用部分标记和未标记的数据集。所提出的原始对偶师生网络从标记和未标记的CSI中智能地学习空间和时间特征。此外，增强的惩罚损失函数利用熵和距离测量来区分深层特征，降低噪声的影响。",
