    "translated_title": "稳定的美术家：扭曲漫流空间中的语义驾驭",
    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于大规模的文本条件下的生成扩散模型因其惊人的性能而受到了广泛关注，可以仅通过文本生成高保真度的图像。然而，一次性获得高质量的结果几乎是不可行的。相反，文本指导的图像生成包括用户对输入进行多次微小的更改，以迭代地雕刻出所想象的图像。然而，输入提示的微小更改通常会导致生成完全不同的图像，因此艺术家的控制受限于其粒度。为了提供灵活性，我们提出了稳定的美术家，这是一种图像编辑方法，可使图像生成过程中的细粒度控制更加容易。主要组成部分是语义引导(SEGA)，它沿着不同数量的语义方向引导扩散过程。这允许对图像进行微妙的编辑、改变构图和风格，以及优化整体艺术构思。此外，我们提出了一种名为潜在遍历的新技术，它可以实现对图像特定区域的局部和有导向地修改。我们的方法在各种文本到图像合成任务中实现了最先进的定量和定性结果，为用户提供了对所生成的图像前所未有的控制。",
