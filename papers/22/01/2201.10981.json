    "translated_title": "MRI中肝脏和肝部损伤联合分割的混合CNN与Transformer层",
    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的肝脏和其中肝部损伤的分割在临床实践中越来越受到重视，因为每年肝癌的发病率不断增加。虽然过去几年中已经成功开发了具有总体有希望结果的各种网络变体在医学图像分割领域，但几乎所有这些网络都难以精准地分割MRI中的肝部损伤。这导致了将卷积和基于Transformer的结构元素相结合的想法，以克服现有限制。本文提出了一种混合网络SWTR-Unet，它由预训练的ResNet、Transformer块以及常见的Unet-style解码器路径组成。该网络主要应用于单模态非增强肝脏MRI，并额外应用于公开可用的CT数据，以验证其在其他模态数据上的适用性。结果表明，所提出的SWTR-Unet相对于最新的方法具有更好的性能，并在训练时间方面高效。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种名为SWTR-Unet的混合网络，它通过将卷积和基于Transformer的结构元素相结合，实现了MRI中肝脏和肝部损伤联合分割的高效、精确和可靠。该网络在单模态和多模态数据上都具有超过最新方法的表现。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a hybrid network called SWTR-Unet, which overcomes the existing limitations of accurately segmenting hepatic lesions in MRI through combining elements of convolutional and transformer-based architectures. The network achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods and is efficient in terms of training time in both single and multi-modal data."
