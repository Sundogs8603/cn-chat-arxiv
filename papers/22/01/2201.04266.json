    "translated_abstract": "标准的博弈论解决概念纳什均衡假设所有玩家都会理性行为。如果我们按照纳什均衡进行决策而对手却是非理性的（或者按照另外一个纳什均衡的策略行动），那么我们可能会得到非常低的回报。另一方面，最大最小策略假设所有对手都在试图最小化我们的回报（即使这并不符合他们最佳利益），并确保了最差情况下的最大可能回报，但结果是过于保守的行动。我们提出了一个新的解决概念，称为安全均衡，它将对手建模为以指定的概率进行理性行为，而用剩余的概率进行任意行为。我们证明了在所有形式的战略博弈中都存在安全均衡（对于所有可能的理性参数值），并证明了其计算是PPAD-hard的。我们提供了在2人和n人博弈中计算安全均衡的精确算法，以及可扩展性算法。",
