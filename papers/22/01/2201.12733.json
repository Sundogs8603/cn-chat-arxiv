    "translated_abstract": "神经网络架构的点云模型在安全关键的应用中取得了巨大成功，如自动驾驶车辆中基于激光雷达的识别系统。然而，这些模型容易受到对抗性攻击，旨在施加旋转和锥形等隐秘的语义变换来误导模型预测。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于转换特定平滑的框架TPC，为点云模型提供紧密且可扩展的防御保证，抵御语义转换攻击。我们首先将常见的3D转换分为三类：可叠加的（例如剪切）、可组合的（例如旋转）和间接可组合的（如锥形），然后分别提供了通用的鲁棒性认证策略。接着，我们针对一系列特定的语义转换和它们的组合，指定了唯一的认证协议。在几个常见的物体识别数据集上进行了大量实验证明，TPC可以在提供更强的防御能力的同时，降低点云模型性能损失。",

It provides generic robustness certification strategies for common 3D transformations, as well as unique certification protocols for a range of specific semantic transformations and their compositions. Extensive experiments on several common datasets demonstrate that TPC can provide stronger defense capabilities while reducing the performance loss of point cloud models."
