Recently, learning-based graph generation that reproduces real-world graphs has been attracting the attention of many researchers.

In this paper, we propose a generative model that allows us to tune the value of a global-level structural feature as a condition. Our model, called GraphTune, makes it possible to tune the value of any structural feature of generated graphs using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder (CVAE). We performed comparative evaluations of GraphTune and conventional models on a real graph dataset. The evaluations show that GraphTune makes it possible to more clearly tune the value of a global-level structural feature better than conventional",

    "translated_abstract": "自从几十年前开始研究生成图的方法以来，这一领域已经得到了广泛的应用。最近，越来越多的研究者开始关注能够重现实际图的生成模型。虽然已经提出了几种利用现代机器学习技术的生成模型，但是在条件生成通用图形方面还有很多探索空间。本文提出了一种生成模型GraphTune，它允许我们将全局结构特征的值作为条件进行调整。GraphTune利用长短时记忆（LSTM）和条件变分自编码器（CVAE）使得可以调整生成图中的任何结构特征的值。使用真实图形数据集对GraphTune和传统模型进行比较评估，结果表明GraphTune可以更清晰地调整生成图的全局结构特征的值，效果优于传统模型。",
