    "translated_abstract": "量子机器学习是一个快速发展的领域，旨在利用量子算法和量子计算解决机器学习问题。由于物理量子比特缺乏和缺乏有效的将现实世界数据从欧几里得空间映射到希尔伯特空间的方法，大多数方法都是基于量子类比或过程模拟，而不是基于量子比特的具体体系结构设计。在本文中，我们提出了一种新型的混合量子-经典算法，用于处理基于图的数据，我们将其称为基于自我图的量子图神经网络（egoQGNN）。egoQGNN使用张量积和单位矩阵表示实现了GNN理论框架，大大减少了所需的模型参数数量。当被经典计算机控制时，egoQGNN可以通过从输入图的自我图中处理来容纳任意大小的图，使用一个中等大小的量子设备。该体系结构基于从现实世界数据到希尔伯特空间的新型映射方式。",
