    "abstract": "We propose two specifications of a real-time mixed-frequency semi-structural time series model for evaluating the output potential, output gap, Phillips curve, and Okun's law for the US. The baseline model uses minimal theory-based multivariate identification restrictions to inform trend-cycle decomposition, while the alternative model adds the CBO's output gap measure as an observed variable. The latter model results in a smoother output potential and lower cyclical correlation between inflation and real variables but performs worse in forecasting beyond the short term. This methodology allows for the assessment and real-time monitoring of official trend and gap estimates.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了两种实时混合频率半结构化时间序列模型的规范，用于评估美国的产出潜力、产出缺口、菲利普斯曲线和奥肯定律。基准模型使用最少的基于理论的多元识别限制来指导趋势周期分解，而替代模型将国会预算办公室的产出缺口测量作为观察变量。后者的模型结果是产出潜力更平稳，通胀和实际变量之间的周期相关性更低，但在短期之外的预测中表现较差。此方法允许评估和实时监控官方趋势和缺口估计。",
