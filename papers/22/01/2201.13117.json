    "translated_abstract": "我们提出连续重复退火流输运蒙特卡罗（CRAFT）方法，将序列蒙特卡罗（SMC）采样器（自身是逐步重要采样的推广）与使用标准化流的变分推断相结合。标准化流直接训练以在每个转换之间传输退火温度，使用KL散度进行优化目标，此优化目标本身使用标准化流/ SMC近似估计。我们在概念上和多个经验实例中展示了CRAFT优于Annealed Flow Transport Monte Carlo（Arbel等人，2021），并在其基础上改进了马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗（MCMC）的随机标准化流（Wu等人，2020）。通过在粒子MCMC中结合CRAFT，我们展示了这样学习的采样器在具有挑战性的晶格场论实例上可以实现令人印象深刻的精确结果。",
