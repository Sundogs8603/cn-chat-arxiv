    "translated_abstract": "属性网络上的异常检测被广泛应用于在线购物、金融交易、通信网络等领域。然而，大多数现有的工作只考虑单一种类的交互来检测属性网络上的异常，因此无法处理多视图属性网络上的各种不同交互。在综合考虑所有不同交互并检测多视图属性网络上的异常实例仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。本文提出了一种名为 AnomMAN 的基于图卷积的框架来检测多视图属性网络上的异常。为了共同考虑多视图属性网络上的属性和所有种类的交互，我们使用注意机制来定义网络中所有视图的重要性。由于图卷积操作的低通特性滤除了大多数高频信号（异常信号），因此不能直接应用于异常检测任务。AnomMAN 被设计为聚合不同视图的特征，并使用残差学习来捕捉高频信号。在几个真实数据集上的大量实验证明，AnomMAN 在检测准确性方面优于现有方法。",

AnomMAN uses the attention mechanism to define the importance of different views and captures high-frequency signals using residual learning. Experimental results show that AnomMAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy."
