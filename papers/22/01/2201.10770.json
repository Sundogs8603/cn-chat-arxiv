    "abstract": "Cross-validation (CV) is one of the most widely used techniques in statistical learning for estimating the test error of a model, but its behavior is not yet fully understood. It has been shown that standard confidence intervals for test error using estimates from CV may have coverage below nominal levels. This phenomenon occurs because each sample is used in both the training and testing procedures during CV and as a result, the CV estimates of the errors become correlated. Without accounting for this correlation, the estimate of the variance is smaller than it should be. One way to mitigate this issue is by estimating the mean squared error of the prediction error instead using nested CV. This approach has been shown to achieve superior coverage compared to intervals derived from standard CV. In this work, we generalize the nested CV idea to the Cox proportional hazards model and explore various choices of test error for this setting.",

    "translated_abstract": "交叉验证是统计学习中用于估计模型测试误差的最常用技术之一，但其行为仍未完全理解。研究表明，使用交叉验证估计得到的标准测试误差的置信区间可能低于名义水平。这种现象是因为在交叉验证过程中，每个样本都同时用于训练和测试，导致估计的误差之间存在相关性。如果不考虑这种相关性，估计的方差会小于应有的值。解决这个问题的一种方法是使用嵌套交叉验证来估计预测误差的均方误差。研究表明，与使用标准交叉验证得到的置信区间相比，这种方法能够实现更好的覆盖率。本研究将嵌套交叉验证思想推广到Cox比例风险模型，并探索了该设置下的各种测试误差选择。",
