    "translated_abstract": "图卷积网络 (GCN) 是用于基于图的半监督学习的先驱模型。然而，GCN 在标记稀疏的图上表现不佳。其两层版本不能有效地将标签信息传播到整个图结构（即欠平滑问题），而其深层版本则过度平滑且难以训练（即过度平滑问题）。为了解决这两个问题，我们提出了一种新的图神经网络，称为 GND-Nets（图神经扩散网络），它在单层中利用了顶点的局部和全局邻域信息。利用浅层网络可以缓解过度平滑问题，而利用局部和全局邻域信息可以缓解欠平滑问题。顶点的局部和全局邻域信息的利用是通过一种称为神经扩散的新图扩散方法实现的，该方法将神经网络融入传统的线性和非线性图扩散中。",
