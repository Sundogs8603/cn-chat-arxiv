    "translated_abstract": "最近，深度强化学习引起了很多关注。在自动驾驶、游戏玩法、分子重组和机器人等各个领域都取得了惊人的成果。在所有这些领域中，计算机程序已经学会了自我解决困难问题。它们已经学会了飞行模型直升机和进行像环和翻滚这样的特技动作。在某些应用中，它们甚至比最好的人类表现得更好，例如 Atari、围棋、扑克和星际争霸。深度强化学习探索复杂环境的方式让我们想起了孩子们的学习方式，通过尝试、得到反馈和再次尝试来充满乐趣地学习。计算机似乎真正具备了人类学习的方面，这触动了人工智能梦想的核心。研究成功引起了教育工作者的关注，学校开始开设相关课程。本书的目的就是提供深度强化学习的全面概述。",
