    "translated_abstract": "从学习辅助到陪伴，社交机器人承诺提升日常生活的许多方面。然而，社交机器人尚未广泛应用，部分原因是它们不会根据新用户自适应行为，并且未提供足够的隐私保护。中心化学习通过阻止在线学习新经验和要求存储隐私敏感数据来限制了这些。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种分散学习的替代方案，改善了社交机器人的隐私和个性化。我们结合了两种机器学习方法，联邦学习和连续学习，以捕捉分布在物理上的机器人之间和在时间上的重复机器人相遇中的交互动态。我们定义了一组在分散机器人学习场景中应该平衡的标准。我们还开发了一个新的算法——弹性传输（Elastic Transfer），利用贝叶斯推断和在线学习来平衡个体存储和全局信息共享的需求。",
