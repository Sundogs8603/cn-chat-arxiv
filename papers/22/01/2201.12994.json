    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）已成为机器学习领域的重要研究课题。现有的GNN模型通常分为两种类型：基于多项式图滤波器设计的频谱GNNs和以消息传递方案作为模型基础的空间GNNs。对于频谱GNNs的表达能力和普适性，自然的方法是改进基函数的设计，以提高近似能力。至于空间GNNs，像图同构网络（GIN）这样的模型通过分析其表达能力来进行图同构测试。最近，有人尝试建立空间GNNs与几何概念如曲率和细胞束以及物理现象如振荡器之间的联系。然而，尽管最近取得了一些进展，但在几何和物理的角度上，关于空间GNNs普适性的综合分析仍然缺乏。在本文中，我们提出了一种受距离几何问题启发的图神经网络（MGNN）。",
