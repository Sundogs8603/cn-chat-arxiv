    "abstract": "Machine learning potentials have emerged as a means to enhance the accuracy of biomolecular simulations. However, their application is constrained by the significant computational cost arising from the vast number of parameters compared to traditional molecular mechanics. To tackle this issue, we introduce an optimized implementation of the hybrid method (NNP/MM), which combines neural network potentials (NNP) and molecular mechanics (MM). This approach models a portion of the system, such as a small molecule, using NNP while employing MM for the remaining system to boost efficiency. By conducting molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on various protein-ligand complexes and metadynamics (MTD) simulations on a ligand, we showcase the capabilities of our implementation of NNP/MM. It has enabled us to increase the simulation speed by 5 times and achieve a combined sampling of one microsecond for each complex, marking the longest simulations ever reported for this class of simulation.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习势已经成为增强生物分子模拟准确性的手段。然而，与传统分子力学相比，它们的应用受到大量参数带来的显著计算成本的限制。为解决这个问题，我们引入了混合方法（NNP/MM）的优化实现，它结合了神经网络势（NNP）和分子力学（MM）。这种方法使用NNP来模拟系统的一部分（如小分子），同时使用MM来提高效率。通过对各种蛋白质-配体复合物进行分子动力学（MD）模拟和对配体进行元动力学（MTD）模拟，我们展示了我们的NNP/MM实现的能力。它使我们能够将模拟速度提高了5倍，并在每个复合物上实现了1微秒的联合采样，成为迄今为止报道的这类模拟中最长的模拟。",
