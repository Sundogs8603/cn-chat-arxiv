We start by assuming that the data only has two time periods. We also assume that from period one to two, the treatment of some units, the switchers, changes, while the treatment of other units, the stayers, does not change.

Our estimators only rely on parallel trends assumptions, unlike commonly used two-way fixed effects regressions that also rely on homogeneous treatment effect assumptions. Comparing switchers and stayers with the same period-one treatment is important: unconditional comparisons of switchers and stayers implicitly assume constant treatment effects over time.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种针对在每个时期连续分布的处理的新的差异性区别估计器，这种情况经常发生在贸易关税或温度等情况下。我们首先假设该数据仅有两个时期。我们还假设在第一时期到第二时期，某些单位（即切换者）的处理发生了变化，而其他单位（即保持者）的处理没有变化。然后，我们的估计器将切换者和保持者在第一时期的处理值相同的情况下的结果演变进行比较。我们的估计器仅依赖于并行趋势假设，不像常用的双向固定效应回归模型还依赖于均匀处理效应假设。比较具有相同第一时期处理的切换者和保持者是很重要的：无条件比较切换者和保持者隐含地假设处理效应随时间保持不变。对于连续处理，切换者无法与具有完全相同第一时期处理的保持者匹配。",

The method effectively addresses the issue of changing treatment effects over time by comparing switchers and stayers with the same period-one treatment."
