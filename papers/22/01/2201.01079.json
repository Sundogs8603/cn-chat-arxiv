    "translated_abstract": "现代应用中存在多视图多标签学习问题，每个样本具有多个视图特征，多个标签通过共同的视图相关联。目前的方法通常不能直接处理每个样本只观察到部分特征和标签的情况，并忽略了真实世界问题中存在的噪声视图和不均衡标签。在本文中，我们提出了一种新方法来克服这些限制。它将不完全的视图和弱标签一起嵌入到自适应权重的低维子空间中，并通过自适应Hilbert-Schmidt独立准则（HSIC）的嵌入权重矩阵之间的差异来减少冗余。此外，它通过聚焦损失自适应学习视图的重要性以检测噪声视图，并通过聚焦损失减轻标签不平衡问题。对四个真实世界多视图多标签数据集的实验证明了所提方法的有效性。",
