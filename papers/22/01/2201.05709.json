Focusing on S&P 500 index firms over 2014-2020 and defining peer groups in terms of firms' greenhouse gas emission levels, we find that, on average, about 20% of the stocks differentiate themselves from their peers in terms of future performance. We see a much higher time-variation in this opportunity set within brown stocks. Furthermore, the performance heterogeneity has decreased over time, especially for green stocks, implying that it is now more difficult for investment managers to deploy their skills when choosing among low-GHG intensity stocks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们使用 Ardia 和 Boudt (2018) 的同行绩效比率探索绿色和棕色股票投资组合中实现的α-绩效异质性。针对 2014-2020 年间 S&P 500 指数公司并以公司温室气体排放水平为基础定义同行组，我们发现平均约 20% 的股票从其同行中以未来绩效区分出自我。我们看到这种机会集在棕色股票中的时变性要高得多。此外，绩效异质性随时间降低，特别是对于绿色股票，这意味着在选择低温室气体强度股票时，投资经理现在更难部署其技能。",

Based on S&P 500 index firms between 2014 and 2020 and defining peer groups in terms of firms' greenhouse gas emission levels, the study finds that about 20% of the stocks differentiate themselves from their peers in terms of future performance, particularly in brown stocks which have much higher time-variation in this regard. The study also shows that the performance heterogeneity has decreased over time, particularly in green stocks, implying that investment managers now find it more challenging to deploy their skills when choosing low-GHG intensity stocks."
