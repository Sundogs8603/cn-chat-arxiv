    "translated_abstract": "我们系统地研究了环境、社会和治理(ESG)评分与欧洲股市价格回报之间的联系。利用可解释的机器学习，我们检查了ESG评分能否解释经典股票因子未能解释的部分回报，特别是市场回报。我们提出了一种交叉验证方案，采用随机公司验证来缓解ESG数据的相对初始数量和质量不足的问题，这使我们能够使用大多数最新和最好的数据来训练和验证我们的模型。梯度提升模型成功地解释了市场因素未能解释的年度价格回报的部分。我们通过基准特征检测得出，相比于基本的基本面特征，ESG数据可以更好地解释价格回报。最相关的ESG评分编码争议。最后，我们发现好的ESG评分对小型和大型公司的股票回报产生相反的影响：好的ESG评分与小公司的股票回报呈正相关，而与大公司的股票回报呈负相关。",
