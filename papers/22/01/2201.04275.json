    "abstract": "In order for language models to aid physics research, they must first encode representations of mathematical and natural language discourse which lead to coherent explanations, with correct ordering and relevance of statements. We present a collection of datasets developed to evaluate the performance of language models in this regard, which measure capabilities with respect to sentence ordering, position, section prediction, and discourse coherence. Analysis of the data reveals equations and sub-disciplines which are most common in physics discourse, as well as the sentence-level frequency of equations and expressions. We present baselines that demonstrate how contemporary language models are challenged by coherence related tasks in physics, even when trained on mathematical natural language objectives.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了让语言模型能够帮助物理研究，它们必须首先对数学和自然语言话语进行编码，从而实现连贯的解释，正确排序和陈述的相关性。我们提供了一组数据集，用于评估语言模型在这方面的性能，这些数据集衡量了句子排序，位置，部分预测和话语连贯性方面的能力。数据分析揭示了在物理话语中最常见的方程和子学科，以及方程和表达式在句子层面上的频率。我们提出了一些基准，证明了当在数学自然语言任务上得到训练时，即使是当代的语言模型也会在物理相关的连贯性任务中遇到挑战。",
