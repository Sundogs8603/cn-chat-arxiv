    "translated_abstract": "无人机依赖于卫星系统进行稳定定位。然而，由于卫星覆盖有限或通信中断，无人机可能会失去来自卫星定位系统的信号。在这种情况下，基于视觉的技术可以作为替代方案，确保无人机的自定位能力。然而，大多数现有数据集都是为无人机识别的地理定位任务而开发的，而不是为无人机的自定位任务而设计的。此外，当前的无人机数据集使用了对合成数据（如Google Maps）进行离散采样，因此忽略了在现实场景中经常遇到的密集采样和不确定性的关键因素。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一个新的数据集DenseUAV，这是第一个公开可用的为无人机自定位任务设计的数据集。DenseUAV在低空城市环境中采用了对无人机图像的密集采样。总共，超过27K份无人机图像被采集。",
