    "abstract": "Vertical federated learning (VFL) system has recently become prominent as a concept to process data distributed across many individual sources without the need to centralize it. Multiple participants collaboratively train models based on their local data in a privacy-aware manner. To date, VFL has become a de facto solution to securely learn a model among organizations, allowing knowledge to be shared without compromising privacy of any individuals. Despite the prosperous development of VFL systems, we find that certain inputs of a participant, named adversarial dominating inputs (ADIs), can dominate the joint inference towards the direction of the adversary's will and force other (victim) participants to make negligible contributions, losing rewards that are usually offered regarding the importance of their contributions in federated learning scenarios. We conduct a systematic study on ADIs by first proving their existence in typical VFL systems. We then propose gradient-based methods",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，垂直联邦学习（VFL）系统作为处理分散在许多个体来源中的数据的概念而变得突出，无需将其集中化。多个参与者以隐私意识的方式协作训练基于其本地数据的模型。到目前为止，VFL已成为在组织之间安全学习模型的事实解决方案，允许共享知识而不影响任何个人的隐私。尽管VFL系统的发展昌盛，但我们发现某些参与者的输入，称为对抗性主导输入（ADIs），可以支配共同推断朝着对手的意愿方向并迫使其他（受害者）参与者做出微不足道的贡献，失去通常在联邦学习场景中提供的对其贡献重要性的奖励。我们对ADIs进行了系统研究，首先证明了它们在典型的VFL系统中的存在。然后，我们提出了基于梯度的方法",
