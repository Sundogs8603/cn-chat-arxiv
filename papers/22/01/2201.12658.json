    "abstract": "An unaddressed challenge in multi-agent coordination is to enable AI agents to exploit the semantic relationships between the features of actions and the features of observations.

To address this challenge, we investigate the effect of network architecture on the propensity of learning algorithms to exploit these semantic relationships. Across a procedurally generated coordination task, we find that attention-based architectures that jointly process a featurized representation of observations and actions have a better inductive bias for learning intuitive policies.

    "translated_abstract": "多智能体协作中未解决的挑战是使AI代理能够利用动作特征和观测特征之间的语义关系。人类以高度直觉的方式利用这些关系。为了解决这个挑战，我们研究了网络体系结构对学习算法利用这些语义关系的倾向的影响。在一个程序生成的协作任务中，我们发现联合处理观察特征和动作特征的特征表示的注意力机制架构具有更好的归纳偏差，可以学习直觉策略。通过细粒度的评估和场景分析，我们展示了得到的策略是可解释的。此外，这样的代理与人类协作而无需接受任何人类数据训练。",
