We develop a new numerical framework, employing physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), that discover, for the first time, a smooth self-similar blow-up profile for both equations. The solution itself could form the basis of a future computer-assisted proof of blow-up for both equations. In addition, we demonstrate PINNs could be successfully applied to find unstable self-similar solutions to fluid equations by constructing the first example of an unstable self-similar solution to the C\\'ordoba-C\\'ordoba-Fontelos equation. We show that our numerical framework is both robust and adaptable to various other equations.",
