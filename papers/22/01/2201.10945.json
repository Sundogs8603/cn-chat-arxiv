To tackle this challenge, we propose Grad-Align, a new NA method that gradually discovers node pairs by making full use of node pairs exhibiting strong consistency, which are easy to be discovered in the early stage of gradual matching.

    "translated_abstract": "网络对齐（NA）是基于网络结构和节点属性查找两个网络之间节点对应关系的任务。我们的研究动机在于，由于大多数现有的NA方法都试图一次性发现所有节点对，因此它们没有利用通过节点对应关系的中间发现来更准确地找到节点匹配过程中的下一个对应关系的信息。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了Grad-Align，一种新的渐进网络对齐方法，通过充分利用在渐进匹配的早期阶段容易发现的节点对来逐步发现节点对。具体而言，Grad-Align首先基于图神经网络和我们的逐层重构损失生成两个网络的节点嵌入。然后，通过计算双感知相似性度量逐步对齐节点。",
