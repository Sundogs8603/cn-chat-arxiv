    "translated_abstract": "异构信息网络（HIN）表示不同类型的实体及其之间的关系。探索、分析和提取这样的网络中的知识依赖于元路径查询，这些查询识别由多样的语义关系连接的实体对。然而，对于大规模的网络，实时评估元路径查询工作负载的计算成本非常高，当前的方法也没有利用查询之间的相互关系。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为 ATRAPOS 的新方法，用于实时评估元路径查询工作负载，该方法利用了高效稀疏矩阵乘法和中间结果缓存的组合。ATRAPOS 通过使用定制的数据结构——重叠树和相关的缓存策略，在实时检测到工作负载查询之间的频繁子元路径来选择要缓存和重用的中间结果。我们在真实数据上的实验研究表明，ATRAPOS 加速了探索性数据分析。",
