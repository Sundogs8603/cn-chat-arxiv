Recent text simplification efforts rely on manually crafted simplified corpora and comprehensive NLP tools that can analyse the target text both in word and sentence levels. Turkish is a morphologically rich agglutinative language that requires unique considerations such as the proper handling of inflectional cases. Being a low-resource language in terms of available resources and industrial-strength tools, it makes the text simplification task harder to approach. We present a new text simplification pipeline based on pretrained representation model BERT together with morphological features to generate grammatically correct and semantically appropriate word-level simplifications.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了首个针对土耳其语的自动词汇简化系统。最近的文本简化工作依赖于手工构建的简化语料库和全面的自然语言处理工具，可以对目标文本进行词汇和句子级别的分析。土耳其语是一种形态丰富的聚合语言，需要考虑诸如处理变格等独特要求。作为资源有限且缺乏工业级工具支持的语言，这使得文本简化任务更加困难。我们提出了一种基于预训练表示模型BERT和形态特征的新文本简化流程，用于生成语法正确且语义合适的词级简化表达。",
