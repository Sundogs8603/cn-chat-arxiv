    "translated_abstract": "在许多棋盘游戏和其他抽象游戏中，使用图案作为特征可以指导自动化游戏代理的操作，而这些特征通常代表着对于游戏的策略而言非常重要的棋子、空位等特定配置。在本文中，我们提出了一种设计和高效实现通用博弈的空间状态动作特征的方法。这些特征是可以根据所处区域的状态变量匹配情况来鼓励或者排斥动作的图案。我们提供了若干设计和实现选择的详细细节，并着重实现了高度通用性以支持不同棋盘几何图形或其他图形的各种不同游戏。其次，我们提出了一种高效的方法，在游戏过程中实时评估活跃特征，基于一种将活跃特征集合表示为稀疏二值向量的新颖方法，它支持与权重向量的有效点积计算。我们在几个游戏中进行了实验，包括围棋、六角、五子棋等游戏，并展示了我们的方法可以在少量活跃要素的情况下实现最先进的性能表现。",
