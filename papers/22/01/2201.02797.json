    "abstract": "Automated medical coding, an essential task for healthcare operation and delivery, makes unstructured data manageable by predicting medical codes from clinical documents. Recent advances in deep learning and natural language processing have been widely applied to this task. However, deep learning-based medical coding lacks a unified view of the design of neural network architectures. This review proposes a unified framework to provide a general understanding of the building blocks of medical coding models and summarizes recent advanced models under the proposed framework. Our unified framework decomposes medical coding into four main components, i.e., encoder modules for text feature extraction, mechanisms for building deep encoder architectures, decoder modules for transforming hidden representations into medical codes, and the usage of auxiliary information. Finally, we introduce the benchmarks and real-world usage and discuss key research challenges and future directions.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动医疗编码是医疗运营和服务的基本任务，通过从临床文档中预测医疗编码来管理非结构化数据。近年来，深度学习和自然语言处理的进步已广泛应用于该任务。但基于深度学习的自动医疗编码缺乏对神经网络架构设计的统一视图。本综述提出了一个统一框架，以提供对医疗编码模型组件的一般理解，并总结了在此框架下最近的高级模型。我们的统一框架将医疗编码分解为四个主要组件，即用于文本特征提取的编码器模块、构建深度编码器架构的机制、用于将隐藏表示转换成医疗代码的解码器模块以及辅助信息的使用。最后，我们介绍了基准和真实世界中的使用情况，讨论了关键的研究挑战和未来方向。",
