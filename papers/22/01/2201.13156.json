    "translated_abstract": "在数据科学应用中，协方差矩阵具有稀疏矩阵加上低秩扰动的结构是常见的。为了避免耗时的矩阵计算，经常需要算法利用这种结构。其中一种方法是通过维持这种结构执行矩阵求逆的Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury公式。在本文中，我们考虑矩阵平方根和逆平方根运算。当给定一个矩阵的低秩扰动时，我们认为存在一个低秩近似校正(逆)平方根的方法。我们通过建立对真正校正的特征值的几何衰减界限来实现这一点。然后，我们将此校正方案作为代数Riccati方程的解，讨论了如何计算此方程的低秩解。我们分析了通过近似求解代数Riccati方程产生的逼近误差，并通过两个数值例子说明了我们的结果。",

The correction is framed as the solution of an algebraic Riccati equation and can be computed by a low-rank solution. The accuracy of the approximation is analyzed and two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the results."
