    "translated_abstract": "在连接图中找到最优路径需要确定沿着图的边缘行进的最小总成本。这个问题可以通过几种经典算法来解决，通常所有边缘的成本都是预先定义好的。因此，在想要根据某个任务的要求以自适应的方式改变成本时，通常无法使用传统规划方法。在这里，我们展示了可以通过将成本值转化为突触权重来定义路径搜索问题的神经网络表示，这允许使用网络学习机制进行在线权重适应。当从一个初始活跃度值为1开始时，在这个网络中的活动传播将导致与Bellman-Ford算法找到的解相同的解。神经网络具有与Bellman-Ford相同的算法复杂度，并且此外，我们可以证明网络学习机制（如赫布学习）可以调整网络中的权重来增强算法的性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a method that combines optimal path search with task-dependent learning in a neural network. By transforming cost values into synaptic weights, the network can adapt the weights online using learning mechanisms. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces the same solutions as the classical Bellman-Ford algorithm, and the network learning mechanisms can enhance the algorithm's performance."
