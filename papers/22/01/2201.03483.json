    "abstract": "We propose a general framework of mass transport between vector-valued measures, which will be called simultaneous optimal transport (SOT). The new framework is motivated by the need to transport resources of different types simultaneously, i.e., in single trips, from specified origins to destinations; similarly, in economic matching, one needs to couple two groups, e.g., buyers and sellers, by equating supplies and demands of different goods at the same time. The mathematical structure of simultaneous transport is very different from the classic setting of optimal transport, leading to many new challenges. The Monge and Kantorovich formulations are contrasted and connected. Existence conditions and duality formulas are established. More interestingly, by connecting SOT to a natural relaxation of martingale optimal transport (MOT), we introduce the MOT-SOT parity, which allows for explicit solutions of SOT in many interesting cases.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种称为\"同时最优输运(SOT)\"的矢量测度之间的质量输运的通用框架。新框架是由需要将不同类型的资源同时从指定的起点到达目的地的需求所驱动的。 同样地，在经济匹配中，需要同时耦合两个群体，例如买家和卖家，通过在同一时间内等量地平衡不同商品的供应和需求。 同时输运的数学结构与最优输运的经典设置非常不同，带来了许多新的挑战。 Monge和Kantorovich的表述被对比和连接。 建立了存在条件和对偶公式。 更有趣的是，通过将SOT与一种马丁格尔最优输运(MOT)的自然松弛联系起来，我们引入了MOT-SOT平衡，它允许在许多有趣的情况下明确解决SOT。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种新的质量输运框架\"SOT\"，可以同时耦合不同类型的资源，解决了之前的传统最优输运不能同时处理的问题，同时引入了MOT-SOT平衡，提高了计算效率。",
