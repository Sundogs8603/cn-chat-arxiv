    "translated_abstract": "作为自然语言处理(NLP)中的一项基本任务，命名实体识别(NER)是NLP下游任务（如信息提取、句法分析、机器翻译等）的重要基础工具。当前的命名实体识别模型对用户来说是黑盒操作，用户没有依据来确定哪个命名实体更有意义。因此，一种用户友好的可解释性识别过程对许多人来说非常有用。本文提出了一种新颖的解释性方法BTPK（Binary Talmudic Public Announcement Logic模型），以帮助用户理解基于Talmudic Public Announcement Logic的命名实体识别任务的内部识别逻辑。BTPK模型还可以捕捉输入句子中的语义信息，即句子的上下文依赖关系。我们观察到BTPK的公共公告呈现了BRNNs的内部决策逻辑，并从中获得解释。",
