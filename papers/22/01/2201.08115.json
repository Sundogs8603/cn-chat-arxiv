    "translated_abstract": "从过去的经验中发现行为，并将其转移到新任务中的能力是智能代理在真实世界中高效采样的标志。为智能强化学习者装备相同的能力可能对它们在机器人技术上的成功部署至关重要。虽然分层和KL-正则化强化学习各自在这方面很有希望，但混合方法可能结合它们各自的优点。这些领域的关键在于利用架构模块之间的信息不对称性来偏执学习的技能。虽然不对称性选择对可转移性有很大影响，但现有方法主要基于直觉，以一个与领域无关的可能次优的方式进行选择。在本文中，我们从理论和经验上展示了序列任务中技能的关键表达能力-可转移性的平衡，由信息不对称性控制。在获得这一洞见后，我们引入了一种名为“APEx”的技能发现和转移算法，它以一种原则性和学习的方式利用信息不对称性。APEx实现了最先进的采样效率、任务可转移性和概括能力，同时保留了非分层方法的表达能力和灵活性。",
