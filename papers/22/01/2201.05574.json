    "translated_abstract": "交易费机制（TFM）是区块链协议的重要组成部分。然而，TFMs实际影响的系统评估仍然缺乏。本文利用以太坊区块链、mempool和交易所的丰富数据，研究了EIP-1559的影响，它是最早部署的TFMs之一，其不同于传统的一级价格拍卖范例。我们进行了严谨和全面的实证研究，以检查其对区块链交易费用动态、交易等待时间和共识安全性的因果影响。我们的结果表明，EIP-1559通过减缓燃料价格的内部区块差异和缩短用户等待时间来改善用户体验。但是，EIP-1559对燃气费用水平和共识安全性的影响仅很小。此外，我们发现当Ether的价格更加波动时，等待时间显著增加。我们还证实较大的区块大小增加了姐妹块的存在。这些发现提示了新的研究方向。",
