    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了CausalSim，一种用于无偏差追踪驱动仿真的因果框架。当前的追踪驱动仿真器假设进行仿真的干预（例如，新算法）不会影响追踪的有效性。然而，现实世界中的追踪常常会受到算法在追踪收集期间进行选择的影响，因此，在干预下重演追踪可能会导致不正确的结果。CausalSim通过学习系统动态和捕获追踪收集期间基础系统条件的潜在因素的因果模型来解决这个挑战。它使用固定算法集下的初始随机对照试验（RCT）来学习这些模型，然后在模拟新算法时应用它们来消除追踪数据中的偏差。",
    "tldr": "CausalSim提出了一种因果框架，通过学习系统动态和潜在因素的因果模型，消除追踪数据中的偏差，解决了当前追踪驱动仿真器的缺陷。",
    "en_tdlr": "CausalSim proposes a causal framework that eliminates biases in trace data by learning causal models of system dynamics and factors, addressing the flaw in current trace-driven simulators that assume interventions do not affect trace validity. It achieves this by mapping unbiased trace-driven simulation to a tensor completion problem and exploiting distributional invariance in RCT data."
