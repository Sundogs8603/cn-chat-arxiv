    "abstract": "A buyer and a seller bargain over the price of an object. Both players can build reputations for being obstinate by offering the same price over time. Before players bargain, the seller decides whether to adopt a new technology that can lower his production cost and the buyer cannot observe this adoption decision. We show that players' reputational incentives can lead to inefficient adoption and significant delays in reaching agreement, and that these inefficiencies arise in equilibrium if and only if the social benefit from adoption is large enough. As a result, an increase in the social benefit from adoption may lead to a lower adoption probability and a longer expected delay.",

    "translated_abstract": "一个买家和一个卖家就物品的价格进行讨价还价。双方都可以通过一直报出相同的价格来建立不屈不挠的声望。在玩家进行讨价还价之前，卖家决定是否采用一项可以降低他的生产成本的新技术，而买家无法观察到这个采纳决策。我们表明，玩家的声望激励可能导致低效的采纳以及达成协议的显著延迟，并且如果且仅如果采纳的社会效益足够大，那么这些低效率会在均衡状态下出现。因此，采纳的社会效益的增加可能导致采纳概率降低，预期延迟时间变长。",
