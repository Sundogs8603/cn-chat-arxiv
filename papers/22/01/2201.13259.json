    "translated_abstract": "生成流网络（GFlowNets）是一种学习使用动作序列生成组合对象（如图形或字符串）的随机策略的方法，其中许多可能的动作序列可能导致相同的对象。我们发现先前提出的GFlowNets学习目标，即流匹配和详细平衡，类似于时间差分学习，容易在长的动作序列中出现信用传播效率低下的问题。因此，我们提出了一种新的学习目标，即轨迹平衡，作为先前使用目标的更高效的替代方法。我们证明了轨迹平衡目标的任何全局极小值可以定义一个从目标分布精确采样的策略。在四个不同领域的实验中，我们从实证上证明了轨迹平衡目标对于GFlowNet收敛性、生成样本的多样性以及对长动作序列和噪声的鲁棒性的益处。",
