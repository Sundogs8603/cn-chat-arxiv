    "translated_abstract": "学习是一个可以根据过去的经验更新决策规则的过程，从而提高未来的性能。传统上，机器学习常常在假设未来与过去的分布相同或会以对抗的方式改变的情况下进行评估。但是这些假设对于现实世界中许多问题来说，可能过于乐观或悲观。现实世界的场景在多个时空尺度上演变，具有部分可预测的动力学。在这里，我们重新定义学习问题，将其聚焦于动态未来的概念，这种未来是部分可学习的。我们推测某些任务序列在回顾性学习中不可学习（其中数据分布固定），但在前瞻性学习中可学习（其中分布可能动态），这表明前瞻性学习在本质上比回顾性学习更困难。我们认为前瞻性学习更准确地描述了许多现实世界的问题，",
