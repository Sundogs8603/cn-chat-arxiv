    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于会话的推荐引起了人们的高度关注，这些推荐方法旨在根据匿名会话预测用户的下一个感兴趣的物品。大多数现有研究采用复杂的深度学习技术（例如图神经网络）来进行有效的基于会话的推荐。然而，它们仅涉及物品之间的共同发生，但未能很好地区分因果关系和相关关系。考虑到因果关系和相关关系之间的不同解释和特征，本研究提出了一种新方法，称为CGSR，通过联合建模物品之间的因果和相关关系来解决这个问题。特别地，我们通过同时考虑错误因果问题，从会话中构建了因果、效应和相关图。我们进一步设计了一种基于图神经网络的基于会话推荐方法。总之，我们努力探索特定“因果关系”的物品之间的关系。",
