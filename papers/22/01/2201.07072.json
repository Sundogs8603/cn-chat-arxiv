    "abstract": "We provide new insights regarding the headline result that Medicaid increased emergency department (ED) use from the Oregon experiment. We find meaningful heterogeneous impacts of Medicaid on ED use using causal machine learning methods. The individualized treatment effect distribution includes a wide range of negative and positive values, suggesting the average effect masks substantial heterogeneity. A small group-about 14% of participants-in the right tail of the distribution drives the overall effect. We identify priority groups with economically significant increases in ED usage based on demographics and previous utilization. Intensive margin effects are an important driver of increases in ED utilization.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们利用因果机器学习方法提供了一项新见解，针对医疗保险实验中的一个主要结果：医疗补助增加了紧急诊所的使用率。我们发现医疗保险对紧急诊所使用率的影响存在有意义的异质性。个性化的治疗效应分布包括了一系列正负值，表明平均效应掩盖了相当大的异质性。一个极小的群体（约14%的参与者）在治疗效应分布的右尾驱动了整体效应。我们根据人口统计学和以往的利用情况确定了具有经济重要性的增加急诊使用的优先群体。强度边际效应是急诊利用率增加的重要驱动因素。",
    "tldr": "用因果机器学习方法研究发现医疗补助对急诊利用率具有异质性影响，只有少数群体驱动了整体效应，强度边际效应是其重要驱动因素，适当确定优先群体将有效控制急诊利用率。",
    "en_tdlr": "Using causal machine learning methods, the study found that the impact of Medicaid on emergency department usage is heterogeneous, driven by a small group in the distribution, and intensified margin effects play a critical role. Determining priority groups can effectively control emergency department use."
