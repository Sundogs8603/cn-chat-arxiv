To overcome this issue, a new EM algorithm is investigated for mixtures of elliptical distributions with the property of handling potential missing data. This paper shows that this problem reduces to the estimation of a mixture of Angular Gaussian distributions under generic assumptions (i.e., each sample is drawn from a mixture of elliptical distributions, which is possibly different for one sample to another).

    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了噪声和非高斯数据缺失数据插补的问题。Gaussian混合模型的期望极大算法已经被证明在一定程度上比基于k近邻或基于多重方程链的插补方法表现更好。但是，Gaussian混合模型对于异构数据是非鲁棒的，当数据受到离群点或遵循非高斯分布的影响时会导致性能估计较差。为了克服这个问题，本文研究了一种新的EM算法，用于椭圆分布的混合物，具有处理潜在缺失数据的特性。本文表明，这个问题可以归结为在通用条件下（即每个样本都是从一个可能不同的椭圆分布混合物中抽取的），估计angular Gaussian分布的混合物。",
