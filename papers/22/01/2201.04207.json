    "abstract": "Money laundering is a profound global problem. Nonetheless, there is little scientific literature on statistical and machine learning methods for anti-money laundering. In this paper, we focus on anti-money laundering in banks and provide an introduction and review of the literature. We propose a unifying terminology with two central elements: (i) client risk profiling and (ii) suspicious behavior flagging. We find that client risk profiling is characterized by diagnostics, i.e., efforts to find and explain risk factors. On the other hand, suspicious behavior flagging is characterized by non-disclosed features and hand-crafted risk indices. Finally, we discuss directions for future research. One major challenge is the need for more public data sets. This may potentially be addressed by synthetic data generation. Other possible research directions include semi-supervised and deep learning, interpretability, and fairness of the results.",

    "translated_abstract": "洗钱是一个严重的全球性问题，但是针对反洗钱的统计和机器学习方法的科学文献却很少。本文着重于银行反洗钱，并提供了文献综述和介绍。我们提出了一个统一的术语，其中包括客户风险评估和可疑行为标识两个核心要素。我们发现，客户风险评估是通过诊断来寻找和解释风险因素，而可疑行为标识则是通过未公开的特征和手工风险指数来实现的。最后，我们讨论了未来研究的方向，其中主要挑战之一是需要更多的公共数据集，这可能可以通过生成合成数据来解决，其他可能的研究方向包括半监督和深度学习、可解释性以及结果的公平性。",
