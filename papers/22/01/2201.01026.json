    "translated_abstract": "如果一个金融资产的价格变动会影响到一个公司的产品需求，该公司可以通过调整其运营决策来应对影响。本文通过将风险对冲策略与运营决策共同应用于金融资产中，开发和解决了将风险对冲战略整合进价值定价的新闻供应商模型中的风险管理模型。我们计算了最佳对冲策略，得出了优化售价和虚拟生产量（VPQ）的明确目标函数。我们发现，风险对冲通常会降低最优售价，同时也会降低最优VPQ。但是，风险对冲导致的价格下降将减少生产的利润，从而减少保值者的总体利润。为了保证从对冲和生产中获得利润改进，需要适当的目标平均收益和需求弹性。本文提出的模型为企业确定其最佳价值和对冲决策提供了建设性的指导。",

The study reveals that risk hedging generally leads to a reduction in the optimal price and virtual production quantity, and an appropriate target mean return and demand elasticity are required to guarantee profit improvement."
