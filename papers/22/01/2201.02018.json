    "translated_abstract": "“权重约束可满足性问题（WCSP）”的重参数化是一种很常见的算法，可以用来逼近或约束最优价值。相反，超重参数化的概念（即使得每个分配都保持或增加WCSP目标的权重改变）已经被提出，但从未被详细研究过。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了超重参数化的几个理论性质，并将其与重参数化进行了比较。此外，我们提出了一个框架，利用超重参数化计算WCSP的最优值的上界。我们展示了在技术条件下，原则上可以采用任意的约束传播规则来提高这种约束计算的效率。特别地，对于弧一致性，该方法可以减少到已知的虚拟弧一致性算法（VAC）中。我们在单例弧一致性WCSP中实现了该方法，并报告了实验结果，证明了其作为预处理步骤的有效性。",
