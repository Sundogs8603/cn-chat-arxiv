    "abstract": "The rapid mutation of the influenza virus threatens public health. Reassortment among viruses with different hosts can lead to a fatal pandemic. However, it is difficult to detect the original host of the virus during or after an outbreak as influenza viruses can circulate between different species. Therefore, early and rapid detection of the viral host would help reduce the further spread of the virus. We use various machine learning models with features derived from the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and features learned from word embedding and word encoding to infer the origin host of viruses. The results show that the performance of the PSSM-based model reaches the MCC around 95%, and the F1 around 96%. The MCC obtained using the model with word embedding is around 96%, and the F1 is around 97%.",

    "translated_abstract": "流感病毒的快速突变威胁公共健康，可能引发致命的大流行病。然而，检测病毒的原始宿主在爆发期间或爆发后是困难的，因为流感病毒可以在不同的物种之间循环传播。因此，早期和快速检测病毒宿主将有助于减少病毒的进一步传播。我们使用基于位置特异性得分矩阵（PSSM）和学习自词嵌入和词编码的特征的各种机器学习模型来推断病毒的原始宿主。结果表明，基于PSSM的模型的性能达到了95%左右的MCC和96%左右的F1。使用词嵌入的模型得到的MCC约为96％，F1约为97％。",
