    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，图神经网络(GNN)易受到对抗性攻击。大多数现有的鲁棒图学习方法基于标签信息度量模型的鲁棒性，这使得它们在没有标签信息时难以实现。一种直接的方向是利用典型的非监督图表示学习(UGRL)中广泛使用的Infomax技术来学习鲁棒的无监督表示。然而，直接将Infomax技术从典型的UGRL移植到鲁棒的UGRL可能涉及一种有偏的假设。鉴于Infomax的局限性，我们提出了一种新的无偏鲁棒UGRL方法——Robust Graph Information Bottleneck (RGIB)，它基于Information Bottleneck (IB)原理。我们的RGIB试图通过保留良性图中的原始信息并消除对抗性图中的对抗性信息，来学习对抗性扰动下的鲁棒节点表示。实现这一目标有两个主要挑战：1）如何衡量图中的原始信息和对抗信息的数量，以及2）如何在保留原始信息和消除对抗信息之间取得平衡。我们提出了一种新的目标来解决这些挑战，并表明RGIB在几个基准数据集上表现优于现有的图鲁棒性方法，包括针对性和非针对性攻击。",
