    "translated_abstract": "价值函数（VF）的近似是强化学习中的一个核心问题。传统的非参数VF估计在维度灾难的情况下存在问题。因此，在高维空间中，人们采用了简洁的参数模型来近似VF，其中大部分工作集中在线性和神经网络方法上。与此不同的是，本文提出了一种“简洁的非参数”方法，我们使用随机低秩算法以在线和无模型的方式来估计VF矩阵。此外，由于VF往往是多维的，我们提出用张量（多维数组）表示来替代传统的VF矩阵表示，并采用PARAFAC分解来设计一个在线无模型的张量低秩算法。我们提出了不同版本的算法，分析了它们的复杂度，并通过使用标准强化学习环境对其性能进行了数值评估。",
