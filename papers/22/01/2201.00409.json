    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了用于一般提案的优化自适应重要抽样器（OAIS）在进行蒙特卡罗积分时的性能。我们利用了一个经典结果，该结果显示了重要抽样的偏差和均方误差（MSE）与目标和提案之间的$\\chi^2$散度呈比例关系，并开发了一个方案，可以对$\\chi^2$散度进行全局优化。虽然对于指数族提案，已知该量是凸的，但对于一般提案，这个问题一直是一个未解之谜。我们通过利用随机梯度Langevin动态（SGLD）的非渐近边界进行$\\chi^2$散度的全局优化，并利用最近的非凸优化文献的结果推导出MSE的非渐近边界，来填补这个空白。得到的AIS方案具有显式的理论保证，并且保证在任意时刻均成立。",
