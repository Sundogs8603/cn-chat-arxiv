    "translated_abstract": "科学家们已开发出数百种技术来衡量复杂系统中进程对之间的交互。但这些计算方法，从相关系数到因果推断，依赖于不同的定量理论，这些理论仍然大部分没有联系。在这里，我们介绍了237种成对交互统计量库，并评估它们在来自广泛实世界和模型生成系统的1053个多元时间序列上的行为。我们的分析突出不同数学公式之间的新共性，提供了一个丰富的跨学科文献的统一图景。接着，我们利用三个实际案例研究展示同时利用来自科学的多种方法可以揭示出最适合解决给定问题的方法，从而产生解释性的理解关系对的概念规定，推动成功表现。我们的框架提供了可扩展开放软件，使共同研究变得容易。",
