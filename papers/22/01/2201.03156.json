    "abstract": "The quasiparticle effective mass $m^\\ast$ of interacting electrons is a fundamental quantity in the Fermi liquid theory. However, the precise value of the effective mass of uniform electron gas is still elusive after decades of research. The newly developed neural canonical transformation approach [Xie et al., J. Mach. Learn. 1, (2022)] offers a principled way to extract the effective mass of electron gas by directly calculating the thermal entropy at low temperature. The approach models a variational many-electron density matrix using two generative neural networks: an autoregressive model for momentum occupation and a normalizing flow for electron coordinates. Our calculation reveals a suppression of effective mass in the two-dimensional spin-polarized electron gas, which is more pronounced than previous reports in the low-density strong-coupling region. This prediction calls for verification in two-dimensional electron gas experiments.",

    "translated_abstract": "相互作用电子的准粒子有效质量$m^\\ast$是费米液体理论中的基本数量。然而，经过几十年的研究，均匀电子气体的有效质量的精确值仍然难以确定。新开发的神经规范变换方法提供了一种通过直接计算低温下的热熵来提取电子气体有效质量的原则方法。该方法使用两个生成神经网络对变分多电子密度矩阵进行建模：一个动量占据的自回归模型和一个电子坐标的归一化流模型。我们的计算揭示了二维自旋极化电子气体中有效质量的抑制作用，这比先前在低密度强耦合区域的报告更加明显。这一预测需要在二维电子气体实验中进行验证。",
