    "translated_abstract": "现有的基于LiDAR的应用学习方法使用在预先确定的光束配置下扫描的三维点云，例如，光束的仰角通常是均匀分布的。这些固定配置是面向任务的，因此简单地使用它们可能会导致次优性能。在这项工作中，我们采取了一种新路线，学习如何针对给定的应用程序优化LiDAR光束配置。具体来说，我们提出了一个基于强化学习的学习-优化（RL-L2O）框架，以自动端到端地优化不同基于LiDAR的应用程序的光束配置。优化是由目标任务的最终性能指导的，因此我们的方法可以轻松地作为简单的插入式模块集成到任何基于LiDAR的应用程序中。当需要低分辨率（低成本）的LiDAR时，该方法尤其有用，例如，用于大规模系统部署。我们使用该方法搜索了低分辨率LiDAR的光束配置，用于三维物体检测和定位。实验结果表明，优化的光束配置可以显著提高检测性能，并降低计算成本。",
