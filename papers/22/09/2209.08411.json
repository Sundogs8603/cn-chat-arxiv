However, when this conditional distribution is non-stationary, it poses challenges for these models to learn consistently and to predict accurately. In this work, we propose a new method to model non-stationary conditional distributions over time by clearly decoupling stationary conditional distribution modeling from non-stationary dynamics modeling. Our method is based on a Bayesian dynamic model that can adapt to conditional distribution changes and a deep conditional distribution model that handles multivariate time series using a factorized output space. Our experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our model can adapt to non-stationary time series better than state-of-the-art deep learning solutions.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习在各种时间序列预测任务中展现出令人印象深刻的结果，其中建模未来给定过去的条件分布是其核心。然而，当这种条件分布是非平稳的时，对于这些模型来说，要一致学习和准确预测会带来挑战。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新的方法，通过明确地将平稳条件分布建模与非平稳动态建模解耦，来对时间上的非平稳条件分布进行建模。我们的方法基于贝叶斯动态模型，可以适应条件分布变化，以及使用分解的输出空间处理多变量时间序列的深度条件分布模型。我们在合成和真实数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的模型可以比最先进的深度学习解决方案更好地适应非平稳时间序列。",
