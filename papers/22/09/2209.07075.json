    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的方法，如物理信息神经网络（PINNs）和DeepONets已经显示出解决PDE约束优化（PDECO）问题的潜力。然而，现有方法不足以处理那些PDE约束在优化目标上具有复杂或非线性依赖关系的情况。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一个新颖的双层优化框架，通过分离目标和约束的优化来解决。对于内部循环优化，我们采用PINNs仅解决PDE约束。对于外部循环，我们设计了一种新的方法，该方法基于隐式函数定理（IFT）使用Broyden方法，该方法在逼近超梯度方面高效准确。此外，我们进一步提供了超梯度计算的理论解释和误差分析。在多个大规模和非线性PDE约束优化问题的广泛实验中，我们的方法取得了最先进的结果。",
