    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的傅里叶分析形式，并提出了与之相关的信号处理概念，用于由带权有向无环图（DAG）索引的信号（或数据）。这意味着我们的傅里叶基函数可以将适当的移位和卷积算子进行特征分解，我们定义了这种算子。 DAG是捕捉数据值之间因果关系的常见模型，在本文中，我们的傅里叶分析将数据与其因果关系联系起来，其中采用了我们定义的线性假设。傅里叶变换的定义需要对加权DAG进行传递闭包处理，根据边权重的解释，可以有几种形式。示例包括影响水平、距离或污染分布。我们的框架不同于先前的图信号处理：它专门针对DAG并利用并扩展了组合数学中的经典模比乌斯反演理论。对于一个典型的应用，我们考虑了建模动态网络的DAGs，其中边线表示时间顺序和因果关系的强度。",
