    "translated_abstract": "基于会话的推荐系统旨在利用用户的短期行为序列来预测下一个项目，而不需要详细的用户资料。最近的研究主要通过将会话视为项目之间的转换图，并利用各种图神经网络（GNNs）对项目及其邻居之间的关系进行编码，以建模用户的偏好。一些现有的基于GNN的模型主要关注从空间图结构的视角聚合信息，忽视了在信息传递过程中项目的邻居之间的时间关系，导致信息丢失，从而产生次优问题。其他的工作通过整合额外的时间信息来解决这个问题，但缺乏空间和时间模式之间充分的交互。为了解决这个问题，受对比学习技术的均匀性和对齐性特性的启发，我们提出了一个名为基于会话的推荐的新框架。",
