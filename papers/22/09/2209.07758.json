    "translated_abstract": "在对抗性环境中同时生成竞争策略和执行连续运动规划是一个具有挑战性的问题。此外，在对抗性多智能体环境中部署自主系统需要理解其他智能体的意图。现有方法要么通过对类似控制输入进行分组来离散化智能体动作，从而牺牲运动规划的性能，要么在难以理解的潜在空间中进行规划，产生难以理解的智能体行为。此外，最流行的策略优化框架没有意识到行动的长期影响并且变得目光短浅。本文提出了一种通过抽象实现智能体动作离散化的方法，该方法提供了智能体动作的清晰意图，一个高效的离线智能体群体合成流程以及使用函数逼近的对策回归最小化的规划策略。最后，我们通过对按比例缩小的自主驾驶车辆进行实验验证了我们的发现。",
