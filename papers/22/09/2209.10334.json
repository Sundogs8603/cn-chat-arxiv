In this paper, we propose a method to classify every trade, based on its proximity with other trades in the market within a short period of time, into five types.

Our empirical findings indicate strong positive correlations between contemporaneous returns and COIs. In terms of predictability, we document that associations with future returns are positive for COIs of trades which are isolated from trades of stocks other than themselves, and negative otherwise.

    "translated_abstract": "高频交易的时间接近可以包含显著信号。本文提出了一种方法，根据短时间内与市场中其他交易的接近程度，将每笔交易分类为五种类型。通过针对每种类型交易定义的适当标准化订单不平衡（COI），我们研究了分解交易流的价格影响。我们的实证结果表明，当代回报与COIs之间存在强烈的正相关性。在可预测性方面，我们记录了与未来回报的关联是正的，对于与非自身股票的交易孤立的交易的COIs，否则是负的。此外，我们利用COIs开发的交易策略在457只股票的广泛实验设置中取得了显著的回报和夏普比率，使用了为期一段时间的每日数据。",
