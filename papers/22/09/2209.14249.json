    "translated_abstract": "模拟推断的神经后验估计方法在处理基于多个观测条件下得到的后验分布时可能不太适用，因为它们倾向于需要大量的模拟器调用来学习准确的近似。相比之下，神经似然估计方法可以在学习了单独观测值后，处理推断时的多个观测值，但它们依赖于标准的推断方法，如MCMC或变分推断，这些推断方法有一定的性能缺陷。我们引入了一种基于条件评分建模的新方法，它融合了两种方法的优点。我们对由单个观测引起的（扩散的）后验分布建模，然后引入了一种组合学习分数以近似从目标后验分布中采样的方法。我们的方法在样本效率上具有优势，在推断时可以自然地聚合多个观测值，并避免了传统推断方法的缺点。",
