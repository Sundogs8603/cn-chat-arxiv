    "translated_abstract": "西尼罗河病毒(WNV)的发生代表了最常见的蚊媒性动物传播病毒感染之一。它的循环通常与适合于媒介蚊子繁殖和病毒复制的气候和环境条件相关。此外，已开发了几种统计模型来塑造和预测WNV的循环：特别是，地球观测(EO)数据的大规模可用性，加上人工智能领域的不断进步，提供了宝贵的机会。在本文中，我们试图通过将卫星图像输入深度神经网络(DNNs)来预测WNV的循环，这些卫星图像已经广泛显示具有环境和气候特征。值得注意的是，虽然之前的方法独立地分析每个地理点，但我们提出了一种空间感知的方法，考虑了附近点的特征。具体而言，我们依靠图神经网络(GNN)来聚合邻居的特征。",
