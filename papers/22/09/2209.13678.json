    "abstract": "While fairness-aware machine learning algorithms have been receiving increasing attention, the focus has been on centralized machine learning, leaving decentralized methods underexplored. Federated Learning is a decentralized form of machine learning where clients train local models with a server aggregating them to obtain a shared global model. Data heterogeneity amongst clients is a common characteristic of Federated Learning, which may induce or exacerbate discrimination of unprivileged groups defined by sensitive attributes such as race or gender. In this work we propose FAIR-FATE: a novel FAIR FederATEd Learning algorithm that aims to achieve group fairness while maintaining high utility via a fairness-aware aggregation method that computes the global model by taking into account the fairness of the clients. To achieve that, the global model update is computed by estimating a fair model update using a Momentum term that helps to overcome the oscillations of non-fair gradients. To ",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然公平感知的机器学习算法受到了越来越多的关注，但重点一直是集中式机器学习，对分散式方法的研究还不够。联邦学习是一种分散式的机器学习形式，其中客户端训练本地模型，服务器汇总它们以获得共享的全局模型。客户端之间的数据异质性是联邦学习的一个常见特征，这可能导致或加剧由敏感属性（如种族或性别）定义的特权组的歧视。在这项工作中，我们提出了FAIR-FATE：一种新颖的公平联邦学习算法，旨在通过一种公平感知的聚合方法计算全局模型，从而实现组公平性同时保持高效用性。为实现这一目标，全局模型更新采用一个动量项来估计公平模型更新，帮助克服非公平梯度的震荡。",
