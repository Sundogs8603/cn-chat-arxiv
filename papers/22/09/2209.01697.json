    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于机器学习算法图形LASSO(GL)的结合多种预测的新方法。我们将不同预测者的预测误差可视化成相互作用实体的网络，并在存在共同因子结构和结构性断点时，推广了网络推断方法。首先，我们注意到预测者通常使用共同信息，因此会出现共同的错误，使得预测误差具有共同因子结构。我们使用因子图形LASSO(FGL)方法来区分常见预测误差和特异误差，并利用后者的精度矩阵的稀疏性。其次，由于专家网络会随着时间的变化而变化，作为对不稳定环境（如经济衰退）的响应，假设预测组合权重是恒定的是不合理的。因此，我们提出了基于制度的因子图形LASSO(RD-FGL)方法，允许因子载荷和特异精度矩阵在不同制度下改变。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel method that combines multiple forecasts using Graphical LASSO under structural breaks. The method visualizes forecast errors as a network and generalizes network inference to handle common factor structures and structural breaks. It separates common forecast errors from idiosyncratic errors using Factor Graphical LASSO and utilizes the sparsity of the precision matrix. Additionally, the method introduces Regime-Dependent Factor Graphical LASSO to account for changing factor loadings and idiosyncratic precision matrix in different regimes."
