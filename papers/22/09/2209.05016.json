    "translated_abstract": "点击率（CTR）估计已经成为许多现实世界应用中最基本的任务之一，并且已经提出了各种深度模型。一些研究证明FiBiNet是表现最佳的模型之一，并且在Avazu数据集上胜过了所有其他模型。然而，FiBiNet的大型模型大小限制了它的广泛应用。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的FiBiNet++模型来重新设计FiBiNet的模型结构，从而大大减小了模型大小，并进一步提高了性能。其中一个主要技术是我们提出的“低秩层”，专注于特征交互，它作为实现模型优越压缩比的关键驱动器。在三个公共数据集上进行的广泛实验证明，FiBiNet++有效地将FiBiNet的非嵌入式模型参数在三个数据集上减小了12倍至16倍。另一方面，与最先进的CTR方法（包括FiBiNet）相比，FiBiNet++能显著提高性能。",
