    "translated_abstract": "基于高频观测的随机过程的统计推断已经是一个活跃的研究领域超过二十年了。其中一个最为著名和广泛研究的问题是估计带跳跃分量的Itô半鞅的二次变化量。在跳跃分量是有界变化的情况下，文献中已经提出了几种速率和方差高效的估计器。然而，到目前为止，几乎没有方法可以处理无界变化的跳跃。通过开发某些局部稳定Lévy过程的截断矩的新的高阶展开，我们为一类Itô半鞅构建了一种新的速率和方差高效的波动率估计器，其中跳跃行为在局部上类似于Blumenthal-Getoor指数为$Y\\in(1,8/5)$（因此是无界变化的）的稳定Lévy过程。所提出的方法基于一个两步的去偏误程序，用于该过程的截断实现的二次变化量。",
