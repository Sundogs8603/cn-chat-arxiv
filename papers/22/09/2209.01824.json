    "abstract": "The issue of shortcut learning is widely known in NLP and has been an important research focus in recent years. Unintended correlations in the data enable models to easily solve tasks that were meant to exhibit advanced language understanding and reasoning capabilities. In this survey paper, we focus on the field of machine reading comprehension (MRC), an important task for showcasing high-level language understanding that also suffers from a range of shortcuts. We summarize the available techniques for measuring and mitigating shortcuts and conclude with suggestions for further progress in shortcut research. Importantly, we highlight two concerns for shortcut mitigation in MRC: (1) the lack of public challenge sets, a necessary component for effective and reusable evaluation, and (2) the lack of certain mitigation techniques that are prominent in other areas.",

    "translated_abstract": "快捷学习的问题在自然语言处理领域广为人知，并且近年来一直是重要的研究重点。数据中的无意间相关性使得模型能够轻松解决原本应该展示高级语言理解和推理能力的任务。在这篇综述论文中，我们关注于机器阅读理解（MRC）领域，这是一个展示高水平语言理解能力的重要任务，同时也受到了各种捷径的影响。我们总结了测量和减轻捷径的现有技术，并在最后提出了对进一步的捷径研究的建议。重要的是，我们强调了机器阅读理解中两个对于减轻捷径的关注点：(1)缺乏公共挑战集，这是有效和可重用评估的必要组成部分；(2)缺乏其他领域突出的某些减轻技术。",
