    "translated_abstract": "我们使用自然语言处理算法对10个拉丁美洲国家的两个世纪900多次总统演讲的新数据集进行研究，以研究总统政策优先事项的动态和决定因素。我们证明，大多数演讲内容可以用一组紧凑的政策问题来描述，其相对构成在1819年至2022年之间发生了缓慢但实质性的转变。总统的关注重点最初集中在军事干预和国家能力的发展上。关注逐渐转向通过投资于基础设施和公共服务来建设实体资本，并最终转向通过教育、卫生和社会安全网的投资来建设人力资本。我们确定了总统的年龄和性别等总统级特征如何预测主要政策问题。我们的发现提供了关于总统关注的动态和塑造因素的新见解，拓展了我们对这一问题的理解。",
