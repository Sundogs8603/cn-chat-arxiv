    "translated_abstract": "网络虚拟化和原生人工智能(AI)范例的发展已经构建了未来无线网络作为一个在数字平台上操作的综合实体的愿景，与物理领域智能互动，为数字孪生(DT)概念的蓬勃发展铺平了道路。DT网络的最新兴趣被新颖的无线技术和用例的出现所推动，这些技术和用例加剧了网络协调和资源管理的复杂度。由AI驱动，DT的关键原则是为物理实体和网络动力学创建虚拟孪生体，其中虚拟孪生体将被利用来生成合成数据并提供专为AI模型训练而设计的平台。尽管人们普遍认为AI是DT的种子，但我们预计DT和AI将互相促进，以一种克服彼此限制并相互补充优势的方式。在本文中，我们全面回顾了AI和数字孪生之间的相互作用，讨论了DT网络的各种用例和应用，并强调了这个领域的挑战和机遇。",
