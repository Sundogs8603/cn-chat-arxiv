    "translated_abstract": "通过一个通用的、不确定的非线性动态模型传播状态分布被认为是难以处理的，通常会引发数值或分析近似。我们介绍了一种称为扩展压缩无香克特变换的状态预测方法，并将其用于解决一类在线策略优化问题。我们提出的算法通过一个状态相关的分布传播有限数量的西格玛点，这在每个时间步骤都需要增加西格玛点的数量来表示生成的分布；这就是我们所谓的扩展操作。为了保持算法的可扩展性，我们将扩展操作与基于矩匹配的压缩操作相结合，从而在多个时间步骤上保持西格玛点的数量恒定。通过实验证明，该算法的性能与蒙特卡洛方法相当，但计算成本更低。在状态和控制输入约束下，状态预测表现出良好的效果。",
