    "translated_abstract": "平衡传播（EP）是一种强大且更符合生物可信性的学习框架，可替代传统的反向传播方法。EP的有效性源于它仅依赖于局部计算，并且在训练的两个阶段中只需要一种计算单元，因此在生物启发的神经形态计算等领域具有更广泛的应用性。EP模型的动力学受能量函数控制，模型的内部状态随之收敛到稳定状态，遵循由同一函数定义的状态转换规则。然而，根据定义，EP要求模型的输入（收敛的循环神经网络）在训练的两个阶段中都是静态的。因此，不可能使用类似LSTM或GRU的架构设计基于EP的序列分类模型。本文利用现代Hopfield网络的最新进展，进一步理解基于能量的模型，并为复杂序列学习问题提供解决方案。",

By leveraging recent developments in modern Hopfield networks, the paper addresses the issue of EP models not being able to handle dynamic inputs and provides solutions for complex sequence learning problems."
