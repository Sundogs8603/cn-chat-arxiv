    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种适应性近悬停位置控制器，可部署到质量、大小和电机常数非常不同的四轴飞行器上，而且在运行时也能快速适应未知干扰。其核心算法思想是学习一个单一策略，能够在测试时在线适应不仅应用于无人机的干扰，还能适应相同框架中的机器人动态和硬件。我们通过训练神经网络来估计机器人和环境参数的潜在表示，这将用于控制器的行为调节，同时也表示为神经网络。我们在模拟环境中仅对这两个网络进行培训，以飞行四轴飞行器到目标位置并避免撞到地面为目标。我们直接在现实世界中使用相同的控制器，在两个具有不同质量、大小、电机和螺旋桨推力比的四轴飞行器上进行了测试，结果表明我们的方法能够实现成功的近悬停性能并快速适应运动变化以及外部干扰。",
