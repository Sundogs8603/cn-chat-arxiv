    "translated_abstract": "当今，基础模型已成为人工智能中的基础设施之一，为通用智能铺平了道路。然而，现实中存在两个紧迫的挑战：现有的基础模型由英语社区主导；用户往往只能使用有限的资源，无法总是使用基础模型。为了支持汉语社区的发展，我们推出了一个名为凤神榜（Fengshenbang）的开源项目，由认知计算与自然语言研究中心（CCNL）领导。我们的项目具有全面的能力，包括大型预训练模型、用户友好的API、基准、数据集等。我们将所有这些包裹在三个子项目中：凤神榜模型、凤神框架和凤神榜基准。一个开源路线图，凤神榜旨在重新评估中国预训练大规模模型的开源社区，促进整个中国大规模模型的发展。",
