We elicit redistribution decisions from a U.S.-representative sample who observe worker outcomes and whether luck magnified workers' effort (``lucky opportunities'') or determined workers' income directly (``lucky outcomes''). We find that participants redistribute less and are less reactive to changes in the importance of luck in environments with lucky opportunities. Our findings have implications for models that seek to understand and predict redistribution attitudes and help to explain the gap between lab evidence on support for redistribution and U.S. inequality trends.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在对机会和结果产生影响的运气不确定情况下，人们如何重新分配收入。我们从一个能代表美国人口的样本中挑选出决策者，让他们观察工人的结果，以及运气是否放大了工人的努力（“幸运机会”）或直接决定了工人的收入（“幸运结果”）。我们发现，参与者在有幸运机会的环境中重新分配的力度较小，且对幸运因素重要性的变化反应也较弱。我们的发现对试图理解和预测重新分配态度的模型具有重要意义，并有助于解释对重新分配支持的实验室证据与美国不平等趋势之间的差距。",
