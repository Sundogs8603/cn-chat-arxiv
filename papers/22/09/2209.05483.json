    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们提出了一种自监督坐标投影网络（SCOPE），通过解决逆体层摄影成像问题从单个稀疏视角正弦图中重建无伪影的CT图像。与最近使用隐式神经表示网络（INR）解决类似问题的相关工作相比，我们的主要贡献是一种有效而简单的重投影策略，能够提高监督式深度学习CT重建工作的摄影图像重建质量。所提出的策略受到线性代数和逆问题之间简单关系的启发。为了解决欠定线性方程组，我们首先引入INR通过图像连续性先验约束解空间并获得粗糙解。其次，我们提出生成一种密集视角正弦图，以改善线性方程组的秩，并产生更稳定的CT图像解空间。我们的实验结果表明，重新投影策略可以显著改善稀疏视角CT图像的重建质量。",
