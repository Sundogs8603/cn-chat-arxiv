    "translated_abstract": "图对比学习（Graph Contrastive Learning，GCL）已成为图自监督学习领域中一种有前景的方法。现有的GCL方法主要借鉴了计算机视觉领域对比学习的原理：通过指定完全相似的对来建模不变性。然而，当应用于图数据时，这种范式遇到了两个重要的限制：（1）生成的视图的有效性无法得到保证：图扰动可能会产生违反语义和图数据内在拓扑性质的无效视图；（2）在图视图中指定完全相似的对是不可靠的：对于抽象和非欧几里得的图数据，人们很难直观地决定绝对的相似性和不相似性。尽管当前的GCL方法表现出了显著的性能，但这些挑战需要重新评估：GCL是否能更有效地适应图的内在属性，而不仅仅采用计算机视觉的原则？",
