    "abstract": "This tutorial survey provides an overview of recent non-asymptotic advances in statistical learning theory as relevant to control and system identification. While there has been substantial progress across all areas of control, the theory is most well-developed when it comes to linear system identification and learning for the linear quadratic regulator, which are the focus of this manuscript. From a theoretical perspective, much of the labor underlying these advances has been in adapting tools from modern high-dimensional statistics and learning theory. While highly relevant to control theorists interested in integrating tools from machine learning, the foundational material has not always been easily accessible. To remedy this, we provide a self-contained presentation of the relevant material, outlining all the key ideas and the technical machinery that underpin recent results. We also present a number of open problems and future directions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本教程综述了最近在统计学习理论中与控制和系统辨识相关的非渐近进展。尽管在所有控制领域都取得了实质性进展，但在线性系统辨识和线性二次调节器学习方面，该理论最为成熟，而这也是本文的重点。从理论角度讲，这些进展的大部分工作都在于借鉴现代高维统计学和学习理论的工具。虽然对于那些有兴趣将机器学习工具融入控制领域的控制理论家来说非常相关，但这些基础材料并不总是易于获取。为了解决这个问题，我们提供了相关素材的自包含演示，概述了所有关键思想和技术机械，为最近的结果打下了基础。我们还提出了一些未解决的问题和未来的方向。",
