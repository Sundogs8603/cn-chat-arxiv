    "abstract": "To achieve inclusive green growth, countries need to consider a multiplicity of economic, social, and environmental factors. These are often captured by metrics of economic complexity derived from the geography of trade, thus missing key information on innovative activities. To bridge this gap, we combine trade data with data on patent applications and research publications to build models that significantly and robustly improve the ability of economic complexity metrics to explain international variations in inclusive green growth. We show that measures of complexity built on trade and patent data combine to explain future economic growth and income inequality and that countries that score high in all three metrics tend to exhibit lower emission intensities. These findings illustrate how the geography of trade, technology, and research combine to explain inclusive green growth.",

    "translated_abstract": "要实现包容性的绿色增长，国家需要考虑多种经济、社会和环境因素。这些因素通常由从贸易地理中导出的经济复杂度的度量所捕捉，因此缺少创新活动的关键信息。为填补这一差距，我们将贸易数据与专利申请和研究出版物的数据相结合，建立模型，显著且稳健地改善了经济复杂度度量解释国际包容性绿色增长差异的能力。我们发现，基于贸易和专利数据建立的复杂度度量结合在一起能够解释未来的经济增长和收入不平等性，并且在所有三个指标得分高的国家往往表现出更低的排放强度。这些发现说明了贸易、技术和研究的地理位置如何结合起来解释包容性绿色增长。",
