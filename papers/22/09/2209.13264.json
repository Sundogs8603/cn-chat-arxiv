    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的方法，用于从有限数量的计算机断层扫描（CT）测量中重建感兴趣区（ROI）。传统的基于模型的迭代重建方法导致具有可预测特征的图像。但是它们经常受到繁琐的参数化和缓慢的收敛的困扰。相反，深度学习方法快速，并且可以通过利用来自大型数据集的信息来达到高重建质量，但它们缺乏可解释性。在这两种方法的交叉点上，最近提出了深度展开网络。它们的设计包括成像系统的物理学和迭代优化算法的步骤。受这些网络在各种应用中的成功启发，我们介绍了一种名为U-RDBFB的展开神经网络，专门用于从有限数据中重建ROI CT。由于强大的非凸数据保真度项与稀疏诱导正则化项相结合，可以有效地处理少视角截断数据。",
