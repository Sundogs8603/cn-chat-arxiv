    "translated_abstract": "随着先进的分类器越来越多地应用于现实中的安全关键应用，如何根据特定的人类价值观恰当地评估黑盒模型在社区中仍然是一个问题。这些人类价值包括对不同严重程度的错误案例进行惩罚，并在总体性能减少特定危险案例的情况下做出妥协。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为“Meta Pattern Concern Score”的新型评估指标，它基于概率预测的抽象表征和可调节的阈值，将人类价值观引入到多分类器中。从技术上讲，我们从两种常见指标——混淆矩阵评估指标和损失值的优势和劣势中学习，使我们的指标在通用任务下同样有效，交叉熵损失在极限情况下成为我们指标的一种特殊情况。此外，我们的指标还可以用于比较在具有不同人类价值观下使用不同分类器的同一数据集。实验结果验证了我们的指标在各种数据集和模型中的有效性，同时也为未来的研究提供了参考。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new evaluation measure called \"Meta Pattern Concern Score,\" which introduces human values into multi-classifiers based on the abstract representation of probabilistic predictions and an adjustable threshold for prediction confidence concession, and can be used to properly evaluate black-box models' application effects based on human values in real-world scenarios. It can also compare different classifiers on the same dataset with different human values."
