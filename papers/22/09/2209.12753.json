    "translated_abstract": "现有的基于分数的模型可以根据其参数化方法分为约束型基于分数的模型（CSBM）或非约束型基于分数的模型（USBM）。CSBM将概率密度函数建模为玻尔兹曼分布，并将其预测作为一些标量值能量函数的负梯度。另一方面，USBM采用灵活的架构，能够直接估计分数而无需显式建模能量函数。本文证明了CSBM的架构限制可能会限制其建模能力。此外，我们还表明，USBM无法保持保守性质可能会在实践中导致性能下降。为解决上述问题，我们提出了准保守基于分数的模型（QCSBM）以保持CSBM和USBM的优势。我们的理论推导证明了QCSBM的训练目标可以通过利用两者的优势并高效地集成到训练过程中。",
