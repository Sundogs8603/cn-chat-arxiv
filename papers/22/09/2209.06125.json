    "translated_abstract": "在线实验中，合适的度量指标（比如购买）可以提供支持假设和增强决策过程的强有力证据。但是，在线实验中经常出现不完整的度量指标，使得可用数据比计划的在线实验（比如A/B测试）要少得多。在这项工作中，我们引入了缺失购买者的概念，并将指标值不完整的用户分为两组：访客和缺失购买者。为了分析不完整的指标，我们提出了一种基于聚类的$k$-最近邻填补方法。我们提出的填补方法考虑了实验特定的特征和用户沿购物路径的活动，允许不同的用户有不同的填补值。为了方便地填补在线实验中大规模数据集，所提出的方法使用分层和聚类结合的方式。所提出方法的性能与现有的比较方法相比较为优。",
