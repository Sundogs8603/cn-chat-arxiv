    "translated_abstract": "街灯是最容易被忽视的能源浪费源之一，其在不需要照明的区域发出过多的光线，造成巨大的经济和环境影响。由于传统的人工操作方式，街灯常常会在白天被打开，在晚上被关闭，这在21世纪仍然很遗憾。因此需要自动化的路灯控制方法来解决这些问题。本研究旨在通过将由计算机视觉技术驱动的智能交通监测系统与闭路电视(CCTV)相机相结合，利用CCTV视频流中的语义图像分割检测行人或车辆的存在并在其缺席时调节街灯的亮度，从而开发一种新型的路灯控制方法。因此，我们的模型区分白天和黑夜，并根据需要自动调节LED路灯的亮度。",

This reduces energy waste and environmental impact."
