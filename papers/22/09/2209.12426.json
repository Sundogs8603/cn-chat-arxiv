A perfectly informed leader and a team of followers face a coordination problem. Despite the endogenous information generated by the leader's action, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition that makes the monotone equilibrium strategy profile uniquely $\\Delta$-rationalizable and hence guarantees equilibrium uniqueness. Moreover, the unique equilibrium is fully efficient. This result remains valid when the leader observes a noisy signal about the true state except full efficiency may not be obtained. We discuss the implications of our results for a broad class of phenomena such as adoption of green technology, currency attacks and revolutions.",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文中，我们研究了领导者在全球博弈框架中的信号作用。通过研究完全信息的领导者和追随者团队面临的协调问题，我们给出了一个必要且充分的条件，使得单调均衡策略能够唯一地达到$\\Delta$-合理化，并且保证均衡的唯一性。此外，这个唯一的均衡是完全高效的。当领导者观察到一个噪音信号而不是真实状态时，这个结果仍然成立，但可能无法达到完全的效率。我们讨论了这些结果对广泛的现象，如绿色技术的采用、货币攻击和革命等的影响。",
