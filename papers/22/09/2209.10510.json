    "translated_abstract": "给定一个人的肖像图像和目标照明的环境图，肖像照明旨在重新照明图像中的人物，好像该人出现在具有目标照明的环境中。为了实现高质量的结果，最近的方法依赖于深度学习。一种有效的方法是使用具有高保真度的输入-输出配对的数据集来监督训练深度神经网络，该数据集是利用光台捕捉到的。然而，获取这样的数据需要昂贵的特殊捕捉设备和耗时的努力，限制只有少数资源丰富的实验室才能使用。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一种新的方法，可以在不需要光台的情况下与最先进的重新照明方法相媲美。我们的方法基于一个认识，即肖像图像的成功重新照明取决于两个条件。首先，该方法需要模仿基于物理原理的重新照明的行为。其次，输出必须是照片质量的。",
