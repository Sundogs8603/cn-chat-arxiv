    "abstract": "We propose an approach for systematic reasoning that produces human interpretable proof trees grounded in a factbase. Our approach evokes classic Prolog-based inference engines, where we replace handcrafted rules by combining neural language modeling, guided generation, and semiparametric dense retrieval. We demonstrate this approach through a novel system, NELLIE, which dynamically instantiates interpretable inference rules that capture and score entailment (de)compositions over natural language statements. This leads to strong performance, as shown in the scientific reasoning domain, while also producing reasoning traces showing how answers derive logically from the composition of human-verified facts.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个系统性推理的方法，可以产生基于事实库的人类可解释的证明树。我们的方法引发了经典的基于 Prolog 的推理引擎，其中我们通过结合神经语言建模、引导生成和半参数密集检索来替换手工制定的规则。我们通过一个新颖的系统 NELLIE 来演示这种方法，该系统动态地实例化可解释的推理规则，对自然语言语句的蕴含（去）组合进行捕捉和评分。这导致了强大的性能，在科学推理领域展示了如何逻辑地从经过人工验证的事实的组合中推导出答案的推理痕迹。",
