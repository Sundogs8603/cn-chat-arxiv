    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在上行免授权非正交多址接入（NOMA）中的多用户检测（MUD）问题，其中接入点需要识别活动物联网（IoT）设备的总数和正确的身份，并解码它们传输的数据。我们假设IoT设备使用复杂的扩频序列，并按照突发稀疏模型以随机接入方式传输信息，其中一些IoT设备在多个相邻时间槽中以高概率传输数据，而其他设备在一个帧内只传输一次。利用时间相关性，我们提出了一种基于注意力的双向长短期记忆（BiLSTM）网络来解决MUD问题。BiLSTM网络使用前向和反向LSTM创建设备激活历史的模式，而注意力机制为设备激活点提供重要的上下文。通过这样做，可以按照层次路径检测活动设备。",
