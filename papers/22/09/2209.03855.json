    "translated_abstract": "多目标优化问题在机器人领域中十分普遍，如机器人操纵任务的优化需要联合考虑抓取姿态配置、碰撞和关节限制等因素。虽然一些需求可以轻松手工设计，例如轨迹的平滑性，但是一些任务特定的目标需要从数据中学习得到。本文介绍了一种通过扩散模型学习数据驱动的SE(3)成本函数的方法。扩散模型可以表示高度表现力的多模态分布，并由于其得分匹配训练目标而在整个空间内显示出适当的梯度。将成本函数学习为扩散模型可以将其与其他成本无缝集成到单个可微分的目标函数中，实现联合梯度优化。在本文中，我们着重研究了学习6DoF抓取的SE(3)扩散模型，从而产生了一种新的框架，无需解耦抓取选择和运动计划即可进行联合抓取和运动优化。",
