    "translated_abstract": "尽管神经网络在计算机视觉任务上取得了成功，但数字“神经元”是对生物神经元的一种非常不精确的近似。当前的学习方法旨在在数字设备上进行，具有像图像帧这样的数字数据表示。相比之下，生物视觉系统通常比最先进的数字计算机视觉算法更具能力和效率。事件相机是一种新兴的传感器技术，它模仿生物视觉，使用异步触发的像素，放弃了图像帧的概念。为了利用现代学习技术，许多基于事件的算法不得不将事件积累回图像帧，从而浪费了事件相机的优势。我们采用相反的理念，开发了一种新型神经网络，该网络更接近原始事件数据流。我们在角速度回归和竞争光流估计方面展示了最先进的性能，同时避免了积累事件到图像帧的过程。",
