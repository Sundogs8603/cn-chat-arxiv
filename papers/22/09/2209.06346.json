    "abstract": "Twenty20 cricket, sometimes written Twenty-20, and often abbreviated to T20, is a short form of cricket. In a Twenty20 game the two teams of 11 players have a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum of 20 overs. This version of cricket is especially unpredictable and is one of the reasons it has gained popularity over recent times. However, in this paper we try four different machine learning approaches for predicting the results of T20 Cricket Matches. Specifically we take in to account: previous performance statistics of the players involved in the competing teams, ratings of players obtained from reputed cricket statistics websites, clustering the players' with similar performance statistics and propose a novel method using an ELO based approach to rate players. We compare the performances of each of these feature engineering approaches by using different ML algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines, bayes network, decision tree, random forest.",

    "translated_abstract": "Twenty20板球是板球的一种短式形式，每个队伍有一个局，局限于最多20个回合。本文尝试了四种不同的机器学习方法，用于预测Twenty20板球比赛的结果。具体来说，我们考虑了参与竞争队伍的球员的以往表现统计、从著名板球统计网站获得的球员评级、将具有类似表现统计的球员进行分类以及提出了一种基于ELO方法的新颖评级球员的方法。我们通过使用不同的机器学习算法，包括逻辑回归、支持向量机、贝叶斯网络、决策树和随机森林，比较了每种特征工程方法的表现。",
