Deep convolutional neural networks show promising results in classifying facial expressions of adults. However, classifier models trained with adult benchmark data are unsuitable for learning child expressions due to discrepancies in psychophysical development. Similarly, models trained with child data perform poorly in adult expression classification. We propose domain adaptation to concurrently align distributions of adult and child expressions in a shared latent space for robust classification of either domain. Furthermore, age variations in facial images are studied in age-invariant face recognition yet remain unleveraged in adult-child expression classification. We take inspiration from multiple fields and propose deep adaptive FACial",

    "translated_abstract": "面部情感成像可用于测量儿童到成人阶段的心理生理特征，应用于教育、医疗保健、娱乐等领域。深度卷积神经网络在成人面部表情分类中展现出有希望的结果。然而，用成人基准数据训练的分类器模型不适合学习儿童表情，因为心理物理发展存在差异。同样地，用儿童数据训练的模型在成人表情分类上表现不佳。我们提出领域自适应，同时将成人和儿童表情的分布对齐到共享的潜在空间，以便对任何一个领域进行健壮分类。此外，虽然年龄变化在面部图像中受到年龄不变人脸识别的研究，但在成人-儿童表情分类中仍未得到利用。我们从多个领域汲取灵感，提出深度自适应LANDMARK特征融合以实现精准的成人-儿童面部表情分类。",
