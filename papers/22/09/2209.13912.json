Existing methodological and application-related literature, such as textual classification and proposal classification, are insufficient in jointly addressing the three key unique issues introduced by interdisciplinary proposal data: 1) the hierarchical structure of discipline labels of a proposal from coarse-grain to fine-grain, e.g., from information science to AI to fundamentals of AI. 2) the heterogeneous semantics of various main textual parts that play different roles in a proposal; 3) the number of proposals is imbalanced between no",

    "translated_abstract": "资助机构依赖于领域专家和研究提案之间的主题匹配来指定提案审阅人。随着提案越来越跨学科，如何准确地对提案的跨学科性质进行建模和分类，并找到具有合适专业知识的专家审阅人变得具有挑战性。解决这一挑战的关键步骤是准确地对提案的跨学科标签进行建模和分类。现有的方法和应用相关文献，如文本分类和提案分类，在同时解决由跨学科提案数据引入的三个关键问题方面还不足：1）提案的学科标签具有从粗粒度到细粒度的层次结构，例如从信息科学到AI到AI的基本原理。2）各个主要文本部分具有异构的语义，起不同的作用。3）提案的数量在各个标签之间是不平衡的。",
