    "abstract": "Sponsored search is a key revenue source for search engines, where advertisers bid on keywords to target users or search queries of interest. However, finding relevant keywords for a given query is challenging due to the large and dynamic keyword space, ambiguous user/advertiser intents, and diverse possible topics and languages. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparison between two paradigms for online query rewriting: Generative (NLG) and Dense Retrieval (DR) methods. We observe that both methods offer complementary benefits that are additive. As a result, we show that around 40% of the high-quality keywords retrieved by the two approaches are unique and not retrieved by the other. To leverage the strengths of both methods, we propose CLOVER-Unity, a novel approach that unifies generative and dense retrieval methods in one single model. Through offline experiments, we show that the NLG and DR components of CLOVER-Unity consistently outperform individually trained NLG and DR",

    "translated_abstract": "赞助搜索是搜索引擎的一个关键收入来源，广告主通过竞价方式针对用户或感兴趣的搜索查询竞标关键字。然而，由于关键字空间庞大且动态变化、模糊的用户/广告主意图以及各种可能的主题和语言，找到与给定查询相关的关键字非常具有挑战性。本文介绍了在线查询重写的两种范式：生成式（NLG）和密集检索（DR）方法之间的全面比较。我们观察到两种方法都提供了互补的且可相加的优势。因此，我们展示了由这两种方法检索到的高质量关键字中有约40%是独特的，而另一种方法没有找到。为了发挥两种方法的优势，我们提出了CLOVER-Unity，这是一种将生成式与密集检索方法结合在一个模型中的新方法。通过离线实验，我们展示了CLOVER-Unity的NLG和DR组件始终优于单独训练的NLG和DR组件以及其他强基线模型，具有检索到关键字的相关性和多样性。",
