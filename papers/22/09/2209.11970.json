    "abstract": "In light of widespread evidence of parameter instability in macroeconomic models, many time-varying parameter (TVP) models have been proposed. This paper proposes a nonparametric TVP-VAR model using Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) that models the TVPs as an unknown function of effect modifiers. The novelty of this model arises from the fact that the law of motion driving the parameters is treated nonparametrically. This leads to great flexibility in the nature and extent of parameter change, both in the conditional mean and in the conditional variance. Parsimony is achieved through adopting nonparametric factor structures and use of shrinkage priors. In an application to US macroeconomic data, we illustrate the use of our model in tracking both the evolving nature of the Phillips curve and how the effects of business cycle shocks on inflation measures vary nonlinearly with changes in the effect modifiers.",

    "translated_abstract": "鉴于宏观经济模型中参数不稳定的广泛证据，许多时变参数（TVP）模型已被提出。本文提出了一种非参数TVP-VAR模型，使用贝叶斯加法回归树（BART）将TVP模拟为未知的效应修正函数。该模型的新颖之处在于将驱动参数的运动定为非参数方式处理。这在条件均值和条件方差中都能达到更大的参数改变灵活性。通过采用非参数因子结构和缩小先验，实现简洁性。在美国宏观经济数据的应用中，我们演示了我们的模型如何跟踪菲利普斯曲线的演变特征以及商业周期冲击对通胀测量的影响如何与效应变量的变化呈非线性变化。",
