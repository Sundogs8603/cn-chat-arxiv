    "abstract": "Researchers are more likely to share notable findings. As a result, published findings tend to overstate the magnitude of real-world phenomena. This bias is a natural concern for asset pricing research, which has found hundreds of return predictors and little consensus on their origins.  Empirical evidence on publication bias comes from large scale meta-studies. Meta-studies of cross-sectional return predictability have settled on four stylized facts that demonstrate publication bias is not a dominant factor: (1) almost all findings can be replicated, (2) predictability persists out-of-sample, (3) empirical $t$-statistics are much larger than 2.0, and (4) predictors are weakly correlated. Each of these facts has been demonstrated in at least three meta-studies.  Empirical Bayes statistics turn these facts into publication bias corrections. Estimates from three meta-studies find that the average correction (shrinkage) accounts for only 10 to 15 percent of in-sample mean returns and that",

    "translated_abstract": "研究人员更有可能分享显著的研究结果。因此，发表的结果往往夸大了真实世界现象的幅度。这种偏倚是资产定价研究的一个自然关注点，该领域发现了数百个收益预测因子，但对其起源没有共识。大规模元研究提供了关于发布偏倚的实证证据。横截面收益可预测性的元研究已经确定了四个表征发布偏倚不是主要因素的特征：（1）几乎所有的研究结果都能复制，（2）预测能力在样本外仍然存在，（3）经验t统计量远大于2.0，（4）预测因子弱相关。这些特征在至少三个元研究中都被证明。经验贝叶斯统计将这些特征转化为发布偏倚的校正。三个元研究的估计发现，平均校正（收缩）仅占样本内平均收益的10%至15%，而该校正值只考虑了发布偏倚的一小部分。",
