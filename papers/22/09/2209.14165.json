    "translated_abstract": "稀疏多通道盲反卷积问题(S-MBD)经常出现在诸如雷达/声纳/超声成像等许多工程应用中。为了降低计算和实现成本，我们提出了一种压缩方法，使得从时间上的少量测量中就能进行盲恢复。所提出的压缩方法通过先将信号经过滤波器再进行子采样测量，从而实现了显著的实现成本降低。我们从压缩测量中推导出了一个稀疏滤波器的可辨识性和恢复的理论保证。我们的结果允许设计一系列压缩滤波器。然后，我们提出了一个数据驱动的非展开式学习框架，学习压缩滤波器并解决S-MBD问题。编码器是一个循环推理网络，将压缩测量映射到稀疏滤波器的估计值。我们证明了我们的非展开式学习方法更加鲁棒，对选择有噪声的单位分解算法更加鲁棒。",
