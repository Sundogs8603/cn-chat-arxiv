    "abstract": "The effectiveness of machine learning in evaluating the creditworthiness of loan applicants has been demonstrated for a long time. However, there is concern that the use of automated decision-making processes may result in unequal treatment of groups or individuals, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes. This paper seeks to address this issue by evaluating the effectiveness of 12 leading bias mitigation methods across 5 different fairness metrics, as well as assessing their accuracy and potential profitability for financial institutions. Through our analysis, we have identified the challenges associated with achieving fairness while maintaining accuracy and profitabiliy, and have highlighted both the most successful and least successful mitigation methods. Ultimately, our research serves to bridge the gap between experimental machine learning and its practical applications in the finance industry.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在评估贷款申请人的信用价值方面的有效性已经被证明了很长一段时间。然而，使用自动决策过程可能导致对某些群体或个人进行不平等对待，进而导致歧视性结果，这引起了人们的关注。本文通过评估12种主要的偏差缓解方法在5种不同的公平性指标下的有效性以及评估它们对于金融机构的准确性和潜在盈利能力，来解决这个问题。通过我们的分析，我们已经确定了在保持准确性和盈利能力的同时实现公平所面临的挑战，并突出了最成功和最不成功的缓解方法。最终，我们的研究旨在弥合实验机器学习与其在金融行业中的实际应用之间的差距。",
