    "translated_abstract": "去噪扩散模型是计算机视觉领域中的新兴主题，展现了在生成建模领域中非凡的结果。扩散模型是一种基于深度学习的生成模型，由两个阶段组成，前向扩散和反向扩散。在前向扩散阶段，通过逐步添加高斯噪声逐渐扰动输入数据。在反向阶段，模型被任务为通过逐步学习逆转扩散过程，逐步恢复原始输入数据。尽管扩散模型的计算负担较大，即由于在采样过程中涉及的步骤数量较多导致的速度较慢，但其所生成样本的质量和多样性仍然受到广泛欣赏。在本篇文章中，我们提供了一个关于去噪扩散模型在视觉中应用的综合性评论，包括该领域的理论和实践贡献。首先，我们确定并介绍了三种通用的扩散建模方法：连续、离散和混合扩散模型。接着，我们讨论了扩散模型的各种算法和架构方面，如使用 Lévy 过程、不同形式的噪声、模型条件和正则化、多尺度架构和并行化技术。最后，我们总结并比较了去噪扩散模型与其他最先进的生成模型在多个数据集上的性能。",
