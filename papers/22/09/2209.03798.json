    "translated_abstract": "可以处理可变长度输入的神经网络模型具有强大的功能，但通常很难解释。缺乏透明度阻碍了它们在许多领域的应用。解释技术对于提高透明度至关重要。然而，现有的模型无关通用解释技术没有考虑输入数据点的可变长度，这限制了它们的有效性。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了ReX，这是一个通用框架，为处理可变长度输入的模型适应各种解释技术，扩展解释覆盖到不同长度的数据点。我们的方法在不改变现有技术核心算法的情况下，为现有技术生成的解释添加时间信息。我们在两种流行的解释技术LIME和Anchors上实现了我们的方法。为了评估ReX的有效性，我们将我们的方法应用于两个不同任务中的三个模型。我们的评估结果表明，我们的方法显着地提高了解释的有效性。",
