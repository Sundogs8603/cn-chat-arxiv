    "translated_abstract": "变分下界（又称ELBO或自由能）是许多经典和新颖的无监督学习算法的核心目标。学习算法可以改变模型参数，使变分下界增加。通常，学习进行到参数收敛到接近学习动态的稳定点值。在本文的理论贡献中，我们证明了（对于一类非常广泛的生成模型），变分下界在所有学习的稳定点处均等于一系列熵的和。对于具有一组潜在变量和一组观测变量的标准机器学习模型，这个和包括三个熵: (A) 变分分布的熵（平均熵），(B) 模型先验分布的负熵和 (C) 可观测分布的（期望）负熵。所得到的结果适用于包括：有限数量的数据点，在学习的任意阶段和各种不同的生成模型等真实条件。本研究为无监督学习的学习算法的基本属性提供了深入洞察，是对优化推理和学习的理论分析的第一步。",
