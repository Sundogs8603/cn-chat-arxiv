    "translated_abstract": "人工智能在药物发现中的应用越来越广泛，其中重要的任务之一就是分子属性预测。虽然分子表征学习的技术如此发达，但其背后的基础问题却未被认真探究。在本研究中，我们使用多种分子表征对一系列代表性模型进行了系统评估。除了常用的MoleculeNet基准数据集外，我们还从ChEMBL数据库和文献中收集了一套与阿片类物质相关的数据集以及两个额外的活性数据集。同时，我们也组装了一系列具有不同规模的描述符数据集来评估模型的性能。总共，我们训练了62,820个模型，其中包括50,220个使用固定表征的模型、4,200个使用SMILES序列的模型和8,400个使用分子图的模型。我们首先进行了数据集分析，并强调了阿片类物质中的活性断崖问题。",
