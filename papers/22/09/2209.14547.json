    "translated_abstract": "智能电表是准确需求预测的关键，但由于消费者隐私和数据泄露等问题，存在若干缺点。最近的文献中，联邦学习（FL）被探索作为一种有前途的保护隐私的机器学习替代方案，它可以在不暴露私有原始数据的情况下进行模型的协作学习，用于短期负荷预测。尽管FL具有优点，但标准FL仍然易受名为拜占庭攻击的难以处理的网络威胁的影响，这种攻击是由有缺陷和/或恶意客户发起的。因此，为了提高联邦短期负荷预测对拜占庭威胁的鲁棒性，我们开发了一个最先进的差分隐私安全的FL-based框架，该框架确保了个人智能电表数据的隐私，同时保护了FL模型和架构的安全。我们的提议框架利用了通过Sign Stochastic Gradient Descent（SignSGD）算法进行梯度量化的思想。",
