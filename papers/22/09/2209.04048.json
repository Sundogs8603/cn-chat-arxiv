    "translated_abstract": "背景 / 引言：驾驶员嗜睡是一个重要问题，也是交通事故的主要原因之一。认知神经科学和计算机科学的进展使得可以利用脑-计算机接口（BCIs）和机器学习（ML）检测驾驶员的嗜睡状态。然而，文献中缺乏对使用不同机器学习算法进行综合评估的嗜睡检测性能，并且有必要研究适用于被试群体的可扩展机器学习模型的性能。- 方法：为了解决这些限制，本研究提出了一种智能框架，利用脑-计算机接口和基于脑电图的特征，用于检测驾驶场景中的嗜睡状态。使用SEED-VIG数据集评估了最佳性能模型在个体和群体上的表现。- 结果：结果显示，随机森林（RF）在个体驾驶员上的性能优于其他在文献中使用的模型，如支持向量机（SVM），具有78％的f1分数。",
