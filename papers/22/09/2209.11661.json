    "translated_abstract": "最近，使用神经网络解决时变微分方程引起了广泛关注。其核心思想是从数据中学习控制解的演化的规律，其中数据可能会受到随机噪声的干扰。但是，与其他机器学习应用不同的是，通常已经了解了该系统的许多信息，例如，对于许多动力学系统，能量或者（角）动量等物理量将被完全保留。因此，神经网络必须从数据中学习这些守恒定律，并且由于有限的训练时间和随机噪声，这些守恒定律只能近似满足。在本文中，我们提出了一种另类方法，利用诺特定理将守恒定律固有地结合到神经网络的结构中。我们证明了这种方法对于三个模型系统的预测效果更好：非相对论情况下三维牛顿引力势中物质粒子的运动，受制动力学定律支配的杆从支撑点悬挂并施加张力，以及线性波动方程。",
