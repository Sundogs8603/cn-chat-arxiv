Many deep learning models have been proposed to conduct clinical predictive tasks such as mortality prediction for COVID-19 patients in intensive care units using Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.

    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19 疫情给全球医疗保健系统带来了沉重的负担，造成巨大的社会破坏和经济损失。许多深度学习模型已经被提出来使用电子病历数据进行临床预测任务，例如 COVID-19 患者在重症监护室中的死亡风险预测。尽管在某些临床应用中取得了初步的成功，但目前缺乏可公平比较各种模型的基准测试结果，以便为实际临床使用选择最佳模型。此外，传统预测任务的制定与重症监护室的实际临床实践存在差异。为填补这些差距，我们提出了两个临床预测任务：针对 COVID-19 重症监护室患者的特定结果预测和早期死亡预测。这两个任务是根据天真的住院时间和死亡率预测任务进行调整的，以适应 COVID-19 的临床实践。",
