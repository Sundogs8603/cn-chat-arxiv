    "translated_abstract": "在动态环境中进行导航需要机器人生成无碰撞轨迹并主动避开移动障碍物。大多数先前的研究都设计了基于单一地图表示的路径规划算法，如几何地图、占用地图或ESDF地图。尽管它们在静态环境中表现出成功，但由于地图表示的限制，这些方法不能可靠地同时处理静态和动态障碍物。为解决这个问题，本文提出了一种基于梯度的B样条轨迹优化算法，利用机器人的内置视觉。深度视觉使机器人能够基于体素地图对动态物体进行几何跟踪和表示。提出的优化首先采用基于圆的导向点算法来近似避开静态障碍物的代价和梯度。然后，利用视觉检测到的移动物体，我们同时使用回退视野距离场来防止动态碰撞。最后，",
