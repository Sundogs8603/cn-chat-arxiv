    "translated_abstract": "非结构化的文本数据是医疗系统的核心: 医生之间的医疗函件、手术报告、根据ICD-10标准对过程进行编码等。这些文件中包含的细节可以更好地了解患者，更好地管理他们，更好地研究病理，精确地报酬相关的医疗行为... 通过人工智能技术，今天似乎至少在一定程度上可以实现这一切。然而，出于隐私保护的明显原因，这些AI的设计者在这些文件中包含识别数据的情况下没有合法权利访问这些文件。去标识化这些文件，即检测并删除其中存在的所有识别信息，对于在两个互补的世界之间共享此数据是一项法律上必要的步骤。过去几十年中，已经提出了多种对文档进行去标识化的方法，主要是英语。尽管检测分数通常很高, 但它们在法语临床笔记上的表现很少有报道.",
