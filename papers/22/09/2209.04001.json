    "translated_abstract": "近年来，像加密货币和“迷因股票”等最近的金融泡沫引起了零售和机构投资者的越来越多的关注。在本文中，我们提出了一个关于在资产泡沫存在下的最优清算的博弈论模型。我们的设置允许玩家的涌入推动资产价格上升。此外，交易者将可能在不同的时间进入市场，并在上升趋势中寻求利润，但也面临不可避免的崩盘风险。特别是，我们考虑了两种类型的崩盘：一种是源于过度卖出的内生性崩盘，另一种是无法预测且独立于交易者行为的外生性崩盘。资产泡沫的普及性意味着需要考虑大数量的个体，从而自然地引出均场博弈（MFG）的形式化。我们引入了一类具有不同入场时间的MFG。特别地，均衡将取决于条件最优策略的入场加权平均值。",
