    "translated_abstract": "基于相互原子位置的相关性的机器学习框架始于对每个系统中的原子的邻域密度进行离散描述。对称性考虑支持使用球谐函数扩展该密度的角度依赖性，但尚未有明确的理由选择一个径向基础。在这里，我们研究了在围绕感兴趣原子的球形域内解Laplacian特征值问题产生的基础。我们表明，这会在球内生成一个给定大小的最平滑的基础，并且Laplacian特征态的张量积也为在相应高维球内扩展原子密度的任何高阶相关性提供了最平滑的基础。我们考虑了几个无监督的数据集质量指标，并表明Laplacian特征态基础的性能比一些广泛使用的替代方案要好得多，特别是对于更复杂的化学环境。",
