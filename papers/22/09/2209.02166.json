    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一个智能传感器网络，应用于边缘计算中，对感兴趣的信号进行采样并向基站发送更新以进行远程全局监控。传感器配备有感知和计算功能，可以在传输之前在板上处理原始数据或直接发送原始数据。边缘的硬件资源有限，产生了基本的延迟 - 精度权衡：原始测量不准确但及时，而经过计算延迟后，准确的处理更新就可用。另外，如果传感器板上处理涉及数据压缩，则由于无线通信引起的延迟可能会更高。因此，需要决定何时传感器应该传输原始测量数据或依赖本地处理以最大化整体网络性能。为了解决这个传感设计问题，我们建立了一个嵌入计算和通信延迟的估计优化框架，并提出了一种基于强化学习的方法来动态分配边缘的感知和计算资源。仿真结果表明，我们提出的方法通过实现更低的估计误差、更高的吞吐量和更低的能耗，优于传统的传输方案。",
