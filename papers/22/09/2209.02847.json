    "translated_abstract": "数字艺术是使用数字技术作为生成或创造过程的艺术方法。随着数字货币和 NFT（不可替代代币）的出现，对数字艺术的需求正日益增长。本文主要倡导使用具有对抗性训练的深度生成网络来实现稳定和多样的艺术生成。该工作主要侧重于使用深度卷积生成对抗网络（DC-GAN），并探索了解决 GAN 训练中常见问题的技巧。我们比较了各种 DC-GAN 的架构和设计，以确定一种可推荐的设计选择，以实现稳定和逼真的图像生成。工作的主要重点是生成现实中不存在但由所提出的模型从随机噪声中合成的逼真图像。我们提供了生成的动物面部图像的视觉结果（一些证据显示了不同物种的混合），并提供了有关 DC-Art-GAN 模型的培训、架构和设计的建议。",
