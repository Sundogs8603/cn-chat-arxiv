    "translated_abstract": "癌症是全球第二大死亡原因。早期诊断癌症可以挽救很多生命。病理学家必须手动查看组织微阵列 (TMA) 图像以识别肿瘤，这可能会耗费时间、不一致且主观。现有的自动检测肿瘤的算法要么没有达到病理学家的准确水平，要么需要大量的人工参与。主要挑战是具有不同形状、大小和位置的 TMA 图像可能具有相同的得分。由于医疗组织中的隐私问题和限制，学习 TMA 图像的染色模式受到严重限制。来自不同癌症类型的 TMA 图像可能具有共同的特征，提供了有价值的信息，但直接使用会损害准确性。通过选择性迁移学习来自多个小辅助集的知识，所提出的算法能够提取显示“类似”的组织图像的知识，从而在TMA图像评分方面取得了很好的成果。",
