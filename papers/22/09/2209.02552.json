    "translated_abstract": "可解释人工智能（XAI）的目标是设计方法来揭示黑盒模型（如深度神经网络）的推理过程，以便向人类解释。社会科学研究指出，这样的解释应该是对话式的，类似于人与人之间的解释。在这项工作中，我们展示了如何将XAI融入到一个对话代理中，使用了一个包括自然语言理解和生成组件的标准设计。我们根据质控的释义重述扩展了一个XAI问题库，以理解用户的信息需求。我们进一步系统地调查了适合提供答案信息的解释方法的文献，并提出了一个全面的建议列表。我们的工作是实现关于机器学习模型的真正自然对话的第一步，与一个解释代理有关的全面的XAI问题列表和相应的解释方法。",
