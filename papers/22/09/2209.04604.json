    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了一种原始-对偶（PD）方法处理鞍点问题（SPP），该方法采用原始函数的线性逼近代替标准的邻域步骤，从而得到线性化的PD（LPD）方法。对于凸-强凹鞍点问题，我们观察到LPD方法对于原始函数的Lipschitz常数有一个次优的依赖性。为了解决这个问题，我们将加速梯度下降的特性与LPD方法相结合，得到单循环加速线性化原始-对偶（ALPD）方法。ALPD方法在SPP具有半线性耦合函数时实现了最优梯度复杂度。我们还提出了一种针对具有一般非线性耦合函数的SPP的不精确ALPD方法，该方法保持了原始部分的最优梯度评估，并显著改善了耦合项的梯度评估。我们用数值实验验证了我们的结果。",
