    "translated_abstract": "避免碰撞是移动机器人和智能体安全运作于现实世界的关键。本文介绍了一种名为SAFER的高效有效的碰撞避障系统，能够通过纠正操作者发送的控制指令来提高安全性。它结合了现实世界的强化学习（RL），基于搜索的在线轨迹规划和自动紧急干预，例如自动紧急制动（AEB）。强化学习的目标是学习一种有效的纠正控制动作，用于聚焦搜索无碰撞轨迹，并减少触发紧急制动的频率。这种新颖的设置使得强化学习策略能够在真实室内环境中在移动机器人上安全学习，即使在训练过程中，也能最大限度地减少实际碰撞。我们的实际实验显示，与几种基准方法相比，我们的方法具有更高的平均速度，更低的碰撞率，更少的紧急干预和较小的计算开销。",
