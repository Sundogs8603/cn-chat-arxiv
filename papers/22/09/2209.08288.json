    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年里，深度学习在各种计算成像、传感和显微镜任务中得到了广泛的应用。由于使用的是监督学习方案，这些方法大多依赖于大规模的、多样化的和标记的训练数据。这些训练图像数据集的获取和准备通常费时费力，也容易导致有偏估计和对新样本类型的有限泛化。本文报道了一个名为GedankenNet的自监督学习模型，可以消除标记或实验训练数据的需要，并展示了其在全息图重建任务上的有效性和优越的泛化能力。在没有先验了解要成像的样品类型的情况下，该自监督学习模型使用物理一致性损失和人工随机图像进行训练，这些图像是合成的，没有任何实验或类似于实际样品的外观特点。经过自监督训练后，GedankenNet成功地重建了各种样品的高质量全息图像，包括定量相位和振幅信息，展示了其在实际应用中的巨大潜力。",
