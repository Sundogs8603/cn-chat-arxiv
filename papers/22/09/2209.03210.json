This is achieved using a neural network, where the parameters of a neural network are updated through an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) formulation. Using this method, we model these residual errors with only small amounts of data -- a necessity as we improve the simulator/dynamic model by learning directly from real-world operation.

    "translated_abstract": "实现与实际机器人接近的高精度动态模型或仿真模型可以促进基于模型的控制（如模型预测控制或线性二次型控制器）、基于模型的轨迹规划（如轨迹优化）以及减少强化学习方法所需的学习时间。因此，本文的目标是学习动态模型和/或仿真模型与真实机器人之间的残余误差。使用神经网络实现这一目标，神经网络的参数通过无迹卡尔曼滤波器（UKF）的形式进行更新。通过这种方法，我们只需要使用少量数据就可以对这些残余误差进行建模——我们通过直接从实际操作中学习来改进模拟器/动态模型是必要的。我们在机器人硬件上（例如操作臂和轮式机器人）演示了我们的方法，并展示了使用学习到的残余误差，我们可以进一步缩小动态模型与真实机器人之间的差距。",
