    "translated_abstract": "目前我们无法可靠地指定人类的目标和社会价值，以引导人工智能的行为。制定法律和解释法律构成了一种计算引擎，将不透明的人类价值转化为易读的指令。 “法律指导代码”是嵌入了法律知识和推理的人工智能研究议程。类似于合同当事人无法预见他们未来关系的每个潜在变数，立法者无法预测其提出的法案将适用的所有情况，我们无法提前明确规则，以可靠地引导良好的人工智能行为。法律理论和实践已经开发出各种工具来解决这些规定问题。与法律更为普通的用途（例如通过制裁威胁来阻止不良行为）相反，法律作为一种表达人类沟通目标和价值的表现，可以引导人工智能代码的发展方向。具体而言，法律信息学是计算规则和系统用于表示，分析和操作法律知识的跨学科研究。法律指导代码利用法律信息学来使人工智能与人类的目标和社会价值保持一致，以一种透明，负责，灵活的方式。",
