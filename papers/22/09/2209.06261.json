    "translated_abstract": "张力结构机器人由坚硬的杆和柔软的缆绳组成，具有高强度重量比和显著的变形能力，使其能够在非结构化的地形中航行并在严峻的撞击中存活。然而，由于维度高、动力复杂且耦合结构使得它们难以控制。基于物理的仿真是开发可以转移到实际机器人的运动策略的有前途途径。然而，由于实到虚之间的显著差距，对张力结构机器人进行建模是一个复杂的任务。为了解决这个问题，本文描述了一种基于不同iable物理引擎的张力结构机器人的真实世界到仿真世界的转移策略(R2S2R)。该策略基于一个可训练的可微物理引擎，通过对真实机器人的有限数据进行训练，并将包括物理属性的离线测量，如质量和几何体的各种机器人部件，以及使用随机控制策略的轨迹观察。利用来自真实机器人的数据，物理引擎可以进行迭代训练，以减少实到虚之间的差距并产生准确的仿真。这种R2S2R策略在索驱动张力结构机器人上得到了测试，并证明了使用可微物理引擎开发可以转移到实际机器人的控制策略的有效性。",

By training the engine with limited data from a real robot, the strategy can produce accurate simulations for control policy development that can be transferred to the real robot, as demonstrated on a cable-driven tension robot in this study."
