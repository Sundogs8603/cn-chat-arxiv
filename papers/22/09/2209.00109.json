    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种正则化的相互作用粒子方法，用于计算二维和三维空间中Keller-Segel趋化系统的聚集模式和近奇异解，然后进一步发展了DeepParticle（DP）方法，以学习和生成在物理参数变化下的解。KS解被近似为自适应于解的高梯度部分的粒子的经验度量。我们利用深度神经网络（DNN）的表达能力来表示从给定初始（源）分布到有限时间T之前的目标分布的样本转换，而不假设转换的可逆性。在训练阶段，我们通过最小化输入和目标经验测度之间的离散2-Wasserstein距离来更新网络权重。为了降低计算成本，我们开发了一种迭代分而治之的算法，以在Wasserstein距离中找到最优过渡矩阵。我们展示了数值实验结果，验证了该方法的有效性。",
