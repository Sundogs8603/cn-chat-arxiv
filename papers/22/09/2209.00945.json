    "translated_abstract": "通过自监督学习获取的预训练表示在即使是训练数据较少的任务上也能达到很高的准确性。与视觉和自然语言处理领域不同，IMU感知应用的预训练具有挑战性，因为公开数据集中没有足够规模和多样性用以学习具有泛化能力的表示。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了IMG2IMU，将从大规模图像中获得的预训练表示适应于各种IMU感知任务。我们将传感器数据转换为可视化的谱图，供模型利用从视觉中获取的知识。我们进一步提出了一种面向图像的传感器感知预训练方法，使模型能够获取对IMU感知应用具有特别影响的知识。这涉及在我们为传感器数据属性定制的增强集上使用对比学习。我们在四种不同的IMU感知任务上进行了评估",
