    "translated_abstract": "正则化的最优输运 (OT) 现在越来越多地被用作神经网络中的损失或匹配层。使用熵正则化 OT 可以使用 Sinkhorn 算法计算，但它会产生完全密集的运输计划，这意味着所有源都与所有目标（分数）匹配。为了解决这个问题，几篇论文研究了二次正则化。这种正则化保留了稀疏性，并导致了无约束和平滑（半）对偶目标，可以使用现有的梯度方法进行求解。不幸的是，二次正则化不能直接控制运输计划的基数（非零数的数量）。本文提出了一种新的带有输运计划显式基数约束的 OT 方法。我们的工作是由对稀疏专家混合物的应用所驱动的，其中 OT 可以用于将输入令牌（例如图像补丁）与专家模型（例如神经网络）进行匹配。基数限制可以确保每个输入令牌与少量专家匹配，这有助于解释混合权重并构建更具可解释性的模型。我们推导了一种基于 Proximal 梯度方法的稀疏受限 OT 问题，并在合成和真实数据实验中展示了其有效性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new approach for optimal transport (OT) with explicit cardinality constraints on the transportation plan, which ensures that each input token is matched with a small number of experts, thus improving the interpretability of the model. The authors derive a proximal gradient method for the sparsity-constrained OT problem and show its effectiveness on synthetic and real-data experiments."
