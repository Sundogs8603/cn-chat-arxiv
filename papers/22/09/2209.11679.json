    "abstract": "Historical interactions are the default choice for recommender model training, which typically exhibit high sparsity, i.e., most user-item pairs are unobserved missing data. A standard choice is treating the missing data as negative training samples and estimating interaction likelihood between user-item pairs along with the observed interactions. In this way, some potential interactions are inevitably mislabeled during training, which will hurt the model fidelity, hindering the model to recall the mislabeled items, especially the long-tail ones. In this work, we investigate the mislabeling issue from a new perspective of aleatoric uncertainty, which describes the inherent randomness of missing data. The randomness pushes us to go beyond merely the interaction likelihood and embrace aleatoric uncertainty modeling. Towards this end, we propose a new Aleatoric Uncertainty-aware Recommendation (AUR) framework that consists of a new uncertainty estimator along with a normal recommender mod",

    "translated_abstract": "历史交互是推荐模型训练的默认选择，但通常呈现很高的稀疏性，即大部分用户-物品对是未观察到的缺失数据。标准的做法是将缺失数据视为负样本，并在观察到的交互中估计用户-物品对之间的交互概率。然而，这种训练方式不可避免地会导致一些潜在的交互被错误标记，损害模型的准确性，尤其是对于长尾物品的召回效果。在本文中，我们从随机不确定性的新视角研究了错标问题，这种不确定性描述了缺失数据的固有随机性。这种随机性促使我们超越仅仅考虑交互概率，而是采用随机不确定性建模。为此，我们提出了一种新的基于随机不确定性感知的推荐系统（AUR）框架，其中包括一个新的不确定性估计器和一个普通推荐模型。",
