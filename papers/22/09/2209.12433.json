    "translated_abstract": "对全球气候模拟的粗略输出进行超分辨率处理 (downscaling)是制定需要长期气候变化预测的政治和社会决策的关键。然而，现有的快速超分辨率技术尚未保留气候数据的空间相关性，而当我们处理具有空间广度的系统如交通基础设施时，这一点尤为重要。在这里，我们展示一个基于对抗网络的机器学习使得我们可以正确重构超分辨率下降时的区域间空间相关性，并在保持像素平均统计一致性的同时实现高达50倍的放大。通过直接比较温度和降水分布的测量气象数据，我们发现整合气候学意义上的物理信息可以提高超分辨率性能，这促使我们将这种方法称为 $\\pi$SRGAN (物理信息超分辨率生成对抗网络)。",
