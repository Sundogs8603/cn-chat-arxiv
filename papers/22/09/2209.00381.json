In this paper we propose a new end-to-end model for performing semantic segmentation and depth completion jointly. The vast majority of recent approaches have developed semantic segmentation and depth completion as independent tasks. Our approach relies on RGB and sparse depth as inputs to our model and produces a dense depth map and the corresponding semantic segmentation image. It consists of a feature extractor, a depth completion branch, a semantic segmentation branch and a joint branch which further processes semantic and depth information altogether. The experiments done on Virtual KITTI 2 dataset, demonstrate and provide further evidence, that combining both tasks, semantic segmentation and depth completion, in a multi-task network can effectively improve the performance of each task.

    "translated_abstract": "综合场景理解对于自主机器的性能至关重要。本文提出了一个新的端到端模型，用于同时进行语义分割和深度完成。我们的方法依赖于RGB和稀疏深度作为模型的输入，并产生密集深度图和相应的语义分割图像。它包括一个特征提取器，一个深度完成分支，一个语义分割分支以及一个联合分支，进一步同时处理语义和深度信息。在Virtual KITTI 2数据集上进行的实验证明，并提供了进一步的证据，即在多任务网络中结合语义分割和深度完成任务可以有效提高每个任务的性能。",
