    "translated_abstract": "基于逼近潜在的Koopman算子或生成器的非线性动力系统的数据驱动模型已经被证明是成功的预测、特征学习、状态估计和控制工具。众所周知，控制仿射系统的Koopman生成器在输入方面也具有仿射依赖性，进而导致方便的有限维双线性近似动力学。然而，目前对于近似具有作用的Koopman生成器的方法仍然存在两个主要障碍。首先，现有方法的性能严重依赖于选择用于逼近Koopman生成器的基函数，而对于非测度保持的系统目前没有普适的选择方式。其次，如果我们没有观测到完整的状态，可能无法获得足够丰富的这类函数集合来描述动态。这是因为通常情况下我们无法获得描述动态所需的足够丰富的函数集合。",
