    "translated_abstract": "在许多视觉应用中，了解动态场景的三维运动对于估计活动情况至关重要。最近的研究主要集中在估计特定元素（如人）的活动情况上。本文利用神经运动场估计多视图设置下所有点的运动。由于颜色相似的点和颜色变化的点的模糊性，从动态场景的多视图数据中建模运动是具有挑战性的。我们建议将估计的运动正则化为可预测。如果已知之前几帧的运动，则在不久的将来的运动应该是可预测的。因此，我们首先在潜在嵌入上对估计的运动进行条件化，然后通过采用预测网络对嵌入进行可预测性约束。所提出的框架PREF（可预测性正则化场）实现了与基于神经运动场的动态场景表示最先进的同等甚至更好的结果。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一个名为PREF的框架，通过正则化估计的三维运动场为可预测性。该框架在多视图设置下建模动态场景中所有点的运动，并采用潜在嵌入和预测网络来实现可预测性。实验结果表明，该框架的表现优于其他基于神经运动场的动态场景表示方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a framework called PREF that regularizes the estimated 3D motion field for predictability. The framework models the motion of all points in a dynamic scene in a multiview setting, and enforces predictability using latent embeddings and a predictor network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms other neural motion field-based dynamic scene representation methods."
