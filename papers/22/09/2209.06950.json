    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种利用扩散生成模型的端到端优化的有损图像压缩框架。该方法基于变换编码范式，将图像映射到潜在空间进行信息熵编码，然后再映射回数据空间进行重构。与基于变分自编码器(VAE)的神经压缩方法不同，我们的解码器是一个条件扩散模型。因此，我们的方法引入了一个额外的“内容”潜变量，反向扩散过程会对其进行条件化，并利用该变量存储图像信息。决定扩散过程的剩余“纹理”变量会在解码时合成。通过实验，我们展示了模型的性能可以根据感知度量进行调整。我们广泛的实验涉及了多个数据集和图像质量评估指标，结果表明我们的方法相较于基于生成对抗网络的方法能够得到更好的FID分数。",
