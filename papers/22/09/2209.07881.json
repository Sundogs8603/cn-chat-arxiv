    "translated_abstract": "信号时间逻辑的鲁棒性不仅评估了一个信号是否符合规范，而且还提供了一个衡量公式被满足或违反的程度的指标。鲁棒性的计算基于对底层谓词的鲁棒性进行评估。然而，谓词的鲁棒性通常以一种无模型的方式定义，即不包括系统动态。而且，精确定义复杂谓词的鲁棒性通常是非平凡的。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种模型预测鲁棒性的概念，通过考虑基于模型的预测，提供了比之前方法更系统的评估鲁棒性的方法。特别地，我们使用高斯过程回归来学习基于预先计算的预测的鲁棒性，以便可以在线高效地计算鲁棒性值。我们评估了我们的方法，并使用在记录的数据上使用在形式化交通规则中使用的谓词的自动驾驶用例验证了我们的方法。",
