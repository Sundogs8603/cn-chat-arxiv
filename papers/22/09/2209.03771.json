Gradient estimators are not suited for sparse data: the gradient is mainly considered as zero while it simply does not always exists, thus a novel gradient estimator is introduced.

    "translated_abstract": "类别数据出现在诸如健康和供应链等关键领域，这些数据需要特殊处理。为了将最近的机器学习模型应用于此类数据，需要进行编码。为了构建可解释的模型，独热编码仍然是一个非常好的选择，但此类编码会产生稀疏数据。梯度估计器不适用于稀疏数据：梯度主要被认为是零，而实际上并不总是存在，因此引入了一种新的梯度估计器。我们展示了该估计器在理论上最小化的内容，并在不同数据集和多个模型架构上展示了它的效率。在类似设置下，这种新的估计器表现比常见估计器更好。在匿名化后，我们还公开了一个真实的零售数据集。总体而言，本文旨在深入考虑类别数据并使模型和优化器适应这些关键特征。",
