    "translated_abstract": "无人机系统安全运行需要具备检测和避免碰撞（DAA）能力。本文引入了AirTrack，这是一个实时的、仅使用视觉信息的检测和跟踪框架，考虑了小型无人机系统的大小、重量和功耗（SWaP）限制。鉴于远程飞机的低信噪比（SNR），我们提出使用全分辨率图像，使用深度学习框架对齐连续图像以消除自我运动。对齐后的图像在级联的主要和次要分类器中使用，以提高多个指标的检测和跟踪性能。我们展示了AirTrack在Amazon空中物体跟踪（AOT）数据集上优于最先进的基准线。多次在真实世界中进行的飞行测试，包括与通用航空交通互动的Cessna 182和Bell直升机向受控飞行无人机靠近的附近碰撞飞行测试显示，该方法满足新引入的A要求。",
