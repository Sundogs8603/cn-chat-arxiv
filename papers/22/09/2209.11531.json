    "translated_abstract": "在发布用于研究目的的大型胸部X射线数据集之前，强大且可靠的胸部X射线匿名化是一个必要的步骤。传统的匿名化过程是通过在图像中模糊个人信息并删除或替换元信息来完成的。然而，这种简单的措施仍然保留了胸部X射线中的生物特征信息，使得患者可以通过关联攻击进行重新识别。因此，迫切需要混淆图像中出现的生物特征信息。我们提出了第一个基于深度学习的方法（PriCheXy-Net），可以有针对性地对胸部X射线进行匿名化，同时保持诊断和机器学习的数据效用。我们的模型架构由三个独立的神经网络组成，当集体使用时，可以学习一个变形场，以防止患者重新识别。在ChestX-ray14数据集上的定量结果显示了一定的降低。",
