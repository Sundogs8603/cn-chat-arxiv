    "translated_abstract": "网络流问题涉及将流量分布在网络中，以使基础设施得到有效利用，这在交通运输和物流中是无处不在的。其中，多商品网络流 (MCNF) 问题是普遍感兴趣的，因为它涉及在多个源和汇之间分配不同大小的多个流，同时实现链路的有效利用。由于数据驱动优化的吸引力，这些问题越来越多地使用图学习方法来解决。本文提出了一种新颖的网络流问题图学习架构 PEW (Per-Edge Weights)。此方法基于图注意力网络，并沿着每个链接使用不同参数化的消息函数。我们通过使用 $17$ 个服务提供商拓扑和 $2$ 个路由方案进行互联网流量路由案例研究，对所提出的解决方案进行了广泛的评估。我们展示了 PEW 相对于不考虑链接的流量特定权重的架构，能够实现显著的收益，并在路由准确性和收敛速度方面实现了最先进的性能。",
