This technique coupled with the second order scheme proposed by Alfonsi (2010) for the CIR leads to weak approximations of order $2k$, for all $k\\in\\mathbb{N}^*$.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的高阶逼近方案，用于Cox-Ingersoll-Ross（CIR）过程，并使用Alfonsi和Bally（2021）开发的最新技术逼近半群。该方法的思想是使用在不同随机网格上计算的适当组合的离散化方案，以增加收敛阶数。这种技术与Alfonsi（2010）为CIR提出的二阶方案相结合，可实现$2k$阶的弱逼近，其中$k\\in\\mathbb{N}^*$。尽管存在平方根波动率系数的奇异性，但我们在波动率参数的某些限制下严格证明了收敛阶数。我们通过数值实验展示了这些逼近在CIR过程和Heston随机波动率模型中的收敛性，并展示了它们所提供的计算时间优势。",
    "tldr": "本文提出一种利用随机网格法逼近CIR过程半群的高阶近似方法，具有$2k$阶的收敛性，可用于CIR过程和Heston随机波动率模型，且优于传统方法的计算时间。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a high order approximation method using random grids for Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process semigroup, achieving weak approximations of order $2k$, and demonstrating its superiority in computational time over traditional methods. It can be applied to both CIR process and Heston stochastic volatility model, under certain restrictions on the volatility parameters."
