    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新型可逆的带交易成本的现代年金方案。退休者的财富分为遗产账户和年金账户，只能从遗产账户中取出消费。两个账户之间的每次交易都会产生固定和比例的交易成本，具体取决于交易额。退休者动态控制两个账户之间的分配策略和消费策略，以最大化消费和遗产收益。我们将优化问题形式化为具有无限时间视野的组合随机和脉冲控制问题，并将价值函数特征化为HJBQVI（Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmen quasi-variational inequality）的唯一粘度解决方案。数值结果展示了由两个阶段组成的V形交易区域。在前阶段，由于长寿信用逐渐提高，退休者会减少年金账户中财富的比例，而在后阶段，退休者会将财富转回年金账户，从而最大化长寿信用。我们提出的现代年金方案为退休者规划退休消费和遗产提供了一种灵活和高效的解决方案，特别是在人口寿命延长和消费成本上升的背景下。",
