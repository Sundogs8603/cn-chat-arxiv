    "abstract": "Positive and unlabelled learning is an important problem which arises naturally in many applications. The significant limitation of almost all existing methods lies in assuming that the propensity score function is constant (SCAR assumption), which is unrealistic in many practical situations. Avoiding this assumption, we consider parametric approach to the problem of joint estimation of posterior probability and propensity score functions. We show that under mild assumptions when both functions have the same parametric form (e.g. logistic with different parameters) the corresponding parameters are identifiable. Motivated by this, we propose two approaches to their estimation: joint maximum likelihood method and the second approach based on alternating maximization of two Fisher consistent expressions. Our experimental results show that the proposed methods are comparable or better than the existing methods based on Expectation-Maximisation scheme.",

    "translated_abstract": "正向和无标记学习是许多应用中自然产生的重要问题。几乎所有现有方法的一个显著限制在于假设倾向得分函数是常数（SCAR假设），这在许多实际情况下是不现实的。为了避免这种假设，我们考虑了参数化方法来共同估计后验概率和倾向得分函数的问题。我们证明，在温和的假设下，当两个函数具有相同的参数形式时（例如具有不同参数的逻辑函数），相应的参数是可识别的。在此基础上，我们提出了两种估计方法：联合最大似然方法和基于两个Fisher一致表达式的交替最大化的第二种方法。我们的实验结果表明，所提出的方法与基于期望最大化方案的现有方法可比较或更优。",
