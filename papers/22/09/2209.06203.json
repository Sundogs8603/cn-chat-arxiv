    "translated_abstract": "现有机器学习方法针对因果推断通常通过潜在结果的均值（例如平均处理效应）来计算数量。然而，这些数量并不能完全捕捉潜在结果分布的全部信息。本研究旨在从观测数据中估计干预后的潜在结果密度。为此，我们提出了一种新的全参数深度学习方法，称为干预正则化流。具体而言，我们组合了两种正则化流，即（i）用于估计干扰参数的nuisance flow和（ii）用于参数化估计潜在结果密度的target flow。我们进一步基于单步偏差校正开发了一个易于处理的优化目标，以有效和双重稳健的方式估计目标流参数。因此，我们的干预正则化流提供了一个正确归一化的密度估计器。在各种实验中，我们展示了我们的干预正则化流方法优于现有的用于从观测数据中估计潜在结果密度的最先进的方法。",
