    "translated_abstract": "由于边缘设备通信能力有限，大多数现有的联邦学习（FL）方法仅随机选择部分设备参与每一轮通信的训练。与同时涉及所有可用客户端相比，随机选择机制可能导致非独立同分布（non-IID）数据的显着性能下降。本文展示了我们的关键观察结果：随机选择客户端所导致的性能下降的根本原因是所选客户端中的数据类别不平衡问题。基于这一观察结果，我们设计了一种高效的异构感知客户端抽样机制——联邦类平衡抽样（Fed-CBS），其可有效地降低从有意选择的客户端中获取的组数据的类别不平衡程度。特别是，我们提出了一种类别不平衡度量，并采用同态加密方式以隐私保护的方式推导出该度量。基于该度量，我们设计了一种具有异构感知的客户端抽样机制，使客户端实现了类平衡状态，从而提高了FL在非IID数据上的性能。我们介绍了Fed-CBS机制的设计和实现，并在真实世界的数据集上评估了其性能。",
