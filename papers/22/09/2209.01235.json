    "abstract": "Online platforms often face challenges being both fair (i.e., non-discriminatory) and efficient (i.e., maximizing revenue). Using computer vision algorithms and observational data from a micro-lending marketplace, we find that choices made by borrowers creating online profiles impact both of these objectives. We further support this conclusion with a web-based randomized survey experiment. In the experiment, we create profile images using Generative Adversarial Networks that differ in a specific feature and estimate its impact on lender demand. We then counterfactually evaluate alternative platform policies and identify particular approaches to influencing the changeable profile photo features that can ameliorate the fairness-efficiency tension.",

    "translated_abstract": "在线平台经常面临公平（即非歧视性）和效率（即最大化收益）之间的挑战。使用计算机视觉算法和微型借贷市场的观察数据，我们发现，借款人在创建在线档案时所做的选择影响着这两个目标。我们进一步通过网络随机调查实验支持了这一结论。在实验中，我们使用生成对抗网络创建具有不同特征的档案图片，并估计其对出借人需求的影响。我们然后反事实地评估替代平台政策，并确定特定方法来影响可改变的档案照片特征，以缓解公平性与效率性之间的紧张关系。",
