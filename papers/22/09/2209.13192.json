    "abstract": "Automatic subtitling is the task of automatically translating the speech of audiovisual content into short pieces of timed text, i.e. subtitles and their corresponding timestamps. The generated subtitles need to conform to space and time requirements, while being synchronised with the speech and segmented in a way that facilitates comprehension. Given its considerable complexity, the task has so far been addressed through a pipeline of components that separately deal with transcribing, translating, and segmenting text into subtitles, as well as predicting timestamps. In this paper, we propose the first direct ST model for automatic subtitling that generates subtitles in the target language along with their timestamps with a single model. Our experiments on 7 language pairs show that our approach outperforms a cascade system in the same data condition, also being competitive with production tools on both in-domain and newly-released out-domain benchmarks covering new scenarios.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动字幕是将视听内容的语音自动翻译为短时文本，即字幕及其对应的时间戳的任务。生成的字幕需要符合空间和时间要求，同时与语音同步，并以便于理解的方式进行分割。鉴于其相当复杂性，该任务迄今为止通常通过一系列单独处理文本转录、翻译和分割为字幕以及预测时间戳的组件来解决。在本文中，我们提出了自动字幕的第一个直接ST模型，该模型能够使用单一模型生成目标语言的字幕及其时间戳。我们在7个语言对上的实验表明，我们的方法在相同数据条件下优于级联系统，同时在涵盖新场景的领域内和新发布的领域外基准测试中与生产工具相媲美。",
