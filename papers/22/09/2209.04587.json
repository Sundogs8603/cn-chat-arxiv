    "abstract": "Although beam emittance is critical for the performance of high-brightness accelerators, optimization is often time limited as emittance calculations, commonly done via quadrupole scans, are typically slow. Such calculations are a type of $\\textit{multi-point query}$, i.e. each query requires multiple secondary measurements. Traditional black-box optimizers such as Bayesian optimization are slow and inefficient when dealing with such objectives as they must acquire the full series of measurements, but return only the emittance, with each query. We propose applying Bayesian Algorithm Execution (BAX) to instead query and model individual beam-size measurements. BAX avoids the slow multi-point query on the accelerator by acquiring points through a $\\textit{virtual objective}$, i.e. calculating the emittance objective from a fast learned model rather than directly from the accelerator.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管束发射度对于高亮度加速器的性能至关重要，但优化通常会受到时间限制，因为发射度计算通常是通过四极扫描完成的，而四极扫描通常较慢。这种计算是一种多点查询，即每个查询都需要多个辅助测量。传统的黑盒优化器，如贝叶斯优化，在处理这样的目标时速度慢且效率低下，因为它们必须获取完整的测量序列，但每个查询仅返回发射度。我们提出将贝叶斯算法执行(BAX)应用于查询和建模单个束流尺寸测量。BAX通过使用快速学习模型而不是直接从加速器中获取发射度指标来避免在加速器上进行缓慢的多点查询。在这里，我们使用BAX来最小化Linac相干光源(LCLS)和Facility for Adv的发射度。",
