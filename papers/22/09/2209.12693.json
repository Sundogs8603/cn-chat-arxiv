    "translated_abstract": "电力网已成为日常生活中不可或缺的一部分，尽管在日常生活中往往不会注意到。只有当电力网不再可用时，我们通常才会特别意识到这种依赖。然而，重大变化，如向可再生能源（光伏、风力涡轮机等）的过渡以及复杂负载配置（电动汽车、家庭电池系统等）的能源消费者数量的增加，给电力网带来了新的挑战。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了两个基于宽带电力线通信（PLC）基础设施测量的首个数据集。这两个数据集 FiN-1 和 FiN-2 在德国低压电网的一部分实际使用中收集，向大约440万人提供服务，并显示5100多个传感器收集的超过130亿个数据点。此外，我们提出了不同的用例，用于资产管理、电网状态可视化和预测。",
