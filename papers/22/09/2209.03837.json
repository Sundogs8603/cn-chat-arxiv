    "translated_abstract": "基于门定义的量子点（QDs）的量子计算机预计能够实现规模化。然而，随着量子比特数量的增加，手动校准这些系统的负担变得不合理，必须使用自动调谐。最近已经有一系列自动调谐不同QD参数的演示，例如粗略的门范围、全局状态拓扑（例如单个QD、双重QD）、电荷和隧道耦合，以及使用各种方法。在这里，我们展示了一组直观、可靠和数据高效的工具，用于自动调谐全局状态和电荷，这个框架被称为物理信息驱动的调谐（PIT）。PIT的第一个模块是一种基于行动的算法，它将机器学习分类器与物理知识相结合，以导航到目标全局状态。第二个模块使用一系列一维测量来调节到目标电荷状态，首先将QDs完全放空，然后校准电容耦合并导航到目标状态。",
