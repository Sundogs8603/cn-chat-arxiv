    "translated_abstract": "为自主系统提供正式的安全和性能保证变得日益重要。哈密顿-雅科比（HJ）可达性分析是一种流行的形式验证工具，用于提供这些保证，因为它可以处理一般非线性系统动态、有界对抗系统干扰以及状态和输入约束。但是，它涉及到求解PDE，其计算和内存复杂度随着状态维度的增加呈指数级增长，使其在大型系统上的直接使用变得不可行。最近提出的DeepReach方法通过利用正弦神经PDE求解器来克服了这一挑战，用于解决高维可达性问题，其计算要求随可达管复杂性而不是状态空间维度而变化。不幸的是，神经网络可能会出现错误，因此计算出的解决方案可能不安全，这没有达到我们提供正式安全保障的总体目标。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一个称为Safe DeepReach的框架，用于为DeepReach方法生成正式安全保障。我们的框架将新颖的Lipschitz连续性分析与区间边界传播方法相结合，以有效和可伸缩的方式保证解决方案的安全性。我们在几个基准示例上展示了我们提出的方法的有效性，包括基于感知的高维车道保持系统。",
