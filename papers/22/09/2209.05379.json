    "translated_abstract": "自闭症，也被称为自闭症谱系障碍（ASD），是一种神经性疾病。其主要症状包括(口语和/或非口语)沟通困难和僵化/重复行为。这些症状常常难以与正常（对照）个体区分，因此这种障碍在儿童早期仍然未被诊断出来，从而导致延迟治疗。由于在早期年龄段学习曲线陡峭，早期诊断自闭症可以在正确的时间采取适当的干预措施，可能对自闭症孩子的成长产生积极影响。此外，传统的自闭症诊断方法需要多次就诊于专科精神科医生，然而这一过程可能耗时。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于学习的方法，利用简单且小的被试动作视频剪辑来自动化自闭症诊断。这项任务特别具有挑战性，因为可用的注释数据量很小，并且样本之间存在变化。",
