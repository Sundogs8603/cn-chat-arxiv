    "abstract": "The quality of generalized linear models (GLMs), frequently used by insurance companies, depends on the choice of interacting variables. The search for interactions is time-consuming, especially for data sets with a large number of variables, depends much on expert judgement of actuaries, and often relies on visual performance indicators. Therefore, we present an approach to automating the process of finding interactions that should be added to GLMs to improve their predictive power. Our approach relies on neural networks and a model-specific interaction detection method, which is computationally faster than the traditionally used methods like Friedman H-Statistic or SHAP values. In numerical studies, we provide the results of our approach on artificially generated data as well as open-source data.",

    "translated_abstract": "广义线性模型（GLMs）是保险公司经常使用的建模方法，其质量取决于交互变量的选择。寻找交互作用对于具有许多变量的数据集来说非常耗时，很大程度上依赖于精算师的专业判断，通常依赖于视觉性能指标。因此，本文提出了一种自动化寻找GLMs中应添加的交互作用以提高其预测能力的方法。我们的方法依赖于神经网络和模型特定的交互检测方法，这比传统方法（如Friedman H统计量或SHAP值）要快。在数字研究中，我们提供了我们的方法在人工生成数据以及开源数据上的结果。",
