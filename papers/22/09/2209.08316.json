    "abstract": "In this work, we present a new dataset and a computational strategy for a digital coach that aims to guide users in practicing the protocols of self-attachment therapy. Our framework augments a rule-based conversational agent with a deep-learning classifier for identifying the underlying emotion in a user's text response, as well as a deep-learning assisted retrieval method for producing novel, fluent and empathetic utterances. We also craft a set of human-like personas that users can choose to interact with. Our goal is to achieve a high level of engagement during virtual therapy sessions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in a non-clinical trial with N=16 participants, all of whom have had at least four interactions with the agent over the course of five days. We find that our platform is consistently rated higher for empathy, user engagement and usefulness than the simple rule-based framework. Finally, we provide guidelines to further improve the design and performance ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个用于指导用户进行自述疗法的数字辅导系统的新数据集和计算策略。我们的框架通过将基于规则的对话代理与深度学习分类器相结合，可以识别用户文本回复中的潜在情绪，并采用深度学习辅助检索方法生成新颖、流畅和共情的话语。我们还设计了一组类似人类的角色供用户选择互动。我们的目标是在虚拟疗法会话中实现高水平的参与度。我们在一项非临床试验中对N=16名参与者进行了框架的有效性评估，这些参与者在五天内至少与代理进行了四次互动。结果显示，与简单的基于规则的框架相比，我们的平台在共情度、用户参与度和实用性方面被评价得更高。最后，我们提供了进一步改进设计和性能的指导方针。",
