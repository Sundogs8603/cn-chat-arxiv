    "translated_abstract": "目标: 在生物医学信号处理中，寻找感兴趣的事件是一项常见任务。癫痫发作和信号伪影检测是两个关键的例子。基于时段的分类是典型的机器学习框架，用于检测这些信号事件，因为可以直接应用经典机器学习技术。通常，需要后处理才能实现良好的性能并强制时间依赖性。设计合适的后处理方案来将这些分类输出转化为事件是这一框架中费时费力的部分。方法: 我们提出了一种基于事件的建模框架，直接使用事件作为学习目标，摒弃了临时的后处理方案将模型输出转化为事件。我们通过模拟数据和真实世界数据展示了这种框架的实际效果，并将其与基于时段的建模方法进行比较。结果: 我们表明，基于事件的建模（无需后处理）具有实用性能。",
