In this type of task, modern machine learning techniques have shown to work better than classic systems since they are more adaptable to stochasticity and better able to cope with large uncertainties. More specifically, supervised and imitation learning have achieved outstanding results in this regard, with the shortcoming of requiring some form of supervision which is not always obtainable for all settings. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) requires much milder form of supervision but still remains impracticable due to its inefficiency. In this paper, we propose and theoretically motivate a novel Unsupervised Reward Shaping algorithm from expert's observations which relaxes the level of supervision required by the agent and works on improving RL performance in our task.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们针对物流领域典型的卸货问题，建立了一个顺序取货任务模型。在这类任务中，现代机器学习技术表现得比传统系统更好，因为它们更适应随机性，更能应对大量不确定性。尤其是，受监督和模仿学习在这方面取得了杰出的成果，但缺点是需要某种形式的监督，而这在所有设置中并不总是可获得的。另一方面，强化学习（RL）需要更轻微的监督，但仍然因其低效而难以应用。本文提出并在理论上证明了一种新颖的无监督奖励塑造算法，该算法利用专家的观察来减轻对代理人所需监督级别，并改善我们任务的RL性能。",
