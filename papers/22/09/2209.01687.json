    "translated_abstract": "个体概率指的是仅在一次结果中实现的结果概率，如明天下雨概率、Alice在接下来的12个月内死亡概率、Bob在接下来的18个月内因暴力犯罪被捕的概率等。个体概率本质上是不可知的。然而，我们展示了在同意数据或从数据分布中进行采样的两个当事方不能在如何建模个体概率上达成一致，因为任何两种有着实质性分歧的个体概率模型都可以一起用于实证地证明并改善其中至少一个模型。这可以高效地迭代，在\"协调\"的过程中得到双方都认同的优于初始模型的模型，并在几乎所有情况下（几乎）达成了个体概率预测的一致。我们的结论是，尽管个体概率预测本质上是不确定的，但可以通过协调间接改进。",
