    "translated_abstract": "大型多智能体系统例如实时策略游戏通常被智能体的集体行为所驱动。例如在星际争霸II中，人类玩家会将空间接近的智能体分组成团队，并控制团队击败敌人。在这种情况下，将游戏中的智能体进行聚类已被用于多智能体强化学习的高效控制以及提供给游戏用户的游戏分析工具等等多个方面。然而，尽管聚类提供了有用的信息，但是在研究多智能体系统在群集级别上的动态学习方面还很少被研究。在本文中，我们提出了一种混合型AI模型，将无监督学习和自监督学习相结合，来预测星际争霸II中群集的演化。我们开发了一种无监督的 Hebbian 学习方法，用于在 Set-to-Cluster 模块中高效地创建可变数量的群集，其推理时间复杂度低于 K-means 聚类。同时，采用了基于长短期记忆（LSTM）的预测模型学习群集的复杂动态，并预测未来群集的归属。通过实验结果，我们证明了所提出的方法优于现有的聚类方法，并能够在游戏的多个场景下准确预测群集演化。",
