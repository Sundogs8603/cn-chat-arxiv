    "translated_abstract": "在数据同化中，将非结构化数据纳入物理模型是一个具有挑战性的问题。传统方法通常关注具有明确定义观测算子的情况，其函数形式通常被假定为已知。这阻止了这些方法在从数据空间到模型空间的映射未知的配置中实现一致的模型与数据综合。为了解决这些问题，在本文中我们开发了一种物理指导的动态变分自编码器($\\Phi$-DVAE)，将多样化的数据流嵌入到由微分方程描述的时变物理系统中。我们的方法结合了一个标准的、可能是非线性的潜在状态空间模型滤波器和一个变分自编码器，将非结构化数据同化到潜在的动态系统中。在我们的示例系统中，非结构化数据采用视频数据和速度场测量的形式，但该方法的适用性足够通用，可以允许任意未知的观测算子。",
