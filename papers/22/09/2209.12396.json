    "translated_abstract": "公平聚类旨在将数据划分为不同的簇，同时防止敏感属性（例如性别、种族、RNA测序技术）在聚类中占主导地位。尽管最近进行了许多工作并取得了巨大成功，但大多数都是启发式的，缺乏统一的算法设计理论。本文通过发展深度公平聚类的互信息理论，并设计了一个新的算法FCMI，填补了这一空白。简而言之，通过最大化和最小化互信息，FCMI旨在实现深度公平聚类高度期望的四个特征，即紧凑、平衡和公平的聚类，以及具有信息量的特征。除了对理论和算法的贡献外，本文的另一个贡献是提出了一种建立在信息理论基础上的新的公平聚类度量标准。与现有的评估指标不同，我们的度量标准衡量聚类质量...",
