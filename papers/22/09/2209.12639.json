    "abstract": "In this work, we develop an equilibrium model for price formation of securities in a market composed of two populations of different types: the first one consists of cooperative agents, while the other one consists of non-cooperative agents. The trading of every cooperative member is assumed to be coordinated by a central planner. In the large population limit, the problem for the central planner is shown to be a conditional extended mean-field control. In addition to the convexity assumptions, if the relative size of the cooperative population is small enough, then we are able to show the existence of a unique equilibrium for both the finite-agent and the mean-field models. The strong convergence to the mean-field model is also proved under the same conditions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对由两种不同类型人口组成的市场，即由合作人员和非合作人员组成的市场，开发了一个证券价格形成的均衡模型。假设中心计划者协调每个合作成员的交易。在大人口问题中，中央计划者的问题被证明是一个条件扩展的均场控制问题。除了凸性假设外，如果合作人口的相对大小足够小，则我们能够证明有限代理和均值场下存在唯一的均衡。在相同条件下还证明了强收敛到均值场模型。",
