    "translated_abstract": "线性时间逻辑（LTL）是最受欢迎的时间逻辑之一，广泛应用于计算机科学的各个领域。LTL的强大基础性质之一是其等价于无计数ω-自动机、星自由ω-正则表达式以及（通过Kamp定理）线性序的一阶理论（FO-TLO）。安全语言和协安全语言分别指只需有限前缀便可确定该单词属于或不属于该语言的语言类型。SafetyLTL（和coSafetyLTL）是LTL的一个片段，其中仅允许使用全局（存在）时间修饰词来识别安全（协安全）语言。本文的主要贡献是引入FO-TLO的片段SafetyFO以及其对偶的coSafetyFO，它们在表达能力上都是完备的（except一些边界情况）。",
