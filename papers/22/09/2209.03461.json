    "abstract": "We consider the problem of choosing a portfolio that maximizes the cumulative prospect theory (CPT) utility on an empirical distribution of asset returns. We show that while CPT utility is not a concave function of the portfolio weights, it can be expressed as a difference of two functions. The first term is the composition of a convex function with concave arguments and the second term a composition of a convex function with convex arguments. This structure allows us to derive a global lower bound, or minorant, on the CPT utility, which we can use in a minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm for maximizing CPT utility. We further show that the problem is amenable to a simple convex-concave (CC) procedure which iteratively maximizes a local approximation. Both of these methods can handle small and medium size problems, and complex (but convex) portfolio constraints. We also describe a simpler method that scales to larger problems, but handles only simple portfolio constraints.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了选择一个投资组合，以在资产回报的经验分布上最大化累积概率理论（CPT）效用的问题。我们展示了虽然CPT效用不是投资组合权重的凹函数，但它可以表示为两个函数的差值。第一个项是由凸函数和凹参数的组合函数，第二个项是由凸函数和凸参数的组合函数。这种结构使我们能够推导出CPT效用的全局下界，或次级界，我们可以在最小化-最大化（MM）算法中使用这个下界来最大化CPT效用。我们进一步展示了该问题可以通过简单的凸-凹（CC）过程来处理，该过程以迭代方式最大化局部逼近。这两种方法都可以处理小型和中型问题，以及复杂（但是凸）的投资组合约束。我们还描述了一种更简单的方法，可扩展到更大的问题，但只处理简单的投资组合约束。",

Two different algorithms are presented to solve the problem, and their capabilities for handling different portfolio constraints are discussed."
