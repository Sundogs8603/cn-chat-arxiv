    "translated_abstract": "长期以来，人们对于捕捉对象检测器错误行为的兴趣一直存在，即找到其性能可能不令人满意的图像。在诸如自动驾驶等实际应用中，对于超出简单检测性能要求的潜在故障进行表征也至关重要。例如，与自身车辆相近的行人的漏检通常需要更仔细的检查，而与车辆较远处的漏检相比较而言。在文献中，预测此类潜在故障在测试时间的问题在很大程度上被忽视了，而基于检测不确定性的传统方法则无法提供对错误的这种精细化表征。在本研究中，我们提出了将找到“困难”图像的问题重新定义为一个基于查询的困难图像检索任务，其中查询是对“困难性”的具体定义，并提供了一种简单直观的方法，可以针对大量的困难图像定义解决这个任务。",
