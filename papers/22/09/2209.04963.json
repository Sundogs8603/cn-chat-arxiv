    "translated_abstract": "负责任的AI被广泛认为是我们时代最重要的科学挑战之一，也是增加AI采用的关键。最近，许多AI伦理原则框架已经发布。然而，缺乏进一步的最佳实践指导，从业者们除了空洞的词句之外没有太多东西可依靠。此外，现有的努力更多地集中在算法层面上，而不是系统层面上，主要关注一些符合数学原则的伦理问题，如公平性。然而，伦理问题可能在开发生命周期的任何阶段出现，涉及多个AI和非AI系统组件。为了从系统角度实现负责任的AI，本文基于多声音文献综述的结果，提出了一个负责任的AI模式目录。我们的关注点不仅仅停留在原则和算法层面上，而是聚焦于AI系统利益相关者在实践中可以采取的模式，以确保",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一个负责任的AI模式目录，旨在从系统角度实现负责任的AI。与现有的伦理原则框架不同，该目录提供了实践中可采取的最佳实践，并涵盖了AI系统开发生命周期的各个阶段。",
    "en_tdlr": "In this paper, a Responsible AI Pattern Catalogue is presented, aiming to achieve responsible AI from a system perspective. Unlike existing ethics principles frameworks, this catalogue provides practical best practices that can be undertaken and covers various stages of the AI system development lifecycle."
