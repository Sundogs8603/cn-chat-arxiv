    "translated_abstract": "基于人工智能的模型的快速发展要求创新的监控技术，这些技术可以以低计算成本实时操作。在机器学习中，特别是考虑到人工神经网络（ANNs），模型通常是以监督方式进行训练的。因此，在模型部署期间，输入和输出之间学习到的关系必须保持有效。如果这个平稳性假设成立，我们可以得出结论，ANN提供准确的预测。否则，需要重新训练或重建模型。我们建议考虑由ANN生成的数据的潜在特征表示（称为“嵌入”），以确定数据流开始变得非平稳的时间。具体而言，我们通过应用基于数据深度计算和归一化排名的多元控制图来监测嵌入。我们将引入的方法与各种ANN基准方法进行了比较。",
