    "translated_abstract": "由于现实世界中多变量时间序列（MTS）的非平稳性，随着时间推移其分布会发生变化，这被称为分布漂移。大多数现有的MTS预测模型在处理分布漂移时遭受重创，并随着时间的推移而降低预测性能。现有方法通过适应最新到达的数据或根据未来数据推导的元知识自我纠正来解决分布漂移。尽管这些方法在MTS预测中取得了巨大成功，但它们很少从分布角度捕捉内在的分布变化。因此，我们提出了一个新颖的框架：时间条件变分自动编码器（TCVAE），用于在MTS中模拟历史观察值和未来数据之间的动态分布依赖关系，并将这些依赖关系推断为一个时间条件分布以利用潜在变量。具体来说，一个新颖的时间Hawkes注意力模型",
