    "translated_abstract": "由于电容层析成像（ECT）在多个工业领域的快速增长应用，迫切需要开发高质量且快速的图像重建方法来从原始电容测量中得到图像。深度学习作为一种有效的非线性映射工具，已经在包括电气层析成像在内的许多领域中广泛应用。在本文中，我们提出了一种用于从电容测量中重建ECT图像的条件生成对抗网络（CGAN）模型。该CGAN模型的初始图像是由电容测量构造的。据我们所知，这是首次将电容测量表示为图像形式。我们创建了一个包含320K个合成图像测量对的新ECT数据集进行训练，并使用测试数据集、受污染数据和流动模式来评估所提出的CGAN-ECT模型的可行性和泛化能力。",
