    "translated_abstract": "符合性检查技术允许我们评估特定过程模型的展示行为，由监测事件的跟踪表示。现代监测和活动识别技术，如传感器、物联网、统计学和人工智能等技术，可以产生大量相关事件数据。然而，该数据通常具有噪声和不确定性，与符合性检查算法所需的确定性事件日志的假设相反。本文将基于对齐的符合性检查扩展到概率事件日志。我们介绍了加权跟踪模型和加权对齐成本函数，以及自定义阈值参数，用于控制对事件数据与过程模型的置信度水平。最终的算法考虑到具有较低但足够高概率的活动，以更好地与过程模型对齐。我们从正式和非正式的角度解释了算法及其动机，并通过合成和实际案例研究验证了其效用和效率。",
