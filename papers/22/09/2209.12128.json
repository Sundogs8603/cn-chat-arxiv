    "translated_abstract": "科学家通常使用时间序列数据来研究复杂的自然过程，但回归分析常常假设过于简单化的动力学。深度学习的最近进展，在复杂过程模型的性能上取得了惊人的提高，但深度学习通常不用于科学分析。在这里，我们展示了深度学习可以用于分析复杂的过程，提供灵活的函数逼近并具有可解释性。我们的方法放松了传统简化假设（如线性、平稳和同方差性），这些假设对许多自然系统而言是不可行的，可能会严重影响数据的解释。我们在人类语言处理方面进行了模型评估，这是一个具有复杂连续动力学的领域。我们证明了在行为和神经影像数据上有显著的改进，并且我们展示了我们的模型可以在控制多种混杂实验设置的混杂因素和缺失数据的情况下，发现探索性分析中的新模式。",
