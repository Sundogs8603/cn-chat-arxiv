    "translated_abstract": "先前的研究表明，单词在能够将它们与最小对手区分的语音维度上存在超发音现象。本文提出了一个动态神经场模型，用于解释这种对比性超发音现象。该模型通过对单词的最小对手的抑制作用，来实现语音对齐时间的超发音。我们进行了一项新的实验，研究了伪单词中的失音塞辅音语音对齐时间的对比性超发音。结果显示，在伪单词中存在对比性超发音现象，说明超发音现象与实时语音计划和制作有关。与实际单词中的超发音相比，伪单词中超发音现象的范围和程度有所降低，表明词汇和音位计划层之间的交互激活在超发音上起到了作用。我们讨论了我们的模型在统一从对比性超发音到音位邻域效应和语音痕迹效应等一些明显不同的现象中的潜力。",
