    "translated_abstract": "事件检测任务可以从文本中快速检测事件，并为下游的自然语言处理任务提供有力的支持。大多数这样的方法只能检测一组固定的预定义事件类别。扩展它们以检测新类别，而不失去检测旧类别的能力，需要耗费大量成本从头开始重新训练模型。增量学习可以有效解决这个问题，但是需要大量新类别的标记数据。然而，在实践中，新事件类别缺乏高质量的标记数据，导致很难获得足够的训练数据。针对上述问题，我们定义了一个新任务即\"少样本增量事件检测\"，旨在学习仅有少量数据的新事件类别的检测，同时尽可能地保留检测旧类别的能力。我们基于FewEvent创建了IFSED基准数据集，提出了两个基准测试IFSED-K和IFSED-C以评估模型的性能。为了解决这个任务，我们提出了一个由聚类模块和知识蒸馏模块组成的新框架，用于识别新事件实例和知识传输。在基准数据集上的实验证明了我们的框架可以有效地解决少样本增量事件检测任务。",
