    "translated_abstract": "在拥挤的空间中，实时动态环境感知对于自主机器人变得至关重要。虽然流行的基于体素的建图方法可以高效地表示具有任意复杂形状的3D障碍物，但它们很难区分静态和动态障碍物，导致避障性能有限。虽然自主驾驶中存在许多复杂的基于学习的动态障碍物检测算法，但四旋翼飞行器的有限计算资源无法使用这些方法实现实时性能。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种使用RGB-D相机的四旋翼飞行器避障的实时动态障碍物跟踪和建图系统。所提出的系统首先利用带有占据体素地图的深度图像生成潜在的动态障碍物区域作为候选。然后，利用卡尔曼滤波器和我们的连续性滤波器来跟踪每个动态障碍物。最后，使用环境模型和路径规划算法提供导航和避障指导。",
