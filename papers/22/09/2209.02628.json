    "translated_abstract": "从随机数据中揭示隐藏的动态是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为随机性参与了数据的演化过程。当随机数据的轨迹在许多情况下缺失时，这个问题变得异常复杂。在这里，我们提出了一种基于弱形式Fokker-Planck（FP）方程的方法，用于在没有轨迹的情况下有效地建模随机数据的动态。该方程控制着布朗运动中密度函数的演化。我们将高斯函数的相关性作为FP方程的弱形式的测试函数，将导数转化为高斯函数，从而通过对数据的期望和来近似弱形式。通过未知项的字典表示，构建一个线性系统，然后通过回归解决，揭示数据的未知动态。因此，我们将该方法命名为弱相关回归（WCR）方法，因为它有三个关键的组成部分：弱形式，相关性，回归。",
