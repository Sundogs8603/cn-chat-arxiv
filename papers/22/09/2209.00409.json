    "abstract": "This study assesses the effect of the #MeToo movement on the language used in judicial opinions on sexual violence related cases from 51 U.S. state and federal appellate courts. The study introduces various indicators to quantify the extent to which actors in courtrooms employ language that implicitly shifts responsibility away from the perpetrator and onto the victim. One indicator measures how frequently the victim is mentioned as the grammatical subject, as research in the field of psychology suggests that victims are assigned more blame the more often they are referred to as the grammatical subject. The other two indices designed to gauge the level of victim-blaming capture the sentiment of and the context in sentences referencing the victim and/or perpetrator. Additionally, judicial opinions are transformed into bag-of-words and tf-idf vectors to facilitate the examination of the evolution of language over time.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究评估了#MeToo运动对51个美国州和联邦上诉法院关于性暴力相关案件的司法意见中使用的语言的影响。该研究引入了各种指标来量化法庭中的参与者使用的语言，这种语言暗示性地将责任转嫁给受害者。其中一个指标衡量了作为语法主语提及受害者的频率，因为心理学领域的研究表明，受害者被作为语法主语提及的次数越多，受到的责怪就越多。另外两个衡量受害者指责程度的指数捕捉了句子中涉及受害者和/或施害者的情感和上下文。此外，司法意见被转化为词袋和tf-idf向量，以便研究语言随时间的演变。通过D因果效应估算了#MeToo运动的因果影响。",
