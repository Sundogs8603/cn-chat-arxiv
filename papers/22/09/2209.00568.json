    "translated_abstract": "事件时间关系抽取（ETRE）是一个关键但具有挑战性的问题。事件对位于不同距离的话语中，我们称之为接近性带。关于位于更远（即“长”）或更近（即“短”）接近性带的事件对的时间顺序传达方式不同。目前ETRE模型往往在位于短或长接近性带的事件上表现良好，但不能同时表现良好。然而，现实世界中的自然文本包含所有类型的时间事件对。在本文中，我们提出了MulCo：多尺度对比知识共同蒸馏，这是一种融合方法，可以跨多个事件对接近性带共享知识，以提高对所有类型时间数据集的性能。我们的实验结果表明MulCo成功地整合了跨短和长接近性带的与时间推理相关的语言线索。",
