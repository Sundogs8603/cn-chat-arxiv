    "translated_abstract": "会议在许多行业中很普遍，但它们如何有效地传播想法一直存在争议，传播机制也不清楚。会议参与者可以从他们选择观看（直接影响）或偶然看到（意外影响）的演讲中采纳想法。本文通过利用准随机调度冲突量化学术会议演讲直接和意外对未来引用的影响。当参会者同时有兴趣的多篇论文同一时间演讲时，平均来说，该人将无法全部观看，如果演讲很重要，则会较少引用相关论文。我们使用 Confer 数据，它是一款部署在 25 个现场计算机科学会议中的调度应用程序，允许用户喜欢论文并接收个性化日程安排。相比于有许多冲突的时间段，用户在无调度冲突的时间段中引用喜欢的论文增加了52％。用户在没有冲突的会话中也引用非喜欢的论文增加了51％，这是一种意外的扩散现象。",
    "tldr": "研究利用 Confer 数据分析了学术会议演讲直接和意外对未来引用的影响，结果发现与有冲突的时间段相比，无冲突时间段中用户引用的论文数量明显增加。"
