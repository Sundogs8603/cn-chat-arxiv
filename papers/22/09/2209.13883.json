    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界的机器学习中，模型推理的成本效益对于时延敏感的任务和资源受限设备至关重要。一个典型的困境是：为了提供复杂的智能服务（如智能城市），我们需要多个机器学习模型的推理结果，但成本预算（如GPU内存）不足以运行所有模型。在这项工作中，我们研究了不同黑盒机器学习模型之间的基础关系，并提出了一种新的学习任务：模型链接，旨在通过学习它们输出空间之间的映射（称为模型链接）来连接不同黑盒模型的知识。我们提出了支持链接异构黑盒机器学习模型的模型链接设计。此外，为了解决分布差异挑战，我们提出了模型链接的适应和聚合方法。基于我们提出的模型链接，我们开发了一个调度算法，名为MLink。通过启用协作多模型推理，我们的算法在多个实验数据集上实现了高效的推理结果。",

The algorithm achieves efficient inference results on multiple experimental datasets."
