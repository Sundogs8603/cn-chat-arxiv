    "translated_abstract": "在制造重型工业设备的过程中，需要进行焊接图中的特定图形单元重新绘制，然后才能切割相应的钣金零部件，这种方法效率低下。为此，本文提出了一种基于U-net的方法，用于焊接工程图的特定图形单元的分割和提取。该方法可以根据视觉信息自动分割特定图形单元，并根据分割结果自动切割出相应形状的钣金零件。这个过程比传统的人工辅助切割更有效率。在U-net网络中存在两个弱点，会导致分割性能降低：首先，对全局语义特征信息的关注不够，其次，浅层编码器特征和深层解码器特征之间存在大的尺度差异。基于CBAM（卷积块注意力模块）注意机制，本文提出了一种用于钣金工程图像分割的U-net方法，解决了这些弱点。所提出的方法提高了分割性能，并在实验中使用的数据集上实现了98.97％的准确率。",
