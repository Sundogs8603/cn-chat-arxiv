    "translated_abstract": "学习优化是快速发展的一个领域，旨在使用机器学习（ML）解决优化问题或改进现有的优化算法。图神经网络（GNN）被认为是适用于具有置换不变性的优化问题的合适ML模型，例如线性规划（LP）。尽管文献报道了令人鼓舞的数值结果，但本文确立了将GNN应用于解决LP的理论基础。我们构建了一个GNN，将不同的LP映射到不同的输出，针对任何LP的大小限制。我们展示了适当构建的GNN可以可靠地预测广泛类别中每个LP的可行性，有界性和最优解。我们的证明基于最近发现的Weisfeiler--Lehman同构测试和GNN之间的联系。为了验证我们的结果，我们训练了一个简单的GNN，并展示了它在将LP映射到可行性和解决方案方面的准确性。",
