However, conducting experiments to estimate mechanical properties in MAM processes can be laborious and expensive, and they are often limited to specific materials and processes. Machine learning (ML) methods offer a more flexible and cost-effective approach to predicting mechanical properties based on processing parameters and material properties. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive framework for benchmarking ML models for predicting mechanical properties. We compiled an extensive experimental dataset from over 90 MAM articles and data sheets from a diverse range of sources, encompassing 140 different MAM data sheets. This dataset includes information on MAM processing conditions, machines, materials, and resulting mech",
