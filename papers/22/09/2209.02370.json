    "translated_abstract": "根据神经科学中的补充学习系统（CLS）理论，人类通过两个互补系统有效地进行持续学习：一个以海马体为中心的快速学习系统，用于快速学习具体的个体经验；一个位于新皮质的慢速学习系统，用于逐渐获取关于环境的结构化知识。受到这一理论的启发，我们提出了DualNets（双网络），这是一个通用的持续学习框架，由一个快速学习系统和一个慢速学习系统组成，通过自监督学习（SSL）从特定任务中进行模式分离表示的监督学习和从任务无关的一般表示的表示学习。DualNets可以无缝地将这两种表示类型合并到一个整体框架中，以促进深度神经网络的更好持续学习。通过大量实验，我们展示了有希望的结果。",
