    "translated_abstract": "标注大量电子病历的工作量大且费时，拥有一个标注助手工具可以显著减轻医疗专家的工作量，但为了赢得专家的信任，该工具必须能够解释其结果背后的原因。本文介绍了一种新的解释性标注助手工具XLabel，该工具利用可解释性提升机（EBM）对每个数据点的标签进行分类，并可视化EBM解释的热图。我们使用XLabel作为案例研究，帮助医疗专家标记了四种常见的非传染性疾病(NCDs)的电子病历。实验结果表明：1）XLabel有助于减少标注操作的次数；2）作为一种可解释的分类器，EBM的准确性与其他知名的机器学习模型相当，优于NCD专家使用的基于规则的模型；3）即使超过40%的记录被有意误标，EBM仍能保持较高的准确性。",
