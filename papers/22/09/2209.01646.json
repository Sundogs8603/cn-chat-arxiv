Firstly, we decrease the distance of span representations with the same label while increasing it for different ones via span-based contrastive learning, which relieves the ambiguity among entities and improves the robustness of the model over unlabeled entities. Then we propose retrieval augmented inference to mitigate the decision boundary shifting problem.

    "translated_abstract": "命名实体识别是定位和分类文本中实体的任务。然而，NER数据集中的无标签实体问题严重阻碍了NER性能的提升。本文提出了SCL-RAI来解决这个问题。首先，我们通过基于跨度的对比学习减小了具有相同标签的跨度表示之间的距离，同时增加了具有不同标签的跨度表示之间的距离，从而缓解了实体之间的歧义，并提高了模型对无标签实体的鲁棒性。然后，我们提出了检索增强推理来减轻决策边界偏移的问题。我们的方法在两个真实世界数据集上的F1分数分别比之前的SOTA方法提高了4.21%和8.64%。",
    "tldr": "SCL-RAI是一种应对命名实体识别中无标签实体问题的方法。它利用跨度对比学习减小了同类跨度之间的距离、增大了不同类跨度之间的距离，从而提高了对无标签实体的识别准确性。此外，通过检索增强推理，还解决了决策边界偏移问题。实验证明，该方法在真实世界数据集上明显优于之前的方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "SCL-RAI is a method to address the problem of unlabeled entities in named entity recognition. It utilizes span-based contrastive learning to reduce the distance between spans with the same label and increase the distance between spans with different labels, improving the accuracy of recognizing unlabeled entities. Additionally, retrieval augmented inference is employed to mitigate the issue of decision boundary shifting. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms previous approaches on real-world datasets."
