    "translated_abstract": "最近，对比学习(Contrastive learning, CL)在提高推荐系统性能方面扮演着重要角色。基于CL的推荐模型的原理是: 确保从用户-物品二分图的不同图形增强中派生的表示一致性。这种自监督方法可以从原始数据中提取通用特征，减轻数据稀疏性的问题。尽管这种方法很有效，但是其性能提升的因素尚未被完全理解。本文提出了对CL对推荐的影响的新见解。我们的发现表明，CL使模型学习到更均匀分布的用户和物品表示，从而减轻了盛行的流行度偏见，促进了长尾物品的发现。我们的分析还表明，之前认为必不可少的图形增强在基于CL的推荐中相对不可靠且影响有限。",
