    "translated_abstract": "异常检测在计算机视觉领域最近引起了越来越多的关注，可能是因为它具有广泛的应用范围，包括工业生产线上的产品故障检测、视频监控中即将发生的事件检测以及医学扫描中的病变检测等。无论是哪个领域，异常检测通常被看作是一个单类别分类任务，其中学习仅在正常示例上进行。成功的异常检测方法家族基于学习重构遮蔽的正常输入（例如补丁、未来帧等），并将重构误差的大小作为异常程度的指示器。与其他基于重构的方法不同，我们提出了一种新颖的自监督遮蔽卷积变压器块 (SSMCTB)，该块在核心架构层面上包含了基于重构的功能。所提出的自监督块非常灵活，可以在不同层面进行信息遮蔽。",
