    "translated_abstract": "在去中心化交易所上进行交易已成为使用无需许可的区块链的主要用例之一，每日的交易量超过数十亿美元。目前，用户广播交易，而矿工负责组成包含这些交易的块并选择一个执行顺序——即交易在交易所中执行的顺序。由于缺乏监管框架，很常见看到矿工利用其特权地位在前置交易和获得无风险利润。在本文中，我们提出了修改矿工和用户之间互动的建议，并开始研究“可验证排序规则”。像现状一样，矿工可以确定块的内容；然而，它们承诺遵守一个限制执行顺序的排序规则，并且该规则是可验证的（存在一种多项式时间算法可以验证执行顺序是否满足此类约束）。因此，如果矿工偏离排序规则，那么所有交易都将降级为无效状态。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出可验证排序规则，为去中心化交易所提供了更可靠的交易执行方式，并对于现有矿工操纵市场的问题提供了解决方案。"
