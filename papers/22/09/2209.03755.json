    "translated_abstract": "误导和虚假信息对我们的安全和稳定构成了严重的全球威胁。为了应对在线虚假信息规模的挑战，研究人员一直在努力通过检索和验证相关证据来自动进行事实核查。然而，尽管有许多进展，但对此类系统可能面临的攻击向量的全面评估仍然缺乏。本研究假设存在一个敌对方，通过伪装相关证据或者提供具有误导性的信息，自动干扰在线证据，以破坏事实验证模型。我们首先提出一个分类法，涵盖这两个目标和不同的威胁模型维度。基于此，我们设计并提出了几种可能的攻击方法。我们展示了在多种情况下，可以对证据中与事实相关的部分进行微小的修改，并生成与原始证据脱节的虚假信息，从而破坏事实验证结果，使其无法被自动识别。",
