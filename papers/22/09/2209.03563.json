    "translated_abstract": "近年来，自监督学习（SSL）取得了巨大的成功，在计算机视觉（CV）和自然语言处理（NLP）领域被广泛用于促进各种下游任务。然而，攻击者可能窃取这些SSL模型并将其商业化，因此验证SSL模型的所有权变得至关重要。现有的大多数所有权保护解决方案（例如基于后门的水印）都是为监督学习模型设计的，不能直接使用，因为它们要求在嵌入水印时已知和可用的是模型的下游任务和目标标签，在SSL领域中这并不总是可能的。为了解决这个问题，特别是在嵌入水印期间下游任务多样且不知道的情况下，我们提出了一种名为SSL-WM的新型黑盒水印解决方案，用于验证SSL模型的所有权。SSL-WM将受保护的编码器的带水印输入映射到不变表示s中。",
