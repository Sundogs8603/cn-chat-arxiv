    "translated_abstract": "近年来，机器学习（ML）研究人员一直在定义和改进机器学习基准和数据集。与此同时，一些人在关注数据集创建和ML研究的伦理道德。在本文中，我们强调了伦理和看似“技术”或“科学”决策在ML基准设计中的纠缠。我们的出发点是人类智力基准和ML基准之间存在多重被忽视的结构相似性。这两种基准都设定了用于描述、评估和比较智力相关任务表现的标准，许多人类智力学者长期以来已经认识到这些标准是价值观负载的。我们利用女性主义科学哲学和社会科学中的厚概念视角来 论证，在创建ML基准时需要考虑和记录价值观。通过创建关于数据集本身的规范，而不是隐含的伦理，可以避免不必要的选择。",
