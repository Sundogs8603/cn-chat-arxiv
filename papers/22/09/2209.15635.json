    "abstract": "The traditional vertical federated learning schema suffers from two main issues: 1) restricted applicable scope to overlapped samples and 2) high system challenge of real-time federated serving, which limits its application to advertising systems. To this end, we advocate a new learning setting Semi-VFL (Vertical Semi-Federated Learning) to tackle these challenge. Semi-VFL is proposed to achieve a practical industry application fashion for VFL, by learning a federation-aware local model which performs better than single-party models and meanwhile maintain the convenience of local-serving. For this purpose, we propose the carefully designed Joint Privileged Learning framework (JPL) to i) alleviate the absence of the passive party's feature and ii) adapt to the whole sample space. Specifically, we build an inference-efficient single-party student model applicable to the whole sample space and meanwhile maintain the advantage of the federated feature extension.

    "translated_abstract": "传统的垂直联合学习架构存在两个主要问题：1）适用范围受限于重叠样本；2）实时联合服务的系统挑战较高，这限制了其在广告系统中的应用。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的学习设置——半垂直联合学习(Semi-VFL)，以应对这些挑战。半垂直联合学习旨在实现垂直联合学习的实际工业应用方式，通过学习一个联合感知的局部模型，该模型表现优于单方模型，同时保持了局部服务的便利性。为此，我们提出了精心设计的联合特权学习框架(JPL)，来解决被动方特征缺失和适应整个样本空间这两个问题。具体而言，我们构建了一个推理高效的适用于整个样本空间的单方学生模型，同时保持了联合特征扩展的优势。新的表示蒸馏",
