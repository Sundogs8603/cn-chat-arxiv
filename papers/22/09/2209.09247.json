    "translated_abstract": "去除噪音在成像和声学方面有广泛的应用。在日常应用中，去噪可能甚至包含与真实情况不符的生成方面。但是，在科学应用中，去噪必须准确地再现真实情况。本文展示了如何通过深度卷积神经网络对数据进行去噪，以使衰弱的信号出现具有量化准确性的情况。特别是，我们研究了晶体材料的X射线衍射。我们证明了在去噪数据中，源自电荷排序的微弱信号，在噪音数据中不显著，但在去噪后变得清晰而准确可见。这种成功得益于使用所测量的低噪声数据和高噪声数据的成对进行深度神经网络的监督训练。这样，神经网络就可以学习噪声的统计特性。我们证明，使用人工噪声无法得到如此量化准确的结果。因此，我们的方法阐明了通过深度神经网络去噪提取噪音数据中的衰减信号的实用策略。",
