In this paper, we introduce the paradigm of super reinforcement learning that takes advantage of Human-AI interaction for data driven sequential decision making.

    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能在社会中的普及，有效地整合人类和人工智能系统，发挥各自的优势并减少风险已成为一个重要的优先事项。在本文中，我们介绍了利用人工智能与人类互动的超级强化学习范式，用于数据驱动的顺序决策。该方法利用观察到的行为（来自人工智能或人类）作为决策者（人类或人工智能）策略学习的更强大的神谕输入。在存在未测量混杂的决策过程中，过去代理的行为可以提供有关未披露信息的宝贵见解。通过以一种新颖和合法的方式将这些信息包括在策略搜索中，所提出的超级强化学习将产生一个管保能在标准最优策略和行为策略（例如过去代理的行为）之上表现更好的超级策略。我们将这个更强大的神谕称为来自人工智能与人类互动的福音。",

By incorporating the actions of past agents in a legitimate manner, this approach yields a super-policy that outperforms both the standard optimal policy and the behavior policy in environments with unmeasured confounding. It is referred to as a blessing from the interaction between humans and AI."
