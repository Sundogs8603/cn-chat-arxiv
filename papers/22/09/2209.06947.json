    "translated_abstract": "自动化的疟疾诊断对于机器学习（ML）而言是一个困难但高价值的目标，有效的算法可以挽救许多儿童的生命。然而，当前的ML研究大多忽视了关键的用例约束，因此在临床上没有实用性。两个特别关键的因素有助于开发适用于临床现场环境的算法：（i）对ML解决方案必须满足的临床需求有清晰的理解；（ii）用于指导和评估ML模型的任务相关度量标准。忽视这些因素严重阻碍了过去在疟疾上的ML工作，因为由此产生的算法与临床需求不符。在本文中，我们在基于Giemsa染色血液薄膜的自动化疟疾诊断的背景下解决了这两个问题。首先，我们描述了为什么专业知识对于有效应用ML于疟疾诊断至关重要，并列举了提供该领域知识的技术文档和其他资源。其次，我们详细介绍了所需的度量标准以指导和评估ML模型。",
