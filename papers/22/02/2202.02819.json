    "translated_abstract": "基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的深度伪造检测方法已经证明具有很高的准确性。然而，当面对未知的伪造方法和常见的转换（如调整大小和模糊）时，这些方法往往会遇到性能下降的问题，导致训练和测试领域之间存在偏差。这种现象称为过拟合，是一个重要的挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的块洗牌正则化方法。首先，我们的方法通过将图像划分为块并应用块内和块间洗牌技术，间接实现了不同维度之间的权重共享。其次，我们引入了对抗性损失算法来减轻洗牌噪声引起的过拟合问题。最后，我们恢复块的空间布局，以捕捉它们之间的语义关联。大量实验证实了我们提出的方法的有效性。",
