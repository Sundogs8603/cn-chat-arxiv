    "abstract": "With the increasingly broad deployment of federated learning (FL) systems in the real world, it is critical but challenging to ensure fairness in FL, i.e. reasonably satisfactory performances for each of the numerous diverse clients. In this work, we introduce and study a new fairness notion in FL, called proportional fairness (PF), which is based on the relative change of each client's performance. From its connection with the bargaining games, we propose PropFair, a novel and easy-to-implement algorithm for finding proportionally fair solutions in FL and study its convergence properties. Through extensive experiments on vision and language datasets, we demonstrate that PropFair can approximately find PF solutions, and it achieves a good balance between the average performances of all clients and of the worst 10% clients.

    "translated_abstract": "随着联邦学习系统在现实世界中越来越广泛地部署，保证公平性变得至关重要但也面临着挑战，即需要为众多不同的客户端提供合理满意的表现。在本文中，我们引入并研究了联邦学习中一种新的公平性概念，即比例公平性 (PF)，它基于每个客户端性能的相对变化。通过与交易博弈的联系，我们提出了 PropFair，一种新颖且易于实现的算法，用于在联邦学习中寻找比例公平解，并研究了其收敛性质。通过对视觉和语言数据集的广泛实验，我们证明 PropFair 能够大致找到 PF 解，并在所有客户端的平均性能和最差 10% 客户端的平均性能之间实现良好的平衡。我们的代码可在 \\url{https://github.com/huawei-noah/Federated-Learning/tree/main/FairFL} 找到。",
