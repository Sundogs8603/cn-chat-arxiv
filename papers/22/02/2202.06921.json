    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个框架，其中代理人被限制使用简单模型来预测经济变量，并描述了由此产生的偏见。它考虑了只能使用不超过$d$个状态的状态空间模型的代理人，其中$d$衡量了模型的时间复杂性。代理人有有限的理性，只能考虑那些过于简单而无法嵌套真实过程的模型，然后选择其中最好的模型。我表明使用简单模型会增加前瞻决策的持久性和它们之间的共同行动。然后我解释了如何利用这一观点将三个主流宏观经济模型的预测接近于数据。在新凯恩斯模型中，前瞻指导的效力降低。在真实商业周期模型中，消费对生产力冲击的反应变得更加迟缓。Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides模型在对生产力的响应中表现出更多的内部传播和更真实的共同行动。",
