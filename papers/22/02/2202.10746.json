    "translated_abstract": "通过POD-Galerkin方法进行模型阶数约简可以极大地提高求解物理问题的计算效率。然而，该方法在处理非线性高维动力系统如Navier-Stokes方程方面的适用性受到限制，产生不准确且有时不稳定的模型。本文提出了一种基于深度学习的闭合建模方法，用于经典的POD-Galerkin降阶模型(ROM)。所提出的方法在理论上是有基础的，使用神经网络来逼近研究得当的运算符。与大多数以前的工作相比，本文中的CD-ROM方法是基于可解释的连续记忆形式，由关于部分观测到的动力系统行为的简单假设导出。因此，修正后的模型可以使用大多数经典的时间步进模式进行模拟。CD-ROM方法的能力在计算流体力学的两个经典案例中得到了证明，表明它可以显著提高降阶模型的准确性和稳定性。",
