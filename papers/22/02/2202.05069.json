    "abstract": "With the development of new sensors and monitoring devices, more sources of data become available to be used as inputs for machine learning models. These can on the one hand help to improve the accuracy of a model. On the other hand however, combining these new inputs with historical data remains a challenge that has not yet been studied in enough detail. In this work, we propose a transfer-learning algorithm that combines the new and the historical data, that is especially beneficial when the new data is scarce. We focus the approach on the linear regression case, which allows us to conduct a rigorous theoretical study on the benefits of the approach. We show that our approach is robust against negative transfer-learning, and we confirm this result empirically with real and simulated data.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着新传感器和监测设备的发展，越来越多的数据源可以作为机器学习模型的输入。这些数据既可以帮助提高模型的准确性，但将这些新输入与历史数据相结合仍然是一个尚未详细研究的挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种迁移学习算法，将新数据和历史数据结合起来，特别在新数据稀缺的情况下具有益处。我们将重点放在线性回归情况下，这使得我们能够对该方法的益处进行严格的理论研究。我们表明我们的方法对负迁移学习是具有鲁棒性的，并通过真实和模拟数据进行了实证验证。",
