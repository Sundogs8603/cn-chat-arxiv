    "translated_abstract": "在打破平局设计（TBD）中，具有一定高值的运行变量的受试者接受某种（通常是理想的）治疗，低值的受试者不接受治疗，而中间的受试者被随机分配。 TBD介于回归断点设计（RDD）和随机对照试验（RCT）之间，通过允许在RDD的资源分配效率与RCT的统计效率之间进行权衡。 我们研究了一个模型，其中被治疗受试者的预期反应是一个多元回归，而对照受试者则是另一个。 对于给定的协变量，我们展示了如何使用凸优化来选择优化D-最优准则的治疗概率。 我们可以结合多种受经济和伦理考虑激发的约束条件。 在我们的模型中，对于治疗效应的D-最优性与整体回归的D-最优性重合，在没有经济约束的情况下，RCT即为最优选择。",
