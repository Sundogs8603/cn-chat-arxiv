To circumvent this difficulty, we propose to employ the conditional selective inference framework, which enables us to derive a valid inference method on the DTW distance.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究考虑了在不确定环境下基于动态时间规整（DTW）算法的两个时间序列之间的相似性/距离的统计推断问题，提出了一种统计假设检验方法。由于DTW距离是基于DTW算法的解得到的，其采样分布很难计算。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了条件选择推断框架，能够推导出一种对DTW距离进行有效推断的方法。据我们所知，这是第一种能够提供有效p值来量化DTW距离的统计显著性的方法，对于像异常时间序列检测等高风险决策非常有帮助。我们在合成和真实数据集上评估了所提出的推断方法的性能。",
