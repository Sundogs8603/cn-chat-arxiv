    "abstract": "The British landscape painter John Constable is considered foundational for the Realist movement in 19th-century European painting. Constable's painted skies, in particular, were seen as remarkably accurate by his contemporaries, an impression shared by many viewers today. Yet, assessing the accuracy of realist paintings like Constable's is subjective or intuitive, even for professional art historians, making it difficult to say with certainty what set Constable's skies apart from those of his contemporaries. Our goal is to contribute to a more objective understanding of Constable's realism. We propose a new machine-learning-based paradigm for studying pictorial realism in an explainable way. Our framework assesses realism by measuring the similarity between clouds painted by artists noted for their skies, like Constable, and photographs of clouds. The experimental results of cloud classification show that Constable approximates more consistently than his contemporaries the formal feat",

    "translated_abstract": "英国山水画家约翰·康斯特布尔被认为是19世纪欧洲绘画现实主义运动的奠基人。康斯特布尔的绘制的天空，尤其是他的同时代认为非常准确，现在许多观众也有相同的感受。然而，评估类似康斯特布尔这样的写实画作的准确性是主观或直觉的，即使对于专业艺术史学家来说也很困难，难以确定康斯特布尔的天空与他的同时代有什么不同之处。我们的目标是为康斯特布尔的写实主义提供更客观的理解。我们提出了一种新的基于机器学习的图画现实主义研究范式，以可解释的方式进行评估。我们的框架通过测量像康斯特布尔这样以天空闻名的艺术家绘制的云和云的照片之间的相似度来评估写实主义。云分类的实验结果表明，康斯特布尔比他的同时代更加一致地呈现形式上的特征。",
