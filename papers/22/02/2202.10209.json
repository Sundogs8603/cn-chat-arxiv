    "translated_abstract": "最近，研究了差分隐私图神经网络(Differentially private GNNs)来在图数据上提供高准确性同时强力保护用户隐私。特别地，最近的一项研究提出了一种算法，用局部差分隐私(LDP)保护有属性的图中每个用户的特征向量，而局部差分隐私是一种强隐私概念，不需要可信第三方。然而，该算法不保护社交图中的边（友谊），因此无法保护无属性图中的用户隐私。如何在无属性图中提供高准确性的强隐私保护仍然是一个开放问题。本文提出了一种新颖的LDP算法，名为DPRR（Degree-Preserving Randomized Response），用于在GNN中提供边的LDP。我们的DPRR在提供边的LDP的同时保留了每个用户的度数，从而保持了图结构。从技术上讲，我们的DPRR使用了Warner的RR（Randomized Response）和策略性边采样，其中每个用户的采样概率是通过Lapla进行自动调整的。",
