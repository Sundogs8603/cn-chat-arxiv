However, the generation of new objects builds mainly on the understanding of the hidden structure of the training dataset followed by a sampling from a multi-dimensional normal variable. In particular each sample is independent from the others and can repeatedly propose same type of objects. To cure this drawback we introduce a kernel-based measure quantization method that can produce new objects from a given target measure by approximating it as a whole and even staying away from elements already drawn from that distribution. This ensures a better diversity of the produced objects. The method is tested on classic machine learning benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习的生成算法，如生成对抗网络（GAN）和变分自编码器（VAE），在构建与训练集中相似的对象时展现出令人印象深刻的结果。然而，生成新对象主要依赖于对训练数据集的隐藏结构的理解，然后从多维正态变量中进行采样。尤其是，每个样本都是独立的，可能会重复提出相同类型的对象。为了解决这个缺点，我们介绍了一种基于核测度量化的方法，该方法可以通过将给定目标测度近似为整体来生成新对象，并且能够避免从该分布中已经绘制的元素。这确保了生成对象的多样性。该方法在经典的机器学习基准测试上进行了测试。",
