    "abstract": "We study sequential bargaining between a proposer and a veto player. Both have single-peaked preferences, but the proposer is uncertain about the veto player's ideal point. The proposer cannot commit to future proposals. When players are patient, there can be equilibria with Coasian dynamics: the veto player's private information can largely nullify proposer's bargaining power. Our main result, however, is that under some conditions there are also equilibria in which the proposer obtains the high payoff that he would with commitment power. The driving force is that the veto player's single-peaked preferences give the proposer an option to \"leapfrog\", i.e., to secure agreement from only low-surplus types early on to credibly extract surplus from high types later. Methodologically, we exploit the connection between sequential bargaining and static mechanism design.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了提议者和否决者之间的顺序谈判。两者都具有单峰偏好，但提议者对否决者的理想点不确定。当玩家有耐心时，可以出现带有Coasian动态的均衡：否决者的私人信息可以在很大程度上抵消提议者的谈判能力。然而，我们的主要结果是，在某些条件下，也存在使提议者获得承诺权高收益的均衡。驱动力在于否决者的单峰偏好为提议者提供了一种“跨越”的选择，即提议者可以通过先从低剩余类型处获得协议以可信地从高类型处提取剩余来实现。",
