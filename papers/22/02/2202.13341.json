    "translated_abstract": "学习具有变分自编码器（VAEs）的解耦表示通常归因于损失的正则化组件。在这项工作中，我们强调数据与损失的重建项之间的相互作用是VAEs中解耦的主要贡献者。我们发现，标准的基准数据集根据典型的VAE重建损失会导致它们的主观真实因素与数据中的感知轴之间存在意外的相关性。我们的工作利用这种关系为在给定重建损失下构建对抗数据集的理论提供了基础。我们通过构建一个示例数据集验证了这一点，该数据集阻碍了最先进框架中的解耦效果，同时保持了人类直观的真实因素。最后，我们通过设计一种示例重建损失，再次能够感知到真实因素来重新实现解耦效果。我们的发现证明了解耦的主观性质。",
