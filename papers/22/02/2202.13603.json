    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了随机背景下在线广义线性回归问题，其中标签是由可能具有无界加性噪声的广义线性模型生成的。我们对经典的跟随正则化领袖（FTRL）算法进行了尖锐的分析，以应对标签噪声。具体而言，对于$\\sigma$-子高斯标签噪声，我们的分析提供了一个遗憾的上限$O(\\sigma^2 d \\log T) + o(\\log T)$，其中$d$是输入向量的维数, $T$ 是总回合数。我们还证明了随机在线线性回归的$\\Omega(\\sigma^2d\\log(T/d))$下限，这表明我们的上限几乎是最优的。此外，我们将我们的分析扩展到了更精细的伯恩斯坦噪声条件。作为一个应用，我们研究了具有异方差噪声的广义线性Bandits，提出了一种基于FTRL的算法实现第一个方差感知的遗憾上限。",
