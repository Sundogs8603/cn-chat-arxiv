    "translated_abstract": "基于场景的测试是解决配备自动驾驶系统的车辆安全行为验证挑战的一种有前途的方法。由于在真实道路交通中可以在理论上发生无限数量的具体场景，因此从安全相关行为的角度提取相关场景是成功验证和验证这些系统的关键。因此，提出了一种从自然城市道路交通数据中无监督地提取多模式城市交通场景的方法，最小化（可能有偏见的）先前专家知识的量。所提出的方法采用无监督机器学习流程，而不是通过提取具体场景到预定义功能场景的（精细的）基于规则的分配。该方法允许探索数据的未知性质及其解释为专家未能预期的测试场景。该方法在约30个小时的自然道路交通数据上进行了评估，并显示出自动识别相关测试场景的有希望的结果。",
