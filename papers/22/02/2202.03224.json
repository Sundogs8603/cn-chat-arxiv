    "translated_abstract": "开发用于预测非平稳时序数据的模型和算法是一个长期存在的统计问题。对于时尚或零售行业等许多应用来说，这是至关重要的，可以帮助做出最佳库存决策并避免巨大的浪费。本文使用最先进的计算机视觉方法，跟踪社交媒体上的数千种时尚趋势，提出了一种新的时尚时序预测模型。我们的贡献有两个。首先，我们公开提供了一个收集了10000个每周时尚时序数据的数据集。由于影响力动态是新兴趋势检测的关键，我们将每个时序数据与外部弱信号关联起来，代表影响者的行为。其次，为了利用这样的数据集，我们提出了一种新的混合预测模型。我们的方法将每个时序的参数化模型与季节性组件和一个全局递归神经网络相结合，以包括间断的外部信号。这种混合模型在提议的数据集上提供了最先进的结果。",
