    "translated_abstract": "对象为中心的表示是前向预测的重要抽象。大多数现有的前向模型通过广泛的监督学习这种表示（例如对象类别和边界框），尽管在现实中很难获得这样的真实信息。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了KINet（关键点交互网络）--一种基于关键点表示的端到端无监督框架，用于推理对象之间的相互作用。使用视觉观测，我们的模型学习将对象与关键点坐标关联起来，并发现系统的图表达，其中包括一组关键点嵌入和它们之间的关系。然后，它使用对比估计学习一个动作条件的前向模型，以预测未来的关键点状态。通过在关键点空间中学习进行物理推理，我们的模型可以自动推广到具有不同数量的对象，新颖的背景和未见过的对象几何形状的情况。实验证明了该方法的效果。",
