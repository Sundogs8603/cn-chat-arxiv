    "translated_abstract": "在复杂的环境中，如医疗保健领域，预测风险评分在指导干预方面起着越来越重要的作用。然而，直接更新用于指导干预的风险评分可能导致偏差风险估计。为了解决这个问题，我们提出使用“留置集”来进行更新-留置集是一个不接受风险评分指导干预的人群的子集。在留置集的大小上取得平衡是关键，以确保更新后的风险评分性能良好，同时最大限度地减少留置样本的数量。我们证明了这种方法使得总成本可以以$O\\left(N^{2/3}\\right)$的速度增长，其中$N$是人口规模，并且认为在一般情况下没有竞争性的替代方法。通过定义适当的损失函数，我们描述了一些条件，可以很容易地确定最佳留置集大小（OHS），并引入参数化和半参数化算法来估计OHS，并展示了其在最新风险评分中的应用。",
