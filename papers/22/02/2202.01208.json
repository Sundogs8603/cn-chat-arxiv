    "translated_abstract": "超声b模式成像是一种定性方法，诊断质量强烈依赖于操作员的培训和经验。定量方法可以提供有关组织特性的信息；因此，可以用于识别各种组织类型，例如，组织中的声速可以用作组织恶性度的生物标志物，特别是在乳腺成像中。最近的研究显示，使用完全在模拟数据上训练的深度神经网络可能实现声速重建。然而，由于模拟数据和实际数据之间的不断领域转移，这些模型在真实设置中的稳定性和性能仍然存在争议。在先前的工作中，对于培训数据生成，组织结构被建模为简化的几何结构，这不能反映真实组织的复杂性。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于层析图像的新型模拟设置用于生成培训数据。我们结合了多任务学习与分割，以整合额外的组织信息并提高重建性能。我们在幻影和体内测量上的结果表明，多样化组织结构的训练导致更稳定和健壮的模型。此外，我们提出的基于层析图像的方法在重建高分辨率声速地图方面始终优于简化的几何方法。",
