    "abstract": "Anaphoric expressions, such as pronouns and referential descriptions, are situated with respect to the linguistic context of prior turns, as well as, the immediate visual environment. However, a speaker's referential descriptions do not always uniquely identify the referent, leading to ambiguities in need of resolution through subsequent clarificational exchanges. Thus, effective Ambiguity Detection and Coreference Resolution are key to task success in Conversational AI. In this paper, we present models for these two tasks as part of the SIMMC 2.0 Challenge (Kottur et al. 2021). Specifically, we use TOD-BERT and LXMERT based models, compare them to a number of baselines and provide ablation experiments. Our results show that (1) language models are able to exploit correlations in the data to detect ambiguity; and (2) unimodal coreference resolution models can avoid the need for a vision component, through the use of smart object representations.",

    "translated_abstract": "指代表达，比如代词和指示描述，既受前文的语言语境的影响，也受到当前视觉环境的影响。然而，发言者的指示描述并不能总是唯一地确定指代物，导致需要通过后续的澄清交流来消除歧义。因此，在对话式人工智能中，有效的歧义检测和共识消解对于任务成功至关重要。本文作为SIMMC 2.0挑战的一部分，提出了这两个任务的模型。具体来说，我们使用TOD-BERT和LXMERT模型，并将它们与一些基线模型进行对比，并进行了消融实验。我们的结果表明，（1）语言模型能够利用数据中的相关性来检测歧义；（2）基于单模态的共识消解模型可以通过使用智能物体表示来避免需要视觉组件。",
