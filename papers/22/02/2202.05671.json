    "translated_abstract": "Black和Scholes（1973）的期权定价公式基于Merton（1971）的连续时间预算方程中的连续时间自融资条件，该条件是外部资金的无流入或流出的投资组合再平衡的经济概念的正式表述，但从未在连续时间下正式推导过。然而，作为更大的问题，我们发现Merton（1971）模型中的一个时间错误，并且表明他的自融资条件在离散时间和连续时间下都存在误差。我们的结果否定了该领域的杰出贡献，包括Merton（1971）的预算方程、Black和Scholes（1973）的期权定价公式、Harrison和Pliska（1981）的连续交易模型以及Cox，Ross和Rubinstein（1979）的二项期权定价模型。我们还表明，Black和Scholes（1973）以及Harrison和Pliska（1981）隐含地假定了他们的复制结果。",
