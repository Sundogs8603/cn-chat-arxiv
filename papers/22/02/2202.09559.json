    "translated_abstract": "运动想象是一种常见的脑机接口（BCI）范式。脑电图（EEG）具有非平稳性和低信噪比，将同一个参与者在不同EEG记录会话中的运动想象任务进行分类通常具有挑战性，因为EEG数据分布在不同采集会话之间可能差异巨大。虽然将跨会话运动想象分类视为域适应问题是直观的，但其原理和可行的方法尚未阐明。本文提出了一种基于数学模型的同构深度域适应（SDDA）框架，用于跨会话运动想象分类。所提出的框架可以轻松应用于大多数现有的人工神经网络，而无需改变网络结构，这使得我们的方法具有很大的灵活性和可转移性。在所提出的框架中，首先通过通道归一化和欧氏对齐共同构建了域不变性。",
