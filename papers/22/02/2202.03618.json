    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了可能具有不同质量的两个测度之间的不平衡最优输运（UOT），其中通过具有正则化因子τ的Kullback-Leibler散度放松标准最优输运（OT）的边际约束。虽然文献中只分析了基于Sinkhorn的UOT求解器，其迭代复杂度为O（τlog（n）/εlog（log（n）/ε）），每次迭代的成本为O（n^2）以达到所需的误差ε，但它们的密集输出输运计划严重阻碍了实际应用。另一方面，虽然在现代深度学习应用中被广泛用作计算UOT的启发式方法，并且在稀疏OT问题中取得了成功，但尚未对应用于UOT的梯度方法进行正式研究。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于梯度外推方法（GEM-UOT）的新算法，用于找到一个ε-近似解。",
