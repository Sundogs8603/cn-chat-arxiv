    "translated_abstract": "鉴于隐私、存储和其他限制，机器学习中越来越需要不需要访问用于训练源模型的数据的无监督域适应技术。现有的多源自由域适应（MSFDA）方法通常使用由源模型产生的伪标记数据来训练目标模型，这些方法专注于改进伪标记技术或提出新的训练目标。相反，我们的目标是分析 MSFDA 的基本限制。特别地，我们开发了一个信息论界限，来说明由此产生的目标模型的泛化误差中固有的偏差-方差平衡。然后，我们从三个角度提出如何平衡这种平衡，包括域聚合、选择性伪标记和联合特征对齐，从而导致了新算法的设计。多个数据集上的实验证实了我们的理论分析，并证明了我们提出的算法的有效性。",
