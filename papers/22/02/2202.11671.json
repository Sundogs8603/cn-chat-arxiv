    "abstract": "In the context of treatment effect estimation, this paper proposes a new methodology to recover the counterfactual distribution when there is a single (or a few) treated unit and possibly a high-dimensional number of potential controls observed in a panel structure. The methodology accommodates, albeit does not require, the number of units to be larger than the number of time periods (high-dimensional setup). As opposed to modeling only the conditional mean, we propose to model the entire conditional quantile function (CQF) without intervention and estimate it using the pre-intervention period by a l1-penalized regression. We derive non-asymptotic bounds for the estimated CQF valid uniformly over the quantiles. The bounds are explicit in terms of the number of time periods, the number of control units, the weak dependence coefficient (beta-mixing), and the tail decay of the random variables. The results allow practitioners to re-construct the entire counterfactual distribution. Moreove",

    "translated_abstract": "在治疗效应估计的背景下，本文提出了一种新的方法来恢复对立分布，当只有一个（或少数）受治疗单位和可能的高维潜在控制单位在面板结构中观察到时。该方法适用于单位数大于时间周期数（高维设置），但并不要求。与仅建模条件均值相反，我们提出了在干预之前建模整个条件分位函数（CQF）并使用l1惩罚回归在干预期间进行估计。我们导出了对估计的CQF的非渐近界限，在分位数上均匀有效。这些界限是明确的，能够通过时间周期数、控制单位数、弱依赖系数（beta混合）和随机变量的尾巴衰减来解释。这些结果使从业人员能够重新构建整个对立分布。",
