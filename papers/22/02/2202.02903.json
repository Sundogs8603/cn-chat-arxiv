    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了异质性对比的识别和估计策略，其中平行趋势假设是在对时间变量和/或时间不变协变量进行条件化后成立的。我们的第一个主要贡献是指出了常用的双向固定效应（TWFE）回归在这种情况下存在一些弱点。除了文献中强调的涉及多个时期和治疗时机变化的问题之外，我们还表明，即使在只有两个时间段的情况下，TWFE回归也不一定能够抵御（i）未接受处理的潜在结果路径取决于时间变量的水平（而不仅仅是时间内变量的变化），（ii）未接受处理的潜在结果路径取决于时间不变的协变量，以及（iii）结果随时间和/或倾向得分的线性条件违反的情况。即使在前三个问题都不成立的情况下，我们还是表明，TWFE回归可能会受到显著的效率损失。我们的第二个主要贡献是提出了一种利用局部投影得到的高维残差之间的差异的新的识别和估计策略。由于构造方式，这种新策略通常对上述所有问题都具有鲁棒性，包括结果或治疗分配规则中的潜在非线性。重要的是，我们的方法可以用现成的软件包实现，也可以用于估计存在异质性治疗效应和/或干扰的环境中的因果效应。",
