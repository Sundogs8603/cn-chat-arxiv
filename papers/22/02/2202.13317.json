    "abstract": "We investigate the attachment to the labour market of women in their 30s, who are combining career and family choices, through their reactions to an exogenous, and potentially symmetric shock, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that in Italy a large number of females with small children, living in the North, left permanent (and temporary) employment and became inactive in 2020. Despite the short period of observation after the burst of the pandemic, the identified impacts appear large and persistent, particularly with respect to the males of the same age. We argue that this evidence is ascribable to specific regional socio-cultural factors, which foreshadow a potential long-term detrimental impact on female labour force participation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究通过调查30多岁女性在职业与家庭选择上的结合，研究其对外部干扰因素（如COVID-19大流行）的反应来探讨女性对劳动力市场的依附。我们发现在意大利，许多有小孩的女性在2020年离开了长期（和临时的）职业，成为了失业人士。尽管在大流行爆发后的观察期很短，但已确定的影响似乎相当大且持久，尤其是与同龄男性相比。我们认为这种情况是由特定的地区社会文化因素造成的，这些因素预示着可能对女性劳动力参与产生长期的不利影响。",
