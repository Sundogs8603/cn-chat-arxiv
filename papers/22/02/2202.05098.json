    "translated_abstract": "自70年代提出以来，非平衡格林函数（NEGF）方法已被公认为量子输运模拟的标准方法。尽管它在模拟精度方面表现出优越性，但巨大的计算成本使其无法承受高通量模拟任务，例如敏感性分析、反向设计等。本研究提出了AD-NEGF，据我们所知是第一个端到端可微NEGF模型，用于量子输运模拟。我们使用PyTorch实现整个数值过程，并采用隐式层技术设计了自定义的反向传递，以提供可负担的梯度信息，同时保证正向模拟的正确性。所提出的模型经过应用验证，用于计算不同物理量、实验参数拟合和掺杂优化，证明了它在通过基于梯度的参数优化加速材料设计过程方面的潜力。",
