    "translated_abstract": "目前机器人学习运动技能的方法侧重于一次训练一个技能。然而，从示教中学习的机器人可以通过新增连续学习能力来学习新的运动技能，同时不会忘记过去学到的内容。为此，我们提出了一种使用超网络和神经常微分方程求解器进行持续的示教学习方法。我们通过实验验证了该方法在记住长序列轨迹学习任务方面的有效性，而无需存储来自过去示教的任何数据。实验结果表明，超网络在学习示教的最新技术方面优于其他现有的持续学习方法。我们在流行的LASA基准测试、我们在本文中引入的两个新的真实机器人基座演示数据集HelloWorld和RoboTasks上评估我们的方法，并在实际机器人上进行了演示。",
