In a regime where the gap between these means goes to zero and the number of prediction periods approaches infinity, we obtain the leading order terms of the minmax optimal regret and pseudoregret for this problem by associating each of them with a solution of a linear heat equation. Our results improve upon the previously known results; specifically, we explicitly compute these leading order terms in three different scaling regimes for the gap. Additionally, we obtain new non-asymptotic bounds for any given time horizon.",
