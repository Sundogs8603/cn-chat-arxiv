    "translated_abstract": "在生命的这一关键时期，对第一季度胎儿生长和发育进行监测，超声成像数据的分割和空间对齐至关重要。目前的方法要么是手动的，要么是半自动的，非常耗时且容易出错。为了自动化这些任务，我们提出了一个多图谱框架，利用深度学习和最小监督来实现胚胎的自动分割和空间对齐。我们的框架学习将胚胎注册到一个图谱中，该图谱由在不同孕龄范围内获取的超声图像经过分割和空间对齐后形成的。通过这个框架，我们可以得到胚胎的分割结果并将其放置在标准方向上。我们使用了8+0至12+6周的孕龄的超声图像，并选择了八个被试作为图谱。我们评估了不同的融合策略来结合多个图谱的信息。",
