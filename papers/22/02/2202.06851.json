    "translated_abstract": "人类活动理解在人工智能领域引起了广泛的关注，涉及到健康护理和行为分析等多个应用领域。尽管深度学习取得了一些进展，但仍然面临挑战。通常，像物体识别一样的解决方案试图直接将像素映射到语义，但活动模式与物体模式非常不同，从而阻碍了成功。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的范例，将任务分为两个阶段：首先将像素映射到由原子活动基元构成的中间空间，然后使用可解释的逻辑规则对检测到的基元进行编程以推断语义。为了得到一个具有代表性的基元空间，我们构建了一个包含26+M个基元标签和逻辑规则的知识库，这些规则是通过人类先验知识或自动发现得到的。我们的框架，人类活动知识引擎（HAKE），在具有挑战性的基准测试上表现出了卓越的泛化能力和性能。",
