Consequently, there is a large body of literature on characterizing the likelihood for an election to be influenced when the votes follow certain distributions, especially the likelihood of being manipulable by a single voter under the i.i.d. uniform distribution, known as the Impartial Culture (IC).  In this paper, we extend previous studies in three aspects: (1) we propose a more general semi-random model, where a distribution adversary chooses a worst-case distribution and then a contamination adversary modifies up to $\\psi$ portion of the data, (2) we consider many coalitional influence problems, including coalitional manipulation, margin of victory, and various vote controls and bribery, and (3) we consider arbitrary and variable coalition size $B$.

    "translated_abstract": "几个世纪以来，人们普遍认为小联盟选民的影响在大选中微不足道。因此，有大量文献描述了特定分布下选举可能会被影响的可能性，特别是在 i.i.d. 均匀分布下一个选民进行操纵的可能性，称为公正文化（IC）。在本文中，我们从三个方面扩展了先前的研究：（1）我们提出了一种更一般的半随机模型，其中分布对手选择最坏情况分布，然后污染对手修改高达 $ \\psi $ 数据的一部分，（2）我们考虑了许多联盟影响问题，包括联盟操纵，胜利边缘和各种选票控制和贿赂，（3）我们考虑任意和可变联盟规模 $B$。我们的主要定理提供了半随机可能性存在一组大小为 $s$ 的联盟对选举结果施加影响的紧密上下界。",
