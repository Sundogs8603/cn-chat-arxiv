    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning generative models have raised concerns as they can create highly convincing counterfeit images and videos. This poses a threat to people's integrity and can lead to social instability. To address this issue, there is a pressing need to develop new computational models that can efficiently detect forged content and alert users to potential image and video manipulations. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent studies for deepfake content detection using deep learning-based approaches. We aim to broaden the state-of-the-art research by systematically reviewing the different categories of fake content detection.
