    "translated_abstract": "图表示学习的性能受到图输入质量的影响。现有的研究通常追求全局平滑的图嵌入，然而我们认为很少观察到的异常同样对准确预测有害。本研究建立了一个图学习方案，自动检测（局部）损坏的特征属性，并为预测任务恢复鲁棒嵌入。检测操作利用图自编码器，不对本地损坏的分布做任何假设。它在一个无偏的掩码矩阵中定位异常节点属性的位置，通过稀疏促进正则化恢复鲁棒估计。优化器接近于在Framelet域中稀疏且在输入观测条件下接近的新嵌入。大量实验证明我们提出的模型能够从黑盒中恢复鲁棒的图表示并实现异常污染下的优秀预测性能。",

It utilizes a graph autoencoder for the detection operation and recovers robust estimations through sparsity promoting regularization. Experiments show that this method can recover robust graph representations under black-box attacks and achieve excellent prediction performance."
