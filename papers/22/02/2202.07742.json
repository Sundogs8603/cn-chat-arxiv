    "abstract": "Decentralized Finance (DeFi) services are moving traditional financial operations to the Internet of Value (IOV) by exploiting smart contracts, distributed ledgers, and clever heterogeneous transactions among different protocols. The exponential increase of the Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi foreshadows a bright future for automated money transfers in a plethora of services. In this short survey paper, we describe the business model for different DeFi domains - namely, Protocols for Loanable Funds (PLFs), Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), and Yield Aggregators. We claim that the current state of the literature is still unclear how to value thousands of different competitors (tokens) in DeFi. With this work, we abstract the general business model for different DeFi domains and compare them. Finally, we provide open research challenges that will involve heterogeneous domains such as economics, finance, and computer science.",

    "translated_abstract": "去中心化金融（DeFi）服务利用智能合约、分布式账本和不同协议之间的巧妙异构交易，将传统金融业务转移到了价值互联网上。DeFi中总锁定价值（TVL）的指数增长预示着未来服务中自动化资金转账的光明前景。本文简要调查了不同DeFi领域（包括贷出型资金、去中心化交易所和收益聚合器）的商业模型。我们指出，当前文献中对于如何评估DeFi中成千上万个不同竞争对手（代币）的价值仍然不清楚。通过本文，我们概括了不同DeFi领域的通用商业模型并进行了比较。最后，我们提出了涉及经济学、金融学和计算机科学等异构领域的开放性研究挑战。",
