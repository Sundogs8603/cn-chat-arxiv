    "abstract": "In this study, we develop a novel framework to assess health risks due to heat hazards across various localities (zip codes) across the state of Maryland with the help of two commonly used indicators i.e. exposure and vulnerability. Our approach quantifies each of the two aforementioned indicators by developing their corresponding feature vectors and subsequently computes indicator-specific reference vectors that signify a high risk environment by clustering the data points at the tail-end of an empirical risk spectrum. The proposed framework circumvents the information-theoretic entropy based aggregation methods whose usage varies with different views of entropy that are subjective in nature and more importantly generalizes the notion of risk-valuation using cosine similarity with unknown reference points.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究开发了一个新的框架，利用两个常用的指标即暴露度和脆弱性来评估马里兰州各地区（邮政编码）热灾害所导致的健康风险。我们的方法通过构建相应的特征向量来量化这两个指标，并利用聚类数据尾部的数据点来计算指标特定的参考向量，这些参考向量表示高风险环境。该提出的框架避免了以信息理论熵为基础的聚合方法的使用，后者的使用因熵的不同观点而变化，而这些观点在本质上是主观的，并且通过使用未知参考点的余弦相似性来推广风险评估的概念。",
