    "abstract": "The difficulty of recruiting patients is a well-known issue in clinical trials which inhibits or sometimes precludes them in practice. We interpret this issue as a non-standard version of exploration-exploitation tradeoff: here, the clinical trial would like to explore as uniformly as possible, whereas each patient prefers ``exploitation\", i.e. treatments that seem best. We study how to incentivize participation by leveraging information asymmetry between the trial and the patients. We measure statistical performance via worst-case estimation error under adversarially generated outcomes, a standard objective for clinical trials. We obtain a near-optimal solution in terms of this objective. Namely, we provide an incentive-compatible mechanism with a particular guarantee, and a nearly matching impossibility result for any incentive-compatible mechanism. Our results extend to agents with heterogeneous public and private types.",

    "translated_abstract": "招募患者的难度是临床试验中一个众所周知的问题，这在实践中抑制或有时甚至使其不可能。我们将这个问题解释为探索-开发权衡的一个非标准版本：在这里，临床试验希望尽可能均匀地进行探索，而每个患者都更喜欢“开发”，即看起来最好的治疗方法。我们研究如何通过利用试验和患者之间的信息不对称来激励参与。我们通过对抗生成的结果下的最坏估计误差来衡量统计性能，这是临床试验的标准目标。我们获得了一个在这个目标意义下近乎最优的解决方案。也就是说，我们提供了一个特定保证的激励兼容机制，并且几乎匹配任何激励兼容机制的不可能结果。我们的结果扩展到具有异质公共和私有类型的代理。",

This study provides a solution to incentivize participation by utilizing information asymmetry, addressing the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. The suggested mechanism achieves near-optimal results under worst-case estimation error and is compatible with heterogeneous agents."
