The problem is well-known to be challenging, and rich enough to encode fundamentally unstable economies, such as the roommate problem. Our approach stems from generalizing the original study of an exchange economy with unit demand and unit endowments, the \\emph{housing model}. Our first approach uses Scarf's theorem, and proposes sufficient conditions under which a ``convexify then round'' technique ensures that the core is nonempty. The upshot is that a core allocation exists in categorical economies with dichotomous preferences. Our second approach uses a generalization of the TTC: it works under general conditions, and finds a solution that is a version of the stable set.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了具有不可分割商品的交换经济中的稳定分配问题。该问题众所周知具有挑战性，并且足够丰富，可以编码根本不稳定的经济，如室友问题。我们的方法源于推广具有单位需求和单位资产的交换经济原始研究，即\\emph{住房模型}。我们的第一种方法使用了Scarf定理，并提出了确保核心非空的``凸化再舍入''技术的充分条件。重要的是，在具有二分偏好的分类经济中存在核心分配。我们的第二种方法使用了TTC的一般化：它在一般条件下工作，并找到了一个稳定集的解决方案。",

    "en_tdlr": "By generalizing the original study, we propose two methods to address stable allocations in discrete exchange economies. The first method uses Scarf's theorem to ensure a nonempty core, while the second method utilizes a generalization of TTC to find a solution related to the stable set."
