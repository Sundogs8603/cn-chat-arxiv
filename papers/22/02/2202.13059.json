    "translated_abstract": "变分推断是一种用于近似无法处理的后验分布以量化机器学习不确定性的技术。然而，单峰的高斯分布通常被选择作为参数分布，很难逼近多峰性。在本文中，我们采用高斯混合分布作为参数分布。使用高斯混合进行变分推断的一个主要难点是如何近似高斯混合的熵。我们将高斯混合的熵近似为单峰高斯的熵之和，可以通过解析计算得到。此外，我们从理论上分析了真实熵与近似熵之间的近似误差，以便揭示我们的近似何时起作用。具体而言，近似误差由高斯混合均值之间距离与方差之和的比率控制。此外，当高斯混合组件的数量趋近于无穷大时，近似误差趋近于零。",

    "en_tdlr": "The paper proposes a variational inference method using Gaussian mixture distribution as a parametric distribution, which solves the problem of multimodality by approximating the entropy of the Gaussian mixture as the sum of the entropy of the unimodal Gaussian. The approximation error is theoretically analyzed and controlled by the ratios of distances between means and the sum of variances, and converges to zero when the number of components of the Gaussian mixture approaches infinity."
