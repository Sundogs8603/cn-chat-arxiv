    "translated_abstract": "本文讨论了通过与另一个框架的纯朴集合双射的方法来找到一个论证框架的优先推理的问题。首先，我们考虑了一个论证框架是纯朴-双射的情况：其纯朴集合和优先推理相等。识别纯朴-双射的论证框架是困难的，但我们证明了在入度有限的框架中这是可行的。接下来，我们介绍了一个论证框架的优先推理与一个与其相同的论点集上的另一个框架的纯朴集合是可接受封闭的（两个可接受集合的交是可接受的）的双射。另一方面，我们证明了鉴别可接受封闭的论证框架是coNP完备的。最后，我们引入了不可简化的自卫集合的概念，这些集合不是其他集合的并集。结果发现，一个论证框架的优先推理与另一个框架的纯朴集合之间存在双射。",
