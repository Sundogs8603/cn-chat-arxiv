    "translated_abstract": "差分隐私在提供经典计算的可证安全性方面取得了非常成功的成果。最近，这个概念被推广到量子计算中。虽然经典计算本质上是无噪声的，差分隐私通常通过人为添加噪声来实现，但近期的量子计算机本来就是嘈杂的，因此自然存在差分隐私这一特性。在本文中，我们以量子散度的形式将量子差分隐私讨论在信息理论框架下。该方法的主要优势在于，差分隐私成为仅基于计算输出状态的属性，而不需要对每个测量进行检查。这导致证明更简单，性质的概括声明更广泛，并为通用噪声模型和特定噪声模型提供了若干新的限制。特别是，这些限制包括常见的表示形式。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper discusses quantum differential privacy and presents a framework for discussing it based on quantum divergence in the context of information theory. This approach simplifies proofs and generalizes the properties of differential privacy by making it a property of output states rather than requiring checks for every measurement. The framework also provides several new bounds for both general and specific noise models."
