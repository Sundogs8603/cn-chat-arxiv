Decoupling the feature space (edges) from a desired high-level explanation language (such as motifs) is thus a major challenge towards developing actionable explanations for graph classification tasks. In this paper we introduce GRAPHSHAP, a Shapley-based approach able to provide motif-based explanations for identity-aware graph classifiers, assuming no knowledge whatsoever about the model or its training data: the only requirement is that the classifier can be queried as a black-box at will.

    "translated_abstract": "大多数解释黑盒分类器的方法（例如在表格数据、图像或时间序列上）依赖于衡量删除/扰动特征对模型输出的影响。这要求解释语言与分类器的特征空间匹配。然而，在处理图数据时，基本特征对应于描述图结构的边，特征空间与解释语言之间的匹配可能不合适。为了为图分类任务开发可行的解释，将特征空间（边）与所需的高级解释语言（如模样式）解耦是一个重大挑战。在本文中，我们引入了一种基于Shapley值的方法GRAPHSHAP，能够为身份感知的图分类器提供基于模样式的解释，不需要对模型或其训练数据有任何先验知识：唯一的要求是可以任意查询黑盒分类器。",
