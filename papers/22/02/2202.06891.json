    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑针对连续设计实验进行的事后统计推断，在此实验中，多个单位在多个时间点上分配治疗，并使用随时间而适应的治疗策略。我们的目标是在对适应性治疗策略做出最少的假设的情况下，为最小可能规模的反事实均值提供推断保证，即在每个单位和每个时间下，针对不同治疗的平均结果。在没有对反事实均值进行任何结构性假设的情况下，这项具有挑战性的任务是不可行的，因为未知变量比观察到的数据点还多。为了取得进展，我们引入了一个潜在因子模型用于反事实均值上，该模型作为非参数形式的非线性混合效应模型和以前工作中考虑的双线性潜在因子模型的推广。我们使用非参数方法进行估计，即最近邻的变体，并为每个单位和每个时间的反事实均值建立了非渐进高概率误差界限。",
