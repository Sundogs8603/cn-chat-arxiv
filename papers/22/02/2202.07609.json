    "translated_abstract": "在美国的产业动态中，国家集中度的增加是一个显著特征，也引起了对市场力量增长的担忧。然而，对于市场力量情况，本地趋势可能更具信息量，特别是在零售部门，消费者通常在附近的商店购物。我们使用新型普查数据，观察了1992年至2012年间所有美国零售店产品级收入的本地集中度与国家集中度几乎同步增加。集中度的增加广泛影响大多数市场、产品和零售行业。我们发现，多市场企业进入新市场解释了国家零售集中度的大部分增长，而通过增加本地市场份额进行的整合在1997年至2007年间变得越来越重要，而单市场企业的作用微不足道。最后，我们发现本地集中度的增加可以解释整体销售增长的四分之一到三分之一。",

    "en_tdlr": "The concentration of the retail sector in the U.S. has been increasing, attributed mainly to the entry of multi-market firms into new markets. The increase in local market shares has also played a significant role between 1997 and 2007. The rise in local concentration explains one-quarter to one-third of overall sales growth."
