    "translated_abstract": "视频压缩是现代互联网的核心功能，涵盖从社交媒体到视频会议等技术。虽然视频压缩不断成熟，但在许多压缩设置中，质量损失仍然很明显。然而，这些设置对于在带宽受限或不稳定的连接上高效传输视频具有重要应用。在本文中，我们开发了一个深度学习架构，能够利用嵌入视频比特流中的底层结构和动态信息，为压缩视频恢复细节。我们展示了这种方法相比于以前的压缩校正方法提高了恢复准确性，并且在实现更高吞吐量的同时，与最近的基于深度学习的视频压缩方法在速率-失真比上具有竞争力。此外，我们在模型上进行量化数据条件化，这可轻松地从比特流中获取。这使得我们的单一模型能够处理各种不同的压缩设置。",
