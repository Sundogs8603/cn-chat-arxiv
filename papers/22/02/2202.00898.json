We show that this quantification should be distinguished from second-order quantification and meta-programming quantification. We also investigate the relationship with concepts in intensional logic.  We present an extension of first-order logic to support such abstractions, and show that it allows writing expressions of knowledge that are elaboration tolerant. To avoid nonsensical sentences in this formalism, we refine the concept of well-formed sentences, and propose a method to verify well-formedness with a complexity that is linear with the number of tokens in the formula.  We have extended FO(.), a Knowledge Representation language, and IDP-Z3, a reasoning engine for FO(.), accordingly. We show that this extension was essential in accurately modelling various problem domains in an elaboration-tolerant way, i.e., without reification.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们认为在一些知识表示应用中，我们希望对词汇中符号形式表示的概念集进行量化。我们展示了这种量化与二阶量化和元编程量化应该有所区别。我们还研究了与内涵逻辑中的概念的关系。我们提出了一个扩展的一阶逻辑来支持这样的抽象，并展示它允许编写对知识进行扩展容忍的表达式。为了避免形式主义中的无意义句子，我们改进了良式句子的概念，并提出了一种验证良式性的方法，其复杂度与公式中令牌的数量线性相关。我们相应地扩展了FO(.)，一种知识表示语言，和IDP-Z3，一种用于FO(.)的推理引擎。我们展示了这个扩展在以扩展容忍的方式（即没有实体化）准确建模各种问题领域中的重要性。",
