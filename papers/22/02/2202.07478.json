We show that the DRE solves an associated control problem, which is key to provide existence and uniqueness of a solution. As an application, we solve two algorithmic trading problems in which the agent adopts a constant absolute risk-aversion (CARA) utility function, and where the optimal strategies use signals and past observations of prices to improve their performance. First, we derive a multi-asset market making strategy in over-the-counter markets, where the market maker uses an external trading venue to hedge risk. Second, we derive an optimal trading strategy that uses prices and signals to learn the drift in the asset prices.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个具有不定矩阵系数的差分Riccati方程（DRE），该方程在一类广泛的实际问题中出现。我们表明，DRE解决了一个相关的控制问题，这对于提供解的存在性和唯一性至关重要。作为应用，我们解决了两个算法交易问题，其中代理人采用了常绝对风险厌恶（CARA）效用函数，并且最优策略使用信号和价格的历史观察来提高性能。首先，我们得出了一个多资产市场做市策略，在场外市场中，市场做市商使用外部交易场所对冲风险。其次，我们推导出一种使用价格和信号来学习资产价格漂移的最优交易策略。",
