    "translated_abstract": "我们研究设计用于选择人口部署治疗方案的实验。多臂老虎机算法可以通过根据观察到的反馈动态分配测量工作量到表现更好的臂上，从而提高效率。然而，这种动态性可能导致面对影响实验中臂表现的非平稳外生因素时出现脆弱行为。为了应对这个问题，我们提出了无偏汤普森抽样(DTS)，这是一种更稳健的著名汤普森抽样算法的变体。随着观察结果的积累，DTS会控制观察到的治疗决策的背景，同时预测一个臂的人口层级表现。这里的背景可以捕捉到一个可理解的变化源，比如一个受治疗个体的国家，或者仅仅是记录治疗时间。我们给出了DTS在实验内和实验后遗憾的界限，说明它对于外生变异的弹性。",
