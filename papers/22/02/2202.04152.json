    "translated_abstract": "多模型集成分析将多个气候模型的信息集成到一个统一的预测中。然而，现有的基于模型平均的集成方法可能会稀释细粒度的空间信息，并在重新缩放低分辨率气候模型时引入偏差。我们提出了一种统计方法，称为NN-GPR，使用具有无限宽的深度神经网络协方差函数的高斯过程回归（GPR）。NN-GPR对模型之间的关系不需要任何假设，不需要通过插值到公共网格来统一，不需要考虑平稳性假设，并且其预测算法自动进行降尺度处理。模型实验表明，NN-GPR在保留多个尺度的地理空间信号和捕捉年际变化方面在表面温度和降水预测方面可以非常熟练。我们的预测特别显示在高变异区域具有改进的准确性和不确定性量化技能，这使我们能够便宜地评估气候变化对生态系统的影响。",
