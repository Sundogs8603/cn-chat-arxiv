    "translated_abstract": "经典的马科维茨均值-方差模型使用方差作为风险度量，并使用标准优化技术计算闭合形式的前沿投资组合。对于一般的均值风险模型，这样的闭合形式的最优投资组合很难获得。本文通过在收益向量具有正态均值-方差混合分布（NMVM）的情况下，获得均值-条件价值风险（mean-CVaR）准则下的前沿投资组合的闭合形式表达式。为了达到这个目标，我们首先提出了一维NMVM模型类内随机优势的必要条件，然后将其应用于投资组合优化问题。本文的主要结果表明：当收益向量遵循NMVM分布时，相关的均值-CVaR前沿投资组合可以通过优化适当调整的收益向量的马科维茨均值-方差模型来获得。",
