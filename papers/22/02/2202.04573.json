If the dimension of the consumption space is two, then this result can be expressed by the corresponding partial equilibrium model. Our study can be seen as that extends the results in partial equilibrium theory to economies with more than two dimensional consumption space.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们展示了如果一个经济中的每个消费者都具有准线性效用函数，那么归一化后的均衡价格是唯一的，并且在对调过程中相对于局部稳定。如果消费空间的维数为二，则该结果可以用对应的局部均衡模型来表达。我们的研究可以被看作是将局部均衡理论中的结果延伸到具有超过两个维度消费空间的经济中。",
