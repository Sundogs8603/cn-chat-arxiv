Extensive experiments are conducted to give a comprehensive evaluation of the clustering performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, with various cluster shapes and low to high feature dimensionality. Our experiments demonstrate that CLASSIX competes with state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. The algorithm has linear space complexity and achieves near linear time complexity on a wide range of problems.

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种快速可解释的聚类方法，称为CLASSIX。它由两个阶段组成，即将排序后的数据聚合成附近数据点组成的群组的贪婪聚合阶段，然后将群组合并成聚类。该算法由两个标量参数控制，一个是聚合的距离参数，另一个是控制最小聚类大小的参数。我们进行了广泛的实验，对合成和真实数据集的聚类性能进行了全面评估，涵盖了各种聚类形状和低到高的特征维度。实验结果表明，CLASSIX可以与最先进的聚类算法竞争。该算法具有线性空间复杂性，在广泛的问题范围内实现了接近线性的时间复杂性。其固有的简单性使得可以生成对计算的聚类的直观解释。",
