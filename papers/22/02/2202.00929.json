    "translated_abstract": "隔夜利率（如美国的SOFR）是当前利率基准改革的核心。隔夜利率的一个显著特征是在预定日期发生跳跃和尖峰，这是由于货币政策干预和流动性限制导致的。这对应于在动态中出现随机不连续性（即在事先已知的时间点出现不连续）。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个基于隔夜利率的期限结构建模框架，并在广义的Heath-Jarrow-Morton（HJM）设置中表征无套利条件。我们拓展了传统的短期利率方法以适应随机不连续性，通过仿射半鞘马丁格尔进行可行的建模。在这个背景下，我们证明简单的规格可以捕捉到隔夜利率跃变行为的特征。在一个高斯设定下，我们提供了债券和帽式期权的显式估值公式。",
