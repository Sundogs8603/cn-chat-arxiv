    "abstract": "This paper uses a large UK cohort to investigate the impact of early-life pollution exposure on individuals' human capital and health outcomes in older age. We compare individuals who were exposed to the London smog in December 1952 whilst in utero or in infancy to those born after the smog and those born at the same time but in unaffected areas. We find that those exposed to the smog have substantially lower fluid intelligence and worse respiratory health, with some evidence of a reduction in years of schooling.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文利用大规模英国队列研究了早期污染暴露对个体的人力资本和老年健康结果的影响。我们比较了在1952年12月在胎儿期或婴儿期暴露于伦敦雾霾的个体与雾霾之后出生以及同一时间但未受影响地区出生的个体。我们发现那些暴露于雾霾的个体智力下降并且呼吸健康状况较差，同时还有一些证据表明受教育年限减少。",
