    "translated_abstract": "检测扩散生成的深度伪造图像仍然是一个尚未解决的问题。目前的检测方法无法对抗手段添加了不可察觉的对抗扰动以逃避检测的对手。在本研究中，我们提出了Disjoint Diffusion Deepfake Detection (D4)，这是一个旨在改善黑盒对抗鲁棒性的深度伪造图像检测器。D4使用一个在频谱不相交子集上的模型集合，显著提高了对抗鲁棒性。我们的关键洞察是利用频域中的冗余，并应用一个显著性分割技术将频率分量分配给多个模型。我们正式证明了这些不相交的集合导致输入子空间维度的降低，从而使黑盒攻击者更难找到对抗性的深度伪造图像。然后，我们通过实验证实了D4方法对抗多个黑盒攻击的有效性。",
