    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了当实验数据和观察数据同时存在时，长期治疗效果的识别和估计问题。由于长期结果仅在长时间延迟后才观察到，在实验数据中无法测量，但在观察数据中有记录。然而，这两种类型的数据都包含对一些短期结果的观察。在本文中，我们独特地解决了持续未测量混淆因素的挑战，即一些未测量混淆因素可以同时影响治疗、短期结果和长期结果，而这会使得之前文献中的识别策略无效。为了解决这个挑战，我们利用多个短期结果的连续结构，为平均长期治疗效果提出了三种新的识别策略。我们进一步提出了三种对应的估计器，并证明了它们的渐近一致性和渐近正态性。最后，我们将我们的方法应用于估计长期治疗效果。",
