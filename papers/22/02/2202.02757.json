Customers no longer have to visit many stores, stand in long queues, or try on garments in dressing rooms as millions of products are now available in online catalogs.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，纺织和服装行业蓬勃发展。顾客不再需要亲自去实体店面，排队试穿衣物，因为成千上万的产品现在都可以在在线目录中找到。然而，由于选项太多，一个有效的推荐系统是必不可少的，以便有效地排序、整理并向用户传达相关的产品资料或信息。有效的时尚推荐系统可以显著提高数十亿顾客的购物体验，并增加提供商的销售和收入。本综述的目的是对在服装和时尚产品特定垂直领域运行的推荐系统进行综述。我们确定了时尚推荐系统研究中最紧迫的挑战，并创建了一个分类法，根据它们试图实现的目标（例如，物品或服装推荐、尺寸推荐、可解释性）对文献进行分类。",
    "tldr": "本综述综合评估了时尚推荐系统领域的最新研究进展，并分类总结出物品和服装推荐、尺寸推荐和可解释性等方面的研究现状。",
