    "translated_abstract": "基于双基础PID控制器通常用于解决具有全局约束的在线分配问题，如在线广告中的预算节奏。然而，控制器在实践中以启发式方式使用，并且对其性能没有可证明的保证。本文针对在线分配问题首次提供了基于双基础PID控制器性能的遗憾界限。我们首先建立了双基础PID控制器与一种名为“卷积反射下降”（Convolutional Mirror Descent，CMD）的新型在线凸优化一阶算法之间的基本联系。CMD根据过去梯度的加权移动平均更新迭代。在特殊情况下，CMD恢复了在线镜像下降与动量和乐观镜像下降。我们建立了足够的条件，在这些条件下CMD可实现对带有对抗性输入的一般在线凸优化问题的低遗憾。我们利用这一新结果给出了关于网络广告中预算节奏问题的性能保证。",
