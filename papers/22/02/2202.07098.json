    "translated_abstract": "在数字干预实验中，在线强化学习和其他自适应采样算法被越来越多地用于优化用户的治疗效果。本文关注于由大量自适应采样算法设计用于利用多个用户的不断累加数据在线优化治疗决策的纵向用户数据。通过合并或\"汇集\"用户数据，自适应采样算法能够潜在地更快地学习。然而，通过汇集，这些算法在样本用户数据轨迹之间引入了依赖关系；我们表明这会导致对于独立同分布数据的标准方差估计低估该数据类型上常见估计量的真实方差。我们通过Z-估计器开发出新的方法来对这种自适应采样数据进行各种统计分析。具体而言，我们引入了\"自适应\"夹心方差估计器——一种校正夹心估计器，可以得到一致的方差估计。",
