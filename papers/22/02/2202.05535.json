    "translated_abstract": "流量分类，即识别在网络中流动的应用类型，对于众多活动（例如入侵检测、路由）都是一个战略性任务。然而当前的深度学习方法并没有解决这个任务所面临的一些关键挑战。现有方法的设计没有考虑到网络硬件（例如路由器）通常是使用有限的计算资源来运行。此外，它们没有满足监管机构所强调的精确解释的需求。最后，这些流量分类器是基于小型数据集进行评估的，这无法反映实际应用程序的多样性。因此，本文提出了一种新型的轻量级、高效率和可解释的卷积神经网络（LEXNet），用于互联网流量分类，该方法依赖于一种新的残差块（用于轻量级和高效率目的）和原型层（用于解释性）。通过商业级数据集的测试，LEXNet 在准确率和速度等方面都显著优于先前的流量分类器。",
