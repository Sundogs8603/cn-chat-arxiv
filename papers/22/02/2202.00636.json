    "translated_abstract": "社区检测的目标是在给定图中用户之间的连接性（由图的邻接矩阵表示）的基础上恢复用户的标签/属性（例如，政治倾向）。最近在理解从随机块模型（SBM）生成的图的社区检测的基本限制方面取得了显著进展。具体而言，已经获得了针对$p$和$q$的SBM的尖锐信息论限制和高效算法，它们分别表示社区内部和社区间的连接概率。本文研究在保护顶点之间的个体连接（边）的隐私的情况下的社区检测问题。我们关注$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-边差分隐私（DP）的概念，旨在理解$(p, q)$、DP预算$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$和具体恢复社区标签的计算效率之间的基本权衡。",
