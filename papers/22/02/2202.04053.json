    "translated_abstract": "最近，DALL-E，一种多模态的转换语言模型及其变种，包括扩散模型，展示了高质量的文本到图像生成能力。然而，尽管有逼真的图像生成结果，对于如何评估这些模型还没有进行详细的分析。在这项工作中，我们研究了不同文本到图像模型的视觉推理能力和社会偏见，涵盖了多模态转换语言模型和扩散模型。首先，我们量化了三种视觉推理能力：对象识别，对象计数和空间关系理解。为此，我们提出了PaintSkills，这是一个用于衡量这些能力的组合式诊断评估数据集。尽管具有高度逼真的图像生成能力，但在对象计数和空间关系理解能力方面，最近模型的性能与上界准确性之间存在很大差距。其次，我们通过测量性别和肤色偏见来评估模型的性别和肤色偏见。",
