    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络将传统的神经网络推广到了图结构数据，并因其出色的表征能力而受到广泛关注。尽管取得了显著的成就，但欧几里得模型在与图相关的学习中的性能仍然受到欧几里得几何的表征能力的限制，特别是对于具有高度非欧几里得潜在解剖的数据集。最近，超边界空间在处理具有树状结构和幂律分布的图数据方面越来越受欢迎，这归功于其指数级的增长特性。在本综述中，我们全面回顾了当前超边界图神经网络的技术细节，将它们统一为一个通用框架，并总结了每个组件的变体。更重要的是，我们介绍了各种与HGNN相关的应用。最后，我们还确定了一些挑战，这些挑战可能成为进一步发展图神经网络成就的指导方针。",
