    "translated_abstract": "随着近年来全球民主倒退和威权主义政权兴起，人们对理解民主国家中威权统治的原因和后果再次产生了兴趣。本文研究了世界上最大的民主国家中威权主义对政治的长期影响。利用印度上世纪70年代意外实施的威权统治的时机，采用差异法（DID）、三重差分法（DDD）和回归跳点估计方法，我发现在随后的几年里，当时主导的印度国大党的政治地位急剧下降。我还提供了证据表明，政治地位的下降并没有导致选民投票率降低，相反，在随后的几年中，反对党候选人参选人数的激增起到了重要的作用。最后，我研究了持久的后果，发现对政治家的信任仍然十分低。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates the long-term political consequences of authoritarianism in India and finds that it led to a sharp decline in the political dominance of the ruling party and a significant increase in the number of opposition candidates. Furthermore, it reveals that trust in politicians remains low."
