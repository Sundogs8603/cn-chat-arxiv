    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了“PEg TRAnsfert Workflow recognition”（PETRAW）挑战的设计与结果，该挑战的目标是基于视频、运动学和分割等单一或多种模态开发外科手术工作流程识别方法，以研究它们的附加值。PETRAW挑战提供了一个包含150个虚拟模拟器上进行的插管转移序列的数据集。该数据集由视频、运动学、语义分割和工作流程注释组成，所述注释在三种不同的粒度级别（阶段、步骤和活动）上描述了序列。参赛者被提出了五项任务：其中三项任务与所有粒度的识别与一种可用的模态相关，而其他任务则通过多种模态的组合来解决识别问题。平均应用相关平衡准确性（AD-Accuracy）被用作评估度量标准，以考虑不平衡的类别，并且因为它比其他度量更具有临床相关性。",
