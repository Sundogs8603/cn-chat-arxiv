    "abstract": "We present a novel framework for analyzing the optimal asset and signal combination problem, which builds upon the dynamic portfolio selection problem of Brandt and Santa-Clara (2006) in two phases. First, we reformulate their original investment problem into a tractable vehicle that admits a closed-form solution, scaling to large dimensions by imposing a joint Gaussian structure on the asset returns and signals. Second, we recast the optimal portfolio of correlated assets and signals into a set of uncorrelated managed portfolios through the lens of Canonical Correlation Analysis of Hotelling (1936). The new investment environment of uncorrelated managed portfolios offers unique economic insights into the joint correlation structure of our optimal portfolio policy. We also operationalize our theoretical framework to bridge the gap between theory and practice, showcasing the improved performance of our proposed method over natural competing benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新颖的框架来分析最优资产和信号组合问题，该框架建立在Brandt和Santa-Clara（2006）的动态组合选择问题之上，分两个阶段。首先，我们将其原始投资问题重构为可伸缩到大尺寸的可处理载体，通过在资产回报和信号上施加联合高斯结构来实现一个封闭式解决方案。其次，我们通过Hotelling（1936）的规范相关分析将相关资产和信号的最优组合转化为一组不相关的托管组合。不相关托管组合的新投资环境为我们的最优组合策略的联合相关结构提供了独特的经济洞察力。我们还将理论框架操作化，以弥合理论和实践之间的差距，展示了我们所提出的方法相对于自然对手竞争标准的改进性能。",
