    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理旨在研究代理人和人类之间的交互，处理和分析大量的自然语言数据。大规模的语言模型在当前自然语言处理中起着重要作用。然而，语言模型的发展带来了可解释性和复杂性的挑战。一种方法是将逻辑关系和规则引入自然语言处理模型中，例如利用自动规划技术。自动规划即AI规划，侧重于构建符号域模型并综合规划，以基于域模型将初始状态转换为目标。最近，有许多与这两个领域相关的工作，可以产生显式知识，例如操作模型的前提条件和效果，并从隐式知识（例如神经模型）中学习。有效地将AI规划与自然语言处理集成可以改善人与机器之间的交流。本文提出了一个框架，该框架结合显式和隐式知识，用于将AI规划与自然语言处理相结合。具体而言，我们首先使用AI规划技术构建域模型并推理自然语言中的逻辑关系。然后，我们利用大规模预训练的语言模型从隐式知识中学习，并改善自然语言的生成。最后，我们在一个真实的数据到文本生成任务上展示了我们的方法的有效性。",
