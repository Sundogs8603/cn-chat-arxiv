    "translated_abstract": "许多应用，如内容审核和推荐，需要对大量的选择进行审查和评分。然而，要以强健的方式进行评分是非常具有挑战性的。实际上，选民的输入不可避免地是稀疏的：大多数选择只有少数选民进行评分。这种稀疏性放大了有偏见的选民引入的不公平，以及寻求通过报告不诚实评分来破坏投票过程的恶意选民的影响。我们给出了强健的稀疏投票问题的确切定义，强调了其潜在的技术挑战，并提出了一种解决该问题的新型投票机制。我们证明，使用这种机制，没有选民可以对每个选择的得分产生超过一个小的可参数化的效果；这是我们称之为Lipschitz韧性的属性。我们还确定了选民可比性的条件，在这些条件下，即使每个选民提供了稀疏的评分，也可以恢复出任何一致的偏好，尺度可能与其它不同。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文提出了一个处理稀疏投票的新型机制，通过限制每个选民对每个选择的得分影响，实现了强健的评分过程。同时，论文还发现了选民可比性的条件，可以在选民提供稀疏评分的情况下恢复出一致的偏好。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel mechanism for handling sparse voting, achieving robust scoring process by limiting the influence of each voter on the scores of each alternative. Additionally, the paper identifies conditions of voter comparability, enabling the recovery of unanimous preferences even with sparse scores provided by the voters."
