The standard statistical approaches to assessment of insurability and potential mispricing are enhanced in several aspects involving consideration of model risk. Model risk can arise from model uncertainty, and parameters uncertainty.

We contrast these robust techniques with standard methods previously used in studying insurabilty of cyber risk. This allows us to accurately assess the critical impact that robust estimation can have on tail index estimation for heavy tailed loss models, as well as the effect of robust dependence analysis when quantifying joint loss models and insurance portfolio diversification. We argue that the choice of such methods is akin to a form of mode",

    "translated_abstract": "本文着重探究模型风险和风险敏感性对网络风险的保险性问题。我们增强了标准的统计方法，考虑到模型风险，特别是由模型不确定性和参数不确定性所导致的风险。通过整合基于边缘和联合网络风险损失过程建模的关键模型参数的各种健壮估算器，我们展示了如何量化模型风险对分析的影响。我们对比了这些健壮技术与之前研究网络风险的标准方法，从而准确评估健壮估算在重尾损失模型的尾指数估计中的关键影响，以及在量化联合损失模型和保险组合多样化时的健壮依赖分析的影响。我们认为，正确选择这些方法就像选择一种保险模型。",
