    "translated_abstract": "在量化金融中，高效地定价多资产期权是一个具有挑战性的问题。当特征函数可用时，基于傅立叶的方法与其他技术相比具有竞争力，因为频率空间中的被积函数通常具有比物理空间中更高的正则性。然而，当设计数值积分方法时，需要仔细考虑对数值复杂性有影响的两个关键因素：（i）确保可积性和控制被积函数的正则性的阻尼参数的选择，以及（ii）处理高维度的有效方法。我们提出了一种基于两个互补思想的有效数值方法来定价欧式多资产期权，以应对这些挑战。首先，我们通过基于提出的优化规则的阻尼参数优化选择来平滑傅立叶被积函数。其次，我们采用稀疏化和维度自适应技术来处理高维度问题。",
