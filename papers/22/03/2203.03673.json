    "abstract": "We propose and analyse a novel statistical procedure, coined AgraSSt, to assess the quality of graph generators that may not be available in explicit form. In particular, AgraSSt can be used to determine whether a learnt graph generating process is capable of generating graphs that resemble a given input graph. Inspired by Stein operators for random graphs, the key idea of AgraSSt is the construction of a kernel discrepancy based on an operator obtained from the graph generator. AgraSSt can provide interpretable criticisms for a graph generator training procedure and help identify reliable sample batches for downstream tasks. Using Stein`s method we give theoretical guarantees for a broad class of random graph models. We provide empirical results on both synthetic input graphs with known graph generation procedures, and real-world input graphs that the state-of-the-art (deep) generative models for graphs are trained on.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出并分析了一种新的统计方法，称为AgraSSt，用于评估可能不存在显式形式的图生成器的质量。特别地，AgraSSt可用于确定学习到的图生成过程能否生成类似给定输入图的图形。受随机图的斯坦操纵符启发，AgraSSt的关键思想是基于从图生成器获得的操作符构建基于核的差异度量。AgraSSt可以为图生成器训练过程提供可解释的问题，并帮助识别可靠的样本批次用于下游任务。利用斯坦的方法，我们对广泛的随机图模型给出了理论保证。我们在已知图生成过程的合成输入图和最先进的（深度）图生成模型训练的真实世界输入图上提供了实证结果。",
