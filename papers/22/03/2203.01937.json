    "translated_abstract": "深度学习方法在医学图像问题的分类精度方面表现出色，这在很大程度上归功于具有清洁标签的大规模数据集的可用性。然而，考虑到这种手动注释的高成本，新的医学图像分类问题可能需要依赖于从放射学报告中提取的机器生成的嘈杂标签。事实上，许多胸部X光分类器已经从带有嘈杂标签的数据集中建模，但它们的训练过程通常不具有噪声标签样本的鲁棒性，导致次优模型。此外，CXR数据集大多是多标记的，因此当前设计用于多类问题的嘈杂标签学习方法不能轻松地进行调整。本文提出了一种新方法，用于嘈杂多标签CXR学习，其中检测并平滑地重新标记数据集中的样本，然后用于训练常见的多标签分类器。该方法优化了一个基于袋的多标签表示方法，以便有效地使用从放射学报告中提取的信息。",
