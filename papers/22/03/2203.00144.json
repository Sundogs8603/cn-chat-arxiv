    "translated_abstract": "Concordance指数（C-index）是生存分析中常用的评估预测模型性能的指标。本文提出了一种将C-index分解为两个数量的加权调和平均的方法：一个用于比较观测事件与其他观测事件的排序，另一个用于比较观测事件与被剪辑的情况的排序。这种分解方法可以对不同生存预测方法之间的优劣进行更细粒度的分析。通过与经典模型和最先进方法的基准比较，以及本文提出的新的变分生成神经网络方法（SurVED），展示了该分解方法的实用性。使用四个公开可用的具有不同剪辑水平的数据集评估模型的性能。通过C-index分解和合成剪辑，分析结果显示深度学习模型更好地利用了观测事件。",
