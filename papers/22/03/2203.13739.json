    "translated_abstract": "量子计算机对于增强机器学习具有巨大潜力，但目前的量子比特数量限制了这一潜力的实现。为了缓解这个限制，可以采用一种技术，在比电路所需的比特少的机器上评估量子电路。这些技术通过在较小的机器上评估许多较小的电路，然后将它们组合成一个多项式来复制较大机器的输出。这种方案对于一般电路而言需要更多的电路评估，这是不切实际的。然而，我们探讨了一种可能性，即对于某些应用来说，许多这些子电路是多余的，并且一个更小的求和足以估计完整的电路。我们构建了一个机器学习模型，可以利用更少的电路评估来逼近较大电路的输出。我们成功地将该模型应用于数字识别任务，使用模拟的量子计算机。",
