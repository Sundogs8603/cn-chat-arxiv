    "abstract": "As social media platforms are evolving from text-based forums into multi-modal environments, the nature of misinformation in social media is also transforming accordingly. Taking advantage of the fact that visual modalities such as images and videos are more favorable and attractive to the users and textual contents are sometimes skimmed carelessly, misinformation spreaders have recently targeted contextual connections between the modalities e.g., text and image. Hence many researchers have developed automatic techniques for detecting possible cross-modal discordance in web-based content. We analyze, categorize and identify existing approaches in addition to challenges and shortcomings they face in order to unearth new research opportunities in the field of multi-modal misinformation detection.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着社交媒体平台从文本为主的论坛转向多模式环境，社交媒体中的虚假信息的性质也相应发生了变化。利用图像和视频等视觉模态更受用户青睐和吸引力的事实，以及文本内容有时被粗略浏览的情况，虚假信息传播者最近开始针对模态之间的上下文连接，例如文本和图像之间的关系。因此，许多研究人员已经开发出自动检测网页内容中可能存在的跨模态不协调的技术。我们分析、分类和识别现有的方法，以及它们面临的挑战和不足之处，以揭示多模式虚假信息检测领域的新研究机会。",
    "tldr": "这项研究总结了多模式虚假信息检测的方法、挑战和机遇。由于社交媒体平台的转变，虚假信息的性质也发生了变化。研究人员已经开发出自动检测跨模态不协调的技术，但仍面临挑战和不足之处，进一步的研究机会也在等待着挖掘。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study summarizes the approaches, challenges, and opportunities in multi-modal misinformation detection. With the evolution of social media platforms, the nature of misinformation has transformed. Researchers have developed automatic techniques to detect cross-modal discordance, but they still face challenges and limitations, leaving room for further research opportunities."
