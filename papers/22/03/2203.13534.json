In this survey, we explore learning scenarios where examples are dependent and their dependence relationship is described by a dependency graph, a commonly utilized model in probability and combinatorics. We collect various graph-dependent concentration bounds, which are then used to derive Rademacher complexity and stability generalization bounds for learning from graph-dependent data. We illustrate this paradigm through practical learning tasks and provide some research directions for future work. To our knowledge, this survey is the first of this kind on this subject.",

    "translated_abstract": "传统统计学习理论依赖于数据独立同分布（i.i.d.）的假设。然而，在许多现实应用中，这种假设往往不成立。本调查中，我们探讨了学习场景中示例之间存在依赖关系，并且这种依赖关系由依赖图描述，这是概率论和组合数学中常用的模型。我们收集了各种图依赖性的集中界限，然后用它们来推导基于Rademacher复杂度和稳定性的学习泛化界限，以适用于基于图依赖性数据的学习。我们通过实际学习任务来说明这一范式，并为未来的研究方向提供了一些建议。据我们所知，这份调查是该主题上第一份此类调查。",
