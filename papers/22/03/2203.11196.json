    "abstract": "Deep Learning and transfer learning models are being used to generate time series forecasts; however, there is scarce evidence about their performance prediction that it is more evident for monthly time series. The purpose of this paper is to compare Deep Learning models with transfer learning and without transfer learning and other traditional methods used for monthly forecasts to answer three questions about the suitability of Deep Learning and Transfer Learning to generate predictions of time series. Time series of M4 and M3 competitions were used for the experiments. The results suggest that deep learning models based on TCN, LSTM, and CNN with transfer learning tend to surpass the performance prediction of other traditional methods. On the other hand, TCN and LSTM, trained directly on the target time series, got similar or better performance than traditional methods for some forecast horizons.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习和迁移学习模型被用于生成时间序列预测，然而对于月度时间序列的性能预测，缺乏证据。本文旨在比较具有迁移学习和没有迁移学习的深度学习模型以及其他传统方法在月度预测中的适用性，回答三个关于深度学习和迁移学习生成时间序列预测的问题。实验使用了M4和M3竞赛的时间序列。结果表明，基于TCN、LSTM和CNN的深度学习模型加上迁移学习往往能够超过其他传统方法的性能预测。另一方面，对于某些预测时段，直接在目标时间序列上训练的TCN和LSTM的性能与传统方法相当或更好。",
