    "translated_abstract": "在横截面环境中，具有异方差和自相关一致（HAC）标准误的最小二乘回归非常有用。然而，在将HAC估计技术应用于时间序列环境时，会面临几个常常被忽视的主要困难。首先，在可能出现强外生性失败的时间序列环境中，OLS参数估计可能不一致，因此即使渐近下也无法进行HAC推断。其次，大多数经济时间序列具有强自相关性，这使得HAC回归参数估计非常低效。第三，强自相关性同样使得HAC条件预测非常低效。最后，流行的HAC估计器的结构不适合捕捉通常存在于经济时间序列中的自回归自相关性，这会产生较大的规模扭曲和HAC假设检验中的功效降低，除非样本数量非常大。",
