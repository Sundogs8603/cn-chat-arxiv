    "translated_abstract": "开放式意图检测是自然语言理解中的一个重大问题，旨在识别未知的开放式意图，同时确保已知意图的识别性能。然而，当前的方法面临两个主要挑战。首先，它们无法学习友好的表示以在只有已知意图的先验知识下检测开放式意图。其次，缺乏获得已知意图的特定而紧凑的决策边界的有效方法。为了解决这些问题，本论文提出了一个名为DA-ADB的原始框架，该框架成功地学习了用于开放式意图检测的距离感知意图表示和自适应决策边界。具体而言，我们首先利用距离信息增强了意图表示的区分能力。然后，我们设计了一种新的损失函数，通过平衡经验和开放空间风险来获得适当的决策边界。广泛的实验证明了我们的框架在三个公共数据集上的有效性，它显著优于现有的最先进方法。",
