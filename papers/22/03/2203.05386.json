With this in mind, we propose a novel framework for generating training examples that are informed by the known styles and strategies of human-authored propaganda. Specifically, we perform self-critical sequence training guided by natural language inference to ensure the validity of the generated articles, while also incorporating propaganda techniques, such as appeal to authority and loaded language. In particular, we create a new training dataset, PropaNews, with 2,256 examples, which we release for future use.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管神经模型能够检测生成的假新闻，但它们的结果不适用于有效检测人工撰写的虚假信息。这是由于机器生成的假新闻和人工撰写的假新闻之间存在巨大差距，包括风格和基本意图方面的显著不同。鉴于此，我们提出了一个新颖框架，通过已知人工宣传的风格和策略来生成训练样本。具体来说，我们进行了自我批判的序列训练，引导自然语言推理以确保所生成的文章的有效性，同时还包括宣传技巧，如权威呼吁和有宣传性的语言。特别是，我们创建了一个新的训练数据集PropaNews，其中包含2,256个示例，并发布以供将来使用。我们的实验结果表明，通过PropaNews训练的假新闻检测器比那些在传统机器生成的假新闻数据集上训练的检测器更适用于检测人工撰写的虚假信息。",
