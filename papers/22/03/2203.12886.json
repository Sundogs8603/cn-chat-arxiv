Because most of these are pre-trained with data in a specific range of amplitude, their objectives do not make them ready for voices in different amplitudes. To overcome this issue, we added a new objective to the masking objective of the Wav2Vec 2.0 model called Random Frequency Pitch (RFP).

    "translated_abstract": "学前评估对教师和家长了解儿童的成长和发展至关重要。COVID-19疫情突显了在线评估学前儿童的必要性。其中一个需要测试的领域是他们的口语能力。由于自动语音识别系统（ASR）是在与儿童不同的频率和振幅特征的声音上进行预训练的，所以无法起到帮助的作用。为了解决这个问题，我们在Wav2Vec 2.0模型的掩模目标中添加了一个称为随机频率变调（RFP）的新目标。此外，我们使用我们新介绍的数据集来对“无意义词”（MW）和“速查自动命名”（RAN）测试进行模型微调。使用掩模与RFP的组合优于Wav2Vec 2.0的掩模目标。",
