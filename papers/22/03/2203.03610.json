    "translated_abstract": "在视觉系统的定位和建图中，对图像中几何区域的高效检测和描述是先决条件。这些系统仍然依赖于传统的手工制作方法来生成轻量级描述符，而更强大的神经网络模型具有高计算和特定硬件要求。本文重点研究了检测和描述神经网络所需的自适应措施，以使它们可以在计算受限的平台上使用，如机器人、移动设备和增强现实设备。为此，我们研究和适应了网络量化技术来加速推理并使其在计算受限的平台上使用。此外，我们重新审视了描述符量化的常见做法，并提出了使用二进制描述符归一化层的方法，使得生成具有一定数量“1”的独特二进制描述符。ZippyPoint是我们的高效量化网络和二进制描述符，实现了在几个标准基准测试中的最先进性能，同时显示出与竞争方法相比数倍的更快推理时间。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents an efficient quantized network with binary descriptors called ZippyPoint, which is based on mixed precision discretization and enables fast interest point detection, description, and matching on computationally limited platforms. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks while showing orders of magnitude faster inference times than competing methods."
