    "abstract": "Attrition is a common and potentially important threat to internal validity in treatment effect studies. We extend the changes-in-changes approach to identify the average treatment effect for respondents and the entire study population in the presence of attrition. Our method, which exploits baseline outcome data, can be applied to randomized experiments as well as quasi-experimental difference-in-difference designs. A formal comparison highlights that while widely used corrections typically impose restrictions on whether or how response depends on treatment, our proposed attrition correction exploits restrictions on the outcome model. We further show that the conditions required for our correction can accommodate a broad class of response models that depend on treatment in an arbitrary way. We illustrate the implementation of the proposed corrections in an application to a large-scale randomized experiment.",

    "translated_abstract": "样本汰换是处理效应研究中常见且潜在重要的内部有效性威胁。本文扩展了变化-变化法，以识别存在样本汰换的受试者和整个研究人群的平均处理效应。我们的方法利用基线结果数据，可应用于随机实验和准实验差异差分设计。形式比较表明，尽管广泛使用的纠正通常对响应是否或如何依赖于处理施加限制，我们提出的样本汰换纠正利用了结果模型的限制。我们进一步表明，所需的条件能够容纳依赖任意方式处理的响应模型的广泛类别。我们在一个大规模随机实验的应用中，说明了所提出的纠正的实现。",
