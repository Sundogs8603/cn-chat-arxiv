    "abstract": "Rapidly diminishing Arctic summer sea ice is a strong signal of the pace of global climate change. We provide point, interval, and density forecasts for four measures of Arctic sea ice: area, extent, thickness, and volume. Importantly, we enforce the joint constraint that these measures must simultaneously arrive at an ice-free Arctic. We apply this constrained joint forecast procedure to models relating sea ice to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and models relating sea ice directly to time. The resulting \"carbon-trend\" and \"time-trend\" projections are mutually consistent and predict a nearly ice-free summer Arctic Ocean by the mid-2030s with an 80% probability. Moreover, the carbon-trend projections show that global adoption of a lower carbon path would likely delay the arrival of a seasonally ice-free Arctic by only a few years.",

    "translated_abstract": "快速减少的北极夏季海冰是全球气候变化速度的强烈信号。我们提供了四个北极海冰衡量指标的点、区间和密度预测：面积、范围、厚度和体积。重要的是，我们强制实施这些指标同时到达无冰北极的联合约束。我们将这个约束联合预测程序应用于将海冰与大气二氧化碳浓度相关的模型和将海冰与时间直接相关的模型。由此得出的“碳趋势”和“时间趋势”预测相互一致，并且预测到在2030年代中期，北极将以80%的概率成为一个几乎无冰的夏季海洋。此外，“碳趋势”预测显示，全球采用更低碳路径可能仅会延迟一个季节性无冰的北极到来数年。",
