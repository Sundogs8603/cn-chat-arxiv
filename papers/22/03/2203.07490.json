    "abstract": "We study the problem of post-processing a supervised machine-learned regressor to maximize fair binary classification at all decision thresholds. Specifically, we show that by decreasing the statistical distance between each group's score distributions, we can increase fair performance across all thresholds at once, and that we can do so without a significant decrease in accuracy. To this end, we introduce a formal measure of distributional parity, which captures the degree of similarity in the distributions of classifications for different protected groups. In contrast to prior work, which has been limited to studies of demographic parity across all thresholds, our measure applies to a large class of fairness metrics. Our main result is to put forward a novel post-processing algorithm based on optimal transport, which provably maximizes distributional parity. We support this result with experiments on several fairness benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究的问题是后处理监督机器学习回归器以在所有决策阈值下最大化公平的二分类问题。具体而言，我们表明通过减少每个组分数分布之间的统计距离，我们可以同时增加所有阈值上的公平性能，并且可以做到在不显着降低准确性的情况下实现。为此，我们介绍了一个形式化的分布平等度量，它捕获了不同保护组的分类分布相似程度。与先前只针对所有阈值的人口统计平等度研究的研究相比，我们的度量适用于大类公平性度量。我们的主要成果是提出一种基于最佳运输的后处理算法，可以证明它最大化了分布平等。我们在几个公平性基准测试上支持此结果。",
