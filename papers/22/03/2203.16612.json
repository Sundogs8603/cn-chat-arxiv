    "abstract": "Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is very popular in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications as it provides a decentralized governance solution through blockchain. We analyze the governance characteristics in the Maker protocol, its stablecoin DAI and governance token Maker (MKR). To achieve that, we establish several measurements of centralized governance. Our empirical analysis investigates the effect of centralized governance over a series of factors related to MKR and DAI, such as financial, transaction, network and twitter sentiment indicators. Our results show that governance centralization influences both the Maker protocol, and the distribution of voting power matters. The main implication of this study is that centralized governance in MakerDAO very much exists, while DeFi investors face a trade-off between decentralization and performance of a DeFi protocol. This further contributes to the contemporary debate on whether DeFi can be truly decentralized. centralized",

    "translated_abstract": "去中心化自治组织(DAO)在去中心化金融(DeFi)应用中非常受欢迎，因为它通过区块链提供了去中心化的治理解决方案。我们分析了Maker协议、其稳定币DAI和治理代币Maker(MKR)的治理特点。为了实现这一目标，我们建立了几个中心化治理的评估指标。我们的实证分析研究了中心化治理对与MKR和DAI相关的一系列因素的影响，如金融、交易、网络和推特情绪指标。我们的研究结果表明，治理中心化影响了Maker协议和投票权的分配很重要。这项研究的主要含义是，MakerDAO的治理很大程度上是中心化的，而DeFi投资者在去中心化和DeFi协议的表现之间面临着一种权衡。这进一步促进了关于DeFi是否真正去中心化的当代辩论。",
