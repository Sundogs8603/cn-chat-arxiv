    "translated_abstract": "我们描述了一种简单而有效的方法（称为光谱属性去除方法; SAL），用于从神经表示中去除私有或保护信息。我们的方法使用矩阵分解将输入表示投影到与保护信息协方差较小的方向上，而不是像因式分解方法那样最大化协方差。我们从线性信息删除开始，并通过使用内核将算法推广到非线性信息删除的情况。我们的实验证明，在删除保护信息后，我们的算法保留了更好的主要任务性能，而不像以前的工作那样删除该信息削弱了性能。此外，实验表明，我们只需少量的被保护属性数据即可去除有关这些属性的信息，这降低了敏感数据的暴露，并更适用于资源有限的情况。可以在https://github.com/jasonshaoshun/SAL上找到代码。",
