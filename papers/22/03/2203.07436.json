    "translated_abstract": "行为量化在神经科学、兽医和动物保护等应用中至关重要。行为分析的关键步骤是首先提取与动物相关的关键点，即姿势估计。然而，可靠的姿势推断目前需要领域知识和手动标注来构建监督模型。我们提出了一系列技术创新，使一种名为SuperAnimal的新方法能够开发和部署深度学习模型，这些模型不需要额外的人工标注和模型训练。SuperAnimal允许对45多个物种进行视频推断，同时只使用两种全局动物姿势模型。如果需要微调模型，我们展示了SuperAnimal模型具有10倍的数据效率，并且胜过先前的迁移学习方法。此外，我们提供了一种新的视频自适应方法来执行无监督的视频细化，并且我们展示了我们的模型在行为分类中的实用性。",
