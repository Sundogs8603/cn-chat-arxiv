    "translated_abstract": "近年来，我们目睹了知识图谱在各个领域的广泛应用，旨在支持问答、推荐等应用。将不同知识图谱中的知识整合的一个常见任务是找到哪些子图引用了同一个现实世界的实体。最近，嵌入方法已被用于实体对齐任务，学习用于保留原始知识图谱中实体相似度的向量空间表示。人们提出了各种受监督、无监督和半监督的方法，这些方法利用了知识图谱中实体的事实（基于属性）和结构信息（基于关系）。然而，根据不同性能指标和知识图谱特征，在现实世界的知识图谱中对它们的优势和劣势进行定量评估的文献尚缺失。在本文中，我们进行了首次对流行的实体对齐嵌入方法进行的元分析，这基于了36篇发表在顶级会议上的论文，并进行了统计和实验性分析。我们的结果提供了对于实体对齐嵌入方法的现状综述，以及它们在不同知识图谱场景下的优点、缺点和适用性。此外，我们还确定并分析了未来研究中的挑战和研究方向。",
