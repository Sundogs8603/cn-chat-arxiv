    "translated_abstract": "神经网络已成功应用于分类、回归、聚类等各个领域。通常情况下，基于BP的迭代训练方法被用于训练神经网络，但是这会导致出现局部最小值的问题、对学习率敏感以及收敛缓慢等问题。为了解决这些问题，提出了基于随机化的神经网络，例如随机向量功能链接（RVFL）网络。RVFL模型具有许多特点，如快速训练速度、直观的连接、简单的结构和通用近似能力，使其成为一种可行的随机化神经网络。本文介绍了RVFL模型演变的第一个全面综述文献，可作为新手和实践者的广泛总结。我们讨论了浅层RVFL、集成RVFL、深层RVFL和集成深层RVFL模型。RVFL模型的变化、改进和应用得到了详细讨论。",
