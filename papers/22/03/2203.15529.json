    "translated_abstract": "当前顶级的基于深度学习（DL）的视觉模型主要基于探索和利用训练数据样本和其关联标签之间的内在相关性。然而，已知的一个实际挑战是它们在\"噪声\"数据对抗下性能下降，噪声数据由于不同情况引起，比如虚假相关性、无关背景、领域转移和对抗攻击。在这项工作中，我们将\"存在噪声\"的二进制信息作为处理输入到图像分类任务中，通过联合估计处理效果来提高预测准确性。受因果变分推断的启发，我们提出了一种基于Transformer的架构，称为处理学习因果Transformer（TLT），它使用潜在的生成模型从当前观测输入中估计鲁棒的特征表示以进行噪声图像分类。根据估计的噪声水平（建模为二进制处理因子），TLT分配相应的推断",
