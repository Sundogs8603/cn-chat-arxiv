    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种用于运动规划的学习动态树扩展（L4KDE）方法。基于树的规划方法，如快速随机树（RRT），是在连续状态空间运动规划中寻找全局最优路径的主要方法。 树的扩展是这些方法的核心步骤，即将新节点添加到不断扩展的树中。我们研究了基于树的运动规划的动力学变体，其中我们已知系统动力学和运动约束。现有方法通常无法优化以找到低成本过渡到采样坐标的节点，而是使用像坐标之间的欧几里德距离这样的指标作为选择候选节点连接到搜索树的启发式。我们提出L4KDE来解决这个问题。L4KDE使用神经网络来预测查询状态之间的过渡成本，从而可以高效地选择节点与样本坐标相连。",
