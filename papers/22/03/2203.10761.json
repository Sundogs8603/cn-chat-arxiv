    "translated_abstract": "Mixup是一种有效的数据增强方法，通过混合数据平滑决策边界，提高神经网络的泛化能力。最近，动态mixup方法通过最大化混合样本中与目标相关的显著区域，有效改进了先前的静态策略（如线性插值），但额外的时间成本是不可接受的。这些额外的计算开销主要来自根据混合标签优化混合样本。然而，我们发现额外的优化步骤可能是多余的，因为标签不匹配的混合样本对于深度模型来定位有差异性特征是有信息量的困难混合样本。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一种名为解耦Mixup（DM）的高效mixup目标函数，而不是提出更复杂的动态mixup策略。其主要效果是DM能够自适应地利用这些困难混合样本来挖掘具有判别特征的信息。",
