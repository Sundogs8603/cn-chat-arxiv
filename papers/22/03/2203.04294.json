    "abstract": "Airway segmentation is essential for chest CT image analysis. Different from natural image segmentation, which pursues high pixel-wise accuracy, airway segmentation focuses on topology. The task is challenging not only because of its complex tree-like structure but also the severe pixel imbalance among airway branches of different generations. To tackle the problems, we present a NaviAirway method which consists of a bronchiole-sensitive loss function for airway topology preservation and an iterative training strategy for accurate model learning across different airway generations. To supplement the features of airway branches learned by the model, we distill the knowledge from numerous unlabeled chest CT images in a teacher-student manner. Experimental results show that NaviAirway outperforms existing methods, particularly in the identification of higher-generation bronchioles and robustness to new CT scans. Moreover, NaviAirway is general enough to be combined with different backbone",
