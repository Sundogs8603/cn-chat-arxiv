    "abstract": "This paper presents a combination of machine learning techniques to enable prompt evaluation of retired electric vehicle batteries as to either retain those batteries for a second-life application and extend their operation beyond the original and first intent or send them to recycle facilities. The proposed algorithm generates features from available battery current and voltage measurements with simple statistics, selects and ranks the features using correlation analysis, and employs Gaussian Process Regression enhanced with bagging. This approach is validated over publicly available aging datasets of more than 200 cells with slow and fast charging, with different cathode chemistries, and for diverse operating conditions. Promising results are observed based on multiple training-test partitions, wherein the mean of Root Mean Squared Percent Error and Mean Percent Error performance errors are found to be less than 1.48% and 1.29%, respectively, in the worst-case scenarios.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种结合机器学习技术的方法，以便及时评估退役电动汽车电池是否适合进行二次利用，以扩展其原本的使用寿命，或者将其送到回收设施。所提出的算法利用简单的统计学应用从可用的电池电流和电压测量中生成特征，并使用相关性分析选择并排序特征，同时采用增强的高斯过程回归进行预测。该方法已在包括慢充和快充、不同阴极化学组成以及多样化操作条件下的超过200个电池的公开老化数据集上进行验证。在多个训练-测试划分的情况下，观察到有希望的结果，在最坏情况下，均方根百分比误差和平均百分比误差性能误差的均值分别小于1.48％和1.29％。",
