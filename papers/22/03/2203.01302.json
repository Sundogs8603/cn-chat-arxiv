    "translated_abstract": "在强化学习中，训练具有普遍能力的智能体仍然是一个重大挑战。改进强化学习智能体鲁棒性的一个有希望的途径是使用课程。一类方法将环境设计视为学生和教师之间的一个游戏，利用基于遗憾的目标来产生学生智能体能力前沿的环境实例（或关卡）。这些方法具有广泛适用性，并在平衡状态下具有理论保证，但在具有挑战性的设计空间中经常难以找到有效的关卡。相比之下，进化方法致力于逐步改变环境复杂性，从而实现潜在的无限学习，但通常依赖于特定领域的启发式方法和大量的计算资源。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于遗憾的课程方法，以合理、有原则地利用进化的力量。我们的方法称为通过编辑关卡逐渐复合复杂性。",
