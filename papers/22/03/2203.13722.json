    "abstract": "Language embeds information about social, cultural, and political values people hold. Prior work has explored social and potentially harmful biases encoded in Pre-Trained Language models (PTLMs). However, there has been no systematic study investigating how values embedded in these models vary across cultures. In this paper, we introduce probes to study which values across cultures are embedded in these models, and whether they align with existing theories and cross-cultural value surveys. We find that PTLMs capture differences in values across cultures, but those only weakly align with established value surveys. We discuss implications of using mis-aligned models in cross-cultural settings, as well as ways of aligning PTLMs with value surveys.",

    "translated_abstract": "语言承载了人们所持有的社会、文化、政治价值观。先前的研究探索了预训练语言模型（PTLMs）中编码的社会和潜在有害的偏见。然而，在透彻研究这些模型中嵌入的不同文化价值观方面，还没有系统的研究。在本文中，我们引入了探针来研究不同文化中模型中嵌入的价值观，以及它们是否与现有的理论和跨文化价值调查相符。我们发现PTLMs捕捉到了文化之间的价值差异，但是这些价值与已有的价值调查只有微弱的相关性。我们讨论了在跨文化环境下使用不符合价值观的模型的影响，以及将PTLMs与价值观对齐的方法。",
