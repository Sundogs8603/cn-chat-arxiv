    "translated_title": "人工智能与自治系统的基于原则的伦理保证论证模式",
    "translated_abstract": "保证案例是一种结构化的论证，通常由安全工程师制作，以传达对于关键或复杂系统（例如飞机）在其既定环境中具有足够安全性的信心。保证案例经常用于系统的第三方审批。在值得信赖的人工智能和自治系统（AI/AS）研究社区中，一个新兴的命题是使用保证案例在确定的环境中运行时，确保特定的AI/AS在伦理上是可接受的。本文大大发展了这个命题并具体阐述了它。它将保证案例方法与一组伦理原则结合起来，以构建一个基于原则的伦理保证论证模式。这些原则包括公正、行善、不伤害、尊重人的自主权和透明度原则。该论证模式以缩写PRAISE命名。本文介绍了该论证模式的目的和具体实施方法，并逐一解释了其组成部分。",
