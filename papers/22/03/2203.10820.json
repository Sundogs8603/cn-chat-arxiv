    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界中，使用人类语音指令进行机器人导航至目的地是自主移动机器人至关重要的。然而，机器人可以采用不同的路径到达同一目标，而最短路径不一定是最优的。因此需要一种方法来灵活地接受waypoint的指标，规划更好的替代路径，即使需要绕路。此外，机器人需要实时推理能力。本研究旨在通过拓扑语义映射实现一个分层的空间表示，并结合语音指令和waypoint进行路径规划。我们提出了SpCoTMHP，一种利用多模式空间概念的层次路径规划方法，包括地点连通性。这种方法提供了一种新颖的集成概率生成模型和快速近似推理方法，层次结构中的各个级别之间可以相互交互。",
