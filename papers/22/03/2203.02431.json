    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了一种新的基于参数曲线的RGB图像车道检测方法。与现有的基于分割和基于点检测的方法不同，曲线方法可以自然地学习整体车道表示，而不需要解码预测或制定大量锚点的启发式方法。为了处理现有多项式曲线方法的优化困难，我们提出利用参数Bézier曲线，因为它易于计算、稳定且具有较高的自由变换度数。此外，我们还提出了一种可变形卷积的特征翻转融合方法，以利用驾驶场景中车道的对称性质。所提出的方法在流行的LLAMAS基准测试上实现了新的最优性能。它也在TuSimple和CULane数据集上实现了良好的准确性，同时保持较低的延迟（> 150 FPS）和小模型大小（<10M）。我们的方法可以作为新的基准，以在路标检测领域推动进一步的研究。",
