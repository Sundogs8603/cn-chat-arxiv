    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in numerous applications. We focus on two understudied aspects of AD that are critical for integration into real-world applications. First, most AD methods cannot incorporate labeled data that are often available in practice in small quantities and can be crucial to achieve high AD accuracy. Second, most AD methods are not interpretable, a bottleneck that prevents stakeholders from understanding the reason behind the anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel AD framework that adapts a white-box model class, Generalized Additive Models, to detect anomalies using a partial identification objective which naturally handles noisy or heterogeneous features. In addition, the proposed framework, DIAD, can incorporate a small amount of labeled data to further boost anomaly detection performances in semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate the superiority of our framework compared to previous work in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings",

    "translated_abstract": "异常检测在许多应用中发挥着重要作用。本文关注异常检测的两个重要方面。首先，大多数异常检测方法无法使用已标记数据，这些数据在实践中往往数量有限，但对于高精度的AD结果至关重要。其次，大多数异常检测方法不可解释，这会阻碍相关方了解异常产生的原因。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了DIAD框架，它采用广义加性模型作为白盒模型，通过部分识别目标检测异常值，自然地处理嘈杂或异质性特征，并能够在半监督设置中使用少量标记数据提高异常检测性能。我们证明了我们的框架相对于以前的工作在无监督和半监督设置下的优越性。",
