    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了保险公司向再保险公司进行最优风险转移的问题。本文中问题的设置与金融学中的最优投资组合问题密切相关，但也存在一些关键区别。特别地，保险公司的盈余（通常情况下）被近似为布朗运动，而不是金融学中用于建模资产的几何布朗运动。此外，通过再保险来降低风险敞口，而不是通过风险投资增加风险。这导致了最优设计中有着有趣的质量差异。本文中，我们使用鞅论方法，推导出了最优设计，该设计是随着终端保险盈余的二次效用最大化的比例性、非廉价再保险设计的一个函数。我们还考虑了多种终端价值的现实限制：严格的下限、概率（风险价值）约束和预期损失（条件风险价值）约束。",
