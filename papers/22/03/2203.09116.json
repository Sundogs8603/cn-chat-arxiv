    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种运动数据增强方案，其中包括鼓励多样性的运动合成和强制物理合理性的运动纠正。这种运动合成包括我们修改后的变分自编码器（VAE）和逆运动学（IK）。在这个VAE中，我们提出的附近样本采样方法可以在训练数据不足的情况下生成各种有效的运动。我们基于IK的运动合成方法可以半自动地生成各种运动。由于这两个方案在合成的运动中会产生不真实的伪影，我们的运动纠正方法会对其进行校正。这种运动纠正方案包括使用物理模拟进行模仿学习和后续的运动去偏倚。对于这个模仿学习，我们提出了显著加速训练过程的PD残余力。此外，我们的运动去偏倚成功地抵消了模仿学习引起的运动偏倚，以最大化增强效果。",
