    "translated_abstract": "随着软件系统的不断增长，测试视频游戏变得越来越困难，传统方法难以扩展。手动测试是一个非常耗时的过程，因此很快就变得成本不可行。使用脚本进行自动化测试是可行的，但在非确定性环境中脚本是无效的，而且知道何时运行每个测试是另一个问题。现代游戏的复杂性、范围和玩家期望正在迅速增加，质量控制占据了生产成本和交付风险的很大一部分。减少这种风险并实现生产对于该行业来说是一个巨大挑战。为了在发布前后保持生产成本的实际性，我们将重点放在预防性质量保证策略以及测试和数据分析自动化上。我们提出了SUPERNOVA（用于新颖软件异常的测试选择和通用缺陷预防在外部存储库中的系统），这是一个负责",
