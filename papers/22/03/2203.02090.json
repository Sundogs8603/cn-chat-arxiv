    "translated_abstract": "在各个领域中，网络数据的普遍存在和从中提取出有用信息的需求，促进了相关模型和算法的快速发展。在众多针对网络数据的学习任务中，社区发现，即发现节点群集或\"社区\"，可能是学术界最受关注的。在许多实际应用中，网络数据通常附带有节点或边缘协变量等附加信息，理想情况下应该利用这些信息进行推断。在本文中，我们通过提出一种具有协变量依赖随机分区先验的贝叶斯随机块模型，为带有协变量的网络社区检测的有限文献增添了新的内容。在我们的先验下，协变量明确地表现为指定聚类成员的先验分布。我们的模型具有建模所有参数估计，包括社区成员身份的不确定性的灵活性。",
