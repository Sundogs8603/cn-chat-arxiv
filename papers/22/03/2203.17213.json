    "abstract": "Numerous analyses of reading time (RT) data have been implemented -- all in an effort to better understand the cognitive processes driving reading comprehension. However, data measured on words at the end of a sentence -- or even at the end of a clause -- is often omitted due to the confounding factors introduced by so-called \"wrap-up effects,\" which manifests as a skewed distribution of RTs for these words. Consequently, the understanding of the cognitive processes that might be involved in these wrap-up effects is limited. In this work, we attempt to learn more about these processes by examining the relationship between wrap-up effects and information-theoretic quantities, such as word and context surprisals. We find that the distribution of information in prior contexts is often predictive of sentence- and clause-final RTs (while not of sentence-medial RTs). This lends support to several prior hypotheses about the processes involved in wrap-up effects.",

    "translated_abstract": "已经实施了许多阅读时间（RT）数据的分析，旨在更好地理解驱动阅读理解的认知过程。然而，由于所谓的“封闭效应”引入的混淆因素，通常会忽略句子末尾甚至从句末尾的单词的数据，这表现为这些单词的RT分布不均衡。因此，对参与这些封闭效应可能涉及的认知过程的理解是有限的。在这项工作中，我们试图通过研究封闭效应与词语和上下文惊讶值等信息论量之间的关系，进一步了解这些过程。我们发现先前上下文中的信息分布通常能够预测句子末尾和从句末尾的RT（而不能预测句中RT），这支持了关于封闭效应涉及的几个先前的假设。",
