    "abstract": "Traditional MVS methods have good accuracy but struggle with completeness, while recently developed learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) techniques have improved completeness except accuracy being compromised. We propose depth discontinuity learning for MVS methods, which further improves accuracy while retaining the completeness of the reconstruction. Our idea is to jointly estimate the depth and boundary maps where the boundary maps are explicitly used for further refinement of the depth maps. We validate our idea and demonstrate that our strategies can be easily integrated into the existing learning-based MVS pipeline where the reconstruction depends on high-quality depth map estimation. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method improves reconstruction quality compared to baseline. Experiments also demonstrate that the presented model and strategies have good generalization capabilities. The source code will be available soon.",

    "translated_abstract": "传统的MVS方法精度较高但完整性不足，而最近开发的基于学习的多视图立体技术具有完整性改善，但牺牲了精度。我们提出了深度不连续性学习的MVS方法，通过共同估计深度和边界地图，进一步提高精度的同时保留重建的完整性。我们的想法是联合估计深度和边界地图，其中边界地图明确用于进一步细化深度地图。我们验证了我们的想法，并证明了我们的策略可以轻松地集成到现有的基于学习的MVS管道中，其中重建取决于高质量的深度地图估计。在各种数据集上的大量实验表明，我们的方法与基准相比改善了重建质量。实验还表明，我们提出的模型和策略具有良好的泛化能力。源代码即将公开发布。",
