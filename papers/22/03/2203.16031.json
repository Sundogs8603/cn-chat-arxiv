    "translated_abstract": "艺术作品的意义计算模型是复杂且困难的，因为艺术解释是多维的且高度主观的。本文实验性地调查了一种最先进的深度卷积神经网络（DCNN）在将现代概念艺术作品正确区分为艺术策展人设计的画廊时的能力。提出了两个假设，即DCNN模型使用展示特征（如形状和颜色）进行分类，而不使用非展示特征（如历史背景和艺术家意图）。利用专门设计的方法验证了这两个假设。使用在ImageNet数据集上预训练并鉴别微调的VGG-11 DCNN模型在真实世界概念摄影画廊中设计的手工数据集上进行训练。实验结果支持了这两个假设，表明DCNN模型忽略了非展示特征，仅使用展示特征进行分类。",
