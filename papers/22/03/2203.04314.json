    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的移动相机图像信号处理（ISP）模型可以生成与专业DSLR相机相媲美的高质量图像。然而，它们的计算要求通常使它们不适合移动设置。此外，现代移动相机采用非Bayer色彩滤色阵列（CFA），如Quad Bayer，Nona Bayer和QxQ Bayer，以提高图像质量，然而，大多数现有的基于深度学习的ISP（或解码）模型主要专注于标准Bayer CFAs。在本研究中，我们提出了PyNET-QxQ，这是一种专门针对QxQ Bayer CFA模式设计的轻量级解析模型，它是从原始的PyNET导出的。我们还提出了一种知识蒸馏方法，称为渐进蒸馏，以更有效地训练减少的网络。因此，PyNET-QxQ的参数少于原始PyNET的2.5％，同时保持其性能。使用原型QxQ相机传感器捕获的QxQ图像的实验表明，PyNET-QxQ在保持图像质量的同时，具有较高的效率和较低的计算成本。",
