    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于其与两阶段定位方法相比具有可比较的准确性但显著更高的效率，一阶视觉定位方法受到了高度关注。然而，对于一阶视觉定位方法来说，物体之间的关系建模还没有得到很好的研究。虽然物体之间的关系建模很重要，但不一定需要在所有物体之间执行，因为只有其中一部分与文本查询相关，可能会困惑模型。我们称这些物体为可疑物体。然而，在一阶视觉定位方法中探索它们之间的关系并不容易，因为：首先，没有物体提议作为选择可疑物体和进行关系建模的基础。第二，可疑物体比其他物体更容易困惑，因为它们可能具有类似的语义，与特定关系纠缠在一起等，从而更容易误导模型的预测。为此，我们提出了一种可疑物体转换机制（SOT），它可以无缝地集成到现有的模型中。",
