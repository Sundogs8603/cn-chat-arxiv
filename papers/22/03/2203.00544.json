    "translated_abstract": "发现计划（DISC）是纽约市教育部门（NYC DOE）用来增加低社会经济背景学生进入专业高中录取人数的政策。这个政策在提高贫困学生进入这些学校的人数方面起到了关键作用。然而，假设学生更关心他们被分配到的学校而不是他们占据的座位类型（即“学校优先座位”假设），我们使用12个最近学年的数据进行的实证分析表明，DISC每年会在处于不利地位的学生中创造约950个组内阻塞对，影响每年约650名处于不利地位的学生。此外，我们发现该计划不尊重进步，因此无意中制造了一种表现不佳的激励机制。这些实验结果得到了我们的理论分析的确认。为了缓解DISC带来的问题，我们探讨了两种替代政策：少数",
