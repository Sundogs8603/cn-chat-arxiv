    "translated_abstract": "虚假信息是一个全球性问题，限制其传播对保护民主、公共卫生和消费者至关重要。我们认为消费者自己的社交媒体帖子历史是一个被低估的数据来源，用于研究是什么导致他们分享虚假新闻链接。在第一项研究中，我们探讨了从帖子历史中提取的文本线索如何区分虚假新闻的分享者和随机社交媒体用户以及其他在误导信息生态系统中的人。在两个数据集中，我们发现虚假新闻的分享者使用更多与愤怒、宗教和权力相关的词汇。在第二项研究中，我们展示了从帖子历史中添加文本线索如何提高模型预测谁有可能分享虚假新闻的准确性。在第三项研究中，我们对从第一项研究中推导出的两种缓解策略进行了初步测试，即激活宗教价值观和减少愤怒，发现它们可以减少虚假新闻的分享和更广泛的分享。在第四项研究中，我们将调查结果与用户的验证推特結合在一起。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes that consumers' own social media post-histories are an underutilized data source in studying the motivations behind sharing fake news. Analyzing textual cues extracted from post-histories, the study finds that fake-news sharers often express anger, religion, and power-related words. Additionally, incorporating these textual cues into models improves the accuracy of predicting fake-news sharing. Furthermore, activating religious values and reducing anger can effectively reduce the sharing of fake news and overall sharing behavior."
