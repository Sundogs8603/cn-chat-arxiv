    "abstract": "This study examines the effects of acquisitions on the retention and R&D productivity of inventors in the biotech sector, using data from 15,318 inventors involved in 1,375 acquisitions between 1990 and 2010. We employ a staggered difference-in-differences approach and find that acquisitions lead to a 13.5% decrease in inventor retention and a 35% drop in citation-weighted patent productivity post-acquisition. The productivity decline is more severe for inventors who remain with the acquiring firm, particularly for those whose expertise is closely tied to the target company. However, older inventors and those whose expertise aligns with the acquiring company's existing R&D portfolio tend to retain higher productivity levels after the acquisition.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究使用1990年至2010年间收集的15,318名发明家参与了1,375次收购的数据，研究了收购对生物技术行业发明家的留任率和研发生产力的影响。我们采用跨时差异法，并发现收购导致发明家的留任率下降13.5%，引用加权专利生产力下降35%。对于留在收购公司的发明家，产品性能下降的更为严重，尤其是那些专业知识与目标公司密切相关的发明家。然而，年长的发明家和专业知识与收购公司现有的研发组合相符的发明家在收购后保持了较高的生产力水平。",
