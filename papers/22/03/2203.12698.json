    "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical model of an autocrat who controls the media in an attempt to persuade society of his competence. We base our analysis on a Bayesian persuasion framework in which citizens have heterogeneous preferences and beliefs about the autocrat. We characterize the autocrat's information manipulation strategy when society is monolithic and when it is divided. When the preferences and beliefs in society are more diverse, the autocrat engages in less information manipulation. Our findings thus suggest that the diversity of attitudes and opinions can act as a bulwark against information manipulation by hostile actors.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个关于独裁者控制媒体来努力说服社会对其能力的理论模型。我们基于贝叶斯说服框架进行分析，其中公民对独裁者的偏好和信念存在异质性。我们在社会一致和社会分化的情况下，对独裁者的信息操纵策略进行了表征。当社会中的偏好和信念更加多样化时，独裁者会减少信息操纵的行为。因此，我们的研究结果表明，态度和意见的多样性可以对抗敌对行为者的信息操纵。",
