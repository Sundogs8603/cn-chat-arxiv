    "translated_abstract": "有效电阻（ER）是一种探究图结构的有吸引力的方法，它是计算图拉普拉斯矩阵特征向量的替代方式。图拉普拉斯矩阵用于在高维数据中找到低维结构。在这方面，基于ER的分析比基于特征向量的方法具有优势。然而，Von Luxburg等人（2010）表明，当顶点对应于从度量空间的分布中采样的样本时，远离点之间的ER收敛到一种无关于图结构的平凡量。我们表明，通过在一个具有$n$个顶点和$n^2$的图中使用缩放电阻，可以得到电压和有效电阻的有意义的极限。我们还表明，通过向度量图添加一个“地面”节点，可以简单自然地计算从一个选定点到所有其他点的所有距离。",

By using scaling resistances, meaningful limits of voltages and effective resistances can be obtained, and by adding a \"ground\" node, distances between a chosen point and all other points can be easily computed."
