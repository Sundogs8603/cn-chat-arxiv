We provide an analysis of this method using the small-gain theorem. Specifically, we prove that this method can be used to find a stationary point, and that the resulting sample complexity improves the state of the art for actor-critic methods to $O \\left(\\mu^{-2} \\epsilon^{-2} \\right)$ to find an $\\epsilon$-approximate stationary point where $\\mu$ is the condition number associated with the critic.",
