Since peer influence is usually confounded with unobserved homophily in observational data, we model the network with a latent variable model to estimate homophily and include it in the outcome equation.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究在治疗社区中是否存在同伴影响或角色模型效应对于成功毕业的影响。我们分析了3个保留了居民之间确认和修正交流记录以及他们入住和离开日期的治疗社区的匿名个体观察数据。这些确认交流使我们能够形成同伴网络，而入住和离开日期使我们能够定义感兴趣的因果效应。我们将因果角色模型效应概念化为居民（自我）观察到他们的某个社交联系人（例如，给予肯定的同伴）在自我离开之前成功毕业与不成功毕业的预期结果之间的差异。由于同伴影响通常与观察数据中未观察到的同质性混淆，我们使用潜变量模型对网络进行建模以估计同质性并将其包含在结果方程中。我们提供了一个理论保证，它可以解决网络中的内生性问题并提供一致的估计。",

Analyzing observational data from three therapeutic communities, the study finds that affirmations from peers have a significant impact on residents' success in graduating before their own departure."
