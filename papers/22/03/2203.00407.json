    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a parameter identification methodology of the SIRD model, an extension of the classical SIR model, that considers the deceased as a separate category. In addition, our model includes one parameter which is the ratio between the real total number of infected and the number of infected that were documented in the official statistics.  Due to many factors, like governmental decisions, several variants circulating, opening and closing of schools, the typical assumption that the parameters of the model stay constant for long periods of time is not realistic. Thus our objective is to create a method which works for short periods of time. In this scope, we approach the estimation relying on the previous 7 days of data and then use the identified parameters to make predictions.  To perform the estimation of the parameters we propose the average of an ensemble of neural networks. Each neural network is constructed based on a database built by solving the SIRD for 7 day",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种SIRD模型的参数识别方法，这是对经典SIR模型的扩展，将死亡人数作为一个独立的类别加以考虑。此外，我们的模型还包括一个参数，即实际感染总数与官方统计的感染人数之比。由于许多因素，如政府决策、多种变体的传播、学校的开闭等，模型参数在长时间内保持不变的典型假设是不现实的。因此，我们的目标是创建一种适用于短时间的方法。在这个范围内，我们通过依赖前7天的数据来进行估计，然后利用确定的参数进行预测。为了进行参数估计，我们提出了一个神经网络集成的平均值方法。每个神经网络是基于通过求解SIRD模型得到的7天数据集构建的。",
