To address this challenge, we develop an end-to-end framework using a meta-learning approach, which enables the model to rapidly adapt to a new prediction task with limited training data for out-of-sample test data. We use three real-world small-scale human subjects datasets (two randomized control studies and one observational study), for which we predict treatment outcomes for held-out treatment groups.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管机器学习的发展在大数据上取得了显著的性能提升，但实际上许多人类受试者的数据规模较小且标记稀疏。已有的方法应用于这样的数据通常不容易泛化到样本外的受试者。相反，模型必须对可能来自不同分布的测试数据进行预测，这是一个称为“零样本学习”的问题。为了解决这个挑战，我们开发了一个端到端的框架，使用元学习方法，使模型能够快速适应有限的训练数据，对于样本外的测试数据进行预测。我们使用了三个真实的小规模人类受试者数据集（两个随机对照研究和一个观察性研究）来预测保留的治疗组的治疗结果。我们的模型学习每种干预的潜在治疗效果，并且能够自然地处理多任务预测。我们展示了我们的模型从整体上表现最佳。",
