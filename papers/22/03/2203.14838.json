Specifically, we first introduce clean speech feature along with the fused feature from IFF-Net as dual-path inputs to recover the suppressed information. Then, we propose style learning to map the fused feature close to clean feature, in order to learn latent speech information from the latter, i.e., clean \"speech style\". Furthermore, we also minimize the distance of final ASR outputs in two paths to improve noise-robustness.

    "translated_abstract": "在嘈杂环境下，自动语音识别（ASR）系统会显著降低。最近，引入了语音增强（SE）作为前端，以减少ASR的噪声，但是它也会压制一些重要的语音信息，即过度抑制。为了缓解这种情况，我们提出了一种双路径式学习方法，用于端到端的噪声抗干扰语音识别（DPSL-ASR）。具体而言，我们首先介绍了干净语音特征，以及来自IFF-Net的融合特征作为双路径输入，以恢复被压制的信息。然后，我们提出了样式学习，将融合特征映射到接近干净特征，以从后者中学习潜在的语音信息，即干净的“语音风格”。此外，我们还通过最小化两个路径的最终ASR输出之间的距离来提高噪声鲁棒性。实验结果表明，所提出的方法相对于最佳IFF-Net基线，在RATS和CHiME-4数据集上分别实现了10.6％和8.6％的词错误率（WER）降低。",
