    "translated_abstract": "日志分析是进行故障或网络事件检测、调查和技术取证分析以实现系统和网络韧性的重要活动。AI算法在日志分析中的潜在应用可以增强这种复杂和繁重的任务。然而，这种解决方案存在一些限制，如日志来源的异构性和没有或很少标签用于训练分类器。当这些标签变得可用时，需要更新分类器。这项基于实践的研究旨在通过使用Transformer构建来仅使用正常的日志条目训练新模型来解决这些挑战。通过多种形式的扰动来增强日志，以作为自监督训练用于特征学习。该模型进一步使用一种有限的标签样本进行强化学习的方式进行微调，以模仿实际情况下有标签可用的情况。我们的模型结构的实验结果显示出很好的性能。",
