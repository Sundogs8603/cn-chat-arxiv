    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在研究入侵攻击，并为区块链网络开发一种新颖的网络攻击检测框架。首先，在实验室中设计和实现一个区块链网络，该网络将用于生成真实的流量数据（包括正常数据和攻击数据），以用于我们的学习模型，并进行实时实验，评估我们提出的入侵检测框架的性能。据我们所知，这是第一个在实验室中合成的用于区块链网络的网络攻击数据集。然后，我们提出了一种新颖的协作学习模型，可以在区块链网络中实现高效部署以检测攻击。所提出的学习模型的主要思想是使区块链节点能够主动收集数据，共享从其数据中学到的知识，并与网络中的其他区块链节点交换知识。通过这种方式，我们不仅能够利用其他节点的知识进行攻击检测，还能够增强整个区块链网络的安全性。",
