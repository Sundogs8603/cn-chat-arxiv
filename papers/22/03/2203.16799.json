    "translated_abstract": "情感表达是日常人类交流中至关重要的部分。对话情感识别（ERC）是一个新兴的研究领域，其主要任务是识别对话中每个话语背后的情感。尽管过去已经对ERC进行了很多工作，但这些工作仅关注英语语言的ERC，忽略了其他任何语言。在本文中，我们提出了Multilingual MELD（M-MELD），将Multimodal EmotionLines数据集（MELD）扩展到英语之外的4种其他语言，分别为希腊语、波兰语、法语和西班牙语。除了为所有这4种语言建立强大的基线之外，我们还提出了一种新颖的架构DiscLSTM，它在对话中使用顺序和交际语境进行ERC。我们提出的方法计算效率高，可以使用跨语言编码器跨语言传输，并且比大多数单模态文本方法具有更好的性能。",
