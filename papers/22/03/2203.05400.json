    "translated_abstract": "常见的方法是用Matern协方差核将确定性响应函数（如计算机实验的输出）建模为高斯过程。Matern核的光滑参数决定了模型在大数据极限下的许多重要属性，包括条件均值收敛到响应函数的速率。我们证明，当数据在固定有界子集$\\mathbb{R}^d$上获得时，光滑参数的最大似然估计不能在渐近意义下欠平滑真值。换句话说，如果数据生成的响应函数具有Sobolev光滑度$\\nu_0 > d/2$，那么光滑参数估计不能在渐近意义下小于$\\nu_0$。这一下界是精准的。此外，我们还展示了最大似然估计在一类分段支持自相似函数中能恢复真实的光滑度。对于交叉验证，我们证明了一个渐近下界$\\nu_0-d/2$，但这很不可能成立。",
