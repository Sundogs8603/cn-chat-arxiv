    "translated_abstract": "在环境监测或灾害响应任务等应用中，主动搜索涉及到自主代理在搜索空间中使用决策算法检测目标，这些算法会根据历史观察结果进行调整。主动搜索算法必须处理两种类型的不确定性：检测不确定性和位置不确定性。在机器人领域中，更常见的方法是专注于位置不确定性，通过将检测概率阈值设定为零或一来消除检测不确定性。相反，在稀疏信号处理文献中，通常假定目标位置准确，并专注于其检测的不确定性。在本文中，我们首先提出一种推理方法来同时处理目标检测和位置不确定性。然后，基于这个推理方法构建一个使用汤普森抽样的决策算法，使得分散式多智能体主动搜索成为可能。我们进行了模拟实验，证明我们的算法在检测率和资源效率方面优于现有方法。",
