    "translated_abstract": "在地球观测的背景下，变化检测是通过多时相图像来实现的，这些图像由可能具有不同空间和/或光谱分辨率甚至不同模态（例如光学，雷达）的传感器获取。 即使限制为光学模态，只要传感器具有不同的空间和/或光谱分辨率，这项任务就已经被证明具有挑战性。本文提出了一种新的针对这种所谓的异构光学传感器获取的图像的无监督变化检测方法。该方法利用了最近的进展，将变化检测问题框架化为强大的融合框架。更具体地说，我们展示了一个深度对抗网络，旨在事先设计和训练以融合一对多波段光学图像，可以很容易地通过具有相同架构的网络来补充执行变化检测。生成的整体架构本身遵循对抗性策略，其中融合网络和其他网络。",
