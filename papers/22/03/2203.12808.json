    "abstract": "We discuss causal inference for observational studies with possibly invalid instrumental variables. We propose a novel methodology called two-stage curvature identification (TSCI), which explores the nonlinear treatment model with machine learning and adjusts for different forms of violating the instrumental variable assumptions. The success of TSCI requires the instrumental variable's effect on treatment to differ from its violation form. A novel bias correction step is implemented to remove bias resulting from potentially high complexity of machine learning. Our proposed TSCI estimator is shown to be asymptotically unbiased and normal even if the machine learning algorithm does not consistently estimate the treatment model. We design a data-dependent method to choose the best among several candidate violation forms. We apply TSCI to study the effect of education on earnings.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们讨论了在可能存在无效工具变量的观测研究中的因果推断问题。我们提出了一种名为“两阶段曲率识别”(TSCI)的新方法，它使用机器学习探索非线性治疗模型，并调整不同形式的其他工具变量假设违背。TSCI的成功需要工具变量对治疗的影响与其违背形式不同。我们实现了一步新颖的偏差校正来消除可能高复杂度机器学习所造成的偏差。我们提出的TSCI估计器即使机器学习算法不能一致地估计治疗模型，也被证明是渐进无偏和正态的。我们设计了一个数据依赖方法来选择几个候选违背形式中的最佳形式。我们应用TSCI研究了教育对收入的影响。",
