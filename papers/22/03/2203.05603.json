    "translated_abstract": "拓扑数据分析（TDA）是一种现代的数据分析方法，专注于数据的拓扑特征；近年来，它在生物学、物理学和许多其他领域得到了广泛研究和广泛应用。然而，金融市场在TDA的研究方面尚有所欠缺。本文介绍了TDA在金融市场上的一些最新应用，包括在金融市场湍流周期的早期检测中的应用，以及TDA如何帮助投资者获得新的见解。此外，我们提出了一种基于持久同调的新型湍流指标，该指标似乎能够捕捉金融数据中的关键转折点；我们使用不同的金融时间序列（如标准普尔500指数、罗素2000指数、标普/墨西哥国际证券交易所IPC指数和日经225指数）以及崩盘事件（黑色星期一崩盘、互联网泡沫崩盘、2007-08崩盘和COVID-19崩盘）对我们的指标进行了测试。此外，我们还介绍了持久同调的概念，以便读者能够在不了解该领域的情况下理解本文。",
