    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习（SSL），包括主流的对比学习，在没有数据注释的情况下取得了很大的成功，可以学习视觉表示。然而，大多数方法主要关注实例级信息（即，相同实例的不同增强图像应具有相同的特征或聚集到相同的类别），但对不同实例之间的关系缺乏关注。在本文中，我们介绍了一种新的自监督学习范式，即关系式自监督学习（ReSSL）框架，通过建模不同实例之间的关系来学习表示。具体而言，我们提出的方法利用不同实例之间的成对相似性的锐化分布作为“关系”度量，然后利用该度量匹配不同增强的特征嵌入。为了提高性能，我们认为弱增强对于表示更可靠的关系很重要，并利用动量技术来实现。",
