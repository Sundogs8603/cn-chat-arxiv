    "translated_abstract": "最近的理论研究表明，当种群规模足够大时，NSGA-II可以高效地计算出完整的帕累托前沿。本文研究了当种群规模较小时，它对帕累托前沿的逼近程度。对于OneMinMax基准测试，我们指出在某些情况下，父代和后代很好地覆盖了帕累托前沿，但是下一代的帕累托前沿存在较大的间隙。我们的数学证明表明，造成这种不希望的行为的原因是NSGA-II在选择阶段只计算了拥挤距离一次，然后删除具有最小拥挤距离的个体，而没有考虑到删除会增加某些个体的拥挤距离。然后，我们分析了两种不容易出现这个问题的变体。对于在每次删除后更新拥挤距离的NSGA-II（Kukkonen and Deb（2006））和稳态NSGA-II（Nebro and Durillo（2009）），我们证明了帕累托前沿的间隙永远不会超过一个很小的值。",

    "en_tdlr": "Recent research has shown that NSGA-II efficiently computes the complete Pareto front when the population size is sufficiently large. However, when the population size is small, NSGA-II has a poor approximation of the Pareto front, particularly with large gaps. This paper provides mathematical proofs to identify the cause of this issue and proposes two alternative approaches."
