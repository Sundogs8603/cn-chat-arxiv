However, under heavy-tailed distributions, these moments may not exist in the population. Our empirical analysis reveals that population kurtosis, skewness, and variance often do not exist for the conditional distribution of earnings growth. This challenges moment-based analyses. We propose robust conditional Pareto exponents as novel earnings risk measures, developing estimation and inference methods. Using the UK New Earnings Survey Panel Dataset (NESPD) and US Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we find: 1) Moments often fail to exist; 2) Earnings risk increases over the life cycle; 3) Job stayers face higher earnings risk; 4) These patterns persist during the 2007--2008 recession and the 2015--2016 positive growth period.",

    "translated_abstract": "文献通常使用基于矩的收益风险衡量方法，如方差、偏度和峰度。然而，在重尾分布下，这些矩可能在总体中不存在。我们的实证分析发现，收益增长的条件分布中，总体峰度、偏度和方差通常不存在。这挑战了基于矩的分析。我们提出稳健的条件Pareto指数作为新颖的收益风险衡量标准，并发展了估计和推断方法。利用英国新收入调查面板数据集（NESPD）和美国收入动态面板研究（PSID），我们发现：1）矩经常不存在；2）收益风险随着生命周期增加；3）稳定工作者面临更高的收益风险；4）这些模式在2007-2008年衰退期和2015-2016年增长期间持续存在。",
