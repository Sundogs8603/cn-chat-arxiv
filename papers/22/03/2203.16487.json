    "translated_abstract": "与之前一些牺牲翻译质量加速自回归翻译（AT）的工作不同，我们提出了Speculative Decoding（SpecDec）-一种受计算机体系结构中的推测执行启发的新型解码范式，它结合了AT和非自回归翻译（NAT）的各自优势，实现了在翻译过程中的无损加速。在每个解码步骤中，SpecDec首先使用NAT模型推测性地预测（即解码）下一个k个标记，然后使用AT模型验证这些标记，只有通过验证的预测标记才会被接受作为解码结果，以确保其翻译结果与AT完全相同。NAT的推测和AT的验证之间的协作使得解码速度大大提高，同时不损失翻译质量，这是由于推测解码所支持的并行计算。我们在4个标准WMT翻译基准上进行实验，并证实原始的SpecDec与AT贪婪解码的结果完全相同，速度提高了约 $k$倍。",

It speculatively predicts the next token and verifies it with an AT model, ensuring the same translation result as AT. The collaboration of speculative decoding and verification achieves faster decoding without compromising translation quality. Experimental results show that vanilla SpecDec yields the same results as AT greedy decoding."
