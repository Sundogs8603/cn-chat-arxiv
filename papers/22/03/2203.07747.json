    "translated_abstract": "模型预测控制(MPC)已成为高性能自主系统嵌入式控制的流行框架。然而，要使用MPC实现良好的控制性能，精确的动力学模型是关键。为了保持实时操作，嵌入式系统上使用的动力学模型一般限于简单的基于第一原理的模型，这显著限制了它们的表示能力。与这种简单模型相反的是，机器学习方法，特别是神经网络，已经被证明可以准确地建模复杂的动态效应，但它们的巨大计算复杂性阻碍了它们与快速实时迭代循环的结合。本文提出了实时神经MPC框架，用于在模型预测控制流程中高效地集成大型复杂神经网络架构作为动力学模型。我们在模拟和高度灵活的四旋翼平台上进行了实验，证明了所描述系统的能力，展示了其能够实现基于深度神经网络的学习动力学模型在实时控制中高性能的控制能力。",
