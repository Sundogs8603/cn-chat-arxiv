    "translated_abstract": "航运业是最强的人类排放NOx物质的行业之一，而这种物质对人类健康和环境都有害。该行业的迅速增长导致社会对控制船只排放水平的压力增加。目前用于船舶排放监测的所有方法都很昂贵且需要接近船只，这使得全球和连续的排放监测变得不可能。一种有希望的方法是应用遥感技术。研究表明，利用Copernicus Sentinel 5光学载荷上的TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument测量可以视觉上区别出单个船只的某些NO2排放。为了部署基于遥感的全球排放监测系统，需要自动化程序来估算单个船只的NO2排放。由于可用数据的信噪比极低且缺乏地面真实性，这是一个充满挑战的任务。本文提出了一种监督分割方法，该方法采用卷积神经网络，能够从TROPOMI卫星数据中准确地识别单个船只的NO2排放。",
