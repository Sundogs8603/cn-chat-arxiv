    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了再生粒子汤普森抽样（RPTS），这是汤普森抽样的一种灵活变体。汤普森抽样本身是一种贝叶斯启发式算法，用于解决随机赌博机问题，但由于维护连续的后验分布的复杂性，它很难在实践中实现。粒子汤普森抽样（PTS）是汤普森抽样的一种近似方式，通过用离散分布替换在一组加权静态粒子上支持的连续分布来获取。我们观察到在PTS中，除了少数适应的粒子之外，所有其他粒子的权重都收敛于零。RPTS基于启发式方法：删除衰减的不适应粒子，并在适应的幸存粒子附近再生新粒子。实证结果表明，从PTS到RPTS的普遍改进和RPTS在一组代表性赌博问题中的灵活性和功效，包括对5G网络切片的应用。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a flexible variation of Thompson sampling called regenerative particle Thompson sampling (RPTS), which solves the issue of particle weight convergence by regenerating new particles in the vicinity of fit surviving particles. Empirical evidence shows an improvement in performance compared to the previously used particle Thompson sampling (PTS) and the efficacy of RPTS across a set of bandit problems, including an application to 5G network slicing."
