    "translated_abstract": "本研究展示了一个可测试的条件，用于在观测数据中识别治疗对结果的因果效应，该条件基于两组变量：需要控制的观测协变量和被怀疑的工具变量。在实证应用中常见的因果结构下，被怀疑的工具变量与结果（在给定治疗和协变量的条件下）的可测试条件独立性有两个含义。第一，工具变量是有效的，即它不直接影响结果（除了通过治疗）并在协变量条件下未受到混淆。第二，治疗在协变量条件下不受混淆，因此治疗效应得以确定。我们建议使用基于机器学习方法的条件独立性测试，以数据驱动的方式考虑协变量，并在模拟研究中研究其渐近行为和有限样本性能。我们还将我们的方法应用于真实数据，以说明其适用性。",
