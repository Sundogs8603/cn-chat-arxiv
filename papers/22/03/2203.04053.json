    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了股权联动保险产品中的最优投资再保险问题。这种产品通常具有资本保证，这可以激励保险公司购买再保险。由于再保险合同意味着保险公司和再保险公司之间的互动，我们将优化问题建模为斯塔克尔伯格博弈。再保险公司是博弈中的领导者，通过选择其最优投资策略和向保险公司提供的再保险合同中的安全加载来最大化其预期效用。再保险公司可以评估保险公司对再保险公司每个行动的合理反应。保险公司是追随者，通过选择其投资策略和以再保险公司提供的价格购买的再保险金额来最大化其预期效用。在这个博弈中，我们推导出了一般效用函数的斯塔克尔伯格均衡。对于幂函数效用函数，我们明确计算了均衡值。",
