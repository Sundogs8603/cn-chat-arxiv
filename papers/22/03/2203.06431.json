    "translated_abstract": "4D CT成像是胸部/腹部肿瘤放疗的重要组成部分。然而，4D CT图像经常受到损伤迹的影响，这会影响治疗规划的质量。本文提出基于深度学习（DL）的条件修复技术，以恢复受损部位的解剖正确的图像信息。修复方法包括两个阶段：DL-based检测常见的插值（INT）和双重结构（DS）伪影，然后应用条件修复技术到伪影部位。在这个语境中，条件指的是通过患者特定的图像数据来指导修复过程，以确保解剖学可靠的结果。该研究基于65名肺癌患者的内部4D CT图像（48名轻微受损，17名明显受损），以及两个公开可用的4D CT数据集作为独立外部测试集。自动伪影检测显示ROC-AUC为0.99的INT和0.97的DS。",
