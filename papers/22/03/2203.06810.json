    "translated_abstract": "可变形图像配准在医学图像分析的各种任务中起着至关重要的作用。一个成功的配准算法，无论是从传统能量优化还是深度网络中导出，都需要计算机专家花费大量的精力来设计良好的配准能量或者为特定类型的医学数据精心调整网络架构。为了解决上述问题，本文提出了一种自动学习配准算法（AutoReg），它可以协同优化网络架构和相应的训练目标，使非计算机专家（例如医学/临床用户）能够方便地找到适用于不同场景的现成配准算法。具体而言，我们建立了一个三层框架，通过自动搜索机制和协同优化推导出配准网络架构和目标。我们在多站点体积数据集和各种配准任务上进行了图像配准实验。",
