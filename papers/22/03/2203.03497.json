    "abstract": "When using dyadic data (i.e., data indexed by pairs of units), researchers typically assume a linear model, estimate it using Ordinary Least Squares and conduct inference using ``dyadic-robust\" variance estimators. The latter assumes that dyads are uncorrelated if they do not share a common unit (e.g., if the same individual is not present in both pairs of data). We show that this assumption does not hold in many empirical applications because indirect links may exist due to network connections, generating correlated outcomes. Hence, ``dyadic-robust'' estimators can be biased in such situations. We develop a consistent variance estimator for such contexts by leveraging results in network statistics. Our estimator has good finite sample properties in simulations, while allowing for decay in spillover effects. We illustrate our message with an application to politicians' voting behavior when they are seating neighbors in the European Parliament.",

    "translated_title": "线性二元数据模型与网络溢出中的推断",
    "translated_abstract": "在使用二元数据（即按单位对索引的数据）时，研究人员通常假设一个线性模型，使用最小二乘法进行估计，并使用“二元鲁棒”方差估计器进行推断。后者假设如果二元数据不共享一个单位（例如，相同个体不同时出现在两个数据对中），则二元数据是不相关的。我们表明，在许多经验应用中，这种假设并不成立，因为由于网络连接而可能存在间接链路，生成相关的结果。因此，在这种情况下，“二元鲁棒”估计器可能存在偏差。我们通过利用网络统计结果，为这种情境开发了一种一致的方差估计器。我们的估计器在模拟中具有良好的有限样本性质，同时允许溢出效应的衰减。我们通过对欧洲议会中的政治家投票行为的应用来说明我们的观点。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new approach to address network spillovers in linear dyadic data models. In many empirical applications, the inference of dyadic data is often correlated due to indirect links caused by network connections, which leads to biased estimates with traditional \"dyadic-robust\" methods. By leveraging network statistics, the paper develops a consistent variance estimator to tackle this issue, with demonstrated effectiveness in the context of politicians' voting behavior in the European Parliament."
