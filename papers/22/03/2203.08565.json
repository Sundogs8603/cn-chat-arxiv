    "translated_abstract": "虽然已经证明预训练语言模型（PLMs）具有丰富的语言知识，但现有的研究大多忽视了与语言无关的地理知识，这些知识通常难以通过仅对文本进行预训练获得。我们通过在多任务学习框架中结合语言建模和地理位置预测来填补这一空白，提出了地理适应性（geoadaptation）。我们对来自三个地理区域的语言组的四个PLMs进行地理适应，并在五个不同的任务上评估它们：经过微调的（即有监督的）地理位置预测、零样本（即无监督的）地理位置预测、经过微调的语言识别、零样本语言识别以及零样本方言特征预测。地理适应性非常成功地将地理语言知识注入到PLMs中：经过地理适应的PLMs在不同任务上表现出色。",
