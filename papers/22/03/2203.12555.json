    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种用于表格结构识别（TSR）评估的新类度量标准，称为网格表相似度（GriTS）。与以往的度量标准不同，GriTS直接以矩阵的自然形式评估预测表的正确性。为了创建矩阵之间的相似性度量，我们将二维最长公共子结构（2D-LCS）问题推广到二维最相似子结构（2D-MSS）问题，并提出了一种可以在多项式时间内解决该问题的启发式算法。该算法产生了真实相似性的上限和下限。我们使用大型真实数据集的评估显示，在实践中这些边界之间几乎没有区别。我们将GriTS与其他度量标准进行了比较，并以实验证明矩阵相似性在TSR性能评估方面比其他方法具有更理想的行为。最后，GriTS将单元拓扑识别、单元定位识别和单元内容提取三个子任务统一起来。",
