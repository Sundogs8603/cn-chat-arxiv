    "abstract": "This paper studies how gifts - monetary or in-kind payments - from drug firms to physicians in the US affect prescriptions and drug costs. We estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by combining physician-level data on antidiabetic prescriptions and payments with causal inference and machine learning methods. We find that payments cause physicians to prescribe more brand drugs, resulting in a cost increase of $30 per dollar received. Responses differ widely across physicians, and are primarily explained by variation in patients' out-of-pocket costs. A gift ban is estimated to decrease drug costs by 3-4%. Taken together, these novel findings reveal how payments shape prescription choices and drive up costs.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了制药公司向美国医生进行的礼物、货款等赠送方式如何影响处方和药物成本。我们利用因果推断和机器学习方法，结合针对糖尿病处方和付款的医生层面数据估计出异质性处理效应。我们发现，礼品会让医生更多地开具品牌药品处方，导致每收到1美元的费用增加30美元的成本。反应在医生身上的差异很大，且主要是由患者自费的费用变化所解释的。禁止礼品赠送估计可以使药品成本降低3-4%。这些新的发现揭示了礼品如何塑造处方选择并推高成本。",
