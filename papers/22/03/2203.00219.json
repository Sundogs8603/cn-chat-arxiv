    "translated_abstract": "随着智能电表收集和传输家庭能源消耗数据给零售能源供应商（REP），最大的挑战是确保有效利用细粒度的消费者数据的同时保护数据隐私。本文针对能源负载消耗预测，解决了这一问题，这对于能源需求管理、负载切换和基础设施发展非常重要。具体而言，现有的能源负载预测是集中的，不可扩展，最重要的是容易遭受数据隐私威胁。此外，REP 是各自的市场参与者，并有责任保护自己客户的隐私。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的水平隐私保护联邦学习框架，即 FedREP。我们考虑了一个联邦学习系统，由一个控制中心和多个零售商组成，通过启用多个 REP 构建一个共同的、强大的机器学习模型来解决问题。",
