    "abstract": "In real-world edge AI applications, their accuracy is often affected by various environmental factors, such as noises, location/calibration of sensors, and time-related changes. This article introduces a neural network based on-device learning approach to address this issue without going deep. Our approach is quite different from de facto backpropagation based training but tailored for low-end edge devices. This article introduces its algorithm and implementation on a wireless sensor node consisting of Raspberry Pi Pico and low-power wireless module. Experiments using vibration patterns of rotating machines demonstrate that retraining by the on-device learning significantly improves an anomaly detection accuracy at a noisy environment while saving computation and communication costs for low power.",

    "translated_abstract": "在真实世界的边缘人工智能应用中，其准确性经常受到各种环境因素的影响，如噪声、传感器的位置/校准和时间相关的变化。本文介绍了一种基于神经网络的设备上学习方法，以解决这个问题而不需要深入了解。我们的方法与事实上的反向传播训练有很大区别，而是专为低端边缘设备量身定制。本文介绍了其算法和在由树莓派Pico和低功耗无线模块组成的无线传感器节点上的实现。通过使用旋转机器的振动模式进行实验证明，通过设备上学习的重新训练在嘈杂环境下显著提高了异常检测的准确性，同时节约了低功耗设备的计算和通信成本。",
