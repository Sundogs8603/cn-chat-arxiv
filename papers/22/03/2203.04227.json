    "translated_abstract": "随着设备间自主计算、通信和协作的流行，物联网（IoT）网络已经变得无所不在。在IoT网络中使用中继进一步方便了部署，因为中继提供了许多好处，如增加通信范围和最小化电力消耗。但传统的用于这种双跳继电器IoT网络的AoI调度器的现有文献有限，因为它们是基于假设恒定/不变的信道条件和已知的（通常是随意生成的）数据包生成模式设计的。针对带中继的双跳IoT网络的AoI调度已经研究了深度强化学习（DRL）算法，但是由于动作空间随着网络规模的增大呈指数增长，它们仅适用于小规模IoT网络。这些局限性阻碍了对AoI调度器在IoT网络中的实际应用。本文提出了一种针对带中继的IoT网络的实用AoI调度器，该调度器考虑了常见的动态信道条件和未知数据包生成模式。通过广泛的模拟，证明了所提出的调度器在平均AoI、数据包丢失率和能量消耗方面优于现有的最先进的AoI调度器。",

Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheduler outperforms existing state-of-the-art AoI schedulers in terms of average AoI, packet loss rate, and energy consumption."
