    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了在一个稀疏的$q$-uniform超图$G$中进行社区检测的问题，假设$G$是根据超图随机块模型(HSBM)生成的。我们证明了基于超图非回退算子的谱方法在高概率下能够达到Angelini等人(2015)猜测的广义Kesten-Stigum检测阈值。我们对稀疏HSBM的非回退算子的谱进行了表征，并利用超图的Ihara-Bass公式提供了一个高效的维度约减过程。因此，对于有$n$个顶点的稀疏HSBM，社区检测可以约化为一个$2n\\times 2n$的非正常矩阵的特征向量问题，该矩阵由超图的邻接矩阵和度矩阵构成。据我们所知，这是第一个能够证明并高效实现HSBM猜测阈值的谱算法。",
