    "abstract": "Human speech data comprises a rich set of domain factors such as accent, syntactic and semantic variety, or acoustic environment. Previous work explores the effect of domain mismatch in automatic speech recognition between pre-training and fine-tuning as a whole but does not dissect the contribution of individual factors. In this paper, we present a controlled study to better understand the effect of such factors on the performance of pre-trained representations on automatic speech recognition. To do so, we pre-train models either on modified natural speech or synthesized audio, with a single domain factor modified, and then measure performance after fine-tuning. Results show that phonetic domain factors play an important role during pre-training while grammatical and syntactic factors are far less important. To our knowledge, this is the first study to better understand the domain characteristics of pre-trained sets in self-supervised pre-training for speech.",

    "translated_abstract": "人类语音数据由口音、句法和语义多样性以及声学环境等丰富的领域因素构成。先前的工作探讨了预训练和微调之间领域不匹配对自动语音识别整体表现的影响，但并未分解个别因素的差异贡献。本文提供了一项对受控研究，以更好地了解个别因素对自动语音识别预训练表示性能的影响。为此，我们以单个领域因素进行自然语音或合成音频的预训练，然后在微调后测量性能。结果显示，语音学领域因素在预训练中起着重要作用，而语法和句法因素则远不及其重要。据我们所知，这是第一项研究，以更好地了解自我监督训练语音预训练集的领域特征。",
