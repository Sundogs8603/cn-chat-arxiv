    "abstract": "Despite recent advances of AI, story understanding remains an open and under-investigated problem. We collect, preprocess, and publicly release a video-language story dataset, Synopses of Movie Narratives (SYMON), containing 5,193 video summaries of popular movies and TV series. SYMON captures naturalistic story-telling videos for human audience made by human creators. As a prototypical and naturalistic story dataset, SYMON features high coverage of multimodal story events, abundant mental-state descriptions, and large semantic gaps between the visual and the textual modalities. We establish benchmarks on video-text retrieval and zero-shot alignment on movie summary videos, which showcase the importance of in-domain data in story understanding. With SYMON, we hope to lay the groundwork for progress in multimodal story understanding.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管AI有了最近的进展，但故事理解仍然是一个未被充分研究的问题。我们收集、预处理并公开发布了一个视频语言故事数据集SYMON，其中包含5,193个流行电影和电视剧的视频摘要。SYMON捕捉了由人类创作者制作的面向人类观众的自然故事叙述视频。作为一个原型和自然故事数据集，SYMON具有高覆盖的多模态故事事件、丰富的心理状态描述和视觉和文本模态之间的大语义差距。我们建立了视频文本检索和电影摘要视频的零样本对齐的基准，展示了在故事理解中领域内数据的重要性。通过SYMON，我们希望为多模态故事理解的进展打下基础。",
