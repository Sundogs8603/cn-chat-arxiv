    "abstract": "Learning from label proportions (LLP) is a weakly supervised classification problem where data points are grouped into bags, and the label proportions within each bag are observed instead of the instance-level labels. The task is to learn a classifier to predict the individual labels of future individual instances. Prior work on LLP for multi-class data has yet to develop a theoretically grounded algorithm. In this work, we provide a theoretically grounded approach to LLP based on a reduction to learning with label noise, using the forward correction (FC) loss of \\citet{Patrini2017MakingDN}. We establish an excess risk bound and generalization error analysis for our approach, while also extending the theory of the FC loss which may be of independent interest. Our approach demonstrates improved empirical performance in deep learning scenarios across multiple datasets and architectures, compared to the leading existing methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "标签比例学习（LLP）是一个弱监督分类问题，其中数据点被分组为包，每个包中观察到的是包内的标签比例，而不是单个实例的标签。任务是学习一个分类器来预测未来单个实例的标签。之前在多类数据上针对LLP的工作尚未开发出一个有理论基础的算法。在这项工作中，我们提供了一个基于标签噪声学习的理论基础方法，使用\\citet{Patrini2017MakingDN}的正向校正（FC）损失。我们建立了我们方法的过度风险界和泛化误差分析，同时扩展了FC损失的理论，这可能具有独立的研究意义。与现有的主要方法相比，我们的方法在深度学习场景下多个数据集和架构上表现出了改进的实证性能。",
