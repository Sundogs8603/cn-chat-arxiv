Robust statistical arbitrage strategies refer to trading strategies that enable profitable trading under model ambiguity. The presented novel methodology allows to consider a large amount of underlying securities simultaneously and does not depend on the identification of cointegrated pairs of assets, hence it is applicable on high-dimensional financial markets or in markets where classical pairs trading approaches fail. Moreover, we provide a method to build an ambiguity set of admissible probability measures that can be derived from observed market data. Thus, the approach can be considered as being model-free and entirely data-driven.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于深度神经网络的方法，可以在金融市场中识别出稳健的统计套利策略。稳健的统计套利策略指的是在模型不确定性下实现盈利交易的交易策略。这一创新方法允许同时考虑大量基础证券，并不依赖于资产协整对的识别，因此适用于高维金融市场或在传统对冲交易方法失败的市场。此外，我们提供了一种从观察市场数据中得到的可容许概率测度的模糊集构建方法。因此，该方法可被认为是无模型且完全数据驱动的。我们通过提供具有高盈利交易表现的实证研究展示了我们方法的适用性，甚至在50维度的情况下也表现出色。",
