    "abstract": "We consider the nonstochastic multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with agents collaborating via a communication network with delays. We show a lower bound for individual regret of all agents. We show that with suitable regularizers and communication protocols, a collaborative multi-agent \\emph{follow-the-regularized-leader} (FTRL) algorithm has an individual regret upper bound that matches the lower bound up to a constant factor when the number of arms is large enough relative to degrees of agents in the communication graph. We also show that an FTRL algorithm with a suitable regularizer is regret optimal with respect to the scaling with the edge-delay parameter. We present numerical experiments validating our theoretical results and demonstrate cases when our algorithms outperform previously proposed algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了一个具有延迟通信网络的合作非随机多智能体多臂老虎机问题。我们证明了所有智能体的个体后悔的下界。我们证明当臂的数量相对于通信图中智能体的度数足够大时，采用适当的正则化器和通信协议，合作多个智能体的\"FTRL\"算法的个体后悔上界与下界相匹配，最多仅相差一个常数因子。我们还证明了一个具有适当正则化器的\"FTRL\"算法相对于边延迟参数的缩放具有后悔最优性。我们提供了数值实验来验证我们的理论结果，并展示了我们的算法优于先前提出的算法的情况。",
