This problem, which we call Quantile Set Inversion (QSI), occurs for instance in the context of robust (reliability-based) optimization problems, when looking for the set of solutions that satisfy the constraints with sufficiently large probability. To solve the QSI problem, we propose a Bayesian strategy based on Gaussian process modeling and the Stepwise Uncertainty Reduction (SUR) principle, to sequentially choose the points at which the function should be evaluated to efficiently approximate the set of interest. We illustrate the performance and interest of the proposed SUR strategy through several numerical experiment",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一个未知的多元函数，它代表着一个系统，如一个复杂的数值模拟器，同时具有确定性和不确定性的输入。我们的目标是估计确定性输入集，这些输入导致的输出（就不确定性输入的分布而言）属于给定集合的概率小于给定阈值。这个问题被称为量化集反演（QSI），例如在稳健（基于可靠性）优化问题的背景下，当寻找满足约束条件且具有足够大概率的解集时会发生。为了解决QSI问题，我们提出了一种基于高斯过程建模和逐步不确定性减少（SUR）原理的贝叶斯策略，以顺序选择应该评估函数的点，以便高效近似感兴趣的集合。通过几个数值实验，我们展示了所提出的SUR策略的性能和价值",
