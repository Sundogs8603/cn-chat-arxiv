    "translated_abstract": "广义类别发现（GCD）的目标是从一组无标签数据中识别已知和新的类别，基于另一个仅带有已知类别的数据集。目前的方法忽略已知和新类别之间的差异，在耦合的方式下学习它们，这可能会损害模型的泛化和区分能力。此外，耦合训练方法阻止这些模型显式地从标记数据向未标记数据转移类别特定的知识，这可能会丢失高级语义信息并影响模型性能。为了减轻上述限制，我们提出了一种新颖的模型，称为解耦原型网络（DPN）。通过为类别原型制定一个二分图匹配问题，DPN不仅可以解耦已知和新的类别以有效地实现不同的训练目标，而且还可以将标记和未标记数据中的已知类别对齐，以显式地转移类别特定的知识并捕获高水平的语义信息。",
