    "translated_abstract": "主动投资组合管理试图将任何有意义的信息源整合到资产选择过程中。在本文中，我们考虑定性观点，将其规定为预期资产回报的总体排序，并讨论两种不同的方法来将此输入纳入均值方差投资组合优化模型中。在鲁棒优化方法中，我们首先通过扩展Black-Litterman（BL）框架计算每个给定总排序的资产预期回报的后验期望。然后，将这些预期资产回报作为鲁棒优化变体的可能输入场景，应用于均值方差投资组合模型（最大-最小鲁棒性、最小遗憾鲁棒性和软鲁棒性）。在顺序聚合方法中，使用社会选择理论中的规则（Borda、Footrule、Copeland、Best-of-k和MC4）将总排序聚合为单个“共识总排序”。然后，针对这个“共识总排序”计算预期资产回报。",
