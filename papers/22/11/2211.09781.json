A simple approach is to ignore CMI and monitor only the untreated patients, whose outcomes remain unaltered. In general, ignoring CMI may inflate Type I error because (i) untreated patients disproportionally represent those with low predicted risk and (ii) evolution in both the model and clinician trust in the model can induce complex dependencies that violate standard assumptions. Nevertheless, we show that valid inference is still possible if one monitors conditional performance and if either conditional exchangeability or time-constant selection bias hold. Specifically, we develop a new score-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) m",
