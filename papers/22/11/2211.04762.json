    "abstract": "Based on classical contagion models we introduce an artificial cyber lab: the digital twin of a complex cyber system in which possible cyber resilience measures may be implemented and tested. Using the lab, in numerical case studies, we identify two classes of measures to control systemic cyber risks: security- and topology-based interventions. We discuss the implications of our findings on selected real-world cybersecurity measures currently applied in the insurance and regulation practice or under discussion for future cyber risk control. To this end, we provide a brief overview of the current cybersecurity regulation and emphasize the role of insurance companies as private regulators. Moreover, from an insurance point of view, we provide first attempts to design systemic cyber risk obligations and to measure the systemic risk contribution of individual policyholders.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于传统的传染模型，我们引入了一个人工网络实验室：一个复杂网络系统的数字孪生，可以在其中实施和测试可能的网络安全措施。通过数字实验，在数值案例研究中，我们确定了两类措施来控制系统性网络风险：安全和拓扑基础的干预。我们讨论了我们研究结果对当前应用于保险和监管实践或未来网络风险控制的一些真实世界网络安全措施的影响。为此，我们提供了当前网络安全规定的简要概述，并强调保险公司作为私人监管机构的角色。此外，从保险角度出发，我们提供了第一次尝试设计系统性网络风险义务，并衡量个人保单持有人对系统性风险的贡献。",
