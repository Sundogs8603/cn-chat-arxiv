    "translated_abstract": "经典人工神经网络已在机器学习领域取得了广泛成功。本文提出了一种费米子神经网络（FNN），其物理特性（例如局部态密度或条件电导）在输入作为初始层后作为输出。与反向传播类似，我们建立了一种高效优化方法，使FNN在具有挑战性的机器学习基准测试上表现出竞争性能。FNN也直接应用于量子系统，包括具有相互作用的硬系统，并在无预处理或假设的情况下提供原位分析。在机器学习之后，FNN精确地确定拓扑相和紧凑电荷序。它们的量子特性也带来了各种优势：量子相关性使网络连接更加通用，并且可以深入了解消失的梯度问题，量子纠缠则为可解释的机器学习打开了新的途径等。",
