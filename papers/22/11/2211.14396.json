Methods: For this retrospective, single-centre study, radiomic features were extracted from Regions of Interest (ROIs) on CT images of patients who underwent simultaneous liver biopsy and CT examinations. Combinations of contrast, normalization, machine learning model, and feature selection method were determined based on their mean test Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) on randomly placed ROIs. The combination and selected features with the highest AUC were used to develop a final liver fibrosis screening model.   Results: The study included 101 male and 68 female patients (mean age = 51.2 years $\\pm$ 14.7 [SD]). When averaging the AUC across all combinations, non-contrast enhanced (NC) CT (AUC, 0.6100; 95% CI: 0.5897, 0.6303) outperformed contrast-enhanced CT (AUC, 0.5680; 95% CI",
