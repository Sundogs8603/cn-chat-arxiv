    "translated_abstract": "解决现实世界中的操纵任务需要机器人具备适用于各种情况的技能库。使用基于学习的方法获得这种技能的关键挑战是获取覆盖任务的多样性和可行性的训练数据，这通常需要非常复杂的手动劳动和领域知识。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一种名为主动任务随机化（ATR）的方法，通过无监督生成训练任务来学习鲁棒的技能。 ATR通过平衡任务的多样性和可行性，选择适合学习鲁棒技能的任务，其中包括初始环境状态和操作目标。我们提出通过共同学习紧凑任务表示来预测任务多样性和可行性。然后使用基于图的参数化在模拟中程序生成所选的任务。这些训练任务的主动选择使得使用我们的框架训练的技能策略能够在不需要大量手动注释或领域知识的情况下，鲁棒地处理任务的各种情况，包括以前未见过的场景。",
