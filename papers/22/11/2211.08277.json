    "translated_abstract": "预测疾病的发展是具有挑战性的，尤其是当数据可用性有限和不完整时。最受欢迎的建模和预测传染病流行的工具是隔离模型。它们将人群根据健康状况分成不同的隔离群体，并使用动力系统模型来描述这些隔离群体的动态。然而，由于疾病传播和人类互动的复杂性，这些预定义系统可能无法捕捉流行病的真实动态。为了克服这个缺点，我们提出了基于稀疏性和时滞嵌入的流行病预测（SPADE4）。SPADE4预测可观察变量的未来轨迹，而不需要其他变量或基础系统的知识。我们使用具有稀疏回归的随机特征模型来处理数据稀缺问题，并采用Takens的时滞嵌入定理，从观察变量中捕捉基础系统的性质。",
