    "translated_abstract": "图谱是生成不同大小的图表的通用且强大的模型。本文提出使用神经网络直接对图谱进行建模，得到隐式图谱神经表示法 (IGNR)。现有工作在建模和重构图谱时常通过固定分辨率分段常数表示来逼近目标图谱。我们的IGNR具有一定的优势，可以表示任意分辨率的图谱，并在学习模型后能够自然高效地生成具有所需结构的任意大小的图表。此外，通过利用Gromov-Wasserstein距离，我们允许输入图数据不对齐且具有不同的大小。我们首先通过展示在图谱学习任务上的优异性能来证明我们模型的有效性。然后我们提出了IGNR的扩展，可以被整合到自编码器框架中，并在更一般的图谱学习场景下展示其良好的性能。",
