    "translated_abstract": "缺失数据的比率通常会因记录政策而变化，即使基础特征相对稳定，这种情况可能在不同的时间和地点发生变化。本文介绍了缺失数据转移下的领域自适应问题(DAMS)。在这里，(有标签的)源数据和(无标签的)目标数据可以互换，但存在不同的缺失数据机制。我们展示了，如果缺失数据指标是可用的，DAMS就会归结为协变量转移。针对这种指标不可用的情况，我们为基于完全随机下报告的讨论提供了以下理论结果：(i)协变量转移被违反了(需要适应)；(ii)与总是预测均值相比，最优的线性源预测器在目标域上的表现可能会变得更糟；(iii)即使缺失率本身无法确定，也能够识别出最优的目标预测器；(iv)对于线性模型，一个简单的分析调整可以得到最优参数的一致估计。",
