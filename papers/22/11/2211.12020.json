    "translated_abstract": "缓解气候危机需要快速向低碳能源转变。催化剂材料在许多工业过程中的电化学反应中起着至关重要的作用，如可再生能源储存和电荷合成。为了减少在这些过程中消耗的能量，我们必须快速发现更有效的催化剂来驱动电化学反应。机器学习（ML）有潜力从大量数据中高效地模拟材料的性质，从而加速电催化剂的设计。为此，Open Catalyst Project OC20数据集已经被构建。然而，大多数已经在OC20上训练的现有ML模型仍然无法满足实际应用的可扩展性和准确性要求。在这里，我们提出了几个任务特定的创新，适用于大多数体系结构，可以增加计算效率和精度。特别是我们在图翻译层、图注意力层和池化层中提出了改进。我们将这种方法称为Physical Attribute Scaling Transformer (PhAST)。我们证明了PhAST在生成准确数据的同时，具有低计算成本，适用于几个相关应用，包括电催化剂的发现和设计。",
