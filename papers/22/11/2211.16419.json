    "translated_abstract": "为了减少温室气体排放，许多国家计划大规模扩建风电和太阳能光伏发电容量。这些可变的可再生能源需要电力部门具备更高的灵活性。通过互连可以实现地理平衡，电力存储也可以提供此种灵活性。在一个由十二个中欧国家构成的100%可再生能源场景中，我们研究了跨国地理平衡如何减少电力储存的需要。我们的主要贡献是从因素分解的角度分离并量化了各种因素的影响。应用容量扩展模型和因子分解方法，通过不同的因素：国家的太阳能光伏和风力发电可用性模式、负载曲线以及水力发电和生物能源容量组合来解开互连对于最佳储存能力的影响。结果显示，与仅具有存储但不具有互连的场景相比，互连可将存储需求降低约30%。储存需求的降低是由于欧洲不同地区的风和太阳能的互补发电轮廓。这表明在区域之间进一步发展互联能极大地降低100%可再生能源系统的成本。",

    "en_tdlr": "In a 100% renewable energy scenario of twelve central European countries, the study found that cross-border geographical balancing can reduce storage needs by around 30% due to the complementary generation profiles of wind and solar in different regions of Europe. Further interconnection between regions can significantly reduce the cost of a 100% renewable power system."
