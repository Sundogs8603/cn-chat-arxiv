    "translated_abstract": "运动分析已经吸引了越来越多的关注，因为对各种数据的分析可以为训练策略、球员评估等提供洞察。本文着重于预测返回技能的类型以及基于前一次击球球员将移动到哪里。由于此问题尚未得到解决，因此可以通过将其构造为序列预测任务，并且采用基于序列和基于图形的模型来解决移动预测问题。然而，现有的基于序列的模型忽略了球员之间交互的影响，基于图形的模型仍然存在关于下一次移动的多方面观点。此外，还没有现有工作可以表示球员射击类型和移动之间的战略关系。为了解决这些挑战，我们首先介绍了球员移动图（PM）图的过程，以利用具有战略关系的球员的结构移动。基于PM图，我们提出了一种新颖的动态图和层次融合（DGHF）模型，用于预测羽毛球比赛中的球员移动。DGHF模型将基于序列的模型和基于图形的模型相结合，并具有一个层次融合层，以考虑时空依赖性。实验结果表明了所提出方法在真实数据上的有效性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes a novel Dynamic Graphs and Hierarchical Fusion (DGHF) model to predict player movements in badminton matches. The DGHF model integrates both sequence-based and graph-based models, with a hierarchical fusion layer to consider both spatial and temporal dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on real-world data."
