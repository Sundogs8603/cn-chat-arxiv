    "translated_abstract": "与权重一样，偏置项也是许多流行的机器学习模型(包括神经网络)可学习的参数。人们认为偏差能有效地增加神经网络表示能力来解决计算机视觉中的各种任务。然而，我们认为，如果我们从第一原理考虑图像在输入空间中的内在分布以及模型应具有的一些期望特性，则偏差可以完全忽略，以解决许多与图像相关的任务，例如图像分类任务。我们的观察结果表明，零偏置神经网络在实际图像分类任务上可能与带偏置的神经网络表现相当。此外，我们证明零偏置神经网络具有称为标量(乘法)不变性的良好属性，这使得当改变输入图像的对比度时，神经网络的预测保持不变。然后，我们将标量不变性扩展到更一般的情况…",
