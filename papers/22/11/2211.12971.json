    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2211.12971v2 公告类型: 替换-交叉 摘要: 在机械领域，基于最近的机器学习进展，特别是人工神经网络，数据驱动建模正快速发展。随着这一领域不断成熟，不同研究团队创建的新数据和模型陆续问世，为合作建模开辟了可能性。然而，人工神经网络存在灾难性遗忘，即当在新任务上训练时忘记如何执行旧任务。这种情况阻碍了合作，因为使现有模型适应新任务会影响他人训练的先前任务的性能。作者们开发了一种持续学习方法来解决这个问题，在此首次将其应用于固体力学。具体来说，该方法应用于循环神经网络来预测历史相关的塑性行为，尽管它也可以用于任何其他架构（前馈、卷积等）和预测其他现象。",
