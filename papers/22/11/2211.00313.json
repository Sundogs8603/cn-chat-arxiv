    "abstract": "Purpose: Self-supervised learning is rapidly advancing computer-aided diagnosis in the medical field. Masked image modeling (MIM) is one of the self-supervised learning methods that masks a subset of input pixels and attempts to predict the masked pixels.

Methods: In this study, we propose a novel region-guided masked image modeling method (RGMIM) for COVID-19 detection in this paper.

    "translated_abstract": "目的：自监督学习正在快速推进医学领域的计算机辅助诊断。掩膜图像建模（MIM）是一种自监督学习方法，它掩盖了一组输入像素并试图预测遮盖的像素。传统的MIM方法通常采用随机掩膜策略。与普通图像相比，医学图像往往具有用于疾病检测的小区域。因此，我们在本文中专注于解决这个问题，在自动COVID-19识别方面进行评估。方法：本文提出了一种新颖的区域引导的掩膜图像建模方法（RGMIM）用于COVID-19检测。在我们的方法中，我们设计了一种新的掩膜策略，利用肺掩模信息来识别有效区域，以学习更有用的COVID-19检测信息。我们将所提出的方法与五种自监督学习技术（MAE，SKD，Cross，BYOL和SimSiam）进行对比。我们提出了定量评估。",
