    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱嵌入 (KGE) 旨在学习强大的表示以受益于各种人工智能应用。与此同时，对比学习已被广泛利用于图学习，作为增强所学表示的可区分能力的有效机制。然而，KG的复杂结构使得构建适当的对比对变得困难。为数不多的几个尝试将对比学习策略与KGE集成。但是，它们大多依赖于语言模型（例如Bert）进行对比对构建，而不是完全挖掘潜在的图结构信息，从而阻碍了表达能力。令人惊讶的是，我们发现关系对称结构内的实体通常相似且相关。因此，我们提出了一种基于关系对称结构的知识图谱对比学习框架，KGE-SymCL，它在KG中挖掘对称结构信息以增强所学表示的区分能力。",
