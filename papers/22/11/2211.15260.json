    "abstract": "Investments in cryptocurrencies (CCs) remain risky due to high volatility. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are a suitable tool to diversify risk and to benefit from the growth of the whole CC sector. We construct an ETF on the CRIX, the CRyptocurrency IndeX that maps the non-stationary CC dynamics closely by adapting its constituents weights dynamically. The scenario analysis considers the fee schedules of regulated CC exchanges, spreads obtained from high-frequency order book data, and models capital deposits to the ETF stochastically. The analysis yields valuable insights into the mechanisms, costs and risks of this new financial product: i) although the composition of the CRIX ETF changes frequently (from 5 to 30 constituents), it remains robust in its core, as the weights of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are robust over time, ii) on average, a portion of 5.2% needed to be rebalanced at the rebalancing dates, iii) trading costs are low compared to traditional assets, iv) the liquidi",
