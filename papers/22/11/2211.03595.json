The denoising diffusion relies on approximations of the logarithmic derivatives of the noised data densities using score matching.

    "translated_abstract": "去噪扩散是展现出卓越实验性能的最先进的生成模型。他们通过将数据分布扩散到高斯分布，然后学习逆转这个噪声过程以获取合成数据点。去噪扩散依赖于使用分数匹配对噪声数据密度的对数导数的逼近。当只能从先验分布和似然函数中进行抽样时，这种模型也可用于执行近似后验模拟。我们提出了一个统一框架，将此方法推广到一类广泛的空间，并导致分数匹配的原始扩展。我们通过各种应用程序说明了所得模型。",
