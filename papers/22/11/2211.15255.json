    "abstract": "Recently, graph anomaly detection on attributed networks has attracted growing attention in data mining and machine learning communities. Apart from attribute anomalies, graph anomaly detection also aims at suspicious topological-abnormal nodes that exhibit collective anomalous behavior. Closely connected uncorrelated node groups form uncommonly dense substructures in the network. However, existing methods overlook that the topology anomaly detection performance can be improved by recognizing such a collective pattern. To this end, we propose a new graph anomaly detection framework on attributed networks via substructure awareness (ARISE for abbreviation). Unlike previous algorithms, we focus on the substructures in the graph to discern abnormalities. Specifically, we establish a region proposal module to discover high-density substructures in the network as suspicious regions. The average node-pair similarity can be regarded as the topology anomaly degree of nodes within substructures",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，属性网络上的图像异常检测引起了数据挖掘和机器学习社区的广泛关注。除了属性异常外，图像异常检测还旨在检测表现出集体异常行为的具有可疑拓扑异常的节点。紧密连接的不相关节点组在网络中形成异常密集的子结构。然而，现有方法忽视了通过识别这种集体模式，可以提高拓扑异常检测性能的事实。为此，我们提出了一种基于属性网络的图像异常检测框架，通过子结构认知（简称ARISE）。与以往的算法不同，我们的重点是识别图中的子结构以辨别异常。具体而言，我们建立了一个区域提案模块，以发现网络中的高密度子结构作为可疑区域。节点对相似度的平均值可被视为子结构内节点的拓扑异常程度。",
