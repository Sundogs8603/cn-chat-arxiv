    "abstract": "When reading a story, humans can quickly understand new fictional characters with a few observations, mainly by drawing analogies to fictional and real people they already know. This reflects the few-shot and meta-learning essence of humans' inference of characters' mental states, i.e., theory-of-mind (ToM), which is largely ignored in existing research. We fill this gap with a novel NLP dataset, ToM-in-AMC, the first assessment of machines' meta-learning of ToM in a realistic narrative understanding scenario. Our dataset consists of ~1,000 parsed movie scripts, each corresponding to a few-shot character understanding task that requires models to mimic humans' ability of fast digesting characters with a few starting scenes in a new movie.   We propose a novel ToM prompting approach designed to explicitly assess the influence of multiple ToM dimensions. It surpasses existing baseline models, underscoring the significance of modeling multiple ToM dimensions for our task. Our extensive hu",

    "translated_abstract": "在阅读故事时，人类可以通过将其与他们已经了解的虚构和真实人物进行类比，迅速理解新的虚构角色。这反映了人类对角色内心状态（即心智模型）的推理中少样本和元学习的本质，现有研究在这方面很大程度上被忽视了。我们通过提供一个新颖的NLP数据集ToM-in-AMC来填补这一空白，这是第一个以现实叙事理解场景为背景的机器元学习心智模型评价。我们的数据集包含约1000个分析过的电影剧本，每个剧本对应于一个需要模型模仿人类快速理解新电影中的角色的少样本情感理解任务。",
