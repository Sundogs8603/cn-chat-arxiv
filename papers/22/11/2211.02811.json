    "abstract": "Analytical explorations on complex networks and cubes (i.e., multi-dimensional datasets) are currently two separate research fields with different strategies. To gain more insights into cube dynamics via unique network-domain methodologies and to obtain abundant synthetic networks, we need a transformation approach from cubes into associated networks. To this end, we propose FGM, a fast generic model converting cubes into interrelated networks, whereby samples are remodeled into nodes and network dynamics are guided under the concept of nearest-neighbor searching. Through comparison with previous models, we show that FGM can cost-efficiently generate networks exhibiting typical patterns more closely aligned to factual networks, such as more authentic degree distribution, power-law average nearest-neighbor degree dependency, and the influence decay phenomenon we consider vital for networks. Furthermore, we evaluate the networks that FGM generates through various cubes. Results show that",

    "translated_abstract": "复杂网络分析和立方体（即多维数据集）的探索是两个当前不同策略的独立研究领域。为了通过独特的网络域方法获得关于立方体动态的更多洞察，并获得丰富的合成网络，我们需要一种将立方体转化为相应网络的转化方法。为此，我们提出了FGM，一种快速通用模型，将样本重塑为节点，并在最近邻概念的指导下引导网络动态。通过与以前模型的比较，我们显示出FGM可以高效地生成更接近实际网络的典型模式的网络，例如更真实的度分布、幂律平均最近邻度依赖性，以及我们认为对于网络至关重要的影响衰减现象。此外，我们通过各种立方体评估FGM生成的网络。结果表明，",
