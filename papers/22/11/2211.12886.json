    "translated_abstract": "从平面截面重建三维形状是医学影像学和地理信息学等下游应用的挑战。输入是完全定义在空间中稀疏的平面集合上的内/外指示函数，输出是指示函数到整个体积的插值。以前解决这个稀疏和不适定问题的作品要么产生低质量的结果，要么依赖于额外的先验知识，如目标拓扑、外观信息或输入法向方向。在本文中，我们提出了OReX，一种仅使用切片即可进行三维形状重建的方法，其特点是以神经场作为插值先验。一个简单的神经网络被用来训练输入平面，以返回给定3D坐标的内/外估计，从而产生了强大的先验，能够诱导平滑性和自相似性。这种方法的主要挑战是高频细节，因为神经先验会过于平滑。为了缓解这一问题，我们提供了一种新颖的方法。",
