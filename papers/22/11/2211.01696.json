Analyzing several large public datasets, we show that simple linear models do represent real-world trajectories with high fidelity over relevant time scales at very moderate model complexity. This finding allows the formulation of trajectory tracking and prediction as a Bayesian filtering problem. Using an Empirical Bayes approach, we estimate prior distributions over model parameters from the data. These prior distributions inform the motion models necessary in the trajectory tracking problem and can help regularize prediction models. We argue for the use of linear trajectory representation models in trajectory prediction tasks as they do not limit prediction performance currently.",
