Due to its relevance for runtime safety assurance and online control, PM methods need to be efficient to enable timely interventions against predicted violations, while providing correctness guarantees. We introduce \\textit{quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM)}, the first PM method to support stochastic processes and rich specifications given in Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Unlike most of the existing PM techniques that predict whether or not some property $\\phi$ is satisfied, QPM provides a quantitative measure of satisfaction by predicting the quantitative (aka robust) STL semantics of $\\phi$.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究考虑了预测监控（PM）的问题，即从当前系统状态预测所需属性的满足情况。由于其对于运行时安全保障和在线控制的重要性，PM方法需要高效，以便能够在预测到违规时及时进行干预，同时提供正确性保证。我们引入了“定量预测监控（QPM）”，这是第一个支持STL中的随机过程和丰富规范的PM方法。与大多数现有的PM技术通过预测是否满足某些属性$\\phi$不同，QPM通过预测$\\phi$的定量（也称为鲁棒性）STL语义来量化满足程度。QPM导出了高效计算且具有概率保证的预测区间，在概率上覆盖了与系统随机演化相关的STL鲁棒性值。",
