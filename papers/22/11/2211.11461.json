    "translated_abstract": "符号回归（SR）算法尝试学习精确适合数据的解析表达式，并以高度可解释的方式呈现。传统SR存在两个基本问题，我们在此处加以解决。首先，这些方法随机地搜索空间（通常使用遗传编程），因此不一定找到最佳函数。其次，用于选择最优方程的标准在精度和简洁性之间平衡时是可变和主观的。为了解决这些问题，我们介绍了全面的符号回归（ESR），它系统地和高效地考虑所有可能的方程——使用给定的算子基础集和最大复杂度——因此，如果参数完美优化，则保证找到真正的最优解和在这些约束条件下的完整函数排名。我们实现了最小描述长度原则作为将这些偏好合并为单个目标的严格方法。",
