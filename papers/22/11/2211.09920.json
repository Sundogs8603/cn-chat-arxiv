    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑使用深度联合源—信道编码（DeepJSCC）在噪声多址信道（MAC）上进行分布式图像传输。已知在渐近无限长度块的情况下，香农的分离定理成立，用于传输独立的源。然而，我们关注的是实际有限长度块的情况，在这种情况下，单独的源编码和信道编码被认为是次优的。我们引入了一种新颖的联合图像压缩和传输方案，其中设备以非正交的方式发送它们的压缩图像表示。虽然非正交多址接入（NOMA）已知可以达到容量区域，但据我们所知，非正交联合源信道编码（JSCC）方案在实际系统中尚未进行深入研究。通过大量实验，我们展示了与采用当前的DeepJSCC方法进行正交传输相比，重建图像质量方面的显著改善。",
