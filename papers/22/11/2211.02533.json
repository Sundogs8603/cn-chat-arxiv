    "translated_title": "一种基于Transformer的替代品推荐模型，融合了弱监督的顾客行为数据",
    "translated_abstract": "基于替代品的推荐在电子商务中得到广泛应用，以提供更好的替代品给顾客。但是现有研究通常使用顾客的行为信号（如共同浏览和浏览但购买另一个产品）来捕捉替代关系。尽管这个方法听起来很直观，但我们发现这种做法可能会忽略产品的功能和特性。在本文中，我们通过以产品标题描述作为模型输入，并考虑产品功能，将替代品推荐适应到语言匹配问题中。我们设计了一种新的转换方法来去除从生产数据中得出的信号噪声。此外，我们从工程角度考虑多语言支持。我们提出的端到端基于Transformer的模型在离线和在线实验中均取得了成功。所提出的模型已部署在一个大型电子商务网站上的11个市场和6种语言中。我们的模型被证明可以提高顾客忠诚度和购买率。",
