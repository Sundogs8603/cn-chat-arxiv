    "translated_abstract": "随着计算能力的快速增长和深度学习的最新进展，我们在研究环境中见证了新型机器人能力的令人印象深刻的展示。然而，这些学习系统表现出脆弱的泛化能力，并且在实际任务中需要大量训练数据。为了利用最先进的机器人学习模型的能力，同时接受它们的不完美性，我们提出了Sirius，一个为人类和机器人通过分工合作而设计的原则性框架。在这个框架中，部分自主的机器人负责处理大部分决策工作，在这些工作中它们能可靠地工作；与此同时，人类操作员监控这个过程，并在挑战性情况下进行干预。这样的人机团队确保了复杂任务的安全部署。此外，我们引入了一种新的学习算法来改进从任务执行中收集的数据对策略的性能的影响。核心思想是使用近似人类行为的样本对训练样本进行重新加权。",
