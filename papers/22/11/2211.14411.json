    "abstract": "Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is crucial for strong performance of deep learning algorithms and real-world applications often impose some constraints, such as memory usage, or latency on top of the performance requirement. In this work, we propose constrained TPE (c-TPE), an extension of the widely-used versatile Bayesian optimization method, tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE), to handle these constraints. Our proposed extension goes beyond a simple combination of an existing acquisition function and the original TPE, and instead includes modifications that address issues that cause poor performance. We thoroughly analyze these modifications both empirically and theoretically, providing insights into how they effectively overcome these challenges. In the experiments, we demonstrate that c-TPE exhibits the best average rank performance among existing methods with statistical significance on 81 expensive HPO settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "超参数优化（HPO）对于深度学习算法的强大性能至关重要，实际应用通常会在性能要求之上施加一些限制，例如内存使用或延迟等。在本文中，我们提出了约束TPE（c-TPE），这是广泛使用的多功能贝叶斯优化方法——树形Parzen估计器（TPE）的扩展，以处理这些约束。我们提出的扩展不仅是简单地将现有收益函数和原始TPE组合起来，而是包括修改来解决导致性能不佳的问题。我们从经验和理论上深入分析这些修改，提供了有关它们如何有效地克服这些挑战的见解。在实验中，我们证明了c-TPE在81个昂贵的HPO设置中表现出最佳的平均排名性能，具有统计显着性。",
