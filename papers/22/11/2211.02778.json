    "translated_abstract": "在高维变量选择问题中，统计学家通常致力于设计能控制虚警发现率（FDR）的多重检验过程，同时识别更多相关变量。模型-X方法（如Knockoffs和条件随机化检验）在假设已知协变量分布的情况下，实现了有限样本FDR控制的主要目标。然而，这些方法是否还能实现最大化发现的次要目标仍不确定。事实上，设计具有有限样本FDR控制并发现更多相关变量的程序，在可能是最简单的线性模型中，仍然是一个基本开放问题。本文针对高维贝叶斯线性模型与各向同性协变量，开发了接近最优的多重检验程序。我们引入了能在有限样本下保证频率FDR控制的模型-X程序，即使模型被错误指定，也能达到近似最优功率。",
