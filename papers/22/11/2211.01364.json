    "translated_abstract": "我们建立了随机最优控制与基于随机微分方程（SDE）的生成模型之间的联系，例如最近发展起来的扩散概率模型。特别地，我们推导出一个汉密尔顿-雅可比-贝尔曼方程，用于控制潜在的SDE边际密度的演化。这个视角允许将最优控制理论的方法应用于生成建模中。首先，我们展示了证据下界是控制理论中广为人知的验证定理的直接结果。此外，我们可以将基于扩散的生成建模表述为路径空间中合适度量之间的Kullback-Leibler散度的最小化。最后，我们开发了一种从非归一化密度中进行采样的新型扩散方法，这在统计学和计算科学中经常出现的问题。我们证明了我们的时序反向扩散采样器（DIS）可以胜过其他基于扩散的采样方法。",
