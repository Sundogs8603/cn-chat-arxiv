This study investigates the possibility of learning and utilising a system's Hamiltonian and its variational thermal state estimation for data analysis techniques. For this purpose, we employ the method of Quantum Hamiltonian-Based Models for the generative modelling of simulated Large Hadron Collider data and demonstrate the representability of such data as a mixed state. In a further step, we use the learned Hamiltonian for anomaly detection, showing that different sample types can form distinct dynamical behaviours once treated as a quantum many-body system. We exploit these characteristics to quantify the difference between sample types.
