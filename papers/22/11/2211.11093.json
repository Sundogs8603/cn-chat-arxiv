For instance, to understand a field, e.g., computer science, we need to understand the relevant concepts, e.g., machine learning, and the relationships between concepts, e.g., machine learning and artificial intelligence. To understand a person, we should first know who he/she is and how he/she is related to others. To understand entities and relations, humans may refer to natural language descriptions. For instance, when learning a new scientific term, people usually start by reading its definition in dictionaries or encyclopedias. To know the relationship between two entities, humans tend to create a sentence to connect them. In this paper, we propose [RE]VER: A Unified Model for Verbalizing Entities and Relations.

    "translated_abstract": "实体及实体之间的关系是现实世界中至关重要的。人们通过理解实体和关系来了解世界。本文提出了一种名为[RE]VER的系统，通过使用基于transformer的模型来学习实体和关系的自然语言表示，并生成一个能够表示实体与其他实体关系的句子。我们在多个基准数据集上评估了我们的模型，并证明其相比于之前的最先进方法有了显著改进。",

It shows significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods."
