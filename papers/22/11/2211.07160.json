    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）是一种分布式机器学习范式，允许多个客户端协同训练一个全局模型，而无需共享他们的本地数据。然而，FL需要将模型暴露给各种参与者，这可能导致恶意客户端未经授权地分发或转售模型，从而损害FL团队的知识产权。为了阻止这种不当行为，建立一种验证模型所有权并追溯泄露者的机制至关重要。本文提出了FedTracker，这是第一个提供所有权验证和可追溯性的FL模型保护框架。FedTracker采用双层保护方案，包括全局水印机制和本地指纹机制。前者用于验证全局模型的所有权，而后者用于识别该模型来自哪个客户端。FedTracker利用持续学习（CL）原则来提高模型的保护性能。",
