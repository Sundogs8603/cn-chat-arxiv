    "abstract": "Personalization in Federated Learning (FL) aims to modify a collaboratively trained global model according to each client. Current approaches to personalization in FL are at a coarse granularity, i.e. all the input instances of a client use the same personalized model. This ignores the fact that some instances are more accurately handled by the global model due to better generalizability. To address this challenge, this work proposes Flow, a fine-grained stateless personalized FL approach. Flow creates dynamic personalized models by learning a routing mechanism that determines whether an input instance prefers the local parameters or its global counterpart. Thus, Flow introduces per-instance routing in addition to leveraging per-client personalization to improve accuracies at each client. Further, Flow is stateless which makes it unnecessary for a client to retain its personalized state across FL rounds. This makes Flow practical for large-scale FL settings and friendly to newly joined",

    "translated_abstract": "个性化联合学习旨在根据每个客户端对协作训练的全局模型进行修改。目前的个性化联合学习方法在粗粒度上进行，即客户端的所有输入实例使用相同的个性化模型。这忽视了某些实例由于更好的泛化能力而更准确地处理全局模型的事实。为了解决这个挑战，本文提出了一种细粒度无状态个性化联合学习方法Flow。Flow通过学习一种路由机制，创建动态的个性化模型，确定输入实例是更喜欢本地参数还是全局对应参数。因此，Flow除了利用每个客户端的个性化之外，还引入了每个实例的路由，以提高每个客户端的准确性。此外，Flow是无状态的，使得客户端在联合学习轮之间不必保留个性化状态。这使得Flow适用于大规模联合学习环境，并且对新加入的客户端友好。",
