We propose a solution by defining the denoising diffusion model in the function space which also allows us to naturally handle irregularly-sampled observations. The forward process gradually adds noise to functions, preserving their continuity, while the learned reverse process removes the noise and returns functions as new samples. To this end, we define suitable noise sources and introduce novel denoising and score-matching models. We show how our method can be used for multivariate probabilistic forecasting and imputation, and how our model can be interpreted as a neural process.",

    "translated_abstract": "时间序列等时间数据可以被看作是潜在函数的离散化测量值。为了为这样的数据建立生成模型，我们必须对控制它的随机过程进行建模。我们提出了一种通过在函数空间中定义去噪扩散模型的解决方案，同时也可以自然地处理不规则采样的数据。前向过程逐渐向函数添加噪声，保持其连续性，而学习到的反向过程则移除噪声并返回函数作为新的样本。为此，我们定义了适当的噪声源，并引入了新颖的去噪和分值匹配模型。我们展示了我们的方法如何用于多元概率预测和插补，以及如何将我们的模型解释为神经过程。",
