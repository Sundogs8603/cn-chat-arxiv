    "translated_abstract": "在操作性预测中，对于关键气候变量（如温度和降水）进行高质量的地表季节性时间尺度预测一直存在着差距。最近的研究表明，使用机器学习（ML）模型来推进地表季节性预测（SSF）取得了有希望的结果，但仍存在一些未解的问题。首先，过去的方法中使用了物理基于模型集合的平均作为这些模型的输入特征，然而集合预测中包含了可以帮助预测的信息，不仅仅是集合均值。其次，过去的方法关注平均性能，然而对于计划和减灾目的来说，极端事件的预测更加重要。第三，气候预测对应于一个空间变化的预测集合，而不同的方法以不同的方式考虑了响应的空间可变性。模型堆叠可以缓解不同方法之间的权衡。本文描述了一种利用模型集合进行地表季节性预测的应用。",
