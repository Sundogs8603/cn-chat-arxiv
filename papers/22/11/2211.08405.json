    "abstract": "arXiv:2211.08405v5 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Textual data from financial filings, e.g., the Management's Discussion & Analysis (MDA) section in Form 10-K, has been used to improve the prediction accuracy of bankruptcy models. In practice, however, we cannot obtain the MDA section for all public companies, which limits the use of MDA data in traditional bankruptcy models, as they need complete data to make predictions. The two main reasons for the lack of MDA are: (i) not all companies are obliged to submit the MDA and (ii) technical problems arise when crawling and scrapping the MDA section. To solve this limitation, this research introduces the Conditional Multimodal Discriminative (CMMD) model that learns multimodal representations that embed information from accounting, market, and textual data modalities. The CMMD model needs a sample with all data modalities for model training. At test time, the CMMD model only needs access to accounting and market modalities to gene",

    "translated_abstract": "来自财务报告的文本数据，例如10-K表中的“管理讨论与分析”（MDA）部分，已被用于提高破产模型的预测准确性。然而，在实践中，我们无法为所有上市公司获取MDA部分，这限制了MDA数据在传统破产模型中的使用，因为它们需要完整数据来进行预测。缺少MDA数据的两个主要原因是：（i）并非所有公司都有义务提交MDA，（ii）当爬取和抓取MDA部分时会出现技术问题。为了解决这一限制，该研究引入了条件多模态判别（CMMD）模型，该模型学习多模态表示，嵌入了会计、市场和文本数据模态的信息。CMMD模型需要一组所有数据模态进行模型训练。在测试时，CMMD模型只需要访问会计和市场模态来生成",
