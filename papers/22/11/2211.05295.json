    "translated_abstract": "光伏（PV）行业的持续发展对单晶光伏模块细胞的质量提出了高要求。在学习光伏模块细胞图像中的缺陷区域分割时，微小隐藏裂缝（THC）导致极度不平衡的样本。缺陷像素与正常像素的比例可以低至1：2000。这种极端不平衡使得难以分割光伏模块细胞的THC，也是语义分割的一个挑战。为了解决在极度不平衡的THC数据上进行缺陷分割的问题，本文从三个方面做出了贡献：（1）提出了一个明确的输出不平衡度量方法；（2）推广了一种基于分布的损失函数，可以处理不同类型的输出不平衡；（3）引入了一种复合损失函数和自适应超参数选择算法，可以保持训练和推断的一致性，以实现在极度不平衡输入数据上的输出不平衡的协调。所提出的方法",
