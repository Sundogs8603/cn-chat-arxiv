    "abstract": "Space has been reforming and this evolution brings new threats that, together with technological developments and malicious intent, can pose a major challenge. Space domain awareness (SDA), a new conceptual idea, has come to the forefront. It aims sensing, detection, identification and countermeasures by providing autonomy, intelligence and flexibility against potential threats in space. In this study, we first present an insightful and clear view of the new space. Secondly, we propose an integrated SDA and communication (ISDAC) system for attacker detection. We assume that the attacker has beam-steering antennas and is capable to vary attack scenarios, such as random attacks on some receiver antennas. To track random patterns and meet SDA requirements, a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture is developed. The proposed ISDAC system shows superior and robust performance under 12 different attacker configurations with a detection accuracy of over 97.8%.",

    "translated_abstract": "空间正在发生变革，这种演变带来了新的威胁，加上技术发展和恶意意图，可能构成巨大挑战。空间域感知(SDA)是一个新的概念性想法，其旨在通过提供自主性、智能性和灵活性来实现空间潜在威胁的感知、检测、识别和对策。本研究首先提出一个清晰的新空间视角。其次，我们提出了一个集成的SDA和通信(ISDAC)系统，用于攻击者检测。我们假设攻击者有波束成形天线，并能够变化攻击情景，例如对某些接收天线进行随机攻击。为了跟踪随机模式和满足SDA要求，我们开发了一个轻量级卷积神经网络架构。所提出的ISDAC系统在12种不同的攻击者配置下表现出卓越和稳健的性能，检测精度超过97.8%。",
