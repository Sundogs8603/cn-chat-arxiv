    "translated_abstract": "最近，宏观经济预测开始采用能够处理大规模数据集和不同发布时期系列的技术。MIDAS和DFM是两种允许建模具有非均匀频率的序列的主要现有方法。我们引入了一种新的框架，称为基于水库计算的多频回声状态网络（MFESN）。回声状态网络（ESN）是将递归神经网络公式化为具有随机状态系数的非线性状态空间系统的方法，其中只有观察映射受到估计。与MIDAS模型相反，MFESN要高效得多，允许纳入许多序列，而MIDAS模型容易受到维度诅咒。所有方法在针对美国GDP增长的广泛的多步预测练习中进行比较。我们发现，我们的MFESN模型在性能方面优于或可与其他方法相比，并提供了更好的美国GDP增长率的现货预测。",
