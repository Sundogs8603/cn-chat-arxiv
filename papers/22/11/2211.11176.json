    "translated_abstract": "多元生物信号在许多医学领域中都很普遍，例如脑电图、多导睡眠图和心电图。由于（1）长时间范围内的时间依赖性和（2）电极之间复杂的空间相关性，建立多元生物信号的时空依赖关系模型是具有挑战性的。为了解决这些挑战，我们建议将多元生物信号表示为时间依赖图，并介绍了GraphS4mer，这是一种通用的图神经网络（GNN）结构，通过建立生物信号中的时空依赖关系来提高生物信号分类任务的性能。具体而言，（1）我们利用结构化状态空间架构，一种最先进的深度序列模型，来捕捉生物信号中长时间范围的时间依赖关系，并（2）我们建议在GraphS4mer中添加图结构学习层，以学习数据中动态演变的图结构。我们在三个不同的生物信号分类任务上评估我们的模型，并展示它优于几种基准模型，突显了它在建立具有复杂依赖关系的多元生物信号模型方面的有效性。",
