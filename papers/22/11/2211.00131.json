The neural system largely differs from the loss and gains sides. Five new studies on neurons related to this issue have examined neuronal responses to losses, gains, and reference points. This study investigates a new concept of the value function. A value function with a neuronal cusp may show variations and behavior cusps with catastrophe where a trader closes one's position.",

    "translated_abstract": "在前景理论中，价值函数通常对于收益而言呈凹函数，对于损失而言通常是凸函数，损失的斜率通常比收益的斜率要陡。大脑神经系统在损失和收益方面有很大的不同。本研究对与此问题相关的神经元进行了五项新研究，研究了神经元对损失、收益和参考点的反应。该研究探讨了价值函数的一个新概念。具有神经突的价值函数可能显示出变化和行为突变，导致交易员关闭自己的头寸。",
