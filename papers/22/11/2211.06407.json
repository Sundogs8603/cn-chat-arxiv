From another perspective, under known environments, sampling-based planning can robustly find collision-free paths in environments without learning. In this work, we propose Control Transformer that models return-conditioned sequences from low-level policies guided by a sampling-based Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) planner. We demonstrate that our framework can solve long-horizon navigation tasks using only local information. We evaluate our approach on partially-observed maze navigation with MuJoCo robots, including Ant, Point, and Humanoid. We show that Control Transformer can successfully navigate through mazes and transfer to unknown environments. Additionally, we apply our method to a differential drive robot (Turtlebot3) and show zero-shot sim2real transfer under noisy observations.",

    "translated_abstract": "学习长时间范围的任务，如导航，对于成功应用强化学习到机器人领域提出了困难的挑战。从另一个角度来看，在已知环境下，基于采样的规划可以在不学习的情况下稳健地找到无碰撞路径。在这项工作中，我们提出了Control Transformer，通过由基于采样的概率地图（PRM）规划器引导的低层策略建模返回条件序列。我们证明了我们的框架可以使用仅局部信息解决长时间范围的导航任务。我们在部分观察的迷宫导航中评估了我们的方法，包括Ant，Point和Humanoid的MuJoCo机器人。我们展示了Control Transformer可以成功地在迷宫中导航并转移到未知环境中。此外，我们将我们的方法应用于差分驱动机器人（Turtlebot3），并展示了在噪声观测下的零样本sim2real转移。",
