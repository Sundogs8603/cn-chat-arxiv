    "abstract": "Optimizing user engagement is a key goal for modern recommendation systems, but blindly pushing users towards increased consumption risks burn-out, churn, or even addictive habits. To promote digital well-being, most platforms now offer a service that periodically prompts users to take breaks.

In this paper, we study the role of breaks in recommendation, and propose a framework for learning optimal breaking policies that promote and sustain long-term engagement. Based on the notion that recommendation dynamics are susceptible to both positive and negative feedback, we cast recommendation as a Lotka-Volterra dynamical system, where breaking reduces to a problem of optimal control.

    "translated_abstract": "优化用户参与度是现代推荐系统的一个关键目标，但是盲目地推动用户增加消费会增加燃尽、流失甚至成瘾的风险。为了促进数字福利，现在大多数平台都提供定期提示用户休息的服务，但这些服务必须手动设置，因此可能对用户和系统都不是最优的。在本文中，我们研究了休息在推荐中的作用，并提出了一个框架，用于学习促进和维持长期参与的最优休息策略。基于推荐动态易受到积极和消极反馈的概念，我们将推荐表示为一个 Lotka-Volterra 动态系统，其中休息减少为最优控制问题。我们提出了一种高效的学习算法，提供了理论保证，并在半合成数据上经验性地证明了我们方法的实用性。",
