    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型在各个领域都得到了广泛应用。然而，由于扩散模型需要通过数百到数千次网络评估来模拟由微分方程定义的连续过程，所以其采样过程较慢。在这项工作中，我们使用神经算子，一种高效解决概率流微分方程的方法，来加速扩散模型的采样过程。与其他具有顺序性质的快速采样方法不同，我们首次提出了一种并行解码方法，只需进行一次模型前向传递即可生成图像。我们提出了扩散模型采样与神经算子（DSNO），将初始条件（即高斯分布）映射到逆扩散过程的连续时间解轨迹。为了建模轨迹上的时间相关性，我们将参数化傅立叶空间中的时间卷积层引入给定扩散模型的主干。我们展示了我们的方法的实现。",
