    "translated_abstract": "本文回顾和探讨了人工智能（AI）和深度学习在天文学中的历史发展和未来前景。我们跟踪了天文学中连接主义的三次浪潮的演变，从早期使用多层感知器，到卷积和循环神经网络的崛起，最终到当前的无监督和生成深度学习方法。随着天文数据的呈指数级增长，深度学习技术为揭示有价值的见解和解决以前棘手的问题提供了前所未有的机会。我们提出在进入预期的天文连接主义的第四次浪潮时，采用为天文应用微调的类GPT基础模型。这样的模型可以利用丰富多样的高质量天文数据，为最先进的下游任务提供服务。为了跟上大型科技公司推动的进步，我们提出了在天文社区内采用协作开源方法的建议。",
