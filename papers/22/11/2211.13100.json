These economies feature multiple sectors with faster economic growth than dividend growth. In our two-sector endogenous growth model, entrepreneurs have access to a production technology subject to idiosyncratic investment risk (tech sector) and trade a dividend-paying asset (land). When leverage is relaxed beyond a critical value, the unique trend stationary equilibrium exhibits a phase transition from the fundamental regime to the bubbly regime with growth, implying the inevitability of bubbles with loose financial conditions.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了合理的经济模型，其中存在具有理性资产价格泡沫的均衡，但资产价格等于基本价值的均衡不存在。这些经济体具有比股利增长更快的多个部门的增长。在我们的两部门内生增长模型中，创业者可以获得受特异性投资风险（技术部门）影响的生产技术，并交易支付股息的资产（土地）。当杠杆超过临界值时，唯一的趋势稳态均衡表现出从基本状态到具有增长的泡沫状态的相变，这意味着在宽松的金融条件下泡沫的不可避免性。",
