    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of measuring and predicting how memorable an image is to pattern recognition machines, as a path to explore machine intelligence. Firstly, we propose a self-supervised machine memory quantification pipeline, dubbed ``MachineMem measurer'', to collect machine memorability scores of images. Similar to humans, machines also tend to memorize certain kinds of images, whereas the types of images that machines and humans memorize are different. Through in-depth analysis and comprehensive visualizations, we gradually unveil that``complex\" images are usually more memorable to machines. We further conduct extensive experiments across 11 different machines (from linear classifiers to modern ViTs) and 9 pre-training methods to analyze and understand machine memory. This work proposes the concept of machine memorability and opens a new research direction at the interface between machine memory and visual data.",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文研究了如何测量和预测图像对模式识别机器的记忆性，以探索机器智能。首先，我们提出了一个自监督的机器记忆量化流程，称为“MachineMem measurer”，用于收集图像的机器记忆性分数。与人类类似，机器也倾向于记忆某些类型的图像，但机器和人类记忆的图像类型是不同的。通过深入分析和全面的可视化，我们逐渐揭示了“复杂”图像通常对机器记忆更加深刻。我们进一步在11台不同的机器（从线性分类器到现代ViTs）和9种预训练方法上进行了广泛实验，以分析和理解机器记忆。本研究提出了机器记忆性的概念，并在机器记忆和视觉数据的交叉界面上开辟了一条新的研究方向。",
