    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于机器学习的生成建模在高能物理（HEP）模拟计算方面的应用有了突破性进展。为了在实践中使用这样的替代模拟器，我们需要明确定义的度量标准来比较不同的生成模型，并评估它们与真实分布的差异。本文提出了第一个系统的评估度量标准研究并探讨了它们对失效模式的敏感性以及它们对HEP的相关性和可行性。受物理学和计算机视觉领域以前的工作的启发，我们提出了两个新的度量标准，即Fr\\'echet和核物理距离（FPD和KPD），并进行了各种实验，测量它们在简单高斯分布和模拟高能喷流数据集上的性能。我们发现，特别是FPD是对所有替代喷流分布最敏感的度量标准。",
