    "abstract": "We explore training deep neural network models in conjunction with physics simulations via partial differential equations (PDEs), using the simulated degrees of freedom as latent space for a neural network. In contrast to previous work, this paper treats the degrees of freedom of the simulated space purely as tools to be used by the neural network. We demonstrate this concept for learning reduced representations, as it is extremely challenging to faithfully preserve correct solutions over long time-spans with traditional reduced representations, particularly for solutions with large amounts of small scale features. This work focuses on the use of such physical, reduced latent space for the restoration of fine simulations, by training models that can modify the content of the reduced physical states as much as needed to best satisfy the learning objective. This autonomy allows the neural networks to discover alternate dynamics that significantly improve the performance in the given task",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过偏微分方程（PDEs）的物理模拟与训练深度神经网络模型相结合，探索了使用模拟自由度作为神经网络的潜空间。与先前的工作不同，本文将模拟空间的自由度纯粹视为神经网络要使用的工具。我们展示了这个概念用于学习降维表示的能力，因为使用传统的降维表示在长时间跨度上忠实地保留正确解决方案是非常具有挑战性的，特别是对于具有大量小尺度特征的解决方案。本文着重于使用这种物理降维潜空间来恢复精细模拟，通过训练模型，使其能够根据学习目标尽可能多地修改降维的物理状态的内容。这种自主性允许神经网络发现改进给定任务性能的替代动态。",
