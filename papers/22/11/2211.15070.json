    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种高效的在线核Cumulative Sum (CUSUM)方法，用于变点检测，利用核统计量集合中的最大值来考虑未知的变点位置。相比于现有方法，如Scan-B统计量，即对应于非参数Shewhart图过程的方法，我们的方法对于小变化具有更高的敏感性。我们提供了两个关键性能指标的准确分析近似值：平均运行长度（ARL）和预期检测延迟（EDD），这使我们能够建立一个与ARL对数同阶的最优窗口长度，以确保相对于具有无限内存的理论模型能够保持最小功率损失。这类似于参数变点检测文献中的窗口限制广义似然比（GLR）过程的经典结果。此外，我们引入了一种递归计算程序，用于检测统计量，以确保计算和内存复杂度恒定。",
