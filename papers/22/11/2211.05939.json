    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了pyRDDLGym，一个用于从RDDL声明性描述自动生成OpenAI Gym环境的Python框架。RDDL中的变量的离散时间步进演化由条件概率函数描述，这与Gym步骤方案自然契合。此外，由于RDDL是一个抽象描述，将环境进行修改和扩展以支持多个实体和不同配置变得简单而不是繁琐的过程。我们希望pyRDDLGym能够由于RDDL的独特表达能力，成为强化学习社区中一股新的力量，从而实现易于快速开发基准，通过提供对RDDL描述中的模型的明确访问，pyRDDLGym还可以促进利用模型知识进行交互性学习的混合方法研究。我们介绍了pyRDDLGym的设计和内置示例，以及融入RDDL语言的附加内容。",
