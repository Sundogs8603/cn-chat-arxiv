    "abstract": "Modern portfolio theory has provided for decades the main framework for optimizing portfolios. Because of its sensitivity to small changes in input parameters, especially expected returns, the mean-variance framework proposed by Markowitz (1952) has however been challenged by new construction methods that are purely based on risk. Among risk-based methods, the most popular ones are Minimum Variance, Maximum Diversification, and Risk Budgeting (especially Equal Risk Contribution) portfolios. Despite some drawbacks, Risk Budgeting is particularly attracting because of its versatility: based on Euler's homogeneous function theorem, it can indeed be used with a wide range of risk measures. This paper presents mathematical results regarding the existence and the uniqueness of Risk Budgeting portfolios for a very wide spectrum of risk measures and shows that, for many of them, computing the weights of Risk Budgeting portfolios only requires a standard stochastic algorithm.",

    "translated_abstract": "现代投资组合理论长期以来一直是优化组合的主要框架。然而，由于对输入参数的微小变化（尤其是预期收益率）非常敏感，马尔科维茨（Markowitz）于1952年提出的均值方差框架受到了新的构建方法的挑战，这些方法纯粹基于风险。在风险主导的方法中，最流行的是最小方差、最大多样化和风险预算（特别是等风险贡献）投资组合。尽管存在一些缺点，但风险预算因其多样性而特别吸引人：基于欧拉齐次函数定理，它确实可以与各种风险度量一起使用。本文介绍了涵盖广泛风险度量范围的风险预算投资组合的存在性和唯一性的数学结果，并证明，在许多情况下，计算风险预算投资组合的权重仅需要标准随机算法即可实现。",
