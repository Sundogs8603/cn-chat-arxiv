    "translated_abstract": "抑郁症是全球严重的公共健康问题，然而，公共卫生系统在病例检测和诊断方面的能力有限。在这方面，广泛使用社交媒体为我们提供了获取大规模公共信息的途径。计算方法可以通过利用这些用户生成的社交媒体内容作为快速筛查的支持工具。本文介绍了一种有效的语义流程，基于用户在社交媒体上的文字，研究个体的抑郁症严重程度。我们选择测试用户的句子，对应于抑郁症状和严重程度水平的代表性训练句子的索引，产生语义排名。然后，我们使用这些结果中的句子作为预测用户症状严重程度的证据。为此，我们探索了不同的聚合方法来回答四个贝克抑郁自评量表(BDI)选项中的每个症状。我们在基于Reddit的两个基准上评估了我们的方法，达到了30％。",
