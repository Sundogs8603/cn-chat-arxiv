    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个高效的两阶段算法，用于解决高斯数据库之间的相关性检测和部分对齐回复问题。我们为假设检验问题建立了上下限，并证明了提出的检测器在某些特定参数选择下表现更好。在检测器被接受为相关性时，算法还会恢复给定数据库之间的部分对齐。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一个高效的算法，其中包括了两个阶段，分别解决了高斯数据库的相关性检测和部分对齐恢复问题；提出的检测器表现更佳，采用了一种新的图论技术来绑定相关性标准下的错误概率，并能恢复给定数据库的部分对齐。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes an efficient algorithm that includes two stages to solve the correlation detection and partial alignment recovery problem between Gaussian databases; the proposed detector performs better and uses a novel graph-theoretic technique to bound the error probability under the correlation model, and partial alignment recovery is achieved when the databases are accepted as correlated."
