FairMILE is a multi-level paradigm that can efficiently learn graph representations while enforcing fairness and preserving utility.

    "translated_abstract": "图表示学习模型在许多实际应用中展示了强大的能力。然而，先前的研究表明，这些模型可能会学习到偏见的表示，导致歧视性的结果。已经提出了一些方法来减轻图表示中的偏见。然而，大多数现有方法在训练和微调时需要异常的时间和计算资源。针对这个问题，我们研究了有效的公平图表示学习问题，并提出了一种新的框架FairMILE。FairMILE是一个多层范式，可以在保持公平性和保持实用性的同时有效地学习图表示。它可以与任何无监督嵌入方法配合使用，并且可以适应各种公平性约束。在不同的下游任务上进行了大量实验，结果显示FairMILE在运行时间方面明显优于现有方法，同时在公平性和效果之间实现了更优的平衡。",
