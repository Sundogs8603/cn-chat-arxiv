    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一个具有挑战性的决策任务，我们称之为多模态时间数据的主动获取（A2MT）。在许多实际场景中，输入特征在测试时不容易获得，必须以较大代价获取。通过A2MT，我们的目标是学习代理程序，使其能够主动选择要获取的输入模态，权衡获取成本与预测性能。A2MT扩展了之前的任务，称为主动特征获取，以便进行关于高维输入的时间决策。我们提出了一种基于Perceiver IO架构的方法来实现A2MT。我们的代理程序能够解决一个需要实际相关的跨模态推理技能的新颖合成情景。在两个大规模的真实数据集Kinetics-700和AudioSet上，我们的代理程序成功地学习了成本反应式的获取行为。然而，消融实验表明它们无法学习到自适应的获取策略，突显了该任务的困难性。",
