    "abstract": "We present a new convolution layer for deep learning architectures which we call QuadConv -- an approximation to continuous convolution via quadrature. Our operator is developed explicitly for use on non-uniform, mesh-based data, and accomplishes this by learning a continuous kernel that can be sampled at arbitrary locations. Moreover, the construction of our operator admits an efficient implementation which we detail and construct. As an experimental validation of our operator, we consider the task of compressing partial differential equation (PDE) simulation data from fixed meshes. We show that QuadConv can match the performance of standard discrete convolutions on uniform grid data by comparing a QuadConv autoencoder (QCAE) to a standard convolutional autoencoder (CAE). Further, we show that the QCAE can maintain this accuracy even on non-uniform data. In both cases, QuadConv also outperforms alternative unstructured convolution methods such as graph convolution.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的用于深度学习架构的卷积层，我们将其称为QuadConv——通过定积分对连续卷积进行近似。我们的操作符专门针对非均匀的基于网格的数据进行开发，通过学习一个可以在任意位置进行采样的连续核来实现这一点。此外，我们的操作符的构建还允许高效的实现，我们在文中详细介绍并构造了此实现。作为对我们的操作符的实验验证，我们考虑了从固定网格中压缩偏微分方程（PDE）模拟数据的任务。通过将QuadConv自动编码器（QCAE）与标准卷积自动编码器（CAE）进行比较，我们证明QuadConv能够与标准离散卷积在均匀网格数据上的性能相匹配。此外，我们还展示了QCAE即使在非均匀数据上也能够保持这种准确性。在两种情况下，QuadConv还优于图卷积等其他非结构化卷积方法。",
