    "abstract": "In recent years, Dialogue-style Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT4 have demonstrated immense potential in constructing open-domain dialogue agents. However, aligning these agents with specific characters or individuals remains a considerable challenge due to the complexities of character representation and the lack of comprehensive annotations. In this paper, we introduce the Harry Potter Dialogue (HPD) dataset, designed to advance the study of dialogue agents and character alignment. The dataset encompasses all dialogue sessions (in both English and Chinese) from the Harry Potter series and is annotated with vital background information, including dialogue scenes, speakers, character relationships, and attributes. These extensive annotations may empower LLMs to unlock character-driven dialogue capabilities. Furthermore, it can serve as a universal benchmark for evaluating how well can a LLM aligning with a specific character. We benchmark LLMs on HPD using both fine",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，像ChatGPT和GPT4这样的对话式大型语言模型展示了在构建开放领域对话代理方面的巨大潜力。然而，由于角色表现的复杂性和缺乏全面的注释，将这些代理与特定角色或个体对齐仍然是一个相当大的挑战。在本文中，我们介绍了哈利·波特对话（HPD）数据集，旨在推动对话代理和角色对齐的研究。该数据集涵盖了哈利·波特系列的所有对话场景（包括英文和中文），并注释了重要的背景信息，包括对话场景、说话者、角色关系和属性。这些详细的注释可能使大型语言模型能够实现基于角色的对话能力。此外，它还可以作为一个通用基准，评估一个大型语言模型与特定角色对齐的能力。我们在HPD上使用细致的评估指标来评估大型语言模型。",
