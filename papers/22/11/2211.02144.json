    "translated_abstract": "在同行评审系统中，评审人经常被要求评估提交稿件的各种特征，如技术质量或新颖性。给定每个预定义特征的评分，评审人必须提供一个整体的定量建议。可以假设每个评审人对特征集合到建议的映射都有自己的看法，并且不同的评审人心中有着不同的映射。这引入了一个称为比例偏差的任选性因素。本文讨论了一个由Noothigattu、Shah和Procaccia引入的框架，并且该框架在AAAI2022会议的组织者中应用。Noothigattu、Shah和Procaccia提出通过最小化特定损失函数来聚合评审人的映射，并研究了这种方法的社会选择理论中的公理性质。我们对他们的工作中使用的结果和假设进行了挑战，并报告了一些负面结果。",
