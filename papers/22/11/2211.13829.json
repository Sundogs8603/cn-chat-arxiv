    "translated_abstract": "非线性模型预测控制（MPC）是一种灵活且越来越受欢迎的框架，用于合成能够满足状态和控制输入约束的反馈控制策略。在该框架中，每个时间步骤都会解决一个优化问题，该问题受到由非线性动态模型表征的一组动态约束的限制。尽管具有通用性，但非线性MPC的性能通常取决于动态模型的准确性。在这项工作中，我们利用深度学习工具，即基于知识的神经常微分方程（KNODE）和深度集成，提高模型的预测准确性。具体而言，我们学习一个KNODE模型的集合，称为KNODE集合，以获得真实系统动态的准确预测。然后将这个学习的模型整合到一个新的学习增强型非线性MPC框架中。我们提供了足够的条件，保证了闭环系统的渐进稳定性。",
