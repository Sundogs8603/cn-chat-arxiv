    "abstract": "Image inpainting is the process of regenerating lost parts of the image. Supervised algorithm-based methods have shown excellent results but have two significant drawbacks. They do not perform well when tested with unseen data. They fail to capture the global context of the image, resulting in a visually unappealing result. We propose a novel self-supervised learning framework for image-inpainting: Weighted Self-Supervised Learning (WSSL) to tackle these problems. We designed WSSL to learn features from multiple weighted pretext tasks. These features are then utilized for the downstream task, image-inpainting. To improve the performance of our framework and produce more visually appealing images, we also present a novel loss function for image inpainting. The loss function takes advantage of both reconstruction loss and perceptual loss functions to regenerate the image. Our experimentation shows WSSL outperforms previous methods, and our loss function helps produce better results.",

    "translated_abstract": "图像修复是重新生成图像丢失部分的过程。基于监督算法的方法表现出色，但存在两个重要的缺点。它们在使用未见数据进行测试时表现不佳。它们无法捕捉到图像的全局上下文，导致结果视觉上不吸引人。我们提出了一种新颖的自监督学习框架用于图像修复：加权自监督学习（WSSL），以解决这些问题。我们设计了WSSL来从多个加权的先验任务中学习特征。然后利用这些特征进行下游任务，即图像修复。为了改善我们的框架的性能并产生更具视觉吸引力的图像，我们还提出了一种新颖的图像修复损失函数。该损失函数利用重建损失和感知损失函数来重新生成图像。我们的实验证明，WSSL优于先前的方法，并且我们的损失函数有助于产生更好的结果。",
