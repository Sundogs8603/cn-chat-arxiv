    "abstract": "We study the continuous-time portfolio selection under monotone mean-variance (MMV) preferences in a jump-diffusion model and give an explicit solution different from that under classical mean-variance (MV) preferences for the first time. We prove that ambiguity measures of MMV can be restricted on non-negative Dol\\'eans-Dade exponentials. We find that MMV can fix the non-monotonicity of MV when the jump size of the financial market can be larger than the inverse of the market price of risk. Such result is completely comparable to the earliest result of Dybvig and Ingersoll. Further, we verify the validity of two-fund separation and establish the monotone capital asset pricing model (monotone CAPM) for MMV investors. We also study MMV in a constrained trading model and provide three specific numerical examples to show MMV's efficiency. Our finding can be an important theoretical basis for future empirical tests of MMV and monotone CAPM's effectiveness.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在跳跃扩散模型下的连续时间单调均值方差(MMV)偏好的组合选择，并给出了与传统均值方差(MV)偏好不同的明确解决方案。我们证明了MMV的模糊度测度可以限制在非负的Dol\\'eans-Dade指数上。我们发现当金融市场的跳跃大小可以大于风险市场价格的倒数时，MMV可以修复MV的非单调性。这个结果与Dybvig和Ingersoll的最早结果完全可比。此外，我们验证了两个基金的隔离有效性，并建立了MMV投资者的单调资本资产定价模型（单调CAPM）。我们还研究了在限制交易模型中的MMV，并提供了三个具体的数值示例来展示MMV的效率。我们的发现可以成为未来对MMV和单调CAPM有效性进行实证测试的重要理论依据。",
