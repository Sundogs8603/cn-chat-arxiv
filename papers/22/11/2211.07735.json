    "translated_abstract": "现实问题需要同时对离散和连续随机变量进行混合信念的推理，但在规划的背景下，这种情况几乎没有被研究。此外，现有的在线部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）求解器不直接支持混合信念。作为本项工作的一部分，我们提出了一种新的算法，混合置信度蒙特卡罗规划（HB-MCP），该算法利用蒙特卡罗树搜索（MCTS）算法来解决POMDP，并保持混合置信度。我们演示了如何利用上置信度（UCB）探索奖励来指导假设树和信念树的增长。然后，在未解决数据关联导致多模态信念假设的高度模糊的模拟环境中评估了我们的方法。我们的结果显示，HB-MCP优于不支持混合信念的最先进的在线求解器。此外，我们证明了我们的算法可扩展到更大的计划范围，并且对不同的初始置信度配置具有鲁棒性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes the HB-MCP algorithm, which utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search to solve POMDP problems while maintaining hybrid beliefs. The algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art online solvers that do not support hybrid beliefs and is scalable and robust to different initial belief configurations."
