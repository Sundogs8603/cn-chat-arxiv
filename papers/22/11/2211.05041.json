    "abstract": "Controllable summarization allows users to generate customized summaries with specified attributes. However, due to the lack of designated annotations of controlled summaries, existing works have to craft pseudo datasets by adapting generic summarization benchmarks. Furthermore, most research focuses on controlling single attributes individually (e.g., a short summary or a highly abstractive summary) rather than controlling a mix of attributes together (e.g., a short and highly abstractive summary). In this paper, we propose MACSum, the first human-annotated summarization dataset for controlling mixed attributes. It contains source texts from two domains, news articles and dialogues, with human-annotated summaries controlled by five designed attributes (Length, Extractiveness, Specificity, Topic, and Speaker). We propose two simple and effective parameter-efficient approaches for the new task of mixed controllable summarization based on hard prompt tuning and soft prefix tuning. Result",

    "translated_abstract": "可控制的摘要生成可以让用户生成带有指定属性的自定义摘要。但是，由于缺乏受控摘要的指定注释，现有工作不得不通过适应通用摘要基准来创建伪数据集。此外，大多数研究专注于单个属性的控制（例如，短摘要或高度抽象的摘要），而不是控制混合属性一起（例如，短且高度抽象的摘要）。在本文中，我们提出MACSum，用于控制混合属性的第一个人工注释摘要数据集。 它包含来自两个域（新闻文章和对话）的源文本，由五个设计属性（长度、提取、特定性、主题和说话人）控制的人工注释摘要。我们提出了两种简单而有效的参数高效方法，用于新的混合可控制摘要任务，基于硬提示微调和软前缀微调。",
