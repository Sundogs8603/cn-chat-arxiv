    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest for mixed-categorical meta-models based on Gaussian process (GP) surrogates. In this setting, several existing approaches use different strategies either by using continuous kernels (e.g., continuous relaxation and Gower distance based GP) or by using a direct estimation of the correlation matrix. In this paper, we present a kernel-based approach that extends continuous exponential kernels to handle mixed-categorical variables. The proposed kernel leads to a new GP surrogate that generalizes both the continuous relaxation and the Gower distance based GP models. We demonstrate, on both analytical and engineering problems, that our proposed GP model gives a higher likelihood and a smaller residual error than the other kernel-based state-of-the-art models. Our method is available in the open-source software SMT.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于高斯过程代理的混合类别元模型引起了越来越多的关注。在这种情况下，一些现有的方法使用不同的策略，通过使用连续核（例如，连续松弛和Gower距离基于高斯过程）或通过直接估计相关矩阵。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于核的方法，将连续指数核扩展为处理混合类别变量。所提出的核引导到了一个新的高斯代理，它概括了连续松弛和Gower距离基于高斯过程模型。我们在分析和工程问题上证明了，我们的提出的高斯过程模型比其他基于核的现有模型具有更高的可能性和更小的残差误差。我们的方法可使用开源软件SMT。",
