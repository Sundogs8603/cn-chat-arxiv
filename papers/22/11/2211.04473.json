    "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for blind room impulse response (RIR) estimation systems in the context of a downstream application scenario, far-field automatic speech recognition (ASR). We first draw the connection between improved RIR estimation and improved ASR performance, as a means of evaluating neural RIR estimators. We then propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based architecture that encodes RIR features from reverberant speech and constructs an RIR from the encoded features, and uses a novel energy decay relief loss to optimize for capturing energy-based properties of the input reverberant speech. We show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on acoustic benchmarks (by 17\\% on the energy decay relief and 22\\% on an early-reflection energy metric), as well as in an ASR evaluation task (by 6.9\\% in word error rate).",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种针对下游应用情境（远场自动语音识别）中盲目估计室内声学环境下声道冲激响应的新方法。我们描述了改善声道冲激响应估计和提高语音识别性能之间的联系，以评估神经声道冲激响应估计器。我们提出了一种基于生成对抗网络（GAN）的架构，该架构从残响语音中编码RIR特征并构建RIR，并使用新的能量衰减缓解损失来优化捕获输入残响语音的能量相关特征。我们展示了我们的模型在声学基准测试上优于现有最先进基线模型（能量衰减缓解指标上提高了17％，早期反射能量性能指标上提高了22％），并且在语音识别评估任务中有6.9％的词误率降低。",
