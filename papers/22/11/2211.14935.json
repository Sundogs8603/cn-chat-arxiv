    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统在数字世界中影响着我们的许多交互，影响着我们购物、浏览YouTube或TikTok时所看到的内容，以及在使用酒店平台时展示给我们的餐馆和酒店。现代推荐系统是基于专有和开源数据集训练的庞大且不透明的模型。自然而然地，在开发者和用户方面引发了信任问题：系统是否正常工作，为什么用户收到（或未收到）特定的推荐？在推荐旁边提供解释可以减轻一些这些关注。目前辅助推荐系统反馈的现状要么是用户特定的解释（例如，“购买商品B的用户也购买了商品A”），要么是物品特定的解释（例如，“我们推荐商品A是因为您观看/购买了商品B”）。然而，用户将个性化的背景信息带入他们的搜索体验中，将一个物品的价值视为该物品的函数.",
