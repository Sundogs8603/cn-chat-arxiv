    "translated_abstract": "基于多次运行数值天气预报模型的集合天气预报通常会显示系统误差，并需要进行后处理才能获得可靠的预报。在许多实际应用中准确建模多变量依赖关系至关重要，因此提出了各种多变量后处理方法，其中集合预测首先在每个边际上分别进行后处理，然后通过copulas恢复多变量依赖关系。这些两步方法存在共同的主要局限性，特别是在建模依赖关系时难以包含附加的预测变量。我们提出了一种基于生成式机器学习的创新多变量后处理方法来解决这些挑战。在这种新的非参数化数据驱动分布回归模型中，多变量预测分布的样本直接作为生成神经网络的输出得到。通过优化适当的目标函数训练生成模型。",
