We use a PCA variational auto-encoder model to perfectly represent these descriptors into a latent space of three dimensions. Our new encoding brings significant benefits for synthetic surface generation, in that (i) scenario generation is more interpretable; (ii) volatility extrapolation achieve better accuracy; and, (iii) we propose a solution to infer implied volatility surfaces of a stock from an index to which it belongs directly by modelling their relationship on the latent space of the encoding.

    "translated_abstract": "在金融术语中，隐含波动率曲面可以通过其期限结构、偏度和总体波动率水平来描述。我们使用PCA变分自编码器模型将这些描述符完美地表示为三维潜空间。我们的新编码对于合成曲面生成带来了显着的益处，其中（i）情境生成更易解释；（ii）波动率外推实现更高精度；（iii）我们提出了一种解决方案，通过对编码的潜在空间建模来直接从指数向属于该指数的股票推断出其隐含波动率曲面。所有这些应用程序，特别是后者，具有在数据稀缺时改善金融衍生品风险管理的潜力。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种新编码方式，可以更好地生成隐含波动率曲面，提高了情境生成的解释性和波动率外推的精度，并且可以根据编码的潜在空间直接推断出指数中属于该指数的股票的隐含波动率曲面，从而改善金融衍生品风险管理的效果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new encoding method that can better generate implied volatility surfaces, improves the interpretability of scenario generation, increases the accuracy of volatility extrapolation, and enables the inference of implied volatility surfaces of stocks belonging to an index directly from the index's latent space, which has the potential to improve risk management of financial derivatives in data-scarce situations."
