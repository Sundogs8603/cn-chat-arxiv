    "translated_abstract": "自然语言生成(NLG)的最大挑战之一是正确处理命名实体。命名实体经常是语法错误的源头，如错误的介词、错误的冠词处理或错误的实体屈折。如果不考虑语言表示，当在一小组任意选择的参数值上进行评估，或将数据集从语言上较简单的语言(如英语)翻译到语言上较复杂的语言(如俄语)时，这些错误的重要性常常被低估。然而，对于某些应用来说，精确的语法正确性至关重要——母语使用者可能会觉得与实体相关的语法错误是愚蠢的、不和谐的甚至令人不快的。为了能够创建更具语言多样性的NLG数据集，我们发布了一个由语言学专家注释的\"具有语言学意义的实体语料库（CLSE）\"。该语料库包括34种语言，涵盖了74种不同的语义类型，以支持航空公司时间表等各种应用。",
