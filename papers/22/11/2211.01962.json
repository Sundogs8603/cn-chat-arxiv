    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在交互式决策的普遍框架下的样本高效强化学习（RL），该框架包括马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）、部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）和预测状态表示（PSR）作为特殊情况。为了找到赋予样本高效学习的最小假设，我们提出了一种新的复杂度度量，广义eluder系数（GEC），它表征了在线交互式决策中探索和开发之间的基本权衡。具体而言，GEC通过比较预测更新策略性能的误差与基于历史数据评估的样本内训练误差，来衡量探索的难度。我们展示了低GEC的RL问题形成了一个非常丰富的类别，其中包括低Bellman eluder维度问题、双线性类、低证人秩问题、PO-双线性类和广义正则PSR等。",

It captures the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, and divides RL problems into two classes: low GEC and high GEC, showcasing the richness of the low GEC class."
