    "translated_abstract": "由于超球的容量随半径的指数增长，超几何空间能够将具有层次结构的数据集嵌入其中而不失真。然而，这种指数增长的性质常常导致数值不稳定性，使得训练超几何学习模型有时会导致灾难性的NaN问题和浮点算术中遇到无法表示的值。在本文中，我们对两种广泛使用的超几何模型——Poincar\\'e球和Lorentz模型的局限性进行了仔细的分析。我们首先展示了，在64位算术系统下，Poincar\\'e球相对于Lorentz模型具有更大的能力来正确表示点。然后，我们从优化的角度理论上验证了Lorentz模型优于Poincar\\'e球的优越性。鉴于两种模型的数值限制，我们确定一种欧几里得优化方案，在Poincar\\'e球和Lorentz模型之外为超几何学习提供了一种新的方案。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the numerical instability issue in hyperbolic representation learning, compares two popular hyperbolic models (Poincar\\'e ball and Lorentz model), and identifies the Lorentz model with better numerical stability and optimization performance. A new Euclidean optimization approach is also proposed as an alternative choice for hyperbolic learning."
