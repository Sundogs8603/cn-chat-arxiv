    "translated_abstract": "在近年来，分布式机器学习受到了极大关注。然而，隐私保护仍然是这一领域尚未解决的问题。多密钥同态加密（MKTFHE）是解决这一问题的有希望的候选方案之一。然而，在MKTFHE的解密过程中可能存在安全风险。此外，据我们所知，关于MKTFHE的最新工作仅支持布尔运算和线性运算，无法直接计算Sigmoid等非线性函数。因此，仍然很难在高性能下执行逻辑回归和神经网络等常见机器学习任务。本文首先发现了针对现有MKTFHE分布式解密协议的可能攻击，随后引入了秘密分享以提出更安全的解密协议。接下来，我们通过\\emph{同态化器}和\\emph{比较四重子}设计了一个新的MKTFHE友好的激活函数。",
