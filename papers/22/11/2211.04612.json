    "translated_abstract": "本文开发了一种一致性推断方法，可以基于具有较小内存占用的草图，构建一个查询对象在大规模离散数据集中频率的置信区间。这种方法不需要对数据分布有任何了解，并且可以与任何草图算法结合使用，包括但不限于著名的count-min草图、count-sketch以及它们的变体。在解释如何实现可交换随机查询的边际覆盖后，我们将我们的解决方案扩展到提供更强的推断，可以考虑数据的离散性和异质查询频率，还增加了对可能的分布转换的鲁棒性。这些结果得益于一种新颖的一致性校准技术，可以保证大部分不同的随机查询具有有效的覆盖率。最后，我们通过模拟实验证明了我们的方法相比于现有的频率派和贝叶斯派替代方法具有更好的经验性能。",
