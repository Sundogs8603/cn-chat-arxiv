We integrate PIGINet within a TAMP planner that generates a diverse set of high-level task plans, sorts them by their predicted likelihood of feasibility, and refines them in that order.

Our experiments show that PIGINet substantially improves planning efficiency, cutting down runtime by 80% on problems with small state",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种学习可用的任务和动作规划（TAMP）算法，用于在存在多个关节和可移动障碍物的环境中解决移动操作问题。我们的思路是通过学习的计划可行性预测器对传统TAMP规划器的搜索过程进行偏置。算法的核心是PIGINet，这是一种新颖的基于Transformer的学习方法，它接收任务计划、目标和初始状态，并预测与任务计划相关联的运动轨迹的概率。我们将PIGINet集成到一个TAMP规划器中，该规划器生成一组多样化的高层任务计划，按照预测的可行性排序，并依次进行细化。我们对七种厨房重排问题的TAMP算法运行时间进行评估，将其性能与非学习基准进行比较。实验结果表明，PIGINet显着提高了规划效率，在状态较小的问题上缩短了运行时间80%。",
