    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的端到端神经架构，用于解决空间拼图和房间布局任务。所提出的系统\"PuzzleFusion\"针对后者任务，将一组房间布局视为俯视图中的多边形曲线，并通过估计它们的二维平移和旋转来对齐房间布局块，类似于解决空间拼图的过程。本文令人惊讶的发现是，扩散模型的简单使用有效地将这些具有挑战性的空间拼图任务解决为条件生成过程。为了实现端到端神经系统的学习，本文引入了新的数据集，其中包含有地面实况安排的数据集：1）2D Voronoi 拼图数据集，这是一种通过 2D 点集的 Voronoi 图生成拼图块的合成数据集；以及2）MagicPlan 数据集，这是一种从 MagicPlan 生产线提供的真实数据集，其中拼图块是由增强现实应用程序构建的房间布局。",
