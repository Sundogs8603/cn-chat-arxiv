    "translated_abstract": "法律判决预测是一种基于法律规则根据事实描述预测判决的法律辅助工具，旨在缓解有限法律从业人员的巨大工作负担。目前，大多数现有方法都采用各种大规模预训练语言模型（PLMs）在LJP任务中进行微调，从而实现了一致的改进。然而，我们发现现有的最先进模型根据无关（或非因果）信息进行判决预测。违反法律规则不仅削弱了模型的鲁棒性和普适性，还会导致严重的社会问题，如歧视。本文使用因果结构模型（SCMs）理论地分析了LJP模型如何学习做出决策以及为什么它们可以在不学习因果关系的情况下成功通过传统的测试范式。根据我们的分析，我们提供两种分别基于数据和模型的因果干预解决方案。",
