    "translated_abstract": "最近的无监督多对象检测模型在性能方面取得了令人印象深刻的改进，这主要归因于新颖的架构偏见。不幸的是，它们可能为下游任务产生次优的物体编码。为了克服这一问题，我们提出利用物体运动和连续性，即物体不能突然出现和消失。这通过两个机制实现：（i）通过集成光流提供物体位置的先验知识，（ii）对连续图像帧之间的对比物体连续性损失进行建模。与开发显式深度架构不同，得到的运动和物体连续性（MOC）方案可以使用任何基线对象检测模型来实现。我们的结果表明，相对于玩Atari游戏而言，SOTA模型在物体发现、收敛速度和总体潜在物体表示方面都有很大的改进。总的来说，我们展示了整合运动和连续性的明显好处。",
