    "abstract": "Neural conditional language generation models achieve the state-of-the-art in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) but are highly dependent on the quality of parallel training dataset. When trained on low-quality datasets, these models are prone to various error types, including hallucinations, i.e. outputs that are fluent, but unrelated to the source sentences. These errors are particularly dangerous, because on the surface the translation can be perceived as a correct output, especially if the reader does not understand the source language. We present a case study focusing on model understanding and regularisation to reduce hallucinations in NMT. We first use feature attribution methods to study the behaviour of an NMT model that produces hallucinations. We then leverage these methods to propose a novel loss function that substantially helps reduce hallucinations and does not require retraining the model from scratch.",

    "translated_abstract": "神经条件语言生成模型在神经机器翻译领域取得了最先进的成果，但是高度依赖于平行训练数据集的质量。当训练数据集质量较低时，这些模型容易出现各种错误类型，包括幻觉，即流畅但与源语言句子无关的输出。这些错误尤其危险，因为在表面上，翻译可能被认为是正确的输出，特别是如果读者不理解源语言。本文提出了一项用于降低神经机器翻译中幻觉的模型理解和规范化的案例研究。我们首先使用特征归因方法研究产生幻觉的NMT模型的行为，然后利用这些方法提出了一种新的损失函数，大大帮助减少幻觉，并且不需要从头重新训练模型。",
