    "translated_abstract": "在数字经济时代中，加密资产变得越来越重要，XRP是市场上一个大市值的加密资产。本文提出了一种新颖的相关张量谱方法，用于研究动态的XRP网络，该方法可以提供XRP价格的早期指示。通过聚合一周内所有交易而构建权重定向的交易网络，为每个节点获取一个向量，从一系列节点向量的快照中构造相关张量。相关张量的双奇异值分解可以得出奇异值，最大奇异值表现出与XRP/USD价格的显著负相关。通过比较其随机版本，表明奇异值的意义。",

The method constructs a weighted directed transaction network and obtains a vector for each node, followed by double singular value decomposition to obtain the significance of singular values, among which the largest one shows significant negative correlation with XRP/USD price."
