    "abstract": "The Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm has shown considerable success in solving complex combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). ALNS selects various heuristics adaptively during the search process, leveraging their strengths to find good solutions for optimization problems. However, the effectiveness of ALNS depends on the proper configuration of its selection and acceptance parameters. To address this limitation, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach that selects heuristics, adjusts parameters, and controls the acceptance criteria during the search process. The proposed method aims to learn, based on the state of the search, how to configure the next iteration of the ALNS to obtain good solutions to the underlying optimization problem. We evaluate the proposed method on a time-dependent orienteering problem with stochastic weights and time windows, used in an IJCAI competition. The results show that our approach outperforms vanilla ALNS and ALNS",

    "translated_abstract": "自适应大邻域搜索（ALNS）算法在解决复杂的组合优化问题（COPs）方面取得了相当的成功。ALNS在搜索过程中自适应地选择各种启发式策略，利用它们的优势来找到优化问题的良好解。然而，ALNS的有效性取决于其选择和接受参数的正确配置。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的方法，在搜索过程中选择启发式、调整参数和控制接受标准。所提出的方法旨在基于搜索的状态学习如何配置下一次ALNS迭代以获得好的优化问题解。我们在一个时间依赖的含有随机权重和时间窗口的导航问题上评估了所提出的方法，该问题用于IJCAI竞赛。结果表明，我们的方法优于普通的ALNS和具有默认参数设置的ALNS，展示了DRL方法在在线控制ALNS方面的有效性。",
