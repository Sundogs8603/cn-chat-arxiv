    "translated_abstract": "当变量数量庞大时，从观测数据中学习因果结构是一个基本但高度复杂的问题。本文从线性结构方程模型(SEMs)出发，研究了从逆协方差矩阵中学习因果结构的方法。所提出的方法称为$\\mathcal{O}$-ICID(来自Oracle 逆协方差矩阵的独立保持分解)，基于一种矩阵分解的连续优化，该分解保留了逆协方差矩阵的非零模式。我们证明了在噪声方差已知的情况下，$\\mathcal{O}$-ICID为识别真实有向无环图(DAG)提供了一种高效的方式。在较弱的先验信息下，所提出的方法可以给出有用的定向图解，用于进行更精细的因果发现。当真实DAG具有有限的节点度数时，所提出的方法具有低复杂度，在实验中表现出良好的时间效率。",

It can identify the true DAG when noise variances are known and give directed graph solutions when weaker prior information is available, suitable for large scale variables."
