    "translated_abstract": "Goldwasser等人（2021）最近提出了PAC验证的设置，其中使用交互式证明来验证假设（机器学习模型），该模型声称满足无知PAC学习目标。本文在多个方面进一步发展了这个概念。首先，我们证明了对于VC维度为$d$的假设类，PAC验证需要$\\Omega\\left(\\sqrt{d}/\\varepsilon^2\\right)$个i.i.d.样本的下界。其次，我们提出了一个用于PAC验证实数区间的并集的协议，该协议改进了他们提出的协议，并与我们的下界对$d$的依赖相匹配。第三，我们将他们的定义自然推广到了对一般统计算法的验证，这适用于更广泛的领域，超出了无知PAC学习的范畴。通过展示我们提出的定义，我们的最终结果是一种验证具有组合约束的统计查询算法的协议。",
