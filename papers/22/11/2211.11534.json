    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统在节点注入攻击下的鲁棒性备受关注。最近，提出了基于GNN的推荐系统GraphRfi，它有效减轻了注入的虚假用户的影响。但是，我们展示了GraphRfi仍然容易受到攻击，因为其欺诈者检测组件的监督性质，在实践中很难获得干净的标签。我们提出了一个强大的MetaC恶意攻击，针对GNN-based和MF-based推荐系统。根据我们从易受攻击性分析中得到的见解，我们设计了一种自适应欺诈者检测模块，明确考虑了标签不确定性。该模块可以作为不同推荐系统的插件，形成一个稳健的框架（PDR）。全面的实验表明，我们的防御方法在攻击下优于其他基准方法。总体而言，我们的工作强调了在构建欺诈者检测模块时考虑标签不确定性的重要性，并提供了改善推荐系统对节点注入攻击鲁棒性的实用解决方案。",
