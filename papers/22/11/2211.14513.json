    "translated_abstract": "非监督图像语义分割(UISS)旨在将低层视觉特征与语义级别的表示匹配，而无需外部监管。本文从特征对齐和特征均匀性的角度探究了UISS模型的关键性质，并将UISS与整幅图像的表示学习进行了比较。基于分析，我们认为UISS中现有的基于互信息的方法存在表示崩溃的问题。因此，我们提出了一种稳健的网络模型——Semantic Attention Network(SAN)，其中提出了一种新模块Semantic Attention(SEAT)，以动态生成逐像素和语义特征。在多个语义分割基准测试中的实验结果表明，我们的非监督分割框架专注于捕捉语义表示，表现优异，超过了所有未预训练的模型，甚至超过了一些预训练模型。",
