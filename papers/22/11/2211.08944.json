    "translated_abstract": "随机恢复算法允许探索与退化输入对应的解空间。本文揭示了随机方法相对于确定性方法的额外基本优势，并进一步激发了它们的使用动机。首先，我们证明了任何能达到完美感知质量且其输出与输入一致的恢复算法必须是一个后验采样器，因此必须是随机的。其次，我们说明了确定性恢复算法可能达到较高的感知质量，但只能通过使用极其敏感的映射填充所有可能的源图像空间来实现，这使它们非常容易受到对抗性攻击的影响。实际上，我们表明，要求确定性模型对这些攻击具有鲁棒性会严重阻碍其感知质量，而使随机模型具有鲁棒性几乎不会影响其感知质量，并改善其输出的可变性。这个发现将进一步支持随机估计器的使用。",
