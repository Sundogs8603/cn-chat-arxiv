    "abstract": "We introduce a novel model called GAMMT (Generative Ambiguity Models using Multiple Transformers) for sequential data that is based on sets of probabilities. Unlike conventional models, our approach acknowledges that the data generation process of a sequence is not deterministic, but rather ambiguous and influenced by a set of probabilities. To capture this ambiguity, GAMMT employs multiple parallel transformers that are linked by a selection mechanism, allowing for the approximation of ambiguous probabilities. The generative nature of our approach also enables multiple representations of input tokens and sequences. While our models have not yet undergone experimental validation, we believe that our model has great potential to achieve high quality and diversity in modeling sequences with uncertain data generation processes.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的模型，称为GAMMT（使用多个Transformer的生成不确定性模型），用于基于概率集合的序列数据。与传统模型不同，我们的方法认为序列的数据生成过程不是确定性的，而是模糊的，并受到一组概率的影响。为了捕捉这种不确定性，GAMMT采用了多个并行的Transformer，通过选择机制相互关联，允许近似处理模糊不确定的概率。我们的方法的生成特性还使得输入符号和序列可以有多个表征形式。虽然我们的模型尚未经过实验验证，但我们相信我们的模型在建模具有不确定的数据生成过程的序列的高质量和多样性方面具有巨大潜力。",
