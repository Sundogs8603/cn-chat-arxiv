    "translated_abstract": "在金融和医疗保健等各个领域中，确定时间序列中的变点变得至关重要，有利于指导更好的决策，并及时应对潜在的风险或机会。现有的变点检测方法在追踪多维特征的联合分布中的变化方面具有局限性。此外，它们不能有效地在同一时间序列中进行概括，因为不同类型的变点可能需要不同的检测方法。随着多维时间序列的数量不断增长，捕获各种复杂变点的类型已经成为必不可少的。为了克服现有方法的局限性，我们提出了TiVaCPD，一种方法，它使用时间变化图形套索（TVGL）来识别多维特征之间的相关模式随时间的变化，并将其与聚合核最大均值差异（MMD）测试相结合，以识别潜在变点。",
