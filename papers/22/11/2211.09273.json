    "translated_abstract": "情感监视是一个新兴领域，涉及到广泛的隐私问题。这些问题在普遍存在的物联网设备和多传感器的支持下，变得更加严重，而这些设备可以支持这些监视用例。本文考虑了一个这样的应用案例：使用与智能音箱相连的语音情感识别（SER）分类器。本文展示了如何在不影响智能音箱的效用的情况下，逃避与智能音箱相连的黑盒SER分类器。通过对机器学习的对抗逃避的视角来考虑这个隐私问题。我们的解决方案名为“通过遗传规划击败声学情感识别的DARE-GP”，它使用遗传规划生成非侵入性的添加音频扰动（AAPs）。通过约束这些AAP的进化，可以保护转录准确性，同时降低SER分类器的性能。这些AAP的加性特性，以及为特定目标生成这些AAPs的方法，使DARE-GP成为一个有效的隐私保护方法。",
