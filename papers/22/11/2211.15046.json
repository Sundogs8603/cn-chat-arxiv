    "translated_abstract": "降水预测方法已经在过去几个世纪里得到了很好的发展，因为雨水对人类生活有着至关重要的影响。现有的降水预测模型包括定量降水预测 (QPF) 模型、卷积长短期记忆 (ConvLSTM) 模型以及最新的 MetNet-2 等多种复杂的方法。本文提出了基于配对互补时间循环一致对抗网络 (PCT-CycleGAN) 的雷达降水预测方法，受对抗生成网络 (CycleGAN) 强大的图像转换性能启发。PCT-CycleGAN 使用两个具有向前和向后时间动态的生成器网络生成时序性，每个生成器网络学习一个庞大的一对一映射，以逼近表示每个方向上的时间动态的映射函数。为了创建配对互补循环之间的强健时间因果关系，我们应用了循环一致性损失和对抗性损失。广泛的实验证明，PCT-CycleGAN 在准确性和推广能力方面优于现有的技术方法。",
