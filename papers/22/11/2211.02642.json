    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a personalized seizure detection and classification framework that quickly adapts to a specific patient from limited seizure samples. We achieve this by combining two novel paradigms that have recently seen much success in a wide variety of real-world applications: graph neural networks (GNN), and meta-learning. We train a Meta-GNN based classifier that learns a global model from a set of training patients such that this global model can eventually be adapted to a new unseen patient using very limited samples. We apply our approach on the TUSZ-dataset, one of the largest and publicly available benchmark datasets for epilepsy. We show that our method outperforms the baselines by reaching 82.7% on accuracy and 82.08% on F1 score after only 20 iterations on new unseen patients.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种个性化癫痫检测和分类框架，从有限的癫痫样本中快速适应于特定患者。我们通过将两种新兴的范例——图神经网络和元学习相结合，实现了这一目标。我们训练了一种基于元图神经网络的分类器，该分类器从一组训练患者中学习了一个全局模型，以便最终可以使用非常有限的样本对新的未见过的患者进行调整。我们在 TUSZ 数据集上应用了我们的方法，这是公开可用的癫痫基准数据集之一。我们证明了我们的方法在仅进行了 20 次迭代后，即可在新的未见过的患者上达到 82.7% 的准确率和 82.08% 的 F1 分数，优于基线。",
