    "abstract": "Multiple instance learning exhibits a powerful approach for whole slide image-based diagnosis in the absence of pixel- or patch-level annotations. In spite of the huge size of hole slide images, the number of individual slides is often rather small, leading to a small number of labeled samples. To improve training, we propose and investigate different data augmentation strategies for multiple instance learning based on the idea of linear interpolations of feature vectors (known as MixUp). Based on state-of-the-art multiple instance learning architectures and two thyroid cancer data sets, an exhaustive study is conducted considering a range of common data augmentation strategies. Whereas a strategy based on to the original MixUp approach showed decreases in accuracy, the use of a novel intra-slide interpolation method led to consistent increases in accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "在像素或补丁级别注释缺失的情况下，多示例学习展示了一种基于整张切片图像的诊断的强大方法。尽管整张切片图像的大小很大，但个别切片的数量往往相对较小，导致标记样本数量少。为了提高训练效果，我们提出并研究了基于特征向量的线性插值（即MixUp）思想的不同数据增强策略。基于最先进的多示例学习架构和两个甲状腺癌数据集，进行了一项详尽的研究，考虑了多种常见的数据增强策略。尽管基于原始MixUp方法的策略表现出准确度降低，但使用一种新颖的切片内插值方法却实现了一致的准确度提高。",
