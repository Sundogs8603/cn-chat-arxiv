    "abstract": "Action advising is a knowledge transfer technique for reinforcement learning based on the teacher-student paradigm. An expert teacher provides advice to a student during training in order to improve the student's sample efficiency and policy performance. Such advice is commonly given in the form of state-action pairs. However, it makes it difficult for the student to reason with and apply to novel states. We introduce Explainable Action Advising, in which the teacher provides action advice as well as associated explanations indicating why the action was chosen. This allows the student to self-reflect on what it has learned, enabling advice generalization and leading to improved sample efficiency and learning performance - even in environments where the teacher is sub-optimal. We empirically show that our framework is effective in both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, yielding improved policy returns and convergence rates when compared to state-of-the-art methods",

    "translated_abstract": "行为建议是一种基于师生范式的强化学习知识转移技术。专家老师在训练期间提供建议，以提高学生的样本效率和策略表现。这种建议通常以状态-动作对的形式给出。然而，这使得学生难以推理和应用于新颖状态。我们引入了可解释的行为建议，其中老师提供行为建议和相关的解释，说明为什么选取该行为.这允许学生自我反思所学的内容，实现建议的泛化，并导致学习效率的提高——即使在老师不理想的情况下，也可以有效地应用于单智能体和多智能体场景中。我们通过实验证明，与最先进的方法相比，我们的框架可以产生更好的策略回报和收敛速率。",
