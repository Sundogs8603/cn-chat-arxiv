    "translated_abstract": "由于学习排序方法（LTR）主要是为了提高排序质量，它们的输出分数设计上并不是经过尺度校准的。这从根本上限制了LTR在对分数敏感的应用中的使用。虽然一个简单的多目标方法可以有效地组合回归和排序目标来学习经过尺度校准的分数，但我们认为这两个目标不一定兼容，这使得它们之间的权衡对于任一个都不是理想的。本文提出了一种实用的回归兼容排序（RCR）方法，实现了更好的权衡，其中证明了两个排序组件和回归组件是相互一致的。尽管相同的思路适用于具有二进制和分级相关性的排序，但在本文中我们主要关注二进制标签。我们在几个公共LTR基准上评估了所提出的方法，并展示了它在回归和排序度量方面 consistently achieves either best or competitive result, and significantl的结果，以及在回归和排序度量方面 consistently achieves either best or competitive result方面达到了最好或有竞争力的结果, and significantly improved the state-of-the-art性的改进。",

In LTR benchmark tests with binary labels, this method consistently achieves either best or competitive result in terms of both regression and ranking metrics, with significant improvement over existing methods."
