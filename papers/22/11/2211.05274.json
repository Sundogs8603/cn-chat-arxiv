    "translated_abstract": "假设我们给定一个由$r$个随机秩-1项组成的$n$维三阶对称张量$T \\in (\\mathbb{R}^n)^{\\otimes 3}$，则当$r \\lesssim n^2$时，可以在原则上恢复秩-1分量，但是仅在$r \\ll n^{3/2}$的情况下才知道存在多项式时间算法。许多高维推断任务中存在类似的“统计计算差距”，近年来，研究人员通过针对统计查询（SQ），平方和（SoS）和低次多项式（LDP）等受限（但强大）的计算模型证明下限，以解释这些问题的计算难度。然而，在张量分解中不存在类似“植入对空”的测试问题来解释其难度，这也是目前不存在任何此类工作的原因之一。我们考虑了一个随机三阶张量分解模型，其中一个分量的范数略大于其余分量（以破坏对称性）。",
