    "abstract": "A monopoly platform sells either a risky product (with unknown utility) or a safe product (with known utility) to agents who sequentially arrive and learn the utility of the risky product by the reporting of previous agents. It is costly for agents to report utility; hence the platform has to design both the prices and the reporting bonus to motivate the agents to explore and generate new information. We characterize the optimal bonus and pricing schemes offered by the profit-maximizing platform. It turns out that the optimal scheme falls into one of four types: Full Coverage, Partial Coverage, Immediate Revelation, and Non-Bonus. In a model of exponential bandit, we find that there is a dynamical switch of the types along the learning trajectory. Although learning stops efficiently, information is revealed too slowly compared with the planner's optimal solution.",

    "translated_abstract": "一个垄断平台向顺序到达并通过先前代理的报告学习垄断平台销售风险产品(未知效用)或安全产品(已知效用)的代理商。对于代理商来说，报告效用是昂贵的；因此，平台必须设计价格和奖励机制来激励代理商探索并生成新信息。我们特征化了利润最大化平台提供的最优奖励和定价方案。结果显示，最优方案分为四类：全覆盖、部分覆盖、即时揭示和非奖励。在指数赌博模型中，我们发现在学习过程中存在类型的动态转换。尽管学习效率高，但信息的揭示速度与规划者的最优解太慢。",
