In this paper, we introduce our plug-and-play retrieval method with error-robust information for Chinese Spelling Check (RERIC), which can be directly applied to existing CSC models. The datastore for retrieval is built completely based on the training data, with elaborate designs according to the characteristics of CSC.

    "translated_abstract": "中文拼写检查（CSC）旨在检测和纠正中文语境中的错误标记，具有广泛的应用。然而，它面临着标注数据不足和以前的方法可能实际上并未充分利用现有数据集的挑战。在本文中，我们引入了一种面向中文拼写检查的错误鲁棒信息的即插即用检索方法（RERIC），可直接应用于现有的CSC模型。检索的数据存储完全基于训练数据构建，并根据CSC的特性进行精心设计。具体来说，我们在检索过程中在查询和关键字的计算中使用融合音系、形态和上下文信息的多模态表示，以增强对潜在错误的鲁棒性。此外，为了更好地判断检索到的候选项，会考虑要检查的标记周围的n-gram。",
