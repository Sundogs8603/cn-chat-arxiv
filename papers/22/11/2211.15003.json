    "translated_abstract": "近年来，Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction（ASTE）已成为情感分析研究中的新兴任务，旨在从给定的句子中提取方面术语、相应的意见术语和相应的情感极性三元组。然而，目前提出的大多数基于神经网络的模型都有其局限性：过于依赖于1）假设每个单词仅与单个角色（例如，方面术语或意见术语等）相关联和2）词级交互并将每个意见/方面视为一组独立的单词。因此，在复杂的ASTE任务中效果不佳，例如一个单词与多个角色相关联或者一个方面/意见术语由多个单词组成。因此，我们提出了一种新方法，Span标记和贪心推理（STAGE），以在跨度级别上提取情感三元组，其中每个跨度可能由多个单词组成，并同时扮演不同的角色。为此，本文提出了一种名为STAGE的新方法来处理ASTE任务，它比以前的模型更准确地识别了给定句子中方面术语、相应的意见术语和相关的情感极性。",
