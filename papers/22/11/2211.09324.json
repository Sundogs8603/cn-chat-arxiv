    "translated_abstract": "协同过滤是推荐系统中最基本的主题之一。从矩阵分解到图卷积方法，已经提出了各种各样的协同过滤方法。在图过滤方法和基于分数的生成模型（SGM）的最近成功启发下，我们提出了一种新的模糊-锐化过程模型（BSPM）的概念。SGM和BSPM共享相同的处理哲学，即在将原始信息首先扰乱然后恢复到原始形式的过程中可以发现新信息（例如，在SGM的情况下生成新图像）。然而，SGM和我们的BSPM处理不同类型的信息，并且它们的最优扰动和恢复过程存在根本上的差异。因此，我们的BSPM与SGM具有不同的形式。此外，我们的概念不仅理论上包括了许多现有的协同过滤模型，而且在显式和隐式反馈的情况下，在召回率和NDCG方面也优于它们。具体而言，我们提出了一组具有不同模糊和锐化滤波器设置的BSPM，并推导了期望最大化（EM）算法以学习模型参数。四个基准数据集的实验结果证明了我们的模型相对于现有技术方法的有效性。",
