    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了因果推断中的模型选择问题，特别是针对二元治疗条件下条件平均处理效应（CATE）估计的情况。与机器学习中的模型选择不同，由于我们无法观察到任何数据点的反事实潜在结果，因此没有完美的交叉验证模型。为此，文献中提出了各种代理度量方法，这些方法取决于从观察到的数据中估计的辅助干扰模型（倾向性得分模型、结果回归模型）。然而，这些度量方法的有效性仅在我们可以访问反事实数据的合成数据集上进行了研究。我们进行了广泛的实证分析，以评估文献中介绍的这些度量方法以及本研究中介绍的新方法的性能，在实现多个逼真数据集的最新生成建模进展基础上进行。我们的分析表明了新的模型选择策略的出现。",
