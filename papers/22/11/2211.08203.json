    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，静态词嵌入可以编码词频信息。然而，对于这一现象及其对下游任务的影响，研究相对较少。在本研究中，我们系统地研究了几种静态词嵌入中频率和语义相似性的关联。我们发现，Skip-gram、GloVe和FastText嵌入往往在高频词之间产生较高的语义相似性，而在其他频率组合之间产生较低的语义相似性。我们还表明，即使在词袋中对词进行了随机重新排列，频率和相似性之间的关联仍然存在。这证明了所发现的模式并非由于文本中存在真实的语义关联，而是词嵌入产生的人为产物。最后，我们提供了一个示例，说明词频如何对基于嵌入的偏见度量产生强烈影响。特别地，我们进行了一项对照实验，显示偏见甚至可以改变符号或反转其方向。",
