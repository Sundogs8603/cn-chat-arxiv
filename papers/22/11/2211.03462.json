    "translated_abstract": "混合表格-文本问答要求从异构信息进行推理，推理类型主要分为数值推理和跨度提取。当前的数值推理方法通过自回归解码程序序列，每个解码步骤生成运算符或操作数。然而，逐步解码存在暴露偏差，并且由于错误传播，程序生成的准确性随着解码步骤的展开而急剧下降。本文提出了一种非自回归程序生成框架，可以独立生成包含运算符和操作数的完整程序元组，可以解决错误传播问题，并显著提高程序生成的速度。在ConvFinQA和MultiHiertt数据集上的实验表明，我们的非自回归程序生成方法可以比强大的FinQANet方法带来实质性的改进（+5.06 Exe Acc点和+4.80 Prog Acc点）。",
