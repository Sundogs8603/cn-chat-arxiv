    "translated_abstract": "开放关系抽取(OpenRE)旨在发现开放领域的新关系。以前的OpenRE方法主要存在两个问题：(1)无法充分区分已知关系和新关系。当将常规测试设置扩展到更通用的设置时，其中测试数据可能也来自已知类别，现有方法的性能显著下降。(2)在实际应用之前必须进行二次标注。现有方法无法为新关系标记人类可读和有意义的类型，这是下游任务迫切需要的。为解决这些问题，我们提出了活跃关系发现(ARD)框架，它利用关系异常值检测来区分已知和新关系，并涉及主动学习用于标记新关系。对三个真实数据集的大量实验证明，ARD在常规和我们提出的更通用的设置上都显著优于以前的最先进方法。",
