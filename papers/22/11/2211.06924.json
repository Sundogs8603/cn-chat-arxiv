    "translated_abstract": "利用多模态特征（例如图像和文本描述）的多模态推荐系统通常比仅基于用户-物品交互的一般推荐模型具有更好的推荐准确性。然而，先前的研究通常将多模态特征融合到物品ID嵌入中，以丰富物品表示，因此无法捕捉潜在的语义物品-物品结构。在这种情况下，LATTICE提出了显式学习物品之间的潜在结构，并在多模态推荐方面取得了最先进的性能。然而，我们认为LATTICE的潜在图结构学习既低效又不必要。实验证明，在训练之前冻结其物品-物品结构也可以实现竞争性的性能。基于这一发现，我们提出了一个简单而有效的模型，名为FREEDOM，它同时冻结物品-物品图并去噪用户-物品交互图以进行多模态推荐。",
