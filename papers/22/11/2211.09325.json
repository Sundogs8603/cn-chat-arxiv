    "translated_abstract": "我们如何赋予机器人有效地操作未知物体的能力，并基于示范转移相关技能？端到端学习方法通常无法泛化到新的物体或未见过的配置。相反，我们关注交互对象相关部分的任务特定姿势关系。我们推测这种关系是一种可以转移到同一类别新物体的操作任务的可泛化概念；例如，平底锅相对于烤箱的姿势关系或者杯子相对于杯架的姿势关系。我们称这种任务特定姿势关系为“跨姿势”，并提供了该概念的数学定义。我们提出了一个基于视觉的系统，使用学习的对象间对应关系来学习估计给定操作任务的两个对象之间的跨姿势。然后，估计的跨姿势用于引导下游的运动规划器将对象操纵到所需的姿势。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种名为TAX-Pose的系统，在机器人操作中实现了任务特定跨姿势的估计。通过学习对象之间的对应关系，这种系统能够在给定操作任务的情况下准确估计两个对象之间的跨姿势，并利用估计结果指导下游的运动规划。"
