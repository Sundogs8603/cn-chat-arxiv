Most sequential recommenders however lack a higher-level understanding of user intents, which often drive user behaviors online. Intent modeling is thus critical for understanding users and optimizing long-term user experience. We propose a probabilistic modeling approach and formulate user intent as latent variables, which are inferred based on user behavior signals using variational autoencoders (VAE). The recommendation policy is then adjusted accordingly given the inferred user intent.

    "translated_abstract": "序列推荐模型是现代工业推荐系统的关键组成部分。这些模型通过学习用户在平台上的互动历史，预测用户可能会与哪些项目进行交互。然而，大多数序列推荐器缺乏对用户意图的高级理解，而用户意图通常驱动着在线用户行为。因此，意图建模对于理解用户并优化长期用户体验至关重要。我们提出了一种概率建模方法，将用户意图作为潜在变量，并使用变分自编码器（VAE）根据用户行为信号进行推断。然后，根据推断出的用户意图调整推荐策略。我们通过离线分析和大规模工业推荐平台上的实时实验证明了潜在用户意图建模的有效性。",
