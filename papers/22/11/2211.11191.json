    "translated_abstract": "先进的推荐系统通常涉及多个领域（如场景或类别）以满足用户各种需求。 多领域推荐（MDR）的目标是同时提高所有领域的推荐性能。传统的基于图神经网络的方法通常分别处理每个领域，或者训练一个共享模型来服务于所有领域。本文提出了一种基于层次化超图网络的相关偏好转移框架$\\mathsf{H^3Trans}$，将多领域用户-物品交互表示为一个统一的图来帮助偏好转移。$\\mathsf{H^3Trans}$包含两个基于超边的模块，分别是动态超图注意网络（DHAN）和跨领域偏好转移网络（CDPT），以捕捉用户和物品之间的领域内和跨域交互。此外，我们提出了一个层次化的架构来建模用户的多级特征偏好。在三个真实数据集上的实验结果表明，$\\mathsf{H^3Trans}$优于现有方法。",
