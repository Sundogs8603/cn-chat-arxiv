In this paper, we show that up to 70% of adversarial examples generated by adversarial attacks should be discarded because they do not preserve semantics. We address this core weakness and propose a new, fully supervised sentence embedding technique called Semantics-Preserving-Encoder (SPE). Our method outperforms existing sentence encoders used in adversarial attacks by achieving 1.2x - 5.1x better real attack success rate.
