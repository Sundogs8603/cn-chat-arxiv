    "translated_abstract": "反事实推理是人类思维中广泛存在的一种推理方式——设想一些假设场景或可能存在的情况，这些情况与实际情况不同。传统上，反事实情景被视为局部违反自然规律的“小奇迹”，但它们具有相同的初始条件。而在Pearl的结构因果模型(SCM)框架中，这通过修改因果定律的干预而使得外生变量的值共享得到了数学上的严格化。但近年来，哲学家和心理学家对这种单纯的干预主义反事实观点提出了越来越多的质疑。相反，他们提出了一种回溯式反事实观点，即在反事实世界中因果定律保持不变，将与实际情况的差异“回溯”到改变的初始条件(外生变量)。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于简单但灵活的图形模型的回溯式反事实推理的形式化方法。我们认为，在某些情况下，特别是在推理过去时，我们的模型提供了一种更自然、更直观的反事实推理方法。",
