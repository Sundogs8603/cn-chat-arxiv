    "abstract": "Algorithmic fairness plays an increasingly critical role in machine learning research. Several group fairness notions and algorithms have been proposed. However, the fairness guarantee of existing fair classification methods mainly depends on specific data distributional assumptions, often requiring large sample sizes, and fairness could be violated when there is a modest number of samples, which is often the case in practice. In this paper, we propose FaiREE, a fair classification algorithm that can satisfy group fairness constraints with finite-sample and distribution-free theoretical guarantees. FaiREE can be adapted to satisfy various group fairness notions (e.g., Equality of Opportunity, Equalized Odds, Demographic Parity, etc.) and achieve the optimal accuracy. These theoretical guarantees are further supported by experiments on both synthetic and real data. FaiREE is shown to have favorable performance over state-of-the-art algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "算法公平性在机器学习研究中发挥着越来越重要的作用。已经提出了几种群体公平性概念和算法。然而，现有公平分类方法的公平保证主要依赖于特定的数据分布假设，通常需要大样本量，并且在样本量较小的情况下可能会违反公平性，而这在实践中经常发生。本文提出了FaiREE算法，它是一种公平分类算法，可以在有限样本和无分布理论保证下满足群体公平性约束。FaiREE可以适应各种群体公平性概念（例如，机会平等，平衡几率，人口统计学平衡等）并实现最佳准确性。这些理论保证进一步得到了对合成和实际数据的实验支持。FaiREE表现出比最先进的算法更好的性能。",
