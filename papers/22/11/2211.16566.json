    "translated_abstract": "现有的统计方法可以估计一个策略，或者一个从协变量到决策的映射，然后指导决策者（例如，基于协变量血压和心率是否应该进行低血压治疗）。在医疗保健中使用这些数据驱动的策略具有极大的兴趣。然而，通常重要的是向医疗保健提供者和患者解释如何从当前的标准护理转变为新的护理政策。为此，我们从信任域策略优化（TRPO）中借鉴了想法。然而，在我们的工作中，与TRPO不同的是，在将标准治疗转变为新的建议治疗时，需要强制将策略的方面（即血压和心率的参数）固定在相对较少的位置上，以帮助可解释性。这产生了“相对稀疏”，作为一个调整参数$\\lambda$的函数，我们可以确定政策差异的位置和大小。",
