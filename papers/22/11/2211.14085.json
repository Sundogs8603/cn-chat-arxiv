    "abstract": "Positive unlabeled learning is a binary classification problem with positive and unlabeled data. It is common in domains where negative labels are costly or impossible to obtain, e.g., medicine and personalized advertising. Most approaches to positive unlabeled learning apply to specific data types (e.g., images, categorical data) and can not generate new positive and negative samples. This work introduces a feature-space distance-based tensor network approach to the positive unlabeled learning problem. The presented method is not domain specific and significantly improves the state-of-the-art results on the MNIST image and 15 categorical/mixed datasets.

    "translated_abstract": "正无标记学习是一个包含正面和无标记数据的二元分类问题。它在负面标签昂贵或无法获取的领域（如医药和个性化广告）中很常见。大多数正无标记学习的方法应用于特定的数据类型（如图像，分类数据），不能生成新的正面和负面样本。本文提出了一种基于特征空间距离的张量网络方法来解决正无标记学习问题。所提出的方法不依赖领域，并在MNIST图像和15个分类/混合数据集上显著改进了最新的结果。训练的张量网络模型还是一个生成模型，可以生成新的正面和负面实例。",
