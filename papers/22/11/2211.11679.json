    "translated_abstract": "物体实例的分割是机器人需要掌握的关键感知技能之一，它有助于机器人抓取和操作未知物体。均值漂移聚类是一种广泛用于图像分割任务的方法。然而，传统的均值漂移聚类算法不可微分，使其难以集成到端到端的神经网络训练框架中。在本文中，我们提出了均值漂移掩模变换器（MSMFormer），这是一种新的变换器体系结构，模拟 von Mises-Fisher（vMF）均值漂移聚类算法，允许联合训练和推断特征提取器和聚类器。其核心组件是超球面注意力机制，可在超球面上更新物体查询。为了说明我们方法的有效性，我们将MSMFormer应用于未知物体实例分割。实验结果表明，MSMFormer在COCO数据集上与现有方法相比取得了竞争性的性能，并且在罕见和未知物体类别上具有显着优势。",
