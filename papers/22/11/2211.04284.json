    "translated_abstract": "随着物联网的广泛应用，大量的传感器信息正在实时采集。因此，从边缘设备传输数据的通讯成本不断增加。压缩感知（CS）是一种可用于边缘设备的数据压缩方法，并因其可节省通讯成本而备受关注。在压缩感知中，估计合适的压缩比是重要的。现有的利用强化学习（RL）自适应估计获得数据的压缩比的方法，其计算成本常常很高。本研究开发了一种针对边缘设备的高效RL方法，称为actor-critic在线连续极限学习机（AC-OSELM），并利用AC-OSELM开发了一种在边缘设备上通过估计适当的压缩比压缩数据的系统。通过使用实际传感器数据进行实验，评估了所提出方法在估计压缩比和重构压缩数据方面的性能。结果表明我们提出的方法在保持重构压缩数据的准确性的同时，提供了比强化学习和传统方法更高效的压缩比估计方法。",
