    "abstract": "Piano covers of pop music are enjoyed by many people. However, the task of automatically generating piano covers of pop music is still understudied. This is partly due to the lack of synchronized {Pop, Piano Cover} data pairs, which made it challenging to apply the latest data-intensive deep learning-based methods. To leverage the power of the data-driven approach, we make a large amount of paired and synchronized {Pop, Piano Cover} data using an automated pipeline. In this paper, we present Pop2Piano, a Transformer network that generates piano covers given waveforms of pop music. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model to generate a piano cover directly from pop audio without using melody and chord extraction modules. We show that Pop2Piano, trained with our dataset, is capable of producing plausible piano covers.",

    "translated_abstract": "流行音乐的钢琴翻奏深受很多人的喜爱。然而，自动生成流行音乐的钢琴翻奏的任务仍然缺乏研究。部分原因是缺少同步的{流行，钢琴翻奏}数据对，这使得应用最新的数据密集型深度学习方法变得具有挑战性。为了发挥数据驱动方法的威力，我们使用自动化流程生成了大量配对和同步的{流行，钢琴翻奏}数据。在本文中，我们提出了Pop2Piano，一个能够根据流行音乐的波形生成钢琴翻奏的Transformer网络。据我们所知，这是第一个直接从流行音频生成钢琴翻奏的模型，而无需使用旋律和和弦提取模块。我们展示了使用我们数据集训练的Pop2Piano能够产生合理的钢琴翻奏。",
