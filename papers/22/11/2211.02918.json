    "translated_abstract": "认知图是概率论证的认知方法的一种推广。Hunter提出了一个二次推广框架来从众包数据中学习认知约束。然而，学习到的认知约束只反映了用户从数据中的信念，而没有考虑到认知图中编码的合理性。与此同时，当前框架只能生成反映代理人信​​任程度而不是是否相信一个论点的认知约束。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个基于筛选的方法，使用多重推广步骤从数据集中生成一组与其认知图一致的合理规则。这种方法能够学习更广泛的合理规则，以反映认知图中的合理性考虑。实验结果表明，我们的方法在学习合理规则的精度和多样性方面优于现有方法。",

The approach is able to learn a wider variety of rational rules that reflect rationality considerations in epistemic graphs, and outperforms existing methods in terms of the precision and diversity of the learned rules."
