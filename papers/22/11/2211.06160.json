    "abstract": "Recent text-to-speech models have reached the level of generating natural speech similar to what humans say. But there still have limitations in terms of expressiveness. The existing emotional speech synthesis models have shown controllability using interpolated features with scaling parameters in emotional latent space. However, the emotional latent space generated from the existing models is difficult to control the continuous emotional intensity because of the entanglement of features like emotions, speakers, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel method to control the continuous intensity of emotions using semi-supervised learning. The model learns emotions of intermediate intensity using pseudo-labels generated from phoneme-level sequences of speech information. An embedding space built from the proposed model satisfies the uniform grid geometry with an emotional basis. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was superior in controllability and naturalness.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的文本到语音模型已经达到了生成类似于人类说话的自然语音的水平。但在表达能力方面还存在一些限制。现有的情感语音合成模型使用情感潜在空间中的缩放参数进行插值特征控制已经显示出了可控性。然而，由于包含情感、说话者等特征的融合，现有模型生成的情感潜在空间难以控制连续的情感强度。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的半监督学习方法，通过学习使用基于音素级语音信息的伪标签产生的中间强度的情感。从提出的模型中构建的嵌入空间满足带有情感基础的统一网格几何。实验结果表明，所提出的方法在可控性和自然度方面具有优越性。",
