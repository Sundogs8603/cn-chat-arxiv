    "translated_abstract": "压力测试，特别是反向压力测试，是风险管理实践中一个重要的练习。与（前向）压力测试相反，反向压力测试旨在寻找一个替代但合理的模型，以便在该替代模型下，特定的不利压力（即约束条件）得到满足。在这里，我们提出了一个针对动态模型的反向压力测试框架。具体而言，我们考虑了一个在有限时间范围内的复合泊松过程，以及在终止时间对该过程应用函数的期望值构成的压力。然后，我们将受压模型定义为一个概率度量，该概率度量使该过程满足约束条件，并且最小化与参考复合泊松模型的Kullback-Leibler散度。我们解决了这个优化问题，证明了受压概率度量的存在性和唯一性，并提供了从参考模型到受压模型的Radon-Nikodym导数的表征。",
