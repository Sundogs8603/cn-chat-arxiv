    "translated_abstract": "人体重定位的任务涉及生成一个站立在任意构想姿势下的真实人物图像。生成感知准确图像存在多个困难，现有方法在保留纹理、维持图案一致性、考虑服装边界、处理遮挡、调整皮肤生成等方面存在局限性。这些困难还因可能的人体姿势方向空间巨大且多变、服装物品的本质高度非刚性、身体形状的多样性大大不同于人口中的多样性而进一步恶化。为了缓解这些困难并合成感知准确的图像，我们提出了VGFlow。我们的模型使用可见性引导流模块将流分离为目标的可见和不可见部分，以实现同时纹理保留和风格操作。此外，为了解决不同的身体形状和避免网络伪影，我们还采用了一个多路径结构，包括全局结构路径和多个局部细节路径，可以在不同级别的细节上进行操作。实验结果显示了所提出方法在生成具有精细细节和准确纹理的逼真人体姿势方面的有效性。",
