    "abstract": "Convex PCA, which was introduced by Bigot et al., is a dimension reduction methodology for data with values in a convex subset of a Hilbert space. This setting arises naturally in many applications, including distributional data in the Wasserstein space of an interval, and ranked compositional data under the Aitchison geometry. Our contribution in this paper is threefold. First, we present several new theoretical results including consistency as well as continuity and differentiability of the objective function in the finite dimensional case. Second, we develop a numerical implementation of finite dimensional convex PCA when the convex set is polyhedral, and show that this provides a natural approximation of Wasserstein geodesic PCA.

    "translated_abstract": "凸型主成分分析(Convex PCA)是一种在希尔伯特空间的凸子集上进行数据降维的方法。这种设置在许多应用中都很自然地出现，包括区间Wasserstein空间中的分布数据以及Aitchison几何下的排序组成数据。本文的贡献有三个方面。首先，我们给出了几个新的理论结果，包括有限维情况下的一致性以及目标函数的连续性和可微性。其次，当凸集是多面体时，我们发展了一个数值实现的有限维凸型主成分分析方法，并且证明了这提供了Wasserstein测地线主成分分析的自然近似。第三，我们通过两个金融应用来说明我们的结果，即按大小排序的股票收益分布和资本分布曲线，这两个应用在随机投资组合理论中都具有独立的重要性。",
