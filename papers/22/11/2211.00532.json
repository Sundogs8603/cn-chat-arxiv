    "abstract": "We consider robust utility maximisation in continuous-time financial markets with proportional transaction costs under model uncertainty. For this, we work in the framework of Chau and R\\'asonyi (2019), where robustness is achieved by maximising the worst-case expected utility over a possibly uncountable class of models that are all given on the same underlying filtered probability space with incomplete filtration. In this setting, we give sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal trading strategy extending the result for utility functions on the positive half-line of Chau and R\\'asonyi (2019) from continuous to general strictly positive c\\`adl\\`ag price processes. This allows us to provide a positive answer to an open question pointed out in Chau and R\\'asonyi (2019), and shows that the embedding into a countable product space is not essential.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了连续时间的金融市场中，模型不确定性下，比例交易成本下的鲁棒效用最大化。我们在 Chau 和 R\\'asonyi（2019）的框架下工作，通过在可能不可数的模型类上最大化最坏期望效用来实现鲁棒性。在这个设置下，我们给出了存在最优交易策略的充要条件，将 Chau 和 R\\'asonyi（2019）关于正半轴效用函数的结果从连续到通用的正严格的 c\\`adl\\`ag 价格过程得到了扩展。这使我们能够正面回答 Chau 和 R\\'asonyi（2019）指出的一个开放性问题，同时也表明嵌入到可数乘积空间并不是必要的。",
