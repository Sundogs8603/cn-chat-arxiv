    "translated_abstract": "近期，DreamFusion展示了一个预训练的文本到图像扩散模型（text-to-image diffusion model）优化神经辐射场（Neural Radiance Fields，NeRF）的实用性，实现了惊人的文本到3D合成结果。然而该方法具有两个固有限制：（a）NeRF的优化速度极慢，（b）对NeRF的低分辨率图像空间监督，导致长时间处理的低质量3D模型。本文通过利用一个两步优化框架来解决这些限制。首先，我们使用低分辨率扩散先验获得一个粗糙模型，并加速通过使用稀疏的3D哈希网格结构。使用粗略表示作为初始化，我们采用高分辨率潜在扩散模型相互作用的高效可微渲染器进一步优化纹理3D网格模型。我们的方法名为Magic3D，可以在40分钟内创建高质量3D网格模型，这比DreamFusion（据报道平均需要1.5小时）快2倍。",
