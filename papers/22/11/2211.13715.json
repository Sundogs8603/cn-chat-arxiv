Observational data are often insufficient to identify a system's causal structure uniquely. While conducting interventions (i.e., experiments) can improve the identifiability, such samples are usually challenging and expensive to obtain. Hence, experimental design approaches for causal discovery aim to minimize the number of interventions by estimating the most informative intervention target. In this work, we propose a novel Gradient-based Intervention Targeting method, abbreviated GIT, that 'trusts' the gradient estimator of a gradient-based causal discovery framework to provide signals for the intervention acquisition function. We provide extensive experiments in simulated and real-world datasets and demonstrate that GIT performs on par with competitive baselines, surpassing them in the low-data regime.",

    "translated_abstract": "从数据中推断因果结构是科学中一项具有基础重要性的挑战性任务。观测数据通常不足以唯一确定系统的因果结构。虽然进行干预（即实验）可以改善可识别性，但这些样本通常难以获得且成本高昂。因此，因果发现的实验设计方法旨在通过估计最具信息性的干预目标来最小化干预次数。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于梯度的干预目标定位方法，简称为GIT，它‘相信’了基于梯度的因果发现框架的梯度估计器，以提供干预采集函数的信号。我们在模拟和真实世界数据集上进行了大量实验，并证明GIT在低数据量情况下表现与竞争基线相当，甚至在某些情况下超越它们。",
