    "translated_abstract": "从观测数据中进行治疗效果评估是因果推断中的一个核心问题。基于潜在结果框架的方法通过利用因果推断中的归纳偏置和启发式方法来解决这个问题。每种现有的技术都通过设计神经网络架构和正则化器来解决治疗效果评估的特定方面，例如控制倾向得分、强制随机化等。在本文中，我们提出了一种自适应方法，称为神经符号治疗效果估计器（NESTER），它是一种治疗效果评估的通用方法。NESTER将治疗效果估计的所有要求集成到一个框架中。为此，我们设计了一个基于文献中使用的归纳偏置的治疗效果估计的领域特定语言（DSL）。我们还在理论上研究了NESTER在治疗效果估计任务中的能力。我们全面的实证结果表明，与现有的最先进方法相比，NESTER在多个基准数据集上的效果更好。",
