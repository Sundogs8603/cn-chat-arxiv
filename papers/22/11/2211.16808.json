This problem shares its end goal with the task of patching neural nets where small changes in some of the network's weights need to be discovered so that upon applying these changes, the modified net produces the desirable output for a given set of inputs.

    "translated_abstract": "对抗性输入的生成已成为建立深度神经网络的鲁棒性和可信度的关键问题，尤其是当它们在自动驾驶车辆和精确医学等安全关键应用领域使用时。然而，这个问题面临多个实际挑战，包括由于网络规模大而导致的可扩展性问题，以及生成缺乏自然性和输出中立性等重要特征的对抗性输入。这个问题与修补神经网络的任务共享相同的最终目标，其中需要发现一些网络权重的微小变化，以便在应用这些变化后，修改后的网络对于给定的输入集产生理想的输出。我们通过提出从一个修补补丁中获取对抗性输入来利用这种联系，其中的观察是通过改变输入也可以实现改变权重的效果。因此，本文提出了一种新颖的方法来解决这个问题。",
