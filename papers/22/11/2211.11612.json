    "translated_abstract": "为对象检测标注数据集是一项昂贵且耗时的工作。为了最大限度地减少这一负担，采用主动学习（AL）技术来在限定的“标注预算”内选择信息量最大的样本进行标注。传统的AL策略通常依赖于模型的不确定性或样本的多样性进行查询抽样，而更先进的方法则专注于开发AL特定的对象检测器架构以提高性能。然而，这些专门化方法由于集成所需的大量工程工作，不容易适应不同的对象检测器。为了克服这一挑战，我们引入了即插即用主动学习（PPAL），这是一种简单而有效的对象检测AL策略。PPAL是一个包含基于不确定性和多样性抽样阶段的两阶段方法。在第一阶段，我们的难度校准不确定性抽样...",
