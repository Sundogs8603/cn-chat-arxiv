    "translated_abstract": "本文研究使用面板数据的决策制定问题，其中决策者得到了多个单位（或代理人）的有噪声、重复的测量结果。我们考虑了一个设置，其中存在一个干预前期，当决策者观察每个单位的结果后，会根据这些观察结果为每个单位分配一个处理。与传统的设置不同的是，我们允许生成面板数据的单位采取策略，即单位可能会修改其干预前的结果以获得更理想的干预。本文旨在设计一个无欺诈的干预策略，也就是一个能够对单位进行正确干预的策略，无论单位是否进行了策略。我们首先确定了一个必要且充分的条件来判断无欺诈的干预策略是否存在，并提供了一个具有简单闭合形式的无欺诈机制。在此过程中，我们证明了具有应用于劳动力市场信号的战略性多类分类设置的不可能性结果。",
