    "translated_abstract": "在微观等离子体物理问题中，动力学方法一般很准确，但对于大尺度或多尺度系统而言计算开销较大。等离子体物理学中长期存在的问题之一是如何将动力学物理学整合到流体模型中，通常通过复杂的解析闭合项实现。本研究成功构建了一个多矩便流体模型，其中神经网络包含隐式流体闭合项，采用机器学习的物理引导神经网络（PINN）和梯度增强的物理引导神经网络（gPINN）对少量稀疏采样的动力学仿真数据进行训练。使用PINN或gPINN构建的多矩便流体模型能够重现Landau阻尼的电场能量时变演化，包括其阻尼率，以及动力学仿真中的等离子体动力学。我们首次引入了一个新变量，即多矩便雷诺应力张量，该变量表征流体-细结构相互作用，是理解等离子体多尺度效应的关键。我们的方法提供了一种有效的数据驱动方法，将流体模型的有效性扩展到多尺度系统，为研究等离子体动力学提供了显著优势。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes a physics-informed neural network based data-driven method, which successfully constructs a multi-moment fluid model with an implicit fluid closure term, reproducing the kinetic features of Landau damping and introducing a new variable characterizing the fluid-fine structure interaction. This efficient approach extends the validity of fluid models to multiscale systems, offering a significant advantage for studying plasma dynamics."
