    "abstract": "Understanding users' intentions in e-commerce platforms requires commonsense knowledge. In this paper, we present FolkScope, an intention knowledge graph construction framework to reveal the structure of humans' minds about purchasing items. As commonsense knowledge is usually ineffable and not expressed explicitly, it is challenging to perform information extraction. Thus, we propose a new approach that leverages the generation power of large language models~(LLMs) and human-in-the-loop annotation to semi-automatically construct the knowledge graph. LLMs first generate intention assertions via e-commerce-specific prompts to explain shopping behaviors, where the intention can be an open reason or a predicate falling into one of 18 categories aligning with ConceptNet, e.g., IsA, MadeOf, UsedFor, etc. Then we annotate plausibility and typicality labels of sampled intentions as training data in order to populate human judgments to all automatic generations. Last, to structurize the assert",

    "translated_abstract": "理解电商平台用户的意图需要常识知识。本文介绍了FolkScope，一种意图知识图谱构建框架，用于揭示有关购买物品的人类思维结构。由于常识知识通常不易言传且未明确表达，因此执行信息提取具有挑战性。因此，我们提出了一种新方法，利用大型语言模型的生成能力和人机交互注释来半自动构建知识图谱。首先，LLM通过电商特定提示生成意图断言，以解释购物行为，其中意图可以是开放原因或落入与ConceptNet对齐的18个类别之一的谓词，例如：是，由...制成，用于...等。然后，我们对随机抽样的意图进行合理性和典型性标注，作为训练数据，以便将人类判断应用于所有自动生成的数据。最后，为了将断言结构化，我们使用一种无向图神经网络将意图关系映射到知识图谱中。",
