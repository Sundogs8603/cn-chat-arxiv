Unfortunately, these new methods often lack reliability and explainability, and there is a growing interest to address these shortcomings while retaining the boost in performance. In this work, we tackle this issue by revisiting regularizers that are the sum of convex-ridge functions. The gradient of such regularizers is parameterized by a neural network that has a single hidden layer with increasing and learnable activation functions. This neural network is trained within a few minutes as a multistep Gaussian denoiser. The numerical experiments for denoising, CT, and MRI reconstruction show improvements over methods that offer similar reliability guarantees.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习方法在解决图像重建问题上的出现，使得重建质量有了显著提高。然而，这些新方法往往缺乏可靠性和可解释性，因此人们越来越关注如何在保持性能提升的同时解决这些问题。本研究通过重新审视由凸脊函数组成的规则化器来解决这个问题。这些规则化器的梯度由一个具有单个隐藏层的神经网络参数化，其中包含逐渐增加和可学习的激活函数。该神经网络作为多步高斯去噪器在几分钟内进行训练。去噪、CT和MRI重建的数值实验显示，与提供类似可靠性保证的方法相比，本方法具有改进。",
