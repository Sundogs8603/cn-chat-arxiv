    "translated_abstract": "最近对综合感知和通信的兴趣导致了设计新的信号处理技术来从叠加的雷达通信信号中恢复信息。在这里，我们关注的是一个谱共存的情况，在这种情况下，雷达和通信系统的信道和发送信号对于普通接收器来说都是未知的。在这个双盲反卷积问题中，接收器接收一个多载波无线通信信号，该信号与从多个目标反射回来的雷达信号相叠加。通信和雷达信道分别由多个传输路径和目标所对应的连续值范围时间或延迟表示。之前的研究通过原子泛函最小化来解决这个不适定的双盲反卷积问题中未知信道和信号的恢复，但是需要雷达和通信信道的各自最小分离条件。在本文中，我们提供了一个最优的联合分离条件。",
