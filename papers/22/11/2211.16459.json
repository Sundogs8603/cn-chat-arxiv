    "translated_abstract": "基于比较的学习解决的问题是当我们只有形式为“目标A与B相比较比C更相似”这样的比较，而没有显式特征或成对相似度时的学习问题。最近，已经证明在层次聚类中，可以直接使用这样的比较实现单一和完全链接，同时已经提出了几种算法来模拟平均链接的行为。因此，使用仅比较找到层次结构（或树状图）是一个被充分理解的问题。然而，当没有基准事实或显式相似性时，评估它们的意义仍然是一个开放性的问题。在本文中，我们通过提出一个新的收益函数来弥补这一差距，该函数允许我们仅使用比较来衡量树状图的好坏。文章还表明，该函数与使用成对相似性的层次聚类的Dasgupta成本密切相关。在理论方面，我们使用拥有好的性质的收益函数来分析比较的相关性，并推导了一些高斯过程的相关结论。",
