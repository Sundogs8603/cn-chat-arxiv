    "translated_abstract": "大部分学习外语的人会遇到听不懂或者无法与母语为某一口音的人进行对话的难题。对于母语为某一口音的人来说，理解或者使用新的口音同样是一项困难的任务。一种能够改变说话者口音但保留说话者声音特征（如音色和音高）的口音转换系统具有广泛的应用潜力，例如交流、语言学习和娱乐。现有的口音转换模型往往同时改变说话者的身份和口音。在这里，我们使用对抗学习来解耦口音相关特征，同时保留其他声学特征。我们的工作与现有的口音转换模型不同之处在于，它可以将未知说话者的语音转换为多个口音，同时保留其原始声音特征。主观评估显示，我们的模型生成的音频更接近目标口音，且更像原始语音。",
