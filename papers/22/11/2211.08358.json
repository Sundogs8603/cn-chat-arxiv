To alleviate these issues, we make two contributions for more stable and effective few-shot learning: First, we propose novel ensembling methods and show that they substantially reduce run variability. Second, we introduce a new active learning (AL) criterion for data selection and present the first AL-based approach specifically tailored towards prompt-based learning.

    "translated_abstract": "通过启动和提示，基础模型已经成为高效的少样本学习器，在少样本分类方面取得了巨大进展。然而，这种方法在不同的少样本集合（数据选择）和不同的微调运行（运行变异性）之间具有高变化率，这不仅阻碍了不同方法之间的公平比较，而且使得少样本学习对许多实际应用过于不可靠。为了缓解这些问题，我们提出了两个贡献，用于更稳定和有效的少样本学习：首先，我们提出了新颖的集成方法，并展示了它们可以大幅减少运行变异性。其次，我们引入了一种新的主动学习（AL）准则用于数据选择，并呈现了第一个专门针对基于提示的学习的AL方法。在实验中，我们展示了我们的联合方法MEAL（多提示微调与预测集成与主动学习）可以稳定地在少量样本下进行分类。",
