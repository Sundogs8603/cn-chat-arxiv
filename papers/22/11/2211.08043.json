    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了从镜像下降到镜像-近端及其乐观变种的Bregman近端方法的最后迭代收敛速度，作为一种依赖于定义方法的近端映射所导致的局部几何的函数。为了通用性，我们关注约束的非单调变分不等式的局部解，并且我们证明了给定方法的收敛速度取决于其相关的Legendre指数，这个概念度量了接近解的Bregman函数（欧几里得、熵或其他函数）的增长速率。特别地，我们证明了边界解在具有零和非零Legendre指数的方法之间存在明显的分离情况：前者以线性速度收敛，而后者一般以次线性速度收敛。在线性约束问题中，当方法具有熵正则化时，这种二分法在尖锐方向上实现线性收敛速度，与传统收敛速度的差别更加突出。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper examines the convergence rate of Bregman proximal methods and finds that it is dependent on factors such as local geometry, regularity, and sharpness. Specifically, the authors discover a notable difference between methods with zero and non-zero Legendre exponents for boundary solutions, with the former converging linearly and the latter converging sublinearly. In the case of linearly constrained problems, methods with entropic regularization achieve linear convergence rate along sharp directions, distinguishing them from the traditional convergence rate."
