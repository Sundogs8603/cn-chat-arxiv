    "translated_abstract": "在互联的数字世界中，个人助手、自动语音识别器和对话理解系统变得越来越重要。航空交通管制通信就是其中一个明显的例子。空中交通管制旨在以安全和最优的方式指导飞行器和控制空域。这些基于语音的对话是通过超高频无线电频道在空中交通管制员（ATCO）和飞行员之间进行的。为了将这些新技术纳入ATC（低资源领域），需要大规模的注释数据集来开发数据驱动的AI系统，其中包括自动语音识别（ASR）和自然语言理解（NLU）。在本文中，我们介绍了ATCO2语料库，这是一个旨在促进ATC领域研究的数据集，由于缺乏注释的数据，该领域滞后很多。ATCO2语料库包括1）数据收集和预处理，2）语音数据的伪注释，和3）提取与空中交通管制相关的命名实体。",
