    "translated_abstract": "外移梯度方法由于其在可微分博弈中的稳健收敛性而受到青睐。与单目标优化不同，博弈动力学涉及到复杂的相互作用，这种相互作用通过博弈向量场的雅可比矩阵的特征值散布在复平面上。这种复杂性会导致简单的梯度方法发散，即使对于双线性博弈也是如此，而外移梯度方法却能实现收敛。在最近证明的基础上，即动量外移梯度方法在双线性博弈中实现加速收敛\\citep{azizian2020accelerating}，我们使用基于多项式的分析来确定该方法出现进一步加速收敛的三种不同情景。这些情景包括特征值存在于（正）实轴上、位于实轴上的共轭复数以及仅存在共轭复数的情况。此外，我们还推导出每个情景的超参数，以实现最快的收敛。",
