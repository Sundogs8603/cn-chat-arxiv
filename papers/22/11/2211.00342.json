    "translated_abstract": "自动化合成音声的最新评估方法是基于 MOS 预测神经模型，其中 MOSNet 和 LDNet 使用频谱特征作为输入，而 SSL-MOS 则依赖于预训练的自监督学习模型，直接使用语音信号作为输入。在现代高质量的神经 TTS 系统中，就发音内容而言，声调的适当性是决定性的因素。为此，我们建议在 MOS 预测系统中包括声调和语言特征作为额外的输入，并评估它们对预测结果的影响。我们考虑了音素级的 F0 和持续时间特征作为声调输入，以及 Tacotron 编码器输出、POS 标记和 BERT 嵌入作为更高级别的语言输入。所有 MOS 预测系统均在 SOMOS 上进行训练，该数据集仅有神经语音合成技术和众包自然度 MOS 评估数据。结果表明，所提出的额外特征能够有利于提高 MOS 预测结果，相对于仅使用频谱特征的基线 MOSNet，平均提高了12%。",
