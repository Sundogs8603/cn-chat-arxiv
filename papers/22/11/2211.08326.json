    "abstract": "Building accurate Deep Learning (DL) models for brain age prediction is a very relevant topic in neuroimaging, as it could help better understand neurodegenerative disorders and find new biomarkers. To estimate accurate and generalizable models, large datasets have been collected, which are often multi-site and multi-scanner. This large heterogeneity negatively affects the generalization performance of DL models since they are prone to overfit site-related noise. Recently, contrastive learning approaches have been shown to be more robust against noise in data or labels. For this reason, we propose a novel contrastive learning regression loss for robust brain age prediction using MRI scans. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenBHB challenge, yielding the best generalization capability and robustness to site-related noise.",

    "translated_abstract": "在神经影像学中，构建准确的深度学习模型用于脑龄预测是一个非常相关的主题，因为它可以帮助更好地理解神经退行性疾病并寻找新的生物标志物。为了估计准确且可泛化的模型，已经收集了大量的数据集，它们通常是多中心和多扫描器的。这种大规模异构性会对深度学习模型的泛化性能产生负面影响，因为它们容易过度拟合与特定场地相关的噪音。最近，对比学习方法表现出在数据或标签噪声方面更为稳健。因此，我们提出了一种新的对比学习回归损失，用于MRI扫描的脑龄预测。我们的方法在OpenBHB挑战赛上实现了最先进的性能，具有最佳的泛化能力和抗场地相关噪声的鲁棒性。",
