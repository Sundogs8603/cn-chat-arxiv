    "abstract": "Over the past few years, large knowledge bases have been constructed to store massive amounts of knowledge. However, these knowledge bases are highly incomplete. To solve this problem, we propose a web-based question answering system system with multimodal fusion of unstructured and structured information, to fill in missing information for knowledge bases. To utilize unstructured information from the Web for knowledge base completion, we design a web-based question answering system using multimodal features and question templates to extract missing facts, which can achieve good performance with very few questions. To help improve extraction quality, the question answering system employs structured information from knowledge bases, such as entity types and entity-to-entity relatedness.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，大型知识库已经建立来存储大量知识，然而这些知识库非常不完整。为了解决这个问题，我们提出一种使用基于网络问答和多模态融合的方法填补知识库中的缺失信息。为了利用网络上的非结构化信息完成知识库，我们设计了一个基于网络问答的系统，使用多模态特征和问题模板来提取缺失的事实，仅仅通过非常少的问题就可以达到良好的效果。同时，该问答系统还使用知识库中的结构化信息，比如实体类型和实体之间的关联性，以帮助提高抽取质量。",
