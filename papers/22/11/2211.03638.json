The method proposed in this article constitutes an extension of our previous work, where the problem of sampling from time-integrated stochastic bridges was addressed. The model relies on the Seven-League scheme, where artificial neural networks are employed to \"learn\" the distribution of the random variable of interest utilizing stochastic collocation points. The method results in a robust procedure for Monte Carlo pricing. Furthermore, semi-analytic formulae for option pricing are provided in a simplified, yet general, framework. The model guarantees high accuracy and a reduction of the computational time up to thousands of times compared to classical Monte Carlo pricing schemes.",
