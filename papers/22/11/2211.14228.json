    "translated_abstract": "为了训练儿童提问好奇心驱动的问题的能力，之前的研究探索了设计特定的练习，依靠提供语义和语言提示来帮助形成这样的问题。但尽管表现出了教学效率，但该方法仍然受限于手动生成提示，这可能是一个非常昂贵的过程。在这种情况下，我们提议利用自然语言处理领域（NLP）的先进技术，并调查使用大型语言模型（LLM）自动化好奇心问题提问（QA）培训的教育内容的有效性。我们研究使用“基于提示”的方法来生成教育内容，该方法包括使用自然文本向LLM解释任务。我们使用人类专家注释和手动生成内容进行评估。结果确实表明了这种内容的相关性和有用性。我们还在小学进行了现场研究（75个孩子）",
