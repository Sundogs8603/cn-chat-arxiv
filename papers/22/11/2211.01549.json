    "abstract": "As a privacy-preserving paradigm for training Machine Learning (ML) models, Federated Learning (FL) has received tremendous attention from both industry and academia. In a typical FL scenario, clients exhibit significant heterogeneity in terms of data distribution and hardware configurations. Thus, randomly sampling clients in each training round may not fully exploit the local updates from heterogeneous clients, resulting in lower model accuracy, slower convergence rate, degraded fairness, etc. To tackle the FL client heterogeneity problem, various client selection algorithms have been developed, showing promising performance improvement. In this paper, we systematically present recent advances in the emerging field of FL client selection and its challenges and research opportunities.

    "translated_abstract": "作为一种保护隐私的机器学习模型训练范式，联邦学习在工业界和学术界都受到了广泛关注。在典型的联邦学习场景中，客户端在数据分布和硬件配置方面显示出明显的异质性。因此，每一轮训练中随机选择客户端可能无法充分利用来自异构客户端的本地更新，导致模型准确性降低、收敛速度变慢、公平性下降等问题。为了解决联邦学习客户端异构性问题，已经开发了各种客户端选择算法，展示出了有希望的性能改进。在本文中，我们系统地介绍了近期在联邦学习客户端选择这一新兴领域的进展，以及其中的挑战和研究机会。我们希望能够帮助从业者选择最适合其应用的客户端选择机制，同时激发研究人员和新人对这一令人兴奋的研究领域有更好的理解。",
