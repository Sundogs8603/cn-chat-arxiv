    "abstract": "Automatic software generation based on some specification is known as program synthesis. Most existing approaches formulate program synthesis as a search problem with discrete parameters. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of program synthesis as a continuous optimization problem and use a state-of-the-art evolutionary approach, known as Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy to solve the problem. We then propose a mapping scheme to convert the continuous formulation into actual programs. We compare our system, called GENESYS, with several recent program synthesis techniques (in both discrete and continuous domains) and show that GENESYS synthesizes more programs within a fixed time budget than those existing schemes. For example, for programs of length 10, GENESYS synthesizes 28% more programs than those existing schemes within the same time budget.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于某些规范的自动软件生成被称为程序合成。大多数现有方法将程序合成制定为具有离散参数的搜索问题。本文提出了一个新的连续优化问题的程序合成公式，并使用最先进的进化方法之一，称为协方差矩阵自适应进化策略来解决问题。然后，我们提出一个映射方案来将连续公式转换为实际程序。我们将我们的系统 GENESYS 与几种最近的程序合成技术（在离散和连续域中）进行比较，并展示 GENESYS 在相同时间预算内合成的程序比那些现有的方案更多。例如，对于长度为 10 的程序，GENESYS 在相同的时间预算内合成的程序比现有方案多 28％。",
