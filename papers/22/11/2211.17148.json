    "abstract": "Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems function as digital assistants, guiding users through various tasks such as booking flights or finding restaurants. Existing toolkits for building TOD systems often fall short of in delivering comprehensive arrays of data, models, and experimental environments with a user-friendly experience. We introduce ConvLab-3: a multifaceted dialogue system toolkit crafted to bridge this gap. Our unified data format simplifies the integration of diverse datasets and models, significantly reducing complexity and cost for studying generalization and transfer. Enhanced with robust reinforcement learning (RL) tools, featuring a streamlined training process, in-depth evaluation tools, and a selection of user simulators, ConvLab-3 supports the rapid development and evaluation of robust dialogue policies. Through an extensive study, we demonstrate the efficacy of transfer learning and RL and showcase that ConvLab-3 is not only a powerful tool for seasoned researchers",

    "translated_abstract": "面向任务的对话系统（TOD）作为数字助手，可以引导用户完成诸如预订航班或寻找餐厅等各种任务。目前用于构建TOD系统的工具包通常在提供全面的数据、模型和实验环境方面存在不足，用户体验也不友好。我们介绍了ConvLab-3：一个多方面的对话系统工具包，旨在弥合这一差距。我们的统一数据格式简化了不同数据集和模型的集成，显著降低了研究广泛泛化和迁移的复杂性和成本。通过强化学习（RL）工具的增强，包括简化的训练过程、深入的评估工具以及多个用户模拟器的选择，ConvLab-3支持快速开发和评估鲁棒的对话策略。通过广泛的研究，我们证明了迁移学习和RL的有效性，并展示了ConvLab-3不仅是一款强大的工具供经验丰富的研究人员使用。",
