    "translated_abstract": "公共和商业组织广泛共享网络威胁情报(CTI)以防范现有和新兴的网络攻击。然而，传统的CTI主要集中在追踪已知的威胁指标（如IP地址和域名），可能在防御不断演变的攻击方面提供长期价值。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出使用更强大的威胁情报信号，称为攻击模式。LADDER是一个知识提取框架，可以从CTI报告中大规模提取基于文本的攻击模式。该框架通过捕捉Android和企业网络中攻击的各个阶段，并将其系统地映射到MITRE ATT\\&CK模式框架，来对攻击模式进行表征。LADDER可以被安全分析师用来确定与现有和新兴威胁相关的攻击向量的存在，使他们能够主动准备防御措施。我们还提供了几个使用案例来演示其应用。",
