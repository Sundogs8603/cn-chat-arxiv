    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了 uSplit，一种专门用于荧光显微镜图像中的训练图像分解的方法。我们发现，使用常规的深度结构体系结构在训练时使用大图像块会获得最佳结果，使内存消耗成为进一步提高性能的限制因素。因此，我们引入了横向上下文化（LC），一种内存高效的方法来训练强大的网络，并展示LC在处理任务时始终带来了显著的改进。我们将LC与U-Nets、分层自编码器和分层VAEs集成，为此我们制定了一种改进的ELBO loss。此外，LC使得训练比原本更深的分层模型成为可能，并且有助于减少使用分割VAE预测时不可避免的平铺伪影。我们将uSplit应用于五个分解任务，一个是合成数据集，另外四个来自实际显微镜数据。LC实现了SOTA的结果（平均im）",
