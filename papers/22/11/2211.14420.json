    "abstract": "Photo Rater is a computer vision project that uses neural networks to help photographers select the best photo among those that are taken based on the same scene. This process is usually referred to as \"culling\" in photography, and it can be tedious and time-consuming if done manually. Photo Rater utilizes three separate neural networks to complete such a task: one for general image quality assessment, one for classifying whether the photo is blurry (either due to unsteady hands or out-of-focusness), and one for assessing general aesthetics (including the composition of the photo, among others). After feeding the image through each neural network, Photo Rater outputs a final score for each image, ranking them based on this score and presenting it to the user.",

    "translated_abstract": "Photo Rater是一个计算机视觉项目，利用神经网络帮助摄影师在拍摄同一场景的照片中选择最佳照片。这个过程通常被称为“筛选”在摄影中，如果手动完成会很繁琐和耗时。Photo Rater利用三个独立的神经网络完成这样的任务：一个用于一般图像质量评估，一个用于分类照片是否模糊（因为手抖或者聚焦不准），一个用于评估整体审美（包括照片构图等）。在通过每个神经网络处理图像后，Photo Rater为每个图像输出一个最终得分，根据得分排名并呈现给用户。",
