    "translated_abstract": "强化学习面临的重大挑战之一是能够泛化到新任务。然而，泛化代理需要一组丰富、多样化的任务进行训练。为这些任务设计一个理想的环境很困难——理想的环境应支持一系列新兴现象、丰富的任务空间和快速的运行时。为了解决这个瓶颈问题，本文提出了Powderworld，一个直接在GPU上运行的轻量级但表现力强的模拟环境。在Powderworld内，提出了两个激发挑战的分布，一个用于世界建模，一个用于强化学习。每个分布都包含手动设计的测试任务，以检查泛化性能。实验表明，增加环境的复杂性可以改善世界模型和某些强化学习代理的泛化性能，但可能会抑制高方差环境下的学习。Powderworld旨在通过提供一种支持泛化研究的环境来解决这个问题。",
