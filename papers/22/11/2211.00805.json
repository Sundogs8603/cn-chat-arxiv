    "translated_abstract": "在数据科学中，高效计算分布之间的最优输运距离变得越来越重要。目前，Sinkhorn方法是这种计算的最先进方法，但需要$O(n^2)$的计算。此外，Sinkhorn方法通常使用数据点之间的欧几里德距离。然而，随着流形结构科学数据的普及，考虑浸润地面距离常常是需要的。在这里，我们通过在浸润曲面上扩散热核来解决这两个问题，提出了Geodesic Sinkhorn方法。值得注意的是，Geodesic Sinkhorn只需要$O(n\\log n)$的计算，因为我们使用基于稀疏图拉普拉斯矩阵的切比雪夫多项式来逼近热核。我们将我们的方法应用于计算化疗患者样本的高维单细胞数据的多个分布的几何中心。特别地，我们将几何中心之间的距离定义为这两个几何中心之间的距离。",
