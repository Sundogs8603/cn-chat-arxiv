    "translated_abstract": "本文致力于开发计算和通信效率高的多重检验网络方法，对许多实际应用具有重要意义。我们采用一种渐进的方法，并提出了两种针对分布式环境的方法：比例匹配和贪婪聚合。比例匹配方法实现了全局 BH（Benjamini–Hochberg）性能，仅需要通信一次（估计）真零假设比例以及每个节点的 p 值数量。通过关注渐进最优功率，我们超越了 BH 过程，并提供了渐近最优解的显式特征。这导致了贪心聚合方法，该方法有效地近似了每个节点的最优拒绝区域，而计算效率自然来自贪心类型方法。此外，对于这两种方法，我们提供了 FDR 和功率的收敛速度。在各种情况下进行的广泛数值结果表明了方法的实用性。",
