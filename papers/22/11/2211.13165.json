    "translated_abstract": "认知的数学模型通常是无记忆的，忽略了参数的潜在波动。然而，人类认知本质上是动态的。因此，我们提出在机械认知模型中引入时间维度，并从超统计学的角度估计所得到的动态性质。这样的模型包括了一个低级观测模型和一个高级转换模型之间的层次结构。观测模型描述了系统的局部行为，转换模型规定了观测模型参数随时间演化的方式。为了克服超统计模型复杂性带来的估计挑战，我们开发并验证了一种基于仿真的深度学习方法，用于贝叶斯推理，可以恢复时变和时不变参数。我们首先将我们的方法与两个已有的能够估计时变参数的框架进行基准测试。然后，我们将我们的方法应用于拟合动态版本的差分方程模型。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a neural superstatistics method for Bayesian estimation of dynamic cognitive models. By incorporating a temporal dimension and adopting a superstatistics perspective, the proposed method effectively captures the dynamic nature of cognition and utilizes simulation-based deep learning for Bayesian inference. It can recover both time-varying and time-invariant parameters and has been validated through benchmarking and simulations."
