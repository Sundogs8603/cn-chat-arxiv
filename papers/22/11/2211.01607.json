    "translated_abstract": "心血管疾病占非传染性疾病的近一半。冠状动脉的血管狭窄被认为是心血管疾病的主要风险。计算机断层扫描血管造影（CTA）是一种广泛应用于冠状动脉诊断的无创成像模式，由于其出色的图像分辨率。在临床上，冠状动脉的分割对于冠状动脉疾病的诊断和量化是必要的。最近，提出了各种方法来解决这个问题。然而，一方面，大多数工作依赖于自有数据集，只有少数工作将数据集发表到公众领域，其中只包含数十个图像。另一方面，它们的源代码尚未发布，大多数后续工作也没有与现有工作进行比较，这使得很难判断方法的有效性，并阻碍了社区对这个具有挑战性但关键性问题进一步的探索。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于计算机断层扫描血管造影图像的冠状动脉分割的大规模数据集和基准。",
