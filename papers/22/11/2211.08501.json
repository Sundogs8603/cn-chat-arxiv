    "abstract": "Agents care not only about the outcomes of collective decisions but also about how decisions are made. In many cases, both the outcome and the procedure affect whether agents see a decision as legitimate, justifiable, or acceptable. We propose a novel model for collective decisions that takes into account both the preferences of the agents and their higher order concerns about the process of preference aggregation. To this end we (1) propose natural, plausible preference structures and establish key properties thereof, (2) develop mechanisms for aggregating these preferences to maximize the acceptability of decisions, and (3) characterize the performance of our acceptance-maximizing mechanisms. We apply our general approach to the specific setting of dichotomous choice, and compare the worst-case rates of acceptance achievable among populations of agents of different types. We also show in the special case of rule selection, i.e., amendment procedures, the method proposed by Abramowitz",

    "translated_abstract": "代理人不仅关心集体决策的结果，还关心决策的方式。在许多情况下，决策的结果和过程都会影响代理人是否认为决策是合法、可辩解或可接受的。我们提出了一个新颖的集体决策模型，考虑了代理人的偏好和对偏好聚合过程的高阶关注。为此，我们（1）提出了自然、可信的偏好结构并建立了其关键属性；（2）开发了聚合这些偏好以最大化决策的接受度的机制；（3）对我们的最大化接受机制的性能进行了表征。我们将我们的通用方法应用于二选一选择的具体情景，并比较了不同类型的代理人群体中可实现的最差接受率。我们还在修正程序的特殊情况下展示了通过阿布拉莫维茨提出的方法。",
