    "abstract": "Exposure simulations are fundamental to many xVA calculations and are a nested expectation problem where repeated portfolio valuations create a significant computational expense. Sensitivity calculations which require shocked and unshocked valuations in bump-and-revalue schemes exacerbate the computational load. A known reduction of the portfolio valuation cost is understood to be found in polynomial approximations, which we apply in this article to interest rate sensitivities of expected exposures.  We consider a method based on the approximation of the shocked and unshocked valuation functions, as well as a novel approach in which the difference between these functions is approximated. Convergence results are shown, and we study the choice of interpolation nodes. Numerical experiments with interest rate derivatives are conducted to demonstrate the high accuracy and remarkable computational cost reduction. We further illustrate how the method can be extended to more general xVA models",

    "translated_abstract": "曝光模拟是许多xVA计算的基础，是一个嵌套期望问题，反复计算投资组合估值会产生巨大的计算开销。需要震荡和非震荡估值的灵敏度计算加剧了计算负载。已知可以通过多项式逼近来降低投资组合估值成本，在本文中我们将其应用于预期曝光的利率灵敏度计算。我们考虑了一种基于震荡和非震荡估值函数逼近的方法，以及一种逼近这些函数之间差值的新方法。我们展示了收敛结果，并研究了插值节点的选择。通过利率衍生品的数值实验，我们证明了该方法的高精度和显著的计算成本降低。我们进一步说明了如何将该方法扩展到更一般的xVA模型中。",
