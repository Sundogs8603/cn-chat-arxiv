    "abstract": "Originating from cooperative game theory, Shapley values have become one of the most widely used measures for variable importance in applied Machine Learning. However, the statistical understanding of Shapley values is still limited. In this paper, we take a nonparametric (or smoothing) perspective by introducing Shapley curves as a local measure of variable importance. We propose two estimation strategies and derive the consistency and asymptotic normality both under independence and dependence among the features. This allows us to construct confidence intervals and conduct inference on the estimated Shapley curves. We propose a novel version of the wild bootstrap procedure, specifically adjusted to give good finite sample coverage of the Shapley curves. The asymptotic results are validated in extensive experiments. In an empirical application, we analyze which attributes drive the prices of vehicles.",

    "translated_abstract": "源自合作博弈理论，Shapley值已成为应用机器学习中最广泛使用的变量重要性度量之一。然而，对Shapley值的统计理解仍然有限。本文以非参数(或平滑)的角度，引入Shapley曲线作为局部变量重要性的度量。我们提出了两种估计策略，并在特征独立和依赖的情况下都得出了一致性和渐近正态性。这样，我们可以构建置信区间并对估计的Shapley曲线进行推断。我们提出了一种新颖的野蛮引导程序版本，专门调整以获得Shapley曲线的良好有限样本覆盖。渐近结果在大量实验证实了。在实证应用中，我们分析了哪些属性驱动了车辆的价格。",
