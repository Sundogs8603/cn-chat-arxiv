    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了基于文本挖掘的单词类别分类方法和基于LSTM的词汇出现模式预测方法。首先描述了基于简单文本出现频率分析的预处理方法。这种方法被开发为数据筛选工具，但显示出比先前作品高4.35~6.21倍的性能。同时，还提出了使用LSTM深度学习方法进行词汇出现模式预测方法。AI使用不同大小的前几次考试的数据窗口进行回归，以预测下一次考试中单词出现的概率。AI在不同数据窗口上预测的值经过加权求和处理，得到一个称为“AI-Score”的单一得分，表示下一年考试中单词出现的概率。所建议的方法在100分范围内显示了100％的准确性，在得分超过60分的区域仅显示了1.7％的预测误差。所有源代码均可在作者的Git上免费获取。",
