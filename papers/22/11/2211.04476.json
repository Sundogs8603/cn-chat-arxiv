    "translated_abstract": "预训练的自然语言处理（NLP）模型取得了高整体性能，但仍然存在系统性的错误。与手动错误分析不同，对于自动识别表现不佳的数据组的片段检测模型（SDM）的研究，在计算机视觉领域引起了广泛关注，可以理解模型行为并为未来模型训练和设计提供见解。然而，在NLP任务上，对SDM的研究和其有效性的定量评估还很少。本文通过提出一个名为“Discover, Explain, Improve(DEIM)”的NLP分类任务基准和一个新的SDM模型Edisa来填补这一空白。Edisa发现了一致且表现不佳的数据组；DEIM将它们统一为人类可理解的概念，并提供了全面的评估任务和相应的定量指标。在DEIM的评估中，结果显示Edisa能够准确选择易出错的数据点，并提供了有用的信息。",
