    "translated_abstract": "连续学习是迈向终身智能的一步，其中模型可以持续从最近收集的数据中学习而不会遗忘先前的知识。现有的连续学习方法主要关注于具有清晰任务边界和无限计算预算的分类设置。本研究探讨了在线领域增量继续分割（ODICS）的问题，其中模型在不同领域的密集标记图像批次上进行连续训练，计算资源有限，并且没有关于任务边界的信息。ODICS在许多实际应用中出现。在自动驾驶中，这可能对应于在时间上对一系列城市中的分割模型进行训练的现实场景。我们分析了几种现有的连续学习方法，并展示了它们在这种设置中的性能较差，尽管在类别增量分割中表现良好。我们提出了一种新的方法SimCS，它采用增量领域学习和在线连续学习，并在多个数据集上进行了实验证明其有效性。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一个新的方法SimCS，用于解决在线领域增量继续分割的问题。与现有方法相比，SimCS在资源有限的情况下，对不同领域的密集标记图像进行连续训练，无需任务边界信息，展现了更好的性能。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new method, SimCS, to address the problem of Online Domain-Incremental Continual Segmentation (ODICS). Compared to existing methods, SimCS performs continuous training on batches of densely labeled images from different domains with limited resources, without the need for task boundary information, and achieves better performance."
