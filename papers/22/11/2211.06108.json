    "translated_abstract": "在自动驾驶系统中，激光雷达和雷达在感知周围环境中起着重要作用。激光雷达提供精确的三维空间感知信息，但在雾等恶劣天气下无法工作。另一方面，雷达信号由于波长的特性在遇到雨滴或雾粒时会发生衍射，但它受到大噪声的干扰。最近的最新研究表明，雷达和激光雷达的融合可以在恶劣天气下实现强健的检测。现有的方法采用卷积神经网络架构从每个传感器数据流中提取特征，然后对齐和汇聚两个分支的特征以预测物体检测结果。然而，由于标签分配和融合策略的简单设计，这些方法对边界框估计的准确性较低。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于鸟瞰视角融合学习的引导框自由物体检测系统，该系统将来自雷达的距离-方位特征融合起来",
