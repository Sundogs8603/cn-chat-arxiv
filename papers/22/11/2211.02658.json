    "translated_abstract": "最近，机器学习 (ML) 已成为支持自适应的热门方法。ML 已被用来处理自适应中的几个问题，例如在不确定性下维护最新的运行时模型和可扩展的决策制定。然而，利用 ML 存在固有的挑战。在本文中，我们着重讨论面向基于学习的自适应系统的一个特别重要的挑战：适应空间中的漂移。通过适应空间，我们指的是自适应系统在某一特定时间可以选择的适应选项的集合，以根据适应选项的质量属性进行适应。适应空间的漂移源于影响适应选项质量属性的不确定性。这种漂移可能意味着最终没有适应选项能够满足最初的适应目标，从而降低系统的质量，或者可能出现允许增强适应目标的适应选项。在 ML 中，这种漂移通常被称为概念漂移或实例漂移。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种名为“生命周期自适应”的新方法。生命周期自适应对 ML powered self-adaptation 进行了扩展，使其能够更好地处理适应空间的漂移。",
