    "translated_abstract": "工程设计过程通常依赖于能够描述底层动态行为的数学建模。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种数据驱动的方法来对非线性系统的动力学建模。为了简化这个任务，我们的目标是找到一个坐标转换，使我们能够使用一个常见的简单模型结构来表示非线性系统的动力学。常见简单模型的优点在于可以将为其开发的定制设计工具应用于研究各种非线性系统。最简单的常见模型可以认为是线性的，但线性系统往往无法准确捕捉非线性系统的复杂动力学。在这项工作中，我们提出使用二次系统作为常见结构，受到升维原理的启发。根据这一原理，光滑的非线性系统可以在适当的坐标中表示为二次系统，而不会产生近似误差。然而，仅仅通过数值方法找到这些坐标是困难的，所以我们提出使用深度学习来学习这些坐标。",
