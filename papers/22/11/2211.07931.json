    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）是一种去中心化的机器学习技术，使得多个客户端可以协作训练模型，而无需客户端相互揭示其原始数据。虽然传统的FL训练单一的全局模型，表现在客户端的平均性能，但是跨客户端的统计数据异质性促使了个性化联邦学习（PFL）的发展，该方法可以在每个客户端的数据上训练个性化的模型，并具有良好的性能。PFL面临的一个关键挑战是如何在每个客户端具有来自复杂分布的数据且不能确定彼此的分布的情况下促进拥有相似数据的客户端进行更多协作。本文提出了一种基于多分支结构的新型PFL方法(pFedMB)，通过将神经网络的每个层分成多个分支并为每个分支分配客户端特定的权重来实现个性化。我们还设计了一种聚合方法，以提高pFedMB的通信效率并降低计算开销。通过对合成数据和真实世界数据的实验，我们证明了pFedMB在个性化和通信效率方面都能够达到最先进的性能。",

A new aggregation method is also designed to improve communication efficiency and reduce computational overhead. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that pFedMB can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of both personalization and communication efficiency, while facilitating clients with similar data to collaborate more in a situation with complex distribution and uncertain distribution among each other."
