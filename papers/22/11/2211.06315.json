    "translated_abstract": "金融欺诈每年造成数十亿美元的损失，但目前缺乏有效的方法来同时考虑社交网络中用户的个人资料和行为以检测欺诈。社交网络形成了一个图形结构，而图神经网络（GNN）是深度学习中一个有前途的研究领域，可以无缝处理非欧几里得图形数据。在金融欺诈检测中，通过分析用户的个人资料和行为（如交易、贷款等）以及他们的社交联系，可以识别犯罪分子的作案方式。目前，大多数GNN无法选择重要的邻居，因为邻居的边属性（即行为）被忽略了。本文提出了一种新颖的行为信息聚合网络（BIAN），将用户的行为与其他用户特征相结合。与其近亲Graph Attention Networks（GAT）和Graph Transformer Networks（GTN）不同，它基于相邻边属性进行邻域聚合。",
