    "translated_abstract": "保险中的后验费率制定利用贝叶斯可信度模型来升级合同的当前保费，考虑到投保人的属性和索赔记录。大多数用于此任务的数据驱动模型在数学上是难以处理的，因此必须通过数值方法如MCMC等模拟方法来获得保费。然而，这些方法在策略保持者层面上进行时，对于大型投资组合而言计算代价昂贵且具有限制性。此外，这些计算变成了“黑盒”处理，因为没有表达式显示如何使用策略保持者的索赔历史来升级其保费。为了解决这些挑战，本文提出采用代理建模方法，以便于低成本地为任何给定模型计算出贝叶斯可信度保费的封闭式表达式。作为方法的一部分，本文介绍了“可信度指数”，它是策略保持者索赔的摘要统计信息。",
    "tldr": "本文针对保险中高效的后验费率制定问题，提出了使用代理模型方法来获得封闭式表达式计算保费的方案，同时引进了可信度指数作为保费计算的摘要统计信息，避免了因计算代价高昂或计算过程成为“黑盒”而带来的限制。"
