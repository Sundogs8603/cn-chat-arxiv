In the online learning setting, the quality of an agent's decision is often quantified by the concept of regret, comparing the performance of the chosen decisions to the best possible ones in hindsight. While regret is a useful performance measure, when dynamical systems are concerned, it is important to also assess the stability of the closed-loop system for a chosen policy. In this work, we show that for linear state feedback policies and linear systems subject to adversarial disturbances, linear regret implies asymptotic stability in both time-varying and time-invariant settings.

    "translated_abstract": "在最优控制、强化学习和近期的在线学习领域中，代理机器人在不确定性和动态限制下进行决策是很常见的。在在线学习设置中，代理机器人的决策质量通常被遗憾概念所度量，比较所选策略和最优解后悔的差距。虽然遗憾是一个有用的性能度量指标，但当考虑到动态系统时，评估所选策略的闭环系统的稳定性也很重要。在本文中，我们展示了对于线性状态反馈策略和受到对抗性干扰的线性系统，线性遗憾概念在时变和时不变设置下都暗示渐进稳定性。反之，我们也证明了有界输入的有界状态稳定性和状态转移矩阵的可加性意味着线性遗憾。",

The results show that linear regret implies asymptotic stability in linear state feedback policies and linear systems subject to adversarial disturbances, while the bounded input bounded state stability and summability of the state transition matrices also imply linear regret."
