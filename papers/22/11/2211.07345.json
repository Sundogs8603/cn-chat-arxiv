    "abstract": "This tutorial is an andragogical guide for students and practitioners seeking to understand the fundamentals and practice of linear programming. The exercises demonstrate how to solve classical optimization problems with an emphasis on spatial analysis in supply chain management and transport logistics. All exercises display the Python programs and optimization libraries used to solve them. The first chapter introduces key concepts in linear programming and contributes a new cognitive framework to help students and practitioners set up each optimization problem. The cognitive framework organizes the decision variables, constraints, the objective function, and variable bounds in a format for direct application to optimization software. The second chapter introduces two types of mobility optimization problems (shortest path in a network and minimum cost tour) in the context of delivery and service planning logistics. The third chapter introduces four types of spatial optimization problem",
