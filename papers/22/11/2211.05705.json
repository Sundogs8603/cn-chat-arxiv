    "translated_abstract": "近几十年来，基于方面情感分析（ABSA）的快速发展展现出在现实世界中的巨大潜力。然而，当前的ABSA工作大多限于单个文本场景，缺乏对话上下文的研究。为了弥合细粒度情感分析和对话中观点挖掘之间的差距，在本文中，我们引入了一项新的任务，即基于对话的方面情感四元组分析（DiaASQ），旨在检测对话中的目标-方面-观点-情感四元组。我们手动构建了一个大规模的高质量DiaASQ数据集，涵盖中文和英文两种语言。我们开发了一种神经模型来进行基准测试，该模型在有效地执行端到端四元组预测方面取得了进展，并设法结合丰富的对话特定和话语特征表示，以实现更好的跨话语四元组提取。我们希望这一新的基准将激发更多的进展。",
