    "abstract": "Reservoir computing, a recurrent neural network paradigm in which only the output layer is trained, has demonstrated remarkable performance on tasks such as prediction and control of nonlinear systems. Recently, it was demonstrated that adding time-shifts to the signals generated by a reservoir can provide large improvements in performance accuracy. In this work, we present a technique to choose the time-shifts by maximizing the rank of the reservoir matrix using a rank-revealing QR algorithm. This technique, which is not task dependent, does not require a model of the system, and therefore is directly applicable to analog hardware reservoir computers. We demonstrate our time-shift selection technique on two types of reservoir computer: one based on an opto-electronic oscillator and the traditional recurrent network with a $tanh$ activation function. We find that our technique provides improved accuracy over random time-shift selection in essentially all cases.",

    "translated_abstract": "蓄水池计算是一种仅对输出层进行训练的递归神经网络，已经在非线性系统预测和控制等任务中表现出卓越的性能。最近，研究发现在蓄水池中加入时间偏移可以显著提高性能准确性。本文提出了一种使用QR分解算法最大化蓄水池矩阵秩来选择时间偏移的技术。该技术不依赖于特定任务，不需要系统模型，因此直接适用于模拟硬件蓄水池计算。我们将时间偏移选择技术应用于两种类型的蓄水池计算：基于光电振荡器和传统递归网络的$tanh$激活函数。研究结果表明，相比随机选择时间偏移，我们的技术在几乎所有情况下提供了更高的准确性。",
