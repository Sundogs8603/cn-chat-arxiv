    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络(GNNs)被广泛用于建模由图中顶点表示的实体之间的复杂互动。尽管最近有一些理论分析GNNs表达能力的努力，但对其模拟相互作用的能力缺乏一个正式的描述。本文旨在填补这一空白。通过一个已知的度量标准——分离秩(separation rank)来规范化相互作用的强度，我们量化了某些GNNs模拟给定顶点子集及其补集之间交互的能力，即输入顶点组成的给定分区的两侧之间的互动。我们的结果表明，模拟相互作用的能力主要取决于分区的行走指数(walk index)——一个由分界线开始的行走数量定义的图形特征。常见GNN架构的实验证明了这一发现。作为我们理论的实际应用，我们设计了一种名为Walk Indexed Sparsification Algorithm (WISA)的边稀疏化算法，利用我们的研究结果提高处理大规模图形的GNNs效率同时保持它们的表达能力。",
