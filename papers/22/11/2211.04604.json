    "translated_abstract": "在人类环境中运作的机器人必须能够将物体重新排列成语义有意义的配置，即使这些物体以前没见过。本文关注如何在无需逐步指令的情况下构建物理有效的结构。我们提出了StructDiffusion，该方法结合了扩散模型和以物体为中心的转换器，根据局部视点云和高级语言目标（如“摆桌子”），构建结构。我们的方法可以使用一个模型执行多个具有挑战性的语言条件的多步骤3D规划任务。与训练在特定结构上的现有多模态转换器模型相比，StructDiffusion甚至提高了将未知对象组装成物理有效结构的成功率，平均可提高16％。我们展示了模拟和实际重新排列任务中使用保留对象的实验。重要的是，我们展示了如何将扩散模型和碰撞鉴别器模型结合起来，以实现对拟合性以及对语言指导物理有效结构构建任务的影响。",
