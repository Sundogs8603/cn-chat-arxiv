    "translated_abstract": "基于方面的情感分析（ABSA）旨在从评论文本中提取具有意见的方面词汇并确定它们的情感极性，在学术界和工业界都得到广泛研究。作为一项细粒度的分类任务，标注成本非常高。领域适应是解决新领域数据不足的常用方法，通过在领域之间转移共有知识来减小差距。大多数跨领域ABSA研究基于结构对应学习（SCL），并使用中介特征构建辅助任务以缩小领域之间的差距。然而，它们基于中介的辅助任务只能传递关于方面词汇而不是情感的知识，限制了现有模型的性能。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于语法指导的领域适应模型，命名为SDAM，用于更有效地进行跨领域ABSA。SDAM利用句法结构相似性来构建伪训练实例，其中目标领域的方面词汇与源领域的相似。",
