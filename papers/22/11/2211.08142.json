We use the encoder of a sequence-to-sequence architecture, trained on visually different but mathematically equivalent expressions, to generate vector representations (or embeddings). We compare this approach with an autoencoder and show that the former is better at capturing mathematical semantics.

    "translated_abstract": "数学符号在STEM文献中占据了很大一部分，但是，为公式找到语义表示仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。由于数学符号是精确的，在字符微小变化时其含义会发生显著变化，因此适用于自然文本的方法并不一定适用于数学表达式。在这项工作中，我们描述了一种在连续向量空间中表示数学表达式的方法。我们使用一个序列到序列框架的编码器，训练其在视觉上不同但在数学上等价的表达式上生成向量表示（或嵌入）。我们将这种方法与自动编码器进行比较，并表明前者更能捕捉数学语义。最后，为了促进未来的研究，我们发布了一份等价的超越和代数表达式对的语料库。",
