    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了过度参数化的分类器的泛化能力，其中通过经验风险最小化（ERM）学习导致零训练误差。在这些过度参数化的设置中，有许多具有零训练误差的全局最小值，其中一些比其他的更具有普适性。我们表明，在一定的条件下，“坏”全局最小值的分数，其真实误差大于ε，与训练数据n的数量指数级地递减到零。该范围取决于用于给定分类问题的分类器函数集合上真实误差的分布，不一定取决于分类器函数集合的大小或复杂度（例如参数数量）。这可能解释了即使高度参数化的神经网络也具有出乎意料的良好泛化能力。我们在合成数据集和MNIST的子集上通过实验来支持我们的数学框架。",
    "tldr": "本文研究发现，在过度参数化的情况下，零训练误差的全局最小值中“坏”方案的占比随训练数据的增加而指数级递减，并能解释高度参数化的神经网络具有出乎意料的良好泛化能力。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper found that in the case of over-parameterization, the proportion of \"bad\" solutions among the global minima with zero training error decreases exponentially with the increase of training data, which can explain why highly over-parameterized Neural Networks still have unexpectedly good generalization performance."
