    "translated_abstract": "从多个网站汇集公开可用的MRI数据可以组装大量受试对象，增加统计功率，并通过机器学习技术促进数据重用。多中心数据的协调是减少数据中与非生物来源的变异度量的混杂效应的必要条件。然而，将协调应用于机器学习之前的整个数据集会导致数据泄漏，因为训练集之外的信息可能会影响模型构建并可能导致性能过高。我们提出了1）数据协调的有效性测量方法；2）“调和器变压器”，即ComBat协调方法的一个实现，它允许将其封装在机器学习的预处理步骤中，避免数据泄漏。我们使用了来自36个网站的1740名健康受试者的大脑T1加权MRI数据来测试这些工具。经过协调后，网站效应被删除或减少了，",
