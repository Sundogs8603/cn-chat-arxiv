Variational algorithms are typically optimized using gradient-based approaches however these are difficult to implement on current noisy devices, requiring large numbers of objective function evaluations. Our scheme shifts this computational burden onto the classical optimizer component of these hybrid algorithms, greatly reducing the number of queries to the quantum processor. We focus on the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm and demonstrate numerically that such surrogate models are particularly well suited to the algorithm's objective function. Next, we apply these models to both noiseless and noisy VQE simulations and show that they exhibit better performance than widely-used classical kernels in terms of final accuracy and convergence speed.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的优化方法，用于在噪声近期量子处理器上进行小规模至中等规模的变分算法，该方法使用配备经典评估的量子内核的高斯过程代理模型。传统上，变分算法使用基于梯度的方法进行优化，但在当前的噪声设备上实施起来很困难，需要大量的目标函数评估。我们的方案将这个计算负担转移到这些混合算法的经典优化器组件上，大大减少了对量子处理器的查询次数。我们重点研究变分量子特征值求解器（VQE）算法，并经过数值验证表明，这种代理模型特别适用于该算法的目标函数。接下来，我们将这些模型应用到无噪声和有噪声的VQE模拟中，并展示它们在最终准确度和收敛速度方面比广泛使用的经典内核表现更好。",
