    "abstract": "People rely heavily on context to enrich meaning beyond what is literally said, enabling concise but effective communication. To interact successfully and naturally with people, user-facing artificial intelligence systems will require similar skills in pragmatics: relying on various types of context -from shared linguistic goals and conventions, to the visual and embodied world -- to use language effectively. We survey existing grounded settings and pragmatic modeling approaches and analyze how the task goals, environmental contexts, and communicative affordances in each work enrich linguistic meaning. We present recommendations for future grounded task design to naturally elicit pragmatic phenomena, and suggest directions that focus on a broader range of communicative contexts and affordances.",

    "translated_abstract": "人们在交流中经常依赖上下文来丰富言外之意，从而实现简明而有效的沟通。为了能够与人类成功地自然交互，面向用户的人工智能系统将需要类似的语用学技能：依靠各种上下文信息——从共享的语言目标和约定到视觉和具身世界，有效地使用语言。我们调查了现有的语境设置和语用建模方法，并分析了每个工作中任务目标、环境上下文和交际效益如何丰富语言含义。我们提出了未来基础任务设计的建议，以自然地引出语用学现象，并建议关注更广泛的交流上下文和效益的方向。",
