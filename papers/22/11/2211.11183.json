    "translated_abstract": "医疗领域一直面临着治疗差异的持续问题，引发了关于临床实践中治疗分配公平性的担忧。虽然出现了各种公平度量指标用于评估决策过程中的公平性，但越来越多的关注点集中在基于因果性的公平概念上，因为它们可以减轻混杂效应并推断偏差。然而，在评估基于电子健康记录（EHR）数据的临床决策公平性时，因果公平概念的应用仍然是一个未经研究的领域。本研究旨在填补在使用电子健康记录数据评估治疗分配的因果公平性方面的方法论空白。我们提出了一种因果公平算法来评估临床决策的公平性。我们的算法考虑了患者群体的异质性，并通过对具有相同可能性的患者进行调整，以确定治疗分配中的潜在不公平性。",
