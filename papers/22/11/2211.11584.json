    "translated_abstract": "为了支持机器学习跨语言的韵律映射和其他提高语音-语音翻译的方法，我们提出了一种在不同语言之间收集紧密匹配的话语对的协议，描述了所得到的数据集以及其公开发布的情况，并附上了一些观察和思考。本报告面向：使用该语料库的人士、扩展该语料库的人士以及设计类似的双语对话数据集的人士。",
    "tldr": "该论文介绍了一种用于收集跨语言话语对的协议，并公开了相关数据集，以支持机器学习跨语言韵律映射等领域的研究。该研究对于使用该语料库、扩展该语料库以及设计类似双语对话数据集的人士具有重要意义。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a protocol for collecting closely matched pairs of utterances across languages, along with the release of the resulting data, to support machine learning of cross-language prosodic mappings and other speech-to-speech translation improvements. It is intended for users, developers, and researchers working with similar bilingual dialog data collections."
