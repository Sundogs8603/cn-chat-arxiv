    "translated_abstract": "图卷积网络是一种处理可表示为图的数据的人工神经网络。由于金融交易可以自然地构造成图形，因此GCN在金融行业中得到了广泛应用，特别是在金融欺诈检测方面。本文重点研究加密货币信任网络中的欺诈检测。在现有文献中，大部分工作都集中在静态图上。而在本研究中，我们考虑了加密货币网络的演化特性，并利用本地结构和平衡理论来指导训练过程。具体而言，我们计算动态网络中的模式矩阵来捕捉局部拓扑信息，然后在GCN聚合过程中使用它们。每个快照生成的嵌入是时间窗口内嵌入的加权平均值，其中权重是可学习的参数。由于信任网络在每个边缘上都有签名，因此使用平衡理论来指导训练过程。实验结果表明，我们提出的基于模式感知的时态GCN在真实数据和合成数据集上均比现有的方法具有优异的性能。",
