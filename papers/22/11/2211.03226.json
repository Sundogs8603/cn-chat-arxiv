    "translated_abstract": "在玻璃液体研究领域，使用机器学习（ML）对粒子的静态结构进行建模是一个热门话题。最先进的方法是使用图神经网络（GNN），它具有强大的表达能力，但是模型参数多且缺乏可解释性。受机器学习群等变表示领域的最新进展的启发，我们构建了一个GNN，通过约束其保持旋转平移（SE（3））等变性，学习玻璃静态结构的稳健表示。我们发现，这种约束不仅显著提高了预测能力，还提高了对未见过温度的泛化能力，同时可以减少参数数量。此外，解释性也得到了改善，因为我们可以将基本卷积层的作用与众所周知的旋转不变专家特征联系起来。通过迁移学习实验，我们证明了我们的网络学习了一个稳健的表示。",

This constraint significantly improves predictive power, generalization ability, and interpretability, with reduced parameter count. The effectiveness of the network is demonstrated through transfer learning experiments."
