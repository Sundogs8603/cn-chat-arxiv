    "abstract": "Recent works have demonstrated that natural language can be used to generate and edit 3D shapes. However, these methods generate shapes with limited fidelity and diversity. We introduce CLIP-Sculptor, a method to address these constraints by producing high-fidelity and diverse 3D shapes without the need for (text, shape) pairs during training. CLIP-Sculptor achieves this in a multi-resolution approach that first generates in a low-dimensional latent space and then upscales to a higher resolution for improved shape fidelity. For improved shape diversity, we use a discrete latent space which is modeled using a transformer conditioned on CLIP's image-text embedding space. We also present a novel variant of classifier-free guidance, which improves the accuracy-diversity trade-off. Finally, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating that CLIP-Sculptor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. The code is available at https://ivl.cs.brown.edu/#/projects/clip-sculptor.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，自然语言可以用于生成和编辑三维形状。然而，这些方法生成的形状保真度和多样性有限。我们介绍了 CLIP-Sculptor，一种方法，通过在训练期间不需要（文本，形状）对，就可以产生高保真度和多样性的三维形状，它采用多分辨率方法，首先在低维潜在空间中生成，然后提升分辨率以获得更好的形状保真度，而离散潜在空间使用了 transformer 来建模，并通过 CLIP 的图像-文本嵌入空间进行条件化。我们还提出了一种新颖的不需要分类器的指导方法，提高了准确性-多样性的平衡。最后，我们进行了大量实验，证明了 CLIP-Sculptor 优于现有的基准方法。代码可在 https://ivl.cs.brown.edu/#/projects/clip-sculptor 下载。",
