    "translated_abstract": "$k$-means算法是一种常用的聚类方法，因其简单、有效和快速而受到广泛关注。然而，其主要缺点是对聚类中心的初始位置非常敏感。全局$k$-means是一种确定性算法，用于解决$k$-means的随机初始化问题，但众所周知其计算成本很高。它通过逐步解决所有$k$-means子问题，将数据划分为$K$个簇，其中$k=1,\\ldots, K$。对于每个$k$簇问题，该方法执行$k$-means算法$N$次，其中$N$是数据点的数量。在本文中，我们提出了全局$k$-means\\texttt{++}聚类算法，这是一种有效的获取质量聚类解的方法，与全局$k$-means相比，计算负载减少了。这是通过利用在$k$-means\\texttt{++}算法中有效使用的中心选择概率来实现的。",
