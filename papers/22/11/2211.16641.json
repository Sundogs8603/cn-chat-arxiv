This work utilizes the scanner data of supermarket retail sales, which are provided by China Ant Business Alliance (CAA), to construct the Scanner-data Food Consumer Price Index (S-FCPI) in China, and the index reliability is verified by other macro indicators, especially by China's CPI. And not only that, we build multiple machine learning models based on S-FCPI to quantitatively predict the CPI growth rate in months, and qualitatively predict those directions and levels. The prediction models achieve much better performance than the traditional time series models in existing research.

S-FCPI can not only reflect the changes of goods prices in higher frequency and wider geographic dimension than CPI, but also provide a new perspective for monitoring macroeconomic operation, predicting inflation and understanding",

    "translated_abstract": "扫描仪大数据有潜力构建消费者物价指数（CPI）。本研究利用中国蚂蚁商户联盟提供的超市零售销售的扫描仪数据，构建中国的扫描仪食品消费价格指数（S-FCPI），并通过其他宏观指标，特别是中国的CPI来验证指数的可靠性。此外，我们基于S-FCPI构建了多个机器学习模型，以定量预测月度CPI增长率，并定性预测其方向和水平。与现有研究中的传统时间序列模型相比，预测模型的性能显著提高。这项工作为利用扫描仪大数据构建和预测价格指数在中国铺平了道路。S-FCPI不仅可以以比CPI更高的频率和更广泛的地理维度反映商品价格的变化，还可以为监测宏观经济运行、预测通胀和理解经济趋势提供新的视角。",
