Second, we describe a technique to enforce certain classes of boundary conditions onto normalizing flows. Third, we introduce the I-Spline bijection, which, similar to previous work, leverages splines but, in contrast to those works, can be made arbitrarily often differentiable. And finally, we use these techniques to create Waveflow, an Ansatz for the one-space-dimensional multi-particle fermionic wave functions in real space based on normalizing flows, that can be efficiently trained with Variational Quantum Monte Carlo without the need for MCMC nor estimation of a normalization constant. To enforce the necessary anti-symmetry of fermionic wave functions, we train the normalizing flow only on the fundamental domain of the permutation group, which effectively reduces it to a boundary value problem.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了四个主要的创新点。首先，我们介绍了一种处理归一化流拓扑问题的新方法。其次，我们描述了一种在归一化流上强制施加特定类别边界条件的技术。第三，我们引入了 I-Spline 双射，它像之前的工作一样利用了样条曲线，但与这些工作不同的是，它可以被制作成任意次可微的。最后，我们使用这些技术创建了 Waveflow，一种基于归一化流的一维多粒子费米波函数的 Ansatz，它可以通过变分量子蒙特卡罗高效地训练，无需 MCMC 或估计归一化常数。为了强制费米波函数所需的反对称性，我们仅在排列群的基本域上训练归一化流，这有效地将其减少为一个边界值问题。",
