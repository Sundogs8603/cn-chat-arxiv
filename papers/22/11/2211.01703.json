    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在以下假设下的$2\\times 2$零和博弈：$(1)$其中一位玩家（领导者）承诺通过采样给定的概率分布（策略）来选择他的动作;$(2)$领导者宣布他的动作，这个动作通过二进制信道被对手（追随者）观察到;$(3)$追随者基于领导者的策略和领导者动作的噪声观测来选择她的策略。在这些条件下，平衡点被证明总是存在的。有趣的是，即使受到噪声的影响，观察领导者的行动对追随者来说实质上要么是有益的，要么是无关紧要的。具体而言，在这个博弈的均衡点上，收益被上界限制为纯策略下SE的收益；并且下界为纳什均衡的收益，这等价于混合策略下的SE。最后，我们提供了必要和充分的条件来观察均衡点的收益。",
