    "translated_abstract": "计算机视觉任务所需的许多高级技能，例如解析问题、比较和对比语义以及编写描述，也同样适用于其他领域，例如自然语言处理。本文探讨了是否可能从文本数据中学习这些技能，然后在没有对视觉训练数据进行训练的情况下将它们转移到视觉任务中。我们的方法的关键在于利用对比训练的视觉和语言编码器的联合嵌入空间。实践中，对比模型中不同模态的嵌入空间之间可能存在系统性差异，我们分析了这些差异如何影响我们的方法，并研究了缓解此问题的策略。我们使用仅 文本训练数据在四个代表性任务上生成模型：图像字幕、视觉蕴含、视觉问答和视觉新闻，并使用图像对标准基准进行评估。我们发现这些模型通常表现接近。",
