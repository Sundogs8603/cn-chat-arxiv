    "translated_abstract": "放射学报告摘要（RRS）是一个不断发展的研究领域。给定放射学报告的发现部分，目标是生成一个概述（称为印象部分），突出放射学研究的关键观察和结论。然而，RRS目前面临着重要的限制。首先，许多先前的研究使用私有数据集进行实验，无法重现结果并在不同系统和解决方案之间进行公平比较。其次，大多数先前的方法仅在胸部X射线上进行评估。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一个数据集（MIMIC-RRS），涉及MIMIC-III和MIMIC-CXR数据集的三种新的模态和七种新的解剖学。然后，我们进行了大量实验，评估了模型在MIMIC-RRS中的模态-解剖学对内和对外的性能。此外，我们通过RadGraph评估它们的临床功效，这是一个事实正确性指标。",
