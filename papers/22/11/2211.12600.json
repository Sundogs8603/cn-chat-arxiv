    "translated_abstract": "卷积神经网络是许多深度学习应用的最先进解决方案。为了最大程度的可伸缩性，它们的计算应该结合高性能和能源效率。在实践中，每个CNN层的卷积都被映射到一个矩阵乘法中，并包括每层的所有输入特征和卷积核，这个过程是使用并行阵列进行计算的。在这项工作中，我们关注的是带有可配置流水线的并行阵列的设计，目标是选择每个CNN层的最佳流水线配置。所提出的并行阵列称为ArrayFlex，可以在正常或浅流水线模式下运行，从而平衡执行周期时间和操作时钟频率。通过选择每个CNN层的适当流水线配置，ArrayFlex将最先进的CNN的推理延迟平均缩短了11％，与传统的固定流水线并行阵列相比。最重要的是，在使用比固定流水线阵列少13％的能量的同时实现了这个结果。",
