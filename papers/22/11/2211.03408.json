RITA is developed with consideration of three key features, i.e., fidelity, diversity, and controllability, and consists of two core modules called RITABackend and RITAKit. RITABackend is built to support vehicle-wise control and provide traffic generation models from real-world datasets, while RITAKit is developed with easy-to-use interfaces for controllable traffic gen",

    "translated_abstract": "高质量的交通流生成是构建自动驾驶模拟器的核心模块。 然而，大部分可用的模拟器无法复制准确反映现实世界数据各种特征的交通模式，并同时模拟对测试自动驾驶策略的人类反应。为解决这一问题，我们提出了Realistic Interactive TrAffic flow (RITA)作为现有驾驶模拟器的集成组件，为测试和优化驾驶策略提供高质量的交通流。 RITA的开发考虑了三个关键特征，即真实度，多样性和可控性，由称为RITABackend和RITAKit的两个核心模块组成。 RITABackend支持车辆控制，并提供来自真实世界数据集的交通生成模型，而RITAKit则开发了易于使用的接口，以在模拟场景中生成可控的交通流。",
