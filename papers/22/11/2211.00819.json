    "translated_abstract": "医疗保健中的生存建模依赖于可解释的统计模型，但其潜在假设往往过于简单和不切实际。机器学习模型可以估计更复杂的关系并导致更精确的预测，但是它们是不可解释的。本研究表明可以通过30秒单导联心电图信号估计心力衰竭住院。使用机器学习方法不仅具有更强的预测能力，还提供临床有意义的解释。我们训练了一个极限梯度提升加速故障时间模型，并利用Shapley Additive exPlanations值解释每个特征对预测的影响。我们的模型在6,573名患者的测试集上取得了一年的协调指数为0.828，一年和两年的曲线下面积分别为0.853和0.858。这些结果表明，基于心电图的快速测试可能对定位和治疗至关重要。",
