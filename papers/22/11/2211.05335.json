    "translated_abstract": "推动空中自主技术进步的一个重要障碍是获取用于训练机器学习模型的大规模空中数据集。为了避免实机数据采集的高成本和耗时，越来越多的无人机应用开始使用合成数据来训练模型。然而，要想提高模型的泛化能力并将其迁移到实际环境，增加模拟环境的多样性以训练所有可能情况下的模型，以及增加训练数据进行数据增强，都是必不可少的。目前，现有的合成空中数据生成工具要么缺乏数据增强，要么依赖于手工负载或实际样本进行配置和生成多样化的真实模拟场景以进行数据采集。这些依赖性限制了数据生成工作流程的可扩展性。因此，在合成数据生成中平衡泛化能力和可扩展性是一个主要的挑战。",
