    "translated_abstract": "因果结构学习在机器学习和各种应用中得到了广泛研究和应用。为了达到理想的性能，现有的因果结构学习算法通常需要将来自多个数据源的大量数据集中在一起。然而，在隐私保护的设置中，不可能将所有数据集中并放在一个数据集中。为了保护数据隐私，联邦学习作为一种新的学习范式在近年来在机器学习中引起了广泛关注。在本文中，我们研究了联合设置中的隐私感知因果结构学习问题，并提出了一种新的联邦PC（FedPC）算法，采用两种新策略来保护数据隐私而不集中数据。具体而言，我们首先提出了一种新的逐层聚合策略，将PC算法平稳地适应到联邦学习范式中，以实现联合骨架学习，然后我们设计了一种有效的策略。",
