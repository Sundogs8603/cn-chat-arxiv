    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了DyFOS，一种动态寻找最佳状态以最小化定位不确定性的主动感知方法，同时避免障碍和遮挡。我们考虑了一个感知受限的漫游器依靠来自观察者机器人的位置和不确定性测量来定位自己沿着充满障碍物的路径的情景。观察者的传感器的位置不确定性是传感器本身、漫游器和周围环境状态的函数。为了找到最小化漫游器定位不确定性的最佳传感器状态，DyFOS使用定位不确定性预测流水线进行优化搜索。给定上述状态的大量样本，流水线借助训练有素的复杂状态相关传感器测量模型（概率神经网络）预测漫游器的定位不确定性。我们的流水线还预测遮挡和障碍碰撞，以去除不可取的观察者状态并减少不必要计算。",
