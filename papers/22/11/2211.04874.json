    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了多任务函数线性回归模型，其中协变量和未知回归系数（称为斜率函数）均为曲线。为了斜率函数估计，我们采用罚化样条来平衡偏差、方差和计算复杂度。多任务学习的优势在于通过对斜率函数施加额外的结构。我们提出了一个通用模型，通过对样条系数矩阵进行双重正则化：i）矩阵流形约束，和ii）一个由二次项求和构成的复合惩罚。许多多任务学习方法都可以被视为该提出模型的特例，例如降秩模型和图拉普拉斯正则化模型。我们展示了复合惩罚引入了一种特定的范数，有助于量化流形的曲率，并确定流形切空间中相应的适当子集。然后，切空间子集的复杂度与几何流形的复杂度相联系。",
