    "translated_abstract": "多任务学习（MTL）是一种广泛使用且强大的学习范式，用于训练深度神经网络，可以通过单个骨干学习多个目标。与单独训练任务相比，MTL显着降低了计算成本，提高了数据效率，并通过利用任务之间的知识来潜在地提高模型性能。因此，它已经被应用于各种应用领域，从计算机视觉到自然语言处理和语音识别。其中，MTL的一个新兴研究方向集中在操纵任务梯度以推导出对所有任务有益的最终梯度下降方向。尽管在许多基准测试上取得了令人印象深刻的结果，但是在实际问题上直接应用这些方法而不使用适当的正则化技术可能会导致次优解。特别是，标准训练在训练数据上最小化经验损失，很容易遭受过拟合问题。",
