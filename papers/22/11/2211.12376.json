    "abstract": "We develop a novel observation-driven model for high-frequency prices. We account for irregularly spaced observations, simultaneous transactions, discreteness of prices, and market microstructure noise. The relation between trade durations and price volatility, as well as intraday patterns of trade durations and price volatility, is captured using smoothing splines. The dynamic model is based on the zero-inflated Skellam distribution with time-varying volatility in a score-driven framework. Market microstructure noise is filtered by including a moving average component. The model is estimated by the maximum likelihood method. In an empirical study of the IBM stock, we demonstrate that the model provides a good fit to the data. Besides modeling intraday volatility, it can also be used to measure daily realized volatility.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的基于观测的高频价格模型。我们考虑了不规则时间间隔观测、同时交易、价格离散性和市场微观结构噪声。使用平滑样条捕捉交易持续时间与价格波动性之间的关系，以及交易持续时间和价格波动性的日内模式。动态模型基于具有时间变化波动性的零膨胀Skellam分布的得分驱动框架。通过包括移动平均分量来滤除市场微观结构噪声。该模型采用最大似然方法进行估计。在对IBM股票的实证研究中，我们证明了该模型对数据拟合较好。除了对日内波动性建模外，它还可以用于测量每日实现波动性。",
