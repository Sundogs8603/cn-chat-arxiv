    "translated_abstract": "利用行为和认知信号预测重度抑郁障碍（MDD）的存在是一个非常棘手的任务。MDD的异质性临床特征意味着任何给定的语音、面部表情和/或观察到的认知模式都可能与抑郁症状的独特组合相关联。传统的判别式机器学习模型可能缺乏稳健地建模这种异质性的复杂性。然而，贝叶斯网络可能更适合这种情况。这些网络是概率图模型，通过明确捕获随机变量的条件依赖性，高效地描述了一组随机变量的联合概率分布。这个框架相比于标准的判别性建模提供了进一步的优势，可以在模型结构中融合专家意见，生成可解释的模型预测，了解预测的不确定性，并自然地处理缺失数据。本文提出了一种基于贝叶斯网络的方法，利用语音和多模态数据预测抑郁症及其相关症状。我们的方法使用一个由有和没有MDD的个体采集的语音和面部表情数据集与传统的判别式机器学习模型进行比较。结果表明，贝叶斯网络方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于传统方法。此外，网络结构提供了不同数据模态相互作用以更准确地预测MDD的见解。",
