    "translated_abstract": "最近，对于时间序列和结构化数据序列的建模取得了进展，这大大推进了异常检测领域的研究。该任务用于识别金融序列、IT系统、航天测量以及医疗领域中的异常行为，其中异常检测可以帮助隔离出抑郁症和老年人的特殊病例。由于非常不确定性的时间相关性，以及异常的定义有时是主观的，所以时间序列中的异常检测是一项复杂的任务。我们在这里提出了一个新的方法，即使用“超几何不确定性”进行异常检测（HypAD）。HypAD通过无监督学习来重建输入信号。我们采用现有技术的最佳实践，通过LSTM建立序列，同时学习解码器来重建信号，并借助GAN评论家的帮助。利用超几何神经网络来进行端到端的不确定性估计。通过使用不确定性，HypAD可以评估是否存在异常。",
