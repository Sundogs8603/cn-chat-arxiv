    "translated_abstract": "鉴于一个法律案例的事实描述文本，法律判决预测（LJP）旨在预测案例的罪名、法律条款和处罚期限。LJP的一个核心问题是如何区分混淆的法律案例，其中只存在微妙的文本差异。以往的研究在使用标准的交叉熵分类损失无法区分不同的分类错误，并忽略了事实描述中的数字，用于预测处罚期限。为了解决这些问题，本文首先提出了一种基于moco的监督对比学习，以学习可区分的表示，并探索构建正例对的最佳策略，从而同时有利于LJP的三个子任务。其次，为了利用法律案例中的数字来预测某些案例的处罚期限，我们进一步增强了由预训练数值模型编码的提取的犯罪金额对事实描述的表示。对公开数据集进行了大量实验。",
