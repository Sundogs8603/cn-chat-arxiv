This hybrid architecture uses dilated causal convolutions for processing large receptive fields in a computationally efficient manner while also leveraging the generalization performance of transformer-based architectures. Our evaluations show as much as 2.2-3.3 dB improvement in SI-SNRi compared to the prior models for this task while having a 1.2-4x smaller model size and a 1.5-2x lower runtime.
