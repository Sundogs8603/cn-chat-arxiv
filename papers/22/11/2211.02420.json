    "abstract": "In a scenario with multiple persons talking simultaneously, the spatial characteristics of the signals are the most distinct feature for extracting the target signal. In this work, we develop a deep joint spatial-spectral non-linear filter that can be steered in an arbitrary target direction. For this we propose a simple and effective conditioning mechanism, which sets the initial state of the filter's recurrent layers based on the target direction. We show that this scheme is more effective than the baseline approach and increases the flexibility of the filter at no performance cost. The resulting spatially selective non-linear filters can also be used for speech separation of an arbitrary number of speakers and enable very accurate multi-speaker localization as we demonstrate in this paper.",

    "translated_abstract": "在多人同时说话的情况下，信号的空间特征是提取目标信号最显著的特征。在本文中，我们开发了一种深度联合空间谱非线性滤波器，可以在任意目标方向上进行导向。为此，我们提出了一种简单而有效的条件机制，该机制基于目标方向设置过滤器递归层的初始状态。我们表明，这种方案比基线方法更有效，并增加了滤波器的灵活性，并且不会降低性能成本。所得到的空间选择性非线性滤波器也可以用于任意数量说话者的语音分离，并且可以实现非常准确的多说话者定位，本文中已经有所展示。",
