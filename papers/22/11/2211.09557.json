    "translated_abstract": "配电网面临由分布式能源资源（DERs）可变功率注入引起的电压快速波动的挑战。为了调节电压，IEEE标准1547建议每个DER根据分段线性的电压/无功控制规则注入无功功率。尽管该标准建议了默认形状，但规则可以按母线自定义。最优规则设计（ORD）的任务具有挑战性，因为电压/无功规则引入非线性动态，并存在稳定性和稳态电压轮廓之间的折衷。 ORD被制定为混合整数非线性规划（MINLP），但在问题规模上并不理想。为了找到更高效的解决方案，我们将ORD重新制定为深度学习问题。其思想是设计一个模拟电压/无功动态的DNN。DNN以电网场景为输入，规则参数为权重，输出平衡电压。通过训练可以找到最佳规则参数。",
