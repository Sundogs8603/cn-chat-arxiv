    "translated_abstract": "从观测数据中估计因果效应是实证科学中的基本任务。当系统中涉及未观察到的混淆因素时，这变得尤为具有挑战性。本文侧重于前门调整——一种经典技术，它使用观察到的中介变量，即使存在未观测到的混淆，也可以识别因果效应。虽然前门估计的统计特性已经很好地理解了，但它的算法方面长期以来一直未得到探究。最近，Jeong，Tian和Barenboim [NeurIPS 2022]提出了一种第一个多项式时间算法，用于在给定的有向无环图（DAG）中找到满足前门准则的集合，其运行时间为$O（n^3（n+m））$，其中$n$表示变量的数量，$m$表示因果图的边的数量。在我们的工作中，我们提供了第一个具有线性时间复杂度的算法，即$O（n+m）$，用于这项任务，从而达到了渐近最优的时间复杂性。",
