    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了如何定义和度量概率预测器的距离校准的根本问题。虽然完美校准的概念是被理解的，但没有共识如何量化距离。文献中提出了许多校准度量，但不清楚它们彼此如何比较，许多流行的度量（如预期校准误差）无法满足连续性等基本属性。我们提出了一个严格的框架来分析校准度量，受到属性测试的文献启发。我们提出了一个距离校准的基础真相：到最接近完美校准预测器的$\\ell_1$距离。我们定义了一种一致性校准度量，即与该距离多项式相关的度量。应用我们的框架，我们确定了三个一致性的校准度量，可以有效地进行估计：平滑校准、区间校准和最大校准。最后，我们通过合成数据集和真实数据集的实证研究表明，这些度量的表现如预期。",
