    "translated_abstract": "研究表明，对于许多具有基础分层结构的数据，将其嵌入双曲空间是有益的。因此，许多机器学习工具被扩展到这些空间，但只有很少对于这些空间中定义的概率分布进行比较的不一致性存在。在双曲空间上，最优输运距离在这样的黎曼流形上是明确定义的，并具有强大的理论性质，但计算成本较高。在欧几里得空间上，切片Wasserstein距离是更具计算效率的方法，它利用一维Wasserstein距离的闭合形式，但在双曲空间上不易获得。在本文中，我们提出了新的双曲切片Wasserstein不一致性构造。这些构造使用基本测地线上的水平面或测地线的投影。我们在不同的任务中研究和比较它们，其中双曲表示是相关的。",
