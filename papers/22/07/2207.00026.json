We propose LaserMix to mix laser beams from different LiDAR scans, and then encourage the model to make consistent and confident predictions before and after mixing.

    "translated_abstract": "密集标注LiDAR点云耗费巨大，限制了完全监督学习方法的可扩展性。本文研究了LiDAR分割中未被充分探索的半监督学习。我们的核心想法是利用LiDAR点云的强空间线索更好地利用未标记数据。我们提出了LaserMix方法，将来自不同LiDAR扫描的激光束混合，然后促使模型在混合前后做出一致且自信的预测。我们的框架具有三个吸引人的特点：1）通用性：LaserMix与LiDAR表示（例如，视角和体素）无关，因此我们的半监督框架可以普遍应用。2）统计基础：我们提供了详细的分析，从理论上解释了所提出框架的适用性。3）有效性：对流行的LiDAR分割数据集（nuScenes，SemanticKITTI和ScribbleKITTI）的全面实验分析证明了我们的有效性和优越性。值得注意的是，我们在SemanticKITTI上取得了显著优势的最优性能。",
