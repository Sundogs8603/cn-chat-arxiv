    "abstract": "This paper develops a trivalent semantics for the truth conditions and the probability of the natural language indicative conditional. Our framework rests on trivalent truth conditions first proposed by W. Cooper and yields two logics of conditional reasoning: (i) a logic C of inference from certain premises; and (ii) a logic U of inference from uncertain premises. But whereas C is monotonic for the conditional, U is not, and whereas C obeys Modus Ponens, U does not without restrictions. We show systematic correspondences between trivalent and probabilistic representations of inferences in either framework, and we use the distinction between the two systems to cast light, in particular, on McGee's puzzle about Modus Ponens. The result is a unified account of the semantics and epistemology of indicative conditionals that can be fruitfully applied to analyzing the validity of conditional inferences.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对自然语言中的指示条件句，提出了三元语义学的真值条件和概率。我们的框架基于W.Cooper最先提出的三元真值条件，提出了两种条件推理逻辑：（i）从确定前提进行推理的逻辑C；（ii）从不确定前提进行推理的逻辑U。然而，C对于条件句是单调的，而U则不是，而且C遵守假言推理规则，U只有在一定限制下才能遵守。我们展示了在这两种框架中进行推理的三元和概率表达之间的系统对应关系，并利用这两个系统的区别，特别是对McGee关于假言推理规则的谜题提出新的解释。结果是一个关于指示条件句的语义和认识论的统一解释，可以有效地应用于分析条件推理的有效性。",
