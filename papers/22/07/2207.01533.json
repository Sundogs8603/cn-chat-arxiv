The CSA2SLS estimator is an alternative to the two-stage least squares estimator that remedies the bias issue caused by many correlated instruments. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations and confirm that the CSA2SLS estimator reduces both the mean squared error and the estimation bias substantially when instruments are correlated.
