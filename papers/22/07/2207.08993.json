Current approximate physics-based methods have errors in the order of kilometers for seven-day predictions, which is insufficient when considering space debris, typically with less than one meter. This failure is usually due to uncertainty around the state of the space object at the beginning of the trajectory, forecasting errors in environmental conditions such as atmospheric drag, and unknown characteristics such as the mass or geometry of the space object.

    "translated_abstract": "自从上世纪50年代发射了第一颗人造卫星以来，轨道上的空间物体数量持续增加。目前估计地球上有一百万个大小超过一厘米的物体正在绕地运行，其中只有三万个大小超过十厘米的物体被跟踪。为了避免碰撞链反应，即基斯勒症候群的发生，必须准确地跟踪和预测碎片和卫星的轨道。当前的近似物理方法对于七天的预测误差在公里级别，这在考虑通常小于一米的空间碎片时是不足够的。这种失败通常是由于在轨道起始点附近的空间物体状态的不确定性，环境条件（如大气阻力）的预测误差以及空间物体的未知特征（如质量或几何形状）所致。操作员可以通过推导未测量物体的特征来提高轨道预测的准确性。",
