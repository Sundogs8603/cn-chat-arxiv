    "translated_abstract": "多尺度架构和注意模块已经证明在许多基于深度学习的图像去雨方法中很有效。然而，手动设计和集成这两个组件到神经网络中需要大量的劳动和广泛的专业知识。在本文中，为图像去雨技术开发了一种高性能的多尺度注意神经体系结构搜索（MANAS）框架。该方法利用多个灵活的模块构建了一个新的多尺度关注搜索空间，这些模块非常适合于图像去雨任务。在该搜索空间下，构建了多尺度注意力单元，进一步用于构建一个强大的图像去雨网络。去雨网络的内部多尺度注意力结构通过基于梯度的搜索算法自动搜索，从某种程度上避免了手动设计的繁琐过程。此外，为了获得鲁棒的图像去雨模型，进一步采用了实用且有效的多尺度训练策略，确保了模型的泛化能力。",
