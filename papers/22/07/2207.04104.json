    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的工作研究了盲点发现方法（“BDM”），这些方法使用图像嵌入来查找数据的语义有意义的子集，在这些子集中图像分类器表现显著更差（即存在盲点）。受到之前工作中观察到的差距的启发，我们介绍了一种新的BDM评估框架（SpotCheck），该框架使用合成图像数据集来训练具有已知盲点的模型，并且使用新的BDM（PlaneSpot）来使用2D图像表示。我们使用SpotCheck进行受控实验，以确定影响BDM性能的因素（例如模型中的盲点数量或定义盲点的特征），并表明PlaneSpot与现有的BDM相竞争，在许多情况下表现更好。重要的是，我们通过设计额外的实验来验证这些发现，使用MS-COCO的真实图像数据集进行实验。我们的发现为未来在BDM设计方面提出了几个有前途的方向。",

Controlled experiments using synthetic image datasets and real image data from MS-COCO validate the performance of BDMs and identify factors that influence their performance. PlaneSpot is shown to be competitive with and, in many cases, outperforms existing BDMs."
