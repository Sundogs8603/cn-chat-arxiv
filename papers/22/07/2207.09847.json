    "abstract": "For human children as well as machine learning systems, a key challenge in learning a word is linking the word to the visual phenomena it describes. We explore this aspect of word learning by using the performance of computer vision systems as a proxy for the difficulty of learning a word from visual cues. We show that the age at which children acquire different categories of words is correlated with the performance of visual classification and captioning systems, over and above the expected effects of word frequency. The performance of the computer vision systems is correlated with human judgments of the concreteness of words, which are in turn a predictor of children's word learning, suggesting that these models are capturing the relationship between words and visual phenomena.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于儿童和机器学习系统来说，学习一个词最关键的挑战是将该词与描述的视觉现象联系起来。我们通过使用计算机视觉系统的表现作为从视觉线索学习一个词的难度的代理来探究词语学习的这个方面。我们发现儿童获得不同类别的词语的年龄与视觉分类和字幕系统的表现相关，超出了词语频率预期效应。计算机视觉系统的表现与词语的具体性的人类判断相关，而具体性又是儿童词语学习的预测因素，这表明这些模型捕捉到了词语与视觉现象之间的关系。",
