Many real-world problems, however, exhibit overly complex dynamics, which makes their full-scale simulation computationally slow. In this paper, we show how to decompose large networked systems of many agents into multiple local components such that we can build separate simulators that run independently and in parallel. To monitor the influence that the different local components exert on one another, each of these simulators is equipped with a learned model that is periodically trained on real trajectories. Our empirical results reveal that distributing the simulation among different processes not only makes it possible to train large multi-agent systems in just a few hours but also helps mitigate the negative effects of simultaneous learning.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于其高样本复杂性，模拟在今天对于成功应用强化学习至关重要。然而，许多现实世界问题表现出过于复杂的动态性，这使得它们的全尺度模拟在计算上变得缓慢。本文展示了如何将许多智能体的大型网络系统分解为多个局部组件，从而我们可以构建独立并并行运行的分开模拟器。为了监测不同局部组件相互施加的影响，这些模拟器每一个都配备了一个周期性训练在真实轨迹上的学习模型。我们的实证结果表明，将模拟分配给不同的进程不仅可以在几小时内训练大型多智能体系统，还有助于减轻同时学习的负面影响。",
