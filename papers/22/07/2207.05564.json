    "translated_abstract": "依赖树已被证明是表示人类语言句子的句法结构的非常成功的模型。在这些结构中，顶点是单词，边连接语法相关的单词。使用随机基线来计算边长度之和或其变体，已经证明了这些依赖关系的倾向是短的。一个普遍存在的基线是在投影排序中的期望和（其中边不相交，并且句子的根词没有被任何边覆盖），可以在$O(n)$时间内计算得到。在这里，我们关注一个较弱的形式约束，即平面性。在理论领域，我们提出了一个刻画平面性的方法，给定一个句子，可以得到平面排列的数量或以均匀随机方式生成平面排列的有效算法。我们还展示了平面排列中的期望总和与投影排列中的期望总和之间的关系。",
