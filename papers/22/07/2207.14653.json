    "translated_abstract": "提出了一种针对海洋或大气流等高维动力系统的集合估计和模拟的方法框架。为此，将该动力系统嵌入由动力驱动的再生核希尔伯特空间族中。这个家族因其吸引人的特性而被命名为仙境。在仙境中，Koopman和Perron-Frobenius算子是酉的和一致连续的。这个属性保证它们可以用对角化有界无穷小生成器的指数级级数表示。此外，可以直接获得对Lyapunov指数和切线线性动态的精确集合式表达式。仙境使我们能够设计出极其简单的集合数据同化方法，用于以轨迹样本的恒定时间线性组合来进行轨迹重构。这种令人尴尬的简单策略得以实现，是通过Hilbert空间设置中切线线性动力的完全合理的叠加原理实现的。",
