    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑保护数据集的全局属性的机密性。这些属性可以编码敏感信息，如商业机密或人口统计数据，而涉及到与文献中通常讨论的个体记录隐私不同的数据保护概念。在这项工作中，我们展示了如何应用分布隐私框架来形式化这种数据机密性。我们将 Pufferfish 隐私的 Wasserstein 机制和属性隐私的高斯机制扩展到这个框架中，然后分析它们的基本数据假设以及如何放宽这些假设。我们接着通过实验证明了这些机制的隐私效用权衡，并将它们应用于针对数据集全局属性的实际属性推断攻击。结果表明，我们的机制确实可以降低攻击的效果，同时提供比粗糙的基于分布隐私机制要高得多的效用。",
