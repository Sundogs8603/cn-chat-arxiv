    "translated_abstract": "随着数据驱动算法（如基于深度学习的方法）的大规模普及，高质量的数据的可用性变得非常重要。在医学领域，体积数据非常重要，涵盖了疾病诊断和治疗监测等方面。当数据集足够时，可以训练模型来帮助医生进行这些任务。然而，有些情况下大量数据是不可用的。例如，罕见疾病和隐私问题可能导致数据受限。在非医学领域，获取足够高质量的数据的高成本也可能是一个问题。解决这些问题的方法可以是使用生成对抗网络（GANs）生成逼真的合成数据。这些机制的存在是一项重要资源，特别是在医疗保健领域，因为数据必须具有良好的质量、逼真，并且没有隐私问题。因此，关于体积数据的大部分出版物侧重于生成高质量逼真数据的方法和技术。",
