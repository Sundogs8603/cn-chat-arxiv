    "translated_abstract": "在合作多智能体强化学习中，分散执行是一项核心需求。目前，大多数流行的MARL算法采用分散策略来实现分散执行，并使用梯度下降作为优化器。然而，在考虑到优化方法的情况下，这些算法几乎没有任何理论分析，我们发现当梯度下降被选为优化方法时，各种流行的分散策略MARL算法在玩具任务中都是次最优的。本文在理论上分析了两种常见的采用分散策略的算法——多智能体策略梯度方法和值分解方法，证明了它们在使用梯度下降时的次最优性。此外，我们提出了转化与蒸馏（TAD）框架，它将多智能体MDP重新制定为一种具有连续结构的特殊单智能体MDP，并通过蒸馏实现分散执行。",
