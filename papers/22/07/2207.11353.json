First, the model does not require tensor data to be complete which expands its application to incomplete data. Second, it utilizes time-to-failure (TTF) to supervise the extraction of low-dimensional features which makes the extracted features more effective for the subsequent prognostic. Besides, an optimization algorithm is proposed for parameter estimation and closed-form solutions are derived under certain distributions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种用于张量数据的监督降维方法，与大多数基于图像的预测模型相比具有两个优势。首先，该模型不要求张量数据完整，从而扩展了其应用范围；其次，利用失效时间（TTF）来监督提取低维特征，使提取的特征更有效地用于后续预测。此外，本文为参数估计提出了一种优化算法，并在特定分布下推导出了闭式解。",

It uses time-to-failure to supervise the extraction of low-dimensional features, leading to more effective prognostics. An optimization algorithm is also introduced for parameter estimation, along with closed-form solutions under certain distributions."
