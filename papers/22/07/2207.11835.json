    "translated_abstract": "最大可提取价值（MEV）指的是矿工（或验证器）从加密货币网络的用户处获得的超额价值。这种超额价值常常来自于重新排列用户交易以最大化手续费，或者插入抢先用户交易的新交易。其中最常见的 MEV 类型之一涉及对恒函数市场生成器（CFMM）上进行交易的用户进行“夹击攻击”，而 CFMM 是一种常见的自动化市场生成器。本文分析了 CFMM 中 MEV 的博弈论特性，其中包括我们所称的“路由”和“排序” MEV。在路由的情况下，我们提出了存在 MEV 会降低，并且令人意外的，会“改善”路由质量的案例。我们构建了一个类似于这种情况下的无序坍塌价格，并证明如果夹击攻击的影响在适当的意义下是局部化的，则纳什均衡价格将是常数。在排序的情况下，我们展示了当最大价值被提取时的条件",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper analyzes the game theoretic properties of maximal extractable value (MEV) in cryptocurrency networks, focusing on the constant function market maker (CFMM). The authors identify two types of MEV - \"routing\" and \"reordering\" - and present examples where MEV can both degrade and improve routing quality. They also construct an analogue of the price of anarchy and prove that the Nash equilibrium price will be constant if the impact of a sandwich attack is localized in a suitable sense."
