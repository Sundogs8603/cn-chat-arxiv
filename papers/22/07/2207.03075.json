    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）是一个活跃的研究领域。医学领域是采用FL的最适合领域之一，因为必须尊重患者隐私。然而，以往的研究并没有提供在医学领域中应用FL的实用指南。本文针对三个代表性的医学数据集，即长期的电子健康记录、皮肤癌图像和心电图信号，提出经验基准和实验设置。潜在的FL用户，如医疗机构和IT公司，可以将这些基准作为采用FL的指南，并尽可能减少试错。对于每个数据集，每个客户端数据来自不同的来源，以保留现实世界的异质性。我们评估了六种针对客户端数据异质性问题的FL算法，以及一种将两种典型FL算法的优点结合起来的混合算法。基于三种类型数据的实验结果，我们发现简单的FL算法可以达到与更复杂算法相当的性能。我们的工作为医疗机构和IT公司提供了在安全高效的方式下，应用FL从而改善医疗保健的实用指南。",
