    "translated_abstract": "本文研究随机多臂赌博机在固定置信度场景下的最佳臂辨识问题。考虑到广义指数族赌博机的类别。现有的指数族赌博机算法面临计算挑战。为了缓解这些挑战，最佳臂辨识问题被视为序贯复合假设检验任务进行分析，并提出了一种框架，采用基于似然比的测试，这种测试已经证明对于序列测试是有效的。基于这个检验统计量，设计了一种BAI算法，该算法利用了经典的序贯概率比测试进行臂的选择，并且易于分析指数族赌博机。该算法具有两个关键特点：（1）它的样本复杂度是渐近最优的，（2）它保证是$\\delta-$PAC的。现有的有效方法集中在高斯条件下，并要求对被认为是最佳臂的臂使用Thompson采样。",
