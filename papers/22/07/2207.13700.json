    "translated_abstract": "神经系统疾病的药物治疗通常是远程进行的，远离医院的环境对及时准确地收集健康状态数据构成了挑战。穿戴式传感器收集的行为信号的个体差异也导致采用当前的通用机器学习分析流程存在困难。为了应对这些挑战，本研究提出一种使用公共 mPower 数据集的方法，该数据集包含来自 487 名患者的智能手机收集的62,182个远程多模式测试记录，用于预测帕金森病患者的用药状态。提出的方法通过考察病人个体的历史记录，并通过 Transformer 模型学习注意权重，有望在客观上预测三种不同的用药状态：用药前（AUC = 0.95）、用药后（AUC = 0.958）和其他时刻（AUC = 0.976）。本方法为个性化远程健康传感提供了一种创新方法。",
