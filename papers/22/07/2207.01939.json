    "abstract": "We develop a cross-border market model between two countries in which the transmission capacities that enable transactions between market participants of different countries are limited. Starting from two reduced-form representations of national limit order book dynamics, we allow incoming market orders to be matched with standing volumes of the foreign market, resulting in cross-border trades. Since the transmission capacities in our model are limited, our model alternates between regimes in which cross-border trades are possible and regimes in which incoming market orders can only be matched against limit orders of the same origin. We derive a high-frequency approximation of our microscopic model, assuming that the size of an individual order converges to zero while the order arrival rate tends to infinity. If transmission capacities are available, the limit process behaves as follows: the volume dynamics is a four-dimensional linear Brownian motion in the positive orthant with obliq",

    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一个跨越两个国家的市场模型，在该模型中，连接不同国家的市场参与者的传输容量是有限的。从两个国家限价委托簿动态的简化形式出发，我们允许来自外国市场的委托与固定的法国市场数量相匹配，从而产生跨境交易。由于我们模型中的传输容量是有限的，所以我们的模型在具有跨境交易可能性和仅能将来自同一地方的市场订单匹配的模式之间交替切换。我们导出了我们微观模型的高频近似，假设单个订单的大小趋于零，订单到达率趋于无穷大。如果有传输容量，极限过程行为如下：正半轴内的四维线性布朗运动中的体积动态。",
