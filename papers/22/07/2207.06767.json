    "abstract": "Performance in Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) on a single language has increased greatly in the last few years thanks to the use of deep learning techniques. However, cross-lingual SER remains a challenge in real-world applications due to two main factors: the first is the big gap among the source and the target domain distributions; the second factor is the major availability of unlabeled utterances in contrast to the labeled ones for the new language. Taking into account previous aspects, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) method for cross-lingual emotion recognition when only few labeled examples in the target domain (i.e. the new language) are available. Our method is based on a Transformer and it adapts to the new domain by exploiting a pseudo-labeling strategy on the unlabeled utterances. In particular, the use of a hard and soft pseudo-labels approach is investigated. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of the proposed method in a speaker-independent setup on both ",

    "translated_abstract": "过去几年来，由于深度学习技术的使用，单语种语音情绪识别（SER）的性能大幅提升。然而，由于源语种和目标语种之间存在较大差异以及目标语种中缺乏标注数据，跨语言SER在实际应用中仍然是一个挑战。考虑到这些因素，本文提出了一种半监督学习方法，用于当目标语种（即新语言）中只有少量标注样本可用时的跨语言情绪识别。我们的方法基于Transformer，并通过在未标注的语句上利用伪标签策略来适应新领域。具体而言，我们研究了硬伪标签和软伪标签两种方法。我们对提出的方法在独立说话人的设定下进行了全面评估，同时涵盖了两个目标语种。",
