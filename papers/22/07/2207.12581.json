    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种连续时间控制方法，用于证明权益（Proof-of-Stake，PoS）区块链中的最优交易，将其构建为一个消费与投资的问题，目的是在参与者(或代理人)持有/交易股份与消费需求的效用之间取得最佳平衡。我们通过动态规划和Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman(HJB)方程的解决方案，对此进行了阐述。当效用函数为线性或凸函数时，我们得出了闭合形式的解，并表明bang-bang策略是最优的（即总是以全部容量购买或出售）。此外，我们还揭示了交易/持有股份的回报率与参与者的风险调整估价之间的显式联系。特别地，我们展示了当参与者是风险中性或风险寻求型时，相应的风险调整估值为鞅或次鞅，最优策略必须是始终购买、始终出售或先买后卖，两者都是。",
