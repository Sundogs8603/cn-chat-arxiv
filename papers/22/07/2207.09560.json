    "translated_abstract": "设计具有良好样本外性能的机器学习和决策的数据驱动公式是一个关键的挑战。好的样本内性能不一定能保证好的样本外性能，这被普遍认为是过拟合问题。实际的过拟合通常不能归因于单一原因，而是由多个因素同时引起的。我们在这里考虑了三个过拟合的源头：（一）统计误差，由于使用有限的样本数据而产生的误差，（二）数据噪声，当数据点只用有限精度测量时产生的噪声，（三）数据错误，即全部数据中有一小部分数据被完全破坏。我们认为，尽管现有的数据驱动公式在单独处理这三个源头时可能是稳健的，但它们不能同时提供对所有过拟合源头的全面保护。我们设计了一种新颖的数据驱动公式，可以保证这种全面保护。",
