    "translated_abstract": "作为第三代神经网络，脉冲神经网络（SNN）致力于探索更深入的神经机制，以实现接近生物智能的效果。生物模拟机制对于理解和改进SNN至关重要。例如，关联长时程增强（ALTP）现象表明，除了神经元之间的学习机制外，神经元内部也存在关联效应。然而，大多数现有方法仅关注前者，缺乏对内部关联效应的探索。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的自适应内部关联（AIA）神经元模型，以建立先前忽视的神经元内部影响。与ALTP现象一致，AIA神经元模型对输入刺激具有自适应性，只有在同时激发两个树突时才会发生内部联想学习。此外，我们采用加权的权重来测量内部关联，并引入中间缓存来减少突触资源。我们证明，所提出的AIA神经元模型可以促进更强的联想学习，从而提高网络在各种任务上的性能，相较于现有的SNN模型。",
