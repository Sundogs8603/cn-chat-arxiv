    "abstract": "This paper provides a novel theory of research joint ventures for financially constrained firms. When firms choose R&D portfolios, an RJV can help to coordinate research efforts, reducing investments in duplicate projects. This can free up resources, increase the variety of pursued projects and thereby increase the probability of discovering the innovation. RJVs improve innovation outcomes when market competition is weak and external financing conditions are bad. An RJV may increase the innovation probability and nevertheless lower total R&D costs. RJVs that increase innovation also increase consumer surplus and tend to be profitable, but innovation-reducing RJVs also exist. Finally, we compare RJVs to innovation-enhancing mergers.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提供了一个关于受金融约束的企业进行研究联合企业的新理论。当企业选择研发组合时，联合企业可以帮助协调研究努力，减少对重复项目的投资。这可以释放资源，增加追求的项目的多样性，从而增加创新的可能性。当市场竞争弱和外部融资条件不佳时，联合企业改善了创新结果。联合企业可能增加创新的概率，同时降低总研发成本。增加创新的联合企业也增加了消费者剩余，并且倾向于盈利，但也存在削减创新的联合企业。最后，我们将联合企业与增强创新的合并进行了比较。",
