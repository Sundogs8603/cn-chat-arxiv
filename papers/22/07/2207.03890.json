    "translated_abstract": "NetFlow数据是许多网络分析师和研究人员使用的流行网络日志格式。与深度包检查相比，使用NetFlow的优势在于更易于收集和处理，对隐私性的侵入性更小。许多研究使用机器学习来使用NetFlow数据检测网络攻击。这些机器学习流水线的第一步是在将数据提供给机器学习算法之前对数据进行预处理。存在许多方法来预处理NetFlow数据；然而，这些方法只是简单地将现有方法应用于数据，而不考虑网络数据的特定属性。我们认为，对于源自软件系统（如NetFlow或软件日志）的数据，特征值的频率和上下文的相似性比值本身的相似性更重要。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种编码算法，在处理数据时直接考虑特征值的频率和上下文。",
