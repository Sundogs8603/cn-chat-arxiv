This paper develops a unified embedding model for signed networks to disentangle the intertwined balance structure and anomaly effect, which can greatly facilitate the downstream analysis, including community detection, anomaly detection, and network inference. The proposed model captures both balance structure and anomaly effect through a low rank plus sparse matrix decomposition, which are jointly estimated via a regularized formulation. Its theoretical guarantees are established in terms of asymptotic consistency and finite-sample probability bounds for network embedding, community detection and anomaly detection. The advantage of the proposed embedding model is also demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic networks and an international relation network.",

    "translated_abstract": "在现实生活中，我们经常观察到带有附加符号信息的网络，然而这些信息在现有的网络模型中被大部分忽视了。本文针对签名网络开发了一个统一的嵌入模型，以解开错综复杂的平衡结构和异常效应，从而可以极大地促进下游分析，包括社区检测、异常检测和网络推断。所提出的模型通过低秩加稀疏矩阵分解捕捉平衡结构和异常效应，并通过正则化方法联合估计二者。在网络嵌入、社区检测和异常检测方面，它的理论保证是建立在渐近一致性和有限样本概率边界的基础上。所提出的嵌入模型的优势还通过对合成网络和国际关系网络进行广泛的数值实验得到了证明。",
