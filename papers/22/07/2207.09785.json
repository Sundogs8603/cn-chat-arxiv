This method aims to classify power consumption as active or passive, granting the ability to report on the residents' activity and presence without direct interaction. This lays the foundation for applications like non-intrusive health monitoring of private homes.  The proposed method is based on minimizing a suitable energy functional, for which the iPALM (inertial proximal alternating linearized minimization) algorithm is employed, demonstrating that various conditions guaranteeing convergence are satisfied.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种针对私人住宅中配备智能电表的无监督能量分解方法。该方法旨在将功耗分类为有功或者无功，从而能够报告居民的活动和存在情况，而无需直接交互。这为非侵入式私人住宅的健康监测等应用奠定了基础。所提出的方法基于最小化适当的能量泛函，采用了iPALM（惯性近端交替线性化最小化）算法，证明了满足收敛的各种条件。为了确认所提出方法的可行性，对半合成测试数据集进行了实验，并与现有的监督方法进行了比较。",
