    "translated_abstract": "人类利用组合性从过去的经验中推广到新颖的经验。我们假设我们的经验可以分解为基本的原子组件，这些组件可以以新颖的方式重新组合，以支持我们参与新颖经验的能力。我们将这视为学习以组合方式泛化的能力，并将利用这种能力的行为称为组合学习行为（CLBs）。学习CLBs的一个核心问题是解决绑定问题（BP）。尽管这是人类轻松完成的智能壮举，但对于现有技术的人工智能代理来说并非如此。因此，为了构建能够与人类合作的人工智能代理，我们建议开发一个新的基准来研究代理商通过解决BP的领域无关版本来展示CLBs的能力。我们受到指代游戏的语言涌现和基础架构框架的启发，提出了一个元学习扩展方案",
