    "abstract": "The use of Deep Learning and Computer Vision in the Cultural Heritage domain is becoming highly relevant in the last few years with lots of applications about audio smart guides, interactive museums and augmented reality. All these technologies require lots of data to work effectively and be useful for the user. In the context of artworks, such data is annotated by experts in an expensive and time consuming process. In particular, for each artwork, an image of the artwork and a description sheet have to be collected in order to perform common tasks like Visual Question Answering. In this paper we propose a method for Visual Question Answering that allows to generate at runtime a description sheet that can be used for answering both visual and contextual questions about the artwork, avoiding completely the image and the annotation process. For this purpose, we investigate on the use of GPT-3 for generating descriptions for artworks analyzing the quality of generated descriptions through",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习和计算机视觉在文化遗产领域中的应用在过去几年中变得越来越重要，有大量音频智能导游、互动博物馆和增强现实的应用。所有这些技术都需要大量的数据才能有效地工作并对用户有用。在艺术品的背景下，这些数据是由专家进行注释的，这是一个昂贵和耗时的过程。特别是，对于每件艺术品，都必须收集一幅艺术品的图像和一个描述表以执行常见任务，例如视觉问答。在本文中，我们提出了一种视觉问答的方法，该方法允许在运行时生成一个描述表，可用于回答有关艺术品的视觉和上下文问题，完全避免了图像和注释过程。为此，我们探索了使用GPT-3为艺术品生成描述的方法，并分析了生成的描述质量。",
