    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的轨迹比较算法，用于识别异常生命体征趋势，旨在改善对健康恶化的识别。近来人们对于用于在家远程监测患者的连续佩戴式生命体征传感器越来越感兴趣。这些监测器通常与警报系统配对使用，当生命体征测量值超出预定正常范围时触发警报。生命体征趋势，如心率增加，通常是健康状况恶化的征兆，但是很少被纳入警报系统。我们引入了基于动态时间扭曲距离的度量，用于比较时间序列轨迹。我们将每个多变量生命体征时间序列分为180分钟，不重叠的时段。然后计算所有时段之间的距离。每个时段的特征为其与所有其他时段之间的平均距离（平均链接距离），通过相邻时段形成聚类。我们通过合成生成的数据集和来自COVID-19患者的真实数据表明，我们的方法在检测异常轨迹方面优于标准方法。我们提出的轨迹比较算法可以潜在地整合到现有的警报系统中，以提高识别COVID-19患者健康恶化的精度和时效性。",
