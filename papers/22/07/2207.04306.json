    "translated_abstract": "在实际应用中安全部署时间序列分类器依赖于能够检测不是由训练数据生成的数据，这个任务被称为离群检测(out-of-distribution, OOD)。本文考虑了时间序列领域中ODO检测的新问题。我们讨论了时间序列数据所带来的独特挑战，并解释了为什么来自图像领域的先前方法效果不佳。受到这些挑战的启发，本文提出了一种新颖的季节比例评分(SRS)方法。SRS包括三个关键算法步骤。首先，将每个输入分解为按类别的语义组件和余项。然后，利用这个分解使用深度生成模型来估计输入和余项的按类别的条件概率。从这些估计值计算季节比例评分。最后，从正常分布数据中识别出阈值区间来检测离群样本。实验",
