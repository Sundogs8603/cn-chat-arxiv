    "translated_abstract": "免疫反应是一个动态过程，通过该过程，机体确定抗原是自身还是非自身。这个动态过程的状态由组成决策过程的炎症和调节作用因子的相对平衡和种群定义。免疫疗法应用于类风湿性关节炎等，其目标是将免疫状态偏向调节作用因子，从而关闭自身免疫反应中的自身免疫通路。虽然已知有几种免疫疗法方法，但该疗法的有效性取决于该干预如何改变该状态的演变。不幸的是，这个过程不仅由过程的动态性确定，还由干预时系统的状态确定，而干预前很难甚至不可能确定系统的状态。为了确定这种状态，我们考虑了一个类风湿性关节炎小鼠模型（胶原诱导性关节炎），进行了免疫疗法；收集了高量级。。。",
