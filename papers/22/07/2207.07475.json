    "translated_abstract": "近年来，权重绑定模型在神经网络的现代发展中受到了关注。深度平衡模型(DEQ)通过权重绑定表示无穷深度的神经网络，最近的研究表明了这种方法的潜力。DEQs需要迭代地解决训练中的根查找问题，并基于一种假设构建，即通过模型确定的基础动态会收敛到一个固定点。在本文中，我们提出了稳定不变模型(SIM)，一种新的深度模型类，它在原则上在稳定性下近似于DEQ，并将动态扩展到更一般的收敛到一个不变集合(不限于一个固定点)的情况下。推导SIM的关键要素是通过Koopman和Perron-Frobenius算子的频谱表示动态。这个视角大致揭示了DEQ的稳定动态，然后推导出SIM的两个变体。我们还提出了一种可以学习SIM的实现方法。",
