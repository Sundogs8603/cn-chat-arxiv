    "translated_abstract": "除了最大化总收益外，很多行业的决策者还希望确保不同资源之间消耗的平衡。例如，在零售行业中，确保来自不同供应商的资源平衡消耗有助于提高公平性并维持良好的渠道关系；在云计算行业中，资源消耗的平衡有助于提高客户满意度并降低运营成本。针对这些实际需求，本文研究了基于价格的网络收益管理问题，同时考虑了需求学习和公平资源消耗平衡。我们引入了规范化收益的概念，即通过平衡正则化将公平的资源消耗平衡纳入到收益最大化的目标中。我们提出了一种基于上置信界限（UCB）需求学习方法的原始对偶在线策略来最大化规范化收益。我们采用了几个创新方法来应对需求学习和资源消耗平衡的挑战。",
