    "abstract": "In this paper we will provide a quantitative analysis of a simple model of the Federal Disaster Assistance policy from the viewpoint of three different stakeholders. This quantitative methodology is new and has applications to other areas such as business and healthcare processes. The stakeholders are interested in process transparency but each has a different opinion on precisely what constitutes transparency. We will also consider three modifications to the Federal Disaster Assistance policy and analyse, from a stakeholder viewpoint, how stakeholder satisfaction changes from process to process. This analysis is used to rank the favourability of four policies with respect to all collective stakeholder preferences.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文从三个不同利益相关者的角度，对联邦灾难援助政策的一个简单模型进行了数量分析。这种数量分析方法是新的，在其他领域如业务和医疗流程中也有应用。利益相关者对过程透明度很感兴趣，但每个人对透明度的具体定义都有不同的看法。我们还考虑了三种联邦灾难援助政策的修改，并分析了从利益相关者的角度看，每种政策下利益相关者满意度的变化情况。这种分析被用来对四种政策的偏好进行排序，以便考虑到所有集体利益相关者的偏好。",
