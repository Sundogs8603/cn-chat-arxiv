    "abstract": "Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) plays a significant part in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems since it can provide empathetic services. Multimodal ERC can mitigate the drawbacks of uni-modal approaches. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used in a variety of fields due to their superior performance in relation modeling. In multimodal ERC, GNNs are capable of extracting both long-distance contextual information and inter-modal interactive information. Unfortunately, since existing methods such as MMGCN directly fuse multiple modalities, redundant information may be generated and diverse information may be lost. In this work, we present a directed Graph based Cross-modal Feature Complementation (GraphCFC) module that can efficiently model contextual and interactive information. GraphCFC alleviates the problem of heterogeneity gap in multimodal fusion by utilizing multiple subspace extractors and Pair-wise Cross-modal Complementary (PairCC) strategy. ",

    "translated_abstract": "对话情感识别在人机交互系统中起着重要作用，因为它可以提供有共情心理的服务。多模态对话情感识别可以缓解单模态方法的缺点。最近，由于关系建模方面的卓越性能，图神经网络已被广泛用于各种领域。在多模态对话情感识别中，图神经网络能够提取远距离的上下文信息和跨模态的交互信息。不幸的是，由于现有方法（如MMGCN）直接融合多个模态，可能会产生冗余信息，且可能丢失多样化的信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于有向图的跨模态特征补充（GraphCFC）模块，可以有效地模拟上下文和互动信息。GraphCFC通过利用多个子空间提取器和成对跨模态补充（PairCC）策略，缓解了多模态融合中的异构性差距问题。",
