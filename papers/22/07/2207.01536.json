The social planner can invest in a buffer fund in order to guarantee a minimal pension amount. The model aims at taking into account complex dynamic phenomena such as the demographic risk and its evolution over time, the time and age dependence of agents preferences, and financial risks. The preference criterion of the social planner is modeled by a consistent dynamic utility defined on a stochastic domain, which incorporates the heterogeneity of overlapping generations and its evolution over time.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出并研究了一种针对即期支付养老金计划的最优投资/养老金政策。社会规划者可以投资一个缓冲基金，以保证最低养老金金额。该模型旨在考虑复杂的动态现象，如人口风险及其随时间的演变、代理人偏好的时间和年龄依赖性以及金融风险。社会规划者的偏好准则采用在随机域上定义的一致动态效用函数来建模，该函数包括重叠代际的异质性及其随时间的演变。偏好准则和优化问题还融入了可持续性、充足性和公平性的约束。本文设计并解决了社会规划者的动态决策准则，并计算了在一个一般框架下的最优投资/养老金政策。此外，还对动态功用函数的情况进行了详细分析。",
