    "translated_abstract": "流通是一个成功货币体系的特征，不论是社区货币、数字货币还是国家货币。本文提出一种适合分析数字交易记录来研究货币流通的网络分析方法。Sarafu是一种数字社区货币，曾在肯尼亚流通，期间因COVID-19疫情导致经济剧烈动荡。我们把Sarafu的流通表示为4万名用户之间货币流动的网络。网络流量分析显示Sarafu的流通高度模块化，地理局限性强，参与流通的人来自不同的职业群体。在本地化的子群中，网络循环分析支持流通需要循环的直觉。此外，支持流通的子网络始终具有度的反匹配性，我们还发现了证据表明用户往往会偏向选择性的互相交易。基于社区的机构通常扮演着当地枢纽的角色。",
