    "abstract": "A major goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to create an agent capable of acquiring a general understanding of the world. Such an agent would require the ability to continually accumulate and build upon its knowledge as it encounters new experiences. Lifelong or continual learning addresses this setting, whereby an agent faces a continual stream of problems and must strive to capture the knowledge necessary for solving each new task it encounters. If the agent is capable of accumulating knowledge in some form of compositional representation, it could then selectively reuse and combine relevant pieces of knowledge to construct novel solutions. Despite the intuitive appeal of this simple idea, the literatures on lifelong learning and compositional learning have proceeded largely separately. In an effort to promote developments that bridge between the two fields, this article surveys their respective research landscapes and discusses existing and future connections between them.",

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能的主要目标之一是创建一个能够获得对世界的普遍理解的代理。这种代理需要能够不断积累和建立知识，以应对遇到的新体验。终身或连续学习解决了这种情况，在这种情况下，代理面对不断的问题流，必须努力掌握解决每个新任务所需的知识。如果代理能够在某种组合表示形式中累积知识，则可以选择性地重用和组合相关的知识，构建新的解决方案。尽管这个简单的想法具有直观的吸引力，但是有关终身学习和组合学习的文献在很大程度上是分开进行的。为了促进两个领域之间的连接，本文概述了它们各自的研究景观，并讨论了它们之间现有和未来的联系。",
