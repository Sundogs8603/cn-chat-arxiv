    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的自回归模型，用于统计分析多元分布时间序列。感兴趣的数据包括一组在实线有界间隔上支持的概率测度的多个系列，并且被不同时间瞬间所索引。概率测度被建模为Wasserstein空间中的随机对象。我们通过在Lebesgue测度的切空间中建立自回归模型，首先对所有原始测度进行居中处理，以便它们的Fréchet平均值成为Lebesgue测度。利用迭代随机函数系统的理论，提供了这样一个模型的解的存在性、唯一性和平稳性的结果。我们还提出了模型系数的一致估计器。除了对模拟数据的分析，我们还使用两个实际数据集进行了模型演示：一个是不同国家年龄分布的观察数据集，另一个是巴黎自行车共享网络的观察数据集。",
