    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新颖的模型无关算法，名为自适应集成批量多输入多输出鲍型分位数回归（AEnbMIMOCQR），使得预测者能够以分布无关的方式生成固定预设失配率的多步鲍型预测区间。我们的方法基于鲍型预测原理，但不需要数据拆分，并且即使在数据不可互换的情况下也能提供接近精确的覆盖率。此外，所得到的预测区间在预测时间范围内经验证明有效，并且考虑了异方差性。AEnbMIMOCQR被设计成对分布转变具有鲁棒性，这意味着其预测区间在无限的时间范围内保持可靠，而无需重新训练或对数据生成过程进行不切实际的严格假设。通过系统实验，我们证明了我们的方法在鲍型预测中优于其他竞争方法。",
