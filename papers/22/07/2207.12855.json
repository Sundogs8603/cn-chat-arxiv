    "translated_abstract": "机器学习方法越来越被用于构建计算上廉价的复杂物理模型的替代模型。当数据不稳定、稀疏或时间相关时，这些替代模型的预测能力会下降。为了找到一种可以提供任何潜在未来模型评估的有效预测的替代模型，我们介绍了一种由优化器驱动的在线学习方法。该方法有两个优点，首先它确保在训练数据中包含模型响应曲面上的所有拐点。其次，在任何新的模型评估之后，如果“得分”下降到下限，则会进行机器学习模型的“重新训练”（更新）。在基准函数上的测试表明，与传统的采样方法相比，由优化器引导的采样通常在局部极值附近的准确性方面表现优越，即使评分指标支持整体准确性。我们将该方法应用于核物质的模拟中，以证明它处理嘈杂、稀疏和时间相关的数据的能力。我们建立的替代模型比同样数量的训练数据构建的目前使用的替代模型更准确。我们的在线方法提供了一种计算上高效的替代模型，而传统的替代模型则需要大量的训练数据。",
