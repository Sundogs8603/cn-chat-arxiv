    "abstract": "Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is essential for creating trustworthy machine learning models. Recent years have seen a steep rise in UQ methods that can flag suspicious examples, however, it is often unclear what exactly these methods identify. In this work, we propose a framework for categorizing uncertain examples flagged by UQ methods in classification tasks. We introduce the confusion density matrix -- a kernel-based approximation of the misclassification density -- and use this to categorize suspicious examples identified by a given uncertainty method into three classes: out-of-distribution (OOD) examples, boundary (Bnd) examples, and examples in regions of high in-distribution misclassification (IDM). Through extensive experiments, we show that our framework provides a new and distinct perspective for assessing differences between uncertainty quantification methods, thereby forming a valuable assessment benchmark.",

    "translated_abstract": "不确定性量化（UQ）对于创建可信赖的机器学习模型至关重要。近年来，出现了许多能够标记可疑样本的UQ方法，然而，这些方法究竟识别了什么内容往往不清楚。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个框架，用于对分类任务中被UQ方法标记为不确定的示例进行分类。我们引入了混淆密度矩阵——基于核的误分类密度的近似，并将其用于将被给定不确定性方法识别为可疑样本的示例分为三类：分布外（OOD）样本、边界（Bnd）样本和处于高分布误分类区域（IDM）的示例。通过大量实验，我们证明了我们的框架为评估不同不确定性量化方法之间的差异提供了一种新的独特视角，从而形成了一个有价值的评估基准。",
