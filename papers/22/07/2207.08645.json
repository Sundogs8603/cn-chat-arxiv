    "translated_abstract": "逆强化学习（IRL）是从专家演示中推断奖励函数的强大范式。许多IRL算法需要已知的转移模型，有时甚至需要已知的专家策略，或者至少需要访问生成模型。但是，这些假设对于许多实际应用来说太强了，因为只能通过顺序交互来访问环境。我们提出了一种新的IRL算法：主动探索逆强化学习（AceIRL），它主动探索未知环境和专家策略，快速学习专家的奖励函数并识别出一个好的策略。AceIRL使用先前的观察结果构建置信区间来捕捉可行的奖励函数，并找到侧重于环境中最有信息的区域的探索策略。AceIRL是第一种具有样本复杂度界限且不需要环境生成模型的主动IRL方法。",
