    "translated_abstract": "本文针对高维空间中从含噪声的矩信息中学习$k$-尖峰混合的稀疏矩问题进行了研究。我们使用运输距离来衡量学习混合模型的准确性。先前的算法要么假设了特定的分离条件，要么使用更多的恢复矩，要么运行在（超）指数时间。我们针对一维问题提出了一个鲁棒的算法（也称为稀疏Hausdorff矩问题），其基础是经典的Prony方法，我们的贡献主要在于分析。我们采用了比先前工作更全面且更紧密的分析（先前工作分析了Prony方法中间结果的摄动）。一个有用的技术要素是Vandermonde矩阵定义的线性系统与Schur多项式之间的联系，它使得我们能够提供与分离无关的紧密摄动界限，并且在其他情境中也可能有用。为了解决高维问题，我们首先求解了一维问题的情况。",
