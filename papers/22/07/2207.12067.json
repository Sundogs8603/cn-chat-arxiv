    "translated_abstract": "如何让机器学习系统学习到准确表示其与真实世界交互的内在模型是一个尚待解决的问题。为了构建不仅包含观察性知识，也包含干预性知识的表现学习框架，我们使用了表示学习和群论的方法来研究该问题。我们提出一种方法，使机器能够在行动过程中学习到与之相一致的感知信息的内部表示，而这些行动实际上是变换这些信息的。我们使用一个自编码器并在其潜在空间上应用群组表示，通过利用等变损失强制实施适当的同态性质以完成训练。与现有方法不同的是，我们的方法不需要先验群组知识，并且不限制代理可执行的行动集合。理论上，我们证明了该方法的有效性，并通过实验证明了其能够学习到行动的群组表示，从而捕获了环境中的转换结构。",
