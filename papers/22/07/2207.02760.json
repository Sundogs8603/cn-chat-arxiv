    "abstract": "When dealing with tabular data, models based on decision trees are a popular choice due to their high accuracy on these data types, their ease of application, and explainability properties. However, when it comes to graph-structured data, it is not clear how to apply them effectively, in a way that incorporates the topological information with the tabular data available on the vertices of the graph. To address this challenge, we introduce TREE-G. TREE-G modifies standard decision trees, by introducing a novel split function that is specialized for graph data. Not only does this split function incorporate the node features and the topological information, but it also uses a novel pointer mechanism that allows split nodes to use information computed in previous splits. Therefore, the split function adapts to the predictive task and the graph at hand. We analyze the theoretical properties of TREE-G and demonstrate its benefits empirically on multiple graph and vertex prediction benchmarks",

    "translated_abstract": "在处理表格数据时，基于决策树的模型是一个流行的选择，因为它们在这些数据类型上具有高准确性、易于应用和可解释性的特点。然而，在处理图结构化数据时，如何有效地应用决策树并将拓扑信息与图的顶点上的表格数据相结合仍不清楚。为了解决这个挑战，我们引入了TREE-G。TREE-G修改了标准决策树，引入了一种专门针对图数据的新型分裂函数。这个分裂函数不仅包括节点特征和拓扑信息，还使用了一种新颖的指针机制，允许分裂节点使用在先前分裂中计算得到的信息。因此，分裂函数能够适应预测任务和当前的图。我们对TREE-G的理论性质进行了分析，并在多个图和顶点预测基准测试上从经验上证明了它的好处。",
