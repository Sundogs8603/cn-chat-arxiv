    "translated_abstract": "使用非语言沟通作为社会和心理现象测量的证据，自动化的共同人际互动分析得到了解决。我们对从2010年以来的计算研究进行了调查，检测与社交特征（如领导力、支配力、个性特征）、社交角色/关系和互动动态（如团队凝聚力、参与度、融洽度）相关的现象。我们的目标是确定导致有效性能的非语言线索和计算方法。这项调查在涉及最广泛的社会现象和互动场景（自由对话、会议、二元组和人群）方面与其同类不同。我们还提供了相关数据集的综合总结，并概述了关于人工智能实施、数据集策划和保护隐私的互动分析的未来研究方向。一些重要观察结果是：最常用的非语言线索是共同 ...",
