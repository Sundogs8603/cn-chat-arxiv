    "translated_abstract": "符号回归是一种机器学习技术，它可以学习数据的控制公式，从而有可能改变科学发现。然而，符号回归在分析复杂度和维度方面仍然存在局限性。另一方面，深度学习已经通过其分析极其复杂和高维数据集的能力改变了机器学习。我们提出了一种神经网络体系结构，将符号回归扩展到参数系统，其中一些系数可能会变化，但潜在的控制方程的结构保持不变。我们在各种解析表达式，ODE 和 PDE 上展示了我们的方法，其中系数变化不同，并展示了它在训练域之外的外推能力。基于神经网络的体系结构还可以与其他深度学习体系结构集成，从而能够在进行端对端训练的同时分析高维数据。为此，我们将我们的体系结构与深度卷积神经网络集成，以分析来自流体动力学模拟的一组图像，并发现相应的控制方程。",
