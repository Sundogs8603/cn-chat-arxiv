    "abstract": "Natural language generation (NLG) is a process within artificial intelligence where computer systems produce human-comprehensible language texts from information. English as a foreign language (EFL) students' use of NLG tools might facilitate their idea generation, which is fundamental to creative writing.

This study explores strategies adopted by EFL students when searching for ideas using NLG tools, evaluating ideas generated by NLG tools and selecting NLG tools for ideas generation. Four Hong Kong secondary school students attended workshops where they learned to write stories comprising their own words and words generated by NLG tools. After the workshops, they answered questions to reflect on their writing experience with NLG tools. In a thematic analysis of the written reflections, we found students may have existing ideas when searching for ideas and evaluating ideas with NLG tools. Studen",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言生成（NLG）是人工智能中的一个过程，其中计算机系统从信息中生成人类可理解的语言文本。 EFL学生使用NLG工具可能有助于他们的创意生成，这对于创意写作是基础。 然而，我们对EFL学生如何与NLG工具交互生成思路知之甚少。 本研究探讨了EFL学生使用NLG工具搜索思路、评估NLG工具生成的思路以及选择NLG工具进行思路生成时采用的策略。 四名香港中学生参加了研讨会，他们学习编写包括自己的话语和NLG工具生成的单词的故事。 研讨会结束后，他们回答问题以反思使用NLG工具的写作经验。 在书面反思的主题分析中，我们发现学生在使用NLG工具搜索和评估思路时可能已经有现有的想法。",
