This method allows the recovery of the full neutrino momentum which is usually left as a free parameter and permits one to sample neutrino values under a learned conditional likelihood given event observations. We demonstrate the success of $\\nu$-Flows in a case study by applying it to simulated semileptonic $t\\bar{t}$ events and show that it can lead to more accurate momentum reconstruction, particularly of the longitudinal coordinate. We also show that this has direct benefits in a downstream task of jet association, leading to an improvement of up to a factor of 1.41 compared to conventional methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的方法$\\nu$-Flows，使用条件归一化流和深度可逆神经网络限制高能对撞机实验中中微子动力学的似然空间。该方法允许恢复通常作为自由参数的完整中微子动量，并在给定事件观测的条件似然下对中微子值进行采样。我们通过将$\\nu$-Flows应用于模拟的半轻子$t\\bar{t}$事件的案例研究中展示了$\\nu$-Flows的成功，并显示它可以导致更准确的动量重建，特别是纵向坐标。我们还展示了这对于喷注关联的下游任务具有直接的好处，相对于传统方法，可以改善高达1.41倍。",
