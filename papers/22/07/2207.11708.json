Software vulnerability assessment provides important and multifaceted information to prevent and mitigate dangerous cyber-attacks in the wild. The key contributions include a systematisation of knowledge, along with a suite of novel data-driven techniques and practical recommendations for researchers and practitioners in the area. The thesis results help improve the understanding and inform the practice of assessing ever-increasing vulnerabilities in real-world software systems. This in turn enables more thorough and timely fixing prioritisation and planning of these critical security issues.",
