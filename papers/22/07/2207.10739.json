    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习工具的进步，不可避免地产生了一个问题：机器学习如何帮助我们编写更好的代码？随着GPT-3和Bert等模型在自然语言处理方面取得的重大进展，开始探索将自然语言处理技术应用于代码。大多数研究集中在自动程序修复（APR）上，虽然在合成或高度过滤的数据集上的结果很有前途，但这些模型很难应用于现实场景，因为存在定位漏洞不足的问题。我们提出BigIssue：一个真实的漏洞定位基准测试。基准测试的目标是两个方面。首先，我们提供了一个包含多种实际和合成Java漏洞的通用基准；第二，通过注意到完整存储库上下文，激励提高模型的漏洞定位能力。引入BigIssue后，我们希望推进漏洞定位技术的最新进展，从而提高APR的性能，并最终帮助开发人员编写更好的代码。",
