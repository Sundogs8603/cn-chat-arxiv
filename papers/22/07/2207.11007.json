In this paper, we will focus on the automatic detection of gradual drifts, a special type of change, in which the cases of two models overlap during a period of time. The proposed algorithm relies on conformance checking metrics to carry out the automatic detection of the changes, performing also a fully automatic classification of these changes into sudden or gradual.
