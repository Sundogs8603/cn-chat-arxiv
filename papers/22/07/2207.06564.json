    "translated_abstract": "Difference-in-differences（DiD）是一种常用的估计治疗效应的方法，平行趋势是其最主要的识别假设：未经处理结果的平均趋势必须与观察到的治疗状态无关。在观察设置中，治疗通常是由理性行为者（如政策制定者、公司或个体行为者）做出或影响的动态选择。本文将平行趋势假设与动态选择的经济模型联系起来，这些模型允许动态选择动机，如学习或最优停止。在这些情况下，我们阐明了平行趋势对代理行为的影响，并展示了这些选择动机如何在简单的环境中导致对平行趋势的违反，即使预期关注被排除在外或未经处理结果的平均值保持不变。最后，我们考虑了一些假设下的识别结果，以适应这些动态选择的特征。",
