    "abstract": "We generate a continuous measure of health to estimate a non-parametric model of health dynamics, showing that adverse health shocks are highly persistent when suffered by people in poor health. Canonical models cannot account for this pattern. We incorporate this health dynamic into a life-cycle model of consumption, savings, and labor force participation. After estimating the model parameters, we simulate the effects of health shocks on economic outcomes. We find that bad health shocks have long-term adverse economic effects that are more extreme for those in poor health. Furthermore, bad health shocks also increase the disparity of asset accumulation among this group of people. A canonical model of health dynamics would not reveal these effects.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们生成了一个连续的健康度量来估计健康动态的非参数模型，结果表明，当身体健康较差的人遭受不利健康冲击时，这些冲击具有很高的持续性。传统的模型无法解释这种模式。我们将这种健康动态纳入了一个生命周期模型中，该模型考虑了消费、储蓄和劳动力参与。在估计模型参数之后，我们模拟了健康冲击对经济结果的影响。我们发现，不良的健康冲击对经济有着长期的不利影响，对身体健康较差的人影响更加严重。此外，不良的健康冲击还增加了这一群体的资产积累差距。传统的健康动态模型无法揭示这些影响。",
