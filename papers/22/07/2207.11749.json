    "abstract": "Few existing studies focus on the source separation problem with unknown numbers of signals, and how to evaluate the performances of the systems is not yet clear. We propose a solution with a fixed number of output channels to address these two problems, enabling it to avoid the dimensional disaster caused by the permutation problem induced by the alignment of outputs to targets. Specifically, we propose a two-step algorithm based on autoencoders and a new performance evaluation method for situations with mute channels. Experiments conducted on simulated mixtures of radiated ship noise show that the proposed solution can achieve similar separation performance to that attained with a known number of signals. The proposed algorithm achieved competitive performance as two algorithms developed for known numbers of signals, which is highly explainable and extensible and get the state of the art under this framework.",

    "translated_abstract": "目前很少有研究关注未知数量信号的源分离问题，以及如何评估系统的性能尚不清楚。为了解决这两个问题，我们提出了一个具有固定输出通道数量的解决方案，避免了由于输出与目标对齐引起的排列问题导致的维度灾难。具体而言，我们提出了一个基于自动编码器的两步算法，并针对有静音通道的情况提出了一种新的性能评估方法。通过在模拟混合的辐射船噪声上进行的实验表明，所提出的解决方案可以达到与已知信号数量相似的分离性能。所提出的算法在已知信号数量的情况下取得了竞争性能，具有高度可解释性和可扩展性，并在该框架下达到了最先进的水平。",
