    "translated_abstract": "因果推断在电子商务和精准医学等领域有广泛应用，其性能严重依赖于个体治疗效果(ITE)的准确估计。传统上，通过分别在各自的样本空间中建模受治疗组和对照组的响应函数来预测ITE。然而，在实际应用中，这种方法通常遇到两个问题，即由于治疗偏差而导致的受治疗组和对照组之间的分布偏离，以及其人口规模之间的显著样本不平衡。本文提出了深度整体空间交叉网络(DESCN)，以端到端的方式建模治疗效果。DESCN通过一个跨网络以多任务学习的方式捕捉治疗倾向、响应和隐藏治疗效果的综合信息。我们的方法在整个样本空间中联合学习治疗和响应函数，以避免治疗偏差，并采用中间伪处理方式。",
