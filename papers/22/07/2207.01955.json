    "translated_abstract": "尽管交互式强化学习方案取得了很多有希望的结果，但目前的方案仍然依赖于来自顾问专家的被动监督信号，形式包括持续监控或预定义规则，这不可避免地导致了一种麻烦而昂贵的学习过程。在本文中，我们介绍了一种新的主动顾问演员-评论家框架，称为Ask-AC，它用一个双向的学习者主动机制替换了单向的顾问指导机制，从而实现了学习者和顾问之间的定制化和有效的信息交换。Ask-AC 的核心是两个互补的组件，分别是动作请求者和自适应状态选择器，可以方便地纳入各种离散的演员-评论家架构中。前者允许代理主动寻求不确定状态下的顾问干预，后者则可以识别漏掉的不稳定状态。",
