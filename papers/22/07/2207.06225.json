    "translated_abstract": "在提供当代数字营销体验时，推荐的时效性和上下文准确性变得越来越重要。传统的推荐系统通过考虑用户的过去购买记录向用户推荐相关但不受时间影响的物品。这些推荐只是符合用户的一般偏好，而不是用户在购买之前的具体需求。相反，考虑交易、购买或体验顺序来衡量用户演化偏好的推荐系统能够为用户提供更准确和有效的推荐：顺序推荐系统不仅能更好地理解用户当前需求的行为，还具有更好的预测能力。在本文中，我们利用一份包含超过2.7百万信用卡交易数据和46K个持卡人的生产数据集，展示并排名了顺序推荐系统的效果。该方法首先使用自编码器对原始的交易数据进行处理，然后提交观测数据进行预测。",
