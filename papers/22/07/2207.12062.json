    "abstract": "Model-based Reinforcement Learning and Control have demonstrated great potential in various sequential decision making problem domains, including in robotics settings. However, real-world robotics systems often present challenges that limit the applicability of those methods. In particular, we note two problems that jointly happen in many industrial systems: 1) Irregular/asynchronous observations and actions and 2) Dramatic changes in environment dynamics from an episode to another (e.g. varying payload inertial properties). We propose a general framework that overcomes those difficulties by meta-learning adaptive dynamics models for continuous-time prediction and control. The proposed approach is task-agnostic and can be adapted to new tasks in a straight-forward manner. We present evaluations in two different robot simulations and on a real industrial robot.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于模型的强化学习和控制在包括机器人环境在内的各种顺序决策问题领域展示了巨大的潜力。然而，真实世界的机器人系统常常存在一些限制这些方法的应用。我们提出了一个可以适应不规则/异步观察和行动以及在不同episode之间产生巨大的环境动力学变化（例如，不同的载荷惯性特性）的元学习自适应动力学模型的通用框架，该方法是任务无关的，并且可以简单地适应新任务。我们在两个不同的机器人模拟和一个真实的工业机器人上进行了评估。",
