    "translated_abstract": "用户嵌入（用户的向量化表示）在推荐系统中具有重要作用。已经提出了许多方法来构建用户的多维度表示，以便于检索任务中找到相似的物品，并且已经在工业推荐系统中被证明是有效的。最近人们发现使用多种嵌入（即多个维度的用户表示）来表示用户的兴趣是有用的，每个嵌入表示用户的某个主题兴趣。对于多兴趣表示，重要的是对用户在不同主题上的偏好进行建模，并且了解偏好随时间的变化情况。然而，现有方法要么无法估算用户对每个兴趣的好感度，要么不合理地假设每个用户对每个兴趣的兴趣强度会以相等的速率下降，从而降低了候选检索结果的查全率。在本文中，我们提出加权多兴趣检索模型（Multi-Interest Preference, MIP），通过利用深度学习方法为用户产生多个兴趣嵌入，并且可以对用户在多种兴趣下的偏好进行估计，从而提高候选检索结果的查全率。",
