    "translated_abstract": "流感病毒突变迅速，对公众健康，特别是脆弱群体构成威胁。在历史上，甲型流感病毒在不同物种之间引发过大流行。确定病毒的起源至关重要，以防止疫情的传播。最近，越来越多的人对使用机器学习算法进行病毒序列的快速准确预测产生了兴趣。本研究使用真实测试数据集和各种评估指标以不同分类水平评估机器学习算法。由于血凝素是免疫反应中的主要蛋白质，只使用血凝素序列，并以位置特异性评分矩阵和词嵌入表示。结果表明，5-grams-transformer神经网络是预测病毒序列起源最有效的算法，在较高分类水平上大约有99.54％的AUCPR，98.01％的F1得分和96.60％的MCC。",
