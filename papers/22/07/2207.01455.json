    "translated_abstract": "在许多应用中，如体育比赛或推荐系统，我们可以获得由一组$n$个项目（或选手）之间的成对比较组成的数据。目标是利用这些数据推断每个项目和/或它们的排名的潜在实力。现有结果主要关注单个比较图$G$的设置。然而，在某些情况下（如体育比赛），成对比较数据会随时间变化。对于这种动态设置，理论结果相对有限，是本文的重点。我们研究了翻译同步问题在动态设置下的扩展。在这个设置中，我们给定了一个比较图序列$(G_t)_{t\\in \\mathcal{T}}$，其中$\\mathcal{T} \\subset [0,1]$是表示时间域的格点，对于每个项目$i$和时间$t\\in \\mathcal{T}$，存在一个关联的未知实力参数$z^*_{t,i}\\in \\mathbb{R}$。",
