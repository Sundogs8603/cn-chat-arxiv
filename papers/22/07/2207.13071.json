    "abstract": "Combining many cross-sectional return predictors (for example, in machine learning) often requires imputing missing values. We compare ad-hoc mean imputation with several methods including maximum likelihood. Surprisingly, maximum likelihood and ad-hoc methods lead to similar results. This is because predictors are largely independent: Correlations cluster near zero and 10 principal components (PCs) span less than 50% of total variance. Independence implies observed predictors are uninformative about missing predictors, making ad-hoc methods valid. In PC regression tests, 50 PCs are required to capture equal-weighted expected returns (30 PCs value-weighted), regardless of the imputation. We find similar invariance in neural network portfolios.",

    "translated_abstract": "通过将许多横截面回报预测变量组合在一起（例如，在机器学习中），通常需要插值缺失值。我们比较了几种方法，包括最大似然估计和特定值估计。令人惊讶的是，最大似然估计和特定值估计产生了类似的结果。这是因为预测变量在很大程度上是独立的：相关性集群接近于零，10个主成分(PC)跨度少于总方差的50％。独立性意味着观察到的变量对缺失变量没有信息贡献，使特定方法有效。 在PC回归测试中，需要50个PC才能捕捉等权重期望回报（30个PC权值加权），不管imputation是什么。 我们发现神经网络投资组合中也有类似的不变性。",
    "tldr": "该研究比较了多种插值方法，发现预测变量通常独立，因此即使采用特定值估计，最终结果与最大似然估计相似。此外，50个主成分可捕捉等权重的期望回报，而使用神经网络投资组合也有类似的结果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study compares several interpolation methods and finds that predictors are largely independent, so even using ad-hoc methods leads to similar results as maximum likelihood estimation. Additionally, 50 principal components are required to capture equal-weighted expected returns, and similar results are found in neural network portfolios."
