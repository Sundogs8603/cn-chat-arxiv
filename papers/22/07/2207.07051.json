    "translated_abstract": "抽象推理是智能系统的关键能力。大型语言模型在抽象推理任务上实现了高于随机的性能，但存在许多不完善之处。然而，人类的抽象推理也是不完美的。例如，人类推理受到我们对真实世界的知识和信念的影响，并表现出显著的“内容效应”；当问题的语义内容支持正确的逻辑推理时，人类更可靠地进行推理。这些内容纠缠的推理模式在关于人类智能基本性质的争论中起着核心作用。在这里，我们研究了语言模型是否以类似的方式混入内容来回答逻辑问题，这些语言模型的先验期望捕捉了一些人类知识的特征。我们在三个逻辑推理任务上探索了这个问题：自然语言推理、判断三段论的逻辑有效性和Wason选择任务。我们评估了最先进的大型语言模型的性能。",
