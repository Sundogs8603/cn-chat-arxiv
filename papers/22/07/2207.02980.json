    "translated_abstract": "生物样本中的小分子可用于提供关于疾病状态、环境毒素、天然产物药物发现及许多其他应用的信息。串联质谱（MS2）是了解小分子混合物组成的主要界面，它产生的数据具有高灵敏度和百万分之一（ppm级别）的分辨率。我们采用针对 MS2 质谱数据中质量数据的多尺度正弦嵌入，旨在满足从完整 MS2 数据进行学习的挑战。利用这些嵌入，我们为光谱图书馆搜索提供了一种新的最先进模型，这是评估 MS2 数据的标准任务。我们还引入了一个新的任务——通过 MS2 数据进行化学性质预测——该任务在高通量 MS2 实验中具有自然应用，并且展示了在医药化学家优先考虑的 10 种化学性质中，可以实现对新化合物平均 R² 值为 80％。我们使用降维技术并进行实验来研究这些任务。",
