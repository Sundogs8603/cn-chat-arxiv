    "abstract": "This project involved participation in the DCASE 2022 Competition (Task 6) which had two subtasks: (1) Automated Audio Captioning and (2) Language-Based Audio Retrieval. The first subtask involved the generation of a textual description for audio samples, while the goal of the second was to find audio samples within a fixed dataset that match a given description. For both subtasks, the Clotho dataset was used. The models were evaluated on BLEU1, BLEU2, BLEU3, ROUGEL, METEOR, CIDEr, SPICE, and SPIDEr scores for audio captioning and R1, R5, R10 and mARP10 scores for audio retrieval. We have conducted a handful of experiments that modify the baseline models for these tasks. Our final architecture for Automated Audio Captioning is close to the baseline performance, while our model for Language-Based Audio Retrieval has surpassed its counterpart.",

    "translated_abstract": "本项目参加了DCASE 2022竞赛（任务6），其分为两个子任务：（1）自动音频字幕和（2）基于语言的音频检索。第一个子任务涉及为音频样本生成文本描述，而第二个子任务的目标是在固定数据集中查找与给定描述相匹配的音频样本。对于这两个子任务，使用了Clotho数据集。对于音频字幕，我们评估了BLEU1，BLEU2，BLEU3，ROUGEL，METEOR，CIDEr，SPICE和SPIDEr得分，而音频检索评估了R1，R5，R10和mARP10得分。我们进行了一些修改这些任务的基线模型的实验。我们针对自动音频字幕的最终架构接近于基线性能，而我们针对基于语言的音频检索的模型已超越了其对应模型。",
