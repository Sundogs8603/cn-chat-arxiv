We give a brief introduction of neural networks. Then we explore in more detail graph neural networks, a recent variant of neural networks suited for processing graph-structured inputs. We describe briefly the concept of reinforcement learning algorithms and some approaches designed to date. Next, we study some successful approaches combining neural networks for path-planning. Lastly, we focus on temporal planning problems with uncertainty.",
