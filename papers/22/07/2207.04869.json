    "translated_abstract": "分子表示学习(MRL)是建立机器学习和化学科学之间联系的关键一步。它将分子编码为数字向量，保留分子的结构和特征，从而可以进行下游任务（如性质预测）。最近，特别是基于深度分子图学习的方法取得了相当大的进展。在本综述中，我们系统地审查了这些基于图形的分子表示技术，特别是那些纳入化学领域知识的方法。具体而言，我们首先介绍了2D和3D分子图的特征。然后，我们根据其输入将MRL方法总结和分类为三组。此外，我们还讨论了MRL支持的一些典型化学应用程序。为了促进在这个快速发展的领域中的研究，我们还列出了本文中使用的基准和常用的数据集合。最后，我们分享了关于未来研究方向更易于解释和可解释的MRL模型的想法。",
