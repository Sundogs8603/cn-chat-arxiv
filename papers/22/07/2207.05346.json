    "translated_abstract": "尽管城市的相对规模随时间高度波动，但各个国家的城市规模分布都遵循近似的幂律定律。我们对美国和日本的实证证据表明，这种缩放定律源于空间分形结构，因为工业位置的协调而形成。虽然单个工业的位置随时间变化很大，但是有一个持续的模式，即在给定时间更局部的工业只在更大的城市中发现。城市的空间组织呈分层结构，更大的城市被间隔开来作为周围较小城市的中心，从而在不同的空间尺度上产生递归模式。在我们对观察到的本质复制的理论中，规模经济多样性导致其位置图案的多样性，通过工业和人口的空间协调转化为城市规模的多样性。城市规模的幂律定律",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the power-law distribution of city sizes in various countries, revealing its origin in the spatial fractal structure of cities resulting from the coordination of industrial locations. The hierarchical spatial organization of cities provides centers for smaller surrounding cities and generates a recursive pattern. The diversity in location patterns of industries due to scale economies leads to diversity in city sizes via spatial coordination of industries and population."
