    "translated_abstract": "心电图( ECG)是一种广泛使用的非侵入性诊断工具，用于检测心脏疾病。许多研究已经设计了ECG分析模型(如分类器)来辅助诊断。作为一个上游任务，研究人员建立生成模型来合成ECG数据，这有利于提供训练样本、隐私保护和注释减少。然而，以前的ECG生成方法往往既没有合成多视图数据，也没有处理心脏疾病情况。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的以疾病为导向的多视角ECG合成生成对抗网络ME-GAN，它获得了基于心脏疾病条件的全景心电图表示，并将这些表示投影到多个标准视图上以产生ECG信号。由于心脏疾病的ECG表现通常局部化在特定的波形中，我们提出了一种新的\"混合归一化\"方法，以将疾病信息精确地注入到合适的位置。",
