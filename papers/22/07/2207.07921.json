    "translated_abstract": "欧拉弹性纹理是一种吸引人的变分图像修复模型，它不仅涉及总变差，还涉及等高线曲率，这些特点使它在形状恢复任务中表现出色。然而，其梯度流是一种奇异、各向异性和非线性的四阶PDE，这在数值上具有挑战性：很难找到既能提供尖锐边缘又具有良好旋转不变性的高效算法。因此，我们设计了第一个使用欧拉弹性进行修复的神经算法：利用深能量的概念，将变分能量作为神经网络的损失函数。此外，我们结合了深图像先验，其中网络架构本身就充当了先验。这使得我们更接近于所需的解，得到了比现有算法更好的修复成果。在弹性纹理的形状恢复任务上，我们的结果在质量上与现有算法不相上下，能够结合良好的旋转不变性和尖锐的边缘。",
