    "abstract": "Ad hoc teamwork (AHT) is the challenge of designing a robust learner agent that effectively collaborates with unknown teammates without prior coordination mechanisms. Early approaches address the AHT challenge by training the learner with a diverse set of handcrafted teammate policies, usually designed based on an expert's domain knowledge about the policies the learner may encounter. However, implementing teammate policies for training based on domain knowledge is not always feasible. In such cases, recent approaches attempted to improve the robustness of the learner by training it with teammate policies generated by optimising information-theoretic diversity metrics. The problem with optimising existing information-theoretic diversity metrics for teammate policy generation is the emergence of superficially different teammates.

    "translated_abstract": "临时团队协作(AHT)是设计一个强大的学习代理的挑战，该代理能够在没有先前协调机制的情况下有效地与未知的队友合作。早期的方法通过使用多样化的手工制作的队友策略来训练学习者来解决AHT问题，这些策略通常是基于专家对学习者可能遇到的策略的领域知识进行设计的。然而，为基于领域知识的训练实现队友策略并不总是可行的。在这种情况下，最近的方法试图通过训练学习者使用通过优化信息理论多样性度量生成的队友策略来提高其稳健性。优化现有的信息理论多样性度量以用于生成队友策略的问题在于会出现表面上不同的队友。当用于AHT训练时，表面上不同的队友行为可能无法提高学习者在与未知的队友协作时的稳健性。",
