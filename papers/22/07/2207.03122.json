    "translated_abstract": "智能学习诊断是智能辅导系统的重要引擎，旨在估计学习者当前的知识掌握状况并预测其未来的学习表现。传统的学习诊断方法在诊断准确性和可解释性之间难以平衡。尽管现有的基于心理测量的学习诊断方法通过认知参数提供了一定领域解释，但它们对于大规模学习数据的建模能力不足。而基于深度学习的学习诊断方法虽然提高了学习表现预测的准确性，但其内在的黑盒特性导致缺乏可解释性，使得在教育应用中无法信任其结果。为解决以上问题，本文提出了统一可解释智能学习诊断框架，该框架结合了深度学习的强大表示学习能力和基于心理测量的方法的可解释性。该框架由深度神经网络诊断模块和认知参数解释模块两部分组成，两个模块相互补充，使得框架在准确性和可解释性之间达到平衡。实验结果表明，所提出的框架在准确性和可解释性方面优于现有的学习诊断方法。",
