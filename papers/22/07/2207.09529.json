    "translated_abstract": "流行性空气传播疾病，如COVID-19的监测通常涉及呼吸评估。虽然听诊是初步筛查疾病症状的主流方法，但需要专门的医院访问，限制了其效用。基于便携式设备上呼吸声记录的远程监测是一种有前途的替代方案，它可以协助早期评估首要影响下呼吸道的COVID-19。在这项研究中，我们介绍了一种新的深度学习方法，可以通过咳嗽或呼吸声的音频记录区分COVID-19患者和健康对照组。所提出的方法利用呼吸声的谱图表示中的一种新型谱图层级转换器（HST）。 HST在谱图中的局部窗口上具有自我关注机制，并且窗口大小随着模型阶段的逐渐增长而逐渐增加，以捕获本地到全局上下文。 HST与最先进的卷积神经网络模型进行了比较。",
