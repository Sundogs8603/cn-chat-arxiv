    "translated_abstract": "循环神经网络（RNN）是一类从人工智能范式中出现的神经网络，已经在自然语言处理领域取得了许多有趣的进展。有趣的是，这些架构被证明是近似量子系统基态的强大ansatze。在这里，我们在二维空间中建立在[Phys. Rev. Research 2, 023358 (2020)]的结果之上，并构建了一个更强大的二维RNN波函数ansatz。我们使用对称性和退火来获得在方形格和三角形格上二维海森堡模型基态能量的准确估计。我们表明，相较于密度矩阵重整化群（DMRG），我们的方法在三角形格的系统尺寸大于或等于$14 \\times 14$时更为优越。",
