    "translated_abstract": "随着树库质量的不断提高，树库在自然语言处理工具开发中发挥的关键作用日益增加。创建这种树库需要极大的人力和时间成本。特别是考虑到树库的规模时，支持标注过程的工具至关重要。虽然已经提出了各种标注工具，但对于像土耳其语这样的粘聚性语言往往不适用。 BoAT v1是为标注依存关系而开发的，随后用于创建手动标注的BOUN树库（UD_Turkish-BOUN）。在这项工作中，我们报道了一个基于BoAT v1使用经验的设计和实现的依存注释工具BoAT v2，发现了一些改进的机会。BoAT v2是一个多用户和基于Web的依存注释工具，其设计侧重于注释者的用户体验以产生有效的注释。",
