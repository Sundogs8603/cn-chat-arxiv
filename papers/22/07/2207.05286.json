    "abstract": "We focus on the problem of producing well-calibrated out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors, in order to enable safe deployment of medical image classifiers. Motivated by the difficulty of curating suitable calibration datasets, synthetic augmentations have become highly prevalent for inlier/outlier specification. While there have been rapid advances in data augmentation techniques, this paper makes a striking finding that the space in which the inliers and outliers are synthesized, in addition to the type of augmentation, plays a critical role in calibrating OOD detectors. Using the popular energy-based OOD detection framework, we find that the optimal protocol is to synthesize latent-space inliers along with diverse pixel-space outliers. Based on empirical studies with multiple medical imaging benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach consistently leads to superior OOD detection ($15\\% - 35\\%$ in AUROC) over the state-of-the-art in a variety of open-set recognition settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文关注如何产生良好校准的医学图像OOD探测器，以便安全部署。由于筛选出合适的校准数据集较为困难，因此合成增强技术在内线/外线特定方面已广泛使用。本文发现，在内线和外线的合成空间以及增强类型方面还存在着一些需要注意的问题，这对于OOD探测器的校准至关重要。在流行的基于能量的OOD探测框架中，我们发现最佳协议是合成潜空间内线和多样化的像素空间外线。通过对多个医学成像基准进行实证研究，我们证明了我们的方法在各种开放式识别设置中始终优于现有技术，OOD检测的AUROC可相对提高$15％-35％$",
