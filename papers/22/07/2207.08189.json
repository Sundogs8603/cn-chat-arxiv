The algorithm generates new solutions through Markov-chain Monte Carlo techniques. This sampling scheme can result in severe limitations, such as slow convergence and a tendency to stay within the same local search space at small temperatures. To overcome these shortcomings, we use the variational classical annealing (VCA) framework that combines autoregressive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with traditional annealing to sample solutions that are uncorrelated. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of using VCA as an approach to solving real-world optimization problems.

    "translated_abstract": "组合优化问题通常通过启发式算法（如模拟退火）来求解，以通过热力波动在大的搜索空间中寻找最优解。该算法通过马尔科夫链蒙特卡洛技术生成新的解。这种采样方案可能会导致严重的局限性，比如收敛速度慢且在低温下倾向于停留在相同的局部搜索空间中。为了克服这些缺点，我们使用了变分经典退火（VCA）框架，将自回归循环神经网络（RNNs）与传统退火相结合，以采样不相关的解。在本文中，我们展示了使用VCA作为解决实际优化问题的方法的潜力。我们探索比较了VCA与模拟退火在解决三个流行的优化问题中的性能：最大割问题（Max-Cut）、护士排班问题（NSP）和旅行商问题（TSP）。",
