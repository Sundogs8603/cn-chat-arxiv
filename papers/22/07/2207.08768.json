    "translated_abstract": "近期的研究揭示了损失函数设计中区分个体损失与聚合损失的重要范式。个体损失评估模型在样本上的质量，而聚合损失将每个训练样本的个体损失/分数组合起来。两者都有一个共同的过程，将一组个体值聚合成单个数字值。排名顺序反映了设计损失中个体值之间最基本的关系。此外，可分解性，其中损失可以分解为一组个体项的集合，成为组织损失/分数的重要属性。本综述系统全面地回顾了机器学习中的基于排名可分解损失函数。具体而言，我们提供了一个按聚合损失和个体损失视角的新损失函数分类法。我们确定了形成这种损失的聚合器，它们是集合函数的示例。我们组织了有监督学习和无监督学习中的基于排名的可分解损失。我们讨论了损失的可分解性与优化算法之间的相互作用。最后，我们概述了排名损失在深度学习中的最新应用和面临的挑战。",
