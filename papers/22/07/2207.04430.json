    "translated_abstract": "数据日益复杂，需要能够有效处理复杂结构的方法和模型，因为简化这些结构会导致信息丢失。虽然已经开发了多种分析工具来处理复杂数据对象的原始形式，但这些工具通常仅限于单一类型的变量。在本文中，我们提出了能量树作为回归和分类模型，能够容纳各种类型的结构化协变量。能量树利用能量统计量扩展了条件推断树的能力，从中继承了健全的统计基础、可解释性、尺度不变性和无分布假设的自由。我们特别关注功能和图形结构协变量，同时还突出了该模型在整合其他变量类型方面的灵活性。广泛的模拟研究表明，该模型在变量选择和抗过拟合的鲁棒性方面具有竞争性表现，以及对不同数据结构的适应能力。我们展示了能量树在实际数据集分析中的灵活性，包括功能数据、基因表达和社交网络。",
