The existence of syntactic rules induces correlations among neighboring words. Using an ordinal pattern approach, we present an analysis of lexical statistical connections for 11 major languages.

Taken together, our results emphasize the relevance of ordinal time series analysis in linguistic typology, historical linguistics and stylometry.",

    "translated_abstract": "单词是连接思想和事物的基本语言单位，但单词不会单独出现在文本序列中。句法规则的存在导致邻近单词之间存在相关性。使用序数模式方法，我们对11种主要语言的词汇统计关系进行了分析。我们发现，语言利用各种不同方式来表达单词关系，产生了独特的模式结构分布。此外，对于给定语言的这些模式分布的波动，可以帮助我们确定文本撰写的历史时期和作者。综上所述，我们的结果强调序数时间序列分析在语言类型学、历史语言学和文体学中的相关性。",
