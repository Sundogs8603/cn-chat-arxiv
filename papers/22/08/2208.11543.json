    "abstract": "Recently, Electrical Distribution Systems are extensively penetrated with the Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to cater the energy demands with general perception that it enhances the system resiliency. However, it may be adverse for the grid operation due to various factors like its intermittent availability, dynamics in weather condition, introduction of nonlinearity, complexity etc. This needs a detailed understanding of system resiliency that our method proposes here. We introduce a methodology using complex network theory to identify the resiliency of distribution system when incorporated with Solar PV generation under various undesirable configurations. Complex correlated networks for different conditions were obtained and various network parameters were computed for identifying the resiliency of those networks. The proposed methodology identifies the hosting capacity of solar panels in the system while maintaining the resiliency under different unwanted conditions hence helps",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，电力配电系统广泛采用分布式能源资源（DER）以满足能源需求，普遍认为这可以提高系统的弹性。然而，由于各种因素（如间歇性可用性、天气条件的动态变化、非线性等）可能对电网运营产生不利影响。本文提出了一种使用复杂网络理论来识别带有太阳能光伏发电的配电系统弹性的方法。我们根据不同条件获得了不同条件下的复杂相关网络，并计算了各种网络参数，以识别网络的弹性。所提出的方法可以识别系统中太阳能电池板的托管能力，并在不同不良条件下保持系统的弹性，从而有助于提高系统的韧性。",
