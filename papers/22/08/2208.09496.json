Using ousiometrics, a reinterpretation of the valence-arousal-dominance framework of meaning obtained from semantic differentials, we convert text into time series of power and danger scores in cumulative word-time. Each time series is then decomposed using empirical mode decomposition into a sum of constituent oscillatory modes and a non-oscillatory trend.
