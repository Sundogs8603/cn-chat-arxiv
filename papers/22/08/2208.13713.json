    "abstract": "Online advertising has recently grown into a highly competitive and complex multi-billion-dollar industry, with advertisers bidding for ad slots at large scales and high frequencies. This has resulted in a growing need for efficient \"auto-bidding\" algorithms that determine the bids for incoming queries to maximize advertisers' targets subject to their specified constraints. This work explores efficient online algorithms for a single value-maximizing advertiser under an increasingly popular constraint: Return-on-Spend (RoS). We quantify efficiency in terms of regret relative to the optimal algorithm, which knows all queries a priori.  We contribute a simple online algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret in expectation while always respecting the specified RoS constraint when the input sequence of queries are i.i.d. samples from some distribution. We also integrate our results with the previous work of Balseiro, Lu, and Mirrokni [BLM20] to achieve near-optimal regret while respecting",

    "translated_abstract": "在线广告业近年来成长为一个竞争激烈且复杂的数十亿美元行业，广告商在大规模和高频率下进行广告位竞价。这导致需求增加了对于高效的\"自动竞价\"算法，以确定最大化广告商目标的投标价格，同时满足特定的限制条件。本研究探讨了单个最大化价值广告商面临的越来越流行的限制条件之一：投放成本回报率（RoS）。我们以相对于知道所有查询的最优算法的遗憾值为衡量标准来量化效率。我们提出了一个简单的在线算法，当查询序列是来自某个分布的独立同分布样本时，该算法在期望值上实现了接近最优的遗憾值，同时始终遵守指定的RoS约束。我们还将我们的结果与Balseiro、Lu和Mirrokni [BLM20]的先前工作相结合，以在尊重约束的同时实现接近最优的遗憾值。",
