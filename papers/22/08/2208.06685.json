    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了半监督的新颖检测问题，研究人员可以获得一组“典型”测量数据。受到多重检验和符合推断的最新进展的启发，我们提出了AdaDetect，一种灵活的方法，能够适用于任何概率分类算法，并在有限样本中控制检测到的新颖性的假发现率（FDR），而无需除了可交换性以外的任何分布假设。与通常预先指定p值函数的经典FDR控制方法不同，AdaDetect以数据自适应的方式学习变换，将功率集中在区分内点和外点的方向上。受多重检验文献的启发，我们进一步提出了适应于空值比例的AdaDetect变体，同时保持有限样本的FDR控制。这些方法在合成数据集和真实数据集上进行了演示，包括一个应用程序。",
