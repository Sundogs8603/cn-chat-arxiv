Previous approaches to this problem suffer from over-weighting historical data and thus may fail to quickly react to the underlying dynamics. Here we correct this issue and develop a novel procedure with provably small regret over all local time intervals of a given width. We achieve this by modifying the adaptive conformal inference (ACI) algorithm of Gibbs and Cand\\`{e}s (2021) to contain an additional step in which the step-size parameter of ACI's gradient descent update is tuned over time. Crucially, this means that unlike ACI, which requires knowledge of the rate of change of the data-generating mechanism, our new procedure is adaptive to both the size and type of the distribution shift. Our methods are highly flexible and can be used in combination with any baseline predictive algorithm that produces point estimates or estimated quantile",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在一个在线环境中形成预测集的问题，其中生成数据的分布允许随时间变化。先前的方法在这个问题上存在历史数据的过重权重，因此可能无法快速应对底层动态。在这里，我们纠正了这个问题，并开发了一种新的过程，对于给定宽度的所有局部时间间隔都有可证明的小遗憾。我们通过修改Gibbs和Cand\\`{e}s（2021）的自适应一致推断（ACI）算法，在ACI的梯度下降更新中添加了一个额外的步骤，以在时间上调整步长参数。关键是，这意味着与需要知道数据生成机制变化速率的ACI不同，我们的新过程对分布变化的大小和类型都是自适应的。我们的方法非常灵活，可以与任何产生点估计或估计分位数的基准预测算法结合使用",
