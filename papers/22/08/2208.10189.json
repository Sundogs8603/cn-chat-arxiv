    "abstract": "We investigate Gately's solution concept for cooperative games with transferable utilities. Gately's conception introduced a bargaining solution that minimises the maximal quantified ``propensity to disrupt'' the negotiation process of the players over the allocation of the generated collective payoffs. Gately's solution concept is well-defined for a broad class of games. We also consider a generalisation based on a parameter-based quantification of the propensity to disrupt. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship of these generalised Gately values with the Core and the Nucleolus and show that Gately's solution is in the Core for all regular 3-player games. We identify exact conditions under which generally these Gately values are Core imputations for arbitrary regular cooperative games. Finally, we investigate the relationship of the Gately value with the Shapley value.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了具有可转让效用的合作博弈中的盖泰解概念。盖泰的概念引入了一种谈判解决方案，该解决方案最小化了谈判过程中玩家对分配生成的集体收益的“破坏倾向”的最大量化。盖泰的解决方案对于广泛的游戏类别是明确定义的。我们还考虑了基于参数数量化的破坏倾向的一种推广。此外，我们研究了这些广义盖泰值与核心和核值之间的关系，并且证明了在所有正则的三人游戏中，盖泰解在核心内。我们确定了在一般合作博弈中，通常情况下这些盖泰值是核心分配的确切条件。最后，我们研究了盖泰值与沙普利值之间的关系。",
