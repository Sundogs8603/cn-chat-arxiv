    "abstract": "To understand a narrative, it is essential to comprehend the temporal event flows, especially those associated with main characters; however, this can be challenging with lengthy and unstructured narrative texts. To address this, we introduce NECE, an open-access, document-level toolkit that automatically extracts and aligns narrative events in the temporal order of their occurrence. Through extensive evaluations, we show the high quality of the NECE toolkit and demonstrates its downstream application in analyzing narrative bias regarding gender. We also openly discuss the shortcomings of the current approach, and potential of leveraging generative models in future works. Lastly the NECE toolkit includes both a Python library and a user-friendly web interface, which offer equal access to professionals and layman audience alike, to visualize event chain, obtain narrative flows, or study narrative bias.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了理解一个故事，理解事件的时间流动尤为重要，尤其是与主要角色相关的事件；然而，对于冗长和非结构化的故事文本，这可能是具有挑战性的。为了解决这个问题，我们介绍了NECE，一个开放获取的、基于文档级别的工具包，它可以自动提取和对齐故事事件，按照它们发生的时间顺序排列。通过广泛的评估，我们展示了NECE工具包的高质量，并展示了它在分析与性别相关的故事偏见方面的应用。我们还公开讨论了当前方法的缺点，以及未来工作中利用生成模型的潜力。最后，NECE工具包包括一个Python库和一个用户友好的Web界面，为专业人员和普通大众提供平等的访问权，可以可视化事件链，获取故事流程，或者研究故事偏见。",
