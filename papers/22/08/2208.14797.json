    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们考虑一个 ${\\rm U}(1)$-connection 图，即一个图，其中每条有向边都赋予一个单位模复数，在反向时取共轭。对于组合 Laplacian 的一个自然替代物是磁 Laplacian，一个包含了关于图连接信息的 Hermite 矩阵。磁 Laplacians 在角度同步问题中出现。在大而密集的图的背景下，我们研究了磁 Laplacian $\\Delta$ 的稀疏化，即基于具有少量边的子图的谱近似。我们的方法依赖于使用自定义行列式点过程对多类型生成森林（MTSFs）进行抽样，这是一个概率分布，有利于多样性。简而言之，MTSF 是一个生成子图，其连通分量为树或环根树。",
