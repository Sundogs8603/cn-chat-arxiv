    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一个全连接的种植自旋玻璃模型，称为种植的XY模型。研究该系统的动机来自自旋玻璃领域和统计推断领域，其中它模拟了角度同步问题。我们使用近似传递消息（AMP）算法和其状态演化（SE）推导出了温度-铁磁偏置平面上的复制对称（RS）相图。在Nishimori线上（即当温度与铁磁偏差匹配时），RS预测是精确的，但当参数不匹配时，它们变得不准确，产生了一个自旋玻璃相，其中AMP无法收敛。为了克服RS近似的缺陷，我们进行了一步副本对称性破缺（1RSB）分析，基于近似调查传播（ASP）算法。利用ASP的状态演化，我们计算了测量中的亚稳态数目，推导出了1RSB自由熵，并发现了其行为。",
