    "translated_abstract": "当回报向量遵循比正态分布更一般的分布时，在闭合形式中获得最大效用的最优投资组合是一个具有挑战性的问题。在本文中，我们给出了在仅基于有限资产的市场中，当回报向量遵循正态均值方差混合模型时，最大化期望指数效用的最优投资组合的闭合形式表达式。然后，我们还考虑了基于正态均值方差混合模型的大型金融市场，并证明在指数效用下，基于小型市场的最优效用会收敛到大型金融市场中的最优效用。该结果特别表明，为了达到最优效用水平，投资者需要通过将无限多的资产包含在其投资组合中进行多样化，并且基于仅有有限资产集合的投资组合，他们永远无法达到最优效用水平。本文还考虑了更加复杂的投资组合优化问题。",
