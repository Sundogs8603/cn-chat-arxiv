    "translated_abstract": "连续随机微分方程（SDE）的扩散模型在图像生成方面表现出卓越性能。它可以作为解决磁共振（MR）重建中逆问题的深度生成先验。然而，在快速MR成像中，$k$-空间数据的低频区域通常是完全采样的，而现有的扩散模型是在整个图像或$k$-空间中进行的，这必然会引入低频区域重建的不确定性。此外，现有的扩散模型通常需要大量的迭代才能收敛，导致重建过程耗时。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的SDE，专门用于带有高频空间扩散过程的MR重建（称为HFS-SDE）。该方法确保了完全采样的低频区域的确定性，并加速了逆扩散过程中的采样过程。在公开可用的实验数据集上进行实验，结果表明我们的方法在加速MRI重建中取得了良好的性能。",
