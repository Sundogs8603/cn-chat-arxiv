    "translated_abstract": "近似信息传递（AMP）作为一种高效的迭代范式，已经被广泛应用于高维统计问题的求解中。然而，以往AMP理论主要集中在高维渐近性方面，未能预测当迭代次数超过$o\\big(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}\\big)$（其中$n$是问题的维度）时AMP的动态。为了解决这个问题，本文建立了一个非渐近的框架，用于理解锥形矩阵估计中的AMP。我们基于新的AMP更新分解和可控残差项，提出了一种分析方法，以表征独立初始化情况下AMP的有限样本行为，并进一步推广到包括谱初始化的情况。作为这种分析方法的两个具体应用，当解决$\\mathbb{Z}_2$同步问题时，我们预测了谱初始化AMP的行为，最多可以进行$O\\big(\\frac{n}{\\mathrm{poly}\\log n}\\big)$个迭代。",
