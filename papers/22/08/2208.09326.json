In recent times, a few auctions (e.g., [13, 18]) were designed that appropriately incentivized the intermediate nodes on the network to promulgate the information to potentially more valuable bidders.

    "translated_abstract": "单件不可分割物品的拍卖是机制设计中最广泛讨论的问题之一。尽管其简单性，但它提供了文献中可能是最干净和最有洞察力的结果。当每个参与者都知道拍卖正在进行时，Myerson [20]提供了一个具有创造性的结果，以确定激励相容的拍卖和最大收入。然而，在网络上的拍卖中，这样的结果并不成立，因为拍卖的信息是通过代理传播的，他们需要激励来传递信息。最近，一些拍卖（例如[13, 18]）被设计成适当激励网络上的中间节点来传播信息给更有价值的竞标者。在本文中，我们提供了一个类似于Myerson的激励相容拍卖的特征，并且表明当前已知的拍卖属于这类随机拍卖的范畴。",
