    "translated_abstract": "城市自动驾驶的决策是具有挑战性的，由于交通参与者的随机性和道路结构的复杂性。尽管基于强化学习（RL）的决策方案在处理城市驾驶场景方面很有前景，但它的采样效率低且适应性差。在本文中，我们提出了Scene-Rep Transformer来改善RL决策能力，通过更好的场景表示编码和顺序预测潜在蒸馏。具体而言，我们构建了一个多阶段Transformer（MST）编码器，用于建模自车与其邻居之间的交互意识以及代理者与候选路径之间的意图意识。我们采用了一个具有自监督学习目标的顺序潜在Transformer（SLT），将未来的预测信息蒸馏到潜在的场景表示中，以减少探索空间并加快训练。",
