    "abstract": "Using administrative data on all induced abortions recorded in Spain in 2019, we analyze the characteristics of women undergoing repeat abortions and the spacing between these procedures. Our findings indicate that compared to women experiencing their first abortion, those who undergo repeat abortions are more likely to have lower education levels, have dependent children, live alone, or be foreign-born, with a non-monotonic relationship with age. We also report that being less educated, not employed, having dependent children, or being foreign-born are all strongly related to a higher number of repeat abortions. Lastly, we find that being less educated, foreign-born, or not employed is correlated with a shorter time interval between the last two abortions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文利用西班牙2019年记录的所有人工流产的行政数据，分析了进行反复堕胎的妇女特征和这些手术之间的间隔。我们的发现表明，与首次堕胎的妇女相比，进行反复堕胎的妇女更可能具有较低的教育水平、有抚养子女、单身或外来人口，并且与年龄呈非单调关系。我们还报告了未受教育、无业、有抚养子女或外来出生等因素都与反复堕胎次数增加密切相关。最后，我们发现未受教育、外来出生或无业与最后两次堕胎之间的时间间隔较短相关。",
