    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了1960年盖尔发表的一篇重要论文。该论文给出了一个需求函数的候选者的例子，它满足显式偏好的弱公理，但却存在争议，它是否是某个弱序的需求函数。我们对这篇论文进行了细致的解读，首先审查了盖尔所证明的内容，然后我们发现了盖尔证明中的一个缺口，并且证明了他未能证明这个需求函数候选者不是一个需求函数。接着，我们提出了三个完整的证明来证明盖尔的主张。第一个证明是基于Gale本人所证明的事实，第二个证明是使用Shephard引理，简单而现代化，第三个证明是沿着盖尔最初构思的方向进行的。我们的结论是：尽管在1960年，盖尔未能证明所构建的需求函数候选者不是一个需求函数，但他基本证明了它，因此可以说，该需求函数候选者不是一个需求函数。",
