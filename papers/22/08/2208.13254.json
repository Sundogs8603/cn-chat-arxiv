    "abstract": "The global economy is one of today's major challenges, with increasing relevance in recent decades. A frequent observation by policy makers is the lack of tools that help at least to understand, if not predict, economic crises. Currently, macroeconomic modeling is dominated by Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models. The limitations of DSGE in coping with the complexity of today's global economy are often recognized and are the subject of intense research to find possible solutions. As an alternative or complement to DSGE, the last two decades have seen the rise of agent-based models (ABM). An attractive feature of ABM is that it can model very complex systems because it is a bottom-up approach that can describe the specific behavior of heterogeneous agents. The main obstacle, however, is the large number of parameters that need to be known or calibrated. To enable the use of ABM with data from the real-world economy, this paper describes an agent-based macroeconomic model",

    "translated_abstract": "全球经济是当今的主要挑战之一，在近几十年中变得越来越重要。政策制定者经常观察到缺乏工具，帮助至少理解（如果不能预测）经济危机。目前，动态随机一般均衡（DSGE）模型主导宏观经济建模。DSGE 模型在应对当今全球经济的复杂性方面的局限性经常被承认，并成为研究如何找到可能的解决方案的热点。作为 DSGE 的替代方案或补充，过去二十年出现了代理人模型 (ABM) 的兴起。ABM 的一个吸引力特征是它可以模拟非常复杂的系统，因为它是一种自下而上的方法，可以描述异质性代理人的特定行为。然而，主要障碍是需要了解或校准的大量参数。为了让 ABM 与实际经济数据一起使用，本文描述了一个基于代理人的宏观经济模型。",
