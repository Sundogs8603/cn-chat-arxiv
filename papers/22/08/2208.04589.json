    "translated_abstract": "在许多实际应用，如营销和医学中，基于短期代理来估计长期因果效应是一个重要而具有挑战性的问题。尽管某些领域中已有所成功，但大多数现有方法以一种理想化和简化的方式估计因果效应，忽略了短期结果之间的因果结构，并将它们全部视为代理。然而，这种方法无法很好地应用于真实世界的情景，其中局部观察到的代理与它们在短期结果中的代理混合在一起。因此，我们开发了一种灵活的方法，称为Laser，以在更现实的情况下估计长期因果效应，其中观察到代理或具有观察代理。鉴于代理和代理之间的不可区分性，我们利用可识别变分自编码器（iVAE）在不需要区分观察到的代理或先验条件的情况下恢复所有有效代理候选者上的整个有效代理。",
