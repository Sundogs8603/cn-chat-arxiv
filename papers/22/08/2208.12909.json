    "translated_abstract": "深度学习在神经影像领域得到了广泛应用，包括从磁共振成像（MRI）体积中预测脑-表型关系。MRI数据通常需要在建模之前进行广泛的预处理，但是不同的MRI预处理管线引入的变异性可能导致不同的科学发现，即使使用相同的数据。在数据为中心的视角下，我们首先评估预处理管线选择对监督学习模型的下游性能的影响。然后，我们提出了两种管线不变表示学习方法（MPSL和PXL），以提高分类性能的鲁棒性并捕捉相似的神经网络表示。通过使用来自英国生物库（UK Biobank）数据集的2000名人体对象，我们展示了所提出的模型的独特和共享优势，特别是MPSL可用于改善新管线的外部样本泛化能力，而PXL可用于改善同一样本在不同管线间的性能一致性。",
