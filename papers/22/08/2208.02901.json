    "abstract": "We approach the problem of designing an automated trading strategy that can consistently profit by adapting to changing market conditions. This challenge can be framed as a Nonstationary Continuum-Armed Bandit (NCAB) problem. To solve the NCAB problem, we propose PRBO, a novel trading algorithm that uses Bayesian optimization and a ``bandit-over-bandit'' framework to dynamically adjust strategy parameters in response to market conditions. We use Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) to simulate financial markets containing heterogeneous populations of automated trading agents and compare PRBO with PRSH, a reference trading strategy that adapts strategy parameters through stochastic hill-climbing. Results show that PRBO generates significantly more profit than PRSH, despite having fewer hyperparameters to tune. The code for PRBO and performing experiments is available online open-source (https://github.com/HarmoniaLeo/PRZI-Bayesian-Optimisation).",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了设计一种自动化交易策略来适应不断变化着的市场状况的挑战。这个问题可以视为一个非稳态连续赌臂问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为PRBO的新型交易算法，它使用贝叶斯优化和“赌臂机中的赌臂机”框架来根据市场状况动态调整策略参数。我们使用Bristol股票交易所（BSE）来模拟包含异质自动交易代理人群体的金融市场，并将PRBO与通过随机爬山法调整策略参数的参考交易策略PRSH进行比较。结果表明，尽管要调整的超参数更少，但PRBO产生的利润显著高于PRSH。 PRBO的代码和实验数据已在GitHub上开源提供（https://github.com/HarmoniaLeo/PRZI-Bayesian-Optimisation）。",
