We argue that the standard model of limited attention cannot help the observer greatly. To address this issue, we study a family of models of choice under limited attention by imposing an attention floor in the decision process. We construct an algorithm that recovers the revealed preference relation given an incomplete data set in these models. Next, we take these models to the experimental data. We first show that assuming that subjects make at least one comparison before finalizing decisions (that is, an attention floor of 2) is almost costless in terms of describing the behavior when compared to the standard model of limited attention. In terms of revealed preferences, on the other hand, the amended model does significantly better. We can not recover any preferences for 63% of the subjects in the standard model, while the amended model reveals so",

    "translated_abstract": "观察者希望从决策者的选择中了解其福祉。她认为决策是在有限注意力下做出的。我们认为有限注意力的标准模型不能够很好地帮助观察者。为了解决这个问题，我们研究了一类在有限注意力下的选择模型，通过在决策过程中引入一个注意力底线。我们构建了一个算法，在这些模型中给定一个不完整的数据集合，来恢复出揭示性偏好关系。接下来，我们将这些模型应用到实验数据中。首先，我们表明假设被试在最终决策之前至少进行一次比较（也就是注意力底线为2）在描述行为方面几乎没有成本，与有限注意力的标准模型相比。然而，在揭示性偏好方面，修改后的模型表现更好。在标准模型中，我们不能恢复63%的被试的偏好，而修正后的模型可以恢复出更多的偏好。",
