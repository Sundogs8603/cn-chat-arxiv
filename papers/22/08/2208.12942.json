    "translated_abstract": "神经点估计器是一种将数据映射到参数点估计的神经网络。它们快速、无需似然函数，并且由于它们的平均特性，易于进行基于自举的不确定性量化。本文旨在提高统计学家对于这种相对较新的推断工具的认识，并通过提供用户友好的开源软件来促进其采用。我们还关注了从重复数据进行推断的广泛问题，在神经设置中使用排列不变神经网络来解决这个问题。通过广泛的模拟研究，我们展示了这些神经点估计器可以快速且最优地（从贝叶斯意义上）在弱识别和高参数化模型中进行估计，并且相对容易。我们通过对红海极端海表温度分析来证明它们的适用性，在训练之后，我们获得了参数估计和基于自举的置信区间。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a fast and likelihood-free inference tool, namely neural point estimators. These estimators can be easily bootstrapped for uncertainty quantification, and are demonstrated to perform well in weakly-identified and highly-parameterised models through simulation studies and a real-world example of extreme sea-surface temperature in the Red Sea."
