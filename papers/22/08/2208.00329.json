To facilitate this goal, we introduce a new crowdsourced English-language, Participant States dataset, PASTA. This dataset contains inferable participant states; a counterfactual perturbation to each state; and the changes to the story that would be necessary if the counterfactual were true. We introduce three state-based reasoning tasks that test for the ability to infer when a state is entailed by a story, to revise a story conditioned on a counterfactual state, and to explain the most likely state change given a revised story.

    "translated_abstract": "叙述中的事件通过参与者的潜在状态被理解为一个连贯整体。通常情况下，这些参与者状态并没有明确提及，而是需要读者进行推断。一个理解叙述的模型应该能够推断这些隐含的状态，甚至可以推理出这些状态的变化对叙述的影响。为了达到这个目标，我们介绍了一个新的众包英文数据集——参与者状态数据集（PASTA）。这个数据集包含了可以推断的参与者状态，每个状态都有一个与之相对应的反事实扰动，以及如果反事实成立则叙述需要进行的变化。我们提出了三个基于状态的推理任务，用于测试模型是否能够推断出一个状态是否被故事所蕴含、在一个反事实状态的条件下对故事进行修正、以及在修正后的故事中最可能的状态变化是什么。实验证明，现今的语言模型在一定程度上能够进行状态推理，但还存在许多局限性。",

    "en_tdlr": "PASTA is a new dataset for modeling participant states in narratives. Through inferring implicit states and understanding the impact of state changes on the narrative, PASTA is validated in three state-based reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that current language models can reason about states to some extent, but there are limitations."
