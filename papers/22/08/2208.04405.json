    "translated_abstract": "本研究研究了图形结构识别问题，即恢复时间序列的依存关系图。我们将这些时间序列数据建模为线性随机网络动态系统状态的组成部分。我们假设部分可观察性，仅观测到包含网络的子集的状态演化。我们设计了一种新的特征向量，从观察到的时间序列计算出，并证明这些特征是线性可分的，即存在一个超平面，可以将与连接节点配对的特征群与与未连接配对的特征群分开。这使得这些特征适合训练各种分类器来执行因果推断。特别地，我们使用这些特征来训练卷积神经网络(CNNs)。由此得到的因果推断机制在样本复杂度方面优于最先进的同类推断机制。训练的CNNs在结构上不同的网络中具有很好的泛化性。",
