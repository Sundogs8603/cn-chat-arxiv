    "translated_abstract": "人类生态成功依赖于我们的独特能力，即灵活自组织成合作社会群体，其中最成功的群体采用了大量的专业化和分工。与大多数其他动物不同，人类通过一生的试错中学习自己要扮演的角色。然而，当某些关键角色比其他角色更具吸引力，并且个体是自利的时，就会出现社会困境：每个个体都希望其他人扮演关键但无报酬的角色，这样他们可以自由选择一个报酬更高的角色。但是，如果每个人都这样行事，且一个关键角色缺乏填补，就会发生灾难。在这种情况下，学习最佳角色分配可能是不可能的。因此，一个基本问题是：如何在一群以自利为导向的终身学习个体中形成分工呢？在这里，我们展示了通过引入社会规范模型（我们将其视为分散社会制裁的出现模式）可以解决这个问题。",
