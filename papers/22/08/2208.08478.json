    "translated_abstract": "在人类神经科学中，机器学习可以帮助揭示与受试者行为相关的低维神经表示。然而，最先进的模型通常需要大量的训练数据，因此容易在人类神经影像数据上过拟合，这些数据往往具有较少的样本但很多输入维度。在这里，我们利用了一个事实，即我们在人类神经科学中寻求的特征恰好与受试者行为相关。因此，我们开发了一种通过分类器增强的任务相关自编码器（TRACE），并将其与标准自编码器、变分自编码器和主成分分析进行了比较，对两个严重缩减的机器学习数据集提取了行为相关的、可分离的表示。然后，我们在59名观察动物和物体的受试者的fMRI数据上评估了所有模型。TRACE几乎在所有模型中表现出色，显示出高达12%的分类准确率提升和高达56%的发现改善。",
