    "translated_abstract": "当前的基于会话的推荐系统（SBRSs）主要关注于最大化推荐准确度，而很少有研究专门致力于在准确度之外提高多样性。同时，不清楚以准确度为导向的SBRS在多样性方面的表现如何。此外，在文献中越来越多地质疑“准确度”与“多样性”之间的“权衡”关系。针对上述问题，我们进行了一项全面的研究，特别是考察具有代表性的基于会话的推荐系统在准确度和多样性方面的推荐性能，努力更好地理解SBRS的多样性相关问题，并提供设计多样化SBRS的指导。特别地，为了进行公平和全面的比较，我们精心选择了最先进的非神经，深度神经和多样化SBRS，通过覆盖更多具有适当实验设置的场景，例如代表性数据集，评估指标和超参数优化技术。",
