Our approach can identify distributional policy effects, particularly effects on inequality, under a type of difference-in-differences assumption. We provide asymptotic properties of our estimators and an inferential method. We apply the model to evaluate the effect of the minimum wage policy on earnings between 1967 and 1980 in the United States. Our results suggest that the minimum wage policy has a significant negative impact on the between-inequality but little effect on the within-inequality.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了使用交互固定效应的分位数回归来估计群体层面政策的异质性效应。我们的方法可以确定分布政策的效应，特别是对不平等性的影响，基于一种差异法的假设。我们提供了我们估计器的渐近性质和一种推断方法。我们应用该模型来评估美国1967年至1980年之间最低工资政策对收入的影响。我们的结果表明，最低工资政策对不平等性造成了显著的负面影响，但对内在不平等性的影响较小。",
