    "abstract": "Optical sensors can capture dynamic environments and derive depth information in near real-time. The quality of these digital reconstructions is determined by factors like illumination, surface and texture conditions, sensing speed and other sensor characteristics as well as the sensor-object relations. Improvements can be obtained by using dynamically collected data from multiple sensors. However, matching the data from multiple sensors requires a shared world coordinate system. We present a concept for transferring multi-sensor data into a commonly referenced world coordinate system: the earth's magnetic field. The steady presence of our planetary magnetic field provides a reliable world coordinate system, which can serve as a reference for a position-defined reconstruction of dynamic environments. Our approach is evaluated using magnetic field sensors of the ZED 2 stereo camera from Stereolabs, which provides orientation relative to the North Pole similar to a compass. With the help",
