    "abstract": "Recently proposed BERT-based evaluation metrics for text generation perform well on standard benchmarks but are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, e.g., relating to information correctness. We argue that this stems (in part) from the fact that they are models of semantic similarity. In contrast, we develop evaluation metrics based on Natural Language Inference (NLI), which we deem a more appropriate modeling. We design a preference-based adversarial attack framework and show that our NLI based metrics are much more robust to the attacks than the recent BERT-based metrics. On standard benchmarks, our NLI based metrics outperform existing summarization metrics, but perform below SOTA MT metrics. However, when combining existing metrics with our NLI metrics, we obtain both higher adversarial robustness (15%-30%) and higher quality metrics as measured on standard benchmarks (+5% to 30%).",

    "translated_abstract": "最近被提出的基于BERT的文本生成评估指标在标准基准测试中表现良好，但易受到对信息正确性的攻击。我们认为这部分原因是此类模型是基于语义相似性建模的。相反，我们提出一种基于自然语言推理（NLI）的鲁棒性评估指标，这种指标更适合建模。我们设计了一种基于偏好的对抗性攻击框架，并表明我们的NLI基础指标比最近的BERT基础指标更具鲁棒性。在标准基准测试中，我们的NLI基础指标优于现有的摘要评估指标，但低于SOTA MT指标。然而，在现有指标与我们的NLI指标相结合时，我们既获得了更高的对抗鲁棒性（15％-30％），又获得了标准基准测试中更高的质量指标（+5％至30％）。",
