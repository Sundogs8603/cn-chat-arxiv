    "abstract": "Many ontologies, i.e., Description Logic (DL) knowledge bases, have been developed to provide rich knowledge about various domains, and a lot of them are based on ALC, i.e., a prototypical and expressive DL, or its extensions. The main task that explores ALC ontologies is to compute semantic entailment. We developed FALCON, a Fuzzy ALC Ontology Neural reasoner, which uses fuzzy logic operators to generate model structures for arbitrary ALC ontologies, and uses multiple model structures to compute faithful semantic entailments. Theoretical results show that FALCON faithfully approximates semantic entailment over ALC ontologies and therefore endows neural networks with world models and the ability to reason over them. Experimental results show that FALCON enables approximate reasoning, paraconsistent reasoning (reasoning with inconsistencies), and improves machine learning in the biomedical domain by incorporating knowledge expressed in ALC.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多本体，即描述逻辑（DL）知识库，已经被开发出来提供关于各种领域的丰富知识，并且其中很多基于ALC，即原型和表达力强的DL，或其扩展。探索ALC本体的主要任务是计算语义蕴涵。我们开发了FALCON，一个模糊的ALC本体神经推理器，它使用模糊逻辑运算符为任意ALC本体生成模型结构，并使用多个模型结构计算忠实的语义蕴涵。理论结果表明，FALCON能够忠实地近似计算ALC本体上的语义蕴涵，从而赋予神经网络世界模型和对其进行推理的能力。实验结果表明，FALCON能够实现近似推理，辅助推理（处理不一致性推理），并通过整合以ALC表达的知识改进生物医学领域的机器学习。",
