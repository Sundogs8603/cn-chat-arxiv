    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文分析了机器学习中使用的一种常见损失函数，即log-cosh损失函数。已经发表了许多使用这种损失函数的论文，但迄今为止，文献中尚未提出过统计分析。本文介绍了log-cosh损失函数产生的分布函数。我们将其与类似的柯西分布进行比较，并进行多种表征其特性的统计程序。特别地，我们检验了与其相关的概率密度函数、累积分布函数、似然函数和费舍尔信息。我们将柯西和Cosh分布以及MLE的位置参数的渐近偏差、渐近方差和置信区间进行并列考虑。我们还提供了来自其他几种损失函数的鲁棒估计器的比较，包括Huber损失函数和秩分散函数。此外，我们还研究了该损失函数的应用。",
