    "translated_abstract": "个人理性选择的一个基本原则是森的 γ公理，也称为扩展一致性，它规定两个菜单中选择的任何一个替代品必须从菜单的并集中选择。扩展一致性也可以在社会选择的环境中规定。在投票理论中，它规定从两个候选人中选择的任何候选人必须从候选人的联合领域中选择。该公理的一个重要特例是二元扩展一致性，它规定从最初的候选人领域中选择的任何候选人，在与新候选人进行头对头比赛时也必须被选择，当将新的候选人添加到领域时更新选择，从而排除破坏者效应。本文研究了扩展一致性的弱化和决议弱化之间的紧张关系，决议强调在任何选举中选择单一候选人的原则。众所周知，在许多投票系统中，包括排序对投票和舒尔采方法，决议与基本公平条件不一致。我们证明了不可能定理，在二元扩展一致性的弱化与(弱)决议的几个变体之间不相容，包括允许选民只表达弱偏好或允许平局的变体。我们的结果突显了设计符合多个合理标准的投票规则面临的困难，并且对扩展一致性和决议之间的权衡关系提供了新的见解。",
