    "translated_abstract": "作为一种有效的用于图数据的神经网络模型，图神经网络最近在各种无线优化问题中得到成功应用。鉴于GNN的推理阶段可以自然地实现分散式，因此GNN是次世代无线通信的分散式控制/管理的潜在推手。然而，在GNN的分散推理中，由于邻居之间的信息交换，可能导致隐私泄露。为了解决这个问题，本文分析并增强了无线网络中基于GNN的分散推理的隐私。具体而言，我们采用本地差分隐私作为度量标准，并设计了新的保护隐私的信号以及保证隐私的训练算法来实现保护隐私的推理。我们还定义了SNR-隐私权衡函数，以分析在无线网络中采用GNN的分散推理的性能上限。为了进一步增强透明度，我们通过广泛的模拟展示了基于GNN的隐私保护通信和推理过程。",
