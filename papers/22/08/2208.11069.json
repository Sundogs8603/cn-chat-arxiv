In this paper, we investigate the requirements and properties of the asynchronous task execution of machine learning (ML)-driven high performance computing (HPC) workflows. We model the degree of asynchronicity permitted for arbitrary workflows and propose key metrics that can be used to determine qualitative benefits when employing asynchronous execution. Our experiments represent relevant scientific drivers, we perform them at scale on Summit, and we show that the performance enhancements due to asynchronous execution are consistent with our model.",

    "translated_abstract": "异构科学工作流由许多类型的任务组成，这些任务需要在异构资源上执行。异步执行这些任务对于提高资源利用率、任务吞吐量和减少工作流的时间非常重要。因此，能够在异构资源上调度和执行不同类型任务的中间件必须支持异步执行任务。本文研究了机器学习驱动的高性能计算工作流的异步任务执行的要求和特性。我们模型化了任意工作流的异步性程度，并提出了可用于确定异步执行带来的定性收益的关键指标。我们的实验代表了相关科学驱动，我们在Summit上进行了大规模实验，并且我们展示了由于异步执行所带来的性能增强与我们的模型一致。",
