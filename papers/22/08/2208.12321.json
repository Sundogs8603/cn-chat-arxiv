    "abstract": "This paper examines the interplay between desegregation, institutional bias, and individual behavior in education. Using a game-theoretic model that considers race-heterogeneous social incentives, the study investigates the effects of between-school desegregation on within-school disparities in coursework. The analysis incorporates a segregation measure based on entropy and proposes an optimization-based approach to evaluate the impact of student reassignment policies. The results highlight that Black and Hispanic students in predominantly White schools, despite receiving less encouragement to apply to college, exhibit higher enrollment in college-prep coursework due to stronger social incentives from their classmates' coursework decisions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了种族融合、制度偏见和个体行为在教育中的相互作用。使用考虑到种族异质性社会激励的博弈论模型，研究调查了学校间融合对学校内课程差异的影响。分析结合了一种基于熵的隔离度测量，并提出了一种基于优化的方法来评估学生重新分配政策的影响。结果表明，在主要为白人学生的学校中，尽管黑人和西班牙裔学生未受到较少上大学鼓励，但由于同学选课决策的更强社会激励，他们在大学预备课程中的入学率更高。",
