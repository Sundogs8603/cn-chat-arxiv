    "translated_abstract": "在众多科学和工程领域中，大规模动态系统的模拟至关重要。然而，传统的数值求解器在估计积分时由于步长选择的限制，存在着精度和计算效率之间的权衡。为了解决这个挑战，我们引入了一种基于深度学习的修正器，称为NeurVec，它可以补偿集成误差并在模拟中实现更大的时间步长。我们在各种复杂动态系统基准上进行了大量实验证明，即使在使用有限和离散数据进行训练时，NeurVec在连续相空间上表现出了显著的泛化能力。NeurVec显著加速了传统求解器，实现了几十到几百倍的速度提升，同时保持了高水平的准确性和稳定性。此外，NeurVec的简单而有效的设计结合了易于实现的特点，有潜力建立起一个新的求解器范式。",
