    "abstract": "Existing techniques for image-to-image translation commonly have suffered from two critical problems: heavy reliance on per-sample domain annotation and/or inability of handling multiple attributes per image. Recent truly-unsupervised methods adopt clustering approaches to easily provide per-sample one-hot domain labels. However, they cannot account for the real-world setting: one sample may have multiple attributes. In addition, the semantics of the clusters are not easily coupled to the human understanding. To overcome these, we present a LANguage-driven Image-to-image Translation model, dubbed LANIT. We leverage easy-to-obtain candidate attributes given in texts for a dataset: the similarity between images and attributes indicates per-sample domain labels. This formulation naturally enables multi-hot label so that users can specify the target domain with a set of attributes in language. To account for the case that the initial prompts are inaccurate, we also present prompt learning.",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的图像转换技术通常存在两个关键问题：对每个样本域注释的强依赖性和/或无法处理每个图像的多个属性。最近的真正无监督方法采用了聚类方法，以轻松提供每个样本的单热域标签。然而，它们无法考虑到真实世界的情况：一个样本可能具有多个属性。此外，簇的语义与人类理解不容易耦合。为了克服这些问题，我们提出了一种名为基于语言的LANguage-driven Image-to-image Translation（LANIT）模型。我们利用在数据集中提供的易于获得的文本候选属性：图像和属性之间的相似性指示每个样本的域标签。这种形式自然地启用了多热标签，以便用户可以用语言指定带有属性集的目标域。为了应对最初提示不准确的情况，我们还提出了提示学习。",

Meanwhile, the prompt learning mechanism can deal with the situation where the initial prompt is inaccurate."
