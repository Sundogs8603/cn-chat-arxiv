    "abstract": "While uniform sampling has been widely studied in the matrix completion literature, CUR sampling approximates a low-rank matrix via row and column samples. Unfortunately, both sampling models lack flexibility for various circumstances in real-world applications. In this work, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement sampling strategy, coined Cross-Concentrated Sampling (CCS). By bridging uniform sampling and CUR sampling, CCS provides extra flexibility that can potentially save sampling costs in applications. In addition, we also provide a sufficient condition for CCS-based matrix completion. Moreover, we propose a highly efficient non-convex algorithm, termed Iterative CUR Completion (ICURC), for the proposed CCS model. Numerical experiments verify the empirical advantages of CCS and ICURC against uniform sampling and its baseline algorithms, on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "在矩阵补全领域，虽然均匀采样得到了广泛关注，但CUR采样通过行和列样本逼近低秩矩阵。不幸的是，在真实世界的应用中，这两种采样模型都缺乏灵活性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖且易于实现的采样策略，称为跨度集中采样（CCS）。通过连接均匀采样和CUR采样，CCS提供了额外的灵活性，有可能在应用中节省采样成本。此外，我们还提供了CCS型矩阵补全的充分条件。我们还提出了一种高效的非凸算法，称为迭代CUR补全（ICURC），用于所提出的CCS模型。数值实验验证了CCS和ICURC在合成和真实数据集上相对于均匀采样及其基线算法的实际优势。",
