    "translated_abstract": "许多图绘制算法将节点视为点，而图形可视化工具经常将它们表示为形状。这些形状支持显示标签或使用大小或颜色编码各种数据。然而，它们会产生节点之间的重叠，这会通过隐藏部分信息来阻碍探索过程。因此，消除这些重叠以提高图形可视化的可读性非常重要。本研究提出了一种新颖的算法，将重叠移除看作是一个联合应力和缩放优化问题，并利用高效的随机梯度下降。该方法与现有算法进行比较，多个质量度量证明了它快速移除重叠的有效性，同时保持了图形布局的拓扑信息。",
    "tldr": "FORBID提出了一种基于随机梯度下降的算法，用于解决图形可视化中因节点形状而引起的重叠问题，该算法能在维持节点拓扑信息的同时，高效地移除重叠。"
