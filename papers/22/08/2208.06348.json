    "translated_abstract": "脑信号（如脑电图）和人类语言在许多下游任务中被广泛研究，但二者之间的联系尚未得到很好的探索。本研究探讨了脑电图和语言之间的关系和依赖性。在表示层面上，我们引入了一种名为MTAM（Multimodal Transformer Alignment Model）的方法，用于观察这两种模态之间的协调表示。我们使用了多种关系对齐技术，如典型相关分析和Wasserstein距离，作为损失函数来转换特征。在情感分析和关系检测等下游应用中，我们在ZuCo和K-EmoCon两个数据集上实现了新的最先进结果。我们的方法在情感分析方面使K-EmoCon数据集的F1分数提高了1.7％，ZuCo数据集提高了9.3％，在关系检测方面ZuCo数据集提高了7.4％。此外，我们提供了国际上最大的人类类比推理数据集的编码方案。",
