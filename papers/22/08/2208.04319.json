    "translated_abstract": "解决偏微分方程（PDE）是物理、生物和化学领域重要的研究手段，近年来，PINN作为数值方法的一种近似替代品，受到了广泛的关注并在许多领域中发挥了重要的作用。然而，PINN用全连接网络作为其模型，其拟合能力和时间空间外推能力有限。在本文中，我们基于图神经网络提出了PhyGNNet用于解决偏微分方程，该网络由编码器、处理器和解码器块组成。特别的，我们将计算区域划分为规则的网格，定义在网格上的偏微分算子，然后构造网络的偏微分损失以优化构建PhyGNNet模型。此外，我们在Burgers方程和热方程上进行比较实验以验证我们的方法，结果表明我们的方法在时间和空间范围内拥有更好的拟合能力和外推能力。",
