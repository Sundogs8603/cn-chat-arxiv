    "translated_abstract": "变分量子算法在噪声中间规模量子（NISQ）时代展示了巨大的潜力。在变分量子算法的工作流程中，通过迭代更新自变量来逼近期望的量子态。在设计更好的自变量方面，我们已经看到了各种努力，以减少门数量。有些方法考虑了底层电路的物理意义，而另一些方法则采用神经架构搜索（NAS）的思想来生成自变量。然而，这些设计没有充分利用变分量子算法的优势，因为大多数技术都针对门自变量，并且参数通常是门的旋转角度。在量子计算机中，门自变量最终将转换为控制信号，例如超导量子比特上的微波脉冲。这些控制脉冲需要精确校准以最小化诸如过旋转和欠旋转之类的误差。在变分量子算法的情况下，这个过程会引入冗余，但变分量子算法的可变性质可以用来更好地优化脉冲序列。",
