    "translated_abstract": "尽管基于反向传播算法的深度神经网络已被广泛采用，但BP算法的生物不可行性可能会限制新DNN模型的演进。为了找到一种生物学上可行的算法来取代BP，我们专注于生物大脑内在的自顶向下机制。虽然生物大脑中的自顶向下连接在高级认知功能中起着至关重要的作用，但它们在神经网络学习中的应用仍不清楚。本研究提出了一个旨在通过使用自顶向下信用分配网络（TDCA-network）来训练自下而上网络的两层训练框架。TDCA-network充当了常规损失函数和反向传播算法的替代品，后者在神经网络训练中被广泛使用。我们进一步引入了一种类似于大脑的信用扩散机制，大大减少了TDCA网络的参数复杂性，从而极大地加速了",
