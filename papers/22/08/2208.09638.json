    "abstract": "What is the purpose of pre-analysis plans, and how should they be designed? We propose a principal-agent model where a decision-maker relies on selective but truthful reports by an analyst. The analyst has data access, and non-aligned objectives. In this model, the implementation of statistical decision rules (tests, estimators) requires an incentive-compatible mechanism. We first characterize which decision rules can be implemented. We then characterize optimal statistical decision rules subject to implementability. We show that implementation requires pre-analysis plans. Focussing specifically on hypothesis tests, we show that optimal rejection rules pre-register a valid test for the case when all data is reported, and make worst-case assumptions about unreported data. Optimal tests can be found as a solution to a linear-programming problem.",

    "translated_abstract": "什么是先分析计划的目的，应该如何设计？我们提出了一个委托-代理模型，其中决策者依赖于分析师选择性但真实的报告。分析师具有数据访问权，且目标不一致。在这个模型中，实施统计决策规则（检验、估计量）需要一个激励兼容机制。我们首先描述了哪些决策规则可以被实施。然后描述了受限于可实施性的最优统计决策规则。我们表明实施需要先分析计划。重点放在假设检验上，我们表明最优拒绝规则预先注册了一个对于所有数据报告的有效检验，并对未报告的数据做最坏情况假设。最优检验可以通过线性规划问题的解来找到。",
