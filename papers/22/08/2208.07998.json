    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理领域的机器学习取得了快速发展，有可能改变人们对人类语言习得的争议。然而，当前人工学习者和人类的学习环境和偏好存在差异，这削弱了从学习模拟中获取的证据的影响力。例如，如今最有效的神经语言模型所训练的语言数据量大约是一个典型儿童可以获得的数据量的一千倍。为了增加计算模型学习结果的相关性，我们需要训练出没有显著优势于人类的模型学习者。如果一个合适的模型成功习得了某种目标语言知识，它可以提供概念证明，证明该目标在假设的人类学习场景中是可以学会的。可信的模型学习者将使我们能够进行实验性干预，从而进行关于学习环境变量的因果推断，并且能够对条件参数进行严谨的测试。",
