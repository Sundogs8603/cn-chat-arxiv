    "abstract": "Autonomous agents are able to draw on a wide variety of potential sources of task knowledge; however current approaches invariably focus on only one or two. Here we investigate the challenges and impact of exploiting diverse knowledge sources to learn online, in one-shot, new tasks for a simulated office mobile robot. The resulting agent, developed in the Soar cognitive architecture, uses the following sources of domain and task knowledge: interaction with the environment, task execution and search knowledge, human natural language instruction, and responses retrieved from a large language model (GPT-3). We explore the distinct contributions of these knowledge sources and evaluate the performance of different combinations in terms of learning correct task knowledge and human workload. Results show that an agent's online integration of diverse knowledge sources improves one-shot task learning overall, reducing human feedback needed for rapid and reliable task learning.",

    "translated_abstract": "自主代理能够利用广泛的任务知识潜在来源，但目前的方法通常只关注其中一个或两个。本文研究了利用多元知识源在线一-shot学习模拟办公室移动机器人新任务面临的挑战和影响。所得到的代理是基于Soar认知架构开发的，利用以下领域和任务知识的知识源：与环境的交互、任务执行和搜索知识、人类自然语言指令以及从大型语言模型（GPT-3）检索的响应。我们探讨了这些知识来源的独特贡献，并针对正确学习任务知识和减少人类工作负担的方案组合进行了性能评估。结果表明，代理对多元知识源进行的在线整合总体上提高了一-shot任务学习的水平，减少了不断的人类反馈，使任务学习更快速且可靠。",
