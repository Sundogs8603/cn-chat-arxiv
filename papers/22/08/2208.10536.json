    "translated_abstract": "我们进行了基于技能得分的确定性太阳能预测的第一项综合性元分析，筛选了谷歌学术上的1,447篇论文，并对320篇论文进行全文审阅以进行数据提取。建立了一个包含4,687个数据点的数据库，并运用多元自适应回归样条建模、部分依赖图和线性回归进行了分析。定量测量了十个因素对技能得分的边际影响。分析结果显示了数据库中变量之间的非线性和复杂交互作用。预测时间段对技能得分有中心影响并支配了其他因素的影响。因此，太阳能预测的分析应该针对每个时间段单独进行。气候区变量与技能得分具有显著的相关性。在输入方面，历史数据和时空信息非常有帮助。对于日内预测，天空和卫星图像最重要。对于日前预测，则是数值气象预测和本地实测值最重要。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study conducted a meta-analysis on solar forecasting and identified forecast horizon as the most important factor affecting skill score, suggesting that analysis should be done separately for different time periods. The study also found significant correlation between climate zone variables and skill score. Historical data and spatial temporal information were found to be highly helpful in solar forecasting, as well as sky and satellite images for intra-day forecasting, and numerical weather predictions and locally measured values for day-ahead forecasting."
