    "translated_abstract": "本地内在维度度量（LID）的概念是数据维度分析的一个重要进展，具有数据挖掘、机器学习和相似性搜索等领域的应用。现有的基于距离的LID估计器针对以欧几里德空间中向量表示的表格数据集进行了设计。本文讨论了这些估计器在考虑图嵌入和图距离的图结构化数据上的局限性，并提出了一种新的与LID相关的度量方法NC-LID，用于量化最短路径距离与节点自然社区之间的本地特性的区分能力。本文还展示了如何通过制定两种基于LID的节点2vec变种算法来设计LID感知的图嵌入算法，其中的超参数根据NC-LID的值进行调整。通过在大量真实世界的图上进行实证分析，我们发现NC-LID能够指示具有高连接性的节点。",
