    "abstract": "Default risk calculus plays a crucial role in portfolio optimization when the risky asset is under threat of bankruptcy. However, traditional stochastic control techniques are not applicable in this scenario, and additional assumptions are required to obtain the optimal solution in a before-and-after default context. We propose an alternative approach using forward integration, which allows to avoid one of the restrictive assumptions, the Jacod density hypothesis. We demonstrate that, in the case of logarithmic utility, the weaker intensity hypothesis is the appropriate condition for optimality. Furthermore, we establish the semimartingale decomposition of the risky asset in the filtration that is progressively enlarged to accommodate the default process, under the assumption of the existence of the optimal portfolio. This work aims to provide valueable insights for developing effective risk management strategies when facing default risk.",

    "translated_abstract": "在风险资产受到破产威胁时，违约风险计算在投资组合优化中起着至关重要的作用。然而，在这种情况下，传统的随机控制技术并不适用，需要额外的假设才能得到违约前后情景下的最优解。我们提出了一种使用前向积分的替代方法，可以避免一种限制性假设，即Jacod密度假设。我们证明，在对数效用的情况下，较弱的强度假设是最优性的适当条件。此外，我们在假定存在最优投资组合的情况下，建立了风险资产在筛选器中的半鞅分解，该筛选器将逐步扩大来适应违约过程。本研究旨在为应对违约风险的风险管理策略的制定提供有价值的见解。",
