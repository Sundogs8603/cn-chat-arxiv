    "abstract": "Event extraction for the clinical domain is an under-explored research area. The lack of training data along with the high volume of domain-specific terminologies with vague entity boundaries makes the task especially challenging. In this paper, we introduce DICE, a robust and data-efficient generative model for clinical event extraction. DICE frames event extraction as a conditional generation problem and introduces a contrastive learning objective to accurately decide the boundaries of biomedical mentions. DICE also trains an auxiliary mention identification task jointly with event extraction tasks to better identify entity mention boundaries, and further introduces special markers to incorporate identified entity mentions as trigger and argument candidates for their respective tasks. To benchmark clinical event extraction, we compose MACCROBAT-EE, the first clinical event extraction dataset with argument annotation, based on an existing clinical information extraction dataset MACCRO",

    "translated_abstract": "临床领域的事件抽取是一个未被充分研究的研究领域。缺乏训练数据，以及领域特定术语的数量众多和实体界限模糊，使得这项任务尤其具有挑战性。本文介绍了DICE，一种稳健、高效的临床事件抽取生成模型。DICE将事件抽取作为条件生成问题，并引入对比性学习目标，以准确确定生物医学提及的边界。DICE还联合训练辅助提及标识任务和事件抽取任务，以更好地确定实体提及边界，并进一步引入特殊的标记来作为触发器和参数候选项，以包含其各自的任务中的确定实体问题。为了对临床事件抽取进行基准测试，我们根据现有的临床信息提取数据集MACCRO，构建了第一个带有参数批注的临床事件抽取数据集MACCROBAT-EE。",
