To provide effective location-based recommendations, it's important to analyze users' historical behavior and preferences. In this study, we present a sophisticated location-aware recommendation system that uses Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to offer personalized location-based suggestions. Our model combines location information and user preferences to provide more relevant recommendations compared to models that predict the next POI in a sequence. Our experiments on two benchmark dataset show that our BERT-based model outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models. Moreover, we see the effectiveness of the proposed model for quality through additional experiments.",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐兴趣点（POI）是一项具有挑战性的任务，需要从基于位置的社交媒体平台中提取全面的位置数据。为了提供有效的基于位置的推荐，分析用户的历史行为和偏好是非常重要的。本研究提出了一种复杂的位置感知推荐系统，利用Transformers中的双向编码器表示（BERT）提供个性化的基于位置的建议。我们的模型将地理位置信息和用户偏好相结合，相比于预测序列中下一个POI的模型，提供更相关的推荐。在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，我们基于BERT的模型优于各种最先进的序列模型。此外，我们通过附加实验展示了所提出模型的有效性。",
