    "translated_abstract": "线性排序问题（LOP）常用于许多研究领域中，其目的在于对M个对象进行排序。虽然已经努力制定高效的LOP算法，但验证数据是否是可排序的，也就是LOP解是否具有有意义的解释，却得到了很少的关注。为了解决这个问题，我们采用概率角度，将成对比较的结果建模为具有公共参数的伯努利变量，并从观测数据中估计参数。由于所需枚举的蛮力方法具有O（M！）的禁止复杂性，因此我们重新构思了这个问题，并引入了一个推广Slater指数的Slater谱概念，然后设计了一个算法来找到谱，并具有O（M^3 2^M）的复杂度，对于中等大小的M而言是可管理的。此外，通过对算法进行了微小的修改，我们能够找到所有可排序性和排名的分解。",
