The CFMM systematically underperforms the rebalancing strategy, because it executes all trades at worse-than-market prices. The performance gap between the two strategies, \"loss-versus-rebalancing\" (LVR, pronounced \"lever\"), depends on the volatility of the underlying asset and the marginal liquidity of the CFMM bonding function.

    "translated_abstract": "我们从被动流动性提供者的角度考虑了常量函数市场制造者（CFMM）的市场微观结构。在Black-Scholes情境下，我们比较CFMM的表现与再平衡策略的表现，该策略在市场价格上复制CFMM的交易。由于CFMM以比市场价格更差的价格执行所有交易，因此CFMM系统地表现不佳。两种策略之间的绩效差异“损失与再平衡”（LVR，发音为“lever”）取决于基础资产的波动率和CFMM bonding函数的边际流动性。我们模型中的CFMM损失表达式与Uniswap v2 WETH-USDC对的实际损失相匹配。LVR为CFMM流动性提供者的投资决策的前后评估提供了可交易的见解，并且还可以指导CFMM协议的设计。",
