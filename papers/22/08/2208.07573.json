    "translated_abstract": "网络比较的两个样本假设检验面临许多重大挑战，包括：利用重复的网络观测和已知的节点注册，但不需要它们一起操作；放松强结构性假设；实现有限样本高阶精确度；处理不同的网络大小和稀疏程度；快速计算和内存节省；在多重检验中控制假阳性发现率（FDR）；以及在理论上对有限样本精确度和最小极值性的理解。在本文中，我们开发了一个全面的工具箱，其中包括一种新的主要方法及其变体，所有这些方法都伴随着强大的理论保证，以解决这些挑战。我们的方法在速度和准确度上优于现有工具，并被证明是功率优化的。我们的算法对于处理各种数据结构（单一或重复的网络观测；已知或未知的节点注册）非常友好和多功能。",
