    "translated_abstract": "尽管经过多年努力，量子机器学习领域仅能在某些做作的密码学启发数据集的经典数据情况下展示量子学习的优势。在本文中，我们讨论了寻找量子学习算法可以比任何经典学习算法更快学习的学习问题的挑战，并研究如何识别此类学习问题。具体而言，我们反思了与此问题相关的计算学习理论的主要概念，并讨论了定义上的微妙变化如何意味着概念上显着不同的任务，这些任务可能导致分离或完全无分离。此外，我们研究了现有的具有证明的量子加速的学习问题，以提炼出一组更通用和充分条件（即“检查清单”），以展示学习问题在经典和量子学习器之间的差异。这些检查清单旨在简化对学习问题的方法。",
