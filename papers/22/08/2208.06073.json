In this paper, we propose Multi-channel Equivariant Attention Network (MEAN) to co-design 1D sequences and 3D structures of CDRs. To be specific, MEAN formulates antibody design as a conditional graph translation problem by importing extra components including the target antigen and the light chain of the antibody. Then, MEAN resorts to E(3)-equivariant message passing along with a proposed attention mechanism to better capture the geometrical correlation between different components. Finally, it outputs both the 1D sequences and 3D structure via a multi-round progressive full-shot scheme, which enjoys more efficiency",

    "translated_abstract": "抗体设计对于治疗和生物研究具有价值。现有的基于深度学习的方法遇到了几个关键问题: 1) 对于互补决定区域(CDR)的生成存在不完整的上下文; 2)无法捕获输入结构的整个3D几何形状; 3)无法以自回归方式高效预测CDR序列。本文提出了多通道等变注意力网络(MEAN)，以共同设计CDR的1D序列和3D结构。明确地说，MEAN通过导入额外组件，包括目标抗原和抗体的轻链，将抗体设计公式化为条件图翻译问题。然后，MEAN采用E（3）-等变消息传递和提议的注意机制来更好地捕获不同组件之间的几何相关性。最后，它通过一个多轮逐渐完整的方案输出1D序列和3D结构，这样更加高效。",
