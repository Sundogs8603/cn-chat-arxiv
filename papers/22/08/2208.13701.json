    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了一种利用有限差分逼近统计泛函Gateaux导数的构造算法，重点研究了在因果推断中出现的泛函。我们研究了概率分布未知但需要从数据中进行估计的情况。这些估计分布引导了经验Gateaux导数，我们研究了经验、数值和解析Gateaux导数之间的关系。从干预均值（平均潜在结果）的案例入手，我们勾勒了有限差分和解析Gateaux导数之间的关系。然后，我们得出了关于扰动和平滑的数值逼近速率要求，以保持单步调整的统计优势，例如速率双重强健性。接下来，我们研究了更复杂的泛函，如动态治疗方案、无限时段Markov决策中策略优化的线性规划形式。",
