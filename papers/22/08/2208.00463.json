    "translated_abstract": "翻译质量评估（QE）是在没有参考的情况下预测机器翻译（MT）输出质量的任务。这个任务在机器翻译的实际应用中越来越受到关注。在本文中，我们首先提出了XLMRScore，它是通过XLM-RoBERTa（XLMR）模型计算的BERTScore的跨语言对应物。这个度量可以用作简单的无监督QE方法，但使用它会导致两个问题：一是导致意外高翻译分数的未翻译标记，二是在XLMRScore中应用贪婪匹配时源语言和假设语言之间不匹配错误的问题。为了减轻这些问题，我们建议使用未翻译的词替换为未知标记，并跨语言对齐预训练模型以更接近对齐的词。我们在WMT21 QE共享任务的四个低资源语言对上评估了所提出的方法。",
