    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱补全（KGC）旨在发现知识图谱中实体之间的缺失关系。大多数先前的KGC工作集中在通过简单的评分函数学习实体和关系的嵌入。然而，更高维度的嵌入空间通常需要更好的推理能力，这导致模型尺寸更大，限制了在现实世界问题（例如大规模的知识图谱或移动/边缘计算）中的适用性。本文提出了一种轻量级模块化的KGC解决方案，称为GreenKGC，来解决这个问题。GreenKGC包括三个模块：表示学习，特征修剪和决策学习，通过分类器和负采样提取判别性的知识图谱特征，并对缺失关系做出准确的预测。实验结果表明，在低维度下，GreenKGC可以在大多数数据集上胜过其他先进方法。此外，低维的GreenKGC可以实现竞争性甚至更好的性能。",
