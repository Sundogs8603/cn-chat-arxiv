    "abstract": "We study an axiomatic framework for anonymized risk sharing. In contrast to traditional risk sharing settings, our framework requires no information on preferences, identities, private operations and realized losses from the individual agents, and thereby it is useful for modeling risk sharing in decentralized systems. Four axioms natural in such a framework -- actuarial fairness, risk fairness, risk anonymity, and operational anonymity -- are put forward and discussed. We establish the remarkable fact that the four axioms characterizes the conditional mean risk sharing rule, revealing the unique and prominent role of this popular risk sharing rule among all others in relevant applications of anonymized risk sharing. Several other properties and their relations to the four axioms are studied, as well as their implications in rationalizing the design of some sharing mechanisms in practice.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了匿名风险分享的公理框架。与传统的风险分享设置不同，我们的框架不需要有关个体代理的偏好、身份、私人操作和已实现损失的任何信息，因此它对于建模去中心化系统的风险分享是有用的。我们提出和讨论了在这种框架下自然的四个公理——精算公平性、风险公平性、风险匿名性和操作匿名性。我们发现这四个公理特征化了条件平均风险分享规则，揭示了这种广泛使用的风险分享规则在相关的匿名风险分享应用中的独特而重要的地位。我们研究了几个其他性质及其与四个公理的关系，以及它们在合理化实践中某些分享机制的设计中的影响。",
