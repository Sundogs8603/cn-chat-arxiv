    "abstract": "We study the ability of different classes of voting rules to induce agents to report their preferences truthfully, if agents want to avoid regret. First, we show that regret-free truth-telling is equivalent to strategy-proofness among tops-only rules. Then, we focus on three important families of (non-tops-only) voting methods: maxmin, scoring, and Condorcet consistent ones. We prove positive and negative results for both neutral and anonymous versions of maxmin and scoring rules. In several instances we provide necessary and sufficient conditions. We also show that Condorcet consistent rules that satisfy a mild monotonicity requirement are not regret-free truth-telling. Successive elimination rules fail to be regret-free truth-telling despite not satisfying the monotonicity condition. Lastly, we provide two characterizations for the case of three alternatives and two agents.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了不同类别的投票规则在诱导代理人真实报告其偏好时的能力，如果代理人想要避免遗憾的话。首先，我们证明无遗憾的真实报告等价于仅对前几个规则的策略性。然后，我们着重研究了三个重要家族的非仅对前几个规则的投票方法：maxmin、评分和康多塞一致规则。我们对maxmin和评分规则的中性和匿名版本证明了正反两方面的结果。在几个实例中，我们提供了必要和充分的条件。我们还证明了满足一定单调性要求的康多塞一致规则并不是无遗憾的真实报告。尽管不满足单调性条件，但连续消除规则也无法做到无遗憾的真实报告。最后，我们为三个选项和两个代理人的情况提供了两种特征描述。",

It proves the equivalence between regret-free truth-telling and strategy-proofness among tops-only rules. The paper discusses and analyzes maxmin, scoring, and Condorcet consistent rules, providing both positive and negative results, necessary conditions, and examining the characteristics of Condorcet consistent rules and successive elimination rules."
