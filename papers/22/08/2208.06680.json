    "translated_abstract": "机器学习可能会产生差异化的预测结果，其中人群的子群（如按年龄，性别或其他敏感属性定义）会被系统性地处于不利地位。为了符合即将出台的法规，从业人员需要找出这种差异性结果。然而，先前的文献通常通过当敏感属性事先指定时的统计程序来检测差异。这限制了在现实世界中适用性，因为数据集通常是高维的，而且敏感属性可能是未知的。为此，我们提出了一个名为自动定位差异（ALD）的数据驱动框架，旨在定位机器学习中的差异。ALD满足业界的几个需求：ALD（1）适用于任意的机器学习分类器；（2）可适用于不同的差异定义（如统计平等或平等赔率）；（3）可以处理分类和连续预测问题。",
