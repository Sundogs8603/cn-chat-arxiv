    "translated_abstract": "双拍卖使得多个买家和卖家在去中心化的环境下进行商品交易，从而支撑许多在线市场的运作。在这些市场中，买家和卖家通过竞标来竞争，但往往不事先知道自己的评估价值。由于分配和定价是通过竞标进行的，参与者的盈利能力以及市场的可持续性在很大程度上取决于通过重复互动来学习各自评估价值。我们在买家和卖家双方的信息反馈上对双拍卖市场进行了研究。我们展示了基于置信界竞标和“平均定价”的有效价格发现在参与者之间。特别地，买家和卖家的综合评估价值（也称为社会遗憾）在T轮中的遗憾为$O(\\log(T)/\\Delta)$，其中$\\Delta$为最小价格差。此外，交换货物的买家和卖家在个体上达到了$O(\\sqrt{T})$的遗憾。",
