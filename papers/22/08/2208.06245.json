    "abstract": "The multi-armed bandit (MAB) model is one of the most classical models to study decision-making in an uncertain environment. In this model, a player chooses one of $K$ possible arms of a bandit machine to play at each time step, where the corresponding arm returns a random reward to the player, potentially from a specific unknown distribution. The target of the player is to collect as many rewards as possible during the process. Despite its simplicity, the MAB model offers an excellent playground for studying the trade-off between exploration versus exploitation and designing effective algorithms for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Although many asymptotically optimal algorithms have been established, the finite-time behaviors of the stochastic dynamics of the MAB model appear much more challenging to analyze, due to the intertwine between the decision-making and the rewards being collected.
