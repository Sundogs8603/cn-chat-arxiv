    "translated_abstract": "近年来，利用无人机（UAV）执行任务越来越受欢迎。为解决潜在的任务调度问题，基于深度强化学习（DRL）的方法显示出与传统启发式方法相比的显着优势，因为它们更少依赖手工制定的规则。然而，随着问题规模的不断扩大，它们的决策空间也会变得非常庞大，这会破坏计算效率。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个双层深度强化学习（DL-DRL）方法，基于一个分治框架（DCF），将多UAV的任务调度分解为任务分配和路径规划两个层次。特别地，在我们的上层DRL模型中设计了一个编码器-解码器结构化的策略网络，将任务分配给不同的UAV，并在我们的下层DRL模型中利用另一个基于注意力的策略网络为每个UAV构造路径，以最大化完成的任务数。",
