    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习 (FL) 框架由于在广泛的协作学习任务中的成功而越来越受欢迎，但也引起了某些安全问题。其中，拜占庭攻击的风险是特别关注的问题，这指的是恶意客户参与学习过程的可能性。因此，FL 中的一个关键目标是消除 Byzantine attacks 的潜在影响，确保最终模型是可信的。已经观察到，客户端的模型/更新之间的方差越大，隐藏 Byzantine attacks 的空间就越大。因此，通过使用动量，从而减少方差，可以削弱已知 Byzantine attacks 的力量。中心化剪裁 (CC) 框架进一步表明，上一次的动量项除了减少方差外，还可以作为一个参考点更好地消除 Byzantine attacks。在本文中，我们研究了在不同的恶意代理有不同目标时 CC 的脆弱性。我们提出了一种改进的剪裁算法称为多引用点剪裁 (MRPC)，以克服这种脆弱性。MRPC 框架有效地利用多个参考点来消除专门设计以绕过 CC 方法的 Byzantine attacks。实验结果表明，在各种类型的 Byzantine attacks 下，MRPC 显著优于最先进的 FL 方法。",
