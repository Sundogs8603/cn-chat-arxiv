    "translated_abstract": "尽管排名优化技术得到了发展，点对点损失仍然是点击率预测的主要方法。这可以归因于点对点损失的校准能力，因为预测可以被视为点击概率。实际上，CTR预测模型也通常通过排名能力进行评估。为了优化排名能力，可以采用排名损失（例如成对或列表损失），因为它们通常比点对点损失实现更好的排名。之前的研究尝试直接将两种损失组合起来以获得两种损失的益处，并观察到了改进的性能。然而，之前的研究打破了输出logit作为点击率的含义，这可能会导致次优解。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种方法，可以联合优化排名和校准能力（简称JRC）。JRC通过对输出logit值进行对比来提高排名能力。",
