    "translated_abstract": "本文展示了一个或许令人惊讶的不等式：加权平均iid极重尾（即无穷大均值）的 Pareto 损失在第一顺序随机优势意义下大于单一损失。此结果被进一步推广到 Pareto 风险, 并在负相关、凸转换、随机求和和权重，以及灾难事件触发的损失背景下进行探讨。通过风险交换市场中的均衡分析，我们讨论了这些结果的几个影响。首先，极重尾 Pareto 损失的多样化增加了组合风险，因此存在多样化惩罚。其次，拥有极重尾 Pareto 损失的参与者将不会在市场均衡中分享风险。第三，将承担 Pareto 损失的参与者的损失转移到没有任何损失的外部方，可以实现使每一方都受益的均衡。我们的实证研究表明，我们的新不等式可以在实际数据中被观察到。",

It further proves that diversifying extremely heavy-tailed Pareto losses will increase portfolio risks and lead to a diversification penalty. Moreover, the agents with Pareto losses will not share risks in market equilibrium. Finally, transferring losses from agents with Pareto losses to external parties without any losses may lead to a beneficial equilibrium for all parties involved."
