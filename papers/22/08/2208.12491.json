    "abstract": "Cross-modality image synthesis is an active research topic with multiple medical clinically relevant applications. Recently, methods allowing training with paired but misaligned data have started to emerge. However, no robust and well-performing methods applicable to a wide range of real world data sets exist. In this work, we propose a generic solution to the problem of cross-modality image synthesis with paired but non-aligned data by introducing new deformation equivariance encouraging loss functions. The method consists of joint training of an image synthesis network together with separate registration networks and allows adversarial training conditioned on the input even with misaligned data. The work lowers the bar for new clinical applications by allowing effortless training of cross-modality image synthesis networks for more difficult data sets.",

    "translated_abstract": "交叉模态图像合成是一个活跃的研究领域，具有多个医学临床相关应用。最近，出现了一些允许使用配对但不对齐数据进行训练的方法。然而，在广泛的真实世界数据集上不存在稳健且性能良好的方法。在本研究中，我们提出了一个通用的解决方案，用于解决使用配对但不对齐数据的交叉模态图像合成问题，通过引入新的变形等变鼓励损失函数。该方法由图像合成网络的联合训练以及单独的配准网络组成，并允许在非对齐数据条件下对输入进行对抗训练。该工作通过允许更难的数据集轻松训练交叉模态图像合成网络，降低了新的临床应用的门槛。",
