    "abstract": "Data imputation is an effective way to handle missing data, which is common in practical applications. In this study, we propose and test a novel data imputation process that achieve two important goals: (1) preserve the row-wise similarities among observations and column-wise contextual relationships among features in the feature matrix, and (2) tailor the imputation process to specific downstream label prediction task. The proposed imputation process uses Transformer network and graph structure learning to iteratively refine the contextual relationships among features and similarities among observations. Moreover, it uses a meta-learning framework to select features that are influential to the downstream prediction task of interest. We conduct experiments on real-world large data sets, and show that the proposed imputation process consistently improves imputation and label prediction performance over a variety of benchmark methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "数据插补是在实际应用中常见的处理缺失数据的有效方法。本研究提出并测试了一种新颖的数据插补过程，实现了两个重要目标：（1）保持特征矩阵中观测之间的行相似性和特征之间的列上下文关系，（2）将插补过程调整为特定的下游标签预测任务。所提出的插补过程使用Transformer神经网络和图结构学习来迭代地改进特征之间的上下文关系和观测之间的相似性。此外，它使用元学习框架来选择对下游感兴趣的预测任务有影响力的特征。我们在真实世界的大型数据集上进行实验证明，所提出的插补过程在各种基准方法上始终提高了插补和标签预测性能。",
