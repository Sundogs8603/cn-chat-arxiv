    "translated_abstract": "神经辐射场（NeRF）展示了从新颖的视角合成3D场景图像的惊人能力。然而，它们依赖于基于射线行进的专业体积渲染算法，这些算法与广泛部署的图形硬件的能力不匹配。本文介绍了一种基于纹理多边形的新型NeRF表示法，它可以使用标准渲染管线高效地合成新的图像。将NeRF表示为一组多边形，纹理表示二元不透明度和特征向量。使用z-缓冲器传统呈现多边形，可以在每个像素处获得特征的图像，这些特征由小型、视图相关的MLP在片段着色器中解释以生成最终的像素颜色。这种方法使得NeRF可以使用传统的多边形光栅化管线进行呈现，这提供了大规模的像素级并行性，在包括移动电话在内的各种计算平台上实现交互式帧速率。",
