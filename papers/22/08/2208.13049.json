    "translated_abstract": "视觉Transformer（ViT）在各种与视觉相关的任务中展示了最先进的性能。ViTs的成功激励了攻击者对其进行后门攻击。虽然传统的卷积神经网络（CNNs）对后门攻击的脆弱性是众所周知的，但ViTs的后门攻击很少被研究。与通过卷积捕捉像素级局部特征的CNNs相比，ViTs通过补丁和关注机制提取全局上下文信息。将CNN特定的后门攻击天真地移植到ViTs只能产生低干净数据准确性和低攻击成功率。在本文中，我们提出了一个隐秘而实用的ViT特定后门攻击TrojViT。TrojViT生成一个补丁级的触发器，旨在通过补丁显著性排序和关注目标损失，在DRAM存储器中的一些易受攻击位组成的ViT的参数上建立特洛伊木马。 TrojViT还使用最小化调整参数的方法。",
