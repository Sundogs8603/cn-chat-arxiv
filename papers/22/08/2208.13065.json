    "translated_abstract": "通常，系统操作员在开环预测优化过程中进行电力系统的经济运行：首先预测可再生能源(RES)的可用性和系统储备需求；根据这些预测，系统操作员解决诸如机组组合(UC)的优化模型，以确定相应的经济运行计划。然而，这种开环过程可能会实质性地损害操作经济性，因为它的预测器目光短浅地寻求改善即时的统计预测误差，而不是最终的操作成本。为此，本文提出了一个闭环预测优化框架，提供一种预测机组组合以改善操作经济性的方法。首先，利用双层混合整数规划模型针对最佳系统操作训练成本导向的预测器。上层基于其引起的操作成本来训练 RES 和储备预测器；下层则在给定预测的 RES 和储备的情况下，依据最佳操作原则求解 UC。这两个层级通过反馈环路进行交互性互动，直到收敛为止。在修改后的IEEE 24-bus系统上的数值实验表明，与三种最先进的 UC 基准线相比，所提出的框架具有高效性和有效性。",

The framework iteratively refines the predictors through feedback loops, achieving the optimal operation of unit commitment."
