    "abstract": "Online extremism has severe societal consequences, including normalizing hate speech, user radicalization, and increased social divisions. Various mitigation strategies have been explored to address these consequences. One such strategy uses positive interventions: controlled signals that add attention to the opinion ecosystem to boost certain opinions. To evaluate the effectiveness of positive interventions, we introduce the Opinion Market Model (OMM), a two-tier online opinion ecosystem model that considers both inter-opinion interactions and the role of positive interventions. The size of the opinion attention market is modeled in the first tier using the multivariate discrete-time Hawkes process; in the second tier, opinions cooperate and compete for market share, given limited attention using the market share attraction model. We demonstrate the convergence of our proposed estimation scheme on a synthetic dataset. Next, we test OMM on two learning tasks, applying to two real-world",

    "translated_abstract": "在线极端主义具有严重的社会后果，包括将仇恨言论合理化、用户的激进化以及社会分裂的加剧。已经探索了各种缓解策略来应对这些后果。其中一种策略使用积极干预：控制信号来增加对观点生态系统的关注，以提升某些观点。为了评估积极干预的有效性，我们引入了观点市场模型（OMM），这是一个考虑到观点间相互作用和积极干预作用的两层在线观点生态系统模型。观点的关注市场规模使用多元离散时间Hawkes过程在第一层进行建模；在第二层中，观点在有限的关注度下合作和竞争以获得市场份额，使用市场份额吸引模型。通过合成数据集展示了我们提出的估计方案的收敛性。接下来，我们在两个真实世界的学习任务上测试了OMM",
