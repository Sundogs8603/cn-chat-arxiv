    "translated_abstract": "半监督学习 (SSL) 在训练分类器时，通过在许多无标签图像上进行训练，承诺比在少量有标签数据集上训练时有更高的准确性。在实际应用中，例如医学成像，为了速度而收集未经筛选的无标签数据，因此可能与有标签集中的类别或特征不同。不幸的是，现代深度半监督学习在处理未经筛选的无标签数据时，常常会导致准确性下降。最近，一些较为复杂的方法通过检测分布外的无标签图像，然后丢弃或降低它们的权重来修复这个问题。与此不同，我们引入了 Fix-A-Step，一种更简单的过程，将所有未经筛选的无标签图像视为潜在有用的。我们的第一个洞见是，即使未经筛选的图像也可以产生有用的已标记数据增强。其次，我们修改了梯度下降更新的方式，以防止优化多任务 SSL 损失对有标签集准确性的损害。Fix-A-Step 可以修复许多常见的深度 SSL 方法，在 CIFAR 基准测试中提高了所有测试方法和数据集的准确性。此外，在医学成像数据集上进行评估时，Fix-A-Step 在处理未经筛选的无标签图像方面比现有的最先进方法要好得多。",
