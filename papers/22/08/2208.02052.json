    "abstract": "We employ Natural Language Processing techniques to analyse 377808 English song lyrics from the \"Two Million Song Database\" corpus, focusing on the expression of sexism across five decades (1960-2010) and the measurement of gender biases. Using a sexism classifier, we identify sexist lyrics at a larger scale than previous studies using small samples of manually annotated popular songs. Furthermore, we reveal gender biases by measuring associations in word embeddings learned on song lyrics. We find sexist content to increase across time, especially from male artists and for popular songs appearing in Billboard charts. Songs are also shown to contain different language biases depending on the gender of the performer, with male solo artist songs containing more and stronger biases. This is the first large scale analysis of this type, giving insights into language usage in such an influential part of popular culture.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们使用自然语言处理技术分析了“Two Million Song Database”语料库中377808首英文歌曲歌词，着重分析了五十年（1960-2010）间性别歧视的表达，以及对性别偏差的评测。通过使用一个性别歧视分类器，我们在较大的规模上识别了性别歧视歌词，远超前人用手动标注流行歌曲的小样本研究。此外，通过在歌曲歌词上学习的词嵌入来衡量关联，我们揭示了性别偏见。我们发现，尤其是由男性艺术家演唱的流行歌曲中的性别歧视内容在时间上呈逐渐增多的趋势。根据表演者的性别不同，歌曲还显示出不同的语言偏见，男性独唱艺术家的歌曲中包含更多和更强的偏见。这是第一次进行这种大规模的分析，为我们揭示了流行文化这一重要部分的语言用法。",
