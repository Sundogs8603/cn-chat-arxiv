    "translated_abstract": "在线二部图匹配是在线算法中的一个基本问题。目标是将两个顶点集合进行匹配，使得边权重的总和最大化，其中对于其中一个顶点集合，每个顶点及其对应的边权重按顺序出现在一个序列中。目前，在实际的推荐系统或搜索引擎中，权重是由用户的深度表示和物品的深度表示之间的内积决定的。标准的在线匹配需要付出$nd$的时间来线性扫描所有的$n$个物品，计算权重（假设每个表示向量长度为$d$），然后根据权重决定匹配。然而，在现实中，$n$可能非常大，比如在线电子商务平台。因此，改进计算权重的时间是一个具有实际意义的问题。在这项工作中，我们提供了计算近似权重的理论基础。我们展示了，通过我们提出的随机化数据结构，权重的计算时间可以达到次线性。",
