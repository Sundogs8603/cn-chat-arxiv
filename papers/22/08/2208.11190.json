    "translated_abstract": "顺序均衡是分析不完全信息多阶段博弈的传统方法，依赖于信念的相互一致性要求，这是一个在实证上不可行的假设。为了放宽相互一致性要求，我从理论和实验的角度探索了动态认知层次(DCH)解。DCH的一个特点是解在两个共享相同简化正常形式的不同博弈之间可以变化。为了测试这个预测，我进行了一个实验室实验，使用了两个战略等价的脏脸游戏版本。游戏参数根据DCH的预测进行校准，以最大化两个版本之间行为的预期差异。实验结果表明，两个版本之间的行为存在显著差异，并且更重要的是，观察到的差异与DCH一致。这表明在使用“策略方法”的简化正常形式进行动态博弈实验可能会导致扭曲。",
