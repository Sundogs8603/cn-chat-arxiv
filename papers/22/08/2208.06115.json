    "translated_abstract": "鉴于消费者在不同选择集合中作出选择的数据，开发描述和预测消费者选择行为的简洁模型是一个主要挑战。其中一种选择模型是边缘分布模型，该模型仅需要规定随机效用的边缘分布即可解释选项数据。在本文中，我们开发了一种精确的选择概率集合的特征化方法，该集合可以在任何集合中一致地通过边缘分布模型来描述。允许根据其效用的边缘分布将选择集合进行分组，我们展示了(a)验证这个模型与选择概率数据的一致性在多项式时间内是可能的，(b)最接近拟合的方法可以简化为解决混合整数凸规划问题。我们的结果表明，与多项式Logit模型和m相比，边缘分布模型提供了更好的表现能力。",
