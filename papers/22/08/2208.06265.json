    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统旨在帮助用户从庞大的目录中有效地检索感兴趣的物品。长期以来，研究人员一直致力于开发准确的推荐系统。然而，近年来，推荐系统面临越来越多的威胁，包括来自攻击、系统和用户产生的干扰以及系统的偏见。因此，仅仅关注准确性已经不够，研究必须考虑其他重要因素，如可信度。对于终端用户来说，一个值得信赖的推荐系统不仅要准确，而且还要透明、无偏见、公正，并且对干扰或攻击具有稳健性。这些观察实际上导致了推荐系统研究的范式转变: 从以准确性为导向的推荐系统转向了以可信度为导向的推荐系统。然而，研究人员缺乏对可信度推荐系统领域的文献的系统概述和讨论。因此，本文提供了可信度推荐系统的概述，包括对该新兴且快速发展领域的文献的讨论。",
