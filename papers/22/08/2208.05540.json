    "translated_abstract": "开发连接和自动驾驶车辆（CAVs）的安全性和有效性应用程序需要大量的测试和评估。在关键和危险的情况下运行这些系统的需求使得评估成本非常昂贵、可能存在危险，并且耗时较长。作为替代方案，研究人员试图使用仿真平台来研究和评估其算法和设计。对于与CAVs或其他车辆互动的驾驶员或人类操作者的行为建模是这种模拟的主要挑战之一。虽然为人类行为开发完美模型是一项具有挑战性的任务和一个开放问题，但我们在现有模拟器用于驾驶员行为的模型的基础上进行了显著的扩展。在本文中，我们提出了一个混合运输系统的仿真平台，包括人驾驶和自动驾驶车辆。此外，我们将人类驾驶任务进行分解，并提供了一种模块化的仿真方法。",
