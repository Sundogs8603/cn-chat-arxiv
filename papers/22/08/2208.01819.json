    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络所受到的节点注入攻击（Node injection attacks）近年来引起了人们的重视，因为这种攻击具有很高的攻击成功率，并能显著降低图神经网络的性能。但是，我们的研究表明，这些攻击在实际场景中经常失败，因为防御/检测方法可以轻松识别和删除被注入的节点。为了解决这个问题，我们致力于进行节点注入攻击的伪装，使被注入的节点看起来正常，并且对于防御/检测方法是不可感知的。然而，图数据的非欧几里德性质和缺乏直观先验知识为伪装的形式化、实现和评估带来了巨大的挑战。在本文中，我们首先提出并定义了伪装作为注入节点和正常节点的邻域网络之间的分布相似性。然后，针对实现，我们提出了一种针对节点注入攻击的对抗伪装框架，即CANA，以提高在实际场景下防御/检测方法的攻击性能。",
