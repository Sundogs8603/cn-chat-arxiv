    "abstract": "We prove a universal approximation theorem that allows to approximate continuous functionals of c\\`adl\\`ag (rough) paths uniformly in time and on compact sets of paths via linear functionals of their time-extended signature. Our main motivation to treat this question comes from signature-based models for finance that allow for the inclusion of jumps. Indeed, as an important application, we define a new class of universal signature models based on an augmented L\\'evy process, which we call L\\'evy-type signature models. They extend continuous signature models for asset prices as proposed e.g. by Arribas et al.(2020) in several directions, while still preserving universality and tractability properties. To analyze this, we first show that the signature process of a generic multivariate L\\'evy process is a polynomial process on the extended tensor algebra and then use this for pricing and hedging approaches within L\\'evy-type signature models.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们证明了一个通用逼近定理，可以通过时间和路径的紧凑集上的线性泛函逼近c\\`adl\\`ag（粗糙）路径的连续泛函。我们处理这个问题的主要动机来自于基于签名的金融模型，这些模型允许包含跳跃。实际上，作为一个重要的应用，我们定义了一类基于增广L\\'evy过程的通用签名模型，我们称之为L\\'evy型签名模型。它们在多个方向上扩展了资产价格的连续签名模型，如Arribas等人（2020）提出的模型，同时保留了通用性和可操作性的特性。为了分析这个问题，我们首先证明了一个通用多元L\\'evy过程的签名过程是一个扩展张量代数上的多项式过程，然后利用这一结果在L\\'evy型签名模型中进行定价和套期保值的方法。",
