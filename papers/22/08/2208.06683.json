    "translated_abstract": "近年来，对抗性系统设计问题推动了逆贝叶斯滤波器的发展。例如，最近提出了逆 Kalman 滤波器 (I-KF)，用于估计对手的 Kalman 滤波跟踪估计，从而预测对手的未来步骤。本论文及其伴随论文 (Part I) 的目的是通过提出逆扩展 Kalman 滤波器 (I-EKF) 来解决非线性系统中的逆过滤问题。伴随论文提出了 I-EKF (具有和不具有未知输入) 和 I-KF (具有未知输入) 的理论。在本文中，我们对高度非线性模型的该理论进行了拓展，该模型采用二阶、高斯和抖动前向 EKF。特别地，我们通过有界非线性方法推导了逆二阶 EKF 的理论稳定性保证。为了解决标准 I-EKF 的局限性，即系统模型和前向滤波器对防御者来说是完全已知的，我们提出了一种改进方案。",
