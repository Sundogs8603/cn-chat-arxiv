    "abstract": "Reliable estimates of volatility and correlation are fundamental in economics and finance for understanding the impact of macroeconomics events on the market and guiding future investments and policies. Dependence across financial returns is likely to be subject to sudden structural changes, especially in correspondence with major global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we are interested in capturing abrupt changes over time in the dependence across US industry stock portfolios, over a time horizon that covers the COVID-19 pandemic. The selected stocks give a comprehensive picture of the US stock market. To this end, we develop a Bayesian multivariate stochastic volatility model based on a time-varying sequence of graphs capturing the evolution of the dependence structure. The model builds on the Gaussian graphical models and the random change points literature. In particular, we treat the number, the position of change points, and the graphs as object of posterior ",

    "translated_abstract": "可靠的波动率和关联的估计对于经济和金融领域非常重要，可以用于理解宏观经济事件对市场的影响，指导未来的投资和政策。金融收益之间的相互依赖关系可能会受到突然的结构性变化的影响，特别是在像COVID-19这样的重大全球事件发生时。本文旨在捕捉在涵盖COVID-19疫情期间的时间范围内，美国行业股票投资组合之间相互依赖关系的突然变化。所选择的股票给出了美国股市的全面画面。为此，我们开发了一种基于捕捉依赖结构演变的时变图形序列的贝叶斯多元随机波动模型。该模型建立在高斯图形模型和随机变点文献的基础上。特别地，我们将变点的数量、位置和图形视为后验对象。",
