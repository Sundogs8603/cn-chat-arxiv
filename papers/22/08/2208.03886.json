    "abstract": "In this essay I will consider a sequence of questions. The first questions concern the biological function of intelligence in general, and cognitive prostheses of human intelligence in particular. These will lead into questions concerning human language, perhaps the most important cognitive prosthesis humanity has ever developed. While it is traditional to rhapsodize about the cognitive power encapsulated in human language, I will emphasize how horribly limited human language is -- and therefore how limited our cognitive abilities are, despite their being augmented with language. This will lead to questions of whether human mathematics, being ultimately formulated in terms of human language, is also deeply limited. I will then combine these questions to pose a partial, sort-of, sideways answer to the guiding concern of this essay: what we can ever discern about that we cannot even conceive?",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇文章中，我将考虑一系列问题。首先，这些问题涉及到智能的生物学功能，特别是人类智能的认知义肢。这将引出关于人类语言的问题，也许是人类迄今为止开发的最重要的认知义肢。虽然传统上对人类语言所包含的认知能力进行赞美，但我将强调人类语言多么有限，因此我们的认知能力也是有限的，尽管语言对其进行了增强。这将引出关于人类数学的问题，因为它最终是以人类语言的形式来表述的，所以也存在深层次的限制。然后，我将结合这些问题，对这篇文章的核心问题提出一个部分性的、有点侧面的答案：我们能够对我们甚至无法构想的事物有何了解？",
    "tldr": "这篇文章探讨了关于智能、人类语言和人类数学的问题，强调了人类语言的局限性，以及我们能否对我们无法想象的事物有任何了解。",
