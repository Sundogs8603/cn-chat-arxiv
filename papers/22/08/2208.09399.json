    "abstract": "The imputation of missing values represents a significant obstacle for many real-world data analysis pipelines. Here, we focus on time series data and put forward SSSD, an imputation model that relies on two emerging technologies, (conditional) diffusion models as state-of-the-art generative models and structured state space models as internal model architecture, which are particularly suited to capture long-term dependencies in time series data. We demonstrate that SSSD matches or even exceeds state-of-the-art probabilistic imputation and forecasting performance on a broad range of data sets and different missingness scenarios, including the challenging blackout-missing scenarios, where prior approaches failed to provide meaningful results.",

    "translated_abstract": "缺失值的插补对于许多现实世界的数据分析管道来说是一个重要的障碍。本文聚焦于时间序列数据，并提出了SSSD，这是一种依赖于两个新兴技术的插补模型，分别是（条件）扩散模型作为最先进的生成模型以及带约束的状态空间模型作为内部模型架构，其特别适用于捕捉时间序列数据中的长期依赖关系。我们证明，SSSD在各种数据集和不同的缺失情况下，包括挑战性的黑屏缺失情况下，均可达到或甚至超过最先进的概率插补和预测性能，而先前的方法则无法提供有意义的结果。",
