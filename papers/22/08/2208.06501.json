    "translated_abstract": "最近，对于时间性知识图谱问答（TKGQA）的兴趣逐渐增加。TKGQA需要时间推理技术来从时间知识库中提取相关信息。现有的TKGQA数据集只包含基于固定时间段的时间性问题，该时间段内的时间知识图谱（TKG）可以完全用于答案推理，允许TKGQA模型利用未来知识来回答基于过去事实的问题。然而，在现实场景中，鉴于到目前为止的知识，我们也希望TKGQA系统能够回答关于未来的问题。由于人们不断寻求未来的计划，构建能够回答这种预测性问题的TKGQA系统非常重要。然而，在先前的研究中，这一领域仍然未被探索。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的任务：预测性问题回答的时间知识图谱预测。",
