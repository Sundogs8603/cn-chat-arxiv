    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于贝叶斯模型的方法，用于比较多个算法在多个数据集上的表现。该模型基于Bradley-Terry模型，统计了一个算法在不同数据集上优于另一个算法的次数。与频率派方法（如Demsar（2006）的平均排名比较测试和Benavoli等人（2016）的多个配对Wilcoxon测试与p调整过程）相比，基于贝叶斯的Bradley-Terry模型（BBT）具有不同的特点。特别是，贝叶斯方法允许对算法进行更加细致的描述，而不仅仅声称差异具有或不具有统计显著性。贝叶斯方法还允许定义两个算法在实际目的下是否等效，或实际等效区域（ROPE）。与Benavoli等人（2017）提出的贝叶斯符号秩比较方法不同，我们的方法具有一些独特的特点。",
