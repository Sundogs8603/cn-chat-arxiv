    "translated_abstract": "元宇宙代表了我们对下一代互联网的期望，并带来了新的关键绩效指标（KPI） 。虽然传统的超可靠性和低时延通信（URLLC）可以满足客观的KPI，但很难提供个性化的沉浸式体验，这是元宇宙的独特特点。由于体验质量（QoE）可以被视为综合的KPI，因此URLLC被演变为具有个性化资源分配方案的下一代URLLC（xURLLC）来实现更高的QoE。为了部署元宇宙xURLLC服务，我们研究了元宇宙服务提供商（MSP）和网络基础设施提供商（InP）之间的交互，并提供了一个最优合同设计框架。具体而言，我们旨在最大化MSP的效用，该效用被定义为元宇宙用户QoE的函数，同时确保InP的激励。为了在数学上模拟QoE，我们提出了一个名为Meta-Immersion的新型度量标准。",
