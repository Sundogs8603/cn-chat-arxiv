    "translated_abstract": "多尺度特征已被证明对于目标检测非常有效，但往往需要巨大甚至是禁止性的额外计算成本，尤其是对于最近的基于Transformer的检测器。本文提出了一种迭代多尺度特征聚合（IMFA）的通用方法，以实现在基于Transformer的目标检测器中高效使用多尺度特征。其核心思想是利用来自仅有几个关键位置的稀疏多尺度特征，并通过两个新的设计实现。首先，IMFA重新排列Transformer编码器-解码器管道，以便根据检测预测迭代更新编码特征。其次，IMFA在以先前的检测预测作为指导的情况下，从仅有几个关键点采用稀疏的尺度自适应特征用于精细检测。因此，采样的多尺度特征是稀疏的，但对于目标检测仍然非常有益。大量实验证明，所提出的IMFA技术可以在保证目标检测性能的同时显著减少计算成本。",

The proposed method exploits sparse multi-scale features from just a few crucial locations, achieved by rearranging the Transformer encoder-decoder pipeline and sparsely sampling scale-adaptive features for refined detection. The extensive experiments show that the proposed IMFA technique can significantly reduce computation costs while maintaining the performance of object detection."
