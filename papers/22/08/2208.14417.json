    "translated_abstract": "标准化的数据集和基准已经在计算机视觉、自然语言处理、多模态和表格设置方面推动了创新。我们发现，与其他研究领域相比，欺诈检测面临着独特的挑战：高级别的不平衡、多样化的特征类型、频繁变化的欺诈模式和问题的对抗性。由于这些挑战，对其他研究领域的数据集评估的建模方法可能对欺诈检测效果不佳。在本文中，我们介绍了欺诈数据集基准（FDB），它是一个针对欺诈检测的公开可用数据集的汇编，涵盖了各种欺诈相关任务，包括识别无卡交易、检测机器人攻击、分类恶意URL、估计贷款违约风险和内容审核等。基于Python的FDB库提供了一致的API用于数据加载和标准化的训练和测试集划分。我们演示了几种应用场景。",
