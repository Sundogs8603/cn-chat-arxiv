    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一个用于服务异质需求的稳态拼车排队网络模型，并在此基础上优化拼车服务的设计。通过将研究区域划分为一组相对均匀的区域来解决空间异质性，并引入一组条件以避免乘客之间的明显绕行。然后，我们开发了一个广义的多区域排队网络模型，描述了车辆在每个区域内和相邻区域之间状态的转换，以及如何由闲置或部分占用的车辆为乘客提供服务。基于排队网络模型构建了一个大型方程系统，用于分析评估稳态系统性能。然后，我们制定了一个带约束的非线性规划问题，以优化拼车服务的设计，例如区域级车辆部署、车辆路径规划和车辆再平衡操作。一个定制的解决方案方法被提出来。",
