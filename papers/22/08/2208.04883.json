    "translated_abstract": "星际物体（ISOs）很可能是不可替代的原始材料，在理解系外行星星系方面具有重要价值。然而，由于其运行轨道难以约束，通常具有较高的倾角和相对速度，使用传统的人在环路方法探索ISOs具有相当大的挑战性。本文提出了一种名为神经会合的深度学习导航和控制框架，用于在实时中以可靠、准确和自主的方式遭遇快速移动的物体，包括ISOs。它在基于谱归一化的深度神经网络的引导策略之上使用点最小范数追踪控制，其中参数通过直接惩罚MPC状态轨迹跟踪误差的损失函数进行调优。我们展示了神经会合在预期的飞行器交付误差上提供了高概率指数上界，其证明利用了随机递增稳定性分析。",
