    "abstract": "Empathetic conversation is psychologically supposed to be the result of conscious alignment and interaction between the cognition and affection of empathy. However, existing empathetic dialogue models usually consider only the affective aspect or treat cognition and affection in isolation, which limits the capability of empathetic response generation. In this work, we propose the CASE model for empathetic dialogue generation. It first builds upon a commonsense cognition graph and an emotional concept graph and then aligns the user's cognition and affection at both the coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. Through automatic and manual evaluation, we demonstrate that CASE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines of empathetic dialogues and can generate more empathetic and informative responses.",

    "translated_abstract": "共情交流应该是共情认知和情感的有意识调整和交互的结果。然而，现有的共情对话模型通常只考虑情感方面或在认知和情感上单独处理，这限制了共情响应生成的能力。在本研究中，我们提出了用于共情对话生成的CASE模型。它首先建立在常识认知图和情感概念图的基础上，然后在粗细的两个层面上对用户的认知和情感进行匹配。通过自动和手动评估，我们证明CASE优于共情对话的最新基线，并且可以产生更具共情和信息性的响应。",
