    "translated_abstract": "在计算机视觉中，多标签识别是具有许多实际应用的重要任务，但是对先前未见标签进行分类仍然是一个重大挑战。本文提出了一种新颖的算法，Aligned Dual moDality ClaSsifier (ADDS)，其中包括了一个双模态解码器(DM-decoder)，用于开放词汇的多标签分类任务并对视觉和文本特征进行对齐。然后，我们设计了一种简单而有效的方法称为Pyramid-Forwarding，以提高对高分辨率输入的性能。此外，我们采用了选择性语言监督来进一步提升模型性能。在几个标准基准数据集NUS-WIDE、ImageNet-1k、ImageNet-21k和MS-COCO上进行了大量实验证明，我们的方法明显优于先前的方法，并为开放词汇的多标签分类、传统多标签分类和一种称为单标签分类的极端情况提供了最先进的性能。",
