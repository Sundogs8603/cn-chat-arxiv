    "translated_abstract": "在医疗保健领域，检测压力并使个人监控其心理健康和福祉是具有挑战性的。可穿戴技术的进步现在使连续的生理数据收集成为可能。这些数据可以通过心理生理分析提供有关心理健康和行为状态的洞察。然而，由于收集到的数据数量巨大，需要自动化分析来及时提供结果。机器学习已经显示在受控实验室环境中为健康应用提供生理数据的自动分类方面的功效。然而，无法控制的步态环境提供了额外的挑战，需要进一步建模来克服。本文从经验角度评估了使用机器学习分类器来检测压力的几种方法，这些方法使用自我报告压力注释记录的生理数据在步态环境中进行了记录。在SMILE数据集的一部分训练部分中，能够评估这些方法。",
