    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了使用神经跳跃ODE（NJ-ODE）框架的路径相关扩展来预测一般随机过程的问题。虽然NJ-ODE是第一个建立起针对不规则观测时间序列预测的收敛性保证的框架，但这些结果仅适用于来自具有完整观测的It\\^o扩散的数据，特别是所有坐标同时观测到的马尔可夫过程。在本研究中，我们通过利用签名变换的重构性质将这些结果推广到通用的、可能是非马尔可夫或不连续的随机过程，并通过实证研究支持了这些理论结果，在非马尔可夫数据的情况下，路径相关的NJ-ODE优于原始NJ-ODE框架。此外，我们还展示了PD-NJ-ODE可以成功应用于经典的随机滤波问题和限价订单簿（LOB）数据。",
