We consider the heterogeneous scenario where the quantity of data can be different for each user. In this scenario, the amount of noise injected into the histogram to obtain differential privacy is proportional to the maximum user contribution, which can be amplified by few outliers. One approach to circumvent this would be to bound (or limit) the contribution of each user to the histogram.

In this work, we propose algorithms to choose the best user contribution bound for histogram estimation under both bounded and unbounded domain settings.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在用户级差异隐私条件下的直方图估计问题，在这种情况下，目标是保护任何单个用户的所有条目的隐私。我们考虑了数据数量对每个用户可能不同的异构场景。在这种情况下，为了获得差异隐私，在直方图中注入的噪声量与最大用户贡献成比例，而这可能会被少数离群值放大。一种应对方法是限制每个用户对直方图的贡献（或限制）。然而，如果将用户限制在小的贡献上，将会丢弃大量数据。在这项工作中，我们提出了在有界和无界域设置下选择最佳用户贡献边界的算法。当域的大小有界时，我们提出了一种用户贡献边界策略，几乎可以在事后与最佳贡献边界达到两倍近似。",
