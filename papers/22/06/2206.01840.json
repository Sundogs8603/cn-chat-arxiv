    "abstract": "We estimate the causal effect of external debt on greenhouse gas emissions in a panel of 78 emerging market and developing economies over the 1990-2015 period. Unlike previous literature, we use external instruments to address the potential endogeneity in the relationship between external debt and greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, we use international liquidity shocks as instrumental variables for external debt. We find that dealing with the potential endogeneity problem brings about a positive and statistically significant effect of external debt on greenhouse gas emissions: a 1 percentage point (pp.) rise in external debt causes, on average, a 0.4% increase in greenhouse gas emissions. One possible mechanism of action could be that, as external debt increases, governments are less able to enforce environmental regulations because their main priority is to increase the tax base to pay increasing debt services or because they are captured by the private sector who owns that debt ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们在78个新兴市场和发展中国家的面板数据中估计了外债对温室气体排放的因果效应，时间跨度为1990年至2015年。与以往文献不同，我们使用外部工具变量来解决外债与温室气体排放之间的潜在内生性问题。具体而言，我们使用国际流动性冲击作为外债的工具变量。我们发现，处理潜在内生性问题带来了外债对温室气体排放的正面且显著影响：外债增加1个百分点（pp.），平均会导致温室气体排放增加0.4%。一个可能的作用机制是，随着外债的增加，政府难以执行环境法规，因为他们的主要优先事项是扩大税基以支付不断增加的债务服务，或者因为他们被持有债务的私营部门所控制。",
    "tldr": "外债对温室气体排放有正面且显著的影响，增加的外债会导致温室气体排放的增加。造成这种影响的可能机制之一是，政府由于增加的债务服务压力，无法有效执行环境法规，或被私营部门所控制。",
    "en_tdlr": "External debt has a positive and significant effect on greenhouse gas emissions. An increase in external debt leads to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. One possible mechanism for this effect is that governments, under pressure from increasing debt service, are unable to enforce environmental regulations effectively or are influenced by the private sector that holds the debt."
