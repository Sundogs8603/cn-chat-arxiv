    "abstract": "While a growing body of literature has been studying new Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that work on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs, little has been done on adapting classical GNNs to less-homophilic graphs. Although the ability to handle less-homophilic graphs is restricted, classical GNNs still stand out in several nice properties such as efficiency, simplicity, and explainability. In this work, we propose a novel graph restructuring method that can be integrated into any type of GNNs, including classical GNNs, to leverage the benefits of existing GNNs while alleviating their limitations. Our contribution is threefold: a) learning the weight of pseudo-eigenvectors for an adaptive spectral clustering that aligns well with known node labels, b) proposing a new density-aware homophilic metric that is robust to label imbalance, and c) reconstructing the adjacency matrix based on the result of adaptive spectral clustering to maximize the homophilic scores.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管越来越多的文献研究了适用于同质性和异质性图的新型图神经网络，但在将传统图神经网络适应于 less-homophilic 图方面做得很少。虽然传统图神经网络处理 less-homophilic 图的能力受到限制，但仍具有效率高、简单、可解释性好等多个优点。本文提出了一种新颖的图重构方法，可集成到任何类型的图神经网络中，包括传统图神经网络，以发挥现有图神经网络的优点同时减轻其局限性。我们的贡献有三个方面: a) 学习拟合节点标签的自适应谱聚类的 pseudo-eigenvector 权重，b) 提出一种新的密度感知的同质性度量方法，具有良好的标签不平衡性鲁棒性，c) 基于自适应谱聚类的结果重构邻接矩阵，以最大化同质性分数。",
