    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络(DNNs)对对抗性样本具有脆弱性。而且，对抗性样本具有传递性，这意味着一个DNN模型的对抗性样本可以以非平凡的概率欺骗另一个模型。这导致了基于传递的攻击，其中由替代模型生成的对抗性样本用于进行黑盒攻击。有一些研究致力于生成具有更好传递性的给定替代模型的对抗性样本。然而，训练一个特殊的替代模型以生成具有更好传递性的对抗性样本相对较少研究。本文提出了一种使用暗知识训练替代模型以增强替代模型生成的对抗性样本的传递性的方法。这个训练的替代模型被称为暗替代模型(DSM)。训练DSM的方法包括两个关键组成部分：提取暗知识的教师模型和混合扩增算法。",
