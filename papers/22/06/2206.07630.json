    "translated_abstract": "尽管最优输运问题最初被制定为线性规划，但添加熵正则化已被证明在许多应用中具有优越的计算和统计效果。Sinkhorn算法是解决这个正则化问题的最常用方法，并且已经有多次尝试通过使用如正则化参数退火、动量或加速度来减少其运行时间。本文的前提是Sinkhorn算法的初始化相对较少受到关注，可能是由于两种先入为主的观念:由于正则化的OT问题是凸问题，因此可能不值得设计良好的初始化，因为任何初始化都是可行的；其次，因为Sinkhorn算法的输出通常在端到端管道中展开，所以数据相关的初始化会对雅各比计算造成偏差。我们挑战这种传统智慧，并展示了数据相关的初始化可以提高Sinkhorn算法的性能，并适用于端到端学习。",
