    "translated_abstract": "我们提出并研究了一种新的多项式投票规则类别，用于一般的去中心化决策/共识系统，更具体地说，用于PoS（权益证明）协议。主要思想受到了彭罗斯平方根定律和最近的二次投票规则的启发，即区分选民的投票权和选民在系统中的份额（占总份额的比例）。我们证明，虽然选民份额形成了收敛于狄利克雷分布的鞅过程，但他们的投票权却是一个随时间衰减到零的超鞅过程。这防止了任何选民操控投票过程，从而增强了安全性。对于这两个极限结果，我们还提供了明确的收敛速度。当初始的总投票量（或权益）很大时，我们展示了分享稳定性（或缺乏稳定性）的相变现象，即相对于总份额的选民初始份额的变化。我们还研究了选民之间交易（投票/权益的交易）的情况。",
