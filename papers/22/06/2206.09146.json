    "translated_abstract": "随着高动态范围（HDR）摄影的普及和可访问性增加，对动态范围压缩的色调映射运算符（TMO）需求日益增加。本文开发了一个两步神经网络TMO，具有自校准和感知优化功能。第一阶段，我们首先将HDR图像分解成规范化拉普拉斯金字塔，然后使用两个轻量级深度神经网络（DNN），以规范化表示作为输入来估计相应LDR图像的拉普拉斯金字塔。我们通过最小化规范化拉普拉斯金字塔距离（NLPD）来优化色调映射网络，这是与人类对色调映射图像质量的判断相一致的感知度量。在第二阶段中，输入的HDR图像是自校准的，以计算出最终的LDR图像。我们将同一张HDR图像输入经过不同最大亮度重新调整比例后的学习色调映射网络中，来完成这一自校准过程。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a two-stage neural network-based tone mapping operator (TMO) that is self-calibrated and perceptually optimized for compressing high dynamic range (HDR) images to low dynamic range (LDR) images. The TMO uses a normalized Laplacian pyramid and two lightweight deep neural networks to estimate the corresponding LDR image's Laplacian pyramid. The network is optimized by minimizing the normalized Laplacian pyramid distance (NLPD), a perceptual metric that aligns with human judgments of tone-mapped image quality. The self-calibrated input HDR image is processed to compute the final LDR image, and the TMO achieves sensitive quality optimization through perceptual metrics."
