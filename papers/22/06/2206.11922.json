    "abstract": "In the last decade, several organizations have produced documents intended to standardize, in the normative sense, and promote guidance to our recent and rapid AI development. However, the full spectrum of ideas presented in these documents has not yet been analyzed, except for a few meta-analyses and critical reviews of the field. In this work, we seek to expand on the work done by past researchers and create a tool for better data visualization of the contents and nature of these documents, to understand whether there is consensus or similarity between the principles espoused by various institutions, which may inspire debates on future regulations. We also provide some preliminary thoughts and questions that could guide the continuity of the research through a critical analysis of the results acquired by our methodology into a sample size of 200 documents.",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年中，一些组织已经制定了文件，旨在规范和推动我们最近和快速发展的AI技术的指南。然而，除了一些领域的元分析和批判性评论外，这些文件中呈现的完整思想光谱尚未得到分析。在这项工作中，我们试图扩展过去研究人员所做的工作，创建一个更好的数据可视化工具，以了解各机构所倡导原则之间是否存在共识或相似之处，这可能会激发未来的法规辩论。我们还通过对200份文档样本的方法论结果进行批判性分析，提出了一些初步的想法和问题，以指导研究的连续性。",
