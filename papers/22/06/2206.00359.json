    "translated_abstract": "深度聚类近年来成为复杂数据聚类的一种有前景的技术。尽管有了相当大的进展，但以前的深度聚类工作大多只利用单层表示构建或学习最终的聚类，例如在最后一个全连接层上执行K-means聚类或将一些聚类损失与特定层相关联，忽视了联合利用多层表示以增强深度聚类性能的可能性。鉴于此，本文提出了一种通过集成（DeepCluE）的深度聚类方法，它通过利用深度神经网络中的多个层的力量来弥合深度聚类和集成聚类之间的差距。具体而言，我们利用具有权重共享的卷积神经网络作为骨干网络，该网络通过实例级对比学习（通过实例投影仪）和簇级对比学习（通过簇投影仪）进行训练",
