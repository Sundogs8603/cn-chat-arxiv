    "translated_abstract": "本文在一个双资产均衡模型中，理论研究了价格泡沫和崩溃过程的形成。推导了不同基于智能体的模型的平均均衡价格动态的存在的充分必要条件，其中代理人根据因子和投资交易策略进行区分。与实验结果一致，我们表明，具有正平均股息的资产（即，具有严格下降的基本价值）在均衡价格上显示出实验资产市场中典型的驼峰形泡沫。此外，当市场末期出现急剧的价格下跌时，引发了具有恒定基本价值的资产以及显示价格泡沫形状的其他资产的错误评估效应。",

The study shows that assets with positive dividends display a hump-shaped bubble at equilibrium prices. A misvaluation effect is also observed in assets with constant fundamental values, triggered by assets displaying a bubble shape with a sharp price decline at the end of the market."
