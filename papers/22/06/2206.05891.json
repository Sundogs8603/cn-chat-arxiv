Training with large batches on individual clients is proposed to address data heterogeneity in general, but their effectiveness under partial client participation is not clear.

    "translated_abstract": "相较于全客户端参与，部分客户端参与是联邦学习中更常见的场景，但是会加重一些挑战，例如数据异构性。在部分客户端参与的情况下缺少非活动客户端的更新，可能会导致模型聚合偏离基于全客户端参与的聚合。通常提出采用在个体客户端上使用大批量来进行训练以解决数据异构性，但其在部分客户端参与的情况下的有效性不明确。在考虑这些挑战的基础上，我们提出了一种新的针对部分客户端参与的联邦学习框架，称为FedAMD，其核心思想是锚定抽样，将部分参与者分为锚定组和矿工组。",
