    "translated_abstract": "皮肤癌是一个重大的公共卫生问题，计算机辅助诊断可降低这种常见疾病的负担。从图像中分割皮肤病变是实现这一目标的重要步骤。然而，天然和人为的伪影（例如，毛发和气泡）、内在因素（例如，病变形状和对比度）以及图像采集条件的变化使得皮肤病变分割成为具有挑战性的任务。最近，各种研究者探索了深度学习模型在皮肤病变分割中的适用性。本综述调查了177篇深度学习分割皮肤病变的研究论文。我们从输入数据（数据集、预处理和合成数据生成）、模型设计（架构、模块和损失）和评估方面（数据注释要求和分割性能）等多个方面对这些工作进行分析。我们从技术细节和临床相关性两个方面讨论这些维度，突出开放的挑战和未来的研究方向。",
