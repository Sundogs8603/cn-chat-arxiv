    "translated_abstract": "尽管人工神经网络（ANNs）已经有了相当大的进展，但它们的设计过程仍然以直觉、经验和反复试错为主。这个依赖于人类的过程往往耗时且容易出错。此外，这些模型通常仅考虑在训练环境下的情况，而没有考虑周围的环境。神经网络的持续适应性和自动化对于一些领域非常重要，在这些领域中模型在部署后的可访问性很有限（例如物联网设备、自动驾驶车辆等）。此外，即使是可访问的模型，在部署后也需要频繁维护以解决诸如概念/数据漂移等问题，这可能会很繁琐和限制性。通过利用和结合神经网络架构搜索（NAS）和持续学习（CL）的方法，可以开发更加稳健和适应性的智能体。本研究进行了第一次广泛的深入探讨此交叉研究的综述。",
