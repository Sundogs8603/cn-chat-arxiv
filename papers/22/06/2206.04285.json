    "translated_abstract": "双曲线图神经网络能够有效地捕捉图数据集的内在层次结构，成为强大的图神经网络选择。然而，它们在图层内纠缠着多个不一致的（陀螺）向量空间，这使它们在泛化和可扩展性方面受限。在本文中，我们将Poincare disk模型作为我们的搜索空间，将所有近似都应用于该磁盘上（就好像该磁盘是从原点派生出的切空间），从而摆脱了所有空间转换。这样的方法使我们能够提出一个双曲正规化层，并进一步将整个双曲线模型简化为欧几里得模型，后者是我们提出的双曲正规化层的级联结果。我们将我们提出的非线性双曲正规化应用于当前最先进的同质和多关系图网络。我们证明，我们的模型不仅利用了欧几里得网络的解释性和各种模型组件的高效执行的优势，而且还保留了双曲线网络模拟分层图结构的表现能力。",
