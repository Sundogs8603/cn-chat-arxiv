    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural networks are a powerful model class for a range of computer vision problems, but it is difficult to interpret the image filtering process they implement, given their sheer size. In this work, we introduce a method for extracting 'feature-preserving circuits' from deep CNNs, leveraging methods from saliency-based neural network pruning. These circuits are modular sub-functions, embedded within the network, containing only a subset of convolutional kernels relevant to a target feature. We compare the efficacy of 3 saliency-criteria for extracting these sparse circuits. Further, we show how 'sub-feature' circuits can be extracted, that preserve a feature's responses to particular images, dividing the feature into even sparser filtering processes. We also develop a tool for visualizing 'circuit diagrams', which render the entire image filtering process implemented by circuits in a parsable format.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度卷积神经网络是计算机视觉问题的强力模型类，但是由于网络规模庞大，难以解释它们实现的图像过滤过程。在这项工作中，我们引入了一种从深层CNN中提取“特征保留电路”的方法，利用基于显著性的神经网络修剪方法。这些电路是网络中的模块化子函数，仅包含与目标特征相关的部分卷积核。我们比较了三种基于显著性标准提取这些稀疏电路时的有效性。此外，我们展示了如何提取\"子特征\"电路，它们能保留特定图像对某个特征的反应，将该特征分成更稀疏的过滤过程。我们还开发了一种可视化“电路图”工具，以可解析的格式呈现电路实现的整个图像过滤过程。",
