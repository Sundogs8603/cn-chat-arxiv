However, their training/sampling complexity is notoriously high due to the highly complicated forward/reverse processes, so they are not suitable for resource-limited settings. To solving this problem, learning a simpler process is gathering much attention currently. We present an enhanced GAN-based denoising method, called SPI-GAN, using our proposed straight-path interpolation definition. To this end, we propose a GAN architecture i) denoising through the straight-path and ii) characterized by a continuous mapping neural network for imitating the denoising path. This approach drastically reduces the sampling time while achieving as high sampling quality and diversity as SGMs. As a result, SPI-GAN is one of the best-balanced models among the sampling quality, diversity, and time for CIFAR-10, and CelebA-HQ-256.",

    "translated_abstract": "基于分数的生成模型（SGMs）展示了最先进的采样质量和多样性。然而，它们的训练/采样复杂性由于高度复杂的前向/后向过程而极高，因此不适合资源有限的环境。为了解决这个问题，目前对学习更简单过程的关注度正逐渐增加。我们提出了一种增强的基于GAN的去噪方法，称为SPI-GAN，使用我们提出的直线路径插值定义。为此，我们提出了一种GAN架构，通过直线路径去噪，并且由连续映射神经网络表征，以模仿去噪路径。这种方法大大减少了采样时间，同时实现了与SGMs相同的高采样质量和多样性。因此，SPI-GAN是CIFAR-10和CelebA-HQ-256中采样质量、多样性和时间中最均衡的模型之一。",
