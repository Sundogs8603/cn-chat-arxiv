    "translated_abstract": "全局图的子图可能分布在多个设备上，由于隐私限制而只能本地访问，尽管子图之间可能存在链接。最近提出的子图联邦学习方法处理跨本地子图的缺失链接，同时在其上分布式地训练图神经网络。然而，它们忽视了全局图不同社区组成的子图之间的不可避免的异质性，因此导致本地GNN模型的不兼容知识的崩溃。为此，我们提出了一个新的子图联邦学习问题，即个性化子图联邦学习，它专注于联合改进相关的本地GNN，而不是学习单个全局模型，并提出了一个新颖的框架FEDerated Personalized sUBgraph learning (FED-PUB)来解决这个问题。由于服务器无法访问每个客户端中的子图，FED-PUB利用随机图作为输入，利用本地GNN的功能嵌入来利用子图之间的相关性，同时保护隐私。我们在公共数据集和真实数据集上进行了实验证明，FED-PUB在精度、通信效率和收敛速度方面都达到了最先进的水平。",
