    "abstract": "This paper shows that the bunching of wages at round numbers is partly driven by firm coarse wage-setting. Using data from over 200 million new hires in Brazil, I first establish that contracted salaries tend to cluster at round numbers. Then, I show that firms that tend to hire workers at round-numbered salaries are less sophisticated and have worse market outcomes. Next, I develop a wage-posting model in which optimization costs lead to the adoption of coarse rounded wages and provide evidence supporting two model predictions using two research designs. Finally, I examine some consequences of coarse wage-setting for relevant economic outcomes.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文显示出工资在整数上的聚集部分是由公司粗略的工资设定所驱动的。通过对巴西超过2亿新员工的数据进行分析，首先得出了合同工资倾向于集中在整数上的结论。然后，研究表明倾向于以整数工资雇佣工人的公司不够复杂且市场成果较差。接下来，本文提出了一种工资发布模型，在该模型中，由于优化成本的考虑，公司采用了粗略的整数工资，并通过两种研究设计提供了与模型预测相关的证据。最后，本文研究了粗略工资设定对相关经济结果的一些影响。",
