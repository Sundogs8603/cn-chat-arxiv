    "translated_abstract": "创新理论强调社交网络和团队在促进突破性发现方面的作用。如今，全球科学家和发明家数量比以往任何时候都多，并且彼此之间更加相互联系。然而，研究表明，尽管有更多人发现事物，并且有更多可以以新颖方式重新组合的思想，但是新创意越来越难以找到，这与重新组合增长理论相矛盾。在本文中，我们对这个明显的谜题进行了新的阐释。通过分析过去半个世纪内全球范围内2000万篇研究文章和400万项专利申请，我们首先记录了远程协作的兴起，强调了全球科学家和发明家之间日益增长的相互联系性。我们进一步表明，在所有领域、时期和团队规模中，相对于在现场工作的同事，远程团队的研究人员更不可能做出突破性的发现。通过创建一个数据集，可以使我们推断出",
