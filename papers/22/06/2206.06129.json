    "translated_abstract": "脉冲神经网络(SNNs)在各种智能场景中展现出出色的能力。大部分现有的SNNs训练方法是基于突触可塑性的概念;然而，现实的大脑学习也利用了神经元固有的非突触机制。生物神经元的脉冲阈值是一种关键的固有神经元特征，它在毫秒时间尺度上表现出丰富的动态性，并被提出作为促进神经信息处理的潜在机制。本研究开发了一种新的协同学习方法，同时训练SNNs中的突触权重和脉冲阈值。使用突触-阈值协同学习（STL-SNNs）训练的SNNs在各种静态和神经形态数据集上实现了显著的优异表现，远优于使用两个退化的单学习模型训练的SNNs。在训练过程中，协同学习方法优化了神经元阈值，为网络塑造了额外的动态调整度，并有效利用了神经元固有的非突触机制。",

The approach optimizes neural thresholds during training, providing the network with additional degrees of dynamic adjustment, resulting in significantly better performance on both static and neuromorphic datasets compared to SNNs trained with traditional single-learning models."
