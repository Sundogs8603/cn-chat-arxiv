    "translated_abstract": "从示范中学习的方法通常利用接近最佳示范来加快训练速度。相比之下，人类教师在示范任务时会偏离最佳示范，并通过给出最能消除目标歧义的示范来教学。类似地，人类学习者擅长实用地推断教师的意图，促进两个代理之间的交流。这些机制在少示范情景中至关重要，因为在这种情况下推断目标更困难。在本文中，我们通过利用示范的目标推断的贝叶斯模型（BGI）来实现教学和实用主义机制。我们展示了该模型在具有两个基于目标的强化学习的人工代理的多目标教师-学习者设置中的优势。我们表明，将BGI代理（教导者和实用学习者）相结合可以加快学习速度并减少目标的歧义。",

By combining pragmatic mechanisms and pedagogy mechanisms, and leveraging a Bayesian model for goal inference, the learning process can be accelerated and goal ambiguity can be reduced."
