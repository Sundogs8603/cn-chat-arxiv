    "translated_abstract": "行动成本的信息对于真实世界的人工智能规划应用至关重要。最近的方法不仅依赖于声明性行动模型，还使用黑盒外部行动成本估计器，通常从数据中学习，这些估计器在规划阶段应用。然而，这些估计器可能计算成本高昂，并且产生不确定的值。在本文中，我们提出了一种对行动成本进行广义化的确定性规划方法，该方法可以在多个估计器之间选择行动成本，以在计算时间与有界估计不确定性之间取得平衡。这样可以实现更丰富和更现实的问题表示。重要的是，它允许规划器限制规划的准确性，从而提高可靠性，同时减少不必要的计算负担，这对于处理大规模问题至关重要。我们引入了一种搜索算法，对$A^*$进行泛化，用于解决这样的规划问题，并提出了其他算法扩展。",
