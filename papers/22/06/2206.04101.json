    "translated_abstract": "算法公平性引起了机器学习社区越来越多的关注。文献中提出了各种定义，但它们之间的区别和联系尚未得到清晰的解决。本文回顾了和反思了机器学习文献中以前提出的各种公平概念，并试图将其与道德和政治哲学中的论点联系起来，特别是公正理论方面。我们还从动态的角度考虑公平性的问题，并进一步考虑当前预测和决策所引发的长期影响。在考虑到不同类型公平性所涉及的显性假设和预期结果的差异后，我们提出了一个流程图，它包括对数据生成过程、预测结果和引发影响的不同类型公平性调查的隐性假设和预期结果。本文展示了匹配使命（即希望实现哪种公平性）与公平性措施之间的重要性。",
