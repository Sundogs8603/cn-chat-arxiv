    "translated_abstract": "现代多层感知器（MLP）模型已经展现出在没有自我注意力的情况下学习视觉表示方面的竞争性结果，然而，现有的MLP模型并不擅长捕捉局部细节，也缺乏有关人体构型的先验知识，这限制了它们用于骨骼表示学习的建模能力。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种简单而有效的图形增强的MLP式架构，称为GraphMLP，它结合了MLP和图形卷积网络（GCN）在全局-局部-图形统一架构中用于3D人体姿态估计。GraphMLP将人体的图形结构纳入MLP模型中，以满足3D人体姿态的领域特定需求，同时允许局部和全局的空间交互作用。此外，我们提出了将GraphMLP灵活高效地扩展到视频领域，并展示了可以以可忽略的计算代价来有效地建模复杂的时间动力学。",
