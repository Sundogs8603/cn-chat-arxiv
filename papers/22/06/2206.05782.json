    "translated_abstract": "在千亿级别的全尺度图像中进行癌症预测一直是一个具有挑战性的任务。为了进一步增强全尺度图像的可视化表示，现有方法已经探索使用图像金字塔而非单一分辨率图像。尽管如此，它们仍面临两个主要问题，即高计算成本和多分辨率特征融合中未注意到的语义差距。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种名为DSCA的方法，即双流网络和交叉注意力。我们的关键思想是利用两个子流来处理两种分辨率的WSI补丁，其中高分辨率流中设计了一个正方形池来显著降低计算成本，并提出了一种基于交叉注意力的方法来正确处理双流特征的融合。我们在三个公开数据集上验证了我们的DSCA，共计1,911名患者的3,101个WSI。我们的实验和消融研究证实了方法的有效性。",
