    "abstract": "As autonomous systems (AS) increasingly become part of our daily lives, ensuring their trustworthiness is crucial. In order to demonstrate the trustworthiness of an AS, we first need to specify what is required for an AS to be considered trustworthy. This roadmap paper identifies key challenges for specifying for trustworthiness in AS, as identified during the \"Specifying for Trustworthiness\" workshop held as part of the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Trustworthy Autonomous Systems (TAS) programme. We look across a range of AS domains with consideration of the resilience, trust, functionality, verifiability, security, and governance and regulation of AS and identify some of the key specification challenges in these domains. We then highlight the intellectual challenges that are involved with specifying for trustworthiness in AS that cut across domains and are exacerbated by the inherent uncertainty involved with the environments in which AS need to operate.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着自主系统（AS）越来越成为我们日常生活的一部分，确保其信任度至关重要。为了证明AS的信任度，我们首先需要指定AS被认为是可信的所需的条件。这篇路线图论文在英国研究和创新（UKRI）可信任自主系统（TAS）计划的一部分举办的“指定信任度”研讨会中，确定了在AS中为信任度指定的关键挑战。我们跨AS领域展望，考虑AS的弹性、信任度、功能、可验证性、安全性以及治理和监管，并确定了这些领域中的一些关键规范挑战。然后，我们重点介绍了在AS中为信任度指定所涉及的跨领域的思维挑战，并剖析了AS需要运行的环境所固有的不确定性带来的复杂性。",
