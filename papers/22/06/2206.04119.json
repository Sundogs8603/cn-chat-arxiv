Current machine-learning techniques for scaffold design are either limited to unrealistically small scaffolds (up to length 20) or struggle to produce multiple diverse scaffolds. We propose to learn a distribution over diverse and longer protein backbone structures via an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network. We develop SMCDiff to efficiently sample scaffolds from this distribution conditioned on a given motif; our algorithm is the first to theoretically guarantee conditional samples from a diffusion model in the large-compute limit. We evaluate our designed backbones by how well they align with AlphaFold2-predicted structures. We show that our method can (1) sample scaffolds up to 80 residues and (2) achieve structurally diverse scaffolds for a fixed motif.",

    "translated_abstract": "构建支持所需模体的脚手架结构，即赋予蛋白质功能的脚手架设计对于疫苗和酶的设计具有潜在价值。然而，模体脚手架问题的通用解决方案仍然没有出现。目前用于脚手架设计的机器学习技术只适用于长度不超过20的不真实脚手架或难以生成多个不同样式的脚手架。我们提出了利用E(3)-等变图神经网络学习多种多样且长度更长的蛋白质主干结构的分布。我们开发了SMCDiff以有效地从给定的模体条件下的分布中采样出脚手架；我们的算法是第一个理论上保证从大计算极限中扩散模型中的条件样本的算法。我们通过与AlphaFold2预测结构的对齐程度评估我们设计的主干。我们表明我们的方法可以(1)采样长达80个残基的脚手架，并且(2)为固定模体实现结构多样的脚手架。",
