    "abstract": "Neural networks are prone to be biased towards spurious correlations between classes and latent attributes exhibited in a major portion of training data, which ruins their generalization capability. We propose a new method for training debiased classifiers with no spurious attribute label. The key idea is to employ a committee of classifiers as an auxiliary module that identifies bias-conflicting data, i.e., data without spurious correlation, and assigns large weights to them when training the main classifier. The committee is learned as a bootstrapped ensemble so that a majority of its classifiers are biased as well as being diverse, and intentionally fail to predict classes of bias-conflicting data accordingly. The consensus within the committee on prediction difficulty thus provides a reliable cue for identifying and weighting bias-conflicting data. Moreover, the committee is also trained with knowledge transferred from the main classifier so that it gradually becomes debiased along",

    "translated_abstract": "神经网络很容易对训练数据中的类别和内在属性之间的假相关性产生偏见，从而破坏其泛化能力。该研究提出了一种新的方法来训练没有偏见属性标签的去偏分类器。关键思想是采用一个分类器委员会作为辅助模块，在训练主分类器时识别冲突数据（即没有假相关性的数据），并对它们分配较大的权重。委员会以自我启动集成的形式进行学习，其中大多数分类器存在偏差但具有多样化，并有意无法成功预测冲突数据的类别。委员会内部对预测难度的共识因此为识别和权重冲突数据提供了可靠线索。此外，该委员会还使用从主分类器转移的知识进行训练，从而逐渐消除其偏见。",
