    "translated_abstract": "作为“进化计算研究的新的前沿”，进化传输优化（ETO）将克服传统范式中在进化计算研究中对已解决过的相关经验和知识的零重用。在通过ETO进行调度应用中，可以形成一个非常吸引人且竞争激烈的框架，尤其对于中国提出的“碳中和”国际承诺来说，这将为智能调度和绿色调度提供一次“会面”的机会。据我们所知，我们关于调度的这篇论文是一个ETO框架类的作品中的第一项工作，该框架将多目标优化问题与离散情况下的单目标优化问题“碰撞”（而不是多任务优化）。更具体地说，通过新的核心传输机制和学习技术，可以传递给工业应用的关键知识，例如基于遗传算法设置的位置构建块，可以用于置换流水车间问题。",
