    "translated_abstract": "累积文化进化发生在通过社交学习将适应性创新传递给连续的后代时。这个过程塑造了人类的技术创新，但也发生在非人类物种中。尽管传统上认为累积文化依赖于高保真度的社交传输和先进的认知能力，但我在这里展示了一个更简单的系统足够。累积文化在具有目标导向、社交接近性和路径记忆的最小认知架构的人工代理中自发出现。在每一代中，经验有限的个体通过与经验导航者配对从而受益，因为他们可以遵循先前建立的路径。关键是，经验丰富的导航者也通过回归到目标受益于有经验的导航者的存在。当经验丰富的代理人遵循他们记忆中的路径时，他们没有路径记忆的幼稚同伴更有可能朝向目标而不是远离目标。",
    "tldr": "本文通过研究最小认知架构的人工代理，展示出累积文化可以在社交和记忆引导下自发出现，不依赖于高级认知能力。在这个系统中，经验丰富的导航者可以通过已建立的路径传授给幼稚个体，而这样做对于导航者来说也是有益的。"
