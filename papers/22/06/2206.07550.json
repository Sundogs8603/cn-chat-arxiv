    "translated_abstract": "个性起源于哲学探索，关注个体在思考、情感和行为方面的差异。为了构建能够与人类日常合作的社交机器，我们想知道：现有的大型语言模型(LLMs)是否拥有与人类类似的个性？如果是，我们如何评估它们？进一步地，在此评估框架的基础上，如何以可控的方式诱导具有特定个性的语言模型？为回答这些问题，我们提出了机器个性库(Machine Personality Inventory, MPI)数据集，用于评估机器的个性。MPI遵循标准化的个性测试，基于五因素人格理论和人格评估库建立。通过用MPI系统地评估LLM，我们提供了第一个证据，证明了LLM的个性。我们进一步设计了一种个性提示(Personality Prompting, P^2)方法，以可控的方式诱导LLMs具有特定的个性。",
