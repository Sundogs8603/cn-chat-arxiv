    "abstract": "Equality of opportunity has emerged as an important ideal of distributive justice. Empirically, Inequality of Opportunity (IOp) is measured in two steps: first, an outcome (e.g., income) is predicted given individual circumstances; and second, an inequality index (e.g., Gini) of the predictions is computed. Machine Learning (ML) methods are tremendously useful in the first step. However, they can cause sizable biases in IOp since the bias-variance trade-off allows the bias to creep in the second step. We propose a simple debiased IOp estimator robust to such ML biases and provide the first valid inferential theory for IOp. We demonstrate improved performance in simulations and report the first unbiased measures of income IOp in Europe. Mother's education and father's occupation are the circumstances that explain the most. Plug-in estimators are very sensitive to the ML algorithm, while debiased IOp estimators are robust.

    "translated_abstract": "机会平等已经成为分配公正的重要理念。实证上，机会不平等(IOp)通过两个步骤进行测量：首先，根据个人情况预测一个结果（如收入）；然后，计算预测的不平等指数（如基尼系数）。机器学习方法在第一步非常有用。然而，在IOp的第二步中，它们可能会导致相当大的偏差，因为偏差-方差权衡允许偏差渗入。我们提出了一个简单的，抵消了这种机器学习偏差的IOp估计器，并提供了第一个有效的IOp推论理论。我们在模拟中展示了改进的性能，并报道了欧洲的首个无偏收入IOp度量。母亲的教育和父亲的职业是最重要的解释因素。插值估计器对机器学习算法非常敏感，而抵消偏差的IOp估计器则具有鲁棒性。这些结果还扩展到了一般的U-统计设置。",
