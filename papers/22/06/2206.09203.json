    "translated_abstract": "人类的基本认知能力之一是通过生成假设并通过积极试验来迅速解决不确定性。当遇到伴随着模糊的因果关系的新现象时，人类对数据提出假设，通过观察进行推理，通过实验来测试他们的理论，并在不一致出现时修正命题。这些迭代过程持续到底层机制变得清晰为止。在这项工作中，我们设计了一个名为IVRE（读作\"ivory\"）的环境，用于评估人工智能代理在不确定性下的推理能力。IVRE是一个交互式环境，围绕Blicket检测的丰富场景展开。IVRE中的代理被放置在具有各种模糊的动作-效果对的环境中，并被要求确定每个对象的角色。他们被鼓励基于观察提出有效且高效的实验来验证他们的假设，并积极收集新的信息。",
