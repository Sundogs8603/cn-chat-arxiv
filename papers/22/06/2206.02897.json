    "translated_abstract": "团体公平指标是评估基于预测的决策系统公平性的一种已经确立的方法。然而，这些指标仍然不足以与哲学理论联系起来，并且它们的道德含义经常不明确。在本文中，我们提出了一个全面的团体公平指标框架，将它们与更多的分配公正理论联系起来。不同的团体公平指标在衡量决策对受影响人员的利益或伤害以及所假设的道德权利方面有所不同。我们的统一框架揭示了标准团体公平指标所涉及的规范选择，并允许解释它们的道德实质。此外，这个更广泛的视角为我们在文献中找到的标准公平指标的扩展提供了一个结构。这个扩展允许解决标准团体公平指标的若干批评，特别是它们是基于平等的，即它们...",
