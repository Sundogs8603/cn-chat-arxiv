The two main causes of the variation in the cost of distancing we explore are distancing fatigue and public policies (lockdowns).

Distancing fatigue cannot increase the distancing cost sufficiently fast to create a second wave. However, public policies that discontinuously affect the distancing cost can create a second wave. With that in mind, we characterize the largest change in the distancing cost (due to, for example, lifting a public policy) that will not cause a second wave.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个具有时间变化的社交距离成本的行为SIR模型。我们探讨了影响社交距离成本变化的两个主要原因：社交距离疲劳和公共政策（封锁）。我们表明，要出现第二波流行病，社交距离成本必须大幅增加。社交距离疲劳无法以足够快的速度增加社交距离成本，从而产生第二波流行病。然而，突变影响社交距离成本的公共政策可以产生第二波流行病。基于这一点，我们确定了社交距离成本的最大变化（例如，解除公共政策），不会引起第二波流行病。最后，我们对社交距离疲劳下的公共政策进行了数值分析，并表明在流行病刚开始时实施严格封锁措施（例如，最近在中国）可能会产生意想不到的负面后果。当政策解除时，由于累积的社交距离疲劳，疾病会迅速传播。",
