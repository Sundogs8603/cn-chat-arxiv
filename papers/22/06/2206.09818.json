    "translated_abstract": "准确预测药物靶点亲和性（DTA）在早期药物研发中至关重要，有助于识别可以与特定靶点有效相互作用并调节其活性的药物。尽管湿实验仍然是最可靠的方法，但它们耗时耗力，导致有限的数据可用性，给深度学习方法带来挑战。现有方法主要集中在基于现有DTA数据开发技术上，没有充分解决数据稀缺问题。为了克服这个难题，我们提出了SSM-DTA框架，它包含三种简单而高效的策略：（1）多任务训练方法，将DTA预测与蒙版语言建模（MLM）结合起来，使用成对的药物-靶点数据。（2）半监督训练方法，利用大规模的无配对分子和蛋白质来增强药物和靶点的表示。这种方法与现有方法不同。",
