There are now multiple reasons to motivate looking at richer alternatives to classical probability theory as a mathematical foundation for machine learning. We systematically examine a powerful and rich class of alternative aggregation functionals, known variously as spectral risk measures, Choquet integrals or Lorentz norms. We present a range of characterization results, and demonstrate what makes this spectral family so special. In doing so we arrive at a natural stratification of all coherent risk measures in terms of the upper probabilities that they induce by exploiting results from the theory of rearrangement invariant Banach spaces.

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习通常假设经典概率论，这意味着聚合建立在期望之上。现在有多个理由来寻找比经典概率论更丰富的替代数学基础，用于机器学习。我们系统地研究了一种强大而丰富的替代聚合函数类，被称为谱风险度量、Choquet积分或Lorentz范数。我们提出了一系列表征结果，并展示了这个谱家族的特殊之处。通过利用可重排不变Banach空间理论的结果，我们得到了一种自然的对所有连贯风险度量进行分层的方法，用于表示它们所引导的上概率。我们从实证角度演示了这种新的不确定性处理方法如何帮助解决实际的机器学习问题。",
