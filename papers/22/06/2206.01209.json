    "translated_abstract": "本文针对具有局部Lipschitz连续梯度的凸优化问题，开发了加速的一阶方法。特别地，我们首先考虑了具有LLCG的无约束凸优化，并提出了加速近端梯度算法(APG)来解决它。所提出的APG方法具有可验证的终止准则，并且在寻找无约束凸优化和强凸优化问题的ε-残差解时，其操作复杂度分别为${\\cal O}(\\varepsilon^{-1/2}\\log \\varepsilon^{-1})$和${\\cal O}(\\log \\varepsilon^{-1})$。然后，我们考虑了具有LLCG的约束凸优化，并提出了一种一阶近端增广拉格朗日方法来解决它，通过将我们提出的APG方法应用于近似求解一系列近端增广拉格朗日子问题。由此得出的方法具有可验证的终止准则，并且具有快速的收敛速度。",
