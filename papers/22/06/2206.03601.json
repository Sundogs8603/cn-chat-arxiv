    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在图上进行节点表示学习的自监督学习问题。大部分现有的自监督学习方法都假设图是同质的，即连接的节点通常属于同一类或具有相似的特征。然而，在现实世界的图中，这种同质性的假设并不总是成立。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种用于图神经网络的解耦自监督学习（DSSL）框架。DSSL通过从语义结构的潜变量建模中模拟节点和链接的生成过程，将不同邻域之间的不同潜在语义解耦到自监督学习过程中。我们的DSSL框架对编码器不敏感，并且不需要预制的增强，因此适用于不同的图。为了有效优化该框架，我们推导了自监督目标的证据下界，并开发了一个具有变分特性的可扩展训练算法。",
