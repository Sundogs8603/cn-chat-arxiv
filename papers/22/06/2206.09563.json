    "translated_abstract": "在MapReduce模型中对子模型函数进行分布式最大化的研究已经引起了广泛的关注，这导致了两种框架可以在MR环境中运行集中式算法而不损失逼近性能，只要集中式算法满足一定的一致性特性 - 这个特性仅由标准的贪婪算法和连续贪婪算法满足。另一方面，还有一系列的研究工作着眼于自适应复杂度模型中的子模型最大化的并行计算能力，其中每个线程可以访问整个底集。对于满足大小约束的单调子模型函数最大化问题，我们展示了几种次线性自适应算法满足在MR环境中所需的一致性特性，从而得到了高度实用的可并行计算和分布式算法。此外，我们还开发了第一个具有恒定MR轮次的线性时间分布式算法。最后，我们提供了一种增加m的方法。",
