    "translated_abstract": "知识嵌入是通过将实体和关系嵌入到连续向量空间中来表示知识图谱的一种方法。现有的方法主要是基于结构或基于描述。基于结构的方法学习表示，以保留知识图谱的内在结构。它们不能很好地表示现实世界知识图谱中有限结构信息下丰富的长尾实体。基于描述的方法利用文本信息和语言模型。在这个方向上的先前方法几乎无法超越基于结构的方法，并且存在昂贵的负采样和限制性描述需求等问题。在本文中，我们提出了LMKE，采用语言模型来推导知识嵌入，旨在丰富长尾实体的表示并解决基于描述的先前方法的问题。我们用对比学习框架来表述基于描述的知识嵌入学习，以提高训练和评价的效率。实验结果表明，LMKE在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，超越了基于结构和基于先前描述的方法。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a method called LMKE, which uses language models to derive Knowledge Embeddings, aiming to enhance the representation of long-tail entities and solve the problems of prior description-based methods. Experimental results show that LMKE achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, surpassing both structure-based and prior description-based methods."
