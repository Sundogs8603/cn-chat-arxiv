    "translated_abstract": "在基于预测的决策系统中，不同的观点常常存在矛盾：决策制定者的短期商业目标与决策对象希望得到公正待遇的愿望往往相冲突。平衡这两种观点是一个关乎价值观的问题。但是，这些价值观常常隐藏在决策系统实施的技术细节中。本文提出了一个框架，使这些价值含义明确可见。我们专注于一个我们想找到能够平衡决策制定者和决策对象观点的决策规则的设置。我们提供了一个方法来形式化和评估决策制定者和决策对象的效用和公正性。对于公正性评估，我们基于公正的分配理论和算法公正的文献研究。对于效用评估，我们提出了一种基于基数效用函数的方法。我们通过将其应用于机器学习中公平性文献研究中的一个著名例子来说明我们的框架。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一个公正与效用并重的算法决策框架，能够平衡决策制定者和决策对象的观点，其中公正性评估基于公正的分配理论和算法公正的文献研究，效用评估基于基数效用函数。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a justice-based framework that balances the perspectives of decision makers and decision subjects by formalizing and evaluating utility and fairness. The fairness evaluation builds on distributive justice theories and algorithmic fairness literature, while the utility evaluation uses cardinal utility functions. The framework is illustrated by applying it to a well-known example of fairness in machine learning."
