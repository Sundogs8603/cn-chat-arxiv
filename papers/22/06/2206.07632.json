    "translated_abstract": "现有的分子生成模型的一个众所周知的局限性是生成的分子与训练集中的分子高度相似。为了生成全新的分子以寻找更好的新颖药物，需要更强大的化学空间探索技术。为此，我们提出了分数-based异分布扩散策略(MOOD)，该策略在随机微分方程(SDE)的生成中结合了异分布(OOD)控制，同时通过简单的超参数控制而无需额外的成本。由于一些新颖分子可能无法满足现实药物的基本要求，MOOD利用属性预测器的梯度进行条件生成，从而使得逆向时间扩散过程通过指导目标特性（如蛋白质-配体相互作用、药物样性和可合成性）到高分数区域，从而允许MOOD搜索新颖且有意义的分子。",
