    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的神经网络框架MSGazeNet，通过多流注视估计从眼部解剖信息中学习注视表示。我们的解决方案由两个组件组成，第一个是用于隔离解剖眼区的网络，第二个是用于多流注视估计的网络。眼部区域隔离是使用U-Net风格的网络进行的，我们使用包含可见眼球和虹膜区域眼部区域掩模的合成数据集进行训练。在这个阶段使用的合成数据集是利用UnityEyes模拟器获得的，包含了80,000个眼部图像。在训练后，眼部区域隔离网络被转移到真实领域，用于生成真实世界眼部图像的掩模。为了成功进行迁移，我们在训练过程中利用领域随机化，通过类似于伪像的增强技术使合成图像受益于更大的变化。",
