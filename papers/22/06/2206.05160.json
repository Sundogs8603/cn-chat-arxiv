    "abstract": "We study a class of {\\em aggregation rules} that could be applied to ethical AI decision-making. These rules yield the decisions to be made by automated systems based on the information of profiles of preferences over possible choices. We consider two different but very intuitive notions of preferences of an alternative over another one, namely {\\it pairwise majority} and {\\it position} dominance. Preferences are represented by permutation processes over alternatives and aggregation rules are applied to obtain results that are socially considered to be ethically correct. In this setting, we find many aggregation rules that satisfy desirable properties for an autonomous system. We also address the problem of the stability of the aggregation process, which is important when the information is variable.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一类可应用于伦理人工智能决策的聚合规则。这些规则根据对可能选择的偏好配置进行决策，得出自动化系统应作出的决策。我们考虑了两种不同但非常直观的偏好概念，即“成对多数”和“位置支配”。偏好通过对替代方案的排列过程表示，聚合规则应用于获得被社会认为符合伦理的结果。在这个设置中，我们找到了许多满足自治系统所需属性的聚合规则。我们还解决了聚合过程稳定性的问题，这在信息是可变的情况下很重要。这些结果是为那些想要为自治系统的决策提供合理性的人工智能设计师的一个贡献。",
