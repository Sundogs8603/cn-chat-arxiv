    "translated_abstract": "数字孪生是一种代表个体的计算机模型，例如组件、患者或过程。 在许多情况下，我们想从数据中获取有关个体的知识，同时结合不完美的物理知识，并从其他个体的数据中学习。 本文介绍了一种全贝叶斯方法，用于在每个个体的物理参数引起兴趣的情况下学习数字孪生之间的关系。 在个性化模型的模型公式中引入了模型差异项，以解释低保真模型中缺失的物理现象。 为了允许个体之间共享信息，我们介绍了一个贝叶斯分层建模框架，其中通过新层将个体模型连接起来。 我们的方法在两个案例研究中进行了演示，一个是先前在文献中使用的玩具示例，扩展到更多个体的情况，一个是与治疗高血压相关的心血管模型。",
