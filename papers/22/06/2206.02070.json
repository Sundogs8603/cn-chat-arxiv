    "translated_abstract": "图像恢复和增强是通过去除噪声、模糊和分辨率降低等降质来改善图像质量的过程。深度学习（DL）最近被应用于图像恢复和增强。由于其逆问题的特性，许多研究已经探索了先验知识来帮助训练深度神经网络（DNNs）。然而，迄今为止，先验知识的重要性尚未被系统地研究和分析。因此，本文是第一次对深度图像恢复和增强的先验知识的最新进展进行全面概述的研究。我们的工作包括五个主要内容：（1）对深度图像恢复和增强的先验知识进行理论分析；（2）对DL方法中常用的先验知识进行分层和结构化分类；（3）对每个先验知识的原理、潜力和应用进行深入讨论；（4）通过重点突出关键问题的总结",
