Entity Linking (EL) is an effective and widely used method for understanding natural language text and connecting it to external knowledge.

In this paper, we introduce a collection and a tool for entity linking in conversations. We collect EL annotations for 1327 conversational utterances, consisting of links to named entities, concepts, and personal entities.

    "translated_abstract": "构建可以与人类进行自然且基于知识的互动的对话代理需要理解用户的话语。实体链接（EL）是一种理解自然语言文本并将其与外部知识连接的有效且广泛使用的方法。然而，已有的用于文档注释的EL方法在对话中表现不佳，因为对于理解用户的话语来说，个人实体（例如，“我的汽车”）和概念是必不可少的。本文介绍了一个用于对话中实体链接的数据集和工具。我们为1327个对话话语收集了EL注释，包括命名实体、概念和个人实体的链接。该数据集用于训练我们的对话实体链接工具CREL。与现有的EL方法不同，CREL旨在识别命名实体和概念，并利用共指消解技术识别个人实体和引用。",
