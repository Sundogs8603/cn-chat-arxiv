    "translated_abstract": "两个分支的网络结构已经在实时语义分割任务中展现出其高效性和有效性。然而，高分辨率细节和低频率背景信息的直接融合存在细节特征容易被周围背景信息淹没的缺点，这种超调现象限制了现有两个分支模型的分割准确性改善。本文将卷积神经网络 (CNN) 和 比例积分微分 (PID) 控制器建立起联系，并揭示出两个分支网络相当于一个比例积分 (PI) 控制器，其本质上也存在类似的超调问题。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的三分支网络结构：PIDNet，其中包括三个分支，分别解析详细、上下文和边界信息，采用边界注意力引导详细和上下文分支的融合。我们的 PIDNet 系列在各种数据集上实现了最佳的实时语义分割表现，包括 Cityscapes、CamVid 和 COCO-Stuff。",
