    "translated_abstract": "半监督学习是将少量标记数据集与较大的未标记数据集相结合，训练出准确的预测模型的问题。已经开发了许多半监督深度学习方法，包括伪标签、一致性正则化和对比学习技术。然而，伪标签方法容易受到混淆的影响，在早期迭代中，错误的伪标签被认为是真实标签，导致模型加强其先前的偏见，进而无法很好地推广到强大的预测性能。我们提出了一种新方法，通过一个我们称之为半监督对比异常值剔除的伪最大期望化方法（SCOPE）来抑制混淆错误。像基本的伪标签方法一样，SCOPE与最大期望化（EM）相关，EM是一种潜变量框架，可以扩展到理解聚类假设的深度半监督算法。但是，与基本的方法不同。",
