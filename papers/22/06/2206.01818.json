    "translated_abstract": "多关系问题回答（QA）是一项具有挑战性的任务，通常需要在由多个关系组成的知识图谱中进行长时间推理链的问题。最近，在这一任务中明显使用了基于知识图谱的显式多步推理方法，并展现出了良好的性能。这些方法包括通过知识图谱三元组逐步标签传播的方法以及基于强化学习浏览知识图谱三元组的方法。这些方法的一个主要弱点是它们的推理机制通常复杂且难以实现或训练。在本文中，我们认为可以通过端到端单步隐式推理实现多关系QA，这种方法更简单、更高效且更易于采用。我们提出了 QAGCN -- 一种基于问题意识的图卷积网络（GCN）方法，其中包括一种新颖的具有受控问题相关信息传播的GCN架构。",
