    "translated_abstract": "传统的最短路径图核心（SP）是最受欢迎的图核心之一。它将图分解为最短路径，并计算每个图中最短路径的频率。然而，SP面临两个主要挑战：首先，最短路径的三元表示失去了信息。其次，SP比较图时没有考虑到图结构的多个不同尺度，而这在现实世界的图中很常见，例如社交网络中的链状结构、环状结构和星状结构。为了克服这两个挑战，我们开发了一种新颖的最短路径图核心，称为多尺度Wasserstein最短路径过滤图核心（MWSPF）。它使用以每个顶点为根的某个深度的BFS树来限制考虑最短路径的最大长度，考虑到小世界特性。它考虑了最短路径中所有顶点的标签。为了方便在多个不同尺度上比较图，它从顶点和",
