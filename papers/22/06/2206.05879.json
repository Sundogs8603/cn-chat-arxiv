In our model, not only do the teams have preferences over the players as in the canonical fair division setting, but the players also have preferences over the teams.

We show that an allocation satisfying EF1, swap stability, and individual stability always exists and can be computed in polynomial time, even when teams may have positive or negative values for players. Similarly, a balanced and swap stable allocation that satisfies a relaxation of EF1 can be computed efficiently. When teams have nonnegative values for players, we prove that an EF1 and Pareto optimal allocation exists and, if the valuations are binary, can be found in polynomial time.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一个公平分配的设置，在这个设置中，一些玩家需要在一组团队之间公平地分配。在我们的模型中，不仅团队像经典公平分配一样对玩家有偏好，而且玩家也对团队有偏好。我们的研究重点是保证团队能获得最多一个人的不满（EF1），同时两侧能保持稳定。我们展示出，一种满足EF1、交换稳定和个人稳定的分配总是存在的，并且可以在多项式时间内计算出来，即便团队对玩家有正值或负值的情况下也是如此。同样，一个满足EF1松弛条件并且平衡及交换稳定的分配可以有效地计算。当团队对玩家的价值非负时，我们证明了可以存在EF1和Pareto最优分配，如果估价是二元的，那么可在多项式时间内找到。我们还研究了EF1和激励无嫉妒的相容性。",
