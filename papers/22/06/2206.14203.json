    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种名为“潜在组合游戏设计”的方法，使用深度生成潜变量模型将给定的一组游戏混合到所需组合中以生成可玩游戏。我们使用高斯混合变分自编码器 (GMVAEs) 对 VAE 潜在空间进行建模，通过监督式训练，每个组件对应一个游戏的水平，并使我们能够将混合游戏定义为这些组件的线性组合，这使得能够生成新游戏，并控制混合中每个游戏的比例。我们还使用有条件变分自编码器扩展以前的混合工作，并与 GMVAE 进行比较，同时引入了混合条件 GMVAE (CGMVAE) 结构，使我们能够生成整个混合水平和布局。结果表明，上述方法可以生成按指定组合混合的可玩游戏。我们使用平台游戏和地下城类游戏来展示我们方法的可行性和灵活性。",
