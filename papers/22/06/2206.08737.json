    "translated_abstract": "尽管在工业和服务机器人中具有重要性，移动操纵仍然是一个巨大的挑战，因为它要求将末端执行器轨迹生成与导航技能以及在长时间范围内进行推理的无缝集成。现有方法难以控制大型配置空间，无法在动态和未知环境中进行导航。在先前的工作中，我们提出将移动操纵任务分解为任务空间中末端执行器的简化运动生成器和针对运动的运动基准学习强化学习代理。在这项工作中，我们引入了神经网络导航移动操纵（N$^2$M$^2$），它将这种分解推广到复杂的障碍环境，并使其能够处理真实世界情况下的广泛任务。由此产生的方法可以在未知环境中执行未见过的、长时间范围内的任务，并即时应对动态障碍物和环境变化。",
