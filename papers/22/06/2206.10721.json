    "abstract": "We use \"glide charts\" (plots of sequences of root mean squared forecast errors as the target date is approached) to evaluate and compare fixed-target forecasts of Arctic sea ice. We first use them to evaluate the simple feature-engineered linear regression (FELR) forecasts of Diebold and Goebel (2021), and to compare FELR forecasts to naive pure-trend benchmark forecasts. Then we introduce a much more sophisticated feature-engineered machine learning (FEML) model, and we use glide charts to evaluate FEML forecasts and compare them to a FELR benchmark. Our substantive results include the frequent appearance of predictability thresholds, which differ across months, meaning that accuracy initially fails to improve as the target date is approached but then increases progressively once a threshold lead time is crossed. Also, we find that FEML can improve appreciably over FELR when forecasting \"turning point\" months in the annual cycle at horizons of one to three months ahead.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们使用“Glide图”（当目标日期临近时，序列均方根预测误差的绘图）来评估和比较北极海冰的固定目标预测。我们首先使用它们评估Diebold和Goebel（2021）的简单特征设计线性回归（FELR）预测，并将FELR预测与天真的纯趋势基准预测进行比较。然后我们引入更为复杂的特征设计机器学习（FEML）模型，并使用Glide图评估FEML预测并将其与FELR基准进行比较。我们的实质性结果包括可预测性阈值的频繁出现，这些阈值在不同月份之间有所不同，这意味着准确性最初并不随着目标日期的临近而改善，但一旦超过阈值领先时间，准确性就会逐渐提高。此外，我们发现当在一到三个月的时间范围内对年循环的“转折点”月份进行预测时，FEML可以显着改善FELR。",
