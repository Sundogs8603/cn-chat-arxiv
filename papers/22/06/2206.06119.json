Here, we combine cocoa plantation data with publicly available satellite imagery in a deep learning framework and create high-resolution maps of cocoa plantations for both countries, validated in situ. Our results suggest that cocoa cultivation is an underlying driver of over 37% and 13% of forest loss in protected areas in C\\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana, respectively, and that official reports substantially underestimate the planted area, up to 40% in Ghana.

    "translated_abstract": "科特迪瓦和加纳是全球最大的可可生产国，两国占全球可可产量的三分之二。在两个国家，可可是主要的多年生作物，为近两百万农民提供收入。然而，精确的可可种植区地图缺失，阻碍了对保护区扩张、产量和收益增长的准确量化，限制了可持续性治理所需的信息。本文结合可可种植数据和公开的卫星图像，采用深度学习框架，为两国创建了高分辨率的可可种植区地图，并在现场验证了其准确性。我们的研究发现，可可种植是科特迪瓦和加纳保护区森林损失的基本驱动因素，分别占37％和13％，而官方报告的可可种植面积明显低估，在加纳低估高达40％。这些地图是推进保护和经济理解的关键基础。",
