    "translated_abstract": "股市中出现的不定期大幅波动是由基本参数、技术设置和外部因素的变化引起的。这些大幅波动被称为极端事件 (EE)。EE可以是积极的或消极的，具体取决于这些因素的影响。在此类事件中，股票价格时间序列被发现是非平稳的。因此，使用希尔伯特-黄变换 (HHT) 基于其高瞬时能量 ($IE$) 浓度来识别EE。分析表明，股价中的 $IE$ 浓度在积极和消极的EE中均非常高，其中 $IE>E_{\\mu}+4\\sigma$，其中 $E_{\\mu}$ 和 $\\sigma$ 分别是能量的平均值和标准差。此外，采用支持向量回归预测EE期间的股票价格，其中收盘价格比开盘-最高-最低-收盘 (OHLC) 输入更有帮助。使用收盘价和OHLC价格进行一步最大预测精度为95.98\\%。",
