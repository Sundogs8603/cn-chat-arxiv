    "translated_abstract": "内容创作者在争夺用户注意力。他们的影响力在很大程度上取决于在线平台开发者所做的算法选择。为了最大限度地提高曝光率，许多创作者采取战略性的调整，如搜索引擎优化行业的例子所证明。这导致了对有限用户注意力池的竞争。我们在所谓的曝光游戏中形式化了这些动态，这是一种由算法引起的激励模型，其中包括现代分解和（深层）两塔架构。我们证明了看似无害的算法选择，例如非负与无约束分解，在曝光游戏中显著影响（纳什）均衡的存在和特性。我们提出使用创作者行为模型，如曝光游戏，进行（ex-ante）预部署审计。这样的审计可以识别期望和激励内容之间的不匹配，并在内容过滤和管理等事后措施上进行补充。为此，我们提出了一些工具。",
