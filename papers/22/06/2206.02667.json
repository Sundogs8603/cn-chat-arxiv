    "translated_abstract": "在基于数据驱动的服务中选择参与，往往基于该服务的质量，影响了服务学习和改进的能力。我们研究了当学习者和用户子群都具有风险减少性质时，参与和重新训练的动态生成的情况，其中包括了梯度下降、乘法权重等广泛的更新方法。举个例子，假设个体选择在社交媒体平台上花费时间的比例与每个平台对他们的工作效果成比例。每个平台还会收集其活跃用户的数据，并用梯度步骤更新参数。对于这个例子和我们的一般动态类别，我们展示了唯一的渐近稳定均衡是细分的，将子群分配给单个学习者。在温和的假设下，功利主义社会最优是一个稳定均衡。与先前的工作相反，先前的工作显示重复的风险最小化可能不会对韧性和利益进行任何保证。",
