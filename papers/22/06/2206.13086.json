    "translated_abstract": "分割已成为计算机视觉和自然语言处理的基本领域，它将标签分配给每个像素/特征，以从图像/文本中提取感兴趣的区域。为了评估分割性能，使用Dice和IoU指标来衡量实际值和预测分割之间的重叠程度。本文建立了与Dice/IoU指标相关的分割理论基础，包括类比于分类的贝叶斯规则和Dice-/IoU-校准。我们证明了现有的基于阈值的框架对于Dice/IoU指标缺乏一致性，因此可能导致次优解决方案。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的一致排序框架，即RankDice/RankIoU，受贝叶斯分割规则的插入法则的启发。本文提供了三个使用GPU并行执行的数字算法。",
