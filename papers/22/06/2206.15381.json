    "translated_abstract": "尽管当前的词嵌入模型取得了成功，但它们仍然缺乏与现实世界的联系。在这一研究中，Gunther等人提出了一项行为实验来探究词语和图像之间的关系。在实验中，参与者将被呈现一个目标名词和一对图像，其中一个由模型选择，另一个随机选择。参与者被要求选择与目标名词最匹配的图像。在大多数情况下，参与者更喜欢模型选择的图像。因此，Gunther等人得出了词语和具体体验之间存在直接联系的可能性。我们以他们的实验为出发点，探讨了以下问题。1.除了利用给定图像的视觉化模拟外，受试者可能还使用了哪些策略来解决这个任务？这个设置在多大程度上依赖于来自图像的视觉信息？是否可以使用纯文本表示来解决它？",
    "tldr": "该研究调查了词语和图像之间的联系，实验结果表明存在直接的联系。研究探讨了除了图像模拟外，受试者可能采用的其他策略，并分析了任务解决是否依赖于视觉信息。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study investigated the link between words and images, finding evidence of a direct connection. The researchers explored alternative strategies participants may have used in addition to visual simulation and analyzed the extent to which solving the task relies on visual information."
