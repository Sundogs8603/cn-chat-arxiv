    "translated_abstract": "模型误指定是理论和实证经济学中的一个重要问题。在误指定的马尔可夫决策过程的具体背景下，Esponda和Pouzo (2021)定义了Berk-Nash均衡的概念，并在有限状态和行动空间的设置中建立了其存在性。然而，许多实际应用（包括Esponda和Pouzo提出的三个激励示例中的两个，以及高斯和对数正态分布，和CARA，CRRA和均值方差偏好）涉及连续状态或行动空间，因此不适用于Esponda-Pouzo的存在定理。我们将Berk-Nash均衡的存在性推广到紧致行动空间和sigma-紧致态空间，可能存在无界收益函数的情况。这引发了一个复杂性问题，因为Berk-Nash均衡概念严重依赖Radon-Nikodym导数，在有限情况下必然有界，但在误指定的连续模式下通常是无界的。",
