    "abstract": "Children's early speech often bears little resemblance to that of adults, and yet parents and other caregivers are able to interpret that speech and react accordingly. Here we investigate how these adult inferences as listeners reflect sophisticated beliefs about what children are trying to communicate, as well as how children are likely to pronounce words. Using a Bayesian framework for modeling spoken word recognition, we find that computational models can replicate adult interpretations of children's speech only when they include strong, context-specific prior expectations about the messages that children will want to communicate. This points to a critical role of adult cognitive processes in supporting early communication and reveals how children can actively prompt adults to take actions on their behalf even when they have only a nascent understanding of the adult language.

    "translated_abstract": "幼儿期的语言常常与成人的语言不太相似，但是父母和其他照顾者能够理解这些语言并据此做出反应。本文研究了成人作为听众如何反映他们对儿童试图传达什么以及儿童发音的复杂信念。使用贝叶斯框架建模口语识别，我们发现仅当计算模型包含关于儿童想要传达的信息的强烈的、特定于语境的先验期望时，它们才能复制成人对幼儿语言的解释。这指出了成人认知过程在支持早期沟通中发挥的至关重要的作用，并揭示了儿童如何在仅有初步的成人语言理解时，积极引导成人代表自己采取行动的能力。我们讨论了成人强大的听力能力对于婴幼儿发展理论的广泛影响。",
    "tldr": "成人如何理解幼儿的语言仍是一个复杂的问题，研究发现成人能够理解幼儿语言，是因为他们有关于幼儿试图传达信息的特定先验期望，并揭示了成人在早期沟通中的重要作用。",
    "en_tdlr": "Understanding how adults comprehend young children's speech is a complex issue. The study finds that adults are able to interpret children's speech due to specific prior expectations about the messages that children want to convey, emphasizing the critical role of adults in early communication."
