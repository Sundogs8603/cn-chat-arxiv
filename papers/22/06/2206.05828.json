    "translated_abstract": "机器学习中的歧视通常涉及多个维度（即保护属性）；因此，确保“交集公平性”，即不歧视任何子组，是理想的。众所周知，仅独立地保证每个维度的“边际公平性”通常是不足够的。然而，由于子组的指数数量，直接从数据中度量交集公平性是不可能的。在本文中，我们的主要目标是通过统计分析详细了解边际公平性和交集公平性之间的关系。我们首先确定了一组足够的条件，可以在其中获得精确关系。然后，我们证明了在一般情况下，在高概率下通过边际公平性和其他有意义的统计量可以计算出交集公平性的界限。除了它们的描述价值外，我们还展示了这些理论界限可以利用到一种启发式的提高方法中。",
