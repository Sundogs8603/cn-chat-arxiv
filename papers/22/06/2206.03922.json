    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个灵活的随机逼近框架，用于分析学习博弈的长期行为（包括连续和有限博弈）。所提出的分析模板涵盖了包括基于梯度的方法、用于有限博弈学习的指数/乘法权重算法、上限和遗漏变体等在内的多种常见学习算法。除了提供对这些算法的整合视角，我们的框架还能够得到多个新的收敛结果，包括渐近和有限时间内的结果，在连续和有限博弈中均适用。具体来说，我们提供了一系列可用于识别纳什均衡类别和高概率吸引行动配置集合的标准，我们还引入了一种连贯性的概念，即游戏理论属性，包括严格和尖锐均衡，并且导致在有限时间内收敛。重要的是，我们的分析适用于基于oracle的方法和遗漏方法。",
