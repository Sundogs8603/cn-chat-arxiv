    "abstract": "We study a protocol for distributed computation called shuffled check-in, which achieves strong privacy guarantees without requiring any further trust assumptions beyond a trusted shuffler. Unlike most existing work, shuffled check-in allows clients to make independent and random decisions to participate in the computation, removing the need for server-initiated subsampling. Leveraging differential privacy, we show that shuffled check-in achieves tight privacy guarantees through privacy amplification, with a novel analysis based on R{\\'e}nyi differential privacy that improves privacy accounting over existing work. We also introduce a numerical approach to track the privacy of generic shuffling mechanisms, including Gaussian mechanism, which is the first evaluation of a generic mechanism under the distributed setting within the local/shuffle model in the literature. Empirical studies are also given to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种称为随机签到的分布式计算协议，它在没有任何其他信任假设的情况下实现了强隐私保护。与大多数现有工作不同，随机签到允许客户端独立和随机地决定参与计算，消除了服务器发起的子抽样的需要。利用差分隐私，我们证明随机签到通过隐私放大实现了严格的隐私保护，采用了基于Rényi差分隐私的新分析方法，改进了现有工作的隐私计算。我们还引入了一种数值方法来跟踪通用洗牌机制的隐私性能，包括高斯机制，这是文献中首次对分布式环境中局部/洗牌模型下的通用机制进行评估。实证研究也证明了所提出方法的有效性。",
