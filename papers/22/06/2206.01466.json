    "translated_abstract": "我们利用领域指南来学习鸟类物种识别，特别是对于未知物种的零样本识别。领域指南中的插图有意专注于每个物种的区分特征，并可以作为辅助信息将已知物种的知识迁移到未知鸟类物种上。我们研究了两种方法：（1）对插图进行对比编码，可以输入标准的零样本学习方案；（2）一种利用插图也是图像的事实，并且在结构上更类似于照片而不是其他类型辅助信息的新方法。我们的结果表明，来自领域指南的插图确实是零样本学习的一个有竞争力的辅助信息来源，因为它们可以方便地获取多种物种的插图。在iNaturalist2021数据集的子集中，含有749个已知物种和739个未知物种，我们得到了12%的未知鸟类物种的top-1分类准确率和38%的top-10分类准确率，这表明了其潜在的应用价值。",

By applying contrastive encoding and leveraging the structural similarity between illustrations and photographs, the authors achieved a top-1 classification accuracy of 12% and top-10 classification accuracy of 38%, demonstrating the potential of field guide illustrations as a valuable source of side information."
