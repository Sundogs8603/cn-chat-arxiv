    "translated_abstract": "省略变量是导致因果效应识别受到最大威胁的因素之一。包括Oster（2019）在内的几种广泛使用的方法通过将可观测选择测量与不可观测选择测量进行比较来评估省略变量对经验结论的影响。这些方法要么（1）假设省略的变量与包括的控制变量不相关，这个假设常常被认为是强假设和不可行的，要么（2）使用残差法来避免这个假设。在我们的第一项贡献中，我们开发了一个框架，用于客观地比较敏感度参数。我们利用这个框架正式证明残差化方法通常会导致有关鲁棒性的错误结论。在我们的第二项贡献中，我们提出了一种新的敏感性分析方法，避免了这个批评，允许省略的变量与包含的控制变量相关，并允许研究人员校准灵敏度。",
