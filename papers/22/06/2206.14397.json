In this survey, we analyze the intersection of fairness in machine learning and healthcare disparities. We adopt a framework based on the principles of distributive justice to categorize fairness concerns into two distinct classes: equal allocation and equal performance.

    "translated_abstract": "医疗数据的数字化与计算能力的进步推动了机器学习在医疗保健领域的应用。然而，这些方法可能会加剧或甚至加重现有的差异，导致资源不均和不同人群之间的诊断准确性不一致等公平问题。解决这些公平问题对于防止社会不公正的进一步巩固至关重要。在本综述中，我们分析了机器学习与医疗保健不公平的交叉点。我们采用了一个基于分配公正原则的框架，将公平问题分为两个不同的类别：资源平均分配和性能平等。我们从机器学习的角度对相关的公正度量进行了批判性的回顾，并讨论了机器学习生命周期各个阶段的偏见和缓解策略，探讨了偏见与其对策之间的关系。",
