    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们考虑了对具有非负 Lebesgue 密度且在归一化常数上已知的概率测度进行无偏估计的问题。我们专注于通过欠阻尼 Langevin 动力学开发一种无偏方法，这种方法近来在统计学和机器学习中得到广泛应用。具体来说，在连续时间下，可以构造这种动力学使其随着时间趋于无穷，其稳态测度为所关注的概率测度。在实践中，经常使用离散化的欠阻尼 Langevin 动力学的时间离散版本，仅运行有限次迭代。我们提出了一种基于双重随机估计的新方案，该方案仅需要使用时间离散版本的动力学。所提出的方案旨在消除离散化偏差和由于有限次运行动力学产生的偏差。",
