    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) models achieve great successes in many domains. However, DL models increasingly face safety and robustness concerns, including noisy labeling in the training stage and feature distribution shifts in the testing stage. Previous works made significant progress in addressing these problems, but the focus has largely been on developing solutions for only one problem at a time. For example, recent work has argued for the use of tunable robust loss functions to mitigate label noise, and data augmentation (e.g., AugMix) to combat distribution shifts. As a step towards addressing both problems simultaneously, we introduce AugLoss, a simple but effective methodology that achieves robustness against both train-time noisy labeling and test-time feature distribution shifts by unifying data augmentation and robust loss functions. We conduct comprehensive experiments in varied settings of real-world dataset corruption to showcase the gains achieved by AugLoss compared to previous ",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型在许多领域取得了巨大的成功。然而，深度学习模型越来越面临安全性和鲁棒性方面的问题，包括训练阶段的噪声标注和测试阶段的特征分布转移。以往的研究在解决这些问题方面取得了显著进展，但主要集中在一次只解决一个问题的解决方案上。例如，最近的研究提出了使用可调的稳健损失函数来减轻标签噪声，以及使用数据增强（例如AugMix）来解决分布转移问题。为了同时解决这两个问题，我们引入了AugLoss，一种简单但有效的方法，通过统一数据增强和稳健损失函数，实现了对训练时的噪声标注和测试时的特征分布转移的稳健性。我们在各种真实数据集损坏设置下进行了全面的实验，展示了与以前方法相比AugLoss所取得的收益。",
