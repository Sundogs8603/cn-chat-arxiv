The majority of FL algorithms assume that communication between clients and the server is always available, however, this is not the case in many real-world systems. To address this issue, the paper explores the impact of mobility on the convergence performance of asynchronous FL. By exploiting mobility, the study shows that clients can indirectly communicate with the server through another client serving as a relay, creating additional communication opportunities.

We propose a new FL algorithm, called FedMobile, that incorporates opportunistic relaying and addresses key questions such as when and how to relay.

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文探讨了移动网络环境下的异步联邦学习（FL）。大多数FL算法假设客户端和服务器之间的通信始终可用，然而，在许多实际系统中并非如此。为解决这一问题，本文探讨了移动性对异步FL收敛性能的影响。通过利用移动性，研究表明客户端可以通过另一客户端充当中继与服务器间接通信，创造额外的通信机会。这使客户端能够更早地上传本地模型更新或接收更新的全局模型。我们提出了一种新的FL算法，称为FedMobile，该算法融合了机会性中继，并解决了何时以及如何中继的关键问题。我们证明FedMobile实现了收敛速率为$O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{NT}})$，其中$N$是客户端数量，$T$是客户端数量。",
