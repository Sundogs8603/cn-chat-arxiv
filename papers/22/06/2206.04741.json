    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种全新的量子强化学习方法，并进行了详细的实现和模拟。我们的工作证明量子算法可以用于解决强化学习问题，并表明在代理和环境的无误差高效量子实现的基础上，量子方法在样本复杂度方面可以证明比基于经典蒙特卡罗的方法有更好的性能提升。我们的方法详细地展示了如何将振幅估计和Grover搜索组合成策略评估和改进方案。首先，我们开发了量子策略评估（QPE），其比一个类似的经典蒙特卡罗估计高效平方，基于量子力学实现有限马尔可夫决策过程（MDP）。在QPE的基础上，我们推导出一种量子策略迭代，它使用Grover搜索重复改进初始策略，直到达到最佳策略。最后，我们提供了一种实现方案。",
