    "translated_abstract": "近年来，在分子科学中应用图神经网络（GNNs）的最新进展展示了使用GNNs学习三维（3D）结构表示的强大能力。然而，大多数现有的GNNs存在多样性相互作用建模不足、计算开销大和忽视矢量值的局限性。在这里，我们通过提出一种新颖的GNN模型，即物理感知多重图神经网络（PaxNet），来解决这些限制，以便在小有机化合物和大分子复合物的3D分子表示中高效准确地学习。PaxNet通过分离局部和非局部相互作用的建模，受到分子力学的启发，并减少了昂贵的与角度相关的计算。除了标量属性外，PaxNet还可以通过为每个原子学习一个相关联的矢量来预测矢量属性。为了评估PaxNet的性能，我们将其与两个任务中的最先进基线进行了比较。",
