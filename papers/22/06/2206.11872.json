    "translated_abstract": "Heavy Ball (HB)是当今非凸优化中最受欢迎的动量方法之一。广泛观察到，在梯度下降方法中引入Heavy Ball动力学可以加速现代机器学习模型的训练过程。然而，加速的理论基础在进展上显然远远落后于实证的成功。现有的可证明加速结果仅限于二次或接近二次函数，因为目前HB加速的技术局限于Hessian矩阵固定的情况。在本研究中，我们开发了一些新的技术，通过分析两个连续时间点上Hessian矩阵的变化对收敛速度的影响，实现了超越二次加速的证明。基于我们的技术结果，我们确定了一类Polyak-\\L{}ojasiewicz（PL）优化问题，可以通过HB实现可证明的加速。此外，我们的分析证明了对于这个类别的问题，HB可以提供比传统方法更高的加速效果。",
