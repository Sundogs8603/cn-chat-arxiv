    "translated_abstract": "半监督学习是减少机器学习对标记数据依赖的重要工具。它通过利用预训练模型或数据增强的内在空间和语义结构成功应用于结构化数据，例如图像和自然语言。然而，当数据没有适当的结构或不变性时，这些方法不适用。由于其简单性，伪标签（PL）方法可以在没有任何领域假设的情况下广泛使用。然而，PL 对阈值敏感，如果由于过度自信导致错误分配，则可能表现不佳。本文从理论上研究了不确定性对伪标签的作用，并提出了基于置信泰森堡分配的方法(CSA)，通过最优传输仅对高置信度样本进行伪标签分配。CSA 在半监督学习这一实际重要领域中胜过了当前的最先进方法。此外，所提出的方法具有可扩展性，高效性和易实现性。",
