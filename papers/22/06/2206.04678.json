    "translated_abstract": "布局规划在建筑和城市设计领域中非常重要。在承载城市功能的各种基本单位中，住宅社区对支持人类生活起着至关重要的作用。因此，住宅社区的布局规划一直受到关注，并自深度学习问世以来，尤其引起了人们的关注，因为深度学习有助于自动布局生成和空间模式识别。然而，研究领域普遍面临住宅社区布局基准或高质量数据集的不足，这阻碍了基于数据驱动的住宅社区布局规划方法的进一步探索。数据集的缺乏主要是由于大规模实际住宅数据采集和长期专家筛选的困难。为了解决这些问题，并推进智慧城市发展中各种智能空间设计和分析应用的基准数据集，我们提出了一个名为ReCo的数据集。",
