    "translated_abstract": "最近2D CNN的进展表明大核是重要的。然而，当直接应用大的卷积核在3D CNN中时，会遇到严重困难，2D网络中成功的模块设计在3D网络上变得惊人地无效，包括流行的深度卷积。为了解决这个重要的挑战，我们提出了空间分区卷积及其大核模块。这避免了纯粹3D大核的优化和效率问题。我们的大核3D CNN网络LargeKernel3D，在语义分割和物体检测的3D任务中取得了显着的提高。它在ScanNetv2语义分割和nuScenes物体检测基准测试中分别达到73.9%的mIoU和72.8%的NDS，位列nuScenes LIDAR排行榜第一。通过简单的多模态融合，性能进一步提升至74.2%的NDS。此外，LargeKernel3D 可以在 Waymo 3D 物体检测中扩展到17x17x17的核大小。",
