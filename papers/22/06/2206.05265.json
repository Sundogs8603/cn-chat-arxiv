    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑关于“态重构”的经典问题：在知道一个未知量子态$\\rho\\in\\mathbb{C^{d x d}}$的情况下，给出一个近似的$\\widehat{\\rho}$，使得在某种意义下，例如迹距离或保真度，它接近于$\\rho$。当允许进行纠缠的相干测量时，需要$\\Theta(d^2/\\epsilon^2)$个复制体才能获得迹距离$\\epsilon$的近似。不幸的是，实现这种速率的协议需要大量的量子内存开销，因此不能在近期设备上实现。另一方面，使用非相干（单个复制）测量的协议所需的复制品数量为$O(d^3/\\epsilon^2)$，多篇论文提出了如何理解这个速率是上限还是下限的问题。在这项工作中，通过展示任何使用非相干测量的协议，即使是自适应选择的，都需要$\\Omega(d^3/\\epsilon^2)$个复制品的量，从而匹配已知的最好的上限，我们完全解决了这个问题。通过一种新的P...",
