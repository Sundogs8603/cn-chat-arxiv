    "abstract": "Infectious diseases remain among the top contributors to human illness and death worldwide, among which many diseases produce epidemic waves of infection. The unavailability of specific drugs and ready-to-use vaccines to prevent most of these epidemics makes the situation worse. These force public health officials and policymakers to rely on early warning systems generated by reliable and accurate forecasts of epidemics. Accurate forecasts of epidemics can assist stakeholders in tailoring countermeasures, such as vaccination campaigns, staff scheduling, and resource allocation, to the situation at hand, which could translate to reductions in the impact of a disease. Unfortunately, most of these past epidemics exhibit nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics due to their spreading fluctuations based on seasonal-dependent variability and the nature of these epidemics. We analyse a wide variety of epidemic time series datasets using a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT)",

    "translated_abstract": "传染病仍然是全球人类疾病和死亡的主要因素，其中许多疾病会产生传染性感染的流行波。大多数这些流行病没有特定的药物和预防疫苗，使情况更加恶化。这迫使公共卫生官员和政策制定者依靠可靠和准确的流行病预测所生成的预警系统。然而，由于这些流行病的传播波动基于季节依赖性和它们的本质，大多数过去的这些流行病表现出非线性和非平稳特征。我们利用最大重叠离散小波变换（MODWT）分析了各种流行病时间序列数据集。",
    "tldr": "疫情预测至关重要，但由于传染病的非线性和非平稳特征，预测变得困难。本文介绍了一种称为Epicasting的新算法，使用集成小波神经网络（EWNet）来更准确地预测疫情。",
