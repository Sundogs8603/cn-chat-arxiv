    "translated_abstract": "作为传统的偏微分方程（PDE）边界值约束问题的数值求解器的替代方案，近年来研究人员对能够高效解决此类问题的神经网络兴趣日益增加。本研究使用图神经网络（GNNs）和谱图卷积设计了用于两种不同的时间独立PDE的通用解算器。我们使用来自有限元求解器的模拟数据，在各种形状和不均匀性的情况下对网络进行训练。与以往的工作不同，我们关注训练后的解算器在未见过的情况下的泛化能力。具体而言，我们测试了在具有不同形状的网格和不同个数的不均匀性叠加解的情况下的泛化效果。我们发现，在训练集中包含有限元网格的各种变化的数据是实现良好泛化结果的关键因素。因此，我们相信GNNs可用于解决PDE问题，并能够在各种情况下实现良好的泛化能力。",
