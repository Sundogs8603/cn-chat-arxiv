In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving FL method named FedIIC to combat class imbalance from two perspectives: feature learning and classifier learning.

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL），在不泄露隐私的情况下从分散数据中训练深度模型，最近在医学图像计算中展现出巨大潜力。然而，考虑到医学数据中普遍存在的类别不平衡问题，FL在性能上可能会出现下降，特别是对于少数类（如罕见疾病）。现有方法主要集中于训练一个平衡分类器以消除类别先验偏差，但忽视了探索更好的特征表示以促进分类性能。本文提出了一种名为FedIIC的隐私保护FL方法，从特征学习和分类器学习两个角度解决了类别不平衡问题。在特征学习方面，设计了两级对比学习来提取更好的与不平衡数据相关的类别特定特征。在分类器学习方面，根据实时难度和类别先验动态设置每类间隔，帮助模型平等地学习各个类别。",
