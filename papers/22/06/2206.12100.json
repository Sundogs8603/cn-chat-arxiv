    "translated_abstract": "隐私保护的联邦学习允许多个用户通过中央服务器的协调来共同训练模型。服务器只学习最终聚合结果，因此用户的（私有）训练数据不会从个体模型更新中泄漏出去。然而，保持个体更新的私密性允许恶意用户进行拜占庭攻击，降低准确性但不被检测到。目前对抗拜占庭工人的最佳方法依赖于鲁棒的基于排序的统计信息，例如中位数，以查找恶意更新。然而，在安全领域实现保护隐私的基于排序的统计信息是非常困难和不可扩展的，因为它需要对所有个体更新进行排序。我们建立了第一个使用高断点基于排序的统计信息对聚合模型更新进行私密的鲁棒性检查。通过利用随机化聚类，我们显著提高了我们的防御的可扩展性，同时不损害隐私。我们利用零断点下的统计界限。",
