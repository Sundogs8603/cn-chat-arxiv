    "translated_abstract": "商业流程模拟(BPS)是一种常见的方法，用于估计对业务流程进行更改对其性能指标的影响。例如，通过BPS，我们可以估计如果自动化业务流程中的某个活动或某些资源不可用，该流程的周期时间将是多少。BPS的起点是用模拟参数注释的业务流程模型(BPS模型)。在传统方法中，BPS模型是由建模专家手动设计的。这种方法耗时且容易出错。为了解决这个缺点，一些研究提出了通过过程挖掘技术从事件日志自动发现BPS模型的方法。然而，目前这个领域的技术只发现捕捉由资源争用或资源不可用引起的等待时间的BPS模型。在许多情况下，业务流程中相当一部分的等待时间对应于外部延迟，例如，资源等待客户返回。",
