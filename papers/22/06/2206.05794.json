    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了使用随机梯度下降（SGD）在训练深度ReLU神经网络时学习低秩权重矩阵的偏差。我们的结果表明，使用小批量SGD和权重衰减来训练神经网络会导致对于权重矩阵的秩最小化的偏差。具体而言，我们通过理论和实验证明，当使用较小的批量大小、更高的学习率或增加的权重衰减时，这种偏差更加显著。此外，我们预测并通过实验证明，权重衰减是实现这种偏差的必要条件。此外，我们还发现在中间神经网络崩溃的情况下，学习的权重特别低秩。与先前的文献不同，我们的分析不依赖于关于数据、收敛性或权重矩阵优化的假设。此外，它适用于任意宽度或深度的各种神经网络结构。最后，我们通过实验证明了这种偏差与泛化之间的关系。",
