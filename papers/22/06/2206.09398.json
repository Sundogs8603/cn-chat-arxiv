    "translated_abstract": "个体脑在解剖结构和功能组织上存在差异，甚至在同一物种内也是如此。个体间的变异性是在对一组受试者进行神经影像数据收集时难以得出一般性结论的主要障碍。目前的配准过程依赖于有限的数据，因此导致粗糙的个体间对齐。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于最优输运的个体间对齐方法，称为Fused Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein（FUGW）。该方法基于对大脑皮层表面在不同刺激情况下的功能特征相似性进行对齐，同时惩罚个体的拓扑组织大变形。我们证明FUGW非常适用于整个大脑无标志点的对齐。不平衡特性允许处理功能区域在不同受试者中的大小变化。我们的结果表明，FUGW对齐显著提高了个体间的相关性。",
