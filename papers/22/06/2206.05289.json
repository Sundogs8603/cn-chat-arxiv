    "translated_abstract": "随着对于深度神经网络（DNN）在图像重建任务中的兴趣增加，它们的可靠性受到了质疑。然而，最近的研究表明，在适当正则化的情况下，与总变差（TV）最小化相比，DNN在$\\ell^2$重建误差方面显示出类似的对抗噪声鲁棒性。我们考虑了一种不同的鲁棒性概念，使用$\\ell^\\infty$范数，认为局部重建伪像比$\\ell^2$误差更相关。我们对频域下采样的磁共振成像测量创建了对抗性扰动，该扰动在TV正则化重建中引起严重的局部伪像。值得注意的是，同样的攻击方法对基于DNN的重建效果不如此显著。最后，我们证明了这种现象在可以保证精确恢复的重建方法中是固有的。",
