    "translated_abstract": "现代消费电子设备开始在设备上执行基于深度学习的智能服务，而不是在云服务器上，以保持个人数据在设备上并降低网络和云开销。我们将这样的趋势视为通过使用用户数据更新神经网络而无需将数据暴露在设备之外来个性化智能服务的机会：设备上的训练。然而，设备资源有限带来了显著的困难。我们提出了一种轻量级的设备上训练框架NNTrainer，它提供高度内存效率的神经网络训练技术，并基于细粒度执行顺序分析进行主动交换。此外，其优化不会牺牲准确性，并且对训练算法是透明的；因此，先前的算法研究可以在NNTrainer之上实现。评估结果表明，NNTrainer可以将内存消耗减少到1/20（节省95%！），并有效地个性化智能服务。",
