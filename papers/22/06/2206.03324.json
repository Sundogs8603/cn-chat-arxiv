In particular, N agents request service from K servers in a fully decentralized way, i.e, by running the same algorithm without communication. Previous decentralized algorithms are restricted to symmetric systems, have performance that is degrading exponentially in the number of servers, require communication through shared randomness and unique agent identities, and are computationally demanding. In contrast, we provide a simple learning algorithm that, when run decentrally by each agent, leads the queueing system to have efficient performance in general asymmetric bipartite queueing systems while also having additional robustness properties.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了二分排队系统中的分散式多智能体学习，这是一个服务系统的标准模型。特别地，N个代理以完全分散的方式从K个服务器请求服务，即不进行通信地运行相同的算法。先前的分散式算法仅局限于对称系统，其性能随着服务器数量指数级降低，需要通过共享随机性和唯一的代理身份进行通信，且计算量巨大。相比之下，我们提供了一种简单的学习算法，当每个代理分散地运行时，在普通的非对称二分排队系统中实现了高效的性能，同时还具备附加的鲁棒性质。同时，我们为该问题的集中式情况提供了首个经过证明的有效的UCB算法。",
