    "translated_abstract": "全球最大的6,529家跨国公司负责了近30%的全球CO2e排放量。越来越多的股东和利益相关者意识到企业在可持续发展道路上的作用，因此他们追求越来越严格和雄心勃勃的环境目标。但是，如何客观高效地评估企业的环境绩效仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。本研究揭示了可以用来构建公司环境影响的定量统一图片的基本动态和结构。本研究表明，公司的环境影响（新陈代谢）CO2e能源使用，水取水和废品生产的规模与其规模成简单的幂律关系，这往往是次线性的，并且可以用来推导出一个特定于行业，大小相关的基准来明确评估公司的环境绩效。实施这样的基准可能会导致15%的排放减少。",
