    "translated_abstract": "短期负荷预测在电力交易市场的运作中起着重要作用。考虑到数据隐私保护的日益关注，最近的研究中越来越多地采用联邦学习来为公用事业公司（UCs）训练短期负荷预测模型。在批发市场中，由于电厂无法直接访问UCs的数据，采用联邦学习是一种获取准确的短期负荷预测模型的可行解决方案。然而，由于联邦学习的分布性和UCs之间的激烈竞争，缺陷日益增多，导致短期负荷预测模型性能较差，仅仅采用联邦学习是不够的。本文提出了一种名为DEfect-AwaRe联邦软演员-评论家（DearFSAC）的DRL辅助联邦学习方法，以鲁棒地训练一个准确的短期负荷预测模型，用于预测精确的短期公用电需求。首先，我们基于长短期记忆（LSTM）设计了一个短期负荷预测模型，仅使用历史负荷数据和时间数据。",
