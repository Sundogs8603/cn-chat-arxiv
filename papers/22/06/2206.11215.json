    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一个可验证的物体姿态估计问题，即在给定一个物体的部分点云的情况下，不仅要估计物体的姿态，还要提供一个正确性证明。我们提出了一个关于端到端感知模型认证的通用理论，引入了一个被称为 $\\zeta$-正确性的概念，它约束了估计值和真实值之间的距离。我们证明了 $\\zeta$-正确性可以通过实现两个证书来评估：（i）一个可观察正确性的证书，该证书断言模型输出是否与输入数据和先验信息一致，（ii）一个非退化性证书，它断言输入数据是否足以计算出唯一的估计值。第二，我们将这个理论应用于设计一个新的基于学习的可证明姿态估计器。我们提出 C-3PO，这是一个基于语义关键点的姿态估计模型，增加了两个证书。所提出的模型在合成和实际测量数据集方面均取得了最先进的性能。我们还提出了一个自我训练的方法来进一步提高模型性能。据我们所知，我们的工作是关于可验证的三维物体姿态估计的第一个通用理论和方法。",

In addition, a learning-based certifiable pose estimator, C-3PO, is designed and augmented with two certificates to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. A self-training method is also proposed. The presented work represents the first general theory and methodology for certifiable 3D object pose estimation."
