We address the question of which function classes are PAC learnable in this setting. We show that classes of finite fat-shattering dimension are learnable in both realizable and agnostic settings. Moreover, for convex function classes, they are even properly learnable. In contrast, some non-convex function classes provably require improper learning algorithms. Our main technique is based on a construction of an adversarially robust sample compression scheme of a size determined by the fat-shattering dimension. Along the way, we introduce a novel agnostic sample compression scheme for real-valued functions, which may be of independent interest.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在使用$\\ell_p$损失和任意扰动集的回归设置中，对测试时对抗性攻击的稳健性。我们探讨了在这种情况下哪些函数类是PAC可学习的。我们表明有限胖折射维的类既可以在实现和不可知设置中被学习。此外，对于凸函数类，它们甚至可以正确学习。相比之下，一些非凸函数类显然需要不正当的学习算法。我们的主要技术基于构建一个由胖折射维决定大小的具有对抗鲁棒性的样本压缩方案。在此过程中，我们介绍了一个新颖的面向实值函数的不可知样本压缩方案，这可能是具有独立兴趣的。",
