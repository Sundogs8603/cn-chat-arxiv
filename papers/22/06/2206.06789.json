    "translated_abstract": "混合整数问题在决策制定中非常普遍，包括离散设备设置和设计参数、单元生产、开关中的开/关或是/否决策、路由和社交网络等领域。尽管这些问题很常见，但经典的组合优化优化方法在动态和关键安全环境下进行快速和准确的决策制定仍然过于缓慢。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为SiPhyR（发音：cipher）的物理学启发式机器学习框架，用于端到端学习优化组合问题。SiPhyR采用一种新颖的物理学启发的四舍五入方法来处理组合优化的挑战，在可微分框架内具有安全性关键约束的认证可满足性。我们在清洁能源系统的新兴范例——动态重构上展示了SiPhyR的有效性，在这里，电网的拓扑和功率流被优化以最大化清洁能源的使用。",
