    "translated_abstract": "最优功率流 (OPF) 问题作为电力系统运营的关键组成部分，由于可再生能源的变异性、间歇性和不可预测性给解决带来了越来越大的困难。虽然传统的优化技术，如随机化和鲁棒性优化方法，可以用来解决OPF问题，但面对可再生能源的不确定性，即优化模型中的动态系数，它们在处理大规模问题方面的效果仍然有限。因此，近年来已经开发出深度学习技术，如神经网络，以提高利用数据解决OPF问题的计算效率。然而，解决方案的可行性和最优性可能无法得到保证，系统动态也无法得到适当的处理。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于优化模型信息的生成对抗网络 (MI-GAN) 框架，以解决这些问题。",
