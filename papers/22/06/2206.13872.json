    "translated_abstract": "学习嵌入通常需要通过概念解释来理解和分解，这种需求在解释中不包含有效概念标签的情况下尤为显著。为了提供后验解释，概念发现方法会在已训练的嵌入空间中搜索解释性强的概念，例如物体形状或颜色。与之前的工作不同，我们认为概念发现应该是可识别的，这意味着可以被证明地恢复出多个已知的概念，以确保解释的可靠性。为了作为一个起点，我们明确地将概念发现与传统方法（例如主成分分析和独立成分分析）联系起来，并通过表明它们可以恢复具有非高斯分布的独立概念来阐明这一点。对于具有依赖关系的概念，我们提出了两种新的方法，利用图像生成过程的功能组合性质。我们的可证明可识别的概念发现方法明显优于现有方法。",
