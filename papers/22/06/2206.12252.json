This paper introduces Indecision Trees, a modification to Decision Trees which learn under uncertainty, can perform inference under uncertainty, provide a robust distribution over the possible labels, and can be disassembled into a set of logical arguments for use in other reasoning systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界中使用机器学习系统往往存在问题，比如不可解释的黑盒模型，不完美测量的确定性假设，或者只提供单一分类而不是概率分布。本文介绍了犹豫树，一种对决策树进行修改的方法，能够在不确定性下进行学习，能够进行不确定性推理，提供一个强健的标签分布，并可分解为一组逻辑论证用于其他推理系统。",
