    "translated_abstract": "使用带有查询依赖噪声的20个问题估计框架，我们研究了移动目标在未知初始位置和速度下的非自适应搜索策略，并采用分段常速度模型在单位立方体上进行。在这个搜索问题中，有一个知道任何时候目标瞬时位置的预言机。我们的任务是尽可能少地查询预言机，以准确地估计目标在任何指定时间的位置。我们首先研究了预言机对每个查询的回答都受到离散噪声污染的情况，然后将我们的结果推广到加性高斯噪声的情况。在我们的公式中，性能准则是分辨率，它定义为真实位置和估计位置之间的最大$L_\\infty$距离。我们通过导出非渐近和渐近界来描述具有有限查询次数的最佳非自适应查询过程的最小分辨率。我们的界限是严格的。",
