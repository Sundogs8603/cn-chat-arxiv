Inspired by diffusion models and the empirical success of coarse-to-fine modelling, we propose a new diffusion-like model that generates images through stochastically reversing the heat equation, a PDE that locally erases fine-scale information when run over the 2D plane of the image. We interpret the solution of the forward heat equation with constant additive noise as a variational approximation in the diffusion latent variable model. Our new model shows emergent qualitative properties not seen in standard diffusion models, such as disentanglement of overall colour and shape in images. Spectral analysis on natural images highlights connections to diffusion models and reveals an implicit coarse-to-fine inductive bias in them.",
