    "translated_abstract": "为了利用策略承诺这一游戏策略，领导者必须学习足够的关于追随者的收益函数的信息。然而，这给了追随者提供虚假信息并影响最终游戏结果的机会。通过一个精心设计的收益函数，虚报给学习领导者，追随者可以引导一个对他有更多好处的结果，与他真实行为时的结果相比。我们研究了在广义博弈中通过这种策略行为实现最佳操纵的追随者。我们考虑到了追随者不同的态度。乐观的追随者为了获得真正的公用事业，最大化了所有可以通过某些收益函数引导出的游戏结果。悲观的追随者只考虑引导出一种惟一游戏结果的虚报收益函数。对于本文中考虑的所有设置，我们都描述了可以成功引导的所有可能游戏结果。我们证明了检查一个结果是否可以由追随者在某些给定游戏设定下最优地引导的复杂度是多项式可计算的，并提出了有效的算法来计算最佳操纵。",
