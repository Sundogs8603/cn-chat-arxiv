    "abstract": "We study the decentralized online regularized linear regression algorithm over random time-varying graphs. At each time step, every node runs an online estimation algorithm consisting of an innovation term processing its own new measurement, a consensus term taking a weighted sum of estimations of its own and its neighbors with additive and multiplicative communication noises and a regularization term preventing over-fitting. It is not required that the regression matrices and graphs satisfy special statistical assumptions such as mutual independence, spatio-temporal independence or stationarity. We develop the nonnegative supermartingale inequality of the estimation error, and prove that the estimations of all nodes converge to the unknown true parameter vector almost surely if the algorithm gains, graphs and regression matrices jointly satisfy the sample path spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition. Especially, this condition holds by choosing appropriate algorithm gains ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在随机时变图上的分散在线正则化线性回归算法。在每个时间步中，每个节点都运行一个在线估计算法，该算法包括创新项（处理自身新测量值）、共识项（加权平均自身及其邻居的估计，带有加性和乘性通信噪声）和正则化项（防止过度拟合）。不要求回归矩阵和图满足特殊的统计假设，如相互独立、时空独立或平稳性。我们发展了非负超-鞅不等式的估计误差，并证明了如果算法增益、图和回归矩阵共同满足样本路径时空兴奋条件，节点的估计几乎可以肯定地收敛于未知的真实参数向量。特别地，通过选择适当的算法增益，该条件成立。",
