    "translated_abstract": "机器学习中的一个未解问题是任何VC维度$d$的集合族是否接受大小为$O(d)$的样本压缩方案。本文研究了图中球的这个问题。对于图$G=(V,E)$中的一个球$B=B_r(x)$，球$B$的一个可实现样本是$V$的一个有符号子集$X=(X^+,X^-)$，使得$B$包含$X^+$且与$X^-$不相交。大小为$k$的适当样本压缩方案包括一个压缩器和一个重构器。压缩器将任何可实现样本$X$映射为大小最多为$k$的子样本$X'$。重构器将这样的子样本$X'$映射为$G$的球$B'$，使得$B'$包括$X^+$并且与$X^-$不相交。对于任意半径$r$的球，我们设计了树的大小为$2$的适当标记样本压缩方案，环的大小为$3$，区间图的大小为$4$，环树的大小为$6$，以及自由立方体中位图的大小为$22$。",
