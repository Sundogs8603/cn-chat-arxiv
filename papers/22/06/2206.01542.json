    "translated_abstract": "重度抑郁症是一个普遍存在、伴随高昂社会经济成本的全球性心理健康问题。预测和自动检测重度抑郁症可以对社会产生巨大影响。言语作为一种非侵入性、易于收集的信号，是辅助诊断和评估重度抑郁症的有希望标记。本文收集了RADAR-MDD研究计划中作为一部分的言语样本。RADAR-MDD是一个观察性队列研究，其中收集了西班牙、英国和荷兰有抑郁症史的个人的言语和其他数字生物标志物。本文将RADAR-MDD言语语料库作为实验框架，测试了一种具有本地注意机制的序列到序列模型在两类抑郁症严重程度分类范式中的有效性。此外，本文提出了一种新的训练方法HARD-Training。",
