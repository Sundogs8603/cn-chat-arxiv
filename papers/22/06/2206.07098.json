    "abstract": "The metric distortion framework posits that n voters and m candidates are jointly embedded in a metric space such that voters rank candidates that are closer to them higher. A voting rule's purpose is to pick a candidate with minimum total distance to the voters, given only the rankings, but not the actual distances. As a result, in the worst case, each deterministic rule picks a candidate whose total distance is at least three times larger than that of an optimal one, i.e., has distortion at least 3. A recent breakthrough result showed that achieving this bound of 3 is possible; however, the proof is non-constructive, and the voting rule itself is a complicated exhaustive search.  Our main result is an extremely simple voting rule, called Plurality Veto, which achieves the same optimal distortion of 3. Each candidate starts with a score equal to his number of first-place votes. These scores are then gradually decreased via an n-round veto process in which a candidate drops out when hi",

    "translated_abstract": "度量畸变框架假设n个选民和m个候选人共同嵌入在一个度量空间中，选民按照离他们更近的候选人进行排名。一个投票规则的目的是在只知道排名而不知道实际距离的情况下选择一个与选民的总距离最小的候选人。结果是，在最坏情况下，每个确定性规则选择的候选人的总距离至少是最优规则的三倍，即具有至少3的度量畸变。最近的突破性结果表明，实现这个3的界限是可能的；然而，证明是非构造性的，并且投票规则本身是一个复杂的穷举搜索。我们的主要结果是一种非常简单的投票规则，称为多数否决制，它实现了相同的最优畸变度为3。每个候选人的得分开始等于他的第一名选票数。然后通过一个n轮的否决过程逐渐降低这些得分，在此过程中，候选人在其得票数达到n的一半时退出。",
