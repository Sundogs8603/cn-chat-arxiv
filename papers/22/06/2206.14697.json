    "translated_abstract": "递归状态空间模型(RSSMs)是一种高度表达性的模型，用于学习时间序列数据和系统识别中的模式。然而，这些模型假设动力学是固定且不变的，而这在真实世界的场景中很少见。许多控制应用通常展示出具有类似但非完全相同的动力学的任务，可以将其建模为潜在变量。我们引入了隐性参数的递归状态空间模型(HiP-RSSMs)，这是一种将一系列相关动力系统参数化为低维潜在因子的框架。我们提出了一种简单有效的学习和推断高斯图模型的方法，避免了类似变分推断的近似方法。我们展示了HiP-RSSMs在多个具有挑战性的机器人基准测试中，无论是在真实系统还是模拟中，都优于RSSMs和竞争的多任务模型。",
