    "translated_abstract": "歧义是自然语言现象，在不同的语法、语义和语用层面上发生。它得到了广泛的研究；例如，在心理语言学领域，我们有多种竞争性的研究人类消歧过程的方法。这些研究是经验性的，基于眼动跟踪等测量方法。本文首次尝试为语义歧义形式化这些进程，其中我们确定了两个特征：(1)不同可能解释之间的联合可信度，(2)根据某些词在过程中扮演更重要角色的因果结构。Gogioso和Pinzani在QPL 2021中提出的新型束理论确定因果性模型并对这些特征进行推理提供了工具。我们将这个理论应用于从心理语言学文献中提取的歧义短语数据集和我们使用Amazon的机械土耳其引擎收集的人类可信度判断中。我们测量了其中的因果关系、歧义水平等。",
