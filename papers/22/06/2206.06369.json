    "translated_abstract": "为了应对气候变化，可再生能源在电力生产中的份额需要增加。可再生能源引入了新的挑战，涉及到电网的动态稳定性，包括分散化、降低的惯性和生产的波动性。由于对于大型电网而言，动态稳定性模拟是棘手且极其昂贵的，图神经网络（GNN）是一个有希望的方法，可以减少分析电网动态稳定性的计算工作量。作为GNN模型的测试平台，我们生成了新的、大型的合成电网动态稳定性数据集，并将其作为开源资源提供给研究界。我们发现，仅凭拓扑信息，GNN能够出奇地有效地预测高度非线性的目标。首次实现了适用于实际应用的性能。此外，我们展示了这些模型准确识别电网中特定脆弱节点的能力。",
