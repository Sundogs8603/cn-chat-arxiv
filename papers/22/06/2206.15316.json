    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种用于心脏超声视频的新颖异常检测方法。该方法利用心脏周期性的特性，学习三种变分潜在轨迹模型（TVAE）的变体。其中前两种变体（TVAE-C和TVAE-R）模拟心脏的严格周期性运动，而第三种变体（TVAE-S）更为通用，允许视频中空间表示的移位。所有模型都在一个新的内部婴儿心脏超声视频数据集的健康样本上进行训练，以学习健康人群的规范先验知识。在推断过程中，我们使用基于最大后验概率（MAP）的异常检测来检测数据集中的离群样本。所提出的方法可可靠地识别严重的先天性心脏缺陷，如埃普斯坦异常或Shone综合征。此外，相比于基于标准变分自动编码器的MAP-based异常检测，它实现了更优异的性能。",
