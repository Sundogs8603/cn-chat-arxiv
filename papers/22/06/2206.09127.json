    "abstract": "The modeling and uncertainty quantification of closed curves is an important problem in the field of shape analysis, and can have significant ramifications for subsequent statistical tasks. Many of these tasks involve collections of closed curves, which often exhibit structural similarities at multiple levels. Modeling multiple closed curves in a way that efficiently incorporates such between-curve dependence remains a challenging problem. In this work, we propose and investigate a multiple-output (a.k.a. multi-output), multi-dimensional Gaussian process modeling framework. We illustrate the proposed methodological advances, and demonstrate the utility of meaningful uncertainty quantification, on several curve and shape-related tasks. This model-based approach not only addresses the problem of inference on closed curves (and their shapes) with kernel constructions, but also opens doors to nonparametric modeling of multi-level dependence for functional objects in general.",

    "translated_abstract": "闭合曲线的建模和不确定性量化是形状分析领域中的一个重要问题，并且可能对随后的统计任务产生重大影响。许多这些任务涉及到多个闭合曲线的集合，这些集合通常在多个层面上展现出结构上的相似性。以一种能够高效地纳入这种曲线之间依赖关系的方式对多条闭曲线进行建模仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。在这项工作中，我们提出并研究了一种多输出(也称为多输出)、多维高斯过程建模框架。我们展示了所提出的方法论进展，并证明了在几个曲线和形状相关任务上有着有意义的不确定性量化的效用。这种基于模型的方法不仅通过内核构造解决了对闭合曲线(以及它们的形状)的推理问题，而且还为一般的功能对象的多级依赖关系的非参数建模打开了大门。",
