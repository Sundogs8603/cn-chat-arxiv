In this work, we propose a novel framework PCDF(Parallel-Computing Distributed Framework), allowing to split the computation cost into three parts and to deploy them in the pre-module in parallel with the retrieval stage, the middle-module for ranking ads, and the post-module for re-ranking ads with external items. Our PCDF effectively reduces the overall inference latency compared with the classic framework. The whole module is end-to-end offline ",

    "translated_abstract": "传统的赞助搜索在线广告系统遵循级联范式，包括检索、预排序和排序。由于在线推断效率的严格要求，很难在排序阶段部署有用但计算密集的模块。此外，目前在行业中使用的排序模型假设用户点击仅依赖于广告本身，这导致排名阶段忽视了有机搜索结果对预测广告的影响。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新颖的框架PCDF（并行计算分布式框架），允许将计算成本分为三个部分，并将它们与检索阶段并行部署在预处理模块、广告排序模块和重新排序模块中。与经典框架相比，我们的PCDF有效降低了整体推断延迟。整个模块是端到端离线的。",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一个名为PCDF的并行计算分布式框架，用于赞助搜索广告服务。该框架通过将计算分为预处理模块、广告排序模块和重新排序模块，有效降低了推断延迟，同时考虑了有机搜索结果对广告排序的影响。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a parallel-computing distributed framework called PCDF for sponsored search advertising serving. The framework reduces inference latency by splitting the computation into pre-processing, ad ranking, and re-ranking stages while considering the impact of organic search results on ad ranking."
