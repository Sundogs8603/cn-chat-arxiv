    "translated_abstract": "图神经架构搜索（GraphNAS）最近在学术界和工业界引起了相当大的关注。然而，两个关键挑战严重阻碍了对GraphNAS的进一步研究。首先，由于实验设置没有共识，不同研究论文中的实验结果通常不可比较，甚至不可重复，导致不公平的比较。其次，GraphNAS通常需要大量计算，这使其高度低效且不易访问，限制了没有大规模计算资源的研究人员。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了NAS-Bench-Graph，这是一个定制的基准测试，支持对GraphNAS进行统一、可复现和高效的评估。具体来说，我们构建了一个统一、表达力丰富而紧凑的搜索空间，涵盖了26,206种独特的图神经网络（GNN）架构，并提出了一个有原则的评估协议。",
