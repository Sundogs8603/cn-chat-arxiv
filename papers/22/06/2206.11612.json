To analyze the health consumer-generated content (HCGC) from the OHCs, identifying the colloquial medical expressions used by laypeople is a critical challenge. The open-access and collaborative consumer health vocabulary (OAC CHV) is the controlled vocabulary for addressing such a challenge.

    "translated_abstract": "在线健康社区（OHC）是普通人分享健康信息的主要渠道。为了分析OHC中消费者生成内容（HCGC），识别普通人使用的口头医学表达是一个关键挑战。开放获取和协作的消费者健康词汇（OAC CHV）是应对这一挑战的受控词汇。然而，OAC CHV仅在英语中可用，限制了其在其他语言中的适用性。本研究提出了一个跨语言自动术语识别框架，用于将英语CHV扩展为跨语言CHV。我们的框架需要一个英语HCGC语料库和一个非英语（本研究中为中文）HCGC语料库作为输入。使用skip-gram算法确定了两个单语词向量空间，使得每个空间编码了语言内普通人之间的常见词关联。根据等距假设，该研究提出了一种评估两种语言之间映射关系的方法。",
