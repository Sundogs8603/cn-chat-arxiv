    "translated_abstract": "我们首次建立了关于多样化指数的公理化理论，使用了六个直观的公设：非负、位置不变性、尺度不变性、合理性、归一化和连续性。满足这些公设的唯一类别指数被称为多样化商数（DQs），并且基于一个参数化的风险度量族来定义。进一步的一个公设的投资组合凸性将DQ固定在基于一致风险度量的特征上。DQ具有许多有吸引力的属性，它可以解决现有指数的几个理论和实践上的局限性。特别是，对于流行的风险度量Value-at-Risk和Expected Shortfall，相应的DQ具有简单的公式，并且在组合选择中优化起来非常高效。此外，它能够正确捕捉尾部的厚重性和共同冲击，这是传统多样化指数所忽视的。当结合金融数据进行说明时，DQ有直观的解释性，其性能能够很好地对应风险的耐受程度。",
