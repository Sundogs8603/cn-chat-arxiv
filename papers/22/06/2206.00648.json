    "translated_abstract": "比特币以其不断增长的受欢迎程度展示了自其诞生以来的极端价格波动性。这种波动性，加上其去中心化的性质，使比特币相对于更传统的资产更容易受到投机交易的影响。本文提出了一种用于预测极端价格波动的多模态模型。该模型将各种相关资产、技术指标以及Twitter内容作为输入。在一项深入研究中，我们探讨了来自大众对比特币的社交媒体讨论是否具有极端价格波动的预测能力。我们收集了从2015年到2021年每天包含关键词“比特币”的5,000条推文的数据集，称为PreBit，并将其在网上提供。在我们的混合模型中，我们使用在金融词汇表上预训练的句级FinBERT嵌入，以便以可理解的方式捕捉推文的全部内容并将其提供给模型。通过将这些嵌入与一种卷积层结合起来，我们可以提取推文的特征信息，并在模型中进行极端价格波动的预测。",
