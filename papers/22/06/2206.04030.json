    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在高维极限下，具有恒定步长的随机梯度下降（SGD）的可扩展极限。我们证明了SGD的总结统计轨迹（即有限维函数）在维度趋于无穷大时的极限定理。我们的方法允许选择要跟踪的总结统计量、初始化和步长。它产生了一个在前述选择上极其依赖的球形（ODE）和扩散（SDE）极限。我们展示了步长的临界尺度，低于这个尺度，有效的球形动力学与人口损失的梯度流相匹配，但在这个尺度上，出现了一个新的修正项，改变了相图。关于这个有效动力学的不动点，相应的扩散极限可能非常复杂甚至退化。我们在一些流行的例子上展示了我们的方法，包括尖峰矩阵和张量模型的估计以及通过两层网络进行分类。",
