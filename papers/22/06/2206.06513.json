    "translated_abstract": "具有非平凡大规模拓扑结构的数据集可能很难用现有的降维算法嵌入到低维欧几里得空间中。我们提出使用向量丛来模拟具有拓扑复杂性的数据集，这样基空间可以考虑到大规模拓扑，而纤维可以考虑到局部几何。这允许我们降低纤维的维度，同时保留大规模拓扑结构。我们形式化了这个观点，并作为一个应用，我们提出了一个算法，该算法将数据集及其在欧几里得空间中的初始表示作为输入，假设它能恢复部分大规模拓扑结构，并输出一个新表示，该表示将局部线性降维得到的局部表示与初始全局表示相结合。我们在动力学系统和化学领域的例子中证明了这个算法。在这些例子中，我们的算法能够学习拓扑结构和几何结构之间的联系。",
