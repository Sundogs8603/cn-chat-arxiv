    "translated_abstract": "轴承是旋转机械的重要组件之一，容易出现意外故障。因此，轴承故障诊断和状态监测对于减少多个行业的运营成本和停机时间至关重要。在各种生产条件下，轴承可以在不同的负载和转速下运行，这会导致与每种故障类型相关的不同振动模式。正常数据很充足，因为系统通常在预期的条件下工作。另一方面，故障数据很少，并且在许多情况下，没有记录故障类别的数据。获取故障数据对于开发数据驱动的故障诊断工具至关重要，可提高操作的性能和安全性。因此，引入了一种基于有条件生成对抗网络（CGANs）的新算法。该算法在任何实际故障条件下使用正常数据和故障数据进行训练，可以从目标条件的正常数据中生成对应的故障数据。该方法包括两个阶段：特征提取阶段和故障合成阶段。首先，从源条件的正常数据中提取故障特征，然后利用这些特征使用改进的CGAN生成与目标条件相应的故障数据。实验在滚动轴承的模拟数据集和实验数据集上进行。结果表明，该方法能够成功地在新条件下生成滚动轴承的故障样本，并在检测故障类型方面提供高准确度。",
