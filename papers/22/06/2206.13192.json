    "abstract": "There is a rapid increase in the cooperative learning paradigm in online learning settings, i.e., federated learning (FL). Unlike most FL settings, there are many situations where the agents are competitive. Each agent would like to learn from others, but the part of the information it shares for others to learn from could be sensitive; thus, it desires its privacy. This work investigates a group of agents working concurrently to solve similar combinatorial bandit problems while maintaining quality constraints. Can these agents collectively learn while keeping their sensitive information confidential by employing differential privacy? We observe that communicating can reduce the regret. However, differential privacy techniques for protecting sensitive information makes the data noisy and may deteriorate than help to improve regret. Hence, we note that it is essential to decide when to communicate and what shared data to learn to strike a functional balance between regret and privacy. F",

    "translated_abstract": "在在线学习模式中，合作学习范式（即联邦学习）快速增长。与大多数联邦学习情景不同的是，有很多情况下代理是竞争的。每个代理都想从其他人那里学习，但它分享给其他人学习的信息有可能是敏感的，因此它需要隐私。本文研究了一组代理同时解决类似的组合赌博机问题，同时保持质量约束。这些代理是否可以通过采用差分隐私来保持机密性，集体学习？我们观察到通信可以降低后悔。但是，保护敏感信息的差分隐私技术使数据变得很嘈杂，可能会恶化而不是有帮助地提高后悔。因此，我们指出决定何时通信以及学习哪些共享数据来在后悔和隐私之间实现功能平衡至关重要。",
