    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型何时预测个体的未来，何时重复预先存在的模式？在这项工作中，我们提出了对这两种预测路径进行区分，这一提议得到了理论、经验和规范性论证的支持。我们提出的核心是一类简单高效的统计测试，称为“向后基线”，可以展示模型是否以及在何种程度上重新讲述了过去。我们的统计理论为解释向后基线提供了指导，并建立了不同基线和熟悉统计概念之间的等价关系。具体而言，我们推导了一个有意义的向后基线，可以对预测系统进行审计，即使只提供了背景变量和系统的预测。在经验上，我们在从纵向面板调查中衍生出的不同预测任务上评估了该框架，展示了将其纳入的便捷性和有效性。",
