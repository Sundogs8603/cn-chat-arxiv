    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶车辆除了标准相机外，通常还包括多个其他传感器，如激光雷达和雷达，这些传感器帮助获取感知驾驶场景的更丰富信息。虽然最近有几项工作着重于将某些传感器对进行融合，如相机与激光雷达或雷达，但缺乏一种通用且模块化的传感器融合架构。在本文中，我们提出了HRFuser，一种多模态二维物体检测的模块化架构。它以多分辨率方式融合多个传感器并可扩展到任意数量的输入模式。HRFuser的设计基于用于仅图像密集预测的最先进高分辨率网络，并采用新型的多窗口交叉注意力块作为执行多模态多分辨率融合的手段。通过对nuScenes和恶劣条件DENSE进行的大量实验，我们证明了HRFuser的有效性。",
