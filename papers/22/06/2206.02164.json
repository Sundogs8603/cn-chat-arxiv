    "translated_abstract": "路边空间是城市道路网络中最繁忙的区域之一。特别是近年来，网约车和商业配送的快速增长导致了大量的取货和送货（PUDOs），这些占据了几十年前设计建造的有限路边空间。这些PUDOs可能导致路边利用率的拥堵和干扰主线交通流，明显带来显著的负面社会外部性。然而，目前缺乏一个严格量化和减轻PUDOs拥堵影响的分析框架，尤其是缺乏数据支持和混淆效应的参与。为了填补这一研究空白，本文采用严格的因果推断方法，评估PUDOs对一般区域网络的拥堵影响。建立了一个因果图来表示PUDOs和交通速度之间的时空关系，并提出了一种双重和分离的机器学习（DSML）方法来量化PUDOs对交通速度的影响。",
