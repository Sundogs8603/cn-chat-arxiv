    "abstract": "In recent years, deep generative models have attracted increasing interest due to their capacity to model complex distributions. Among those models, variational autoencoders have gained popularity as they have proven both to be computationally efficient and yield impressive results in multiple fields. Following this breakthrough, extensive research has been done in order to improve the original publication, resulting in a variety of different VAE models in response to different tasks. In this paper we present Pythae, a versatile open-source Python library providing both a unified implementation and a dedicated framework allowing straightforward, reproducible and reliable use of generative autoencoder models. We then propose to use this library to perform a case study benchmark where we present and compare 19 generative autoencoder models representative of some of the main improvements on downstream tasks such as image reconstruction, generation, classification, clustering and interpola",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度生成模型因其对复杂分布的建模能力而引起越来越多的关注。在这些模型中，变分自编码器因其在计算上的高效性和在多个领域中产生令人印象深刻的结果而受到广泛关注。在这一突破之后，为了改进原始论文已进行了广泛的研究工作，导致了各种不同的变分自编码器模型以应对不同的任务。本文介绍了Pythae，一个通用的开源Python库，提供了统一的实现和专门的框架，可方便、可重现、可靠地使用生成自编码器模型。然后，我们提出使用该库进行案例研究基准测试，在其中展示并比较了19个生成自编码器模型，这些模型代表了在图像重构、生成、分类、聚类和插值等下游任务上的一些主要改进。",
