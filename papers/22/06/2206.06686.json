    "translated_abstract": "在某些特定的情况下，量子计算机已被证明在机器学习领域中具有超越经典状态的速度优势。例如，已经证明，量子核方法在离散对数问题的学习版本上提供指数级的加速。了解量子模型的普适性对于实现类似的问题速度优势至关重要。最近的研究结果表明，由于量子特征空间的指数级大小，普适性受到阻碍。尽管这些结果表明，当量子比特数很大时，量子模型无法普适化，但本文表明，这些结果基于过于严格的假设。我们通过改变称为量子核带宽的超参数来考虑更广泛的模型类。我们分析大量比特极限并提供了可以用闭合形式解决的量子模型的普适化的明确公式。具体来说，我们表明改变量子核带宽的值可以使量子模型普适化。",
