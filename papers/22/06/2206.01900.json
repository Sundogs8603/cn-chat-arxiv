    "translated_abstract": "在各种工程和科学领域中，评估多智能体系统中的干预行为（例如，人类何时应该干预自动驾驶系统，何时球员应该传给队友进行好射门）是一项具有挑战性的任务。使用反事实的长期预测来估计个体治疗效果（ITE）是评估此类干预措施的实用方法。然而，大多数传统框架没有考虑到多智能体关系的时间变化和协变量反事实预测的复杂结构，这可能导致ITE的错误评估和解释困难。在这里，我们提出了一个可解释的反事实循环网络，用于估计干预的效果。我们的模型利用图形变分循环神经网络和基于领域知识的计算来进行基于多智能体协变量和结果的长期预测的ITE估计框架，能够确认循环结构。",
