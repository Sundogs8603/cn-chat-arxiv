    "translated_abstract": "DBSCAN广泛应用于基于密度的聚类算法。然而，随着对多密度聚类需求的增加，传统DBSCAN无法在多密度数据集上取得良好的聚类结果。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种自适应多密度DBSCAN算法（AMD-DBSCAN）。在AMD-DBSCAN中提出了一种改进的参数适应方法，用于搜索多个参数对（即Eps和MinPts），这些参数对确定了聚类结果和性能，因此允许模型应用于多密度数据集。此外，AMD-DBSCAN只需要一个超参数，避免了复杂的重复初始化操作。此外，提出了邻居数量方差（VNN）来衡量每个簇之间的密度差异。实验结果表明，我们的AMD-DBSCAN由于较低的算法复杂性将执行时间平均降低了75％。",
