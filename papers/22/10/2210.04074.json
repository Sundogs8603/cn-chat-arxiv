    "translated_abstract": "自然语言以不同的细粒度表达事件，其中粗粒度事件（目标）可以细分为更细粒度的事件序列（步骤）。理解事件过程的一个关键但常被忽视的方面是认识到并非所有步骤事件对于完成目标具有相同的重要性。本文通过研究当前模型理解与目标事件有关的步骤事件的重要性的程度来填补这一空白。认知研究表明，这种能力使机器能够模拟人类对日常任务的先决条件和必要努力的常识推理。我们贡献了一个优质的语料库（目标，步骤）对，该语料库从社区指南网站WikiHow收集，通过专家手动注释步骤的重要性。高一致性的标注者间一致性表明人类对事件重要性具有一致的理解。然而，在评估多个统计模型之后，我们发现当前的模型在理解步骤的重要性方面还存在困难。",
