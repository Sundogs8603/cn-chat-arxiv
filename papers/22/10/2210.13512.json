    "translated_abstract": "Mixup 是一种数据增强技术，依赖于使用数据点和标签的随机凸组合进行训练。近年来，Mixup 已成为训练最先进的图像分类模型的标准基元，因为它在泛化和鲁棒性方面比经验风险最小化有明显的优势。在这项工作中，我们试图从特征学习的角度解释一些这种成功。我们关注的分类问题是，每个类别可能具有多个相关特征（或视图），可用于正确预测类别。我们的主要理论结果表明，在具有每类两个特征的一类非平凡数据分布中，使用经验风险最小化训练 2 层卷积网络可能会导致几乎所有类别只学习一个特征，而使用 Mixup 的特定实例进行训练可以成功地学习每个类别的两个特征。",
