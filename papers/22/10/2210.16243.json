Weak gravitational lensing sourced by the most massive structures in the Universe generates a slight shearing of galaxy morphologies called cosmic shear, key probe for cosmological models. Modern techniques of shear estimation based on statistics of ellipticity measurements suffer from the fact that the ellipticity is not a well-defined quantity for arbitrary galaxy light profiles, biasing the shear estimation. We show that a hybrid physical and deep learning Hierarchical Bayesian Model, where a generative model captures the galaxy morphology, enables us to recover an unbiased estimate of the shear on realistic galaxies, thus solving the model bias.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着现代星系调查的规模和质量增加，测量嵌入星系形状中的宇宙学信号的难度也增加。由宇宙中最庞大结构引发的弱引力透镜效应会产生微小的星系形态剪切，称为余辉，是研究宇宙模型的重要探测手段。基于椭圆度测量统计的现代剪切估计技术存在一个问题，即椭圆度对于任意星系光度轮廓并不是一个明确定义的量，从而产生剪切估计偏差。我们展示了一种混合物理和深度学习的分层贝叶斯模型，在这种模型中，生成模型捕捉了星系的形态，使我们能够在真实星系上恢复出无偏估计的剪切，从而解决了模型偏差问题。",
