    "abstract": "The main purpose of this study is to develop a pipeline for COVID-19 detection from a big and challenging database of Computed Tomography (CT) images. The proposed pipeline includes a segmentation part, a lung extraction part, and a classifier part. Optional slice removal techniques after UNet-based segmentation of slices were also tried. The methodologies tried in the segmentation part are traditional segmentation methods as well as UNet-based methods. In the classification part, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used to take the final diagnosis decisions. In terms of the results: in the segmentation part, the proposed segmentation methods show high dice scores on a publicly available dataset. In the classification part, the results were compared at slice-level and at patient-level as well. At slice-level, methods were compared and showed high validation accuracy indicating efficiency in predicting 2D slices. At patient level, the proposed methods were also compared in terms of",
