    "abstract": "People are known to judge artificial intelligence using a utilitarian moral philosophy and humans using a moral philosophy emphasizing perceived intentions. But why do people judge humans and machines differently? Psychology suggests that people may have different mind perception models of humans and machines, and thus, will treat human-like robots more similarly to the way they treat humans. Here we present a randomized experiment where we manipulated people's perception of machine agency (e.g., ability to plan, act) and experience (e.g., ability to feel) to explore whether people judge machines that are perceived to be more similar to humans along these two dimensions more similarly to the way they judge humans. We find that people's judgments of machines become more similar to that of humans when they perceive machines as having more agency but not more experience. Our findings indicate that people's use of different moral philosophies to judge humans and machines can be explained b",

    "translated_abstract": "人们已知使用功利主义的道德哲学来评判人工智能，而使用强调被感知意图的道德哲学来评判人类。但为什么人们对人类和机器的判断不同呢？心理学认为人们对人类和机器可能有不同的心理感知模型，因此，他们会把类人机器更像对待人类的方式对待。在这里，我们通过一个随机实验来探索人们如何判断那些在代理（例如，规划和行动能力）和经验（例如，感知能力）上与人类更相似的机器。我们发现，当人们感知机器具有更多代理能力时，他们对机器的评判更接近于对人类的评判，但并不受经验的影响。我们的研究结果表明，人们对人类和机器使用不同的道德哲学进行判断可以得到解释。",
