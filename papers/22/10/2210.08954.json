    "translated_abstract": "智能合约是一种包含自然语言和可计算组件的数字化协议。Accord Project 提供了一个开源的智能合约框架，包含三个主要模块：Cicero、Concerto和Ergo。目前，我们需要律师、程序员和客户共同努力才能使用 Accord Project 创建可用的智能合约。本文提出了一个流程，利用多个自然语言处理模型将法律合同转换为 Accord Project 的 Concerto 模型，以自动化智能合约的创建过程。在评估了提出的流程后，我们发现我们的 NER 流程可以正确识别 Accord Project 模板文本中的 CiceroMark，准确率达到0.8。此外，我们的问答方法可以从模板文本中提取出三分之一的 Concerto 变量。我们还深入探讨了提出的流程的一些局限性和可能的未来研究。最后，我们描述了一个 Web 接口，使用户可以构建智能合约。",
