    "translated_abstract": "尽管深度神经网络在图像识别任务中表现出色，但观察到它们容易受到通用对抗干扰 (UAPs) 的影响，这些干扰使用单个扰动向量干扰所有输入样本。然而，UAPs在跨DNN架构转移时通常很困难并导致挑战性优化问题。本文研究了UAP的可Transfer性，通过分析分类器和UAP对手玩家之间在通用对抗示例博弈中的均衡情况。我们表明，在温和的假设下，通用对抗示例博弈缺乏一个纯纳什均衡，这表明UAPs在DNN分类器之间的转移性是次优的。针对这个问题，我们提出了通用对抗方向 (UADs)，只固定对抗干扰的通用方向，允许跨样本自由选择干扰的幅度。我们证明，UAD对抗示例博弈可以具有纳什均衡且该均衡状态纯。",
