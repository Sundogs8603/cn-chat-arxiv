For example, on a mining shovel or conveyor belt, rocks are constantly moving (leading to varying angles of incidence and distances) and there may be other factors not accounted for (like dust). Neural networks do not require instrument and fundamental parameters but training neural networks requires XRF spectra labelled with elemental composition, which is often limited because of its expense. We develop a neural network model that learns from limited labelled data and also benefits from domain knowledge by learning to invert a forward model. The forward model uses transition energies and probabilities of all elements and parameterized distributions to approximate other fundamental and instrument parameters. We evaluate the model and baseline models on a rock dataset from a lithium mineral exploration project. ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对能量色散X射线荧光（EDXRF）应用中因仪器参数不可用而无法使用基本参数方法的情况进行研究。例如，在采矿铲车或传送带上，岩石不断移动（导致入射角度和距离不断变化），还可能存在其他未考虑的因素（如灰尘）。神经网络不需要仪器和基本参数，但训练神经网络需要带有元素组成标签的XRF光谱，由于成本限制，这种标签数据通常很有限。本研究开发了一个神经网络模型，可以从有限的标记数据中学习，并通过学习反演正演模型来受益于领域知识。正演模型使用所有元素的跃迁能量和概率以及参数分布来逼近其他基本和仪器参数。我们使用来自锂矿勘探项目的岩石数据集评估了该模型和基线模型。",
