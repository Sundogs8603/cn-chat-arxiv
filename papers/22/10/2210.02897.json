    "translated_abstract": "本研究设计了一个可扩展且计算效率高的框架，用于提取实际蓝牙设备的指纹。我们提出了一种嵌入式注意力框架（Mbed-ATN），适用于获取实际蓝牙设备的指纹。我们分析了其在不同环境中的泛化能力，并演示了样本长度和抗混叠抽取的效果。嵌入式模块作为降维单元，将高维的三维输入张量映射为一维特征向量，供ATN模块进一步处理。此外，我们对该模型的复杂性进行了密切评估，并在训练后使用另一个在不同时段和实验设置下收集的真实蓝牙数据集测试了其指纹能力，这是该领域先前研究所没有做过的。研究表明，在样本长度为100 kS时，与基准——GRU和Oracle模型相比，我们的模型内存使用量分别降低了9.17倍和65.2倍。此外，所提出的Mbed-ATN在室内和室外环境中均实现了较高的分类准确率，分别为99.4％和97.4％。",
