    "translated_abstract": "神经网络已被证明利用与目标标签共现的错误假象（或捷径）来展示启发式记忆。另一方面，网络已被证明会记忆训练样本，产生基于示例的记忆。这些记忆类型阻碍了网络在超出训练分布的泛化能力。检测此类记忆可能具有挑战性，通常需要研究人员策划定制的测试集。在这项工作中，我们假设——并随后展示了——不同神经元激活模式的多样性反映了模型的泛化和记忆。我们通过信息论度量量化神经激活的多样性，并在涵盖了几个自然语言和视觉任务的实验中得到了对我们假设的支持。重要的是，我们发现信息的组织指向了这两种形式的记忆，即使是在未标记的分布内部计算的神经激活上也是如此。",

The experiments demonstrate that even for neural activations computed on unlabelled distributions, the organization of information can indicate the two forms of memorization."
