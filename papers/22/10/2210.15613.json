    "translated_abstract": "一价定律（LOP）广泛断言相同的金融流应该获取相同的价格。我们展示了当适当地制定时，LOP是一个明确均值方差组合配置框架而不会退化的最小条件。关键是，本文确定了一个新机制，即在连续时间$L^2(P)$情景下，在没有摩擦的情况下，“在可预测停时之前进行交易”，这出人意料地揭示了连续价格过程中一价定律的违规。关闭这个漏洞允许在二次上下文中给出“资产定价基本定理”的一个版本，建立了LOP经济概念和存在本地$\\scr{E}$-鞅态密度的概率性特性之间的等价性。后者为扩展市场中所有平方可积的待定索赔提供唯一的价格，并在均值方差组合选择中发挥重要作用。",
