    "abstract": "Recently, amounts of works utilize perplexity~(PPL) to evaluate the quality of the generated text. They suppose that if the value of PPL is smaller, the quality(i.e. fluency) of the text to be evaluated is better. However, we find that the PPL referee is unqualified and it cannot evaluate the generated text fairly for the following reasons: (i) The PPL of short text is larger than long text, which goes against common sense, (ii) The repeated text span could damage the performance of PPL, and (iii) The punctuation marks could affect the performance of PPL heavily. Experiments show that the PPL is unreliable for evaluating the quality of given text. Last, we discuss the key problems with evaluating text quality using language models.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，很多研究都使用困惑度（PPL）来评估生成文本的质量。他们认为，如果 PPL 的值越小，被评估文本的质量（即流畅性）就越好。然而，我们发现 PPL 双重错误，不能公正地评估生成文本的质量，原因包括：（i）短文本的 PPL 值大于长文本，这与常识相悖，（ii）重复文本段落状态下可以损坏 PPL，（iii）标点符号可以严重影响 PPL 的表现。实验表明，PPL 不能可靠地评估给定文本的质量。最后，我们讨论了使用语言模型评估文本质量的关键问题。",
    "tldr": "该研究发现，使用困惑度指标评估生成文本质量是不可靠的，由于短文本 PPL 值高于长文本，重复文本段落和标点符号也可以损坏指标表现。 使用语言模型评估文本质量应谨慎。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study found that using perplexity measurement to evaluate the quality of generated text is unreliable due to the fact that the PPL value of short texts is higher than that of long texts, and that repeated text and punctuation can also affect the metric. It suggests that evaluating text quality using language models should be approached with caution."
