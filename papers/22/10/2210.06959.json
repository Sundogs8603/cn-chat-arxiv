    "abstract": "In the past two decades, most research on anomaly detection has focused on improving the accuracy of the detection, while largely ignoring the explainability of the corresponding methods and thus leaving the explanation of outcomes to practitioners. As anomaly detection algorithms are increasingly used in safety-critical domains, providing explanations for the high-stakes decisions made in those domains has become an ethical and regulatory requirement. Therefore, this work provides a comprehensive and structured survey on state-of-the-art explainable anomaly detection techniques. We propose a taxonomy based on the main aspects that characterize each explainable anomaly detection technique, aiming to help practitioners and researchers find the explainable anomaly detection method that best suits their needs.",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的二十年中，大部分关于异常检测的研究都集中在提高检测的准确性上，而很大程度上忽视了相应方法的可解释性，因此将结果的解释留给了实践者。由于异常检测算法越来越广泛地应用于安全关键领域，在这些领域做出的高风险决策需要提供解释已成为一项道德和监管要求。因此，本研究对最先进的可解释异常检测技术进行了全面和结构化的调查。我们提出了一个基于每种可解释异常检测技术的主要特征的分类法，旨在帮助实践者和研究人员找到最适合他们需求的可解释异常检测方法。",
