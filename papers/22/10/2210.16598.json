    "translated_abstract": "在紧急情况下，精确地预测病人的关键事件发生时间至关重要，而许多使用电子病历(EHR)的自动预测方法由于时间分辨率过粗，限制了它们在急诊科和重症监护室等紧急环境中的实际应用。因此，在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于自监督预测编码和多模态融合的每小时预测方法，用于两个关键任务：死亡率和血管升压药需求预测。通过大量实验，我们证明了多模态融合和自监督预测正则化对性能的显著提升，尤其是在远期预测方面，在实践中变得尤为重要。我们的单模态/双模态/双模态自监督在死亡率(远期死亡率)方面得分分别为0.846/0.877/0.897 (0.824/0.855/0.886)，在血管升压药需求预测方面得分分别为0.817/0.820/0.858 (0.807/0.81/0.855)。",
