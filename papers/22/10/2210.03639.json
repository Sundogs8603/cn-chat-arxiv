    "translated_abstract": "我提出，尽管不同文化之间存在价值观差异，但可以通过在感觉和知觉层面体验生活质量来进行比较。我认为，评估生活质量的方法应该关注个体通过感知环境中积极因素的组合并实现有价值的行为和状态的能力，比直接关注生活手段和自由手段的度量方法更有意义。因为生活质量的感受体验来自构成环境整体结构的一系列因素，所以无法被视为主观体验。通过以眼睛感知不同频率和频率混合物为颜色的示例，我证明了人类的认知装置由于与环境存在关联而可以产生这种体验。",

The objective nature of this experience is demonstrated through the example of perceiving different frequencies and mixtures of frequencies as colors by the eye."
