    "abstract": "Objective: A major challenge in designing closed-loop brain-computer interfaces is finding optimal stimulation patterns as a function of ongoing neural activity for different subjects and objectives. Approach: To achieve goal-directed closed-loop neurostimulation, we propose \"neural co-processors\" which use artificial neural networks and deep learning to learn optimal closed-loop stimulation policies, shaping neural activity and bridging injured neural circuits for targeted repair and rehabilitation. The co-processor adapts the stimulation policy as the biological circuit itself adapts to the stimulation, achieving a form of brain-device co-adaptation. Here we use simulations to lay the groundwork for future in vivo tests of neural co-processors. We leverage a cortical model of grasping, to which we applied various forms of simulated lesions, allowing us to develop the critical learning algorithms and study adaptations to non-stationarity.

    "translated_abstract": "目的：设计闭环脑机接口的一个主要挑战是找到不同受试者和目标的持续神经活动的最佳刺激模式。方法：为了实现目标导向的闭环神经刺激，我们提出了“神经协处理器”，它使用人工神经网络和深度学习来学习最优闭环刺激策略，塑造神经活动和连接受损的神经回路进行有针对性的修复和康复。协处理器随着生物电路自身适应刺激而调整刺激策略，实现了一种脑-设备协同适应形式。在这里，我们使用模拟为神经协处理器的未来体内测试奠定基础。我们利用一个用于抓取的皮层模型，对其应用了各种形式的模拟损伤，从而使我们能够开发关键的学习算法并研究对非稳态的适应性。主要结果：我们的模拟表明，神经协处理器能够从不同的模拟損傷中，学会自适应的闭环刺激策略，并促进神经电路的修复。",
