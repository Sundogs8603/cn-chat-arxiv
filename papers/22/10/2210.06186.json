RTDFs have now made it feasible to replace an imposter's face with their victim in live video interactions. Such advancement in deepfakes also coaxes detection to rise to the same standard. However, existing deepfake detection techniques are asynchronous and hence ill-suited for RTDFs. To bridge this gap, we propose a challenge-response approach that establishes authenticity in live settings. We focus on talking-head style video interaction and present a taxonomy of challenges that specifically target inherent limitations of RTDF generation pipelines. We evaluate representative examples from the taxonomy by collecting a unique dataset comprising eight challenges, which consistently and visibly degrades the quality of state-of-the-art deepfake generators. These results are corroborated both by humans ",

    "translated_abstract": "随着AI-enabled Real-Time Deepfakes（RTDFs）的兴起，在线视频互动的完整性已成为一个日益令人担忧的问题。RTDFs现在使得在实时视频互动中将冒名顶替者的脸替换为其受害者成为可能。这种深度伪造的进步也促使检测达到同样的标准。然而，现有的深度伪造检测技术是异步的，因此不适用于RTDFs。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了一种在实时环境中建立真实性的挑战-响应方法。我们专注于讲话头部风格的视频互动，并提出了一个专门针对RTDF生成管道固有限制的挑战分类。我们通过收集一个包含八个挑战的独特数据集来评估分类中的代表性示例，这些挑战一致和明显地降低了最先进的深度伪造生成器的质量。这些结果得到了人类的证实。",
