    "translated_abstract": "随着近年来具身化人工智能的发展，人们对具身化代理在交互环境中执行更复杂任务的期望越来越高。现有的具身化任务包括具身化指称表达（ERE）和其他问答形式的任务主要关注语言指令方面的交互。因此，使代理能够主动在环境中操纵对象进行探索，成为社区面临的一个挑战性问题。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一个新的具身化任务：远程具身化操纵问题回答（REMQA），将ERE与操纵任务相结合。在REMQA任务中，代理需要导航到远程位置，并对目标对象进行操纵以回答问题。我们在AI2-THOR模拟器中构建了一个用于REMQA任务的基准数据集。为此，提出了一个具备3D语义重建和模块化网络范 paradigm 的框架。介绍了在REMQA数据集上对所提出的框架进行的评估。",
