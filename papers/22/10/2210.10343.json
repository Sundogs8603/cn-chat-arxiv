    "translated_abstract": "数据增强技术被用于缓解各种 NER（扁平、嵌套和不连续的 NER）任务中标注数据稀缺的问题。现有的增强技术要么修改原始文本中的单词从而破坏文本的语义连贯性，要么使用生成模型而忽略携带原始文本中的实体，这阻碍了增广技术在嵌套和不连续的 NER 任务上的使用。本研究提出了一种新的基于实体与文本的数据增强技术（EnTDA），对原始文本中的实体列表进行添加、删除、替换或交换，采用这些增广后的实体列表为各种 NER 任务生成语义连贯和保留实体的文本。此外，我们引入了一个多样性束搜索，以增加文本生成过程中的多样性。在三个任务（扁平、嵌套和不连续 NER 任务）和两个设置（完整数据以及数据稀缺情况下）的十三个 NER 数据集上进行实验。",
