    "translated_abstract": "多智能体学习越来越受到关注，以应对数据交换受限的分布式机器学习场景。然而，现有的多智能体学习模型通常考虑在智能体之间固定强制性的协作关系下的数据融合，这不如人类协作那样灵活和自治。为弥补这一缺口，我们提出了一个受人类协作启发的分布式多智能体学习模型，在该模型中，智能体可以自主检测适合的合作者，并参考合作者的模型以获得更好的性能。为实现这种适应性协作，我们使用协作图来指示成对协作关系。协作图可以通过基于不同智能体之间的模型相似度的图学习技术来获得。由于模型相似性不能通过固定的图形优化来描述，我们设计了一个展开图学习网络，以更适应各种情况地学习潜在合作者之间的相似特征。",
