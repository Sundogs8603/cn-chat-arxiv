    "translated_abstract": "尽管贝叶斯范式提供了一个估计不确定参数整个概率分布的形式框架，但其在线实现由于高计算成本而具有挑战性。我们提出了自适应递归马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（ARMCMC）方法，该方法消除了传统在线技术的缺点，同时计算模型参数的整个概率密度函数。高斯噪声的限制、仅适用于线性参数（LIP）系统以及持续激励（PE）需求是其中的一些缺点。在ARMCMC中，提出了基于时间遗忘因子（TFF）的变量跳跃分布。遗忘因子可以在许多动态系统中用TFF自适应地表示，作为常数超参数的替代选择。通过在开发与探索之间提供权衡，具体的跳跃分布已被优化，以便适应允许推断的混合/多模态系统。",
