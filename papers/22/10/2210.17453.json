    "translated_abstract": "Benkeser等人展示了如何在随机试验中调整基线协变量，从而有意义地提高各种结果类型的精度。他们的研究建立在很长时间的历史基础上，始于1932年的R.A. Fisher，包括美国食品和药物管理局以及欧洲药品管理局最近的认可。本文着重探讨了一个重要的实际问题：如何选择调整方法，即哪些变量以及以何种形式，以最大化精度，同时保持Ⅰ类错误控制。Balzer等人以前提出了在TMLE中的自适应预设法，以灵活自动地从预先规定的集合中选择在小型试验（N < 40）中最大化经验效率的方法。为了避免在少数随机单位中过度拟合，之前的选择仅限于工作广义线性模型，调整单个协变量。现在，我们将自适应预设法针对具有许多随机单元的试验进行了调整。使用V-fold",
