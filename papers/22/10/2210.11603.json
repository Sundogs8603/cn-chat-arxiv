    "abstract": "Text-to-image AI are capable of generating novel images for inspiration, but their applications for 3D design workflows and how designers can build 3D models using AI-provided inspiration have not yet been explored. To investigate this, we integrated DALL-E, GPT-3, and CLIP within a CAD software in 3DALL-E, a plugin that generates 2D image inspiration for 3D design. 3DALL-E allows users to construct text and image prompts based on what they are modeling. In a study with 13 designers, we found that designers saw great potential in 3DALL-E within their workflows and could use text-to-image AI to produce reference images, prevent design fixation, and inspire design considerations. We elaborate on prompting patterns observed across 3D modeling tasks and provide measures of prompt complexity observed across participants. From our findings, we discuss how 3DALL-E can merge with existing generative design workflows and propose prompt bibliographies as a form of human-AI design history.",

    "translated_abstract": "文本到图像AI能够生成新颖的图像以供灵感，但其在3D设计工作流程中的应用以及设计师如何利用AI提供的灵感构建3D模型尚未被探索。为了研究这个问题，我们将DALL-E、GPT-3和CLIP集成到CAD软件中，创建了3DALL-E插件，用于生成3D设计的2D图像灵感。3DALL-E允许用户基于他们正在建模的内容构建文本和图像提示。在一项涉及13名设计师的研究中，我们发现设计师们认为3DALL-E在他们的工作流程中具有巨大的潜力，可以使用文本到图像AI生成参考图像，防止设计固化，并激发设计的考虑。我们详述了在3D建模任务中观察到的提示模式，并提供了参与者所观察到的提示复杂性的度量。根据我们的研究结果，我们讨论了如何将3DALL-E与现有的生成式设计工作流程相结合，并提出了提示文献目录作为一种人工智能-人类设计历史的形式。",
