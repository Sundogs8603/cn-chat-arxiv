    "translated_abstract": "已经发现，在假设可线性的神经表示中，从中删除可人解释的概念的方法是可行和有用的。然而，这种删除对于基于修改后表示进行训练的下游分类器行为的影响尚未完全理解。在这项工作中，我们正式定义了对数线性保护性的概念，即对手无法直接从表示中预测概念的能力，并研究其影响。我们证明，在二元情况下，在某些假设下，下游对数线性模型无法恢复被删除的概念。然而，我们证明，在某些情况下，可以构建一个多类对数线性模型，间接恢复概念，这指出了对数线性保护性作为下游偏差缓解技术的内在局限性。这些发现揭示了线性删除方法的理论限制，并强调了进一步研究可解释神经表示与分类器之间的联系的需要。",
