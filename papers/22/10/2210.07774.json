    "translated_abstract": "Airbnb是一个双边市场，将出租房源的房东与来自全球的潜在客人联系在一起。将基于神经网络的学习排序技术应用到匹配客人与房东的过程中已经取得了显著的改进。这些排序改进是通过一种核心策略驱动的：按照其预计的预订概率对房源进行排序，然后迭代地改进这些预订概率估计的技术。然而，这一策略暗含的一个假设是，搜索结果中的每个房源的预订概率可以独立确定。本文讨论了这个假设的错误，并提供了一个纠正这个假设的理论基础，以及基于该理论的高效神经网络架构。通过显式考虑房源之间的可能相似性并减小它们的方法，实现了多样化排序。",

By correcting the assumption in traditional ranking frameworks and proposing an efficient neural network architecture-based strategy, it achieves more accurate listing matching and introduces methods to consider listing similarity for diversified ranking."
