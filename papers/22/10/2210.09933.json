    "translated_abstract": "近年来，XAI研究人员正规范化提案和开发新方法来解释黑盒模型，但在社区中对于使用哪种方法来解释这些模型尚无一致意见，而这种选择几乎直接与特定方法的流行度相关。诸如Ciu、Dalex、Eli5、Lofo、Shap和Skater等方法通过特征相关性的全局排名来解释黑盒模型，这些方法基于不同的方法学生成全局解释，说明模型输入如何解释其预测。在这种情况下，使用了41个数据集、4种树集成算法（Light Gradient Boosting、CatBoost、Random Forest和Gradient Boosting）和6种XAI方法来支持推出一种名为eXirt的新的XAI方法，该方法基于项目反应理论（IRT），旨在解释使用关于二分类问题的表格数据的树集成黑盒模型。在第一组分析中，164个全局特征",

    "en_tdlr": "There is no consensus on methods to explain black box models. This paper introduces a new method called eXirt based on Item Response Theory, specifically designed for explaining tree-ensemble models using tabular data. It utilizes global feature rankings to explain the relationship between model inputs and predictions."
