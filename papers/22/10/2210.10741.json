    "abstract": "We propose a goodness-of-fit measure for probability densities modeling observations with varying dimensionality, such as text documents of differing lengths or variable-length sequences. The proposed measure is an instance of the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), which has been used to construct goodness-of-fit tests for unnormalized densities. The KSD is defined by its Stein operator: current operators used in testing apply to fixed-dimensional spaces. As our main contribution, we extend the KSD to the variable-dimension setting by identifying appropriate Stein operators, and propose a novel KSD goodness-of-fit test. As with the previous variants, the proposed KSD does not require the density to be normalized, allowing the evaluation of a large class of models. Our test is shown to perform well in practice on discrete sequential data benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种适用于具有不同维度观测的概率密度模型的适配性度量方法，例如具有不同长度或可变长度序列的文本文档。我们提出的度量方法是核斯坦差异(Kernel Stein Discrepancy, KSD)的一个实例，KSD已被用于构建非标准化密度的适配性检验。KSD通过斯坦算子来定义，目前用于检验的斯坦算子适用于固定维度空间。作为我们的主要贡献，我们通过识别合适的斯坦算子，在可变维度设置下扩展了KSD，并提出了一种新颖的KSD适配性检验方法。与之前的变体一样，我们提出的KSD不要求密度归一化，可以评估大量的模型。我们的测试在离散顺序数据基准上表现良好。",
