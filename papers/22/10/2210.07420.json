    "abstract": "We consider a decluttering problem where multiple rigid convex polygonal objects rest in randomly placed positions and orientations on a planar surface and must be efficiently transported to a packing box using both single and multi-object grasps. Prior work considered frictionless multi-object grasping. In this paper, we introduce friction to increase picks per hour. We train a neural network using real examples to plan robust multi-object grasps. In physical experiments, we find a 13.7% increase in success rate, a 1.6x increase in picks per hour, and a 6.3x decrease in grasp planning time compared to prior work on multi-object grasping. Compared to single object grasping, we find a 3.1x increase in picks per hour.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一个杂乱问题，多个刚性凸多边形物体随机放置在一个平面表面上，必须使用单个和多个物体的抓取方式，将它们有效地运输到装箱中。我们引入摩擦来增加每小时的拾取次数，并使用实例进行神经网络的训练，以计划稳健的多物体抓取。在物理实验中，相比于多物体抓取的先前工作，我们发现成功率增加了13.7％，每小时的拾取次数增加了1.6倍，抓取计划时间减少了6.3倍。与单个物体抓取相比，我们发现每小时的拾取次数增加了3.1倍。",

Compared to prior work, it achieves a 13.7% increase in success rate, a 1.6x increase in picks per hour, and a 6.3x decrease in grasp planning time. The picks per hour also outperform single-object grasping by 3.1x."
