    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个新型的大维近似因子模型，其中加载因子由潜在的一阶马尔可夫过程驱动。通过利用模型的等价线性表示，我们首先通过主成分分析恢复潜在因子。然后我们将模型转化为状态空间形式，并通过基于改进版本的Baum-Lindgren-Hamilton-Kim滤波器和平滑器的EM算法，利用先前估计得到的因子来估计加载因子和转换概率。我们的方法具有吸引力，因为它为所有估计量提供了闭式表达式。更重要的是，它不需要知道真实因子的数量。我们推导了所提估计过程的理论性质，并通过一套全面的蒙特卡洛实验展示了它们的良好有限样本性能。通过对一个大型股票投资组合的应用，我们说明了我们方法的实证效用。",
