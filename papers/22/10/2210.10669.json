    "abstract": "Social media platforms are currently the main channel for political messaging, allowing politicians to target specific demographics and adapt based on their reactions. However, making this communication transparent is challenging, as the messaging is tightly coupled with its intended audience and often echoed by multiple stakeholders interested in advancing specific policies. Our goal in this paper is to take a first step towards understanding these highly decentralized settings. We propose a weakly supervised approach to identify the stance and issue of political ads on Facebook and analyze how political campaigns use some kind of demographic targeting by location, gender, or age. Furthermore, we analyze the temporal dynamics of the political ads on election polls.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体平台目前是政治信息传播的主要渠道，政治家们能够通过这些平台针对特定人群进行宣传，并根据他们的反应进行调整。然而，使这种交流透明化是具有挑战性的，因为信息传播与目标受众紧密相连，并经常被多个利益攸关方共同传播。本文旨在第一步了解这些高度分散的政治活动。我们提出了一种弱监督的方法来识别Facebook上政治广告的立场和议题，并分析政治活动如何使用某种人口统计学定位，如位置、性别或年龄。此外，我们还分析了选举民意调查中政治广告的时间动态。",
