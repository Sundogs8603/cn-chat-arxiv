    "translated_abstract": "在许多领域如医疗保健、天文学和气候科学中，观察到具有缺失值的不规则抽样时间序列数据。这种类型的时间序列的插值对于诸如根本原因分析和医学诊断以及平滑不规则或嘈杂的数据等任务至关重要。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一种名为\"Tripletformer\"的新型编码器-解码器架构，用于处理具有缺失值的不规则抽样时间序列的概率插值。该基于注意力机制的模型操作于观测集合上，其中每个元素由时间、通道和值组成。Tripletformer的编码器和解码器采用了注意力层和全连接层的设计，使得模型能够有效处理所提供的集合元素。我们在多个真实和合成数据集上将Tripletformer与一系列基准模型进行了评估，并表明它能够产生更准确和确定的插值结果。结果显示了一种改进的插值性能。",
