    "abstract": "In this work, we tackle the problem of open-ended learning by introducing a method that simultaneously evolves agents and increasingly challenging environments. Unlike previous open-ended approaches that optimize agents using a fixed neural network topology, we hypothesize that generalization can be improved by allowing agents' controllers to become more complex as they encounter more difficult environments. Our method, Augmentative Topology EPOET (ATEP), extends the Enhanced Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (EPOET) algorithm by allowing agents to evolve their own neural network structures over time, adding complexity and capacity as necessary. Empirical results demonstrate that ATEP results in general agents capable of solving more environments than a fixed-topology baseline. We also investigate mechanisms for transferring agents between environments and find that a species-based approach further improves the performance and generalization of agents.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们通过引入一种同时演化智能体和日益具有挑战性的环境的方法来解决开放式学习的问题。与之前优化智能体使用固定神经网络拓扑的开放式方法不同，我们假设通过允许智能体的控制器在遇到更困难的环境时变得更加复杂，可以改善泛化能力。我们的方法，增强拓扑EPOET（ATEP），通过允许智能体随着时间的推移演化出自己的神经网络结构，根据需要增加复杂性和容量。实证结果表明，ATEP可以产生能够解决更多环境的通用智能体，而固定拓扑基线则无法做到这一点。我们还研究了智能体在环境之间的转移机制，发现基于物种的方法进一步改善了智能体的性能和泛化能力。",
