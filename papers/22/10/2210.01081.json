    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习文献中，数据集转换问题一直是一个众所周知的问题，与机器学习标准假设不同的是，训练集和测试集中的数据可能遵循不同的概率分布，导致机器学习系统的泛化性能不佳。这个问题在脑机接口领域尤为突出，因为生物信号如脑电图信号通常被用于数据处理。然而，脑电信号在时间和不同受试者之间都非常不稳定。为了解决这个问题，许多提出的解决方法都基于最近的转移学习方法，如领域适应。然而，在许多情况下，改进的实际原因仍然模糊。本文着重研究数据标准化或标准化策略在领域适应方法中的影响。具体而言，本文使用SEED、DEAP和BCI竞赛IV 2a EEG数据集，对数据标准化策略应用于领域适应方法中的影响进行了实验评估。",
