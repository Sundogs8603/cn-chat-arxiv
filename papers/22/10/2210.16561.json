    "abstract": "Small targets are often submerged in cluttered backgrounds of infrared images. Conventional detectors tend to generate false alarms, while CNN-based detectors lose small targets in deep layers. To this end, we propose iSmallNet, a multi-stream densely nested network with label decoupling for infrared small object detection. On the one hand, to fully exploit the shape information of small targets, we decouple the original labeled ground-truth (GT) map into an interior map and a boundary one. The GT map, in collaboration with the two additional maps, tackles the unbalanced distribution of small object boundaries. On the other hand, two key modules are delicately designed and incorporated into the proposed network to boost the overall performance. First, to maintain small targets in deep layers, we develop a multi-scale nested interaction module to explore a wide range of context information. Second, we develop an interior-boundary fusion module to integrate multi-granularity information.",

    "translated_abstract": "红外图像中的小目标常常被杂乱的背景所掩盖。传统的检测器往往会产生误报，而基于CNN的检测器则会在深层中丢失小目标。为此，我们提出了一种名为iSmallNet的多流密集嵌套网络，采用标签解耦来用于红外小目标检测。一方面，为了充分利用小目标的形状信息，我们将原始的标记地面真值(GT)图解耦为内部图和边界图。GT图与另外两张图协同工作，以解决小目标边界的不均衡分布问题。另一方面，我们精心设计并融入了两个关键模块到提议的网络中，以提高整体性能。首先，为了在深层中保留小目标，我们开发了一个多尺度嵌套交互模块来探索广泛的上下文信息。其次，我们开发了一个内部边界融合模块来集成多粒度信息。",
