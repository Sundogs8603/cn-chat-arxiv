    "abstract": "arXiv:2210.15658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: High cost and lack of reliability has precluded the widespread adoption of dexterous hands in robotics. Furthermore, the lack of a viable tactile sensor capable of sensing over the entire area of the hand impedes the rich, low-level feedback that would improve learning of dexterous manipulation skills. This paper introduces an inexpensive, modular, robust, and scalable platform -- the DManus -- aimed at resolving these challenges while satisfying the large-scale data collection capabilities demanded by deep robot learning paradigms. Studies on human manipulation point to the criticality of low-level tactile feedback in performing everyday dexterous tasks. The DManus comes with ReSkin sensing on the entire surface of the palm as well as the fingertips. We demonstrate effectiveness of the fully integrated system in a tactile aware task -- bin picking and sorting. Code, documentation, design files, detailed assembly instructions, ",
