QUD views each sentence as an answer to a question triggered in prior context; thus, we characterize relationships between sentences as free-form questions, in contrast to exhaustive fine-grained taxonomies. We develop the first-of-its-kind QUD parser that derives a dependency structure of questions over full documents, trained using a large, crowdsourced question-answering dataset DCQA (Ko et al., 2022). Human evaluation results show that QUD dependency parsing is possible for language models trained with this crowdsourced, generalizable annotation scheme. We illustrate how our QUD structure is distinct from RST t",

    "translated_abstract": "自动话语处理对数据存在瓶颈问题：当前话语形式主要是需要大规模的、高度苛刻的标注任务，牵涉到大量的话语关系分类，这使得普通标注者很难进行标注。相反，本文采用了问题下讨论（QUD）的语言框架进行话语分析，并试图自动推导出QUD结构。QUD视每个句子为先前环境中引发的问题的答案；因此，我们将句子之间的关系视为自由形式的问题，与详尽的精细分类不同。我们开发了首个QUD解析器，可以针对完整文档推导出问题的依赖结构，并使用一个大型的、众包问答数据集DCQA（Ko等人，2022）进行训练。人类评估结果表明，使用这种众包数据的通用标注方案，可以对语言模型进行QUD依赖解析。我们还说明了我们的QUD结构与RST t的不同之处。",
