    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning (ML) paradigm that enables heterogeneous edge devices to collaboratively train ML models without revealing their raw data to a logically centralized server. However, beyond the heterogeneous device capacity, FL participants often exhibit differences in their data distributions, which are not independent and identically distributed (Non-IID). Many existing works present point solutions to address issues like slow convergence, low final accuracy, and bias in FL, all stemming from client heterogeneity. In this paper, we explore an additional layer of complexity to mitigate such heterogeneity by grouping clients with statistically similar data distributions (cohorts). We propose Auxo to gradually identify such cohorts in large-scale, low-availability, and resource-constrained FL populations. Auxo then adaptively determines how to train cohort-specific models in order to achieve better model performance and ensure resource efficiency. ",

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习(FL)是一种新兴的机器学习(ML)范式，它使得异构边缘设备能够在不向一个逻辑上集中的服务器透露原始数据的情况下共同训练ML模型。然而，除了异构设备容量外，FL参与者往往在其数据分布方面存在差异，这些差异不是独立同分布的(Non-IID)。许多现有的工作针对由于客户端异质性引起的收敛速度慢、最终准确度低和偏差等问题提出了一些点解决方案。在本文中，我们通过将有统计相似数据分布的客户端进行分组来解决这种异质性问题。我们提出了Auxo来逐步识别大规模、低可用性和资源受限的FL人群中的这些分组。然后，Auxo自适应地确定如何训练特定分组的模型，以实现更好的模型性能并确保资源的有效利用。",
