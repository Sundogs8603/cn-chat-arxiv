    "translated_abstract": "近年来，数据驱动方法在磁共振成像(MRI)重建方面取得了显著的成功，但由于缺乏普适性和可解释性，其集成到临床常规中仍然存在挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于生成图像先验的统一框架，以解决这些挑战。我们提出了一种新颖的深度神经网络正则化器，它在仅有参考幅值图像的生成环境下进行训练。训练后，正则化器编码了高层次的域统计信息，我们通过合成无数据图像来证明这一点。将训练好的模型嵌入到经典的变分方法中，可以得到高质量的重建结果，不受子采样方式的影响。此外，当面临对比度变化的分布外数据时，该模型呈现出稳定的行为。此外，概率解释提供了重建结果的分布，从而允许不确定性量化。",
