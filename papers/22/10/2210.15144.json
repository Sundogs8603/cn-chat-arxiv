We find that masked language models capture societal stigma about gender in mental health: models are consistently more likely to predict female subjects than male in sentences about having a mental health condition (32% vs. 19%), and this disparity is exacerbated for sentences that indicate treatment-seeking behavior.

    "translated_abstract": "心理健康歧视阻碍了许多人获得适当的治疗，社会心理学研究表明，心理健康倾向于被男性忽视。本研究探讨了面具语言模型中的性别化心理健康歧视。我们运用临床心理学文献来建立框架来实现心理健康歧视的操作性，使用心理学研究中的提示来评估模型生成性别化词汇的倾向性。我们发现面具语言模型捕捉到了关于性别在心理健康方面的社会歧视：在有心理健康问题的句子中，模型更有可能预测女性主语而非男性（32％比19％），这种差异在表明寻求治疗行为的句子中更为明显。此外，我们发现不同的模型在男女的歧视维度上表现不同，将如愤怒、责怪和怜悯等刻板印象与心理健康问题的女性联系得更紧密。我们的发现强调了需要考虑自然语言处理中的性别化心理健康歧视，并敦促研究人员和实践者注意他们的模型可能对维持有害刻板印象的影响。",
