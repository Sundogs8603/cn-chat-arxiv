    "abstract": "We extend the use of Classification Without Labels for anomaly detection with a hypothesis test designed to exclude the background-only hypothesis. By testing for statistical independence of the two discriminating dataset regions, we are able to exclude the background-only hypothesis without relying on fixed anomaly score cuts or extrapolations of background estimates between regions. The method relies on the assumption of conditional independence of anomaly score features and dataset regions, which can be ensured using existing decorrelation techniques. As a benchmark example, we consider the LHC Olympics dataset where we show that mutual information represents a suitable test for statistical independence and our method exhibits excellent and robust performance at different signal fractions even in presence of realistic feature correlations.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们扩展了使用无标签分类进行异常检测，并设计了一种排除仅背景假设的假设检验。通过测试两个区域的差异数据的统计独立性，我们能够在不依赖固定异常得分阈值或在区域之间外推背景估计的情况下，排除仅背景假设。该方法依赖于异常得分特征和数据集区域的条件独立性假设，这可以通过现有的去相关技术来保证。作为基准例子，我们考虑了LHC奥林匹克数据集，并展示了互信息表示了一种适用于统计独立性检验的方法，我们的方法在不同信号分数下展现了出色且稳健的性能，即使在存在实际特征相关性的情况下。",
