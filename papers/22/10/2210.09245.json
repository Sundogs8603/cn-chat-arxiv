    "translated_abstract": "三维抓取合成是给定一个物体，生成抓取姿态的过程。现有方法通过学习从物体到抓取姿态分布的直接映射来解决这个问题。然而，由于物理接触对姿态微小变化非常敏感，三维物体表示到有效姿态的高度非线性映射相当不平滑，导致生成效率低且通用性受限。为了解决这个挑战，我们引入了接触区域中间变量来约束抓取姿势的生成；换句话说，我们将映射分解为两个顺序阶段，假设接触地图给定的情况下姿势完全受限：1）我们首先学习接触地图分布，以生成用于抓取的潜在接触地图；2）然后学习从接触地图到抓取姿势的映射。进一步地，我们提出了一种考虑到穿透的优化方法，将生成的接触作为一致性约束进行抓取细化。通过大量实验验证了方法的有效性。",
