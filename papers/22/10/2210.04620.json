    "translated_abstract": "联合学习（FL）是一种新颖的方法，使持有敏感数据的多个客户端能够协作地训练机器学习模型，而不需要集中数据。跨设备联合学习是指少量（2-50）可靠客户端的情况，每个客户端持有中到大型的数据集，并且通常出现在医疗、金融或工业等应用中。虽然之前的工作已经为跨设备FL提出了代表性数据集，但很少有逼真的健康医疗跨设备FL数据集存在，从而减缓了这一关键应用的算法研究。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新颖的跨设备数据集套件，FLamby（您的跨设备联合学习充足基准），专注于医疗保健，以弥合跨设备FL理论和实践之间的差距。FLamby包括7个医疗保健数据集，具有自然拆分，涵盖多个任务、模态和数据量，每个数据集都配有基线训练代码。作为示例，我们还对FLamby进行了详细的性能评估。",
