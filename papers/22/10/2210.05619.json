Here we show another problem with multilingual models: grammatical structures in higher-resource languages bleed into lower-resource languages, a phenomenon we call grammatical structure bias. We show this bias via a novel method for comparing the fluency of multilingual models to the fluency of monolingual Spanish and Greek models: testing their preference for two carefully-chosen variable grammatical structures (optional pronoun-drop in Spanish and optional Subject-Verb ordering in Greek). We find that multilingual BERT is biased toward the English-like setting (explicit pronouns and Subject-Verb-Object ordering) as compared to our monolingual control language model. With our case studies, we hope to bring to light the fine-grained ways in which multilingual models can ",

    "translated_abstract": "多语言语言模型可以通过利用高资源语言来提高低资源语言的自然语言处理性能，但它们也会降低所有语言的平均性能（“多语言诅咒”）。本文显示多语言模型的另一个问题：高资源语言的语法结构会渗入低资源语言，这种现象被称为语法结构偏差。我们通过一种新方法比较多语言模型的流畅性与单语西班牙语和希腊语模型的流畅性，展示了这种模型的偏差：测试它们对两种精心选择的可变语法结构的偏好（西班牙语中的可选省略代词和希腊语中的可选主语-谓语调序）。我们发现，与我们的单语控制语言模型相比，多语言BERT偏向于类似英语的设置（显式代词和主-谓-宾语调序）。通过我们的案例研究，我们希望揭示多语言模型能够以精细的方式影响自然语言处理流畅性的细节。",
