    "translated_abstract": "跨度识别的目标是从文本输入中识别出特定的文本跨度，并将其分类到预定义的类别中。本文首次探索了同类跨度的对等关系，即Peer (PR)关系，这种关系表明两个跨度是同一类别的实例并且具有相似的特征。提出了一种新颖的基于对等关系数据增强方法，称为PeerDA，使用带有PR关系的跨度对作为训练的增强数据。PeerDA有两个独特的优点：（1）有大量的PR跨度对可以用来增强训练数据；（2）增强的数据可以防止模型过拟合表面上的跨度-类别映射，并推动模型利用跨度语义。在七个领域的四种不同任务的十个数据集上的实验结果表明了PeerDA的有效性。尤其值得注意的是，PeerDA在数据增强方面表现出色，显著优于现有的最先进数据增强方法。",
