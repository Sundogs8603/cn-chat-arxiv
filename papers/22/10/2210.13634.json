    "translated_abstract": "当今的建筑工程和施工(AEC)软件需要学习曲线以生成三维建筑表示。这限制了通过单个草图快速验证初步设计想法的体积含义的能力。允许设计师将单个草图转换为三维建筑将使业主能够立即可视化3D项目信息，无需进行认知负荷。如果以前的最先进的数据驱动单视图重建(SVR)方法在单个图像或草图的重建过程中展现出了出色的结果，那么它们在AEC中缺乏具体应用、分析和实验。因此，本研究弥补了这一空白，介绍了第一种专注于建筑物的深度学习方法：Vitruvio，旨在将单个草图转换为三维建筑网格。Vitruvio在特定建筑数据集(曼哈顿1K)上调整使用占位网络进行SVR任务。这种适应性带来了与SOTA方法相比在3D建筑重建质量方面的显著改进。",
