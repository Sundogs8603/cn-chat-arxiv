    "translated_abstract": "深度学习的进展彰显了利用多样的机器人数据集实现有效泛化的巨大潜力，这让我们有动力考虑利用广泛的数据集实现机器人学习的鲁棒泛化。但是，在实践中，我们经常希望在新的环境中学习新的技能，这可能不包含在先前的数据中。因此，我们想知道：如何将现有的多样离线数据集与少量任务特定数据结合起来，解决新任务，同时仍然享受大量数据训练的泛化优势？在本文中，我们展示了端到端离线RL可以是一种有效的方法来实现这一点，而不需要任何表示学习或基于视觉的预训练。我们提出了预训练机器人（PTR），这是一个基于离线RL的框架，试图通过将现有机器人数据集上的预训练与快速精细调整的过程相结合来有效地学习新任务。",
