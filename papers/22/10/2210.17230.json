These generative algorithms are particle-based and are constructed as gradient flows of Lipschitz-regularized Kullback-Leibler or other $f$-divergences, where data from a source distribution can be stably transported as particles, towards the vicinity of the target distribution. As a highlighted result in data integration, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithms correctly transport gene expression data points with dimension exceeding 54K, while the sample size is typically only in the hundreds.",
