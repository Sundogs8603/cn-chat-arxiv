    "abstract": "Neurons in the brain are often finely tuned for specific task variables. Moreover, such disentangled representations are highly sought after in machine learning. Here we mathematically prove that simple biological constraints on neurons, namely nonnegativity and energy efficiency in both activity and weights, promote such sought after disentangled representations by enforcing neurons to become selective for single factors of task variation. We demonstrate these constraints lead to disentanglement in a variety of tasks and architectures, including variational autoencoders. We also use this theory to explain why the brain partitions its cells into distinct cell types such as grid and object-vector cells, and also explain when the brain instead entangles representations in response to entangled task factors. Overall, this work provides a mathematical understanding of why single neurons in the brain often represent single human-interpretable factors, and steps towards an understanding task",

    "translated_abstract": "大脑中的神经元经常对特定任务变量进行微调。此外，这种解缠的表示在机器学习中备受追捧。在这里，我们数学证明了对神经元的简单生物学约束（即在活动和权重方面的非负性和能量效率）通过强制神经元对任务变化的单个因素具有选择性，从而促进了这种被追求的解缠表示。我们展示了这些约束可导致各种任务和架构下的解缠，包括变分自编码器。我们还使用这个理论解释了为什么大脑将其细胞分成不同的细胞类型（例如网格和对象向量细胞），以及解释了大脑何时对纠缠的任务因素进行纠缠的表示。总体而言，这项工作提供了对为什么大脑中的单个神经元经常表示单个可解释因素的数学理解，并迈向了解决任务表示的目标。",
