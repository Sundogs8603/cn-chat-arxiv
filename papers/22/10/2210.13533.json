    "translated_abstract": "机器学习算法在各种应用中展现出了卓越的性能。然而，在训练集和测试集的分布不同的情况下，保证性能仍然具有挑战性。为了改善分布转移情况下的性能，已经提出了一些方法，通过学习跨组或领域的不变特征来提高性能。然而，我们观察到之前的工作只部分地学习了不变特征。虽然先前的工作侧重于有限的不变特征，但我们首次提出了充分不变特征的重要性。由于只有训练集是经验性的，从训练集中学习得到的部分不变特征可能不存在于分布转移时的测试集中。因此，分布转移情况下的性能提高可能受到限制。本文认为从训练集中学习充分的不变特征对于分布转移情况至关重要。",

The authors observe that previous works only learn partial invariant features and argue that these partial features might not be applicable to test sets during distribution shifts, limiting performance improvement."
