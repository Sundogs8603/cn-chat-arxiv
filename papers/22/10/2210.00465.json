    "abstract": "In recent years, hate speech has gained great relevance in social networks and other virtual media because of its intensity and its relationship with violent acts against members of protected groups. Due to the great amount of content generated by users, great effort has been made in the research and development of automatic tools to aid the analysis and moderation of this speech, at least in its most threatening forms. One of the limitations of current approaches to automatic hate speech detection is the lack of context. Most studies and resources are performed on data without context; that is, isolated messages without any type of conversational context or the topic being discussed. This restricts the available information to define if a post on a social network is hateful or not. In this work, we provide a novel corpus for contextualized hate speech detection based on user responses to news posts from media outlets on Twitter. This corpus was collected in the Rioplatense dialectal v",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，由于其强度和与受保护群体成员的暴力行为的关系，仇恨言论在社交网络和其他虚拟媒体中获得了极大的关注。由于用户生成的内容数量巨大，因此在研究和开发自动工具以帮助分析和管理这种言论方面已经做出了巨大的努力，至少在其最具威胁性的形式中。当前自动检测仇恨言论方法的一个限制是缺乏上下文。大多数研究和资源是在没有上下文的数据上进行的；也就是说，孤立的消息没有任何类型的对话上下文或正在讨论的主题。这限制了可用信息来定义社交网络上的帖子是否具有仇恨性。在这项工作中，我们提供了一个基于Twitter上媒体机构新闻帖子的用户响应的上下文化仇恨言论检测新语料库。",
