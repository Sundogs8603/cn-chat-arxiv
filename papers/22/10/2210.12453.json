    "translated_abstract": "具有特殊约束条件的生成树问题在现实场景中往往难以解决，通常需要复杂的算法设计和指数级的时间。最近，对于解决路由问题的端到端深度神经网络越来越受到关注。然而，这种方法通常会产生顶点序列，这使得难以将其应用于解决由边构成解集的一般组合优化问题，例如各种生成树问题。本文提出了一种名为NeuroPrim的新框架，通过为图上的一般组合优化问题定义马尔科夫决策过程（MDP）来解决各种生成树问题。我们的方法利用Prim算法减少了动作和状态空间，并使用REINFORCE训练了结果模型。我们将我们的框架应用于欧几里得空间中的三个困难问题：度约束最小生成树（DCMST）问题，最小路由成本生成树（MRCT）问题和最小实际距离生成树的问题（MST）。",
