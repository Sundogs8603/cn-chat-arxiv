    "abstract": "We consider estimation and inference for a regression coefficient in panels with interactive fixed effects (i.e., with a factor structure). We show that previously developed estimators and confidence intervals (CIs) might be heavily biased and size-distorted when some of the factors are weak. We propose estimators with improved rates of convergence and bias-aware CIs that are uniformly valid regardless of whether the factors are strong or not. Our approach applies the theory of minimax linear estimation to form a debiased estimate using a nuclear norm bound on the error of an initial estimate of the interactive fixed effects. We use the obtained estimate to construct a bias-aware CI taking into account the remaining bias due to weak factors. In Monte Carlo experiments, we find a substantial improvement over conventional approaches when factors are weak, with little cost to estimation error when factors are strong.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑具有交互固定效应（即具有因子结构）的面板数据中回归系数的估计和推断问题。我们发现之前开发的估计器和置信区间可能在一些因素较弱的情况下存在严重的偏倚和大小失真。我们提出了具有改进收敛速度和偏倚感知置信区间的估计器，无论因素是否强壮都能保持统一有效。我们的方法采用最小化线性估计理论，在初始交互固定效应的误差上使用核范数约束来形成一个无偏估计。我们利用所得估计构建一个考虑到因素弱引起的剩余偏差的偏倚感知置信区间。在蒙特卡洛实验中，我们发现在因素较弱的情况下相较于传统方法有显著改进，并且在因素较强的情况下几乎没有估计误差的损失。",
