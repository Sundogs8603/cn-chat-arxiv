    "abstract": "Existing benchmark datasets for recommender systems (RS) either are created at a small scale or involve very limited forms of user feedback. RS models evaluated on such datasets often lack practical values for large-scale real-world applications. In this paper, we describe Tenrec, a novel and publicly available data collection for RS that records various user feedback from four different recommendation scenarios. To be specific, Tenrec has the following five characteristics: (1) it is large-scale, containing around 5 million users and 140 million interactions; (2) it has not only positive user feedback, but also true negative feedback (vs. one-class recommendation); (3) it contains overlapped users and items across four different scenarios; (4) it contains various types of user positive feedback, in forms of clicks, likes, shares, and follows, etc; (5) it contains additional features beyond the user IDs and item IDs. We verify Tenrec on ten diverse recommendation tasks by running sever",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的推荐系统基准数据集要么规模较小，要么只涉及非常有限形式的用户反馈。在这篇论文中，我们介绍了一个全新的、公开可用的推荐系统数据集“Tenrec”，记录了来自四种不同推荐场景的各种用户反馈。具体而言，Tenrec 具有以下五个特点：(1)它是大规模的，包含约 500 万用户和 1.4 亿次交互;(2)它不仅具有积极的用户反馈，还有真正的负反馈;(3)它包含了四个不同场景中的重叠用户和项目;(4)它包含了各种类型的用户积极反馈，以点击、喜欢、分享和关注等形式展现;(5)它还包含了用户 ID 和项目 ID 以外的其他特征。我们运行了多种最先进的推荐系统模型来验证 Tenrec，结果展示了 Tenrec 对推荐系统模型的挑战，以及其实际潜力。Tenrec 可以作为一个综合性的基准数据集，评估推荐系统模型的各个方面，如推荐质量、反馈预测、数据稀疏性、迁移学习和多样性促进等。",
