    "translated_abstract": "公用事业公司面临的首要挑战之一是在确保高效供应的同时尽量减少温室气体排放。智能电表和智能电网的出现为通过主动技术（如负荷预测）实现热能的优化供应提供了前所未有的优势。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于神经网络的热需求预测框架，其中时间序列被编码为具有嵌入外生变量（如天气和假期/非假期）能力的scalogram。随后，使用CNN来预测未来多步骤的热负荷。最后，将所提出的框架与其他最先进的方法（如SARIMAX和LSTM）进行了比较。来自丹麦的实际数据的回顾性实验证明，所提出的框架在定量结果上持续优于最先进的基准方法。MAPE的最小均误差为7.54％，RMSE为417kW。",
