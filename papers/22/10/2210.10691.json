    "translated_abstract": "虽然强化学习在许多应用中产生了非常有前途的结果，但其主要缺点是缺乏安全保障，这阻止了其在安全关键系统中的使用。本文针对非线性连续系统提出了一个用于解决到达-避免任务的安全屏障，并通过将提出的动作投影到最接近的安全动作来防止强化学习代理应用可能不安全的动作。这种方法称为行动投影，是通过混合整数优化实现的。行动投影的安全约束是通过应用参数化可达性分析使用多项式Zonotopes得到的，这使得能够准确捕捉动作对系统的非线性影响。与其他最先进的行动投影方法相比，我们的安全屏障可以有效地处理输入限制和动态障碍物，使得机器人空间维度的整合更加容易。",
