    "abstract": "The manifold hypothesis, which assumes that data lies on or close to an unknown manifold of low intrinsic dimension, is a staple of modern machine learning research. However, recent work has shown that real-world data exhibits distinct non-manifold structures, i.e. singularities, that can lead to erroneous findings. Detecting such singularities is therefore crucial as a precursor to interpolation and inference tasks. We address this issue by developing a topological framework that (i) quantifies the local intrinsic dimension, and (ii) yields a Euclidicity score for assessing the 'manifoldness' of a point along multiple scales. Our approach identifies singularities of complex spaces, while also capturing singular structures and local geometric complexity in image data.",

    "translated_abstract": "流形假设是现代机器学习研究的一个基本假设，它假定数据位于或接近于低固有维度的未知流形上。然而，最近的研究表明，现实世界的数据表现出明显的非流形结构，即奇异性，这可能导致错误的发现。因此，检测这种奇异性在插值和推断任务之前是至关重要的。我们通过开发一个拓扑框架来解决这个问题，该框架能够（i）量化局部固有维度，以及（ii）在多个尺度上产生“欧几里得性”评分，用以评估点的“流形度”。我们的方法可以在图像数据中捕获复杂空间的奇异性，同时捕捉奇异结构和局部几何复杂性。",
