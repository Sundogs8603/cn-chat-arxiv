    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了两个交易者之间的随机博弈，其中一个是缓慢的机构投资者，另一个是高频交易者，他们在交易风险资产时的聚合订单流将影响资产价格。我们通过两个耦合的随机控制问题来建模这个系统，其中高频交易者更频繁地利用价格预测信号的可用信息，但也受到周期性的“收盘前”清仓限制。我们首先在任何可接受的机构投资者策略下推导出高频交易者的最优策略。然后，我们通过Fredholm积分方程的解来解决机构投资者的问题，给出了高频交易者的最优信号自适应策略，从而建立了博弈的唯一多期Stackelberg均衡。我们的结果提供了一个显式解，显示高频交易者可以在每个期间采取掠夺或合作策略。",
