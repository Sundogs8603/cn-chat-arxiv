    "translated_abstract": "倒排文件结构是一种常用的加速稠密检索的技术。它根据嵌入将文档聚类；在搜索过程中，根据输入查询探测附近的聚类，并且仅对其中的文档进行后续的解码，从而避免了穷举遍历的昂贵代价。然而，聚类过程总是有损的，这导致探测到的聚类中缺失了相关的文档，从而降低了检索质量。相反，词汇匹配，如显著词汇的重叠，更容易识别相关文档。在这项工作中，我们提出了混合倒排索引 (HI$^2$)，其中嵌入聚类和显著词汇共同加速稠密检索。为了兼顾效果和效率，我们设计了一个聚类选择器和一个词汇选择器，用于构建紧凑的倒排列表并快速搜索它们。此外，我们利用简单的无监督算法和端到端学习来提高索引质量.",
