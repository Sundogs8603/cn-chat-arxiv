    "translated_abstract": "尽管联邦学习（FL）承诺保护隐私，但最近在图像和文本领域的研究显示，训练更新会泄露私人客户数据。然而，在高风险的FL应用（例如医疗和金融）中使用的大多数表格数据中，数据泄露的风险尚未被探索。成功的表格数据攻击必须解决两个领域独特的关键挑战：（i）解决高方差混合离散连续优化问题的方法，以及（ii）使人类能够评估重构，因为与图像和文本数据不同，无法直接人工检查。在这项工作中，我们解决了这些挑战，并提出了TabLeak，第一个针对表格数据的全面重构攻击。TabLeak基于两个关键贡献：(i)一种利用softmax放松和池化集成解决优化问题的方法， (ii)一种基于熵的不确定性量化方案，以实现人类评估。",
