    "translated_abstract": "具有强大表示能力的图神经网络（GNN）已经被广泛应用于生物基因预测、社交推荐等领域。最近的研究表明，GNN容易受到后门攻击的影响，即使用恶意样本训练的模型很容易被修补后的样本欺骗。大多数的后门攻击研究使用的触发器要么是随机生成的子图（例如 erd\\H{o}s-r\\'enyi 后门），以减轻计算负担，要么是基于梯度的生成子图（例如图Trojan攻击），以使攻击更加有效。然而，如何理解触发器结构与后门攻击效果之间的关系却在当前文献中被忽略了。在图中，重复性和具有统计显著性的子图（motif）包含了丰富的结构信息。因此，本文从motif的角度重新思考触发器的设计，并提出一种基于motif的GNN后门攻击方法。我们设计了一种基于motif的触发器生成器，利用motif信息提高了后门攻击的隐蔽性和效果。在各种基准数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明我们的方法在攻击成功率和隐蔽性方面均优于现有的后门攻击方法。",
