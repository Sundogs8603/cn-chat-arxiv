We conduct experiments to illustrate that existing defenses provide little protection and the corresponding adversarial traffic can even evade the SOTA NIDS Kitsune.

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习（DL）方法已被广泛应用于基于异常的网络入侵检测系统（NIDS）以检测恶意流量。为了扩大基于DL的方法的使用场景，联邦学习（FL）允许多个用户在尊重个体数据隐私的基础上训练一个全局模型。然而，尚未对现有防御措施下FL-based NIDSs对现有隐私攻击的鲁棒性进行系统评估。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了两种针对FL-based NIDSs设计的隐私评估指标，包括（1）隐私评分，用于评估使用重构攻击恢复的流量特征与原始特征之间的相似性，以及（2）对抗攻击下使用恢复的流量对抗NIDSs的逃避率。我们进行实验来说明现有的防御措施提供了很少的保护，相应的对抗流量甚至可以规避SOTA NIDS Kitsune。为了防御此类攻击并构建更加鲁棒的FL系统。",
