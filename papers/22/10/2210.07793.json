    "translated_abstract": "分散式加密货币是依赖于用户和矿工间奖励协调以保证其正确运作并向用户提供高质量服务的支付体系。最近的文献研究交易费机制（TFM）拍卖的机制设计问题。我们提出了一个通用框架，涵盖了贪婪和非贪婪两种情况，以及用户可能的不同战略模型。在这个通用框架中，当限制为贪婪情况时，我们证明了费率由用户自主决定，基于收费情况贪婪选择可用交易的机制对用户而言并不是占优策略激励兼容的。然而，它有一个贝叶斯-纳什均衡，使得对报价进行略微弱化。通过放松这种激励兼容性要求，既能绕过先前工作证明的不可能性结果，又能实现近似收益和福利最优的贪婪矿工博弈兼容（MMIC）。",
