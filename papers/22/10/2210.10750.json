    "abstract": "As industrial applications are increasingly automated by machine learning models, enforcing personal data ownership and intellectual property rights requires tracing training data back to their rightful owners. Membership inference algorithms approach this problem by using statistical techniques to discern whether a target sample was included in a model's training set. However, existing methods only utilize the unaltered target sample or simple augmentations of the target to compute statistics. Such a sparse sampling of the model's behavior carries little information, leading to poor inference capabilities. In this work, we use adversarial tools to directly optimize for queries that are discriminative and diverse. Our improvements achieve significantly more accurate membership inference than existing methods, especially in offline scenarios and in the low false-positive regime which is critical in legal settings.

    "translated_abstract": "随着机器学习模型的日益自动化，保护个人数据所有权和知识产权需要追溯训练数据的原始所有者。成员推断算法通过使用统计技术来确定目标样本是否包含在模型的训练集中来解决这个问题。然而，现有方法只利用原始目标样本或目标样本的简单扩展来计算统计量。这种对模型行为的稀疏采样带来了很少的信息，导致成员推断的能力较差。在本文中，我们使用对抗工具直接优化具有鉴别性和多样性的查询。与现有方法相比，我们的改进在离线场景和低误报重要的情况下实现了更准确的成员推断。代码可在 https://github.com/YuxinWenRick/canary-in-a-coalmine 中获取。",
