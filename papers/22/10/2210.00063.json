    "translated_abstract": "知识库问答旨在使用知识库中的实体和关系等事实信息回答自然语言问题。先前的方法要么生成可在知识库上执行以获取最终答案的逻辑形式，要么直接预测答案。实验证据表明，前者通常能产生更准确的答案，但由于生成的逻辑形式可能存在语法和语义错误的潜在问题，因此存在无法执行的问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的框架 DecAF，它联合生成逻辑形式和直接答案，然后将它们的优点结合起来得到最终答案。此外，与大多数先前的方法不同，DecAF 基于简单的自由文本检索，而不依赖任何实体链接工具--这种简化使其适应不同的数据集更加容易。DecAF 在 WebQSP、FreebaseQA 和 GrailQA 基准测试中取得了新的最高准确性，同时在 CommonsenseQA 基准测试上取得了具有竞争力的结果。",
