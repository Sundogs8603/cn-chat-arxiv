A general finding is that cooperation and coordination between nations on solar geoengineering is very much incentivized. Furthermore, the stability of solar geoengineering agreements between nations crucially depends on the perceived riskiness of solar geoengineering. If solar geoengineering is perceived as riskier, the stability of the most stable solar geoengineering agreements is reduced.

    "translated_abstract": "本文引入了一个简单的模型，研究了国家间合作太阳辐射管理的行为。通过数值方法探索了该模型的结果。总体发现是，太阳辐射管理上的国家合作和协调受到激励。此外，太阳辐射管理协议的稳定性关键取决于太阳辐射管理的风险程度。如果太阳辐射管理被认为更为有风险，最稳定的太阳辐射管理协议的稳定性将会降低。然而，协议的稳定性与国家偏好完全无关。",
