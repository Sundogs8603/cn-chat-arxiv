    "abstract": "Panoptic segmentation assigns semantic and instance ID labels to every pixel of an image. As permutations of instance IDs are also valid solutions, the task requires learning of high-dimensional one-to-many mapping. As a result, state-of-the-art approaches use customized architectures and task-specific loss functions. We formulate panoptic segmentation as a discrete data generation problem, without relying on inductive bias of the task. A diffusion model is proposed to model panoptic masks, with a simple architecture and generic loss function. By simply adding past predictions as a conditioning signal, our method is capable of modeling video (in a streaming setting) and thereby learns to track object instances automatically. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our simple approach can perform competitively to state-of-the-art specialist methods in similar settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "全景分割为图像的每个像素分配语义和实例ID标签。由于实例ID的排列也是有效的解决方案，该任务需要学习高维度的一对多映射。因此，最先进的方法使用定制的架构和任务特定的损失函数。我们将全景分割问题定义为离散数据生成问题，不依赖任务的归纳偏差。我们提出了一个扩散模型来建模全景掩码，具有简单的架构和通用的损失函数。通过将过去的预测作为条件信号添加，我们的方法能够在流式设置中建模视频，并自动学习跟踪对象实例。通过大量实验证明，我们的简单方法在类似的设置下能够与最先进的专家方法竞争。",
