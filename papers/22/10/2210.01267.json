    "abstract": "We study learning on social media with an equilibrium model of users interacting with shared news stories. Rational users arrive sequentially, observe an original story (i.e., a private signal) and a sample of predecessors' stories in a news feed, and then decide which stories to share. The observed sample of stories depends on what predecessors share as well as the sampling algorithm generating news feeds. We focus on how often this algorithm selects more viral (i.e., widely shared) stories. Showing users viral stories can increase information aggregation, but it can also generate steady states where most shared stories are wrong. These misleading steady states self-perpetuate, as users who observe wrong stories develop wrong beliefs, and thus rationally continue to share them. Finally, we describe several consequences for platform design and robustness.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了社交媒体上的学习，采用了一个均衡模型来描述用户与共享新闻故事进行交互。理性用户按顺序到达，观察到原始故事（即私有信号）和新闻推送中前辈故事的样本，然后决定分享哪些故事。观察到的故事样本取决于前辈分享的内容以及生成新闻推送的抽样算法。我们重点研究了这个算法如何选择更具病毒性（即被广泛分享）的故事的频率。向用户展示病毒性故事可以增加信息汇集，但也可能产生大多数分享故事错误的稳定状态。这些误导性的稳定状态自我持续，因为观察到错误故事的用户会形成错误的信念，从而理性地继续分享它们。最后，我们描述了平台设计和鲁棒性方面的若干后果。",
