    "abstract": "We present Cross-Client Label Propagation(XCLP), a new method for transductive federated learning. XCLP estimates a data graph jointly from the data of multiple clients and computes labels for the unlabeled data by propagating label information across the graph. To avoid clients having to share their data with anyone, XCLP employs two cryptographically secure protocols: secure Hamming distance computation and secure summation. We demonstrate two distinct applications of XCLP within federated learning. In the first, we use it in a one-shot way to predict labels for unseen test points. In the second, we use it to repeatedly pseudo-label unlabeled training data in a federated semi-supervised setting. Experiments on both real federated and standard benchmark datasets show that in both applications XCLP achieves higher classification accuracy than alternative approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的跨设备联邦学习方法：跨客户标签传播（XCLP）。XCLP通过多个客户端的数据共同估计数据图，并通过在图上传播标签信息来计算无标签数据的标签。为了避免客户端需要与他人共享数据，XCLP采用了两个密码学安全协议：安全的汉明距离计算和安全求和。我们展示了XCLP在联邦学习中的两个不同应用。在第一个应用中，我们使用它以一次性的方式预测未见测试点的标签。在第二个应用中，我们将其用于在联邦半监督设置中重复伪标记无标签训练数据。在真实的联邦和标准基准数据集上的实验证明，XCLP在这两个应用中比替代方法实现了更高的分类准确率。",
