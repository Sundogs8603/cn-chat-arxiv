    "translated_abstract": "复杂自然系统的工作机制往往服从简洁深刻的偏微分方程(PDE)。直接从数据中挖掘方程的方法被称为PDE发现，它揭示了一致的物理定律，并促进了我们与自然界的适应性互动。本文提出了一个增强的深度强化学习框架，以少量先前知识发现符号简洁的开放式PDE。特别地，基于基本运算符和操作数的符号库，设计了一个结构感知的递归神经网络代理，并与稀疏回归方法无缝结合，生成简洁而开放的PDE表达式。通过平衡数据适应性和简洁性的完美设计的奖励函数，对所有生成的PDE进行评估，并通过基于模型的强化学习高效地进行更新。定制的约束和规则用于保证PDE在术语上的合理性。",
