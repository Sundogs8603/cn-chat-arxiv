    "abstract": "PDDLStream solvers have recently emerged as viable solutions for Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) problems, extending PDDL to problems with continuous action spaces. Prior work has shown how PDDLStream problems can be reduced to a sequence of PDDL planning problems, which can then be solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, this approach can suffer from long runtimes. In this paper we propose LAZY, a solver for PDDLStream problems that maintains a single integrated search over action skeletons, which gets progressively more geometrically informed, as samples of possible motions are lazily drawn during motion planning. We explore how learned models of goal-directed policies and current motion sampling data can be incorporated in LAZY to adaptively guide the task planner. We show that this leads to significant speed-ups in the search for a feasible solution evaluated over unseen test environments of varying numbers of objects, goals, and initial conditions. We evaluate our TAMP appro",

    "translated_abstract": "PDDLStream求解器最近已经成为任务和动作规划（TAMP）问题的可行解决方案，将PDDL扩展到具有连续动作空间的问题。先前的工作已经展示了如何将PDDLStream问题简化为一系列PDDL规划问题，然后使用现成的规划器解决。然而，这种方法可能会导致长时间运行。在本文中，我们提出了LAZY，一种用于PDDLStream问题的求解器，它在动作骨架上维护单个集成搜索，随着在运动规划期间懒惰地绘制可能运动的样本，逐渐变得更具几何信息。我们探讨了如何将目标导向策略的学习模型和当前运动采样数据合并到LAZY中，以自适应地引导任务规划器。我们展示了这导致了在不同数量的对象、目标和初始条件的未见测试环境中评估可行解搜索的显着加速。我们评估了我们的TAMP方法",
