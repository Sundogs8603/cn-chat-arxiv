    "translated_abstract": "信息检索系统中页面呈现的偏见，尤其是点击行为方面的偏差，是一个众所周知的挑战，阻碍了使用隐式用户反馈来改进排序模型的性能。因此，提出了无偏学习排序(ULTR)算法，通过偏差点击数据来学习一个无偏的排序模型。然而，大多数现有算法特别设计用于减轻与位置相关的偏差，例如信任偏差，并未考虑到搜索结果页面呈现(SERP)中其他特征引发的偏差，例如由多媒体引发的吸引偏差。不幸的是，这些偏差在工业系统中广泛存在，可能导致不令人满意的搜索体验。因此，我们引入了一个新的问题，即整页无偏学习排序(WP-ULTR)，旨在同时处理整页SERP特征引发的偏差。这带来了巨大的挑战：(1) 很难找到适合的用户行为模型 (用户行为假设)；(2) 复杂的模型训练问题。",
