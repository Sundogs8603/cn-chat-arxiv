    "translated_abstract": "在医疗保健中利用基于语音的工具需要大规模的、经过筛选的数据集。由于制作这些数据集的成本昂贵，因此对数据共享产生了增加的兴趣。由于语音可能识别说话者（即声纹），分享录音引起了隐私问题。我们使用最先进的说话人识别系统，研究了无需参考人口统计或元数据的语音记录的重新识别风险。我们证明了风险与对手必须考虑的比较次数（即搜索空间）呈反相关关系。对于较小的搜索空间，风险较高，但随着搜索空间的增大（<1×10^6次比较），风险下降（精确度>0.85； >3×10^6次比较时，精确度<0.5）。接下来，我们展示了语音记录的性质如何影响重新识别的风险，非连续语音（例如音素延长）更难识别。我们的研究结果表明，说话人识别系统可以用于重新识别特定参与者。",
