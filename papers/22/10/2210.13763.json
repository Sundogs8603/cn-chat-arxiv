    "translated_abstract": "全球云广域网（WAN）的快速扩展给商业优化引擎带来了挑战，如何高效解决规模化的网络流量工程（TE）问题。现有的加速策略将TE优化分解为并发的子问题，但由于运行时间和分配性能之间的权衡，实现的并行化有限。本文提出了一种名为Teal的基于学习的TE算法，它利用GPU的并行处理能力加速TE控制。首先，Teal设计了一个以流为中心的图神经网络（GNN）来捕捉WAN连接和网络流量，学习流特征作为下游分配的输入。其次，为了减少问题规模并使学习可行，Teal采用了一种多智能体强化学习（RL）算法，独立分配每个流量需求，同时优化一个中心的TE目标。最后，Teal使用交替方向乘子法（ADMM）对分配进行微调，这是一种高效的方法。",
