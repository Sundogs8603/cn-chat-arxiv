    "translated_abstract": "鉴于密集检索模型在知识密集型自然语言处理任务上的有效性，这种模型变得越来越受欢迎。具体来说，开放域问答的事实上的架构使用两个同构编码器，从相同的预训练模型初始化，但分别为问题和段落参数化。这种双编码器架构在参数方面是低效的，因为在编码器之间没有参数共享。最近的研究表明，在各种设置中，这种密集检索器的性能低于BM25。因此，我们提出了一种新的架构，称为Task-aware Specialization for dense Retrieval(TASER)，它通过交错共享和专门化块在单个编码器中实现参数共享。我们在五个问答数据集上的实验表明，TASER可以在仅使用双编码器密集检索器约60%的参数的情况下，实现优越的准确性，超过BM25。在域外评估中，TASER也经验证实际上更具鲁棒性。",
