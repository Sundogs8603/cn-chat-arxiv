    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习中，设计一个公平的分类器以避免歧视不同群体是一个重要的问题。尽管研究人员已经提出了各种定义群体公平的方法，但大多数方法只关注了立即公平性，忽略了具有动态场景的公平分类器的长期影响，其中每个个体都可以随着时间的推移改善其特征。在这种动态设置中，长期公平应该在拒绝的样本花费一定的努力以改进后，平衡不同群体样本的特征分布。为了提高长期公平性，我们提出了一种新的公平性概念，称为Equal Improvability (EI)，其等化不同群体被拒绝样本在假定所有样本都将花费有限的努力来改进特征的情况下的潜在接受率。我们证明EI与现有的基于统计平等公平概念相兼容，并提出了一种训练分类器以实现EI的方法。在基准数据集上的实验表明，在长期公平方面，训练在EI下的分类器明显优于基线公平分类器。",

    "en_tdlr": "Designing a fair classifier in a dynamic environment is essential, and we propose a new fairness notion called Equal Improvability (EI) that ensures the balance of feature distribution across different groups after rejected samples make a certain level of effort to improve. This outperforms existing fairness notions in achieving long-term fairness."
