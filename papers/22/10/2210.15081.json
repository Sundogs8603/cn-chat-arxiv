    "translated_abstract": "多维标度（MDS）是一种广泛应用于表示高维、相关数据的方法。MDS通过为每个观测分配一个低维几何图形上的位置来工作，图形上的距离表示相似性。我们提出了一种贝叶斯方法来处理低维图形为双曲线的多维标度。使用双曲空间有助于表示许多场景中常见的树状结构（例如具有层次结构的文本或遗传数据）。贝叶斯方法提供了对观测数据中测量误差的最小化影响和不确定性评估的正则化。我们还提出了一种情况对照似然估计近似值，允许在更大的数据设置中从后验分布中高效采样，将计算复杂性从近似$O(n^2)$降低到$O(n)$。我们使用模拟、经典参考数据集、印度vil进行了对所提出的方法与业界最先进的方法进行了评估",
