We introduce NormSage, a framework for addressing the novel task of conversation-grounded multi-lingual, multi-cultural norm discovery, based on language model prompting and self-verification. NormSAGE leverages the expressiveness and implicit knowledge of the pretrained GPT-3 language model backbone, to elicit knowledge about norms through directed questions representing the norm discovery task and conversation context. It further addresses the risk of language model hallucination with a self-verification mechanism ensuring that the norms discovered are correct and are substantially grounded to their source conversations. Evaluation results show that our approach discovers significantly more relevant and insightful norms for conversations on-the-fly compared to baselines (>10+% in Likert scale rating).

    "translated_abstract": "规范发现对于理解和推理人类交流和互动中可接受的行为和潜在违规行为非常重要。我们介绍了NormSage，一个用于解决新颖任务的框架，即基于语言模型提示和自验证的对话驱动的多语言多文化规范发现。NormSAGE利用预训练的GPT-3语言模型架构的表达能力和隐式知识，通过针对规范发现任务和对话背景的有向问题引发关于规范的知识。它还通过自验证机制解决语言模型虚构的风险，确保发现的规范是正确的，并且在很大程度上与它们的源对话相关。评估结果显示，与基准相比，我们的方法能够在实时对话中发现更多相关且有洞察力的规范（Likert评分中增加了10%以上）。",
