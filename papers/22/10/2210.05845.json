    "abstract": "In real life, success is often contingent upon multiple critical steps that are distant in time from each other and from the final reward. These critical steps are challenging to identify with traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods that rely on the Bellman equation for credit assignment. Here, we present a new RL algorithm that uses offline contrastive learning to hone in on critical steps. This algorithm, which we call contrastive introspection (ConSpec), can be added to any existing RL algorithm. ConSpec learns a set of prototypes for the critical steps in a task by a novel contrastive loss and delivers an intrinsic reward when the current state matches one of these prototypes. The prototypes in ConSpec provide two key benefits for credit assignment: (1) They enable rapid identification of all the critical steps. (2) They do so in a readily interpretable manner, enabling out-of-distribution generalization when sensory features are altered. Distinct from other contemporary RL",

    "translated_abstract": "在现实生活中，成功往往取决于多个关键步骤，这些步骤在时间上相距较远，与最终奖励也相距甚远。传统的强化学习方法在信用分配方面依赖Bellman方程，很难识别这些关键步骤。本文提出了一种新的强化学习算法，使用离线对比学习来确定关键步骤。这个算法被称为对比内省（ConSpec），可以添加到任何现有的强化学习算法中。ConSpec通过一种新颖的对比损失学习任务中的关键步骤的原型，并在当前状态与这些原型之一匹配时提供内在奖励。ConSpec中的原型在信用分配方面具有两个关键优势：（1）它们使得能够迅速识别所有关键步骤；（2）它们以容易解释的方式实现这一点，使得在感觉特征改变时可以进行超出分布的泛化。与其他当代的强化学习方法不同，",
