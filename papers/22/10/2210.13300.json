    "translated_abstract": "因果算子（CO）在当代随机分析中扮演着重要角色，例如各种随机微分方程的解算子。然而，目前还没有一个能够逼近CO的深度学习（DL）模型的规范框架。本文通过引入一个DL模型设计框架来提出一个“几何感知”的解决方案，该框架以合适的无限维线性度量空间为输入，并返回适应这些线性几何的通用连续序列DL模型。我们称这些模型为因果神经算子（CNO）。我们的主要结果表明，我们的框架所产生的模型可以在紧致集上和跨任意有限时间视野上一致逼近Hölder或平滑迹类算子，这些算子因果地映射给定线性度量空间之间的序列。我们的分析揭示了关于CNO的潜在状态空间维度的新定量关系，甚至对于（经典的）有限维DL模型也有新的影响。",
