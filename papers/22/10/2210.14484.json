We introduce a new imputation method based on the existing stacked penalized logistic regression (StaPLR) algorithm for multi-view learning.

We compare the performance of the new imputation method with several existing imputation algorithms in simulated data sets.

    "translated_abstract": "多视角数据是指由多个不同特征集描述的数据。在处理多视角数据时，若出现缺失值，则一个视角中的所有特征极有可能同时缺失，因而导致非常大量的缺失数据问题。本文提出了一种新的多视角学习算法中的插补方法，它基于堆叠惩罚逻辑回归(StaPLR)算法，在降维空间中执行插补，以解决固有的多视角计算挑战。实验结果表明，该方法在模拟数据集上具有竞争性结果，而且具有更低的计算成本，从而可以使用先进的插补算法，例如missForest。",
