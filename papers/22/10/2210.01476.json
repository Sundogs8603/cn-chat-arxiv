The observer then estimates the system's state in the original coordinates by inverting the transformation map. However, finding a suitable injective transformation whose inverse can be derived remains a primary challenge for general nonlinear systems. We propose a novel approach that uses supervised physics-informed neural networks to approximate both the transformation and its inverse.

    "translated_abstract": "设计非线性系统的 Luenberger 观测器涉及将状态转换到一种可渐近稳定且在输出注入方面是线性的备选坐标系，可能是更高维度的。然后，观测器通过反转转换映射在原始坐标系中估计系统的状态。然而，对于一般的非线性系统，找到一个适合的可逆变换仍然是一个主要挑战。我们提出了一种新方法，使用受监督的物理学知识神经网络来近似转换及其反演。该方法展现了比现有方法更优秀的泛化能力，并且对于神经网络的近似误差与系统不确定性具有鲁棒性。",
