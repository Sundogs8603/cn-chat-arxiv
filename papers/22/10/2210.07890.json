    "translated_abstract": "在杂乱、密集和动态的环境中进行运动生成是机器人领域的一个核心问题，被视为一个多目标决策问题。当前的方法在安全和性能之间进行权衡。一方面，反应式策略保证了对环境变化的快速响应，但以次优的行为作为代价。另一方面，基于规划的运动生成提供可行的轨迹，但高计算成本可能会限制控制频率，从而牺牲安全性。为了结合反应式策略和规划的优点，我们提出了一种分层运动生成方法。此外，我们采用概率推理方法来正式化分层模型和随机优化。我们将这种方法实现为随机反应式专家策略的加权乘积，其中规划被用于自适应计算任务周期内的最优权重。这种随机优化避免了局部最优，并提出了可行的反应式计划，找到路径。",
