    "translated_abstract": "准确预测城市轨道交通的客流对于提高智能交通系统的性能尤为重要，尤其是在疫情期间。如何动态建模客流的复杂时空依赖关系是实现准确客流预测的主要问题。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种全新的基于transformer的架构，称为ST-former，专门用于COVID-19期间的客流预测。具体而言，我们开发了一种改进的自注意机制，命名为因果卷积ProbSparse自注意（CPSA），以低计算成本建模客流的多个时间依赖关系。为了捕捉复杂且动态的空间依赖关系，我们引入了一种新颖的自适应多图卷积网络（AMGCN），通过以自适应的方式利用多个图来进行建模。另外，多源数据融合模块将客流数据、COVID-19确诊病例等多种数据进行融合。",
