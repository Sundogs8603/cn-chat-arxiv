    "translated_abstract": "随着对PM2.5或PM0.3问题的关注不断增加，颗粒物不仅对环境和人类构成潜在威胁，而且对国际空间站上的仪器也会产生不利影响。本研究团队旨在将各种颗粒物浓度与磁场、湿度、加速度、温度、压力和CO2浓度关联起来。我们的目标是建立一个早期预警系统(EWS)，能够预测颗粒物水平，并为宇航员提供充足的反应时间，以保护他们在某些实验中的仪器，或者提高测量的准确性；此外，所构建的模型还可以进一步发展为与火灾相关的遥感烟雾报警装置的原型。本文中，我们将实现Bi-GRU(双向门控循环单元)算法，收集过去90分钟的数据，并预测超过2.5微米的颗粒物水平。",
