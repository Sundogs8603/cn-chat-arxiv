    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了障碍哈密尔顿蒙特卡罗(BHMC)，它是HMC算法的一种变体，旨在从带有自共轭障碍度量的流形中的Gibbs分布π中进行采样。该方法依赖于包含度量的Hamiltonian动力学。因此，它包含定义流形的约束，并能够利用其底层几何形状。然而，相应的Hamilton动力学是通过不可分离的常微分方程来定义的，与欧几里得情况相反。这意味着将HMC推广到黎曼流形中会产生不可避免的偏差。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的过滤步骤，称为“involution检查步骤”。该步骤在两个BHMC版本——连续BHMC(c-BHMC)和数值BHMC(n-BHMC)中实现。我们的主要结果表明，这两个新算法生成可逆Markov链且无偏。",
