    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new and simple method for comparing speech utterances without relying on text transcripts. Our speech-to-speech comparison metric utilizes state-of-the-art speech2unit encoders like HuBERT to convert speech utterances into discrete acoustic units. We then propose a simple and easily replicable neural architecture that learns a speech-based metric that closely corresponds to its text-based counterpart. This textless metric has numerous potential applications, including evaluating speech-to-speech translation for oral languages, languages without dependable ASR systems, or to avoid the need for ASR transcription altogether. This paper also shows that for speech-to-speech translation evaluation, ASR-BLEU (which consists in automatically transcribing both speech hypothesis and reference and compute sentence-level BLEU between transcripts) is a poor proxy to real text-BLEU even when ASR system is strong.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新的简单方法，用于比较语音表述而无需依赖文本转录。我们的语音对语音比较度量利用了最先进的语音到单元编码器（如HuBERT）将语音表述转换为离散的声学单元。然后，我们提出了一种简单易复制的神经架构，学习一种与文本基准度量密切对应的基于语音的度量。这种无文本度量具有许多潜在应用，包括评估口头语言、没有可靠ASR系统的语言的语音翻译，或者完全避免使用ASR转录的需求。本文还表明，在语音翻译评估中，ASR-BLEU（通过自动转录语音假设和参考语音，并计算转录之间的句子级BLEU）即使ASR系统强大，也是真实文本BLEU的一个较差代理。",
