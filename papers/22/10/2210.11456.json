    "translated_abstract": "最近自监督学习的进展将Masked Image Modeling（MIM）和Siamese网络整合成一个统一的框架，利用了两种技术的优点。然而，在Siamese ConvNets中应用传统的基于擦除的遮盖策略时，存在一些未解决的问题，包括（I）在连续处理数据时不能放弃不相关的遮盖区域，导致训练效率低于ViT模型;（II）基于擦除的遮盖与Siamese ConvNets中的对比学习目标不匹配，与MIM方法不同。本文提出了一种称为MixMask的填充式遮盖策略，以防止香草遮盖方法中图像中的随机遮盖区域导致信息不完整。此外，我们引入了一种灵活的损失函数设计，考虑两个不同混合视图之间的语义距离变化，以适应集成架构并防止遮盖和对比学习目标之间的不匹配。实验表明，MixMask显着提高了Siamese ConvNets的性能，并在几个基准测试中实现了最先进的结果。",
