    "translated_abstract": "在机器人学中，优化控制器参数并满足安全约束是一个重要的挑战。安全贝叶斯优化通过量化目标和约束中的不确定性来安全地指导探索。然而，在存在未知安全约束的情况下，选择可靠的模型超参数以避免安全违规至关重要，但人工设计适合的概率模型可能很具有挑战性。本文提出了一种数据驱动的方法，通过元学习先验从离线数据中实现安全的贝叶斯优化。我们借助元学习算法 F-PACOH，在数据稀缺性的情况下提供可靠的不确定性量化。同时，在基准函数和高精度运动系统上，我们通过经验不确定度度量和前沿搜索算法开发了一种新的框架，以数据驱动的方式选择符合安全要求的先验。实验结果表明，相比于基准方法，我们的元学习先验加快了安全贝叶斯优化的收敛速度并改进了整体性能。",
