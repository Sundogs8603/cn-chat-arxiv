    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑从观测数据中估计贝叶斯网络的边际独立结构的问题，这些数据以一个无向图的形式呈现，被称为无条件依赖图。我们证明了贝叶斯网络的无条件依赖图对应于具有相等独立性和交集数的图。基于这一观察结果，我们给出了与贝叶斯网络的无条件依赖图相关的一个拓扑理想的 Gröbner 基础，然后通过额外的二项式关系将其扩展以连接所有这些图的空间。我们实现了一种名为 GrUES (Gröbner-based Unconditional Equivalence Search) 的 MCMC 方法，该方法基于所得的移动并应用于合成高斯数据。GrUES 以比简单的独立性测试更高的速率恢复真实的边际独立结构，同时还产生了一个包括真实结构的后验估计，其中 $20\\%$ 的 HPD 置信区间包含真实结构。",
