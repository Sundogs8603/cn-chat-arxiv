    "translated_abstract": "秩约束优化问题(RCOP)是最小化线性目标函数在一个预先指定的秩约束域集和m个通用的双边线性矩阵不等式上。受Dantzig-Wolfe (DW)分解的启发，我们研究了DW松弛(DWR)在RCOP中的强度，其与RCOP具有相同的表达式，只是将域集替换为其闭凸包。值得注意的是，我们的目标是确定使DWR与任何m个双边线性矩阵不等式相匹配的条件。从原始的角度出发，我们首次确定同时必要和充分的条件，以达到：(i)极端点的准确性——DWR可行集的所有极端点属于RCOP的极端点;(ii)凸包的准确性——DWR可行集等同于RCOP可行集的闭凸包; (iii)目标的准确性——优化的目标值在DWR可行集和RCOP可行集的闭凸包之间确切匹配。",
