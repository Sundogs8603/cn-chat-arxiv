We introduce a generative shape model for complex anatomical structures, learnable from datasets of unpaired datasets. The proposed generative model can synthesise complete whole complex shape assemblies coined virtual chimaeras, as opposed to natural human chimaeras.

    "translated_abstract": "生成捕获足够变异性且保持合理的虚拟解剖人群对于进行医疗器械的硅中试验证是至关重要的。然而，并非每个个体都拥有所需的解剖形状。因此，在人群中常常存在缺失/部分重叠的解剖信息。我们引入了一个针对复杂解剖结构的生成形状模型，可以从未配对数据集中学习。所提出的生成模型能够合成完整的复杂形状集合，称为虚拟奇美拉，与自然人类奇美拉相对。我们将该框架应用于从整个心形组件数据库中构建虚拟奇美拉，其中每个奇美拉贡献心脏次级结构的样本。具体而言，我们提出了一个生成形状组合框架，包括两个组件 - 一个部分感知的生成形状",
