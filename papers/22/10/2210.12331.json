    "translated_abstract": "阿尔茨海默病是一种神经退行性疾病，可能导致痴呆和严重的大脑功能下降，如果没有预防性护理，会抑制简单任务的完成。逾9分之1的美国人患有由AD引起的痴呆症，未得到报酬的AD相关痴呆患者护理价值为2716亿美元。因此，为防止AD进一步进展，已开发了各种方法进行早期AD诊断。在本文中，我们首先回顾了其他可用于早期AD检测的方法。然后我们介绍了我们的数据集，该数据集来自阿尔茨海默病神经影像学倡议（ADNI），并提出了一个由7866819个参数组成的深度卷积神经网络架构。该模型具有三个不同的卷积分支，每个分支的长度不同。每个分支由不同的卷积核大小组成。该模型可以预测患有非痴呆、轻度痴呆或中度痴呆的患者，其三分类准确率为99.05％。",
