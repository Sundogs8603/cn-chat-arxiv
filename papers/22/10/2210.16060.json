    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种针对大规模高动态范围计算成像的新方法。通过端到端训练的深度神经网络（DNN）几乎可以瞬间解决线性反演成像问题。虽然展开的架构对于测量设置的变化具有鲁棒性，但在DNN架构中嵌入大规模测量运算符是不实际的。替代的即插即用（PnP）方法对可扩展性和高动态范围的挑战证明是有效的，但依赖于高度迭代的算法。我们提出了一种残差DNN系列方法，也可以解释为学习版的匹配追踪，其中重建的图像是逐步增加动态范围的残余图像的和，通过DNN迭代地估计，以前一次迭代的反投影数据残差作为输入。我们在射电天文成像模拟中证明，仅有几个项的系列就可以提供较好的结果。",
