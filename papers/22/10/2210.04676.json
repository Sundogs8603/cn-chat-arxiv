    "translated_abstract": "随着命名实体的类别迅速增加，部署的NER模型需要不断更新以识别更多的实体类型，这就需要对NER进行类增量学习。考虑到隐私问题和存储约束，类增量NER的标准范式仅使用带有新类别注释的训练数据更新模型，而来自其他实体类别的实体被标记为\"非实体\"（或\"O\"）。本文对\"未标记实体问题\"进行了实证研究，发现它导致\"O\"和实体之间严重混淆，降低了旧类别的分类能力，并降低了模型学习新类别的能力。为了解决未标记实体问题，我们提出了一种新的表示学习方法，学习实体类别和\"O\"的判别表示。具体而言，我们提出了一种实体感知的对比学习方法，在representation learning方面进行了改进。",
