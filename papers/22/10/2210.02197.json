    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19的疾病严重程度从无症状到需要住院不等。了解导致疾病严重程度的机制对于开发有效的治疗方法和降低死亡率至关重要。一种获得这种理解的方法是使用多类别分类框架，其中使用患者的生物特征来预测患者的严重程度类别。在这个严重程度分类问题中，有利于优先识别更严重的类别并控制“次级分类”错误，即将患者错误分类为更轻微的类别。Neyman-Pearson (NP)分类范式已经被开发出来优先处理指定类型的错误。然而，目前的NP过程要么适用于二元分类，要么在多类别分类中无法高概率控制优先错误。在这里，我们提出了一种分层NP (H-NP)框架和一个通用的算法，并通过实验表明其优于现有方法。",
