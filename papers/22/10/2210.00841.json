    "translated_abstract": "多域图像转换可以根据目标域的风格将源图像进行转换。这些变换的重要特征之一是graduality，即当它们各自的潜在空间表示被线性插值时，源图像和目标图像之间的平滑变化。然而，尽管现有方法可以在内部域上线性插值得到非常逼真的结果，但在评估跨域插值时通常表现不佳，经常产生外观突变或非真实中间图像。本文认为，这个问题的主要原因之一是缺乏足够的跨域训练数据，因此提出了两种不同的正则化方法来缓解这个问题：一种新的收缩损失，它可以压缩潜在空间；一种Mixup数据增强策略，它可以使域之间的样式表示变得平坦。还提出了一种新的度量标准来定量评估插值平滑度，通过测量中间图像与一种更昂贵的基于优化的方法得到的图像之间的感知相似度来完成。",
