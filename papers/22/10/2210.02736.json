This work represents a first attempt to provide empirical evidences about this relationship. Through the application of a non-parametrical method, we first assess the efficiency of the Italian airports industry.

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2210.02736v2 公告类型：替换  摘要：转向更环保的生产流程和管理实践是一个日益重要的课题。许多行业需要进行根本性改变，以满足环境可持续性要求；旅游业也不例外。在这方面，需要进一步关注的一个特定方面是机场绩效与环境可持续政策投资之间的关系。本研究是首次尝试提供关于这种关系的实证证据。通过应用非参数方法，我们首先评估意大利机场业的效率。其次，我们使用Tobit回归模型调查了机场绩效与管理对生态转型的承诺之间的关系。研究结果显示，机场遵守正式的多年生态转型计划对其产生了积极和一致的影响。",
