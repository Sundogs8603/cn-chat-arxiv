    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了具有接受/拒绝决策和T次独立同分布到达的经典网络收入管理（NRM）问题。我们考虑了一个分布形式，每个到达必须属于有限数量的可能类别之一，每个类别具有确定的资源消耗向量，但是一个在区间上连续分布的随机值。我们开发了一种在线算法，该算法在此模型下实现了O(log^2 T)的遗憾，唯一（必要）的假设是概率密度远离0。我们得到了第二个结果，在二阶增长的额外假设下，实现了O(log T)的遗憾。据我们所知，这是第一个在没有任何“退化”假设的情况下，在具有连续值的NRM模型中实现对数级别遗憾的结果。我们的结果是通过包括一种新的边界mypopic regret，离线分配的“半流体”放松以及改进边界的新技术实现的。",
