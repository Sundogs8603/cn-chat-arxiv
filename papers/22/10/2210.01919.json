    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑通过逐渐逼近一致函数（support function）的子线性回归方法，从有限数据中估计一个紧致集合。支撑函数在凸封闭运算的意义下能够唯一地刻画一个紧致集合，而且是子线性（凸以及一次正齐次的）。相反，任何子线性函数都是一个紧致集合的支撑函数。我们利用这一性质，将学习一个紧致集合的任务转化为学习它的支撑函数。为了进行子线性回归，我们提出了两种算法，一种是通过凸规划求解二次规划（QP）得到支撑函数，另一种是通过训练子线性神经网络实现非凸规划得到支撑函数。并通过数值实验展示了这些算法在轨迹数据中学习具有集合值输入不确定性的受控动态到达集的应用。",
