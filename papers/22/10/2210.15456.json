    "abstract": "Commonsense reasoning simulates the human ability to make presumptions about our physical world, and it is an essential cornerstone in building general AI systems. We propose a new commonsense reasoning dataset based on human's Interactive Fiction (IF) gameplay walkthroughs as human players demonstrate plentiful and diverse commonsense reasoning. The new dataset provides a natural mixture of various reasoning types and requires multi-hop reasoning. Moreover, the IF game-based construction procedure requires much less human interventions than previous ones. Different from existing benchmarks, our dataset focuses on the assessment of functional commonsense knowledge rules rather than factual knowledge. Hence, in order to achieve higher performance on our tasks, models need to effectively utilize such functional knowledge to infer the outcomes of actions, rather than relying solely on memorizing facts. Experiments show that the introduced dataset is challenging to previous machine reading",

    "translated_abstract": "常识推理模拟了人类对我们物理世界的推断能力，是构建通用人工智能系统的基石。本文提出了一个新的常识推理数据集，基于人类互动小说游戏的步骤演示，因为人类玩家展示了丰富和多样的常识推理。该新数据集提供了各种推理类型的自然混合，并需要多跳推理。此外，IF游戏构建过程需要比以前的方法更少的人类干预。与现有的基准不同，我们的数据集侧重于评估功能性的常识知识规则，而不是事实知识。因此，为了在我们的任务上获得更高的性能，模型需要有效地利用这种功能性知识来推断行动的结果，而不是仅依靠记忆事实。实验表明，引入的数据集对于先前的机器阅读来说具有挑战性。",
