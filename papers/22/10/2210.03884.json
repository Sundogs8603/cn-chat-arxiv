    "abstract": "As a critical step to achieve human-like chatbots, empathetic response generation has attained increasing interests. Previous attempts are incomplete and not sufficient enough to elicit empathy because they only focus on the initial aspect of empathy to automatically mimic the feelings and thoughts of the user via other-awareness. However, they ignore to maintain and take the own views of the system into account, which is a crucial process to achieve the empathy called self-other awareness. To this end, we propose to generate Empathetic response with explicit Self-Other Awareness (EmpSOA). Specifically, three stages, self-other differentiation, self-other modulation and self-other generation, are devised to clearly maintain, regulate and inject the self-other aware information into the process of empathetic response generation. Both automatic and human evaluations on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the superiority of EmpSOA to generate more empathetic responses.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了实现类似于人的聊天机器人，共情回应的生成成为了一个关键步骤。之前的尝试不够完整，不能引起共情，因为它们只关注于通过其他感知来自动模仿用户的情绪和思想。然而，它们忽略了维持和考虑系统自身观点的重要过程，这是实现自我他人意识的共情关键。为此，我们提出了使用明确的自我他人意识（EmpSOA）生成共情回应。具体地，设计了三个阶段：自我他人区别、自我他人调节和自我他人生成，以清晰地维护、调节和注入自我他人感知信息到共情回应生成的过程中。基准数据集上的自动和人工评估均表明，EmpSOA生成了更具共情的回应，具有明显的优越性。",
