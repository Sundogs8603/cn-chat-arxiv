    "translated_abstract": "同步本地随机梯度下降（local SGD）会因为一些工作单元空闲并因慢工或落后工人而存在一些随机延迟，因为它在等待工人完成相同数量的本地更新。本文提出了一种新的本地SGD策略——STSyn，以减轻落后者和提高通信效率。关键是等待$K$个最快的工人，同时让所有工人在每个同步循环中始终计算，并充分利用每个工人的有效（已完成）本地更新，无论是否存在落后者。文章提供了关于STSyn性能的平均挂钟时间、本地更新的平均数量和每轮上传工人的平均数量的分析。即使目标函数是非凸的，STSyn的收敛性也得到了严格的证明。实验结果显示，通过使用容错同步技术，所提出的STSyn优于现有的最先进方案。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a local SGD strategy named STSyn, which mitigates stragglers and improves communication efficiency by waiting for the fastest workers and making full use of every worker's effective local updates through straggler-tolerant synchronization technique. The proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art schemes."
