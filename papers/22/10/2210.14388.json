    "translated_abstract": "考虑Shapley和Scarf（1974）的对象分配（单边匹配）模型。当观察到最终分配但代理的偏好未知时，什么情况下分配可能在核心中？这是Echenique，Lee，Shum和Yenmez（2013）模型的单边模拟。我建立了一个模型，在这个模型中，严格的核心是可以测试的，即如果存在一个偏好配置把它置于核心中，则分配是“合理化”的。通过这种方式，我发展了一种单边匹配的显露偏好理论。我在非可转让和可转让效用设置中研究了合理性。在非可转让效用设置中，只有当具有相同偏好的代理处于相同的潜在交易周期中时，他们才会获得相同的分配，这时分配是合理化的。在可转让效用设置中，只有当存在一个价格向量支持分配作为竞争均衡时，分配才是合理化的。",
