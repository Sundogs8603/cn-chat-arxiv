    "translated_abstract": "Alzheimer病(AD)是一种异质性的、多因素引起的神经退行性疾病，以β-淀粉样蛋白、病理性tau蛋白和神经退化为特征。目前对于晚期阿尔茨海默病没有有效的治疗方法，迫切需要早期干预。然而，现有的AD亚型识别的统计推断方法忽视了病理学领域的知识，可能会导致病情不明确且与基本神经学原则不一致的结果。我们提出了一种新的基于病理学引导的分层网络(PSSN)的方法，通过反应扩散模型将已建立的AD病理学知识与机器学习相结合，考虑主要生物标志物之间的非线性相互作用和沿脑结构网络的扩散。通过对纵向多模态神经影像数据进行训练，生物模型可以预测捕捉到个体发展模式的长期轨迹，填补了当前缺失的神经病理学信息。",
