    "translated_abstract": "量子近似优化算法（QAOA）是展示近期量子计算机具备量子优势的主要方法之一。然而，高设备误差率限制了我们对于超过几个量子比特的问题可靠地运行QAOA电路。在QAOA中，问题图被转换为一个量子电路，其中每条边对应于电路每层中的两个2量子比特CNOT操作。由于CNOT极易出错，因此QAOA电路的保真度由问题图中边的数量决定。我们观察到，大多数对应于实际应用的图遵循“幂律”分布，其中一些热点节点具有显着更高的连接数。我们利用这一洞见并提出“FrozenQubits”，冻结热点节点或量子比特，将给定问题的状态空间智能地分成几个较小的子空间，然后独立地解决它们。",
