Key challenges of MCTS-based MBRL methods remain dedicated deep exploration and reliability in the face of the unknown, and both challenges can be alleviated through principled epistemic uncertainty estimation in the predictions of MCTS. We present two main contributions: First, we develop methodology to propagate epistemic uncertainty in MCTS, enabling agents to estimate the epistemic uncertainty in their predictions.
