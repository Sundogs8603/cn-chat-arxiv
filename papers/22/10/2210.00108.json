    "translated_abstract": "早期的后门攻击引起了攻防开发中的一场竞争。防御手段已经出现，并展示了在模型中检测和移除后门的能力。这些防御手段通过检查训练数据、模型或训练过程的完整性来工作。在这项工作中，我们展示了后门可以在编译过程中添加，绕过了数据准备和模型训练阶段的任何保护措施。攻击者不仅可以在编译过程中插入已有的基于权重的后门，还可以插入一种新的与权重无关的后门，例如ImpNet。这些后门在训练或数据准备过程中是不可检测的，因为它们尚不存在。接下来，我们展示了一些后门，包括ImpNet，只能在插入它们的阶段可靠地检测到，而在其他任何地方移除它们都是一个重大挑战。我们得出结论，机器学习模型的安全性需要保证。",
