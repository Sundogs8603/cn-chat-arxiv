    "translated_abstract": "深度强化学习（RL）为自主机器人导航带来了许多成功。然而，仍存在一些重要的限制，阻止了基于RL的导航系统在现实世界中的应用。例如，大多数学习方法缺乏安全保证；而学习到的导航系统可能不适用于未知环境。尽管最近出现了各种学习技术来应对这些挑战，但缺乏针对自主导航的开源基准测试和可重复学习方法，使得机器人学家难以选择用于其移动机器人的学习方法，学习研究人员也难以确定当前通用学习方法在自主导航方面的不足之处。在本文中，我们确定了应用深度RL方法进行自主导航的四个主要期望：（D1）不确定性推理、（D2）安全性、（D3）从有限的试错数据中学习、（D4）对多样和新颖环境的泛化能力。",
