    "translated_abstract": "最先进的人脸识别系统需要大量的标注训练数据。由于人脸识别应用中隐私的优先级，数据限制在名人网络爬虫上，其中存在身份有限的问题。另一方面，自监督革命激发了将相关技术应用于人脸识别的研究。最流行的实用技巧之一是通过从生成模型中绘制样本来增加数据集，同时保留身份信息。我们表明，基于对StyleGAN进行微调的pSp编码器的简单方法能够提高最先进的人脸识别技术，并与对合成人脸身份进行训练相比表现更好。我们还收集了具有可控族裔构成的大规模无标签数据集--AfricanFaceSet-5M（包含500万张不同人的图像）和AsianFaceSet-3M（包含300万张不同人的图像）--并展示了在每个数据集上进行预训练。",
