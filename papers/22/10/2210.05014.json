    "abstract": "arXiv:2210.05014v3 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: In recent years, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) has achieved widespread adoption within the game community. Its use in conjunction with deep reinforcement learning has produced success stories in many applications. While these approaches have been implemented in various games, from simple board games to more complicated video games such as StarCraft, the use of deep neural networks requires a substantial training period. In this work, we explore on-line adaptivity in MCTS without requiring pre-training. We present MCTS-TD, an adaptive MCTS algorithm improved with temporal difference learning. We demonstrate our new approach on the game miniXCOM, a simplified version of XCOM, a popular commercial franchise consisting of several turn-based tactical games, and show how adaptivity in MCTS-TD allows for improved performances against opponents.",

    "translated_abstract": "在近年来，蒙特卡罗树搜索（MCTS）在游戏社区中得到了广泛应用。与深度强化学习结合使用在许多应用中取得了成功。在各种游戏中实施了这些方法，从简单的棋盘游戏到更复杂的视频游戏，如星际争霸，而深度神经网络的使用则需要大量的训练时间。在这项工作中，我们探讨了MCTS中的在线适应性，而不需要预训练。我们提出了MCTS-TD，这是一种使用时间差异学习改进的自适应MCTS算法。我们在游戏miniXCOM上展示了我们的新方法，这是XCOM的一个简化版本，XCOM是一个包含多款回合制战术游戏的流行商业系列，展示了MCTS-TD中的适应性如何提高了与对手的表现。",
