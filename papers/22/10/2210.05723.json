    "translated_abstract": "各种神经网络架构依靠汇聚运算符来聚合来自不同来源的信息。在这种情况下，通常默认向量编码为认识状态，即向量捕捉到已获取有关某些感兴趣属性的证据，并且汇聚这些向量会得到一个结合这些证据的向量。我们研究了一系列标准汇聚运算符，在什么条件下它们与这个被称为认识汇聚原则的想法兼容。我们发现所有考虑的汇聚运算符都可以满足认识汇聚原则，但这仅在嵌入具有足够高维度的情况下成立，对于大多数汇聚运算符，嵌入需要满足特定约束（例如具有非负坐标）。此外，我们还展示了这些约束对嵌入在实践中的使用具有重要影响。特别是，我们发现当认识汇聚原则不能被满足时，使用一个无约束的稀疏解更好。",
