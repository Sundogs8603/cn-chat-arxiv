    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新的任务来评估具有场景理解能力的代理人：三维场景中的情境问答（SQA3D）。给定一个场景上下文（例如三维扫描），SQA3D要求经过测试的代理人首先理解其在文本描述下的3D场景中的情境（位置、方向等），然后在该情境下进行推理，回答一个问题。基于来自ScanNet的650个场景，我们提供了一个数据集，其中心围绕6.8k个唯一情境，20.4k的描述和33.4k多样的推理问题。这些问题涵盖了对智能代理人范围广泛的推理能力的考察，从空间关系理解到常识理解、导航和多跳推理。SQA3D对当前的多模式尤其是3D推理模型提出了重大挑战。我们评估了各种最先进的方法，并发现最佳结果仅达到了47.20%的总体得分，而业余水平的表现更为糟糕。",
