    "abstract": "arXiv:2210.04047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: In this thesis, we propose an alternative characterization of the notion of Configuration Space, which we call Visual Configuration Space (VCS). This new characterization allows an embodied agent (e.g., a robot) to discover its own body structure and plan obstacle-free motions in its peripersonal space using a set of its own images in random poses. Here, we do not assume any knowledge of geometry of the agent, obstacles or the environment. We demonstrate the usefulness of VCS in (a) building and working with geometry-free models for robot motion planning, (b) explaining how a human baby might learn to reach objects in its peripersonal space through motor babbling, and (c) automatically generating natural looking head motion animations for digital avatars in virtual environments. This work is based on the formalism of manifolds and manifold learning using the agent's images and hence we call it Motion Planning on Visual Manifold",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们提出了对配置空间概念的替代性刻画，我们称之为视觉配置空间（VCS）。这种新的描述允许一个具有身体结构的实体代理（如机器人）使用其随机姿势的一组图像来发现自己的身体结构，并在其周边空间中规划无障碍运动。这里，我们不假设实体代理、障碍物或环境的几何知识。我们展示了VCS 在（a）建立和处理几何无关模型用于机器人运动规划，（b）解释人类婴儿如何通过运动胡言来学习抓取其周边空间中的物体，以及（c）自动生成虚拟环境中数字化化身人物的自然头部动作动画的实用性。这项工作基于流形的形式化和流形学习，使用代理的图像，因此我们将其称为在视觉流形上的运动规划。",
