    "translated_abstract": "本文扩展了Chen和Li（2009a）以及Kasahara和Shimotsu（2015）提出的期望最大化（EM）检验方法，将其应用于面板数据的正态混合回归模型中，从而开发了基于似然比检验的M0组分模型与(M0+1)组分模型的检验方法。我们发现，与横截面正态混合模型不同的是，面板正态混合模型方差参数的密度函数的一阶导数与均值参数的二阶导数线性无关。另一方面，与横截面正态混合模型类似，面板正态混合模型的似然比检验统计量是无界的。我们通过计算实验获得数据驱动惩罚函数，采用带惩罚的最大似然估计方法处理无界问题。我们通过扩展对数似然的泰勒级数展开式，导出了惩罚最大似然比检验（PLRT）和EM测试统计量的渐近分布性质。",
