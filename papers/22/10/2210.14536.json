However, little work has been done on adapting such methods to track consistently multiple sources appearing and disappearing, as would occur in reality. In this paper, we present a new training strategy for deep learning SSL models with a straightforward implementation based on the mean squared error of the optimal association between estimated and reference positions in the preceding time frames. It optimizes the desired properties of a tracking system: handling a time-varying number of sources and ordering localization estimates according to their trajectories, minimizing identity switches (IDSs). Evaluation on simulated data of multiple reverberant moving sources and on two model architectures proves its effectiveness on reducing identity switches without compromising frame-wise localization accuracy.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于数据和学习的声源定位（SSL）方法在具有挑战性的声学环境中展现出强大的性能。然而，很少有研究采用这些方法来持续跟踪出现和消失的多个声源，就像在现实中一样。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的培训策略，用于基于深度学习的SSL模型，其直接实现基于先前时间帧中估计和参考位置之间的最优关联的均方误差。它优化了跟踪系统的期望特性：处理时变的多个声源，并根据它们的轨迹排序定位估计，最小化身份切换(IDS)。在模拟多个混响移动来源的数据和两个模型架构的评估中，证明了它在减少身份切换的同时不损失逐帧定位精度的有效性。",
