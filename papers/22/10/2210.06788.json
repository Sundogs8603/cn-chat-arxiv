    "translated_abstract": "主动学习旨在在有限预算下从未标记的数据池中选择最有用的数据样本并对其进行注释，以扩展标记数据集。尤其是基于不确定性的方法选择最不确定的样本，在改善模型性能方面已被证明是有效的。然而，主动学习文献经常忽视训练动力学（TD），即通过随机梯度下降进行优化时模型行为的不断变化，尽管文献的其他领域经验证明TD提供了衡量样本不确定性的重要线索。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的主动学习方法，即训练动力学主动学习（TiDAL），它利用TD来量化未标记数据的不确定性。由于跟踪大规模未标记数据的TD是不切实际的，所以TiDAL利用一个额外的预测模块来学习标记数据的TD。为了进一步证明TiDAL的设计，我们提供了理论和实证证据。",
