    "abstract": "This work concerns controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in networks under communication constraints. We present sample-and-forward, a flexible and communication-efficient version of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for multihop networks with general topologies. Our method evidences that the nodes in a network do not need to communicate p-values to each other to achieve a decent statistical power under the global FDR control constraint. Consider a network with a total of $m$ p-values, our method consists of first sampling the (empirical) CDF of the p-values at each node and then forwarding $\\mathcal{O}(\\log m)$ bits to its neighbors. Under the same assumptions as for the original BH procedure, our method has both the provable finite-sample FDR control as well as competitive empirical detection power, even with a few samples at each node. We provide an asymptotic analysis of power under a mixture model assumption on the p-values.",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文旨在提出一种在通信限制下控制网络中虚警率（FDR）的方法。我们提出了一种灵活且通信高效的样本转发方法，它是Benjamini-Hochberg（BH）程序在具有一般拓扑结构的多跳网络中的版本。我们的方法证明了，为了在全局FDR控制约束下获得良好的统计功率，网络中的节点不需要将p值相互通信。考虑到一个总共有$m$个p值的网络，我们的方法首先对每个节点进行样本抽取，获取p值的经验CDF，然后向其邻居节点转发$\\mathcal{O}(\\log m)$位。在与原始BH程序相同的假设条件下，我们的方法具有可证明的有限样本FDR控制以及竞争性的经验检测功率，即使每个节点只有少量样本数据。我们提供了在p值混合模型假设下的功率渐近分析。",
