This urges the practitioner to develop fair systems with a uniform/comparable performance across sensitive groups. In this work, we investigate the gender bias of deep Face Recognition networks. In order to measure this bias, we introduce two new metrics, $\\mathrm{BFAR}$ and $\\mathrm{BFRR}$, that better reflect the inherent deployment needs of Face Recognition systems. Motivated by geometric considerations, we mitigate gender bias through a new post-processing methodology which transforms the deep embeddings of a pre-trained model to give more representation power to discriminated subgroups.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管深度学习算法在各种日常应用中表现出较高的性能和可靠性，但许多调查显示许多模型存在偏见，歧视特定人群子组（如性别、种族），这促使从业者开发具有一致/可比性能的公平系统。在本研究中，我们研究了深度面部识别网络的性别偏见。为了衡量这种偏见，我们引入了两个新的度量标准，BFAR和BFRR，更好地反映了面部识别系统固有的部署需求。受几何考虑的启发，我们通过一种新的后处理方法来减轻性别偏见，其通过将预训练模型的深度嵌入转换为对受歧视亚组有更多表示能力。它包括训练一个浅层神经网络，通过最小化一个Fa",
