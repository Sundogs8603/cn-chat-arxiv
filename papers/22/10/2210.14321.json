    "abstract": "The popularity of Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) has skyrockted over the past decade, but scientific studies on what exactly triggered ASMR effect remain few and immature, one most commonly acknowledged trigger is that ASMR clips typically provide rich semantic information. With our attention caught by the common acoustic patterns in ASMR audios, we investigate the correlation between the cyclic features of audio signals and their effectiveness in triggering ASMR effects. A cyber-psychological approach that combines signal processing, artificial intelligence, and experimental psychology is taken, with which we are able to quantize ASMR-related acoustic features, and therewith synthesize ASMR clips with random cyclic patterns but not delivering identifiably scenarios to the audience, which were proven to be effective in triggering ASMR effects.",

    "translated_abstract": "自主感官经络反应（ASMR）在过去十年中的受欢迎程度一直在飙升，但关于ASMR效应的准确触发因素的科学研究仍然很少且不成熟，其中一个被广为认可的触发因素是ASMR片段通常提供丰富的语义信息。通过对ASMR音频中常见声学模式的关注，我们研究了音频信号的循环特征与其触发ASMR效应之间的相关性。我们采取了一种结合信号处理、人工智能和实验心理学的网络心理学方法，通过这种方法，我们能够量化与ASMR相关的声学特征，并通过随机循环模式合成ASMR片段，但不向观众提供可识别的情景，这被证明对触发ASMR效应有效。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study presents a cyber-psychological approach that combines signal processing, artificial intelligence, and experimental psychology to analyze the cyclic features of audio signals in ASMR videos. By synthesizing ASMR clips with random cyclic patterns, the research identifies a potential trigger factor for ASMR effects."
