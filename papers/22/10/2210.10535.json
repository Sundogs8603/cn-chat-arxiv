    "abstract": "As interest in graph data has grown in recent years, the computation of various geometric tools has become essential. In some area such as mesh processing, they often rely on the computation of geodesics and shortest paths in discretized manifolds. A recent example of such a tool is the computation of Wasserstein barycenters (WB), a very general notion of barycenters derived from the theory of Optimal Transport, and their entropic-regularized variant. In this paper, we examine how WBs on discretized meshes relate to the geometry of the underlying manifold. We first provide a generic stability result with respect to the input cost matrices. We then apply this result to random geometric graphs on manifolds, whose shortest paths converge to geodesics, hence proving the consistency of WBs computed on discretized shapes.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，由于对图形数据的关注不断增长，计算各种几何工具已变得至关重要。在某些领域，如网格处理，这些工具通常依赖于离散流形中的测地线和最短路径的计算。水印重心(WB)的计算是这种工具的一个最新例子。这是从最优输运理论中导出的一种非常通用的重心概念，以及它们的熵正则化变体。本文研究了在离散网格上的WB与底层流形的几何关系。我们首先提供了一个通用的稳定性结果，关于输入成本矩阵。然后，我们将此结果应用于用于流形的随机几何图形上，它们的最短路径收敛于测地线，从而证明了在离散形状上计算的WB的一致性。",
