A generalized least squares estimator is used to estimate the direction of the optimal separating hyperplane. The estimated hyperplane is shown to interpolate on the training data. While the direction vector can be consistently estimated as could be expected from recent results in linear regression, a naive plug-in estimate fails to consistently estimate the intercept. A simple correction, that requires an independent hold-out sample, renders the procedure minimax optimal in many scenarios. The interpolation property of the latter procedure can be retained, but surprisingly depends on the way the labels are encoded.",
