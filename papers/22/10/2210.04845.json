    "abstract": "This paper is on Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD), where given a few templates (examples) depicting a novel class (not seen during training), the goal is to detect all of its occurrences within a set of images. From a practical perspective, an FSOD system must fulfil the following desiderata: (a) it must be used as is, without requiring any fine-tuning at test time, (b) it must be able to process an arbitrary number of novel objects concurrently while supporting an arbitrary number of examples from each class and (c) it must achieve accuracy comparable to a closed system. Towards satisfying (a)-(c), in this work, we make the following contributions: We introduce, for the first time, a simple, yet powerful, few-shot detection transformer (FS-DETR) based on visual prompting that can address both desiderata (a) and (b). Our system builds upon the DETR framework, extending it based on two key ideas: (1) feed the provided visual templates of the novel classes as visual prompts during test t",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究少样本目标检测（FSOD），即在给定少量未在训练中见过的模板（示例）的情况下，目标是在一组图像中检测出该类别的所有实例。从实际角度考虑，FSOD系统必须满足以下要求：（a）在测试时不需要任何微调，即可以原样使用；（b）能够同时处理任意数量的新类别对象，并支持每个类别的任意数量的示例；（c）能够达到与封闭系统相当的准确性。为了满足（a）-（c），在本文中我们做出了以下贡献：首次引入了一种简单而强大的少样本检测变形器（FS-DETR），基于视觉提示实现了对（a）和（b）的处理。我们的系统基于DETR框架进行扩展，基于两个关键思想：（1）在测试过程中使用提供的新类别视觉模板作为视觉提示。",
