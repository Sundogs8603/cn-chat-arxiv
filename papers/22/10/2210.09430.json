As search engines, recommender systems, and conversational agents are employed across various domains from recreational search to clinical decision support, there is an increasing need for transparent and explainable systems to guarantee accountable, fair, and unbiased results. Despite many recent advances towards explainable AI and IR techniques, there is no consensus on what it means for a system to be explainable. Although a growing body of literature suggests that explainability is comprised of multiple subfactors, virtually all existing approaches treat it as a singular notion.

    "translated_abstract": "信息检索（IR）系统已成为我们日常生活中不可或缺的一部分。由于搜索引擎、推荐系统和对话代理在从娱乐搜索到临床决策支持等各个领域得到应用，因此需要透明和可解释的系统来确保可追溯、公正和无偏见的结果。尽管在可解释的AI和IR技术方面取得了许多近期进展，但仍无法就系统可解释性的含义达成共识。虽然越来越多的文献表明，解释性包含多个子因素，但实际上所有现有方法几乎都将其视为单一概念。在本文中，我们利用心理测量和众包研究了Web搜索系统中的可解释性，以确定人类中心因素与可解释性之间的关系。",
