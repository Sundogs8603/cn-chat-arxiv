    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型在应用中经常出现领域偏移，比如在自动驾驶中的泛化仍然是一个重大挑战。因此，我们提出了一种基于源内样式增强（ISSA）的方法，用于改进语义分割中的领域泛化。我们的方法基于一种新型的StyleGAN2反演掩模噪声编码器。该模型通过噪声预测学习忠实重建图像并保留其语义布局。估计噪声的随机掩蔽使我们的模型具有样式混合能力，即它可以在不影响图像语义布局的情况下改变全局外观。使用所提出的掩模噪声编码器来随机化训练集中的样式和内容组合，ISSA有效地增加了训练数据的多样性并减少了虚假相关性。结果，在不同类型的驾驶场景语义分割中，我们取得了高达12.4％的mIoU改进。",
