    "translated_abstract": "模型为基础的强化学习（MBRL）具有比基于模型的强化学习更高的样本效率。如何从原始感官输入（如图像）自动有效地开发准确的模型，特别是针对复杂的环境和任务，是限制MBRL在现实世界中广泛应用的挑战性问题。本文提出了一种称为SAM-RL的感知感知模型强化学习系统。利用不可导物理仿真和渲染，SAM-RL通过比较渲染图像和真实原始图像自动更新模型并高效产生策略。通过感知感知学习管道，SAM-RL允许机器人选择一个信息丰富的视角来监控任务过程。我们将我们的框架应用于实际的三个操作任务：机器人装配，工具操纵和可变形物体操纵。我们证明了其有效性。",
