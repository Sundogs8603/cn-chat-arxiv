    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了在高斯图模型中将（对角线占优的）M矩阵作为精度矩阵进行估计的问题。这些模型展现了有趣的性质，例如仅使用两个观测值就能获得M矩阵的最大似然估计 \\citep{lauritzen2019maximum,slawski2015estimation}，以及对角线占优的M矩阵仅用一个观测值就能获得最大似然估计 \\citep{truell2021maximum}。我们提出了一种自适应多阶段估计方法，该方法通过在每个阶段解决加权的$\\ell_1$-正则问题来优化估计。此外，我们基于梯度投影法开发了一个统一的框架来解决正则化问题，结合不同的投影来处理M矩阵和对角线占优的M矩阵的约束。提供了对估计误差的理论分析。我们的方法在精度矩阵估计和图边缘识别方面优于现有最先进方法，这一点在合成和金融时间序列数据上得到了证实。",
