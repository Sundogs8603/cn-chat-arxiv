    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习在视觉内容创作方面取得了显著进展。其中包括深度生成的3D感知图像合成，它以3D一致的方式生成高保真度的图像，同时从纯图像集合中捕捉对象的紧凑表面，而无需任何3D监督，从而弥合了2D图像和3D现实之间的差距。计算机视觉领域最近被深度生成3D感知图像合成任务所吸引，过去几年的顶级期刊和会议中涌现出数百篇论文（主要是过去两年），但目前缺乏一份全面的调查报告。我们的综述旨在向新研究者介绍这一主题，为相关工作提供有用的参考，并通过我们的讨论部分激发未来的研究方向。除了展示的论文外，我们还将不断更新最新相关的论文及其相关的研究工作。",
