    "translated_abstract": "您知道吗？超过 7000 万 Dota2 玩家的游戏数据可以公开访问，如果被恶意利用会带来什么问题？本文是第一篇研究这种问题的论文。鉴于视频游戏的普及，我们提出了 Dota2 环境下属性推断攻击（AIA）的第一个威胁模型。我们解释了攻击者如何（以及为什么）可以利用 Dota2 生态系统中丰富的公共数据来推断其玩家的私人信息。由于缺乏关于我们 AIA 效果的具体证据，我们通过对涵盖 26000 场比赛的约 500 名 Dota2 玩家进行广泛调查，验证了它们在现实中的影响力。在发现玩家的 Dota2 活动与其现实生活之间存在联系（$p$ < 0.01 和 $\\rho$ > 0.3）后，我们进行了多种 AIA 的伦理实验，利用机器学习的能力推断出我们调查对象的现实生活属性。",
