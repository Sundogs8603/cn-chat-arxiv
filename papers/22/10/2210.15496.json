    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种车联网边缘联邦学习（VEFL）解决方案，其中边缘服务器利用高度移动的连接车辆（CV）的本地数据集和中央处理单元（CPU）来训练全局模型。收敛分析表明，VEFL训练损失取决于成功接收CV通过间歇性车辆到基础设施（V2I）无线链路传输的训练模型。由于高度移动性，在全设备参与情况（FDPC）下，边缘服务器根据CV数据集大小和逗留时间的加权组合聚合客户端模型参数，而在部分设备参与情况（PDPC）下选择CV的子集。然后，我们设计了在延迟、能量和成本约束条件下的联合VEFL和无线接入技术（RAT）参数优化问题，以最大化成功接收本地训练模型的概率。考虑到优化问题是NP-hard问题，我们将其分解为待解决的子问题。",
