    "translated_abstract": "Yang等人最近通过一种一阶梯度方法解决了具有等式和不等式约束的变分不等式（VI）的问题。但是，提出的原始-对偶方法称为ACVI仅适用于可以计算其子问题的解析解的情况，因此一般情况仍然是一个开放的问题。在本文中，我们采用一种温启动技术，在每次迭代中近似地解决子问题，并使用在先前迭代中找到的近似解初始化变量。我们证明了它的收敛性，并表明当算子为$L$-Lipschitz且单调时，这种不精确的ACVI方法的最后一次迭代的间隙函数下降的速度为$\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{K}})$，前提是错误以适当的速度下降。有趣的是，我们展示了在数值实验中，通常这种技术比其精确对应物收敛更快。此外，对于不等式约束的情况",
