    "translated_abstract": "时间序列异常检测是一个具有挑战性的问题，由于复杂的时间依赖性和有限的标签数据。虽然一些算法，包括传统和深度模型已经被提出，但大多数算法主要集中在时间域建模，没有充分利用时间序列数据中的频域信息。本文提出了一种基于时频分析的时间序列异常检测模型 TFAD，以利用时间和频域进行性能提升。此外，我们还在设计的时频架构中加入了时间序列分解和数据增强机制，进一步提升了性能和解释性能力。广泛使用的基准数据集上的实证研究表明，我们的方法在单变量和多变量时间序列异常检测任务中获得了最先进的性能。代码可在 https://github.com/DAMO-DI-ML/CIKM22-TFAD 获取。",
