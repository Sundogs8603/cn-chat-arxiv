    "translated_abstract": "最优输运提供了一个度量量化概率测度之间差异的方法。对于支撑在离散度量空间上的测度，找到最优输运距离的时间复杂度是与空间大小呈立方关系的。然而，在树上支撑的测度可以通过闭合形式的最优输运来计算，这样的计算复杂度是线性的。在本文中，我们旨在找到一个对于给定的离散度量空间来说具有最优树结构的树-瓦瑟斯坦距离，以逼近原始空间中的最优输运距离。我们的一个关键思想是将问题转化为超度量空间中的问题。这样做有助于我们通过投影梯度下降在超度量矩阵空间上进行优化，这是一个混合离散和连续优化问题。在优化过程中，我们通过层次最小生成树算法将参数投影到超度量空间，相当于对超度量的最接近投影。",
