Compared with existing CQA datasets, PACIFIC exhibits three key features: (i) proactivity, (ii) numerical reasoning, and (iii) hybrid context of tables and text. A new task is defined accordingly to study Proactive Conversational Question Answering (PCQA), which combines clarification question generation and CQA. In addition, we propose a novel method, namely UniPCQA, to adapt a hybrid format of input and output content in PCQA into the Seq2Seq problem, including the reformulation of the numerical reasoning process as code generation. UniPCQA performs multi-task learning over all sub-tasks in PCQA and incorporates a simple ensemble strategy to alleviate the error propagation issue in the multi-task learning by cross-validating top-$k$ sampled Seq2Seq outputs.

    "translated_abstract": "为了促进金融领域混合语境下的对话问答，我们提出了一个名为PACIFIC的新数据集。与现有的对话问答数据集相比，PACIFIC具有三个关键特征：主动性、数字推理和表格和文本的混合语境。我们定义了一个新的任务，即研究主动对话问答系统(PCQA)，它结合了澄清问题生成和对话问答功能。此外，我们提出了一种新方法UniPCQA，将PCQA中输入和输出内容的混合格式适应于Seq2Seq问题，包括将数字推理过程重新定义为代码生成。UniPCQA在PCQA的所有子任务中进行多任务学习，并结合简单的集成策略，通过交叉验证top-k样本中的Seq2Seq输出来减轻多任务学习中的误差传播问题。我们通过广泛的基线测试对PACIFIC数据集进行基准测试，并对每个子任务进行全面评估。",
