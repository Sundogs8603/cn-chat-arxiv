    "abstract": "For many interdisciplinary fields, ML interpretations need to be consistent with what-if scenarios related to the current case, i.e., if one factor changes, how does the model react? Although the attribution methods are supported by the elegant axiomatic systems, they mainly focus on individual inputs, and are generally inconsistent. To support what-if scenarios, we introduce a new notion called truthful interpretation, and apply Fourier analysis of Boolean functions to get rigorous guarantees. Experimental results show that for neighborhoods with various radii, our method achieves 2x - 50x lower interpretation error compared with the other methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于许多跨学科领域，机器学习的解释需要与当前案例相关的假设情景一致，即如果一个因素改变，模型会如何反应？尽管归因方法由优雅的公理系统支持，但它们主要关注单个输入，并且通常不一致。为支持假设情景，我们引入了一个称为真实解释的新概念，并应用布尔函数的傅立叶分析来获得严格的保证。实验结果表明，对于各种半径的邻域，我们的方法与其他方法相比，可以实现2倍至50倍更低的解释误差。",
