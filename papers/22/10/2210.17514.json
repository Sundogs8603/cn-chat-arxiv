    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨在数据收集具有非平凡成本时进行顺序多重假设检验的问题。该问题在识别疾病过程中的差异表达基因等生物实验中出现。本文构建在通用α投资框架上，能在顺序检验环境下进行误发现率控制。我们对α-财富的长期渐进行为进行了理论分析，引出了在α投资决策规则中考虑样本大小的思考。将检验过程视为与自然对抗的博弈，本文构建了一种决策规则，优化α财富的期望回报(ERO)，并为测试提供了最佳样本大小。经验证明，成本感知的ERO决策规则比其他方法正确地拒绝了更多的虚假零假设。本文扩展了成本感知的ERO投资至有限时间检验，使决策规则能够跨越多个检验分配样本。",
