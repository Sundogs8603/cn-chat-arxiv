    "translated_abstract": "重叠社区检测是图挖掘中的一个关键问题。一些研究考虑将图卷积网络（GCN）应用于解决该问题。然而，在一般不规则图的情况下，如何将深度图卷积网络结合起来仍然具有挑战性。在本研究中，我们基于我们的新颖动态扩张聚合机制和统一的端到端编码器-解码器框架，设计了一个深度动态残差图卷积网络（DynaResGCN），用于检测网络中的重叠社区。深度的DynaResGCN模型被用作编码器，而我们将伯努利-泊松（BP）模型作为解码器。因此，我们将我们的重叠社区检测框架应用在一个没有基准值的研究主题数据集，一个拥有可靠（手工标记）基准值的Facebook网络集合，以及一组具有经验性（非手工标记）基准值的非常大的合著网络。",
