    "translated_abstract": "最近数据驱动的学习方法在学习各种不规则地形的鲁棒运动控制器方面表现出色。以轨迹生成器（TG）形式加入良好的运动先验知识，可以有效地学习复杂的运动技能。然而，随着任务/环境变得越来越复杂，在单个良好的TG中定义它仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为它需要大量的调整，同时还有可能降低先验知识的有效性。本文提出一种名为EETG的方法，它使用“质量-多样性（Quality-Diversity）”算法学习一组多样化的专业化运动先验知识，同时在Policies Modulating TG（PMTG）框架内维持单一策略。实验结果表明，EETG使四足机器人能够成功地穿越各种环境，如斜坡、台阶、崎岖地形和平衡横杆。我们的实验结果表明，EETG比使用单个TG的方法更加有效。",
