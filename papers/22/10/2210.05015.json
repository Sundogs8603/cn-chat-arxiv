    "translated_abstract": "部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程(POMDP)提供了现实决策和控制问题的灵活表示。然而，POMDP的求解非常困难，特别是当状态和观测空间是连续或混合的时候，这在物理系统中经常发生。尽管最近使用观测似然权重策划的在线采样POMDP算法表现出了实用的有效性，但先前并没有提出一般理论来刻画这些算法使用的粒子滤波技术的逼近误差。我们的主要贡献是限定任何POMDP与其相应的有限样本粒子信念MDP(PB-MDP)逼近之间的误差。这种PB-MDP和POMDP之间的基础桥梁使得我们能够通过解决相应的粒子信念MDP将任何采样MDP算法适应到POMDP中，从而将MDP算法的收敛保证扩展到POMDP中。在实践中，这可以提高在解决具有大的或连续状态空间的POMDP时的性能和鲁棒性。",
