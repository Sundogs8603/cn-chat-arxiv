    "translated_abstract": "随着预训练语言模型的发展，许多基于提示的方法被提出并在数据有效的知识图谱构建中取得了令人瞩目的表现。然而，现有的基于提示的学习方法仍存在几个潜在的限制：（i）自然语言和预定义模式的输出结构化知识之间的语义差距，这意味着模型无法充分利用受限模板的语义知识；（ii）基于局部个体实例的表示学习限制了性能，给定了不充足的特征，这些特征不能释放预先训练语言模型的潜在类比能力。受这些观察的启发，我们提出了一种检索增强的方法，使用检索得到的架构感知参考作为提示，提高了数据有效的知识图谱构建的语义连贯性和一致性。在两个标准数据集上的实验结果表明，相比现有的基于提示和非提示的方法，我们提出的方法在数据效率和知识质量方面具有优越性。",
