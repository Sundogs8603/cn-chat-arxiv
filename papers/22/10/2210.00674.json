Method: We developed new models using multi-view variational autoencoder (MVAE) for feature representation learning and a product of expert (PoE) model for multi-view information fusion. We applied the proposed models to an in-house Louisiana Osteoporosis Study (LOS) cohort with 931 male subjects, including 345 African Americans and 586 Caucasians. With an analytical solution of the product of Gaussian distribution, we adopted variational inference to train the designed MVAE-PoE model to perform common latent feature extraction. We performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to select 256 genetic variants with the lowest p-values for each proximal femoral strength and integrated whole genome sequence (WGS) features and DXA-derived imaging features to predict proximal femoral strength.

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在设计一个基于深度学习的模型，利用多视角信息融合来预测股骨近端强度。我们采用多视角变分自编码器（MVAE）进行特征表示学习，并使用专家之积（PoE）模型进行多视角信息融合。我们将所提出的模型应用于931名男性受试者组成的路易斯安那骨质疏松症研究（LOS）队列中，包括345名非裔美国人和586名白人。通过高斯分布乘积的解析解，我们采用变分推断来训练设计的MVAE-PoE模型以执行通用潜在特征提取。我们进行了全基因组关联研究（GWAS）来选取每个股骨近端强度的最低p值的256个遗传变异体，并整合了全基因组序列（WGS）特征和DXA成像特征来预测股骨近端强度。",
