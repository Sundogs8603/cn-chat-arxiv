    "abstract": "An increasingly prevalent problem for intelligent technologies is text safety, as uncontrolled systems may generate recommendations to their users that lead to injury or life-threatening consequences. However, the degree of explicitness of a generated statement that can cause physical harm varies. In this paper, we distinguish types of text that can lead to physical harm and establish one particularly underexplored category: covertly unsafe text. Then, we further break down this category with respect to the system's information and discuss solutions to mitigate the generation of text in each of these subcategories. Ultimately, our work defines the problem of covertly unsafe language that causes physical harm and argues that this subtle yet dangerous issue needs to be prioritized by stakeholders and regulators. We highlight mitigation strategies to inspire future researchers to tackle this challenging problem and help improve safety within smart systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "智能技术中一个日益普遍的问题是文本安全性，因为不受控制的系统可能会向用户生成导致伤害或威胁生命的建议。然而，可能导致身体伤害的生成语句的明确程度不同。在本文中，我们区分了可能导致身体伤害的文本类型，并建立了一个尤其未被探索的类别：隐蔽不安全文本。然后，我们进一步分解了这个类别并分析了每个小类别中文本的生成方式。最终，我们的工作定义了导致物理伤害的隐蔽不安全语言问题，并指出这个微妙但危险的问题需要成为相关利益相关者和监管机构的优先考虑问题。我们提出了缓解策略，以启发未来研究人员解决这个具有挑战性的问题，并帮助提高智能系统内部的安全性。",
