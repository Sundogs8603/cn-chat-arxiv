    "abstract": "Intelligent virtual assistants are currently designed to perform tasks or services explicitly mentioned by users, so multiple related domains or tasks need to be performed one by one through a long conversation with many explicit intents. Instead, human assistants are capable of reasoning (multiple) implicit intents based on user utterances via commonsense knowledge, reducing complex interactions and improving practicality. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework of multi-domain dialogue systems, which can automatically infer implicit intents based on user utterances and then perform zero-shot prompting using a large pre-trained language model to trigger suitable single task-oriented bots. The proposed framework is demonstrated effective to realize implicit intents and recommend associated bots in a zero-shot manner.",

    "translated_abstract": "目前的智能虚拟助手只能通过明确提到的任务或服务来执行相关领域或任务，需要通过长时间的会话和多个明确意图来执行。相比之下，人类助手能够基于常识知识推断出用户话语的（多个）隐式意图，从而减少复杂的交互并提高实用性。因此，本文提出了一个多领域对话系统的框架，可以根据用户话语自动推断隐式意图，然后使用大型预训练语言模型进行零-shot提示，从而触发适当的单个任务导向机器人。所提出的框架在零-shot方式下实现了隐式意图和相关机器人的建议的有效性。",
