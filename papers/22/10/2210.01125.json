    "translated_abstract": "基于光子计数探测器（PCD）的光谱计算机断层扫描（CT）吸引了越来越多的关注，因为它能够为生物医学材料提供更准确的识别和定量分析。狭窄能量区间内有限的光子数量导致图像结果的信噪比较低。针对这些挑战，现有的CT重建的监督式深度重建网络很难解决，因为通常无法获取带有清晰结构的无噪声临床图像作为参考。本文提出了一种迭代深度重建网络，将无监督方法和数据先验相结合，命名为Spectral2Spectral。我们的Spectral2Spectral采用无监督的深度训练策略，在端到端的方式中从噪声数据中获得高质量图像。图像-光谱领域内的结构相似性先验被改进为正则化项，进一步约束网络。",
