    "translated_abstract": "时间点过程是建模事件数据的自然工具。在所有的时间点过程模型中，Hawkes过程被证明是最广泛使用的，主要是由于它们对于各种应用的适当建模，特别是在考虑指数或非参数核时。尽管非参数核是一种选择，但这些模型需要大型数据集。而指数核更具数据效率，对于立即触发更多事件的特定应用更有效，但对于需要估计延迟的应用（如神经科学），它们不太适用。本研究旨在提供一种使用具有有限支持的一般参数核进行TPP推理的高效解决方案。所开发的解决方案包括利用事件的离散化的快速$\\ell_2$梯度求解器。在理论上支持离散化的使用后，通过多种实验，证明了该新方法的统计和计算效率。",
