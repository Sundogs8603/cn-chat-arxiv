    "translated_abstract": "本研究聚焦于基于脑电图（EEG）信号的帕金森病（PD）诊断。我们提出了一种启发式大脑功能的新方法，利用EEG信号的动态特征、频率和时间内容提取新的病情特征。我们在一个公开数据集上进行了评估，该数据集包含50个被试中的25个PD患者的EEG信号，这些信号记录了一个3-oddball听觉任务。通过提取两个特征，并使用线性判别分析（LDA）分类器将其分开，我们可以使用单一通道以90％的准确率（$ p <0.03 $）将健康受试者与不健康受试者分开。通过聚合三个通道的信息并进行投票，我们获得了94％的准确性，96％的灵敏度和92％的特异度。评估是使用嵌套Leave-One-Out交叉验证过程进行的，从而避免了数据泄漏问题。",
