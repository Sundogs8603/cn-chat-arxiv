    "translated_abstract": "如果一个图H是一个团图，那么H是一个顶点不交并的团的联合。在2017年，Abu-Khzam引入了(a,d)-集群编辑问题，其中给定一个图G和顶点权重，我们需要决定是否可以通过删除不超过每个顶点v上的d^*(v)条边，并添加不超过每个顶点v上的a^*(v)条边，将G变成一个集群图。之前的研究已经给出了(a,d)-集群编辑问题在P或NP完全性之间的复杂性分界线，唯一未解决的情况是当a=d=1。Abu-Khzam（2017）猜测(1,1)-集群编辑问题是多项式时间可解的。我们通过提供一系列多项式时间约简到度不超过3的C_3和C_4_free图的方法以及设计一个多项式时间算法来解决Abu-Khzam的猜想。",
