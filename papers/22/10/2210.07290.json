This variance comes from two sources of randomness: Data subsampling and Monte Carlo sampling. Whereas existing control variates only address Monte Carlo noise and incremental gradient methods typically only address data subsampling, we propose a new \"dual\" control variate capable of jointly reducing variance from both sources of noise. We confirm that this leads to reduced variance and improved optimization in several real-world applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "黑盒变分推断是一种广泛使用的贝叶斯后验推断框架，但在某些情况下，梯度估计中的高方差会损害准确性和效率。这种方差来自两个随机源：数据子抽样和蒙特卡罗抽样。现有的控制变量仅解决蒙特卡罗噪声，而增量梯度方法通常仅解决数据子抽样，我们提出了一种新的“双”控制变量，能够同时减少两种噪声源的方差。我们确认这导致了减少方差和在多个现实世界应用中提高优化效果。",
