    "translated_abstract": "隐式神经空间表示 (INSR) 已被证明是空间依赖向量场的有效表示方法。本文探讨了使用INSR求解时变偏微分方程。传统的PDE求解器引入了时间和空间离散化。常见的空间离散化包括网格和无网格点云，其中每个自由度对应于空间中的一个位置。虽然这些显式空间对应关系可以直观地建模和理解，但这些表示方法不一定是最优的，对于精度、内存使用和适应性都存在问题。在保持经典的时间离散化不变的情况下（如显式/隐式Euler），我们探讨了INSR作为替代空间离散化的方法，其中空间信息隐含在神经网络权重中。然后通过时间积分，网络权重随时间演化。我们的方法不需要任何现有求解器生成的训练数据，因为我们的方法本身就是求解器。我们在各种基准测试问题上验证了我们的方法，证明了其高精度和稳定性，同时在内存使用方面实现了显著的节省。",
