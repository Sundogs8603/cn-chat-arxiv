    "translated_abstract": "联邦聚类 (FC) 是一个出现在许多实际应用中的无监督学习问题，包括个性化推荐和医疗系统。随着最近确保“被遗忘权”的法律的采纳，机器未学习问题对于FC方法变得非常重要。我们首次介绍了FC的机器未学习问题，并提出了一个定制的安全FC框架的高效未学习机制。我们的FC框架利用了特殊的初始化过程，我们证明对于未学习非常适用。为了保护客户数据隐私，我们开发了安全压缩多集合聚合 (SCMA) 框架，解决了聚类中遇到的稀疏安全联邦学习 (FL) 问题以及更一般的问题。为了同时促进低通信复杂性和秘密共享协议，我们将Reed-Solomon编码与特殊评估点集成到我们的SCMA流水线中。",
