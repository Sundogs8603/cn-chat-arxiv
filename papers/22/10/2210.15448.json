    "translated_abstract": "配对交易是一类交易技术，其策略是基于监测资产对之间的关系。一种常见的配对交易方法是将资产对之间的关系描述为带有高斯噪声的线性空间状态模型。这种表示方法利用卡尔曼滤波器提取具有低复杂性和延迟的金融指标，然后使用经典策略（如Bollinger带）进行处理。然而，这种空间状态模型本质上是近似和不匹配的，经常会降低收益。在本文中，我们提出了KalmenNet辅助的Bollinger带配对交易（KBPT），这是一种借助深度学习的策略，用于增强KF-BB交易的操作。KBPT通过构建一个扩展的空间状态模型来近似配对交易的关系，将其视为持有部分协整。这个空间状态模型被应用于一个交易策略，该策略利用基于卡尔曼滤波的神经网络增强KF-BB交易。",
