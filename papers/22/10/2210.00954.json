    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了课程分配问题，即大学为学生安排课程时间表。目前最先进的机制Course Match存在一个主要缺点：学生在报告他们的偏好时会犯很大的错误，从而对福利和公平性产生负面影响。为解决这一问题，我们引入了一种新机制，即基于机器学习的Course Match（MLCM）。MLCM的核心是一个机器学习驱动的偏好引导模块，通过迭代式地向学生提出个性化的两两比较查询，以减轻学生的报告错误。大量基于真实数据的计算实验表明，MLCM仅需十个比较查询，就能将平均和最小学生效用分别提高7%-11%和17%-29%。最后，我们强调了MLCM对环境变化的稳健性，并展示了我们的设计如何最小化升级至MLCM 的风险。",
