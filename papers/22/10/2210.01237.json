    "translated_abstract": "测量噪声中的统计相关性如何影响高维推断？为了回答这个问题，我们研究了范例性的带尖峰矩阵模型的主成分分析（PCA）问题，在这个问题中，一个秩为一的矩阵被加性噪声污染，从而超越了噪声项独立的假设。我们从低阶多项式正交矩阵集合中抽取噪声，产生的噪声相关性使得该设置对应用领域具有相关性但在理论上具有挑战性。我们首次提供了该模型中推断的贝叶斯最优极限的表征。如果尖峰在旋转下是不变的，则标准谱PCA是最优的。然而，对于更一般的先验，无论是PCA还是现有的近似信息传递算法（AMP）都无法达到信息论极限，我们使用统计力学中的重复方法计算了这一极限。因此，我们提出了一种新的AMP算法，灵感来自自适应Thouless-Anderson-Palmer理论。",
