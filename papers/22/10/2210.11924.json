    "translated_abstract": "随着计算机视觉系统越来越广泛地部署，研究界和公众对这些系统不仅会复制，而且会放大有害社会偏见的担忧日益增加。本文所关注的偏见放大现象是指模型在测试时放大固有的训练集偏见。现有的指标针对单个注释属性（例如，“电脑”）测量偏见放大。然而，几个视觉数据集由具有多个属性注释的图像组成。我们展示了模型可以学习利用多个属性（例如{“电脑”，“键盘”}）的相关性，而这些相关性不被当前的度量所考虑。此外，我们还展示了当前的度量可能会错误地给出最小或没有偏见放大的印象，因为它们涉及对正值和负值进行聚合。此外，这些指标缺乏明确的期望值，使它们变得困难。",
