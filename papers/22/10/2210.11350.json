    "translated_abstract": "通信和计算通常被视为不同的任务。然而，对于许多计算导向的应用程序，主要兴趣是设备本地信息的函数，而不是本地信息本身。在这种情况下，信息论结果表明，利用多路访问信道中的干扰进行计算，即空中计算(OAC)，可以提供显着更高的可实现计算速率，而不是分离通信和计算任务。此外，随着参与节点的增多，空中计算与分离之间的计算速率差距也会增加。鉴于这一动机，本研究提供了关于实用OAC方法的全面调查。在概述与OAC相关的基础知识之后，我们讨论了可用的OAC方案及其优缺点。我们提供了一个实现OAC的方法概述，包括硬件、软件、模型检测和检测的启用机制以及现有平台的调查。最后，我们介绍了OAC方法应用的一些普遍问题。",
