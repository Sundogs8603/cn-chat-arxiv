    "abstract": "Did migrants make Paris a Mecca for the arts and Vienna a beacon of classical music? Or was their rise a pure consequence of local actors? Here, we use data on more than 22,000 historical individuals born between the years 1000 and 2000 to estimate the contribution of famous immigrants, emigrants, and locals to the knowledge specializations of European regions. We find that the probability that a region develops or keeps specialization in an activity (based on the birth of famous physicists, painters, etc.) grows with both, the presence of immigrants with knowledge on that activity and immigrants with knowledge in related activities. In contrast, we do not find robust evidence that the presence of locals with related knowledge explains entries and/or exits. We address some endogeneity concerns using fixed-effects models considering any location-period-activity specific factors (e.g. the presence of a new university attracting scientists).",

    "translated_abstract": "移民是不是让巴黎成为了艺术圣地，维也纳成为了古典音乐的灯塔？还是他们的崛起纯粹是当地人的结果？在这里，我们使用了关于22000多名生于1000年至2000年之间的历史人物的数据，估计了著名移民、移民者和当地人对欧洲地区知识专业化的贡献。我们发现，一个地区在某种活动（基于著名物理学家、画家等的出生）发展或保持专业化的概率随着对该活动具有知识的移民和对相关活动具有知识的移民的存在而增加。相比之下，我们并没有找到有力的证据表明当地人具有相关知识的存在解释了进入和/或退出。我们通过考虑任何特定地点-时期-活动因素（例如吸引科学家的新大学的存在）的固定效应模型来解决一些内生性问题。",
