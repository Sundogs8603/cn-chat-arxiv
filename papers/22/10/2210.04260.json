    "translated_abstract": "Wasserstein分布鲁棒优化（WDRO）是一种通过含糊数据增强机器学习鲁棒性的流行模型。然而，WDRO的复杂度在实践中可能是禁止性的，因为解决其“极小极大”表达式需要大量计算。最近，已经开发了一些针对特定机器学习任务（例如逻辑回归）的快速WDRO训练算法。然而，据我们所知，对于一般的大规模WDRO的设计高效算法的研究仍然非常有限。核心集是一种重要的工具，用于压缩大型数据集，因此已广泛应用于减少许多优化问题的计算复杂性。本文介绍了一种构建一般WDRO问题的$\\epsilon$-coreset的统一框架。尽管由于不确定性而获取WDRO的传统核心集具有挑战性。",
