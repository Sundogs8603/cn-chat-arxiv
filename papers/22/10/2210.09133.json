    "translated_abstract": "本文的主要结果是刻画了在任意波兰空间上的有界连续函数空间$C_b$上的单调泛函的从下方连续性，即在混合拓扑中的下半连续性。在这种特定情况下，混合拓扑与对偶对$(C_b,{\\rm ca})$的Mackey拓扑重合，其中${\\rm ca}$表示具有有限变差的可数可加有限Borel测度的空间。因此，$C_b\\to \\mathbb R$的凸单调映射在混合拓扑中的下半连续性与具有可数可加测度的对偶表示等价。这样的表示在金融学中具有基本重要性，例如在风险度量和超对冲问题的背景中。基于主要结果，研究了$2$-交替容量的容量性质和对偶表示的Choquet积分。在第二步中，本文提供了一个对最大风险测度的具有可数可加测度的对偶表示的表征。",
