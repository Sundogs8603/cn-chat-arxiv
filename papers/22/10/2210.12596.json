    "translated_abstract": "利用单个摄像头测量物体距离是一种经济高效的替代方案，而不需要立体视觉和激光雷达。尽管文献中已经探讨了单目距离估计，但大多数现有技术依赖于物体类别知识以实现高性能。在缺乏这些情境数据的情况下，单目距离估计变得更具挑战性，缺乏参考点和物体特定线索。然而，这些线索可能会误导与范围广泛变化或对抗情况下的对象，这是面向对象不可知距离估计的一个具有挑战性的方面。本文提出了DMODE，一种不需要物体类别知识的单目距离估计类别不可知方法。DMODE通过融合物体随时间变化的大小波动和摄像头运动来估计物体的距离，使其能够适应各种目标检测器和未知物体，从而解决这些挑战。",
