    "translated_abstract": "将知识图谱（KG）进行嵌入以进行多跳逻辑推理是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为许多KG具有庞大而复杂的结构。最近，许多有前途的工作将实体和查询投影到几何空间中以有效地找到答案。但是，建模否定和联合运算符仍然具有挑战性。否定运算符没有严格的边界，这会生成重叠的嵌入并导致获得模糊的答案。另一个限制是并集运算符是非闭合的，这削弱了模型处理一系列并集运算符的能力。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一个新颖的概率嵌入模型，即Gamma Embeddings（GammaE），用于编码实体和查询以回答KG上不同类型的FOL查询。我们利用了Gamma分布的线性特性和强边界支持来捕捉实体和查询的更多特征，从而极大地减少了模型的不确定性。此外，GammaE实现了统一的框架来处理否定和联合运算符。",
