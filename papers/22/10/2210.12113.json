    "translated_abstract": "尽管越来越多的研究开始将深度学习模型应用于医学影像，但医学数据集的稀缺性和不平衡性可能会严重影响这些模型的性能。生成合成数据是一种解决这些问题的常用技术。修补算法是DL生成模型的子集，可以在匹配周围上下文和某些非成像输入条件的同时更改输入图像的一个或多个区域。虽然绝大多数针对医学影像数据的修补技术都使用生成对抗网络（GANs），但由于GAN的有限输出种类，这些算法的性能经常不尽人意。掩模扩散概率模型(DDPMs)是一种最近推出的生成网络系列，能够生成与GANs相当质量的结果，但具有多样化的输出，同时不需要鉴别器。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于DDPM的多任务脑肿瘤修复方法，可以同时修复缺失的脑肿瘤区域并为数据增加合成的脑肿瘤。我们在一个公开可得的脑肿瘤分割数据集上展示了我们提出的方法的有效性，并取得了最先进的性能。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a multitask brain tumor inpainting method based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), which can simultaneously impute missing brain tumor regions and synthesize additional brain tumors for data augmentation. Compared with traditional generative adversarial networks, this method can generate diversified output and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a publicly available dataset."
