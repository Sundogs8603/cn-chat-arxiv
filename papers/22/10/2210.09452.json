    "translated_abstract": "在只有袋级标签可用的情况下，学习单个实例的表示是多实例学习中的一个基本挑战。最近的研究表明，使用对比自我监督学习（CSSL）可以取得有希望的结果，CSSL学习将对应于两个不同随机选择的实例的表示推开。然而，在真实世界的应用中，例如医学图像分类，通常存在类别不平衡，因此随机选择的实例大部分属于同一个多数类别，这使得CSSL无法学习类间差异。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个新的框架，称为迭代自适应有监督对比学习多实例表示（ItS2CLR），通过利用从包级标签派生的实例级伪标签来改善学习到的表示。该框架采用了一种新的自适应有监督对比学习多实例表示的策略来确保伪标签的准确性。我们在三个医学数据集上评估了ItS2CLR。",
