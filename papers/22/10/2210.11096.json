    "translated_abstract": "最近在深度生成模型方面取得的进展已经提高了语音领域中声音转换的质量。然而，对于未知歌手的高质量歌声转换仍然具有挑战性，原因是在音高、音量和发音方面存在更多各种各样的音乐表达。此外，歌声往往是带有混响和伴奏音乐的录音，这使得歌声转换变得更加困难。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种健壮的一次性歌声转换 (ROSVC)，即使在这种失真的歌声上也能稳定地进行任意到任意的歌声转换。为此，我们首先提出了基于生成对抗网络的一次性歌声转换模型，通过部分域条件和学习精确恢复目标音高的音高分布匹配和AdaIN-skip条件，能够泛化到未知歌手。然后，我们提出了一个称为Robustify的两阶段训练方法，该方法在第一阶段使用清洁数据对一次性歌声转换模型进行训练，以确保高质量的转换，并引入增强模块",
