    "translated_abstract": "尽管基于深度神经网络（DNN）的语音增强（SE）方法优于以前的非DNN方法，但它们经常降低所生成输出的感知质量。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种基于DNN的生成细化器，Diffiner，旨在改善通过SE方法预处理过的感知语音质量。我们利用仅包含清晰语音的数据集训练了一个扩散生成模型。然后，我们的细化器有效地将通过去噪扩散恢复新生成的清晰部分与之前的SE方法造成的退化和失真部分混合在一起，从而产生细化的语音。一旦我们的细化器训练为一组清晰的语音，它就可以应用于各种SE方法，而无需为每个SE模块专门进行额外的训练。因此，我们的细化器可以是相对于SE方法的一个多功能的后处理模块，并具有高度的模块化潜力。实验结果表明，我们的方法改善了感知语音质量。",
