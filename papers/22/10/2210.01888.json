    "translated_abstract": "公平性考虑在最近几年中推动了新的聚类问题和算法。本文考虑了优先级拟阵中值问题，它是对最近研究的优先级k-中值问题的一般化。输入包括一组设施$\\mathcal{F}$和一组客户$\\mathcal{C}$，它们位于度量空间$(\\mathcal{F} \\cup \\mathcal{C},d)$中，以及一个拟阵$\\mathcal{M}=(\\mathcal{F},\\mathcal{I})$，表示设施的集合。此外，每个客户$j$都有一个指定的半径$r_j \\ge 0$，每个设施$i \\in \\mathcal{F}$都有一个开放成本$f_i$。目标是选择一组设施的子集$S \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$，使得$\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{F}} f_i + \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{C}} d(j,S)$最小，同时满足两个约束条件：(i) $S$是$\\mathcal{M}$中的独立集（即$S \\in \\mathcal{I}$），(ii) 对于每个客户$j$，它到一个开放设施的距离最多为$r_j$（即$d(j,S) \\le r_j$）。",
