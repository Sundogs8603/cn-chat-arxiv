    "abstract": "Whisper is a recent Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model displaying impressive robustness to both out-of-distribution inputs and random noise. In this work, we show that this robustness does not carry over to adversarial noise. We show that we can degrade Whisper performance dramatically, or even transcribe a target sentence of our choice, by generating very small input perturbations with Signal Noise Ratio of 35-45dB. We also show that by fooling the Whisper language detector we can very easily degrade the performance of multilingual models. These vulnerabilities of a widely popular open-source model have practical security implications and emphasize the need for adversarially robust ASR.",

    "translated_abstract": "Whisper是一种最近的自动语音识别（ASR）模型，对于分布外输入和随机噪声都展示出了令人印象深刻的稳健性。在这项工作中，我们展示了这种稳健性在对抗干扰下并不适用。我们展示了通过生成极小的输入扰动（信噪比为35-45dB），我们可以大幅降低Whisper的性能，甚至转录我们选择的目标句子。我们还展示了通过欺骗Whisper语言检测器，我们可以轻松降低多语言模型的性能。这些对一个广受欢迎的开源模型的脆弱性具有实际的安全影响，并强调了对抗性稳健ASR的需求。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study demonstrates that the robustness of the Whisper model to out-of-distribution inputs and random noise does not extend to adversarial noise. The researchers were able to significantly degrade the performance of the Whisper model and multilingual models by generating small input perturbations, highlighting the practical security implications and the need for adversarially robust ASR."
