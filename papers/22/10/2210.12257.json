    "abstract": "Despite the success of automated machine learning (AutoML), which aims to find the best design, including the architecture of deep networks and hyper-parameters, conventional AutoML methods are computationally expensive and hardly provide insights into the relations of different model design choices. To tackle the challenges, we propose FALCON, an efficient sample-based method to search for the optimal model design. Our key insight is to model the design space of possible model designs as a design graph, where the nodes represent design choices, and the edges denote design similarities. FALCON features 1) a task-agnostic module, which performs message passing on the design graph via a Graph Neural Network (GNN), and 2) a task-specific module, which conducts label propagation of the known model performance information on the design graph. Both modules are combined to predict the design performances in the design space, navigating the search direction. We conduct extensive experiments on",
