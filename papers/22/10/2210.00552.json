    "abstract": "Autonomous navigation in crowded spaces poses a challenge for mobile robots due to the highly dynamic, partially observable environment. Occlusions are highly prevalent in such settings due to a limited sensor field of view and obstructing human agents. Previous work has shown that observed interactive behaviors of human agents can be used to estimate potential obstacles despite occlusions. We propose integrating such social inference techniques into the planning pipeline. We use a variational autoencoder with a specially designed loss function to learn representations that are meaningful for occlusion inference. This work adopts a deep reinforcement learning approach to incorporate the learned representation for occlusion-aware planning. In simulation, our occlusion-aware policy achieves comparable collision avoidance performance to fully observable navigation by estimating agents in occluded spaces. We demonstrate successful policy transfer from simulation to the real-world Turtlebot",

    "translated_abstract": "在拥挤空间中自主导航对于移动机器人来说是一个挑战，因为环境动态不稳定、仅能观察到局部。由于有限的传感器视野和遮挡的人类元素，遮挡在这种情境中普遍存在。先前的研究表明，可以利用观察到的人类互动行为来估计潜在的障碍物，尽管存在遮挡。我们提出将这种社交推断技术集成到规划流程中。我们使用一个特别设计的损失函数的变分自编码器来学习有意义遮挡推断的表示。该工作采用深度强化学习方法，将学习到的表征集成到遮挡感知规划中。在模拟中，我们的遮挡感知政策通过估计被遮挡的区域内的元素，实现了与完全可观察导航相当的碰撞避免性能。我们展示了从模拟到真实Turtlebot上的成功策略迁移。",
