    "translated_abstract": "命名实体识别是自然语言处理中的传统任务。特别是，由于嵌套场景的普遍存在，嵌套实体识别受到广泛关注。最近的研究将目标检测中的集合预测被转移应用于应对实体嵌套，但是这些方法的问题在于需要手动创建查询向量，无法适应上下文中丰富的语义信息。本文提出了一种基于提议器和回归器的端到端实体检测方法来解决这些问题。首先，提议器利用特征金字塔网络生成高质量的实体提议。然后，回归器对提议进行精细调整以生成最终的预测结果。该模型采用了仅编码器架构，因此具有查询语义丰富、实体定位精度高、模型训练容易等优点。此外，我们引入了空间调制变压器来增强模型对不同实体之间内部关系的建模能力。在两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的模型显著优于现有的最先进方法。",

The model adopts an encoder-only architecture with rich query semantics, high precision of entity localization, and easy model training, and introduces a novel spatially modulated transformer to enhance modeling the inner relationship between different entities. Experimental results show that this method outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
