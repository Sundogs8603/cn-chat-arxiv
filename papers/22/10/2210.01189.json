    "translated_abstract": "深度回归模型通常在端到端的方式下学习，没有明确强调回归感知的表示。因此，学习到的表示表现出分散性，无法捕捉样本顺序的连续性，导致广泛的回归任务中产生次优结果。为了填补这个空白，我们提出了Rank-N-Contrast（RNC），一种通过对样本在目标空间中的排名进行比较来学习回归的连续表示的框架。我们从理论和实证上证明了RNC可以保证所学表示的顺序与目标顺序相符，不仅性能更好，而且鲁棒性、效率和泛化能力都得到了显著提高。在计算机视觉、人机交互和医疗保健等领域使用五个真实世界的回归数据集进行的大量实验验证了RNC的最先进性能，突显了其内在的创新贡献。",
