    "translated_abstract": "联邦聚类（FC）是在联邦环境中对集中式聚类的扩展。关键在于如何构建全局相似性度量，而不共享私有数据，因为局部相似性可能不足以正确分组局部数据，而且由于隐私约束，无法直接测量客户端之间的样本相似性。显然，分析FC最直接的方法是采用从集中式方法扩展而来的方法，如K均值（KM）和模糊C均值（FCM）。然而，它们对于客户端之间的非独立同分布（non-IID）数据是脆弱的。为了处理这个问题，我们提出了一种新的联邦聚类框架，称为基于合成数据辅助的联邦聚类（SDA-FC）。它在每个客户端上局部训练生成对抗网络，并将生成的合成数据上传到服务器，在合成数据上执行KM或FCM。合成数据可以使模型免疫于非-IID问题，并使我们能够进行联邦聚类。",
