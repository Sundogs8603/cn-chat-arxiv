    "abstract": "Topology optimization (TO) is a method of deriving an optimal design that satisfies a given load and boundary conditions within a design domain. This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (1) TO and (2) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses \"why\" to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses \"how\" to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined.",

    "translated_abstract": "拓扑优化是一种通过满足一定的荷载和边界条件，推导出最佳设计的方法。这种方法可以在没有初始设计的情况下进行有效的设计，但由于计算成本高而受到限制。与此同时，21世纪的机器学习方法包括深度学习取得了巨大进展，因此许多研究已经进行，以通过将机器学习应用于拓扑优化来实现有效和快速的优化。因此，本研究回顾和分析了先前关于基于机器学习的拓扑优化（MLTO）的研究。使用两个不同的角度对 MLTO 研究进行了回顾，即(1) TO和(2) ML视角。TO的角度解答了为什么要将ML用于TO，而ML的角度则解答了如何将ML应用于TO。此外，还检查了目前MLTO研究的限制和未来研究方向。",
