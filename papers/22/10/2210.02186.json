Previous methods attempt to accomplish this directly from the 1D time series, which is extremely challenging due to the intricate temporal patterns. Based on the observation of multi-periodicity in time series, we ravel out the complex temporal variations into the multiple intraperiod- and interperiod-variations. To tackle the limitations of 1D time series in representation capability, we extend the analysis of temporal variations into the 2D space by transforming the 1D time series into a set of 2D tensors based on multiple periods. This transformation can embed the intraperiod- and interperiod-variations into the columns and rows of the 2D tensors respectively, making the 2D-variations to be easily modeled by 2D kernels.

    "translated_abstract": "时间序列分析在天气预报、异常检测和动作识别等广泛应用中具有巨大重要性。本文关注于时间变化建模，这是广泛分析任务的共同关键问题。以往的方法尝试直接从一维时间序列中完成此任务，但由于复杂的时间模式，这是极具挑战性的。基于对时间序列的多周期性观察，我们将复杂的时间变化分解为多个周期内和周期间的变化。为了解决一维时间序列在表示能力方面的限制，我们将时间变化分析扩展到了二维空间中，将一维时间序列转换成基于多个周期的一组二维张量。这种转换可以将周期内和周期间的变化嵌入到二维张量的列和行中，使得二维变化可以轻松地通过二维卷积核进行建模。",
