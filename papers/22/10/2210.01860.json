    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于多臂赌博机的框架，用于从源数据集S中识别一组紧凑的信息数据实例（即原型），以最好地代表给定的目标集T。给定数据集的原型示例提供了对底层数据分布的可解释性洞察，并在基于实例的推理中起到辅助作用，从而影响人类决策的各个领域。当前最先进的原型选择方法需要在源数据点和目标数据点之间进行O（|S| |T|）的相似性比较，对于大规模设置来说显得难以承受。我们提出通过在原型示例空间中采用随机贪婪搜索和多臂赌博机来减少相似性比较的数量来缓解这个局限性。我们的随机算法ProtoBandit能够在产生O（k^3 |S|）的相似性比较的情况下识别出一组k个原型，这与目标集的大小无关。",
