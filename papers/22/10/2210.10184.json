    "translated_abstract": "预测应用程序性能是性能调整、软硬件协同设计和作业调度等许多任务所依赖的模型之一。我们提出并评估了低秩张量分解来建模应用程序性能。我们使用规则网格对应用程序的输入和配置域进行离散化。在网格单元中映射的应用程序执行时间被平均并表示为张量元素。我们表明，低秩的正交-多项式（CP）张量分解通过对这些张量进行逼近是有效的。我们进一步表明，这种分解使得对一个应用程序参数空间中未观测区域的精确外推成为可能。然后，我们应用张量完成来优化给定一组稀疏的观察的运行时间的CP分解。我们考虑了六个应用的替代分段/网格模型和监督学习模型，并证明使用张量完成功能优化的CP分解具有更高的预测准确性和存储效率。",
