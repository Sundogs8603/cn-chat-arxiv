    "translated_abstract": "近年来，从网络观测数据中估计个体治疗效应引起了人们越来越多的关注。在网络场景中，一个主要挑战是稳定单元治疗价值假设（SUTVA）的违反，该假设认为一个单位的治疗分配不会影响其他人的结果。在网络数据中，由于干扰，一个单位的结果不仅受到其治疗的影响（即直接效应），还受到其他人的治疗影响（即溢出效应）。此外，其他单位的影响始终是异质的（例如，与兴趣相似的朋友对一个人的影响与兴趣不同的朋友不同）。本文针对在异质干扰下估计个体治疗效应（包括直接效应和溢出效应）的问题，我们提出了一种新颖的双加权回归（DWR）算法，通过同时学习捕捉异质干预的注意权重来解决这个问题。",
