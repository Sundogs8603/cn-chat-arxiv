    "translated_abstract": "本研究致力于研究中世纪神秘作家Hadewijch的作品被保存的两份最古老的已知手稿：布鲁塞尔KBR2879-2880（ms.A）和布鲁塞尔KBR 2877-2878（ms.B）。基于编码学和语境论证，我们假定制作B的抄写员使用A作为范本。尽管两个手稿在布局和内容方面的相似之处令人惊叹，但本文旨在确定它们之间的差异。毕竟，无论有意制作一个紧密跟随范本的副本，微妙的语言变化都显而易见。差异涉及拼写惯例，但也涉及单词缩写的方式（以及缩写的程度）。本研究以计算的方式调查了制作mss.A和B的抄写员的拼写配置文件。在本研究的第一部分，我们将更详细地介绍这两个手稿，然后考虑有关抄写员和抄写实践以及Hadewijch作品的先前研究。然后，我们将概述我们的方法并呈现计算分析的结果。最后，我们将讨论我们的发现对中世纪手稿文化和文本传播研究的影响。",
