While many generative models from the computer vision domain, such as variational autoencoders or generative adversarial networks, have been adapted for tabular data generation, less research has been directed towards recent transformer-based large language models (LLMs), which are also generative in nature. To this end, we propose GReaT (Generation of Realistic Tabular data), which exploits an auto-regressive generative LLM to sample synthetic and yet highly realistic tabular data.

    "translated_abstract": "表格数据是最古老和最普遍的数据之一。然而，合成具有原始数据特征的样本仍然是表格数据中的一项重大挑战。虽然计算机视觉领域的许多生成模型，如变分自动编码器或生成对抗网络，已被应用于表格数据生成，但较少的研究方向针对近期的基于转换器的大型语言模型（LLM），它们也具有生成性质。为此，我们提出了GReaT（真实表格数据的生成），它利用自回归生成LLM来采样合成具有高度真实感的表格数据。此外，GReaT可以通过对任意子集特征进行调节来建模表格数据分布；其余特征则无需额外开销进行采样。我们在一系列实验中展示了所提出方法的有效性，可量化所产生数据的有效性和质量。",
