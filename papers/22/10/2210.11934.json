    "abstract": "We study hybrid search in text retrieval where lexical and semantic search are fused together with the intuition that the two are complementary in how they model relevance. In particular, we examine fusion by a convex combination (CC) of lexical and semantic scores, as well as the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) method, and identify their advantages and potential pitfalls. Contrary to existing studies, we find RRF to be sensitive to its parameters; that the learning of a CC fusion is generally agnostic to the choice of score normalization; that CC outperforms RRF in in-domain and out-of-domain settings; and finally, that CC is sample efficient, requiring only a small set of training examples to tune its only parameter to a target domain.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究文本检索中混合搜索的方法，将词汇和语义搜索融合在一起，因为它们对于模型相关性的建模具有互补性。特别地，我们研究了通过词汇和语义评分的凸组合（CC）进行融合，以及互惠排名融合（RRF）方法，并确定它们的优点和潜在缺陷。与现有研究相反，我们发现RRF对其参数很敏感；CC融合的学习通常不关心评分规范的选择；CC在域内和域外设置中优于RRF；最后，CC具有样本效率，只需要少量训练示例即可调整其唯一参数以适应目标领域。",
