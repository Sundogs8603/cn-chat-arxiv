    "translated_abstract": "胸部成像在诊断和预测 COVID-19 患者呼吸状况恶化方面起着重要作用。已经开发出许多基于深度学习的肺炎识别方法来实现计算机辅助诊断。然而，长时间的训练和推断使它们缺乏灵活性，而缺乏可解释性降低了它们在临床医学实践中的可信度。本文旨在开发一个具有可解释性的肺炎识别框架，可以理解胸部 X 射线（CXR）图像中肺部特征与相关疾病之间的复杂关系，为医学实践提供高速分析支持。为了减少计算复杂性以加速识别过程，提出了一种新颖的基于 Transformer 的多级自注意机制来加速收敛并强调与任务相关的特征区域。此外，采用了实用的 CXR 图像数据增强技术来解决数据稀缺问题。",
