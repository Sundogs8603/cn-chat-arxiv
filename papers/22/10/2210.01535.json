But which skills are a good investment for workers and firms? As skills are seldomly applied in isolation, we propose that complementarity strongly determines a skill's economic value. For 962 skills, we demonstrate that their value is strongly determined by complementarity - that is, how many different skills, ideally of high value, a competency can be combined with. We show that the value of a skill is relative, as it depends on the skill background of the worker. For most skills, their value is highest when used in combination with skills of a different type. We put our model to the test with a set of skills related to Artificial Intelligence (AI). We find that AI skills are particularly valuable - increasing worker wages by 21% on average - because of their strong complementarities and their rising demand in recent years.

    "translated_abstract": "全球劳动力被敦促不断提升自己的技能，因为技术变革偏好某些新技能，同时使其他技能变得多余。但是对于工人和公司来说，哪些技能是一个好的投资呢？由于技能很少是孤立应用的，我们提出互补性强烈决定了技能的经济价值。我们对962种技能进行了研究，证明了它们的价值在很大程度上由互补性决定-即一个能力可以与多少不同的技能理想情况下结合，这些技能具有很高的价值。我们显示，技能的价值是相对的，因为它取决于工人的技能背景。对于大多数技能来说，当与不同类型的技能组合使用时，它们的价值最高。我们用与人工智能（AI）相关的技能集对我们的模型进行了测试。我们发现，人工智能技能尤其有价值-平均提高工人工资21％-这是因为它们的互补性强大，并且近年来需求不断增加。模型和指标",
