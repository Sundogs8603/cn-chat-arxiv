    "translated_title": "开发者如何讨论Pandas主题的实证研究",
    "translated_abstract": "Pandas是Python编程语言中用于数据分析的软件库。由于Pandas是一种快速、易于使用且开源的数据分析工具，因此它在软件工程项目（如软件开发、机器学习、计算机视觉、自然语言处理、机器人技术等）中被广泛使用。因此，软件开发者对Pandas表现出了巨大的兴趣，并且现在在线开发者论坛（如Stack Overflow）中的讨论数量也越来越多。这些讨论可以帮助了解Pandas库的受欢迎程度，也可以帮助了解Pandas主题的重要性、普及率和困难程度。本研究的主要目的是找到Pandas主题的受欢迎程度和困难程度。为此，我们收集了与Pandas主题讨论相关的Stack Overflow帖子，对帖子的文本内容进行了主题建模。我们发现了26个主题，进一步将其分类为5个广泛的类别。结果显示，最受欢迎的主题是与数据操作、数据分析和数据可视化相关的主题，而最困难的主题与数据清洗和数据挖掘相关。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过收集Stack Overflow中与Pandas主题讨论相关的帖子，进行主题建模，发现了Pandas数据操作、数据分析和数据可视化等主题非常受欢迎，而数据清洗和数据挖掘等主题相对较难。",
    "en_tdlr": "This empirical study collects posts related to Pandas topic discussions from Stack Overflow, conducts topic modeling and finds that Pandas topics related to data manipulation, data analysis and data visualization are very popular while topics related to data cleaning and data mining are relatively difficult."
