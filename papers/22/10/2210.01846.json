    "translated_abstract": "全球食品生产网络中的依赖关系可能导致多个地区的短缺，这在俄乌冲突对全球粮食供应的影响中得到了证实。本文使用一个多层次的贸易(直接)和食品产品转化(间接)的网络模型，揭示了在192个国家和地区的农业生产发生局部冲击后125种食品产品的损失情况，从而量化了1亿次 冲击传播。我们发现，在乌克兰出现完全农业生产损失的情况下，对其他国家造成的影响是异质的，通过直接效应，导致葵花籽油和玉米相对损失高达89%和85%，通过间接影响，家禽肉类的损失高达25%。尽管先前的研究通常将食品产品孤立地处理，并没有考虑生产过程中的产品转化，但我们的模型研究了当地供应冲击的全球传播，沿着生产和贸易关系进行比较。",
