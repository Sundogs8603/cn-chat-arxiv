While existing studies in behavioral finance have discovered various aspects of human sub-rationality, there lacks a comprehensive framework to transfer these findings into an adaptive human model applicable across diverse financial market scenarios. In this study, we introduce a flexible model that incorporates five different aspects of human sub-rationality using reinforcement learning. Our model is trained using a high-fidelity multi-agent market simulator, which overcomes limitations associated with the scarcity of labeled data of individual investors. We evaluate the behavior of sub-rational human investors using hand-crafted market scenarios and SHAP value analysis, showing that our model accurately reproduces the observations in the previous stud",

    "translated_abstract": "在现实生活中，人类的决策与完全理性个体做出的最佳决策存在明显差异，主要是由于计算限制或心理偏见。尽管行为金融领域的现有研究发现了人类次理性的各个方面，但缺乏将这些发现转化为适用于不同金融市场场景的自适应人类模型的综合框架。在本研究中，我们引入了一个灵活的模型，利用强化学习结合五个不同方面的人类次理性。我们的模型使用高保真度的多智能体市场模拟器进行训练，克服了缺乏个体投资者标记数据的限制。我们通过手工制作的市场场景和SHAP值分析评估了次理性人类投资者的行为，显示出我们的模型准确地重现了先前研究中的观察结果。",
