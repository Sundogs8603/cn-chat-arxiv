    "translated_abstract": "压力在日常生活的许多方面都很普遍，包括工作、医疗和社交互动。许多研究已经研究了各种生物信号的手工特征，这些特征是压力的指标。最近，也提出了使用深度学习模型检测压力。通常，压力模型在相同的数据集上进行训练和验证，通常涉及一个压力场景。然而，为每个场景收集压力数据是不实际的。因此，研究这些模型的泛化能力，并确定它们在其他场景中的使用程度非常重要。在本文中，我们探索了基于心电图(ECG)的深度学习模型和基于心电图特征（即心率变异性(HRV)特征）的模型的泛化能力。为此，我们训练了三个HRV模型和两个使用ECG信号作为输入的深度学习模型。我们使用了两个流行的压力数据集（WESAD和SWELL-KW）的ECG信号。",
