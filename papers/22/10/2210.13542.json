    "abstract": "Differentiable planning promises end-to-end differentiability and adaptivity. However, an issue prevents it from scaling up to larger-scale problems: they need to differentiate through forward iteration layers to compute gradients, which couples forward computation and backpropagation, and needs to balance forward planner performance and computational cost of the backward pass. To alleviate this issue, we propose to differentiate through the Bellman fixed-point equation to decouple forward and backward passes for Value Iteration Network and its variants, which enables constant backward cost (in planning horizon) and flexible forward budget and helps scale up to large tasks. We study the convergence stability, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed implicit version of VIN and its variants and demonstrate their superiorities on a range of planning tasks: 2D navigation, visual navigation, and 2-DOF manipulation in configuration space and workspace.",

    "translated_abstract": "可微规划承诺具有端到端的可微性和适应性。然而，一个问题阻止了它在更大规模的问题上的扩展：需要通过向前迭代层进行微分以计算梯度，这会将前向计算和反向传播耦合起来，并需要平衡前向规划器的性能和反向传递的计算成本。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了通过 Bellman 固定点方程进行微分以将值迭代网络及其变体的前向和后向传递解耦的方法，这使得反向传播成本（在规划视程内）保持不变，同时前向预算更加灵活，有助于扩展到更大的问题上。我们研究了所提出的 VIN 隐式版本及其变体的收敛稳定性、可扩展性和效率，并在一系列规划任务上展示了它们的优越性：2D 导航、视觉导航以及构型空间和工作空间中的 2-DOF 操作。",
