    "abstract": "The ability to generalise well is one of the primary desiderata of natural language processing (NLP). Yet, what 'good generalisation' entails and how it should be evaluated is not well understood, nor are there any evaluation standards for generalisation. In this paper, we lay the groundwork to address both of these issues. We present a taxonomy for characterising and understanding generalisation research in NLP. Our taxonomy is based on an extensive literature review of generalisation research, and contains five axes along which studies can differ: their main motivation, the type of generalisation they investigate, the type of data shift they consider, the source of this data shift, and the locus of the shift within the modelling pipeline. We use our taxonomy to classify over 400 papers that test generalisation, for a total of more than 600 individual experiments. Considering the results of this review, we present an in-depth analysis that maps out the current state of generalisation ",

    "translated_abstract": "良好的泛化能力是自然语言处理(NLP)的主要目标之一。然而，对于什么是“良好的泛化”以及如何评估它仍不明确，也没有泛化的评估标准。在本文中，我们为解决这两个问题奠定了基础。我们提出了一个用于表征和理解NLP中泛化研究的分类法。该分类法基于对泛化研究的广泛文献综述，包含了五个不同的维度：主要动机、研究的泛化类型、考虑的数据转移类型、数据转移的来源以及转移在建模流程中的位置。我们使用这个分类法对测试泛化的400多篇论文进行了分类，共进行了600多个实验。通过综述的结果，我们提供了一份深入分析，揭示了当前泛化研究的现状。",
