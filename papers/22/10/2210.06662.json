    "translated_abstract": "从时间边缘的快照中学习系统的连续动力学是自然科学和机器学习中出现的问题，包括量子系统、单细胞生物数据和生成建模。在这些设置中，我们假设只能访问在时间上不相关的横截面样本，而不是完整的样本轨迹。为了更好地理解观察的系统，我们希望学习一个模型，使我们能够在时间上传播样本，从而模拟整个个体轨迹。在本文中，我们提出了动作匹配方法，使用仅来自其时间演化的独立样本来学习丰富的动力学家族。我们推导出一个容易处理的训练目标，它不依赖于关于底层动力学的显式假设，也不需要通过微分方程或最优传输解算器进行反向传播。受到最优传输和生成对抗网络的启发，我们的方法学习一种损失函数，它衡量一系列动作将系统从一个时间点驱动到下一个时间点的可能性。我们在一系列动力学系统上展示了我们的方法的优越性，包括随机微分方程和量子电路。",

    "en_tdlr": "Action Matching is a method proposed in this paper that learns dynamics from snapshots of marginal data, without requiring full trajectories. It learns a cost function to propagate samples and simulate individual trajectories, and is demonstrated on systems including stochastic differential equations and quantum circuits."
