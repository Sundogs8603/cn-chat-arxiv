    "translated_abstract": "供应链管理(SCM)被认为是一个与许多行业有关的重要学科，在这个学科中，涉及下游零售商和上游供应商的两层随机库存模型对于制定公司的供应链管理策略起着基本作用。本文旨在设计针对具有未知需求分布的这一问题的在线学习算法，与经典的在线优化问题相比，这带来了不同的特点。具体而言，我们考虑了[Cachon和Zipkin,1999]引入的两层供应链模型在两种不同的设置下：集中式设置，其中一个计划者同时决定两个代理的策略，以及分散式设置，其中两个代理独立自私地决定其策略。我们设计了算法，在两种设置下都实现了对遗憾和收敛到最优库存决策的有利保证，同时还针对分散式设置下的个人遗憾提供保证。",
