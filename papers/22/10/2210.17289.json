    "translated_abstract": "大型多代理系统通常由局部定义的代理交互驱动，即自组织。本文的首要目标是确定这种局部交互扩散到特定感兴趣代理的时间。虽然可以使用重建所有代理状态的传统方法，但可能会带来不必要的计算成本。我们研究了一种CNN-LSTM模型，可以在不重建的情况下预测大型自组织多代理系统中特定代理的状态。所提出的模型包括CNN编码器以低维度向量表示系统，LSTM模块学习向量空间中的代理动态，并预测未来代理状态的MLP解码器。我们以森林火灾模型为例，旨在预测特定树代理何时开始燃烧。我们将所提出的模型与重建型方法（如CNN-LSTM和ConvLSTM）进行比较。所提出的模型表现出更好的性能，可以预测局部代理的行为而无需重建所有代理状态，从而实现更高效和可扩展的自组织众智系统应用。",
