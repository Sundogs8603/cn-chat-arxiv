    "translated_abstract": "最近，利用辅助知识图谱的知识增强方法在关系抽取方面已经超越了传统的基于文本的方法。但据我们所知，目前还没有包含证据句子和知识图谱的公共数据集可用于知识增强关系抽取。为了弥补这一空白，我们介绍了知识增强关系抽取数据集（KERED）。KERED为每个句子注释一个关系事实，并通过实体链接提供实体的知识背景。利用我们策划的数据集，我们在两种普遍的任务设置下比较了当代关系抽取方法：句子级和包级。实验结果表明，KERED提供的知识图谱可以支持知识增强的关系抽取方法。我们相信，KERED为评估知识增强关系抽取性能提供了高质量的关系抽取数据集和相应的知识图谱。",
