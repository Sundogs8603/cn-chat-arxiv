    "translated_abstract": "解决博弈论中的Nash Equilibria、Correlated Equilibria和Coarse Correlated Equilibria等解决方案对于许多多智能体机器学习算法非常有用。然而，解决正则形式的博弈可能需要禁止或非确定性时间收敛，并且可能会失败。我们介绍了神经平衡求解器，它利用一种特殊的等变神经网络结构来近似解决所有固定形状的游戏空间，从而提高速度和确定性。我们定义了一个灵活的平衡选择框架，能够唯一选择最小化相对熵或最大化福利的平衡。网络可以在不需要生成任何监督训练数据的情况下进行训练。我们展示了惊人的零-shot泛化能力，使网络适用于更大的游戏。我们认为这样的网络是许多可能多智能体算法的强大组件。",
