    "abstract": "Many recent loss functions in deep metric learning are expressed with logarithmic and exponential forms, and they involve margin and scale as essential hyper-parameters. Since each data class has an intrinsic characteristic, several previous works have tried to learn embedding space close to the real distribution by introducing adaptive margins. However, there was no work on adaptive scales at all. We argue that both margin and scale should be adaptively adjustable during the training. In this paper, we propose a method called Adaptive Margin and Scale (AdaMS), where hyper-parameters of margin and scale are replaced with learnable parameters of adaptive margins and adaptive scales for each class. Our method is evaluated on Wall Street Journal dataset, and we achieve outperforming results for word discrimination tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度度量学习中的许多损失函数采用对数和指数形式，需要使用边界和尺度等超参数。由于每个数据类都具有固有特征，因此先前的一些工作尝试通过引入自适应边界来学习接近真实分布的嵌入空间。然而，先前没有关于自适应尺度的研究。本文认为在训练过程中应该自适应地调整边界和尺度。我们提出了一种称为AdaMS的方法，其中边界和尺度的超参数被替换为每个类的自适应边界和自适应尺度的可学习参数。我们在华尔街日报数据集上评估了我们的方法，并在单词识别任务上取得了表现更好的结果。",
