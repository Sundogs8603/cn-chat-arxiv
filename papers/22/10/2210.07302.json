    "translated_abstract": "支付通道网络（PCNs）是一种层2的区块链可扩展性解决方案，其主要实体是支付通道，通过在链外进行交易，减轻了链上网络的负担。具有多个通道的节点可以通过提供流动性和留存部分支付金额作为费用来作为多跳支付的中继。中继节点可能会出现一个或多个不平衡的通道，因此需要触发再平衡操作。本文研究了中继节点如何通过使用潜水艇交换的再平衡方法来最大化其费用收益。我们引入了一个随机模型来捕捉中继节点观察到的随机交易到达和定期进行再平衡操作的动态，并将系统演化表示为马尔可夫决策过程。我们对所有再平衡策略的节点财富随时间的最大化问题进行了数学建模，并近似求解了最优解。",
