    "translated_abstract": "在许多安全关键的应用中，可靠地估计模型生命周期内的预测不确定性至关重要。最常用的衡量方法是通过预测置信度来衡量。虽然这种方法在领域内样本中表现良好，但在领域漂移时这些估计是不可靠的，并且仅限于分类。相反，对于大多数预测任务，可以使用适当的得分，但是当前文献中不存在用于模型不确定性的偏差-方差分解方法。在这项工作中，我们引入了适用于适当得分的通用偏差-方差分解方法，由此引出Bregman信息作为方差项。我们发现指数族和分类对数似然是特殊情况，并提供了新的公式。令人惊讶的是，我们可以纯粹地在logit空间中表示分类情况。我们展示了这种分解方法在多个下游任务中的实际相关性，包括模型集成和置信区间。",
