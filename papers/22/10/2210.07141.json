    "abstract": "Multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) is the problem of finding collision-free paths for a set of robots in a continuous state space. The difficulty of MRMP increases with the number of robots and is exacerbated in environments with narrow passages that robots must pass through, like warehouse aisles where coordination between robots is required. In single-robot settings, topology-guided motion planning methods have shown improved performance in these constricted environments. In this work, we extend an existing topology-guided single-robot motion planning method to the multi-robot domain to leverage the improved efficiency provided by topological guidance. We demonstrate our method's ability to efficiently plan paths in complex environments with many narrow passages, scaling to robot teams of size up to 25 times larger than existing methods in this class of problems. By leveraging knowledge of the topology of the environment, we also find higher-quality solutions than other methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "多机器人运动规划(MRMP)的问题在于为一组机器人在连续状态空间中找到无冲突的路径。当机器人数量增加并且在具有狭窄通道而机器人必须通过的环境中，例如需要机器人之间协调的仓库通道时，MRMP的难度会增加。在单机器人情况下，拓扑引导的运动规划方法已显示出在这些受限环境中提高了性能。在本研究中，我们将现有的拓扑引导单机器人运动规划方法扩展到多机器人领域，利用拓扑引导提供的改善效率。我们演示了我们的方法在具有许多狭窄通道的复杂环境中有效地规划路径，规模可以扩展到比现有在此类问题中的方法大25倍的机器人团队。通过利用环境的拓扑知识，我们也找到了比其他方法更高质量的解决方案。",
