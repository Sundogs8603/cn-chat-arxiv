    "translated_abstract": "时间序列预测已成为一项关键任务，因为它在实际应用中具有高实用性，如交通、能源消耗、经济和金融、疾病分析等。最近的基于深度学习的方法在时间序列预测方面取得了显着的成功。然而，由于时间序列数据的动态性，深度网络仍然面临不稳定的训练和过度拟合问题。在实际数据中出现的不一致模式导致模型对特定模式存在偏差，从而限制了泛化性能。在本文中，我们引入了训练损失的动态误差界限，以解决时间序列预测中的过度拟合问题。因此，我们提出了一种名为WaveBound的正则化方法，该方法估计每个时间步长和每个特征的训练损失的适当误差界限。通过使模型专注于不可预测的数据较少，WaveBound稳定了训练过程，从而显着提高了泛化能力。",
