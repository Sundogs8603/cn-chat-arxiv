    "translated_abstract": "近期大规模语言模型在从高层次文本查询中生成机器人代理的动作计划方面表现出了很好的潜力。然而，这些模型通常不考虑机器人的环境，导致生成的计划可能无法执行，因为计划中的动作模糊不清或受到环境限制。本文提出了一种生成带环境感知的可执行动作计划的方法。我们的方法是将环境对象和对象关系作为额外输入集成到LLM动作计划生成中，以提供系统对周围环境的感知，从而生成与场景中存在的物体相对应的计划动作。此外，我们设计了一种新颖的评分函数，帮助系统消除物体实例之间的歧义并考虑它们的状态。我们在一个机器人操作任务上评估了我们的方法，并展示了我们的模型相对于传统的LLM方法生成了更高成功率的可执行计划。",
