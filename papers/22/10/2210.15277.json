Here, we show that such graphs can be reproduced using an infinite-dimensional inner product model, where the node representations lie on a low-dimensional manifold. Recovering a global representation of the manifold is impossible in a sparse regime. However, we can zoom in on local neighbourhoods, where a lower-dimensional representation is possible. As our constructions allow the points to be uniformly distributed on the manifold, we find evidence against the common perception that triangles imply community structure.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，在包含许多三角形的稀疏图中，无法使用节点的有限维度表示来重现，其中连结概率是内积。在这里，我们展示了这样的图可以使用无限维度的内积模型来复现，其中节点表示位于低维流形上。在稀疏的情况下，恢复流形的全局表示是不可能的。然而，我们可以缩小到本地邻域，在那里较低维度的表示是可能的。由于我们的构造允许点均匀分布在流形上，因此我们发现了反对通常的看法——三角形意味着社区结构。",
