    "translated_abstract": "交通速度是表征道路网络流动性的核心因素，许多交通应用程序都依赖于它，如实时导航、动态路线规划和拥堵管理。传感和通信技术的快速进展使交通速度检测比以往任何时候都更加容易。然而，由于静态传感器的稀疏部署或移动传感器的低渗透，检测到的速度是不完整的，并且远离全网使用。此外，由于各种原因传感器容易出现误差或缺失数据，这些传感器检测到的速度会变得非常嘈杂。因此，需要有效的技术从不完整的数据中恢复可信的估计值。在本研究中，我们首先将问题确定为一个时空克里金问题，并提出了一种拉普拉斯增强的低秩张量完成（LETC）框架，其具有低秩性和多维相关性，用于在有限观测下进行大规模交通速度克里金。",
