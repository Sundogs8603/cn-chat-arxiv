    "translated_abstract": "分子动力学（MD）模拟技术广泛应用于各种自然科学应用中。机器学习（ML）力场（FF）模型越来越多地开始取代从原子结构直接预测力的从头算法模拟。尽管在这个领域取得了重要进展，但这些技术主要通过力/能预测误差进行基准测试，尽管实际使用情况是产生逼真的MD轨迹。我们旨在通过引入新的学习MD模拟基准套件来填补这一空白。我们策划了代表性的MD系统，包括水，有机分子，肽和材料，并设计与各个系统的科学目标相对应的评估指标。我们对一系列最新的ML FF模型进行基准测试，并阐明了通常被基准测试的力精度与相关模拟指标不一致的情况。我们演示了选择的SOTA方法何时以及如何失败，",
