    "translated_abstract": "从观测数据中进行因果推断需要不可测试的识别假设。如果这些假设适用，机器学习（ML）方法可用于研究复杂形式的因果效应异质性。最近，已经开发了几种ML方法来估计条件平均处理效应（CATE）。如果手头的特征无法解释所有的异质性，个体处理效应（ITE）可能严重偏离CATE。在这项工作中，我们展示了当应用因果随机森林（CRF）时，ITE和CATE的分布可能不同。我们扩展了CRF以估计接受组和对照组之间的条件方差差异。如果ITE分布等于CATE分布，则估计的方差差异应该很小。如果它们不同，需要额外的因果假设来量化CATE分布所没有捕捉到的异质性。当个体效应部分和CATE部分的条件方差是可识别的。",

By introducing a causal random forest to estimate the difference in conditional variance between the treated and control groups, it is discovered that if the distribution of individual effects equals the distribution of the average effect, the estimated variance difference is small, otherwise an additional causal assumption is necessary to quantify the unexplained heterogeneity."
