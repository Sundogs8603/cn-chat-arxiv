    "translated_abstract": "脸部图像是一个丰富的信息源，可以用来识别个人并推断他们的私人信息。为了减轻这种隐私风险，匿名化方法使用对清晰图像进行转换以混淆敏感信息，同时保留一定的实用性。然而，虽然它们以令人印象深刻的声明发表，但有时并未经过令人信服的方法评估。将匿名化图像逆转回仿真其真实输入的程度，甚至能被人脸识别方法识别，这对于匿名化的缺陷是最强有力的指标。最近的一些研究结果的确表明，对于某些方法而言这是可能的。然而，目前对于哪些方法是可逆的，以及为什么可逆还不太清楚。在本文中，我们对脸部匿名逆转现象进行了全面的研究。我们发现，在经过测试的15种方法中，有11种至少部分可逆，并重点介绍了重构和反演是如何实现可逆性的。",
