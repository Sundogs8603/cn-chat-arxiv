    "abstract": "We study reserve prices in auctions with independent private values when bidders are expectations-based loss averse. We find that the optimal public reserve price excludes fewer bidder types than under risk neutrality. Moreover, we show that public reserve prices are not optimal as the seller can earn a higher revenue with mechanisms that better leverage the ``attachment effect''. We discuss two such mechanisms: i) an auction with a secrete and random reserve price, and ii) a two-stage mechanism where an auction with a public reserve price is followed by a negotiation if the reserve price is not met. Both of these mechanisms expose more bidders to the attachment effect, thereby increasing bids and ultimately revenue.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了独立私有价值拍卖中，竞标者基于期望的损失厌恶时的保留价格。我们发现最优的公共保留价格排除的竞标者类型比风险中性情况下少。此外，我们表明公共保留价格并不是最优的，卖家可以通过更好地利用“依恋效应”的机制来获得更高的收益。我们讨论了两种这样的机制：i)具有秘密和随机保留价格的拍卖，和ii）如果未能达到保留价格，则后续进行协商的两阶段机制。这些机制都使更多的竞标者暴露于依恋效应之下，从而增加投标并最终增加收益。",
