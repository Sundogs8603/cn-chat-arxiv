    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了一个优化消费投资问题，其中未观察到的股票趋势受到表示不同经济环境的隐藏马尔可夫链的调制。在传统方法中，隐藏状态是通过历史资产价格进行估计的，但是最近技术的进步使得投资者能够考虑替代数据来做决策。这些替代数据包括社交媒体评论、专家意见、COVID-19疫情数据和GPS数据，它们来自于市场数据的标准来源之外，但被认为对预测股票趋势有用。我们为这个问题发展了一个新的对偶理论，并考虑了替代数据系列的跳跃扩散过程。这个理论通过提供适用于滤波方程的条件，从而允许基于动态规划原理的控制方法用于帮助投资者识别“有用”的替代数据，实现动态决策。我们演示了一个应用来证明一个唯一的sm",
