This study extends Maestro, a speech-text joint pretraining framework for automatic speech recognition (ASR), to speech generation tasks. To train a TTS model from various types of speech and text data, different training schemes are designed to handle supervised (paired TTS and ASR data) and unsupervised (untranscribed speech and unspoken text) datasets.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出Virtuoso，这是一个用于文本到语音合成（TTS）模型的大规模多语言语音文字联合半监督学习框架。现有的多语言TTS通常支持几十种语言，这只是全球数千种语言的一小部分。将多语言TTS扩展到数百种语言的一个困难是，在低资源语言中收集高质量的语音-文本配对数据。本研究将Maestro（一种面向自动语音识别（ASR）的语音-文本联合预训练框架）扩展到语音生成任务。为了从不同类型的语音和文本数据中训练TTS模型，设计了不同的训练方案，以处理有监督的（配对的TTS和ASR数据）和无监督的（未转录的语音和未发声的文本）数据集。实验评估表明，1）在已知语言中，使用Virtuoso训练的多语言TTS模型可以比基线模型显着提高自然度和可懂度；2）在看不到参考语音样本或转录文本的情况下，它们可以合成未知语言的语音。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a massively multilingual speech-text joint semi-supervised learning framework called Virtuoso for text-to-speech synthesis. Virtuoso can train TTS models in both supervised and unsupervised datasets, achieving significantly better naturalness and intelligibility than baseline models, and synthesizing speech in unseen languages without reference samples or text."
