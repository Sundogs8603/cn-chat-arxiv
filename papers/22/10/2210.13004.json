    "translated_abstract": "在神经信息处理的复杂领域中，从次要细节中辨别出基本原理仍然是一个重大挑战。尽管我们已经对早期视觉系统的解剖学和生理学有了广泛的了解，但一个全面的计算理论仍然难以捉摸。我们能否通过抽象出系统的详细实现并专注于系统旨在解决的基本问题，来洞察生物系统的基本原理呢？利用基于最简化而又现实的假设的一个抽象模型，我们展示了如何实现早期视觉系统的两个最终目标：高效的信息传输和传感器概率分布建模。我们表明，为了优化信息传输，并不意味着获得了最优的概率分布建模。我们通过使用一个二维系统和图像块来说明，可以通过由两个类型驱动的非线性种群码实现一个高效的表示。",
