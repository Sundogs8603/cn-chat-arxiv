    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了逐步观测的概率模型，其中有限数量的状态之间存在渐进转换。我们特别关注人类活动分析等应用，其中观测到的加速度计时间序列包含表示不同活动的片段，我们称之为纯态，以及由这些纯态之间持续转换特征的时期。为了捕捉这种瞬态行为，我们扩展了程式等人在2021年提出的动态Wasserstein媒介中心(DWB)模型[1]，将每个纯态与一个数据生成分布相关联，并将这些分布的连续转换建模为具有动态演化权重的Wasserstein媒介中心。针对在一元情况下可以通过闭合形式计算Wasserstein距离和媒介中心的情况，我们具体放宽了纯态的参数化。我们强调与确定唯一性相关的问题。",
