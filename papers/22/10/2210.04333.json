    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种多机器人任务和运动规划方法，用于通过机械手的排列来恰当地安排物体。该方法在解决方案时间上比现有方法快三个数量级，并成功地规划了多达20个物体的问题，比可比方法多三倍以上的物体。我们通过将规划空间分解为仅考虑机械手、物体和携带物体的机械手之间三个部分来实现这一改进。我们使用超图表示这种分解，其中顶点是规划空间的分解元素，超弧是元素之间的转换。现有方法使用基于图的表示，其中顶点是完整的复合空间，边缘是这些空间之间的转换。使用超图可以减小规划空间的表示大小，对于多机械手物体重排，超图顶点的数量随机器人或物体数量线性增加，而超边的数量随机械手数量线性增加。我们的方法还利用了源自于对所需重新抓取次数的严谨理论上界的新颖启发式。这个剪枝步骤消除了搜索树中许多无用的分支，加快了规划过程。我们在仿真中评估了我们的方法，包括拾取和放置、重排和构造任务，结果证明了规划时间的加快和处理比现有方法更大的问题的能力。",

This approach improves the planning speed and range while using a novel heuristic method that eliminates many fruitless branches of the search tree."
