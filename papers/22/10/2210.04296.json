    "translated_abstract": "基于得分的生成模型（SGM）学习一组与数据密度相对应的、噪声条件得分函数。这些扰动的数据密度通过福克-普朗克方程（FPE）相互联系，该方程是一种描述物质扩散过程的偏微分方程。在本文中，我们推导了一个对应的方程，称为得分FPE，其特征是扰动的数据密度（即它们的梯度）的噪声条件得分。令人惊讶的是，虽然DSM得分学习方法具有令人印象深刻的实证性能，但我们观察到学习到的得分未能满足底层的得分FPE，这是地面真实得分的固有自一致性属性。我们证明满足得分FPE是可取的，因为它可以提高似然度和守恒程度。因此，我们提出对DSM目标进行正则化，以强制满足分数FPE的要求。",
