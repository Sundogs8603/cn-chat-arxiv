In light of the recent promising results shown by direct speech translation (ST) models and the known weaknesses of cascades (error propagation and additional latency), in this paper we propose multitask models that jointly perform ST and NER, and compare them with a cascade baseline. The experimental results show that our models significantly outperform the cascade on the NER task (by 0.4-1.0 F1), without degradation in terms of translation quality, and with the same computational efficiency of a plain direct ST model.",

    "translated_abstract": "现代自动翻译系统旨在将人类放在中心位置，通过提供上下文支持和知识来实现这一目标。在这种情况下，一个关键任务是通过命名实体识别（NER）和实体链接系统来丰富输出的有关提到的实体的信息，而这目前是在生成的翻译上进行的。鉴于直接语音翻译（ST）模型的最近有希望的结果和级联系统的已知缺陷（误差传播和额外延迟），本文提出了多任务模型，共同执行ST和NER，并将它们与级联基线进行了比较。实验结果表明，我们的模型在NER任务上显著优于级联模型（0.4-1.0 F1），翻译质量没有降低，并且与纯ST模型相同的计算效率。",
