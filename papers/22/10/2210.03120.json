    "translated_abstract": "GBSVM（Granular-ball Support Vector Machine）是通过使用粗粒-球的粒度作为输入来构建分类器的重要尝试，而不是单个数据点。这是第一个输入不包含点的分类器。然而，现有模型存在一些错误，并且其对偶模型尚未被推导出。因此，当前算法无法实现或应用。为了解决这些问题，本文修复了现有GBSVM原始模型的错误，并推导出了其对偶模型。此外，设计了粒子群优化算法来解决对偶模型问题。还设计了顺序最小优化算法来解决对偶模型。该解决方案比基于粒子群优化的版本更快、更稳定。在UCI基准数据集上的实验结果表明，GBSVM具有良好的稳健性和效率。所有代码已在开源库http://上发布。",
