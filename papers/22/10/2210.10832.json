    "translated_abstract": "随着社会行动在网络上的盛行，品牌面临消费者对公开解决这些问题的压力。然而，在这些情境下，品牌应对策略（即是否以及如何回应）仍不清楚。本研究调查了消费者对品牌应对策略（如参与与否）在社会行动中的反应，并提供了品牌可以采取的可能有效的应对策略。通过分析从Twitter收集的现实数据并进行四个随机实验，本研究发现品牌关系类型（交换型、共享型）影响消费者在社会行动后对品牌的评估。当共享型（而非交换型）品牌不回应或采用低共情回应时，其被评估得较不利。当品牌采用高共情回应时，这种差异被减弱。这些发现归因于消费者对品牌回应策略是否符合品牌关系规范的感知。",
