    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，深度强化学习算法能够在模拟中学习复杂的机器人行为，包括多指操作领域。然而，由于模拟与现实之间存在差距，这样的模型在现实世界中的转移可能会很具挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了训练技术，可以让a）一种策略在类人机器人手中进行稳健的灵巧操作和b）一种适合提供可靠实时信息的鲁棒位姿估计器，用于被操作物体的状态。我们的策略经过在模拟中适应各种条件的训练。结果表明，我们基于视觉的策略在重新定向任务上明显优于文献中最好的基于视觉的策略，并且与通过运动捕捉系统提供特权状态信息的策略相竞争。我们的工作证实了敏捷操作在模拟到现实的转移中的可能性。",
