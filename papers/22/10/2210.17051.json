    "translated_abstract": "碳捕集和封存在全球减碳过程中扮演着至关重要的角色。扩大CO$_2$封存的规模需要准确高分辨率地建模储存库的压力积累和气态羽流动。然而，由于现有数值方法的高计算成本，在规模上进行这样的建模非常具有挑战性。这样的挑战导致评估封存机会存在显着不确定性，这可能会延迟大规模碳捕集和封存的步伐。我们介绍了嵌套傅里叶神经算子（Nested Fourier Neural Operator，FNO），这是一个机器学习框架，用于在盆地尺度上进行高分辨率动态三维CO$_2$封存建模。嵌套FNO使用一系列FNO的分层预测产生不同细化级别的预测结果，相对于现有方法，加快了将近700,000倍的流动预测速度。通过学习控制偏微分方程组家族的解算符，嵌套FNO为CO$_2$封存创建了一个通用的数值模拟器备选方案。",
