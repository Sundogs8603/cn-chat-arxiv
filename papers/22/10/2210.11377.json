    "translated_abstract": "我们提出并分析了Krylov-Bellman Boosting（KBB）算法，用于在一般状态空间中进行策略评估。该算法交替使用非参数回归（如提升）拟合Bellman残差，并使用随着时间增长而自适应增长的特征集合应用最小二乘时序差分（LSTD）过程来估计值函数。通过利用与Krylov方法的联系，我们为该方法提供了两种有吸引力的保证。首先，我们提供了一个通用的收敛界限，允许在残差拟合和LSTD计算中分别进行估计误差。与我们的数值实验一致，这个界限表明收敛速度取决于受限谱结构，通常是超线性的。其次，通过将这个元结果与残差拟合和LSTD计算的样本大小依赖保证相结合，我们得到了依赖于样本大小以及函数类复杂度的具体统计保证。",
