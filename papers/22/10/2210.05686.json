    "translated_abstract": "我们将摊余神经后验估计与重要性采样相结合，以实现快速准确的引力波推断。首先使用神经网络生成贝叶斯后验的快速建议，然后根据基本似然和先验计算重要性权重。这提供了（1）一个不受网络不准确性影响的校正后验、（2）评估建议和识别失败情况的性能诊断（样本效率）以及（3）贝叶斯证据的无偏估计。通过建立这种独立的验证和校正机制，我们解决了一些针对用深度学习进行科学推断的最频繁批评。我们进行了一项大型研究，使用SEOBv4PHM和IMRPhenomXPHM波形模型分析了LIGO和Virgo观察到的42个双黑洞合并案例。研究结果显示，中位样本效率约为10％（比标准采样器高两个数量级），同时状态空间体积减小了十倍以上。",
