    "translated_abstract": "当用于识别目标结构冲击的代理（外部工具）较弱时，代理-SVARs（SVAR-IVs）中的推断是非标准的，并且为了构建感兴趣冲击响应的渐近有效置信区间，需要使用弱工具鲁棒方法。在存在多个目标冲击的情况下，测试反演技术需要对代理-SVAR参数施加额外的限制，这些限制可能难以解释和测试。我们展示了在这些情况下可以通过最小距离估计和标准渐近方法进行频率学派渐近推断，前提是可以使用“强”工具对非目标冲击（即分析中不感兴趣的冲击）进行代理-SVAR的识别。建议的识别策略依赖于一种基于自助重采样的零仪器相关性预检验，该预检验不受预检验问题的影响，从而保证了其有效性。",
