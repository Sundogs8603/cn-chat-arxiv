    "translated_abstract": "本文全面回顾了早期检测树皮甲虫引起的树木死亡方面的过去和现有进展，从树皮甲虫与寄主之间的相互作用、遥感和机器学习/深度学习三个主要角度进行了总结。与以往的努力相反，本综述包括了所有遥感系统，并强调了机器学习/深度学习方法来研究它们的优势和劣势。我们根据多光谱或高光谱分析解析了现有文献，并从树皮甲虫物种和攻击阶段，重点关注攻击的早期阶段、寄主树木、研究区域、遥感平台和传感器、光谱/空间/时间分辨率、光谱特征、光谱植被指数（SVIs）、机器学习方法、学习方案、任务类别、模型、算法、类别/簇、特征和深度学习网络与架构方面提取知识。尽管基于深度学习的方法和随机森林（RF）算法显示出有希望的结果，突出了它们在可见光和热红外等波段上检测微小变化的潜力。",
