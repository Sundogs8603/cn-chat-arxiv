    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个基于语言知识的个性化自发语音合成的综合实证研究。随着语音克隆用于阅读风格的语音合成的出现，需要一种新的语音克隆范 paradigm 以实现类似人类和自发式语音合成。因此，我们专注于个性化自发语音合成，既可以克隆个体声音的音色，也可以模拟其言语不流畅。具体而言，我们处理了填充式停顿，这是言语不流畅的主要来源，在心理学和语言学中已被认为在言语生成和交流中起重要作用。为了比较评估个性化填充式停顿插入和非个性化填充式停顿预测方法，我们开发了一种语音合成方法，其中使用了训练有多说话人语料库的非个性化外部填充式停顿预测器。实验结果阐明了填充式停顿的位置-词汇纠缠问题，即需要准确预测位置以实现自然流畅性。",
