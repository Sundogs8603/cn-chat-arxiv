    "abstract": "Inspired by early research on exploring naturally annotated data for Chinese word segmentation (CWS), and also by recent research on integration of speech and text processing, this work for the first time proposes to mine word boundaries from parallel speech/text data. First we collect parallel speech/text data from two Internet sources that are related with CWS data used in our experiments. Then, we obtain character-level alignments and design simple heuristic rules for determining word boundaries according to pause duration between adjacent characters. Finally, we present an effective complete-then-train strategy that can better utilize extra naturally annotated data for model training. Experiments demonstrate our approach can significantly boost CWS performance in both cross-domain and low-resource scenarios.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究受早期对于探索汉语词分割天然注释数据的研究以及最近关于语音与文本处理集成的研究的启发，首次提出了从平行语音/文本数据中挖掘词边界的方法。首先，我们从两个与我们实验中使用的词分割数据相关的互联网源收集平行语音/文本数据。然后，我们获得字符级对齐，并根据相邻字符之间的停顿时长设计简单的启发式规则来确定词边界。最后，我们提出了一种有效的完整-然后-训练策略，可以更好地利用额外的天然注释数据用于模型训练。实验证明，我们的方法可以显著提高跨领域和资源匮乏场景下的词分割性能。",
