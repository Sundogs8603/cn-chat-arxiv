    "translated_abstract": "在当前研究中，针对时间数据的机器学习和深度学习解决方案，从单通道数据集（单元）向有多个信息通道的问题（多元）转移。其中大部分研究着重方法的创新和架构，输入数据的格式常常被隐含地对待。特别地，多元数据集常常被当作一系列单元时间序列的堆栈来进行输入预处理，采用单独对每个通道采用缩放方法。本研究旨在证明额外的通道维度远非微不足道，而不同的缩放方法可以显著影响解决方案的准确性。为此，我们在四个不同的时间维度上测试了七种不同的数据转换方法，并研究了它们对五种最近方法的分类准确性的影响。我们发现，对于大多数测试数据集，最佳的结果不是通过单独对每个通道进行缩放，而是通过利用通道之间的交互信息进行缩放来实现的。",
