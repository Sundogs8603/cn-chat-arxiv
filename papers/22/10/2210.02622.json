    "translated_abstract": "在模拟中预先训练多样化的神经网络控制器使得机器人能够适应运动任务中的损伤。然而，寻找多样性高且性能优异的控制器需要昂贵的网络训练和大量的超参数调整。相比而言，基于进化策略（ES）的质量多样性算法“协方差矩阵自适应MAP模拟”没有这些限制，并在标准的QD基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。然而，由于其二次复杂度，CMA-MAE无法扩展到现代神经网络控制器。我们利用ES中的高效近似方法提出了三种新的CMA-MAE变体，这些变体能够扩展到高维度。我们的实验表明，这些变体在机器人运动任务基准测试中优于ES基线，同时可与最先进的基于深度强化学习的质量多样性算法媲美或超越其性能。",
