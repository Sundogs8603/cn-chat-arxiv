    "translated_abstract": "天气和气候模拟产生的高分辨率数据达到了Petabyte级别，研究者需要对其进行分析以了解气候变化或恶劣天气。我们提出了一种新方法来压缩这种多维天气和气候数据：训练一个基于坐标的神经网络来过度拟合数据，然后取得到的参数作为原始基于网格数据的紧凑表示。虽然压缩比范围从300倍到超过3,000倍，但我们的方法在加权RMSE，MAE方面优于最先进的SZ3压缩器。它可以忠实地保留重要的大气结构并不会引入伪像。使用得到的神经网络作为790倍压缩数据加载器来训练WeatherBench预测模型，其RMSE只增加不到2%。三个数量级的压缩使得高分辨率气候数据得以民主化地访问，并使多个新的研究方向成为可能。",
