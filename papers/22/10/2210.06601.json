    "abstract": "The utilization of broad datasets has proven to be crucial for generalization for a wide range of fields. However, how to effectively make use of diverse multi-task data for novel downstream tasks still remains a grand challenge in robotics. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a framework that acquires goal-conditioned policies for unseen temporally extended tasks via offline reinforcement learning on broad data, in combination with online fine-tuning guided by subgoals in learned lossy representation space. When faced with a novel task goal, the framework uses an affordance model to plan a sequence of lossy representations as subgoals that decomposes the original task into easier problems. Learned from the broad data, the lossy representation emphasizes task-relevant information about states and goals while abstracting away redundant contexts that hinder generalization. It thus enables subgoal planning for unseen tasks, provides a compact input to the policy, and facilitates reward",

    "translated_abstract": "广泛数据集的利用已被证明对于各个领域的泛化都至关重要。然而如何有效利用多样化的多任务数据进行新领域下游任务的学习仍然是机器人学中的一大挑战。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一个框架，它通过离线强化学习在广泛的数据上获取未见过的时间延迟任务的目标条件策略，同时结合学习到的有损失表示空间下的子目标指导在线微调。当面对新的任务目标时，该框架使用机会模型来规划一系列有损表示作为子目标，将原始任务分解成更容易的问题。这些有损表示从广泛的数据中学习而来，它们强调有关状态和目标的任务相关信息，同时抽象出妨碍泛化的冗余内容。因此，它可以为未见过的任务提供子目标规划，为策略提供紧凑的输入，也为奖励提供了较好的抽象。",
