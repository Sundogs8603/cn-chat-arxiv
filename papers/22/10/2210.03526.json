    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个统一的硬约束框架，用神经网络解决几何复杂的偏微分方程，考虑了最常用的Dirichlet、Neumann和Robin边界条件。具体而言，我们首先从混合有限元方法引入“额外场”，重新构造偏微分方程，以等价的方式将三种类型的边界条件转化为线性方程。基于重新构造，我们对边界条件推导出通用解析解，用于构造一个符合边界条件的试验函数。有了这样一个框架，我们可以在不添加额外的损失项的情况下训练神经网络，从而有效地处理几何复杂的偏微分方程，缓解与边界条件和偏微分方程相对应的损失项之间失衡竞争的问题。我们在理论上证明了“额外场”可以稳定训练过程。在真实世界的几何复杂偏微分方程上的实验结果展示了我们方法的有效性。",
