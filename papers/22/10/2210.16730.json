    "translated_abstract": "模糊系统在各个领域都有广泛的应用，包括模式识别、智能控制、数据挖掘和生物信息学，这归功于其强大的解释和学习能力。在传统的应用场景中，模糊系统主要用于建模欧几里得空间数据，无法处理非欧几里得结构的图数据，比如社交网络和交通路线图。因此，开发适用于图数据并能保留传统模糊系统优势的建模方法是一个重要的研究课题。为了应对这个挑战，本文提出了一种适用于图数据建模的新型模糊系统，称为图模糊系统（GFS），并系统地开发了相关概念、建模框架和构建算法。首先，定义了GFS相关概念，包括图模糊规则库、图模糊集和图后件处理单元（GCPU）。然后构建了一个GFS建模框架。",
