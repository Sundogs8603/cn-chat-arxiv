FARE is based on our key insight that restricting the representation space of the encoder enables the derivation of practical guarantees, while still permitting favorable accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for suitable instantiations, such as one we propose based on fair trees.

    "translated_abstract": "公平性表示学习（FRL）是一种常用的方法，旨在通过数据预处理来产生公平分类器。最近的监管指令强调需要提供实际证书的FRL方法，即在任何预处理数据训练的下游分类器的不公平性上提供可证明的上限，从而直接在实际情况下提供保证。创建这样的FRL方法是一个重要的挑战，目前尚未解决。在这项工作中，我们解决了这一挑战，并引入了FARE（具有受限编码器的公平性），这是第一个具有实际公平性证书的FRL方法。FARE基于我们的关键洞见，即限制编码器的表示空间可以推导出实际的保证，同时仍然允许适当的准确度-公平度权衡，比如我们基于公平树提出的方法。为了产生实际的证书，我们开发和应用了一种统计过程，计算有限样本的h值。",
