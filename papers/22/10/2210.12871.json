    "abstract": "Neural networks have become critical components of reactive systems in various domains within computer science. Despite their excellent performance, using neural networks entails numerous risks that stem from our lack of ability to understand and reason about their behavior. Due to these risks, various formal methods have been proposed for verifying neural networks; but unfortunately, these typically struggle with scalability barriers. Recent attempts have demonstrated that abstraction-refinement approaches could play a significant role in mitigating these limitations; but these approaches can often produce networks that are so abstract, that they become unsuitable for verification. To deal with this issue, we present CEGARETTE, a novel verification mechanism where both the system and the property are abstracted and refined simultaneously. We observe that this approach allows us to produce abstract networks which are both small and sufficiently accurate, allowing for quick verification",

    "translated_abstract": "神经网络已成为计算机科学中各个领域反应性系统的关键组成部分。尽管其性能出色，但使用神经网络会带来许多风险，这些风险源于我们无法理解和推理其行为。针对这些风险，已提出了各种形式化方法来验证神经网络；但遗憾的是，这些方法通常面临可扩展性障碍。最近的尝试表明，抽象细化方法在缓解这些限制方面可能发挥重要作用；但这些方法通常会产生过于抽象的网络，使其不适合进行验证。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了CEGARETTE，一种新的验证机制，其中系统和属性同时进行抽象和细化。我们观察到，这种方法使我们能够产生既小又足够准确的抽象网络，从而实现快速验证。",
