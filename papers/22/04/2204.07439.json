    "translated_abstract": "二值神经网络（BNN）已成为降低深度神经网络内存占用和计算成本的有前途的解决方案，但由于激活和权重受限于二进制值，导致质量下降。为了弥补准确性下降，我们提出了一种新颖的BNN设计，称为具有实例感知阈值的二值神经网络（INSTA-BNN），它以输入相关或实例感知的方式动态地控制量化阈值。根据我们的观察，高阶统计量可以作为估计输入分布特征的代表性指标。INSTA-BNN被设计为根据各种信息（包括高阶统计量）动态调整阈值，但也经过精心优化，以实现在实际设备上的最小开销。我们进行了广泛的研究表明，INSTA-BNN在ImageNet分类任务上的性能优于基线3.0%和2.8%。",
