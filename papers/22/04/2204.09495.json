    "abstract": "Many studies have exposed the massive collection of personal data in the digital ecosystem through, for instance, websites, mobile apps, or smart devices. This fact goes unnoticed by most users, who are also unaware that the collectors are sharing their personal data with many different organizations around the globe. This paper assesses techniques available in the state of the art to identify the organizations receiving this personal data. Based on our findings, we propose ROI (Receiver Organization Identifier), a fully automated method that combines different techniques to achieve a 95.71% precision score in identifying an organization receiving personal data. We demonstrate our method in the wild by evaluating 10,000 Android apps and exposing the organizations that receive users' personal data.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多研究揭示了通过网站、移动应用或智能设备等方式在数字生态系统中对个人数据的大规模收集。大多数用户都没有意识到这一事实，并且也未意识到这些收集者与全球范围内许多不同的组织共享他们的个人数据。本文评估了现有技术中识别接收个人数据的组织的方法。基于我们的研究结果，我们提出了ROI（接收组织识别器），这是一种完全自动化的方法，结合了不同的技术来实现对接收个人数据的组织进行准确率达到95.71%的识别。我们通过评估10,000个安卓应用并揭示接收用户个人数据的组织来展示我们的方法。",
