    "translated_abstract": "鉴于一个输入状态、测量和概率的数据集，是否有可能有效地预测与量子电路相关的测量概率？ Caro和Datta（2020）的最新工作在信息理论意义上研究了PAC学习量子电路的问题，但存在计算效率问题。特别地，可能存在一种候选电路类可以进行有效学习，即Clifford电路，因为这种电路所生成的相应状态集合，称为稳定器状态，已知可以被有效地PAC学习（Rocchetto 2018）。在这里，我们提供了一个负的结果，展示CNOT电路的适当学习对于经典学习者来说是困难的，除非$\\textsf{RP} = \\textsf{NP}$。由于作为Clifford电路的经典模拟和子集，这自然地导致了Clifford电路的困难结果。此外，我们还展示了如果$\\textsf{RP} = \\textsf{NP}$，则存在一种能够高效求解半正定规划问题的随机多项式时间算法。",
