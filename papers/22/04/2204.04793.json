    "translated_abstract": "假新闻是社交网络和媒体面临的一个日益严重的挑战。虽然多年来检测假新闻一直是一个问题，但在最近几年社交网络的发展和新闻传播速度的增加之后，这个问题再次引起了关注。解决这个问题的几种方法之一是使用深度神经网络根据文本样式来检测假新闻。近年来，自然语言处理中最常用的深度神经网络形式之一是使用transformers进行迁移学习。BERT是最有希望的transformer之一，它在许多NLP基准测试中表现优异。本文介绍了MWPBert，它使用两个并行的BERT网络对全文新闻文章进行真实性检测。其中一个BERT网络编码新闻标题，另一个BERT网络编码新闻正文。由于BERT网络的输入长度是有限且常数，而新闻正文通常是一段长文本，我们无法将整个新闻文本输入到网络中。",

    "en_tdlr": "This article presents a method for detecting fake news using parallel BERT deep neural networks. By encoding the news headline and news body with two parallel BERT networks, and taking into account the input length limitation of BERT, this method enables effective detection of the veracity of fake news."
