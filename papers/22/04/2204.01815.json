    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种新的基于一致性的方法来定义和解决非负/正矩阵和张量补全问题。该框架的新颖之处在于，我们不是人为地将问题形式化为任意优化问题，例如，最小化一个结构量，如秩或范数，而是展示了一个单一的属性/约束：保留单位比例一致性，保证了解的存在，并在相对较弱的支持假设下保证了解的唯一性。该框架和解算法也直接推广到任意维度的张量中，同时保持了固定维度 d 的问题规模的线性计算复杂性。在推荐系统应用中，我们证明了两个合理的性质，这些性质应该适用于任何 RS 问题的解，足以允许在我们的框架内建立唯一性保证。关键理论贡献是展示了这些约束下解的存在性与唯一性。",
