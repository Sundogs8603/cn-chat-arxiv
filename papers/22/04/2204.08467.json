    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）允许多个医疗机构在未集中客户数据的情况下协同学习全局模型。由于来自各种扫描仪和患者人口统计学的医学图像的异质性，这种全局模型普遍实现每个客户的最佳性能是困难的，如果可能的话。当将全局模型部署到在FL期间未呈现的分布上看不见的客户时，这个问题变得更为重要。为了优化每个客户在医学成像任务中的预测准确性，我们提出了一个新的统一框架，用于FL中的“内部和外部模型个性化”（IOP-FL）。我们的内部个性化使用一种轻量级的基于梯度的方法，通过累积通用知识的全局梯度和客户特定优化的本地梯度，利用每个客户的本地适应模型。此外，我们还提出了一个外部个性化解决方案，通过一个客户自适应机制来应对来自未知客户的图像。实验结果表明，我们的方法可以大大提高单个客户的预测准确性，并且可以同时保持在不同客户之间的通用性。",
