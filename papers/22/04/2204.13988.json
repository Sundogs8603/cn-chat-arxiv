    "translated_abstract": "自2021年以来，文本到图像的生成引起了人们的极大关注。深度生成模型可以从文字输入（“提示”）中合成美丽和引人入胜的数字图像和艺术品。在线社区围绕文本到图像生成和AI生成艺术迅速出现。本文基于为期3个月的民族学研究，确定了网络社区中实践者使用的六种提示修改器。这个新颖的提示修饰分类学为研究文本到图像生成的实践提供了一个概念起点，同时也可能帮助AI生成艺术的实践者改进他们的图像。我们进一步概述了如何在“提示工程”实践中应用提示修饰器。我们讨论了这种新创意实践在人机交互领域的研究机会。文章在从人工智能交互的角度讨论提示工程的更广泛影响后结束。",
