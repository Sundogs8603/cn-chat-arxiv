    "translated_abstract": "选秀是分配异质且不可分割物品的顺序分配过程，涉及优先级顺序（例如，在职业体育联赛中将球员的合同权分配给团队）。代理人揭示物品的序数偏好，捆绑物品按成对比较进行部分排序。我们提供了一个简单的选秀规则描述：选秀规则是满足优先级尊重（RP）、一物无嫉妒（EF1）、非浪费（NW）和资源单调性（RM）的唯一分配规则。在体育联盟中，RP 和 EF1 对于竞争平衡至关重要。我们还证明了三个相关的不可能定理：（i）弱策略可信性（WSP）与 RP、EF1 和 NW 不相容；（ii）WSP 与 EF1、(帕累托) 效率（EFF）不相容；以及（iii）当存在两个代理人时，策略可信性（SP）与 EF1 和 NW 不相容。然而，选秀规则满足竞争平衡属性 RP 和 EF1，以及效率。",
