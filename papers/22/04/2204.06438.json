    "translated_abstract": "在许多实际例子中，自动决策算法导致了偏见，这引发了对公平算法设计的强烈关注。然而，公平和效益之间往往存在对立：公平算法可能提供较低的社会福利解决方案，而优化福利的算法可能非常不公平。这个问题在机器调度问题中得到了体现，对于n个作业，任何公平解的社会福利可能比最优福利差一个$\\Omega(n)$的因子。本文证明了，如果我们允许存在微不足道的偏见，公平和效能之间的对立是可以克服的：存在一些算法既是“几乎完全公平的”，又具有常数倍的效益比率，也就是说，它们能够保证输出的解决方案在社会福利上与最优福利之间相差一个常数倍的因子。具体来说，对于任何$\\epsilon>0$，存在具有效益比率$\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$的机制。",
