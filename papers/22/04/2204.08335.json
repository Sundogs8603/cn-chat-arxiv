When the annotation budget is limited, active learning can be used to select and annotate those observations that are likely to give the most gain in model performance. We propose an active learning algorithm that, in addition to selecting which observation to annotate, selects the precision of the annotation that is acquired. Assuming that annotations with low precision are cheaper to obtain, this allows the model to explore a larger part of the input space, with the same annotation budget. We build our acquisition function on the previously proposed BALD objective for Gaussian Processes, and empirically demonstrate the gains of being able to adjust the annotation precision in the active learning loop.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于监督学习，进行数据注释需要耗费大量成本。当注释预算有限时，可以使用主动学习来选择和注释那些可能在模型性能上获得最大收益的观测结果。我们提出了一种主动学习算法，除了选择要注释的观测结果外，还选择要获得的注释精度。假定具有低精度的注释比具有高精度的注释更便宜，这使得模型能够在相同的注释预算下探索输入空间的更大部分。我们在先前针对高斯过程提出的BALD目标基础上构建了我们的获取函数，并在实验中展示了能够调整主动学习循环中的注释精度的优势。",
