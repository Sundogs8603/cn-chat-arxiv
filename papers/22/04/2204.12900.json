To obtain pedestrian trajectories, we propose a novel cross-camera spatio-temporal model that integrates pedestrians' walking habits and the path layout between cameras to form a joint probability distribution.

    "translated_abstract": "本文关注如何从一个非覆盖的摄像头网络中的多个视频中检索出一个查询对象的身份。目前已有的方法往往依赖于视觉匹配或者考虑时间约束，但是忽略了摄像头网格的空间信息。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于跨摄像头轨迹生成的行人检索框架，将时间和空间信息结合起来。为了获取行人轨迹，我们提出了一种新颖的跨摄像头时空模型，它结合了行人的行走习惯和相邻摄像头之间的路径布局，形成了一个联合概率分布。这样的时空模型可以基于稀疏采样的行人数据在摄像头网络中实现。基于这个时空模型，可以通过条件随机场模型提取跨摄像头轨迹，并通过受限非负矩阵分解进行进一步优化。最后，文章提出了一种轨迹重新排序技术来提高检索效果。",
