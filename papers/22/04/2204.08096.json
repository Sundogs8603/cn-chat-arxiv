    "abstract": "This article presents a synthetic distracted driving (SynDD2 - a continuum of SynDD1) dataset for machine learning models to detect and analyze drivers' various distracted behavior and different gaze zones. We collected the data in a stationary vehicle using three in-vehicle cameras positioned at locations: on the dashboard, near the rearview mirror, and on the top right-side window corner. The dataset contains two activity types: distracted activities and gaze zones for each participant, and each activity type has two sets: without appearance blocks and with appearance blocks such as wearing a hat or sunglasses. The order and duration of each activity for each participant are random. In addition, the dataset contains manual annotations for each activity, having its start and end time annotated. Researchers could use this dataset to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms to classify various distracting activities and gaze zones of drivers.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种用于机器学习模型检测和分析驾驶员各种分心行为和不同凝视区域的合成分心驾驶（SynDD2）数据集（SynDD1的延续）。我们使用了三个车内摄像头在固定的车辆中收集数据，它们分别位于仪表盘、靠近后视镜和右侧上角的窗户位置。数据集包含两种活动类型：分心活动和凝视区域，每个参与者都有两个活动集：没有出现块和有出现块，例如戴帽子或太阳镜。每个参与者的每个活动顺序和持续时间都是随机的。此外，数据集包含每个活动的手动注释，标记其开始和结束时间。研究人员可以使用此数据集评估机器学习算法分类驾驶员各种分心活动和凝视区域的性能。",
