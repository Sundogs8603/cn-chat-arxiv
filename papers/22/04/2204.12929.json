    "translated_abstract": "随着加密货币市场中Pump-and-Dump计划（P＆Ds）的增多，提前检测此类欺诈活动以警示潜在易受影响的投资者变得至关重要。本文重点预测在计划的pump时间之前，列在目标交易所中的所有币的pump概率，这被我们称为目标币预测任务。针对这个问题，我们首先对Telegram中自2019年1月至2022年1月组织的最新的709次P＆D事件进行了全面研究。我们的经验分析揭示了P＆Ds的一些有趣的模式，例如pump的硬币呈现出内部信道的同质性和跨信道的异质性。这个发现启发我们开发一种新的基于序列的神经网络，称为SNN，通过位置注意机制将信道的P＆D事件历史编码为序列表示，以提高预测准确性。",
