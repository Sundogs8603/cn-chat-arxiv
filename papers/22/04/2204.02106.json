    "abstract": "The contribution presents a study on figurative language of the first months of the COVID-19 crisis in Italian online newspapers. Particularly, we contrast topics and metaphorical language used by journalists in the first and second phase of the government response to the pandemic in Spring 2020. The analysis is conducted on a journalistic corpus collected between February 24th and June 3rd, 2020. The analysis is performed using both quantitative and qualitative approaches, combining Structural Topic Modelling (Roberts et al. 2016), Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980), and qualitative-corpus based metaphor analysis (Charteris-Black, 2004). We find a significant shift in topics discussed across Phase 1 and Phase 2, and interesting overlaps in topic-specific metaphors. Using qualitative corpus analysis, we present a more in-depth case study discussing metaphorical collocations of the topics of Economy and Society",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了意大利线上报纸在新冠疫情爆发的头几个月中使用的比喻语言。特别地，我们对2020年春季政府对疫情应对的第一阶段和第二阶段的主题和隐喻语言进行了对比分析。研究基于2020年2月24日至6月3日期间采集的新闻语料进行，并结合了定量和定性方法，包括结构主题建模、概念隐喻理论和基于语料库的隐喻分析。我们发现在第一阶段和第二阶段讨论的主题方面存在显著变化，并且主题之间存在有趣的隐喻重叠。通过定性语料库分析，我们展示了经济和社会主题的隐喻搭配的更深入案例研究。",
