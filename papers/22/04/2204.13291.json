    "translated_abstract": "联邦机器学习作为解决机器学习中的数据饥饿和隐私问题的解决方案，在学术界和工业界迅速发展。作为一个广泛分布的系统，联邦机器学习需要各种系统设计思考。为了更好地设计联邦机器学习系统，研究人员介绍了多种模式和策略，涵盖了各种系统设计方面。然而，模式的多样性使设计师对何时采用哪种模式感到困惑。本文在对联邦机器学习进行系统文献综述的基础上，提出了一套选择联邦机器学习架构设计模式的决策模型，以协助对联邦机器学习知识有限的设计师和架构师。每个决策模型将联邦机器学习系统的功能需求和非功能需求映射到一组模式上。我们还澄清了这些模式的缺点。我们评估了这些模式的性能和可扩展性，以及它们在现实世界中的适用性。",
