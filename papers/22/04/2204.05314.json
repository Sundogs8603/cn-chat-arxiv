    "translated_abstract": "网络效应仅源于产品在经济市场中的普及率，产生附加价值。我们使用受统计物理启发的基于代理的模型，提出了一个关于（几乎）难以区分的货物的具有需求侧网络效应的竞争市场的极简理论，由统计相同的销售人员销售。当网络效应较弱时，该模型可以重现传统的微观经济学: 几乎完全竞争的统计稳态。随着网络效应的增加，我们发现市场中会出现一种鲁棒的非平衡相，这是因为市场中会自然出现和消失的新潮流。当销售人员快速调整价格时, 一个新兴的垄断者可以占领市场并削弱竞争力，导致对称性和遍历性破裂的转变。非平衡相同时展现了三个经验证实的现象，这些现象在竞争市场的标准理论中没有被包含：自发的价格波动、周期性市场占领事件和富人越来越富。",
