    "translated_abstract": "由于数据中存在未解决的物理现象，例如海上迷失的物体，导致Lagrangian漂移的重建通常具有不确定性。通常通过引入漂移的随机性来克服不确定性，但这种方法需要对建模不确定性做出特定的假设。本文通过提出一种纯数据驱动的框架，在灵活的环境中进行建模概率漂移，消除了这种约束。使用海洋环流模拟，通过模拟初始物体位置的不确定性，产生物体位置的概率轨迹。我们训练了一个漂移概率仿真器，给定完全已知的速度，可以对漂移概率进行一天的预测，并观察到与数值模拟的良好一致性。尝试了几种损失函数。然后，我们通过训练输入信息不完全的模型，对我们的框架进行了推广。在这些更难的情况下，我们观察到合理的预测，尽管在评估模型时，数据漂移的影响变得明显。",
