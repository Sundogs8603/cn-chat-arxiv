    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the significant advance in dense retrieval (DR) based on powerful pre-trained language models (PLM). DR models have achieved excellent performance in several benchmark datasets, while they are shown to be not as competitive as traditional sparse retrieval models (e.g., BM25) in a zero-shot retrieval setting. However, in the related literature, there still lacks a detailed and comprehensive study on zero-shot retrieval. In this paper, we present the first thorough examination of the zero-shot capability of DR models. We aim to identify the key factors and analyze how they affect zero-shot retrieval performance. In particular, we discuss the effect of several key factors related to source training set, analyze the potential bias from the target dataset, and review and compare existing zero-shot DR models. Our findings provide important evidence to better understand and develop zero-shot DR models.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于强大的预训练语言模型（PLM）的密集检索（DR）取得了显著进展。DR 模型在几个基准数据集上取得了出色的性能，但在零-shot检索设置下，它们显示出的竞争力不如传统的稀疏检索模型（例如BM25）。然而，在相关文献中，仍缺乏对零-shot检索的详细和全面的研究。在本文中，我们首次对 DR 模型的零-shot能力进行了全面的研究。我们旨在确定关键因素并分析它们如何影响零-shot检索性能。特别地，我们讨论了与源训练集相关的几个关键因素的影响，分析了目标数据集的潜在偏差，并回顾和比较现有的零-shot DR 模型。我们的发现为更好地理解和开发零-shot DR 模型提供了重要的证据。",
