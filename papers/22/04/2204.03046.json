    "abstract": "Result ranking often affects consumer satisfaction as well as the amount of exposure each item receives in the ranking services. Myopically maximizing customer satisfaction by ranking items only according to relevance will lead to unfair distribution of exposure for items, followed by unfair opportunities and economic gains for item producers/providers. Such unfairness will force providers to leave the system and discourage new providers from coming in. Eventually, fewer purchase options would be left for consumers, and the utilities of both consumers and providers would be harmed. Thus, to maintain a balance between ranking relevance and fairness is crucial for both parties. In this paper, we focus on the exposure fairness in ranking services. We demonstrate that existing methods for amortized fairness optimization could be suboptimal in terms of fairness-relevance tradeoff because they fail to utilize the prior knowledge of consumers. We further propose a novel algorithm named Vertic",

    "translated_abstract": "结果排名经常影响消费者满意度以及排名服务中每个项目的曝光量。仅根据相关性对项目进行排名会导致项目曝光分配不公平，从而为项目生产者/提供者带来不公平的机会和经济收益。这种不公平会导致提供者离开系统，并阻止新的提供者加入。最终，消费者会剩下更少的购买选项，消费者和提供者的效用都会受到损害。因此，对于双方来说，保持排名相关性和公平之间的平衡至关重要。本文聚焦于排名服务中的曝光公平性。我们证明了现有的公平性优化方法在公平性和相关性之间的权衡方面可能不是最优的，因为它们没有充分利用消费者的先验知识。我们进一步提出了一种名为Vertic的新算法。",
