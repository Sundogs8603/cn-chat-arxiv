Recent work has established guarantees for in-distribution generalization of quantum neural networks (QNNs), where training and testing data are drawn from the same data distribution. However, there are currently no results on out-of-distribution generalization in QML, where we require a trained model to perform well even on data drawn from a different distribution to the training distribution. Here, we prove out-of-distribution generalization for the task of learning an unknown unitary. In particular, we show that one can learn the action of a unitary on entangled states having trained only product states. Since product states can be prepared using only single-qubit gates, this advances the prospects of learning quantum dynamics on near term quantum hardware, and further opens up new methods for both the classical and quantum compilation of quantum circuits.",

    "translated_abstract": "泛化边界是评估量子机器学习（QML）训练数据要求的关键工具。最近的研究已经建立了量子神经网络（QNNs）在域内泛化的保证，其中训练和测试数据来自同一数据分布。然而，目前还没有关于QML中域外泛化的结果，其中我们要求训练出的模型在来自与训练分布不同的数据上表现良好。在这里，我们证明了对学习未知酉的越域泛化的能力。特别地，我们证明了即使仅仅训练到了乘积态，我们也可以学习到酉对纠缠态的作用。由于乘积态只需要使用单比特门就可以制备，这推动了在近期量子硬件上学习量子动力学的前景，并进一步为经典和量子电路的编译提供了新的方法。",
