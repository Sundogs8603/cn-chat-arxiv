    "abstract": "I address the decomposition of the differences between the distribution of outcomes of two groups when individuals self-select themselves into participation. I differentiate between the decomposition for participants and the entire population, highlighting how the primitive components of the model affect each of the distributions of outcomes. Additionally, I introduce two ancillary decompositions that help uncover the sources of differences in the distribution of unobservables and participation between the two groups. The estimation is done using existing quantile regression methods, for which I show how to perform uniformly valid inference. I illustrate these methods by revisiting the gender wage gap, finding that changes in female participation and self-selection have been the main drivers for reducing the gap.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对两组个体参与自主选择下的结果分布差异进行分解，同时区分了参与者与整个人群的分解，突出了模型原始组件对结果分布的影响。此外，本文还介绍了两种辅助分解方法，有助于揭示两组之间不可观测变量和参与度差异的来源。研究使用了现有的分位数回归方法进行估计，同时演示了如何进行统一有效的推断。以性别工资差距为例说明这些方法。结果表明，女性参与度和自我选择的改变是减小性别工资差距的主要驱动因素。",

It further shows that existing quantile regression methods can be used for estimation and inference, and applies the method to the gender wage gap, finding that changes in female participation and self-selection have been the main drivers for reducing the gap."
