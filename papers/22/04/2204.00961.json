These comprehensive guides evolved from the consideration of various personalized behavioral factors. Nevertheless, existing approaches frequently neglect the users dynamic behavior and the changing in their health conditions. This study aims to fill this gap by developing a machine learning algorithm that dynamically updates auto-suggestion exercise goals using retrospective data and realistic behavior trajectory. We conducted a methodological study by designing a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to evaluate exercise performance, considering fitness-fatigue effects. The deep reinforcement learning algorithm combines deep learning techniques to analyse time series data and infer user exercise behavior. In addition, we use ",
