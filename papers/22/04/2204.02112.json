BART combines \"weak\" tree models through a set of shrinkage priors, whereby each tree explains a small portion of the variability in the data. However, the lack of smoothness and the absence of an explicit covariance structure over the observations in standard BART can yield poor performance in cases where such assumptions would be necessary. The Gaussian processes Bayesian additive regression trees (GP-BART) model is an extension of BART which addresses this limitation by assuming Gaussian process (GP) priors for the predictions of each terminal node among all trees. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through applications to simulated and real-world data, surpassing the performance of traditional modeling approaches in various scenarios.",

    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯加法回归树 (BART) 模型是一种集成方法，由于其始终强大的预测性能和量化不确定性的能力，在回归任务中广泛且成功地使用。BART通过一组缩减先验将“弱”树模型组合起来，其中每个树解释了数据中的一小部分变异性。然而，标准BART模型中缺乏平滑性并且对观测值之间的协方差结构没有明确假设，这在需要这些假设的情况下可能导致性能较差。高斯过程贝叶斯加法回归树 (GP-BART) 模型是对BART的扩展，它通过假设每个终端节点的预测服从高斯过程先验来解决这一限制。通过对模拟和实际数据的应用来证明了模型的有效性，在各种情境下超越了传统建模方法的性能。",
