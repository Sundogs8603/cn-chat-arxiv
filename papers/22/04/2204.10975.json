    "translated_abstract": "现代数据集通常具有高维性，但数据位于低维流形中，可以揭示对数据分析至关重要的潜在几何结构。这类数据集的典型例子是细胞周期测量值的集合，其中过程的固有循环性可以表示为圆或球。受分析这些类型数据集的需求启发，我们提出了一种非线性降维方法，称为球面旋转成分分析（SRCA），它将几何信息纳入到降维过程中以更好地逼近低维流形。SRCA是一种通用的方法，旨在在高维和小样本大小的情况下工作。通过使用球体或椭球体，SRCA提供了数据的低秩球面表示，并在降维过程中有效地保留了数据集的几何结构。全面的模拟研究以及对人类细胞周期数据的成功应用证明了SRCA的有效性和多功能性。",
