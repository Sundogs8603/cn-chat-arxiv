    "translated_abstract": "脑瘫(CP)的早期诊断和干预是治疗过程中最重要的部分，因此有必要设计一种高效且可解释的自动预测CP的系统。我们发现CP婴儿的人体运动频率与健康组有显著差异，这提高了预测性能。然而，现有的基于深度学习的方法没有利用婴儿运动的频率信息进行预测。本文提出了一种基于频率注意力的图卷积网络，并在两个消费级RGB视频数据集(MINI-RGBD 和 RVI-38数据集)上进行验证。我们的频率注意力模块有助于提高分类性能和系统可解释性。此外，我们设计了一种频率分桶方法，可以保留人体关节位置数据的关键频率，同时过滤噪声。我们的预测性能在两个数据集上均达到了最新研究的最高水平。",
