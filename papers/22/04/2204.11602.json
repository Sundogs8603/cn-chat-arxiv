    "translated_abstract": "最近，深度神经网络（DNN）被广泛引入到协同过滤（CF）中，以产生更准确的推荐结果，因为它们具有捕获项目和用户之间复杂非线性关系的能力。然而，基于DNN的模型通常遭受高计算复杂性的问题，即消耗非常长的训练时间并存储大量可训练参数。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新的宽泛推荐系统，称为宽泛协同过滤（BroadCF），它是一种高效的非线性协同过滤方法。宽泛学习系统（BLS）被用作映射函数，以学习用户和项目之间的复杂非线性关系，可以避免上述问题，同时实现非常令人满意的推荐性能。但是，将原始评分数据直接馈送到BLS中并不可行。为此，我们提出了一种用户-项评级协同向量预处理程序，将原始数据转换为更适合BLS学习的格式。三个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，我们提出的BroadCF在推荐准确性和效率方面均优于几种最先进的CF方法。",

BroadCF achieves very satisfactory recommendation performance while avoiding the high computational complexity issues that DNN-based models usually face. They also propose a user-item rating collaborative vector preprocessing program to transform the original data into a more suitable format for BLS learning. The experimental results show that BroadCF outperforms several state-of-the-art CF methods in terms of both recommendation accuracy and efficiency."
