    "translated_abstract": "用户生成的产品评价是亚马逊和Yelp等在线商业的重要资产，而虚假评论则普遍存在以欺骗消费者。但是，使用图形拓扑的GNN是检测可疑评论者的最先进方法。但是，不同组的评论者检测准确性的差异可能会降低评论者的参与度并损害用户对评论网站的信任。与先前的观点不同，我们研究了组内子群结构，该结构也可能导致处理不同组时出现差异。本文解决了定义、近似和利用新子群结构进行公平垃圾信息检测的挑战。我们首先识别了评审图中导致组内准确性差异的子群结构。评论图中的复杂依赖关系会导致找出子群的难度。",
    "tldr": "本文通过发现组内子群结构，提高同等对待不同组的公正性、减少垃圾信息检测误差，对于提高评论者参与度和用户对评论网站的信任具有积极影响。"
