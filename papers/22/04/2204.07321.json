    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络已成为许多图级任务的主要架构，例如图分类和图生成。作为架构的重要组成部分，图池化对于获得整体的图级表示非常重要。虽然在这个充满希望和快速发展的研究领域中提出了许多方法，但据我们所知，很少有人努力系统地总结这些工作。为了为未来的工作奠定基础，本文试图通过提供最近关于图池化的方法的广泛回顾来填补这一空白。具体而言，1）我们首先提出了现有图池化方法的分类法，并为每个类别提供了数学概述；2）然后，我们提供了与图池化相关的库的概述，包括常用的数据集，下游任务的模型架构和开源实现；3）接下来，我们进一步概述了未来研究的方向和挑战。我们期望这个综述可以为进一步发展提供有益的参考。",
