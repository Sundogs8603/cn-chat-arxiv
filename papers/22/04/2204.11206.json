    "translated_abstract": "从观测数据中推断连续值处理的因果效应是一项关键任务，有望更好地为政策和决策制定者提供信息。 确定这些效应所需的关键假设是包括所有混淆变量——处理和结果的因果父母——作为协变量。 不幸的是，仅凭观测数据，我们无法确定这个标准是否得到满足。 当混淆变量被隐藏时，敏感性分析提供了一种原则性的方式来为因果估计提供界限。 虽然在离散值处理的灵敏度分析中受到了广泛关注，但对于连续值处理，却付出了更少的关注。 我们提出了新的方法，用于界定无法通过点估计进行识别的平均和条件平均连续值处理效应估计的范围，因为存在隐藏的混淆。 在多个数据集上进行的半合成基准测试显示出，我们的方法提供了更紧密的覆盖范围。",
