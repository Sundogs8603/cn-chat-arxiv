    "translated_abstract": "我们定义了一种新颖的“非回溯”矩阵概念，可与任何对称矩阵相关，并证明了相应的Ihara-Bass型公式。我们利用这个理论证明了关于$k$个变量每约束的随机约束满足问题（k-CSPs）的多项式时间强证明的新结果。对于由一个由$p$分数的分配满足的约束构建的随机k-CSP实例，如果实例包含$n$个变量和$n^{k/2} / \\epsilon^2$个约束，则我们可以有效地计算出最优解仅满足$p+O_k(\\epsilon)$个约束的证书。以前，这仅对于偶数$k$是已知的，但对于奇数$k$，需要$n^{k/2} (\\log n)^{O(1)} / \\epsilon^2$个随机约束才能得出相同的结论。虽然改进仅是对数级别的，但它克服了这类结果的一个重要障碍。",
