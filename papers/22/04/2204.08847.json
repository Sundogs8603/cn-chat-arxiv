    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了有限维再生核希尔伯特空间（RKHSs）中压缩经验测度的方法。在这种情况下，经验测度包含在一个自然的凸集中，并且可以使用凸优化方法来近似。在某些条件下，这种近似会导致数据点的coreset。控制这样一个coreset必须有多大的一个关键数量是包含在经验凸集中的经验测量周围的最大球的大小。我们的大部分工作是在各种条件下导出关于这样一个球的大小的高概率下限。我们通过开发技术，使得我们能够将压缩方法应用于具体的推断问题，如核岭回归，来补充这种下限的派生。我们最后介绍了一种无限维RKHS的构造，其中压缩很差，突出了我们面临的一些困难。",
