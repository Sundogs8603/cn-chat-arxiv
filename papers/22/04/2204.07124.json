    "translated_abstract": "动态治疗方案（DTR）在医学中用于根据患者异质性定制连续的治疗决策。然而，常见的学习最佳DTR的方法存在缺陷：它们通常基于结果预测而非治疗效应估计，或者使用线性模型，对于现代电子健康记录中的患者数据具有限制性。为了解决这些缺陷，我们开发了两种新的方法，用于有效处理复杂的患者数据，称为DTR-CT和DTR-CF。我们的方法基于数据驱动的异质性治疗效应估计，使用因果树方法（具体来说是因果树和因果森林），学习非线性关系，控制时间变化混淆，是双重稳健的和可解释的。据我们所知，我们的论文是第一篇为了学习最佳DTR而改编因果树方法的论文。我们使用合成数据和在抑郁症治疗背景下的真实世界数据应用程序来评估我们提出的方法。我们的结果表明，我们的方法在准确性和实际可解释性方面优于现有的方法。",

The methods are based on data-driven estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects using causal tree methods, specifically causal trees and causal forests, and are both non-linear and interpretable. Results show that the proposed methods outperform existing methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability in a real-world data application for treating depression."
