    "translated_abstract": "在预测中预测金融市场价格变动是一个受持续关注的话题。随着深度学习和自然语言处理（NLP）的进步以及以新闻文章、社交媒体帖子等形式提供的大量文本数据的可用性，越来越多的研究将基于文本的预测因素纳入预测模型中。我们通过引入弱监督学习，一种最近提出的NLP方法来解决文本数据无标签的问题，为这个领域做出了贡献。没有依赖变量，就不可能在自定义语料库上微调预训练的NLP模型。我们证实了使用弱标签微调的文本特征增强了预测价值，并提高了预测加密货币收益的准确性。更基本的是，我们所提出的建模范式——弱标记特定领域文本和微调预训练的NLP模型——在（金融）预测中普适适用。",
