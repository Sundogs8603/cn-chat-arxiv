    "translated_abstract": "给定一系列集合，每个集合都有一个时间戳并包含任意数量的元素，时间序列预测旨在预测后续集合中的元素。之前的时间序列预测研究主要关注元素建模，并通过用户与元素的互动间接表示每个用户的偏好。然而，用户偏好经常不断演变，不能完全用间接学习偏好的范式来捕捉演化趋势。为此，我们提出了一种连续时间用户偏好建模框架，用于时间序列预测，通过维护一个存储所有用户和元素状态的存储器来显式建模每个用户的演化偏好。具体而言，我们首先通过以非降序的时间顺序排列所有用户-集合交互来构建一个通用序列，然后按时间顺序从每个用户-集合交互中进行学习。对于每个交互，我们连续地建模用户偏好并使用记忆存储器进行维护。",
