    "translated_abstract": "由于机器学习应用需求的迅速增长，已经意识到有足够知识的数据科学家的数量无法跟随数字世界中不断增长的数据量和应用需求而扩展。为满足这一需求，已经开发出了几种自动机器学习（AutoML）框架，通过自动化构建机器学习流程来填补人类专业知识的差距。每个框架都带有不同的基于启发式的设计决策。在本研究中，我们对六种流行的AutoML框架（AutoWeka、AutoSKlearn、TPOT、Recipe、ATM和SmartML）在来自已建立的AutoML基准套件的100个数据集上执行了全面的评估和比较。我们的实验评估考虑了不同方面的比较，包括多个设计决策的性能影响，如时间预算、搜索空间的大小、元学习和集成构建。我们的评估结果表明，每个AutoML框架在不同性能指标方面都有其优点和缺点，框架的选择可能取决于手头任务的特定要求。",
