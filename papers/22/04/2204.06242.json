    "translated_abstract": "许多现实世界的系统不仅有来自单个数据源的数据，还有来自多个数据视角的数据。例如，在基因组医学中，患者可以通过来自不同分子层面的数据进行描述。利用具有结构稀疏性的潜变量模型是揭示数据视角内和跨视角变化的常用工具。然而，它们的可解释性较差，需要专家直接检查和解释每个要素。在这里，我们提出了MuVI，一种基于修改过的马蹄蚌先验的新型多视角潜变量模型，用于建模结构稀疏性。这有助于对有限的和噪声领域知识进行纳入，从而以内在可解释的方式分析多视角数据。我们证明了我们的模型在重建误差和精确度/召回方面优于现有的结构稀疏性建模方法，并且可以稳健地整合噪声领域专业知识。",
