    "translated_abstract": "在均场控制和均场博弈中，解决相应的McKean-Vlasov正反向随机微分方程(MV-FBSDEs)是一个核心问题。大多数现有的方法只适用于均场相互作用仅依赖于期望或其他矩的特殊情况，因此无法解决均场相互作用具有完全分布依赖性的问题。本文提出了一种用于计算具有一般形式均场相互作用的MV-FBSDEs的新型深度学习方法。具体而言，基于虚拟博弈，我们将问题重新表述为反复求解具有显式系数函数的标准FBSDEs。这些系数函数用于近似具有完全分布依赖性的MV-FBSDEs的模型系数，并通过使用从上一次迭代的FBSDE解模拟的训练数据来解决另一个监督学习问题来更新。我们使用深度神经网络来求解标准BSDEs并进行近似",
