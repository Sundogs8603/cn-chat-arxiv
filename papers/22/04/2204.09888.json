    "abstract": "Graph mining algorithms have been playing a significant role in myriad fields over the years. However, despite their promising performance on various graph analytical tasks, most of these algorithms lack fairness considerations. As a consequence, they could lead to discrimination towards certain populations when exploited in human-centered applications. Recently, algorithmic fairness has been extensively studied in graph-based applications. In contrast to algorithmic fairness on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data, fairness in graph mining has exclusive backgrounds, taxonomies, and fulfilling techniques. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction of existing literature under the context of fair graph mining. Specifically, we propose a novel taxonomy of fairness notions on graphs, which sheds light on their connections and differences. We further present an organized summary of existing techniques that promote fairness in graph mining. Final",

    "translated_title": "图挖掘中的公平性：综述",
    "translated_abstract": "过去几年中，图挖掘算法在各个领域扮演着重要角色。然而，尽管这些算法在各种图分析任务上表现出色，它们中的大多数缺乏公平性考虑。因此，在人类中心应用中使用时，它们可能会对某些人群造成歧视。最近，算法公平性在基于图的应用中得到了广泛研究。与独立同分布（i.i.d.）数据的算法公平性相比，在图挖掘中的公平性具有独特的背景、分类和实现技术。在本综述中，我们在公平图挖掘的背景下，全面而最新地介绍现有文献。具体而言，我们提出了一个新的图公平概念分类法，来阐明其联系和区别。我们进一步对促进图挖掘公平性的现有技术进行了有组织的总结。",
