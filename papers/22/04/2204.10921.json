Using paired behavioral and survey data provided by participants recruited from a representative sample in 2020 (n=1,181), we show that exposure to alternative and extremist channel videos on YouTube is heavily concentrated among a small group of people with high prior levels of gender and racial resentment. These viewers often subscribe to these channels (prompting recommendations to their videos) and follow external links to them. In contrast, non-subscribers rarely see or follow recommendations to videos from these channels. Our findings suggest YouTube's algorithms were not sending people down \"rabbit holes\" during our observation window in 2020, possibly due to changes that the company made to its recommender system in 2019. However, the platform continues to play a key role in facilitating exposure to content from alternative and extremist channels among dedicated audiences.",

    "translated_abstract": "网络平台是否促进了有害内容的消费？本研究利用2020年代表性样本（n=1,181）的行为和调查数据，揭示了在YouTube上观看替代和极端渠道视频的人群主要集中在高先前性别和种族反感水平的少数人之间。这些观众经常订阅这些频道（促使向他们的视频推荐），并关注外部链接。相反，非订阅用户很少看到或关注这些频道的视频。这些发现表明，我们观察的2020年期间，YouTube算法没有把人们带入“兔子洞”，可能是由于该公司在2019年对其推荐系统进行的更改。然而，该平台在促进专注观众接触替代和极端渠道的内容方面继续发挥着关键作用。",
