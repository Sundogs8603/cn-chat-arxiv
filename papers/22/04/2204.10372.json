    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在没有明确的动力学模型的情况下学习渐近稳定平衡点的吸引域的内部逼近问题。我们提出使用更宽松的包含性概念——循环，而不是利用带有有限不确定性的近似模型来找到包含在吸引域中的（稳定的）不变集。我们定义一个集合为$\\tau$-循环（相应地为$k$-循环），如果每个从该集合开始的轨迹在最多$\\tau$秒（相应地$k$步）后返回到该集合。我们证明，在温和的假设下，包含一个稳定平衡点的$\\tau$-循环集必须是其吸引域的子集。然后，我们利用这个特性开发了使用通过采样有限长度轨迹获得的循环反例来计算吸引域内部逼近的算法。我们的算法依次处理样本，这使得它们能够在初始离线运行之后继续执行。",
