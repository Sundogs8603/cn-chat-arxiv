    "translated_abstract": "实际世界中的图像识别系统经常遇到损坏的输入图像，这会导致分布偏移并降低模型的性能。这些系统通常在中央服务器中使用单个预测模型，并处理来自各种环境（如分布在城市或汽车中的摄像头）的图像。这样的单一模型在测试时间面临着以多种不同方式损坏的图像。因此，它们需要在测试过程中立即适应多个变形，而不是以高成本进行重新训练。测试时间自适应 (TTA)，旨在在不访问训练数据集的情况下调整模型，是可以解决这个问题的一种方法。现有的TTA方法确实能够很好地适应单一的污染。然而，在出现多种类型的污染时，适应能力受到限制，这更符合实际情况。我们推测这是因为分布偏移更加复杂，在多种污染情况下适应变得更加困难。事实上，我们预期...

Existing test-time adaptation methods have limited adaptation ability when facing multiple corruptions. This paper improves the adaptation ability to multiple corruptions by addressing the complex distribution shift problem."
