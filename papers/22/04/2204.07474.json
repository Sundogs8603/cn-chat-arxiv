    "abstract": "In the canonical persuasion model, comparative statics has been an open question. We answer it, delineating which shifts of the sender's interim payoff lead her optimally to choose a more informative signal. Our first theorem identifies a coarse notion of 'increased convexity' that we show characterises those shifts of the sender's interim payoff that lead her optimally to choose no less informative signals. To strengthen this conclusion to 'more informative' requires further assumptions: our second theorem identifies the necessary and sufficient condition on the sender's interim payoff, which strictly generalises the 'S' shape commonly imposed in the literature. We identify conditions under which increased alignment of interests between sender and receiver lead to comparative statics, and study applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "在经典的辩说模型中，比较静态一直是一个未解决的问题。我们回答了这个问题，界定了哪些条件下发信方的中期回报变化会使其最优选择更具信息量的信号。我们的第一个定理确定了一个粗略概念的“增加凸性”，我们证明这个定理刻画了发信方中期回报变化使其最优选择更加信息量不减的情况。为了加强这个结论为“更具信息量”需要进一步的假设：我们的第二个定理明确了发信方中期回报的必要和充分条件，这个条件严格推广了文献中常见的“S”形状。我们确定了发信方和接收方兴趣一致程度增加会导致比较静态的条件，并研究了应用场景。",
    "tldr": "本论文主要研究了辩说模型中的比较静态问题，通过界定发信方中期回报变化的条件，确定了发信方在选择信号时会更倾向于选择具有更多信息量的信号。此外，论文还研究了发信方和接收方兴趣一致程度增加对比较静态的影响，并探讨了相关应用。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the comparative statics problem in persuasion models, identifying the conditions under which the sender is more likely to choose signals with higher informational content by characterizing the shifts in the sender's interim payoff. Furthermore, the paper examines the impact of increased alignment of interests between the sender and receiver on comparative statics and explores potential applications."
