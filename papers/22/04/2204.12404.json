    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了一种基于群体级别分析的方法来解决工程基础设施预测建模中数据稀疏的问题。利用可解释的分层贝叶斯方法和操作机群数据，自然地将领域专业知识编码（和适当共享）到不同子群之间，分别代表（i）使用类型，（ii）部件或（iii）运行条件。具体而言，通过假设（和先验分布），利用领域专业知识来限制模型，使得方法能够自动在类似资产之间共享信息，以改善卡车机群的生存分析和风电场的功率预测。在每个资产管理示例中，通过合并推理，在机群上学习一组相关函数，以学习群体模型。当子机群在层次结构的不同级别上共享相关信息时，参数估计得到改进。反过来，具有不完整数据的群体自动借用统计强度。",
