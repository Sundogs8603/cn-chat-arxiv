    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的人关注设计能够对物品生产者或最不满意用户公平的推荐系统。受经济学不平等测量领域的启发，本文探讨了使用广义基尼福利函数（GGF）作为规范性准则来指定推荐系统应优化的方法。GGF根据人口普查中的排名对个体进行加权，将更多的权重放在处境较差的个体上以促进平等。根据这些权重，GGF最小化物品曝光的基尼指数，以促进物品之间的平等，或关注最不满意用户的特定分位数的性能。排名的GGF难以优化，因为它们是不可微分的。我们通过利用非平滑优化和可微排序中使用的投影算子来解决这个挑战。我们使用最多有15k个用户和物品的真实数据集进行实验，结果表明我们的方法可以通过优化GGF有效地促进排名公平性。",
