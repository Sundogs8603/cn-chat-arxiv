    "translated_abstract": "在图匹配问题中，我们观察两个图G和H，并通过最大化边协议的一些度量来找到它们顶点之间的赋值（或匹配）。我们假设观察到的图对G和H是从相关维格纳模型中抽取的，这是一个用于相关加权图的流行模型，其中G和H的邻接矩阵的元素是独立的高斯分布，并且G的每条边与H的其中一条边（由未知的匹配确定）相关联，边相关性由参数σ∈[0,1)描述。在本文中，我们分析了作为“有种子”的图匹配算法的“投影功率方法”（PPM）的性能，其中我们提供一个部分正确的初始匹配（称为种子）作为附加信息。我们证明，如果种子足够接近真实匹配，则PPM在高概率下会迭代改进种子并恢复真实匹配（或恢复最大化边协议）。",
