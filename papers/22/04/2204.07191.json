When the receiver hopes to make inferences based on the distribution of the data, the sender has an incentive to drop observations to mimic the distributions observed under better states. We use a continuum model to predict optimal play when datasets are large and find that, in the big-data limit, it is optimal for senders to play an imitation strategy, under which they submit evidence imitating the natural distribution under some desirable target state. Relative to full information, the partial pooling equilibrium with voluntary disclosure generates a loss in welfare to senders who either have little data or a favorable state, who optimally disclose their full dataset, but a benefit to senders with access to large datasets, who can profitably drop observations under low states.",
