    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了策略推荐对人工银行间市场表现的影响。金融机构根据公共推荐和个体信息制定借贷协议。前者通过强化学习的最优策略来模拟，旨在最大化系统的适应性并收集有关经济环境的信息。策略推荐直接或间接地影响金融行为者的信贷关系形成过程。通过低利率或高流动性供给的最优选择来合理引导，再根据银行代理的资产负债表信息来确认他们在市场内最适宜向客户提供的流动性和利率组合。通过将公共和私有信号相结合，金融机构能够通过逐渐建立有选择性附加的信贷连接而创建或修建他们的信贷网络，从而生成动态网络。研究结果表明，在这种情况下，核心-周边网络结构具有迅速稳定的形式。",
