    "translated_abstract": "大多数用于计算成像的深度学习模型回归一个重建图像。然而，在实践中，不适定性、非线性、模型不匹配和噪声常常合谋使这些点估计具有误导性或不足。贝叶斯方法将图像和（嘈杂的）测量建模为联合分布的随机向量，并旨在近似未知量的后验分布。最近，基于条件标准化流的变分推理方法是传统MCMC方法的有希望的替代方法，但它们具有缺点：对于中等到高分辨率图像，需要过多的内存和计算资源，并具有在难以处理的非线性问题中表现不佳的问题。在这项工作中，我们提出了C-Trumpets--专门设计用于成像问题的条件可逆流，大大减少了这些挑战。可逆性减少了内存占用和训练时间，低维潜在空间与固定体积的建筑创新相结合，使我们的方法在大规模实验中产生了最好的成果。",
