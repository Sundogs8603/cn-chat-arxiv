    "translated_abstract": "近来，由于在处理具有复杂约束的高维问题时具有高效性，避免了投影操作并通过较少的计算如线性优化（LO）计算的无投影在线学习受到了广泛关注。但是，以往的研究假定任何查询梯度都会立即显示，这在实践中可能并不成立，从而限制了其应用。为了解决这个限制，我们将在线Frank-Wolfe（OFW）算法和在线平滑无投影（OSPF）算法推广到延迟设置中，其中查询的梯度可以被任意回合延迟。具体而言，我们推广的OFW的主要思想是在收到任何延迟的梯度后执行类似于原始OFW的更新，并为每一轮播放最新的决策。此外，OSPF的基本改变是用考虑任意延迟的加权和替换了查询梯度的总和。在各种延迟假设下，我们建立了广义OFW和OSPF的亚线性遗憾保证，并显示它们的遗憾界与设计用于无延迟设置的现有算法相当或更好。",
