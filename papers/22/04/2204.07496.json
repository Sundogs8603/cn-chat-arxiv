When evaluated on a number of open-domain retrieval datasets, our re-ranker improves strong unsupervised retrieval models by 6%-18% absolute and strong supervised models by up to 12% in terms of top-20 passage retrieval accuracy.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种简单而有效的重新排序方法，以提高开放式问题回答中的段落检索。重新排序器使用零样本问题生成模型重新评分，该模型使用预训练的语言模型计算基于所检索到的段落的输入问题的概率。该方法可以应用于任何检索方法（如神经或基于关键字的检索），不需要任何域或任务特定的训练（因此，预计更好地推广到数据分布转移），并提供了查询和段落之间的丰富交叉注意（即必须解释问题中的每个令牌）。在多个开放域检索数据集的评估中，我们的重新排序器将强大的无监督检索模型中提高了6％-18％，并将强大的监督模型中的前20个段落检索的准确性提高高达12％。我们还通过简单地添加新的重新排序器来获得了新的开放域问答的最新结果。",
