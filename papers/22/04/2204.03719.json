This work proposes a standardized, exhaustive, and comprehensive experimental framework to evaluate algorithms in a collection of diverse and challenging imbalanced data stream scenarios. The experimental study evaluates 24 state-of-the-art data streams algorithms on 515 imbalanced data streams that combine static and dynamic class imbalance ratios, instance-level difficulties, concept drift, real-world and semi-synthetic datasets in binary and multi-class scenarios.

    "translated_abstract": "当涉及到对数据流进行分类时，类别不平衡会带来新的挑战。近期文献中提出了许多算法来解决这个问题，采用了各种数据级别、算法级别和集成方法。然而，关于如何评估这些算法存在缺乏标准化和共识的程序和基准的问题。本研究提出了一个标准化、详尽和全面的实验框架，以评估一系列多样且具有挑战性的不平衡数据流场景中的算法。实证研究评估了24个最先进的数据流算法在515个结合了静态和动态类别不平衡比例、实例级困难度、概念漂移、真实和半合成数据集的二元和多类情景下的不平衡数据流上。这导致了一个大规模的实证研究，比较了数据流挖掘领域最先进的分类器的优缺点。",
