    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统的个性化使得其变得非常有用，但同时也带来了过滤气泡的问题。既然系统一直在推荐用户感兴趣的物品，那么可能会让用户感到乏味并减少满意度。现有的研究主要集中在静态推荐中的过滤气泡问题，很难捕捉到过度曝光的影响。相反，我们认为研究过滤气泡问题在交互推荐中更加有意义，并且优化长期的用户满意度。然而，由于代价高，因此在线训练模型并不现实。因此，我们必须利用离线训练数据，并分离用户满意度的因果效应。为了达到这个目的，我们提出了一个反事实交互式推荐系统(CIRS)，它将离线强化学习(offline RL)与因果推断相结合。基本思想是：首先学习一个因果用户模型，以捕捉物品对用户满意度的过度曝光效应。",
