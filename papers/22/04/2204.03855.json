In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages neighboring languages to improve low-resource scenario performance, founded on the hypothesis that similar linguistic units in neighboring languages exhibit comparable term frequency distributions, which enables us to construct a Huffman tree for performing multilingual hierarchical Softmax decoding. This hierarchical structure enables cross-lingual knowledge sharing among similar tokens, thereby enhancing low-resource training outcomes. Empirical analyses demonstrate that our method is effective in improving the accuracy and efficiency of low-resource speech recognition.",

    "translated_abstract": "低资源语音识别长期以来一直备受困扰，本文提出了一种方法，利用邻近语言来提高低资源场景的性能。我们的假设是，在相邻语言中，类似的语言单元呈现出可比的词项频率分布，这使我们能够构建一个哈夫曼树来执行多语言的分层Softmax解码。这种分层结构能够实现类似标记之间的跨语言知识共享，从而增强低资源训练结果。经验分析表明，我们的方法有效地提高了低资源语音识别的准确性和效率。",
