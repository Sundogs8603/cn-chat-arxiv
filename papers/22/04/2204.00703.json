    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一种智能传感器（代理器件）组成的无线网络，用于监测动态过程并将测量结果发送给执行全局监测和决策的基站。智能传感器具备感知和计算能力，可以发送原始测量数据或在传输前进行处理。代理器件资源的限制导致了延迟和准确性之间的基本权衡。一方面，原始测量数据具有不准确但产生快的特点。另一方面，为了在资源受限平台上生成准确的测量数据，需要耗费相当的计算延迟。此外，如果处理后的数据也经过了压缩，则由于无线通信引起的延迟可能更高。因此，决定网络中的传感器何时何地传输原始测量数据或利用耗时的本地处理是具有挑战性的。为了解决这个设计问题，本文提出一种基于强化学习的方法来学习一个最优的感知设计策略。",
