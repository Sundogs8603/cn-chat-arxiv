    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了一种理性性质的概念，其中理性化关系可能取决于可行替代方案集。更确切地说，我们称一个选择函数为局部可理性化的，如果它由一组理性化关系所理性化，使得在一些可行集中两个替代方案之间的严格偏好在移除其他替代方案时得到保留。Tyson (2008)已经证明了，选择函数是局部可理性化的，当且仅当它满足Sen的$\\gamma$。我们通过提出一个自然的$\\gamma$加强来扩展了局部可理论性的理论，该加强通过PIP-传递关系精确地表征了局部可理性化，同时通过引入选择函数的$\\gamma$-覆盖作为其满足$\\gamma$的最精细的粗化。局部可理性化允许对满足$\\gamma$的社会选择函数包括经典选择函数如顶轮和革除集在内，提供统一的视角。",
