    "abstract": "Machine learning is increasingly used to discover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers from high-dimensional molecular data. However, a variety of factors related to experimental design may affect the ability to learn generalizable and clinically applicable diagnostics. Here, we argue that a causal perspective improves the identification of these challenges and formalizes their relation to the robustness and generalization of machine learning-based diagnostics. To make for a concrete discussion, we focus on a specific, recently established high-dimensional biomarker - adaptive immune receptor repertoires (AIRRs). Through simulations, we illustrate how major biological and experimental factors of the AIRR domain may influence the learned biomarkers. In conclusion, we argue that causal modeling improves machine learning-based biomarker robustness by identifying stable relations between variables and by guiding the adjustment of the relations and variables that vary between populations.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习逐渐被应用于高维分子数据中发现诊断和预后的生物标志物。然而，实验设计相关的多种因素可能会影响学习到可泛化且临床应用值高的诊断结果。本文认为从因果的角度来看可以提高机器学习诊断的鲁棒性，正式界定它们与机器学习诊断的鲁棒性和泛化能力的关系。具体而言，我们关注了适应性免疫受体库（AIRR）这样一种特定的高维标志物，并借助模拟实验阐明了与AIRR领域相关的主要生物和实验因素如何影响学习到的生物标志物。最后，我们认为因果建模通过确定变量之间的稳定关系并指导个体间关系和变量之间的调整，可以提高基于机器学习的生物标志物的鲁棒性。",
