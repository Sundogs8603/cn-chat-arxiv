    "translated_abstract": "经典的贝叶斯机制设计依赖于公共先验假设，但在实践中往往无法获得这样的先验知识。我们研究了放松这个假设的先验独立机制的设计：卖方向n个买家出售一个不可分割的物品，买家的估值从一个对卖方和买家都未知的联合分布中抽取；买家不需要形成对竞争对手的信念，而卖方假设该分布是从一个指定类中对抗性选择的。我们通过最坏情况的遗憾度量性能，即预期收入与实际机制收入之间的差异。我们研究了一组广泛的估值分布类，涵盖了各种可能的依赖关系：独立同分布（i.i.d.）分布、i.i.d.分布的混合分布、关联和可交换分布、可交换分布等。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文研究了在先验独立机制设计中，对于没有可用先验信息的情况下，卖方如何以最坏情况的遗憾度量来衡量机制的性能。通过研究多种估值分布类别，论文总结了关于放松先验假设的先验独立机制设计的可行性。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the robustness of second-price auctions in prior-independent mechanism design, considering the case where common prior information is not available. The paper measures the performance of the mechanism through worst-case regret and explores various valuation distribution classes to relax the assumption of common prior. The findings provide insights into the feasibility of prior-independent mechanism design."
