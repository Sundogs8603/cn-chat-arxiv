    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel graph clustering framework named CGC, which uses contrastive learning for self-supervised representation learning and introduces a tracking module to handle evolving graph topologies. CGC achieves state-of-the-art performance in community detection and tracking, especially for dynamic graphs, on various benchmarks."
