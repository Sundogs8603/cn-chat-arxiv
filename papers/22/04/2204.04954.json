    "translated_abstract": "现代推荐系统通常作为一个流式的单维排序列表呈现物品。近年来，在电子商务中有一种趋势，即推荐的物品以二维网格面板的形式组织，用户可以在竖直和水平方向上查看物品。在网格形式的结果面板中呈现物品对于推荐系统提出了新的挑战，因为现有模型都是设计用于输出序列列表，而网格面板中的插槽没有明确的顺序。直接将物品排名转换为网格（例如，预定义插槽的顺序）忽略了网格面板上用户特定的行为模式，并且不可避免地影响用户体验。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），用于在推荐系统的最终再排序阶段中放置物品到二维网格结果面板中。该模型被称为Panel-MDP，它以早期阶段的初始物品排序为输入。然后，模型将以用户喜好为导向，采用强化学习策略来决定如何排列物品。",
