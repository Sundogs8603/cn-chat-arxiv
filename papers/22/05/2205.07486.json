    "abstract": "When can an interest group exploit ideological and affective polarization between political parties to its advantage? We study a model where an interest group credibly promises payments to legislators conditional on voting for its favored policy. Legislators value voting as their friends within their party, and suffer an ideological-disutility upon voting against their party's ideologically preferred policy. Affective polarization, owing to its interpersonal nature, is modeled by assuming a legislator values distinguishing her voting decision from legislators in the opposite party. Our main finding is that an aggregate measure of relative cohesiveness of social networks in the two parties determines whether the interest group can profitably exploit increasing polarization. However, the significance of relative cohesiveness vanishes if there is no ideological polarization between the two parties.",

    "translated_abstract": "什么情况下，利益集团才能利用政党之间的意识形态和情感极化来获取利益？我们研究了一个模型，其中利益集团可信地承诺向立法者支付款项，条件是他们投票支持其支持的政策。议员们看重在党内的朋友投票，如果违反其党派的意识形态优先政策投票，则会受到一种意识形态上的不利。情感上的极化，由于其人际关系的本质，在模型中假设议员重视将其投票决策与反对党议员区分开来。我们的主要发现是，两个政党社交网络相对凝聚度的聚合度量确定了利益集团能否利用不断增加的极化获利。然而，如果两个政党之间没有意识形态 polarization，则相对凝聚度的意义将消失。",
