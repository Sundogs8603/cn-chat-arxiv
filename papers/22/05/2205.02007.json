    "translated_abstract": "我们正站在科学发现轨迹上一个重要的拐点上。随着社会的快速数字化转型，人类的科学知识和交流也在数字化的形式下不断增长。我们现在阅读和撰写的论文、预印本、书籍、代码、数据集、会议演示稿以及社交网络和协作和沟通平台上的交互等，大多已经以数字化的方式记录。这种转变导致了大量信息的创造和增长——其中很多已经可供公众获取——为分析和利用其的计算模型和系统开启了令人激动的机遇。与此同时，数据处理能力的指数增长推动了人工智能的显著进步，包括能够从非结构化文本中学习强大表示的大型神经语言模型。然而，需要进行重大改变，以在科学知识和交流的更大生态系统中有效整合这些进展，创建一种新的统一的科学交流范式。本文介绍了一种科学发现的计算变革——利用人工智能的最新进展，增强科学发现和交流的统一框架。我们展示了这个框架的潜力，提供了一个原型系统的初始实现，并讨论了未来的研究和发展方向。",
