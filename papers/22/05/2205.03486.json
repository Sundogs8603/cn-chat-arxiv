    "abstract": "Given a collection of vertex-aligned networks and an additional label-shuffled network, we propose procedures for leveraging the signal in the vertex-aligned collection to recover the labels of the shuffled network. We consider matching the shuffled network to averages of the networks in the vertex-aligned collection at different levels of granularity. We demonstrate both in theory and practice that if the graphs come from different network classes, then clustering the networks into classes followed by matching the new graph to cluster-averages can yield higher fidelity matching performance than matching to the global average graph. Moreover, by minimizing the graph matching objective function with respect to each cluster average, this approach simultaneously classifies and recovers the vertex labels for the shuffled graph. These theoretical developments are further reinforced via an illuminating real data experiment matching human connectomes.",

    "translated_abstract": "针对一组顶点对齐网络和一个额外的标签混淆网络，我们提出了一种利用顶点对齐集合中的信号来恢复混淆网络标签的方法。我们考虑将混淆网络与不同粒度下的顶点对齐集合中的平均网络进行匹配。我们证明并证实，在网络来自不同网络类的情况下，将网络聚类到类中，然后将新网络匹配到聚类平均值，可以比将其匹配到全局平均图产生更高的匹配性能。此外，通过最小化相对于每个聚类平均值的图匹配目标函数，这种方法同时对混淆图进行了分类和顶点标签恢复。这些理论研究通过一个有启示意义的真实数据实验匹配人类连接体来得到更多巩固。",
