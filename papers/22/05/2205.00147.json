    "translated_abstract": "自主系统（AS）经常使用深度神经网络（DNN）分类器，使它们能够在复杂、高维、非线性和动态变化的环境中运行。由于这些环境的复杂性，当DNN分类器面对开发过程中未识别的领域时，可能会在操作过程中输出错误分类。随着AS的数量增加，将系统从运行中移除进行重新训练变得不切实际。为增加AS的可靠性并克服这一限制，DNN分类器需要在操作过程中适应不同的操作领域，并能够使用少量样本（例如100个样本）进行重新训练。然而，已知在少量样本上重新训练DNN会导致灾难性遗忘。在本文中，我们介绍了一种名为动态增量正则化自适应（DIRA）的框架，用于使用正则化技术来实现DNN分类器的操作领域适应，从而克服灾难性遗忘并实现适应性。",
