    "translated_abstract": "随机微分方程（SDEs）是一个重要的框架，用于模拟具有随机性的动态，这在大多数生物系统中都很常见。将这些模型与实证数据进行整合的逆问题仍然是一个重大挑战。在这里，我们提出了一种方程发现方法，该方法将时间序列数据作为输入，分析细粒度波动并输出一个可以正确捕捉数据长时间动态的可解释SDE。我们通过将来自随机微积分文献的传统方法与最先进的方程发现技术相结合来实现这一点。我们在合成数据集上验证了我们的方法，并在两个时空尺度迥异的真实数据集上验证了该方法的普适性和适用性：（i）鱼群的集体运动，其中随机性起着关键作用，和（ii）单个细胞受限迁移，主要是遵循放松振荡。",
