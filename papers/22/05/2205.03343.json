Such models have a relevant effective dimensionality much smaller than the number of microscopic parameters. Because Jeffreys prior treats all microscopic parameters equally, it is from uniform when projected onto the sub-space of relevant parameters, due to variations in the local co-volume of irrelevant directions. We present results on a principled choice of measure which avoids this issue, leading to unbiased inference in complex models. This optimal prior depends on the quantity of data to be gathered, and approaches Jeffreys prior in the asymptotic limit. However, this limit cannot be justified without an impossibly large amount of data, exponential in the number of microscopic parameters.",

    "translated_abstract": "在有限数据的推断中，需要一个参数空间上的度量概念，最明确的是贝叶斯框架中的先验。在本文中，我们证明了当应用于典型的科学模型时，最出名的非信息选择，Jeffreys先验，引入了巨大的偏差。这类模型的有效维度显著小于微观参数的数量。因为Jeffreys先验平等地处理所有的微观参数，所以投影到相关参数的子空间上时是均匀的，这是由于无关方向的本地共体积的变化。我们提出了一种基于原则的量度选择，避免了这个问题，在复杂模型中导致无偏推断。这个最优先验取决于要收集的数据数量，并且在渐近极限下趋近于Jeffreys先验。但是，如果没有指数数量级的微观参数，这个极限是无法证明的。",
