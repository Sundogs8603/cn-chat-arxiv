    "translated_abstract": "在临床设置中，对部署的图像处理系统具备鲁棒性是至关重要的，特别是不能做出自信错误的预测。最流行的安全处理方法是训练能够提供其不确定性度量的网络，但这些网络往往在训练数据分布范围之外的输入情况下失败。最近，生成建模方法被提议作为一种替代方法；这些方法可以显式地量化数据样本的可能性，在执行进一步处理之前过滤掉任何超范围数据样本。在本文中，我们专注于图像分割，并评估了几种网络不确定性方法，针对头部CT中出血分割任务的远超范围( far-OOD )和接近超范围( near-OOD )情况。我们发现所有这些方法在超范围处理时都会提供自信错误的预测，因此不适合用于安全分割。我们提出一种基于Transformer的完整3D超范围检测模型，可以鲁棒地识别并排除超范围情况。相较于现有的最先进模型，我们提出的方法实现了更好的超范围性能，并且能够在超范围情况下提供可靠的分割结果。",
