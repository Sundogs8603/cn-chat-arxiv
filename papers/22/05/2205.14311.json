    "translated_abstract": "分子结构识别是将分子图像翻译成其图形结构的任务。化学文献中展示的绘图风格和约定的显着变化为自动化此任务带来了重大挑战。在本文中，我们提出了MolScribe，一种新颖的图像到图形生成模型，它明确地预测原子和键以及它们的几何布局来构建分子结构。我们的模型灵活地融合了符号化学约束，以识别手性并扩展缩写结构。我们还开发了数据增强策略，以增强模型对领域变化的稳健性。在合成和现实分子图像的实验中，MolScribe显着优于以前的模型，在公共基准测试中实现了76-93％的准确性。化学家们也可以轻松验证 MolScribe 的预测，该预测受其置信度估计和与输入图像的原子级对齐的控制。MolScribe是公开的。",
