    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的深度展开网络DECONET，用于基于分析稀疏性的压缩感知。DECONET联合学习一个解码器，用于从不完整、噪声测量中重构向量，以及一个冗余的稀疏分析算子，该算子在DECONET的各个层之间共享。此外，我们构建了DECONET的假设类并估计其相关的Rademacher复杂度。然后，我们利用这个估计结果为DECONET提供有意义的上限，用于评估DECONET的泛化误差。最后，在合成和真实数据集上评估了我们的理论结果的有效性，并与现有的展开网络进行比较。实验结果表明，我们提出的网络在所有数据集上始终优于基线，并且其行为符合我们的理论发现。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种名为DECONET的新型深度展开网络，可以用于基于分析稀疏性的压缩感知，能有效地重构向量并优于现有的展开网络，在估计了其泛化误差的基础上得出相关结论。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new deep unfolding network, called DECONET, for analysis-sparsity-based compressed sensing, which can effectively reconstruct vectors and outperforms existing unfolding networks. The associated Rademacher complexity is estimated to deliver meaningful upper bounds for the generalization error of DECONET. The experimental results indicate that the proposed network behaves according to the theoretical findings."
