    "translated_abstract": "在许多战略环境中，稳定的结果通常具有公开可见的玩家决策，但没有玩家抓住机会进行偏离。为了分析这种存在不完全信息的情况，我们引入了一种新颖的解概念——贝叶斯稳定均衡作为实证框架。我们的框架允许研究者对玩家的信息和均衡选择规则保持不可知状态。在玩家信息存在强假设的情况下，贝叶斯稳定均衡确定集会收缩到完全信息纯策略纳什均衡确定集中。此外，在其他因素相等的情况下，它比贝叶斯相关均衡确定集更紧。我们还提出了可计算的估计和推断方法。在一个应用中，我们研究了麦当劳和汉堡王在美国的战略进入决策。我们的研究结果突出了信息假设在游戏中的识别力，并提供了有关快餐行业竞争动态的新见解。",

The framework is more powerful than Bayes correlated equilibrium identified set and is applied to study the strategic competition between McDonald's and Burger King."
