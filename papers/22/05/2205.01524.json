    "abstract": "This paper studies the consequences of capturing non-linear dependence among the covariates that drive the default of different obligors and the overall riskiness of their credit portfolio. Joint default modeling is, without loss of generality, the classical Bernoulli mixture model. Using an application to a credit card dataset we show that, even when Machine Learning techniques perform only slightly better than Logistic Regression in classifying individual defaults as a function of the covariates, they do outperform it at the portfolio level. This happens because they capture linear and non-linear dependence among the covariates, whereas Logistic Regression only captures linear dependence. The ability of Machine Learning methods to capture non-linear dependence among the covariates produces higher default correlation compared with Logistic Regression. As a consequence, on our data, Logistic Regression underestimates the riskiness of the credit portfolio.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了捕获不同债务人违约驱动协变量之间的非线性依赖以及其信用组合整体风险性的后果。联合违约建模是经典的伯努利混合模型。通过应用于信用卡数据集，我们证明，即使在机器学习技术在将协变量作为功能对个别违约进行分类上仅略微优于逻辑回归的情况下，它们在组合层面上表现更好。这是因为它们捕捉到了协变量之间的线性和非线性依赖，而逻辑回归只能捕捉到线性依赖。机器学习方法捕捉协变量之间的非线性依赖的能力会产生较高的违约相关性，与逻辑回归相比。因此，在我们的数据上，逻辑回归低估了信用组合的风险性。",
