    "translated_abstract": "在俄罗斯联邦侵略乌克兰之前和之后的几周，俄罗斯国家媒体发布了大量误导性和彻底错误的信息。本文研究了这种协调信息运动，以便了解俄罗斯政府向英语读者宣传的最突出的国家媒体叙事。为此，我们首先使用大型语言模型MPNet对由包括俄罗斯新的“事实核查”网站waronfakes.com在内的十个不同亲俄宣传网站发布的文章进行句级主题分析。在这个生态系统中，我们展示了像katehon.com这样的小型网站在发布稍后由其他俄罗斯网站回响的主题方面非常有效。在分析了这组俄罗斯信息叙事之后，我们再分析它们与r/Russia和其他10个政治子reddit上的叙事和讨论主题的对应关系。使用MPNet和语义搜索算法将这些子reddit上的前10,000条评论分别翻译成俄语和英语，然后使用MUSE跨语言嵌入找到语义上类似的评论。最后，我们展示了Reddit上有关俄乌战争的讨论如何随时间演变以及这些讨论如何受到国家媒体叙事的影响的交互式可视化。",
