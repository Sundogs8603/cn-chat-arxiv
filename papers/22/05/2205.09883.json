    "abstract": "This paper uses rule search techniques for the early identification of emergency homeless shelter clients who are at risk of becoming long term or chronic shelter users. Using a data set from a major North American shelter containing 12 years of service interactions with over 40,000 individuals, the optimized pruning for unordered search (OPUS) algorithm is used to develop rules that are both intuitive and effective. The rules are evaluated within a framework compatible with the real-time delivery of a housing program meant to transition high risk clients to supportive housing. Results demonstrate that the median time to identification of clients at risk of chronic shelter use drops from 297 days to 162 days when the methods in this paper are applied.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文利用规则搜索技术，早期识别那些有可能成为长期或慢性住在无家可归者收容所的高风险人群。使用一家北美主要收容所服务与超过40,000人的12年交互数据集，采用优化修剪无序搜索(OPUS)算法，开发直观而有效的规则。在能够实现实时交付支持性住房计划的框架内，对这些规则进行了评估。结果表明，应用本文方法使得早期识别处于慢性无家可归者风险的客户的中位时间从297天降至162天。",
