    "translated_abstract": "垂直联邦学习是一种新兴的安全学习范式，利用跨机构私有数据，旨在通过启用广告主和发布者私有拥有的互补用户属性的联合学习来改进广告模型。然而，将它应用到广告系统时存在两个关键挑战：a）标记重叠样本的有限规模，以及b）实时跨机构服务的高成本。为了缓解这两个限制，本文提出了一种半监督分裂知识蒸馏框架VFed-SSD。我们认为：i）在广告系统中有大量未标记的重叠数据可用，ii）通过分解联邦模型，我们可以在模型性能和推理成本之间保持平衡。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a semi-supervised split distillation framework VFed-SSD to improve the learning effect of advertising models through joint learning of complementary user attributes. The framework exploits unlabeled overlapping data and balances between model performance and inference efficiency by decomposing the federated model. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance over other state-of-the-art vertical federated learning approaches."
