    "translated_abstract": "贫困是人类面临的基本问题之一。为了解决贫困问题，需要知道问题的严重程度。多维贫困指数(MPI)是一种广为人知的方法，用于衡量给定地区贫困问题的程度。计算MPI需要MPI指标的信息，这些指标是通过调查收集的二进制变量，代表贫困的不同方面，例如教育、健康、生活条件等。使用传统回归方法可以推断MPI指标对MPI指数的影响。然而，解决一个MPI指标是否可能会解决或导致其他MPI指标更多的问题并不明显，并且没有专门用于推断MPI指标之间经验因果关系的框架。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个框架，以推断贫困调查中的二进制变量的因果关系。我们的方法在我们知道真实因果关系的模拟数据集中表现更好。然后，我们将我们的框架应用于埃塞俄比亚家庭消费支出调查，发现水、电力和资产所有权等MPI指标对埃塞俄比亚的贫困水平影响最大。",
