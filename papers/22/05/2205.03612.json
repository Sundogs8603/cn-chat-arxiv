    "translated_abstract": "发展一种基于潜在生物机制而非主观症状对精神障碍进行诊断的新模型已成为一种新的共识。最近，使用功能连接（FC）进行精神障碍和健康对照的机器学习分类器被开发出来，用于确定大脑标记物。然而，现有的基于机器学习的诊断模型容易出现过拟合的情况（由于训练样本不足），在新的测试环境中表现差。此外，难以获得可解释的、可靠的大脑生物标记物来解释潜在的诊断决策。这些问题阻碍了其可能的临床应用。在本研究中，我们提出了BrainIB，一种新的图神经网络（GNN）框架，通过利用著名的信息瓶颈（IB）原理来分析功能磁共振图像（fMRI）。BrainIB能够识别大脑中最具信息量的边缘（即子图）并具有良好的泛化能力，适用于未见样本的场景。",
