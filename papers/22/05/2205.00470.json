In this research, we address the question to which extent bias occurs in medical FL and how to prevent excessive bias through reward systems. We first evaluate how to measure the contributions of institutions toward predictive performance and bias in cross-silo medical FL with a Shapley value approximation method.

    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）已经引起了研究者和实践者的高度关注，用于训练医疗机器学习（ML）模型。确保这些模型的可信度至关重要。特别是，偏差（定义为模型在不同子群体中预测性能的差异）可能导致对特定子群体的不公平，这是不可取的现象。在本研究中，我们研究了医疗FL中到底存在多少偏差，并如何通过奖励系统防止过度偏差。我们首先使用Shapley值近似方法评估了跨silomedical FL中衡量机构预测性能和偏差的贡献方法。在第二步中，我们设计了不同的奖励系统，激励对高预测性能或低偏差作出贡献。然后，我们提出了一种结合的奖励系统，激励作出贡献以提高预测性能和降低偏差。我们使用多个医学胸透来评估我们的工作。",
