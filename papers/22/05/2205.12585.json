    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理中许多任务需要提取给定条件下的关系信息，例如事件参数提取、关系提取和面向任务的语义解析。最近的研究通常针对每个任务分别提出复杂的模型，较少关注这些任务的共性，并缺乏一个统一的框架来处理所有这些任务。本文提出了TAGPRIME，旨在从统一的角度来解决这些关系结构提取问题。TAGPRIME是一种序列标记模型，将给定条件（例如事件触发器）的信息添加到输入文本中。通过在预训练的语言模型中使用自注意机制，这些条件信息使得输出的上下文表示包含更多关于给定条件的信息，从而更适合提取特定条件下的关系。在广泛的实验和分析中表明，TAGPRIME在各种任务和数据集上的表现优于最新的关系提取模型。",
