    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了由Lee和Shao（2018）最近引入的一类带鞅差分误差（FMMDE）因子模型的预测性能。FMMDE使得可以获取原系列的一个转换，以便将结果变量根据它们是否相对于过去信息条件均独立进行分区。我们在两个方面对文献做出了贡献。首先，我们提出了一种新的FMMDE因子选择方法。通过模拟实验，我们展示了我们的方法在多种面板数据规范的有限样本中的良好表现。其次，我们通过使用FRED-MD（美国经济的全面月度宏观经济数据库）进行广泛的预测练习，比较了FMMDE与替代因子模型规范的预测性能。我们的实证结果表明，FMMDE在预测实体部门的发展方面具有优势。",

Moreover, empirical findings from a forecasting exercise using FRED-MD indicate that FMMDE outperforms alternative factor model specifications in predicting the evolution of the real sector."
