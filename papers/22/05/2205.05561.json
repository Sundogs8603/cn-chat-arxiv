    "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning personalized treatment policies that are externally valid or generalizable: they perform well in other target populations besides the experimental (or training) population from which data are sampled. We first show that welfare-maximizing policies for the experimental population are robust to shifts in the distribution of outcomes (but not characteristics) between the experimental and target populations. We then develop new methods for learning policies that are robust to shifts in outcomes and characteristics. In doing so, we highlight how treatment effect heterogeneity within the experimental population affects the generalizability of policies. Our methods may be used with experimental or observational data (where treatment is endogenous). Many of our methods can be implemented with linear programming.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑学习个性化治疗策略的问题，这些策略是外部有效或广义化的：它们在除了实验（或训练）人群外的其他目标人群中表现良好。我们首先证明，对于实验人群而言，最大化福利的策略对于实验和目标人群之间的结果（但不是特征）分布变化具有鲁棒性。然后，我们开发了新的方法来学习对结果和特征变化具有鲁棒性的策略。在这样做时，我们强调了实验人群内的治疗效果异质性如何影响策略的普适性。我们的方法可以使用实验或观察数据（其中治疗是内生的）。我们的许多方法可以使用线性规划实现。",
