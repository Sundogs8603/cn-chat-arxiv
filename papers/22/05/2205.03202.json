    "translated_abstract": "该论文解决了一个关于设计简单和最优高阶方法以求解光滑且单调的变分不等式的开放且具有挑战性的问题。变分不等式涉及寻找$x^\\star \\in \\mathcal{X}$，使得对于所有的$x \\in \\mathcal{X}$，$\\langle F(x), x - x^\\star\\rangle \\geq 0$。我们考虑了$F$具有最多$(p-1)$阶导数的情况。对于$p=2$，我们扩展了立方正则化的牛顿方法以满足全局速率为$O(\\epsilon^{-1})$的变分不等式。通过一种另外的二阶方法，我们可以获得$O(\\epsilon^{-2/3}\\log\\log(1/\\epsilon))$的改进速率，但该方法需要一个非平凡的内循环线搜索过程。类似地，基于线搜索过程的高阶方法已被证明可以达到$O(\\epsilon^{-2/(p+1)}\\log\\log(1/\\epsilon))$的速率。然而，正如Nesterov所强调的，这样的过程不一定意味着在大规模应用中具有实际应用价值，因此我们需要一种简单且最优的高阶方法。",
