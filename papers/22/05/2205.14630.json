    "translated_abstract": "近年来，通过物理信息神经网络（PINNs）的发展，试图填补深度学习（DL）方法和科学计算中的分析或数值方法之间的差距。然而，PINN的训练和物理模型的最佳交错仍然存在许多复杂问题。在这里，我们介绍了物理激活函数（PAFs）的概念。这个概念提供了一种替代一般激活函数（AFs）如ReLU、tanh和sigmoid进行所有神经元计算的方法，而是使用基于研究现象的物理定律的通用AFs的数学表示。PAFs的公式可能受到问题解析解中的项的启发。我们表明，PAFs可以受到与研究现象相关的任何数学公式的启发，例如PDE系统的初始或边界条件。我们证明了PAFs在包括谐振运动等几个PDE中的优势。",
