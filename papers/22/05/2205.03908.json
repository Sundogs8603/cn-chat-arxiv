    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了公司异质性和市场垄断如何影响宏观经济的脆弱性，即长期衰退的概率。我们提出了一种理论，其中公司进入、竞争和要素供给之间的积极相互作用可以产生多个稳定状态。我们表明，当公司的异质性很大时，即使是小的暂时性冲击也可以引起公司退出并使经济进入一个竞争驱动的贫困陷阱。我们根据美国经济上不断上升的公司异质性的已知趋势来校准我们的模型，我们表明它们显着增加了经济缓慢复苏的可能性和持续时间。我们使用我们的框架来研究2008-09年的经济衰退，并证明该模型可以解释产出和大多数宏观经济聚合物与趋势的持久偏差，包括净进入、加权平均和劳动份额的行为。后危机经济数据也支持了我们的提出的机制。我们最后指出，公司补贴可以是防止经济陷入低增长均衡的强有力工具。",

The model calibration shows that the well-known trend of rising firm heterogeneity significantly increases the likelihood and length of slow recoveries."
