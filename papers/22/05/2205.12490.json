    "translated_abstract": "数据稀缺一直是限制事件抽取进展的主要因素。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种自训练与反馈（STF）框架，利用大规模无标签数据，并通过将其与相同句子的Abstract Meaning Representation（AMR）图进行比较，为每个新事件预测获取反馈。具体而言，STF包括（1）在现有事件注释上训练的基础事件抽取模型，然后应用于大规模无标签语料库以预测新的事件提及作为伪训练样本，和（2）一种新的评分模型，该模型对于每个新预测的事件触发器、一个参数、它的参数角色以及它们在AMR图中的路径进行估计，以表示伪标签的正确性。这些兼容性分数进一步作为反馈，鼓励或阻止模型在自训练过程中学习伪标签。在三个基准数据集上的实验结果表明了该方法的有效性。",
