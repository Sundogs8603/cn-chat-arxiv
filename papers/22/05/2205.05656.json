Rare diseases are challenging to be identified due to few cases available for machine learning and the need for data annotation from domain experts. We propose a method using ontologies and weak supervision, with recent pre-trained contextual representations from Bi-directional Transformers (e.g. BERT). The ontology-based framework includes two steps: (i) Text-to-UMLS, extracting phenotypes by contextually linking mentions to concepts in Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), with a Named Entity Recognition and Linking (NER+L) tool, SemEHR, and weak supervision with customised rules and contextual mention representation; (ii) UMLS-to-ORDO, matching UMLS concepts to rare diseases in Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO). The weakly supervised approach is proposed to learn a phenotype confirmation model to improve Text-to-UMLS linking, without annotated data from",

    "translated_abstract": "计算文本表型是从临床记录中识别患有某些疾病和特征的实践。由于机器学习可用的案例很少，且需要领域专家的数据注释，因此罕见病难以被识别。我们提出了一种利用本体和弱监督的方法，使用来自Bi-directional Transformers（例如BERT）的最新预训练上下文表示。基于本体的框架包括两个步骤：（i）文本到UMLS，使用命名实体识别和链接工具SemEHR，在上下文中链接提及到Unified Medical Language System（UMLS）中的概念来提取表型，并使用自定义规则和上下文提及表示进行弱监督；（ii）UMLS到ORDO，将UMLS概念与Orphanet罕见病本体（ORDO）中的罕见病匹配。提出了弱监督方法来学习表型确认模型，以改进文本到UMLS的链接，而无需注释数据。",
