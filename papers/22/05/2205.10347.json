We train a lightweight stochastic encoder to encode low-resolution images in the latent space of a pretrained HVAE.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在图像超分辨率问题中生成多样解决方案的问题。从概率的角度来看，可以通过从逆问题的后验分布中进行采样来实现这一点，这需要在高分辨率图像上定义一个先验分布。在这项工作中，我们提出使用一个预训练的分层变分自编码器（HVAE）作为先验。我们训练一个轻量级的随机编码器，将低分辨率图像编码到预训练HVAE的潜在空间中。在推理过程中，我们将低分辨率编码器和预训练的生成模型结合起来对图像进行超分辨率处理。我们在人脸超分辨率任务上证明了我们的方法在条件正则化流技术的计算效率和扩散方法的样本质量之间提供了有利的权衡。",
