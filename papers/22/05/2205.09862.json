    "translated_abstract": "模型网络交互的一种流行方法是将其表示为一个节点是代理者而边是交互的网络。这些交互通常有时间戳，从而导致了带有时间戳的边。许多现实世界的时间网络具有循环或可能循环的行为。例如，社交网络活动可能在一天中的特定时间增加。在本文中，我们主要关注对这种时间网络中的循环活动进行建模。作为起点，我们使用了随机块模型，这是模拟静态网络的一种流行选择，其中节点被分成 R 组。我们通过使用泊松过程来将该模型扩展到时间网络中以建模边。我们通过将时间线分割成 K 个段来使过程的参数依赖于时间。为了实现循环活动，我们要求只能使用 H < K 个不同的参数集，也就是说，几个不一定连续的段必须共享参数。",
