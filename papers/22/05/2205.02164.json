    "abstract": "In recent years economic complexity has grown into an active field of fundamental and applied research. Yet, despite important advances, the policy implications of economic complexity remain unclear or misunderstood. Here I organize the policy implications of economic complexity in a framework grounded on 4 Ws: what approaches, focused on identifying target activities and/or locations; when approaches, focused on timing support for related and unrelated activities; where approaches, focused on the geographic diffusion of knowledge; and who approaches, focused on the role played by agents of structural change. The goal of this paper is to provide a framework that groups, organizes, and clarifies the policy implications of economic complexity to facilitate its continued use in regional and international development.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，经济复杂性已经成为一个活跃的基础和应用研究领域。然而，尽管取得了重要进展，经济复杂性的政策启示仍然不清楚或被误解。本文以“4W”为基础构建了经济复杂性的政策启示框架：什么样的方法，着重于识别目标活动和/或位置；何时的方法，着重于支持相关和无关活动的时机；何地的方法，着重于知识的地理扩散；以及谁的方法，着重于结构性变革的推动者的角色。本文的目标是提供一个框架，将经济复杂性的政策启示进行分组、整理和澄清，以促进在区域和国际发展中的持续应用。",
