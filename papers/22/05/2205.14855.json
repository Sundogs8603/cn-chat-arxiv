Empowered by this leave-one-out perturbation theory, we provide a deterministic entrywise analysis for the performance of spectral clustering under mixture models.

    "translated_abstract": "奇异子空间扰动理论在概率与统计学中具有基础重要性，并在不同领域有着各种应用。我们考虑了两个任意的矩阵，其中一个是另一个矩阵的leave-one-column-out子矩阵，并为两个相应的奇异子空间之间的距离建立了一种新的扰动上界。该方法非常适用于混合模型，并产生比经典扰动界限（如Wedin定理）更尖锐和精细的统计分析。基于这种leave-one-out扰动理论，我们对混合模型下谱聚类的性能进行了确定性的逐元素分析。我们的分析得出了亚高斯混合模型谱聚类的指数误差率。对于各向同性高斯混合模型，该速率在较弱的信噪比条件下优于L{\\\"o}ffler等人的速率（2021）。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种leave-one-out奇异子空间扰动分析方法，通过建立扰动上界来测量两个矩阵的奇异子空间之间的距离。该方法适用于混合模型，相较于传统的扰动界限具有更尖锐和精细的统计分析能力。在亚高斯混合模型下，通过此方法进行的谱聚类具有显式的指数误差率，且在较弱的信噪比条件下优于之前的研究成果。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a leave-one-out singular subspace perturbation analysis method, which measures the distance between two matrices' singular subspaces by establishing a perturbation upper bound. The method is suitable for mixture models and provides sharper and finer statistical analysis compared to traditional perturbation bounds. For sub-Gaussian mixture models, spectral clustering performed with this method has an explicit exponential error rate and performs better under weaker signal-to-noise conditions than previous research."
