By designing robots to speak in a more social and ambient-appropriate manner we can improve perceived awareness and intelligence for these agents. We describe a process and results toward selecting robot voice styles for perceived social appropriateness and ambiance awareness. Understanding how humans adapt their voices in different acoustic settings can be challenging due to difficulties in voice capture in the wild. Our approach includes 3 steps: (a) Collecting and validating voice data interactions in virtual Zoom ambiances, (b) Exploration and clustering human vocal utterances to identify primary voice styles, and (c) Testing robot voice styles in recreated ambiances using projections, lighting and sound.

    "translated_abstract": "机器人在正式、安静、黑暗的环境或明亮、热闹、嘈杂的环境中应该如何说话？通过设计机器人以更社交和适应环境的方式说话，我们可以提高人们对这些代理人的感知意识和智能程度。我们描述了一种选择机器人语音风格以达到社交适应性和环境感知的过程和结果。由于野外语音获取的困难，理解人类在不同声学环境中如何调整自己的声音可能具有挑战性。我们的方法包括三个步骤：(a) 在虚拟的Zoom环境中收集和验证语音数据交互，(b) 探索和聚类人类的语音话语以识别主要的语音风格，以及(c) 使用投影、灯光和声音在再现的环境中测试机器人的语音风格。我们以餐饮服务场景作为概念验证环境。我们提供了使用Pepper机器人的不同风格的语音的结果，朝着在特定语境下说话的机器人。",
