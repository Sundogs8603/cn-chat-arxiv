    "translated_abstract": "引力透镜是由大质量物体产生的相对论效应，会弯曲其周围的时空。这是天体物理学中一个深入研究的课题，允许验证理论相对论结果并研究一些否则不可见的微弱天体物体。近年来，机器学习方法已被应用于支持引力透镜现象的分析，通过检测与亮度变化时间序列相关的图像数据集中的透镜效应。然而，当前的方法要么仅考虑图像而忽略时间序列数据，要么在最困难的数据集上实现相对较低的准确性。本文介绍了 DeepGraviLens，这是一种新颖的多模态网络，用于分类属于一个非透镜系统类型和三个透镜系统类型的时空数据。它在准确性方面超过当前的 state-of-art 方法，提高了约 19% 到 43%，具体取决于所考虑的数据集。",
