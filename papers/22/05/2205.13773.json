    "translated_title": "森林火灾模型：设计市场以恢复资产",
    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年里，夏季森林火灾已经成为加利福尼亚和美国的常态。这些火灾的原因多种多样。州政府会收取森林火灾基金来帮助受灾人员。然而，基金只在特定条件下发放，并且在整个加利福尼亚州均匀收取。因此，该项目的整体思路是寻找关于电力公司如何引发火灾以及如何帮助收取森林火灾基金或者公平收费以最大限度地实现社会影响的数量结果。该研究项目旨在提出与植被、输电线路相关的森林火灾风险，并将其与金钱挂钩。因此，该项目有助于解决与每个地点相关的森林火灾基金收取问题，并结合能源价格根据地点的森林火灾风险向客户收费，以实现社会的总盈余最大化。",
    "tldr": "该论文研究了如何设计一个市场来恢复由森林火灾造成的资产损失。研究通过分析电力公司引发火灾的原因，并将火灾风险纳入经济模型中，提出了收取森林火灾基金和公平收费的方案，以最大化社会影响和总盈余。"
