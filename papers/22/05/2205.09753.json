    "translated_abstract": "将驾驶场景编码为向量表示是自动驾驶的一个重要任务，可以使得轨迹预测等下游任务受益。驾驶场景通常涉及到不同类型的对象（智能体、车道、交通标志）以及对象之间丰富多样的语义关系。同时，元素之间也存在相对性，这意味着空间关系是一个相对概念，需要以自我中心的方式进行编码，而不是全局坐标系。基于这些观察，我们提出了异构驾驶图变换器（HDGT），将驾驶场景建模为一个具有不同类型节点和边的异构图。在异构图的构建中，我们根据多样的语义关系连接不同类型的节点。在空间关系编码中，节点的坐标以及其入边是在局部节点中心坐标系中表示的。",

    "en_tdlr": "HDGT is a method that models driving scenes as heterogeneous graphs for multi-agent trajectory prediction via scene encoding. It takes into account the different objects and diverse semantic relations in the driving scene, and uses an ego-centric approach for spatial relation encoding."
