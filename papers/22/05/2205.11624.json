    "translated_abstract": "冲突搜索（CBS）是一种流行的多智能体路径规划（MAPF）求解器，它采用一个低级单智能体规划器和一个高级约束树来解决冲突。现代大多数MAPF求解器主要集中于通过各种策略减少该树的大小来改进CBS，很少有方法修改低级规划器。通常现有CBS方法中的低级规划器使用无权重的成本启发式方法，而次优CBS方法还使用冲突启发式方法来帮助高级搜索。在本文中，我们展示了，与流行的CBS信念相反，加权成本启发式可以有效地与冲突启发式一起在两种可能的变体中使用。特别地，其中一种变体在几种情景和次优CBS方法中可以获得大幅加速，2-100倍。重要的是，我们发现性能与加权成本启发式相关，而不是与冲突起发式相关。",
