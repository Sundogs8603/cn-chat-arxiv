    "translated_abstract": "单变量分位数的统计分析已经很成熟。然而，对于多变量分位数的研究仍然有待深入。我们构建了基于藤蔓顺序相关的双变量（条件）分位数，使用藤蔓相关回归模型的水平曲线。藤蔓相关是一种由连续树形模型确定的图形模型，允许对边际分布和相关结构进行分开建模。我们引入了一种新的图形结构模型（由树序列给出），专为预测回归设置中两个响应的对称处理而设计。我们确立了模型的计算可行性和获得不同条件分布的简单方法。使用藤蔓相关，回归的典型不足，如需对预测变量进行转换或交互、共线性或分位数交叉，都可以避免。我们通过不同藤蔓相关分布来说明基于藤蔓相关的双变量水平曲线。",
