    "translated_abstract": "随着各种应用场景下的不断增多的传感器，连续监测已经变得无处不在。然而，所获取到的时间序列通常是高维的，难以解释。表现力强的深度学习模型已经成为降维的热门选择，但所得到的潜在空间通常难以解释。在本文中，我们提出了 SOM-CPC 方法，该方法可以在有组织的二维流形中可视化数据，同时保留了更高维的信息。我们解决了一个实际场景中尚未被广泛探索的具有挑战性的问题，即高速时间序列，并且在合成数据和真实数据（包括生理数据和音频记录）上展示了 SOM-CPC 优于强基线模型（如基于 DL 的特征提取，随后是常规降维技术，以及同时优化 DL 模型和自组织映射（SOM）的模型）。SOM-CPC 具有更好地理解高速时间序列数据中潜在模式的巨大潜力。",
