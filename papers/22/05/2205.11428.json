    "abstract": "Most of the developed localization solutions rely on RSSI fingerprinting. However, in the LoRa networks, due to the spreading factor (SF) in the network setting, traditional fingerprinting may lack representativeness of the radio map, leading to inaccurate position estimates. As such, in this work, we propose a novel LoRa RSSI fingerprinting approach that takes into account the SF. The performance evaluation shows the prominence of our proposed approach since we achieved an improvement in localization accuracy by up to 6.67% compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The evaluation has been done using a fully connected deep neural network (DNN) set as the baseline. To further improve the localization accuracy, we propose a deep reinforcement learning model that captures the ever-growing complexity of LoRa networks and copes with their scalability. The obtained results show an improvement of 48.10% in the localization accuracy compared to the baseline DNN model.",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数实现定位的解决方案依赖于RSSI指纹。然而，在LoRa网络中，由于网络设置中的扩频因子（SF），传统指纹可能缺乏无线电地图的代表性，导致位置估计不准确。因此，在本研究中，我们提出了一种考虑SF的新型LoRa RSSI指纹方法。性能评估显示了我们提出的方法的卓越性，因为与最先进的方法相比，我们实现了最多6.67％的定位精度提高。评估是使用基线全连接深度神经网络（DNN）进行的。为了进一步提高定位精度，我们提出了一种深度强化学习模型，以捕捉LoRa网络的不断增长的复杂性，并应对其可扩展性。所获得的结果显示，与基线DNN模型相比，在定位精度方面提高了48.10％。",
