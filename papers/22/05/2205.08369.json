    "translated_abstract": "随着可再生能源的渗透和电力行业的去监管与市场化，电力市场运营范式正在发生转变。在这些新范式下，优化投标策略和分配方法成为市场参与者和电力系统运营商的优先考虑问题，同时也存在着特征不确定、计算效率低、超前决策要求等障碍。为了解决这些问题，作为一种新兴的机器学习技术，相较于传统的优化工具，强化学习（RL）在学术界和工业界中扮演着越来越重要的角色。本文综述了RL在去监管电力市场运营中的应用，包括投标和分配策略优化等方面，基于150余篇精选的文献。对于每个应用，除了总结广义方法的范例之外，还重点阐述了最新的研究成果和未来的研究方向。",
    "tldr": "本文综述了RL在去监管电力市场中应用的最新研究成果和未来的研究方向，RL相较于传统优化工具具有优势，能够解决特征不确定、计算效率低等难题，是一种有效的方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest research results and future research directions of RL applications in deregulated power markets, which have advantages compared with conventional optimization tools and can solve problems such as uncertain characteristics and low computational efficiency. RL is thus an effective method for optimal bidding and dispatching strategy optimization."
