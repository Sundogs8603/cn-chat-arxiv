    "translated_abstract": "监督学习算法通常假设在训练和测试阶段有足够的内存来存储数据模型。然而，在物联网中，当数据以无限数据流的形式出现时，或者当学习算法部署在具有较少内存的设备上时，这个假设是不现实的。在本文中，我们将在线Mondrian Forest分类算法适应到在数据流上具有内存限制的情况下。具体而言，我们设计了五种内存不足策略，以在达到内存限制时更新Mondrian树的新数据点。此外，我们设计了修剪机制，在内存限制下使Mondrian树对概念漂移更加稳健。我们在各种真实和模拟数据集上评估了我们的算法，并最后给出了在不同情况下使用它们的建议：在所有配置中，Extend Node策略似乎是最佳的内存不足策略，而修剪机制则因具体情况而异。",
