    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted the lives of minorities, such as members of the LGBTQ community (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) due to pre-existing social disadvantages and health disparities. Although extensive research has been carried out on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on different aspects of the general population's lives, few studies are focused on the LGBTQ population. In this paper, we develop and evaluate two sets of machine learning classifiers using a pre-pandemic and a during-pandemic dataset to identify Twitter posts exhibiting minority stress, which is a unique pressure faced by the members of the LGBTQ population due to their sexual and gender identities. We demonstrate that our best pre- and during-pandemic models show strong and stable performance for detecting posts that contain minority stress. We investigate the linguistic differences in minority stress posts across pre- and during-pandemic periods. We find that anger wo",

    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19疫情的影响在少数族群中产生了不成比例的影响，如LGBTQ社群（女同性恋、男同性恋、双性恋、跨性别和酷儿）的成员，因为他们本身存在社会不利和健康差异。虽然对于COVID-19疫情对大众生活各个方面的影响进行了广泛研究，但很少有研究关注LGBTQ族群。本文利用疫情前和疫情期间的数据集开发和评估了两组机器学习分类器，以识别在Twitter上表现出少数群体压力的帖子。少数群体压力是LGBTQ族群成员由于其性别和性别认同而面临的独特压力。我们证明了我们最佳的疫情前和疫情期间模型表现出强大和稳定的性能，可以检测包含少数群体压力的帖子。我们研究了疫情前和疫情期间少数群体压力帖子的语言差异。我们发现愤怒是在疫情期间最显著的情绪表达。",
