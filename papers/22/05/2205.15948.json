    "translated_abstract": "在量子机器领域中，检测硅芯片中的二维材料是一个非常关键的问题之一。实例分割可以被认为是解决这个问题的一个潜在方法。然而，与其他深度学习方法类似，实例分割需要大规模的训练数据集和高质量的标注才能达到相当的性能。在实践中，准备训练数据集是一个挑战，因为标注者必须处理大图像，例如2K分辨率，并且在这个问题中存在极密集的对象。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的方法来解决二维量子材料标识中实例分割中缺失标注的问题。我们提出了一种新的机制来自动检测误判的对象，并采用基于注意力的损失策略来减少这些对象对总体损失函数的负面影响。我们在二维材料检测数据集上进行实验，并得到了令人满意的结果。",
