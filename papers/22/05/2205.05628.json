    "translated_abstract": "随着加密网络流量的普及，网络安全分析人员开始采用机器学习技术来解读其网络上的流量。然而，随着新的流量出现，超出了训练集的分布，机器学习模型可能变得陈旧。为了在这个动态环境中可靠地适应，机器学习模型必须提供上下文化的不确定性量化，然而这在网络安全领域中鲜有关注。不确定性量化在两方面是必要的，一是在标签分配时指示模型对于选择哪个类别存在不确定性，二是当流量不太可能属于任何预训练的类别时。我们提出了一个包含加密虚拟私人网络(VPN)的网络流量的新的公共数据集，该数据集包含了10个应用程序生成的带有标签的网络流量，并对应5个应用程序类别。我们还提出了一个机器学习框架，旨在快速训练模型并进行标注。",
