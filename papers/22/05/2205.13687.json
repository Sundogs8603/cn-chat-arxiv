    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑对等式约束的随机非线性优化问题进行统计推断。我们开发了一种全在线随机顺序二次规划（StoSQP）方法来解决这些问题，可以将其视为将牛顿法应用于一阶最优性条件（即KKT条件）。受最近数值二阶方法设计的启发，我们允许StoSQP自适应地选择任意随机步长$ \\bar {\\ alpha} _t $，只要$ \\ beta _t \\ leq \\ bar {\\ alpha} _t \\ leq \\ beta _t + \\ chi _t $，其中 $ \\ beta_t $ 和 $ \\ chi_t = o(\\beta_t) $ 是某些控制序列。为了降低二阶方法的主要计算成本，我们还允许StoSQP通过使用草图技术的高效随机迭代求解器来不精确地解决二次规划问题。值得注意的是，我们不要求逼近误差随着迭代的进行而减小。对于开发的方法，我们证明在温和的假设（i）下，它的计算复杂度最多为$ O(1 / \\ ep）$。",
