    "abstract": "We consider contests where participants have private information about their ability and the contest designer can manipulate the values of different prizes to influence effort. We study the effect on effort of two different interventions: increase in the value of prizes and increase in competition (transfer of value from worse to better prizes). We identify two natural sufficient conditions on the distribution of abilities in the population under which both interventions have opposite effects on effort. More precisely, we find that if the density of agents is decreasing in ability so that unproductive agents are more likely than productive agents, the two interventions encourage effort. And if this density is monotone increasing in ability, the interventions discourage effort. We discuss applications to the design of optimal contests in three different environments, including the design of grading contests. Assuming the value of a grade is determined by the information it reveals about",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑竞赛，参赛者拥有关于自己能力的私人信息，竞赛设计者可以操纵不同奖励的价值来影响努力。我们研究了两种不同干预措施对努力的影响：提高奖励价值和增加竞争（将价值从较差的奖项转移到较好的奖项）。我们确定了人口中能力分布的两个自然充分条件，这两个条件使得两种干预措施对努力产生相反的影响。更具体地，我们发现，如果代理商的密度随着能力的降低而减小，因此非生产性代理商比生产性代理商更有可能，那么这两种干预措施将鼓励努力。而如果这个密度是能力单调增加的，这两种干预措施会减少努力。我们还讨论了三种不同环境下优化竞赛设计的应用，包括评分竞赛的设计。我们假设一个等级的价值是通过信息来确定的，该信息揭示了有关代理商能力的信息。",
