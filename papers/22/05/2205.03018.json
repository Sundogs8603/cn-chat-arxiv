    "translated_abstract": "在印度语言环境中，转写非常重要，因为使用了多种文字，并广泛使用罗马化输入。然而，公开可用的训练和评估数据集很少。我们介绍了Aksharantar，这是最大的公开可用的印度语言转写数据集，通过从单语和平行语料库中挖掘，并收集人工注释数据而创建。该数据集包含了来自三个语言家族、使用12种文字的21种印度语言的2600万个转写对。Aksharantar比现有数据集大21倍，也是7种语言和1个语言家族中首个公开可用的数据集。我们还介绍了Aksharantar测试集，包含103k个单词对，涵盖19种语言，可以对本地词源词、外来词、频繁词和罕见词的转写模型进行细粒度分析。利用训练集，我们训练了IndicXlit，这是一个提高了性能的多语言转写模型。",
