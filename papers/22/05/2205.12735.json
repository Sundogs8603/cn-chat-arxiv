    "translated_abstract": "人工智能的最终目标之一是协助人类进行复杂的决策。神经符号学习旨在将符号技术的可解释性与深度学习从原始数据中学习的能力相结合，是实现此目标的一个有前途的方向。然而，大多数现有方法需要手动构建符号知识，而在考虑端到端训练时，这些方法要么仅限于学习确定的程序，要么仅限于训练二进制神经网络。在本文中，我们介绍了神经符号归纳学习器（NSIL），一种方法，它训练一个通用的神经网络，从原始数据中提取潜在的概念，并学习将潜在概念映射到目标标签的符号知识。我们方法的创新之处在于一种基于神经和符号组件的性能的训练方法，用于调整符号知识的学习。我们在三个不同的问题域上评估了NSIL的性能。",
