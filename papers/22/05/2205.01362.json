    "abstract": "As with many other tasks, neural networks prove very effective for anomaly detection purposes. However, very few deep-learning models are suited for detecting anomalies on tabular datasets. This paper proposes a novel methodology to flag anomalies based on TracIn, an influence measure initially introduced for explicability purposes. The proposed methods can serve to augment any unsupervised deep anomaly detection method. We test our approach using Variational Autoencoders and show that the average influence of a subsample of training points on a test point can serve as a proxy for abnormality. Our model proves to be competitive in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches: it achieves comparable or better performance in terms of detection accuracy on medical and cyber-security tabular benchmark data.",

    "translated_abstract": "与许多其他任务一样，神经网络在异常检测方面也非常有效。然而，很少有深度学习模型适用于检测表格数据集中的异常。本文提出了一种新的方法来根据TracIn（一种最初用于解释性目的的影响力测量）来标记异常。所提出的方法可以用于增强任何无监督的深度异常检测方法。我们使用变分自编码器对我们的方法进行了测试，并表明训练点对测试点的平均影响力可以用作异常的代理。我们的模型在医疗和网络安全表格基准数据上在检测准确性方面表现出与最先进方法相当或更好的性能。",
