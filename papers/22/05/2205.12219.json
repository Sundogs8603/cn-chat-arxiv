It can relieve people's burden of holding a controller all the time, allow multitasking, and make drone control more accessible for people with disabilities or with their hands occupied. To this end, we introduce Aerial Vision-and-Dialog Navigation (AVDN), to navigate a drone via natural language conversation. We build a drone simulator with a continuous photorealistic environment and collect a new AVDN dataset of over 3k recorded navigation trajectories with asynchronous human-human dialogs between commanders and followers. The commander provides initial navigation instruction and further guidance by request, while the follower navigates the drone in the simulator and asks questions when needed. During data collection, followers' attention on the drone's visual observation is also recorded. Based on the AVDN dataset, we study the tasks of aerial",

    "translated_abstract": "能够与人类进行对话并遵循自然语言指令是智能无人机（即无人机）的关键能力。它可以减轻人们一直握着控制器的负担，允许同时进行多项任务，使残疾人或手部占用者更容易控制无人机。为此，我们介绍了一种名为Aerial Vision-and-Dialog Navigation（AVDN）的无人机导航方法，通过自然语言对话来控制无人机的导航。我们构建了一个带有连续逼真环境的无人机模拟器，并收集了一组新的AVDN数据集，其中包括超过3,000个记录的导航轨迹以及指挥官和跟随者之间的异步人际对话。指挥官提供初始导航指令，并根据需要提供进一步的指导，而跟随者在模拟器中导航无人机并在需要时提问。在数据收集过程中，跟随者对无人机的视觉观察也被记录下来。基于AVDN数据集，我们研究了无人机导航的任务。",
