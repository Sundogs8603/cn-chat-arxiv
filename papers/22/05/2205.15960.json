Despite its success, NLP technology is only widely available for high-resource languages such as English and Chinese, while it remains inaccessible to many languages due to the unavailability of data resources and benchmarks. In this work, we focus on developing resources for languages in Indonesia. Despite being the second most linguistically diverse country, most languages in Indonesia are categorized as endangered and some are even extinct. We develop the first-ever parallel resource for 10 low-resource languages in Indonesia. Our resource includes datasets, a multi-task benchmark, and lexicons, as well as a parallel Indonesian-English dataset. We provide extensive analyses and describe the challenges when creating such resources. We hope that our work can spark NLP research on Indonesian and other underrepresented languages.",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理在机器翻译和搜索引擎等技术方面对社会产生了重大影响。尽管NLP技术获得成功，但仅适用于高资源语言，如英语和汉语，而对于许多语言仍然无法获得数据资源和基准。本文着眼于为印度尼西亚语言开发资源，尽管它是语言多样性第二，但大多数印尼语言都被归类为濒危语言，其中一些甚至灭绝了。我们为10种低资源印尼语言开发了第一个平行资源，包括数据集、多任务基准和词典，以及平行印尼语-英语数据集。我们进行了广泛的分析，并描述了创建这种资源时面临的挑战。我们希望我们的工作能够激发有关印尼语和其他代表性不足语言的NLP研究。",
