    "translated_abstract": "人工智能现在被认为是一项对人类生活产生广泛影响的通用技术。本研究旨在从研究者对该领域的贡献角度来理解人工智能以及机器学习的演变。为此，我们提出了几种衡量人工智能和机器学习研究者影响、影响力和领导力的指标，并通过研究自1969年首次举办国际人工智能联合会议 (IJCAI) 以来在主要人工智能和机器学习会议上发表的论文，对人工智能领域的发展和演变进行探索，从而在一定程度上对人工智能的历史和演变有了新的认识。人工智能的发展和演变导致了学术论文的增加，在过去的六十年来发表的文章数量也有所反映。我们构建了全面的引用合作与论文-作者数据集，并计算了合作引用关系。",
