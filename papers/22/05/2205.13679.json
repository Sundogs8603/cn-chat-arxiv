    "translated_abstract": "越来越多的人对设计用于有监督种子图匹配的图神经网络（GNNs）表示兴趣，这旨在仅利用拓扑信息和少量种子节点来匹配两个无标签图。然而，大多数先前用于此任务的GNNs使用半监督方法，这要求大量种子并不能学习可转移到未见图的知识。相比之下，本文提出了一种新的有监督方法，可以从训练集中学习如何仅用少量种子来匹配未见图。我们的SeedGNN架构融合了几个新颖的设计，受有关种子图匹配的理论研究的启发：1）它可以学习计算和使用来自不同跳数的类似证人信息，以一种可以推广到不同大小的图的方式；2）它可以使用易匹配的节点对作为新的种子，在后续层次中改善匹配效果。我们在合成和真实世界的图上评估了SeedGNN，并展示了显著的性能改进。",
