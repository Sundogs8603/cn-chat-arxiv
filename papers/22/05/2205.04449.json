    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种内省式深度度量学习（IDML）框架，用于对图像进行不确定性感知的比较。传统的深度度量学习方法在图像之间产生自信的语义距离，而不考虑不确定性水平。然而，我们认为一个好的相似性模型应该谨慎考虑语义差异，以更好地处理模糊的图像，从而实现更稳健的训练。为了实现这一点，我们提出使用语义嵌入和伴随的不确定性嵌入来表示图像，分别描述图像的语义特征和模糊度。我们进一步提出了一种内省式相似性度量，用于在考虑图像的语义差异和模糊度的情况下进行相似性判断。所提出的IDML框架通过不确定性建模改进了深度度量学习的性能，并在广泛使用的CUB-200-2011，Cars196和Stanford Online数据集上取得了最先进的结果。",
