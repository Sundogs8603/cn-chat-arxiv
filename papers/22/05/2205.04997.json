    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的多变量非参数多变点检测方法，使用分类器。我们构建了一个分类器对数似然比，利用类概率预测来比较不同的变点配置。我们提出了一种计算可行的搜索方法，特别适用于随机森林，称为changeforest。然而，该方法可以与任何产生类概率预测的分类器配对使用，我们通过使用k最近邻分类器来说明。我们证明了当与一致的分类器配对时，在单变点设置中，它能够一致地定位变点。在广泛的模拟研究中，我们的方法changeforest相较于现有的多变量非参数变点检测方法实现了改进的经验性能。我们为R，Python和Rust用户提供了changeforest软件包的高效实现。",
