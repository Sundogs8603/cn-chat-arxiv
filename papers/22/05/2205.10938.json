This characteristic underscores the need for a method to produce a diverse set of valid outputs, presenting different perspectives of the input data. We propose a simple yet effective diversity-enhancing scheme that builds upon an inherent property of the statements, their logic-types, by using a type-controlled table-to-text generation model. We demonstrate, through extensive automatic and human evaluations over the two publicly available Logical NLG datasets, that our proposed method both facilitates the ability to effectively control the generated statement type, and produces results superior to the strongest baselines in terms of quality and factuality-diversity trade-off.",

    "translated_abstract": "从表格数据中生成自然语言语句是一个具有一个输入和多个有效输出的过程（即逻辑 NLG）。这表明需要一种方法来产生多样化的有效输出，呈现出输入数据的不同角度。我们提出了一种简单但有效的多样性增强方案，利用语句的逻辑类型作为内在特征，使用一种类型受控的表格生成自然语言模型。我们通过对两个公开可用的逻辑 NLG 数据集进行广泛的自动化和人工评估，证明了我们提出的方法既促进了有效控制生成语句类型的能力，又在质量和事实多样性权衡方面产生了优于最强基线的结果。",
