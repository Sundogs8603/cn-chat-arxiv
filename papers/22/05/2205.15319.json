    "translated_abstract": "由于图神经网络（GNN）的广泛应用，已经有许多基于GNN的方法被设计用于知识图谱(KG)推理。GNN-based KG推理方法中一个重要的组成部分是传播路径，它包含每个传播步骤中所涉及的一组实体。现有方法使用手工设计的传播路径，忽略了实体与查询关系之间的相关性。此外，在更大的传播步骤中，涉及的实体数量会爆炸性增长。本文旨在学习一个自适应的传播路径，以过滤掉不相关的实体，同时保留有前途的目标。首先，我们设计了一种增量采样机制，它能够以线性复杂度保留附近目标和分层连接。其次，我们设计了一个基于学习的采样分布来识别语义相关的实体。大量实验证明，我们的方法强大、高效，并且是语义感知的。",
