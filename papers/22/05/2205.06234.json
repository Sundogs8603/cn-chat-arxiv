    "translated_abstract": "个性化医疗仍然是科学家们面临的重大挑战。机器学习和深度学习的快速发展使它们成为预测个体患者最合适治疗方法的可行替代方案。然而，为每个数据集开发定制模型的需要，缺乏对结果的解释以及高计算要求使许多人不愿使用这些方法。为节省时间并揭示模型内部的工作方式，SIBILA应运而生。SIBILA是一组应用了一系列可解释性算法以识别最相关输入特征的机器学习和深度学习模型集成方法。由于解释性算法可能不彼此一致，因此实施了共识阶段来估计每个变量对预测的全局贡献。SIBILA被装箱以在任何高性能计算平台上运行。尽管最初目的是作为命令行工具，但它也可通过用户友好的Web界面获得。",
