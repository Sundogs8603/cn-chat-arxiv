    "translated_abstract": "大多数监督学习方法假定训练阶段使用的数据来自目标人口。然而，在实际应用中，人们经常面临数据集偏移，如果不充分考虑，可能会降低预测器的性能。本文提出了一个称为DetectShift的新颖灵活的框架，可以量化和测试各种类型的数据集偏移，包括$(X，Y)$，$X$，$Y$，$X|Y$和$Y|X$分布的差异。DetectShift为从业人员提供有关其数据变化的见解，使他们能够利用源数据和目标数据重新训练或调整其预测器，特别适用于目标域缺乏标记样本的情况。该框架利用具有相同状态的检验统计量来量化各种偏移的大小，使结果更易于解释。此外，它既可以应用于回归和分类任务，也可以应用于不同类型的模型。",
