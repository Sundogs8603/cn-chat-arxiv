    "abstract": "Few-shot relational learning for static knowledge graphs (KGs) has drawn greater interest in recent years, while few-shot learning for temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) has hardly been studied. Compared to KGs, TKGs contain rich temporal information, thus requiring temporal reasoning techniques for modeling. This poses a greater challenge in learning few-shot relations in the temporal context. In this paper, we follow the previous work that focuses on few-shot relational learning on static KGs and extend two fundamental TKG reasoning tasks, i.e., interpolated and extrapolated link prediction, to the one-shot setting. We propose four new large-scale benchmark datasets and develop a TKG reasoning model for learning one-shot relations in TKGs. Experimental results show that our model can achieve superior performance on all datasets in both TKG link prediction tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，静态知识图谱中的少量关系学习受到了更大的关注，而对于时态知识图谱的少量学习几乎没有被研究。与知识图谱相比，时间知识图谱包含丰富的时间信息，因此需要时间推理技术进行建模。这在时间背景下学习少量关系提出了更大的挑战。本文基于之前的静态知识图谱中的少量关系学习，将两个基本的时态知识图谱推理任务（即内插和外插链接预测）推广到一次学习的境况。我们提出了四个新的大规模基准数据集，并开发了一个时间知识图谱推理模型，用于学习时态知识图谱中的一次性关系。实验结果表明，我们的模型在两个任务的所有数据集上都取得了优秀的性能。",
