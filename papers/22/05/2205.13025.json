    "abstract": "The Reconstruction Finance Corporation and Public Works Administration loaned 46 railroads over $802 million between 1932 and 1939. The government's goal was to decrease the likelihood of bond defaults and increase employment. Bailed-out railroads did not increase profitability or employment. Instead, they reduced leverage. Bailing out a railroad had little effect on its stock price, but it resulted in an increase in its bond prices and reduced the likelihood of a ratings downgrade. However, bailouts did not help railroads avoid defaulting on their debt. We find some evidence that manufacturing firms located close to railroads benefited from the bailouts.",

    "translated_abstract": "重建金融公司和公共工程管理局在1932年至1939年间向46家铁路公司发放了802多万美元的贷款，政府的目标是减少债券违约的可能性和增加就业。然而被纾困的铁路公司并没有增加盈利或就业，反而减少了杠杆比率。纾困铁路公司对其股票价格几乎没有影响，但导致其债券价格上涨并降低了评级下调的可能性。然而，纾困并没有帮助铁路公司避免债务违约。我们发现，一些位于铁路附近的制造业公司受益于这些纾困计划。",
