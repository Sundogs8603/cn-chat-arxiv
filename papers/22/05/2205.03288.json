We therefore propose cluster-level measures of leverage, partial leverage, and influence and show how to compute them quickly in most cases. The measures of leverage and partial leverage can be used as diagnostic tools to identify datasets and regression designs in which cluster-robust inference is likely to be challenging. The measures of influence can provide valuable information about how the results depend on the data in the various clusters. We also show how to calculate two jackknife variance matrix estimators efficiently as a byproduct of our other computations. These estimators, which are already available in Stata, are generally more conservative than conventional variance matrix estimators.

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一个名为summclust的新的Stata软件包，该软件包可以为具有聚类扰动的线性回归模型总结数据集的聚类结构。该模型的关键观察单位是群集。因此，我们提出了群集级别的杠杆、部分杠杆和影响度量，并展示如何快速计算它们。杠杆和部分杠杆的度量可以用作诊断工具，以识别可能难以进行集群鲁棒推断的数据集和回归设计。影响度量可以提供有关结果如何取决于不同群集中的数据的有价值信息。我们还展示了如何高效地计算两个杰克刀方差矩阵估计量，这是我们其他计算的副产品。这些估计量已经在Stata中可用，通常比传统的方差矩阵估计量更保守。summclust软件包计算我们讨论的所有数量。",
