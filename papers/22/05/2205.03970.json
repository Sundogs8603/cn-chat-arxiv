    "abstract": "This paper develops a novel method for policy choice in a dynamic setting where the available data is a multivariate time series. Building on the statistical treatment choice framework, we propose Time-series Empirical Welfare Maximization (T-EWM) methods to estimate an optimal policy rule for the current period or over multiple periods by maximizing an empirical welfare criterion constructed using nonparametric potential outcome time-series. We characterize conditions under which T-EWM consistently learns a policy choice that is optimal in terms of conditional welfare given the time-series history. We then derive a nonasymptotic upper bound for conditional welfare regret and its minimax lower bound. To illustrate the implementation and uses of T-EWM, we perform simulation studies and apply the method to estimate optimal monetary policy rules from macroeconomic time-series data.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种在多元时间序列条件下进行政策选择的新方法。建立在统计治疗选择框架的基础上，我们提出了时间序列经验福利最大化（T-EWM）方法，通过最大化使用非参数潜在结果时间序列构造的经验福利准则来估计当前或多个时期的最优政策规则。我们表征了T-EWM在什么条件下能够一致地学习到在时间序列历史给定条件福利下最优的政策选择。然后推导出了条件福利遗憾及其极小下界的非渐进上限。为了说明T-EWM的实现和应用，我们进行了模拟研究，并将该方法应用于从宏观经济时间序列数据中估计最优货币政策规则。",
