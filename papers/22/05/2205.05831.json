    "translated_abstract": "跨领域少样本元学习(CDFSML)解决了需要将知识从多个源领域转移到一个实例稀缺的目标领域，而目标领域的数据分布明显不同的学习问题。最近发布的CDFSML方法通常构建一个通用模型，将多个源领域的知识合并到一个主干特征提取器中。这样可以实现高效推理，但需要在添加新的源领域时重新计算主干。其中一些方法还与异构源领域主干架构不兼容。我们提出了特征提取器叠加(FES)，一种将来自一组主干的信息进行组合的新CDFSML方法，它可以直接使用异构预训练的主干，并且不需要维护一个需要在主干集合更新时重新计算的通用模型。我们提出了基本的FES算法，它受经典叠加方法元学习的启发。",

FES combines information from a collection of backbones, allowing the use of heterogeneous pretrained backbones without the need to maintain a universal model that needs to be recomputed."
