Our framework is grounded in the ``abduction, action, and prediction'' approach to answer counterfactual queries and handles two key challenges where (1) the states are hidden and (2) the model is dynamic. Recognizing the lack of knowledge on the underlying causal mechanism and the possibility of infinitely many such mechanisms, we optimize over this space and compute upper and lower bounds on the counterfactual quantity of interest. Our work brings together ideas from causality, state-space models, simulation, and optimization, and we apply it on a breast cancer case study. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to compute lower and upper bounds on a counterfactual query in a dynamic latent-state model.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提供了一个基于优化的框架来执行具有隐藏状态的动态模型中的反事实分析。我们的框架以“猜测、行动和预测”方法为基础，以回答反事实查询，并解决了两个关键问题：(1)状态是隐藏的，(2)模型是动态的。考虑到对潜在因果机制的缺乏了解以及可能存在无限多个这样的机制，我们在该空间上进行优化，并计算所关心的反事实量的上限和下限。我们的工作汇集了因果关系、状态空间模型、模拟和优化的思想，并应用于乳腺癌案例研究中。据我们所知，我们是第一个在动态潜在状态模型中计算反事实查询的上限和下限的研究。",
