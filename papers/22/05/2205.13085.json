    "abstract": "Complex diseases are caused by a multitude of factors that may differ between patients even within the same diagnostic category. A few underlying root causes may nevertheless initiate the development of disease within each patient. We therefore focus on identifying patient-specific root causes of disease, which we equate to the sample-specific predictivity of the exogenous error terms in a structural equation model. We generalize from the linear setting to the heteroscedastic noise model where $Y = m(X) + \\varepsilon\\sigma(X)$ with non-linear functions $m(X)$ and $\\sigma(X)$ representing the conditional mean and mean absolute deviation, respectively. This model preserves identifiability but introduces non-trivial challenges that require a customized algorithm called Generalized Root Causal Inference (GRCI) to extract the error terms correctly. GRCI recovers patient-specific root causes more accurately than existing alternatives.",

    "translated_abstract": "复杂疾病由许多因素引起，即使在相同的诊断类别中，这些因素可能在患者之间也会有所不同。然而，一些潜在的根本原因仍然可能在每个患者中引发疾病的发展。因此，我们专注于识别疾病的患者特定根本原因，即在结构方程模型中外生误差项的样本特定预测能力。我们从线性设置推广到异方差噪声模型，其中$ Y = m（X）+ \\varepsilon\\sigma（X）$，其中$m（X）$和$\\sigma（X）$分别代表条件均值和均值绝对偏差的非线性函数。该模型保持可识别性，但引入了一些非平凡的挑战，需要一种名为广义根因因果推断（GRCI）的定制算法来正确提取误差项。与现有的替代方法相比，GRCI更准确地恢复了特定患者的根本原因。",
