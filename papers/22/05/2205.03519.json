    "translated_abstract": "深度学习方法在各种计算机视觉任务中取得了成功。受到这一成功的启发，深度学习已经在磁共振成像（MRI）重建中进行了探索。特别是，将深度学习与基于模型的优化方法相结合已经显示出了相当大的优势。然而，对于一些MRI应用来说，通常需要大量的标记训练数据才能获得高重建质量，这是具有挑战性的。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为DURED-Net的新型重建方法，通过结合自监督去噪网络和插入式方法，实现了可解释的自监督学习用于MR图像重建。我们的目标是通过添加利用图像物理学的显式先验来提高MR重建中Noise2Noise的重建性能。具体地，利用正则化去噪（RED）实现了去噪网络在MRI重建中的发挥。实验结果表明，该方法在MRI重建中取得了良好的重建效果。",
