    "translated_abstract": "脑成像数据解码在脑机接口和神经表示研究中应用越来越广泛。由于受到个体之间变异的影响，解码通常是针对个体的，并且在个体间无法很好地推广。克服这一问题的方法不仅可以提供更丰富的神经科学见解，还可以使群体模型优于个体模型。本文提出了一种方法，利用类似自然语言处理中单词嵌入的主体嵌入来学习和利用个体间变化的结构作为解码模型的一部分，我们改编了 WaveNet 架构用于分类。我们将其应用于脑磁图像数据，15 个受试者观看了 118 种不同的图像，每个图像有 30 个样本，使用整个图像呈现后的 1s 窗口进行图像分类。我们表明，深度学习和主体嵌入的结合对于分类具有至关重要的作用。",
