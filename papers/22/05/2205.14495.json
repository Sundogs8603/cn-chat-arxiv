    "translated_abstract": "连续学习（CL）使模型和代理能够在学习一系列任务的同时解决标准深度学习方法的局限性，如灾难性遗忘。本文调查了影响无任务偏置CL和多任务（MTL）代理性能差异的因素。我们提出两个假设：（1）无任务偏置方法可能在数据、计算或高维度受限设置中提供优势，（2）更快的适应可能特别有益于连续学习设置，帮助缓解灾难性遗忘的影响。为了调查这些假设，我们引入了基于重放的循环强化学习（3RL）方法用于无任务偏置CL代理。我们在合成任务和Meta-World基准测试上评估了3RL，其中包括50个独特的操作任务。我们的结果表明，3RL优于基线方法，甚至可以超过其多任务等价物。",
