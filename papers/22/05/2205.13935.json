    "abstract": "A common assumption in causal inference from observational data is that there is no hidden confounding. Yet it is, in general, impossible to verify this assumption from a single dataset. Under the assumption of independent causal mechanisms underlying the data-generating process, we demonstrate a way to detect unobserved confounders when having multiple observational datasets coming from different environments. We present a theory for testable conditional independencies that are only absent when there is hidden confounding and examine cases where we violate its assumptions: degenerate & dependent mechanisms, and faithfulness violations. Additionally, we propose a procedure to test these independencies and study its empirical finite-sample behavior using simulation studies and semi-synthetic data based on a real-world dataset. In most cases, the proposed procedure correctly predicts the presence of hidden confounding, particularly when the confounding bias is large.",

    "translated_abstract": "在因果推断中，常见的假设是没有隐式混淆。然而，在单个数据集中不能确定这个假设通常是不可能的。在独立的数据生成过程下，我们展示了一种方法来在多个来自不同环境的观测数据集中检测未观察到的混淆因素。我们提出了一种测试可验证的条件独立性的理论，这种独立性仅当存在混淆因素时才不存在，并检查了违反其假设的情况：退化和依赖机制以及忠实度违反。此外，我们提出了一种程序来测试这些独立性，并使用基于真实世界数据的半合成数据和模拟研究研究其经验有限样本行为。在大多数情况下，提出的程序能够正确预测存在隐式混淆，特别是当混淆偏差很大时。",
