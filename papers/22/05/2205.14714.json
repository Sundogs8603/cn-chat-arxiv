    "translated_abstract": "在利用观察数据进行因果推断时，条件平均处理效应（CATE）估计是主要挑战之一。除了基于机器学习的模型外，还开发出了称为元学习器的非参数估计器以估计CATE，其主要优点是不局限于特定的监督学习方法。然而，当处理不是二进制的时，一些朴素扩展的限制会出现，这样的任务就变得更加复杂。本文研究了元学习器用于估计多值处理异质效应。我们考虑了不同的元学习器，理论分析了它们的误差上界作为重要参数的函数，例如处理水平的数量，结果显示，朴素扩展并不总是提供满意的结果。我们引入和讨论了一些元学习器，它们在处理数量增多时表现良好。通过模拟研究和一项乙肝治疗研究的真实数据示例，我们证实了元学习器的优缺点。",
