    "translated_abstract": "尽管图神经网络在多个图分析任务中取得了巨大成功，但现代变体主要依赖于同质性的强归纳偏差。然而，现实世界的网络通常同时显示同质性和异质性的链接模式，其中相邻节点可能具有不同的属性和不同的标签。因此，GNN在整体上平滑节点接近性可能会聚合任务相关和不相关（甚至有害）的信息，限制了它们推广到异质图的能力，并可能导致非鲁棒性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种创新的边分割GNN（ES-GNN）框架，以自适应地区分对学习任务相关或不相关的图边。这将原始图转化为两个具有相同节点集但具有独占边集的子图。在这两个子图上分别进行信息传播和边分割，从而使信息传播和边分割交替进行，实现了解耦。",
