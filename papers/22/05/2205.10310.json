    "abstract": "The 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act mandates overtime premium pay for most U.S. workers, but it has proven difficult to assess the policy's impact on the labor market because the rule applies nationally and has varied little over time. I use the extent to which firms bunch workers at the overtime threshold of 40 hours in a week to estimate the rule's effect on hours, drawing on data from individual workers' weekly paychecks. To do so I generalize a popular identification strategy that exploits bunching at kink points in a decision-maker's choice set. Making only nonparametric assumptions about preferences and heterogeneity, I show that the average causal response among bunchers to the policy switch at the kink is partially identified. The bounds indicate a relatively small elasticity of demand for weekly hours, suggesting that the overtime mandate has a discernible but limited impact on hours and employment.",

    "translated_abstract": "1938年《公平劳动标准法》规定大多数美国工人必须支付加班工资，但由于该规定适用于全国，并且随时间变化很小，因此很难评估该政策对劳动力市场的影响。本文利用公司在每周40小时的加班门槛处的员工扎堆程度来估计该规定对工时的影响，利用来自个体工人每周工资单的数据。为此，我推广了一种常用的识别策略，该策略利用决策者选择集中的拐点处的扎堆现象。在只做出关于偏好和异质性的非参数假设的基础上，我表明扎堆者对于在拐点处政策转变的平均因果响应是部分被确定的。界限显示出每周工时的需求弹性相对较小，这表明加班规定对工时和就业有明显但有限的影响。",
