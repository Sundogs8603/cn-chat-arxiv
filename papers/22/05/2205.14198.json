    "abstract": "Clustering is a fundamental building block of modern statistical analysis pipelines. Fair clustering has seen much attention from the machine learning community in recent years. We are some of the first to study fairness in the context of hierarchical clustering, after the results of Ahmadian et al. from NeurIPS in 2020. We evaluate our results using Dasgupta's cost function, perhaps one of the most prevalent theoretical metrics for hierarchical clustering evaluation. Our work vastly improves the previous $O(n^{5/6}poly\\log(n))$ fair approximation for cost to a near polylogarithmic $O(n^\\delta poly\\log(n))$ fair approximation for any constant $\\delta\\in(0,1)$. This result establishes a cost-fairness tradeoff and extends to broader fairness constraints than the previous work. We also show how to alter existing hierarchical clusterings to guarantee fairness and cluster balance across any level in the hierarchy.",

    "translated_abstract": "聚类是现代统计分析流程的基本构建模块。近年来，公平聚类受到机器学习界的广泛关注。我们是第一批在Ahmadian等人在2020年的NeurIPS结果之后研究分层聚类公平性的人。我们使用Dasgupta的成本函数进行评估，这可能是分层聚类评估中最常见的理论指标之一。我们的工作将先前的$ O(n^{5/6}poly \\ log（n))$成本公平近似大大改进为接近多对数$ O(n^\\delta poly \\ log（n))$的成本公平近似，其中任何常数$\\delta \\ in（0,1）$。这个结果建立了成本公平权衡，并扩展到比先前的工作更广泛的公平约束。我们还展示了如何改变现有的分层聚类以保证在层次结构的任何级别上的公平性和簇平衡。",
