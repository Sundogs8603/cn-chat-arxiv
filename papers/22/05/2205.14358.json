    "abstract": "Numerous algorithms have been produced for the fundamental problem of clustering under many different notions of fairness. Perhaps the most common family of notions currently studied is group fairness, in which proportional group representation is ensured in every cluster. We extend this direction by considering the downstream application of clustering and how group fairness should be ensured for such a setting. Specifically, we consider a common setting in which a decision-maker runs a clustering algorithm, inspects the center of each cluster, and decides an appropriate outcome (label) for its corresponding cluster. In hiring for example, there could be two outcomes, positive (hire) or negative (reject), and each cluster would be assigned one of these two outcomes. To ensure group fairness in such a setting, we would desire proportional group representation in every label but not necessarily in every cluster as is done in group fair clustering. We provide algorithms for such problems ",

    "translated_abstract": "针对聚类中的公平性问题，已经出现了许多基于不同公平性概念的算法。目前最常见的公平概念是团体公平性，即每个聚类中都要保证团体比例的合理性。本文在这个方向上进行了扩展，考虑了聚类任务的下游应用以及在该应用中如何实现团体公平性。我们具体研究了一种常见情况，即决策者运行聚类算法，检查每个聚类的中心并为相应的聚类确定一个适当的结果（标签），例如招聘中的“录用”或“拒绝”。在这种情况下，为了确保团体公平性，我们希望每个标签都有符合比例的团体代表，但不一定要求每个聚类都具有两个团体的平衡性。我们提出了解决此类问题的算法。",
