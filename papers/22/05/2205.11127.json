    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统可以极大地影响我们在线上看到的信息，例如在社交媒体上，从而影响我们的信仰、决策和行动。同时，这些系统可以为不同的利益相关者创造巨大的商业价值。鉴于这种基于人工智能的系统对个人、组织和社会的潜在影响越来越大，公平性问题在近年来得到了越来越多的关注。然而，推荐系统公平性的研究仍然是一个正在发展的领域。在本次调查中，我们首先回顾了近年来在该领域提出的公平性基本概念和观念。随后，通过对160多篇学术出版物的综述，我们总结了这一领域目前的研究现状，例如一般研究方法、公平性措施和算法方法。总的来说，我们对最近研究的分析指出了某些研究空白。特别是，我们发现在许多研究中，对提出的模型的公平性提升属性缺乏实质性的评估。此外，该调查还强调了一些有前途的未来方向，例如需要超越统计平衡的新公平性衡量方法。",
