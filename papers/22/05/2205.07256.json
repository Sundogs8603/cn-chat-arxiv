    "translated_abstract": "我们将市场交易价值和交易量的随机性视为资产价格随机性的起源。我们定义了依赖于市场交易价值和交易量的统计矩的前四个市场基于价格的统计矩。如果在时间平均间隔内所有交易量都保持恒定，那么市场基于价格的统计矩与传统基于频率的统计矩相一致。我们通过有限数量的价格统计矩来近似市场基于价格的概率。我们考虑基于市场价格统计矩在资产定价模型和风险价值方面的影响。我们证明了使用交易量加权平均价格会导致价格和交易量的相关性为零。我们推导了基于市场的价格和交易量平方之间的相关性以及价格平方和交易量之间的相关性。要预测期限为T的基于市场的价格波动性，需要预测市场交易价值和交易量的前两个统计矩。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文探讨了市场交易价值和交易量的随机性如何影响资产价格的随机性，并通过市场基于价格的统计矩来近似价格概率。研究发现使用交易量加权平均价格可以消除价格和交易量之间的相关性，并推导出了其他价格和交易量相关性。研究结果对资产定价模型和风险价值有重要影响。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates how the randomness of market trade values and volumes affect the stochasticity of asset prices and approximates price probability using market-based statistical moments. The study finds that using volume-weighted average price eliminates price-volume correlations and derives other correlations between price and volume. The results have important implications for asset pricing models and Value-at-Risk."
