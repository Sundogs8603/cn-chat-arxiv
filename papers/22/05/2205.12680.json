    "translated_abstract": "最近，密集检索的发展依赖于预训练的查询和上下文编码器提供的质量表示查询和上下文。本文介绍了TOUR（Test-Time Optimization of Query Representations），它通过来自测试时间检索结果的信号进一步优化基于实例级别的查询表示。我们利用交叉编码器再排序器来为检索结果提供细粒度的伪标签，并通过梯度下降迭代地优化查询表示。我们的理论分析表明，TOUR可以看作是伪相关反馈的经典Rocchio算法的一种推广，并提出了两种利用伪标签作为硬二进制或软连续标签的变体。我们首先将TOUR应用于短语检索，并使用我们提出的短语再排序器评估其在通道检索上的有效性。TOUR极大地提高了端到端开放领域问答的准确性。",
