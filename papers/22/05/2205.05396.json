    "translated_abstract": "如今，在许多实际应用领域中，通过图形建模的复杂现象的分析在决策方面起着关键作用，这些决策可能会对社会产生重大影响。然而，近年来许多研究和论文揭示了机器学习模型可能导致个体之间存在潜在的差异对待和不公平的结果。在这种情况下，图挖掘的算法贡献也无法摆脱公平性问题，且存在一些与图的固有性质相关的具体挑战：(1) 图数据并非独立同分布，这种假设可能会使许多现有的公平机器学习研究变得无效，(2) 针对关系数据评估不同类型公平性的度量定义，以及(3) 在模型准确性和公平性之间找到良好平衡的算法挑战。本调查是第一个专门关于关系数据公平性的调查。它旨在呈现一个全面的",
