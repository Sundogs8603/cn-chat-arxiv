    "abstract": "For problems requiring cooperation, many multiagent systems implement solutions among either individual agents or across an entire population towards a common goal. Multiagent teams are primarily studied when in conflict; however, organizational psychology (OP) highlights the benefits of teams among human populations for learning how to coordinate and cooperate. In this paper, we propose a new model of multiagent teams for reinforcement learning (RL) agents inspired by OP and early work on teams in artificial intelligence. We validate our model using complex social dilemmas that are popular in recent multiagent RL and find that agents divided into teams develop cooperative pro-social policies despite incentives to not cooperate. Furthermore, agents are better able to coordinate and learn emergent roles within their teams and achieve higher rewards compared to when the interests of all agents are aligned.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于需要合作的问题，许多多智能体系统实施解决方案，既可以是个体智能体之间，也可以是整个人口之间，以达到共同目标。多智能体团队主要在冲突时进行研究；然而，组织心理学（OP）强调团队在人口中的合作和协调学习上的益处。在本文中，我们提出了一种受OP和人工智能中关于团队的早期工作启发的强化学习（RL）智能体的新模型。我们使用近期多智能体RL中流行的复杂社交困境验证我们的模型，并发现即使有不合作的激励，分成团队的智能体仍然能够发展出合作和互助的政策。此外，智能体能够更好地协调和学习团队内的新兴角色，并获得比所有智能体利益一致时更高的奖励。",
