    "translated_abstract": "影响估计分析了对训练数据的更改如何导致不同的模型预测；这种分析可以帮助我们更好地理解这些预测、做出这些预测的模型以及它们训练的数据集。然而，大多数影响估计技术都是为具有连续参数的深度学习模型设计的。梯度提升决策树（GBDT）是一种强大且广泛使用的模型类别；然而，这些模型是黑盒子，具有不透明的决策过程。为了更好地理解 GBDT 预测并普遍改进这些模型，我们将最近和流行的深度学习模型的影响估计方法适应到了 GBDT 上。具体而言，我们使用 representer-point 方法和 TracIn 方法改编了这些方法，分别命名为 TREX 和 BoostIn；源代码可在 https://github.com/jjbrophy47/tree_influence 上找到。我们使用五种不同的评估方法将这些方法与 LeafInfluence 和其他基准线进行了比较。",
