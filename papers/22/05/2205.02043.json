    "translated_abstract": "两样本检验是一种重要的方法，旨在确定两个观测集合是否遵循相同的分布。我们提出了一种基于积分概率度量（IPM）的两样本检验，适用于低维流形上支持的高维样本。我们通过样本数$n$和流形内在维度$d$的结构表征了所提出的检验的特性。当给定一个图集时，我们提出了两步检验以识别一般分布之间的差异，其在$n^{-1/\\max\\{d,2\\}}$的顺序中实现了第二类型风险。当未给出图集时，我们提出了H\\\"older IPM检验，适用于具有$(s,\\beta)$‐H\\\"older密度的数据分布，其在$n^{-(s+\\beta)/d}$的顺序中实现了第二类型风险。为了减轻评估H\\\"older IPM的重计算负担，我们使用神经网络来逼近H\\\"older函数类。基于神经网络的逼近理论，我们可以证明所提出的神经网络H\\\"older IPM测试具有一致的效率。实验结果表明，我们的提出的方法在统计功率方面优于最先进的方法。",
