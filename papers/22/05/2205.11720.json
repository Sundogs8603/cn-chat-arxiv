We describe ENS-t-SNE: an algorithm for Embedding Neighborhoods Simultaneously that generalizes the t-Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding approach. By using different viewpoints in ENS-t-SNE's 3D embedding, one can visualize different types of clusters within the same high-dimensional dataset. This enables the viewer to see and keep track of the different types of clusters, which is harder to do when providing multiple 2D embeddings, where corresponding points cannot be easily identified. We illustrate the utility of ENS-t-SNE with real-world applications and provide an extensive quantitative evaluation with datasets of different types and sizes.",

    "translated_abstract": "当可视化高维数据集时，通常会采用降维技术，提供数据的单一二维视图。我们描述了ENS-t-SNE：一种用于同时嵌入邻域的算法，它推广了t-随机邻域嵌入方法。通过在ENS-t-SNE的3D嵌入中使用不同的视角，可以在相同的高维数据集中可视化不同类型的聚类。这使得观察者能够看到并跟踪不同类型的聚类，而当提供多个2D嵌入时，难以识别对应点。我们通过真实应用程序展示了ENS-t-SNE的效用，并使用不同类型和大小的数据集进行了广泛的定量评估。",
