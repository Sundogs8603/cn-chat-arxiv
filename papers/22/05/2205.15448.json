    "translated_abstract": "最近，视觉transformer在2D人体姿态估计、3D人体姿态估计和人体网格重建任务中取得了巨大的成功。在这些任务中，人体结构信息的特征映射表示通常首先由 CNN（如 HRNet）从图像中提取，然后通过 transformer 进一步处理以预测 HPE 或 HMR 的热力图。然而，现有的 transformer 架构不能直接处理这些特征图输入，需要对具有位置敏感性的人体结构信息进行不自然的展平。此外，最近的 HPE 和 HMR 方法中，很大一部分性能改进是以越来越高的计算和内存需求为代价的。因此，为了同时解决这些问题，我们提出了 FeatER，一种新颖的 transformer 设计，可以保持人体结构信息的内在结构。",
