    "translated_abstract": "在零售行业（例如，杂货店、服装店、在线零售商），库存管理者必须在短期风险（没有销售商品）和长期风险（过量订货导致产品浪费）之间进行平衡。由于缺乏有关未来客户购买的信息，这个平衡任务尤其困难。在本文中，我们从分布的角度研究了在时间范围内重新填充易腐物品的杂货店库存问题。其目标是在不确定实际消费的情况下，最大化销售同时最小化浪费。由于对食物的需求不断增长以及食物浪费对环境、经济和购买力的影响，这个问题在今天具有极高的相关性。我们将库存重新填充作为一项新的强化学习任务，并在此基础上提出了一种名为“腐败DQN”的新的强化学习算法，利用问题的分布式公式来估算每个动作的预期回报。我们在一个合成的杂货店数据集上验证了我们的方法，并证明了我们的方法优于文献中的几个基准线。",
