    "translated_abstract": "对于医学图像分割的深度学习模型受到输入图像强度变化的影响很大，并且由于主要利用像素强度信息进行推理，缺乏泛化能力。获取足够的训练数据是限制模型应用的另一个挑战。我们提出利用医学图像中器官的解剖形状和位置信息的一致性。我们引入了一个框架，通过全局二进制掩码来利用重复出现的解剖模式进行器官分割。研究了两种情况：1）全局二进制掩码是模型(U-Net)的唯一输入，强制进行器官的定位和形状信息编码进行分割。2）将全局二进制掩码作为附加通道，并用作位置和形状线索以减少训练数据的稀缺性。将两个包含脑部和心脏CT图像及其地面实况的数据集分为(26:10:10)和(12:3:5)进行训练、验证和测试。",
