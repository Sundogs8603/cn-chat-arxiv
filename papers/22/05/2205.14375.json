    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了WaveMix——一种新颖的神经网络结构，既具有资源效率性，又具有通用性和可扩展性。WaveMix网络在多项任务上达到了可比或更好的准确率，包括Cityscapes中的分割和Places-365、五个EMNIST数据集和iNAT-mini中的分类，并建立了新的基准。令人惊奇的是，与先前的最先进技术相比，WaveMix结构所需的参数更少。此外，当控制参数数量时，WaveMix所需的GPU RAM更少，这意味着节省时间、成本和能量。为了实现这些收益，我们在WaveMix块中使用了多级二维离散小波变换（2D-DWT），它具有以下优点:(1)它基于三种强图像先验条件重新组织空间信息——尺度不变性，位移不变性和边缘的稀疏性,(2) i",
