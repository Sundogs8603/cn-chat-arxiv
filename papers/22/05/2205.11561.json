The Economics models do not explain the ``probability matching\" phenomena that are observed in many experimental studies. To address these observations, Bayesian models that do not formally fit into the economic utility maximization framework were introduced. In these models individuals sample from their posteriors in communication. In this work we study the asymptotic behavior of such models on connected networks with repeated communication.

    "translated_abstract": "自1970年代以来，经济学领域一直研究贝叶斯群体学习模型，最近在计算语言学方面也进行了研究。经济学模型假设代理人在沟通和行动中最大化效用。然而，这些经济学模型无法解释在许多实验研究中观察到的 \"概率匹配\" 现象。为了解决这些观察结果，引入了一些不完全符合经济学效用最大化框架的贝叶斯模型。在这些模型中，个体在沟通中从其后验分布中进行抽样。本研究探讨了这种模型在连通网络上进行重复沟通时的渐近行为。令人惊讶的是，尽管个体代理人在经典意义上并不是效用最大化者，但我们证明他们最终会达成一致，并且进一步证明极限后验分布是贝叶斯最优的。",
