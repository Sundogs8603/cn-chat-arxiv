    "translated_abstract": "现代车辆依赖于通过控制器局域网络(CAN)总线连接的一系列电子控制单元(ECU)进行关键性车辆控制。随着汽车中先进连接功能的扩展以及内部系统曝光风险的提高，CAN总线越来越容易受到入侵和注入攻击。普通的注入攻击会破坏CAN数据流的典型时序特性，基于规则的入侵检测系统(IDS)可以轻松检测到它们。然而，高级攻击者可以向信号/语义级别注入虚假数据，同时通过CAN消息的模式/频率呈现出看似无害的形式。基于规则和基于异常的IDS仅仅建立在CAN消息ID序列或仅二进制负载数据上，在检测此类攻击方面效果较差。因此，为了检测此类智能攻击，我们提出了CANShield，一种基于深度学习的信号级别入侵检测框架，用于CAN总线。",
