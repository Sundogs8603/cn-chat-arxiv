    "translated_abstract": "对于基础研究和许多前沿应用来说，量子系统中存在的纠缠程度的量化是非常重要的。目前，实现这一目标要么需要对系统具有先验知识，要么需要非常苛刻的实验过程，例如全态测量或集体测量。在这里，我们展示了通过使用神经网络，我们可以在不需要知道量子态的完全描述的情况下量化纠缠程度。我们的方法允许使用不完全的局部测量集对量子相关性进行直接量化。尽管使用了欠采样测量，我们实现了一个比最先进的量子态测量低一个量级的量化误差。此外，我们通过仅使用模拟数据训练的网络实现了这个结果。最后，我们推导出了基于卷积网络输入的方法，该方法可以接受来自各种测量场景的数据。",
