    "translated_abstract": "目标：提出一种新型的基于深度学习的头骨剥离算法，该算法可以直接在信息丰富的k空间中工作。方法：使用来自不同机构的两个数据集共计36,900个MRI切片，我们训练了一个基于深度学习的模型，直接处理复杂的原始k空间数据。在图像域中使用HD-BET（脑提取工具）进行的头骨剥离被用作金标准。结果：两个数据集与金标准非常相似（DICE分数为92\\%-98\\%，Hausdorff距离低于5.5毫米）。眼部以上切片的DICE分数达到了99\\%，而眼部周围和下方的准确性下降，输出部分模糊。k-strip的输出通常在与头骨之间的分界处平滑边缘。使用适当的阈值创建二进制掩模。结论：通过这个概念验证研究，我们能够展示在k空间中工作的可行性。",
