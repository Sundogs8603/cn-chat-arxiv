    "abstract": "We study single-machine scheduling of jobs, each belonging to a job type that determines its duration distribution. We start by analyzing the scenario where the type characteristics are known and then move to two learning scenarios where the types are unknown: non-preemptive problems, where each started job must be completed before moving to another job; and preemptive problems, where job execution can be paused in the favor of moving to a different job. In both cases, we design algorithms that achieve sublinear excess cost, compared to the performance with known types, and prove lower bounds for the non-preemptive case. Notably, we demonstrate, both theoretically and through simulations, how preemptive algorithms can greatly outperform non-preemptive ones when the durations of different job types are far from one another, a phenomenon that does not occur when the type durations are known.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了单机作业调度，每个作业都属于决定其持续时间分布的作业类型。我们首先分析了类型特征已知的情况，然后转向两种学习情景，其中类型未知：非抢占式问题，它要求完成已启动的作业，然后才能移动到另一个作业；和抢占式问题，这里作业执行可以暂停以优先转移到另一个作业。在两种情况下，我们设计的算法相对于已知类型的性能实现了次线性的过剩成本，并证明了非抢占式情况的下限。值得注意的是，我们展示了抢占算法在不同作业类型持续时间相差很大时，理论上和通过模拟的方式可以优于非抢占匹配，在类型持续时间已知时并不存在这种现象。",
