    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一种新的置换检验方法，用于线性模型中系数的子向量推断。当自变量和误差项独立时，该检验方法是精确的。接着，我们证明在两个主要条件下，当独立条件得到放松时，该检验方法在渐进意义下具有正确的水平、一致性和对局部替代方法的功率。第一个条件是通常的自变量和误差项之间缺乏相关性的略微强化。第二个条件是，由不涉及子向量检验的自变量值定义的分层数目相对于样本量很小。这意味着干扰自变量向量是离散的。模拟和实证说明，如果的确有少量的分层相对于样本量而言，该检验方法在实践中具有良好的功效。",

The method is shown to be effective in practice if there are only a few strata coimpared to the sample size."
