    "translated_abstract": "候选检索是推荐系统中的第一阶段，它使用轻量级系统来检索与用户输入相关的潜在商品。这些候选商品随后会使用更复杂的排名模型在推荐系统的后续阶段进行排名和修剪。作为推荐漏斗的顶部，检索到一个高回忆的候选集合以输入到下游的排名模型非常重要。常见的方法是利用来自单个密集查询嵌入的近似最近邻搜索（ANN）; 然而，这种方法可能会产生具有许多近似重复项的低多样性结果集。由于用户通常具有多个兴趣，候选检索理想情况下应返回一个反映用户多个兴趣的多样的候选集合。为了实现这一目标，我们引入了kNN-Embed，一种改善密集ANN检索多样性的通用方法。kNN-Embed将每个用户表示为平滑混合的学习项目聚类，代表不同的兴趣。",
