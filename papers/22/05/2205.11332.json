    "translated_abstract": "图形对比学习（GCL）由于其在无标签节点/图形表示学习方面的超凡性能而受到了极大关注。 然而，在实践中，给定图形的未标记节点的潜在类别分布通常是不平衡的。这种高度不平衡的分类分布不可避免地降低了GCL中学习到的节点表示的质量。 实际上，我们在实验中发现，大多数最先进的GCL方法无法获得有区别的表示，并在不平衡节点分类中表现出差劲的性能。受此观察的启发，我们提出了一种基于不平衡节点分类的正式GCL框架（ImGCL），该框架可以自动和自适应地平衡从GCL中学到的表示，即使在高度不平衡的情况下也能够有效地学习区分表示，并实现与先进技术相当的性能。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一种名为\"ImGCL\"的图形对比学习（GCL）算法框架，该框架能够自动自适应地平衡不平衡节点分类问题中从无标签节点（图）中学到的表示，通过整合在线聚类和逐步平衡采样方法，我们的算法可以有效地学习区分表示，实现与先进技术相当的性能。",
