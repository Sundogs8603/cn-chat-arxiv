    "translated_abstract": "从日常讨论到营销广告再到政治言论，信息操作无处不在。因此，拥有一套正确的工具来抵御操纵性言辞或谬误变得越来越重要。现有的自动识别谬误的技术在自然语言处理研究中正在被探索。然而，一个上下文中的谬误在另一个上下文中可能不是谬误，因此有必要解释它被判断为谬误的方式和原因。为了可解释的谬误识别，我们提出了一种通过形式约束来表征谬误的新方法，作为传统谬误分类的可行替代方法。为了实现这一目标，我们引入了一种新颖的上下文感知论证模型，即主题-方面-论证模型，它可以实现两个功能：对给定的论证进行建模（修辞建模）以及更深入的语义分析。",

The model is capable of both rhetorical modeling and deep semantic analysis."
