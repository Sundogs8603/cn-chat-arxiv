    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）是一种有前途的方法，用于学习和预测边界值问题中描述的物理现象，例如带有边界条件的偏微分方程（PDE）。然而，现有的模型不足以充分考虑边界条件，从而无法可靠地预测此类问题。此外，由于GNN的局部连接性质，准确预测长时间后的状态，其中顶点之间的相互作用往往是全局的，是困难的。我们提出了一种称为物理嵌入神经网络的方法，考虑边界条件，并使用隐式方法预测长时间后的状态。它基于E（n）-等变GNN构建，因此在各种形状上具有高度的泛化性能。我们证明，我们的模型学习了复杂形状中的流动现象，并在速度-精度权衡方面优于经过良好优化的经典求解器和最先进的机器学习模型。因此，我们的模型为使用混合边界条件描述的PDE边界值问题提供了有前途的解决方案。",
