    "abstract": "We study contextual linear bandit problems under feature uncertainty; they are noisy with missing entries. To address the challenges of the noise, we analyze Bayesian oracles given observed noisy features. Our Bayesian analysis finds that the optimal hypothesis can be far from the underlying realizability function, depending on the noise characteristics, which are highly non-intuitive and do not occur for classical noiseless setups. This implies that classical approaches cannot guarantee a non-trivial regret bound. Therefore, we propose an algorithm that aims at the Bayesian oracle from observed information under this model, achieving $\\tilde{O}(d\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when there is a large number of arms. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm using synthetic and real-world datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了带有噪声和缺失项的上下文线性Bandit问题。为了解决噪声的挑战，我们分析了在观测噪声特征的情况下给出的贝叶斯神谕。我们的贝叶斯分析发现，最优假设可能会远离潜在的可实现函数，这取决于噪声特征，这是高度非直观的，并且在经典的无噪声设置下不会发生。这意味着经典方法不能保证非平凡的遗憾界（regret bound）。因此，我们提出了一个算法，旨在从这个模型下的观察信息中实现贝叶斯神谕，当有大量手臂时，可以实现$\\tilde{O}(d\\sqrt{T})$遗憾界。我们使用合成和实际数据集演示了所提出的算法。",
