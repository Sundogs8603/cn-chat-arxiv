Our framework extends classic R-decompositions used in kernel methods, enabling nested part-of-part relations. Unlike recursive neural networks, which unroll a template on input graphs directly, we unroll a neural network template over the decomposition hierarchy, allowing us to deal with the high degree variability that typically characterize social network graphs. Deep hierarchical decompositions are also amenable to domain compression, a technique that reduces both space and time complexity by exploiting symmetries. We show empirically that our approach is able to outperform current state-of-the-art graph classification methods on large social network datasets, while at the same time being competitive on small chemobiological benchmark datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种基于深层分层分解的架构，用于学习大型图的有效表示。我们的框架扩展了在核方法中使用的经典R-分解，实现了嵌套的部分-部分关系。与直接在输入图上展开模板的递归神经网络不同，我们在分解层次结构上展开神经网络模板，从而能够处理通常表征社交网络图的高度变化。深层次的分层分解也适用于领域压缩，这种技术通过利用对称性来减少空间和时间复杂度。我们在实证上证明，我们的方法在大型社交网络数据集上能够胜过当前最先进的图分类方法，同时在小型化学生物基准数据集上具有竞争力。",
