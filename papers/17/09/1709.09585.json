    "translated_abstract": "预测交通状况最近被探索作为缓解交通拥堵的一种方式。一些开创性的方法已经提出，基于目标位置及其相邻区域的交通观察，但由于缺乏道路拓扑的挖掘，它们的准确性有所限制。为了解决效果衰减问题，我们建议考虑周围位置（比邻接范围更广）的交通情况。我们提出了一种端到端的框架，称为DeepTransport，其中利用卷积神经网络（CNN）和循环神经网络（RNN）获取交通网络拓扑内的时空交通信息。此外，引入了注意力机制来对齐时空信息。此外，我们构建并发布了一个真实世界的大型交通状况数据集，分辨率为5分钟。我们对该数据集的实验表明，我们的方法捕捉到了时空关系的复杂性。",
