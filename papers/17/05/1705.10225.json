We focus on nonparametric formulations that allow their inference in a manner that prevents overfitting, and enables model selection. We discuss aspects of the choice of priors, in particular how to avoid underfitting via increased Bayesian hierarchies, and we contrast the task of sampling network partitions from the posterior distribution with finding the single point estimate that maximizes it, while describing efficient algorithms to perform either one. We also show how inferring the SBM can be used to predict missing and spurious links, and shed light on the fundamental limitations of the detectability of modular structures in networks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本章节提供了一个自包含的介绍，教授如何使用贝叶斯推断从网络数据中提取大规模模块结构，基于随机块模型(SBM)，以及其校正度量和重叠推广。我们着重于非参数的表述，允许它们在有效防止过拟合和实现模型选择的情况下推断。我们讨论了先验选择的方面，特别是如何通过增加贝叶斯层次结构避免欠拟合，并对比了从后验分布中采样网络分区和寻找最大化后验分布的单个点估计之间的任务，同时描述了执行任何一个任务的高效算法。我们还展示了如何利用推断SBM来预测缺失和虚假链接，并揭示了网络中模块化结构的可检测性的基本限制。",
