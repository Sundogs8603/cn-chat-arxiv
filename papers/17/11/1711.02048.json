    "abstract": "I propose a treatment selection model that introduces unobserved heterogeneity in both choice sets and preferences to evaluate the average effects of a program offer. I show how to exploit the model structure to define parameters capturing these effects and then computationally characterize their identified sets under instrumental variable variation in choice sets. I illustrate these tools by analyzing the effects of providing an offer to the Head Start preschool program using data from the Head Start Impact Study. I find that such a policy affects a large number of children who take up the offer, and that they subsequently have positive effects on test scores. These effects arise from children who do not have any preschool as an outside option. A cost-benefit analysis reveals that the earning benefits associated with the test score gains can be large and outweigh the net costs associated with offer take up.",

    "translated_abstract": "我提出了一个治疗选择模型，引入了选择集和偏好中的未观测异质性，以评估方案提供的平均效果。我展示了如何利用模型结构来定义捕捉这些效果的参数，然后在选择集的工具变异下计算其识别集。我通过使用Head Start Impact Study的数据分析提供Head Start学前计划的效果来说明这些工具。我发现这样的政策影响了许多接受方案的孩子，并且随后对考试成绩产生了积极的影响。这些效果来自那些没有学前教育作为选择的选项的孩子。成本效益分析显示，与考试成绩增长相关的收入效益可以很大，超过了接受方案所带来的净成本。",
