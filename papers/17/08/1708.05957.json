    "translated_abstract": "首先引入了$\\mathscr{Y}^{g,\\xi}$-次亚麻系统的概念，其中非线性算子$\\mathscr{Y}^{g,\\xi}$对应于具有$g$生成函数和下面界$\\xi$ 的反射BSDE解的第一部分。然后我们首先证明了，在左有限右连续障碍物的情况下，任何$\\mathscr{Y}^{g,\\xi}$-次亚麻系统都可以通过一个右下半连续的过程聚合。接着，我们证明了一种“Mertens分解”的方法，该方法不使用标准的罚款技术。这些结果对于处理控制/停止博弈问题特别有用，并且据我们所知，它们在文献中是全新的。作为一个应用，我们引入了一类新的“弱停时条件下反向随机微分方程（简称BSDE）”，与美式期权的部分对冲相关。我们研究了这种BSDE的良态性。",
