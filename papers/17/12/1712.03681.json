    "abstract": "The goal of this paper is to review some analytic techniques that are potentially useful to shed light on the determinacy question that arises in New Keynesian models as result of a combination of several monetary policy rules; in these models, we provide conditions to guarantee existence and uniqueness of equilibrium by means of results that are obtained from theoretical analysis. In particular, these methods confirm the well known fact that Taylor--like rules in interest rate setting are not the only way to reach determinacy of the rational expectations equilibrium in the New Keynesian setting. The key technical tool we use for that purposes is the so--called Budan--Fourier Theorem, that we review along the paper. All the ideas and techniques presented have been already used, our contribution that might be original here are the organization and emphasis.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文的目标是回顾一些分析技术，以揭示在新凯恩斯模型中由于多个货币政策规则的组合而产生的决定性问题。在这些模型中，我们通过理论分析得出了保证均衡存在和唯一性的条件。特别地，这些方法证实了已知的事实，即在新凯恩斯设置中，像Taylor规则那样的利率设定并不是实现合理预期均衡决定性的唯一途径。我们在本文中回顾了用于此目的的关键技术工具——布丹-傅里叶定理。我们介绍的所有想法和技术都已经被使用过，我们在这里可能的原创贡献是组织和强调。",
