    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种策略，用于在随机实验中估算和推断异质性效应的关键特征。这些关键特征包括使用机器学习代理的效应的最佳线性预测器，按影响组排序的平均效应以及最受影响单位的平均特征和最不受影响的单位。该方法在高维设置中有效，其中效应由预测和因果机器学习方法进行代理（但不一定是一致估计的）。我们将这些代理后处理成关键特征的估计值。我们的方法是通用的，可以与有惩罚的方法，神经网络，随机森林，提升树和集成方法一起使用，既可以进行预测也可以进行因果分析。估计和推断基于重复数据分割，以避免过度拟合并实现有效性。我们使用结果的分位聚合来自许多潜在的分割，特别是取p值的中位数和置信区间的中位数和其他分位数。我们将该方法应用于印度一项大型免疫计划的数据中，估计免疫对儿童发病率和死亡率的影响。我们的结果表明，我们的方法在高维度，异质性处理设置中产生有效的推断。",
