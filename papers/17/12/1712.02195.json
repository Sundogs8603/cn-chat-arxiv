We provide accurate approximations that make it possible to numerically calculate these quantities in the homogeneous case. Simulation studies indicate good performance when compared to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and at a tiny fraction of the time taken by those stochastic approaches. The value of our approximations is illustrated in performing Bayesian inference in a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging activation detection experiment, and also in likelihood ratio testing for anisotropy in the spatial patterns of yearly increases in pistachio tree yields.",

    "translated_abstract": "Ising 模型在许多应用中都很重要，但其归一化常数、活动顶点数的平均值和自旋相互作用的均值难以计算。我们提供了准确的近似值，使得在同质情况下可以数值计算这些量。模拟研究表明，与马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法相比，我们的方法性能良好，且所需时间只是那些随机方法的一小部分。我们的近似值在执行功能磁共振激活检测实验的贝叶斯推断以及植物生产中年增量空间图案的各向异性的似然比检验中得到了体现。",
