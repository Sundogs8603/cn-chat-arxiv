    "translated_abstract": "宏观管理是星际争霸中一个重要的问题，长期以来一直受到研究。在过去几年中，各种数据集和不同的方法已被提出，但这些数据集存在一些缺陷，难以提升学术和工业研究的效果：1）某些数据集中缺乏标准的预处理、解析和特征提取程序以及预定义的训练、验证和测试集；2）一些数据集仅针对宏观管理中的特定任务；3）一些数据集要么太小，要么没有足够的标记数据，难以使用现代机器学习算法进行训练，如深度神经网络。因此，大多数先前的方法是基于各种特征进行训练，通过在不同的测试集上进行评估，难以直接进行比较。为了提升星际争霸宏观管理的研究，我们基于SC2LE平台发布了一个新的数据集MSC。MSC由精心设计的特征向量和预定义的高级样本组成，能够为研究者提供更好的数据支持。",
    "tldr": "该研究提供了一个新的加强版星际争霸数据集MSC，该数据集解决了其他数据集存在的缺陷，为研究者提供了更好的数据支持。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study provides a new and improved dataset called MSC for macro-management research in StarCraft II. The dataset addresses the limitations of previous datasets and provides better data support for researchers."
