    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的技术，称为“模拟器”，用于分析自适应采样。我们的方法与现有方法不同，它不考虑任何固定采样策略可以收集多少信息，而是考虑在给定的有限数据收集时间内，区分好的采样策略和坏的采样策略有多难。这种视角的改变使我们能够匹配Fano和变量测量技术的优点，而不会陷入任何一种方法的局限性中。为了具体说明，我们将我们的技术应用到了一个固定置信水平的纯探索场景中的结构化多臂赌博问题，我们展示了在均值限制下，有中等置信度的样本复杂度和文献中在 $\\delta \\to 0$ 时得到的渐近复杂度之间存在着实质性差异。我们还证明了作为顶部-k问题的第一个基于实例的下界，其包括适当的对数因子。",
