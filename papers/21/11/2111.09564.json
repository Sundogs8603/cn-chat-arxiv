    "translated_abstract": "计算机系统中生成的系统日志指的是大规模同时收集的数据，用作确定错误、入侵和异常行为的基础数据。系统日志异常检测的目标是及时识别异常，同时最小化人工干预，这是行业中的一个关键问题。先前的研究通过将各种形式的日志数据转换为标准化模板，使用解析器进行算法进行异常检测。特别是，应预先定义与特定事件对应的模板，以便所有日志数据使用该模板，其中日志关键信息可能会丢失。在本研究中，我们提出了一种名为LAnoBERT的无解析器系统日志异常检测方法，该方法使用了BERT模型，具有出色的自然语言处理性能。所提出的方法LAnoBERT通过掩码语言建模进行模型学习，进而进行无监督的异常检测。",
