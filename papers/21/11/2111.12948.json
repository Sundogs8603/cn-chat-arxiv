    "abstract": "Difference in differences (DD) is widely used to find policy/treatment effects with observational data, but applying DD to limited dependent variables (LDV's) Y has been problematic. This paper addresses how to apply DD and related approaches (such as \"ratio in ratios\" or \"ratio in odds ratios\") to binary, count, fractional, multinomial or zero-censored Y under the unifying framework of `generalized linear models with link functions'. We evaluate DD and the related approaches with simulation and empirical studies, and recommend 'Poisson Quasi-MLE' for non-negative (such as count or zero-censored) Y and (multinomial) logit MLE for binary, fractional or multinomial Y.",
