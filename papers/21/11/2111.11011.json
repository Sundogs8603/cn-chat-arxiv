    "translated_abstract": "基于Transformer的编码-解码框架在场景文本识别中越来越流行，主要是因为它能够自然地整合来自视觉和语义领域的识别线索。然而，最近的研究表明这两种线索并不总是很好地注册，因此在困难文本（例如，具有罕见形状的文本）中，特征和字符可能不对齐。因此，引入了字符位置等约束来缓解这个问题。尽管在一定程度上取得了成功，但视觉和语义仍然是分别建模的，它们之间只是松散关联。在本文中，我们提出了一个新颖的模块，称为多域字符距离感知（MDCDP），用于建立一个视觉上和语义上相关的位置嵌入。MDCDP使用位置嵌入通过交叉注意机制查询视觉和语义特征。这两种线索被融合到位置分支中，生成一个能够很好地感知字符的内容感知嵌入。",
