    "translated_abstract": "磁性材料是许多可推动生态过渡的技术的关键组成部分，包括电动机，风力发电机和磁性制冷系统。因此，发现具有大磁矩的材料成为了日益重要的任务。本文采用最先进的机器学习方法，扫描数十万个现有材料的无机晶体结构数据库（ICSD），以找到具有铁磁性和大磁矩的材料。采用材料计划数据库上的晶体图卷积神经网络（CGCNN），材料图网络（MEGNet）和随机森林进行训练，该数据库包含高通量DFT预测结果。对于随机森林，我们使用基于化学成分和晶体结构的近100个描述符来选择相关属性。这给出的结果与神经网络的结果相当。这些不同机器学习方法之间的比较表明，它们可以高精度地预测具有大磁矩的材料。我们的研究结果为使用现有材料设计高性能磁铁以及发现具有大磁矩的新化合物开辟了新的途径。",
