We investigate this estimand under the assumption that the instruments shift compliers from no treatment to some but not from some treatment to more. We show that when there are extensive margin compliers only (EMCO) this estimand captures a weighted average of treatment effects that can be partially unbundled into each complier group's potential outcome means.

    "translated_abstract": "在使用工具变量研究有序治疗的研究中，常常将治疗重新编码为任何暴露的指示变量。我们在假设仪器将从无治疗转移到一些治疗中的从者，但不会从一些治疗转移到更多治疗的情况下，研究了该估计量。我们发现，当只存在广泛边际的从者时，该估计量捕捉了治疗效应的加权平均值，并且可以从各个从者群体的潜在结果均值中部分解开。我们还建立了广泛边际从者和二因素选择模型之间的等价性，并将我们的结果应用于研究俄勒冈州健康保险实验中的治疗异质性。",

The findings show that this method, applied when there are extensive margin compliers, captures a weighted average of treatment effects and allows for disaggregation of potential outcome means by each complier group. The study also establishes the equivalence between extensive margin compliers and a two-factor selection model, and applies the results to studying treatment heterogeneity in the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment."
