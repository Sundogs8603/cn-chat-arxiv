    "translated_abstract": "在众包中，通过让工人检查项目并对其正确性进行投票，可以实现质量控制。为了最小化不可靠工人响应的影响，采用了一个$\\delta$-边界投票过程，直到超过了工人之间达成一致的预定阈值$\\delta$为止，额外的投票将被征求意见。该过程被广泛采用，但仅作为一种经验法则。我们的研究提出了一种利用吸收式马尔可夫链来分析在众包过程中与这种投票过程相关的特征的建模方法。我们提供了一种闭式方程，用于描述所得出的共识投票的质量、达成共识所需的平均投票数、投票需求的方差和其他分布矩。我们的研究结果表明，可以调整阈值$\\delta$以实现在使用具有不同准确性水平的工人的投票过程中的质量等效。我们还提供了与投票过程效率相等的支付费率。",
