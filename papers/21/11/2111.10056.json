    "translated_abstract": "医学视觉问答（VQA）是医学人工智能和流行VQA挑战相结合的一种方法。给定一张医学图像和一个自然语言相关的临床问题，医学VQA系统应该预测一个合理且有说服力的答案。虽然广泛研究了一般领域的VQA，但由于其任务特性，医学VQA仍需要具有特定的调查和探索。在本综述的第一部分中，我们汇总并讨论了迄今为止公开可用的医学VQA数据集，包括数据源、数据数量和任务特征。在第二部分中，我们回顾了用于医学VQA任务的方法。我们总结并讨论了它们的技术、创新和潜在改进。在最后一部分中，我们分析了该领域中的一些医学特定挑战，并讨论了未来的研究方向。我们的目标是为对医学视觉问答领域感兴趣的研究人员提供全面有用的信息。",
