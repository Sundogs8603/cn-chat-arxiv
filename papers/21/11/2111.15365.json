    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms dedicated to financial time series forecasting have gained a lot of interest. But choosing between several algorithms can be challenging, as their estimation accuracy may be unstable over time. Online aggregation of experts combine the forecasts of a finite set of models in a single approach without making any assumption about the models. In this paper, a Bernstein Online Aggregation (BOA) procedure is applied to the construction of long-short strategies built from individual stock return forecasts coming from different machine learning models. The online mixture of experts leads to attractive portfolio performances even in environments characterised by non-stationarity. The aggregation outperforms individual algorithms, offering a higher portfolio Sharpe Ratio, lower shortfall, with a similar turnover. Extensions to expert and aggregation specialisations are also proposed to improve the overall mixture on a family of portfolio evaluation metrics.",

    "translated_abstract": "专注于金融时间序列预测的机器学习算法引起了很多关注。但是，在多个算法之间进行选择可能很具有挑战性，因为它们的估计准确性可能随时间而不稳定。专家在线聚合将有限集合模型的预测结合在一个单一的方法中，而不对模型做任何假设。本文将伯恩斯坦在线聚合（BOA）程序应用于由不同的机器学习模型生成的个股收益预测构建的多空策略的构建中。专家在线聚合在非平稳环境下也能产生有吸引力的投资组合表现。聚合方法胜过单独的算法，在投资组合夏普比率较高、亏损较低，并且换手率相似。还提出了专家和聚合特化的扩展，以改善整体混合在一族投资组合评估指标上的性能。",
