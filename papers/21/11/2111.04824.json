    "translated_abstract": "串联质谱能够捕捉分子的碎片模式，提供关于分子结构的关键信息。尽管质谱法在许多领域中应用，但绝大多数小分子缺乏实验参考谱。七十多年来，谱预测一直是该领域的关键挑战。现有的深度学习方法没有利用分子的全局结构，可能导致难以推广到新数据。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新模型MassFormer，用于准确预测串联质谱。MassFormer使用图变换器架构来模拟分子中原子之间的远距离关系。变形器模块使用化学的预训练任务获得的参数进行初始化，然后在谱数据上进行微调。MassFormer在多组数据集上优于竞争方法，能够恢复关于碰撞能量对光谱的影响的先前知识。",
