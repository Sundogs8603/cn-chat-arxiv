    "translated_abstract": "随机对照试验（RCT）被认为是评估任何干预或治疗效果的黄金标准。然而，由于伦理、经济和法律考虑，其可行性经常受阻，使得观察数据成为绘制因果结论的宝贵替代方法。然而，由于医疗观察数据具有高维性，这带来了困难挑战，需要仔细考虑以确保无偏、可靠和稳健的因果推断。为了克服这一挑战，本研究提出了一种名为Outcome Adaptive Elastic Net（OAENet）的新颖两阶段特征选择技术，专门设计用于使用匹配技术做出稳健的因果推断决策。OAENet相对于现有方法具有几个关键优势：在相关和高维数据上表现优越于现有方法，并具有选择特定变量集的能力。",
