    "translated_abstract": "2019年12月，一种新型病毒，COVID-19已经导致了极多的死亡。与西班牙流感1918年相比，与这种新冠病毒的斗争令人困惑和恐惧。而在前线医生和医学研究人员在控制这种高度传染病毒的传播方面取得了重要进展的同时，技术在这场战斗中也证明了其重要性。此外，人工智能在许多医疗应用中得到了采用，可以诊断许多疾病，甚至使经验丰富的医生感到困惑。因此，本调查论文探讨了提出的方法，可帮助医生和研究人员早期和廉价地诊断该病。大多数发展中国家难以使用传统方式进行测试，但可以采用机器学习和深度学习的方法。另一方面，获得不同类型的医学图像也激发了研究人员的动力。因此，大量的技术创新被引入并应用于实践中。",
