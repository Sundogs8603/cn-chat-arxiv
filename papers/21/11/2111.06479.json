    "translated_abstract": "在许多信号处理问题中，从三次相关谱（也称为 bispectrum）中恢复信号是一项重要的任务。然而传统方法并不能准确地从 bispectrum 反演出底层信号。本文提出了一种方法，能够从至少 $3B$ 个 bispectrum 测量结果（其中 $B$ 是信号的带宽）中唯一地恢复带限信号。我们的方法也适用于时限信号。我们提出了一种两步信赖域算法，通过最小化一个非凸目标函数来进行优化。首先，我们通过谱算法对信号进行近似，然后根据一系列梯度迭代来改进所得到的初始化结果。数值实验表明，我们的算法可以从完整或欠采样的 bispectrum 观测结果中估计带限或时限信号。",
