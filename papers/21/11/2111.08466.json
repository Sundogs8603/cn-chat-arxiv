    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑将布尔规则学习表示为析取范式（DNF，与决策规则集相等）的可解释的分类模型。提出了一个整数规划模型，以最优化分类准确性和规则简单性之间的平衡。同时，考虑了公平性设置，并扩展了模型，包括对两种分类公平性度量的显式约束：机会平等和均衡几率。采用列生成法（CG）高效搜索大量可能规则，而无需启发式规则挖掘。为了处理大规模数据集，提出了一种利用随机化的近似CG算法。与三种最近提出的替代算法相比，在16个数据集中，CG算法在8个数据集上兼顾了准确性和简单性的平衡。当以准确性为最大化目标时，CG算法与专为此目的设计的规则学习器具有相当的竞争力，有时能找到更简单但准确性不减的解决方案。",
