    "translated_abstract": "建筑物的分割是地球观测和航空图像分析领域的基本任务。现有文献中大部分基于深度学习的方法只能应用于固定或狭窄范围的空间分辨率图像。在实际场景中，用户处理的是广泛的图像分辨率范围。因此，给定的航空图像通常需要进行重采样以匹配用于训练深度学习模型的空间分辨率数据集，这导致分割性能的下降。为了克服这一挑战，我们在本文中提出了尺度不变神经网络（Sci-Net）架构，用于从广泛范围的空间分辨率航空图像中分割建筑物。具体而言，我们的方法利用了UNet的层次表示和Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling来提取细粒度的多尺度表示。Sci-Net在Open Cities AI和Multi-Scale Building数据集上明显优于现有模型。",
