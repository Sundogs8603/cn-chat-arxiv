    "abstract": "Precise information is essential for making good policies, especially those regarding reform decisions. However, decision-makers may hesitate to gather such information if certain decisions could have negative impacts on their future careers. We model how decision-makers with career concerns may acquire policy-relevant information and carry out reform decisions when their policy discretion can be limited ex ante. Typically, decision-makers with career concerns have weaker incentives to acquire information compared to decision-makers without such concerns. In this context, we demonstrate that the public can encourage information acquisition by eliminating either the \"moderate policy\" or the status quo from decision-makers' discretion. We also analyze when reform decisions should be strategically delegated to decision-makers with or without career concerns.",

    "translated_abstract": "精确的信息对于制定良好的政策，尤其是涉及改革决策的政策至关重要。然而，决策者可能会犹豫不决地获取这些信息，因为某些决策可能对他们未来的职业生涯产生负面影响。我们模拟了具有职业忧虑的决策者在政策裁量可以在前被限制的情况下，如何获取政策相关信息并进行改革决策。通常情况下，具有职业忧虑的决策者相对于没有此类忧虑的决策者，获取信息的动力较弱。在这种情况下，我们证明公众可以通过在决策者的裁量中消除\"温和政策\"或现状来鼓励信息获取。我们还分析了何时应该将改革决策战略性地委托给具有或没有职业忧虑的决策者。",
