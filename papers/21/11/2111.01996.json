    "translated_abstract": "对抗鲁棒性主要包括基于敏感性的鲁棒性和空间鲁棒性，在实现鲁棒泛化方面起着重要作用。本文旨在设计实现通用对抗鲁棒性的策略。为了实现这一目标，我们首先研究了相对较少探索的空间鲁棒性领域。然后，我们将现有的空间鲁棒性方法整合起来，将局部和全局空间的脆弱性结合到一个统一的空间攻击和对抗训练方法中。此外，我们从鲁棒表示的角度提供了自然准确性、基于敏感性的鲁棒性和空间鲁棒性之间的全面关系，并且提供了强有力的证据支持。关键是，为了将各种鲁棒性组成部分之间的相互影响纳入一个统一的框架中，我们将帕累托准则引入到对抗鲁棒性分析中，提出了一种名为Pareto Adversarial Robustness的新策略。",
