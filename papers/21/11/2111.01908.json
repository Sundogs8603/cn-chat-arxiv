    "abstract": "As a YouTube channel grows, each video can potentially collect enormous amounts of comments that provide direct feedback from the viewers. These comments are a major means of understanding viewer expectations and improving channel engagement. However, the comments only represent a general collection of user opinions about the channel and the content. Many comments are poorly constructed, trivial, and have improper spellings and grammatical errors. As a result, it is a tedious job to identify the comments that best interest the content creators. In this paper, we extract and classify the raw comments into different categories based on both sentiment and sentence types that will help YouTubers find relevant comments for growing their viewership. Existing studies have focused either on sentiment analysis (positive and negative) or classification of sub-types within the same sentence types (e.g., types of questions) on a text corpus. These have limited application on non-traditional text c",

    "translated_abstract": "随着YouTube频道的增长，每个视频都可能收集大量评论，这些评论是理解观众期望和改善频道参与度的主要手段。然而，这些评论只代表用户关于频道和内容的一般观点。许多评论构造较差，琐碎并且存在拼写和语法错误，因此，识别最能吸引内容创作者的评论是一项繁琐的工作。本文旨在通过情感和句子类型将原始评论分类，以帮助YouTuber找到更相关的评论，从而增加其观众群。",
