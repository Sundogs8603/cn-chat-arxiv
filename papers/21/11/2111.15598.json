Globalization can induce substantial power shifts between states, which makes the threat of a preventive trade war salient.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一种在预防性贸易战阴影下进行的两国谈判博弈模型，探讨了在全球化时代为什么国家会有意维持贸易壁垒。全球化可能导致国家之间的实力转移，使得预防性贸易战的威胁显著。在这种情况下，可能存在“健康”的贸易壁垒，通过降低国家从此类战争中预期获得的回报来减缓战争的动因。因此，我们证明了贸易壁垒有时可以作为所需要的制动器和缓冲器，以维持国家之间低效但和平的经济合作。通过研究自1972年以来的美中贸易关系，我们评估了理论上的影响。",

The study evaluated the theoretical implications by examining the US-China trade relations since 1972."
