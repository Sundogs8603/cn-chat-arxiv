    "abstract": "In the literature on simultaneous non-cooperative games, it is a widely used fact that a positive affine (linear) transformation of the utility payoffs neither changes the best response sets nor the Nash equilibrium set. We investigate which other game transformations also possess one of these two properties when being applied to an arbitrary N-player game (N >= 2):  (i) The Nash equilibrium set stays the same.  (ii) The best response sets stay the same.  For game transformations that operate player-wise and strategy-wise, we prove that (i) implies (ii) and that transformations with property (ii) must be positive affine. The resulting equivalence chain gives an explicit description of all those game transformations that always preserve the Nash equilibrium set (or, respectively, the best response sets). Simultaneously, we obtain two new characterizations of the class of positive affine transformations.",

    "translated_abstract": "在同时非合作博弈的文献中，广泛使用的事实是，效用收益的正仿射（线性）变换既不改变最佳反应集，也不改变纳什均衡集。我们研究了哪些其他游戏变换在应用于任意N人游戏（N≥2）时也具有这两种属性之一：（i）纳什均衡集保持不变；（ii）最佳反应集保持不变。对于以玩家和策略为基础的游戏变换，我们证明（i）意味着（ii），具有属性（ii）的变换必须是正仿射的。得到的等价链明确描述了那些总是保持纳什均衡集（或最佳反应集）的游戏变换。同时，我们获得了正仿射变换类的两个新特征描述。",
