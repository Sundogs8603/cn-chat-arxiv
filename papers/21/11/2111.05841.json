    "translated_abstract": "许多物理和工程应用需要传统上用资源密集型的高保真数值求解器计算的偏微分方程属性评估。数据驱动的代理模型提供了一种高效的替代方法，但训练成本很高。新兴应用将获益于具有改进的准确性-成本平衡的代理模型，同时在大规模上进行研究。本文提出了一种\"物理增强的深度代理\"（\"PEDS\"）方法，用于开发复杂物理系统的快速代理模型，该系统由偏微分方程描述。具体而言，提出了低保真度可解释的物理模拟器和神经网络生成器的组合，通过端到端训练全局匹配昂贵高保真数值求解器的输出。在扩散、反应扩散和电磁散射模型的三个示例测试用例上的实验证明，PEDS代理比一个例子加上的。。",
