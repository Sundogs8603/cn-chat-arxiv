    "translated_abstract": "胶囊网络在深度神经网络中定义特征之间的位置关系方面非常强大，但计算复杂且不适合在移动设备上运行。计算复杂度集中在胶囊之间采用的动态路由机制中。另一方面，XNOR-Net虽然快速且计算效率高，但由于二值化过程中的信息损失而导致准确性不高。为了解决动态路由机制的计算负担，本文提出了通过对CapsFC层内或外的线性投影进行XNOR处理的新的全连接（FC）层。具体而言，我们提出的FC层有两个版本，即XnODR（在动态路由之外对线性投影进行XNOR处理）和XnIDR（在动态路由之内对线性投影进行XNOR处理）。为了测试XnODR和XnIDR的泛化能力，我们将它们插入到两个不同的网络中，MobileNetV...",
