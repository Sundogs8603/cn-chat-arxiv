    "translated_abstract": "估计动态治疗效应在各个学科中都是至关重要的，可以提供有关干预的时变因果影响的微妙见解。然而，由于“维数灾难”和时变混杂的存在，这种估计存在着挑战，可能导致估计偏误。此外，正确地规定日益增多的治疗分配和多重暴露的结果模型似乎过于复杂。鉴于这些挑战，双重鲁棒性的概念，在允许模型错误的情况下，是非常有价值的，然而在实际应用中并没有实现。本文通过提出新的鲁棒估计方法来解决这个问题，同时对治疗分配和结果模型进行鲁棒估计。我们提出了一种“序列模型双重鲁棒性”的解决方案，证明了当每个时间暴露都是双重鲁棒性的时，可以在多个时间点上实现双重鲁棒性。这种方法提高了高维环境下动态治疗效应估计的鲁棒性和可靠性。",
