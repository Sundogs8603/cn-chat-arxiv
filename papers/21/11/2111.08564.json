    "abstract": "We propose two classes of doxastic extensions of fuzzy \\L ukasiewicz logic that are sound and complete with respect to some appropriate classes of Kripke-based models in which both atomic propositions and accessibility relations are fuzzy. One class of these extensions is equipped with pseudo-classical belief that has properties similar to the classical belief, and the other class is based on a new notion of belief that we call it \\textit{skeptical} belief. We model a fuzzy version of the muddy children problem using pseudo-classical belief and a CPA-security experiment using skeptical belief, then by showing that the pseudo-classical belief is not appropriate for modeling the belief of an adversary in a CPA-experiment we justify proposing the notion of skeptical belief. Furthermore, we prove the soundness and completeness theorems for some of the proposed doxastic extensions.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了两类关于信念的扩展，它们是模糊\\L ukasiewicz逻辑关于基于Kripke的模型的一些适当类别的声音且完整的。这些扩展的一类带有类似于经典信念的伪古典信念属性，另一类基于一种我们称之为\\textit{skeptical}（怀疑的）信念的新概念。我们使用伪古典信念对模糊版本的“泥泞儿童问题”进行建模，使用怀疑的信念对CPA安全性实验进行建模，然后通过展示伪古典信念不适用于模拟CPA实验中对手的信念，从而证明提出怀疑的信念概念的合理性。此外，我们还证明了一些提出的信念扩展的完整性和声音性定理。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes two classes of doxastic extensions for \\L ukasiewicz logic, based on different belief concepts, and proves their soundness and completeness theorems. One class is modeled using a pseudo-classical belief similar to classical belief, while the other introduces a new notion of skeptical belief. The paper also demonstrates the inadequacy of pseudo-classical belief in modeling the belief of an adversary in a CPA experiment."
