Compatible features enable for direct comparison of old and new learned features, allowing them to be used interchangeably over time. This eliminates the need for visual search systems to extract new features for all previously seen images in the gallery-set when sequentially upgrading the representation model. Extracting new features is typically quite expensive or infeasible in the case of very large gallery-sets and/or real time systems (i.e., face-recognition systems, social networks, life-long learning systems, robotics and surveillance systems). Our approach, called Compatible Representations via Stationarity (CoReS), achieves compatibility by encouraging stationarity to the learned representation model without relying on previously learned models. Stationarity allows features' statistical properties not to change under time shift so ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新方法来学习内部特征表示模型，使其与先前学习的模型“兼容”。兼容特征使旧和新的特征可以直接比较，允许它们在时间上互换使用，从而消除了在逐步升级表示模型时，在图库中提取所有先前看到的图像的新特征的需要，这通常在庞大的图库集和/或实时系统中非常昂贵或不可行（即人脸识别系统、社交网络、终身学习系统、机器人和监控系统）。我们的方法名为基于平稳性的兼容表示（CoReS），通过鼓励表示模型的平稳性来实现兼容性，而不依赖于先前学习的模型。平稳性使特征的统计特性在时间偏移下不发生变化。",
