    "abstract": "In the recent past, a property of neural training trajectories in weight-space had been isolated, that of \"local elasticity\" (denoted as $S_{\\rm rel}$). Local elasticity attempts to quantify the propagation of the influence of a sampled data point on the prediction at another data.

On various state-of-the-art neural network training on SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 we demonstrate how our new proposal of $S_{\\rm rel}$, as opposed to the original definition, much more sharply detects the property of the weight updates preferring to make prediction changes within the same class as the sampled data.  In neural regression experiments we demonstrate that the original $S_{\\rm rel}$ reveals a $2-$phase behavior -- that the training proceeds via an initial elastic phas",

    "translated_abstract": "在最近的研究中，我们发现了神经网络训练轨迹在权重空间中的一个属性，即“局部弹性”（表示为$S_{\\rm rel}$）。局部弹性试图量化样本数据点对预测结果在其他数据点上的影响传播。在本研究中，我们对已有的$S_{\\rm rel}$定义进行了全面研究，并提出了一个新的定义，解决了原始定义在分类设置中的局限性。通过在SVHN，CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上进行各种最先进的神经网络训练实验，我们展示了我们新的$S_{\\rm rel}$定义相比于原始定义更加敏锐地检测出权重更新更偏向于在与样本数据同一类别内进行预测变化的特性。在神经回归实验中，我们展示了原始$S_{\\rm rel}$显示出一个2阶段行为--通过初始弹性阶段进行训练。",
