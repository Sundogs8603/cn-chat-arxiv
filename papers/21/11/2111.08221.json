    "translated_abstract": "价格歧视是在网上零售中广泛使用的一种策略，指的是为不同的客户群体设定不同的价格。尽管它有助于提高网上零售商的收入，但可能引发关于公平性的严重担忧，甚至违反规定和法律。本文研究了在公平性约束下的动态歧视性定价问题。具体而言，我们考虑了一个有限销售周期长度为T的单一产品，有两组客户。每组客户都有其未知的需求函数需要学习。对于每个销售周期，卖家确定每组的价格并观察其购买行为。虽然现有文献主要关注最大化收入，但在动态定价文献中尚未充分探讨确保不同客户之间的公平性。本研究采用了Cohen等人（2022）的公平概念。对于价格公平性，我们提出了一种最优动态方案。",
