    "translated_abstract": "本文基于路径随机微积分，定义了一个连续的实函数$x$具有粗糙指数$R$，如果$x$的$p$阶变差在$p>1/R$时趋向于零，而在$p<1/R$时趋向于无穷大。对于许多随机过程的样本路径，例如分数布朗运动，其粗糙指数存在并等于标准赫斯特参数。在我们的主要结果中，我们提供了在Faber-Schauder系数上的一个温和条件，使得粗糙指数存在，并且给出为经典Gladyshev估计$\\widehat{R_n}(x)$的极限。这个结果可以被视为Gladyshev估计器在完全无模型设置中的强一致性结果，因为在函数$x$的可能动态方面没有任何假设。尽管如此，我们的证明具有概率性，依赖于隐藏在$x$的Faber-Schauder展开中的一个鞅。由于Gladyshev估计器不是尺度不变的，我们构造了若干量尺度不变的有用推广。",
