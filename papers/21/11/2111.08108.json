In this paper, we propose novel learning frameworks to tackle optimal control problems. By applying the Pontryagin maximum principle to the original optimal control problem, the learning focus shifts to reduced Hamiltonian dynamics and corresponding adjoint variables. The reduced Hamiltonian networks can be learned by going backward in time and then minimizing loss function deduced from the Pontryagin maximum principle's conditions. The learning process is further improved by progressively learning a posterior distribution of reduced Hamiltonians, utilizing a variational autoencoder which leads to more effective path exploration process. We apply our learning frameworks to control tasks and obtain competitive results.",

    "translated_abstract": "通过应用庞特里亚金最大值原理，然后求解哈密顿动力系统，最优控制问题可以得到解决。本文提出了新颖的学习框架来解决最优控制问题。通过将庞特里亚金最大值原理应用于原始最优控制问题，学习重点转移到了减少的哈密顿动力学和相应的伴随变量上。减少的哈密顿网络可以通过向后推进时间，然后最小化从庞特里亚金最大值原理条件推导出的损失函数来学习。通过逐渐学习减少的哈密顿的后验分布，利用变分自动编码器进一步改进了学习过程，从而导致更有效的路径探索过程。我们将我们的学习框架应用于控制任务并获得了竞争力的结果。",
