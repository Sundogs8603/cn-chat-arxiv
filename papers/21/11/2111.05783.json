We use stacked event studies and difference-in-difference models to estimate the impact of mine openings and closings. The magnitude of the effect of mine openings is considerable - after 15 years, urban areas within 20km of an opening mine almost double in size. We find strong evidence of a political resource curse at the local level. Although mining boosts the local economy in democratic countries, these gains are meager in autocracies and come at the expense of tripling the likelihood of conflict relative to prior the onset of mining. Furthermore, our results suggest that the growth acceleration in mining areas is only temporary and diminishes with the closure of the mine.",

    "translated_abstract": "运用计算机视觉的最新技术，我们分析了1984年至2019年期间覆盖非洲大陆12%的100万张卫星图像，跟踪1,658个矿床周围的当地发展情况。我们使用堆积事件研究和差异法模型来估计矿井开放和关闭的影响。矿井开放的影响程度相当大- 15年后，在开放矿井20公里内的城市地区几乎增长了一倍。我们发现强有力的政治资源诅咒在地方层面存在。尽管矿业在民主国家中提振了当地经济，但在威权主义国家中，这些收益微不足道，并以三倍于矿业开展前的冲突可能性为代价。此外，我们的研究结果表明，在矿区加速增长仅是暂时的，随着矿井关闭而减退。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了在非洲矿业开采对当地经济的影响，结果发现矿井开放会显著促进当地城市地区的增长，但政治资源诅咒存在于威权主义国家，而短暂的增长仅会随着矿井的关闭而减退。",
