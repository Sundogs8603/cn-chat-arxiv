    "translated_abstract": "Koopman 算子是无限维算子，全局线性化非线性动力系统，因此它们的谱信息对于理解动力学非常有价值。然而，Koopman 算子可能具有连续的谱和无限维不变子空间，使得计算它们的谱信息成为一个巨大的挑战。本文介绍了一种数据驱动算法，它具有严格的收敛性保证，可以计算从轨迹数据中获得的 Koopman 算子的谱信息。我们介绍了剩余动态模态分解（ResDMD），这是第一个从快照数据中计算普通 Koopman 算子的谱和伪谱的方案，而不会产生谱污染。利用共轭算子和 ResDMD，我们计算与普通的保测度动力系统相关的谱测量的平滑近似值。我们证明了算法的显式收敛定理，即使在混沌系统中，我们的算法也可以达到高阶收敛。",
