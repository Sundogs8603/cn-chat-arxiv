    "translated_abstract": "最近，许多提高了区分能力的改进朴素贝叶斯方法已经被开发出来。其中，通过平衡区分能力和泛化能力，正则化朴素贝叶斯(RNB)产生出色的性能。在朴素贝叶斯中，数据离散化非常重要。通过将类似的值分组为一个区间，可以更好地估计数据分布。然而，现有方法，包括RNB，经常将数据离散化为太少的间隔，这可能导致显着的信息丢失。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种半监督的自适应判别离散化框架，用通过伪标签技术利用标记数据和未标记数据，可以更好地估计数据分布。该提出的方法还通过使用自适应判别离散化方案，显着降低了离散化过程中的信息损失，从而极大地提高了分类器正则化朴素贝叶斯的区分能力。",
