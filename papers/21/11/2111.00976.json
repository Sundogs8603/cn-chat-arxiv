    "abstract": "Phone-level pronunciation scoring is a challenging task, with performance far from that of human annotators. Standard systems generate a score for each phone in a phrase using models trained for automatic speech recognition (ASR) with native data only. Better performance has been shown when using systems that are trained specifically for the task using non-native data. Yet, such systems face the challenge that datasets labelled for this task are scarce and usually small. In this paper, we present a transfer learning-based approach that leverages a model trained for ASR, adapting it for the task of pronunciation scoring. We analyze the effect of several design choices and compare the performance with a state-of-the-art goodness of pronunciation (GOP) system. Our final system is 20% better than the GOP system on EpaDB, a database for pronunciation scoring research, for a cost function that prioritizes low rates of unnecessary corrections.",

    "translated_abstract": "单音素级别的发音评分是一个具有挑战性的任务，现有系统的性能距离人工评分还有很大差距。标准系统利用仅包含本地数据的自动语音识别 (ASR) 模型为短语中的每个音素生成一个得分。使用针对此任务专门训练的系统以及非本地数据进行训练可以获得更好的性能。然而，这种方法面临着标注数据稀缺且通常很小的挑战。本文提出了一种基于迁移学习的方法，利用为ASR训练的模型，将其调整为发音评分任务。我们分析了几个设计选择对性能的影响，并将其与最先进的发音质量 (GOP) 系统进行了比较。针对一个优先考虑不必要修正率较低的成本函数，在EpaDB，一个用于发音评分的数据库上，我们的最终系统比GOP系统更好20％。",
