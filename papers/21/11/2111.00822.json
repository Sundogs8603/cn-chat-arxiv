    "abstract": "Using a large quarterly macroeconomic dataset for the period 1960-2017, we document the ability of specific financial ratios from the housing market and firms' aggregate balance sheets to predict GDP over medium-term horizons in the United States. A cyclically adjusted house price-to-rent ratio and the liabilities-to-income ratio of the non-financial non-corporate business sector provide the best in-sample and out-of-sample predictions of GDP growth over horizons of one to five years, based on a wide variety of rankings. Small forecasting models that include these indicators outperform popular high-dimensional models and forecast combinations. The predictive power of the two ratios appears strong during both recessions and expansions, stable over time, and consistent with well-established macro-finance theory.",

    "translated_abstract": "利用1960-2017年的大型季度宏观经济数据集，我们记录了住房市场和企业总资产负债表中特定金融比率在美国中期时段内预测GDP的能力。根据各种不同排名，调整后的房价租金比率和非金融非公司营业部门的负债收入比率在一到五年的时间段内提供了最佳的样本内和样本外预测GDP增长。包含这些指标的小型预测模型胜过流行的高维度模型和预测组合。这两个比率的预测能力在衰退和扩张期间都很强，随时间稳定，并与已建立的宏观金融理论一致。",

These ratios demonstrate strong predictive power during both recessions and expansions, exhibit stability over time, and align with established macro-finance theory."
