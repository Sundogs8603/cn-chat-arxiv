    "translated_abstract": "本文研究弱监督文本分类问题，旨在将文本文档分类为一组预定义的类别，仅使用类别表面名称，而无需提供任何标注的训练文档。目前大部分现有分类器利用每个文档中的文本信息。然而，在许多领域中，文档附带各种类型的元数据（例如作者、出处和研究论文的年份）。这些元数据及其组合可能作为强有力的类别指标，用于辅助文本分类。本文通过异构信息网络建模文档和元数据之间的关系，并通过图案描述元数据组合以有效捕捉网络中的高阶结构。我们提出了一个名为MotifClass的新框架，该框架（1）选择具有类别指示意义的图案实例，（2）检索和生成元数据的表示以进行文本分类。",

By using motifs to describe the combinations of metadata, the framework effectively captures higher-order structures and selects category-indicative motif instances for classification."
