    "abstract": "Nowadays, as more and more systems achieve good performance in traditional voice conversion (VC) tasks, people's attention gradually turns to VC tasks under extreme conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel method for zero-shot voice conversion. We aim to obtain intermediate representations for speaker-content disentanglement of speech to better remove speaker information and get pure content information. Accordingly, our proposed framework contains a module that removes the speaker information from the acoustic feature of the source speaker. Moreover, speaker information control is added to our system to maintain the voice cloning performance. The proposed system is evaluated by subjective and objective metrics. Results show that our proposed system significantly reduces the trade-off problem in zero-shot voice conversion, while it also manages to have high spoofing power to the speaker verification system.",

    "translated_abstract": "如今，在传统语音转换任务中，越来越多的系统都能够取得良好的性能，人们的注意力逐渐转向极端条件下的语音转换任务。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的零样本语音转换方法。我们旨在获得语音的中间表示，以实现说话人内容分离，更好地消除说话人信息，获取纯粹的内容信息。因此，我们的提出的框架包含一个模块，用于从源发声者的声学特征中去除说话人信息。此外，我们的系统添加了说话人信息控制，以维持语音克隆性能。我们使用主观和客观指标评估了所提出的系统。结果表明，我们的提出的系统显著降低了零样本语音转换中的折衷问题，同时还具有高的欺骗性能，可以对抗说话人验证系统。",
