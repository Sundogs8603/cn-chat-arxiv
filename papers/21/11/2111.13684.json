    "translated_abstract": "近期的研究将交通预测问题转化为一个时空图建模问题。通常，研究人员在每个时间步构建一个静态的空间图，然后用相邻时间步之间的节点连接表示为时空图。然而，这种方法未能明确反映不同时间步之间不同节点之间的相关性，从而限制了图神经网络的学习能力。此外，这些模型通过在不同时间步之间使用相同的邻接矩阵来忽略节点之间的动态时空相关性。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一种称为时空联合图卷积网络 (STJGCN) 的新方法，用于在多个未来时间步骤上准确预测道路网络上的交通流量。具体而言，我们的方法包括构建预定义的和自适应的时空联合图 (STJGs) 以及在 STJGs 上执行图卷积运算以提取时空特征并进行多步预测。在两个真实数据集上的实验结果表明，我们的方法优于现有的最先进方法。",
