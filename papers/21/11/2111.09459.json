They typically arise as the continuum limit of exchangeable particle systems evolving by some mean-field interaction involving a gradient-type potential. However, in many problems, such as in multi-layer neural networks, the so-called particles are edge weights on large graphs whose nodes are exchangeable. Such large graphs are known to converge to continuum limits called graphons as their size grow to infinity. We show that the Euclidean gradient flow of a suitable function of the edge-weights converges to a novel continuum limit given by a curve on the space of graphons that can be appropriately described as a gradient flow or, more technically, a curve of maximal slope. Several natural functions on graphons, such as homomorphism functions and the scalar entropy, are covered by our set-up, and the examples have been worked out in detail.",

    "translated_abstract": "在各种优化问题中，Wasserstein梯度流在概率测度上发现了许多应用。它们通常出现为交换粒子系统的连续极限，这些粒子系统通过某种涉及梯度型势能的均场相互作用演化。然而，在许多问题中，诸如多层神经网络中，所谓的粒子是大图上的边权重，其节点是可交换的。这样的大图已知在其大小趋于无穷大时收敛到称为图函数的连续极限。我们证明了适当函数的欧几里得梯度流收敛到图函数空间上的一条新型连续极限，可适当描述为梯度流或更技术性地说，是一条最大斜率曲线。我们的设置涵盖了图函数上的几个自然函数，例如同态函数和标量熵，并且已经详细计算了这些例子。",
