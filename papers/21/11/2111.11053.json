    "translated_abstract": "许多应用程序利用移动设备和机器学习传感器提供新服务。然而，不同的用户、设备和环境等因素影响这些应用程序的性能，从而使域漂移成为移动感知中的关键问题。尽管尝试了域适应来解决这个具有挑战性的问题，但由于各种因素之间的复杂相互作用，它们的性能是不可靠的。原则上，性能不确定性可以通过使用基本真相标签进行性能验证来识别和赎回。然而，对于每个用户收集高质量、足够的标记数据是不可行的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了DAPPER（域自适应性能估计器），它可以在没有标记的目标数据的情况下估计目标域中的自适应性能。我们的核心思想是基于特征和性能之间的相互信息来近似模型性能，并利用移动传感器上的个性化作为自然校准来接近基本的真相标签。在真实世界数据集上的实验中，DAPPER在目标域的相关性方面比现有的域适应方法表现更好，最高可提高11%。",
