    "abstract": "Real-time location inference of social media users is the fundamental of some spatial applications such as localized search and event detection. While tweet text is the most commonly used feature in location estimation, most of the prior works suffer from either the noise or the sparsity of textual features. In this paper, we aim to tackle these two problems. We use topic modeling as a building block to characterize the geographic topic variation and lexical variation so that \"one-hot\" encoding vectors will no longer be directly used. We also incorporate other features which can be extracted through the Twitter streaming API to overcome the noise problem. Experimental results show that our RATE algorithm outperforms several benchmark methods, both in the precision of region classification and the mean distance error of latitude and longitude regression.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体用户的实时位置推断是一些空间应用（如本地搜索和事件检测）的基础。虽然推文文本是位置估计中最常用的特征，但大多数之前的工作都受到文本特征噪声或稀疏性的影响。本文旨在解决这两个问题。我们使用主题建模作为构建模块，以表征地理主题变化和词汇变化，从而不再直接使用“one-hot”编码向量。我们还结合通过Twitter流API提取的其他特征来克服噪声问题。实验结果表明，我们的RATE算法在地区分类的准确性和纬度经度回归的平均距离误差方面优于几种基准方法。",
