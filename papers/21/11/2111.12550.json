    "translated_abstract": "众包系统已成为一种有效的平台，通过使用非专家工人以相对较低的成本为数据标注。然而，从多个不准确答案中推断正确的标签一直是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为答案的质量在任务和工人之间差异较大。许多现有工作假设工人的技能水平存在固定的排序，并着重于估计工人技能以汇总来自具有不同权重的工人的答案。然而，在实践中，特别是在任务异质性很大时，工人的技能在任务间变化很大。在本文中，我们考虑了一种新模型，称为$d$-type特化模型，其中每个任务和工人都有自己的（未知）类型，并且每个工人的可靠性可以在给定任务的类型和工人的类型上变化。我们允许类型数$d$随着任务数量的增加而扩展。在这个模型中，我们表征了使纠正答案达到最优样本复杂度的能力。",

The model considers the specialization types of tasks and workers, as well as the variability of worker reliability. It characterizes the optimal sample complexity for achieving correct answers."
