    "abstract": "There has been recent and growing interest in the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles, encouraged by the empirical successes of powerful artificial intelligence techniques (AI), especially in the applications of deep learning and reinforcement learning. However, as demonstrated by recent traffic accidents, autonomous driving technology is not fully reliable for safe deployment. As AI is the main technology behind the intelligent navigation systems of self-driving vehicles, both the stakeholders and transportation regulators require their AI-driven software architecture to be safe, explainable, and regulatory compliant. In this paper, we propose a design framework that integrates autonomous control, explainable AI (XAI), and regulatory compliance to address this issue, and then provide an initial validation of the framework with a critical analysis in a case study. Moreover, we describe relevant XAI approaches that can help achieve the goals of the framework.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，自主驾驶车辆的发展和部署正越来越受到关注，尤其是深度学习和强化学习等强大人工智能技术的实证成功。但是，正如最近的交通事故所表明的那样，自动驾驶技术无法完全保证安全部署。由于人工智能技术是自动驾驶车辆智能导航系统背后的主要技术，因此利益相关者和交通监管机构要求他们的基于人工智能的软件架构必须具备安全性、可解释性和监管合规性。本文提出了一个设计框架，集成自主控制、可解释的人工智能和监管合规性，以解决这个问题，接着通过案例研究进行了框架的初步验证。此外，我们还介绍了相关的可解释的人工智能方法，以帮助实现框架的目标。",
