    "translated_abstract": "最小化器和卷积神经网络(CNN)是两种完全不同的流行技术，均被用于分析生物序列。从表面上看，这些方法似乎完全不同。最小化器使用滚动窗口的最小哈希方法提取每个窗口中的一个重要k-mer特征。CNN则以随机初始化的卷积滤波器和池化操作为基础，通过多个神经层来学习滤波器本身及其用于分类序列的方法。本文主要结果是对哈希函数属性进行了仔细的数学分析，显示对于分类字母表上的序列，使用随机高斯初始化的卷积滤波器和最大池化等价于选择一个最小化器排序，使得选择的k-mer与序列中的k-mer（按汉明距离）相距较远，但与其他最小化器相距较近。在实证实验中，我们发现这种方法能够有效降低计算复杂度并与传统方法具有相当的性能。",
