    "translated_abstract": "在视频中检测异常事件通常被构建为一个单类分类任务，其中训练视频仅包含正常事件，而测试视频包含正常和异常事件。在这种情况下，异常检测是一个开放集问题。但是，一些研究将异常检测与动作识别相同。这是一个闭集场景，无法测试系统检测新异常类型的能力。为此，我们提出了UBnormal，一个由多个虚拟场景组成的新的监督式开放集Benchmark，用于视频异常检测。与现有数据集不同，我们在训练时引入了像素级异常事件注释，首次使异常事件检测可以使用全监督学习方法。为了保持典型的开放集公式，我们确保在视频的训练和测试集合中包含不相交的异常类型集合。据我们所知，UBnormal是第一个视频异常检测基准。",
