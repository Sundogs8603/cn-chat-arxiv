    "translated_abstract": "聚类分析需要做出许多决策：聚类方法和隐含的参考模型、聚类数目，以及通常还有一些超参数和算法的调整。在实践中，我们会得到多个划分，最终根据验证或选择准则选择一个最终的划分。存在大量的验证方法，它们隐式或显式地假设某种聚类概念。此外，它们常常被限制在特定方法得到的划分上进行操作。本文聚焦于可以通过二次或线性边界很好分隔的群组。基于二次判别得分函数和描述聚类大小、中心和散布的参数，我们定义了参考聚类概念。我们开发了两个聚类质量准则，称为二次得分。我们展示了这些准则与一般类别的椭圆对称分布生成的群组一致。在应用中，寻找这种类型的群组是常见的。",
