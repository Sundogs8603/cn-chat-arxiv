    "translated_abstract": "主动推断是一个关于感知和行动的统一理论，其基本思想是通过最小化自由能来维持大脑对世界的内部模型。从行为学角度来看，主动推断代理可以被看作是自证明的存在，他们行动以实现他们乐观的预测，即优选结果或目标。相比之下，强化学习需要人工设计的奖励来实现任何期望的结果。虽然主动推断可以为控制提供一种更自然的自监督目标，但其适用性受到了在复杂环境中扩展方法的局限性。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种对比目标，用于主动推断，可以显著减少学习代理生成模型和规划未来行动的计算负担。我们的方法在基于图像的任务中比基于似然的主动推断表现更好，同时计算成本更低且更易于训练。",
