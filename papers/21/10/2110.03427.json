    "translated_abstract": "语言识别（LID）是自动语音识别（ASR）领域中的关键预处理过程，涉及从音频样本中识别出讲话语言。当前能够处理多种语言的系统要求用户在使用之前明确指定一种或多种语言。在多语言环境下，当ASR系统无法理解讲话语言时，LID任务扮演着重要的角色，导致语音识别结果失败。本研究引入了基于卷积循环神经网络（CRNN）的LID方法，设计用于处理音频样本的梅尔频率倒谱系数（MFCC）特征。此外，我们复制了一些最先进的方法，特别是卷积神经网络（CNN）和基于注意力的卷积循环神经网络（带有注意力的CRNN），并与我们的基于CRNN的方法进行了比较分析。我们进行了一项实验",
