    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种新颖的对抗重编程（AR）方法，用于低资源口语命令识别（SCR），并构建了一个AR-SCR系统。AR过程旨在修改来自目标领域的声学信号，以重新调整预训练的SCR模型，从而实现重编程。为了解决源域和目标域之间的标签不匹配问题，并进一步提高AR的稳定性，我们提出了一种新颖的基于相似性的标签映射技术来对齐类别。此外，将迁移学习（TL）技术与原始AR过程相结合，以提高模型的适应能力。我们在三个低资源SCR数据集上评估了提出的AR-SCR系统，包括阿拉伯语、立陶宛语和言语障碍性普通话。实验结果表明，在大规模英语数据集上训练的预训练AM的基础上，提出的AR-SCR系统在阿拉伯语和立陶宛语命令数据集上表现优于当前最先进的结果，且仅使用有限数量的数据。",
