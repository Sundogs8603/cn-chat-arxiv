    "translated_abstract": "强化学习（RL）是解决顺序决策任务的有效框架。然而，在医疗环境中应用RL方法具有挑战性，部分原因是由于患者的治疗反应的异质性。一些患者可以使用标准方案进行治疗，而其他患者，如慢性疾病患者，需要个性化的治疗计划。传统的RL方法通常无法考虑到这种异质性，因为它们假设所有患者对治疗的反应是相同的（即，转移动力学是共享的）。我们引入了组合Fitted $Q$-迭代（CFQI），它使用复合任务结构来表示医疗环境中的异质性治疗反应。复合任务由相同任务的几个变体组成，每个变体的难度逐渐增加；解决较简单的变体可以实现更高效地解决更难的变体。CFQI使用一个复合$Q$值函数，其中为每个任务模块单独表示。",
