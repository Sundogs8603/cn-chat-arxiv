    "translated_abstract": "受生物神经元的多样性启发，二次人工神经元在深度学习模型中起着重要的作用。我们感兴趣的二次神经元类型将传统神经元中的内积运算替换为二次函数。尽管二次神经元网络取得了有希望的结果，但仍存在一些重要问题尚未得到很好的解决。从理论上讲，二次网络相比传统网络或传统网络通过二次激活的表达能力优越性尚未完全阐明，这使得二次网络的使用缺乏坚实的理论基础。从实践上讲，虽然可以通过通用反向传播方法训练二次网络，但它可能面临比传统对应网络更高的崩溃风险。为了解决这些问题，我们首先应用样条理论和代数几何中的一个度量来给出两个定理，证明了二次网络相比传统网络具有更好的模型表达能力。",
