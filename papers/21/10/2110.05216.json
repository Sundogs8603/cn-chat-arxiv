Tensor descriptors require a robust similarity measure due to low numbers of aggregated vectors and the burstiness phenomenon, when a given feature appears more/less frequently than statistically expected. The Heat Diffusion Process (HDP) on a graph Laplacian is closely related to the Eigenvalue Power Normalization (EPN) of the covariance/auto-correlation matrix, whose inverse forms a loopy graph Laplacian.

    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了一种利用注意机制进行高阶张量池化的方法，旨在捕捉神经网络生成的特征向量的高阶统计信息，形成张量描述符。张量描述符要求具备鲁棒的相似性度量，以应对聚合向量数量较少和爆发现象，即某些特征出现的频率高于或低于统计预期的情况。我们将图拉普拉斯矩阵上的热扩散过程与协方差/自相关矩阵的特征值幂归一化（EPN）密切相关，其逆形成了一个环状图拉普拉斯矩阵。我们证明了热扩散过程与EPN具有相同的作用，即增强或减弱特征值谱的幅度，从而防止爆发现象。我们将高阶张量配备了EPN，它可以作为高阶出现的谱检测器，以防止爆发现象。我们还证明，对于一个由d维特征描述符构建的阶数为r的张量，这样的检测器可以给出至少存在一个高阶出现的可能性。",
