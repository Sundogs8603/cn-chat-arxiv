    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种用于偏差数据损失的通用矩阵分解方法，将普遍存在的奇异值分解扩展到平方误差损失之外。虽然之前已经有类似的方法，但我们的方法利用了广义线性模型（GLM）的经典统计方法，并提供了一个灵活的算法，可以通过条目权重来处理结构性零元素。此外，通过调整GLM理论的结果，我们通过以下方式支持这些分解：（i）在GLM设置下显示强一致性，（ii）通过广义Hosmer-Lemeshow检验检验所选择指数族分布的适应性，以及（iii）通过最大特征值间隔法确定分解的秩。为了进一步支持我们的发现，我们进行了模拟研究，评估对分解假设的鲁棒性，并使用图像人脸识别、自然语言处理、网络分析和生物医学等基准数据集进行了广泛的案例研究。",
