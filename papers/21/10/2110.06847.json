    "translated_abstract": "我们定义“ousiometrics”为在任何有意义信号传递的上下文中研究基本意义的学科，“telegnomics”为远程感知知识的研究。通过中期出现的工作，基本意义已被普遍接受为由评估（evaluation）、效能（potency）和激活（activation）三个正交维度很好地捕捉。通过重新检查英语语言的类型和标记，以及通过使用自动注释的直方图——“ousiograms”，我们发现：1. 用单词传达的基本含义最好用指南针般的强度-危险（PD）框架来描述。2. 对大规模英语语言语料库（文学、新闻、维基百科、脱口秀和社交媒体）的分散集合进行分析显示，自然语言对安全、低危险的词汇存在系统偏见，这是对Pollyanna原则的书面表达积极偏差的重新解释。",
