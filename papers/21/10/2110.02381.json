    "translated_abstract": "尽管文献中提出了大量的R峰检测器，但其在低质量和噪声干扰较大的移动心电图（ECG）传感器（如Holter监测仪）所采集的信号中的鲁棒性和性能水平可能会明显下降。最近，深度一维卷积神经网络（CNN）已经解决了这个问题，在Holter监测仪中取得了最先进的性能水平；然而，它们的复杂性较高，需要特殊并行化硬件设置进行实时处理。另一方面，它们的性能在使用紧凑网络配置时会下降。这是预期的结果，因为最近的研究表明，CNN的学习性能受到限制，因为它们具有严格的同质配置和单一线性神经元模型。在本研究中，为了进一步提高峰值检测性能并实现优雅的计算效率，我们提出了一维自组织操作神经网络(Self-ONNs)。",
