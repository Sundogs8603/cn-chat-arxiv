    "translated_abstract": "在因果推断中，估计动态治疗效应是一项重要的任务，尤其是当面临高维混淆变量时。双重稳健 (DR) 方法因其灵活性而成为估计治疗效应的有力工具。然而，我们展示了仅关注预期结果的 DR 传统方法可能无法提供最优结果。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的 DR 方法，用于中间条件结果模型的 DR 表示，从而提供了更优的稳健性保证。只要每个暴露时间和治疗路径都恰当地参数化了至少一个辅助函数，所提出的方法即使在面临高维混淆变量时也能实现一致性。我们的结果代表了一个重大的进步，因为它们提供了新的稳健性保证。实现这些结果的关键是我们的新 DR 表示，它在需要比以前的方法更弱的假设条件下提供了更好的推断性能。",
