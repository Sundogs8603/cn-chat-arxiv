People with insufficient sleep are more likely to report physical and mental distress, activity limitation, anxiety, and pain.

In this paper, we utilize the relationship between physical activity and sleep quality to find ways of assisting people improve their sleep using machine learning techniques. People usually have several behavior modes that their bio-functions can be divided into. Performing time series clustering on activity data, we find cluster centers that would correlate to the most evident behavior modes for a specific subject. Activity recipes are then generated for good sleep quality for each behavior mode within each cluster. These activity recipes are supplied to an a",

    "translated_abstract": "睡眠质量对人们的身体和心理健康有深远影响。睡眠不足的人更容易报告身体和心理困扰、活动受限、焦虑和疼痛。此外，过去几年中，活动监测和健康跟踪的应用和设备方兴未艾。从这些可穿戴设备收集到的信号可用于研究和改善睡眠质量。本文利用实体活动和睡眠质量之间的关系，利用机器学习技术找到协助人们改善睡眠的方法。对活动数据进行时间序列聚类，我们找到与特定主题最显着的行为模式相关的簇中心。然后为每个行为模式中的每个簇生成有助于良好睡眠质量的活动建议。这些活动建议供应给每位用户的个性化活动推荐系统。",
