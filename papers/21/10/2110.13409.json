Existing Siamese neural network (SNN)-based malware detection methods fail to correctly classify different malware families when such obfuscated malware samples are present in the training dataset, resulting in high false-positive rates. To address this issue, we propose a novel task-aware few-shot-learning-based Siamese Neural Network that is resilient against the presence of malware variants affected by such control flow obfuscation techniques. Using the average entropy features of each malware family as inputs, in addition to the image features, our model generates the parameters for the feature layers, to more accurately adjust the feature embedding for different malware families, each of which has obfuscated malware variants.

    "translated_abstract": "恶意软件作者采用不同的控制流混淆技术创建新的恶意软件变种以避免检测。现有的基于Siamese神经网络（SNN）的恶意软件检测方法在训练数据集中存在这些混淆样本时无法正确分类不同的恶意软件家族，导致高误报率。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的任务感知少样本学习的Siamese神经网络，它可以抵抗受控制流混淆影响的恶意软件变种的存在。利用每个恶意软件家族的平均熵特征作为输入，除了图像特征外，我们的模型还生成特征层的参数，以更准确地为不同的恶意软件家族调整特征嵌入，这些家族都有混淆的恶意软件变种。此外，我们提出的方法可以对恶意软件类进行分类，即使只有一个或很少的训练样本可用。",
