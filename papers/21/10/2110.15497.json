    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种名为深度区域竞争（DRC）的算法，用于以完全无监督的方式从图像中提取前景对象。前景提取可以看作是通用图像分割的特殊情况，其重点是识别和解开背景中的对象。在这项工作中，我们通过将基于能量的先验与生成式图像建模（Mixture of Experts，MoE）相结合重新思考前景提取，进一步引入学习的像素重新分配作为捕捉背景区域规律性的重要归纳偏见。通过这种建模，可以通过期望最大化（Expectation-Maximization，EM）自然地找到前景-背景分区。实验证明，所提出的方法有效地利用了在分区过程中混合分量之间的相互作用，这与通用图像分割的开创性方法——区域竞争密切相关。",
