A major contribution is that we introduce the dynamic listwise distillation, where we design a unified listwise training approach for both the retriever and the re-ranker. During the dynamic distillation, the retriever and the re-ranker can be adaptively improved according to each other's relevance information.

    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言处理任务中，Passage检索和Passage重新排名是寻找和排序相关信息的两个关键步骤。由于两个步骤都对最终性能有贡献，因此联合优化它们以实现相互提高至关重要。本文提出了一种新颖的稠密Passage检索和Passage重新排名的联合训练方法。其中一个主要贡献是引入了动态listwise蒸馏，在其中为检索器和重新排名器设计了统一的listwise训练方法。在动态蒸馏过程中，检索器和重新排名器可以根据彼此的相关性信息自适应地改进。我们还提出了一种混合数据增强策略，用于构造丰富的listwise训练实例。广泛的实验表明，我们的方法在MSMARCO和自然问题数据集上都非常有效。我们的代码可在https://github.com/microsoft/DensePhrases上获得。",
