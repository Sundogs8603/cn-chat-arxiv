    "abstract": "Unlike commercial ridesharing, non-commercial peer-to-peer (P2P) ridesharing has been subject to limited research -- although it can promote viable solutions in non-urban communities. This paper focuses on the core problem in P2P ridesharing: the matching of riders and drivers. We elevate users' preferences as a first-order concern and introduce novel notions of fairness and stability in P2P ridesharing. We propose algorithms for efficient matching while considering user-centric factors, including users' preferred departure time, fairness, and stability. Results suggest that fair and stable solutions can be obtained in reasonable computational times and can improve baseline outcomes based on system-wide efficiency exclusively.",

    "translated_abstract": "与商业共乘不同，非商业P2P共乘受到了有限的研究，虽然它可以促进非城市社区的可行解决方案。本文关注P2P共乘中的核心问题：乘客和司机的匹配。我们将用户的偏好提升为一级考虑，并在P2P共乘中引入了公平性和稳定性的新概念。我们提出了高效匹配算法，同时考虑到用户中心化因素，包括用户的首选出发时间、公平性和稳定性。结果表明，可以在合理的计算时间内获得公平和稳定的解决方案，且可以基于系统范围内的效率独占地改善基线结果。",
