    "translated_abstract": "作为网络分析中的一个基本问题，结构节点相似度在学术界受到了广泛关注，并在各种应用中得到了应用。在众多提出的结构节点相似度度量中，由于满足多个公理属性，角色相似度凸显出来。现有的角色相似度度量无法处理大型真实网络上的top-k查询，因为时间和空间成本高。本文提出了一种新的角色相似度度量，即\\textsf{ForestSim}。我们证明了\\textsf{ForestSim}是一种可容忍的角色相似度度量，并设计了相应的top-k相似度搜索算法，即\\textsf{ForestSimSearch}，一旦预计算完成，能够在$O(k)$的时间内处理一个top-k查询。此外，我们通过使用快速近似算法来计算森林矩阵的对角线元素来加速预计算。",
