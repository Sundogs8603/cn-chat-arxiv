    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个统一的方法来解决随机投资组合理论（SPT）中的几个问题，这是一个涉及大量股票$d$的权益市场框架。我们的方法将开放市场（交易仅限于前$N$个市值最高的股票以及由所有$d$个资产组成的市场组合）与一个我们称为混合雅各比过程的参数化模型族相结合。我们对遗传性、粒子碰撞和边界达成进行了详细分析，并利用这些结果来研究相关金融市场。它们的特性包括(1) 资本分配曲线的稳定性和(2) 无杠杆和显式增长最优策略。雅各比排名模型子类还被额外证明(3) 在模型模糊性下作为一个强鲁棒性渐近增长问题的最坏情形模型，以及(4) 在大$d$极限下表现出稳定性。我们对开放市场的定义是对现有市场的放宽。",
