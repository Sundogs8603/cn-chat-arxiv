    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了协作纯探索在核赌博中的问题（CoPE-KB），为多智能体多任务决策提供了一个新的模型，并适用于许多在线学习任务，例如推荐系统和网络调度。我们考虑了CoPE-KB的两种设置，即固定置信度（FC）和固定预算（FB），并设计了两种最优算法CoopKernelFC（用于FC）和CoopKernelFB（用于FB）。我们的算法配备了创新的高效内核估计器，以同时实现计算和通信效率。在统计和通信度量下建立匹配的上下界，以证明我们的算法的最优性。理论界限成功地量化了任务相似性对学习加速度的影响，并且仅取决于内核化特征空间的有效维数。我们提出的分析技术在现有文献中将协作纯探索和非参数贝叶斯方法相结合，并将其应用于核赌博问题的求解。",
