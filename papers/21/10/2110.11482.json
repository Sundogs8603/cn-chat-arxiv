This paradigm shift introduces new challenges in assessing the impact of data-driven initiatives. To support these evolving methodologies, there is a crucial need for new models capable of describing the uncertainties stemming from limited data observability and the resulting ambiguities in decision-making. This contribution presents a novel conceptual model designed to deal with uncertainty in knowledge representations and reasoning about information transfer mediated by agents. Drawing from the multidimensional frameworks currently adopted to assess the value generated in data-driven initiatives, we provide an algebraic description of knowledge states and their dynamics. Specifically, we endow our model with a formal structure to compare and combine knowledge states; an update is represented through these combinations",

    "translated_abstract": "借助人工智能的出现推动的新兴数据驱动策略正在重塑决策过程，远离对直接数据交互的传统依赖。这种范式转变引入了评估数据驱动举措影响的新挑战。为了支持这些不断发展的方法论，迫切需要新的模型，能够描述源于有限数据可观测性以及由此产生的决策中的歧义的不确定性。本文提出了一个新颖的概念模型，旨在处理知识表示中的不确定性，并推理代理人进行信息传输的不确定性。借鉴目前用于评估数据驱动举措产生的价值的多维框架，我们提供了对知识状态及其动态的代数描述。具体而言，我们赋予我们的模型一种形式化结构，用于比较和组合知识状态；通过这些组合来表示更新。",
