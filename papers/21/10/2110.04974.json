    "translated_abstract": "基于梯度的双层优化（BLO）方法已被广泛用于处理现代学习任务。然而，大多数现有的策略都是基于苛刻的假设（例如，下一层子问题的凸性），并且对于高维任务计算上不可行。此外，在那些具有功能约束和悲观BLO等挑战性场景中，几乎没有基于梯度的方法能够解决BLO。本文通过将BLO重构为近似的单层问题，提供了一种名为双层价值函数序列最小化（BVFSM）的新算法以解决上述问题。具体而言，BVFSM构建了一系列基于价值函数的近似，从而避免了现有方法所需的重复计算循环梯度和Hessian逆的时间消耗，特别适用于高维任务。我们还扩展了BVFSM以解决具有额外功能约束的BLO。",
