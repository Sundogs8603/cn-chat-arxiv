    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统可能会受到各种混杂因素的干扰，导致推荐结果不准确，性能下降。目前解决这个问题的方法通常是为每个特定的混杂因素设计特定的模型。然而，现实世界中可能包含大量混杂因素，因此为每个特定的混杂因素设计特定的模型可能并不现实。更重要的是，除了那些专家可以手动识别和处理的“明确混杂因素”之外，还有许多“潜在混杂因素”超出了专家的想象力。例如，用户对一首歌的评分可能取决于他们当时的心情或当前的天气情况，用户对冰淇淋的偏好可能取决于空气温度。这些潜在混杂因素在记录的训练数据中可能是不可观察的。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了解混杂因果协同过滤方法。",
