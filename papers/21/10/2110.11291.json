    "translated_abstract": "薛定谔桥（SB）是一种熵正则化的最优输运问题，与基于分数的生成模型（SGM）相比，在深度生成建模中由于其数学灵活性而越来越受到关注。然而，尚不清楚SB的优化原则是否与现代深度生成模型的训练相关，后者通常依赖于构建对数似然目标。这引发了关于SB模型作为生成应用的原则性替代方法的适用性问题。在本工作中，我们提出了一种新的计算框架，用于基于正向-反向随机微分方程理论对SB模型进行似然训练——这是一种出现在随机最优控制中的数学方法，它将SB的最优性条件转化为一组SDE。关键是，这些SDE可以用于构建SB的似然目标，令人惊讶的是，它广义地推广了SGM的一些特殊情况。这导致了一种新的优化方法。",
