    "translated_abstract": "物化模型查询旨在寻找最合适的物化模型作为模型重用的初始模型。这是模型重用的前提条件，并且最近受到了广泛关注。然而，现有方法存在提供源数据的需求，应用范围有限和效率低等问题，因为它们没有构建适合度量物化模型目标相关知识的度量标准。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了\\textsf{MMQ}，这是一个无需源数据，通用，高效且有效的物化模型查询框架。它使用基于高斯混合模型的度量标准称为分离度来对物化模型进行排序。对于每个物化模型，\\textsf{MMQ}首先通过直接应用该模型将目标数据集中的样本向量化为概率向量，然后利用高斯分布为每个概率向量类进行拟合，最后在高斯分布上使用分离度来衡量相关知识。",
