    "translated_abstract": "自主机器人可以从人类提供的不确定任务环境和状态的语义描述中获得巨大的好处。然而，让机器人对这种“软数据”建模、通信和采取行动的综合策略仍具有挑战性。本文介绍了面向人-机器人团队的活动语义感知和规划的HARPS框架，以通过形式化结合在线采样型 POMDP 策略、多模态语义交互和贝叶斯数据融合来解决这些差距。该方法允许人类通过在环境中勾画和标记任意地标，机会地施加模型结构并扩展不确定环境中的语义软数据范围。在搜索过程中动态更新环境模型，使机器人代理可以主动询问人类获取新颖和相关的语义数据，从而提高未知环境和状态的信念，以实现更好的在线规划。",
