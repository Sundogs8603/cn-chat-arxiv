    "translated_abstract": "层级预测问题在时间序列具有自然的分组结构时出现，并需要在不同层次的聚合和分解中进行预测。在这种问题中，通常希望在给定的层次结构中满足聚合约束，称为层级一致性。在概率预测的情况下，保持一致性同时产生准确的预测可能是一个具有挑战性的问题。我们提出了一种新颖的方法，当存在可靠的层级信息时，可以进行准确和一致的概率时间序列预测。我们称之为深度泊松混合网络（DPMN）。它依赖于神经网络和一种统计模型的组合，用于层次多变量时间序列结构的联合分布。通过构建，该模型保证了层级一致性，并提供了用于预测分布聚合和分解的简单规则。我们在一个大规模的层级预测问题—M4竞赛上进行了实验，在非集成方法中，DPMN获得了最先进的结果。",
