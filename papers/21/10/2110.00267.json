    "abstract": "Network representation learning aims to generate an embedding for each node in a network, which facilitates downstream machine learning tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Current work mainly focuses on transductive network representation learning, i.e. generating fixed node embeddings, which is not suitable for real-world applications. Therefore, we propose a new inductive network representation learning method called MNCI by mining neighborhood and community influences in temporal networks. We propose an aggregator function that integrates neighborhood influence with community influence to generate node embeddings at any time. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets and compare MNCI with several state-of-the-art baseline methods on various tasks, including node classification and network visualization. The experimental results show that MNCI achieves better performance than baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "网络表示学习旨在为网络中的每个节点生成嵌入，其可促进节点分类和链接预测等下游机器学习任务。目前的工作主要集中在转导式网络表示学习，即生成固定节点嵌入，这不适合实际应用。因此，我们提出了一种新的归纳式网络表示学习方法MNCI，通过在时间网络中挖掘邻域和社区影响来生成节点嵌入。我们提出了一个聚合函数，将邻域影响与社区影响相结合，以在任何时间生成节点嵌入。我们在几个真实数据集上进行了广泛的实验，并将MNCI与几种最先进的基线方法进行了比较，包括节点分类和网络可视化等各种任务。实验结果表明，MNCI比基线方法具有更好的性能。",
