    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在soft-max参数化下的带熵正则化的约束马尔可夫决策过程(CMDPs)，其中智能体旨在最大化熵正则化价值函数的同时满足对期望总效用的约束。通过利用熵正则化，我们的理论分析表明它的Lagrangian对偶函数是平滑的，Lagrangian对偶间隙可以分解为原始最优间隙和约束违规。此外，我们提出了一种加速双下降方法用于带熵正则化的CMDPs。我们证明了我们的方法在熵正则化CMDPs的最优间隙和约束违反方面达到全局收敛速率$\\widetilde{\\mathcal {O}}(1/T)$。还提供了关于单约束CMDPs的线性收敛速率的讨论。",
