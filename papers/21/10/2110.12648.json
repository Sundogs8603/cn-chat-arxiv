    "translated_abstract": "跨领域推荐在解决数据稀疏性和冷启动问题方面已经取得了良好的结果。尽管如此，现有方法仅专注于领域可共享信息（重叠用户或相同的上下文）用于知识转移，并且没有这样的要求就很难进行良好的泛化。为了解决这些问题，我们建议利用对大多数电子商务系统通用的评论文本。我们的模型（名为SER）使用三个文本分析模块，由单一领域判别器指导进行解缠表示学习。在这里，我们提出了一种新的优化策略，可以提高领域解缠的质量，并削弱源领域的不良信息。此外，我们将编码网络从单个领域扩展到多个领域，这已被证明对于基于评论的推荐系统非常强大。广泛的实验和消融研究表明，与现有方法相比，我们的方法高效、稳健且可扩展。",
