    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了多赢者投票的PAC可学习性，重点关注基于批准的委员会评分（ABCS）规则。这些规则适用于具有批准票的选民档案，每个选民批准一部分候选人。根据ABCS规则，每个$k$候选人委员会从每个选民那里收集得分，该得分取决于选民票数和其与委员会的交集的大小。然后，得分最高的委员会获胜。我们的目标是学习目标规则（即学习相应的评分函数），并利用少量采样档案中获胜的委员会的信息。尽管与单赢者选举相比存在指数级的结果，但我们表明样本复杂性仍然较低：多项式数量的样本足够提供足够的信息，以高置信度和准确性学习目标规则。不幸的是，即使对于学习任务来说也很简单，需要解决的任务也很简单，为了学习，我们在实验中证明了样本采样的效果。",
