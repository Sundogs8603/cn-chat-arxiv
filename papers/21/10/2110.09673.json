    "translated_abstract": "经济转型——即经济所生产东西的变化——对于发展和提高生活水平至关重要。最近经济复杂性领域的两个研究方向推动了我们对这一过程的理解，一个研究经济如何多样化，另一个研究经济的复杂性如何在其产出的组成中体现。然而，这些学科之间的联系尚不清楚，以及它们如何与结构转型的经典理解相关。在这里，我们提出了一个简单的动态建模框架，将这些工作领域统一起来，基于普遍观察到的经济多样化倾向于与它们已经拥有的活动相关联。我们展示了如何从这一观察中自然地产生长期结构性变化的样式事实，以及复杂度度量。然而，复杂度度量具有新的含义，可以描述经济体验到的长期变化。",
