    "translated_abstract": "风险分析师根据多个信息来源评估潜在的财务损失。通常，评估不仅取决于损失随机变量的规范，还取决于不同的经济情景。受到这一观察的启发，我们设计了一个统一的公理框架，用于风险评估原则，同时量化损失随机变量和一组可能的概率。我们将这样的评估原则称为广义风险度量。我们提出了一系列相关的理论结果。通过不同的直观公理，我们表征了最坏情况、连贯和稳健的广义风险度量。我们在框架中建立了几种自然形式的法律不变性之间的等价性，并且其中的技术细微之处展示了我们的框架与传统框架之间的鲜明对比。此外，连贯性和强法律不变性是通过其他条件的组合推导出来的，这为连贯风险提供了额外的支持。",
