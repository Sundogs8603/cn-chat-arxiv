    "translated_abstract": "深度学习已被广泛应用于机器人学习算法中，但深度网络的不足之一在于这些网络是黑盒子表示形式。因此，学习到的近似值忽略了现有的物理或机器人学知识。特别是对于学习动力学模型而言，这些黑盒子模型并不理想，因为基本原理已经被很好地理解，标准深度网络可以学习违反这些原理的动力学。为了使用深度网络学习具有物理合理性动力学的模型，我们引入了受物理启发的深度网络，将物理学的基本原理与深度学习相结合。我们将Lagrangian力学纳入模型学习中，使得所有近似模型都遵循物理定律并保存能量。Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) 使用两个网络参数化系统能量。通过最小化欧拉-拉格朗日微分方程的平方残差来获得参数。",
