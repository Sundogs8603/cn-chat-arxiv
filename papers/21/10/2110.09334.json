For expensive-to-evaluate black-boxes, batch versions of Bayesian optimization have been proposed. They work by building a surrogate model of the black-box to simultaneously select multiple designs via an infill criterion. Still, despite the increased availability of computing resources that enable large-scale parallelism, the strategies that work for selecting a few tens of parallel designs for evaluations become limiting due to the complexity of selecting more designs. It is even more crucial when the black-box is noisy, necessitating more evaluations as well as repeating experiments.

    "translated_abstract": "为了缩短优化研究的时间，一种方法是并行评估设计，而不是逐个评估。针对昂贵的黑盒函数，已经提出了贝叶斯优化的批处理版本。它们通过建立黑盒函数的代理模型，通过填充准则同时选择多个设计。尽管现在有更多的计算资源可以支持大规模并行性，但选择几十个并行设计的策略由于选择更多设计的复杂性而变得有限。当黑盒又具有噪声时，需要更多的评估以及重复实验，这变得更加关键。在这里，我们提出一种可扩展的策略，可以本地与大规模批处理保持同步，专注于探索/开发权衡和投资组合分配。我们将这种方法与相关方法在噪声函数、单目标和多目标优化任务上进行比较。",
