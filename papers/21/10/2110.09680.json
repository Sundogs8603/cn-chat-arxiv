    "translated_abstract": "探索和分析大规模数据集最近在研究和发展社区中引起了越来越多的关注。长期以来，人们一直认识到许多数据集中包含大量缺失的数值数据。我们引入了一种基于Kriging理论的数学原则随机优化填补方法，该方法被证明是一种强大的填补方法。然而，其计算成本和潜在的数值不稳定性会导致昂贵和/或不可靠的预测，可能限制其在大规模数据集上的使用。在本文中，我们将最近开发的多层次随机优化方法应用于大规模医疗记录中的填补问题。该方法基于计算应用数学技术，并具有高精度。特别地，对于最佳线性无偏预测器（BLUP），该多层次形式化是精确的，而且计算速度更快，数值稳定性更高。",
