    "translated_abstract": "面向方面的情感分类（ABSC）揭示了不同方面之间情感极性的潜在依赖关系。我们的研究进一步探讨了这一现象，提出了相邻方面经常表现出相似情感的概念，我们称之为“方面情感相干性”。我们认为，当前的研究领域还没有充分重视建模方面情感相干性的重要性。为了解决这一问题，我们引入了一种本地情感聚合范式（LSA），可以促进精细的情感相干性建模。这种方法使得可以提取缺乏显式情感描述的方面的隐含情感。利用梯度下降，我们设计了一种差分加权情感聚合窗口，来指导方面情感相干性的建模。实验结果表明，LSA在学习情感相干性方面具有很好的效果，在三个公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，从而显著提高了情感学习的能力。",
