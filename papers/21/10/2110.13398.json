    "translated_abstract": "基于方面的情感分析（ABSA）旨在确定对某个方面的情感倾向。由于昂贵且有限的标记数据，预训练策略已成为ABSA的事实标准。然而，预训练和下游ABSA数据集之间总是存在严重的领域偏移，直接微调时的知识转移效果不佳，导致下游任务表现亚优化。为了缓解这种领域偏移，我们引入了一个统一的对齐预训练框架，包括实例和知识层面的对齐，将其融入到预训练和微调流程中。具体而言，我们首先设计了一种新颖的分阶段检索采样方法，从大规模的预训练数据集中选择与目标领域相关的实例，从而实现预训练和目标领域实例的对齐（第一阶段）。然后，我们引入了基于知识指导的策略，进一步桥接知识层面的领域差异。我们在基准ABSA数据集上评估了我们的方法，并展示了其超越强基线的卓越性能。我们的方法在多个ABSA数据集上实现了最先进的结果，包括SemEval 2014任务4、SemEval 2015任务12和SemEval 2016任务5。",
