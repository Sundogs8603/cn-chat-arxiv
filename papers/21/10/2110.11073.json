    "translated_abstract": "基于强化学习的推荐系统目标在于从一批收集的数据中学习到一个良好的策略，将推荐问题转化为多步决策任务。然而，现有的基于强化学习的推荐系统研究通常存在巨大的现实差距。本文首次介绍了一个开源的真实世界数据集——RL4RS，旨在取代之前RL-based RS领域由于资源限制而使用的人工和半仿真RS数据集。与学术研究不同的是，RL-based RS面临着部署前需要进行良好验证的困难。我们尝试提出一种新的系统评估框架，包括环境模拟评估、环境评估、反事实策略评估以及建立于测试集的环境评估。综上所述，本文介绍了一个新的资源RL4RS（用于推荐系统的强化学习），并对现实差距等特殊问题进行了思考，并提供了两个真实世界数据集。",
