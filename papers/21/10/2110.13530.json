Indeed, even if the latter are indisputably useful in many applications, they can be computationally expensive most of all in a real-time and many-query setting. Thus, our main goal is to provide a physics informed learning paradigm to simulate parametrized phenomena in a small amount of time. The physics information will be exploited in many ways, in the loss function (standard physics informed neural networks), as an augmented input (extra feature employment) and as a guideline to build an effective structure for the neural network (physics informed architecture). These three aspects, combined together, will lead to a faster training phase and to a more accurate parametric prediction. The methodology has been tested for several equations and also in an optimal control framework.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种物理信息监督学习策略的扩展方法，用于处理参数化偏微分方程。尽管参数化偏微分方程在许多应用中非常有用，但在实时和多查询情况下，它们往往具有较高的计算成本。因此，我们的主要目标是提供一种物理信息学习范式，以在短时间内模拟参数化现象。物理信息将通过损失函数（标准物理信息神经网络）、扩展输入特征（额外的特征利用）和构建有效神经网络的指导方针（物理信息架构）来得到充分利用。这三个方面的综合应用将加快训练过程，并提高参数化预测的准确性。本研究已应用于多个方程和最优控制框架中进行测试。",
