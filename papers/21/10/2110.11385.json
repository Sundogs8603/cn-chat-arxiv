    "translated_abstract": "随着越来越多的人工智能代理被实际应用，是时候考虑如何使这些代理完全自主，以便它们可以自主学习，而不是定期由人类工程师启动并使用扩展的训练数据进行重新训练。由于现实世界是一个具有未知或新颖性的开放环境，检测新颖性或未知性，描述它们，适应或适应它们，收集地面真实训练数据，并逐步学习未知和新颖性对于使代理越来越有知识和能力变得至关重要。关键挑战在于如何自动化这个过程，使其由代理主动进行并通过其与人类和环境的互动进行。由于人工智能代理通常有一个性能任务，因此对每种新颖性进行特征化变得至关重要和必要，以便代理可以制定",
    "tldr": "论文提出了一种自主开放世界学习的方法，使人工智能代理能够在自主、自我激励和自我监督的方式下学习，以应对未知或新颖性环境中的挑战，实现逐步学习和提升知识与能力。",
    "en_tdlr": "The paper introduces a method for self-initiated open world learning, enabling AI agents to learn in a self-motivated and self-supervised manner to tackle challenges in unknown or novel environments, facilitating incremental learning and enhancement of knowledge and capabilities."
