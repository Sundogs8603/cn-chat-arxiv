In this paper we solve the Dirichlet problem associated with the Monge-Amp\\`ere equation using neural networks and we show that an ansatz using deep input convex neural networks can be used to find the unique convex solution. As part of our analysis we study the effect of singularities, discontinuities and noise in the source function, we consider nontrivial domains, and we investigate how the method performs in higher dimensions. We investigate the convergence numerically and present error estimates based on a stability result.

    "translated_abstract": "Monge-Amp\\`ere 方程是分析、几何和应用科学中非常重要的一个全非线性偏微分方程。本文应用神经网络解决了与 Monge-Amp\\`ere 方程相关的迪利克雷问题，并且展示了使用深度凸输入神经网络的假设可以用来找到唯一的凸解。我们分析了奇异点、不连续点和源函数中的噪声对方法效果的影响，考虑了非平凡域，并研究了方法在高维情况下的性能。我们通过数值分析研究了收敛性并基于稳定性结果给出了误差估计。我们还将此方法与使用惩罚缺乏凸性的损失函数以及标准前馈网络结合使用的替代方法进行了比较。",
