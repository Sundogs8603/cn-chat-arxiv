    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个简化的模型来解决在线分类的问题。有两个大型的同质群体。每个人都必须在两个在线平台之间选择，其中一个平台拥有更好的便利设施。每个人都喜欢在网上与属于自己群体的人互动，但不喜欢与异类在同一个平台上。与居住区分类的Tiebout模型不同，两个平台都有无限容量，所以任何时候都可以任意更换。我们发现，一个在线平台从集成到隔离的转变是由当前的Schelling比率和每个平台上的每个群体的绝对数量的组合所引起的。也就是说，重要的是引起转变的集合而不是临界点。在某些情况下，一个群体从一个平台的逃逸可以被另一个群体比例的改变所触发，使那些离开的人变得更有利。如果希望在两个社群之间进行在线整合，那么最佳政策是明确的：使每个人的首选平台的质量都相同。",
