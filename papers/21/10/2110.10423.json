    "abstract": "Designing neural architectures requires immense manual efforts. This has promoted the development of neural architecture search (NAS) to automate the design. While previous NAS methods achieve promising results but run slowly, zero-cost proxies run extremely fast but are less promising. Therefore, it is of great potential to accelerate NAS via those zero-cost proxies. The existing method has two limitations, which are unforeseeable reliability and one-shot usage. To address the limitations, we present ProxyBO, an efficient Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that utilizes the zero-cost proxies to accelerate neural architecture search. We apply the generalization ability measurement to estimate the fitness of proxies on the task during each iteration and design a novel acquisition function to combine BO with zero-cost proxies based on their dynamic influence. Extensive empirical studies show that ProxyBO consistently outperforms competitive baselines on five tasks from three public ben",

    "translated_abstract": "设计神经架构需要巨大的人工努力。这促进了神经架构搜索（NAS）的发展，以自动化设计。虽然以前的NAS方法取得了有希望的结果，但运行速度较慢，而零成本代理运行极快，但前景不太乐观。因此，通过这些零成本代理加速NAS具有巨大的潜力。现有方法有两个限制，即不可预见的可靠性和一次性使用。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了ProxyBO，一种高效的贝叶斯优化（BO）框架，利用零成本代理加速神经架构搜索。我们应用广义能力测量来估计每次迭代中代理在任务上的适应性，并设计了一种新的收购函数，基于它们的动态影响将BO与零成本代理相结合。广泛的实证研究表明，ProxyBO在来自三个公共基准测试的五个任务上始终优于竞争基线。",
