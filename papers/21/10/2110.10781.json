    "abstract": "We present a revealed preference characterization of marital stability explicitly accounting for the divorce law governing marital dissolution. We focus on mutual consent divorce, where individuals can divorce their partner only if they can obtain their consent. We provide theoretical insights into the potential of the characterization for identifying intrahousehold consumption. Simulation exercises using household data drawn from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences (LISS) panel support our theoretical findings.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个基于揭示性偏好的婚姻稳定性刻画，明确考虑了调节婚姻解散的离婚法律。我们重点研究了互意离婚，即当事人只有在获得了对方的同意时才能离婚。我们提供理论见解，探讨了该刻画在确定家庭内消费方面的潜力。我们使用从“社会科学的网络化纵向研究”（LISS）小组抽取的家庭数据进行模拟实验，结果支持了我们的理论发现。",
