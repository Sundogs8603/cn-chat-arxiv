    "translated_abstract": "深度卷积神经网络在许多应用场景中存在高参数和计算冗余，必要时需要进行模型剪枝以获得轻量级和高效的网络。然而，大多数现有的剪枝方法是由经验启发式的，很少考虑通道的联合影响，导致性能不确定和次优。本文提出了一种新颖的基于类感知迹比优化的通道剪枝方法（CATRO），以减少计算负担并加速模型推理。利用少量样本的类别信息，CATRO通过特征空间判别度量多通道的联合影响，并合并保留通道的层次影响。通过将通道剪枝形式化为子模函数最大化问题，CATRO通过两阶段贪心迭代优化过程有效地解决了这个问题。更重要的是，我们提出了理论分析证明了我们所提出的CATRO方法的有效性和优越性。",

Furthermore, it formulates channel pruning as a submodular set function maximization problem and solves it efficiently via a two-stage greedy iterative optimization procedure, and has been proved to be effective and superior by theoretical analysis."
