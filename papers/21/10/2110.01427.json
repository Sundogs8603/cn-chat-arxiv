    "abstract": "Binary treatments are often ex-post aggregates of multiple treatments or can be disaggregated into multiple treatment versions. Thus, effects can be heterogeneous due to either effect or treatment heterogeneity. We propose a decomposition method that uncovers masked heterogeneity, avoids spurious discoveries, and evaluates treatment assignment quality. The estimation and inference procedure based on double/debiased machine learning allows for high-dimensional confounding, many treatments and extreme propensity scores. Our applications suggest that heterogeneous effects of smoking on birthweight are partially due to different smoking intensities and that gender gaps in Job Corps effectiveness are largely explained by differential selection into vocational training.",

    "translated_abstract": "二进制治疗通常是多种治疗的后期聚合，或可以细分为多种治疗版本。因此，效果可以由于效果差异或治疗差异而异质化。我们提出了一种分解方法，可以揭示隐藏的差异，避免虚假发现，并评估治疗分配质量。基于双重/去偏机器学习的估计和推断程序可以处理高维混杂、多种治疗和极端倾向得分。我们的应用研究表明，吸烟对出生体重的异质效应部分是由于不同的吸烟强度，而职业培训对工作军效果的性别差距在很大程度上可以通过选择性进入解释。",
