    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在没有转让的动态委托-代理模型中激励努力的最佳机制。代理人参与一个有不确定未来奖励的任务，并且可以在任何时候进行不可逆的推卸责任。委托人了解任务的奖励，并根据时间向代理人提供信息以激励努力。我们从闭式形式中推导出最优信息策略，并因此确定了两个条件，每个条件都保证了延迟披露的价值。首先，如果委托人对比代理人更不耐心，她更喜欢由延迟披露引起的提前投入的努力计划。在稳态环境下，只有当委托人比代理人更不耐心时，延迟披露才是有益的。其次，如果在没有任何信息披露的情况下环境使代理人逐渐变得悲观，那么提供延迟的消息可以抵消代理人信念下降趋势，并鼓励代理人工作更长时间。值得注意的是，这些结论是在一个静态环境下得出的，且仅适用于特定的情况。",

The optimal information policy is derived in a principal-agent model without transfers, and the value of delayed disclosure is identified under two conditions. The study suggests that delayed disclosure is valuable if the principal is more impatient than the agent or if the agent's belief exhibits a downward trend in the absence of information disclosure."
