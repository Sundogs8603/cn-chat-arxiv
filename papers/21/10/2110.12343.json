    "translated_abstract": "本文着眼于动态治疗规则下可观察马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）中的偏差控制式评估，基于假设系统为部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程，提出了一种估算器，即基于部分历史的重要性权重，并展示了当从行为策略中获得足够多的数据后，该估算器可以一致地估计目标策略的稳态平均回报。我们提供了估算器误差的上界，其多项式衰减于观测量的数量（即轨迹的数量乘以它们的长度），指数取决于目标策略和行为策略的重叠，以及基础系统的混合时间。此外，我们证明了该收敛速率在混合和重叠方面的假定下是极小化的。我们的结果表明，在POMDP中进行偏差控制式评估比在（完全观察到的）马尔可夫决策过程中进行偏差控制式评估更具挑战性，但比强化学习中的模型自由偏差控制式评估更容易。",
