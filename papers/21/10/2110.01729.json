    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一组新的特征，利用Karhunen-Loeve展开法来识别输入数据的潜在随机行为。这些新特征是通过基于最近的函数数据分析理论进行的坐标变换构建的，用于异常检测。相关的信号分解是用已知优化属性的层级张量积展开来逼近具有有限功能空间的随机过程（随机场）。原则上，这些低维空间可以捕捉给定名义类别的'底层信号'的大部分随机变化，并且可以将来自其它类别的信号拒绝为随机异常。通过名义类别的层级有限维展开，构建了一系列用于检测异常信号组件的正交嵌套子空间。然后使用这些子空间中的投影系数来训练用于异常检测的机器学习（ML）分类器。我们在几个基准数据集上评估所提出的方法，结果表明其胜过现有的最先进方法。",
