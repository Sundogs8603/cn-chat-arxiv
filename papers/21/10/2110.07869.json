    "translated_abstract": "近年来，图神经网络在许多基于图的任务中引起了越来越多的关注，并在其中取得了显著的性能，尤其是在图上半监督学习方面。然而，大多数现有的图神经网络都基于消息传递范式，在单一拓扑空间中迭代地聚合邻居信息。尽管它们取得了成功，但是图神经网络的表达能力受到一些缺点的限制，例如消息源扩展的不灵活性、忽视节点级消息输出的差异以及单一消息空间的限制。为了解决这些缺点，我们提出了一种新的消息传递范式，基于多步消息源的属性、节点特定的消息输出和多空间消息交互。为了验证其有效性，我们将这种新的消息传递范式实例化为一个名为DPGNN的双感知图神经网络，它应用了一种节点对步骤的注意机制来自适应地聚合节点特定的多步邻域信息。",
