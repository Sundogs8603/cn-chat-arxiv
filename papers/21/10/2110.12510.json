    "translated_abstract": "普通微分方程（ODE）是研究生物和物理过程系统动态的重要工具。ODE建模的一个核心问题是推断一个信号变量对另一个信号变量的个体调控作用的显著性。然而，对于具有未知调控关系的ODE建立置信带是具有挑战性的，并且仍然是一个开放的问题。在本文中，我们构建了针对具有未知函数和有噪声数据观测的ODE中个体调控函数的后正则化置信带。我们的提议是第一种这样的方法，并且建立在两个新颖的要素上。第一个要素是将再生核学习与局部泰勒展开相结合的新型局部化核学习方法，第二个要素是解决无穷维度函数和附加的测量误差的新的去偏方法。我们证明了所构建的置信带具有期望的渐近覆盖概率，并且能够恢复调控关系。",
