    "translated_abstract": "启发式搜索基于离散化搜索空间的方法来解决最短路问题，性能与离散化程度密切相关。过细的离散化复杂度高但可以更好地逼近连续搜索空间，而过粗的离散化可能会牺牲解法质量以快速得到解。对于大规模状态空间，跨越多个分辨率寻找解法可能是有益的，但定义离散化方法是具有挑战性的。最近提出的多分辨率A*(MRA*)算法跨越多个分辨率搜索，它在粗略分辨率上遍历大范围的无障碍区域并逃脱局部最小值，同时在较细略分辨率上可以穿越所谓的狭窄通道。本文中，我们开发了AMRA*，MRA*的实时版本。AMRA*尽可能使用粗分辨率快速找到解法，如果需要逐步细化。我们使用多个启发式来在每个分辨率水平上优先考虑搜索方向。在广泛的基准问题上，AMRA*优于MRA*和其他现有算法。",

    "en_tdlr": "AMRA* is an anytime version of the Multi-Resolution A*(MRA*) algorithm, which is an arbitrary multi-resolution and multi-heuristic A* algorithm. It can search across multiple resolutions, traverse large obstacle-free areas and narrow passageways, and try to find a solution quickly using coarse resolution and refine it gradually if necessary. AMRA* uses multiple heuristics to prioritize search directions at each resolution level and outperforms MRA* and other existing algorithms on a wide range of benchmark problems."
