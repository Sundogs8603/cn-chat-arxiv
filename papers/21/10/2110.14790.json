    "translated_abstract": "动态线性模型(DLMs)是时间序列分析中常用的模型，因其结构灵活、递归更新简单、能够处理缺失数据、能够进行概率预测而受到广泛应用。然而，对于计数时间序列而言，选项却非常有限：高斯DLMs需要连续数据，而基于泊松分布的替代方案则常常缺乏足够的建模灵活性。本文提出了一种新颖的半参数计数时间序列方法，即通过扭曲高斯DLMs进行建模。扭曲函数由两个部分组成：一个(非参数化的)转换算子，提供概率分布的灵活性；以及一个取整算子，确保离散数据生成过程的正确性。我们开发了扭曲DLMs的共轭推断方法，使得状态空间滤波和平滑分布的分析和递归更新成为可能。我们利用这些结果生成了用于推断和预测的定制和高效的算法，包括蒙特卡罗模拟以进行离线分析。我们的方法在模拟和现实世界的计数时间序列中表现优异。",
