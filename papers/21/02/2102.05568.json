    "abstract": "The cyber risk insurance market is at a nascent stage of its development, even as the magnitude of cyber losses is significant and the rate of cyber loss events is increasing. Existing cyber risk insurance products as well as academic studies have been focusing on classifying cyber loss events and developing models of these events, but little attention has been paid to proposing insurance risk transfer strategies that incentivise mitigation of cyber loss through adjusting the premium of the risk transfer product. To address this important gap, we develop a Bonus-Malus model for cyber risk insurance. Specifically, we propose a mathematical model of cyber risk insurance and cybersecurity provisioning supported with an efficient numerical algorithm based on dynamic programming. Through a numerical experiment, we demonstrate how a properly designed cyber risk insurance contract with a Bonus-Malus system can resolve the issue of moral hazard and benefit the insurer.",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然网络损失的规模越来越大且网络损失事件的发生率也在增加，但网络风险保险市场仍处于发展的初级阶段。现有的网络风险保险产品和学术研究一直关注对网络损失事件进行分类和模型开发，但很少关注通过调整风险转移产品的保费以激励网络损失减少的保险风险转移策略的提出。为了填补这一重要痛点，我们开发了一个基于奖惩系统的网络风险保险模型。具体而言，我们提出了一个网络风险保险和网络安全配置的数学模型，并支持动态规划的高效数值算法。通过数值实验，我们演示了一个正确设计的基于奖惩系统的网络风险保险合同如何解决道德风险的问题并让保险商受益的可能性。",
