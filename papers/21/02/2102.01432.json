    "translated_abstract": "偏微分方程（PDEs）的发现是应用科学和工程的重要任务。然而，数据驱动的PDEs发现通常具有挑战性，主要是由于所发现方程对噪声的敏感性以及模型选择的复杂性。在本工作中，我们提出了一种先进的贝叶斯稀疏学习算法，用于具有可变系数的PDE发现，尤其是当系数在空间或时间上具有相关性时。具体来说，我们应用了具有尖峰和平板先验的阈值贝叶斯组Lasso回归（tBGL-SS），并利用Gibbs采样器来对PDE系数进行贝叶斯后验估计。这种方法不仅增强了点估计的稳健性并具有有效的不确定性量化，而且通过将系数阈值集成为近似MCMC方法，减轻了来自贝叶斯推断的计算负担。",
