    "translated_abstract": "骨龄评估是临床实践中具有挑战性的任务，由于骨龄评估过程繁琐复杂。目前的自动骨龄评估方法很少考虑诊断逻辑，因此可能产生某些无法解释的隐藏状态和输出。因此，医生们可能很难与这些模型和谐合作，因为很难检查模型预测的正确性。本文提出了一种新的基于手部放射线检查图像的骨龄评估图像分析框架，称为Doctor Imitator（DI）模型。DI模型的设计是为了学习医生使用评分方法（例如Tanner-Whitehouse方法）进行骨龄评估的诊断逻辑。具体而言，DI模型的卷积层捕捉手部放射线检查图像感兴趣区域（ROIs）的局部特征，并通过我们提出的基于解剖学的组卷积进行ROI区域的得分预测，最后进行求和得到骨龄预测结果。",
