In this conditional framework, we determine the structure of arbitrage-free prices. Moreover, we characterize attainability and market completeness. We derive a conditional version of the second fundamental theorem of asset pricing, which, surprisingly, is not available up to now. The main tool we use are time consistency properties of dynamic nonlinear expectations, which we apply to the super- and subhedging prices. The results obtained extend existing results in the literature, where the conditional setting is considered in most cases only on finite probability spaces.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在离散时间下的金融市场，并研究基于任意时间点可用信息的定价和对冲。在这个条件框架内，我们确定了无套利价格的结构。此外，我们还表征了可达性和市场完备性。我们推导出资产定价第二基本定理的条件版本，令人惊讶的是，这个版本到目前为止还没有被提出过。我们使用的主要工具是动态非线性期望的时间一致性性质，我们将其应用于超级和子对冲价格。所得到的结果扩展了文献中现有的结果，在大多数情况下，文献中只考虑了有限概率空间下的条件设置。",
