Accurate activation detection can be guided by the fact that very few voxels are, in reality, truly activated and that these voxels are spatially localized, but it is challenging to incorporate both these facts. We address these twin challenges to single-subject and low-signal fMRI by developing a computationally feasible and methodologically sound model-based approach, implemented in the R package MixfMRI, that bounds the a priori expected proportion of activated voxels while also incorporating spatial context. An added benefit of our methodology is the ability to distinguish voxels and regions having different intensities of activation. Our suggested approach is evaluated in realistic two- and three-dimensional simulation experiments as well as on multiple real-world datasets. Final",

    "translated_abstract": "功能性磁共振成像（fMRI）用于对刺激的大脑激活进行成像，但是在低信号环境和单个受试研究中往往难以检测到这种激活。考虑到实际上只有极少数体素真正被激活，而且这些体素在空间上是局部化的，因此可以通过准确的激活检测来指导。本研究通过发展一种计算可行和方法学上合理的基于模型的方法来应对这个挑战，在 R 包 MixfMRI 中实现，其限制了先验预期的激活体素比例，并结合了空间上下文。我们的方法的一个附加优势是能够区分不同强度激活的体素和区域。本研究的方法在现实的二维和三维模拟实验以及多个真实世界数据集中得到评估。",
