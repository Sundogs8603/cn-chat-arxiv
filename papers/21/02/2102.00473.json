    "abstract": "Causal Bayesian networks have become a powerful technology for reasoning under uncertainty in areas that require transparency and explainability, by relying on causal assumptions that enable us to simulate hypothetical interventions. The graphical structure of such models can be estimated by structure learning algorithms, domain knowledge, or a combination of both. Various knowledge approaches have been proposed in the literature that enable us to specify prior knowledge that constrains or guides these algorithms. This paper introduces some novel, and also describes some existing, knowledge-based approaches that enable us to combine structure learning with knowledge obtained from heterogeneous sources. We investigate the impact of these approaches on structure learning across different algorithms, case studies and settings that we might encounter in practice. Each approach is assessed in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, including graphical accuracy, model fitting, complexity, and",
