    "abstract": "We compare two jury selection procedures meant to safeguard against the inclusion of biased jurors that are perceived as causing minorities to be under-represented. The Strike and Replace procedure presents potential jurors one-by-one to the parties, while the Struck procedure presents all potential jurors before the parties exercise their challenges. Struck more effectively excludes extreme jurors but leads to a worse representation of minorities. The advantage of Struck in terms of excluding extremes is sizable in a wide range of cases. In contrast, Strike and Replace better represents minorities only if the minority and majority are polarized. Results are robust to assuming the parties statistically discriminate against jurors based on group identity.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们比较了两种旨在防止包含有偏见的陪审员的陪审团选派程序，这被认为会导致少数族群代表不足。逐一交替选派程序一次向各方提供潜在陪审员的信息，而先选派程序在各方行使挑选权之前，向各方展示所有潜在陪审员。先选派程序更有效地排除了极端陪审员，但导致少数族群的代表不足。在各种案件中，先选派程序在排除极端陪审员方面的优势相当大。相反地，只有当少数族群和多数族群存在极化时，逐一交替选派程序才更好地代表了少数族群。结果表明，即使在假定各方基于群体身份进行统计歧视的情况下，结果也是稳健的。",
