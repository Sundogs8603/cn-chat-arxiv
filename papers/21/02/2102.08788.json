    "translated_abstract": "在许多研究项目中，使用AUC作为性能评价指标，比较不同机器学习模型的质量是最后的步骤之一。许多方法都是在隐私敏感数据上训练的，如果这些数据集不能共享或联合使用进行训练和/或测试，则有多种不同的方法，如 ε-差分隐私、联合机器学习和密码学。在这种情况下，计算全局 AUC 可能也是一个问题，因为标签可能也包含隐私敏感信息。已经有一些基于 ε-差分隐私的方法来解决这个问题，但据我们所知，还没有引入确切的隐私保护解决方案。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于 MPC 的解决方案，称为 ppAURORA，它能够从多个来源提取并排序列表，进行隐私合并，计算与在汇集的原始测试样本上获得的完全相同的 AUC。使用 ppAURORA，计算时间只会比原始的计算略有延迟。",
