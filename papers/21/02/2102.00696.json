Our approach extends the conventional encoder-decoder structure by integrating Convolutional Long-short Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks. In addition, we incorporate attention and context matcher mechanisms into the model architecture. Our Weather Model achieves significant performance improvements compared to baseline deep learning models, including ConvLSTM, TrajGRU, and U-Net.
