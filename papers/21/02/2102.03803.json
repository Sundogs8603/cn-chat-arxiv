    "abstract": "We study a variant of online convex optimization where the player is permitted to switch decisions at most $S$ times in expectation throughout $T$ rounds. Similar problems have been addressed in prior work for the discrete decision set setting, and more recently in the continuous setting but only with an adaptive adversary. In this work, we aim to fill the gap and present computationally efficient algorithms in the more prevalent oblivious setting, establishing a regret bound of $O(T/S)$ for general convex losses and $\\widetilde O(T/S^2)$ for strongly convex losses. In addition, for stochastic i.i.d.~losses, we present a simple algorithm that performs $\\log T$ switches with only a multiplicative $\\log T$ factor overhead in its regret in both the general and strongly convex settings. Finally, we complement our algorithms with lower bounds that match our upper bounds in some of the cases we consider.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种在线凸优化的变种，其中玩家在T轮中的期望切换决策不超过S次。之前的研究已经解决了离散决策设置中的类似问题，最近也在连续设置中使用自适应对手进行了研究。在本研究中，我们旨在填补这一空白，并在普遍存在的无知设置中提出计算有效的算法，为一般凸损失建立了O(T/S)的遗憾上界以及强凸损失的近似O(T/S^2)的遗憾上界。此外，对于随机独立同分布的损失，我们提出了一种简单的算法，在一般和强凸设置中遗憾仅有对数因子的乘法log T的情况下进行了log T次切换。最后，我们补充了与我们考虑的一些情况相匹配的下界来补充我们的算法。",
