    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence have shown that the combination of tree-based planning with deep learning can lead to superior performance. We present Adaptive Entropy Tree Search (ANTS) - a novel algorithm combining planning and learning in the maximum entropy paradigm. Through a comprehensive suite of experiments on the Atari benchmark we show that ANTS significantly outperforms PUCT, the planning component of the state-of-the-art AlphaZero system. ANTS builds upon recent work on maximum entropy planning methods - which however, as we show, fail in combination with learning. ANTS resolves this issue to reach state-of-the-art performance. We further find that ANTS exhibits superior robustness to different hyperparameter choices, compared to the previous algorithms. We believe that the high performance and robustness of ANTS can bring tree search planning one step closer to wide practical adoption.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的人工智能突破表明，将基于树的规划与深度学习相结合可以实现更高的性能。本论文提出了一种称作自适应熵树搜索（ANTS）的全新算法，将规划和学习结合在最大熵范式中。通过在Atari基准测试上进行全面的实验，我们证明ANTS明显优于目前最先进的AlphaZero系统的规划组件PUCT。ANTS建立在最大熵规划方法的基础之上，然而我们发现这种方法在与学习相结合时表现不佳，ANTS解决了这个问题并达到了与目前最先进算法相当的性能水平。此外，我们还发现ANTS在不同的超参数选择下表现出更强的稳健性。我们相信，ANTS的高性能和稳健性将使基于树的规划方法更加适用于实际应用。",
