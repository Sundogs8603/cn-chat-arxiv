    "translated_abstract": "De novo基因组组装是基因组学中一个相关但计算复杂的任务。尽管de novo组装器已经成功地在几个基因组项目中使用，但仍然没有\"最佳组装器\"，组装器的选择和设置仍然依赖生物信息学专家。因此，与其他计算复杂问题一样，机器学习可能会成为开发更准确和自动化组装器的一种替代（或补充）方式。强化学习已被证明在解决无监督情况下的复杂活动（如游戏）方面很有前景，迫切需要了解该方法在“真实”问题（如DFA问题）中的局限性。该研究旨在探讨机器学习在基因组组装中的应用，使用强化学习（RL）。我们在文献中发现的唯一先前方法的基础上进行了扩展，以仔细探索学习过程。",
