This paper introduces a robust sensitivity analysis for IPW that estimates the range of treatment effects compatible with a given amount of unobserved confounding. The estimated range converges to the narrowest possible interval (under the given assumptions) that must contain the true treatment effect. Our proposal is a refinement of the influential sensitivity analysis by Zhao, Small, and Bhattacharya (2019), which we show gives bounds that are too wide even asymptotically.

    "translated_abstract": "反向权重（IPW）是一种常用的从观测数据中估计治疗效应的方法。然而，它的正确性依赖于不可测试（且经常难以置信）的假设，即所有混淆因素都已被测量。本文提出了一种对IPW进行坚韧的敏感性分析，用于估计与给定量的未观察到的混淆因素相容的治疗效应范围。估计的范围收敛于最窄的可能区间（在给定假设下）,包含真实的治疗效应。我们的提议是赵，Small和Bhattacharya（2019）的影响力敏感性分析的改进，我们表明，即使渐近地，该方法给出的界限也过宽。这种分析基于Tan（2006）边际敏感性模型的新部分鉴别结果。",
