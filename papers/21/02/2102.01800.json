    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在Elliott-Golub-Jackson网络模型中进行最优干预，并展示其可转化为类似于影响力最大化的形式，被解释为默认级联的反向。我们将最优干预问题的分析扩展到经济网络设置中，并证明几个关于最优干预的结论：它是NP难的，并且不能在多项式时间内以常数近似。反过来，我们展示随机化失败阈值导致了问题的一个版本，该版本是单调子模块化的，现有的多项式时间强近似可以应用于该问题。除了最优干预之外，我们还展示了我们分析在其他经济网络问题方面的实际影响：（1）计算经济网络的期望价值具有计算复杂性，（2）影响力最大化算法可以实现有效的进口。",
    "tldr": "该论文研究了经济网络中最优干预的问题，发现该问题是NP难，但随机化失败阈值可以使问题变为单调子模块化的形式，从而使用现有的多项式时间强近似算法。同时，在其他经济网络问题方面，该论文也发现计算经济网络期望价值具有计算复杂性，但影响力最大化算法可以实现有效的进口。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the problem of optimal intervention in economic networks, showing that it is NP-hard but can be approximated using a randomized failure thresholds approach that leverages existing polynomial-time approximations. The authors also explore practical implications for calculating expected values and enabling efficient imports using influence maximization algorithms in economic network settings."
