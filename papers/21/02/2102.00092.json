    "abstract": "Booking control problems are sequential decision-making problems that occur in the domain of revenue management. More precisely, freight booking control focuses on the problem of deciding to accept or reject bookings: given a limited capacity, accept a booking request or reject it to reserve capacity for future bookings with potentially higher revenue. This problem can be formulated as a finite-horizon stochastic dynamic program, where accepting a set of requests results in a profit at the end of the booking period that depends on the cost of fulfilling the accepted bookings. For many freight applications, the cost of fulfilling requests is obtained by solving an operational decision-making problem, which often requires the solutions to mixed-integer linear programs. Routinely solving such operational problems when deploying reinforcement learning algorithms may be too time consuming. The majority of booking control policies are obtained by solving problem-specific mathematical program",

    "translated_abstract": "预订控制问题是收益管理领域中出现的顺序决策问题。更确切地说，货运预订控制侧重于决定是否接受或拒绝预订请求：在有限的容量下，接受预订请求或拒绝它以保留容量供未来可能具有更高收益的预订使用。这个问题可以被形式化为一个有限时间段的随机动态规划，其中接受一组请求导致在预订期结束时获得的利润，该利润取决于履行接受的预订的成本。对于许多货运应用，满足请求的成本是通过解决运营决策问题获得的，这通常需要解决混合整数线性规划的解决方案。在部署强化学习算法时，常规解决此类运营问题可能太耗费时间。大多数预订控制策略是通过解决特定于问题的数学规划问题获得的。",
