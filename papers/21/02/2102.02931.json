    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一个新的双边稳定匹配问题，描述了澳大利亚一所大学的暑期实习匹配实践。该模型是Kamada和Kojima关于带有分布约束的匹配问题的两个模型之间的一个案例。我们研究了三个解决概念，即Kamada和Kojima提出的强稳定性和弱稳定性概念，以及两者之间的一个新概念，称为截断稳定性。Kamada和Kojima证明了在其最受限制的具有不相交区域配额的模型中可能不存在强稳定匹配。我们的第一个结果是检查其存在性是NP困难的。然后，我们展示了不仅适用于暑期实习问题，而且适用于具有任意遗传约束的一般匹配模型的截断稳定匹配存在。我们提出了一个计算截断稳定匹配的算法，并证明在我们特殊的暑期实习模型中它运行在多项式时间内。但是，我们还展示了寻找最大规模截断稳定匹配是NP困难的。",
