    "abstract": "This paper studies inference in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with covariate-adaptive randomization (CAR) and imperfect compliance of a binary treatment. In this context, we study inference on the LATE. As in Bugni et al. (2018,2019), CAR refers to randomization schemes that first stratify according to baseline covariates and then assign treatment status so as to achieve \"balance\" within each stratum. In contrast to these papers, however, we allow participants of the RCT to endogenously decide to comply or not with the assigned treatment status.  We study the properties of an estimator of the LATE derived from a \"fully saturated\" IV linear regression, i.e., a linear regression of the outcome on all indicators for all strata and their interaction with the treatment decision, with the latter instrumented with the treatment assignment. We show that the proposed LATE estimator is asymptotically normal, and we characterize its asymptotic variance in terms of primitives of the problem.",
