    "abstract": "We propose a simple, statistically principled, and theoretically justified method to improve supervised learning when the training set is not representative, a situation known as covariate shift. We build upon a well-established methodology in causal inference, and show that the effects of covariate shift can be reduced or eliminated by conditioning on propensity scores. In practice, this is achieved by fitting learners within strata constructed by partitioning the data based on the estimated propensity scores, leading to approximately balanced covariates and much-improved target prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our general-purpose method on two contemporary research questions in cosmology, outperforming state-of-the-art importance weighting methods. We obtain the best reported AUC (0.958) on the updated \"Supernovae photometric classification challenge\", and we improve upon existing conditional density estimation of galaxy redshift from Sloan Data Sky Survey (SDSS) data.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种简单、具有统计学原理和理论基础的方法，用于在训练集不具代表性的情况下改进监督学习，这种情况被称为协变量漂移。我们建立在因果推断中一种成熟的方法基础之上，表明协变量漂移的影响可以通过在因次分数上进行条件约束来减少或消除。在实践中，通过在估计的因次分数的基础上对数据进行分层构造，从而实现平衡协变量，显著提高目标预测结果。我们在两个现代宇宙学研究问题上证明了我们这种一般性方法的有效性，超越了最先进的重要性加权方法。我们在更新的“超新星光度分类挑战”中获得了最好的AUC值（0.958），并改进了现有的SDSS数据中的星系红移条件密度估计。",
