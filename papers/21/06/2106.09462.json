    "abstract": "In recent years, the extraction of opinions and information from user-generated text has attracted a lot of interest, largely due to the unprecedented volume of content in Social Media. However, social researchers face some issues in adopting cutting-edge tools for these tasks, as they are usually behind commercial APIs, unavailable for other languages than English, or very complex to use for non-experts. To address these issues, we present pysentimiento, a comprehensive multilingual Python toolkit designed for opinion mining and other Social NLP tasks. This open-source library brings state-of-the-art models for Spanish, English, Italian, and Portuguese in an easy-to-use Python library, allowing researchers to leverage these techniques. We present a comprehensive assessment of performance for several pre-trained language models across a variety of tasks, languages, and datasets, including an evaluation of fairness in the results.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，从用户生成的文本中提取观点和信息引起了很大的兴趣，主要是由于社交媒体中内容的前所未有的数量。然而，社会研究人员在采用最先进的工具进行这些任务时会遇到一些问题，因为这些工具通常落后于商业API，不适用于除英语以外的其他语言，或者对非专家来说非常复杂。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了pysentimiento，这是一个全面的多语言Python工具包，专为观点挖掘和其他社交自然语言处理任务而设计。这个开源库提供了易于使用的Python库，其中包含了用于西班牙语、英语、意大利语和葡萄牙语的最先进模型，可以让研究人员利用这些技术。我们对几种预训练语言模型在各种任务、语言和数据集上的性能进行了全面评估，包括对结果公平性的评估。",
