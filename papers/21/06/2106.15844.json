    "translated_abstract": "尽管博弈论对决策制定具有转型性的作用，但在某些情况下，所假设的条件可能过于严格。在本研究中，我们调查了理性的一些潜在假设，如互相一致性和最优反应，并考虑使用级别K推理和量化反馈平衡（QRE）的概念放宽这些假设的方法。具体而言，我们提出了一个名为Quantal Hierarchy模型的信息论双参数模型，可以放宽互相一致性和最优反应的限制，同时在极限情况下近似级别K，QRE或典型的Nash均衡行为。该模型基于变分自由能原理的递归形式，将更高阶推理表示为演化形式博弈树中的（伪）序列决策制定。这种表示方法使我们能够以类似于顺序博弈的方式处理同时博弈，其中推理资源在游戏中逐渐耗尽。",
