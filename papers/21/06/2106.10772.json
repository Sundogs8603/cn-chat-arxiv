    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个模型来解释冲突在决定信号规范崛起和衰落中的潜在作用。一个群体中的个体被高和低生产力类型所特征化，并且它们以配对的形式形成社交关系，如交配或觅食关系。在每个关系中，个体的收益随其自身类型和配偶类型的增加而增加。因此，一个关系的收益结构不类似于困境情况。假设类型是不可观测的。在一个群体中，通过信号化维持了按类型分类的同类匹配。在另一个群体中，个体不发出信号，并且它们是随机匹配的。类型在每个群体中演化。与此同时，这两个群体可能参与冲突。由于同类匹配，高类型在有信号的群体中增长更快，但它们承担了信号的成本，这在长期来看降低了他们群体的适应能力。通过模拟实验，我们发现冲突可以导致信号规范的崩溃，并且该崩溃会传播到相对封闭的群体。",
