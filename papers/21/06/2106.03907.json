    "translated_abstract": "代理因果学习（PCL）是一种在存在未观察到的混淆因素时，利用代理（结构化侧面信息）估计治疗对结果的因果效应的方法。这是通过两阶段回归实现的：在第一阶段，我们建模治疗和代理之间的关系；在第二阶段，我们利用这个模型来学习在给定代理提供的上下文下，治疗对结果的影响。PCL在可识别条件下保证恢复真实的因果效应。我们提出了一种新的PCL方法，深度特征代理变量方法（DFPV），以解决代理、治疗和结果为高维且具有非线性复杂关系的情况，如深度神经网络特征表示。我们表明DFPV在具有挑战性的合成基准测试中优于最近的最先进的PCL方法，包括涉及高维图像数据的设置。此外，我们还展示了PCL的应用...",

By modeling the relations between treatments and proxies, and learning the effect of treatments on outcomes given the proxies, PCL guarantees recovery of the true causal effect.
