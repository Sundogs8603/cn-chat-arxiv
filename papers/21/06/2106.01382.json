    "translated_abstract": "机器学习的研究者和实践者不断扩大成功的学习模型的多样性。他们通过深入的理论分析和经验性的启发来实现这一点。然而，目前没有已知的通用过程可以严格评估新提出的模型是否确实能够从数据中成功学习。我们展示了这样的过程不能存在。对于PAC二分类、统一和通用的在线学习，以及通过教师-学习者交互进行准确学习，学习性在一般情况下是不可判定的，即在形式系统中公理的独立性和无法计算性的意义上都是如此。我们的证明通过可计算的构造将形式系统的一致性问题和图灵机的停机问题编码为某些函数类是平凡/有限还是高度复杂，然后将这些类与通过已建立的学习性特征化是否可学习相关联。",
