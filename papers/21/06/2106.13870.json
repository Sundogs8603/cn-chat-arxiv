Deep neural networks commonly used for image classification are deterministic maps from an input image to an output class. As such, their outcome on a given datum involves no uncertainty, so we must specify what variability we are referring to when defining, measuring and interpreting uncertainty, and attributing \"confidence\" to the outcome. To this end, we introduce the Wellington Posterior, which is the distribution of outcomes that would have been obtained in response to data that could have been generated by the same scene that produced the given image. Since there are infinitely many scenes that could have generated any given image, the Wellington Posterior involves inductive transfer from scenes other than the one portrayed. We explore the use of data augmentation, dropout, ensembling, single-view reconstruction, and model linearization to compute a Wellington Posterior. ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种方法来估计在给定输入数据上图像分类器结果的不确定性。用于图像分类的深度神经网络是从输入图像到输出类别的确定性映射。因此，它们在给定数据上的结果不涉及不确定性，因此必须在定义、测量和解释不确定性，并将“置信度”归因于结果时指定所引用的变化性。为此，我们介绍了惠灵顿后验，它是在可能由生成给定图像的相同场景生成的数据的响应中获得的结果分布。由于可以生成任何给定图像的无限多个场景，因此惠灵顿后验涉及来自除所描绘的场景之外的场景的归纳传递。我们探索了使用数据增强、丢弃、集成、单视图重建和模型线性化来计算惠灵顿后验。",
