    "translated_abstract": "由于剩余类别的标签不可用，视觉识别任务通常限于处理一小部分类别。我们通过基于有标签和无标签示例的表示学习来识别数据集中的新概念，并将识别扩展到已知和新的类别。为了应对这一具有挑战性的任务，我们提出了一种组合学习方法，该方法使用由多个异质标签空间的监督元分类器给出的组成知识自然地对未见类别中的示例进行聚类。通过无监督的成对关系学习，组合嵌入所提供的表示更加强健。所提出的算法通过联合优化来发现新概念，以增强未见类别的区分性，并学习对新类别具有泛化能力的已知类别的表示。我们广泛的实验展示了我们的方法在各种开放集识别基准测试中的卓越表现，表明了在发现新概念和提高已知和新类别的识别性能方面的有效性。",
