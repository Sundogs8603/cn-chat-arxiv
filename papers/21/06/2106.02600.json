    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个广义线性结构因果模型，并结合一种新颖的数据自适应线性正则化方法，从时间序列中恢复因果有向无环图(DAGs)。通过利用最近开发的随机单调变分不等式(VI)形式，我们将因果发现问题转化为一般的凸优化问题。此外，我们通过解决线性规划问题，建立了一种非渐进性的恢复保证和可量化的不确定性，以确定一系列非线性单调连接函数的置信区间。我们通过广泛的数值实验验证了理论结果的有效性和方法的竞争性能。最重要的是，我们展示了我们的方法在恢复高度可解释的因果DAGs上的有效性，尤其是在Sepsis相关紊乱(SADs)方面，同时实现了与强大的“黑匣子”模型（如XGBoost）相当的预测性能。因此，我们提出的方法在未来进行条件随机场建模和因果推断中的应用具有重要意义。",
