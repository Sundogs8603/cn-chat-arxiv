    "translated_abstract": "现有的组合搜索方法通常复杂且需要一定水平的专业知识。本文介绍了一种简单而高效的深度学习方法，用于解决具有预定义目标的组合问题，其中目标由魔方表示。我们证明，对于这些问题，仅通过对从目标状态开始的随机混乱状态进行深度神经网络训练就足以实现接近最优的解决方案。在 Rubik's Cube、15 Puzzle 和 7×7 Lights Out 测试中，我们的方法优于前沿方法 DeepCubeA，提高了解决方案的最优性和计算成本之间的权衡，尽管所使用的训练数据显著少于前者。此外，我们还研究了与模型大小和训练数据量相关的 Rubik's Cube 解算器的比例定律。",
