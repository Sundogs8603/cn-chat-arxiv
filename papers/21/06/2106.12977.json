Let P be a one-to-one two-sided matching market and let P be its associated normal form, a (weakly) smaller matching market with the same set of stable matchings, that can be obtained using procedures introduced in Irving and Leather (1986) and Balinski and Ratier (1997). The following three statements are equivalent (a) P has a unique stable matching. (b) Preferences on P* are acyclic, as defined by Chung (2000). (c) In P* every market participant's preference list is a singleton.",
