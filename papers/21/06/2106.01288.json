    "translated_abstract": "随着摩尔定律的接近尽头，对计算能力的指数期望正在推动寻求提高整体系统性能的新途径。其中之一是探索旨在实现生物神经处理系统的灵活性和计算效率的替代脑启发式计算体系结构。在这个背景下，神经形态工程代表了一种基于脉冲神经网络体系结构实现的计算的范式转变，在这种形态中，处理和存储被紧密地放置在一起。本文对这一领域进行了全面的概述，突出了实现这种范式转变的不同粒度级别，并比较了专注于复制自然智能（自下而上）与那些旨在解决实际人工智能应用（自上而下）的设计方法。首先，我们介绍了模拟、混合信号和数字电路设计风格，确定了它们之间的差异。其次，我们讨论了神经形态器件模板的物理设计和工艺制造，以及这些工艺制造的异质性和电性能对器件性能和整体系统设计的影响。最后，我们介绍了神经形态工程领域的应用，包括传感器应用、机器感知、低功耗/高效能处理和智能边缘设备应用。",
