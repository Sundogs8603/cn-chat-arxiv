In this work, we investigate a more challenging case where the majority may behave adversarially and the rest behave as the Massart noise - a significant generalization of the perfectness assumption. We show that under the {semi-verified model} of Charikar et al.

Moreover, we show that the labeling cost can be drastically mitigated via the more easily obtained comparison queries. Orthogonal to recent developments in semi-verified or list-decodable learning that crucially rely on data distributional assumptions, our PAC guarantee holds by explori",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了阈值函数的众包PAC学习问题。在一般假设下，只有在有显著比例的工人是完美的情况下，才能确立具有查询效率的算法。本文探讨了更具挑战性的情况——大多数人可能会行事对抗，并且剩下的人会像Massart噪声一样，从而得到了更普遍的打破完美性假设的结果。我们展示了在Charikar等人提出的半验证模型下，只要有(有限的)访问受信任的oracle就能够对基本的假设类进行PAC学习，并且能够在可管理的标签查询量下实现。此外，我们还表明可以通过更容易获得的比较查询来极大地减少标记成本。我们的PAC保证与半验证或列表可解决学习中最近的发展不同，这些发展关键地依赖于数据分布假设。",
