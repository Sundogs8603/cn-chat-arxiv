    "abstract": "One of the key problems in multi-label text classification is how to take advantage of the correlation among labels. However, it is very challenging to directly model the correlations among labels in a complex and unknown label space. In this paper, we propose a Label Mask multi-label text classification model (LM-MTC), which is inspired by the idea of cloze questions of language model. LM-MTC is able to capture implicit relationships among labels through the powerful ability of pre-train language models. On the basis, we assign a different token to each potential label, and randomly mask the token with a certain probability to build a label based Masked Language Model (MLM). We train the MTC and MLM together, further improving the generalization ability of the model. A large number of experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

    "translated_abstract": "在多标签文本分类中，一个关键问题是如何利用标签之间的关联。但是，在一个复杂和未知的标签空间中直接建模标签之间的关联是非常具有挑战性的。在本文中，我们提出了一种 Label Mask 多标签文本分类模型（LM-MTC），它受到语言模型的填空问题思想的启发。LM-MTC 能够通过预训练语言模型的强大能力捕捉标签之间的隐含关系。在此基础上，我们为每个潜在标签分配一个不同的标记，并以一定概率随机遮盖该标记，建立了基于标签的遮掩语言模型（MLM）。我们同时训练 MTC 和 MLM，进一步提高了模型的泛化能力。多个数据集上的大量实验证明了我们方法的有效性。",
