    "translated_abstract": "声学问答（AQA）任务的目标是回答关于声学场景内容的自由文本问题。本文基于之前介绍的CLEAR数据集，提出了一个新的AQA基准，即CLEAR2，它强调了声学输入的特定挑战，包括处理时长变化的场景和在训练集与测试集之间有不同的基本声音构建的场景。我们还介绍了一种名为NAAQA的神经网络结构，它利用了声学输入的特定属性。在时间和频率上使用1D卷积来处理声学内容的2D频谱时域表示，显示出有希望的结果，并能减少模型复杂性。我们展示了时间坐标图可以增加时间定位能力，从而将网络性能提高约17个百分点。另一方面，频率坐标图对网络性能几乎没有影响。",
