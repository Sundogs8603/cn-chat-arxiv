    "translated_abstract": "生成具有潜在使自动驾驶系统失效的对抗情景是提高鲁棒性的有效方法。最近的专用模型扩展了纯数据驱动的生成模型，满足了额外的可控要求，例如通过在神经元级别隐式操作来嵌入交通标志在驾驶场景中。在本文中，我们引入一种方法，在生成过程中显式地融入领域知识，实现语义对抗生成（SAG）。为了与驾驶场景的组成保持一致，我们首先将知识分为两类，即对象的属性和对象之间的关系。然后，我们提出了一种树状变分自动编码器（T-VAE）来学习层次化场景表示。通过对树结构中的节点和边的属性施加语义规则，显式知识融合实现了可控的生成。我们构建了一个合成示例来验证该方法的有效性。",
