    "translated_abstract": "最先进的生成模型能够合成逼真的图像，令人难以区分是真实照片还是生成的图像。识别和理解篡改媒体对于缓解生成模型潜在滥用的社会关切至关重要。我们提出了对生成模型进行逆向工程的方法，从这些模型生成的图像中推断模型的超参数。我们定义了一个新颖的问题，即“模型解析”，通过分析生成的图像来估计生成模型的网络架构和训练损失函数，这对人类而言似乎是不可能的任务。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个框架，包括两个组成部分：指纹估计网络（FEN），通过训练带有四个约束的指纹估计网络来估计生成模型的指纹，以鼓励指纹具有期望的特性；解析网络（PN），从估计的指纹中预测网络架构和损失函数。为了评估我们的方法，我们收集了一些生成模型的图像，并对其进行了推断。",
