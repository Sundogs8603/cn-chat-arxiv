    "abstract": "Sample-and-rank is a key decoding strategy for modern generation-based dialogue systems. It helps achieve diverse and high-quality responses by selecting an answer from a small pool of generated candidates. The current state-of-the-art ranking methods mainly use an encoding paradigm called Cross-Encoder, which separately encodes each context-candidate pair and ranks the candidates according to their fitness scores. However, Cross-Encoder repeatedly encodes the same lengthy context for each candidate, resulting in high computational costs. Poly-Encoder addresses the above problems by reducing the interaction between context and candidates, but with a price of performance drop. In this work, we develop a new paradigm called Uni-Encoder, that keeps the full attention over each pair as in Cross-Encoder while only encoding the context once, as in Poly-Encoder. Uni-Encoder encodes all the candidates with the context in one forward pass. We use the same positional embedding for all candidates",

    "translated_abstract": "样本与排序是现代生成型对话系统的关键解码策略，通过从生成的少量候选答案中选择一个答案来实现多样化和高质量的响应。当前最先进的排序方法主要使用称为交叉编码器的编码范例，该编码器分别对每个上下文-候选对进行编码，并根据其适应度得分对候选进行排序。然而，交叉编码器为每个候选重复编码相同的冗长上下文，导致计算成本高。Poly-Encoder通过减少上下文和候选之间的交互来解决上述问题，但代价是性能下降。在这项工作中，我们开发了一种新的范例，称为Uni-Encoder，它像交叉编码器一样完全关注每个候选对，同时像Poly-编码器一样只编码一次上下文。Uni-Encoder在一次前向传递中对所有候选与上下文进行编码。我们针对所有候选使用相同的位置嵌入。",
