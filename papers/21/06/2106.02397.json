    "translated_abstract": "连续约束满足问题（CCSP）是具有区间域 $U \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ 的约束满足问题（CSP）。我们进行了系统研究，对满足存在性实数理论（ER-complete）的CCSP进行分类。为了定义这个类别，我们首先考虑问题ETR，它也代表存在性实数理论。在这个问题的实例中，我们被给定一个形如 $\\exists x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in \\mathbb{R} : \\Phi(x_1, \\ldots, x_n)$ 的句子，其中 $\\Phi$ 是一个由符号 $\\{0, 1, +, \\cdot, \\geq, >, \\wedge, \\vee, \\neg\\}$ 构成的良好形式的非量化公式，目标是检查这个句子是否为真。现在，类别ER是所有能在多项式时间内归约到ETR的问题的集合。已知 NP $\\subseteq$ ER $\\subseteq$ PSPACE。我们将注意力集中在具有加法约束（$x + y = z$）和其他一些温和技术条件的CCSP上。以前已经证明了一些性质。",
