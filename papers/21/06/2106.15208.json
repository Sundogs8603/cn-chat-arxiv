    "translated_abstract": "在以三项模型为基础的不完全市场中，我们考虑两种投资者：一个是受公共信息驱动的普通代理人，另一个是从一开始就拥有通过一个随机变量编码的额外信息的内部人。通过定义一个基于标记二项过程的辅助模型，我们将三项模型处理为波动性模型，并利用在该背景下可用的随机分析和Malliavin微积分工具箱。特别是，我们通过Malliavin导数的术语在初始扩展过滤中连接信息漂移和消除漂移以保持鞅性质。我们明确解决了代理人和内部人预期对数效用最大化问题，并为可复制要求提供了套期保值公式。我们将内部人预期的额外效用与额外信息的香农熵进行了对应，并进一步审视了外部市场对该内容的依赖程度。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a discrete-time jump process approach to investigate the insider problem in the trinomial model. By using a marked binomial process as an auxiliary model, the trinomial model is handled as a volatility one, and stochastic analysis and Malliavin calculus are employed. The paper explicitly solves the expected utility maximization problems for both the agent and the insider and provides a hedging formula for replicable claims. Furthermore, the paper establishes a connection between the insider's expected additional utility and the Shannon entropy of the extra information."
