    "translated_abstract": "个性化联邦学习（PFL）已经取得了显著的进展，实现了保护训练数据隐私的创新机器学习应用的发展。然而，现有的理论研究主要集中在极小化问题的分布式优化上。本文首次研究了PFL应用于鞍点问题，这种问题涵盖了更广泛的优化问题，需要解决的不仅仅是极小化问题。在这项工作中，我们考虑了最近提出的PFL设置，其中包括混合目标函数的方法，即全局模型学习与本地分布式学习器相结合。与大多数先前的工作只考虑集中式设置不同，我们在一个更一般和分散的设置中工作，这使我们能够设计和分析更实用和联邦化的设备连接方式。我们提出了新的算法来解决这个问题，并提供了理论分析。",
