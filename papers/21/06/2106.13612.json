    "abstract": "We study the link between political influence and industrial concentration. We present a joint model of political influence and market competition: an oligopoly lobbies the government over regulation, and competes in the product market shaped by this influence. We show broad conditions for mergers to increase lobbying, both on the intensive margin and the extensive margin. We combine data on mergers with data on lobbying expenditures and campaign contributions in the US from 1999 to 2017. We document a positive association between mergers and lobbying, both by individual firms and by industry trade associations. Mergers are also associated with extensive margin changes such as the formation of in-house lobbying teams and corporate PACs. We find some evidence for a positive association between mergers and higher campaign contributions.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究政治影响和产业垄断之间的联系。我们提出了一个关于政治影响和市场竞争的联合模型：寡头垄断游说政府进行监管，并在这种影响下的产品市场竞争。我们展示了兼并增加游说的广泛条件，既在密集边际上又在广泛边际上。我们结合了1999年至2017年美国兼并数据和游说开支、竞选捐款数据。我们记录兼并和游说之间的正向关联，无论是个人公司还是行业贸易协会。并且兼并还与类似设立内部游说团队和公司政治行动委员会等广泛边际变化相关。我们发现兼并和更高的竞选捐款之间存在一定的正向关联的证据。",
