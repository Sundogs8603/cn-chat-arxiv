    "translated_abstract": "个体在决策中使用模型作为指导，但很多模型是错误的。本文研究了当个体同时考虑替代模型时，哪些错误的建模可能会持续存在。考虑一个使用模型来学习行动选择和结果关系的代理人。代理人表现出固定模型切换，通过一个阈值规则来捕捉，当替代模型与观察到的数据相比具有足够好的拟合度时，她会切换到替代模型。主要结果基于从学习环境的基本条件中推导出的两个关键特征，即模型在预测观察到的结果平衡模式方面的渐近准确性和先验分布对该平衡的“紧密程度”，给出了模型是否持续存在的刻画。我展示了错误的建模可以是健壮的，即它们对抗各种竞争模型 - 包括正确的模型 - 的存在，并且尽管个体观察到无限数量的数据。",
    "tldr": "本文研究了个体在决策中使用错误的建模的情况下，错配模型能否持续存在的条件。作者通过考虑代理人在观察到数据后是否切换到更好的模型，并分析模型的渐近准确性和先验分布的“紧密程度”，得出了错配模型对抗竞争模型的健壮性结论。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper examines the persistence of misspecified models in decision-making by individuals. The author investigates the conditions under which these models can persist by analyzing the agent's switching behavior and characteristics of the models. The findings suggest that misspecified models can be robust against competing models based on their asymptotic accuracy and the tightness of the prior distribution."
