    "abstract": "Restless and collapsing bandits are often used to model budget-constrained resource allocation in settings where arms have action-dependent transition probabilities, such as the allocation of health interventions among patients. However, state-of-the-art Whittle-index-based approaches to this planning problem either do not consider fairness among arms, or incentivize fairness without guaranteeing it. We thus introduce ProbFair, a probabilistically fair policy that maximizes total expected reward and satisfies the budget constraint while ensuring a strictly positive lower bound on the probability of being pulled at each timestep. We evaluate our algorithm on a real-world application, where interventions support continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy adherence among patients, as well as on a broader class of synthetic transition matrices. We find that ProbFair preserves utility while providing fairness guarantees.",

    "translated_abstract": "在预算受限的资源分配中，常常使用不确定性和崩溃赌博模型来描述具有动作相关转移概率的情境，例如在患者之间分配健康干预措施。然而，针对这个规划问题的最先进的Whittle指数方法要么不考虑赌博之间的公平性，要么在保证公平性时激励公平性。因此，我们引入ProbFair，一种概率公平策略，该策略在满足预算约束的同时，最大化总期望奖励，并确保在每个时间步上被选择的概率具有严格的正下界。我们在实际应用中评估了我们的算法，在这个应用中，介入措施支持患者间持续的正压通气（CPAP）疗法的依从性，以及在更广泛的合成转移矩阵类上进行了评估。我们发现ProbFair在提供公平性保证的同时保持了效用。",
