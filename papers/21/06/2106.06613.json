    "translated_abstract": "在许多协调问题中，独立推理的人类能够发现互相兼容的策略。相反，独立训练的自博弈策略通常是互不兼容的。零知识协调（ZSC）最近被提出作为多智能体强化学习中的一个新前沿，以解决这一基本问题。先前的研究通过假设玩家可以在学习算法上达成一致，但在行动和观测标签上无法达成一致，提出了其他对局作为一种最优解。然而，直到现在，这个“无标签”问题只是被非正式地定义。我们将这种设置形式化为无标签协调（LFC）问题，通过定义无标签协调博弈来解决。我们证明了其他对局不能成为LFC问题的最优解，因为它未能在不兼容的最大化者之间一致地打破平局。我们引入了算法的扩展，即带有打破平局的其他对局，同时证明了它的最优性。",
