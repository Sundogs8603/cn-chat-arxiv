Dot products make a strong transitivity assumption, however, many important forces generating graphs in the real world lead to non-transitive relationships. We remove the transitivity assumption by embedding nodes into a pseudo-Euclidean space - giving each node an attract and a repel vector. The inner product between two nodes is defined by taking the dot product in attract vectors and subtracting the dot product in repel vectors. Pseudo-Euclidean embeddings can compress networks efficiently, allow for multiple notions of nearest neighbors each with their own interpretation, and can be `slotted' into existing models such as exponential family embeddings or graph neural networks for better link prediction.",

    "translated_abstract": "点积嵌入将图构造为节点矢量，使得两个矢量之间的点积给出边的强度。然而，许多在现实世界中生成图形的重要力量导致了非传递关系，我们通过将节点嵌入拟欧几里得空间中来消除传递性假设，给每个节点一个吸引和一个排斥矢量，两个节点之间的内积通过在吸引矢量中进行点积并在排斥矢量中进行点积的结果相减来定义。拟欧几里得嵌入可以高效地压缩网络，允许多种最近邻的概念，每种概念都有自己的解释，并且可以被“插入”到现有的模型中，比如指数族嵌入或图神经网络，以实现更好的链接预测。",
