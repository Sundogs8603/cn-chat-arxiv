    "abstract": "Active labor market programs are important instruments used by European employment agencies to help the unemployed find work. Investigating large administrative data on German long-term unemployed persons, we analyze the effectiveness of three job search assistance and training programs using Causal Machine Learning. Participants benefit from quickly realizing and long-lasting positive effects across all programs, with placement services being the most effective. For women, we find differential effects in various characteristics. Especially, women benefit from better local labor market conditions. We propose more effective data-driven rules for allocating the unemployed to the respective labor market programs that could be employed by decision-makers.",

    "translated_abstract": "积极的劳动力市场计划是欧洲就业机构帮助失业者找工作的重要工具。研究德国长期失业人员的大型行政数据，我们使用因果机器学习分析了三个工作搜索援助和培训计划的有效性。参与者受益于所有计划的快速实现和长期积极影响，其中就业服务是最有效的。对于女性，我们发现各种特征存在差异影响。特别是，女性受益于更好的当地劳动力市场条件。我们建议使用更有效的数据驱动规则，将失业人员分配到相应的劳动力市场计划，这些规则可以被决策者采用。",
    "tldr": "该研究使用因果机器学习分析了德国长期失业人员的三个工作搜索援助和培训计划的有效性，结果显示参与者受益匪浅，其中就业服务效果最好。此外，女性受当地劳动力市场条件的影响有所不同。提出使用数据驱动规则更有效地分配失业人员到相应计划。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study uses causal machine learning to analyze the effectiveness of three job search assistance and training programs for long-term unemployed persons in Germany, finding that participants benefit significantly from placement services, with differential effects observed for women based on local labor market conditions. The study suggests using data-driven rules to allocate unemployment to appropriate labor market programs."
