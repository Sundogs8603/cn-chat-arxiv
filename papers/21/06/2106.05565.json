    "abstract": "This study examines the identifiability of interaction kernels in mean-field equations of interacting particles or agents, an area of growing interest across various scientific and engineering fields. The main focus is identifying data-dependent function spaces where a quadratic loss functional possesses a unique minimizer. We consider two data-adaptive $L^2$ spaces: one weighted by a data-adaptive measure and the other using the Lebesgue measure. In each $L^2$ space, we show that the function space of identifiability is the closure of the RKHS associated with the integral operator of inversion.  Alongside prior research, our study completes a full characterization of identifiability in interacting particle systems with either finite or infinite particles, highlighting critical differences between these two settings. Moreover, the identifiability analysis has important implications for computational practice. It shows that the inverse problem is ill-posed, necessitating regularization.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了相互作用微粒或代理人的平均场方程中相互作用核的可辨识性问题，这是各种科学和工程领域日益关注的领域。主要关注点在于确定数据相关函数空间，其中二次损失函数拥有唯一的最小化器。我们考虑了两个数据自适应的$L^2$空间：一个是由数据自适应权重衡量的，另一个使用勒贝格测度。在每个$L^2$空间中，我们表明可辨识性的函数空间是与求积分算子相关的RKHS闭包。与之前的研究相辅相成，本研究完成了具有有限或无限微粒的相互作用微粒系统的可辨识性的全面描述，突显了这两种情况之间的关键差异。此外，可辨识性分析对于计算实践具有重要影响。它表明反问题是病态的，需要正则化处理。",

The study highlights the critical differences in identifiability between systems with finite or infinite particles and stresses the importance of regularization in computational practice due to ill-posed inverse problems."
