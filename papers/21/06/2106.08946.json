    "translated_abstract": "智能手机上的细粒度位置预测可以用于改进应用程序/系统性能。 应用场景包括根据预测用户位置的5G网络质量自适应视频质量，以及基于预测用户位置加速内容渲染的增强现实应用程序。 这些用例要求预测误差与GPS误差相同，并且目前在位置预测方面没有任何现有工作可以实现这种精度水平。我们提出了一种基于手机上收集的GPS轨迹的移动用户的细粒度位置预测系统（FGLP）。 FGLP有两个组件：联邦学习框架和预测模型。 该框架在用户的手机上以及在协调系统中的所有用户的服务器上运行学习。 FGLP将用户位置数据表示为抽象2D空间中的相对点，这使得可以跨不同的物理空间进行学习。 该模型合并了双向长短期记忆（BiLSTM）和卷积神经网络（CNN）以捕获GPS轨迹中的时间和空间模式。 仿真结果表明，FGLP实现了8米的预测精度，这与GPS误差相当，同时将数据发送开销降低了两个数量级，相对于集中式系统。",

    "en_tdlr": "FGLP is a system composed of a federated learning framework and a prediction model, which abstracts GPS traces collected on smartphones as relative points in 2D space, merges BiLSTM and CNN to capture temporal and spatial patterns, achieves a prediction accuracy of 8 meters comparable to GPS error, and reduces data sending overhead by two orders of magnitude compared to a centralized system."
