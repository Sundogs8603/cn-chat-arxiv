The networks of interest may be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted, and may have distinct vertex sets of different sizes. Given two networks and a cost function relating their vertices, NetOTC finds a transition coupling of their associated random walks having minimum expected cost. The minimizing cost quantifies the difference between the networks, while the optimal transport plan itself provides alignments of both the vertices and the edges of the two networks. Coupling of the full random walks, rather than their marginal distributions, ensures that NetOTC captures local and global information about the networks, and preserves edges. NetOTC has no free parameters, and does not rely on randomization. We investigate a number of theoretical properties of NetOTC and present experiments establishing its empirical performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们描述并研究了一种基于传输的过程，称为NetOTC（网络优化转换耦合），用于比较和对齐两个网络。所研究的网络可以是有向或无向的，带权重或不带权重，并且可能具有不同大小的不同顶点集。给定两个网络和一个与它们的顶点相关的成本函数，NetOTC找到其随机行走的转换耦合，使其具有最小的期望成本。最小化的成本量化了网络之间的差异，而最佳传输计划本身提供了两个网络的顶点和边的对齐。通过耦合完整的随机行走，而不是它们的边缘分布，确保NetOTC捕捉到了关于网络的局部和全局信息，并保留了边缘。NetOTC没有自由参数，并且不依赖随机化。我们研究了NetOTC的一些理论特性，并进行了一些实验证明其实际性能。",
