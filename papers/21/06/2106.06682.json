    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于扩散映射和深度学习的无网格计算框架和机器学习理论，用于在未知流形上解椭圆型PDE问题，其中流形用点云表示。PDE求解器被形式化为一个监督学习任务，以解决一个最小二乘回归问题，该问题通过近似表示一个PDE（以及边界条件，如果适用）的代数方程。这个代数方程涉及到通过扩散映射渐进展开得到的图拉普拉斯矩阵，它是一个关于二阶椭圆微分算子的一致估计量。最终得到的数值方法是解决一个高度非凸的经验风险最小化问题，该问题限制在神经网络假设空间的解空间内。在良定义的椭圆型PDE设置中，当假设空间包括无限宽度或深度的神经网络时，我们证明经验损失函数的全局最小值是极限情况下的一致解。",
