    "abstract": "Detecting and responding to novel situations in open-world environments is a key capability of human cognition and is a persistent problem for AI systems. In an open-world, novelties can appear in many different forms and may be easy or hard to detect. Therefore, to accurately evaluate the novelty detection capability of AI systems, it is necessary to investigate how difficult it may be to detect different types of novelty. In this paper, we propose a qualitative physics-based method to quantify the difficulty of novelty detection focusing on open-world physical domains. We apply our method in the popular physics simulation game Angry Birds, and conduct a user study across different novelties to validate our method. Results indicate that our calculated detection difficulties are in line with those of human users.",

    "translated_abstract": "在开放世界环境中识别和响应新奇情况是人类认知的一个关键能力，也是人工智能系统面临的持久性问题。在开放世界中，新奇性可以呈现多种形式，也可能很容易或很难被检测到。因此，为了准确评估人工智能系统的新奇性检测能力，有必要研究不同类型新奇性的检测难度。本文提出了一种基于定性物理方法来量化开放世界物理领域中新颖性检测困难度的方法。我们将此方法应用于流行的物理模拟游戏愤怒的小鸟，并进行了针对不同新奇性的用户研究以验证我们的方法。结果表明，我们计算的检测困难度与人类用户的相符合。",
