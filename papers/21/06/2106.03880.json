    "translated_abstract": "最近的很多研究开始探索参数化量子电路（PQC）作为机器学习模型，在混合量子经典优化框架下的潜力。特别地，关于这些模型的样本外性能的理论保证，即泛化界限，已经出现。然而，这些泛化界限中没有一个明确地取决于用于将经典输入数据编码到PQC中的策略。我们推导了基于PQC的模型的泛化界限，这些界限明确地取决于用于数据编码的策略。这些界限是对训练过的PQC模型在未知数据上性能的限制。此外，我们的结果通过结构风险最小化，即一种数学严格的模型选择框架，促进了最佳数据编码策略的选择。我们通过限制PQC-based模型的复杂度来获得我们的泛化界限，该复杂度由Rademacher复杂度和度量熵两个复杂度度量组成。",
