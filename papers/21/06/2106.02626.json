    "translated_abstract": "长期以来，人们一直认为大脑在结构和功能上高度模块化，但最近的证据使一些人对两种模块化的程度产生了怀疑。我们使用人工神经网络来测试结构模块化是否足以保证功能专业化，并发现一般情况下，并不一定成立，除非在极端水平上。然后，我们系统地测试了环境和网络的哪些特征会导致专业化的出现。我们使用了一个简单的玩具环境、任务和网络，以精确控制条件，并表明在这个设置中，几个不同的专业化度量指标给出了类似的结果。我们进一步发现，（1）专业化只能在环境中那些可以明确分离的特征存在的情况下出现，（2）专业化更容易在网络资源受到强烈限制的情况下出现，（3）这些发现在 qualitatively 上相似。",
    "tldr": "本研究使用人工神经网络模拟实验，发现结构模块化并不一定能够确保功能专业化，在特定环境和资源限制下，才能够出现专业化现象。",
