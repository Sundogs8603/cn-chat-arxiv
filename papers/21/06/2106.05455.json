    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络(GNNs)已经被广泛应用于各种图挖掘任务。然而，最近的研究揭示了在经过训练的GNN中学到的权重(通道)是高度冗余的，这不可避免地限制了GNN的性能。我们的目标不是为了效率考虑而移除这些冗余通道，而是试图重新激活它们，以扩大GNN的表示能力，实现有效的图学习。本文提出了一种名为AKE-GNN的新型GNN学习框架，它通过对图增强生成的多个图视图之间进行自适应知识交换策略来实现这个目标。AKE-GNN首先训练多个GNN，每个对应一个图视图，以获得信息通道。然后，AKE-GNN迭代地以逐层方式在一个GNN的权重参数矩阵中进行冗余通道与另一个GNN的信息通道之间的交换。",
