    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation aims to leverage users' historical behaviors to predict their next interaction. Existing works have not yet addressed two main challenges in sequential recommendation. First, user behaviors in their rich historical sequences are often implicit and noisy preference signals, they cannot sufficiently reflect users' actual preferences. In addition, users' dynamic preferences often change rapidly over time, and hence it is difficult to capture user patterns in their historical sequences. In this work, we propose a graph neural network model called SURGE (short for SeqUential Recommendation with Graph neural nEtworks) to address these two issues. Specifically, SURGE integrates different types of preferences in long-term user behaviors into clusters in the graph by re-constructing loose item sequences into tight item-item interest graphs based on metric learning. This helps explicitly distinguish users' core interests, by forming dense clusters in the interest graph.",

    "translated_abstract": "顺序推荐旨在利用用户的历史行为预测他们的下一次互动。现有的工作在顺序推荐中面临两个主要挑战。首先，用户的行为在他们丰富的历史序列中常常是隐式和嘈杂的偏好信号，无法充分反映用户的实际偏好。另外，用户的动态偏好往往会随时间迅速变化，因此很难捕捉到他们历史序列中的用户模式。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为SURGE（SeqUential Recommendation with Graph neural networks）的图神经网络模型来应对这两个问题。具体而言，SURGE通过基于度量学习，将长期用户行为中不同类型的偏好重新构造为紧密的物品-物品兴趣图中的聚类，从而帮助明确区分用户的核心兴趣。聚类在兴趣图中形成了密集的集群。",
