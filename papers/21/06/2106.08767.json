    "abstract": "There is a parameter ubiquitous throughout the deep learning world: learning rate. There is likewise a ubiquitous question: what should that learning rate be? The true answer to this question is often tedious and time consuming to obtain, and a great deal of arcane knowledge has accumulated in recent years over how to pick and modify learning rates to achieve optimal training performance. Moreover, the long hours spent carefully crafting the perfect learning rate can come to nothing the moment your network architecture, optimizer, dataset, or initial conditions change ever so slightly. But it need not be this way. We propose a new answer to the great learning rate question: the Autonomous Learning Rate Controller. Find it at https://github.com/fastestimator/ARC/tree/v2.0",

    "translated_abstract": "学习率是深度学习领域中无处不在的参数。同时也存在一个普遍的问题：学习率应该设置为多少？然而，这个问题的真正答案通常是琐碎且耗时的，并且近年来积累了大量关于如何选择和修改学习率以实现最佳训练性能的深奥知识。此外，花费数小时精心调整学习率的努力可能会因为网络架构、优化器、数据集或初始条件微小的改变而化为乌有。但事实上，我们可以改变这种情况。我们提出了一个新的答案来解决这个重要的学习率问题：自主学习率控制器。",
    "tldr": "自主学习率控制器是一个解决深度学习中学习率设置问题的新方法，旨在避免耗时且琐碎的选择和修改过程，以及对网络架构、优化器、数据集和初始条件的微小变化的敏感性。",
    "en_tdlr": "The Autonomous Learning Rate Controller is a new approach to solving the learning rate setting problem in deep learning, aiming to avoid the tedious and time-consuming process of selection and modification, as well as the sensitivity to minor changes in network architecture, optimizer, dataset, and initial conditions."
