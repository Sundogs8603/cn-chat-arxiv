    "translated_abstract": "在固定预算设置下的最佳臂识别（BAI）是一个赌博机问题，学习代理在固定观测次数后最大化识别出最优（最佳）臂的概率。大多数关于该主题的研究都是针对非结构化问题，并且臂的数量较少，这限制了它们的适用性。我们提出了一种通用易处理的算法，通过从联合广义模型中基于均值奖励估计逐步消除次优臂来引入结构化。我们在线性模型和广义线性模型（GLM）中分析了我们的算法，并提出了基于G-最优设计的实际实现方法。在线性模型中，我们的算法在错误保证方面与先前的工作相比具有竞争力，并在经验上至少表现得不错。在GLM中，这是第一个具有固定预算BAI分析的实用算法。",
