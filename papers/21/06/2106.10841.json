    "abstract": "Non-unitary household models posit that increasing women's bargaining power can affect child health, a significant predictor of human capital and economic status throughout adulthood. We study how a policy change, the Hindu Succession Act Amendment (HSAA), which provided inheritance rights to unmarried women in India, impacts child health. We find evidence that the HSAA improved the height and weight of children. In addition, we find evidence consistent with a channel that the policy improved women's intra-household bargaining power, leading to downstream benefits through better parental care for children and improved child health. The findings confirm that children do better when their mothers control a more significant fraction of the family resources. Thus, policies that empower women can have additional positive spillovers for children's human capital.",

    "translated_abstract": "非单元家庭模型认为，增加妇女的谈判能力可以影响儿童的健康状况，这是影响成年后人力资本和经济地位的重要预测因素。我们研究了一个政策变化：印度《印度教继承法》修正案（Hindu Succession Act Amendment，HSAA），该修正案为未婚妇女提供了继承权，对儿童健康状况产生影响。我们发现，HSAA改善了儿童的身高和体重。此外，我们发现，该政策改善了妇女在家庭内的谈判能力，通过更好的父母照料和改善的儿童健康状况产生了下游效益。研究结果证实，当母亲控制更大比例的家庭资源时，儿童的情况更好。因此，赋予妇女权力的政策可以对儿童的人力资本产生额外积极溢出效应。",
