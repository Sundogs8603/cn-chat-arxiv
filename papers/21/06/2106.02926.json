    "translated_abstract": "由于复杂网络的结构通常是未知的，我们可以通过探索底层网络的一部分来确定具有最大影响力的种子节点，给定节点查询的小预算。我们提出了IM-META，一种解决在未知拓扑网络中影响最大化（IM）问题的方法，通过从查询和节点元数据中检索信息。由于使用这样的元数据并不是没有风险，因为元数据的噪声特性和连通性推断的不确定性，我们制定了一个新的IM问题，旨在找到种子节点和查询节点。在IM-META中，我们开发了一个有效的方法，通过以下三个步骤迭代进行：1）我们通过孪生神经网络学习收集到的元数据与边的关系，2）我们选择一定数量的推断出的可信边来构建一个增强图，3）我们通过使用我们的拓扑感知排序策略，通过最大化推断的影响扩散来确定下一个要查询的节点。通过对IM-META的实验评估，我们证明了其有效性。",
