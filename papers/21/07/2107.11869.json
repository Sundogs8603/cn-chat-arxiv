    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了两种基于数据驱动的方法，用于非参数模型中使用工具变量的最优估计和推断。第一种是对一类常用筛选两阶段最小二乘估计量的筛选维数的数据驱动选择。当使用该选择进行实现时，结构函数$h_0$及其导数（如弹性）的估计器以最快的（即最小化）超范数收敛速度收敛。第二种是构建用于$h_0$及其导数的均匀置信带（UCBs）。我们的UCBs在一个通用的数据生成过程类别上保证了覆盖，并以最小化速率收缩，可能有对数因子。因此，与通常的欠平滑方法的UCBs相比，我们的UCBs在渐近上具有更高的效率。作为应用，我们评估了国际贸易的垄断竞争模型中企业出口的密集边际的弹性。模拟结果显示了我们方法的良好性能。",
