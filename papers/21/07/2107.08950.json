    "abstract": "Income inequality estimators are biased in small samples, leading generally to an underestimation. This aspect deserves particular attention when estimating inequality in small domains and performing small area estimation at the area level. We propose a bias correction framework for a large class of inequality measures comprising the Gini Index, the Generalized Entropy and the Atkinson index families by accounting for complex survey designs. The proposed methodology does not require any parametric assumption on income distribution, being very flexible. Design-based performance evaluation of our proposal has been carried out using EU-SILC data, their results show a noticeable bias reduction for all the measures. Lastly, an illustrative example of application in small area estimation confirms that ignoring ex-ante bias correction determines model misspecification.",

    "translated_abstract": "在小样本中，收入不平等估计存在偏差，通常导致低估。当在小领域内估计不平等性并在区域水平上进行小区域估计时，这一方面值得特别关注。我们提出了一个偏差校正框架，适用于包括基尼系数、广义熵和阿特金森指数家族在内的大类不平等性测量，同时考虑复杂的抽样设计。所提出的方法不需要对收入分布进行任何参数假设，非常灵活。我们使用 EU-SILC 数据对我们的提议进行了基于设计的性能评估，结果显示所有指标的明显偏差减少。最后，一个在小区域估计中应用的说明性例子确认忽略先前的偏差校正决定了模型规范不足。",
