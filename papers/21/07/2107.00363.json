    "abstract": "arXiv:2107.00363v4 Announce Type: replace-cross  Abstract: Over the last few decades, various methods have been proposed for estimating prediction intervals in regression settings, including Bayesian methods, ensemble methods, direct interval estimation methods and conformal prediction methods. An important issue is the calibration of these methods: the generated prediction intervals should have a predefined coverage level, without being overly conservative. In this work, we review the above four classes of methods from a conceptual and experimental point of view. Results on benchmark data sets from various domains highlight large fluctuations in performance from one data set to another. These observations can be attributed to the violation of certain assumptions that are inherent to some classes of methods. We illustrate how conformal prediction can be used as a general calibration procedure for methods that deliver poor results without a calibration step.",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去几十年中，针对回归设置提出了各种方法来估计预测区间，包括贝叶斯方法、集成方法、直接区间估计方法和符合预测方法。一个重要问题是这些方法的校准：生成的预测区间应该具有预定义的覆盖水平，而不应该过于保守。在这项工作中，我们从概念和实验角度回顾了上述四类方法。来自各个领域的基准数据集的结果突显出在数据集之间的性能有很大波动。这些观察结果可归因于某些类方法固有假设的违背。我们阐述了如何将符合预测用作没有校准步骤会产生差结果的方法的通用校准过程。",
