    "translated_abstract": "推断经济状况的不确定性对于决策者和市场参与者都具有重要意义。本文提出了一种利用隐马尔可夫模型(HMM)测量经济不确定性的新方法。我们构建了一个无量纲指数，经济状况不确定性(ECU)指数，其范围从零到一，可在不同行业、地区和时期进行比较。我们使用2018年至2020年上海市18000多家企业的日用电量数据构建了ECU指数。结果表明，无论是在行业还是在地区层面上，所有的ECU指数都成功捕捉到了COVID-19对上海经济状况的负面影响。此外，ECU指数还展现了不同地区和不同行业的异质性。这反映了经济状况不确定性的变化主要与区域经济结构和行业面临的有针对性的监管政策有关。",
