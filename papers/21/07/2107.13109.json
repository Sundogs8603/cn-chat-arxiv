    "abstract": "With the recent rapid progress in the study of deep generative models (DGMs), there is a need for a framework that can implement them in a simple and generic way. In this research, we focus on two features of DGMs: (1) deep neural networks are encapsulated by probability distributions, and (2) models are designed and learned based on an objective function. Taking these features into account, we propose a new Python library to implement DGMs called Pixyz. This library adopts a step-by-step implementation method with three APIs, which allows us to implement various DGMs more concisely and intuitively. In addition, the library introduces memoization to reduce the cost of duplicate computations in DGMs to speed up the computation. We demonstrate experimentally that this library is faster than existing probabilistic programming languages in training DGMs.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着深度生成模型（DGMs）研究的快速进展，需要一个能够以简单且通用的方式实现它们的框架。本研究关注DGMs的两个特点：（1）深度神经网络被概率分布所封装，（2）模型是基于目标函数进行设计和学习的。考虑到这些特点，我们提出了一个名为Pixyz的新的Python库来实现DGMs。该库采用逐步实现方法，具有三个API，可以更简洁直观地实现各种DGMs。此外，该库引入了记忆化技术，以减少DGMs中重复计算的成本，加快计算速度。我们通过实验证明，与现有的概率编程语言相比，该库在训练DGMs时速度更快。",
