In addition to complementarity/substitution between native and non-native workers, we explore how immigration affects the relative prices of final goods and wages. An application to Italy reveals a positive contribution of immigrants to GDP, public revenues, and the per capita provision of public goods. Employers and employees in the high-skilled-intensive market are winners, while losers are employers in the low-skilled-intensive market. The effects on low-skilled employees are instead inconclusive.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个通用均衡搜索和匹配模型中低技能移民的影响，其中有生产中间产品的异质工人，这些产品用于生产两种最终产品。除了本地工人和非本地工人之间的互补性/替代性，我们还探讨了移民如何影响最终产品的相对价格和工资。对意大利的一个应用显示出移民对国内生产总值、公共收入以及人均提供的公共商品有积极贡献。高技能密集型市场的雇主和雇员是赢家，而低技能密集型市场的雇主是输家。而对低技能员工的影响则并不明确。",
