    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the robustness and sensitivity of various continuous-time rough Volterra stochastic volatility models in relation to the process of market calibration. Model robustness is examined from two perspectives: the sensitivity of option price estimates and the sensitivity of parameter estimates to changes in the option data structure. The following sensitivity analysis consists of statistical tests to determine whether a given studied model is sensitive to changes in the option data structure based on the distribution of parameter estimates. Empirical study is performed on a data set consisting of Apple Inc. equity options traded on four different days in April and May 2015. In particular, the results for RFSV, rBergomi and $\\alpha$RFSV models are provided and compared to the results for Heston, Bates, and AFSVJD models.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了各种连续时间粗糙Volterra随机波动模型在市场校准过程中的鲁棒性和敏感性。从期权价格估计和参数估计对期权数据结构变化的敏感性两个角度考虑模型的鲁棒性。进一步，进行敏感性分析，通过统计检验来确定研究模型是否对期权结构变化敏感，基于参数估计分布进行分析。针对由2015年4月和5月苹果公司股票期权交易形成的数据集进行了实证研究，特别提供了RFSV、rBergomi和αRFSV模型的结果并与Heston、Bates和AFSVJD模型的结果进行了比较。",
