    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了差分评论家生成对抗网络（DiCGAN），用于学习用户所需数据的分布。当只有部分数据集具有所需特性时，DiCGAN可以生成满足用户期望的所需数据，并帮助设计具有所需属性的生物产品。现有方法首先选择所需样本，然后在选定的样本上训练常规GAN以获取用户所需数据分布。然而，所需数据的选择依赖于全局知识和对整个数据集的监督。DiCGAN引入了差分评论家，该评论家从成对偏好中学习，这是本地知识，并且可以定义在部分训练数据上。评论家通过在Wasserstein GAN的评论家上定义额外的排名损失来构建。它赋予每对样本间评论家值的差异以用户偏好，引导所需数据的生成，而不是简单的克隆全局统计信息。",
