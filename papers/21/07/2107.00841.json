    "translated_abstract": "多跳机器阅读理解是自然语言处理中一项具有挑战性的任务，因为它需要在多个文档之间进行更多的推理能力。基于图卷积网络的谱模型展现了良好的推理能力，并取得了竞争性的结果。然而，一些模型的分析和推理与人类的不一致。受认知神经科学中祖母细胞的概念启发，我们提出了一种名为ClueReader的异构图注意力网络模型，来模拟祖母细胞的概念。该模型旨在将多级表示中的语义特征组合起来，并通过注意机制自动集中或减轻信息以进行推理。ClueReader的命名是对模型模式的隐喻：它将查询的主题视为线索的起点，将推理实体视为桥梁点，将潜在候选实体视为祖母细胞，线索结束之后进行推理。",
