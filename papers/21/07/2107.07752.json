    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的定量磁敏感映射（QSM）近年来表现出巨大的潜力，与传统的非学习方法获得类似的结果。许多当前的深度学习方法不是数据一致的，需要体内训练数据或者将QSM问题分为连续的步骤来解决，从而导致错误的传播。本文旨在克服这些限制，并开发了一个框架来联合解决QSM处理步骤。我们开发了一种新的混合训练数据生成方法，可以通过变分网络将QSM模型项和学习的正则化项结合起来，以数据一致的方式进行背景场校正和偶极翻转的端到端训练。我们证明了NeXtQSM克服了先前深度学习方法的限制。NeXtQSM提供了一种新的基于深度学习的流水线，用于计算定量磁敏感映射，将每个处理步骤整合到训练中，并提供结果。",
