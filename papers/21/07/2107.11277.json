    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型总是做出预测，即使可能是不准确的。在许多决策支持应用中，应避免这种行为，因为错误可能带来严重后果。尽管在1970年已经研究过，但近年来机器学习中的拒绝选项引起了人们的关注。这个机器学习子领域使得机器学习模型能够在可能犯错误时避免做出预测。本调查旨在提供机器学习中拒绝选项的概述。我们介绍了导致两种拒绝情况（模糊和新奇拒绝）的条件，并对其进行了仔细的形式化。此外，我们还回顾和分类了评估模型预测和拒绝质量的策略。此外，我们定义了现有的带有拒绝选项的模型架构，并描述了学习这些模型的标准技术。最后，我们提供了相关应用领域的示例，并展示了机器学习中的拒绝选项与其他机器学习方法之间的关系。",
