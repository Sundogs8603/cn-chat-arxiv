    "translated_abstract": "我们探索了改进生成对抗模仿学习（GAIL）算法对观测噪声的鲁棒性的方法。为了实现这个目标，我们研究了鉴别器和生成器的局部Lipschitz性质对GAIL学习的策略鲁棒性的影响。在许多机器人应用中，由于环境观测可能受到噪声的影响，GAIL学到的策略在测试时通常表现下降。因此，对抗观测噪声的学习策略具有重要意义。为此，我们提出了一种正则化方法，引入局部Lipschitz性质到生成器和鉴别器的对抗模仿学习方法中。我们证明修改后的目标导致学习到更加鲁棒的策略。此外，我们理论上和实验上证明了训练一个局部Lipschitz鉴别器会导致一个局部Lipschitz生成器，从而改善了生成对抗模仿学习的性能。",
