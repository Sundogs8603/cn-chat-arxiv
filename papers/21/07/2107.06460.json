    "abstract": "We propose a general family of piecewise hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (PHARA) utilities, including many classic and non-standard utilities as examples. A typical application is the composition of a HARA preference and a piecewise linear payoff in asset allocation. We derive a unified closed-form formula of the optimal portfolio, which is a four-term division. The formula has clear economic meanings, reflecting the behavior of risk aversion, risk seeking, loss aversion and first-order risk aversion. We conduct a general asymptotic analysis to the optimal portfolio, which directly serves as an analytical tool for financial analysis. We compare this PHARA portfolio with those of other utility families both analytically and numerically. One main finding is that risk-taking behaviors are greatly increased by non-concavity and reduced by non-differentiability of the PHARA utility. Finally, we use financial data to test the performance of the PHARA portfolio in the market.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种通用的分段双曲线绝对风险厌恶（PHARA）效用函数家族，包括许多经典和非标准的效用函数作为例子。一个典型的应用是在资产配置中组合HARA偏好和分段线性支付。我们推导出了最优组合的统一闭式公式，该公式是一个四项分式。该公式具有明确的经济意义，反映了风险厌恶、风险寻求、损失厌恶和一阶风险厌恶的行为。我们对最优组合进行了一般性的渐近分析，直接作为金融分析的分析工具。我们在理论上和数值上将这个PHARA组合与其他效用函数家族进行了比较。其中一个主要发现是，非凸性显著增加了风险承担行为，而非可微性则减少了对PHARA效用的风险承担行为。最后，我们使用金融数据来测试PHARA组合在市场中的表现。",
