    "abstract": "In the context of visual navigation, the capacity to map a novel environment is necessary for an agent to exploit its observation history in the considered place and efficiently reach known goals. This ability can be associated with spatial reasoning, where an agent is able to perceive spatial relationships and regularities, and discover object characteristics. Recent work introduces learnable policies parametrized by deep neural networks and trained with Reinforcement Learning (RL). In classical RL setups, the capacity to map and reason spatially is learned end-to-end, from reward alone. In this setting, we introduce supplementary supervision in the form of auxiliary tasks designed to favor the emergence of spatial perception capabilities in agents trained for a goal-reaching downstream objective. We show that learning to estimate metrics quantifying the spatial relationships between an agent at a given location and a goal to reach has a high positive impact in Multi-Object Navigation",

    "translated_abstract": "在视觉导航的背景下，映射新颖环境的能力对于智能体利用所观察到的历史信息，高效地到达已知目标是必要的。这种能力与空间推理有关，智能体能够感知空间关系和规律，发现物体特征。最近的工作引入了可学习的，由深度神经网络参数化的政策，并通过强化学习进行训练。在传统的强化学习设置中，空间制图和推理的能力仅仅从奖励中进行端到端的学习。在这个设置中，我们引入了辅助任务的补充监督形式，旨在促进为实现目标导向下游任务而训练的智能体中出现空间感知能力的产生。我们表明，在学习估计一个智能体与达到目标之间的空间关系指标方面，在多对象导航中具有高度积极的影响。",
