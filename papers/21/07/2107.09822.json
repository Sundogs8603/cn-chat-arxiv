    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种名为贝叶斯控制器融合 (BCF) 的混合控制策略，将传统手工控制器和基于模型的深度强化学习 (RL) 的优点结合起来。BCF 在机器人领域中获得了成功，在许多任务中都存在可靠但次优的控制先验知识，但从头开始进行RL仍然不安全且数据低效。通过融合每个系统的具有不确定性的分布输出，BCF 在它们之间仲裁控制，并利用它们各自的优势。我们在两个现实世界的机器人任务中研究了BCF，这些任务涉及在广阔而长时间的环境中导航，以及一个涉及操作灵活性最大化的复杂抓取任务。对于这两个域，存在简单的手工控制器，可以以风险规避的方式解决手头的任务，但并不一定呈现出最佳解决方案，这是由于分析建模的限制、控制器调整不精确和任务的变化。由于先验在早期阶段自然地指导探索，因此BCF构成了一个马尔科夫决策过程，从而避免了RL从头开始可能面临的问题。",
