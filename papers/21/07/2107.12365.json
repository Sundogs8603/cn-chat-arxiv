    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了如何在高维度中构建主成分分析（PCA）的置信区间，这是一个广泛未被探索的问题。在高维度中计算非线性/非凸估计量的不确定性度量通常是困难的，而这一挑战更加复杂，因为缺失数据和异方差噪声普遍存在。我们提出了一种新颖的方法，用于在带有缺失数据的尖峰协方差模型下对主子空间进行有效推断，基于一种名为HeteroPCA的估计量（Zhang等人，2022年）。我们为HeteroPCA开发了非渐近分布保证，并展示了如何利用这些保证来计算主子空间的置信区间以及尖峰协方差矩阵的条目置信区间。我们的推断程序完全是数据驱动的，并且能够适应异方差随机噪声，而无需先验要求。",
