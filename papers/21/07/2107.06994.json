    "translated_abstract": "神经网络长期以来被用来模拟人类智能，捕捉行为和认知的元素及其神经基础。 深度学习的最新进展使得神经网络模型在许多方面达到甚至超过人类的智能水平，然而与人类不同的是，它们快速学习新任务的能力仍然是一个挑战。人们不仅可以在熟悉的领域进行推理，而且还可以快速学习推理新问题和情况，这就引发了一个问题：现代神经网络模型如何捕捉人类智能以及它们的哪些方面与人类不同。在这项工作中，我们通过研究成年人从一个基于数独的抽象推理任务的简要教学中学习的能力、通过解释性反馈纠正错误答案和狭窄范围的训练示例，来探讨这个差距。我们发现，掌握该任务的参与者可以在少数几次试验中实现，并可以推广到训练范围外的谜题。我们的结果突出了在人工智能系统中实现人类学习机制的重要性。",
