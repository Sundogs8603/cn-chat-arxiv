While the use of knowledge graphs for distant supervision in NLP tasks is well researched, using knowledge graphs for applications like case similarity presents challenges. In this work, we describe our solution for predicting similar cases in Indian court judgements. We present our results and also discuss the impact of large language models on this task.",
