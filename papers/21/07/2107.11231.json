    "translated_abstract": "在统计机器学习中，优化任务至关重要。近年来，人们广泛利用动力系统的工具，通过连续时间系统的适当离散化，导出加速和鲁棒性优化方法。然而，这些思想大多局限于欧几里得空间和无约束的设置，或者Riemannian梯度流。在本文中，我们提出了一种耗散型的Dirac约束哈密顿系统扩展，作为解决平滑流形上的优化问题的通用框架，包括具有非线性约束的问题。我们在流形上开发了几何/辛数值积分器，它们是\"速率匹配\"的，即保持连续时间的收敛速率。特别是，我们介绍了一种耗散型的RATTLE积分器，能够在局部实现最优收敛速率。我们的类别（加速的）算法不仅简单高效，而且适用于广泛的环境。",
