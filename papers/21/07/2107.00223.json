As our main result, we prove that any threshold circuit $C$ of size $s$, depth $d$, energy $e$ and weight $w$ satisfies $\\log (rk(M_C)) \\le ed (\\log s + \\log w + \\log n)$, where $rk(M_C)$ is the rank of the communication matrix $M_C$ of a $2n$-variable Boolean function that $C$ computes. Thus, such a threshold circuit $C$ is able to compute only a Boolean function of which communication matrix has rank bounded by a product of logarithmic factors of $s,w$ and linear factors of $d,e$.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了阈值电路和其他神经网络理论模型的计算能力，以以下四个复杂度度量为基础：大小（门数量）、深度、权重和能量。其中电路的能量复杂度衡量了它们计算的稀疏性，并被定义为在所有输入分配中产生非零值的门的最大数量。作为我们的主要结果，我们证明了任何大小为$s$，深度为$d$，能量为$e$，权重为$w$的阈值电路$C$满足$\\log(rk(M_C)) \\le ed (\\log s + \\log w + \\log n)$，其中$rk(M_C)$是$C$计算的一个$2n$变量布尔函数的通信矩阵$M_C$的秩。因此，这样的阈值电路$C$只能计算具有通信矩阵的秩受到$w$和$d,e$的对数因子和$s$的线性因子的限制的布尔函数。这意味着甚至子线性深度的阈值电路的大小存在指数下界。",
