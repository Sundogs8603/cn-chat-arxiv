We quantify font shapes by constructing embeddings from a deep convolutional neural network. Each embedding maps a font's shape onto a low-dimensional vector.

    "translated_abstract": "许多差异化产品具有关键属性，这些属性是非结构化的，因此是高维的（例如设计，文本）。本文提出了一个分析框架，考虑了一个最简单的设计产品 - 字体，研究了合并和产品差异化，使用了来自全球最大在线字体市场的原始数据集。我们通过从深度卷积神经网络构建嵌入来量化字体形状。每个嵌入将字体的形状映射到低维向量上。在得到的产品空间中，设计师被假设进行Hotelling类型的空间竞争。从图像嵌入中，我们构建了两种捕捉设计差异程度的替代度量。然后我们研究了因果效应。",
