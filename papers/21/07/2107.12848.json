    "abstract": "We present evidence that the word entropy of American English has been rising steadily since around 1900, contrary to predictions from existing sociolinguistic theories. We also find differences in word entropy between media categories, with short-form media such as news and magazines having higher entropy than long-form media, and social media feeds having higher entropy still. To explain these results we develop an ecological model of the attention economy that combines ideas from Zipf's law and information foraging. In this model, media consumers maximize information utility rate taking into account the costs of information search, while media producers adapt to technologies that reduce search costs, driving them to generate higher entropy content in increasingly shorter formats.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提供了证据表明自1900年左右起，美式英语的词汇熵值一直在稳步上升，这与现有社会语言学理论的预测相反。我们还发现，不同媒体之间存在着词汇熵值上的差异，短格式媒体如新闻和杂志的熵值比长格式媒体更高，而社交媒体的熵值则更高。为了解释这些结果，我们提出了一种注意力经济生态模型，结合了Zipf定律和信息搜寻的思想。在该模型中，媒体消费者在考虑信息检索成本的同时，最大化信息效用率，而媒体生产者则适应减少检索成本的技术，推动他们生成越来越短的更高熵值的内容。",
