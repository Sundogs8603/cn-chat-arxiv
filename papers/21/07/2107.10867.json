    "translated_abstract": "参数空间缩减已被证明是加速许多数值任务执行的关键工具，例如优化、逆问题、敏感性分析和代理模型设计，特别是在存在高维参数化系统时。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种名为局部主动子空间（LAS）的新方法，它探索了主动子空间与监督聚类技术的协同作用，以在参数空间中进行更有效的维度缩减。通过引入由全局主动子空间引起的距离度量，聚类是在不丢失输入输出关系的情况下执行的。我们提出了两种可能的聚类算法：K-medoids和一种自上而下的层次方法，该方法能够施加一系列特别为参数空间缩减任务量身定制的细分准则。这种方法对于从事代理模型设计工作的社区特别有用。",
