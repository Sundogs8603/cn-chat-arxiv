    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了矩阵值时间序列的统计分析。这些数据是在一个传感器网络上收集的（通常是一组空间位置），观测到每个传感器的每个时间点的特征向量。因此，每个传感器由一个向量时序列来描述。我们希望识别这些传感器之间的依赖结构，并用图形来表示它。当每个传感器只有一个特征时，矢量自回归模型已被广泛应用于推断格兰杰因果关系的结构。所得到的图被称为因果图。我们的第一个贡献是将VAR模型扩展为矩阵变量模型，以用于图形学习的目的。其次，我们提出了两种在线过程，分别适用于低维和高维情况，在新样本到达时可以快速更新系数的估计。特别是在高维情况下，引入了一种新的Lasso-type，并对其进行了拓扑处理。",
