    "translated_abstract": "股票市场的不可预测性和波动性使得用任何泛化方案获得可观利润变得具有挑战性。许多先前的研究尝试使用不同的技术构建机器学习模型，通过实时交易在美国股市中获得可观利润。然而，很少有研究关注找到特定交易期间的最佳特征的重要性。我们的最佳方法通过性能来将特征从148个缩小到约30个。此外，在每次训练机器学习模型之前，我们会动态选择前25个特征。它使用了四个分类器的集成学习：高斯朴素贝叶斯、决策树、具有L1正则化的逻辑回归和随机梯度下降，以决定是否对特定股票进行做多或做空交易。我们的最佳模型在2011年7月至2019年1月之间进行每日交易，获得了54.35%的利润。最后，我们的工作展示了混合机器学习分类器与有效特征提取在股票交易中的应用潜力。",
