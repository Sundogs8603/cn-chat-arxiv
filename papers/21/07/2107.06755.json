    "translated_abstract": "这项研究实习是由挪威北极大学（UiT）为我们团队提供的，我们是“智能道路-冬季道路维护2021”黑客马拉松的获胜者。实习从2021年5月3日开始，于2021年5月21日结束，每周进行两次会议。尽管我们实习生有不同的国籍和教育背景，但我们尽可能地作为一个团队合作。最吸引人的部分是我们意识到北极人民面临的严峻条件，从我们目前居住的地方很难获得这样独特的经验。我们开发和实施了几个深度学习模型来对状态（干燥、湿润、潮湿、结冰、积雪、泥泞）进行分类。根据最佳模型，天气预报应用程序将考虑Ta、Tsurf、Height、Speed、Water等因素来预测状态。关键部分是定义一个安全度量标准，该标准是基于摩擦力和事故率的乘积。",
    "tldr": "本研究实习项目旨在通过开发深度学习模型来改善北极地区的道路维护。实习团队成功地开发出一个天气预报应用程序，该应用程序可以准确预测道路的状态，从而提高道路安全性。",
