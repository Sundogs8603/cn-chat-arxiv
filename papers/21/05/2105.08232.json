    "translated_abstract": "矩阵感知问题是一种重要的低秩优化问题，在矩阵补全、相位同步/恢复、稳健PCA和电力系统状态估计等领域都有广泛应用。本文研究了通过线性测量损坏的噪声低秩矩阵感知问题。我们考虑了搜索秩r等于未知真实秩r*的情况（精确参数化情况），以及r大于r*的情况（过度参数化情况）。我们量化了约束等异性性质（restricted isometry property，RIP）在塑造非凸分解公式的整体景观和帮助局部搜索算法成功方面的作用。首先，我们在RIP常数小于 1/(1+sqrt(r*/r))的假设下，对非凸问题的任意局部极小值和真实值之间的最大距离进行了全局保证。然后，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，称为鲁棒错误定位几何分析（Robust Error-Locating Geometric Analysis，RELGA）算法，用于实现在存在噪声的情况下的精确低秩矩阵恢复。RELGA算法通过组合错误定位机制和几何分析，提供了理论保证，即使在噪声水平相对较大的情况下，也可以实现精确的矩阵恢复。对于过度参数化情况，我们提出了一种局部搜索算法，称为连续子空间优化（Successive Subspace Optimization，SSO）算法，在噪声水平和RIP常数的一定条件下，可以收敛到真实解。我们的分析揭示了SSO的成功取决于初始化、非退化性和几何条件的组合。",
