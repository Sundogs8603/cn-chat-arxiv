    "translated_abstract": "尽管中央处理器（CPU）的性能迅速提升，但使用计算流体力学（CFD）模拟化学反应流动的计算成本在许多情况下仍不可行。虽然已研究了将专门用于图像处理的卷积神经网络（CNN）应用于流场预测，但最近出现了为CFD设计适应的神经网络的需求。本研究开发了一种引入有限体积方法（FVM）的神经网络模型，具有独特的网络架构和物理信息损失函数，用于加速CFD模拟。开发的网络模型考虑了CFD流场的特性，其中所有网格都应用相同的控制方程，可以仅使用两个先前的场来预测未来的场，而不像CNN那样需要许多场图像（>10,000）。使用非反应流和反应流模拟的CFD时序数据评估了这个基准模型的性能；",
