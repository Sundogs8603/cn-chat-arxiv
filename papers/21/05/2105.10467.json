    "translated_abstract": "转移概率密度函数（TPDF）对于计算金融，包括期权定价和对冲，是基础性的。在深度学习的最新研究基础上，我们通过在参数空间中解决后向科尔莫哥洛夫方程为累积概率函数开发了新颖的神经网络TPDF生成器。这些生成器超快速、非常准确，并且可以为随机微分方程描述的任何资产模型进行训练。它们是“单次求解”，因此在改变随机模型的参数时（例如重新校准波动率）不需要重新训练。一旦训练完成，神经网络TPDF生成器可以转移到性能较弱的计算机上，在那里它们可以用于以与已知的闭式TPDF一样快的速度进行期权定价。我们通过将它们插入数值期权定价方法中来展示所提出的TPDF的计算效率。我们展示了广泛的应用范围，包括Black-Scholes模型和Heston模型等。",
