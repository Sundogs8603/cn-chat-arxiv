    "abstract": "I introduce a model-free methodology to assess the impact of disaster risk on the market return. Using S&P500 returns and the risk-neutral quantile function derived from option prices, I employ quantile regression to estimate local differences between the conditional physical and risk-neutral distributions. The results indicate substantial disparities primarily in the left-tail, reflecting the influence of disaster risk on the equity premium. These differences vary over time and persist beyond crisis periods. On average, the bottom 5% of returns contribute to 17% of the equity premium, shedding light on the Peso problem. I also find that disaster risk increases the stochastic discount factor's volatility. Using a lower bound observed from option prices on the left-tail difference between the physical and risk-neutral quantile functions, I obtain similar results, reinforcing the robustness of my findings.",

    "translated_abstract": "我引入了一种无模型的方法来评估灾害风险对市场回报的影响。利用标普500指数的收益率和从期权价格中推导出的风险中性分位函数，我使用分位回归来估计条件物理分布和风险中性分布之间的局部差异。结果显示主要是在左尾部存在显著差异，反映了灾害风险对股票溢价的影响。这些差异随时间变化，并在危机期间之后持续存在。平均而言，底部5%的收益对股票溢价的贡献约为17%，揭示了“佩索问题”。我还发现，灾害风险增加了随机贴现因子的波动性。利用从期权价格中观察到的物理分位函数和风险中性分位函数之间的左尾差异的下界，我得到了类似的结果，从而加强了我的研究结果的稳健性。",
