However, this price is not available in closed form and requires numerical methods such as Monte Carlo or polynomial approximations to evaluate it. We show that these methods can be inaccurate and propose a deterministic decomposition of the reservation price using the Lambert function. This decomposition allows us to perform an improved Monte Carlo method, which we name Lambert Monte Carlo (LMC) and to give deterministic approximations of the reservation price and of the optimal strategies based on the Lambert function. We also give an answer to the problem of selecting a hedging asset that minimizes the reservation price and also the cash invested. Our theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.",

    "translated_abstract": "在流动性不足的情况下，保留价格是通常的鞅方法无法应用时的一个被广泛接受的替代方法。然而，这个价格并不以闭式形式给出，需要使用诸如蒙特卡罗或多项式逼近等数值方法来评估。我们展示了这些方法可能存在不准确性，并提出了使用 Lambert函数对保留价格进行确定性分解的方法。这种分解使我们能够执行一个改进的蒙特卡罗方法，我们将其命名为Lambert Monte Carlo（LMC），并基于 Lambert函数给出保留价格和最优策略的确定性逼近。我们还就选择最小化保留价格和现金投资的对冲资产问题提供了答案。我们的理论结果通过数值模拟加以说明。",
