    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究使用深度学习在科学和工程中发展了偏微分方程（PDE）模型。PDE的功能形式由神经网络确定，并且神经网络参数根据可用数据进行校准。嵌入PDE中的神经网络的校准可以通过在PDE上进行优化来实现。受这些应用的启发，我们对带有神经网络项的一类线性椭圆PDE的优化进行了严格研究。使用梯度下降优化PDE中的神经网络参数，其中梯度是使用伴随PDE计算的。随着参数数量的增加，PDE和伴随PDE收敛到一个非局部的PDE系统。使用此极限PDE系统，我们能够证明在优化过程中神经网络-PDE收敛到全局最小值。最后，我们使用此伴随方法在流体力学中训练一个神经网络模型，其中神经网络作为一个闭环运作。",
