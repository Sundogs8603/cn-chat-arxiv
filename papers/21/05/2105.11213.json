    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑共享时隙无线信道的多个相邻节点系统，并寻求一种具有低平均延迟、分布式控制（即不存在中央调度器）且不需要显式交换状态信息或控制信号的MAC协议。这种MAC协议的设计必须考虑轻量级流量的竞争访问和重负载下的定时访问，导致人们长期以来对混合自适应MAC的兴趣。在离散时间设置中，对于分布式MAC设计，我们考虑每个节点拥有本地信息和一些从监听中获得的公共信息的实际信息结构。在此设置中，“ZMAC”是一种现有的混合自适应协议。我们通过以下两个步骤来解决这个问题：(1)我们表明策略“贪心”和“穷尽”是充分的。将策略限制在这个类别中，可以将问题简化为获得一个队列。",
