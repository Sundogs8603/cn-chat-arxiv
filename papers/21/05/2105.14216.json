Recently, algorithms for minimax problems in the Federated Learning (FL) paradigm have received considerable interest.

In this paper, we develop the first practical algorithm named CDMA for general minimax problems in the cross-device FL setting.

    "translated_abstract": "极小化问题涉及到许多重要应用，包括鲁棒对抗学习和生成对抗网络（GAN）训练。最近，在联合学习（FL）范式下解决极小化问题的算法引起了极大的关注。现有的一般极小化问题的联合算法需要在每轮训练中进行完全聚合（即对来自所有客户端的本地模型信息进行聚合）。因此，在涉及到许多不可靠的移动/IoT设备的重要的交叉设备联合学习设置中，这些算法是不适用的。在本文中，我们开发了一种名为CDMA的第一个实用算法，该算法用于解决交叉设备联合学习中的一般极小化问题。CDMA基于“一旦有足够的响应，立即开始”的机制，即服务器首先向一部分客户端发出信号执行本地计算，然后一旦接收到足够多的客户端响应，开始聚合客户端报告的本地结果。",
