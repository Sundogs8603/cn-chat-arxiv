    "translated_abstract": "在可解释的人工智能（XAI）领域中，布尔函数对于解释二进制分类器越来越受关注。传统的布尔函数方法采用命题逻辑。我们提出了一种以ceteris paribus为基础的模态语言，支持对二进制输入分类器及其属性进行推理。我们研究了一系列分类器模型，将其公理化为关于语言基数的两个证明系统，并证明了我们公理系统的完备性。此外，我们证明了在无限变量情况下，我们模态语言的可满足性检查问题是NEXPTIME完全的，而在有限变量情况下，该问题变为多项式复杂度。我们还在无限变量情况下确定了一个有趣的NP片段。我们利用这种语言来形式化对事实条件以及包括从属、对比和反事实解释以及偏见在内的各种解释概念。最后，我们提出了两种扩展的方法。",

The completeness of two proof systems regarding the cardinality of the language is proven, and the satisfiability checking problem for the modal language is studied in both infinite-variable and finite-variable cases. Additionally, various notions of explanation, including counterfactual, contrastive, and abductive explanations, as well as biases, are formalized using this language."
