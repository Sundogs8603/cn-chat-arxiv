Many automated actions taken by a smart home are governed by the output of an underlying activity recognition system.

    "translated_abstract": "智能家居环境旨在通过安装在整个空间中的各种传感器和执行器提供帮助改善居民生活质量的服务。智能家居采取的许多自动化操作都是由基础活动识别系统的输出控制的。然而，活动识别系统可能并不完全准确，因此智能家居操作的不一致性可能会导致依赖智能家居预测的用户想知道“为什么智能家居要那样做？” 在这项工作中，我们在可解释人工智能（XAI）技术的见解基础上构建了一个可解释的活动识别框架，利用领先的XAI方法生成自然语言解释，解释活动中什么导致了给定的分类。在远程照护监测的背景下，我们进行了两步评估：（a）利用ML专家评估解释的合理性，（b）招募非专业人员",
