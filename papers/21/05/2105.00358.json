    "abstract": "This paper studies identification of the marginal treatment effect (MTE) when a binary treatment variable is misclassified. We show under standard assumptions that the MTE is identified as the derivative of the conditional expectation of the observed outcome given the true propensity score, which is partially identified. We characterize the identified set for this propensity score, and then for the MTE. We show under some mild regularity conditions that the sign of the MTE is locally identified. We use our MTE bounds to derive bounds on other commonly used parameters in the literature. We show that our bounds are tighter than the existing bounds for the local average treatment effect. We illustrate the practical relevance of our derived bounds through some numerical and empirical results.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了二元治疗变量被误分类时边际处理效应（MTE）的识别。我们证明，在标准假设下，MTE可被识别为给定真实倾向得分的观察结果条件期望的导数，而倾向得分仅被部分确定。我们刻画了该倾向得分的识别集，然后是MTE的识别集，证明了在一些温和的正则条件下，MTE的符号局部被确定。我们使用我们的MTE界限推导了文献中其他常用参数的界限。我们展示了我们的界限比局部平均处理效应的现有界限更紧。我们通过一些数值和实证结果展示了我们得出的界限的实际相关性。",
