    "abstract": "We propose a new nonparametric modeling framework for causal inference when outcomes depend on how agents are linked in a social or economic network. Such network interference describes a large literature on treatment spillovers, social interactions, social learning, information diffusion, disease and financial contagion, social capital formation, and more. Our approach works by first characterizing how an agent is linked in the network using the configuration of other agents and connections nearby as measured by path distance. The impact of a policy or treatment assignment is then learned by pooling outcome data across similarly configured agents. We demonstrate the approach by proposing an asymptotically valid test for the hypothesis of policy irrelevance/no treatment effects and bounding the mean-squared error of a k-nearest-neighbor estimator for the average or distributional policy effect/treatment response.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的非参数建模框架，用于处理社交或经济网络中代理人之间连接方式对结果产生影响的因果推断问题。这种网络干扰描述了关于治疗溢出、社交互动、社会学习、信息扩散、疾病和金融传染、社会资本形成等领域的大量文献。我们的方法首先通过测量路径距离来描述代理人在网络中的连接方式，然后通过汇集具有类似配置的代理人的结果数据来学习政策或治疗分配的影响。我们通过提出一个渐近有效的测试来演示该方法，该测试用于检验政策无关性/治疗效应的假设，并给出了针对平均或分布式政策效应/治疗反应的k最近邻估计器的均方误差的上界。",
