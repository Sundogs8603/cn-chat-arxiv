We also show, however, that this comes at a cost: Optimistic solutions are more sensitive to model error than either worst-case or SAA optimizers, and hence are less robust and calibrating the worst- or best-case model to outperform SAA may be difficult when data is limited.",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然分布鲁棒优化（DRO）问题的解有时可能比样本平均逼近（SAA）的预期奖励要高，但并不保证总是这样。本文引入了一类分布乐观优化（DOO）模型，并证明如果我们考虑最优情况（DOO）和最坏情况（DRO）模型，那么总是可以“击败”SAA的外推效果。然而，我们也证明，这是有代价的：乐观解比最坏情况或SAA优化器更敏感于模型错误，因此不太鲁棒，并且在数据有限时很难校准最坏或最优情况模型以超越SAA。",
