    "translated_abstract": "近年来，越来越多的人开始关注机器具备推理能力，这需要准确清晰地提供线索。在现有的研究中，线索通常被建模为实体感知知识。然而，这些实体感知线索主要集中于常识，对于需要了解临时事实或事件的任务，特别是在阅读理解的逻辑推理中，这些线索是不足够的。为了解决这一挑战，我们有动力以分层方式涵盖常识和临时知识线索。具体而言，我们提出了一种知识单元的通用形式，通过提取句子的骨干构成部分，如主语-谓语-宾语形成的“事实”。然后，在事实单元之上构建一个超图，允许句子级别（事实组之间的关系）和实体级别交互（事实中的概念或行动）的互动。在逻辑推理基准测试和大规模阅读理解中，实验结果证明了我们的方法的优越性。",
