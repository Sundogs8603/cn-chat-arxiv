We model dynamic arrivals of one or both of demand and supply with uncertain locations of future arrivals, and characterize the scaling behavior of the achievable cost in terms of system size (number of supply units), as a function of the dimension d. Our achievability results are backed by concrete matching algorithms.

Furthermore, in all cases except one, cost nearly as low in terms of scaling as the expected distance to the nearest neighboring supply unit is achievable, i.e., the matching constraint does not cause an increase in cost either.

    "translated_abstract": "受各种在线匹配平台的启发，我们考虑在[0,1]^d范围内随机分布的需求和供应单位，每个需求单位需要与一个供应单位匹配。目标是最小化匹配对之间的期望平均距离（\"成本\"）。我们建模了需求和供应的动态到达，并根据系统规模（供应单位数量）和维度d的函数，表征了可实现成本的缩放行为。我们的成果得到了具体匹配算法的支持。在不同情况下，我们发现该平台可以实现接近于预先知道未来到达位置的成本。此外，在除一个例外情况外，几乎可以实现与最近邻供应单位的期望距离相当的低成本，即匹配约束不会导致成本的增加。",
