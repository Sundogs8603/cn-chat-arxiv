    "translated_abstract": "误差有界的有损压缩对于当今科学项目的成功非常重要，因为在模拟或仪器数据采集过程中产生的数据量巨大。它不仅可以显著减小数据大小，还可以根据用户指定的误差界限来控制压缩误差。自动编码器（AE）模型在图像压缩中被广泛使用，但很少有基于AE的压缩方法支持误差界限特性，而这在科学应用中是非常需要的。为了解决这个问题，我们探索了使用卷积自动编码器改进误差有界科学数据压缩的方法，并提出以下三个关键贡献：（1）我们深入研究了各种自动编码器模型的特性，并在SZ模型的基础上开发了一个误差有界的自动编码器框架。（2）我们优化了我们设计的基于AE的误差有界压缩框架中的主要阶段的压缩质量。",
