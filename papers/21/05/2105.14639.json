    "abstract": "In this paper, we try to improve exploration in Blackbox methods, particularly Evolution strategies (ES), when applied to Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems where intermediate waypoints/subgoals are available. Since Evolutionary strategies are highly parallelizable, instead of extracting just a scalar cumulative reward, we use the state-action pairs from the trajectories obtained during rollouts/evaluations, to learn the dynamics of the agent. The learnt dynamics are then used in the optimization procedure to speed-up training. Lastly, we show how our proposed approach is universally applicable by presenting results from experiments conducted on Carla driving and UR5 robotic arm simulators.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文致力于改进黑盒方法，特别是进化策略在应用于具有中间航点/子目标的强化学习问题时的探索能力。由于进化策略具有高度可并行化的特点，我们将不仅提取标量累积奖励，而是利用在推出/评估过程中获得的轨迹中的状态-动作对来学习代理的动力学。然后，将学到的动力学用于优化过程以加速训练。最后，我们通过在Carla驾驶和UR5机械臂模拟器上进行的实验结果展示了我们提出的方法的普适性。",

By learning the dynamics of the agent and integrating it into the optimization process, the training speed is accelerated. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be universally applicable through experiments on Carla driving and UR5 robotic arm simulators."
