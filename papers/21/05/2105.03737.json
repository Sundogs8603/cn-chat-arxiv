    "abstract": "Empirical work often uses treatment assigned following geographic boundaries. When the effects of treatment cross over borders, classical difference-in-differences estimation produces biased estimates for the average treatment effect. In this paper, I introduce a potential outcomes framework to model spillover effects and decompose the estimate's bias in two parts: (1) the control group no longer identifies the counterfactual trend because their outcomes are affected by treatment and (2) changes in treated units' outcomes reflect the effect of their own treatment status and the effect from the treatment status of 'close' units. I propose conditions for non-parametric identification that can remove both sources of bias and semi-parametrically estimate the spillover effects themselves including in settings with staggered treatment timing. To highlight the importance of spillover effects, I revisit analyses of three place-based interventions.",

    "translated_abstract": "实证研究通常使用跨越地理边界的处理方式。当处理的影响跨越边界时，传统的区别于差异估计会产生对平均处理效应的偏差估计。在本文中，我引入了一个潜在结果框架，以模拟溢出效应，并将估计的偏差分解为两部分：（1）控制组不再确定对照趋势，因为他们的结果受到处理的影响；（2）处理组单位结果的变化反映了他们自己的处理状态和接近的单位的处理状态的影响。我提出了非参数识别的条件，可以消除这两种偏差源，并在具有阶段性处理时间的情况下进行半参数估计溢出效应本身。为了突出溢出效应的重要性，我重温了对三种基于地点的干预措施的分析。",
