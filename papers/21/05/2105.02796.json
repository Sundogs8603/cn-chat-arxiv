    "translated_abstract": "高斯过程回归是一种基于贝叶斯原理的流行的非参数回归方法，可以提供其预测的不确定性估计。然而，这些估计是贝叶斯性质的，对于一些重要的应用，如具有安全保证的基于学习的控制，需要频率的不确定性界限。尽管对于高斯过程，这样严格的界限有可用，但它们过于保守，在应用中没有用处。这通常导致实践者用启发式方法替代这些界限，从而破坏了所有的理论保证。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了新的不确定性界限，既严格又实用。特别地，这些界限可以明确地评估，并且比现有结果要保守得多。此外，我们还展示了某些模型偏差只会引起优雅的退化。我们展示了这些优势以及我们结果在基于学习的控制中的实用性。",
