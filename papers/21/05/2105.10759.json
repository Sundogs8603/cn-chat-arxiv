    "translated_abstract": "我们展示了何时以及如何可以通过不同空间中的一对元素唯一地表示基础动力系统的整个左无限轨道或来自这样的左无限轨道的观测，我们称之为“因果嵌入”现象。这些成对的集合是从驱动的动力系统中导出的，并用于学习一个函数，该函数与驱动系统一起确定一个拓扑共轭于基础系统的系统，使得预测基础系统的动态成为可能，因为这种共轭是可计算且通用的，即它不依赖于基础系统，即使在学习函数时存在误差，也能保证吸引子包含因果嵌入物体的图像。通过实现这些，我们引领了一种新的预测方案，其优于现有的储备计算方案，后者通常导致长期不一致性很差，因为无法保证存在可学习的系统。",
