    "translated_abstract": "学习个体化治疗规则对于精准医疗至关重要。当前文献主要关注从单个来源人群中导出个体化治疗规则。然而，当来源人群与目标人群不同时，我们需要考虑观察数据设置。与平均治疗效应的因果推广不同，个体化治疗规则的推广由于需要基于一个预先指定的函数类对规则进行建模和推广，因此面临着新的挑战，该函数类可能不包含无约束真正最优个体化治疗规则。本文旨在开发一种加权框架，以缓解这种错误规定的影响，从而促进从来源人群到目标人群的最优个体化治疗规则的泛化。我们的方法寻求在由再生核希尔伯特空间表征的非参数函数类上进行协变量平衡，并且可以改进许多依赖于权重的个体化治疗规则学习方法。我们证明了样本加权估计的一致性。",
