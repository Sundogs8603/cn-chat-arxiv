    "abstract": "I propose an approach to quantify attention to inflation in the data and show that the decrease in the volatility and persistence of U.S. inflation after the Great Inflation period was accompanied by a decline in the public's attention to inflation. This decline in attention has important implications (positive and normative) for monetary policy as it renders managing inflation expectations more difficult and can lead to inflation-attention traps: prolonged periods of a binding lower bound and low inflation due to slowly-adjusting inflation expectations. As attention declines the optimal policy response is to increase the inflation target. Accounting for the lower bound fundamentally changes the normative implications of declining attention. While lower attention raises welfare absent the lower-bound constraint, it decreases welfare when accounting for the lower bound.",

    "translated_abstract": "我提出了一种在数据中量化对通胀关注的方法，并且展示了在大通胀时期之后，美国通胀的波动性和持续性的下降伴随着公众对通胀的关注减少。这种关注下降对货币政策具有重要的（积极和规范性的）影响，因为它使得管理通胀预期更加困难，并且可能导致通胀关注陷阱：由于缓慢调整的通胀预期，出现了连续长时间的下限约束和低通胀。随着注意力的下降，最佳的政策响应是增加通胀目标。考虑到下限约束，注意力下降的规范性影响发生了根本性的改变。尽管在没有下限约束的情况下，较低的关注度提高了福利，但在考虑到下限约束时，它会降低福利。",
