Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to traffic signal control recently and demonstrated promising performance where each traffic signal is regarded as an agent. However, there are still several challenges that may limit its large-scale application in the real world. To make the policy learned from a training scenario generalizable to new unseen scenarios, a novel Meta Variationally Intrinsic Motivated (MetaVIM) RL method is proposed to learn the decentralized policy for each intersection that considers neighbor information in a latent way. Specifically, we formulate the policy learning as a meta-learning problem over a set of related tasks, where each task corresponds to traffic signal control at an intersection whose neighbors are regarded as the unobserved part of the state.

    "translated_abstract": "交通信号控制旨在协调交叉口的交通信号，以改善区域或城市的交通效率。最近，深度强化学习（RL）已被应用于交通信号控制，并表现出有希望的性能，其中每个交通信号被视为一个代理。然而，在现实世界中，仍存在一些可能限制其大规模应用的挑战。为了使从训练场景中学到的策略能够推广到新的未见场景，提出了一种新颖的Meta Variationally Intrinsic Motivated（MetaVIM）RL方法，用于学习考虑邻居信息的每个交叉口的分散式策略。具体来说，我们将策略学习形式化为一个关于一组相关任务的元学习问题，其中每个任务对应于一个交叉口的交通信号控制，其邻居被视为状态的未观察部分。",
