In this work, we propose a data-driven shape encoding and generating method, which automatically learns representations from existing airfoils and uses the learned representations to generate new airfoils.

Our model is built upon VAEGAN, a neural network that combines Variational Autoencoder with Generative Adversarial Network and is trained by the gradient-based technique.
