We first analyze the regularized setting, in which the admissible strategies do not ensure complete execution of the initial inventory. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a continuous and bounded viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, whence we obtain a characterization of the optimal trading rate.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个框架下的投资组合执行问题，该框架中波动性和流动性都是不确定的。在我们的模型中，我们假设一个多维马尔可夫随机因子驱动它们。此外，我们将间接流动性成本建模为临时价格影响，将其与交易者的周转率相关联。我们首先分析了规范化设置，在这种设置中，可许可策略不能保证初始库存的完全执行。我们证明了Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman方程的连续和有界黏度解的存在唯一性，从而得到了最优交易率的表征。作为我们证明的副产品，我们得到了一个数值算法。然后，我们通过单调性论证解决了约束问题，其中可许可策略必须保证对交易者进行完全执行。我们通过将规范化对应物的奇异极限求得了最优策略。",
