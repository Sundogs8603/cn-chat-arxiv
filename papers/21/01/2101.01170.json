    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了用于弹性参数的聚拢识别策略，该参数总结了代理人对于激励计划中斜率（拐点）或截距（切口）变化的反应。我们展示了当前的聚拢方法可能非常敏感于文献中关于未观测到的个体异质性的隐含假设。通过引入新的非参数估计量和半参数估计量，我们克服了这种敏感性问题。我们的估计器允许研究人员展示聚拢弹性如何依赖于不同的识别假设，以及弹性在假设下是否稳健。我们遵循文献并在等弹性效用模型和创造分段线性预算限制的所得税计划的背景下推导了我们的方法。我们在美国获得所得税抵免中展示了聚拢行为提供了自雇和未婚纳税人稳健的估计。相比之下，自雇和已婚纳税人的估计依赖于具体的识别假设。",
