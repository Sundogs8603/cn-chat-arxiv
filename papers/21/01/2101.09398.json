    "translated_abstract": "自从Abadie和Gardeazabal（2003）提出以来，合成控制（SC）方法已经迅速成为面板数据观测研究中估计因果效应的主要方法之一。正式的讨论通常通过假设潜在结果由一个因子模型生成来激励SC方法。本文从设计角度研究了SC方法，假设选取受试单元和周期的模型。我们表明，在随机分配下，标准的SC估计量通常是有偏的。我们提出了一个修改的无偏合成控制（MUSC）估计量，在随机分配下保证无偏，推导了它的确切、基于随机性的有限样本方差。我们还提出了一个这个方差的无偏估计量。我们在真实数据的设置中记录，随机分配下，SC类估计器的均方根误差可以大大降低，低于其他常见估计器。",
