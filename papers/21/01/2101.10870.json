    "translated_abstract": "基于机器学习和深度学习算法的人体活动识别（HAR）被认为是最具潜力的技术之一，用于监测不同人群（如运动员、老年人、儿童、雇主）的专业和日常活动，以提供各种与福祉、技术性能增强、风险预防和教育目的相关的服务。然而，HAR方法的有效性和效率分析受到缺乏标准工作流程的影响，这可能成为评估开发的模式识别模型质量的基准。这使得不同方法之间的比较成为一项具有挑战性的任务。此外，研究人员可能会犯错误，当这些错误没有被检测到时，会对达到的结果产生重大影响。为了缓解这些问题，本文提出了一个名为B-HAR的开源自动化和高度可配置的框架，用于定义和标准化HAR实验的工作流程。",
