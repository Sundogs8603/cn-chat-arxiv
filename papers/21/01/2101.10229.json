The UAP can be stated as follows. Let $n$ and $m$ be the dimension of input and output data, and assume $m\\leq n$. Then we show that ODENet of width $n+m$ with any non-polynomial continuous activation function can approximate any continuous function on a compact subset on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We also show that ResNet has the same property as the depth tends to infinity. Furthermore, we derive the gradient of a loss function explicitly with respect to a certain tuning variable. We use this to construct a learning algorithm for ODENet. To demonstrate the usefulness of this algorithm, we apply it to a regression problem, a binary classification, and a multinomial classification in MNIST.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们证明了一类ODENet和一类ResNet的通用逼近性质(UAP)，它们是具有跳跃连接的深度学习系统的简化数学模型。 UAP可以陈述如下:设$n$和$m$分别为输入数据和输出数据的维数，并假设$m\\leq n$。然后我们证明了带有非多项式连续激活函数的宽度为$n+m$的ODENet可以逼近$\\mathbb {R} ^ n$上紧致子集上的任何连续函数。我们还证明了当深度趋于无限时，ResNet具有相同的性质。此外，我们明确推导了损失函数对某个调整变量的梯度。 我们将其用于构建ODENet的学习算法。为了展示此算法的实用性，我们将其应用于MNIST上的回归问题、二分类和多项分类。",
