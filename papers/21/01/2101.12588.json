    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种在线缓存问题，其中请求可以通过本地缓存来服务，以避免从远程服务器检索成本。缓存可以在请求的一批之后更新其状态，并存储每个文件的任意小部分。我们研究了基于在线镜像下降（OMD）策略的无遗憾算法。我们证明了遗憾的界限关键取决于请求过程的多样性，由请求批处理大小R和给定批处理中请求的最大重复度h所提供的多样性比率R/h。我们表征了不同多样性方案下OMD缓存策略关于遗憾的最优性。我们还证明了当缓存必须存储整个文件而不是一部分时，OMD策略可以与随机舍入方案相耦合，即使不能忽略更新成本，也能保持遗憾保证。我们通过最优输运理论为舍入问题提供了正式的表征，并提出了一种新的基于在线镜像下降策略的缓存算法。",

Moreover, the authors prove that the no-regret property can be preserved even when the cache needs to store the entire file."
