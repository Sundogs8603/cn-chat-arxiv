    "translated_abstract": "我们使用弱信号渐近行为的方法研究了一类顺序随机实验，包括解决多臂赌博机问题的实验。在一个$n$个时间步骤的实验中，我们让不同动作的平均奖励间隙按照$1/\\sqrt{n}$的比例缩放，以保持学习任务的难度随着$n$的增长而保持不变。在这种情况下，我们发现一类顺序随机实验的样本路径会弱收敛到扩散极限，其中，臂选择的概率会随着状态的变化而持续变化，并在满足连续性假设的情况下进行调整。扩散极限使我们能够推导出精细的、特定于实例的随机动力学特征，并获得关于几种顺序实验的后悔和信念演变的多个见解，包括汤普森采样（但不包括不满足我们连续性假设的UCB）。我们展示了所有顺序实验的表现都能在长时间内稳定。",
