    "translated_abstract": "异构图通常指具有不同类型的节点和边的图。从异构图中提取有用信息的常见方法是使用元图，可以看作是与异构图具有相同节点和边类型的特殊有向无环图（DAG）。然而，如何设计合适的元图是具有挑战性的。最近，有许多关于从异构图中学习适当的元图的研究。现有方法通常引入独立于彼此的边的连续权重，忽略了元图的拓扑结构，可能效果不佳。为解决这个问题，我们提出了一个基于张量的新视角来学习元图。这个视角不仅有助于解释现有工作中CANDECOMP/PARAFAC（CP）分解的局限性，而且激发了我们提出了一种反映DAG结构的拓扑感知张量分解方法，称为TENSUS。",
