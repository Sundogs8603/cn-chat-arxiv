    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种称为未标记主成分分析（UPCA）的方法，用于从被置换损坏的数据矩阵中提取鲁棒的主成分。利用代数几何，我们证明了UPCA是一个良定义的代数问题，即与给定数据相一致的最小秩矩阵只有作为多项式方程组的唯一解的实际矩阵的行置换。此外，我们提出了一个适用于实际相关情况的高效两阶段算法流程用于UPCA，其中只有一部分数据被置换。阶段I利用鲁棒的异常值主成分分析方法来估计实际矩阵的列空间。在具备列空间的情况下，阶段II应用最近的无标记感知方法来恢复被置换的数据。在UPCA的基础上允许出现缺失条目和置换导致了无标记矩阵补全问题，我们为此推导了理论和算法。",
