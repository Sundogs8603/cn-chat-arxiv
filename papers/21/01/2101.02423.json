We propose a class of dominant-strategy incentive compatible and ex-post individually rational mechanisms, which we call the adjusted mean-thresholding (AMT) mechanisms. We show that when the cost of provision grows slower than the $\\sqrt{n}$-rate, the AMT mechanisms are both eventually ex-ante budget balanced and asymptotically efficient. When the cost grows faster than the $\\sqrt{n}$-rate, in contrast, we show that any incentive compatible, individually rational, and eventually ex-ante budget balanced mechanism must have provision probability converging to zero and hence cannot be asymptotically efficient. The AMT mechanisms have a simple form and are more informationally robust when compared to, for example, the second-best mechanism. This is because the construction of an AMT mechanism depends only on the first moment of the valuation distribution.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨在一个包含$n$个独立代理的大型经济中进行公共物品供给的机制设计问题。我们提出了一类主导策略激励兼顾后结果个体理性的机制，称为调整均值阈值（AMT）机制。我们表明，当供给成本增长速度小于$\\sqrt{n}$时，AMT机制既在经历一段时间后的预算平衡，也是渐近有效的。相反地，当成本增长速度快于$\\sqrt{n}$时，我们表明，任何满足激励兼顾、个体理性和经历一段时间后的预算平衡的机制必须具有收敛于零的供给概率，因此无法渐近有效。与其它机制（例如，次优机制）相比，AMT机制具有简单的形式，并且在信息方面更加鲁棒，这是因为AMT机制的构建仅依赖于价值分布的第一矩。",
