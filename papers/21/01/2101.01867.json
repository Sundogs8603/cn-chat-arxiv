    "translated_abstract": "dame-flame是一个Python软件包，用于在包含离散协变量的数据集上执行观察性因果推断的匹配。该软件包实现了动态几乎完全匹配(DAME)和快速大规模几乎完全匹配(FLAME)算法，这些算法在协变量的子集上匹配治疗和对照组。由此产生的匹配组是可解释的，因为匹配是在协变量上进行的，并且是高质量的，因为机器学习可用于确定需要匹配的重要协变量。DAME通过解决优化问题只要在最可能的协变量上匹配单位，重要的协变量有优先匹配的机会。FLAME通过更快的向后特征选择过程，近似于DAME找到的解决方案。该软件包提供多个可调参数以适应特定应用程序，并且可以在匹配之后计算治疗效应估计值。这些参数的描述以及有关估计处理效果的详细信息可以在软件包文档中找到。",
