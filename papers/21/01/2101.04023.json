    "translated_abstract": "定价金融衍生品，尤其是不同到期时间和价格的欧式期权，是金融中一个重要的问题。当假设常数波动率和利率时，描述香草期权价格的动态由布莱克-斯科尔斯模型控制，该模型是一个线性抛物型偏微分方程，其终值由期权合约的支付方式确定，没有其他边界条件。在这里，我们提出了一种在量子计算机上通过将布莱克-斯科尔斯方程映射到薛定谔方程来解决问题的数字量子算法。由于得到的哈密顿算符的非幺正性质，我们通过使用一个附加量子比特将其传播器嵌入到一个扩增的希尔伯特空间中来解决问题。此外，由于周期性边界条件的选择，由动量算符的离散化定义，我们复制了初始条件，从而大大提高了协议的稳定性和性能。",
