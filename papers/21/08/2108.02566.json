    "translated_abstract": "缺失数据填补是数据分析中的基础问题，许多研究已经探索了模型结构和学习过程来提高其性能。然而，数据增强作为一种简单而有效的方法，在这个领域里没有得到足够的关注。我们提出了一种新颖的数据增强方法，称为缺失数据增强（MisA），用于生成式填补模型。我们的方法利用生成器的输出每一轮动态产生不完整样本，通过一个简单的重构损失对增强样本进行约束，并将此损失与原始损失组合成最终的优化目标。作为一种通用的增强技术，MisA可以轻松地集成到生成式填补框架中，为提高性能提供了一种简单却有效的方法。实验结果表明，MisA显著提高了许多最近提出的生成式填补模型的性能。",
