    "translated_abstract": "本论文考虑了由前向派遣和实时重新调度组成的两阶段发电计划问题。前者必须面对包括不可调度电力消费和可再生能源发电在内的不确定净需求。后者通过在系统实际运行期间利用平衡电力应对相对于前向计划的合理偏差。标准工业实践通过用其条件期望的良好估计值（通常称为点预测）替换不确定的净需求来处理前向阶段的不确定净需求，以最小化实时平衡电力的需求。然而，众所周知，电力系统的成本结构高度不对称并且依赖于其运行点，因此最小化电力不平衡量并不一定与最小化操作成本一致。在本论文中，我们提出了一个双层方案来构建一个决策规则，根据系统的不确定性和不对称成本结构，在前向派遣阶段预测净需求。我们通过数值测试证明了我们方法的有效性。",
