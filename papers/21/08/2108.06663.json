    "translated_abstract": "尽管经过几十年的研究，手写字符识别（HCR）仍然是一个具有挑战性的模式识别问题，并且缺乏脱机识别技术的研究。这主要是由于相似的字符结构、不同的手写风格、不同的书写系统、手工特征提取技术、数据和代码的不可用性，以及脚本特定的深度学习技术的发展。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一个名为HCR-Net的脱机深度学习网络，为HCR研究开辟了新的研究方向。HCR-Net基于一种新颖的用于HCR的迁移学习方法，\\textit{部分利用}了预训练网络的特征提取层。由于迁移学习和图像增强，HCR-Net提供了更快、更高效的训练，更好的性能和泛化能力，并且可以处理少量数据...",
