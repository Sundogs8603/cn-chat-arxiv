    "translated_abstract": "问题回答在知识图谱和其他RDF数据上已经取得了巨大的进展，许多优秀的系统可以为自然语言问题或电报查询提供清晰的答案。其中一些系统将文本源作为附加证据纳入回答过程，但不能计算仅存在于文本中的答案。相反，IR和NLP社区的系统已经解决了有关文本的QA问题，但是这些系统几乎不利用语义数据和知识。本文提出了第一个可以无缝操作混合RDF数据集和文本语料库或单个来源的复杂问题的系统，在统一框架中进行操作。我们的方法称为UNIQORN，通过使用经过精细调整的BERT模型从RDF数据和/或文本语料库中检索与问题相关的证据来动态构建上下文图。结果图通常非常丰富但高度嘈杂。UNIQORN通过用于组Steiner树的图算法来处理这个输入，从而确定与问题相关的子图，进而回答问题。",
