    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑了一种结构变量选择问题，在这个问题中，协变量被预定义的群组划分，并且根据每个群组中的稀疏模式激活，每个群组仅有少数非零条目。利用原子范数的概念，可以设计出合适的复合范数以促进这种独占群组稀疏模式。由此产生的范数适用于高效和灵活的支持恢复正则化优化算法，如近端算法。此外，提出了一种主动集算法，通过逐步将结构原子包含到估计的支持中来构建解。还表明，这种算法可以针对比纯粹的独占群组稀疏性更严格的结构进行定制。渐近一致性分析（参数数量和群组数量随观察大小增长）在传统假设下证明了所提出解决方案在有符号支持恢复方面的有效性。最后，提出了一种改进的优化算法。",

The method promotes exclusive group sparsity patterns using a composite norm and utilizes efficient and flexible optimization algorithms for support recovery.
