    "translated_abstract": "程序翻译指将源代码从一种编程语言迁移到另一种编程语言。它在软件开发中具有巨大的实用价值，因为跨语言移植软件耗时且成本高昂。自动进行程序翻译在软件迁移中至关重要，最近研究人员由于找不到平行语料库而探索了无监督方法。然而，预先训练的编程语言语言模型的可用性使得用少量标记样本进行有监督的微调成为可能。因此，我们提出了AVATAR，包含9,515个使用两种流行语言（Java和Python）编写的编程问题及其解决方案的集合。AVATAR从竞技编程网站、在线平台和开源存储库中收集。此外，AVATAR还包含了250个示例的单元测试，以便进行功能正确性评估。我们对AVATAR微调了几个预训练语言模型并进行了基准测试。实验结果表明，微调的模型在程序翻译质量上明显优于无监督模型。AVATAR可以促进程序翻译模型的有监督学习，并作为评估无监督方法的基准。",
