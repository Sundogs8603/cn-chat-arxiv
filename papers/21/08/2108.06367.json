    "abstract": "Recommender systems (RecSys) have been well developed to assist user decision making. Traditional RecSys usually optimize a single objective (e.g., rating prediction errors or ranking quality) in the model. There is an emerging demand in multi-objective optimization recently in RecSys, especially in the area of multi-stakeholder and multi-task recommender systems. This article provides an overview of multi-objective recommendations, followed by the discussions with case studies.
