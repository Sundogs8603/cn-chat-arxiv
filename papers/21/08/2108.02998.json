    "translated_abstract": "主动脉血管树由主动脉及其分支动脉组成，在供应全身血液方面扮演着关键角色。主动脉疾病，如主动脉瘤或夹层，可能导致主动脉破裂，使用开放手术治疗极其危险。因此，患者通常接受药物治疗并进行持续监测，需要通过影像检查定期检查血管。用于诊断和监测的标准成像模式是计算机断层扫描（CT），如果加上对比剂（CTA），则可以提供主动脉及其分支血管的详细图像。最理想情况下，可以覆盖和比较来自连续CTA的整个主动脉血管树几何形状。这不仅可以检测主动脉的变化，还可以检测由主要病理或新发生的分支动脉引起的变化。手动重建此过程需要逐层勾画，可能需要一整天时间才能完成。",
