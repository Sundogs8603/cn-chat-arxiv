    "abstract": "The study compares the competitiveness of three Korean groups raised in different institutional environments: South Korea, North Korea, and China. Laboratory experiments reveal that North Korean refugees are less likely to participate in competitive tournaments than South Koreans and Korean-Chinese immigrants. Analysis using a choice model with probability weighting suggests that lower cognitive ability may lead to lower expected performance, more pessimistic beliefs, and greater aversion to competition.",

    "translated_abstract": "该研究比较了在不同制度环境下长大的三个韩国群体（韩国、朝鲜和中国）的竞争力。实验室实验发现，朝鲜难民相对于韩国人和韩国华人移民更不愿参加竞争比赛。通过使用概率加权的选择模型进行分析，研究表明较低的认知能力可能导致较低的预期表现、更悲观的信念和对竞争的更大逆感。",
