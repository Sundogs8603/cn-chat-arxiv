    "translated_abstract": "首先讨论了生态系统模拟器与通用人工智能之间的联系。随后我们介绍了基于Unity游戏引擎的开源生态系统模拟器Ecotwin，它可以运行包含无生命物体如山脉和湖泊以及包括动物和植物的生态系统。动物认知的建模是通过整合三个独立的网络来实现的：（i）硬连通的反射网络；（ii）幸福网络，用于将传感数据，如氧气、水、能量和气味，映射到一个标量幸福值；（iii）选择行动的策略网络。策略网络是通过强化学习（RL）进行训练的，其中奖励信号被定义为从一个时间步到下一个时间步的幸福差。所有的生物能够进行有性或无性繁殖，并且如果它们耗尽了关键资源，它们就会死亡。我们报告了使用Ecotwin进行的三个研究的结果，其中自然现象在模型中出现而无需硬编码。",
