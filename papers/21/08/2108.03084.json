    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于图神经网络（GNN）的社交事件检测任务显示出了良好的性能。然而，大多数研究都是面向具有大量训练样本的语言的单语言数据，这导致了更常见的多语言环境和更少使用的语言的相对较少研究。因此，我们提出了一种GNN，该网络结合跨语言词嵌入以便在多语言数据流中检测事件。首先的突破在于让GNN能够处理多语言数据。为此，我们概述了一种构建策略，该策略在节点和语义级别上对不同语言中的消息进行了对齐。通过合并相同但在不同语言中表示的实体来建立消息之间的关系。非英语消息表示通过跨语言词嵌入转换为英语语义空间。然后，GNN模型统一编码生成结果消息图。",
