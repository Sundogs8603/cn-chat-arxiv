An effective robot assistant must learn to handle diverse human behaviors shown in the demonstrations and be robust when the humans adjust their strategies during online task execution. Our method co-optimizes a human policy and a robot policy in an interactive learning process: the human policy learns to generate diverse and plausible collaborative behaviors from demonstrations while the robot policy learns to assist by estimating the unobserved latent strategy of its human collaborator. Across a 2D strategy game, a human-robot handover task, and a multi-step collaborative manipulation task, our method outperforms the alternatives in both simulated evaluations and when executing the tasks with a real human operator in-the-loop.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种从人-人协作示范中学习人机协作策略的方法。一个有效的机器人助手必须学会处理示范中展示的多样化的人类行为，并在在线任务执行过程中当人类调整策略时具有鲁棒性。我们的方法在交互式学习过程中共同优化人类策略和机器人策略：人类策略通过示范学习生成多样化和可信的协作行为，而机器人策略则通过估计其人类合作者未观测到的潜在策略来进行辅助。在2D策略游戏、人机交接任务和多步协作操纵任务中，我们的方法在模拟评估和与真实人类操作员一起执行任务时均优于替代方法。附加材料和视频请参见 https://sites.google.com/view/co-gail-web/home",
