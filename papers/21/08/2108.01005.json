    "translated_abstract": "连续学习的领域旨在通过与非稳态环境的交互来积累知识和技能，并开发算法。实际上，存在大量评估程序（设置）和算法解决方案（方法），每个解决方案都有其自己的假设集。这种多样性使连续学习的进展难以衡量。我们提出了一个设置的分类法，其中每个设置都被描述为一组假设。此视图的树形层次结构出现，其中更一般的设置成为具有更多限制性假设的设置的父级。这使得可以使用继承来共享和重用研究，因为为给定设置开发方法也使其直接适用于其任何子代。我们创建了一个名为Sequoia的公开可用软件框架，它具有来自连续监督学习（CSL）和连续强化学习（CRL）领域的各种设置，以及基准数据集、评估指标和最先进的方法。该框架旨在方便研究人员进行可扩展定制和扩展。通过Sequoia，我们旨在减少在孤立地开发方法和进行实验所产生的重复努力，并鼓励在连续学习上进行统一的研究。",
