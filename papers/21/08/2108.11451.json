    "translated_abstract": "本调查探讨了两个不同人工智能领域中学习和推理的集成方法：神经符号计算（NeSy）和统计关系人工智能（StarAI）。NeSy旨在将符号推理与神经网络相结合，而StarAI则专注于将逻辑与概率图模型相结合。该调查关注了两种方法之间的七个共同维度。这些维度用于对两种领域进行分类，包括：（1）逻辑推理方法，无论是基于模型还是基于证明；（2）逻辑理论的语法；（3）系统的逻辑语义及其扩展以促进学习；（4）学习的范围，包括仅涉及参数还是涉及整个逻辑理论；（5）表示法中符号和子符号成分的存在；（6）系统捕捉原始逻辑、概率和神经范例的程度；和（7）任务类别。",
