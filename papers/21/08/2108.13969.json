    "translated_abstract": "自动人群行为分析可以有效帮助日常交通统计和规划，从而促进智慧城市建设。 人群计数作为其中一个重要关键，吸引了越来越多的关注。 最近的研究取得了令人满意的性能，但依赖于昂贵的人群标注。 为了减轻在实际交通场景中的注释成本，在这项工作中，我们提出了一个半监督学习框架 $S^{4}\\textit{Crowd}$，可以利用无标签/有标签数据进行稳健的人群计数。 在无监督通道中，提出了两个\\textit{自监督损失}来模拟人群变化，如尺度，照明，基于此生成并逐渐完善了监督信息伪标签。 我们还提出了一种以人群为驱动的循环单元\\textit{Gated-Crowd-Recurrent-Unit（GCRU）}，可以保留鉴别信息。",
