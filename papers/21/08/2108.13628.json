    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑从观察数据中学习一个适度深度的最优处方树（即，以二叉树形式表示的可解释的治疗分配策略）的问题。这个问题在许多社会重要领域（如公共卫生和个性化医学）中是存在的，这些领域中通过被动收集数据来寻找基于数据的可解释和数据驱动干预，而不是通过随机试验。我们提出了一种使用混合整数优化（MIO）技术来学习最优处方树的方法。我们证明，在温和条件下，我们的方法是渐近精确的，即随着历史数据样本的数量趋向于无穷大，它收敛到一个最优的样本外治疗分配策略。与现有文献相反，我们的方法：1）不需要数据随机化，2）不对学习到的树施加严格的假设，3）具有建模领域特定问题的能力。",
