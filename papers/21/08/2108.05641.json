    "translated_abstract": "会话推荐系统的目的是根据先前的会话序列预测用户的下一次点击。目前的研究通常根据用户会话序列中的项目转换来学习用户偏好。然而，会话序列中的其他有效信息，如用户配置文件，往往被忽视，这可能导致模型无法学习用户的具体偏好。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于异构图神经网络的会话推荐方法，命名为SR-HetGNN，它可以通过异构图神经网络（HetGNN）学习会话嵌入，并捕捉匿名用户的特定偏好。具体而言，SR-HetGNN首先根据会话序列构建包含各种类型节点的异构图，可以捕捉项目、用户和会话之间的依赖关系。其次，HetGNN捕捉项目之间的复杂转换并学习包含项目嵌入的特征。",
