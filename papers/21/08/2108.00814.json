    "translated_abstract": "本研究调查了专利授予与信息通信技术（ICT）行业企业动态之间的因果关系，因为后者是现代经济中一个特殊的部门，常常受到反垄断当局的关注。为了达到我们的目的，我们利用了在2009-2017年间由39个国家的179,660家公司提供的财务账户和专利活动的匹配信息。首先，我们展示了样本中大公司不到总数的2%，但他们在分析期间获得的授权占89%。因此，我们测试了ICT行业专利授予对较小公司的市场份额和规模有显著而巨大的影响（分别为31.5%和30.7%），而对大公司的影响我们没有证据。通过一个新颖的工具变量策略，利用专利局一级的信息，我们证实了对较小公司的影响大部分都是正向的。",
