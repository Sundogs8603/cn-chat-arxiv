    "abstract": "Group deliberation enables people to collaborate and solve problems, however, it is understudied due to a lack of resources. To this end, we introduce the first publicly available dataset containing collaborative conversations on solving a well-established cognitive task, consisting of 500 group dialogues and 14k utterances. In 64% of these conversations, the group members are able to find a better solution than they had identified individually, and in 43.8% of the groups who had a correct answer as their final solution, none of the participants had solved the task correctly by themselves. Furthermore, we propose a novel annotation schema that captures deliberation cues and release all 14k utterances annotated with it. Finally, we use the proposed dataset to develop and evaluate two methods for generating deliberation utterances. The data collection platform, dataset and annotated corpus are publicly available at https://delibot.xyz.",

    "translated_abstract": "群体协商使人们能够协作解决问题，但由于缺乏资源，这方面的研究尚不完善。为此，我们引入了第一个公开可用的数据集，其中包含解决一个已经确立的认知任务的协作对话，包括500个小组对话和14k个话语。在这些对话中，64％的小组成员能够找到比他们单独找到的更好的解决方案，在最终解决方案为正确答案的小组中，有43.8％的小组中没有任何参与者自己就能正确解决任务。此外，我们提出了一种新的注释模式，捕捉协商线索，并公开了所有14k个注释过的话语。最后，我们使用提出的数据集开发和评估了两种生成协商话语的方法。数据收集平台、数据集和注释语料库可在https://delibot.xyz上公开获得。",
