    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了在线 3D 无序装箱问题，这是经典装箱问题的一个具有挑战性但实用价值的变种。在这个问题中，物品被递送到代理人处，但不提供完整的序列信息。代理人必须将这些物品直接稳定地装入目标装箱中，而不能改变它们的到达顺序，并且不允许进一步调整。在线 3D 无序装箱问题可以自然地被看作是一个马尔科夫决策过程（MDP）。我们采用深度强化学习，尤其是基于策略的演员-评论家框架，用受限动作空间来解决这个MDP 。为了学习一个实用的可行的装箱策略，我们提出了三个关键的设计。首先，我们提出了一种基于新的叠放树的装箱稳定性在线分析方法。它实现了高度的分析准确性，同时将计算复杂度从 O(N^2) 降低到 O(NlogN)，非常适合于 RL 训练。其次，我们提出了一种不同维度分离的装箱策略学习方法",
