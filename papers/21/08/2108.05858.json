    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种非线性差异中差异方法，用于在具有观察数据的经典处理和对照研究设计中估计多元反事实分布。我们的方法为现有方法带来了新的视角，如变更中的变更和经典半参数差异中差异估计量，并将它们推广到具有多元异质性结果的设置中。这一扩展的主要优点在于它允许联合结果中的任意依赖性和异质性。我们在合成数据和真实数据上展示了其实用性。特别是，我们重新审视了经典的Card \\& Krueger数据集，研究了最低工资增加对快餐店就业的影响；我们的方法的重新分析揭示，餐厅在最低工资提高后更快地将全职工人替换为兼职工人。本工作的先前版本标题未完整显示。",
