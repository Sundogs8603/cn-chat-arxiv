    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑从成对关联中估计一维环面上的潜在位置的问题。对于一对项之间的关联观测被建模为对潜在位置$x^*_{i},x^*_{j}$的函数$f(x^*_{i},x^*_{j})$的噪声观测。关联函数$f$是未知的，仅假设其满足一些形状约束，确保当$x$和$y$之间的距离较小时，$f(x,y)$较大，反之亦然。这种非参数化建模提供了适应数据的良好灵活性。我们引入了一种估计过程，能够以高概率的方式将所有潜在位置定位到最大误差为$\\sqrt{\\log(n)/n}$的范围内。这个速率被证明是最小化的。我们还对一种计算效率更高的变体进行了分析，该变体在一些更严格的假设下成立。我们的总体结果可以应用于统计排序问题，从而得到最大误差的新界限。",
