    "abstract": "A great deal of empirical research has examined who falls for misinformation and why. Here, we introduce a formal game-theoretic model of engagement with news stories that captures the strategic interplay between (mis)information consumers and producers. A key insight from the model is that observed patterns of engagement do not necessarily reflect the preferences of consumers. This is because producers seeking to promote misinformation can use strategies that lead moderately inattentive readers to engage more with false stories than true ones -- even when readers prefer more accurate over less accurate information. We then empirically test people's preferences for accuracy in the news. In three studies, we find that people strongly prefer to click and share news they perceive as more accurate -- both in a general population sample, and in a sample of users recruited through Twitter who had actually shared links to misinformation sites online. Despite this preference for accurate news ",

    "translated_abstract": "大量的实证研究探讨了谁会相信虚假信息以及为什么会相信虚假信息。在这篇论文中，我们介绍了一个形式化的博弈论模型，用于分析新闻故事和消费者、制作者之间的战略互动。该模型的关键洞察是观察到的参与模式不一定反映消费者的偏好。这是因为寻求推广虚假信息的制作者可以利用策略，使得稍微不够专注的读者更多地参与虚假故事而不是真实故事，即使读者更喜欢准确而非准确的信息。我们还对人们对新闻准确性的偏好进行了实证测试。在三个研究中，我们发现人们强烈倾向于点击和分享他们认为更准确的新闻，无论是在一般人群样本中还是在通过Twitter招募的实际分享了虚假新闻链接的用户样本中。",
