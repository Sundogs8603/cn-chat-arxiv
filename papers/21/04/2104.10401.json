    "translated_abstract": "车辆再识别通过区分相同和不同车辆的图像来实现识别。由于不同视角下相同车辆之间存在明显的内部差异以及相似车辆之间存在细微的外部差异，这是一个具有挑战性的过程。为解决这个问题，研究人员通过空间注意力机制提取视角感知或部分特定特征，但通常会导致嘈杂的注意力图或需要昂贵的额外注释元数据（如关键点）来提高质量。与此同时，基于研究人员的洞察力，已经提出了各种基于手工设计的特定视角或车辆部件的多注意力架构。然而，这种方法不能保证注意力分支的数量和性质对于现实世界的再识别任务是最优的。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种基于多软注意力机制的新车辆再识别网络。",
