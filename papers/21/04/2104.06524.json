    "translated_abstract": "在实际视频监控应用中，人员再识别（ReID）受到遮挡和检测错误的影响。尽管近年来取得了一些进展，但遮挡仍然会破坏最先进的CNN骨干提取的特征，并因此降低了ReID系统的准确性。为了解决这个问题，文献中的方法使用额外的昂贵过程，如姿态估计，其中姿态图提供监督来排除遮挡的区域。相反，我们提出了一种新颖的整体指导（HG）方法，只依赖于人的身份标签和数据集的配对匹配距离分布，以减轻遮挡问题，而无需额外的监督。因此，我们提出的学生-教师框架通过将遮挡样本的距离分布（DCD）与整体（非遮挡）样本的距离分布匹配来训练，从而解决了遮挡问题，并利用后者作为软约束。",
