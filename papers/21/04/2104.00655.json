    "abstract": "We conduct a simulation study of Local Projection (LP) and Vector Autoregression (VAR) estimators of structural impulse responses across thousands of data generating processes, designed to mimic the properties of the universe of U.S. macroeconomic data. Our analysis considers various identification schemes and several variants of LP and VAR estimators, employing bias correction, shrinkage, or model averaging. A clear bias-variance trade-off emerges: LP estimators have lower bias than VAR estimators, but they also have substantially higher variance at intermediate and long horizons. Bias-corrected LP is the preferred method if and only if the researcher overwhelmingly prioritizes bias. For researchers who also care about precision, VAR methods are the most attractive -- Bayesian VARs at short and long horizons, and least-squares VARs at intermediate and long horizons.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们对美国宏观经济数据的宇宙属性进行了模仿，考虑了各种识别方案和LP与VAR估计器的几个变体，包括偏差修正、收缩或模型平均。结果显示存在偏差-方差折衷：LP估计器的偏差较小，但在中期和长期视角下方差显著较高。只有当研究者过分关注偏差时，偏差修正的LP方法是首选。对于关注精确度的研究者来说，VAR方法是最有吸引力的选择。在短期和长期视角下，贝叶斯VAR是首选，而在中期和长期视角下，最小二乘VAR是首选。",
