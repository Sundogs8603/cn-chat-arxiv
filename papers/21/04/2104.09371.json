Deep learning has been very successful in non-linear modeling, but there has been little work done in the functional data setting. We propose two variations of our framework: a functional neural network with continuous hidden layers, called the Functional Direct Neural Network (FDNN), and a second version that utilizes basis expansions and continuous hidden layers, called the Functional Basis Neural Network (FBNN). Both are designed explicitly to exploit the structure inherent in functional data. To fit these models we derive a functional gradient based optimization algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed methods in handling complex functional models is demonstrated by comprehensive simulation studies and real data examples.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种基于神经网络的新型非线性函数数据模型。深度学习在非线性建模方面非常成功，但在函数数据设置方面却很少有研究。我们提出了两种变体：一种是具有连续隐藏层的函数神经网络，称为函数直接神经网络（FDNN），另一种则利用基扩展和连续隐藏层，称为基函数神经网络（FBNN）。两种变体都是设计用来显式利用函数数据中固有的结构。为了拟合这些模型，我们导出了一种基于函数梯度的优化算法。我们通过全面的模拟研究和实际数据示例展示了所提出方法在处理复杂函数模型方面的有效性。",
