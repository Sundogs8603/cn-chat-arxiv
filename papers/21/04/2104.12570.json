    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的算法，可以以非常快的速度求解线性方程组的解。该算法在其基本形式上非常简短，并且根据定义进行向量化，而内存分配需求很低，因为对于每一次迭代，仅利用给定输入矩阵$\\mathbf X$的一个维度。与现有方法相比，执行时间非常短，表现出超过$10^2$倍的加速比和较低的内存分配需求，尤其适用于非方阵线性方程组，其中方程数与特征数的比例较高（高瘦型方程组）或较低（宽型方程组）。准确性高且易于控制，数值结果突出了所提算法在计算时间、解的准确性和内存需求方面的效率。论文还包括了算法收敛性的理论证明，并将所提算法理论推广到特征选择。",
