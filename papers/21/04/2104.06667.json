    "translated_abstract": "近年来，半监督推断受到了广泛关注。除了中等规模的标记数据L，半监督设置还包括一个更大规模的未标记数据U。|U| >> |L|的设置，使得半监督推断不同于标准的缺失数据问题，因为其自然违反了所谓的“正性”或“重叠”假设。然而，大多数半监督文献都隐含地假设L和U的分布相等，即标签没有选择偏差。在允许选择偏差的缺失随机模型下，倾向性评分（PS）的衰减性质会不可避免地加剧了推断的挑战。我们针对一个原型问题，即响应均值的估计，填补了这一空白。我们提出了一种双重稳健的半监督平均值估计器，并对其渐近性质进行了全面的表征。只要结果或PS模型正确，所提出的估计器就是一致的。",
