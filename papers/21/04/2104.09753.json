    "translated_abstract": "离散事件系统（DES）已在实践中得到深入发展和应用，但DES中的状态复杂度仍然是需要创新方法更好地解决的重要问题。随着量子计算和量子控制的发展，一个自然的问题是通过量子计算模型模拟DES，并建立“量子离散事件系统”（QDES）。其动机是双重的：一方面，在利用量子计算机模拟和处理DES时，QDES具有潜在的应用价值，其中量子系统被用于模拟由离散事件驱动的状态演化；另一方面，对于模拟某些实际问题，QDES可能比DES具有更重要的优势，尤其是在状态复杂度方面。因此，本文旨在利用“量子有限状态自动机”（QFA）作为建模形式，建立QDES的基本框架，并建立并证明了QDES的监督控制定理。然后，我们提出了一个用于决定QDES状态可达性问题的多项式时间算法，并证明了在DES中使用的方法可以直接扩展到QDES。最后，我们提供了一些案例研究以说明所提出的QDES框架的有效性和潜在优势。",

Furthermore, a polynomial-time algorithm is presented to decide the state reachability problem for QDES, which can be directly extended to DES. The effectiveness and potential advantages of the proposed QDES framework are illustrated by several case studies."
