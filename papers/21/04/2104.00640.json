    "abstract": "Automated fact-checking systems in real-world scenarios must compare claims with retrieved evidence to predict the veracity. The retrieved evidence may not unambiguously support or refute the claim and yield diverse valid interpretations. Existing fact-checking datasets necessitate that models predict a single veracity label for each claim and lack the ability to manage such ambiguity. We present AmbiFC, a large-scale fact-checking dataset with realistic claims derived from real-world information needs. Our dataset contains fine-grained evidence annotations of passages from complete Wikipedia pages. We thoroughly analyze disagreements arising from ambiguous claims in AmbiFC, observing a strong correlation of annotator disagreement with their self-assessment and expert-annotated linguistic phenomena.

    "translated_abstract": "在实际场景中，自动化事实核查系统必须将声明与检索到的证据进行比较以预测真实性。检索到的证据可能无法明确支持或反驳声明，并产生各种有效解释。现有的事实核查数据集需要模型为每个声明预测单个真实性标签，并且缺乏管理此类模糊性的能力。我们提出了一个大规模的事实核查数据集AmbiFC，其中包含从完整维基百科页面中获取的经过细粒度证据注释的信息需求的现实声明。我们彻底分析了AmbiFC中涉及含糊声明引起的争议，观察到与注释人员的自我评估和专家注释的语言现象强烈相关的注释人员争议。我们引入基于证据的含糊声明的真实性核查任务，比较了三种方法，其中包含注释信号和单标签分类。",

Through fine-grained evidence annotations and analysis, the study proposes a method for evidence-based fact-checking with soft labels for ambiguous claims, and identifies correlations in annotator disagreements through linguistic phenomena and self-assessment."
