    "translated_abstract": "将区块链引入联邦学习中，构建一个可信的边缘计算环境来进行传输和学习已经引起了广泛关注，作为一种新的分布式学习模式。然而，传统的区块链系统的共识机制和架构在处理大规模联邦学习任务，特别是在物联网设备上，面临着重大挑战，由于它们的资源消耗、交易吞吐量有限和复杂的通信需求。为了解决这些挑战，本文提出了ChainFL，一个创新的基于两层区块链的联邦学习系统。它将物联网网络分割成多个分片，并在子链层内有效地减少了信息交换规模，并使用基于有向无环图（DAG）的主链作为主链层，实现了并行和异步的跨分片验证。此外，联邦学习过程被定制化以与区块链技术深度整合，还提出了一种修改过的DAG...",
