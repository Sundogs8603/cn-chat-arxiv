    "translated_abstract": "ROC下面积（AUROC）和精确率-召回曲线下面积（AUPRC）是用于评估不平衡问题分类性能的常见指标。与AUROC相比，AUPRC是高度不平衡数据集的更合适的指标。虽然关于AUROC的随机优化已得到广泛研究，但基于原则的AUPRC的随机优化却很少探索。本文提出了一种基于最大化平均精度（AP）的技术方法来优化深度学习的AUPRC的方法。我们将目标表示为依赖组合函数之和，其中内部函数依赖于外层的随机变量。我们通过利用随机组合优化的最新进展，提出了高效的自适应和非自适应随机算法SOAP，这些算法在温和条件下具有可证收敛性保证。在图像和图形数据集上进行了广泛的实验结果。",
