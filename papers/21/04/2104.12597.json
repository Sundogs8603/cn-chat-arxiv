    "translated_abstract": "异方差鲁棒性标准误差的检验是计量经济学实践中的重要技术。然而，选择正确的临界值并不简单：基于渐近理论的常规临界值往往会导致严重的大小失真；现有的调整方法，包括自助法，也存在相同问题。为了避免这些问题，本文建议使用最小的控制大小的临界值，我们在本文中证明了这些临界值在常用的检验统计量中的存在性。此外，我们给出了易于检查的足够条件和通常也是必要条件。如果这些临界值存在，它们是规范的选择：更大的临界值会导致不必要的功率损失，而更小的临界值会在零假设下过度拒绝，增加虚假发现的可能性，因此是无效的。我们建议使用算法来数值确定所提出的临界值，并提供了相应的实现。",
