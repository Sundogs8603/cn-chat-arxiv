    "translated_abstract": "点云完全标注耗时昂贵。随着拥有数十亿点的大型点云数据集变得更加普遍，我们是否有必要进行完整注释？实验证明，即使面对1％随机点注释，基于完全注释假设设计的现有基线也只会略微下降。然而，超过这个点，例如在0.1％注释处，分割准确性是不可接受的。由于点云是3D世界的样本，局部邻域内点的分布相对均匀，展现出强烈的语义相似性。基于此，我们提出了一种新的弱监督方法来隐式增强高度稀疏的监督信号。广泛的实验表明，所提出的Semantic Query Network（SQN）在弱监督方案下在七个大规模开放数据集上取得了良好的性能，仅需要0.1％的随机注释点进行训练，极大地降低了完整点云注释的时间和成本。",
