    "abstract": "Workplace communications around the world were drastically altered by Covid-19, related work-from-home orders, and the rise of remote work. To understand these shifts, we analyzed aggregated, anonymized metadata from over 360 billion emails within 4,361 organizations worldwide. By comparing month-to-month and year-over-year metrics, we examined changes in network community structures over 24 months before and after Covid-19. We also examined shifts across multiple communication media (email, instant messages, video calls, and calendaring software) within a single global organization, and compared them to communications shifts that were driven by changes in formal organizational structure. We found that, in 2020, organizations around the world became more siloed than in 2019, evidenced by increased modularity. This shift was concurrent with decreased stability within silos.

    "translated_abstract": "COVID-19，相关的居家办公政策和远程工作的兴起，极大地改变了世界各地的工作场所沟通方式。为了了解这些变化，我们分析了来自全球4361个组织的3600亿封电子邮件的聚合、匿名化元数据。通过比较每月和年度的指标，我们对COVID-19之前和之后24个月内网络社群结构的变化进行了研究。我们还研究了单个全球组织内多种沟通媒体（电子邮件、即时消息、视频通话和日历软件）的变化，并将其与由于组织结构改变而推动的沟通变化进行了比较。我们发现，在2020年，世界各地的组织比2019年更加孤立，表现为增加的模块化。这一转变与模块内稳定性的降低同时发生。我们的分析共同表明，COVID-19爆发后，员工开始更加灵活地进行沟通。",
