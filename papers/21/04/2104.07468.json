    "translated_abstract": "数据共享仍然是普遍采用新型人工智能技术的主要障碍，尤其是在农食品行业。在这种情况下，数据的保密性是很自然的，因为数据是数据所有者的宝贵资产，需恰当地使用才能为其提供有用的运营和流程洞察，从而获得竞争优势。不幸的是，许多新型人工智能技术需要大量的训练数据才能执行得好，而在许多情况下这是不现实的。然而，最近的机器学习进展，例如联邦学习和隐私保护技术，可以通过提供基础设施和支持技术，使用来自各种来源的数据来训练模型，而不必共享原始数据本身。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于联邦学习的技术解决方案，利用分散的数据（即未被交换或共享但保留给交易伙伴的数据），以构建更好的机器学习模型在农食品行业。我们展示了我们的方法如何提高模型的质量并减少所需的数据量。我们提出的跨边界联邦学习框架促进了不同组织之间的数据共享，同时确保了数据贡献者的隐私和安全。",
