    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习中，$\\mathsf{SHAP}$-score是Shapley值的一个版本，用于通过给每个特征分配一个得分来解释学习模型在特定实体上的结果。虽然计算Shapley值通常是一个难以处理的问题，但我们证明了一项强有力的正面结果，即对于确定性和可分解的布尔电路，可以在多项式时间内计算$\\mathsf{SHAP}$-score。这些电路在知识编译领域中得到研究，广泛推广了各种布尔电路和二进制决策图类，包括二进制决策树和有序二进制决策图（OBDD）。我们还通过观察发现，在一个布尔模型类上计算$\\mathsf{SHAP}$-score总是和该类的模型计数问题一样困难的多项式问题。这意味着我们考虑的电路的确定性和可分解性都是必要的属性。这还意味着，除非NP=#P，否则计算大多数机器学习模型的$\\mathsf{SHAP}$-scores是计算上困难的。",
