    "translated_abstract": "相机图像信号处理 (ISP) 管道可以在不同的图像信号处理任务中获得令人满意的结果。然而，大多数这些方法，包括采用编码器-解码器深度架构的方法，通常会使用一致应用于整个图像的统一滤波器。然而，自然地将相机图像视为异质的，因为颜色强度和人工噪声分布在单个图像的二维域内都存在巨大的差异。各种各样的莫尔环，运动模糊，褪色或基于镜头的投影失真都有可能导致异质图像伪影滤波问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种特定的基于补丁的局部子空间深度神经网络，改进了相机ISP的鲁棒性，使其对异质伪影（特别是图像降噪）具有更好的效果。我们将我们的三重深度训练模型称为补丁子空间学习自动编码器 (PSL-AE)。",
