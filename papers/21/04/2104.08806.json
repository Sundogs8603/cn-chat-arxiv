    "translated_abstract": "语音情感识别是任何以人为中心的系统的重要组成部分。但一个人产生和感知的语音特征可能受到多种原因的影响，包括可取的情感和不可取的噪声。为了训练稳健的情感识别模型，我们需要一个大而真实的数据分布，但情感数据集往往很小，因此需要增加噪声。通常，噪声增强会做出一个重要的假设，即在有或无噪声的情况下，预测标签应保持不变。这对于自动语音识别来说是正确的，但对于基于感知的任务来说却未必正确。在本文中，我们做出了三个创新贡献。我们通过众包验证了噪声的存在确实会改变注释标签，从而可能改变原始的真实标签。然后，我们展示了忽视这一知识并假设真实标签的一致性会对机器学习模型的下游评估产生影响。",
