Linking weights to characteristics to form optimal portfolios suffers from estimation error which we mitigate by maximizing an in-sample loss function that is more concave than the utility function. While no single characteristic can be used to enhance utility by all investors, conditioning on momentum, size, and residual volatility produces portfolios with significantly higher certainty equivalents than benchmarks for all investors. Characteristic complementarities produce the benefits, for example momentum mitigates overfitting inherent in other characteristics. Optimal portfolios' returns lie largely outside the span of traditional factors.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文通过离样本外效用函数的视角分析特征的联合预测信息。我们通过最大化样本内损失函数来减轻特征权重估计误差，该损失函数比效用函数更凹。尽管没有单一特征可以提高所有投资者的效用，但在动力、大小和残差波动率的条件下，形成的投资组合的确定等价值显著高于基准值。特征的互补作用带来了这些好处，例如动力减轻了其他特征固有的过度拟合。最优组合的回报在很大程度上超出了传统因子的范围。",
