    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种近似贝叶斯推断的框架，当由于计算限制而只能获得有限数量的含有噪声的对数似然评估时，这在复杂模型的应用中越来越常见。我们使用高斯过程（GP）对对数似然函数进行建模，主要的方法创新是将该模型应用于模拟精确的Metropolis-Hastings（MH）采样器如果适用的话将会采取的路径。使用顺序实验设计策略选择具有信息量的对数似然评估位置，直到根据GP模型准确地完成MH接受/拒绝决策。得到的近似采样器在概念上简单且样本效率高。与早期相关的“类贝叶斯优化”方法相比，它对GP建模假设的违反更具鲁棒性，该方法专为贝叶斯推断而设计。我们讨论了一些理论方面和各种结果的解释。",
