To address this gap, we propose a novel challenge of reasoning with circumstantial preconditions. We collect a dataset, called PaCo, consisting of 12.4 thousand preconditions of commonsense statements expressed in natural language. Based on this dataset, we create three canonical evaluation tasks and use them to examine the capability of existing LMs to understand situational preconditions. Our results reveal a 10-30% gap between machine and human performance on our tasks, which shows that reasoning with preconditions is an open challenge.",

    "translated_abstract": "人类可以无缝地推理常识知识的环境前提条件。我们知道一个玻璃是用来喝水的，除非玻璃破碎或水有毒。尽管最先进的语言模型在推断常识知识方面有着令人印象深刻的表现，但它们是否理解环境前提条件尚不清楚。为了解决这一差距，我们提出了一种新颖的具有环境前提的推理挑战。我们收集了一个名为PaCo的数据集，其中包含以自然语言表达的12.4千个常识陈述的前提条件。基于该数据集，我们创建了三个经典评估任务，并使用它们来检验现有语言模型理解情境前提条件的能力。我们的结果显示在这些任务上机器和人类的表现存在10-30%的差距，这表明推理前提条件是一个未解决的挑战。",
