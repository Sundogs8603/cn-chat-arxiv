    "abstract": "In this paper we study pricing of American put options on the Black and Scholes market with a stochastic interest rate and finite-time maturity. We prove that the option value is a $C^1$ function of the initial time, interest rate and stock price. By means of Ito calculus we rigorously derive the option value's early exercise premium formula and the associated hedging portfolio. We prove the existence of an optimal exercise boundary splitting the state space into continuation and stopping region. The boundary has a parametrisation as a jointly continuous function of time and stock price, and it is the unique solution to an integral equation which we compute numerically. Our results hold for a large class of interest rate models including CIR and Vasicek models. We show a numerical study of the option price and the optimal exercise boundary for Vasicek model.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在具有随机利率和有限期的Black-Scholes市场上对美式看涨期权的定价。我们证明了期权价值是初始时刻、利率和股票价格的$C^1$函数。通过Ito积分计算，我们严格推导了期权价值的提前行权溢价公式和相应的对冲组合。我们证明了存在一个最优行权边界将状态空间分为继续和停止区域。该边界具有时间和股票价格的联合连续函数的参数表示，并且是一个我们可以进行数值计算的积分方程的唯一解。我们的结果适用于包括CIR和Vasicek模型在内的一大类利率模型。我们展示了对Vasicek模型期权价格和最优行权边界的数值研究。",
