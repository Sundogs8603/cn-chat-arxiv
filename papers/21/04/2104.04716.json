    "abstract": "We develop a new method for selecting the penalty parameter for $\\ell_1$-penalized M-estimators in high dimensions, which we refer to as bootstrapping after cross-validation. We derive rates of convergence for the corresponding $\\ell_1$-penalized M-estimator and also for the post-$\\ell_1$-penalized M-estimator, which refits the non-zero parameters of the former estimator without penalty in the criterion function. We demonstrate via simulations that our method is not dominated by cross-validation in terms of estimation errors and outperforms cross-validation in terms of inference. As an illustration, we revisit Fryer Jr (2019), who investigated racial differences in police use of force, and confirm his findings.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一种新的方法，用于在高维情况下选择$\\ell_1$-惩罚M-估计器的惩罚参数，我们称之为交叉验证后的自助法。我们推导了相应的$\\ell_1$-惩罚M-估计器的收敛速度，以及在准则函数中不使用惩罚重新拟合前一估计器的非零参数的后-$\\ell_1$-惩罚M-估计器的收敛速度。通过模拟实验证明，我们的方法在估计误差方面不被交叉验证所主导，并且在推断方面胜过交叉验证。作为示例，我们重新审视了Fryer Jr (2019)关于警察使用武力的种族差异的研究，并确认了他的发现。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a new method called bootstrapping after cross-validation for selecting penalty parameters of high-dimensional M-estimators. Simulations show that this method outperforms cross-validation in terms of estimation errors and inference. The study also revalidates the findings of Fryer Jr (2019) on racial differences in police use of force."
