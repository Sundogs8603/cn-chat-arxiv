    "abstract": "We aim to develop an English-to-Yoruba machine translation system which can translate English verb phrase text to its Yoruba equivalent.Words from both languages Source Language and Target Language were collected for the verb phrase group in the home domain. The lexical translation is done by assigning values of the matching word in the dictionary. The syntax of the two languages was realized using Context-Free Grammar, we validated the rewrite rules with finite state automata. The human evaluation method was used and expert fluency was scored. The evaluation shows the system performed better than that of sampled Google translation with over 70 percent of the response matching that of the system's output.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在开发一种英语到约鲁巴语的机器翻译系统，可以将英语动词短语文本翻译成约鲁巴语。在家庭领域收集了源语言和目标语言的动词短语组的词汇，并通过在词典中分配匹配词的值来完成词汇翻译。使用上下文无关文法实现了两种语言的句法，我们使用有限状态自动机验证了重写规则。采用人工评估方法并对专家流畅度进行评分。评估结果显示，该系统的输出与样本谷歌翻译的响应匹配率超过70%。",
