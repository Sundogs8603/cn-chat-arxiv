    "abstract": "How cooperation evolves and manifests itself in the thermodynamic or infinite player limit of social dilemma games is a matter of intense speculation. Various analytical methods have been proposed to analyze the thermodynamic limit of social dilemmas. In this work, we compare two analytical methods, i.e., Darwinian evolution and Nash equilibrium mapping, with a numerical agent-based approach. For completeness, we also give results for another analytical method, Hamiltonian dynamics. In contrast to Hamiltonian dynamics, which involves the maximization of payoffs of all individuals, in Darwinian evolution, the payoff of a single player is maximized with respect to its interaction with the nearest neighbor. While the Hamiltonian dynamics method utterly fails as compared to Nash equilibrium mapping, the Darwinian evolution method gives a false positive for game magnetization -- the net difference between the fraction of cooperators and defectors -- when payoffs obey the condition a + d = b",

    "translated_abstract": "如何在社交困境游戏的热力学或无穷大参与者限制条件下合作如何演化和显现出来是一个引起强烈推测的问题。已经提出了各种分析方法来分析社交困境的热力学极限。在这项工作中，我们将两种分析方法，即达尔文进化论和Nash均衡映射与数值代理模型进行了比较。为了完整性，我们还给出了另一种分析方法，即哈密顿动力学的结果。与涉及最大化所有个体收益的哈密顿动力学不同，达尔文进化论方法是针对与最近邻个体之间的互动最大化单个玩家的收益。与Nash均衡映射相比，哈密顿动力学方法完全失败，而达尔文进化论方法在支付满足条件a + d = b时对于游戏磁化率——合作者和缺乏合作者之间比例的净差异——给出了一个错误的正面结果。",
