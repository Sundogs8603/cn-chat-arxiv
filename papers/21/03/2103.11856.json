    "translated_abstract": "单个学习算法在给定数据上能解决多少个不同的二进制分类问题，其中要求交叉验证错误为零或最多给定数量？在前一种情况下，根据无免费午餐定理，这个数量是有限的，我们表明精确答案由误差检测码理论给出。作为案例研究，我们关注AUC性能度量和留一对交叉验证(LPOCV)，其中每个可能具有不同类标签的数据对都会被暂时保留。我们发现，对于固定类比例的分类问题，学习算法能够实现零LPOCV错误的最大数量等于常权码(CWC)中的最大码字数量，具有一定的技术性质。然后，我们通过引入轻量级常权码(light CWC)来推广CWC，并证明了对于非零LPOCV错误和轻量级常权码的类似结果。此外，我们对码字数量的最大上界和最大下界也进行了证明。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores the connection between coding theory and cross-validation, and reveals that the number of different binary classification problems a learning algorithm can solve on fixed data is closely related to error detecting codes. The study focuses on a specific cross-validation method and shows that the maximal number of classification problems depends on the number of code words in a certain type of code. Additionally, the concept of lightweight codes is introduced, and similar results are derived for different cross-validation errors."
