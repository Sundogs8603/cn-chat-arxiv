    "abstract": "Product personalization opens the door to price discrimination. A rich product line allows firms to better tailor products to consumers' tastes, but the mere choice of a product carries valuable information about consumers that can be leveraged for price discrimination. We study this trade-off in an upstream-downstream model, where a consumer buys a good of variable quality upstream, followed by an indivisible good downstream. The downstream firm's use of the consumer's purchase history for price discrimination introduces a novel distortion: The upstream firm offers a subset of the products that it would offer if, instead, it could jointly design its product line and downstream pricing. By controlling the degree of product personalization the upstream firm curbs ratcheting forces that result from the consumer facing downstream price discrimination.",

    "translated_abstract": "产品个性化打开了价格歧视的大门。丰富的产品线使企业能够更好地根据消费者的口味定制产品，但选择产品本身就包含着有价值的消费者信息，这些信息可以被用来进行价格歧视。我们在一个上游-下游模型中研究了这种权衡，其中消费者先购买上游的可变质量商品，然后购买不可分割的下游商品。下游公司利用消费者的购买历史进行价格歧视引入了一种新的扭曲：上游公司提供的产品子集如果能够联合设计产品线和下游定价，将会有不同选择。通过控制产品个性化程度，上游公司抑制了由消费者面临下游价格歧视产生的推高力量。",
