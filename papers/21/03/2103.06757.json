    "translated_abstract": "自适应软件系统根据执行环境中的内部和外部变化不断进行适应，这些变化以上下文形式捕捉。上下文导向编程（COP）提出了一种用于开发自适应系统的技术，它使用专门的编程语言构造来捕捉其主要特征。COP适应性通过指定独立的模块在基本系统内外进行组合，以响应来自周围环境的感知情况而激活和停用上下文来进行定义。然而，适应性、上下文和相关的特殊行为的定义需要在设计阶段指定。在复杂的CPS中，由于新的不可预测的工作条件，这是难以处理的。我们提出了Auto-COP，一种新的技术，可以在运行时生成适应性。Auto-COP使用RL选项构建动作序列，基于之前系统执行的实例。通过与环境的交互来探索选项，并选择最合适的选项。",
