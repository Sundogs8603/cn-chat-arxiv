    "translated_abstract": "对于真实的图数据，节点之间的复杂关系通常被表示为硬性二进制链接。显然，这是一种离散和简化的连续关系形式，严重限制了学习到的节点表示的可表达性。另一方面，嵌入空间中获得的节点表示可以反过来揭示节点之间的内在关系。为了更好地特征化节点关系并进一步促进节点表示的学习，一种直观的方法是使用嵌入的节点表示来细化最初给定的图结构。但是，全局细化所有节点之间的关系无法区分将不可避免地导致一些噪声边缘，这可能进一步混淆节点表示学习模型的训练。此外，大型图形上也存在可扩展性问题。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种局部结构感知的图形细化方法，利用已经学到的节点表示逐步改善图形结构质量。具体而言，我们首先通过对图中的随机游走模拟生成一个多样化的邻域结构集。然后，对于每个模拟邻域，我们在整个细化过程中保持邻域结构的多样性，同时细化邻域内的节点关系。在各种基准数据集上进行的评估实验结果表明，所提出的方法在多个下游任务上，包括节点分类、链接预测和图聚类，均优于现有最先进的方法。",
