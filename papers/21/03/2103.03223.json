    "translated_abstract": "量化是指在数据集中预测类别分布的问题。它也代表着一个在监督式机器学习中不断发展的研究领域，近年来提出了大量不同的算法。然而，目前还没有一份全面的实证比较量化方法的研究，以支持算法选择。在本研究中，我们通过对超过40个数据集进行了24种不同量化方法的彻底实证性性能比较，包括二分类和多分类量化设置，填补了这一研究空白。我们观察到没有单一算法能够在所有竞争对手中始终表现最佳，但我们确定了一组在二分类设置中表现最佳的方法，包括基于阈值选择的Median Sweep和TSMax方法、DyS框架和弗里德曼的方法。对于多分类设置，我们观察到另一组算法表现良好，包括Generaliz方法。",
