    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了以完成时间为权重的成功度量（SCT），这是一种评估移动机器人导航性能的新指标。许多与导航相关的研究使用以路径长度为权重的成功度量（SPL）作为评估代理到达目标位置路径的主要方法，但是SPL在评估具有复杂动态特性的代理时存在局限性。相比之下，SCT明确考虑了代理的动态模型，并旨在准确捕捉代理模拟其动态所允许的最快导航行为的程度。虽然一些行动导航作品使用点转动力学模型，但我们专注于使用单轮小车动态模型来设计我们的代理，这更好地展示了流行的移动机器人平台（例如LoCoBot，TurtleBot，Fetch等）的动态模型。我们还提出了一种针对单轮小车动力学的RRT*-Unicycle算法，该算法估计从起始位姿到目标位置的最快无碰撞路径和完成时间。",

We also introduce an algorithm, RRT*-Unicycle, which estimates the fastest collision-free path and completion time using unicycle dynamics. This metric accurately captures how well the agent approximates the fastest navigation behavior and overcomes the limitations of previous methods."
