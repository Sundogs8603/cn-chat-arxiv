    "translated_abstract": "受到人类掌握算术并将其推广到新问题的例外能力的启发，我们提出了一个新的数据集Handwritten arithmetic with INTegers（HINT）来检验机器学习通用概念的能力，包括感知、语法和语义三个层次。在HINT中，机器被赋予学习如何从原始信号（如图像）中感知概念（即感知），如何将多个概念结构化组合以形成有效表达式（即语法），以及如何实现概念以支持各种推理任务（即语义），全部在弱监督的情况下。我们专注于系统化通用能力，精心设计了一个五倍交叉测试集，以评估关于三层级别的学习概念的插值和外推。此外，我们还设计了一个少样本学习分割，以确定模型是否能够快速学习新概念并将其推广到更复杂的情况。为了了解现有模型的局限性，我们还对几种最先进的模型进行了广泛实验，并详细分析了它们在HINT上的表现。",
