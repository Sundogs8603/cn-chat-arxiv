    "translated_abstract": "决策树是最流行的机器学习模型之一，广泛应用于从收益管理和医学到生物信息学的各种应用中。本文考虑了学习具有单变量分割的最优二进制分类树的问题。近年来，该领域的文献大量涌现，既受到启发式方法经验性次优性的推动，也受到混合整数优化（MIO）技术的巨大改进的推动。然而，现有的基于MIO的方法没有充分发挥MIO的威力：它们依赖于弱的形式，导致收敛速度慢且存在较大优化间隙。为了填补文献中的这一空白，我们提出了一种直观的基于流的MIO形式来学习最优二进制分类树。我们的形式可以适应侧约束，以实现可解释和公平的决策树设计。此外，我们还展示了我们的形式具有更强的线性优化能力。",
