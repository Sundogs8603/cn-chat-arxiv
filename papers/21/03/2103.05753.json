Our path forward is to present a design for developmentally-inspired learning agents based on Braitenberg Vehicles. Using these agents to exemplify the embodied nature of computational autonomy, we move closer to modeling embodied experience and morphogenetic growth as components of cognitive developmental capacity. We consider biological and cognitive development which influence the generation of adult phenotypes and the contingency of available developmental pathways. Continual developmental neurosimulation allows us to consider the role of developmental trajectories in bridging the related phenomena of nervous system morphogenesis, developmental learning, and plasticity. Being closely tied to continual learning, our approach is tightly integrated with developmental embodiment, and can be implemented using a type of agent called developmental Braitenberg Vehicles (dBVs).

    "translated_abstract": "通过综合发育生物学、认知科学和计算建模，我们可以获得很多知识。我们的研究目标是基于Braitenberg Vehicles设计开发受发育启发的学习代理。利用这些代理体现了计算自主性的具身特性，不断靠近对具身经验和形态发生增长作为认知发展能力组成部分的建模。我们考虑生物和认知发展对成年表型生成和可用发展路径的影响。持续发展神经仿真使我们能够考虑发育轨迹在连接神经系统形态发生、发育学习和可塑性等相关现象中所起的作用。由于与持续学习紧密相关，我们的方法与发育具身紧密集成，可以使用一种称为发育Braitenberg Vehicles (dBVs)的代理来实现。",
