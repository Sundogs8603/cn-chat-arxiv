    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了使用提出的二进制展开近似均匀性（BEAUTY）方法的无分布拟合优度检验。该方法推广了著名的欧拉公式，并通过期望的二进制交互的线性组合来逼近任何联合分布函数的特征函数。这个新颖的理论通过特定的二次对称统计的逼近，将许多重要的独立性检验统一起来，其中确定性权重矩阵表征每个检验的功效性质。为了获得稳健的功效，我们使用数据自适应权重来检验检验统计量，称为二进制展开自适应对称性检验（BEAST）。利用二进制展开过程的性质，我们证明了均匀性的Neyman-Pearson检验可以通过oracle加权和的对称性统计量来近似。具有这个oracle的BEAST提供了可行功效的参考。",
