    "translated_abstract": "近年来，图神经网络(GNNs)在图学习社区中引起了极大的关注，并在各个领域的实际应用中被广泛采用，比如社交网络和生物图。然而，图深度学习的研究和应用存在一些新的挑战，包括图数据稀疏性、GNN复杂的训练和图任务的非标准评估。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了CogDL，一个图深度学习的综合库，允许研究人员和实践者轻松高效地进行实验、比较方法和构建应用。在CogDL中，我们提出了对于各种图任务的GNN模型训练和评估的统一设计，使其在现有的图学习库中独树一帜。通过使用这个统一的训练器，CogDL可以优化GNN训练循环，采用混合精度训练等多种训练技术。此外，我们针对各种GNN模型开发了高效且可扩展的实现，包括经典模型和最新的模型。此外，CogDL提供了一系列的实用工具和工具，支持图深度学习的开发，如数据加载器和评估指标。我们还通过在流行图数据集上的广泛实验证明了CogDL的有效性，并为各种图任务提供了全面的基准。",
