    "abstract": "We consider an optimal liquidation problem with instantaneous price impact and stochastic resilience for small instantaneous impact factors. Within our modelling framework, the optimal portfolio process converges to the solution of an optimal liquidation problem with general semimartingale controls when the instantaneous impact factor converges to zero. Our results provide a unified framework within which to embed the two most commonly used modelling frameworks in the liquidation literature and provide a microscopic foundation for the use of semimartingale liquidation strategies and the use of portfolio processes of unbounded variation. Our convergence results are based on novel convergence results for BSDEs with singular terminal conditions and novel representation results of BSDEs in terms of uniformly continuous functions of forward processes.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了具有瞬时价格冲击和随机弹性的最优清算问题，针对小瞬时冲击因子。在我们的建模框架中，当瞬时冲击因子趋近于零时，最优组合流程收敛到了具有一般半鞅控制的最优清算问题的解。我们的结果提供了一个统一的框架，将流动性文献中最常用的两种建模框架嵌入其中，并为使用半鞅清算策略和无界变动的组合流程的使用提供了微观基础。我们的收敛结果基于具有奇异末端条件的BSDE的新的收敛结果和BSDE的新的表示结果，这些结果是由均匀连续函数关于前向过程表示的。",
