Contextual MAB is an effective tool for many real applications, such as content recommendation and online advertisement. In practice, user dependency plays an essential role in the user's actions, and thus the rewards. Clustering similar users can improve the quality of reward estimation, which in turn leads to more effective content recommendation and targeted advertising. Different from traditional clustering settings, we cluster users based on the unknown bandit parameters, which will be estimated incrementally. In particular, we define the problem of cluster detection in contextual MAB, and propose a bandit algorithm, LOCB, embedded with local clustering procedure. And, we provide theoretical analysis about LOCB in terms of the correctness and efficiency of clustering and its regret bound. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm from various aspects, which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在上下文多臂赌博机（MAB）中识别用户聚类的问题。上下文MAB是许多实际应用的有效工具，例如内容推荐和在线广告。在实践中，用户依赖关系在用户的行为和奖励中起着至关重要的作用。对类似用户进行聚类可以提高奖励估计的质量，从而实现更有效的内容推荐和定向广告。不同于传统聚类设置，我们基于未知的赌博机参数对用户进行聚类，这些参数将被逐步估计。特别地，我们定义了上下文MAB中的聚类检测问题，并提出了一种嵌入本地聚类过程的赌博算法LOCB。我们对LOCB的聚类正确性和效率以及其遗憾界进行了理论分析。最后，我们从各个方面评估了所提出的算法，结果表明其优于最先进的基线算法。",
