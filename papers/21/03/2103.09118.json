    "abstract": "There are demographic biases present in current facial recognition (FR) models. To measure these biases across different ethnic and gender subgroups, we introduce our Balanced Faces in the Wild (BFW) dataset. This dataset allows for the characterization of FR performance per subgroup. We found that relying on a single score threshold to differentiate between genuine and imposters sample pairs leads to suboptimal results. Additionally, performance within subgroups often varies significantly from the global average. Therefore, specific error rates only hold for populations that match the validation data. To mitigate imbalanced performances, we propose a novel domain adaptation learning scheme that uses facial features extracted from state-of-the-art neural networks. This scheme boosts the average performance and preserves identity information while removing demographic knowledge. Removing demographic knowledge prevents potential biases from affecting decision-making and protects privacy ",

    "translated_abstract": "当前的人脸识别模型存在人口统计偏见。为了衡量不同族群和性别子群之间的这些偏见，我们引入了我们的平衡野外面孔数据集（BFW）。该数据集允许对每个子群的人脸识别性能进行描述。我们发现，依赖单一分数阈值来区分真实和冒名顶替者样本对会导致次优结果。此外，子群内的性能往往与全局平均值有明显差异。因此，特定的错误率仅适用于与验证数据匹配的人群。为了减轻不平衡的性能，我们提出了一种新颖的域自适应学习方案，该方案利用从最先进的神经网络中提取的面部特征。该方案提高了平均性能，并在去除人口统计知识的同时保留了身份信息。去除人口统计知识可以防止潜在的偏见影响决策，并保护隐私。",
