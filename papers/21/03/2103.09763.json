    "translated_abstract": "现有的生存分析技术往往依赖于强大的建模假设，因此容易出现模型错误。本文提出了一种基于拟合预测思想的推论方法，该方法可以包裹任何生存预测算法，产生校准、基于协变量的生存时间的下界预测。在类型I右截尾设定下，当剪除时间是完全外生的时，这些下界预测在有限样本中具有保证的覆盖率，除了独立同分布的数据点这一假设外，无需任何其他假设。在更一般的条件独立剪除假设下，如果剪除机制或条件生存函数估计良好，则边际覆盖率将近乎保证。此外，我们证明当生存预测算法被错误地规定时，这些下界预测仍然有效且信息丰富。通过模拟实验和医学真实数据集的分析，我们证明了这种方法的实用性。",
