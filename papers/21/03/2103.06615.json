    "translated_abstract": "近年来，机器人操纵方面取得了显着进展，但处理非刚性物体（如布料）仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。与非刚性物体进行物理交互是不确定和复杂的建模。因此，从样本数据中提取有用信息可以极大地提高建模性能。然而，由于状态表示的高维性，这种模型的训练是一项具有挑战性的任务。在本文中，我们提出了受控高斯过程动力学模型（CGPDM），用于通过将其嵌入到低维流形中学习高维非线性动态。 CGPDM由一个低维潜在空间组成，具有相关的动态，外部控制变量可以作用于该空间，并映射到观测空间。考虑高斯过程（GP）先验分布来边缘化两个映射的参数。因此，CGPDM将高维状态空间投影到较小的维度潜在空间中。",
