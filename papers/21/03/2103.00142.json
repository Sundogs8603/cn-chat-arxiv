    "translated_abstract": "一个完整的 3D 对象描述需要用可解释的方式表征变形空间，从单个实例的关节构造到跨类别的形状变化。在这项工作中，我们改进了一种先前的 3D 形状几何分离生成模型，该模型将物体几何空间分解为刚性方向、非刚性姿态和固有形状。该模型可以通过经典谱几何和结构化潜在表示空间的概率分离的组合，从原始 3D 形状进行训练，无需对应关系、标签，甚至无需刚性对齐。我们的改进包括更复杂的旋转不变处理和使用流形变形网络来连接潜在和谱空间。潜在空间的几何结构赋予了对对象变形空间的可解释性描述。此外，它还可以使姿态转移和姿态感知注册等任务更加容易，同时可以更好地控制生成形状。",
