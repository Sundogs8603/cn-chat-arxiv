    "abstract": "I study a model of advisors with hidden motives: a seller discloses information about an object's value to a potential buyer, who doesn't know the object's value or how profitable the object's sale is to the seller (the seller's motives). I characterize optimal disclosure rules, used by the seller to steer sales from lower- to higher-profitability objects. I investigate the effects of a mandated transparency policy, which reveals the seller's motives to the buyer. I show that, by removing the seller's steering incentive, transparency can dissuade the seller from disclosing information about the object's value, and from acquiring that information in the first place. This result refines our understanding of effective regulation in advice markets, and links it to the commitment protocol in the advisor-advisee relation.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一种顾问隐藏动机的模型：卖家向潜在买家披露关于物品价值的信息，买家不知道物品的价值或者卖家销售该物品的盈利能力（卖家的动机）。本文确定了最优的披露规则，即卖家用来将销售从低盈利物品转向高盈利物品的规则。本文探讨了一个强制透明政策的影响，该政策揭示了卖家对买家的动机。结果表明，透明度可以消除卖家的操纵动机，但也可能导致卖家不披露物品价值的信息，并从一开始就不去获取这些信息。这一结果可以提高我们在顾问市场中实施的有效监管和承诺协议，以及顾问与顾问关系中的联系的理解。",
