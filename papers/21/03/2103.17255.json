    "abstract": "In this article, we assess the benefits of coordination and partnerships between governments and private insurers, and provide further evidence for microinsurance products as powerful and cost-effective tools for achieving poverty reduction. To explore these ideas, we model the capital of a household from a ruin-theoretic perspective to measure the impact of microinsurance on poverty dynamics and the governmental cost of social protection. We analyse the model under four frameworks: uninsured, insured (without subsidies), insured with subsidised constant premiums and insured with subsidised flexible premiums. Although insurance alone (without subsidies) may not be sufficient to reduce the likelihood of falling into the area of poverty for specific groups of households, since premium payments constrain their capital growth, our analysis suggests that subsidised schemes can provide maximum social benefits while reducing governmental costs.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文评估了政府与私人保险公司之间的协调和合作的好处，并提供了关于微型保险产品作为实现减贫的强大和具有成本效益的工具的进一步证据。为了探讨这些观点，我们从破产理论的角度对家庭的资本进行建模，以衡量微型保险对贫困动态和社会保护的政府成本的影响。我们在四个框架下分析了该模型：未投保、投保（无补贴）、投保（补贴的固定保费）和投保（补贴的灵活保费）。虽然仅仅保险（无补贴）可能不足以减少特定群体家庭陷入贫困的可能性，因为保费支付限制了他们的资本增长，但我们的分析表明，补贴计划可以提供最大的社会效益，同时降低政府成本。",
