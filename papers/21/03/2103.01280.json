    "abstract": "This paper studies the estimation and inference of treatment histories in panel data settings when treatments change dynamically over time.  We propose a method that allows for (i) treatments to be assigned dynamically over time based on high-dimensional covariates, past outcomes and treatments; (ii) outcomes and time-varying covariates to depend on treatment trajectories; (iii) heterogeneity of treatment effects.  Our approach recursively projects potential outcomes' expectations on past histories. It then controls the bias by balancing dynamically observable characteristics. We study the asymptotic and numerical properties of the estimator and illustrate the benefits of the procedure in an empirical application.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了面板数据中治疗历史的估计和推断问题，特别是在治疗在时间上动态变化的情况下。我们提出了一种方法，允许治疗根据高维协变量、过去的结果和治疗动态分配，同时考虑结果和时间变化的协变量与治疗轨迹的关系，以及治疗效应的异质性。我们的方法通过在过去历史上对潜在结果期望进行递归投影，然后通过平衡动态可观测特征来控制偏差。我们研究了估计量的渐近性质和数值特性，并在实证应用中展示了该方法的优势。",

The method recursively projects potential outcomes' expectations on past histories and controls bias by balancing dynamically observable characteristics. The approach considers the relationship between outcomes and time-varying covariates, as well as heterogeneity of treatment effects. Empirical results demonstrate the advantages of the method."
