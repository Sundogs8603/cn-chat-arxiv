    "translated_abstract": "随着货运交付需求和运费不断增加，智能控制车队以实现高效和节约成本的解决方案变得越来越重要。本文提出了DeepFreight，一种基于无模型深度强化学习的多段货运配送算法，包括卡车调度和包裹匹配两个紧密协作的组件。具体来说，利用称为QMIX的深度多智体强化学习框架来学习一种调度策略，通过该策略可以得到与交付请求相关的车队的多步联合车辆调度决策。然后执行高效的多次转移匹配算法将交付请求分配给卡车。此外，DeepFreight与混合整数线性规划优化器集成以进行进一步优化。评估结果表明，所提出的系统可扩展性强，可确保100％的交付成功率，同时保持较低的延迟和高效性。",
