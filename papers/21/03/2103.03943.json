    "translated_abstract": "在离散序列中进行新颖性检测是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为与生成正常数据的过程相比，偏差通常很小或故意隐藏。可以通过建模正常序列并测量新序列与模型预测的偏差来检测新颖性。然而，在许多应用中，数据是由几个不同的过程生成的，因此在所有数据上训练的模型往往过度泛化，新颖性仍然未被检测到。我们提出通过分解方法来应对这一挑战：通过对数据进行聚类，我们将问题进行分解，从而在每个聚类中获得更简单的建模任务，从而可以更准确地进行建模。然而，这会带来一个权衡，因为每个聚类的训练数据量减少了。这对于数据需求量较大的离散序列来说是一个特殊的问题。因此，这种方法的成功取决于聚类的质量，即个体学习问题是否足够",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a novel approach to detecting novelties in sequential data by clustering and decomposing the modeling tasks. The method achieves more accurate modeling by breaking down the problem into simpler tasks in each cluster, but faces the challenge of reduced training data per cluster, especially in the case of discrete sequences."
