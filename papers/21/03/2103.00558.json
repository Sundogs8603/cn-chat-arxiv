    "translated_abstract": "真实世界的数据集通常包含异常值，异常值的存在可以使聚类问题变得更具挑战性。在本文中，我们提出了一个简单的均匀抽样框架，用于解决具有异常值的三种代表性的基于中心的聚类问题：带有异常值的$k$中心/中位数/均值聚类。我们的分析与先前的（均匀和非均匀）抽样思想根本不同。为了理论上解释均匀抽样的有效性，我们引入了一个“显著性”度量，并证明我们的框架的性能取决于给定实例的显著性程度。特别地，如果我们假设给定实例是“显著”的话，样本大小可以独立于输入数据大小$n$和维度$d$，这在实践中是相当合理的假设。由于其简单性，与非均匀抽样方法相比，均匀抽样方法还具有几个显著的优势。",
