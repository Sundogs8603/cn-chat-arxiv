    "translated_abstract": "基于中心极限定理（CLT）的置信区间是经典统计学的基石。尽管只是渐近有效的，但它们普遍存在，因为它们允许在非常弱的假设下进行统计推断，并且通常可以应用于即使非渐近推断也不可能的问题。本文介绍了时间均匀的类似于这样的渐近置信区间。具体而言，我们的方法采用置信序列（CS）的形式 - 置信区间的序列，这些区间在时间上是统一有效的。CS可在任意停止时间进行有效推断，而不需要像经典置信区间那样在先固定样本大小的情况下产生“窥视”数据的惩罚。现有文献中的CS都是非渐近的，因此不能享受渐近置信区间的广泛适用性。我们的工作填补了这一空白，给出了“渐近CS”的定义，并推导出一个通用的渐近置信序列。",
