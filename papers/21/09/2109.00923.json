    "abstract": "Peer reviewed publications are considered the gold standard in certifying and disseminating ideas that a research community considers valuable.

In this work, we adopt a mechanism-design approach to propose improvements to the peer review process, tying together the paper submission and review processes and simultaneously incentivizing high-quality submissions and reviews. In the submission stage, authors participate in a VCG auction for review slots by submitting their papers along with a bid that represents their expected value for having their paper reviewed. For the reviewing stage, we propose a novel peer prediction mechanism (H-DIPP) building on recent work in the information elicitation literature, which incentivize",

    "translated_abstract": "同行评议的发表被认为是认证和传播研究界认为有价值的思想的黄金标准。然而，当前系统存在两个主要缺点：（1）由于提交数量庞大，对审稿人的需求压倒性，（2）缺乏激励机制促使审稿人参与并付出必要的努力提供高质量的审稿意见。在这项工作中，我们采用机制设计方法提出了改进同行评审流程的方案，将文献提交和审稿流程联系在一起，并同时激励高质量的提交和评审。在提交阶段，作者通过提交其论文和代表他们期望得到审稿意见的出价参加VCG拍卖，竞价争取审核名额。对于审稿阶段，我们提出了一种新颖的同伴预测机制（H-DIPP），建立在近期信息挖掘研究成果基础上，这种机制激励审稿人提出准确的审核意见。",
