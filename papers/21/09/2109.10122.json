    "translated_abstract": "本章介绍了一种特殊形式的有限依赖变量模型——离散选择模型，在这种模型中，因变量取离散值，其固有顺序性和连续潜变量表征。在这种场景下，因变量只能取两种离散值（如0和1），导致了二元模型（例如，probit模型和logit模型）或多于两种值（比如$j=1,2, \\ldots, J$，其中$J$是某个整数，通常很小），从而引起序数模型（例如，序数probit模型和序数logit模型）。在这些模型中，主要目标是对协变量条件下的响应/结果的概率建模。我们将离散选择模型的结果与经济学中的随机效用框架联系起来，讨论估计技术、介绍协变量效应的计算方法以及用于评估模型拟合程度的指标。还介绍了一些离散数据建模的最新进展。",
