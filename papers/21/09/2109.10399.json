    "translated_abstract": "天气的亚季节预测对资源配置和气候适应至关重要，但对预测社区提出了许多挑战。在这个预测时间范围内，基于物理的动力学模型的技能有限，并且预测目标以一种复杂的方式依赖于本地天气和全球气候变量。最近，机器学习方法显示出推进技术的潜力，但需要复杂的数据整理，将专家知识与多个相关数据来源、文件格式和时间空间分辨率的聚合进行整合。为了简化这个过程并加速未来的发展，我们介绍了SubseasonalClimateUSA，这是一个经过策划的数据集，用于训练和基准测试美国的亚季节预测模型。我们使用这个数据集来对各种不同的亚季节模型进行基准测试，包括操作性动力学模型、古典的气象基线以及十个统计模型。",
