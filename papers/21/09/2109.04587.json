    "abstract": "The dominant paradigm for semantic parsing in recent years is to formulate parsing as a sequence-to-sequence task, generating predictions with auto-regressive sequence decoders. In this work, we explore an alternative paradigm. We formulate semantic parsing as a dependency parsing task, applying graph-based decoding techniques developed for syntactic parsing. We compare various decoding techniques given the same pre-trained Transformer encoder on the TOP dataset, including settings where training data is limited or contains only partially-annotated examples. We find that our graph-based approach is competitive with sequence decoders on the standard setting, and offers significant improvements in data efficiency and settings where partially-annotated data is available.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，语义解析的主流范式是将解析作为序列到序列任务，使用自回归序列解码器生成预测值。本研究探讨了一种替代范式。我们将语义解析作为依赖解析任务进行了表述，应用了针对句法解析开发的基于图的解码技术。我们在 TOP 数据集上比较了给定相同预先训练的 Transformer 编码器的各种解码技术，包括训练数据有限或仅包含部分注释示例的设置。我们发现，我们基于图的方法在标准设置上与序列解码器相当竞争，并在数据效率和部分注释数据可用的设置中提供了显着的改进。",
