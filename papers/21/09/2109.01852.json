    "abstract": "The locations problem in infinite ethics concerns the relative moral status of different categories of potential bearers of value, the primary examples of which are people and points in time. The challenge is to determine which category of value bearers are of ultimate moral significance: the ultimate locations, for short. This paper defends the view that the ultimate locations are 'people at times'. A person at a time is not a specific person, but the person born at a specific point in time (de dicto). The main conclusion of the paper is that the unsettling implications of the time- and person-centered approaches to infinite ethics can be avoided. Most notably, a broad class of worlds that person-centered views deem incomparable can be strictly ranked.",

    "translated_abstract": "无穷伦理学中的位置问题涉及价值潜在承担者的不同类别之间相对道德地位的问题，其主要例子是人和时间点。挑战在于确定哪一类价值承担者具有终极道德意义：简而言之，是终极位置。本文辩护了“时间上的人”是终极位置的观点。在特定时间点的人不是特定的人，而是在特定时间点出生的人（de dicto）。本文的主要结论是，时间和以人为中心的无穷伦理观点的不安定意义可以避免。特别是，人为中心的观点认为不可比较的广泛类的世界可以严格排名。",
