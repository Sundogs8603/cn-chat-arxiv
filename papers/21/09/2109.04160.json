    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一种新颖的聚类任务，其中聚类可以具有组合关系，例如，一个聚类包含矩形图像，一个聚类包含圆形图像，一个（组合性）聚类包含同时拥有两种对象的图像。与层次聚类不同，其中父聚类表示子聚类属性的交集，我们的问题是找到表示组成聚类的属性并集的组合聚类。这个任务的动机来自于最近开发的少样本学习和嵌入模型，可以区分分配给示例的标签集，而不仅仅是单个标签。我们提出了三种新的算法--组合亲和传播（CAP）、组合k均值（CKM）和贪婪组合重新分配（GCR）--可以将示例分成连贯的群组并推断其中的组合结构。我们展示了有希望的结果，与流行的算法（如高斯m）",
