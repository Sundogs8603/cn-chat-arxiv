    "abstract": "We consider a class of stochastic control problems where the state process is a probability measure-valued process satisfying an additional martingale condition on its dynamics, called measure-valued martingales (MVMs). We establish the `classical' results of stochastic control for these problems: specifically, we prove that the value function for the problem can be characterised as the unique solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in the sense of viscosity solutions. In order to prove this result, we exploit structural properties of the MVM processes. Our results also include an appropriate version of It\\^o's lemma for controlled MVMs. We also show how problems of this type arise in a number of applications, including model-independent derivatives pricing, the optimal Skorokhod embedding problem, and two player games with asymmetric information.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一类具有额外鞅条件的概率测度值过程的随机控制问题，称为测度值鞅。我们建立了对于这些问题的“经典”随机控制结果：具体地说，我们证明了问题的值函数可以被表征为粘滞性解意义下的Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman方程的唯一解。为了证明这个结果，我们利用了测度值鞅过程的结构特性。我们的结果还包括了对于可控测度值鞅的适当版本的Itô引理。我们还展示了这类问题在许多应用中的出现，包括无模型衍生品定价、最优Skorokhod嵌入问题和具有非对称信息的两个玩家博弈。",
