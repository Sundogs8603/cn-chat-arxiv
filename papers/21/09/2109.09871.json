    "abstract": "We study how overreaction and underreaction to signals depend on their informativeness. While a large literature has studied belief updating in response to highly informative signals, people in important real-world settings are often faced with a steady stream of weak signals. We use a tightly controlled experiment and new empirical evidence from betting and financial markets to demonstrate that updating behavior differs meaningfully by signal strength: across domains, our consistent and robust finding is overreaction to weak signals and underreaction to strong signals. Both sets of results align well with a simple theory of cognitive imprecision about signal informativeness. Our framework and findings can help harmonize apparently contradictory results from the experimental and empirical literatures.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了关于信息量大小对信号更新的过度反应和欠反应的影响。尽管大量文献研究了高信息量信号的信念更新，但在现实世界中，人们往往面对一大堆弱信号。我们使用了严密的实验和新的来自博彩和金融市场的经验证据证明，信号强度对更新行为有着实质性的影响：在各领域中，我们得到了一致且稳健的结果，即对于弱信号存在过度反应，而对于强信号存在欠反应。这两种结果都与关于信号信息量的认知不精确的简单理论相吻合。我们的框架和发现可帮助协调实验和经验文献中表现出的明显矛盾之处。",
    "tldr": "研究表明，人们在面对弱信号时会存在过度反应，在面对强信号时会存在欠反应，这与信号信息量的认知不精确有关。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study shows that people tend to overreact to weak signals and underreact to strong signals, which is related to the imprecision of signal informativeness."
