    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了Hodge潜力选择（HPC），一种针对具有非自反优势关系的抽象博弈的新解决方案。该解决方案利用微分形式和Hodge分解等几何工具对抽象博弈进行了建模。我们提供了一个可行的算法，以及一种新的抽象博弈数据结构。从博弈的角度来看，HPC克服了传统解决方案的一些弱点。在完全情况下，HPC与Copeland选择一致，并且可以扩展到解决具有边际优势的博弈。我们证明了Hodge潜力选择具备中立性、强单调性、优势循环逆独立性和对互相优势的敏感性等三个普遍的公理特性。为了将HPC与Copeland选择在大样本的博弈中进行比较，我们设计了使用不同规模和完整性的随机生成的抽象博弈的数值实验。实验结果展示了HPC在统计方面的优势。",
