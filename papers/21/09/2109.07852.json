    "translated_abstract": "最近人工智能技术的发展使得其在商业和工业领域得以成功应用。然而，这些技术需要大量的数据进行集中式汇聚，从而阻碍了它们在数据敏感或数据传输成本高昂的情况下的应用。联邦学习通过去中心化模型训练解决了这些问题，从而消除了数据传输和汇聚的需求。为了推动联邦学习的应用，需要进行更多的研究和开发以解决一些重要的开放性问题。在本文中，我们提出了OpenFed，一个用于端到端联邦学习的开源软件框架。 OpenFed通过有针对性地消除现有的痛点，为研究人员和联邦学习使用者降低了准入门槛。对于研究人员，OpenFed提供了一个框架，使新方法的实现变得容易。",
