Here we revisit an elegant argument by the British physicist Dennis Sciama, which demonstrated that were our universe random, it would almost certainly have a negligible chance for life. Under plausible assumptions, we show that a random universe can masquerade as `intelligently designed,' with the fundamental constants instead appearing to be fined tuned to be achieve the highest probability for life to occur. For our universe, this mechanism may only require there to be around a dozen currently unknown fundamental constants. We speculate on broader applications for the mechanism we uncover.",

    "translated_abstract": "在高维空间中的随机抽样已成功应用于诸如核共振、神经网络和黑洞蒸发等各种现象。在此，我们重新审视了英国物理学家丹尼斯·Sciama的一个优雅论证，该论证表明，如果我们的宇宙是随机的，那么生命几乎不可能存在。在合理的假设下，我们展示了一个随机宇宙可以伪装成“智能设计”，基本常数似乎被精确调整以获得生命发生的最高概率。对于我们的宇宙，这种机制可能只需要大约一打目前未知的基本常数。我们推测我们所发现的机制可能具有更广泛的应用。",
