To this end, we introduce the so-called Property (RIE) for c\\`adl\\`ag paths, which is shown to imply the existence of a c\\`adl\\`ag rough path and of quadratic variation in the sense of F\\\"ollmer. We prove that the corresponding rough integrals exist as limits of left-point Riemann sums along a suitable sequence of partitions. This allows one to treat integrands of non-gradient type, and gives access to the powerful stability estimates of rough path theory. Additionally, we verify that (path-dependent) functionally generated trading strategies and Cover's universal portfolio are admissible integrands, and that Property (RIE) is satisfied by both (Young) semimartingales and typical price paths.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文应用粗路径理论为随机Ito积分提供了一种逐路径的基础，覆盖了大多数常用的交易策略和金融市场数学模型，包括骑士不确定性下的模型。为此，引入了所谓的c\\`adl\\`ag路径属性（RIE），表明存在一个“粗”的c\\`adl\\`ag路径以及F\\\"ollmer意义下的二次变差。证明了相应的粗略积分存在于沿着合适的分区序列的左端点黎曼和的极限中。这允许处理非梯度型的被积函数，并获得粗路径理论的强大稳定性估计。此外，验证了函数生成的交易策略和Cover的通用组合都是可靠的被积函数，而（Young）半鞅和典型价格路径都满足属性（RIE）。",
