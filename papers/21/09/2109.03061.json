    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the impact of information policies on the welfare of a population of individuals and finds that there are certain information policies that are superior to having no information policy, but restricting the data that can be used in these policies results in a decrease in welfare. Applications to privacy, recommender systems, and credit ratings are also discussed."
