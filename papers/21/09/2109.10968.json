    "abstract": "An individual can only experience regret if she learns about an unchosen alternative. In many situations, learning about an unchosen alternative is possible only if someone else chose it. We develop a model where the ex-post information available to each regret averse individual depends both on their own choice and on the choices of others, as others can reveal ex-post information about what might have been. This implies that what appears to be a series of isolated single-person decision problems is in fact a rich multi-player behavioural game, the regret game, where the psychological payoffs that depend on ex-post information are interconnected. For an open set of parameters, the regret game is a coordination game with multiple equilibria, despite the fact that all individuals possess a uniquely optimal choice in isolation. We experimentally test this prediction and find support for it.",

    "translated_abstract": "一个人只有在了解到未选择的替代方案时才会感到后悔。在许多情况下，了解未选择的替代方案只有在别人选择了它的情况下才可能实现。我们构建了一个模型，在这个模型中，每个后悔回避者个体的事后信息取决于他们自己的选择和他人的选择，因为他人可以揭示关于之前可能发生的情况的事后信息。这意味着看似一系列孤立的个人决策问题实际上是一个丰富的多人行为博弈，即后悔游戏，其中依赖于事后信息的心理回报相互关联。在一组参数的开放集中，后悔游戏是一个具有多个均衡的协调游戏，尽管所有个体在孤立情况下都拥有唯一的最优选择。我们对此进行了实验验证，并得到了支持。",
