    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can predict the performance of an industrial design quickly and accurately and be used to optimize its shape effectively. However, to fully explore the shape space, one must often consider shapes deviating significantly from the training set. For these, GNN predictions become unreliable, something that is often ignored. For optimization techniques relying on Gaussian Processes, Bayesian Optimization (BO) addresses this issue by exploiting their ability to assess their own accuracy. Unfortunately, this is harder to do when using neural networks because standard approaches to estimating their uncertainty can entail high computational loads and reduced model accuracy. Hence, we propose a novel uncertainty-based method tailored to shape optimization. It enables effective BO and increases the quality of the resulting shapes beyond that of state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）可以快速准确地预测工业设计的性能，并用于有效优化其形状。然而，为了充分探索形状空间，通常需要考虑与训练集明显偏离的形状。对于这些情况，GNN的预测变得不可靠，但这通常被忽视。针对依赖高斯过程的优化技术，贝叶斯优化（BO）通过利用其评估自身精度的能力来解决这个问题。然而，当使用神经网络时，估计其不确定性的标准方法往往会导致计算量大和模型准确性降低。因此，我们提出了一种针对形状优化的新颖基于不确定性的方法。它实现了有效的BO，并提高了结果形状的质量，超过了最先进的方法。",
