These heuristics, which only require the first and last-choice probabilities of the underlying discrete choice model, are broadly applicable, efficient, and come with worst-case performance guarantees. We propose a clairvoyant firm model to assess, in the limit, the potential benefits of personalized assortments. Our numerical study indicates that when the mean utilities of the products are heterogeneous among the consumer types, and the variance of the utilities is small, then firms can gain substantial benefits from personalized assortments.

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了离散选择模型中的赔率比，并利用它们来制定界限，以便开发适用于完全单调约束下的组合优化问题的启发式算法，并评估个性化组合的效益。这些启发式算法仅需要底层离散选择模型的第一和最后选择概率，具有广泛的适用性，高效率，并带有最坏情况性能保证。我们提出了一个有洞察力的公司模型，以在极限情况下评估个性化组合的潜在收益。我们的数值研究表明，当产品的平均效用在不同的消费者类型之间具有异质性时，而且效用的方差很小时，公司可以从个性化组合中获得可观的收益。我们通过理论发现支持这些观察结果和其他结果。对于常规的DCM模型，我们展示了一个有洞察力的公司可以获得多达$n$倍的预期收益。",
