    "translated_abstract": "神经语言建模在不同的下游自然语言处理（NLP）任务中取得了进步。其中一个领域是开放域对话建模，基于GPT-2的神经对话模型（例如DialoGPT）在单回合对话中表现出有希望的性能。然而，这种（神经）对话模型因为生成的回复虽然可能与前一个人的回应有相关性，但很快会使人失去兴趣并陷入琐碎的对话，因此受到了批评。造成这种性能的原因之一是在人机对话中缺乏明确的对话策略。人们在对话中使用各种对话策略，其中一个关键的社交策略是自我披露（SD），即向他人展示自己的信息。社会渗透理论（SPT）提出，两个人之间的交流会随着关系的进展从表面层次逐渐深入。",
