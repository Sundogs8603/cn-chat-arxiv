    "translated_abstract": "二分网络出现在多个领域，例如生物学、社会学、生理学和计算机科学中。过去的研究提出了随机共同块模型（ScBM）来检测二分图数据的社区结构，但是ScBM完全忽略边权并且无法解释加权二分网络的块结构。为了解决这个问题，我们通过放宽ScBM的分布约束，提出了一个名为Bipartite Distribution-Free的模型来建模加权二分网络，并考虑节点度数的变化来构建模型扩展。我们的模型不需要在邻接矩阵的生成元上指定特定的分布，而只需要在期望邻接矩阵上指定块结构。本文中，我们提出了具有理论保证的谱算法，来识别社区。通过模拟和实证例子来展示我们所提出的模型和算法。",
