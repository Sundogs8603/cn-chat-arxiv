    "translated_abstract": "交通需求管理的概念通过在城市中实现最佳平衡的交通模式份额来促进可持续出行的发展，而模式份额管理直接反映了每个交通子系统，包括停车场的TDM。在发展中国家，政策制定者主要关注供给侧措施，而需求侧措施在政策影响方面尚未得到解决。有大量的文献介绍了TDM策略的响应，但大多数研究单独考虑了出行方式和停车选择行为，而没有考虑它们之间的权衡。不这样做可能会导致偏见模型估计和政策应用的不当。本文试图通过将停车选择作为模式选择行为模型中的内生决策来填补这一空白。本研究将态度因素和建筑环境变量与停车和出行属性相结合，以开发综合的联合停车和出行模式选择模型。",
