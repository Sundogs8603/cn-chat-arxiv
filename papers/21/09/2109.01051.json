    "translated_abstract": "变分量子算法（VQAs）通常被视为近期获得量子优势的最佳希望。然而，最近的研究表明，噪声可以严重限制VQAs的可训性，例如通过指数级使成本景观平坦化并抑制成本梯度的幅度。误差缓解（EM）在降低噪声对近期设备的影响方面显示出潜力。因此，自然地会问误差缓解是否能提高VQAs的可训性。在这项工作中，我们首先展示了对于一类广泛的EM策略，无法解决指数级成本集中问题而不在其他地方投入指数级资源。这类策略包括零噪声外推、虚拟蒸馏、概率误差抵消和克利福德数据回归等特例。其次，我们对这些EM协议进行了分析和数值分析，并发现其中一些（例如，虚拟蒸馏）可以使",
