    "abstract": "Modern recommendation systems ought to benefit by probing for and learning from delayed feedback. Research has tended to focus on learning from a user's response to a single recommendation. Such work, which leverages methods of supervised and bandit learning, forgoes learning from the user's subsequent behavior. Where past work has aimed to learn from subsequent behavior, there has been a lack of effective methods for probing to elicit informative delayed feedback. Effective exploration through probing for delayed feedback becomes particularly challenging when rewards are sparse. To address this, we develop deep exploration methods for recommendation systems. In particular, we formulate recommendation as a sequential decision problem and demonstrate benefits of deep exploration over single-step exploration. Our experiments are carried out with high-fidelity industrial-grade simulators and establish large improvements over existing algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "现代推荐系统应从延迟反馈中探索和学习。过去的研究往往侧重于从用户对单个推荐的响应中学习。这些工作利用了监督学习和强化学习的方法，但放弃了学习用户之后的行为。在过去的工作中，虽然致力于从随后的行为中学习，但缺乏有效的方法来引导并获取有意义的延迟反馈。当奖励较少时，通过引导探索有意义的延迟反馈变得特别具有挑战性。为了解决这个问题，我们为推荐系统开发了深度探索方法。具体而言，我们将推荐系统形式化为一个序列决策问题，并证明了深度探索方法在单步探索方面的优势。我们的实验是在高保真度的工业级模拟器下进行的，并且证明了该算法相比现有算法有很大的提升。",
