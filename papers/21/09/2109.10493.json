    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度强化学习和可扩展的逼真仿真技术的进步已经使得在各种视觉任务中，包括导航方面的具体AI愈发成熟。然而，尽管在教导体验化智能体在静态环境中导航方面取得了令人印象深刻的进展，但在包含移动行人或可移动障碍物的更动态的环境中的进展较少。该研究旨在评估不同增强技术对在这些具有挑战性环境中提高智能体性能的效果。我们发现，在训练过程中向场景中添加多个动态障碍物可显著提高智能体在测试时的泛化能力，成功率远高于基准智能体。我们还发现，可以将该方法与图像增强技术相结合，进一步提高成功率。此外，我们还展示了该方法在从一种模拟器转移到另一种模拟器时比图像增强方法更具鲁棒性。最后，我们证明了这种方法可以有效地提高智能体在复杂环境中的导航能力。",
