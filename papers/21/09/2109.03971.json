    "abstract": "This paper focuses on a setting with observations having a cluster dependence structure and presents two main impossibility results. First, we show that when there is only one large cluster, i.e., the researcher does not have any knowledge on the dependence structure of the observations, it is not possible to consistently discriminate the mean. When within-cluster observations satisfy the uniform central limit theorem, we also show that a sufficient condition for consistent $\\sqrt{n}$-discrimination of the mean is that we have at least two large clusters. This result shows some limitations for inference when we lack information on the dependence structure of observations. Our second result provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the cluster structure that the long run variance is consistently estimable. Our result implies that when there is at least one large cluster, the long run variance is not consistently estimable.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文关注于观测值具有群体依赖结构的情况，并提出了两个主要的不可能性结果。首先，我们证明了当只有一个大聚类时，即研究人员没有观测值依赖结构的任何知识时，不能一致地区分平均值。当聚类内的观测值满足均匀中心极限定理时，我们还证明了一个进行 $\\sqrt{n}$-区分平均值的一致的充分条件是至少有两个大聚类。这个结果显示了当我们缺乏有关观测值依赖结构信息时进行推断的一些限制。我们的第二个结果为长期方差一致估计提供了必要和充分条件。我们的结果意味着，当至少有一个大聚类时，长期方差不能一致地估计。",
