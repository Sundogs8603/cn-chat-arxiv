    "translated_abstract": "预测船舶在未来特定时间点的位置是许多海事应用的基本方面。虽然自动识别系统（AIS）提供了丰富的信息来实现这一任务，但使用AIS数据来预测船舶轨迹仍然具有极大的挑战性，即使对于现代机器学习/深度学习技术也是如此，因为运动数据本质上具有复杂性和多样性。本文通过引入一种新颖的AIS数据离散化高维表示和一种新的损失函数来显式考虑异质性和多样性来解决这些挑战。所提出的模型——TrAISformer——是一个修改后的变压器网络，在所提出的丰富空间中提取AIS轨迹的长期相关性，以预测几个小时后船舶的位置。我们在公开可用的真实AIS数据上报告实验结果。TrAISformer明显优于现有的最新方法。",
