    "translated_abstract": "基于历史用户-项目交互的推荐系统对于基于web的服务至关重要。然而，用于训练推荐模型的观察数据存在严重的偏倚问题。实际上，数据集的项目频率分布呈高度偏斜的幂律分布。一小部分热门项目的交互几乎占据了整个训练数据。从这种偏倚数据训练的正常模型倾向于重复生成来自热门项目的推荐，进一步加剧了偏倚并影响了对潜在有趣项目的探索。在这项工作中，我们从项目聚类的多目标优化视角创新性地探索推荐去偏倚的核心主题。为了在训练过程中平衡对不同流行度的项目聚类的学习，我们提出了一种模型无关的框架，即Item Cluster-Wise Pareto-Efficient Recommendation（ICPE）。",
