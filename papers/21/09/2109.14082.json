Early warning systems can provide alerts when an unsafe situation is imminent (in the absence of corrective action). To reliably improve safety, these warning systems should have a provable false negative rate; i.e. of the situations that are unsafe, fewer than $\\epsilon$ will occur without an alert. In this work, we present a framework that combines a statistical inference technique known as conformal prediction with a simulator of robot/environment dynamics, in order to tune warning systems to provably achieve an $\\epsilon$ false negative rate using as few as $1/\\epsilon$ data points. We apply our framework to a driver warning system and a robotic grasping application, and empirically demonstrate guaranteed false negative rate while also observing low false detection (positive) rate.",

    "translated_abstract": "在高风险的机器人应用中部署机器学习模型时，能够检测不安全情况的能力是至关重要的。预警系统可以在不采取纠正措施的情况下提前提供警报，以预示可能出现的不安全情况。为了可靠地提高安全性，这些预警系统应该具有可证明的误报率，即在不安全的情况下，会出现警报的概率小于ϵ。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个框架，将统计推断技术（称为合规预测）与机器人/环境动力学模拟器结合起来，以调整预警系统，以尽可能少的数据点证明达到ϵ的误报率。我们将我们的框架应用于驾驶员预警系统和机器人抓取应用，并在实证中证明了保证的误报率，同时观察到较低的误报率（阳性）。",
