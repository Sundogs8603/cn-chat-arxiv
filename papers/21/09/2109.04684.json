    "translated_abstract": "异常检测在包括医疗和金融系统在内的各种实际应用中扮演着至关重要的角色。由于这些复杂系统中异常标签数量有限，无监督异常检测方法近年来引起了广泛关注。现有无监督方法面临的两个主要挑战是：（一）在过渡领域中区分正常和异常数据，其中正常和异常数据高度混合；（二）定义一种有效的度量来最大化在假设空间中正常和异常数据之间的差距，该空间是由表示学习器构建的。为此，本文提出了一种新颖的得分引导网络并采用得分引导正则化方法，以学习和扩大正常和异常数据之间的异常分数差异。通过这种得分引导策略，表示学习器可以在模型训练阶段逐渐学习到更具信息量的表示，特别是过渡样本。",
