    "abstract": "The objective of this work is to optimize the performance of a constant flow parallel mechanical displacement micropump, which has parallel pump chambers and incorporates passive check valves. The critical task is to minimize the pressure pulse caused by regurgitation, which negatively impacts the constant flow rate, during the reciprocating motion when the left and right pumps interchange their role of aspiration and transfusion. Previous works attempt to solve this issue via the mechanical design of passive check valves. In this work, the novel concept of overlap time is proposed, and the issue is solved from the aspect of control theory by implementing a RBF neural network trained by both unsupervised and supervised learning. The experimental results indicate that the pressure pulse is optimized in the range of 0.15 - 0.25 MPa, which is a significant improvement compared to the maximum pump working pressure of 40 MPa.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在优化具有并联泵腔和被动止回阀的恒流并联机械位移微型泵的性能。关键任务是在左右泵互换吸入和输送角色时的往复运动期间，将由反流引起的压力脉冲最小化，这对稳定的恒流率产生负面影响。以往的工作尝试通过被动止回阀的机械设计来解决这个问题。本文提出了重叠时间的新概念，并通过实施RBF神经网络来实现从控制理论角度解决这个问题，同时使用无监督学习和监督学习对其进行了训练。实验结果表明，压力脉冲在0.15-0.25 MPa的范围内得到了优化，相比于最大泵工作压力40 MPa，这是一个重大的改进。",
