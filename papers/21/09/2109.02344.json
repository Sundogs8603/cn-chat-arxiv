    "translated_abstract": "多视角表示学习从共享上下文的多个视角中捕捉综合信息。最近的研究直观地将对比学习（CL）应用于表示学习，被认为是一种成对方式，但仍然可扩展：在学习视角共享表示时，不会过滤特定于视角的噪声；虚假的负对，其中负项实际上与正项属于同一类，以及真实的负对被等同对待；均匀地测量术语之间的相似性可能干扰优化。重要的是，很少有研究针对广义自监督多视角学习的理论框架，尤其是针对超过两个视角的情况。为此，我们从信息理论的角度重新思考现有的多视角学习范式，然后提出了一种新颖的信息理论框架，用于广义多视角学习。在其指导下，我们构建了一种具有三层递进的多视角编码方法。",
