    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑生产车间中的室内定位系统，其中装有传感器的物体发送其当前位置。鉴于数据容量较大，对产生的原始数据进行分析具有挑战性，原因是受到噪声干扰的影响。问题包括精度问题和传感器由于物流过程的动态性（例如经过的叉车的振动）而产生的不期望的唤醒。我们提出了一个量身定制的统计过程来解决这些问题，并将可视分析与运动检测相结合。与普通的停留点算法不同，我们不仅区分停留与移动，还考虑了不期望的唤醒。这导致了一个更详细的解释方案，适用于在线（例如订单监控）和离线应用（例如问题区域的检测）。该方法不需要除原始室内定位系统输出之外的其他信息，并能进行临时分析。我们在一个包含真实场景的广泛案例研究中验证了我们的发现。",
