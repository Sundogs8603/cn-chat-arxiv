    "translated_abstract": "精确推断细粒度交通流量是一个新兴但至关重要的问题，它可以帮助极大地减少所需交通监测传感器的数量以节省成本。本文发现交通流量与道路网络具有很高的相关性，但之前的研究中完全忽略了这一点，或者仅将其视为外部因素。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的路网感知交通流量放大器（RATFM），它明确利用道路网络的先验知识，全面学习细粒度交通流的道路感知空间分布。具体而言，我们首先引入了一个多方向1D卷积层来提取道路网络的语义特征。随后，我们将道路网络特征和粗粒度流量特征结合在一起，规范化道路相关交通流的短距离空间分布建模。此外，我们将道路网络特征作为查询来捕获长距离路段交通流量的关联。",
