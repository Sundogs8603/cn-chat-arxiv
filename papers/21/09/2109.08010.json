    "abstract": "We introduce WildWood (WW), a new ensemble algorithm for supervised learning of Random Forest (RF) type. While standard RF algorithms use bootstrap out-of-bag samples to compute out-of-bag scores, WW uses these samples to produce improved predictions given by an aggregation of the predictions of all possible subtrees of each fully grown tree in the forest. This is achieved by aggregation with exponential weights computed over out-of-bag samples, that are computed exactly and very efficiently thanks to an algorithm called context tree weighting. This improvement, combined with a histogram strategy to accelerate split finding, makes WW fast and competitive compared with other well-established ensemble methods, such as standard RF and extreme gradient boosting algorithms.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了WildWood（WW）这种新的用于监督学习的集合算法，采用了Random Forest（RF）类型。标准的RF算法使用自助法样本来计算包外（out-of-bag）分数，WW使用这些样本产生改进的预测，给出每个完全生长的树的所有可能子树预测的聚合。这是通过使用在包外样本上计算的指数权重聚合实现的，这些样本由称为上下文树加权（context tree weighting）的算法精确且高效地计算出来。值得注意的是，与其他成熟的集合方法，如标准RF和极限梯度提升（extreme gradient boosting）算法相比，WildWoods快速且具有竞争力，其中包括采用加速分裂查找的直方图策略。",
