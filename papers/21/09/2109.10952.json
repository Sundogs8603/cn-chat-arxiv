The approach enforces a cross-linguistically consistent representation, building on recent advances in dependency representation and semantic parsing. Specifically, the approach involves two steps. First, we annotate the corpora using the Universal Dependencies (UD) scheme for syntactic annotation, which has been developed to apply consistently to a wide variety of domains and typologically diverse languages. Next, we further annotate these data by applying an automatic method for transducing sentential logical forms (LFs) from UD structures. The UD and LF representations have complementary strengths: UD structures are language-neutral and support consistent and reliable annotation by multiple annotators, whereas LFs are neutral as ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种构建儿童语音（CDS）语料库以及句子逻辑形式的方法，并利用该方法在英语和希伯来语中创建了两个这样的语料库。该方法强调跨语言一致的表示，借鉴了依赖关系表示和语义解析方面的最新进展。具体而言，该方法包括两个步骤。首先，我们使用通用依存关系（UD）方案对语料库进行句法注释，该方案已经被开发出来以便一致地适用于各种领域和类型多样的语言。接下来，我们通过应用一种自动方法从UD结构转换句子逻辑形式（LFs）来进一步注释这些数据。UD和LF表示具有互补的优势：UD结构是语言中立的，支持多个注释者进行一致和可靠的注释，而LFs是中立的。",
