    "translated_abstract": "DNA存储是一种新兴技术，可以将数字信息存档在DNA分子中。这种方法相对于磁性和光学存储方案具有主要优势，如出色的信息密度、增强的数据耐久性以及维持数据完整性所需的可忽略功耗。为了访问数据，我们使用了信息检索过程，其中一些主要瓶颈是可扩展性和准确性之间的自然权衡。在这里，我们展示了一种模块化和整体性方法，将基于深度神经网络（DNN）在模拟数据上训练、基于张量积（TP）的纠错码（ECC），以及一个安全裕度机制结合到一个统一的流水线中。我们使用两种不同的测序技术展示了我们的解决方案对3.1MB 信息的提升。我们的工作在速度上比当前领先解决方案提高了最高3200倍，准确性提高了40%。",
