    "translated_abstract": "鉴于其高计算和存储效率，深度哈希方法（包括深度量化和深度二进制哈希）已成为大规模图像检索的常见解决方案。然而，大多数现有的哈希方法对于细粒度检索无法产生令人满意的结果，因为它们通常采用最后一个CNN层的输出生成二进制码。由于更深的层倾向于将视觉线索（如纹理）总结为抽象的语义（如狗和猫），最后一个CNN层产生的特征在捕捉浅层中存在但具有辨别力的细微视觉细节方面效果较差。为了改善细粒度图像哈希，我们提出了金字塔混合池化量化（PHPQ）方法。具体地，我们提出了金字塔混合池化（PHP）模块，用于从多层次特征中捕获和保留细粒度的语义信息，强调不同子类别之间的细微区分。此外，我们还提出了一个可学习的量化模块来进一步提高哈希的表达能力。",
