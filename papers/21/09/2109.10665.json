    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统在不同实际应用场景下广泛应用，可以帮助我们找到有用的信息。特别是，基于强化学习的推荐系统由于交互式和自主学习的能力已成为近年来的新兴研究课题。实证结果表明，基于强化学习的推荐方法往往优于大多数监督学习方法。然而，在将RL应用于推荐系统中存在各种挑战。为了理解这些挑战及相关解决方案，研究RL推荐系统的研究者和从业者需要一个参考。因此，我们首先提供了深入的概述、比较和总结四种典型推荐场景下应用的RL方法，包括交互式推荐、对话式推荐、序列推荐和可解释的推荐。此外，我们还系统地分析了在推荐系统中应用RL所面临的挑战和相关解决方案，包括探索利用困境、可扩展性问题和可解释性问题。我们还讨论了未来的研究方向和潜在应用。",
