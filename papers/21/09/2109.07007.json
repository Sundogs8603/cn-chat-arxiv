    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一组代理人的观察信念与贝叶斯更新一致的条件。如果信念是从在每个时期代理人观察到的某些主观分布下应用贝叶斯规则得出的，那么这些信念就与贝叶斯主义一致。本文的主要发现是，只有在后验分布的均值在先验分布下是一致绝对连续的情况下，信念才与贝叶斯主义一致。此外，本文还表明，关于贝叶斯主义的经验内容的现有结果依赖于对允许的主观分布的其他限制，例如代理人对信号分布的正确信念要求。",

Additionally, it highlights the dependency of existing results on additional restrictions on subjective distributions in terms of correct beliefs about signal distributions."
