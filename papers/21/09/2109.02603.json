This setting is of particular interest in recent online experimentation. We propose using parametric models for the treatment effects, leading to semiparametric models for the outcome distributions. We derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for the treatment effects for this setting, and propose efficient estimators. In the leading case with constant quantile treatment effects one of the proposed efficient estimators has an interesting interpretation as a weighted average of quantile treatment effects, with the weights proportional to minus the second derivative of the log of the density of the potential outcomes.

    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一种新的半参数估计方法来估计治疗效果。我们关注的是结果分布可能是厚尾的、治疗效果可能很小、样本量很大且分配完全随机的情况。这种设置在最近的在线实验中特别引人关注。我们提出使用治疗效果的参数化模型，从而导致结果分布的半参数模型。我们推导了该设置下治疗效果的半参数效率边界，并提出了高效的估计方法。在常量分位数治疗效果的主导情况下，其中一种提出的高效估计器具有有趣的解释，可以看作是分位数治疗效果的加权平均，权重与潜在结果密度函数的对数的二阶导数成反比。我们的分析还建议将Huber模型和修剪平均数扩展到包括不对称性。",
