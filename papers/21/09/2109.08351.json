    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了回归断点设计（RDD）分析中可能存在高维协变量的情况。具体而言，我们提出了在协变量选择时进行估计和推断的RDD模型的方法，该方法在协变量数量不论如何都能稳定地进行。所提出的方法将使用核权重的局部方法与$\\ell_{1}$惩罚相结合，以处理高维协变量。我们提供了理论和数值结果，以说明所提出方法的有用性。从理论上讲，我们分别为点估计和推断方法提供了风险和覆盖率特性。在某些特殊情况下，所提出的估计器在满足额外的稀疏条件的代价下比传统的协变量调整估计器更有效。从数值上看，我们的模拟实验和实证例子表明了所提出方法对于协变量数量在偏差和方差方面的稳健性。",
