    "abstract": "In recent years, text summarization methods have attracted much attention again thanks to the researches on neural network models. Most of the current text summarization methods based on neural network models are supervised methods which need large-scale datasets. However, large-scale datasets are difficult to obtain in practical applications. In this paper, we model the task of extractive text summarization methods from the perspective of Information Theory, and then describe the unsupervised extractive methods with a uniform framework. To improve the feature distribution and to decrease the mutual information of summarization sentences, we propose a new sentence extraction strategy which can be applied to existing unsupervised extractive methods. Experiments are carried out on different datasets, and results show that our strategy is indeed effective and in line with expectations.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，由于神经网络模型的研究，文本摘要方法再次引起了广泛关注。当前大部分基于神经网络模型的文本摘要方法都是需要大规模数据集的监督方法。然而，在实际应用中，获取大规模数据集是困难的。本文从信息论的角度对抽取式文本摘要方法进行建模，并使用统一的框架描述了无监督抽取方法。为了改善特征分布并降低摘要句子之间的相互信息，我们提出了一种新的句子提取策略，可以应用于现有的无监督抽取方法。我们在不同的数据集上进行了实验，结果表明我们的策略确实有效并符合预期。",
