    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一个开源工具（EmTract），用于从面向金融环境的社交媒体文本中提取情绪。为此，我们标注了一万条来自金融社交媒体平台StockTwits的短消息，并将其与开源情绪数据结合使用。然后，我们使用预先调整好的NLP模型DistilBERT，通过包括4,861个标记（表情符号和表情符号）来增加其嵌入空间，然后首先在开源情感数据上对其进行拟合，然后将其转移至我们标注的金融社交媒体数据。我们的模型在人工和chatGPT注释数据上均优于竞争的开源最先进情感分类器，如Emotion English DistilRoBERTa-base。与基于字典的方法相比，我们的方法在金融研究中具有三个主要优点。首先，我们的模型针对金融社交媒体文本进行了量身定制；其次，它包含社交媒体数据的关键方面，如非标准短语、表情符号和表情符号；第三，它通过顺序学习进行操作。",
