    "translated_abstract": "去中心化金融（DeFi）是通过智能合约在各种区块链上构建和提供的金融产品和服务。在过去的一年中，DeFi已经成为了热门话题并获得了市场资本化。然而，它也与犯罪有关，特别是各种类型的证券违规行为。DeFi缺乏了解您的客户要求，这给试图减轻此领域潜在犯罪的政府带来了挑战。本研究旨在揭示这个问题是否适合机器学习方法，即是否可以根据代币的智能合约代码识别潜在从事证券违规活动的DeFi项目。我们在以太坊上适应了以前检测特定类型证券违规行为的工作，根据从DeFi项目的代币智能合约代码（特别是基于opcode的特征）提取的特征构建分类器。我们的最终模型是一个随机森林模型，对基线进行了80％的F-1得分。",
