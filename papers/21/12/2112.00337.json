    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在各种任务上取得了出色的性能，但存在一个关键问题：对于完全未知的样本预测过于自信。许多研究已经提出成功过滤这些未知样本的方法，但只考虑了狭窄而具体的任务，如误分类检测、开集识别或分布外检测。在本研究中，我们认为这些任务应被视为根本相同的问题，因为理想的模型应具备对所有这些任务的检测能力。因此，我们引入了未知检测任务，将之前的单个任务进行整合，以对深度神经网络在广泛未知样本上的检测能力进行严格评估。为此，我们构建了不同规模的统一基准数据集，并对现有流行方法的未知检测能力进行了比较。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一个统一评估标准，针对深度神经网络对未知样本的检测能力进行了全面考察。通过构建统一基准数据集，并比较现有方法的表现，发现Deep Ensemble方法具有较高的未知检测能力。"
