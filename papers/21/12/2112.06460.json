    "translated_abstract": "顺序推荐系统对识别用户的时间偏好至关重要。然而，从简化的用户交互序列中学习的任务是一个显著挑战。数据增强被确定为增强这些序列信息丰富性的有效策略。传统的增强技术，如项目随机化，可能破坏固有的时间动态。尽管最近在逆时间伪项目生成方面取得了进展，但在自然时间顺序上评估时，它们可能引入时间差异。为此，我们提出了一种复杂的方法，Bidirectional temporal data Augmentation with pre-training（BARec）。我们的方法利用双向时间增强和知识增强微调来合成真实的伪先前项目，从而保留用户偏好并捕捉更深层次的项目语义相关性。",
