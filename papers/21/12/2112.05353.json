    "translated_abstract": "本篇论文考虑了最近流行的基于机器学习预测与在线算法设计相结合的超越最坏情况算法分析模型。我们在这个模型中研究了有向图和无向图的在线Steiner树问题。在线设置下，Steiner树已知具有强劲的下界，并且任何算法的最坏情况保证都距离理想很远。本文考虑了预测在线终端节点的算法。这些预测可能是错误的，算法的性能取决于预测错误的终端节点数量。这些保证确保了算法在有良好预测的情况下打破在线下界，并且当预测错误率增加时，竞争比例会优雅地降低。然后我们观察到理论是预测实验结果的准确性。我们展示了在终端节点从分布中抽取的图上，新的在线算法即使具有适度的正确预测值，也具有强大的性能。",
