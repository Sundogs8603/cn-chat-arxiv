    "translated_abstract": "智能的标志是能够自主地学习新的灵活的认知行为，也就是说，适当的行为不仅取决于直接的刺激（如简单的反射性刺激-反应关联），而且还取决于必须足够获取、存储和处理的上下文信息。虽然许多元学习算法可以设计出自主学习新任务的智能体，但是认知任务给典型的“学习如何学习”问题添加了另一个学习和记忆的层面。在这里，我们通过计算神经科学框架中的一系列简单的认知任务进化了神经网络，这些神经网络带有可塑的连接和神经调节。结果得到的进化网络可以通过其自身的连接自动修改来获取新的、从未在进化过程中出现过的简单认知任务，通过其进化的神经组织和可塑性系统的自发运作，只基于刺激和奖励。我们的结果强调了学习认知任务的重要性。",
