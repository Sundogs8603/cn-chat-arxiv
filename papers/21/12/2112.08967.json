    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种端到端驾驶模型，该模型将多任务UNet（MTUNet）架构和控制算法整合在从前置摄像头到驾驶决策的数据流管道中。它提供了定量指标来评估端到端驾驶系统的整体、动态和实时性能，从而评估MTUNet的安全性和可解释性。该架构包括一个分割任务、一个回归任务和两个分类任务，分别用于车道分割、路径预测和车辆控制。我们提出了三个不同复杂度的架构变体，并在四个静态度量的不同任务上进行比较，然后通过两个附加的动态度量在实时仿真中确定最佳架构。我们的结果表明，所提出的监督学习模型在相同任务的弯曲道路上的性能与增强学习模型相当，而后者不是端到端的而是多任务的。",
