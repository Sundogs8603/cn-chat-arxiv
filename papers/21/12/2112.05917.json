    "translated_abstract": "文章理解是自然语言处理中的一个重要挑战，具有许多应用，例如文章生成或图像到文章的检索。以往的工作通常使用预训练语言模型对文章中的所有标记进行统一编码。然而，在许多应用中，如理解新闻报道，这些文章都基于现实世界的事件，可能引用了许多难以准确识别和预测的命名实体。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一个ENtity-aware article GeneratIoN and rEtrieval (ENGINE)框架，将命名实体明确地融入到语言模型中。ENGINE框架有两个主要组成部分：一个命名实体提取模块，用于从文章的元数据和嵌入图像中提取命名实体；一个实体感知机制，增强模型识别和预测实体名称的能力。我们在三个公共数据集GoodNews、VisualNews和WikiText上进行了实验。",
