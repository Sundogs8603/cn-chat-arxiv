    "translated_abstract": "深度学习框架已经广泛应用，简化了复杂模型的创建和与各种应用的集成，即使对非深度学习专家也是如此。然而，与任何其他程序一样，它们容易出现错误。本文涉及一种名为静默错误的错误子类：它们导致错误行为，但不会导致系统崩溃、挂起，也不会向用户显示错误消息。由于深度学习应用和框架的“黑盒”和随机性质（最终用户无法理解模型如何做出决策），这样的错误在深度学习应用和框架中更加危险。本文首次对Keras和TensorFlow中的静默错误进行了实证研究，以及它们对用户程序的影响。我们从TensorFlow的GitHub存储库中提取了与Keras相关的已关闭问题。在我们收集的1,168个问题中，有77个是影响用户程序的可重现的静默错误。我们根据对用户程序的影响以及发生错误的组件对这些错误进行了分类。",
