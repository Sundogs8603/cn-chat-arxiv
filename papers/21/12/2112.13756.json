    "translated_abstract": "临床信息系统已经成为半结构化和部分注释的电子健康记录数据的大型存储库，这些数据已经达到了一个关键的质量，使它们对于监督的数据驱动神经网络方法非常有趣。我们探索了使用国际疾病分类（ICD-10）对50个字符长的临床问题列表条目进行自动编码，并在前100个ICD-10三位码上评估了三种不同类型的网络架构。一个快速文本基线达到了0.83的宏平均F1分数，其次是一个字符级LSTM，其宏平均F1分数为0.84。表现最佳的方法使用了下游RoBERTa模型和自定义语言模型，得到了0.88的宏平均F1分数。神经网络激活分析以及对假阳性和假阴性的调查揭示了不一致的手动编码是一个主要的限制因素。",
