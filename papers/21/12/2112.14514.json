    "translated_abstract": "煤炭开采是日本战间期一个有影响力的经济活动。初期，煤矿不仅雇用男性，还雇用女性作为在矿井里工作的矿工。然而，劳动节约技术的创新和传统的开采方法的更新，促成了早期1930年代通过对女矿工劳动法规的修订而引起的制度性变革。这从根本上改变了煤矿的面貌，成为熟练男性是从事地下工作的主要矿工的地方。我研究了煤矿对区域增长的影响，并评估了劳动法规引发制度性变革对过程的影响。通过将矿山的位置信息与基于登记和人口普查的统计数据进行链接，我发现煤矿导致了人口显着增长。劳动法规没有使局面停滞不前，反而加速了当地人口的增长，因为它迫使女性矿工离开劳动力市场，从而大量增加了当地人口。",
