Here, we give a comprehensive overview of the algorithm's use in a machine-learning setting, focusing on the supervised regime. We discuss the theoretical background, show how to use it for supervised graph and node representation learning, discuss recent extensions, and outline the algorithm's connection to (permutation-)equivariant neural architectures. Moreover, we give an overview of current applications and future directions to stimulate further research.",
