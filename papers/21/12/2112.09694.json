    "abstract": "We propose a simple and efficient image classification architecture based on deep multiple instance learning, and apply it to the challenging task of caries detection in dental radiographs. Technically, our approach contributes in two ways: First, it outputs a heatmap of local patch classification probabilities despite being trained with weak image-level labels. Second, it is amenable to learning from segmentation labels to guide training. In contrast to existing methods, the human user can faithfully interpret predictions and interact with the model to decide which regions to attend to. Experiments are conducted on a large clinical dataset of $\\sim$38k bitewings ($\\sim$316k teeth), where we achieve competitive performance compared to various baselines. When guided by an external caries segmentation model, a significant improvement in classification and localization performance is observed.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于深度多实例学习的简单高效的图像分类架构，并将其应用于在牙科放射图中具有挑战性的龋齿检测任务。从技术上讲，我们的方法有两个贡献：首先，即使使用弱的图像级标签进行训练，它也能输出局部补丁分类概率的热图。其次，它适用于从分割标签中学习以指导训练。与现有方法相比，人类用户可以忠实地解释预测，并与模型交互以决定要关注的区域。在一个包含约38k个多位X光片（约316k个牙齿）的大型临床数据集上进行了实验，在与各种基线方法相比表现出了竞争性的性能。当由外部龋齿分割模型指导时，观察到分类和定位性能的显著改善。",
