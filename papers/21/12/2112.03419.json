    "abstract": "Many learning tasks require observing a sequence of images and making a decision. In a transportation problem of designing and planning for shipping boxes between nodes, we show how to treat the network of nodes and the flows between them as images. These images have useful structural information that can be statistically summarized. Using image compression techniques, we reduce an image down to a set of numbers that contain interpretable geographic information that we call geographic signatures. Using geographic signatures, we learn network structure that can be utilized to recommend future network connectivity. We develop a Bayesian reinforcement algorithm that takes advantage of statistically summarized network information as priors and user-decisions to reinforce an agent's probabilistic decision. Additionally, we show how reinforcement learning can be used with compression directly without interpretation in simple tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多学习任务需要观察一系列图像并做出决策。在设计和规划节点之间的货运箱的运输问题中，我们展示了如何将节点网络及其之间的流作为图像处理。这些图像具有有用的结构信息，可以进行统计摘要。利用图像压缩技术，将图像压缩成包含可解释地理信息的数字集合，我们将其称作地理签名。利用地理签名，我们学习网络结构，以推荐未来的网络连通性。我们开发了一种贝叶斯强化算法，利用统计摘要的网络信息作为先验知识和用户决策来强化代理的概率决策。此外，我们还展示了在简单任务中如何直接使用压缩进行强化学习，不需要解释。",
