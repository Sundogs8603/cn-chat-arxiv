    "translated_abstract": "在关系三元组抽取(RTE)任务中，识别没有训练实例的未见关系是一个具有挑战性的任务。已经尝试使用问答模型或关系描述来识别未见关系，但这些方法缺乏有关已见和未见关系之间联系的语义信息。本文提出了一种基于Prompt和语义知识增强的模型（ZS-SKA），用于在零样本情况下识别未见关系。我们提出了一种新的基于类比推理的单词级句子翻译规则，并使用该规则从具有已见关系的实例中生成具有未见关系的增强实例。我们设计了基于外部知识图谱的加权虚拟标签构建的提示信息，以整合从已见关系中学到的语义知识信息。我们构造了加权虚拟标签词，而不是在提示模板中使用实际的标签集。我们学习了RTE任务的表示形式，",
