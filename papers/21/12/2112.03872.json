    "translated_abstract": "本论文研究集中学校分配中因果效应的非参数化识别和估计。在许多集中分配设置中，学生既受到抽签驱动的变异，也受到回归不连续（RD）驱动的变异。我们刻画了被识别的原子治疗效应（aTEs）的完整集合，定义为在给定学生特征时，一对学校之间的条件平均治疗效应。原子治疗效应是治疗对比的基础，常见的估计方法会掩盖重要的异质性。特别地，许多原子治疗效应的聚合将在RD变异驱动下置零权重，并且这种聚合的估计器在渐进下将对RD驱动的原子治疗效应放置逐渐消失的权重。我们开发了一种用于经验评估RD变异驱动下的原子治疗效应权重的诊断工具。最后，我们提供了估计器和相应的渐进结果以进行推断。",
