    "abstract": "This paper examines the local linear regression (LLR) estimate of the conditional distribution function $F(y|x)$. We derive three uniform convergence results: the uniform bias expansion, the uniform convergence rate, and the uniform asymptotic linear representation. The uniformity in the above results is with respect to both $x$ and $y$ and therefore has not previously been addressed in the literature on local polynomial regression. Such uniform convergence results are especially useful when the conditional distribution estimator is the first stage of a semiparametric estimator. We demonstrate the usefulness of these uniform results with two examples: the stochastic equicontinuity condition in $y$, and the estimation of the integrated conditional distribution function.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了条件分布函数 $F(y|x)$ 的局部线性回归估计。我们推导了三个一致性收敛性结果：一致偏差展开、一致收敛速率和一致渐近线性表示。上述结果中的一致性是相对于 $x$ 和 $y$ 的，因此在局部多项式回归的文献中尚未涉及。这种一致性收敛性结果在条件分布估计是半参数估计的第一阶段时特别有用。我们通过两个例子展示了这些一致性结果的实用性：$y$ 的随机等连续性条件和积分条件分布函数的估计。",
