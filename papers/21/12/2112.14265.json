In every period, after observing the past actions of his neighbors, each agent receives a private signal, and chooses an action whose payoff depends only on the state. Since equilibrium actions depend on higher order beliefs, it is difficult to characterize behavior. Nevertheless, we show that regardless of the size and shape of the network, the utility function, and the patience of the agents, the speed of learning in any equilibrium is bounded from above by a constant that only depends on the private signal distribution.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了长期的、理性的代理商在社交网络中的学习方式。在每个时间段中，每个代理商在观察到邻居的过去行动之后，收到一个私人信号，并选择一种仅依赖于状态的行动。由于平衡行动依赖于更高层次的信念，因此很难表征行为。然而，我们表明，不论网络的大小和形状、效用函数和代理的耐心如何，任何平衡中的学习速度都有一个上界，在该上界之内限制只取决于私人信号分布。",
