In this paper, we propose a novel CTR model named MOEF for recommendations under frequent changes of occasions.

    "translated_abstract": "促销在电子商务中变得越来越重要和普遍，以吸引客户和促进销售，导致场合经常变化，从而驱动用户表现出不同的行为。在这种情况下，由于即将到来的场合分布的不确定性，大多数现有的点击率（CTR）模型无法在在线服务中良好地推广。本文提出了一种新颖的CTR模型，名为MOEF，用于在场合经常变化的情况下进行推荐。首先，我们设计了一个时间序列，其中包括从在线业务场景中生成的场合信号。由于场合信号在频域中更具有区别性，我们对时间窗口应用傅里叶变换，得到一系列频谱，然后通过场合演变层（OEL）进行处理。通过这种方式，可以学习高阶场合表示，以处理在线分布的不确定性。此外，我们采用多个专家来学习特征表示，表示为场合上下文编码（OCE）和模型感知注意力（MAA），以捕捉用户行为和项目特征的不同方面。在真实世界的电子商务数据集上进行的广泛实验证明，MOEF在离线评估和在线服务方面优于最先进的CTR模型。",
