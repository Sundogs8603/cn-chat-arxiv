    "translated_abstract": "现代深度神经网络在医学图像分割任务上取得了显著进展。然而，最近观察到，它们倾向于产生过度自信的估计结果，甚至在高不确定性情况下也是如此，导致模型校准不良、不可靠。在这项工作中，我们介绍了一种基于最大熵的错误预测（MEEP）训练策略，用于分割网络，它有选择地对自信度过高的预测进行惩罚，仅关注错误分类的像素。我们的方法对神经结构不加偏见，不增加模型复杂度，可与多个分割损失函数配对使用。我们在两个具有挑战性的分割任务中进行了基准测试：脑磁共振图像中的白质高信号病变和心脏磁共振图像中的心房分割。实验结果表明，将MEEP与标准分割损失相结合，不仅在模型校准方面，而且在分割准确性方面，相比于基线模型都会带来改进。",
