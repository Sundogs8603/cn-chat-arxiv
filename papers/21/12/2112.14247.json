    "abstract": "We study the problem of reducing the variance of Monte Carlo estimators through performing suitable changes of the sampling measure which are induced by feedforward neural networks. To this end, building on the concept of vector stochastic integration, we characterize the Cameron-Martin spaces of a large class of Gaussian measures which are induced by vector-valued continuous local martingales with deterministic covariation. We prove that feedforward neural networks enjoy, up to an isometry, the universal approximation property in these topological spaces. We then prove that sampling measures which are generated by feedforward neural networks can approximate the optimal sampling measure arbitrarily well. We conclude with a comprehensive numerical study pricing path-dependent European options for asset price models that incorporate factors such as changing business activity, knock-out barriers, dynamic correlations, and high-dimensional baskets.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了通过对采样测度进行适当改变来减少蒙特卡罗估计的方差的问题，这些采样测度是由前馈神经网络引发的。我们在向量随机积分的概念基础上，刻画了由带有确定性协方差的向量值连续局部鞅引发的一类高斯测度的Cameron-Martin空间。我们证明了前馈神经网络在这些拓扑空间中具有通用逼近性质，最终得出了结论：由前馈神经网络生成的采样测度可以任意接近最优采样测度。在此基础上，我们对一些包含业务活动变化、敲出壁垒、动态相关性和高维篮子等因素的资产价格模型进行了全面的数值研究，定价路径型欧式期权。",
