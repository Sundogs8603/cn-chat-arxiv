    "translated_abstract": "终身图学习解决了不断适应演化图的图神经网络模型的问题。我们在本文中解决了终身图学习的两个关键挑战：处理新的类别和应对不平衡的类别分布。这两个挑战的结合尤其相关，因为新出现的类别通常只占数据的一小部分，加剧了原本就偏斜的类别分布。我们做出了几项贡献：首先，我们展示了未标记数据的数量对结果没有影响，这是一个终身学习的关键前提。其次，我们尝试了不同的标签率，并展示了我们的方法可以用极少量的标注节点就能表现良好。第三，我们提出了gDOC方法，在不平衡类别分布的约束下检测新类别。关键的部分是考虑到了类别不平衡的加权二元交叉熵损失函数。第四，我们提出了gDOC+方法，将gDOC与主动学习策略相结合，更有效地利用有限的标注数据检测新类别。我们的实验表明，我们的方法在演化图的终身学习标准基准数据集上优于多个基线和最先进的方法。",
