    "translated_abstract": "预测药物相互作用（DDI）是使用药品信息和许多对已知标签的相互作用药品来预测药品对的副作用（不良反应）的问题。这个问题可以被表述为预测 DDI 图中每对节点的标签（即副作用），其中节点是药品，边缘是具有已知标签的相互作用药品。针对这个问题，现有方法是图神经网络（GNN），它利用图中的邻域信息来学习节点表示。然而，对于 DDI，由于副作用的性质，存在许多带有复杂关系的标签。通常的 GNN 经常将标签固定为独热向量，这不能反映标签之间的关系，并且在罕见标签的困难情况下可能无法获得最佳性能。在本文中，我们将 DDI 表示为一个超图，其中每个超边是一个三元组：两个药品节点和一个标签节点。我们提出了 CentSmoothie，一种超图神经网络，通过在超图上的平滑池化来融合标签之间的相关性。CentSmoothie 在两个大型 DDI 预测基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。",
