    "translated_abstract": "事件抽取在许多工业应用场景中扮演着重要角色，高质量的事件抽取方法需要大量手动注释数据以训练监督学习模型。然而，获取注释数据的成本非常高，特别是对于领域事件注释，需要相应领域的专家参与。因此，我们引入主动学习技术来降低事件注释的成本。但是现有的主动学习方法存在两个主要问题，使它们无法很好地用于事件抽取。首先，现有的基于样本池选择的策略在计算成本和样本有效性方面存在局限性。其次，现有的样本重要性评估缺乏对本地样本信息的利用。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的基于深度学习的主动学习方法。我们提出了基于批次的选择策略和一个记忆损失预测模型（MBLP），以有效地选择未标记的样本。在选择过程中，MBLP被用来预测标记数据的可能损失，并指导选择具有最高信息增益的样本。在两个基准数据集上的实验表明，我们提出的方法优于现有的主动学习方法，并以显著降低注释成本的方式实现了最先进的性能。",
