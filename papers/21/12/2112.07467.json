    "abstract": "As consensus across the various published AI ethics principles is approached, a gap remains between high-level principles and practical techniques that can be readily adopted to design and develop responsible AI systems. We examine the practices and experiences of researchers and engineers from Australia's national scientific research agency (CSIRO), who are involved in designing and developing AI systems for many application areas. Semi-structured interviews were used to examine how the practices of the participants relate to and align with a set of high-level AI ethics principles proposed by the Australian Government. The principles comprise: (1) privacy protection and security, (2) reliability and safety, (3) transparency and explainability, (4) fairness, (5) contestability, (6) accountability, (7) human-centred values, (8) human, social and environmental wellbeing. Discussions on the gained insights from the interviews include various tensions and trade-offs between the principles,",

    "translated_abstract": "随着各种已发布的AI伦理原则的共识逐渐形成，高层次的原则和可立即采用的实际技术之间存在巨大差距，而这些技术可用于设计和开发负责任的AI系统。我们研究了来自澳大利亚国家科学研究机构(CSIRO)的研究人员和工程师的实践和经验，他们参与设计和开发许多应用领域的AI系统。我们使用半结构化访谈来研究参与者的实践如何与澳大利亚政府提出的一组高层次AI伦理原则相联系和一致。这些原则包括：(1)隐私保护和安全、(2)可靠性和安全性、(3)透明度和可解释性、(4)公正性、(5)可争议性、(6)责任制、(7)以人为中心的价值观、(8)人类、社会和环境的福祉。通过对访谈所获得的洞见的讨论，包括原则之间的各种张力和权衡。",
