    "abstract": "News recommendation models often fall short in capturing users' preferences due to their static approach to user-news interactions. To address this limitation, we present a novel dynamic news recommender model that seamlessly integrates continuous time information to a hierarchical attention network that effectively represents news information at the sentence, element, and sequence levels. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic negative sampling method to optimize users' implicit feedback. To validate our model's effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于静态的用户新闻交互方式，新闻推荐模型往往难以准确捕捉用户的偏好。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的动态新闻推荐模型，它能够无缝地将连续时间信息整合到分层注意力网络中，有效地表示句子、元素和序列级别的新闻信息。此外，我们引入了一种动态负采样方法来优化用户的隐式反馈。为了验证我们模型的有效性，我们在三个实际数据集上进行了大量实验，结果证明了我们提出的方法的有效性。",
