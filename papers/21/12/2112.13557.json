The characterization applies to all logics with classical model-theoretic semantics and fills the gap in formalisms lacking a model-theoretic characterization. Building upon the work of Katsuno and Mendelzon, the paper extends the characterization to AGM-style revision in arbitrary Tarskian logics."
