    "translated_abstract": "本文引入了一种简单且可行的筛选估计方法，用于具有潜在因子的半参数条件因子模型。我们在不要求大 $T$ 的情况下建立了估计量的大-$N$渐近性质。我们还开发了一种简单的自助法来进行关于条件定价误差以及因子载荷函数形状的推断。这些结果使我们能够利用任意非线性特征函数来估计大量个体资产的条件因子结构，而不需要预先指定因子，同时允许我们区分特征在捕捉因子 beta 和 alpha（即不可分散风险和错定价）中的作用。我们将这些方法应用于美国个别股票收益的截面，并发现了大量非零定价误差的强有力证据，这些误差结合起来产生的套利组合具有超过3的夏普比率。我们还记录了明显的随时间下降的特征。",
