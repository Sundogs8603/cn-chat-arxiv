    "abstract": "We investigate the impact of order flow imbalance (OFI) on price movements in equity markets in a multi-asset setting. First, we propose a systematic approach for combining OFIs at the top levels of the limit order book into an integrated OFI variable which better explains price impact, compared to the best-level OFI. We show that once the information from multiple levels is integrated into OFI, multi-asset models with cross-impact do not provide additional explanatory power for contemporaneous impact compared to a sparse model without cross-impact terms. On the other hand, we show that lagged cross-asset OFIs do improve the forecasting of future returns. We also establish that this lagged cross-impact mainly manifests at short-term horizons and decays rapidly in time.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们在多资产背景下研究了订单流失不平衡(OFI)对股票市场价格波动的影响。首先，我们提出了一种系统的方法，将极限订单簿的顶层OFIs组合成一个综合性OFI变量，用于更好地解释价格影响，与最佳水平OFI相比。我们展示了一旦来自多个层次的信息被整合成OFI，具有交叉影响的多资产模型并不比不带交叉影响术语的稀疏模型提供更多的即时影响解释能力。另一方面，我们表明滞后的跨资产OFIs确实有助于预测未来的回报。我们还确定这种滞后的交叉影响主要在短期时间内表现出来，并在时间上迅速衰减。",
