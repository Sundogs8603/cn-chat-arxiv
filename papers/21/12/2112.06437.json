    "translated_abstract": "考古学在采样和比例表示上存在根本问题，建立定居模式的从地区到区域的视图通常需系统步行勘测。而卫星和航空影像的系统手动勘测，在跨地区尺度下可以呈现历史遗存现象的分布视图，但这种粗暴方法却往往耗时、耗力且对敏感度和特异度存在差异。自监督学习方法的发展提供了一种使用未标注卫星和历史空中影像定位考古遗存的可扩展学习方案。然而，考古遗存相对于景观整体而言极为微小，目前的对比监督学习方法在高度不平衡数据集上表现较差。因此，本文提出一种半监督对比学习框架，使用遥感数据改善对南美南部安第斯古城化的鉴定。该方法通过标注和未标注样本的结合，能够有效地学习高度不平衡的数据集。实验结果表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能水平，并可极大地缩短对偏远地区考古遗存鉴定的工时和费用。",

By combining labeled and unlabeled samples, our method effectively learns from imbalanced datasets and significantly reduces the labor and time costs of identifying archaeological features in remote regions."
