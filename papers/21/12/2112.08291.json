We show an application to additive normal tempered stable processes, a class of additive processes that calibrates ``exactly\" the implied volatility surface.Numerical results are relevant.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种非常快速的加性过程蒙特卡洛方案：计算时间与布朗运动的标准算法数量级相当。我们详细分析了数值误差来源，并提出了一种减小两个主要误差来源的技术。我们还将我们的结果与基准方法进行了比较：用高斯近似进行跳跃模拟。我们展示了一种应用于加性正态温和稳定过程的方法，这是一类校准“精确”的隐含波动率面的加性过程。数值结果是相关的。这种快速算法也是一种精确定价路径依赖离散监控期权的工具，误差为1个基点以下。",
