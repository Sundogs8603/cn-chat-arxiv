    "translated_abstract": "垂直联合学习（VFL）是一种有前景的预测分析范式，通过与多个数据提供方（即数据方）的合作，在分散和保护隐私的方式下，赋予一个组织（即任务方）提高其预测模型的能力。尽管对VFL的兴趣不断增长，但缺乏有效且安全的工具来评估数据方拥有的数据价值，制约了VFL在商业环境中的应用。为解决这个问题，我们提出了FedValue，一种针对VFL的保护隐私且针对任务的无模型数据价值评估方法，它由数据价值度量和联合计算方法组成。具体来说，我们首先引入一种新颖的数据价值度量，即MShapley-CMI。该度量评估数据方对预测分析任务的贡献，而无需执行机器学习模型，使其非常适合于VFL的实际应用。接下来，我们开发了一种创新的联合计算方法。",
