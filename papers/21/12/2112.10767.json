    "translated_abstract": "基于规则的细粒度IP地理定位方法在不遵循假设规则的计算机网络中很难概括。最近，深度学习方法，如多层感知器（MLP），被尝试用于增加概括能力。然而，MLP 不适合于处理类似于网络的图结构数据。MLP 把 IP 地址视为孤立的实例，忽略连接信息，限制了地理定位的准确性。本文研究如何使用一种新兴的图深度学习方法——图神经网络（GNN）来增加概括能力。首先，将 IP 地理定位重新构造为属性图节点回归问题。然后，提出了一种基于 GNN 的 IP 地理定位框架，称为 GNN-Geo。GNN-Geo 由预处理器、编码器、消息传递（MP）层和解码器组成。预处理器和编码器将测量数据转换为初始节点嵌入。MP 层通过对连接进行建模来细化初始节点嵌入，从而提高了准确性。",
