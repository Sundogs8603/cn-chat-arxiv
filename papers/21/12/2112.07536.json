    "translated_abstract": "查询聚焦摘要(QFS)需要在给定查询的情况下，使用相关文档集合生成摘要。然而，在现实场景中这些相关文档需要手动进行注释，因此不一定能即时获得。为了解决这一限制，我们将QFS任务作为一项知识密集型(KI)任务进行处理，不要求直接获取相关文档，而是假定这些文档存在于大规模知识语料库中，并需要首先进行检索。为了探索这个新的设定，我们通过改编现有的QFS数据集构建了一个新的数据集(KI-QFS)。在该数据集中，回答查询需要从知识语料库检索文档。我们构建了三种不同的知识语料库，并进一步提供相关性注释以进行检索评估。最后，我们使用最先进的QFS模型和增强的检索模型对数据集进行了基准测试。实验结果表明，与原始QFS相比，QFS模型在KI-QFS上表现显著较差。",
