    "translated_abstract": "在反合成规划中，使用简单的基础分子合成复杂分子的可能路径数量巨大，导致可能性呈指数级增长。即使是有经验的化学家也往往难以选择最有前途的转化路径。现有方法依赖于人工定义或机器训练的评分函数，这些函数的化学知识有限，或使用昂贵的估算方法来进行指导。本文提出了一种称为经验引导的蒙特卡罗树搜索算法（EG-MCTS）来解决这个问题。在搜索过程中，我们建立了一个经验引导网络，从合成经验中学习知识。在基准 USPTO 数据集上的实验证明，EG-MCTS 在效率和有效性方面都比现有的方法有显著改进。在与文献的比较实验中，我们计算机生成的路径大多与报道的路径匹配。设计用于真实药物化合物的路径展现了该算法的有效性。",
