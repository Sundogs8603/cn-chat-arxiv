    "abstract": "This paper addresses significant obstacles that arise from the widespread use of machine learning models in the insurance industry, with a specific focus on promoting fairness. The initial challenge lies in effectively leveraging unlabeled data in insurance while reducing the labeling effort and emphasizing data relevance through active learning techniques. The paper explores various active learning sampling methodologies and evaluates their impact on both synthetic and real insurance datasets. This analysis highlights the difficulty of achieving fair model inferences, as machine learning models may replicate biases and discrimination found in the underlying data. To tackle these interconnected challenges, the paper introduces an innovative fair active learning method. The proposed approach samples informative and fair instances, achieving a good balance between model predictive performance and fairness, as confirmed by numerical experiments on insurance datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对在保险行业广泛使用机器学习模型所面临的重大障碍，特别关注促进公平性。最初的挑战在于有效利用未标记的保险数据，通过主动学习技术降低标注的工作量，并强调数据相关性。本文探讨了各种主动学习抽样方法，并评估它们对合成和实际保险数据集的影响。该分析强调了实现公正模型推断的困难，因为机器学习模型可能会复制底层数据中存在的偏见和歧视。为了解决这些相互关联的挑战，本文介绍了一种创新的公平主动学习方法。所提出的方法采样信息量充足且公平的实例，在模型预测性能和公平性之间取得了良好的平衡，这一点在保险数据集上的数值实验中得到了证实。",
