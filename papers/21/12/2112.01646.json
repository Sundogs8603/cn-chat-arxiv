This includes certain tasks for procedural generation in computer games, music and art. The so-called `Quantum Blur' method represents the first step on this journey, providing a simple proof-of-principle example of how quantum software can be useful in these areas today. Here we analyse the `Quantum Blur' method and compare it to conventional blur effects. This investigation was guided by discussions with the most prominent user of the method, to determine which features were found most useful. In particular we determine how these features depend on the quantum phenomena of superposition and entanglement.",
