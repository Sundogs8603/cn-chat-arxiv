    "translated_abstract": "当代社会在知识共享方面面临一个重要挑战：从相关个体获得快速且具体的建议十分困难。这种情况突显了现有劳动市场的不足之处，我们将其称为常规市场(CM)，它无法支持\"闪电工作\"——简短的对话任务。本文将技术限制造成的高交易成本视为这种低效的主要原因，导致巨大的工作机会损失和人类智能的低效利用。为了解决这个问题，本研究引入了在线闪电市场(BM)的概念，这是一个创新的平台，个体可以通过持续几秒钟或几分钟的视频或音频对话即时提供有偿建议。本文探讨了闪电市场在革新就业创造、减轻贫困、解决人口老龄化问题、对抗人工智能导致的失业问题、以及通过\"终身工作\"最大化人类价值等方面的潜力。",
