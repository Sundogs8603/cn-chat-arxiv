    "translated_abstract": "深度图像先验(DIP)及其变体在计算机视觉中解决逆问题方面显示出了显著的潜力，无需额外的训练数据。实际的DIP模型通常存在过度参数化的问题。在拟合过程中，这些模型首先学习到大部分期望的视觉内容，然后逐渐捕捉到潜在的建模和观测噪声，即过拟合。因此，DIP的实用性往往关键取决于良好的早停策略，以捕捉过渡期。在这方面，大多数用于视觉任务的DIP工作只展示了模型的潜力，报告了与真实结果的最佳性能，但对于如何在没有真实结果的情况下操作性地获得接近最佳性能并没有给出线索。在本文中，我们致力于突破DIP的实用性障碍，并提出了一种高效的早停策略，该策略在多个视觉任务和DIP变体中持续地检测到接近最佳性能。",
