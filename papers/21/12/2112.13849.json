    "abstract": "This paper examines the long-term effects of prenatal, childhood, and teen exposure to electoral violence on health and human capital. Furthermore, it investigates whether these effects are passed down to future generations. We exploit the temporal and spatial variation of electoral violence in Kenya between 1992 and 2013 in conjunction with a nationally representative survey to identify people exposed to such violence. Using coarsened matching, we find that exposure to electoral violence between prenatal and the age of sixteen reduces adult height. Previous research has demonstrated that protracted, large-scale armed conflicts can pass down stunting effects to descendants. In line with these studies, we find that the low-scale but recurrent electoral violence in Kenya has affected the height-for-age of children whose parents were exposed to such violence during their growing years. Only boys exhibit this intergenerational effect, possibly due to their increased susceptibility to malnu",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了产前、童年和青少年暴露于选举暴力对健康和人力资本的长期影响，并探讨了这些影响是否会传递给未来的后代。我们利用1992年至2013年期间肯尼亚选举暴力的时间和空间变化以及全国代表性调查来确定暴力事件的暴露人群。通过粗略匹配，我们发现产前到16岁期间暴露于选举暴力会降低成年人的身高。先前的研究表明，长期的大规模武装冲突会将发育迟缓的影响传递给后代。与这些研究一致，我们发现肯尼亚低规模但频繁发生的选举暴力影响了那些在成长期间的父母暴露于此类暴力事件中的儿童身高。只有男孩表现出这种代际效应，可能是由于他们更容易受到营养不良的影响。",
