    "translated_abstract": "由于生成模型能够从复杂的数据分布中生成逼真的样本，因此在计算机视觉和自然语言处理领域中，基于图像的生成模型引起了广泛关注。为了利用基于图像的生成模型在时间序列领域的进展，我们提出了一种二维图像表示方法，即拓展的时间序列间隔回报图（Extended Intertemporal Return Plot，XIRP）。我们的方法以尺度不变和可逆的方式捕捉了时间序列的动态特性，降低了训练时间并提高了样本质量。我们使用带有梯度惩罚的Wasserstein生成对抗网络（WGAN-GP）对合成的XIRP进行了基准测试，与其他图像表示方法和模型进行了相似性和预测能力指标的比较。我们的创新性、经过验证的时间序列图像表示方法在预测能力方面始终显著优于最先进的基于RNN的生成模型。此外，我们引入了改进的随机反演方法使得重建时间序列的效果更好。",

The superiority of the method in terms of predictive ability is validated through comparisons with other image representations and models. Additionally, an improved stochastic inversion is introduced to enhance the reconstruction effect of time series."
