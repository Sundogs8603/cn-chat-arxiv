    "translated_abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL)在实践中相对于model-free RL实现了显著的样本效率，但其性能常常受限于模型预测误差的存在。为了减少模型误差，标准的MBRL方法训练一个精心设计的网络来拟合整个环境动力学，但这浪费了可以分别建模的多个子动力学的丰富信息，从而能更准确地构建世界模型。本文提出了环境动力学分解（ED2）的创新世界模型构建框架，其以一种分解的方式对环境进行建模。ED2包含两个关键组成部分：子动力学发现（SD2）和动力学分解预测（D2P）。SD2能够自动发现环境中的子动力学，然后D2P根据这些子动力学构建分解的世界模型。ED2可以与现有方法轻松结合使用。",
