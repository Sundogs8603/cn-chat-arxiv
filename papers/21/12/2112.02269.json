    "abstract": "Dealers make money by providing liquidity to clients but face flow uncertainty and thus price risk. They can efficiently skew their prices and wait for clients to mitigate risk (internalization), or trade with other dealers in the open market to hedge their position and reduce their inventory (externalization).

The internalization vs. externalization dilemma has been a topic of recent active discussion within the foreign exchange (FX) community. This paper offers an optimal control framework for market making tackling both pricing and hedging, thus answering a question well known to dealers: `to hedge, or not to hedge?'",
