    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑具有未知则和未知方差（对于所有组分都相同）的$k\\geq2$个高斯组分混合物，这些组分是良好分离的，即不同组分的统计重叠最多为$k^{-C}$，其中$C\\geq1$为足够大的常数。我们展示了只有在允许混合权为指数级小数时才会出现这种难度，并且对于多项式下界混合重量，准多项式时间内可以实现非平凡算法保证。具体而言，我们开发了一种基于平方和方法的算法，其运行时间准多项式，并且可靠地区分一个由$k\\geq2$个良好分离的高斯组分混合物和一个纯高斯分布。作为证书，该算法输出此区分的一个符号。",
    "tldr": "本文针对具有未知均值和未知协方差的$k\\geq2$的高斯组分混合物，提出了一种准多项式时间内可靠区分该混合物与纯高斯分布的算法，并且该算法仅需要在多项式下界混合重量的情况下运行。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a quasi-polynomial time algorithm to distinguish a mixture of $k\\geq2$ well-separated Gaussian components with unknown means and unknown covariance from a pure Gaussian distribution, with the requirement of polynomially lower bounded mixing weights. The algorithm is based on the sum-of-squares method and is only needed to run under the situation of polynomially lower bounded mixing weights."
