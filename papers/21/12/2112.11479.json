    "translated_abstract": "技术的最新进展导致社交媒体的使用量增加，也导致大量用户生成的数据，其中包括令人讨厌和冒犯的言论。社交媒体上使用的语言通常是英语和育地方语言的组合。在印度，印地语是主要使用的语言，并经常与英语切换，形成印地英语（Hinglish）语言。过去已经采用了不同的机器学习和深度学习技术来对混合时的印地英语仇恨言论进行分类。然而，这些技术使用的循环或卷积机制计算成本高，内存需求大。过去的技术还使用复杂的数据处理方法，使现有技术非常复杂且难以改变数据。提出了一种更简单的方法，不仅与这些复杂网络一样，并且在如HASOC（印欧语言的仇恨言论和冒犯内容识别）此类混合印地英语文本的数据集上超过了性能基准。所提出的方法名为AtteSTNet，它利用注意力机制和子词分割来识别混合语言中的仇恨言论。所提出的方法比以前的技术表现更好，更简单易于维护。",
