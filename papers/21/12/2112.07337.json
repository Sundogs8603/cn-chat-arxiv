    "translated_abstract": "近年来，关于表格和链接文本的问答（TextTableQA）已经取得了重要的研究成果，因为表格通常与相关的文本嵌入在文档中。HybridQA和OTT-QA是两个最知名的TextTableQA数据集，其中的问题最好通过同时从表格单元和链接文本段落中获取信息来回答。这两个数据集的共同挑战是，训练实例如问题和答案，其中黄金答案可能不仅匹配跨越表格行的多个表格单元，而且还包括表格行及其相关文本范围内的多个文本跨度。我们提出了MITQA，这是一个基于Transformer的TextTableQA系统，专门设计用于通过多实例损失目标和谨慎的课程设计来应对这两个方面的远程监督。我们的实验表明，所提出的MRMS-DS方法显著提高了MITQA在HybridQA和OTT-QA数据集上的性能，证明了我们的方法在处理TextTableQA挑战方面的有效性。",
