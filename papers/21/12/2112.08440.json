    "translated_abstract": "气候变化预测是一个泛化问题：我们使用物理模型在过去、现在和未来的气候中对最近的过去进行外推。目前的气候模型需要对小于模型网格大小的尺度上发生的过程进行表示，这些过程是模型预测不确定性的主要来源。最近的机器学习（ML）算法有望改善这种过程表示，但往往在未经训练的气候环境中外推效果不佳。为了充分发挥物理和统计方法的优势，我们提出了一个新框架——称为\"气候不变\"的机器学习——将气候过程的知识纳入ML算法中，并证明它可以在三个不同的大气模型中在广泛的气候和地理条件下保持高准确性。我们的结果表明，将物理知识明确纳入数据驱动的地球系统过程模型中可以提高它们的一致性、数据效率和泛化能力。",
