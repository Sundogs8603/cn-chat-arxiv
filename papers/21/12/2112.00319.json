    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习的一个核心组成部分是数据增强的裁剪方法，它选择一个图像的子区域作为自监督损失中的正样本视角。其基本假设是在给定图像的随机裁剪和缩放的区域中，关于感兴趣的对象有共同信息，且所学的表示能够捕捉到这些信息。这种假设在ImageNet等有很大、位于中央的对象的数据集中得到了基本满足，但在OpenImages或COCO等更贴近真实世界非筛选数据的数据集中，通常有多个小对象。在这项工作中，我们表明基于随机裁剪的自监督学习对这样的数据集效果很差。因此，我们提出将随机裁剪中的一个或两个替换为通过对象提议算法获得的裁剪。这鼓励模型同时学习对象感知能力和特征表达。",
