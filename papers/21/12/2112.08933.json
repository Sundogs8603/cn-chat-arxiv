It utilizes hierarchically-refined label attention networks to predict CV entities and employs multiple deep learning models in parallel for prediction. The use of a lightweight micro web framework and microservices enables the deployment of large deep learning model-based pipelines, achieving parsing of regular CVs in less than 700 milliseconds."
