    "translated_abstract": "顺序推荐方法在现实世界的推荐系统中发挥着重要作用。这些系统通过利用历史记录来捕捉用户偏好，然后进行推荐。对比学习（CL）是一种先进的技术，可以帮助我们获得有信息量的用户表示，但这些基于CL的模型需要精细的负采样策略、繁琐的数据增强方法和大量的超参数调整工作。在本文中，我们提出了另一种方法来生成更好的用户表示，并向用户推荐更有吸引力的物品。特别地，我们提出了一种在顺序推荐中使用的有效的一致性约束（C$^2$-Rec），其中只使用了两个额外的训练目标，而没有进行任何结构修改和数据增强策略。我们在三个基准数据集和一个真实工业数据集上进行了大量实验，证明了我们的方法的有效性。",
