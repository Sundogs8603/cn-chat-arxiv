Commonly, interactions are represented by edges in a network or a graph, which implicitly assumes that the interactions are pairwise and static.

While pairwise interactions have been studied in a dynamic network setting and multi-way interactions have been studied using hypergraphs in static networks, there exists no method, at present, that can predict multi-way interactions or hyperedges in dynamic settings.

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new dynamic representation learning method called Dynamic TGN to predict multi-way interactions or hyperedges. Unlike existing static graph representation learning methods, Dynamic TGN deals with the dynamicity in both time and space dimensions and achieves higher accuracy and interpretability according to experimental evaluations on synthetic and real-world data."
