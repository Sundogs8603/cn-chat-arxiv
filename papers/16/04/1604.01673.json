We survey properties of U1 and investigate its relationship to description logics designed to accommodate higher arity relations, with particular attention given to DLR_reg. We also define a description logic version of a variant of U1 and prove a range of new results concerning the expressivity of U1 and related logics.",

    "translated_abstract": "统一一维分片（U1）是一种形式化语言，以一种自然的方式将二元逻辑扩展到具有任意元数关系的上下文中。我们调查了U1的属性并研究了它与旨在容纳更高元数关系的描述逻辑的关系，特别关注DLR_reg。我们还定义了U1的一个变体的描述逻辑版本，并证明了有关U1及其相关逻辑的表达能力的一系列新结果。",
