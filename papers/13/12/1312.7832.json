    "abstract": "In classical logic, \"P implies Q\" is equivalent to \"not-P or Q\". It is well known that the equivalence is problematic. Actually, from \"P implies Q\", \"not-P or Q\" can be inferred (\"Implication-to-disjunction\" is valid), while from \"not-P or Q\", \"P implies Q\" cannot be inferred in general (\"Disjunction-to-implication\" is not generally valid), so the equivalence between them is invalid in general. This work aims to remove exactly the incorrect Disjunction-to-implication from classical logic (CL). The paper proposes a logical system (IRL) with the expected properties: (1) CL is simply obtained by adding Disjunction-to-implication to IRL, and (2) Disjunction-to-implication is independent of IRL (either Disjunction-to-implication or its negation cannot be derived in IRL) in the general case. In other words, IRL is just the system obtained by exactly removing Disjunction-to-implication from CL.",

    "translated_abstract": "在经典逻辑中，“P蕴涵Q”等价于“非P或Q”。众所周知，这种等价关系存在问题。实际上，从“P蕴涵Q”可以推出“非P或Q”（“蕴涵到析取”是正确的），而从“非P或Q”通常不能推出“P蕴涵Q”（“析取到蕴涵”通常是不成立的），所以它们之间的等价关系通常是无效的。本研究旨在从经典逻辑（CL）中去除不正确的“析取到蕴涵”。本文提出了一个具有所期望属性的逻辑系统（IRL）：(1) 通过将“析取到蕴涵”添加到IRL中可以简单地得到CL；(2) 在一般情况下，“析取到蕴涵”与IRL无关（无法在IRL中推导出“析取到蕴涵”或其否定）。换句话说，IRL就是通过从CL中准确地去除“析取到蕴涵”而得到的系统。",
