    "abstract": "A group of people wishes to use money to exchange goods efficiently over several time periods. However, there are disadvantages to using any of the goods as money, and in addition fiat money issued in the form of notes or coins will be valueless in the final time period, and hence in all earlier periods. Also, Walrasian market prices are determined only up to an arbitrary rescaling. Nevertheless we show that it is possible to devise a system which uses money to exchange goods and in which money has a determinate positive value. In this system, tokens are initially supplied to all traders by a central authority and recovered by a purchase tax. All trades must be made using tokens or promissory notes for tokens. This mechanism controls the flow rather than the stock of money: it introduces some trading frictions, some redistribution of wealth, and some distortion of prices, but these effects can all be made small.",

    "translated_abstract": "一群人希望在多个时间段内使用货币高效地进行货物交换。然而，使用任何货物作为货币都有缺点，而且以纸币或硬币形式发行的法定货币在最后一个时间段将变得毫无价值，因此在所有较早的时间段也将如此。此外，瓦尔拉斯市场价格仅由任意重新缩放确定。尽管如此，我们证明了可以设计一种系统，该系统使用货币来交换货物，货币具有确定的正值。在这个系统中，中央机构最初向所有交易商提供代币，并通过购买税来回收。所有交易必须使用代币或代币的支付承诺进行。这种机制控制的是货币的流动而不是存量：它引入了一些交易摩擦、一些财富再分配和一些价格扭曲，但这些影响都可以很小。",
