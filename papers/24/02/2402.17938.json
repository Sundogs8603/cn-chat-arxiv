To address the IP theft risks posed by malicious end-users, EmMark enables proprietors to authenticate ownership by querying the watermarked model weights and matching the inserted signatures. EmMark's novelty lies in its strategic watermark weight parameters selection, nsuring robustness and maintaining model quality. Extensive proof-of-concept evaluations of models from OPT and LLaMA-2 families demonstrate EmMark's fidelity, achieving 100% success in watermark extraction with model performance preservation.

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了EmMark，一种新颖的水印框架，用于保护部署在资源受限边缘设备上的嵌入式大型语言模型的知识产权（IP）。为了解决恶意最终用户带来的IP盗窃风险，EmMark使所有者能够通过查询带有水印的模型权重并匹配插入的签名来验证所有权。EmMark的创新在于其战略性水印权重参数选择，确保了鲁棒性并保持模型质量。OPT和LLaMA-2系列模型的大量概念验证评估展示了EmMark的准确性，实现了在保留模型性能的同时，水印提取成功率达到100%。EmMark还展示了其对抗水印去除和篡改攻击的韧性。",
    "tldr": "EmMark是一种新型水印框架，用于保护嵌入式大型语言模型的知识产权，在鲁棒性和模型质量维持之间实现平衡，成功应对了IP盗窃风险，具有100%的水印提取成功率，并抵御了水印删除和伪造攻击。",
    "en_tdlr": "EmMark is a novel watermarking framework designed for protecting the intellectual property of embedded large language models, striking a balance between robustness and model quality, successfully addressing IP theft risks, achieving 100% success rate in watermark extraction, and resisting watermark removal and forging attacks."
