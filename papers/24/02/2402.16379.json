However, careful evaluations by human reveal that the translations produced by LLMs still contain multiple errors. Importantly, feeding back such error information into the LLMs can lead to self-correction and result in improved translation performance. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a systematic LLM-based self-correcting translation framework, named TER, which stands for Translate, Estimate, and Refine, marking a significant step forward in this direction. Our findings demonstrate that 1) our self-correction framework successfully assists LLMs in improving their translation quality across a wide range of languages, whether it's from high-resource languages to low-resource ones or whether it's English-centric or centered around other languages; 2) TER exhibits superior systematicity and interpretability compared to previous methods; 3)",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在机器翻译（MT）领域取得了令人印象深刻的结果。然而，人工仔细评估发现，LLMs生成的翻译仍然包含多个错误。重要的是，将这种错误信息反馈到LLMs中可以实现自校正，并改善翻译性能。受到这些观点的启发，我们引入了一个名为TER的系统LLM自校正翻译框架，代表了在这一方向上的重要进展。我们的研究结果表明：1）我们的自校正框架成功地帮助LLMs提高了多种语言的翻译质量，不管是从高资源语言到低资源语言，还是以英语为中心还是围绕其他语言；2）TER相比先前的方法展示出更优越的系统性和可解释性；3）",
