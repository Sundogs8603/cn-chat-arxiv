    "translated_abstract": "利用电阻处理单元（Resistive Processing Unit, RPU）架构进行深度神经网络（DNN）的学习是一种能效高的做法，因为它利用了专用的神经形态硬件，并利用随机计算的权重更新进行内存计算。Charge Trap Flash（CTF）器件可以实现DNN中基于RPU的权重更新。然而，之前的研究表明，在CTF基于RPU的权重更新中，非理想程序时间（V_T）会受到影响。非理想程序时间受CTF的两个因素的影响：第一个是输入脉冲数量（N）或脉冲宽度（pw）的影响，第二个是用于随机计算权重更新的更新脉冲之间的间隔时间（t_gap）。因此，必须研究这种非理想程序时间对神经网络训练模拟的影响。本研究首先提出了一种脉冲列设计补偿技术，以减少CTF的非理想程序时间所引起的总误差。",
