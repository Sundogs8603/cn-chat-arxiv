Network games, unlike communication situations, treat direct and indirect links among players differently and distinguish their effects in both worth generation and allocation processes. The weighted Myerson value is an allocation rule for Network games that generalizes the Myerson value of Network games. Here, the players are assumed to have some weights measuring their capacity to form links with other players. Two characterization of the weighted Myerson value are provided. Finally, we propose a bidding mechanism to show that the weighted Myerson value is a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium under a non-cooperative framework.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了网络游戏中的加权Myerson值，扩展了类似概念用于通信情境。网络游戏与通信情境不同，将玩家之间的直接和间接连结区分对待，并在价值生成和分配过程中区分它们的影响。加权Myerson值是网络游戏的一个分配规则，它泛化了网络游戏的Myerson值。在这里，假设玩家具有一定权重，用来衡量他们与其他玩家形成连结的能力。我们提供了加权Myerson值的两种表征。最后，我们提出了一个出价机制，证明了在非合作框架下，加权Myerson值是一个次博弈完美纳什均衡。",
