Researchers are working to enhance the color detection techniques for the application of computer vision. They have implemented proposed several methods using different color detection approaches but still, there is a gap that can be filled. To address this issue, a color detection method, which is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is proposed. Firstly, image segmentation is performed using the edge detection segmentation technique to specify the object and then the segmented object is fed to the Convolutional Neural Network trained to detect the color of an object in different lighting conditions. It is experimentally verified that our method can substantially enhance the robustness of color detection in different lighting conditions, and our method performed better results than existing methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "光线在视觉中起着至关重要的作用，无论是人类还是机器的视觉，对于周围光照条件的感知都会影响颜色的识别。研究人员正致力于提高计算机视觉中的颜色检测技术。他们提出了多种不同的颜色检测方法，但仍存在一些可以填补的空白。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的颜色检测方法。首先，使用边缘检测分割技术进行图像分割，以确定对象，然后将分割的对象输入经过训练的卷积神经网络，以检测不同光照条件下对象的颜色。实验证明，我们的方法可以显著提高在不同光照条件下的颜色检测的鲁棒性，并且我们的方法比现有方法表现更好。",
