    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.08869v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The long-standing problem of spam and fraudulent messages in the comment sections of Instagram pages in the financial sector claims new victims every day. Instagram's current spam filter proves inadequate, and existing research approaches are primarily confined to theoretical concepts. Practical implementations with evaluated results are missing. To solve this problem, we propose ScamSpot, a comprehensive system that includes a browser extension, a fine-tuned BERT model and a REST API. This approach ensures public accessibility of our results for Instagram users using the Chrome browser. Furthermore, we conduct a data annotation study, shedding light on the reasons and causes of the problem and evaluate the system through user feedback and comparison with existing models. ScamSpot is an open-source project and is publicly available at https://scamspot.github.io/.",

    "translated_abstract": "Instagram金融页面评论区存在着垃圾信息和欺诈信息的长期问题，每天都有新受害者。Instagram当前的垃圾邮件过滤器效果不佳，现有的研究方法主要限于理论概念，缺乏实际实现和评估结果。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了ScamSpot，一个综合的系统，包括一个浏览器扩展程序，一个经过优化的BERT模型和一个REST API。这个方法确保使用Chrome浏览器的Instagram用户可以公开访问我们的结果。此外，我们进行了数据注释研究，揭示了问题的原因和原因，并通过用户反馈和与现有模型的比较来评估系统。ScamSpot是一个开源项目，可以在https://scamspot.github.io/上公开访问。",
