Here, we examine the question whether intergroup interactions around important events affect polarization between majority and minority groups in social networks. We compile data on the religious identity of nearly 700,000 Indian Twitter users engaging in COVID-19-related discourse during 2020. We introduce a new measure for an individual's group conformity based on contextualized embeddings of tweet text, which helps us assess polarization between religious groups. We then use a meta-learning framework to examine heterogeneous treatment effects of intergroup interactions on an individual's group conformity in the light of communal, political, and socio-economic events. We find that for political and social events, intergroup interactions reduce polarization. This decline is we",

    "translated_abstract": "虽然接触不同观点可能会减少极端化，但当讨论对抗性时，也可能产生反效应并加剧极端化。在这里，我们研究了围绕重要事件的团体间互动是否影响社交网络中多数群体和少数群体之间的极端化。我们收集了约 70 万名印度 Twitter 用户在 2020 年参与与 COVID-19 相关话题讨论时的宗教身份数据。我们引入了一个基于推文文本的情境嵌入的新量度，用于帮助我们评估宗教群体之间的极端化。然后，我们使用元学习框架来研究围绕共同、政治和社会经济事件的异质处理效果对个体群体符合性的影响。我们发现，在政治和社会事件方面，团体间互动会减少极端化。",
