Specifically, we introduce a speech-to-unit processing pipeline that captures two types of representations with different time resolutions. For the language model, we adopt a dual-channel architecture to incorporate both types of representation. We also present new training objectives, masked context reconstruction and masked context prediction, that push models to learn semantics effectively. Experiments on the sSIMI metric of Zero Resource Speech Benchmark 2021 and Fluent Speech Command dataset show our framework learns semantics better than models trained with only one type of representation.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个框架，使用两种类型的表示（分别是编码上下文和音素信息）从原始音频信号中学习语义。具体地，我们引入了一个语音到单元处理流程，以不同的时间分辨率捕捉两种类型的表示。对于语言模型，我们采用了双通道架构来整合这两种表示类型。我们还提出了新的训练目标，即掩码上下文重构和掩码上下文预测，可以有效地推动模型学习语义。在Zero Resource Speech Benchmark 2021和Fluent Speech Command数据集上的实验结果显示，与只使用一种类型表示进行训练的模型相比，我们的框架能够更好地学习语义。",
