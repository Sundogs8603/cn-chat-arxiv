    "translated_abstract": "人类视觉感知系统展示了在学习时没有明确监督的情况下以及理解物体的部分整体组成方面的卓越能力。受到这两个能力的启发，我们提出了一种新颖的方法——分层自适应无监督目标检测(HASSOD)，该方法学习在没有人类监督的情况下检测物体并理解其组成。HASSOD采用分层自适应聚类策略，根据自监督的视觉表示将区域分组为对象掩码，自适应确定每个图像中的对象数量。此外，HASSOD通过分析掩码之间的覆盖关系和构建树结构来识别对象的层次级别。这种额外的自监督学习任务可以提高检测性能并增强可解释性。最后，我们放弃了之前方法中使用的低效的多轮自我训练过程，而采取了一种自我训练的方法，该方法在时间和计算资源上更高效。",
