    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.16903v1 公告类型：新 基于操作符的神经网络架构，如DeepONets已成为物理系统代理建模的一种有希望的工具。一般来说，为了进行操作符代理建模，训练数据是通过使用有限元法等技术解决PDEs生成的。数据生成的计算密集型特性是部署这些代理模型到实际应用中的最大瓶颈之一。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种新的方法来减轻DeepONets训练数据生成所带来的计算负担。与现有文献不同，所提出的数据生成框架不使用任何偏微分方程积分策略，从而显著减少了用于DeepONet生成训练数据集的计算成本。在所提出的策略中，首先随机生成输出字段，满足边界条件。",
