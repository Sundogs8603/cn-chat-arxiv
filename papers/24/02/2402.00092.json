    "translated_abstract": "分集训练是少样本学习中主流的训练策略。然而，在少样本的场景下，这种策略往往劣于一些非分集训练策略，如邻域分量分析（NCA），这挑战了训练条件必须与测试条件匹配的原则。因此，自然而然地提出了一个问题：如何搜索无分集任务从而获得更好的少样本学习效果？在这项工作中，我们提出了一种超越分集训练的新型元训练框架。在这个框架中，分集任务不直接用于训练，而是用于评估从任务集中选择的一些无分集任务对元学习器的训练效果。选择标准是通过亲和性设计的，亲和性衡量了在使用选定任务训练后，执行目标任务时损失降低的程度。在实验中，训练任务集包含了一些有前景的类型，如对比学习和分类。",
