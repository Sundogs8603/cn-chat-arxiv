    "translated_abstract": "无监督数据表示和可视化利用拓扑工具是拓扑数据分析（TDA）和数据科学的一个积极且快速发展的领域。其中最突出的工作线是基于所谓的Mapper图，这是一个组合图，其拓扑结构（连通组件，分支，环）与数据本身的拓扑结构相对应。然而，尽管高度通用和适用，其使用到目前为止一直受到其许多参数的手动调节的阻碍-其中一个至关重要的是所谓的滤波器:它是一个连续函数，其在数据集上的变化是构建Mapper表示和评估其拓扑结构的存在和大小的主要成分。然而，尽管对于其他Mapper参数（即，分辨率，增益，聚类）已经研究了一些参数调整方法，但目前还没有针对调整滤波器本身的方法。",
    "tldr": "可微分映射器提出了一种新方法，用于优化数据表示的拓扑结构，解决了手动调节Mapper图中许多参数的问题，特别是调节关键的滤波器参数。",
