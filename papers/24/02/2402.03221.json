    "abstract": "The propagation of offensive content through social media channels has garnered attention of the research community. Multiple works have proposed various semantically related yet subtle distinct categories of offensive speech. In this work, we explore meta-earning approaches to leverage the diversity of offensive speech corpora to enhance their reliable and efficient detection. We propose a joint embedding architecture that incorporates the input's label and definition for classification via Prototypical Network. Our model achieves at least 75% of the maximal F1-score while using less than 10% of the available training data across 4 datasets. Our experimental findings also provide a case study of training strategies valuable to combat resource scarcity.",

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体渠道中攻击性内容的传播引起了研究界的关注。多项研究提出了各种在语义上相关但微妙不同的攻击性言论类别。在这项工作中，我们探索了元学习方法，利用攻击性言论语料库的多样性来增强其可靠和高效的检测。我们提出了一种联合嵌入架构，通过Prototypical Network结合输入的标签和定义进行分类。我们的模型在4个数据集上至少达到了最大F1-score的75%，同时只使用了不到可用训练数据的10%。我们的实验结果还提供了一个案例研究，说明了对抗资源稀缺的训练策略的价值。",
