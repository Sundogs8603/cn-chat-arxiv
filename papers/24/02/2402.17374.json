The study is motivated by structural discrete choice models that use the control function methodology to correct for endogeneity bias. In this scenario, the first stage estimates the control function using some frequentist parametric or nonparametric approach. The structural equation in the second stage, associated with certain complicated likelihood functions, can be more conveniently dealt with using a Bayesian approach. This paper studies the asymptotic properties of the quasi-posterior distributions obtained from the second stage.
