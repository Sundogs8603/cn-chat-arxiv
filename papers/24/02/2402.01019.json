    "translated_abstract": "互联网经济和社会正淹没在欺骗性攻击中。这些攻击以假新闻、网络钓鱼和虚假招聘等多种形式呈现，我们称之为“欺骗领域”。机器学习和自然语言处理的研究人员一直在尝试通过设计特定领域的检测器来改善这个危险情况。只有少数最近的研究考虑到了领域独立的欺骗行为。我们收集了这些不同的研究线索，并研究了领域独立的欺骗行为。首先，我们提供了对欺骗行为的新的计算定义，并将其分解成一个新的分类系统。然后，我们分析了关于语言线索的争论，并提供了系统回顾的指导方针。最后，我们研究了常见的语言特征，并为不同形式的欺骗之间的知识转移提供了证据。",

It also analyzes the debate on linguistic cues for deception and provides guidelines for systematic reviews. Furthermore, it investigates common linguistic features and offers evidence for knowledge transfer across different forms of deception."
