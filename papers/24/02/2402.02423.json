To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-RLHF, a comprehensive system implementation tailored for RLHF.

    "translated_abstract": "强化学习与人类反馈（RLHF）通过与人类偏好对齐，避免了昂贵的手动奖励设计，已经受到了广泛关注。考虑到不同环境中不同学习方法和多样化的人类反馈类型对RLHF的进步进行量化是具有挑战性的，因为缺乏标准化的注释平台和广泛使用的统一基准。为了填补这个空白，我们引入了Uni-RLHF，这是一个为RLHF量身定制的综合系统实现。它旨在提供一个完整的从真实人类反馈到实际问题发展的工作流。Uni-RLHF包含三个部分：1）通用的多反馈注释平台，2）大规模的众包反馈数据集，3）模块化的离线RLHF基准实现。Uni-RLHF开发了一个用户友好的注释界面，适用于各种反馈类型，并与主要的强化学习框架兼容。",
