    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的表格理解能力通过对表格的问答任务进行了广泛研究。通常，只有表格的一小部分与给定问题的答案相关。不相关的部分会产生噪声和干扰信息，导致LLMs的性能下降。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了CABINET（基于内容相关性的表格问答噪声降低方法）- 一个能够让LLMs专注于相关表格数据并抑制无关信息的框架。CABINET包括一个无监督的相关性评分器（URS），与问答LLM差异性训练，根据其与输入问题的相关性对表格内容进行加权处理后再输入问答LLM（QA LLM）。为了进一步辅助相关性评分器，CABINET利用一个弱监督模块生成一个解析语句，描述行和列的标准。",
