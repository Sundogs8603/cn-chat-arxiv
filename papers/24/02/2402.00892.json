    "translated_abstract": "大型模型的出现标志着机器学习的新时代，通过利用庞大的数据集来捕捉和合成复杂的模式，大幅超越较小模型的性能。尽管取得了这些进展，但在音频生成领域，尤其是高保真（HiFi）44.1kHz领域的扩展仍然有限，先前的努力没有延伸到高频域中的频谱不连续性和模糊问题，并且对于域外数据缺乏稳健性。这些限制限制了模型在包括音乐和歌唱生成在内的各种用例中的适用性。我们的工作引入了通过可扩展的生成对抗网络实现的增强音频生成（EVA-GAN），在频谱和高频重建以及域外数据性能的稳健性方面，较之先前最先进的方法取得了显着改进，实现了使用包含36,000个样本的广泛数据集生成HiFi音频。",
