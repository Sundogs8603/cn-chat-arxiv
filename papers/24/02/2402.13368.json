    "translated_abstract": "在训练数据中容易产生虚假相关性的模型通常会产生脆弱的预测并引入意外的偏见。解决这一挑战通常涉及依赖先验知识和群组注释的方法，以消除虚假相关性，而这些信息在许多应用程序中可能并不容易获得。在本文中，我们建立了无监督物体中心学习与减轻虚假相关性之间的一种新联系。我们的方法不是直接推断与标签具有不同相关性的子组，而是专注于发现概念：在输入样本之间共享的离散思想。借助现有的物体中心表示学习，我们引入了CoBalT：一种概念平衡技术，有效减轻虚假相关性，而无需人类对子组进行标记。在水鸟、CelebA和ImageNet-9基准数据集上针对子群体变化的评估表明了其优越性。",
