    "abstract": "The current graph neural network (GNN) systems have established a clear trend of not showing training accuracy results, and directly or indirectly relying on smaller datasets for evaluations majorly. Our in-depth analysis shows that it leads to a chain of pitfalls in the system design and evaluation process, questioning the practicality of many of the proposed system optimizations, and affecting conclusions and lessons learned. We analyze many single-GPU systems and show the fundamental impact of these pitfalls. We further develop hypotheses, recommendations, and evaluation methodologies, and provide future directions. Finally, a new reference system is developed to establish a new line of optimizations rooted in solving the system-design pitfalls efficiently and practically. The proposed design can productively be integrated into prior works, thereby truly advancing the state-of-the-art.",

    "translated_abstract": "当前的图神经网络（GNN）系统普遍不展示训练准确性结果，并直接或间接依赖于较小的数据集进行评估。我们的深入分析表明，这给系统设计和评估过程带来了一系列的陷阱，质疑了许多提议的系统优化的实用性，并影响了结论和经验教训。我们分析了许多单GPU系统，展示了这些陷阱的根本影响。我们进一步提出了假设、建议和评估方法，并提供未来的方向。最后，我们开发了一个新的参考系统，以实现高效实用地解决系统设计陷阱的一系列优化。该设计可以有效地融入之前的工作，真正推动技术的发展。",
