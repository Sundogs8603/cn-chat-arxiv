The key challenge of the rating elicitation is to choose the seed items which can best infer the new users' preference. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end Deep learning framework for Rating Elicitation (DRE), that chooses all the seed items at a time with consideration of the non-linear interactions. To this end, it first defines categorical distributions to sample seed items from the entire itemset, then it trains both the categorical distributions and a neural reconstruction network to infer users' preferences on the remaining items from CF information of the sampled seed items.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，推荐系统开始使用评分调查来改进初始推荐的质量，这种方法要求新用户对一个小的种子项目集进行评分以推断他们的偏好。评分调查的关键挑战在于选择能够最好推断新用户偏好的种子项目。本文提出了一种新颖的端到端深度学习框架用于评分调查（DRE），该框架一次选择所有种子项目，并考虑非线性交互作用。为此，首先定义了分类分布来从整个项目集中抽样种子项目，然后训练分类分布和一个神经重构网络，从抽样的种子项目的CF信息中推断用户对剩余项目的偏好。通过端到端训练，学习了分类分布以选择最具代表性的种子项目，同时反映了复杂的非线性交互。",
