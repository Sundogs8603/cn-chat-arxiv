    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）对于路径损耗预测提供了一种有前景的解决方案。然而，由于数据的有限可用性，其有效性可能会降低。为了减轻这些挑战，本文引入了一种新颖的模拟增强数据增强方法，用于机器学习路径损耗预测。我们的方法将从蜂窝覆盖模拟器生成的合成数据与独立收集的现实世界数据集相结合。这些数据集通过在不同环境（包括农场、丘陵地带和住宅区）开展广泛的测量活动来收集。这种全面的数据收集为模型训练提供了至关重要的真实值。我们还设计了一组信道特征，包括从LiDAR数据集中导出的地理属性。然后，我们使用这些特征来训练我们的预测模型，结合了高效且稳健的梯度提升机器学习算法CatBoost。在我们的研究中，模拟数据的集成显著改善了路径损耗预测的性能。",
