    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.19135v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: In today's digital age, characterized by rapid news consumption and increasing vulnerability to propaganda, fostering citizens' critical thinking is crucial for stable democracies. This paper introduces the design of ClarifAI, a novel automated propaganda detection tool designed to nudge readers towards more critical news consumption by activating the analytical mode of thinking, following Kahneman's dual-system theory of cognition. Using Large Language Models, ClarifAI detects propaganda in news articles and provides context-rich explanations, enhancing users' understanding and critical thinking. Our contribution is threefold: first, we propose the design of ClarifAI; second, in an online experiment, we demonstrate that this design effectively encourages news readers to engage in more critical reading; and third, we emphasize the value of explanations for fostering critical thinking. The study thus offers both a practical tool and use",

    "translated_abstract": "在当今数字化时代，快速的新闻消费和日益对宣传的脆弱性成为特点，培养公民的批判性思维对于稳定的民主至关重要。本文介绍了ClarifAI的设计，这是一款新颖的自动化宣传检测工具，旨在通过激活分析性思维模式，遵循康曼的认知双系统理论，推动读者更加批判性地消费新闻。利用大型语言模型，ClarifAI可以检测新闻文章中的宣传，并提供丰富的背景解释，增强用户的理解和批判性思维。我们的贡献有三个方面：首先，我们提出了ClarifAI的设计；其次，在一项在线实验中，我们证明这一设计有效地鼓励新闻读者更多地进行批判性阅读；第三，我们强调了解释对于培养批判性思维的价值。因此，本研究既提供了一个实用工具，又提供了实验结果支撑。",
