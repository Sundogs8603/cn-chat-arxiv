    "translated_abstract": "在人类认知中，绑定问题描述了大脑如何灵活地将各种信息整合成具有连贯性的对象表示的未解之谜。类似地，在机器学习中，人们追求通过无监督学习以学习以对象为中心的表示来实现强大的泛化和推理能力的模型。借鉴神经科学理论，旋转特征通过引入矢量特征来学习这种表示，矢量特征的大小包含对象特征，方向包含对象关联。在架构的每个层中都嵌入了“$\\chi$-binding”机制，已被证明至关重要，但了解有限。在本文中，我们提出一种替代的“余弦绑定”机制，该机制显式计算特征之间的对齐并相应地调整权重，并且我们证明它可以达到相同的性能。这使我们能够与自注意力和生物神经学产生直接联系。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the binding dynamics in rotating features and proposes a novel \"cosine binding\" mechanism as an alternative to the traditional \"$\\chi$-binding\" mechanism. By explicitly computing alignment and adjusting weights, this new mechanism achieves equivalent performance to the traditional one, and has connections to self-attention and biological neuroscience."
