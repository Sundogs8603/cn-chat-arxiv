The recent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) present a timely opportunity to achieve this goal. Therefore, we propose research at the intersection of LLMs and optimization to create a Decision Optimization CoPilot (DOCP) - an AI tool designed to assist any decision maker, interacting in natural language to grasp the business problem, subsequently formulating and solving the corresponding optimization model.
