Algorithmic resignation involves the deliberate and informed disengagement from AI assistance in certain scenarios, by embedding governance mechanisms directly into AI systems. Our proposal is not merely about disuse of AI but includes guiding when and how these systems should be used or avoided. We discuss the multifaceted benefits of algorithmic resignation, spanning economic efficiency, reputational gains, and legal compliance. Further, we outline the operationalization of resignation through various methods such as positive and negative nudges, stakeholder incentive alignment, and careful consideration of the level of AI engagement. Using techniques like barring access to AI outputs selectively or providing explicit disclaimers on system performance, algorithmic resignation not only mitigates risks associated ",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文讨论了算法辞职，这是一种管理组织内使用AI系统的战略方法。算法辞职涉及在某些情况下有意识和明智地脱离AI辅助，通过直接将治理机制嵌入到AI系统中。我们的提议不仅仅是关于不使用AI，还包括指导何时以及如何使用或避免这些系统。我们讨论了算法辞职的多方面利益，涵盖经济效率、声誉增益和法律合规性。此外，我们概述了通过积极和消极助推、利益相关者激励对齐以及审慎考虑AI参与程度等各种方法来实现辞职。通过诸如有选择地阻止访问AI输出或对系统性能明确声明免责等技术手段，算法辞职不仅能降低与之相关的风险。",
