    "translated_abstract": "众所周知，当感兴趣的协变量之间存在强相关性时，Lasso的统计性能会显著下降。特别是，与计算效率低下的备选方案如最佳子集选择相比，Lasso的预测误差会变得严重严重。由于在稀疏线性回归问题中存在一个被普遍猜测的计算统计权衡，通常不可能一般性地减小这一差距。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个自然的稀疏线性回归设置，其中协变量之间的强相关性来自未观察到的潜在变量。在这种设定下，我们分析了由强相关性引起的问题，并设计了一个令人惊讶地简单的修复方法。虽然标准化协变量的Lasso失败了，但有一种异质缩放的协变量，Lasso将突然获得对估计的强有力保证。此外，我们设计了一个简单而高效的程序",
