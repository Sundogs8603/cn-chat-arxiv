    "translated_abstract": "基础模型已成为人工智能生态系统的支柱。特别是，基础模型可用作通用特征提取器，用于构建各种下游分类器。然而，基础模型容易遭受后门攻击，而后门基础模型是人工智能生态系统的单点故障，例如，多个下游分类器同时继承后门漏洞。在本研究中，我们提出了Mudjacking，这是第一个修补基础模型以消除后门的方法。具体来说，一旦部署了带有后门的基础模型，并检测到嵌入误分类触发器的输入，Mudjacking会调整基础模型的参数以消除后门。我们将修补基础模型形式化为优化问题，并提出了一种基于梯度下降的方法来解决它。我们在视觉和语言基础模型上评估了Mudjacking，使用了十一个基准数据集。",
