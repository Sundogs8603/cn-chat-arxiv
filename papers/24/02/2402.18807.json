In this paper, we concentrate on evaluating the decision-making abilities of LLMs post role-playing thereby validating the efficacy of role-playing. Our goal is to provide metrics and guidance for enhancing the decision-making abilities of LLMs in role-playing tasks. Specifically, we first use LLMs to generate virtual role descriptions corresponding to the 16 personality types of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (abbreviated as MBTI) representing a segmentation of the population. Then we design specific quantitative operations to evaluate the decision-making abilities of LLMs post role-playing from four aspects: adaptability, exploration$\\&$ex",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）现在越来越多地用于角色扮演任务，特别是在模仿特定领域专家时，主要通过角色扮演提示。在实际场景中互动时，角色的决策能力显著地塑造其行为模式。本文集中评估LLMs在角色扮演后的决策能力，从而验证角色扮演的有效性。我们的目标是为增强LLMs在角色扮演任务中的决策能力提供指标和指导。具体来说，我们首先使用LLMs生成对应于迈尔斯-布里格斯类型指标（MBTI）的16种人格类型的虚拟角色描述，代表人口的细分。然后，我们设计了具体的定量操作，从适应性、探索性等四个方面评估LLMs在角色扮演后的决策能力。",
