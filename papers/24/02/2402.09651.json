In this work, we report on an empirical study that investigates CI build failures throughout product development at Atlassian. Our quantitative analysis found that the repository dimension is the key factor influencing CI build failures. In addition, our qualitative survey revealed that Atlassian developers perceive CI build failures as challenging issues in practice. Furthermore, we found that the CI build prediction can not only provide proactive insight into CI build failures but also facilitate the team's decision-making. Our study sheds light on the challenges and expectations involved in integrating CI build prediction tools into the Bitbucket environment, providing valuable insights for enhancing CI processes.",
