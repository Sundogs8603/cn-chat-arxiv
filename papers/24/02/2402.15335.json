    "translated_abstract": "当前高光谱异常检测（HAD）基准数据集存在分辨率低、背景简单、检测数据规模小等问题。这些因素也限制了众所周知的低秩表示（LRR）模型在背景和目标特征分离方面的鲁棒性以及对手动参数选择的依赖性能。基于此，我们建立了一组新的用于改善复杂场景下HAD算法鲁棒性的HAD基准数据集，简称AIR-HAD。因此，我们提出了一个广义和可解释的HAD网络，通过深度展开可学习字典的LRR模型来完成，命名为LRR-Net$^+$，能够更通用地光谱解耦背景结构和目标特性，并同时消除由重要干扰目标引入的偏差。此外，LRR-Net$^+$集成了交替方向法的解决过程",
