    "translated_abstract": "用户在线行为足迹可以使公司发现基于行为的用户细分，并向用户发送特定细分的信息。在发现细分之后，通过像Facebook和Google这样的首选媒体渠道向用户发送信息可能具有挑战性，因为只有部分行为细分中的用户在媒体上找到匹配，并且只有其中一小部分看到消息（曝光）。即使高质量的发现也会在传递失败时变得无用。许多复杂的算法用于发现行为细分，然而这些算法忽略了传递组件。问题变得复杂是因为（i）发现是在公司数据（例如用户点击）的行为数据空间中进行的，而传递则是基于媒体定义的静态数据空间（例如地理位置，年龄）进行的；（ii）公司在预算限制下运作。我们引入了一种基于随机优化的算法，用于在预算限制下优化传递发现行为用户细分。",
