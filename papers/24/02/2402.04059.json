    "translated_abstract": "普遍存在的缺失值导致多变量时间序列数据部分观测，破坏了时间序列的完整性，阻碍了有效的时间序列数据分析。最近，深度学习插补方法在提高损坏的时间序列数据质量方面取得了显著的成功，进而提高了下游任务的性能。本文对最近提出的深度学习插补方法进行了全面的调查。首先，我们提出了对这些方法进行分类的方法，并通过强调它们的优点和限制来进行了结构化的综述。我们还进行了实证实验，研究了不同方法，并比较了它们对下游任务的改进。最后，我们指出了多变量时间序列插补未来研究的开放问题。本文的所有代码和配置，包括定期维护的多变量时间序列插补论文列表，可以在以下位置找到。",
