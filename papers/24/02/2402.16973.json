We show that an imperfect instruction generation model can be complemented with an effective communication mechanism to become more successful at guiding humans. The communication mechanism we build comprises models that can detect potential hallucinations in instructions and suggest practical alternatives, and an intuitive interface to present that information to users. We show that this approach reduces the human navigation error by up to 29% with no additional cognitive burden. This result underscores the potential of integrating diverse communication channels into AI systems to compensate for their imperfections and enhance their utility for humans.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了利用不完美语言模型来在基于定位导航任务的背景下引导人类决策的挑战。我们展示了不完美的说明生成模型可以通过有效的通信机制来更成功地引导人类。我们构建的通信机制包括可以检测说明中潜在幻觉并建议实际替代方案的模型，以及一个直观的界面将该信息呈现给用户。我们展示了这种方法可以将人类导航错误降低高达29%，而不增加额外的认知负担。这一结果突显了将多样化的通信渠道整合到AI系统中来弥补其缺陷并增强其对人类的实用性的潜力。",
