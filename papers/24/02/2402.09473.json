    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.09473v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of generating a set of counterfactual explanations for a group of instances, with the one-for-many allocation rule, where one explanation is allocated to a subgroup of the instances. For the first time, we solve the problem of minimizing the number of explanations needed to explain all the instances, while considering sparsity by limiting the number of features allowed to be changed collectively in each explanation. A novel column generation framework is developed to efficiently search for the explanations. Our framework can be applied to any black-box classifier, like neural networks. Compared with a simple adaptation of a mixed-integer programming formulation from the literature, the column generation framework dominates in terms of scalability, computational performance and quality of the solutions.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们考虑了一个问题，即如何生成一组针对一组实例的反事实解释，采用一对多分配规则，其中一个解释被分配给一个实例子组。我们首次解决了在考虑稀疏性的情况下最小化解释所需数量的问题，通过限制每个解释中允许集体改变的特征数量。我们开发了一个新颖的列生成框架，用于高效搜索解释。我们的框架可以应用于任何黑盒分类器，如神经网络。与文献中的简单混合整数规划公式的简单适应相比，列生成框架在可扩展性、计算性能和解决方案的质量方面占优势。",
