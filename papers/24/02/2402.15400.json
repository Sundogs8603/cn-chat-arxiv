In the former, time is an explicit condition, in the latter it is implicit. State-of-the-art methods have limitations along three dimensions. First, with neural inference, time constraints are merely soft-matched, giving room to invalid or inexplicable answers. Second, questions with implicit time are poorly supported. Third, answers come from a single source: either a knowledge base (KB) or a text corpus. We propose a temporal QA system that addresses these shortcomings. First, it enforces temporal constraints for faithful answering with tangible evidence. Second, it properly handles implicit questions. Third, it operates over heterogeneous sources, covering KB, text and web tables in a unified manner.

    "translated_abstract": "时态问答涉及时间约束，例如“...在2019年”或“...在COVID之前”。在前者中，时间是一个明确的条件，在后者中，它是隐含的。现有技术方法在三个方面存在局限性。首先，使用神经推理时，时间约束仅被软匹配，容易导致无效或无法解释的答案。其次，对于涉及隐含时间的问题支持不足。第三，答案只来自单一来源：知识库（KB）或文本语料库。我们提出了一个时态问答系统来解决这些缺陷。首先，它通过具体证据强制执行时间约束以确保忠实回答。其次，它正确处理隐含问题。第三，它以统一方式覆盖知识库、文本和网络表格，跨异构来源进行操作。该方法分为三个阶段：（i）理解问题及其时间条件，（ii）从中检索证据",
