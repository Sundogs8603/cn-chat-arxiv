    "translated_abstract": "在应对气候变化的斗争中，人们越来越多地关注智能电网中的新能源效率策略。2018年，欧洲联盟（EU）在适当的立法框架下，将可再生能源社区（REC）定义为一个参与者共享自己生产的可再生能源的局部电网，旨在通过合理的激励措施降低电费成本。这一举措旨在加速本地可再生能源利用的普及，其成本可能无法承受。由于REC在技术上属于智能电网，因此上述策略可以应用，并且需要实际的能源管理系统（EMS）。因此，在这项工作中，我们综合了一个在线分层EMS（HEMS），以最小化REC成本，评估其相对于本地自消耗方法的优越性。我们认真遵循欧盟技术指示（源自意大利），旨在获得尽可能真实的结果。REC之间的功率流动",
