    "translated_abstract": "主题建模是许多应用程序中自动提取主题的重要任务，例如情感分析和推荐系统。该方法对于服务行业来说是至关重要的，可以用于监控客户讨论。传统方法如潜在狄利克雷分配（Latent Dirichlet Allocation，LDA）在主题发现方面表现出色，但由于数据稀疏性和无法对文档中的单词顺序建模，它们的结果并不一致。因此，本研究提出了在BERTopic架构中使用核主成分分析（Kernel Principal Component Analysis，KernelPCA）和K-means聚类的方法。我们使用尼日利亚银行客户的推文准备了一个新数据集，然后使用该数据集来比较主题建模方法。我们的研究结果显示，在BERTopic架构中使用KernelPCA和K-means可以生成连贯的主题，其中连贯性得分为0.8463。",
