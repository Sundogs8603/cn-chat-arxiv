    "translated_abstract": "查询复杂模型以获得准确信息（例如流量模型、数据库系统、大型机器学习模型）通常需要耗费大量计算资源和较长的响应时间。因此，如果可以用较少的查询强模型解决不准确结果的问题，那么使用能够快速给出不准确结果的较弱模型是有优势的。在计算一个拟阵的最大权重基础的基础问题中，这个问题是许多组合优化问题的一个已知泛化。算法可以使用一个干净的查询拟阵信息的预测模型。我们额外提供了一个快速但脏的预测模型来模拟一个未知的、可能不同的拟阵。我们设计和分析了实际算法，这些算法只使用很少数量的干净查询相对于脏预测模型的质量，同时保持对任意质量差的脏拟阵的强健性，并接近给定问题的经典算法的性能。值得注意的是，我们证明了在许多方面我们的算法是最佳的",
