    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.18043v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: A prominent media topic in the UK in the early 2020s is the energy crisis affecting the UK and most of Europe. It brings into a single public debate issues of energy dependency and sustainability, fair distribution of economic burdens and cost of living, as well as climate change, risk, and sustainability. In this paper, we investigate the public discourse around the energy crisis and cost of living to identify how these pivotal and contradictory issues are reconciled in this debate and to identify which social actors are involved and the role they play. We analyse a document corpus retrieved from UK newspapers from January 2014 to March 2023. We apply a variety of natural language processing and data visualisation techniques to identify key topics, novel trends, critical social actors, and the role they play in the debate, along with the sentiment associated with those actors and topics. We combine automated techniques with manual disco",

    "translated_abstract": "早在2020年代初期，英国和大部分欧洲受到能源危机的影响，这成为一个突出的媒体话题。它将能源依赖性和可持续发展、经济负担的公平分配以及生活成本、气候变化、风险和可持续性等问题汇集到一个公共辩论中。本文研究了围绕能源危机和生活成本的公共话语，以确定在这场辩论中如何调和这些关键且矛盾的问题，识别参与其中的社会行为者以及他们的角色。我们分析了从2014年1月至2023年3月检索的英国报纸文献语料库。我们应用了各种自然语言处理和数据可视化技术，以确定关键主题、新趋势、关键社会行为者及其在辩论中的角色，以及与这些行为者和主题相关的情绪。我们将自动化技术与手动技术相结合。",
