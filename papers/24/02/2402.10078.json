    "translated_abstract": "生物启发式的地址事件表示（AER）传感器因其低功耗、高稀疏性和高时间分辨率而受到广泛关注。尖峰神经网络（SNN）已成为AER数据处理的固有选择。然而，AER-SNN范式的集成尚未充分探索异步处理、神经形态兼容性和稀疏尖峰，这是资源受限应用的关键需求。为了填补这一差距，我们引入了一种受大脑启发的AER-SNN对象识别解决方案，其中包括一个与第一尖峰识别网络集成的数据编码器。受到视觉皮层中神经元功能的启发，我们设计的解决方案是异步的并且与神经形态硬件兼容。此外，我们采用了去噪和第一尖峰编码的原理，以实现最佳的尖峰信号传递，显著减少了能耗。",
