    "abstract": "As language model agents leveraging external tools rapidly evolve, significant progress has been made in question-answering(QA) methodologies utilizing supplementary documents and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. This advancement has improved the response quality of language models and alleviates the appearance of hallucination. However, these methods exhibit limited retrieval accuracy when faced with massive indistinguishable documents, presenting notable challenges in their practical application. In response to these emerging challenges, we present HiQA, an advanced framework for multi-document question-answering (MDQA) that integrates cascading metadata into content as well as a multi-route retrieval mechanism. We also release a benchmark called MasQA to evaluate and research in MDQA. Finally, HiQA demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance in multi-document environments.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着利用外部工具的语言模型代理迅速发展，使用补充文档和检索增强生成（RAG）方法的问答（QA）方法学取得了重要进展。这种进步提高了语言模型的回答质量，并减轻了幻觉的出现。然而，当面临大量无法区分的文档时，这些方法在检索准确性方面表现有限，给实际应用带来了显著挑战。针对这些新兴的挑战，我们提出了HiQA，这是一个先进的多文档问答（MDQA）框架，将级联的元数据整合到内容中，同时具备多路径检索机制。我们还发布了一个名为MasQA的基准来评估和研究MDQA。最后，HiQA在多文档环境中展示了最先进的性能。",
