We propose a new distributional universality theorem for coupling-based normalizing flows, which overcomes several limitations of prior work.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新颖的理论框架，用于理解基于耦合的标准化流（如RealNVP）的表达能力。尽管耦合流在科学应用中很普遍，但由于其受限的架构，对于耦合流的全面理解仍然困难。现有的定理在实际应用中存在限制，因为它们需要使用任意病态的神经网络。此外，我们还证明了这些结构本质上导致体积保持流，这是一个限制表达能力的基本约束。我们提出了一种新的基于分布的耦合标准化流普适性定理，克服了以前工作的几个限制。我们的结果支持耦合架构具有表达能力的普遍经验，并为选择耦合函数的表达能力提供了细致入微的观点，填补了实证结果和理论理解之间的差距。",
