    "translated_abstract": "在智能制造系统中，考虑到基于自动导引车辆（AGV）的生产灵活性，具有运输约束的灵活作业车间调度（FJSPT）是优化最大化生产力的解决方案的关键。最近，基于深度强化学习（DRL）的FJSPT方法在规模泛化方面遇到了挑战。这些方法在与其训练集不同规模的环境中表现不佳，导致低质量的解决方案。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种新颖的基于图的DRL方法，命名为异构图调度器（HGS）。我们的方法利用在操作、机器和车辆节点之间提取的局部关系知识进行调度，采用图结构的决策框架来降低编码复杂性并增强规模泛化能力。我们进行了基准数据集的性能评估，结果显示该方法在规模泛化上具有良好的表现。",
