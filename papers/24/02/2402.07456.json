To this end, we introduce OS-Copilot, a framework to build generalist agents capable of interfacing with comprehensive elements in an operating system (OS), including the web, code terminals, files, multimedia, and various third-party applications. We use OS-Copilot to create FRIDAY, a self-improving embodied agent for automating general computer tasks. On GAIA, a general AI assistants benchmark, FRIDAY outperforms previous methods by 35%, showcasing strong generalization to unseen applications via accumulated skills from previous tasks. We also present numerical and quantitative",

    "translated_abstract": "与计算机的自主交互一直是一个具有巨大潜力的长期挑战，最近大型语言模型（LLM）的普及显著加快了数字代理的构建进展。然而，大多数这些代理被设计用于与特定软件或网站等狭窄领域进行交互，这限制了它们在通用计算机任务中的适用性。为此，我们引入了OS-Copilot，一个构建通用代理的框架，能够与操作系统（OS）中的全面元素进行交互，包括网络、代码终端、文件、多媒体和各种第三方应用程序。我们使用OS-Copilot创建了FRIDAY，一个能够自我提升的具象化代理，用于自动化通用计算机任务。在GAIA，一个通用人工智能助手基准测试中，FRIDAY的性能超过了以前的方法35%，通过从先前任务中积累的技能，展示了对未见应用的强大概括能力。我们还提出了数字和定量的...",
