To tackle these problems, we propose a novel model editing method that leverages knowledge graphs for enhancing LLM editing, namely GLAME.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在推动自然语言处理（NLP）任务方面起着关键作用，然而它们的有效性受到不准确和过时知识的影响。模型编辑出现作为解决这些挑战的一种有前途的方法。然而，现有的编辑方法很难跟踪和合并与编辑相关的知识变化，这限制了后期编辑的LLMs在处理编辑知识时的泛化能力。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种利用知识图谱增强LLM编辑的新模型编辑方法，名为GLAME。具体来说，我们首先利用知识图谱增强模块，揭示由于编辑而发生变化的相关知识，获得LLMs内部表示。这种方法允许LLMs内的知识变化通过外部图结构反映出来。随后，我们设计了一个基于图的知识编辑模块来集成str",
