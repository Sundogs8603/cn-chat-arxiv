    "translated_abstract": "神经网络在各种应用中取得了成功，但也容易受到对抗性攻击的影响。为了展示网络分类器的安全性，引入了许多验证器来推理给定输入对给定扰动的局部鲁棒性。尽管成功，局部鲁棒性不能推广到未见过的输入。一些工作分析全局鲁棒性属性，然而，它们都无法提供网络分类器在不改变分类的情况下的精确保证。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种针对分类器的新全局鲁棒性属性，旨在找到最小的全局稳健边界，其自然地扩展了用于分类器的流行的局部鲁棒性属性。我们引入了VHAGaR，一个用于计算此边界的可随时使用的验证器。VHAGaR依赖于三个主要思想：将问题编码为混合整数规划，并通过识别由于每个局部更改而产生的依赖关系来修剪搜索空间。",
