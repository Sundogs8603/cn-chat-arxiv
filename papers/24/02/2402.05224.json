    "translated_abstract": "随着STEM教育对批判性思维能力的日益关注，科学写作在注重探究技能的课程中发挥着越来越重要的作用。最近发布的一份数据集是基于一套探究型物理课程的两组大学水平的实验报告，依赖于利用多个维度的分析评估标准，指定学科知识和优秀解释的一般组成部分。每个分析维度都以6分制进行评估，以提供详细反馈，帮助学生提高科学写作技巧。手动评估可能较慢，并且在大班中对所有学生进行一致性校准可能很困难。尽管在STEM学科的开放性问题的自动评估上已经有很多工作，但在实验报告等长篇写作中的工作要少得多。我们提出了一个端到端的神经架构，其中包括独立的验证器和评估模块，灵感来源于开放领域问题回答的方法。",
