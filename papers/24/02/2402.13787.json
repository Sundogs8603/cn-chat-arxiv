    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们研究了链接分析算法在阻止少数群体达到高排名位置的条件。我们发现，使用中心性度量标准的最常见链接算法，如PageRank和HITS，在网络中可能再现甚至放大对少数群体的偏见。然而，它们的行为有所不同：一方面，我们凭经验证明，PageRank在大部分排名位置上反映了度分布，并且可以平衡少数群体在排名靠前的节点中的代表性；另一方面，我们发现HITS通过新颖的理论分析在同构网络中放大了现有的偏见，支撑证据为实证结果。我们发现HITS中偏见放大的根本原因是网络中存在的同质性水平，通过一个具有两个社区的不断发展的网络模型进行建模。我们以合成和真实数据集阐明了我们的理论分析。",
