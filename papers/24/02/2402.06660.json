    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了具有肉身的人工通用智能(AGI)的概念，它与人类意识的关系，以及元宇宙在促进这种关系中的关键作用。本文利用融入认知、Michael Levin的计算边界\"Self\"、Donald D. Hoffman的感知界面理论以及Bernardo Kastrup的分析唯心主义等理论框架来构建实现具有肉身的AGI的论证。它认为我们所感知的外部现实是一种内在存在的交替状态的象征性表示，而AGI可以具有更大计算边界的更高意识。本文进一步讨论了AGI的发展阶段、实现具有肉身的AGI的要求、为AGI校准象征性界面的重要性，以及元宇宙、去中心化系统、开源区块链技术以及开源人工智能研究所扮演的关键角色。它还探讨了新的沟通机制和用于加强对元宇宙的理解的技术工具，以帮助实现具有肉身的AGI。",
