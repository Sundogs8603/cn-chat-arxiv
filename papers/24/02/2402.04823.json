    "translated_abstract": "深度生成模型(DGMs)已被证明是生成表格数据的强大工具，因为它们能够越来越多地捕捉到其特征的复杂分布。然而，要生成真实的合成数据，仅仅拥有对其分布的良好近似通常是不够的，还需要遵守编码了问题背景知识的约束。在本文中，我们解决了这个限制，并展示了如何将用于表格数据的DGMs转化为保持给定约束的约束深度生成模型(C-DGMs)。这是通过自动解析约束并将其转化为与DGM无缝集成的约束层(CL)实现的。我们进行了大量的实验分析，使用了多种DGMs和任务，结果显示标准DGMs经常违反约束，一些超过了95%的不合规情况，而相应的C-DGMs从未违反约束。",
