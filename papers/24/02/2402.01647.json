    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能在社会和全球经济中的日益重要作用，人工智能教育和素养已成为大学和K-12教育中必要的组成部分，以培养学生面对人工智能驱动的社会。然而，当前的人工智能课程尚未足够普及和引人入胜，无法满足来自不同教育目标和不同社会经济背景的学生和学校的需求。在这项工作中，我们开发了一个面向大学和高中学生的开源学习模块，允许学生从零开始构建自己的机器人伙伴。这个开放平台可以提供关于人工智能各个方面的实践经验和入门知识，包括机器人技术、机器学习、软件工程和机械工程等。由于社交辅助机器人伙伴的社交和个人性质，该模块还特别强调以人为本的人工智能，使学生能够更好地理解和开发。",
