    "translated_abstract": "信任在个体的决策过程中起着至关重要的作用。传统的信任预测模型依赖于配对相关性来推断用户之间的潜在关系。然而，在现实世界中，用户之间的互动通常是复杂的，不仅仅是配对关系。超图提供了一种灵活的方法来建模这些复杂的高阶关联关系，因为超图可以利用超边来连接两个以上的节点。然而，大多数基于超图的方法是通用的，不能很好地应用到信任预测任务中。在本文中，我们提出了一种用于信任预测的自适应超图网络（AHNTP）的新方法，通过使用高阶相关性来提高信任预测的准确性。AHNTP利用基于模式的PageRank来捕捉高阶社交影响信息。另外，它还从节点级和结构级属性构建超群，以融入复杂的相关信息。",
