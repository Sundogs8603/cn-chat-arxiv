    "translated_abstract": "AI模型的迅速增加突显了充分的文档化的重要性，因为这样可以使用户了解、信任并有效地利用这些模型在各种应用中。虽然开发者鼓励制作模型卡，但目前还不清楚这些卡包含多少信息或者包含哪些信息。在这项研究中，我们对Hugging Face平台上的32,111份AI模型文档进行了全面分析，该平台是分发和部署AI模型的领先平台。我们的调查揭示了普遍的模型卡文档化实践。大多数下载量较大的AI模型提供了模型卡，但这些卡的信息量不一致。我们发现，有关环境影响、限制和评估的部分填写率最低，而训练部分则是填写得最全面的部分。我们对每个部分的内容进行分析，以了解从业者的重点关注内容。有趣的是，有相当多的模型卡在相关部分存在较大的空白。",
