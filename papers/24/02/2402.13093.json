Existing work edits LLMs at the level of factual knowledge triplets.

In this paper, we propose a new task setting: event-level knowledge editing, which directly edits new events into LLMs and improves over conventional triplet-level editing on (1) Efficiency. A single event edit leads to updates in multiple entailed knowledge triplets. (2) Completeness. Beyond updating factual knowledge, event-level editing also requires considering the event influences and updating LLMs' knowledge about future trends.

    "translated_abstract": "知识编辑旨在更新大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识，以防止它们过时。现有研究在事实知识三元组的级别上编辑LLMs。然而，现实世界中的自然知识更新来自新事件的发生，而不是直接更改事实三元组。本文提出了一个新的任务设置：事件级知识编辑，直接将新事件编辑到LLMs中，并在效率和完整性上改进了传统的三元组级别编辑。(1)效率。单个事件编辑会导致多个推断知识三元组的更新。(2)完整性。除了更新事实知识外，事件级别的编辑还需要考虑事件影响，更新LLMs关于未来趋势的知识。我们构建了一个高质量的事件级别编辑基准ELKEN，包括1,515个事件编辑，6,449个关于事实知识的问题和10,150个关于未来发展趋势的问题。",
