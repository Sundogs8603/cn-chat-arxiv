    "translated_abstract": "实体链接（EL）是自然语言处理中一个重要且具有挑战性的任务，旨在将文档或句子中表示实体的一些文本与字典或知识库中相应的条目进行链接。现有的大部分方法都专注于创建复杂的上下文模型，以寻找周围单词的线索来帮助解决链接问题。尽管这些经过调整的语言模型往往有效，但它们可能难以处理，难以训练，并且在其他领域转移效果不佳。幸运的是，像GPT这样的大型语言模型（LLMs）为EL模型中固有问题提供了高度先进的解决方案，但对LLM进行简单的提示并不奏效。在本研究中，我们定义了ChatEL，这是一个三步框架，用于提示LLM返回准确结果。总体而言，ChatEL框架将10个数据集的平均F1性能提高了超过2％。",
