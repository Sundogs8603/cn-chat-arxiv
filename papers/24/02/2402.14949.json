    "translated_abstract": "最近，人们越来越感兴趣利用机器学习来精确分类电能质量事件（PQEs）。然而，大多数研究都是在假设理想情况下进行的，而现实中我们可能会遇到测量噪声、直流偏移以及电压信号幅度和频率的变化。本文在先前使用深度学习进行PQE分类工作的基础上，提出了一个利用启用注意力的Transformer作为工具来准确分类考虑上述因素的PQE的深度学习框架。所提出的框架可以直接在电压信号上操作，无需单独进行特征提取或计算阶段。我们的结果表明，所提出的框架优于最近提出的基于学习的技术。它可以在上述条件下精确分类PQEs，准确率在99.81%至91.43%之间变化。",
