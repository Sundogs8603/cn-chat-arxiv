    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了符号音乐生成的问题（例如生成钢琴卷谱），技术重点放在不可微分规则引导上。音乐规则通常以符号形式表达在音符特征上，如音符密度或和弦进行，许多规则是不可微分的，这在使用它们进行引导扩散时存在挑战。我们提出了一种新颖的引导方法，称为随机控制引导（SCG），它仅需要对规则函数进行前向评估，可以与预训练的扩散模型以即插即用的方式一起工作，从而首次实现了对不可微分规则的无训练引导。此外，我们引入了一种用于符号音乐生成的高时间分辨率潜在扩散架构，可以与SCG以即插即用的方式组合。与符号音乐生成中的标准强基线相比，该框架在音乐质量方面展示了明显的进展",
