    "translated_abstract": "有效的根因分析（RCA）对于迅速恢复服务、最小化损失以及确保复杂系统的顺利运行和管理至关重要。先前基于数据驱动的RCA方法，特别是采用因果发现技术的方法，主要关注构建依赖或因果图以追溯根因。然而，这些方法常常不够理想，因为它们仅依赖于单一模态的数据，导致了次优的解决方案。在这项工作中，我们提出了Mulan，一种统一的多模态因果结构学习方法，用于根因定位。我们利用一个针对日志定制的语言模型来促进日志表示学习，将日志序列转换为时间序列数据。为了探索不同模态之间的复杂关系，我们提出了一种基于对比学习的方法，在共享潜在空间中提取模态不变和模态特定的表示。此外，我们引入了一种新颖的关键绩效",
