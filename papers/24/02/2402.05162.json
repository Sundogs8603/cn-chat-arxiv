This study explores this brittleness of safety alignment by leveraging pruning and low-rank modifications. We develop methods to identify critical regions that are vital for safety guardrails, and that are disentangled from utility-relevant regions at both the neuron and rank levels. Surprisingly, the isolated regions we find are sparse, comprising about $3\\%$ at the parameter level and $2.5\\%$ at the rank level. Removing these regions compromises safety without significantly impacting utility, corroborating the inherent brittleness of the model's safety mechanisms. Moreover, we show that LLMs remain vulnerable to low-cost fine-tuning attacks even when modifications to the safety-critical regions are restricted. These findings underscore the urgent need for more robust safety strategies in LLMs.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在其安全机制方面表现出固有的易碎性，这可从它们易受越狱和即使是非恶意微调也易受影响来说明。本研究通过利用修剪和低秩修改探讨了安全对齐的易碎性。我们开发了方法，能够识别对于安全防护至关重要，且在神经元和秩级别上与效用相关的区域。令人惊讶的是，我们发现的孤立区域是稀疏的，约占参数级别的$3\\%$和排名级别的$2.5\\%$。去除这些区域会损害安全性，而对效用的影响不大，从而证实了该模型安全机制的固有易碎性。此外，我们还表明，即使限制对安全关键区域进行修改，LLMs仍然容易受到低成本的微调攻击。这些发现强调了在LLMs中更强大的安全策略的紧迫性需求。",
