    "translated_abstract": "在在计算机视觉和自然语言处理中表现出色后，基础模型最近扩展到了机器人学领域。这些模型可以通过两种方式获得：开源或付费的闭源选项。用户同时有两种选择时，他们会面临一个问题，即在有效但昂贵的闭源模型和免费但功能较弱的开源模型之间做出决策。我们称之为模型选择问题。由于从闭源模型中收集大量训练数据的成本较高，现有的监督学习方法是不实际的。因此，我们将重点放在在线学习设置上，其中算法在收集数据的同时学习，消除了需要大量预先收集的数据集的需求。因此，我们提出了一个以用户为中心的在线模型选择问题，并提出了一种新颖的解决方案，该解决方案将开源编码器与处理该上下文的在线学习算法相结合。编码器将大量的数据分布提炼成低维特征，即上下文。",
