    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLM)在文本生成任务中展示了出色的能力。然而，利用这些模型存在固有的风险，包括但不限于抄袭、传播假新闻以及教育习题中的问题。尽管已有几种检测器被提出来解决这些问题，但它们在对抗扰动方面的效果，特别是在学生论文写作的背景下，仍然被较少探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过构建AIG-ASAP，一个基于AI生成的学生论文数据集，采用一系列预计能生成高质量论文的文本扰动方法，同时躲避检测。通过实证实验，我们评估了当前AIGC检测器在AIG-ASAP数据集上的性能。结果表明，现有的检测器可以很容易地被直接的自动对抗攻击所规避。具体来说，我们探索了词替换和句子替换方法。",
