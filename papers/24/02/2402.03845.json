    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型是生成模型，最近在高维度的采样质量和密度估计方面表现出令人印象深刻的性能。它们依赖于一个正向连续扩散过程和一个反向连续去噪过程，可以用一个时变向量场来描述，并用作一个生成模型。在扩散模型的原始定义中，该向量场被假设为分数函数（即在扩散过程中某一特定时间的概率对数的梯度）。有趣的是，在实际应用中，大多数关于扩散模型的研究将这个向量场实现为神经网络函数，并且不限制其为某种能量函数的梯度（也就是说，大多数研究并不约束向量场是保守的）。尽管一些研究从实证角度考察这种约束是否会带来性能的提升，但它们得出了矛盾的结果，并未提供分析结果。",
