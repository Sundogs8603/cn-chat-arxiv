    "translated_abstract": "常见的点击率预测推荐模型往往存在特征级别的偏差，导致不公平的推荐和对用户的不准确推荐。虽然现有方法通过调整CTR模型的学习来解决这个问题，例如通过额外的优化目标，但它们未考虑这些模型内部是如何引起偏差的。为了填补这一研究空白，我们的研究对代表性的CTR模型进行了自上而下的分析。通过逐个阻塞训练好的CTR模型的不同组件，我们确定线性组件对特征级别偏差的关键贡献。我们对线性组件中权重的学习过程进行了理论分析，揭示了训练数据的群组属性如何影响权重。我们的实验和统计分析表明，在物品组之间不平衡的正样本比率与特征级别偏差之间存在强相关性。基于这种理解，",
