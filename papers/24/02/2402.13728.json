    "translated_abstract": "Deep Neural Collapse (DNC)指的是深度神经网络(DNNs)最后几层数据表示的惊人刚性结构。尽管这种现象在各种情境中都得到了测量，但其出现只有部分被理解。本文提供了充分证据，表明DNC主要是通过平均梯度外积(AGOP)进行深度特征学习而发生的。相比于解释神经坍塌的特征不可知方法，如无约束特征模型，这一进展更进一步。我们继续提供证据表明，权重的右奇异向量和奇异值是DNN中类内变异坍塌的主要因素。正如最近的研究所示，这种奇异结构与AGOP的高度相关。然后我们在实验和理论上证明了AGOP在随机初始化的神经网络中引发神经坍塌。",
