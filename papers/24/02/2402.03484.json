    "translated_abstract": "在科学研究中，基于引用文章寻找相关文章是一个重要的部分。像许多学术搜索引擎一样，PubMed拥有一个“类似文章”的功能，可以推荐与用户查看的当前文章相关的文章。解释推荐的文章对用户来说非常有用，特别是在文献搜索过程中。鉴于每年有超过一百万篇生物医学论文发表，解释推荐的相关文章将为研究人员和临床医生在寻找相关文章时提供便利。然而，目前大多数文献推荐系统都缺乏对其建议的解释。我们采用事后方法来解释推荐，通过识别类似文章标题中的相关词汇来实现。我们的主要贡献是通过重新利用PubMed用户查询日志中的560万个共点击文章对构建PubCLogs数据集。利用我们的PubCLogs数据集，我们训练了\"Highlight Similar Article Title\"模型。",
