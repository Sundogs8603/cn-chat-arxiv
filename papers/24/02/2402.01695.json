    "translated_abstract": "将概率世界模型安装到人工智能代理中，为人类与这些代理沟通和控制打开了一个高效的渠道。除了更新代理策略，人类还可以修改他们的内部世界模型，以影响代理的决策。然而，当前现有的世界模型难以适应人类，因为它们缺乏自然的通信界面。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了语言引导的世界模型（LWMs），它们可以通过阅读语言描述来捕捉环境动态。这些模型提高了代理的沟通效率，使人类能够通过简洁的语言反馈同时改变他们在多个任务上的行为。它们还使代理能够从最初用于指导人类的文本中进行自我学习。为了促进LWMs的发展，我们设计了一个基于MESSENGER游戏（Hanjie等人，2021）的挑战基准，需要对新场景进行组合泛化。",
