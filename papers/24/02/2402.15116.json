Concurrently, there is an emerging research trend focused on extending these LLM-powered AI agents into the multimodal domain. This extension enables AI agents to interpret and respond to diverse multimodal user queries, thereby handling more intricate and nuanced tasks. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of LLM-driven multimodal agents, which we refer to as large multimodal agents ( LMAs for short). First, we introduce the essential components involved in developing LMAs and categorize the current body of research into four distinct types. Subsequently, we review the collaborative frameworks integrating multiple LMAs , enhancing collective efficacy.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在推动基于文本的人工智能代理时取得了卓越表现，赋予它们类似于人类的决策和推理能力。同时，有一个新兴的研究趋势专注于将这些LLM驱动的人工智能代理扩展到多模态领域。本文系统地审查了LLM驱动的多模态代理，我们将其称为大型多模态代理（LMAs简称）。首先，我们介绍了发展LMAs所涉及的基本组成部分，并将当前的研究范畴分为四种不同类型。随后，我们审查了集成多个LMAs以增强集体效能的合作框架。这一领域面临的一个关键挑战是现有研究中使用的多样化评估方法。",
