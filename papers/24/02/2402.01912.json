Alternatively, natural language prompting of speaker identity and style has demonstrated promising results and provides an intuitive method of control. However, reliance on human-labeled descriptions prevents scaling to large datasets.   Our work bridges the gap between these two approaches. We propose a scalable method for labeling various aspects of speaker identity, style, and recording conditions.

    "translated_abstract": "基于大规模数据集训练的文本到语音模型展示了令人印象深刻的上下文学习能力和自然度。然而，在这些模型中，对说话人身份和风格的控制通常需要基于参考语音录音来进行条件约束，从而限制了创造性应用。相反，对说话人身份和风格的自然语言提示已经显示出了有希望的结果，并提供了一种直观的控制方法。然而，依赖于人工标注的描述限制了扩展到大规模数据集。我们的工作填补了这两种方法之间的差距。我们提出了一种可扩展的方法，用于标注说话人身份、风格和录音条件的各个方面。然后，我们将这种方法应用于一个45k小时的数据集，用于训练语音语言模型。此外，我们提出了简单的方法来提高音频保真度，尽管完全依赖于找到的数据，但性能显著优越于最近的工作。我们的结果展示了高保真度的语音生成。",
