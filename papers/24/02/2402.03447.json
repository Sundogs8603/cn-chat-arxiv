    "translated_abstract": "变量重要性在可解释机器学习中起到了关键作用，它帮助衡量因素对预测模型输出的影响。基于通过排列生成“空”特征的模型无关方法可以应用于此。这种分析通常在制药应用中使用，因为它能解释包括基于树的集成模型在内的黑盒模型。然而，变量重要性估算中存在的一个主要挑战和显著干扰因素是特征之间的相关性。最近，针对这个问题提出了几种基于特征 Knockoffs 的边际排列调整，如条件预测影响（CPI）等变量重要性度量方法。我们的工作重点是对这些方法进行评估和评估。我们首先提出了一项综合模拟研究，探讨了特征相关性对变量重要性评估的影响。然后我们在理论上证明了...",
