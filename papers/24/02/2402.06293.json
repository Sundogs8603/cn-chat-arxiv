    "translated_abstract": "不规则采样的多变量时间序列具有缺失值的概率预测是许多领域的重要问题，包括医疗保健、天文学和气候学。目前该任务的最先进方法仅估计单个通道和单个时间点上观测值的边际分布，假设了一个固定形状的参数分布。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的模型ProFITi，用于使用条件归一化流对具有缺失值的不规则采样时间序列进行概率预测。该模型学习了在过去观测和查询的通道和时间上条件下时间序列未来值的联合分布，而不假设底层分布的固定形状。作为模型组件，我们引入了一种新颖的可逆三角形注意力层和一个可逆的非线性激活函数，能够在整个实数线上进行转换。我们在四个数据集上进行了大量实验，并证明了该模型的提议。",
