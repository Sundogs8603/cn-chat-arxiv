    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.17633v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Text segmentation is a fundamental task in natural language processing, where documents are split into contiguous sections. However, prior research in this area has been constrained by limited datasets, which are either small in scale, synthesized, or only contain well-structured documents. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a novel benchmark YTSeg focusing on spoken content that is inherently more unstructured and both topically and structurally diverse. As part of this work, we introduce an efficient hierarchical segmentation model MiniSeg, that outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Lastly, we expand the notion of text segmentation to a more practical \"smart chaptering\" task that involves the segmentation of unstructured content, the generation of meaningful segment titles, and a potential real-time application of the models.",

    "translated_abstract": "文本分割是自然语言处理中的基本任务，其中文档被分割为连续的部分。然而，在这一领域的先前研究受到了有限数据集的限制，这些数据集要么规模小，要么是合成的，要么只包含结构良好的文件。在本文中，我们通过引入一个新颖的基准 YTSeg 来解决这些限制，重点关注口语内容，这种内容固有地更加无结构化，且在主题和结构上更加多样化。作为这项工作的一部分，我们引入了一种高效的分层分割模型 MiniSeg，它胜过了现有的最先进基线。最后，我们将文本分割的概念扩展到一个更实用的“智能章节化”任务，涉及对无结构化内容的分割，生成有意义的段落标题，以及模型的潜在实时应用。",
