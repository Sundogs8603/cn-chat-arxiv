    "translated_abstract": "组等变性是一种强大的归纳偏差，在各种深度学习任务中非常有用。然而，为一般群和域构建高效的等变网络是困难的。最近Finzi等人（2021）的工作直接解决了任意矩阵群的等变性约束，获得了等变MLP（EMLP）。但这种方法在扩展方面效果不佳，而在深度学习中，扩展是至关重要的。在这里，我们引入了Group Representation Networks（G-RepsNets），一种轻量级的等变网络，用于任意矩阵群，其中特征使用张量多项式表示。我们设计的关键直觉是，在神经网络的隐藏层中使用张量表示以及简单廉价的张量操作可以导致具有表现力的通用等变网络。我们发现G-RepsNet在具有O(5)、O(1, 3)和O(3)对称性的几项任务中与EMLP竞争力强。",
