    "translated_abstract": "程序归纳已经成为一种有前景的利用知识库帮助大型语言模型回答复杂知识密集型问题的范例。然而，程序归纳通常依赖于大量的并行问题-程序对，在LLM意识到给定KB的模式的同时，对于许多缺乏注释数据的低资源KB来说是具有挑战性的。为此，我们提出了KB-Plugin，一个即插即用框架，使LLM能够在任何低资源KB上诱导程序。首先，KB-Plugin采用自监督学习将给定KB的详细模式信息编码到一个可插拔模块，即模式插件。其次，KB-Plugin利用丰富资源KB中的丰富注释数据来训练另一个可插拔模块，即PI插件，该插件可以帮助LLM从任何KB的模式插件中提取与问题相关的模式信息，并利用此信息在该KB上诱导程序。在五个异构KBQA数据集上进行了实验。",
