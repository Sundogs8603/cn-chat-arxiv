    "translated_abstract": "在深度神经网络中，初始权重的选择对于网络的性能至关重要，因为随机选择的权重可能产生不同的输出，增加过拟合和欠拟合的概率。另一方面，基于向量的特征提取方法需要丰富的向量以实现更准确的分类。本文提出了InceptionCapsule方法来解决这两个问题。该方法利用迁移学习和Inception-ResNet模型，避免随机选择权重，从ImageNet中获取初始权重。同时，利用Inception中间层的输出生成丰富的向量。提取的向量被传递给装备有注意力机制的胶囊网络进行学习。使用Kvasir数据集和BUSI with GT数据集对这种方法进行了评估。该模型在5类分类上实现了97.62%的准确率，在8类分类上实现了94.30%的准确率。",
