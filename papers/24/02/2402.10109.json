In this work we propose a method to use LLMs to identify pieces of evidence in patient EHR data that indicate increased or decreased risk of specific diagnoses; our ultimate aim is to increase access to evidence and reduce diagnostic errors. In particular, we propose a Neural Additive Model to make predictions backed by evidence with individualized risk estimates at time-points where clinicians are still uncertain, aiming to specifically mitigate delays in diagnosis and errors stemming from an incomplete differential. To train such a model, it is necessary to infer temporally fine-grained retrospective labels of eventual \"true\" diagnoses.

    "translated_abstract": "许多诊断错误发生是因为临床医生无法轻易获取病人电子病历中的相关信息。本研究提出了一种使用LLMs方法来识别病人电子病历数据中指示特定诊断风险增加或减少的证据的方法，最终目标是增加证据的获取与减少诊断错误。我们提出了一种神经加性模型来进行带有个体化风险估计的以证据为后盾的预测，在临床医生仍然不确定的时间点上，旨在特别减轻诊断延迟和源于不完整鉴别的错误。为了训练这样一个模型，需要推断出事件性的“真实”诊断的时间粒度细致的回顾性标签。我们使用LLMs来保证输入文本是在可以进行自信的诊断之前的。我们使用LLMs来检索初始的证据池，然后进行细化。",
