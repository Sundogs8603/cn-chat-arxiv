    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们对神经网络（NN）技术在反褶积逆问题中的有效性进行了研究。我们考虑到NN的渐近极限，对应于高斯过程（GPs），其中参数的非线性性丢失。利用这些结果的GPs，我们通过在格子上使用蒙特卡洛技术模拟量子谐振子来解决反褶积逆问题。我们的研究结果表明，使用全连接的NN解决反褶积逆问题的结果不如使用从NN的渐近极限导出的GPs获得的结果好。此外，我们观察到随着层数的增加，训练后的NN的准确性接近于GPs的准确性。值得注意的是，其中一个GPs的解释与文献中的传统方法不同，提供了一种新的视角。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper studies the asymptotic behaviors of neural networks for solving deconvolution inverse problems and finds that using Gaussian processes derived from the asymptotic limits of neural networks yields better results than fully connected neural networks. Additionally, the accuracy of the trained neural networks approaches that of Gaussian processes with increasing layer width. One of these Gaussian processes offers a novel perspective compared to established methods in the literature."
