Despite their prowess, LLMs may fall short in understanding of complex, sociocultural, or domain-specific context, potentially leading to incorrect annotations. Therefore, we advocate a collaborative approach where humans and LLMs work together to produce reliable and high-quality labels. We present MEGAnno+, a human-LLM collaborative annotation system that offers effective LLM agent and annotation management, convenient and robust LLM annotation, and exploratory verification of LLM labels by humans.",

    "translated_abstract": "大语言模型（LLMs）可以比人类更快速、更便宜地为各种自然语言处理任务标记数据。尽管它们很强大，但LLMs可能在理解复杂、社会文化或领域特定上下文方面存在缺陷，这可能导致错误的注释。因此，我们提倡一种人类和LLMs共同合作的方法，以产生可靠且高质量的标签。我们提出MEGAnno+，这是一个人类-LLM协作的标注系统，提供有效的LLM代理和注释管理，便捷且稳固的LLM标注，以及人类对LLM标签的探索性验证。",
