    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了语言指导机器人团队的任务规划问题。任务用自然语言（NL）表示，要求机器人在各种位置和语义对象上应用它们的能力（例如移动、操作和感知）。最近几篇论文通过利用预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）设计有效的多机器人计划来解决类似的规划问题。然而，这些方法缺乏任务性能和安全性保证。为了解决这一挑战，我们引入了一种新的基于分布式LLM的规划器，能够实现高任务成功率。这是通过利用符合预测（CP）来实现的，CP是一种基于分布的不确定性量化工具，可以在黑盒模型中对其固有不确定性进行推理。CP允许所提出的多机器人规划器以分布方式推理其固有不确定性，使得机器人在充分信任时能够做出个别决策。",
