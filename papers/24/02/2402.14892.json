    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了SigNova，一个新的半监督框架，用于检测流数据中的异常值。尽管我们最初的例子侧重于在射电天文学领域内检测数字信号中的射频干扰（RFI），但重要的是要注意，SigNova的适用范围扩展到任何类型的流数据。该框架由三个主要组件组成。首先，我们使用特征转换从观测序列中提取一组规范的摘要统计信息。这使我们能够将可变长度的可见性样本表示为有限维特征向量。其次，每个特征向量被分配一个新颖性评分，计算为到无RFI训练集中最近邻的马氏距离。通过设定这些分数的阈值，我们识别出偏离无RFI可见性样本预期行为的观察范围，而不依赖于严格的分布假设。",
