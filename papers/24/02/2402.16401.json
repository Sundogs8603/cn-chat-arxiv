    "title": "A Stationary Equilibrium Model of Green Technology Adoption with Endogenous Carbon Price",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.16401v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a stationary equilibrium model for a competitive industry which endogenously determines the carbon price necessary to achieve a given emission target. In the model, firms are identified by their level of technology and make production, entry, and abatement decisions. Polluting firms are subject to a carbon price and abatement is formulated as an irreversible investment, which entails a sunk cost and results in the firms switching to a carbon neutral technology. In equilibrium, we identify a carbon price and a stationary distribution of incumbent, polluting firms, that guarantee the compliance with a certain emission target. Our general theoretical framework is complemented with a case study with Brownian technology shocks, in which we discuss some implications of our model. We observe that a carbon pricing system alongside installation subsidies and tax benefits for green firms trigger earlier investmen",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出并分析了一个竞争产业的静态均衡模型，该模型内生确定了实现给定排放目标所需的碳价格。在模型中，企业根据其技术水平进行识别，并做出生产、进入和减排决策。污染企业需支付碳价格，减排被构建为一项不可逆投资，其中包括固定成本，并导致企业转向碳中性技术。在均衡状态下，我们确定了一个碳价格和现有污染企业的静态分布，以确保符合特定的排放目标。我们的一般理论框架与布朗技术冲击的案例研究相互补充，其中我们讨论了模型的一些影响。我们观察到，碳定价系统连同安装补贴和对绿色企业的税收优惠可以促进较早的投资。",
