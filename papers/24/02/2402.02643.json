However, existing LLMs have several limitations: hallucination, high cost, and low accuracy for complicated tasks. To address these challenges, we design LLMDB, an LLM-enhanced data management paradigm which has generalizability and high inference ability while avoiding hallucination, reducing LLM cost, and achieving high accuracy.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，针对优化数据管理问题的机器学习（ML）技术得到了广泛研究和广泛部署。然而，传统的ML方法在泛化能力（适应不同情景）和推理能力（理解上下文）方面存在局限性。幸运的是，大型语言模型（LLMs）表现出高度的泛化能力和人类竞争能力，对于数据管理任务（如数据库诊断、数据库调优）具有潜在的应用前景。然而，现有的LLMs存在一些限制：虚构、高成本以及对复杂任务的低准确性。为了应对这些挑战，我们设计了LLMDB，一种使用LLM增强的数据管理范式，具有良好的泛化能力和高推理能力，同时避免了虚构，降低了LLM成本，提高了准确性。LLMDB通过LLM的微调和提示工程嵌入领域特定知识以避免虚构。LLMDB通过减少LLMs的高成本 addresses challenges: hallucination, high cost, low accuracy-",
