    "translated_abstract": "在增强现实中呈现的文本为用户提供了就地、实时信息。然而，在从事认知需求高的AR任务时，尤其是在头戴式显示器上呈现时，这些内容很难快速理解。我们提出了ARTiST，这是一个自动文本简化系统，它使用少量示例提示和GPT-3模型，专门为增强现实优化文本长度和语义内容。我们的系统结合了自定义的误差校准模型和少量示例提示，以整合句法、词汇、阐述和内容简化技术，并为头戴式显示器生成简化的AR文本。一项包括七名用户和三名专家的形成性研究开发了这一系统。一项包括16名用户的实证研究结果表明，ARTiST减轻了认知负荷，并显着提高了性能，相比较于未修改的文本和传统方法修改的文本。",
