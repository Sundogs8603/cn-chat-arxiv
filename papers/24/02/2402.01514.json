    "translated_abstract": "响应最近对通过多元宇宙分析来应对机器学习中的可靠性和稳健性问题的呼吁，我们提出了PRESTO，一种系统的框架，用于映射依赖于潜在表示的机器学习模型的多元宇宙。尽管这些模型得到了广泛的应用，但对它们嵌入的变异性仍然不被充分理解，导致了不必要的复杂性和不可靠的表示。我们的框架使用持续同调来表征不同组合的多样化机器学习方法、(超)参数配置和数据集所产生的潜在空间，从而使我们能够测量它们之间的成对(非)相似性并对其分布进行统计推理。正如我们在理论上和实证上所证明的那样，我们的流程保持了潜在表示集合的理想特性，可以用于进行敏感性分析、检测异常嵌入或高效有效地导航超参。",
