    "translated_abstract": "准确预测蛋白质-配体结合结构，即分子对接任务对于药物设计至关重要，但仍然具有挑战性。尽管深度学习显示出了潜力，但现有方法通常依赖于完整蛋白质结构（对接，且在现实任务中不可达）或忽略口袋侧链构象，导致有限的实用性和不切实际的构象预测。为填补这些差距，我们引入了一个未经探索的任务，命名为柔性对接，以同时预测配体和口袋侧链的姿势，并引入了一种扩展到几何流形的新型扩散桥生成模型 Re-Dock。具体而言，我们提出了受牛顿-欧拉方程启发的能量到几何映射，以共同建模结合能和构象，以反映能量约束对接生成过程。我们在设计的基准数据集上进行了全面的实验，包括apo-dock和cross-dock d",
