The billion-scale citation relations between papers hinder researchers from understanding the evolution of science efficiently. To date, there is still a lack of an accurate and scalable dataset constructed by professional researchers to identify the direct source of their studied papers, based on which automatic algorithms can be developed to expand the evolutionary knowledge of science. In this paper, we study the problem of paper source tracing (PST) and construct a high-quality and ever-increasing dataset PST-Bench in computer science. Based on PST-Bench, we reveal several intriguing discoveries, such as the differing evolution patterns across various topics.

    "translated_abstract": "追踪研究论文的来源是研究人员面临的一项基本但具有挑战性的任务。论文之间数十亿级的引用关系阻碍了研究人员有效理解科学的演变过程。迄今为止，仍然缺乏由专业研究人员构建的准确且可扩展的数据集，以识别研究论文的直接来源，基于这一点，可以开发自动算法来扩展科学的演变知识。本文研究了论文来源追踪（PST）问题，并在计算机科学领域构建了一个高质量且不断增长的数据集 PST-Bench。基于 PST-Bench，我们揭示了几个有趣的发现，例如不同主题之间的演化模式差异。对各种方法的探索凸显了 PST-Bench 的难度，指出了该主题的潜在研究方向。数据集和代码已在 https://github.com 上提供。",
