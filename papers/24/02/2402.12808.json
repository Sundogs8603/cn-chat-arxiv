In this paper, we formulate the problem of estimation of NHPPs from finite and limited data as a learning generalization problem. We mathematically show that while binning methods are essential for the estimation of NHPPs, they pose a threat of overfitting when the amount of data is limited.

    "translated_abstract": "泊松过程，尤其是非齐次泊松过程(NHPP)，是一种在许多实际应用中非常重要的计数过程。目前，文献中几乎所有的工作都致力于使用非数据驱动的分箱方法对具有无穷数据的NHPP进行估计。本文将有限和有限数据下的NHPP估计问题公式化为一个学习泛化问题。我们在数学上证明，尽管分箱方法对于估计NHPPs很重要，但在数据量有限时会带来过拟合的风险。我们提出了一个正则化学习NHPPs的框架，其中包括两种新的自适应和数据驱动的分箱方法，帮助消除分箱参数的即兴调整。我们在合成和实际数据集上对我们的方法进行了实验证明了其有效性。",
