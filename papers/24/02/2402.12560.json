    "translated_abstract": "语言模型（LMs）已被证明是心理语言学研究的强大工具，但大多数先前的研究集中在纯行为测量（例如，惊奇比较）。同时，模型可解释性的研究已开始阐明塑造LM行为的抽象因果机制。为了帮助将这些研究领域更紧密地联系在一起，我们推出了CausalGym。我们改编并扩展了SyntaxGym任务套件，以基准测试解释方法影响模型行为的能力。为了说明CausalGym的用途，我们研究了pythia模型（从14M到6.9B）并评估了广泛解释方法的因果有效性，包括线性探针和分布对齐搜索（DAS）。我们发现DAS优于其他方法，因此我们使用它来研究pythia-1b中两个困难的语言现象的学习轨迹：负极性项许可和填充-间隙d。",
