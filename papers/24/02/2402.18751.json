Water limiting stress, i.e. drought, emerges as a significant risk for soybean production, underscoring the need for advancements in stress monitoring for crop breeding and production. This project combines multi-modal information to identify the most effective and efficient automated methods to investigate drought response. We investigated a set of diverse soybean accessions using multiple sensors in a time series high-throughput phenotyping manner to: (1) develop a pipeline for rapid classification of soybean drought stress symptoms, and (2) investigate methods for early detection of drought stress. We utilized high-throughput time-series phenotyping using UAVs and sensors in conjunction with machine learning (ML) analytics, which offered a swift and efficient means of phenotyping.
