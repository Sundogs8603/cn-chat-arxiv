    "translated_abstract": "文本到SQL语义解析在近年来取得了显著进展，各种模型在具有挑战性的Spider基准测试上展示了令人印象深刻的性能。然而，研究表明，即使面对先前（精确）解析表达式的轻微扰动，这些模型通常也很难泛化。这主要是由于Spider中问题的语言形式过于具体、不自然且变化有限。在这项工作中，我们使用数据增强来提升文本到SQL解析器对自然语言变体的鲁棒性。现有的方法通过在Spider上训练的模型生成问题重组，或仅引入局部变化。相比之下，我们利用大型语言模型的能力生成更真实和多样的问题。仅使用几个提示，我们在Spider中的问题数量增加了一倍。在这个增强的数据集上进行训练可以显著提高解析器的性能。",
