    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11968v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) has largely focused on modelling standardized languages. More recently, attention has increasingly shifted to local, non-standardized languages and dialects. However, the relevant speaker populations' needs and wishes with respect to NLP tools are largely unknown. In this paper, we focus on dialects and regional languages related to German -- a group of varieties that is heterogeneous in terms of prestige and standardization. We survey speakers of these varieties (N=327) and present their opinions on hypothetical language technologies for their dialects. Although attitudes vary among subgroups of our respondents, we find that respondents are especially in favour of potential NLP tools that work with dialectal input (especially audio input) such as virtual assistants, and less so for applications that produce dialectal output such as machine translation or spellcheckers.",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理（NLP）主要集中于对标准化语言进行建模。最近，关注点逐渐转向了本地、非标准化语言和方言。然而，与NLP工具相关的说话者群体的需求和愿望在很大程度上是未知的。本文关注德语方言和区域语言，这是一组在声望和标准化方面异质性的语言变体。我们对这些语言变体的说话者进行了调查（N=327），并介绍了他们对于他们方言的假想语言技术的意见。尽管我们的受访者子群体之间的态度有所不同，但我们发现受访者特别支持能够处理方言输入的潜在NLP工具（特别是音频输入），比如虚拟助手，而对于产生方言输出的应用，比如机器翻译或拼写检查程序，支持程度要低一些。",
    "tldr": "德语方言和区域语言说话者更倾向于支持能够处理方言输入的自然语言处理工具，比如虚拟助手，对于产生方言输出的应用则支持程度相对较低。",
