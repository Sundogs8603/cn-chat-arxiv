To aid in this capability, the recently proposed Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) has been effectively applied across numerous tasks in literature to perform targeted subset selection with the aid of a exemplar query set. However, all such works are deficient in providing theoretical guarantees for SMI in terms of its sensitivity to a subset's relevance and coverage of the targeted data. For the first time, we provide such guarantees by deriving similarity-based bounds on quantities related to relevance and coverage of the targeted data. With these bounds, we show that the SMI functions, which have empirically shown success in multiple applications, are theoretically sound in achieving good query relevance and query coverage.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着在机器学习任务中使用的数据量增加，定位特定数据子集的能力变得越来越重要。为了帮助实现这一能力，最近提出的子模互信息（SMI）已经在文献中有效应用于执行使用示例查询集进行定位子集选择的多个任务。然而，所有这些工作都没有在理论上保证SMI对于子集相关性和目标数据的覆盖性的敏感性。我们首次通过推导与相关性和目标数据覆盖相关的基于相似度的界限，提供了此类保证。通过这些界限，我们展示了在多个应用中已经表现成功的SMI函数在理论上确保实现良好的查询相关性和查询覆盖。",
