    "translated_abstract": "随着计算思维(CT)在K-12教育中继续普及，像Scratch这样的已建立的CT平台面临着迎合这些年幼学习者的挑战，特别是小学生(6-12岁)。通过与Scratch专家的形成性调查，我们发现儿童在自主学习Scratch过程中面临三个关键障碍：项目规划中的创作难题、资源创建中的创造力受限以及实现过程中缺乏编码指导。为了解决这些问题，我们介绍了ChatScratch，一种AI增强系统，用于促进年幼儿童的自主编程学习。ChatScratch采用了结构化互动故事板和视觉提示来克服创作障碍，集成了数字绘画和高级图像生成技术来提升创造力，并利用专门针对Scratch的大型语言模型(Large Language Models, LLMs)提供专业的编码指导。我们的研究表明，与Scratch相比，ChatScratch能够有效地提高儿童的编程效率。",
