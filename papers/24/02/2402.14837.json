However, the sheer number of available prompt engineering techniques creates an overwhelming landscape for practitioners looking to utilize these tools. For the most efficient and effective use of LLMs, it is important to compile a comprehensive list of prompting techniques and establish a standardized, interdisciplinary categorization framework. In this survey, we examine some of the most well-known prompting techniques from both academic and practical viewpoints and classify them into seven distinct categories. We present an overview of each category, aiming to clarify their unique contributions and showcase their practical applications in real-world examples in order to equip fellow practitioners with a structured framework for understanding and categorizing prompting techniqu",

    "translated_abstract": "由于大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，最近用提示语来编程这些模型引起了人们的极大关注。然而，现有提示工程技术的数量庞大，对于希望利用这些工具的从业者来说，这构成了一个令人难以应对的挑战。为了最有效地利用LLMs，编制一个全面的提示技术清单并建立一个标准化的跨学科分类框架是很重要的。本调查研究了一些最知名的提示技术，从学术和实践角度对它们进行了分类，分为七个不同的类别。我们概述了每个类别，旨在澄清它们的独特贡献，并展示它们在真实世界示例中的实际应用，以为同行从业者提供一个结构化框架，帮助他们理解和归类提示技术。",
