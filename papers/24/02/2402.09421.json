We trained two generators, the first one learns the characteristics of depressed brain activity, and the second one learns the characteristics of control group's brain activity.

Thus it is possible to determine the category corresponding to a certain segment of EEG signal. ",

    "translated_abstract": "抑郁症是一种非常常见但严重的情绪障碍。在本文中，我们根据三个生理定律构建了一个生成检测网络（GDN）。我们的目标是希望神经网络能够学习与脑电图信号相关的脑活动，并根据脑活动重新生成目标电极信号。我们训练了两个生成器，第一个生成器学习抑郁症脑活动的特征，第二个生成器学习对照组脑活动的特征。在测试中，将一个脑电信号片段分别输入两个生成器，如果脑电信号与脑活动的关系符合某一类别的特征，那么由相应类别生成器生成的信号更接近原始信号。因此，可以确定与某一段脑电信号对应的类别。",
