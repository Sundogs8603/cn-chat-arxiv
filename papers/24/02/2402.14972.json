    "translated_abstract": "词汇简化（LS）自动替换难以理解的单词为更易读的替代词，同时保留句子的原始含义。LS是文本简化的前身，旨在改善文本对各种目标人群的可访问性，包括儿童、第二语言学习者、阅读障碍或低识字率的人群。存在一些专门用于LS的数据集，这些数据集专注于LS流程中的一个或两个子任务。然而，目前尚未开发出一个覆盖所有LS子任务的单个LS数据集。我们提出了MultiLS，这是第一个允许创建多任务LS数据集的LS框架。我们还提出了MultiLS-PT，这是第一个使用MultiLS框架创建的数据集。我们通过执行所有LS子任务，包括（1）词汇复杂性预测（LCP）、（2）替代词生成和（3）替代词排名，展示了MultiLS-PT的潜力。",
