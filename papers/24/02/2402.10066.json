    "translated_abstract": "从灵长类动物大脑引发的证据累积过程中获得灵感，借鉴了认知心理学和神经科学的模型，本文介绍了NYCTALE框架，一种神经启发的基于证据累积的Transformer架构。提出的神经启发的NYCTALE在个性化医学领域，特别是肺癌诊断方面提供了一种创新的途径。作为自然界中的一种小型猫头鹰，Nyctales以其夜间行为而闻名，主要在夜晚进行捕猎。NYCTALE以类似警惕的方式运作，即以基于证据的方式处理数据并动态/自适应地进行预测。与传统的基于计算机断层扫描（CT）的深度学习（DL）模型不同，NYCTALE仅在累积足够数量的证据时才进行预测。换句话说，对于每个人，只处理所有或预定义的CT切片的子集，而不是全部切片。",
