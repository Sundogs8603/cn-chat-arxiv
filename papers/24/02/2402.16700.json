    "translated_abstract": "近年来，转换器模型已经彻底改变了自然语言处理（NLP），在各种任务中取得了出色的结果，包括情感分析（SA）。因此，目前用于SA的最新方法主要依赖于转换器模型， 在基准数据集上取得了令人印象深刻的准确性水平。本文展示了进一步提高这些SA集成模型准确性的关键在于不仅包括转换器模型，还包括传统NLP模型，尽管后者相对于转换器模型处于劣势。然而，正如我们实验证明的，这需要改变集成模型的构建方式，具体依赖于我们提出的分层集成构建（HEC）算法。我们在八个典型SA数据集上的实证研究表明，通过HEC结构化的混合模型类型的集成明显优于传统的集成模型。",
