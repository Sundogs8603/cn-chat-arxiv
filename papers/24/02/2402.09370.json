    "translated_abstract": "我们构建了伪随机纠错码（或简称为伪随机码），它们是具有以下特性的纠错码：对于任何计算受限的对手来说，任意多个编码词都是伪随机的。通过解码密钥，可以高效地纠正有错误的编码词。我们构建了对替换错误和删除错误具有强鲁棒性的伪随机码，其中伪随机性基于标准密码学假设。具体而言，伪随机性基于LPN问题的$2^{O(\\sqrt{n})}$困难程度，或者基于LPN问题和低密度下的插入异或问题的多项式困难程度。",
    "tldr": "我们构建了一种伪随机纠错码，它对替换和删除错误具有鲁棒性，并且可以高效解码。我们还使用伪随机码提出了一种对语言模型输出进行水印处理的方案，该方案对裁剪和随机替换、删除具有恒定的鲁棒性。",
