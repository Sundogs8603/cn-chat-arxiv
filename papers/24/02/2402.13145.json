This paper introduces a large-scale high quality annotated Chinese Metaphor Corpus, which comprises around 28K sentences drawn from a diverse range of Chinese literary sources, such as poems, prose, song lyrics, etc. To ensure the accuracy and consistency of our annotations, we introduce a comprehensive set of guidelines. These guidelines address the facets of metaphor annotation, including identifying tenors, vehicles, and grounds to handling the complexities of similes, personifications, juxtapositions, and hyperboles. Breaking tradition, our approach to metaphor generation emphasizes grounds and their distinct features rather than the conventional combination of tenors and vehicles. By integrating \"ground\" as a CoT (Chain of Thoughts) input, we are able to generate metaphors that re",

    "translated_abstract": "隐喻是人类语言和文学中显著的修辞手法，因为它们增添了色彩、形象和强调，以增强有效交流。本文介绍了一个大规模高质量的带注释中文隐喻语料库，包括约28K句来自各种中文文学来源（如诗歌、散文、歌词等）。为确保注释的准确性和一致性，我们提出了一套全面的指南。这些指南涵盖了隐喻标注的方面，包括识别对象、载体和基础，以处理比喻、拟人、并列和夸张等复杂性。打破传统，我们的隐喻生成方法强调基础及其独特特征，而不是传统的对象和载体组合。通过将“基础”作为“CoT”（思维链）输入进行整合，我们能够生成重新",
