Ultrasound images tend to have a lot of noise, making it difficult to segment out important structures. In this project, we developed ClickSAM, which fine-tunes the Segment Anything Model using click prompts for ultrasound images. ClickSAM has two stages of training: the first stage is trained on single-click prompts centered in the ground-truth contours, and the second stage focuses on improving the model performance through additional positive and negative click prompts. By comparing the first stage predictions to the ground-truth masks, true positive, false positive, and false negative segments are calculated. Positive clicks are generated using the true ",

    "translated_abstract": "由于其卓越的分割准确性、多样的输入提示、训练能力和高效的模型设计，新发布的Segment Anything Model（SAM）成为图像处理中流行的工具。然而，SAM当前的模型是在一个多样的数据集上训练的，而这些数据集并没有针对医学图像，尤其是超声图像。超声图像往往有很多噪声，这使得分割重要结构变得困难。在这个项目中，我们开发了ClickSAM，它使用点击提示对超声图像进行Segment Anything Model的精细调整。ClickSAM有两个训练阶段：第一阶段使用位于真实轮廓中心的单击提示进行训练，第二阶段通过额外的正负点击提示来改善模型性能。通过将第一阶段的预测与真实掩膜进行比较，计算出真正正、假正和假负段。正点击使用真实掩膜中的真实",
