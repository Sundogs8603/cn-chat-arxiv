    "abstract": "We study a general clustering setting in which we have $n$ elements to be clustered, and we aim to perform as few queries as possible to an oracle that returns a noisy sample of the similarity between two elements. Our setting encompasses many application domains in which the similarity function is costly to compute and inherently noisy. We propose two novel formulations of online learning problems rooted in the paradigm of Pure Exploration in Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandits (PE-CMAB): fixed confidence and fixed budget settings. For both settings, we design algorithms that combine a sampling strategy with a classic approximation algorithm for correlation clustering and study their theoretical guarantees. Our results are the first examples of polynomial-time algorithms that work for the case of PE-CMAB in which the underlying offline optimization problem is NP-hard.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个常见的聚类设置，其中我们需要对n个元素进行聚类，并且我们的目标是尽可能少地向返回两个元素相似性的有噪声的oracle查询。我们的设置涵盖了许多应用领域，在这些领域中，相似性函数计算起来成本高并且 inherently noisy。我们提出了两种基于纯在组合多臂赌博机探索范式(PE-CMAB)的在线学习问题的新颖表达方法固定置信度和固定预算设置。对于这两种设置，我们设计了将抽样策略与经典的相关聚类近似算法相结合的算法，并研究了它们的理论保证。我们的结果是这样的：这些算法是第一个在底层离线优化问题为NP-hard的情况下运行的多项式时间算法的例子。",
