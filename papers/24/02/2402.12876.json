    "translated_abstract": "这种创新的联邦多任务学习（FMTL）方法整合了联邦学习（FL）和多任务学习（MTL）的优点，能够在多任务学习数据集上进行协作模型训练。然而，目前在该领域缺乏整合FL和MTL独特特性的综合评估方法。本文通过引入一个新颖的框架，FMTL-Bench，填补了这一空白，用于系统评估FMTL范式。这个基准涵盖了数据、模型和优化算法级别的各个方面，并包括七组比较实验，封装了广泛的非独立同分布（Non-IID）数据分区场景。我们提出了对比各种指标的基线的系统过程，并对通信开支、时间和能源消耗进行了案例研究。通过我们的大量实验，我们旨在提供有价值的",
