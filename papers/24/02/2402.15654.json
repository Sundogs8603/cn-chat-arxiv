We construct a simple simulated environment and demonstrate examples of where, in a zero-shot setting, both text and multimodal LLMs display atomic world knowledge about various objects but fail to compose this knowledge in correct solutions for an object manipulation and placement task. We also use BLIP, a vision-language model trained with more sophisticated cross-modal attention, to identify cases relevant to object physical properties that that model fails to ground. Finally, we present a procedure for discovering the relevant properties of objects in the environment and propose a method to distill this knowledge back into the LLM.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们探讨了LLMs在现实环境中进行物理推理问题解决的能力。我们构建了一个简单的模拟环境，并展示了在零-shot设置中，文本和多模态LLMs展示了关于各种物体的原子世界知识，但在物体操作和放置任务的正确解决方案中未能将这些知识组合在一起。我们还使用了BLIP，这是一个训练有交叉模态注意力的视觉语言模型，识别了与对象物理属性相关的导致该模型无法基于的案例。最后，我们提出了一种发现环境中对象相关属性的程序，并提出了一种方法将这些知识提炼回LLM中。",
