    "translated_abstract": "实验是人工智能研究的固有部分，它可以收集定量观察数据，验证假设，并为其重新制定提供证据。因此，实验必须与研究目的一致，适当地处理每种情况下的相关问题。不幸的是，文献中充斥着一些实验缺乏严谨性和说服力的研究，往往是为了支持先前的信念，而不是回答相关的研究问题。本文我们主要关注元启发式优化领域，因为这是我们主要的工作领域，也是我们观察到存在不当行为的地方。即使我们在本文中将重点限制在研究的实验部分，我们的主要目标是激发对我们工作的真诚批判性评估，引发个人和社群层面的反思过程。",
    "tldr": "这篇文章呼吁停下来思考我们想要进行什么样的研究，特别是在实验设计方面，避免不严谨和不令人信服的实验，改变以支持先前信念为目的的态度，提倡对个人和社群的真诚批判性评估和反思。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper calls for a pause in research to reflect on the kind of research we want to conduct, particularly in experimental design, to avoid non-rigorous and unconvincing experiments, and to encourage sincere critical assessment and reflection at both individual and community levels."
