    "translated_abstract": "部分标签学习 (PLL) 是一种弱监督学习范式，其中每个训练实例都与一组候选标签 (部分标签) 成对，其中一个是真正的标签。嘈杂部分标签学习 (NPLL) 放宽了这个约束，允许一些部分标签不包含真正的标签，增加了问题的实用性。我们的工作集中在 NPLL 上，并提出了一个简约的框架 SARI，通过利用加权最近邻算法将伪标签分配给图像。然后，这些伪标签与图像配对用于训练深度神经网络分类器，采用标签平滑和标准正则化技术。随后，利用分类器的特征和预测结果来改进和提高伪标签的准确性。SARI结合了文献中基于平均策略 (伪标签) 和基于识别策略 (分类器训练)的优点。我们进行了详尽的实验评估，验证了SARI的有效性和性能提升。",
