    "translated_abstract": "高血压被定义为高于正常的血压，它在公共卫生领域具有至关重要的意义，因为它是各种心血管疾病的重要先兆，并且显著 contributed to the elevated mortality rates worldwide。然而，许多现有的血压测量技术和标准可能存在偏差，因为它们未考虑临床结果、合并症或人口统计因素，使其在诊断目的上没有结论性。针对这些变量，在研究血压测量方差方面，有限的以数据驱动的研究。在本研究中，我们采用了GPT-35-turbo，一种大型语言模型（LLM），从PubMed的2500万个摘要的数据集中自动提取了男性和女性的血压平均值和标准差数值。符合我们预定义的纳入标准的摘要文章有993篇（即具有与血压、血压单位（如mmHg）和提及相关性的参考文献）。",
