    "translated_abstract": "人类活动已与热带气旋向极地迁移、气旋极端降水以及重大飓风比例增加相关联。了解过去热带气旋的趋势和变化对于预测气候变化对人类社会的未来影响至关重要。然而，基于有限观测数据，过去的热带气旋结构和能量趋势仍存在不确定性。主观分析和时空异质的“最佳路径”数据集导致对气候变化对气旋响应的评估缺乏信心。本文利用深度学习重建了过去的“观测”，并在1981年至2020年期间获得了客观的全球热带气旋风场资料，有助于全面研究热带气旋的结构和能量。通过使用包含最佳路径和数值模型分析2004年至2018年热带气旋的独特标记数据进行训练，我们的模型将多通道卫星图像转换为0-750公里的轴对称地表风速风场。该模型通过比较复杂的深度神经网络提取特征的方法，可以更精确地区分不同的天气系统，包括台风强度、反射率、风速和气温等。",
