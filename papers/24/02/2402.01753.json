    "translated_abstract": "生成对抗网络（GAN）模型可以合成高质量的音频信号，同时确保快速采样生成。然而，它们很难训练，并且容易出现模式坍缩和发散等问题。本文介绍了一种基于HiFi-GAN的神经声码器——SpecDiff-GAN，该模型最初用于从mel频谱图进行语音合成。在我们的模型中，通过一个前向扩散过程来增强训练稳定性，该过程在输入鉴别器之前向真实样本和伪造样本注入来自高斯分布的噪声。我们进一步改进了模型，通过利用谱形状噪声分布来使鉴别器的任务更具挑战性。然后，我们在几个数据集上展示了我们提出的模型在语音和音乐合成方面的优点。我们的实验证实，与几个基准模型相比，我们的模型在音频质量和效率方面表现出色。",
