    "translated_abstract": "最近，Ainsworth等人展示了使用权重匹配（WM）来最小化排列搜索模型参数中的$L_2$距离有效地识别满足线性模式连接性（LMC）的排列的方法，其中，在两个具有不同种子的独立训练模型之间的线性路径上的损失保持几乎恒定。本文通过WM提供了LMC的理论分析，这对于理解随机梯度下降的有效性及其在模型合并等领域的应用至关重要。我们首先通过实验和理论分析表明，WM找到的排列并不显着减少两个模型之间的$L_2$距离，而LMC的出现并不仅仅是由于WM本身的距离减小。然后，我们提供了理论洞见，表明排列可以改变每层权重矩阵的奇异向量的方向，但不能改变奇异值。这一发现表明，WM找到的排列主要改变了权重矩阵的方向，而不是奇异值。",
