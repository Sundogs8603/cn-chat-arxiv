    "title": "A Scoping Review of Energy Load Disaggregation",
    "abstract": "Energy load disaggregation can contribute to balancing power grids by enhancing the effectiveness of demand-side management and promoting electricity-saving behavior through increased consumer awareness. However, the field currently lacks a comprehensive overview. To address this gap, this paper con-ducts a scoping review of load disaggregation domains, data types, and methods, by assessing 72 full-text journal articles. The findings reveal that domestic electricity consumption is the most researched area, while others, such as industrial load disaggregation, are rarely discussed. The majority of research uses relatively low-frequency data, sampled between 1 and 60 seconds. A wide variety of methods are used, and artificial neural networks are the most common, followed by optimization strategies, Hidden Markov Models, and Graph Signal Processing approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "通过增强需求侧管理的效果和提升消费者意识来促进行为节电，电能负荷分解可以为平衡电力网络做出贡献。然而，该领域当前缺乏全面的概述。为了填补这一空白，本文通过评估72篇全文期刊文章对负荷分解领域、数据类型和方法进行了范围回顾。研究发现，家庭电力消费是最研究的领域，而其他领域如工业负荷分解则很少讨论。大多数研究使用相对较低频率的数据，采样间隔为1至60秒。研究采用了各种各样的方法，其中最常见的是人工神经网络，其次是优化策略、隐藏马尔可夫模型和图信号处理方法。",
