    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统在电子商务网站和在线平台中被广泛使用，以应对信息过载。然而，现有系统主要依赖历史数据和用户反馈，难以捕捉用户意图转变。最近，提出了基于知识库（KB）的模型来整合专家知识，但它们难以适应新商品和不断发展的电子商务环境。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的基于大型语言模型的互补知识增强推荐系统（LLM-KERec）。它引入了一个实体提取器，从商品和用户信息中提取统一概念术语。为了提供具有成本效益且可靠的先验知识，根据实体的流行度和特定策略生成实体对。大型语言模型确定每个实体对中的互补关系，构建一个互补知识图。此外，一个新的...",
