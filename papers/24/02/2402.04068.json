    "abstract": "Machine learning models, particularly language models, are notoriously difficult to introspect. Black-box models can mask both issues in model training and harmful biases. For human-in-the-loop processes, opaque predictions can drive lack of trust, limiting a model's impact even when it performs effectively. To address these issues, we introduce Retrieve to Explain (R2E). R2E is a retrieval-based language model that prioritizes amongst a pre-defined set of possible answers to a research question based on the evidence in a document corpus, using Shapley values to identify the relative importance of pieces of evidence to the final prediction. R2E can adapt to new evidence without retraining, and incorporate structured data through templating into natural language. We assess on the use case of drug target identification from published scientific literature, where we show that the model outperforms an industry-standard genetics-based approach on predicting clinical trial outcomes.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习模型，尤其是语言模型，往往难以深入分析。黑盒模型可能掩盖了模型训练中的问题和有害偏差。对于人机协作过程来说，不透明的预测可能导致缺乏信任，限制模型的影响，即使模型的性能很好。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了检索以解释（Retrieve to Explain，简称R2E）。R2E是一种基于检索的语言模型，根据文档语料库中的证据，使用Shapley值来确定证据对最终预测的相对重要性，并根据自然语言模板将结构化数据纳入其中。R2E能够在不重新训练的情况下适应新的证据，并且能够通过模板化将结构化数据纳入到自然语言中。我们在通过分析已发表的科学文献进行药物靶点鉴定的实际案例中进行了评估，结果显示该模型在预测临床试验结果方面优于行业标准的基因学方法。",
