It offers a detailed overview of the counterfeit token fraud process, along with a systematic summary of characteristics associated with such fraudulent activities observed in Uniswap. The study primarily examines the relationship between revenue from counterfeit token scams and their defining characteristics, and analyzes the influence of market economic factors such as return on market capitalization and price return on Ethereum. Key findings include a significant increase in overall transactions of counterfeit tokens on their first day of fraud, and a rise in upfront fraud costs leading to corresponding increases in revenue. Furthermore, a negative correlation is identified between the total revenue of counterfeit tokens and the volatility of Ethereum market capitalization return, while price return vol",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇文章对Uniswap上的假币所产生的总收入的决定因素进行了经验调查。文章详细介绍了假币欺诈过程，并系统总结了Uniswap上观察到的此类欺诈活动的特征。研究主要考察了来自假币欺诈的收入与其定义特征之间的关系，并分析了市场经济因素（如市值回报率和以太坊价格回报率）对其的影响。关键发现包括假币在欺诈第一天的总交易量显著增加，以及前期欺诈成本上升导致相应收入增加。此外，假币的总收入与以太坊市值回报率的波动呈负相关关系，而价格回报率波动呈现负相关。",
