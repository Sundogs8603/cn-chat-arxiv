In this paper, we describe a new detector that: relies on internal feature map of the defended DNN to detect and reverse-engineer the backdoor and identify its target class; can operate post-training (without access to the training dataset); is highly effective for various incorporation mechanisms (i.e., is universal); and which has low computational overhead and so is scalable. Our detection approach is evaluated for different attacks on a benchmark CIFAR-10 image classifier.",
