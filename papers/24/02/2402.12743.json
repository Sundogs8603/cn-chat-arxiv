    "translated_abstract": "威胁行为者归因是对抗高级持久性威胁（APTs）的重要防御策略。网络威胁情报（CTI）在APTs中起着重要作用，涉及对多源异构数据进行分析。当前的归因方法从不同的CTI视角提取特征，并利用机器学习模型根据威胁行为者对CTI报告进行分类。然而，这些方法通常只提取一种特征，并忽略异构信息，尤其是指示器威胁的属性和关系，这构成了CTI的核心。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种基于多模态和多级特征融合（APT-MMF）的APT行为者归因方法。首先，我们利用异构属性图来表征APT报告及其IOCs信息。然后，我们提取并融合多模态特征，包括属性类型特征",
