    "title": "A BiRGAT Model for Multi-intent Spoken Language Understanding with Hierarchical Semantic Frames",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.18258v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Previous work on spoken language understanding (SLU) mainly focuses on single-intent settings, where each input utterance merely contains one user intent. This configuration significantly limits the surface form of user utterances and the capacity of output semantics. In this work, we first propose a Multi-Intent dataset which is collected from a realistic in-Vehicle dialogue System, called MIVS. The target semantic frame is organized in a 3-layer hierarchical structure to tackle the alignment and assignment problems in multi-intent cases. Accordingly, we devise a BiRGAT model to encode the hierarchy of ontology items, the backbone of which is a dual relational graph attention network. Coupled with the 3-way pointer-generator decoder, our method outperforms traditional sequence labeling and classification-based schemes by a large margin.",

    "translated_abstract": "先前对口语理解（SLU）的研究主要集中在单意图设置上，即每个输入话语仅包含一个用户意图。这种配置极大地限制了用户话语的表面形式和输出语义的容量。本文首先提出了一个从实际车载对话系统MIVS中收集的多意图数据集。目标语义框架组织成3层层次结构，以应对多意图情况下的对齐和分配问题。相应地，我们设计了一个BiRGAT模型来编码本体项目的层次结构，其主干是双重关系图注意网络。结合3路指针-生成器解码器，我们的方法在性能上大大优于传统的序列标注和基于分类的方案。",
