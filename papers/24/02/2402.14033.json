    "translated_abstract": "将实体和关系嵌入到连续向量空间中引起了近年来的大量关注。大多数嵌入方法假定所有测试实体在训练期间均可获得，这使得为新出现的实体重新训练嵌入变得耗时。为解决这一问题，最近的研究将图神经网络应用于未知实体的现有邻居。本文提出了一种新颖的框架，即虚拟邻居（VN）网络，以解决三个关键挑战。首先，为了减少邻居稀疏问题，我们引入了通过规则推断得出的虚拟邻居的概念。我们通过解决一个受规则限制的问题为这些邻居分配软标签，而不是简单地将它们视为毫不含糊的真实。其次，许多现有方法仅使用一跳或两跳邻居进行聚合，并忽略可能有用的远距离信息。相反，我们识别了逻辑和...",
