We focus on the use of Haru, a tabletop social robot, and explore the implementation of the Tiny Habits method for fostering positive behavior change. The core of our study lies in developing a fully autonomous dialogue system that maximizes Haru's emotional expressiveness and unique personality. Our methodology involved iterative design and extensive testing of the dialogue system, ensuring it effectively embodied the principles of the Tiny Habits method while also incorporating strategies for trust-raising and trust-dampening. The effectiveness of the final version of the dialogue was evaluated in an experimental study with human participants (N=12). The results indicated a significant improvement in perceptions of Haru's liveliness, interactivity, and neutrality. Additionally, our",

    "translated_abstract": "这项研究探讨了在人机交互中为行为改变辅导设计和影响自主对话的经验调查。我们关注使用桌面社交机器人Haru，并探索实施微习惯方法来促进积极行为改变。我们研究的核心是开发一个完全自主的对话系统，最大限度地发挥Haru的情感表达和独特人格。我们的方法涉及对对话系统的迭代设计和广泛测试，确保它有效地体现了微习惯方法的原则，同时还融合了建立信任和破坏信任的策略。最终版本对话的有效性在人类参与者（N=12）的实验研究中进行了评估。结果显示Haru的生气、互动性和中立性的认知显著提高。",
