    "translated_abstract": "处方避孕药在支持妇女生殖健康方面扮演着关键角色。在美国有将近5000万女性使用避孕药，了解导致避孕药选择和切换的因素非常重要。然而，与药物切换相关的许多因素通常只在无结构的临床记录中得到捕获，并且很难提取。在这里，我们评估了最近开发的大型语言模型GPT-4（通过符合HIPAA的Microsoft Azure API）的零-shot能力，以从UCSF信息共享平台的临床记录数据集中识别避孕药类别切换的原因。我们证明了GPT-4可以准确地提取避孕药切换的原因，相较于基准BERT模型，在避孕药开始和停止提取方面的microF1分数分别为0.849和0.881。对于GPT-4提取的切换原因的人工评估显示出91.4%的准确度，出现幻觉的情况很少。",
