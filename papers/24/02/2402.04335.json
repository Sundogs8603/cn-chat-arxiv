    "abstract": "In this study, we focus on two main tasks, the first for detecting legal violations within unstructured textual data, and the second for associating these violations with potentially affected individuals. We constructed two datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) which were subsequently validated by domain expert annotators. Both tasks were designed specifically for the context of class-action cases. The experimental design incorporated fine-tuning models from the BERT family and open-source LLMs, and conducting few-shot experiments using closed-source LLMs. Our results, with an F1-score of 62.69\\% (violation identification) and 81.02\\% (associating victims), show that our datasets and setups can be used for both tasks. Finally, we publicly release the datasets and the code used for the experiments in order to advance further research in the area of legal natural language processing (NLP).",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项研究中，我们专注于两个主要任务，第一个是检测非结构化文本数据中的法律违规行为，第二个是将这些违规行为与可能受影响的个人关联起来。我们使用大语言模型（LLMs）构建了两个数据集，并由领域专家注释进行验证。两个任务都是为集体诉讼案情境特别设计的。实验设计采用了来自BERT系列和开源LLMs的微调模型，并使用闭源LLMs进行了少样本实验。我们的结果表明，我们的数据集和设置可用于这两个任务，其违规行为识别的F1分数为62.69％，与受害者相关的分数为81.02％。最后，我们公开发布了用于实验的数据集和代码，以推动法律自然语言处理（NLP）领域的进一步研究。",
