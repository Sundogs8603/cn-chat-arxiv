    "translated_abstract": "转移学习已经成为机器学习中的一个关键技术，在各种真实世界应用中表现出高效性。然而，当将这种方法应用于序列流行病学数据时，会面临一个重要挑战，即标注信息匮乏。为了解决这个挑战，我们引入了一种新颖的在线多源转移学习方法，称为预测体积自适应加权（PVAW）。PVAW在整合模型中创造性地实现了动态加权机制，可以根据每个源模型和目标模型的相关性和贡献度自动调整权重。我们通过在匹兹堡大学医学中心收集的多个季节的呼吸道合胞病毒（RSV）数据上应用PVAW，证明了其有效性。我们的方法在模型性能上显著优于现有基线，突出了在线转移学习在处理这一问题上的潜力。",
