    "abstract": "The use of AI analytics in health informatics has seen a rapid growth in recent years. In this talk, we look at AI analytics use in managing chronic health conditions such as diabetes, obesity, etc. We focus on the challenges in managing these conditions especially with drug-free approaches due to the variations in individual circumstances. These variations directed the research into user-centric approach leading to variety of research questions. In this short paper, we give examples from recent and current research work and conclude with what, in our opinion, to be the next steps and some remaining open research questions.",
