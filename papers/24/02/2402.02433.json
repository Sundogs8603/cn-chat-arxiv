    "translated_abstract": "感知者模型对于输入之间的关系没有过多的建模假设，其在内存和计算时间上具有二次可扩展性。事实上，感知者模型在准确度方面超过或与ResNet-50和ViT相竞争。然而，感知者模型没有考虑到预测的不确定性和校准问题。感知者模型在三个数据集、三个模型、一个评估指标和一个超参数设置上都具有一定的泛化性能。最糟糕的是，相对于其他模型，感知者模型的性能改进幅度很小。此外，感知者模型对于架构先验的减少并不实质性，并不能等同于其质量。因此，我发明了五种变体的感知者模型，即不确定性感知者，它们可以获得不确定性估计并在三个指标上进行测量。通过在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上进行实验，不确定性感知者相比感知者模型显著提高了性能。",
