However, current models rely mainly on supervised learning, which is time-consuming and expensive for label collection. To solve this problem, we propose VQScore, a self-supervised metric for evaluating speech based on the quantization error of a vector-quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The training of VQ-VAE relies on clean speech; hence, large quantization errors can be expected when the speech is distorted. To further improve correlation with real quality scores, domain knowledge of speech processing is incorporated into the model design. We found that the vector quantization mechanism could also be used for self-supervised speech enhancement (SE) model training. To improve the robustness of the encoder for SE, a novel self-distillation mechanism combined with adversarial training is introduced. I",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，语音质量评估从人类听觉专家设计转变为机器学习模型。为了解决目前大多数模型依赖于监督学习而导致标签收集耗时昂贵的问题，本文提出了VQScore，一种基于矢量量化可变分编码器（VQ-VAE）的量化误差评估语音的自监督度量。VQ-VAE的训练依赖于清晰语音，因此当语音受到扭曲时可以预期到较大的量化误差。为了进一步提高与真实质量分数的相关性，将语音处理领域知识融入模型设计中。发现矢量量化机制也可以用于自监督语音增强（SE）模型训练。为了提高编码器对SE的鲁棒性，引入了一种新颖的自蒸馏机制结合对抗训练。",
