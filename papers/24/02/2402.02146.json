    "translated_abstract": "在实现有效的紧急响应中，及时获取环境信息、无缝的指挥数据传输和及时的决策至关重要。这需要建立一个弹性的紧急通信专用网络，能够在基础设施缺失的情况下提供通信和感知服务。本文提出了一个具有感知、通信、计算、缓存和智能功能的紧急网络(E-SC3I)。该框架包括紧急计算、缓存、集成通信和感知以及智能增强机制。E-SC3I确保了快速接入大量用户、在不稳定链路上可靠传输数据以及在不断变化的环境中动态网络部署。然而，这些优势带来了重要的计算开销。因此，我们专注于紧急计算，并提出了一种基于自适应协作推理方法(ACIM)。该方法基于Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning and Realization (HRLR)模型，通过在紧急情况下自适应地选择推理节点，实现了协作推理。",
