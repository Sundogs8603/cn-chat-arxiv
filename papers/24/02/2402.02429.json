    "translated_abstract": "离线元强化学习（OMRL）作为离线RL和元RL的结合，在实现RL智能体进行多任务学习和快速适应以及安全获取知识方面表现出巨大的潜力。其中，基于上下文的OMRL（COMRL）作为一种流行的范式，旨在学习一个基于有效任务表示的通用策略。在本文中，通过研究COMRL领域的几个关键里程碑，我们提议将这些看似独立的方法整合到一个统一的信息理论框架中。最重要的是，我们展示了现有的COMRL算法本质上是通过实现各种近似界限来优化任务变量$\\boldsymbol{M}$和其潜在表示$\\boldsymbol{Z}$之间的相互信息目标。基于理论洞察力和信息瓶颈原理，我们提出了一种新算法UNICORN，展现了在广泛的R问题谱上的显著泛化能力。",
