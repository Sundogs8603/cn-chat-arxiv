    "translated_abstract": "近年来，已经开发出在线和离线的深度学习模型用于时间序列预测。然而，离线深度预测模型不能有效适应时间序列数据的变化，而在线深度预测模型常常昂贵且具有复杂的训练过程。在本文中，我们重新定义了在线非线性时间序列预测问题，将其作为线性超维度时间序列预测的问题。非线性低维时间序列数据被映射到高维（超维度）空间进行线性超维度预测，实现了快速、高效和轻量级的在线时间序列预测。我们的框架TSF-HD使用了一种新颖的共训练框架，用于超维度映射和线性超维度预测器，以适应时间序列分布的变化。TSF-HD在短期和长期时间序列预测方面优于现有技术，并降低了推断延迟。我们的代码已经公开发布。",
