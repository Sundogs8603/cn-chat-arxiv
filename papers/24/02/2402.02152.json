    "abstract": "Applied recommender systems research is in a curious position. While there is a very rigorous protocol for measuring performance by A/B testing, best practice for finding a `B' to test does not explicitly target performance but rather targets a proxy measure. The success or failure of a given A/B test then depends entirely on if the proposed proxy is better correlated to performance than the previous proxy. No principle exists to identify if one proxy is better than another offline, leaving the practitioners shooting in the dark. The purpose of this position paper is to question this anti-Utopian thinking and argue that a non-standard use of the deep learning stacks actually has the potential to unlock reward optimizing recommendation.",

    "translated_abstract": "应用推荐系统研究处于一种奇特的境地。尽管在通过A/B测试来衡量性能方面有一个非常严格的协议，但找到要测试的“B”的最佳方法并没有明确地针对性能，而是针对一个代理指标。因此，一个A/B测试的成功或失败完全取决于所提出的代理指标是否与性能相关性更好。没有原则可以在离线情况下确定一个代理指标是否比另一个更好，这使得从业者们摸不着头脑。本论文的目的是质疑这种反乌托邦思维，并主张深度学习堆栈的非标准用法实际上有潜力解锁优化奖励的推荐系统。",
