    "translated_abstract": "尽管近期学术界对于大规模语言模型（LLMs）在理解文本-属性图（TAG）方面的进展和潜力有所披露，但LLMs在实际应用中的部署受到了计算和存储需求高，推理过程中延迟长的限制。同时，传统的图神经网络（GNNs）虽然轻量且擅长学习图的结构特征，但对于真实应用中TAG复杂语义的把握有所限制。为了解决这些限制，我们聚焦于TAG中节点分类的下游任务，提出了一种新颖的图知识蒸馏框架，称为语言图知识蒸馏（LinguGKD），使用LLMs作为教师模型，GNNs作为学生模型进行知识蒸馏。其中包括对LLM进行TAG定向指导调整以应对设计的节点分类提示，然后对层次化学习的节点特征进行对齐。",
