These programs face two important challenges: efficiently allocating limited health resources to large beneficiary populations, and adapting to evolving policy priorities. While prior works in restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB) demonstrated success in public health allocation tasks, they lack flexibility to adapt to evolving policy priorities. Concurrently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as adept, automated planners in various domains, including robotic control and navigation.
