We prove that, if \\r{ho} is monotonic, f can be implemented by a sequential-move game if and only if {\\gamma}^{(\\r{ho},f)} is achievable, which translates a complicated mechanism design problem into checking some conditions defined on primitives.

    "translated_abstract": "传统上，机制设计集中在同时移动博弈上（例如Myerson(1981)）。本文研究具有顺序移动博弈的机制设计，并针对一般解概念（例如完美贝叶斯均衡、显然支配、强显然支配）提供了两个启示原理的结果。首先，如果解概念是可加的，那么在顺序移动博弈中的实施等同于在同时移动博弈中的实施。其次，对于任何解概念ho和任何社会选择函数f，我们确定了一个在基本元素上定义的规范算子γ^(ho,f)。我们证明，如果ho是单调的，f只有当γ^(ho,f)是可实现的时候才能通过顺序移动博弈来实现，这将一个复杂的机制设计问题转化为在基本元素上检查一些条件。现有的大多数解概念要么是可加的，要么是单调的。",
