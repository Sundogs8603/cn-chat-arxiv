    "translated_abstract": "针对自动化高级图像理解的增长需求，特别是在检测图像中的抽象概念（AC）方面，强调了创新和更可解释方法的必要性。这些方法需要将传统的深度视觉方法与人类用于解释图像的微妙、依赖于环境的知识相协调，以便在复杂的语义层面上解释图像。在这项工作中，我们利用文化图像的具有定位感知知识来增强AC图像分类的性能和可解释性。我们自动从图像中提取感知语义单元，然后对其进行建模和整合到ARTstract知识图（AKG）中。该资源捕获了从14,000多个文化图像中获得的具有定位感知语义的知识。此外，我们通过高级语言框架增强了AKG。我们计算知识图嵌入并尝试相对表示和混合方法",
