We used prospectively-collected data from 137 patients referred for chest X-ray at the Christian Medical Center and Hospital (CMCH) in Purnia, Bihar, India. Each patient provided at least five coughs while awaiting radiography. Collected cough sounds were analyzed using acoustic AI methods. Cross-validation was done on temporal and spectral features on the cough sounds of each patient. Features were summarized using standard statistical approaches. Three models were developed, tested and compared in their capacity to predict an abnormal result in the chest X-ray. All three methods yielded models that could discriminate to some extent between normal and abno",

    "translated_abstract": "胸部X射线在急诊、诊断和呼吸系统疾病管理中是常用的工具。在资源受限的环境下，优化这一资源可以为医疗保健系统和患者节省宝贵的费用，同时改善咨询时间。我们使用印度比哈尔邦普尔尼亚基督医学中心和医院（CMCH）的137名患者的前瞻性收集的数据。每个患者在等待进行放射照相时提供了至少五个咳嗽声。我们使用声学人工智能方法分析了收集到的咳嗽声音。对每个患者的咳嗽声音进行了时间和频谱特征的交叉验证。使用标准统计方法对特征进行了总结。我们开发、测试和比较了三种模型，以预测胸部X射线的异常结果。这三种方法均能在一定程度上区分正常和异常结果。",
