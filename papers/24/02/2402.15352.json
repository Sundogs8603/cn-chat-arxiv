In this paper, we propose a survey of guided tour of supervised and unsupervised learning methods for image denoising, classifying the main principles elaborated during this evolution, with a particular concern given to recent developments in supervised learning.

We give insights on the rationales and limitations of the most performant methods in the literature, and we highlight the common features between many of them.

    "translated_abstract": "图像去噪可能是图像处理中最古老且仍然是最活跃的研究课题之一。在过去几十年中引入了许多方法论概念，并随着卷积神经网络和监督深度学习的出现在近年来显著提高了性能。本文提出了对图像去噪的监督和无监督学习方法进行全面调查，对此演变过程中阐明的主要原则进行分类，特别关注监督学习的最新发展。它被构想为一个以当前方法为框架的教程，提供对文献中最有效方法的原理和局限性的见解，突出了许多方法之间的共同特征。最后，我们重点关注了归一化等变性质，这一性质令人惊讶地并没有得到保证。",
