Using a grid navigation paradigm, we tested whether contextual cues implemented as different \"grid worlds\", allow participants to learn two distinct key-mappings more efficiently. Our results indicate that when contextual information is provided, task performance is significantly better. The same held true for meta-reinforcement learning agents that differed in whether or not they receive contextual information when performing the task. We evaluated their accuracy in predicting human performance in the task and analyzed their internal representations. The results indicate that contextual cues allow the formation of separate representations in space and time when using different visuomotor mappings, whereas the absence of them favors sharing one representation. While both strategies can allow learning of multiple visuomotor mappings, we showed contextual cues provide a computational advantage ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了人类获得全新技能的多个视觉运动映射的能力。使用格子导航范式，我们测试了不同\"格子世界\"实施的情境线索是否能够使参与者更有效地学习两个不同的关键映射。我们的结果表明，当提供情境信息时，任务表现显著更好。对于元强化学习智能体来说也是如此，它们在执行任务时是否接收情境信息有所不同。我们评估了它们在预测任务中人类表现的准确性，并分析了它们的内部表示。结果表明，情境线索允许在使用不同的视觉运动映射时形成独立的空间和时间表示，而它们的缺失则更倾向于共享一个表示。虽然这两种策略都可以学习多个视觉运动映射，但我们证明了情境线索提供了计算上的优势。",
