    "translated_abstract": "时间序列预测是许多业务问题中最基本且最普遍的任务之一，包括需求预测和物流优化。然而，传统的时间序列预测方法由于在保持高准确性的同时难以扩展其模型大小，导致其模型规模较小且表现力有限。在本文中，我们提出了Forecasting orchestra (Forchestra)，这是一个简单但功能强大的框架，能够准确预测各种物品的未来需求。我们从经验上证明，模型规模可扩展至高达0.8亿个参数。所提出的方法不仅明显优于现有的预测模型，而且在零样本方式评估下游数据集时也能很好地泛化到未见数据点。最后，我们进行了广泛的定性和定量研究，以分析所提出的模型",
