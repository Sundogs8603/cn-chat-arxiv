    "translated_abstract": "在医疗文档的快速发展环境中，准确转录临床对话变得日益重要。这项研究探索了利用大型语言模型（LLMs）提高医学转录中自动语音识别（ASR）系统准确性的潜力。利用PriMock57数据集，该数据集包含了各种不同的初级护理咨询，我们采用先进的LLMs来优化ASR生成的转录。我们的研究是多方面的，关注于改进一般的词错误率（WER），医学概念错误率（MC-WER）以准确转录重要的医学术语，以及说话人重音划分准确性。此外，我们还评估了LLM后处理在改进语义文本相似性方面的作用，从而保持临床对话的上下文完整性。通过一系列实验证明，我们比较了零-shot和Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示技术在提高重音划分和纠正准确性方面的效果。",
