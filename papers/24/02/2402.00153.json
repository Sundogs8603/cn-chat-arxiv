    "translated_abstract": "高质量的数据是任何工程应用的关键要求之一。在地震工程实践中，准确的数据对于预测结构响应或在结构健康监测（SHM）应用中进行损伤检测过程至关重要且不确定性较小。然而，获取高分辨率数据面临诸多挑战，如昂贵的成本、庞大的数据通道和巨大的存储需求。为了应对这些挑战，本研究采用超分辨率生成对抗网络（SRGANs）改善时间历史数据的分辨率，例如SHM应用中传感器网络获取的数据，这是首次在地震工程领域应用SRGANs。时间序列数据被转换为RGB值，将原始数据转换为图像。然后使用SRGANs来提升这些低分辨率图像，从而增强整体传感器分辨率。这种方法不仅有潜力减少数据通道数量，还可以提高地震数据采样频率，从而增加地震工程应用的准确性和可靠性。",
