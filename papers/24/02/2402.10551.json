    "translated_abstract": "癌症因其不断增长的临床和经济负担而仍然是全球性挑战。其独特的个性化表现使治疗变得困难，推动了个性化治疗策略的追求。因此，基因组学分析越来越成为临床诊断面板的一部分。有效利用这些面板需要准确的药物反应预测（DRP）模型，而由于有限的标记患者数据，建立这样的模型是具有挑战性的。以往解决这一问题的方法已经使用了各种形式的迁移学习。然而，它们并没有明确建模这些诊断面板中变异列表的可变长度的顺序结构。此外，它们也没有利用辅助信息（如患者生存）进行模型训练。我们通过一种新颖的基于变压器的方法来解决这些局限性，该方法在基准数据上超越了最先进的DRP模型的性能。我们还提出了一种设计...",
