    "abstract": "Trajectory data combines the complexities of time series, spatial data, and (sometimes irrational) movement behavior.

This review paper provides the first comprehensive overview of deep learning approaches for trajectory data. We have identified eight specific mobility use cases which we analyze with regards to the deep learning models and the training data used. Besides a comprehensive quantitative review of the literature since 2018, the main contribution of our work is the data-centric analysis of recent work in this field, placing it along the mobility data continuum which ranges from detailed dense trajectories of individual movers (quasi-continuous tracking data), to sparse trajectories (such as check-in data), and aggregated trajectories (crowd information).",

    "translated_abstract": "轨迹数据结合了时间序列、空间数据和（有时是非理性的）运动行为的复杂性。随着数据可用性和计算能力的增加，深度学习从轨迹数据中变得越来越流行。本综述论文为轨迹数据的深度学习方法提供了首个全面的概述。我们识别了八个具体的移动性用例，根据使用的深度学习模型和训练数据进行了分析。除了对2018年以来文献的全面定量审查外，我们工作的主要贡献是对该领域最新工作的以数据为中心的分析，将其置于移动性数据连续性的范畴中，从详细的个体移动者密集轨迹（准连续追踪数据）到稀疏轨迹（如签到数据）和聚合轨迹（人群信息）。",
