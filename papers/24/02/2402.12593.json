Towards this end, we introduce Standardize, a retrieval-style in-context learning-based framework to guide large language models to align with expert-defined standards. Focusing on English language standards in the education domain as a use case, we consider the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and Common Core Standards (CCS) for the task of open-ended content generation. Our findings show that models can gain 40% to 100% increase in precise accuracy for Llama2 and GPT-4, respectively, demonstrating that the use of knowledge artifacts extracted from standards and integrating them in the gener",

    "translated_abstract": "在工程、医疗保健和教育领域，领域专家遵循严格的标准来制作质量内容，如技术手册、药物说明和儿童读物。然而，当前在可控文本生成方面的研究尚未探讨使用这些标准作为控制的参考。为此，我们引入了一种名为Standardize的检索式上下文学习框架，以指导大型语言模型与专家定义的标准对齐。以英语语言标准在教育领域作为一个使用案例，我们考虑了欧洲共同语言参考框架（CEFR）和通用核心标准（CCS）用于开放性内容生成任务。我们的研究结果表明，模型的精确性对于Llama2和GPT-4分别可以提高40%到100%，证明了从标准中提取知识工件并将其整合到生成中的可行性。",
