Our analysis shows that against two popularly employed MAB algorithms, UCB1 and $\\epsilon$-greedy, the success of a stealthy attack depends on the environmental conditions and the realized reward of the arm pulled in the first round.

    "translated_abstract": "针对随机多臂老虎机（MAB）算法的对手性攻击在文献中得到了广泛研究。本文聚焦在奖励投毒攻击，并发现大多数现有攻击可以被我们提出的基于均匀性检测的检测方法轻易发现，因为它们在奖励操纵方面的攻击性较强。这激励我们研究针对随机MAB的隐身攻击概念，并调查由此产生的攻击性。我们的分析表明，针对两种常用的MAB算法UCB1和$\\epsilon$-greedy，隐身攻击的成功取决于环境条件和第一轮拉动臂数的实现奖励。我们还分析了一般MAB算法配备我们的攻击检测方法的情况，发现几乎总是能够进行一次成功的隐身攻击。这为MAB的安全风险带来新的见解。",
