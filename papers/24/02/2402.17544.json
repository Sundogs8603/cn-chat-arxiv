To improve the performance of LICs for screen content (SC) images without breaking backwards compatibility, we propose to introduce parameterized and invertible linear transformations into the coding pipeline without changing the underlying baseline codec's operation flow. We design two neural networks to act as prefilters and postfilters in our setup to increase the coding efficiency and help with the recovery from coding artifacts. Our end-to-end trained solution achieves up to 10% bitrate savings on SC compression compared to the baseline LICs while introducing only 1% extra parameters.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着学习的图像编解码器（LICs）变得越来越普遍，它们对于超出分布数据的低编码效率成为某些应用的瓶颈。为了提高LICs在屏幕内容（SC）图像上的性能，同时又不破坏向后兼容性，我们提出引入参数化和可逆线性变换到编码管线中，而不改变基线编解码器的操作流。我们设计了两个神经网络作为我们设置中的前置滤波器和后置滤波器，以增加编码效率并帮助恢复编码伪影。我们的端到端训练解决方案在SC压缩上相比基线LICs实现高达10%的比特率节省，同时只引入1%的额外参数。",
