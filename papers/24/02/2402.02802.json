We conclude our analysis resorting to Eurostat's Household Budget Survey from where we illustrate the different redistribution patterns accounting for needs across European countries.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们采用公理化方法研究当代理人报告收入和需求时的再分配问题。我们形式化了反映伦理和运营原则的公理，如可加性、公正和个体合理性。这些公理的不同组合表征了三种焦点规则（自由放任、完全再分配和需要调整的完全再分配），以及它们之间的妥协。我们还通过探讨Lorenz占优准则和多数投票揭示了妥协的结构。我们的分析为线性所得税制度提供了公理化的理论依据。最后，我们借助来自欧洲国家的Eurostat家庭预算调查来说明考虑需求的不同再分配模式。",
