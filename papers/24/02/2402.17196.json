    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的深度学习框架，名为SYMHnet，它采用图神经网络和双向长短时记忆网络，合作学习来自太阳风和行星间磁场参数的模式，用于基于1分钟和5分钟分辨率数据的SYM-H指数的短期预测。SYMHnet将NASA太空科学数据协调存档提供的参数值的时间序列作为输入，并预测在给定时间点t时，时间点t + w小时的SYM-H指数值，其中w为1或2。通过将贝叶斯推断纳入学习框架，SYMHnet在预测未来SYM-H指数时可以量化数据不确定性和模型不确定性。实验结果表明，SYMHnet在平静时期和风暴时期，无论是1分钟还是5分钟分辨率数据上表现良好。结果还表明，SYMHnet通常表现出色",
