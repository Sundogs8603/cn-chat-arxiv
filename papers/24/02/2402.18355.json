    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.18355v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Modern, large scale monitoring systems have to process and store vast amounts of log data in near real-time. At query time the systems have to find relevant logs based on the content of the log message using support structures that can scale to these amounts of data while still being efficient to use. We present our novel DynaWarp membership sketch, capable of answering Multi-Set Multi-Membership-Queries, that can be used as an alternative to existing indexing structures for streamed log data. In our experiments, DynaWarp required up to 93% less storage space than the tested state-of-the-art inverted index and had up to four orders of magnitude less false-positives than the tested state-of-the-art membership sketch. Additionally, DynaWarp achieved up to 250 times higher query throughput than the tested inverted index and up to 240 times higher query throughput than the tested membership sketch.",

    "translated_abstract": "现代大规模监控系统必须实时处理和存储大量日志数据。在查询时，系统必须基于日志消息的内容找到相关日志，使用能够扩展到这些数据量并且仍然高效的支持结构。我们提出了一种新颖的DynaWarp成员草图，能够回答多集多成员查询，可作为流式日志数据的现有索引结构的替代方案。在我们的实验中，DynaWarp所需的存储空间比测试的最先进的倒排索引少了高达93％，误报率比测试的最先进的成员草图少了高达四个数量级。此外，DynaWarp的查询吞吐量比测试的倒排索引高出高达250倍，并且比测试的成员草图高出高达240倍。",
