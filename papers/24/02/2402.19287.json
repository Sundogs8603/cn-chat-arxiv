    "translated_abstract": "数据增强是一个研究领域，在许多机器学习领域中都得到了积极的发展，比如基于图像的学习模型、用于自动驾驶车辆的强化学习以及对点云数据进行通用的噪声注入。然而，对于一般的时间序列数据增强，仍然有很多问题有待解决，尤其是因为为这些模型开发的方法并不容易跨越。关于时间序列数据增强的三种常见方法包括：(i) 构建基于物理的模型，然后在系数空间中赋予不确定性（例如），(ii) 向观察到的数据集添加噪声，以及(iii) 从中可以训练出稳健生成神经网络模型的大量时间序列数据集。然而，对于在工业中处理时间序列数据的许多实际问题：(i) 通常并没有一个稳健的物理模型可供使用，(ii)...",
