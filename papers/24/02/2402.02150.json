Accurately forecasting the extent of earthquake damage and assessing potential risks can be instrumental in saving numerous lives. In this study, we developed linear regression models capable of predicting seismic intensity distributions based on earthquake parameters: location, depth, and magnitude. Because it is completely data-driven, it can predict intensity distributions without geographical information. The dataset comprises seismic intensity data from earthquakes that occurred in the vicinity of Japan between 1997 and 2020, specifically containing 1,857 instances of earthquakes with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater, sourced from the Japan Meteorological Agency. We trained both regression and classification models and combined them to take advantage of both to create a hybrid model. The proposed model outperformed commonly used Ground Motion Prediction Equations (GMPEs) in terms of the correlatio",

    "translated_abstract": "地震是人类面临的最紧迫和致命的自然灾害之一。准确预测地震损害的程度和评估潜在风险可以在挽救众多生命方面起到重要作用。在本研究中，我们开发了基于地震参数（位置、深度和震级）的线性回归模型，能够预测地震强度分布。由于它完全基于数据驱动，可以在没有地理信息的情况下预测强度分布。数据集包含1997年至2020年在日本附近发生的地震的地震强度数据，具体包含1857个震级在5.0或更大的地震实例，数据来源于日本气象厅。我们训练了回归模型和分类模型，并将它们结合起来利用二者的优势创建了一个混合模型。在相关性方面，所提出的模型优于常用的地震地面运动预测方程（Ground Motion Prediction Equations，GMPEs）。",
