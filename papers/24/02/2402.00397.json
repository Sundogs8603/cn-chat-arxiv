    "translated_abstract": "交通预测对智能交通系统具有重要意义，可以帮助高效分配资源和有效控制交通。然而，其有效性往往严重依赖于丰富的交通数据，而许多城市由于设备支持有限而缺乏足够的数据，这对交通预测构成了重大挑战。鉴于这一挑战，我们做出了一个显著的观察：交通模式在不同城市之间存在相似性。基于这一关键洞察，我们提出了一种解决跨城市少样本交通预测问题的方法，称为多尺度交通模式库（MTPB）。主要上，MTPB通过利用数据丰富的源城市启动其学习过程，通过空间-时间感知的预训练过程有效获取全面的交通知识。随后，该框架采用先进的聚类技术从学习到的知识中系统生成一个多尺度交通模式库。接下来，该框架使用准确的交通模式检索机制进行跨城市的少样本交通预测。",
