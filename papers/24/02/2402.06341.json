    "translated_abstract": "通用型大型语言模型（LLMs），如GPT-4，在包括医学诊断在内的各个领域显示出了相当大的潜力。罕见病，影响全球约3亿人，往往由于缺乏经验丰富的医生和难以区分众多罕见病的复杂性而导致临床诊断率不尽人意。在这种情况下，最近的新闻如\"ChatGPT在17名医生失败后正确诊断出了一位4岁孩子的罕见病\"强调了LLMs在临床诊断罕见病中的潜力，然而这个角色在研究中尚未得到充分探讨。为了填补这一研究空白，我们推出了RareBench，一个开创性的基准测试，旨在系统评估LLMs在罕见病领域内的4个关键维度上的能力。同时，我们编制了最大的罕见病患者开放数据集，为未来研究在这一领域建立了一个基准。为了促进罕见病的差异诊断，我们开发了一个动态的方法。",
