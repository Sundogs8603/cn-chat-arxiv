Validation is one of the key communication techniques in psychology, which entails recognizing, understanding, and acknowledging others' emotional states, thoughts, and actions. This study introduces the first framework designed to engender empathetic dialogue with validating responses. Our approach incorporates a tripartite module system: 1) validation timing detection, 2) users' emotional state identification, and 3) validating response generation. Utilizing Japanese EmpatheticDialogues dataset - a textual-based dialogue dataset consisting of 8 emotional categories from Plutchik's wheel of emotions - the Task Adaptive Pre-Training (TAPT) BERT-based model outperforms both random baseline and the ChatGPT performance, in term of F1-score, in all modules. Further validation of our model's efficacy is confirmed in its application to the TUT Emotional S",

    "translated_abstract": "在人机对话领域中，促进共情回应至关重要。认可是心理学中的关键沟通技巧之一，涉及识别、理解和承认他人的情绪状态、思想和行为。本研究介绍了第一个旨在促进共情对话的框架，其中包括三部分模块系统：1)验证时机检测，2)用户情绪状态识别，3)验证响应生成。利用日本EmpatheticDialogues数据集，该数据集是一个基于文本的对话数据集，包括从Plutchik情感轮中选取的8个情绪类别，任务自适应预训练（TAPT）基于BERT的模型在所有模块的F1分数方面均优于随机基准线和ChatGPT性能。",
