Conventional machine learning methods assume that each sleep study is associated with a fixed set of observed modalities and that all modalities are available for each sample. However, noisy and missing modalities are a common issue in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we propose a comprehensive pipeline aiming to compensate for the missing or noisy modalities when performing sleep apnea detection. Unlike other existing studies, our proposed model works with any combination of available modalities. Our experiments show that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in sleep apnea detection using various subsets of available data and different levels of noise, and maintains its high performance (AUROC>0.9) even in the presence",

    "translated_abstract": "多导睡眠图（PSG）是一种记录多模式生理信号的睡眠研究类型，广泛用于睡眠分期和呼吸事件检测等目的。传统机器学习方法假设每个睡眠研究与一组固定的观察模态相关联，并且每个样本都有所有模态可用。然而，在真实世界的临床环境中，噪声和缺失模态是一个常见问题。在本研究中，我们提出了一个全面的流程，旨在在执行睡眠呼吸暂停检测时弥补缺失或噪声模态。与其他现有研究不同，我们提出的模型可以与任何可用模态组合一起使用。我们的实验证明，所提出的模型在使用各种可用数据子集和不同噪声水平进行睡眠呼吸暂停检测时优于其他最先进方法，并且即使在存在情况下也能保持高性能（AUROC>0.9）",
