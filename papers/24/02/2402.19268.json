We demonstrate that the limiting distribution of the unconditional intermediate order quantiles in the tails converges to a Gaussian distribution. This is remarkable as two-way cluster dependence entails potential non-Gaussianity in general, but extremal quantiles do not suffer from this issue. Building upon this result, we extend our analysis to extremal quantile regressions of intermediate order.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了两向集群依赖下的极值分位数。我们展示了尾部无条件中间级别分位数的极限分布收敛于高斯分布。这一点非常重要，因为通常情况下，两向集群依赖涉及潜在的非高斯性，但极值分位数不会受到此问题的影响。基于这一结果，我们将分析扩展到中间级别的极值分位数回归。",
