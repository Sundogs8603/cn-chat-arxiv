    "abstract": "This paper explores the area of news recommendation, a key component of online information sharing. Initially, we provide a clear introduction to news recommendation, defining the core problem and summarizing current methods and notable recent algorithms. We then present our work on implementing the NRAM (News Recommendation with Attention Mechanism), an attention-based approach for news recommendation, and assess its effectiveness. Our evaluation shows that NRAM has the potential to significantly improve how news content is personalized for users on digital news platforms.",
