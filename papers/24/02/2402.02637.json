    "translated_abstract": "机器学习与数学的几个领域（如统计学、概率论和线性代数）有着长期的合作传统。我们提出了机器学习研究的一个新方向：$C^*$-代数机器学习，这是$C^*$-代数和机器学习之间的交流和相互滋养。$C^*$-代数是复数空间的自然推广的数学概念，它使我们能够统一现有的学习策略，并构建一个更多元化和信息丰富的数据模型的新框架。我们解释了在机器学习中使用$C^*$-代数的原因和方法，并提供了在核方法和神经网络背景下设计$C^*$-代数学习模型的技术考虑。此外，我们讨论了$C^*$-代数机器学习中的开放问题和挑战，并提出了我们对未来发展和应用的思考。",
