The success of these projects depends on integrating new technologies and understanding the needs of digitally literate students. The \"learning by doing\" approach suggests that real success in learning new skills is achieved when students can try out and practise these skills. In this article, we demonstrate how Large Language Models (LLMs) can enhance the quality of teaching by using ChatGPT in a role-playing simulation game scenario to promote active learning. Moreover, we discuss how LLMs can boost students' interest in learning by allowing them to practice real-life scenarios using ChatGPT.",
