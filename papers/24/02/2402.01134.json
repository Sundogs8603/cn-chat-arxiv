    "translated_abstract": "自动航空三角测量（AAT）旨在同时恢复图像姿态和重建稀疏点，对地球观测至关重要。凭借其在摄影测量领域数十年的研究积淀，AAT已经发展成为大规模无人机地图制作中广泛应用的基本过程。然而，传统的AAT方法仍面临效率低和稳健性有限等挑战。本文介绍了DeepAAT，这是一个专门为无人机影像AAT设计的深度学习网络。DeepAAT考虑了影像的空间和光谱特征，增强了解决错误匹配对和准确预测图像姿态的能力。DeepAAT在AAT的效率方面取得了重大突破，确保了场景的全面覆盖和精度。其处理速度比增量AAT方法快几百倍，比全局AAT方法快几十倍，同时保持可比的重建水平。",
