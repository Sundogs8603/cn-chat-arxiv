    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习模型的取证调查中，确定模型的数据领域的技术起着至关重要的作用，之前的工作依赖于大规模的语料库，如ImageNet来近似目标模型的领域。虽然这些方法在找到广泛的领域方面是有效的，但它们在识别领域内更具细粒度的类别时常常遇到困难。在本文中，我们介绍了一种增强的方法，不仅确定通用的数据领域（例如人脸），而且确定了其具体的属性（例如佩戴眼镜）。我们的方法使用图像嵌入模型作为编码器，生成模型作为解码器。从粗略的描述开始，解码器生成一组图像，然后将其呈现给未知的目标模型。模型成功分类将引导编码器修正描述，然后用于生成下一次迭代中更具体的图像集合。这种迭代的改进缩小了领域的范围。",
