    "translated_abstract": "动态套期保值是定期进行金融工具交易，以抵消投资或负债所带来风险的实践。动态套期保值优化可以被视为一个顺序决策问题；因此，最近提出了利用强化学习（RL）模型来解决这一任务。然而，现有的套期保值RL工作并未考虑由交易工具的有限流动性引起的市场影响。整合这样的特征对于在具有有限流动性的股票期权套期保值时实现最佳性能可能是至关重要的。本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的新型通用市场影响动态套期保值模型，考虑了几个逼真的特征，例如凸市场影响和随时间持续的影响。从DRL模型得到的最优策略通过几个期权套期保值模拟进行了分析，并与常用程序（如德尔塔套期保值）进行了比较。",
