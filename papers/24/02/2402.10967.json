The consumption of alcohol in adolescents is known to be influenced by seeing friends and even parents drinking alcohol. Building on this fact, a number of studies into alcohol consumption among adolescents have made use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques to study the different social networks (peers, friends, family, etc.) with whom the adolescent is involved. These kinds of studies need an initial phase of data gathering by means of questionnaires and a subsequent analysis phase using the SNA techniques.

    "translated_abstract": "酒精使用障碍(AUD)是全球公共卫生组织特别关注的问题，尤其是涉及青少年群体。青少年饮酒行为受到朋友甚至父母饮酒的影响。许多研究利用社交网络分析(SNA)技术研究青少年涉及的不同社交网络(同龄人、朋友、家人等)。这类研究需要通过问卷调查进行数据收集，然后利用SNA技术进行后续分析。这一过程涉及多个手动数据处理阶段，耗时且容易出错。利用知识工程技术(包括构建领域本体论)来表示信息，可以实现从初始数据收集到分析阶段的所有活动自动化。",
