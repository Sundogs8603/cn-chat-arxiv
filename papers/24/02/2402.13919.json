    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）如GPT和Llama在摘要任务上取得了重大进展，但在事实不准确方面存在困难，这是临床NLP应用中的关键问题，错误可能导致严重后果。为了解决事实对齐的专家注释数据成本高昂且有限的问题，本研究引入了一种创新的流程，利用GPT-3.5和GPT-4生成高质量反馈，旨在增强临床笔记摘要中的事实一致性。我们的研究主要关注编辑反馈，在没有额外注释的情况下，模拟了医疗专业人员改善AI系统输出的实际场景。尽管GPT在各种临床NLP任务中都表现出了专业水平，比如医学执照考试，但对其提供改善较弱LM或LLM生成质量的专业级编辑反馈的研究很少。",
