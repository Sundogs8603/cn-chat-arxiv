    "translated_abstract": "机器人技术的一个挑战是使机器人具备足够强大的推理能力，能够在动态环境中执行复杂任务。最近的LLM进展将它们定位为简单推理任务的首选工具，激发了Liang等人的开创性工作[35]，该工作使用LLM将自然语言命令转化为机器人单位的低级静态执行计划。在机器人系统中使用LLM将其泛化能力提升到一个新的水平，实现了对新任务的零样本泛化。本文将这项先前工作扩展到了动态环境。我们提出了InCoRo，一个使用经典的机器人反馈循环的系统，由LLM控制器、场景理解单元和机器人组成。我们的系统持续分析环境状态并提供适应性执行命令，使机器人能够适应不断变化的环境条件并纠正控制器错误。我们的系统不需要任何迭代设计。",
