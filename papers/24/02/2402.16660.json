Most of the existing outfit recommendation systems focus on pairwise item compatibility prediction (using visual and text features) to score an outfit combination having several items, followed by recommendation of top-n outfits or a capsule wardrobe having a collection of outfits based on user's fashion taste. However, none of these consider user's preference of price-range for individual clothing types or an overall shopping budget for a set of items. In this paper, we propose a box recommendation framework - BOXREC - which at first, collects user preferences across different item types (namely, top-wear, bottom-wear and foot-wear) including price-range of each type and a maximum shopping budget for a particular shopping session. It then generates a set of preferred outfits by retrieving all types of preferred items from the",

    "translated_abstract": "在过去几年里，服装搭配的自动化引起了研究界的极大关注。大多数现有的服装推荐系统侧重于预测两两物品的兼容性（使用视觉和文本特征）来评分一个包含多件物品的服装组合，然后推荐前n套服装或一套基于用户时尚品味的服装胶囊。然而，这些系统都没有考虑用户对单个服装类型的价格范围偏好或一组物品的整体购物预算。在本文中，我们提出了一个盒子推荐框架 - BOXREC - 首先收集用户在不同物品类型（即上装、下装和鞋类）上的偏好，包括每种类型的价格范围和特定购物会话的最大购物预算。然后通过从所有类型的偏好物品中检索，生成一组喜好的服装。",
