While efforts to automatically detect propaganda techniques in textual, visual, or multimodal content have increased, most of them primarily focus on English content. The majority of the recent initiatives targeting medium to low-resource languages produced relatively small annotated datasets, with a skewed distribution, posing challenges for the development of sophisticated propaganda detection models. To address this challenge, we carefully develop the largest propaganda dataset to date, ArPro, comprised of 8K paragraphs from newspaper articles, labeled at the text span level following a taxonomy of 23 propagandistic techniques.

    "translated_abstract": "在主流媒体和社交媒体上的宣传使用激增，旨在操纵或误导用户。尽管自动检测文本、视觉或多模态内容中的宣传技术的努力增加，但其中大部分主要集中在英文内容上。最近大部分针对中低资源语言的举措产生了相对较小的标记数据集，分布不均，给精致宣传检测模型的开发带来挑战。为解决这一挑战，我们精心开发了迄今为止最大的宣传数据集ArPro，包括来自报纸文章的8K段落，在23种宣传技术的分类法下进行文本段标记。此外，我们的工作首次尝试了使用GPT-4进行从文本中精细宣传检测的大型语言模型（LLM）性能。结果表明，GPT-4的表现",
