    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在许多自然语言处理（NLP）任务上取得成功，但仍然难以有效利用知识进行知识密集型任务，表现出生成不完整、非事实性或不合逻辑的答案等限制。这些限制源于LLMs在普通微调期间对知识的认识不足。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种知识感知微调（KnowTuning）方法，以明确和隐式地改善LLMs的知识认识。我们设计了一个显式知识感知生成阶段，训练LLMs明确识别答案中的知识三元组。我们还提出了一个隐式知识感知比较阶段，训练LLMs隐式区分可靠和不可靠的知识，包括完整性、事实性和逻辑性三个方面。对通用和医学问答（QA）数据集进行的大量实验证实了效果。",
