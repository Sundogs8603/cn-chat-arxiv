    "translated_abstract": "成像质谱细胞术是一种相对新的在亚细胞分辨率下成像生物组织的技术。近年来，基于学习的分割方法使得对细胞类型和形态的精确量化成为可能，但通常依赖于具有完全注释的大型数据集。本文研究了不完美标签对基于学习的分割模型的影响，并评估了这些模型对不同组织类型的泛化能力。我们的结果表明，从完全注释的标签掩模中删除50%的细胞注释仅将Dice相似性系数（DSC）评分降低到0.874（与完全注释GT掩模上训练的模型的0.889相比）。这意味着注释时间实际上可以减少至少一半而不会对性能产生不利影响。此外，将我们的单组织模型训练于不完美的标签上仅将DSC降低了0.031，与其多组织模型相比，在未知组织类型上几乎没有质量损失。",

Additionally, the performance of a single-tissue model on unseen tissue types is comparable to that of a multi-tissue model."
