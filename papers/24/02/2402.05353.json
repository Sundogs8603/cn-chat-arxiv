    "translated_abstract": "在联邦学习 (FL) 不断发展的环境中，由于客户端数据的分散和多样性，处理标签噪音带来了独特的挑战。传统的集中式学习方法在FL中受到隐私问题和客户端数据的异质性的限制，无法有效缓解标签噪音。本文重新审视了早期学习正则化，引入了一种创新的策略，即联邦标签混合正则化（FLR）。FLR通过生成新的伪标签，将局部和全局模型预测相结合，灵活适应FL的复杂性。该方法不仅提高了全局模型在i.i.d.和非i.i.d.设置下的准确性，还有效地抵抗了噪音标签的记忆化。FLR与现有的标签噪音和FL技术相兼容，为在充满标签不准确性的FL环境中改善泛化能力铺平了道路。",
