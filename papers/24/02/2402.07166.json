We note here that just as this emergence of AI seems to occur at a threshold point in the number of neural connections or weights, it has also been observed that human brain and especially the cortex region is nothing special or extraordinary but simply a case of scaled-up version of the primate brain and that even the human intelligence seems like an emergent phenomena of scale.",
