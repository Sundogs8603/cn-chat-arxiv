    "translated_abstract": "随着复杂网络设备的兴起，网络取证（CF）面临着许多新的挑战。例如，智能手机上运行着数十个系统，每个系统拥有上百万个可下载的应用程序。在这么庞大的数据中进行筛查并理解需要新的技术，例如来自人工智能领域的技术。要成功将这些技术应用于网络取证中，我们需要向网络取证的利益相关者（如取证分析师和法院成员）证明和解释结果，以便他们做出明智的决策。如果我们想成功地将人工智能应用于网络取证中，就需要对人工智能系统建立信任。接受在网络取证中使用人工智能的一些因素是使人工智能真实、可解释、可理解和交互。这样，人工智能系统将更容易被公众接受，并确保与法律标准保持一致。一个可解释的人工智能（XAI）系统可以在网络取证中担当这个角色，我们将这样的系统称为XAI-CF。",
