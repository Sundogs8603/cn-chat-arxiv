    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种针对高海拔环境（空中吊索道）中的钢丝绳非破坏性损伤检测的新算法。该算法包括两个关键组件：首先，设计了一种名为RGBD-UNet的分割模型，可以准确地从复杂背景中提取钢丝绳。该模型通过提出的CMA模块可以处理和结合颜色和深度信息。其次，开发了一种名为VovNetV3.5的检测模型，用于区分正常和异常的钢丝绳。它将VovNet架构与DBB模块结合起来以提高性能。此外，还提出了一种新颖的背景增强方法，以增强分割模型的泛化能力。创建了包含不同场景中钢丝绳图像的数据集，用于分割和检测模型的训练和测试。实验证明，在基准模型上取得了显著的改进。在提出的数据集上，基于此算法的传感器识别性能（h）明显提高。",
