    "translated_abstract": "小型自主无人驾驶飞行器（UAVs）因其小巧的尺寸越来越受欢迎，能够执行诸如室内导航或人员监控等新任务。然而，它们的尺寸和简单的电子设备在实现先进的机载智能方面提出了严峻挑战。本文提出了一种新的用于利用深度神经网络（DNNs）进行视觉姿态估计任务的自动优化流水线。该流水线利用两种不同的神经架构搜索（NAS）算法，以在DNN结构空间中进行广泛的基于复杂性的探索。然后，获得的网络部署在一款配备并行超低功耗SoC的现成纳米无人机上，利用一组用于高效执行关键DNN层序列的新型软件内核。我们的结果改进了最新技术，将推断延迟在等误差情况下缩短了最多3.22倍。",
