    "translated_abstract": "精确预测热带气旋（TC）强度对于制定灾害风险减少策略至关重要。目前的方法主要依赖于来自ERA5数据的有限时空信息，并忽视这些物理变量之间的因果关系，未能充分捕捉强度预测所需的空间和时间模式。为解决这一问题，作者提出了一种多模态多尺度因果自回归模型（MSCAR），这是第一个将因果关系与大规模多模态数据结合起来进行全球TC强度自回归预测的模型。此外，鉴于目前缺乏一个提供广泛空间变量的TC数据集，我们推出了基于卫星和ERA5的热带气旋数据集（SETCD），它是与TC有关的最长和最全面的全球数据集。对该数据集的实验表明MSCAR胜过了现有的最先进方法。",
