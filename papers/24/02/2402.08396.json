    "abstract": "This paper examines the interdependence of international success and competitive balance of domestic sports competitions. More specifically, we apply the notion of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index to examine the effect of international rewards on distortion of competitive balance in domestic competitions and derive conditions under which the level of domestic competitive balance raises or falls. Our results yield interesting policy implications for the regulation of prize schemes in international competitions.",
