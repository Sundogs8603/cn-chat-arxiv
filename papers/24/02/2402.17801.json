    "translated_abstract": "生成人工智能的快速发展即将颠覆创意产业。在对这项新技术的巨大兴奋中，其在创意产业中的未来发展和应用至关重要的两个版权问题是：1) 补偿那些用于训练生成人工智能模型的创作者（公平使用标准）；和2) AI生成的内容是否有资格获得版权保护（AI-版权性）。虽然这两个问题引发了学术界和实践者之间激烈的争论，但大多数分析都集中在它们对现有版权原则所带来的挑战上。在本文中，我们旨在更好地理解这两个监管问题及其互动对经济的影响。通过建立一个具有内生内容创作和AI模型发展的动态模型，我们揭示了公平使用标准和AI-版权性对AI发展、AI公司利润、cr的影响",
