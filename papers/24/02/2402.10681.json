    "translated_abstract": "工程组件必须满足日益增长的技术需求，而且开发周期变得越来越短。为了应对这些挑战，需要一种整体化的方法，可以同时开发零件设计、材料系统和制造工艺。当前的方法使用数值仿真，然而对于迭代优化而言很快变得计算密集。数据驱动的机器学习方法可用于取代耗时和资源密集的数值仿真。具体而言，MeshGraphNets（MGNs）显示出令人满意的结果。它们可以在未知网格几何上进行快速准确的预测，同时对优化是完全可微的。然而，这些模型依赖于大量昂贵的训练数据，例如数值仿真。物理相关的神经网络（PINNs）提供了一种机会，使用偏微分方程而不是标记的数据来训练神经网络",
