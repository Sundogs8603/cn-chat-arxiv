Typically, the reduction approaches either remove edges (sparsification) or merge nodes (coarsening) in an unsupervised way with no specific downstream task in mind. In this paper, we present an approach for subsampling graph structures using an Ising model defined on either the nodes or edges and learning the external magnetic field of the Ising model using a graph neural network. Our approach is task-specific as it can learn how to reduce a graph for a specific downstream task in an end-to-end fashion. The utilized loss function of the task does not even have to be differentiable. We showcase the versatility of our approach on three distinct applications: image segmentation, 3D shape sparsification, and sparse approximate matrix inverse determination.",

    "translated_abstract": "减少图的大小同时保持其整体结构是一个具有许多应用的重要问题。通常，减小图的方法要么删除边缘（稀疏化），要么合并节点（粗化），而没有特定的下游任务。在本文中，我们提出了一种使用在节点或边上定义的伊辛模型对图结构进行子抽样的方法，并使用图神经网络学习伊辛模型的外部磁场。我们的方法是任务特定的，因为它可以端到端地学习如何为特定的下游任务减小图的大小。所使用的任务损失函数甚至不需要可微分性。我们在三个不同的应用上展示了我们方法的多功能性：图像分割、三维形状稀疏化和稀疏逼近矩阵求逆。",
