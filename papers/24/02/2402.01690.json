    "abstract": "This paper presents a deep learning method using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, to distinguish between Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Normal Cognitive (NC) conditions in older adults. We propose a framework that analyzes transcripts generated from video interviews collected within the I-CONECT study project, a randomized controlled trial aimed at improving cognitive functions through video chats. Our proposed NLP framework consists of two Transformer-based modules, namely Sentence Embedding (SE) and Sentence Cross Attention (SCA). First, the SE module captures contextual relationships between words within each sentence. Subsequently, the SCA module extracts temporal features from a sequence of sentences. This feature is then used by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for the classification of subjects into MCI or NC. To build a robust model, we propose a novel loss function, called InfoLoss, that considers the reduction in entropy by observing each sequence of sentences",

    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了一种使用自然语言处理（NLP）技术的深度学习方法，以区分老年人中的轻度认知障碍（MCI）和正常认知（NC）条件。我们提出了一个框架，该框架分析了在I-CONECT研究项目中收集的视频访谈中生成的转录文本，该项目是一项旨在通过视频聊天改善认知功能的随机对照试验。我们提出的NLP框架包括两个基于Transformer的模块，即句子嵌入（SE）和句子交叉注意力（SCA）。首先，SE模块捕捉每个句子中单词之间的上下文关系。接下来，SCA模块提取句子序列的时序特征。然后，这些特征由多层感知器（MLP）用于将被试分为MCI或NC。为了建立一个稳健的模型，我们提出了一种新的损失函数，称为信息损失（InfoLoss），该函数通过观察每个句子序列来考虑熵的减少。",
