    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11034v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Existing work on Temporal Question Answering (TQA) has predominantly focused on questions anchored to specific timestamps or events (e.g. \"Who was the US president in 1970?\"). Little work has studied questions whose temporal context is relative to the present time (e.g. \"Who was the previous US president?\"). We refer to this problem as Present-Anchored Temporal QA (PATQA). PATQA poses unique challenges: (1) large language models (LLMs) may have outdated knowledge, (2) complex temporal relationships (e.g. 'before', 'previous') are hard to reason, (3) multi-hop reasoning may be required, and (4) the gold answers of benchmarks must be continuously updated. To address these challenges, we introduce the PAT-Questions benchmark, which includes single and multi-hop temporal questions. The answers in PAT-Questions can be automatically refreshed by re-running SPARQL queries on a knowledge graph, if available. We evaluate several state-of-the-art ",

    "translated_abstract": "关于时间问答（TQA）的现有研究主要集中在锚定特定时间戳或事件的问题上（例如“1970年谁是美国总统？”）。很少有研究关注其时间背景相对于当前时间的问题（例如“之前的美国总统是谁？”）。我们将这个问题称为现在时刻为锚的时间问答（PATQA）。PATQA面临着独特的挑战：（1）大型语言模型（LLMs）可能具有过时的知识，（2）复杂的时间关系（例如“之前”，“以前”）难以推理，（3）可能需要多跳推理，（4）基准的正确答案必须持续更新。为了解决这些挑战，我们介绍了PAT-Questions基准，其中包括单跳和多跳时间问题。PAT-Questions中的答案可以通过在知识图上重新运行SPARQL查询来自动刷新。我们评估了几个最先进的",
