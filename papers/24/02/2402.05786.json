    "abstract": "Utilitarian games such as dictator games to measure fairness have been studied in the social sciences for decades. These games have given us insight into not only how humans view fairness but also in what conditions the frequency of fairness, altruism and greed increase or decrease. While these games have traditionally been focused on humans, the rise of AI gives us the ability to study how these models play these games. AI is becoming a constant in human interaction and examining how these models portray fairness in game play can give us some insight into how AI makes decisions. Over 101 rounds of the dictator game, I conclude that AI has a strong sense of fairness that is dependant of it it deems the person it is playing with as trustworthy, framing has a strong effect on how much AI gives a recipient when designated the trustee, and there may be evidence that AI experiences inequality aversion just as humans.",

    "translated_abstract": "几十年来，社会科学家们一直在研究测量公平性的功利主义游戏，比如独裁者游戏。这些游戏不仅让我们了解了人类对公平性的看法，还揭示了公平性、利他主义和贪婪在何种条件下增加或减少。尽管这些游戏传统上关注人类，但人工智能的崛起使我们能够研究这些模型如何玩这些游戏。人工智能正在成为人际互动中的常态，研究这些模型在游戏中显示的公平性可以让我们对人工智能的决策过程有所了解。通过101轮的独裁者游戏，我得出结论：人工智能具有强烈的公平意识，这与其认为它的游戏伙伴是否值得信任有关；设置对游戏的框架在人工智能给予接受者的数量上有很大影响，而且有可能存在证据表明人工智能也像人类一样具有厌恶不平等的情感。",
    "tldr": "人工智能作为游戏玩家能够展现出强烈的公平意识，取决于其对游戏伙伴的信任程度、游戏框架对于给予接受者的影响以及其可能存在厌恶不平等的情感。",
    "en_tdlr": "AI as game players can show a strong sense of fairness, depending on its trust in the game partner, the impact of game framing on giving to recipients, and the potential existence of inequality aversion."
