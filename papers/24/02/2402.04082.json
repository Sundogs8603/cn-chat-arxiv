    "abstract": "An accurate prediction of house prices is a fundamental requirement for various sectors including real estate and mortgage lending. It is widely recognized that a property value is not solely determined by its physical attributes but is significantly influenced by its surrounding neighbourhood. Meeting the diverse housing needs of individuals while balancing budget constraints is a primary concern for real estate developers. To this end, we addressed the house price prediction problem as a regression task and thus employed various machine learning techniques capable of expressing the significance of independent variables. We made use of the housing dataset of Ames City in Iowa, USA to compare support vector regressor, random forest regressor, XGBoost, multilayer perceptron and multiple linear regression algorithms for house price prediction. Afterwards, we identified the key factors that influence housing costs. Our results show that XGBoost is the best performing model for house price",

    "translated_abstract": "准确预测房价是房地产和抵押贷款等多个领域的基本要求。人们普遍认为，房产价值不仅仅由其物理属性决定，而且在很大程度上受到其周围社区的影响。在平衡预算限制的同时满足个人多样化的住房需求是房地产开发商的主要关注点。为此，我们将房价预测问题作为回归任务进行探讨，并采用了能够表达独立变量重要性的各种机器学习技术。我们使用了美国爱荷华州埃姆斯市的住房数据集，比较了支持向量回归、随机森林回归、XGBoost、多层感知器和多元线性回归算法在房价预测中的表现。随后，我们确定了影响房屋成本的关键因素。结果显示XGBoost是最佳的房价预测模型。",
