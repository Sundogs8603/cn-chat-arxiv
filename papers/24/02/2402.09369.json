    "translated_abstract": "预训练的大型语言模型已经为许多应用带来了革命，但仍面临与文化偏见相关的挑战，以及在引导跨文化沟通和互动中至关重要的文化常识知识的缺乏。鉴于现有方法在捕捉世界各地多样而丰富的文化方面的不足，本文引入了一种新颖的方法，用于大规模多元文化知识获取。具体而言，我们的方法从密集信息化的维基百科文档中战略导航到一个广泛的链接页面网络。利用这个宝贵的数据收集来源，我们构建了CultureAtlas数据集，该数据集涵盖了各种子国家级地理区域和民族语言群，通过数据清理和预处理确保文本断言句子的自我完整性，以及细粒度的文化个人档案信息提取。我们的数据集不仅",
