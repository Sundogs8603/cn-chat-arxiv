    "abstract": "Despite deep learning's widespread success, its data-hungry and computationally expensive nature makes it impractical for many data-constrained real-world applications. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) aims to address these limitations by enabling rapid adaptation to novel learning tasks, seeing significant growth in recent years. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the field's latest advancements. Initially, FSL is formally defined, and its relationship with different learning fields is presented. A novel taxonomy is introduced, extending previously proposed ones, and real-world applications in classic and novel fields are described. Finally, recent trends shaping the field, outstanding challenges, and promising future research directions are discussed.",
