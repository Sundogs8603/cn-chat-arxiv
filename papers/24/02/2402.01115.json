    "translated_abstract": "理解房颤(AFib)的不规则电活动一直是心电图学中的一个重要挑战。对于严重的房颤病例，进行导管消融以获取心内电图(EGMs)。EGMs提供了心脏电活动的复杂细节和局部化信息，是可解释的心脏研究的理想模式。近年来，人工智能(AI)的进展使得一些研究可以利用深度学习框架来解释房颤中的EGMs。此外，语言模型(LMs)在能够推广到未见过的领域方面表现出了出色的性能，尤其在医疗领域。在本研究中，我们首次利用预训练的LMs来通过掩码语言建模对EGM插值和房颤分类进行微调。我们将EGM形式化为文本序列，并与其他表示方法相比，在房颤分类方面展示了竞争性的性能。最后，我们提供了全面的解释性分析。",
