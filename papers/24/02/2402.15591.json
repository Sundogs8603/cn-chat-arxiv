RecWizard offers support for development of models and interactive user interface, drawing from the best practices of the Huggingface ecosystems. CRS with RecWizard are modular, portable, interactive and Large Language Models (LLMs)-friendly, to streamline the learning process and reduce the additional effort for CRS research.
