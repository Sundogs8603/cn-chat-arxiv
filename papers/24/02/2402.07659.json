    "translated_abstract": "在单一图形协作过滤（CF）向量中表示多个行为的信息一直是一个长期存在的挑战。这是因为不同的行为自然形成单独的行为图，并学习单独的CF嵌入。现有模型通过指定某些行为的CF嵌入作为主要嵌入，并利用其他辅助工具来增强主要嵌入来合并这些单独的嵌入。然而，这种方法通常在主要任务上联合嵌入表现良好，但在辅助任务上表现不佳。为了解决由单独的行为图引起的问题，我们提出了部分顺序图（POG）的概念。POG定义了多个行为的部分顺序关系，并将行为组合建模为带有权重的边，以将单独的行为图合并成一个联合的POG。理论证明了POG可以推广到任何给定的多个行为集。基于POG，我们提出了定制的部分顺序模型。",
