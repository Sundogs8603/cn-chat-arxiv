    "abstract": "Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has typically been addressed with cascade systems, where speech recognition systems generate a transcription that is subsequently passed to a translation model. While there has been a growing interest in developing direct speech translation systems to avoid propagating errors and losing non-verbal content, prior work in direct S2TT has struggled to conclusively establish the advantages of integrating the acoustic signal directly into the translation process. This work proposes using contrastive evaluation to quantitatively measure the ability of direct S2TT systems to disambiguate utterances where prosody plays a crucial role. Specifically, we evaluated Korean-English translation systems on a test set containing wh-phrases, for which prosodic features are necessary to produce translations with the correct intent, whether it's a statement, a yes/no question, a wh-question, and more. Our results clearly demonstrate the value of direct translation systems",

    "translated_abstract": "语音-文本翻译（S2TT）通常使用串联系统进行处理，其中语音识别系统生成一个转录，随后传递给翻译模型。尽管在开发直接语音翻译系统以避免传播错误和丢失非语言内容方面越来越感兴趣，但之前的直接S2TT工作难以确定地证明将声学信号直接整合到翻译过程中的优势。本研究提出使用对比评估以定量衡量直接S2TT系统在消除韵律对话中的歧义方面的能力。具体而言，我们在一个包含WH短语的测试集上评估了韩语-英语翻译系统，对于该测试集来说，使用韵律特征是产生具有正确意图的翻译的必要条件，无论是陈述句、是非问句还是疑问句等。我们的结果清楚地证明了直接翻译系统的价值。",
