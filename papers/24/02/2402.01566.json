    "translated_abstract": "在视频合成中，生成丰富且可控的动作是一个重大的挑战。我们提出了一种新的方法Boximator，用于精细的动作控制。Boximator引入了两种约束类型：硬盒和软盒。用户使用硬盒在条件帧中选择对象，然后使用两种类型的盒子来粗略或严格地定义对象在未来帧中的位置、形状或运动路径。Boximator作为现有视频扩散模型的插件运行。它的训练过程通过冻结原始权重，只训练控制模块来保留基础模型的知识。为了解决训练中的挑战，我们引入了一种新颖的自我追踪技术，大大简化了盒子对象之间的关联学习。实验证明，Boximator在视频质量（FVD）得分上达到了最先进的水平，改进了两个基准模型，并在加入盒子约束后进一步提高。其稳健的运动可控性通过边界的剧增得到验证。",
