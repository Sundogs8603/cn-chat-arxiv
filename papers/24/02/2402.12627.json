    "translated_abstract": "近期的人工智能（AI）技术在各个学术领域和行业都展现了显著的发展，然而，在现实世界中，动态数据导致了部署AI模型的主要挑战。意外的数据变化会导致AI模型性能严重下降。我们确定了两个主要相关研究领域，领域转移和概念漂移，根据数据变化的设定。虽然这两个流行的研究领域的目标是解决分布偏移和非平稳数据流问题，但基本属性仍然相似，这也鼓励采用类似的技术方法。在这篇综述中，我们将领域转移和概念漂移重新组合成一个单一的研究问题，即数据变化问题，并系统地概述了这两个研究领域中最新方法。我们提出了一个三阶段问题分类方案，以将这两个技术领域的关键思想联系起来。",
