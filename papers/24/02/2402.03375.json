    "translated_abstract": "由于现代集成电路（IC）日益复杂，需要自动化的电路设计方法。近年来，硬件设计语言生成方面的研究不断增多，以便促进设计过程。在本文中，我们提出了一个Verilog生成框架BetterV，该框架在处理特定领域数据集的基础上对大型语言模型（LLMs）进行微调，并结合生成判别器以指导特定设计需求。Verilog模块是从互联网中收集、过滤和处理，形成了一个干净而丰富的数据集。通过Instruct-tuning方法，对LLMs进行精细调整，以了解关于Verilog的知识。此外，通过数据增强丰富训练集，并用于训练特定下游任务的生成判别器，为LLMs优化Verilog实现提供指导。BetterV能够生成语法和功能上正确的Verilog实现。",
