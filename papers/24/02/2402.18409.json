Inspired by the prevalent use of the \"Cookie Theft\" task in human cognition test, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark to evaluate high-level cognitive ability of LVLMs using images with rich semantics. It defines eight reasoning capabilities and consists of an image description task and a visual question answering task. Our evaluation on well-known LVLMs shows that there is still a large gap in cognitive ability between LVLMs and humans.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)近年来取得了成功，但它们很少受到全面的认知能力测试。受到人类认知测试中广泛使用的“偷饼干”任务的启发，我们提出了一个新颖的评估基准，利用具有丰富语义的图像评估LVLMs的高级认知能力。它定义了八种推理能力，并包括图像描述任务和视觉问答任务。我们对知名LVLMs进行的评估表明，在LVLMs和人类之间仍存在较大的认知能力差距。",
