To address this, we introduce MetaTree, which trains a transformer-based model on filtered outputs from classical algorithms to produce strong decision trees for classification. Specifically, we fit both greedy decision trees and optimized decision trees on a large number of datasets. We then train MetaTree to produce the trees that achieve strong generalization performance. This training enables MetaTree to not only emulate these algorithms, but also to intelligently adapt its strategy according to the context, thereby achieving superior generalization performance.",

    "translated_abstract": "决策树因其可解释性和在表格数据上实现高预测性能而闻名。传统上，决策树是通过递归算法构建的，在树的每个节点上将数据进行分区。然而，确定最佳分区是具有挑战性的，因为针对局部段优化的决策树可能无法带来全局概括。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了MetaTree，该模型使用经典算法的过滤输出来训练基于Transformer的模型，以产生强大的分类决策树。具体而言，我们在大量数据集上拟合贪婪决策树和优化决策树。然后，我们训练MetaTree产生具有强大概括性能的决策树。这种训练使MetaTree不仅可以模拟这些算法，还可以根据上下文智能地调整策略，从而实现更强的概括性能。",
