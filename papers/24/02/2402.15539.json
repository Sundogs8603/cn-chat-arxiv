This paper introduces a speech corpus specifically designed for Korean children with ASD, aiming to advance speech technologies such as pronunciation and severity evaluation. Speech recordings from speech and language evaluation sessions were transcribed, and annotated for articulatory and linguistic characteristics. Three speech and language pathologists rated these recordings for social communication severity (SCS) and pronunciation proficiency (PP) using a 3-point Likert scale. The total number of participants will be 300 for children with ASD and 50 for typically developing (TD) children. The paper also analyzes acoustic and linguistic features extracted from speech data collected and completed for annotation from 73 children with ASD and 9 TD children to i",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管对自闭症谱系障碍（ASD）儿童数字化治疗的需求不断增长，但目前尚无针对韩国ASD儿童的语音语料库。本文介绍了一个专为韩国ASD儿童设计的语音语料库，旨在推进语音技术，如发音和严重程度评估。语音与语言评估会话中的语音录音被转录，并针对发音和语言特征进行了注释。三名语音与语言病理师使用3点力克特量表对这些录音进行了社交沟通严重程度（SCS）和发音熟练度（PP）评分。参与者总数将有300名ASD儿童和50名正常发育（TD）儿童。本文还分析了从收集的语音数据中提取并完成注释的73名ASD儿童和9名TD儿童的声学和语言特征。",
