This work introduces a novel distributed machine learning paradigm -- \\emph{consensus learning} -- which combines classical ensemble methods with consensus protocols deployed in peer-to-peer systems. These algorithms consist of two phases: first, participants develop their models and submit predictions for any new data inputs; second, the individual predictions are used as inputs for a communication phase, which is governed by a consensus protocol.

    "translated_abstract": "最近大规模机器学习模型的广泛采用突显了分布式计算在效率和可扩展性上的需求。本文引入了一种新颖的分布式机器学习范式--共识学习--将经典集成方法与部署在对等系统中的共识协议相结合。这些算法包括两个阶段：首先，参与者开发他们的模型并为任何新数据输入提交预测；其次，个体预测被用作通信阶段的输入，该阶段由共识协议控制。共识学习确保用户数据隐私，同时也继承了基础共识机制对拜占庭攻击的安全措施。我们为特定的共识协议提供了详细的理论分析，并将共识学习集成的性能与中心化集成学习算法进行了比较。",
