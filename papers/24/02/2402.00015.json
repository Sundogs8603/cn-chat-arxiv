    "abstract": "This paper describes and evaluates a multistage approach to AI deployment. Each stage involves a more accurate method of inference, yet engaging each comes with an increasing cost. In outlining the architecture, we present a method for quantifying model uncertainty that facilitates confident deferral decisions. The architecture is currently under active deployment to thousands of cotton farmers across India. The broader idea however is applicable to a growing sector of AI deployments in challenging low resources settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文描述并评估了一种多阶段的人工智能部署方法。每个阶段都涉及一种更准确的推理方法，但每个阶段的开销也逐渐增加。在概述架构时，我们提出了一种量化模型不确定性的方法，以促进有信心的延期决策。该架构目前正在印度的数千名棉农中进行积极部署。然而，这个更广泛的想法也适用于在具有挑战性的低资源环境中进行人工智能部署的不断增长的领域。",
