    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.14440v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recommender systems have been widely used for various scenarios, such as e-commerce, news, and music, providing online contents to help and enrich users' daily life. Different scenarios hold distinct and unique characteristics, calling for domain-specific investigations and corresponding designed recommender systems. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on food delivery recommendations to unveil unique features in this domain, where users order food online and enjoy their meals shortly after delivery. We first conduct an in-depth analysis on food delivery datasets. The analysis shows that repeat orders are prevalent for both users and stores, and situations' differently influence repeat and exploration consumption in the food delivery recommender systems. Moreover, we revisit the ability of existing situation-aware methods for repeat and exploration recommendations respectively, and find them unable to effectively solve both tasks simultan",

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统已被广泛应用于各种场景，例如电子商务、新闻和音乐，提供在线内容以帮助和丰富用户的日常生活。在本文中，我们专注于食品配送推荐，揭示该领域的独特特征，用户在线订购食物，并在送达后不久享用餐点。我们首先对食品配送数据集进行深入分析。分析显示，用户和商家均存在重复订单，并且情境不同影响着食品配送推荐系统中的重复和探索消费。此外，我们重新审视现有情境感知方法分别用于重复和探索推荐，并发现它们无法有效地同时解决这两个任务。",
