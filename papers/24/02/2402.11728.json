    "title": "Numerical Claim Detection in Finance: A New Financial Dataset, Weak-Supervision Model, and Market Analysis",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11728v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of claims in analyst reports and earnings calls on financial market returns, considering them as significant quarterly events for publicly traded companies. To facilitate a comprehensive analysis, we construct a new financial dataset for the claim detection task in the financial domain. We benchmark various language models on this dataset and propose a novel weak-supervision model that incorporates the knowledge of subject matter experts (SMEs) in the aggregation function, outperforming existing approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our proposed model by constructing a novel measure ``optimism\". Furthermore, we observed the dependence of earnings surprise and return on our optimism measure. Our dataset, models, and code will be made publicly (under CC BY 4.0 license) available on GitHub and Hugging Face.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们研究了分析师报告和盈利电话中的索赔对金融市场回报的影响，将它们视为上市公司重要的季度事件。为了进行全面的分析，我们构建了一个新的金融数据集，用于金融领域的索赔检测任务。我们在该数据集上对各种语言模型进行了基准测试，并提出了一种融入主题专家（SMEs）知识的新型弱监督模型，在聚合函数中超越了现有方法。此外，我们通过构建一种新的度量“乐观主义”展示了我们提出的模型的实际效用。我们还观察到盈利惊喜和回报对我们的乐观主义度量的依赖。我们的数据集、模型和代码将在GitHub和Hugging Face上公开（遵循CC BY 4.0许可）。",
