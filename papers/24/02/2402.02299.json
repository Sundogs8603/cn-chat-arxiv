    "translated_abstract": "侧信道分析（SCA）对现代计算系统的隐私和安全构成了明确的威胁。绝大多数通信都是通过密码算法进行保护的。这些算法在密码学角度上往往是可证明安全的，但是它们在实际硬件上的实现会引入漏洞。攻击者可以利用这些漏洞来进行SCA，并恢复机密信息，如密钥或内部状态。随着机器学习，尤其是深度学习增强攻击变得更加普遍，SCA的威胁也大大增加。在这项工作中，我们将研究最新的深度学习技术在侧信道分析中的应用，以及其背后的理论和实施方法。我们的重点将放在使用深度学习技术进行的模型攻击上，同时还将研究一些新兴的由深度学习技术增强的方法，如非模型攻击、人工迹线生成等。",
