    "translated_abstract": "零样本学习为没有目标实例的目标提供了模型，通常称为未观察到的目标。在这种情况下，目标侧信息的可用性变得至关重要，以便正确地诱导这些目标的模型。文献中有许多应对这种情况的策略，但大多是基于零样本分类场景而设计的，主要用于计算机视觉和图像分类，但对于连续值预测的零样本回归框架来说，它们要么不适用，要么不容易扩展。事实上，文献中缺乏针对零样本回归的方法。最近提出了两种适用于零样本回归的两阶段过程的方法。它们首先通过传统的回归学习学习观察到的目标模型，忽略目标侧信息。然后，它们在之后聚合这些观察到的目标模型，进一步利用目标侧信息。",

This approach provides a new solution for the problem of zero-shot regression."
