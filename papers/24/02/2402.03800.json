    "abstract": "We provide ex-post empirical analysis of the effects of climate policies on carbon dioxide emissions at the aggregate national level. Our results are based on a comprehensive database of 121 countries. As climate policies we examine carbon taxes and emissions trading systems (ETS), as well as the overall stringency of climate policies. We use dynamic panel regressions, controlling for macroeconomic factors such as economic development, GDP growth, urbanisation, as well as the energy mix. We find that higher carbon taxes and prices of permits in ETS reduce carbon emissions. An increase in carbon taxes by $10 per ton of CO2 reduces CO2 emissions per capita by 1.3% in the short run and by 4.6% in the long run.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们对全国层面的气候政策对二氧化碳排放的影响进行了事后实证分析。我们的结果基于一个包含121个国家的全面数据库。作为气候政策，我们考察了碳税和排放交易系统(ETS)，以及气候政策的总体严格程度。我们采用动态面板回归，控制了宏观经济因素，如经济发展、GDP增长、城市化以及能源组成。我们发现，更高的碳税和ETS许可证价格会减少二氧化碳排放。每吨二氧化碳的碳税增加10美元，在短期内使二氧化碳排放人均减少1.3%，在长期内减少4.6%。",
