    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了自学习大型语言模型（LLM）的主要问题：即如何学习自己不知道的知识。我们提出了一种自学习LLM框架，通过对自己的幻觉进行自我评估，使LLM能够独立地学习以前未知的知识。通过使用幻觉评分，我们引入了一个称为“未知点”的新概念，并提出了一种外部和三种内部方法来自动识别未知点。这有助于创建一个自学习循环，专注于未知点中的知识差距，从而减少幻觉评分。我们还开发了用于评估LLM自学习能力的评估指标。我们的实验证明，已经进行了微调或对齐的7B-Mistral模型在自学习方面表现出色。我们的自学习概念可以实现更高效的LLM更新，并为知识交流开辟新的可能性。它还可能增加公众的信任。",
