    "translated_abstract": "特征归因是一种定位输入数据中与分类相关的区域的能力，对于科学和生物医学领域的机器学习模型而言，这是一种重要的能力。当前的特征归因方法依赖于“解释”端到端分类器的预测，存在特征定位不精确以及由于计算挑战而无法在小样本尺寸和高维数据集上使用的问题。我们引入了探寻者头部（prospector heads），这是一种高效且可解释的基于特征归因的替代方法，可以应用于任何编码器和任何数据形态。通过对序列（文本）、图像（病理学）和图（蛋白质结构）的实验，探寻者头部在模态之间进行概括，表现优于基线归因方法，平均局部化AUPRC得分提升了高达49点。我们还演示了探寻者头部如何实现了改进的解释能力。",
