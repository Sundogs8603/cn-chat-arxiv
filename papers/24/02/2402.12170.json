Followed by instruction-tuning, LLM acquires the ability to return correct information for diverse questions. However, adapting these pre-trained LLMs to new target domains, such as different organizations or periods, for the question-answering (QA) task incurs a substantial annotation cost. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel task, unsupervised LLM adaptation for question answering. In this task, we leverage a pre-trained LLM, a publicly available QA dataset (source data), and unlabeled documents from the target domain. Our goal is to learn LLM that can answer questions about the target domain. We introduce one synthetic and two real datasets to evaluate models fine-tuned on the source and target data, and reveal intriguing insights; (i) fine-tuned models exhibit the ability to provide correct answers ",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）通过自监督训练学习大规模训练数据集中的多样化知识。接着通过指导微调，LLM能够返回多样问题的正确信息。然而，将这些预训练的LLM调整到新的目标领域，如不同组织或时期，用于问答任务会产生很高的注释成本。为解决这一挑战，我们提出了一个新颖的任务，即无监督LLM适应问答任务。在这个任务中，我们利用预训练的LLM、一个公开可用的问答数据集（源数据）和目标域的未标记文档。我们的目标是学习LLM，使其能够回答关于目标领域的问题。我们引入了一个合成数据集和两个真实数据集来评估在源数据和目标数据上微调的模型，并揭示了一些有趣的见解；（i）微调模型展示了提供正确答案的能力",
