    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）在节点分类方面取得了显著的进展，但其成功仍然依赖于训练数据中每个类别有足够的标记节点。现实世界中的图数据通常呈现出长尾分布，标签稀疏，强调了GNN在少样本节点分类中的重要性，即使用有限的数据对节点进行分类。传统的情节元学习方法在这个领域显示出了潜力，但它们面临着固有的限制：随机和均匀任务分配可能导致模型收敛到次优解，忽视了任务的难度水平。这可能导致元学习器过早地面临复杂任务，阻碍了正常的学习。理想情况下，元学习器应该从简单概念开始，逐渐进入更复杂的概念，就像人类学习一样。因此，我们引入了CPT，一种新颖的两阶段课程学习方法，将任务难度与元学习器的递进能力相匹配，增强了元学习的效果和稳定性。",
