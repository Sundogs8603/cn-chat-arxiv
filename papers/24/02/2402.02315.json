    "title": "A Survey of Large Language Models in Finance (FinLLMs)",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across a wide variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and have attracted attention from multiple domains, including financial services. Despite the extensive research into general-domain LLMs, and their immense potential in finance, Financial LLM (FinLLM) research remains limited. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of FinLLMs, including their history, techniques, performance, and opportunities and challenges. Firstly, we present a chronological overview of general-domain Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) through to current FinLLMs, including the GPT-series, selected open-source LLMs, and financial LMs. Secondly, we compare five techniques used across financial PLMs and FinLLMs, including training methods, training data, and fine-tuning methods. Thirdly, we summarize the performance evaluations of six benchmark tasks and datasets. In addition, we provide eight advanced financial NLP tasks and datasets",

    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLMs）在包括金融服务在内的多个领域展示出了卓越的自然语言处理（NLP）能力，并引起了广泛关注。尽管对于通用领域的LLMs进行了广泛的研究，并且它们在金融领域有着巨大的潜力，但金融领域的语言模型研究还很有限。本综述全面介绍了金融领域的LLMs，包括它们的历史、技术、性能以及机遇和挑战。首先，我们从通用领域的预训练语言模型（PLMs）到当前的FinLLMs，包括GPT系列、选定的开源LLMs和金融LMs，提供了时间顺序的概述。其次，我们比较了金融PLMs和FinLLMs中使用的五种技术，包括训练方法、训练数据和微调方法。第三，我们总结了六个基准任务和数据集的性能评估。此外，我们还提供了八个高级金融NLP任务和数据集。",
