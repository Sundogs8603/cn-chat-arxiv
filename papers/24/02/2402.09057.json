We introduce a prototype garment, compact readout circuit, and algorithm to measure localized strain along multiple regions of a fibre.

    "translated_abstract": "纺织传感器将我们日常穿着的衣物完全无干扰地转化为追踪运动和生物信号的手段。但是，当传感器数量扩大时，连接和空间成为采用“智能”服装的主要障碍。现有研究中存在一个关键限制：刚性和纺织元素之间的连接常常不可靠，并且需要以与纺织品大规模生产方法不兼容的方式与传感器进行接口。我们引入了一个原型服装、紧凑读出电路和算法，以测量纤维多个区域的局部应变。我们使用具有可调灵敏度的螺旋辅助弹性纱线传感器，以选择性地对应变信号作出反应。我们在服装上展示了分布式感应，在单个连续纤维上监测手臂关节角度。与光学运动捕捉相比，我们实现了约5倍的性能提升。",
