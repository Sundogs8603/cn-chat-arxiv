    "translated_abstract": "异常检测在确保网络鲁棒性方面起着至关重要的作用。然而，在考虑了恶意和非恶意事件都可能引起异常情况的情况下，实施智能报警系统变得具有挑战性，难以确定异常模式。计算机网络领域中缺乏带标签的数据进一步加剧了这个问题，在处理现实场景时阻碍了开发具有鲁棒性模型的发展。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一个端到端的异常检测模型开发流程。该框架可以接受用户反馈，并实现持续的用户中心模型性能评估和优化。我们通过引入并基准测试一个名为\"Lachesis\"的新预测模型来展示该框架的有效性，在一个真实的网络问题上进行了实验。实验结果证明了这个框架的鲁棒性。",
