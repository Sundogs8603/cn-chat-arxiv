Model-based approaches have been used to address this, but such methods often suffer from artefacts associated with moving content. Conversely, deep learning based methods are dependent on large and diverse datasets that may not effectively represent any specific content. In this paper, we address these problems with a self-supervised learning method that does not require ground truth. The proposed method is not dependent on any dataset outside of the single data sequence being processed but is also able to improve the quality of any input raw sequences or pre-processed sequences. Specifically, our method is based on an accelerated Deep Image Prior (DIP), but integrates temporal information using pixel shuffling and a temporal sliding window.
