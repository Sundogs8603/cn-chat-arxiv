Conventional methods like membership inference can carry out this detection with some level of accuracy. We show that watermarked training data leaves traces easier to detect and much more reliable than membership inference. We link the contamination level to the watermark robustness, its proportion in the training set, and the fine-tuning process. We notably demonstrate that training on watermarked synthetic instructions can be detected with high confidence (p-value < 1e-5) even when as little as 5% of training text is watermarked. Thus, LLM watermarking, originally designed for detecting machine-generated text, gives the ability to easily identify if the outputs of a watermarked LLM were used to fine-tune another LLM.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了LLM生成的文本的放射性，即是否可以检测到这种输入被用作训练数据。传统方法如成员推断可以以一定水平的准确性进行这种检测。我们表明，带有数字水印的训练数据留下的痕迹比成员推断更容易检测且更可靠。我们将污染水平与水印的鲁棒性、在训练集中的比例和微调过程联系起来。特别是我们展示，即使只有5％的训练文本被数字水印标记，训练在带有数字水印的合成指令上仍然可以具有高置信度（p值<1e-5）被检测到。因此，原本设计用于检测机器生成文本的LLM水印技术，使我们能够轻松确定带有数字水印的LLM的输出是否被用来对另一个LLM进行微调。",
