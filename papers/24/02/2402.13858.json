    "translated_abstract": "$k$-最大内积搜索($k$MIPS)作为推荐系统和各种数据挖掘任务中的基础组件。然而，尽管大多数现有的$k$MIPS方法优先考虑为用户高度相关的项目进行高效检索，但它们经常忽略了搜索结果同样关键的一个方面：\\emph{多样性}。为了弥补这一差距，我们重新审视和完善了多样性感知$k$MIPS（D$k$MIPS）问题，通过将两个众所周知的多样性目标--在结果中最小化平均和最大成对项目相似性--融入原始相关性目标。这种增强受到了极大边际相关性（MMR）的启发，为用户提供了关于相关性和多样性之间可控的权衡。我们引入了\\textsc{Greedy}和\\textsc{DualGreedy}，这两种基于线性扫描的算法专门用于D$k$MIPS。它们都实现了数据依赖的近似，并在旨在最小化平均成对相似性。",
