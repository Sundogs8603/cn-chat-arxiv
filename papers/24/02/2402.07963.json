    "translated_abstract": "发展能够在决策和学习过程中利用规划能力的智能体对于人工智能的进步至关重要。最近的研究已经证明了树状搜索方法和自我对弈学习机制的有效性。然而，由于搜索过程的顺序性质，这些方法通常面临扩展性挑战。虽然实践工程解决方案可以部分克服这个问题，但仍需要大量计算资源，这限制了它们的适用性。在本文中，我们介绍一种名为SMX的基于模型的计划算法，它利用可扩展的顺序蒙特卡洛方法创建了一种有效的自我学习机制。SMX基于控制作为推断的理论框架，并受益于坚实的理论基础。它基于采样的搜索方法使其适应具有离散和连续动作空间的环境。此外，SMX允许高度并行化并可以运行于各类计算机设备上。",
