    "translated_abstract": "Foundation模型（FMs），如大型语言模型（LLMs），通过实现新的用例和商业模型，彻底改变了软件开发。我们将使用FMs构建的软件称为FMware。FMware的独特属性（例如提示、代理和编排的需求），与FMs的内在限制（例如幻觉）结合起来，导致了一系列全新的软件工程挑战。根据我们的工业经验，我们确定了10个关键的SE4FMware挑战，导致企业FMware开发变得低效、成本高昂且风险高。在本文中，我们详细讨论了这些挑战，并阐明了我们设想的创新路径。接下来，我们提出了FMArts，这是我们为构建可信FMware而进行的长期努力。最后，我们展示了FMArts的独特属性如何使我们能够为一种大型FMware设计和开发一个复杂系统。",
