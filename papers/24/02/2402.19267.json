    "translated_abstract": "使用大量数据集可以训练多语言机器翻译模型；然而，这些模型通常无法准确翻译专业领域中的句子。获得和翻译领域特定数据虽然成本高昂，但对于高质量翻译是不可避免的。因此，在无监督设置中找到最“有效”的数据成为减少标注成本的实用策略。最近的研究表明，可以通过选择“适当困难的数据”来找到这些有效数据，这意味着数据不应过于困难或过于简单，尤其是在数据量有限的情况下。然而，我们发现建立无监督数据选择标准仍具挑战性，因为“适当困难度”可能因所训练的数据领域而异。我们引入了一种新颖的无监督数据选择方法，‘Capturing Perplexing Named Entities’。",
