    "translated_abstract": "傅里叶分析在信号处理的发展中起到了重要的作用。这使我们想知道这个框架是否能够同样有益于生成模型。在本文中，我们通过时间序列扩散模型的范围来探讨这个问题。具体来说，我们分析了在频域中表示时间序列是否对基于评分的扩散模型具有有用的归纳偏差。通过从时间域中扩散的经典SDE公式出发，我们展示了在频域中发生了一种双重扩散过程，并具有一个重要的细微差别：布朗运动被我们称之为镜像布朗运动所取代，其特征是其组分之间的镜像对称性。在此基础上，我们展示了如何通过适应去噪评分匹配方法来实现频域中的扩散模型。这导致了频域扩散模型，我们将其与经典的时间扩散模型进行了比较。我们在实际工作上进行了实证评估。",
