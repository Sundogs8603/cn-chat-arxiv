    "translated_abstract": "指挥与控制（C2）通道是许多类型的网络攻击的必要组成部分，它们使攻击者能够远程控制被恶意软件感染的计算机，并执行有害的行动，如在网络中传播恶意代码、窃取机密数据或发起分布式拒绝服务（DDoS）攻击。因此，识别这些C2通道对于减轻和防止网络攻击至关重要。然而，识别C2通道通常涉及手动过程，需要深入了解和专业技术的网络操作知识。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于强化学习的方法，通过同时使用正常（公共）网络和Tor网络来自动模拟C2攻击活动。此外，配置有效载荷大小和网络防火墙以模拟真实的攻击场景。在典型网络配置上的结果显示，强化学习代理可以自动发现具有韧性的C2通道。",
