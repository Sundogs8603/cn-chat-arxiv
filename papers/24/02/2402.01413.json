    "translated_abstract": "基于监督模型的语音增强方法是通过人工合成的干净语音和噪声信号混合来训练的。然而，合成训练条件可能无法准确反映测试过程中遇到的真实世界条件。这种差异可能导致在测试域与合成训练域显著不同时性能不佳。为了解决这个问题，第七届CHiME挑战赛的UDASE任务旨在利用测试域的真实世界噪声语音录音来对语音增强模型进行无监督域适应。具体来说，这个测试域对应于CHiME-5数据集，该数据集由在嘈杂和混响的家庭环境中进行的真实多说话人对话录音组成，无法获得地面实况干净语音信号。在本文中，我们介绍了提交到CHiME-7 UDASE任务的系统的客观和主观评估，并对结果进行了分析",
