However, the existing LLM-driven conversational agents have fixed personalities and functionalities, limiting their adaptability to individual user needs. Creating personalized agent personas with distinct expertise or traits can address this issue. Nonetheless, we lack knowledge of how people customize and interact with agent personas. In this research, we investigated how users customize agent personas and their impact on interaction quality, diversity, and dynamics. To this end, we developed CloChat, an interface supporting easy and accurate customization of agent personas in LLMs. We conducted a study comparing how participants interact with CloChat and ChatGPT. The results indicate that participants formed emotional bonds with the customized agents, engaged",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)已经在生成对话代理方面取得了重大进展，实现了在不同主题上进行无缝、具有上下文相关性的对话。然而，现有的LLM驱动的对话代理具有固定的个性和功能，限制了它们对个体用户需求的适应性。创建具有不同专业知识或特点的个性化代理人设可以解决这个问题。尽管如此，我们缺乏关于人们如何定制和互动代理人设的知识。在这项研究中，我们调查了用户如何定制代理人设以及它们对互动质量、多样性和动态的影响。为此，我们开发了CloChat，这是一种支持在LLMs中轻松准确定制代理人设的界面。我们进行了一项研究，比较参与者如何与CloChat和ChatGPT进行互动。结果表明，参与者与定制代理人设建立了情感联系，参与了...",
