    "translated_abstract": "垃圾邮件是未经请求的恼人且有时有害的消息，可能含有恶意软件、钓鱼或恶作剧。与大多数研究解决高效反垃圾邮件过滤器设计的问题不同，我们从不同和新颖的角度来解决垃圾邮件问题。重点关注网络安全单位的需求，我们采用基于主题的方法来对垃圾邮件进行多类别分类。我们提出了两个新颖的数据集SPEMC-15K-E和SPEMC-15K-S，分别包含大约15K封英文和西班牙文邮件，并使用凝聚层次聚类将其划分为11个类别。我们评估了16种流水线，结合了四种文本表示技术-词频-逆文档频率（TF-IDF）、词袋模型、Word2Vec和BERT-以及四种分类器：支持向量机、朴素贝叶斯、随机森林和逻辑回归。实验结果表明，在英文数据集中，TF-IDF和LR的性能最好，",
