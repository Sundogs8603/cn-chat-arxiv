    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11185v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Identifying phases of flight is important in the field of general aviation, as knowing which phase of flight data is collected from aircraft flight data recorders can aid in the more effective detection of safety or hazardous events. General aviation flight data for phase of flight identification is usually per-second data, comes on a large scale, and is class imbalanced. It is expensive to manually label the data and training classification models usually faces class imbalance problems. This work investigates the use of a novel method for minimally supervised self-organizing maps (MS-SOMs) which utilize nearest neighbor majority votes in the SOM U-matrix for class estimation. Results show that the proposed method can reach or exceed a naive SOM approach which utilized a full data file of labeled data, with only 30 labeled datapoints per class. Additionally, the minimally supervised SOM is significantly more robust to the class imbalance",

    "translated_abstract": "在通用航空领域，识别飞行阶段是重要的，因为了解从飞行器飞行数据记录器收集的数据处于哪个飞行阶段，可以帮助更有效地检测安全或危险事件。本文研究了一种新的最小监督自组织映射（MS-SOMs）方法，该方法利用SOM U-矩阵中的最近邻多数投票进行类估计。结果表明，所提出的方法可以达到或超过使用完整标记数据文件的朴素SOM方法，每个类别仅需要30个标记数据点。此外，最小监督SOM对类别不平衡更具鲁棒性。",
