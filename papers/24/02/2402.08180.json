    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了具有完全信息反馈的在线结构化预测。对于在线多类分类，van der Hoeven(2020)通过引入一个优美的“利用替代间隙”的框架，获得了与时间范围无关的替代后悔度界限，即有限的界限。然而，这个框架主要限于多类分类，因为它依赖于一种特定于分类的过程，将估计得分转化为输出。我们将“利用替代间隙”框架扩展到具有“Fenchel-Young损失”的在线结构化预测中，这是一大类包括多类分类的逻辑损失在内的替代损失，获得了在各种结构化预测问题上的有限替代后悔度界限。为此，我们提出并分析了随机解码，将估计得分转化为一般的结构化输出。此外，通过将我们的解码应用于在线多类分类与逻辑损失，我们获得了改进的替代后悔度界限。",
