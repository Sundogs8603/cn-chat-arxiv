    "abstract": "For half a century, artificial intelligence research has attempted to reproduce the human qualities of abstraction and reasoning - creating computer systems that can learn new concepts from a minimal set of examples, in settings where humans find this easy. While specific neural networks are able to solve an impressive range of problems, broad generalisation to situations outside their training data has proved elusive.In this work, we look at several novel approaches for solving the Abstraction & Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a dataset of abstract visual reasoning tasks introduced to test algorithms on broad generalization. Despite three international competitions with $100,000 in prizes, the best algorithms still fail to solve a majority of ARC tasks and rely on complex hand-crafted rules, without using machine learning at all. We revisit whether recent advances in neural networks allow progress on this task.   First, we adapt the DreamCoder neurosymbolic reasoning solver to ARC. DreamCoder",

    "translated_abstract": "半个世纪以来，人工智能研究一直试图复制人类的抽象和推理能力-创造出能够从一小组示例中学习新概念的计算机系统，在人们发现这很容易的情况下。虽然特定的神经网络能够解决各种各样的问题，但对于超越训练数据范围的广泛泛化仍然是一个难题。在这项工作中，我们研究了几种解决抽象与推理语料库（ARC）的新方法，ARC是一个用于测试算法在广泛泛化方面的抽象视觉推理任务数据集。尽管有三个国际竞赛提供了10万美元的奖金，最好的算法仍然无法解决大多数ARC任务，并且依赖于复杂的手工规则，没有使用机器学习。我们重新思考了最近神经网络的进展是否能在这个任务上取得进展。首先，我们将DreamCoder神经符号推理求解器应用到ARC上。",
