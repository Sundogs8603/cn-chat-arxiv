    "translated_abstract": "可信集合是被视为不确定已知真实分布的候选概率分布集合。在机器学习中，由于可信集合能够表示预测中的不确定性，尤其是能够表示预测的aleatoric和epistemic不确定性，因此近来已经引起了关注。然而，设计用于学习可信集合预测器的方法仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。在本文中，我们利用一致预测来解决这个问题。更具体地，我们提出了一种用于在分类任务中预测可信集合的方法，该方法利用标记为概率分布的训练数据。由于我们的方法继承了一致预测的覆盖性保证，我们的一致可信集合有很高的概率保证是有效的（而无需对模型或分布做出任何假设）。我们展示了我们的方法在自然语言中的适用性。",
