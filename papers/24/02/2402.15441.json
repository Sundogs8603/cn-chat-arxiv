We show that few-shot fine-tuning is an instance of a generalization of classical active learning, transductive active learning, and we propose ITL, short for information-based transductive learning, an approach which samples adaptively to maximize the information gained about specified downstream tasks. Under general regularity assumptions, we prove that ITL converges uniformly to the smallest possible uncertainty obtainable from the accessible data. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to derive generalization bounds of this kind, and they may be of independent interest for active learning. We apply ITL to the few-shot fine-tuning of large neural networks and show that ITL substantially improves upon the state-of-the-art.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了大型神经网络对下游任务进行主动少样本微调。我们表明少样本微调是传统主动学习和转导主动学习的泛化实例，我们提出了信息基于转导学习（ITL）的方法，该方法自适应地进行采样以最大化获得对指定下游任务的信息。在一般正则性假设下，我们证明ITL均匀收敛到可从可访问数据获取的最小可能的不确定性。据我们所知，我们是首批推导出这种泛化界限的人，这对于主动学习可能是具有独立意义的。我们将ITL应用于大型神经网络的少样本微调中，结果显示ITL明显改进了现有技术。",
