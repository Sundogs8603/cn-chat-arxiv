Since goods are public, they have no capacity constraints. There is no exogenously defined budget of goods to be provided. Rather, each provided good must justify its cost, leading to strong complementarities in the \"preferences\" of goods. Furthermore, goods that are in high demand given other already-provided goods must also be provided. The question of the existence of a stable solution (a menu of public goods to be provided) exhibits a rich combinatorial structure. We uncover sufficient conditions and necessary conditions for guaranteeing the existence of a stable solution, and derive both positive and negative results for strategyproof stable matching.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在没有货币转移的情境下，代理者和公共物品之间的匹配问题。由于物品是公共的，它们没有容量限制。没有外生定义的提供物品的预算。相反，每个提供的物品必须证明其成本，导致在物品的“偏好”中存在很强的互补性。此外，鉴于已提供的其他物品，那些需求量高的物品也必须得到提供。存在一个稳定解决方案（提供的公共物品的菜单）的问题展示了丰富的组合结构。我们揭示了保证存在稳定解决方案的充分条件和必要条件，并为无策略性稳定匹配得出了积极和消极的结果。",
