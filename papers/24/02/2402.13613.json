The primary objective of this shared task is to advance the field of natural language processing by developing techniques that proficiently extract comparative opinions from Vietnamese product reviews. Participants are challenged to propose models that adeptly extract a comparative \"quintuple\" from a comparative sentence, encompassing Subject, Object, Aspect, Predicate, and Comparison Type Label. We construct a human-annotated dataset comprising $120$ documents, encompassing $7427$ non-comparative sentences and $2468$ comparisons within $1798$ sentences. Participating models undergo evaluation and ranking based on the Exact match macro-averaged quintuple F1 score.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提供了越南语产品评论比较意见挖掘共享任务（ComOM）的综合概述，该任务作为第十届越南语言和语音处理国际研讨会（VLSP 2023）的一部分举行。此共享任务的主要目标是通过开发能够有效从越南产品评论中提取比较意见的技术来推动自然语言处理领域的发展。参与者被挑战提出能够从比较句中熟练提取比较“五元组”的模型，包括主题、客体、方面、谓词和比较类型标签。我们构建了一个包含120个文档的人工标记数据集，其中包括7427个非比较句和1798个句子中的2468个比较。参与的模型将根据准确匹配宏平均的五元组F1分数进行评估和排名。",
