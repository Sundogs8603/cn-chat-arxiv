    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了RevOrder，一种旨在改善大型语言模型中算术运算的新技术。该方法通过翻转加法、减法和n位数乘以1位数（nD乘以1D）的输出数字，显著降低了顺序中间数字的数量 (CSID)，这是我们引入的一种评估方程复杂性的新度量。通过全面的测试，RevOrder不仅在基本的算术运算中达到了完美的准确度，而且在除法任务中显著提升了语言模型的性能，特别是在传统模型难以处理的大数情况下。RevOrder的实现对于训练和推理阶段都具有成本效益。此外，将RevOrder应用于对GSM8K数学任务进行微调的LLaMA2-7B模型中，取得了显著的改善，将方程计算错误率降低了46%，将总体得分从41.6提升到44.4。",
