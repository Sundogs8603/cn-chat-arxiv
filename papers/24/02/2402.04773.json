    "abstract": "Along with the increasing frequency and severity of cyber incidents, understanding their economic implications is paramount. In this context, listed firms' reactions to cyber incidents are compelling to study since they (i) are a good proxy to estimate the costs borne by other organizations, (ii) have a critical position in the economy, and (iii) have their financial information publicly available. We extract listed firms' cyber incident dates and characteristics from newswire headlines. We use an event study over 2012--2022, using a three-day window around events and standard benchmarks. We find that the magnitude of abnormal returns around cyber incidents is on par with previous studies using newswire or alternative data to identify cyber incidents. Conversely, as we adjust the standard errors accounting for event-induced variance and residual cross-correlation, we find that the previously claimed significance of abnormal returns vanishes. Given these results, we run a horse race of ",

    "translated_abstract": "随着网络事件的频率和严重程度增加，了解其经济影响至关重要。在这个背景下，研究上市公司对网络事件的反应非常有意义，因为他们（i）可以作为估计其他组织承担成本的良好代理，（ii）在经济中处于关键位置，（iii）其财务信息公开可得。我们从新闻标题中提取上市公司的网络事件日期和特征。我们使用了一个事件研究来对2012年至2022年的数据进行分析，采用了对事件周围的三天时间窗口和标准基准。我们发现，围绕网络事件的异常收益的大小与使用新闻线索或其他数据来识别网络事件的先前研究相当。但是，当我们调整标准误差以考虑事件引起的方差和残差互相关时，我们发现先前宣称的异常收益的显著性消失了。基于这些结果，我们进行了一个“赛马”比赛。",
