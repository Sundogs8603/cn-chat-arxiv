The objective here is to learn a \"cascade\" of models, starting with lower-capacity models (such as logistic regressors) and ending with a powerful LLM, along with a deferral policy that determines the model that is used on a given input. We formulate the task of learning cascades online as an imitation-learning problem and give a no-regret algorithm for the problem. Experimental results across four benchmarks show that our method parallels LLMs in accuracy while cutting down inference costs by as much as 90%, underscoring its efficacy and adaptability in stream processing.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型 (LLM) 在回答关于数据流的复杂查询方面具有天然的优势，但是 LLM 推理的高计算成本使得它们在许多任务中不可行。我们提出了在线级联学习，这是首个解决这一挑战的方法。这里的目标是学习一个“级联”模型，从容量较低的模型（如逻辑回归器）开始，到强大的 LLM 结束，并配备一个决定在给定输入上使用哪个模型的推迟策略。我们将在线学习级联的任务公式化为一个模仿学习问题，并为该问题提供了无遗憾算法。在四个基准测试中的实验结果显示，我们的方法在准确性上与 LLM 相当，同时将推理成本削减了多达 90%，突显了它在流处理中的效能和适应能力。",
