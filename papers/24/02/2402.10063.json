    "translated_abstract": "类增量学习（CIL）是实现通用人工智能的一个实际且具有挑战性的问题。最近，预训练模型（PTMs）在视觉和自然语言处理任务中取得了突破。尽管最近的研究显示了PTMs顺序学习的潜力，但大量工作表明了缓解PTMs灾难性遗忘的必要性。通过一个初步研究和CIL的因果分析，我们揭示了问题的关键在于新旧数据之间的不平衡因果效应。具体而言，新数据促使模型适应新类别，同时阻碍了对旧类别的适应。同样，旧数据促使模型适应旧类别，同时阻碍了对新类别的适应。换句话说，从因果的角度来看，新旧类别之间的适应过程存在冲突。为了缓解这个问题，我们提出了“平衡因果效应”（BCE）的方法。",
