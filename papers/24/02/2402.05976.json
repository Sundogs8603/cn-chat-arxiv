    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种名为Ranksum的方法，用于基于排名融合的无监督单文档抽取式文本摘要。该方法利用为每个句子提取的四个多维度句子特征进行句子显著性排名：主题信息、语义内容、重要关键词和位置。Ranksum根据每个特征生成的句子显著性排名进行加权融合，以确定句子的重要性排名。融合权重是完全无监督生成的，需要标记的文档集合来学习融合权重。我们发现融合权重可以推广到其他数据集，因此将Ranksum视为一种无监督方法。为了确定主题排名，我们使用概率主题模型，而使用句子嵌入来捕捉语义信息。使用句子嵌入来生成排名时，我们利用连体网络产生抽象化的句子表示，然后形成排名。",
