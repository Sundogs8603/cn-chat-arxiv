    "translated_abstract": "神经网络成功地捕捉到了人脑在许多任务中的计算能力。受到大脑结构的启发，最近邻（NN）表示法是一种新的计算方法。我们在NN表示法与神经网络之间建立了更牢固的对应关系。虽然已知如何使用NN表示法表示单个神经元，但对于小规模深度神经网络尚无结果。具体地，针对深度为2的阈值电路，我们提供了其NN表示的明确构造，并给出了表示所需位数的明确界限。示例函数包括凸多面体的NN表示（阈值门的AND）、IP2、阈值门的OR以及线性或精确决策列表。",
    "tldr": "该论文介绍了一种受大脑结构启发的新的计算方法——最近邻表示法，通过建立与神经网络的对应关系和明确的构造，可以表示深度为2的阈值电路等不同函数。",
    "en_tdlr": "The paper presents a novel computation approach called Nearest Neighbor (NN) representations, which is inspired by the brain architecture. By establishing a correspondence between NN representations and neural networks and providing explicit constructions, the paper shows how to represent different functions, such as depth-2 threshold circuits, using NN representations."
