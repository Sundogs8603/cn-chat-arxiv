    "translated_abstract": "近期，基于图信号处理（GSP）的推荐算法因其高效性而备受关注。然而，这些方法未考虑到反映用户/物品特征的各种交互的重要性，并未利用用户和物品的高阶邻域信息来建模用户偏好，从而导致子优性能。为解决上述问题，我们提出了一种面向协同过滤的频率感知图信号处理方法（FaGSP）。首先，我们设计了一个级联滤波模块，由理想的高通滤波器和理想的低通滤波器组成，以连续的方式捕获独特和共同的用户/物品特征，更准确地建模用户偏好。然后，我们设计了一个并行滤波模块，由两个低通滤波器组成，可以轻松捕获邻域的层次结构，以更准确地利用用户/物品的高阶邻域信息进行用户预测。",
