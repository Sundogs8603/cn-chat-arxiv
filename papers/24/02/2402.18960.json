    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.18960v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Deep learning has shown to have great potential in medical applications. In critical domains as such, it is of high interest to have trustworthy algorithms which are able to tell when reliable assessments cannot be guaranteed. Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is a crucial step towards building a safe classifier. Following a previous study, showing that it is possible to classify breast cancer in point-of-care ultrasound images, this study investigates OOD detection using three different methods: softmax, energy score and deep ensembles. All methods are tested on three different OOD data sets. The results show that the energy score method outperforms the softmax method, performing well on two of the data sets. The ensemble method is the most robust, performing the best at detecting OOD samples for all three OOD data sets.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习在医学应用中展现了巨大潜力。在这样的关键领域中，拥有可以判断何时无法提供可靠评估的可信算法至关重要。检测越区（OOD）样本是构建安全分类器的关键步骤。本研究跟随之前的一项研究，展示了在便携式超声图像中可以对乳腺癌进行分类，探讨了使用三种不同方法进行OOD检测：softmax、能量分数和深度集成。所有方法都在三个不同的OOD数据集上进行了测试。结果显示能量分数方法优于softmax方法，在两个数据集上表现良好。集成方法最为稳健，在所有三个OOD数据集上最擅长检测OOD样本。",
