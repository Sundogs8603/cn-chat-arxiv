    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们介绍了HoughToRadon变换层，这是一种新颖的层，旨在改进与Hough变换相结合的神经网络的速度，以解决语义图像分割问题。通过在Hough变换层之后放置该层，“内部”卷积可以接收到具有新的有益属性的修改特征图，如较小的图像处理区域和参数空间与角度和偏移的线性性。这些属性在单独使用Hough变换时是不具备的。此外，HoughToRadon变换层允许我们使用两个新参数调整中间特征图的大小，从而使我们能够平衡结果神经网络的速度和质量。我们在开放的MIDV-500数据集上的实验证明，这种新方法在文档分割任务中节省了时间，并实现了97.7％的最新准确率，优于计算复杂度更大的HoughEncoder。",
