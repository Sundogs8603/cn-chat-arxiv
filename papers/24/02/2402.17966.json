    "translated_abstract": "操作性天气预报系统依赖于计算昂贵的基于物理的模型。尽管基于Transformer的模型在天气预测中显示出了显著潜力，但Transformers是离散模型，限制了其学习动态天气系统连续时空特征的能力。我们通过Conformer解决了这个问题，这是一种用于天气预测的时空连续视觉Transformer。Conformer旨在通过在多头注意力机制中实现连续性来学习时间上的连续天气演变。注意力机制被编码为Transformer架构中的可微分函数，以建模复杂的天气动态。我们将Conformer与最先进的数值天气预报（NWP）模型和几种基于深度学习的天气预测模型进行了评估。Conformer在所有前导时间上优于一些现有的数据驱动模型",
