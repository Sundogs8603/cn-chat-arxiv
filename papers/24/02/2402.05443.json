    "translated_abstract": "Wasserstein渐变流（WGF）描述了Wasserstein空间中概率密度的梯度动力学。WGF提供了在概率分布上进行优化的有希望的方法。数值上近似连续的WGF需要时间离散化方法。其中最著名的方法是JKO方案。在这方面，以前的WGF模型采用JKO方案，并为每个JKO步骤参数化传输映射。然而，这种方法导致了与JKO步骤数量K成二次增长的训练复杂性$O(K^2)$。这严重限制了WGF模型的可扩展性。在本文中，我们介绍了一种可扩展的基于WGF的生成模型，称为半对偶JKO（S-JKO）。我们的模型基于JKO步骤的半对偶形式，通过JKO步骤与不平衡最优输运之间的等价性得到。我们的方法将训练复杂性降低到$O(K)$。我们证明了我们的模型明显优于现有的基于WGF的生成模型。",
