We used the GRIT (Grid - and Region-based Image captioning Transformer) model to accomplish this work. GRIT is a Transformer-only neural architecture that effectively utilizes two visual features to generate better captions. The GRIT method emerged as a proposal to be a more efficient way to generate image captioning. In this work, we adapt the GRIT model to be trained in a Brazilian Portuguese dataset to have an image captioning method for the Brazilian Portuguese Language.",
