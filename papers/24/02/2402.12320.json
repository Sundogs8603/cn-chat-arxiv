The proposed strategy implements landmark recognition using the Yolov5 model and landmark distance estimation using an efficient Stereo Matching Algorithm. We consider that a moving node carrying a low-power mobile device facilitated with a calibrated stereo vision camera that captures stereo images of a scene containing landmarks within the battlefield region whose locations are stored in an offline server residing within the device itself. We created a custom landmark image dataset called MSTLandmarkv1 with 34 landmark classes and another landmark stereo dataset of those 34 landmark instances called MSTLandmarkSt",
