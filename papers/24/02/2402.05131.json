    "translated_abstract": "切块信息是检索增强生成(RAG)的关键步骤。目前的研究主要集中在段落级切块上。这种方法将所有文本都视为平等的，并忽略了文档结构中包含的信息。我们提出了一种扩展的方法，通过不仅仅将文档切块到段落级别，而是根据文档的结构元素组件来切块。将文档分解为这些组成元素可以创建一种新的文档切块方式，可以得到最佳的切块大小，无需调整。我们引入了一种新颖的框架，评估根据由文档理解模型注释的元素类型进行切块如何对所检索信息的整体上下文和准确性贡献。我们还演示了这种方法对RAG辅助问答任务性能的影响。我们的研究包括对各种元素类型的全面分析，它们在有效信息检索中的作用以及它们对其产生的影响。",
