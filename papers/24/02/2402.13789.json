Given potential shifts in demand patterns following the global health crisis, this study explores possible long-term structural changes in the seasonality of Brazilian airfare. We analyze an open dataset of domestic city pairs from 2013 to 2023, employing an econometric model developed using Stata software. Our findings indicate alterations in seasonal patterns and long-term trends in the post-pandemic era. These changes underscore potential shifts in the composition of leisure and business travelers, along with the cost pressures faced by airlines.",
