    "translated_abstract": "让机器人能够遵循复杂的自然语言指令是一个重要但具有挑战性的问题。人们希望在指导机器人时能够灵活表达约束，指向任意地标并验证行为。相反，机器人必须将人类指令消除歧义，将指令参照物联系到真实世界中。我们提出了一种名为语言指令地面化运动规划（LIMP）的系统，该系统利用基础模型和时间逻辑生成指令条件的语义地图，使机器人能够可验证地遵循富有表现力和长期的指令，涵盖了开放词汇参照和复杂的时空约束。与先前在机器人任务执行中使用基础模型的方法相比，LIMP构建了一个可解释的指令表示，揭示了机器人与指导者预期动机的一致性，并实现了机器人行为的综合。",
