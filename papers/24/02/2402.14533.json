However, it is unclear whether LLMs tend to exhibit distinctive linguistic styles akin to how human authors do. Through a comprehensive linguistic analysis, we compare the vocabulary, Part-Of-Speech (POS) distribution, dependency distribution, and sentiment of texts generated by three of the most popular LLMS today (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard) to diverse inputs. The results point to significant linguistic variations which, in turn, enable us to attribute a given text to its LLM origin with a favorable 88\\% accuracy using a simple off-the-shelf classification model. Theoretical and practical implications of this intriguing finding are discussed.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）能够生成与或超越人类质量相似的文本。然而，LLMs是否倾向于表现出类似于人类作者的独特语言风格尚不清楚。通过全面的语言分析，我们比较了由当今最流行的三种LLMs（GPT-3.5、GPT-4和Bard）生成的文本的词汇、词性分布、依赖分布和情感与多样输入。结果显示出显著的语言变化，进而使我们能够使用简单的现成分类模型以88%的准确率将给定文本归因于其LLM来源。讨论了这一有趣发现的理论和实践影响。",
