The rise of Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) recommendation systems, noted for their flexibility and ease of access for customer vendors, marks a significant trend.

The intricacy of C2C recommendation systems is further accentuated by the dual roles users assume as both sellers and buyers, introducing a spectrum of less uniform and varied inputs.

    "translated_abstract": "在不断发展的电子商务领域中，推荐系统至关重要地塑造了用户体验和参与度。消费者对消费者（C2C）推荐系统的崛起，以其灵活性和为客户供应商提供易于访问的特点，标志着一个重要趋势。然而，学术关注主要集中在商家对消费者（B2C）模型上，留下了一个空白，即缺乏物品属性、用户多样性和规模的C2C推荐数据集。C2C推荐系统的复杂性进一步突出了用户扮演卖家和买家两种角色的双重性质，引入了一系列不那么统一和多样化的输入。为解决这一问题，我们引入了MerRec，这是第一个专门用于C2C推荐的大规模数据集，源自Mercari电子商务平台，覆盖了2023年6个月内数百万用户和产品。MerRec不仅包括标准特征，如user_id、item_id和session_id",
