    "translated_abstract": "最近对患者特定胸部手术规划和仿真的兴趣日益增长，需要从自动医学图像分割算法中高效、稳健地创建数字解剖模型。深度学习(DL)现在是各种放射学任务的最先进技术，而U-shaped DL模型在医学图像分割方面表现出色，自2D UNet以来就一直如此。迄今为止，通过整合不同的注意力机制和网络配置，已经提出了许多U-shaped模型的变体。借助最近大型多标签数据库的发展，对这些模型的系统基准研究可以为临床部署和未来模型设计提供宝贵的见解，但此类研究仍然很少。我们进行了针对3D U-shaped模型(3DUNet、STUNet、AttentionUNet、SwinUNETR、FocalSegNet和一种新的具有四个变体的3D SwinUnet)的第一项基准研究，重点是基于CT的胸部解剖分割。",
