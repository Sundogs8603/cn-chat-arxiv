    "abstract": "The number of air transportation passengers during the holidays in Brazil has grown notably since the late nineties. One of the reasons is greater competition in airfares made possible by economic liberalization. This paper presents an econometric model of airline pricing aiming at estimating the impacts of holiday periods on fares, with special emphasis on three-day holiday events. It makes use of a database with daily collected data from the internet between 2008 and 2010 for the major Brazilian city, Sao Paulo. The econometric panel data model employs a two-way error components \"within\" estimator, controlling for airline/airport-pair fixed effect along with quotation and departure months effects. The decomposition of time effects between quotation and departure month effects is the main methodological contribution of the paper. Results allow for a comparative analysis of the performance of Sao Paulo's downtown and international airports - respectively, Congonhas (CGH), and Guarulhos",

    "translated_abstract": "自上世纪90年代末以来，巴西假期期间的航空旅客数量显著增长。其中一个原因是经济自由化带来的航空票价竞争加剧。本文提出了一个航空公司定价的计量经济模型，旨在估计假期对票价的影响，特别强调了三天假期活动。它利用了一个数据库，该数据库收集了2008年至2010年期间巴西主要城市圣保罗的互联网每天的数据。经济面板数据模型采用了两个错误成份的“内部”估计器，控制了航空公司/机场对和报价和出发月份的影响。时间效应在报价和出发月份之间的分解是本文的主要方法贡献。结果允许对圣保罗市中心和国际机场（分别为CGH和Guarulhos）的性能进行比较分析。",
