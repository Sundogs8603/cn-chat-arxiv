We develop a novel SVRP formulation that accounts for uncertain travel costs and demands, alongside specific customer time windows. An attention-based neural network trained through reinforcement learning is employed to minimize routing costs. Our approach addresses a gap in SVRP research, which traditionally relies on heuristic methods, by leveraging machine learning. The model outperforms the Ant-Colony Optimization algorithm, achieving a 1.73% reduction in travel costs. It uniquely integrates external information, demonstrating robustness in diverse environments, making it a valuable benchmark for future SVRP studies and industry application.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种利用强化学习来优化具有时间窗口的随机车辆路径问题（SVRP）的方法，重点是减少货物配送中的旅行成本。我们提出了一种新颖的SVRP模型，考虑了不确定的旅行成本和需求，同时考虑了具体的客户的时间窗口。通过强化学习训练的注意力机制神经网络被用来最小化路径成本。我们的方法填补了SVRP研究中的空白，传统上依赖于启发式方法，而是利用机器学习。该模型在旅行成本上胜过了蚁群算法，实现了1.73%的降低。它独特地整合了外部信息，在不同环境中表现出鲁棒性，成为未来SVRP研究和行业应用的有价值的基准。",
