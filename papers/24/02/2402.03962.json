    "translated_abstract": "人类有一种倾向，看到周围的物体具有类似\"人类\"的特质。我们给汽车取名字，和宠物甚至家用电器交谈，仿佛它们能像其他人类一样理解我们。这种行为被称为拟人化，在机器学习（ML）领域也越来越受到关注，人们声称在大型语言模型（LLM）中能够察觉到类似于人类智能的特质。在这篇位置论文中，考虑到专业激励、人类偏见和一般方法论设置，我们讨论如何当前对于人工通用智能（AGI）的追求为将类人特质归因于LLM打开了滥觞之门。通过几个实验，我们证明在潜在空间中发现可解释为人类的模式并不应该是令人惊讶的结果。考虑到媒体对人工智能的普遍描写，我们呼吁学术界特别谨慎，并对学术诚信原则有额外的意识，在解读和传播关于AI研究的信息时要保持谨慎。",
