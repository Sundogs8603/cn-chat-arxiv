We examine the problem posed by masquerading samples; that is samples crafted by bad actors to be similar or near identical to legitimate samples. We find that these samples potentially create significant problems for machine learning solutions.

We then examine the interplay between digital signatures and machine learning solutions. In particular, we focus on executable files and code signing. We offer a taxonomy for masquerading files. We use a combination of similarity and clustering to find masquerading files. We use the insights gathered in this process to offer improvements to similarity based and machine learning security solutions.",

    "translated_abstract": "相似性已经应用于广泛的安全应用领域，通常用于机器学习模型。我们研究了由坏演员制作的伪装样本所提出的问题; 这些样本被制作得与合法样本相似或接近相同。我们发现这些样本可能会给机器学习解决方案带来重大问题。主要问题在于，坏演员可以通过使用伪装样本绕过机器学习解决方案。然后，我们研究了数字签名和机器学习解决方案之间的相互作用。特别是，我们专注于可执行文件和代码签名。我们提供了伪装文件的分类法。我们使用相似性和聚类的组合来查找伪装文件。我们利用在这个过程中收集到的见解来改进基于相似性和机器学习的安全解决方案。",
