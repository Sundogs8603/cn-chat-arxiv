    "abstract": "Adapting driving behavior to new environments, customs, and laws is a long-standing problem in autonomous driving, precluding the widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In this paper, we present LLaDA, a simple yet powerful tool that enables human drivers and autonomous vehicles alike to drive everywhere by adapting their tasks and motion plans to traffic rules in new locations. LLaDA achieves this by leveraging the impressive zero-shot generalizability of large language models (LLMs) in interpreting the traffic rules in the local driver handbook. Through an extensive user study, we show that LLaDA's instructions are useful in disambiguating in-the-wild unexpected situations. We also demonstrate LLaDA's ability to adapt AV motion planning policies in real-world datasets; LLaDA outperforms baseline planning approaches on all our metrics.

    "translated_abstract": "自动驾驶中，将驾驶行为适应新环境、习俗和法律是一个长期存在的问题，这限制了自动驾驶车辆(AVs)的广泛部署。本文介绍了LLaDA，一种简单而强大的工具，可以使人类驾驶员和自动驾驶车辆都能在各处行驶，通过将任务和运动计划调整到新位置的交通规则。LLaDA利用大型语言模型(LLMs)在解释本地驾驶手册中的交通规则时具有令人印象深刻的零-shot泛化能力。通过广泛的用户研究，我们展示了LLaDA的指导在解决现实世界中的意外情况时的有用性。我们还展示了LLaDA在真实世界数据集中调整AV运动计划策略的能力；LLaDA在所有指标上优于基线规划方法。请访问我们的网站了解更多详细信息：https://boyiliee.github.io/llada.",
