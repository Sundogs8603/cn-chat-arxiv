    "translated_abstract": "本文首次提出了Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP)任务，用于根据用户以自然语言描述的请求直接生成行程。OUIP与传统行程规划不同，传统规划限制了用户表达更详细的需求，阻碍了真正的个性化。最近，大型语言模型(LLM)在处理多样化任务方面表现出潜力。然而，由于非实时信息、不完整的知识和不足的空间意识，它们无法独立地提供满意的用户体验。鉴于此，我们提出了一个名为ItiNera的OUIP系统，将空间优化与大型语言模型(LLM)相结合，根据用户需求提供个性化的城市行程定制服务。具体来说，我们开发了一个基于LLM的流水线，用于提取和更新兴趣点特征，以创建用户自己的个性化兴趣点数据库。对于每个用户请求，我们利用LLM进行协同实现优化。",
