However, legal documents are often challenging to understand for people without legal backgrounds. In this paper, we present a novel application of large language models (LLMs) in legal education to help non-experts learn intricate legal concepts through storytelling, an effective pedagogical tool in conveying complex and abstract concepts. We also introduce a new dataset LegalStories, which consists of 295 complex legal doctrines, each accompanied by a story and a set of multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs. To construct the dataset, we experiment with various LLMs to generate legal stories explaining these concepts. Furthermore, we use an expert-in-the-loop method to iteratively design multiple-choice questions. Then, we evaluate the effectiveness of storytelling with LLMs through an ",

    "translated_abstract": "将法律知识变得更容易理解对于提升普通法律素养和鼓励公民参与民主至关重要。然而，对于没有法律背景的人来说，法律文件通常难以理解。本文提出了一种新颖的大型语言模型（LLMs）在法律教育中的应用，帮助非专业人士通过讲故事学习复杂的法律概念，讲故事是传达复杂和抽象概念的有效教学工具。我们还介绍了一个名为LegalStories的新数据集，其中包含295个复杂的法律原则，每个原则都附有一个故事和一组由LLMs生成的多项选择题。为了构建数据集，我们尝试使用各种LLMs生成解释这些概念的法律故事。此外，我们使用专家参与的方法来迭代设计多项选择题。然后，我们通过一",
