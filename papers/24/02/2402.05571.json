    "abstract": "Background: Eating disorders are increasingly prevalent, and social networks offer valuable information.   Objective: Our goal was to identify efficient machine learning models for categorizing tweets related to eating disorders.   Methods: Over three months, we collected tweets about eating disorders. A 2,000-tweet subset was labeled for: (1) being written by individuals with eating disorders, (2) promoting eating disorders, (3) informativeness, and (4) scientific content. Both traditional machine learning and deep learning models were employed for classification, assessing accuracy, F1 score, and computational time.   Results: From 1,058,957 collected tweets, transformer-based bidirectional encoder representations achieved the highest F1 scores (71.1%-86.4%) across all four categories.   Conclusions: Transformer-based models outperform traditional techniques in classifying eating disorder-related tweets, though they require more computational resources.",
