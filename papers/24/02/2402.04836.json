    "translated_abstract": "不变模型是一类重要的几何深度学习模型，通过利用信息丰富的几何特征生成有意义的几何表示。这些模型以其简单性、良好的实验结果和计算效率而闻名。然而，它们的理论表达能力仍然不清楚，限制了对这种模型潜力的深入理解。在这项工作中，我们集中讨论不变模型的理论表达能力。我们首先严格限制了最经典的不变模型Vanilla DisGNN（结合距离的消息传递神经网络）的表达能力，将其不可识别的情况仅限于高度对称的几何图形。为了打破这些特殊情况的对称性，我们引入了一个简单而完备的不变设计，即嵌套Vanilla DisGNN的GeoNGNN。利用GeoNGNN作为理论工具，我们首次证明了E(3)-完备性。",
