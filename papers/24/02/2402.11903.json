    "translated_abstract": "针对大型语言模型（LLMs）在逻辑推理上面临的挑战，先前的努力试图通过工具学习来改变问题求解。虽然在小规模问题上已经取得了进展，但由于规模庞大且表达复杂，解决工业案例仍然困难。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的求解层适应（SoLA）方法，我们在LLM中引入了一个求解器作为新层，不同地引导解决方案朝向可满足性。在SoLA中，LLM旨在理解自然语言描述的搜索空间，并识别最高质量的局部解，而求解器层则专注于初始解不满足的约束条件。借助MaxSAT作为桥梁，我们定义了前向和后向传递梯度，使最终模型能够收敛到一个满足的解或证明不可满足性。后门理论确保SoLA能够获得准确性",
