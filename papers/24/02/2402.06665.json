    "translated_abstract": "最近在基础模型中取得的进展，尤其是在大型多模态模型和对话代理方面，引发了对具备普遍能力的具身代理人潜力的兴趣。这样的代理人需要能够在许多不同的真实世界环境中执行新任务。然而，当前的基础模型未能准确建模与现实世界的物理相互作用，因此对于具身人工智能而言是不够的。因果关系的研究有助于构建真实世界模型，这对于准确预测可能相互作用的结果至关重要。本文着重探讨了为即将到来的具身代理生成基础世界模型的前景，并对其中的因果关系的重要性提出了新的观点。我们认为整合因果关系是促进与世界的有意义的物理相互作用至关重要的。最后，我们揭示了这一背景下对因果关系的误解，并展示了我们对未来的展望。",
