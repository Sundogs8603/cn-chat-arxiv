    "translated_abstract": "人类智能似乎如此神秘，以至于我们直到现在都没有成功理解它的基础。在这里，我想介绍一种基本的认知过程，即运动映射认知（MMC），它应该是人类视觉中不可分解的主要功能。在其中，我指出，MMC过程可以用来解释大多数人类视觉功能的基本问题，但无法通过传统的视觉处理方式（包括图像分割、物体识别和物体跟踪等）有效建模。此外，我还提出MMC可以视为陈的拓扑知觉理论在人类视觉上的延伸，并且似乎无法通过现有的智能算法技巧来解决。最后，结合对MMC问题的需求，可以通过发展最优传输理论的思想来推导出一个有趣的计算模型，即量化的拓扑匹配原则。以上结果可能给我们开发更加稳健和可解释的机器视觉方法提供了巨大的启发。",
