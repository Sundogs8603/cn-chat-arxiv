    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了一种完全自动的脑肿瘤分割和分类模型，使用了包括多尺度方法在内的深度卷积神经网络。我们的方法与之前的工作的一个区别是输入图像在不同处理路径上以三个空间尺度进行处理。这个机制是受到人类视觉系统的内在操作的启示。提出的神经模型可以分析包含三种类型肿瘤（脑膜瘤、胶质瘤和垂体瘤）的MRI图像，包括矢状面、冠状面和轴面，并且不需要预处理输入图像事先移除头骨或椎骨部分。我们的方法在一个公开可用的包含233名患者3064张切片的MRI图像数据集上的性能与之前的经典机器学习和深度学习方法进行了比较。在比较中，我们的方法明显地获得了0.973的肿瘤分类准确率，高于其他方法。",
