    "translated_abstract": "面部动作单元（AU）检测的主要方法涉及监督的多标签二进制分类问题。现有的方法常常对AU的像素级信息进行编码，从而对模型的复杂性和表达能力提出了很大的要求。此外，由于存在噪声AU标签，这种做法增加了过拟合的风险。在本研究中，我们引入了一个对比学习框架，通过监督和自监督信号增强。目标是在AU检测领域中摆脱传统的像素级学习范式，获得判别特征。为了应对噪声AU标签带来的挑战，我们通过引入自监督信号来增强监督信号。这种增强是通过正样本抽样实现的，包括三种不同类型的正样本对。另外，为了减轻每个AU类型的分布不平衡问题，我们采用了一种权衡重要性的损失函数。",
