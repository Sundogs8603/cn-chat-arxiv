    "translated_abstract": "最近，Bilevel优化已被应用于许多机器学习任务中。然而，它们的应用仅限于监督学习设置，其中考虑了具有良性结构的静态目标函数。但是，激励设计、反向强化学习(RL)和来自人类反馈的RLHF等Bilevel问题通常被建模为超越简单静态目标结构的动态目标函数，这给使用现有Bilevel解决方案带来了重大挑战。为了解决这一新的Bilevel问题类别，我们通过惩罚形式引入了解决Bilevel RL问题的第一个原则性算法框架。我们通过理论研究问题的景观及其基于惩罚的（策略）梯度算法进行了验证。我们通过在Stackelberg马尔可夫博弈、来自人类反馈的RL和激励设计中进行模拟来证明我们算法的有效性。",
