    "abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models have reached state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. However, the progress in the field of graph reasoning remains limited. Our work delves into this gap by thoroughly investigating graph reasoning with LLM. In this work, we reveal the impact of text sequence on LLM spatial understanding, finding that graph-descriptive text sequences significantly affect LLM reasoning performance on graphs. By altering the graph-descriptive text sequences, we enhance the performance of LLM from 42.22\\% to 70\\%. Furthermore, we evaluate the relationship between LLM performance and graph size, discovering that the reasoning performance of LLM does not monotonically decrease with the increase in graph size. Conclusively, we introduce the Scaled Graph Reasoning benchmark for assessing LLM performance across varied graph sizes.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，大语言模型在多个领域达到了最先进的性能。然而，图推理领域的进展仍然有限。我们的工作深入研究了大语言模型的图推理。在这项工作中，我们揭示了文本顺序对大语言模型空间理解的影响，发现图描述的文本顺序显著影响大语言模型对图的推理性能。通过改变图描述的文本顺序，我们将大语言模型的性能从42.22％提高到70％。此外，我们评估了大语言模型性能和图大小之间的关系，发现大语言模型的推理性能不随图大小的增加而单调递减。最后，我们引入了规模化图推理基准来评估大语言模型在不同图大小上的性能。",
