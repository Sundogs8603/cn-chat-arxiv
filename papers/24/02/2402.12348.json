    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLMs）被整合到关键的现实世界应用中，它们的战略和逻辑推理能力变得越来越关键。本文通过博弈论任务评估LLMs在竞争环境中的推理能力，例如，需要纯逻辑和战略推理来与对手竞争的棋盘游戏和纸牌游戏。我们首先提出了GTBench，这是一个以语言驱动的环境，包括10个广泛认可的任务，涵盖了全面的游戏分类法：完整信息与不完整信息，动态与静态，以及概率与确定性场景。然后，我们研究了两个关键问题：（1）表征LLMs的博弈论推理；（2）LLM对抗LLM的比赛作为推理评估。我们观察到（1）LLMs在各种游戏场景下有不同的行为；例如，LLMs在完整和确定性游戏中失败，但它们在概率游戏中具有竞争力。",
