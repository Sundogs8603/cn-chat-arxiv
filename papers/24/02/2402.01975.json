    "translated_abstract": "一个分子的2D表示由其原子、原子属性和分子的共价键组成。分子的3D（几何）表示称为构型，由其原子类型和笛卡尔坐标组成。每个构型都具有潜在能量，能量越低，其在自然界中出现的可能性越大。大多数现有的分子性质预测的机器学习方法要么只考虑2D分子图，要么只考虑3D构型结构表示。受到最近关于在2D图表示和构型集合中使用集成的研究启发，我们提出了E(3) 不变性分子构型聚合网络。该方法将分子的2D表示与其多个构型的表示整合在一起。与以往的研究相反，我们提出了一种基于可微分求解器的新型2D-3D聚合机制，用于融合Gromov-Wasserstein变量问题，并使用高效的在线构型生成方法。",
