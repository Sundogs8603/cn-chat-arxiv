    "translated_abstract": "联合学习（FL）是物联网中一种有前景的机器学习方法，但在IoT设备数量增加时，必须解决网络拥塞问题。分层联合学习（HFL）通过将模型聚合分配给多个边缘服务器来缓解这个问题。然而，通信开销仍然是一个挑战，特别是在所有IoT设备同时参与训练过程的情况下。为了可扩展性，实际的HFL方案选择一部分IoT设备参与训练，因此引入了设备调度的概念。在此设置中，只有选择的IoT设备被安排参与全局训练，每个设备被分配给一个边缘服务器。现有的HFL分配方法主要基于搜索机制，这些机制在寻找最优分配时存在高延迟的问题。本文提出了一种改进的K-Center算法用于设备调度，并引入了基于深度强化学习的方法。",
