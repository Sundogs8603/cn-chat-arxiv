Integrating universal data synthesis methods holds promise in improving generalization. However, current methods cannot guarantee that the generator's output covers all unseen real data. In this paper, we introduce InfoBoost -- a highly versatile cross-domain data synthesizing framework with time series representation learning capability. We have developed a method based on synthetic data that enables model training without the need for real data, surpassing the performance of models trained with real data. Additionally, we have trained a universal feature extractor based on our synthetic data that is applicable to all time-series data.
