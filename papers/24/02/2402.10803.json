    "translated_abstract": "构建在之前的基础工作（Lussange等人，2020年）之上，本研究引入了一种多智能体强化学习（MARL）模型，模拟加密货币市场，该模型校准为 2018 年至 2022 年间不间断交易的 Binance 的153种加密货币的每日收盘价。与先前依赖于零智能代理或单个自主智能体方法的代理基础模型（ABM）或多智能体系统（MAS）不同，我们的方法依赖于赋予代理强化学习（RL）技术，以模拟加密市场。这种整合旨在通过自下而上的复杂性推理，模拟个体和集体代理，确保在这类市场近期波动剧烈且在 COVID-19 时代期间的稳健性。我们模型的一个关键特征还在于其自主代理根据两种信息源进行资产价格估值：",
