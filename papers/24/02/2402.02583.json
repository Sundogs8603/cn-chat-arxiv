In this paper, we propose DiffEditor to rectify two weaknesses in existing diffusion-based image editing: (1) in complex scenarios, editing results often lack editing accuracy and exhibit unexpected artifacts; (2) lack of flexibility to harmonize editing operations, e.g., imagine new content. In our solution, we introduce image prompts in fine-grained image editing, cooperating with the text prompt to better describe the editing content. To increase the flexibility while maintaining content consistency, we locally combine stochastic differential equation (SDE) into the ordinary differential equation (ODE) sampling.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，大规模的文本到图像扩散模型已经在图像生成领域取得了革命性的进展。尽管具备多样且高质量的生成能力，但将这些能力应用于细粒度图像编辑仍然具有挑战性。本文中，我们提出了DiffEditor来改善现有扩散式图像编辑中存在的两个问题：（1）在复杂场景中，编辑结果通常缺乏编辑准确性并且会出现意外的伪影；（2）缺乏灵活性以协调编辑操作，例如引入新的内容。我们的解决方案是在细粒度图像编辑中引入图像提示，与文本提示一起更好地描述编辑内容。为了增加灵活性同时保持内容的一致性，我们将随机微分方程（SDE）局部结合到常微分方程（ODE）采样中。此外，我们还将基于区域得分的梯度引导和时间旅行策略结合到扩散采样中。",
