    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究已经引入了机器学习框架来增强混合整数线性规划(B\\&B)的分支策略。这些方法主要依赖于强分支的模仿学习，并展现了卓越的性能。然而，收集用于模仿学习的专家样本，特别是用于强分支的样本，是一项耗时的任务。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了CAMBranch: 基于增强MILP的对比学习用于分支的框架，通过对有限数量的来自原始MILP的专家数据应用变量转移来生成增强MILP (AMILP)。这种方法可以获取大量标记的专家样本。CAMBranch利用MILP和AMILP进行模仿学习，并采用对比学习来提高模型捕捉MILP特征的能力，从而提高分支决策的质量。",
