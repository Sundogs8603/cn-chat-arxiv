    "abstract": "Synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHR) have emerged as a pivotal tool in advancing healthcare applications and machine learning models, particularly for researchers without direct access to healthcare data. Although existing methods, like rule-based approaches and generative adversarial networks (GANs), generate synthetic data that resembles real-world EHR data, these methods often use a tabular format, disregarding temporal dependencies in patient histories and limiting data replication. Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) for EHR data. This enables applications like disease progression analysis, population estimation, counterfactual reasoning, and synthetic data generation. In this work, we focus on synthetic data generation and demonstrate the capability of training a GPT model using a particular patient representation derived from CEHR-BERT, enabling us to generate patient sequences that can be seamlessly converted ",

    "translated_abstract": "合成电子健康记录（EHR）已成为推进医疗应用和机器学习模型的关键工具，特别是对于没有直接访问医疗数据的研究人员而言。尽管现有方法，如基于规则的方法和生成对抗网络（GAN），可以生成类似真实世界EHR数据的合成数据，但这些方法常常使用表格格式，忽略了病人历史的时间依赖性，限制了数据复制。最近，越来越多的人开始利用生成预训练转换器（GPT）来处理EHR数据。这使得可以进行疾病进展分析、人口估计、反事实推理和合成数据生成等应用。本研究关注合成数据生成，并演示了使用源自CEHR-BERT的特定病人表示训练GPT模型的能力，从而能够生成可无缝转换的病人序列。",
