    "translated_abstract": "关于网络风险，有两个战略性且长期存在的问题，组织很难回答：组织的风险曝光是多少，安全与同行相比如何？回答这两个问题需要行业范围内的安全状况、事件和损失的数据，直到最近，这些数据对于组织来说过于敏感而无法共享。现在，隐私增强技术（PETs）如加密计算可以在保留敏感输入数据的同时，实现从同行组织中的汇总网络风险指标的安全计算。随着这些新的汇总数据的可用性，分析师需要将其融入网络风险模型中，以产生更可靠的风险评估并进行同行比较。本文提出了一个新的框架，通过使用安全计算产生的新变量，将网络状况与同行进行基准比较，估计特定经济部门的网络风险。",
