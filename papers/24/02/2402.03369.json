    "abstract": "This study examined the use of voice recognition technology in perioperative services (Periop) to enable Periop staff to record workflow milestones using mobile technology. The use of mobile technology to improve patient flow and quality of care could be facilitated if such voice recognition technology could be made robust. The goal of this experiment was to allow the Periop staff to provide care without being interrupted with data entry and querying tasks. However, the results are generalizable to other situations where an engineering manager attempts to improve communication performance using mobile technology. This study enhanced Google's voice recognition capability by using post-processing classifiers (i.e., bag-of-sentences, support vector machine, and maximum entropy). The experiments investigated three factors (original phrasing, reduced phrasing, and personalized phrasing) at three levels (zero training repetition, 5 training repetitions, and 10 training repetitions).

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了将语音识别技术应用于围手术期服务（Periop），以使Periop员工能够使用移动技术记录工作流程里程碑。如果能够使这种语音识别技术变得强大可靠，就可以通过使用移动技术改善患者流程和医疗质量。此实验的目标是使Periop员工能够提供无干扰的护理，而不需要进行数据录入和查询任务。然而，该研究的结果也适用于其他情况，即工程经理尝试使用移动技术改善通信性能。本研究通过使用后处理分类器（即句子包、支持向量机和最大熵）增强了谷歌的语音识别能力。实验研究了三个因素（原始措辞、简化措辞和个性化措辞）在三个水平（零次训练重复、5次训练重复和10次训练重复）的影响。",
