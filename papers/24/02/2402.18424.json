There are 7100+ active languages spoken around the world and building emotion classification for each language is labor intensive. Particularly for low-resource and endangered languages, building emotion classification can be quite challenging. We present a cross-lingual emotion classifier, where we train an emotion classifier with resource-rich languages (i.e. \\textit{English} in our work) and transfer the learning to low and moderate resource languages. We compare and contrast two approaches of transfer learning from a high-resource language to a low or moderate-resource language. One approach projects the annotation from a high-resource language to low and moderate-resource language in parallel corpora and the other one uses direct transfer from high-resource language to the other languages.

    "translated_abstract": "能够分析全球范围内人们情绪状态是很重要的。全球有7100多种活跃语言，为每种语言构建情感分类是一项劳动密集型工作。特别是对于低资源和濒危语言，建立情感分类可能非常具有挑战性。我们提出了一种跨语言情感分类器，我们在资源丰富的语言（例如我们的工作中的英语）上训练情感分类器，并将学习迁移到低资源和中等资源的语言。我们比较并对比了从高资源语言到低资源或中等资源语言的两种迁移学习方法。一种方法将高资源语言的标注投影到低资源和中等资源语言的平行语料库中，另一种方法直接将高资源语言的学习迁移到其他语言。我们展示了我们的方法在6种语言上的有效性：Fa",
