    "translated_abstract": "视觉语言模型 (VLM) 已经成为强大的工具，在处理图像识别、文本驱动的视觉内容生成、视觉聊天机器人等各种开放词汇任务上展现出了强大的能力。近年来，人们在提高 VLM 下游性能的适应方法上投入了大量的努力和资源，尤其是在参数高效的微调方法（如提示学习）上。然而，一个被大大忽视的关键问题是在微调的 VLM 中的置信度校准问题，在实际部署这样的模型时会大大降低可靠性。本文通过系统地研究提示学习背景下的置信度校准问题，发现现有的校准方法不能解决这个问题，尤其是在开放词汇的设置中。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种简单而有效的方法，称为 \"Distance-Aware Ca\"",
