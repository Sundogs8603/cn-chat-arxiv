While existing data valuation methods have proven effective in evaluating the value of Euclidean data, they face limitations when applied to the increasingly popular graph-structured data. Particularly, graph data valuation introduces unique challenges, primarily stemming from the intricate dependencies among nodes and the exponential growth in value estimation costs. To address the challenging problem of graph data valuation, we put forth an innovative solution, Precedence-Constrained Winter (PC-Winter) Value, to account for the complex graph structure. Furthermore, we develop a variety of strategies to address the computational challenges and enable efficient approximation of PC-Winter.

    "translated_abstract": "数据估值对于量化数据的价值、评估数据质量和确定公平补偿至关重要。现有的数据估值方法在评估欧几里德数据的价值方面已被证明有效，但在应用于越来越受欢迎的图形数据时存在局限性。特别是，图形数据估值引入了独特的挑战，主要源于节点之间复杂的依赖关系和价值估计成本的指数增长。为了解决图形数据估值的问题，我们提出了一种创新的解决方案，称为优先约束冬季价值(Precedence-Constrained Winter, PC-Winter)，以考虑复杂的图形结构。此外，我们还开发了多种策略来解决计算挑战，实现对PC-Winter的高效近似。大量的实验证明了PC-Winter在各种数据集和任务上的有效性。",
