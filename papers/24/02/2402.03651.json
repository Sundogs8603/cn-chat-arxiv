    "translated_abstract": "现实世界中的网络，随着其不断变化的关系，最能以时间图形式捕捉。然而，现有的软件库主要是针对静态图设计的，忽略了时间图的动态性质。为了填补这一空白，我们引入了TGX，这是一个专为分析时间网络而设计的Python软件包，包含了自动化的数据加载、数据处理和演化图分析的工作流程。TGX提供了11个内置数据集和8个外部时间图基准（TGB）数据集的访问，以及任何以.csv格式的新数据集。除了数据加载外，TGX还提供了数据处理功能，例如对时间图的离散化和节点子采样，以加速处理较大的数据集。为了全面的研究，TGX通过提供多样化的度量指标（如平均节点度和每个时间戳的节点和边的演化数量）以进行网络分析。此外，该软件包还整合了度量指标的计算及对图形进行可视化的功能。",
