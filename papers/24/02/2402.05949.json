    "translated_abstract": "在线客户数据为产品设计和市场研究提供了宝贵的信息，因为它可以揭示客户的喜好。然而，使用人工智能（AI）对这些数据进行数据驱动设计的分析是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为可能存在隐藏的模式。此外，在这些研究领域中，大多数研究仅限于发现客户的需求。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于博弈论机器学习（ML）方法，可以从在线评级的基础上选择、排序和组合最大化客户满意度的产品特性，从而提取全面的设计启示，用于产品开发的指导。然后，我们使用SHAP（SHapley Additive exPlanations）博弈论方法，根据其对预测的贡献为每个特征分配一个值，为评估每个特征对总体满意度的重要性提供指导。我们将该方法应用于来自Kaggle的笔记本电脑的真实数据集中。",
