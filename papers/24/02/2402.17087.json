A dataset of observations of the manifest variables allows us to quantify the parameters of the empirical Bayesian net.

    "translated_abstract": "我们表征了从具有潜在根节点的贝叶斯网络计算出的似然函数。我们展示了对于剩余的显性变量的边缘分布也会像一个贝叶斯网络一样分解，我们称之为经验化。一组观测到的显性变量的数据集使我们能够量化经验贝叶斯网络的参数。我们证明了(i)从原始贝叶斯网络计算出这样一个数据集的似然性由经验化模型的似然性的全局最大值所主导；以及(ii)这样一个最大值仅在贝叶斯网络的参数与经验模型的参数一致时才会达到。",
