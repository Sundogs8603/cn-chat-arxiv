    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing interest in the exploration of Nonlinear Matrix Decomposition (NMD) due to its close ties with neural networks. NMD aims to find a low-rank matrix from a sparse nonnegative matrix with a per-element nonlinear function. A typical choice is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. To address over-fitting in the existing ReLU-based NMD model (ReLU-NMD), we propose a Tikhonov regularized ReLU-NMD model, referred to as ReLU-NMD-T. Subsequently, we introduce a momentum accelerated algorithm for handling the ReLU-NMD-T model. A distinctive feature, setting our work apart from most existing studies, is the incorporation of both positive and negative momentum parameters in our algorithm.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，由于与神经网络的密切联系，人们对非线性矩阵分解（NMD）的探索日益增多。NMD旨在从稀疏的非负矩阵中找到一个低秩矩阵，其中每个元素都经过非线性函数，典型的选择是ReLU激活函数。为了解决现有的ReLU-NMD模型中的过拟合问题，我们提出了一种Tikhonov正则化的ReLU-NMD模型，称为ReLU-NMD-T。随后，我们引入了一种用于处理ReLU-NMD-T模型的动量加速算法。与大多数现有研究工作的一个显著特点是，我们的算法同时结合了正动量和负动量参数。我们对实际数据集进行的数值实验表明了所提出模型和算法的有效性。此外，代码可在https://github.com/nothing2wang/NMD-TM找到。",
