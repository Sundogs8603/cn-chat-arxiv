    "translated_abstract": "最近，受浸入边界方法启发的物理信息神经网络（PINNs），包括移动边界启用的 PINNs（MB-PINNs），已经显示出在经济翼非稳定流经过运动体时准确重建速度和恢复压力作为隐藏变量的能力。考虑到经济翼的流动，MB-PINNs 在全局物理损失放松和物理学基础下采样方法的影响下进行了训练，获得了良好的准确性。本研究的目的是通过物理损失放松和基于物理的下采样方法，调查哪个输入空间子域对训练有贡献。在 MB-PINNs 训练的背景下，定义了三个空间区域：运动体、尾迹和外部区域。为了量化哪个空间区域驱动了训练，从分区损失分量梯度统计和每个区域中样本点的比例计算了两个新的指标。",
