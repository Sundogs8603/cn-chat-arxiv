We address this challenge, by focusing on a construction pathway of skyrmionics metamaterial within a monolayer thin film and suggest several promising lattice-like, flakes-like, and cell-like skyrmionic metamaterials that are surprisingly stable. Central to our approach is the concept of 'simulated controlled assembly', in short, a protocol inspired by 'click chemistry' that allows for positioning topological magnetic structures where one likes, and then allowing for energy minimization to elucidate the stability. Utilizing high-throughput atomistic-spin-dynamic (ASD) simulations alongside state-of-the-art AI-driven tools, we have isolated skyrmions (topological charge Q=1), antiskyrmions (Q=-1), and skyrmionium (Q=0).
