    "translated_abstract": "我们在$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-差分隐私（DP）下对最坏组风险最小化进行了系统研究。目标是找到一个可以在$p$个具有不同分布的子人群（组）中近似最小化最大风险的私有模型，其中每个组的分布通过样本访问。我们首先提出了一种新算法，其实现的最坏组群体风险超出度为$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{p\\sqrt{d}}{K\\epsilon} + \\sqrt{\\frac{p}{K}})$，其中$K$是从所有组中抽取的样本的总数，$d$是问题维度。当每个分布通过大小为$K/p$的固定大小数据集观察时，我们的速率几乎是最优的。我们的结果基于对泛化误差的新稳定性分析。特别是，我们表明$\\Delta$-一致性参数稳定性意味着相对于最坏组风险的$\\tilde{O}(\\Delta + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$泛化误差，其中$n$是个数。",
