This is commonly done by maximising the Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) acquisitions function. However, we highlight that it is challenging to estimate BALD when the new data points are subject to censorship, where only clipped values of the targets are observed. To address this, we derive the entropy and the mutual information for censored distributions and derive the BALD objective for active learning in censored regression ($\\mathcal{C}$-BALD). We propose a novel modelling approach to estimate the $\\mathcal{C}$-BALD objective and use it for active learning in the censored setting. Across a wide range of datasets and models, we demonstrate that $\\mathcal{C}$-BALD outperforms other Bayesian active learning methods in censored regression.",

    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯主动学习基于信息论方法，专注于最大化新观测提供给模型参数的信息。通常通过最大化贝叶斯主动学习通过分歧（BALD）获得函数来实现。然而，我们强调，在新数据点遭受审查时估计BALD是具有挑战性的，其中只观察到目标的剪辑值。为了解决这个问题，我们推导了被审查分布的熵和互信息，并推导了被审查回归中的主动学习的BALD目标（$\\mathcal{C}$-BALD）。我们提出了一种新颖的建模方法来估计$\\mathcal{C}$-BALD目标，并将其用于被审查设置中的主动学习。通过一系列广泛的数据集和模型，我们证明$\\mathcal{C}$-BALD在被审查回归中优于其他贝叶斯主动学习方法。",
