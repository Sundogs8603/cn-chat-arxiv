    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的在线聚类算法，其中将进化限制玻尔兹曼机（ERBM）与Kohonen网络（ERBM-KNet）相结合。所提出的ERBM-KNet利用ERBM以单次传递模式高效处理流式数据，利用偏差-方差策略进行神经元的生长和修剪，以及基于聚类更新策略进行在线聚类和使用KNet进行聚类中心更新。初始阶段，ERBM在处理未标记的图像数据时演化其体系结构，有效地解开了潜在空间中的数据分布。随后，KNet利用从ERBM提取的特征来预测聚类数量并更新聚类中心。通过克服聚类算法常见的挑战，如聚类数量的先验初始化和聚类准确度低下，所提出的ERBM-KNet能够显著提升性能。",
