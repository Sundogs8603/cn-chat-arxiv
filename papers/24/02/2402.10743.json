Most of the information of the Yishui school of traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is stored in the form of unstructured classical Chinese text. The key information extraction of TCM texts plays an important role in mining and studying the academic schools of TCM. In order to solve these problems efficiently using artificial intelligence methods, this study constructs a word segmentation and entity relationship extraction model based on conditional random fields under the framework of natural language processing technology to identify and extract the entity relationship of traditional Chinese medicine texts, and uses the common weighting technology of TF-IDF information retrieval and data mining to extract important key entity information in different",
