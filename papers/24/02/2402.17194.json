Predicting the three trends of stock pricesrising, sideways, and falling can assist investors in making informed decisions about buying, holding, or selling stocks.

    "translated_abstract": "股市是金融市场的重要组成部分，在投资者财富积累、上市公司融资成本和国民宏观经济稳定发展方面发挥着关键作用。股市的显著波动可能损害股票投资者的利益，并导致产业结构失衡，从而干扰国民经济的宏观发展。预测股价走势是学术界的热门研究课题。预测股价上涨、横盘和下跌这三种趋势可以帮助投资者做出买入、持有或卖出股票的明智决策。建立有效的预测模型以预测这些趋势具有极其重要的实际意义。本文评估了结合人工智能的随机森林模型在四只股票测试集上的预测性能。",
