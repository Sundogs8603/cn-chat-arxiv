However, this is a very relevant topic, especially if users have had no direct contact with Europe and its perception depends solely on information retrieved online. In this work we analyse the information circulating online about Europe and migration after retrieving a large amount of data from social media (Twitter), to gain new insights into topics, magnitude, and dynamics of their diffusion. We combine retweets and hashtags network analysis with geolocation of users, linking thus data to geography and allowing analysis from an \"outside Europe\" perspective, with a special focus on Africa. We also introduce a novel approach based on cross-lingual quotes, i.e. when content in a language is commented and retweeted in another language, assuming these interactions are a proxy for connections between very distant ",

    "translated_abstract": "与欧洲和移民相关的信息在线传播很少受到外部视角的调查。然而，这是一个非常相关的主题，特别是如果用户没有直接接触过欧洲，其对欧洲的看法完全取决于在线检索到的信息。在这项工作中，我们分析了从社交媒体（Twitter）中检索的大量数据后，关于欧洲和移民在线流通的信息，以获得关于话题、规模和传播动态的新见解。我们将转发和标签网络分析与用户地理位置信息相结合，将数据与地理位置联系起来，允许从“欧洲外部”视角进行分析，特别关注非洲。我们还引入了一种基于跨语引语的创新方法，即当一种语言的内容被另一种语言评论和转发时，假设这些互动是远距离连接的代理。",
