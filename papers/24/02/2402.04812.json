Open-ended survey responses serve as a valuable source of information. This paper proposes a machine learning approach for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) of Dutch open-ended responses in employee satisfaction surveys. Our approach aims to overcome the inherent noise and variability in these responses, enabling a comprehensive analysis of sentiments that can support employee lifecycle management. Through response clustering we identify six key aspects (salary, schedule, contact, communication, personal attention, agreements), which we validate by domain experts. We compile a dataset of 1,458 Dutch survey responses, revealing label imbalance in aspects and sentiments. We propose few-shot approaches for ABSA based on Dutch BERT models, and compare them against bag-of-words and zero-shot baselines. Our work significantly contributes to the field of ABSA by d",

    "translated_abstract": "理解员工喜好、意见和情感对于有效的员工生命周期管理至关重要。开放式调查回应作为有价值的信息来源。本文提出了一种机器学习方法，用于分析员工满意度调查中荷兰开放式回应的基于方面的情感分析(ABSA)。我们的方法旨在克服这些回应中固有的噪声和变异性，实现对情感的全面分析，以支持员工生命周期管理。通过回应聚类，我们确定了六个关键方面(薪水、时间安排、联系、沟通、个人关注、协议)，并由领域专家进行了验证。我们编制了一个由1,458个荷兰调查回应组成的数据集，揭示了方面和情感的标签不平衡。我们提出了基于荷兰BERT模型的几个小批量学习方法，与词袋模型和零样本模型进行了对比。我们的工作在ABSA领域做出了重大贡献。",
