    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现将对话生成推向了新的领域，特别是在角色扮演系统（RPSs）领域。尽管现有基于LLM的RPS已经通过普通角色相关培训对话进行了增强，但在处理边界情境中的复杂和受困查询时，仍然存在着与角色不对齐的问题。在本文中，我们设计了模块化协调的陷阱设置交互系统（MORTISE），来评估和提高角色扮演LLMs的性能。MORTISE可以通过多个基于LLM的模块的协作努力产生高度与角色相关的积极查询，并通过一致的响应生成器制定相应的回复，从而创建对抗性训练数据集。我们选择了190种中文和英文角色来构建积极的查询，以评估现有的角色扮演LLMs。通过全面评估，我们发现现有模型在角色表示上普遍存在不足。",
