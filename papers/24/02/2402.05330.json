    "translated_abstract": "在我们的训练数据和目标数据之间，标签和潜在干扰参数的分布不同的情况下，如何以可靠的不确定性度量对事件进行分类是一个科学挑战。我们将这种分布转移称为广义标签转移 (GLS)。直接使用观测数据 $\\mathbf{X}$ 进行分类会导致预测结果偏差和标签 $Y$ 的无效不确定性估计。我们通过将分类问题视为带有干扰参数的假设检验问题来克服这些偏差。关键思想是在整个干扰参数空间中估计分类器的接收者操作特性 (ROC)，这使我们能够设计在 GLS 下不变的截断点。我们的方法有效地赋予预训练的分类器领域适应能力，并返回有效的预测集合，同时保持有效的不确定性估计。",
