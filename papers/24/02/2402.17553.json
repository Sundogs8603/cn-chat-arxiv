    "translated_abstract": "几十年来，人机交互从根本上一直是手动的。即使在今天，几乎所有在计算机上进行的高效工作都需要人类在每一步都提供输入。虚拟主动智能代表了自动化许多这些琐碎任务的一个激动人心的步骤。虚拟代理将使技术能力有限的用户能够充分利用计算机系统的各种可能性。它们还可以实现高效地简化许多计算机任务，从日历管理到复杂的旅行预订，减少人类干预。在这篇论文中，我们介绍了 OmniACT，这是一个用于评估代理生成可执行程序来完成计算机任务能力的首个数据集和基准。我们的范围超越了传统的Web自动化，涵盖了各种桌面应用。该数据集包含诸如\"播放下一首歌\"之类的基本任务，以及更为长期的任务",
