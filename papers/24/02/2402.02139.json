    "translated_abstract": "由于污染源复杂且地面空气质量监测站数量不足，高分辨率的细颗粒物（PM2.5）浓度制图是德黑兰市面临的挑战。作为替代，可以使用高分辨率的卫星气溶胶光学深度（AOD）数据来制图。为了达到这个目的，文献中使用了不同的数据驱动方法。最近，深度学习方法展示了其从AOD数据估计PM2.5的能力。然而，这些方法在解决从卫星AOD数据估计PM2.5的问题上存在一些弱点。本文评估了深度集成森林方法在从AOD数据估计PM2.5浓度方面的潜力。结果表明，深度集成森林方法（R2 = 0.74）比深度学习方法（R2 = 0.67）以及经典的数据驱动方法如随机森林（R2 = 0.68）具有更高的PM2.5估计精度。",
