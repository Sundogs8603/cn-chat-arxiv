However, the utilization of Monte Carlo sampling in this process introduces a compute-intensive element, which constrains the practicality of randomized smoothing on a larger scale. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that replaces Monte Carlo sampling with the training of a surrogate neural network. Through extensive experimentation in various settings, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in approximating the smoothed classifier with remarkable precision.

    "translated_abstract": "随机平滑以其使用特定分布的平滑噪声确保平滑分类器的鲁棒性而成为一种有效的可证明的对抗性攻击防御方法。然而，这个过程中蒙特卡洛抽样的使用引入了一个计算密集型的因素，限制了在较大规模上实践随机平滑的可行性。为了解决这个局限，我们提出了一种新的方法，用训练替代了蒙特卡洛抽样。通过在各种设置下的广泛实验，我们展示了我们的方法在近似平滑分类器方面具有显著的精确性。此外，我们还证明了我们的方法显著加速了鲁棒半径认证过程，在计算时间上提供了近600倍的改进，克服了传统随机平滑中的计算瓶颈。",
