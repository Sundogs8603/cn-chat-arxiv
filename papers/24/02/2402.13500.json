The proposed methodology combines multi-level translation, semantic embedding-based expansion, and user profile-centered augmentation to address the challenge of matching variance between user queries and relevant documents. Through an initial BM25 retrieval, translation into intermediate languages, embedding lookup of similar terms, and iterative re-ranking, the technique aims to expand the scope of potentially relevant results personalized to the individual user.

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了一种新颖技术，通过基于用户的词汇-语义空间的迭代查询优化来提高跨语言信息检索(CLIR)系统中的召回率。提出的方法结合了多级翻译、基于语义嵌入的扩展，以及以用户配置文件为中心的扩展，以解决用户查询和相关文档之间的匹配差异挑战。通过初始的BM25检索、转换为中间语言、查找相似术语的嵌入，以及迭代重新排名，该技术旨在扩大可能与个体用户相关的潜在结果范围。对新闻和Twitter数据集的比较实验证明，所提方法在ROUGE指标方面优于基线BM25排名。翻译方法还通过多步骤过程展示出了保持的语义准确性。",
