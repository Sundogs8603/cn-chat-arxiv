    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）如gpt-3.5-turbo和claude-instant-1.2在解释和执行语义任务方面变得非常重要。不幸的是，这些模型固有的偏见，类似于人类的认知偏见，会对它们的性能产生不利影响。其中一个受到影响最大的是从列表中进行对象选择，这是数字导航和决策制定中的基本操作。本研究重点检查这些偏见，并量化其对代表性列表选择任务的影响。通过进行一系列控制实验，我们操纵了温度、列表长度、对象身份、对象类型、提示复杂度和模型，以探索这些偏见。这使得我们能够孤立和测量这些偏见对选择行为的影响。我们的研究结果表明，偏见结构在很大程度上取决于模型，而对象类型调节了偏见影响的程度。由于存在较强的初现效应，列表中的第一个对象会在输出中被过度呈现。",
