    "translated_abstract": "建立在Alfonseca等人（2021）的工作基础上，我们研究了证明任意人工智能机器将展示某种行为在逻辑上可能的条件。为此，我们发展了一种类似但数学上独立于形式语言及其属性理论的形式化方法。我们的形式化方法不仅提供了准确的方式来描述我们对机器期望的特征（如智能、可控、道德等），而且还详细说明了判断给定任意机器是否具有这样的特征在逻辑上可能的条件。与Alfonseca等人（2021）的结果相反，我们发现可计算性理论中的Rice定理通常不能用于判断给定的任意机器是否具有给定特征。因此，并不一定可以决定是否一个任意机器是智能的。",

Contrary to previous results, Rice's theorem is found to be insufficient for determining whether a machine possesses a given trait."
