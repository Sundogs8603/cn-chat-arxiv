This mismatch is often not an instance of covariate shift (as commonly formalized) because the validation and test locations are fixed (e.g., on a grid or at select points) rather than i.i.d. from two distributions. In the present work, we formalize a check on validation methods: that they become arbitrarily accurate as validation data becomes arbitrarily dense.

    "translated_abstract": "空间预测任务对于天气预报、空气污染研究和其他科学工作至关重要。确定我们对统计或物理方法所作预测的可信度是科学结论的重要问题。不幸的是，传统的验证方法无法处理验证位置和我们希望进行预测的（测试）位置之间的不匹配。这种不匹配通常不是协变量偏移的一个实例（常常被形式化），因为验证和测试位置是固定的（例如，在网格上或选定的点上），而不是从两个分布中独立同分布地采样。在本文中，我们形式化了对验证方法的检查：随着验证数据的密度越来越大，它们能够变得任意精确。我们证明了传统方法和协变量偏移方法可能不满足这个检查。相反，我们提出了一种方法，它借鉴了协变量偏移文献中的现有思想，但对验证数据进行了调整。",
