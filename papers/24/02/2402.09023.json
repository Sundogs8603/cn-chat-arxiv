Understanding attack tactics helps improve the robustness of RSs.

In order to achieve these goals, we introduce textual reviews of products to enhance the generation quality of the profiles. Specifically, we propose a novel attack framework named R-Trojan, which formulates the attack objectives as an optimization problem and adopts a tailored transformer-based generative adversarial network (GAN) to solve it so that high-quality attack profiles can be produced.

    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，推荐系统(RSs)对数据污染攻击非常容易受到攻击。理解攻击策略有助于提高RSs的稳健性。我们打算开发高效的攻击方法，利用有限资源生成高质量的虚假用户配置文件，实现以下目标：1）在黑盒RSs之间实现可转移性；2）在检测器中实现感知度。为了实现这些目标，我们引入产品的文本评论来提高配置文件的生成质量。具体而言，我们提出了一种名为R-Trojan的新型攻击框架，将攻击目标构建为一个优化问题，并采用定制的基于Transformer的生成对抗网络（GAN）来解决它，从而可以产生高质量的攻击配置文件。对实际数据集进行的全面实验表明，R-Trojan在黑盒设置下显著优于各种受攻击的RSs的最新攻击方法。",
