    "translated_abstract": "在安全关键领域，比如自动驾驶（AD）中，物体检测器的错误可能会危及行人和其他易受伤害的道路用户（VRU）。由于常见的评估指标不是一个合适的安全指标，最近的研究采用了一些方法来识别安全关键的VRU，并将风险反馈给物体检测器。然而，这些方法在深度神经网络（DNN）训练过程中并没有考虑安全因素。因此，最先进的DNN会对所有误检进行相同的惩罚，而不考虑它们的重要性。为了减少关键故障案例（即假阴性）的发生，可能需要一种安全意识的训练策略来提高对关键行人的检测性能。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的安全意识损失变分，在训练过程中利用了每个行人的关键性评分。我们利用了基于可达性集的碰撞时间（TTC-RSB）度量和距离...",
