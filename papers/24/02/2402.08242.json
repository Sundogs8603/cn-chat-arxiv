    "translated_abstract": "机器学习（ML）和人工智能（AI）的方法往往会复制和放大现有的偏见和成见，AI机器人也是如此。例如，具备面部识别功能的机器人未能将黑人女性识别为人类，而其他机器人则仅根据外表将人们，如黑人男性，归类为罪犯。在“AI供应链”中，一种“模块化文化”意味着伤害被认为是“超出范围”的，或者是别人的责任。事件的发生是 routine enough（incidentdatabase.ai 列举了2000多个例子）以表明很少有组织能够完全尊重人们的权利；实现所声称的公平性、多样性和包容性（EDI或DEI）目标；或者识别然后解决这些组织和工件中的失败。我们提出了一个框架，用于调整广泛实践的研发项目管理方法，以建立组织的公平能力并更好地整合",
