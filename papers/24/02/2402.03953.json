    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一个具有开创性的知识系统化(SoK)计划，重点深入探索交易者在中心化交易所(CEXs)和去中心化交易所(DEXs)中关于永续期货合约的动态和行为。我们改进了现有模型，以研究交易者对价格波动的反应，创建了一个针对这些合约平台的新的分析框架，同时突出了区块链技术在其应用中的作用。我们的研究包括对CEXs的历史数据的比较分析，以及对DEXs上的完整交易数据的更详尽的研究。在虚拟自动化市场做市商(VAMM)模型的DEX上，多头和空头持仓量对价格波动产生相反的影响，这归因于VAMM的价格形成机制。在采用预言机定价模型的DEX中，我们观察到买家和卖家之间交易者行为上存在明显的不对称性。",

The research reveals that in DEXs with the VAMM model, long and short positions have opposite effects on price volatility, while in DEXs with the Oracle Pricing Model, there is a clear asymmetry in trader behavior between buyers and sellers."
