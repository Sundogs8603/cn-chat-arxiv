    "translated_abstract": "薛定谔桥匹配(SB)近年来引起了机器学习界的关注，作为经典扩散模型的一个有希望的扩展，也与熵最优输运(EOT)相互关联。最近的SB求解器利用了普遍的桥匹配程序。这些程序旨在在只有两个分布之间的输运计划的情况下，恢复一种随机过程来输运质量。特别地，给定EOT计划，这些程序可以被适应用于解决SB。这个事实被最近的研究工作广泛利用，形成了基于匹配的SB求解器。关键就是恢复EOT计划：最近的工作要么使用启发式的近似方法(如小批量输运)或者建立迭代匹配程序，这样设计上在训练过程中累积了误差。我们解决了这些限制，并提出了一种新的学习SB的方法，我们称之为\\textbf{优化的薛定谔桥匹配}。它利用了薛定谔桥的最优参数化。",
