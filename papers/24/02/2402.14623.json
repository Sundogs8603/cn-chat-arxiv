    "translated_abstract": "在具身人工智能领域，高级任务规划和代码生成在开放世界机器人操作中取得了快速进展。然而，先前的研究主要集中在大规模语言或多模态模型的常识推理和任务规划能力上，对于生成代码在实际机器人和其他自主机器人系统基本组件（包括机器人感知、运动规划和控制）上的部署性付出的努力相对较少。为了弥合这种“理想到实际”的差距，本文提出了RoboScript，一个平台，用于1）由代码生成驱动的可部署机器人操作流水线；和2）自由形式自然语言中机器人操作任务的代码生成基准。RoboScript平台通过强调与仿真和真实机器人的统一接口解决了这一差距，基于对机器人操作系统（ROS）的抽象实现。",
