    "translated_abstract": "设计用于解决典型监督分类问题的算法只能从固定的样本和标签集中学习，这使它们不适用于实际世界中数据以样本流的形式到达，并且往往随时间关联着多个标签。这促使研究与任务无关的连续多标签学习问题。虽然最近的文献中提出了使用深度学习方法进行连续多标签学习的算法，但它们往往具有较大的计算量。虽然脉冲神经网络（SNNs）提供了一种计算效率高的人工神经网络替代方案，但现有文献尚未将其用于连续多标签学习。此外，准确地确定SNNs的多个标签仍然是一个开放的研究问题。本研究提出了一种双输出脉冲架构（DOSA）来弥合这些研究差距。还提出了一种新的不平衡感知的损失函数，从而提高了多标记分类性能。",
