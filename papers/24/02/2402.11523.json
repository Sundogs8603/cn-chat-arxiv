Researchers have begun leveraging contrastive learning to introduce additional self-supervised signals to address this. However, this approach often unintentionally distances the target user/item from their collaborative neighbors, limiting its efficacy. In response, we propose a solution that treats the collaborative neighbors of the anchor node as positive samples within the final objective loss function. This paper focuses on developing two unique supervised contrastive loss functions that effectively combine supervision signals with contrastive loss. We analyze our proposed loss functions through the gradient lens, demonstrating that different positive samples simultaneously influence updating the anchor node's embeddings. These samples' impact depends on their similarities to the anchor node and the negative sample",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管在推荐任务中有效，协同过滤（CF）技术面临着数据稀疏的挑战。研究人员已经开始利用对比学习引入额外的自监督信号来解决这一问题。然而，这种方法往往会无意中将目标用户/项目与他们的协作邻居分开，从而限制其有效性。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一个解决方案，将锚节点的协作邻居视为最终目标损失函数中的正样本。本文专注于开发两个独特的监督对比损失函数，有效结合了监督信号和对比损失。我们通过梯度视角分析了我们提出的损失函数，证明了不同的正样本同时影响更新锚节点的嵌入。这些样本的影响取决于它们与锚节点和负样本的相似性。",
