Sequential domains like Battlespace are important testbeds for planning problems, as such, the Department of Defense uses such domains for wargaming exercises. The agents we developed combine Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) techniques in an effort to navigate the game environment, avoid obstacles, interact with adversaries, and capture the flag.
