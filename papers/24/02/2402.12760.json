    "translated_abstract": "精心设计的提示已经证明能够指导文本到图像模型生成惊人的图像。虽然现有的提示工程方法可以提供高水平的指导，但是对于新手用户来说，通过手动输入提示来实现期望结果是具有挑战性的，这是因为新手用户输入的提示与模型优选提示之间存在差异。为了弥合用户输入行为和模型训练数据集之间的分布差距，我们首先构建了一个新颖的粗细粒度提示数据集(CFP)，并提出了一种新颖的用户友好的细粒度文本生成框架(UF-FGTG)用于自动提示优化。对于CFP，我们构建了一个新颖的文本到图像任务数据集，结合了粗糙和细粒度提示，以促进自动提示生成方法的发展。对于UF-FGTG，我们提出了一个新颖的框架，可以自动将用户输入的提示转换为模型优选提示。",
