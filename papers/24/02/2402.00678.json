    "translated_abstract": "智能城市应用的一个重要挑战是使系统适应与非专家用户的交互。机器人模仿框架旨在通过允许用户通过示范直接编程来简化和减少机器人编程的时间。在传统的框架中，动作被建模为关节或笛卡尔空间轨迹。然而，使用这些纯几何方法并不能很好地表示其他特征，比如视觉特征。连续目标导向动作(CGDA)是这些方法的一种替代方案，它将动作编码为可以从环境中提取的任何特征的变化。为了满足这种无关特征的编码，机器人执行的关节轨迹必须完全计算。为了实现这一点，通常需要使用进化算法(EA)进行计算，但这通常需要过多的评估才能在实际机器人中进行这个进化步骤。目前的策略是在模拟中进行评估，然后将评估结果转移到实际机器人上。",
