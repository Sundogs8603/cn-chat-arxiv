    "translated_abstract": "建筑能效是一个广泛研究的课题，由于对环境问题和能源独立性的关注，它正在迅速受到关注。在北欧，仅供热能就占到总建筑能耗的70％。工业4.0技术，如物联网、大数据、云计算和机器学习，以及预测性和主动性数字孪生的创建，可以帮助减少这个数字。然而，建筑的热动力学是一个非常复杂的过程，依赖于许多变量。因此，常用的基于物理的白盒模型需要耗费大量时间，并需要广泛的专业知识。相反，主要依赖建筑能耗数据的黑盒预测模型缺乏基本的洞察力，并且阻碍了再利用。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种架构，以在集成实时物联网数据与建筑物的3D表示的同时促进建筑热动力学的灰盒建模。",
