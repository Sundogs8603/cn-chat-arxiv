    "translated_abstract": "实体对齐（EA）旨在识别代表相同现实世界对象的不同知识图中的实体。最近基于嵌入的EA方法在EA方面取得了最先进的性能，但面临着解释性挑战，因为它们完全依赖于嵌入距离，并忽视了一对对齐实体背后的逻辑规则。在本文中，我们提出了Align-Subgraph实体对齐（ASGEA）框架来利用Align-Subgraphs中的逻辑规则。ASGEA使用锚链接作为桥梁来构建Align-Subgraphs，并沿着跨知识图的路径传播，这使其区别于基于嵌入的方法。此外，我们设计了一种可解释的基于路径的图神经网络ASGNN，以有效识别和整合跨知识图的逻辑规则。我们还引入了一个节点级多模态注意机制，结合多模态增强的锚点来增强Align-Subgraph。我们的实验结果",
