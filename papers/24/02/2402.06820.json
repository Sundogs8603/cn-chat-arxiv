    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种预测足球比赛中下一个事件的方法，这是一个与大型语言模型（LLMs）面临的问题非常相似的挑战。与其他严重限制足球事件动态的方法不同，这些方法往往从很多变量中抽象出来或依赖于混合顺序模型，我们的研究提出了一种受到LLMs方法学启发的新技术。这些模型预测了组成一个事件的完整变量链，大大简化了构建足球大事件模型（LEMs）的过程。利用公开可用的WyScout数据集进行深度学习，所提出的方法在关键领域（如下一个事件类型的预测准确性）显著超越了以往LEM提案的性能。本文突显了LEM在多种应用中的实用性，包括博彩和比赛分析。此外，我们还展示了LEM提供了一个模拟骨架，可以构建许多分析流水线。",
