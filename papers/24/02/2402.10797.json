It is designed for ease of use, speed, and modularity by taking a functional approach to the algorithms' implementation. BlackJAX is written in Python, using JAX to compile and run NumpPy-like samplers and variational methods on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. The library integrates well with probabilistic programming languages by working directly with the (un-normalized) target log density function. BlackJAX is intended as a collection of low-level, composable implementations of basic statistical 'atoms' that can be combined to perform well-defined Bayesian inference, but also provides high-level routines for ease of use. It is designed for users who need cutting-edge methods, researchers who want to create complex sampling methods, and people who want to learn how these work.",

    "translated_abstract": "BlackJAX是一个库，实现了在贝叶斯计算中常用的抽样和变分推断算法。它通过采用函数式方法实现算法，旨在提高易用性、速度和模块化。BlackJAX使用Python编写，利用JAX在CPU、GPU和TPU上编译和运行类似Numpy的抽样器和变分方法。该库通过直接处理（非正则化）目标对数密度函数，与概率编程语言很好地集成。BlackJAX旨在成为基本统计“基元”的低级可组合实现的集合，可组合执行定义良好的贝叶斯推断，同时还提供高级例程以提高易用性。它面向需要尖端方法的用户、希望创建复杂抽样方法的研究人员，以及想要了解这些方法工作原理的人。",
