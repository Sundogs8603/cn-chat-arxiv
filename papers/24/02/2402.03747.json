    "translated_abstract": "从数据集中发现偏微分方程（PDE）已经引起了越来越多的关注。然而，从稀疏数据和高噪声中发现控制方程仍然非常具有挑战性，这是由于导数计算的困难和噪声的干扰。此外，为了满足物理定律，候选库的选择原则还需要进一步研究。不变性是控制方程的基本定律之一。在本研究中，我们提出了一种约束不变性的深度学习网络（ICNet）用于PDE的发现。考虑到时空平移不变性（Galilean不变性）是物理定律的基本属性，我们过滤掉不能满足Galilean变换要求的候选项。然后，我们将固定和可能的项嵌入到神经网络的损失函数中，显著抵消了稀疏高噪声数据的影响。然后，通过过滤掉冗余项。",
