    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.16440v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Patents and scientific papers provide an essential source for measuring science and technology output, to be used as a basis for the most varied scientometric analyzes. Authors' and inventors' names are the key identifiers to carry out these analyses, which however, run up against the issue of disambiguation. By extension identifying inventors who are also academic authors is a non-trivial challenge. We propose a method using the International Patent Classification (IPC) and the IPCCAT API to assess the degree of similarity of patents and papers abstracts of a given inventor, in order to match both types of documents. The method is developed and manually qualified based on three corpora of patents extracted from the international EPO database Espacenet. Among a set of 4679 patents and 7720 inventors, we obtain 2501 authors. The proposed algorithm solves the general problem of disambiguation with an error rate lower than 5%.",

    "translated_abstract": "专利和科学论文是衡量科学技术产出的重要来源，可作为各种科学计量分析的基础。作者和发明者的姓名是进行这些分析的关键标识符，然而，他们遭遇了消歧的问题。本文提出了一种方法，使用国际专利分类（IPC）和IPCCAT API来评估给定发明者的专利和论文摘要之间的相似程度，以匹配两种类型的文档。该方法基于从国际EPO数据库Espacenet提取的三个专利语料库开发和手动评估。在4679篇专利和7720位发明者中，我们获得了2501位作者。提出的算法解决了消歧的一般问题，错误率低于5%。",
