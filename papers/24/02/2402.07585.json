    "translated_abstract": "对于大型机器学习模型的使用日益增长，关注点逐渐转向它们不断增加的计算需求。虽然人们已经开始关注训练阶段的能源消耗，但较少有研究考虑推断阶段。对于机器学习推断而言，将机器学习模型与用户访问的机器学习系统进行绑定，即机器学习服务，是实现机器学习应用效率的关键但鲜为人知的步骤。本文在机器学习架构设计决策和绿色人工智能方面进行文献研究，特别关注机器学习服务。目的是从学者和实践者的角度，分析机器学习服务架构设计决策，以了解并确定其与质量特性的关联，结合机器学习服务文献的背景。我们的研究结果(i)确定了机器学习服务架构设计决策以及它们对应的组件和相关技术栈，(ii)提供了机器学习服务领域质量特性的概述。",
