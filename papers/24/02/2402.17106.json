    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习公平性中，训练能够最小化不同敏感群体之间差异的模型通常会导致准确性下降，这种现象被称为公平性-准确性权衡。这种权衡的严重程度基本取决于数据集的特性，如数据集的不均衡或偏见。因此，在数据集之间使用统一的公平性要求仍然值得怀疑，并且往往会导致效用极低的模型。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种针对单个数据集量身定制的近似公平性-准确性权衡曲线的计算效率高的方法，该方法支持严格的统计保证。通过利用You-Only-Train-Once（YOTO）框架，我们的方法减轻了在逼近权衡曲线时需要训练多个模型的计算负担。此外，我们通过在该曲线周围引入置信区间来量化我们近似值的不确定性，",
