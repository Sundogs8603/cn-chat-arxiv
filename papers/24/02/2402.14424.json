    "translated_abstract": "我们的研究利用因果知识图谱和大型语言模型（LLM）之间的协同作用，引入了一种突破性的计算方法来生成心理学假设。我们使用LLM分析了43,312篇心理学文章，提取了因果关系对，生成了一个专门针对心理学的因果图。应用链接预测算法，我们生成了130个关注“幸福”的潜在心理学假设，然后将其与博士学者构思的研究想法和仅由LLM产生的想法进行了比较。有趣的是，我们的LLM和因果图的联合方法在新颖性方面与专家水平的洞察力保持一致，明显优于仅LLM的假设（分别为t(59)=3.34，p=0.007和t(59)=4.32，p<0.001）。这种一致性进一步通过深度语义分析得到证实。我们的结果表明，将LLM与因果图等机器学习技术相结合，可以更好地生成心理学假设。",
