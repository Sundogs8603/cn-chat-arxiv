However, many existing climate datasets, such as the gridded outputs of the state-of-the-art numerical climate models (e.g., general circulation models), are only available at very coarse spatial resolutions due to the model complexity and extremely high computational demand. Deep-learning-based methods, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their variants, have proved effective for refining natural images, and have shown great promise in improving scientific datasets. In this paper, we describe a conditional GAN-based geospatial downscaling method for extreme downscaling of gridded climate datasets.
