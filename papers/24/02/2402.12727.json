    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型是学习和从分布$p(x)$中抽样的一种非常有效的方法。在后验抽样中，人们还会给出一个测量模型$p(y \\mid x)$和一个测量$y$，希望从$p(x \\mid y)$中抽样。后验抽样对于诸如修补、超分辨率和MRI重建等任务非常有用，因此一些最近的工作已经给出了启发式近似算法；但没有一个已知能在多项式时间内收敛到正确的分布。",
    "tldr": "我们证明了后验抽样在计算上是难以解决的：在加密学中最基本的假设下——单向函数存在的假设下，存在一些实例，对于这些实例，每个算法都需要超多项式时间，即使无条件抽样可以证明是快速的。",
