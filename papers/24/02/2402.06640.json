    "translated_abstract": "大流行涉及到一种对全球和地方健康和经济模式产生影响的高传播疾病。通过对社区实施某些限制可以最小化大流行的影响。然而，尽管限制可以减少感染和死亡率，但也可能导致经济危机。流行病学模型通过提出基于非药物干预措施（如社交距离、宵禁和封锁）的大流行控制策略，减少这些限制的经济影响。然而，在考虑疾病传播和经济状况的情况下设计手动控制策略是非常困难的。最优策略可以通过多目标强化学习（MORL）模型设计，该模型展示了如何利用限制来优化大流行的结果。在这项研究中，我们利用了一种流行病学易感、暴露、感染、恢复、死亡（SEIRD）模型：一种用于虚拟模拟日常大流行的分区模型。",
