    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了Premier-TACO，这是一种多任务特征表示学习方法，旨在提高顺序决策任务中少样本策略学习的效率。Premier-TACO利用一部分多任务离线数据集进行预训练通用特征表示，该特征表示捕捉了关键的环境动力学，并使用最少的专家演示进行微调。它通过引入一种新的负例抽样策略推动了时序行动对比学习（TACO）目标的发展，TACO在视觉控制任务中具有最先进的结果。这种策略在显著提高TACO的计算效率方面非常重要，使大规模多任务离线预训练成为可能。我们在包括Deepmind Control Suite、MetaWorld和LIBERO在内的各种连续控制基准测试中进行了广泛的实证评估，证明了Premier-TACO在预训练视觉表示方面的有效性，显著增强了对新颖动作的少样本模仿学习。",
