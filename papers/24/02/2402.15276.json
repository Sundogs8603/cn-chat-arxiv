    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.15276v1 公告类型：跨领域 摘要：文本到图像检索在各种应用中起着至关重要的作用，包括数字图书馆、电子商务平台和多媒体数据库，通过使用文本查询来搜索图像。尽管多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）取得了先进的性能，但它们在大规模、多样化和模糊的检索场景中的适用性受到显着的计算需求和生成可注入的嵌入所限制。本文介绍了Text2Pic Swift框架，专为在庞大的数据集中有效和稳健地检索与广泛文本描述对应的图像而设计。该框架采用了两阶段方法：初始基于实体的排序（ER）阶段通过多查询对多目标的策略来解决长文本查询中固有的歧义，从而有效地缩小了可能的候选项，以便进行后续分析。接下来",
