    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11285v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: O-RAN systems and their deployment in virtualized general-purpose computing platforms (O-Cloud) constitute a paradigm shift expected to bring unprecedented performance gains. However, these architectures raise new implementation challenges and threaten to worsen the already-high energy consumption of mobile networks. This paper presents first a series of experiments which assess the O-Cloud's energy costs and their dependency on the servers' hardware, capacity and data traffic properties which, typically, change over time. Next, it proposes a compute policy for assigning the base station data loads to O-Cloud servers in an energy-efficient fashion; and a radio policy that determines at near-real-time the minimum transmission block size for each user so as to avoid unnecessary energy costs. The policies balance energy savings with performance, and ensure that both of them are dispersed fairly across the servers and users, respectively. ",

    "translated_abstract": "O-RAN系统及其在虚拟化通用计算平台（O-Cloud）中的部署构成了一个预计将带来前所未有的性能增益的范式转变。然而，这些架构带来了新的实施挑战，并威胁着加剧移动网络已经高能耗的问题。本文首先提出了一系列实验，评估了O-Cloud的能耗及其对服务器硬件、容量和数据流量特性的依赖性，这些特性通常会随时间改变。接下来，它提出了一个计算策略，以能效的方式将基站数据负载分配到O-Cloud服务器；以及一个无线策略，可实时确定每个用户的最小传输块大小，从而避免不必要的能源成本。这些策略平衡了能源节约和性能，并确保它们在服务器和用户之间分散公平。",
