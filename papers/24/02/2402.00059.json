    "translated_abstract": "公里级别的全球大气动力学建模可以实现精细化的天气预报，降低灾害性天气和气候活动的风险。因此，建立公里级全球预报模型是气象领域一直以来的追求。过去几十年，国际社会积极努力改善数值天气模型的空间分辨率。然而，由于计算资源的消耗巨大，发展更高分辨率的数值模型仍然是一个长期存在的挑战。最近，数据驱动的全球天气预报模型利用再分析数据进行模型训练，并展示出与数值模型相当甚至更高的预报技巧。然而，它们都受限于再分析数据的分辨率，无法生成更高分辨率的预报。本文介绍了FengWu-GHR，这是首个以数据驱动方式运行、0.09$^{\\circ}$水平分辨率的全球天气预报模型。",
