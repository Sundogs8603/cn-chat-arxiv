    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.15140v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hyper-relational knowledge graphs (KGs) contain additional key-value pairs, providing more information about the relations. In many scenarios, the same relation can have distinct key-value pairs, making the original triple fact more recognizable and specific. Prior studies on hyper-relational KGs have established a solid standard method for hyper-relational graph encoding. In this work, we propose a message-passing-based graph encoder with global relation structure awareness ability, which we call ReSaE. Compared to the prior state-of-the-art approach, ReSaE emphasizes the interaction of relations during message passing process and optimizes the readout structure for link prediction tasks. Overall, ReSaE gives a encoding solution for hyper-relational KGs and ensures stronger performance on downstream link prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that ReSaE achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple link prediction benchmarks.",

    "translated_abstract": "超关系知识图包含额外的键值对，提供关于关系的更多信息。在许多情况下，相同的关系可以具有不同的键值对，使原始三元组事实更具识别性和特定性。先前关于超关系知识图的研究已经建立了一种稳固的超关系图编码方法。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种具有全局关系结构意识能力的基于消息传递的图编码器，我们称之为ReSaE。与先前的最先进方法相比，ReSaE强调了在消息传递过程中关系的交互，并优化了用于链接预测任务的读取结构。总体而言，ReSaE为超关系知识图提供了一种编码解决方案，并确保在下游链接预测任务上具有更强的性能。我们的实验表明，ReSaE在多个链接预测基准上实现了最先进的性能。",
