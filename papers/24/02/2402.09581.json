First, we provide background information about deepfakes and review the harms they pose. We describe how deepfakes are currently used to proliferate sexual abuse material, commit fraud, manipulate voter behavior, and pose threats to national security. Second, we review previous legislative proposals designed to address deepfakes. Third, we present a comprehensive policy proposal that focuses on addressing multiple parts of the deepfake supply chain. The deepfake supply chain begins with a small number of model developers, model providers, and compute providers, and it expands to include billions of potential deepfake creators. We describe this supply chain in greater detail and describe how entities at each step of the supply chain ought to take reasonable measures to prevent the creation and proliferation of deepfakes. Finally, we address potential counterpo",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文提供了应对深度伪造威胁的政策建议。首先，我们提供了有关深度伪造的背景信息，并回顾了它们所带来的危害。我们描述了目前深度伪造被用于传播性虐待材料、进行欺诈、操纵选民行为以及对国家安全构成威胁的情况。其次，我们回顾了先前的立法提案，旨在解决深度伪造问题。第三，我们提出了一项全面的政策建议，重点解决深度伪造供应链的多个环节。深度伪造供应链从少数模型开发者、模型提供者和计算提供者开始，扩展至数十亿潜在的深度伪造制作者。我们详细描述了这个供应链，并说明每个环节的实体都应采取合理措施，防止深度伪造的制造和传播。最后，我们讨论了可能的对策措施。",
