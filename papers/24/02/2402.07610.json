    "translated_abstract": "自对齐是一种降低人工注释成本并确保模型能力的有效方法。然而，大多数当前的方法在单次循环中完成数据收集和训练步骤，可能忽视了自对齐模型不断改进的能力。这引发了一个关键问题：如果我们进行多次自助引导自对齐，会增强模型性能还是导致快速退化？本文首次探索了自助引导自对齐对大型语言模型的影响。我们的研究结果表明，通过保证从上下文学习中获得的数据多样性，自助引导自对齐明显优于单次循环的方法。为了进一步发挥自助引导的能力，我们还研究并调整了数据的训练顺序，从而提高了模型的性能。基于这些发现，我们提出了踩脚调校（SOFT）的方法，利用模型的持续增强能力。",
