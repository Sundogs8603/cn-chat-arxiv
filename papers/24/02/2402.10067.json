    "translated_abstract": "自动化管理需要将高级用户请求，例如意图，分解成系统可以理解和执行的抽象。这是具有挑战性的，因为即使是一个简单的意图也需要执行一系列有序的步骤。而识别和适应这些步骤（随着条件的变化）的任务需要一种无法事先完全定义的分解方法。为了解决这些挑战并支持自动化的意图分解和执行，我们探索了大型语言模型（LLM）的少样本能力。我们提出了一个管道，通过生成所需的动作，使用基于策略的抽象逐步分解意图。这使我们能够通过创建用于意图部署的闭控制循环来自动化策略执行。为此，我们生成并将策略映射到API，并形成执行所需的监控、分析、计划和执行的应用管理循环。",
