    "abstract": "Neurons in the brain communicate information via punctual events called spikes. The timing of spikes is thought to carry rich information, but it is not clear how to leverage this in digital systems. We demonstrate that event-based encoding is efficient for audio compression. To build this event-based representation we use a deep binary auto-encoder, and under high sparsity pressure, the model enters a regime where the binary event matrix is stored more efficiently with sparse matrix storage algorithms. We test this on the large MAESTRO dataset of piano recordings against vector quantized auto-encoders. Not only does our \"Spiking Music compression\" algorithm achieve a competitive compression/reconstruction trade-off, but selectivity and synchrony between encoded events and piano key strikes emerge without supervision in the sparse regime.",

    "translated_abstract": "大脑中的神经元通过称为脉冲的点时间事件传递信息。脉冲的时序被认为包含丰富的信息，但如何利用这些信息在数字系统中还不清楚。我们证明了基于事件的编码对音频压缩是有效的。为了构建这种基于事件的表示，我们使用了深度二进制自编码器，并在高稀疏约束下，模型进入一种稀疏矩阵存储算法更高效存储二进制事件矩阵的状态。我们在大型MAESTRO钢琴录音数据集上将其与矢量量化自编码器进行了测试。我们的“Spiking Music压缩”算法不仅在压缩/重构的权衡上取得了有竞争力的结果，而且在稀疏状态下，在编码的事件和钢琴按键击打之间出现了自主产生的选择性和同步。",
