In these problems, an online player makes decisions $\\mathbf{x}_t$ in a metric space $(X,d)$ to simultaneously minimize their hitting cost $f_t(\\mathbf{x}_t)$ and switching cost as determined by the metric. Over the time horizon $T$, the player must satisfy a long-term demand constraint $\\sum_{t} c(\\mathbf{x}_t) \\geq 1$, where $c(\\mathbf{x}_t)$ denotes the fraction of demand satisfied at time $t$. Such problems can find a wide array of applications to online resource allocation in sustainable energy and computing systems. We devise optimal competitive and learning-augmented algorithms for specific instantiations of these problems, and further show that our proposed algorithms perform well in numerical experiments.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入并研究了一类带有长期约束的在线度量问题。在这些问题中，一个在线玩家在度量空间$(X,d)$中做出决策$\\mathbf{x}_t$，同时最小化他们的命中成本$f_t(\\mathbf{x}_t)$和由度量确定的切换成本。在时间跨度$T$内，玩家必须满足长期需求约束$\\sum_{t} c(\\mathbf{x}_t) \\geq 1$，其中$c(\\mathbf{x}_t)$表示时间$t$时满足的需求比例。这类问题在可持续能源和计算系统中的在线资源分配中有着广泛的应用。我们为这些问题的具体实例设计了最优的竞争算法和学习增强算法，并进一步展示了我们提出的算法在数值实验中表现良好。",
