Each user benefits from platform services in exchange for data, incurring privacy loss when their data, albeit noisily, is shared with the buyer. The user chooses platforms to share data with, while platforms decide on data noise levels and pricing before selling to the buyer. The buyer selects platforms to purchase data from. We model these interactions via a multi-stage game, focusing on the subgame Nash equilibrium. We find that when the buyer places a high value on user data (and platforms can command high prices), all platforms offer services to the user who joins and shares data with every platform. Conversely, when the buyer's valuation of user data is low, only large platforms with low service costs can afford to serve users. In this scenario, users exclusively join and share data with these low-cost platforms. Interestingly, increased",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一个由用户（数据所有者）、平台和数据购买方组成的三层数据市场。每个用户通过共享数据获得平台服务，当他们的数据与购买方共享时，会发生隐私损失，尽管以噪声形式共享。用户选择与哪些平台分享数据，而平台在出售给购买方之前决定数据的噪声水平和定价。购买方选择从哪些平台购买数据。我们通过多阶段博弈模型来描述这些互动，重点研究子博弈纳什均衡。我们发现，当购买方对用户数据的价值较高（平台能够获取高价格）时，所有平台都向用户提供服务，并且用户加入并与每个平台分享数据。相反，当购买方对用户数据的估值较低时，只有低成本的大型平台能够为用户提供服务。在这种情况下，用户只加入并与这些低成本平台分享数据。有趣的是，增加平台数量会增加用户参与的意愿，但也会提高平台之间的竞争。",
