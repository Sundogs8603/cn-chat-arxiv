    "translated_abstract": "虽然移动设备收集的位置数据非常有用（例如，用于COVID-19预测和政策制定、城市流动性分析和营销、以及获取商业洞见），但这些数据通常来自于一个带有偏向性的人口子集，某些社区在收集的数据中被过度或者低估了。因此，从这样的数据集计算的汇总统计数据（如Safegraph、Google和Facebook等各种公司所做的那样），如果忽视了偏见，会导致对人口统计数据的不准确表示。这样的统计数据不仅普遍不准确，而且错误将不成比例地影响不同的人口亚组（例如，因为它们忽视了被低估的社区）。这会带来严重后果，因为这些数据集被用于像COVID-19政策制定这样的敏感决策。本文解决了利用这种有偏差数据提供准确人口统计数据的问题。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种应对使用偏倚位置数据计算人口统计数据造成的不准确性的方法，以解决这些数据集在敏感决策中可能产生的严重后果。",
