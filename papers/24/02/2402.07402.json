    "abstract": "As a foundational component of cognitive intelligence, theory of mind (ToM) can make AI more closely resemble human thought processes, thereby enhancing their interaction and collaboration with human. In particular, it can significantly improve a model's comprehension of videos in complex scenes. However, current video question answer (VideoQA) datasets focus on studying causal reasoning within events few of them genuinely incorporating human ToM. Consequently, there is a lack of development in ToM reasoning tasks within the area of VideoQA. This paper presents BDIQA, the first benchmark to explore the cognitive reasoning capabilities of VideoQA models in the context of ToM. BDIQA is inspired by the cognitive development of children's ToM and addresses the current deficiencies in machine ToM within datasets and tasks. Specifically, it offers tasks at two difficulty levels, assessing Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) reasoning in both simple and complex scenarios. We conduct evaluation",

    "translated_abstract": "作为认知智能的基础组成部分，心智理论（ToM）可以使人工智能更加接近人类思维过程，从而增强其与人类的互动和协作能力。特别是在复杂场景中，它可以显著提高模型对视频的理解能力。然而，当前的视频问答（VideoQA）数据集主要集中在研究事件中的因果推理，很少涉及真正融入人类ToM的内容。因此，在VideoQA领域中缺乏对ToM推理任务的发展。本文介绍了BDIQA，这是第一个基准，用于探索VideoQA模型在ToM背景下的认知推理能力。BDIQA受到儿童ToM认知发展的启发，并解决了现有数据集和任务中机器ToM的不足。具体而言，它提供了两个难度级别的任务，评估了简单和复杂场景中的信念、欲望和意图（BDI）推理。我们进行了评估。",
