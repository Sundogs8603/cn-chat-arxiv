EVs often experience vibrations when driving on rough terrains, known as torsional resonance. This resonance, caused by the interaction between motor and tire vibrations, puts excessive loads on the vehicle's drive shaft. However, current damping technologies only detect resonance after the vibration amplitude of the drive shaft torque reaches a certain threshold, leading to significant loads on the shaft at the time of detection. In this study, we propose a novel approach to address this issue by introducing Resoformer, a transformer-based model for predicting torsional resonance. Resoformer utilizes time-series of the motor rotation speed as input and predicts the amplitude of torsional vibration at a specified quantile occurring in the shaft after the input series.

    "translated_abstract": "准确预测时间序列振动是电动汽车（EVs）的重要研究问题。EVs在崎岖地形上行驶时经常会产生振动，被称为扭振共振。这种由电机和轮胎振动之间的相互作用引起的共振会在车辆传动轴上施加过大负荷。然而，当前的阻尼技术仅在传动轴扭矩振动幅度达到一定阈值后才能检测到共振，导致在检测时传动轴上承受重要负荷。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法来解决这一问题，引入了Resoformer，一种用于预测扭振的基于transformer的模型。Resoformer利用电机转速的时间序列作为输入，并在输入序列之后的特定分位数处预测传动轴扭振的幅度。通过计算递归和卷积之间的注意力",
