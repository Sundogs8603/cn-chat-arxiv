    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.13279v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this study, we will address some topics related to the privatization of airports in the scientific literature, in an attempt to provide an answer to the following question: does the privatization of airports bring positive results? Firstly, we turn our attention to the motivations leading to privatization, considering the two main parties involved, the government and the private sector. After all, the success of such a decision will be relative to the reasons that justify it. In a second moment, we will consider the regulatory issue, whose influence on the airport's financial performance is consolidated in the literature. In the third part, we address the main documented results of privatization, with special attention to productive efficiency, whose improvement is the most popular motivation for privatization.",
