    "title": "Mobile Fitting Room: On-device Virtual Try-on via Diffusion Models",
    "abstract": "The growing digital landscape of fashion e-commerce calls for interactive and user-friendly interfaces for virtually trying on clothes. Traditional try-on methods grapple with challenges in adapting to diverse backgrounds, poses, and subjects. While newer methods, utilizing the recent advances of diffusion models, have achieved higher-quality image generation, the human-centered dimensions of mobile interface delivery and privacy concerns remain largely unexplored. We present Mobile Fitting Room, the first on-device diffusion-based virtual try-on system. To address multiple inter-related technical challenges such as high-quality garment placement and model compression for mobile devices, we present a novel technical pipeline and an interface design that enables privacy preservation and user customization. A usage scenario highlights how our tool can provide a seamless, interactive virtual try-on experience for customers and provide a valuable service for fashion e-commerce businesses.",

    "translated_abstract": "在日益增长的时尚电子商务领域，需要交互式和用户友好的界面来进行虚拟试穿衣服。传统的试穿方法在适应不同的背景、姿势和主体方面存在困难。虽然利用最近扩散模型的进展而产生了更高质量的图像生成，但移动界面交付的以人为中心的维度和隐私问题大部分仍未被探索。我们提出了移动试衣间，这是第一个基于设备内扩散的虚拟试穿系统。为了解决多个相互关联的技术挑战，如高质量服装放置和移动设备的模型压缩，我们提出了一种新颖的技术流程和界面设计，实现隐私保护和用户定制。一个使用场景突显了我们的工具如何为顾客提供无缝、互动的虚拟试穿体验，并为时尚电子商务企业提供有价值的服务。",
