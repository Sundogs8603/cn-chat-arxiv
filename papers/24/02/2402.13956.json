    "translated_abstract": "Merrill等人（2022）认为，在理论上，最优LM预测的概率编码了关于蕴涵关系的语义信息，但是由于Merrill等人提出的强烈理想化假设，不清楚神经LM在训练语料库上是否通过这种方式学习蕴涵。在这项工作中，我们调查了他们的理论是否可以用于从神经LM中解码蕴涵判断。我们发现类似于他们的测试可以在许多数据集和LM中解码自然句子之间的蕴涵关系，远远超过随机机会，尽管不是完美的。这表明LM隐含地模拟了语义的某些方面，以预测句子共现模式上的语义效应。但是，我们发现实际上预测蕴涵的测试与理论测试的方向相反。因此，我们重新审视了潜在的理论假设。",
