In this paper, we study a market-driven approach to rescue a bank in distress based on the idea of claims trading, a notion defined in Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We formalize the idea in the context of financial networks by Eisenberg and Noe. For two given banks v and w, we consider the operation that w takes over some claims of v and in return gives liquidity to v to ultimately rescue v. We study the structural properties and computational complexity of decision and optimization problems for several variants of claims trading.   When trading incoming edges of v, we show that there is no trade in which both banks v and w strictly improve their assets. We therefore consider creditor-positive trades, in which v profits strictly and w remains indifferent. For a given set C of incoming edges of v, ",

    "translated_abstract": "最近银行危机再次强调了了解和减轻金融网络中系统性风险的重要性。本文研究了一种基于索赔交易理念的市场驱动方法来拯救处于困境的银行，该理念在美国破产法典第11章中有定义。我们将这一理念在金融网络背景下进行了形式化，由Eisenberg和Noe提出。针对给定的两家银行v和w，我们考虑了w接管v的一些索赔然后换取给予v流动性以最终拯救v的操作。我们研究了索赔交易的多个变体的决策和优化问题的结构特性和计算复杂度。在交易v的入边时，我们证明不存在一种交易能让两家银行v和w的资产都得到严格提升。因此，我们考虑了债权人积极的交易，其中v的利润增加而w保持不变。对于给定的v的一组入边C，",
