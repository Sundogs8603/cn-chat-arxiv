    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯网络模型描述了不确定性下随机变量之间的关系，可用于预测事件和结果的可能性，并结合观察到的证据。从可解释人工智能（XAI）的角度来看，这种模型具有紧凑性，而且捕获的关系可以直接由领域专家检查。然而，在实践中，数据往往是实值的。除非可以假设正态性，否则通常需要进行离散化。然而，最佳离散化取决于模型化的变量之间的关系。这增加了从数据中学习贝叶斯网络的复杂性。基于Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm（GOMEA）的现有最先进结构学习方法，我们在本工作中扩展了这一方法，以共同学习变量离散化。",
