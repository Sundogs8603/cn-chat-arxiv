Firstly, we design a pixel-wise distribution matching loss to measure the differences in the pixel-wise density distributions between the prediction and the ground truth; Secondly, we enhance the transformer decoder by using density tokens to specialize the forwards of decoders w.r.t. different density intervals; Thirdly, we design the interleaving consistency self-supervised learning mechanism to learn from unlabeled data efficiently.

    "translated_abstract": "本文关注半监督人群计数，仅有少量标记的训练数据可用。我们将像素级密度值建模为概率分布，而不是单一确定的值进行回归。在此基础上，我们提出了一种半监督人群计数模型。首先，我们设计了一个逐像素分布匹配损失，用于衡量预测和真实密度分布之间的差异；其次，我们通过使用密度标记来增强变压器解码器，使解码器的前向针对不同密度区间有所专门化；第三，我们设计了交错一致性自监督学习机制，以有效地从未标记的数据中学习。对四个数据集进行了大量实验，结果表明我们的方法在各种标记比例设置下明显优于竞争对手。代码将发布在 https://g",
