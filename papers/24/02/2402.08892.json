In this paper, we propose a Weakly supervised Iterative Spinal Segmentation (WISS) method leveraging only four corner landmark weak labels on a single sagittal slice to achieve automatic volumetric segmentation from CT images for VBs. WISS first segments VBs on an annotated sagittal slice in an iterative self-training manner. This self-training method alternates between training and refining labels in the training set.

    "translated_abstract": "椎体（VB）分割是脊柱疾病医学视觉诊断的重要预处理步骤。然而，大多数先前的研究需要像素/体素级别的强监督，这对于专家来说是昂贵、繁琐和耗时的。在本文中，我们提出了一种弱监督迭代脊柱分割（WISS）方法，仅利用单个矢状切片上的四个角标记点来从CT图像中实现VB的自动体积分割。WISS首先采用自我训练的方式，在有注释的矢状切片上分割VB。这种自我训练的方法在训练集中交替进行训练和细化标签。然后，WISS使用切片传播方法逐层切片地进行整个VB的分割，获得体积分割结果。",
