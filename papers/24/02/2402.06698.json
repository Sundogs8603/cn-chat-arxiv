To address this challenge, we introduce a large-scale financial dataset, namely, Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset (FNSPID).

    "translated_abstract": "金融市场预测利用历史数据来预测未来的股票价格和市场趋势。传统上，这些预测主要集中在对数量因素的统计分析，如股票价格、交易量、通胀率和工业生产变动等。大型语言模型的最新进展激发了对情感数据（尤其是市场新闻）和数值因素进行整合性金融分析的兴趣。然而，由于缺乏综合数量和质量情感分析的大规模数据集，这种方法常常受到限制。为了应对这一挑战，我们介绍了一个大规模的金融数据集，即金融新闻和股票价格整合数据集（FNSPID）。它包括4,775家标普500指数公司从1999年到2023年期间的2970万个股票价格和1570万个时间对齐的金融新闻记录，数据来源于4个股票市场新闻网站。我们证明了FNSPID可以很好地用于金融市场预测。",
