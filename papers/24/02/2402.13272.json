Drawing from research in computer science, cognitive science, and related disciplines, we contrast prompted ToM with what we call spontaneous ToM -- reasoning about others' mental states that is grounded in unintentional, possibly uncontrollable cognitive functions. We argue for a principled approach to studying and developing AI ToM and suggest that a robust, or general, ASI will respond to prompts \\textit{and} spontaneously engage in social reasoning.",

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能领域现有的心灵理论（ToM）方法过分强调启发式或基于线索的ToM，可能限制我们发展人工社会智能（ASI）的集体能力。借鉴计算机科学、认知科学和相关学科的研究，我们将启发式ToM与我们所称的自发ToM进行对比 - 即关于他人心智状态的推理，基于无意识、可能无法控制的认知功能。我们主张对研究和发展AI ToM采取原则性的方法，并建议健全的或通用的ASI将对提示作出回应，并自发地参与社会推理。",
    "tldr": "论文提出了人工智能中自发心灵理论的概念，强调了自发ToM相对于启发式ToM的重要性，并主张发展AI ToM需要采取原则性方法，以实现更具弹性的人工社会智能。"
