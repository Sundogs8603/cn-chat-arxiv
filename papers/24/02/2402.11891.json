    "translated_abstract": "联合搜索系统聚合来自多个搜索引擎的结果，选择合适的来源以增强结果质量并与用户意图保持一致。随着检索增强生成（RAG）管道的日益流行，联合搜索可以在跨异构数据源中搜索相关信息以生成明智的响应起到关键作用。然而，现有数据集（如过去的TREC FedWeb跟踪中开发的数据集）过时了，缺乏对现代信息检索挑战的代表性。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了FeB4RAG，这是一个专门为RAG框架内的联合搜索而设计的新数据集。这个数据集源自广泛使用的beir基准集的16个子集合，包括了为聊天机器人应用量身定制的790个信息请求（类似于对话查询），以及每个资源返回的最佳结果以及相关的LLM-der",
