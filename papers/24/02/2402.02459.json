    "translated_abstract": "维度降低方法，例如主成分分析（PCA）和因子分析，在数据科学中是很常用的。然而，对于具有显著异方差噪声的数据，寻找稳健的低维逼近存在明显且被广泛接受的挑战。本文介绍了最小化迹因子分析（MTFA）的放松版本，这是一种凸优化方法，其根源可以追溯到1940年Ledermann的工作。这种放松方法在不过度拟合异方差扰动方面特别有效，解决了因素分析中经常被提到的Heywood案例和最近发现的现有谱方法中\"病态诅咒\"问题。我们在所得低秩子空间的精确度和所提算法的收敛速度上提供了理论保证。我们发现了与现有方法（包括HeteroPCA，Lasso和Soft-Impute）的一些有趣联系，以填补一些空白。",
