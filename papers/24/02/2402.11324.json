    "translated_abstract": "现实世界信息的动态性要求对大型语言模型（LLMs）进行高效的知识编辑（KE）以进行知识更新。然而，目前的KE方法通常操作于（主体，关系，客体）三元组，忽略了上下文信息和不同知识之间的关系。这种编辑方法可能遇到不确定的编辑边界，导致大量相关知识存在歧义：事先可以回答的查询在编辑后无法可靠地回答。本文通过引入一个KE的理论框架来分析这个问题，强调了一组被忽视的知识，这些知识在编辑过程中保持不变，并在编辑过程中进行知识推断，我们将其命名为演绎锚点。我们进一步通过提出一种新颖的基于事件的知识编辑任务来解决这个问题，该任务将事实与事件描述配对。这一任务不仅体现了对真实世界的更紧密模拟",
