    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了结构化平均交集-联盟比（STRUCT-IOU），这是一种句法分析树之间的相似性度量指标，受到了评估语音解析器问题的启发。STRUCT-IOU使得可以比较在自动识别的口语词边界上的组块分析树与基准解析（在书面词上）之间的差异。为了计算这个指标，我们通过强制对齐将基准解析树投影到语音领域，将投影的基准成分与预测的成分在一定的结构约束下对齐，然后计算所有对齐成分对之间的平均IOU分数。STRUCT-IOU考虑了词边界，并克服了预测的词和基准事实可能没有完美一一对应的挑战。扩展到文本组块分析的评估，我们展示STRUCT-IOU表现出更高的对句法合理解析的容忍度。",
