    "translated_abstract": "最近几年图像研究集中关注了去模糊网络。然而，由于缺乏像素对齐的训练三元组（背景图像、模糊图像和模糊热图）以及模糊图像中所固有的信息限制，它们在现实世界的去模糊，尤其是运动模糊方面的实际应用仍然受到限制。本文提出了一个简单而高效的框架，利用惯性测量单元（IMU）数据合成和恢复运动模糊图像。值得注意的是，该框架包括一种用于生成训练三元组的策略，以及一种用于恢复模糊图像的陀螺仪辅助运动去模糊（GAMD）网络。其理论基础在于通过利用IMU数据，我们可以确定图像曝光阶段相机姿态的变换，从而推断出三维空间内每个点的运动轨迹（即模糊轨迹）。因此，使用我们的策略获得的合成三元组与自然运动模糊紧密相关。",
