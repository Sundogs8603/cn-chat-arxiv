    "translated_abstract": "鉴于生物医学出版物的丰富，我们引入了一项情感分析任务来理解食品与健康之间的关系。之前将健康纳入食谱推荐和分析系统的尝试主要集中在食材营养成分上，或者利用基于标记数据的基本计算模型进行训练。捕捉食材和生物医学概念之间固有关系的增强模型对于食品相关研究更有益处，鉴于生物医学文本中的丰富信息。考虑到昂贵的数据标记过程，这些模型应该有效利用标记和未标记的数据。本文介绍了一项名为实体关系情感分析（ERSA）的新任务，该任务基于实体对捕捉文本的情感。ERSA扩展了广泛研究的基于方面的情感分析（ABSA）任务。具体而言，我们的研究集中在应用于生物医学文本的ERSA任务上，重点关注(entity-ent",
