    "translated_abstract": "基于深度卷积神经网络（CNN）的方法在视频抠像方面取得了很好的性能。许多这些方法可以为目标主体产生准确的 alpha 估计，但通常会生成模糊或不正确的目标边缘。这通常是由以下原因引起的：1）当前的方法总是不加区分地处理目标主体和边缘；2）目标主体在整个目标中占据了主导地位，只有很小的比例是目标边缘。针对第一个问题，我们提出了一个基于CNN的模块，分别优化抠像的目标主体和边缘（SOBE）。基于此，我们引入了一种实时、无需修剪图的视频抠像方法——POBEVM，相比之前的方法它更轻量级，并在预测的目标边缘方面取得了显著改进。针对第二个问题，我们提出了一个边缘L1损失（ELL）函数，强制将我们的网络应用于抠像的目标主体.",
