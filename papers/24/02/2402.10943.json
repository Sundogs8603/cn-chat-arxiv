    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.10943v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work presents an accuracy study of the open source OCR engine, Kraken, on the leading Arabic scholarly journal, al-Abhath. In contrast with other commercially available OCR engines, Kraken is shown to be capable of producing highly accurate Arabic-script OCR. The study also assesses the relative accuracy of typeface-specific and generalized models on the al-Abhath data and provides a microanalysis of the ``error instances'' and the contextual features that may have contributed to OCR misrecognition. Building on this analysis, the paper argues that Arabic-script OCR can be significantly improved through (1) a more systematic approach to training data production, and (2) the development of key technological components, especially multi-language models and improved line segmentation and layout analysis.

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了对开源OCR引擎Kraken在领先的阿拉伯学术期刊al-Abhath上的准确性研究。与其他商业OCR引擎相比，Kraken表现出能够生成非常准确的阿拉伯文本OCR的能力。研究还评估了al-Abhath数据上特定字体和广义模型的相对准确性，并对“错误实例”进行了微观分析以及可能导致OCR错误识别的上下文特征。基于这一分析，论文提出，通过更加系统的训练数据生产方法以及关键技术组件的开发（特别是多语言模型和改进的线段分割和布局分析），阿拉伯文字OCR可以得到显著改进。",
