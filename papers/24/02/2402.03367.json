    "translated_abstract": "Infineon已经确定工程师、客户经理和客户迅速获取产品信息的需求。传统上，这个问题通过检索增强生成（RAG）聊天机器人来解决，但在这项研究中，我评估了新近流行的RAG-Fusion方法的使用。RAG-Fusion将RAG和互惠排名融合（RRF）相结合，通过生成多个查询，使用互惠分数对其进行再排序，并融合文档和分数。通过对准确性、相关性和全面性进行手动评估，我发现RAG-Fusion能够通过从不同的角度对原始查询进行上下文化，提供准确和全面的回答。然而，当生成的查询与原始查询的相关性不足时，有些答案偏离了主题。这项研究在人工智能（AI）和自然语言处理（NLP）应用方面取得了重要进展，并展示了全球和区域之间的变革。",
