    "translated_abstract": "已经提出了几种表示共同分布分类变量之间特定背景下关系的方法，并且提出了结构学习算法。然而，由于大量特定背景模型的存在，现有的基于优化的方法在可扩展性方面受到限制，而基于约束的方法比约束DAG学习算法更容易出错，因为必须测试更多关系。我们提出了一种混合算法来学习特定背景模型，能够扩展到数百个变量，并且测试的约束不多于标准DAG学习算法。通过结合基于顺序的MCMC算法和类似于DAG模型常用的稀疏性假设，实现了可扩展的学习。为了实现这种方法，我们解决了Alon和Balogh最近提出的一个开放问题的特殊情况。经过在合成数据和真实世界示例上的实验证明，该方法在准确性和可扩展性方面表现良好。",
