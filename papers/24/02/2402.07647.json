    "translated_abstract": "我们致力于解决构建复杂实际任务的实际多模态助手的难题。我们描述了开发和部署GRILLBot的实践性和挑战性，该系统是Alexa Prize TaskBot挑战赛中获得第一和第二名的系统（分别在2022年和2023年）。在我们的开放助手工具包（OAT）框架的基础上，我们提出了一种混合架构，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和为需要非常低延迟的特定子任务调优的专门模型。OAT使我们能够以结构化且可部署的方式定义何时、如何以及使用哪些LLMs。对于知识驱动的问题回答和实时任务调整，我们展示了LLM在任务背景和世界知识上的推理能力超过延迟问题。对于对话状态管理，我们实现了一种代码生成方法，并展示了专门的较小模型具有84％的有效性和100倍的低延迟。总体而言，我们提供了洞见，并讨论了权衡选择。",
