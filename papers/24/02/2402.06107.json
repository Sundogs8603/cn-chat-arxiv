    "translated_abstract": "2019年冠状病毒病流行疫情的蔓延导致许多课程和考试变成在线形式。考试监考系统中的作弊行为检测模型在保证远程考试的公平性方面起着重要作用。然而，作弊行为很少见，大多数研究者在作弊行为检测任务中没有全面考虑头部姿势、凝视角度、身体姿势和背景信息等特征。在本文中，我们开发并提出了CHEESE，一种基于多实例学习的作弊检测框架。该框架包括实现弱监督的标签生成器和学习判别性特征的特征编码器。此外，该框架还将3D卷积提取的身体姿势和背景特征与OpenFace 2.0捕获的眼睛凝视、头部姿势和面部特征相结合。通过拼接，这些特征被送入时空图模块进行分析。",
