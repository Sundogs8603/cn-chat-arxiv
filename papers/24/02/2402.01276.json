    "abstract": "This paper explores the multifaceted consequences of federated unlearning (FU) with data heterogeneity. We introduce key metrics for FU assessment, concentrating on verification, global stability, and local fairness, and investigate the inherent trade-offs. Furthermore, we formulate the unlearning process with data heterogeneity through an optimization framework. Our key contribution lies in a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the trade-offs in FU and provides insights into data heterogeneity's impacts on FU. Leveraging these insights, we propose FU mechanisms to manage the trade-offs, guiding further development for FU mechanisms. We empirically validate that our FU mechanisms effectively balance trade-offs, confirming insights derived from our theoretical analysis.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了在数据异构性情况下联邦取消学习（FU）的多方面影响。我们介绍了FU评估的关键指标，重点关注验证，全局稳定性和局部公平性，并研究了内在的权衡。此外，我们通过一个优化框架对具有数据异构性的取消学习过程进行了形式化。我们的核心贡献在于对FU中权衡进行了全面的理论分析，并提供了数据异构性对FU的影响的见解。利用这些见解，我们提出了管理权衡的FU机制，为FU机制的进一步发展提供指导。我们通过实证验证了我们的FU机制有效地平衡了权衡，确认了从我们的理论分析中得出的见解。",
