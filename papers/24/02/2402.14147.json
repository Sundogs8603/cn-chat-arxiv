    "translated_abstract": "AI工具越来越多地部署在社区环境中。然而，用于评估AI的数据集通常由开发人员和标注者在给定社区之外创建，这可能导致关于AI性能的误导性结论。我们如何赋予社区推动有意的设计和整理对其产生影响的AI评估数据集的能力？我们在维基百科上探讨了这个问题，维基百科是一个部署了多个基于AI的内容管理工具的在线社区。我们介绍了Wikibench，一个系统，使社区能够协作整理AI评估数据集，同时通过讨论来解决歧义和观点差异。在维基百科上进行的一项现场研究显示，使用Wikibench整理的数据集能有效捕捉社区共识、分歧和不确定性。此外，研究参与者使用Wikibench来塑造整体的数据整理流程，包括完善标签定义、定义",
