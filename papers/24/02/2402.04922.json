    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯优化（BO）为高效优化黑盒函数提供了一种优雅的方法。然而，采集准则需要进行具有挑战性的内部优化，这可能引起很大的开销。许多实际的BO方法，尤其是在高维情况下，不采用对采集函数进行形式化连续优化，而是在有限的空间填充候选集上进行离散搜索。在这里，我们提议使用候选点，其位于当前设计点的Voronoi镶嵌边界上，因此它们与两个或多个设计点等距离。我们讨论了通过直接采样Voronoi边界而不明确生成镶嵌的策略，从而适应高维度中的大设计。通过使用高斯过程和期望改进来对一组测试问题进行优化，我们的方法在不损失准确性的情况下显著提高了多起始连续搜索的执行时间。",
