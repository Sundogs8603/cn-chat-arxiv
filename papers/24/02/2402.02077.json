    "translated_abstract": "知识驱动的对话生成是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为它需要同时满足两个基本但常常相互竞争的约束条件：响应性和可归因于潜在源文档。在这项工作中，我们将这两个目标（特定性和归因度）之间的权衡问题提出并问了一个问题：在响应生成之前进行明确的内容规划是否可以帮助模型解决这个挑战？为了回答这个问题，我们设计了一个名为PLEDGE的框架，它允许我们在先前工作中探索过的各种计划变量上进行实验，支持既不依赖度量也依赖度量的方法。尽管内容规划显示出希望，但我们在是否可以帮助解决这一权衡问题方面的结果是混合的-在度量感知的规划机制（在训练过程中使用自动度量）方面在自动评估中表现更好，但在人工判断中表现不佳。",
