    "translated_abstract": "生成AI图像的出现完全颠覆了艺术界。从人类艺术中识别AI生成的图像是一个具有挑战性的问题，其影响随着时间的推移而不断增加。未能解决这个问题会导致不良行为者欺诈那些支付高价购买人类艺术品的个人和禁止使用AI图像的公司。这对于需要过滤训练数据以避免潜在模型崩溃的AI模型训练者来说也至关重要。区分人类艺术和AI图像的方法有多种，包括通过监督学习训练的分类器，针对扩散模型的研究工具，以及通过专业艺术家利用他们对艺术技巧的知识进行识别。在本文中，我们试图了解这些方法在现代生成模型的良性和对抗性环境中的表现如何。我们策划了7种风格的真实人类艺术，从5个生成模型生成了与之匹配的图像，并应用了8个检测器。",
