    "translated_abstract": "生成性扩散模型和许多科学和工程中的随机模型在离散化之前自然地存在于无穷维空间中。为了将观测数据纳入统计和学习任务中，需要对观测值进行条件约束。近期的研究已经处理了在无穷维空间中对线性过程进行条件约束的问题，但尚未探索在无穷维空间中对非线性过程进行条件约束的方法。本文提出了一种在无先验离散化的情况下对函数值随机过程进行条件约束的方法。为此，我们使用了Girsanov定理的无穷维版本来对函数值随机过程进行条件约束，从而得到了涉及得分的条件过程的随机微分方程(SDE)。我们将这种技术应用于进化生物学中的生物形态时间序列分析中，通过Fourier基函数离散化，然后利用得分匹配方法学习得分函数的系数。",
