    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个使用贝叶斯滤波的经验分析框架，具体关注具有多个状态的动态随机一般均衡（DSGE）模型的状态空间形式。我们概述了模型估计的理论基础，提供了两个强大的多状态滤波器族——IMM和GPB的详细信息，并构建了相应的多状态平滑器。基于一个典型的新凯恩斯DSGE模型的仿真实验，我们证明了所提出的滤波器和平滑器的计算稳健性，并评估了它们在每个家族中的一系列滤波器中的准确性和速度。我们发现，经典的IMM滤波器在IMM和GPB家族中都更快且准确性不低，而且往往更高，后者包括通常使用的Kim和Nelson（1999）滤波器。将其与匹配的平滑器配对使用可以提高对未观测变量的恢复精度。",
