    "translated_abstract": "自从Transformers模型在自然语言处理（NLP）领域取得突破以来，该模型已在各个领域进行了多种改进。 这一趋势已经传播到音乐信息检索（MIR）领域，包括处理音乐数据的研究。 但是，在MIR中，利用NLP工具处理符号音乐数据的做法并不新颖。 音乐经常被比作语言，因为它们具有多个相似之处，包括文本和音乐的序列化表示。 这些类比还通过MIR和NLP中的类似任务得到体现。 本文综述了应用于符号音乐生成和信息检索研究的NLP方法，遵循两个方面。我们首先概述了从自然语言序列表示中改编而来的符号音乐表示。 通过考虑符号音乐的特定性来设计这些表示。 然后这些表示被模型处理。",
