    "translated_abstract": "机器学习中长期存在的一个挑战是解决训练和测试数据之间的巨大分布差异，这导致了迁移学习和领域自适应等领域的出现。最近，连续领域适应（CDA）作为一种有效技术出现，通过利用一系列中间域来弥合这一差距。本文提出了一种新颖的CDA方法W-MPOT，严格解决了先前研究忽视的领域排序和错误累积问题。具体而言，我们基于Wasserstein距离在源域和中间域上构建了一个传递课程，这受到了对CDA的理论分析的启发。然后，我们通过一个修改版的连续最优传输，在课程中的多条有效路径上将源模型转移到目标域。引入了一个双向路径一致性约束，以减轻连续过程中映射错误累积的影响。",
