Many recent studies quantify LLMs' personalities using self-assessment tests that are created for humans.

    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLMs）迅速与人类日常应用整合，关于LLMs行为的许多社会和伦理关切被提出。了解LLMs行为的一种方式是分析它们的人格。许多最近的研究使用为人类创建的自我评估测试来量化LLMs的人格。然而，许多批评质疑将这些自我评估测试应用于LLMs时的适用性和可靠性。在本文中，我们使用一种替代的人格测量方法来研究LLMs的人格，我们将其称为外部评估方法，这里我们不是通过在李克特量表上提示LLMs回答多选题，而是通过分析LLMs对外部机器学习模型提出的开放式情境问题的回答来评估LLMs的人格。我们首先对Llama2-7B模型进行微调，作为MBTI人格预测器，该预测器优于最先进的",
