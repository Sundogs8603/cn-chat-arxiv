A dataset specially designed for generating R program code was constructed with metadata to support scenario-based testing and evaluation of code generation capabilities in various usage scenarios of different levels of difficulty and different types of programs. The evaluation takes a multiple attempt process in which the tester tries to complete the code generation task through a number of attempts until a satisfactory solution is obtained or gives up after a fixed number of maximal attempts. In each attempt the tester formulates a natural language input to ChatGPT based on the previous results and the task to be completed. In addition to the metrics of average numbers of attempts and average amount of time taken to complete the tasks, the final generated solutions are then assessed on a number of quality attributes, including accuracy, completeness, concise",

    "translated_abstract": "本文报告了对ChatGPT从自然语言输入生成R编程语言代码能力的评估。构建了一个专门用于生成R程序代码的数据集，以支持基于场景的测试和评估在不同难度级别和不同类型程序的各种使用情境中的代码生成能力。评估采用多次尝试的过程，测试人员通过多次尝试来完成代码生成任务，直至获得满意的解决方案或达到最大尝试次数后放弃。每次尝试中，测试人员根据先前的结果和待完成的任务制定自然语言输入给ChatGPT。除了平均尝试次数和平均完成任务所需的时间指标外，最终生成的解决方案将根据精确性、完整性、简洁性等多个质量属性进行评估。",
