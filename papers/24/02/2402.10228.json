    "translated_abstract": "为了在资源约束下解决复杂任务，强化学习（RL）代理需要简单、高效、可扩展、具有大状态空间和不断积累的交互数据。我们提出了HyperAgent，这是一个具有超模型、索引抽样方案和增量更新机制的RL框架，可以在一般价值函数逼近中进行计算高效的顺序后验逼近和数据高效的动作选择，超越了共轭性。HyperAgent的实现简单，只需要在DDQN中添加一个模块和一行额外代码。在实践中，HyperAgent在大规模深度RL基准测试中表现出稳健的性能，无论是在数据还是计算方面都获得了显着的效率提升。在理论上，在实际可扩展的算法中，HyperAgent是第一个能够实现可证明可扩展的每步计算复杂度以及次线性后悔的方法。",
