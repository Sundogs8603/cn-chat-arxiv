    "translated_abstract": "我们描述了一组新的方法，可以在一定程度上自动化语言系统演化的推断，这些方法依赖于(1)同源词集及其相应的原型形式和音变规律，(2)从音素到其发音特征的映射以及(3)一种声音变化的类型学数据库。我们通过训练神经网络利用这些声音变化数据来权衡音素之间的发音差距，并预测历史上的原型形式与其现代后代之间的中间声音变化步骤，从而在该方法中部分代替了语言学专家。在我们对图卡诺亚语言的最佳实验中，该方法生成的树与使用专家注释的树相比，具有0.12的广义四分距，这是其他半自动基线的显著改进。我们讨论了我们的神经方法和基于简洁原则的树预测的潜在优势和劣势。我们还尝试了最小泛化学习器进行自动音变规律归纳的实验，发现其与语言学家的归纳结果相当。",
