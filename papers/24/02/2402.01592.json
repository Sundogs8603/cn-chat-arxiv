    "translated_abstract": "员工的健康是当代工作场所的一个关键问题，正如美国心理学协会2021年的报告所指出的，71%的员工会经历压力或紧张。这种压力对工作场所的离职率和缺勤率产生了显著影响，61%的离职和16%的病假归因于心理健康状况不佳。雇主面临的一个主要挑战是员工通常在达到危机点之前都不知道自己的心理健康问题，导致对企业福利待遇的利用有限。本研究通过提出一种前所未有的压力检测算法来解决这个挑战，该算法可以提供实时的支持。利用自动聊天机器人技术，该算法通过分析聊天对话客观地测量心理健康水平，并根据语言生物标志提供个性化的实时治疗建议。本研究探讨了将这些创新技术整合到企业环境中的可行性。",
