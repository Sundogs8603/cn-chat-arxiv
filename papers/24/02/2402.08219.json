    "translated_abstract": "适应最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs），如GPT-4和Gemini，以满足特定任务的要求是具有挑战性的。由于它们的参数、嵌入和输出概率的不透明性，现有的微调适应方法是不适用的。因此，只能通过它们的API服务适应这些黑盒LLMs，这引发了透明度、隐私和成本的担忧。为了解决这些挑战，我们介绍了BBox-Adapter，一种新颖的适用于黑盒LLMs的轻量级适配器。BBox-Adapter通过将目标数据视为正样本，将源数据视为负样本来区分目标和源域数据。它采用基于排名的噪音对比估计（NCE）损失来提高目标域数据的可能性，同时惩罚源域数据的可能性。此外，它还具有在线适应机制，该机制将来自真实数据、人类或AI反馈的实时正样本采样与先前适应的负样本数据相结合。广泛的实验表明，BBox-Adapter在不降低性能的同时，提供了高效而灵活的黑盒LLMs适应解决方案。",
