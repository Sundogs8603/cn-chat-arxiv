    "translated_abstract": "对于推荐系统来说，给与冷启动用户高质量的推荐结果一直是一个挑战。解决目标领域中冷启动用户数据稀疏问题的一个潜在解决方案是从辅助领域添加数据。找到一种合适的方法从辅助领域提取知识并将其转移到目标领域是跨域推荐（CDR）研究的主要目标之一。在现有的方法中，映射方法是一种流行的方法来实现跨域推荐模型（CDRs）。对于这种类型的模型，映射模块起着将数据从一个域转换到另一个域的作用。它主要决定了映射方法CDRs的性能。最近，扩散概率模型（DPMs）在图像合成相关任务中取得了令人印象深刻的成功。它们涉及从添加噪声的样本中恢复图像，这可以看作是具有出色性能的数据转换过程。",
