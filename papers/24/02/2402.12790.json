This paper tackles a well-known gap in the field, which is the lack of testing in the applicability and reliability of XAI evaluation metrics in the skeleton-based HAR domain. We have tested established XAI metrics namely faithfulness and stability on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to address this problem. The study also introduces a perturbation method that respects human biomechanical constraints to ensure realistic variations in human movement. Our findings indicate that \\textit{faithfulness} may not be a reliable metric in certain contexts, such as with the EfficientGCN model. Conversely, stability emerges as a more dependable metric when there is slight input data perturbations. CAM and Grad-C",

    "translated_abstract": "3D骨架数据中深度学习在人类活动识别（HAR）中的进展对医疗、安全、体育和人机交互应用至关重要。本文解决了该领域一个众所周知的问题，即在基于骨架的HAR领域中缺乏XAI评估指标的适用性和可靠性测试。我们在类激活映射（CAM）和梯度加权类激活映射（Grad-CAM）上测试了已建立的XAI评估指标，即忠实度和稳定性，以解决这一问题。该研究还引入一种尊重人体生物力学约束的扰动方法，以确保人类运动中的现实变化。我们的研究结果表明，在某些情境下，如EfficientGCN模型中，\\textit{忠实度}可能不是一个可靠的指标。相反，当存在轻微输入数据扰动时，稳定性更可靠。CAM和Grad-CAM",
