During this pandemic, numerous studies have focused on gaining insights into health-related perspectives from social media. In this study, our primary objective is to develop a machine learning-based web application for automatically classifying COVID-19-related discussions on social media. To achieve this, we label COVID-19-related Twitter data, provide benchmark classification results, and develop a web application. We collected data using the Twitter API and labeled a total of 6,667 tweets into five different classes: health risks, prevention, symptoms, transmission, and treatment. We extracted features using various feature extraction methods and applied them to seven different traditional machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adaboost, K-Nearest Neighbour, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVC.
