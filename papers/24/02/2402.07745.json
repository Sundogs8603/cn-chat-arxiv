    "translated_abstract": "现代大众市场应用中的机器学习模型经常会随时间进行更新。面临的一个主要挑战是，尽管整体性能在提升，但这些更新可能会以不可预测的方式改变特定模型的预测结果。在实践中，研究人员通过量化模型更新前后的不稳定预测数量来衡量预测性流失。本文通过预测性多样性的角度研究了这种效应，即在一组接近最优模型（Rashomon集合）中存在冲突预测的普遍性。我们展示了如何利用传统的预测性多样性度量来研究这组潜在模型的预期流失，即可能用于替换基线模型在部署中的模型集合。我们从不同的角度给出了模型集内Rashomon集合之间预期流失的理论结果，并通过Rashomon集合表征了模型更新中的预期流失，结合我们的分析结果。",
