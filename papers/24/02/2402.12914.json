Despite this, LLM-based agents frequently demonstrate notable shortcomings in adjusting to dynamic environments and fully grasping human needs. In this work, we introduce the problem of LLM-based human-agent collaboration for complex task-solving, exploring their synergistic potential. In addition, we propose a Reinforcement Learning-based Human-Agent Collaboration method, ReHAC.

    "translated_abstract": "在最近的研究中，将大型语言模型（LLMs）整合到创建完全自主代理人中引起了极大的兴趣。然而，基于LLM的代理人经常表现出在适应动态环境和完全把握人类需求方面的明显缺点。在这项工作中，我们引入了基于LLM的人-机协作进行复杂任务求解的问题，探讨它们的协同潜力。此外，我们提出了一种基于强化学习的人-机协作方法ReHAC。该方法包括一个策略模型，旨在确定人类何时介入任务求解过程中最合适的阶段。我们构建了一个人-机协作数据集，用于在离线强化学习环境中训练这个策略模型。我们的验证测试证实了模型的有效性。结果表明，人类和LLM的协同努力-",
