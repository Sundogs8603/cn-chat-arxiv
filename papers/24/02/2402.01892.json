Our findings reveal that wishful thinking behavior can be accurately characterized as equivalent to superquantile-utility maximization within the domain of threshold beliefs distortion cost functions. By leveraging this equivalence, we establish conditions that elucidate when an optimistic decision-maker exhibits a preference for choices characterized by positive skewness and increased risk.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个模型，阐明了美好幻想的本质，综合考虑了偏见信念所带来的成本和收益。我们的研究结果表明，美好幻想行为可以准确地描述为在偏见信念扭曲成本函数领域内进行超型效用最大化。通过利用这种等价性，我们得出了当一个乐观的决策者偏好于具有正偏态和增加风险特征的选择的条件。",
