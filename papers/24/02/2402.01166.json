    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人工智能生成内容（AIGC）取得了显著的进展，具有多种输入模态，如文本、图像、视频、音频和三维。三维是最接近真实世界三维环境的可视模态，并具有巨大的知识量。三维内容生成不仅具有学术和实践价值，而且面临着巨大的技术挑战。本综述旨在整合三维内容生成领域的发展。具体而言，提出了一种新的分类法，将现有方法分为三类：三维本机生成方法、基于二维先验的三维生成方法和混合三维生成方法。本综述涵盖了约60篇涵盖主要技术的论文。此外，我们讨论了当前三维内容生成技术的局限性，并指出了未来工作的挑战和有希望的方向。配合本综述，我们建立了一个项目网站，其中包含了相关资源和代码。",
