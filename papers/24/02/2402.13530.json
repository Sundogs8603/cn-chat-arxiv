    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.13530v1 公告类型: 跨领域 摘要: 当今的在线决策者通常可以获得关于未来变量的预测，如到达、需求、库存等。这些预测可以由简单的单变量时间序列预测算法生成，一直到利用多个时间序列和附加特征信息的最先进的机器学习模型。然而，预测质量通常对决策者来说是未知的，因此盲目地遵循预测可能是有害的。本文通过给出将预测作为输入并针对未知预测质量进行稳健执行的算法来解决这个问题。我们考虑在线资源分配问题，这是收益管理和在线决策制定中最通用的模型之一。在这个问题中，决策者拥有有限数量的资源，并且请求是顺序到来的。对于每个请求，决策者需要决定采取何种行动。",
