Multimodal Large Language models have developed rapidly in recent years and is promising in news image captioning task. However, according to our experiments, common MLLMs are not good at generating the entities in zero-shot setting. Their abilities to deal with the entities information are still limited after simply fine-tuned on news image captioning dataset. To obtain a more powerful model to handle the multimodal entity information, we design two multimodal entity-aware alignment tasks and an alignment framework to align the model and generate the news image captions. Our method achieves better results than previous state-of-the-art models in CIDEr score (72.33 -> 86.29) on GoodNews dataset and (70.83 -> 85.61) on NYTimes800k dataset.",

    "translated_abstract": "新闻图像字幕生成任务是图像字幕生成任务的一个变体，要求模型生成一个更具信息性的字幕，其中包含新闻图像和相关新闻文章。近年来，多模态大型语言模型发展迅速，并在新闻图像字幕生成任务中表现出前景。然而，根据我们的实验，常见的多模态大型语言模型在零样本设定下生成实体方面表现不佳。即使在新闻图像字幕生成数据集上进行简单微调，它们处理实体信息的能力仍然有限。为了获得一个更强大的模型来处理多模态实体信息，我们设计了两个多模态实体感知对齐任务和一个对齐框架，以对齐模型并生成新闻图像字幕。我们的方法在GoodNews数据集上将CIDEr分数提高到86.29（从72.33），在NYTimes800k数据集上将其提高到85.61（从70.83），优于先前的最先进模型。",
