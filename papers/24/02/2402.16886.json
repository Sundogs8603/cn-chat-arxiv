    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现是令人兴奋的，并已在许多领域找到应用，但通常情况下，医学领域的标准要求非常高。与LLMs配合使用，向量嵌入模型和向量数据库提供了一种强大的方式来表达各种数据模式，这些数据模式容易被典型的机器学习模型所理解。除了方便地向这些向量数据库添加信息、知识和数据外，它们还提供了一个令人信服的理由，即将其应用于通常由人类完成的检索信息任务的各种领域。Google的研究人员开发了一个清晰的替代模型Med-PaLM，专门旨在与临床医师的医学知识水平匹配。在训练分类器和开发模型时，保持事实和减少偏见是至关重要的。在本文中，我们探讨了向量数据库和嵌入模型的应用",
