To identify concrete objects in complex scenes, humans instinctively rely on deictic descriptions in natural language, i.e., referring to something depending on the context such as \"The object that is on the desk and behind the cup.\". However, deep learning approaches cannot reliably interpret such deictic representations due to their lack of reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios. To remedy this issue, we propose DeiSAM -- a combination of large pre-trained neural networks with differentiable logic reasoners -- for deictic promptable segmentation. Given a complex, textual segmentation description, DeiSAM leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate first-order logic rules and performs differentiable forward reasoning on generated scene graphs.

    "translated_abstract": "大规模、预训练的神经网络已经在各种任务中展现出强大的能力，包括零-shot图像分割。为了在复杂场景中识别具体对象，人类本能地依赖于自然语言中的指示性描述，即根据上下文指称某物，比如“在桌子上并在杯子后面的物体”。然而，深度学习方法由于在复杂场景中缺乏推理能力，无法可靠地解释这种指示性表示。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了DeiSAM——将大型预训练神经网络与可区分逻辑推理器相结合，用于指示提示性分割。给定复杂的文本分割描述，DeiSAM利用大型语言模型（LLMs）生成一阶逻辑规则，并对生成的场景图进行可区分的前向推理。随后，DeiSAM通过匹配",
