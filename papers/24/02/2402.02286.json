    "translated_abstract": "实时语义分割对于实际应用非常重要。然而，许多方法都着重于降低计算复杂性和模型大小，但同时牺牲了准确性。在一些场景下，如自主导航和驾驶员辅助系统，准确性和速度同样重要。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的多级特征聚合和递归对齐网络（MFARANet），旨在实现高分割准确性和实时推理速度。我们使用ResNet-18作为骨干来保证效率，并提出了三个核心组件来弥补浅骨干引起的模型容量减少。具体而言，我们首先设计多级特征聚合模块（MFAM），将编码器中的分层特征聚合到每个尺度，以便于后续的空间对齐和多尺度推理。然后，我们通过结合基于流的对齐来建立递归对齐模块（RAM）。",
