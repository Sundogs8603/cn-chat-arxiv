    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在广泛任务中展现强大性能，但仍面临幻觉等可靠性挑战。先前的研究表明，像GPT-4这样高能力的LLMs在评估单个响应的可靠性方面是有效的，而较不具备能力的LLMs通常被调整来评估对相同查询的响应的相对可靠性。为了使较不具备能力的LLMs有效地评估单个响应的可靠性，我们提出了一种名为$\\textit{Meta}$ $\\textit{Ranking}$（MR）的新方法。与先前直接评估响应的方法不同，我们通过将目标查询-响应对与参考查询-响应对进行比较来实现判断。我们发现在推理任务的LLM响应的错误检测中，MR表现出显著的有效性，即使在没有微调的情况下，较不具备能力的LLMs也能胜过强基线。我们进一步证明MR可以被用",
