    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）推动了许多信息和通信技术（ICT）突破。然而，自图灵测试提议以来，ICT系统的范围已远远超出了AI。关键是，最近的AI监管提案采用了影响ICT技术、方法和系统的AI定义，而这些并不是AI。在某些情况下，甚至包括数学、统计和工程领域的作品也会受到影响。令人担忧的是，从西方社会到全球南方，都发现了AI定义上的错误。在本文中，我们提出了一个评分框架，用于衡量AI定义在监管方面的合适性。我们的在线、公开可用的VADER框架评分了应该作为AI定义的前提的覆盖范围，这些定义旨在（i）重现其他成功技术监管中观察到的原则，以及（ii）包括所有的AI技术和方法，同时排除非AI的作品。关于后者，我们的评分基于一种...",
    "tldr": "本研究提出了一个评分框架，用于衡量人工智能（AI）定义在监管方面的合适性。研究旨在排除通过AI监管提案所采用的不恰当的AI定义对ICT技术、方法和非AI作品的影响，并回归到以前在其他成功技术监管中观察到的原则。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study proposes a scoring framework to assess the appropriateness of artificial intelligence (AI) definitions for regulation. The research aims to eliminate the impact of inappropriate AI definitions adopted by AI regulation proposals on ICT techniques, approaches, and non-AI works and return to principles observed in other successful technology regulations."
