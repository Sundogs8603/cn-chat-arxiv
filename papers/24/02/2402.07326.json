    "translated_abstract": "鉴于语音情感识别的重要性，近年来已经开发了许多方法来在这个领域创建有效和高效的系统。其中一种方法涉及使用预训练的Transformer，通过微调来解决这个特定问题，从而达到了高精度的结果。尽管对于增强这些系统进行了广泛的讨论和全球范围的努力，但在波斯语语音情感识别的背景中，这种创新和有效的方法的应用却得到了较少的关注。在本文中，我们回顾了语音情感识别及其背景，并着重介绍了在这一领域中使用Transformer的重要性。我们提出了两种模型，一种基于谱图，另一种基于音频本身，通过使用shEMO数据集进行微调。这些模型显著提高了以前系统的准确性，在所提到的数据集上将准确率从约65%提高到了80%。随后，为了研究多语言对这些模型的影响，我们还进行了一项实验，评估了不同语言的情感识别准确性。",
