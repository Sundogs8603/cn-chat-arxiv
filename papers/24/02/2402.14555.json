The Riccati tontine is yet another way of pooling and sharing longevity risk, but is different from competing designs in two key ways. The first is that in the Riccati tontine, the representative investor is expected -- although not guaranteed -- to receive their money back if they die, or when the tontine lapses. The second is that the underlying funds within the tontine are deliberately {\\em not} indexed to the stock market. Instead, the risky assets or underlying investments are selected so that return shocks are negatively correlated with stochastic mortality, which will maximize the expected payout to survivors. This means that during a pandemic, for example, the Riccati tontine fund's performance will be impaired ",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文介绍了一种新型的现代累积型年金，名为里卡蒂年金，以两位意大利人命名：数学家雅各博·里卡蒂（生于1676年，卒于1754年）和金融家洛伦佐·迪汤蒂（生于1602年，卒于1684年）。里卡蒂年金是另一种共同分担长寿风险的方式，但与竞争设计有两个关键不同之处。首先，在里卡蒂年金中，代表性投资者有望- 虽然不保证- 在他们死亡时或年金终止时收回投资。第二是，年金内的基金故意选择非股市指数。相反，所选择的风险资产或基础投资被设计为回报冲击与随机死亡的负相关，这将最大化生还者的预期支出。这意味着，在大流行期间，例如，里卡蒂年金基金的表现将受到损害。",
