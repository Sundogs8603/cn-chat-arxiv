The emergence of AI-generated content has paved the way for OR to overcome these constraints, demonstrating the potential for personalized outfit generation.   In pursuit of this, we introduce an innovative task named Generative Outfit Recommendation (GOR), with the goal of synthesizing a set of fashion images and assembling them to form visually harmonious outfits customized to individual users.
