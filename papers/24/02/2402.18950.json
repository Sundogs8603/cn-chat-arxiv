    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.18950v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Social media platforms are daily exhibiting millions of events. To preliminarily predict the mainstream public reaction to these events, we study trendy response prediction to automatically generate top-liked user replies to social media events. While previous works focus on generating responses without factoring in popularity, we propose Popularity-Aligned Language Models (PopALM) to distinguish responses liked by a larger audience through reinforcement learning. Recognizing the noisy labels from user \"likes\", we tailor-make curriculum learning in proximal policy optimization (PPO) to help models capture the essential samples for easy-to-hard training. In experiments, we build a large-scale Weibo dataset for trendy response prediction, and its results show that PopALM can help boost the performance of advanced language models.",

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.18950v1 公告类型：新 抽象：社交媒体平台每天都在展示数百万事件。为了初步预测对这些事件的主流公众反应，我们研究时髦的响应预测，以自动生成对社交媒体事件的热门用户回复。虽然先前的工作侧重于生成响应而不考虑受欢迎程度，我们提出了受欢迎度对齐语言模型（PopALM），通过强化学习区分受大众喜欢的回复。鉴别用户“喜欢”的嘈杂标签，我们定制了课程学习在近端策略优化（PPO）中，以帮助模型捕捉基于易到难的训练的关键样本。在实验中，我们构建了一个大规模的微博数据集用于时髦的响应预测，其结果表明PopALM可以帮助提升高级语言模型的性能。",
