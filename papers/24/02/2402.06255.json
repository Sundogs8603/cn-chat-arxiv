    "translated_abstract": "尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在各种应用中取得了巨大的成功，但它们也容易受到特定提示的影响，从而绕过内置的安全措施并提供危险或非法内容，这种现象被称为越狱行为。为了保护LLMs免受产生有害信息的影响，提出了各种防御策略，其中大多数集中在内容过滤或模型的对抗训练方面。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为Prompt Adversarial Tuning（PAT）的方法，通过训练一个防御控制机制并将其作为前缀嵌入到用户提示中来实现我们的防御策略。我们设计了一个类似对抗训练的训练过程，以实现我们的优化目标，交替更新攻击和防御控制机制。据我们所知，我们是第一个从提示调整的角度实施防御的人。一旦应用，我们的方法几乎不会影响LLMs的操作效率。实验表明我们的方法在抵御越狱行为方面具有良好的效果。",
