    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.10128v1 公告类型：跨领域 摘要：3D高斯喷洒技术的进展显著加快了3D重建和生成的速度。然而，这可能需要大量高斯函数，导致占用大量内存。本文介绍了GES（广义指数喷洒），这是一种新的表示方法，它利用广义指数函数（GEF）来建模3D场景，只需要很少的粒子来表示一个场景，因此在效率上明显优于基于高斯的喷洒方法，并且具有高斯-based utilities的即插即用替换能力。GES在理论上和实证上都得到了验证，在原则上的1D设置和逼真的3D场景中。实验证明，GEF比高斯函数更准确地表示具有锐利边缘的信号，这在高斯函数中是具有挑战性的，因为它们具有低通特性。我们的实证分析表明，GEF在拟合自然发生的信号（例如正方形、三角形）方面优于高斯函数。",
