In times of financial hardship, alleviating mortgage burdens is essential for supporting affected households. The mortgage servicing industry plays a vital role in offering this assistance, yet there has been limited research modelling the complex relationship between households and servicers. To bridge this gap, we developed an agent-based model that explores household behavior and the effectiveness of relief measures during financial distress.   Our model represents households as adaptive learning agents with realistic financial attributes. These households experience exogenous income shocks, which may influence their ability to make mortgage payments.

    "translated_abstract": "抵押贷款占美国家庭债务的最大部分，总额约为全国12万亿美元。在经济困难时期，减轻抵押贷款负担对支持受影响家庭至关重要。抵押贷款服务行业在提供这种帮助方面发挥着至关重要的作用，然而至今对于家庭与服务商之间复杂关系的建模研究仍相对有限。为了弥补这一空白，我们开发了一个代理商模型，探讨了家庭行为和金融困境中减免措施的有效性。",
