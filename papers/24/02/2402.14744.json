    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.14744v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into an agent framework for flexible and efficient personal mobility generation. LLMs overcome the limitations of previous models by efficiently processing semantic data and offering versatility in modeling various tasks. Our approach addresses the critical need to align LLMs with real-world urban mobility data, focusing on three research questions: aligning LLMs with rich activity data, developing reliable activity generation strategies, and exploring LLM applications in urban mobility. The key technical contribution is a novel LLM agent framework that accounts for individual activity patterns and motivations, including a self-consistency approach to align LLMs with real-world activity data and a retrieval-augmented strategy for interpretable activity generation. In experimental studies, comprehensive validation is performed using real-world data. This ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新方法，将大型语言模型(LLMs)集成到代理框架中，用于灵活高效的个人移动生成。LLMs通过高效处理语义数据并在建模各种任务中提供多功能性, 克服了以往模型的局限性。我们的方法解决了将LLMs与真实世界城市流动数据对齐的迫切需求, 重点关注三个研究问题: 将LLMs与丰富的活动数据对齐, 开发可靠的活动生成策略, 以及探索LLMs在城市移动中的应用。其关键技术贡献是一种新颖的LLM代理框架, 该框架考虑了个体活动模式和动机, 包括将LLMs与真实世界活动数据对齐的自洽方法和可解释活动生成的检索增强策略。在实验研究中, 使用真实世界数据进行了全面验证。",
