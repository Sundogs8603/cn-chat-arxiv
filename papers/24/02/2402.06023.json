    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新颖的方法，即决策理论引导的深度强化学习（DT-guided DRL），用于解决强化学习中固有的冷启动问题。通过整合决策理论原则，DT-guided DRL增强了智能体在复杂环境中的初始性能和鲁棒性，使得学习过程更高效可靠。我们的研究涵盖了两个主要问题背景：杆车和迷宫导航挑战。实验结果表明，决策理论的整合不仅有助于对DRL智能体进行有效的初始引导，还促进了在具有大规模和复杂状态空间的环境中更有结构和知情的探索策略。实验结果表明，与常规的DRL相比，DT-guided DRL能够提供显著更高的奖励。具体而言，在训练的初始阶段，DT-guided DRL的累积奖励增加了184%。",
