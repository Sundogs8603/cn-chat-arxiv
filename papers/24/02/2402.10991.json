    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）是一种分布式机器学习范例，允许客户端在保护隐私的同时在其数据上训练模型。现有的FL算法，如Federated Averaging（FedAvg）及其变种，在许多情况下已经被证明收敛良好。然而，这些方法需要客户端以同步方式将其本地更新上传至服务器，这在现实情况下可能会变得缓慢和不可靠。为了解决这个问题，研究人员开发了异步FL方法，允许客户端继续使用陈旧的全局模型对其本地数据进行训练。然而，大多数这些方法仅仅聚合了所有接收到的更新，而没有考虑其相对贡献，这可能导致收敛速度变慢。在本文中，我们提出了一种考虑贡献的异步FL方法，考虑了接收到的更新的陈旧程度和统计异质性。我们的方法动态调整",
