    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的\"聚类和征服\"方法，用于解决并行大规模排序和选择问题，通过利用相关信息进行聚类，以打破样本效率的瓶颈。在并行计算环境中，基于相关性的聚类可以实现O(p)的样本复杂度减少速度，这是理论上可达到的最佳减少速度。我们提出的框架是通用的，在固定预算和固定精度的范式下，可以无缝集成各种常见的排序和选择方法。它可以在无需高精确度相关估计和精确聚类的情况下实现改进。在大规模人工智能应用中，如神经结构搜索，我们的无筛选版本的方法惊人地超过了完全顺序化的基准，表现出更高的样本效率。这表明利用有价值的结构信息，如相关性，是绕过传统方法的一条可行路径。",
