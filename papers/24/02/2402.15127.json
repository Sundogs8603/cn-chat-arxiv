In this enhanced framework, the agent is not only tasked with selecting an arm at each time step, but also has the option to abstain from accepting the stochastic instantaneous reward before observing it. When opting for abstention, the agent either suffers a fixed regret or gains a guaranteed reward. Given this added layer of complexity, we ask whether we can develop efficient algorithms that are both asymptotically and minimax optimal. We answer this question affirmatively by designing and analyzing algorithms whose regrets meet their corresponding information-theoretic lower bounds.

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一个新颖的多臂赌博机问题扩展，其中包含了额外的战略元素：弃权选项。在这个增强框架中，代理不仅需要在每个时间步选择一个臂，还可以选择在观察之前放弃接受随机瞬时奖励。当选择弃权时，代理要么遭受固定的后悔，要么获得一定的奖励保证。鉴于这种额外的复杂性，我们探讨是否可以开发出既渐近又米迷诺下最优的有效算法。我们通过设计和分析算法来回答这个问题，这些算法的后悔满足相应的信息理论下限。我们的研究为弃权选项的好处提供了有价值的数量化见解，为在其他具有这种选项的在线决策问题中进一步探索奠定了基础。",
