    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在全面调查各种模型降阶（MOR）和深度学习技术在预测冲击射流对凹凸面的传热方面的有效性。扩展了先前涉及脉冲圆形射流的实验和数值研究，本研究将评估用于不同射流特性下的传热的预测代理模型（PSM）。为此，本文介绍了两种预测方法，一种采用快速傅里叶变换增强人工神经网络（FFT-ANN）来预测在恒定频率情况下的平均努塞数。此外，研究引入了Proper Orthogonal Decomposition和Long Short-Term Memory（POD-LSTM）方法来处理随机频率的冲击射流。POD-LSTM方法被证明是一种在随机频率冲击情况下预测局部传热速率的强大解决方案。",
