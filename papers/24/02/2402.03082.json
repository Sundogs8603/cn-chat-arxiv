    "translated_abstract": "视觉文本是文档和场景图像中的关键元素，在计算机视觉领域引起了广泛关注。除了视觉文本的检测和识别，视觉文本处理领域也经历了研究的激增，这得益于基础生成模型的出现。然而，由于文本与普通对象具有不同的独特属性和特征，仍然存在挑战。在我们的研究中观察到，在视觉文本处理中有效地利用这些独特的文本特征是至关重要的。在本调查中，我们提出了一个全面的、多方面的对最近进展进行分析。首先，我们引入了一个层次分类体系，涵盖从文本图像增强和恢复到文本图像操作的各个领域，然后是不同的学习范式。随后，我们对特定的文本特征进行了深入讨论，如结构、笔划、语义、风格和空间内容。",
