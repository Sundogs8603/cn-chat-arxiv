    "translated_abstract": "在大规模部署之前，对自动驾驶车辆（AVs）进行测试和评估其安全性能是至关重要的。然而，由于测试成本或时间的限制，针对特定AV模型的可接受测试成本通常会被极限制地降低。现有的测试方法严格限制的测试数目会导致测试结果的显著不确定性或挑战。本文首次将这个问题定义为“少样本测试（FST）”问题，并提出了一个系统的FST框架来解决这个挑战。为了减轻小规模测试场景中的不确定性，并优化场景利用，我们将FST问题建模为一个优化问题，并基于邻域覆盖和相似性寻找一个小的场景集合。通过利用先验信息中的代理模型（SMs），我们动态调整测试场景集合和其贡献。",
