    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的最新进展代表了人工智能（AI）和机器学习（ML）领域的一种变革性能力。然而，LLMs是通用模型，训练于广泛的文本语料库，往往难以提供特定上下文信息，尤其是在需要专业知识的领域，比如野火细节在更广泛的气候变化背景下。对于关注野火弹性和适应性的决策者和政策制定者来说，获取不仅准确而且领域特定的响应至关重要，而不是泛泛而谈。为此，我们开发了WildfireGPT，一个原型LLM代理，旨在将用户查询转化为关于野火风险的可操作见解。我们通过提供气候预测和科学文献等额外上下文信息来丰富WildfireGPT，以确保其信息具有时效性、相关性和科学准确性。这使得WildfireGPT成为一个有效的工具来解决实际问题。",
