    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）因其理解文本和图像、生成类人文本以及执行复杂推理任务的能力而受到广泛关注。然而，它们将这种高级推理与自然语言文本相结合以用于动态情况下的决策的泛化能力需要进一步探索。本研究探讨了LLMs在混合算术和常识推理方面的适应能力和应用能力，特别是在自动驾驶场景中。我们假设LLMs的混合推理能力可以通过使它们分析检测到的物体和传感器数据、理解驾驶规定和物理法则，并提供额外的语境来改善自动驾驶。这解决了复杂情景，如低能见度（由于天气条件）下的决策，传统方法可能不足以胜任。我们通过准确性评估基于大型语言模型（LLMs）的这种能力。",
