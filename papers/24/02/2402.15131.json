    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了知识库问答（KBQA）的领域。KBQA被认为是一项具有挑战性的任务，特别是在将复杂问题解析为可执行逻辑形式方面。传统的基于语义解析（SP）的方法需要大量的数据注释，这导致了显著的成本。最近，由大型语言模型（LLM）推动的少样本上下文学习的出现展示了很好的能力。然而，在低资源情景下充分利用LLMs将问题解析为逻辑形式是一个重大挑战。为了应对这些障碍，我们引入了互动式知识库问答（Interactive-KBQA），这是一个旨在通过与知识库（KBs）直接互动来生成逻辑形式的框架。在这个框架内，我们开发了三个用于KB交互的通用API。对于每种复杂问题类别，我们设计了示例来指导LLMs完成推理过程。我们的方法取得了具有竞争力的结果。",
