    "translated_abstract": "异质信息网络（HIN）因能够捕捉不同类型节点之间复杂关系而日益受到青睐。元结构被提出用于识别HIN上的重要关系模式，已证明在提取丰富语义信息和促进图神经网络学习表达力表示方面有效。然而，手工设计的元结构在扩展性方面存在挑战，这引起了广泛关注，以发展自动元结构搜索算法。先前的研究集中于寻找具有良好经验预测性能的元结构，而忽视了可解释性。因此，他们往往产生易于过度拟合和人类难以理解的元结构。为了解决这个问题，我们从大型语言模型（LLM）新兴的推理能力中获取启示。我们提出了一种新颖的REasoning meta-STRUCTure search（ReStruct）框架",
