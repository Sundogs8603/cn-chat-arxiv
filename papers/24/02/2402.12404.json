This theme has raised various flags, showing concern for the future and seeking alternatives for a more sustainable life over the years. When studying greenhouse gas emissions, one of the main emitters of such gases is the burning of fuels, in which transport vehicles that depend on gas and oil are included. In this respect, air transport through aircraft is one of the sources emitting such gases. Aiming to reduce gas emissions, one of the ways to do this is by reducing fuel consumption; for this, aircraft would have to be more efficient, or the offer and demand for flights would be reduced. However, what if aircraft fuel consumption were taxed? What would be the effects of this on air transport? Could this be one of the alternatives to reduce emissions?

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，全球变暖和温室气体排放的议题越来越受到媒体关注。研究发现，其中一种主要的温室气体排放源是燃烧燃料，包括依赖燃气和石油的交通工具。在这方面，通过航空器进行航空运输是排放这类气体的来源之一。为了减少气体排放，减少燃油消耗是一个方法；为此，航空器必须更加高效，或者航班的供需将会减少。然而，如果对航空器的燃油消耗征税会发生什么？这对航空运输会有什么影响？这会成为减少排放的一种替代方法吗？为了理解征税和可能减少排放之间的关系",
