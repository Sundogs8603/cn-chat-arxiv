    "translated_abstract": "随着近年来对具有期望属性的分子进行数据驱动生成（也被称为逆向分子设计IMD）的显著关注，在精确度和解决方案多样性方面取得了重大进展。尽管现有的IMD方法在解决方面的准确性和多样性上取得了显著进展，但在可靠性方面仍然滞后。这些方法设计过程的根本问题是越来越隐含和间接，而且这一过程也与本机的前向过程（NFP）隔离，后者是模拟分子动力学的地面真实函数。基于这一思路，我们提出TrustMol，这是一种值得信赖的IMD方法。为此，TrustMol依赖于一组技术创新，包括一个新的变分自动编码器网络。此外，我们提出了一种潜在属性对获取方法，以有效地导航分子潜在优化的复杂性，这个过程看似直观但由于高频率.",
