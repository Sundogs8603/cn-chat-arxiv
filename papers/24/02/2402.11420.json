As a fundamental task in the NLP field, Chinese Grammatical Error Correction (CGEC) aims to correct all potential grammatical errors in the input sentences.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，研究人员广泛研究大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种下游NLP任务中的作用。作为NLP领域的一项基础任务，中文语法错误纠正（CGEC）旨在纠正输入句子中的所有潜在语法错误。先前的研究表明，由于其具有挑战性的任务重点，LLMs作为CGEC校正器的性能仍然令人不满。为了推动CGEC领域更好地适应LLMs时代，我们重新思考LLMs在CGEC任务中的作用，使其能够在CGEC中得到更好的利用和探索。考虑到LLMs中存储的丰富语法知识和其强大的语义理解能力，我们利用LLMs作为解释器，为CGEC小模型提供解释信息，以增强性能。我们还将LLMs用作评估器，带来更合理的CGEC评估，从而缓解由于",
