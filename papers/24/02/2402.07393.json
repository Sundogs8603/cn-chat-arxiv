    "translated_abstract": "由于光学的计算速度和效率优越，在资源受限的边缘平台上，基于电光计算系统为能效人工智能（AI）加速任务提供了巨大的潜力，特别是针对实时、低能量的深度神经网络（DNN）推理任务。然而，目前基于工厂可用设备和传统系统架构的光学神经加速器与高度定制的电子对应器相比，仍然存在性能差距。为了弥合由于领域专业化不足而导致的性能差距，我们提出了一种名为TeMPO的时分多路动态光学张量加速器，通过跨层设备/电路/架构定制实现。在设备级别上，我们呈现了工厂可用的、定制的光学器件，包括实验演示的慢光电光调制器、光分配器和相移器，显著减小了输入编码和点乘中的占地面积和功耗。",
