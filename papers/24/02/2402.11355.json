These methods are employed, for example, to eliminate or alter the encoding of demographic information such as gender within the model's representations, creating a counterfactual representation. However, since the intervention operates within the representation space, understanding precisely which features it modifies poses a challenge. We show that representation-space counterfactuals can be converted into natural language counterfactuals. We demonstrate that this approach enables us to analyze the linguistic alterations corresponding to a given representation-space intervention and to interpret the features utilized for encoding a specific concept. Moreover, the resulting counterfactuals can be used to mitigate bias in classification.",

    "translated_abstract": "针对语言模型（LMs）表征空间的干预方法已经被证明是影响模型行为的有效手段。这些方法被用来消除或改变模型表示中的人口统计信息（如性别）的编码，创建一个反事实的表示。然而，由于干预操作在表示空间内，准确理解它修改了哪些特征是一个挑战。我们展示了表征空间的反事实可以转化为自然语言的反事实。我们证明了这种方法使我们能够分析对应于给定表示空间干预的语言变化，并解释用于编码特定概念的特征。此外，由此产生的反事实可以用于减轻分类中的偏见。",
