    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑在线凸优化中的对抗性时变约束设置，其中的操作必须是相对于固定约束集可行的，并且还要平均地满足额外的时变约束。受到固定可行集（硬约束）在投影方面困难的情景的启发，我们考虑只通过线性优化预测（LOO）访问该集合的无投影算法。我们提出了一种算法，在长度为$T$的序列上，并使用总共$T$次LOO调用，保证与损失相关的$\\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$的遗憾和$O(T^{7/8})$的约束违反（忽略所有除$T$之外的量）。特别地，这些界限对于序列的任意区间都成立。我们还提出了一种更高效的算法，它只需要对软约束进行一阶预测访问，并实现了与整个序列相关的类似界限。",
