    "translated_abstract": "依赖于至少两个可控参数的开放量子系统中的共振可以显示出例外点（EP）现象，其中两个或多个共振的特征值和特征向量同时存在。在参数空间中准确定位这些点是具有挑战性的，特别是在计算量子谱和共振的数值计算非常昂贵的系统中。本文介绍了一种利用高斯过程回归（GPR）的高效机器学习算法来寻找例外点的方法。GPR模型基于一个初始的属于EP的特征值对进行训练，并通过数值较便宜的根搜索进行EP位置的初步估计。然后，通过将选择的确切特征值对添加为训练点来迭代改进估计。本文基于一个简单的低维矩阵模型开发和测试了GPR方法，然后将其应用于一个具有挑战性的真实物理系统，即定位EP。",
