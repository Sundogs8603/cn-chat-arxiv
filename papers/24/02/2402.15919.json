    "translated_abstract": "机器视觉容易受到激光遮蔽的影响，其中强烈的激光光可以通过过度饱和或对传感器像素造成永久性损坏来使其失明并扭曲其对环境的感知。本文利用波前编码的相位掩模来散射激光光的能量，并引入一种三明治生成对抗网络(SGAN)，用于从复杂的图像退化中恢复图像，例如不同的激光诱导的图像饱和度、掩模诱导的图像模糊、未知的光照条件和各种噪声污染。SGAN架构通过在一个可学习的图像反卷积模块周围封装两个GANs结合识别和生成方法。此外，我们利用傅里叶特征表示来减少神经网络的频谱偏差，并提高其对高频图像细节的学习。端到端训练包括基于现实物理学的综合，生成一系列公开可用的大规模训练数据。",
