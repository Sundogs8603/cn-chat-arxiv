However, its current evaluation strategies are notably impractical: they solely update with well-curated structured facts (triplets with subjects, relations, and objects), whereas real-world knowledge updates commonly emerge in unstructured texts like news articles. In this paper, we propose a new benchmark, Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE). It evaluates editing performance directly using unstructured texts as knowledge updates, termed unstructured facts. Hence UKE avoids the laborious construction of structured facts and enables efficient and responsive knowledge editing, becoming a more practical benchmark. We conduct extensive experiments on newly built datasets and demonstrate that UKE poses a significant challenge to state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods, resulting in their critical performance declines.

    "translated_abstract": "知识编辑旨在将知识更新注入语言模型中，使其保持正确性和最新性。然而，当前的评估策略明显不切实际：它们仅使用精心策划的结构化事实（主题、关系和对象的三元组）进行更新，而现实世界的知识更新通常出现在新闻文章等非结构化文本中。本文提出了一个新的基准，非结构化知识编辑（UKE）。它使用非结构化文本直接评估编辑性能，称为非结构化事实。因此，UKE避免了繁琐的结构化事实构建，实现了高效和响应迅速的知识编辑，成为一个更实用的基准。我们在新构建的数据集上进行了大量实验，并展示了UKE对最先进的知识编辑方法构成了重大挑战，导致它们的关键性能下降。",
