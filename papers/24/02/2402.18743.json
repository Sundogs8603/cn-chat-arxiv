This problem has multiple variables that must be optimized simultaneously, such as the makespan, the cost of the mission or the risk. Therefore, the problem has a lot of possible optimal solutions, and the operator must select the final solution to be executed among them. In order to reduce the workload of the operator in this decision process, a Decision Support System (DSS) becomes necessary.

    "translated_abstract": "在过去的十年里，由于其易管理性和风险规避能力，无人机在许多商业应用中被广泛使用。其中一个主要问题是多无人机的任务规划，需要找到一个满足问题不同约束条件的解决方案。本问题有多个同时需要优化的变量，如任务完成时间、任务成本或风险等。因此，问题有很多可能的最优解，操作员必须在其中选择要执行的最终解决方案。为了减少操作员在这个决策过程中的工作量，决策支持系统（DSS）变得必要。在这项工作中，设计了一个由排名和过滤系统组成的DSS，用于排序和减少最优解。就排名系统而言，涉及广泛的多准则决策方法",
