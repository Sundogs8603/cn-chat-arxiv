    "translated_abstract": "在神经科学中受到贝叶斯方法的启发，我们提出了一个简单的概率推断理论，用于推理和学习的统一理论。我们通过形式逻辑中的可满足性来建模数据如何导致符号知识。推理是通过抽象，即选择性无知，从数据中推导出符号知识的过程。我们讨论了逻辑推理关系的证明基础的理论正确性。我们还讨论了基于实验证据的MNIST数据集的实验正确性。",

The theory models how data lead to symbolic knowledge through abstraction and discusses the logical consequence relation and empirical correctness using the MNIST dataset."
