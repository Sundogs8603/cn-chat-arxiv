    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）生成高质量的文本和代码的能力使其越来越受欢迎。本文旨在通过将LLMs集成到STNWeb中，展示其在优化算法领域的潜力。STNWeb是一个用于生成搜索轨迹网络（STNs）的基于Web的工具，STNs是优化算法行为的可视化。虽然STNWeb生成的可视化结果对于算法设计者来说非常有信息量，但是往往需要一定的先验知识才能解释。为了弥补这种知识差距，我们将LLMs（特别是GPT-4）整合到STNWeb中，生成全面的书面报告，并自动生成图表，从而提升用户体验并减少研究界使用该工具的障碍。此外，我们的方法还可以扩展到优化社区中的其他工具，展示了其多功能性和潜力。",
