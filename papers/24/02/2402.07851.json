    "abstract": "In this draft we consider the problem of forecasting rainfall across India during the four monsoon months, one day as well as three days in advance. We train neural networks using historical daily gridded precipitation data for India obtained from IMD for the time period $1901- 2022$, at a spatial resolution of $1^{\\circ} \\times 1^{\\circ}$. This is compared with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecasts obtained from NCEP (National Centre for Environmental Prediction) available for the period 2011-2022. We conduct a detailed country wide analysis and separately analyze some of the most populated cities in India. Our conclusion is that forecasts obtained by applying deep learning to historical rainfall data are more accurate compared to NWP forecasts as well as predictions based on persistence. On average, compared to our predictions, forecasts from NCEP-NWP model have about 34% higher error for a single day prediction, and over 68% higher error for a three day prediction. Simila",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇文章中，我们考虑了在印度的四个季风月份，在一天和三天之前预测降雨的问题。我们使用来自IMD的印度历史日降水数据训练了神经网络，时间段为1901年至2022年，空间分辨率为1°×1°。这与来自NCEP（美国国家环境预报中心）的数值天气预报（NWP）预测进行了比较，该数据可用于2011年至2022年。我们进行了详细的全国范围分析，并分别分析了印度一些人口最多的城市。我们的结论是，将深度学习应用于历史降雨数据的预测比NWP预报和基于持续性的预测更准确。平均而言，与我们的预测相比，NCEP-NWP模型的预测在单日预测中的误差约高出34%，在三天预测中的误差高出68%以上。",
