Many educators have found that their take-home or remote tests and exams are vulnerable to ChatGPT-based cheating because students may directly use answers provided by tools like ChatGPT. In this paper, we try to provide an answer to an important question: how well ChatGPT can answer test questions and how we can detect whether the questions of a test can be answered correctly by ChatGPT. We generated ChatGPT's responses to the MedMCQA dataset, which contains over 10,000 medical school entrance exam questions. We analyzed the responses and uncovered certain types of questions ChatGPT answers more inaccurately than others. In addition, we have created a basic natural language processing model to single out the most vulnerable questions to ChatGPT in a collection of questions or a sample exam. Our tool can be us",

    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT是一种聊天机器人，可以相当准确地回答文本提示，甚至在研究生级别的问题上表现出色。许多教育工作者发现他们的课业或远程测试和考试容易受到基于ChatGPT的作弊的影响，因为学生可能直接使用ChatGPT等工具提供的答案。在本文中，我们试图回答一个重要问题：ChatGPT能多好回答测试题，以及我们如何检测测试题是否能被ChatGPT正确回答。我们生成了ChatGPT对MedMCQA数据集的响应，该数据集包含超过10,000个医学院入学考试问题。我们分析了这些回答，并揭示了ChatGPT在某些问题上的回答比其他问题更不准确。此外，我们创建了一个基本的自然语言处理模型，可以在一组问题或样本考试中筛选出对ChatGPT最易受攻击的问题。我们的工具可以被使用。",
