    "translated_abstract": "机器学习已经成为气候科学应用中普遍使用的工具。然而，目前的模型未能解决由人为改变温室气体排放引起的非平稳性，并且不会定期量化所提出的预测的不确定性。在本文中，我们对大西洋经向翻转环流（AMOC）进行建模，通过将温暖水输送到欧洲和美国东海岸，对这些地区的气候至关重要，并且有潜在的突然崩溃风险。我们可以生成通过任意时间尺度的任意极端气候场景，然后利用神经网络进行预测。我们的分析显示，在多样化的气候情景下，AMOC可以通过神经网络进行可预测。进一步的实验显示，MLP和深度集成可以学习AMOC的物理过程，而不是通过自相关模拟其进展。通过量化不确定性，发现了一个有趣的模式。",
