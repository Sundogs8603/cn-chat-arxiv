    "translated_abstract": "我们分析了混合补偿（MC）制度对专家医疗服务质量的影响。我们利用加拿大魁北克省在1999年实施的一项改革。政府引入了一种每日津贴与每次临床服务收费降低的支付机制。利用大型的患者/医生数据集，我们估计了一个类似区别于区别方法的多状态多次发生危险模型。我们从模型中计算出质量指标。我们的结果表明，这项改革降低了MC专家服务的质量，表现为出院后再住院风险和死亡率的增加。这些效应在不同的专业领域之间有所差异。",

The empirical analysis reveals that the reform resulted in a decrease in the quality of MC specialist services, evidenced by an increase in the risk of re-hospitalization and mortality after discharge."
