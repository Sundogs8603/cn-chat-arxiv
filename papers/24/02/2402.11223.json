    "translated_abstract": "从人类大脑出色的学习能力中汲取灵感，超高维度计算（HDC）作为一种新颖的计算范式出现，利用高维向量表示和操作进行类似大脑的轻量级机器学习（ML）。HDC的实际部署显著提高了学习效率，与当前的深度ML方法相比，在广泛的应用领域取得了显著进展。然而，提高HDC分类器在监督学习中的数据效率仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。在本文中，我们介绍了Hyperdimensional Efficient Active Learning（HEAL），这是一种专为HDC分类量身定制的新型主动学习（AL）框架。 HEAL通过不确定性和多样性引导的获取主动为未标记的数据点进行注释，从而实现更高效的数据集注释和降低劳动成本。与仅支持基于深度神经网络的分类器的传统AL方法不同，",
