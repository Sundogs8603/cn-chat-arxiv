    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型(LLMs)和基础模型被宣称为6G系统的改变者。然而，目前关于无线网络的LLMs的努力仅限于直接应用现有的为自然语言处理(NLP)应用设计的语言模型。为了解决这一挑战，并创建以无线为中心的基础模型，本文提出了一个全面的视野，介绍了如何设计针对部署人工智能(AI)原生网络的通用基础模型。与基于NLP的基础模型不同，所提出的框架通过三个关键能力促进了大型多模型(LMMs)的设计：1) 处理多模态感知数据，2) 通过因果推理和检索增强生成(RAG)将物理符号表示与现实世界的无线系统联系起来，3) 通过无线环境反馈实现可教导性，以促进动态网络配置。",
