First, we show that the model is remarkably universal, as it includes, but is not limited to, the celebrated Stein-Stein, Bergomi, and Heston models, together with some path-dependent variants. Second, we derive the joint characteristic functional of the log-price and integrated variance provided that some infinite dimensional extended tensor algebra valued Riccati equation admits a solution. This allows us to price and (quadratically) hedge certain European and path-dependent options using Fourier inversion techniques.

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一种随机波动性模型，其中波动性的动力学通过布朗运动时间推广签名的元素的可能无限线性组合给出。首先，我们展示了该模型的普适性，因为它包括但不限于著名的Stein-Stein、Bergomi和Heston模型，以及一些路径相关变体。然后，我们推导出对数价格和积分方差的联合特征函数，前提是某个无限维扩展张量代数值的Riccati方程有解。这使得我们能够使用Fourier反演技术定价和（二次）对冲某些欧式和路径相关期权。我们在全面的数值研究中突出了这些Fourier技术的效率和准确性。",
