    "translated_abstract": "深度生成模型(DGMs)在各个领域展示了巨大成功，特别是在使用从离线数据训练的模型生成文本、图像和视频方面。类似地，基于数据驱动的决策和机器人控制也需要从离线数据中学习一个生成函数作为策略或政策。在这种情况下，将深度生成模型应用于离线策略学习展现出巨大潜力，许多研究在这个方向上进行了探索。然而，这一领域仍然缺乏全面的评估，因此不同分支的发展相对独立。因此，我们提供了深度生成模型在离线策略学习应用方面的第一次系统性综述。具体而言，我们涵盖了五种主流深度生成模型，包括变分自动编码器、生成对抗网络、归一化流、变压器和扩散模型，以及它们的应用。",
