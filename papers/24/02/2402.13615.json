In this article, we take a rather uncommon perspective on this phenomenon. Instead of trying to explain the nature or causes of the conjunction fallacy (intensional definition), we analyze its range of factual possibilities (extensional definition). We show that the majority of research on the conjunction fallacy, according to our sample of experiments reviewed which covers literature between 1983 and 2016, has focused on a narrow part of the a priori factual possibilities, implying that explanations of the conjunction fallacy are fundamentally biased by the short scope of possibilities explored. The latter is a rather curious aspect of the research evolution in the conjunction fallacy considering that the very nature of it is motivated by extension",

    "translated_abstract": "自从Tversky和Kahneman的开创性论文以来，连词谬误一直是多次辩论的主题，并成为决策制定中认知理论面临的基本挑战。本文从一种不太常见的角度来看待这一现象。我们分析其事实可能性的范围，而不是试图解释连词谬误的本质或原因（内涵定义）。我们展示了根据我们所审查的涵盖了1983年至2016年文献的实验样本，大多数关于连词谬误的研究集中在先验事实可能性的狭窄部分，暗示了连词谬误的解释在很大程度上受限于探索的可能性范围狭隘。后者是连词谬误研究进化中相当奇特的一个方面，考虑到它本质上是由其可能性的扩展所推动的。",
