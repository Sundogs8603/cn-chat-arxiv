Despite their importance, MPMOPs remain understudied in comparison to conventional multiobjective optimization. The competition aims to address this gap by encouraging researchers to explore tailored modeling approaches. The test suite comprises two parts: problems with common Pareto optimal solutions and Biparty Multiobjective UAV Path Planning (BPMO-UAVPP) problems with unknown solutions. Optimization algorithms for the first part are evaluated using Multiparty Inverted Generational Distance (MPIGD), and the second part is evaluated using Multiparty Hypervolume (MPHV) metrics. The average algorithm ranking across all problems serves as a performance benchmark.",

    "translated_abstract": "该竞赛关注多方多目标优化问题（MPMOPs），其中多个决策者具有冲突的目标，如无人机路径规划应用中所见。尽管其重要性，与传统多目标优化相比，MPMOPs仍然研究不足。该竞赛旨在通过鼓励研究人员探索定制建模方法来填补这一空白。测试套件分为两部分：具有共同帕累托最优解的问题和具有未知解的双方多目标无人机路径规划（BPMO-UAVPP）问题。第一部分的优化算法使用多方倒转式生成距离（MPIGD）进行评估，第二部分使用多方超体积（MPHV）指标进行评估。跨所有问题的平均算法排名用作性能基准。",
