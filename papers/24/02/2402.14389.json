    "translated_abstract": "金融机构和企业面临着来自欺诈交易的持续挑战，促使需要有效的检测方法。检测信用卡欺诈对于识别和阻止未经授权的交易至关重要。及时发现欺诈可使调查人员迅速采取行动，以减少进一步损失。然而，调查过程通常耗时，限制了每天可以彻底检查的警报数量。因此，欺诈检测模型的主要目标是提供准确的警报，同时尽量减少误报和漏报的欺诈案例。在本文中，我们引入了一种最先进的混合集成(ENS)可靠机器学习(ML)模型，通过使用网格搜索智能地结合多个算法并进行适当加权优化，包括决策树(DT)、随机森林(RF)、K-最近邻(KNN)和多层感知机(MLP)，以增强欺诈检测。",
