While recommender systems have been designed to improve the user experience in dating platforms by providing personalized recommendations, increasing concerns about fairness have encouraged the development of fairness-aware recommender systems from various perspectives (e.g., gender and race). However, sexual orientation, which plays a significant role in finding a satisfying relationship, is under-investigated. To fill this crucial gap, we propose a novel metric, Opposite Gender Interaction Ratio (OGIR), as a way to investigate potential unfairness for users with varying preferences towards the opposite gender. We empirically analyze a real online dating dataset and observe existing recommender algorithms could suffer from group unfairness according to OGIR. We further investigate the potential causes for such g",

    "translated_abstract": "在线约会平台作为个人寻找潜在恋爱关系的手段已经广受欢迎。尽管推荐系统旨在通过提供个性化推荐来改善约会平台的用户体验，但关于公平性的增加关注促使从各种角度（例如性别和种族）开发考虑公平性的推荐系统。然而，对于找到令人满意的关系起着重要作用的性取向却受到了较少的研究。为了填补这一重要空白，我们提出了一种新颖的度量标准，即相反性别互动比（OGIR），作为研究具有不同对异性偏好的用户潜在不公平性的方式。我们在一个真实的在线约会数据集上进行了实证分析，并观察到现有的推荐算法根据OGIR可能会受到分组不公平的影响。我们进一步调查了造成这种不公平的潜在原因。",
