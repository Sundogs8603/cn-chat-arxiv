    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新的算法，用于从包含有关音符边界的MIDI文件中联合估计音高符号和调性猜测的问题。我们的算法不仅可以识别全局调性，还可以在整个分析乐曲中识别局部调性。它使用动态规划技术来搜索在印刷谱表中将显示的意外符号数量方面的最佳符号。对该数量的评估与全局调性以及一些局部调性的估计相结合，每个小节都有一个局部调性。这三种信息中的每一种都用于估计其他信息，在一个多步骤的过程中。对包含总共216464个音符的单音和钢琴数据集进行的评估显示，无论是音高符号（在巴赫作品集中平均为99.5%，在整个数据集上为98.2%）还是全局调性符号估计（平均为93.0%）",
