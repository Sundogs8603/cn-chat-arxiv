    "abstract": "The advent of generative artificial intelligence and the widespread adoption of it in society engendered intensive debates about its ethical implications and risks. These risks often differ from those associated with traditional discriminative machine learning. To synthesize the recent discourse and map its normative concepts, we conducted a scoping review on the ethics of generative artificial intelligence, including especially large language models and text-to-image models. Our analysis provides a taxonomy of 378 normative issues in 19 topic areas and ranks them according to their prevalence in the literature. The study offers a comprehensive overview for scholars, practitioners, or policymakers, condensing the ethical debates surrounding fairness, safety, harmful content, hallucinations, privacy, interaction risks, security, alignment, societal impacts, and others. We discuss the results, evaluate imbalances in the literature, and explore unsubstantiated risk scenarios.",

    "translated_abstract": "生成型人工智能的出现和它在社会中的广泛应用引发了关于其伦理影响和风险的激烈辩论。这些风险往往与传统的判别式机器学习所带来的风险有所不同。为了综合近期的讨论并映射其规范概念，我们对生成型人工智能的伦理问题进行了一项范围调查，特别关注大型语言模型和文本到图像模型。我们的分析提供了一个对19个主题领域中378个规范问题进行分类的分类法，并按照它们在文献中的普遍性进行了排序。这项研究为学者、实践者或决策制定者提供了一个全面的概述，压缩了围绕公正性、安全性、有害内容、幻觉、隐私、互动风险、安全性、一致性、社会影响等伦理争议。我们讨论了结果，评估了文献中的不平衡情况，并探索了未经证实的风险场景。",
