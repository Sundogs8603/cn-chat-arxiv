    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了通过自适应地引发配对比较来可能近似正确且公平（PACF）对项目进行排序的问题。给定一个属于不相交群组的$n$个项目集，我们的目标是根据我们提出的公平目标函数找到一个$(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-PACF-Ranking。我们假设可以访问一个Oracle，对于每个查询，学习者可以选择一对项目，并从Oracle接收到随机的获胜者反馈。我们提出的目标函数要求最小化群组误差的$\\ell_q$范数，其中群组误差是该群组中所有项目误差的$\\ell_p$范数，对于$p, q \\geq 1$。这扩展了Saha＆Gopalan（2019）提出的$\\epsilon$-Best-Ranking目标函数。通过采用我们的目标函数，我们获得了探索平等或比例误差等基本公平概念的灵活性。调整参数$p$和$q$可以按需定制。",
