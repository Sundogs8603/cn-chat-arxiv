    "translated_abstract": "生成流网络（GFlowNets）是一类概率生成模型，用于学习按照奖励比例对组合对象进行采样。GFlowNets的一个重大挑战是在处理长时间跨度和稀疏奖励时有效训练它们。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了进化引导的生成流网络（EGFN），这是对GFlowNets训练的一种简单但强大的增强方法，使用进化算法（EA）进行训练。我们的方法可以在任何GFlowNets训练目标的基础上工作，通过使用EA训练一组代理参数，将结果轨迹存储在优先回放缓冲区中，并使用存储的轨迹训练GFlowNets代理。我们在广泛的玩具和真实世界基准任务上进行了深入研究，展示了我们方法在处理长轨迹和稀疏奖励方面的有效性。",
