    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种显著减轻连续学习中的灾难性遗忘的新视角，强调模型保持现有知识并融入新信息的能力。目前的重播方法同等对待每个任务和数据样本，因此无法充分利用重播缓冲区的潜力。作为回应，我们提出了COgnitive REplay（CORE），它从人类认知复习过程中得到灵感。CORE包括两个关键策略：自适应数量分配和以质量为重点的数据选择。前者根据每个任务的遗忘速率自适应地调节回放缓冲区的分配，而后者保证在缓冲区中包含最能概括每个任务特征的代表性数据。我们的方法在分割CIFAR10上实现了37.95%的平均准确率，超过最佳基准方法6.52%。此外，它还显著提高了最差表现模型的准确率。",
