    "translated_abstract": "鲁棒性往往牺牲了准确性，阻碍了鲁棒分类模型在实际应用中的使用。基于训练的解决方案在与已训练的大型高性能模型兼容性方面存在限制，因此需要探索无需训练的集成方法。我们观察到鲁棒模型在干净数据和对抗数据上的正确预测比错误预测更自信，我们推测通过增强这种“良性置信度特性”可以在集成环境中实现准确性和鲁棒性的平衡。为了实现这一点，我们提出了“MixedNUTS”，一种无需训练的方法，利用仅有三个参数的非线性转换来处理鲁棒分类器和标准非鲁棒分类器的输出Logits，并通过高效算法进行优化。然后，MixedNUTS将转换后的Logits转换为概率，并将它们混合作为最终的输出。在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上进行了实验。",
