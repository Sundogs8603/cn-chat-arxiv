We devise tools for visualizing the diffusion process and answering the aforementioned research questions to render the diffusion process human-understandable.

    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型在生成任务中表现出色，然而解释扩散过程仍具挑战性，因为它是一系列难以解释的去噪图像序列。为了解决这一问题，我们从模型生成的视觉概念和模型在每个时间步骤关注的区域的角度提出了三个研究问题来解释扩散过程。我们设计了可视化扩散过程和回答上述研究问题的工具，使扩散过程易于人理解。通过利用工具进行各种视觉分析实验的结果，解释了扩散过程中输出是如何逐渐生成的，强调了每个时间步骤的去噪程度，并突出显示了与基础视觉概念的关系。",
