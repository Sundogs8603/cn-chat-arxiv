    "translated_abstract": "开放式检索对话式问答（OrConvQA）在给定对话和文档集合的情况下回答问题。典型的OrConvQA流程包括三个模块：一个检索器用于从集合中检索相关文档，一个重新排序器根据问题和上下文对它们重新排序，并且一个阅读器用于提取答案范围。对话的转向可以为回答最终问题提供有价值的上下文。目前最先进的OrConvQA系统在流程的三个模块中使用相同的历史建模。我们假设这是次优的。具体而言，我们认为第一个模块中需要更广泛的上下文以防止错过相关文档，而最后一个模块中需要更狭窄的上下文来确定精确的答案范围。我们提出NORMY，第一个无监督的非均匀历史建模流程，为每个模块生成最佳对话历史。我们进一步提出了一种新颖的NORMY检索器，它使用k",
