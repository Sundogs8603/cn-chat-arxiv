    "translated_abstract": "对话式搜索利用多轮自然语言环境来检索相关段落。现有的对话密集检索模型大多将对话视为一系列固定的问题和回答，忽视了严重的数据稀疏性问题 - 也就是说，用户可以以不同的方式进行对话，而这些备选对话是未记录的。因此，它们经常难以推广到真实场景中的多样对话。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种通过LLM-认知数据增强广义对话密集检索的框架(ConvAug)。ConvAug首先生成多级增强对话，以捕捉对话环境的多样性。受人类认知方式的启发，我们设计了一种认知感知过程，以减少错误的正例、负例和幻觉的生成。此外，我们还开发了一种难度自适应样本筛选器，用于选择复杂对话的具有挑战性的样本。",

The method generates multi-level augmented conversations to capture the diverse nature of conversational contexts. It also addresses the issue of false positives, false negatives, and hallucinations through a cognition-aware process. Additionally, it introduces a difficulty-adaptive sample filter to select challenging samples for complex conversations."
