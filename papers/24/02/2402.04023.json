Two datasets comprising MHealth information from the UK National Health Service website and information leaflets from The Royal College of Psychiatrists were used. Native speakers of the target languages manually assessed the GT translations, focusing on medical terminology accuracy, comprehensibility, and critical syntactic/semantic errors. GT output analysis revealed challenges in accurately translating medical terminology, particularly in Arabic, Romanian, and Persian. Fluency issues were prevalent across various languages, affecting comprehension, mainly in Arabic and Spanish. Critical errors arose in specific contexts, such as bullet-point formatting, speci",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了谷歌翻译在心理健康信息翻译中的应用，并通过分析从英语到波斯语、阿拉伯语、土耳其语、罗马尼亚语和西班牙语的心理健康领域的谷歌翻译输出来评估其准确性、可理解性和对多语言医疗沟通的影响。使用了两个数据集，包括英国国家卫生服务网站上的心理健康信息和英国皇家精神病学学院的信息传单。目标语言的母语人士手动评估了谷歌翻译的翻译结果，重点关注医学术语的准确性、可理解性和关键的句法/语义错误。谷歌翻译的输出分析揭示了在准确翻译医学术语方面所面临的挑战，特别是在阿拉伯语、罗马尼亚语和波斯语方面。在各种语言中普遍存在流畅性问题，主要影响了阿拉伯语和西班牙语的理解。在特定语境中出现了关键错误，比如项目符号格式等。",
