    "abstract": "In this work, a sentiment analysis method that is capable of accepting audio of any length, without being fixed a priori, is proposed. Mel spectrogram and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients are used as audio description methods and a Fully Convolutional Neural Network architecture is proposed as a classifier. The results have been validated using three well known datasets: EMODB, RAVDESS, and TESS. The results obtained were promising, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. Also, thanks to the fact that the proposed method admits audios of any size, it allows a sentiment analysis to be made in near real time, which is very interesting for a wide range of fields such as call centers, medical consultations, or financial brokers.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种能够接受任意长度音频的情感分析方法，不需要事先固定长度。该方法使用Mel频谱图和Mel频率倒谱系数作为音频描述方法，并提出了一种全卷积神经网络架构作为分类器。通过使用EMODB、RAVDESS和TESS三个知名数据集进行验证，结果表明该方法的表现优于现有最先进方法。此外，由于该方法可以接受任意大小的音频，因此可以实时进行情感分析，这对于呼叫中心、医疗咨询或金融经纪等多个领域非常有意义。",
