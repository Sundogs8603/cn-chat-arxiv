    "translated_abstract": "语义理解在稠密同时定位和建图（SLAM）中起着关键作用，有助于全面的场景解析。最近将高斯点云集成到SLAM系统中的进展表明，通过使用显式的三维高斯表示，可以生成高质量的渲染效果。基于这一进展，我们提出了SGS-SLAM，这是第一个基于三维高斯点云的语义稠密视觉SLAM系统，它不仅提供精确的三维语义分割，还实现了高保真度的重建。具体而言，我们提出在建图过程中采用多通道优化，将外观、几何和语义约束与关键帧优化相结合，以提高重建质量。大量实验证明SGS-SLAM在相机位姿估计、地图重建和语义分割方面表现出了最先进的性能，优于现有方法同时保持实时渲染。",
