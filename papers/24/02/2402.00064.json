    "translated_abstract": "管理过渡计划是认知障碍人士面临的主要问题之一。因此，找到一种自动化生成这种计划的方法将是对这个群体有益的工具。在本文中，我们特别提出并比较了不同的替代方式，通过合并由多个操作代理执行的目标和动作之间的未知相似性序列形成的计划，这些代理之间进行合作，对一些 passsive 元素（节点代理）应用这些行动，在使用一段时间后需要执行另一个计划。这种对计划动作和目标相似性的无知可以解释为使用分布式推荐系统，该系统会根据其他操作代理以前执行不同计划的已知结果，为特定目标的给定操作代理提供一个有用的计划。在这里，我们提供了执行的总体框架（代理系统）以及不同的合并算法。",
