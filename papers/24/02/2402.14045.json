    "translated_abstract": "医学成像数据集的大容量和复杂性是存储、传输和处理的瓶颈。为解决这些挑战，低秩矩阵逼近（LRMA）及其派生物局部LRMA（LLRMA）的应用已显示出潜力。本文进行了系统文献综述，展示了在医学成像中应用LRMA和LLRMA的作品。文献的详细分析确认了应用于各种成像模态的LRMA和LLRMA方法。本文解决了现有LRMA和LLRMA方法所面临的挑战和限制。我们注意到，自2015年以来，医学成像领域明显偏向于LLRMA，显示了相对于LRMA在捕获医学数据中复杂结构方面的潜力和有效性。鉴于LLRMA所使用的浅层相似性方法的限制，我们建议使用先进语义图像分割来处理相似性。",
