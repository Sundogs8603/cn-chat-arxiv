    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习研究中，寻找一个能够在多个领域无缝运作的通用模型仍然是一个重要目标。在强化学习领域中，主流的方法往往将模型限制在单一任务和单模态框架中，这一限制与通用的、多领域模型的广阔愿景相矛盾。本文提出了Jack of All Trades (JAT) 一个基于Transformer的模型，其独特设计优化了处理顺序决策任务和多模态数据类型的能力。JAT模型通过使用一个权重集，在非常不同的强化学习基准测试上展现了其强大的性能和多样性，同时在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务上展示了有希望的结果。JAT模型是朝着更通用、跨领域的AI模型设计迈出的重要一步，并且值得注意的是，它是首个完全开放的这一类型的模型。",
