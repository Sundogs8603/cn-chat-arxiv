    "translated_abstract": "一个议程设定者反复向选民提出空间政策，直到某个提议被接受。选民具有不同但相关的偏好，并接收有关共同状态的私人信号。本文研究了在玩家变得完全耐心且私人信号变得完全精确时，议程设定者是否保留了筛选选民的能力。我表明，这种能力的程度取决于私人信号相对精度和选民之间的偏好冲突，证实了委员会设置和单峰偏好的关键作用。当私人信号具有相等的精度时，议程设定者可以实现完全信息的基准。当一个选民接收到一个渐进性更精确的信号时，议程设定者的筛选能力取决于偏好多样性。这些结果意味着没有对单个提议的承诺可能有利于议程设定者。令人惊讶的是，投票门槛的提高可以使议程设定者得到更多的好处。",

Furthermore, increasing the voting threshold can benefit the agenda-setter."
