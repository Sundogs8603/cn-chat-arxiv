    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于大型语言模型的自主系统(LLMAS)因其模拟人类社会复杂行为的潜力而广受关注。其中一个主要挑战是如何展示和分析LLMAS的动态事件演变。在本研究中，我们提出了一种可视化方法，用于探索LLMAS中的详细状态和代理行为。我们提出了一个通用的流程，从原始LLMAS执行事件中建立行为结构，利用行为总结算法构建整个结构的时间序列层次摘要，并使用因果关系追踪方法挖掘代理行为之间的因果关系。然后，我们开发了一个名为AgentLens的可视化分析系统，通过使用分层时间可视化来展示LLMAS的演变，并支持用户交互式地研究代理行为的详细信息和原因。包括两个使用场景和一个用户 摘要。",
