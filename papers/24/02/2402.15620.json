    "translated_abstract": "中国和日本之间的经济结构比较长期以来一直吸引着发展经济学家的关注。为了更深入地研究两国从1995年到2018年的部门差异，我们使用了两国年度投入产出表(IOTs)来构建加权和定向的投入产出网络(IONs)。这有助于进行更深入的网络分析。强度分布突显了部门间经济互动的差异。加权、定向的同配系数概括了相连部门特征之间的同质性。通过调整PageRank中心性的重点，确定了关键部门。社区检测揭示了它们在部门之间的聚类倾向。如预期的那样，分析指出了制造业是中国的中心部门，而日本更青睐服务业。然而，在更具体的部门层面上，两国都呈现出不同的结构演变。在中国和日本的部门社区方面，存在着不同的情况。",
