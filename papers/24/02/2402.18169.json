However, understanding the intention behind social media posts remains challenging due to the implicitness of intentions in social media posts, the need for cross-modality understanding of both text and images, and the presence of noisy information such as hashtags, misspelled words, and complicated abbreviations. To address these challenges, we present MIKO, a Multimodal Intention Kowledge DistillatiOn framework that collaboratively leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) and a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to uncover users' intentions. Specifically, we use an MLLM to interpret the image and an LLM to extract key information from the text and finally instruct the LLM again to generate intentions.

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体已经成为与他人联系、了解新闻、表达观点以及找到娱乐的无处不在的工具。然而，由于社交媒体帖子中意图的隐含性、需要跨模态理解文本和图像、以及存在标签、拼写错误和复杂缩写等嘈杂信息，理解社交媒体帖子背后的意图仍然具有挑战性。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了MIKO，一个多模态意图知识蒸馏框架，它共同利用大型语言模型（LLM）和多模态大型语言模型（MLLM）来揭示用户的意图。具体来说，我们使用MLLM来解释图像，并使用LLM从文本中提取关键信息，最后再次指导LLM生成意图。通过将MIKO应用于公开可用的社交媒体数据集，我们构建了一个意图知识",
