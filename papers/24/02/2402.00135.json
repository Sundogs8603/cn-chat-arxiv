In this work, we use deep reinforcement learning to develop a locomotion controller that minimizes ground reaction forces (GRF) on crutches. The rationale for minimizing GRF is to reduce the upper body effort of the user. Accordingly, we design a model and a learning framework for a human-exoskeleton system with crutches. We formulate a reward function to encourage the forward displacement of a human-exoskeleton system while satisfying the predetermined constraints of a physical robot.

    "translated_abstract": "身体各部分的力量主要来自上半身的努力，而下半身被认为是被动的。然而，在设计运动控制器时，文献中往往忽视了使用者上半身的努力。本研究使用深度强化学习开发一种运动控制器，其目标是最小化拐杖上的地面反作用力，以减轻使用者的上半身努力。我们设计了一个人体-外骨骼系统的模型和学习框架，并制定了一种奖励函数，以鼓励人体-外骨骼系统的前向位移并满足物理机器人的预定约束。我们使用MuJoCo物理模拟器和多个实验进行了Proximal Policy Optimization，即最先进的深度强化学习方法的新框架的评估。",
