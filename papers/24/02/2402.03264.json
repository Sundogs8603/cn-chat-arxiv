    "translated_abstract": "生成模型在捕捉人类移动特征和生成合成轨迹方面取得了很好的效果。然而，确保生成的地理空间移动数据在语义上是真实的，包括一致的位置序列以及反映现实世界的特征，如对地理限制的约束，仍然具有挑战性。为了解决这些问题，我们将人类移动建模重新构建为一个自回归生成任务，利用了Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)。为了确保其可控的生成来缓解上述挑战，我们提出了一种地理感知的生成模型，即MobilityGPT。我们通过引入基于重力的采样方法训练了一个用于语义序列相似性的transformer。然后，通过使用一个道路连接矩阵对训练过程进行约束，该矩阵给出了轨迹生成中序列之间的连接性，从而保持生成的轨迹在地理范围内。最后，我们构建了一个强化学习引导的改进目标函数来增强模型的生成性能。",
