We develop a novel reinforcement learning-based covert routing algorithm that finds a route from the source to the destination where each node identifies its next hop and modality only based on the local feedback information received from its neighboring nodes. We show based on numerical simulations that the proposed covert routing strategy has only negligible performance loss compared to the optimal centralized routing scheme.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在异构网络中进行隐秘路由通信，其中源节点通过中继节点将机密数据传输到目标节点，每个传输节点都会明智地在多个通信模式中选择一种模式。我们开发了一种基于强化学习的新型隐秘路由算法，该算法仅根据从其相邻节点接收到的本地反馈信息，使每个节点确定其下一个跳和模式。通过数值模拟，我们展示了所提出的隐秘路由策略与最优集中式路由方案相比仅有可忽略的性能损耗。",
