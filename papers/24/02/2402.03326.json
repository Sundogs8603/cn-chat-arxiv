    "translated_abstract": "感知和推理个体对象及其相互作用的能力是构建智能人工系统的目标。现有的方法使用前馈编码器来提取对象嵌入，使用潜在图神经网络来建模这些对象嵌入之间的相互作用。然而，前馈编码器无法提取“对象为中心”的表示，也无法区分外观相似的多个对象。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了一种称为“Slot结构化世界模型”（SSWM）的世界模型类，它将基于Slot注意力的“对象为中心”编码器与基于潜在图的动力学模型相结合。我们在Spriteworld基准测试中评估了我们的方法，该测试使用简单的物理相互作用规则，在操作条件下评估了一系列（多步）预测任务中的预测性能。所有复现论文实验的代码都可获取。",
