    "translated_abstract": "基于云的大型语言模型（LLM）如ChatGPT在日常操作中变得越来越重要，成为各种应用程序中的重要工具。虽然这些模型在可访问性和功能性方面带来了重大好处，但它们也引入了重要的隐私问题：在云基础架构中传输和存储用户数据会产生重大的数据泄露和未经授权访问敏感信息的风险；即使数据的传输和存储被加密，LLM服务提供商仍然知道数据的真实内容，从而阻止个人或实体放心使用此类LLM服务。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种简单但有效的机制PromptCrypt来保护用户隐私。它使用表情符号对用户输入进行加密，然后将其发送到LLM，有效地使其对人类或LLM的检查无法理解，同时保留原始提示的意图，从而确保用户隐私。",
