This process is time-consuming, and causes ED crowding which significantly impacts patient mortality, medical errors, staff burnout, etc. This work proposes (time) cost-effective diagnostic assistance that explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in assisting ED clinicians to make time-efficient and accurate diagnoses. Using publicly available patient data, we collaborate with ED clinicians to curate MIMIC-ED-Assist, a benchmark that measures the ability of AI systems in suggesting laboratory tests that minimize ED wait times, while correctly predicting critical outcomes such as death. We develop ED-Copilot which sequentially suggests patient-specific laboratory tests and makes diagnostic predictions. ED-Copilot uses a pre-trained bio-medical language model to encode patient information and reinforcement learn",

    "translated_abstract": "在急诊科（ED）中，患者在诊断前需要进行分诊和多种实验室检测。这个过程耗时，导致急诊科拥挤，显著影响患者死亡率、医疗错误、人员枯竭等。本研究提出了一种（时间）成本有效的诊断辅助方法，探索人工智能系统在协助急诊科临床医生进行高效准确诊断方面的潜力。使用公开可获得的患者数据，我们与急诊科临床医生合作策划了MIMIC-ED-Assist，这是一个衡量人工智能系统在建议最大程度减少急诊等待时间的实验室检测，并在正确预测诸如死亡之类关键结果方面的能力的基准。我们开发了ED-Copilot，它依次建议患者特定的实验室检测并进行诊断预测。ED-Copilot使用预训练的生物医学语言模型对患者信息进行编码并进行增强学习。",
