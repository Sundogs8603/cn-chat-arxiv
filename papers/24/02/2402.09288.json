    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习工作流中量化数据的价值可以在机器学习倡议中做出更具战略意义的决策中起到关键作用。现有的基于Shapley值的机器学习数据估值框架在计算方面非常昂贵，因为需要大量重复训练模型才能获得Shapley值。在本文中，我们介绍了一种高效的数据估值框架EcoVal，以快速实用的方式估算机器学习模型数据的价值。我们不直接处理独立的数据样本，而是确定类似的数据点簇的价值。这个价值进一步在所有成员簇点之间传播。我们展示了可以通过估计每个数据的内在和外在价值来确定整体数据价值。这是通过将模型的性能建模为“生产函数”来实现的，这是一个非常重要的概念。",
