Additionally, due to the context size limitation of many transformer-based LLMs, it is often not reasonable to expect that the full structured and unstructured context will fit into a given prompt in a zero-shot setting, let alone a few-shot setting. We introduce BlendSQL, a superset of SQLite to act as a unified dialect for orchestrating reasoning across both unstructured and structured data. For hybrid question answering tasks involving multi-hop reasoning, we encode the full decomposed reasoning roadmap into a single interpretable BlendSQL query. Notably, we show that BlendSQL can scale to massive datasets and improve the performance of end-to-end systems while using 35% fewer tokens. Our code",

    "translated_abstract": "许多现有端到端系统用于混合问题回答任务，往往可以归结为“提示-祈祷”范式，用户对中间推理步骤的控制和洞察受限。此外，由于许多基于Transformer的LLM模型的上下文大小限制，往往不合理期望完整的结构化和非结构化上下文适合于给定提示在零次示范环境中，更不用说几次提示环境中。我们介绍了BlendSQL，它是SQLite的一个超集，用作统一的方言，用于在非结构化和结构化数据之间编排推理。对于涉及多跳推理的混合问题回答任务，我们将完整的分解推理路线图编码为一个可解释的BlendSQL查询。值得注意的是，我们展示了BlendSQL可以扩展到大规模数据集，并在使用35%更少令牌的情况下改善端到端系统的性能。",
