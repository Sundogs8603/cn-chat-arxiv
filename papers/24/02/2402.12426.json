    "translated_abstract": "图经常用来模型化现代社交媒体和文献应用中的复杂网络。我们的研究通过基于特征的对抗攻击，重点关注决策时攻击和毒化攻击，探究这些图的脆弱性。与Net Attack和Meta Attack等最先进模型针对节点属性和图结构不同，我们的研究专门针对节点属性。我们利用Hellaswag文本数据集以及图数据集Cora和CiteSeer进行分析，为评估提供了多样的基础。我们的发现表明，使用Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)的决策时攻击比采用Mean Node Embeddings和Graph Contrastive Learning策略的毒化攻击更具威力。这为图数据安全提供了见解，指出了图基模型最脆弱的地方，从而为开发工作提供信息。",
