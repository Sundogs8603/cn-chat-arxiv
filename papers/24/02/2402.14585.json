    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在赌徒反馈下利用专家建议进行预测的经典问题。我们的模型假设一种行动，即学习者放弃参与游戏，在每次试验中都没有奖励或损失。我们提出了CBA算法，利用这一假设获得了可以显著改进经典Exp4算法的奖励界限。我们可以将我们的问题视为在学习者有放弃参与游戏选项时对置信评级预测器进行聚合。重要的是，我们是第一个对一般置信评级预测器的预期累积奖励实现界限的研究者。在专家案例中，我们实现了一种新颖的奖励界限，显著改进了之前在专家Exp（将弃权视为另一种行动）的边界。作为一个示例应用，我们讨论了在有限度量空间中学习球的并集。在这个上下文设置中，我们设计了CBA的有效实现，re",
