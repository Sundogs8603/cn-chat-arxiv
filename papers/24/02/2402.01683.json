    "translated_abstract": "2023年6月，由加拿大野火飘入纽约市的烟雾使得该市空气污染达到全球最严重水平。这种前所未有的情况导致纽约市居民的出行和传统活动模式发生了重大变化。本研究利用大规模社交媒体数据研究了2023年加拿大野火烟雾在纽约市出现时的不同危机活动关注（包括疏散、呆在室内、购物和娱乐活动等）。为此，我们收集了纽约市一个星期（2023年6月2日至6月9日）的地理标记的Twitter数据，并使用先进的文本分类技术对这些推文进行了处理，然后将其与社保局数据、人口普查和美国社区调查等国家数据库进行了整合。最后，我们开发了一个模型来对重大野火中不同活动关注进行社区推断。研究结果表明，在野火期间，纽约市居民的活动关注发生了变化。",
