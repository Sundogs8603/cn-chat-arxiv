    "translated_abstract": "制药行业的合规性要求需要面对复杂且大量的指南文件，通常需要大量人力资源。为了解决这些挑战，我们的研究引入了一种利用生成式AI和检索增强生成（RAG）方法的聊天机器人模型。该聊天机器人旨在搜索与用户查询相关的指南文件，并根据检索到的指南提供答案。考虑到这个领域对高可靠性的需求，我们提出了问题回答检索增强生成（QA-RAG）模型。在对比实验中，QA-RAG模型在准确性上显示出显著改进，优于包括传统RAG方法在内的所有其他基线模型。本文详细介绍了QA-RAG的结构和性能评估，并强调其在药品监管合规领域及其他领域的潜力。我们已将我们的工作公开提供给进一步研究。",
