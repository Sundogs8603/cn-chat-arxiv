    "translated_abstract": "自然语言理解的一个挑战是处理句子的主观性，这些句子可能表达意见和情感，增加了复杂性和细微差别。情感分析是一个旨在从文本中提取和分析这些主观元素的领域，可以应用在不同的粒度级别，如文档、段落、句子或方面。面向方面的情感分析是一个经过研究的课题，有很多可用的数据集和模型。然而，对于面向方面的情感分析来说，什么因素使一个句子变得困难并没有清晰的定义。在本文中，我们通过对三个数据集：“笔记本电脑”、“餐馆”和“MTSC”（多目标依赖情感分类）以及这三个数据集的合并版本进行实验，探讨了这个问题。我们研究了领域多样性和句法多样性对困难度的影响。我们使用一组分类器来识别最困难的句子并分析它们的特征。",
