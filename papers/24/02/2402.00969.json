There has been a lot of effort oriented to solve this task using natural language processing tools and creativity encouragement by way of many challenges. Our approach focuses on assuming a correct entity linking on the natural language questions and training a GPT model to create SPARQL queries from them. We managed to isolate which property of the task can be the most difficult to solve at few or zero-shot and we proposed pre-training on all entities (under CWA) to improve the performance. We obtained a 62.703% accuracy of exact SPARQL matches on testing at 3-shots, a F1 of 0.809 on the entity linking challenge and a F1 of 0.009 on the question answering challenge.",

    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱的流行度在过去几年中迅速增长。人们可以通过互联网上的许多在线数据库查询这些知识。但是，如果非程序员用户能够访问他们想要知道的任何信息，那将是一个巨大的成就。为了解决这个问题，已经付出了很多努力，使用自然语言处理工具和通过许多挑战激励创造力。我们的方法重点是在自然语言问题上进行正确的实体链接，并训练一个GPT模型来从中创建SPARQL查询。我们成功地确定了这个任务中可能最难以在少数或零次尝试中解决的属性，并提出对所有实体进行预训练（在CWA下）以提高性能。在3次尝试中，我们在测试中获得了62.703%的准确的SPARQL匹配率，在实体链接挑战中获得了0.809的F1值，在问题回答挑战中获得了0.009的F1值。",
