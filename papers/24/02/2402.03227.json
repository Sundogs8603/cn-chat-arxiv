    "translated_abstract": "在MRI研究中，来自多个采集点的图像数据的聚合可以增加样本大小，但可能引入阻碍后续分析一致性的与采集点相关的变异。图像翻译的深度学习方法已经成为协调MR图像跨站点的解决方案。在本研究中，我们引入了IGUANe（具有统一对抗网络的图像生成），这是一种原始的三维模型，它结合了域转换的优势和直接应用样式转移方法来实现多中心脑MR图像协调。IGUANe通过多对一策略，集成了任意数量的域进行训练，扩展了CycleGAN架构。在推断过程中，该模型可以应用于任何图像，甚至来自未知采集点，使其成为协调的通用生成器。在由11台不同扫描仪的T1加权图像组成的数据集上进行训练，IGUANe在未见站点的数据上进行了评估。",
