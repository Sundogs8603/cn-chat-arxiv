To address these, first, we propose a generic framework to express relations between different cloud objects such as users, datastores, security roles, to model access control policies in cloud systems. Access control misconfigurations are often the primary driver for cloud attacks. Second, we develop a PDDL model for detecting security vulnerabilities which can for example lead to widespread attacks such as ransomware, sensitive data exfiltration among others. A planner can then generate attacks to identify such vulnerabilities in the cloud. Finally, we test our approach on 14 real Amazon AWS cloud configurations of different commercial organizations",

    "translated_abstract": "云计算服务提供了可扩展且具有成本效益的数据存储、处理和协作解决方案。随着它们的普及，与其安全漏洞相关的担忧也在增长，这可能导致数据泄露和勒索软件等复杂攻击。为了应对这些问题，我们首先提出了一个通用框架，用于表达云系统中不同对象（如用户、数据存储、安全角色）之间的关系，以建模云系统中的访问控制策略。访问控制误配置通常是云攻击的主要原因。其次，我们开发了一个PDDL模型，用于检测安全漏洞，例如可能导致广泛攻击（如勒索软件）和敏感数据外泄等。规划器可以生成攻击以识别云中的此类漏洞。最后，我们在14个不同商业组织的真实亚马逊AWS云配置上测试了我们的方法。",
