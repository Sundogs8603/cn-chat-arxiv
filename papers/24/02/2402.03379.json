    "translated_abstract": "上升建模在在线营销中非常重要，它旨在通过预测个体处理效果（ITE）来准确衡量不同策略（如优惠券或折扣）对不同用户的影响。在电子商务环境中，用户行为遵循确定的顺序链路，包括展示、点击和转化。营销策略在这个链路中的每个阶段都会产生不同的上升效应，影响着点击率和转化率等指标。尽管其实用性，现有研究忽视了特定处理中所有阶段的相互影响，并未充分利用处理信息，可能给后续的营销决策引入了重大偏差。本文将这两个问题称为链路偏差问题和处理不适应问题。本文介绍了一种用于解决这些问题的具有上下文增强学习的全链路上升方法（ECUP）。ECUP包括两个主要组成部分：",
