    "translated_abstract": "分类模型被期望在不同类别上表现同样良好，但在实践中，它们的表现往往存在较大差距。这个类别偏见问题在样本不平衡的数据集中得到了广泛研究，但在平衡数据集中相对被忽视。在这项工作中，我们提出了特征中的光谱不平衡概念作为类别差异的潜在来源，并研究光谱不平衡与类别偏见在理论和实践中的联系。为了建立光谱不平衡与类别差距之间的关系，我们开发了一个用于研究类别差异的理论框架，并推导了高维混合模型设定中每类错误的精确表达式。然后我们在11个不同的最先进的预训练编码器中研究了这一现象，并展示了我们提出的框架如何用于比较编码器的质量，以及评估和组合数据增强策略。",
