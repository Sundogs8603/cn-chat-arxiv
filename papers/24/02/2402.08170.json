    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）已经推动了图结构数据分析的进步。最近，大型语言模型（LLM）如GPT-4的崛起预示着深度学习的一个新时代。然而，将它们应用于图数据还面临着独特的挑战，由于将图结构转化为文本的固有难度。为此，我们引入了一个创新模型——大型语言和图形助手（LLaGA），它有效地整合了LLM的能力，以处理图结构数据的复杂性。LLaGA保留了LLM的通用性，同时将图数据转化为与LLM输入兼容的格式。LLaGA通过重新组织图节点以作为结构感知的序列，然后通过一个多功能投影仪将其映射到标记嵌入空间中。LLaGA在多样性、泛化性和可解释性方面表现出色，使其能够在不同数据集和任务上表现出一致的良好性能。",
