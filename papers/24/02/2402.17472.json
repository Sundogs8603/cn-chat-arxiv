    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络已被证明对于欺诈检测具有有效性，因为它能够在整体视角中编码节点交互和聚合特征。最近，具有出色序列编码能力的Transformer网络在文献中也表现出优于其他基于GNN的方法。然而，基于GNN和基于Transformer的网络只编码整个图的一个视角，而GNN编码全局特征，Transformer网络编码局部特征。此外，先前的工作忽视了使用单独网络编码异构图的全局交互特征，导致性能不佳。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个称为Relation-Aware GNN with transFormer（RAGFormer）的新颖框架，将局部和全局特征同时嵌入目标节点中。这个简单而有效的网络应用了一个修改后的GAGA模块，其中每个Transformer层后面都跟着一个跨关系聚合层。",
