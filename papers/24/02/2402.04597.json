    "translated_abstract": "在软件产品线(SPLs)中，由于可能存在大量有效的特征组合，测试整个产品族可能会很困难甚至不可能。因此，我们希望找到一个最小的子集，可以测试所有这些可能的组合(配对)。此外，当测试单个产品需要很大的工作量时，首先测试由一组优先级特征组成的产品是可取的。这个问题被称为优先级配对测试数据生成问题。现有的基于整数线性规划的算法对于小和中等规模的实例来说足够快。然而，由于候选解数量的指数增长，存在一些太大无法在合理时间内计算这些算法的实际实例。而且，这些启发式算法并不总是能带我们找到最好的解。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于混合元启发式算法CMSA的新方法。",
