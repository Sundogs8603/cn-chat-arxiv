    "translated_abstract": "WiFi连接的物联网设备正在从纯粹的通信设备发展为利用信道状态信息（CSI）提取能力的感知工具。然而，资源有限的物联网设备和深度神经网络的复杂性要求将CSI传输到云服务器进行感知。尽管可行，但这会导致大量的通信开销。在这种背景下，本文开发了一种新颖的实时感知和压缩网络（RSCNet），它能够通过压缩CSI来实现感知，从而减少通信开销。RSCNet在由少量CSI帧组成的CSI窗口之间进行优化。一旦传输到云服务器，它利用长短期记忆（LSTM）单元从先前的窗口中提取数据，从而增强感知准确性和CSI重建。RSCNet巧妙地平衡了CSI压缩和感知精度之间的权衡，从而简化了实时云基WiFi感知，并减少了开销。",
