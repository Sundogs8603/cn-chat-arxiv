    "translated_abstract": "我们经常以多方面的方式口头表达情感，它们在强度上可能有所变化，表达的不仅是单一的情感，还可能是各种情感的混合体。这种广泛的情感范围在情感结构模型中得到了深入研究，该模型将各种情感表示为原始情感的派生产品，具有不同程度的强度。在本文中，我们提出了一种情感文本转语音设计，旨在模拟基于结构模型的更广泛情感范围。我们提出的设计Daisy-TTS，结合了一个声调编码器，用于学习作为情感代理的可分离的声调嵌入。这种情感表示使模型能够模拟：（1）从训练样本中学到的原始情感，（2）作为原始情感的混合体的次级情感，（3）通过调整情感嵌入来实现强度级别，（4）通过否定情感嵌入来实现情感极性。",
