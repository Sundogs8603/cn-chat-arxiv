    "translated_abstract": "学习图中节点的位置信息对于链接预测任务非常重要。我们提出了使用代表性节点（称为地标）来表示位置信息的方法。我们选择少量具有高度中心度的节点作为地标，它们作为节点位置的参考点。我们证明了这种选择策略对于众所周知的随机图模型是合理的，并推导出涉及地标的平均路径长度的闭合形式上界。在幂律图的模型中，我们证明了地标为节点之间距离提供了渐近完全准确的信息。我们将理论洞察力应用于实际网络，并提出了具有地标和聚类的层级位置嵌入（HPLC）方法。HPLC将地标选择和图聚类相结合，其中图被分割为连通密集的聚类，选择具有最高度中心度的节点作为地标。HPLC利用了基于地标的节点位置信息的层级性。",
