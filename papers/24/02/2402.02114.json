    "title": "Handling Delayed Feedback in Distributed Online Optimization : A Projection-Free Approach",
    "abstract": "Learning at the edges has become increasingly important as large quantities of data are continually generated locally. Among others, this paradigm requires algorithms that are simple (so that they can be executed by local devices), robust (again uncertainty as data are continually generated), and reliable in a distributed manner under network issues, especially delays. In this study, we investigate the problem of online convex optimization under adversarial delayed feedback. We propose two projection-free algorithms for centralised and distributed settings in which they are carefully designed to achieve a regret bound of O(\\sqrt{B}) where B is the sum of delay, which is optimal for the OCO problem in the delay setting while still being projection-free. We provide an extensive theoretical study and experimentally validate the performance of our algorithms by comparing them with existing ones on real-world problems.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着本地不断产生大量数据，边缘学习变得越来越重要。在这种范式下，需要简单（以便本地设备可以执行）和可靠的算法，以应对不确定性和网络问题，尤其是延迟。本研究探讨了在对抗性延迟反馈下的在线凸优化问题。我们提出了两种投影无关算法，用于中心化和分布式设置，并仔细设计以实现O(\\sqrt{B})的遗憾界，其中B是延迟总和，对于延迟设置中的OCO问题来说是最优的，同时仍然是投影无关的。我们进行了广泛的理论研究，并通过与现有算法在实际问题上的比较来实验验证我们算法的性能。",
