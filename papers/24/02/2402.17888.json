    "translated_abstract": "后续异常分布（OOD）检测在可靠机器学习中受到密切关注。许多工作致力于推导基于logits、距离或严格数据分布假设的评分函数，以识别得分低的OOD样本。然而，这些估计得分可能无法准确反映真实数据密度或施加不切实际的约束。为了在基于密度得分设计方面提供一个统一的视角，我们提出了一个以Bregman散度为基础的新颖理论框架，该框架将分布考虑扩展到涵盖一系列指数族分布。利用我们定理中揭示的共轭约束，我们引入了一种\\textsc{ConjNorm}方法，将密度函数设计重新构想为针对给定数据集搜索最佳规范系数$p$的过程。鉴于归一化的计算挑战，我们设计了一种无偏和解析可追踪的方法",
