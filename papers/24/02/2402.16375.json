    "translated_abstract": "对低概率、高影响风险的自愿保险需求低于预期。为了评估需求的规模，我们对使用实验激励和基于调查的估计的数据集进行了一项关联估价研究的元分析。 我们发现，保险的平均愿意支付金额（WTP）为预期损失的87％。我们进行了一项元回归分析，以检验这些研究中WTP的总体异质性。 元回归显示，损失概率和概率水平的信息积极影响相对愿意支付，而受访者的平均收入和年龄则具有负面影响。此外，我们确定了文化子因素，例如权力距离和不确定性回避，进一步解释了国际样本中WTP差异。 与抽样和数据收集过程相关的方法ological因素显著。",
    "tldr": "该研究通过元分析发现，对低概率、高影响风险的保险需求低于预期，平均愿意支付金额为预期损失的87％，并发现信息和受访者特征对愿意支付金额有不同影响，同时文化因素也在不同国际样本中影响着愿意支付金额。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study conducts a meta-analysis and finds that the demand for insurance against low-probability, high-impact risks is lower than expected, with an average stated willingness to pay at 87% of expected losses. Information, respondent characteristics, and cultural factors all play a role in influencing willingness to pay across different international samples."
