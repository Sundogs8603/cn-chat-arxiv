However, existing retrieval methods that retrieve in a single hop do not pay attention to the text-to-SQL challenge of schema linking, which is aligning the entities in the question with table entities, reflected in two aspects: similar irrelevant entity and domain mismatch entity. Therefore, we propose our method, the multi-hop table retrieval with rewrite and beam search (Murre). To reduce the effect of the similar irrelevant entity, our method focuses on unretrieved entities at each hop and considers the low-ranked tables by beam search. To alleviate the limitation of domain mismatch entity, Murre rewrites the question based on retrieved tables in multiple hops, decreasing the domain gap with relevant tables.

    "translated_abstract": "开放域文本到SQL是一个重要任务，它从庞大的数据库中检索与问题相关的表，然后生成SQL。然而，现有的单跳检索方法并未关注文本到SQL挑战中的模式链接，这涉及到将问题中的实体与表中实体对齐，主要体现在两个方面：相似的无关实体和领域不匹配实体。因此，我们提出了我们的方法，即带重写和波束搜索的多跳表检索（Murre）。为了减少相似的无关实体的影响，我们的方法侧重于每个跳跃中未检索到的实体，并通过波束搜索考虑排名较低的表。为了缓解领域不匹配实体的限制，Murre基于多个跳跃中检索到的表重写问题，减少与相关表的领域差距。我们在SpiderUnion和BirdUnion+上进行实验，取得了新的最先进结果。",
