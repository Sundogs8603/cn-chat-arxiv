    "translated_abstract": "大语言模型(LLM)最近已经成为各种自然语言处理任务的强大工具，为LLM和推荐系统的结合带来了新的潮流，称为LLM-based RS。目前的方法通常分为两种主要范例，即ID直接使用范例和ID翻译范例，指出它们的核心弱点在于缺乏推荐知识和独特性。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一种新的范例，即ID表示，它以一种互补的方式将预训练的ID嵌入到LLMs中。在这项工作中，我们提出了RA-Rec，一种基于LLM的推荐系统的高效ID表示对齐框架，与多种基于ID的方法和LLM架构兼容。具体而言，我们将ID嵌入视为软提示，并设计了一种创新的对齐模块和一种用于对齐的高效调整方法，以及为对齐定制的数据构建。大量实验证明，RA-Rec在性能上显著优于其他方法。",
