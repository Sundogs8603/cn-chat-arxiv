    "translated_abstract": "上下文化嵌入是建模词汇语义变化（LSC）的首选工具。当前的评估通常专注于称为分级变化检测（GCD）的特定任务。然而，由于它们依赖于不同设置，跨作品的性能比较经常具有误导性。在本文中，我们在相同条件下评估了GCD的最新模型和方法。我们进一步将LSC问题分解为上下文中的单词（WiC）和词义归纳（WSI）任务，并比较这些不同级别的模型。我们在八个可用的LSC基准测试中跨不同语言进行评估，结果表明：（i）APD在GCD方面优于其他方法；（ii）XL-LEXEME在WiC、WSI和GCD方面优于其他上下文化模型，同时与GPT-4相当；（iii）明显需要改进对词义建模以及关注这些意义何时、如何和为何变化的工作。",
