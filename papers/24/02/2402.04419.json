    "translated_abstract": "由于高质量的疾病标签的稀缺性，弱监督学习与嘈杂数据成为医学影像学界关注的焦点。然而，对这种弱监督学习的限制以及这些约束对疾病分类性能的影响知之甚少。在本文中，我们通过研究三个条件来测试这种弱监督的影响。首先，我们逐渐增加训练数据中标签错误来检查模型对嘈杂数据的容忍度。其次，我们通过改变训练数据的数量来评估数据集大小对性能的影响。第三，我们比较了二元分类和多标签分类之间的性能差异。结果表明，模型可以在添加了10%的标签错误之前忍受，而疾病分类性能会出现下降。对于所有疾病类别，随着训练数据量的增加，疾病分类性能稳步提升，然后出现了下降。",
