    "translated_abstract": "早期时间分类算法旨在在不处理完整输入流的情况下对特征流进行标记，同时保持与应用分类器到整个输入时相当的准确性。在本文中，我们引入了一个可以应用于任何顺序分类器的统计框架，制定了一个校准停止规则。这个数据驱动的规则在完全分类和早期时间分类之间的准确度间隔上获得了有限样本的、分布无关的控制。我们首先提出了一种新颖的方法，借鉴了学习-测试校准框架，在独立同分布实例上对这个间隔进行了平均控制。由于这种算法往往会产生过高的早停时间准确度间隔，我们的主要贡献是提出了一个框架，该框架在累计停止时间的条件下控制了一种更强的错误概念，其中准确度间隔受到控制。数值实验证明了该方法的有效性、适用性和实用性。",
