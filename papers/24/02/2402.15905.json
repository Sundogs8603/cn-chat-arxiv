We first fine-tune five pre-trained CNNs and minimize the overall cost of misclassification by prioritizing accuracy for certain classes that have higher associated costs or importance. To further enhance the performance of the models, supervised contrastive learning is included to make the models more adept at capturing important features and patterns. Extensive experimentation are conducted to evaluate the proposed system on the SIPaKMeD dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed system, achieving an accuracy of 97.29%. To make our system more trustworthy, we have employed several explainable AI techniques to interpret how the models reached a specific decision.

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个高效的系统，使用预训练的卷积神经网络（CNNs）对宫颈癌细胞进行分类。我们首先微调了五个预训练的CNNs，并通过优先考虑具有更高相关成本或重要性的类别的准确性来最小化总的误分类成本。为了进一步提高模型的性能，我们加入了监督对比学习，使模型更擅长捕捉重要特征和模式。对提出的系统在SIPaKMeD数据集上进行了大量实验评估。实验结果表明，该系统的有效性，达到了97.29%的准确率。为了使我们的系统更加可信，我们采用了几种可解释的人工智能技术来解释模型是如何做出具体决策的。系统的实现可在以下网址找到 - https://github.com/isha-67/CervicalCancerStudy.",
