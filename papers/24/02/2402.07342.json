We arrive at three affordances -- dynamic grounding, constructive negotiation, and sustainable motivation -- that summarize latent qualities of natural language-enabled foundation models that, if explicitly designed for, can support the process of design. Through design fiction, we then imagine a future interface as a diegetic prototype, the story of Squirrel Game, that demonstrates each of our three affordances in a realistic usage scenario. Our design process, terminology, and diagrams aim to contribute to future discussions about the relative affordances of AI technology with regard to collaborating with human designers.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们构思了一个涉及AI技术的未来设计工作流程。借鉴活动和交流理论，我们试图分离大型AI模型与过去技术相比在设计中提供的新价值。我们得出了三个可行性——动态建模，建设性协商和可持续激励，总结了自然语言能力基础模型的潜在特性，如果明确设计，可以支持设计过程。通过设计虚构，我们想象了一个未来的界面作为一个故事原型，松鼠游戏的故事，在一个真实的使用情境中展示了我们的三个可行性。我们的设计过程、术语和图表旨在为将来关于AI技术在与人类设计师合作方面的相对可行性讨论做出贡献。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了一个涉及AI技术的未来设计工作流程，强调了动态建模，建设性协商和可持续激励三个关键点，这些点可以支持设计过程，并为AI技术与人类设计师合作的相对可行性提供了新思路。",
