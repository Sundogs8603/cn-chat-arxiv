We propose a theoretical framework that formalizes one key distinction between the two forms of evaluation: Machine learning algorithms are standardized, fixing a common set of covariates by which to assess all individuals, while human evaluators customize which covariates are acquired to each individual.

    "translated_abstract": "评估曾经只在人类专家领域内进行（例如医生进行的医学诊断），现在也可以通过机器学习算法进行。这引发了一个新的概念问题：被人类和算法评估之间有什么区别，在什么时候个人应该更喜欢其中一种形式的评估？我们提出了一个理论框架，形式化了这两种评估形式之间的一个关键区别：机器学习算法是标准化的，通过固定的共变量来评估所有个体，而人类评估者则根据个体定制获取哪些共变量。我们的框架定义并分析了这种定制化的优势——上下文的价值，在具有非常高维数据的环境中。我们表明，除非代理人对共变量的联合分布有精确的知识，更多共变量的价值超过了上下文的价值。",
