Data filtering for instruction tuning has proved important in improving both the efficiency and performance of the tuning process.

To reduce the filtering cost, we study Superfiltering: Can we use a smaller and weaker model to select data for finetuning a larger and stronger model? Despite the performance gap between weak and strong language models, we find their highly consistent capability to perceive instruction difficulty and data selection results. This enables us to use a much smaller and more efficient model to filter the instruction data used to train a larger language model.

    "translated_abstract": "指令调整对于改进LLM至关重要，但通常会遇到低质量和冗余数据的问题。指令调整的数据过滤在提高调整过程的效率和性能方面已被证明很重要。但是，由于LLMs在该过程中的参与，这也导致了额外的成本和计算。为了减少过滤成本，我们研究了超级过滤：可以使用较小且较弱的模型来选择要调整更大和更强模型的数据吗？尽管弱和强语言模型之间存在性能差距，但我们发现它们高度一致的能力可以感知指令的难度和数据选择结果。这使得我们可以使用一个更小更高效的模型来过滤用于训练更大语言模型的指令数据。它不仅大大加快了数据过滤的速度，而且经过过滤数据微调的LLM在标准基准测试中取得了更好的性能。大量实验证实了其有效性和效率。",
