We start with a carefully tuned Proportional Integrator (PI) controller and exploit the recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Guides to improve the closed-loop behavior by learning from the additional interactions with the valve. We test the proposed control method in various scenarios on three different valves, all highlighting the benefits of combining both PI and RL frameworks to improve control performance in non-linear stochastic systems. In all the experimental test cases, the resulting agent has a better sample efficiency than traditional RL agents and outperforms the PI controller.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种基于学习的控制策略，用于非线性节流阀，该节流阀具有不对称的磁滞，实现了一个几乎最优的控制器，而不需要任何关于环境的先验知识。我们首先通过精心调整的比例积分（PI）控制器开始，并利用强化学习（RL）与引导的最新进展，通过从与阀门的额外交互中学习来改进闭环行为。我们在三个不同的阀门上的各种场景中测试了所提出的控制方法，所有这些都突显了将PI和RL框架结合以提高非线性随机系统控制性能的好处。在所有实验测试案例中，结果代理的样本效率都优于传统RL代理，并且优于PI控制器。",
