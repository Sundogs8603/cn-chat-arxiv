    "translated_abstract": "准确定义、衡量和缓解风险是金融风险管理的基石，尤其是在金融传染存在的情况下。传统的基于相关性的风险评估方法在市场波动条件下常常难以应对，特别是面对外部冲击时，凸显了对更强大和不变的预测方法的需求。本文介绍了一种名为因果网络传染风险价值评估（Causal-NECO VaR）的新方法，该方法在金融风险分析中显著推进了因果推断。这种方法采用因果网络框架，巧妙地捕捉并分析波动效应和溢出效应，有效地使其与传统的传染性VaR模型区别开来。Causal-NECO VaR的关键创新在于它能够从观测数据中推导资产之间的方向性影响，从而提供稳健的风险预测，使其对市场冲击和系统变化保持不变。",
