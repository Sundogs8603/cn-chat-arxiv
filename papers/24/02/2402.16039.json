    "translated_abstract": "会话代理（CAs）越来越多地融入日常生活，引发了社交媒体上的重要讨论。尽管先前的研究已经考察了公众对AI的看法，但关于CAs的研究明显不足，对文化差异在CA看法中的研究更少。为填补这一空白，本研究使用计算方法分析了约一百万个围绕CAs的社交媒体讨论，并比较了美国和中国人对CAs的话语和看法。我们发现，中国参与者倾向于愉悦地看待CAs，认为基于语音和具有实体表现的CAs更温暖和更有能力，并一般表达积极情绪。相比之下，美国参与者更看重CAs的功能性，持有矛盾的态度。温暖的看法是两国对CAs产生积极情绪的关键因素。我们讨论了为设计环境适应型CAs的实际影响。",
