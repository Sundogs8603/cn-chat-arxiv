Early recognition and intervention of children with SSD and timely referral to speech and language therapists (SLTs) for treatment are crucial. Automated detection of speech impairment is regarded as an efficient method for examining and screening large populations. This study focuses on advancing the automatic diagnosis of SSD in early childhood by proposing a technical solution that integrates ultrasound tongue imaging (UTI) with deep-learning models. The introduced FusionNet model combines UTI data with the extracted texture features to classify UTI. The overarching aim is to elevate the accuracy and efficiency of UTI analysis, particularly for classifying speech sounds associated with SSD. This study compared the FusionNet approach with standard deep-learning metho",
