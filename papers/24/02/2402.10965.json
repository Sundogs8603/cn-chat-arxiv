    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的进展为医疗健康领域提供了新机遇，可以改善患者护理、临床决策以及提升医师和管理人员的工作流程。然而，这些模型的潜力重要取决于它们在临床环境和人群中有效泛化的能力，这是在早期开发中经常被低估的挑战。为了更好地理解这些挑战的原因并制定缓解方法，我们评估了ClinicLLM，这是一个在 [HOSPITAL] 的临床笔记上训练的LLM模型，对其在30天全因素再入院预测中的表现进行分析，关注跨医院和患者特征的变异性。我们发现在样本较少的医院、政府和未指定保险的患者、老年人以及高共病性患者中，泛化效果较差。为了了解泛化不彰的原因，我们调查了样本量",
