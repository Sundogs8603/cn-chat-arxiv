    "translated_abstract": "鉴于一组概率分布，从业者有时需要找到一种“平均”分布，以充分聚合参考分布。一个理论上有吸引力的平均分布概念是Wasserstein重心，而我们的工作重点就是它。通过建立在最优传输的对偶形式之上，我们提出了一种新的可扩展方法来解决Wasserstein重心问题。我们的方法基于最近的神经最优传输求解器：它具有双层对抗学习目标，并适用于一般的成本函数。这些是我们方法的关键优势，因为典型的利用重心任务的对抗性算法往往利用三层优化，并且主要集中在二次成本上。我们还为我们提出的方法建立了理论误差界，并展示了它在示例场景和图像数据设置上的适用性和有效性。",

The proposed method has the advantage of bi-level adversarial learning and general cost function applicability, overcoming the limitations of traditional adversarial algorithms which primarily focus on quadratic cost and require tri-level optimization. Theoretical error bounds are established, and the effectiveness of the method is demonstrated in illustrative scenarios and image data setups."
