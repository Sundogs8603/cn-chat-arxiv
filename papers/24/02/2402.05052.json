    "translated_abstract": "在许多问题中，测量变量（例如图像像素）只是隐藏的因果变量（例如潜在的概念或对象）的数学函数。为了在不断变化的环境中进行预测或对系统进行适当的更改，恢复隐藏的因果变量$Z_i$以及由图$\\mathcal{G}_Z$表示的它们的因果关系是有帮助的。这个问题最近被称为因果表示学习。本文关注来自多个分布（来自异构数据或非平稳时间序列）的因果表示学习的通用、完全非参数的设置，不需要假设分布改变背后存在硬干预。我们旨在在这个基本情况下开发通用解决方案；作为副产品，这有助于看到其他假设（如参数因果模型或硬干预）提供的独特好处。我们证明在恢复过程中对图的稀疏性约束下，可以从多个分布中学习出因果关系。",
