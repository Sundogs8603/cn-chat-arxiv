Addressing the challenges posed by partial information and the curse of multi-agency, we developed Thompson sampling-type algorithms, leveraging information about opponent's action and reward structures. Our approach significantly reduces experimental budgets, achieving a more than tenfold reduction compared to baseline algorithms in practical applications like traffic routing and radar sensing. We demonstrate that, under certain assumptions about the reward structure, the regret bound exhibits merely a logarithmic dependence on the total action space size, effectively mitigating the curse of multi-agency. Additionally, this research introduces the Optimism-then-NoRegret framework, a novel contribution that integrates both our proposed methodologies and existing algorithms in the field.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多涉及多个决策者的真实世界问题可以建模为一个具有部分观测的未知博弈。为了解决部分信息和多机构的挑战，我们开发了汤普森抽样类型的算法，利用对手的行动和奖励结构的信息。我们的方法在实际应用中，如交通路由和雷达感知中，显著减少了实验预算，与基准算法相比，减少了十倍以上。我们证明，在对奖励结构有一定假设的情况下，遗憾界限仅对总行动空间大小呈对数依赖，有效缓解了多机构问题。此外，本研究引入了乐观-无遗憾框架，该框架将我们提出的方法和领域内现有的算法相结合，是一项新的贡献。",
