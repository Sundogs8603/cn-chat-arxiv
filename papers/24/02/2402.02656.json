    "translated_abstract": "半结构化访谈(SSIs)是医疗研究中常用的数据收集方法，可以提供深入的定性洞察力。尽管其价值很大，但由于情绪反应的提取和分类困难，以及对大规模人群进行人工评估的挑战，SSIs的手动分析被众所周知地耗时且劳动密集。在本研究中，我们开发了RACER，一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的专家引导的自动化流程，可以高效地将原始访谈记录转化为有洞见的领域相关主题和子主题。我们使用RACER对93名医疗专业人员和实习生进行的SSIs进行分析，以评估COVID-19危机对个人和专业心理健康的广泛影响。RACER与两个人工评估员之间达到了适度高的一致性（72%），接近人际一致性（77%）。有趣的是，LLMs和人类在处理类似内容时都存在困难。",
