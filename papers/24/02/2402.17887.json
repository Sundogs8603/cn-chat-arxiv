In this context, Large Language Models (LLMs) play an increasingly vital role in medical knowledge acquisition and question-answering systems. To further improve the performance of these systems in the medical domain, we introduce an innovative method that jointly trains an Information Retrieval (IR) system and an LLM during the fine-tuning phase. This approach, which we call Joint Medical LLM and Retrieval Training (JMLR), is designed to overcome the challenges faced by traditional models in handling medical question-answering tasks.
