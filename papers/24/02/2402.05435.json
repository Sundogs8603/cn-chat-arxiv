    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型在生成各种叙述方面发挥重要作用，促进了对其在叙述形式中传达生活事件效果的系统探索。本研究利用零-shot结构化叙事提示，使用OpenAI的GPT-4生成了24,000个叙述。从这个数据集中，我们手动分类了2,880个叙述，并评估它们在传达出生、死亡、招聘和解雇事件方面的有效性。令人惊讶的是，87.43%的叙述足够传达结构化提示的意图。为了自动识别有效和无效的叙述，我们对分类数据集训练和验证了九个机器学习模型。利用这些模型，我们扩展了对剩余21,120个叙述的分类预测分析。所有的机器学习模型在将有效的叙述分类为有效方面表现出色，但在同时将无效的叙述分类为无效方面存在挑战。我们的研究结果不仅推进了这一领域的发展，还提供了自动识别有效叙述的有益信息。",

The majority of the narratives sufficiently convey the intended meaning of the prompt. Additionally, machine learning models can be used to automate the identification of valid and invalid narratives."
