However, there has not been much effort toward enhancing the strategy of dreaming itself. Therefore, it is a question whether and how an agent can \"dream better\" in a more structured and strategic way. In this paper, inspired by the observation from cognitive science suggesting that humans use a spatial divide-and-conquer strategy in planning, we propose a new MBRL agent, called Dr. Strategy, which is equipped with a novel Dreaming Strategy. The proposed agent realizes a version of divide-and-conquer-like strategy in dreaming. This is achieved by learning a set of latent landmarks and then utilizing these to learn a landmark-conditioned highway policy. With the highway policy, the agent can first learn in the dream to move to a landmark, and from there it tackles the exploration and achi",

    "translated_abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning（MBRL）一直是改善样本效率问题并创建通用型Agent的主要方法。然而，对于增强梦想策略本身的努力并不多。在本文中，受认知科学观察到人类在规划时使用空间分隔与征服策略的启发，我们提出了一个新的MBRL agent，称为Dr. Strategy，它配备了一种新颖的Dreaming Strategy。所提出的Agent在梦境中实现了一种类似于分隔与征服的策略。",
