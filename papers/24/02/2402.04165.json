    "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of continuous change, Machine Learning (ML) \"nowcasting\" models offer a distinct advantage for informed decision-making in both public and private sectors. This study introduces ML-based GDP growth projection models for monthly rates in Peru, integrating structured macroeconomic indicators with high-frequency unstructured sentiment variables. Analyzing data from January 2007 to May 2023, encompassing 91 leading economic indicators, the study evaluates six ML algorithms to identify optimal predictors. Findings highlight the superior predictive capability of ML models using unstructured data, particularly Gradient Boosting Machine, LASSO, and Elastic Net, exhibiting a 20% to 25% reduction in prediction errors compared to traditional AR and Dynamic Factor Models (DFM). This enhanced performance is attributed to better handling of data of ML models in high-uncertainty periods, such as economic crises.",

    "translated_abstract": "在不断变化的动态环境中，机器学习（ML）“现在预测”模型为公共和私营部门的明智决策提供了独特的优势。本研究介绍了用于秘鲁月度GDP增长预测的基于ML的模型，将结构化的宏观经济指标与高频非结构化情绪变量进行整合。通过分析2007年1月至2023年5月的数据，包括91个领先经济指标，本研究评估了6种ML算法以确定最佳预测指标。结果表明，使用非结构化数据的ML模型具有优越的预测能力，尤其是梯度提升机、LASSO和弹性网络，与传统的AR和动态因子模型（DFM）相比，其预测误差减少了20%至25%。这种改进的性能归因于ML模型在高不确定性期间（如经济危机）对数据的更好处理能力。",
