    "translated_abstract": "社交网络在信息共享方面至关重要，尤其在健康领域用于讨论疾病和治疗。然而，这些平台上的帖子往往是简短的文本，给人工智能在理解上带来了挑战。我们介绍了一种创新的混合方法，结合社区维护的知识图谱（如Wikidata）和深度学习，以增强社交媒体帖子的分类。该方法利用先进的实体识别器和链接器（如Falcon 2.0）将短文帖子中的实体连接到知识图谱。然后使用知识图谱嵌入（KGEs）和上下文化词嵌入（如BERT）来创建丰富的、基于语境的帖子表示。我们的重点是健康领域，特别是识别与饮食障碍相关的帖子（如厌食症、暴食症），以帮助医疗服务提供者进行早期诊断。我们在一个包含2,000条关于饮食障碍的推文的数据集上测试了我们的方法，发现合并单词嵌入和上下文化嵌入可以显著提高检测性能。",
    "tldr": "这项研究提出了一种新颖的方法，通过结合知识图谱和深度学习，借助实体识别和链接技术以及上下文化嵌入，增强了机器学习模型对社交媒体帖子的分类能力。该方法主要应用于健康领域的饮食障碍识别，为早期诊断提供帮助。"
