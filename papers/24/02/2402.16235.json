Most approaches and tools for presenting these examples to students are based on line-by-line explanations of the example code. However, instructors rarely have time to provide line-by-line explanations for a large number of examples typically used in a programming class. In this paper, we explore and assess a human-AI collaboration approach to authoring worked examples for Java programming. We introduce an authoring system for creating Java worked examples that generates a starting version of code explanations and presents it to the instructor to edit if necessary.We also present a study that assesses the quality of explanations created with this approach",

    "translated_abstract": "工作示例（典型编程问题的解决方案，以某种语言的源代码呈现，并用于解释编程课程中的主题）是编程课程中最受欢迎的学习内容之一。大多数用于向学生展示这些示例的方法和工具都基于对示例代码的逐行解释。然而，教师很少有时间为编程课程中通常使用的大量示例提供逐行解释。本文探讨并评估了一种人工智能与人类合作的方法，用于为Java编程撰写示例。我们介绍了一个用于创建Java工作示例的编写系统，该系统生成代码解释的初始版本，并将其呈现给教师以在必要时进行编辑。我们还提出了一项评估使用此方法创建的解释质量的研究。",
