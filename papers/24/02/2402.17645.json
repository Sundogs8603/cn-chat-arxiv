    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了SongComposer，一个为歌曲创作而设计的创新型LLM。它能够理解和生成歌曲中的旋律和歌词，通过利用LLM的能力在符号化的歌曲表示中生成。现有的与音乐相关的LLM将音乐视为量化的音频信号，而这种隐式编码导致了编码效率低下和灵活性差。相比之下，我们采用了符号化的歌曲表示，这是人类为音乐设计的成熟和高效的方式，并使LLM能够像人类一样明确地创作歌曲。在实践中，我们设计了一种新颖的元组设计，用于格式化歌词和旋律中的三个音符属性（音高、持续时间和休止时间），从而保证LLM对音乐符号的正确理解，并实现歌词和旋律之间的精确对齐。为了向LLM灌输基本的音乐理解，我们精心收集了SongCompose-PT，一个大规模的歌曲预训练数据集，其中包括了歌词、旋律和成对的",
