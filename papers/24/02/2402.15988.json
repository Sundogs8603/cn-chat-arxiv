Fairness in graphs is particularly crucial in anomaly detection areas such as misinformation detection in search/ranking systems, where decision outcomes can significantly affect individuals. However, the current literature does not comprehensively discuss this problem, nor does it provide realistic datasets that encompass actual graph structures, anomaly labels, and sensitive attributes for research in FairGAD. To bridge this gap, we introduce a formal definition of the FairGAD problem and present two novel graph datasets constructed from the globally prominent social media platforms Reddit and Twitter. These datasets comprise 1.2 million and 400,000 edges associated with 9,000 and 47,000 ",

    "translated_abstract": "公平图异常检测（FairGAD）问题旨在在输入图中准确检测异常节点，同时确保公平性，避免针对来自敏感亚组如性别或政治倾向的个体的偏见预测。图中的公平性在异常检测领域尤为关键，比如在搜索/排名系统中进行的误信息检测，决策结果可能会极大地影响个人。然而，当前文献没有全面讨论这个问题，也没有提供贴近实际图结构、异常标签和敏感属性的数据集，以用于FairGAD研究。为弥补这一不足，我们介绍了FairGAD问题的正式定义，并提出了两个新颖的图数据集，这些数据集来自于全球知名社交媒体平台Reddit和Twitter。",
