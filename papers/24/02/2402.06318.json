In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) model, TimEHR, to generate time series data from EHRs. In particular, TimEHR treats time series as images and is based on two conditional GANs. The first GAN generates missingness patterns, and the second GAN generates time series values based on the missingness pattern. Experimental results on three real-world EHR datasets show that TimEHR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics.",
