    "translated_abstract": "近年来，神经网络已被用于解决成像中的相位恢复问题，其准确性和速度优于传统技术，尤其是在存在噪声的情况下。然而，在干涉成像的背景下，现有的神经网络架构对相位噪声的处理很少。这种噪声在干涉仪中自然产生，由于机械不稳定性或大气湍流，限制了测量采集时间，并在光强有限的情况下（例如遥感）造成挑战。在这里，我们引入了一种三维二维相位恢复U-Net（PRUNe），该网络以噪声和随机相移的干涉图作为输入，并输出一个二维相位图像。一个三维下采样的卷积编码器捕捉帧内和帧间的相关性，产生一个二维潜在空间，该空间通过一个二维解码器上采样成一个相位图像。我们将我们的模型与最先进的奇异值分解算法进行对比，并发现PRUNe具有更高的恢复精度和准确性。",
