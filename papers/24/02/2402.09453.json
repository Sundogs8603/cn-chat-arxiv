    "translated_abstract": "静息生态（EEG）在记录脑部活动中起着重要作用，并且对脑机接口（BCI）技术的发展至关重要。然而，EEG信号的有限可用性和高度变异性给创建可靠的BCI带来了巨大的挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个实际的解决方案，利用深度学习和Wasserstein生成对抗网络（WGAN）的最新发展。WGAN是在BCI2000数据集上进行训练的，该数据集包括来自45个个体的约1500个EEG记录和64个通道。通过三个分类器评估生成的EEG信号，得到了改进的平均准确率。使用Frechet Inception Distance（FID）测量的生成信号质量为1.345（睁眼）和11.565（闭眼）。即使没有频谱或空间损失项，我们的WGAN模型仍能模拟出频谱和空间特性。",
