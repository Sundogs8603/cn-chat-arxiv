    "translated_abstract": "假新闻的泛滥已成为一个严重的社会问题，引起了行业和学术界的广泛关注。虽然现有的基于深度学习的方法在准确检测假新闻方面取得了进展，但它们的可靠性可能会受到非透明推理过程、差强人意的推广能力以及与大型语言模型（LLMs）集成的固有风险的影响。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的框架，名为TELLER，用于可信的假新闻检测，重点关注模型的可解释性、可推广性和可控制性。这通过一个融合认知和决策系统的双系统框架来实现，遵循以上原则。认知系统利用人类专业知识生成逻辑谓词，指导LLMs生成可读的逻辑原子。同时，决策系统推导可推广的逻辑规则来聚合这些原子，实现真实和虚假新闻的识别。",
