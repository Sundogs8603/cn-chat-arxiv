    "translated_abstract": "卫星数据有潜力为机器学习带来一次重大的改变，我们需要重新思考针对传统数据模态设计的现有实践。随着卫星数据的机器学习（SatML）在现实世界中产生重大影响，我们的领域正处于一个十字路口。我们可以继续应用不适合的方法，或者我们可以发起一个以卫星数据的独特特征和挑战为中心的新研究议程。本文认为卫星数据构成了机器学习研究的一种独特模态，而我们必须承认这一点，以推动SatML在理论、方法和部署方面的质量和影响力。我们概述了关键性的讨论问题和可行性建议，将SatML从仅仅一个有趣的应用领域转变为一个致力于推动机器学习和社会重大挑战的专门研究学科。",
