    "translated_abstract": "由于感知能力有限、通信延迟高和操作者侧自由度有限，远程操作可能非常困难。自主远程操作通过预测用户意图并自主执行某些任务的一部分，以减少对操作者的需求，提高任务完成率。然而，模式切换的决策通常假设由操作者完成，这增加了操作者要控制的自由度，并引入了额外的心理负担。另一方面，目前的文献中并未研究通信的角度，尽管通信不完美和资源限制是远程操作的主要瓶颈。在本研究中，我们提出了一种智能模式切换框架，同时考虑模式切换和通信系统。用户意图识别在操作者一侧完成。基于用户意图识别，一个深度强化学习算法被用于决定何时切换到自主模式。",

By predicting user intentions and autonomously performing parts of the task, it reduces the demand on the operator and increases task completion rate."
