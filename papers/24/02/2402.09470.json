This paper explores Rolling Diffusion: a new approach that uses a sliding window denoising process. It ensures that the diffusion process progressively corrupts through time by assigning more noise to frames that appear later in a sequence, reflecting greater uncertainty about the future as the generation process unfolds. Empirically, we show that when the temporal dynamics are complex, Rolling Diffusion is superior to standard diffusion.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，扩散模型越来越多地应用于时间数据，如视频、流体力学模拟或气候数据。这些方法通常将后续帧在扩散过程中的噪声量视为相等。本文探讨了滚动扩散：一种使用滑动窗口去噪的新方法。它确保扩散过程逐渐通过时间进行破坏，通过将更多的噪声分配给序列中出现较晚的帧，反映出随着生成过程的展开，对未来的不确定性越来越大。通过实证研究，我们表明当时间动态复杂时，滚动扩散优于标准扩散。特别是在使用Kinetics-600视频数据集进行视频预测任务和混沌流体动力学预测实验中证明了这一结果。",
    "tldr": "本文介绍了一种滚动扩散模型，用于处理时间数据，通过滑动窗口去噪并根据帧在序列中的时间先后分配不同的噪声量，更好地捕捉到复杂的时间动态。通过实验证明，在视频预测和混沌流体动力学预测任务中，该模型优于传统扩散方法。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper introduces a rolling diffusion model for handling temporal data, which uses a sliding window denoising process and assigns different amounts of noise to frames based on their ordering in the sequence, capturing complex temporal dynamics better. Empirical results show that this model outperforms traditional diffusion methods in video prediction and chaotic fluid dynamics forecasting tasks."
