Therefore, it is necessary to construct a Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) method to resist quantum computing attacks. Therefore, this study proposes a PQC-based neural network that maps a code-based PQC method to a neural network structure and enhances the security of ciphertexts with non-linear activation functions, random perturbation of ciphertexts, and uniform distribution of ciphertexts. In practical experiments, this study uses cellular network signals as a case study to demonstrate that encryption and decryption can be performed by the proposed PQC-based neural network with the uniform distribution of ciphertexts. In the future, the proposed PQC-based neural network could be applied to various applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，量子计算机和Shor量子算法对当前主流的非对称加密方法（例如RSA和椭圆曲线加密（ECC））构成威胁。因此，有必要构建一种后量子密码（PQC）方法来抵抗量子计算攻击。本研究提出了一种基于PQC的神经网络，将基于编码的PQC方法映射到神经网络结构，并通过非线性激活函数、随机扰动的密文以及密文的均匀分布增强了密文的安全性。在实际实验中，本研究以蜂窝网络信号为案例研究，证明了建议的基于PQC的神经网络可以通过密文的均匀分布进行加密和解密。未来，这种提出的基于PQC的神经网络可以应用于各种应用中。",
