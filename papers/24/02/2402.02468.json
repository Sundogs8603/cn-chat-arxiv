    "abstract": "Fast adapting to unknown peers (partners or opponents) with different strategies is a key challenge in multi-agent games. To do so, it is crucial for the agent to efficiently probe and identify the peer's strategy, as this is the prerequisite for carrying out the best response in adaptation.

In this paper, we propose a peer identification reward, which rewards the learning agent based on how well it can identify the behavior pattern of the peer over the historical context, such as the observation over multiple episodes. This reward motivates the agent to learn a context-aware policy for effective exploration and fast adaptation, i.e., to actively seek and collect informative feedback from peers when uncertain about their policies and to exploit the context to perform the best response when confident. We evaluate our method on diverse testbeds ",

    "translated_abstract": "在多智能体游戏中，快速适应具有不同策略的未知同伴是一个关键挑战。为了做到这一点，智能体能够高效地探索和识别同伴的策略至关重要，因为这是适应中进行最佳反应的先决条件。然而，当游戏是部分可观测且时间跨度很长时，探索未知同伴的策略是困难的。在本文中，我们提出了一种同伴识别奖励，根据智能体在历史环境下（例如多个回合的观察）如何有效地识别同伴的行为模式来奖励学习智能体。这个奖励激励智能体学习一种基于上下文的策略，以实现有效探索和快速适应，即在对同伴策略不确定时积极寻找和收集信息反馈，并在有信心时利用上下文执行最佳反应。我们在不同的测试场景上进行了评估。",
