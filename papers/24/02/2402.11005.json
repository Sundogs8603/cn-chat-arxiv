    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）被部署在各种应用中，并且它们的响应对社会产生着越来越大的影响。理解LLMs在给出响应时的非故意机制对于解释它们的性能并辨别它们在现实世界应用中的偏差至关重要。这类似于人类研究中，这种无意识的响应被称为抽样。我们研究了LLMs的这种抽样现象，发现LLMs的抽样倾向于偏爱高价值选项。价值偏好对应于从最可能的响应向LLM中代表的理想价值的转变。实际上，即便是通过上下文提示学习到的新实体，这种效果也能够再现。我们表明这种偏差表现在意想不到的地方，并对选择典型实例等相关应用场景产生影响。结果显示，价值偏好在不同分类的LLMs中都很明显。",
