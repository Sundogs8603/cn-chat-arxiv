    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.18923v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Dysarthria, a common issue among stroke patients, severely impacts speech intelligibility. Inappropriate pauses are crucial indicators in severity assessment and speech-language therapy. We propose to extend a large-scale speech recognition model for inappropriate pause detection in dysarthric speech. To this end, we propose task design, labeling strategy, and a speech recognition model with an inappropriate pause prediction layer. First, we treat pause detection as speech recognition, using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model to convert speech into text with pause tags. According to the newly designed task, we label pause locations at the text level and their appropriateness. We collaborate with speech-language pathologists to establish labeling criteria, ensuring high-quality annotated data. Finally, we extend the ASR model with an inappropriate pause prediction layer for end-to-end inappropriate pause detection. Moreover, we p",

    "translated_abstract": "发音障碍是中风患者常见问题，严重影响语音可懂性。不当停顿在病情评估和语言治疗中是关键指标。我们提出使用大规模语音识别模型来检测发音障碍语音中的不当停顿。为此，我们提出了任务设计、标注策略和一个带有不当停顿预测层的语音识别模型。首先，我们将停顿检测视为语音识别，使用自动语音识别（ASR）模型将语音转换为带有停顿标记的文本。根据设计的新任务，在文本级别标出停顿位置及其是否适当。我们与言语病理学家合作制定标注标准，确保高质量的带标注数据。最后，我们通过添加一个不当停顿预测层扩展了ASR模型，实现端到端的不当停顿检测。",
