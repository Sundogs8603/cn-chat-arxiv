We investigate the interpretability of our proposed biomarker-based lung ultrasound diagnostic pipeline to enhance clinicians' diagnostic capabilities. The objective of this study is to assess whether explanations from a decision tree classifier, utilizing biomarkers, can improve users' ability to identify inaccurate model predictions compared to conventional saliency maps. Our findings demonstrate that decision tree explanations, based on clinically established biomarkers, can assist clinicians in detecting false positives, thus improving the reliability of diagnostic models in medicine.",
