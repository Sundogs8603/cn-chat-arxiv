A unique few-shot prompting method enhances the models' ability to analyze and explain depressive symptoms based on the DSM-5 criteria. In the interaction phase, the models engage in empathetic dialogue management, drawing from resources like PsychDB and a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Guide, fostering supportive interactions with individuals experiencing major depressive disorders. Additionally, the research introduces the Illuminate Database, enriched with various CBT modules, aiding in personalized therapy recommendations.

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种使用先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）：Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4（GPT-4）、Llama 2 chat和Gemini的抑郁症检测和治疗新范式。这些LLMs通过特定的提示进行微调，以诊断、解释和建议抑郁症的治疗干预。一种独特的少样本提示方法增强了模型根据DSM-5标准分析和解释抑郁症状的能力。在交互阶段，模型采用共情对话管理，利用PsychDB和认知行为疗法（CBT）指南等资源，与患有重度抑郁症的个体进行支持性互动。此外，研究还介绍了Illuminate数据库，其中包含各种CBT模块，可帮助个性化的治疗建议。该研究使用F1分数、精确度、召回率、余弦相似度和召回率导向的差错进行LLM性能评估。",
