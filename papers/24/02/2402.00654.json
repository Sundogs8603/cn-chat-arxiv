    "abstract": "The US Census Bureau has collected two rounds of experimental data from the Commodity Flow Survey, providing shipment-level characteristics of nationwide commodity movements, published in 2012 (i.e., Public Use Microdata) and in 2017 (i.e., Public Use File).

In this study, we used the 2017 Commodity Flow Survey Public Use File data set to explore building a high-performance freight mode choice model, considering three main improvements: (1) constructing local models for each separate commodity/industry category; (2) extracting useful geographical features, particularly the derived distance of each freight mode between origin/destination zones; and (3) applying additional ensemble learning methods such as stacking or voting to combine results from local and unified models for improved performance.

    "translated_abstract": "美国人口普查局收集了两轮实验数据，提供了全国商品流动的运输特征，分别在2012年（即公共使用微数据）和2017年（即公共使用文件）发布。基于这些信息，数据驱动方法在理解货运物流的详细模式方面变得越来越有价值。在本研究中，我们使用2017年的商品流动调查公共使用文件数据集，探索构建一个高性能的货运模式选择模型，考虑到三个主要改进：（1）为每个独立的商品/行业类别构建本地模型；（2）提取有用的地理特征，尤其是每种货运模式在起点/终点区域之间的衍生距离；（3）利用集成学习方法，如堆叠或投票，将本地和统一模型的结果相结合，以提高性能。所提出的方法在没有内存限制的情况下实现了超过92%的准确性。",
