    "translated_abstract": "图的常见分割方法是最小割。经典最小割方法的一个缺点是它们倾向于生成小的分组，这就是为什么更平衡的变体，如归一化割和比例割取得了更多的成功。然而，我们认为对于某些应用，如非平衡数据集的聚类，这些变体的平衡约束可能过于限制，而对于寻找完美平衡分区来说不够限制。在这里，我们提出了一种新的图割算法，用于在任意大小约束下对图进行分割。我们将图割问题制定为正则化的Gromov-Wasserstein问题。然后，我们提出使用加速的近端GD算法来解决它，该算法具有全局收敛性保证，产生稀疏解，并且只比经典谱聚类算法多消耗$\\mathcal{O}(\\log(n))$的附加比率，但效率更高。",
