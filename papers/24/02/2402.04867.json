    "translated_abstract": "在信息检索的快速发展环境中，搜索引擎致力于为用户提供更个性化和相关性更强的结果。查询建议系统在实现这一目标方面起着重要作用，通过协助用户制定有效的查询。然而，现有的查询建议系统主要依赖于文本输入，可能限制用户对图像查询的体验。本文提出了一种新颖的多模态查询建议（MMQS）任务，旨在基于用户查询图像生成查询建议，以提高搜索结果的意图性和多样性。我们提出了RL4Sugg框架，利用大型语言模型（LLM）和多智能体强化学习与人类反馈的力量来优化生成过程。通过全面的实验，我们验证了RL4Sugg的有效性，与最佳现有方法相比，获得了18%的改进。此外，MMQS已经在实际环境中得到了应用。",
