    "translated_abstract": "在电力系统领域，住宅用户在负荷预测应用中的日益增加使得数据隐私问题日趋关注。具体而言，负荷数据可能意外地泄露住宅用户的日常生活习惯，从而对其财产安全构成风险。虽然联邦学习（FL）已被用来通过在不交换原始数据的情况下进行模型训练来保护用户隐私，但这些FL模型对新兴的攻击技术（如梯度泄漏攻击和毒化攻击）显示出了脆弱性。为了抵御这些攻击，我们首先采用了一种安全聚合（SecAgg）算法，利用多方计算密码学技术来减轻梯度泄漏的风险。然而，SecAgg的引入需要部署额外的子中心服务器来执行多方计算协议，从而增加了计算复杂度，降低了系统的鲁棒性，特别是在特定场景中。",
