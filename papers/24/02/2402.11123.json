    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11123v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Warfarin, an anticoagulant medication, is formulated to prevent and address conditions associated with abnormal blood clotting, making it one of the most prescribed drugs globally. However, determining the suitable dosage remains challenging due to individual response variations, and prescribing an incorrect dosage may lead to severe consequences. Contextual bandit and reinforcement learning have shown promise in addressing this issue. Given the wide availability of observational data and safety concerns of decision-making in healthcare, we focused on using exclusively observational data from historical policies as demonstrations to derive new policies; we utilized offline policy learning and evaluation in a contextual bandit setting to establish the optimal personalized dosage strategy. Our learned policies surpassed these baseline approaches without genotype inputs, even when given a suboptimal demonstration, showcasing promising app",

    "translated_abstract": "华法林是一种抗凝药物，旨在预防和治疗与异常血液凝结相关的疾病，是全球最常开处方的药物之一。然而，由于个体反应变化，确定合适的剂量仍具挑战性，错误的剂量可能导致严重后果。情境臂和强化学习在解决这一问题上显示出了潜力。鉴于历史政策的观察数据广泛可得且医疗决策的安全性，我们专注于使用历史政策作为演示的观测数据，通过离线策略学习和评估在情境臂环境中建立最佳个性化剂量策略。我们学习到的策略在没有基因型信息的情况下超越了这些基线方法，甚至在给定次优演示的情况下也表现出色，展示了巨大的应用潜力。",
