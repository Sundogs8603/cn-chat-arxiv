    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新颖的分布式马尔可夫链蒙特卡罗（MCMC）推理方法，用于贝叶斯非参数潜在分块模型（DisNPLBM），采用Master/Worker架构。我们的非参数共聚类算法使用潜在多元高斯块分布将观测值和特征划分为分区。行上的工作负载均匀分布在工人之间，他们只与主节点进行通信，而不与彼此通信。通过实验结果，DisNPLBM证明了其对聚类标签准确性和执行时间的影响。此外，我们还通过将我们的方法应用于共同聚类基因表达数据来展示一个真实的用例。代码源可公开访问https://github.com/redakhoufache/Distributed-NPLBM。",
