    "translated_abstract": "5G规范承诺提供一个通用且灵活的网络基础设施，能够满足当前和未来各种用例的不同需求。5G标准化的两种服务类型是没有严格延迟保证的eMBB和具有严格延迟保证的URLLC。我们关注一种数据时效性是相关质量参数的用例。我们从服务提供商和运营商（SP）获利的角度提供了支持基于数据的服务的经济基础理论。具体而言，我们关注与信息时代有关的数据服务的质量，并通过5G网络评估了两种支持这种服务的替代方案：基于eMBB服务类型和基于URLLC服务类型。这种评估是在垄断市场中进行的。我们得出结论，URLLC支持为SP提供了与竞争对手SP相比的竞争优势。",
