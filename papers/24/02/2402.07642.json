    "abstract": "Safety is of utmost importance for perception in automated driving (AD). However, a prime safety concern in state-of-the art object detection is that standard evaluation schemes utilize safety-agnostic metrics to argue sufficient detection performance. Hence, it is imperative to leverage supplementary domain knowledge to accentuate safety-critical misdetections during evaluation tasks. To tackle the underspecification, this paper introduces a novel credibility metric, called c-flow, for pedestrian bounding boxes. To this end, c-flow relies on a complementary optical flow signal from image sequences and enhances the analyses of safety-critical misdetections without requiring additional labels. We implement and evaluate c-flow with a state-of-the-art pedestrian detector on a large AD dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that c-flow allows developers to identify safety-critical misdetections.",

    "translated_abstract": "安全是自动驾驶中感知的最重要方面。然而，目前的物体检测的主要安全问题是标准评估方案使用不关注安全的度量来证明足够的检测性能。因此，必须利用补充领域知识来突出评估任务中的安全关键的误检。为了解决这个问题，本文引入了一种新颖的可信度度量，称为c-flow，用于行人边界框。为此，c-flow利用图像序列中的补充光流信号，并增强了对安全关键的误检的分析，而无需额外的标签。我们在一个大型自动驾驶数据集上实现和评估了c-flow与一种先进的行人检测器。我们的分析证明，c-flow可以帮助开发人员识别安全关键的误检。",
