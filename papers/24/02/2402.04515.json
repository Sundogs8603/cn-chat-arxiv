    "translated_abstract": "下一代网络需要在管理方面进行重大改进，以实现自动化并根据流量动态调整网络配置。软件定义网络（SDN）和可编程交换机的出现使得网络具备了灵活性和可编程性。然而，传统的决策流量策略的技术通常基于手工优化和启发式算法。这些技术尽管为下一代网络提供了可行的解决方案，却基于不现实的假设，例如静态网络负载和拓扑结构。本文中，我们设计和开发了一种深度强化学习（DRL）方法来实现自适应交通路由。我们设计了一个深度图卷积神经网络（DGCNN），并将其集成到DRL框架中，以从网络拓扑和链路节点属性中学习流量行为。我们采用深度Q学习技术，在DRL框架中训练DGCNN模型，无需手工编程优化。",
