    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了两个玩家，分别代表Alice和Bob，通过对蛋糕的个人估值进行了重复的公平分割。在每一轮中，会出现一块与之前轮次相同的新蛋糕。Alice在自己选择的一个点上切割蛋糕，而Bob选择左边的部分或右边的部分，把剩余的给Alice。我们考虑了两个变种：顺序模式，Bob在选择左/右之前观察Alice的切割点；同时模式，他只在做出选择后观察她的切割点。同时模式是由Aumann和Maschler（1995）首次提出的。我们发现，如果Bob几乎是目光短浅的，并且经常选择自己喜欢的部分，那么他可以被Alice通过类似于二分查找的策略系统性地利用。这个策略使得Alice可以越来越精确地模拟Bob的偏好，从而在时间上获得不成比例的资源份额。我们分析了一个玩家能够利用其优势的极限。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文研究了重复公平分割问题中的竞争策略，发现如果Bob过于偏好某一块蛋糕，Alice利用类似于二分查找的策略可以系统性地对Bob实施剥削，从而在时间上获得更多资源份额。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates competition strategies in repeated fair division problems and discovers that Alice can systematically exploit Bob by using a strategy similar to binary search if Bob shows a strong preference for a specific piece of cake, thus securing a greater share of the resources over time."
