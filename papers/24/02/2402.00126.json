    "translated_abstract": "最先进的方法依赖于通过神经网络提取的基于图像的特征进行深度伪造检测二分类。虽然这些方法在监督训练下提取了可能的伪造特征，但它们可能无法有效表示不自然的“非物理”语义面部属性 - 模糊的发际线、双眉毛、僵硬的瞳孔或不自然的皮肤着色。然而，这类面部属性通常通过常识推理对人类来说很容易感知。此外，通过显著性图提供视觉解释的基于图像的特征提取方法可能很难被人类解释。为了解决这些挑战，我们建议使用常识推理来建模深度伪造检测，并将其扩展到Deepfake Detection VQA（DD-VQA）任务，目的是模拟人类直觉来解释标记图像为真实或伪造的原因。为此，我们引入了一个新的数据集，为与深度伪造检测相关的问题提供答案。",
