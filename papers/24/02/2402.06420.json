    "title": "Findings of the First Workshop on Simulating Conversational Intelligence in Chat",
    "abstract": "The aim of this workshop is to bring together experts working on open-domain dialogue research. In this speedily advancing research area many challenges still exist, such as learning information from conversations, engaging in realistic and convincing simulation of human intelligence and reasoning. SCI-CHAT follows previous workshops on open domain dialogue but with a focus on the simulation of intelligent conversation as judged in a live human evaluation. Models aim to include the ability to follow a challenging topic over a multi-turn conversation, while positing, refuting and reasoning over arguments. The workshop included both a research track and shared task. The main goal of this paper is to provide an overview of the shared task and a link to an additional paper that will include an in depth analysis of the shared task results following presentation at the workshop.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研讨会旨在汇集从事开放领域对话研究的专家。在这个快速发展的研究领域中仍然存在许多挑战，如从对话中学习信息、进行真实和令人信服的人工智能和推理模拟。SCI-CHAT是之前关于开放领域对话的研讨会的延续，但着重于模拟智能对话，并通过人类评估来判断其质量。模型的目标是在多轮对话中能够跟随一个具有挑战性的主题，同时提出、反驳和推理论证。该研讨会包括研究路径和共享任务。本文的主要目标是概述共享任务，并提供一个链接，链接将包含在研讨会上展示后对共享任务结果进行深入分析的另一篇论文。",
