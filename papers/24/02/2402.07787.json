    "translated_abstract": "基于方面的情感分析（ABSA）评估文本中的情感表达以理解情感信息。先前的研究整合了外部知识，如知识图谱，以加强ABSA模型中的语义特征。最近的研究探讨了在依赖和组成树上使用图神经网络（GNN）进行句法分析。随着ABSA的不断发展，越来越多的创新的语言和结构特征被融入其中（例如潜在图），但这也引入了复杂性和混淆。目前，尚不存在一个可扩展的框架，可以将多样性的语言和结构特征集成到ABSA中。本文介绍了可扩展的多粒度融合（EMGF）网络，它整合了来自句法依赖和组成、注意力语义和外部知识图谱的信息。EMGF配备了多锚点三元学习和正交投影，高效地利用了这些特征的综合潜力。",
