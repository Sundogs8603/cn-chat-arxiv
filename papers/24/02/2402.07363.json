    "translated_abstract": "在游戏理论和机器学习的交界处，学习在重复的一价拍卖中进行竞标是一个基本问题，由于显示广告转向一价拍卖，最近受到了广泛关注。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新颖的凹函数形式，用于一价拍卖中纯策略的竞标，并将其用于分析这个问题的自然梯度上升算法。重要的是，我们的分析超越了过去工作的差距，还考虑了在线广告市场的战略背景，其中部署了竞标算法 - 我们证明了我们的算法不会被策略性卖家利用，并且它们激励买家诚实交易。具体而言，我们证明了当最高竞争出价通过对抗方式生成时，我们的算法达到了$O(\\sqrt{T})$的后悔，并表明没有更好的在线算法可以做得更好。进一步证明了当最高竞争出价通过对抗方式生成时，我们的算法达到了$O(\\log T)$的后悔。",
