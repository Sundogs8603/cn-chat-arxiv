This paper introduces BioT5+, an extension of the BioT5 framework, tailored to enhance biological research and drug discovery. BioT5+ incorporates several novel features: integration of IUPAC names for molecular understanding, inclusion of extensive bio-text and molecule data from sources like bioRxiv and PubChem, the multi-task instruction tuning for generality across tasks, and a novel numerical tokenization technique for improved processing of numerical data.

    "translated_abstract": "最近计算生物学的研究趋势越来越集中于整合文本和生物实体建模，特别是在分子和蛋白质的背景下。然而，类似于BioT5的先前工作在跨越多样化任务和缺乏对分子结构的细致理解方面面临挑战，特别是在它们的文本表示（例如IUPAC）方面。本文介绍了BioT5+，这是BioT5框架的一个扩展，旨在增强生物研究和药物发现。 BioT5+包含几个新颖的特性：整合IUPAC名称以加深对分子的理解，包括来自bioRxiv和PubChem等源的广泛生物文本和分子数据，多任务指令调整以跨越多个任务，以及一种用于改进数字数据处理的新颖数值标记技术。 这些增强功能使BioT5+能够弥合分子表示和它们的文本之间的差距。",
