    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.18120v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Prior research in representation engineering has revealed that LLMs encode concepts within their representation spaces, predominantly centered around English. In this study, we extend this philosophy to a multilingual scenario, delving into multilingual human value concepts in LLMs. Through our comprehensive exploration covering 7 types of human values, 16 languages and 3 LLM series with distinct multilinguality, we empirically substantiate the existence of multilingual human values in LLMs. Further cross-lingual analysis on these concepts discloses 3 traits arising from language resource disparities: cross-lingual inconsistency, distorted linguistic relationships, and unidirectional cross-lingual transfer between high- and low-resource languages, all in terms of human value concepts. Additionally, we validate the feasibility of cross-lingual control over value alignment capabilities of LLMs, leveraging the dominant language as a source ",

    "translated_abstract": "先前在表示工程领域的研究揭示了LLMs在其表示空间中编码概念，主要围绕英语展开。在这项研究中，我们将这一理念扩展到多语境场景，深入探讨LLMs中的多语言人类价值概念。通过我们对7种人类价值、16种语言以及3个具有明显多语特性的LLM系列进行的全面探索，我们从实证角度证实了LLMs中存在多语言人类价值观念。对这些概念的跨语言分析进一步揭示了由于语言资源差异而产生的3个特征：跨语言不一致性、扭曲的语言关系以及高资源语言和低资源语言之间在人类价值概念方面的单向跨语言转移。此外，我们验证了通过利用主导语言作为信息源实现对LLMs价值观齐整性的跨语言控制的可行性。",
