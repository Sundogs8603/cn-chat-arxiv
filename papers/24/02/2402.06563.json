    "abstract": "Electronic patient records (EPRs) produce a wealth of data but contain significant missing information. Understanding and handling this missing data is an important part of clinical data analysis and if left unaddressed could result in bias in analysis and distortion in critical conclusions. Missing data may be linked to health care professional practice patterns and imputation of missing data can increase the validity of clinical decisions. This study focuses on statistical approaches for understanding and interpreting the missing data and machine learning based clinical data imputation using a single centre's paediatric emergency data and the data from UK's largest clinical audit for traumatic injury database (TARN). In the study of 56,961 data points related to initial vital signs and observations taken on children presenting to an Emergency Department, we have shown that missing data are likely to be non-random and how these are linked to health care professional practice patterns.",

    "translated_abstract": "电子病人记录（EPR）产生了大量数据，但其中包含重要的缺失信息。理解和处理这些缺失数据是临床数据分析的重要组成部分，如果不加以解决，可能导致分析中的偏见和关键结论的扭曲。缺失数据可能与医疗专业人士的实践模式有关，对缺失数据的插补可以提高临床决策的有效性。本研究专注于统计方法来理解和解释缺失数据，并使用单一中心的儿科急诊数据以及英国最大的创伤伤害数据库（TARN）中的数据，进行基于机器学习的临床数据插补。在对56,961个与儿童急诊部就诊相关的初步生命体征和观察数据进行的研究中，我们表明丢失数据很可能是非随机的，并展示了这些数据与医疗专业人士的实践模式的关联。",
    "tldr": "本研究使用统计方法和机器学习，通过分析儿科急诊数据和创伤伤害数据库，揭示了医疗实践模式与丢失数据之间的关联，并提出了临床数据插补的方法。这对于减少分析偏见、提高临床决策的有效性非常重要。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study utilizes statistical approaches and machine learning to understand the association between healthcare practice patterns and missing data, and proposes methods for clinical data imputation. It highlights the significance of addressing missing data to reduce analysis bias and improve the effectiveness of clinical decision-making."
