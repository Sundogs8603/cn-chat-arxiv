To circumvent such an independence of decision, while retaining the O(n^2) complexity and highly parallelizable architecture, we propose to use simple auxiliary tasks that introduce some form of interdependence between arcs. Experiments on the three English acyclic datasets of SemEval 2015 task 18 (Oepen et al., 2015), and on French deep syntactic cyclic graphs (Ribeyre et al., 2014) show modest but systematic performance gains on a near state-of-the-art baseline using transformer-based contextualized representations.

    "translated_abstract": "Dozat和Manning (2017)的双线性解析成功地扩展到语义依存解析(SDP) (Dozat和Manning, 2018)。鉴于没有树结构的约束，对于给定的句子，所有弧都是相互独立预测的（除了令牌的共享表示），然而其在图上的性能令人惊讶地很高。为了避免这种决策的独立性，同时保持O(n^2)的复杂度和高度可并行化的架构，我们提出使用简单的辅助任务，引入弧之间某种形式的相互依赖。在SemEval 2015任务18的三个英语非循环数据集(Oepen et al., 2015)和法语深度句法循环图(Ribeyre et al., 2014)上的实验表明，在使用基于Transformer的上下文化表示的接近最先进基线的基础上，虽然性能改进适中但系统性地提高了性能。这提供了一种简单而强大的提升SDP性能的方法。",
