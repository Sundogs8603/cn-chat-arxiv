    "translated_abstract": "市政机构容易受到网络攻击并造成灾难性后果，但缺乏评估自身风险并与同行机构的安全状况进行比较的关键信息。我们利用通过密码计算平台收集的83个市政机构的数据，包括安全状况、安全事件、安全控制失效以及损失，建立基于数据驱动的市政网络风险模型和网络安全基准。我们生成了一个行业中安全状况的基准、网络安全事件的频率、组织根据其防御状况预测的年度损失，以及根据各个控制措施的失效率和相关损失加权。综合这四项指标可以通过量化行业中的网络风险、识别需要解决的差距、优先考虑政策干预，并跟踪这些干预措施的进展来指导网络政策制定。对于市政机构来说，这些新的指标可以帮助他们评估自身网络风险并制定相应的改进措施。",
