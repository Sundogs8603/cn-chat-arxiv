    "translated_abstract": "风险缓解技术对避免与驾驶行为相关的事故至关重要。我们提供了一种独创的多类驾驶员分心风险评估（MDDRA）模型，在旅程中考虑了车辆、驾驶员和环境数据。MDDRA将驾驶员在风险矩阵中分类为安全、粗心或危险，可灵活调整参数和权重以考虑每个事件在特定严重级别上的情况。我们使用Field Operation Test（TeleFOT）收集了在英国东米德兰地区使用相同路线的驾驶员的真实世界数据。结果显示减少由驾驶员分心引起的道路事故是可能的。我们还研究了分心（驾驶员、车辆和环境）与基于持续分心严重得分的分类严重程度之间的相关性。此外，我们应用机器学习技术对驾驶员分心进行分类和预测。",
