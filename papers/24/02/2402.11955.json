The study evaluates SEASON's efficacy by comparing it with prominent models like BART, PEGASUS, and ProphetNet, all fine-tuned for various text summarization tasks. The assessment is conducted using diverse datasets including CNN/Dailymail, SAMSum, and Financial-news based Event-Driven Trading (EDT), with a specific focus on a financial dataset containing a substantial volume of news articles from 2020/03/01 to 2021/05/06. This paper employs various evaluation metrics such as ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore, and MoverScore to evaluate the performance of these models fine-tuned for generating abstractive summaries.
