    "translated_abstract": "近年来，深度学习在药物发现中被广泛应用于分子生成。在该领域中，Transformer和VAE被广泛使用作为强大的模型，但由于它们之间的结构和性能不匹配，很少组合使用。本研究通过处理多样化分子的结构和参数优化，提出了将这两种模型结合的模型。所提出的模型在生成分子方面表现出与现有模型相媲美的性能，并在生成具有未知结构的分子方面表现出迄今为止卓越的性能。此外，所提出的模型成功利用了VAE的潜在表示来预测分子性质。消融研究表明，在生成新颖分子方面，VAE比语言模型等其他生成模型具有优势，并且分子可以用约32个维度变量来描述，比现有描述符和模型要小得多。",
