FedKit pipelines cross-platform FL development by enabling model conversion, hardware-accelerated training, and cross-platform model aggregation. Our FL workflow supports flexible machine learning operations (MLOps) in production, facilitating continuous model delivery and training. We have deployed FedKit in a real-world use case for health data analysis on university campuses, demonstrating its effectiveness. FedKit is open-source at https://github.com/FedCampus/FedKit.",
