    "translated_abstract": "空气污染在全球范围内代表了一个关键的环境挑战，通过温室气体排放在气候变化中起着重要作用，并对全球数十亿人的健康产生负面影响。然而，预测污染物的空间和时间分布仍然具有挑战性。地面监测设施的稀缺以及空气污染建模对全面数据集的依赖性（这些数据集通常对许多地区不可获取）使得问题复杂化。在这项工作中，我们介绍了GeoFormer，这是一种结合了视觉Transformer模块和高效的时间序列Transformer模块的紧凑模型，可从Sentinel-5P卫星图像中预测地表二氧化氮（NO2）浓度。我们使用由Sentinel-5P图像和相应的NO2浓度读数构建的数据集，训练了提出的模型以预测地表NO2浓度测量值。该模型具有较高的准确性（MAE 5.65），证明了其有效性。",
