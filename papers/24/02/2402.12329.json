    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究表明，可以构造对抗性示例，导致一个对其进行了调整的语言模型产生有害字符串或执行有害行为。现有的攻击要么在白盒设置中（完全访问模型权重），要么通过可转移性：一种现象，即在一个模型上精心设计的对抗性示例通常在其他模型上仍然有效。我们通过基于查询的攻击改进以前的工作，利用 API 访问远程语言模型来构造对抗性示例，使模型以（明显）更高的概率发出有害字符串，而不能仅仅使用转移攻击。我们在 GPT-3.5 和 OpenAI 的安全分类器上验证了我们的攻击；我们能够让 GPT-3.5 发出有害字符串，而目前的转移攻击失败了，并且我们几乎以 100% 的概率规避了安全分类器。",
