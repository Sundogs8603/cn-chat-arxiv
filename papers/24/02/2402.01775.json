    "translated_abstract": "经典Delphi和模糊Delphi方法用于测试诸如问卷之类的数据收集工具的内容有效性。模糊Delphi从语言角度出发，通过使用模糊数字来减少意见中的歧义。我们提出了一种名为2-Tuple模糊语言Delphi方法的扩展，以处理评委显示不同的专业程度的情况，通过使用语言术语的模糊多粒度语义来获得中间和最终结果，结果用2-Tuple语言值表示。我们提案的关键思想是通过评估其部分来验证完整的问卷，将每个项目的有效性定义为一个决策问题。通过考虑专家的意见，我们测量一致性程度，一致性程度和每个项目的语言得分，以便检测影响仪器质量的项目，无论是积极的还是消极的。考虑到评价b-学习的实际需求。",
