    "translated_abstract": "受控微分方程（CDE）的矢量场描述了控制路径与解路径演化之间的关系。神经CDE（NCDE）将时间序列数据视为对控制路径的观测，使用神经网络对CDE的矢量场进行参数化，并将解路径作为持续演化的隐藏状态。由于其构造使其能够抵抗不规则采样率，NCDE是建模现实世界数据的强大方法。在神经粗糙微分方程（NRDE）的基础上，我们引入了Log-NCDE，这是一种训练NCDE的新颖且有效的方法。Log-NCDE的核心组件是Log-ODE方法，这是从粗糙路径研究中的一种用于近似CDE解的工具。在一系列多变量时间序列分类基准上，展示了Log-NCDE比NCDE，NRDE和两种最先进模型S5和线性递归模型具有更高的平均测试集准确率。",
