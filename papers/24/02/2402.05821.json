    "translated_abstract": "如何自动设计更好的机器学习程序是AutoML中的一个开放问题。尽管进化算法已经成为搜索更好的机器学习程序的常用工具，但是在复杂问题上使用学习本身来引导搜索的方法成功较少且理解较少，但有着显著提高优化过程的速度和最终性能的潜力。我们提出使用一个二元判别器来引导进化，该判别器在线训练，通过区分给定一对程序中哪个更好来选择更好的程序。判别器在不进行昂贵的评估的情况下选择更好的程序，从而加速进化的收敛过程。我们的方法可以编码各种机器学习组件，包括符号优化器、神经网络架构、强化学习损失函数和符号回归方程，它们都使用同样的有向无环图表示。通过将这种表示与现代图神经网络和自适应变异策略相结合，我们展示了我们的方法可以加速进化的过程。",
