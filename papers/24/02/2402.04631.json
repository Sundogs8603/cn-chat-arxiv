    "translated_abstract": "說服是人类交流中至关重要的能力之一，在智能对话系统领域，研究人员对此给予了广泛的关注。我们人类往往通过对话的方式来说服他人改变他们的观点、态度或行为，这在各种情景下都是如此（例如推动社会福利、在在线平台上争论）。开发能够说服他人接受某些立场的对话机器人对于实现真正智能和具有人类特点的对话系统至关重要。由于大型语言模型（LLM）的显著进展，对话机器人已经获得了在上下文理解和回应生成方面的卓越能力。然而，作为一个典型且复杂的认知心理系统，说服对话机器人还需要获得来自认知心理学领域的知识，以达到人类般的说服水平。因此，认知策略增强的说服对话机器人（定义为CogAgent）",
    "tldr": "该论文讨论了认知策略增强的说服对话机器人的未来发展，强调了对于实现智能和人类化对话系统的重要性。该领域的研究者通过利用大型语言模型的进展，使对话机器人在上下文理解和回应生成方面取得了巨大进步。然而，要实现人类般的说服水平，说服对话机器人需要融入认知心理学的知识。",

Researchers in this field have made significant progress in context understanding and response generation by leveraging advancements in large language models. However, to achieve human-like persuasion, persuasive dialogue agents need to incorporate knowledge from the field of cognitive psychology."
