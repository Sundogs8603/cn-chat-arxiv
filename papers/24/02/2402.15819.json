    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.15819v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Existing model-based interactive recommendation systems are trained by querying a world model to capture the user preference, but learning the world model from historical logged data will easily suffer from bias issues such as popularity bias and sampling bias. This is why some debiased methods have been proposed recently. However, two essential drawbacks still remain: 1) ignoring the dynamics of the time-varying popularity results in a false reweighting of items. 2) taking the unknown samples as negative samples in negative sampling results in the sampling bias. To overcome these two drawbacks, we develop a model called \\textbf{i}dentifiable \\textbf{D}ebiased \\textbf{M}odel-based \\textbf{I}nteractive \\textbf{R}ecommendation (\\textbf{iDMIR} in short). In iDMIR, for the first drawback, we devise a debiased causal world model based on the causal mechanism of the time-varying recommendation generation process with identification guarantee",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的基于模型的交互式推荐系统通过查询世界模型来捕捉用户偏好，但从历史记录数据中学习世界模型很容易受到偏见问题的困扰，如流行度偏见和抽样偏见。最近提出了一些消除偏见的方法。然而，仍然存在两个主要缺点：1）忽略时间变化流行度的动态会导致对项目的错误重新加权。 2）将未知样本视为负样本在负采样中会导致抽样偏见。为了克服这两个缺点，我们开发了一种称为可识别去偏见模型的交互式推荐模型（简称iDMIR）。在iDMIR中，针对第一个缺点，我们设计了一个基于因果机制的偏见消除因果世界模型，保证了鉴别性。",
