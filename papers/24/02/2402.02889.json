    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）和自监督学习（SSL）的整合为利用音频数据进行通用音频理解提供了独特而协同的组合，而不会损害用户数据隐私。然而，目前很少有研究探讨在大规模异构音频源生成的非独立同分布（non-iid）数据情况下，SSL模型在FL模式下用于通用音频理解的性能。本文在仿真非独立同分布数据的大规模FL设置中评估了特征匹配和预测音频-SSL技术的性能。我们提出了一种新颖的Federated SSL（F-SSL）框架，名为FASSL，可以从大规模分散的异构客户端学习中间特征表示，存储未标记的音频数据。我们的研究发现，在音频检索任务中，音频F-SSL方法与集中式音频-SSL方法的性能不相上下。",
