    "translated_abstract": "机器人采摘有潜力对农业生产力产生积极影响，降低成本，改善食品质量，提高可持续性，并解决劳动力短缺问题。在农业机器人领域飞速发展的情况下，在虚拟环境中训练机器人已成为必要。生成训练数据以自动化底层计算机视觉任务（如图像分割、目标检测和分类）也严重依赖于这些虚拟环境，因为往往需要合成数据来克服真实数据集的短缺和缺乏多样性。然而，常用的物理引擎如ODE、Simbody、Bullet和DART在机器人领域主要支持刚体的运动和碰撞交互，这个固有的限制阻碍了对非刚性物体（如植物和作物）的处理实验和进展。在本文中，我们提出了一个基于Cosserat杆的Gazebo仿真平台插件。",
