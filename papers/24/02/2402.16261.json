However, most previous work trained independent retrievers for each specific resource, resulting in sub-optimal performance and low efficiency. Thus, we propose a multi-task framework function as a universal retriever for three dominant retrieval tasks during the conversation: persona selection, knowledge selection, and response selection. To this end, we design a dual-encoder architecture consisting of a context-adaptive dialogue encoder and a candidate encoder, aiming to attention to the relevant context from the long dialogue and retrieve suitable candidates by simply a dot product.

    "translated_abstract": "对话检索是指以迭代和交互方式运行的信息检索系统，需要检索各种外部资源（如人设、知识甚至回应）以有效与用户交互并成功完成对话。为了提高效率和性能，我们提出了一个多任务框架，作为三个主要检索任务的通用检索器：人设选择、知识选择和回应选择。为此，我们设计了一个双编码器架构，包括一个情境自适应对话编码器和一个候选者编码器，旨在通过简单的点积关注长对话中的相关上下文并检索合适的候选者。此外，我们引入了两个损失约束以捕捉...",
