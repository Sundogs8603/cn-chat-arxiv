    "translated_abstract": "机器学习在医疗数据分析方面展现出巨大潜力。来自不同源头和环境的大型数据集对于医疗保健领域的机器学习模型实现更高的准确性和泛化能力至关重要。由于复杂且多变的隐私和监管要求，跨不同医疗机构共享数据是具有挑战性的。因此，允许多个方参与合作训练机器学习模型，在不直接共享数据集或通过合作损害数据集隐私的情况下利用各方现有的私有数据集具有困难但至关重要。在本文中，我们通过提出用于多医院数据的分散、协作和保护隐私的机器学习方法（DeCaPH）来解决这个问题。它具有以下关键优点：（1）允许不同方在不传输私有数据集的情况下协作训练机器学习模型；（2）通过限制潜在的数据泄露和隐私侵犯来保护患者隐私。",
