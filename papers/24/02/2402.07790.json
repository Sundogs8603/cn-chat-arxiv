In our study, we analyze the sensitivity of various calibration measures to score distortions and introduce a refined metric, the Local Calibration Score. Comparing recalibration methods, we advocate for local regressions, emphasizing their dual role as effective recalibration tools and facilitators of smoother visualizations. We apply these findings in a real-world scenario using Random Forest classifier and regressor to predict credit default while simultaneously measuring calibration during performance optimization.",

    "translated_abstract": "传统上，对二元分类器性能的评估主要集中在准确性等度量上。然而，这些度量常常忽视了模型的固有不确定性，尤其是在涉及敏感决策领域（如金融或医疗保健）时。鉴于模型预测的分数通常被视为事件概率，校准对于准确解释是至关重要的。在我们的研究中，我们分析了各种校准度量对分数失真的敏感性，并引入了一种改进的度量，局部校准分数。通过比较重新校准方法，我们倡导使用局部回归，强调其作为有效重新校准工具和更平滑可视化的双重作用。我们应用这些发现在一个真实场景中，使用随机森林分类器和回归器预测信用违约，并同时测量校准性能优化过程中的校准情况。",
