Our discussion highlights challenges in the early stages of GenAI integration, particularly around factual inconsistencies and biases. We discuss how output from GenAI carries an unwarranted sense of credibility, while decreasing transparency and sourcing ability. Furthermore, search engines are already answering queries with error-laden, generated content, further blurring the provenance of information and impacting the integrity of the information ecosystem. We argue how all these factors could reduce the reliability of search engines. Finally, we summarize some of the active research directions and open questions.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇评论中，我们讨论了搜索引擎的发展性质，因为它们开始生成、索引和分发由生成式人工智能（GenAI）创建的内容。我们的讨论突出了在GenAI整合的早期阶段面临的挑战，特别是围绕事实上的不一致性和偏见。我们讨论了GenAI产生的输出带来了无端的可信度，并降低了透明度和信息来源的能力。此外，搜索引擎已经用含有错误的生成内容回答查询，进一步模糊了信息来源，影响了信息生态系统的完整性。我们认为所有这些因素可能降低搜索引擎的可靠性。最后，我们总结了一些活跃的研究方向和未解问题。",
