    "translated_abstract": "回归分析是统计建模中的一个核心主题，旨在估计因变量（通常称为响应变量）与一个或多个自变量（即解释变量）之间的关系。线性回归是迄今为止在预测、预测或因果推断等多个研究领域执行此任务的最流行方法。除了解决线性回归问题的各种传统方法外，如普通最小二乘法、岭回归或套索回归——这些方法往往是更高级机器学习（ML）技术的基础——后者已成功地应用在这种场景中，但没有对统计显著性进行正式定义。最多，基于经验测量（如残差或准确度）进行置换或基于经典分析，以反映ML估计对检测的更高能力。本文介绍了一种新的方法，该方法统计无关地评估了线性回归模型，并对ML估计在检测方面的表现进行了评估。",
