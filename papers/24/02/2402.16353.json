    "translated_abstract": "对于当代量子设备的实际约束如何影响量子学习的复杂性存在着相当大的兴趣。对于经典问题——态重构，最近的研究严格刻画了只能同时测量未知态的一个副本的任何协议的复制复杂性，表明这种复杂性在多项式时间内比可以进行完全纠缠测量的情况更糟。虽然我们现在已经比较全面地了解了在近期和容错区域进行此类任务的速率，但目前我们还不太了解其中的景象是什么样的。在这项工作中，我们研究了可以同时对$t$个副本进行测量的自然情境中的态重构。对于足够小的$\\epsilon$，我们证明了对于任意$t \\le d^2$，学习一个未知的$d$维态$\\rho$到跟踪距离$\\epsilon$需要并且足够的拷贝为$\\widetilde{\\Theta}(\\frac{d^3}{\\sqrt{t}\\epsilon^2})$。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates state tomography in the scenario where multiple copies can be measured simultaneously, revealing that to learn an unknown $d$-dimensional state to a trace distance $\\epsilon$, a necessary and sufficient number of copies is $\\widetilde{\\Theta}(\\frac{d^3}{\\sqrt{t}\\epsilon^2})$."
