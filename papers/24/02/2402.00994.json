    "translated_abstract": "全球客户希望在购买前看到衣服是否适合他们。因此，客户本能地更喜欢实体店购物，这样他们可以在购买前试穿产品。但在COVID-19大流行之后，许多商家要么转向在线购物，要么关闭了试衣间，这使购物过程充满了犹豫和怀疑。为了解决购买后可能不适合买家的问题，我们考虑使用新的人工智能技术创建一个在线平台或虚拟试衣间(VFR)，以手机应用程序和部署模型的形式存在，并可以嵌入到任何在线商店中，买家可以在不需要亲自试穿的情况下试穿任意数量的衣服。此外，它将节省大量寻找产品的时间。此外，通过使用一种特殊类型的镜子来应用相同的技术，它还将减少实体店的拥挤和困扰。",
