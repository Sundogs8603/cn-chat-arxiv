The era of digital media has created an explosion of new media sources, driven by the growth of social media platforms.

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了在与环保、社会责任和公司治理（ESG）社交媒体相关的情绪测量方面的挑战。近年来，ESG在重要性上增长，金融部门对其表现出了极大兴趣，并且许多企业的绩效在某种程度上取决于其ESG相关声誉。利用情绪分析来衡量ESG相关声誉已经得到发展，随之而来的是对机器进行此类分析的兴趣。数字媒体时代催生了新媒体来源的爆炸式增长，这得益于社交媒体平台的增长。这种不断增长的数据环境已成为许多领域行为洞察研究的极佳来源，涵盖政治、医疗保健和市场研究。我们的研究旨在比较人类表现与语言模型在衡量ESG相关情绪方面的尖端表现。为此，研究人员对150条推文的情绪进行分类。",
