We aimed to assess whether clinical large language models (LLMs) can predict postoperative risks using clinical texts with various training strategies. The main cohort involved 84,875 records from Barnes Jewish Hospital (BJH) system between 2018 and 2021. Methods were replicated on Beth Israel Deaconess's MIMIC dataset. Both studies had mean duration of follow-up based on the length of postoperative ICU stay less than 7 days. For the BJH dataset, outcomes included 30-day mortality, pulmonary embolism (PE) and pneumonia. Three domain adaptation and finetuning strategies were implemented for BioGPT, ClinicalBERT and BioClinicalBERT: self-supervised objectives; incorporating labels with semi-supervised fine-tuning; and foundational modelling through multi-task learning.
