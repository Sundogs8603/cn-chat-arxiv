    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的普及引发了广泛和普遍的兴趣，因为它们具有强大的语言生成能力，为行业和研究提供了巨大的潜力。尽管以前的研究探讨了LLMs的安全性和隐私问题，但这些模型能否表现出对抗行为的程度仍然尚未完全探索。为了填补这一空白，我们研究常见的公开可用LLMs是否具有能力扰乱文本样本以愚弄安全措施，即所谓的对抗示例或攻击。更具体地说，我们调查LLMs是否本质上能够从良性样本中制造对抗性示例以愚弄现有的安全防线。我们的实验重点关注仇恨言论检测，发现LLMs成功地找到了对抗性扰动，有效地破坏了对仇恨言论检测系统的防御。我们的发现对（半）自动化安全评估和防御具有重要影响。",
