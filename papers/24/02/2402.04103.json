    "translated_abstract": "最近，人们对在线购买的意识显著提高，这导致了在线零售平台的出现，对于客户购买行为的更好理解的需求也因此产生。零售公司面临着处理大量客户购买的压力，这需要更准确和高效的客户分群方法。客户分群是一种市场分析工具，有助于客户中心服务，从而提高盈利能力。本文旨在开发一个客户分群模型，改善零售市场行业的决策过程。为了实现这一目标，我们使用了一个来自UCI机器学习库的基于英国的在线零售数据集。这个零售数据集包含541,909个客户记录和8个特征。我们的研究采用了RFM（最近性、频率和货币）框架来量化客户价值。然后，我们比较了几种最先进的聚类算法（SOTA）。",
