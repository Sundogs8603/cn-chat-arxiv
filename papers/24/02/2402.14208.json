    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言处理（NLP）中，减轻机器学习模型中的偏见引起了越来越多的关注。然而，只有少数研究集中在公平的文本嵌入上，这对实际应用至关重要且具有挑战性。本文提出了一种学习公平文本嵌入的新方法。我们通过确保在内容条件下敏感属性与文本嵌入之间的条件独立性来实现公平性，同时保持效用权衡。具体来说，我们强制要求具有不同敏感属性但相同内容的文本的嵌入与其对应中立文本的嵌入保持相同的距离。此外，我们通过使用大型语言模型（LLMs）将文本增强为不同的敏感组，来解决缺乏适当训练数据的问题。我们广泛的评估表明，我们的方法有效地提高了公平性同时保持了嵌入的效用。",
