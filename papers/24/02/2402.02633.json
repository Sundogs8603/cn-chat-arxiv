    "abstract": "Fine-tuning and testing a multilingual large language model is expensive and challenging for low-resource languages (LRLs). While previous studies have predicted the performance of natural language processing (NLP) tasks using machine learning methods, they primarily focus on high-resource languages, overlooking LRLs and shifts across domains. Focusing on LRLs, we investigate three factors: the size of the fine-tuning corpus, the domain similarity between fine-tuning and testing corpora, and the language similarity between source and target languages. We employ classical regression models to assess how these factors impact the model's performance. Our results indicate that domain similarity has the most critical impact on predicting the performance of Machine Translation models.",

    "translated_abstract": "对于低资源语言（LRLs），细调和测试多语言大型语言模型是昂贵且具有挑战性的。然而，先前的研究主要关注高资源语言，忽视了LRLs和跨领域的转变。针对LRLs，我们研究了三个因素：细调语料库的大小，细调语料库与测试语料库之间的领域相似性，以及源语言和目标语言之间的语言相似性。我们采用经典回归模型评估这些因素对模型性能的影响。我们的结果表明领域相似性对于预测机器翻译模型的性能具有最重要的影响。",
