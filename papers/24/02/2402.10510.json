Current goal recognition algorithms often take only observed actions as input, but here we use a Bayesian framework to explore the role of actions, timing, and goal solvability in goal recognition. We analyze human responses to goal-recognition problems in the Sokoban domain, and find that actions are assigned most importance, but that timing and solvability also influence goal recognition in some cases, especially when actions are uninformative. We leverage these findings to develop a goal recognition model that matches human inferences more closely than do existing algorithms. Our work provides new insight into human goal recognition and takes a step towards more human-like AI models.",

    "translated_abstract": "目标识别是一种基本认知过程，使个体能够根据可用线索推断意图。当前的目标识别算法通常只考虑观察到的行动作为输入，但在这里我们使用贝叶斯框架来探讨行动、时序和目标可解性在目标识别中的作用。我们分析了人类在Sokoban领域中对目标识别问题的响应，发现行动被赋予最重要的作用，但在某些情况下，时序和可解性也影响目标识别，特别是当行动无信息时。我们利用这些发现开发了一个目标识别模型，其与现有算法相比更能匹配人类的推断。我们的工作为人类目标识别提供了新的见解，并迈出了更接近人类的AI模型的一步。",
