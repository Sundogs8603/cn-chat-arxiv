GhostWriter leverages LLMs to learn the user's intended writing style implicitly as they write, while allowing explicit teaching moments through manual style edits and annotations.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在提供不同形式的写作辅助方面越来越流行，并且具有无处不在的应用。然而，由于个性化和控制能力有限，LLM驱动的写作系统可能会使用户感到沮丧，当用户缺乏提示工程经验时，这种情况可能加剧。我们认为设计可以解决这些挑战之一，并引入GhostWriter，这是一个AI增强的写作设计探针，用户可以通过增强的代理和个性化来进行写作。GhostWriter利用LLMs在用户编写的过程中隐式学习用户所期望的写作风格，同时允许通过手动样式编辑和批注进行显式教学。我们研究了18名参与者在两个不同的写作任务中使用GhostWriter，观察到它帮助用户编写个性化的文本生成，并通过提供多种方式控制系统的写作风格来增强用户的能力。从这项研究中，我们提出了一些见解。",
