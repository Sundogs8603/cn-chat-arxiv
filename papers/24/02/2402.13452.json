In this study, we present a new framework to surveil public health, focusing on mental health (MH) outcomes. We hypothesize that locally posted tweets are indicative of local MH outcomes and collect tweets posted from 765 neighborhoods (census block groups) in the USA. We pair these tweets from each neighborhood with the corresponding MH outcome reported by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to create a benchmark dataset, LocalTweets. With LocalTweets, we present the first population-level evaluation task for Twitter-based MH surveillance systems. We then develop an efficient and effective method, LocalHealth, for predicting MH outcomes based on LocalTweets. When used with GPT3.5, LocalHealth achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.7429 and 79.78\\%, respectively, a 59\\% improvement in F",

    "translated_abstract": "先前关于Twitter数据的研究已经提供了它在开发补充健康监测系统方面的实用性证据。在这项研究中，我们提出了一个新的框架来监测公共健康，重点关注精神健康（MH）结果。我们假设当地发布的推文可以表明当地的精神健康结果，并收集了来自美国765个地区（人口普查分组）的推文。我们将每个地区的这些推文与疾病控制中心（CDC）报告的相应MH结果配对，创建了一个基准数据集LocalTweets。借助LocalTweets，我们提出了基于Twitter的MH监测系统的首个人口级评估任务。随后，我们开发了一个高效有效的方法LocalHealth，用于根据LocalTweets预测MH结果。当与GPT3.5一起使用时，LocalHealth实现了最高的F1值和准确率，分别达到0.7429和79.78\\%，F1值提高了59\\%。",
