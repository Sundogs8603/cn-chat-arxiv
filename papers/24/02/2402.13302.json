    "translated_abstract": "目前，用于词义消歧（WSD）的监督模型在最流行的基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。尽管最近引入了词嵌入和循环神经网络以设计强大的上下文相关特征，但利用语义词汇资源（SLRs）改进WSD模型的兴趣主要局限于基于知识的方法。本文通过利用两种流行的SLRs：WordNet和WordNet Domains，增强了“现代”监督WSD模型。我们提出了一种有效的方式将语义特征引入分类器，并考虑使用SLR结构来增强训练数据。我们研究了不同类型的语义特征的作用，探讨它们与通过词嵌入或循环神经网络编码的本地上下文的交互作用，并将所提出的模型扩展为用于WSD的新型多层架构。进行了详细的实验比较。",
