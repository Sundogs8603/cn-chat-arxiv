To address this problem, this paper will provide a new approach by analyzing the EHG signals, which are recorded on the abdomen of the mother during labor and pregnancy. The EHG signal reflects the electrical activity that induces the mechanical contraction of the myometrium. Because EHGs are known to be non-stationary signals, and because we anticipate connectivity to alter during contraction, we applied the windowing approach on real signals to help us identify the best windows and the best nodes with the most significant data to be used for classification. The suggested pipeline includes i) divide the 16 EHG signals that are recorded from the abdomen of pregnant women in N windows; ii) apply the connectivity matrices on each window; iii) apply the Graph theory-based measures on the connectivity matrices on each window; iv) apply t",
