    "translated_abstract": "机器学习技术变得越来越强大，在自然科学领域取得了许多突破，但它们往往是随机的、容易出错的、且黑匣子一般。那么，它们应该如何在理论物理和纯数学等强调严谨和理解的领域中被利用呢？在这个视角中，我们讨论了如何在自然科学中利用机器学习技术取得严谨性。非严谨的方法可能通过猜想生成或通过强化学习进行验证，从而产生严谨的结果。我们调查了这些技术对严谨性的应用，从弦理论到低维拓扑中的平滑$4$d庞加莱猜想。人们还可以想象在机器学习理论与数学或理论物理之间建立直接桥梁。举例来说，我们描述了一个由神经网络理论激发的场论的新方法，以及一种关于黎曼流形流的理论。",
