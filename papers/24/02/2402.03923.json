    "translated_abstract": "传统的离线强化学习方法旨在学习最大化累积奖励（即回报）的最优策略。然而，随着应用范围的扩大，训练能够最大化回报并使实际回报与指定目标回报对齐的智能体变得越来越重要，从而控制智能体的性能。决策Transformer（DT）通过监督学习优化生成以目标回报为条件的动作的策略，并配备了使用目标回报控制智能体的机制。尽管DT旨在对齐实际回报与目标回报，但我们在实验中发现了DT中实际回报与目标回报之间的差异。在本文中，我们提出了返回对齐的决策Transformer（RADT），旨在有效地将实际回报与目标回报对齐。我们的模型将回报从传统的输入序列中分离出来，传统输入序列通常包含回报、状态和动作。",
