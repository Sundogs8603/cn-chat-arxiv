    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）如ChatGPT，展示了强大的零样本和遵循指令的能力，在人工智能的各个研究领域中引发了一场革命性的转变，尤其是对于开放式任务。尽管在图领域中这个想法较少被探索，尽管有许多强大的图模型（GMs）可用，但它们被限制在预定义形式的任务中。虽然已经提出了几种将LLMs应用于图的方法，但它们未能同时处理预定义任务和开放式任务，无论是将LLMs作为节点特征增强器还是作为独立预测器。为了打破这个困境，我们提出了一个名为GraphTranslator的翻译器，旨在通过预训练的GM和LLMs之间的桥梁，有效地处理预定义任务，并利用LLMs的扩展接口为GM提供各种开放式任务。为了训练这样的翻译器，我们提出了一个称为Producer的构建图文对齐数据的工具。",
