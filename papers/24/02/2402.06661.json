    "translated_abstract": "如今，移动设备已经成为数码相机的自然替代品，因为它们能够轻松快捷地捕捉日常情景，鼓励用户通过图像和视频来表达自己。这些视频可以通过不同的平台进行共享，从而暴露在犯罪分子的意图操纵之下，犯罪分子了解现有法医技术在司法过程中对无罪者进行指控或洗脱有罪者的弱点。通常情况下，制造商并不完全符合视频创建标准的规范。此外，分享在社交网络和即时通信应用程序中的视频经过滤波和压缩处理，以减小其大小、方便传输并优化存储在平台上。平台对规范和转换结果的疏漏嵌入了视频的多媒体容器中的特征模式。这些模式可用于区分视频的来源和处理历史。",
    "tldr": "通过分析多媒体容器结构，本论文研究了智能手机视频的身份验证和完整性，以提高在社交网络和通信应用程序中共享视频的安全性和可信度。"
