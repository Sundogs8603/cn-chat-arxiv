    "translated_abstract": "深度学习在几个物体识别基准上正在缩小与人类的差距。本文在涉及从不寻常视角观察物体的挑战性图像中对这一差距进行了研究。我们发现人类在识别不寻常姿势中的物体时表现出色，与先进的预训练网络（EfficientNet、SWAG、ViT、SWIN、BEiT、ConvNext）相比，这些网络在此情况下普遍脆弱。值得注意的是，随着我们限制图像曝光时间，人类的表现下降到深度网络的水平，这表明人类在识别不寻常姿势中的物体时需要额外的心理过程（需要额外的时间）。最后，我们分析了人类与网络的错误模式，发现即使在限制时间的情况下，人类与前馈深度网络也有不同。我们得出结论，需要更多的工作将计算机视觉系统带到人类视觉系统的鲁棒性水平。理解在外部情况下发生的心理过程的本质是必要的。",

However, as image exposure time is limited, human performance deteriorates to the level of deep networks, suggesting the involvement of additional mental processes for humans in identifying objects in unusual poses. Moreover, there are differences in error patterns between humans and networks. Hence, further research is needed to enhance the robustness of computer vision systems."
