    "translated_abstract": "自杀意念检测是一个重要的研究领域，对于改进心理健康支持系统具有巨大潜力。然而，在自杀相关数据周围的敏感性导致难以访问到大规模的、注释的数据集，这是训练有效的机器学习模型所必需的。为了解决这个限制，我们引入了一种创新的策略，利用ChatGPT，Flan-T5和Llama等生成式AI模型的能力，为自杀意念检测创建合成数据。我们的数据生成方法基于从心理学文献中提取的社会因素，并旨在确保涵盖与自杀意念相关的基本信息。在我们的研究中，我们与基于BERT系列结构的现有NLP分类模型进行了基准测试。当在现实世界的UMD数据集上训练时，这些传统模型的F1分数通常在0.75到0.87之间。我们的合成数据驱动方法，提供了一种有效的替代选择，产生具有竞争力的性能。",
