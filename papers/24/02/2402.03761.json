    "translated_abstract": "高光谱成像（HSI）用于荧光引导的脑肿瘤切除能够使人们能够看到不同组织之间的差异，而这些差异对人眼来说是无法辨别的。这种增强技术可以最大限度地切除脑肿瘤，提高患者的治疗效果。然而，HSI中的许多处理方法使用了简化的线性方法，无法捕捉到非线性、波长依赖性的现象，这些现象在准确恢复荧光物质丰度时必须进行建模。因此，我们提出了两个基于深度学习的模型，用于校正和分离，可以考虑非线性效应，并产生更准确的丰度估计。这两个模型都使用类似自动编码器的结构来处理获取的光谱。其中一个模型使用盐酸卟啉（PpIX）浓度标记进行训练，另一个模型经历半监督训练，首先无监督学习高光谱分离，然后学习使用具有异质光学和几何特性的荧光发射光谱进行校正。",
