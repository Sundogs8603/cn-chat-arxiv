    "translated_abstract": "近年来，由于其可扩展性、可维护性和灵活性，微服务在IT运营中得到了广泛应用。然而，当面临系统故障时，站点可靠性工程师很难找到根本原因，因为微服务中存在复杂的关系。先前的研究采用结构化学习方法（例如PC算法）来建立因果关系，并从因果图中得出根本原因。然而，他们忽略了时间序列数据的时间顺序，并未利用时间关系中蕴含的丰富信息。例如，在CPU利用率突然增加的情况下，可能会导致其他微服务的延迟增加。然而，在这种情况下，CPU利用率异常发生在延迟增加之前，而不是同时发生。结果，PC算法无法捕捉这样的特征。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了RUN，一种新的方法。",
