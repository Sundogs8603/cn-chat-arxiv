    "translated_abstract": "对数据隐私的日益关注导致了客户端-服务器应用中私有推理（PI）框架的发展，该框架既保护数据隐私又保护模型知识产权。然而，所需的密码原语导致了显著的延迟开销，限制了其广泛应用。同时，不断变化的环境要求PI服务对各种自然发生的和基于梯度的扰动具有鲁棒性。尽管已有一些工作专注于开发适用于PI的延迟-高效模型，但这些模型对鲁棒性的影响尚未被探索。为实现这个目标，本文提出了RLNet，一种鲁棒的线性化网络，通过减少高延迟的ReLU操作提供延迟改进，同时提高模型在清晰图像和损坏图像上的性能。特别地，RLNet模型提供了在清晰图像、自然扰动图像和基于梯度的扰动图像上的分类准确性改善的“三连赢”解决方案。",
