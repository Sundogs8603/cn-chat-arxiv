These challenges necessitate the development of advanced perception systems and motion planning algorithms capable of managing situations of considerable complexity. Although the end-to-end AD method utilizing LiDAR sensors has achieved significant success in this scenario, we argue that its drawbacks may hinder its practical application. Instead, we propose the vision-centric AD as a promising alternative offering a streamlined model without compromising performance. In this study, we present a path planning method that utilizes 2D bounding boxes of objects, developed through imitation learning in urban driving scenarios.
