    "translated_abstract": "随着近几十年来物联网和信息通信技术的系统进步，智能家居具备为用户提供家庭服务的能力。智能设备提供的家庭服务帮助用户在提高生活质量的目标上达到最大化的舒适水平。由于用户和智能设备之间通过不安全的通道进行通信，智能家居环境容易出现安全和隐私问题。需要在智能家居环境中建立一个安全的认证协议，使得智能设备和用户之间的设备认证成为可能。大多数现有的智能家居认证协议被发现无法实现安全的相互认证，增加了会话密钥泄露、冒充和盗窃智能设备攻击的可能性。本文提出了基于监督学习的安全的智能家居认证框架。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一个基于监督学习的安全的智能家居认证框架，解决了现有认证协议无法实现安全相互认证的问题，提高了智能家居环境中设备认证的可行性，并减少了会话密钥泄露、冒充和盗窃智能设备攻击的可能性。",
