    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)在各种任务中展现出了显著的能力。然而，它们有时会产生幻觉，特别是在它们可能生成不真实的回应，尽管拥有正确的知识的情况下。在本文中，我们提出了TruthX，一种用于在真实空间中编辑LLMs内部表示以获取其真实性的推断时间方法。TruthX利用自动编码器将LLM的表示分别映射到语义和真实潜在空间，并应用对比学习在真实空间中识别真实的编辑方向。在推断过程中，通过在真实空间中编辑LLM的内部表示，TruthX有效地增强了LLMs的真实性。实验证明，TruthX通过20%的平均值提高了13种先进LLMs在TruthfulQA基准测试中的真实性。进一步的分析表明，真实空间",
