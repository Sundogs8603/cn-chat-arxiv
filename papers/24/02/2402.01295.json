    "translated_abstract": "基于机器学习的数据驱动天气预报在全球中期预报中已经得到了快速发展，并且相较于传统的基于物理的动力学模型表现出更好的性能。然而，大多数这些机器学习模型在准确预测极端天气方面存在困难，而极端值预测与此密切相关。通过数学分析，我们证明使用对称损失，如均方误差（MSE），会导致预测有偏差并低估极值。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了Exloss，一种新的损失函数，通过非对称优化突出极值，以获得准确的极端天气预报。此外，我们还引入了一种无需训练的极值增强策略ExEnsemble，它增加了像素值的方差，并提高了预报的稳健性。结合先进的全球天气预报模型，广泛的实验证明了我们的方法",
