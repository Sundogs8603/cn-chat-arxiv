    "abstract": "Recent years have brought significant advances to Natural Language Processing (NLP), which enabled fast progress in the field of computational job market analysis. Core tasks in this application domain are skill extraction and classification from job postings. Because of its quick growth and its interdisciplinary nature, there is no exhaustive assessment of this emerging field. This survey aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of deep learning methodologies, datasets, and terminologies specific to NLP-driven skill extraction and classification. Our comprehensive cataloging of publicly available datasets addresses the lack of consolidated information on dataset creation and characteristics. Finally, the focus on terminology addresses the current lack of consistent definitions for important concepts, such as hard and soft skills, and terms relating to skill extraction and classification.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近几年，自然语言处理（NLP）取得了显著进展，使得计算机工作市场分析领域取得了快速发展。在该应用领域中，核心任务是从招聘信息中提取和分类技能。由于其快速增长和跨学科性质，目前尚缺乏对这一兴起领域的详尽评估。本调查旨在通过提供关于NLP驱动的技能提取和分类的深度学习方法、数据集和术语的全面概述来填补这一空白。我们对公开可获取的数据集进行了全面分类，解决了数据集创建和特征的信息缺乏的问题。最后，对术语的重点关注解决了目前对于重要概念（如硬技能和软技能）以及与技能提取和分类相关的术语缺乏一致定义的问题。",
