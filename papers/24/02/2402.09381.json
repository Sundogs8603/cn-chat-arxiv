    "translated_abstract": "重复DNA（重复）对于准确高效地进行基因组组装和序列比对提出了重要挑战。对于元基因组数据而言，这一挑战尤为突出，因为基因组动态性，如水平基因转移、基因复制以及基因损失/获得，使得从元基因组群体中准确组装基因组变得复杂。检测重复是克服这些挑战的关键第一步。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种名为GraSSRep的新方法，该方法利用组装图的结构，通过图神经网络（GNNs）在自监督学习框架中将DNA序列分类为重复和非重复类别。具体来说，我们将这个问题构建为在元基因组组装图中的节点分类任务。我们依靠一个高精度（但低召回率）的启发式方法以自监督的方式为一小部分节点生成伪标签。然后，我们使用这些伪标签进行训练。",
