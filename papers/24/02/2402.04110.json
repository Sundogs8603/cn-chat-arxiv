    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT因其不透明的行为而臭名昭著。本文试图揭示这一点，提供了对GPT-3.5和GPT-4的黑暗人格特质和阴谋信仰进行深入分析。采用了不同的心理测试和问卷，包括黑暗因子测验、Mach-IV量表、一般性阴谋信仰量表和阴谋心理量表。分析了回答的平均分数、标准差和显著性检验以研究GPT-3.5和GPT-4之间的差异。对于在人类研究中已经显示存在相互依赖的特质，还考虑了相关性。此外，将与在相应问卷中表现出不同回答行为的群组对应的系统角色应用于研究模型在回答中反映与这些角色相关的特征的能力。两个模型中的黑暗人格特质和阴谋信仰并不特别明显，差异较小。",
