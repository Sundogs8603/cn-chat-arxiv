    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel method to understand the factors affecting individuals' perception of transport accessibility, socioeconomic disparity, and public infrastructure. As opposed to the time consuming and expensive survey-based approach, this method can generate organic large-scale responses from social media and develop statistical models to understand individuals' perceptions of various transportation issues. This study retrieved and analyzed 36,098 tweets from New York City from March 19, 2020, to May 15, 2022. A state-of-the-art natural language processing algorithm is used for text mining and classification. A data fusion technique has been adopted to generate a series of socioeconomic traits that are used as explanatory variables in the model.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究提出了一种新方法来理解影响个体对交通可及性、社会经济差距和公共基础设施感知的因素。与耗时昂贵的调查方法相反，这种方法可以从社交媒体生成有机的大规模回应，并开发统计模型来理解个体对各种交通问题的感知。本研究从2020年3月19日至2022年5月15日，检索并分析了纽约市的36,098条推文。采用先进的自然语言处理算法进行文本挖掘和分类。采用数据融合技术生成一系列用作模型解释变量的社会经济特征。模型结果显示，女性和亚洲裔个体更倾向于讨论交通可及性，而那些经历高交通流量的人更加积极发声。然而，具有社会经济劣势的个体更关注公共交通问题，并表达出更强烈的关切。",
