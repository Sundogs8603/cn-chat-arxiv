However, examining a recent LED-based citation generation system, we find that many of the generated citations are generic summaries of the reference papers main contribution, ignoring the citation contexts focus on a different topic. To address this problem, we propose a simple modification to the citation text generation task: the generation target is not only the citation itself, but the entire context window, including the target citation.
