    "abstract": "This paper proposes a referencable pattern of the recovery of the consumption sector, a new dimension to observe and evaluate the intrinsic value of the consumption sector, and proposes the concept of sensory-based consumption and the ranking of the weights of different categories;creates the concept of digital consumption index, coupled with digital RMB index and China-style digital economy index. Finally we explain the internal logic of digital consumption as a consumption upgrade tool and a higher valuation target in the context of China's economic performance in 2022 and the Chinese government's policy in 2023, leading to the investment strategy of roller conduction effect.",
