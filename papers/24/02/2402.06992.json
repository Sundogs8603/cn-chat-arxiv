    "title": "A Rational Analysis of the Speech-to-Song Illusion",
    "abstract": "The speech-to-song illusion is a robust psychological phenomenon whereby a spoken sentence sounds increasingly more musical as it is repeated. Despite decades of research, a complete formal account of this transformation is still lacking, and some of its nuanced characteristics, namely, that certain phrases appear to transform while others do not, is not well understood. Here we provide a formal account of this phenomenon, by recasting it as a statistical inference whereby a rational agent attempts to decide whether a sequence of utterances is more likely to have been produced in a song or speech. Using this approach and analyzing song and speech corpora, we further introduce a novel prose-to-lyrics illusion that is purely text-based. In this illusion, simply duplicating written sentences makes them appear more like song lyrics. We provide robust evidence for this new illusion in both human participants and large language models.",

    "translated_title": "语音转换成歌曲的幻象的合理分析",
    "translated_abstract": "语音转换成歌曲的幻象是一种强大的心理现象，即说出的句子在不断重复中越来越像音乐。尽管经过几十年的研究，对这种转化的完整形式解释仍然缺乏，并且对其细微的特征，即某些短语的转化是否发生，也不太清楚。在这里，我们提供了这个现象的一个形式化解释，将其重新定义为一种统计推断，合理的决策者试图判断一系列话语更有可能是在歌曲中还是在讲话中产生的。通过使用这种方法并分析歌曲和讲话的语料库，我们进一步介绍了一种纯文本的小说转歌词的幻象。在这个幻象中，简单地复制书面句子会使它们看起来更像歌词。我们在人类参与者和大型语言模型中提供了这个新幻象的强有力的证据。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了对语音转换成歌曲的幻象的合理分析，将其视为一种统计推断过程，通过分析语料库，还发现了一种纯文本的小说转歌词的幻象，并提供了强有力的证据来支持这一观点。",
