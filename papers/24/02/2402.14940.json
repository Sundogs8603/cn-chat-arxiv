Objectives: This study aimed to assess the technical efficiency of the public hospital network in Morocco. Methods: This article compares the efficiency of 77 public hospital networks from 2017 to 2020. Data were collected from the Directorate of Planning and Financial Resources (DPFR) of the Health Ministry Marocco. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method was employed, using three inputs (Hospital, Physician and Paramedical) and four outputs (Functional capacity, Hospitalization days and Admission). Additionally, the Malmquist index (MI) is utilized to analyse the factors of production, and peer modelling is incorporated to address hospital inefficiency.
