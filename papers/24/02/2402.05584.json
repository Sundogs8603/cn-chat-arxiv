    "abstract": "Text data augmentation is a complex problem due to the discrete nature of sentences. Although rule-based augmentation methods are widely adopted in real-world applications because of their simplicity, they suffer from potential semantic damage. Previous researchers have suggested easy data augmentation with soft labels (softEDA), employing label smoothing to mitigate this problem. However, finding the best factor for each model and dataset is challenging; therefore, using softEDA in real-world applications is still difficult. In this paper, we propose adapting AutoAugment to solve this problem. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method can boost existing augmentation methods and that rule-based methods can enhance cutting-edge pre-trained language models. We offer the source code.",

    "translated_abstract": "文本数据增强是一个复杂的问题，因为句子的离散性质。尽管基于规则的增强方法因其简单性而在实际应用中被广泛采用，但它们可能导致潜在的语义损害。以往的研究者提出了使用软标签（softEDA）进行简单数据增强，并采用标签平滑来减轻这个问题。然而，针对每个模型和数据集找到最佳因子是具有挑战性的，因此在实际应用中使用softEDA仍然困难。在本文中，我们提出了将AutoAugment应用于解决这个问题的方法。实验结果表明，所提出的方法可以提升现有的增强方法，并且基于规则的方法可以增强先进的预训练语言模型。我们提供源代码。",
