    "translated_abstract": "针对非对比度CT影像中腹部主动脉的分割问题是计算机辅助内腔导航的一个复杂任务，特别是在不适合使用对比剂的情况下。虽然最新的深度学习分割模型已经被提出来处理这个任务，但它们都是基于人工注释的强标签进行训练。然而，在非对比度CT中由于主动脉边界的固有模糊，强标签的可靠性可能受到损害，从而导致过拟合风险。本文介绍了一种基于高斯伪标签的方法，通过深度监督将其集成到传统的深度学习模型中，以实现形态注意力（MA）的增强。由于高斯伪标签保留了主动脉的形态特征，而没有明确地表示其边界分布，我们认为它在训练过程中可以保持主动脉的形态学，同时减轻模糊边界的负面影响，降低过拟合的风险。",
