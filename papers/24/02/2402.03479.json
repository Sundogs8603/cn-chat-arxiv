We discover that, for deep actor-critic architectures sharing their base layers, prioritising levels according to their value loss minimises the mutual information between the agent's internal representation and the set of training levels in the generated training data. This provides a novel theoretical justification for the implicit regularisation achieved by certain adaptive sampling strategies.

    "translated_abstract": "使用深度强化学习训练的自主代理通常缺乏成功地推广到新环境的能力，即使这些环境与它们在训练过程中遇到的环境具有相似的特征。本研究探讨了个体环境实例（或级别）的采样对强化学习代理的零样本推广能力的影响。我们发现，对于共享基本层的深度演员-评论家架构，根据其值损失优先选择级别，可以最小化代理的内部表示与生成的训练数据中的训练级别之间的互信息。这为某些自适应采样策略实现的隐式正则化提供了新颖的理论解释。然后，我们将注意力转向无监督环境设计（UED）方法，这些方法对数据生成机制具有更多控制。我们发现现有的UED方法可以显著改变训练数据中的环境实例，从而影响代理的表现能力。",
