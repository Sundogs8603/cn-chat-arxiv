    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了Slate上下文强盗问题中的离策略评估（OPE），其中一个策略选择称为slates的多维动作。这个问题在推荐系统、搜索引擎、营销以及医疗应用中广泛存在，然而，由于动作空间大，典型的逆倾向评分（IPS）估计器存在较大的方差，使得有效的OPE成为一个重大挑战。伪逆（PI）估计器已被引入以减小方差问题，通过假设奖励函数线性，但这可能导致显著的偏差，因为这个假设在观测数据中很难验证并且经常会被实质性违反。为了解决之前估计器的局限性，我们开发了一种新的Slate Bandit OPE估计器，称为潜在IPS（LIPS），它在低维度的Slate抽象空间中定义了重要性权重，我们通过数据驱动的方式优化Slate抽象来最小化LIPS的偏差和方差。",
