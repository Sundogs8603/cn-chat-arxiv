    "translated_abstract": "政府官员与市民之间的互动影响公共福祉和民主社会的正当性。警察是国家最显而易见、最接触市民的代理人，在交通站停期间，他们每年与公众互动超过2000万次。如今，这些互动经常被戴在身上的摄像机记录下来，这被视为提高警察问责制和改善警民互动的手段。然而，由于缺乏可靠的自动化工具来分析这些复杂而有争议的警民互动，这些记录的及时分析受到了阻碍。本文提出了一种新的多角度、多模态机器学习（ML）工具的方法，用于分析来自这些身上摄像机记录的音频、视频和文字信息。我们的方法首先确定与不同利益相关者最相关的沟通方面，包括共同感知互动的标志标记以及具有这些标记的符号。",
