Lack of supervision, unbalanced classes, noisy data and long documents often affect real problems in vertical domains such as finance, law and health. To support industry-oriented research, we present BUSTER, a BUSiness Transaction Entity Recognition dataset. The dataset consists of 3779 manually annotated documents on financial transactions.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管自然语言处理在过去几年取得了重大突破，但将这些进展转化为实际的商业案例仍然具有挑战性。其中一个原因在于流行的基准数据与实际数据之间的差异。缺乏监督、类别不平衡、噪声数据和长文档经常影响金融、法律和健康等垂直领域的实际问题。为了支持面向行业的研究，我们提供了一个名为BUSTER的“商业交易实体识别”数据集。该数据集包含了3779份手动标注的金融交易文档。我们建立了几个基准模型，利用了通用和领域特定的语言模型。表现最佳的模型还被用于自动标注6196份文档，我们将其作为额外的银标准数据集发布给BUSTER。",
