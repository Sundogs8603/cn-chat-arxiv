    "translated_abstract": "集成学习由于其改善预测性能的潜力，一直是机器学习研究的焦点。本研究重新审视了自1990年以来，历史上仅限于回归问题的偏差-方差-协方差分析的集成错误分解的基础性研究。最近的进展引入了一种“多样性的统一理论”，提出了一种创新的偏差-方差-多样性分解框架。借助这种现代理解，我们的研究系统地探索了这种分解在指导新的集成学习算法的创建方面的应用。我们以回归任务为重点，采用神经网络作为基学习者，以调查这个理论框架的实际影响。这种方法使用了7种简单的集成方法，我们称之为策略，用于神经网络生成了21种新的集成算法。其中，大部分方法与“snapshot”策略聚合在一起，这是7种策略中的一种。",
