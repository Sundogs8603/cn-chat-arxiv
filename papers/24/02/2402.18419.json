    "title": "Can GPT Improve the State of Prior Authorization via Guideline Based Automated Question Answering?",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.18419v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Health insurance companies have a defined process called prior authorization (PA) which is a health plan cost-control process that requires doctors and other healthcare professionals to get clearance in advance from a health plan before performing a particular procedure on a patient in order to be eligible for payment coverage. For health insurance companies, approving PA requests for patients in the medical domain is a time-consuming and challenging task. One of those key challenges is validating if a request matches up to certain criteria such as age, gender, etc. In this work, we evaluate whether GPT can validate numerous key factors, in turn helping health plans reach a decision drastically faster. We frame it as a question answering task, prompting GPT to answer a question from patient electronic health record. We experiment with different conventional prompting techniques as well as introduce our own novel prompting technique. Mo",

    "translated_abstract": "卫生保险公司有一个被称为先前授权（PA）的流程，这是一种卫生计划成本控制流程，要求医生和其他医疗专业人员在对患者执行特定程序之前必须事先获得卫生计划的批准，以便有资格获得支付覆盖。对卫生保险公司来说，批准医疗领域患者的PA请求是一项耗时且具有挑战性的任务。其中的一项关键挑战是验证请求是否符合某些标准，如年龄、性别等。在这项工作中，我们评估了GPT是否能验证大量关键因素，从而帮助卫生计划更快地做出决策。我们将其构建为一个问答任务，促使GPT从患者的电子健康记录中回答问题。我们尝试了不同的传统提示技术，同时还引入了我们自己的新颖提示技术。",
