    "translated_abstract": "在专利审查中，对于及时和有效地回应审查意见（OAs）对于获得专利至关重要，然而过去的自动化和人工智能研究很少涉及到这一方面。为了弥补这一空白，我们的研究介绍了专利审查意见响应智能系统（PARIS）及其先进版本LE-PARIS。这些系统旨在加快专利律师在协作处理OA回应方面的效率。系统的关键特征包括构建OA主题数据库，开发响应模板，以及实施推荐系统和基于LLM的响应生成。我们的验证涉及使用USPTO Office Action数据库和律师与我们系统的长期交互数据进行的多范式分析，为期六年。通过五个研究，我们利用主题建模和提出的Delphi过程来检验OA主题的建设性（研究1和2），还有使用推荐系统和基于LLM的响应生成来提高回应质量（研究3和4），以及经过训练的LLM对于回应自动生成的可行性（研究5）。",
