    "translated_abstract": "基础模型（FMs）如大型语言模型通过在各种任务中展示出色的性能，改变了人工智能领域。然而，它们还存在许多限制，阻止了它们在许多实际系统中的广泛应用，这些系统通常要求更高的可信度和可用性。由于FMs是使用旨在以自我监督方式重新构建训练语料库的损失函数进行训练的，所以不能保证模型的输出与用户对特定任务的偏好一致。在本综述论文中，我们提出了一个概念框架，该框架概括了各种代理如何与FMs进行交互，并通过知识增强和推理来适应一组任务。我们的框架阐明了代理角色类别，如更新基础FM，辅助提示FM和评估FM输出。我们还将几种最先进的方法进行了代理交互原型的分类。",
