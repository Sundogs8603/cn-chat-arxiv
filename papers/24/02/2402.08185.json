    "translated_abstract": "现代深度学习技术以模仿传统数值天气预报模型并从全球大气再分析数据派生而来，在几年内引起了重大革命。在这种新范式中，我们的研究引入了一种新颖的策略，不再依赖于高分辨率数据（通常受计算资源限制），而是利用低分辨率数据（2.5度）进行全球天气预报和气候数据分析。我们的主要关注点是评估基于数据驱动的天气预报（DDWP）框架，特别关注样本大小的充分性、模型的结构改进以及气候数据表达当前气候趋势的能力。通过使用自适应傅里叶神经算子（AFNO）模型通过FourCastNet和提出的时间滑动方法来扩充ECMWF再分析v5（ERA5）数据集，本文通过添加更多变量和新颖的方法改进了传统方法。",
