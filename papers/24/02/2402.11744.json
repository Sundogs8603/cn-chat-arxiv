    "translated_abstract": "机器生成文本（MGT）检测旨在识别一段文本是机器写作还是人类写作。先前的工作主要将MGT构建为对整个文档的二元分类任务，对文档中仅部分内容为机器生成的情况进行的研究有限。本文首次深入研究了定位文档中机器生成部分的MGT。因此，如果恶意行为者更改新闻文章的关键部分以传播错误信息，整个文档的MGT检测可能会失败，因为绝大部分是人类写作，但我们的方法由于其细粒度的方法可以成功。我们的MGT定位任务面临的一个关键挑战是，短跨度的文本，例如一个句子，由于长度较短几乎不提供指示其是否机器生成的信息。为了解决这个问题，我们利用上下文信息，预测多个句子是机器生成还是人类写作。",
