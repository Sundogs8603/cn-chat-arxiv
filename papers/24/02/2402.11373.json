    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11373v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Flight delays are a reality in the modern air industry worldwide. However, studies in the literature have investigated the competitive determinants of delays arising from factors originating at the airport and along the route separately. This work aims to present a national study that used a unifying approach from the literature, considering the local and global effects of competition on delays. The analysis took into account a phenomenon known as the \"internalization of externalities\" of airport congestion. Furthermore, it discusses the relationship between quality and competition on the route and the impacts of the entry of a low-cost carrier (LCC) on the delays of incumbent airlines in the Brazilian air market. The literature suggests that there is evidence of congestion internalization at Brazilian airports, in parallel with competition for quality at the route level. Additionally, the potential competition caused by the presence of ",

    "translated_abstract": "航班延误是现代全球航空业的现实。然而，文献中的研究已经分别调查了起因于机场和沿途因素的延误的竞争决定因素。本研究旨在呈现一项国家性研究，该研究采用了文献中的统一方法，考虑了竞争对延误的地方和全球效应。该分析考虑了被称为机场拥挤的“外部性内部化”现象。此外，论文还讨论了航线上质量和竞争之间的关系，以及廉价航空公司(LCC)进入巴西航空市场对现有航空公司延误的影响。文献表明，在巴西机场存在内部化拥挤的证据，与航线层面的质量竞争并行。此外，由廉价航空公司进入引起的潜在竞争也可能导致",
