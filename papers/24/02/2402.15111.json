    "translated_abstract": "安全聚合使得联邦学习（FL）能够通过本地梯度更新对客户端进行协作训练，而无需暴露原始数据。然而，现有的安全聚合方案每轮必须执行昂贵的刷新设置，因为每个客户端需要在不同轮次建立新的独立于输入的密钥。最新研究Flamingo（S&P 2023）设计了一种基于共享传输的可重复使用密钥，以支持服务器持续执行多轮聚合。然而，它提出的共享传输机制仅能以P概率实现，具有有限的可靠性。为解决上述问题，我们提出了一种更可靠且支持匿名认证的名为Chu-ko-nu的多轮安全聚合方案。具体来说，在共享传输方面，Chu-ko-nu通过补充秘密密钥组件的重新分配过程，突破了概率P的限制。",
