    "translated_abstract": "图像分类器通常依赖于卷积神经网络(CNN)来完成任务，而CNN相比于多层感知机(MLP)更加庞大，这在实时应用中可能会带来问题。此外，许多图像分类模型适用于RGB和灰度数据集，但仅仅使用灰度图像的分类器相对较少见。灰度图像分类具有广泛的应用，包括但不限于医学图像分类和合成孔径雷达(SAR)自动目标识别(ATR)。因此，我们提出了一种使用图像的矢量化视图的新型灰度(单通道)图像分类方法。我们通过将图像视为矢量，并将问题设置为灰度图像分类问题，充分利用了MLP的轻量级特性。我们发现，批次级别使用单个图卷积层可以提高模型的准确性并减小性能的差异。此外，我们开发了定制的准确率估计方法。",
