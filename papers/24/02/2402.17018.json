    "translated_abstract": "我们测试了通过在一个冻结的分类器之前增加一个可微且完全卷积的模型，并具有跳跃连接的前端增强神经模型。通过使用较小的学习率进行大约一个epoch的训练，我们获得了一些模型，这些模型在保持骨干分类器准确性的同时，对包括AutoAttack软件包中的APGD和FAB-T攻击在内的梯度攻击具有异常的抵抗力，这归因于梯度掩盖。梯度掩盖现象并不新鲜，但对于这些没有梯度破坏部分（如JPEG压缩或预计导致梯度减小的部分）的完全可微模型来说，掩盖的程度相当显著。尽管黑盒攻击对梯度掩盖可能部分有效，但通过将模型组合成随机集合，可以轻松击败它们。我们估计这样的集合在CIFAR10和CIF等上实现了几乎SOTA级别的AutoAttack准确性。",
