We consider a flexible framework in which each edge probability, together with the probability of community assignment, are also impacted by observed covariates. We propose a computationally tractable two-step procedure to estimate the conditional edge probabilities as well as the community assignment probabilities. The first step relies on a spectral clustering algorithm applied to a localized adjacency matrix of the network. In the second step, k-nearest neighbor regression estimates are computed on the extracted communities. We study the statistical properties of these estimators by providing non-asymptotic bounds.",

    "translated_abstract": "在网络的标准随机块模型中，两个节点之间的连接概率（通常称为边缘概率）取决于这些节点所属的未观察到的社区。我们考虑了一个灵活的框架，其中每个边缘概率以及社区分配概率还受到观测到的协变量的影响。我们提出了一个可计算的两步过程，用于估计条件边缘概率以及社区分配概率。第一步依赖于应用于网络的局部邻接矩阵的谱聚类算法。在第二步中，对提取的社区进行k最近邻回归估计。我们通过提供非渐近界限来研究这些估计量的统计特性。",
