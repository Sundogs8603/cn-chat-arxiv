In this paper, we attempt to thoroughly examine FM-based recommendation systems (FM4RecSys). We start by reviewing the research background of FM4RecSys. Then, we provide a systematic taxonomy of existing FM4RecSys research works, which can be divided into four different parts including data characteristics, representation learning, model type, and downstream tasks. Within each part, we review the key recent research developments, outlining the representative models and discussing their characteristics. Moreover, we elaborate on the open problems and opportunities of FM4RecSys aiming to shed light on future research directions in this area. In conclusion, we recap our findings and discuss the emerging trends in this field.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，基础模型（FMs）凭借其广泛的知识库和复杂的架构，在推荐系统（RSs）领域提供了独特的机会。 本文试图全面审视基于FM的推荐系统（FM4RecSys）。 我们首先回顾了FM4RecSys的研究背景。 然后，我们提供了现有FM4RecSys研究工作的系统分类，可分为数据特征，表示学习，模型类型和下游任务四个不同部分。 在每个部分中，我们回顾了关键的最新研究进展，概述了代表性模型，并讨论了它们的特点。 此外，我们详细阐述了FM4RecSys的开放问题和机遇，旨在为这一领域的未来研究方向提供启示。 总之，我们总结了研究结果并讨论了该领域的新兴趋势。",
