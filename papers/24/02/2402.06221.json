    "abstract": "Crafting the ideal, job-specific resume is a challenging task for many job applicants, especially for early-career applicants. While it is highly recommended that applicants tailor their resume to the specific role they are applying for, manually tailoring resumes to job descriptions and role-specific requirements is often (1) extremely time-consuming, and (2) prone to human errors. Furthermore, performing such a tailoring step at scale while applying to several roles may result in a lack of quality of the edited resumes. To tackle this problem, in this demo paper, we propose ResumeFlow: a Large Language Model (LLM) aided tool that enables an end user to simply provide their detailed resume and the desired job posting, and obtain a personalized resume specifically tailored to that specific job posting in the matter of a few seconds. Our proposed pipeline leverages the language understanding and information extraction capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Goog",

    "translated_abstract": "对于许多求职者来说，制作符合特定职位要求的理想简历是一项具有挑战性的任务，尤其是对于初入职场的求职者来说。虽然强烈建议求职者根据他们申请的具体职位定制简历，但手动根据工作描述和职位要求来定制简历通常 (1) 非常耗时，且 (2) 容易出错。此外，在申请多个职位时进行这样的定制步骤可能导致编辑简历质量不高。为了解决这个问题，在本演示论文中，我们提出了ResumeFlow: 一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）的工具，使终端用户只需提供详细的简历和所需的职位发布信息，就能在几秒钟内获得一个针对该特定职位发布的个性化简历。我们提出的流程利用了最先进的LLM（如OpenAI的GPT-4和Google的......）",
