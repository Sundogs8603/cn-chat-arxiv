    "translated_abstract": "偏差Gromov-Wasserstein（PGW）问题可以比较具有不均匀质量的度量空间中的测度，从而实现这些空间之间的不平衡和部分匹配。本文证明了PGW问题可以转化为Gromov-Wasserstein问题的一个变种，类似于把偏差最优运输问题转化为最优运输问题。这个转化导致了两个新的求解器，基于Frank-Wolfe算法，数学和计算上等价，提供了高效的PGW问题解决方案。我们进一步证明了PGW问题构成了度量测度空间的度量。最后，我们通过与现有基线方法在形状匹配和正样本未标记学习问题上的计算时间和性能比较，验证了我们提出的求解器的有效性。",
