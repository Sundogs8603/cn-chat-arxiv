    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）应用，如ChatGPT，是在线信息获取（IS）和问题解决任务的强大工具。然而，用户仍然面临着初始化和优化提示的挑战，他们的认知障碍和偏见进一步阻碍了任务完成。这些问题反映了信息获取和交互式信息检索领域所面临的更广泛挑战。为了解决这些问题，我们的方法通过提示工程将任务上下文和用户感知融入到人-ChatGPT交互中。我们开发了一个类似于ChatGPT的平台，集成了支持性功能，包括感知表达、提示建议和对话解释。我们的用户研究结果表明，这些支持功能可以帮助用户管理期望，减少认知负荷，更好地优化提示，并增加用户参与度。这项研究提升了我们对于设计主动性和用户中心系统与LLMs的理解。",
