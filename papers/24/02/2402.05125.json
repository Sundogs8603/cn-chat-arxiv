    "translated_abstract": "将患者与临床试验匹配是推出新药的关键难题。目前，识别符合试验入选标准的患者是高度手动的，每位患者需花费长达1小时。然而，自动筛选具有挑战性，因为它需要理解非结构化的临床文本。大型语言模型（LLMs）提供了一个有望的解决方案。在这项工作中，我们探索了它们在试验匹配中的应用。首先，我们设计了一个基于LLM的系统，可以在给定一个患者的病史作为非结构化的临床文本时，评估该患者是否符合一组包含标准（也以自由文本形式指定）。我们的零样本系统在n2c2 2018队列选择基准测试中取得了最先进的得分。其次，我们通过识别一种提示策略，改善了我们方法的数据和成本效率，该策略与现状相比可以将患者匹配时间和成本降低一个数量级，并且开发了一个两阶段的检索流程，减少了匹配消除的次数。",
