    "translated_abstract": "天气预测是一个至关重要但具有挑战性的领域，最近基于深度学习（DL）的模型已经接近传统数值天气预报（NWP）模型的性能。然而，这些DL模型通常复杂且资源密集，面临着在训练后灵活性有限和整合NWP预测方面的限制，由此可能导致不真实的预测而引起可靠性问题。为此，我们引入了一种新的方法，利用扩散模型（DM）进行天气预测。特别是，我们的方法能够在相同的建模框架下实现直接和迭代预测。我们的模型不仅能够独立生成预测，还可以在采样过程中嵌入NWP预测，甚至可以适应不同的提前期。我们模型的灵活性和可控性为广大天气社区提供了更加可信赖的DL系统。另外，将持续性预测融入我们的方法可以改善预测性能。",
