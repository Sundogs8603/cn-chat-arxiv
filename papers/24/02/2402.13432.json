    "translated_abstract": "生物医学领域在自然语言处理（NLP）领域引起了极大的兴趣，随着预训练语言模型（PLMs）的实质性进展。然而，由于不同模型之间评估协议的变化，比较这些模型已经变得具有挑战性。一个公平的解决方案是将不同的下游任务聚合到一个基准中，允许从各种角度评估PLMs的内在品质。尽管这一倡议仍然局限于少数语言，特别是英语和中文，但已经在生物医学领域展开。这一限制阻碍了对最新的法语生物医学模型的评价，因为它们要么在少量任务上进行评估，而且使用的协议不够标准化，要么使用一般的下游任务进行评估。为弥补这一研究差距，并考虑到法语的独特敏感性，我们提出了首个公开可用的法语生物医学基准",
