    "translated_abstract": "利用大型语言模型（LLMs），自主代理能够显著提升，具备处理各种任务的能力。在无限环境中，为了提高效率和效果，优化协作需要灵活的调整。然而，当前的研究主要强调固定的、任务导向的工作流程，忽视了以代理为中心的组织结构。受人类组织行为的启发，我们引入了一种自组织代理系统（S-Agents），其中包括动态工作流程的“代理树”结构、平衡信息优先级的“沙漏代理架构”以及允许代理之间异步执行任务的“非阻塞协作”方法。这种结构可以自主协调一组代理，有效地解决无限且动态的环境挑战，无需人工干预。我们的实验表明，S-Agents能够熟练地执行协作建筑任务和资源收集。",
