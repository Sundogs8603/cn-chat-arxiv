Many semantic search problems, such as image and document search with timestamp filters, or product search with cost filters, are natural examples of this problem. We propose and theoretically analyze a modular tree-based framework for transforming an index that solves the traditional c-approximate nearest neighbor problem into a data structure that solves window search. On standard nearest neighbor benchmark datasets equipped with random label values, adversarially constructed embeddings, and image search embeddings with real timestamps, we obtain up to a $75\\times$ speedup over existing solutions at the same level of recall.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们定义并研究了$\\textit{c-近似窗口搜索}$问题：近似最近邻搜索其中数据集中的每个点都有一个数值标签，目标是在任意标签范围内找到查询点的最近邻。许多语义搜索问题，例如带有时间戳过滤器的图像和文档搜索，或带有成本过滤器的产品搜索，是这个问题的自然例子。我们提出并在理论上分析了一种基于模块化树的框架，用于将解决传统c-近似最近邻问题的索引转化为解决窗口搜索的数据结构。在标准的最近邻基准数据集上，配备了随机标签值、对抗性构建的嵌入以及带有真实时间戳的图像搜索嵌入，我们获得了与现有解决方案相比高达75倍的速度提升，同时保持相同的召回率。",
