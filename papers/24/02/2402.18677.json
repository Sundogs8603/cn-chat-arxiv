    "translated_abstract": "安全是许多机器人系统的基本要求。控制屏障函数（CBF）的方法已被提出，用于确保机器人系统的安全性。然而，这些方法的有效性在很大程度上取决于CBF的选择。受神经网络的通用逼近能力启发，越来越多的人开始倾向于使用神经网络表示CBF，从而引出了神经CBF（NCBF）的概念。然而，目前的NCBF是在良性环境中进行训练和部署的，这使得它们在机器人系统经历传感器故障和攻击的情况下无效。在本文中，我们研究了在传感器故障和攻击下机器人系统的安全关键控制综合。我们的主要贡献是开发和综合一类新的CBF，我们将其称为容错神经控制屏障函数（FT-NCBF）。我们推导了FT-NCBF确保s",
