    "translated_abstract": "随着人工智能系统的权力和普及程度的增加，设计能够为不同价值观和观点的人服务的人工智能系统变得愈发重要。然而，将模型对齐以服务多元人类价值观仍然是一个待解决的研究问题。在本文中，我们提出了一条通向多元对齐的路线图，具体使用语言模型作为测试平台。我们确定和形式化了三种可能的方式来定义和实现人工智能系统中的多元主义：1）Overton多元模型，展示合理反应的光谱；2）可操控的多元模型，可以调整以反映特定的观点；3）分布多元模型，在分布中很好地校准给定人群的模型。我们还提出和形式化了三种可能的多元基准类别：1）多目标基准；2）权衡可操控基准，鼓励模型对任意权衡进行调整；3）陪审团多元基准，明确地模拟了不同陪审团的意见。",
