    "translated_abstract": "2022年11月发布的ChatGPT引发了高等教育机构普遍采用生成式人工智能（GenAI）。这些机构急于应对其使用，尤其是学生的使用，首先试图对其进行规范，并争论其在教学中的有益整合。在发布后的一年里，高等教育机构越来越多地提供了GenAI的政策和指南。本文通过对116所被归类为高研究活动或R1机构的美国大学所产生的文件进行深入分析，全面了解了提供给机构利益相关者的GenAI相关建议和指导。经过广泛分析，我们发现绝大多数大学（N=73，63%）鼓励使用GenAI，并且许多大学提供了详细的课堂使用指导（N=48，41%）。超过一半的机构提供了示例教学大纲（N=65，56%），一半（N=58，50%）提供了样本GenAI课程和活动，这些将有助于机构的实施。",
