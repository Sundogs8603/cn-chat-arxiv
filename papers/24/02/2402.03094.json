    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了跨领域少样本目标检测（CD-FSOD）的挑战，旨在开发一个准确的目标检测器，用最少的标记样本来检测新领域的目标。虽然基于转换器的开集检测器（例如DE-ViT）在开放词汇目标检测和传统的少样本目标检测方面表现出色，能够检测到训练过程中没有见过的类别，我们自然会提出两个关键问题：1）这种开集检测方法能否容易地推广到CD-FSOD？2）如果不能，如何在面对显著的领域差异时增强开集方法的结果？为了回答第一个问题，我们引入了几个衡量领域差异的指标，并建立了一个具有多样领域度量值的新的CD-FSOD基准。在这个基准上评估了一些最先进的开集目标检测方法，在域外数据集中观察到明显的性能下降。这表明采用这些方法在CD-FSOD上失败了。",
