    "translated_abstract": "空气质量预测和建模在公共卫生和环境管理中起着关键作用，帮助个人和当局做出明智决策。尽管传统的数据驱动模型在这个领域已经显示出了潜力，但它们在长期预测精度上可能受到限制，特别是在数据稀疏或不完整的情况下，它们往往依赖于缺乏坚实物理基础的黑盒深度学习结构，导致预测的透明度和可解释性降低。为了解决这些限制，本文提出了一种名为Physics guided Neural Network for Air Quality Prediction（AirPhyNet）的新方法。具体而言，我们利用空气颗粒运动的两个成熟的物理原理（扩散和平流）将其表示为微分方程网络。然后，我们利用图结构将物理知识融入神经网络架构，并利用潜在表示来捕捉时空关系。",
