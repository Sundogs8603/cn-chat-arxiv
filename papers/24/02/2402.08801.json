Demonstrating an ability to generate instant, human-like responses to technical questions, ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPT's release, Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA: the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them.

    "translated_abstract": "自2022年11月发布以来，ChatGPT已经在Stack Overflow上引起轰动，这是开发人员关于编程和软件开发问题的首选平台。ChatGPT展示了生成即时、人类般回答技术问题的能力，引起了开发者社区对人工智能生成时代下人类驱动平台演变角色的辩论。ChatGPT发布两个月后，Meta发布了它自己的大型语言模型(LLM) LLaMA。为了 (i) 测量用户对Stack Overflow的时间演进下的参与程度；(ii) 量化LLMs回答的可靠性及其在长期内取代Stack Overflow的潜力；(iii) 确定和理解LLMs失败的原因；(iv) 对比LLMs。我们进行了实证研究，分析Stack Overflow上的问题，并使用这些LLMs来回答问题。",
    "tldr": "这篇论文通过对Stack Overflow问题的分析，研究了ChatGPT和LLaMA对于该平台的影响和可靠性，以及它们在长期内取代Stack Overflow的挑战。研究结果表明，LLMs在某些方面失败，并提供了对比LLMs的实证比较。"
