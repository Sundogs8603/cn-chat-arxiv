    "translated_abstract": "理解各种幽默风格对于理解幽默的多面性及其在心理学和人工智能等领域的影响至关重要。这种理解揭示了依据所采用的风格，幽默可以对个人的健康和人际关系产生治疗或有害的影响。虽然专门研究基于计算的幽默风格分析的研究仍然比较少见，但在相关任务中，特别是二元幽默和讽刺识别方面，已有大量研究蓬勃发展。在这项系统性文献综述中，我们调查了应用于这些相关任务的计算技术的现状，并揭示了它们与幽默风格分析的基本相关性。通过这项研究，我们揭示了常见的方法，阐明了各种数据集和评估指标，并有效地引导幽默研究的复杂领域。我们的努力确定了潜在的研究空白，并提出了有希望的方向。",
