    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了一种现代的预测不确定性估计方法，称为证据深度学习（EDL），其中通过最小化特定的目标函数，训练单个神经网络模型以学习预测分布上的元分布。尽管现有方法在经验性能方面表现强大，但Bengs等人的最近研究发现了现有方法的一个根本缺陷：即使在无限样本限制下，学习到的认知不确定性可能不会消失。通过提供文献中一类广泛使用的目标函数的统一视角，我们得到了这个观察的证实。我们的分析揭示了EDL方法本质上通过最小化分布与与样本大小无关的目标分布之间的特定差异度量来训练元分布，从而产生错误的认知不确定性。基于理论原则，我们提出通过将其建模为狄利克雷分布混合物来学习一致目标分布，从而改进了EDL方法。",
