Notably, the GINN formulation does not require training data, and as such can be considered generative modeling driven purely by constraints. We add an explicit diversity loss to mitigate mode collapse. We consider several constraints, in particular, the connectedness of components which we convert to a differentiable loss through Morse theory.

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了几何信息神经网络（GINNs）的概念，涵盖了（i）在几何约束下学习，（ii）神经场作为合适的表示，（iii）生成在几何任务中经常遇到的欠定系统的多样解决方案。值得注意的是，GINN的构建不需要训练数据，因此可以被纯约束驱动地视为生成建模。我们增加了显式的多样性损失来减轻模态坍缩。我们考虑了几种约束，特别是组件的连通性，我们通过莫尔斯理论将其转化为可微损失。在实验中，我们展示了在不断增加复杂性的二维和三维场景中，GINN学习范式的高效性。",
