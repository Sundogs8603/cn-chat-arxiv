However, the application has predominantly been limited to discriminative and question-answering tasks, which does not fully leverage their interactive potential. To address this limitation, our paper presents AI Hospital, a framework designed to build a real-time interactive diagnosis environment. To simulate the procedure, we collect high-quality medical records to create patient, examiner, and medical director agents. AI Hospital is then utilized for the interactive evaluation and collaboration of LLMs. Initially, we create a Multi-View Medical Evaluation (MVME) benchmark where various LLMs serve as intern doctors for interactive diagnosis. Subsequently, to improve diagnostic accuracy, we introduce a collaborative mechanism that involves iterative discussions and a dispute resolution process under the supervision of the medical director.

    "translated_abstract": "引入大型语言模型（LLMs）在医疗保健中的应用标志着重大的进展。然而，目前的应用主要局限于辨别和问答任务，没有充分发挥其交互潜力。为了解决这个局限，我们的论文提出了AI医院，一个旨在构建实时交互式诊断环境的框架。为了模拟过程，我们收集高质量的医疗记录，创建了患者、检查者和医疗主任代理。然后，利用AI医院进行LLMs的交互评估和协作。初始阶段，我们创建了一个多视图医学评估（MVME）基准，其中各种LLMs作为实习医生进行交互式诊断。随后，为了提高诊断准确性，我们引入了一种协作机制，涉及医疗主任的监督下的迭代讨论和争议解决过程。",
