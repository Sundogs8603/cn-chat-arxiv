    "translated_abstract": "多模式对比表示学习方法在各个领域取得了成功，部分原因是由于它们能够生成复杂现象的有意义的共享表示。为了增强对这些获得的表示的深度分析和理解，我们引入了一种特别针对多模态数据设计的统一因果模型。通过研究这个模型，我们展示了多模式对比表示学习在识别在提出的统一模型中的潜在耦合变量方面的优秀能力，即使在不同假设下导致的线性或置换变换。我们的发现揭示了预训练的多模态模型（如CLIP）通过线性独立分量分析这一令人惊讶的简单而高效的工具学习分离表示的潜力。实验证明了我们发现的鲁棒性，即使在被违反假设的情况下，也验证了所提出方法在学习疾病方面的有效性。",
