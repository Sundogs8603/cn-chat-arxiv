Recently, there has been a resurgent research interest in negotiation dialogue systems, whose goal is to create intelligent agents that can assist people in resolving conflicts or reaching agreements. Although there have been many explorations into negotiation dialogue systems, a systematic review of this task has not been performed to date. We aim to fill this gap by investigating recent studies in the field of negotiation dialogue systems, and covering benchmarks, evaluations and methodologies within the literature. We also discuss potential future directions, including multi-modal, multi-party and cross-cultural negotiation scenarios.

    "translated_abstract": "谈判是人类沟通中至关重要的能力。近年来，谈判对话系统的研究兴趣再度上升，其目标是创建智能代理，帮助人们解决冲突或达成协议。尽管已经有很多探索谈判对话系统的研究，但迄今为止还没有进行系统综述的工作。我们旨在填补这一空白，调查最近在谈判对话系统领域的研究，并涵盖文献中的基准、评估和方法论。我们还讨论了潜在的未来发展方向，包括多模态、多方和跨文化的谈判场景。我们的目标是为社群提供关于谈判对话系统的系统综述，并激发未来的研究。",
