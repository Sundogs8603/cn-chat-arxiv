Sheaves have originally been used in algebraic topology and logic. Recently, they have also modelled events such as physical experiments and natural language disambiguation processes. We extend the latter models from lexical ambiguities to discourse ambiguities arising from anaphora. To begin, we calculated a new measure of contextuality for a dataset of basic anaphoric discourses, resulting in a higher proportion of contextual models--82.9%--compared to previous work which only yielded 3.17% contextual models.

    "translated_abstract": "层是数学对象，由基础构成的拓扑空间和与之相关的数据组成，例如定义在开集上的连续函数。层最初用于代数拓扑和逻辑中。最近，它们也用于建模物理实验和自然语言消岐过程等事件。我们将这些模型从词汇歧义扩展到由指代产生的篇章歧义。首先，对一组基本的指代篇章数据计算了一个新的上下文性度量，结果表明上下文模型的比例更高，为82.9%，而之前的工作只有3.17%的上下文模型。随后，我们展示了如何将包含指代歧义的自然语言处理挑战——Winograd Schema建模为Bell-CHSH场景，其上下文比例为0.096。",
