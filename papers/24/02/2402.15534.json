To address this challenge, self-supervised pre-training has proven to outperform supervised pre-training in numerous downstream vision tasks, representing a significant breakthrough in the field.

    "translated_abstract": "胸部X线（CXR）是一种广泛应用的临床成像模态，在各种肺部和心脏相关疾病的诊断和预后中起着关键作用。传统的依赖放射学读片和监督学习的自动化临床诊断工具设计策略需要高质量注释训练数据，为了解决这一挑战，自监督预训练已被证明在许多下游视觉任务中胜过监督预训练，代表了该领域的重大突破。然而，医学成像预训练与自然图像（例如ImageNet）的预训练在很大程度上不同，因为临床图像具有独特属性。在这种背景下，我们介绍了多元概念建模（DiCoM），这是一种新颖的自监督训练范式，利用了学生教师框架来学习多元概念，从而有效表示CXR数据。",
