    "abstract": "Collaborative search supports multiple users working together to accomplish a specific search task. Research has found that designing lightweight collaborative search plugins within instant messaging platforms aligns better with users' collaborative habits. However, due to the complexity of multi-user interaction scenarios, it is challenging to implement a fully functioning lightweight collaborative search system. Therefore, previous studies on lightweight collaborative search had to rely on the Wizard of Oz paradigm. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to interact naturally with users and achieve complex information-seeking tasks through LLM-based agents. Hence, to better support the research in collaborative search, in this demo, we propose CoSearchAgent, a lightweight collaborative search agent powered by LLMs. CoSearchAgent is designed as a Slack plugin that can support collaborative search during multi-party conversations on this platform.

    "translated_abstract": "协作搜索支持多个用户共同完成特定的搜索任务。研究发现，将轻量级协作搜索插件设计在即时通讯平台内更符合用户的协作习惯。然而，由于多用户交互场景的复杂性，实现一个完全功能的轻量级协作搜索系统是具有挑战性的。因此，之前的轻量级协作搜索研究不得不依赖于\"吹牛大王\"范例。近年来，大型语言模型(LLM)已被证明可以与用户自然交互，并通过基于LLM的代理实现复杂的信息搜索任务。因此，为了更好地支持协作搜索研究，本文提出了CoSearchAgent，一种由LLM驱动的轻量级协作搜索代理。CoSearchAgent被设计为Slack插件，可以在该平台上的多方对话中支持协作搜索。",
