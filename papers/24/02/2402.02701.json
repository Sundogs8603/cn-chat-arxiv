    "translated_abstract": "最近，有许多努力致力于在视觉强化学习中学习对连续控制有用的策略。在这种场景下，学习一个具有泛化能力的策略非常重要，因为测试环境可能与训练环境不同，例如在部署过程中存在干扰因素。许多实际算法被提出来解决这个问题。然而，据我们所知，它们中没有一种算法能够从理论上解释泛化差距的影响因素以及为什么他们的方法有效。在本文中，我们通过在测试环境具有干扰因素时理论上回答影响泛化差距的关键因素来解决这个问题。我们的理论表明，最小化训练和测试环境之间的表示距离（与人类直觉一致）对于减少泛化差距的效益至关重要。我们的理论结果得到了DM数据的实证证据的支持。",
