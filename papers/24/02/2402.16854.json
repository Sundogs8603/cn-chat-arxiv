    "translated_abstract": "分子生成这一任务在计算上能表示分子的复杂方式中变得十分困难。在分子生成模型中常用的技术是使用带有递归神经网络的SMILES字符串，内置到变分自动编码器中，但这些技术存在许多问题：梯度消失，长距离遗忘和无效分子。在这项工作中，我们展示了通过以分层方式将递归神经网络与卷积网络相结合，我们能够从SMILES字符串中提取自回归信息，同时保持信号和长距离依赖性。这使得在重建已知分子时生成的分子具有非常高的有效性，达到了95%的水平。我们还观察到测试集和重建分子之间的平均Tanimoto相似度为0.6，这表明我们的方法能够在SMILES字符串和它们的学习表示之间进行映射。",
