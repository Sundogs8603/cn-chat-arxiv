Our framework comprises two parallel algorithms, NCA and InfoNCA, both enabling the direct extraction of an LM policy from reward data as well as preference data.

    "translated_abstract": "用户意图通常被形式化为需要在微调语言模型时最大化的评估奖励。现有的对齐方法，如直接优化偏好（DPO），主要适用于隐含定义而非明确给定奖励的两两偏好数据。在本文中，我们引入了一个通用的LM对齐框架，利用噪声对比估计（NCE）来解决明确注释有标量评估的奖励数据处理的差距。我们的框架包括两个并行算法，NCA和InfoNCA，两者都能从奖励数据和偏好数据中直接提取LM策略。值得注意的是，我们证明了DPO损失是我们提出的InfoNCA目标在两两偏好设置下的特殊情况，从而集成和扩展了当前的对齐理论。通过对比NCA和InfoNCA，我们展示了InfoNCA和DPO如何在不同响应对于单个指令的相对可能性上进行调整。",
