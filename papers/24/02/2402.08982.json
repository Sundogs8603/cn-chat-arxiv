    "translated_abstract": "特征选择是数据挖掘中的关键步骤，通过降低数据维度来提高模型性能。然而，收集到的数据的维度越来越高，使得计算复杂度与维度数量呈指数增长。为了解决这个问题，进化计算方法因其简单性和适用性而越来越受欢迎。不幸的是，不同的进化计算方法的多样设计导致其处理不同数据的能力不尽相同，经常无法有效地利用和共享信息。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为PSO-based Multi-task Evolutionary Learning (MEL)的新方法，它利用多任务学习来解决这些挑战。通过在不同特征选择任务之间共享信息，MEL实现了增强的学习能力和效率。我们通过广泛的实验评估了MEL的有效性。",
