    "translated_abstract": "复杂和不透明的黑盒子模型的增加需要采用可解释的措施，其中一种选择是提取有理的模型，它们作为更可解释的替代方案。这些模型，也称为先解释然后预测模型，使用解释模型来提取有理，然后使用提取的信息来调整预测模型。它们的主要目标是提供精确和忠实的解释，由提取的有理表示。在本文中，我们采用半监督方法来优化提取有理的可行性。我们采用一个预训练的自然语言推理（NLI）模型，并在一个小型的有监督有理集（10%）上进一步微调它。通过蕴涵对齐，NLI预测模型被利用作为解释模型的一种监督信号源。通过在问答任务中强制解释和答案之间的对齐一致，我们证明了性能得到了提升。",
