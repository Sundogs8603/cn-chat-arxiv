    "translated_abstract": "在法律决策中，当法官无法达成一致决定时，就会出现分割投票(SV)，给必须处理各种法律论点和意见的律师带来了困难。在高风险领域，理解人类和AI系统之间感知困难的一致性对于建立信任至关重要。然而，现有的自然语言处理校准方法主要关注分类器对预测性能的认知，通常是与人类的多数类进行比较，而忽视了人类标签变化的固有差异（HLV）。本文将分割投票视为自然可观察的人类意见分歧和价值多元主义，并从欧洲人权法院（ECHR）收集法官的投票分布，提出了带有SV信息的案件结果分类（COC）数据集SV-ECHR。我们建立了包含SV特定子类别的不同意见的分类法。我们进一步评估模型和人类之间感知困难的一致性，以及COC模型的置信度和人类校准。我们观察到了限制性的...",
