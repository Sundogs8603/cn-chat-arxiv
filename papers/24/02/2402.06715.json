    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们研究了两层滑雪租赁问题，用户需要通过选择三种支付选项之一：按需使用（即租赁），购买单个项目（即单独购买）和购买所有项目（即组合购买）来满足多个项目的一系列需求。在不了解未来需求的情况下，用户旨在通过平衡高昂的前期成本（购买）和潜在的未来费用（租金）之间的权衡来最小化总成本（即租金、单独购买和组合购买费用之和）。我们首先设计了一种鲁棒的在线算法（RDTSR），该算法提供了最坏情况下的性能保证。虽然在线算法对最坏情况下的场景具有鲁棒性，但在典型情况下往往过于谨慎，导致平均性能较差。另一方面，机器学习（ML）算法通常在各种应用中显示出有希望的平均性能，但缺乏最坏情况的性能。",
