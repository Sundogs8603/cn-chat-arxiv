    "translated_abstract": "轨迹数据对于各种应用非常重要，因为它记录了车辆的移动情况。然而，由于隐私问题，公开可用的轨迹数据集在规模上仍然有限，这阻碍了轨迹数据挖掘和基于轨迹的应用的发展。为了解决这个问题，已经提出了一些生成合成轨迹的方法来扩大数据集的规模。然而，所有现有方法都是在地理坐标系统中生成轨迹，这对于实际应用存在两个限制：1）不能确保生成的轨迹在道路上受到约束。2）缺乏与道路相关的信息。在本文中，我们提出了一个新的问题，即面向实际应用需求的道路网络约束轨迹（RNTraj）生成，它可以直接在道路网络上生成带有道路相关信息的轨迹。RNTraj是一种混合类型的数据，在每个poi上都与时间相关联。",
