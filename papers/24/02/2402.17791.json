Due to the availability of richer data and knowledge, recent research interests of NIE have been dedicating to knowledge graphs for predicting future or missing node importance scores. Existing state-of-the-art NIE methods train the model by available labels, and they consider every interested node equally before training. However, the nodes with higher importance often require or receive more attention in real-world scenarios, e.g., people may care more about the movies or webpages with higher importance. To this end, we introduce Label Informed ContrAstive Pretraining (LICAP) to the NIE problem for being better aware of the nodes with high importance scores. Specifically, LICAP is a novel type of contrastive learning framework that aims to fully utilize the continuous labels to generate contrastive samples for pretraining embeddings. Cons",

    "translated_abstract": "节点重要性估计（NIE）是推断图中节点重要性分数的任务。最近的研究兴趣已经转向知识图谱，用于预测未来或缺失的节点重要性分数，由于数据和知识更为丰富。现有最先进的NIE方法通过可用标签训练模型，并在训练之前平等地考虑每个感兴趣的节点。然而，在现实场景中，更重要的节点通常需要或会得到更多关注，例如，人们可能更关心具有更高重要性的电影或网页。为此，我们引入了标签信息对知识图谱中节点重要性估计问题的对比预训练（LICAP），以更好地了解具有高重要性分数的节点。具体而言，LICAP是一种新颖的对比学习框架，旨在充分利用连续标签生成预训练嵌入的对比样本。",
