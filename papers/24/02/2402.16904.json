    "translated_abstract": "小型推理模型的最新进展促进了人工智能在边缘部署。然而，边缘设备有限的资源特性，特别是对于实时应用程序，带来了新的挑战。部署多个推理模型（或者一个尺寸可调的模型）变化大小，因此准确性和功耗，以及边缘服务器推理模型，可以提供一个动态系统，在其中根据当前资源条件执行对推理模型到推理任务的分配。因此，在这项工作中，我们解决了将推理模型选择性分配给任务或将其卸载到边缘服务器以在时间和能量约束下最大化推理准确性的问题。该问题被证明是无界多维背包问题的一个实例，被认为是一个强 NP-难问题。我们提出了一个轻量级混合遗传算法（LGSTO）来解决此问题。",
