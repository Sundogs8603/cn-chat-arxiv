    "translated_abstract": "学习与误差（LWE）是一种困难的数学问题，是最近标准化的量子后-密码学（PQC）系统中用于密钥交换和数字签名的基础。先前的研究提出了基于机器学习（ML）的攻击方法来攻击具有小型和稀疏密钥的LWE问题，但这些攻击需要数百万个LWE样本进行训练，并且需要几天的时间才能恢复密钥。我们提出了三种关键方法——更好的预处理、角嵌入和模型预训练——来改进这些攻击方法，加快了预处理速度25倍，提高了模型样本效率10倍。我们首次证明了预训练可以改善ML攻击LWE的成本。我们的架构改进使得可以扩展到更大维度的 LWE 问题：这是首次在实践中使用最小维度$n=1024$的同态加密应用中恢复稀疏二进制密钥的 ML 攻击。",
