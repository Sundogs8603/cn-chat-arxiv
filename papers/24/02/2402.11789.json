In this study, we consider a medical diagnostic task using generated images by diffusion models, and propose a statistical test to quantify its reliability. The basic idea behind the proposed statistical test is to employ a selective inference framework, where we consider a statistical test conditional on the fact that the generated images are produced by a trained diffusion model.

    "translated_abstract": "AI的增强性能加速了其融入科学研究。特别是，利用生成式AI创建科学假设是很有前途的，并且正在越来越多地应用于各个领域。然而，当使用AI生成的假设进行关键决策（如医学诊断）时，验证它们的可靠性至关重要。在本研究中，我们考虑使用扩散模型生成的图像进行医学诊断任务，并提出了一种统计检验来量化其可靠性。所提出的统计检验的基本思想是使用选择性推断框架，我们考虑在生成的图像是由经过训练的扩散模型产生的这一事实条件下的统计检验。利用所提出的方法，医学图像诊断结果的统计可靠性可以以p值的形式量化，从而实现在控制错误率的情况下进行决策。",
