    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.18135v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This study aims to empirically investigate the impact of managers' characteristics on their choice between in-court and out-of-court restructuring. Based on the theory of upper echelons, we tested the preferences of 342 managers of financially distressed French firms regarding restructuring decisions. The overall findings of this study provide empirical support for the upper echelons theory. Specifically, managers with a long tenure and those with a high level of education are less likely to restructure before the court and are more likely to restructure privately. The findings also indicate that managers' age and gender do not significantly affect their choice between in-court and out-of-court restructuring. This study contributes to the literature on bankruptcy and corporate restructuring by turning the focus from firm characteristics to manager characteristics to explain restructuring decisions.",

    "translated_abstract": "该研究旨在通过实证研究调查管理者特征对其选择法庭内外重组的影响。基于上层管理团队理论，我们对342家财政困难的法国公司的经理的重组决策偏好进行了测试。本研究的总体发现为上层管理团队理论提供了经验证据。具体来说，任职时间较长和受过高等教育的经理更不愿在法庭前进行重组，更倾向于私下进行重组。研究还表明，经理的年龄和性别并不显著影响他们在法庭内外重组之间的选择。此研究通过将焦点从公司特征转向管理者特征来解释重组决策，为破产和公司重组领域的文献做出了贡献。",

    "en_tdlr": "The study found that managers' tenure and education level influence their tendency to choose between in-court and out-of-court restructuring, while age and gender do not. This research contributes to the literature on bankruptcy and corporate restructuring by focusing on manager characteristics rather than firm characteristics to explain restructuring decisions."
