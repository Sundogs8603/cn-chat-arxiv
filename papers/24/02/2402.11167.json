This study proposes a novel token-ensemble generation strategy to challenge the robustness of current AI-content detection approaches. We explore the ensemble attack strategy by completing the prompt with the next token generated from random candidate LLMs. We find the token-ensemble approach significantly drops the performance of AI-content detection models (The code and test sets will be released). Our findings reveal that token-ensemble generation poses a vital challenge to current detection models and underlines the need for advancing detection technologies to counter sophisticated adversarial strategies.",

    "translated_abstract": "AI内容检测模型对经过精心设计的攻击（例如改写或词语替换）的鲁棒性仍然是一个重要问题。本研究提出了一种新颖的token-ensemble生成策略，挑战了当前AI内容检测方法的鲁棒性。我们通过使用从随机候选语言模型生成的下一个token完成提示来探索集成攻击策略。我们发现token-ensemble方法显著降低了AI内容检测模型的性能（代码和测试集将发布）。我们的发现表明，token-ensemble生成对当前检测模型构成了重要挑战，并强调了改进检测技术以应对复杂对抗策略的需求。",
