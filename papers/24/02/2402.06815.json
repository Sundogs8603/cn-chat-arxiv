    "translated_abstract": "本文引入了大型事件模型（LEMs）在足球分析领域的创新应用，类似于大型语言模型。通过学习足球的“语言” - 预测后续事件的变量而不是单词，LEMs可以模拟比赛并提供各种应用，包括预测不同团队背景下的球员表现。我们专注于使用WyScout数据集对2017-2018英超赛季进行LEMs的精细调整，以获取关于球员贡献和团队战略的具体见解。我们的方法包括调整这些模型以反映足球的微妙动态，从而评估假设的转会。我们的研究结果验证了LEMs在足球分析中的效果和局限性，突显了该模型预测球队预期排名并探索高级场景（例如将Cristiano Ronaldo或Lionel Messi转会至不同球队的潜在影响）的能力。",
