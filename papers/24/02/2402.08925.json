    "translated_abstract": "强化学习从人类反馈中学习(RLHF)通过使用从偏好数据中派生的单一奖励模型来对齐语言模型与人类偏好一致。然而，这种方法忽视了从多个用户收集的数据中固有的人类偏好的丰富多样性。在这项工作中，我们首先推导出了使用单一奖励RLHF进行对齐的不可能性结果，从而凸显了其无法表示多样的人类偏好。为了提供一个公平的解决方案，我们通过期望最大化算法学习了一种混合偏好分布，并提出了一种受社会选择理论中的平等原则启发的MaxMin对齐目标来更好地表示多样的人类偏好。我们阐明了我们提出的方法与分布稳健优化和通用效用RL的联系，从而突显了我们提出的方法的普适性和鲁棒性。",
