However, existing methods often fail to overcome the issue of overconfidence on incorrect answers. In this work, we focus on improving the confidence estimation of large language models. Considering the fragility of self-awareness in language models, we introduce a Multi-Perspective Consistency (MPC) method. We leverage complementary insights from different perspectives within models (MPC-Internal) and across different models (MPC-Across) to mitigate the issue of overconfidence arising from a singular viewpoint. The experimental results on eight publicly available datasets show that our MPC achieves state-of-the-art performance. Further analyses indicate that MPC can mitigate the problem of overconfidence and is effectively scalable to other models.",

    "translated_abstract": "在大型语言模型（LLMs）的部署中，准确的置信度估计对于评估模型预测的可信度至关重要。然而，现有方法经常无法克服对错误答案的过度自信问题。在这项工作中，我们专注于改进大型语言模型的置信度估计。考虑到语言模型中自我意识的脆弱性，我们引入了一种多透视一致性（MPC）方法。我们利用模型内不同透视角度（MPC-Internal）和不同模型之间（MPC-Across）的互补见解来缓解由单一视角产生的过度自信问题。对八个公开数据集的实验结果显示，我们的MPC实现了最先进的性能。进一步的分析表明，MPC能够减轻过度自信问题，并且能够有效扩展到其他模型中。",
