    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.08781v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: I study the problem of a government providing benefits while considering the perceived equity of the resulting allocation. Such concerns are modeled through an equity constraint requiring that equally deserving agents receive equal allocations. I ask what forms of screening are compatible with equity and show that while the government cannot equitably screen with a single instrument (e.g. payments or wait times), combining multiple instruments, which on their own favor different groups, allows it to screen while still producing an equitable allocation.",

    "translated_abstract": "我研究了政府在考虑结果分配的公平性时提供福利的问题。这些关注通过公平性限制来建模，要求应该平等地给予平等值得的代理人分配。我研究了哪些筛选形式与公平相容，并展示了虽然政府无法通过单一工具（如支付或等待时间）进行公平筛选，但将多个工具结合起来，这些工具本身就有利于不同的群体，可以实现筛选同时产生公平的分配。",
