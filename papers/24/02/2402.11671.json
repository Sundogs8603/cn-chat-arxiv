    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11671v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: The project was funded in 2021-2023 by the National Programme of Estonian Language Technology. Its main aim was to develop spelling and grammar correction tools for the Estonian language. The main challenge was the very small amount of available error correction data needed for such development. To mitigate this, (1) we annotated more correction data for model training and testing, (2) we tested transfer-learning, i.e. retraining machine learning models created for other tasks, so as not to depend solely on correction data, (3) we compared the developed method and model with alternatives, including large language models. We also developed automatic evaluation, which can calculate the accuracy and yield of corrections by error category, so that the effectiveness of different methods can be compared in detail.   There has been a breakthrough in large language models during the project: GPT4, a commercial language model with Estonian-lang",

    "translated_abstract": "该项目由爱沙尼亚语言技术国家计划于2021-2023年资助，旨在为爱沙尼亚语开发拼写和语法校正工具。主要挑战是缺乏所需用于此类开发的可用错误校正数据量非常小。为了缓解这一问题，(1) 我们为模型训练和测试注释了更多的校正数据，(2) 我们测试了迁移学习，即重新训练为其他任务创建的机器学习模型，以便不仅依赖于校正数据，(3) 我们对比了开发的方法和模型与其他选择，包括大型语言模型。我们还开发了自动评估，可以通过错误类别计算修正的准确性和收益，从而可以详细比较不同方法的有效性。",
