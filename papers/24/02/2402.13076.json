This study delves into how weight parameters in speech recognition models influence the overall power consumption of these models. We discovered that the impact of weight parameters on power consumption varies, influenced by factors including how often they are invoked and their placement in memory. Armed with this insight, we developed design guidelines aimed at optimizing on-device speech recognition models. These guidelines focus on minimizing power use without substantially affecting accuracy. Our method, which employs targeted compression based on the varying sensitivities of weight parameters, demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art compression methods.
