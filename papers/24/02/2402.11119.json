    "translated_abstract": "我们继续研究不同ially private PAC学习的计算复杂性，以及它在机器学习基础中的定位。最近的一系列工作揭示了私有PAC模型与Littlestone的错误界在线学习模型之间的定性等价性，特别是展示了任何Littlestone维度为$d$的概念类都可以使用$\\mathrm{poly}(d)$个样本来进行私有PAC学习。这引发了一个自然问题，即是否可能从在线学习者转换为私有PAC学习者，并且还能保持计算效率。我们在合理的加密假设下（大致来自于可以为所有电路构建不可区分混淆的假设）对这个问题给出了否定答案。我们展示了一个概念类，可以接受在多项式时间内运行且具有多项式错误界限的在线学习器，但对于这样一个概念类，不存在",
