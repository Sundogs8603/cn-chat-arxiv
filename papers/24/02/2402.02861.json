    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一类零和游戏的实例，其中一位玩家（领导者）承诺对手（追随者）通过对给定概率测度（策略）进行采样来选择行动。领导者的行动由追随者作为任意信道的输出观察到。作为回应，追随者根据其当前信息选择行动，即领导者的承诺和相应行动的嘈杂观察。在这种情况下，证明了带有嘈杂行动可观测性的博弈总是存在均衡，并且确定了其唯一性的必要条件。有趣的是，嘈杂观察对追随者的最佳响应集合的基数有重要影响。在特定条件下，这样的最佳响应集合几乎必然是单例集。所提出的模型可以捕捉到与勒贝格测度相对的任何信道噪声。作为例子，考虑了信道噪声与Lebesgue测度的密度有关的情况。",
