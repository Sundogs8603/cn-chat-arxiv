    "translated_abstract": "语义分割是在人工智能和机器人技术中实现鲁棒图像理解的关键前提。尤其是在训练样本有限的挑战性条件下，少样本分割是传统分割方法的扩展和优化。在少样本分割中，主要的方法是依靠单一的主干网络进行视觉特征提取。选择使用哪个主干网络是影响整体性能的决定因素。在这项工作中，我们探究了从不同主干网络融合特征是否能够提高少样本分割模型捕捉更丰富的视觉特征的能力。为了解决这个问题，我们提出并比较了两种集成技术——独立投票和特征融合。在现有的少样本分割方法中，我们在PANet上实现了提出的集成技术。在PANet中，用于预测分割掩码的模块避免了可训练参数。",
