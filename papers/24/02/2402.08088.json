    "translated_abstract": "背景：机器学习（ML）方法往往在数据偏离其训练分布时失效。这对于临床环境中的ML设备来说是一个重要的问题，因为数据漂移可能导致意外的性能下降，危及患者安全。方法：我们提出了一种基于ML的统计过程控制（SPC）框架，用于离群数据检测和漂移监测。SPC优势在于能够直观地和统计上突出显示与预期分布的偏差。为了证明所提出的框架在放射学图像的数据漂移监测中的实用性，我们考察了不同的设计选择，包括特征提取方法、漂移量化和SPC参数选择等。结果：我们展示了我们的框架在两个任务中的有效性：1）区分轴向与非轴向的计算机断层摄影（CT）图像；2）将胸部X光（CXR）与其他模态进行分离。",
