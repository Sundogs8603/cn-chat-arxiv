The speed of mixing, however, affects the former quantity implying a phase transition. Fast mixing leads to the standard root-n concentration rate, while slow mixing leads to a slower concentration rate, its speed depends on the mixing structure.

    "translated_abstract": "本文针对具有任意混合率的一般混合随机过程提供了一个样本均值的上确界的界限。无论混合的速度如何，该界限由一个集中速率和一种新颖的复杂度度量组成。然而，混合的速度影响前者的数量，意味着出现了相变。快速混合导致标准的根号n集中速率，而慢速混合导致较慢的集中速率，其速度取决于混合结构。我们的发现应用于推导具有任意混合率的一般混合过程的强逼近结果。",
