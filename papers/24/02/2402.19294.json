    "translated_abstract": "操作单元经常在复杂系统中经历各种故障模式，导致不同的降解路径。依赖于在单一故障模式上训练的预测模型可能会导致跨多个故障模式的泛化性能较差。因此，准确识别故障模式至关重要。当前的预测方法要么在降解过程中忽略故障模式，要么假定已知的故障模式标签，而在实践中获得这些标签可能具有挑战性。此外，传感器信号的高维度和复杂关系使得准确识别故障模式具有挑战性。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的故障模式诊断方法，利用一种名为UMAP（Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection）的降维技术将每个单元的降解轨迹投影和可视化到较低维度。然后，利用这些降解轨迹，我们发展了",
