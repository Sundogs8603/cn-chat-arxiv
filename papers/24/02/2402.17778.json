    "translated_abstract": "超宽带（Ultra-wideband，UWB）作为一种有望实现接触性服务的解决方案，如UWB无标签门（UTG），得益于基于下行到达时间差（DL-TDoA）和双边双向测距（DS-TWR）等两种不同测距方法提供的厘米级定位精度，正在崛起。UTG是一种基于UWB的接触性服务，提供无需实时移动设备（MD）敲击即可实现的无缝门禁系统。MD的位置通过DL-TDoA计算，并通过DS-TWR与最近的UTG通信以打开大门。因此，MD的准确位置是UTG面临的主要挑战，因此我们提供了针对DL-TDoA和DS-TWR的解决方案。在本文中，我们提出了极其准确的DL-TDoA定位的动态锚点选择方法和DS-TWR的姿态预测，称为DynaPose。姿态定义为MD在人体上的实际位置，影响着...",
