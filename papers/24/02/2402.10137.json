However, the creation of high-quality annotated data for Task-Oriented Dialog~(TOD) is recognized to be slow and costly. To address these challenges, we introduce Task-Oriented Automatic Dialogs~(TOAD), a novel and scalable TOD dataset along with its automatic generation pipeline. The TOAD dataset simulates realistic app context interaction and provide a variety of system response style options. Two aspects of system response styles are considered, verbosity level and users' expression mirroring. We benchmark TOAD on two response generation tasks and the results show that modeling more verbose or responses without user expression mirroring is more challenging.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近大语言模型（LLM）的进展显示，下一代虚拟助手的期望包括在各种使用场景下提供更加自然和适应性强的对话能力。然而，为面向任务的对话（TOD）创建高质量的标注数据被认为是缓慢和昂贵的。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了任务导向的自动对话系统（TOAD），这是一个新颖且可扩展的TOD数据集，以及与之配套的自动生成流程。TOAD数据集模拟了真实的应用上下文交互，并提供了各种系统响应风格选项。考虑了系统响应风格的两个方面，即冗长程度和用户表达镜像。我们在两个响应生成任务上进行了TOAD的评估，结果显示建模更冗长的回复或不进行用户表达镜像的回复更具挑战性。",
