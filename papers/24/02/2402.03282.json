    "translated_abstract": "最近几年来，强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）的研究因其在LLMs的发展中起到的作用而变得重要。神经科学研究表明，人类对刺激的反应已知依赖于部分观察到的“内部状态”。不幸的是，当前的RLHF模型没有考虑到这一点。此外，大多数RLHF模型没有考虑到中间反馈，在实证研究中变得越来越重要，可以帮助提高样本复杂性和对齐性。为了解决这些局限性，我们将RLHF建模为部分观察到的奖励状态的强化学习（PORRL）。我们展示了从RLHF中两种主要形式的人类反馈 - 基数反馈和决斗反馈到PORRL的缩减。对于基数反馈，我们开发了通用的统计高效算法，并将它们实例化为POR-UCRL和POR-UCBVI。对于决斗反馈，我们表明，简单的基数反馈缩减不能达到亚线性的决斗回归。",
