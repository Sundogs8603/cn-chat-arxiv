We collected a real product price dataset, AmazonHistoryPrice, and conducted evaluations of various LLM agents' bargaining abilities. We find that playing a Buyer is much harder than a Seller, and increasing model size can not effectively improve the Buyer's performance.

    "translated_abstract": "谈判是人类之间谈判的一个重要且独特的部分。随着基于LLM的代理学习谈判并表现得像真正的人类一样，如何评估代理的谈判能力仍然是一个悬而未决的问题。我们第一次将谈判任务形式化描述为一种不完全信息的不对称游戏，定义了买方和卖方在多次谈判过程中的收益，使我们能够定量评估一个代理在谈判任务中的表现。我们收集了一个真实产品价格数据集AmazonHistoryPrice，并对各种LLM代理的谈判能力进行了评估。我们发现扮演买方比扮演卖方要困难得多，并且增加模型大小无法有效地提高买方的表现。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种称为OG-Narrator的新方法，该方法集成了一个确定性的报价生成器来控制买方报价的价格范围，并且集成了一个LLM解说者来创建一种自然",
