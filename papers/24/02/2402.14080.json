Conformal Prediction has emerged as a promising method to pair machine learning models with prediction intervals, allowing for a view of the model's uncertainty.

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型正在被应用于各种关键决策任务，然而它们被训练为提供点预测而没有提供信心度。如果与不确定性估计结合，深度学习模型的可信度可以得到提高。置信预测已经被证明是一种有希望的方法，可以将机器学习模型与预测区间配对，从而可以看到模型的不确定性。然而，常见的用于置信预测的不确定性估计方法未能提供对所有样本同样准确的异方差间隔。本文提出了一种方法，通过从深度回归森林获得的方差来估计每个样本的不确定性。我们展示了深度回归森林的方差如何提高药物反应预测任务上规范化诱导置信预测的效率和覆盖率。",
