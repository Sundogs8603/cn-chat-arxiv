    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(Large language models, LLMs)能够生成类似人类的文本，但也引发了人们对其在虚假新闻和学术不诚实方面的担忧。解码为基础的水印，尤其是基于GumbelMax技巧的水印(GM水印)，是防范机器生成文本滥用的杰出解决方案，因其显著的可检测性而脱颖而出。然而，GM水印在生成多样性方面面临一个主要挑战，对于相同提示始终产生相同输出，从而负面影响生成多样性和用户体验。为了克服这一局限，我们提出了一种新型GM水印，即Logits-Addition水印，及其三个变体，专门设计用于增强多样性。在这些变体中，GumbelSoft水印(作为Logits-Addition水印的一个softmax变体)在高多样性环境中表现出优越性能，其AUROC分数超过其他两个替代变体0.1至0.3，并超越其他方案。",
