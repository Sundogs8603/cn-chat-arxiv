    "title": "Spillover Effects of US Monetary Policy on Emerging Markets Amidst Uncertainty",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the impact of US monetary policy tightening on emerging markets, distinguishing between direct and indirect spillover effects using the global vector autoregression with stochastic volatility covering 32 countries. The paper demonstrates that an increase in the US interest rate significantly reduces output for emerging markets, leading to larger, more prolonged, and persistent declines. Such an impact is further intensified by global trade integration, causing a sharper yet slightly quicker rebounding output drop. The spillover effects are significantly amplified when US monetary policy tightening is accompanied by an increase in monetary policy uncertainty. Finally, emerging markets exhibit considerable heterogeneity in their responses to US monetary policy shocks.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文利用全球向量自回归模型和随机波动率，研究美国货币政策紧缩对新兴市场的影响，区分了直接和间接的溢出效应。研究结果表明，美国利率的上升显著降低新兴市场的产出，导致较大、较长和持久的下降。全球贸易一体化进一步增强了这种影响，导致产出下降更加剧烈但稍微更快地回弹。当美国货币政策紧缩伴随着货币政策不确定性的增加时，溢出效应显著放大。最后，新兴市场对美国货币政策冲击的反应存在显著的异质性。",
