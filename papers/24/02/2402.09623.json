Prompted by the need for dependable uncertainty estimates in motion planning applications where the behavior of diverse objects may be more or less unpredictable, we blend different techniques from online conformal prediction of single and multiple time series, as well as ideas for addressing heteroscedasticity in regression. This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新的符合性方法，用于生成同时预测边界，以具有足够高的概率覆盖新随机轨迹的整个路径。鉴于在运动规划应用中需要可靠的不确定性估计，其中不同物体的行为可能更或更少可预测，我们将来自单个和多个时间序列的在线符合性预测技术，以及解决回归中的异方差性的方法进行了融合。该解决方案既有原则性，提供了精确的有限样本保证，又有效，通常比先前的方法具有更丰富的预测结果。",
