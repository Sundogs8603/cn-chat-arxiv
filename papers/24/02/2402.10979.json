    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.10979v1 公告类型：交叉 摘要：大型语言模型对于整合文本文档和数据库记录等各种数据类型进行先进分析具有重要潜力。然而，融合文本和数值数据存在重大挑战。LLMs需要处理和交叉引用实体和数字，处理数据不一致性和冗余，并发展规划能力，比如构建用于管理复杂数据查询的工作内存。在本文中，我们介绍了围绕体育数据分析的四项新颖任务，以评估LLMs的数值推理和信息融合能力。这些任务涉及向LLMs提供详细的逐场比赛描述，然后在面对诸如新比赛规则、更长持续时间、故事混乱以及分析比赛摘要中的关键统计数据等对抗性场景。我们对NBA和NFL比赛进行了大量实验，以评估LLMs在该领域的表现。",
