    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱嵌入（KGE）模型在许多知识图谱任务，包括链接预测和信息检索方面取得了最先进的结果。尽管KGE模型在实践中表现出优越性能，但我们发现一些流行的现有KGE模型存在表达不足的问题，称为“Z-悖论”。受到Z-悖论的存在的启发，我们提出了一种新的KGE模型，称为MQuinE，在不受Z-悖论的困扰的同时，保持强大的表达能力来模拟各种关系模式，包括对称/非对称，逆向，1-N/N-1/N-N和组合关系，并提供了理论上的证明。对实际知识库的实验表明，Z-悖论确实降低了现有KGE模型的性能，并且可能导致某些具有挑战性的测试样本的准确性下降超过20％。我们的实验进一步证明了MQuinE可以减轻Z-悖论的负面影响，并在链接预测方面以明显优势超越现有的KGE模型。",
