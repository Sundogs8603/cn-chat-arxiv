    "translated_abstract": "在燃油汽车统治交通领域一个多世纪后，由于一系列优势，包括更低运营成本和更低的CO2排放，电动汽车似乎即将得到推广。通过使用车辆到电网（如果使用电动汽车作为负荷，则为电网到车辆）的方法，电动汽车可以同时作为负荷和源进行运行。主频率调节和拥塞管理是该技术添加到工业微电网中的两个重要特性。工业微电网由不同的能源源，如风电场和光伏电场，储能系统和负载组成。电动汽车由于其快速调节能力而作为频率管理技术引起了很大的兴趣。电网可靠性取决于这种快速反应。本研究考虑了不同的事故，电动汽车的电池状态和电动汽车队中电动汽车的数量的变化，并提出了一种用于主频率控制的控制方案。",
