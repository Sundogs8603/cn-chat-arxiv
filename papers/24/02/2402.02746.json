    "translated_abstract": "长期以来，人们普遍认为使用标准 Gaussian 过程（GP）进行贝叶斯优化（BO），即标准 BO，在高维优化问题中效果不佳。这种观念可以部分归因于 Gaussian 过程在协方差建模和函数估计中对高维输入的困难。虽然这些担忧看起来合理，但缺乏支持这种观点的经验证据。本文系统地研究了在各种合成和真实世界基准问题上，使用标准 GP 回归进行高维优化的贝叶斯优化。令人惊讶的是，标准 GP 的表现始终位于最佳范围内，往往比专门为高维优化设计的现有 BO 方法表现更好。与刻板印象相反，我们发现标准 GP 可以作为学习高维目标函数的能力强大的代理。在没有强结构假设的情况下，使用标准 GP 进行 BO 可以获得非常好的性能。",
