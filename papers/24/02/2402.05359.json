    "translated_abstract": "基础模型，如大型语言模型（LLMs），因其广泛的应用而引起了广泛的关注。现有的研究表明，适当的提示设计，如思维链，可以释放LLM在不同领域的强大能力。然而，对于处理涉及重复子任务和/或具有欺骗性内容的任务（如算术计算和文章级虚假新闻检测），现有的提示策略要么表现出表达能力不足，要么由幻觉引发中间错误。为了使LLM对这些中间错误更具辨别力，我们提出了一种以分治程序引导LLM的方法，同时确保优越的表达能力和任务分解、子任务解决和解决组装过程的分离。理论分析表明，我们的策略可以引导LLM扩展固定深度Transformer的表达能力。实验表明，我们提出的方法可以实现",
