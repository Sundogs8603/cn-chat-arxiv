This paper introduces cooperative language-guided inverse plan search (CLIPS), a Bayesian agent architecture for pragmatic instruction following and goal assistance. Our agent assists a human by modeling them as a cooperative planner who communicates joint plans to the assistant, then performs multimodal Bayesian inference over the human's goal from actions and language, using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the likelihood of an instruction given a hypothesized plan.

    "translated_abstract": "人们经常给出在缺乏进一步上下文的情况下意义模糊的指令，期望他们的行动或目标能消除不明确的意图。我们如何构建能够以灵活、与上下文相关的方式遵循这类指令的辅助代理呢？本文介绍了一种名为合作语言引导逆向计划搜索（CLIPS）的贝叶斯代理架构，用于实现实用指令跟随和目标辅助。我们的代理通过将人类建模为一个合作规划者，将共同计划与助手进行通信，然后通过动作和语言执行多模态贝叶斯推断，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）评估在假设计划下给出的指令的可能性。在获得这一后验分布后，我们的助手通过行动来最小化期望目标实现成本，使其能够实用地遵循含糊的指令，并即使在对指令不确定时也能提供有效的辅助。",
