This study provides an in-depth analysis of the distribution and types of noise in the widely used BIRD-Bench benchmark and the impact of noise on models. While BIRD-Bench was created to model dirty and noisy database values, it was not created to contain noise and errors in the questions and gold queries. We found that noise in questions and gold queries are prevalent in the dataset, with varying amounts across domains, and with an uneven distribution between noise types.

    "translated_abstract": "Text-to-SQL涉及将自然语言翻译为结构化查询语言（SQL），对于使结构化数据库可以在没有专业知识的情况下得到广泛访问至关重要。然而，设计针对这些任务的模型是具有挑战性的，原因包括存在“噪声”，如模糊问题和语法错误。该研究对广泛使用的BIRD-Bench基准测试中噪声的分布和类型以及噪声对模型的影响进行了深入分析。虽然BIRD-Bench旨在模拟脏乱和嘈杂的数据库值，但并未包含问题和标准查询中的噪声和错误。我们发现数据集中问题和标准查询中的噪声普遍存在，跨领域存在不同程度的噪声，并且噪声类型之间分布不均匀。存在不正确的标准SQL查询，进而生成不正确的标准答案，对基准测试的影响显著。",
