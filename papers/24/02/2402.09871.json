To this end, we present MuChin, the first open-source music description benchmark in Chinese colloquial language, designed to evaluate the performance of multimodal LLMs in understanding and describing music.

    "translated_abstract": "快速发展的多模态大型语言模型（LLMs）迫切需要新的基准来统一评估它们在理解和以文字描述音乐方面的性能。然而，由于音乐信息检索（MIR）算法与人类理解之间的语义差距，专业人士和公众之间的差异，以及注释的低精度，现有的音乐描述数据集无法作为基准。为此，我们提出了MuChin，这是第一个用中文口语描述的开源音乐描述基准，旨在评估多模态LLMs在理解和描述音乐方面的性能。我们建立了采虫音乐注释平台（CaiMAP），采用创新的多人、多阶段保证方法，并招募了业余爱好者和专业人士，以确保注释的精度和与流行语义的对齐。利用这种方法，我们构建了一个数据集。",
