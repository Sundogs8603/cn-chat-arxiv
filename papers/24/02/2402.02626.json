Document-specific historical click-through rates can be important features in a dynamic ranking system which updates as we accumulate more sample. This paper describes the properties of several such features, and tests them in controlled experiments. Extending the inverse propensity weighting method to documents creates an unbiased estimate of document relevance. This feature can approximate relevance accurately, leading to near-optimal ranking in ideal circumstances. However, it has high variance that is increasing with respect to the degree of position bias. Furthermore, inaccurate position bias estimation leads to poor performance. Under several scenarios this feature can perform worse than biased click-through rates. This paper underscores the need for accurate position bias estimation, and is unique in suggesting simultaneous use of biased and unbiased position bias features.",

    "translated_abstract": "搜索引擎中建模文件相关性的目的是在后续搜索中更好地排名。文档特定的历史点击率可以作为动态排名系统中的重要特征，随着我们积累更多样本，系统会进行更新。本文描述了几种这样的特征的属性，并在控制实验中对其进行了测试。将反向倾向加权方法扩展到文档上可以产生对文档相关性的无偏估计。这个特征可以准确地近似相关性，在理想情况下可以实现接近最优的排名。然而，它具有高方差，且随着位置偏差的程度增加而增加。此外，不准确的位置偏差估计会导致性能不佳。在几种情况下，这个特征的表现可能不如偏倚的点击率。本文强调了准确的位置偏差估计的必要性，并独特地建议同时使用有偏和无偏的位置偏差特征。",
