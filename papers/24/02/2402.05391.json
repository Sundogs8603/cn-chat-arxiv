    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱在推动各种人工智能应用方面起着关键作用，语义网络社区对多模态维度的探索为创新打开了新的途径。在本综述中，我们仔细审查了300多篇文章，重点关注了两个主要方面的知识图谱感知研究：以知识图谱支持多模态任务的KG驱动多模态（KG4MM）学习，将知识图谱研究扩展到多模态知识图谱（MM4KG）领域。我们从定义知识图谱和多模态知识图谱开始，然后探索它们的构建进展。我们的综述包括两个主要任务类别：KG感知的多模态学习任务，如图像分类和视觉问答，以及内在的多模态知识图谱任务，如多模态知识图谱补全和实体对齐，突出了具体的研究轨迹。对于这些任务中的大部分，我们提供了定义、评估基准，并进一步指出进行相关研究的重要见解。最后，我们讨论了cu",
