In this work, we provide strong theoretical justification for this phenomenon: for commonly-used groups, there is no efficiently computable choice of frame that preserves continuity of the function being averaged.

    "translated_abstract": "规范化提供了一种与架构无关的方法来强制保持等变性，近期广受关注的泛化方法如框架平均化成为一种轻量且灵活的等变架构替代方案。 最近的研究发现，使用概率框架能够带来实证效益，这些框架学习群元素上的加权分布。 本文提供了关于这一现象的强有力理论证据：对于常用的群，没有有效的可计算的框架选择能够保持被平均函数的连续性。 换句话说，非加权的框架平均可以将一个平滑的、非对称的函数转变为一个不连续、对称的函数。 为了解决这一基本的鲁棒性问题，我们正式定义并构建了\\emph{加权}框架，据证明能够保持连续性，并通过构建高效连续的加权框架展示了它们的实用性。",
