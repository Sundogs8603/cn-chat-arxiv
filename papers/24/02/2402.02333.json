    "translated_abstract": "近年来，生成型人工智能（Generative AI）取得了快速发展，扩展了其创建文本、图像、音频和代码等合成内容的能力。这些深度生成模型（Deep Generative Models，DGMs）生成的内容高保真度和真实性引发了重大的版权问题。关于如何有效保护DGMs中的版权问题，已经进行了各种法律辩论。本文从技术角度提供了版权保护的全面概述。我们从两个不同的视角来进行研究：一是与数据所有者所持有的源数据相关的版权，二是与模型构建者所维护的生成模型相关的版权。对于数据版权，我们深入探讨了数据所有者如何保护其内容，并在不侵犯这些权利的情况下使用DGMs。对于模型版权，我们的讨论延伸到防止模型盗窃和识别特定模型生成的输出的策略。最后，我们强调了一些创新的方法和技术来处理这些版权问题。",
