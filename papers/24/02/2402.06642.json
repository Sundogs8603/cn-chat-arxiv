    "translated_abstract": "波动率作为不确定性的度量，在风险管理等众多金融活动中扮演着至关重要的角色。计量经济学和机器学习界已经发展出了两种不同的金融波动率预测方法：随机方法和神经网络（NN）方法。尽管它们各自具有优势，但这些方法通常在不同的研究轨迹中发展，相互之间有很少的交互。本研究通过建立GARCH家族模型和相应的神经网络模型之间的等价关系来弥合这一差距。通过建立等价关系，我们引入了一种创新的方法，名为GARCH-NN，用于构建基于神经网络的波动率模型。它获取GARCH模型的神经网络对应模型，并将其作为组件整合到已建立的神经网络结构中，从而将GARCH模型中固有的波动率风格化事实（SFs）无缝融入到神经网络中。",
