We present a self-supervised approach with HuBERT, enabling the accurate classification of phoneme labels and the identification of vocal patterns that suggest a rudimentary vocabulary within dog vocalizations. Our findings indicate a significant acoustic consistency in these identified canine vocabulary, covering the entirety of observed dog vocalization sequences. We further develop a web-based dog vocalization labeling system. This system can highlight phoneme n-grams, present in the vocabulary, in the dog audio uploaded by users.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文深入探讨了在犬叫声中潜在沟通模式的开创性探索，并超越了传统的语言分析障碍，大量依赖于人类先验知识和有限数据集来发现狗的叫声中的声音单元。我们提出了一种自监督方法，利用HuBERT实现了声素标签的准确分类，并识别了暗示犬叫声中一种基础词汇的声音模式。我们的研究结果表明，这些确定的犬词汇中存在显著的声学一致性，覆盖了所有观察到的犬叫声序列。我们进一步开发了一个基于Web的犬叫声标记系统。该系统可以在用户上传的狗叫声中突出显示词汇中存在的声素n-gram。",
