    "translated_abstract": "理解非结构化文本数据集一直是困难的，但随着大型语言模型的出现变得越来越重要。数据工作人员常常依赖于数据集摘要，特别是各种派生特征的分布。一些特征，如毒性或主题，对许多数据集都有影响，但许多有趣的特征是特定于领域的：音乐数据集的乐器和流派，或医学数据集的疾病和症状。因此，数据工作者经常为每个数据集运行自定义分析，这既繁琐又困难。我们提出了AutoHistograms，这是一个利用LLM的可视化工具。AutoHistograms自动识别相关特征，用直方图形式展示它们，并允许用户交互式地查询数据集的实体类别并创建新的直方图。在与10名数据工作者（n=10）进行的用户研究中，我们发现参与者可以快速利用AutoHistograms识别见解并探索数据。",
