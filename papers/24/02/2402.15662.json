    "translated_abstract": "在计算机视觉领域，深度卷积神经网络已经被证明能成功识别面部情绪多年。然而，现有的检测方法并不总是可靠或可解释，我们在这里提出了我们的模型GiMeFive，通过层激活和梯度加权类激活映射进行解释。我们与最先进的方法进行比较，以对六种面部情绪进行分类。实证结果表明，在两个面部情感识别（FER）基准和我们的汇总FER GiMeFive方面，我们的模型在准确性上优于先前的方法。此外，我们在真实图像和视频示例中解释了我们的工作，以及实时直播摄像头流。我们的代码和补充材料可在 https：//github.com/werywjw/SEP-CVDL 找到。",
