This scarcity underscores the need for innovative solutions, particularly in enhancing the accessibility and efficacy of therapeutic support. Embodied agents with advanced interactive capabilities emerge as a promising and cost-effective supplement to traditional caregiving methods. Crucial to these agents' effectiveness is their ability to simulate non-verbal behaviors, like backchannels, that are pivotal in establishing rapport and understanding in therapeutic contexts but remain under-explored. To improve the rapport-building capabilities of embodied agents we annotated backchannel smiles in videos of intimate face-to-face conversations over topics such as mental health, illness, and relationships. We hypothesized that both speaker and listener behaviors affect the duration and intensity of back",

    "translated_abstract": "针对心理健康资源不足的问题，有效的筛查、诊断和治疗仍然是一个重大挑战。这种稀缺性突显了创新解决方案的需求，特别是在增强治疗支持的可及性和有效性方面。拥有先进互动能力的体验式代理呈现出有望成为传统护理方法的有力补充品，并且低成本。这些代理的有效性在于它们能够模拟非言语行为，如回应微笑，在治疗场景中建立融洽和理解的关键作用，但目前尚未深入研究。为了提高体验式代理的建立融洽能力，我们对面对面亲密对话的视频中的回应微笑进行了注释，这些对话涉及心理健康、疾病和人际关系等主题。我们假设讲话者和听众的行为都会影响回应微笑的持续时间和强度。",
