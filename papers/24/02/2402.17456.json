    "translated_abstract": "研究发现，网络欺凌危害青少年的心理健康，教授他们正确的干预方法至关重要。巫师-奥兹研究表明，聊天机器人可以扩展个性化和互动式的网络欺凌教育，但实施这样的聊天机器人是一项具有挑战性和微妙的任务。我们为 K-12 教师创建了一个无代码聊天机器人设计工具。通过使用大型语言模型和提示链条，我们的工具允许教师原型化定制的对话流程和聊天机器人话语。通过提供这个工具，我们探讨了教师在设计聊天机器人以辅助他们的教学时的独特需求，以及聊天机器人设计工具如何更好地支持他们。我们的研究结果表明，教师热情地接受这个工具。此外，他们将自己视为指导学生和聊天机器人行为的剧作家，同时允许一些即兴演出。他们的目标是使学生能够排练对网络欺凌的理想和不良反应。",
