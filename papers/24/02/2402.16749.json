    "translated_abstract": "随着存储和通信协议的演变，超低比特率图像压缩已成为一个极具需求的话题。然而，现有的压缩算法必须在超低比特率下要么牺牲与真实数据的一致性，要么牺牲感知质量。近年来，大型多模态模型（LMM）的快速发展使得平衡这两个目标变得可能。为解决这一问题，本文提出了一种称为多模态图像语义压缩（MISC）的方法，包括一个LMM编码器用于提取图像的语义信息、一个地图编码器用于定位与语义对应的区域、一个图像编码器生成极度压缩的比特流，以及一个解码器根据上述信息重构图像。实验结果表明，我们提出的MISC适用于压缩传统自然感知图像（NSIs）和新兴AI生成图像。",
