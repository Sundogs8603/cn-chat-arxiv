    "translated_abstract": "现代计算密集型应用通常在时间约束下操作，需要加速方法并将计算工作负载分布到多个实体上。然而，结果要么在所需时间内达到，要么没有，并且在后一种情况下，宝贵的资源被浪费。在本文中，我们引入了分层分辨率计算的解决方案。这些解决方案允许在最终结果之前的早期阶段获得较低分辨率的结果。这种创新显著增强了基于截止日期的系统，因为如果由于时间限制而终止计算任务，则仍可以生成最终结果的近似版本。此外，在某些操作模式下，高分辨率的结果可能是不必要的，因为低分辨率的结果可能已经与决策阈值显著偏离，例如在基于人工智能的决策系统中。因此，操作人员可以决定是否需要更高的分辨率。",
