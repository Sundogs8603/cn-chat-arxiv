    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）为材料科学中的强大语言处理工具提供了令人兴奋的可能性，加快了材料研究的进展。然而，LLMs在实际应用中仍存在不足，无法成为实用的材料科学工具。本文通过展示LLMs在材料科学中的相关失败案例，揭示了LLMs在理解和推理复杂、相互关联的材料科学知识方面的现有限制。鉴于这些缺点，我们提出了一种开发基于材料科学知识和假设生成与测试的材料科学LLMs（MatSci-LLMs）的框架。实现高性能的MatSci-LLMs的路径在很大程度上取决于建立高质量的多模态数据集，这些数据集来自科学文献，其中存在各种信息提取挑战。因此，我们描述了关键的材料科学信息提取挑战。",
