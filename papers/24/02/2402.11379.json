At its heart is a first-order vector autoregression that is grounded in linear filtering theory as the cross-section grows large. The result is a fast, simple and robust algorithm for computing an approximate likelihood that can be easily paired with standard classical or Bayesian methods. Importantly, our method is compatible with the popular sequence-space solution method, unlike existing state-of-the-art approaches. We test-drive our method by estimating a canonical HANK model with shocks in both the aggregate and cross-section. Not only do simulation results demonstrate the appeal of our method, they also emphasize the important information contained in the entire micro-level distribution over and above simple moments.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种利用间接推断策略来估计具有微观数据的异质代理商业周期模型。其核心是一个一阶向量自回归，它基于线性滤波理论，在截面不断增大时成立。结果是一种快速、简单和稳健的算法，可以轻松地与标准的经典或贝叶斯方法配对。重要的是，我们的方法与流行的序列空间解法方法兼容，不同于现有的最先进方法。我们通过估计具有汇总和截面冲击的经典HANK模型来测试我们的方法。仿真结果不仅证明了我们方法的吸引力，也强调了整个微观层级分布中包含的重要信息，远远超出简单时刻的范围。",
