    "translated_abstract": "在COVID-19疫苗分配中，易受影响的亚人群在健康和接种疫苗准入方面更具劣势。为此，我们系统地形式化和研究了在存在与优势和劣势相关的固有准入差异的情况下的资源分配问题。我们确定减少资源差异是这一背景下的关键目标，并展示了其作为更细致的下游影响的代理。我们开发了一个具体的准入模型，帮助量化给定分配对于有利地区和不利地区的资源流转的影响，该模型基于它们之间的准入差距。然后，我们提供了一个准入感知的分配方法。直观上讲，由此产生的分配利用更多疫苗分配给易受损人群更多的地区，以减少准入差距和整体差异。令人惊讶的是，通常不需要了解准入差距就可以执行准入感知的分配。为了支持这个形式化的方法，我们所提出的具体建模和方法能够实现平衡公平性和效率性。",

Experimental results show that this approach can effectively reduce resource disparity even without knowledge of the access gap."
