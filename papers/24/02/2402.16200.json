    "translated_abstract": "有效地在训练数据有限的情况下进行信息检索（IR），特别是对于复杂查询，仍然是一项具有挑战性的任务。本文介绍了IR2，即信息检索的信息正则化，一种用于在合成数据生成过程中减少过拟合的技术。该方法在具有复杂查询特征的三个最近的IR任务上进行了测试：DORIS-MAE、ArguAna和WhatsThatBook。实验结果表明，我们的正则化技术不仅在所考虑的任务上优于先前的合成查询生成方法，而且还能将成本降低高达50％。此外，本文将不同阶段的三种正则化方法——输入、提示和输出进行了分类和探索，每种方法相对于没有正则化的模型均提供了不同程度的性能改进。",
