    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了使用ReLU-like激活函数以经验平方损失训练的单隐藏层神经网络的损失景观。由于激活函数是不可微的，目前还不清楚如何完全描述稳定点。我们提出了适用于非可微和可微情况的稳定点条件。此外，我们还展示了如果一个稳定点不包含“逃逸神经元”（通过一阶条件定义），那么它必定是一个局部最小值。此外，在标量输出情况下，逃逸神经元的存在保证了稳定点不是局部最小值。我们的结果进一步描述了从无穷小（消失）初始化开始的浅层ReLU-like网络的鞍点到鞍点的训练过程，直接将鞍点逃逸与逃逸神经元的参数变化联系起来。此外，我们还完全讨论了网络嵌入的方式。",
