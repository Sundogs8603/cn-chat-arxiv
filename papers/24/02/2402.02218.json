    "translated_abstract": "在过去的5年里，非洲国家中大规模音频数据集的可用性为构建距离人们更近、使用本地语言进行交流、学习、理解和开展业务的机器智能（MI）技术提供了无限机会，包括那些无法读写的人。然而，这些音频数据集并没有被现有的MI工具充分利用，使得许多非洲人错失了MI业务机会。此外，许多先进的MI模型并没有意识到文化差异，其采纳指数的伦理问题也值得质疑。这一缺失在非洲的许多应用中是一个重大障碍。本文以多层多尺度和文化意识伦理的视角总结了非洲机器智能的最新发展，通过400篇关于MI研究、产业、政府行动以及艺术、音乐、非正式经济和非洲小企业应用的文章，展示了MI在54个非洲国家的应用案例。",
