    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了设计矩阵对线性回归中稀疏参数估计能力（或无能力）的影响。特别地，我们对设计矩阵的最小奇异值远离零时的最优估计速率进行了表征。除了这个信息理论结果，我们还提供并分析了一种同时具有统计最优性和计算效率的过程，该过程基于对普通最小二乘估计器进行软门限。最令人惊讶的是，尽管Lasso估计器被广泛采用用于稀疏线性回归，但我们证明当最小奇异值很小时，Lasso估计器在最小化速率方面是明显次优的。我们提供了一族设计矩阵和稀疏参数，可以保证无论正则化参数的选择是数据依赖性的还是随机的，Lasso估计器都会在估计速率上表现出多项式因素的次优性。",
