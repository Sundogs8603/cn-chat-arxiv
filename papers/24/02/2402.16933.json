In this work, we propose Cobweb4V, a novel visual classification approach that builds on Cobweb, a human like learning system that is inspired by the way humans incrementally learn new concepts over time. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation, showcasing the proficiency of Cobweb4V in learning visual concepts, requiring less data to achieve effective learning outcomes compared to traditional methods, maintaining stable performance over time, and achieving commendable asymptotic behavior, without catastrophic forgetting effects.

    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络在机器学习中表现出色，特别是在视觉任务中，然而，当按顺序学习新任务时，它们经常面临灾难性遗忘。本研究提出了Cobweb4V，这是一种新颖的视觉分类方法，它基于Cobweb，这是一种人类类似的学习系统，受到人类随时间逐渐学习新概念的启发。我们进行了全面评估，展示了Cobweb4V在学习视觉概念方面的熟练程度，相较于传统方法，需要更少的数据来实现有效的学习成果，随时间保持稳定的性能，并实现了令人称赞的渐近行为，避免了灾难性遗忘效应。这些特征与人类认知中的学习策略一致，将Cobweb4V定位为神经网络方法的一个有前途的替代方案。",
