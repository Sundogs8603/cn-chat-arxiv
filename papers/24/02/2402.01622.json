    "abstract": "Planning has been part of the core pursuit for artificial intelligence since its conception, but earlier AI agents mostly focused on constrained settings because many of the cognitive substrates necessary for human-level planning have been lacking. Recently, language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown interesting capabilities such as tool use and reasoning. Are these language agents capable of planning in more complex settings that are out of the reach of prior AI agents? To advance this investigation, we propose TravelPlanner, a new planning benchmark that focuses on travel planning, a common real-world planning scenario. It provides a rich sandbox environment, various tools for accessing nearly four million data records, and 1,225 meticulously curated planning intents and reference plans.

    "translated_abstract": "自规划起初就是人工智能的核心追求之一，但早期的人工智能代理大多集中在受限环境下，因为缺乏进行人类水平规划所需的许多认知基础。最近，由大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的语言代理展现出了工具使用和推理等有趣的能力。这些语言代理能否在超出先前人工智能代理范围的更复杂环境中进行规划？为了推进这项研究，我们提出了TravelPlanner，这是一个新的规划基准，专注于旅行规划这个常见的真实世界规划场景。它提供了一个丰富的沙盒环境，各种用于访问近400万个数据记录的工具，并包含1225个精心策划的规划意图和参考计划。综合评估显示，当前的语言代理尚不具备处理如此复杂的规划任务的能力-即使是GPT-4的成功率也只有0.6%。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种用于自然语言代理的新的规划基准TravelPlanner，它关注于旅行规划这一常见的真实世界场景。经过全面评估，发现目前的语言代理仍无法处理如此复杂的规划任务，即使最先进的GPT-4也只能达到0.6%的成功率。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a new planning benchmark called TravelPlanner, focusing on the common real-world scenario of travel planning, to investigate if current language agents can handle complex planning tasks. The evaluation results show that even the advanced GPT-4 achieves only a 0.6% success rate in these tasks."
