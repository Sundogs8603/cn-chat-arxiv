    "translated_abstract": "不可学习的样本（UEs）是指经过修改使得深度神经网络（DNNs）无法学习的训练样本。这些样本通常是通过添加最小化误差的噪声生成的，这些噪声可以欺骗DNN模型认为从数据中没有任何（无误差）可学习的内容。UE的概念被提出作为对个人数据的未经授权的数据利用的对策。虽然UE在图像上已被广泛研究，但如何针对时间序列数据创建有效的UE仍不清楚。在这项工作中，我们引入了第一个UE生成方法，以保护时间序列数据免受深度学习模型的未授权训练。为此，我们提出了一种新形式的最小化误差噪声，可以\\emph{选择性地}应用于时间序列的特定段落，使它们对DNN模型不可学习，同时对人类观察者来说不可察觉。通过对各种时间序列数据集进行广泛实验，我们证明了所提出的UE生成方法是有效的。",
