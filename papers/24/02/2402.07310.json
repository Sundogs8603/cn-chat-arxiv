    "abstract": "This paper presents BioNeRF, a biologically plausible architecture that models scenes in a 3D representation and synthesizes new views through radiance fields. Since NeRF relies on the network weights to store the scene's 3-dimensional representation, BioNeRF implements a cognitive-inspired mechanism that fuses inputs from multiple sources into a memory-like structure, improving the storing capacity and extracting more intrinsic and correlated information. BioNeRF also mimics a behavior observed in pyramidal cells concerning contextual information, in which the memory is provided as the context and combined with the inputs of two subsequent neural models, one responsible for producing the volumetric densities and the other the colors used to render the scene. Experimental results show that BioNeRF outperforms state-of-the-art results concerning a quality measure that encodes human perception in two datasets: real-world images and synthetic data.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了BioNeRF，一种生物合理的架构，它通过辐射场对场景进行3D表示并合成新视图。由于NeRF依赖于网络权重来存储场景的三维表示，BioNeRF实现了一种受认知启发的机制，将来自多个来源的输入融合成内存类似的结构，提高存储能力并提取更多内在和相关信息。BioNeRF还模仿了金字塔细胞中关于上下文信息的一种行为，其中内存作为上下文提供，并与两个后续神经模型的输入相结合，一个负责生成容积密度，另一个负责渲染场景的颜色。实验结果表明，BioNeRF在两个数据集（真实世界图像和合成数据）上超过了以人的感知为基础的质量度量的最新结果。",
