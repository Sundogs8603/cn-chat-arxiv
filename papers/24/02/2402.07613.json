    "translated_abstract": "我们研究是否存在一种满足可接受变换群指定的对称性质的函数或度量，即同时满足以下两个条件：（1）最小化给定的凸性泛函或风险，（2）满足可容忍对称约束。这种对称性质的例子包括不变性、可变性或准不变性。我们的结果依赖于Stein和Le Cam的老思想，以及在可接受群的遍历定理中出现的近似群平均值。在凸分析中，一类称为轨道凸体的凸集显得至关重要，我们在非参数设置中确定了这类轨道凸体的性质。我们还展示了一个称为coycle的简单装置如何将不同形式的对称性转化为一个问题。作为应用，我们得出了关于不变核均值嵌入和在对称约束下运输方案最优性的Monge-Kantorovich定理的结果。我们还解释了与不变性检验的Hunt-Stein定理的联系。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the global optimality under amenable symmetry constraints, proposing a function or measure that satisfies symmetry properties and solving the problem through the introduction of orbitopes and cocycles. Applications include invariant kernel mean embeddings and optimality of transport plans based on symmetry constraints, with connections to the Hunt-Stein theorem on invariant tests."
