Our newly recorded, naturally confounded dataset named P2S from a real mechanical production line emphasizes this. To tackle the challenging problem of mitigating confounders in time series data, we introduce Right on Time (RioT). Our method enables interactions with model explanations across both the time and frequency domain. Feedback on explanations in both domains is then used to constrain the model, steering it away from the annotated confounding factors. The dual-domain interaction strategy is crucial for effectively addressing confounders in time series datasets. We empirically demonstrate that RioT can effectively guide models away from the wrong reasons in P2S as well as popular time series classification and forecasting datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度时间序列模型的可靠性经常会受到其依赖混杂因素的倾向的损害，这可能导致误导性结果。我们的新记录的、自然混杂的数据集P2S来自真实的机械生产线，强调了这一点。为了解决时间序列数据中的混杂因素的挑战性问题，我们引入了准时到位（RioT）。我们的方法使模型解释在时间和频率域之间进行交互。然后利用两个域内的解释反馈来约束模型，使其远离标注的混杂因素。在处理时间序列数据集中混杂因素方面，双域交互策略至关重要。我们凭经验证明，RioT能够有效地引导模型远离P2S以及流行的时间序列分类和预测数据集中的错误原因。",
