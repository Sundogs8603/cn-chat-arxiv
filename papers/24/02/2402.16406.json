    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.16406v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Clinical trials require numerous documents to be written -- protocols, consent forms, clinical study reports and others. Large language models (LLMs) offer the potential to rapidly generate first versions of these documents, however there are concerns about the quality of their output Here we report an evaluation of LLMs in generating parts of one such document, clinical trial protocols. We find that an offthe-shelf LLM delivers reasonable results, especially when assessing content relevance and the correct use of terminology. However, deficiencies remain: specifically clinical thinking and logic, and appropriate use of references. To improve performance, we used retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to prompt an LLM with accurate up-to-date information. As a result of using RAG, the writing quality of the LLM improves substantially, which has implications for the practical useability of LLMs in clinical trial-related writing.",

    "translated_abstract": "临床试验需要撰写大量文件，包括协议、同意书、临床研究报告等。大型语言模型（LLMs）有潜力快速生成这些文件的第一个版本，但人们对其输出质量存在担忧。本文评估了LLMs在生成其中一个文件（临床试验方案）的部分内容。研究发现，现成的LLM在内容相关性和术语使用正确性方面表现合理。然而，存在不足之处：特别是临床思维和逻辑，以及参考文献的适当使用。为提高性能，我们使用了检索增强生成（RAG）来提示LLM使用准确的最新信息。通过使用RAG，LLM的撰写质量显著提高，这对LLMs在临床试验相关写作中的实际可用性具有重要意义。",
