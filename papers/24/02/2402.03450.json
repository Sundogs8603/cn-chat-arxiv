    "translated_abstract": "在社交推荐系统中，推荐模型提供不同人口群体（如性别或种族）公平的可见性是至关重要的。现有大多数研究只研究了网络的固定快照，而忽视了网络随时间推移的变化。为了填补这一研究空白，我们研究了推荐公平性随时间的演变及其与动态网络属性的关系。我们通过评估六种推荐算法的公平性，并分析公平性与网络属性随时间的关联，来研究三个真实世界动态网络。我们还通过研究替代演化结果和不同网络属性的对照情景，来研究对网络属性的干预如何影响公平性。我们在实证数据集上的结果表明，不论推荐方法如何，推荐公平性随时间的改善。我们还发现两个网络属性，少数群体比例和同质性，与公平性有关。",
