    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种简单高效的自动驾驶车辆的运动预测基线，名为SIMPL。与传统的以智能体为中心的方法相比，虽然具有高准确性但计算重复，以及以场景为中心的方法虽然准确性和泛化性有所妥协，SIMPL可以实时、准确地预测所有相关交通参与者的运动。为了在准确性和推理速度上实现改进，我们提出了一种紧凑高效的全局特征融合模块，以对称方式执行定向消息传递，使网络能够在单次前向传递中预测所有道路使用者的未来运动，并减轻视角转换带来的准确性损失。此外，我们还研究了使用Bernstein基多项式对连续轨迹参数化，允许在任何所需时间点评估轨迹和其高阶导数，这对下游规划任务非常有价值。作为一个强大的基准方法，SIMPL打破了模式并提供了准确结果。",
