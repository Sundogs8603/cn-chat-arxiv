However, effective learning opportunities are rarely accessible. In this work, we conduct a human-centered study that uses language models to simulate bespoke communication training and provide just-in-time feedback to support the practice and learning of interpersonal effectiveness skills. We apply the interpersonal effectiveness framework from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), DEAR MAN, which focuses on both conversational and emotional skills. We present IMBUE, an interactive training system that provides feedback 25% more similar to experts' feedback, compared to that generated by GPT-4. IMBUE is the first to focus on communication skills and emotion management simultaneously, incorporate experts' domain knowledge in providing feedback, and be grounded in psychology theory.

    "translated_abstract": "由于个体缺乏技能和强烈情绪的干扰，导致在某些沟通情境下的导航变得具有挑战性。然而，有效的学习机会很少。本研究进行了一项以人为中心的研究，利用语言模型模拟定制沟通培训，并提供即时反馈，以支持人际有效性技能的实践和学习。我们应用了方言行为治疗（DBT）的人际有效性框架DEAR MAN，重点关注对话和情绪技能。我们提出了IMBUE，这是一个交互式培训系统，其提供的反馈与专业人士反馈更相似，比GPT-4生成的反馈提高了25%。IMBUE首次同时专注于沟通技能和情绪管理，将专家的领域知识纳入提供反馈，并基于心理学理论。通过随机 ...",
