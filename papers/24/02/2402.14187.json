Analyzing a large dataset of sampled English tweets, we examine how newly released emojis gain traction and evolve in meaning. We find that community size of early adopters and emoji semantics are crucial in determining their popularity.

    "translated_abstract": "在社交媒体快速发展的背景下，Unicode发布新表情符号版本提供了一个探索数字语言演变的结构化机会。通过分析大量抽样的英文推文数据集，我们研究了新发布的表情符号如何获得关注并如何在含义上演变。我们发现早期采纳者的社区规模和表情符号语义对于确定它们的受欢迎程度至关重要。在传播过程中，某些表情符号经历了显著的含义变化和情感关联的变化。此外，我们提出了一个利用语言模型提取具有语义上相似上下文的单词和既有表情符号的新框架，这有助于解释新表情符号。该框架通过用熟悉的表情符号替代未知的新表情符号，提高了情感分类性能。这项研究为我们理解新语言的采用提供了新的视角。",
