    "translated_abstract": "深度学习越来越多地通过“浏览器内推理”这种方法整合到Web应用程序中，其中DL处理直接在Web浏览器中进行。然而，这种方法的实际性能及其对用户体验质量（QoE）的影响尚不为人所知。这种知识的空白需要新形式的QoE测量，超越传统的指标，如页面加载时间。为了解决这个问题，我们进行了浏览器内推理的首次全面性能评估。我们引入了新的指标：响应性，流畅度和推理准确性。我们的全面研究包括9个广泛使用的DL模型，并在50个常用的PC Web浏览器上进行了测试。研究结果显示，浏览器内推理存在严重的延迟问题：在CPU上平均比原生推理方法慢16.9倍，在GPU上慢4.9倍。这种延迟有几个因素导致，包括未充分使用的硬件指令集，固有的延迟等。",
