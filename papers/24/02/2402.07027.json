    "translated_abstract": "考虑到Kronecker积在机器学习和优化中的广泛应用，它成为了一个至关重要的线性代数运算符。然而，由于其计算要求高，通过传统计算算法进行Kronecker积的谱逼近的成本也相应增加。现有的经典方法对于谱逼近表现出与矩阵维度$n$线性依赖的特点，其中$A_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$，$A_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$。我们的工作引入了一种创新的方法，使用量子方法高效地解决Kronecker积$A_1 \\otimes A_2$的谱逼近问题。通过将矩阵视为量子态，我们提出的方法将谱逼近的时间复杂度大幅降低到$O_{d,\\epsilon}(\\sqrt{n})$。",
