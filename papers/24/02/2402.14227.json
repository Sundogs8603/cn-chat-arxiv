    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了一种强大的四元数递归神经网络（QRNN），用于实时处理具有异常值的3D和4D数据。这是通过将实时递归学习（RTRL）算法和最大相关性准则（MCC）结合为损失函数来实现的。尽管均方误差和最大相关性准则都是可行的代价函数，但结果表明非二次最大相关性损失函数对异常值不太敏感，适用于具有多维嘈杂或不确定数据的应用。这两种算法基于新颖的广义HR（GHR）微积分导出，它允许对四元数变量的实函数进行微分，并提供乘法和链式法则，从而实现优雅且简洁的导出。在胸部内部标记物的运动预测背景下进行的仿真结果涵盖了肺癌放疗中的常规和不规则呼吸序列。",
