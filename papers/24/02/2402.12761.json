    "translated_abstract": "图异常检测 (GAD) 旨在识别明显偏离其他图的异常图，由于在许多现实场景中存在图结构数据的广泛存在和复杂性，GAD引起了越来越多的关注。然而，现有的GAD方法通常需要在集中训练，这可能导致在某些敏感场合存在隐私泄露风险，从而阻碍了寻求共同开发强大GAD模型的组织之间的合作。尽管联邦学习提供了一个有前途的解决方案，但普遍存在的非独立同分布问题和高通信成本在分布在不同参与者之间的图数据合作中提出了重大挑战。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种有效的联邦图异常检测框架 (FGAD)。我们首先引入一个异常生成器来扰动正常图以成为异常图，并训练一个强大的异常检测",
