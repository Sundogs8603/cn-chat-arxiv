However, broad language coverage can still mask performance gaps within languages, for example, across genders. We systematically evaluate multilingual ASR systems on gendered performance gaps. Using two popular models on three datasets in 19 languages across seven language families, we find clear gender disparities. However, the advantaged group varies between languages. While there are no significant differences across groups in phonetic variables (pitch, speaking rate, etc.), probing the model's internal states reveals a negative correlation between probe performance and the gendered performance gap. I.e., the easier to distinguish speaker gender in a language, the more the models favor female speakers. Our results show that group dispar",

    "translated_abstract": "当前的语音识别方法使用多任务、多语言模型来进行诸如自动语音识别（ASR）的语音任务，使其适用于许多语言而不需要实质性的更改。然而，广泛的语言覆盖仍然可能掩盖语言内部存在的性别差距。本文系统评估多语言ASR系统在性别表现差距上的情况。在19种语言的三个数据集上使用两种流行模型，跨越七个语言家族，我们发现明显的性别差异。不过，不同语言中受益的群体各不相同。尽管在语音学变量（音高、说话速度等）上各群体间没有显著差异，但探索模型内部状态却揭示了探查性能和性别表现差距之间的负相关关系。即，在某种语言中更容易区分说话者性别，模型就更偏向于女性说话者。我们的结果显示组别差异",
