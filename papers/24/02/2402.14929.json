In this work, we propose a new approach to guarantee group fairness that does not rely on any predefined definition of sensitive groups or additional labels. Our objective allows the federation to learn a Pareto efficient global model ensuring worst-case group fairness and it enables, via a single hyper-parameter, trade-offs between fairness and utility, subject only to a group size constraint.

    "translated_abstract": "当前联邦学习中关于群体公平性的方法都假设在训练期间存在预定义和标记的敏感群体。然而，由于从新兴法规到受保护群体的动态和位置依赖性等多种因素，这一假设在许多实际情况下可能不合适。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的方法来保证群体公平性，不依赖于任何预定义的敏感群体的定义或额外的标签。我们的目标允许联邦学习学习一个帕累托有效的全局模型，确保最坏情况下的群体公平性，并且通过一个超参数，实现公平性和效用之间的权衡，仅受到群体大小约束。这意味着任何足够大的人群子集都保证能从模型中获得至少的最低效用性能。所提出的目标涵盖了现有方法作为特殊案例，",
