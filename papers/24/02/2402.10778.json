    "translated_abstract": "最近关于任务规划的一些新进展利用了大型语言模型（LLMs），通过将这些模型与经典规划算法结合起来来提高泛化能力，以解决它们在推理能力上固有的局限性。然而，这些方法面临着动态捕捉任务规划问题的初始状态的挑战。为了缓解这一问题，我们提出了AutoGPT+P，这是一个系统，将基于Affordance的场景表示与一个规划系统相结合。Affordance包括了一个代理在环境中和其中存在的物体上的动作可能性。因此，从基于Affordance的场景表示中推导出规划域，允许使用任意对象进行符号规划。AutoGPT+P利用这种表示来为用户用自然语言指定的任务制定和执行计划。除了在封闭世界假设下解决规划任务外，AutoGPT+P还可以处理具有不确定性的规划任务。",
