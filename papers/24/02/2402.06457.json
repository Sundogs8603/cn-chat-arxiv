To address this shortcoming, we propose V-STaR that utilizes both the correct and incorrect solutions generated during the self-improvement process to train a verifier using DPO that judges correctness of model-generated solutions. This verifier is used at inference time to select one solution among many candidate solutions. Running V-STaR for multiple iterations results in progressively better reasoners and verifiers, delivering a 4% to 17% test accuracy improvement over existing self-improvement and verification approaches on common code generation and math reasoning benchmarks with LLaMA2 models.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）的常见自我改进方法，例如STaR（Zelikman等人，2022），通过自动生成的解决方案迭代微调LLM以提高其问题解决能力。然而，这些方法在此过程中丢弃了大量的不正确的解决方案，可能忽略了这些解决方案中的宝贵信息。为了解决这个缺点，我们提出了V-STaR，它利用自我改进过程中生成的正确和不正确的解决方案来使用DPO训练一个判断模型生成解决方案的正确性的验证器。在推理时，这个验证器用来在众多候选解决方案中选择一个解决方案。多次运行V-STaR会逐步产生更好的推理器和验证器，在常见代码生成和数学推理基准测试中，使用LLaMA2模型可以取得4%到17%的测试准确率提升。",
