In this article, after giving some background and motivating my proposal (sections 1 to 3), I explore a way to answer this question that I call the \"mental-behavioral methodology\" (sections 4 and 5). This methodology follows the following three steps: First, spell out what mental capacities are sufficient for human communication (as opposed to communication more generally). Second, spell out the experimental paradigms required to test whether a behavior exhibits these capacities. Third, apply or adapt these paradigms to test whether an AI displays the relevant behaviors. If the first two steps are successfully completed, and if the AI passes the tests with human-like results, this constitutes evidence that this AI and humans can genuinely communicate. This mental-behavioral methodology has the advantage that we don't need to understand the workings of black-box algorithms, such as standard deep ",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇文章探讨了一个问题，即AI和人类是否能够真正交流。作者提出了一个称为“心理行为方法”的方式来回答这个问题。该方法包括三个步骤：首先明确人类交流所需的心理能力；其次确定测试这些能力的实验范式；最后将这些范式应用于测试AI是否展现出相关的行为。如果前两个步骤成功完成，并且AI在测试中展现出类似人类的结果，那么这可以被看作是AI和人类能够真正交流的证据。心理行为方法的优势在于我们不需要理解黑盒算法（比如标准深度学习算法）的工作原理。",
