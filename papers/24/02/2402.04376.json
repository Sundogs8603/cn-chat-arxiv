    "translated_abstract": "收集大量高质量的数据通常被限制在成本昂贵或不切实际的范围内, 这是机器学习中的一个关键瓶颈。相反地, 可以将来自目标分布的小规模数据集与来自公共数据集、不同情况下收集的数据或由生成模型合成的数据相结合, 作为替代数据。我们提出了一种简单的方案来将替代数据整合到训练中, 并使用理论模型和实证研究探索其行为。我们的主要发现是：(i) 整合替代数据可以显著降低原始分布的测试误差；(ii) 为了获得这种效益, 使用最优加权经验风险最小化非常关键；(iii) 在混合使用真实数据和替代数据训练的模型的测试误差可以很好地用一个扩展规律来描述。这可以用来预测最优加权和收益。",
