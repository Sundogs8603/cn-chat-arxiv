    "translated_abstract": "在现代软件发挥关键作用的时代，软件安全和漏洞分析对于软件开发变得至关重要。作为一种高效的软件测试方法，模糊测试被广泛应用于各个领域。此外，大语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展使它们可以在软件测试领域中应用，并展现出卓越的性能。考虑到现有的模糊测试技术并不完全自动化，软件漏洞不断演化，越来越多的趋势是采用基于大语言模型生成的模糊测试。本综述提供了关于融合LLMs和模糊测试的软件测试方法的系统概述。通过总结2024年之前的最新方法，对LLMs、模糊测试和基于LLMs的模糊测试进行统计分析和讨论。我们的综述还研究了LLMs和模糊测试在软件测试领域的应用，并讨论了相关的挑战和未来的研究方向。",
