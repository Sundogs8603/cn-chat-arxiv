    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们提出了一种方法，通过MIONet学习定义在不同域上的PDE的解算子，并在理论上证明了这种方法。我们首先将MIONet的逼近理论扩展到进一步处理度量空间，建立MIONet可以在度量空间中逼近具有多个输入的映射。随后，我们构建了一个包含一些适当区域的集合，并为这个集合提供了一个度量，从而使其成为一个度量空间，满足MIONet的逼近条件。基于理论基础，我们能够学习PDE的解映射，其中包括各种参数的变化，包括微分算子的参数，右手边项，边界条件以及域。举例来说，我们对2D泊松方程进行了实验，其中域和右手边项是变化的。结果提供了洞见。",
