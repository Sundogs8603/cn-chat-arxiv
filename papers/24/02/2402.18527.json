    "translated_abstract": "本文通过利用传统特征提取方法（如局部二值模式（LBP）和灰度共生矩阵（GLCM）特征，以及基于傅里叶和小波的特征）以及先进的机器学习技术，介绍了一种用于轮胎X射线图像自动检测缺陷的稳健方法。研究强调了对轮胎X射线图像复杂图案和纹理的挑战的认识，并强调了通过特征工程来提高缺陷检测系统性能的重要性。通过将这些特征组合与随机森林（RF）分类器进行精心整合，并将它们与先进模型如YOLOv8进行比较，研究不仅对传统特征在缺陷检测中的性能进行了基准测试，还探讨了经典方法和现代方法之间的协同作用。实验结果表明，这些传统特征在微调后可以与先进模型媲美，从而实现了更优异的缺陷检测性能。",
