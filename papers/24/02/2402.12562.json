    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.12562v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We consider a dynamic pricing problem where customer response to the current price is impacted by the customer price expectation, aka reference price. We study a simple and novel reference price mechanism where reference price is the average of the past prices offered by the seller. As opposed to the more commonly studied exponential smoothing mechanism, in our reference price mechanism the prices offered by seller have a longer term effect on the future customer expectations.   We show that under this mechanism, a markdown policy is near-optimal irrespective of the parameters of the model. This matches the common intuition that a seller may be better off by starting with a higher price and then decreasing it, as the customers feel like they are getting bargains on items that are ordinarily more expensive. For linear demand models, we also provide a detailed characterization of the near-optimal markdown policy along with an efficient way",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了一个动态定价问题，其中顾客对当前价格的反应受到顾客价格期望，即参考价格的影响。我们研究了一种简单而新颖的参考价格机制，其中参考价格是卖家过去提供的价格的平均值。与更常见的指数平滑机制相反，在我们的参考价格机制中，卖家提供的价格对未来顾客期望有更长期的影响。我们展示，在这种机制下，降价政策几乎是最优的，不受模型参数的影响。这符合一个常见的直觉，即卖家可以通过以较高的价格出发，然后逐渐降低价格，因为顾客会觉得他们正在购买通常更昂贵的物品上的便宜货。对于线性需求模型，我们还提供了近似最优降价策略的详细特征性描述以及一个有效的方法。",
