    "translated_abstract": "Quantum Machine Learning (QML)已经成为一个主要的框架，用于解决顺序控制任务和时间序列建模。 特别是在强化学习（RL）和时间序列预测等领域，已经展示了经验量子优势。 量子循环神经网络（QRNNs）是一个重大进展，专门为存储密集型任务设计，包括部分可观测环境和非线性时间序列预测。 然而，基于QRNN的模型面临挑战，尤其是由于需要使用通过时间反向传播（BPTT）计算量子梯度而产生的训练时间延长的问题。 当在量子设备上执行完整模型时，由于参数移位规则带来的电路评估需求巨大，这个困境进一步加剧。 本文将量子快速权重程序员（QFWP）引入作为解决方案。",
