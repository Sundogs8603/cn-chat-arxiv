In particular, we mathematically model and analyze the effects on the gain of each strategy choice and the formation process of evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) under the assumption that the pollution risk of fake news is randomly assigned in the context of repeated dilemmas. We will develop the computational process in detail, starting with the construction of the gain matrix, modeling the evolutionary dynamics using the replicator equation, and identifying the ESS. In addition, numerical simulations will be performed to observe system behavior under different initial conditions and parameter settings to better understand the impact of the spread of fake news on strategy evolution. This research will provide theoretical insights into the complex issue",
