    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种名为PASOA的新程序，用于贝叶斯实验设计，通过同时提供连续的后验分布的准确估计来执行顺序设计优化。顺序设计过程通过对比估计原则进行，使用随机优化和顺序蒙特卡罗（SMC）采样器来最大化期望信息增益（EIG）。由于连续后验分布之间的距离越大，获得的信息增益越大，因此这个EIG目标可能会恶化经典SMC的性能。为了解决这个问题，提出了温度调节，既可以获得大的信息增益，又可以获得准确的SMC采样，我们证明这对性能来说是至关重要的。这种随机优化和温度调节的新颖组合允许同时处理设计优化和参数推断。我们证明了所得到的最优设计估计量具有一致性。数值实验表明，我们的方法在相同计算预算下比其他方法更好地优化了设计。",
