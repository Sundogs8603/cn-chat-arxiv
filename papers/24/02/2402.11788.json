    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11788v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Survival risk stratification is an important step in clinical decision making for breast cancer management. We propose a novel deep learning approach for this purpose by integrating histopathological imaging, genetic and clinical data. It employs vision transformers, specifically the MaxViT model, for image feature extraction, and self-attention to capture intricate image relationships at the patient level. A dual cross-attention mechanism fuses these features with genetic data, while clinical data is incorporated at the final layer to enhance predictive accuracy. Experiments on the public TCGA-BRCA dataset show that our model, trained using the negative log likelihood loss function, can achieve superior performance with a mean C-index of 0.64, surpassing existing methods. This advancement facilitates tailored treatment strategies, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.",

    "translated_abstract": "生存风险分层是乳腺癌管理中临床决策的重要步骤。我们提出了一种新颖的深度学习方法，通过整合组织病理学影像、遗传学和临床数据来实现这一目的。它采用视觉变换器，特别是MaxViT模型，用于图像特征提取，利用自注意力机制在患者水平捕捉复杂的图像关系。双交叉注意力机制将这些特征与遗传数据融合，而临床数据在最终层级进行合并以提高预测准确性。在公开的TCGA-BRCA数据集上进行的实验表明，我们的模型使用负对数似然损失函数训练，可以达到0.64的平均C-index，超越了现有方法。这一进展有助于制定个性化治疗策略，潜在地改善患者预后。",
