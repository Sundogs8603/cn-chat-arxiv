    "translated_abstract": "本研究调查了在越野自动驾驶领域中，语义分割模型对抗输入扰动的脆弱性。尽管在通用条件下表现良好，但最先进的分类器往往容易受到甚至是较小的扰动的影响，最终导致高置信度的不准确预测。以往的研究将重点放在通过修改架构并使用嘈杂的输入图像进行训练来使模型更加稳健，但却没有探索数据集在对抗攻击中的影响。本研究旨在通过研究越野数据集中的非稳健特征的影响，并比较对不同分割网络架构的对抗攻击的影响来填补这一空白。为了实现这一目标，我们创建了一个稳健的数据集，其中只包含稳健特征，并在该稳健数据集上训练网络。我们对研究结果进行了定性和定量分析，这些结果具有重要性。",
