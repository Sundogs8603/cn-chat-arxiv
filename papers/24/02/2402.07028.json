    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑将对应于不同语言的两个连续词表示集对齐到一个共同空间，以推断双语词典的问题。最近的研究表明，通过将在单语数据上训练的词嵌入对齐，可以推断出这样的词典而不使用任何平行数据。这种工作称为无监督双语诱导。通过思考是否可能在逐步学习多种语言的过程中积累经验，我们自问在学习新语言时是否能够在没有平行数据的情况下整合给定语言集的知识。换句话说，虽然保持无监督学习的核心问题在最新步骤中，但我们允许访问其他习语语料库，因此称为半监督。这导致我们提出了一种新的表达形式，将词典诱导视为一个排序问题，我们使用了该机器学习领域的最新工具。",

The method integrates knowledge from existing language sets during the learning of a new language, and uses a ranking approach for lexicon induction."
