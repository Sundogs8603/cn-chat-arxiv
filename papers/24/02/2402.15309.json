This generation process usually requires the identification of the disentangled latent representations, such as content and style, that underlie the observed data. However, it becomes more challenging when faced with a scarcity of paired data and labeling information. Existing disentangled methods crucially rely on oversimplified assumptions, such as assuming independent content and style variables, to identify the latent variables, even though such assumptions may not hold for complex data distributions. For instance, food reviews tend to involve words like tasty, whereas movie reviews commonly contain words such as thrilling for the same positive sentiment. This problem is exacerbated when data are sampled from multiple domains since the dependence between content and style may vary significantly",

    "translated_abstract": "反事实生成是各种机器学习任务的核心，包括图像转换和可控文本生成。这一生成过程通常需要识别潜在的分解表征，如内容和风格，这些表征潜在地支撑着观察到的数据。然而，当面临配对数据和标注信息的稀缺时，情况变得更具挑战性。现有的分解方法关键依赖于过度简化的假设，比如假设内容和风格变量独立，以识别潜在变量，尽管这样的假设可能并不适用于复杂的数据分布。例如，食物评论往往涉及“美味”等词语，而电影评论通常含有“惊心动魄”等词语表示同样的积极情感。当数据从多个领域采样时，由于内容和风格之间的相互关系可能会显著变化，这个问题会变得更加严重。",
