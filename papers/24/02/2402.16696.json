Nowadays, advanced closed-source LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) have demonstrated surprising tool-usage capabilities through prompting and in-context learning techniques. To empower the capabilities of open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA) in manipulating tools, current efforts focus on either template-driven or token-triggered tool-usage. However, the former hampers LLMs' flexibility to address diverse user's queries due to constrained tool interactions, while the latter limits the generalizability when engaging with new tools, since tool-usage learning is based on task- and tool-specific datasets.

    "translated_abstract": "工具增强的大型语言模型（LLM）在获取最新知识和缓解产生幻觉问题方面引起了广泛关注。当前，先进的闭源LLM（如ChatGPT）通过提示和上下文学习技术展示出令人惊讶的工具使用能力。为了增强开源LLM（如LLaMA）在操作工具方面的能力，当前的努力集中于基于模板驱动或基于标记触发的工具使用。然而，前者由于受到限制的工具交互，限制了LLM灵活地解决各种用户查询，而后者在使用新工具时限制了泛化能力，因为工具使用学习基于任务和工具特定的数据集。为了缓解这些问题，本文提出了一种决策感知和可泛化的工具使用框架（DEER）。具体而言，我们首先构建具有多个决策分支的工具使用样本。",
