Integrating UAVs in such environments is inherently challenging, where the primary objectives involve maximizing network connectivity and coverage while extending the network's lifetime through energy-efficient strategies to serve the maximum number of affected individuals. In this paper, We propose a novel model centred around dynamic UAV-based fog deployment that optimizes the system's adaptability and operational efficacy within the afflicted areas.
