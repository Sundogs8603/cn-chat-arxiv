    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.17987v1 公告类型：跨领域 摘要：无人机的雷达自动目标识别（RATR）涉及发射电磁波并对接收到的雷达回波执行目标类型识别，对国防和航空航天应用至关重要。先前的研究突出了多态雷达配置在RATR中优于单态雷达的优势。然而，多态雷达配置中的融合方法通常以概率方式次优地组合来自各个雷达的分类向量。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个完全贝叶斯RATR框架，采用最优贝叶斯融合（OBF）来聚合来自多个雷达的分类概率向量。OBF基于期望0-1损失，根据多个时间步骤的历史观测更新目标无人机类型的递归贝叶斯分类（RBC）后验分布。我们使用模拟的随机行走轨迹评估了这种方法，共涉及七种机动目标。",
