    "translated_abstract": "量子计算是一个快速发展的领域，承诺着许多实际应用，如量子密码学或量子金融。然而，能够使用量子计算的人数仍然非常有限。这一限制来自于理解概念和如何开始编程的困难。因此，需要一种工具来帮助非专家克服这种复杂性。使用现有的对话系统是一个可能的选择。不幸的是，ChatGPT和其他大型语言模型产生了不准确的结果。本文介绍了C4Q，一个能够准确回答基本问题并在编写量子程序时引导用户的聊天机器人。与其他方法相反，C4Q只使用一个经过预训练的大型语言模型来发现和分类用户请求。然后，它使用自己的引擎生成准确的答案。由于这种架构设计，C4Q的答案总是正确的，因此C4Q可以成为一个支持工具，使量子计算成为可能。",
