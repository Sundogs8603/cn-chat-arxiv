To that end, we pioneer the approach of training an intrinsically bilingual model with a 1:1 English-to-French pretraining data ratio, a custom tokenizer, and bilingual finetuning datasets. We release the training dataset, notably containing a French split with manually curated, high-quality, and varied data sources. To assess performance outside of English, we craft a novel benchmark, FrenchBench, consisting of an array of classification and generation tasks, covering various orthogonal aspects of model performance in the French Language. Additionally, rooted in transparency and to foster further Large Language Model research, we release codebases, and dozens of checkpoints across various model sizes, training data distributions, ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了CroissantLLM，这是一个在3T个英语和法语标记上预训练的13亿语言模型，为研究和工业社区带来了一种高性能的、完全开源的双语模型，可以在消费级本地硬件上快速运行。为此，我们首次尝试使用1:1的英语-法语预训练数据比例、自定义的分词器和双语调优数据集来训练一种内在双语的模型。我们发布了训练数据集，其中包含了一个法语分割，其中包含了手工策划、高质量和多样化的数据源。为了评估在英语以外的性能，我们创建了一个新的基准测试 FrenchBench，包括一系列分类和生成任务，涵盖了模型在法语语言中性能的各个方面。此外，为了保持透明度并促进进一步的大规模语言模型研究，我们发布了代码库和各种模型规模、训练数据分布上的几十个检查点。",
