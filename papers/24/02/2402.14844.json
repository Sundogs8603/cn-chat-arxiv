We utilize dynamic modeling of price elasticity, informed by ordinary least squares (OLS) metrics such as p-values, homoscedasticity, error normality. These metrics, when their underlying assumptions hold, are integral in guiding a quadratic programming agent. The program is tasked with optimizing margin for a given finite set target.",
