    "translated_abstract": "鲁棒性是机器人在非结构化环境中成功部署的关键因素，特别在同时定位和建图（SLAM）领域。与真实世界数据收集相比，基于仿真的基准测试已成为一种高度可扩展的评估鲁棒性的方法。然而，创建具有多样化扰动的具有挑战性且可控的嘈杂环境仍然相对未开发。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的可定制化的噪声数据合成流程，旨在评估多模态SLAM模型对各种扰动的鲁棒性。该流程结合了可定制化硬件配置、软件组件和被扰动环境。特别地，我们引入了全面的扰动分类法以及扰动组合工具箱，可以将干净的仿真转化为具有挑战性的嘈杂环境。利用该流程，我们建立了鲁棒-SLAM基准测试，其中包括多模态的扰动合成和鲁棒性评估指标。",
