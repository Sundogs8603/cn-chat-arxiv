    "translated_abstract": "眼部疾病从糖尿病性视网膜病变到青光眼等，由于其高发病率和可能导致视力损害，构成了一个重要的公共卫生挑战。及早和准确的诊断对于有效治疗和管理至关重要。近年来，深度学习模型已经成为分析医学图像（包括眼部图像）的强大工具。然而，模型的解释性和不确定性估计方面仍然存在挑战，这对临床决策至关重要。本研究引入了GFlowOut的新颖应用，利用生成流网络（GFlowNets）的概率框架来学习关于辍学掩码的后验分布，用于使用眼底图像对眼部疾病进行分类和分析。我们开发了一种稳健且具有普适性的方法，利用以ResNet18和ViT模型为主干的GFlowOut来识别各种眼部状况。",
