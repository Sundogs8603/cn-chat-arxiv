    "translated_abstract": "功能性近红外光谱（fNIRS）是一种非侵入式监测大脑活动的技术。为了更好地理解大脑，研究人员经常使用深度学习来应对fNIRS数据的分类挑战。我们的研究表明，尽管当前fNIRS中的网络在其训练分布内进行预测时准确率很高，但在识别和排除分布之外的异常数据方面表现不佳，影响了其可靠性。我们提出将度量学习和监督方法整合到fNIRS研究中，以提高网络在识别和排除分布之外的异常值方面的能力。这种方法简单而有效。在我们的实验证明，它显著提升了各种fNIRS网络的性能，特别是基于transformer的网络，进一步提升了可靠性。我们将在GitHub上公开我们的实验数据。",
