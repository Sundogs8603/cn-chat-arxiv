    "abstract": "This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze text comments from Reddit users, aiming to achieve two primary objectives: firstly, to pinpoint critical excerpts that support a predefined psychological assessment of suicidal risk; and secondly, to summarize the material to substantiate the preassigned suicidal risk level. The work is circumscribed to the use of \"open-source\" LLMs that can be run locally, thereby enhancing data privacy. Furthermore, it prioritizes models with low computational requirements, making it accessible to both individuals and institutions operating on limited computing budgets. The implemented strategy only relies on a carefully crafted prompt and a grammar to guide the LLM's text completion. Despite its simplicity, the evaluation metrics show outstanding results, making it a valuable privacy-focused and cost-effective approach. This work is part of the Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) 2024 shared task.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探索了使用大型语言模型（LLMs）分析Reddit用户的文本评论，主要目标有两个：第一，确定支持预定义的自杀风险心理评估的关键摘录；第二，总结材料以证实预分配的自杀风险水平。该工作局限于使用可以在本地运行的“开源”LLMs，从而增强数据隐私。此外，它优先选用计算要求较低的模型，以使有限的计算预算的个人和机构能够使用。实施的策略仅依赖于精心设计的提示和语法，以指导LLM的文本完成。尽管简单，评估指标显示出杰出的结果，使之成为一种有价值的注重隐私和具有成本效益的方法。此工作是2024 Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych)共享任务的一部分。",
