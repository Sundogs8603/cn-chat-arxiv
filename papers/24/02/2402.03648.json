    "translated_abstract": "本论文介绍了一种新颖的非参数数据插补方法，被称为多线性核回归和流形学习插补方法（MultiL-KRIM）。受到流形学习的启发，MultiL-KRIM把数据特征建模为位于或接近嵌入在再生核希尔伯特空间中的未知平滑流形的点云。与典型的流形学习方法不同，后者通过基于图拉普拉斯矩阵的正则化器寻找低维模式，MultiL-KRIM则建立在对流形的切空间的直观概念上，并将点云邻居之间的协作（回归器）直接纳入损失函数的数据建模项中。多个核函数的使用提供了鲁棒性和丰富的逼近性质，而多个矩阵因子提供了低秩建模，整合了降维，并且在没有训练数据的情况下简化了计算。两个重要的应用领域展示了该方法的功能。",
