Further, integrating LLMs with vision enables the users to explore emergent abilities with multimodal data. Visual language models (VLMs), such as LLaVA, Flamingo, or CLIP, have demonstrated impressive performance on various visio-linguistic tasks. Consequently, there are enormous applications of large models that could be potentially used in the biomedical imaging field. Along that direction, there is a lack of related work to show the ability of large models to diagnose the diseases. In this work, we study the zero-shot and few-shot robustness of VLMs on the medical imaging analysis tasks. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of VLMs in analyzing biomedical images such as brain MRIs, microscopic images of blood cells, and chest X-rays.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理中备受关注。将LLMs与视觉相结合，使用户能够探索利用多模态数据的新兴能力。视觉语言模型（VLMs），如LLaVA、Flamingo或CLIP，在各种视觉语言任务中展现出显著的表现。因此，大型模型在生物医学影像领域有着巨大的潜在应用。沿着这个方向，目前缺乏相关工作来展示大型模型诊断疾病的能力。在这项工作中，我们研究了VLMs在医学影像分析任务中的零样本和少样本鲁棒性。我们的全面实验表明了VLMs在分析生物医学图像（如脑MRI、血细胞显微图像和胸部X光片）方面的有效性。",
