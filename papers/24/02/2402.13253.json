Our model facilitates a wide range of medical interactions in English and Arabic, including multi-turn chats to inquire about additional details such as patient symptoms and medical history, multiple-choice question answering, and open-ended question answering. We propose a semi-automated English-to-Arabic translation pipeline with human refinement to ensure high-quality translations. We also introduce a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for Arabic medical LLMs. Furthermore, we introduce BiMed1.3M, an extensive Arabic-English bilingual instruction set covering 1.3 Million diverse medical interactions, resulting in over 632 million healthcare specialized tokens for instruction tuning. Our BiMed1.3M dataset includes 250k synthesized multi-turn doctor-patient chats and maintains a 1:2 Arabic-",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们介绍了BiMediX，这是第一个旨在实现在英语和阿拉伯语之间无缝互动的双语医学专家混合模型LLM。我们的模型在英语和阿拉伯语之间促进了广泛范围的医学交互，包括多轮对话以询问关于患者症状和病史等额外细节、多项选择题回答以及开放式问题回答。我们提出了一个半自动化的英语到阿拉伯语翻译流水线，结合人工优化以确保高质量的翻译。我们还引入了一个用于阿拉伯语医学LLMs的全面评估基准。此外，我们推出了BiMed1.3M，一个涵盖130万各种医学交互的广泛的阿拉伯语-英语双语指令集，产生了超过6.32亿个医疗专业token以进行指令调整。我们的BiMed1.3M数据集包括25万个合成的医生-患者多轮对话，并保持1:2的阿拉伯语比例。",
