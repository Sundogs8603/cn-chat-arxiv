    "translated_abstract": "数学应用题在K-8教育中至关重要，但编写它们耗时且需要领域专业知识。我们认为语言模型可以通过自动生成规模化问题来支持K-8数学教育。为了教育性，生成的问题必须是1）可解决的，2）准确的，3）适当的。现有数据集未标记这些标准，因此不适合训练问题生成器。我们引入了MATHWELL，这是一个经过专家注释数据进行迭代微调的70B Llama-2模型，用于生成K-8数学应用题。借助MATHWELL，我们生成了迄今为止最大的英文应用题数据集，其中包含20,490个问题。经领域专家评分的3,484个问题发现，MATHWELL拥有比其他选择更高的可执行解决方案和满足所有标准的问题份额高出40％，其中74％的问题具有可解的、准确的和适当的解决方案。",
