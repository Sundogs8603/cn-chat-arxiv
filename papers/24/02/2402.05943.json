    "translated_abstract": "在软件定义网络中使用数据流预测进行异常检测是一项困难的任务。这个问题归类为时序和回归问题。机器学习方法在这个领域中具有挑战性，因为需要手动选择特征。而深度学习方法由于能够自动选择特征具有重要的特点。与此同时，基于 RNN 的方法被广泛使用。LSTM 和 GRU 方法能够很好地学习相关实体；而 IndRNN 方法则能够学习时序中的非相关实体。本文提出的方法尝试使用 IndRNN 和 LSTM 的组合来学习相关和非相关特征。特征选择方法还为模型提供了适当的特征视角；为了实现这一目的，使用了四种特征选择模型：Filter、Wrapper、Embedded 和 Autoencoder。提出的 IndRNNLSTM 算法与 Embedded 的组合能够在 NSL-KDD 数据集上实现 MAE=1.22 和 RMSE=9.92。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a hybrid IndRNNLSTM approach for real-time anomaly detection in software-defined networks. By combining the strengths of IndRNN and LSTM, the approach learns both dependent and non-dependent features and utilizes four feature selection models for a suitable feature perspective. Experimental results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate lower MAE and RMSE values achieved by this method."
