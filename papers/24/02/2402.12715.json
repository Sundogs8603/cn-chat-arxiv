    "title": "Spurious Correlations in Machine Learning: A Survey",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.12715v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Machine learning systems are known to be sensitive to spurious correlations between biased features of the inputs (e.g., background, texture, and secondary objects) and the corresponding labels. These features and their correlations with the labels are known as \"spurious\" because they tend to change with shifts in real-world data distributions, which can negatively impact the model's generalization and robustness. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of this issue, along with a taxonomy of current state-of-the-art methods for addressing spurious correlations in machine learning models. Additionally, we summarize existing datasets, benchmarks, and metrics to aid future research. The paper concludes with a discussion of the recent advancements and future research challenges in this field, aiming to provide valuable insights for researchers in the related domains.",

    "translated_abstract": "众所周知，机器学习系统对输入中偏见特征（例如背景、纹理和次要对象）与相应标签之间的虚假相关性敏感。这些特征及其与标签的相关性被称为“虚假”，因为它们往往随着真实世界数据分布的变化而改变，这可能对模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性产生负面影响。在这项调查中，我们全面审查了这一问题，提供了一个关于解决机器学习模型中虚假相关性的当前最先进方法的分类法。此外，我们总结了现有的数据集、基准和度量标准，以帮助未来的研究。本文最后讨论了这一领域的最新进展和未来研究挑战，旨在为相关领域的研究人员提供宝贵的见解。",
