    "translated_abstract": "我们探讨了当$W<d$时，通过梯度流（GF）以$W$参数模型学习$d$维目标的理论可能性，必然存在GF-不可学习目标的大子集。特别是，可学习目标的集合在$\\mathbb R^d$中不是密集的，任何形同$W$维球面的$\\mathbb R^d$子集包含不可学习目标。最后，我们观察到在几乎保证二参数学习的主要定理中，所述模型是通过层次过程构建的，因此不能用单个初等函数表达。我们展示了这种限制在本质上是必要的，因为这种可学习性对于许多初等函数类的可学习性是被排除的。",
    "tldr": "通过提出两参数模型和梯度流学习高维目标的理论可能性，研究发现在特定条件下存在大量不可学习目标，并且这些目标的集合不密集，具有一定拓扑性质的子集中也存在不可学习目标。最终，发现使用层次过程构建的主要定理模型在数学表达上并非由单一初等函数表示。",
    "en_tdlr": "Theoretical investigation on learning high-dimensional targets with two-parameter models and gradient flow reveals the existence of a large subset of non-learnable targets under specific conditions, where the set of learnable targets is not dense and non-learnable targets exist in subsets with certain topological properties. Furthermore, the main theorem's model, constructed using a hierarchical process, cannot be expressed by a single elementary function, demonstrating the essential limitation that rules out learnability for a wide range of elementary functions."
