In this work, we argue that an evaluation of a causal discovery method against synthetic data should include an analysis of how well this explicit goal is achieved by measuring how closely the separations/connections of the method's output align with those of the ground truth. We show that established evaluation measures do not accurately capture the difference in separations/connections of two causal graphs, and we introduce three new measures of distance called s/c-distance, Markov distance and Faithfulness distance that address this shortcoming. We complement our theoretical analysis with toy examples, empirical experiments and pseudocode.",

    "translated_abstract": "许多最先进的因果推断方法旨在生成一个输出图，该图编码了生成数据过程的因果图的图形分离和连接陈述。在本文中，我们认为，对合成数据的因果推断方法进行评估应该包括分析该方法的输出与真实情况的分离/连接程度，以衡量这一明确目标的实现情况。我们证明现有的评估指标不能准确捕捉到两个因果图的分离/连接差异，并引入了三个新的距离度量指标，即s/c距离、马尔科夫距离和忠实度距离，以解决这个问题。我们通过玩具示例、实证实验和伪代码来补充我们的理论分析。",
