These results allow to accurately predict the reconstruction performance of truncated multilinear SVD (MLSVD) in the non-trivial regime. This is particularly important since it serves as an initialization of the higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) scheme, whose convergence to the best low-multilinear-rank approximation depends entirely on its initialization.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究从计算阈值附近的一般尖峰张量模型，对种植的低秩信号估计进行了全面的认识。依靠大型随机矩阵理论的标准工具，我们表征了数据张量的展开的大维谱行为，并展示了决定主要信号方向可检测性的相关信噪比。这些结果可以准确地预测在非平凡区域的截断多线性奇异值分解(MLSVD)的重建性能。这一点尤其重要，因为它作为更高阶正交迭代(HOOI)方案的初始化，其收敛到最佳低多线性秩逼近完全取决于其初始化。我们给出了HOOI收敛的充分条件，并证明在大维极限下收敛前的迭代次数趋于1。",
