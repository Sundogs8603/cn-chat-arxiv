    "translated_abstract": "合作是STEM的关键，多学科团队研究可以解决复杂问题。然而，STEM领域的不平等阻碍了其充分发展，因为在公平与包容团队中存在着持续的心理障碍。本文记录了STEM团队合作，并探讨了计算建模和生成性人工智能在促进STEM团队多样性和包容性方面的转变潜力。利用生成性人工智能，本文概述了两个推进多样性、公平与包容的主要领域。首先，通过包容性分析，规范化合作评估可以捕捉细粒度学习者行为。其次，个性化的自适应人工智能系统可以支持STEM团队的多样性与包容性。四个政策建议突显了人工智能的能力：规范化合作技能评估、包容性分析、为社会认知研究筹集资金、人工智能与人类团队合作进行包容性培训。研究人员、教育者、决策者可以共同构建一个公平的STEM生态系统。",
