    "translated_abstract": "在物联网应用的背景下，有效的解决地面蜂窝网络中的智能数据收集方案至关重要。地面基站的有限频谱和覆盖范围给网络用户的数据率需求带来了挑战。无人机以其高敏捷性、移动性和灵活性而闻名，为卸载地面基站的数据流量提供了另一种手段，成为额外的接入点。本文介绍了一种新颖的方法，以有效地最大化多个无人机在卸载地面基站的数据流量方面的利用率。具体而言，重点是在质量保证约束下，通过联合优化无人机轨迹和用户关联指标，最大化用户与无人机的关联。由于所制定的无人机控制问题是非凸和组合的，本研究利用多智能体强化学习框架。在该框架中，每个无人机以非合作方式寻求从环境中学习，并通过学习来优化自己的策略.",
