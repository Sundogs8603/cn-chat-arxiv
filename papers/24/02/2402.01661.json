    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的方法，用于检测大型语料库中的思想影响。利用大型语言模型在编码语义和结构意义方面的独特优势，并在保持对换句方式鲁棒性的同时，我们可以以计算高效的方式搜索具有实质性相似思想和思想影响迹象。这种方法允许我们操作不同的置信水平：我们可以允许直接引用、改写或推测性相似性，同时对每个阈值的限制保持开放态度。我应用了综合方法，结合了通用文本嵌入、一种优化捕捉语义内容的最先进的句子嵌入方法，以及一种用于捕捉论证风格和隐喻使用上结构相似性的抽象意义表示图表示法。我将这种方法应用于大约400,000本非小说书籍和学术出版物的语料库中以向量化句子。",
