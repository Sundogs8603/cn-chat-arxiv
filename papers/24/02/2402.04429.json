    "abstract": "What happens if selective colleges change their admission policies? We answer this question by analyzing the world's first introduction of nationally centralized meritocratic admissions in the early twentieth century. We find a persistent meritocracy-equity tradeoff. Compared to the decentralized system, the centralized system admitted more high-achieving applicants, producing a greater number of top elite bureaucrats in the long run. However, this impact came at the distributional cost of equal regional access to elite higher education and career advancement. Several decades later, the meritocratic centralization increased the number of urban-born career elites (e.g., top income earners) relative to rural-born ones.",

    "translated_abstract": "如果精英学院改变他们的入学政策会发生什么？通过分析20世纪初全球首次引入全国中央化的优质招生制度，我们回答了这个问题。我们发现存在持久的优质教育与公平之间的权衡。相较于分散化系统，中央化系统录取了更多优秀的申请者，在长期内产生了更多顶尖精英官僚。然而，这种影响以公平地区接触精英高等教育和职业晋升的代价为代表。几十年后，优质教育的集中化增加了城市出生的职业精英（例如，高收入者）相对于农村出生的数量。",

The centralized system admitted more high-achieving applicants, leading to a greater number of top elite bureaucrats in the long run, but at the cost of unequal access to elite higher education and career advancement. Several decades later, the centralized meritocracy also resulted in a higher number of urban-born career elites compared to rural-born individuals."
