    "translated_title": "预测基因突变的功能丧失影响：一种机器学习方法",
    "translated_abstract": "下一代测序(NGS)技术的创新大大降低了基因组测序的价格，降低了未来医学研究的门槛；现在可以将基因组测序应用于以前成本效益低的研究中。在大量复杂的高维基因组测序数据中识别有害或致病突变对研究人员可能特别感兴趣。因此，本文旨在训练机器学习模型，使用基因突变的属性来预测LoFtool评分（衡量基因对功能丧失突变的不耐受性）。这些属性包括但不限于突变在染色体上的位置、氨基酸的变化以及突变引起的密码子的变化。使用单变量特征选择技术f-regression结合K最近邻（KNN）、支持向量机（SVM）、随机抽样共识（RANSAC）、决策树、逻辑回归等构建模型。",
    "tldr": "本研究使用机器学习的方法，根据基因突变的属性预测了功能丧失影响，为识别有害突变提供了新的手段。"
