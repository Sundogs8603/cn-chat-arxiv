    "translated_abstract": "生活质量（QoL）的概念涉及对个体福祉的整体评估，包括心理和社会方面。怀孕的妇女，特别是那些肥胖和压力较大的妇女，常常体验到较低的生活质量。体育活动（PA）显示出增强生活质量的潜力。然而，超重和肥胖的孕妇很少达到推荐的体育活动水平。研究已经使用基于相关性的方法调查了怀孕期间体育活动与生活质量之间的关系。这些方法旨在发现变量之间的偶然相关性，而不是因果关系。此外，现有方法主要依赖于体育活动参数，忽略了使用不同因素（如母亲的医学史）和上下文数据，导致估计有偏差。此外，估计缺乏对可能影响它们的中介变量和反事实情景的理解。在本文中，我们进行了调查...",
