    "translated_abstract": "预训练的代码语言模型（Code-PLMs）在过去几年中展示了许多进展，并在许多软件工程任务中取得了最先进的结果。这些模型主要针对流行的编程语言，如Java和Python，而排除了许多其他语言，如R。尽管R拥有广泛的开发者和用户社区，但对Code-PLMs在R中的适用性了解甚少。在本初步研究中，我们旨在调查Code-PLMs在R中的代码实体的易受攻击性。为此，我们使用了一个包含代码和注释对的R数据集，然后应用CodeAttack，一个利用代码结构生成对抗性代码样本的黑盒攻击模型。我们研究了该模型如何攻击R中的不同实体。这是了解R令牌类型相对于流行的编程语言（如Java）重要性的第一步。我们将研究范围限制在代码摘要上。我们的结果显示，最易受攻击的代码实体是",
