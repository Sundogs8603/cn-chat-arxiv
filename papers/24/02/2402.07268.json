    "translated_abstract": "生物标志物的识别对于精确的疾病诊断和理解疾病发病机制在组学数据分析中至关重要，比如使用折叠变化和回归分析。图神经网络（GNNs）是分析图结构数据的主要深度学习模型。然而，我们发现现有GNNs在组学数据分析中存在两个主要限制，即预测（诊断）准确性有限和在多个数据集中可重复的生物标志物识别能力有限。这些挑战的根源在于生物信号通路的独特图结构，其中包括大量的靶点和这些靶点之间密集而复杂的信号交互。为了解决这两个挑战，在本研究中，我们提出了一种名为PathFormer的新型GNN模型架构，它系统地整合信号网络、先验知识和组学数据来对生物标志物进行排名和预测疾病诊断。在比较结果中，PathFormer表现优于现有方法。",
