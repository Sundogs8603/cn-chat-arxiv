    "translated_abstract": "虽然大型语言模型（LMs）表现出色，但当需要查询其预训练记忆之外的信息时，它们在提供准确回答时会遇到挑战。虽然利用相关外部信息来增强它们可以缓解这些问题，但未考虑检索的必要性可能会对整体性能产生负面影响。此前的研究主要关注实体如何影响检索模型与LMs中的知识回忆，其他方面相对未被探索。本研究旨在通过探索实体和关系组合的影响来提供更详细、以事实为中心的分析。为实现这一目标，我们构建了一个名为WiTQA（Wikipedia Triple Question Answers）的新问题回答（QA）数据集。此数据集包括关于不同受欢迎程度实体和关系的问题，每个问题都附带一段支持性段落。",
