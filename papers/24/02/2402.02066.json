    "translated_abstract": "$\\mathbb{X}$（以前的Twitter）是一个重要的在线社交媒体平台，在信息共享方面起着重要作用，使得该平台生成的内容成为有价值的信息来源。确保$\\mathbb{X}$上的信任是确定用户的可信度并防止各个领域出现问题的关键。尽管使用传统机器学习模型将可信度分配给$\\mathbb{X}$用户并将其分类为可信或不可信是常见做法，但对于使用一类分类（OCC）模型进行这一目的的探索有限。在本研究中，我们使用各种OCC模型对$\\mathbb{X}$用户进行分类。此外，我们提出使用基于子空间学习的方法，同时优化子空间和数据描述以用于OCC。我们还引入了一种新颖的正则化项用于子空间支持向量数据描述（SSVDD），以表达低维子空间中的数据集中度，捕捉多样性。",
