In order to tackle these challenges, we introduce CARBD-Ko (a Contextually Annotated Review Benchmark Dataset for Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification in Korean), a benchmark dataset that incorporates aspects and dual-tagged polarities to distinguish between aspect-specific and aspect-agnostic sentiment classification. The dataset consists of sentences annotated with specific aspects, aspect polarity, aspect-agnostic polarity, and the intensity of aspects. To address the issue of dual-tagged aspect polarities, we propose a novel approach employing a Siamese Network. Our experimental findings highlight the inherent difficulties in accurately predicting dual-polarities and underscore the significance of contextualized sentiment analysis mod",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文探讨了在预训练语言模型（PLMs）中面向方面的情感分类（ABSC）所面临的挑战，特别关注了上下文化和幻觉问题。为了解决这些挑战，我们引入了CARBD-Ko（用于韩文方面级别情感分类的情境注释评论基准数据集），这是一个基准数据集，它结合了方面和双标极性，以区分特定方面和方面不可知情感分类。该数据集包含了用特定方面、方面极性、方面不可知极性和方面强度进行注释的句子。为了解决双标方面极性的问题，我们提出了一种采用孪生网络的新方法。我们的实验结果突出了准确预测双极性的固有困难性，并强调了情境化情感分析模型的重要性。",
