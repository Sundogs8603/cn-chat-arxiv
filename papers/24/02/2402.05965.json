    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了球面数据的混合神经表示，这是科学研究中越来越相关的领域。我们的工作重点是天气和气候数据以及宇宙微波背景（CMB）数据。尽管以前的研究探索了基于坐标的球形信号神经表示，但它们经常无法捕捉到高度非线性信号的复杂细节。为了解决这个限制，我们引入了一种名为混合神经表示球面数据（HNeR-S）的新方法。我们的主要思想是使用球形特征格来获取位置特征，然后与多层感知器结合来预测目标信号。我们考虑了与天气数据和CMB数据对齐的等距像素化结构的等矩形和等面积隔等纬度特征格。我们广泛验证了我们的HNeR-S在回归、超分辨率、时间插值和压缩方面的有效性",
