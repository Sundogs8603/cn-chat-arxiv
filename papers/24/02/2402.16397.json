    "translated_abstract": "生成式神经网络的兴起引发了对生成内容知识产权（IP）保护的增加需求。深度水印技术以其在IP保护中的灵活性而备受关注。然而，对抗性可迁移攻击的激增给深度水印技术的安全性带来了前所未有的挑战，这个领域目前缺乏系统的研究。本研究通过引入两种有效的可迁移攻击者来评估深度水印在面对擦除和篡改风险时的脆弱性来填补这一空白。具体来说，我们首先定义了局部样本密度的概念，并利用它推导出有关模型输出一致性的定理。在发现将样本扰动至目标类别高密度区域（HSDR）有助于增强有针对性的对抗可迁移性后，我们提出了Easy Sample Selection (ESS) 机制。",
