Interestingly, our results show that a single-agent LLM with strong prompts can achieve almost the same performance as the best existing discussion approach on a wide range of reasoning tasks and backbone LLMs. We observe that the multi-agent discussion performs better than a single agent only when there is no demonstration in the prompt.

    "translated_abstract": "LLM讨论领域的最新进展表明，多智能体讨论提升了LLM的推理能力。在这项工作中，我们通过系统实验对这一说法进行重新评估，我们提出了一个新颖的小组讨论框架，丰富了讨论机制集合。有趣的是，我们的结果显示，一个带有强提示的单智能体LLM在广泛的推理任务和基本LLM中几乎可以达到与最佳现有讨论方法相同的性能。我们观察到，多智能体讨论仅在提示中没有演示时才优于单个智能体。进一步研究揭示了LLM在讨论过程中的常见交互机制。",
