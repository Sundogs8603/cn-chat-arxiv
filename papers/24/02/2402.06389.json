    "translated_abstract": "随着神经生成能力的进步，艺术界积极采用GenAI（生成性人工智能）来创作绘画内容。大型的文本到图像模型能够快速生成美观的结果。然而，这个过程可能是非确定性的，并且常常需要耗费大量的试误，因为用户在构思有效的提示来达到他们想要的结果时会遇到困难。本文提出了一种无提示的生成方法，使用户能够自动生成个性化的艺术风格的绘画内容，这些内容融入了他们的审美偏好。该方法包括利用“语义注入”来定制特定艺术风格的艺术家模型，并进一步利用遗传算法通过实时迭代的人类反馈来优化提示生成过程。通过仅依靠用户对艺术家模型生成的图像的审美评价和偏好，这个方法可实现个性化的图像生成过程。",
