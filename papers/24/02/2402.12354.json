    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.12354v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: In this paper, we show that Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as originally introduced in Hu et al. (2021) leads to suboptimal finetuning of models with large width (embedding dimension). This is due to the fact that adapter matrices A and B in LoRA are updated with the same learning rate. Using scaling arguments for large width networks, we demonstrate that using the same learning rate for A and B does not allow efficient feature learning. We then show that this suboptimality of LoRA can be corrected simply by setting different learning rates for the LoRA adapter matrices A and B with a well-chosen ratio. We call this proposed algorithm LoRA$+$. In our extensive experiments, LoRA$+$ improves performance (1-2 $\\%$ improvements) and finetuning speed (up to $\\sim$ 2X SpeedUp), at the same computational cost as LoRA.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们展示了低秩适应（LoRA）最初由胡等人（2021年）引入，导致对具有大宽度（嵌入维度）的模型进行微调时表现亚优。这是因为LoRA中的适配器矩阵A和B使用相同的学习率进行更新。通过对大宽度网络进行缩放参数的论证，我们展示了对适配器矩阵A和B使用相同的学习率不利于有效的特征学习。然后，我们表明LoRA的这种次优性可以简单地通过为LoRA适配器矩阵A和B设置不同的学习率以及一个精心选择的比率来进行校正。我们将这个提出的算法称为LoRA$+$。在我们广泛的实验证明中，LoRA$+$在相同计算成本下提高了性能（1-2％的改进）和微调速度（最多提速约2倍）。",
