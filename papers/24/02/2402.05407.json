    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）已经成为一种隐私保护的机器学习范 Paradigm，可以在不共享本地数据的情况下进行多个客户端的协作训练。尽管边缘设备能力的增强，但通信瓶颈导致在聚合大量客户端时出现挑战；每次全局聚合时，只有一部分客户端能够更新其参数。这种现象给FL中的慢速节点（stragglers）带来了重要的挑战，并且客户端调度策略对全局模型收敛性和稳定性有着深远影响。现有的调度策略解决了滞后性问题，但主要集中在及时性或内容上。在此基础上，我们引入了Version Age of Information（VAoI）的新概念来应用于FL。与传统的信息年龄度量不同，VAoI同时考虑了及时性和内容滞后。每个客户端的版本年龄以离散方式进行更新，表示信息的新鲜程度。VAoI被纳入到客户端调度中。",
