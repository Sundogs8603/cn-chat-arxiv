We show that, in the critical window, the point-to-point partition functions converge to a unique limiting random measure, which we call the critical disordered pinning measure. We also obtain an analogous result for a continuous counterpart to the pinning model, which is closely related to two other models: one is a critical stochastic Volterra equation that gives rise to a rough volatility model, and the other is a critical stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise that is white in time and delta in space.",
