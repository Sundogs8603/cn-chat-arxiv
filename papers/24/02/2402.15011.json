    "translated_abstract": "我们将脑-人工智能界面（BAIs）作为一种新的脑-计算机界面（BCIs）类别引入。不同于依赖完好认知功能的传统BCIs，BAIs利用人工智能的力量来替代神经-认知处理管线的部分。BAIs允许用户通过提供高层意图来完成复杂任务，而经过预训练的AI代理确定低层次细节。该方法将BCIs的目标受众扩大到认知功能受损的个体，这是常常被排除在传统BCIs好处之外的人群。我们提出了BAIs的一般概念，并通过基于脑电图的对话式BAI展示了这种新方法的潜力。特别是，我们在模拟电话对话的实验中展示了对话式BAI能够实现复杂通信，而无需生成语言。因此，我们的工作首次证明了，对于第一次，",
