    "translated_abstract": "链接预测是图机器学习中的一项关键任务，其目标是推断图中缺失或未来的链接。传统方法利用基于广泛观察到的连接模式的启发式方法，具有广泛的适用性和泛化性，无需进行模型训练。尽管这些方法很有用，但它们受制于人为推导的启发式方法，缺乏数据驱动方法的适应性。相反，参数链接预测器擅长于从数据中自动学习连接模式并取得最先进的效果，但在不同图之间直接转移上存在问题。相反，它需要进行大量的训练和超参数优化来适应目标图。在这项工作中，我们介绍了通用链接预测器（UniLP），这是一种新颖的模型，将启发式方法的广泛适用性与参数模型的模式学习能力相结合。UniLP设计为自主学习目标图中的链接模式，并具有跨不同图的泛化能力。",
