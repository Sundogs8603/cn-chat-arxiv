    "translated_abstract": "持续的测试时间自适应（CTTA）要求在适应不断变化的未知领域的同时保留先前学到的知识。然而，尽管CTTA取得了一些进展，但忘记适应权衡和效率仍未得到探索。此外，当前的CTTA场景仅假设存在不相交的情况，而实际世界的领域是无缝变化的。为了解决这些挑战，本文提出了一种名为BECoTTA的基于输入的高效CTTA框架。我们提出了MoDE（Mixture-of-Domain Low-rank Experts），它包含两个核心组件：i）领域自适应路由，通过多个领域路由器有选择地捕捉领域自适应知识，和ii）领域专家协同损失，以增加每个领域和专家之间的依赖性。我们验证了我们的方法优于多个CTTA场景，包括不相交和渐变领域切换，同时只需要大约98％更少的可训练参数。",
