    "translated_abstract": "几何亚式期权是一种期权类型，其回报取决于一定时间段内基础资产的几何平均值。本文关注的是在Volterra-Heston模型类中对此类期权的定价，涵盖了粗糙Heston模型。我们得到了这类随机波动率模型中固定和浮动执行价格的几何亚式期权价格的半封闭式公式。这些公式需要明确计算股价对数和股价几何平均对数的条件联合Fourier变换。将我们的问题联系到仿射Volterra过程理论，我们将这个Fourier变换表示为一个适当构造的随机指数，其取决于Riccati-Volterra方程的解。最后，我们在粗糙Heston模型中对我们的结果进行了数值研究。",
