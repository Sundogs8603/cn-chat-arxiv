    "translated_abstract": "最近的MetaBBO方法利用神经网络来元学习传统黑盒优化器的配置。尽管这些方法取得了成功，但它们不可避免地受到预定义手工优化器的限制。本文中，我们提出了一种名为\\textsc{Symbol}的新框架，通过符号方程学习来促进黑盒优化器的自动发现。具体而言，我们提出了一个符号方程生成器(SEG)，允许为特定任务和优化步骤动态生成闭式优化规则。在\\textsc{Symbol}内部，我们基于强化学习开发了三种不同的策略，以便高效地元学习SEG。大量实验证明，\\textsc{Symbol}生成的优化器不仅超越了最先进的BBO和MetaBBO基准线，而且在完全不同问题的全新任务上表现出了异常的零样本泛化能力。",
