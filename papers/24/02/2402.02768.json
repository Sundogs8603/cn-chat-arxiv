    "translated_abstract": "为了有效地表达和满足网络应用的需求，基于意图的网络管理作为一种有前景的解决方案出现了。在基于意图的方法中，用户和应用程序使用高级抽象语言来表达他们的意图。尽管这种抽象简化了网络操作，但它对于有效地表达应用程序的意图并将其映射到不同的网络能力提出了许多挑战。因此，在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于人工智能的意图概要和翻译框架。我们考虑到一个场景，在这个场景中，与网络交互的应用程序使用他们的领域语言来表达他们对网络服务的需求。机器与机器之间的通信（即应用程序与网络之间的通信）是复杂的，因为它要求网络学习如何理解每个应用程序的领域语言，这既不实际也不可伸缩。相反，我们提出了一个基于新兴通信的意图概要框架，用于应用程序的意图概要。",
