    "translated_abstract": "在实现到2050年零排放目标的过程中，采用碳税或发展碳市场等放置碳定价的政策措施被广泛使用。本文探讨了如何在欧盟排放交易体系（EU ETS）内对每月真实碳价格进行点、变动方向和密度预测的问题。我们旨在揭示供给和需求两方面的力量，以提高模型在短期和中期的预测准确性。我们展示了一个简单的贝叶斯向量自回归（BVAR）模型，加上一个或两个能够影响碳价格的预测因子，可以在多个基准预测中提供显著的准确性提升，包括调查预期和数据提供者提供的预测。我们还扩展了对核实排放的研究，并证明在这种情况下，添加随机波动性可以进一步提高单因素BVAR模型的预测性能。",
