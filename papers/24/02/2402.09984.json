While often simple for humans, this can be challenging for AI agents. For example, if an AI agent learns to drive alongside others (a training set) that only drive on one side of the road, it may struggle to adapt this experience to coordinate with drivers on the opposite side, even if their behaviours are simply flipped along the left-right symmetry. To address this we introduce symmetry-breaking augmentations (SBA), which increases diversity in the behaviour of training teammates by applying a symmetry-flipping operation. By learning a best-response to the augmented set of teammates, our agent is exposed to a wider range of behavioural conventions, improving performance when deployed with novel teammates.

    "translated_abstract": "在许多协作环境中，人工智能（AI）代理必须能够适应使用未知或先前未观察到的策略的新队友。对于AI代理来说，这通常对人类来说很简单，但却是一项具有挑战性的任务。例如，如果一个AI代理在训练集中学会了与只在一侧道路上行驶的其他车辆并行驶，那么即使这些车辆的行为只是在左右对称上进行了翻转，它也可能难以适应与相反方向上行驶的驾驶员进行协调。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了对称破缺增强（SBA），通过应用对称翻转操作来增加训练队友的行为多样性。通过学习对增强后的队友的最佳响应，我们的代理能够接触到更广泛的行为约定，从而提高与新队友合作时的性能。我们在两个设置中进行了实验验证，并证明了我们的方法的有效性。",
