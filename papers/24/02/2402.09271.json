    "translated_abstract": "有害藻类水华是高浓度藻类的突发事件，对人类的食用有潜在的毒性。贝类养殖业可能受到有害藻类水华的影响，因为贝类作为过滤食物的动物，能够在其体内积累高浓度的海洋生物毒素。为了避免人类食用的风险，当检测到毒性时会禁止收割。目前，生产区域的关闭是基于专家知识，并且当条件复杂且无法进行采样时，预测模型的存在将有所帮助。虽然肉类中毒素的浓度是控制贝类生产区域的专家最常用的方法，但很少被自动预测模型用作目标。这在很大程度上是由于建立的采样计划导致数据的不规则性。作为替代方案，提出了生产区域的活动状态作为基于该区域是否存在有害藻类水华的目标变量。",
    "tldr": "本论文提出了一种将混合机器学习技术应用于有害藻类水华管理的方法，通过预测生产区域的活动状态来替代常规的毒素浓度检测方法，以解决采样不可能的情况下的风险预测问题。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a hybrid machine learning approach for managing harmful algal blooms, by predicting the activity status of production areas instead of using traditional toxin concentration detection methods, to address the issue of risk prediction when sampling is not feasible."
