    "translated_abstract": "有害藻华细胞损害(DSP)是一种全球健康威胁，源于贝类受到甲藻产生的毒素污染。这种疾病由于普遍性发生、高致病率和贝类持续的毒性，对公共卫生和贝类产业构成危险。毒素产生藻类生物量高的情况，如DSP，被称为有害藻华细胞损害(HABs)。监测和预测系统对于减轻HABs影响至关重要。预测有害藻华细胞损害涉及一个以时间序列为基础的问题，其中有一个强烈的历史季节性组成部分，然而，近期由于气象和海洋事件变化而引起的异常现象已被观察到。流式学习是解决具有概念漂移的时间序列问题的最有希望的方法之一。然而，其在预测HABs方面的有效性尚未得到证明，并且需要与批处理学习进行比较测试。",
