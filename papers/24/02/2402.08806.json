However, even LLMs specifically trained on medical topics may lack sufficient diagnostic accuracy for real-life applications.   Methods: Using collective intelligence methods and a dataset of 200 clinical vignettes of real-life cases, we assessed and compared the accuracy of differential diagnoses obtained by asking individual commercial LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4, Google PaLM 2, Cohere Command, Meta Llama 2) against the accuracy of differential diagnoses synthesized by aggregating responses from combinations of the same LLMs.   Results: We find that aggregating responses from multiple, various LLMs leads to more accurate differential diagnoses (average accuracy for 3 LLMs: $75.3\\%\\pm 1.6pp$) compared to the differential diagnoses produced by single LLMs (aver",

    "translated_abstract": "背景：大型语言模型（LLMs）如OpenAI的GPT-4或Google的PaLM 2被提议作为可行的诊断支持工具，甚至被称为“路边咨询”的替代品。然而，即使特别针对医学主题进行训练的LLMs可能在实际应用中缺乏足够的诊断准确性。方法：使用集体智慧方法和200个真实病例的临床情境数据集，我们评估并比较了通过询问单个商业LLMs（OpenAI GPT-4、Google PaLM 2、Cohere Command、Meta Llama 2）获得的鉴别诊断的准确性与通过聚合相同LLMs的响应获得的鉴别诊断的准确性。",
