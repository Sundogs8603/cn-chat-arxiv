    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，涌现了许多新的开源模型和商业模型。虽然最近的出版物探讨了GPT-4在从放射学报告中提取感兴趣信息方面的应用，但尚未对GPT-4与不同领先的开源模型进行实际比较。本研究使用了两个不同的独立数据集。第一个数据集包括了2019年7月至2021年7月在马萨诸塞州综合医院创建的540份胸部X射线报告。第二个数据集包含了来自ImaGenome数据集的500份胸部X射线报告。然后，我们比较了商业模型GPT-3.5 Turbo和GPT-4与开源模型Mistral-7B、Mixtral-8x7B、Llama2-13B、Llama2-70B、QWEN1.5-72B以及CheXbert和CheXpert-labeler在准确标记X射线文本报告中多发现存在的能力。",
