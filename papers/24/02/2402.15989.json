    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们解决了transformer架构的两个主要缺点：输入损坏和输出表示中的秩坍缩。我们揭示了自注意力作为自主状态空间模型，在其解决方案中固有地促进平滑性，导致较低秩的输出和降低的表示容量。此外，模型的稳态解对输入扰动敏感。我们将一个比例-积分-微分（PID）闭环反馈控制系统与一个参考点整合到模型中，以提高鲁棒性和表示容量。这种集成旨在在加强模型稳定性的同时保留高频细节，使其更具抗噪性。最终得到的受控状态空间模型在理论上被证明是稳健的，并擅长解决秩崩溃问题。在这种控制框架的推动下，我们推导出了一类新型transformers，即PID-controlled Transformer（PIDformer）。",
