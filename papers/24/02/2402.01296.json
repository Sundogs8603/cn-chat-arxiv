    "translated_abstract": "隐私保护的神经网络近年来引起了越来越多的关注，人们从加密的角度开发了各种算法，以在准确性、计算复杂度和信息安全之间保持平衡。本研究从输入数据和神经网络的结构出发，将输入数据（例如一些图像）根据重要性和隐私划分为敏感和不敏感的部分。敏感的部分包含一些重要和私密的信息，如人脸，我们使用强同态加密来保持安全性，而不敏感的部分则包含一些背景信息，我们添加扰动。我们提出了bi-CryptoNets，即明文和密文分支，分别处理两个部分，并且密文分支可以通过单向连接利用明文分支的信息。我们通过知识蒸馏来训练我们的bi-CryptoNets，从一个w上进行表示的传递。",
