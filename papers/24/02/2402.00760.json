    "translated_abstract": "本研究通过使用基于噪声对比先验（BNN-NCP）技术的贝叶斯神经网络，成功生成了对EuroPED等离子体底座模型的不确定性感知的代理模型，并使用来自JET-ILW底座数据库和后续模型评估的数据进行验证。这些代理模型称为EuroPED-NN。BNN-NCP技术被证明是适用于不确定性感知的代理模型的好选择，与普通神经网络相同的输出结果，提供预测的置信度作为不确定性，并利用代理模型的不确定性突出显示出分布范围外（OOD）区域。这为模型的稳健性和可靠性提供了关键见解。EuroPED-NN已经得到了物理验证，首先通过分析电子密度$n_e\\!\\left(\\psi_{\\text{pol}}=0.94\\right)$随等离子体电流$I_p$的增加而变化，并验证了与EuroPED模型相关的$\\Delta-\\beta_{p,ped}$关系。这证实了代理模型所学到的底层物理学的稳健性。",
