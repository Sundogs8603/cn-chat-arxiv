    "translated_abstract": "随着未来音乐人工智能越来越紧密地遵循人类音乐，它们可能会对数据库中的特定人类艺术家产生自己的偏爱，而这些偏见在最坏的情况下可能会导致对所有音乐历史的潜在存在威胁。 AI的超级粉丝可能会采取行动来扭曲历史记录和现有录音，以符合他们自己的喜好，世界音乐文化的多样性的保存可能会成为一个比12平均律或其他西方同质化问题更加紧迫的问题。我们讨论了AI覆盖软件的技术能力，并制作了一些西方流行音乐历史上著名曲目的泰勒版本作为挑衅性的例子；这些制作的质量并不影响总体论点（甚至可能会看到未来的AI尝试将订书钉的声音强加到所有现有音频文件上，更不用说泰勒·斯威夫特了）。我们讨论了一些未来危险的潜在防御措施",
