    "translated_abstract": "电动汽车制造之中，根本原因分析(RCA)是识别故障原因的过程。传统上，RCA是依靠过程专家知识手工进行的。同时，传感器网络在制造过程中收集了大量的数据，利用这些数据进行RCA能够提高效率。然而，纯数据驱动的方法(如因果贝叶斯网络)在大规模的实际制造过程中具有扩展性问题，因为存在大量的潜在因果关系(CERs)。此外，纯数据驱动的方法有可能忽略已知的CERs或学习到错误的CERs。本文提出了一个互动智能的RCA工具，将电动汽车制造过程的专家知识和数据驱动的机器学习方法相结合。该工具利用制造过程的大规模知识图谱进行推理，同时学习一个因果贝叶斯网络。",
