However, crafting formulas on spreadsheets remains a tedious and error-prone task for many end-users, particularly when dealing with complex operations. To alleviate the burden associated with writing spreadsheet formulas, this paper introduces a novel benchmark task called NL2Formula, with the aim to generate executable formulas that are grounded on a spreadsheet table, given a Natural Language (NL) query as input. To accomplish this, we construct a comprehensive dataset consisting of 70,799 paired NL queries and corresponding spreadsheet formulas, covering 21,670 tables and 37 types of formula functions. We realize the NL2Formula task by providing a sequence-to-sequence baseline implementation called fCoder. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of fCoder, demonstrating its superior per",

    "translated_abstract": "在电子表格上编写公式，如Microsoft Excel和Google Sheets，是许多进行数据分析的用户广泛使用的做法。然而，对于许多最终用户来说，制作电子表格公式仍然是一项繁琐且容易出错的任务，特别是在处理复杂操作时。为了减轻编写电子表格公式所带来的负担，本文介绍了一个称为NL2Formula的新型基准任务，旨在根据输入的自然语言（NL）查询生成基于电子表格的可执行公式。为此，我们构建了一个包含70,799个配对NL查询和相应电子表格公式的全面数据集，涵盖21,670个表格和37种公式函数类型。我们通过提供一个称为fCoder的基于序列到序列的基准实现来实现NL2Formula任务。实验结果验证了fCoder的有效性，证明了其出色的性能。",
