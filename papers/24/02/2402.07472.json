    "translated_abstract": "机器学习原子间势正在革新材料科学和化学中的大规模、准确的原子模拟。这些势函数通常使用原子团簇展开或变换消息传递与球谐基函数。然而，为了保持旋转对称性，依赖Clebsch-Gordan系数会导致计算效率低下和冗余。我们提出一种替代方法：基于笛卡尔坐标的原子密度展开。该方法在保持相互作用体系的同时提供了对原子环境的完整描述。此外，我们还整合了各种化学元素的低维嵌入和原子间消息传递。所得到的势函数被命名为Cartesian Atomic Cluster Expansion(CACE)，具有良好的准确性、稳定性和普适性。我们在不同系统中进行验证，包括大规模水、小分子和25种元素高熵合金。",
