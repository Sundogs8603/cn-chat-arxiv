However, ordinary users lack the professional skills to produce high-quality videos using professional creation software. To meet the demand for intelligent and user-friendly video creation tools, we propose the Dynamic Visual Composition (DVC) task, an interesting and challenging task that aims to automatically integrate various media elements based on user requirements and create storytelling videos. We propose an Intelligent Director framework, utilizing LENS to generate descriptions for images and video frames and combining ChatGPT to generate coherent captions while recommending appropriate music names. Then, the best-matched music is obtained through music retrieval. Then, materials such as captions, images, videos, and music are integrated to seamlessly synthesize the ",

    "translated_abstract": "随着以TikTok为代表的短视频平台的兴起，用户通过照片和视频表达创意的趋势急剧增加。然而，普通用户缺乏使用专业创作软件制作高质量视频的专业技能。为满足智能且用户友好的视频创作工具的需求，我们提出了动态视觉构图（DVC）任务，这是一个有趣且具有挑战性的任务，旨在根据用户需求自动整合各种媒体元素并创建叙事视频。我们提出了一个智能导演框架，利用LENS为图像和视频帧生成描述，结合ChatGPT生成连贯字幕同时推荐适当的音乐名称。然后，通过音乐检索获得最佳匹配的音乐。接着，字幕、图像、视频和音乐等素材被整合起来，无缝合成。",
