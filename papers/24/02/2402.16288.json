Our research introduces PerLTQA, an innovative QA dataset that combines semantic and episodic memories, including world knowledge, profiles, social relationships, events, and dialogues. This dataset is collected to investigate the use of personalized memories, focusing on social interactions and events in the QA task. PerLTQA features two types of memory and a comprehensive benchmark of 8,593 questions for 30 characters, facilitating the exploration and application of personalized memories in Large Language Models (LLMs). Based on PerLTQA, we propose a novel framework for memory integration and generation, consisting of three main components: Memory Classification, Memory Retrieval, and Memory Synthesis. We evaluate this framework using five LLMs and thre",

    "translated_abstract": "长期记忆在个人互动中起着至关重要的作用，考虑到长期记忆可以更好地利用世界知识、历史信息和对话中的偏好。我们的研究引入了PerLTQA，一个创新的QA数据集，结合了语义和情节记忆，包括世界知识、用户资料、社会关系、事件和对话。这个数据集被收集用于探讨个性化记忆在QA任务中的应用，重点关注社交互动和事件。PerLTQA具有两种记忆类型和一个包含8,593个问题的30个字符的全面基准，促进了在大型语言模型（LLM）中探索和应用个性化记忆。基于PerLTQA，我们提出了一个记忆整合和生成的新框架，包括三个主要组成部分：记忆分类、记忆检索和记忆合成。我们使用五个LLM和三个评估了这个框架。",
