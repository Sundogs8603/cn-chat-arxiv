    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究确认了使用惯性测量单元（IMU）的系统对于人体运动分析的适用性。然而，高端的商业化IMU解决方案价格昂贵且复杂，无法普及在广大潜在用户中的使用。市场上出现了一些功能较少的低端商业化解决方案，试图填补这一空白，但仍存在一些需要克服的限制。与此同时，在医疗和运动应用领域，越来越多的科学论文使用的是非商业化的、自制的IMU系统。尽管这些解决方案可以促进这项技术的普及化使用，但它们的功能更为有限，并且如何设计和构建它们的描述在文献中仍然稀缺。本文的目的是：（1）证明构建一种可负担的定制解决方案是可行的，旨在同时追踪多个人体部位的定向和运动。",
