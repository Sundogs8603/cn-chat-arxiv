    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an Android application to control and monitor the physiological sensors from the Shimmer platform and its synchronized working with a driving simulator. The Android app can monitor drivers and their parameters can be used to analyze the relation between their physiological states and driving performance.

The Android app is synchronized in two steps with a driving simulator that we previously developed using the Unity game engine to analyze driving security and efficiency. The Android app was tested with different sensors working simultaneously at various sampling rates and in different Android devices. We also tested the synchronized working of the driving simulator and the Android app with 25 people and analyzed the relation ",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种安卓应用程序，可以控制和监测来自Shimmer平台的生理传感器，并与驾驶模拟器同步工作。该应用程序可以监测驾驶员，其参数可以用于分析他们的生理状态与驾驶性能之间的关系。该应用程序可以配置、选择、接收、处理、图形化表示和存储来自心电图（ECG）、肌电图（EMG）、皮肤电反应（GSR）模块和加速度计、磁力计和陀螺仪的信号。该安卓应用程序通过两个步骤与我们之前使用Unity游戏引擎开发的驾驶模拟器同步，以分析驾驶安全性和效率。该安卓应用程序在不同采样率和不同安卓设备上同时测试了不同传感器的工作情况。我们还通过与25人一起测试驾驶模拟器和安卓应用程序的同步工作，并分析了两者之间的关系。",
