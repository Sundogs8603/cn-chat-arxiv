    "translated_abstract": "在生物技术中，拉曼光谱法作为一种过程分析技术（PAT）快速得到了广泛应用，它可以测量细胞密度、底物和产物浓度。由于拉曼光谱记录了分子的振动模式，因此可以非侵入性地在一个光谱中提供相关信息。通常，偏最小二乘（PLS）是从光谱中推断感兴趣变量信息的模型选择。然而，生物过程以其复杂性而闻名，其中卷积神经网络（CNN）是一个强大的替代方法。它们可以处理非高斯噪声，并考虑光束错位、像素故障或其他物质的存在。然而，它们在模型训练过程中需要大量数据，并且能够捕捉到过程变量之间的非线性依赖关系。在这项工作中，我们利用光谱的可加性来生成从给定数据集中得到的具有统计独立标签的额外数据点，以便训练网络。",
