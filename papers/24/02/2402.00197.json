    "translated_abstract": "准确检测和分析水中微量持久性有机污染物对于环境监测和食品质量控制等许多领域都是重要的，因为它们具有较长的环境稳定性和潜在的生物积累性。传统的有机污染物分析需要昂贵的设备，而表面增强拉曼光谱（SERS）已经展示了准确检测这些污染物的巨大潜力。然而，SERS分析中的困难，如光谱预处理、去噪和基质引起的光谱变化，阻碍了该技术的广泛应用。在这里，我们通过机器学习的方法，展示了一种从凌乱的、未经处理的拉曼数据中预测样品污染物浓度的方法。频域变换方法，包括傅立叶变换和Walsh-Hadamard变换，被应用于三个模拟微污染物（罗丹明6G、氯氰菊酯和三氯生）在水中的拉曼光谱集合，然后用于训练机器分类器来预测污染物的浓度。",
