    "translated_abstract": "生成式的隐式扩散模型在医学影像领域具有广泛的应用。一个值得注意的应用是通过提出合成数据作为真实患者数据的替代品来实现隐私保护的开放数据共享。尽管有这个应用的前景，但这些模型容易出现患者数据的记忆问题，即模型生成患者数据的副本而不是新的合成样本。这破坏了保护患者数据的整个目的，甚至可能导致患者被重新识别。考虑到这个问题的重要性，令人惊讶的是，在医学影像界中这个问题并没有得到太多关注。为此，我们评估了医学图像合成中隐式扩散模型的记忆问题。我们训练了2D和3D的隐式扩散模型，使用CT、MR和X光数据集进行合成数据的生成。之后，我们利用自监督模型来评估训练数据被记忆的程度，并进一步研究可能导致记忆的各种因素。",
