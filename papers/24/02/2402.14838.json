    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.14838v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Nowadays, the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased, and LLMs have been used to generate texts in different languages and for different tasks. Additionally, due to the participation of remarkable companies such as Google and OpenAI, LLMs are now more accessible, and people can easily use them. However, an important issue is how we can detect AI-generated texts from human-written ones. In this article, we have investigated the problem of AI-generated text detection from two different aspects: semantics and syntax. Finally, we presented an AI model that can distinguish AI-generated texts from human-written ones with high accuracy on both multilingual and monolingual tasks using the M4 dataset. According to our results, using a semantic approach would be more helpful for detection. However, there is a lot of room for improvement in the syntactic approach, and it would be a good approach for future work.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）的使用越来越广泛，并且LLMs已被用于在不同语言和不同任务中生成文本。此外，由于谷歌和OpenAI等知名公司的参与，LLMs现在更易获得，人们可以轻松使用它们。然而，一个重要问题是如何检测AI生成的文本与人类撰写的文本区别。本文从语义和句法两个方面探讨了AI生成文本检测问题。最终，我们提出了一个AI模型，可以在M4数据集上高准确度区分AI生成文本和人类撰写文本，无论是多语言还是单语任务。根据我们的结果，使用语义方法对于检测更有帮助。然而，在句法方法上还有很大改进空间，这将是未来工作的一个良好途径。",
