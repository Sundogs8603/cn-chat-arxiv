    "translated_abstract": "近年来，去噪问题与深度生成模型的发展密不可分。特别是，扩散模型被训练成去噪器，它们所建模的分布与贝叶斯图像中的去噪先验相符。然而，通过基于扩散的后验采样进行去噪需要知道噪声水平和协方差，这阻碍了盲去噪。我们通过引入 Gibbs扩散（GDiff）克服了这一限制，这是一种通用方法论，可以处理信号和噪声参数的后验采样。假设任意参数化的高斯噪声，我们开发了一种Gibbs算法，交替地从条件扩散模型中进行采样，该模型经过训练将信号先验映射到噪声分布族，以及一个蒙特卡洛采样器来推断噪声参数。我们的理论分析突出了潜在的缺陷，指导了诊断的使用，并量化了Gibbs s中的错误。",
