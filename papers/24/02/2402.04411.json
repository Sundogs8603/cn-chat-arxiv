    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Definite Finite Automaton augmented large language model (DFA-LLM), a novel framework designed to enhance the capabilities of conversational agents using large language models (LLMs). Traditional LLMs face challenges in generating regulated and compliant responses in special scenarios with predetermined response guidelines, like emotional support and customer service. Our framework addresses these challenges by embedding a Definite Finite Automaton (DFA), learned from training dialogues, within the LLM. This structured approach enables the LLM to adhere to a deterministic response pathway, guided by the DFA. The advantages of DFA-LLM include an interpretable structure through human-readable DFA, context-aware retrieval for responses in conversations, and plug-and-play compatibility with existing LLMs. Extensive benchmarks validate DFA-LLM's effectiveness, indicating its potential as a valuable contribution to the conversational agent.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种新颖的框架——确定有限自动机增强的大规模语言模型（DFA-LLM），旨在通过使用大规模语言模型（LLM）提升对话代理的能力。传统的LLM在特定情景（如情感支持和客户服务）中生成规范合规的回复面临挑战。我们的框架通过将从训练对话中学习到的确定有限自动机（DFA）嵌入到LLM中来应对这些挑战。这种结构化的方法使得LLM能够按照DFA指导的确定性回应路径来回应。DFA-LLM的优势包括可解释性结构，上下文感知的对话回复检索以及与现有LLM的即插即用兼容性。广泛的基准测试验证了DFA-LLM的有效性，表明它有潜力成为对话代理领域的有价值的贡献。",
