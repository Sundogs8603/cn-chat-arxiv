    "translated_abstract": "时间序列异常检测在Web系统中起着至关重要的作用。各种Web系统依赖时间序列数据来实时监测和识别异常，并启动诊断和修复程序。变分自编码器（VAEs）由于其卓越的降噪能力，在最近几十年中变得越来越受欢迎，这对于异常检测非常有用。然而，我们的研究发现，基于VAE的方法在同时捕捉长周期异质模式和详细短周期趋势方面面临着挑战。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的单变量时间序列无监督异常检测方法：频率增强的条件变分自编码器（FCVAE）。为了确保准确的异常检测，FCVAE采用了一种创新的方法，将全局和局部频率特征同时集成到条件变分自编码器（CVAE）的条件中，从而显著提高了对正常数据的重构精度。",
