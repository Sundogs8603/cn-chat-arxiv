    "translated_abstract": "最近，智能反射面（IRS）辅助的多用户集成感知和通信（ISAC）系统已经被研究以提供高频谱和能量有效性传输。本文首次提出了一个实用的信道估计方法，用于IRS辅助的多用户ISAC系统。在这样的系统中，估计问题具有挑战性，因为感知和通信（SAC）信号相互干扰，被动式的IRS缺乏信号处理能力。本文提出了一个两阶段的方法，将整体估计问题逐步转化为子问题，依次包括直接和反射信道的估计。基于此方案，ISAC基站（BS）估计与目标和上行用户相关的所有SAC信道，而每个下行用户单独估计下行通信信道。考虑到ISAC基站和下行用户的低成本需求，本文的方法具有实用性和可行性。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a channel estimation method for an IRS-assisted multi-user ISAC system based on extreme learning machines, which addresses the challenges of interference between sensing and communication signals and the lack of signal processing ability in passive IRS. The method decomposes the overall estimation problem into sub-problems and allows accurate estimation of SAC channels and downlink communication channels while maintaining low-cost requirements."
