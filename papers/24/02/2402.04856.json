    "translated_abstract": "从人类行为或反馈中学习奖励是将AI系统与人类价值观一致的一种有希望的方法，但无法始终提取正确的奖励函数。可解释性工具可以帮助用户理解和评估学习到的奖励函数中可能存在的缺陷。我们提出了反事实轨迹解释（CTEs），通过对比原始轨迹和反事实部分轨迹以及它们各自接收的奖励来解释强化学习中的奖励函数。我们为CTEs制定了六个质量标准，并提出了一种基于Monte-Carlo的新算法来生成优化这些质量标准的CTEs。最后，我们通过训练代理人模型来衡量生成的解释对其的信息性。CTEs对于代理人模型具有明显的信息性，增加了其预测与未见轨迹上的奖励函数的相似性。此外，它学会了准确判断轨迹之间的奖励差异。",
