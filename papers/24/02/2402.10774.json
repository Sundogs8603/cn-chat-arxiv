    "translated_abstract": "错误反馈（EF）是一种非常流行且极其有效的机制，用于解决分布式训练方法（如分布式GD或SGD）中由于与贪婪通信压缩技术（如TopK）结合而产生的收敛问题。尽管EF提出已有近十年时间（Seide等人，2014年），并且尽管社区为推进对该机制的理论理解而集中努力，仍有很多尚待探索之处。在本文中，我们研究了一种名为EF21（Richtarik等人，2021年）的现代形式的错误反馈，它提供了目前已知的最佳理论保证，在最弱的假设下也在实践中运行良好。特别地，虽然EF21的理论通信复杂度取决于某些平滑度参数的平方均值，我们将这种依赖性改进为它们的算术平均值，后者始终更小，尤其是在...",
