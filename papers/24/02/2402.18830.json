Previous machine learning-based methods are fast but mostly based on supervised learning and require a training set that may be typically expensive in real experimental measurements. Unsupervised learning-based algorithms are slow and require many iterations to achieve convergence. Here, we bridge this gap by proposing a training-set-free two-stage deep learning method. We show that the fuzzy fixed input in previous methods can be improved by introducing an adaptive prior. Combined with more advanced optimization techniques, our approach can achieve five times acceleration compared to previous work.

    "translated_abstract": "去噪是光谱后处理过程中的重要步骤。先前的基于机器学习的方法快速但大多基于监督学习，需要一个训练集，在实际实验测量中可能成本较高。基于无监督学习的算法速度慢，并且需要多次迭代才能收敛。本文通过提出一种无需训练集的两阶段深度学习方法，弥合了这一差距。我们展示了之前方法中模糊固定输入的改进，引入自适应先验。结合更先进的优化技术，我们的方法比前人工作快五倍。理论上，我们研究了相应非凸线性问题的潜在状态，并且结果表明，这个问题对于一阶算法收敛具有良好的几何性质。",
