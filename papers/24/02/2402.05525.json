To achieve this, we introduce DP-MORL, an MBRL algorithm coming with differential privacy guarantees. A private model of the environment is first learned from offline data using DP-FedAvg, a training method for neural networks that provides differential privacy guarantees at the trajectory level. Then, we use model-based policy optimization to derive a policy from the (penalized) private model, without any further interaction with the system or access to the input data. We empirically show that DP-MORL enables the training of private RL agents from offline data and we furthermore outline the price of privacy in this setting.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了具有隐私保证的离线强化学习问题，目标是训练一个相对于数据集中每个轨迹具有差分隐私的策略。为了实现这一目标，我们引入了DP-MORL，一种带有差分隐私保证的MBRL算法。首先，使用DP-FedAvg从离线数据中学习环境的隐私模型，DP-FedAvg是一种为神经网络提供轨迹级差分隐私保证的训练方法。然后，我们使用基于模型的策略优化从（受罚的）隐私模型中推导出策略，无需进一步与系统交互或访问输入数据。我们经验证明，DP-MORL能够从离线数据中训练出具有隐私保护的RL代理，并进一步概述了在这种情况下隐私的代价。",
