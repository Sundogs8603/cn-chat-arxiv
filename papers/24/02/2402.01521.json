    "translated_abstract": "虽然大型语言模型（LLMs）已经展示了其在复杂推理任务上的能力，但在动态、交互和竞争场景（如商业战略和股票市场分析）中的性能仍然未被充分探索。为了填补这个空白，我们正式探索LLMs在快速变化环境中的决策推理能力。我们引入了两个基于博弈论的试验，以模拟现实世界中动态决策的复杂性。这些挑战具有明确定义，可以对LLMs的动态推理能力进行清晰、可控和精确的评估。通过大量实验，我们发现现有的推理方法在需要k级思考的动态环境中容易出错 - 这是之前研究中未解决的关键概念。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的LLMs推理方法，命名为“K级推理”。该方法采用对手的视角，从递归角度运用基于k级思考的推理。",
