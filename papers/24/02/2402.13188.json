    "translated_abstract": "最近许多利用知识图谱（KGs）的模型在问答（QA）任务中展现出显著的成功。现实世界中，KGs中包含的许多事实都是受时间限制的，因此时间KGQA受到越来越多的关注。尽管之前的模型在时间KGQA方面取得了丰硕的成果，但它们仍然存在一些限制：（I）它们采用预训练语言模型（PLMs）来获取问题表示，而PLMs倾向于关注实体信息并忽略由于时间约束引起的实体转移，最终未能学习到实体的特定时间表示。 （II）它们既不强调实体之间的图结构，也没有明确建模图中的多跳关系，这将使复杂的多跳问题回答变得困难。为了缓解这一问题，我们提出了一种新颖的问题校准和多跳建模（QC-MHM）方法。",
