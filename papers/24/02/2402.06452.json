    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习中，使用决策树组合进行预测已被证明是有效的。目前构建决策树组合进行预测的典型方法有bagging和boosting。bagging方法独立构建决策树而不评估它们的组合性能，并在之后进行平均。boosting方法顺序构建决策树，只在每一步评估新决策树与固定过去决策树组合的性能。因此，这两种方法都不直接构建也不评估最终预测的决策树组合的适用性。当最终预测基于多个决策树组合时，在构建过程中评估组合的适用性是很自然的。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新的算法框架，能够同时构建决策树并在构建过程中评估它们的组合性能。我们的框架重复两个步骤。第一步是同时构建多个决策树，第二步是根据组合性能评估这些决策树的适用性，以指导后续的决策树构建。",
