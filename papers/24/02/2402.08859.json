    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人们一直致力于利用文本信息来改善推荐系统中的用户画像和物品描述。然而，文本信息有时质量较低，限制了其在真实世界应用中的效果。将大规模语言模型（LLM）的知识和推理能力用于描述改进成为一种有前景的方法。然而，现有的使用原始文本提示LLM的方法忽略了用户-物品交互的结构化知识，可能导致生成不一致描述的幻觉问题。为此，我们提出了一种基于图的卷积LLM方法，以引导LLM捕捉用户-物品图中的高阶关系。为了使文本为基础的LLM适应结构化图，我们将LLM作为图处理中的聚合器，使其逐步理解基于图的信息。具体地，需要LLM进行描述改进以便更好地进行推荐。",
