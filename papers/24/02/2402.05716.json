    "translated_abstract": "为了描述人口中观察到的财富分布特性，大部分经济模型都依赖于存在渐近平衡状态。此外，产生平衡分布的过程通常被假设符合遍历性，具有有限的渐近平均值和有界的不平等性。在本研究中，我们使用意大利银行对家庭收入和财富的调查数据以及福布斯意大利亿万富翁名单的数据，证明了最后一个假设在意大利并不成立。我们发现，即使存在一个渐近平衡分布，平均财富也没有有限的渐近值。因此，我们发现，在财富演化过程中参数不发生变化的情况下，财富不平等势必随时间发散。此外，我们评估了演化过程的平衡时间，当其参数被选择为既存在平衡分布又存在有限平均财富时。即使在平衡假设成立的情况下，这一过程的平衡时间仍然会很长。",
