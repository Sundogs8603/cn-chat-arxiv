    "translated_abstract": "主动学习（AL）旨在通过选择信息量最大的数据点进行标注，从而在固定的标注预算内提高模型性能。现有的AL方法通常只适用于单一领域的情况，即所有数据都来自同一领域（例如，同一数据集）。然而，许多现实任务往往涉及多个领域。例如，在视觉识别中，通常希望训练一个能够在不同环境（例如，不同背景）中工作的图像分类器，其中每个环境的图像构成一个领域。这种多领域AL设置对于以前的方法来说是具有挑战性的，因为它们（1）在分配标注预算时忽视了不同领域之间的相似性，（2）无法处理不同领域之间的数据分布变化。在本文中，我们提出了第一个通用方法，称为复合主动学习（CAL），用于多领域AL。我们的方法显式地考虑了问题中的领域层级和实例层级信息；CAL首先分配",
