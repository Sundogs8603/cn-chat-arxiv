    "translated_abstract": "大规模语言模型（LLMs）的出现显著推进了真实交互智能体的模拟。然而，维持长时间智能体交互的巨大成本对于部署基于LLM的可信智能体构成了挑战。因此，在本文中，我们开发了经济实惠的生成式智能体（AGA），这是一个框架，可以在智能体-环境和智能体间交互的两个层面上实现低成本的可信互动。具体而言，对于智能体-环境交互，我们用学习的策略替代了重复的LLM推理；而对于智能体间交互，我们对智能体之间的社会关系进行建模，并压缩辅助对话信息。在多个环境上的大量实验表明了我们提出的框架的有效性和效率。此外，我们深入探究了LLM智能体中的可信行为形成机制，证明智能体仅能在固定环境中生成有限行为。",
