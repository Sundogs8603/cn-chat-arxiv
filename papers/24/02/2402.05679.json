    "abstract": "This paper aims to explore the factors stimulating different tourism behaviours, with specific reference to same-day visits and overnight stays. To this aim, we employ mobile network data referred to the area of Lombardy. The paper highlights that larger availability of tourism accommodations, cultural and natural endowments are relevant factors explaining overnight stays. Conversely, temporary entertainment and transportation facilities increase municipalities attractiveness for same-day visits. The results also highlight a trade-off in the capability of municipalities of being attractive in connection to both the tourism behaviours, with higher overnight stays in areas with more limited same-day visits. Mobile data offer a spatial and temporal granularity allowing to detect relevant patterns and support the design of tourism precision policies.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在探讨激发不同旅游行为的因素，特别关注同日访问和过夜逗留。为了达到这个目的，我们使用了伦巴第地区的移动网络数据。本文强调，旅游住宿的更大可用性以及文化和自然资源是解释过夜逗留的重要因素。相反，临时娱乐和交通设施增加了同日访问的吸引力。结果还显示，各市政府在吸引这两种旅游行为方面存在权衡，同日访问较少的地区有更多的过夜逗留。移动数据提供了空间和时间上的细粒度，可以发现相关模式，并支持旅游精准政策的制定。",

The study finds that the availability of tourism accommodations, cultural and natural resources contribute to overnight stays, while temporary entertainment and transportation facilities enhance attractiveness for same-day visits. Municipalities face a trade-off between attracting both types of tourist behavior, with areas attracting fewer same-day visits having more overnight stays. The use of mobile data allows for the identification of relevant patterns and the development of precision tourism policies."
