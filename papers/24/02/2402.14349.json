    "translated_abstract": "心外脂肪组织(EAT)是一种可以分泌大量脂联素从而影响心肌和冠状动脉的内脏脂肪。EAT的体积和密度可以作为独立风险标记的测量标准，通过非侵入性磁共振图像测量体积是评估EAT的最佳方法。然而，由于EAT与心包积液之间对比度低以及运动伪影的存在，分割EAT是具有挑战性的。本文提出了一种新颖的特征潜空间多级监督网络(SPDNet)，采用基于不确定性驱动和对抗校准学习以增强分割，以更准确地估计EAT体积。网络首先通过在特征潜空间中将不确定性建模为高斯分布来解决由于开放式医疗环境中医学图像的低质量或超出分布范围而导致EAT边缘模糊的问题，通过使用其贝叶斯估计作为正则化",
