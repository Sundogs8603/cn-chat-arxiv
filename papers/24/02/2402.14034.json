However, the complexities in coordinating agents' cooperation and LLMs' erratic performance pose notable challenges in developing robust and efficient multi-agent applications. To tackle these challenges, we propose AgentScope, a developer-centric multi-agent platform with message exchange as its core communication mechanism. Together with abundant syntactic tools, built-in resources, and user-friendly interactions, our communication mechanism significantly reduces the barriers to both development and understanding. Towards robust and flexible multi-agent application, AgentScope provides both built-in and customizable fault tolerance mechanisms while it is also armed with system-level supports for multi-modal data generation, storage and transmission.

    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，多代理应用取得了显著进展。然而，在协调代理合作和LLMs的不稳定性表现方面的复杂性，给开发健壮高效的多代理应用带来了显著挑战。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了AgentScope，一个以消息交换为核心通信机制的面向开发者的多代理平台。我们的通信机制连同丰富的句法工具、内置资源和用户友好的交互，显著降低了开发和理解的障碍。为了实现健壮和灵活的多代理应用，AgentScope提供了内置和可定制的容错机制，同时还配备用于多模态数据生成、存储和传输的系统级支持。此外，我们设计了一个基于actor的分发框架，",
