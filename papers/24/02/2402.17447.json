    "translated_abstract": "食物通过各种努力方式影响着我们的生活，包括口味、营养、健康和可持续性。食谱是通过非结构化文本代代相传的文化胶囊。自动识别命名实体的协议，即食谱文本的基本组成部分，对于各种应用来说都具有巨大价值，从信息提取到新颖食谱生成。命名实体识别是一种从已知标签的非结构化或半结构化数据中提取信息的技术。我们从手动注释的6,611个成分短语的数据开始，累积创建了26,445个短语的增强数据集。同时，我们系统地清理和分析了来自RecipeDB的成分短语，这是黄金标准的食谱数据存储库，并使用Stanford NER进行了标注。基于分析，我们使用基于聚类的方法对88,526个短语的子集进行了取样，同时保留了多样性。",
    "tldr": "该研究基于深度学习，针对食谱文本开发了命名实体识别模型，通过系统的数据处理和分析，构建了用于自动生成新食谱的数据集。",
