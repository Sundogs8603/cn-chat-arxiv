    "translated_abstract": "近年来，人们越来越意识到，当机器学习算法用于自动化决策时，可能会对个人或群体进行不公平待遇，从而产生法律、伦理或经济方面的影响。推荐系统是这些机器学习系统的重要例子，它们帮助用户做出决策。过去大部分关于推荐系统公平性的文献研究都是将用户和物品的公平性问题独立对待，忽视了推荐系统在双边市场中的作用。在本文中，我们提出了CP-FairRank，这是一种基于优化的重新排名算法，在联合目标框架中无缝集成了消费者和生产者两方的公平性约束。该框架具有可泛化性，并可以根据群体分割、推荐模型选择和领域考虑多样的公平性设置，这是其一个重要特点。例如，我们展示了该系统可以同时提高消费者和生产者的满意度，并在实验中取得了良好的结果。",
