This renders the standard practice of keeping a database of malicious URLs ineffective. To this end, we propose a novel on-device pipeline: COPS that intelligently identifies features of fraudulent messages and URLs to alert the user in real-time. COPS is a lightweight pipeline with a detection module based on the Disentangled Variational Autoencoder of size 3.46MB for smishing and URL phishing detection, and we benchmark it on open datasets.

    "translated_abstract": "智能手机已经成为我们日常生活中不可或缺的一部分，几乎可以完成所有事情，从沟通到在线购物。然而，随着使用量的增加，针对移动设备的网络犯罪也在激增。特别是短信诈骗攻击，在近年来观察到显著增长。这个问题进一步加剧了犯罪分子每天创建新的欺骗性网站的情况，这些网站的平均生命周期不到15小时。这使得维护一个恶意URL数据库的标准做法变得无效。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的设备内管道：COPS，它能够智能地识别欺诈性信息和URL的特征，实时警示用户。COPS是一个轻量级管道，其中的检测模块基于大小为3.46MB的解缠结变分自编码器，用于短信诈骗和URL钓鱼检测，并在开放数据集上进行了基准测试。我们分别获得了98.15％和99.5％的准确率，对于这两个任务，误报率和漏报率都很低。",
