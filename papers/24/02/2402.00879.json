We review existing user grouping approaches and highlight their performance limitations in the above problem. We propose formulating user grouping as a graph construction problem where vertices represent users and edge weights indicate the contention and interference. This formulation leverages the graph's max cut to group users and optimizes edge weights to construct the optimal graph whose max cut yields the optimal grouping decisions. To achieve this optimal graph construction, we design an actor-critic graph representation learning (AC-GRL) algorithm.

    "translated_abstract": "在Wi-Fi 802.11ah网络中，受限制的接入窗口（RAW）通过将用户分组和分配周期性时间段来管理竞争和干扰。我们将找到RAW中的最优用户分组决策，以最大化网络的最坏情况用户吞吐量。我们回顾现有的用户分组方法，并强调它们在上述问题中的性能限制。我们提出将用户分组视为图构建问题，其中顶点表示用户，边权重表示竞争和干扰。这种形式利用图的最大切割来分组用户，并优化边权重以构建出最佳图，其最大切割产生最优的分组决策。为了实现这种最优图构建，我们设计了一种演员-评论家图表示学习（AC-GRL）算法。具体来说，演员神经网络（NN）被训练来估计最优图的边权重，使用用户和接入点之间的路径损失。",
