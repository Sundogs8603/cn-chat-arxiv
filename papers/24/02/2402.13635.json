    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.13635v1 公告类型:跨领域 摘要: 机器学习(ML)的采用，更具体地说是深度学习(DL)应用正在蔓延到我们生活的各个主要领域中。在医学领域，发展可信人工智能尤为重要，因为这对患者的生活有着重大影响。虽然可信性涉及多个方面，包括道德、技术和隐私要求，但我们着重于DL中数据质量(训练/测试)的重要性。由于数据质量决定了ML产品的行为，评估数据质量将在医疗人工智能产品的监管批准中起关键作用。我们按照PRISMA指南进行系统性综述，使用PubMed和ACM数字图书馆数据库。我们发现了2362项研究，其中62项符合我们的资格标准。在这一文献中，我们综合现有的关于数据质量框架的知识，并结合ML在医学中的应用视角。因此，我们的工作总结了医疗AI领域数据质量框架的现有知识，并将其与ML应用的视角结合在一起。",
