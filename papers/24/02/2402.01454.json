    "translated_abstract": "在实际的统计因果发现（SCD）中，将领域专家知识作为约束嵌入到算法中被广泛接受，因为这对于创建一致有意义的因果模型是重要的，尽管识别背景知识的挑战被认可。为了克服这些挑战，本文提出了一种新的因果推断方法，即通过将LLM的“统计因果提示（SCP）”与SCD方法和基于知识的因果推断（KBCI）相结合，对SCD进行先验知识增强。实验证明，GPT-4可以使LLM-KBCI的输出与带有LLM-KBCI的先验知识的SCD结果接近真实情况，如果GPT-4经历了SCP，那么SCD的结果还可以进一步改善。而且，即使LLM不含有数据集的信息，LLM仍然可以通过其背景知识来改进SCD。",
