Conversational systems can exploit automatic paraphrasing to make the conversation more natural, e.g., talking about a certain topic using different paraphrases in different time instants. Recently, the task of automatically generating paraphrases has been approached in the context of Natural Language Generation (NLG). While many existing systems simply consist in rule-based models, the recent success of the Deep Neural Networks in several NLG tasks naturally suggests the possibility of exploiting such networks for generating paraphrases.
