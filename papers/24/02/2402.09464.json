    "translated_abstract": "机器学习是一个快速发展的领域，具有广泛的应用，包括生物信号分析，在这个领域中，新颖的算法通常能改善现有技术水平。然而，对算法多样性的鲁棒性，即不同算法是否能一致揭示出相似的发现，很少得到探究。本文研究了在脑电图研究中从已有研究中验证的脑龄预测假设是否适用于不同算法。首先，我们调研了文献，并确定了各种已知对脑龄预测有信息量的特征。我们采用了不同的特征提取技术、处理步骤和模型，并利用了SHAP值的解释能力将我们的发现与现有研究相对齐。我们的模型中很少有几个在我们使用的特定数据集上达到了最先进的性能。此外，分析表明，大多数模型虽然揭示了相似的发现，但也存在差异。",
