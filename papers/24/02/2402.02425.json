    "translated_abstract": "准确预测未来的流体对气象学、海洋学和空气动力学等广泛领域至关重要。然而，由于流体通常从欧拉角度观察，其活跃和复杂的动力学在静止的网格中严重被掩盖和混淆，给预测带来了巨大挑战。本文引入了一种新的拉格朗日引导范式来解决复杂的流体动力学。我们提出了以拉格朗日动力学为导向的欧拉-拉格朗日双重递归网络（EuLagNet），通过跟踪自适应采样的多尺度关键粒子的运动并随时间积累动力学信息来捕捉多尺度流体动力学。具体地，我们提出了一个EuLag块，用于在每个时刻和尺度上传递学习到的欧拉和拉格朗日特征，其中跟踪粒子的运动是从欧拉观察中推断出来的，它们积累的动力学信息被纳入到预测模型中。",
