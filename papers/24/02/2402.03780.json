    "abstract": "This paper investigates the language of propaganda and its stylistic features. It presents the PPN dataset, standing for Propagandist Pseudo-News, a multisource, multilingual, multimodal dataset composed of news articles extracted from websites identified as propaganda sources by expert agencies. A limited sample from this set was randomly mixed with papers from the regular French press, and their URL masked, to conduct an annotation-experiment by humans, using 11 distinct labels. The results show that human annotators were able to reliably discriminate between the two types of press across each of the labels. We propose different NLP techniques to identify the cues used by the annotators, and to compare them with machine classification. They include the analyzer VAGO to measure discourse vagueness and subjectivity, a TF-IDF to serve as a baseline, and four different classifiers: two RoBERTa-based models, CATS using syntax, and one XGBoost combining syntactic and semantic features.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了宣传语言及其文体特征。提出了PPN数据集，即宣传性伪新闻数据集，它是一种多源、多语言、多模态的数据集，由专家机构确定的宣传来源网站上的新闻文章组成。从该数据集中随机选择了一部分样本与来自常规法国新闻的文章混合，并对它们的URL进行了掩盖，以进行人类注释实验，使用11个不同的标签。结果显示，人类注释者能够可靠地区分两种类型的新闻纸对每个标签。我们提出了不同的自然语言处理技术来识别注释者使用的线索，并与机器分类进行比较。其中包括使用VAGO分析器进行辞述模糊和主观性的测量，使用TF-IDF作为基准，以及四种不同的分类器：两个基于RoBERTa模型的模型，使用句法的CATS，以及结合句法和语义特征的一个XGBoost模型。",

The results show that human annotators can reliably discriminate between propaganda news and regular news. The study also compares different NLP techniques and provides findings about stylistic cues."
