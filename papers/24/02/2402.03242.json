    "translated_abstract": "最近的技能匹配方法使用合成训练数据进行分类或相似性模型训练，取得了有希望的结果，减少了耗时且昂贵的注释需求。然而，以前的合成数据集存在限制，例如每个句子只有一个技能并且通常由短句组成。本文介绍了JobSkape，一个解决这些限制的生成合成数据的框架，专门用于增强技能到分类系统的匹配。在这个框架内，我们创建了SkillSkape，一个专门为技能匹配任务量身定制的全面开源合成职位招聘信息数据集。我们介绍了几个离线度量指标，表明我们的数据集类似于真实世界的数据。此外，我们还提出了一个使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行技能提取和匹配任务的多步骤流程，并与已知的监督方法进行了基准测试。我们概述了在真实世界数据上的下游评估结果。",
