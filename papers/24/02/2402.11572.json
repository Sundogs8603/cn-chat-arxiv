In recent years, a proliferation of reference-free methods, leveraging visual-language pre-trained models (VLMs), has emerged. Empirical evidence has substantiated that these innovative approaches exhibit a higher correlation with human judgment, marking a significant advancement in the field. However, does a higher correlation with human evaluations alone sufficiently denote the complete of a metric? In response to this question, in this paper, we study if there are any deficiencies in reference-free metrics. Specifically, inspired by the Cobra Effect, we utilize metric scores as rewards to direct the captioning model toward generating descriptions that closely align with the metric's criteria. If a certain metric has flaws, it will be exploited by the model and reflected in the generated sentences. ",

    "translated_abstract": "评估文本描述和相应图像之间的兼容性代表了多模态研究中的一个核心工作。近年来，利用视觉语言预训练模型（VLMs）的无参考方法大量涌现。实证证据证实，这些创新方法与人类判断的相关性更高，标志着该领域的重大进展。然而，仅高相关性是否足以完全表示度量标准的全面性？为了回答这个问题，在本文中，我们研究了无参考度量标准是否存在任何不足之处。具体来说，受到眼镜蛇效应的启发，我们使用度量得分作为奖励，指导字幕模型生成与度量标准密切一致的描述。如果某个度量标准有缺陷，模型将利用这一点，并体现在生成的句子中。",
