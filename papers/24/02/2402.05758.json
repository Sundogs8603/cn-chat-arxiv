    "translated_abstract": "纵向数据在医疗保健、社会学和地震学等许多领域中具有重要意义，但是真实世界的数据集对从业人员来说存在明显的挑战，因为它们可能是高维的，包含有结构化的缺失模式，并且测量时间点可能受到未知随机过程的控制。尽管已经提出了各种解决方案，但其中大多数仅考虑了这些挑战中的一个。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种灵活高效的潜变量模型，能够应对所有这些限制。我们的方法利用高斯过程来捕获样本与其关联的缺失模式之间的时间相关性，同时也用于建模底层的点过程。我们将我们的模型构建为一个变分自动编码器，同时使用深度神经网络参数化的编码器和解码器模型，并开发了一个可扩展的变分推理方法来进行高效的模型训练。我们展示了这个模型在各个领域的竞争性能。",
