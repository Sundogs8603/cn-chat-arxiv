    "translated_abstract": "最近提出了垂直符号回归（VSR），用于从实验数据中快速发现具有多个独立变量的符号方程。VSR通过构建由涉及一部分独立变量的简化形式方程到完整方程的垂直发现路径来减少搜索空间。深度神经网络已经被许多符号回归器证明是成功的，预计能进一步扩大VSR的规模。然而，直接将VSR与深度神经网络结合将导致梯度传递困难和其他工程问题。我们提出了使用深度策略梯度的垂直符号回归（VSR-DPG），并证明了VSR-DPG可以恢复涉及多个输入变量的真实方程，显著超过基于深度强化学习的方法和先前的VSR变体。我们的VSR-DPG将符号回归建模为一个顺序决策过程，其中方程是通过多次应用来构建的。",
