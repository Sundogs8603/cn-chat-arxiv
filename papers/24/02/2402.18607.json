However, the potential risks associated with such an approach have not been comprehensively examined.   In this paper, we take an adversarial perspective to investigate the potential privacy and fairness risks associated with the sharing of diffusion models.

We demonstrate that the sharer can execut",

    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型近年来在学术界和工业界引起了广泛关注，因为其在采样质量和分布覆盖方面表现出色。因此，提出了跨不同组织分享预训练扩散模型的建议，以提高数据利用率同时通过避免直接分享私人数据来增强隐私保护。然而，与这种方法相关的潜在风险尚未得到全面调查。本文从对抗性的角度探讨了与分享扩散模型相关的潜在隐私和公平风险。具体而言，我们调查了一方（分享者）使用私人数据训练扩散模型并向另一方（接收者）提供预训练模型的黑盒访问权限用于下游任务的情况。我们展示了分享者可以实行的行动",
