    "translated_abstract": "为用户查询生成准确的SQL（文本到SQL）是一个长期存在的问题，因为生成SQL需要理解查询和数据库，然后根据数据库检索准确的数据。现有模型依赖于大型语言模型（LLMs）的综合能力，根据数据库模式生成SQL。然而，有些必要的知识没有明确包含在数据库模式中，或者被LLMs学习了。因此，知识不足的查询生成的SQL可能是不准确的，这会对文本到SQL模型的鲁棒性产生负面影响。为了应对这种情况，我们提出了Knowledge-to-SQL框架，该框架采用定制的数据专家LLM（DELLM）为所有类型的文本到SQL模型提供有用的知识。具体地，我们详细介绍了DELLM的设计，包括表格读取和基本微调过程。",
