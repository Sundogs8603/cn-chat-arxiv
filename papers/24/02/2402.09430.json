    "translated_abstract": "WiFi-based human sensing表现出了在不侵入和无需设备的情况下分析用户行为的显着潜力，使得智能家居和医疗保健等应用受益。然而，大多数先前的工作都集中在单用户感知上，在涉及多用户场景时具有有限的实用性。尽管最近的研究已经开始探讨基于WiFi的多用户活动感知，但仍然缺乏基准数据集以促进可重复和可比较的研究。为了弥补这一空白，我们呈现了WiMANS，据我们所知，这是第一个基于WiFi的多用户活动感知数据集。WiMANS包含超过9.4小时的WiFi信道状态信息（CSI），监测多个用户在各种环境中同时进行的活动。与现有数据集相比，WiMANS不仅收集了双WiFi频段的CSI，还包括了同步视频。我们利用WiMANS来进行基准测试",
