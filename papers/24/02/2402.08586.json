    "title": "Faster Repeated Evasion Attacks in Tree Ensembles",
    "abstract": "Tree ensembles are one of the most widely used model classes. However, these models are susceptible to adversarial examples, i.e., slightly perturbed examples that elicit a misprediction. There has been significant research on designing approaches to construct such examples for tree ensembles. But this is a computationally challenging problem that often must be solved a large number of times (e.g., for all examples in a training set). This is compounded by the fact that current approaches attempt to find such examples from scratch. In contrast, we exploit the fact that multiple similar problems are being solved. Specifically, our approach exploits the insight that adversarial examples for tree ensembles tend to perturb a consistent but relatively small set of features. We show that we can quickly identify this set of features and use this knowledge to speedup constructing adversarial examples.",

    "translated_abstract": "树集成是最广泛使用的模型类之一。然而，这些模型容易受到对抗性样本的攻击，也就是略微扰动的样本会导致错误预测。已经有很多研究致力于设计用于树集成的对抗性样本构建方法。但这是一个计算上具有挑战性的问题，通常需要大量次数的解决（例如对所有训练样本进行解决）。目前的方法试图从头开始寻找这样的样本，这进一步加剧了问题。相反地，我们利用正在解决的多个相似问题的事实。具体而言，我们的方法利用了树集成的对抗性样本倾向于扰动一致但相对较小的一组特征的洞察力。我们展示了我们可以快速识别这组特征，并利用这个知识加速构建对抗性样本。",
