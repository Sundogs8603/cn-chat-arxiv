    "translated_abstract": "最近数据驱动方法（如神经算子）在减少偏微分方程（PDEs）求解时间方面取得了显著进展。然而，这些方法面临的主要挑战之一是需要大量高精度的训练数据，在生成过程中需要显著的计算成本。为了解决这个挑战，我们提出了一种新颖的PDE数据集生成算法，即解空间中的微分算子作用（DiffOAS），它同时加快了数据生成过程并提高了生成数据的精度。具体而言，DiffOAS获取了几个基本的PDE解，并将它们组合以获得解。它对这些解应用微分算子，我们称之为“算子作用”，以高效生成精确的PDE数据点。理论分析表明，DiffOAS方法的时间复杂度比现有的生成方法低一个数量级。",
