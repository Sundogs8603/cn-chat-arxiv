    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的显著指令跟随能力引发了对自动学习合适提示的兴趣。然而，虽然提出了许多有效的方法，但在学习过程中产生的成本（例如访问LLM和评估响应）尚未得到考虑。为克服这个限制，本工作在提示学习中明确引入了有限预算约束。为了开发有原则的解决方案，本研究在提示学习和多臂赌博机的固定预算最佳臂识别（BAI-FB）之间建立了一种新的联系。基于这种联系，提出了一个通用框架TRIPLE（用于提示学习的最佳臂识别），以系统地利用BAI-FB在提示学习中的力量。提示学习的独特特点进一步通过利用聚类和嵌入思想提出了TRIPLE的两个基于嵌入的增强方法。",
