We present an analysis of AI-assisted scholarly writing generated with ScholaCite, a tool we built that is designed for organizing literature and composing Related Work sections for academic papers. Our evaluation method focuses on the analysis of citation graphs to assess the structural complexity and inter-connectedness of citations in texts and involves a three-way comparison between (1) original human-written texts, (2) purely GPT-generated texts, and (3) human-AI collaborative texts. We find that GPT-4 can generate reasonable coarse-grained citation groupings to support human users in brainstorming, but fails to perform detailed synthesis of related works without human intervention. We suggest that future writing assistant tools should not be used to draft text independently of the human author.",

    "translated_abstract": "已经开发出许多AI辅助学术应用程序来帮助研究过程的不同阶段。我们提出了对使用我们构建的工具ScholaCite生成的AI辅助学术写作进行分析。该工具旨在组织文献并撰写学术论文的相关工作部分。我们的评估方法侧重于分析引文图，以评估文本中引文的结构复杂性和互联性，并涉及对（1）原始人类撰写的文本，（2）纯粹由GPT生成的文本以及（3）人工智能与人类合作生成的文本的三方比较。我们发现，GPT-4能够生成合理的粗粒度引文分组，以支持人类用户进行头脑风暴，但在没有人类干预的情况下无法执行相关作品的详细合成。我们建议未来的写作助手工具不应独立于人类作者起草文本。",
