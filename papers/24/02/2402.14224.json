    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.14224v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The mainstream media has much leeway in what it chooses to cover and how it covers it. These choices have real-world consequences on what people know and their subsequent behaviors. However, the lack of objective measures to evaluate editorial choices makes research in this area particularly difficult. In this paper, we argue that there are newsworthy topics where objective measures exist in the form of supporting data and propose a computational framework to analyze editorial choices in this setup. We focus on the economy because the reporting of economic indicators presents us with a relatively easy way to determine both the selection and framing of various publications. Their values provide a ground truth of how the economy is doing relative to how the publications choose to cover it. To do this, we define frame prediction as a set of interdependent tasks. At the article level, we learn to identify the reported stance towards the gene",

    "translated_abstract": "主流媒体在选择何事物进行报道以及如何进行报道方面有很大的自由裁量权。这些选择会对人们所了解的信息和随后的行为产生真实世界的影响。然而，缺乏客观的评估编辑选择的度量使得这一领域的研究特别困难。本文认为在一些有支持数据存在的值得报道的话题中，可以提出一个计算框架来分析编辑选择。我们选择经济作为研究重点，因为经济指标的报道为我们提供了一个相对容易确定各种出版物选择和构架的方式。这些指标为我们提供了一个有关经济表现的真实情况，相对于出版物对其进行报道的方式。为了实现这一目标，我们将框架预测定义为一组相互依赖的任务。",
