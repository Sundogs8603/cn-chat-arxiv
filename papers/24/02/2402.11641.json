For these diverse applications, the vast variety of learning tasks, graph domains, and complex graph learning procedures present challenges for human experts when designing versatile graph learning approaches. Facing these challenges, large language models (LLMs) offer a potential solution due to the extensive knowledge and the human-like intelligence. This paper proposes a novel conceptual prototype for designing versatile graph learning methods with LLMs, with a particular focus on the ``where'' and ``how'' perspectives. From the ``where'' perspective, we summarize four key graph learning procedures, including task definition, graph data feature engineering, model selection and optimization, deployment and serving.
