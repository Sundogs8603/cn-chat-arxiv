    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络被自然对抗样本所利用，这些样本对人类感知没有影响，但会被错误分类。目前的方法通常依赖于深度神经网络的白盒性质来生成这些对抗样本，或者改变对抗样本与训练分布的分布。为了缓解当前方法的局限性，我们提出了EvoSeed，这是一个基于进化策略的搜索算法框架，用于生成自然对抗样本。我们的EvoSeed框架使用辅助扩散和分类器模型在模型无关的黑盒设置中运行。我们使用CMA-ES来优化对对抗种子向量的搜索，该向量在经过条件扩散模型处理后，导致分类器模型错误分类无限制的自然对抗样本。实验证明生成的对抗图像具有高质量，并且可应用于不同的分类器。",
