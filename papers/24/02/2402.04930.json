    "translated_abstract": "现有的大多数扩散模型在训练和采样过程中使用高斯噪声，但这可能无法最优地考虑去噪网络重构的频谱内容。尽管相关噪声在计算机图形学中应用广泛，但其在改进训练过程方面的潜力尚未充分探索。本文介绍了一种新颖且通用的扩散模型类，考虑了图像内部和跨图像的相关噪声。具体而言，我们提出了一种时变噪声模型来将相关噪声纳入训练过程，并提出了一种快速生成相关噪声掩码的方法。我们的模型基于确定性扩散模型，利用蓝噪声相比仅使用高斯白噪声（随机噪声）有助于提高生成质量。此外，我们的框架还允许在单个小批量中引入图像之间的相关性来改善梯度流动。我们进行了定性和定量实验证明了我们模型的有效性。",
