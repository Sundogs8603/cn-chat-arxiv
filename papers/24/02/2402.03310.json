    "abstract": "There is a sensory gulf between the Earth that humans inhabit and the digital realms in which modern AI agents are created. To develop AI agents that can sense, think, and act as flexibly as humans in real-world settings, it is imperative to bridge the realism gap between the digital and physical worlds. How can we embody agents in an environment as rich and diverse as the one we inhabit, without the constraints imposed by real hardware and control? Towards this end, we introduce V-IRL: a platform that enables agents to scalably interact with the real world in a virtual yet realistic environment. Our platform serves as a playground for developing agents that can accomplish various practical tasks and as a vast testbed for measuring progress in capabilities spanning perception, decision-making, and interaction with real-world data across the entire globe.",

    "translated_abstract": "人类生活在地球上，而现代人工智能代理所创造的数字领域之间存在着感官差距。为了开发出在现实世界中能像人类一样灵活感知、思考和行动的人工智能代理，必须弥合数字和物理世界之间的逼真差距。我们如何在一个像我们所居住的世界中一样丰富多样的环境中体现代理，而不受真实硬件和控制所施加的约束？为了实现这个目标，我们引入了V-IRL: 一种平台，可以使代理在虚拟而逼真的环境中与现实世界进行可扩展的互动。我们的平台既是一个开发代理完成各种实际任务的游乐场，又是一个广阔的测试基地，用于衡量在感知、决策和与全球真实数据的互动能力等方面的进展。",
