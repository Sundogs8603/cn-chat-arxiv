    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）展示了许多类似人类的能力，但是LLMs的共情理解和情绪状态尚未与人类对齐。在本研究中，我们探讨了生成型LLM智能体在感知新事件时情绪状态的演变，引入了一种新的架构，通过比较新经验和过去记忆来获得理解新经验的能力。通过这种比较，智能体能够在情境中理解新经验，根据情绪评估理论，这对于情绪生成至关重要。首先，智能体将新经验感知为时间序列文本数据。在感知每个新输入后，智能体生成过去相关记忆的摘要，被称为“规范”，并将新经验与此规范进行比较。通过这种比较，我们可以分析智能体如何在情境中对新经验做出反应。使用情感测试PANAS对智能体进行测试，捕捉智能体在新经验后的情绪状态。",
