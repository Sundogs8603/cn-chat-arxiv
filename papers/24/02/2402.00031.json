There are several approaches in scientific literature to optimize and predict a team's performance. However, most studies employ fine-grained skill statistics of the individual members or constraints such as teams with a set group of members. Currently, no research tackles the highly constrained domain of the FIRST Robotics Competition. This research effort aims to fill this gap by providing an analytical method for optimizing and predicting team performance in a competitive environment while allowing these constraints and only using metrics on previous team performance, not on each individual member's performance. We apply our method to the drafting process of the FIRST Robotics competition, a domain in which the skills change year-over-year, team members change through",
