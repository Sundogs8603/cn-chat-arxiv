Fields et al. (2021) found trojan signatures in computer vision classification tasks with image models, such as, Resnet, WideResnet, Densenet, and VGG. In this paper, we investigate such signatures in the classifier layer parameters of large language models of source code.   Our results suggest that trojan signatures could not generalize to LLMs of code. We found that trojaned code models are stubborn, even when the models were poisoned under more explicit settings (finetuned with pre-trained weights frozen).

    "translated_abstract": "木马签名是由Fields等人(2021)描述的，是被感染类别参数（权重）与未被感染类别参数之间分布的显著差异，可以用于检测被感染的模型。Fields等人(2021)发现了计算机视觉分类任务中的木马签名，比如Resnet、WideResnet、Densenet和VGG。本文研究了源代码大语言模型中分类层参数的这种签名。我们的结果表明，木马签名不能泛化到代码的大语言模型。我们发现，即使在更明确的设置下对模型进行了中毒（用预训练的权重冻结进行微调），被感染的代码模型也仍然固执。我们对两个二进制分类任务进行了九个感染模型的分析：克隆和缺陷检测。据我们所知，这是第一个检查基于权重的木马的工作。",
