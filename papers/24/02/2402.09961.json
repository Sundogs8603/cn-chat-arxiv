    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.09961v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Crowdsourced delivery platforms face complex scheduling challenges to match couriers and customer orders. We consider two types of crowdsourced couriers, namely, committed and occasional couriers, each with different compensation schemes. Crowdsourced delivery platforms usually schedule committed courier shifts based on predicted demand. Therefore, platforms may devise an offline schedule for committed couriers before the planning period. However, due to the unpredictability of demand, there are instances where it becomes necessary to make online adjustments to the offline schedule. In this study, we focus on the problem of dynamically adjusting the offline schedule through shift extensions for committed couriers. This problem is modeled as a sequential decision process. The objective is to maximize platform profit by determining the shift extensions of couriers and the assignments of requests to couriers. To solve the model, a Deep Q-Ne",

    "translated_abstract": "众包配送平台面临着匹配快递员和顾客订单的复杂调度挑战。我们考虑了两种类型的众包快递员，即承诺型和偶发型快递员，每种类型的快递员有不同的补偿方案。众包配送平台通常根据预测的需求为承诺型快递员安排班次。因此，平台可能会在计划周期之前为承诺型快递员制定离线计划。然而，由于需求的不可预测性，有时需要对离线计划进行在线调整。在这个研究中，我们关注通过为承诺型快递员提供班次扩展来动态调整离线计划的问题。这个问题被建模为一个顺序决策过程。目标是通过确定快递员的班次扩展和请求分配给快递员的方式来最大化平台利润。为了解决这个模型，使用了深度Q网络方法。",
