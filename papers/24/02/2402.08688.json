Several techniques to estimate ridership exist nowadays, some of them in an automated manner. Among them, Automatic Passenger Counting (APC) systems detect passengers entering and leaving the vehicle at each station of its course. However, data resulting from these systems are often noisy or even biased, resulting in under or overestimation of onboard occupancy. In this work, we propose a denoising algorithm for APC data to improve their robustness and ease their analyzes.

    "translated_abstract": "准确可靠地了解公共交通网络中的乘客数量对于公共交通运营商和公共部门至关重要，以便了解网络的使用情况并优化运输服务。目前有几种估计乘客数量的技术，其中一些是自动化的。其中，自动乘客计数（APC）系统在车辆每个车站检测乘客的进出。然而，这些系统产生的数据常常是嘈杂的，甚至有偏差，导致乘车人数被低估或高估。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种用于APC数据的降噪算法，以提高其鲁棒性并便于分析。所提出的方法是通过一个约束整数线性优化来实现的，利用票务数据和历史乘车人数数据进一步约束和指导优化过程。通过对性能的评估和与其他降噪方法进行比较，证明了该方法的有效性。",
