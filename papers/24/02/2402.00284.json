    "translated_abstract": "最近出现的基于提示的推荐语言模型（RLM）可以统一解决多个推荐任务。这些RLM充分利用了从丰富的预训练数据中学到的遗传知识，通过提示来解决下游推荐任务，而不需要引入额外的参数或网络训练。然而，手工设计的提示需要显著的专业知识和人力投入，稍微改写提示就可能导致性能的巨大变化。在本文中，我们提出了PAP-REC，一个用于生成个性化自动提示的推荐语言模型的框架，以缓解手动设计提示导致的低效率和低效果问题。具体而言，个性化自动提示允许不同的用户在相同任务中具有不同的提示标记，这些标记是使用梯度下降法自动生成的。个性化自动提示生成推荐语言模型的一个挑战是庞大的搜索空间。",
