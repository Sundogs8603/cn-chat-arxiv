To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, Conan, designed for extracting and analysing intricate character relation graphs from detective narratives. Specifically, we designed hierarchical relationship categories and manually extracted and annotated role-oriented relationships from the perspectives of various characters, incorporating both public relationships known to most characters and secret ones known to only a few. Our experiments with advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama2 reveal their limitations in inferencing complex relationships and handling longer narratives. The combination of the Conan dataset and our pipeline strategy is geared towards understanding the ability of LLMs to comprehend nuanced relational dynamics in narrative contexts.",

    "translated_abstract": "现有的叙事理解数据集往往无法表达现实社会场景中关系的复杂性和不确定性。为了弥补这一空白，我们引入了一个新的基准数据集Conan，旨在从侦探叙事中提取和分析复杂的人物关系图。具体地，我们设计了分层关系类别，并从不同角色的角度手动提取和注释了以角色为导向的关系，包括大多数角色知晓的公开关系和仅少数角色知晓的秘密关系。我们对GPT-3.5、GPT-4和Llama2等先进的大型语言模型进行的实验揭示了它们在推理复杂关系和处理较长叙事方面的局限性。Conan数据集与我们的流程策略的结合旨在了解大型语言模型理解叙事背景中微妙关系动态的能力。",
