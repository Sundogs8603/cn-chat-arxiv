    "abstract": "In recent years, digital twins have been proposed and implemented in various fields with potential applications ranging from prototyping to maintenance. Going forward, they are to enable numerous efficient and sustainable technologies, among them autonomous cars. However, despite a large body of research in many fields, academics have yet to agree on what exactly a digital twin is -- and as a result, what its capabilities and limitations might be. To further our understanding, we explore the capabilities of digital twins concerning diagnosis in the field of transportation. We conduct a systematic mapping study including digital twins of vehicles and their components, as well as transportation infrastructure. We discovered that few papers on digital twins describe any diagnostic process. Furthermore, most existing approaches appear limited to system monitoring or fault detection. These findings suggest that we need more research for diagnostic reasoning utilizing digital twins.",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，数字孪生已被提出并在各个领域中应用，其潜在应用范围从原型制作到维护。未来，数字孪生将推动许多高效可持续的技术应用，其中包括自动驾驶汽车。然而，尽管在许多领域有大量研究，学术界对数字孪生的确切定义以及其能力和局限性尚未达成一致。为了增进我们的理解，我们探讨数字孪生在交通领域诊断中的能力。我们进行了一个系统映射研究，包括车辆和其组件以及交通基础设施的数字孪生。我们发现很少有关数字孪生的论文描述了任何诊断过程。此外，大多数现有方法似乎仅限于系统监测或故障检测。这些发现表明我们需要更多研究来利用数字孪生进行诊断推理。",
