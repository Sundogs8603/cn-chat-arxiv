    "translated_abstract": "最近，图神经网络（GNNs）已经取得了显著的成功。GNNs的主动学习旨在从未标记的数据中查询有价值的样本进行注释，以最大限度地降低成本并提高GNNs的性能。然而，对于GNNs中的强化主动学习，现有的大多数方法可能导致高度不平衡的类分布，尤其是在高度倾斜的类别场景下。这进一步对分类性能产生负面影响。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种新颖的增强类平衡主动学习框架GraphCBAL，用于GNNs。它学习一种最佳策略，以获取类平衡和信息丰富的节点进行注释，从而最大化选择的标记节点训练的GNNs的性能。GraphCBAL设计了类平衡感知状态和奖励函数，实现模型性能和类平衡之间的折衷。我们进一步改进了GraphCBAL，得到GraphCBAL++。",
