We demonstrate the shortcomings of existing models in capturing the nuances necessary for zero-shot performance on item retrieval tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose generate in-domain dataset from ten tasks tailored to unlocking models' representation ability for item retrieval. Our empirical studies demonstrate that fine-tuning embedding models on the dataset leads to remarkable improvements in a variety of retrieval tasks. We also illustrate the practical application of our refined model in a conversational setting, where it enhances the capabilities of LLM-based Recommender Agents like Chat-Rec.
