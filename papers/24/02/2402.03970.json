    "title": "Tabular Data: Is Attention All You Need?",
    "abstract": "Deep Learning has revolutionized the field of AI and led to remarkable achievements in applications involving image and text data. Unfortunately, there is inconclusive evidence on the merits of neural networks for structured tabular data. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale empirical study comparing neural networks against gradient-boosted decision trees on tabular data, but also transformer-based architectures against traditional multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) with residual connections. In contrast to prior work, our empirical findings indicate that neural networks are competitive against decision trees. Furthermore, we assess that transformer-based architectures do not outperform simpler variants of traditional MLP architectures on tabular datasets. As a result, this paper helps the research and practitioner communities make informed choices on deploying neural networks on future tabular data applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度学习彻底改变了人工智能领域，并在涉及图像和文本数据的应用中取得了令人瞩目的成就。遗憾的是，关于神经网络在结构化表格数据上的优势存在着不一致的证据。本文引入了一项大规模实证研究，比较了神经网络和梯度提升决策树在表格数据上的表现，还比较了基于Transformer的架构和传统的多层感知器（MLP）与残差连接的架构。与之前的研究相比，我们的实证发现表明神经网络在决策树方面具有竞争力。此外，我们还评估了基于Transformer的架构在表格数据集上并没有超过传统MLP架构的简化变体。因此，本文帮助研究和实践社区在未来的表格数据应用中做出明智的选择。",
