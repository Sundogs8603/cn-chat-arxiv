    "translated_abstract": "时间知识图（TKG）预测旨在基于给定历史数据预测未来事实。 最近的基于图的模型擅长捕捉TKGs中的结构信息，但缺乏语义理解能力。如今，随着LLMs的激增，基于LLMs的TKG预测模型已经出现。然而，现有的基于LLMs的模型存在三个缺点：（1）它只关注第一阶历史以进行预测，而忽略了高阶历史信息，导致提供给LLMs的信息极为有限。（2）在大量历史信息的情况下，LLMs很难达到最佳推理性能。（3）对于TKG预测，单独使用LLM的时间推理能力有限。为应对前两个挑战，我们提出了历史链（CoH）推理，逐步探索高阶历史，实现LLMs对TKGs上高阶历史信息的有效利用。",
