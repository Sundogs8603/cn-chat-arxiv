Recently, a novel transformative adaptive activation function (TAAF) allowing for any vertical and horizontal translation and scaling was proposed. This work sets the TAAF into the context of other activation functions. It shows that the TAAFs generalize over 50 existing activation functions and utilize similar concepts as over 70 other activation functions, underscoring the versatility of TAAFs.

    "translated_abstract": "神经网络是许多任务的最先进方法，而激活函数是实现这种性能的主要构建模块之一。最近，提出了一种新型的变革性自适应激活函数(TAAF)，它允许任何垂直和水平平移和缩放。本研究将TAAF置于其他激活函数的背景下。研究表明，TAAFs广义地推广了50种现有激活函数，并利用了超过70种其他激活函数的类似概念，突出了TAAFs的多功能性。这项全面的探索将TAAFs定位为神经网络中具有潜力和适应性的重要组成部分。",
