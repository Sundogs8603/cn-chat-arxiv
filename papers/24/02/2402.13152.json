However, due to the lack of annotated resources, only a small fraction of them are currently covered by speech technologies. Albeit self-supervised speech representations, recent massive speech corpora collections, as well as the organization of challenges, have alleviated this inequality, most studies are mainly benchmarked on English. This situation is aggravated when tasks involving both acoustic and visual speech modalities are addressed. In order to promote research on low-resource languages for audio-visual speech technologies, we present AnnoTheia, a semi-automatic annotation toolkit that detects when a person speaks on the scene and the corresponding transcription. In addition, to show the complete process of preparing AnnoTheia for a language of interest, we also describe the adaptation of a pre-trained model for active speaker detection to Spanish, using a database ",

    "translated_abstract": "世界上讲述超过7,000种已知语言，但由于缺乏标注资源，目前只有其中的一小部分被语音技术覆盖。尽管自监督语音表示、最近的大规模语音语料库收集以及挑战活动的组织缓解了这种不平等，但大多数研究主要以英语为基准。当涉及涉及声学和视觉语音模态的任务时，情况变得更加严重。为了促进对视听语音技术中低资源语言的研究，我们提出了AnnoTheia，一种半自动标注工具包，用于检测场景中人员讲话以及相应的转录。此外，为了展示为感兴趣的语言准备AnnoTheia的完整过程，我们还描述了将用于活动发言者检测的预训练模型适应西班牙语的过程，使用了一个数据库。",
