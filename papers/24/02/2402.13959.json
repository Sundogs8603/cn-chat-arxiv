When inflow and churn balance out, the user distribution reaches a steady state. Changing the recommendation algorithm alters the steady state and creates a transition period. During this period, the RS behaves differently from its new steady state. In particular, A/B experiment metrics obtained in transition periods are biased indicators of the RS's long term performance. Scholars and practitioners, however, often conduct A/B tests shortly after introducing new algorithms to validate their effectiveness. This A/B experiment paradigm, widely regarded as the gold standard for assessing RS improvements, may consequently yield false conclusions.

    "translated_abstract": "我研究了一个具有用户流入和流失动态的推荐系统（RS）的概念模型。当流入和流失达到平衡时，用户分布达到稳定状态。改变推荐算法会改变稳定状态并产生过渡期。在这个期间，RS的行为与其新稳态不同。特别是，在过渡期内获得的A/B实验指标是RS长期性能的偏见指标。然而，学者和实践者经常在引入新算法后不久进行A/B测试以验证其有效性。然而，这种被广泛认为是评估RS改进的黄金标准的A/B实验范式可能产生错误结论。我还简要讨论了用户保留动态造成的数据偏见。",
