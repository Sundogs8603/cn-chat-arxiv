Due to the dynamic changes of live content, improving the timeliness of the live streaming recommender system is a critical problem. Intuitively, the timeliness of the data determines the upper bound of the timeliness that models can learn. However, none of the previous works addresses the timeliness problem of the live streaming recommender system from the perspective of data stream design. Employing the conventional fixed window data stream paradigm introduces a trade-off dilemma between labeling accuracy and timeliness. In this paper, we propose a new data stream design paradigm, dubbed Sliver, that addresses the timeliness and accuracy problem of labels by reducing the window size and implementing a sliding window correspondingly.
