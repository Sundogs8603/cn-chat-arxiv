Temporal consistency has been extensively used to mitigate their impact but the existing algorithms in the literature do not explicitly model them.   Here, we apply this by representing the deforming body as a spatio-temporal graph. We then introduce a refinement network that performs graph convolutions over this graph to output 3D poses. To ensure robustness to occlusions, we train this network with a set of binary masks that we use to disable some of the edges as in drop-out techniques.   In effect, we simulate the fact that some joints can be hidden for periods of time and train the network to be immune to that. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach compared to state-of-the-art techniques that infer poses from single-camera sequences.",

    "translated_abstract": "遮挡仍然是单摄像头视频序列中3D人体姿势估计的关键挑战之一。虽然时间一致性已被广泛用于减轻其影响，但文献中的现有算法并没有明确对其进行建模。在这里，我们通过将变形的身体表示为时空图来应用这一点。然后，我们引入一个精炼网络，该网络对该图执行图卷积以输出3D姿势。为了确保对遮挡具有鲁棒性，我们使用一组二进制掩码来训练这个网络，我们将其用于禁用一些边，如去除技术中。实际上，我们模拟了一些关节可能在一段时间内被隐藏的事实，并训练网络免疫于此。我们展示了与从单摄像头序列推断姿势的最先进技术相比，这种方法的有效性。",
