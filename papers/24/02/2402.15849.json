    "translated_abstract": "最大可提取价值（MEV）已经成为区块链系统设计领域的一个新前沿。去中心化和金融的结合赋予了区块生产者（即矿工）不仅选择和添加交易到区块链的权力，更重要的是，还可以对其进行排序，以尽可能多地从中获利。虽然这种价格对于区块生产者提供的服务来说可能是不可避免的，但链上用户从长远来看可能更愿意使用不那么掠夺性的系统。本文提出将MEV提取率纳入协议设计空间中。我们的目标是利用此参数来维持矿工（需要得到补偿）和用户（需要感到被鼓励进行交易）之间的健康平衡。受EIP-1559引入的交易费原则的启发，我们设计了一个动态机制，旨在通过更新MEV提取率来达到稳定目标。",
