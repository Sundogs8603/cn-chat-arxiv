    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)在各个领域得到了广泛应用，通过其非凡的推理和理解能力改变了人类生活。随着它们在敏感任务中的增加使用，安全问题引起了广泛关注。人们已经做出了大量努力，以确保LLMs与人类道德原则相一致，以确保其安全部署。尽管有潜力，但最近的研究表明，对齐的LLMs容易受到专门的越狱提示的影响，这些提示绕过安全措施，引发暴力和有害内容。当代LLMs的离散本质和庞大规模使得自动生成多样化、高效和强效的越狱提示面临重大挑战，这是一个持续的障碍。在本文中，我们介绍了一种名为RIPPLE（基于潜意识利用和模仿动作的快速优化）的新型基于优化的方法，该方法受到了两个心理学概念的启发：潜意识和模仿动作。",
