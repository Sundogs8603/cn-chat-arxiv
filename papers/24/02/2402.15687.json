    "translated_abstract": "现有的医学图像配准算法要么依赖于特定数据集的训练，要么依赖于局部纹理特征来对齐图像。前者在没有大型专门训练数据集的情况下无法可靠地实施，而后者缺乏全局语义，因此容易陷入局部最小值。在本文中，我们提出了一种无需训练的可变形图像配准方法 DINO-Reg，利用通用图像编码器 DINOv2 进行图像特征提取。DINOv2 编码器是使用包含自然图像的 ImageNet 数据进行训练的。我们使用了预训练的 DINOv2 而没有进行任何微调。我们的方法将 DINOv2 编码特征输入到离散优化器中，以找到最优的可变形配准场。我们进行了一系列实验，以了解这种通用图像编码器在图像配准应用中的行为和作用。结合手工特征，我们的方法取得了胜利。",
