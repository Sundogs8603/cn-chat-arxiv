Entrepreneurs from lean economies in particular are well positioned to outsource tasks to generative AI given limited resources. In this paper, we work to address a growing disparity in use of these technologies by building on a four-year partnership with a local entrepreneurial hub dedicated to equity in tech and entrepreneurship. Together, we co-designed an interactive workshops series aimed to onboard local entrepreneurs to generative AI platforms. Alongside four community-driven and iterative workshops with entrepreneurs across five months, we conducted interviews with 15 local entrepreneurs and community providers.

    "translated_abstract": "生成 AI 平台和功能正在渗透工作的许多方面。特别是来自实力薄弱的经济体的企业家由于资源有限，因此很有可能将任务外包给生成 AI。在本文中，我们通过与当地创业中心开展长达四年的合作，致力于解决对这些技术使用的不平等现象。我们共同设计了一系列互动研讨会，旨在帮助当地企业家熟悉生成 AI 平台。除此之外，我们还与15位当地企业家和社区提供者进行了访谈。我们详细介绍了对当地企业家进行团体和支持性曝光的重要性，为他们提供生成 AI 工具的可操作使用（以及对不使用的支持），通过强调创业力量来揭开生成 AI 技术的神秘面纱。",
