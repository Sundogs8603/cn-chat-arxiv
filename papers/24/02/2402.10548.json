    "translated_abstract": "传统搜索引擎通常为所有用户提供相同的搜索结果，忽视了个体偏好。为了解决这一局限性，发展了个性化搜索，根据查询日志中获取的用户偏好重新排序结果。基于深度学习的个性化搜索方法显示出潜力，但它们严重依赖丰富的训练数据，使其容易受到数据稀疏挑战的影响。本文提出了一种认知个性化搜索（CoPS）模型，该模型将大型语言模型（LLMs）与启发自人类认知的认知记忆机制相结合。CoPS利用LLMs来增强用户建模和用户搜索体验。认知记忆机制包括感觉记忆以快速做出感性反应，工作记忆以进行复杂的认知反应，长期记忆以存储历史互动。CoPS使用三步方法处理新查询：识别重新查找行为",
