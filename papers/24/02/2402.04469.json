    "abstract": "As IoT networks become more complex and generate massive amounts of dynamic data, it is difficult to monitor and detect anomalies using traditional statistical methods and machine learning methods. Deep learning algorithms can process and learn from large amounts of data and can also be trained using unsupervised learning techniques, meaning they don't require labelled data to detect anomalies. This makes it possible to detect new and unknown anomalies that may not have been detected before. Also, deep learning algorithms can be automated and highly scalable; thereby, they can run continuously in the backend and make it achievable to monitor large IoT networks instantly. In this work, we conduct a literature review on the most recent works using deep learning techniques and implement a model using ensemble techniques on the KDD Cup 99 dataset. The experimental results showcase the impressive performance of our deep anomaly detection model, achieving an accuracy of over 98\\%.",
