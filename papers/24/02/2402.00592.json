    "translated_abstract": "在现实世界的应用中，人们经常遇到标记模糊的数据，即不同的标注者为相同样本分配了冲突的类别标签。部分标签学习允许在这种弱监督的情况下训练分类器。虽然最先进的方法已经具有良好的预测性能，但它们往往受到错误的不确定性估计的影响。然而，在医学和自动驾驶等安全关键领域，具有良好校准的不确定性估计尤为重要。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于最近邻的部分标签学习算法，该算法利用了Dempster-Shafer理论。对人工数据集和实际数据集进行的广泛实验表明，所提出的方法能够提供良好的不确定性估计，并具有竞争力的预测性能。此外，我们还证明了我们的算法具有风险一致性。",
