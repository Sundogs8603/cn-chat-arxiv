    "translated_abstract": "互联网上存在大量文本和视频数据，通过下一个令牌或帧预测支持大规模自监督学习。然而，它们并没有被充分利用：语言模型在现实世界中产生了显著影响，而视频生成在很大程度上仅限于媒体娱乐。然而，视频数据捕捉了关于物理世界的重要信息，这些信息很难用语言表达。为了弥补这一差距，我们讨论了将视频生成扩展到解决真实世界任务的一个被低估的机会。我们观察到，类似于语言，视频可以作为一个统一的接口，可以吸收互联网知识并表示多样化的任务。此外，我们展示了如何通过各种技术（如上下文学习、规划和强化学习）将视频生成用作规划者、代理、计算引擎和环境模拟器。我们确定了一些重要的创新",
