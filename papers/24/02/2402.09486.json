    "translated_abstract": "多目标优化在许多应用中很常见，其中构建 Pareto 前沿（PF）以显示各种偏好下的最优解。以往的方法通常利用 Pareto 目标集（PF 上的粒子）来表示整个 PF。然而，很少有研究探讨 PF 上 Pareto 目标的经验分布，这隐含地限制了先前方法中多样性和代表性 Pareto 目标的生成。为了弥补这个差距，我们在本文中提出构建 PF 上“均匀分布”的 Pareto 目标，以减轻先前多目标优化方法中的有限多样性问题。我们是第一个正式定义多目标优化问题中“均匀性”的研究者。我们使用神经网络优化 Pareto 前沿上的最大最小距离，得到渐近和非渐近均匀 Pareto 目标。我们提出的方法得到了验证。",
