However, in the case of less common queries, the associated behavioral data tends to be sparse and noisy, offering inadequate support to the search mechanism. To address this challenge, the concept of query reformulation has been introduced. It suggests that less common queries could utilize the behavior patterns of their popular counterparts with similar meanings. In Amazon product search, query reformulation has displayed its effectiveness in improving search relevance and bolstering overall revenue.

    "translated_abstract": "顾客行为数据在电子商务搜索系统中起着重要作用。然而，在少见查询的情况下，关联的行为数据往往稀疏且嘈杂，无法为搜索机制提供足够的支持。为解决这一挑战，引入了查询重构的概念。它建议少见查询可以利用具有类似含义的热门对应查询的行为模式。在亚马逊产品搜索中，查询重构已显示出在提高搜索相关性和增强整体收入方面的有效性。然而，将这种方法调整为适用于流量较低且复杂的多语言环境下运营的较小或新兴企业在可扩展性和可扩展性方面存在挑战。本研究旨在通过构建一个查询重构方案来克服这一挑战，即使面对有限的交易量也能有效运行。",
