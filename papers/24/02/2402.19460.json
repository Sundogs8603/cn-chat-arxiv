The latest goal is disentanglement: the construction of multiple estimators that are each tailored to one and only one task. Hence, there is a plethora of recent advances with different intentions - that often entirely deviate from practical behavior. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of numerous uncertainty estimators across diverse tasks on ImageNet. We find that, despite promising theoretical endeavors, disentanglement is not yet achieved in practice. Additionally, we reveal which uncertainty estimators excel at which specific tasks, providing insights for practitioners and guiding future research toward task-centric and disentangled uncertainty estimation methods.

    "translated_abstract": "不确定性量化，曾经是一个独立的任务，已经发展成为一个包含预测抑制、越界检测以及随机不确定性量化在内的任务谱系。最新的目标是解开不确定性：构建多个估计器，每个都专门定制于一个特定任务。因此，最近有大量不同意图的最新进展——这些往往完全偏离实际行为。本文在ImageNet上对多种不确定性估计器进行全面评估。我们发现，尽管有着颇有希望的理论努力，实践中仍未实现解开。此外，我们揭示了哪些不确定性估计器在哪些特定任务上表现出色，为从业者提供见解并引导未来研究朝着基于任务和解开的不确定性估计方法发展。我们的代码可在 https://github.com/bmucsanyi/bud 找到。",
