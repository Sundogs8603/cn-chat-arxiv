    "translated_abstract": "流体数据的完成是一个具有潜在益处的研究问题，对实验和计算流体动力学都有高潜力。有效的流体数据完成方法可以减少流体动力学实验中所需的传感器数量，并允许在计算流体动力学（CFD）模拟中使用更粗糙和更自适应的网格。然而，流体数据完成问题的逆问题性质使得从理论上获得解决方案非常困难，并对数据驱动方法（例如神经网络模型）产生高数值不确定性和不稳定性。为了解决这些挑战，我们借鉴了计算机视觉领域的最新进展，利用向量量化技术通过两阶段学习过程将完整和不完整的流体数据空间映射到离散值较低维度的表示。我们在 Kolmogorov 流数据（雷诺数：100）上展示了我们方法的有效性。",
