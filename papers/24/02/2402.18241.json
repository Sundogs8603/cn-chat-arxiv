Detection of affective states is of utmost importance for mental health monitoring, smart entertainment selection and dynamic workload management. In this paper, we discussed relevant literature on affective state detection using physiology data, the benefits and limitations of different sensors and methods used for collecting physiology data, and our rationale for selecting functional near-infrared spectroscopy. We present the design of an experiment involving nine subjects to evoke the affective states of meditation, amusement and cognitive load and the results of the attempt to classify using machine learning.

    "translated_abstract": "感情状态调节我们日常功能，并对心理和身体健康产生巨大影响。检测情感状态对于心理健康监测、智能娱乐选择和动态工作负荷管理至关重要。本文讨论了使用生理数据检测情感状态的相关文献，不同传感器和方法收集生理数据的优缺点，以及我们选择功能性近红外光谱的理由。我们设计了一个涉及九名受试者引起冥想、娱乐和认知负荷情感状态的实验，并尝试使用机器学习进行分类，分别达到了83.04%的三类分类的平均准确率；组模型实现了84.39%的准确率；独立主题模型使用留存法模型达到了60.57%的准确率。",
