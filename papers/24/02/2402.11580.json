We apply a unified singular control framework where irreversible reinsurance contracts can be signed in both discrete and continuous times. The results theoretically illustrate that, rather than continuous-time contracts or a bunch of discrete-time contracts, a single once-for-all reinsurance contract is preferred. Moreover, the Stackelberg game turns out to be centering on the signing time of the single contract. The insurer signs the contract if the premium rate is lower than a time-dependent threshold and the reinsurer designs a premium that triggers the signing of the contract at his preferred time.

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种再保险Stackelberg博弈，在该博弈中，保险公司和再保险公司在决策中采用均值-方差准则（缩写为MV），并且再保险是不可逆的。我们应用了一个统一的奇点控制框架，其中不可逆的再保险合同既可以在离散时间也可以在连续时间签订。理论上的结果表明，相较于连续时间合同或一堆离散时间合同，单个一次性再保险合同更为理想。此外，Stackelberg博弈的焦点在于单一合同的签订时间。如果保费率低于一个与时间有关的阈值，保险公司就会签订合同；再保险公司则设计一个保费，以在他首选的时间触发合同签订。此外，我们发现再保险偏好、贴现和回归在再保险公司决策中的影响在降低。",
    "tldr": "该研究发现在再保险Stackelberg博弈中，一次性再保险合同的签订时间是关键，保险公司会在保费率低于时间阈值时签订合同，再保险公司的决策受再保险偏好、贴现和回归的影响。"
