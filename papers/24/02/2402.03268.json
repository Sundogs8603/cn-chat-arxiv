    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (LMs) are able to perform complex reasoning without explicit fine-tuning. To understand how pre-training with a next-token prediction objective contributes to the emergence of such reasoning capability, we propose that we can view an LM as deriving new conclusions by aggregating indirect reasoning paths seen at pre-training time. We found this perspective effective in two important cases of reasoning: logic reasoning with knowledge graphs (KGs) and math reasoning with math word problems (MWPs). More specifically, we formalize the reasoning paths as random walk paths on the knowledge/reasoning graphs. Analyses of learned LM distributions suggest that a weighted sum of relevant random walk path probabilities is a reasonable way to explain how LMs reason. Experiments and analysis on multiple KG and MWP datasets reveal the effect of training on random walk paths and suggest that augmenting unlabeled random walk reasoning paths can improve real-world multi-step r",

    "translated_abstract": "预训练的语言模型能够在没有明确微调的情况下执行复杂的推理。为了理解预训练与下一个标记预测目标的关系如何促使推理能力的出现，我们提出可以将语言模型视为在预训练时通过聚合间接的推理路径来得出新结论。我们发现，这个视角在逻辑推理和数学推理等关键情况下非常有效。具体而言，我们将推理路径形式化为在知识/推理图上的随机游走路径。对学习的语言模型分布的分析表明，相关随机游走路径概率的加权和是解释语言模型推理的合理方式。对多个知识图谱和数学问题数据集进行的实验和分析揭示了训练对随机游走路径的影响，并表明增加无标签的随机游走推理路径可以提高现实世界的多步推理能力。",
