    "translated_abstract": "稀疏基础恢复是一个经典且重要的统计学习问题，当模型维度$p$远大于样本数$n$时，尤其重要。然而，在联邦学习（FL）框架中研究稀疏基础恢复的工作很少，其中必须同时保护客户数据的差分隐私（DP）。特别是，现有的DP-FL算法（如DP-SGD）的性能保证在$p \\gg n$时会显著下降，因此它们将无法准确学习真实的底层稀疏模型。在本工作中，我们开发了一种新的差分私密稀疏基础恢复算法用于FL设置，称为SPriFed-OMP。SPriFed-OMP将OMP（Orthogonal Matching Pursuit）转化为FL设置。此外，它将SMPC（Secure Multi-Party Computation）和DP结合起来，以确保只需添加少量的噪声即可实现差分隐私。",
