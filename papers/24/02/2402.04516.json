    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了支持在图度量空间上的测度的最优传输（OT）问题。最近，Le 等人（2022）利用图结构提出了一种 OT 的变体，称为 Sobolev 传输（ST），它提供了一种闭式表达式用于快速计算。然而，ST 的定义中实质上与 $L^p$ 几何结构耦合在一起，这使得在其他先验结构中利用 ST 变得非常困难。相反，经典的 OT 通过修改底层成本函数具有适应各种几何结构的灵活性。一个重要的例子是超力 Wassestein（OW），它通过利用\\emph{Orlicz 几何结构}超越了 $L^p$ 结构。与使用标准 $p$-阶 Wassestein 相比，OW 显著提高了某些机器学习方法的性能。然而，由于其两层优化 formulation，OW 在其计算上带来了新的挑战。在这项工作中，我们利用了一类特定的凸函数。",
