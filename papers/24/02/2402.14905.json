    "translated_abstract": "本文解决了移动设备上高效的大型语言模型(LLMs)的迫切需求问题，这是由于云成本和延迟问题不断增加所导致的。我们专注于设计具有不到十亿参数的顶级LLMs，这是移动部署的实际选择。与普遍的观点相反，强调数据和参数数量在确定模型质量方面的关键作用，我们的研究强调了亚十亿规模LLMs的模型架构的重要性。利用深度和瘦身结构，再加上嵌入共享和分组查询注意机制，我们建立了一个强大的基准网络，称为MobileLLM，其在将近125M/350M先进模型上分别获得了惊人的2.7%/4.3%的准确率提升。此外，我们提出了一种立即的块状权重共享方法，不增加模型大小，且仅具有极小的延迟开销。由此产生的模型被命名为MobileLLM-L",
