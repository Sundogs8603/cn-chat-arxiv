    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.17392v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Nowadays, technology is rapidly advancing: bots are writing comments, articles, and reviews. Due to this fact, it is crucial to know if the text was written by a human or by a bot. This paper focuses on comparing structures of the coarse-grained partitions of semantic paths for human-written and bot-generated texts. We compare the clusterizations of datasets of n-grams from literary texts and texts generated by several bots. The hypothesis is that the structures and clusterizations are different. Our research supports the hypothesis. As the semantic structure may be different for different languages, we investigate Russian, English, German, and Vietnamese languages.",

    "translated_abstract": "现在，技术正在迅速发展：机器人正在撰写评论、文章和评论。因此，重要的是要知道文本是由人类编写还是由机器人编写。本文旨在比较人类编写和机器人生成文本的语义路径粗粒度划分的结构。我们比较了文学文本和几个机器人生成文本的n-gram数据集的聚类情况。假设是这些结构和聚类是不同的。我们的研究支持了这一假设。由于不同语言的语义结构可能不同，因此我们调查了俄语、英语、德语和越南语。",
