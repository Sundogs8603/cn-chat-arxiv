    "translated_abstract": "随机用户均衡（SUE）模型描述了交通分配问题中的感知差异。根据无界感知行车时间分布的假设，传统SUE问题导致所有可用路径的积极选择概率，无论它们的行车时间如何不吸引人。本研究提出了一个eUnit-SUE模型来放宽这一假设。eUnit模型源自一个有界概率分布，该闭合形式模型与具有指数化均匀分布随机误差的指数化随机效用最大化（ERUM）范式一致，其中下限和上限端元地确定了路径使用情况。具体而言，为eUnit-SUE问题提出了Beckmann类型的数学规划制定。严格证明了等价性和唯一性属性。数值实例表明，eUnit的边界介于下限和上限之间。",
