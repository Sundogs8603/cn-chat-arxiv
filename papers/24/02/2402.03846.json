    "abstract": "Outlier generation is a popular technique used for solving important outlier detection tasks. Generating outliers with realistic behavior is challenging. Popular existing methods tend to disregard the 'multiple views' property of outliers in high-dimensional spaces. The only existing method accounting for this property falls short in efficiency and effectiveness. We propose BISECT, a new outlier generation method that creates realistic outliers mimicking said property. To do so, BISECT employs a novel proposition introduced in this article stating how to efficiently generate said realistic outliers. Our method has better guarantees and complexity than the current methodology for recreating 'multiple views'. We use the synthetic outliers generated by BISECT to effectively enhance outlier detection in diverse datasets, for multiple use cases. For instance, oversampling with BISECT reduced the error by up to 3 times when compared with the baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "异常点生成是解决重要异常检测任务的常用技术。生成具有真实行为的异常点具有挑战性。现有的流行方法往往忽视高维空间中异常点的“多视图”属性。唯一考虑到此属性的现有方法在效率和效果上存在不足。我们提出了一种名为BISECT的新的异常点生成方法，该方法可以创建具有真实行为且模仿该属性的异常点。为了实现这一点，BISECT采用了本文介绍的一种新颖的命题，说明如何高效地生成这些真实异常点。与当前重新创建“多视图”的方法相比，我们的方法具有更好的保证和复杂性。我们使用BISECT生成的合成异常点有效地增强了各种数据集的异常检测，适用于多种用例。例如，与基线相比，使用BISECT进行过采样将错误率降低了最多3倍。",
