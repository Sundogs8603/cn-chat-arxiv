    "translated_abstract": "空气污染是一个全球性的重要问题，不仅影响人类健康，还影响环境。有关污染物浓度的时空数据的存在对于进行空气污染研究和监测排放至关重要。然而，尽管观测数据具有较大的时间覆盖范围，但测站的数量非常有限，通常建在人口密集地区。本研究的主要目标是创建能够推断无观测数据地点的污染物浓度的模型。采用机器学习模型，更具体地说是随机森林模型，对2019年伊比利亚半岛上的五种选择性污染物（$NO_2$，$O_3$，$SO_2$，$PM10$和$PM2.5$）的浓度进行预测。模型特征包括卫星测量数据、气象变量、土地利用分类、时间变量（月份、年中日期）和空间变量（纬度、经度、海拔）。",
