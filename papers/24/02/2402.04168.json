    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning is a highly active research field with promising advancements. In the field of autonomous driving, however, often very simple scenarios are being examined. Common approaches use non-interpretable control commands as the action space and unstructured reward designs which lack structure. In this work, we introduce Informed Reinforcement Learning, where a structured rulebook is integrated as a knowledge source. We learn trajectories and asses them with a situation-aware reward design, leading to a dynamic reward which allows the agent to learn situations which require controlled traffic rule exceptions. Our method is applicable to arbitrary RL models. We successfully demonstrate high completion rates of complex scenarios with recent model-based agents.",

    "translated_abstract": "增强学习是一个非常活跃的研究领域，具有很多有前景的进展。然而，在自动驾驶领域，通常只研究非常简单的场景。常见的方法使用非可解释的控制命令作为动作空间，以及缺乏结构的奖励设计。在本文中，我们引入了基于信息的增强学习，将结构化的规则手册作为知识源集成进来。我们学习轨迹，并使用情境感知的奖励设计来评估它们，从而产生动态奖励，使代理能够学习需要控制交通规则例外的情况。我们的方法适用于任意增强学习模型。我们成功地展示了最近的基于模型的代理在复杂场景中的高完成率。",
