    "translated_abstract": "随着新兴主题的兴起，自主代理的研究兴趣正在增加。大型语言模型的显著成就已经展示了在自主代理中达到人类智能的巨大潜力。然而，挑战在于使这些代理能够在动态环境中学习、推理和导航不确定性。当处理动态情况时，上下文意识成为强化多agent系统的关键因素。尽管现有的研究专注于上下文感知系统和多agent系统，但缺乏全面概述如何将上下文感知系统与多agent系统集成的综合调查。为了填补这个空白，本调查提供了对最先进的上下文感知多agent系统的全面概述。首先，我们概述了促进这些系统之间集成的上下文感知系统和多 agent 系统的特性。随后，我们提出了一个通用的过程来建模上下文感知和多agent系统的集成。",
