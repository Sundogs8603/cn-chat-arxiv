    "translated_abstract": "需要基于测量数据对时间序列进行预测，在广泛的应用中是必需的，并且已经成为广泛研究的课题。其中一个特别具有挑战性的任务是对混沌动力学生成的时间序列进行预测。近年来，储层计算已被证明是一种有效的方法，可以从数据中预测混沌动力学并重建混沌吸引子。在这项工作中，我们朝着更小、更低复杂度的水库迈出了步伐，目标是提高硬件实现性能，并更可靠地生产出足够满意的替代模型。我们表明，一个非耦合节点的水库比复杂水库拓扑更可靠地产生长期时间序列预测。然后，我们将非耦合水库改进的吸引子重建与所得替代系统的较小谱半径联系起来。这些结果表明，节点度在确定水库的长期时间序列预测性能方面起着重要作用。",
