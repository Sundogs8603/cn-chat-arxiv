    "translated_abstract": "在这篇文章中，我们展示了完成问题(即决策问题，即部分结构能否完成为完整结构)在许多组合结构中是NP完全的。虽然大多数文献中的归约都是手工完成的，但我们提出了一种完全自动构建归约的算法。使用基于SAT的框架，我们对具有禁止子结构的符号映射的完成问题进行了首次深入研究，并分类了数千个NP完全的结构。我们的列表包括了由Knuth引入的用于平面点配置公理化的内部三元组系统。最后但并非最不重要的是，我们提供了一个将内部三元组系统推广到更高维度的无限家族的结构，对于这些结构，完成问题是NP完全的。",

By thoroughly studying the completion problem on sign mappings and classifying thousands of NP-complete structures, as well as introducing a family of structures that generalize the interior triple system to higher dimensions, we contribute to the understanding of this problem."
