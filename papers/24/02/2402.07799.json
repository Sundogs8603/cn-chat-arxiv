    "translated_abstract": "在环境设计中，一个感兴趣的方与另一个代理通过对环境进行改变来影响其决策。大部分关于规划环境重新设计的研究假设感兴趣的方的目标是促进目标和计划的识别，并在环境修改空间中搜索以找到简化这些任务并优化特定度量标准的最小一组变化。这个搜索空间通常难以处理，因此现有方法设计了度量相关的修剪技术以更高效地进行搜索。这导致方法无法在不同的目标和/或指标上进行泛化。在本文中，我们认为感兴趣的方的目标和指标不一定与识别代理的目标或计划相关。因此，为了广义化规划环境重新设计的任务，我们开发了一种通用的环境重新设计方法，该方法不受度量影响，并利用了最新的顶层研究成果。",
