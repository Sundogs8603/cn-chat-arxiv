    "translated_abstract": "20世纪50年代初引入了随机逼近（SA），并在几十年来一直是一个活跃的研究领域。虽然最初关注的是统计问题，但人们发现它可以应用于信号处理、凸优化。在过去的十年里，研究者对SA重新产生了兴趣，后来发现SA在强化学习（RL）中也有应用，并引发了人们的兴趣复苏。尽管大部分文献是针对从有限维欧几里得空间观测的SA情况，但人们对将其扩展到无限维度也很感兴趣。扩展到希尔伯特空间相对较容易，但当我们涉及到Banach空间时情况并非如此 - 因为在Banach空间的情况下，即使在一般情况下也不存在“大数定律”。我们考虑了一些逼近在Banach空间中有效的情况。我们的框架包括当Banach空间B是C时的情况",
