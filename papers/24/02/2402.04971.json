    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑到具有信息优势的多个发信者向单个自私行为者传递信号以使其采取某些行动。这些设置是计算经济学，多智能体学习和具有多个目标的机器学习中普遍存在的。核心解决方案概念是发信者信号策略的纳什均衡。理论上，我们证明一般情况下找到一个均衡是PPAD-Hard的;实际上，计算一个发信者的最佳响应甚至是NP-Hard的。鉴于这些固有的困难，我们转而寻找局部纳什均衡。我们提出了一种新颖的可微神经网络来近似该游戏的非线性和不连续效用。结合额外梯度算法，我们发现了超越完全展示均衡和现有神经网络发现的局部均衡。广义上，我们的理论和实证贡献对广泛的类别感兴趣。",
