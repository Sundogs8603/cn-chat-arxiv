Are there any deficiencies of its translations and what improvements could be made? In this report, we focus on LevT's decoder and analyse the decoding results length, subword generation, and deletion module's capability. We hope to identify weaknesses of the decoder for future improvements.   We also compare translations of the original LevT, knowledge-distilled LevT, LevT with translation memory, and the KD-LevT with translation memory to see how KD and translation memory can help.",
