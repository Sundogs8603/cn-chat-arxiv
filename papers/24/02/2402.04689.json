    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们介绍了一种新的基于流的方法，用于Lipschitz函数的全局优化，称为Stein Boltzmann抽样（SBS）。我们的方法从Boltzmann分布中采样，该分布在优化函数的最小值集合上渐近均匀。候选解通过Stein Variational Gradient Descent算法进行采样。我们证明了我们方法的渐近收敛性，引入了两种SBS变体，并在各种基准函数上与几种最先进的全局优化算法进行了详细比较。我们方法的设计、理论结果和实验表明，SBS特别适合作为高效全局优化方法的延续，因为它可以在很好地利用预算的同时产生更好的解决方案。",
