    "translated_abstract": "近年来，自监督学习已经成为一种强大的工具，用于利用丰富的未标记数据进行表示学习，并已广泛应用于各个领域。然而，当应用于分子表示学习（MRL）时，流行的技术(如掩码亚单位重建)往往表现不佳，这是因为分子中可能的原子组合方式自由度较高，给掩码重建范式带来了难以逾越的复杂性。为了应对这一挑战，我们引入了REMO，这是一个自监督学习框架，利用常见化学中的明确定义的原子组合规则。具体来说，REMO在文献中已知的170万个化学反应上进行了图/变换器编码器的预训练。我们提出了两个预训练目标: 掩码反应中心重建（MRCR）和反应中心识别（RCI）。REMO通过利用新颖的解决方案在MRL方面做出了贡献。",
