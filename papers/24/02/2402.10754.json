This paper introduces LLMDFA, an LLM-powered dataflow analysis framework that analyzes arbitrary code snippets without requiring a compilation infrastructure and automatically synthesizes downstream applications. Inspired by summary-based dataflow analysis, LLMDFA decomposes the problem into three sub-problems, which are effectively resolved by several essential strategies, including few-shot chain-of-thought prompting and tool synthesis.
