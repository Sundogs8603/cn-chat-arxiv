    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个基于蒙特卡洛的人工神经网络框架，用于对百慕大期权进行定价，具有几个显著优势。这些优势包括目标百慕大期权的高效静态套期保值以及用于风险管理的敞口配置的有效生成。我们还介绍了一种新颖的优化算法，旨在加速Lokeshwar等人（2022年）提出的神经网络框架的收敛，同时支持全面的错误收敛分析。我们对马尔可夫和无套利假设下的现值（PV）分布进行了广泛的比较分析。我们将本文提出的神经网络模型与Longstaff和Schwartz（2001年）最初引入的方法结合起来，并在所有百慕大行权时点上将其与由Fang和Oosterlee（2009年）首创的COS模型进行了基准对比。此外，我们评估了敞口配置",
