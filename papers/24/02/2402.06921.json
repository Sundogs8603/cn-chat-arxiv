    "translated_abstract": "本研究针对四种聚类技术进行性能比较，旨在实现强大的混合模型用于监督学习任务。我们采集了来自位于西班牙加利西亚省Lugo Xermade地区的生物气候住宅“Sotavento”上实验性风电场的真实数据集。作者选择了热太阳能发电系统作为研究对象，研究了应用多种聚类方法后再应用回归技术预测系统输出温度的工作原理。为了定义每种聚类方法的质量，我们实施了两种可能的解决方案。第一种基于三个无监督学习度量（Silhouette、Calinski-Harabasz和Davies-Bouldin），而第二种则采用了多层感知器等回归算法的最常见错误度量方法。",
