Unlike other neural SAT solving methods, NeuRes is capable of proving unsatisfiability as opposed to merely predicting it. By design, NeuRes operates in a certificate-driven fashion by employing propositional resolution to prove unsatisfiability and to accelerate the process of finding satisfying truth assignments in case of unsat and sat formulas, respectively. To realize this, we propose a novel architecture that adapts elements from Graph Neural Networks and Pointer Networks to autoregressively select pairs of nodes from a dynamic graph structure, which is essential to the generation of resolution proofs. Our model is trained and evaluated on a dataset of teacher proofs and truth assignments that we compiled with the same random formula distribution used by NeuroSAT. In our experiments, we show that NeuRes solves more test formulas than NeuroSAT by a rather wide margin on different distributions while being much more data",

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了一种神经符号证明为基础的SAT解析器NeuRes。与其他神经SAT解算法不同，NeuRes能够证明不可满足性，而不仅仅是预测它。NeuRes通过采用命题推理来证明不可满足性并加速在不可满足和可满足公式中找到满足真值分配的过程。为了实现这一点，我们提出了一种新颖的架构，它结合了图神经网络和指针网络的元素，从动态图结构中自动选择节点对，这对于生成解析证明是至关重要的。我们使用与NeuroSAT相同的随机公式分布编制了一个包含教师证明和真值分配的数据集，对我们的模型进行训练和评估。在实验证明中，我们展示了NeuRes在不同分布上比NeuroSAT解决更多的测试公式，并且需要更少的数据。",
