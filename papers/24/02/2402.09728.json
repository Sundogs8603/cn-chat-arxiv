In recent past, we have also observed a rapid advancement of conversational generative AI chatbot services (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's BARD), which are powered by pre-trained large language models (LLMs). These AI chatbots certainly have a lot of utilities but it is not systematically understood how they can play a role in creating threats and attacks. In this paper, we propose AbuseGPT method to show how the existing generative AI-based chatbot services can be exploited by attackers in real world to create smishing texts and eventually lead to craftier smishing campaigns. To the best of our knowledge, there is no pre-existing work that evidently shows the impacts of these generative text-based models on creating SMS phishing. Thus, ",

    "translated_abstract": "SMS钓鱼，也被称为“smishing”，是一种通过欺诈性移动短信诱骗用户透露私人信息或点击带有恶意内容的URL的不断增长的威胁。最近，我们还观察到了会话生成型AI聊天机器人服务（如OpenAI的ChatGPT，Google的BARD）的快速发展，它们由预训练的大型语言模型（LLM）驱动。这些AI聊天机器人确实具有很多用途，但尚未系统地了解它们如何在创建威胁和攻击方面发挥作用。在本文中，我们提出了滥用GPT的方法，展示了现有的生成型AI聊天机器人服务如何被攻击者在真实世界中利用，创建短信钓鱼文本，最终导致更聪明的短信钓鱼攻击活动。据我们所知，目前尚无现有的工作明确显示这些生成型文本模型在创建SMS钓鱼方面的影响。",
