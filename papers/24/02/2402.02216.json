    "translated_abstract": "图基础模型（Graph Foundation Model，GFM）是图领域中一个新兴的研究课题，旨在开发一个能够跨不同图和任务进行泛化的图模型。然而，目前还没有实现一个多功能的GFM。构建GFM的关键挑战在于如何能在具有不同结构模式的图之间实现正向迁移。受计算机视觉（CV）和自然语言处理（NLP）领域基础模型的启发，我们提出了一种新的 GFM 发展视角，通过倡导“图词汇表”，即潜藏于图中的基本可迁移单元来编码图的不变性。我们从网络分析、理论基础和稳定性等重要方面来建立图词汇表。这种词汇表的视角有助于按照神经缩放定律推进未来的GFM设计。",
