    "translated_abstract": "异常检测在许多基于web的应用程序中起着重要作用，包括恶意软件检测、反洗钱、设备故障检测和网络故障分析。大多数依赖于无监督学习的方法由于缺乏标签而难以达到令人满意的检测精度。弱监督异常检测 (WSAD) 引入了有限数量的带标签异常样本来提高模型性能。然而，对于在有限的标记数据上训练的模型来说，泛化到未见异常仍然具有挑战性。在本文中，我们引入了一种新颖的框架Knowledge-Data Alignment (KDAlign)，将通常由人工专家总结的规则知识集成到有限的带标签数据中以补充。具体而言，我们将这些规则转化为知识空间，并将知识与数据的融合重新映射为知识和数据的对齐。为了促进这种对齐，我们采用了最优传输方法。",
