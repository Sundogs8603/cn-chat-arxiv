The goal is to model HT detection more closely to the real world, i.e., describing the problem as \"The Seeker's Dilemma\" (an extension of Hide&Seek on a graph), where a detecting agent is unaware of whether circuits are infected by HTs or not. Using this theoretical problem formulation, we create a benchmark that consists of a mixture of HT-free and HT-infected restructured circuits while preserving their original functionalities. The restructured circuits are randomly infected by HTs, causing a situation where the defender is uncertain if a circuit is infected or not.

    "translated_abstract": "这项工作致力于在硬件设计领域推进安全研究，通过正式定义硬件特洛伊（HT）检测的现实问题。其目标是更接近现实世界地建模HT检测，即以\"搜索者的困境\"（在图上的扩展版Hide&Seek）描述问题，其中检测代理不知道电路是否被HT感染。利用这个理论问题公式化，我们创建了一个基准，由混合的无HT和有HT感染的重构电路组成，同时保留它们的原始功能。重构的电路被随机感染HT，导致防御者不确定电路是否被感染。我们相信我们的创新数据集将帮助社区通过比较不同方法在电路分类中的成功率来更好地评判检测质量。我们利用我们开发的基准来评估",
