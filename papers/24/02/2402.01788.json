    "translated_abstract": "进行科学论文的文献综述对于理解研究、其限制以及构建在现有工作基础上是必不可少的。这是一项繁琐的任务，因此自动文献综述生成器变得有吸引力。然而，许多使用大型语言模型（LLM）生成此类综述的现有工作存在显著限制。它们倾向于产生虚构的非实际信息，并忽略它们未受过训练的最新研究。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一个基于检索增强生成（RAG）原则的工具包，在LLM的帮助下，使用专门的提示和指导技术。我们的系统首先通过将用户提供的摘要转化为关键词来进行网络搜索，以检索相关论文，其中使用了现成的LLM。作者可以通过补充相关论文或关键词来改进搜索，从而实现定制化的检索过程。其次，系统根据-",
