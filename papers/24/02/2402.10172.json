    "translated_abstract": "优化问题在制造业、分销业和医疗保健等领域普遍存在。然而，大多数这类问题仍然是通过手工启发式方法解决的，而不是通过最先进的求解器进行最优解，因为需要专业知识来制定和解决这些问题，限制了优化工具和技术的广泛应用。本文介绍了OptiMUS，一个基于大型语言模型(LLM)的代理，旨在根据自然语言描述来制定和解决(混合整数)线性规划问题。OptiMUS可以开发数学模型，编写和调试求解器代码，评估生成的解决方案，并根据这些评估改进其模型和代码。OptiMUS使用模块化结构处理问题，使其能够处理具有长说明和复杂数据的问题而无需长提示。实验表明，OptiMUS在简单的数据集上优于现有的最先进方法。",
