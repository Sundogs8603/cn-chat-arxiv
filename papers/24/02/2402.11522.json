By analyzing a large dataset of interactions between real users and thousands of characters, we systematically examine multiple factors and assess their impact on user retention rate.

    "translated_abstract": "随着对话代理变得越来越类人化，人们现在正在进行持续对话，可以从短暂的时刻延伸到长时间。理解促使这些互动持续的因素至关重要，然而现有研究主要集中在很少探索这种长时间和真实对话的短期模拟。在本文中，我们研究了影响角色扮演模型与真实用户之间互动中保留率的因素。通过分析真实用户和数千个角色之间的大型数据集，我们系统地检查了多个因素，并评估了它们对用户保留率的影响。令人惊讶的是，我们发现机器人体现其扮演角色的程度对保留率的影响有限，而其讲话的每个轮次的长度显著影响保留率。这项研究揭示了用户参与度的关键方面。",
