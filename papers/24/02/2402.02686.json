    "translated_abstract": "研究不同脑区之间复杂的相互作用对神经科学至关重要。各种统计方法已经探索了多个脑区之间潜在的通讯。两个主要的类别是高斯过程（GP）和线性动态系统（LDS），每个方法都具有独特的优势。基于GP的方法有效地发现了潜在变量，如频带和通讯方向。相反，基于LDS的方法在计算效率上高，但在潜在表示方面缺乏强大的表达能力。在本研究中，我们通过创建一个与多输出GP相对应的LDS，即多区域马尔可夫高斯过程（MRM-GP），将这两种方法合二为一。我们的工作首次建立了LDS和多输出GP之间的联系，在神经记录的潜在空间中明确建模了频率和相位延迟。因此，该模型在时间点上实现了线性推断成本，并提供了可解释的低维表示。",
