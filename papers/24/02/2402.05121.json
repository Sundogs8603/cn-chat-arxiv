    "translated_abstract": "表格通常是二维结构化的，用于存储大量数据，在数据库查询、电子表格计算和从网络表格生成报告等日常活动中起着重要作用。利用大型语言模型（LLMs）自动化这些以表格为中心的任务可以带来重大的公众利益，引起了学术界和工业界的兴趣。该调查对表格任务进行了广泛的概述，不仅涵盖传统领域如表格问题回答（Table QA）和事实验证，还包括最近强调的方面，如表格操作和高级表格数据分析。此外，它还超越了早期的预训练和微调小型语言模型的策略，包括LLM使用中的最新范例。重点是LLMs领域内的指导调整、提示和基于代理的方法。最后，我们重点介绍了几个挑战，涵盖私有部署、高效推断和 LLMS 发展等方面。",
