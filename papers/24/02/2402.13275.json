The model is based on the hypothesis that the cerebral cortex predicts actions, while the basal ganglia use reinforcement learning to decide whether to perform the actions predicted by the cortex. The implementation is intended to be used as a component of models of the brain consisting of cortical regions or brain-inspired cognitive architectures.",
