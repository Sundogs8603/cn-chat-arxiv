    "translated_abstract": "传统的因果发现方法依赖于集中式数据，这与许多实际情况下数据的分散性质不一致。这种差异推动了联邦因果发现（FCD）方法的发展。然而，现有的FCD方法可能受到其对可识别功能因果模型或 homogeneous数据分布的潜在限制，从而限制了它们在各种场景中的适用性。在本文中，我们提出了一种尝试适应任意因果模型和异构数据的新型FCD方法。我们首先利用与客户端索引对应的替代变量，以解决不同客户端之间的数据异质性。然后我们开发了一个用于因果骨架发现的联邦条件独立性检验（FCIT），并建立了一个用于确定因果方向的联邦独立变化原则（FICP）。这些方法涉及构建",
