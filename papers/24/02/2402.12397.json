    "translated_abstract": "时间序列数据可以代表无人系统（如无人机和自动驾驶汽车）的行为。在这一领域，二元和多类别分类问题受到了广泛关注。神经网络是一种流行的分类数据的方法；然而，它们缺乏可解释性，这在从中提取有意义的信息方面构成了重要挑战。信号时间逻辑（STL）是一种描述定时行为属性的形式化语言。我们提出了一种将所有这些元素结合在一起的方法：使用表示STL规范的神经网络进行时间序列数据的多类别分类。我们提供了两个关键贡献：1）我们引入了多类别分类的边界概念，2）我们引入了基于STL的属性来增强结果的可解释性。我们在两个数据集上评估了我们的方法，并与最先进的基准进行了比较。",
