    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11625v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In the digital era, the widespread use of APIs is evident. However, scalable utilization of APIs poses a challenge due to structure divergence observed in online API documentation. This underscores the need for automatic tools to facilitate API consumption. A viable approach involves the conversion of documentation into an API Specification format. While previous attempts have been made using rule-based methods, these approaches encountered difficulties in generalizing across diverse documentation. In this paper we introduce SpeCrawler, a comprehensive system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate OpenAPI Specifications from diverse API documentation through a carefully crafted pipeline. By creating a standardized format for numerous APIs, SpeCrawler aids in streamlining integration processes within API orchestrating systems and facilitating the incorporation of tools into LLMs. The paper explores SpeCrawler's methodology",

    "translated_abstract": "在数字时代，API的广泛使用是显而易见的。但由于在线API文档中观察到的结构差异，对API的可扩展利用构成了挑战。这凸显了需要自动化工具来促进API的使用。一种可行的方法是将文档转换成API规范格式。尽管先前尝试使用基于规则的方法，但这些方法在跨不同文档中普遍化方面遇到了困难。本文介绍了SpeCrawler，这是一个全面的系统，利用大型语言模型(LLMs)通过精心设计的流程从不同的API文档生成OpenAPI规范。通过为众多API创建一个标准化格式，SpeCrawler有助于简化API编排系统中的集成流程，并促进将工具整合到LLMs中。本文探讨了SpeCrawler的方法论。",
