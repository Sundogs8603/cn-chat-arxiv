    "translated_abstract": "在过去的几十年里，信息和互联网技术的快速发展催生了大量的数据和信息。信息爆炸推动许多企业或个人寻求租用云计算基础设施来将他们的应用程序放置在云中。然而，云计算提供商和客户之间达成的协议通常不高效。许多因素影响效率，如提供商云计算基础设施的闲置和对客户的额外成本。一个可能的解决方案是引入一种综合的、谈判类的博弈，并根据谈判结果安排资源。我们提出了一种基于模糊逻辑的基于代理的自动谈判系统用于资源调度。所提出的方法可以完成一对一的自动谈判过程，并为提供商和客户生成最优的报价。我们比较了不同成员函数、模糊规则集和网络拓扑结构对资源调度的影响。",
