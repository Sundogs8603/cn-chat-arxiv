    "abstract": "Instruction tuning has emerged as a prominent methodology for teaching Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow instructions. However, current instruction datasets predominantly cater to English or are derived from English-dominated LLMs, resulting in inherent biases toward Western culture. This bias significantly impacts the linguistic structures of non-English languages such as Arabic, which has a distinct grammar reflective of the diverse cultures across the Arab region. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing CIDAR: https://hf.co/datasets/arbml/CIDAR, the first open Arabic instruction-tuning dataset culturally-aligned by human reviewers. CIDAR contains 10,000 instruction and output pairs that represent the Arab region. We discuss the cultural relevance of CIDAR via the analysis and comparison to other models fine-tuned on other datasets. Our experiments show that CIDAR can help enrich research efforts in aligning LLMs with the Arabic culture. All the code is available at ",

    "translated_abstract": "指令调优已成为教授大型语言模型遵循指令的一种重要方法。然而，现有的指令数据集主要面向英语或者来源于以英语为主导的语言模型，导致对西方文化的固有偏见。这种偏见对阿拉伯文等非英语语言的语言结构产生了重大影响，阿拉伯文反映了阿拉伯地区多样文化的独特语法。本文通过引入CIDAR，即第一个由人工评审对齐文化的阿拉伯指令调优数据集（https://hf.co/datasets/arbml/CIDAR），来解决这一限制。CIDAR包含了代表阿拉伯地区的10000个指令与输出对。我们通过对比分析其他模型在其他数据集上的调优结果，讨论了CIDAR的文化相关性。实验证明CIDAR可以帮助丰富将语言模型与阿拉伯文化对齐的研究工作。所有代码都可在...上找到。",
