    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了机器学习中的可解释性问题。为了解决这个问题，特征归因方法（FAMs）通过扰动测试来测量每个特征的贡献，其中在不同扰动下的预测差异进行比较。然而，在特征的预测变化相同的情况下，这种扰动测试可能无法准确区分不同特征的贡献。为了增强FAMs在这种具有挑战性的情况下区分不同特征贡献的能力，我们提出利用扰动一个特征对预测变化起到必要性和充分性作用的概率（PNS）作为特征重要性的度量。我们的方法，利用必要性和充分性进行特征归因（FANS），通过涉及两个阶段（事实性和干预性）的扰动测试计算PNS。在实践中，为了生成反事实样本，我们使用了一个重新...",
