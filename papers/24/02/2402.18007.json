    "translated_abstract": "最近，MLP结构重新受到关注，其中MLP-Mixer以其突出的表现脱颖而出。在计算机视觉领域，MLP-Mixer以从通道和令牌两个角度提取数据信息的能力而闻名，有效地作为通道信息和令牌信息的融合。事实上，Mixer代表了一种信息提取范式，将通道和令牌信息融合在一起。Mixer的精髓在于它能够从多元视角融合信息，典型地体现了在神经网络架构领域的“混合”真正概念。除了考虑通道和令牌以外，可以从各种角度创造更贴合特定任务需求的混合器。本研究专注于音频识别领域，引入一种名为带Roll-Time和Hermit FFT的音频频谱混合器(ASM-RH)的创新模型，该模型结合了对时间和频率的洞察。",
