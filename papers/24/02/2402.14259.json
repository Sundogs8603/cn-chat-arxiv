    "translated_abstract": "不确定性估计在确保安全关键的人工智能系统与人类互动的可靠性中发挥关键作用，尤其在医疗领域尤为重要。然而，在自由形式的医学问答任务中，尚未建立一种通用方法来量化答案的不确定性，其中无关的词汇和语序含有有限的语义信息可能是不确定性的主要来源，这是由于生成不平等的存在。本文提出了单词序列熵（WSE），该方法根据语义相关性在单词和序列级别上校准不确定性比例，在不确定性量化时更加强调关键词和更相关的序列。我们在5个自由形式医学问答数据集上，利用7种“现成的”大语言模型（LLMs）将WSE与6种基线方法进行比较，并展示了WSE在性能上的优越性。",
