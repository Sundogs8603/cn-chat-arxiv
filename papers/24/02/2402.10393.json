    "title": "Darwin Turing Dawkins: Building a General Theory of Evolution",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.10393v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Living things, computers, societies, and even books are part of a grand evolutionary struggle to survive. That struggle shapes nature, nations, religions, art, science, and you. What you think, feel, and do is determined by it. Darwinian evolution does not apply solely to the genes that are stored in DNA. Using the insights of Alan Turing and Richard Dawkins, we will see that it also applies to the memes we store in our brains and the information we store in our computers. The next time you run for president, fight a war, or just deal with the ordinary problems humans are heir to, perhaps this book will be of use. If you want to understand why and when you will die, or if you want to achieve greatness this book may help. If you are concerned about where the computer revolution is headed, this book may provide some answers.",

    "translated_title": "达尔文 图灵 邓金斯：建立一个普遍的进化论",
    "translated_abstract": "生物、计算机、社会，甚至书籍都是参与一个宏大的进化生存斗争的一部分。这场生存斗争塑造了自然、国家、宗教、艺术、科学以及你自己。你的思想、感觉和行为都受其影响。达尔文进化论不仅适用于存储在DNA中的基因。运用艾伦·图灵和理查德·道金斯的洞见，我们将看到它也适用于存储在我们大脑中的模因和存储在计算机中的信息。下次你竞选总统、参与战争，或者只是处理人类普遍问题时，也许这本书会有所帮助。如果你想了解为什么以及何时会死亡，或者想要取得伟大成就，这本书可能会有所帮助。如果你关心计算机革命的发展方向，这本书可能会提供一些答案。",
