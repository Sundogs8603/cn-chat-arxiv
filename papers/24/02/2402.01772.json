    "translated_abstract": "多语言机器翻译(MMT)在不同语言对之间的知识转移中受益。然而，一对多翻译相比于多对一翻译的改进仅有微小甚至可忽略不计。这种性能差异引发了一个问题：在一对多MT中，正向转移在目标端的作用程度如何。在本文中，我们进行了一项大规模研究，通过语言相似性和语料库大小这两个维度变化辅助目标语言，以展示知识转移对主要语言对的动态影响。我们发现，语言相似的辅助目标语言表现出强大的正向知识转移能力。随着相似目标语言规模的增加，正向转移进一步增强，使主要语言对受益。同时，我们发现远离的辅助目标语言也可以出乎意料地使主要语言对受益，即使正向转移最小也是如此。",
