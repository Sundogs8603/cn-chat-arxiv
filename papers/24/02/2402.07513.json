    "abstract": "In the field of spoken language understanding, systems like Whisper and Multilingual Massive Speech (MMS) have shown state-of-the-art performances. This study is dedicated to a comprehensive exploration of the Whisper and MMS systems, with a focus on assessing biases in automatic speech recognition (ASR) inherent to casual conversation speech specific to the Portuguese language. Our investigation encompasses various categories, including gender, age, skin tone color, and geo-location. Alongside traditional ASR evaluation metrics such as Word Error Rate (WER), we have incorporated p-value statistical significance for gender bias analysis.

    "translated_abstract": "在口语理解领域，像Whisper和Multilingual Massive Speech（MMS）这样的系统展示了最先进的性能。本研究致力于对Whisper和MMS系统进行全面探索，重点评估与葡萄牙语特定的非正式对话语音中的自动语音识别（ASR）偏见。我们的调查涵盖了各种类别，包括性别、年龄、肤色和地理位置。除了传统的ASR评估指标，如词错误率（WER），我们还使用p值统计显著性来分析性别偏见。此外，我们广泛研究了数据分布的影响，并从实证角度表明过采样技术缓解了这种陈规定型偏见。本研究通过MMS和Whisper的应用，在葡萄牙语环境中量化偏见方面做出了开创性的努力，为更好地理解ASR系统做出了贡献。",
