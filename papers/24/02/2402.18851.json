This challenge is particularly evident in personalized healthcare decision-making, where models need to take into account the intricate relationships between patient characteristics, treatment options, and health outcomes. To address this, we introduce prescriptive networks (PNNs), shallow 0-1 neural networks trained with mixed integer programming that can be used with counterfactual estimation to optimize policies in medium data settings. These models offer greater interpretability than deep neural networks and can encode more complex policies than common models such as decision trees.
