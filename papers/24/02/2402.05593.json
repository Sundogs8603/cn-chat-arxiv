Our proposed solution allows real-time reconstruction on-site, for instance, within an exhibition, or to generate a useful starting point for an expert, trying to manually reconstruct the statue, all while using only synthetic data for training.",

    "translated_abstract": "在中世纪，灰泥工人使用一种称为辛诺比亚的红色颜料在墙上先制作雕像的素描。如今，许多这些雕像已经被摧毁，但是利用原始的辛诺比亚素描，我们可以重建最终雕像的样子。我们提出了一种全自动的方法来重建点云，并通过生成彩色图像、深度图和表面法线来展示初步结果，只需要一张简单的素描，而不需要其他类似样本的集合。我们提出的解决方案可以实时在现场进行重建，例如在展览中，或者为专家提供一个有用的起点，试图手动重建雕像，同时只使用合成数据进行训练。",
