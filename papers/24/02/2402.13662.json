    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种方法，用于上下界定连续随机变量（RVs）的右尾和左尾概率。对于具有概率密度函数$f_X(x)$的RV $X$的右尾概率，该方法首先要求设置一个连续的、正的、严格递减的函数$g_X(x)$，使得$-f_X(x)/g'_X(x)$是一个递减且递增的函数，$\\forall x>x_0$，分别给出形式为$-f_X(x) g_X(x)/g'_X(x)$的上界和下界，$\\forall x>x_0$，其中$x_0$是某个点。类似地，对于$X$的左尾概率的上下界，该方法首先要求设置一个连续的、正的、严格递增的函数$g_X(x)$，使得$f_X(x)/g'_X(x)$是一个增加且递减的函数，$\\forall x<x_0$。我们提供了一些函数$g_X(x)$的良好候选示例。我们还建立了新界限与马尔可夫不等式的联系。",
