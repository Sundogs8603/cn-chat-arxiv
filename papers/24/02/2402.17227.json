    "translated_abstract": "基于采样的算法在前向传播和/或反向传播中消除“不重要”的计算，为加速神经网络训练提供潜在解决方案。然而，由于采样引入了训练的近似，这些算法可能无法在各种任务中始终保持准确性。在本研究中，我们介绍了一种旨在加速反向传播的方差控制自适应采样（VCAS）方法。VCAS通过数据维度中的细粒度逐层重要性采样来计算无偏随机梯度以进行激活梯度计算，并通过标记维度中的杠杆分数采样来进行权重梯度计算。为了保持准确性，我们在训练过程中通过学习样本比率联合学习模型参数来控制额外的方差。我们在视觉和自然语言领域的多个微调和预训练任务上评估了VCAS。在所有任务上，VCAS能够保持原始的精度。",
