We therefore propose to formulate a graph upon narratives dubbed NARCO that depicts a task-agnostic coherence dependency of the entire context. Especially, edges in NARCO encompass retrospective free-form questions between two context snippets reflecting high-level coherent relations, inspired by the cognitive perception of humans who constantly reinstate relevant events from prior context. Importantly, our graph is instantiated through our designed two-stage LLM prompting, thereby without reliance on human annotations. We present three unique studies on its practical utility, examining the edge efficacy via recap identification, local context augmentation via plot retrieval, and broader applications exemplified by long document QA.

    "translated_abstract": "这项工作介绍了一种新颖且实用的叙事理解范式，这是基于一个观察：叙述中的个别段落通常是相互关联的，而不是孤立的。因此，我们提出在叙事中形成一个名为NARCO的图，描述整个背景的任务无关的连贯依赖。特别是，NARCO中的边涵盖了两个上下文片段之间的自由形式回顾性问题，反映了高层次的连贯关系，受到人类认知感知的启发，人类不断从先前背景中重申相关事件。重要的是，我们的图是通过我们设计的两阶段LLM提示实例化的，因此无需依赖人类注释。我们展示了三个关于其实际效用的独特研究，通过总结识别检验边的有效性，通过情节检索进行本地上下文增强，以及通过长文档问答示例化的更广泛应用。",
