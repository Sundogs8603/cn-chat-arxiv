Our novel approach embeds the mean-field model in a classical setup, but retains the crucial feature of controlling the term rate's variances over large time horizons. This maintains the market model's practicability, since calibrations and simulations can be carried out efficiently without nested simulations. In addition, we show that our framework can be directly applied to model term rates derived from SOFR, ESTR or other nearly risk-free overnight short-term rates -- a crucial feature since many IBOR rates are gradually being replaced. These results are complemented by a calibration study and some theoretical arguments which allow to estimate the probability of unrealistically high rates in the presented market models.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们对Desmettre等人在arXiv:2109.10779中引入的均场LIBOR市场模型提出了一种替代视角。我们的新方法将均场模型嵌入到一个经典设置中，但保留了在长时间范围内控制期限利率方差的关键特征。这保持了市场模型的实用性，因为可以高效地进行校准和模拟，而无需嵌套模拟。此外，我们展示了我们的框架可以直接应用于建模来自SOFR、ESTR或其他几乎无风险的隔夜短期利率的期限利率 ——这是一个至关重要的特征，因为许多IBOR利率正在逐渐被替换。这些结果由一项校准研究和一些理论论证来补充，这些理论论证可以用来估计所呈现的市场模型中出现不现实高利率的概率。",
