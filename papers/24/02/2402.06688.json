    "translated_abstract": "已经提出了几种方法来纠正数字高程模型（DEM）中的高程偏差，例如线性回归。如今，监督式机器学习可以对变量之间的复杂关系进行建模，并已被研究人员在各个领域中应用。在现有文献中，有几项研究采用了机器学习或统计方法来进行DEM校正的任务。然而，据我们所知，这些研究中没有一项比较了这两种方法的性能，特别是针对开放获取的全球DEM数据。我们以前的工作已经展示了机器学习方法的潜力，特别是梯度提升决策树（GBDT）在DEM校正中的应用。在本研究中，我们分享了对比三种最近实施的梯度提升决策树（XGBoost，LightGBM和CatBoost）和多元线性回归（MLR）的结果，以提高30米的Copernicus DEM的垂直精度。",
