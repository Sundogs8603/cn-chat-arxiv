    "abstract": "With the wide deployment of multimodal learning systems (MMLS) in real-world scenarios, safety concerns have become increasingly prominent. The absence of systematic research into their safety is a significant barrier to progress in this field. To bridge the gap, we present the first taxonomy for MMLS safety, identifying four essential pillars of these concerns. Leveraging this taxonomy, we conduct in-depth reviews for each pillar, highlighting key limitations based on the current state of development. Finally, we pinpoint unique challenges in MMLS safety and provide potential directions for future research.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着多模态学习系统在现实场景中的广泛应用，安全问题变得越来越突出。对于这一领域的安全问题缺乏系统性研究已成为一个重要的障碍。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了第一个多模态学习系统安全的分类法，确定了这些问题的四个关键支柱。借助这一分类法，我们对每个支柱进行了深入审查，突出了当前发展状态的关键限制。最后，我们指出了多模态学习系统安全面临的独特挑战，并提供了未来研究的潜在方向。",
