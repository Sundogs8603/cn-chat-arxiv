The adoption of LLMs for personal and professional use is fueled by the natural interactions between human users and computer applications such as ChatGPT, along with powerful summarization and text generation capabilities. Given the widespread use of such generative AI tools, in this work we investigate how these tools can be deployed in a non-safety critical, strategic traffic flow management setting. Specifically, we train an LLM, CHATATC, based on a large historical data set of Ground Delay Program (GDP) issuances, spanning 2000-2023 and consisting of over 80,000 GDP implementations, revisions, and cancellations. We test the query and response capabilities of CHATATC, documenting successes (e.g., providing correct GDP rates, durations, and reason) and shortcomings (e.g,. superlative",

    "translated_abstract": "生成人工智能（AI）和大型语言模型（LLMs）已经通过诸如ChatGPT等公开可用工具快速走红。LLMs在个人和专业领域的应用得到推动，是由于人类用户与ChatGPT等计算机应用之间自然的互动，以及强大的摘要和文本生成能力。在这项工作中，我们调查了这些生成AI工具如何在非安全关键的战略交通流量管理环境中部署。具体来说，我们基于包含超过80,000个GDP实施、修订和取消的大量历史数据集，对CHATATC进行训练。我们测试了CHATATC的查询和响应能力，记录了成功之处（例如，提供正确的GDP率、持续时间和原因）以及不足之处（例如，最高水平）",
