    "abstract": "Laughter is one of the most expressive and natural aspects of human speech, conveying emotions, social cues, and humor. However, most text-to-speech (TTS) systems lack the ability to produce realistic and appropriate laughter sounds, limiting their applications and user experience. While there have been prior works to generate natural laughter, they fell short in terms of controlling the timing and variety of the laughter to be generated. In this work, we propose ELaTE, a zero-shot TTS that can generate natural laughing speech of any speaker based on a short audio prompt with precise control of laughter timing and expression. Specifically, ELaTE works on the audio prompt to mimic the voice characteristic, the text prompt to indicate the contents of the generated speech, and the input to control the laughter expression, which can be either the start and end times of laughter, or the additional audio prompt that contains laughter to be mimicked. We develop our model based on the foundati",

    "translated_abstract": "笑声是人类语音中最表达性和自然的一部分，传达着情感、社交暗示和幽默。然而，大多数文本到语音(TTS)系统缺乏产生逼真且合适的笑声的能力，限制了其应用和用户体验。虽然之前有工作生成了自然的笑声，但在控制生成的笑声的时机和多样性方面仍存在不足。在这项工作中，我们提出了ELaTE，一种可以基于短音频提示以精确控制笑声时机和表情的零样本TTS系统，可以产生任何说话者的自然笑声。具体而言，ELaTE通过音频提示来模仿声音特征，通过文本提示来指示所生成语音的内容，通过输入来控制笑声表情，可以是笑声的起始和结束时间，或包含要模仿的笑声的另外音频提示。我们的模型基于找到的技术基础进行了开发。",
