    "translated_abstract": "GitHub和GitLab等平台引入问题报告模板（IRT）以提高问题管理效率并更好地与开发者期望对齐。然而，大多数仓库并未广泛采用这些模板，并且目前没有可用的工具来辅助开发者生成模板。在这项工作中，我们介绍了GIRT-模型，这是一个基于开发者关于结构和必需字段的指示自动生成IRT的助理语言模型。我们创建了GIRT-Instruct，这是一个包含指示和IRT对的数据集，其中IRT来自GitHub存储库。我们使用GIRT-Instruct来指导调整T5-base模型以创建GIRT-模型。在我们的实验中，GIRT-模型在IRT生成方面表现优于通用语言模型（带有不同参数大小的T5和Flan-T5），在ROUGE、BLEU、METEOR和人工评估上得分显著更高。此外，我们分析了GIRT-模型在用户体验中的有效性。",
