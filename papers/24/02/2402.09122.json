    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种贝叶斯非参数的信号分离方法，其中信号可以根据潜变量变化。我们的主要贡献是增加了高斯过程潜变量模型（GPLVMs），以包括每个数据点由已知数量的纯组分信号的加权和组成的情况，并观察多个输入位置。我们的框架允许使用各种关于每个观测权重的先验。这种灵活性使我们能够表示包括用于估计分数组成的总和为一约束和用于分类的二进制权重的用例。我们的贡献对于光谱学尤其相关，因为改变条件可能导致基础纯组分信号在样本之间变化。为了展示对光谱学和其他领域的适用性，我们考虑了几个应用：一个具有不同温度的近红外光谱数据集。",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper proposes a Bayesian non-parametric approach using Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) to separate signals that vary according to latent variables. The key contribution is the ability to incorporate a weighted sum of known pure component signals for each data point, with flexibility in the choice of priors for the observation weights. The method is particularly relevant to spectroscopy and has applications in various domains."
