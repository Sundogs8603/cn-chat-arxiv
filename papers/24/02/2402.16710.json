    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们研究了一个带有双重对象的最佳臂识别问题。除了传统的奖励外，每个臂还与成本分布相关联，目标是使用最小期望成本识别出最大奖励臂。我们称之为“成本意识最佳臂识别”（CABAI），它捕捉了产品开发流程中测试和实施阶段之间的分离，并模拟了阶段之间的目标转变，即测试的成本和实施的奖励。我们首先为CABAI推导了一个理论下限，并提出了一个名为$\\mathsf{CTAS}$的算法来渐近匹配它。为了减少$\\mathsf{CTAS}$的计算量，我们进一步提出了一个基于平方根规则的低复杂度算法称为CO，在简化的双臂模型中证明了其最优性，并在数值实验中表现出惊人的泛化能力。",
