    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.17870v1 通告类型：跨领域 摘要：期望最大化（EM）算法是一种广泛用于经验贝叶斯推断的方法，但其期望步骤（E步骤）经常难以处理。采用带有马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）的随机逼近方案可以避开这个问题，得到一种称为MCMC-SAEM的算法。虽然先前已经确立了MCMC-SAEM的理论保证，但这些结果仅适用于使用渐近无偏MCMC算法的情况。在实践中，MCMC-SAEM经常使用渐近有偏的MCMC运行，对于这种情况，其理论后果尚不为人了解。在这项工作中，我们通过分析带有偏置MCMC步骤的SAEM的渐近性和非渐近性，特别是偏置的影响来填补这一空白。我们还提供了比较Metropolis调整的朗维新算法（MALA）和未经调整的朗维新算法（ULA）的数值实验。",
