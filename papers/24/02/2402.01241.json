    "translated_abstract": "近期，在深度生成模型中，特别是应用CLIP（对比语言图像预训练）到去噪扩散概率模型（DDPMs）的生成图像的应用方面取得了显著的效果。CLIP的结构化嵌入空间也被扩展到图像到形状的生成，并取得了显著的结果。尽管取得了这些成功，但是仍然存在一些基本的问题：CLIP是否能确保从图像中生成最佳的形状？我们能否利用条件来将显式的三维知识引入生成过程并获得更好的质量？本研究介绍了CISP（对比图像形状预训练），旨在通过将2D图像与3D形状在共享嵌入空间中进行对齐来增强3D形状合成。CISP旨在丰富CLIP框架，通过捕捉CLIP的文本图像关注可能忽视的3D特征。我们的综合分析评估了CISP的质量。",
