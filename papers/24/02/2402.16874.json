    "translated_abstract": "在智能技术日新月异的世界中，由于先进语言模型的崛起，搜索文档变得更具挑战性。这些模型有时会面临困难，比如提供不准确的信息，通常被称为“幻觉”。本研究致力于通过检索增强生成（RAG）技术解决这一问题，该技术指导模型基于真实事实提供准确答复。为了解决可伸缩性问题，研究探讨了将用户查询与诸如BERT和Orca2等复杂语言模型连接起来的创新查询优化过程。研究展开在三种情境中：首先，没有RAG，其次，没有额外帮助，最后，加入额外帮助。选择紧凑而高效的Orca2 7B模型展示出对计算资源的智能使用。实证结果表明，初始语言模型的性能有了显著提升。",
