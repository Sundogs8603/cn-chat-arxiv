    "abstract": "Point clouds and high-resolution 3D data have become increasingly important in various fields, including surveying, construction, and virtual reality. However, simply having this data is not enough; to extract useful information, semantic labeling is crucial. In this context, we propose a method to transfer annotations from a labeled to an unlabeled point cloud using an octree structure. The structure also analyses changes between the point clouds. Our experiments confirm that our method effectively transfers annotations while addressing changes. The primary contribution of this project is the development of the method for automatic label transfer between two different point clouds that represent the same real-world object. The proposed method can be of great importance for data-driven deep learning algorithms as it can also allow circumventing stochastic transfer learning by deterministic label transfer between datasets depicting the same objects.",

    "translated_abstract": "点云和高分辨率的三维数据在测绘、建筑和虚拟现实等领域越来越重要。然而，仅有这些数据是不够的，语义标签对于提取有用信息至关重要。在这个背景下，我们提出了一种使用八叉树结构将标签从一个已标注的点云转移到一个未标注的点云的方法。该结构还分析了点云之间的变化。我们的实验证实了我们的方法在解决变化的同时有效地转移标签。本项目的主要贡献是开发了一种方法，可以在表示同一真实世界对象的两个不同点云之间进行自动标签转移。该方法对于数据驱动的深度学习算法非常重要，因为它还可以通过两个数据集之间的确定性标签转移来规避随机转移学习。",
