When these events occur, traditional classrooms with traditional or blended delivery can shift to fully online learning, which requires an efficient learning environment that meets students' needs. While learning management systems support teachers' productivity and creativity, they typically provide the same content to all learners in a course, ignoring their unique learning styles. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised machine learning approach that detects students' learning styles using a data mining technique. We use the commonly used Felder Silverman learning style model and demonstrate that our semi-supervised method can produce reliable classification models with few labeled data. We evaluate our approach on two different courses and achieve an",

    "translated_abstract": "教育是一个必须适应突如其来的变化和由大流行病、战争和与气候变化有关的自然灾害等事件引起的干扰的动态领域。当这些事件发生时，传统课堂以传统或融合方式提供的教学可以转变为完全在线学习，这需要一个能够满足学生需求的高效学习环境。虽然学习管理系统支持教师的生产力和创造力，但它们通常向课程中所有学习者提供相同的内容，忽略了他们独特的学习风格。为解决这一问题，我们提出了一种半监督机器学习方法，利用数据挖掘技术来检测学生的学习风格。我们使用了常用的Felder Silverman学习风格模型，并证明我们的半监督方法可以利用少量标记数据产生可靠的分类模型。我们在两门不同课程上评估了我们的方法，并取得了",
