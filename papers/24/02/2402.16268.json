To codify how foundation model developers should provide transparency about the development and deployment of their models, we propose Foundation Model Transparency Reports, drawing upon the transparency reporting practices in social media. While external documentation of societal harms prompted social media transparency reports, our objective is to institutionalize transparency reporting for foundation models while the industry is still nascent. To design our reports, we identify 6 design principles given the successes and shortcomings of social media transparency reporting. To further schematize our reports, we draw upon the 100 transparency indicators from the Foundation Model Transparency Index.

    "translated_abstract": "基础模型是具有广泛社会影响的关键数字技术，需要透明度。为了规范基础模型开发者应如何提供有关其模型开发和部署的透明度，我们提出了基础模型透明度报告，借鉴社交媒体的透明度报告实践。尽管社交媒体透明度报告是由外部对社会伤害的文档促成的，我们的目标是在行业仍处于萌芽阶段时为基础模型制定透明度报告。为设计我们的报告，我们确定了6条设计原则，考虑了社交媒体透明度报告的成功和不足。为了进一步使我们的报告系统化，我们借鉴了基础模型透明度指数的100个透明度指标。根据这些指标，我们测量它们与六个主要透明度要求中包含的透明度要求的重叠程度。",
