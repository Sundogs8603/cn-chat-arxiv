    "translated_abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)为大型语言模型（LLM）的微调提供了一种有效而高效的解决方案。LoRA的模块化和即插即用的特性使得能够集成各种领域特定的LoRA，以增强LLM的能力。先前的研究要么专注于特定的隔离下游任务，要么在训练过程中固定LoRA的选择。然而，在实际情况中，LLM接收到涵盖不同任务的各种提示，并且候选LoRA的池经常动态更新。为了弥合这一差距，我们提出了LoraRetriever，一种根据输入提示自适应检索和合成多个LoRA的框架。LoraRetriever包含三个主要组成部分：首先，识别和检索与给定输入相关的LoRA；其次，制定有效整合检索到的LoRA的策略；最后，开发高效的方法用于实现LoRA的合成。",
