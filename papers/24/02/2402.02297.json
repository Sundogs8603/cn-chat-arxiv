    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种基于去噪扩散概率模型（DDPMs）的新方法，用于控制非线性动力系统。DDPMs是目前生成模型中的最先进技术，在各种采样任务中取得了成功。在我们的框架中，我们将反馈控制问题视为在控制系统约束下从目标集合中绘制样本的生成任务。DDPMs的正向过程通过添加噪声构建从目标集合起始的轨迹。我们学习如何反向控制动力系统，使得终止状态属于目标集合。对于没有漂移的控制仿射系统，我们证明了当可控性的李括号条件成立时，控制系统能够完全追踪正向过程的轨迹。我们在各种非线性系统上进行了数值研究，并验证了我们的理论结果。我们还在一个物理学实验案例中进行了超出理论结果的数值实验。",
