More recently, distortion-free watermarking methods were proposed that require a secret key to detect the watermark. The prior methods generally embed zero-bit watermarks that do not provide additional information beyond tagging a text as being AI-generated. We extend an existing zero-bit distortion-free watermarking method by embedding multiple bits of meta-information as part of the watermark.

    "translated_abstract": "曾提出水印大型语言模型的方法，通过稍微改变模型输出分布来区分AI生成的文本和人类生成的文本，但它们也会扭曲文本的质量，从而将水印暴露给对抗性检测。最近提出了无失真水印方法，需要一个秘钥来检测水印。之前的方法通常嵌入零比特水印，除了标记文本为AI生成外并未提供额外信息。我们通过嵌入多比特的元信息作为水印的一部分，扩展了现有的零比特无失真水印方法。我们还开发了一个计算高效的解码器，从水印中提取嵌入的信息，具有很低的比特误码率。",
