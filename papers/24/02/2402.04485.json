    "translated_abstract": "为了提高联邦赌博学习的效率和实用性，最近的研究引入了激励机制来促使客户之间的通信，其中一个客户只有在服务器提供的激励超过其参与成本时才参与。然而，现有的激励机制天真地假设客户是真实的，即他们都报告自己的真实成本，因此参与成本更高的客户声称的越高，服务器必须支付的越多。因此，这种机制容易受到希望通过错误报告来优化自己效用的策略性客户的攻击。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种激励兼容（即真实）的通信协议，名为Truth-FedBan，其中每个参与者的激励与其自报成本无关，而报告真实成本是实现最佳效用的唯一方式。更重要的是，Truth-FedBan仍能保证亚线性的遗憾和通信成本，而无需任何额外开销。换句话说，核心解决了客户之间的激励问题，从而提高了联邦赌博学习的效率和实用性。",
