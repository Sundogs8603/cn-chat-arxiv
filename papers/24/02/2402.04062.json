    "translated_abstract": "对于使用知识图谱进行链接预测已经进行了深入的研究，导致了具有成功应用的图神经网络体系结构的丰富景观。然而，将这些体系结构的成功转移到使用关系超图进行链接预测仍然具有挑战性。关系超边的存在使得链接预测成为在不同选择的k个节点之间的任务，这比使用知识图谱进行链接预测要困难得多，因为每个关系都是二进制的（k=2）。在本文中，我们提出了两个使用关系超图进行链接预测的框架，并通过相应的关系Weisfeiler-Leman算法以及一些自然逻辑形式对生成的模型体系结构的表达能力进行了彻底分析。通过广泛的实证分析，我们验证了提出的模型体系结构在各种关系超图基准测试上的能力。",
