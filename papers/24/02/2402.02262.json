    "translated_abstract": "自杀仍然是全球健康领域的一个关注焦点，急需创新方法进行早期检测和干预。本文着重于识别SuicideWatch Reddit帖子中的自杀意图，并提出了一种使用尖端的RoBERTa-CNN模型进行自杀检测的新方法，RoBERTa-CNN是RoBERTa（鲁棒性优化BERT方法）的一种变体。RoBERTa被用于各种自然语言处理（NLP）任务，包括文本分类和情感分析。RoBERTa的有效性在于它能够捕捉文本信息并形成文本之间的语义关系。通过在原始模型中添加卷积神经网络（CNN）层，RoBERTa增强了从庞大数据集中捕捉重要模式的能力。我们在自杀和抑郁检测数据集上评估了RoBERTa-CNN，并获得了可靠的结果，例如，RoBERTa-CNN在平均准确率上获得了98％，标准差为...",
