    "translated_abstract": "人类移动行为与交通拥堵、疫情控制等重要社会问题密切相关。然而，收集移动性数据成本高昂且涉及严重的隐私问题，迫切需要高质量的生成性移动模型。先前的研究主要集中在从训练样本中学习行为分布，并通过采样学习到的分布生成新的移动数据。然而，它们不能有效地捕捉驱动移动行为的连贯意图，导致样本效率和语义感知度低。受到LLMs中新兴的推理能力的启发，我们提出了一种根本的视角转变，将移动生成重新定义为常识推理问题。在本文中，我们设计了一种新颖的移动生成推理（MobiGeaR）框架，促使LLMs递归生成移动行为。具体而言，我们设计了一个上下文感知的推理机制。",
