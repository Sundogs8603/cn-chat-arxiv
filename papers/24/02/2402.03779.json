    "translated_abstract": "先进的机器学习模型的不断复杂化要求创新的方法来有效管理计算资源。其中一种方法是早期退出策略，通过提供缩短简单数据实例处理路径的机制，实现自适应计算。在本文中，我们提出了EERO，一种将早期退出问题转化为使用具有拒绝选项的多个分类器问题的新方法，以便更好地选择每个实例的退出头。我们使用指数权重聚合来校准不同头部退出的概率，以保证一个固定的预算。我们考虑贝叶斯风险、预算约束和头部特定预算消耗等因素。通过在Cifar和ImageNet数据集上使用ResNet-18模型和ConvNext架构进行的实验结果表明，我们的方法不仅能有效管理预算分配，还能提高过度考虑场景中的准确性。",
