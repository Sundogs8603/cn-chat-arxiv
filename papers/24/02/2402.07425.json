    "abstract": "Global popularity (GP) bias is the phenomenon that popular items are recommended much more frequently than they should be, which goes against the goal of providing personalized recommendations and harms user experience and recommendation accuracy. Many methods have been proposed to reduce GP bias but they fail to notice the fundamental problem of GP, i.e., it considers popularity from a \\textit{global} perspective of \\textit{all users} and uses a single set of popular items, and thus cannot capture the interests of individual users. As such, we propose a user-aware version of item popularity named \\textit{personal popularity} (PP), which identifies different popular items for each user by considering the users that share similar interests. As PP models the preferences of individual users, it naturally helps to produce personalized recommendations and mitigate GP bias. To integrate PP into recommendation, we design a general \\textit{personal popularity aware counterfactual} (PPAC) frame",

    "translated_abstract": "全球流行度（GP）偏见是指推荐系统在推荐物品时普遍偏向热门物品，这违背了提供个性化推荐的目标，对用户体验和推荐准确性造成了不利影响。许多方法已经被提出来减少GP偏见，但它们没有注意到GP的根本问题，即它从全局的角度考虑热门度，使用一组热门物品，因此无法捕捉到个别用户的兴趣。因此，我们提出了一种以用户为基础的物品流行度称为个人流行度（PP），通过考虑分享相似兴趣的用户来为每个用户识别不同的热门物品。由于PP模型化了个体用户的偏好，它自然可以帮助生成个性化的推荐并减少GP偏见。为了将PP融入推荐中，我们设计了一个通用的个人流行度感知反事实（PPAC）框架。",
