    "abstract": "We propose a novel framework that leverages LLMs for full causal graph discovery. While previous LLM-based methods have used a pairwise query approach, this requires a quadratic number of queries which quickly becomes impractical for larger causal graphs. In contrast, the proposed framework uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach which allows it to use only a linear number of queries. We also show that the proposed method can easily incorporate observational data when available, to improve performance. In addition to being more time and data-efficient, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world causal graphs of varying sizes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in discovering causal relationships, showcasing its potential for broad applicability in causal graph discovery tasks across different domains.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一个新的框架，利用LLMs进行完整的因果图发现。之前基于LLM的方法采用了成对查询的方法，但这需要二次查询的数量，对于较大的因果图来说很快变得不可行。相反，提出的框架采用了广度优先搜索（BFS）的方法，只需要线性数量的查询。我们还展示了当有所观察数据可用时，提出的方法可以轻松地进行结合以提高性能。除了更具时间和数据效率外，提出的框架在不同大小的真实因果图上取得了最先进的结果。结果证明了提出方法在发现因果关系方面的有效性和效率，展示了其在不同领域的因果图发现任务中的广泛适用性潜力。",
