    "translated_abstract": "近来，图数据上的持续学习因旨在解决现有任务上的灾难性遗忘问题以及将顺序更新的模型适应新出现的图任务而引起了极大关注。虽然人们努力总结了在欧几里得数据（例如图像和文本）上持续学习研究的进展，但对于图上的持续学习，即持续图学习（CGL）或终身图学习，仍然需要进行系统性审查。图数据在数据结构和应用场景方面要复杂得多，这使得CGL任务设置、模型设计和应用变得极具挑战性。为了弥合差距，我们通过阐明不同的任务设置并根据特性对现有的持续图学习（CGL）算法进行分类，提供了对现有持续图学习（CGL）算法的全面评估。我们将CGL方法与传统的持续学习方法进行比较。",
