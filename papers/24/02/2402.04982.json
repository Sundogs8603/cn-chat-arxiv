    "translated_abstract": "本论文提出了一种将可解释的人工智能（XAI）技术与自适应学习相结合的方法，以增强能耗预测模型，在处理数据分布转移方面具有重要意义。利用SHAP聚类，我们的方法提供了可解释的模型预测解释，并利用这些洞察力来自适应地改进模型，平衡模型复杂性和预测性能。我们介绍了一个三阶段的过程：（1）获取SHAP值来解释模型预测，（2）对SHAP值进行聚类以识别不同的模式和异常值，（3）根据得到的SHAP聚类特征来改进模型。我们的方法可以减轻过拟合，确保处理数据分布转移的鲁棒性。我们使用一个包含建筑物能耗记录的全面数据集进行评估，以及另外两个数据集来评估我们的方法在其他领域、回归和分类中的可迁移性。",
