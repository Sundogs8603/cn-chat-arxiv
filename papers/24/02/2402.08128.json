In this paper, we study an interaction between AI agents where the agents run a recursive joint simulation. That is, the agents first jointly observe a simulation of the situation they face.

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能(AI)代理之间的博弈动态与传统的人-人互动可能存在各种不同之处。其中一个区别是可能能够准确地模拟AI代理，例如因为其源代码是已知的。我们的目标是探索利用这种可能性在战略设置中实现更合作的结果的方法。在本文中，我们研究了AI代理之间运行递归协同模拟的互动。即，代理首先共同观察他们所面对情境的模拟。这种模拟反过来递归地包括了额外的模拟（为了避免无限递归，具有小概率的失败），并且在选择行动之前观察所有这些嵌套模拟的结果。我们证明，由此产生的互动在战略上等价于原始游戏的无限重复版本，从而可以直接转移诸如各种民间定理等现有结果。",
