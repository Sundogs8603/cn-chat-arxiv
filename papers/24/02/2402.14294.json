In this theory, hypotheses are either graphs, hypergraphs or, more generally, structures in finite relational languages, and i.i.d. sampling is replaced by sampling an induced substructure, producing an exchangeable distribution. We prove a high-arity version of the fundamental theorem of statistical learning by characterizing high-arity (agnostic) PAC learnability in terms of finiteness of a purely combinatorial dimension and in terms of an appropriate version of uniform convergence.",
