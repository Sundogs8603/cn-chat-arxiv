    "translated_abstract": "我们表征了非负短期利率R的仿射期限结构模型，这些模型可以作为由独立的一维Lévy鞅驱动的自主性随机微分方程的解得到，即形如$$dR(r)=F(R(t))dt+\\sum_{i=1}^{d}G_i(R(t-))dZ_i(t), \\quad R(0)=r_0\\geq 0, \\quad t>0, \\quad (1)$$的方程，其中$F,G_1,...,G_d$是确定性实函数，$Z_1,...,Z_d$是独立的一维Lévy鞅。利用Filipović关于仿射期限结构模型生成器形式的一般结果，我们证明了在驱动噪声的拉普拉斯变换是正则变化的假设下，所有可能的(1)的解$R$也可以作为由驱动稳定过程的解的自主性随机微分方程得到，稳定指数范围为$(1,2]$。获得的模型特别包括由Jiao等人引入的$\\alpha$-CIR模型，该模型证明比经典的CIR模型更简单且更可靠。",
