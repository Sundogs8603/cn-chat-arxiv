    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.09286v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Objective: Firearm injury research necessitates using data from often-exploited vulnerable populations of Black and Brown Americans. In order to minimize distrust, this study provides a framework for establishing AI trust and transparency with the general population. Methods: We propose a Model Facts template that is easily extendable and decomposes accuracy and demographics into standardized and minimally complex values. This framework allows general users to assess the validity and biases of a model without diving into technical model documentation. Examples: We apply the Model Facts template on two previously published models, a violence risk identification model and a suicide risk prediction model. We demonstrate the ease of accessing the appropriate information when the data is structured appropriately. Discussion: The Model Facts template is limited in its current form to human based data and biases. Like nutrition facts, it also wi",
