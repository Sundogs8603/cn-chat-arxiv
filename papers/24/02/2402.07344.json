    "abstract": "Scheduling laboratory tests for ICU patients presents a significant challenge. Studies show that 20-40% of lab tests ordered in the ICU are redundant and could be eliminated without compromising patient safety. Prior work has leveraged offline reinforcement learning (Offline-RL) to find optimal policies for ordering lab tests based on patient information. However, new ICU patient datasets have since been released, and various advancements have been made in Offline-RL methods. In this study, we first introduce a preprocessing pipeline for the newly-released MIMIC-IV dataset geared toward time-series tasks. We then explore the efficacy of state-of-the-art Offline-RL methods in identifying better policies for ICU patient lab test scheduling. Besides assessing methodological performance, we also discuss the overall suitability and practicality of using Offline-RL frameworks for scheduling laboratory tests in ICU settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "ICU病人的实验室检测排程是一个重要挑战。研究表明，在ICU中下达的实验室检测约有20-40%是多余的，可以在不妨碍患者安全的情况下消除。先前的研究利用离线强化学习（Offline-RL）基于患者信息找到了最佳的实验室检测排程策略。然而，自那时以来已经发布了新的ICU病人数据集，并且离线强化学习方法也取得了各种进展。在本研究中，我们首先介绍了针对时间序列任务的新发布的MIMIC-IV数据集的预处理流程。然后，我们探索了最先进的离线强化学习方法在识别更好的ICU病人实验室检测排程策略方面的功效。除了评估方法的性能，我们还讨论了在ICU环境中使用离线强化学习框架进行实验室检测排程的总体适用性和实用性。",
