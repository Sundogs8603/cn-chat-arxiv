To address these limitations, we propose Syflow, an end-to-end optimizable approach in which we leverage normalizing flows to model arbitrary target distributions, and introduce a novel neural layer that results in easily interpretable subgroup descriptions.

    "translated_abstract": "找到并描述相对于目标属性异常的子群在许多科学领域具有重要应用，从在人口普查数据中识别处于劣势的人口群体到在金纳米粒子中找到有导电性的分子。当前找到这样的子群的方法需要预先离散化的预测变量，不允许非平凡目标分布，不适用于大型数据集，并且难以找到多样性结果。为解决这些限制，我们提出了Syflow，这是一种端到端可优化的方法，在这种方法中，我们利用正规化流来建模任意目标分布，并引入了一种新颖的神经层，可以产生易于解释的子群描述。我们在合成和真实数据上进行了演示，包括一个案例研究，表明Syflow可可靠地找到伴随着有见地的描述的高度异常子群。",
