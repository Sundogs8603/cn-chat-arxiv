    "translated_abstract": "AI赋能的合成生物学具有巨大的潜力，但也显著增加了生物风险，并带来了一系列新的双重使用问题。鉴于将新兴技术相结合，AI赋能的合成生物学潜在地将生物工程扩大到工业生物制造之中，这一局面变得复杂。然而，文献综述表明，如维持合理的创新范围，或者更有野心地培育巨大的生物经济并不一定与生物安全相对立，而是需要相辅相成。本文对相关问题进行了文献综述，并描述了横跨命令与控制、管护、自底向上和自由放任治理选择的政策和实践新兴框架。如何实现早期预警系统，以便预防和减轻AI赋能的生物危害，包括来自实验室、恶意滥用或公共领域，将不断需要探索。",
    "tldr": "本文综述了AI赋能的合成生物学面临的治理挑战，提出了新兴框架，结合创新和生物安全的共同目标，探讨了命令与控制、管护、自底向上和自由放任等治理选择。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a literature review of the challenges in governing AI-enabled synthetic biology and proposes emerging frameworks that balance innovation and biosafety. It explores governance options such as command-and-control, stewardship, bottom-up, and laissez-faire to address the dual use concerns and risks associated with scaling up bioengineering into industrial biomanufacturing."
