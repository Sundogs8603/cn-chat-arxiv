We revisit the definition of bias by discovering new bias types (e.g., societal status) in dynamic environments and describe them relative to context, such as culture, region, time, and personal background. Our framework includes eight hypotheses about bias and a minimizing bias strategy for each assumption as well as five methods as proposed solutions in LLM. The realization of the framework is yet to be completed.",
