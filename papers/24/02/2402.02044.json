    "translated_abstract": "在大量向量集合中找到与给定查询最相似的向量嵌入一直是无数实际应用的关键组成部分。最近引入的检索增强生成就是其中最突出的例子之一。对于许多这些应用，数据库通过插入新数据和删除过时数据而随时间演变。在这些情况下，检索问题被称为流式相似度搜索。虽然局部自适应向量量化（LVQ）作为一种高效的向量压缩方法，在非演化数据库中具有最先进的搜索性能，但其在流式场景中的实用性尚未确定。在这项工作中，我们研究了LVQ在流式相似度搜索中的应用。为了支持我们的评估，我们引入了两种LVQ的改进：Turbo LVQ和multi-means LVQ，分别提升了其搜索性能高达28%和27%。我们的研究表明，LVQ及其新变体使得向量搜索变得极快。",
