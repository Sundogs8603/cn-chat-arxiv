    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）的崛起已经彻底改变了许多行业，并改变了社会的运作方式。其广泛使用导致了AI和其底层数据在许多智能系统中的分布。在这种情况下，利用分布式或由不同实体拥有的学习过程中的信息至关重要。因此，现代数据驱动的服务已经开发出将分布式知识实体整合到其结果中的方法。为了实现这个目标，最新的AI模型经常被以分散式的方式进行训练。分布式学习涉及多个实体共同进行预测和决策。然而，这种合作也可能带来安全漏洞和挑战。本文提供了关于分布式学习中的私人知识共享的深入调查，考察了在领先的分布式学习架构中使用的各种知识组件。我们的分析揭示了解决这些挑战的现有方法和未来的研究方向。",
