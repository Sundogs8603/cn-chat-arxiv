    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLM）中参数域知识的增加深度推动它们在现实世界应用中的快速部署。在高风险和知识密集型任务中，理解模型的漏洞对于量化模型预测的可信度和规范其使用至关重要。最近发现在自然语言处理任务中作为对抗示例的命名实体引发了关于它们在其他环境中可能的伪装的疑问。在这里，我们提出了一种在嵌入空间中的幂缩放距离加权采样方案，以发现多样化的对抗实体作为干扰因素。我们展示了它在生物医学主题的对抗性问题回答中优于随机采样的优势。我们的方法使得可以探索攻击表面上的不同区域，这揭示了两种在特征上明显不同的对抗性实体的制度。此外，我们展示了攻击方式如何...",
