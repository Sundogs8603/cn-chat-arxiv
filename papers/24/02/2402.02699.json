    "translated_abstract": "数据增强（DA）由于其易于实现和显著的有效性，在深度说话人模型中广泛受到欢迎。它通过模拟真实的声学变化来丰富训练数据，使深度神经网络能够学习与说话人相关的表示，同时忽略不相关的声学变化，从而提高鲁棒性和泛化性。然而，普通的DA存在一个潜在问题，即增强残差，即不同类型的增强引起的不必要失真。为了解决这个问题，本文提出了一种称为对抗性数据增强（A-DA）的新方法，该方法结合了DA和对抗性学习。具体而言，它涉及一个额外的增强分类器来分类用于数据增强的各种增强类型。这种对抗性学习使网络能够生成可以欺骗增强分类器的说话人嵌入，从而使学习到的说话人嵌入在面对不同类型增强时更具鲁棒性。",
