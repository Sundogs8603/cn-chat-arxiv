Conformal prediction helps decision-makers quantify outcome uncertainty for actions, allowing for better risk management.

Our procedure can be applied post-hoc to any black-box predictor to provide rigorous, action-specific decision-making guarantees. Numerical experiments show our approach strikes a balance between interval efficiency and conditional validity.",

    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习指导下的决策中，决策者通常在具有相同预测结果的情境中采取相同的行动。符合预测帮助决策者量化动作的结果不确定性，从而实现更好的风险管理。受这种观点的启发，我们引入了自洽的符合预测，它产生了既符合Venn-Abers校准的预测，又符合以模型预测引发的动作为条件的符合预测区间。我们的方法可以后验地应用于任何黑盒预测器，提供严格的、针对具体动作的决策保证。数值实验表明，我们的方法在区间的效率和条件的有效性之间达到了平衡。",
