    "translated_abstract": "将离散和连续数据相结合对于生成模型来说是一项重要的能力。我们提出了离散流模型（DFMs），这是一种新的基于流的离散数据模型，可以实现将基于流的生成模型应用于多模态连续和离散数据问题。我们的关键见解是，离散空间流匹配的离散等效可以通过使用连续时间马尔可夫链来实现。DFMs通过简单的推导包括离散扩散模型作为特定实例，同时允许在现有基于扩散的方法上改进性能。我们利用DFMs方法构建了一个多模态基于流的建模框架。我们将此能力应用于蛋白质共设计的任务，其中我们学习了一个能够同时生成蛋白质结构和序列的模型。我们的方法在共设计性能上达到了最先进水平，同时允许使用同一个多模态模型进行序列或结构的灵活生成。",
