    "translated_abstract": "本文侧重于科学任务的自主应急规划，通过在出现延迟或偏离正常任务计划时，从状态空间中任何非正常点进行快速策略计算。成功的应急规划涉及在随机情景中管理风险和回报，通常与行动概率相关。马尔可夫决策过程（MDPs）用于在此类情景中进行数学建模决策。然而，在行星漫游车穿越规划的特定情况下，庞大的行动空间和长期规划时间跨度带来了计算挑战。提出了一个双层MDP框架来提高计算的可解性，同时与现有任务规划实践保持一致，增强基于人工智能的解决方案的可解释性和可信度。我们讨论了将任务规划MDP转换为双层MDP，并在RoverGridWorld上测试了框架。",
