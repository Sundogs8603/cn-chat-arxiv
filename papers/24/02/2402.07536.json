    "translated_abstract": "交易区间突破（TRB）是金融交易技术分析中的一种关键方法，广泛应用于股票、期货和外汇等金融市场的交易者。然而，区分真假突破并提供正确的理由对投资者来说具有重要挑战。最近，大型语言模型在各种下游应用中取得了成功，但在金融突破检测领域的效果仍不理想。原因在于突破检测需要独特的数据和特定的知识。为了解决这些问题，我们引入了BreakGPT，这是第一个用于金融突破检测的大型语言模型。此外，我们还开发了一种名为多阶段结构的新颖框架，有效地减少了下游应用中的错误。实验结果表明，与GPT-3.5相比，BreakGPT的答案和理由的准确性提高了44%，有助于金融突破检测。",
