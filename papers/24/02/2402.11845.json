    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们解决了在低资源环境中检测仇恨模因的挑战，该环境下只有少量标记示例可用。我们的方法利用了广泛使用的参数高效调整技术低秩适应（LoRA）的组合性。我们首先在选择的与仇恨模因检测相关的任务上利用LoRA微调大型语言模型（LLMs），从而生成一套LoRA模块。这些模块具有对于仇恨模因检测的基本推理能力。然后，我们使用少量可用的标记样本来训练一个模块组合器，它根据模块的相关性分配权重给LoRA模块。模型的可学习参数与LoRA模块的数量成正比。这种由LLMs支撑并且增强了LoRA模块的模块化网络，在仇恨模因检测的情境中表现出增强的泛化能力。我们的评估涵盖了三个设计的数据集。",
