    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种名为sDBSCAN的算法，在高维空间中使用余弦距离进行可扩展的密度聚类。通过利用随机投影的保邻特性，sDBSCAN能够快速识别核心点及其邻域，这是密度聚类的主要障碍。在理论上，sDBSCAN在较轻的条件下以高概率输出类似于DBSCAN的聚类结构。为了进一步促进sDBSCAN，我们提出了sOPTICS，这是一种用于交互式探索内在聚类结构的可扩展OPTICS。我们还通过随机核特征将sDBSCAN和sOPTICS扩展到L2、L1、$\\chi^2$和Jensen-Shannon距离。在实证方面，sDBSCAN在真实世界的百万数据集上比许多其他聚类算法显著更快，并提供更高的准确性。在这些数据集上，sDBSCAN和sOPTICS在几分钟内运行，而scikit-learn的对应算法需要数小时或由于内存不足而无法运行。",
