    "translated_abstract": "在图上的分布转移——即训练和测试图机器学习模型之间的数据分布差异，往往普遍且在现实场景中不可避免。这种转移可能严重恶化模型的性能，给可靠的图机器学习带来重大挑战。因此，图图像的Out-Of-Distribution（OOD）适应方法的研究激增，其旨在减轻分布转移，并将一个分布的知识适应到另一个分布。 在我们的调查中，我们提供了图OOD适应方法的最新和前瞻性回顾，涵盖两个主要问题场景，包括训练时和测试时的图OOD适应。 我们首先正式描述了这两个问题，然后讨论了图上的不同类型的分布转移。基于我们对图OOD适应的提出的分类法，我们系统地对现有的方法进行分类。",
