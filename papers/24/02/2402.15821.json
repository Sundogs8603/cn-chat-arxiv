    "translated_abstract": "许多涉及人类和机器的感兴趣的场景 - 从虚拟个人助理到自动驾驶车辆 - 可以自然地建模为委托人（人类）委托给代理人（机器），这些代理人之后代表他们的委托人相互交互。我们将这些多委托人，多代理人的情况称为委托游戏。在这类游戏中，存在两种重要的失败模式：控制问题（代理人未能按照其委托人的偏好行事）和合作问题（代理人未能良好地协作）。在本文中，我们形式化和分析这些问题，进一步将其解释为对齐（参与者是否具有相似的偏好？）和能力（参与者在满足这些偏好方面的能力如何？）的问题。我们理论上和经验上展示了这些措施如何确定委托人的福利，如何可以使用有限的观察来估计这些措施，",
