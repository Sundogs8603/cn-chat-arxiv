    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了一种名为Permute-and-Flip（PF）解码器的新解码方法。它具有与标准采样解码器相似的鲁棒性特性，但在质量和鲁棒性的 tradeoff 上证明比采样方法更好，且永远不会差于任何其他解码器。同时，我们还设计了一种类似于Aaronson的Gumbel水印的加密水印方案，但是针对PF解码器而自然量身定制。该水印方案不改变样本的分布，同时允许任意低的假阳性率和高的召回率，只要生成的文本具有高熵。我们的实验证明，PF解码器（及其带有水印的对应物）在困惑度方面明显优于朴素采样（及其带有Gumbel水印的对应物），同时保持相同的鲁棒性（和可检测性），因此为LLM解码提供了一个有希望的新方法。代码可在https://github.com/XuandongZhao/pf-decoding找到。",

    "en_tdlr": "A new decoding method called Permute-and-Flip (PF) decoder is proposed, which has an optimal tradeoff between robustness and quality. The PF decoder outperforms sampling methods and is never worse than any other decoder. Additionally, a watermarking scheme tailored for PF decoder is designed, maintaining the sample distribution and allowing low false positive rate and high recall. Experimental results show that the PF decoder significantly improves perplexity compared to naive sampling, making it a promising approach for LLM decoding."
