    "translated_abstract": "双层优化处理嵌套问题，在这些问题中，领导者首先做出决策以最小化自己的目标函数，同时考虑到追随者的最好反应。整数变量约束的双层问题特别难以处理。尽管已经提出了用于混合整数线性双层优化的精确求解器，但它们在问题规模较大时往往无法扩展，并且难以推广到非线性情况。另一方面，问题特定的算法（精确和启发式）局限于特定范围。在以数据驱动的环境下，我们提出的框架Neur2BiLO将通过监督回归训练的领导者或追随者的值函数的神经网络近似嵌入到易于解决的混合整数规划中。 Neur2BiLO作为一种启发式算法，可以快速生成高质量的解决方案，适用于双层背包拦截问题，即“关键n个问题”。",
