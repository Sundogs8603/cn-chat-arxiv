We analyse studies from the biomedical, as well as the psychological domain, but also from the NLP domain in order to find linguistic, prosodic and acoustic cues that could indicate autism. Our survey looks at all three domains. We define autism and which comorbidities might influence the correct detection of the disorder. We especially look at observations such as verbal and semantic fluency, prosodic features, but also disfluencies and speaking rate. We also show word-based approaches and describe machine learning and transformer-based approaches both on the audio data as well as the transcripts. Lastly, we conclude, while there already is a lot of research, female patients seem to be severely under-researched.

    "translated_abstract": "研究范围涵盖了自闭症在声音、语言和言语中的表现。我们分析了来自生物医学、心理学领域以及自然语言处理领域的研究，以找出可能指示自闭症的语言、韵律和声学线索。我们的调查涵盖了这三个领域。我们定义了自闭症，以及可能影响正确检测该疾病的共病症。我们特别关注了词汇和语义流利性、韵律特征，以及不连贯性和说话速度等观察结果。我们还展示了基于单词的方法，并描述了在音频数据和文本转录上都使用的基于机器学习和变压器的方法。最后，我们得出结论，尽管已经有很多研究，但女性患者似乎受到严重的研究不足。此外，大多数自然语言处理研究都集中在传统的机器学习方法上，而不是变压器，在这方面可能是有益的。",
