We identify such dynamics from the data using localised regressions and build a model that significantly improves volatility forecasts. Such forecasting models, based on a rich persistence structure that varies smoothly over time, outperform state-of-the-art benchmark models and are particularly useful for forecasting over longer horizons.",

    "translated_abstract": "时间变动和持续性是波动性的关键属性，通常在基于石油的波动性预测模型中分别研究。在这里，我们提出了一种新的方法，允许具有异质持续性的冲击在时间上平滑变化，并将两者结合在一起建模。我们认为这很重要，因为这种动态是由于基于石油商品的冲击的动态性质自然产生的。我们通过局部回归从数据中识别出这种动态，并建立了一个显著改进波动性预测的模型。这种基于在时间上平滑变化的丰富持续性结构的预测模型，超越了最先进的基准模型，并在较长的预测时间段内特别有用。",
