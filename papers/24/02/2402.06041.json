    "translated_abstract": "避免偏见和不适当的二元假设的性别中立翻译（GNT）是创造更包容性翻译技术的一个关键挑战。然而，机器翻译（MT）在此任务上的进展受到了无专用平行数据的限制，这些数据对于调整MT系统以满足中立约束是必要的。在这种情况下，大型语言模型提供了迄今为止未曾预见到的可能性，因为它们具有在提供明确指示时在各种（子）任务中灵活性的独特优势。在本文中，我们通过将MT与流行的GPT-4模型进行比较，探索了自动化GNT的潜力。通过广泛的手工分析，我们的研究从实证角度揭示了现有MT系统在生成GNT方面的固有局限性，并为提示中立性所带来的潜力和挑战提供了宝贵的见解。",
