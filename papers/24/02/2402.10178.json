    "translated_abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs)如ChatGPT的出现，启发了基于LLM的代理的开发，能够解决复杂的实际问题。然而，这些代理在执行任务时常常由于方法论约束（如错误传播和适应性受限）而遇到困难。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于动态任务分解和代理生成的多代理框架(TDAG)。该框架动态地将复杂任务分解为更小的子任务，并将每个子任务分配给一个特别生成的子代理，从而提高了在多样化和不可预测的实际任务中的适应性。同时，现有的基准测试往往缺乏评估复杂、多步骤任务中递增进展所需的细粒度。为了应对这个问题，我们在旅行规划的背景下引入了ItineraryBench，它具有互连、逐渐复杂的任务和细粒度的评估系统。",
