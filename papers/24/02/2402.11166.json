    "translated_abstract": "Multi-hop QA (MHQA)涉及逐步推理以回答复杂问题并找到多个相关支持事实。然而，现有大型语言模型在多跳问题回答中的推理能力仍然不足，无法满足多跳问题的回答需求。此外，尚不清楚LLMs是否按照期望的推理链来达到正确的最终答案。在本文中，我们提出了一种从可解释QA的角度提高LLMs推理能力的生成式问题分解方法（GenDec），通过根据额外提取的证据生成独立完整的子问题。为了展示Gendec的影响、泛化性和稳健性，我们进行了两个实验，首先是将GenDec与小型QA系统结合在段落检索和QA任务上。其次，我们检查了各种最先进的LLM的推理能力。",
