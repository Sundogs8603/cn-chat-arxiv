    "translated_abstract": "多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）最近展示了在回答视觉问题方面引人注目的感知能力，然而，对它们感知能力的限制知之甚少。特别是，在先前的研究中，虽然提供了MLLMs对物体大小敏感的个别证据，但这一现象及其潜在原因尚未得到全面探究。在本研究中，我们定量研究了几个最先进的MLLMs对小型视觉对象的感知，并揭示了它们在回答与小型对象有关的问题时普遍存在的限制。接下来，我们确定了四个独立因素，它们可能导致这种限制，包括物体质量、大小、干扰物和位置，并进行了控制性干预研究，以评估每个因素对MLLMs感知能力的影响。特别是，我们发现低质量的物体和更小的物体大小都可以独立降低MLLMs回答视觉问题的能力。更令人惊讶的是，我们发现物体位置对MLLMs的感知能力也有影响。",
