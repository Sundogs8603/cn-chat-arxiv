    "translated_abstract": "考虑到将球状物体定位到超出直接触及范围的目标区域这一任务，人类通常会投掷、滑动或将物体反弹到墙上以实现目标。然而，让机器人进行类似推理是非常困难的。现有的物理推理方法需要大量数据，并且在真实世界中固有的复杂性和不确定性方面存在困难。本文提出了PhyPlan，一种新颖的物理信息化规划框架，将物理信息化神经网络（PINNs）与改进的蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）相结合，以使具有身体的代理能够执行动态物理任务。PhyPlan利用PINNs以快速准确地模拟和预测动作的结果，并使用MCTS进行规划。它动态确定是要咨询基于PINN的模拟器（粗糙但快速）还是直接与实际环境互动（精细但缓慢）以确定最佳策略。在模拟的3D环境中进行了机器人评估。",
