    "translated_abstract": "工业级推荐系统通常包含检索阶段和排名阶段，以处理亿级用户和物品。检索阶段用于检索与用户兴趣相关的候选物品进行推荐，引起了广泛关注。经常情况下，用户展示出层次化的多个兴趣，比如一个在体育中热衷支持金州勇士队的用户，也会对几乎所有动画有兴趣，体育和动画处于同样的层次。然而，大多数现有方法隐式地学习这种层次化差异，导致更细粒度的兴趣信息被平均化，限制了对用户在热门兴趣和其他轻兴趣方面的详细理解。因此，在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的两阶段方法，用于显式地建模层次化多兴趣的推荐系统。在第一阶段，我们使用层次聚类和基于Transformer的模型来挖掘层次化的多兴趣信息。",
