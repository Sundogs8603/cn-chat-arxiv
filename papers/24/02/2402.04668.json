    "translated_abstract": "全球疾病负担不断增加，针对在临床试验中人数不足的患者群体，治疗效果不平等。然而，医疗以医疗治疗的平均人群效应为驱动力，因此采取了“一刀切”的方法，不一定适合每个患者。这些事实表明，急需方法学研究个体化治疗效果（ITE）以推动个人化治疗。尽管机器学习驱动的ITE估计模型引起了越来越大的兴趣，但绝大多数仅关注具有有限回顾和理解的表格数据，针对时间序列电子病历（EHR）提出的方法尚未深入研究。为此，本研究概述了针对时间序列数据的ITE研究工作，并针对未来的研究提出了见解。该工作总结了文献中的最新工作，并从理论假设、治疗设置类型和计算框架的角度进行了评述。",
