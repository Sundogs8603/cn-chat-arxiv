In practice, TSLS is severely biased when saturation leads to a number of control dummies that is of the same order of magnitude as the sample size, and the use of many, arguably weak, instruments. This paper derives asymptotically valid tests and confidence intervals for an estimand that identifies the weighted average of LATEs targeted by saturated TSLS, even when the number of control dummies and instrument interactions is large.

    "translated_abstract": "在理论上，两阶段最小二乘法（TSLS）能够从饱和规范中识别协变量特定的局部平均处理效应（LATEs）的加权平均，而不对可用协变量进入模型的参数做出假设。在实践中，当饱和导致控制虚拟变量的数量与样本量的数量级相同时，以及使用许多、可以说是弱的工具时，TSLS严重偏倚。本文针对识别目标为饱和TSLS定位的LATEs加权平均的估值，提出了渐近有效的测试和置信区间，即使控制虚拟变量和工具交互作用的数量很大。所提出的推断程序对于饱和经济数据的四个关键特征具有鲁棒性：处理效应异质性、具有丰富支持的协变量、弱识别强度以及条件异方差性。",
