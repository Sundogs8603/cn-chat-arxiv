Different forms of the latent AR bandit appear in many real-world settings, especially in emerging scientific fields such as behavioral health or education where there are few mechanistic models of the environment. If the AR order $k$ is known, we propose an algorithm that achieves $\\tilde{O}(k\\sqrt{T})$ regret in this setting.

    "translated_abstract": "本文考虑具有非平稳奖励的随机多臂赌博机问题。我们提出了一个新颖的非平稳环境的公式，其中臂的平均奖励随时间变化是由一些未知的潜在自回归(AR)状态的顺序k决定的。我们将这个新的环境称为潜在AR赌博机。潜在AR赌博机的不同形式在许多现实世界的场景中都出现，特别是在行为健康或教育等新兴科学领域中，这里缺乏对环境的机制建模。如果AR顺序k已知，我们提出了一个算法，在这种情况下，算法表现出O(k√T)的遗憾率。实证结果显示，即使k被错误地估计，我们的算法在多个非平稳环境中也胜过标准的UCB算法。",
