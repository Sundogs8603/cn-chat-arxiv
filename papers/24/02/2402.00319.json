    "abstract": "Visual storytelling aims to automatically generate a coherent story based on a given image sequence. Unlike tasks like image captioning, visual stories should contain factual descriptions, worldviews, and human social commonsense to put disjointed elements together to form a coherent and engaging human-writeable story. However, most models mainly focus on applying factual information and using taxonomic/lexical external knowledge when attempting to create stories. This paper introduces SCO-VIST, a framework representing the image sequence as a graph with objects and relations that includes human action motivation and its social interaction commonsense knowledge. SCO-VIST then takes this graph representing plot points and creates bridges between plot points with semantic and occurrence-based edge weights. This weighted story graph produces the storyline in a sequence of events using Floyd-Warshall's algorithm. Our proposed framework produces stories superior across multiple metrics in t",

    "translated_abstract": "视觉故事创作旨在根据给定的图像序列自动生成一个连贯的故事。与图像描述任务不同，视觉故事应包含事实描述、世界观和人类社交常识，将零散的元素组合成一个连贯而引人入胜的人工编写故事。然而，大多数模型主要侧重于应用事实信息和使用分类/词汇外部知识来创建故事。本文介绍了SCO-VIST，一种将图像序列表示为对象和关系的图形框架，包括人类行为动机及其社交互动常识知识。SCO-VIST然后将这个表示情节点的图形与语义和基于事件发生的边缘权重之间建立桥梁。这个加权故事图使用Floyd-Warshall算法以事件序列形式产生故事情节。我们提出的框架在多个指标上产生出色的故事。",
