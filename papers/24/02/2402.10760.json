Many existing prediction approaches focus on single-point predictions, lacking the depth needed for effective decision-making and often overlooking market risk. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel model, RAGIC, which introduces sequence generation for stock interval prediction to quantify uncertainty more effectively. Our approach leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to produce future price sequences infused with randomness inherent in financial markets.

    "translated_abstract": "预测股市结果的努力取得了有限的成功，这是由市场固有的随机特性受许多不可预测因素影响造成的。许多现有的预测方法侧重于单点预测，缺乏有效决策所需的深度，经常忽视市场风险。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了一种新颖的模型RAGIC，引入序列生成用于股票区间预测，更有效地量化不确定性。我们的方法利用生成对抗网络（GAN）生成未来价格序列，注入金融市场固有的随机性。RAGIC的生成器包括一个风险模块，捕捉熟悉投资者的风险感知，以及一个时间模块，考虑历史价格趋势和季节性。这个多方面的生成器通过统计推断呈现风险敏感区间的创建，融入时间",
