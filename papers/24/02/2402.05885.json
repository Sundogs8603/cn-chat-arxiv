    "translated_abstract": "在生物学、化学、推荐系统和社交网络分析等领域，需要识别与查询图结构距离较小的图形。在多种测量图间距离的方法中，图编辑距离（GED）因其可理解性而被认为是首选，但其计算的NP难度限制了其应用。目前最先进的GED近似方法主要采用神经方法，然而，这些方法（i）缺少与近似的GED对应的解释性编辑路径；（ii）需要通过NP难问题生成ground-truth GED进行训练；（iii）需要在每个数据集上进行独立训练。本文提出了一种高效的代数无监督方法EUGENE，它近似计算GED并生成与近似成本对应的编辑路径，同时消除了生成ground-truth和数据特定训练的需求。广泛的实验评估表明，EUGENE的上述优点并不以效力为代价。",
