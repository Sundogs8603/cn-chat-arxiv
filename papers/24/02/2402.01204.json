    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习（SSL）已经被应用于各个领域的许多最先进的模型中，其中SSL通过定义基于无标签数据集的预训练任务来学习上下文化和鲁棒的表示。最近，SSL已成为探索表格数据领域中表示学习能力的新趋势，这是一项更具挑战性的任务，因为它没有明确的关系来学习描述性的表示。本调研旨在系统地回顾和总结自监督学习在非连续表格数据（SSL4NS-TD）中的最新进展和挑战。首先，我们给出了NS-TD的正式定义，并阐明了它与相关研究的关联。然后，这些方法被分为三组——预测性学习、对比学习和混合学习，并介绍了每个方向的代表性方法的动机和优点。在此基础上，还介绍了SSL4NS-TD的应用问题，包括自动化数据工程、跨表格查询和隐私保护等。",
