    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.18825v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is a challenging subtask of multi-label classification due to its complex taxonomic structure. Nearly all recent HTC works focus on how the labels are structured but ignore the sub-structure of ground-truth labels according to each input text which contains fruitful label co-occurrence information. In this work, we introduce this local hierarchy with an adversarial framework. We propose a HiAdv framework that can fit in nearly all HTC models and optimize them with the local hierarchy as auxiliary information. We test on two typical HTC models and find that HiAdv is effective in all scenarios and is adept at dealing with complex taxonomic hierarchies. Further experiments demonstrate that the promotion of our framework indeed comes from the local hierarchy and the local hierarchy is beneficial for rare classes which have insufficient training data.",

    "translated_abstract": "分层文本分类（HTC）是多标签分类的一个具有挑战性的子任务，因为其复杂的分类结构。几乎所有最近的HTC作品都关注标签如何结构化，但忽略了根据每个输入文本的地面真实标签的子结构，其中包含丰富的标签共现信息。在这项工作中，我们引入了这种本地层次结构和一个对抗性框架。我们提出了一个名为HiAdv的框架，可以适应几乎所有HTC模型，并将本地层次结构作为辅助信息进行优化。我们在两个典型的HTC模型上进行测试，并发现HiAdv在所有情况下都是有效的，能够处理复杂的分类层次结构。进一步的实验证明，我们框架的提升确实来自本地层次结构，本地层次结构有利于那些训练数据不足的罕见类别。",
