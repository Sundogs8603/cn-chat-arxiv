    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了Sandra，这是一个将矢量表示与演绎推理相结合的神经符号推理器。Sandra使用本体论建立了一个受限的向量空间，并在其中进行推理。推理器的几何特性使得它能够与神经网络结合起来，弥合了符号知识表达与神经网络之间的差距。Sandra基于描述和情境(DnS)本体设计模式，它是一种框架语义的形式化。给定一组事实(情境)，它能够推断出所有可能的透视图(描述)，为其提供一个合理的解释，即使在信息不完整的情况下也能做到。我们证明了我们的方法在DnS模型上是正确的。我们对两个不同任务及其标准基准进行了实验，证明了Sandra不增加复杂性的情况下：(i)优于所有基准线；(ii) 在分类过程中提供可解释性；(iii)对向量空间具有可控性。",
