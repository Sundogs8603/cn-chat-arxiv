    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce Multiple Embedding Model for EHR (MEME), an approach that views Electronic Health Records (EHR) as multimodal data. This approach incorporates \"pseudo-notes\", textual representations of tabular EHR concepts such as diagnoses and medications, and allows us to effectively employ Large Language Models (LLMs) for EHR representation. This framework also adopts a multimodal approach, embedding each EHR modality separately. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MEME by applying it to several tasks within the Emergency Department across multiple hospital systems. Our findings show that MEME surpasses the performance of both single modality embedding methods and traditional machine learning approaches. However, we also observe notable limitations in generalizability across hospital institutions for all tested models.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们引入了针对电子健康记录（EHR）的多重嵌入模型（MEME），这种方法将EHR视为多模态数据。该方法包括“伪笔记”，即对表格形式的EHR概念（如诊断和药物）进行文本表示，使我们能够有效地使用大型语言模型（LLM）进行EHR表示。该框架还采用了多模态方法，分别嵌入每个EHR模态。我们通过在多个医院系统的急诊科中应用MEME来证明其有效性。我们的研究结果表明，MEME在性能上超过了单模态嵌入方法和传统的机器学习方法。然而，我们还观察到所有测试模型在不同医院机构之间的泛化能力方面存在明显的局限性。",
