    "translated_abstract": "对于在线社交网络（OSNs）来说，自动化账户（也称为“社交机器人”）的检测已经成为一个日益重要的问题。尽管已经提出了几种方法来检测社交机器人，但仍存在显著的研究空白。首先，当前模型在检测旨在模仿真实OSN用户的复杂机器人方面存在局限性。其次，这些方法往往依赖于容易受到操纵的简易个人资料特征。除了易受到对抗性操纵的脆弱性外，这些模型缺乏泛化性，导致在一个数据集上训练，又在另一个数据集上进行测试时性能不佳。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种基于自监督对比学习的社交机器人检测的新框架（BotSSCL）。我们的框架利用对比学习在嵌入空间中区分社交机器人和人类，从而提高线性可分性。BotSSCL产生的高级表示增强了其鲁棒性。",
