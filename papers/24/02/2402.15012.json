In recent years, text-to-SQL has made significant progress, but most were English-centric. In this paper, we introduce Ar-Spider 1, the first Arabic cross-domain text-to-SQL dataset. Due to the unique nature of the language, two major challenges have been encountered, namely schema linguistic and SQL structural challenges. In order to handle these issues and conduct the experiments, we adopt two baseline models LGESQL [4] and S2SQL [12], both of which are tested with two cross-lingual models to alleviate the effects of schema linguistic and SQL structure linking challenges. The baselines demonstrate decent single-language performance on our Arabic text-to-SQL dataset, Ar-Spider, achieving 62.48% for S2SQL and 65.57% for LGESQL, only 8.79% below the",

    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言处理（NLP）中，文本到SQL语义解析是最重要的任务之一，它旨在使用户以更自然的方式与数据库进行交互。近年来，文本到SQL已取得重大进展，但大多数是以英语为中心的。本文介绍了第一个阿拉伯跨领域文本到SQL数据集Ar-Spider。由于该语言的独特性质，我们遇到了两个主要挑战，即模式语言和SQL 结构挑战。为了处理这些问题并进行实验，我们采用了两个基线模型LGESQL和S2SQL，两者均与两个跨语言模型进行了测试，以减轻模式语言和SQL结构链接挑战的影响。基线模型在我们的阿拉伯文本到SQL数据集Ar-Spider上表现出不错的单语言性能，其中S2SQL实现了62.48%，LGESQL实现了65.57%，仅低于8.79%。",
