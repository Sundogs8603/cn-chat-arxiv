    "translated_abstract": "领域随机化是一种有效的计算机视觉技术，用于提高视觉模型在视觉上截然不同但内容相似的领域中的传递性。然而，现有的方法大量依赖于调整复杂和专门的仿真引擎，这些引擎的构建很困难，进而影响了它们的可行性和可扩展性。本文介绍了BehAVE，一种视频理解框架，它独特地利用现有的商业视频游戏来实现领域随机化，而无需访问它们的仿真引擎。在BehAVE下，(1) 视频游戏固有的丰富视觉多样性成为随机化的来源，(2) 玩家行为 - 通过动作的文本描述进行语义表示 - 引导具有相似内容的视频的对齐。我们在各种视频和文本基础模型上测试了BehAVE，并报告了它在领域随机化方面的鲁棒性。",
