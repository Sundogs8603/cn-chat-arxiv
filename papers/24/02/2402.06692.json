To this end, we propose a simple and effective method, HistoHDR-Net, to recover the fine details (e.g., color, contrast, saturation, and brightness) of HDR images via a fusion-based approach utilizing histogram-equalized LDR images along with self-attention guidance. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach over the state-of-art methods.",

    "translated_abstract": "高动态范围（HDR）成像旨在复制真实场景的高视觉质量和清晰度。由于HDR成像的高成本，文献中提出了各种数据驱动方法用于从低动态范围（LDR）图像重构HDR图像。这些方法的一个常见限制是在重构的HDR图像中缺失的细节，这些细节在输入的LDR图像中过曝或曝光不足。为此，我们提出了一种简单而有效的方法HistoHDR-Net，通过融合基于直方图均衡的LDR图像和自注意力引导，恢复HDR图像的细节（例如颜色，对比度，饱和度和亮度）。我们的实验证明了该方法在现有方法上的有效性。",
