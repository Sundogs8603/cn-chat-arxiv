    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）容易受到越狱攻击的影响，越狱攻击通过微妙地修改攻击查询来提取有害信息。随着防御机制的进化，越狱攻击直接获取有害信息变得越来越具有挑战性。本研究受到人类间接引出有害信息的实践启发，针对一种新的攻击形式——上下文交互攻击。该方法依赖于LLMs生成过程中的自回归性质。我们认为先前的上下文——攻击查询之前的信息在实现强大的越狱攻击方面起着关键作用。具体而言，我们提出了一种利用初步问答对与LLMs交互的方法。通过这样做，我们引导模型的回答朝着揭示“期望的”有害信息的方向发展。我们在四种不同的LLMs上进行了实验证明了方法的有效性。",
