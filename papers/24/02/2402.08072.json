    "abstract": "Generative AI is changing the way that many disciplines are taught, including computer science. Researchers have shown that generative AI tools are capable of solving programming problems, writing extensive blocks of code, and explaining complex code in simple terms. Particular promise has been shown in using generative AI to enhance programming error messages. Both students and instructors have complained for decades that these messages are often cryptic and difficult to understand. Yet recent work has shown that students make fewer repeated errors when enhanced via GPT-4. We extend this work by implementing feedback from ChatGPT for all programs submitted to our automated assessment tool, Athene, providing help for compiler, run-time, and logic errors. Our results indicate that adding generative AI to an automated assessment tool does not necessarily make it better and that design of the interface matters greatly to the usability of the feedback that GPT-4 provided.",

    "translated_abstract": "生成式人工智能正在改变许多学科的教学方式，包括计算机科学。研究人员已经表明，生成式人工智能工具能够解决编程问题、编写大量代码块，并以简单的术语解释复杂的代码。在使用生成式人工智能增强编程错误信息方面显示出了特别的潜力。学生和教师多年来一直抱怨这些信息往往晦涩难懂。然而最近的研究表明，通过GPT-4改进的消息使学生的错误次数减少。我们通过将ChatGPT的反馈添加到我们的自动化评估工具Athene中，为所有提交的程序提供对编译器、运行时和逻辑错误的帮助，对这项工作进行了扩展。我们的结果表明，向自动化评估工具添加生成式人工智能并不一定使其变得更好，接口的设计对GPT-4提供的反馈的可用性有重大影响。",
