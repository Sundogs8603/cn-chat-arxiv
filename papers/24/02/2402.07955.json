    "translated_abstract": "蛋白质功能注释是生物学中重要但具有挑战性的任务。最近的深度学习进展显示，通过学习蛋白质序列和结构，可以显著提高准确的功能预测能力。然而，这些基于预测器的方法通常忽视了蛋白质相似性建模，这是在传统方法中使用序列或结构检索工具常用的思想。为了填补这个差距，我们首先通过在蛋白质功能注释任务上对比检索器和预测器进行基准测试，研究了蛋白质相似性建模的影响。我们的结果表明，检索器可以在没有大规模预训练的情况下与或胜过预测器。基于这些见解，我们引入了一种新颖的变分伪似然框架ProtIR，旨在通过整合蛋白质相似性建模来改进功能预测器。该框架在功能预测器和检索器之间迭代地优化知识，从而结合了两者的优势。",
