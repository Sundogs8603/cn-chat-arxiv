Various deep neural network models have been employed to address this challenge, but their black-box nature hinders transparency and debugging capabilities in a deployed system. Glass-box models offer a solution by providing full interpretability through methods like \\ac{GAM}. In this study, we evaluate an efficient additive model called \\ac{EBM} for traffic prediction on three popular mixed traffic datasets: \\ac{SDD}, \\ac{InD}, and Argoverse. Our results show that the \\ac{EBM} models perform competitively in predicting pedestrian destinations within \\ac{SDD} and \\ac{InD} while providing modest predictions for vehicle-dominant Argoverse dataset. Additionally, our transparent trained models allow us to analyse feature importance and interactions, as well as provide qualitative examples of predictions explanation. The full training code will be made public upon publication.",

    "translated_abstract": "开发精确的交通轨迹预测模型对于实现完全自动驾驶至关重要。各种深度神经网络模型已被应用于解决此挑战，但它们的黑盒特性限制了在部署系统中的透明度和调试能力。玻璃盒模型通过类似于GAM的方法提供了全面的可解释性。在本研究中，我们评估了一种高效的可加性模型，称为EBM，用于三个流行的混合交通数据集（SDD、InD和Argoverse）的交通预测。我们的结果显示EBM模型在预测SDD和InD中的行人目的地时具有竞争力，同时对以车辆为主的Argoverse数据集提供了适度的预测。此外，我们透明的训练模型使我们能够分析特征的重要性和相互作用，并提供预测解释的质量示例。全面的训练代码将在论文发表后公开。",
