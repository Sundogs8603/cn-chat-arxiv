    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱(KG)已经成为表示大规模链接数据的常见方法。然而，由于KG的巨大规模，图谱学习系统需要帮助人类进行分析、解释和模式检测。尽管有许多KG学习系统对研究人员和临床医生进行了赋能，但我们发现现有的图谱学习中存在四个关键不足，这些不足同时限制了KG学习的性能并降低了人类与这些学习系统的最佳接口能力。这些不足包括：1)缺乏专家知识的整合，2)对KG中节点度数极端性的不稳定性，3)在学习过程中缺乏对不确定性和相关性的考虑，4)缺乏可解释性。此外，我们对解决每个问题的现有尝试进行了分类，并指出每个尝试在很大程度上与解决其他问题的尝试相隔离。通过对这些问题的形式化，",
