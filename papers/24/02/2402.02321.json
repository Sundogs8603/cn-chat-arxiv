    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNN）在节点分类等任务中取得了显著的成功，这很大程度上依赖于足够标记的节点的可用性。然而，标记大规模图的巨大成本使得人们将重点放在了图上的主动学习上，该方法旨在通过有效的数据选择来最大化下游模型的性能。值得注意的是，大多数现有方法都假设了可靠的图拓扑，而实际情况下往往会出现有噪声的图。鉴于此，设计一个成功的适用于有噪声图的主动学习框架是非常必要但具有挑战性的，因为选择标记数据和获取干净的图是两个相互依赖的任务：选择高质量的数据需要干净的图结构，而清理噪声图结构需要足够标记的数据。考虑到上述复杂性，我们提出了一个主动学习框架GALClean，该框架专门设计成采用迭代方法来进行数据选择和图的清理。",
