    "translated_abstract": "生成式AI为人们在日常任务中提供了新颖而令人印象深刻的能力。有许多AI工作流程通过将AI输出与人类互动相结合来解决真实而复杂的问题。尽管AI具有无可否认的吸引力，但在新鲜感消失后，生成式AI工作流程的实用性如何仍然不确定。此外，利用生成式AI构建的工具具有个性化和快速适应的潜力，但用户是否充分利用了个性化的可能性呢？我们进行了一项为期三周的纵向研究，共有12个用户，旨在了解科学传播中生成式AI工具的熟悉度和定制化程度。我们的研究发现，熟悉化阶段持续了4.3个会话，用户在这个阶段探索工作流程的功能以及他们发现哪些方面有用。在熟悉化后，系统的感知效用评分高于之前，表明了感知效用的提高。",
