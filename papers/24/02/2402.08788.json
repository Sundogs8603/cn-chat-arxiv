    "translated_abstract": "本文报道了我们在构建一个基于音节的粤语语音转文本系统方面的工作。这是为了帮助患有写作技巧认知缺陷但表达能力没有问题的诵读障碍学生构建一个语音转文本系统的努力的一部分。对于粤语语音识别，声学模型的基本单位可以是传统的字符为基础的音节（Initial-Final，IF）或者进一步将尾音拆分为韵核和辅音以反映粤语音节内变体的韵脚核心韵臼（Onset-Nucleus-Coda，ONC）音节。通过使用Kaldi工具包，我们的系统使用随机梯度下降优化模型进行训练，辅以GPU进行混合深度神经网络和隐马尔可夫模型（DNN-HMM）的训练，以及基于I矢量的说话人自适应训练技术。相同的高斯混合模型在训练DNN的说话人自适应训练（GMM-SAT）中用作输入特征。",
