The chosen principle involves modeling the solution ranks of the 3-SAT problem, which, in this particular case, directly represent a solution. This results in a highly compact circuit with few gates, enabling the modeling of large-sized 3-SAT problems. Numerical experimentation demonstrates that the approach can solve instances composed of 91 clauses and 20 variables with an implementation based on Qiskit.",
