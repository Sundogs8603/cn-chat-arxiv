    "translated_abstract": "在应用聚类算法时，选择聚类数是关键步骤之一。为了完成这个任务，引入了各种聚类有效性指数（CVIs）。大多数聚类有效性指数都被定义为检测数据集中隐藏的最优聚类数。然而，用户有时并不期望获得最优聚类数，而是更适合他们应用的次优聚类数。这促使我们引入了一种基于现有基础指数的贝叶斯聚类有效性指数（BCVI）。该指数基于狄利克雷或广义狄利克雷先验定义，得到相同的后验分布。然后我们基于Wiroonsri指数（WI）和Wiroonsri-Preedasawakul指数（WP）作为硬聚类和软聚类的基础指数来测试我们的BCVI。我们将它们的结果与原始的基础指数以及一些其他存在的CVIs（包括Davies and Bouldin (DB)，Starczewski (STR)）进行比较。",
