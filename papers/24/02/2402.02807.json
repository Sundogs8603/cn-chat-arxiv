    "abstract": "In traditional studies on language evolution, scholars often emphasize the importance of sound laws and sound correspondences for phylogenetic inference of language family trees.

Building on (a) ten diverse datasets from different language families, and (b) state-of-the-art methods for automated cognate and sound correspondence detection, we test, for the first time, the performance of sound-based versus cognate-based approaches to phylogenetic reconstruction.

    "translated_abstract": "在传统的语言进化研究中，学者们通常强调声音规律和对应关系对于语言家族谱系推断的重要性。然而，迄今为止，计算方法往往没有充分考虑到这一潜力。大多数计算方法仍然依赖于词汇同源作为语言学系统发育重建的主要数据来源，尽管也有一些研究中的作者赞赏比较声音序列的好处。基于十个来自不同语言家族的多样数据集和现代自动同源和声音对应检测方法，我们首次测试了基于声音和基于同源的方法在系统发育重建中的性能。结果表明，通过词汇同源重建的谱系在广义四元组距离上与真实谱系平均更接近，提升了约三分之一。",
