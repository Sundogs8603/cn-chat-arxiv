To this end, various works on this topic, published since 2015, were selected and analyzed. From this analysis, it was possible to categorize the main topics discussed in the papers into five groups: (i) the impacts of a low-cost airline on competing airlines; (ii) impacts on airports; (iii) general impacts on the demand for air transport; (iv) effects on passengers' choice process; and (v) general effects on a geographical region.",
