    "translated_abstract": "如果找不到证据，生物医学索赔验证将失败。在这些情况下，事实核查结果未知，索赔无法验证。为了改进这一情况，我们需要了解是否有任何索赔属性会影响其可验证性。在这项工作中，我们假设实体和关系定义了生物医学索赔解剖学的核心变量，并分析它们的属性是否有助于区分可验证和不可验证的索赔。在与经过训练的注释专家进行的研究中，我们要求他们找到生物医学索赔的证据，并观察他们如何改进证据搜索的查询。这导致了第一个用主题-关系-客体三元组、证据文档和事实核查结果（BEAR-Fact语料库）进行科学事实验证的语料库。我们发现（1）发现否定性索赔的证据（例如，X不导致Y）特别具有挑战性。此外，我们发现注释者主要通过添加来处理查询。",
