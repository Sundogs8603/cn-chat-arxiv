    "translated_abstract": "为了提高大型语言模型(LLMs)处理复杂推理问题的能力，提出了思维链(Chain-of-Thoughts, CoT)方法，用于指导LLMs进行逐步推理，从简单到复杂的问题解决。目前最先进的生成这种思维链的方法涉及互动协作，学习者生成候选中间思维，由LLMs评估，引导生成后续思维。然而，一个广泛但未被充分研究的问题是，LLMs的评估通常存在噪声和不可靠性，可能误导生成过程，选择不够有潜力的中间思维。本文受Vapnik原则的启发，提出了一种新的基于比较的CoT生成算法，直接根据LLMs的噪声反馈确定最有潜力的思维。在每一轮中，我们随机配对中间思维，并直接促使LLMs从每对中选择更有潜力的思维。",
