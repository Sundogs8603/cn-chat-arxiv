    "translated_abstract": "数据驱动模型在工业领域的快速增长得益于传感器技术的普及，使得大量数据的收集成为可能。然而，在故障检测和预测方面利用这些模型面临着诸多挑战，包括缺失值和类别不平衡等问题。此外，工业运营中的成本敏感性进一步增加了在这个背景下应用传统模型的复杂性。本文介绍了一种新颖的成本敏感变压器模型，它是作为一个系统工作流的一部分开发的，还整合了混合重采样器和基于回归的插补器。通过对来自Scania卡车的APS故障数据集和SECOM数据集的严格测试，我们观察到与最先进方法相比性能有了显著提升。此外，我们进行了剔除实验来分析我们提出的方法中不同组件的贡献。",
