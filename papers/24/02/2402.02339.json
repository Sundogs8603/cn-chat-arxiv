    "translated_abstract": "尽管数据驱动方法在3D人体姿势估计方面取得了成功，但它们常常受到域间差异的限制，表现出有限的泛化能力。相比之下，基于优化的方法在特定情况下进行微调方面表现优秀，但整体表现通常不如数据驱动方法。我们观察到先前的基于优化的方法通常依赖于投影约束，这仅仅确保了在2D空间中的对齐，可能导致过拟合问题。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种不确定性感知的测试时间优化 (UAO) 框架，它保留了预训练模型的先验信息，并利用关节点的不确定性来缓解过拟合问题。具体而言，在训练阶段，我们设计了一个有效的2D到3D网络，用于估计相应的3D姿势，并量化每个3D关节点的不确定性。对于测试时的优化，所提出的优化框架冻结预训练模型，并仅优化少量关键参数，以提高性能。",
