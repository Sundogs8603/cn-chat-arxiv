    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.08430v1 公告类型：交叉 生成型人工智能正在改变开发者与软件系统的交互方式，提供能够产生和传递新内容的服务，以满足开发者的实际需求。例如，开发者可以通过编写自然语言提示在其IDE中直接请求新代码，基于生成型人工智能的集成服务，如Copilot，会立即通过提供即可使用的代码片段来响应提示。恰当地编写提示，并在避免信息过载的同时融入有用信息，对于获取正确的代码片段可能是一个重要因素。设计好的提示的任务被称为提示工程。在本文中，我们系统地研究了八个提示特征对生成的代码的样式和内容、正确性、复杂性、大小和与开发者代码的相似性的影响。",
