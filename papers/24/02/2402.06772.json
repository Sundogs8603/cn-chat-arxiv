    "translated_abstract": "在有机合成中，从指定的核心产物预测反应物是一个基本的挑战，被称为逆向合成预测。最近，基于半模板和基于图编辑的方法在解释性和准确性方面取得了良好的表现。然而，由于它们的机制，这些方法无法预测复杂的反应，例如具有多个反应中心或将相同离开基团连接到多个原子的反应。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于半模板的方法，即逆向合成通过(超)图搜索(RetroSiG)框架，以减轻这些限制。在所提出的方法中，我们将反应中心的识别和离开基团的完成任务转化为在产物分子图中搜索和在离开基团超图中搜索的任务。作为一种基于半模板的方法，RetroSiG具有几个优点。首先，RetroSiG能够处理提到的复杂反应。",
