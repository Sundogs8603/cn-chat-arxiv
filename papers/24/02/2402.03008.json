    "translated_abstract": "传统马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）方法在多模态分布的混合不足方面存在着挑战，特别是在贝叶斯推断和分子动力学等实际应用中。针对这个问题，我们提出了一种创新的采样方法——扩散吉布斯采样（DiGS），用于有效采样具有远程和断开模态特征的分布。DiGS集成了扩散模型的最新发展，利用高斯卷积创建一个辅助噪声分布，以在原始空间中连接孤立的模态，并应用吉布斯采样从两个空间中交替抽取样本。我们的方法在采样多模态分布方面表现出比并行温度法等最先进方法更好的混合性能。我们证明我们的采样器在各种任务中取得了显著改进的结果，包括高斯混合模型、贝叶斯神经网络和分子动力学。",
