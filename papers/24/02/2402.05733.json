    "translated_abstract": "尽管通过大规模语言模型（LLM）模拟人类行为取得了显著进展，但当前的文本模拟在时间概念上仍然不足。为此，我们介绍了TimeArena，一个新颖的文本模拟环境，它融入了复杂的时间动态和约束，更好地反映了现实生活中的计划场景。在TimeArena中，代理被要求尽快完成多个任务，允许并行处理以节省时间。我们实现了动作之间的依赖关系、每个动作的时间持续和代理及环境中的对象的占有情况。TimeArena基于烹饪、家庭活动和实验室工作中的30个真实任务。我们使用TimeArena对各种最先进的LLM模型进行了大量实验证明，即使是最强大的模型，如GPT-4，在有效的多任务处理方面仍然落后于人类，凸显了改进时间感知的需要。",
