IVON's computational costs are nearly identical to Adam but its predictive uncertainty is better. We show several new use cases of IVON where we improve fine-tuning and model merging in Large Language Models, accurately predict generalization error, and faithfully estimate sensitivity to data.

    "translated_abstract": "我们提供了大量实证证据，反驳了变分学习对大型神经网络无效的普遍看法。我们展示了一种名为Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON)的优化器，在训练大型网络（如GPT-2和ResNets）时始终能够与Adam相匹配或胜过它。IVON的计算成本几乎与Adam相同，但其预测不确定性更好。我们展示了IVON的几种新用例，其中我们改进了大型语言模型的微调和模型合并，在准确预测泛化误差和忠实估计对数据的敏感性方面。我们找到了大量支持变分学习有效性的证据。",
    "tldr": "变分学习在大型深度网络中展现出非常好的效果，IVON优化器在训练大型网络时几乎能与Adam相媲美甚至胜过它，且预测不确定性更准确，对模型微调、泛化误差预测和数据敏感性估计均有显著改进。",
    "en_tdlr": "Variational learning shows great effectiveness for large deep networks, with the IVON optimizer matching or outperforming Adam in training large networks, providing more accurate predictive uncertainty, and significantly improving model fine-tuning, generalization error prediction, and sensitivity estimation to data."
