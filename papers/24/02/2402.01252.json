    "translated_abstract": "这项研究的出发点是预测气象站的空气污染物含量。空气污染物取决于站点的位置（天气条件和周围活动）。在学习过程中经常忽略周围环境信息。在没有观测到的天气条件下，这些信息事先是已知的，并且对于同一个站点保持不变。将周围环境信息视为附加信息有助于在新站点中预测污染物，从而导致了零射回归场景。目前在零射问题中存在的方法通常偏向于分类，而且很难推广至回归问题。本文提出了两种用于回归的零射方法。第一种方法是基于相似性的方法，它从特征学习模型，并使用附加信息对它们进行汇总。然而，在汇总过程中可能会丢失特征模型的潜在知识。第二种方法则是一种集成学习的方法，它结合了特征模型和附加信息。",
