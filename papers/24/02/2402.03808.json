    "translated_abstract": "当被监测的肌肉靠近心脏时，表面肌电图（sEMG）记录可能受到心电图（ECG）信号的影响。一些现有方法使用基于信号处理的方法，如高通滤波器和模板减法，而一些方法则通过求取映射函数从带有ECG干扰的sEMG（噪声sEMG）中恢复出干净的sEMG信号。最近引入了一种著名的生成模型，即基于得分的扩散模型，用于通过噪声输入数据生成高质量和准确的样本。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，称为SDEMG，用作sEMG信号去噪的基于得分的扩散模型。为了评估所提出的SDEMG方法，我们使用来自开放接源的Non-Invasive Adaptive Prosthetics数据库的数据以及来自MIT-BIH Normal Sinus Rhythm数据库的ECG信号进行了降噪实验。实验结果表明，SDEMG胜过了比较方法。",
