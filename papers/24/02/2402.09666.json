    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.09666v1 公告类型：新的 摘要：常识知识图完成是常识知识图构建和应用的新挑战。与Freebase和YAGO等事实性知识图不同，常识知识图（如ConceptNet）利用自由形式的文本来表示命名实体、短语和事件作为它们的节点。这种松散的结构导致了大型稀疏的常识知识图，使得对这些节点的语义理解对学习丰富的常识知识图嵌入更为关键。当前的方法利用语义相似性增加图的密度，但节点及其关系的语义合理性尚未充分探索。以前的工作采用概念抽象来改善建模（事件）合理性的一致性，但它们不够可扩展且仍然受到数据稀疏性的影响。在本文中，我们提出采用文本蕴涵来寻找隐含的蕴涵关系。",
