    "translated_abstract": "文本情绪分类是一个具有挑战性和主观性的任务，由于需要进行认知推论过程来解释文字刺激。此外，情绪类别集合高度依赖于特定领域。例如，文学分析可能需要使用审美情感（例如，发现某物美丽），而社交媒体分析则可以从细粒度的集合中获取好处（例如，将愤怒与烦恼分开），与基本情绪类别相对应。这使得该任务成为了零-shot分类的一个有趣领域，在这种分类中，模型开发时不知道标签集合。不幸的是，大多数情绪分析资源都是英文的，因此，情绪分析的大部分研究都是用英文进行的，包括那些涉及使用提示语言模型的研究。这给我们留下一个研究空白，我们在本文中探讨：在非英文文本中，我们应该用哪种语言提示情绪标签？",
