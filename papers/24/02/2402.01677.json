    "translated_abstract": "本体包含领域内丰富的知识，可以分为两个类别，即外延知识和内涵知识。外延知识提供关于本体中特定概念所属的具体实例的信息，而内涵知识详细描述了概念之间的内在属性、特征和语义关联。然而，现有的本体嵌入方法未能同时充分考虑外延知识和内涵知识。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为EIKE（Extensional and Intensional Knowledge Embedding）的新型本体嵌入方法，通过在外延空间和内涵空间中表示本体。EIKE提出了一个统一的框架，用于将实例、概念及其关系嵌入到本体中，采用基于几何的方法对外延知识进行建模，并使用预训练的语言模型对内涵知识进行建模。",
