    "translated_abstract": "在基于模型的强化学习中，大多数算法依赖于从数据学到的单步动力学模型模拟轨迹。这种方法的一个关键挑战是随着轨迹长度的增加，单步预测误差的累积问题。本文通过使用多步目标来训练单步模型来解决这个问题。我们的目标是在不同的未来时间点上加权平均的均方误差(MSE)损失函数。我们发现，这种新的损失函数在数据存在噪声的情况下特别有用（观测上的加性高斯噪声），而这种情况在现实环境中经常出现。为了支持多步损失函数，首先我们在两种可处理的情况下研究了它的性质：i）一维线性系统，和ii）两参数非线性系统。其次，我们在各种任务（环境或数据集）中展示了使用这种损失函数训练的模型在未来预测中的平均R2得分方面取得了显著的改善。",

This loss function is particularly effective in the presence of noise and has been demonstrated to improve prediction performance in various tasks."
