    "translated_abstract": "维度约减（DR）技术，如t-SNE和UMAP，很受欢迎，可以将复杂的数据集转换成更简单的可视化表示。然而，虽然这些方法有效地揭示了数据集的总体模式，但可能会引入伪像并存在解释性问题。本文提出了一种名为DimVis的可视化工具，它使用监督的可解释性提升机器（EBM）模型（在用户选择的感兴趣数据上训练）作为DR投影的解释助手。我们的工具通过通过交互式探索UMAP投影中的特征相关性来提供对视觉聚类中特征重要性的解释，从而促进高维数据分析。具体而言，DimVis使用一个对比的EBM模型，该模型在实时训练中能区分感兴趣聚类内外的数据。利用EBM固有的可解释性，我们可以通过单个和成对的特征比较来解释聚类本身。",
