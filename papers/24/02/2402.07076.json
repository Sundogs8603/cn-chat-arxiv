    "translated_abstract": "云解决方案在技术行业中非常受欢迎，因为它们提供了一系列服务和工具来解决特定问题。然而，尽管它们被广泛使用，但解决方案提供商的销售团队仍然面临一个复杂的业务问题，即找到适合特定目标解决方案的合适的公司客户，现有的匹配系统尚未能够充分解决这个问题。在这项工作中，我们研究了B2B解决方案匹配问题，并确定了该场景的两个主要挑战：(1) 复杂多领域特征的建模和(2) 有限、不完整和稀疏的交易数据。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一个框架CAMA，它以分层多领域匹配结构为主干，并通过三种数据增强策略和对比预训练目标来弥补可用数据的不完善之处。通过对一个真实数据集进行大量实验，我们证明了...",
