Unlike the DAI, Generative AI (GenAI) pertains to generative models (GMs) capable of discerning the underlying data distribution, patterns, and features of the input data. This makes GenAI a crucial asset in wireless domain wherein real-world data is often scarce, incomplete, costly to acquire, and hard to model or comprehend. With these appealing attributes, GenAI can replace or supplement DAI methods in various capacities. Accordingly, this combined tutorial-survey paper commences with preliminaries of 6G and wireless intelligence by outlining candidate 6G applications and services, presenting a taxonomy of state-of-the-art DAI models, exemplifying prominent DAI use cases, and elucidating the multifaceted ways through which GenAI enhances DAI.

    "translated_abstract": "大多数基于数据驱动的无线研究严重依赖于需要大量真实世界数据集的判别式人工智能（DAI）。与DAI不同，生成式人工智能（GenAI）涉及能够识别输入数据的潜在数据分布、模式和特征的生成模型（GMs）。这使得GenAI在无线领域成为一个关键资产，其中真实世界数据通常稀缺、不完整、获取成本高，难以建模或理解。有了这些吸引人的特征，GenAI可以取代或补充DAI方法的各种能力。因此，这篇结合了教程和调研的论文从6G和无线智能的基础开始，通过概述候选6G应用和服务、提出现代DAI模型的分类法、举例说明著名的DAI用例，并阐明GenAI如何增强DAI的多方面方式。接着，我们通过重点介绍开创性的GMs来呈现一个GMs的教程。",
