    "abstract": "We conducted a detailed analysis on the quality of web-mined corpora for two low-resource languages (making three language pairs, English-Sinhala, English-Tamil and Sinhala-Tamil). We ranked each corpus according to a similarity measure and carried out an intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation on different portions of this ranked corpus. We show that there are significant quality differences between different portions of web-mined corpora and that the quality varies across languages and datasets. We also show that, for some web-mined datasets, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models trained with their highest-ranked 25k portion can be on par with human-curated datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们对两种低资源语言（英文-僧伽罗语，英文-泰米尔语和僧伽罗语-泰米尔语）的网络挖掘语料库的质量进行了详细分析。我们根据相似度标准对每个语料库进行了排名，并对排名语料库的不同部分进行内在和外在评估。我们显示不同部分的网络挖掘语料库存在显著的质量差异，并且质量在不同语言和数据集之间存在变化。我们还表明，对于某些网络挖掘数据集，使用其排名最高的25k部分训练的神经机器翻译（NMT）模型可以与人工策划的数据集持平。",
