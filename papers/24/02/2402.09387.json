    "translated_abstract": "托卡马克提供了一条实现聚变能源的有希望的途径，但是等离子体非正常放电会带来重大的经济风险，因此对非正常放电的避免进行了相当多的研究。本研究通过训练一个策略，使其能够在避免与非正常放电相关的多个量的限制的同时安全地降低等离子体电流。策略训练环境是一个混合物理学和机器学习模型，该模型基于SPARC主要参考放电(PRlD)降放过程的模拟进行训练，这是一个即将到来且具有燃烧等离子体的实验性情景，我们将其用作测试平台。为了应对物理不确定性和模型的不准确性，在策略训练期间，模拟环境使用GPU进行大规模并行处理，并采用随机化的物理参数。经过训练的策略随后成功地转移到高准确度的模拟器中，在避免用户指定的破坏性限制的同时，成功地降低等离子体电流。",
