    "translated_abstract": "克利福德代数是实数、复数和四元数的自然推广。迄今为止，在知识图谱嵌入的背景下，只有形式为$Cl_{p,q}$（即没有零幂基向量的代数）的克利福德代数受到研究。我们提出考虑零幂基向量，其幂指数为2。在这些空间中，被称为$Cl_{p,q,r}$，可以泛化基于二次数的方法（无法使用$Cl_{p,q}$进行建模）并捕捉源于实数和复数部分间缺乏高阶相互作用的实体嵌入的模式。我们设计了两个新模型来发现参数$p$，$q$和$r$。第一个模型使用贪婪搜索优化$p$，$q$和$r$。第二个模型基于使用神经网络计算的输入知识图谱的嵌入来预测$(p, q, r)$。我们在七个基准数据集上进行的评估结果表明，零幂向量有助于捕捉实体的特征。",

By considering nilpotent base vectors with a nilpotency index of two, it generalizes approaches based on dual numbers and captures patterns lacking higher-order interactions in entity embeddings. The study designs two new models to discover the algebra's parameters and demonstrates the effectiveness of nilpotent vectors in capturing entity features."
