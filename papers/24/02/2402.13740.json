    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理（NLP）技术已经彻底改变了我们与信息系统互动的方式，着重于将自然语言查询转换为诸如SQL之类的形式化查询语言。然而，对于语料库查询语言（CQL）这一在文本语料库中进行语言研究和详细分析的关键工具，却没有受到足够的重视。手动构建CQL查询是一项复杂且耗时的任务，需要相当多的专业知识，这对研究人员和从业者都构成了明显挑战。本文提出了第一个旨在自动将自然语言转换为CQL的文本到CQL任务。我们提出了一个全面的框架，包括一个经过特别策划的大规模数据集以及利用大语言模型（LLMs）进行有效文本到CQL任务的方法。此外，我们建立了先进的评估指标，以评估这一同步过程。",
