    "abstract": "Presenting high-level arguments is a crucial task for fostering participation in online societal discussions. Current argument summarization approaches miss an important facet of this task -- capturing diversity -- which is important for accommodating multiple perspectives. We introduce three aspects of diversity: those of opinions, annotators, and sources. We evaluate approaches to a popular argument summarization task called Key Point Analysis, which shows how these approaches struggle to (1) represent arguments shared by few people, (2) deal with data from various sources, and (3) align with subjectivity in human-provided annotations. We find that both general-purpose LLMs and dedicated KPA models exhibit this behavior, but have complementary strengths. Further, we observe that diversification of training data may ameliorate generalization. Addressing diversity in argument summarization requires a mix of strategies to deal with subjectivity.",

    "translated_abstract": "在在线社会讨论中，提供高水平的论据是促进参与的关键任务。目前的论据摘要方法缺失了这项任务的一个重要方面，即捕捉多样性，这对于包容多个观点是重要的。我们引入了三个方面的多样性：意见、注释者和来源。我们评估了一种名为关键点分析的流行论据摘要任务的方法，显示这些方法在(1)代表少数人共享的论点上，(2)处理来自各种来源的数据以及(3)与人工提供的主观注释相一致方面遇到了困难。我们发现，通用的LLM和专门的KPA模型都表现出了这种行为，但具有互补的优势。此外，我们观察到训练数据的多样化可能改善泛化能力。应对论证摘要中的多样性需要采用一系列策略来处理主观性。",
