Since their introduction, researchers have actively explored the applications of LLMs across diverse fields, significantly elevating capabilities. Cybersecurity, traditionally resistant to data-driven solutions and slow to embrace machine learning, stands out as a domain. This study examines the existing literature, providing a thorough characterization of both defensive and adversarial applications of LLMs within the realm of cybersecurity. Our review not only surveys and categorizes the current landscape but also identifies critical research gaps. By evaluating both offensive and defensive applications, we aim to provide a holistic understanding of the potential risks and opportunities associated with LLM-driven cybersecurity.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现彻底改变了我们对智能的理解，使我们更接近于人工智能。自从它们被引入以来，研究人员积极探索了LLMs在各个领域的应用，显著提升了能力。然而，在网络安全领域，传统上对数据驱动解决方案持抵触态度且对机器学习采用较慢，这一领域却异军突起。本研究对现有文献进行了研究，全面描述了LLMs在网络安全领域中的防御和对抗应用。我们的综述不仅对当前的研究现状进行了调查和分类，并且还识别出了关键的研究空缺。通过评估攻击和防御应用，我们旨在提供对LLM驱动的网络安全所涉及的潜在风险和机会的全面理解。",
