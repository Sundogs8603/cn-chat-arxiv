In order to interact with and manipulate their environments, most legged robots are equipped with a dedicated robot arm, which means additional mass and mechanical complexity compared to standard legged robots. In this work, we explore pedipulation - using the legs of a legged robot for manipulation. By training a reinforcement learning policy that tracks position targets for one foot, we enable a dedicated pedipulation controller that is robust to disturbances, has a large workspace through whole-body behaviors, and can reach far-away targets with gait emergence, enabling loco-pedipulation. By deploying our controller on a quadrupedal robot using teleoperation, we demonstrate various real-world tasks such as door opening, sample collection, and pushing obstacles. We demonstrate load carrying of more than 2.0 kg at the foot. Additi",

    "translated_abstract": "四足机器人具有在维护、家庭支持和探索场景中变得至关重要的潜力。为了与环境互动和操作，大多数四足机器人都配备了专用机器人臂，这意味着与标准四足机器人相比具有额外的质量和机械复杂性。在这项工作中，我们探讨了“Pedipulation”-使用四足机器人的腿进行操作。通过训练一个强化学习策略来追踪一个足部的位置目标，我们实现了一个专用的Pedipulation控制器，它对干扰具有鲁棒性，通过全身行为具有大工作空间，并且可以通过步态的出现到达远距离目标，从而实现了运动-操作一体化。通过将我们的控制器部署在一个四足机器人上使用远程操作，我们展示了各种现实世界任务，例如开门、采集样本和推动障碍物。我们展示了足部负载携带超过2.0公斤。",
