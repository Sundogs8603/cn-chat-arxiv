    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了MIM-Refiner，这是一种用于预训练MIM模型的对比学习提升方法。MIM-Refiner的动机在于MIM模型中的最佳表示通常位于中间层。因此，MIM-Refiner利用连接到不同中间层的多个对比头。在每个头中，修改后的最近邻目标帮助构建相应的语义聚类。此过程短而有效，在几个epochs内，我们将MIM模型的特征从次优的状态提升到最先进的状态。使用data2vec 2.0在ImageNet-1K上预训练的ViT-H经过改进后，在线性探测和低样本分类方面取得了新的最先进结果（分别为84.7%和64.2%），超过了在ImageNet-1K上预训练的其他模型的表现。",
