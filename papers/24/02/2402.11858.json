    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了在随机Hessian-向量乘积上拟合Hessian或其逆。使用了一个Hessian拟合准则，可用于推导大部分常用方法，如BFGS、高斯牛顿、AdaGrad等。我们的研究揭示了不同Hessian拟合方法的不同收敛速率，例如，在欧几里德空间中的梯度下降的次线性速率和对称正定（SPL）矩阵和某些李群上的梯度下降的线性速率。在特定且足够一般的李群上的Hessian拟合问题在轻微条件下被证明是强凸的。为了确认我们的分析，这些方法在不同设置下进行了测试，如有噪声的Hessian-向量乘积、时变的Hessians和低精度算术。这些发现对依赖于随机二阶优化的方法是有用的。",
