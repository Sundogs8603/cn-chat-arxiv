There are two challenges: a lack of data and that models are too big. LLM based scorers correlate better with humans, but this expensive task has only been tested on limited QA datasets. We rectify these issues by providing clear guidelines for evaluating machine QA adopted from human QA contests. We also introduce Precise ANswer correctness Determination and Adjudication (PANDA), a small, efficient, deterministic AC classifier (812 KB) that more accurately evaluates answer correctness.",

    "translated_abstract": "问答（QA）只有在我们知道答案是否正确时才能取得进展，但对于许多最具挑战性和有趣的QA示例，当前的答案正确性（AC）指标与人类判断不一致，特别是来自大型语言模型（LLM）的冗长、自由格式答案。我们提出了两个挑战：缺乏数据和模型过大。基于LLM的评分器与人类更好地相关，但这项昂贵的任务仅在有限的QA数据集上进行了测试。我们通过提供清晰的指南来评估从人类QA比赛中采纳的机器QA，解决了这些问题。我们还引入了精确的答案正确性确定和裁决（Precise ANswer correctness Determination and Adjudication，PANDA），这是一个小巧、高效、确定性的AC分类器（812 KB），更准确地评估答案的正确性。",
