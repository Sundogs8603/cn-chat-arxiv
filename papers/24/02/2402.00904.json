    "translated_abstract": "由于图表示学习在现实世界应用中往往面临标签稀缺的问题，研究人员提出了图领域适应（GDA）作为一种有效的图之间的知识传递范式。特别是为了增强模型在目标图上的性能，GDA引入了一组与任务相关的图作为源图，并将从源图学到的知识适应到目标图上。由于GDA结合了图表示学习和领域适应的优势，它已经成为图上迁移学习的一个有前景的方向，并在近年来引起了越来越多的研究兴趣。在本文中，我们对GDA的研究进行了全面的综述，并详细调查了最近的进展。具体而言，我们概述了研究现状和挑战，提出了一个分类法，介绍了代表性工作的细节，并讨论了前景。据我们所知，这是第一篇对GDA进行全面调查的论文。",
