An important field of research is the application of such models at the cybersecurity context. This survey aims to identify where in the field of cybersecurity LLMs have already been applied, the ways in which they are being used and their limitations in the field. Finally, suggestions are made on how to improve such limitations and what can be expected from these systems once these limitations are overcome.",
