To integrate text information, various methods have been introduced, mostly following a naive fusion framework.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，基于会话的推荐引起了越来越多的关注，其目标是根据用户在会话中的历史行为提供定制的建议。为了推进这个领域，已经开发了许多方法，其中基于ID的方法通常表现出有希望的性能。然而，这些方法在长尾项目方面经常面临挑战，并且忽视了其他丰富的信息形式，特别是有价值的文本语义信息。为了整合文本信息，引入了各种方法，主要是遵循一个简单的融合框架。令人惊讶的是，我们观察到融合这两种模态并不始终优于遵循简单融合框架的最佳单模态。进一步的调查揭示了简单融合中潜在的不平衡问题，其中ID占主导地位，而文本模态则未充分训练。这表明意外观察可能源于简单融合的潜在问题。",
