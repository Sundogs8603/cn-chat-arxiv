    "abstract": "We present a new methodology for handling AI errors by introducing weakly supervised AI error correctors with a priori performance guarantees. These AI correctors are auxiliary maps whose role is to moderate the decisions of some previously constructed underlying classifier by either approving or rejecting its decisions. The rejection of a decision can be used as a signal to suggest abstaining from making a decision. A key technical focus of the work is in providing performance guarantees for these new AI correctors through bounds on the probabilities of incorrect decisions. These bounds are distribution agnostic and do not rely on assumptions on the data dimension. Our empirical example illustrates how the framework can be applied to improve the performance of an image classifier in a challenging real-world task where training data are scarce.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新的方法来处理AI错误，通过引入具有先验性能保证的弱监督AI错误修正器。这些AI修正器是辅助映射，其作用是通过批准或拒绝以调节之前构建的底层分类器的决策。拒绝一个决策可以用作建议放弃做出决策的信号。该工作的一个关键技术重点是通过对错误决策的概率界限提供这些新的AI修正器的性能保证。这些界限是分布不可知的，并且不依赖于对数据维度的假设。我们的实证示例说明了该框架如何应用于改善在训练数据稀缺的具有挑战性的真实世界任务中图像分类器的性能。",
