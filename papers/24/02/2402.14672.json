    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的应用已经远远超出了文本处理的范围，预示着一个新时代的到来，在这个时代，LLMs被设想为能够在复杂现实环境中运行的通用语言代理。这些环境通常非常广阔，使得LLM不可能在其短期记忆中处理它们。受最近关于通过工具扩展LLMs能力的研究启发，本文探讨了工具在增强LLMs处理这种复杂性方面的潜力。为此，我们设计了定制工具，以协助在这些庞大环境中进行主动探索。这些工具可以作为一个中间件层，使LLM免受环境复杂性的影响。在两个代表性的复杂环境--知识库（KBs）和数据库中，我们展示了在复杂环境中使用工具增强语言代理的重要潜力。",
