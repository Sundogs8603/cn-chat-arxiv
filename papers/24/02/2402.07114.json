    "translated_abstract": "本文对Adam的预条件效应进行了详细分析，并量化了Adam在减轻病态条件（困扰梯度下降法）上的作用程度。我们的关键发现是，Adam在病态条件上能够减少依赖于Hessian矩阵条件数的程度，但代价是会受到与维度有关的因素影响。具体来说，对于一个具有对角Hessian矩阵、条件数为κ的d维二次函数，我们证明了在没有动量的Adam中，控制迭代复杂度的有效条件数类似量为O(min(d, κ))。对于一个对角占优的Hessian矩阵，我们获得相应量的上界为O(min(d√(dκ), κ))。因此，当d < O(κ^p)，其中p = 1适用于对角Hessian矩阵时，我们可以得到这种量的界限。",
