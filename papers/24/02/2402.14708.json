    "translated_abstract": "信用卡欺诈对经济构成重大威胁。尽管基于图神经网络（GNN）的欺诈检测方法表现良好，但它们经常忽视节点的本地结构对预测的因果效应。本文引入了一种新颖的信用卡欺诈检测方法——CaT-GNN（Causal Temporal Graph Neural Networks），利用因果不变性学习来揭示交易数据中的固有相关性。通过将问题分解为发现和干预阶段，CaT-GNN确定交易图中的因果节点，并应用因果混合策略来增强模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。CaT-GNN由两个关键组件组成：Causal-Inspector和Causal-Intervener。Causal-Inspector利用时间注意力机制中的注意力权重来识别因果和环境",
