However, the learning performance data collected from Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) often suffers from sparsity, impacting the accuracy of learner modeling and knowledge assessments. To address this, we introduce the 3DG framework (3-Dimensional tensor for Densification and Generation), a novel approach combining tensor factorization with advanced generative models, including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), for enhanced data imputation and augmentation. The framework operates by first representing the data as a three-dimensional tensor, capturing dimensions of learners, questions, and attempts. It then densifies the data through tensor factorization and augments it using Generative AI models, tailored to individual learning patterns identified via clustering.

    "translated_abstract": "学习者的学习表现数据（如测验分数和尝试次数）对于理解学习者参与度和知识掌握水平非常重要。然而，从智能辅导系统（ITS）收集的学习表现数据常常稀疏，影响学习者建模和知识评估的准确性。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了3DG框架（三维张量稠密生成与生成性模型结合），这是一种结合了张量分解和先进生成性模型（包括生成对抗网络（GAN）和生成预训练变换器（GPT））的创新方法，用于增强数据填补和扩充。该框架首先将数据表示为三维张量，捕捉学习者、问题和尝试次数这三个维度。然后，通过张量分解对数据进行稠密处理，并利用针对个体学习模式的聚类进行生成性人工智能模型的扩充。应用于AutoTutor的数据中。",
