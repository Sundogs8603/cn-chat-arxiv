This proposal deviates from the traditional multimedia ecosystem, completely relying on in-house production, by shifting part of the content creation onto the receiver. We bring a semantic process into the framework, allowing the distribution network to provide service elements that prompt the content generator, rather than distributing encoded data of fully finished programs. The service elements include fine-tailored text descriptions, lightweight image data of some objects, or application programming interfaces, comprehensively referred to as semantic sources, and the user terminal translates the received semantic data into video frames. Empowered by the random nature of generative AI, the users could then experience super-personalized services accordingly. The proposed idea incorporates the situations in which",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种利用接收端的人工智能（AI）视频生成器的媒体服务模型。该提议偏离了传统的多媒体生态系统，完全依赖于内部制作，通过将部分内容创建转移到接收端。我们将语义处理引入框架，允许分发网络提供促使内容生成器的服务元素，而不是分发完全成品节目的编码数据。服务元素包括精心定制的文本描述、一些对象的轻量级图像数据，或应用程序接口，综合称之为语义来源，用户终端将接收的语义数据转换为视频帧。借助生成式AI的随机性质，用户可以相应地体验超个性化服务。该提议概括了其中情况",
