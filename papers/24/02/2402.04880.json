    "translated_abstract": "尽管移动设备的计算能力正在增加，但机器学习模型的大小也在增长。这种趋势给移动设备带来了问题，如内存容量和电池寿命的限制。虽然许多服务（如ChatGPT和Midjourney）在云中运行所有的推理，但我们认为灵活性和细粒度的任务分配更可取。在这项工作中，我们将模型分割视为改善用户体验的解决方案，将计算分割在移动设备和云之间，以减轻模型的计算密集部分，同时尽量减少数据传输的需求。我们展示了这种分割不仅减少了用户等待时间，还可以通过细粒度调整来优化云端的工作负载。为了实现这一目标，我们设计了一个调度器，收集网络质量、客户端设备能力和作业要求的信息，做出决策以实现在各种设备上的一致性性能。",
