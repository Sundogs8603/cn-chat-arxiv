    "translated_abstract": "仅使用一张航空或卫星图像来估计和计数树木密度是摄影测量和遥感领域中一项困难的任务。然而，它在森林管理中起着至关重要的作用。不同地形上各种各样的树木种类严重阻碍了树木计数模型的良好表现。本文旨在提出一个从具有足够标注树木的源领域学习并适应只有有限数量标注树木的目标领域的框架。我们的方法称为AdaTreeFormer，包含一个共享的编码器和一个分层特征提取方案，用于从源领域和目标领域中提取稳健的特征。它还包括三个子网络：两个用于分别从源领域和目标领域提取自注意力图，并一个用于提取跨领域注意力图。对于后者，引入了一种注意力适应机制，用于从不同领域中提取相关信息。",
