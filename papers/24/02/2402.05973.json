    "translated_abstract": "隐私、可扩展性和可靠性是无人机网络作为分布式系统所面临的重要挑战，特别是在使用大量数据交换的机器学习（ML）技术时。最近，在无人机网络中应用联邦学习（FL）改善了协作、隐私、韧性和适应性，成为无人机应用的一种有前景的框架。然而，为无人机网络实现FL引入了通信开销、同步问题、可扩展性限制和资源约束等缺点。为了解决这些挑战，本文提出了一种基于区块链的聚簇可扩展联邦学习（BCS-FL）框架，用于无人机网络。该框架将无人机网络划分为分离的聚簇，并由聚簇头无人机（CHs）进行协调，以建立一个连通图。聚簇化使得联邦学习在大规模无人机网络中的去中心化、协调、可扩展性和效率得到了改善。",
