    "translated_abstract": "图Laplacian学习，也被称为网络拓扑推断，是一个吸引多个领域兴趣的问题。在高斯图模型（GM）中，图学习等价于向协方差选择添加Laplacian结构。在图信号处理（GSP）中，从过滤系统的输出中推断未观察到的图是至关重要的。在本文中，我们研究了在Laplacian约束下学习笛卡尔乘积图的问题。笛卡尔图乘积是建模高阶条件依赖的一种自然方法，也是将GSP推广到多路张量的关键。我们建立了笛卡尔乘积Laplacian的惩罚最大似然估计（MLE）的统计一致性，并提出了一种有效的算法来解决这个问题。我们还扩展了我们的方法，以在存在结构性缺失值的情况下进行高效的联合图学习和插补。对合成和真实世界数据集的实验证明了我们的方法的有效性。",
