Specifically, we first use the input post as a query and enhance the representation of different modalities by retrieving information from external knowledge sources. For the retrieval-augmented representations, we employ a cross-modal context-aware attention to leverage the main modality description for targeted feature extraction across the submodalities title and code.

    "translated_abstract": "软件问答网站中的帖子通常包含标题、描述和代码三个主要部分，它们相互关联并共同描述问题。现有的标签推荐方法通常将不同的模态视为整体，或者不充分考虑不同模态之间的交互。此外，它们侧重于直接从帖子本身提取信息，忽略了来自外部知识源的信息。因此，我们提出了一种在软件问答网站中基于检索增强的跨模态标签推荐模型（RACM）。具体而言，我们首先将输入的帖子作为查询，并通过从外部知识源中检索信息来增强不同模态的表示。对于检索增强的表示，我们采用跨模态上下文感知注意力来利用主要模态描述对标题和代码子模态进行有针对性的特征提取。在融合过程中，我们采用了门机制来实现精细的特征融合。",
