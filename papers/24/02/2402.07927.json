    "translated_abstract": "提示工程已成为扩展大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉语言模型（VLM）能力的不可或缺的技术。该方法利用任务特定的指令（称为提示）在不修改核心模型参数的情况下增强模型的效果。提示允许将预训练模型无缝集成到下游任务中，仅根据给定的提示引发所需的模型行为，而不是更新模型参数。提示可以是提供上下文以指导模型的自然语言指令，也可以是调用相关知识的学习向量表示。这个新兴领域在各种应用中取得了成功，从问答到常识推理都有涉及。然而，对于多样的提示工程方法和技术缺乏系统的组织和理解。本调查论文通过提供对最近进展的结构化概述来填补这一空白。",
    "tldr": "这篇调查论文系统概述了大型语言模型中提示工程的最新进展，探讨了提示工程的方法和技术，并说明了其在各种应用中的重要作用。"
