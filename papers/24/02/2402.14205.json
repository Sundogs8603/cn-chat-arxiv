    "translated_abstract": "许多深度学习合成语音生成工具现已可以轻松获得。合成语音的使用导致了金融欺诈、冒充他人以及误导信息的传播。为此，已经提出了可以检测合成语音的取证方法。现有方法往往在一个数据集上过度拟合，并且在实际场景（例如检测在社交平台上共享的合成语音）中，它们的性能会大幅降低。本文提出了一种名为Patched Spectrogram Synthetic Speech Detection Transformer (PS3DT)的合成语音检测器，它将时域语音信号转换为梅尔频谱图，并使用变换器神经网络对其进行分块处理。我们在ASVspoof2019数据集上评估了PS3DT的检测性能。我们的实验表明，与其他使用频谱图进行合成语音检测的方法相比，PS3DT在ASVspoof2019数据集上表现良好。我们还调查了其在其他数据集上的泛化能力。",
