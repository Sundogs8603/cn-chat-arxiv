A causation is defined as a conjunction of one or more cause events occurring in an arbitrary order, with possible intervening non-causal events, that lead to an effect. The methods include recurrent and non-recurrent artificial neural networks (ANNs), as well as a histogram-based algorithm. An attention recurrent ANN performed the best of the ANNs, while the histogram algorithm was significantly superior to all the ANNs.",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文探讨了一些学习事件序列中因果关系的方法。一个因果关系被定义为一个或多个因果事件的组合，以任意顺序发生，并可能有非因果事件介入，最终导致一个效果。这些方法包括循环和非循环的人工神经网络（ANNs），以及基于直方图的算法。其中，注意力循环ANN表现最佳，而直方图算法明显优于所有ANNs。",
