Inspired by methods combining visual modality and Large Language Models (LLMs) through appropriate prompts, our framework (1) generates questions based on cultural categories from images, (2) extracts cultural visual elements from Visual Question Answering (VQA) using generated questions, and (3) generates culturally-aware captions using LLMs with the prompts.

    "translated_abstract": "图像字幕通过使用视觉-语言预训练模型（VLPs）如BLIP从图像生成描述性句子，这种方法已经取得了很大的改进。然而，当前的方法缺乏对图像中所描绘的文化元素（例如亚洲文化群体的传统服装）生成详细描述性字幕的能力。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的框架，\\textbf{面向文化感知图像字幕（CIC）}，该框架能够从代表不同文化的图像中生成字幕并描述文化元素。受到将视觉模态和大型语言模型（LLMs）通过适当的提示进行组合的方法的启发，我们的框架（1）根据图像中的文化类别生成问题，（2）利用生成的问题从视觉问答（VQA）中提取文化视觉元素，（3）使用带有提示的LLMs生成文化感知字幕。我们在4个不同大学的45名参与者上进行了人工评估。",
