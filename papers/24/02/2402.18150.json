The key reason is that the training of LLMs does not clearly make LLMs learn how to utilize input retrieved texts with varied quality. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective that considers the role of LLMs in RAG as ``Information Refiner'', which means that regardless of correctness, completeness, or usefulness of retrieved texts, LLMs can consistently integrate knowledge within the retrieved texts and model parameters to generate the texts that are more concise, accurate, and complete than the retrieved texts. To this end, we propose an information refinement training method named InFO-RAG that optimizes LLMs for RAG in an unsupervised manner. InFO-RAG i",

    "translated_abstract": "检索增强生成（RAG）通过将来自检索的额外信息整合到大型语言模型（LLMs）中，从而增强其性能。然而，研究表明，LLMs在有效利用检索信息方面仍然面临挑战，有时会忽视或被错误引导。其关键原因在于LLMs的训练没有清晰地让LLMs学会如何利用具有不同质量的检索文本输入。本文提出了一个新颖的视角，将LLMs在RAG中的角色视为“信息细化者”，这意味着无论检索文本的正确性、完整性或有用性如何，LLMs都能一致地整合检索文本中的知识和模型参数，生成比检索文本更简洁、准确和完整的文本。为此，我们提出了一种名为InFO-RAG的信息细化训练方法，以无监督的方式优化LLMs用于RAG。",
