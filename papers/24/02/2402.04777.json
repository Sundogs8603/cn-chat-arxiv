    "translated_abstract": "最大祖先图（MAGs）是一类在存在潜在混杂因素的情况下扩展了著名的有向无环图的图模型。大多数基于评分的方法通过使用BIC评分从经验数据中推断未知MAG，但该方法存在不稳定性和计算复杂性的问题。我们提出使用imsets框架通过经验熵估计和新提出的精化马尔科夫属性对MAG进行评分。我们的图搜索过程与\\citet{claassen2022greedy}类似，但是根据我们的理论结果进行了改进。我们证明了我们的搜索算法在节点数上是多项式复杂度的，通过限制度数、最大头部大小和歧视路径数。在模拟实验中，与其他现有的MAG学习算法相比，我们的算法表现出优越的性能。",

The algorithm improves the scoring method for MAGs by introducing the imsets framework and refined Markov property, and demonstrates polynomial complexity in the number of nodes. In simulated experiments, the algorithm shows superior performance compared to other MAG learning algorithms."
