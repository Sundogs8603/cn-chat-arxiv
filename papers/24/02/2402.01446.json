    "translated_abstract": "我们研究如何利用导引来提高长期多智能体路径规划（MAPF）的吞吐量。先前的研究表明，尽管将导引（如高速公路）纳入MAPF算法可以加速计算，但这往往会与解决方案质量产生折中。此外，如何自动生成良好的导引仍然尚未充分探索，当前的方法还无法超越手动设计的导引。在这项工作中，我们引入了有向导引图作为长期MAPF中引导的通用表示，并将导引图优化（GGO）的任务定义为优化其边权重。我们提出了两种GGO算法，用于自动生成适用于任意长期MAPF算法和地图的导引。第一种方法直接使用CMA-ES（一种黑箱优化算法）来解决GGO问题。第二种方法PIU通过优化一个能够生成导引的更新模型，展示了将优化过的导引图传播到较大地图中的能力。",
