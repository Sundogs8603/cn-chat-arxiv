We examine the class of crypto-backed stable derivatives, with a focus on mechanisms for price stabilization, which is exemplified by the well-known stablecoin DAI from MakerDAO. For simplicity, we focus on a single-collateral setting. We introduce a belief parameter to the simulation model of DAI in a previous work (DAISIM), reflecting market sentiments about the value and stability of DAI, and show that it better matches the expected behavior when this parameter is set to a sufficiently high value. We also propose a simple mathematical model of DAI price to explain its stability and dependency on ETH price. Finally, we analyze possible risk factors associated with these stable derivatives to provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the DeFi ecosystem.",

    "translated_abstract": "在去中心化金融（DeFi）中，像DAI这样的稳定币旨在在加密货币波动的情况下提供稳定价值。我们研究了一类基于加密货币抵押的稳定衍生品，重点关注价格稳定机制，以MakerDAO的知名稳定币DAI为例。为了简化，我们将重点放在单一抵押设置上。我们在之前一项工作（DAISIM）的模拟模型中引入了一个信念参数，反映了市场对DAI价值和稳定性的看法，并展示了当该参数设定为足够高的值时更好地与预期行为匹配。我们还提出了一个简单的DAI价格数学模型，以解释其稳定性和对ETH价格的依赖。最后，我们分析了与这些稳定衍生品相关的可能风险因素，为DeFi生态系统中的利益相关者提供有价值的见解。",
