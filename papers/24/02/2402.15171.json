Most existing algorithms (e.g. CUCB, ESCB, OLS-UCB) require prior knowledge on the reward distribution, like an upper bound on a sub-Gaussian proxy-variance, which is hard to estimate tightly. In this work, we design a variance-adaptive version of OLS-UCB, relying on an online estimation of the covariance structure. Estimating the coefficients of a covariance matrix is much more manageable in practical settings and results in improved regret upper bounds compared to proxy variance-based algorithms. When covariance coefficients are all non-negative, we show that our approach efficiently leverages the semi-bandit feedback and provably outperforms bandit feedback approaches, not only in exponential regimes where P $\\gg$ d but also when P $\\le$ d, which is not straightforward from most existing analyses.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了随机组合半臂老虎机问题，其中玩家可以从包含d个基本项的P个子集中进行选择。大多数现有算法（如CUCB、ESCB、OLS-UCB）需要对奖励分布有先验知识，比如子高斯代理-方差的上界，这很难准确估计。在这项工作中，我们设计了OLS-UCB的方差自适应版本，依赖于协方差结构的在线估计。在实际设置中，估计协方差矩阵的系数要容易得多，并且相对于基于代理方差的算法，导致改进的遗憾上界。当协方差系数全为非负时，我们展示了我们的方法有效地利用了半臂反馈，并且可以明显优于老虎机反馈方法，在指数级别P≫d以及P≤d的情况下，这一点并不来自大多数现有分析。",
