    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了从异步、相互依赖的多类型事件序列中学习格兰杰因果关系的问题。特别是，我们对以无监督的方式发现实例级的因果结构感兴趣。实例级因果关系识别单个事件之间的因果关系，为决策提供了更精细化的信息。现有文献中的工作要么需要强加一些假设，比如强加到强度函数中的线性假设，要么启发式地定义模型参数，这些不一定满足格兰杰因果关系的要求。我们提出了一种新颖的深度学习框架，即实例级自我注意力Hawkes过程（ISAHP），可以直接推断事件实例级的格兰杰因果关系。ISAHP是第一个满足格兰杰因果关系要求的神经点过程模型。它利用了变压器的自我注意机制，与格兰杰因果关系的原理相一致。我们通过实验证明了ISAHP的有效性和优越性。",
