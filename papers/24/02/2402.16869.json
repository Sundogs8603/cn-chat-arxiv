This chapter aims to clarify this critical regulatory blind spot. The main issue tackled is whether the adoption of AI harmonised standards, based on the future AI Act, should take into account fundamental rights. In our view, the response is yes. The high risks posed by certain AI systems relate in particular to infringements of fundamental rights. Therefore, mitigating such risks involves fundamental rights considerations and this is what future harmonised standards should reflect. At the same time, valid criticisms of the European standardisation process have to be addressed. Finally, the practical incorporation",

    "translated_abstract": "在欧洲背景下，欧盟人工智能法案提案和有关安全可信人工智能的标准化请求草案，将标准化与基本权利联系起来。然而，这些文本并未提供任何指导方针，明确阐明人工智能标准与基本权利之间的关系、含义或影响。本章旨在澄清这一重要的监管盲点。主要讨论的问题是基于未来人工智能法案采纳人工智能协调标准时是否应考虑基本权利。在我们看来，答案是肯定的。某些人工智能系统带来的高风险特别涉及基本权利的侵犯。因此，减轻这些风险涉及基本权利考虑，未来的协调标准应该反映这一点。同时，对欧洲标准化过程的有效批评必须得到解决。最后，实际整合",
