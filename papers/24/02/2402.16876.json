Most of the existing approaches have the assumption that the recommendation system only need to recommend a specific researcher for the task. However, academic successes can be owed to productive collaboration of a whole academic team. In this work, we propose a new task: academic team worker recommendation: with a given status: student, assistant professor or prime professor, research interests and specific task, we can recommend an academic team formed as (prime professor, assistant professor, student). For this task, we propose a model CQBG-R(Citation-Query Blended Graph-Ranking). The key ideas is to combine the context of the query and the papers with the graph topology to form a new graph(CQBG), which can target at the research interests and the specific research task for this time. The experiment results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "translated_abstract": "合作伙伴推荐是学术领域中的重要任务。现有方法大多假设推荐系统仅需为任务推荐特定的研究人员。然而，学术成功可能归功于整个学术团队的高效合作。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个新任务：学术团队成员推荐。根据给定的身份（学生，助理教授或主教授）、研究兴趣和特定任务，我们可以推荐一个由（主教授，助理教授，学生）组成的学术团队。为了完成这个任务，我们提出了一个名为CQBG-R（引用-查询混合图-排名）的模型。其关键思想是将查询和论文的上下文与图拓扑结构结合起来形成一个新的图（CQBG），这个图可以针对这次的研究兴趣和特定研究任务。实验结果展示了该方法的有效性。",
