When an agent chooses to take part, it undergoes multiple local updates before conveying its outcomes to the sub-sampled neighbourhood. Under this setup, we prove that the resulting asynchronous diffusion strategy is stable in the mean-square error sense and provide performance guarantees specifically for the federated learning setting.

    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们研究了一组以异步方式操作的代理，旨在发现适合个体本地数据集的理想全局模型。我们的假设是每个代理独立选择何时参与算法，并在任何给定时刻选择与之合作的邻域的特定子集。当代理选择参与时，它会在将结果传达给子采样邻域之前经历多次局部更新。在这种设置下，我们证明了得到的异步扩散策略在均方误差意义上是稳定的，并对联邦学习设置提供了性能保证。我们通过数值模拟来说明研究结果。",
