We utilized publicly available grocery shopping datasets used in the original paper and incorporated additional datasets to assess the generalizability of the findings. We evaluated the performance of the models using metrics such as Recall@K, NDCG@K, personalized-hit ratio (PHR), and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Furthermore, we conducted a thorough examination of fairness by considering user characteristics such as average basket size, item popularity, and novelty. Lastly, we introduced novel $\\beta$-VAE architecture to model NBR. The experimental results confirmed that the reproduced model, TIFU-KNN, outperforms the baseline model, Personal Top Frequency",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文旨在复制和扩展论文《对下一个购物篮推荐建模个性化商品频率信息》，该论文介绍了TIFU-KNN模型，并提出利用个性化商品频率 (PIF) 进行下一个购物篮推荐 (NBR)。我们利用了原始论文中使用的公开可用的食品杂货购物数据集，并结合其他数据集来评估研究结果的泛化能力。我们评估了各种模型的性能，包括 Recall@K、NDCG@K、个性化命中率 (PHR) 和平均倒数排名 (MRR) 等指标。此外，我们考虑了用户特征，如平均购物篮大小、商品受欢迎程度和新颖性，从而对公平性进行了彻底检查。最后，我们引入了新颖的 $\\beta$-VAE 架构来建模 NBR。实验结果表明，复制出的模型 TIFU-KNN 胜过基线模型 Personal Top Frequency。",
