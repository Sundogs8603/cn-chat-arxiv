    "translated_abstract": "我们解决了日益增长的担忧，即在缺乏公平约束的情况下，GNN可能会产生偏见决策，从而不成比例地影响到弱势群体或个人。与先前的工作不同，我们首次引入了一种将基尼系数作为公平性度量的方法，用于在GNN框架内使用。我们的提议，GRAPHGINI，在单个系统中处理个体和群体公平性的两个不同目标，同时保持高预测准确性。GRAPHGINI通过可学习的注意力分数来实施个体公平性，这有助于通过类似节点聚合更多信息。基于启发式的最大纳什社会福利约束确保了最大可能的群体公平。个体公平性约束和群体公平性约束都是以可微分的基尼系数的近似形式陈述的。这种近似是一个贡献",
