    "translated_abstract": "随机优势模型对决策时具有风险厌恶偏好的不确定结果进行建模，相比于仅仅依赖期望值，自然地捕捉了底层不确定性的内在结构。尽管在理论上具有吸引力，但随机优势在机器学习中的应用却很少，主要是由于以下挑战：$\\textbf{i)}$ 随机优势的原始概念仅提供了$\\textit{部分序}$，因此不能作为最优性准则；和 $\\textbf{ii)}$ 由于评估随机优势的连续性本质，目前还缺乏高效的计算方法。在这项工作中，我们首次尝试建立一个与随机优势学习相关的通用框架。我们首先将随机优势概念推广，使得任意两个随机变量之间的比较成为可能。接下来我们开发了一个有效的计算方法，以解决评估随机优势的连续性问题。",
