Poisoning attacks are particularly notable among user-side attacks, as participants upload malicious model updates to deceive the global model, often intending to promote or demote specific targeted items. This study investigates strategies for executing promotion attacks in federated recommender systems.   Current poisoning attacks on federated recommender systems often rely on additional information, such as the local training data of genuine users or item popularity.

Thus, there is a need to develop an attack that requires no extra information apart from item embeddings obtained from the server.

    "translated_abstract": "联邦推荐是联邦学习中一个显著的用例，但仍然容易受到各种攻击，从用户到服务器端的漏洞。毒化攻击在用户端攻击中特别引人注目，因为参与者上传恶意模型更新来欺骗全局模型，通常意图提升或降低特定目标项。本研究探讨了在联邦推荐系统中执行推广攻击的策略。当前对联邦推荐系统的毒化攻击通常依赖于额外信息，如真实用户的本地训练数据或物品流行度。然而，攻击者很难获得这些信息。因此，有必要开发一种攻击，除了从服务器获取的物品嵌入之外，不需要额外信息。在本文中，我们介绍了一种名为PoisonFRS的新型基于假用户的毒化攻击，用于促销",
