Four multilingual translation models were tested for their effectiveness in translating English to Arabic. Additionally, two models were assessed for their ability to generate SQL queries from Arabic text. The results showed that using back translation significantly improved the performance of both ChatGPT 3.5 and SQLCoder models, which are considered top performers on the Spider dataset. Notably, ChatGPT 3.5 demonstrated high-quality translation, while SQLCoder excelled in text-to-SQL tasks. The study underscores the importance of incorporating contextual schema and employing back translation strategies to enhance model performance in Arabic NLP tasks.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究介绍了AraSpider，这是首个阿拉伯语版本的Spider数据集，旨在提升阿拉伯语社区中的自然语言处理（NLP）。该研究测试了四个多语言翻译模型在将英文翻译成阿拉伯语方面的有效性。另外，还评估了两个模型在从阿拉伯文本生成SQL查询方面的能力。结果表明，使用回译显著提高了ChatGPT 3.5和SQLCoder模型的表现，这两个模型在Spider数据集上被认为是最佳表现者。值得注意的是，ChatGPT 3.5展示了高质量的翻译，而SQLCoder在文本到SQL任务中表现出色。该研究强调了将上下文模式和采用回译策略纳入阿拉伯语NLP任务中以提高模型性能的重要性。此外，提供了详细的方法论以实现结果复现并将数据集翻译成其他语言，突显了研究促进的承诺。",
