In newer approaches, procedural content generation utilizes machine learning.

The core of our research is to explore whether we can lower the barrier to the use of personalized procedural content generation through a more practical and generalizable approach with large language models.

    "translated_abstract": "Procedural content generation（程序化内容生成）使用算法技术以更低的生产成本创建大量新内容。在较新的方法中，程序化内容生成利用机器学习。然而，这些方法通常需要收集大量昂贵的数据，并开发和训练相对复杂的学习模型，这既耗时又昂贵。我们研究的核心是探索能否通过更实用和通用的大型语言模型降低个性化程序化内容生成的门槛。将游戏内容与玩家偏好进行匹配既使玩家更享受游戏，也使开发者更依赖玩家在游戏得到满足之后再进行变现。因此，本文提出了一种使用大型语言模型实现个性化的新方法。",
