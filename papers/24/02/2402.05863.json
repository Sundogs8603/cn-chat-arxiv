    "translated_abstract": "谈判是社会交往的基础；人们谈判从汽车价格到如何共享共同资源的一切。随着对使用大型语言模型（LLMs）代表人类用户行动的兴趣不断增长，这些LLM代理也需要具备谈判能力。在本文中，我们研究了LLMs之间的谈判能力。我们开发了NegotiationArena：一个灵活的评估和探索LLM代理谈判能力的框架。我们在NegotiationArena中实施了三种类型的场景，以评估LLMs在分配共享资源（终极博弈）、聚合资源（交易博弈）和买卖商品（价格谈判）方面的行为。每个场景都允许LLM代理之间进行多轮灵活对话，以进行更复杂的谈判。有趣的是，通过采用某些行为策略，LLM代理可以显著提高谈判结果。例如，通过假装处境困顿和绝望，LLM代理可以增加谈判成果。",
