It is a recurring argument in this debate that language develops \"naturally\" and that \"severe interventions\" - such as gender-inclusive language is often claimed to be - in the allegedly \"organic\" language system are inappropriate and even \"dangerous\". Such interventions are, however, not unprecedented. Socially motivated processes of language change are neither unusual nor new. We focus in our contribution on one important political-social space in Germany, the German Bundestag. Taking other struggles about language and gender in the plenaries of the Bundestag as a starting point, our article illustrates that language and gender has been a recurring issue in the German Bundestag since the 1980s. We demonstrate how this is reflected in linguistic practices of the Bundestag, by the use of a) designations for gays and lesbians; b) pair forms such as B\\\"urg",

    "translated_title": "社会规范变化助推语言变革：德国联邦议院中关于语言和性别的争议",
    "translated_abstract": "本文关注基于社会规范变化的语言变革，特别是关于语言和性别的辩论。辩论中经常提及的一个论点是，语言会“自然”发展，而对其进行“严重介入”（例如性别包容语言）在所谓的“有机”语言系统中是不恰当甚至“危险”的。然而，这样的介入并非前所未有。社会动机驱动下的语言变革既不寻常也不新鲜。本文重点关注德国联邦议院作为一个重要的政治社会空间。通过以德国联邦议院全体会议上关于语言和性别的其他争议为起点，我们的文章说明自1980年以来，语言和性别一直是德国联邦议院的一个重要问题。我们通过以下方式展示这一点：a）对同性恋者的称谓; b）双数形式（比如Bürg）",
    "tldr": "这篇论文关注社会规范变化引起的语言变革，特别关注德国联邦议院中关于语言和性别的争议。通过对德国联邦议院中其他语言和性别问题的讨论的分析，本文展示了语言和性别在议院中的持续问题，并通过对议院的语言实践进行了说明。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores how shifting social norms drive linguistic change, focusing on the ongoing debate on language and gender in the German Bundestag. By analyzing other discussions on language and gender in the parliament, the paper highlights the persisting issues and provides insights into the linguistic practices in the Bundestag."
