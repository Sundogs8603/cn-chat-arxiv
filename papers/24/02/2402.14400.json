Spontaneous motor activity, or `kinetics', is shown to provide a powerful surrogate measure of upcoming neurodevelopment. However, its assessment is by and large qualitative and subjective, focusing on visually identified, age-specific gestures. Here, we follow an alternative approach, predicting infants' neurodevelopmental maturation based on data-driven evaluation of individual motor patterns. We utilize 3D video recordings of infants processed with pose-estimation to extract spatio-temporal series of anatomical landmarks, and apply adaptive graph convolutional networks to predict the actual age. We show that our data-driven approach achieves improvement over traditional machine learning baselines based on manually engineered features.",

    "translated_abstract": "可靠的婴儿神经发育评估方法对于早期发现可能需要及时干预的医学问题至关重要。自发的运动活动，即“动力学”，被证明可提供一个强有力的预测未来神经发育的替代性测量。然而，它的评估在很大程度上是定性和主观的，侧重于对通过视觉识别的特定年龄手势的描述。在这里，我们采用了一种替代方法，根据数据驱动评估个体动作模式来预测婴儿神经发育成熟。我们利用处理过的3D婴儿视频录像进行姿势估计，提取解剖标志物的时空系列，并应用自适应图卷积网络来预测实际年龄。我们展示了我们的数据驱动方法相对于基于手动设计特征的传统机器学习基线取得了改进。",
