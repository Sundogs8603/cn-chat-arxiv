    "translated_abstract": "时间序列数据源自描述特定观察或感兴趣量随时间变化的应用程序。其分析经常涉及对不同时间序列数据序列的比较，这要求对这些序列进行对齐。动态时间规整（DTW）是实现两个时间信号之间最佳对齐的标准方法。已经提出了不同变体的DTW来满足信号对齐或分类的各种需求。然而，缺乏对它们在这些时间序列数据处理任务中性能的综合评估。大多数DTW度量在某些类型的时间序列数据上表现良好，但缺乏明确的解释原因。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一个合成框架，用于模拟比较两个时间序列数据序列之间的变化。我们的合成框架可以产生一个逼真的初始信号，并以可控的变化进行变形。",
