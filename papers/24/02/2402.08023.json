    "translated_abstract": "图形自动编码器的生成自监督学习已成为一种流行的学习范式，并在处理非欧几里德数据方面表现出了其有效性。然而，仍存在一些问题限制了现有方法的能力：1）在掩模中忽视不均匀的节点重要性，2）对整体图像信息的利用不足，3）由于仅在输出空间中使用重构损失，忽视了表示空间中的语义知识，以及4）由于遮蔽内容的大量，导致不稳定的重构。因此，我们提出了UGMAE，一种用于解决这些问题的图形Masked Autoencoders的统一框架，从适应性、完整性、互补性和一致性的角度来考虑。具体而言，我们首先开发了一个自适应特征遮罩生成器，以考虑节点的独特重要性并采样信息丰富的遮罩（适应性）。然后，我们设计了一个基于排名的结构重建方法，以维护图形的完整性和语义一致性，并使用额外的自监督任务增强图像生成过程（完整性和互补性）。",
