    "translated_abstract": "使用电池供电的可穿戴设备分析脑电图（EEG）记录，以监测脑活动和神经系统疾病。这些应用需要长时间连续处理以生成可行的结果。然而，可穿戴设备由于实际使用案例中的小尺寸而受限于有限的能量和计算资源。在限制的能量预算内，嵌入式异构多核平台（HMPs）可以提供更好的性能。可以进一步利用 EEG 应用程序流程的错误韧性来最大化 HMPs 的性能和能量收益。然而，在嵌入式 HMPs 上规范调整近似需要对准确性-性能-功耗权衡空间进行彻底探索。在这项工作中，我们对三种 EEG 应用（包括癫痫发作检测、睡眠阶段分类和压力检测）的错误韧性进行了表征。",
