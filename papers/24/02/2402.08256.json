    "abstract": "The knowledge concept recommendation in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is a significant issue that has garnered widespread attention. Existing methods primarily rely on the explicit relations between users and knowledge concepts on the MOOC platforms for recommendation. However, there are numerous implicit relations (e.g., shared interests or same knowledge levels between users) generated within the users' learning activities on the MOOC platforms. Existing methods fail to consider these implicit relations, and these relations themselves are difficult to learn and represent, causing poor performance in knowledge concept recommendation and an inability to meet users' personalized needs. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework based on contrastive learning, which can represent and balance the explicit and implicit relations for knowledge concept recommendation in MOOCs (CL-KCRec).

    "translated_abstract": "在大规模开放在线课程(MOOCs)中，知识概念推荐是一个备受关注的重要问题。现有方法主要依赖于MOOC平台上用户和知识概念之间的显式关系进行推荐。然而，在用户的学习活动中会产生大量隐式关系（例如，共同兴趣或相同的知识水平），现有方法未能考虑这些隐式关系，并且这些关系本身很难学习和表示，导致知识概念推荐表现不佳，无法满足用户的个性化需求。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于对比学习的新框架，用于在MOOCs中表示和平衡显式和隐式关系进行知识概念推荐（CL-KCRec）。具体而言，我们首先通过对MOOCs异构信息网络(HIN)进行建模来构建一个HIN模型。",
