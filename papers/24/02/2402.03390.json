    "translated_abstract": "嵌入式摄像系统是无处不在的，是无线嵌入式系统的最广泛使用的例子。它们捕捉了世界的表达 - 由可见光或红外光照亮的周围环境。尽管它们被广泛使用，但嵌入式摄像系统的架构仍然没有改变，这导致了一些限制。它们只可视化了世界的一小部分。此外，它们消耗能量高，导致电池寿命有限。我们提出了PixelGen，它重新构想了嵌入式摄像系统。具体而言，PixelGen结合了传感器、收发器和低分辨率图像和红外视觉传感器，以捕捉更广泛的世界表达。它们被有意选择出来，因为它们简单、低比特率和功耗低，最终形成了一种高能效的平台。我们展示了，尽管简单，捕获的数据可以使用基于transformer的图像和语言模型进行处理，生成环境的新颖表达。",
