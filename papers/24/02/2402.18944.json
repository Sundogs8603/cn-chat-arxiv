This task comprises three distinct subtasks - emotion recognition in conversation for code-mixed dialogues, emotion flip reasoning for code-mixed dialogues, and emotion flip reasoning for English dialogues. Participating systems were tasked to automatically execute one or more of these subtasks. The datasets for these tasks comprise manually annotated conversations focusing on emotions and triggers for emotion shifts (The task data is available at https://github.com/LCS2-IIITD/EDiReF-SemEval2024.git). A total of 84 participants engaged in this task, with the most adept systems attaining F1-scores of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.76 for the respective subtasks. This paper summarises the results and findings from 24 teams alongside their system descriptions.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了SemEval-2024任务10，这是一个关于在单语种英语和印地语-英语混合对话中识别情绪并找出情绪转变背后原因的共享任务。该任务包括三个不同的子任务 - 用于混合对话中情绪识别、混合对话中情绪转变推理、以及英文对话中情绪转变推理。参与系统被要求自动执行一个或多个这些子任务。这些任务的数据集包括手动注释的对话，重点放在情绪和触发情绪转变的原因上（任务数据可在https://github.com/LCS2-IIITD/EDiReF-SemEval2024.git获取）。总共有84个参与者参与了这个任务，其中最擅长的系统在各个子任务上获得了0.70、0.79和0.76的F1分数。本文总结了来自24个团队的结果和发现以及他们系统的描述。",
