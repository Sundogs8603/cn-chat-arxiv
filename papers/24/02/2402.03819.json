    "translated_abstract": "SMOTE（Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique）是处理不平衡数据集常用的重新平衡策略。我们证明了在渐进情况下，SMOTE（默认参数）通过简单复制原始少数样本来重新生成原始分布。我们还证明了在少数样本分布的支持边界附近，SMOTE的密度会减小，从而验证了常见的BorderLine SMOTE策略。随后，我们提出了两种新的SMOTE相关策略，并将它们与现有的重新平衡方法进行了比较。我们发现，只有当数据集极度不平衡时才需要重新平衡策略。对于这种数据集，SMOTE、我们提出的方法或欠采样程序是最佳的策略。",

It regenerates the original distribution by copying the original minority samples, with the density decreasing near the boundary of the minority distribution. This study also introduces new SMOTE-related strategies and compares them to other rebalancing methods, finding that SMOTE, the proposed strategies, or undersampling procedures are the best strategies for highly imbalanced data sets."
