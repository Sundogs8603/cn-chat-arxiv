    "translated_abstract": "骂人话是收集包含网络欺凌事件数据的常用代理。我们的重点是衡量和减轻由骂人话和因此数据收集策略导致事件之间的虚假关联产生的偏见。在演示和量化这些偏见之后，我们介绍了ID-XCB，这是第一个数据无关去偏技术，结合了敌对训练、偏见约束和去偏微调方法，旨在缓解模型对引发偏见的词的关注，同时不影响整体模型性能。我们在两个流行的基于会话的网络欺凌数据集上探讨了ID-XCB，同时进行了全面的消融和泛化研究。我们展示了ID-XCB学习了强大的网络欺凌检测能力，同时减轻了偏见，超过了最先进的去偏方法在性能和偏见缓解方面。我们的定量和定性分析表明其泛化性。",
