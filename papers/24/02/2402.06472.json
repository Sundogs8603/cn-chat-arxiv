    "translated_abstract": "故事创作作为一种综合性的表达艺术疗法形式，是促进家庭沟通的有效手段。然而，在治疗性故事创作中将生成式人工智能作为表达材料的整合仍未被充分探索。对于如何在家庭和治疗师中提供支持的人机交互（HCI）影响也存在缺乏。为了解决这个问题，我们的研究经过了为期五周的治疗故事创作会话，涉及七个家庭在专业治疗师的指导下进行。在这些会话中，家庭使用传统的艺术材料和基于图像的生成式人工智能来创作和发展他们的家庭故事。通过丰富的经验数据和四名专业治疗师的评论，我们描述了家庭如何创造性地融合人工智能和传统表达材料来外化他们的思想和感受。通过表达疗法连续体（ETC）的视角，我们表征了人工智能作为表达材料的治疗意义。支持儿童、父母的可取交互质量",
