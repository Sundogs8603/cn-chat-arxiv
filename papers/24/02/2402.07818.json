    "translated_abstract": "在特定任务的数据集上进行微调是利用预训练语言模型的强大能力进行各种下游任务的广泛接受的范例。由于预训练语言模型微调的普及以及与之相关的隐私问题，差分隐私预训练语言模型微调引起了越来越多的关注，以保护特定任务数据集的隐私。差分隐私预训练语言模型微调方法的设计核心是在隐私、效用和可扩展性之间达到满意的权衡。大多数现有方法都是基于DP-SGD的创新性工作。尽管将DP-SGD的可扩展性推到了极限，但基于DP-SGD的微调方法不幸地受到了SGD固有低效率的限制。在本文中，我们研究了DP零阶方法在LLM预训练中的潜力，该方法通过用更高效的零阶梯度来近似梯度，避免了SGD的可扩展性瓶颈。与将零阶方法作为一种替代方法进行处理不同，我们引入了一种新的割接框架，该框架能够以非常接近的方式模拟DP-SGD的基本操作，然后利用零阶优化方法来近似梯度。",
