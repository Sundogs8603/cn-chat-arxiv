    "translated_abstract": "自几年前出现大型语言模型以来，它们往往被视为许多人工智能问题的事实解决方案。然而，除了LLMs的许多不足之外，如可靠性、成本和速度等问题，还有一类常见的现实世界问题使大型语言模型表现不佳，即约束满足和优化问题。这些问题无处不在，目前的解决方案非常专业化且实施成本高。在Elemental Cognition，我们开发了EC AI平台，该平台采用了神经符号方法来解决约束满足和优化问题。该平台的核心是一个精确高效的逻辑推理引擎，并利用LLMs进行知识获取和用户交互。该平台支持开发人员用自然简洁的语言指定应用逻辑，并生成应用用户界面以与用户进行交互。",
