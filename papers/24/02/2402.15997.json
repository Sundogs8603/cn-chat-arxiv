We introduce Cieran, a tool that allows any data analyst to rapidly find quality colormaps while designing charts within Jupyter Notebooks. Our system employs an active preference learning paradigm to rank expert-designed colormaps and create new ones from pairwise comparisons, allowing analysts who are novices in color design to tailor colormaps to their data context. We accomplish this by treating colormap design as a path planning problem through the CIELAB colorspace with a context-specific reward model.

    "translated_abstract": "优质的配色方案可以帮助传达重要的数据模式。然而，要为特定情景找到看起来“恰到好处”的美观配色方案，需要相当多的设计和技术专业知识。我们引入了Cieran，这是一个工具，允许任何数据分析师在设计Jupyter笔记本中的图表时迅速找到优质的配色方案。我们的系统采用了一种主动的偏好学习范式，通过两两比较来对专家设计的配色方案进行排序，允许在色彩设计方面是新手的分析师根据其数据背景定制配色方案。我们通过将配色方案的设计视为在CIELAB颜色空间中的路径规划问题，并使用上下文特定的奖励模型来实现这一目标。在与十二名科学家的评估中，我们发现Cieran有效地模拟了用户的偏好来排名配色方案，并利用这一模型创建了新的优质设计。我们的工作展示了主动偏好学习的潜力。",
