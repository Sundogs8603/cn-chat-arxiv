    "translated_abstract": "国家统计机构（NSOs）越来越多地利用机器学习（ML）来提高产品的时效性和成本效益性。引入ML解决方案时，NSOs必须确保在统计算法的质量框架（QF4SA; Yung等,2022）中明确规定的健壮性、可重复性和准确性等高标准得到保持。与此同时，越来越多的研究关注公平性作为安全部署ML的前提，以防止实践中不同社会影响的出现。然而，在NSOs应用ML的背景下，公平性尚未明确讨论为质量方面。我们使用Yung等人 (2022)的QF4SA质量框架，并将其质量维度映射到算法公平性。这样，我们在几个方面扩展了QF4SA框架：我们主张公平性作为其独立的质量维度，我们调查了公平性与其他质量维度的互动。",
