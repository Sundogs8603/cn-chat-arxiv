    "translated_abstract": "拓扑优化是工程设计中关键的任务，旨在在给定的空间中以最佳方式分布材料以获得最佳性能。我们引入了神经隐式拓扑优化(NITO)，这是一种利用深度学习加速拓扑优化问题的新方法。NITO是第一个在基于深度学习的拓扑优化中提供无分辨率和域不可知解决方案的框架之一。与SOTA的扩散模型相比，NITO合成的结构具有高达7倍的结构效率，并且所需时间只有十分之一。在NITO框架中，我们引入了一种新的方法，即边界点顺序不变的MLP（BPOM），以稀疏和域不可知的方式表示边界条件，远离昂贵的基于模拟的方法。重要的是，NITO规避了限制卷积神经网络(CNN)模型处于结构化和固定大小域的领域和分辨率限制。",
