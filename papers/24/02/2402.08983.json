Jailbreak attacks, aiming to provoke unintended and unsafe behaviors from LLMs, remain a significant/leading LLM safety threat. In this paper, we aim to defend LLMs against jailbreak attacks by introducing SafeDecoding, a safety-aware decoding strategy for LLMs to generate helpful and harmless responses to user queries. Our insight in developing SafeDecoding is based on the observation that, even though probabilities of tokens representing harmful contents outweigh those representing harmless responses, safety disclaimers still appear among the top tokens after sorting tokens by probability in descending order.

    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLMs）越来越多地应用于代码生成和聊天机器人辅助等现实应用中，人们为了使LLM的行为与人类价值观保持一致，包括安全性在内做出了大量努力。越狱攻击旨在引发LLM的非预期和不安全行为，仍然是LLM安全性的重要威胁。本文旨在通过引入SafeDecoding来防御LLM的越狱攻击，这是一种安全感知的解码策略，用于生成对用户查询有益且无害的响应。我们在开发SafeDecoding时的洞察力基于观察到，即使代表有害内容的标记的概率超过代表无害响应的标记的概率，安全免责声明仍然出现在按概率降序排序的标记中的前几个。这使我们能够通过识别安全免责声明并增强其良性影响力来减轻越狱攻击。",
