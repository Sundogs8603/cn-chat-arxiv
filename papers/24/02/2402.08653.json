    "translated_abstract": "现代图神经网络（GNN）对输入图结构和节点特征的变化敏感，可能导致不可预测的行为和性能下降。本文引入了一种称为SAGMAN的谱框架，用于检验GNN的稳定性。该框架评估非线性映射中GNN在输入和输出流形之间引起的距离失真: 当输入流行中两个附近的节点（通过GNN模型）被映射到输出流行上的两个远离的节点时，意味着存在较大的距离失真，从而导致GNN的稳定性较差。我们提出了一种距离保持的图降维（GDR）方法，利用谱图嵌入和概率图模型（PGMs）来创建低维的输入/输出基于图的流形，以进行有意义的稳定性分析。我们的实证评估表明，SAGMAN能够有效评估每个节点在面对不同边缘或特征扰动时的稳定性。",
