    "translated_abstract": "胃癌和食管癌是导致全球癌症死亡的主要原因。在食管癌中，最近的研究表明PDL1免疫检查点抑制剂（ICI）与化疗结合可以提高患者的存活率。然而，我们对食管癌的肿瘤免疫微环境的理解仍然有限。本研究从接受第一线氟蘇氨酸嘌呤和铂类化疗的平台试验（NCT02678182）中的食管胃腺癌（OGA）晚期患者的多重免疫荧光（mIF）图像入手，旨在预测该治疗的疗效并探索对维持性达伐单抗（PDL1抑制剂）有效的患者的生物学基础。我们提出的基于人工智能的标记成功地识别出了反应者和非反应者（p <0.05），以及那些可能从ICI中获益的患者（p <0.05)。",
