However, comprehensively monitoring the situation only through public fixed-point surveys is challenging, and therefore information voluntarily provided by citizens assists in ascertaining the species distribution. To effectively encourage the citizens' data sharing behavior, this study proposed a prosocial incentive scheme in which, if they provide species information, donations are made to activities for saving endangered species. We conducted a field experiment with users (N=830) of a widely-used Japanese smartphone app to which they post species photos and measured the incentive's effect on their posting behavior. In addition, we measured the effect of a financial incentive scheme that provides monetary rewards for posting species photos and compared the two incentives' effects.

    "translated_abstract": "确定植物、昆虫和动物种类和位置对于生物多样性保护至关重要。然而，仅通过公开固定点调查全面监测情况具有挑战性，因此市民自愿提供的信息有助于确定物种分布。为了有效鼓励市民分享数据行为，本研究提出了一个亲社会激励方案，即如果他们提供物种信息，就会向拯救濒危物种的活动捐款。我们在一个广为人知的日本智能手机应用的用户（N=830）中进行了一项现场实验，他们在该应用上发布物种照片，并测量了激励措施对他们的发布行为的影响。此外，我们测量了一个金融激励方案的效果，该方案为发布物种照片提供货币奖励，并比较了两种激励方案的效果。分析结果表明，",
