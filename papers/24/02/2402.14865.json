    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的评估引起了社区的极大关注，因为存在数据污染问题。现有工作设计了使用针对特定任务的明确定义算法的评估协议，这些协议无法轻松扩展到不同的场景。此外，当前的评估基准只能提供整体基准结果，不能支持对LLMs能力进行细粒度和多方面的分析。在本文中，我们提出了元探测代理（MPA），这是一种受心理测量学启发的通用动态评估协议，用于评估LLMs。 MPA 是 DyVal 2 的关键组件，自然地扩展了先前的 DyVal。 MPA 设计了探测和评判代理，以自动将原始评估问题转化为一个新问题，遵循心理测量理论在三个基本认知能力上的应用: 语言理解、问题解决和领域知识。",
