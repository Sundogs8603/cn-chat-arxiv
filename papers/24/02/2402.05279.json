    "translated_abstract": "基于学习的方法正在成为黑盒动态系统的安全过滤器的有效途径。现有方法依赖证明函数（如控制界面函数（CBFs）和哈密顿-雅可比（HJ）可达性值函数）。我们工作的主要动机是认识到最终将安全约束作为每个状态的控制输入约束来强制执行才是最重要的。通过专注于这个约束，我们可以消除对任何特定证明函数设计的依赖性。为了实现这一点，我们定义了一个判别超平面，用于在每个状态上形成控制输入的半空间约束，作为安全的充分条件。这个概念不仅广泛适用传统的安全方法，而且通过消除对特定证明函数的依赖，简化了安全过滤器的设计。我们提出了两种学习判别超平面的策略：（a）监督学习方法，使用预先验证的证明函数信息来训练模型；（b）加速回归的方法，通过迭代生成判别超平面。",
