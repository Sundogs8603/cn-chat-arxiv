    "translated_abstract": "对话式密集检索已被证明在对话式搜索中非常有效。然而，对话式密集检索的一个主要局限性是它们缺乏可解释性，从而阻碍了对模型行为的直观理解以进行有针对性的改进。本文提出了CONVINV，一种简单而有效的方法，可以揭示可解释的对话式密集检索模型。CONVINV将不透明的对话式会话嵌入转换为明确可解释的文本，同时尽可能忠实地保持其原始检索性能。这种转换是通过训练一种基于专门查询编码器的最近提出的Vec2Text模型来实现的，利用了会话和查询嵌入在现有对话式密集检索中共享相同空间的事实。为了进一步增强可解释性，我们建议将外部可解释的查询重写纳入转换过程中。",
