DEAN distinguishes itself by capturing implicit structural information among facts through comprehensive modeling of both entities and relations. To effectively uncover latent out-of-date information, DEAN employs a contrastive approach based on a pre-defined Relations-to-Nodes (R2N) graph, weighted by the number of entities.

    "translated_abstract": "知识图谱（KG）因其在各个领域的广泛潜力而引起了广泛的关注。然而，过时事实的问题给KG带来了挑战，影响了其作为现实世界信息的整体质量。现有的过时事实检测解决方案通常依赖于手动识别。为此，本文提出了DEAN（深度过时事实检测），这是一个基于深度学习的新颖框架，用于在KG中识别过时事实。DEAN通过全面建模实体和关系之间的隐含结构信息，从而在区分事实方面表现出自己的独特之处。为了有效地揭示潜在的过时信息，DEAN采用了基于预定义的关系到节点（R2N）图的对比方法，该图由实体数量加权。实验结果证明了DEAN相对于最先进的基准方法的有效性和优越性。",
