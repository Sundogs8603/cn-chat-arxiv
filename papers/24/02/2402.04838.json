    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在使用大型语言模型（LLMs）减少命名实体识别（NER）的生成延迟。LLMs的高延迟的主要原因是顺序解码过程，该过程自回归地生成NER的所有标签和提及，显著增加了序列长度。为此，我们引入了PaDeLLM-NER（Parallel Decoding in LLM for NE），这是一种无需额外模块或架构修改即可无缝集成到现有生成模型框架中的方法。PaDeLLM-NER允许同时解码所有提及，从而减少生成延迟。实验结果显示，PaDeLLM-NER的推理速度显著提高，对英语和中文来说比自回归方法快1.76到10.22倍。与各种数据集上的最先进性能相媲美，同时维持了预测质量。",
