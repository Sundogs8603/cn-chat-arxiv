    "translated_abstract": "由于大型语言模型（LLM）在与用户进行流畅的多轮对话方面具有强大的能力，它们有潜力进一步提高对话推荐系统（CRS）的性能。与LLM擅长的无目的闲聊不同，CRS有一个明确的目标。因此，必须控制LLM中的对话流程，以成功向用户推荐适当的物品。此外，CRS中的用户反馈可以帮助系统更好地建模用户偏好，但现有研究忽视了这一点。然而，简单地提示LLM进行对话推荐无法解决上述两个关键挑战。在本文中，我们提出了一种包含两个关键模块的多智能体对话推荐系统（MACRS）。首先，我们设计了一个多智能体行动规划框架，可以基于四个基于LLM的智能体控制对话流程。这个合作的多智能体框架将基于不同的方案生成各种候选响应。",
