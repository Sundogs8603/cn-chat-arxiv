    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.11432v1 公告类型：新摘要：由于在许多实际场景中的重要性，欺骗检测引起了越来越多的关注。目前，数据稀缺阻碍了这一领域的发展。一方面，雇佣参与者模拟欺骗场景成本高昂。另一方面，很难在互联网上收集包含欺骗行为的视频。为解决数据稀缺问题，本文提出了一种新的数据收集流程。具体来说，我们使用 GPT-4 模拟了嫌疑人和警官之间的角色扮演。在审讯过程中，嫌疑人向警官撒谎，试图逃避犯罪责任，而警官揭露了事实并收集了证据。与先前的数据集相比，这一策略减少了数据收集成本，为增加数据集规模提供了一种有前途的途径。同时，我们将传统的欺骗检测任务扩展到欺骗推理，进一步为欺骗行为提供证据。",
