    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）具有执行各种文本处理任务并为提议的操作或决策提供文本解释的潜力。在混合工作时代，LLMs可以为设计混合工作计划的工作者提供智能决策支持。特别是它们可以为平衡众多决策因素的工作者提供建议和解释，从而增强他们的工作体验。在本文中，我们提出了一个在混合工作环境中工作区决策支持模型，利用LLMs的推理能力。我们首先研究了LLMs对于提供适当工作区建议的能力。我们发现，其推理能力超越了提示中的指导方针，LLMs可以在工作区资源的可用性之间进行权衡。我们进行了广泛的用户研究，以了解工作者在工作区选择上的决策过程，并评估系统的有效性。我们观察到，工作者的决策可能受到影响。",
