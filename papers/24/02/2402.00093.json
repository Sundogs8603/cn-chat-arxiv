    "translated_abstract": "System Verilog Assertion (SVA)的形式化是Formal Property Verification (FPV)过程中的一个关键但复杂的任务。传统上，SVA的形式化需要经验丰富的专家解释规格。这是耗时且容易出错的。然而，最近大语言模型（LLM）的进展使得基于LLM的自动断言生成引起了人们的兴趣。我们设计了一种新颖的基于LLM的流水线，用于从自然语言规格中生成英语、线性时态逻辑和SVA的断言。我们开发了一个基于OpenAI GPT4的自定义LLM用于实验。此外，我们还开发了测试平台来验证LLM生成的断言。只有43%的LLM生成的原始断言存在错误，包括语法和逻辑错误。通过使用从测试案例失败中得出的精心设计的提示，迭代地促使LLM，该流水线在最多九次提示迭代后可以生成正确的SVA。",
