We introduce a framework for developing causal distances between graphs which includes the structural intervention distance for directed acyclic graphs as a special case. We use this framework to develop improved adjustment-based distances as well as extensions to completed partially directed acyclic graphs and causal orders. We develop polynomial-time reachability algorithms to compute the distances efficiently. In our package gadjid (open source at https://github.com/CausalDisco/gadjid), we provide implementations of our distances; they are orders of magnitude faster than the structural intervention distance and thereby provide a success metric for causal discovery that scales to graph sizes that were previously prohibitive.",

    "translated_abstract": "通过因果发现算法学习的图形的评估是困难的：两个图形之间不同的边的数量不能反映出它们在建议因果效应的识别公式方面有何不同。我们引入了一个框架，用于开发图形之间的因果距离，其中包括有向无环图的结构干预距离作为一种特殊情况。我们利用这个框架开发了改进的基于调整的距离，以及对完成的部分有向无环图和因果序列的扩展。我们开发了多项式时间可达性算法来高效计算距离。在我们的gadjid软件包中（在https://github.com/CausalDisco/gadjid上开源），我们提供了我们的距离实现；它们的运行速度比结构干预距离快几个数量级，从而为以前无法扩展的图形尺寸提供了一个因果发现的成功指标。",
