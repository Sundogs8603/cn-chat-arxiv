We first propose an algorithm based on the decoupling technique for learning a classifier with only fairness guarantee. This algorithm takes in classifiers trained on different demographic groups and generates a single classifier satisfying statistical parity. We then refine this algorithm to incorporate differential privacy. The performance of the final algorithm is rigorously examined in terms of privacy, fairness, and utility guarantees.

    "translated_abstract": "在本工作中，我们研究了在差分隐私和公平性约束下的二元分类。我们首先提出了一种基于解耦技术的算法，用于学习一个仅具有公平性保证的分类器。该算法接受针对不同人口群体训练的分类器，并生成一个满足统计平衡的单一分类器。然后，我们改进了该算法以纳入差分隐私。最终算法的性能在隐私、公平性和效用保证方面得到了严格检验。对Adult和信用卡数据集进行的实证评估表明，我们的算法在公平性保证方面优于现有技术，同时保持了相同水平的隐私和效用。",
