In our deep learning scheme, teaching data is generated through the Monte Carlo method developed by Arai and Imai (2024). Moreover, the BNS model includes many variables, which makes the deep learning accuracy worse. Therefore, we will create another input variable using the Black-Scholes formula. As a result, the accuracy is improved dramatically.",
