    "translated_abstract": "蒙特卡罗树搜索（MCTS）是一种具有广泛应用的有效的实时算法。它通过将计算资源有策略地分配给搜索树中有希望的部分，使得它成为大规模搜索空间中非常吸引人的搜索算法。然而，当仍然存在最有希望的路径时，MCTS经常在重新评估之前探索过的区域上消耗有限的资源。我们提出的方法，称为AmEx-MCTS，通过引入一种新颖的MCTS公式来解决这个问题。AmEx-MCTS的核心是在树搜索过程中解耦值更新、访问计数更新和选定路径，从而使得已探索的子树或叶节点可以被排除。这种分离保持了访问计数在MCTS中用于探索-开发平衡和质量指标的实用性。结果增强了使用相同计算资源进行更广泛搜索的能力，同时保留了MCTS的基本特性。",
    "tldr": "AmEx-MCTS introduces a novel formulation by decoupling value updates, visit count updates, and the selected path in Monte-Carlo tree search, allowing exclusion of already explored regions. This enables a broader search with the same computational resources while maintaining the utility of visit counts for exploration-exploitation balancing and quality metrics within MCTS."
