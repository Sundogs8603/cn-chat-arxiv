    "translated_abstract": "尽管上下文化嵌入在自然语言处理中占主导地位，但基于这些嵌入和聚类方法的检测语义变化的方法在性能上不如基于静态词嵌入的简单方法。这是因为聚类方法产生词义聚类的质量较差，难以捕捉低频词义，尤其是低频词义。这个问题阻碍了研究一个语言中的词义变化对另一个语言的影响。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于图的聚类方法，用于捕捉跨时间和语言中高频和低频词义的微妙变化，包括这些词义随时间的增加和减少。我们的实验结果表明，我们的方法在SemEval2020四种语言的二元分类任务中明显优于过去的方法。此外，我们展示了我们方法作为一种多功能可视化工具用于检测语义变化的能力。",
