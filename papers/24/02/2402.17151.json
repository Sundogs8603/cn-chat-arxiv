    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.17151v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We propose a novel clustering pipeline to detect and characterize influence campaigns from documents. This approach clusters parts of document, detects clusters that likely reflect an influence campaign, and then identifies documents linked to an influence campaign via their association with the high-influence clusters. Our approach outperforms both the direct document-level classification and the direct document-level clustering approach in predicting if a document is part of an influence campaign. We propose various novel techniques to enhance our pipeline, including using an existing event factuality prediction system to obtain document parts, and aggregating multiple clustering experiments to improve the performance of both cluster and document classification. Classifying documents on the top of clustering not only accurately extracts the parts of the documents that are relevant to influence campaigns, but also capture influence camp",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的聚类流程，用于从文档中检测和描述影响力活动。该方法对文档的部分进行聚类，检测可能反映影响力活动的聚类，然后通过它们与高影响力聚类的关联来识别与影响力活动相关的文档。我们的方法在预测文档是否属于影响力活动方面表现优于直接文档级别分类和直接文档级别聚类方法。我们提出了各种新颖技术来增强我们的流程，包括使用现有的事件事实预测系统获取文档部分，并聚合多个聚类实验以提高聚类和文档分类的性能。在聚类的基础上对文档进行分类不仅可以准确提取与影响力活动相关的文档部分，还可以捕捉到影响活动",
