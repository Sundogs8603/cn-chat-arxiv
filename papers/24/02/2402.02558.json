    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型在各个领域和行业中产生了革命性的影响，如对话式人工智能、内容生成、信息检索、商业智能和医学等。在医学领域中，一个主要的应用是分析和调查与蕴含任务相关的临床试验。然而，人们发现大型语言模型容易产生捷径学习、事实不一致和性能下降的问题，即便在上下文变化很小的情况下。虽然进行了对抗性和鲁棒性测试以确保模型的输出完整性，但模糊性仍然存在。为了确保推理的完整性和正确的句法语义理解，我们使用了探测方法。在这里，我使用了记忆探测方法来研究在临床试验上训练的Sci-five模型。我调查了该模型在自然逻辑方面学习到的特征。为了实现目标，我训练了任务特定的探测器。使用这些探测器进行了研究。",
