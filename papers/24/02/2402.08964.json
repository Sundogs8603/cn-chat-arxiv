    "translated_abstract": "估计设备的整体用户体验是制造商所面临的常见挑战。目前，设备制造商主要依赖于微基准分数，如Geekbench，这些分数会对特定硬件组件进行压力测试，如CPU或RAM，但并不能很好地捕捉消费者的工作负载。系统设计师通常依赖于特定领域的启发式算法和对原型的大量测试来达到期望的用户体验目标，但制造商的性能声称往往与消费者的实际体验不匹配。我们在笔记本电脑的硬件规格上预测实际生活中的用户体验的初步结果。我们针对在Chromebook上运行的Web应用进行研究，以便对应用和工作负载的体验进行简单而公平的聚合。在54台笔记本电脑上，我们跟踪了常见的终端用户工作负载上的9个用户体验指标：网络浏览、视频播放和音视频通话。我们专注于高负载工作负载的子集。",
