In this paper, we highlight an important trend in robot coding education. We test several mainstream large language models on both traditional coding tasks and the more challenging task of robot code generation, which includes block diagrams. Our results show that GPT-4V outperforms other models in all of our tests but struggles with generating block diagram images.",
