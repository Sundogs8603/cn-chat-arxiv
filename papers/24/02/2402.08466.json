    "translated_abstract": "对人工智能（AI）相关危害更强大的治理的热情呼声正在世界范围内引起管理学者所称的基于管理的监管方法的采用。美国和欧洲的最新倡议以及国际标准化组织采纳的重要自我监管标准都共同具有一个核心的基于管理的范式。这些基于管理的倡议旨在通过增加人类对AI工具的培训和开发的监督来激励。因此，在这个新兴的基于管理的监管范式时代中，需要对人类引导培训技术进行完善和系统化。如果认真对待，人类引导培训可以减轻一些对AI的技术和伦理压力，以人类直觉提高AI的性能，并更好地满足对公平性和有效解释的需求。在本文中，我们讨论了连接。",
    "tldr": "这项研究认为，在人工智能的管理式监管方法中，加强人类引导和培训技术的研究和实践对于提高AI的性能，解决技术和伦理问题等方面具有重要作用。"
