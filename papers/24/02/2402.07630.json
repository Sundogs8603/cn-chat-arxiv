Toward this goal, we first develop our Graph Question Answering (GraphQA) benchmark with data collected from different tasks. Then, we propose our G-Retriever approach, which integrates the strengths of GNNs, LLMs, ",

    "translated_abstract": "在给定具有文本属性的图形的情况下，我们使用户能够使用对话界面向图形提出问题。针对用户的问题，我们的方法提供文本回复并突出显示图形的相关部分。与现有的方法将大型语言模型(LLM)和图神经网络(GNN)以各种方式整合起来不同，它们大多集中在传统图任务(如节点、边和图分类)或者在小型或合成图上回答简单的图查询。相比之下，我们开发了一个灵活的问题回答框架，针对真实世界的文本图形，适用于多个应用，包括场景图理解、常识推理和知识图推理。为实现这个目标，我们首先用来自不同任务的数据开发了我们的图问题回答(GraphQA)基准测试。然后，我们提出了我们的G-Retriever方法，它集成了GNN和LLM的优势。",
