    "translated_abstract": "默顿投资消费问题是金融领域和随机控制领域的基础问题。该问题的一个重要扩展是考虑交易成本，这在金融角度上非常相关，但从控制角度来看也具有挑战性，因为解决方案涉及到奇异控制。进一步的扩展将我们从加性效用转变为随机微分效用（SDU），这允许时间偏好和风险偏好进行分离。在本文中，我们研究了具有比例交易成本和Epstein-Zin SDU的默顿问题的扩展版本。我们充分刻画了所有参数组合，使得问题被良好提出（可能取决于交易成本的水平），并提供了一个完整的验证论据，该论据不依赖于额外的技术假设，只使用原始方法。使用SDU的情况需要新的数学技术，因为对偶方法会崩溃。",
