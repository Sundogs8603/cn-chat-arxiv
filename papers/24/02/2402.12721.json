    "translated_abstract": "开发图像识别模型的标准做法是在特定图像分辨率上训练模型，然后部署它。然而，在现实推理中，模型经常遇到与训练集中不同分辨率的图像和/或受到自然变化的影响，例如天气变化、噪声类型和压缩伪影。传统解决方案涉及为不同分辨率或输入变化训练多个模型，但这些方法在实践中计算成本高，因此不可扩展。为此，我们提出了一种新颖的神经网络模型，即并行结构和全组分傅立叶神经算子（PAC-FNO），来解决这个问题。与传统的前馈神经网络不同，PAC-FNO在频域进行操作，使其能够在单个模型内处理不同分辨率的图像。我们还提出了一个两阶段算法，以最小的修改训练PAC-FNO。",
