Existing methods use multimodal data or contextual information to enhance the detection of fake news by analyzing news content and/or its social context. However, these methods often overlook essential textual news content (articles) and heavily rely on sequential modeling and global attention to extract semantic information. These existing methods fail to handle the complex, subtle twists in news articles, such as syntax-semantics mismatches and prior biases, leading to lower performance and potential failure when modalities or social context are missing. To bridge these significant gaps, we propose a novel multi-hop syntax aware fake news detection (MSynFD) method, which incorporates complementary syntax information to deal with subtle twists in fake news.

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体平台的广泛传播助长了假新闻的快速传播，对我们的现实社会构成威胁。现有方法使用多模态数据或上下文信息来增强对假新闻的检测，通过分析新闻内容和/或其社会背景。然而，这些方法常常忽视了基本的文本新闻内容（文章），并且过分依赖序列建模和全局注意力来提取语义信息。这些现有方法无法处理新闻文章中的复杂、微妙的转折，比如句法-语义不匹配和先验偏差，导致性能较低，并在缺失模态或社会背景时可能失败。为了弥合这些重要差距，我们提出了一种新颖的多跳语法感知假新闻检测（MSynFD）方法，该方法融合了补充的语法信息，以处理假新闻中的微妙转折。",
