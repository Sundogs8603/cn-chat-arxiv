This paper analyzes the welfare consequences of transparency in corporate disclosure regulation in an environment in which regulatory disclosure constitutes the sole avenue for the verification of a firm's emissions.

Consequently, mandating full disclosure is no different from maximizing the firm's private benefit while disregarding the ensuing externality. When the regulator is symmetrically informed about the firm's energy efficiency level, transparency beyond binary disclosure does not lead to welfare improvements.

    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了公司披露规定中透明度的福利后果，其中监管性披露构成核实企业排放的唯一途径。研究表明，披露透明度与外部性之间存在潜在的权衡，二者之间呈非单调关系。而增加透明度永远不会让公司变得更糟。因此，强制进行全面披露与最大化公司私人利益的效果相同，而忽视随之产生的外部性。当监管机构对公司的能源效率水平具有对称信息时，透明度超出二元披露并不会导致福利改善。在信息不对称的情况下，最大化福利的披露采取阈值形式：阈值以上的所有排放存在外部.",
