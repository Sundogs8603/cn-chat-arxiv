    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.13278v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This work focuses on trying to understand how the construction of an airline's network is made. For this purpose, the case of Azul was studied, investigating which and how factors affect the decision of this airline to enter domestic routes, in addition to analyzing how the merger of Azul with the regional airline Trip affected the company's network planning. For this, an academic study was conducted using an econometric model to understand the airline's entry model. The results show that Azul's business model is based on connecting new destinations, not yet served by its competitors, to one of its hubs, and consistently avoiding routes or airports dominated by other airlines. Regarding the effects of the merger, the results suggest that Azul moved away from its original entry model, based on JetBlue, to a model more oriented towards regional aviation, entering shorter routes and regional airports.",

    "translated_abstract": "这项研究着重于尝试理解航空公司网络规划的建设方式。为此，对Azul进行了研究，调查了哪些因素以及如何影响该航空公司进入国内航线的决策，此外还分析了Azul与地区航空公司Trip的合并是如何影响该公司的网络规划的。为此，进行了一项学术研究，使用计量经济模型来理解航空公司的进入模型。结果显示Azul的商业模式是基于连接尚未被竞争对手服务的新目的地之一与其枢纽之一，并始终避免被其他航空公司主导的航线或机场。关于合并的影响，结果表明Azul从其最初基于JetBlue的进入模型转变为更加面向区域航空的模型，进入更短的航线和地区机场。",
