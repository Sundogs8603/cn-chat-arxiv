    "translated_abstract": "AI和ML技术的引入已经彻底改变了医疗诊断和治疗。医疗设备制造商渴望最大限度地利用AI和ML的优势，将多个应用程序整合到一个平台上。然而，同时执行多个AI应用程序，每个应用程序都有自己的可视化组件，会导致不可预测的端到端延迟，主要是由于GPU资源争用引起的。为了解决这个问题，制造商通常会为不同的AI应用程序部署单独的工作站，从而增加了财务、能源和维护成本。本文针对NVIDIA的Holoscan平台中的这些挑战提出了解决方案，Holoscan是一个用于流式传感器数据和图像的实时AI系统。我们提出了一个针对异构GPU工作负载优化的系统设计，包括计算和图形任务。我们的设计利用CUDA MPS对计算工作负载进行空间划分，并分隔计算和图形处理单元。",
