    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）取得了显著进展，在各种自然语言任务中展示出了前所未有的能力。然而，对于时间序列分析来说，从头开始完全训练一个大型通用模型具有挑战性，原因是时间序列数据的规模和种类庞大，以及导致概念漂移的非稳态，阻碍了连续模型适应和重新训练。最近的进展表明，预训练的LLMs可以利用复杂的时间序列数据依赖关系，并促进各种应用。在这项调查中，我们系统概述了利用LLMs进行时间序列分析的现有方法。具体而言，我们首先阐述了在时间序列上应用语言模型的挑战和动机，以及LLMs的简要基础知识。接下来，我们总结了基于LLMs的时间序列分析的一般流程，并将现有方法分类。",
