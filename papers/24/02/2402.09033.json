Given that platform data streams feature complex characteristics and interdependencies, we introduce a non-linear hierarchical forecast reconciliation method that produces cross-temporal reconciled forecasts in a direct and automated way through the use of popular machine learning methods.

    "translated_abstract": "平台业务在数字核心上运作，其决策需要不同层次（例如地理区域）和时间聚合（例如分钟到天）的高维准确预测流。为了确保不同规划单元（如定价、产品、控制和战略）之间的决策一致，也需要在层次结构的所有级别上进行协调预测。鉴于平台数据流具有复杂的特征和相互依赖关系，我们引入了一种非线性分层预测协调方法，通过使用流行的机器学习方法，以直接和自动化的方式生成跨时预测协调的预测。该方法足够快，可以满足平台所需的基于预测的高频决策。我们使用来自领先的按需交付平台的独特大规模流式数据集对我们的框架进行了实证测试。",
