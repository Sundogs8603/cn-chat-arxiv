    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种可扩展的算法，用于个体公平的（p，k）聚类问题，该问题由Jung等人和Mahabadi等人引入。给定度量空间中的n个点P，对于P中的每个x，令$\\delta(x)$为包含至少n/k个点的最小球的半径。如果聚类中的中心与x的距离小于等于$\\delta(x)$，则将其称为个体公平的聚类。虽然已经有了好的近似算法，但尚未提出具有良好理论保证的高效实用算法。我们设计了第一个快速局部搜索算法，其运行时间仅为~O(nk^2)，并且能够获得（O(1)，6）的双目标近似。然后，我们通过实验证明，我们的算法不仅比之前的工作快得多，而且还能够产生更低成本的解决方案。",
