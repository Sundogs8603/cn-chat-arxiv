    "abstract": "This paper examines the question of how generative AI can improve the well-being of blind or visually impaired people. It refers to a current example, the Be My Eyes app, in which the Be My AI feature was integrated in 2023, which is based on GPT-4 from OpenAI. The author's tests are described and evaluated. There is also an ethical and social discussion. The power of the tool, which can analyze still images in an amazing way, is demonstrated. Those affected gain a new independence and a new perception of their environment. At the same time, they are dependent on the world view and morality of the provider or developer, who prescribe or deny them certain descriptions. An outlook makes it clear that the analysis of moving images will mean a further leap forward. It is fair to say that generative AI can fundamentally improve the well-being of blind and visually impaired people and will change it in various ways.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了生成式人工智能如何改善盲人或视力受损人士的福祉问题。它引用了一个当前的例子，即Be My Eyes应用程序，在2023年集成了Be My AI功能，该功能基于来自OpenAI的GPT-4。作者描述和评估了自己的测试，并进行了伦理和社会讨论。该工具可以以惊人的方式分析静止图像的能力得到了展示。受影响的人获得了新的独立性和对环境的新感知。同时，他们也依赖于提供者或开发者的世界观和道德观，后者会为他们指定或拒绝某些描述。展望表明，对移动图像的分析将意味着进一步的飞跃。可以说，生成式人工智能可以从根本上改善盲人和视力受损人士的福祉，并以各种方式改变他们的生活。",
