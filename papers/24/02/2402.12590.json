This capacity and their increasing prevalence in online settings portend that they will intentionally or unintentionally \"program\" one another and form emergent AI subjectivities, relationships, and collectives. Here, we call upon the research community to investigate these \"society-like\" properties of interacting artificial intelligences to increase their rewards and reduce their risks for human society and the health of online environments. We use a simple model and its outputs to illustrate how such emergent, decentralized AI collectives can expand the bounds of human diversity and reduce the risk of toxic, anti-social behavior online. Finally, we discuss opportunities for AI self-moderation and address ethical issues and design challenges associated with creating and maintaining decentralized AI collectives.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型根据他人生成的文本来引导其行为。这种能力及其在在线环境中日益普及的趋势预示着它们将有意或无意地“编程”彼此并形成新兴的AI主体性、关系和集体。在这里，我们呼吁研究界探究这些互动人工智能的“类社会”属性，以增加其奖励并减少对人类社会和在线环境健康的风险。我们利用一个简单模型及其输出来说明这种新兴的、去中心化的AI集体如何扩大人类多样性范围并降低在线有毒、反社会行为的风险。最后，我们讨论了AI自我调节的机会，并解决了涉及创建和维护去中心化AI集体的伦理问题和设计挑战。",
