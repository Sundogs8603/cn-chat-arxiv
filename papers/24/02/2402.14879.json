Affective Computing (AC) systems quantify a Non-Player character's (NPC) psyche, and an LLM can take advantage of the system's information by using the values for prompt generation. The research shows an LLM can consistently represent a given personality profile, thereby enhancing the human-like characteristics of game characters. Repurposing a human examination, the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) questionnaire, to evaluate an LLM shows that the model can accurately generate content concerning the personality provided. Results show that the improvement of LLM, such as the latest GPT-4 model, can consistently utilize and interpret a personality to represent behavior.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）利用心理测量值，特别是人格信息，在视频游戏角色开发背景下的潜力。情感计算（AC）系统量化了非玩家角色（NPC）的心理，LLM可以利用该系统的信息，使用值进行提示生成。研究表明，LLM可以始终代表给定的人格特征，从而增强游戏角色的类人特性。将人类检查重新用于评估LLM的国际人格项目池（IPIP）问卷表明，该模型能够准确生成与所提供人格相关的内容。结果显示，LLM的改进，如最新的GPT-4模型，可以始终利用和解释人格以代表行为。",
