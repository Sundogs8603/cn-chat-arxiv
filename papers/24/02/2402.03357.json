    "translated_abstract": "本研究旨在通过部署揭露者传播真实新闻，最小化假新闻对社交网络的影响。这被设定为一种强化学习问题，每个阶段选取一个用户传播真实的新闻。一个具有挑战性的问题是一次性奖励，在社交网络上交织信息传播中，无法区分单个揭露者的选择所带来的“净”效应，只能观察到来自减轻努力的集体效果。现有的自我模仿学习（SIL）方法在从一次性奖励中学习方面显示出很大的潜力，但在实际的假新闻减轻应用中由于样本效率低下，不适用。为了学习更有效的假新闻减轻揭露者选择策略，本研究提出了NAGASIL - 基于负采样和状态增强生成对抗自我模仿学习，它包括两个针对假新闻减轻的改进:从负样本中学习和状态增强。",
