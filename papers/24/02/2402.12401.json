It highlights the need to balance operational and strategic factors, such as optimizing the use of resources - including aircraft, crew, and fuel - and managing the risks related to delays and congestion. The work details a national analysis focused on domestic flights, investigating the factors that influence companies to adjust scheduled flight times and the impact of this practice on punctuality. The results indicate that decisions about flight time are influenced by both operational and strategic aspects, being affected by competition and the sector's policies on punctuality and slot allocation. Furthermore, it was found that adding extra time is an effective strategy for reducing delays, although it may conceal system deficiencies.",

    "translated_abstract": "该研究探讨航空公司制定飞行时间的方法，强调需要平衡操作性和战略性因素，例如优化资源利用（包括飞机、机组和燃料）以及管理延误和拥堵引发的风险。该工作详细介绍了针对国内航班的国家分析，调查影响公司调整计划飞行时间的因素以及这一做法对准点率的影响。结果表明，飞行时间的决策受到操作性和战略性方面的影响，受到竞争以及该领域有关准点率和航班时隙分配政策的影响。此外，研究发现增加额外时间是减少延误的有效策略，尽管可能掩盖系统缺陷。",
