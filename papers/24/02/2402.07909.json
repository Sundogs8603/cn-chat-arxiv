    "translated_abstract": "数据可视化(DV)系统因其在大数据集中发现洞见的深厚能力而得到越来越多的认可，引起了工业界和学术界的关注。在某些声明式可视化语言(DVLs，如Vega-Lite、EChart)中，编制数据查询是一个重要的过程。自然语言处理(NLP)技术的发展使得使用自然语言界面来可视化表格数据的过程更加简单和直观，提供了更可访问和直观的用户体验。然而，当前将自然语言问题转换成数据可视化查询的方法，如Seq2Vis、ncNet和RGVisNet，尽管利用了复杂的神经网络架构，仍然不尽人意，有很大的改进空间。大语言模型(LLMs)如ChatGPT和GPT-4在各种NLP任务中取得了新的基准，从根本上改变了该领域的格局。受到这些进展的启发，我们引入了一种新方法。",
