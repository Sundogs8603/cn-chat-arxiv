    "translated_abstract": "获得大规模、精确标记的人物重识别（ReID）数据集是一个巨大的挑战。弱监督ReID已经开始解决这个问题，尽管其性能跑不过完全监督的方法。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了对比多实例学习（CMIL），这是一个专为更有效的弱监督ReID而设计的新框架。CMIL的特点是只需要一个模型，不需要伪标签，同时利用对比损失的技术，这在所有以前的基于MIL的方法中都不存在，但在传统的ReID性能上有显著提升。通过对三个数据集进行大量实验和分析，CMIL不仅在大规模SYSU-30k数据集上与最先进的性能相匹配，且假设更少，而且在WL-market1501和弱标记的MUddy racer重识别数据集（WL-MUDD）上始终优于所有基准方法。我们还介绍并发布了WL-MUDD数据集。",
