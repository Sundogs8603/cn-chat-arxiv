    "translated_abstract": "随着可变可再生能源在全球能源系统中的重要性日益增加，人们对于了解可变可再生能源短缺（“Dunkelflauten”）时期的兴趣也越来越大。在不同的可再生能源发电技术和地点之间定义、量化和比较这种短缺事件，是一个非常复杂的挑战。不同文献中存在着各种方法，如水文学、风能和太阳能分析，或能源系统建模。先前分析的研究对象范围从特定位置的单一技术到多个地区的多样化技术组合，要么关注可变可再生能源的供应，要么关注其与电力需求的不匹配。我们提供了一种量化可变可再生能源短缺的方法概述。我们解释并批判性地讨论了不同方法在定义和识别短缺事件方面的优点和挑战，并提出了进一步的方法。",
