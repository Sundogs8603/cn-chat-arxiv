    "translated_abstract": "常见问题解答（FAQ）是指关于特定内容的最常见询问。它们通过简化主题和通过简明扼要地呈现信息来增强理解，作为内容理解的辅助工具。在本文中，我们通过开发一个端到端系统利用文本转文本转换模型来解决FAQ生成作为一个明确定义的自然语言处理（NLP）任务。我们提供了一份涵盖传统问答系统的文献综述，强调它们在直接应用于FAQ生成任务时的局限性。我们提出了一个系统，能够根据特定领域的文本内容构建FAQs，提高其准确性和相关性。我们利用自我策划的算法来获得提供给输入的信息的最佳表示，并对问题-答案对进行排序以最大化人类理解。定性人类评估显示生成的FAQs构造良好且可推广至不同领域。",
