    "abstract": "In the reconstruction of fa\\c{c}ade elements, the identification of specific object types remains challenging and is often circumvented by rectangularity assumptions or the use of bounding boxes. We propose a new approach for the reconstruction of 3D fa\\c{c}ade details. We combine MLS point clouds and a pre-defined 3D model library using a BoW concept, which we augment by incorporating semi-global features. We conduct experiments on the models superimposed with random noise and on the TUM-FA\\c{C}ADE dataset. Our method demonstrates promising results, improving the conventional BoW approach. It holds the potential to be utilized for more realistic facade reconstruction without rectangularity assumptions, which can be used in applications such as testing automated driving functions or estimating fa\\c{c}ade solar potential.",

    "translated_abstract": "在立面元素重建中，识别特定对象类型仍然具有挑战性，并且常常通过矩形假设或边界框来规避。我们提出了一种新的方法来重建3D立面细节。我们将MLS点云和预定义的3D模型库结合起来，使用词袋法概念，并通过加入半全局特征来增强。我们在叠加了随机噪声的模型和TUM-FA\\c{C}ADE数据集上进行了实验。我们的方法展示了有希望的结果，改进了传统的词袋法方法。它具有在不进行矩形假设的情况下用于更真实的立面重建的潜力，可以在测试自动驾驶功能或估算立面太阳能潜力等应用中使用。",
