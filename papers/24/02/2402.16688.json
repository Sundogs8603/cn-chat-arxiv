    "translated_abstract": "噪声对比估计（NCE）是一种用于估计非标准概率模型的流行方法，比如能量基模型，这对于建模复杂数据分布非常有效。与依赖重要性抽样（导致ML-IS）或MCMC（导致对比散度，CD）的经典最大似然（ML）估计不同，NCE使用代理标准来避免评估通常难以处理的标准化常数的需求。尽管概念上存在差异，我们表明两种NCE标准，排名NCE（RNCE）和条件NCE（CNCE），可以被看作是最大似然估计方法。具体而言，RNCE等同于与条件重要性抽样相结合的ML估计，而RNCE和CNCE都是对比散度的特例。这些发现填补了两种方法类别之间的差距，并允许我们将ML-IS和CD文献中的技术应用于NCE，提供了几个有利的扩展。",
    "tldr": "噪声对比估计（NCE）方法与传统最大似然估计有所不同，但在特定条件下可以被视为最大似然估计的特例，这种发现架起了两种方法之间的桥梁，为NCE方法的进一步优化提供了可能性。",
