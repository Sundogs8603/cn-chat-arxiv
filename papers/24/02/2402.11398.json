    "translated_abstract": "在这项研究中，我们利用LLM来增强语义分析，为文本开发相似度度量，解决传统无监督NLP度量（如ROUGE和BLEU）的局限性。我们开发了一个框架，其中LLM（例如GPT-4）用于零样本文本识别和放射学报告的标签生成，在那里这些标签然后被用作文本相似性的度量。通过在MIMIC数据集上测试所提出的框架，我们发现GPT-4生成的标签能够显著改善语义相似度评估，得分更接近临床实际情况比传统NLP度量。我们的工作展示了使用LLM进行高度专业领域的文本数据的语义分析的可能性，具有半定量推理结果。虽然该框架针对放射学报告相似性分析进行了实施，但其概念可以扩展到其他专门领域。",
