We have proven that the deconvolution filter exists and eliminates the TF effect from signals whose statistics vary over time. This method is blind, meaning it does not require prior knowledge about the signals or TF. Simulations demonstrate the algorithm high precision across various signal types, TFs, and Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). In this study, the CS2 signals family is restricted to the product of a deterministic periodic function and white noise. Furthermore, this method has the potential to improve the training of Machine Learning models where the aggregation of signals from identical systems but with different TFs is required.",

    "translated_abstract": "这种方法解决了盲去卷积和估计通过传输函数(TF)传输到传感器的带噪声二阶循环平稳(CS2)信号的时间波形的双重问题。我们已经证明，去卷积滤波器存在并消除了统计特性随时间变化的信号上的TF效应。这种方法是盲目的，即不需要关于信号或TF的先前知识。模拟表明，算法在各种信号类型、TF和信噪比(SNR)下具有高精度。在本研究中，CS2信号族被限制为确定性周期函数和白噪声的乘积。此外，这种方法有潜力改善机器学习模型的训练，其中需要聚合来自相同系统但具有不同TF的信号。",
