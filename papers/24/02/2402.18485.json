    "translated_abstract": "金融交易是市场的重要组成部分，受到新闻、价格和K线图等多模态信息构成的信息景观的影响，涵盖了诸如量化交易和不同资产的高频交易等多样化任务。尽管深度学习和强化学习等先进AI技术在金融领域得到广泛应用，但它们在金融交易任务中的应用往往面临着多模态数据处理不足和跨不同任务有限泛化能力的挑战。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了FinAgent，一个具有工具增强功能的多模态基础代理，用于金融交易。FinAgent的市场智能模块处理各种数据-数值、文本和图像-以准确分析金融市场。其独特的双重反射模块不仅能够快速适应市场动态，还融合了多样化的记忆检索。",
