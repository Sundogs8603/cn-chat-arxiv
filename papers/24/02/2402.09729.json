    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文研究了如何在移动边缘计算系统中为异构用户提供定制化的虚拟现实（VR）服务的资源分配问题。首先引入了一种体验质量（QoE）度量方法来衡量用户体验，考虑了移动边缘计算系统的延迟、用户注意力水平和首选分辨率。然后，建立了一个QoE最大化问题以保证最高可能的用户体验，将其作为一个强化学习问题来解决，旨在学习一个适用于所有MEC服务器的各种用户环境的通用策略。为了学习这个通用策略，我们提出了一个使用联邦学习（FL）和基于prompt的序列建模来预训练MEC服务器之间共同决策模型的框架，即FedPromptDT。使用FL解决了本地MEC数据不足的问题，同时在离线训练过程中保护用户的隐私。",
