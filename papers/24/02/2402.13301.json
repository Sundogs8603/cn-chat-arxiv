Yet, multi-scale hierarchical structure is a distinctive feature of music signals. To leverage this information, we propose a structure-informed positional encoding framework for music generation with Transformers. We design three variants in terms of absolute, relative and non-stationary positional information. We comprehensively test them on two symbolic music generation tasks: next-timestep prediction and accompaniment generation. As a comparison, we choose multiple baselines from the literature and demonstrate the merits of our methods using several musically-motivated evaluation metrics. In particular, our methods improve the melodic and structural consistency of the generated pieces.",

    "translated_abstract": "由深度学习方法生成的音乐往往缺乏连贯性和长期组织，而多尺度层次结构是音乐信号的显著特征。为了利用这一信息，我们提出了一种针对Transformer音乐生成的结构感知位置编码框架。我们设计了三种变体，涉及绝对、相对和非平稳位置信息。我们在两个符号音乐生成任务上对它们进行了全面测试：下一个时间步预测和伴奏生成。作为对比，我们选择了文献中的多个基线，使用几个以音乐为动机的评估指标展示了我们方法的优点。特别是，我们的方法改善了生成作品的旋律和结构一致性。",
