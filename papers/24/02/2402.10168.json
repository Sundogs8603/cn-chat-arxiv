    "translated_abstract": "《arXiv:2402.10168v1 公告类型: 交叉》 摘要：印度古典音乐(ICM)的一个重要方面是Raga，它作为作曲和即兴演奏的旋律框架。Raga的识别是ICM中一项重要的音乐信息检索任务，它可以帮助从音乐推荐到组织大型音乐收藏等多种下游应用。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于深度学习的Raga识别方法。我们的方法采用有效的预处理，使用基于长短期记忆(LSTM)的递归神经网络(RNN)学习音乐数据中的时间序列。我们在采样自原始音频的较小序列上进行网络的训练和测试，而最终的推理则是在整个音频上进行的。我们的方法在Comp Music Carnatic数据集和其10个Raga子集上的推理过程中分别达到了88.1%和97%的准确率，使其成为Raga识别任务的最新技术。我们的方法还使序列排序成为可能。",
