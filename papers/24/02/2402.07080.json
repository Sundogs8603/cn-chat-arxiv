    "translated_abstract": "公式化的Alpha是将原始股票数据转化为指示信号的数学公式。在行业中，将一系列公式化的Alpha组合在一起可以提高建模精确性。现有的Alpha挖掘方法只使用神经网络智能体，无法利用解空间的结构信息。此外，它们没有考虑到集合中Alpha之间的相关性，这限制了协同表现。为解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新颖的Alpha挖掘框架，将Alpha挖掘问题形式化为奖励密集的马尔科夫决策过程（MDP），并通过风险追求蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）解决MDP。基于MCTS的智能体充分利用离散解空间的结构信息，而风险追求策略明确优化最佳情况的表现而非平均结果。我们进行了全面的实验证明了我们框架的效率。我们的方法优于所有最新技术。",
