    "translated_title": "人工智能与高等教育机构的转型",
    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）的进步和ChatGPT等生成式AI工具的快速采用为高等教育带来了新的机遇和挑战。虽然大量的文献讨论了高等教育中的AI，但缺乏一个系统的方法来全面理解高等教育机构的AI转型。为了填补这一空白，本文采用复杂系统的方法，构建了一个因果循环图（CLD），以描述典型高等教育机构中AI转型的因果反馈机制。我们的模型考虑了推动AI转型的力量以及AI转型对典型高等教育机构价值创造的影响。本文识别和分析了几个增强和平衡的反馈循环，展示了高等教育机构在AI技术进步的推动下如何投资于改善学生学习、研究和管理。高等教育机构必须采取措施应对学术诚信问题并适应可用技术的变化。",
