We re-evaluate LLM performance using well-established practices and find that DGL's data in fact provide evidence for just how well LLMs capture human behaviors.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）是否具有类似人类的语言普遍性？Dentella等人（2023年；“DGL”）使用多个LLMs提示语法正确性问题，以获取80个英语句子的语法句子判断，得出LLMs存在“是”偏向和“不能区分语法和非语法句子”的结论。我们采用了既定的实践方法重新评估LLM的性能，并发现DGL的数据实际上证明了LLM如何准确捕捉人类行为。模型不仅整体上实现了高准确率，还捕捉到了人类语言判断的细微变化。",
