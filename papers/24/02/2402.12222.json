    "translated_abstract": "模糊测试是一种有效的发现错误的技术，但在像需要精确语法输入的JavaScript引擎这样的复杂系统中很难应用。最近，研究人员采用语言模型对模糊测试中的上下文感知变异进行了改进以解决这一问题。然而，现有技术在利用覆盖引导进行模糊测试方面存在局限性，通常以黑盒方式执行。本文提出了一种名为CovRL（基于覆盖引导的强化学习）的新技术，将大型语言模型（LLMs）与从覆盖反馈中得到的强化学习相结合。我们的模糊器CovRL-Fuzz通过利用词频-逆文档频率（TF-IDF）方法将覆盖反馈直接集成到LLM中，构建加权覆盖映射。该映射在计算模糊测试奖励中起着关键作用，然后通过强化学习应用于基于LLM的变异器。通过这种方法，CovRL-Fuzz实现了...",
