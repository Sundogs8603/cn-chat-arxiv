    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.14402v1 公告类型: 新摘要: 顺序学习方法例如主动学习和贝叶斯优化选择最具信息量的数据来学习一个任务。在许多医学或工程应用中，数据选择受先验未知的安全条件限制。一条有前途的安全学习方法利用高斯过程（GPs）来建模安全概率，并在具有较高安全置信度的区域中进行数据选择。然而，准确的安全建模需要先验知识或消耗数据。此外，安全置信度集中在给定的观测值周围，导致局部探索。由于在安全关键实验中通常存在可转移的源知识，我们提出考虑转移安全顺序学习来加速安全学习。我们进一步考虑先计算源组件，以减少引入源数据带来的额外计算负载。",
