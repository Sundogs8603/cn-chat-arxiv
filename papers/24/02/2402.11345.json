    "translated_abstract": "Bayesian optimization 是一种广泛使用的优化黑盒函数的技术，期望改进（EI）是该领域中最常用的获取函数。虽然 EI 通常被视为与其他信息理论获取函数（如熵搜索（ES）和最大值熵搜索（MES））不同，但我们的工作揭示了，通过变分推断（VI）方法，EI 可以被视为 MES 的一种特殊情况。在这一背景下，我们开发了变分熵搜索（VES）方法和 VES-Gamma 算法，通过将信息理论概念的原则整合到 EI 中来调整 EI。VES-Gamma 的有效性在各种测试函数和真实数据集中得到了证明，突出了它在贝叶斯优化场景中的理论和实际用途。",
