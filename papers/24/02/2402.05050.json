While collaboration among clients can significantly enhance the learning process, not all collaborations are beneficial; some may even be detrimental. In this study, we introduce a novel algorithm that assigns adaptive aggregation weights to clients participating in FL training, identifying those with data distributions most conducive to a specific learning objective. We demonstrate that our aggregation method converges no worse than the method that aggregates only the updates received from clients with the same data distribution. Furthermore, empirical evaluations consistently reveal that collaborations guided by our algorithm outperform traditional FL approaches. This underscores the critical role of judicious client selection and lays the foundation for more streamlined and effective FL implementations in the coming years.",

    "translated_abstract": "在Federated Learning (FL)中，分布式性质和客户数据的异质性既带来了机会，也带来了挑战。虽然客户之间的合作可以显著增强学习过程，但并不是所有的合作都是有益的；有些甚至可能是有害的。在这项研究中，我们引入了一种新颖的算法，为参与FL训练的客户分配自适应的聚合权重，识别出数据分布对特定学习目标最有益的客户。我们证明了我们的聚合方法的收敛性与仅聚合具有相同数据分布的客户接收的更新的方法不相上下。此外，经验证明，由我们的算法引导的合作优于传统的FL方法。这强调了审慎选择客户的关键作用，并为未来更简化和有效的FL实现奠定了基础。",
