    "title": "Reading Between the Tweets: Deciphering Ideological Stances of Interconnected Mixed-Ideology Communities",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in NLP have improved our ability to understand the nuanced worldviews of online communities. Existing research focused on probing ideological stances treats liberals and conservatives as separate groups. However, this fails to account for the nuanced views of the organically formed online communities and the connections between them. In this paper, we study discussions of the 2020 U.S. election on Twitter to identify complex interacting communities. Capitalizing on this interconnectedness, we introduce a novel approach that harnesses message passing when finetuning language models (LMs) to probe the nuanced ideologies of these communities. By comparing the responses generated by LMs and real-world survey results, our method shows higher alignment than existing baselines, highlighting the potential of using LMs in revealing complex ideologies within and across interconnected mixed-ideology communities.",

    "translated_abstract": "自然语言处理的最新发展提高了我们理解在线社区的微妙世界观的能力。现有研究关注的是探索意识形态立场时将自由派和保守派视为不同的群体。然而，这未能考虑到有机形成的在线社区和它们之间的联系的微妙观点。在本文中，我们研究了关于2020年美国选举的Twitter讨论，以识别复杂的相互作用社区。充分利用这种相互关系，我们引入了一种新颖的方法，在微调语言模型（LMs）时利用信息传递来探索这些社区的微妙意识形态。通过比较由LMs生成的回复和真实世界的调查结果，我们的方法显示出比现有基准线更高的一致性，突显了在和跨相互联系的杂合意识形态社区中利用LMs揭示复杂意识形态的潜力。",
