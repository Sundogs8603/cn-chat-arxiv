    "translated_abstract": "在开发遵守社会标准的大型语言模型（LLMs）的过程中，识别生成文本中的毒性存在至关重要。现有的大多数毒性度量依赖于在特定毒性数据集上训练的编码模型。然而，这些编码器容易受到分布外的问题的影响，并且依赖于数据集中所假定的毒性定义。本文介绍了一种基于LLMs的自动鲁棒度量，用于区分模型回应是否具有毒性。我们首先分析了毒性因素，然后研究了LLMs的内在毒性属性，以确定它们作为评估器的适用性。随后，我们对评估数据集上的度量指标LLMs As ToxiciTy Evaluators（LATTE）进行了评估。实证结果表明，在不进行训练过程的情况下，我们的度量在测量毒性方面表现出色，F1得分比现有技术指标提高了12个百分点。我们还展示了上游毒性对度量结果的影响。",
