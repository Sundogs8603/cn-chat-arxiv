    "translated_abstract": "在信息提取（IE）领域，监督分类方法的卓越性能严重依赖于大量的黄金标准数据。最近的零样本分类方法将任务转化为其他NLP任务（例如，文本蕴涵），并使用这些NLP任务的现成模型直接对测试数据进行推理，而无需使用大量的IE注释数据。这些方法的一个潜在有价值的副产品是大规模的银标准数据，即其他NLP任务的现成模型生成的伪标记数据。然而，对于这些数据的利用并没有进一步的研究。本文提出了一个新框架Clean-LaVe，旨在利用银标准数据来增强零样本分类性能。Clean-LaVe包括四个阶段：（1）获取银标准数据；（2）从银标准数据中识别相对干净的数据；（3）使用干净数据微调现成模型；",
