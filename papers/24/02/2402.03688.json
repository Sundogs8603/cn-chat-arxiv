    "translated_abstract": "垂直联邦学习（Vertical Federated Learning，VFL）是一种联邦学习范式，多个参与者共同训练机器学习模型，这些参与者共享相同的样本集，但持有不同的特征。虽然VFL在不共享原始数据的情况下实现了协同机器学习，但仍然容易受到各种隐私威胁的影响。本文首次对VFL中的隐私攻击和防御的最新研究进行了全面的调查。我们根据特征对攻击和防御进行分类，并讨论了开放性挑战和未来的研究方向。具体而言，我们的讨论围绕模型的生命周期展开，深入探讨了机器学习的不同阶段遇到的隐私威胁及相应的对策。这项调查既为研究界提供了资源，也为实践者提供了明确的指导和可行的见解，以保护数据隐私。",
