    "abstract": "Machine learning has enabled the development of powerful systems capable of editing images from natural language instructions. However, in many common scenarios it is difficult for users to specify precise image transformations with text alone. For example, in an image with several dogs, it is difficult to select a particular dog and move it to a precise location. Doing this with text alone would require a complex prompt that disambiguates the target dog and describes the destination. However, direct manipulation is well suited to visual tasks like selecting objects and specifying locations. We introduce Point and Instruct, a system for seamlessly combining familiar direct manipulation and textual instructions to enable precise image manipulation. With our system, a user can visually mark objects and locations, and reference them in textual instructions. This allows users to benefit from both the visual descriptiveness of natural language and the spatial precision of direct manipulatio",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习使得能够通过自然语言指令编辑图像的强大系统得以开发。然而，在许多常见情景下，使用者很难仅通过文本来指定精确的图像变换。例如，在一张包含多只狗的图像中，难以选择特定的狗并将其移动到一个精确的位置。仅通过文本完成这个操作需要一个复杂的提示，用于确定目标狗，并描述目的位置。然而，直接操作很适合于选择对象和指定位置等视觉任务。我们引入了一个名为点选与指导的系统，通过无缝地结合直接操作和文本指令，实现精确图像编辑。通过我们的系统，用户可以在视觉上标记对象和位置，并在文本指令中引用它们。这使得用户既能从自然语言的视觉描述中受益，又能从直接操作的空间精确性中受益。",
