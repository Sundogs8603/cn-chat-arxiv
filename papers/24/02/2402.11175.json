In this work, we address this problem by introducing a new benchmark involving multilingual, multi-domain and multi-generator for MGT detection -- M4GT-Bench. It is collected for three task formulations: (1) mono-lingual and multi-lingual binary MGT detection; (2) multi-way detection identifies which particular model generates the text; and (3) human-machine mixed text detection, where a word boundary delimiting MGT from human-written content should be determined.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现带来了机器生成文本（MGT）在不同渠道的激增，这引发了人们对其潜在滥用和社会影响的关注。识别和区分这种内容与真实人类生成的文本对于对抗虚假信息、保持教育和科学领域的完整性以及保持通信信任至关重要。本文通过引入一个涉及多语言、多领域和多生成器的新基准M4GT-Bench来解决这一问题。它针对三个任务提出了不同的集合：（1）单语和多语种二分类MGT检测；（2）多模型检测确定生成文本的特定模型；以及（3）人机混合文本检测，应确定一个词边界来界定MGT和人工撰写内容。对于任务2的人类评估显示",
