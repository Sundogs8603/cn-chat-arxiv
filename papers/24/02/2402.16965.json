    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.16965v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: With the fast development of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven Web Agents (Web Agents for short) have obtained tons of attention due to their superior capability where LLMs serve as the core part of making decisions like the human brain equipped with multiple web tools to actively interact with external deployed websites. As uncountable Web Agents have been released and such LLM systems are experiencing rapid development and drawing closer to widespread deployment in our daily lives, an essential and pressing question arises: \"Are these Web Agents secure?\". In this paper, we introduce a novel threat, WIPI, that indirectly controls Web Agent to execute malicious instructions embedded in publicly accessible webpages. To launch a successful WIPI works in a black-box environment. This methodology focuses on the form and content of indirect instructions within external webpages, enhancing the efficiency and stealthiness of the attack",

    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展，LLM驱动的Web代理（简称Web代理）由于其优越的能力而受到广泛关注，其中LLMs作为决策的核心部分，类似于人脑，配备了多个网络工具，可以与外部部署的网站进行积极交互。随着无数Web代理的发布，这种LLM系统正在快速发展，并且逐渐接近在我们日常生活中的广泛部署，一个重要而迫切的问题出现了：“这些Web代理安全吗？”在本文中，我们介绍了一种新型威胁WIPI，它间接控制Web代理执行嵌入在公开可访问网页中的恶意指令。为了成功启动WIPI，需要在黑盒环境中工作。这种方法关注于外部网页中间接指令的形式和内容，增强了攻击的效率和隐蔽性。",
