    "translated_abstract": "随着生成式人工智能技术（如大型语言模型LLMs）日益普及，对创意工作有着重要的影响。本文探讨了将LLMs整合到创意过程中的两个方面 - 创意生成的分歧阶段以及评估和选择想法的收敛阶段。我们设计了一个协作的团体-AI头脑写作构思框架，将LLM作为一个增强因素融入到团体构思过程中，并评估了创意生成过程和结果解空间。为评估在想法评估过程中使用LLMs的潜力，我们设计了一个评估引擎，并将其与三名专家和六名新手评估者分配的想法评级进行了比较。我们的发现表明，将LLMs整合到头脑写作中可以增强构思过程及其结果。我们还提供了LLMs可以支持想法评估的证据。最后，我们讨论了相关的启示。",
