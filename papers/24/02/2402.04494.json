    "translated_abstract": "最新的机器学习的突破性成功主要归功于规模化，即基于注意力的大规模架构和空前规模的数据集。本文研究了对国际象棋的大规模训练的影响。与传统的依赖复杂启发式算法、显式搜索或二者结合的国际象棋引擎不同，我们通过在1000万局国际象棋对局的数据集上使用监督学习训练了一个拥有2.7亿参数的Transformer模型。我们用强大的Stockfish 16引擎提供的动作值来注释数据集中的每个棋局，产生大约150亿个数据点。我们最大的模型在Lichess闪电战Elo上达到了2895，成功解决了一系列具有挑战性的国际象棋谜题，而无需任何特定领域的调整或显式搜索算法。我们还证明了我们的模型优于AlphaZero的策略和价值网络（无MCTS）以及GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct。对模型和数据集规模的系统研究表明，强大的国际象棋对局可以在规模上取得最佳效果。",
