    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.18959v1 公告类型：交叉 摘要：股票市场在经济发展中发挥着至关重要的作用，然而其复杂的波动性给投资者带来了挑战。因此，对股价走势的研究和准确预测对于减轻风险至关重要。传统时间序列模型在捕捉非线性方面表现不佳，导致股票预测效果不佳。这种局限性推动了神经网络在股票预测中的广泛应用，因为它们具有强大的非线性泛化能力。最近，Mamba，一种带有选择机制和扫描模块（S6）的结构化状态空间序列模型，在序列建模任务中表现出色。利用这一框架，本文提出了一种基于Mamba的股价预测模型，名为MambaStock。所提出的MambaStock模型有效地挖掘历史股市数据，以在没有手工特征或繁琐预处理的情况下预测未来的股价。",
