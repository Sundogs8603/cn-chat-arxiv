When a model has been trained on a dataset containing such errors its performance is reduced. This leads to the challenge of efficiently unlearning the influence of the erroneous data to improve the model performance without needing to completely retrain the model. While model editing methods exist for cases in which the correct label for a wrong entry is known, we focus on the case of data entry errors where we do not know the correct labels for the erroneous data. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce an extension to the selective synaptic dampening unlearning method that removes the need for parameter tuning, making unlearning accessible to practitioners. We demonstrate the performance of this extension, adaptive selective synaptic dampening (ASSD), on various ResNet18 and Visio",

    "translated_abstract": "数据输入是机器学习流程的基本组成部分，但经常会导致引入标签错误。当模型在包含这种错误的数据集上进行训练时，其性能会降低。因此，需要有效地去除错误数据的影响以提高模型性能，而无需完全重新训练模型。虽然在已知错误条目的正确标签的情况下存在模型编辑方法，但我们专注于无法知道错误数据的正确标签的数据输入错误情况。我们的贡献有两个方面。首先，我们引入了对选择性突触抑制unlearning方法的扩展，该方法不需要参数调整，使unlearning方法对从业人员更易于使用。我们展示了这一扩展自适应选择性突触抑制（ASSD）在不同的ResNet18和Visio模型上的性能。",
