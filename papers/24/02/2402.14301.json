In this paper, we propose GenSERP, a framework that leverages LLMs with vision in a few-shot setting to dynamically organize intermediate search results, including generated chat answers, website snippets, multimedia data, knowledge panels into a coherent SERP layout based on a user's query. Our approach has three main stages: (1) An information gathering phase where the LLM continuously orchestrates API tools to retrieve different types of items, and proposes candidate layouts based on the retrieved items, until it's confident enough to generate the final result. (2) An answer generation phase where the LLM populates the layouts with the retrieved content. In this phase, the LLM adaptively optimize the ranking of items and UX configurations of the SERP.
