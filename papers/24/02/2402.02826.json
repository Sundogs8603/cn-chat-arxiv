    "translated_abstract": "在应对紧急医疗危机（如流行病或生物恐怖主义事件）时，快速开发疾病检测的计算机视觉模型非常重要。然而，传统的数据收集方法对于这些场景来说太慢了，需要创新方法从很少的数据中快速生成可靠的模型。我们通过仅使用合成数据构建了一个全面的计算机视觉模型来检测人类乳头瘤病毒生殖器疣，展示了我们的新方法。在我们的研究中，我们采用了一个两阶段的实验设计，使用扩散模型。在第一阶段，扩散模型被用于从10张HPV引导图像生成大量多样的合成图像，专注于准确描绘生殖器疣。第二阶段涉及使用该合成数据集对视觉模型进行训练和测试。这种方法旨在评估扩散模型在快速生成高质量训练数据方面的有效性以及对视觉模型的影响。",
