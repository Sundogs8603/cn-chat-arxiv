    "translated_abstract": "为了优化癌症治疗中的放疗，特别是在处理复杂照射如全骨髓和淋巴结照射(TMLI)时，准确勾画照射计划靶体积(PTV)至关重要。不幸的是，对于这种治疗，依赖手工勾画耗时且容易出错。本文研究了将深度学习(DL)应用于自动分割TMLI治疗中的PTV，建立在先前基于2D U-Net模型的解决方案上。我们扩展了之前的研究(i)通过使用nnU-Net框架开发了2D和3D U-Net模型，(ii)通过将骨骼排除在外评估了训练好的模型在PTV上的表现，骨骼主要包含淋巴结，是最具挑战的区域。我们的结果显示nnU-Net框架的引入在分割性能上有统计上显著的提升。",
