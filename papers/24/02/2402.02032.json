    "translated_abstract": "时间序列预测是许多实际应用中重要而前沿的任务。然而，大多数时间序列预测技术假设训练数据没有异常值，这种假设在实践中是不现实的，因为收集的时间序列数据可能被污染。如果直接使用带有异常值的时间序列进行训练，预测模型将表现较差。因此，从受污染数据中自动学习鲁棒的预测模型是至关重要的。本文首先对三种异常进行了统计定义，然后在这些异常存在时从理论和实验上分析了损失鲁棒性和样本鲁棒性。基于我们的分析，我们提出了一种简单高效的算法来学习一个鲁棒的预测模型。广泛的实验表明我们的方法具有很高的鲁棒性，并且优于所有现有方法。代码可在https://github.com/haochenglouis/RobustTSF获取。",
