    "translated_abstract": "深度学习为新视角合成这个老问题提供了丰富的新方法，从基于神经辐射场（NeRF）的方法到端到端的风格架构。每种方法都具有特定的优势，但也具有特定的适用性限制。这项工作引入了ViewFusion，这是一种具有无与伦比的灵活性的最新端到端生成方法，用于新视角合成。ViewFusion同时对场景的任意数量的输入视角应用扩散去噪步骤，然后将每个视角得到的噪声梯度与（推断得到的）像素加权掩模相结合，确保对于目标场景的每个区域，只考虑最具信息量的输入视角。我们的方法通过以下方式解决了先前方法的几个局限性：（1）可训练且能够泛化到多个场景和物体类别，（2）在训练和测试时自适应地采用可变数量的无姿态视图，（3）生成高质量的合成图像。",
