    "translated_abstract": "相对于其他模式，基于脑电图的情绪识别可以直观地响应人脑中的情绪模式，因此成为脑-计算机接口领域最关注的任务之一。由于大脑区域之间的依赖与情绪密切相关，因此发展基于图神经网络（GNNs）进行基于脑电图的情绪识别成为一个重要趋势。然而，情绪性脑电图中的大脑区域依赖具有生理基础，使得在这一领域中的GNNs与其他时间序列领域的GNNs有所区别。此外，在基于脑电图的情绪识别中既没有全面的综述，也没有构建GNNs的指导。在这项综述中，我们对已有方法在图构造的统一框架下进行了分类，揭示出其共同点和差异。我们从框架的三个阶段分析和分类方法，为构建基于脑电图的GNNs提供了清晰的指导。此外，我们还讨论了一些...",
