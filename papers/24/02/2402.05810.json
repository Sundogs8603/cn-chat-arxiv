    "translated_abstract": "当前最先进的推荐系统主要依赖于用户的隐式或显式反馈来建议新项目。虽然在推荐新选项方面有效，但这些传统系统通常使用不可解释的嵌入。这种缺乏透明度不仅限制了用户对为什么建议某些项目的理解，还减少了用户轻松审查和编辑其偏好的能力。为了解决这些限制，我们引入了一种新的方法，利用用户评价来创建描述用户偏好的个性化自然语言配置文件。通过这些描述性配置文件，我们的系统提供透明的自然语言推荐。我们的评估结果表明，这种新方法在与已建立的推荐系统相当的性能水平上。",

By implementing this approach, our system is able to provide transparent recommendations in natural language, while maintaining a performance level on par with conventional recommender systems."
