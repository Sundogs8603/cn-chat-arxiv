    "translated_abstract": "概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）旨在通过将特征和标签与人类可理解的概念联系起来，提供可解释和可干预的预测。尽管最近的CBMs显示出了巨大的潜力，但它们存在信息泄漏问题，即在概念表示为概率或二进制状态时，超出概念的意图信息泄漏到后续的标签预测中。因此，通过无法区分的概念来错误分类不同的类别，削弱了CBMs的解释和干预能力。本文通过在概念预测中引入标签监督和构建分层概念集来缓解信息泄漏问题。因此，我们提出了一种新的CBMs范例，即SupCBM，它通过预测的概念和精心设计的干预矩阵实现标签预测。SupCBM将重点放在与预测标签最相关的概念上，并且仅在不同的类别之间进行区分。",
