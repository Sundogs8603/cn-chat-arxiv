    "translated_abstract": "启发式在SAT求解器中至关重要，然而，并没有适用于所有问题实例的启发式规则。因此，通常需要为特定问题实例优化特定求解器。在这种情况下，我们提出了AutoSAT，这是一个新颖的框架，用于自动优化SAT求解器中的启发式。AutoSAT基于大型语言模型（LLMs），能够自动生成代码，进行评估，然后利用反馈进一步优化启发式，从而减少人为干预，增强求解器能力。AutoSAT基于即插即用的方式运行，消除了对广泛的初步设置和模型训练的需求，并促进了一种带有容错能力的思维链协作过程，确保启发式优化的稳健性。对使用冲突驱动子句学习（CDCL）求解器的广泛实验表明AutoSAT的整体性能优越，特别在解决某些特定的SAT问题时。",
