    "translated_abstract": "随着城市的不断蓬勃发展，城市计算作为一门关键学科，通过利用来自各种来源（如地理、交通、社交媒体和环境数据）和模态（如时空、视觉和文本模态）的跨领域数据融合的力量，成为可持续发展的关键。最近，我们正在见证一种利用各种深度学习方法促进智慧城市中的跨领域数据融合的趋势。为此，我们提出了第一份系统地回顾了专门为城市计算量身定制的基于深度学习的数据融合方法的最新进展的调查。具体而言，我们首先深入研究数据视角，以理解每种模态和数据来源的作用。其次，我们将方法论分类为四大主要类别：基于特征、基于对齐、基于对比和基于生成的融合方法。第三，我们进一步对多模态城市应用进行分类。",
