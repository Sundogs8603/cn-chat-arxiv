To support this, MOMo organizes organizes ontology design patterns into design libraries, which are programmatically queryable, to support accelerated ontology development, for both human and automated processes. However, a major bottleneck to large-scale deployment of MOMo is the (to-date) limited availability of ready-to-use ontology design patterns. At the same time, Large Language Models have quickly become a source of common knowledge and, in some cases, replacing search engines for questions. In this paper, we thus present a collection of 104 ontology design patterns representing often occurring nouns, curated from the common-sense knowledge available in LLMs, organized into a fully-annotated modular ontology design library ready for use with MOMo.",

    "translated_abstract": "先前引入的模块本体建模方法（MOMo）试图通过使用模块化模式来拼凑更复杂的概念，以模仿人类类比过程。为了支持这一点，MOMo将本体设计模式组织到设计库中，这些设计库可以通过程序查询，以支持加速本体开发，适用于人类和自动化流程。然而，MOMo大规模部署的一个主要瓶颈是（迄今为止）准备就绪的本体设计模式的有限可用性。与此同时，大型语言模型已迅速成为通识知识的来源，在某些情况下取代搜索引擎回答问题。因此，在本文中，我们提出了一套包含104个本体设计模式的集合，这些模式代表常见的名词，从大型语言模型中的常识知识中策划，组织成一个注释完整的模块化本体设计库，可与MOMo一起使用。",
