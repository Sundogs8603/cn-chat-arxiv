    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习（FL）是一种隐私保护的分布式学习方法，在隐私保护日益重视的时代迅速发展。正是这种快速发展趋势，以及现实世界中对联邦学习的不断新需求的出现，促使我们专注于一个非常重要的问题：具有新知识的联邦学习。主要挑战在于如何将各种新知识有效地融入现有的FL系统中，并使这些系统降低成本，延长寿命，并促进可持续发展。在本文中，我们系统地定义了FL中新知识的主要来源，包括新特征、任务、模型和算法。对于每个来源，我们深入分析和讨论如何将新知识纳入现有的FL系统，并研究新知识到达的形式和时间对纳入过程的影响。此外，我们全面讨论了联邦学习具有新知识时的潜在未来发展方向。",
