LLMs are used to translate between the surface form of the conversation and a domain-specific language (DSL) which is used to progress the business logic. We compare our approach to the intent-based NLU approach predominantly used in industry today. Our experiments show that developing chatbots with our system requires significantly less effort than established approaches, that these chatbots can successfully navigate complex dialogues which are extremely challenging for NLU-based systems, and that our system has desirable properties for scaling task-oriented dialogue systems to a large number of tasks. We make our implementation available for use and further study.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们描述了一个结合大型语言模型（LLM）的上下文学习能力和确定性执行业务逻辑的任务型对话系统构建系统。LLM用于在表面形式的对话和特定领域语言（DSL）之间进行翻译，后者用于推进业务逻辑。我们将我们的方法与当前工业中主要使用的基于意图的自然语言理解（NLU）方法进行比较。我们的实验表明，使用我们的系统开发聊天机器人需要的工作量明显少于已建立的方法，这些聊天机器人能够成功地处理对基于NLU系统极具挑战性的复杂对话，并且我们的系统具有可扩展任务型对话系统到大量任务的理想性能。我们提供我们的实现供使用和进一步研究。",
