We consider how people can learn which opinions to trust in such scenarios by extending the hedge algorithm: a classic solution for learning from diverse information sources. We first introduce a semi-supervised variant we call the delusional hedge capable of learning from both supervised and unsupervised experiences. In two experiments, we examine the alignment between human judgments and predictions from the standard hedge, the delusional hedge, and a heuristic baseline model.

    "translated_abstract": "认知学习模型通常假设直接体验事件的特征和真实标签或结果，但大部分日常学习来源于听取他人观点，没有直接接触体验或准确结果。我们通过扩展对冲算法来考虑人们在这种场景下如何学会信任哪些观点：这是一个经典解决方案，用于从不同信息源学习。我们首次引入了一个我们称之为妄想对冲的半监督变体，它能够从监督和无监督经验中学习。通过两个实验，我们检验了人类判断和标准对冲、妄想对冲以及启发式基线模型预测之间的一致性。结果表明，人类有效地结合了标记和未标记信息，与妄想对冲算法一致地学习——这表明人类学习者",
