    "translated_abstract": "自适应时间序列预测对于在制度变化下进行预测是至关重要的。许多传统方法假设具有在时间上恒定的方差的线性高斯状态空间模型（LGSSM）。然而，许多现实世界的过程不能被这样的模型捕捉。我们考虑具有马尔可夫切换方差的状态空间模型。这样的动态系统通常是无法解决的，因为它们的计算复杂性随时间呈指数增长；变分贝叶斯（VB）技术已被应用于解决此问题。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于在线学习理论的新的估计方差的方法；我们调整专家聚合方法来随时间学习方差。我们将提出的方法应用于合成数据以及用于电量负荷预测的问题。我们展示了这种方法对于误差估计的稳健性，并优于传统的专家聚合方法。",
