    "abstract": "We evaluate the effects of bundling demand for broadband internet by K-12 schools. In 2014, New Jersey switched from decentralized procurements to a new procurement system that bundled schools into four regional groups. Using an event study approach, we find that, on average, prices for participants decreased by one-third, and broadband speed purchased increased sixfold. We bound the change in school expenditures due to the program and find that participants saved at least as much as their total \"E-rate\" subsidy from the federal government. Under weak assumptions on demand, we show that participating schools experienced large welfare gains.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们评估了K-12学校通过捆绑需求获得宽带互联网的效果。2014年，新泽西州从分散的采购方式转变为将学校分为四个区域组合的新采购系统。采用事件研究方法，我们发现参与者的价格平均下降了三分之一，购买的宽带速度增加了六倍。我们对该计划导致的学校支出变化进行了界定，发现参与者节省的金额至少等于他们从联邦政府获得的\"E-rate\"补贴总额。在对需求进行弱假设的情况下，我们表明参与学校获得了巨大的福利提升。",
