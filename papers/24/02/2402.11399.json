    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11399v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Recent watermarked generation algorithms inject detectable signatures during language generation to facilitate post-hoc detection. While token-level watermarks are vulnerable to paraphrase attacks, SemStamp (Hou et al., 2023) applies watermark on the semantic representation of sentences and demonstrates promising robustness. SemStamp employs locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to partition the semantic space with arbitrary hyperplanes, which results in a suboptimal tradeoff between robustness and speed. We propose k-SemStamp, a simple yet effective enhancement of SemStamp, utilizing k-means clustering as an alternative of LSH to partition the embedding space with awareness of inherent semantic structure. Experimental results indicate that k-SemStamp saliently improves its robustness and sampling efficiency while preserving the generation quality, advancing a more effective tool for machine-generated text detection.",

    "translated_abstract": "最近的水印生成算法在语言生成过程中注入可检测的签名，以便进行事后检测。虽然基于标记级别的水印容易受到改写攻击，但SemStamp (Hou等人，2023)在句子的语义表示上应用水印，并展示出很好的鲁棒性。SemStamp利用局部敏感哈希（LSH）来利用任意超平面对语义空间进行分区，导致在鲁棒性和速度之间存在次优的权衡。我们提出k-SemStamp，这是SemStamp的一个简单而有效的增强版，利用k均值聚类作为局部敏感哈希的替代方案，以了解内在的语义结构来分区嵌入空间。实验结果表明，k-SemStamp显著提高了其鲁棒性和抽样效率，同时保持生成质量，推进了更有效的机器生成文本检测工具。",
