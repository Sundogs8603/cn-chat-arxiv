    "translated_abstract": "贝叶斯优化是一种高效的黑盒优化器，通过概率替代模型建立黑盒函数的绝对函数响应。已经提出了许多方法来构建这种模型，包括基于树结构的Parzen估计方法(TPE)、随机森林(SMAC)和高斯过程(GP)。然而，很少有方法来估计候选项的相对排名，相对排名可以比绝对函数响应更具鲁棒性，并且在函数响应难以处理但偏好可以获取时更具实用性。为此，我们提出了一种基于泊松过程的新型排名替代模型，并引入了一种高效的BO框架，称为泊松过程贝叶斯优化(PoPBO)。进一步从经典的LCB和EI模型中得出了两个定制的收集函数以适应它。与经典的GP-BO方法相比，我们的PoPBO计算成本较低，对噪声具有更好的鲁棒性。",
