    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了Banerjee等人（2022年）最近提出的具有预测的图搜索问题。在这个问题中，一个从某个顶点$r$出发的代理者必须在最小化总行程的同时遍历一个（潜在未知的）图$G$以找到隐藏的目标节点$g$。我们研究了一种设置，在这种设置中，在任意节点$v$处，代理者会接收到到$g$的距离的噪声估计。我们设计了针对未知图的这种搜索任务的算法。我们在未知加权图上建立了第一次形式保证，并提供了显示我们提出的算法在预测误差上具有最优或几乎最佳依存关系的下界。此外，我们进行了数值实验，证明我们的算法除了对抗性误差具有鲁棒性外，还在误差是随机的典型实例中表现良好。最后，我们提供了对Banerjee等人算法的替代简化性能界限。",
