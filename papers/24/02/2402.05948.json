Purposefully, we leverage prototypical networks to learn class prototypes and devise a distance metric between samples and class prototypes.

    "translated_abstract": "早期停止方法通过动态调整执行的层数，提高了像BERT这样的预训练语言模型的推断速度。然而，大多数早期停止方法仅考虑了来自单个测试样本的局部信息来确定早期停止的指标，而未利用样本群体提供的全局信息。这导致对预测正确性的估计不够准确，从而产生错误的早期停止决策。为了弥合这个差距，我们探索了有效结合局部和全局信息以确保可靠的早期停止的必要性。为此，我们利用原型网络学习类别原型，并设计了样本和类别原型之间的距离度量。这使我们能够利用全局信息来估计早期预测的正确性。基于此，我们提出了一种新颖的DE$^3$-BERT增强距离早期停止框架。",
