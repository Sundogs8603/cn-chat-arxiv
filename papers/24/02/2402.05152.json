    "abstract": "Price perception by consumers represents a challenge to the ability of a business to correctly and profitably price and sell their products or services in a given market and any new target market. Complicating the perception of prices is the dynamics of price and income elasticity and the heterogeneity of consumer preferences. This article proposes a novel metric that conceptualizes elasticity as a means of generally quantifying the potential for price perception problems in a market using an elegant and non-utility based identity. The results suggest that given known price and income elasticity values, a business can anticipate pricing perception problems in advance and address the potential for the damaging distortion of their value proposition.

    "translated_abstract": "消费者对价格的感知对于企业能否正确和盈利地为其产品或服务定价和销售构成了挑战，特别是在特定市场和新的目标市场上。价格感知的复杂性在于价格和收入弹性的动态性以及消费者偏好的异质性。本文提出了一种新颖的度量标准，以将弹性概念化为一种在市场上一般量化潜在价格感知问题的方法，使用一种优雅且非效用基础的身份认同。结果表明，根据已知的价格和收入弹性值，企业可以事先预测定价感知问题，并解决其价值主张可能遭受的破坏性失真。此外，企业可以利用这一洞察力来正确选择战略定价方法。",
