    "translated_abstract": "在生物研究领域中，理解分子序列的特征和功能是至关重要的。分子序列的分类已经广泛使用基于神经网络的技术。尽管这些模型的准确性令人惊讶，但它们往往需要大量的参数和更多的数据收集。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种基于压缩模型的新方法，该方法受到\\cite{jiang2023low}的启发，将基本压缩算法（如Gzip和Bz2）的简单性与标准化压缩距离（NCD）算法相结合，以在分类任务上实现更好的性能，而不依赖于手工特征或预训练模型。首先，我们使用众所周知的压缩算法（如Gzip和Bz2）对分子序列进行压缩。通过利用压缩文件中编码的潜在结构，我们计算出每对分子序列之间的标准化压缩距离，该距离是从压缩距离推导出的。",
