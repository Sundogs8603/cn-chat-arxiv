    "translated_abstract": "模拟基础的校准（SBC）应用于分析两种常用、竞争的马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛算法，用于估计随机波动模型的后验分布。具体来说，探讨了由Kim，Shephard和Chib（1998）提出的定制的“偏移混合逼近”算法，以及通过Stan实现的Hamilton蒙特卡洛算法。SBC分析涉及模拟研究，以评估每个采样算法是否能够为正确指定的模型产生有效推断，同时通过有效样本量来描述统计效率。结果表明，Stan的No-U-Turn采样器，即Hamilton蒙特卡洛的一种实现，产生了一个良好校准的后验估计，而备受赞誉的偏移混合方法效率较低，并校准不佳，尽管模型参数化也起着一定作用。",
