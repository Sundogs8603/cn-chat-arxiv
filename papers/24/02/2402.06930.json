    "translated_abstract": "在文本生成领域不断发展的过程中，对更精确的控制机制的需求变得越来越明显。为了满足这一需求，我们提出了一种新的方法LIFI，它提供了一种轻量级的方式，使用精细控制代码进行可控文本生成。不同于以前的研究将预训练语言模型训练来遵循离散、分类和互斥的控制代码，LIFI在连续、相对和非排他的控制代码的引导下学习可控文本生成。这些精细的代码是通过属性分类器自动导出的，它最初使用少量的标记数据进行训练，然后用来标记大量的未标记数据，从而获得了更广泛的监督信号。此外，为了实现高效的控制，我们将精细控制代码与适配器相结合，适配器是一种参数和计算效率高的方法，用于引导预训练的语言模型。我们对LIFI在两个传统任务中进行了评估--句子生成和文本分类--并取得了良好的性能。",
