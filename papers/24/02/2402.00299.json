    "translated_abstract": "传统的信用评分倾向于仅使用个体借款人或贷款级别的预测因素，然而长期以来，人们认识到借款人之间的关联可能会导致风险在网络上的传播。本文提出了一种利用由图神经网络和循环神经网络构建的动态多层网络的模型，用于信用风险评估，其中每一层反映了不同来源的网络连接。我们使用美国抵押贷款公司Freddie Mac提供的数据集，在行为信用评分的背景下测试了我们的方法，其中不同类型的连接源自借款人的地理位置和他们选择的抵押贷款提供商。所提出的模型考虑了这两种连接以及这些连接随时间的演变。我们通过使用自定义的注意力机制来增强模型，根据其重要性对不同的时间快照进行加权。经过多次配置测试后，",
