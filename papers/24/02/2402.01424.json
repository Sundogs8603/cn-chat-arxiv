    "translated_abstract": "由于新的数据集和建模技术，自动钢琴转录算法在近年来得到了显著的改进。最近的研究主要集中在采用新的神经网络架构，如Transformer和Perceiver，以获得更准确的系统。在本研究中，我们从训练数据的角度研究了转录系统。通过在分布外的带注释钢琴数据上衡量它们的性能，我们展示了这些模型如何严重过拟合训练数据的声学特性。我们在MAESTRO数据集上创建了一组新的音频数据，在专业录音环境中通过Yamaha Disklavier播放进行了自动捕获。在使用原始和重新演奏版本的MAESTRO数据集进行训练时，采用了各种数据增强技术，我们在MAPS数据集上实现了88.4的F1得分的最新音符起始准确性，而不需要查看其任何训练数据。随后，我们对这些数据进行了进一步的分析。",
