    "translated_abstract": "爆炸式的预测AI在现代芯片物理设计流程中实现了快速而有效的评估和决策。现有的最先进框架通常包括最小化预测与真实值之间的均方误差（MSE）的目标。我们认为MSE的平均效果导致模型训练和部署两方面都存在局限性，而良好的MSE行为不能保证这些模型在可能由于少量预测误差而受损的物理设计流程中的能力。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了迷你像素批量梯度下降（MPGD），这是一种即插即用的优化算法，它考虑了最具信息量的条目，可能提供更快更好的收敛性。在代表性基准套件上的实验表明，MPGD在使用CNN或基于图的模型进行各种物理设计预测任务时具有显著的优势。",
