    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种任务中取得了显著进展，包括数学推理和定理证明。由于这两个任务需要严格和形式化的多步推理，它们是探索LLMs推理能力的吸引领域，但仍面临重要挑战。以前的研究如Chain-of-Thought（CoT）揭示了中间步骤指导的有效性。然而，这种逐步注释需要大量的劳动力，导致当前基准测试的训练步骤不足。为了填补这一空白，本研究引入了MUSTARD，一种数据生成框架，可以主导高质量和多样化的定理和证明数据的统一合成。MUSTARD通过三个阶段合成数据：（1）它随机选择几个数学概念作为问题的类别。（2）然后，它使用选定的概念提示生成性语言模型，以获得问题和它们的推理步骤。",
