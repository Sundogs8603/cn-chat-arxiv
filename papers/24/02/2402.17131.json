    "translated_abstract": "糖基化是一种蛋白质修饰，在功能和结构上起着多种重要作用。O-GlcNAcylation是糖基化的一种亚型，有潜力成为治疗的重要靶点，但在2023年之前尚未有可靠预测O-GlcNAcylation位点的方法；2021年的一篇评论正确指出已发表的模型不足，并且未能泛化。此外，许多模型已不再可用。2023年，一篇具有F$_1$分数36.17%和MCC分数34.57%的大型数据集上的显着更好的RNN模型被发表。本文首次试图通过Transformer编码器提高这些指标。尽管Transformer在该数据集上表现出色，但其性能仍不及先前发表的RNN。然后我们创建了一种新的损失函数，称为加权焦点可微MCC，以提高分类模型的性能。",
