    "translated_abstract": "现代调度系统的一个重要目标是高效管理能源使用。在能效调度中，操作系统控制着机器处理作业的速度，以最小化能量消耗并优化所得调度的服务质量成本。由于机器学习关于未来请求的预测通常可以从历史数据中学习到，最近一系列关于学习增强算法的工作旨在通过利用预测来实现改进的性能保证。特别是，针对能效调度，Bamas et. al. [BamasMRS20] 和 Antoniadis et. al. [antoniadis2021novel] 设计了带有预测的算法，用于能量最小化与截止时间问题，并在预测误差较小时实现了改进的竞争比率，即使在预测误差任意大时也能保持最坏情况下的界限。",
