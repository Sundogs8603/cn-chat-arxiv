    "translated_abstract": "路径签名作为一种在机器学习领域取得成功的理论驱动方法，用于从不规则路径中提取特征。另一方面，图神经网络（GNN）是一种用于处理图数据的神经网络架构，在传感器网络等不规则领域的任务中表现出色。本文介绍了一种新颖的方法，路径签名图卷积神经网络（PS-GCNN），将路径签名与图卷积神经网络（GCNN）结合起来，发挥了路径签名的特征提取能力和GCNN处理空间互动的优势。我们将该方法应用于慢地震序列（也称为慢滑事件）的分析，利用来自GPS时间序列的数据，在新西兰北岛东海岸的GPS传感器网络上进行了案例研究。我们还在模拟随机微分方程中建立了我们方法的基准，这种模型模拟了类似的反应扩散现象。",
