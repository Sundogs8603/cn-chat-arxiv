    "translated_abstract": "在估计过程中，识别噪声数据中的对应关系是一个非常重要的步骤。当有一个有信息的初始估计猜测可用时，数据关联的挑战就不那么严重；然而，在大多数情况下，很少有高质量的初始猜测。我们探索了基于图的数据关联形式，不需要初始估计猜测。现有的基于图的方法优化无权图，丢弃了权重边中编码的重要一致性信息，并经常尝试精确解决NP困难问题。相比之下，我们提出了一个新的优化问题，充分利用加权图，并寻求最密集的加权点团。我们对这个问题引入了两个松弛条件：一个凸半定松弛，我们发现在实际中很紧密；以及一个快速的一阶算法CLIPPER，通常可以在毫秒级别内得到接近最优解。在点云注册方面的评估中，我们的方法显示出了很大的优势和性能提升。",
