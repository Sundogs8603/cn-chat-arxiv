    "translated_abstract": "在多个域上变化的初始/边界条件下求解偏微分方程的解在各种应用中都是需要的，但是如果每次域的初始/边界条件变化时都重新计算解，计算成本很高。我们引入了一个通用的算子学习框架，称为DIffeomorphic Mapping Operator LearNing（DIMON），用来学习解在域族$\\{\\Omega_{\\theta}}_\\theta$上的近似解，它学习从初始/边界条件和域$\\Omega_\\theta$到偏微分方程的解（或指定的函数）的映射。DIMON基于将给定问题（初始/边界条件和域$\\Omega_{\\theta}$）转移到一个参考域$\\Omega_{0}$上进行处理，其中使用来自多个问题的训练数据来学习到在$\\Omega_{0}$上的解的映射，然后再将其重新映射回原始域$\\Omega_{\\theta}$。我们考虑了几个问题来展示该框架的性能。",
