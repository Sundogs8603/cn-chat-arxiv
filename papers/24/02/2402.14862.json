    "translated_abstract": "Scalable Service-Oriented Middleware over IP（SOME/IP）是汽车开放系统架构（AUTOSAR）中的以太网通信标准协议，促进ECU与ECU之间通过IP堆栈进行通信。然而，SOME/IP缺乏健壮的安全架构，容易受到潜在攻击。此外，ECU的随机硬件故障会破坏SOME/IP通信。本文提出了SISSA，一种基于SOME/IP通信流量的方法，用于建模和分析车载功能安全和网络安全。具体而言，SISSA使用Weibull分布对硬件故障进行建模，并解决包括分布式拒绝服务、中间人和异常通信流程在内的五种潜在SOME/IP通信攻击，假设恶意用户访问车载网络。随后，SISSA设计了一系列具有不同主干结构的深度学习模型，用于从SOM中提取特征。",
