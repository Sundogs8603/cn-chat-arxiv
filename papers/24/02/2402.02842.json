    "translated_abstract": "在推荐系统中的兴趣建模一直是改善用户体验的一个重要领域，许多现有工作已经研究了典型的兴趣建模任务（例如多兴趣、小众兴趣和长期兴趣）。然而，大多数研究只考虑了其中一个兴趣，并忽略了它们之间的相互关系。在本文中，我们认为这些任务面临共同的“兴趣遗忘”问题，而且存在一种解决方法可以同时减轻这个问题。我们认为长期线索可以成为基石，因为它们揭示了多种兴趣并澄清了小众兴趣。受到这个观察的启发，我们在检索阶段提出了一种新颖的统一框架“Trinity”，来解决兴趣遗忘问题并改善多兴趣建模任务。我们搭建了一个实时聚类系统，可以将物品投影到可枚举的簇中，并在这些簇上计算统计兴趣直方图。基于这些直方图，Trinity可以识别用户的兴趣，并进行个性化的推荐。",
