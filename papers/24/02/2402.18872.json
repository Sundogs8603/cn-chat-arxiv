For this purpose, we introduce a robust form of convex integral functionals on the space of bounded continuous functions on a Polish space, and establish some key regularity and representation results, in the spirit of the classical Rockafellar theorem, in terms of the duality formed with the space of Borel measures. These results (together with the standard Fenchel duality and minimax theorems) yield a duality for the robust utility maximisation problem as well as a representation of associated indifference prices, where the presence of static positions in the primal problem appears in the dual problem as a marginal constraint on the martingale measures. Consequently, the resulting indifference prices are consistent with the observed prices of vanilla options.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了具有半静态策略的离散时间鲁棒效用最大化，以及异国期权的相关等价价格。为此，我们在波兰空间上的有界连续函数空间引入了凸积分泛函的鲁棒形式，并建立了一些关键的正则性和表示结果，这些结果与经典的Rockafellar定理精神相符，以与Borel测度空间形成的对偶为基础。这些结果（与标准的Fenchel对偶和极小最大定理一起）产生了鲁棒效用最大化问题的对偶以及相关等价价格的表示，其中原始问题中静态头寸的存在在对偶问题中表现为对鞅测度的边际约束。因此，结果得到的等价价格与香草期权的观察价格一致。",
