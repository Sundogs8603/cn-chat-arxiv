    "translated_abstract": "过去20年里引入的谐振-放电（RF）神经元是一个简单、高效、且符合生物学可行性的尖峰神经元模型，由于其共振膜动力学，它可以在时间域内提取频率模式。然而，先前的RF公式存在固有缺陷，限制了有效学习并阻碍了RF神经元的原则优势的利用。在这里，我们介绍了平衡的RF（BRF）神经元，它缓解了普通RF神经元的一些固有限制，并展示了它在各种序列学习任务中在循环尖峰神经网络（RSNNs）中的有效性。我们表明，BRF神经元的网络实现了更高的任务性能，产生的脉冲仅为现代RSNNs的一小部分，并且相对于现代RSNNs，需要的参数明显更少。此外，BRF-RSNN始终提供更快速和更稳定的训练收敛，即使在连接多个时。",
