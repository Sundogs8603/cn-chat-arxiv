In this work, we focus on the novelty assessment under multi-modal generative models and attempt to answer the following question: Given the samples of a generative model $\\mathcal{G}$ and a reference dataset $\\mathcal{S}$, how can we discover and count the modes expressed by $\\mathcal{G}$ more frequently than in $\\mathcal{S}$.
