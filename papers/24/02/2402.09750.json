    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）在辅助编程方面的潜力被广泛使用。然而，当前的研究没有探索LLMs在艺术家与人工智能合作的创造性编程中的艺术潜力。我们的工作探索了在这种合作过程中艺术家的反思类型。我们比较了两种常见的合作方式：调用整个程序和多个子任务。我们的研究结果展示了艺术家在两种不同方法中不同的刺激性反思。我们的发现还显示了反思类型与用户表现、用户满意度和主观体验之间的相关性，通过进行两种方法，包括实验数据和定性访谈。在这个意义上，我们的工作揭示了LLM在创意编程中的艺术潜力。同时，我们从艺术家的角度提供了人工智能合作的批判性视角，并阐述了设计建议。",
