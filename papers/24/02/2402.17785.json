To solve this problem, we propose ByteComposer, an agent framework emulating a human's creative pipeline in four separate steps : \"Conception Analysis - Draft Composition - Self-Evaluation and Modification - Aesthetic Selection\". This framework seamlessly blends the interactive and knowledge-understanding features of LLMs with existing symbolic music generation models, thereby achieving a melody composition agent comparable to human creators.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（Large Language Models，LLM）在多模态理解和生成任务中取得了令人鼓舞的进展。然而，如何设计一个人类对齐且可解释的旋律创作系统仍未得到充分探讨。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了ByteComposer，一个代理框架，模拟人类创作的四个独立步骤：“概念分析 - 起草作品 - 自我评估和修改 - 美学选择”。该框架将LLM的交互和知识理解特性与现有的符号音乐生成模型无缝融合，从而实现了一个可与人类创作者媲美的旋律创作代理。我们在GPT4和几个开源大型语言模型上进行了大量实验，证实了我们框架的有效性。此外，专业音乐作曲家参与了多维度评估，最终结果表明，在各个方面",
