Our approach relies on generative AI models to transform a large volume of multimodal data (e.g., videos, articles, real-time scoring feeds, statistics, and fact sheets) into coherent and fluent text. Based on this approach, we introduce, for the first time, an AI commentary system, which was deployed to produce automated narrations for highlight packages at the 2023 US Open, Wimbledon, and Masters tournaments. In the same vein, our solution was extended to create personalized content for ESPN Fantasy Football and stories about music artists for the Grammy awards. These applications were built using a common software architecture achieved a 15x speed improvement with an average Rouge-L of 82.00 and perplexity of 6.6. Our work was successfully deployed at the aforeme",
