    "abstract": "A persistent challenge in the field of Intelligent Transportation Systems is to extract accurate traffic insights from geographic regions with scarce or no data coverage. To this end, we propose solutions for speed prediction using sparse GPS data points and their associated topographical and road design features. Our goal is to investigate whether we can use similarities in the terrain and infrastructure to train a machine learning model that can predict speed in regions where we lack transportation data. For this we create a Temporally Orientated Speed Dictionary Centered on Topographically Clustered Roads, which helps us to provide speed correlations to selected feature configurations. Our results show qualitative and quantitative improvement over new and standard regression methods. The presented framework provides a fresh perspective on devising strategies for missing data traffic analysis.",

    "translated_abstract": "在智能交通系统领域中，从数据稀缺或没有数据覆盖的地理区域中提取准确的交通信息一直是一个持久的挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了使用稀疏的GPS数据点及其相关的地形和道路设计特征进行速度预测的解决方案。我们的目标是研究是否可以利用地形和基础设施的相似性来训练一个可以预测缺乏交通数据区域速度的机器学习模型。为此，我们创建了一个以地形聚类道路为中心的时间导向速度字典，它帮助我们提供选定特征配置的速度相关性。我们的结果显示出对新的和标准回归方法的定性和定量改进。所提出的框架为缺失数据交通分析的制定策略提供了新的视角。",
