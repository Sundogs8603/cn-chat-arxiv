    "translated_abstract": "机器图像编码（ICM）旨在通过识别模型而不是人眼视觉来压缩图像以供机器分析。因此，在ICM中，编码器识别和压缩对于机器识别任务来说是至关重要的。学习型ICM有两种主要方法：基于任务损失的压缩模型优化和基于感兴趣区域（ROI）的比特分配。这些方法为编码器提供了识别能力。然而，当识别模型很深时，使用任务损失进行优化变得困难，而基于ROI的方法在评估过程中通常会增加额外开销。在本研究中，我们提出了一种用于学习型ICM模型的新训练方法，通过对编码器应用辅助损失来提高其识别能力和速率-失真性能。与传统训练方法相比，我们的方法在目标检测和语义分割任务中实现了27.7%和20.3%的Bjontegaard Delta速率改进。",
