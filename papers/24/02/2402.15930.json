Given that there is a significant differences in second language (L2) learners' error types by their proficiency levels, this paper attempts to reduce overcorrection by examining the interaction between LLM's performance and L2 language proficiency. Our method focuses on zero-shot and few-shot prompting and fine-tuning models for GEC for learners of English as a foreign language based on the different proficiency. We investigate GEC results and find that overcorrection happens primarily in advanced language learners' writing (proficiency C) rather than proficiency A (a beginner level) and proficiency B (an intermediate level). Fine-tuned LLMs, and even few-shot prompting with writing examples of English learners, actually tend to exhibit decreased recall measures.

    "translated_abstract": "英语学习者的写作范例可能与母语者不同。鉴于第二语言学习者根据其能力水平存在显著差异的错误类型，本文试图通过研究LLM的表现和第二语言能力之间的互动来减少过度纠正。我们的方法专注于针对不同能力水平的英语作为外语学习者进行零点和少点提示以及微调模型。我们调查了语法错误纠正的结果，发现过度纠正主要发生在高级语言学习者的写作（能力C）中，而并非在能力A（初学者水平）和能力B（中级水平）。经过微调的LLM甚至在少数提示的情况下，写作示例中的英语学习者实际上倾向于减少召回度量。为了使我们的论点具体化，我们对GEC结果进行了全面检查。",
