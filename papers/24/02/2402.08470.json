    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新颖的时空图神经网络驱动的趋势分析方法(ST-GTrend)，用于进行光伏电力网络的集群级性能衰减分析。光伏电站已成为全球可持续能源生产格局的重要组成部分。准确估计光伏系统的性能对于其作为发电技术和金融资产的可行性至关重要。评估光伏系统的水平化能源成本(LCOE)中最具挑战性的问题之一是了解和估计大规模光伏逆变器的长期性能损失率(PLR)。ST-GTrend集成了时空一致性和图注意力，将PLR作为长期的“老化”趋势与光伏输入数据中的多个波动项分离开来。为了应对时序中多样的衰减模式，ST-GTrend采用并行图自编码器数组同时提取老化和波动项。ST-GTrend发布了一个在线光伏衰减分析模型和数据集，以帮助学术界和工业界改进光伏系统的性能评估和可靠性分析。",
