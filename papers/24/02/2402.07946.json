    "translated_abstract": "未来的战争将要求在更复杂、快节奏、不结构化和极具挑战性的环境中进行指挥与控制（C2）决策。C2将因被拒绝、退化、间歇和有限的通信以及需要考虑到多个作战领域中的许多数据流而变得更加复杂。然而，当前的C2实践——源自工业时代而非新兴的智能时代——是线性的且耗时。而且，这些方法可能无法在未来战场上与对手保持优势。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种基于人工智能（AI）系统与人类之间强有力伙伴关系的未来C2愿景。这个未来愿景体现在三个运营影响上：优化C2操作流程，保持协同努力，以及发展自适应的集体知识系统。本文阐述了所设想的未来指挥与控制的愿景。",
