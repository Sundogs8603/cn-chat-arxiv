    "title": "Generating Diverse Translation with Perturbed kNN-MT",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.09344v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Generating multiple translation candidates would enable users to choose the one that satisfies their needs. Although there has been work on diversified generation, there exists room for improving the diversity mainly because the previous methods do not address the overcorrection problem -- the model underestimates a prediction that is largely different from the training data, even if that prediction is likely. This paper proposes methods that generate more diverse translations by introducing perturbed k-nearest neighbor machine translation (kNN-MT). Our methods expand the search space of kNN-MT and help incorporate diverse words into candidates by addressing the overcorrection problem. Our experiments show that the proposed methods drastically improve candidate diversity and control the degree of diversity by tuning the perturbation's magnitude.",

    "translated_abstract": "生成多个翻译候选能够让用户选择满足他们需求的翻译。尽管已经有了多样化生成的研究工作，但是仍然存在提高多样性的空间，主要原因是以往的方法未解决超校正问题——即模型低估一个与训练数据明显不同但可能正确的预测。本文通过引入扰动的k最近邻机器翻译（kNN-MT）来生成更多样化的翻译。我们的方法扩展了kNN-MT的搜索空间，并通过解决超校正问题将多样的词汇纳入候选集中。实验证明，所提出的方法显著提高了候选的多样性，并通过调整扰动的幅度控制多样性程度。",
