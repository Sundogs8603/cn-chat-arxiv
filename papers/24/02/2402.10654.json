    "translated_abstract": "数值推理是自然语言处理系统处理数值信息的必要能力。最近的研究表明，通过微调小规模模型，使其学习在回答问题的同时生成推理过程，可以显著提高性能。然而，当前方法的局限性在于大多数方法通过大型语言模型生成推理过程，这些过程“不可靠”，因为这种过程可能包含与答案无关的信息。为了解决这一限制，我们引入了Enhancing NumeriCal reasOning with Reliable procEsses (Encore)，通过分解答案公式得出可靠的推理过程，确保完全支持答案。然而，模型可能缺乏足够的数据来充分学习推理过程生成，因为我们的方法为一个公式只生成一个推理过程。为了克服这一困难，我们提出了一系列的预训练任务来h",
