    "translated_abstract": "治疗计划是放射治疗中一项耗时、资源密集的具体患者工作。剂量容积直方图（DVH）预测在自动化此过程中起到关键作用。放射治疗计划中DVH与风险器官（OAR）和计划靶体体积（PTV）的几何关系已经得到了很好的建立。本研究探讨了深度学习模型在使用图像和大型语言模型（LLM）促进人类干预以提高计划质量方面的潜力。我们提出了一种将非结构化图像转化为由图像块节点和剂量节点组成的结构化图的流程。我们开发了一种新颖的剂量图神经网络（DoseGNN）模型，用于从结构化图中预测DVH。所提出的DoseGNN通过LLM增强，以编码来自处方和临床医生的交互指示的大量知识。在本研究中，我们引入了一种在线人工智能协作（OHAC）系统。",
