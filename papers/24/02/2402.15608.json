Traditionally, oil and gas companies use simulation software that are inherently computationally expensive to forecast production. Thus, machine learning approaches are recently utilized in literature as an efficient alternative to optimize well developments by enhancing completion conditions. The primary goal of this project is to develop effective machine-learning models that can integrate the effects of multidimensional predictive variables (i.e., completion conditions) to predict 12-Month Cumulative Production accurately.
