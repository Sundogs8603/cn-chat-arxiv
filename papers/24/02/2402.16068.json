    "translated_abstract": "在人类共享空间部署机器人需要理解附近Agent和物体之间的交互。通过因果推理对因果关系建模有助于预测人类行为并预测机器人干预。然而，一个关键挑战是现有的因果发现方法目前缺乏在ROS生态系统内部的实现，这是机器人领域的事实标准，阻碍了在机器人领域的有效利用。为了解决这一差距，本文引入了ROS-Causal，这是一个基于ROS的框架，用于机器人上的数据收集和因果发现在人机空间交互中。集成了ROS的临时模拟器展示了该方法的有效性，展示了机器人在数据收集过程中生成因果模型。ROS-Causal可在GitHub上找到：https://github.com/lcastri/roscausal.git。",
