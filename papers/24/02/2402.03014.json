    "abstract": "This paper introduces an innovative approach to enhance distributed cooperative learning using Gaussian process (GP) regression in multi-agent systems (MASs). The key contribution of this work is the development of an elective learning algorithm, namely prior-aware elective distributed GP (Pri-GP), which empowers agents with the capability to selectively request predictions from neighboring agents based on their trustworthiness. The proposed Pri-GP effectively improves individual prediction accuracy, especially in cases where the prior knowledge of an agent is incorrect. Moreover, it eliminates the need for computationally intensive variance calculations for determining aggregation weights in distributed GP. Furthermore, we establish a prediction error bound within the Pri-GP framework, ensuring the reliability of predictions, which is regarded as a crucial property in safety-critical MAS applications.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种创新的方法，通过在多智能体系统中使用高斯过程（GP）回归来增强分布式协作学习。这项工作的主要贡献是开发了一种选举学习算法，即基于先验的选举式分布式GP（Pri-GP），它赋予了智能体基于信任度有选择地向邻居智能体请求预测的能力。所提出的Pri-GP有效提高了个体预测的准确性，特别是在智能体先验知识错误的情况下。此外，它消除了在分布式GP中确定聚合权重的计算密集型方差计算的需求。此外，我们在Pri-GP框架中建立了一个预测误差边界，确保了预测的可靠性，这被认为是在安全关键的多智能体系统应用中的一个重要性质。",
