    "translated_abstract": "测试时适应（TTA）是指在测试期间将训练好的模型调整到一个新领域。现有的TTA技术依赖于在同一领域具有多个测试图像，然而在实际应用（如医学成像）中，数据获取费用昂贵且成像条件经常变化，因此这种方法可能不切实际。本文致力于使用仅有一个未标记的测试图像来调整医学图像分割模型。大多数TTA方法直接最小化预测熵，然而在这种设置下，它们未能显著提高性能。我们还观察到，批归一化（BN）层的统计量选择是一个非常重要但不稳定的因素，因为只有一个测试域示例。为了克服这个问题，我们提出使用各种目标域统计估计的预测进行\\textit{集成}，并基于权重进行加权。",
