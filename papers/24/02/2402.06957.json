    "translated_abstract": "尽管之前的研究通过改变神经网络的参数来创建后门，但最近的研究揭示了一种更隐蔽的威胁：在网络架构定义中嵌入的后门。这涉及到注入常见的架构组件，如激活函数和池化层，以巧妙地引入一个持续存在的后门行为，即使在重新训练后也是如此。然而，架构后门的全部范围和影响仍然很少被探索。Bober-Irizar等人[2023]首次引入了架构后门；他们展示了如何为棋盘图案创建后门，但从未解释如何针对任意触发模式进行定位。在这项工作中，我们构建了一个可用于无人监督地为架构引入后门的任意触发检测器。这使我们重新审视了架构后门的概念并将其进行分类，描述了12种不同类型。为了评估检测此类后门的困难程度，...",
