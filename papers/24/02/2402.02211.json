That is, with respect to a fixed latent decision-making system (e.g., a weighted graph), we seek to solve one optimization problem (e.g., the shortest path problem) by leveraging information associated with another optimization problem (e.g., the minimal Steiner tree problem). In this paper, we study such a prototype problem called \\textit{query-decision regression with task shifts}, focusing on the shortest path problem and the minimum Steiner tree problem.

    "translated_abstract": "考虑一个具有未知权重的图，如果我们知道一些节点子集对应的最小斯坦纳树，我们能否找到一对节点的最短路径？也就是说，对于一个固定的潜在决策系统（例如加权图），我们试图通过利用与另一个优化问题（例如最小斯坦纳树问题）相关的信息来解决一个优化问题（例如最短路径问题）。在本文中，我们研究了这样一个原型问题，称为“具有任务转移的查询决策回归”，重点研究了最短路径问题和最小斯坦纳树问题。我们提供了关于构建评分模型的可实现假设空间的理论见解，并提出了两种有原则的学习框架。我们的实验研究表明，这类问题可以在具有统计显著性的程度上解决。",
