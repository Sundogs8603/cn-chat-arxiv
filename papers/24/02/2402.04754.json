    "translated_abstract": "可控布局生成是指在具有代表设计意图的约束条件下，在图形设计（例如文档和网页设计）中创建一种合理的元素可视排列的过程。尽管最近基于扩散模型的方法取得了最先进的FID分数，但与之前基于转换器的模型相比，它们往往表现出更明显的偏离对齐。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种统一的模型——LACE（Layout Constraint Diffusion Model），用于处理各种布局生成任务，例如根据指定属性排列元素、完善或完成粗糙的布局设计。该模型基于连续的扩散模型。与使用离散扩散模型的现有方法相比，连续状态空间设计可以在训练中引入可微的美学约束函数。对于条件生成，我们通过掩码输入引入条件。大量实验证明，LACE模型在不同布局生成任务上都取得了优秀的性能。",
