    "translated_abstract": "预测市场对估计在某一固定时间点上将揭晓真实性的声明的概率很有用 - 这包括关于真实世界事件价值的问题（即统计不确定性），以及关于原始递归函数价值的问题（即逻辑或算法不确定性）。然而，它们不能直接应用于没有固定解决标准的问题，并且将预测市场的真实世界应用于这类问题往往仅涉及预测一个句子是否为真，而不是它是否将被证明。这类问题可以被更基本事件的可数并或交集的方式表示，或者被表示为算术层次上的一阶逻辑句子（甚至超算术句子的 FOL 之外）。在本文中，我们提出了一种通过期权对这种事件进行押注的方法，或者等效地作为对“验证-证伪游戏”的结果押注。",
