Importantly, recent research has indicated that the reliability of polar codes can be further enhanced by substituting Arikan's kernel with a larger one, leading to a faster polarization. However, for short-to-medium block length regimes, the development of polar codes that effectively employ large kernel sizes has not yet been realized. In this paper, we explore a novel, non-linear generalization of polar codes with an expanded kernel size, which we call DeepPolar codes. Our results show that DeepPolar codes effectively utilize the benefits of larger kernel size, resulting in enhanced reliability compared to both the existing neural codes and conventional polar codes.",

    "translated_abstract": "极化码以Arikan的极化核心为基础发展而来，代表了编码理论的一个突破，并且已经成为短到中等块长度区域的最先进纠错码。最近的研究表明，通过将Arikan的核心替换为更大的核心，可以进一步提高极化码的可靠性，从而实现更快的极化。然而，对于短到中等块长度区域来说，尚未实现有效利用大核心尺寸的极化码的发展。本文探索了一种新颖的、非线性推广的极化码，它具有扩展的核心尺寸，我们称之为DeepPolar码。我们的结果表明，DeepPolar码有效地利用了更大的核心尺寸的优势，相比现有的神经码和传统的极化码，提供了更高的可靠性。",
