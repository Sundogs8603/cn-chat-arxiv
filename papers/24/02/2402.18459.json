Our analysis suggests that at least some of the pandemic-accelerated changes to the work location landscape will likely stick; with some form of hybrid work being the norm. However, the patterns will vary by department (HR/legal/sales/IT, etc.) and by sector of operations. Top three concerns among employers include: supervision and mentoring, reduction in innovation, and creativity; and the top three benefits include their ability to retain / recruit talent, positive impact on public image and their ability to compete. An Ordered Probit model of the expected April 2024 work location strategy revealed that those in transportation, warehousing, and manufacturing sectors, those with a fully in-person approach to work pre-COVID, and those with a negative outlook towards the impact of remote work are li",

    "translated_abstract": "我们通过对129家北美雇主的高管数据进行分析，提出了一个关于疫情期间远程工作的雇主视角。我们的分析表明，疫情加速了工作地点格局的部分转变，其中一些形式的混合工作可能会成为常态。然而，这种模式将会因部门（人力资源/法律/销售/IT等）和经营部门的不同而有所不同。雇主们最关注的三个问题包括：监督和辅导、创新减少和创造力；而最重要的三个优点包括他们保留/招聘人才的能力、积极影响公众形象和他们的竞争能力。",
    "tldr": "混合工作可能成为工作的常态，雇主普遍关注监督和辅导、创新减少、保留/招聘人才等问题，看法是否定的雇主更倾向于传统全程面对面工作模式。",
    "en_tdlr": "Hybrid work may become the norm, with employers focusing on supervision and mentoring, reduction in innovation, ability to retain/recruit talent, etc., while those with negative outlook lean towards traditional fully in-person work."
