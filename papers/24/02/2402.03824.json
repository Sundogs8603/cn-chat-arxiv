    "translated_title": "一种关于具象人工智能的呼吁",
    "translated_abstract": "我们提出具象人工智能作为追求人工通用智能的下一个基本步骤，并将其与当前的人工智能进展进行对比，特别是大型语言模型。我们跨越了哲学、心理学、神经科学和机器人学等多个领域对具象概念的演变进行了研究，以凸显具象人工智能如何区别于静态学习的经典范式。通过扩大具象人工智能的范围，我们引入了一个基于认知架构的理论框架，强调知觉、行动、记忆和学习作为具象代理的基本组成部分。这个框架与Friston的主动推断原则保持一致，为具象人工智能的发展提供了一个全面的方法。尽管在人工智能领域取得了进展，但仍然存在诸如制定新的人工智能学习理论和创新先进硬件等重大挑战。我们的讨论为未来具象人工智能研究奠定了基础指导。",
