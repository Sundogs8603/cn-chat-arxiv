We sought to develop a Large Language Model (LLM)-based tool capable of interrogating routinely-collected, narrative (free-text) electronic health record (EHR) data to locate published prognostic factors that capture the clinical syndrome of DTD. In this work, we use LLM-generated synthetic data (GPT3.5) and a Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm to train a BERT-based span extraction model.

    "translated_abstract": "难治性抑郁症(DTD)被提出作为一个更广泛且临床更全面的视角，该视角表明在治疗过程中，患者仍持续经历显著负担。我们致力于开发一种基于大型语言模型(LLM)的工具，能够对常规收集的叙述性（自由文本）电子健康记录(EHR)数据进行查询，以找到能捕捉DTD临床综合征的已发表预后因素。在这项工作中，我们使用LLM生成的合成数据(GPT3.5)和非极大值抑制(NMS)算法来训练一个基于BERT的片段提取模型。然后，生成的模型能够从真实的临床数据中提取和标记与DTD综合征的匹配可能性增加或减少的各种相关正负因素的片段。我们展示了在多达20个DTD临床数据集上能够获得良好的整体性能(极性为0.70 F1)。",
