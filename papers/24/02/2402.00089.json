    "abstract": "Conceptual architecture involves a highly creative exploration of novel ideas, often taken from other disciplines as architects consider radical new forms, materials, textures and colors for buildings. While today's generative AI systems can produce remarkable results, they lack the creativity demonstrated for decades by evolutionary algorithms. SCAPE, our proposed tool, combines evolutionary search with generative AI, enabling users to explore creative and good quality designs inspired by their initial input through a simple point and click interface. SCAPE injects randomness into generative AI, and enables memory, making use of the built-in language skills of GPT-4 to vary prompts via text-based mutation and crossover. We demonstrate that compared to DALL-E 3, SCAPE enables a 67% improvement in image novelty, plus improvements in quality and effectiveness of use; we show that in just 3 iterations SCAPE has a 24% image novelty increase enabling effective exploration, plus optimization",

    "translated_abstract": "概念架构涉及对来自其他学科的新颖理念进行高度创造性的探索，建筑师考虑将建筑的形式、材料、质地和颜色进行激进的创新。虽然如今的生成式人工智能系统能够产生出色的结果，但它们缺乏几十年来进化算法所展示的创造性。我们提出的工具SCAPE将进化搜索与生成式人工智能结合起来，使用户能够通过简单的点按界面探索由初始输入启发的创造性和高质量设计。SCAPE将随机性注入到生成式人工智能中，并利用GPT-4的内置语言能力通过基于文本的突变和交叉操作来变化提示。我们证明，与DALL-E 3相比，SCAPE在图像的新颖性方面提高了67%，同时在质量和使用效果方面也有所改进；我们展示，仅经过3次迭代，SCAPE的图像新颖性增加了24%，使有效的探索和优化成为可能。",
