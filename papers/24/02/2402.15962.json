    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.15962v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Manufacturing energy consumption data contains important process signatures required for operational visibility and diagnostics. These signatures may be of different temporal scales, ranging from monthly to sub-second resolutions. We introduce a hierarchical machine learning approach to identify automotive process signatures from paint shop electricity consumption data at varying temporal scales (weekly and daily). A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) combined with Logistic Regression (LR) are used for the analysis. We validate the utility of the developed algorithms with subject matter experts for (i) better operational visibility, and (ii) identifying energy saving opportunities.",
