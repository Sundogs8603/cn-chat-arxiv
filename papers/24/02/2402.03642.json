    "translated_abstract": "Stanceosaurus 语料库（Zheng等，2022）旨在提供高质量的、标注的、从Twitter中提取的五分类立场数据，适用于分析跨文化和跨语言的虚假信息。在Stanceosaurus 2.0版本中，我们扩展了这个框架，包括了俄罗斯和西班牙。前者由于与西方紧张局势和对乌克兰的暴力入侵而变得具有重要意义。而后者则代表着一个被主要社交媒体平台忽视的庞大社群。通过添加3,874条西班牙和俄语推文，涉及41则虚假信息，我们的目标是支持关注这些问题的研究。为了展示这些数据的价值，我们在多语言BERT上使用零-shot跨语言迁移，得到了与最初的Stanceosaurus研究相当的结果，两种语言的macro F1得分均为43。这显示了立场分类的可行性。",
