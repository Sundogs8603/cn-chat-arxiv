    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种名为BERT4FCA的新方法，用于在二部图网络中进行链接预测，该方法使用了形式概念分析（FCA）和BERT。二部图网络中的链接预测是一个重要的任务，可以解决社交网络中的好友推荐和作者-论文网络中的合作预测等各种实际问题。最近的研究发现，在二部图网络中，最大的双向团提供了重要的信息，可以通过FCA来提取它们。一些基于FCA的二部图链接预测方法已经取得了良好的性能。然而，我们发现这些方法的性能可以进一步提高，因为它们没有充分捕捉到提取的最大双向团的丰富信息。为了解决这个限制，我们提出了一种使用BERT的方法，它可以从FCA提取的最大双向团中学习更多信息，并利用它们进行链接预测。我们在三个真实的二部图网络上进行了实验，并展示了其效果。",
