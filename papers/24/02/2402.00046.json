    "translated_abstract": "在工业车间中，优质调度至关重要。尽管神经网络在解决这些问题方面表现出色，但其有限的可解释性阻碍了其在工业中的广泛应用。在本研究中，我们介绍了一个创新的框架来解决作业车间调度问题（JSSP）。我们的方法利用Petri网对作业车间进行建模，不仅提高了可解释性，还能直接将原始数据纳入其中，无需对JSSP实例进行预处理成非交替图。Petri网的控制能力还可以管理过程中的自动化组件，使代理人能够专注于关键决策，特别是资源分配。我们的方法中事件驱动控制和动作屏蔽的集成在公共测试基准上取得了竞争性的性能。跨一系列优化解决方案（包括启发式算法、元启发式算法和学习算法）进行的比较分析突出了其竞争性。",
