    "translated_abstract": "冲击响应分析研究经济如何对冲击（如利率变化）作出反应，并帮助政策制定者管理这些影响。尽管带有结构假设的向量自回归模型（VAR）在估计冲击响应方面传统上占主导地位，但最近局部投影因其稳健性和可解释性而受到关注。提出将许多滞后作为控制变量的方法来增强稳健性，并且包含更丰富的控制变量有助于解释其作为因果参数的含义。在这两种情况下，大量控制变量的考虑使得高维技术成为必要。尽管存在像LASSO这样的方法，但它们大多依赖于稀疏性假设-大多数参数为零，这在密集数据生成过程中有局限性。本文提出了一种在局部投影中结合高维协变量的新方法，而不依赖于稀疏性假设。",
