    "translated_abstract": "我们通过先前的生成固定滤波主动噪声控制（GFANC）框架的高效协同，实现了无延迟噪声控制。然而，协处理器中的一维卷积神经网络（1D CNN）需要使用标注的噪声数据集进行初始训练。标注噪声数据可能会消耗大量资源，并且可能引入一些偏差。本文提出了一种无监督的GFANC方法，以简化1D CNN训练过程并增强其实用性。在训练过程中，将协处理器和实时控制器集成到一个端到端可微分的ANC系统中。这使得我们可以将累积的平方误差信号作为训练1D CNN的损失函数。通过这种无监督学习范式，无监督GFANC方法不仅省略了标注过程，而且在噪声降低性能方面表现更好。",
