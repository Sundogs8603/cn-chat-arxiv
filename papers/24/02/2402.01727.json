    "translated_abstract": "与例行任务注重一致性不同，创造力和创新的目标是产生多样化的想法。本文深入探讨利用人工智能（AI）来提高创意生成过程的生产力和质量的兴趣。尽管先前的研究发现AI想法的平均质量相当高，但先前的研究也指出基于AI的头脑风暴无法创造足够的想法分散，这限制了新颖性和整体最佳想法的质量。我们的研究探讨了增加AI生成的想法分散方法。我们使用GPT-4探索不同提示方法对余弦相似度、独特想法数量和想法空间耗尽速度的影响。在以大学生为价格为50美元以下的新产品开发领域进行探索研究。在这个背景下，我们发现(1)通过不同的plausi提示方法生成的GPT-4想法池",
    "tldr": "该论文通过研究在人工智能生成的想法中如何增加多样性，探讨了在创意生成过程中利用人工智能工具提高质量和生产效率的方法。研究发现不同的提示方法可以增加思路的多样性和独特想法的数量，在新产品开发领域尤其有效。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper explores methods to increase the diversity of ideas in AI-generated brainstorming, aiming to enhance the quality and productivity of the idea generation process. The research findings suggest that different prompting methods can effectively increase the variance and the number of unique ideas, particularly in the domain of new product development."
