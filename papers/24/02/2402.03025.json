    "translated_abstract": "弱监督的实体对齐是使用有限数量的种子对齐，在不同知识图谱之间识别等价实体的任务。尽管在基于聚合的弱监督实体对齐方面取得了重大进展，但在这种设置下的基本机制仍未被探索。在本文中，我们提出了一种传播视角来分析弱监督实体对齐，并解释了现有的基于聚合的实体对齐模型。我们的理论分析揭示了这些模型实质上是寻找用于对实体相似度进行传播的操作符。我们进一步证明，尽管不同知识图谱之间存在结构异质性，基于聚合的实体对齐模型中的潜在对齐实体具有同构子图，这是实体对齐的核心前提，但尚未被研究。利用这一洞见，我们引入了潜在同构传播操作符来增强跨知识图谱的邻域信息传播。我们开发了一个通用的实体对齐框架PipEA，实现了效果显著的实验结果。",
