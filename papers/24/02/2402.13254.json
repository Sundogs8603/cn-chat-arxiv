    "translated_abstract": "我们提出CounterCurate，一个框架，全面提升对比和生成式多模态模型的视觉-语言组合推理能力。特别地，我们确定了两个尚未充分探讨的关键问题：忽视了基于物理的推理（计数和位置理解），以及利用高性能文本和图像生成模型进行语义反事实微调的潜力。我们的工作开创了一个解决这些空白的方法。我们首先突出了多模态模型（如CLIP和LLaVA）在基于物理的组合推理中几乎无法胜任的表现。然后，我们应用简单的数据增强，使用基于图像的生成模型GLIGEN生成微调数据，使得性能显著提高：在我们新的策划的Flickr30k-Positions基准测试中，CLIP和LLaVA的性能分别提高了+33%和+37%。此外，我们利用了高性能文本和图像生成模型的能力。",
