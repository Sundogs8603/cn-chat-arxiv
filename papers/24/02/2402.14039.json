This research proposes a specialty detection classifier based on a machine learning model to automate the process of detecting the correct specialty for each question and routing it to the correct doctor. The study focuses on handling multiclass and highly imbalanced datasets for Arabic medical questions, comparing some oversampling techniques, developing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for specialty detection, and exploring the hidden business areas that rely on specialty detection such as customizing and personalizing the consultation flow for different specialties.
