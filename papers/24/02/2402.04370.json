    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一个行人过马路决策模型，基于计算合理性理论。假设过马路决策是有界最优的，因为人类认知限制而产生这种有界性。之前的行人行为模型要么是“黑盒”机器学习模型，要么是具有明确对认知因素的假设的机械式模型，我们结合了这两种方法。具体而言，我们以机械方式模拟了人类视觉知觉的噪声和过马路时的奖励，但我们使用强化学习来学习有界最优行为策略。该模型可以复现比之前的模型更多已知的经验证据现象，特别是：（1）接近车辆到达的时间对行人是否接受缝隙的影响，车辆速度对（2）缝隙接受和（3）行人通过让行车辆的时间选择的影响，以及（4）这种过马路行时间选择对行人安全的影响。",
