To address this issue of academic dishonesty, our \"Exam Monitoring System: Detecting Abnormal Behavior in Online Examinations\" is designed to assist proctors in identifying unusual student behavior. Our system demonstrates high accuracy and speed in detecting cheating in real-time scenarios, providing valuable information, and aiding proctors in decision-making. This article outlines our methodology and the effectiveness of our system in mitigating the widespread problem of cheating in online exams.",
