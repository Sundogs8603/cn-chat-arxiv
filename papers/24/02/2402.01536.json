    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are now being used in a wide variety of contexts, including as creativity support tools (CSTs) intended to help their users come up with new ideas. But do LLMs actually support user creativity? We hypothesized that the use of an LLM as a CST might make the LLM's users feel more creative, and even broaden the range of ideas suggested by each individual user, but also homogenize the ideas suggested by different users. We conducted a 36-participant comparative user study and found, in accordance with the homogenization hypothesis, that different users tended to produce less semantically distinct ideas with ChatGPT than with an alternative CST. Additionally, ChatGPT users generated a greater number of more detailed ideas, but felt less responsible for the ideas they generated. We discuss potential implications of these findings for users, designers, and developers of LLM-based CSTs.",

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)现在在各种场景下被使用，包括作为创造性支持工具(CSTs)来帮助用户产生新的想法。但是LLMs真的能够支持用户的创造力吗？我们假设LLMs作为CSTs的使用可能使LLMs的用户感到更有创造力，并且扩大每位用户提出的想法的范围，但也同质化了不同用户所提出的想法。我们进行了一个36位参与者的比较性用户研究，并根据同质化假设发现，与另一种CST相比，不同用户倾向于使用ChatGPT提出较少语义上独立的想法。此外，ChatGPT用户产生了更多详细的想法，但对所生成的想法感到责任更少。我们讨论了这些发现对基于LLMs的CSTs的用户、设计师和开发者的潜在影响。",
