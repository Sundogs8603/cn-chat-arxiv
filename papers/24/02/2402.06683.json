    "translated_abstract": "虽然神经网络方法在解决经典信号处理问题方面取得了重大进展，但往往利用信号处理和神经网络两者的洞察力的混合方法能够提供更全面的解决方案。在本文中，我们提出了一种混合经典数字信号处理/深度神经网络（DSP / DNN）方法，用于源分离（SS），并强调了变分自编码器与传统SS方法之间的理论联系。我们提出了一种将单通道欠定SS任务转换为等效多通道过定SS问题的系统，在适当设计的潜在空间中处理混合物的分离任务。在潜在空间中的分离任务被视为寻找混合物的变分块分离表示。我们通过实验证明，根据经典信号处理理论结果的设计选择和变分公式，可以获得对未见过的分布具有鲁棒性的结果。",
