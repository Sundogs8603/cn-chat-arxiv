We derive a causal economic interpretation of the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process and provide the conditions for its equivalence to total effects from a recursive Directed Acyclic Graph. We extend the Gram-Schmidt process to groups of simultaneous regressors common in economic data sets and derive its finite sample properties, finding its coefficients to be unbiased, stable, and more efficient than those from Ordinary Least Squares. Finally, we apply the estimator to childhood reading comprehension scores, controlling for such highly collinear characteristics as race, education, and income. The model expands Bohren et al.'s decomposition of systemic discrimination into channel-specific effects and improves its coefficient significance levels.",
