    "translated_abstract": "随着自主智能代理的个体和协作网络的兴起，人工智能在更多关键推理和决策角色中得到应用。因此，基于伦理的审计在快速增长的人工智能安全和监管领域起着关键作用。本文通过伦理审计来调查8个主要的商业和开源大型语言模型，包括GPT-4。我们通过建立不同模型进行道德推理的能力以及比较模型作为伦理框架的规范价值观来评估可解释性和可信度。我们采用一种实验性的、基于证据的方法，通过将伦理困境提供给模型来挑战人工智能和人类的一致性。这些伦理场景旨在需要做出决策，其中情境的特定情况可能需要偏离规范伦理原则。一个复杂的伦理框架在一个模型中一致引发。然而，发现还存在令人担忧的情况。",
