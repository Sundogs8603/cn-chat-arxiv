    "translated_abstract": "在网络威胁日益复杂的时代，入侵检测系统（IDS）的效果至关重要。机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）模型为识别计算机网络中的攻击和异常提供了高效准确的解决方案。然而，在IDS中使用ML和DL模型导致了信任赤字，因为它们的决策过程不透明。这种IDS研究中的透明度差距显著，影响了信心和问责制。为了解决这个问题，本文引入了一种新颖的可解释型IDS方法，称为X-CBA，它利用图神经网络（GNN）的结构优势来有效处理网络流量数据，并采用新的可解释人工智能（XAI）方法。与大多数以GNN为基础的IDS不同，我们的方法不仅依赖于标记的网络流量和节点特征，还通过网络流量，包括边属性，来利用更广泛的流量数据。",
