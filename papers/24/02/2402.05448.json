    "abstract": "In this paper, we first present the character texture generation system \\textit{Minecraft-ify}, specified to Minecraft video game toward in-game application. Ours can generate face-focused image for texture mapping tailored to 3D virtual character having cube manifold. While existing projects or works only generate texture, proposed system can inverse the user-provided real image, or generate average/random appearance from learned distribution. Moreover, it can be manipulated with text-guidance using StyleGAN and StyleCLIP. These features provide a more extended user experience with enlarged freedom as a user-friendly AI-tool.

    "translated_abstract": "本文首先介绍了面向Minecraft视频游戏的角色纹理生成系统\"Minecraft-ify\"，该系统可以生成针对具有立方体流形的3D虚拟角色的面部聚焦图像以进行纹理映射。与现有项目或作品只生成纹理不同，提出的系统可以反转用户提供的真实图像，或从学习到的分布生成平均/随机外观。此外，它可以使用StyleGAN和StyleCLIP进行文本引导的操作。这些功能提供了更广泛的用户体验和更多的自由，是一种用户友好的AI工具。",
