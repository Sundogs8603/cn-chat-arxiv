Methods: 235 students from 5 different educational centres participate in this study between March and December 2015. Data analysis carried out is divided into two blocks: social network analysis and unsupervised machine learning techniques. As for the social network analysis, the Girvan-Newman technique was applied to find the best number of cohesive groups within each of the friendship networks of the different classes analysed.   Results: After applying Girvan-Newman in the three classes, the best division into clusters was respectively 2 for classroom A, 7 for classroom B and 6 for classroom C. There are significant differences between the groups and the gender and diet variables. After",

    "translated_abstract": "目的：通过探索群体节点属性之间的相似性，研究与饮食和性别相关的亚群存在，并通过SNA和人工智能技术分析群体之间的连接性。方法：2015年3月至12月，共有5个不同教育中心的235名学生参与了本研究。数据分析分为两个部分：社交网络分析和无监督机器学习技术。至于社交网络分析，应用Girvan-Newman技术在不同班级的友谊网络中找到最佳的内聚群体数量。结果：在三个班级中应用Girvan-Newman后，分别得到了2个、7个和6个最佳的群体划分。群体之间与性别和饮食变量之间存在显著差异。在分析了社交网络分析和无监督机器学习技术的结果后，研究者发现了影响青少年肥胖疫情的关键因素。",
    "tldr": "本研究通过应用社交网络分析和机器学习技术，研究了青少年关系行为与肥胖疫情之间的关系。研究结果表明，青少年的群体间存在显著差异，且与性别和饮食变量有关。总结出的关键因素有助于了解和干预青少年肥胖疫情。"
