    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.13379v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: When dealing with data from distinct locations, machine learning algorithms tend to demonstrate an implicit preference of some locations over the others, which constitutes biases that sabotage the spatial fairness of the algorithm. This unfairness can easily introduce biases in subsequent decision-making given broad adoptions of learning-based solutions in practice. However, locational biases in AI are largely understudied. To mitigate biases over locations, we propose a locational meta-referee (Meta-Ref) to oversee the few-shot meta-training and meta-testing of a deep neural network. Meta-Ref dynamically adjusts the learning rates for training samples of given locations to advocate a fair performance across locations, through an explicit consideration of locational biases and the characteristics of input data. We present a three-phase training framework to learn both a meta-learning-based predictor and an integrated Meta-Ref that govern",

    "translated_abstract": "处理来自不同地点的数据时，机器学习算法往往显示出对某些地点的隐式偏好，这构成了破坏算法空间公平性的偏见，这种不公平很容易在实践中广泛采用基于学习的解决方案时引入偏见进而影响后续的决策制定。然而，人工智能中关于地点偏见的研究大多被低估了。为了减轻对于地点的偏见，我们提出了一个定位元裁判（Meta-Ref）来监督深度神经网络的少样本元训练和元测试。Meta-Ref动态调整了给定地点的训练样本的学习率，通过明确考虑地点偏见和输入数据的特征来提倡跨地点的公平性表现。我们提出了一个三阶段的训练框架，来学习一个基于元学习的预测器和一个管理的整合Meta-Ref。",
