    "translated_abstract": "最近在大型语言模型（LLMs）方面的进展显著增强了自然语言处理和人工智能的能力。这些模型，包括GPT-3.5和LLaMA-2，由于具有变革性的Transformer模型，在文本生成、翻译和问答任务中取得了革命性的突破。尽管被广泛使用，LLMs也带来了一些挑战，例如在被迫做出不当回应时产生的道德困境，易受网络钓鱼攻击和侵犯隐私等问题。本文通过引入多方面的方法来解决这些挑战，包括：1）从用户输入中过滤敏感词汇，以防止产生不道德的回应；2）检测角色扮演，以阻止可能引发“越狱”情境的互动；3）实施自定义规则引擎，限制禁止内容的生成；以及4）将这些方法应用于各种LLM派生模型，如Multi-Model Large Language Models (MLLMs)。我们的方法不仅可以提高语言模型的安全性，还可以降低道德和隐私方面的风险。",
