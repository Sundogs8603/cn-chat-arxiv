    "translated_abstract": "在自然语言处理（NLP）领域的不断发展中，使用SGD和Adam等一阶（FO）优化器微调预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）已成为标准。然而，随着LLMs体积的增长，由于FO梯度计算的反向传播（BP）带来的巨大内存开销构成了一个重大挑战。解决这个问题至关重要，尤其对于内存效率至关重要的设备端训练等应用。本文提出了一种转向不使用BP的零阶（ZO）优化的方法，用于在LLM微调过程中降低内存成本，构建在MeZO提出的概念基础上。与传统的ZO梯度下降方法不同，我们的工作将探索扩展到更广泛的ZO优化技术，通过全面的、首次推出的基准研究跨越五个LLM系列（Roberta，OPT，LLaMA，Vicuna，Mistral），三种任务复杂性和五种微调方案。",
