    "translated_abstract": "最近，提出了一种在低维空间中表示实体的本体嵌入，用于本体完成。然而，用于概念子类预测的本体嵌入未解决类似和孤立实体的困难，并且未提取本体中注释公理的全局信息。本文提出了一种针对两种本体嵌入模型的自匹配训练方法：Inverted-index Matrix Embedding (InME) 和 Co-occurrence Matrix Embedding (CoME)。这两种嵌入通过每个单词在一组公理中出现的位置以及每个公理中单词的共现来捕获注释公理中的全局和局部信息。自匹配训练方法提高了概念子类预测的稳健性，当预测的超类与子类相似且孤立于本体中的其他实体时。",
