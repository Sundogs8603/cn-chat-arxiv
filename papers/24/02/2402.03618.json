    "abstract": "Humans extract useful abstractions of the world from noisy sensory data. Serial reproduction allows us to study how people construe the world through a paradigm similar to the game of telephone, where one person observes a stimulus and reproduces it for the next to form a chain of reproductions. Past serial reproduction experiments typically employ a single sensory modality, but humans often communicate abstractions of the world to each other through language. To investigate the effect language on the formation of abstractions, we implement a novel multimodal serial reproduction framework by asking people who receive a visual stimulus to reproduce it in a linguistic format, and vice versa. We ran unimodal and multimodal chains with both humans and GPT-4 and find that adding language as a modality has a larger effect on human reproductions than GPT-4's. This suggests human visual and linguistic representations are more dissociable than those of GPT-4.",

    "translated_abstract": "人类从嘈杂的感官数据中提取有用的世界抽象。连续复制允许我们通过类似于电话游戏的范式来研究人们如何构建世界，其中一个人观察一个刺激并将其复制给下一个人形成一条复制链。过去的连续复制实验通常采用单一感觉模式，但人类经常通过语言相互传达世界的抽象。为了调查语言对抽象形成的影响，我们通过要求接收视觉刺激的人以语言形式来复制它，并反之亦然，实现了一种新颖的多模态连续复制框架。我们对人类和GPT-4进行了单模态和多模态的连续复制，并发现将语言作为一种模态对人类的复制影响更大。这表明人类的视觉和语言表征比GPT-4的表征更具分离性。",
