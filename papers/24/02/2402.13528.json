However, detecting social web posts discussing concerns about anticipatory failures is under-explored. If such concerns are channeled to the appropriate authorities, it can aid in the prevention and mitigation of potential infrastructural failures. In this paper, we develop an infrastructure ombudsman -- that automatically detects specific infrastructure concerns. Our work considers several recent structural failures in the US.

    "translated_abstract": "当前研究集中于研究社交媒体上与结构失败相关的讨论，以改进灾难响应策略。然而，检测社交网络帖子中讨论关于预期失败的担忧是未被充分探索的。如果这些担忧被传达给适当的机构，可以帮助预防和减轻潜在的基础设施失败。本文中，我们开发了一种基础设施调解员——用于自动检测特定基础设施问题。我们的工作考虑了美国几起最近的结构失效事件。我们呈现了一份首创性数据集，包括从Reddit和YouTube中挖掘的2,662个社交网络实例，用于这一新颖任务。",
