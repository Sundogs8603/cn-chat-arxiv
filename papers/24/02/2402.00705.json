    "abstract": "The social sciences have produced an impressive body of research on determinants of fertility outcomes, or whether and when people have children. However, the strength of these determinants and underlying theories are rarely evaluated on their predictive ability on new data. This prevents us from systematically comparing studies, hindering the evaluation and accumulation of knowledge. In this paper, we present two datasets which can be used to study the predictability of fertility outcomes in the Netherlands. One dataset is based on the LISS panel, a longitudinal survey which includes thousands of variables on a wide range of topics, including individual preferences and values. The other is based on the Dutch register data which lacks attitudinal data but includes detailed information about the life courses of millions of Dutch residents. We provide information about the datasets and the samples, and describe the fertility outcome of interest. We also introduce the fertility prediction",

    "translated_abstract": "社会科学领域已经积累了大量有关生育结果的研究，即人们是否以及何时生育子女的决定因素。然而，这些决定因素和基本理论的预测能力很少在新数据上进行评估。这使得我们无法系统地比较研究，阻碍了知识的评估和积累。在本文中，我们介绍了两个数据集，用于研究荷兰生育结果的可预测性。一个数据集基于LISS面板，这是一个纵向调查，包括了数千个关于各种主题的变量，包括个体偏好和价值观。另一个数据集基于荷兰登记数据，缺乏态度数据，但包括了数百万荷兰居民生活轨迹的详细信息。我们提供关于数据集和样本的信息，并描述感兴趣的生育结果。我们还介绍了生育率预测的方法。",
