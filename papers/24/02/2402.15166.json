    "translated_abstract": "分裂联邦学习（SFL）是一种最近的分布式方法，用于在多个客户端之间进行协作模型训练。在SFL中，全局模型通常被分为两部分，其中客户端以并行联邦方式训练一部分，主服务器训练另一部分。尽管最近关于SFL算法发展的研究很多，但SFL的收敛分析在文献中还未有提及，本文旨在弥补这一空白。对SFL进行分析可能比对联邦学习（FL）的分析更具挑战性，这是由于客户端和主服务器之间可能存在双速更新。我们提供了针对异构数据上强凸和一般凸目标的SFL收敛分析。收敛速率分别为$O(1/T)$和$O(1/\\sqrt[3]{T})$，其中$T$表示SFL训练的总轮数。我们进一步将分析扩展到非凸目标和一些客户端可能在训练过程中不可用的情况。",
