We propose a neural network architecture that is adapted to the double machine learning (DML) framework, specifically the partially linear model. An additional contribution of our paper is a new method to generate a semi-synthetic dataset which can be used to evaluate the performance of causal effect estimation in the presence of text and images as confounders. The proposed methods and architectures are evaluated on the semi-synthetic dataset and compared to standard approaches, highlighting the potential benefit of using text and images directly in causal studies.

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了在因果推断和治疗效应估计中使用非结构化的多模态数据，即文本和图像。我们提出了一种适应于双机器学习（DML）框架，特别是部分线性模型的神经网络架构。我们论文的另一个贡献是提出了一种生成半合成数据集的新方法，该方法可用于评估在文本和图像作为混淆因素的情况下因果效应估计的性能。我们在半合成数据集上评估并与标准方法进行比较，突出了直接在因果研究中使用文本和图像的潜在好处。我们的研究结果对经济学、市场营销、金融、医学和数据科学等领域的研究人员和从业者具有重要意义，他们希望使用非传统数据估计因果数量。",
