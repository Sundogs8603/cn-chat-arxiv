We show that if $m\\geq 3$, $m\\geq p\\geq 2$, and classifications are fuzzy, that is, objects belong to a category to a certain degree, then an independent aggregator rule that satisfies a weak unanimity condition belongs to the family of Weighted Arithmetic Means. We also obtain characterization results for $m= p= 2$.",
