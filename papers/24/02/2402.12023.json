This study explores the potential of enhancing smart contract security audits using the GPT-4 model. We utilized a dataset of 35 smart contracts from the SolidiFI-benchmark vulnerability library, containing 732 vulnerabilities, and compared it with five other vulnerability detection tools to evaluate GPT-4's ability to identify seven common types of vulnerabilities.

    "translated_abstract": "智能合约作为区块链技术的关键组成部分，在确保交易自动化和遵守协议规则方面发挥着至关重要的作用。然而，智能合约容易受到安全漏洞的影响，一旦被利用，就可能导致重大资产损失。本研究探讨了使用GPT-4模型增强智能合约安全审计的潜力。我们利用了来自SolidiFI-benchmark漏洞库的35个智能合约数据集，其中包含732个漏洞，并将其与其他五种漏洞检测工具进行比较，以评估GPT-4识别七种常见漏洞的能力。此外，我们通过基于八组智能合约审计报告的CoT (Chain of Thought)提示模拟专业审计人员的审计过程，评估了GPT-4在代码解析和漏洞捕获方面的表现。我们还评估了GPT-4编写Solidity Pr的能力。",
