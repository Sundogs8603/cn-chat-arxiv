The collection of subsets of alternatives that individuals (can) evaluate is referred to as an evaluability profile. For a given evaluability profile, we define a collective evaluation function whose inputs are the evaluation orders of individuals on the subsets of alternatives that they evaluate. We investigate the properties of collective evaluation functions, which are modifications of those introduced in previous studies. We identify the necessary and sufficient conditions on the evaluability profile that ensure the existence of collective evaluation functions satisfying four different combinations of these properties.",
