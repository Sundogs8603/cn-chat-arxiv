    "translated_abstract": "在普适机器学习中，尤其是在人类行为分析（HBA）领域，RGB一直是首选的模态，因为它易于获取并且信息丰富。然而，与其优点相连的是一些挑战，包括对光照条件的敏感性和隐私问题。解决这些漏洞的一个可能性是利用不同的模态。例如，热像素能够突出人体形态，而深度模态则增加了重要的背景信息。尽管这些模态带来了相关好处，但目前只有很少一部分特定于HBA的数据集集成了这些模态。为了解决这一问题，我们的研究介绍了一种新颖的生成技术，用于创建三模态（即RGB、热像和深度）的以人为中心的数据集。这种技术利用从RGB图像中提取的人体分割掩模，并与自动获取的热像和深度背景结合。有了这两个要素，我们可以利用现有的RGB数据合成深度和热像模态。",
