    "translated_abstract": "离散扩散或流模型可以比自回归模型更快速和更可控地生成序列。我们表明，在单纯形上的原始线性流匹配不足以实现这一目标，因为它在训练目标和进一步的路径上存在不连续性。为了克服这个问题，我们基于Dirichlet分布的混合来开发在单纯形上的Dirichlet流匹配作为概率路径。在这个框架下，我们推导了混合分数和流向量场之间的连接，从而实现了分类器和无分类器指导。此外，我们提供了蒸馏Dirichlet流匹配，它可以实现一步序列生成而只有最小的性能损失，与自回归模型相比，速度提高了O(L)倍。在复杂的DNA序列生成任务中，我们证明了相对于所有基线模型在分布度量和实现生成序列的期望设计目标方面具有更优的性能。",
