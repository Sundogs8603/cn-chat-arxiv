In this work, we present the largest foundation model in brain signals, Brant-2. Compared to Brant, a foundation model designed for intracranial neural signals, Brant-2 not only exhibits robustness towards data variations and modeling scales but also can be applied to a broader range of brain neural data.

    "translated_abstract": "基础模型受益于在大量未标记数据上进行预训练，并且在少量标记数据的情况下能够在各种应用中表现出色。这种模型在分析脑信号方面特别有效，因为这一领域涵盖了众多应用场景，并且进行大规模注释是成本高昂的。在这项工作中，我们提出了脑信号领域最大的基础模型，Brant-2。与用于颅内神经信号的基础模型Brant相比，Brant-2不仅对数据变化和建模尺度表现出稳健性，而且可以应用于更广泛范围的脑神经数据。通过在大量任务上进行实验，我们展示了Brant-2对脑信号中各种应用场景的适应性。进一步分析揭示了Brant-2的可扩展性，验证了每个组件的有效性，并展示了我们模型保持的能力。",
