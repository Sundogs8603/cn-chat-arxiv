We presume that a human is best equipped to handle this task and rescue the flow of conversation. To this end, we propose a semi-autonomous system, where a remote operator can take control of an autonomous attentive listening system in real-time. In order to make human intervention easy and consistent, we introduce automatic detection of low interest and engagement to provide explicit takeover prompts to the remote operator. We implement this semi-autonomous system which detects takeover points for the operator and compare it to fully tele-operated and fully autonomous attentive listening systems. We find that the semi-autonomous system is generally perceived more positively than the autonomous system. The results suggest that i",

    "translated_abstract": "沟通中断和失去参与度的处理是口语对话系统的重要方面，尤其是对于像专注听取这样的聊天系统，用户主要在说话时。我们认为最适合处理这项任务并挽救对话流程的是人类。为此，我们提出了一个半自主系统，其中远程操作员可以实时控制自主注意力听取系统。为了使人类干预变得简单且一致，我们引入了对低兴趣和参与度的自动检测，以向远程操作员提供明确的接管提示。我们实现了这个半自主系统，该系统检测操作员的接管点，并将其与完全远程操作和完全自主的专注听取系统进行了比较。我们发现半自主系统通常比自主系统更受肯定。结果表明，",
