    "translated_abstract": "自动化机器人在未知区域的探索面临着一个重大挑战——在没有先前地图和有限外部反馈的情况下有效导航。在稀疏奖励环境中，这个挑战更加严峻，传统的探索技术往往失败。本文介绍了TopoNav，一种全新的框架，使机器人能够克服这些限制，实现高效、适应性强且目标导向的探索。TopoNav的基本构建模块是主动拓扑映射、内部奖励机制和层次化目标优先级。在探索过程中，TopoNav构建了动态拓扑地图，捕获关键位置和路径。它利用内部奖励来指导机器人朝着地图中指定的子目标前进，促进在稀疏奖励环境中的结构化探索。为了确保高效导航，TopoNav采用了分层目标驱动的主动拓扑框架，使机器人能够优先考虑最紧急的目标。",
