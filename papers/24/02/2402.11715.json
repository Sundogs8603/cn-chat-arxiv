A function analogous to the classical Gerber-Shiu expected discounted penalty function is introduced, which incorporates information on the trapping time, the capital surplus immediately before trapping and the capital deficit at trapping. Given that the remaining proportion of capital upon experiencing a capital loss is $Beta(\\alpha,1)-$distributed, closed-form expressions are obtained for quantities typically studied in classical risk theory, including the Laplace transform of the trapping time and the distribution of the capital deficit at trapping.

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇文章中，我们考虑了一个具有确定性增长和按比例损失的风险过程，以模拟一个家庭的资本。我们的工作集中在分析这样一个过程的陷阱时间，当一个家庭的资本水平陷入贫困区域时就会发生陷阱，这是一个很难在没有外部帮助的情况下摆脱的区域。我们引入了一个类似于经典的Gerber-Shiu预期折扣罚函数的函数，它包含了关于陷阱时间、陷入陷阱前立即剩余资本和陷阱时的资本赤字的信息。鉴于在经历资本损失时的剩余资本比例为$Beta(\\alpha,1)$分布，我们得到了经典风险理论中通常研究的量的闭合形式表达式，包括陷阱时间的拉普拉斯变换和陷阱时的资本赤字的分布。特别地，我们得到了一个模型。",
