    "translated_abstract": "近年来，大型语言模型（LLMs）在各个领域取得了快速发展。为了更好地服务大量的中国用户，中国的许多商业供应商采取了本地化战略，训练并提供专门为中国用户定制的本地LLMs。此外，展望未来，LLMs的一个重要应用领域将是企业和用户在工业生产领域实际部署。然而，LLMs在工业场景中的准确性和鲁棒性尚未得到很好的研究。本文在中国工业生产领域的背景下，对LLMs的准确性和鲁棒性进行了全面的实证研究。我们手动收集了来自8个不同工业部门的1200个领域特定问题来评估LLMs的准确性。此外，我们设计了一个包含四个工业特定稳定性类别和八个能力的变态测试框架，总计13,631个问题用于评估LLMs的鲁棒性。",
