    "translated_abstract": "时空知识图（STKG）通过整合时间和位置信息扩展了知识图（KG）的概念。尽管研究界关注知识图问答（KGQA），但基于STKG的涵盖时空信息的问题回答领域仍未被广泛探讨。此外，缺乏全面的数据集也阻碍了该领域的进展。为解决这一问题，我们提出了STQAD，这是一个包括10,000个自然语言问题的面向时空知识图问答（STKGQA）数据集。不幸的是，各种最先进的KGQA方法在我们的数据集上远未达到令人满意的性能。为此，我们提出了STCQA，一种新的时空KGQA方法，利用了一种名为STComplEx的新型STKG嵌入方法。通过从问题中提取时间和空间信息，我们的问答模型可以更好地理解问题。",
