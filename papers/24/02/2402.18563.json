In this work, we study whether language models (LMs) can forecast at the level of competitive human forecasters. Towards this goal, we develop a retrieval-augmented LM system designed to automatically search for relevant information, generate forecasts, and aggregate predictions. To facilitate our study, we collect a large dataset of questions from competitive forecasting platforms. Under a test set published after the knowledge cut-offs of our LMs, we evaluate the end-to-end performance of our system against the aggregates of human forecasts. On average, the system nears the crowd aggregate of competitive forecasters, and in some settings surpasses it. Our work suggests that using LMs to forecast the future could provide accurate predictions at scale and help to inform institutional decision making.",

    "translated_abstract": "预测未来事件对政策和决策制定至关重要。本研究探讨了语言模型(LMs)是否能够在竞争性人类预测者的水平上进行预测。为实现这一目标，我们开发了一种检索增强型LM系统，旨在自动搜索相关信息、生成预测和聚合预测。为了促进研究，我们收集了来自竞争性预测平台的大量问题数据集。在LM的知识截止日期之后发布的测试集下，我们评估了我们系统的端到端性能与人类预测的聚合之间的比较。平均而言，该系统接近于竞争预测者的聚合，并在某些情况下超越了它。我们的工作表明，利用LM来预测未来可能会提供准确的大规模预测，并有助于为机构决策提供信息。",
