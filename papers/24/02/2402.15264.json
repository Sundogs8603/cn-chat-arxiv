    "translated_abstract": "最近的研究初步尝试使用大型语言模型（LLMs）来解决立场检测任务，展现了有希望的结果。然而，考虑到立场检测通常需要详细的背景知识，传统的推理方法可能会忽视领域知识，以进行专业和准确的分析。因此，LLMs的推理仍有改进空间，尤其在利用LLMs的生成能力模拟特定专家（即多智能体）来检测立场方面。与现有需要详细描述并使用固定专家的多智能体作品不同，本文提出了一种Dynamic Experienced Expert Modeling（DEEM）方法，可以利用生成的经验专家，并让LLMs以半参数化方式进行推理，使专家更具普适性和可靠性。实验结果表明，DEEM在三个场景上一直达到最佳结果。",
