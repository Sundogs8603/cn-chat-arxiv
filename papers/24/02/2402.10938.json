    "translated_abstract": "在社交媒体平台时代，识别在线内容的可信度对抗击错误信息至关重要。我们提出了一种名为CREDiBERT (CREDibility assessment using Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers) 的来源可信度评估模型，针对Reddit提交进行了微调，主要关注政治话语。我们采用半监督训练方法对CREDiBERT进行训练，利用Reddit的基于社区的结构。通过使用CREDiBERT对提交内容进行编码并将其整合到Siamese神经网络中，我们显著改善了提交可信度的二元分类，相比现有方法，F1分数提高了9%。此外，我们引入了Reddit上的一种新版本的帖子-帖子网络，有效对用户互动进行编码，将二元分类任务的F1分数提高了近8%。最后，我们利用CREDiBERT评估了sus。",
