    "translated_abstract": "随着网络攻击变得越来越复杂，提高机器学习（ML）模型的鲁棒性对于各个规模的企业都必须是一个优先考虑的事项。为了可靠地比较不同ML模型在企业计算机网络中用于检测网络攻击的鲁棒性，它们必须在标准化条件下进行评估。本文提出了一种有条理的对抗鲁棒性基准，利用标准数据集生成有限制的对抗示例，评估了多个决策树集成（RF、XGB、LGBM和EBM）的鲁棒性。这些模型在原始的CICIDS2017数据集、经过校正的NewCICIDS版本以及包含了更多最新网络流量的HIKARI数据集上进行了评估。NewCICIDS导致了性能更好的模型，特别是XGB和EBM，而RF和LGBM对HIKARI的最新网络攻击的鲁棒性较差。总体而言，模型对对抗性",
