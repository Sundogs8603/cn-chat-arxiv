However, this approach can lead to two challenges: 1) user embeddings can restrict the diversity of interests captured and 2) the need to keep them up-to-date requires an expensive, real-time infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a method that overcomes these challenges in a practical, industrial setting. The method dynamically updates customer profiles and composes a feed every two minutes, employing precomputed embeddings and their respective similarities. We tested and deployed this method to personalise promotional items at Bol, one of the largest e-commerce platforms of the Netherlands and Belgium. The method enhanced customer engagement and experience, leading to a significant 4.9% uplift in conversions.",

    "translated_abstract": "在个性化推荐系统中，通常使用嵌入来编码用户动作和项目，然后在嵌入空间中进行检索，使用近似最近邻搜索。然而，这种方法可能会导致两个挑战：1）用户嵌入可能限制所捕获的兴趣多样性，2）保持它们最新需要昂贵的实时基础设施。本文提出了一种在实际工业环境中克服这些挑战的方法。该方法动态更新客户配置文件，并每两分钟组成一个信息流，利用预计算的嵌入及其各自的相似性。我们在荷兰和比利时最大的电子商务平台之一Bol上测试并部署了这种方法，该方法提高了客户参与度和体验，导致转化率显著提高了4.9％。",
