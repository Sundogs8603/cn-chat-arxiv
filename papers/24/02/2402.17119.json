    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.17119v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Automated story generation has been one of the long-standing challenges in NLP. Among all dimensions of stories, suspense is very common in human-written stories but relatively under-explored in AI-generated stories. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly promoted language generation in general, state-of-the-art LLMs are still unreliable when it comes to suspenseful story generation. We propose a novel iterative-prompting-based planning method that is grounded in two theoretical foundations of story suspense from cognitive psychology and narratology. This theory-grounded method works in a fully zero-shot manner and does not rely on any supervised story corpora. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt at suspenseful story generation with LLMs. Extensive human evaluations of the generated suspenseful stories demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

    "translated_abstract": "自动故事生成一直是自然语言处理中的一项长期挑战。在所有故事维度中，悬念在人类写的故事中非常普遍，但在人工智能生成的故事中相对不太被探索。尽管大型语言模型(LLMs)的最新进展大大推动了语言生成的发展，但在令人紧张的故事生成方面，当前最先进的LLMs在可靠性方面仍存在问题。我们提出了一种基于迭代提示的规划方法，该方法扎根于认知心理学和叙事学中关于故事悬念的两个理论基础。这种基于理论的方法完全零样本地工作，不依赖于任何监督式故事语料库。据我们所知，这篇论文是首次尝试使用LLMs生成令人紧张的故事。对生成的悬念故事进行的广泛人类评估表明了我们方法的有效性。",
