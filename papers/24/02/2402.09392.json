    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.09392v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Over the recent years, research and development in adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms for live video streaming have been successful in improving users' quality of experience (QoE) by reducing latency to near real-time levels while delivering higher bitrate videos with minimal rebuffering time. However, the QoE models used by these ABR algorithms do not take into account that a large portion of live video streaming clients use mobile devices where a higher bitrate does not necessarily translate into higher perceived quality. Ignoring perceived quality results in playing videos at higher bitrates without a significant increase in perceptual video quality and becomes a burden for battery-constrained mobile devices due to higher energy consumption. In this paper, we propose LL-GABR, a deep reinforcement learning approach that models the QoE using perceived video quality instead of bitrate and uses energy consumption along with other metrics ",

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，自适应比特率（ABR）算法在实时视频流传输方面取得了成功，通过降低延迟，提供更高比特率的视频，并将视频缓冲时间减到最小，从而提高了用户体验（QoE）。然而，这些ABR算法使用的QoE模型没有考虑到大部分实时视频流传输客户端使用的是移动设备，在移动设备上，更高的比特率不一定意味着更高的视觉感知质量。忽视感知质量会导致以更高的比特率播放视频，而并没有显著提高视觉感知质量，同时对于电池受限的移动设备来说会增加能量消耗。本文提出了一种名为LL-GABR的深度强化学习方法，该方法使用感知视频质量而不是比特率建模QoE，并将能量消耗与其他指标结合起来。",
