We employ the replica method from statistical physics in a multi-step approach to precisely trace the algorithm's evolution. Our findings indicate that the dynamics can be described effectively by a two--dimensional discrete stochastic process, where each step depends on all previous time steps, revealing a memory dependency in the procedure. The theoretical framework developed in this work is broadly applicable for the analysis of various iterative algorithms, extending beyond the scope of alternating minimization.",
