    "translated_abstract": "虽然有监督微调（SFT）已成为将大型语言模型与人类对齐的基本技术，但它被认为是肤浅的，其本质是学习样式。与此同时，最近的研究表明了对于SFT而言数据选择的重要性，显示了使用原始数据集的高质量和多样性子集进行微调会导致更好的下游性能。在这项工作中，我们重新思考了对于SFT的数据选择的直觉。考虑到SFT的肤浅性质，我们提出SFT的重要示范应该着重反映人类式的互动，而不是数据质量或多样性。然而，直接评估一个示范反映人类风格的程度并不简单。在这个方向上的初步尝试中，我们发现选择具有长回答的实例对于SFT而言比使用完整数据集或根据质量和多样性选择实例更为有效。我们假设这样一个简单的启发式方法可以捕捉到所需的示范特征。",
