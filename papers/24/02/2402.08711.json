    "translated_abstract": "本文对San-Serna和Zygalakis的《对于数值逼近遍历SDE的分布的Wasserstein距离估计》中的非渐近保证数值离散分析方法进行了修正。他们分析了UBU积分器，该积分器是二阶强型的，并且每个步骤只需要一次梯度评估，从而得到了理想的非渐近保证，特别是在Wasserstein-2距离中到达离目标分布 $\\epsilon > 0$ 的距离仅需 $\\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}\\epsilon^{-1/2})$ 步。然而，Sanz-Serna和Zygalakis (2021)中的局部误差估计存在错误，在实践中需要更强的假设才能实现这些复杂度估计。本文解决了理论与实践中观察到的许多应用场景中的维度依赖性。",
