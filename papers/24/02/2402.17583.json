    "translated_abstract": "事后分析在云系统中的事件管理中至关重要，它为改进系统的可靠性和稳健性提供了宝贵的见解。在CloudA，故障模式分析是在事后阶段执行的，涉及将事件故障分类为独特类别，称为故障模式。通过汇总和分析这些故障模式，工程师可以识别常见故障、脆弱组件和新出现的故障趋势。然而，这一过程目前是通过手动标记进行的，存在固有缺陷。一方面，事件数量庞大意味着只分析了最严重的事件，导致对故障模式的偏斜概述。另一方面，任务的复杂性需要广泛的领域知识，这导致错误和不一致性。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一种自动化方法，名为FaultProfIT，用于处理故障模式。",
