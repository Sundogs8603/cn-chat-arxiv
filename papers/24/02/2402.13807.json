    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.13807v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Policies to reduce transport emissions often overlook the international flow of used vehicles. We quantify the rate at which used vehicles generated CO2 and pollution for all used vehicles exported from Great Britain; a globally leading used vehicle exporter across 2005-2021. Destined for low-middle-income countries, exported vehicles fail roadworthiness standards and, even under extremely optimistic functioning as new assumptions, generate at least 13-53 percent more emissions than scrapped or on-road vehicles.",

    "translated_abstract": "用于减少交通排放的政策经常忽视二手车的国际流动。我们量化了自2005年至2021年从英国出口的所有二手车产生的二氧化碳和污染率；英国是全球领先的二手车出口国。出口到中低收入国家的车辆无法符合道路安全标准，即使在极其乐观的新车工作假设下，这些出口车辆产生的排放量比报废或在路上行驶的车辆多至少13-53％。",
