    "translated_abstract": "阿尔茨海默病（AD）是最常见的神经退行性疾病，但目前可用的治疗方法仅限于停止疾病进展。此外，由于疾病的异质性，这些治疗方法的有效性并不保证。因此，能够在早期阶段确定疾病亚型非常重要。当前基于数据驱动的方法可以在AD或相关疾病后期对亚型进行分类，但在预测无症状或前驱期时存在困难。此外，大多数现有模型要么缺乏分类背后的可解释性，要么只使用单一模态进行评估，限制了其分析范围。因此，我们提出了一个多模态框架，利用成像、遗传学和临床评估等早期指标将AD患者分类为早期亚型。类似地，我们建立提示信息，并使用ChatGPT等大型语言模型解释我们模型的发现。",
