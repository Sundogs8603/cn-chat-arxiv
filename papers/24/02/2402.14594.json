Novice math tutors often prioritize content-specific guidance, neglecting aspects such as social-emotional learning. Social-emotional learning promotes equity and inclusion and nurturing relationships with students, which is crucial for holistic student development. Assessing the competencies of tutors accurately and efficiently can drive the development of tailored tutor training programs. However, evaluating novice tutor ability during real-time tutoring remains challenging as it typically requires experts-in-the-loop. To address this challenge, this preliminary study aims to harness Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, to automatically assess tutors' ability of using social-emotional tutoring strategies.

    "translated_abstract": "一对一辅导是提高学习效果的有效教学方法，然而其效力取决于辅导员的能力。新手数学辅导员通常优先考虑特定内容的指导，忽视社交情感学习等方面。社交情感学习促进了公平和包容性，并培养与学生的关系，这对于学生整体发展至关重要。准确有效地评估辅导员的能力可以推动定制的辅导员培训计划的发展。然而，在实时辅导中评估新手辅导员的能力仍然具有挑战性，因为通常需要专家参与。为解决这一挑战，本初步研究旨在利用生成预训练变换器（GPT），如GPT-3.5和GPT-4模型，自动评估辅导员使用社交情感辅导策略的能力。此外，本研究还报告了财务维度的内容。",
