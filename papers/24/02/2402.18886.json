    "translated_abstract": "心血管疾病是全球死亡的主要原因，血压是一个关键指标。 动脉血压（ABP）波形提供了整个心脏周期中的连续压力测量，并提供了有价值的诊断见解。 因此，人们迫切需要无创的无袖方法来持续测量ABP波形。 准确预测ABP波形还可以改善对平均血压的估计，这是一项重要的心血管健康特征。 本研究提出了一种基于物理信息DeepONet方法的新框架来预测ABP波形。 与先前的方法不同，我们的方法要求预测的ABP波形满足带有时间周期条件和Windkessel边界条件的Navier-Stokes方程。 值得注意的是，我们的框架是第一个连续预测ABP波形的框架，同时具有地点和时间。",
