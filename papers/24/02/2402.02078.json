Inspired by prior work on English varieties, we craft and manually evaluate perturbation rules that transform German sentences into colloquial forms and use them to synthesize test sets in four ToD datasets.

    "translated_abstract": "主流的跨语言任务导向的对话（ToD）系统通过在英语中训练意图识别和槽填充的联合模型，并将其零-shot地应用到其他语言中，实现了转移学习的范式。我们填补了之前研究中的一个空白，即由于测试数据有限，往往忽视了对较低资源的口语化变体的转移。受到英语变体的先前工作的启发，我们制定并手动评估了将德语句子转换成口语形式的扰动规则，并使用它们在四个ToD数据集中合成测试集。我们的扰动规则涵盖了18个不同的语言现象，使我们能够探索每个扰动对槽位和意图性能的影响。利用这些新数据集，我们在六个不同的transformers上进行了实验评估。在这里，我们展示了当应用于口语化变体时，ToD系统在意图识别性能上保持稳定，平均准确度下降了6%（4.62个百分点）。",
