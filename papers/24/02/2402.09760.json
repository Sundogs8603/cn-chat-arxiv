    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.09760v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: This paper presents a novel Chunking-Free In-Context (CFIC) retrieval approach, specifically tailored for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Traditional RAG systems often struggle with grounding responses using precise evidence text due to the challenges of processing lengthy documents and filtering out irrelevant content. Commonly employed solutions, such as document chunking and adapting language models to handle longer contexts, have their limitations. These methods either disrupt the semantic coherence of the text or fail to effectively address the issues of noise and inaccuracy in evidence retrieval.   CFIC addresses these challenges by circumventing the conventional chunking process. It utilizes the encoded hidden states of documents for in-context retrieval, employing auto-aggressive decoding to accurately identify the specific evidence text required for user queries, eliminating the need for chunking.

    "translated_abstract": "本论文介绍了一种针对检索增强生成（RAG）系统的无块语境（CFIC）检索方法。传统的RAG系统在使用精确证据文本进行 grounding 时往往面临处理冗长文档和过滤无关内容的挑战。常用的解决方案，如文档切分和调整语言模型以处理更长的上下文，都存在局限性。这些方法要么破坏了文本的语义连贯性，要么未能有效解决证据检索中的噪声和不准确性问题。CFIC通过绕过传统的切分过程来应对这些挑战。它利用文档的编码隐藏状态进行语境检索，在对用户查询进行自回归解码时准确地识别出所需的具体证据文本，消除了切分的需求。CFIC 进一步。。。",
