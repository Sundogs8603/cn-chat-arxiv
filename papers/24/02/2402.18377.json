    "translated_abstract": "在科学中，我们致力于找到在经验现象背后的控制方程和动力规则。传统上，科学模型是通过人类洞察和实验周期推导出来的，最近深度学习技术已经被用来直接从时间序列数据中重构动力系统（DS）。最先进的动力系统重构（DSR）方法在捕捉观察到的DS的不变和长期特性方面表现出前景，但它们泛化到未观察领域的能力仍然是一个待解决的挑战。然而，这是我们期望从任何可行的科学理论中获得的至关重要的属性。在这项工作中，我们提供了一个正式框架，用于解决DSR中的泛化问题。我们解释了为什么以及如何DSR中的跨领域（OOD）泛化（OODG）与其他机器学习领域中考虑的OODG有根本区别。我们介绍基于拓扑概念和符号的数学概念，并说明",
