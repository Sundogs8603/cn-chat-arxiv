    "translated_abstract": "本文通过检验巴西长途巴士和航空公司之间的多式联运相互作用，以检查近期旨在促进两个行业竞争的自由化措施的效果。巴西国内的州际旅行服务主要由巴士提供，并且该系统完全由私营部门在公共委托下通过许可证和授权运营。2002年引入了基于机构的监管以及旨在提高根据需求和成本条件灵活调整票价的价格上限制度。通过使用基于反应函数的巴士运营商在州际旅行市场上的定价决策模型，我们在同时方程的框架中估计了巴士票价变化对航空公司票价变化的敏感性。发现巴士运营商和航空公司之间的多式联运相互作用具有高度的重要性，可能是因为他们竞争一小部分但不断增加的高端、质量好的客户。",

The study finds significant intermodal interaction between coach operators and airlines, possibly due to the competition for a small but growing group of high-end customers."
