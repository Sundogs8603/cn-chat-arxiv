    "translated_abstract": "近年来，算子学习引起了广泛关注，旨在学习函数空间之间的映射关系。之前的研究提出了利用深度神经网络(DNNs)学习这种映射的方法，实现对偏微分方程(PDEs)的解算子的学习。然而，这些方法仍然难以学习遵守物理规律的动力学。本文提出了能量一致神经算子(ENOs)，这是一个通用的框架，用于学习遵循能量守恒或耗散定律的PDE解算子。我们引入了一种受物理学能量理论启发的惩罚函数用于训练，其中能量函数由另一个DNN来建模，使得基于DNN的解算子的输出能够保证能量一致性，而不需要显式的PDEs。在多个物理系统上的实验证明ENO的性能明显优于以往方法。",
