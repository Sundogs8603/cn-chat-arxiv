The main contribution of our research on this topic is the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with log-mel spectrograms as input features for this purpose. In addition, this LSTM-based system is further enhanced by the incorporation of a simple attention mechanism that is able to determine the more relevant frames to this task. The proposed models are evaluated with the UA-Speech database that contains dysarthric speech with different degrees of severity.

    "translated_abstract": "语音可懂性可能因多种因素而降低，如嘈杂的环境、技术困难或生物条件。本研究侧重于开发一种自动无侵入性系统，用于预测后一种情况下的语音可懂性水平。我们在这个问题上的主要贡献是使用长短期记忆（LSTM）网络和对数梅尔频谱图作为输入特征来实现这个目的。此外，这个基于LSTM的系统通过引入简单的注意力机制来进一步增强，以确定更相关的帧用于这个任务。所提出的模型在UA-Speech数据库上进行评估，该数据库包含不同严重程度的口吃语音。结果显示，注意力LSTM架构优于基于手工特征的参考支持向量机（SVM）和基于平均池化的LSTM系统。",
