It is known that flexibility can further be increased if demand response is performed at the level of communities of prosumers, since aggregated groups can better coordinate electricity consumption. However, the effectiveness of such short-term optimization is highly dependent on the accuracy of electricity load forecasts both for each building as well as for the whole community.
