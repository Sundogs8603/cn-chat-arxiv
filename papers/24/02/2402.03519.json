    "translated_abstract": "标点符号恢复是自动语音识别（ASR）系统后的关键步骤，以增强转录的可读性并促进后续的自然语言处理任务。然而，传统的基于词汇的方法不足以解决西班牙语中标点符号恢复的任务，因为在未标点的陈述句和疑问句之间常常存在歧义。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的混合声学-词汇标点符号恢复系统，用于西班牙语转录，通过模块化的过程整合声学和词汇信号。我们的实验结果表明，所提出的系统可以有效提高问号的F1分数，并在公共和内部的西班牙语对话数据集上实现整体标点符号恢复。此外，与大型语言模型（LLMs）的基准比较表明，我们的方法在准确性、可靠性和延迟方面具有优势。此外，我们还展示了ASR模块的词错误率（WER）也受益于这种方法。",
