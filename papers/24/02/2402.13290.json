    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.13290v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Grounding is a challenging problem, requiring a formal definition and different levels of abstraction. This article explores grounding from both cognitive science and machine learning perspectives. It identifies the subtleties of grounding, its significance for collaborative agents, and similarities and differences in grounding approaches in both communities. The article examines the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches tailored for grounding tasks, showcasing how they can more comprehensively address grounding. Finally, we discuss areas for further exploration and development in grounding.",
