    "translated_abstract": "最近，检索增强生成（RAG）范式引起了人们的极大关注，因为它有潜力将外部知识整合到大型语言模型（LLMs）中，而无需进一步训练。尽管在自然语言应用中得到广泛探讨，但它在代码生成中的利用仍未得到充分探索。在本文中，我们介绍了一种名为知识汤中的活跃检索(ARKS)的先进策略，用于泛化大型语言模型以生成代码。与依靠单一来源不同，我们构建了一个将网页搜索、文档、执行反馈和进化代码片段整合在一起的知识汤。我们采用了一种积极的检索策略，该策略迭代地优化查询并更新知识汤。为了评估ARKS的性能，我们编制了一个新的基准，其中包括与频繁更新的库和长尾编程语言相关的现实编程问题。在ChatGPT和CodeLlama上的实验结果表明，ARKS比使用传统方法能够更好地产生代码。",
