This field has seen notable advancements through its marriage with contrastive learning, exemplified by Cluster-Contrastive Federated Clustering (CCFC). However, CCFC suffers from heterogeneous data across clients, leading to poor and unrobust performance. Our study conducts both empirical and theoretical analyses to understand the impact of heterogeneous data on CCFC. Findings indicate that increased data heterogeneity exacerbates dimensional collapse in CCFC, evidenced by increased correlations across multiple dimensions of the learned representations. To address this, we introduce a decorrelation regularizer to CCFC.

    "translated_abstract": "在联邦聚类中，多个持有数据的客户端在不交换原始数据的情况下协作对数据进行分组。这一领域通过与对比学习相结合取得了显着进展，以Cluster-Contrastive Federated Clustering (CCFC)为例。然而，CCFC受到不同客户端之间的异构数据影响，导致表现不佳且不稳健。我们的研究进行了经验和理论分析，以了解异构数据对CCFC的影响。研究结果表明，增加数据的异质性加剧了CCFC中的维度坍缩，通过增加学习表示的多个维度之间的相关性来证明。为了解决这一问题，我们向CCFC引入了一个去相关正则化器。得益于正则化器，改进的方法有效地缓解了数据异质性的不利影响，并取得了优越的性能，通过NMI分数的显著增加来证明。",
