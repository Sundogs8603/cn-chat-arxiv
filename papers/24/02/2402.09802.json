    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们考虑了\"准则崩溃\"的概念，即优化一个度量指标意味着另一个度量指标的最优性，特别关注各种学习准则下崩溃成误差概率最小化器的条件，从DRO和OCE风险（CVaR、倾斜ERM）到文献中探索的最新上升-下降算法的非单调准则（洪水、SoftAD）。我们展示了在伯努利分布损失的背景下，CVaR和DRO的现有结果远远超越了崩溃的范围，然后扩大了我们的范围，包括代理损失，展示了像倾斜ERM这样的单调准则无法避免崩溃的条件，而非单调的替代方案可以。",
    "tldr": "该论文研究了\"准则崩溃\"的概念，即优化一个度量指标意味着另一个度量指标的最优性。研究结果发现，对于损失的伯努利分布，CVaR和DRO的结果远超出现有研究，同时发现了一些特定条件下，单调准则如倾斜ERM无法避免崩溃，而非单调的替代方案可以。",
    "en_tdlr": "This paper investigates the concept of \"criterion collapse,\" where optimizing one metric implies optimality in another. The research findings show that for losses with a Bernoulli distribution, CVaR and DRO yield results that go beyond existing research, and also identify conditions where monotonic criteria like tilted ERM fail to avoid collapse, while non-monotonic alternatives can."
