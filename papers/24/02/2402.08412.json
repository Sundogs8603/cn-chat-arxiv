    "translated_abstract": "在各种学科中，对网络上的多智体系统进行建模是一个基本的挑战。我们从由多条轨迹组成的数据中联合推断网络的权重矩阵和相互作用核，分别确定哪些智体与哪些其他智体相互作用以及这种相互作用的规则。我们提出的估计器自然地导致一个非凸优化问题，并研究了两种解决方案：一种基于交替最小二乘（ALS）算法，另一种基于一种名为交替最小二乘的算子回归（ORALS）的新算法。这两种算法都可扩展到大量数据轨迹。我们建立了保证可识别性和良定义性的强制性条件。尽管ALS算法在小数据情况下缺乏性能和收敛性保证，但表现出统计效率和鲁棒性。在强制性条件下，ORALS估计器是一致的，并且在渐近情况下具有正态性。",
