Previous research has tackled this problem with gradually weaker training supervision, from heavy intermediate visual observations or language instructions to task class supervision. However, with the advent of large language models, even given only the task name, these models can produce a detailed plan. In this study, we propose a much weaker setting without task name as supervision, which is not currently solvable by existing large language models since they require good prompts with sufficient information.

    "translated_abstract": "该论文探讨了指导视频中程序规划的挑战，其中涉及根据视频中的视觉起始点和目标观察创建目标导向计划。先前的研究通过逐渐减弱训练监督来解决这一问题，从重型中间视觉观察或语言说明到任务类别监督。然而，随着大型语言模型的出现，即使只给出任务名称，这些模型也能生成详细的计划。在这项研究中，我们提出了一种没有任务名称作为监督的更弱设置，这是当前大型语言模型无法解决的，因为它们需要具有足够信息的良好提示。具体来说，我们假设先前的中间监督可以作为上下文信息，并且我们使用视觉起始点和目标观察的标题作为一个更廉价的监督形式。这种方法大大降低了标注成本",
