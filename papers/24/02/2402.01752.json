    "translated_abstract": "YouTube面临着全球范围内虚假信息和仇恨言论的传播危机。为解决这些问题，YouTube已实施严格规定，禁止上传包含虚假信息或宣传仇恨言论的内容。虽然已经进行了许多降低冒犯性英语内容的研究，但对僧伽罗语内容的研究仍然相对较少。本研究旨在通过提出解决方案，减少僧伽罗语YouTube视频中暴力和虚假信息的传播。该方法包括开发一个评级系统，通过比较标题和描述与音频内容，评估视频是否包含虚假信息，并检测其中是否存在仇恨言论。方法包括使用Pytube库进行音频提取，使用经过微调的Whisper模型进行音频转录，使用distilroberta-base模型进行仇恨言论检测和文本分类。",
