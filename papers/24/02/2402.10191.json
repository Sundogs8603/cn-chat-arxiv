The deployment of FL in numerous real-world applications faces delays, primarily due to the prevalent reliance on supervised tasks. Generating detailed labels at edge devices, if feasible, is demanding, given resource constraints and the imperative for continuous data updates. In addressing these challenges, solutions such as federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL), which relies on unlabeled clients' data and a limited amount of labeled data on the server, become pivotal. In this paper, we propose FedAnchor, an innovative FSSL method that introduces a unique double-head structure, called anchor head, paired with the classification head trained exclusively on labeled anchor data on the server. The anchor head is empowered with a newly designed label contrastive loss base",
