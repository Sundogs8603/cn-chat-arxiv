    "abstract": "Improving factual consistency in abstractive summarization has been a focus of current research. One promising approach is the post-editing method. However, previous works have yet to make sufficient use of factual factors in summaries and suffers from the negative effect of the training datasets. In this paper, we first propose a novel factual error correction model FactCloze based on a conditional-generation cloze task. FactCloze can construct the causality among factual factors while being able to determine whether the blank can be answered or not. Then, we propose a data distillation method to generate a more faithful summarization dataset SummDSC via multiple-dimensional evaluation. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach, which leads to an improvement in multiple factual consistency metrics compared to baselines.",

    "translated_abstract": "提高抽象摘要中的真实一致性一直是当前研究的重点。一种有前途的方法是后期编辑方法。然而，先前的工作尚未充分利用摘要中的真实因素，并且受到训练数据集的负面影响。在本文中，我们首先提出了一种基于条件生成填空题的新型真实错误修正模型FactCloze。FactCloze可以在摘要中构建真实因素之间的因果关系，同时能够确定空白是否可以回答。然后，我们提出了一种通过多维评估生成更加准确的摘要数据集SummDSC的数据精炼方法。通过实验证实了我们的方法的有效性，与基准方法相比，在多个真实一致性指标上实现了改进。",
