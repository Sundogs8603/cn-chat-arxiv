    "translated_abstract": "最近，基于配置文件的口语理解（SLU）引起了越来越多的关注，旨在将各种类型的补充配置文件信息（即，知识图谱、用户配置文件、上下文感知）纳入其中，以消除用户话语中常见的歧义。然而，现有方法仅能分别对不同的配置文件信息进行建模，而不考虑它们之间的相互关系，或者排除其中的不相关和冲突信息。为了解决上述问题，我们引入了一种用于在多个配置文件信息之间进行推理的异构图注意力网络，称为Pro-HAN。具体而言，我们设计了三种类型的边，分别表示配置文件内部、配置文件之间和话语与配置文件之间的关系，以捕捉多个配置文件之间的相互关系。在ProSLU数据集上，我们建立了一个新的最先进状态，并在所有三个度量标准上取得了约8%的提升。进一步的分析实验证实了我们的方法在建模粒度、召回率和F1分数方面的有效性。",
