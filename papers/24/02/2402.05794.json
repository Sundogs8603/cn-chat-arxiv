    "abstract": "Speech technologies rely on capturing a speaker's voice variability while obtaining comprehensive language information. Textual prompts and sentence selection methods have been proposed in the literature to comprise such adequate phonetic data, referred to as a phonetically rich \\textit{corpus}. However, they are still insufficient for acoustic modeling, especially critical for languages with limited resources. Hence, this paper proposes a novel approach and outlines the methodological aspects required to create a \\textit{corpus} with broad phonetic coverage for a low-resourced language, Brazilian Portuguese. Our methodology includes text dataset collection up to a sentence selection algorithm based on triphone distribution. Furthermore, we propose a new phonemic classification according to acoustic-articulatory speech features since the absolute number of distinct triphones, or low-probability triphones, does not guarantee an adequate representation of every possible combination.

    "translated_abstract": "语音技术依赖于捕捉说话人的声音变异性和获取全面的语言信息。文本提示和句子选择方法已经在文献中被提出，以组成适度的音标数据，被称为音标丰富的语料库。然而，对于资源有限的语言而言，它们仍然对声学建模不足。因此，本文提出了一种新的方法，并概述了为资源有限的巴西葡萄牙语创建具有广泛音标覆盖的语料库所需的方法论方面。我们的方法包括从文本数据集收集到基于三音分布的句子选择算法。此外，我们提出了一种新的音素分类方法，根据声学-发音语音特征，因为不同的三音的绝对数量或低概率三音并不能保证对每种可能的组合进行适当的表示。",
