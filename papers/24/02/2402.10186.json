Despite its potential, there is less guarantee for the model to generalize to unseen data that hinders its application in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, a technique has been proposed to estimate the accuracy of the predictions. This method integrates machine learning with self-consistent field methods to achieve both low validation cost and interpret-ability. This, in turn, enables exploration of the model's ability with active learning and instills confidence in its integration into real-world studies.",

    "translated_abstract": "机器学习已经成为有效解决电子结构问题的重要方法。尽管其潜力巨大，但模型在未见数据上的泛化能力缺乏保证，这限制了其在实际场景中的应用。为了解决这个问题，提出了一种技术来估计预测的准确性。该方法将机器学习与自洽场方法结合起来，既能实现低验证成本，又能解释性强。这反过来使得能够通过主动学习来探索模型的能力，并为将其集成到实际研究中赋予信心。",
