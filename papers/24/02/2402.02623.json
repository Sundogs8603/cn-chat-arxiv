    "abstract": "Using Betfair's time series data, an analysis of the United Kingdom (UK) horse racing market reveals an interesting paradox: a market with short tails, rapidly decaying autocorrelations, and no long-term memory. There seems to be a remarkably high level of informational efficiency in betting exchange returns, in contrast to financial assets that are characterized by heavy tails and volatility clustering. The generalized Gaussian unconditional distribution with a light tail point to a market where knowledge is quickly assimilated and reflected in prices. This is further supported by the extremely quick fading of autocorrelations and the absence of gain-loss asymmetry. Therefore, in addition to measuring long-range memory, the Hurst exponent also shows mean reversion, a sign that markets respond quickly to fresh information.",

    "translated_abstract": "使用Betfair的时间序列数据，对英国（UK）赛马市场进行了分析，发现了一个有趣的悖论：投注交易回报的市场具有短尾、快速衰减的自相关性和无长期记忆。与具有重尾和波动性聚类特征的金融资产相比，投注交易回报的信息效率非常高。具有轻尾的广义高斯无条件分布表明市场知识很快被吸收并反映在价格上。这进一步得到了自相关性极快减弱和收益-损失不对称缺失的支持。因此，除了测量长期记忆之外，Hurst指数也显示出均值回归，表明市场对新信息的快速响应。",

Unlike financial assets, market knowledge is quickly assimilated and reflected in prices, and markets respond quickly to fresh information."
