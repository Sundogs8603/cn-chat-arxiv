    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.10101v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: As the effective range of air-to-air missiles increases, it becomes harder for human operators to maintain the situational awareness needed to keep a UAV safe. In this work, we propose a decision support tool to help UAV operators in Beyond Visual Range (BVR) air combat scenarios assess the risks of different options and make decisions based on those. Earlier work focused on the threat posed by a single missile, and in this work, we extend the ideas to several missile threats. The proposed method uses Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to learn from high-fidelity simulations to provide the operator with an outcome estimate for a set of different strategies. Our results demonstrate that the proposed system can manage multiple incoming missiles, evaluate a family of options, and recommend the least risky course of action.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着空对空导弹的有效射程增加，人类操作员难以保持无人机所需的情况感知能力。在本研究中，我们提出了一种决策支持工具，以帮助无人机操作员在视线外（BVR）空战情景中评估不同选择的风险，并根据这些选择做出决策。早期的工作侧重于单一导弹的威胁，而在本研究中，我们将这些想法拓展到多个导弹威胁上。所提出的方法使用深度神经网络（DNN）通过高保真度模拟学习，为操作员提供一组不同策略的结果估计。我们的结果表明，所提出的系统可以处理多个来袭导弹，评估一系列选项，并推荐风险最小的行动方针。",
