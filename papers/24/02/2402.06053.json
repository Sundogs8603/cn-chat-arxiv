By semantically traversing the bi-directional problem and solution tree at different temperature levels we achieve high diversity in solution edit distance while still remaining close to the original problem statement semantically. In addition to finding a variety of solutions to a given problem, this method can also be used to refine and clarify the original problem statement. As further validation of the approach, we implemented a proof-of-concept Slack bot to serve as an innovation assistant.",
