Remediating norm violations requires social awareness and cultural sensitivity of the nuances at play. To equip interactive AI systems with a remediation ability, we offer ReNoVi - a large-scale corpus of 9,258 multi-turn dialogues annotated with social norms, as well as define a sequence of tasks to help understand and remediate norm violations step by step. ReNoVi consists of two parts: 512 human-authored dialogues (real data), and 8,746 synthetic conversations generated by ChatGPT through prompt learning. While collecting sufficient human-authored data is costly, synthetic conversations provide suitable amounts of data to help mitigate the scarcity of training data, as well as the chance to assess the alignment between LLMs and humans in the awareness of social norms.

    "translated_abstract": "规范违反发生在个体未能遵守文化接受行为时，可能会导致潜在冲突。纠正规范违反需要对正在发生的微妙社会认知和文化敏感。为了赋予互动人工智能系统纠正能力，我们提供了ReNoVi - 一个包含9,258个多轮对话注释有社会规范的大规模语料库，并定义了一系列任务以帮助逐步理解和纠正规范违反。ReNoVi包含两个部分：512个人类编写的对话（真实数据）和通过提示学习由ChatGPT生成的8,746个合成对话。尽管收集充足的人类编写数据成本高昂，但合成对话提供了适量的数据帮助缓解训练数据的稀缺，并且评估了LLM与人类在社会规范认知方面的一致性的机会。因此，我们利用ChatGPT的优势来进行...",
