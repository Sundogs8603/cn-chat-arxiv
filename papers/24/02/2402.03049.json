    "translated_abstract": "近年来，指令调整已经引起了越来越多的关注，并成为增强大型语言模型（LLMs）能力的一种关键技术。为了构建高质量的指令数据集，已经提出了许多指令处理方法，旨在在数据数量和数据质量之间达到精巧的平衡。然而，由于各种指令处理方法之间仍然存在不一致，目前没有标准的开源指令处理实现框架可供社区使用，这使得从业者无法进一步开发和推进。为了促进指令处理的研究和开发，我们提出了EasyInstruct，一个易于使用的用于LLMs的指令处理框架，它将指令生成、选择和提示模块化，并考虑它们的组合和交互。EasyInstruct已经在https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyInstruct上公开发布，并得到了积极维护。",
