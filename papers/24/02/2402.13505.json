    "translated_abstract": "近年来半监督学习的最新进展集中在解决一个更为逼真但具有挑战性的任务：解决标记数据的不平衡问题，同时未标记数据的类别分布既未知又可能不匹配。当前这一领域的方法往往预设了关于未标记数据类别分布的严格假设，从而限制了模型仅适应于某些分布范围。在本研究中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，引入了一个高度适应性的框架，命名为SimPro，它不依赖于任何关于未标记数据分布的预定义假设。我们的框架建立在一个概率模型上，通过明确分离条件和边缘类别分布的建模，创新地改进了期望最大化（EM）算法。这种分离促进了在最大化过程中对类别分布进行估计的闭合形式解决方案。",
