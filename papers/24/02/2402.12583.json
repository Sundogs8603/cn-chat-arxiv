To address this issue, the econometrics literature has turned to the triple difference estimator. Both DiD and triple difference are limited to assessing average effects exclusively. An alternative avenue is offered by the changes-in-changes (CiC) estimator, which provides an estimate of the entire counterfactual distribution at the cost of relying on (stronger) distributional assumptions. In this work, we extend the triple difference estimator to accommodate the CiC framework, presenting the `triple changes estimator' and its identification assumptions, thereby expanding the scope of the CiC paradigm. Subsequently, we empirically evaluate the proposed framework and apply it to a study examining the impact of Medicaid expansion on children's preventive care.",

    "translated_abstract": "著名的差异与差异（DiD）估计器依赖于“平行趋势”的假设，在许多实际应用中并不成立。为解决这一问题，计量经济学文献已经转向三重差异估计器。DiD和三重差异均仅限于评估平均效应。另一种替代方法是改变中的改变（CiC）估计器，它提供了对整个反事实分布的估计，但需要依赖于（更强）分布假设。在这项工作中，我们扩展了三重差异估计器以适应CiC框架，提出了“三重变化估计器”及其识别假设，从而扩展了CiC范式的范围。随后，我们对所提出的框架进行实证评估，并将其应用于一项研究，探讨医疗补助扩大对儿童预防保健的影响。",
