Numerous recommendation algorithms are designed to provide users with a personalized array of information tailored to their preferences.

Consequently, achieving the right balance between accuracy and diversity in recommendations is a pressing concern. To address this challenge, exemplified by music recommendation, we introduce the Diversified Weighted Hypergraph music Recommendation algorithm (DWHRec).

    "translated_abstract": "推荐系统对用户有着双重作用：过滤不合适或不匹配的信息，同时准确识别符合其偏好的项目。许多推荐算法旨在为用户提供个性化的信息阵列，以满足其偏好。然而，过度个性化可能会将用户限制在“筛选气泡”中。因此，在推荐中获得准确性和多样性之间的平衡是一项迫切关注的问题。为了应对这一挑战，以音乐推荐为例，我们介绍了多样化加权超图音乐推荐算法（DWHRec）。在DWHRec算法中，用户和已听曲目之间的初始连接由加权超图表示。同时，还将艺术家、专辑和标记与曲目的关联也附加到超图中。为了探索用户的潜在偏好，一个超图",
