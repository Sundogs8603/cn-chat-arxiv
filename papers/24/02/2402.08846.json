We found that delicate designs are not necessary, while an embarrassingly simple composition of off-the-shelf speech encoder, LLM, and the only trainable linear projector is competent for the ASR task.

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们将重点放在解决语音处理领域中最重要的任务之一，即使用语音基本编码器和大型语言模型（LLM）进行自动语音识别（ASR）。最近的研究采用了复杂的设计，例如对语音编码器进行时间压缩，处理投影仪的模态对齐，并利用参数高效的微调方法对LLM进行调整。我们发现，并不需要精细的设计，而是一个由现成的语音编码器、LLM和唯一可训练的线性投影器组成的简单组合就能胜任ASR任务。具体而言，我们对各种LLM和语音编码器的组合进行基准测试和探索，从而得到了最佳的基于LLM的ASR系统，我们将其称为SLAM-ASR。所提出的SLAM-ASR提供了一个清晰的设置和少量的任务特定设计，只有线性投影器需要进行训练。据我们所知，SLAM-ASR取得了最佳的性能。",
