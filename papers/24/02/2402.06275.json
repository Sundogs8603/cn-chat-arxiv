    "translated_abstract": "平滑粒子流体动力学（SPH）在现代工程和科学领域中无处不在。SPH是一类通过有限材料点对流体动力学进行离散化处理的拉格朗日方案，通过跟踪这些材料点来追踪其演变的速度场。由于仿真的粒子特性，图神经网络（GNN）已经成为一种具有吸引力和成功的替代方法。然而，这种基于GNN的模拟器的实际实用性依赖于其对物理模型的准确建模能力，在长时间范围内提供准确且稳定的预测，这是一个众所周知的难题。在这项工作中，我们确定了张力不稳定性导致的粒子聚类现象是主要问题之一。基于这些见解，我们用标准SPH求解器的各个组成部分（包括压力、粘性和外力部分）增强了最先进的基于GNN的模拟器的训练和推断。所有经过神经SPH增强的模拟器都取得了更好的性能。",
