A major limitation of existing procedures is not accounting for censoring, despite the abundance of RCTs and OSes that report right-censored time-to-event outcomes. We consider two cases where censoring time (1) is independent of time-to-event and (2) depends on time-to-event the same way in OS and RCT. For the former, we adopt a censoring-doubly-robust signal for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) to facilitate an equivalence test of CATEs in OS and RCT, which serves as a proxy for testing if the validity assumptions hold. For the latter, we show that the same test can still be used even though unbiased CATE estimation may not be possible. We verify the effectiveness of our censoring-aware tes",

    "translated_abstract": "从观测研究中推断因果关系需要进行无法验证的有效性假设；然而，可以通过将观测研究与随机对照试验（RCT）中的实验数据进行基准测试来验证这些假设。现有程序的一个主要限制是未考虑到截尾现象，尽管有大量的RCT和报告右截尾时间间隔事件结果的观测研究。我们考虑两种情况，其中截尾时间（1）独立于时间间隔事件，以及（2）在观测研究和RCT中以相同方式取决于时间至事件。对于前者，我们采用一种截断-双重鲁棒信号，用于条件平均处理效应（CATE）的等价性测试，以促进OS和RCT中CATE的等价性测试，这相当于测试有效性的假设是否成立。对于后者，我们发现尽管可能无法进行无偏CATE估计，但仍然可以使用相同的测试。我们验证了我们的考虑截尾的测试的有效性",
