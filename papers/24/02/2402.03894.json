    "abstract": "We study the interpersonal trust of a population of agents, asking whether chance may decide if a population ends up in a high trust or low trust state. We model this by a discrete time, random matching stochastic coordination game. Agents are endowed with an exponential smoothing learning rule about the behaviour of their neighbours. We find that, with probability one in the long run the whole population either always cooperates or always defects. By simulation we study the impact of the distributions of the payoffs in the game and of the exponential smoothing learning (memory of the agents). We find, that as the agent memory increases or as the size of the population increases, the actual dynamics start to resemble the expectation of the process. We conclude that it is indeed possible that different populations may converge upon high or low trust between its citizens simply by chance, though the game parameters (context of the society) may be quite telling.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一群智能体的人际信任，探讨了机会是否会决定一个群体最终是处于高信任还是低信任状态。我们用离散时间、随机匹配的协调博弈模型来建模。智能体对邻居的行为采用指数平滑学习规则。我们发现，随着时间推移，整个群体要么始终合作，要么始终背叛，这种情况以概率1发生。通过模拟，我们研究了游戏中收益分布和指数平滑学习（智能体的记忆）的影响。我们发现，随着智能体记忆的增加或群体规模的增加，实际动态开始与过程的期望相似。我们得出结论，不同的群体可能仅仅是由于机会的原因而收敛到高或低信任的状态，尽管游戏参数（社会背景）可能起着重要作用。",

    "en_tdlr": "This study investigates the interpersonal trust of a population of agents and finds that over time, the population either consistently cooperates or consistently defects. The simulation experiments reveal that the agent's memory and the size of the population have an impact on the dynamics. The research suggests that different populations may converge upon high or low trust states due to chance, but the societal context is also influential."
