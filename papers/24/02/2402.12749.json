This study introduces Me LLaMA, a medical LLM family including foundation models - Me LLaMA 13/70B and their chat-enhanced versions - Me LLaMA 13/70B-chat, developed through the continual pre-training and instruction tuning of LLaMA2 using large medical data.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，诸如ChatGPT和LLaMA等大型语言模型(LLMs)在许多人工智能应用中展现出巨大的潜力。然而，它们在医学任务上的表现不够理想，并且可以通过在大型领域特定数据集上进行训练来进一步改进。本研究引入了Me LLaMA，一个医学LLM系列，包括基础模型- Me LLaMA 13/70B及其 chat-enhanced 版本- Me LLaMA 13/70B-chat，通过持续对LLaMA2进行预训练和指导调整，使用大规模医学数据开发而成。我们用于训练和评估的领域特定数据套件包括一个具有129B tokens的大规模持续预训练数据集，一个包含214k个样本的指导调整数据集，以及跨越14个数据集的六项任务的医学评估基准(MIBE)。我们使用MIBE进行的广泛评估显示，Me LLaMA模型在零-shot和少-shot学习方面超越了现有的开源医学LLMs，并且在商业巨头如ChatGPT上表现出色。",
