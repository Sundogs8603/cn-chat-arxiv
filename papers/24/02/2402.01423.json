    "abstract": "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key information extraction task with a long-standing tradition. While recent studies address and aim to correct annotation errors via re-labeling efforts, little is known about the sources of human label variation, such as text ambiguity, annotation error, or guideline divergence.

This paper studies disagreements in expert-annotated named entity datasets for three languages: English, Danish, and Bavarian. We show that text ambiguity and artificial guideline changes are dominant factors for diverse annotations among high-quality revisions. We survey student annotations on a subset of difficult entities and substantiate the feasibility and necessity of manifold annotations for understanding named entity ambiguities from a distributional perspective.",

    "translated_abstract": "命名实体识别（NER）是一项重要的信息提取任务，有着悠久的传统。尽管最近的研究通过重新标注的努力来解决注释错误，但人类标签变异的来源，如文本歧义、注释错误或指南分歧，知之甚少。这在高质量的数据集和英语CoNLL03之外尤为突出。本文研究了三种语言（英语、丹麦语和巴伐利亚语）的专家标注的命名实体数据集中的不一致性。我们显示，文本歧义和人为指南更改是高质量修订中不同标注的主要因素。我们调查了学生对一部分困难实体的标注，并从分布角度验证了多样化标注用于理解命名实体歧义的可行性和必要性。",

The feasibility and necessity of manifold annotations for understanding named entity ambiguities are validated."
