    "translated_abstract": "现代推荐系统可能会因为训练数据的微小扰动而输出大不相同的推荐结果。单个用户数据的改变会改变其他用户的推荐结果。在医疗、住房和金融等应用中，这种敏感性可能对用户体验产生不利影响。我们提出了一种方法来稳定给定的推荐系统，抵抗这种扰动。这是一个具有挑战性的任务，因为(1)缺乏可以用来锚定输出的“参考”排序列表；(2)在保证模型与训练数据的所有可能扰动的排序列表稳定性方面存在计算挑战。我们的方法FINEST通过从给定的推荐模型获得参考排序列表，然后在模拟的扰动场景下进行模型微调，并保持排序的规则化来克服这些挑战。我们在真实世界的数据集上的实验证明FINEST可以稳定推荐系统并保持性能。",
