    "translated_abstract": "为了实现有效的大规模、现实世界的机器人应用，我们必须评估我们的机器人策略在环境条件变化时的适应能力。不幸的是，大多数研究评估机器人在与训练设置非常相似甚至相同的环境中的性能。我们提出了一个新颖的模拟基准测试THE COLOSSEUM，其中包括20个不同的操作任务，可以对模型在12个环境干扰轴上进行系统评估。这些干扰包括物体、桌面和背景的颜色、纹理和大小的变化；我们还改变了光照、干扰因素和相机姿态。使用THE COLOSSEUM，我们比较了4个最先进的操作模型，发现它们的成功率在这些干扰因素下下降了30-50%。当多个干扰同时应用时，成功率下降至≥75%。我们确定了改变干扰对象数量、目标对象颜色或光照条件会对模型的性能产生重要影响。",
