    "abstract": "Humans possess a remarkable capacity to recognize and manipulate abstract structure, which is especially apparent in the domain of geometry. Recent research in cognitive science suggests neural networks do not share this capacity, concluding that human geometric abilities come from discrete symbolic structure in human mental representations. However, progress in artificial intelligence (AI) suggests that neural networks begin to demonstrate more human-like reasoning after scaling up standard architectures in both model size and amount of training data. In this study, we revisit empirical results in cognitive science on geometric visual processing and identify three key biases in geometric visual processing: a sensitivity towards complexity, regularity, and the perception of parts and relations. We test tasks from the literature that probe these biases in humans and find that large pre-trained neural network models used in AI demonstrate more human-like abstract geometric processing.",

    "translated_abstract": "人类在识别和操作抽象结构方面拥有非凡能力，尤其在几何领域表现尤为明显。最近的认知科学研究表明神经网络并不具备这种能力，得出结论认为人类的几何能力来自于心理表征中的离散符号结构。然而，人工智能（AI）的进展表明，当标准架构在模型大小和训练数据量上扩大后，神经网络开始展现出更具人类化的推理能力。在这项研究中，我们重新审视了认知科学中关于几何视觉处理的实证结果，并确定了几何视觉处理中的三个关键偏见：对复杂性、规则性和部件与关系的感知敏感性。我们测试了文献中探测这些偏见的人类任务，并发现AI中使用的大型预训练神经网络模型表现出更类似人类的抽象几何处理能力。",
