CriticBench encompasses five reasoning domains: mathematical, commonsense, symbolic, coding, and algorithmic. It compiles 15 datasets and incorporates responses from three LLM families. Utilizing CriticBench, we evaluate and dissect the performance of 17 LLMs in generation, critique, and correction reasoning, i.e., GQC reasoning.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）批判和完善其推理的能力对于它们在评估、反馈提供和自我改进中的应用至关重要。本文引入了CriticBench，一个旨在评估LLMs在各种任务中批判和纠正其推理能力的综合基准测试。CriticBench包含五个推理领域：数学、常识、符号、编码和算法。它整合了15个数据集，并结合了三个LLM系列的响应。利用CriticBench，我们评估和剖析了17个LLMs在生成、批判和修正推理（即GQC推理）中的表现。我们的研究结果显示：（1）GQC能力呈线性关系，批判性训练显著提升了性能；（2）修正效果在任务上有所不同，以逻辑为导向的任务更容易修正；（3）GQC知识的不一致性。",
