    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.10628v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In pursuit of fairness and balanced development, recommender systems (RS) often prioritize group fairness, ensuring that specific groups maintain a minimum level of exposure over a given period. For example, RS platforms aim to ensure adequate exposure for new providers or specific categories of items according to their needs. Modern industry RS usually adopts a two-stage pipeline: stage-1 (retrieval stage) retrieves hundreds of candidates from millions of items distributed across various servers, and stage-2 (ranking stage) focuses on presenting a small-size but accurate selection from items chosen in stage-1. Existing efforts for ensuring amortized group exposures focus on stage-2, however, stage-1 is also critical for the task. Without a high-quality set of candidates, the stage-2 ranker cannot ensure the required exposure of groups. Previous fairness-aware works designed for stage-2 typically require accessing and traversing all item",
