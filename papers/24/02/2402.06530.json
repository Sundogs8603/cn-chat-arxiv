    "translated_abstract": "早期心肌梗死（MI）的检测对于预防进一步心肌损伤非常重要，MI是由冠状动脉疾病（CAD）引起的一种严重疾病。本研究引入了一种新方法，使用一种基于超声心动图的单一类别分类（OCC）算法进行早期MI检测。我们的研究通过采用基于多模态子空间支持向量数据描述的新方法克服了超声心动图数据有限的挑战。提出的技术涉及一种特殊的MI检测框架，使用复合核在非线性投影技巧中融合高斯和拉普拉斯sigmoid函数，将多视图超声心动图结合起来。此外，我们通过在优化过程中调整投影矩阵的最大化策略，提高了投影矩阵更新策略的效果。我们的方法通过将从超声心动图数据中提取的特征有效地转化为优化的低维空间，增强了MI检测的能力。",
