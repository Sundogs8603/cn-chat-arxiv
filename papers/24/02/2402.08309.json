To address this, we propose a detection approach based on a novel document vectorization method that utilizes an ensemble of LLMs to create representation vectors. By prompting LLMs to reason and respond to human-crafted questions, we quantify the presence of common persuasion principles in the email's content, producing prompted contextual document vectors for a downstream supervised machine learning model. We evaluate our method using a unique dataset generated by a proprietary system that automates target reconnaissance and spear-phishing email creation.

    "translated_abstract": "钓鱼网络攻击是一个重大的安全挑战，而大型语言模型（LLMs）通过生成令人信服的电子邮件并方便目标侦察来升级了威胁。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种基于新颖文档向量化方法的检测方法，该方法利用LLMs的集合来创建表示向量。通过提示LLMs来推理和回答人工制定的问题，我们量化电子邮件内容中常见说服原则的存在，为下游监督机器学习模型生成提示上下文文档向量。我们使用一个专有系统生成的独特数据集来评估我们的方法，该系统自动化目标侦察和钓鱼电子邮件的创建。我们的方法在仅包含传统钓鱼和良性电子邮件的训练集中实现了91%的F1得分，其中关键贡献包括一种创新的文档向量化方法。",
