    "translated_abstract": "即插即用（PnP）算法是一类迭代算法，通过结合物理模型和深度神经网络进行正则化来解决图像反演问题。尽管这些算法能够产生令人印象深刻的图像恢复结果，但它们依赖于在迭代过程中越来越少噪音的图像上的一种非标准的去噪器使用方法，这与基于扩散模型（DM）的最新算法相矛盾，在这些算法中，去噪器仅应用于重新加噪的图像上。我们提出了一种新的PnP框架，称为随机去噪正则化（SNORE），它仅在噪声水平适当的图像上应用去噪器。它基于显式的随机正则化，从而导致了一种解决病态逆问题的随机梯度下降算法。我们提供了该算法及其退火扩展的收敛分析。在实验上，我们证明SNORE在去模糊和修复任务上与最先进的方法相竞争。",
