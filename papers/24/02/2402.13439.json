Meat consumption plays a significant role in Canada's economy and is an important source of calories for the population. However, meat demand faces several consumption challenges due to logistic constraints, as a significant portion of the supply is imported from other countries. Therefore, there is a need for a better understanding of the causal relationships underlying lamb, beef, pork, and poultry consumption in Canada. Until recently, there have been no attempts to estimate meat consumption at the provincial level in Canada. Different Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) models have been applied for testing specifications to circumvent several econometric and theoretical problems. In particular, generalized AIDS and its Quadratic extension",

    "translated_abstract": "该论文调查了加拿大国内以及各省份对羊肉、牛肉、猪肉和禽肉的需求，以识别不同省份的肉类消费模式。肉类消费在加拿大经济中扮演着重要角色，并且是人口摄入热量的重要来源。然而，由于物流障碍，肉类需求面临着一些消费挑战，因为供应的大部分来自其他国家的进口。因此，有必要更好地理解加拿大羊肉、牛肉、猪肉和禽肉消费背后的因果关系。直到最近，还没有人尝试在加拿大省级水平上估算肉类消费量。另外，已应用不同的几个几乎理想需求系统（AIDS）模型来测试规范以规避几个计量经济学和理论问题。特别是，应用了广义AIDS及其二次扩展。",
