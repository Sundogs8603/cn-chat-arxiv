    "translated_abstract": "鉴于最近对具有预测作业大小的调度工作的研究，我们考虑了预测在排队系统中的成本影响，消除了先前研究中预测是外部资源和/或免费的假设。具体而言，我们引入了一种新颖的利用预测的方法，SkipPredict，旨在解决其固有的成本问题。我们建议的方法不是均匀地将预测应用于所有作业，而是根据预测要求将作业分为不同类别。为此，我们使用一位“廉价预测”来对作业进行分类，判断其是短作业还是长作业。SkipPredict将优先处理预测为短作业的作业，对于预测为长作业的作业，SkipPredict将应用第二轮更详细的“昂贵预测”来近似这些作业的最短剩余处理时间。我们的分析考虑了预测的成本。我们研究了这种成本对两个不同模型的影响。在外部成本模型中，预测的成本与作业的大小和调度时间有关。",

    "en_tdlr": "SkipPredict is a novel scheduling approach that addresses the cost of predictions. It categorizes jobs based on their prediction requirements and prioritizes short jobs, while using detailed predictions to approximate the shortest remaining processing time for long jobs. This methodology can be effectively applied in queueing systems."
