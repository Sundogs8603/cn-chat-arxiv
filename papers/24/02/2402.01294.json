In the context of an influence provider, if he provides more or less than an advertiser's demanded influence, it is a loss for him.

    "translated_abstract": "在典型的广告牌广告技术中，一个影响提供者拥有许多数字广告牌，许多广告商基于付费的方式向影响提供者请求他们广告内容的特定次数展示。如果影响提供者提供了所需或更多的影响力，那么他将获得全部付款，否则只能获得部分付款。对于一个影响提供者来说，如果他提供的影响力多于或少于广告商所需的影响力，这对他来说是一种损失。这被形式化为“遗憾”，自然而然地，在影响提供者的背景下，目标将是在广告商之间分配广告牌位置，以使总遗憾最小化。在本文中，我们将这个问题研究为一个离散优化问题，并提出了四种解决方案。第一种方法以增量贪婪的方式从可用的广告位中选择广告牌位置，我们称这种方法为“预算有效的贪婪”方法。",
