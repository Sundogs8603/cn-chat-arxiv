    "translated_abstract": "最近大型语言模型（LLMs）的进展正在重塑自然语言处理（NLP）领域的任务。它们在人力资源（HR）领域的应用仍有待扩展，并且可能对一些耗时的任务很有益。例如，休假申请、医疗索赔和访问权限申请都是值得注意的例子，但它们绝不是唯一的例子。然而，上述发展必须应对一个关键的挑战，即构建高质量的训练数据集。一方面，大多数对话数据集解决的是客户问题，而不是员工问题。另一方面，获取与HR的对话可能引起隐私问题。为了解决这个问题，我们介绍了HR-Multiwoz，这是一个完全标注的数据集，包含550个涵盖10个HR领域的对话，用于评估LLM Agent。我们的工作具有以下贡献：(1) 这是HR领域的首个开源对话数据集，用于NLP研究。(2) 它提供了一个标记的、面向NLP任务的HR对话数据集。",
