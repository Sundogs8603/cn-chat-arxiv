    "translated_abstract": "与传统的人工神经网络（ANN）相比，脉冲神经网络（SNN）因其更具生物启发和能量效率的信息传递能力而引起了广泛的学术兴趣。然而，尽管之前通过各种方法对SNN的学习梯度和模型结构进行了优化，但在性能方面SNN仍然在一定程度上落后于ANN。最近提出的多阈值模型为进一步增强SNN的学习能力提供了更多可能性。在本文中，我们从数学的角度严格分析了多阈值模型、原始脉冲模型和量化ANN之间的关系，然后提出了一种新的LM-HT模型，这是一个等距多层次模型，可以在时间维度上动态调节全局输入电流和膜电位泄漏。此外，我们指出基于LM-HT模型的直接训练算法可以无缝地连接两个阶段的学习。",
