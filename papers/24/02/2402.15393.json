However, these works are limited to symmetrical tasks, where the input and output dimensionalities are the same. To address this gap, we propose NeuralThink, a new recurrent architecture that can consistently extrapolate to both symmetrical and asymmetrical tasks, where the dimensionality of the input and output are different.

    "translated_abstract": "虽然机器学习方法擅长模式识别，但在可扩展的算法方式上处理复杂的推理任务时仍然面临困难。最近的深度思维方法展现了学习可以外推的算法的潜力：在较小的环境中学习并在较大的环境中执行学到的算法。然而，这些工作局限于对称任务，即输入和输出的维度相同。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了 NeuralThink，一种新的递归架构，可以一贯地对对称和不对称任务进行外推，其中输入和输出的维度不同。我们提供了一个新颖的不对称任务外推基准。我们展示了 NeuralThink 在稳定地从较小的训练规模对大观测进行外推方面一直优于之前的最先进的深度思维架构。",
