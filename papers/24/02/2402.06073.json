    "translated_abstract": "传统的时延神经网络(TDNN)在计算复杂度和推理速度方面取得了最先进的性能，使得它们在工业环境中难以实施。具有上下文感知屏蔽(CAM)模块的密集连通时延神经网络(D-TDNN)已经证明是一种降低复杂性并保持系统性能的高效结构。本文提出了一种快速轻量级模型LightCAM，它进一步采用了深度可分离卷积模块(DSM)和多尺度特征聚合(MFA)以实现不同层次的特征融合。在VoxCeleb数据集上进行了大量实验，比较结果表明它在VoxCeleb1-O上实现了0.83的等错误率(EER)和0.0891的最小检测代价因子(MinDCF)，超过了其他主流的说话人验证方法。此外，复杂度分析进一步证明了所提出的架构具有较低的计算成本和更快的推理速度。",
