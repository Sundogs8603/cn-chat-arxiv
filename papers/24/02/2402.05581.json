    "translated_abstract": "在低资源语言研究的高度约束背景下，我们通过使用预训练模型中的语音向量表示来确定它们相对于音频信号的抽象程度。我们提出了一种新的无监督方法，利用具有精心策划的元数据的音频录音进行ABX测试，以了解表示中存在的信息类型。ABX测试确定多语言语音模型计算的表示是否编码了给定的特征。我们设计了三个实验：一个关于房间声学特性，一个关于语言体裁，一个关于语音特征。结果证实，来自具有不同语言/非语言特性的录音的表示沿着相同的线路有所不同。将更多的音频信号嵌入一个向量中可以更好地区分非语言特征，而较短的片段可以更好地区分分段信息。该方法完全无监督，可能是一种从大规模数据集中获取音频表征的有效方法。",

Results from ABX tests confirm that the representations differ along the same dimensions for recordings with different linguistic and non-linguistic characteristics. The method is unsupervised and can be an effective approach to obtain audio representations from large-scale datasets."
