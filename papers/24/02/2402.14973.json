However, these benchmarks often struggle to keep pace with the rapidly advancing requirements of MLLM evaluation. We propose GenCeption, a novel and annotation-free MLLM evaluation framework that merely requires unimodal data to assess inter-modality semantic coherence and inversely reflects the models' inclination to hallucinate. Analogous to the popular DrawCeption game, GenCeption initiates with a non-textual sample and undergoes a series of iterative description and generation steps. Semantic drift across iterations is quantified using the GC@T metric. Our empirical findings validate GenCeption's efficacy, showing strong correlations with popular MLLM benchmarking results. GenCeption may be extended to mitigate training data contamination by utilizing ubiquitous, previously unseen unimodal data.",

    "translated_abstract": "多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）通常使用昂贵的带标注的多模态基准进行评估。然而，这些基准通常难以跟上MLLM评估的快速发展要求。我们提出了GenCeption，这是一个新颖的无需注释的MLLM评估框架，仅需要单模态数据来评估跨模态语义一致性，并反映出模型产生幻觉的倾向。类似于流行的DrawCeption游戏，GenCeption从一个非文本样本开始，并经历一系列迭代的描述和生成步骤。迭代之间的语义漂移使用GC@T指标进行量化。我们的实证发现验证了GenCeption的有效性，并显示出与流行的MLLM基准结果的强相关性。GenCeption可以通过利用普遍存在且以前未见的单模态数据来扩展，以减轻训练数据的污染。",
