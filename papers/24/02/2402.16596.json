Detecting and tracking semantic changes provides insights into the evolution of the language caused by changes in society and culture. Recently, several systems have been proposed to aid in this study, but all depend on manually annotated gold standard datasets for evaluation. In this paper, we present the first Slovene dataset for evaluating semantic change detection systems, which contains aggregated semantic change scores for 104 target words obtained from more than 3000 manually annotated sentence pairs. We evaluate several existing semantic change detection methods on this dataset and also propose a novel approach based on optimal transport that improves on the existing state-of-the-art systems with an error reduction rate of 22.8%.",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们专注于检测斯洛文尼亚语中的语义变化，这是一种拥有两百万使用者的资源较少的斯拉夫语言。检测和跟踪语义变化可以揭示语言的演变，这是由社会和文化变化引起的。最近，已经提出了几种系统来帮助这项研究，但所有这些系统都依赖于手动注释的黄金标准数据集进行评估。本文提出了第一个斯洛文尼亚语数据集，用于评估语义变化检测系统，其中包含了从3000多个手动注释的句对中获得的104个目标词的汇总语义变化评分。我们在这个数据集上评估了几种已有的语义变化检测方法，并提出了一种基于最优输运的新方法，该方法改进了现有的最先进系统，错误率降低了22.8%。",
