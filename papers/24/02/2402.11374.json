PBN procedures began to be implemented in Brazilian airspace in 2009 and represent a new concept of air navigation, using satellites to create 3D flight routes that are shorter and more precise, potentially reducing the distances flown and consequently flight times and delays. Flight times depend on various factors, such as the size and complexity of the origin and destination airports, weather conditions, aircraft models, and how full the flights are. Therefore, to assess the impact of the new procedures, the variation in this set of factors must be taken into account.

    "translated_abstract": "这项研究分析了影响巴西飞行时间的因素，特别关注新技术实施的影响，特别是基于性能的导航（PBN）。PBN程序始于2009年在巴西领空实施，代表了一种利用卫星创建3D飞行路线的新型航空导航概念，使飞行距离更短更精确，潜在地减少了飞行时间和延误。飞行时间取决于各种因素，如起飞和目的地机场的大小和复杂度，天气条件，飞机型号以及航班的满载情况。因此，为了评估新程序的影响，必须考虑这一系列因素的变化。",
