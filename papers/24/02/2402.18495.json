    "translated_abstract": "开放集图学习是一个实际的任务，旨在对已知分类节点进行分类，并将未知类别样本识别为未知。传统的节点分类方法通常在开放集场景下表现不佳，这是由于它们所遇到的复杂数据，如分布外（OOD）数据和分布内（IND）噪声。OOD数据是不属于任何已知类别的样本。如果它们在训练中出现（OOD噪声），在测试中出现则为开放集样本。IND噪声是被错误标记的训练样本。IND噪声和OOD噪声的存在是普遍的，通常会引起模糊问题，包括类内变化问题和类间混淆问题。因此，探索稳健的开放集学习方法是必要且困难的，对于非独立同分布的图数据来说更加困难。为此，我们提出了一个名为ROG$_PL$的统一框架。",
