    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.14460v1 公告类型：新的 摘要：主动推断是感知、学习和决策的一种领先理论，可以应用于神经科学、机器人技术、心理学和机器学习。主动推断基于预期自由能，其主要由直觉可信度来证明，例如风险加不确定性、信息增益/实用价值的公式。本文旨在形式化从单一根预期自由能定义中推导这些公式的问题，即统一问题。然后，我们研究了两种设置，每种设置都有自己的根预期自由能定义。在第一个设置中，迄今为止并未提出预期自由能的理由，但可以从中恢复所有公式。然而，在这种设置中，代理无法对观察具有任意的先验偏好。实际上，只有一类有限的先验偏好与观察是兼容的。",
