In this work, a novel myoelectric control paradigm -- on-demand myoelectric control -- is proposed, designed, and evaluated, to reduce the number of unrelated muscle movements that are incorrectly interpreted as input gestures . By leveraging the concept of wake gestures, users were able to switch between a dedicated control mode and a sleep mode, effectively eliminating inadvertent activations during activities of daily living (ADLs). The feasibility of wake gestures was demonstrated in this work through two online ubiquitous EMG control tasks with varying difficulty levels; dismissing an alarm and controlling a robot. The proposed control scheme was able to appropriately ignore almost all non-targeted muscular input",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，肌电控制作为一种可能的灵活、免提输入方式，受到了越来越多的研究关注。然而，在真实世界的条件下，当前的控制方法容易出现意外的虚假激活。本文提出、设计和评估了一种新颖的肌电控制范式——按需肌电控制，旨在减少错误地解释为输入手势的非相关肌肉运动的数量。通过利用唤醒手势的概念，用户能够在专用控制模式和睡眠模式之间进行切换，在日常生活活动中有效地消除意外激活。本研究通过两个在线普适肌电控制任务（关闭闹钟和控制机器人），展示了唤醒手势的可行性。所提出的控制方案几乎能够适当地忽略所有非目标肌肉输入。",
