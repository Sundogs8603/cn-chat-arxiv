    "abstract": "Different diseases, such as histological subtypes of breast lesions, have severely varying incidence rates. Even trained with substantial amount of in-distribution (ID) data, models often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) samples belonging to unseen classes in clinical reality. To address this, we propose a novel framework built upon a long-tailed OOD detection task for breast ultrasound images. It is equipped with a triplet state augmentation (TriAug) which improves ID classification accuracy while maintaining a promising OOD detection performance. Meanwhile, we designed a balanced sphere loss to handle the class imbalanced problem.",

    "translated_abstract": "不同的疾病，如乳腺病变的组织亚型，具有严重不同的发病率。即使通过大量的示踪数据进行训练，模型在临床实际中通常遇到属于未见类别的异常样本。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的框架，基于乳腺超声图像的长尾异常样本检测任务，并配备了一种三元状态增强（TriAug），它可以提高示踪分类的准确性，同时保持良好的异常样本检测性能。与此同时，我们设计了一个平衡的球形损失来处理类不平衡的问题。",
