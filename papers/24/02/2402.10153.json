Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for diabetes management, facilitating their efficacy. However, current LLM-based approaches are limited by their dependence on general sources and lack of integration with domain-specific knowledge, leading to inaccurate responses. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-infused LLM-powered conversational health agent (CHA) for diabetic patients. We customize and leverage the open-source openCHA framework, enhancing our CHA with external knowledge and analytical capabilities. This integration involves two key components: 1) incorporating the American Diabetes Association dietary guidelines and the Nutritionix information and 2) deploying analytical tools that enable nutritional intake calculation and comparison with the guidelines. We compare the proposed CHA with GPT4. Our evaluation includes 100 diabe",

    "translated_abstract": "有效的糖尿病管理对于糖尿病患者的健康至关重要。大型语言模型（LLM）为糖尿病管理开辟了新的途径，提高了其效果。然而，目前基于LLM的方法受限于对一般来源的依赖，缺乏与领域特定知识的整合，导致回复不准确。本文提出了一种知识注入的基于LLM的对话式健康代理（CHA）用于糖尿病患者。我们根据开源的openCHA框架进行定制，并增强了我们的CHA的外部知识和分析能力。这种整合包括两个关键组成部分：1）整合美国糖尿病协会的膳食指南和Nutritionix的信息；2）部署分析工具，实现营养摄入计算并与指南进行比较。我们将提出的CHA与GPT4进行比较。我们的评估包括100个糖尿病患者的使用情况。",
