We apply the modified estimator to model selection for German inflation rates after the introduction of the Euro. The results indicate that energy commodity price inflation and headline inflation are best described by stationary autoregressions.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新方法，通过使用自适应Lasso，在一致和奥拉克尔效率估计自回归模型时引入一个潜在非平稳回归变量的权重。增强的权重建立在一个统计量上，该统计量利用OLS估计器在时间序列回归中的概率顺序不同的特点，当积分程度不同时。我们在选择$\\ell_1$惩罚参数时提供了理论结果，证明了我们的方法在检测平稳性方面的优势。蒙特卡洛证据表明，我们的提议优于使用OLS基础权重，正如Kock建议的那样。我们将修改后的估计器应用于欧元推出后德国通货膨胀率的模型选择。结果表明，能源商品价格通货膨胀和整体通货膨胀最好由平稳自回归模型描述。",
