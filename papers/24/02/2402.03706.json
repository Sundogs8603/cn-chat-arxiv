    "translated_abstract": "为了应对小型无人机带来的不断变化的挑战，包括可能携带有害载荷或独立造成损害的潜力，我们引入了MMAUD: 一个全面的多模态反无人机数据集。MMAUD通过聚焦无人机检测、UAV类型分类和轨迹估计，弥补了当下威胁检测方法中的关键缺口。MMAUD通过结合立体视觉、各种激光雷达、雷达和声音阵列等多种感知输入，脱颖而出。它提供了比使用热像和RGB从特定视角捕捉的数据集更高保真度的独特的空中监测。此外，MMAUD提供了准确的Leica生成的真实数据，提高了可信度，并能够自信地改进算法和模型，这在其他数据集中从未出现过。大多数现有工作不会公开其数据集，使MMAUD成为一项无价的资源。",
