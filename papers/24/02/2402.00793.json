    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种将人类专业知识纳入算法预测的新框架。我们的方法主要关注利用人的判断力来区分那些对于任何可行的预测算法来说“看起来相同”的输入。我们认为，这种框架能够澄清人工智能与人类协作预测任务中的问题，因为专家通常具有信息的访问权限——特别是主观信息——而这些信息是算法训练数据中没有编码的。基于这一认识，我们开发了一组有原则的算法，仅在任何可行的预测器的性能有所改善时才选择性地纳入人类反馈。经验结果表明，尽管算法在平均水平上往往优于人类对应任务的能力，但人类判断在特定情况下（可以预先确定）能够显著提高算法预测的性能。在一个X射线分类任务中，我们发现这个子集在患者群体中占据了近30%。我们的方法提供了一种自然的方式，",
