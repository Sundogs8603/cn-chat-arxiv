In this framework, we propose sDM, a generic Bayesian approach designed for OPE and OPL, grounded in both algorithmic and theoretical foundations.

    "translated_abstract": "在交互式系统中，动作经常是相关的，这为大动作空间中更有效的离策略评估（OPE）和学习（OPL）提供了机会。我们引入了一个统一的贝叶斯框架，通过结构化和信息丰富的先验来捕捉这些相关性。在该框架中，我们提出了sDM，一个为OPE和OPL设计的通用贝叶斯方法，既有算法基础又有理论基础。值得注意的是，sDM利用动作相关性而不会影响计算效率。此外，受在线贝叶斯赌博机启发，我们引入了评估算法在多个问题实例中平均性能的贝叶斯指标，偏离传统的最坏情况评估。我们分析了sDM在OPE和OPL中的表现，凸显了利用动作相关性的好处。实证证据展示了sDM的强大性能。",
