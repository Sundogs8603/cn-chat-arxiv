    "translated_abstract": "胶质母细胞瘤是一种高度恶性的脑肿瘤，没有治疗的情况下预期寿命仅为3至6个月。准确检测和预测其生存和等级至关重要。本研究引入了一种使用迁移学习技术的新方法。通过详尽的优化，测试了各种预训练的网络，包括EfficientNet、ResNet、VGG16和Inception，以找到最适合的架构。迁移学习应用于对胶质母细胞瘤图像数据集进行微调，旨在实现两个目标：生存预测和肿瘤等级预测。实验结果显示，生存预测准确率达到65%，将患者分为短期、中期和长期生存类别。此外，肿瘤等级的预测准确率达到97%，准确区分低等级胶质母细胞瘤(LGG)和高等级胶质母细胞瘤(HGG)。这种方法的成功归因于迁移学习的有效性，超越了当前的研究水平。",
