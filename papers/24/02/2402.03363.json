    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种新颖的方法，结合机器学习和数论，在质数和非质数分类上进行研究。我们的研究核心是开发一种高度稀疏的编码方法，与传统的神经网络结构相结合。这种组合取得了令人满意的结果，在识别质数时达到了超过99\\%的召回率，在识别非质数时达到了79\\%的召回率，这些数字是从本质上不平衡的顺序整数序列中得出的，并且在完成单个训练周期之前迅速收敛。我们使用 $10^6$ 个整数进行训练，从指定的整数开始，然后在一个不同范围的 $2 \\times 10^6$ 个整数上进行测试，范围从 $10^6$ 到 $3 \\times 10^6$，偏移量相同。尽管受限于资源的内存容量，限制我们的分析跨越了 $3\\times10^6$，但我们认为我们的研究对机器学习在......的应用做出了贡献",
