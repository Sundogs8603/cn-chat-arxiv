To tackle this issue, in this paper, we identify the common key skills needed for these tasks from the view of taxonomy structures -- finding 'siblings' and finding 'parents' -- and propose a unified taxonomy-guided instruction tuning framework to jointly solve the three tasks. To be specific, by leveraging the existing taxonomy as a rich source of entity relationships, we utilize instruction tuning to fine-tune a large language model to generate parent and sibling entities.

    "translated_abstract": "实体集扩展、分类学扩展和种子引导分类学构建是三个代表性任务，可以用来自动向现有分类学填充新实体。然而，先前的方法通常使用异质技术分别解决这些任务，缺乏统一的视角。为了解决这个问题，在本文中，我们从分类学结构的视角确认了这些任务所需的共同关键技能——找到“兄弟”和找到“父母”，并提出了一个统一的基于分类学指导的指导调整框架来共同解决这三个任务。具体来说，通过利用现有分类学作为丰富的实体关系源，我们利用指导调整来微调大型语言模型，生成父母和兄弟实体。在多个基准数据集上的大量实验证明了TaxoInstruct的有效性，该方法在各项指标上均优于特定任务的基线方法。",
