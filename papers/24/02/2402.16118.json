    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.16118v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The majority of standard approaches to financial portfolio optimization (PO) are based on the mean-variance (MV) framework. Given a risk aversion coefficient, the MV procedure yields a single portfolio that represents the optimal trade-off between risk and return. However, the resulting optimal portfolio is known to be highly sensitive to the input parameters, i.e., the estimates of the return covariance matrix and the mean return vector. It has been shown that a more robust and flexible alternative lies in determining the entire region of near-optimal portfolios. In this paper, we present a novel approach for finding a diverse set of such portfolios based on quality-diversity (QD) optimization. More specifically, we employ the CVT-MAP-Elites algorithm, which is scalable to high-dimensional settings with potentially hundreds of behavioral descriptors and/or assets. The results highlight the promising features of QD as a novel tool in PO.",

    "translated_abstract": "大多数传统的金融投资组合优化方法基于均值-方差（MV）框架。在给定风险厌恶系数的情况下，MV程序会产生一个代表风险和回报之间最佳权衡的单一投资组合。然而，由此得到的最优投资组合据知对输入参数，即预期回报协方差矩阵的估计和平均回报矢量非常敏感。已经表明，一个更为稳健和灵活的替代方案在于确定整个近似最优投资组合区域。本文提出了一种基于质量-多样性（QD）优化找到多样化一组此类投资组合的新方法。具体而言，我们采用了适用于高维设置的CVT-MAP-Elites算法，可能具有数百个行为描述符和/或资产。结果突出了QD作为投资组合优化中的新工具的有前景特征。",
