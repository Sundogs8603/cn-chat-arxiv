Currently, there are limited interventions available for PICS. Studies indicate that exposure to visual art may help address the psychological aspects of PICS and be more effective if it is personalized. We develop Machine Learning-based Visual Art Recommendation Systems (VA RecSys) to enable personalized therapeutic visual art experiences for post-ICU patients. We investigate four state-of-the-art VA RecSys engines, evaluating the relevance of their recommendations for therapeutic purposes compared to expert-curated recommendations. We conduct an expert pilot test and a large-scale user study (n=150) to assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of these recommendations. Our results suggest all recommendations enhance temporal affective states. Visual and mul",

    "translated_abstract": "待在重症监护室（ICU）里经常会带来创伤，导致重症监护后综合征（PICS），包括身体、心理和认知障碍。目前，对于PICS，可用的干预有限。研究表明，接触视觉艺术可能有助于解决PICS的心理方面，如果个性化定制可能效果更佳。我们开发了基于机器学习的视觉艺术推荐系统（VA RecSys），为重症监护后患者提供个性化的治疗性视觉艺术体验。我们研究了四种最先进的VA RecSys引擎，评估了它们推荐的相关性，以治疗目的而言比较专家策划的推荐。我们进行了专家试点测试和大规模用户研究（n=150），以评估这些推荐的适当性和有效性。研究结果表明所有推荐均提升了时间情感状态。",
