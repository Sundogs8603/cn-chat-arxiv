Similar illusion also exhibited in Mandarin missing-NP double centre-embedded structures. However, there is no consensus on its very nature. Instead of treating it as grammaticality illusion, we argue that ambiguous interpretations of verbs can best account for this phenomenon in Mandarin. To further support this hypothesis, we conducted two electroencephalography (EEG) experiments on quasi double centre-embedded structures whose complexity is reduced by placing the self-embedding relative clauses into the sentence's subject position. Experiment 1 showed that similar phenomenon even exhibited in this structure, evidenced by an absence of P600 effect and a presence of N400 effect. In Experiment 2, providing semantic cues to reduce ambiguity dispelled this illusion, as evidenced by a P600 effect. We interpret the result",

    "translated_abstract": "在几种语言中，在双重中心嵌套结构中省略动词短语（VP）会产生一个语法性错觉。类似的错觉也表现在汉语缺失NP的双重中心嵌套结构中。然而，关于它的本质尚无共识。我们认为，与其把它看作是语法性错觉，不如将动词的歧义解释视为最能解释汉语中这一现象的方式。为了进一步支持这一假设，我们在减少复杂度的情况下进行了两项与自嵌入关系从句放置在句子主语位置相结合相近双中心嵌套结构的脑电图（EEG）实验。实验1表明，在这种结构中同样会表现出类似的现象，证据是缺少P600效应而存在N400效应。在实验2中，通过提供语义线索以减少歧义，消除了这种错觉，证据是存在P600效应。我们解释了这些结果",
