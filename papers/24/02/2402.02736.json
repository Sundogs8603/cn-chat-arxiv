    "abstract": "When enough annotated training data is available, supervised deep-learning algorithms excel at estimating human body pose and shape using a single camera. The effects of too little such data being available can be mitigated by using other information sources, such as databases of body shapes, to learn priors. Unfortunately, such sources are not always available either. We show that, in such cases, easy-to-obtain unannotated videos can be used instead to provide the required supervisory signals. Given a trained model using too little annotated data, we compute poses in consecutive frames along with the optical flow between them. We then enforce consistency between the image optical flow and the one that can be inferred from the change in pose from one frame to the next. This provides enough additional supervision to effectively refine the network weights and to perform on par with methods trained using far more annotated data.",

    "translated_abstract": "当有足够的带注释训练数据时，监督深度学习算法通过使用单个摄像机来估计人体姿势和形状。当这些数据不足时，可以通过使用其他信息源（如身体形状数据库）来学习先验知识来改进估计效果。然而，这种信息源也并不总是可用的。我们展示了在这种情况下，可以使用易获得的未注释视频来提供所需的监督信号。给定使用不足的带注释数据的训练模型，我们计算连续帧中的姿势以及它们之间的光流。然后，我们在图像光流和从一个帧到下一个的姿势变化中推断出的光流之间强制保持一致性。这提供了足够的附加监督来有效地优化网络权重，并与使用更多带注释数据训练的方法表现相当。",
