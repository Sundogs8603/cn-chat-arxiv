    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了扩散世界模型（DWM），这是一个条件扩散模型，能够同时预测多步的未来状态和奖励。与传统的一步动力学模型相反，DWM通过单个前向传递提供了长时程的预测，消除了递归查询的需要。我们将DWM整合到基于模型的价值估计中，其中短期回报通过从DWM中采样的未来轨迹进行模拟。在离线强化学习的背景下，DWM可以被视为通过生成建模来实现保守的值正则化。另外，它也可以被视为一种数据源，使离线Q学习能够使用合成数据。我们在D4RL数据集上的实验证实了DWM对长时程模拟的鲁棒性。在绝对性能方面，DWM显著超过了一步动力学模型，性能提高了44%，并达到了最先进的水平。",
