Extending a semi-parametric regression model based on asymmetric Laplace distribution, we propose a family of RES-CAViaR-oc models by adding overnight return and realized measures as a nowcasting technique for simultaneously forecasting Value-at-Risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES). We utilize Bayesian methods to estimate unknown parameters and forecast VaR and ES jointly for the proposed model family. We also conduct extensive backtests based on joint elicitability of the pair of VaR and ES during the out-of sample period.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究将实现波动率和隔夜信息纳入风险模型中，其中隔夜回报往往对总回报波动性贡献显著。在基于非对称拉普拉斯分布的半参数回归模型的基础上进行扩展，我们提出了一组RES-CAViaR-oc模型，通过添加隔夜回报和实现度量作为一种实时预测技术，同时预测风险价值(VaR)和预期损失(ES)。我们利用贝叶斯方法估计未知参数，并为所提出的模型家族联合预测VaR和ES。我们还进行了大量基于VaR和ES成对可引导性的后测验，以评估在样本外期间的绩效。我们对四个国际股指进行的实证研究证实隔夜回报和实现波动率在尾部风险预测中非常重要。",
