    "translated_abstract": "本研究对多个数据集和自然语言处理（NLP）任务中的文本增强技术进行了全面评估，以解决这些方法缺乏可靠、普遍证据的问题。它考察了这些技术在增强训练集以提高主题分类、情感分析和冒犯语言检测等任务性能方面的有效性。研究不仅强调了增强方法，还强调了在训练过程中引入真实和增强实例的战略顺序。研究的一个重要贡献是为增强数据集开发和评估了改进的循环课程学习（MCCL），这在该领域中属于一种新颖方法。结果表明，特定的增强方法，尤其是与MCCL结合使用时，能够显著优于传统的训练方法在NLP模型性能上的表现。这些结果强调了对可靠的增强方法和战略顺序的需求。",
