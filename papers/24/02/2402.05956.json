    "translated_abstract": "基于Transformer的模型在时间序列预测中取得了一些成功。现有的方法主要从有限或固定尺度对时间序列进行建模，这使得捕捉跨多个尺度的不同特征变得具有挑战性。本文提出了一种多尺度自适应路径（Pathformer）的Transformer模型。该模型同时整合了时间分辨率和时间距离进行多尺度建模。多尺度划分运用不同大小的数据块将时间序列分割成不同的时间分辨率。基于每个尺度的划分，对这些数据块进行双重注意力机制，以捕捉全局相关性和局部细节作为时间依赖关系。我们进一步通过自适应路径来丰富多尺度Transformer，该路径可以根据输入时间序列中不断变化的时间动态调整多尺度建模过程，提高Pathformer的预测准确性和泛化能力。在11个真实数据集上进行了大量实验。",
