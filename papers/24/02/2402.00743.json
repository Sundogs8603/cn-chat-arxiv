    "translated_abstract": "实践中观察到，基于Transformer的模型在推理阶段能够学习上下文中的概念。现有的文献，例如\\citet{zhang2023trained,huang2023context}对这种上下文学习能力提供了理论解释，但是他们假设每个样本的输入$x_i$和输出$y_i$都被嵌入到相同的令牌中（即结构化数据）。然而，在现实中，它们呈现为两个令牌（即非结构化数据\\cite{wibisono2023role}）。在这种情况下，本文进行了线性回归任务的实验，研究了Transformer架构的好处，并提供了一些相应的理论直觉，解释了为什么Transformer可以从非结构化数据中学习。我们研究了在Transformer中起到上下文学习作用的确切组件。特别地，我们观察到（1）带有两层softmax（自我）注意力和前瞻性注意力掩码的Transformer可以从提示中学习，如果$y_i$在令牌中。",
