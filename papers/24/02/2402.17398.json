    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文提出了Quantum-SMOTE方法，这是一种使用量子计算技术来解决机器学习数据集中普遍存在的类别不平衡问题的新颖解决方案。Quantum-SMOTE受到合成少数类过采样技术（SMOTE）的启发，利用量子过程如交换测试和量子旋转生成合成数据点。该方法与传统的SMOTE算法使用K-最近邻（KNN）和欧氏距离的方式有所不同，能够从少数类数据点生成合成实例而无需依赖于邻近性。算法通过引入旋转角度、少数类百分比和分裂因子等超参数，可以更好地控制合成数据生成过程，从而实现对特定数据集需求的定制。该方法在TelecomChurn公共数据集上进行了测试，并与两种主要的分类算法进行了评估。",
