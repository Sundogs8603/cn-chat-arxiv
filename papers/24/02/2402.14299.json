Future space exploration requires humans to work together with robots. However, acquiring proficient robot skills and adept collaboration under microgravity conditions poses significant challenges within ground laboratories. To address this issue, we develop a microgravity simulation environment and present three typical configurations of intra-cabin robots. We propose a hierarchical heterogeneous multi-agent collaboration architecture: guided by foundation models, a Decision-Making Agent serves as a task planner for human-robot collaboration, while individual Skill-Expert Agents manage the embodied control of robots. This mechanism empowers the SpaceAgents-1 system to execute a range of intricate long-horizon HMRC tasks.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出SpaceAgents-1，这是一个在微重力条件下学习人类与多机器人协作（HMRC）策略的系统。未来的太空探索需要人类与机器人共同工作。然而，在地面实验室中获得熟练的机器人技能和在微重力条件下的熟练协作面临着重大挑战。为了解决这个问题，我们开发了一个微重力模拟环境，并展示了三种典型的舱内机器人配置。我们提出了一个分层异构多代理协作架构：在基础模型的指导下，一个决策制定代理作为人机协作的任务规划者，而各个技能专家代理管理机器人的实体控制。这种机制使SpaceAgents-1系统能够执行一系列复杂的长期视野HMRC任务。",
