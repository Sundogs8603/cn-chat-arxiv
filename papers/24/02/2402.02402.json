    "translated_abstract": "本文分析了2001年至2021年期间西班牙国家最低工资的影响。最低工资从2001年的505.7欧元/月增加到2021年的1,108.3欧元/月。利用西班牙税务管理局提供的数据，可以分析代表整个人口的数据库。这些统计数据提供了更准确的结果和更高效的预测模型。本研究的特点在于使用的是全国人口普查数据，而不是样本或预测数据。因此，本研究基于西班牙薪资普查2001-2021年的历史数据，反映了结果和分析。各种机器学习模型表明，提高最低工资可以减少收入不平等。提高最低工资并未导致通胀或增加失业。相反，它与增加净就业、控制物价和增加企业利润率保持一致。最重要的结论是，在分析期间提高最低工资可以促进经济发展，增加福利。",
