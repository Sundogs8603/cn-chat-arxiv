    "translated_abstract": "学习图像压缩在实现超低比特率方面效率高，因此获得了广泛的应用。然而，包含大量文本内容的图像，特别是屏幕内容图像（SCI），经过这样的压缩后往往会出现文本失真。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新的文本logit损失，用于量化原始图像和重构图像之间的文本差异，从而提高重构文本的感知质量。通过在不同数据集上进行严格的实验，并采用先进的算法，我们的研究结果显示，将该损失函数与适当的加权相结合可以显著提高重构文本的质量。值得注意的是，通过应用文本logit损失函数，我们在两个屏幕截图数据集上获得了平均Bjontegaard delta (BD)为-32.64%的字符错误率（CER）和-28.03%的词错误率（WER）。此外，我们还提供了定量指标来衡量文本质量的改善程度。",
