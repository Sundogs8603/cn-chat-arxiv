    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11253v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: To align large language models with human preferences, existing research either utilizes a separate reward model (RM) to perform on-policy learning or simplifies the training procedure by discarding the on-policy learning and the need for a separate RM. In this paper, we present a novel alignment framework, SELF-JUDGE that is (1) on-policy learning and 2) parameter efficient, as it does not require an additional RM for evaluating the samples for on-policy learning. To this end, we propose Judge-augmented Supervised Fine-Tuning (JSFT) to train a single model acting as both a policy and a judge. Specifically, we view the pairwise judgment task as a special case of the instruction-following task, choosing the better response from a response pair. Thus, the resulting model can judge preferences of on-the-fly responses from current policy initialized from itself. Experimental results show the efficacy of SELF-JUDGE, outperforming baselines ",

    "translated_abstract": "为了使大型语言模型与人类偏好保持一致，现有研究要么利用单独的奖励模型（RM）执行基于政策的学习，要么通过放弃基于政策的学习和对独立RM的需求简化训练过程。在本文中，我们提出了一个新颖的对齐框架SELF-JUDGE，它既是(1) 基于政策的学习，又是(2) 参数高效的，因为它不需要额外的RM来评估样本进行基于政策的学习。为此，我们提出了增强式监督微调（JSFT）来训练一个单一模型，作为策略和评判器。具体来说，我们将一对一判断任务视为指导式任务的特殊情况，从响应对中选择更好的响应。因此，得到的模型可以评判当前策略的即时响应偏好，从自身初始化。实验结果显示了SELF-JUDGE的有效性，优于基线模型。",
