Recent work, e.g., Tree of Thoughts, has pointed out the importance of exploration and self-evaluation in reasoning step selection for complex problem solving. In this paper, we present Boosting of Thoughts (BoT), an automated prompting framework for problem solving with LLMs by iteratively exploring and self-evaluating many trees of thoughts in order to acquire an ensemble of trial-and-error reasoning experiences, which will serve as a new form of prompting to solve the complex problem.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种问题上的推理性能关键取决于思维链提示，其中包括在提示中提供一些思维链示范作为示例。最近的工作（例如Thought Tree）指出了在复杂问题解决的推理步骤选择中，探索和自我评估的重要性。在本文中，我们提出了一种名为Boosting of Thoughts（BoT）的自动提示框架，用于通过迭代地探索和自我评估许多思维树来获得一系列试错推理经验，这将作为解决复杂问题的新形式的提示。BoT从一个简单提示开始，无需示例，迭代地探索和评估大量的推理步骤，更重要的是，利用LLM获得的错误分析来明确修改提示。",
