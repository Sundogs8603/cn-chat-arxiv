    "translated_abstract": "自主实验（AE）目前的重点是开发有效进行AE的鲁棒工作流。这需要明确定义的方法来指导AE过程，包括超参数调整策略和工作流循环中的高级人员干预。本文通过分析自主扫描探针显微术中深度内核学习（DKL）的学习动力学，全面阐述了初始实验条件和循环干预对学习过程的影响。我们探讨了“种子效应”的概念，即初始实验设置对后续学习轨迹具有重要影响。此外，我们引入了AE中种子点干预的方法，使操作者能够影响探索过程。通过使用PbTiO3薄膜上的Piezoresponse力显微镜（PFM）数据集，我们展示了“种子效应”和循环种子干预对DKL的有效性的影响。",
