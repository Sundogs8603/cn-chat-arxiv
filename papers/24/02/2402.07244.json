    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种新型的人工免疫系统（AIS）：共生人工免疫系统（SAIS），灵感来自生物学中的共生关系。SAIS与Symbiotic Organisms Search（SOS）算法中的三个关键阶段（互惠主义、共生主义和寄生主义）相对应。这种并行方法有效地解决了AIS中大规模人口和增强人口多样性的挑战，传统的AIS和SOS在这方面的解决效率较低。我们进行了一系列的实验证明，我们的SAIS在26个基准问题上实现了与最先进的SOS方法相当的性能，并超过了其他常见的AIS方法和进化算法。此外，我们调研了参数选择问题，并发现SAIS在处理更大规模人口时表现更好，并且需要更少的迭代代数。最后，我们相信SAIS作为一种新的生物启发式和免疫启发式算法，有望在优化问题中发挥重要作用。",
