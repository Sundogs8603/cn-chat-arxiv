    "translated_abstract": "在某些领域中，数据的可用性是有限的，尤其是对于目标检测任务，需要正确标记每个目标周围的边界框。一个显著的例子是在海洋生物学领域，需要开发自动检测海洋物种用于环境监测的方法。为了解决数据限制问题，目前最先进的机器学习策略采用了两种主要方法。第一种方法是在现有数据集上预训练模型，然后推广到具体的领域。第二种策略是使用copy-paste技术或ad-hoc模拟器等方法创建特定于目标领域的合成数据集。第一种方法往往面临重大的领域转移问题，而第二种方法需要针对特定任务设计定制解决方案。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一个在通用情景下有效的迁移学习框架。",
