    "translated_abstract": "在无监督学习中，学习从图像中抽象概念的挑战在于需要将视觉感知和通用关系推理进行整合。此外，该任务的无监督性质使得人类用户需要能够理解模型学到的概念，并可能修正错误的行为。为了解决视觉概念学习的通用性和可解释性约束，我们提出了Pix2Code，这是一个将程序合成扩展到视觉关系推理的框架，利用了明确的、组合的符号和隐式的神经表示的能力。通过从图像中检索对象表示并将关系概念合成为lambda演算程序来实现这一点。我们在具有挑战性的推理领域Kandinsky Patterns和CURI上评估了Pix2Code的多样特性，从而测试其识别组合视觉概念并推广到新数据和推理任务的能力。",
