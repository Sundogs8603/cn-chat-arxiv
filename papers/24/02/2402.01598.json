    "translated_abstract": "高血压仍然是全球关注的健康问题，其患病率不断上升，因此需要有效的监测和理解血压动态。本研究深入探讨了从血压测量中获得的大量信息，这是了解高血压趋势的重要途径。许多研究已经报道了血压变化与各种因素的关系。在这项研究中，我们利用了一份涵盖了两个十年的7500万记录的庞大数据集，为探索和分析不同人群特征，如年龄、种族和性别之间的血压变化提供了独特机会。我们的研究发现，基于性别的血压变化在统计上并不显著，挑战了传统的假设。有趣的是，舒张压（SBP）随着年龄的增长而持续增加，而舒张压（DBP）在四十多岁的年龄组显示出一个独特的峰值。此外，我们的分析还揭示了分布模式中的一些有趣的相似性。",
