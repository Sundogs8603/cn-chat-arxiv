    "translated_abstract": "密切相关语言表现出语言上的相似性，使得一种语言的使用者能够理解另一种语言的说话者，而不需要主动学习。相互可理解程度因个体而异，通常在心理语言学实验中进行测试。为了计算研究相互可理解性，我们提出了一种计算辅助方法，使用线性判别学习器，这是一种用于逼近人类学习语言的认知过程的计算模型，我们还扩展了多语义向量和多声音类别。我们对来自德语、荷兰语和英语这三种密切相关的日耳曼语言的同源数据进行了模型测试。我们发现，我们的模型的理解准确度取决于1）词形的自动修剪和2）进行理解测试的语言对。我们的多语言建模方法不仅提供了自动测试语言间相互可理解性的新方法学发现",

    "en_tdlr": "This paper presents a computational model for assessing mutual intelligibility among closely related languages, which has been tested on German, Dutch, and English. The model utilizes the Linear Discriminative Learner and incorporates multilingual semantic vectors and sound classes. The study discovered that the accuracy of the model depends on word trimming and the language pair being tested. The proposed multilingual modeling approach offers new insights for automatic testing of mutual intelligibility across languages."
