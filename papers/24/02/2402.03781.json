    "translated_abstract": "分子关系学习（MRL）旨在理解分子之间的相互作用，在推进生物化学研究方面起到了关键作用。最近，大型语言模型（LLMs）的采用已成为一种有效和高效的MRL方法，这些模型以其庞大的知识存储库和先进的逻辑推理能力而闻名。尽管具有潜力，但这些方法主要依赖于文本数据，因此没有充分利用分子图中固有的丰富结构信息。此外，缺乏统一的框架加剧了信息的浪费，因为它阻碍了在不同数据集之间共享学习到的相互作用理由。为了解决这些挑战，本研究提出了一种基于LLM的多模态框架，用于根据思维链（CoT）理论对分子相互作用进行预测，称为MolTC，它可以高效地整合分子对的丰富图形信息。",
