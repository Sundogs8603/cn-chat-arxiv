In the present pilot study, the effect that the production rhythm (C1 - Slow, C2 - Fast, C3 - Adapted to the participant's pace) of a cobot has on the Experiential Locus of Control (ELoC) and the emotional state of 31 participants has been examined. The operators' performance, the degree of basic internal Locus of Control, and the attitude towards the robots were also considered. No difference was found regarding the emotional state and the ELoC in the three conditions, but considering the other psychological variables, a more complex situation emerges. Overall, results seem to indicate a need to consider the person's psychological characteristics to offer a differentiated and optimal interaction experience.",

    "translated_abstract": "在工业场景中，协作机器人（cobots）被广泛使用，并且对评估和测量cobots的某些特征对人的影响产生了日益增长的兴趣。在本次试点研究中，研究了一个cobots的生产节奏（C1-慢、C2-快、C3-根据参与者的步调调整）对31名参与者的经验性定位控制（ELoC）和情绪状态的影响。还考虑了操作人员的绩效、基本内部定位控制程度和对机器人的态度。关于情绪状态和ELoC，在三种条件下没有发现差异，但考虑到其他心理变量，出现了更复杂的情况。总体而言，结果似乎表明需要考虑个体的心理特征，以提供不同和最佳的互动体验。",
