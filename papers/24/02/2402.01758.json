We created Aalalp, a fine-tuned Mistral 7B model on instructions data related to specific Indian legal tasks. The performance of Aalap is better than gpt-3.5-turbo in 31\\% of our test data and obtains an equivalent score in 34\\% of the test data as evaluated by GPT4. Training Aalap mainly focuses on teaching legal reasoning rather than legal recall. Aalap is definitely helpful for the day-to-day activities of lawyers, judges, or anyone working in legal systems.",
