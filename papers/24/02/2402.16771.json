    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一个多对一的匹配市场，学院对学生的真实偏好进行共享，但只使用独立的嘈杂排名来做出决策。每个学生有一个真实价值$v$，但每个学院$c$根据独立抽取的估计价值$v + X_c$对学生进行排名，其中$X_c\\sim \\mathcal{D}.$ 我们提出了一个关于最终稳定匹配中匹配学生的噪声程度的基本问题：匹配学生时有多嘈杂？在大市场（即学生人数连续且学院数量众多）中可能出现两个引人注目的效应。当$\\mathcal{D}$的尾部轻时，噪声被完全衰减：只有价值最高的学生会被匹配。当$\\mathcal{D}$的尾部长时，噪声被完全放大：学生将以均匀随机的方式被匹配。这些结果适用于任何学生偏好分布的分布，同时也适用于只有学院子集同意真实学生估值而非整个市场的情况。更广泛地说，我们的研究拓展了有关匹配市场的传统对稳定性的探讨。",
