In comparison to the deep factorized model introduced in [1], our model achieves a lower cross entropy at a similar computational budget.

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一种轻量级、灵活且端到端可训练的概率密度模型，其由一个受限的Fourier基参数化。我们评估了该模型在逼近一系列多模态1维密度方面的表现，这些密度通常很难拟合。与[1]中引入的深度因式模型相比，我们的模型在类似的计算预算下实现了更低的交叉熵。此外，我们还在一个玩具压缩任务上评估了我们的方法，展示了其在学习压缩中的实用性。",
