    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在商业、工程和医学等领域被广泛应用，这些领域往往面临决策不确定性的问题，这是一个关键但具有挑战性的任务。本文表明，在决策问题上直接使用LLMs往往效果较差，尤其是在问题复杂性增加时。为了克服这个限制，我们提出了DeLLMa（Decision-making Large Language Model assistant）框架，旨在提高不确定环境下的决策精度。DeLLMa包括一个多步骤的脚手架程序，借鉴了决策理论和效用理论的原则，提供了一个最优的、可审计的决策过程。我们在涉及真实农业和金融数据的决策环境中验证了我们的框架。结果表明，DeLLMa可以显著提高LLMs的决策性能，准确性可提高高达40%以上。",
