Our data structure, named RobustSL, is a skip list augmented by predictions of access frequencies of elements in a data sequence. With proper predictions, RobustSL has optimal consistency (achieves static optimality). At the same time, it maintains a logarithmic running time for each operation, ensuring optimal robustness, even if predictions are generated adversarially. Therefore, RobustSL has all the advantages of the recent learning-augmented data structures of Lin, Luo, and Woodruff (ICML 2022) and Cao et al.

Numerical experiments show that RobustSL outperforms alternative data structures using both synthetic and real datasets.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了第一个具有最佳一致性和鲁棒性的学习增强数据结构来实现字典。我们的数据结构名为RobustSL，它是一个通过对数据序列中元素的访问频率进行预测而增强的跳表。通过恰当的预测，RobustSL可以实现最佳一致性（实现静态最优性）。同时，它能够保持每个操作的对数运行时间，确保最佳的鲁棒性，即使预测是以对抗性方式生成的。因此，RobustSL具有林、罗和伍德洛夫（ICML 2022）以及曹等人（arXiv 2023）最近提出的学习增强数据结构的所有优势，同时提供了在之前工作中缺失的鲁棒性保证。数值实验表明，RobustSL在使用合成数据集和真实数据集时优于替代数据结构。",
