    "translated_abstract": "在许多实际因果推断应用中，主要结果（标签）常常是部分缺失的，特别是如果它们很昂贵或很难收集。如果缺失依赖于协变量（即缺失不完全随机），仅基于完全观测样本的分析可能存在偏误。在这种情况下，结合与主要结果相关的完全观测的治疗后变量（替代结果）可以改进估计。在本文中，我们研究了替代结果在估计连续治疗效果中的作用，并提出了一种双重稳健方法，以高效地将替代结果纳入分析中，该方法使用了标记和未标记数据，并且不会受到上述选择偏误问题的影响。重要的是，我们建立了所提估计器的渐近正态性，并展示了与仅使用标记数据的方法相比，方差的可能改进。广泛的模拟显示我们的方法具有吸引人的经验性能。",
