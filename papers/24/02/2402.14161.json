    "translated_abstract": "我们推导了在局部波动率模型中，期权价格在新的短期极限$T\\to 0$下的短期渐近行为，其中固定$\\rho = (r-q)T$，其中$r$为利率，$q$为股利收益率。在实际情况中，$\\rho$很小，但我们的结果对于任何固定的$\\rho$都成立。结果是Berestycki-Busca-Florent公式的推广，用于隐含波动率的短期渐近行为，包括利率和股利收益效应的$O(((r-q)T)^n)$至$n$阶。我们在这个渐近极限下得到了ATM波动率和偏斜的解析结果。对CEV模型得到了显式结果。利用平方根模型$\\sigma(S)=\\sigma/\\sqrt{S}$，我们对渐近结果进行了数值测试，结果表明新的渐近结果在广泛的模型参数范围内与精确计算非常吻合。",
