We propose an approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based control for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Our approach conducts a concrete bridge deck survey while traffic is ongoing and detects cracks. The UAV performs the crack detection, and the location of cracks is initially unknown. We use two edge detection techniques. First, we use canny edge detection for crack detection. We also use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for crack detection and compare it with canny edge detection. Transfer learning is applied using CNN with pre-trained weights obtained from a crack image dataset. This enables the model to adapt and improve its performance in identifying and localizing cracks. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is applied for UAV control and bridge surveys. The experimentation across various scenarios is performed",

    "translated_abstract": "这项工作侧重于利用先进技术进行带有交通的桥梁结构健康监测（SHM）。我们提出了一种使用基于深度强化学习（DRL）的无人机（UAV）控制的方法。我们的方法在交通持续进行时进行混凝土桥面调查并检测裂缝。无人机执行裂缝检测，裂缝的位置最初是未知的。我们使用了两种边缘检测技术。首先，我们使用Canny边缘检测进行裂缝检测。我们还使用了卷积神经网络（CNN）进行裂缝检测，并将其与Canny边缘检测进行了比较。使用具有来自裂缝图像数据集的预训练权重的CNN进行迁移学习。这使模型能够适应并提高其在识别和定位裂缝方面的性能。应用Proximal Policy Optimization（PPO）进行UAV控制和桥梁调查。进行了跨不同场景的实验",
