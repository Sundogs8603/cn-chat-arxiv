    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2402.15073v1 公告类型：新的 摘要：算法性补救建议是向主体推荐一种成本高效的行动，以扭转不利的机器学习分类决策。文献中大多数现有方法在生成补救建议时都是基于对成本函数的完全了解这一假设。在现实世界的实践中，主体可能具有不同的偏好，导致对主体的基础成本函数存在不完整的信息。本文提出了一种将偏好学习整合到补救产生问题中的两步方法。在第一步中，我们设计了一个问答框架，以顺序地改进主体的马氏矩阵成本的置信区间。然后，我们通过利用基于梯度和基于图的成本自适应补救两种方法来生成补救建议，确保有效性的同时考虑成本矩阵的整个置信区间。数值评估证明了我们的方法相对于当前最先进的方法的优势。",
