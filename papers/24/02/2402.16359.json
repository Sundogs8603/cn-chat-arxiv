    "translated_abstract": "扩散模型在建模复杂数据分布方面表现出色，包括图像，蛋白质和小分子的分布。然而，在许多情况下，我们的目标是模拟最大化某些属性的分布的部分：例如，我们可能希望生成具有高审美质量的图像，或具有高生物活性的分子。自然地，我们可以将这视为一个强化学习（RL）问题，其目标是微调扩散模型以最大化与某些属性对应的奖励函数。即使可以访问地面真实奖励函数的在线查询，有效地发现高奖励样本也可能具有挑战性：它们在初始分布中的概率可能很低，并且可能存在许多不可行的样本，甚至没有定义良好的奖励（例如，不自然的图像或物理上不可能的分子）。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新颖的强化学习程序，可以高效地发现高奖励样本。",
