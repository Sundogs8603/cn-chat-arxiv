    "abstract": "arXiv:2402.11078v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Fine-tuning is dismissed as not effective for model editing due to its poor performance compared to more specialized methods. However, fine-tuning is simple, agnostic to the architectural details of the model being edited, and able to leverage ongoing advances in standard training methods (e.g., PEFT), making it an appealing choice for a model editor. In this work, we show that pure fine-tuning can be a viable approach to model editing. We propose a slight modification of naive fine-tuning with two key ingredients. First, we optimize the conditional likelihood rather than the full likelihood. Second, we augment the data with random paraphrases and facts to encourage generalization and locality. Our experiments on ZsRE and CounterFact show that this simple modification allows fine-tuning to often match or outperform specialized editors in the edit score.",

    "translated_abstract": "精细调整被认为在模型编辑中不够有效，因为相对更专业的方法而言，它的表现较差。然而，微调是简单的，不关心被编辑模型的体系结构细节，并且能够利用标准训练方法的不断进展（例如PEFT），使其成为模型编辑器的吸引选择。在本文中，我们展示了纯粹的微调可以是一种可行的模型编辑方法。我们提出了对朴素微调进行轻微修改的两个关键因素。第一，我们优化条件似然而非完整似然。第二，我们使用随机释义和事实来增加数据，以鼓励泛化和局部性。我们在ZsRE和CounterFact上的实验表明，这一简单修改使得微调通常可以与专业编辑器在编辑分数方面匹敌甚至超越。",
