    "translated_abstract": "LLM的蓬勃发展引发了LLM代理的快速发展。尽管LLM代理的基础是生成模型，但设计最佳推理策略和代理架构至关重要。因此，LLM代理研究从简单的思维链推进发展到更复杂的ReAct和Reflection推理策略；代理架构也从单一代理生成发展到多代理对话，以及多个LLM多代理组群聊。然而，由于现有复杂的框架和库，创建和评估新的推理策略和代理架构已成为一个复杂的挑战，这妨碍了LLM代理的研究调查。因此，我们开源了一个新的人工智能代理库，AgentLite，通过提供一个轻便、用户友好的平台，简化了这一过程，轻松创新LLM代理的推理、架构和应用。AgentLite是一个任务",
