While the recent works have addressed this question in the context of police-civilian interactions using police stop data, they have two key limitations. First, bias can only be properly quantified if true criminality is accounted for in addition to race, but it is absent in prior works. Second, law enforcement systems are multi-stage and hence it is important to isolate the true source of bias within the \"causal chain of interactions\" rather than simply focusing on the end outcome; this can help guide reforms. In this work, we address these challenges by presenting a multi-stage causal framework incorporating criminality. We provide a theoretical characterization and an associated data-driven method to evaluate (a) the presence of any form of racial bias, and (b) if so, the primary source of such a bias in terms of race and",

    "translated_abstract": "我们致力于开发一种数据驱动方法来评估执法系统中种族诱发的偏见。 在最近的研究中，已经讨论了在警民互动背景下使用警察停车数据解决这个问题，但存在两个关键限制。 首先，只有在将真实犯罪行为考虑在内时，偏见才能得到恰当量化，但在以前的研究中缺乏。 第二，执法系统是多阶段的，因此重要的是在“因果交互链”中孤立出偏见的真正来源，而不仅仅关注最终结果； 这有助于引导改革。 在这项工作中，我们通过提出一个包含犯罪行为的多阶段因果框架来解决这些挑战。 我们提供了一个理论特征和一个相关的数据驱动方法来评估(a)任何形式的种族偏见的存在，以及(b)如果是这样，这种偏见的主要来源是种族和...",
