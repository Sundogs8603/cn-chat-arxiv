    "translated_abstract": "警告：本论文包含针对边缘化群体的冒犯性语言示例。历史文本的数字化邀请研究人员用计算方法探索大规模历史文本语料库。本研究将计算文本分析应用于相对少有研究的话题：探究亚洲工人在美国历史报纸中的呈现方式。我们发现“苦力”一词在某些州（如马萨诸塞州、罗得岛州、怀俄明州、俄克拉荷马州和阿肯色州）的语义不同，不同的话语围绕着“苦力”。我们还发现，当时的南方联邦报纸和北方联邦报纸通过测量过度代表的词形成了独特的话语。来自南方联邦的报纸将苦力与与奴隶制有关的词语联系在一起。此外，我们发现亚洲人被认为低于欧洲移民，并受到种族主义的攻击。本研究有助于补充定性研究，提供对历史报纸中亚洲工人呈现方式的定量分析。",
