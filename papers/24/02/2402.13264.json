    "translated_abstract": "故障定位在在线微服务中具有挑战性，因为监控数据的数量、类型、事件以及服务和组件之间复杂的相互依赖性多种多样。服务中的故障事件是具有传播性的，可以在短时间内触发一系列警报。在工业界，故障定位通常由经验丰富的人员手动进行。这种依赖于经验的方式不可靠且缺乏自动化。不同的模块在手动定位过程中存在信息障碍，使得在紧急故障期间很难快速对齐。这种低效导致了稳定性保证滞后，无法及时最小化故障检测和修复时间。虽然已经有可操作的方法旨在自动化这个过程，但准确性和效率仍不尽如人意。故障定位结果的精确性非常重要，因为它为工程师对从多个方面得出的诊断结论的信任奠定了基础。",
