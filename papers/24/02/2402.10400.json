We explore causal language models as rule-based reasoners, specifically with respect to compositional rules - rules consisting of multiple elements which form a complex logical expression. Reasoning about compositional rules is challenging because it requires multiple reasoning steps, and attending to the logical relationships between elements. We introduce a new prompting method, Chain of Logic, which elicits rule-based reasoning through decomposition (solving elements as independent threads of logic), and recomposition (recombining these sub-answers to resolve the underlying logical expression).

    "translated_abstract": "基于规则的推理是一种基本的法律推理类型，它使我们能够通过准确地将规则应用于一组事实来得出结论。我们探讨了因果语言模型作为基于规则的推理者，特别是关于组合规则 - 由多个元素组成形成复杂逻辑表达式的规则。推理组合规则具有挑战性，因为它需要多个推理步骤，并且需要关注元素之间的逻辑关系。我们引入了一种新的提示方法，逻辑链，通过分解（将元素作为独立的逻辑线索解决）和重新组合（重新组合这些子答案以解决潜在的逻辑表达式）。这种方法受到了IRAC（问题、规则、应用、结论）框架的启发，这是律师使用的一种序贯推理方法。我们在八个基于规则的推理任务中评估了逻辑链。",
