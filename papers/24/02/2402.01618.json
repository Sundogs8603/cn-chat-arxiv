    "abstract": "This research explores strategies for steering the output of large language models (LLMs) towards specific styles, such as sentiment, emotion, or writing style, by adding style vectors to the activations of hidden layers during text generation. We show that style vectors can be simply computed from recorded layer activations for input texts in a specific style in contrast to more complex training-based approaches. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of activation engineering using such style vectors to influence the style of generated text in a nuanced and parameterisable way, distinguishing it from prompt engineering. The presented research constitutes a significant step towards developing more adaptive and effective AI-empowered interactive systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了通过在文本生成过程中将风格向量添加到隐藏层激活中，来引导大型语言模型（LLM）输出特定风格（如情感、情绪或写作风格）的策略。与更复杂的训练方法相比，我们表明可以从记录的层激活中简单地计算出特定风格的风格向量。通过一系列实验，我们展示了使用这样的风格向量来影响生成文本的风格的激活工程的有效性，这种方法具有细致和可参数化的特点，区别于提示工程。所展示的研究是向更具适应性和有效性的AI驱动交互系统发展迈出的重要一步。",
