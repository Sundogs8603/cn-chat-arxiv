    "translated_abstract": "可扩展的图神经网络（GNN）已成为一种有前景的技术，在许多大规模基于图的Web应用中展现出卓越的预测性能和高效运行效率。然而，大多数可扩展的GNN倾向于以相同的传播规则处理图中的所有节点，忽视了它们的拓扑独特性；现有的节点级传播优化策略在复杂的Web规模图中效果不佳，需要对节点的局部属性进行全面描绘。直观地说，Web规模图中的不同节点具有不同的拓扑角色，因此无差别地传播或忽视局部上下文可能会影响节点表示的质量。小规模情景无法匹配Web规模图中的这种复杂拓扑。为了解决上述问题，我们提出了适应性拓扑感知传播（ATP）方法，减少潜在的高偏差传播和额外开销。",
