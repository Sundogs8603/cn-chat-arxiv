    "translated_abstract": "检索增强语言模型（RALMs）已经在通过从外部来源检索证据来优化和扩展其内部记忆方面表现出重要潜力。然而，RALMs在将内部记忆与外部来源整合时必然会遇到知识冲突。知识冲突会使RALMs陷入知识之间的拉锯战，限制其实际应用。本文着重于探索和解决RALMs中的知识冲突。首先，我们提出了一个评估框架，用于评估不同维度上的知识冲突。然后，我们从以下两个角度研究了RALMs的行为和偏好：（1）内部记忆与外部来源之间的冲突：我们发现，随着邓宁-克鲁格效应的增强，更强大的RALMs会持续偏爱其错误的内部记忆，即使提供了正确的证据。此外，RALMs还表现出一种可用性",
