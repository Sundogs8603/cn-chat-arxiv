    "title": "Focal Modulation Networks for Interpretable Sound Classification",
    "abstract": "The increasing success of deep neural networks has raised concerns about their inherent black-box nature, posing challenges related to interpretability and trust. While there has been extensive exploration of interpretation techniques in vision and language, interpretability in the audio domain has received limited attention, primarily focusing on post-hoc explanations. This paper addresses the problem of interpretability by-design in the audio domain by utilizing the recently proposed attention-free focal modulation networks (FocalNets). We apply FocalNets to the task of environmental sound classification for the first time and evaluate their interpretability properties on the popular ESC-50 dataset. Our method outperforms a similarly sized vision transformer both in terms of accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, it is competitive against PIQ, a method specifically designed for post-hoc interpretation in the audio domain.",

    "translated_abstract": "深度神经网络的不断成功引发了与其黑盒本质相关的可解释性和信任的问题。虽然在视觉和语言领域对解释技术进行了广泛探索，但在音频领域的可解释性却受到了有限的关注，主要集中在事后解释上。本文通过利用最近提出的无注意力焦点调制网络（FocalNets），在音频领域中首次应用FocalNets来解决可解释性的问题。我们将FocalNets应用于环境声音分类任务，并在流行的ESC-50数据集上评估其可解释性。我们的方法在准确性和可解释性方面均优于类似大小的视觉变换器。此外，与专门用于音频领域事后解释的PIQ方法相比，我们的方法也具有竞争力。",
