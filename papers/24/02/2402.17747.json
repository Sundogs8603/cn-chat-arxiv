    "translated_abstract": "强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）的过去分析假设人类完全观察到环境。当人类反馈仅基于部分观察时会发生什么？我们对两种失败情况进行了正式定义：欺骗和过度辩护。通过将人类建模为对轨迹信念的Boltzmann-理性，我们证明了RLHF保证会导致策略欺骗性地夸大其性能、为了留下印象而过度辩护或者两者兼而有之的条件。为了帮助解决这些问题，我们数学地刻画了环境部分可观测性如何转化为（缺乏）学到的回报函数中的模糊性。在某些情况下，考虑环境部分可观测性使得在理论上可能恢复回报函数和最优策略，而在其他情况下，存在不可减少的模糊性。我们警告不要盲目应用RLHF在部分可观测情况下。",
