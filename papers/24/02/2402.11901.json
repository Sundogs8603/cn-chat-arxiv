    "translated_abstract": "人工智能规划的实际应用通常需要一个高度表达力的建模语言，以精确捕捉目标系统的重要复杂性。混合系统在现实世界中随处可见，而PDDL+是捕捉此类系统作为规划领域的标准化建模语言。PDDL+使得能够准确编码混合离散-连续系统动态、外生活动以及在实际场景中展示的许多其他有趣特性成为可能。然而，由于PDDL+规划软件的普遍短缺和少数现有规划器的严格限制，PDDL+的使用情况一直较为缓慢和犹豫不决。为了克服这一分歧，我们提出了Nyx，这是一种强调轻巧、简单和最重要的适应性的新型PDDL+规划器。该规划器被设计为可以轻松定制，扩展其能力远远超出PDDL+的范围。因此，Nyx可以根据需要定制实现几乎",
