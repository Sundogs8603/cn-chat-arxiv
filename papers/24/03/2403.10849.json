Recent research has shown that while these can be adapted to detect unaswerability with suitable training and thresholding, this comes at the expense of accuracy for answerable questions, and no single model is able to handle all categories of unanswerability. We propose a new model for KBQA named RetinaQA that is robust against unaswerability. It complements KB-traversal based logical form retrieval with sketch-filling based logical form construction. This helps with questions that have valid logical forms but no data paths in the KB leading to an answer.

    "translated_abstract": "最先进的知识库问答（KBQA）模型通常假定问题是可回答的。然而，最近的研究表明，虽然这些模型可以通过适当的训练和阈值设定适应检测不可回答性，但这将以牺牲可回答问题的准确性为代价，且没有单一模型能够处理所有不可回答性类别。我们提出了一种名为RetinaQA的新型KBQA模型，它对不可回答性具有鲁棒性。它将基于KB遍历的逻辑形式检索与基于填图的逻辑形式构建相结合。这有助于处理具有有效逻辑形式但在知识库中没有通向答案的数据路径的问题。此外，它使用辨别而非生成来更好地识别没有有效逻辑形式的问题。我们展示了RetinaQA在可回答和不可回答问题上显着优于最先进的KBQA模型的调整，并且在不可回答性类别上显示出鲁棒性。",
