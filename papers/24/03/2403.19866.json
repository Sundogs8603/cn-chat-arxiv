    "translated_abstract": "合成图像数据生成代表了训练深度学习模型的一个有前景的途径，特别是在迁移学习领域，因为在特定领域获取真实图像可能会由于隐私和知识产权考虑而变得代价高昂。本研究深入探讨了从文本到图像生成模型中获取的合成图像的生成和利用，以促进迁移学习范式。尽管生成的图像具有高度的视觉逼真度，但我们观察到，将这些图像天真地纳入现有的真实图像数据集并不能始终提升模型性能，这是由于合成图像和真实图像之间固有的分布差异所致。为了解决这个问题，我们引入了一种名为“桥接迁移”的新颖的两阶段框架，该框架首先利用合成图像对预训练模型进行微调以提高其可迁移性，随后使用真实数据进行快速适应。",
