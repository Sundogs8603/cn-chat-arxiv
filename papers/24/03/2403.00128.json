    "translated_abstract": "颠倒降落是许多飞行动物常见的行为。然而，对于机器飞行器来说，掌握这项技能尤为具有挑战性，特别是要执行快速身体旋转（或翻转）并在重力作用下着陆的动态停泊。蝇类的颠倒降落表明，光流感应与精确触发和控制导致各种成功着陆行为的身体翻转是密切相关的。在这一基础上，我们旨在通过开发一个适用于任意天花板接近条件的控制策略，来复制蝇类的着陆行为在小型四轴飞行器上。首先，我们在模拟环境中采用强化学习来优化整个光流空间的多个天花板接近速度和方向下的离散感知-运动对。接下来，我们将感知-运动对转换为在连续增强光流空间中的两阶段控制策略。这个控制策略包含了",
