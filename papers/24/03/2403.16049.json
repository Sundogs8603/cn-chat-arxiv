Predicting rental and return patterns at bicycle stations remains a formidable task due to the system's openness and imbalanced usage patterns across stations.

    "translated_abstract": "在各个领域预测时间模式面临着重大挑战，因为它们的轨迹细微且经常是非线性的。为了解决这一挑战，预测框架不断被完善，采用数据驱动的统计方法、数学模型和机器学习方法。最近，作为一个具有挑战性的系统之一，共享交通系统如共享单车由于城市约束和环境问题而备受关注。由于系统的开放性和各站点之间的使用模式不平衡，预测单车站点的租借和归还模式仍然是一项艰巨的任务。在本研究中，我们提出了一个深度学习框架，通过利用卡托图方法来预测租借和归还模式。卡托图方法有助于对新安装站点的需求进行预测，这些新站点没有训练数据，同时实现了长期预测，这是以前尚未实现的。",
