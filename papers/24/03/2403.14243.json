However, the vast complexity of all medical domains require a more complex approach that combines machine learning algorithms, classifiers, segmentation algorithms and, lately, large language models. In this paper, we describe, implement and assess an Artificial Intelligence-empowered system and methodology aimed at assisting the diagnosis process of skin lesions and other skin conditions within the field of dermatology that aims to holistically address the diagnostic process in this domain. The workflow integrates large language, transformer-based vision models and sophisticated machine learning tools.
