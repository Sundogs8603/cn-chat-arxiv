    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.08475v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In recent years, the DBLP computer science bibliography has been prominently used for searching scholarly information, such as publications, scholars, and venues. However, its current search service lacks the capability to handle complex queries, which limits the usability of DBLP. In this paper, we present NLQxform-UI, a web-based natural language interface that enables users to query DBLP directly with complex natural language questions. NLQxform-UI automatically translates given questions into SPARQL queries and executes the queries over the DBLP knowledge graph to retrieve answers. The querying process is presented to users in an interactive manner, which improves the transparency of the system and helps examine the returned answers. Also, intermediate results in the querying process can be previewed and manually altered to improve the accuracy of the system.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，DBLP计算机科学文献目录已被广泛用于搜索学术信息，如出版物、学者和会议。然而，其当前的搜索服务缺乏处理复杂查询的能力，这限制了DBLP的可用性。本文提出了NLQxform-UI，这是一个基于web的自然语言接口，允许用户直接用复杂自然语言问题查询DBLP。NLQxform-UI会自动将给定问题转换为SPARQL查询，并在DBLP知识图上执行查询以检索答案。查询过程以交互方式呈现给用户，提高了系统的透明度并有助于检查返回的答案。此外，查询过程中的中间结果可以预览和手动修改以提高系统的准确性。NLQxform-UI已完全开源：https://github.com/ruijie-wan",
