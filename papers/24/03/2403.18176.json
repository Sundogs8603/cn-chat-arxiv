The learner seeks to predict the agent's true label given access to only the manipulated features. After the learner releases their prediction, the agent's true label is revealed. Previous algorithms such as the strategic perceptron guarantee finitely many mistakes under a margin assumption on agents' true feature vectors. However, these are not guaranteed to encourage agents to be truthful. Promoting truthfulness is intimately linked to obtaining adequate margin on the predictions, thus we provide two new algorithms aimed at recovering the maximum margin classifier in the presence of strategic agent behavior. We prove convergence, finite mistake and finite manipulation guarantees for a variety of agent cost struct",

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了一个在线战略分类问题，其中每个到达的代理可以操纵他们真实的特征向量以获取一个正预测标签，同时承担取决于操纵量的成本。学习者试图在只有操纵特征的情况下预测代理的真实标签。在学习者发布他们的预测后，代理的真实标签会被揭示。先前的算法如战略感知器在关于代理真实特征向量的边际假设下保证了有限的错误次数。然而，这些算法并不能保证鼓励代理诚实。促进诚实与获得充足边际的预测密切相关，因此我们提供了两个旨在在存在战略代理行为的情况下恢复最大边际分类器的新算法。我们证明了多种代理成本结构下的收敛性、有限错误和有限操纵保证。",
