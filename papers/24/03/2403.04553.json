MLCommons is a consortium that develops and maintains several scientific benchmarks that can benefit from developments in AI. We provide a description of the cloud-masking benchmark task, updated code, and the best model for this benchmark when using our selected hyperparameter settings. Our benchmarking results include the highest accuracy achieved on the NYU system as well as the average time taken for both training and inference on the benchmark across several runs/seeds. Our code can be found on GitHub. MLCommons team has been kept informed about our progress and may use the developed code for their future work.",
