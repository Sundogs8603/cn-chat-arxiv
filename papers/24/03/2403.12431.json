    "translated_abstract": "Stereophotogrammetry是一种新兴的场景理解技术。其起源可以追溯到至少19世纪，当时人们开始研究使用照片来测量世界的物理属性。自那时以来，已经探索了成千上万种方法。经典几何技术的Shape from Stereo建立在使用几何来定义场景和摄像机几何的约束，然后解决非线性方程组。更近期的工作采用了完全不同的方法，使用端到端的深度学习而没有明确建模几何。在这项调查中，我们探讨了基于几何和基于深度学习框架的重叠部分。我们比较和对比了集成到深度学习框架中用于深度估计或其他密切相关问题的几何强制约束。我们提出了一种新的分类法，用于描述现代深度学习中使用的普遍几何约束。",
