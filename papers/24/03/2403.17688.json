Considering its crucial role in RSs, one key challenge in enhancing RSs with LLMs lies in providing better collaborative filtering information through LLMs. In this paper, drawing inspiration from the in-context learning and chain of thought reasoning in LLMs, we propose the Large Language Models enhanced Collaborative Filtering (LLM-CF) framework, which distils the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs",

    "translated_abstract": "最近，大型语言模型（LLM）的最新进展吸引了研究人员的广泛兴趣，他们利用这些模型来增强推荐系统（RS）。现有工作主要利用LLM生成知识丰富的文本，或者利用LLM衍生的嵌入作为特征来改进RS。虽然LLM中包含的广泛世界知识通常有利于RS，但该应用只能接受有限数量的用户和项目作为输入，没有充分利用协同过滤信息。考虑到协同过滤在RS中的关键作用，利用LLM增强RS的一个关键挑战在于通过LLM提供更好的协同过滤信息。在本文中，我们从LLM中的上下文学习和思维链推理中汲取灵感，提出了大型语言模型增强协同过滤（LLM-CF）框架，该框架提炼了LLMs的世界知识和推理能力",
