We model the design of this study after the exercises artists use by looking at amorphous ink splotches for creative inspiration. Our goal is to determine whether AI-assistance can improve, hinder, or provide an alternative quality to games when compared to the creative intents implemented by human designers. The capabilities of LLMs as game designers are stress tested by placing it at the forefront of the decision making process. Three prototype games are designed across 3 different genres: (1) a minimalist base game, (2) a game with features and game feel elements added by a human game designer, and (3) a game with features and feel elements directly implemented from prompted outputs of the LLM, ChatGPT.

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何作为有效的高层次创意合作者和游戏设计的“灵感泉源”。我们通过模仿艺术家使用的练习，即观看无定形的墨迹斑点以获得创意灵感，来构建这项研究的设计。我们的目标是确定人工智能辅助相对于人类设计师的创造意图实施时，是否可以改善、阻碍或提供另一种游戏质量。LLMs作为游戏设计师的能力通过将其置于决策过程的前沿来进行压力测试。在3个不同的流派中设计了三款原型游戏：（1）极简基础游戏，（2）由人类游戏设计师添加功能和游戏感元素的游戏，以及（3）从ChatGPT提示的输出直接实现功能和感觉元素的游戏。进行了用户研究，并要求参与者盲目评估游戏的质量和它们...",
