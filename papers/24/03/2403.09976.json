    "translated_abstract": "基于模型的方法在区分视觉控制中的任务不相关干扰因素方面做出了显著贡献。然而，先前的研究主要集中在异质干扰因素，如嘈杂的背景视频上，对密切类似可控制代理的均质干扰因素的研究很少，这给现有方法带来了重大挑战。为解决这一问题，我们提出了隐式动作生成器（IAG）来学习视觉干扰因素的隐式动作，并提出了一种名为隐式动作通知的多样化视觉干扰因素区分器（AD3）的新算法，利用IAG推断的动作来训练分离的世界模型。隐式动作有效地捕捉了背景干扰因素的行为，有助于区分任务不相关的组件，代理可以优化任务相关状态空间内的策略。我们的方法在各种视觉控制任务中表现出优越性能。",
