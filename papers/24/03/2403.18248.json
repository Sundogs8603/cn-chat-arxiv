    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们提出了一种用于解决统计最优分配问题的函数可微方法。通过对排序运算符的一般属性进行详细分析，我们首先推导出了值函数的Hadamard可微性。在我们的框架中，Hausdorff测度的概念以及几何测度论中的面积和共面积积分公式是核心。基于我们的Hadamard可微性结果，我们展示了如何利用函数偏微分法直接推导出二元约束最优分配问题的值函数过程以及两步ROC曲线估计量的渐近性质。此外，利用对凸和局部Lipschitz泛函的深刻见解，我们得到了最优分配问题的值函数的额外一般Frechet可微性结果。这些引人入胜的发现激励了我们",
