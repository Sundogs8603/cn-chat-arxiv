    "translated_abstract": "创建控制方法以模拟人工智能（AI）中的神经退行对于模拟大脑功能下降和认知障碍的应用至关重要。我们利用大型语言模型（LLMs）执行的智商测试，特别是LLaMA 2，引入了“神经侵蚀”的概念。这种有意的侵蚀涉及在训练期间或之后切除突触或神经元，或添加高斯噪声，导致LLMs表现的逐渐下降。我们能够描述智商测试中的神经退行，并显示LLM首先失去其数学能力，然后失去其语言能力，同时进一步失去理解问题的能力。据我们所知，这是首个使用文本数据建模神经退行的工作，与在计算机视觉领域进行操作的其他工作相比。最后，我们对我们的研究与认知进行相似性的研究进行了对比。",
    "tldr": "这项研究介绍了一种在人工智能系统中模拟受控神经退行的新方法，通过在LLMs中添加噪音或切除神经元来逐渐降低其性能，在智商测试中展示了神经退行的过程，并与传统的计算机视觉领域不同，是首个使用文本数据模拟神经退行的工作。",
    "en_tdlr": "This study introduces a new method to simulate controlled neurodegeneration in AI systems, gradually reducing the performance by adding noise or ablating neurons in LLMs, depicting the process of neurodegeneration in IQ tests, and is the first to model neurodegeneration with text data compared to traditional works in computer vision."
