We integrate observation and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) points into a meteorological graph, extracting $k$-hop subgraphs centered on NWP points. Self-supervised GNNs are employed to estimate the atmospheric state by aggregating data within these $k$-hop radii. The study applies gradient-based explainability methods to quantify the significance of different observations in the estimation process. Evaluated with data from 11 satellite and land-based observations, the results highlight the effectiveness of visualizing the importance of observation types, enhancing the understanding and optimization of observational data in weather forecasting.",
