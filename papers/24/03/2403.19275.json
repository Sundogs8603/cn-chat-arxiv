However, there are still two key problems in existing works: the agent possesses world knowledge that does not belong to its personas, and it cannot eliminate the interference of diverse persona information on current actions, which reduces the personalization and anthropomorphism of the agent. To solve the above problems, we construct the social media agent based on personalized knowledge and dynamic persona information. For personalized knowledge, we add external knowledge sources and match them with the persona information of agents, thereby giving the agent personalized world knowledge. For dynamic persona information, we use current action information to internally retrieve the persona information of the agent, thereby reducing the interference of diverse persona information on the current action.

    "translated_abstract": "构建个性化和拟人化代理在社交网络模拟中具有重要意义。然而，现有作品中仍存在两个关键问题：代理拥有不属于其角色的世界知识，不能消除多样化角色信息对当前行为的干扰，从而降低了代理的个性化和拟人化。为了解决以上问题，我们基于个性化知识和动态角色信息构建社交媒体代理。对于个性化知识，我们添加外部知识源并将其与代理的角色信息匹配，从而赋予代理个性化的世界知识。对于动态角色信息，我们使用当前行为信息内部检索代理的角色信息，从而减少多样化角色信息对当前行为的干扰。",
