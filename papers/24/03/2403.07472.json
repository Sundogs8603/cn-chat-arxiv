Traditionally limited by a scarcity of species observations, these models have significantly improved in performance through the integration of larger datasets provided by citizen science initiatives. However, they still suffer from the strong class imbalance between species within these datasets, often resulting in the penalization of rare species--those most critical for conservation efforts.

    "translated_abstract": "由于生物多样性显著下降，物种分布模型（SDMs）对于通过将环境条件与物种出现地联系起来，理解气候变化对物种栖息地的影响至关重要。一直以来，由于物种观察的稀缺性受到限制，这些模型通过整合公民科学倡议提供的更大数据集而得到显著改进。然而，它们仍然受到数据集中物种之间强烈的类别不平衡问题的困扰，这往往导致对稀有物种（对保护工作至关重要的物种）的惩罚。为解决这一问题，本研究评估了使用平衡的存在-仅损失函数在大型基于公民科学的数据集上训练深度学习模型的有效性。我们展示了这种考虑不平衡的损失函数在各种数据集和任务中均优于传统损失函数，特别是在...",
