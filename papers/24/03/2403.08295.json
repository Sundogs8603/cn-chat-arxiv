Gemma models demonstrate strong performance across academic benchmarks for language understanding, reasoning, and safety. We release two sizes of models (2 billion and 7 billion parameters), and provide both pretrained and fine-tuned checkpoints. Gemma outperforms similarly sized open models on 11 out of 18 text-based tasks, and we present comprehensive evaluations of safety and responsibility aspects of the models, alongside a detailed description of model development. We believe the responsible release of LLMs is critical for improving the safety of frontier models, and for enabling the next wave of LLM innovations.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了Gemma，这是一个基于Gemini模型研究和技术构建的轻量级、最先进的开放模型系列。Gemma模型在语言理解、推理和安全性等学术基准上表现出色。我们发布了两个规模的模型（20亿和70亿参数），并提供了预训练和微调的检查点。Gemma在18个基于文本的任务中，有11个任务优于类似规模的开放模型，并对模型的安全性和责任方面进行了全面评估，同时详细描述了模型开发过程。我们相信负责任地发布大型语言模型对于提高前沿模型的安全性，并实现下一波大型语言模型创新至关重要。",
