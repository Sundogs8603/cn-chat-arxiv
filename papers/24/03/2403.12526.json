    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.12526v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Events are essential components of speech and texts, describing the changes in the state of entities. The event extraction task aims to identify and classify events and find their participants according to event schemas. Manually predefined event schemas have limited coverage and are hard to migrate across domains. Therefore, the researchers propose Liberal Event Extraction (LEE), which aims to extract events and discover event schemas simultaneously. However, existing LEE models rely heavily on external language knowledge bases and require the manual development of numerous rules for noise removal and knowledge alignment, which is complex and laborious. To this end, we propose a Prompt-based Graph Model for Liberal Event Extraction (PGLEE). Specifically, we use a prompt-based model to obtain candidate triggers and arguments, and then build heterogeneous event graphs to encode the structures within and between events.

    "translated_abstract": "事件是语音和文本的必要组成部分，描述了实体状态的变化。事件提取任务旨在识别和分类事件，并根据事件模式找到参与者。手动预定义的事件模式覆盖范围有限，难以跨领域迁移。因此，研究人员提出自由事件提取（LEE），旨在同时提取事件并发现事件模式。然而，现有的LEE模型严重依赖外部语言知识库，并需要手动开发大量规则进行噪声去除和知识对齐，这是复杂和繁重的。为此，我们提出了一种基于提示的图模型用于自由事件提取（PGLEE）。具体来说，我们使用基于提示的模型来获取候选触发器和参数，然后构建异构事件图以编码事件内部和事件之间的结构。",
