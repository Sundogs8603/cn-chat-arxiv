Stance detection allows the automatic extraction of users' opinions on various topics from such content.

We present Stance Reasoner, an approach to zero-shot stance detection on social media that leverages explicit reasoning over background knowledge to guide the model's inference about the document's stance on a target.

    "translated_abstract": "社交媒体平台是丰富的观点内容来源。立场检测允许自动从这些内容中提取用户对各种话题的意见。我们关注零-shot立场检测，即模型的成功依赖于（a）对目标话题的知识；以及（b）学习可以用于新话题的通用推理策略。我们提出了Stance Reasoner，一种利用背景知识上的显式推理来引导模型推断有关文档在目标上的立场的零-shot立场检测方法。具体而言，我们的方法使用预训练语言模型作为世界知识的来源，采用上下文学习方法生成中间推理步骤。Stance Reasoner在3个Twitter数据集上表现优异，包括完全监督的模型。它可以更好地横跨目标进行泛化。",
