Recent advances in deep learning have led to multiple artificial neural network models matching or even surpassing human performance. However, while humans can identify and express the rule underlying these tasks with little to no exposure, contemporary neural networks often rely on massive pattern-based training and cannot express or extrapolate the rule inferred from the task.

    "translated_abstract": "人类智慧的一个特点是能够从有限的经验中推断出抽象规则，并将这些规则应用于陌生情境。最近深度学习方面取得的多项进展带来了多个人工神经网络模型能够达到甚至超越人类表现。然而，尽管人类能够在很少或没有接触的情况下识别和表达这些任务背后的规则，当代神经网络往往依赖于大规模基于模式的训练，无法表达或推断出任务中的规则。此外，用于神经网络训练的大部分Raven's Progressive Matrices或类似任务使用了符号表示，而人类可以在符号和连续感知表示之间灵活切换。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于特征检测的算法方法来检测和应用规则。",
