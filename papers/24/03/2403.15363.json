    "translated_abstract": "电网条件的高变异性，由于可再生能源渗透增加和极端天气事件的增加，使得筛选可能导致灾难性级联故障的情景变得更加困难。传统用于评估级联停电风险的基于电力流的工具速度太慢，无法适当探索可能的故障和负载/发电模式空间。我们在增长的基于图神经网络（GNN）的技术文献中做出了贡献，开发了两种新技术，用于从初始电网条件估计停电严重程度。首先，我们提出了几种方法，用于在严重程度估计之前通过初始分类步骤过滤出安全的“非停电”情景。其次，利用级联停电的统计属性，我们提出了一种方法，用于在我们的GNN模型中促进非局部消息传递。我们对这两种方法进行了验证。",
