    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.15048v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Large-scale Text-to-Image (TTI) models have become a common approach for generating training data in various generative fields. However, visual hallucinations, which contain perceptually critical defects, remain a concern, especially in non-photorealistic styles like cartoon characters. We propose a novel visual hallucination detection system for cartoon character images generated by TTI models. Our approach leverages pose-aware in-context visual learning (PA-ICVL) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs), utilizing both RGB images and pose information. By incorporating pose guidance from a fine-tuned pose estimator, we enable VLMs to make more accurate decisions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in identifying visual hallucinations compared to baseline methods relying solely on RGB images. This research advances TTI models by mitigating visual hallucinations, expanding their potential in non-photorealistic domains.",

    "translated_abstract": "大规模文本到图像（TTI）模型已经成为各种生成领域中生成训练数据的常见方法。然而，视觉幻觉，尤其是在非照片真实风格如卡通人物中包含了感知上关键的缺陷，依然是一个令人担忧的问题。我们提出了一种新颖的用于检测TTI模型生成的卡通角色图像的视觉幻觉检测系统。我们的方法利用了姿势感知上下文视觉学习（PA-ICVL）与视觉语言模型（VLMs），同时利用RGB图像和姿势信息。通过从一个经过微调的姿势估计器中获得姿势指导，我们使VLM能够做出更准确的决策。实验结果表明，在识别视觉幻觉方面，与仅依赖于RGB图像的基线方法相比，取得了显著的改进。这项研究通过减轻视觉幻觉，推动了TTI模型在非照片真实领域的潜力。",
