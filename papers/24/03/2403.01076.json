    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.01076v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: OOD detection has become more pertinent with advances in network design and increased task complexity. Identifying which parts of the data a given network is misclassifying has become as valuable as the network's overall performance. We can compress the model with quantization, but it suffers minor performance loss. The loss of performance further necessitates the need to derive the confidence estimate of the network's predictions. In line with this thinking, we introduce an Uncertainty Quantification(UQ) technique to quantify the uncertainty in the predictions from a pre-trained vision model. We subsequently leverage this information to extract valuable predictions while ignoring the non-confident predictions. We observe that our technique saves up to 80% of ignored samples from being misclassified. The code for the same is available here.",

    "translated_abstract": "OOD检测随着网络设计的进步和任务复杂性的增加变得更加重要。确定给定网络误分类数据的部分变得与网络整体性能一样有价值。我们可以通过量化来压缩模型，但会有轻微性能损失。性能损失进一步需要从网络预测中推导出置信度估计。为此，我们引入了一种不确定性量化（UQ）技术，用于量化来自预先训练视觉模型的预测的不确定性。随后，我们利用这些信息提取有价值的预测，同时忽略不确定的预测。我们观察到，我们的技术可以将被误分类的样本的80%保存下来。同样的代码可在此处找到。",
