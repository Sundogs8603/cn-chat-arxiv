    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）越来越多地应用于各种决策任务中，通常作为一个推荐系统，提供AI认为正确的建议。然而，最近的研究表明，这可能会削弱人类分析思维，并导致人类不恰当地依赖AI，损害人工智能团队的协同效应。相比之下，在群体决策中的人类顾问扮演各种角色，例如分析替代选项或批评决策者以鼓励他们的批判性思维。这种角色的多样性尚未在AI辅助中得到实证探究。在本文中，我们研究三种AI角色：推荐系统、分析者和魔鬼的辩护者，并评估它们在两种AI性能水平下的影响。我们的结果显示每种角色在任务表现、依赖适当性和用户体验方面具有独特的优势和局限性。值得注意的是，推荐系统角色并非始终最有效，特别是在...",
