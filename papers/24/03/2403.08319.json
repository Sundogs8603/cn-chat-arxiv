Our focus is on three categories of knowledge conflicts: context-memory, inter-context, and intra-memory conflict. These conflicts can significantly impact the trustworthiness and performance of LLMs, especially in real-world applications where noise and misinformation are common. By categorizing these conflicts, exploring the causes, examining the behaviors of LLMs under such conflicts, and reviewing available solutions, this survey aims to shed light on strategies for improving the robustness of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area.",

    "translated_abstract": "这项调查对大型语言模型（LLMs）的知识冲突进行了深入分析，突出了当它们融合上下文和参数化知识时所遇到的复杂挑战。我们关注三类知识冲突：上下文-记忆冲突、跨上下文冲突和内部记忆冲突。这些冲突可能会显著影响LLMs的可信度和性能，特别是在现实世界应用中，噪音和错误信息很常见。通过对这些冲突进行分类，探讨其原因，研究LLMs在这些冲突下的行为，并回顾可用的解决方案，本调查旨在为改进LLMs的稳健性策略提供启示，从而成为推动这一不断发展领域研究的宝贵资源。",
