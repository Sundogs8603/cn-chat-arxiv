However, the challenge of collecting human annotation results in a lack of reliable references in numerous application scenarios. Despite recent advancements in reference-free metrics, it has not been well understood when and where they can be used as an alternative to reference-based metrics. In this study, by employing diverse analytical approaches, we comprehensively assess the performance of both metrics across a wide range of NLG tasks, encompassing eight datasets and eight evaluation models. Based on solid experiments, the results show that reference-free metrics exhibit a higher correlation with human judgment and greater sensitivity to deficiencies in language quality.

    "translated_abstract": "大多数评估自然语言生成系统的自动指标都是基于参考的。然而，在许多应用场景中，由于收集人类注释结果的挑战，缺乏可靠的参考。尽管最近在无参考指标方面有了进展，但何时何地可以将其作为参考指标的替代品还不是很清楚。通过采用多种分析方法，本研究全面评估了两种指标在广泛的自然语言生成任务中的表现，涵盖了八个数据集和八个评估模型。基于扎实的实验，结果显示无参考指标与人类判断之间存在更高的相关性，并对语言质量的不足更为敏感。然而，它们的有效性在不同任务之间变化，并受到候选文本质量的影响。因此，重要的是在使用无参考指标之前评估其性能。",
