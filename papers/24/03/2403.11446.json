Our study introduces \"Guided Evolution\" (GE), a novel framework that diverges from these methods by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly modify code. GE leverages LLMs for a more intelligent, supervised evolutionary process, guiding mutations and crossovers. Our unique \"Evolution of Thought\" (EoT) technique further enhances GE by enabling LLMs to reflect on and learn from the outcomes of previous mutations.

GE maintains genetic diversity, crucial for evolutionary algorithms, by leveraging LLMs' capability to generate diverse responses from expertly crafted prompts and modulate model temperature.

    "translated_abstract": "在机器学习领域，传统的模型发展和自动化方法（如AutoML）通常依赖于层层抽象，如基于树或Cartesian遗传规划。我们的研究介绍了一种新颖的框架“引导进化”（GE），它不同于这些方法，利用大型语言模型（LLMs）直接修改代码。GE利用LLMs进行更智能的、有监督的进化过程，引导变异和交叉。我们独特的“思想进化”（EoT）技术进一步增强了GE，使LLMs能够反思和从先前变异的结果中学习。这导致了一个自我维持的反馈循环，增强了模型进化中的决策制定。通过利用LLMs生成对精心制作的提示的多样响应和调节模型温度来维持遗传多样性，GE维持着对进化算法至关重要的遗传多样性。这不仅加速了进化",
