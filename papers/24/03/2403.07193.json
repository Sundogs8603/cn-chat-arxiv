    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.07193v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: In this article, we present CuentosIE (TalesEI: chatbot of tales with a message to develop Emotional Intelligence), an educational chatbot on emotions that also provides teachers and psychologists with a tool to monitor their students/patients through indicators and data compiled by CuentosIE. The use of \"tales with a message\" is justified by their simplicity and easy understanding, thanks to their moral or associated metaphors. The main contributions of CuentosIE are the selection, collection, and classification of a set of highly specialized tales, as well as the provision of tools (searching, reading comprehension, chatting, recommending, and classifying) that are useful for both educating users about emotions and monitoring their emotional development. The preliminary evaluation of the tool has obtained encouraging results, which provides an affirmative answer to the question posed in the title of the article.",

    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们介绍了CuentosIE（TalesEI：一个关于情商发展的寓言寓意聊天机器人），这是一个关于情感的教育性聊天机器人，同时也为教师和心理学家提供了一个工具，通过CuentosIE编制的指标和数据来监测他们的学生/患者。选择“寓言寓意”的理由在于它们的简单性和易于理解，这归功于它们的道德或相关的隐喻。 CuentosIE的主要贡献在于选择、收集和分类一组高度专业化的故事，以及提供工具（搜索、阅读理解、聊天、推荐和分类）对教育用户情感并监测他们的情感发展都很有用。该工具的初步评估取得了令人鼓舞的结果，这肯定了文章标题中提出的问题。",
