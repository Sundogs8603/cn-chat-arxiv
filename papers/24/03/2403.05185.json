While promising, this move presents significant challenges for personalized recommendations. Unlike music and podcasts, audiobooks, initially available for a fee, cannot be easily skimmed before purchase, posing higher stakes for the relevance of recommendations. Furthermore, introducing a new content type into an existing platform confronts extreme data sparsity, as most users are unfamiliar with this new content type. Lastly, recommending content to millions of users requires the model to react fast and be scalable. To address these challenges, we leverage podcast and music user preferences and introduce 2T-HGNN, a scalable recommendation system comprising Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) and a Two Tower (2T) model. This novel approach uncovers nuanced item relationship",

    "translated_abstract": "在不断发展的数字音频领域中，以其音乐和谈话内容而闻名的Spotify最近向其庞大用户群引入了有声读物。尽管前景看好，但这一举措为个性化推荐带来了重大挑战。与音乐和播客不同，最初需要付费的有声读物在购买前无法轻松略读，这增加了推荐的相关性的挑战。此外，将新内容类型引入现有平台导致数据极度稀疏，因为大多数用户对这种新内容类型不熟悉。最后，向数百万用户推荐内容要求模型反应迅速且可扩展性强。为了解决这些挑战，我们利用播客和音乐用户喜好，引入了2T-HGNN，这是一个由异质图神经网络（HGNNs）和双塔（2T）模型组成的可扩展推荐系统。这一新颖方法揭示了项目之间微妙的关系。",
    "tldr": "通过引入双塔模型和异质图神经网络，该研究提出了一个可扩展的推荐系统，以应对Spotify在引入有声读物后面临的个性化推荐挑战。",
