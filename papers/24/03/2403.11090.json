    "translated_abstract": "新兴的可编程网络引发了对智能网络数据平面（INDP）的重要研究，实现了基于学习的线速流量分析。先前的INDP重点研究在数据平面上部署树/森林模型。我们观察到基于树的INDP方法存在根本局限性：虽然在数据平面上可以表示更大的树/森林表，但数据平面上可计算的流特征受硬件限制。本文介绍了BoS，通过实现神经网络（NN）驱动的线速流量分析来推动INDP的边界。许多类型的NN（如循环神经网络（RNN）和transformers）专为处理序列数据而设计，相对于基于树的模型具有优势，因为它们可以将原始网络数据作为输入，而无需即时进行复杂的特征计算。",
