In this paper, we explore a method for multiple clients to collaboratively learn an anomalous sound detection model while keeping their raw data private from each other. In the context of industrial machine anomalous sound detection, each client possesses data from different machines or different operational states, making it challenging to learn through federated learning or split learning. In our proposed method, each client calculates embeddings using a common pre-trained model developed for sound data classification, and these calculated embeddings are aggregated on the server to perform anomalous sound detection through outlier exposure. Experiments showed that our proposed method improves the AUC of anomalous sound detection by an average of 6.8%.",

    "translated_abstract": "为了开发一种机器声音监测系统，提出了一种检测异常声音的方法。本文探讨了一种多个客户端合作学习异常声音检测模型的方法，同时保持彼此的原始数据私密。在工业机器异常声音检测的背景下，每个客户端拥有来自不同机器或不同运行状态的数据，这使得通过联邦学习或分布式学习学习变得具有挑战性。在我们提出的方法中，每个客户端使用为声音数据分类而开发的通用预训练模型计算嵌入，然后在服务器上对这些计算得到的嵌入进行聚合，通过异常暴露来执行异常声音检测。实验表明，我们提出的方法将异常声音检测的AUC平均提高了6.8%。",
