We want to find the optimal aggregator minimizing regret under the worst information structure. The regret is defined by the difference in expected loss between the aggregator and a benchmark who makes the optimal decision given the joint distribution and reports of truthful experts.

    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑了在既有真实专家又有对抗性专家的情况下的二元决策聚合问题。真实专家将会如实报告他们的私人信号，并获得适当的激励，而对抗性专家可以任意报告。决策者需要设计一个鲁棒的聚合器，根据专家的报告来预测世界的真实状态。决策者不了解具体的信息结构，即信号、状态以及对抗性专家的策略的联合分布。我们希望找到在最坏信息结构下最小化遗憾的最优聚合器。遗憾被定义为聚合器和一个基准之间的期望损失差，该基准根据联合分布和真实专家的报告做出最优决策。我们证明了当真实专家是对称的且对抗性专家不太多时，截尾均值是最优的。",
