    "translated_abstract": "本文讨论了用于基于自然语言处理的社交媒体文本进行抑郁水平估计的精神健康数据集中注释的质量。尽管先前的研究依赖于用二进制类别注释的社交媒体数据集，即抑郁或非抑郁，但最近的数据集（如D2S和PRIMATE）旨在使用PHQ-9症状进行更细致的注释。然而，大多数这些数据集依赖于没有领域知识的众包工作者进行注释。针对PRIMATE数据集，我们的研究揭示了针对注释有效性的担忧，特别是缺乏兴趣或愉悦症状。通过精神健康专业人士的重新注释，我们引入了更精细的标签和文本范围作为证据，识别出相当数量的误报。我们的精细注释将在数据使用协议下发布，为无欲望症状检测提供了更高质量的测试集。本研究凸显了解决这一问题的必要性。",
