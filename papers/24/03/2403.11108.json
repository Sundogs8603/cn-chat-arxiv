    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.11108v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the development of an annotation schema to build datasets for evaluating the offline harm potential of social media texts. We define \"harm potential\" as the potential for an online public post to cause real-world physical harm (i.e., violence). Understanding that real-world violence is often spurred by a web of triggers, often combining several online tactics and pre-existing intersectional fissures in the social milieu, to result in targeted physical violence, we do not focus on any single divisive aspect (i.e., caste, gender, religion, or other identities of the victim and perpetrators) nor do we focus on just hate speech or mis/dis-information. Rather, our understanding of the intersectional causes of such triggers focuses our attempt at measuring the harm potential of online content, irrespective of whether it is hateful or not. In this paper, we discuss the development of a framework/annotation schema that ",

    "translated_abstract": "在这篇论文中，我们讨论了开发一个注释模式来构建数据集，以评估社交媒体文本的离线危害潜力。我们将“危害潜力”定义为在线公开帖子引发真实世界身体伤害（即暴力）的潜力。我们意识到真实世界的暴力通常是由一系列触发因素共同引发的，这些因素结合了几种在线战术和社会环境中现有的交叉分歧，从而导致有针对性的身体暴力。因此，我们不专注于任何单一的分裂性方面（如种姓、性别、宗教或受害者和施害者的其他身份），也不仅专注于仇恨言论或错误/偏斜信息。相反，我们对此类触发因素的交叉原因的理解聚焦于尝试衡量在线内容的危害潜力，无论其是否充满仇恨。在本文中，我们讨论了一个用于构建用于评估社交媒体文本离线危害潜力的数据集的注释框架/注释模式的发展。",
