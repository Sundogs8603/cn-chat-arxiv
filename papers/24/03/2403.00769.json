    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.00769v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: The explosive growth of online education environments is generating a massive volume of data, specially in text format from forums, chats, social networks, assessments, essays, among others. It produces exciting challenges on how to mine text data in order to find useful knowledge for educational stakeholders. Despite the increasing number of educational applications of text mining published recently, we have not found any paper surveying them. In this line, this work presents a systematic overview of the current status of the Educational Text Mining field. Our final goal is to answer three main research questions: Which are the text mining techniques most used in educational environments? Which are the most used educational resources? And which are the main applications or educational goals? Finally, we outline the conclusions and the more interesting future trends.",

    "translated_title": "在教育领域的文本挖掘",
    "translated_abstract": "在线教育环境的迅猛增长产生了大量数据，特别是来自论坛、聊天、社交网络、评估、论文等文本格式的数据。如何挖掘文本数据以找到对教育相关人员有用的知识，是一个激动人心的挑战。尽管最近已发表了越来越多应用文本挖掘于教育领域的文章，但我们尚未找到任何综述这些工作的论文。因此，本文对当前教育文本挖掘领域的现状进行了系统概述。我们的最终目标是回答三个主要研究问题：在教育环境中最常用的文本挖掘技术是什么？最常用的教育资源是什么？主要应用或教育目标是什么？最后，我们总结了结论和更有趣的未来趋势。",
