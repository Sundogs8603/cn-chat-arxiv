    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.17564v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Since paraphrasing is an ill-defined task, the term \"paraphrasing\" covers text transformation tasks with different characteristics. Consequently, existing paraphrasing studies have applied quite different (explicit and implicit) criteria as to when a pair of texts is to be considered a paraphrase, all of which amount to postulating a certain level of semantic or lexical similarity. In this paper, we conduct a literature review and propose a taxonomy to organize the 25~identified paraphrasing (sub-)tasks. Using classifiers trained to identify the tasks that a given paraphrasing instance fits, we find that the distributions of task-specific instances in the known paraphrase corpora vary substantially. This means that the use of these corpora, without the respective paraphrase conditions being clearly defined (which is the normal case), must lead to incomparable and misleading results.",

    "translated_abstract": "由于释义是一个定义模糊的任务，术语“释义”涵盖了具有不同特征的文本转换任务。因此，现有的释义研究在何时将一对文本视为释义方面应用了相当不同的（显式和隐式）标准，所有这些标准都要求假设某种级别的语义或词汇相似性。在本文中，我们进行了文献综述，并提出了一个分类法来组织已识别出的25个释义（子）任务。通过训练用于识别给定释义实例适用的任务的分类器，我们发现已知释义语料库中特定任务实例的分布差异很大。这意味着在未清楚定义相应释义条件的情况下使用这些语料库（这是正常情况）会导致无法比较和误导性的结果。",
