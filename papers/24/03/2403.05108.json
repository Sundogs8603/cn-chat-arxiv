Therefore, designing task-driven multi-UAV coalition formation mechanism has become a challenging problem.

To address these problems, this paper proposed a novel multi-UAV coalition network collaborative task completion model, considering both coalition work capacity and task-requirement relationships. This model stimulated the formation of coalitions that match task requirements by using a revenue function based on the coalition's revenue threshold.

    "translated_abstract": "随着无人机技术的快速发展，无人机联盟形成问题已成为一个热点。因此，设计任务驱动的多无人机联盟形成机制已经成为一个具有挑战性的问题。然而，现有的联盟形成机制存在着无人机与任务要求之间的关联性低，导致整体联盟效用低且联盟结构不稳定。为解决这些问题，本文提出了一种新颖的多无人机联盟网络协作任务完成模型，考虑了联盟工作能力和任务需求关系。该模型通过基于联盟收入阈值的收入函数来刺激与任务要求匹配的联盟形成。随后，提出了一种基于边际效用的联盟形成算法。具体来说，该算法利用Shapley值实现了联盟内公平效用分配。",
