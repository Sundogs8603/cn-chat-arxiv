    "translated_abstract": "机器学习领域自大型语言模型（LLMs）首次出现以来取得了令人瞩目的进展，然而它们巨大的内存消耗已成为大规模训练的主要障碍。虽然已经提出了诸如低秩调整（LoRA）之类的参数高效微调技术来缓解这一问题，但在大多数大规模微调设置中，它们的性能仍无法与完整参数训练相匹配。为弥补这一不足，我们研究了LoRA在微调任务中的逐层特性，并观察到不同层之间权重范数的异常偏斜。利用这一关键观察，我们发现了一个令人惊讶简单的训练策略，在记忆成本低于LoRA的情况下，在广泛的设置中优于LoRA和完整参数训练。我们将其命名为Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW（LISA），这是LoRA的一个有希望的替代方案，应用了",
