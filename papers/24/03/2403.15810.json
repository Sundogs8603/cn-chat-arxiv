    "translated_abstract": "国家足球队越来越多地发行可交易的基于区块链的球迷代币，以战略性地增强球迷参与度。本研究调查了2022年世界杯比赛对每支球队球迷代币动态表现的影响。事件研究揭示了在世界杯前六个月，球迷代币回报率飙升，受到正向预期效应的推动。然而，盘内分析揭示了球迷代币回报率的反转，随着比赛的进行而持续下降，交易量上涨。为了解释这些发现，我们揭示了高赌注比赛中的失败导致球迷代币回报率骤降，相比低赌注比赛，淘汰赛比赛的幅度加剧。相反，胜利增加了交易量，反映了市场活动的增加，但没有相应的回报。我们将发现与经典市场格言“买谣言，卖消息”相一致，揭示了认知偏差和细微差别。",
