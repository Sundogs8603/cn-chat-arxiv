Previous work developed a photonic PUF offering improved security compared to non-optical counterparts. Here, we investigate this PUF's susceptibility to Multiple-Valued-Logic-based machine learning attacks.

    "translated_abstract": "物理不可克隆函数（PUFs）使用非线性相关的挑战-响应对（CRPs）来识别集成电路。理想情况下，挑战和相应响应之间的关系是不可预测的，即使已知某些CRPs的子集。先前的工作开发了一种光子PUF，相比非光学对应物提供了更好的安全性。在这里，我们调查了这种PUF对基于多值逻辑的机器学习攻击的敏感性。我们发现大约需要1,000个CRPs来训练模型，才能比随机猜测更好地预测响应位。考虑到从光子PUF获取大量CRPs的巨大挑战，我们的结果表明光子PUF对此类攻击具有韧性。",
