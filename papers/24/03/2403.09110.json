    "translated_abstract": "深度强化学习（DRL）已显示出在与复杂动态环境中相互作用的复杂控制策略中具有显著潜力，例如稳定托卡马克聚变反应堆的磁流体动力学或使物体在流体流动中受到的阻力最小化。然而，这些算法需要大量的训练样本，对许多应用而言成本可能过高。另外，依赖深度神经网络往往会导致难以解释的黑盒策略，可能在某些嵌入式系统中使用时计算成本过高。最近的稀疏字典学习方法的进展，如稀疏非线性动力学的稀疏识别（SINDy），显示出在低数据制度下创建高效且可解释的数据驱动模型的前景。在这项工作中，我们介绍SINDy-RL，这是一个结合SINDy和DRL的统一框架，用于创建高效的可解释的模型。",
