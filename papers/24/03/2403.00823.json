The game is unique due to the way that language and coordination between teammates play important roles. Previous approaches to designing agents for this game have utilized a single internal language model to determine action choices. This often leads to good performance with some teammates and inferior performance with other teammates, as the agent cannot adapt to any specific teammate. In this paper we present the first adaptive agent for playing Codenames. We adopt an ensemble approach with the goal of determining, during the course of interacting with a specific teammate, which of our internal expert agents, each potentially with its own language model, is the best match. One difficulty faced in this approach is the lack of a single numerical metric that accurately captures the performance of a Codenames team. Prior Codenames research has",
