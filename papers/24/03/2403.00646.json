Our main objective is to develop a method that facilitates the inference of quadratic control dynamical systems with inherent stability guarantees. To this aim, we investigate the stability characteristics of control systems with energy-preserving nonlinearities, thereby identifying conditions under which such systems are bounded-input bounded-state stable.

    "translated_abstract": "本文主要关注一种运算推断方法，旨在基于关于结构的先验假设构建低维动力模型，这些假设通常受到已建立的物理学或专家见解的启发。稳定性是动力系统的基本属性，然而，并非总是可以在通过推断得出的模型中保证稳定性。我们的主要目标是开发一种方法，以便推断具有固有稳定性保证的二次控制动态系统。为此，我们研究了具有能量保持非线性的控制系统的稳定性特征，从而确定这类系统在哪些条件下是有界输入有界状态稳定的。这些见解随后应用于学习过程，产生了从设计上固有稳定的推断模型。我们提出的框架的有效性通过一些数值例子加以证明。",
