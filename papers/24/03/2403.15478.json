Our approach comprises three steps. Initially, we construct a BERT-based model for estimating sentence-level suicide risk and negative sentiment. Next, we precisely identify high suicide risk sentences by emphasizing elevated probabilities of both suicide risk and negative sentiment. Finally, we integrate generative summaries using the MentaLLaMa framework and extractive summaries from identified high suicide risk sentences and a specialized dictionary of suicidal risk words. SophiaADS, our team, achieved 1st place for highlight extraction and ranked 10th for summary generation, both based on recall and consistency metrics, respectively.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了一种方法，该方法集成了监督式提取和生成式语言模型，用于在CLPsych 2024共享任务中提供自杀风险的支持证据。我们的方法包括三个步骤。首先，我们构建了一个基于BERT的模型，用于估计句子级别的自杀风险和负面情绪。接下来，我们通过强调自杀风险和负面情绪的概率提高，精确定位高自杀风险句子。最后，我们使用MentaLLaMa框架整合生成式摘要和从确定的高自杀风险句子和一个专门的自杀风险词典中提取摘要。我们的团队SophiaADS在突出摘要中取得了第一名，在摘要生成中根据召回率和一致性指标分别排名第十。",
