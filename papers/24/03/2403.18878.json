Current attempts to incorporate anatomical features include broadening effective receptive fields (ERF) size with resource- and data-intensive modules such as self-attention or introducing organ-specific topology regularizers, which may not scale to multi-organ segmentation problems where inter-organ relation also plays a huge role. We introduce a new approach to impose anatomical constraints on any existing encoder-decoder segmentation model by conditioning model prediction with learnable anatomy prior. More specifically, given an abdominal scan, a part of the encoder spatially warps a learnable prior to align with the given input scan using thin plate spline (TPS) grid interpolation.
