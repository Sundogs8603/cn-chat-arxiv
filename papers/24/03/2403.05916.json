This paper assesses the application of MLMs with 5 crucial abilities for affective computing, spanning from visual affective tasks and reasoning tasks. The results show that GPT4 has high accuracy in facial action unit recognition and micro-expression detection while its general facial expression recognition performance is not accurate.

    "translated_abstract": "多模态语言模型（MLMs）旨在处理和整合来自多个来源的信息，例如文本、语音、图像和视频。尽管在语言理解方面取得了成功，但对下游任务的性能进行评估对于更好的以人为中心的应用至关重要。本文评估了MLMs在情感计算中的应用，跨越视觉情感任务和推理任务的5个关键能力。结果显示，GPT4在面部动作单位识别和微表情检测方面具有高准确性，而其一般面部表情识别性能不准确。我们还强调了实现细粒度微表情识别的挑战，以及进一步研究的潜力，并通过与任务相关代理结合展示了GPT4处理情感识别和相关领域高级任务的多功能性和潜力，以处理更复杂的任务。",
