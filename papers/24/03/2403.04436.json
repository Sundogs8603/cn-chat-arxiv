To create a large-scale retargeted motion dataset of human movements for humanoid robots, we propose a scalable \"sim-to-data\" process to filter and pick feasible motions using a privileged motion imitator. Afterwards, we train a robust real-time humanoid motion imitator in simulation using these refined motions and transfer it to the real humanoid robot in a zero-shot manner. We successfully achieve teleoperation of dynamic whole-body motions in real-world scenarios, including walking, back jumping, kicking, turning, waving, pushing, boxing, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration to achieve learning-based real-time whole-body humanoid teleoperation.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了\"Human to Humanoid (H2O)\"这一基于强化学习（RL）的框架，可以利用仅有的一个RGB相机实现对全尺寸人形机器人的实时全身遥操作。为了为人形机器人创建一个大规模的人类运动重定向数据集，我们提出了一种可扩展的“从模拟到数据”的流程，使用一个特权运动模仿器来筛选和选择可行的动作。随后，我们在模拟环境中使用这些精细的动作训练一个稳健的实时人形机器人动作模仿器，并以零次试验的方式将其迁移到真实人形机器人上。我们成功实现了在真实环境中对动态全身运动的遥操作，包括行走、后跳、踢球、转身、挥手、推动、拳击等。据我们所知，这是实现基于学习的实时全身人形机器人遥控的首次演示。",
