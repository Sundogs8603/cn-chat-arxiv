Recognizing this gap, recent calls for research emphasize the need for qualitative data analysis to delve into FDI determinants, particularly at the regional level. This paper proposes a novel methodology, based on text mining and social network analysis, to get information from more than 167,000 online news articles to quantify regional-level (sub-national) attributes affecting FDI ownership in African companies.

    "translated_title": "一种理解非洲外资直接投资次国家决定因素的大数据方法",
    "translated_abstract": "各种宏观经济和制度因素阻碍了外资直接投资流入，包括腐败、贸易开放性、融资途径和政治不稳定性。现有研究主要集中在国家层面数据，对企业层面数据的探索有限，尤其在发展中国家。鉴于这一空白，最近对研究的呼吁强调了对定性数据分析的需求，特别是在区域层面深入探讨外资直接投资决定因素。本文提出了一种新颖的方法，基于文本挖掘和社交网络分析，从超过167,000篇在线新闻文章获取信息，以量化影响非洲公司外资直接投资所有权的区域级（次国家级）属性。我们的分析扩展了世界银行企业调查所绘制的工业发展障碍信息。研究结果表明，区域级（次国家级）的结构和制度特征在决定外资直接投资方面可以发挥重要作用。",
