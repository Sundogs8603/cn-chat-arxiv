    "translated_abstract": "机器学习(ML)算法的有效性与其训练数据集的质量和多样性密切相关。改进的数据集，标志着优越的质量，增强了预测的准确性，并扩展了模型在各种场景下的适用性。研究人员经常整合来自多个来源的数据，以减轻单一来源数据集的偏见和限制。然而，这种广泛的数据融合引发了重大的道德关切，特别是关于用户隐私和未经授权的数据披露风险。已建立了各种全球立法框架来解决这些隐私问题。虽然这些法规对保护隐私至关重要，但它们可能会使ML技术的实际部署变得复杂。隐私保护机器学习(PPML)通过保护从健康记录到地理位置数据等敏感信息，同时实现安全使用这些信息，来应对这一挑战。",
