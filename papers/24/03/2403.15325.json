Besides defining autonomous systems from a technological viewpoint and explaining how AI development is characterized, we show how already existing and openly available AI technology could be misused. To underline this, we developed three exemplary use cases of potentially misused AI that threaten political, digital and physical security. The use cases can be built from existing AI technologies and components from academia, the private sector and the developer-community. This shows how freely available AI can be combined into autonomous weapon systems.

    "translated_abstract": "潜在的对民用人工智能（AI）的恶意滥用对国家和国际安全构成严重威胁。本文从技术角度定义自主系统，解释AI发展的特点，并展示已经存在并公开可用的AI技术如何被滥用。为了强调这一点，我们开发了三个潜在被滥用的AI的示例用例，这些用例威胁到政治、数字和身体安全。这些用例可以基于现有的AI技术和学术界、私营部门和开发者社区的组件构建，展示了如何将免费可用的AI组合成自主武器系统。基于这些用例，我们推断控制点和进一步措施，以防止通过滥用AI造成的潜在威胁。此外，我们倡导在讨论自主武器系统时考虑对民用AI系统的恶意滥用。",
