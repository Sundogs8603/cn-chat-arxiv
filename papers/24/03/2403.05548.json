That is the case with online antisemitism, the specific category of hatred considered in this study. Tracking antisemitic themes and their associated terminology over time in online discussions could help monitor the sentiments of their participants and their evolution, and possibly offer avenues for intervention that may prevent the escalation of hatred. Due to the large volume and constant evolution of online traffic, monitoring conversations manually is impractical. Instead, we propose an automated method that extracts antisemitic themes and terminology from extremist social media over time and captures their evolution. Since supervised learning would be too limited for such a task, we created an unsupervised online machine learning approach that uses large language model",

    "translated_abstract": "研究表明，社交媒体上的种族主义和不宽容有可能在线下产生仇恨，最终导致身体暴力。本研究考虑的是在线反犹主义，追踪在线讨论中的反犹主题及其相关术语的演变，有助于监测参与者的情绪和演变，并可能提供干预方法，防止仇恨升级。鉴于在线流量庞大且不断变化，手动监测谈话实际上是不现实的。因此，我们提出了一种自动化方法，可以从极端社交媒体中提取反犹主题和术语，跟踪它们的演变。由于监督学习在这样的任务中过于受限，我们开发了一种无监督的在线机器学习方法，使用大型语言模型。",
