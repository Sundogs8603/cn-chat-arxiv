The value of the PPA to the buyer depends on the so called capture price defined as the difference between this fixed price and the market value of the produced volume during the duration of the contract. To model the capture price, practitioners often use either fundamental or statistical approaches to model future market prices, which both have their inherent limitations.

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.08846v1 发布类型: 新 公司可再生能源电力购买协议（PPAs）是长期合同，使公司能够购买可再生能源，而无需开发和运营自己的产能。通常，生产商和消费者就购买电力的固定单价达成协议。协议对买方的价值取决于所谓的捕捉价格，即固定价格与合同期间生产数量的市场价值之间的差异。为了模拟捕获价格，从业者通常使用基本或统计方法来模拟未来市场价格，这两者都具有固有局限性。我们提出了一种新的方法，将基本电力市场模型的逻辑与统计学习技术相结合。具体而言，我们在电力市场的二次基本自下而上模型中使用正则化逆优化来估计不同技术的边际成本。",
