    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.13574v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: In online video platforms, reading or writing comments on interesting videos has become an essential part of the video watching experience. However, existing video recommender systems mainly model users' interaction behaviors with videos, lacking consideration of comments in user behavior modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation approach called LSVCR by leveraging user interaction histories with both videos and comments, so as to jointly conduct personalized video and comment recommendation. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components, namely sequential recommendation (SR) model and supplemental large language model (LLM) recommender. The SR model serves as the primary recommendation backbone (retained in deployment) of our approach, allowing for efficient user preference modeling. Meanwhile, we leverage the LLM recommender as a supplemental component (discarded in deployment) to better capture underlying ",

    "translated_abstract": "在在线视频平台上，阅读或撰写有趣视频的评论已经成为视频观看体验中不可或缺的一部分。然而，现有视频推荐系统主要对用户与视频的交互行为进行建模，缺乏对评论在用户行为建模中的考虑。本文提出了一种名为LSVCR的新颖推荐方法，通过利用用户与视频和评论的交互历史，共同进行个性化视频和评论推荐。具体而言，我们的方法由两个关键组件组成，即序列推荐（SR）模型和补充大型语言模型（LLM）推荐器。SR模型作为我们方法的主要推荐骨干（在部署中保留），可实现高效的用户偏好建模。与此同时，我们利用LLM推荐器作为一个补充组件（在部署中丢弃），以更好地捕捉潜在",
