SOTA approaches for Fake News Detection (FND) count upon appropriately labelled and large datasets. FND in regional and resource-constrained languages lags due to the lack of limited-sized datasets and legitimate lexical resources.

    "translated_abstract": "误传信息可能严重影响社会，影响从公众舆论到机构信心和一个国家的政治前景等各个方面。在线网站和在线社交网络上的虚假新闻传播呈现大量增长。各种事实核查网站的新闻主要以英语发布，几乎不提供有关地区语言虚假新闻的信息。因此，无法通过事实核查门户网站来识别乌尔都语虚假新闻传播者。虚假新闻检测(SOTA)方法依赖于适当标记和大规模数据集。地区和资源受限语言的虚假新闻检测由于数据集规模有限和合法词汇资源的缺乏而滞后。先前用于乌尔都语虚假新闻检测的数据集规模有限、领域受限、不公开且未经人工验证，其中新闻是从英语翻译为乌尔都语。本文策划并贡献了首个最大规模的公开可用的乌尔都语数据集。",
    "tldr": "本文提出了乌尔都语虚假新闻检测的首个最大规模公开数据集，填补了地区语言虚假新闻检测领域数据集规模有限的空白。",
