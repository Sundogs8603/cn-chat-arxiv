Grounded in fuzzy-trace theory, which emphasizes the importance of gists of causal coherence in effective health communication, we introduce Role-Based Incremental Coaching (RBIC), a prompt-based LLM framework, to identify gists at-scale. Using RBIC, we systematically extract gists from subreddit discussions opposing COVID-19 health measures (Study 1).

    "translated_abstract": "我们引入了一个多步推理框架，使用基于提示的LLMs来研究社交媒体语言模式与国家健康结果趋势之间的关系。基于模糊轨迹理论，强调健康沟通中因果一致性要义的重要性，我们引入了基于角色的渐进辅导（RBIC），一个基于提示的LLM框架，以大规模识别要义。使用RBIC，我们系统地从反对COVID-19健康措施的subreddit讨论中提取要义（研究1）。然后我们跟踪这些要义在关键事件中的演变（研究2），并评估它们对在线互动的影响（研究3）。最后，我们研究要义量如何与国家健康趋势（如疫苗接种率和住院率）相关联（研究4）。我们的工作首次从实证角度将社交媒体语言模式与现实世界公共卫生趋势联系起来，突显了基于提示的潜力。",
