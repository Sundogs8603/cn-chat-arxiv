In this paper, we study the influence these biases can have in the pervasive problem of fake news by evaluating human participants' capacity to identify false headlines. By focusing on headlines involving sensitive characteristics, we gather a comprehensive dataset to explore how human responses are shaped by their biases. Our analysis reveals recurring individual biases and their permeation into collective decisions. We show that demographic factors, headline categories, and the manner in which information is presented significantly influence errors in human judgment.

    "translated_abstract": "个人和社会偏见削弱了人类顾问的效力，因为它导致判断错误，这可能对受保护的群体造成不利。本文研究了这些偏见在假新闻这一普遍问题中可能产生的影响，通过评估人类参与者识别虚假标题的能力。我们聚焦涉及敏感特征的标题，收集了一个全面的数据集，探讨人类反应如何受他们的偏见所影响。我们的分析揭示了不断出现的个人偏见及其渗透入集体决策中。我们展示了人口因素、标题类别以及信息呈现方式显著影响人类判断中的错误。然后，我们将收集的数据作为基准问题，评估自适应聚合算法的有效性。除了提高的准确性外，我们的结果突出了新算法崛起时的相互作用。",
