    "translated_abstract": "我们提出了PAGE，一种具有面向过去无关生成回放的领域增量适应策略，用于智能医疗。PAGE能够实现生成回放，而无需保留来自先前领域的任何数据或信息。在适应新领域时，它利用来自新分布和当前模型的真实数据来生成合成数据，以保留先前领域的学习知识。通过在训练过程中重新播放合成数据和新实际数据，PAGE在领域适应和知识保留之间取得良好平衡。此外，我们将扩展的归纳确认预测（EICP）方法整合到PAGE中，为每个检测结果生成置信度分数和可信度值。这使得预测结果具有可解释性，并为智能医疗应用中的疾病检测提供统计保证。我们展示了PAGE在领域增量疾病检测中的有效性。",
