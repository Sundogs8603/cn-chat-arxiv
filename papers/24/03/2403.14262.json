    "translated_abstract": "监督深度学习技术在医学图像分析中显示出潜力，然而，它们需要全面的带注释数据集，这对于罕见疾病尤其具有挑战性。因此，无监督异常检测(UAD)作为病理分割的一种可行替代方案出现，因为只需要健康数据进行训练。然而，最近的UAD异常评分函数通常只关注强度，忽略结构差异，这影响了分割性能。本研究探讨了结构相似度(SSIM)作为弥合这一差距的潜力。SSIM捕捉了强度和结构差异，且可能优于传统的$l1$误差。然而，我们表明对于不同病理学，SSIM计算存在多个最佳核大小。因此，我们研究了用于不同核大小的自适应集成策略，以提供更具病理学普适性的评分机制。",
