    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.01811v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Grading short answer questions automatically with interpretable reasoning behind the grading decision is a challenging goal for current transformer approaches. Justification cue detection, in combination with logical reasoners, has shown a promising direction for neuro-symbolic architectures in ASAG. But, one of the main challenges is the requirement of annotated justification cues in the students' responses, which only exist for a few ASAG datasets. To overcome this challenge, we contribute (1) a weakly supervised annotation procedure for justification cues in ASAG datasets, and (2) a neuro-symbolic model for explainable ASAG based on justification cues. Our approach improves upon the RMSE by 0.24 to 0.3 compared to the state-of-the-art on the Short Answer Feedback dataset in a bilingual, multi-domain, and multi-question training setup. This result shows that our approach provides a promising direction for generating high-quality grades",

    "translated_abstract": "使用具有解释性的推理来自动评分简答题，并使评分决定背后的推理可解释是当前变压器模型方法面临的挑战。在ASAG中，通过逻辑推理器探测合理化线索，已经展示出一种有前途的神经符号架构方向。然而，主要挑战之一是需要标注在学生回答中的合理化线索，这仅在少数ASAG数据集中存在。为了克服这一挑战，我们提出了（1）一种用于ASAG数据集中合理化线索的弱监督注释程序，以及（2）一种基于合理化线索的可解释ASAG的神经符号模型。与Short Answer Feedback数据集的最新技术相比，我们的方法在双语、多领域和多问题训练设置中将均方根误差提高了0.24到0.3。这一结果表明，我们的方法为生成高质量评分提供了一个有前途的方向。",
