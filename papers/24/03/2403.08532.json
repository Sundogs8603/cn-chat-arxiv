    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.08532v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study the welfare effects of overreaction to information in the form of diagnostic expectations in markets with asymmetric information, and the effect of a simple intervention in the form of a tax or a subsidy. A large enough level of overreaction is always welfare-decreasing and can rationalize a tax on financial transactions. A small degree of overreaction to private information can both increase or decrease welfare. This is because there are two competing externalities: an information externality, due to the informational role of prices, and a pecuniary externality, due to the allocative role of prices. When the information externality prevails on the pecuniary externality, the loading on private information in agents' trades is too small compared to the welfare optimum: in this case, a small degree of overreaction is welfare-improving.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了在存在不对称信息的市场中，以诊断性期望的形式对信息过度反应对福利的影响，以及一项简单干预（如税收或补贴）的效果。足够高水平的信息过度反应总是会减少福利，并且可以合理化对金融交易征税。对私人信息的轻微过度反应可能会增加或减少福利。这是因为存在着两种竞争性外部性：信息外部性，由于价格的信息传递作用，和货币外部性，由于价格的配置作用。当信息外部性占上风，超越了货币外部性时，代理人交易中对私人信息的负载相对于福利最优值太小：在这种情况下，轻微过度反应有助于提高福利。",
    "tldr": "信息过度反应在市场中可能带来负面影响，但在某些情况下能提升福利，这取决于信息外部性和货币外部性的竞争关系。",
