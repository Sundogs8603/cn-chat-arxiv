    "translated_abstract": "在图领域中，由于复杂的分布转移和缺乏环境背景，图的超出分布（OOD）泛化具有挑战性。最近的方法尝试通过生成平面环境来增强图的OOD泛化。然而，这种平面环境存在固有的局限性，无法捕捉更复杂的数据分布。因此，针对包含各种训练环境（如骨架、大小等）的DrugOOD数据集，平面环境无法充分解决其高异质性。因此，提出了一个新的挑战，即生成更具语义丰富的环境，以增强图的不变学习以处理分布转移。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，为每个图生成分层语义环境。首先，给定输入图，我们明确地提取输入图中的变体子图，以在本地环境上生成代理预测。然后，随机注意...",
