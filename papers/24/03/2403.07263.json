Thus, we develop a novel two-step conformal approach that propagates uncertainty in predicted class labels into the uncertainty intervals for the bounding boxes.

    "translated_abstract": "量化模型的预测不确定性对于像自动驾驶这样的安全关键应用至关重要。我们考虑为多物体检测量化这种不确定性。具体来说，我们利用形式预测来获得具有保证覆盖率的物体边界框不确定性区间。这样做的一个挑战是边界框的预测取决于物体的类别标签。因此，我们开发了一种新颖的两步形式方法，将对预测类别标签的不确定性传播到边界框的不确定性区间中。这样，我们的形式覆盖保证的有效性更广泛，包括了被错误分类的物体，确保它们在需要最大安全保证时的实用性。此外，我们研究了新颖的集成和分位数回归形式，以确保边界框区间能够适应物体大小，从而实现更平衡的覆盖率。",
