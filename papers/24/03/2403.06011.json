    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.06011v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We study paycheck optimization, which examines how to allocate income in order to achieve several competing financial goals. For paycheck optimization, a quantitative methodology is missing, due to a lack of a suitable problem formulation. To deal with this issue, we formulate the problem as a utility maximization problem. The proposed formulation is able to (i) unify different financial goals; (ii) incorporate user preferences regarding the goals; (iii) handle stochastic interest rates. The proposed formulation also facilitates an end-to-end reinforcement learning solution, which is implemented on a variety of problem settings.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了工资优化，探讨如何分配收入以实现多个竞争性金融目标。对于工资优化来说，由于缺乏合适的问题形式化，缺少定量方法。为了解决这个问题，我们将问题形式化为效用最大化问题。提出的形式化能够（i）统一不同的金融目标；（ii）整合用户关于目标的偏好；（iii）处理随机利率。所提出的形式化还有助于端到端的强化学习解决方案，在多种问题设置上进行了实现。",
