However, such investigation has not been conducted for detecting multiple mental disorders. The rationale behind the existence of a task-agnostic representation lies in the overlapping symptoms among multiple mental disorders. Consequently, the behavioural data collected for mental health assessment may carry a mixed bag of attributes related to multiple disorders. Motivated by that, in this study, we explore a task-agnostic representation derived through SSL in the context of detecting major depressive disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using audio and video data collected during interactive sessions. This study employs SSL models trained by predicting multiple fixed targets or masked frames. We propose a list of fixed targets to make the generated representation more efficient for detecting MDD ",

    "translated_abstract": "自监督学习（SSL）已经被研究用于在各个领域生成任务无关的表示。然而，到目前为止，尚未有人探索用于检测多种心理障碍的这种方法。存在任务无关表示的理由在于多种心理障碍之间的症状重叠。因此，收集用于心理健康评估的行为数据可能包含与多种障碍相关的属性。受此启发，本研究探讨了通过SSL推导出的任务无关表示，用于使用在互动会话期间收集的音频和视频数据检测重度抑郁障碍（MDD）和创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的情境。本研究采用了通过预测多个固定目标或掩膜帧训练的SSL模型。我们提出了一系列固定目标，以使生成的表示对MDD的检测更加高效。",
