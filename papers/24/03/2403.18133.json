Mining association rules from high-dimensional numerical data, for example, time series data from a large number of sensors in a smart environment, is a computationally intensive task. In this study, we propose an Autoencoder-based approach to learn and extract association rules from time series data (AE SemRL). Moreover, we argue that in the presence of semantic information related to time series data sources, semantics can facilitate learning generalizable and explainable association rules. Despite enriching time series data with additional semantic features, AE SemRL makes learning association rules from high-dimensional data feasible. Our experiments show that semantic association rules can be extracted from a latent representation created by an Autoencoder and this method has in the order of hundreds of times faster",

    "translated_abstract": "关联规则挖掘（ARM）是学习数据特征之间逻辑规则关联的任务。从高维数值数据中挖掘关联规则，例如从智能环境中大量传感器的时间序列数据，是一项计算密集型的任务。在本研究中，我们提出了一种基于自动编码器的方法，用于从时间序列数据中学习和提取关联规则（AE SemRL）。此外，我们认为，在与时间序列数据源相关的语义信息存在时，语义可以促进学习可推广和可解释的关联规则。尽管通过额外的语义特征丰富时间序列数据，AE SemRL使得从高维数据中学习关联规则变得可行。我们的实验表明，可以从自动编码器生成的潜在表示中提取语义关联规则，并且此方法速度快上百倍。",
