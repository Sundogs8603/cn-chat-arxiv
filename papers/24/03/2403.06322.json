For example, although excessive visitations during rest hours can potentially exacerbate the risk of circadian rhythm disruption and delirium, it is not captured in the ICU.

In the past few years, the computer vision field has found application in many domains by reducing the human burden.

    "translated_abstract": "尽管密切监测重症监护病房（ICU）患者的重要性，由于医护人员面临的时间限制，许多方面仍然受到限制评估。过度的探视可能在休息时间加剧循环节律紊乱和谵妄的风险，但在ICU中并未被捕捉。同样，活动能力可以是ICU患者康复或恶化的重要指标，但只被零星地捕捉或根本不被捕捉。在过去几年中，计算机视觉领域在许多领域中找到了应用，减轻了人力负担。在ICU中使用计算机视觉系统也有可能实现不存在的评估或增强现有评估的频率和准确性，同时减少工作人员的工作量。本研究利用基于深度成像的最新非侵入式计算机视觉系统，",
