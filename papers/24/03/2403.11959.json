    "translated_abstract": "视频动作计数（VAC）在分析运动、健身和日常活动中具有重要意义，通过量化视频中的重复动作。然而，传统的VAC方法忽略了动作重复的复杂性，如中断和周期持续时间的变异性。我们的研究通过引入一种新颖的VAC方法，称为Irregular Video Action Counting（IVAC），来解决这一不足。IVAC优先考虑建模视频中的不规则重复模式，我们通过两个主要方面对其进行定义：跨周期一致性和周期间隔不一致性。跨周期一致性确保周期段的时空表示的同质性，表示周期内动作的一致性。周期间隔不一致性强调基于固有内容差异区分周期段和间隔的重要性。为了概括这些原则，我们提出了一种新方法论",
