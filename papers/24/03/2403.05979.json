This study investigates the importance of effective feature selection in enhancing the performance of classification models. By employing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, specifically Q-learning (QL) and SARSA learning, this paper addresses the feature selection challenge. Using the Breast Cancer Coimbra dataset (BCCDS) and three normalization methods (Min-Max, l1, and l2), the study evaluates the performance of these algorithms. Results show that QL@Min-Max and SARSA@l2 achieve the highest classification accuracies, reaching 87% and 88%, respectively. This highlights the effectiveness of RL-based feature selection methods in optimizing classification tasks, contributing to improved model accuracy and efficiency.",
