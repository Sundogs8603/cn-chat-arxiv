    "translated_abstract": "具有丰富属性的图在建模互联实体和改进各种实际应用中的预测方面至关重要。传统图神经网络（GNNs）通常用于建模带属性的图，但需要在应用于不同图任务和数据集时进行重新训练。尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）的出现在自然语言处理中引入了新的范例，但LLMs在图挖掘中的生成潜力仍未得到充分探索。为此，我们提出了一个新颖的框架 MuseGraph，它无缝整合了GNNs和LLMs的优势，并促进了一种更有效和通用的图挖掘方法，可跨不同任务和数据集使用。具体而言，我们首先通过提出的自适应输入生成引入一个紧凑的图描述，以在语言令牌限制的约束下封装来自图的关键信息。",
