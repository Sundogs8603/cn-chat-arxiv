This report delves into the potential and limitations of generative deep learning models, such as diffusion models, in fabricating convincing synthetic images. We critically assess the accessibility, practicality, and output quality of these tools and their implications in threat scenarios of deception, influence, and subversion. Notably, the report generates content for several hypothetical cyber influence operations to demonstrate the current capabilities and limitations of these AI-driven methods for threat actors. While generative models excel at producing illustrations and non-realistic imagery, creating convincing photo-realistic content remains a significant challenge, limited by computational resources and the necessity for human-guided refinement.
