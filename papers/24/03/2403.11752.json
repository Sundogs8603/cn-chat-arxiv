    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.11752v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Rhymes and poems are a powerful medium for transmitting cultural norms and societal roles. However, the pervasive existence of gender stereotypes in these works perpetuates biased perceptions and limits the scope of individuals' identities. Past works have shown that stereotyping and prejudice emerge in early childhood, and developmental research on causal mechanisms is critical for understanding and controlling stereotyping and prejudice. This work contributes by gathering a dataset of rhymes and poems to identify gender stereotypes and propose a model with 97\\% accuracy to identify gender bias. Gender stereotypes were rectified using a Large Language Model (LLM) and its effectiveness was evaluated in a comparative survey against human educator rectifications. To summarize, this work highlights the pervasive nature of gender stereotypes in literary works and reveals the potential of LLMs to rectify gender stereotypes. This study raises ",

    "translated_abstract": "韵律诗是传递文化规范和社会角色的强大媒介。然而，这些作品中普遍存在的性别刻板印象延续了有偏见的认知，并限制了个体身份的范围。这项工作通过收集一组韵律诗和诗歌数据集，识别性别刻板印象并提出了一个准确率为97%的模型，用于识别性别偏见。通过使用大型语言模型（LLM）纠正了性别刻板印象，并在与人类教育者纠正策略的比较调查中评估了其有效性。总之，这项工作突显了文学作品中性别刻板印象的普遍性，并揭示了大型语言模型纠正性别刻板印象的潜力。",
