    "translated_abstract": "Analogy-making对于人类认知至关重要，使我们能够适应新颖情境--这是当前人工智能系统仍然缺乏的能力。大多数类比数据集今天关注简单的类比（例如，词类比）；包含复杂类型类比的数据集通常是手工策划的，并且非常小。我们认为这限制了计算类比的进展。在这项工作中，我们设计了一个数据生成流水线，ParallelPARC（Parallel Paragraph Creator），利用最先进的大型语言模型（LLM）来创建基于段落的复杂类比，以及简单和具有挑战性的干扰项。我们展示了我们的流水线，并创建了ProPara-Logy，一个关于科学过程间类比的数据集。我们发布了一个由人类验证过的金标准数据集，以及一个自动生成的银标准数据集。我们在二进制和多选环境中测试了LLMs和人类对类比的识别，发现人类胜过最佳模型。",
