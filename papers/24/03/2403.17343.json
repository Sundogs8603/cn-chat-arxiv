    "translated_abstract": "在这项研究中，我们揭示了基于残差的大型语言模型（LLMs）在生物医学成像任务中作为编码器的意想不到的有效性，这是传统上缺乏语言或文本数据的领域。该方法不同于已建立的方法，通过利用从预训练的LLMs中提取的冻结变压器块作为创新的编码器层，直接处理视觉令牌。这种策略与通常依赖于语言驱动提示和输入的标准多模态视觉语言框架有着显著的不同。我们发现这些LLMs能够提升各种生物医学成像应用的性能，包括2D和3D视觉分类任务，充当即插即用的助推器。更有趣的是，作为副产品，我们发现所提出的框架实现了卓越的性能，在M的广泛、标准化数据集中取得了新的最先进结果。",
