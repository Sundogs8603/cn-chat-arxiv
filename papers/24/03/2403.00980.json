    "translated_abstract": "最近，“只要”解释中的反事实在可解释人工智能（eXplainable AI，XAI）领域变得非常流行，因为它们描述了对黑盒AI系统的特征输入进行哪些更改会导致（通常是负面的）决策结果的变化。更近期，使用“即使”解释的半事实方法引起了更多关注。它们阐明了对AI系统的特征输入进行的更改不会改变决策结果，从而可能提出更有利的行动建议。一些半事实方法使用反事实来引导查询实例以指导半事实生成（称为反事实引导方法），而其他方法则不这样做（称为无反事实方法）。在这项工作中，我们对7个数据集上的8种半事实方法进行了全面测试，使用了5个关键指标，以确定反事实指导是否有必要找到最佳的半事实。这些测试的结果表明并不是，而是...",
