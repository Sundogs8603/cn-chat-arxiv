In this study, we present first evidence that generative AI can increase the speed of learning substantially in university students. We tested whether using the AI-powered teaching assistant Syntea affected the speed of learning of hundreds of distance learning students across more than 40 courses at the IU International University of Applied Sciences. Our analysis suggests that using Syntea reduced their study time substantially--by about 27\\% on average--in the third month after the release of Syntea. Taken together, the magnitude of the effect and the scalability of the approach implicate generative AI as a key lever to significantly improve and accelerate learning by personalisation.",

    "translated_abstract": "Generative AI预计将对教育产生巨大积极影响; 但是，目前尚未在大学层面展示这种潜力。在这项研究中，我们首次提出证据表明，生成式AI能够显著提高大学生的学习速度。我们测试了是否使用AI动力学辅导助手Syntea影响了IU国际应用科学大学40多个课程中数百名远程学习学生的学习速度。我们的分析表明，使用Syntea在Syntea发布后第三个月显著减少了他们的学习时间--平均约减少了27\\%。总的来说，该效应的幅度和方法的可扩展性证明了生成式AI作为显著改进和加快学习的关键杠杆。",
