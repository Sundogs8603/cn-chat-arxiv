    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.11369v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: This paper investigates the question of what makes math word problems (MWPs) challenging for large language models (LLMs). We conduct an in-depth analysis of the key linguistic and mathematical characteristics of MWPs. In addition, we train feature-based classifiers to better understand the impact of each feature on the overall difficulty of MWPs for prominent LLMs and investigate whether this helps predict how well LLMs fare against specific categories of MWPs.",
