    "translated_abstract": "随着随机系统的观测、实验和模拟数据快速增加，人们为了找到这些系统演化背后的控制规律进行了大量努力。尽管非高斯波动在许多物理现象中有着广泛的应用，但用于提取具有Lévy噪声的随机动力学的数据驱动方法相对较少。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种弱配对回归（WCR）方法，来明确揭示未知的随机动力系统，即具有$\\alpha$-稳定Lévy噪声和高斯噪声的随机微分方程（SDE），从离散的聚合数据中。此方法利用概率分布函数的演化方程，即福克-普朗克（FP）方程。通过FP方程的弱形式，WCR构建了一个未知参数的线性系统，其中所有积分都通过蒙特卡罗方法进行评估。",
