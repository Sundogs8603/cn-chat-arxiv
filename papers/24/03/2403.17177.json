    "translated_abstract": "脑卒中分割在脑卒中患者的诊断和治疗中发挥着关键作用，通过提供受影响脑区域的空间信息和受损程度。准确分割脑卒中病变是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为传统的手工技术耗时且容易出错。最近，先进的深度模型已被引入用于一般医学图像分割，展示出在特定数据集上评估时超越许多最先进网络的有前景结果。随着视觉Transformer的出现，已经基于它们引入了几种模型，而其他一些则旨在设计基于传统卷积层来提取像Transformer这样的长程依赖的更好模块。是否对所有分割案例都需要这样高级别的设计来实现最佳结果的问题尚未得到解答。在这项研究中，我们选择了四种类型的深度学习模型",
