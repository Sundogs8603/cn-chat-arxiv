    "translated_abstract": "人工智能的进展在揭示声子显微镜（高频超声波）数据中的基本信息以识别癌细胞方面显示出巨大潜力。然而，这项技术受到“批次效应”的影响，这是由于每次实验之间无法避免的技术变化所造成的，这些变化会产生混淆变量，使人工智能模型可能会无意中学习到。因此，我们提出了一个多任务条件神经网络框架，旨在同时实现批间校准，通过消除混淆变量，并对基于时间分辨声子信号的细胞准确分类。我们通过在不同的实验批次上进行训练和验证来验证我们的方法，实现了背景、健康和癌症区域分类的平衡精度为89.22％，交叉验证平均精度为89.07％。分类可在0.5秒内完成，只需要简单的先前批次信息。",
