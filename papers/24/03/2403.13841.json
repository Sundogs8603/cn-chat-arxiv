    "translated_abstract": "情绪状态作为情感的指标对整体健康至关重要，因此在其发作前准确预测是至关重要的。目前的研究主要集中在使用来自可穿戴和移动设备的数据进行与短期情感检测。这些研究通常专注于客观的感官测量，往往忽略其他形式的自我报告信息，如日记和笔记。在本文中，我们提出了一种用于情感状态预测的多模态深度学习模型。该模型结合了一个transformer编码器和一个预训练语言模型，实现了客观指标和自我报告日记的综合分析。为了验证我们的模型，我们进行了一项纵向研究，招募了大学生并在一年内对其进行监测，收集了包括生理、环境、睡眠、代谢和身体活动参数在内的广泛数据集，同时参与者提供了开放式文本日记。",
