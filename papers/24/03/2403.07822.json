However, autoencoders, like all artificial neural networks, are often unidentifiable and uninterpretable. This research focuses on creating an identifiable and interpretable autoencoder that can be used to meld and combine climate data products. The proposed autoencoder utilizes a Bayesian statistical framework, allowing for probabilistic interpretations while also varying spatially to capture useful spatial patterns across the various data products. Constraints are placed on the autoencoder as it learns patterns in the data, creating an interpretable consensus that includes the important features from each input. We demonstrate the utility of the autoencoder by combining information from multiple precipitation products in High Mountain Asia.",

    "translated_abstract": "自编码器是强大的机器学习模型，用于压缩来自多个数据源的信息。然而，像所有人工神经网络一样，自编码器通常是不可识别且不可解释的。本研究旨在创建一个可识别和可解释的自编码器，用于混合和合并气候数据产品。所提出的自编码器利用贝叶斯统计框架，允许概率性解释，同时在空间上变化以捕捉各种数据产品之间的有用空间模式。在自编码器学习数据模式时对其施加约束，形成一个可解释的共识，包括每个输入中的重要特征。我们通过将来自多个降水产品的信息结合在高山亚洲展示了自编码器的实用性。",
