    "translated_abstract": "随着脉冲神经网络（SNN）是事件驱动的，能效比传统人工神经网络（ANN）更高。由于SNN通过离散脉冲传递数据，难以使用梯度方法进行训练，限制了其准确性。为了保持SNN的准确性与ANN相似，需要将预先训练的ANN转换为SNN（即从ANN到SNN的转换）。在转换过程中，将ANN的激活编码成一组脉冲在SNN中是关键的，以最小化转换损失。本文提出了一种单脉冲相位编码作为一种编码方案，该方案最小化了在SNN层之间传输数据所需的脉冲数量。为了减少相位编码中由单脉冲近似导致的编码误差，提出了阈值偏移和基本操作。在ANN上没有额外的重新训练或架构约束的情况下，该转换方法不会失去推理准确性（平均为0.58%）。",
