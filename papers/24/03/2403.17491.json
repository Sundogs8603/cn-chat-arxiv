However, such models face problems of generalization and expensive training costs. The use of large language models (LLMs) to solve the task of generating paper abstracts saves the cost of model training. However, due to the hallucination problem of LLM, it is often necessary to improve the reliability of the results through multi-round query prompt approach such as Graph of Thoughts (GoT), which also brings additional reasoning costs. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph of Thought (DGoT). It not only inherits the advantages of the existing GoT prompt approach, but also dynamically adjust the graph structure according to data characteristics while reducing model reasoning cost. Experimental results show that our method's cost-effectiveness in abstract generation tasks is only 43",

    "translated_abstract": "基于领域数据集训练语言模型的方法在生成科学论文摘要的任务中取得了重要成就。然而，这些模型面临着泛化和昂贵的训练成本等问题。使用大型语言模型（LLMs）来解决生成论文摘要的任务可以节省模型训练成本。然而，由于LLM的幻觉问题，通常需要通过多轮查询提示方法（如思维图（GoT））来提高结果的可靠性，但也带来了额外的推理成本。本文提出了一种动态思维图（DGoT），它不仅继承了现有的GoT提示方法的优点，而且根据数据特征动态调整图结构，同时减少了模型推理成本。实验结果表明，我们的方法在生成摘要任务中具有非常好的性价比。",
