    "translated_abstract": "神经符号学习通常包括两个独立世界，即神经网络训练和符号约束求解，其成功取决于符号接地，这是人工智能中的一个基本问题。本文提出了一种新颖的软化符号接地过程，弥合了两个世界之间的差距，从而形成了一个有效且高效的神经符号学习框架。技术上，该框架具有以下特点：(1)将符号解状态建模为Boltzmann分布，避免了昂贵的状态搜索，并促进了网络训练和符号推理之间的互惠互利交互；(2)利用投影和SMT解算器的新型MCMC技术，高效地从断开的符号解空间中采样；(3)一种退火机制，可以摆脱陷入次优符号接地的困境。对三个代表性的神经符号学习任务进行的实验表明，该框架具有显著提高",
