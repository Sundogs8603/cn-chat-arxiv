As a result, images created on raw visibility data are of low quality. Recent studies have used deep learning models to reconstruct visibility data to get cleaner images. However, these methods rely on a substantial amount of labeled training data, which requires significant labeling effort from radio astronomers. Addressing this challenge, we propose VisRec, a model-agnostic semi-supervised learning approach to the reconstruction of visibility data. Specifically, VisRec consists of both a supervised learning module and an unsupervised learning module. In the supervised learning module, we introduce a set of data augmentation functions to produce diverse training examples. In comparison, the unsupervised learning module in VisRec augments unlabeled data and uses reconstructions from non-augmented visibility data as pseudo-labels for t",

    "translated_abstract": "射电望远镜产生关于天体对象的可见性数据，但这些数据稀疏且嘈杂。因此，基于原始可见性数据创建的图像质量较低。最近的研究使用深度学习模型重建可见性数据，以获得更清晰的图像。然而，这些方法依赖大量标记的训练数据，这需要射电天文学家大量的标注工作。针对这一挑战，我们提出了VisRec，一种面向模型的半监督学习方法，用于重建可见性数据。具体来说，VisRec包括监督学习模块和无监督学习模块。在监督学习模块中，我们引入一组数据增强函数来产生多样化的训练示例。相比之下，在VisRec中的无监督学习模块会增加未标记的数据，并使用来自非增强可见性数据的重建作为伪标签。",
