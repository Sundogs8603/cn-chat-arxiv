Different situations could affect the availability of EO sources, like noise, clouds, or satellite mission failures. In this work, we assess the impact of missing temporal and static EO sources in trained models across four datasets with classification and regression tasks. We compare the predictive quality of different methods and find that some are naturally more robust to missing data. The Ensemble strategy, in particular, achieves a prediction robustness up to 100%. We evidence that missing scenarios are significantly more challenging in regression than classification tasks. Finally, we find that the optical view is the most critical view when it is missing individually.",

    "translated_abstract": "地球观测（EO）应用涉及复杂和异构数据源，通常采用机器学习模型进行处理。然而，人们普遍假设数据源将持续可用。不同情况可能影响EO数据源的可用性，如噪声、云层或卫星任务失败。本研究评估了在四个数据集上进行的分类和回归任务中缺失时间性和静态EO数据源对训练模型的影响。我们比较了不同方法的预测质量，并发现一些方法在面对缺失数据时自然更加稳健。特别是集成策略实现了高达100%的预测稳健性。我们发现缺失情景在回归任务中比分类任务更具挑战性。最后，我们发现光学视角在单独缺失时是最关键的视角。",
