Conventionally, there is only one slot for ad display and most current studies focus on it. Nowadays, multi-slot display advertising is gradually becoming popular where many ads could be displayed in a list and shown as a whole to users. However, multi-slot display advertising leads to different cost-effectiveness. Advertisers have the incentive to adjust bid prices so as to win the most economical ad positions. In this study, we introduce bid shading into multi-slot display advertising for bid price adjustment with a Multi-task End-to-end Bid Shading(MEBS) method. We prove the optimality of our method theoretically and examine its performance experimentally. Through extensive offline and online experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, and we obtain a 7.01% lift in Gross Merchandise Volume, a 7.42% lift in Return on Inv",

    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.02607v1 公告类型: 交叉摘要: 在线竞价和拍卖是在线广告行业的关键方面。传统上，只有一个广告槽位用于广告展示，大多数当前研究都集中在此。如今，多槽位展示广告逐渐流行起来，可以在列表中展示许多广告，并整体展示给用户。然而，多槽位展示广告导致不同的成本效益。广告主有动机调整竞标价格，以赢得最经济的广告位置。在这项研究中，我们引入了出价遮蔽到多槽位展示广告中，通过一种多任务端到端出价遮蔽（MEBS）方法进行竞价价格调整。我们在理论上证明了我们方法的最优性，并通过实验证明了其性能。通过大量的离线和在线实验，我们展示了我们方法的有效性和效率，并获得了毛利量的7.01%增长，投资回报率的7.42%增长。",
