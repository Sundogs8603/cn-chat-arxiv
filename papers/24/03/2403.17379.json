    "translated_abstract": "情感分析是文本处理中不断探索的领域，涉及对文本的意见、情感和主观性的计算分析。然而，这个想法不仅限于文本和语音，事实上，它也可以应用于其他形式。实际上，人类在音乐中表达自己的深度不如在文本中。计算模型解释音乐情感的能力在很大程度上尚未被探索，可能对治疗和音乐播放等方面产生影响和用途。本文涉及两个独立任务。该研究旨在(1)预测音乐片段随时间的情感，以及(2)在时间序列中确定音乐后的下一个情感值，以确保无缝过渡。利用包含从Free Music Archive中选中并用Russel的af圆环模型报告的愉悦和激活水平注释的歌曲片段的Emotions in Music数据库的数据。",
