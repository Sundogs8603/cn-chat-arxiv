    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务中显示出巨大潜力，但其性能通常受到高质量、以推理为重点的训练数据稀缺的影响。为解决这一挑战，我们提出了基于关键点驱动的数据合成（KPDDS），这是一个新颖的数据合成框架，通过利用来自真实数据源的关键点和示例对生成问题-答案对。KPDDS确保通过严格的质量控制和大规模性能的生成新颖问题。因此，我们提出了KPMath，迄今为止量身定制的最广泛的用于数学推理的合成数据集，包括一百万个以上的问题-答案对。利用KPMath并将其与其他推理密集的语料库进行扩充，我们创建了全面的KPMath-Plus数据集。将Mistral-7B模型在KPMath-Plus上微调，使其在MATH测试集上实现零-shot PASS@1精度达到39.3%，这是一项突破性成就。",
