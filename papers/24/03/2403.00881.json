In this paper, we propose FedRDMA, a communication-efficient cross-silo FL system that integrates RDMA into the FL communication protocol. To overcome the limitations of RDMA in wide-area networks (WANs), FedRDMA divides the updated model into chunks and designs a series of optimization techniques to improve the efficiency and robustness of RDMA-based communication. We implement FedRDMA atop the industrial federated learning framework and evaluate it on a real-world cross-silo FL scenario. The experimental results show that \\sys can achieve up to 3.8$\\times$ speedup in communication efficiency compared to traditional TCP/IP-based FL systems.",

    "translated_abstract": "通信开销是联邦学习（FL）中的一个重要瓶颈，随着AI模型规模的增加，这一瓶颈越来越明显。本文提出了FedRDMA，一个通信高效的跨边缘FL系统，将RDMA集成到FL通信协议中。为了克服RDMA在广域网（WANs）中的限制，FedRDMA将更新后的模型分成块，并设计了一系列优化技术来改善基于RDMA的通信的效率和鲁棒性。我们在工业联邦学习框架上实现了FedRDMA，并在实际跨边缘FL场景中进行了评估。实验结果表明，与传统基于TCP/IP的FL系统相比，\\sys的通信效率最多可以提高3.8倍。",
