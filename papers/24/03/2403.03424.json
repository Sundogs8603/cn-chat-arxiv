However, they overlook the high-level connections among different news articles and also ignore the profound relationship between these news articles and users. And the definition of these methods dictates that they can only deliver news articles as-is. On the contrary, integrating several relevant news articles into a coherent narrative would assist users in gaining a quicker and more comprehensive understanding of events. In this paper, we propose a novel generative news recommendation paradigm that includes two steps: (1) Leveraging the internal knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the Large Language Model (LLM) to perform high-level matching between candidate news and user representation; (2) Generating a coherent and logically structured narrative based on t",
