We aimed to prove the feasibility by evaluating the content of the pest management advice generated by LLMs, including the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series from OpenAI and the FLAN series from Google. Considering the context-specific properties of agricultural advice, automatically measuring or quantifying the quality of text generated by LLMs becomes a significant challenge. We proposed an innovative approach, using GPT-4 as an evaluator, to score the generated content on Coherence, Logical Consistency, Fluency, Relevance, Comprehensibility, and Exhaustiveness. Additionally, we integrated an expert system based on crop threshold data as a baseline to obtain scores for Factual Accuracy on whether pests found in crop fields should take management act",

    "translated_abstract": "在人工智能领域快速发展的背景下，大型语言模型（LLMs）在农业领域，尤其是在害虫管理方面的应用仍处于初期阶段。我们旨在证明通过评估由开放AI的Generative Pre-trained Transformer（GPT）系列和谷歌的FLAN系列生成的害虫管理建议的内容的可行性。考虑到农业建议的特定情境属性，自动衡量或量化LLMs生成的文本质量成为一项重大挑战。我们提出了一种创新方法，使用GPT-4作为评估器，对生成的内容在连贯性、逻辑一致性、流畅性、相关性、可理解性和全面性上进行打分。此外，我们集成了基于作物阈值数据的专家系统作为基准，以获取有关作物田间发现害虫是否需要采取管理措施的实际准确性评分。",
