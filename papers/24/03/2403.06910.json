    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.06910v1 公告类型：新的 摘要：我们的研究致力于推进负责任人工智能（AI）的概念，在欧盟政策讨论中日益重要。欧盟最近发布了几份强调AI信任必要性的出版物，强调AI作为有益工具和潜在武器的双重性质。这种二元性突显了国际监管的迫切需要。与此同时，需要指导公司在AI发展中遵守这些规定的框架。我们的研究旨在帮助立法者和机器学习从业者在AI监管不断发展的背景下导航，确定未来关注的焦点领域。本文介绍了负责任AI的全面且据我们所知第一个统一定义。通过结构化文献综述，我们阐明了对负责任AI的当前理解。借鉴这一分析，我们提出了",
