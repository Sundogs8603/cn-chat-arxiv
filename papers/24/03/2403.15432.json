    "translated_abstract": "最近 EEG 基于脑机接口技术的进展揭示了通过整合传感、计算、通信和控制实现脑到机器人协作的潜力。在本文中，我们介绍了 BRIEDGE 作为一个端到端系统，用于通过 EEG 自适应神经网络和编解码通信框架实现多脑到多机器人交互，如图1所示。正如所描绘的那样，边缘移动服务器或边缘便携服务器将从用户收集 EEG 数据，并利用 EEG 自适应神经网络识别用户的意图。编解码通信框架然后对 EEG 基础的语义信息进行编码，并在数据传输过程中解码成命令。为了更好地提取异质 EEG 数据的联合特征以及增强分类准确性，BRIEDGE 引入了一种基于 Informer 的 ProbSparse 自注意机制。同时，平行和安全的进行转移。",
