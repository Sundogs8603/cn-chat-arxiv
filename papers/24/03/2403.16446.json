    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型(LLMs)由于在自然语言建模方面的卓越表现，对于提高医学诊断的临床效率越来越受到关注。为了确保安全和可靠的临床应用，评估LLMs的确变得至关重要，以更好地减轻潜在风险，例如幻觉。然而，目前的评估方法很大程度上依赖于劳动密集型的人类参与来获得人类偏好的判断。为了应对这一挑战，我们提出了一种定制的自动评估范式，旨在评估LLMs在提供临床服务(例如疾病诊断和治疗)方面的能力。该评估范式包含三个基本要素：度量、数据和算法。具体来说，受专业临床实践途径的启发，我们制定了一个LLM特定的临床途径(LCP)，以定义医生代理应具备的临床能力。",
