However, with diversified behavior data, user behavior sequences will become very long in the short term, which brings challenges to the efficiency of the sequence recommendation model. Meanwhile, some behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user interests. To address the aforementioned issues, firstly, we develop the Efficient Behavior Sequence Miner (EBM) that efficiently captures intricate patterns in user behavior while maintaining low time complexity and parameter count. Secondly, we design hard and soft denoising modules for different noise types and fully explore the relationship between behaviors and noise. Finally, we introduce a contrastive loss function along with a guided training strategy to compare the valid information in the data with the noisy signal, and seamles",

    "translated_abstract": "在推荐系统中，用户经常参与多种类型的行为，比如点击、加入购物车和购买。然而，由于具有多样化行为数据，用户行为序列在短期内会变得非常长，这给序列推荐模型的效率带来了挑战。与此同时，一些行为数据也会给用户兴趣建模带来不可避免的噪音。为了解决上述问题，首先，我们开发了高效行为序列挖掘器（EBM），能够高效捕捉用户行为中的复杂模式，同时保持低时间复杂度和参数数量。其次，我们为不同类型的噪音设计了硬性和软性去噪模块，并充分探索行为和噪音之间的关系。最后，我们引入了对比损失函数以及引导训练策略，以比较数据中的有效信息与噪音信号，从而无缝地",
