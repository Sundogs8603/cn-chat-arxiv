    "translated_abstract": "负载频率控制（LFC）广泛应用于电力系统中，以稳定频率波动并保证电力质量。然而，大多数现有的LFC方法依赖于准确的电力系统建模，并通常忽略系统的非线性特性，限制了控制器的性能。为了解决这些问题，本文提出了一种基于深度确定性策略梯度（DDPG）框架的非线性电力系统无模型LFC方法。所提出的方法建立了一个仿真器网络来模拟电力系统动态。在定义动作值函数之后，仿真器网络被应用于控制动作的评估，而不是评论网络。然后，演员网络控制器通过基于零阶优化（ZOO）和反向传播算法的策略梯度来有效优化。模拟结果和相应的比较表明，设计的控制器可以产生良好的控制效果。",
