However, unlike programming, statistics, and data management, discussion of ethical implications is rarely included in standard data science training. To begin to address this gap, we designed and tested a toolbox called the data ethics emergency drill (DEED) to help data science teams discuss and reflect on the ethical implications of their work. The DEED is a roleplay of a fictional ethical emergency scenario that is contextually situated in the team's specific workplace and applications.

    "translated_abstract": "研究人员敦促数据科学家等技术从业者考虑算法决策的影响和伦理影响。然而，与编程、统计和数据管理不同，对伦理影响的讨论很少包含在标准数据科学培训中。为了开始解决这一差距，我们设计和测试了一个名为数据伦理紧急演练（DEED）的工具箱，以帮助数据科学团队讨论和反思其工作的伦理影响。 DEED是一个虚构的伦理紧急场景的角色扮演，其情境地处于团队具体的工作场所和应用中。本文概述了DEED工具箱，并描述了两个不同数据科学团队进行的三项研究，这些研究在设计上进行了迭代。我们的研究结果表明，从角色扮演中学到的经验可以应用于现实生活中的情况，并且DEED如何引发了关于伦理的讨论。",
