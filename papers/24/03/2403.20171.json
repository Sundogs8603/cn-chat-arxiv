For a portfolio of super-Pareto losses, non-diversification is preferred by decision makers equipped with well-defined and monotone risk measures. The phenomenon that diversification is not beneficial in the presence of super-Pareto losses is further illustrated by an equilibrium analysis in a risk exchange market.
