In this paper, we propose a novel graph edge protection framework, graph publisher (GraphPub), which can protect graph topology while ensuring that the availability of data is basically unchanged.

    "translated_abstract": "近年来，随着图神经网络（GNN）的快速发展，越来越多的图数据集被用于GNN任务。然而，当上游数据所有者发布图数据时，往往会存在许多隐私问题，因为许多现实世界的图数据包含像个人的朋友列表等敏感信息。差分隐私（DP）是一种常用的保护隐私的方法，但由于图数据的复杂拓扑结构，将DP应用在图上往往会影响GNN模型的消息传递和聚合，导致模型准确性下降。本文提出了一种新颖的图边保护框架GraphPub，可以保护图拓扑结构同时确保数据的可用性基本不变。通过反向学习和编码器-解码器机制，我们搜索一些对节点特征聚合没有太大负面影响的虚假边。",
