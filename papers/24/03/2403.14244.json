However, it uses anisotropic Gaussian kernels to represent the scene. Although such anisotropic kernels have advantages in representing the geometry, they lead to difficulties in terms of computation, such as splitting or merging two kernels. In this paper, we propose to use isotropic Gaussian kernels to avoid such difficulties in the computation, leading to a higher performance method. The experiments confirm that the proposed method is about {\\bf 100X} faster without losing the geometry representation accuracy. The proposed method can be applied in a large range applications where the radiance field is needed, such as 3D reconstruction, view synthesis, and dynamic object modeling.",

    "translated_abstract": "3D高斯飘屑方法因其在训练中的高性能和渲染图像的高质量而备受关注。然而，它使用各向异性的高斯核来表示场景。虽然这种各向异性核在表示几何方面具有优势，但在计算方面会导致诸如分裂或合并两个核的困难。本文提出使用同性质高斯核来避免计算中的这些困难，从而导致一种性能更高的方法。实验证实，所提出的方法比原方法快约100倍，而不会丢失几何表示的准确性。所提出的方法可应用于需要辐射场的大范围应用，如3D重建、视图合成和动态对象建模。",
