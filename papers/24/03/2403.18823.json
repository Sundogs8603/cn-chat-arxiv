In today's globalized landscape, even subtle shifts in one nation's public debt landscape can have significant impacts on that of international finances, necessitating a nuanced understanding of the correlations between international and national markets to help investors make informed investment decisions. Therefore, by leveraging the capabilities of artificial intelligence, this study utilizes neural networks to depict the correlations between US and International Public Finances and predict the changes in international public finances based on the changes in US public finances. With the neural network model achieving a commendable Mean Squared Error (MSE) value of 2.79, it is able to affirm a discernible correlatio",

    "translated_abstract": "公共财政是经济治理的基本机制之一，指的是政府实体为资助公共服务、项目和运营活动而做出的金融活动和决策。在当今全球化的背景下，一个国家公共债务领域的细微变化都可能对国际金融产生重大影响，这要求我们对国际和国内市场之间的相关性有一个细致的理解，以帮助投资者做出明智的投资决策。因此，本研究利用人工智能的能力，采用神经网络描绘了美国和国际公共财政之间的相关性，并根据美国公共财政的变化预测国际公共财政的变化。神经网络模型取得了可观的均方误差（MSE）值为2.79，能够确认明显的相关性。",
