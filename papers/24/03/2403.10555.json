    "translated_abstract": "基于深度学习的数据驱动模型在气候研究中越来越普遍，特别是在全球天气预测方面。然而，以高分辨率训练全球天气数据需要大量的计算资源。因此，我们提出了一种名为KARINA的新模型，以克服该领域典型的巨大计算需求。该模型通过只需4个NVIDIA A100 GPU和不到12小时的训练时间，即可实现与更高分辨率对手相媲美的预测准确性，从而大大减少了计算资源的需求。KARINA结合了ConvNext、SENet和Geocyclic填充以增强以2.5°分辨率进行的天气预测，可以过滤掉高频噪声。地理周期填充保留了输入图像的侧边界像素，从而在球形地球中保持大气流的连续性。SENet动态改善特征响应，推进了大气过程建模。",
