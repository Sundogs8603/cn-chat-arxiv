    "translated_abstract": "深度学习模型在病理图像分析领域的细胞核分割中表现出令人期待的性能。然而，训练一个来自多个领域的强大模型仍然是细胞核分割的巨大挑战。此外，背景噪声、细胞核之间高度重叠以及模糊边缘的缺点经常导致性能不佳。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种称为CausalCellSegmenter的新颖框架，它将因果推断模块（CIM）与多样化聚合卷积（DAC）技术相结合。DAC模块被设计为通过一个简单、无参数的关注模块（SimAM）将不同的下采样特征整合在一起，旨在解决误报识别和边缘模糊问题。此外，我们引入CIM来利用样本加权，通过直接消除每个输入样本之间的虚假相关性来聚焦。",
