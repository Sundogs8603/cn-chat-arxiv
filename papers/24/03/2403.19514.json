    "translated_abstract": "近年来，关于不完整多视图聚类的研究正逐渐受到关注，该研究探讨了在缺失视图上的具有挑战性的多视图聚类问题。尽管已经提出了一系列方法来解决这一问题，但以下问题仍然存在：1）几乎所有现有方法都是基于浅层模型，很难获得有区分力的共同表示。2）这些方法通常对噪声或异常值敏感，因为负样本被视为与重要样本同等重要。在本文中，我们提出了一种新颖的不完整多视图聚类网络，称为认知式深度不完整多视图聚类网络（CDIMC-net），以解决这些问题。具体而言，它通过将视图特定的深度编码器和图嵌入策略纳入框架来捕获每个视图的高级特征和局部结构。此外，根据人类认知，即",
