    "translated_abstract": "熵条件在提取系统守恒律的物理相关解时起着至关重要的作用，因此促使构建满足离散条件的熵稳定方案。 TeCNO方案（Fjordholm等，2012）形成了一类任意高阶熵稳定有限差分求解器，它们需要满足每个单元格界面的符号特性的专业重构算法。最近，设计了满足符号特性的第三阶WENO方案，称为SP-WENO（Fjordholm和Ray，2016）和SP-WENOc（Ray，2018）。然而，这些WENO算法在震荡附近的性能可能很差，数值解表现出大的人工振荡。在本研究中，我们提出了SP-WENO的一个变种，称为Deep Sign-Preserving WENO（DSP-WENO），在其中，一个神经网络被训练来学习WENO加权策略。",
