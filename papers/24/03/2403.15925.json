This paper presents a methodology for constructing a hedge fund index that is more like a quantitative fund of fund, rather than a weighted sum of a number of early replicable market indices, which are re-balanced periodically. The constructed index allows hedge funds to directly hedge their exposures to index-linked products. That is important given that hedge funds are an asset class with reduced transparency, and the returns are traditionally difficult to replicate using liquid instruments.",

    "translated_abstract": "一项对冲基金指数对于跟踪对冲基金投资表现非常有用，尤其是对基金赎回的时机。本文提出了一种构建对冲基金指数的方法，它更像是一个量化的基金池，而不是一些早期可复制的市场指数的加权和，这些指数定期重新平衡。构建的指数允许对冲基金直接对冲其与指数相关的产品暴露。这一点非常重要，因为对冲基金是一种透明性较低的资产类别，其回报传统上很难使用流动性工具复制。",
