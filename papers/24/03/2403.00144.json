    "translated_abstract": "当我们用特定的翻译方向训练多语言模型时，零翻译的能力就会出现；模型可以直接在未见过的方向进行翻译。另外，零翻译也可以通过第三种语言（例如英语）来实现。在我们的工作中，我们发现直接和通过第三种语言进行的翻译都存在噪音，并且表现不尽如人意。我们提出了EBBS，一个具有新颖的双层束搜索算法的集成方法，其中每个集成组件在下层逐步探索自己的预测，但它们通过上层的“软投票”机制进行同步。在两个流行的多语言翻译数据集上的结果表明，EBBS始终优于直接和通过第三种语言进行的翻译，以及现有的集成技术。此外，我们可以将集成的知识传回到多语言模型中，以提高推理效率；值得注意的是，我们的E",
