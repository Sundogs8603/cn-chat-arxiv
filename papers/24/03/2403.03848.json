    "translated_abstract": "利用深度强化学习（RL）的运动控制器的最新进展在面对具有挑战性的地形时取得了令人印象深刻的结果，如崎岖的岩石、非刚性地面和滑溜的表面。然而，尽管这些控制器主要解决了机器人底部的挑战，但相对较少的研究研究了在受限的三维空间中的四肢移动性，比如狭窄的隧道或不规则的空洞，这些空间施加了全方位的约束。现有基于RL的方法产生的周期性步态模式学习参数化的运动技能，这些运动技能具有运动参数，如速度和身体高度，可能不足以使机器人在具有挑战性的受限三维空间中导航，需要具备敏捷的三维障碍物回避和强大的四肢运动。相反，我们建议从在受限的三维空间中的目标导航端到端地学习运动技能。",
