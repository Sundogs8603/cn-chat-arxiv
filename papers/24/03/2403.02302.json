    "translated_abstract": "最近，多模态大型语言模型（MLLMs）变得异常流行。像ChatGPT-4V和Gemini这样功能强大的商用模型，以及像LLaVA这样的开源模型，本质上都是通用模型，应用于解决各种各样的任务，包括计算机视觉中的任务。这些神经网络具有如此强大的通用知识和推理能力，以至于它们已被证明能够处理甚至未经专门训练的任务。我们将迄今为止最强大的MLLMs的能力进行了比较：ShareGPT4V、ChatGPT、LLaVA-Next 进行了专门任务的年龄和性别估计，与我们的最新专业化模型MiVOLO进行了比较。我们还更新了MiVOLO，并在本文中提供了详细信息和新的指标。这种比较产生了一些有趣的结果和关于参与模型的优点和缺点的见解。此外，我们尝试了各种微调方法",
