    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.11048v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Despite the success of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) in decision-making systems, their fairness remains unexplored, as the focus primarily lies on accuracy. This work conducts a design space exploration, unveiling QNN unfairness, and highlighting the significant influence of QNN deployment and quantum noise on accuracy and fairness. To effectively navigate the vast QNN deployment design space, we propose JustQ, a framework for deploying fair and accurate QNNs on NISQ computers. It includes a complete NISQ error model, reinforcement learning-based deployment, and a flexible optimization objective incorporating both fairness and accuracy. Experimental results show JustQ outperforms previous methods, achieving superior accuracy and fairness. This work pioneers fair QNN design on NISQ computers, paving the way for future investigations.",

    "translated_abstract": "尽管量子神经网络（QNNs）在决策系统中取得了成功，但其公平性仍未得到探索，因为主要关注点在于准确性。本文进行了设计空间探索，揭示了QNN的不公平性，并突显了QNN部署和量子噪声对准确性和公平性的显著影响。为了有效地遍历广阔的QNN部署设计空间，我们提出了JustQ，这是一个在NISQ计算机上部署公平准确QNN的框架。它包括完整的NISQ错误模型、基于强化学习的部署以及一个灵活的优化目标，同时考虑公平性和准确性。实验结果表明，JustQ优于先前的方法，实现了更高的准确性和公平性。本研究开创了NISQ计算机上公平QNN设计的先河，为未来的研究铺平了道路。",
