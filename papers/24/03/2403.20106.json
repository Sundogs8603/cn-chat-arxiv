    "translated_abstract": "图像去模糊是指从对应的模糊图像中恢复高质量图像的过程。近年来，深度学习模型如CNN和Transformer的出现使得在这一领域取得了重大进展。然而，这些方法往往面临着在消除远程模糊降解扰动和保持计算效率之间的两难境地，这制约了它们的实际应用。为解决这一问题，我们提出了一种有效的图像去模糊网络，利用选择性结构化状态空间模型来聚合丰富准确的特征。具体而言，我们设计了一个聚合局部和全局块（ALGBlock）来捕获和融合局部不变特性和非局部信息。ALGBlock由两个块组成：（1）局部块使用简化的通道注意力模型局部连通性。（2）全局块捕捉长距离依赖特征。",
