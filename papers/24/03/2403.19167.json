However, flawless CoT reasoning cannot be guaranteed due to the presence of indecomposable questions and the potential for erroneous reasoning chains, particularly in the case of small-scale language models. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach called the selective filtering reasoner (SelF-Reasoner) that assesses the entailment relationship between the question and the candidate reasoning chain.

    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型通过利用思维链推理技术解决复杂问题，展现了卓越的能力。然而，这种推理的效力取决于思维链的质量。为了解决这一挑战，我们提出了一种名为选择性过滤推理器（SelF-Reasoner）的新方法，该方法评估问题与候选推理链之间的蕴涵关系。当推理链展示出自信时，我们继续进行思维链推理；否则，我们选择直接预测答案。SelF-Reasoner在ScienceQA、ECQA和LastLetter任务上持续改善了经过微调的T5基线。",
