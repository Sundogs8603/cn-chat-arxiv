It is a challenging task due to limited, heterogeneous training data featuring a multi-domain structure; such data entail the danger of shortcut learning, where models learn general characteristics of peptide sources, such as the source organism, rather than specific peptide characteristics associated with T-cell response.   Using a transformer model for T-cell response prediction, we show that the danger of inflated predictive performance is not merely theoretical but occurs in practice. Consequently, we propose a domain-aware evaluation scheme. We then study different transfer learning techniques to deal with the multi-domain structure and shortcut learning. We demonstrate a per-source fine tuning approach to be effective across a wide range of peptid",
