Unlike prior LLM works in healthcare focusing on tasks like question answering, our work specifically focuses on long multi-turn voice conversations. Our one-trillion parameter constellation system is composed of several multibillion parameter LLMs as co-operative agents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging conversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks performed by nurses to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. We develop a sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that optimize for diverse objectives. We train our models on proprietary data, clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and other medical reasoning documents. We align our models to speak like medical professionals, using organic healthcare ",

    "translated_abstract": "我们开发了Polaris，这是第一个以安全为重点的LLM星座，用于实时患者 - AI医疗保健对话。与先前侧重于问题回答等任务的医疗保健LLM工作不同，我们的工作专门关注长时间的多轮语音对话。我们的兆个参数星座系统由多个数十亿参数的合作代理组成：一个有状态的主代理，专注于引导引人入胜的对话，以及几个专业支持代理，专注于护士执行的医疗保健任务，以提高安全性并减少幻觉。我们为代理的迭代协同训练开发了复杂的训练协议，优化各种目标。我们在专有数据、临床护理计划、医疗保健监管文件、医疗手册和其他医疗推理文件上训练我们的模型。我们使我们的模型与医疗专业人员说话一样，使用有机医疗术语。",
