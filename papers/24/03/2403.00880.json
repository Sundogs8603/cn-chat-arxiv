Medication recommendation aims to integrate patients' long-term health records with medical knowledge, recommending accuracy and safe medication combinations for specific conditions. However, most existing researches treat medication recommendation systems merely as variants of traditional recommendation systems, overlooking the heterogeneity between medications and diseases. To address this challenge, we propose DGMed, a framework for medication recommendation. DGMed utilizes causal inference to uncover the connections among medical entities and presents an innovative feature alignment method to tackle heterogeneity issues.

    "translated_abstract": "随着医疗需求增长和机器学习技术的进步，基于人工智能的诊断和治疗系统备受关注。药物推荐旨在将患者的长期健康记录与医学知识整合，为特定疾病推荐准确和安全的药物组合。然而，大多数现有研究将药物推荐系统仅视为传统推荐系统的变体，忽视了药物和疾病之间的异质性。为解决这一挑战，我们提出了DGMed，一个用于药物推荐的框架。DGMed利用因果推断揭示医学实体之间的联系，并提出了一种创新的特征对齐方法来解决异质性问题。具体而言，该研究首先应用因果推断分析历史记录中药物对特定疾病的量化治疗效果，揭示...",
