    "translated_abstract": "为了实现有效的人-智能体协作，机器人和其他人工智能（AI）代理必须推断他们的人类伙伴的能力和行为响应模式，并相应地进行调整。大多数先前的工作都作出了一个不切实际的假设，即一个或多个队友可以在接近最优的情况下行动。在现实世界的协作中，人类和自主代理可能是次优的，特别是当每个人只拥有部分领域知识时。在这项工作中，我们开发了用于增强次优人-智能体团队表现的计算建模和优化技术，其中人类和代理具有不对称的能力，并且由于环境知识不完整而表现次优。我们采用一种在线贝叶斯方法，使机器人能够推断人们在顺序决策游戏中是否愿意遵从其帮助。我们的用户研究表明，用户偏好和团队表现确实随着机器人介入风格而变化。",
