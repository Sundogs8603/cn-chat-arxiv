    "translated_abstract": "说话人嵌入的聚类对说话人分离至关重要，但与其他组件相比，尚未得到足够关注。此外，在开发和评估数据来自不同领域时，跨各种数据集评估说话人分离的稳健性也尚未被探讨。为填补这一空白，本研究彻底研究了光谱聚类在相同领域和跨领域说话人分离中的应用。我们在两个广泛使用的语料库AMI和DIHARD上进行了大量实验，揭示了领域不匹配情况下说话人分离性能趋势。我们观察到在两种不同领域条件下的性能差异可以归因于光谱聚类的作用。特别是在其他模块保持不变的情况下，我们展示了最优调参参数以及说话人计数估计的差异起源于不匹配。这项研究为说话人分离研究开辟了几个未来方向。",
