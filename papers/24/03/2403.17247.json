    "translated_abstract": "我们考虑一种设置，其中$N$个智能体旨在通过并行操作并与中央服务器通信来加速一个常见的随机逼近（SA）问题。我们假定上行传输到服务器的传输受到异步和潜在无界时变延迟的影响。为了减轻延迟和落后者的影响，同时又能获得分布式计算的好处，我们提出了一种名为DASA的延迟自适应多智能体随机逼近算法。我们对DASA进行了有限时间分析，假设智能体的随机观测过程是独立马尔科夫链。与现有结果相比，DASA是第一个其收敛速度仅取决于混合时间$tmix$和平均延迟$\\tau_{avg}$，同时在马尔科夫采样下实现N倍的收敛加速的算法。我们的工作对于各种SA应用是相关的。",
