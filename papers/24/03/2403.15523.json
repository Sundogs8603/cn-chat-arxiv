This pilot study makes a first step towards AAD using the noise-tagging stimulus protocol, which evokes reliable code-modulated evoked potentials, but is minimally explored in the auditory modality. Participants were sequentially presented with two Dutch speech stimuli that were amplitude modulated with a unique binary pseudo-random noise-code, effectively tagging these with additional decodable information. We compared the decoding of unmodulated audio against audio modulated with various modulation depths, and a conventional AAD method against a standard method to decode noise-codes.

    "translated_abstract": "听觉注意力解码(AAD)旨在从大脑活动中提取被关注的说话者，提供了神经导向听觉设备和脑机接口等领域的应用前景。本试点研究首次尝试使用噪声标记刺激协议进行AAD，该协议引发了可靠的编码调制诱发电位，但在听觉模式下的探索还很有限。研究参与者依次呈现两个荷兰语言语音刺激，这些刺激被幅度调制为具有唯一二进制伪随机噪声码，有效地为其标记了附加可解码信息。我们比较了未调制音频与使用不同调制深度调制的音频的解码，以及传统AAD方法与标准解码噪声码方法的对比。我们的试点研究发现，与未调制音频相比，70至100%的调制深度的传统方法表现出更高的性能。",
