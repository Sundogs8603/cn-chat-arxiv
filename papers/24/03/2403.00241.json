    "translated_abstract": "写作科学文章是一项具有挑战性的任务，因为它是一种高度规范化和具体的体裁，因此精通书面交流对有效传达研究发现和观点至关重要。在本文中，我们提出了一个关于科学文章写作过程中修订步骤的原始文本资源。这个名为CASIMIR的新数据集包含来自OpenReview的15,646篇科学文章的多个修订版本，以及它们的同行评审。文章的连续版本对在句子级别对齐，同时保留段落位置信息作为支持未来修订研究的元数据在语篇级别。每一对修订后的句子都通过自动提取的编辑和相关修订意图进行了丰富。为了评估数据集的初始质量，我们对几种最先进的文本修订方法进行了定性研究，并进行了比较。",
