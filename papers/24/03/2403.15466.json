However, the precondition for these applications to function normally is that the license plate must be 'clear' enough to be recognized by the system with the correct license plate number. If the license plate becomes blurred due to some external factors, then the accuracy of recognition will be greatly reduced. Although there are many road surveillance cameras in Taiwan, the quality of most cameras is not good, often leading to the inability to recognize license plate numbers due to low photo resolution. Therefore, this study focuses on using super-resolution technology to process blurred license plates. This study will mainly fine-tune three super-resolution models: Real-ESRGAN, A-ESRGAN, and Star",

    "translated_abstract": "随着技术的强劲发展，车牌识别技术现在可以在各种场景中得到适当应用，如道路监控、被盗车辆追踪、停车场出入口检测等。然而，这些应用正常运行的前提是车牌必须足够“清晰”，才能被系统识别出正确的车牌号码。如果由于外部因素使车牌变模糊，那么识别的准确性将大大降低。尽管台湾有许多道路监控摄像头，但大多数摄像头的质量不佳，经常导致由于照片分辨率低而无法识别车牌号码。因此，这项研究着重于使用超分辨率技术处理模糊的车牌。本研究主要将对三个超分辨率模型进行微调：Real-ESRGAN、A-ESRGAN和StarSRGAN。",
