While often considered as a source of humor and entertainment, memes can also disseminate hateful content targeting individuals or communities. Most existing research focuses on the negative aspects of memes in high-resource languages, overlooking the distinctive challenges associated with low-resource languages like Bengali (also known as Bangla). Furthermore, while previous work on Bengali memes has focused on detecting hateful memes, there has been no work on detecting their targeted entities. To bridge this gap and facilitate research in this arena, we introduce a novel multimodal dataset for Bengali, BHM (Bengali Hateful Memes). The dataset consists of 7,148 memes with Bengali as well as code-mixed captions, tailored for two tasks: (i) detecting hateful memes, and (ii) detecting the social entities they target",

    "translated_abstract": "互联网表情包已经成为个人在社交媒体上表达情感、思想和观点的强大手段。虽然通常被视为一种幽默和娱乐来源，但表情包也可以传播针对个人或社区的仇恨内容。大多数现有研究侧重于高资源语言中表情包的负面方面，忽视了低资源语言（如孟加拉语）所面临的独特挑战。此外，尽管之前关于孟加拉语表情包的工作集中在检测仇恨表情包上，但并没有对它们的目标实体进行检测。为了弥补这一差距并促进这一领域的研究，我们引入了一个面向孟加拉语的新颖多模态数据集BHM（孟加拉仇恨表情包）。该数据集包含7,148个带有孟加拉语以及混合代码字幕的表情包，专为两项任务量身定制：（i）检测仇恨表情包，以及（ii）检测它们所针对的社会实体。",
