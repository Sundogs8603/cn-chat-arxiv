    "translated_abstract": "电子表格操作广泛存在于大多数日常工作中，并显著提高了工作效率。最近尝试使用大型语言模型(LLM)进行自动电子表格操作，但尚未在存在推理挑战的复杂和现实任务中进行探究（例如，具有多步推理和模糊要求的长视野操作）。为了弥合与真实世界要求之间的差距，我们引入了$\\textbf{SheetRM}$，一个特点是长视野和多类任务的基准，具有推理相关操纵，由真实挑战引起。为了缓解以上挑战，我们进一步提出了$\\textbf{SheetAgent}$，一种利用LLMs能力的新型自主代理。SheetAgent由三个协作模块组成：$\\textit{Planner}$、$\\textit{Informer}$和$\\textit{Retriever}$，实现了对电子表格的高级推理和准确操作，而不需人类",
