    "translated_abstract": "明显的是，当前，生成模型在质量上被人类专业人士超越。然而，随着人工智能的进步，这种差距将会缩小，导致那些投入了多年时间来掌握一项技能的个体因其高昂成本而变得过时，这种成本与他们完成任务所需的时间紧密相连 -- 一项人工智能可以在几分钟或几秒钟内完成的任务。为了避免未来的社会动荡，我们必须即刻思考如何公平评估这些个体在训练生成模型中的贡献，并如何补偿他们由此而导致的收入减少或完全丧失。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种方法来构建模型开发者和数据提供者之间的合作关系。为了实现这一目标，我们利用Shapley Values来量化Stable Diffusion-v1.5模型生成的图像中艺术家的贡献，并公平地对待他们。",
