    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.06035v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Shareholders' expectations of stock returns and fluctuations are constantly changing due to restrictions in financial status and undesirable capital structure, which constrain managers to limit the changes in price trends in order to cover the risk instigated and infused by the unfavorable situation. The present research examines the moderating impact of information asymmetry on the relationship between capital structure adjustment and expected returns. The data from 120 companies approved in the Tehran Stock Exchange were extracted, and a hybrid data regression model was used to test the research hypotheses. Findings indicate that the capital structure adjustment speed correlates with the expected returns. Moreover, the information asymmetry positively affects the relationship between capital structure adjustment speed and expected returns.",

    "translated_abstract": "股东对股票回报和波动的期望不断变化，受到财务状况限制和不良资本结构的影响，这限制了管理者限制价格趋势的变化，以覆盖由不利情况引发和注入的风险。本研究考察了信息不对称对资本结构调整与预期收益之间关系的调节影响。提取了在德黑兰证券交易所上市的120家公司的数据，并采用混合数据回归模型来测试研究假设。研究结果表明，资本结构调整速度与预期收益相关。此外，信息不对称积极影响资本结构调整速度与预期收益之间的关系。",
