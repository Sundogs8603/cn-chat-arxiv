We demonstrate that clinical annotations such as calipers, and the combination of zero-padded convolutions and center-cropped training sets in the dataset can inadvertently serve as shortcuts, impacting segmentation accuracy.

    "translated_abstract": "捷径学习是一种现象，机器学习模型优先学习简单、潜在误导的数据提示，这些提示在训练集之外很难泛化。现有研究主要探讨这一现象在图像分类领域，而这项研究将捷径学习探索延伸到医学图像分割中。我们证明，临床注释如卡尺，以及数据集中零填充卷积和中心裁剪的组合可以无意中作为捷径，影响分割准确性。我们在两个不同但常见的医学图像分割任务中识别和评估了捷径学习。此外，我们提出了缓解捷径学习影响、提高分割模型泛化能力的策略。通过揭示医学图像分割中捷径的存在和影响，我们提供了一些见解。",
