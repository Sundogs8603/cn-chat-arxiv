    "translated_abstract": "智能辅导系统通过优化学习材料的选择和时间安排来增强理解和长期记忆。这需要对学习者的进度（''知识追踪''; KT）和学习领域的先决条件结构（''知识映射''）进行估计。在最近的深度学习模型中，高KT准确性是可以实现的，但这是以牺牲心理启发模型的解释性为代价的。在这项工作中，我们提出了一个解决这种权衡的方案。PSI-KT是一种分层生成方法，明确建模了个体认知特征和知识的先决结构如何影响学习动态，从而通过设计实现可解释性。此外，通过使用可扩展的贝叶斯推断，PSI-KT针对现实世界中对高效个性化的需求，即使有着不断增长的学习者群体和学习历史。在在线学习平台的三个数据集上进行了评估。",
