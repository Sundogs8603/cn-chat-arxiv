    "translated_abstract": "本文旨在通过基于MapReduce的子群体发现方法对海量开放在线课程（MOOCs）中的不同类型学习者进行分类和描述。最终目标是发现出现在不同MOOC中的IF-THEN规则。所提出的子群体发现方法是对著名的FP-Growth算法的扩展，考虑了MapReduce等新兴并行方法，以应对极大型数据集。作为附加特性，该提案包括一个阈值数值，用于指示每个发现的规则应满足的课程数量。还包括后处理步骤，以删除多余的子群体。实验阶段通过考虑来自edX平台上16门MITx和HarvardX课程首年的去标识化数据进行。实验结果表明，所提出的MapReduce方法胜过传统顺序子群体方法。",
