    "translated_abstract": "通过经典模拟来进行基准测试是在没有无噪声硬件可用之前评估量子机器学习思想的主要方式之一。然而，实验设计对结果的巨大影响，当前可达到的小规模，以及受量子技术商业化影响的叙述使得难以获得稳健的见解。为了促进更好的决策，我们开发了一个基于PennyLane软件框架的开源软件包，并使用它进行了大规模研究，系统地测试了12种流行的量子机器学习模型在用于创建160个单独数据集的6个二元分类任务上。我们发现，总体而言，开箱即用的经典机器学习模型胜过量子分类器。此外，从量子模型中移除纠缠往往会导致同样或更好的性能，这表明“量子特性”可能并非关键成分。",
