    "translated_abstract": "政治学家中越来越多的人开始利用图像中丰富的信息。然而，解读这些图像的挑战在于需要计算机视觉领域的专业知识和专门硬件的访问。因此，图像分析一直局限于政治科学界中的一小部分人群。由于大型语言模型（LLMs）的崛起，这种情况有可能发生变化。本文旨在提高使用Gemini进行图像内容分析的可行性意识。对688幅图像语料库进行了回顾性分析。对每幅图像从Gemini中获取内容报告，然后由作者手动评估。我们发现Gemini在执行对象检测方面非常准确，这在政治科学中是可能最常见和基本的图像分析任务。同样重要的是，我们展示了使用Gemini进行图像内容分析是简单的。",
