    "translated_abstract": "在机器人领域中，快速而稳健的物体抓取是至关重要的。本文指出当前大多数研究都仅利用整个观察到的点云来生成六自由度的抓取，忽略了从全局语义中挖掘的引导信息，从而限制了高质量抓取的生成和实时性能。为此，本文展示了广泛使用的热图在六自由度抓取生成效率方面被低估。因此，我们提出了一个有效的局部抓取生成器，并结合抓取热图作为引导，以全局到局部语义到点的方式进行推断。具体来说，我们应用了高斯编码和基于网格的策略来预测抓取热图以指导将局部点聚合到可抓取区域，并提供全局语义信息。此外，设计了一种新颖的非均匀锚定采样机制来提高抓取的准确性和多样性。受益于图像空间中的高效编码",
