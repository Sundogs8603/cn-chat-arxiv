    "translated_abstract": "长尾推荐对传统推荐系统来说是一个具有挑战性的任务，主要是由于数据稀疏和数据不平衡问题。最近大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展展示了它们在复杂推理方面的能力，可以帮助基于非常少的先前交互来推断用户的偏好。然而，由于大多数基于LLM的系统仅依赖于物品的语义含义作为推理的唯一证据，忽略了用户-物品交互的协作信息，这可能导致LLM的推理与数据集的任务特定协作信息不一致。为了进一步将LLMs的推理与任务特定的用户-物品交互知识相一致，我们引入了协作检索增强LLMs，称为CoRAL，直接将协作证据纳入交互中。基于检索到的用户-物品交互，LLMs可以分析用户之间的共享和不同偏好，并总结",
