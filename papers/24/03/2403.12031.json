    "translated_abstract": "随着大型语言模型（LLMs）的应用范围不断扩大，对有效的服务解决方案的需求变得日益关键。尽管LLMs具有多样性，但没有单一模型可以最优地解决所有任务和应用，特别是在平衡性能和成本之间。为了弥补这一限制，发展了LLM路由系统，这些系统结合了各种模型的优势，以克服单个LLMs的约束。然而，缺乏用于评估LLM路由器性能的标准化基准测试，阻碍了这一领域的进展。为弥合这一差距，我们提出了ROUTERBENCH，这是一个新颖的评估框架，旨在系统评估LLM路由系统的功效，以及一个包括来自代表性LLMs的超过405k推理结果的全面数据集，以支持路由策略的开发。我们进一步提出了一个LLM路由的理论框架，以及...",
