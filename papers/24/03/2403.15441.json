    "translated_abstract": "先进的生成模型（例如扩散模型）源自对数据分布的简化连续性假设，尽管显示出了良好的进展，但由于分子几何的多模态性和对噪声敏感的特性，很难直接应用于几何生成应用。本文引入了几何贝叶斯流网络（GeoBFN），通过在可微分参数空间中建模不同模态，自然地适配分子几何形状。GeoBFN通过在分布参数上合成移变相互依赖建模，保持了SE-(3)不变密度建模属性，并统一了不同模态的概率建模。通过优化的训练和采样技术，我们展示了GeoBFN在多个3D分子生成基准中取得了最先进的性能，最大限度地提高了生成质量（在QM9中稳定生成90.87%的分子，在原子方面稳定生成85.6%）",
