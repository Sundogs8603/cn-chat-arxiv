Emerging from prediction competitions in Psychology and Decision Science, the method evaluates a group of candidate models of varying type and structure across multiple scientific, theoretic, and practical criteria. Ordinal ranking of criteria scores are evaluated using voting rules from the field of computational social choice and allow the comparison of divergent measures and types of models in a holistic evaluation.
