    "translated_abstract": "图神经网络（GNNs）在捕捉图中节点之间的关系方面已被证明是有效的。本研究通过考虑将图作为一个单纯复合体的新视角，包含节点、边、三角形和k-单纯体，从而使得可以在任何k-单纯体上定义图结构数据。我们的贡献是Hodge-Laplacian异构图注意网络（HL-HGAT），旨在学习跨k-单纯体的异构信号表示。HL-HGAT包含三个关键组件：HL卷积滤波器（HL-filters）、单纯投影（SP）和单纯注意池化（SAP）运算符，应用于k-单纯体。HL-filters利用由Hodge-Laplacian（HL）算子编码的k-单纯体的独特拓扑结构，在k-th HL算子的频谱域内运作。为了解决计算挑战，我们介绍了一种HL-filters的多项式逼近，展示了在谱域解决异构图注意跨k-单纯体的计算挑战。",
