Addressing this issue through early diagnosis and prevention could significantly reduce the disease's impact. This work introduces a methodology for HF risk prediction using clinically acquired 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). We present a novel, lightweight dual-attention ECG network designed to capture complex ECG features essential for early HF prediction, despite the notable imbalance between low and high-risk groups. The network features a cross-lead attention module and twelve lead-specific temporal attention modules to capture cross-lead interactions and local temporal dynamics within each lead. To prevent model overfitting from limited training data, we leverage a large language model (LLM) with a public ECG-Report dataset for pretraining on an ECG-report alignment task. The network is then fine-tuned for HF risk prediction",

    "translated_abstract": "心力衰竭（HF）由于全球死亡率不断上升而构成重大公共卫生挑战。通过早期诊断和预防来解决这一问题可显著减少疾病对社会的影响。本文引入了一种使用临床获取的12导联心电图（ECG）进行HF风险预测的方法。我们提出了一种新颖的、轻量级的双注意力ECG网络，旨在捕捉对早期HF预测至关重要的复杂心电图特征，尽管低风险和高风险组之间存在明显的不平衡。该网络具有一个跨导注意力模块和12个导联特定的时间注意力模块，以捕捉交叉导联交互作用和每个导联内的局部时间动态。为了防止模型过拟合于有限的训练数据，我们利用一个大型语言模型（LLM）与公共ECG-Report数据集进行预训练，用于进行ECG-报告对齐任务。然后对网络进行fine-tune以用于HF风险预测",
