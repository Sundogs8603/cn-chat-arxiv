    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.11843v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Choquet distance using fuzzy rough set based measures. The proposed distance measure combines the attribute information received from fuzzy rough set theory with the flexibility of the Choquet integral. This approach is designed to adeptly capture non-linear relationships within the data, acknowledging the interplay of the conditional attributes towards the decision attribute and resulting in a more flexible and accurate distance. We explore its application in the context of machine learning, with a specific emphasis on distance-based classification approaches (e.g. k-nearest neighbours). The paper examines two fuzzy rough set based measures that are based on the positive region. Moreover, we explore two procedures for monotonizing the measures derived from fuzzy rough set theory, making them suitable for use with the Choquet integral, and investigate their differences.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文介绍了一种基于模糊粗糙集合度量的新型Choquet距离。所提出的距离度量结合了从模糊粗糙集理论中获得的属性信息和Choquet积分的灵活性。这种方法旨在适应性地捕捉数据中的非线性关系，认识到条件属性与决策属性之间的相互作用，并实现更灵活与准确的距离度量。我们探讨了它在机器学习中的应用，特别强调基于距离的分类方法（例如k最近邻）。本文研究了两种基于正区域的模糊粗糙集度量，并探讨了两种根据模糊粗糙集理论导出的用于适用Choquet积分的单调化程序，以及它们之间的差异。",
