This study delves into university instructors' experiences and attitudes toward AI language models, filling a gap in the literature by analyzing educators' perspectives on AI's role in the classroom and its potential impacts on teaching and learning. The objective of this research is to investigate the level of awareness, overall sentiment towardsadoption, and the factors influencing these attitudes for LLMs and generative AI-based tools in higher education.

    "translated_abstract": "人工智能（AI）的快速发展和大型语言模型（LLMs）的不断整合引发了关于它们在教育中应用的讨论。本研究深入探讨大学教师对AI语言模型的经验和态度，通过分析教育者对AI在课堂中的作用以及对教学和学习潜在影响的观点，填补了文献中的空白。本研究的目标是调查高等教育中LLMs和生成式AI工具的认知水平、采纳的总体情绪以及影响这些态度的因素。数据通过利用李克特量表进行的调查收集，同时辅以跟进访谈以更细致地了解教师的观点。收集到的数据使用统计和主题分析技术进行处理。我们的研究结果显示，教育工作者对生成式AI和大型语言模型的工具的态度逐渐变得积极。",
