    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.06843v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Nowadays, there is evidence that several factors may increase the risk, for an infant, to require stabilisation or resuscitation manoeuvres at birth. However, this risk factors are not completely known, and a universally applicable model for predicting high-risk situations is not available yet. Considering both these limitations and the fact that the need for resuscitation at birth is a rare event, periodic training of the healthcare personnel responsible for newborn caring in the delivery room is mandatory.   In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for identifying risk factors and their impact on the birth event from real data, which can be used by personnel to progressively increase and update their knowledge. Our final goal will be the one of designing a user-friendly mobile application, able to improve the recognition rate and the planning of the appropriate interventions on high-risk patients.",

    "translated_abstract": "如今，有证据表明几个因素可能增加婴儿在出生时需要稳定或复苏操作的风险。然而，这些风险因素尚未完全知晓，并且目前尚无适用于预测高风险情况的普遍模型。考虑到这些限制和出生时需要进行复苏的需求相对罕见，有必要对负责分娩室新生儿护理的医护人员进行定期培训。本文提出了一种机器学习方法，用于从实际数据中识别风险因素及其对分娩事件的影响，这可以帮助人员逐步增加和更新他们的知识。我们的最终目标是设计一个用户友好的移动应用程序，能够提高高风险患者的识别率和规划适当的干预措施。",
