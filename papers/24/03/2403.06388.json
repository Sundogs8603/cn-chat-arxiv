    "translated_abstract": "了解生成式AI（GenAI）攻击对电力网络的潜在影响是一个基本挑战，必须解决以保护电力网络免受新攻击向量的风险。本文提出了一个新颖的用于电力网络供应链（PGSC）的零信任框架，该框架有助于早期检测潜在的GenAI驱动攻击向量（例如重放和协议型攻击），评估基于尾部风险的稳定性措施，并减轻此类威胁。首先，设计并构建了PGSC的新零信任系统模型，将其形成为一个寻求通过实现和防御GenAI驱动的网络攻击来保证PGSC稳定的零信任问题。其次，开发了一种基于领域特定生成对抗网络（GAN）的攻击生成机制，以为进一步了解威胁而创建一个新的易受攻击的网络空间。第三，基于尾部风险的稳定性措施评估和减轻网络攻击。",
