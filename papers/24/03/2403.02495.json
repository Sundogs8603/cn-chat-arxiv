    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.02495v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: The prevailing grasp prediction methods predominantly rely on offline learning, overlooking the dynamic grasp learning that occurs during real-time adaptation to novel picking scenarios. These scenarios may involve previously unseen objects, variations in camera perspectives, and bin configurations, among other factors. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, SSL-ConvSAC, that combines semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning for online grasp learning. By treating pixels with reward feedback as labeled data and others as unlabeled, it efficiently exploits unlabeled data to enhance learning. In addition, we address the imbalance between labeled and unlabeled data by proposing a contextual curriculum-based method. We ablate the proposed approach on real-world evaluation data and demonstrate promise for improving online grasp learning on bin picking tasks using a physical 7-DoF Franka Emika robot arm with a suction grippe",

    "translated_abstract": "目前的抓取预测方法主要依赖于离线学习，忽视了实时适应新颖挑选场景中发生的动态抓取学习。本文引入一种新方法SSL-ConvSAC，将半监督学习和强化学习相结合，用于在线抓取学习。通过将带有奖励反馈的像素视为标记数据，其他像素视为未标记数据，有效地利用未标记数据以增强学习。此外，我们提出了一种基于情境课程的方法来解决标记和未标记数据之间的不平衡。我们在真实世界的评估数据上验证了所提方法，并展示了利用具有吸盘夹具的物理7自由度Franka Emika机械臂改进在线抓取学习的潜力。",
