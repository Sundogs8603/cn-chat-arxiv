    "translated_abstract": "在计算机视觉领域，将先进技术整合到RGB-D相机输入处理中构成了重大挑战，因为环境条件的多样性和物体外观的变化带来了固有的复杂性。因此，本文介绍了FusionVision，一种为在RGB-D图像中鲁棒地进行3D物体分割而调整的详尽管道。传统计算机视觉系统在同时捕捉精确的物体边界并在深度图上实现高精度物体检测方面存在局限，因为它们主要是为RGB摄像机提出的。为了解决这一挑战，FusionVision采用了综合方法，通过将最先进的物体检测技术与先进的实例分割方法相结合。这些组件的整合使得能够对从彩色RGB和深度D信道获得的信息进行全面统一的解释",
