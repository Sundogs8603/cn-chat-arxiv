Most previous work focuses on using RAG for single-round question answering, while how to adapt RAG to the complex conversational setting wherein the question is interdependent on the preceding context is not well studied. In this paper, we propose a conversation-level RAG approach, which incorporates fine-grained retrieval augmentation and self-check for conversational question answering (CQA). In particular, our approach consists of three components, namely conversational question refiner, fine-grained retriever and self-check based response generator, which work collaboratively for question understanding and relevant information acquisition in conversational settings.

    "translated_abstract": "检索增强生成（RAG）旨在通过向大型语言模型（LLMs）增加外部庞大而动态的知识，生成更可靠和准确的响应。本文提出了一种面向对话式问答（CQA）的会话级RAG方法，其中包括细粒度检索增强和自检。我们的方法包括对话式问题细化器、细粒度检索器和基于自检的响应生成器三个组件，它们在对话情境中协作工作，用于问句理解和相关信息获取。广泛实验证明，我们的方法在对话式问答中具有巨大优势。",
