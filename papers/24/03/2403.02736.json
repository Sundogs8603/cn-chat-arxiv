    "translated_abstract": "稀有物体检测是应用地理空间机器学习中的一项基本任务，然而由于大量的高分辨率卫星或航空图像以及几乎没有标记的正样本，这往往是具有挑战性的。本文针对这一稀有物体检测任务的引导问题提出解决方案，假设没有标记数据，也没有有关感兴趣区域的空间先验信息。我们提出了新颖的离线和在线基于聚类的方法，用于采样贴片，这种方法在暴露正样本给人类标注者方面比随机采样要高效得多。我们将这些方法应用于肯尼亚和坦桑尼亚的Serengeti Mara地区的boma（牧群动物的小围场）识别。我们展示了检测效率的显著提升，将正样本采样率从2%（随机）提高到30%。这一进展使得即使只有有限的正样本标记，也能实现有效的机器学习映射。",
