    "translated_abstract": "冠状动脉疾病（CAD）是全球主要的死亡和住院原因。动脉粥样硬化是CAD最常见的原因，是一种逐渐狭窄动脉并具有潜在致命效果的炎症性疾病。然而，在动脉粥样硬化存在的情况下，循环经常通过侧支动脉的形成来适应，从而实现显著的长期健康效益。因此，及时检测冠状动脉侧枝循环（CCC）对于CAD个性化医学至关重要。我们提出了一种新颖的基于深度学习的方法来检测冠状动脉造影中的CCC。我们的方法依赖于卷积骨干从冠状动脉造影序列的每帧中提取空间特征。然后将这些特征连接起来，随后由另一个卷积层在时间上处理嵌入。由于数据稀缺，我们还尝试在预训练骨干模型上进行实验。",
