    "translated_abstract": "在这项研究中，作者提出了一种新的方法，能够破译多语言主题动态，并识别危机期间的交流趋势。我们关注突尼斯社交网络中在冠状病毒大流行期间以及其他显著主题（如体育和政治）中的对话。我们首先对与这些主题相关的各种多语言评论进行聚合。然后在数据预处理过程中对数据集进行了严格的精炼。我们引入我们的无英语到英语的机器翻译方法来处理语言差异。对这种方法的实证测试显示了很高的准确性和F1值，突显了它适用于语言一致任务的特点。深入研究，采用了先进的建模技术，特别是LDA和HDP模型，从翻译内容中提取相关主题。这导致应用ARIMA时间序列分析来解码不断变化的主题趋势。",
