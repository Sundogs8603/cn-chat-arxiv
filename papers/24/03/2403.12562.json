    "translated_abstract": "深度学习（DL）的最新进展得益于大规模数据和计算力的提升。这些大规模资源被用于训练日益庞大的模型，而这些模型在计算、数据、能源和碳排放方面消耗巨大。这些成本正在成为研究人员和从业者面临的新型准入障碍，特别是对于那些在全球南方地区资源有限的人。在这项工作中，我们全面审视了现有视觉任务的DL模型，并展示了它们在资源有限的环境中的实用性。为了考虑DL模型的资源消耗，我们引入了一个衡量性能与资源单元的新指标，我们称之为PePR分数。通过使用131种独特的DL架构（跨度从1M到130M个可训练参数）和三个医学图像数据集，我们获取了有关性能和资源之间关系的趋势。",
