    "translated_abstract": "鱼类库存评估通常需要由分类专家进行手工鱼类计数，这既耗时又昂贵。我们提出了一个自动化的计算机视觉系统，可以从使用低成本数码相机拍摄的图像中执行分类和鱼类大小估算。该系统首先利用Mask R-CNN执行目标检测和分割，以识别包含多条鱼的图像中的单条鱼，这些鱼可能由不同物种组成。然后，每个鱼类被分类并使用单独的机器学习模型预测长度。这些模型训练于包含50,000张手工注释图像的数据集，其中包含163种不同长度从10厘米到250厘米的鱼类。在保留的测试数据上评估，我们的系统在鱼类分割任务上达到了92%的交并比，单一鱼类分类准确率为89%，平均误差为2.3厘米。",
