    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们考虑了社会学习问题，其中一群嵌入在社交网络中的代理对学习世界的潜在状态感兴趣。代理人具有不完整、嘈杂和异质的信息来源，为他们提供了关于世界潜在状态的重复私人观察。代理人可以通过采取对同行可观察的行动来与同行分享他们的学习经验，这些行动的价值来自一个有限可行状态集。这些行动可以被解释为代理人可能形成和更新关于真实世界状态的信念的样本。分享样本，而不是完整的信念，是受到代理人特别是在大型人群中可用的通信、认知和信息处理资源有限的启发。先前的工作(Salhab等人)提出了这样一个问题：如果只允许代理人沟通，那么是否仍然可以实现概率为一的学习。",
