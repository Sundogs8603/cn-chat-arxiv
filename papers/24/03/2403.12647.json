Analyses of the causesd of abnormal fluctuations in the financial market to extract early warning indicators revealed that most early warning systems are qualitative and causal. However, these models cannot be used to forecast the risk of the financial market benchmark. Therefore, from a quantitative analysis perspective, we focus on the mean and volatility uncertainties of the stock index (benchmark) and then construct three early warning indicators: mean uncertainty, volatility uncertainty, and ALM-G-value at risk. Based on the novel warning indicators, we establish a new abnormal fluctuations warning model, which will provide a short-term warning for the country, society, and individuals to reflect in advance.",

    "translated_abstract": "金融与技术的融合与创新逐渐将金融系统转变为复杂的系统。分析金融市场异常波动的原因，提取早期预警指标，发现大多数早期预警系统是定性和因果的。然而，这些模型不能用于预测金融市场基准的风险。因此，从定量分析的角度出发，我们关注股指（基准）的均值和波动率不确定性，构建了三个早期预警指标：均值不确定性、波动率不确定性和ALM-G值-at-risk。基于这些新颖的预警指标，我们建立了一个新的异常波动预警模型，将为国家、社会和个人提供短期预警，提前反映。",
