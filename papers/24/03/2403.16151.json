In response to this growing challenge, we introduce a two-stage ultra-low-cost multimodal harmful behavior detection method designed to identify harmful comments and images with high precision and recall rates. We first utilize the CLIP-ViT model to transform tweets and images into embeddings, effectively capturing the intricate interplay of semantic meaning and subtle contextual clues within texts and images. Then in the second stage, the system feeds these embeddings into a conventional machine learning classifier like SVM or logistic regression, enabling the system to be trained rapidly and to perform inference at an ultra-low cost. By converting tweets into rich multimodal embeddings through the CLIP-ViT model and utilizing them to train conventional machine learning classifiers, our system is not only capable of detecting harmful textual info",
