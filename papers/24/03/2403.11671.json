    "translated_abstract": "在芯片设计领域，硬件描述语言（HDLs）发挥着至关重要的作用。然而，由于HDL的复杂语法和在线资源有限的问题，即使是经验丰富的工程师，调试HDL代码仍然是一项困难且耗时的任务。因此，迫切需要开发自动化HDL代码调试模型，以减轻硬件工程师的负担。尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在生成、完成和调试软件代码方面具有强大的能力，但它们在专门领域的HDL调试中的利用受到了限制，并且迄今为止尚未产生令人满意的结果。在本文中，我们提出了一个LLM辅助的HDL调试框架，即HDLdebugger，它包括通过逆向工程方法生成HDL调试数据，用于检索增强生成的搜索引擎，以及用于检索增强LLM微调的方法。",
