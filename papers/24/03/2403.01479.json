    "translated_abstract": "可扩展的深度模型和大规模数据集的出现提高了神经机器翻译的性能。知识蒸馏（KD）通过将知识从教师模型传输到更紧凑的学生模型来提高效率。然而，针对Transformer架构的KD方法通常依赖于启发式方法，特别是在决定要从哪些教师层中蒸馏知识时。本文介绍了“Align-to-Distill”（A2D）策略，旨在通过在训练过程中自适应地对齐学生注意力头与其教师对应物来解决特征映射问题。A2D中的注意力对齐模块执行学生和教师注意力头之间的密集逐头比较，将组合映射启发式方法转化为学习问题。我们的实验展示了A2D的有效性，对WMT-2022 De->Dsb和WMT-2014 En->De的BLEU分数分别获得高达+3.61和+0.63的提升。",
