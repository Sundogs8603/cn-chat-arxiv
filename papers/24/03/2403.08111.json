A dedicated CPD plugin for the online collaborative whiteboard platform Miro was developed to streamline diagram creation and offer real-time AI-driven guidance. Through a user study with designers (N=20), we found that CPD's branching and its emphasis on causal connections supported both divergent and convergent processes during design. CPD can also facilitate communication among stakeholders. Additionally, we found our plugin significantly reduces designers' cognitive workload and increases their creativity during brainstorming, highlighting the implications of AI-assisted tools in supporting creative work and evidence-based designs.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文探讨了将因果路径图（CPD）整合到人类中心设计（HCD）中，研究这些图如何增强设计过程的早期阶段。开发了专用的CPD插件，用于在线协作白板平台Miro，以简化图的创建并提供实时的AI驱动指导。通过与设计师（N=20）的用户研究，我们发现CPD的分支和其对因果关系的强调在设计过程的分散和集中阶段都得到了支持。CPD也可以促进利益相关者之间的沟通。此外，我们发现我们的插件显著减少了设计师的认知负荷，并在头脑风暴过程中增加了他们的创造力，突显了AI辅助工具在支持创造性工作和基于证据的设计中的影响。",
