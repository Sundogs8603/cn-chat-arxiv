In this study, we propose a deep neural networks PGN4 that performs well when using limited analytic features.

    "translated_abstract": "在赌博研究中，基于对用户每日行为数据的监控而执行分析特征。在执行问题赌博检测时，现有数据集为建立基于机器学习的模型提供了相对丰富的分析特征。然而，考虑到在实际应用中收集分析特征的复杂性和成本，使用更少的特征进行精确检测将极大减少数据收集成本。在这项研究中，我们提出了一个深度神经网络 PGN4，在使用有限的分析特征时表现良好。通过对两个数据集进行实验，我们发现当将102个特征减少到5个特征时，PGN4仅遭遇了轻微的性能下降。此外，我们发现了两个数据集中排名前5的特征的共同点。",
