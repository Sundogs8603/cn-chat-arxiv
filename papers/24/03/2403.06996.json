    "translated_title": "论人类和人工创造力的随机性",
    "translated_abstract": "什么构成人类创造力，计算机是否能够展现真正的创造力？我们认为，要实现计算机的人类水平智能，或者所谓的人工通用智能，必须同时达到人类水平的创造力。我们通过开发人类创造力的统计表征，结合随机理论、心理学、哲学、神经科学和混沌理论的先前见解，为这一讨论做出贡献。这突显了人类创造过程的随机性质，其中包括一个有偏向导向的随机提案步骤，以及依赖于灵活或可变偏向结构的评估步骤。获得的人类创造力表征随后被用来评估各种当代人工智能系统的创造力水平。我们的分析包括现代人工智能算法，如强化学习、扩散模型和大型语言模型，探讨了这些算法在多大程度上实现了人类创造力的水平。",
