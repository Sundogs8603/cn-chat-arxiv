    "translated_abstract": "人类历史上关于因果关系的讨论可以追溯到古希腊，然而直至今日仍没有共识。从根本上讲，这源于人类认知的本质，因果关系的理解需要超越人类认知局限的抽象工具。近几十年来，数学和计算工具的快速发展为探索因果关系提供了新的理论和技术手段，为研究开辟了更多途径。基于此，本文引入了由Samuel Eilenberg和Saunders Mac Lane于1945年提出的利用范畴论定义因果关系的新概念，以避免集合论中的自指矛盾，特别是罗素悖论。在这一框架内，演示了因果推断中指标综合的可行性。由于范畴论相关技术工具的发展存在局限性，本文采用了广泛使用的概率论",
