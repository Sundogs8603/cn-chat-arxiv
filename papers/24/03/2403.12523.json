    "translated_abstract": "事件描述实体的状态变化。在文档中，多个事件通过各种关系相互连接（例如，共指、时间、因果和子事件）。因此，通过事件之间的关系提取（ERE）获取事件之间的连接对于理解自然语言至关重要。当前ERE工作中存在两个主要问题：a. 仅使用事件触发器的嵌入来表示事件特征，忽略事件参数（例如，时间、地点、人物等）及其在事件内的结构。b. 关系之间的互连（例如，时间和因果关系通常会相互影响）被忽略。为解决上述问题，本文提出了一种名为GraphERE基于图增强事件嵌入的多重ERE框架。首先，我们利用静态AMR图和IE图丰富事件嵌入的事件参数和结构特征；然后，为了联合...",
