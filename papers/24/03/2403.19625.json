We demonstrate that several prevalent surrogate loss functions in multi-class classification, such as comp-sum and constrained losses, are supported by $H$-consistency bounds with respect to the top-$k$ loss. These bounds guarantee consistency in relation to the hypothesis set $H$, providing stronger guarantees than Bayes-consistency due to their non-asymptotic and hypothesis-set specific nature. To address the trade-off between accuracy and cardinality $k$, we further introduce cardinality-aware loss functions through instance-dependent cost-sensitive learning. For these functions, we derive cost-sensitive comp-sum and constrained surrogate losses, establishing their $H$-consistency bounds and Bayes-consistency.

    "translated_abstract": "我们详细研究了Top-$k$分类，即预测输入的$k$个最有可能的类别，超越了单类别预测。我们证明了多类别分类中几种流行的替代损失函数，如comp-sum和约束损失，对于Top-$k$损失具有关于$h$-一致性边界的支持。这些边界保证了关于假设集$H$的一致性，由于它们的非渐近和特定假设集性质，提供比贝叶斯一致性更强的保证。为了解决准确性和基数$k$之间的折衷，我们进一步通过实例相关的成本敏感学习引入了基数感知损失函数。对于这些函数，我们推导了成本敏感comp-sum和约束替代损失，建立了它们的$H$-一致性边界和贝叶斯一致性。最小化这些损失导致了新的基数感知算法",
