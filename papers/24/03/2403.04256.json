    "translated_abstract": "联邦推荐（FR）是一种新兴范式，能够实现隐私保护推荐。然而，传统的FR系统通常使用离散的身份（ID）表示用户/物品，在FR中由于数据稀疏性和异构性而导致性能下降。另一方面，大型语言模型（LLMs）作为推荐器已经在各种推荐场景中被证明有效。然而，基于LLM的推荐器面临诸如推理效率低和潜在幻觉等挑战，从而影响它们在实际场景中的表现。为此，我们提出了一个名为GPT-FedRec的联邦推荐框架，利用ChatGPT和一种新颖的混合检索增强生成（RAG）机制。GPT-FedRec是一个两阶段的解决方案。第一阶段是一个混合检索过程，挖掘基于ID的用户模式和基于文本的商品特征。接下来，所检索到的结果被转换为文本提示",
