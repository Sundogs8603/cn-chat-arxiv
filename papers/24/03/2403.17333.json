Developers should ensure that such models don't manifest any unexpected discriminatory practices like partiality for certain genders, ethnicities or disabled people. With the ubiquitous dissemination of AI systems, researchers and practitioners are becoming more aware of unfair models and are bound to mitigate bias in them. Significant research has been conducted in addressing such issues to ensure models don't intentionally or unintentionally perpetuate bias.

    "translated_title": "人工智能模型中的公平追求：一项调查",
    "translated_abstract": "现在，人工智能（AI）模型被广泛应用于医疗、教育和就业等方方面面。由于它们被应用于许多敏感环境，并做出可能改变人生的决策，潜在的偏见结果成为一个紧迫的问题。开发人员应确保这类模型不会表现出任何意外的歧视行为，比如偏爱某些性别、种族或残疾人士。随着人工智能系统的普遍传播，研究人员和从业者对不公平模型越来越有意识，并致力于减少其中的偏见。在解决这些问题方面已经进行了重要研究，以确保模型不会有意或无意地延续偏见。这项调查概述了研究人员如何促进人工智能系统的公平性。我们探讨了当前文献中存在的公平性不同定义。",
