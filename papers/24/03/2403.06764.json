    "translated_abstract": "在本研究中，我们发现大规模视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中的注意力计算存在低效现象，尤其是在知名模型如LLaVA-1.5、QwenVL-Chat和Video-LLaVA中。我们发现在流行的LVLMs的深层中，对视觉代币的注意力计算极其低效，暗示相较于处理文本数据，需要更稀疏的方法。为此，我们引入了FastV，这是一种多功能即插即用方法，旨在通过学习早期层中的自适应注意力模式和在随后层中修剪视觉代币来优化计算效率。我们的评估表明FastV能够显著降低计算成本（例如，对于LLaVA-1.5-13B的FLOP减少了45%），而不会在广泛的图像和视频理解任务中牺牲性能。FastV的计算效率和性能权衡是高度可定制的，并且是帕累托有效的。",
