    "translated_abstract": "对于对称群$\\mathcal{S}_n$的任意子群$G$，我们提出了关于由$G$不变多项式逼近$G$不变函数的$\\mathcal{C}^k$一致逼近结果。对于完全对称函数的情况($G = \\mathcal{S}_n$)，我们展示了这导致了Zaheer等人(2018)的sum-decomposition Deep Sets方法，其中内部和外部函数都可以选择为光滑函数，并且内部函数可以选择与被逼近的目标函数无关。特别地，我们展示了所需的嵌入维度与目标函数的正则性、期望逼近的准确性以及$k$无关。接下来，我们展示了一个类似的过程可以让我们得到反对称函数的$\\mathcal{C}^k$一致逼近作为$K$项的和，其中每一项均为光滑完全对称函数和光滑反对称函数之积。",
    "tldr": "该论文提出了一种新的方法，可以通过$G$不变多项式一致逼近$G$不变函数，同时能够获得反对称函数的统一$\\mathcal{C}^k$逼近。这种方法不仅可以应用于完全对称函数，还可以将嵌入维度独立于目标函数的正则性、逼近准确度和$k$。"
