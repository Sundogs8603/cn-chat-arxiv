    "translated_abstract": "多源无监督领域自适应（MSFDA）旨在通过使用源模型而非源数据，从多个良好标记的源域传递知识到一个未标记的目标域。现有的MSFDA方法局限于每个源域仅提供单一模型，并且具有统一结构。本文介绍了一种新的MSFDA设置：模型不可知的多源无监督领域自适应（MMDA），允许具有不同架构的多样化源模型，而不受定量限制。虽然MMDA具有良好的潜力，但合并大量源模型会增加包含不想要的模型的风险，从而突显出源模型选择问题。为了解决这个问题，我们首先对该问题进行了理论分析。我们揭示了两个基本选择原则：可转移性原则和多样性原则，并介绍了一个整合它们的选择算法。",
