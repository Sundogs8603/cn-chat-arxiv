However, it still remains a challenge to perform this evaluation reliably and efficiently. Recent work has focused on fact verification via prompting language model (LM) evaluators, however we demonstrate that these methods are unreliable in the presence of incomplete or inaccurate information. We introduce Facts as a Function (FaaF), a new approach to fact verification that utilizes the function calling abilities of LMs and a framework for RAG factual recall evaluation. FaaF substantially improves the ability of LMs to identify unsupported facts in text with incomplete information whilst improving efficiency and lowering cost by several times, compared to prompt-based approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "从参考资料中准确提取事实对于评估检索增强生成（RAG）系统的性能至关重要，因为它直接探查了检索和生成的质量。然而，可靠高效地执行这种评估仍然是一个挑战。最近的工作侧重于通过提示语言模型（LM）评估器进行事实验证，然而我们证明，在信息不完整或不准确的情况下，这些方法是不可靠的。我们引入了FaaF（Facts as a Function），这是一种利用LM的函数调用能力和面向RAG事实回忆评估的框架的新方法。与基于提示的方法相比，FaaF显着提高了LM识别文本中不支持事实的能力，同时提高了效率，降低了成本几倍。",
