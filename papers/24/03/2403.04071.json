    "translated_abstract": "小于50克的纳米无人机（nano-drones）在学术界和工业界都越来越受到关注。尽管受到硬件约束（如低于100毫瓦的处理器），它们最具吸引力的应用依赖于用于感知的设备端深度学习模型。当部署在训练数据中未表示的未知环境中时，这些模型经常由于领域转移而表现不佳。为了应对这一根本性问题，我们首次提出了在纳米无人机上进行设备端学习，其中现场任务的第一部分专门用于自监督微调预训练的卷积神经网络（CNN）。利用真实世界的基于视觉的回归任务，我们全面探讨了微调阶段在三个方面的性能成本权衡：i）数据集大小（更多数据可以提高回归性能，但需要更多内存和更长的计算）；ii）方法论等",
