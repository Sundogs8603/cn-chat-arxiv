Our research, conducted in six distinct environmental setups, demonstrates that Lamarckian systems outperform Darwinian ones in adaptability and efficiency, particularly in challenging conditions.

    "translated_abstract": "本研究探讨了将拉马克系统整合到进化机器人学（ER）中，通过比较其与传统达尔文模型在不同环境下的表现。通过采用拉马克原则，即机器人继承学习到的特征，同时进行达尔文学习而不继承，我们研究了在动态设置中的适应性。我们在六个不同的环境设置中进行的研究表明，拉马克系统在适应性和效率方面的表现优于达尔文系统，特别是在具有挑战性的条件下。我们的分析突出了控制器和形态进化以及环境适应之间的相互作用的关键作用，父代和子代之间的相似性，以及学习前后的新生和幸存者提供了有关特征继承有效性的见解。我们的研究结果表明，拉马克原则可能显著推动自主系统设计的进步，强调了更丰富的潜力。",
