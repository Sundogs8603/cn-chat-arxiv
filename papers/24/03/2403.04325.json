Despite extensive neurolinguistic research into the brain regions involved in meaning composition, a computational metric to quantify the extent of composition is still lacking. Drawing on the key-value memory interpretation of transformer feed-forward network blocks, we introduce the Composition Score, a novel model-based metric designed to quantify the degree of meaning composition during sentence comprehension. Experimental findings show that this metric correlates with brain clusters associated with word frequency, structural processing, and general sensitivity to words, suggesting the multifaceted nature of meaning composition during human sentence comprehension.",

    "translated_abstract": "含义合成的过程是指更小的单位如语素或单词组合形成短语和句子的含义，对于人类句子理解至关重要。尽管神经语言学对涉及含义合成的大脑区域进行了大量研究，但仍缺乏一种计算度量来量化合成的程度。借鉴变压器前馈网络块的键值内存解释，我们引入了组合分数，这是一种新颖的基于模型的度量标准，旨在量化句子理解过程中的含义合成程度。实验结果表明，这一度量与大脑簇相关联，这些大脑簇与词频率、结构处理和对单词的一般敏感性有关，这表明了人类句子理解过程中含义合成的多方面性。",
