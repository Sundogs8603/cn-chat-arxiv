    "translated_abstract": "联邦学习(FL)是一种分布式机器学习方法，通过在客户端本地训练模型并在参数服务器上进行聚合来保护用户数据隐私。尽管在保护隐私方面有效，但FL系统面临单点故障、缺乏激励和不足的安全性等局限性。为了应对这些挑战，将区块链技术整合到FL系统中，以提供更强的安全性、公平性和可扩展性。然而，区块链赋能的FL(BC-FL)系统对网络、计算和存储资源提出了额外的需求。本调查全面审查了最近关于BC-FL系统的研究，分析了与区块链整合相关的好处和挑战。我们探讨了区块链为何适用于FL，如何实施以及整合的挑战和现有解决方案。此外，我们还提供了关于未来研究方向的见解。",
