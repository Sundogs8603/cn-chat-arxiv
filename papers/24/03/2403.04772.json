The necessity to formalize the different content knowledge in approximate senses is recognized in the education research literature. A related problem is that of coherent formalizability.

In the present research, many issues in modeling teachers' understanding of content are identified, and a two-tier rough set-based model is proposed by the present author.

    "translated_abstract": "一名教师的知识基础包括数学内容知识、学生认识论知识和教学知识。这对于理解学生对内容的知识以及学习环境有着严重影响。教育研究文献认识到在近似意义上形式化不同内容知识的必要性。相关问题之一是协调的形式化问题。现有AI软件系统不关注意义，经过训练的系统也存在自身的问题。本研究识别了建模教师对内容理解中的许多问题，并提出了一种基于两层粗糙集的模型。所提出方法的主要优势在于其能够一致处理模糊性、粒度和多模态性。利用扩展示例展示了这些特点，以等式推理为例。",
