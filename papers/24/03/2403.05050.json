Addressing this, we introduce the Dynamic Router Network (DyRoNet), a framework that innovates with low-rank dynamic routing for enhanced streaming perception. By integrating specialized pre-trained branch networks, fine-tuned for various environmental conditions, DyRoNet achieves a balance between latency and precision. Its core feature, the speed router module, intelligently directs input data to the best-suited branch network, optimizing performance. The extensive evaluations reveal that DyRoNet adapts effectively to multiple branch selection strategies, setting a new benchmark in performance across a range of scenarios. DyRoNet not only establishes a new benchmark for streaming perception but also provides valuable engineering insights for future work.
