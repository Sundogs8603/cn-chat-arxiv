    "translated_abstract": "Classic Delphi和Fuzzy Delphi方法用于测试诸如问卷调查之类的数据采集工具的内容有效性。Fuzzy Delphi从语言角度处理评委员们发表的观点，通过使用模糊数值减少观点的歧义性。我们提出了一种称为二元模糊语言Delphi方法的扩展，以处理评委员展示不同专业程度的场景，通过使用语言术语的模糊多粒度语义，并通过2元语言值得出中间和最终结果。我们提案的关键思想是通过评估问卷的各个部分来验证整个问卷的有效性，将每个项目的有效性定义为决策问题。通过专家的意见，我们测量一致性程度、一致性程度和每个项目的语言分数，以便检测那些对工具的质量产生积极或消极影响的项目。",
