    "translated_abstract": "软件开发领域随着AI助手的出现（如GitHub Copilot）而发生了范式转变。然而，现有解决方案并未充分利用IDE中可用的所有潜在功能，如构建、测试、执行代码、git操作等。因此，它们受到其有限能力的限制，主要集中在在基于聊天的界面中建议代码片段和文件操作。为了填补这一缺口，我们提出了AutoDev，这是一个完全自动化的AI驱动软件开发框架，旨在实现复杂软件工程任务的自主规划和执行。AutoDev使用户能够定义复杂的软件工程目标，并将这些目标分配给AutoDev的自主AI代理以实现。这些AI代理可以在代码库上执行各种操作，包括文件编辑、检索、构建过程、执行、测试和git操作。",
