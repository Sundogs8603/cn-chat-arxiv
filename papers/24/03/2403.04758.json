    "translated_abstract": "近年来，大型语言模型的流行增长导致它们在总结、预测和生成文本方面的使用增加，因此帮助研究人员和工程师理解其工作方式及原因变得至关重要。我们提出了KnowledgeVis，这是一个人机协作的可视分析系统，用于使用填空句作为提示来解释语言模型。通过比较句子之间的预测结果，KnowledgeVis展示了在训练过程中语言模型学习到的联系，这直观地将语言模型学到的内容与自然语言下游任务联系起来，帮助用户创建和测试多个提示变体，使用新颖的语义聚类技术分析预测的单词，并使用互动可视化发现见解。总的来说，这些可视化帮助用户确定单个预测的可能性和独特性，比较不同提示之间的一组预测，并总结模式和联系。",
