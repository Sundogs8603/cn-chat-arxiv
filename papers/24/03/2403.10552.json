    "translated_abstract": "当一个机器人在一个一般的开放世界中运行时，目前自定位模型的一个典型假设是目标工作空间中有一个带标注的训练数据集。然而，在一般开放世界中，这种情况并不总是成立。本研究引入了一种新颖的开放世界分布式机器人系统训练方案。在我们的方案中，一个机器人（\"学生\"）可以向它在陌生地点遇到的其他机器人（\"老师\"）寻求指导。具体来说，从老师模型重建一个伪训练数据集，然后用于学生模型的持续学习。与典型的知识传输方案不同，我们的方案在老师模型上只引入了最小的假设，使其可以处理各种类型的开放式老师，包括不合作的、无法训练的（如图像检索引擎）和黑匣子老师（即数据隐私）。与现有方法中依赖于老师的私人数据可用性不同",
