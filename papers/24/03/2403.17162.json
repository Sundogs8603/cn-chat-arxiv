Our analytical framework includes: (1) evaluating the scale and concentration of capturable CO2 emissions at individual facilities for the purpose of estimating the cost of CO2 capture retrofits, (2) a screening method to identify potential CO2 storage sites and estimate their storage capacities, injectivities, and costs; and (3) an approach for cost-minimized design of pipeline infrastructure connecting CO2 capture plants with storage sites that considers land use patterns, existing rights-of-way, demographics, and a variety of social and environmental justice factors. In applying our framework to Louisiana, we estimate up to 50 million tCO2/y of industrial emissions (out of today's total emissions of 130 MtCO2/y) can be captured at under 100 USD/tCO2, and up to ",
