    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.08145v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: This paper studies a joint design problem where a seller can design both the signal structures for the agents to learn their values, and the allocation and payment rules for selling the item. In his seminal work, Myerson (1981) shows how to design the optimal auction with exogenous signals. We show that the problem becomes NP-hard when the seller also has the ability to design the signal structures. Our main result is a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for computing the optimal joint design with at most an $\\epsilon$ multiplicative loss in expected revenue. Moreover, we show that in our joint design problem, the seller can significantly reduce the information rent of the agents by providing partial information, which ensures a revenue that is at least $1 - \\frac{1}{e}$ of the optimal welfare for all valuation distributions.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文研究了一个联合设计问题，其中卖方可以设计代理人学习其价值的信号结构，以及用于出售物品的分配和支付规则。在他的开创性工作中，Myerson（1981）展示了如何设计具有外生信号的最优拍卖。我们表明，当卖方还具有设计信号结构的能力时，该问题变得NP难解。我们的主要结果是一个多项式时间逼近方案（PTAS），可在预期收入中最多失去$\\epsilon$的乘法性能的前提下计算最优联合设计。此外，我们表明在我们的联合设计问题中，卖方可以通过提供部分信息显著降低代理人的信息租金，这可以确保对于所有估值分布，其收入至少等于最优福利的$1 - \\frac{1}{e}$。",
