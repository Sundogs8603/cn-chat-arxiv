Previous studies on insider threat detection (ITD) mainly focus on detecting abnormal users or abnormal time periods (e.g., a week or a day). However, a user may have hundreds of thousands of activities in the log, and even within a day there may exist thousands of activities for a user, requiring a high investigation budget to verify abnormal users or activities given the detection results.

    "translated_abstract": "企业和组织面临来自内部员工可能导致严重后果的潜在威胁。先前关于内部威胁检测（ITD）的研究主要集中在检测异常用户或异常时间段（例如，一周或一天）。然而，用户可能在日志中有数十万条活动，即使在一天内，一个用户也可能存在数千条活动，这需要高昂的调查预算来验证异常用户或活动。另一方面，现有作品主要是事后方法而不是实时检测，无法及时报告内部威胁在引起损失之前。在本文中，我们进行了针对活动级别实时ITD的第一项研究，并提出了一个细粒度和高效的框架LAN。具体而言，LAN同时学习活动序列内的时间依赖关系和活动之间的关系。",
    "tldr": "该论文的贡献是提出了一个名为LAN的框架，能够实时在活动级别进行内部威胁检测，并学习活动序列内的时间依赖关系和活动之间的关系。",
    "en_tdlr": "The paper introduces a framework named LAN, which enables real-time insider threat detection at the activity level by learning the temporal dependencies within an activity sequence and the relationships between activities."
