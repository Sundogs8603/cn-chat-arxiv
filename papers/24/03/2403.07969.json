    "translated_abstract": "在本文中，我们提出了KnowCoder，这是一个大型语言模型（LLM），用于通过代码生成进行普适信息提取（UIE）。KnowCoder旨在开发一种统一的模式表示，使LLMs能够轻松理解，并且提出了一种有效的学习框架，鼓励LLMs遵循模式并准确提取结构化知识。为了实现这一目标，KnowCoder引入了一种代码风格的模式表示方法，将不同的模式统一转换为Python类，从而可以以LLM友好的方式捕捉UIE中任务之间的约束等复杂模式信息。我们进一步构建了一个包含超过30,000种知识类型的代码风格模式库，据我们所知，这是UIE中最大的库。为了简化LLMs的学习过程，KnowCoder包含一个通过代码预训练增强其模式理解能力的两阶段学习框架。",
