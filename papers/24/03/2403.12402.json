A typical speech LM takes discrete semantic units as content and a short utterance as prompt, and synthesizes speech which preserves the content's semantics but mimics the prompt's style. However, there is no systematic understanding on how the synthesized audio is controlled by the prompt and content. In this work, we conduct an empirical study of the widely used autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) speech LMs and provide insights into the prompt design and content semantic units. Our analysis reveals that heterogeneous and nonstationary prompts hurt the audio quality in contrast to the previous finding that longer prompts always lead to better synthesis. Moreover, we find that the speaker style of the synthesized audio is also affected by the content in addition to the prompt. We further show that semantic units carry r",

    "translated_abstract": "语音语言模型(LMs)通过上下文学习对高质量语音合成具有潜在价值。典型的语音LM将离散语义单元作为内容，短语言作为提示，并合成保留内容语义但模仿提示风格的语音。然而，对于合成音频如何受提示和内容控制并无系统性理解。在本研究中，我们对广泛使用的自回归(AR)和非自回归(NAR)语音LM进行实证研究，并深入探讨提示设计和内容语义单元。我们的分析表明，异质和非平稳提示会降低音频质量，与之前的研究相反，较长提示并不总是导致更好的合成。此外，我们发现合成音频的说话风格受内容影响，而不仅仅受提示影响。我们进一步展示语义单元携带的信息有助于生成高质量的音频。",
