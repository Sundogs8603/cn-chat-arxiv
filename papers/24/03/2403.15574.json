Yet, the significant influence of sensory experiences on emotional responses is undeniable. The natural language processing (NLP) community has often missed the opportunity to merge sensory knowledge with emotion classification. To address this gap, we propose SensoryT5, a neuro-cognitive approach that integrates sensory information into the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model, designed specifically for fine-grained emotion classification. This methodology incorporates sensory cues into the T5's attention mechanism, enabling a harmonious balance between contextual understanding and sensory awareness.

    "translated_abstract": "传统研究方法中，感知和情绪分类被认为是独立的领域。然而，感觉经历对情绪反应的显著影响是不可否认的。自然语言处理（NLP）社区经常错过将感觉知识与情绪分类相结合的机会。为了填补这一空白，我们提出了SensoryT5，这是一种神经认知方法，将感官信息整合到专为细粒度情绪分类而设计的T5（文本到文本转换Transformer）模型中。该方法将感觉线索融入T5的注意机制，实现了上下文理解与感觉意识之间的和谐平衡。结果模型增强了情绪表示的丰富性。通过对各种详细情绪分类数据集的严格测试，SensoryT5展示出了改善的性能。",
