However, in the unique domain of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the performance enhancement of LLMs is challenged by the essential differences between its theories and modern medicine, as well as the lack of specialized corpus resources. In this paper, we aim to construct and organize a professional corpus in the field of TCM, to endow the large model with professional knowledge that is characteristic of TCM theory, and to successfully develop the Qibo model based on LLaMA, which is the first LLM in the field of TCM to undergo a complete training process from pre-training to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

    "translated_abstract": "在人工智能领域，大型语言模型(LLMs)展示了在用户意图理解和响应方面取得的显著进展，在许多专业领域，包括医学、法律和金融。然而，在中医领域，LLMs的性能提升受到挑战，其原因在于中医理论与现代医学之间的根本差异，以及缺乏专业语料库资源。本文旨在构建和整理中医领域的专业语料库，赋予大型模型具有中医理论特色的专业知识，并成功基于LLaMA开发了Qibo模型，这是中医领域第一个经过完整训练过程（从预训练到监督微调）的LLM。此外，我们开发了Qibo基准测试，这是一个用于评估LLMs性能的专门工具。",
