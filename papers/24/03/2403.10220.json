    "translated_abstract": "随着天文设施的发展，这些设施观测到的大规模时间序列数据被收集起来。分析这些天文观测中的异常对于揭示潜在的天体事件和物理现象至关重要，从而推动科学研究过程。然而，现有的时间序列异常检测方法在处理天文观测的独特特征方面存在不足，其中每颗星体本质上是独立的，但受到随机并发噪声的干扰，导致假警报率较高。为了克服这些挑战，我们提出了AERO，这是一个专为天文观测中的无监督异常检测量身定制的新颖两阶段框架。在第一阶段，我们采用基于Transformer的编码器-解码器架构来学习每个变量（即星体）上的正常时间模式，以与变量独立性的特征保持一致。在第二阶段，我们e",
