Such data often manifest shift/imbalance in covariates (i.e., secondary non-imaging data). Controlling for such nuisance variables is common within standard statistical analysis, but the ideas do not directly apply to overparameterized models. Consequently, recent work has shown how strategies from invariant representation learning provides a meaningful starting point, but the current repertoire of methods is limited to accounting for shifts/imbalances in just a couple of covariates at a time. In this paper, we show how viewing this problem from the perspective of Category theory provides a simple and effective solution that completely avoids elaborate multi-stage training pipelines that would otherwise be needed.

    "translated_abstract": "许多学科中常见小样本大小，这需要跨多个机构汇总大致相似的数据集来研究图像与疾病结果之间的弱但相关关联。这些数据通常体现出协变量（即次要的非成像数据）的转移/不平衡。在标准统计分析中控制这些无用变量是常见的，但这些思想并不直接适用于参数过多的模型。因此，最近的工作表明，从不变表示学习中提供了一个有意义的起点，但目前的方法库仅限于一次考虑几个协变量的转移/不平衡。本文展示了如何从范畴论的角度看待这一问题，提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，完全避免了原本需要复杂的多阶段训练流程。我们展示了该方法的效果。",
