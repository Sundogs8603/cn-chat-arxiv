    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.13148v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is a widely used medical imaging modality for breast cancer screening and diagnosis, offering higher spatial resolution and greater detail through its 3D-like breast volume imaging capability. However, the increased data volume also introduces pronounced data imbalance challenges, where only a small fraction of the volume contains suspicious tissue. This further exacerbates the data imbalance due to the case-level distribution in real-world data and leads to learning a trivial classification model that only predicts the majority class. To address this, we propose a novel method using view-level contrastive Self-supervised Initialization and Fine-Tuning for identifying abnormal DBT images, namely SIFT-DBT. We further introduce a patch-level multi-instance learning method to preserve spatial resolution. The proposed method achieves 92.69% volume-wise AUC on an evaluation of 970 unique studies.",

    "translated_abstract": "数字乳腺断层摄影（DBT）是一种广泛应用于乳腺癌筛查和诊断的医学成像模式，通过其3D样的乳腺成像能力提供更高的空间分辨率和更多的细节。然而，增加的数据量也引入了明显的数据不平衡挑战，其中只有一小部分体积包含可疑组织。这进一步加剧了由于真实世界数据中的案例级分布而导致的数据不平衡，并导致学习一个仅预测多数类的琐碎分类模型。为了解决这个问题，我们提出了一种新颖的方法，使用视图级对比的自监督初始化和微调来识别异常的DBT图像，即SIFT-DBT。我们进一步引入了一种基于补丁级的多实例学习方法来保留空间分辨率。所提出的方法在评估970个唯一研究时实现了92.69%的体积级AUC。",
