    "translated_abstract": "准确估计锂离子电池的剩余寿命对于维持可充电电池管理系统的安全稳定运行至关重要。然而，由于涉及复杂的时间动态，这项任务通常具有挑战性。最近，基于注意力的网络，如变压器和Informer，在时间序列预测中已经成为流行的架构。尽管它们有效，但这些具有丰富参数的模型必须耗费大量训练时间才能揭示时间模式。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一个简单的基于MLP-Mixer的架构，名为“Intra-Inter Patch Mixer”（IIP-Mixer），它是一种仅基于多层感知器（MLPs）的架构，通过沿着内部补丁和跨补丁维度进行混合操作来提取有关电池剩余寿命预测的信息。所提出的IIP-Mixer包括并行的双头混合器层：内部补丁混合ML",
