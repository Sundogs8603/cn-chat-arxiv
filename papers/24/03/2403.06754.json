This integration enables more precise and consistent guidance of language models towards desired outcomes, particularly in complex and open text generation tasks.

    "translated_abstract": "我们介绍了ALaRM，第一个在强化学习中从人类反馈模型分层奖励的框架，旨在增强大型语言模型（LLMs）与人类偏好的对齐性。该框架解决了当前对齐方法的限制，这些方法通常难以处理人类监督信号的不一致性和稀疏性，通过将整体奖励与特定方面的奖励相结合。这种整合使得语言模型更加精确和一致地指导朝着期望的结果前进，尤其在复杂和开放的文本生成任务中。通过应用基于一致性的方法来过滤和组合多个奖励，该框架提供了一种可靠的机制来改善模型的对齐性。我们通过在长篇问题回答和机器翻译任务中使用gpt-3.5-turbo进行成对比较来验证我们的方法。",
