    "translated_abstract": "最优功率流（OPF）涉及一系列相关的优化问题，其目标是高效且安全地运行电力系统。在最简单的设置中，OPF确定需要发电多少电力，以在满足电力需求的同时最小化成本，并满足物理和运行约束。即使在最简单的情况下，由于解决精确问题的速度与现代求解器过慢，电力网格运营商使用AC-OPF问题的近似解。这些近似解为了速度而牺牲了准确性和运行可行性。这种权衡导致了昂贵的“增值付款”和碳排放的增加，尤其是对于大型电力网格来说。在本研究中，我们训练了一个深度学习系统（CANOS），以预测接近最优解（真实AC-OPF成本的1%内）而不牺牲速度（运行时间仅为33-65毫秒）。重要的是，CANOS可扩展到逼真的网格规模",
