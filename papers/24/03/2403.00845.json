We focus on two models of the advertisers' strategic behaviors. First, we assume that the advertiser is completely myopic; i.e.~in each round, they aim to maximize their utility only for the current round. In this setting, we develop an online mechanism based on upper-confidence bounds that achieves a tight $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret in the worst-case and negative regret when the values are static across all the auctions and there is a gap between the highest expected value (i.e.~value multiplied by their CTR) and second highest expected value ad. Next, we assume that the advertiser is non-myopic and cares about their long term utility. This setting is much more complex since an advertiser is incen",

    "translated_abstract": "在这项工作中，我们研究了广告拍卖中收入最大化的在线学习问题，其中卖方需要学习每个广告候选的点击率(CTR)，并通过按点击付费的方式收取获胜者的价格。我们关注广告主的两种战略行为模型。首先，我们假设广告主完全近视；即在每一轮中，他们只针对当前轮次最大化他们的效用。在这种情况下，我们基于置信上界开发了一个在线机制，在最坏情况下实现了严格的$O(\\sqrt{T})$遗憾，当值在所有拍卖中静态并且最高期望值(即值乘以他们的CTR)与次高期望值广告之间存在差距时，存在负遗憾。接下来，我们假设广告主是非近视的，并关心他们的长期效用。这种设置要复杂得多，因为广告主有动机",
