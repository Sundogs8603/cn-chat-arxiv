    "translated_abstract": "差分隐私(DP)具有多种理想属性，如对后处理的鲁棒性、组隐私和通过子抽样放大，这些属性可以相互独立推导。我们的目标是确定是否通过联合考虑这些属性中的多个可以获得更强的隐私保证。为此，我们专注于组隐私和通过子抽样放大的组合。为了提供适合机器学习算法的保证，我们在Rényi-DP框架中进行了分析，这比$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP具有更有利的组合属性。作为这个分析的一部分，我们开发了一个统一的框架，用于为Rényi-DP推导通过子抽样的放大保证，这是首个针对隐私核算方法的框架，也具有独立的重要性。我们发现，它不仅让我们改进和泛化现有的放大结果。",
