    "translated_abstract": "BasedAI是一个由分布式机器构成的网络，引入了去中心化基础设施，能够将全同态加密（FHE）与连接到其网络的任何大型语言模型（LLM）相结合。所提出的框架将一种名为“Cerberus Squeezing”的默认机制嵌入到挖矿过程中，实现了将标准LLM转化为加密的零知识LLM，或“ZK-LLMs”，利用生成对抗网络的见解来实现数据隐私保护。这种新颖的量化机制赋予BasedAI矿工能力，能够处理并响应来自用户与LLMs的交互得到的提示，而无需解密查询或相应内容。引入Cerberus Squeezing显著改善了当前FHE兼容计算环境中由量化函数引起的性能下降问题，通过积极优化用户、矿工和验证者之间的通信调用。",
