    "translated_abstract": "自我报告测量（例如，利克特量表）被广泛用于评估主观健康感知。最近，由于其能够精确且便于评估人们感受的能力，视觉模拟量表（VAS），一种滑动条量表，变得流行起来。这些数据可能会受到响应风格（RS）的影响，RS是一种用户依赖的系统性倾向，无论问卷说明如何都会发生。尽管在个体间分析中尤为重要，但对VAS中RS（表示为响应剖面（RP））的处理并未受到足够关注，因为它主要用于个体内监测且不太受RP的影响。然而，VAS测量通常需要对同一问卷项目进行重复自我报告，这使得难以在利克特量表上应用传统方法。在这项研究中，我们开发了一种新颖的RP表征方法，适用于各种类型的重复测量的VAS数据。",
