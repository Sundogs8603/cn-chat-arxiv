To address this Binary Classification task, which was daunting due to the complexity of the Legal Texts involved, we propose a simple yet novel similarity and distance-based unsupervised approach to generate labels. Further, we explore the Multi-level fusion of Legal-Bert embeddings using ensemble features, including CNN, GRU, and LSTM. To address the lengthy nature of Legal explanation in the dataset, we introduce T5-based segment-wise summarization, which successfully retained crucial information, enhancing the model's performance. Our unsupervised system witnessed a 20-point increase in macro F1-score on the development set and a 10-point increase on the test set, which is promising given its uncomplicated architecture.",

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文总结了团队SCaLAR在SemEval-2024任务5上的工作：民事程序中的法律论证推理。为了解决这个二元分类任务，由于涉及到的法律文本的复杂性而令人望而却步，我们提出了一种简单而又新颖的基于相似度和距离的无监督方法来生成标签。此外，我们探索了使用集成特征（包括CNN、GRU和LSTM）的多级Legal-Bert嵌入的融合。为了解决数据集中法律解释的冗长性，我们引入了基于T5的分段摘要，成功地保留了关键信息，提升了模型的性能。我们的无监督系统在开发集上见证了macro F1分数增加了20个百分点，在测试集上增加了10个百分点，考虑到其简单的架构，这是令人鼓舞的。",
