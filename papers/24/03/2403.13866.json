    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.13866v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: This article proposes auction-inspired multi-player generative adversarial networks training, which mitigates the mode collapse problem of GANs. Mode collapse occurs when an over-fitted generator generates a limited range of samples, often concentrating on a small subset of the data distribution. Despite the restricted diversity of generated samples, the discriminator can still be deceived into distinguishing these samples as real samples from the actual distribution. In the absence of external standards, a model cannot recognize its failure during the training phase. We extend the two-player game of generative adversarial networks to the multi-player game. During the training, the values of each model are determined by the bids submitted by other players in an auction-like process.",

    "translated_abstract": "本文提出了一种拍卖启发的多人生成对抗网络训练方法，可以缓解GAN的模式坍塌问题。模式坍塌指的是当一个过拟合的生成器生成一种有限范围的样本时，通常集中在数据分布的一小部分上。尽管生成的样本多样性受限，鉴别器仍然可以被欺骗，将这些样本误认为来自实际分布的真实样本。在没有外部标准的情况下，模型无法在训练阶段识别其失败。我们将生成对抗网络的双方游戏扩展到多方游戏。在训练过程中，每个模型的价值由其他玩家在类似拍卖的过程中提交的出价决定。",
