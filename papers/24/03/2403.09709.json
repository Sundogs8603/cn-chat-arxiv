    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.09709v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: The problems of online hate speech and cyberbullying have significantly worsened since the increase in popularity of social media platforms such as YouTube and Twitter (X). Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques have proven to provide a great advantage in automatic filtering such toxic content. Women are disproportionately more likely to be victims of online abuse. However, there appears to be a lack of studies that tackle misogyny detection in under-resourced languages. In this short paper, we present a novel dataset of YouTube comments in mix-code Hinglish collected from YouTube videos which have been weak labelled as `Misogynistic' and `Non-misogynistic'. Pre-processing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques have been applied on the dataset to gain insights on its characteristics. The process has provided a better understanding of the dataset through sentiment scores, word clouds, etc.",

    "translated_abstract": "自在线仇恨言论和网络欺凌问题以社交媒体平台（如YouTube和Twitter）的普及日益加剧以来，女性更有可能成为在线虐待的受害者。然而，在针对欠资源语言中的女性仇恨检测方面缺乏研究。本文提出了一个YouTube评论的新颖数据集，其中包含从被弱标记为“女性憎恨”和“非女性憎恨”的YouTube视频中收集的混合代码Hinglish评论。对数据集应用了预处理和探索性数据分析（EDA）技术以获取其特征的见解。这一过程通过情感分数、词云等提供了对数据集的更好理解。",
