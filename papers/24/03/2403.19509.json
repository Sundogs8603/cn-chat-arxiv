The UCLA Phonetics Lab Archive is one of the earliest multilingual speech corpora, with long-form audio recordings and phonetic transcriptions for 314 languages (Ladefoged et al., 2009). Recently, 95 of these languages were time-aligned with word-level phonetic transcriptions (Li et al., 2021). Here we present VoxAngeles, a corpus of audited phonetic transcriptions and phone-level alignments of the UCLA Phonetics Lab Archive, which uses the 95-language CMU re-release as our starting point. VoxAngeles also includes word- and phone-level segmentations from the original UCLA corpus, as well as phonetic measurements of word and phone durations, vowel formants, and vowel f0. This corpus enhances the usability of the original data, particularly for quantitative phonetic typology, as demonstrated through a case study of vowel int",

    "translated_abstract": "研究语音技术和比较语言学依赖于获得多样化和可访问的语音数据。 UCLA语音实验室档案是最早的多语种语音语料库之一，其中包含314种语言的长篇音频记录和语音切分。最近，其中95种语言已经与单词级语音切分进行了时间对齐。本文介绍了VoxAngeles，这是一个经过审阅的UCLA语音实验室档案的语音切分和音素级对齐语料库，使用了95种语言的CMU重新发行作为我们的起始点。VoxAngeles还包括了原始UCLA语料库的单词级和音素级切分，以及单词和音素持续时间、元音共振峰和元音f0的语音测量。该语料库增强了原始数据的可用性，特别是对于定量语音类型学，通过一个元音整体分析案例研究进行了展示。",
