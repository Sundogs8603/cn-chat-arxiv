    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.06769v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We investigate non-collaborative dialogue agents that must engage in tailored strategic planning for diverse users to secure a favorable agreement. This poses challenges for existing dialogue agents due to two main reasons: their inability to integrate user-specific characteristics into their strategic planning and their training paradigm's failure to produce strategic planners that can generalize to diverse users. To address these challenges, we propose TRIP to enhance the capability in tailored strategic planning, incorporating a user-aware strategic planning module and a population-based training paradigm. Through experiments on benchmark non-collaborative dialogue tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TRIP in catering to diverse users.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了非合作对话代理商，他们必须进行定制的战略规划，以确保与多样化用户达成有利的协议。这对现有的对话代理商构成挑战，主要原因有两点：他们无法将用户特定特征整合到战略规划中，以及他们的训练范式未能产生可以泛化到多样化用户的战略规划者。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了TRIP以增强定制战略规划的能力，包括用户感知的战略规划模块和基于人口的训练范式。通过对基准非合作对话任务的实验，我们展示了TRIP在迎合多样化用户方面的有效性。",
