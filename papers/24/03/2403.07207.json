One popular method to tackle this problem is the \"sliding window\" kernel density estimator.

The weight sequence, however, is a key aspect of the estimator affecting the tracking performance significantly. In this work, we study the exact mean integrated squared error (MISE) of \"sliding window\" Gaussian Kernel Density Estimators for evolving Gaussian densities. We provide a principled guide for choosing the optimal weight sequence by theoretically characterizing the exact MISE, which can be formulated as constrained quadratic programming. We present empirical evidence with synthetic datasets to show that our weighting scheme indeed improves the tracking performance compared to heuristic approaches.",

    "translated_abstract": "动态密度估计在许多应用中是普遍存在的，包括计算机视觉和信号处理。解决这一问题的一种流行方法是“滑动窗口”核密度估计器。该方法存在多种不同的实现，这些实现使用启发式定义的加权序列用于观测数据。但是，权重序列是影响估计器跟踪性能的关键因素。在这项工作中，我们研究了针对不断演变的高斯密度的“滑动窗口”高斯核密度估计器的精确均方集成误差（MISE）。我们通过理论上表征准确MISE的方式提供了选择最优权重序列的原则指南，它可以被构建为受限二次规划。我们通过合成数据集提供实证证据，表明我们的加权方案确实提高了跟踪性能，与启发式方法相比有显著改进。",
