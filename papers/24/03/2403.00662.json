    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.00662v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: Explanations are pervasive in our lives. Mostly, they occur in dialogical form where an {\\em explainer} discusses a concept or phenomenon of interest with an {\\em explainee}. Leaving the explainee with a clear understanding is not straightforward due to the knowledge gap between the two participants. Previous research looked at the interaction of explanation moves, dialogue acts, and topics in successful dialogues with expert explainers. However, daily-life explanations often fail, raising the question of what makes a dialogue successful. In this work, we study explanation dialogues in terms of the interactions between the explainer and explainee and how they correlate with the quality of explanations in terms of a successful understanding on the explainee's side. In particular, we first construct a corpus of 399 dialogues from the Reddit forum {\\em Explain Like I am Five} and annotate it for interaction flows and explanation quality. We",

    "translated_abstract": "解释在我们的生活中无处不在。大多数情况下，解释以对话形式出现，解释者与被解释者讨论感兴趣的概念或现象。由于两位参与者之间的知识差距，让被解释者理解并不是一件简单的事情。先前的研究关注了专家解释者成功对话中的解释步骤、对话行为和主题的交互。然而，日常生活中的解释经常失败，这带来了一个问题，即什么会使对话成功。在这项工作中，我们研究解释对话，关注解释者和被解释者之间的互动以及它们如何与解释质量相关联，以确保被解释者成功理解。特别是，我们首先构建了一个来自Reddit论坛“像我五岁一样解释”中的399个对话语料库，并对其进行了交互流程和解释质量的注释。",
