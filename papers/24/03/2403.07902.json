    "translated_abstract": "arXiv:2403.07902v1 交叉类型：设计3D配体以适应靶结合位点是药物发现中的基本任务。现有的基于结构的药物设计方法将所有配体原子视为平等处理，忽略了配体中原子在药物设计中的不同作用，并且在探索大型类似药物分子空间时可能效率较低。受制药惯例启发，我们将配体分子分解为两个部分，即臂和支架，并提出了一种新的扩散模型，即DecompDiff，其具有对臂和支架进行分解的先验。为了促进分解生成并改进生成的分子的性质，我们在模型中结合了键扩散，并在采样阶段加入了额外的有效性指导。对CrossDocked2020上的广泛实验表明，我们的方法在生成高亲和力分子的同时保持适当的分子性质方面实现了最先进的性能。",
