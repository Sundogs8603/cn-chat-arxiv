Specifically, users receive a notification banner, referred to as a pay-or-tracking wall, that requires them to (i) pay money to avoid being tracked or (ii) consent to being tracked.

This paper conducts several empirical studies and finds that top EU publishers use pay-or-tracking walls.

    "translated_abstract": "一些知名新闻出版商，最近甚至包括 Meta，开始要求用户为隐私付费。具体地说，用户会收到一个称为付费或追踪墙的通知横幅，要求他们（i）支付费用以避免被跟踪或（ii）同意被跟踪。这些墙引发了人们对隐私可能成为一种奢侈品的担忧。然而，对于付费或追踪墙知之甚少，这阻碍了对它们是否适当的深入讨论。本文进行了几项实证研究，发现顶级欧盟出版商使用付费或追踪墙。他们的实施涉及各种方法，包括将付费选项与无广告访问或额外内容捆绑在一起。不被跟踪的价格超过了出版商从同意被跟踪的用户所获得的广告收入。值得注意的是，在实施付费或追踪墙后，出版商的流量并未下降，大多数用",
