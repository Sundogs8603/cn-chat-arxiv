Surprisingly, we observe that modern neural networks can achieve excellent accuracy in classifying which dataset an image is from: e.g., we report 84.7% accuracy on held-out validation data for the three-way classification problem consisting of the YFCC, CC, and DataComp datasets. Our further experiments show that such a dataset classifier could learn semantic features that are generalizable and transferable, which cannot be simply explained by memorization. We hope our discovery will inspire the community to rethink the issue involving dataset bias and model capabilities.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们在新时代重新审视Torralba和Efros十年前提出的“数据集分类”实验，在拥有大规模、多样化和希望更少偏见的数据集以及更强大的神经网络架构的新时代。令人惊讶的是，我们观察到现代神经网络能够在分类图像来自哪个数据集方面取得出色的准确性：例如，对于包含YFCC、CC和DataComp数据集的三分类问题的验证数据，我们报告84.7%的准确性。我们进一步的实验表明，这样的数据集分类器可以学习到可推广和可转移的语义特征，这不能简单地解释为记忆。我们希望我们的发现能激励社区重新思考涉及数据集偏见和模型能力的问题。",
