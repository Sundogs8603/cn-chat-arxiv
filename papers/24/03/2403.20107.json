However, the decentralized and open characteristics of current FedRecs present two dilemmas. First, the performance of FedRecs is compromised due to highly sparse on-device data for each client. Second, the system's robustness is undermined by the vulnerability to model poisoning attacks launched by malicious users. In this paper, we introduce a novel contrastive learning framework designed to fully leverage the client's sparse data through embedding augmentation, referred to as CL4FedRec. Unlike previous contrastive learning approaches in FedRecs that necessitate clients to share their private parameters, our CL4FedRec aligns with the basic FedRec learning protocol, ensuring compatibility with most existing FedRec implementations.

    "translated_abstract": "最近，联邦推荐系统（FedRecs）因其保护隐私的好处而引起了越来越多的关注。然而，当前FedRecs的去中心化和开放特性存在两个困境。首先，每个客户端的设备数据非常稀疏，导致FedRecs的性能受损。其次，系统容易受到恶意用户发动的模型毒化攻击的威胁，从而破坏了系统的稳固性。本文介绍了一种新颖的对比学习框架，旨在通过嵌入增强充分利用客户端的稀疏数据，被称为CL4FedRec。与先前在FedRecs中的对比学习方法需要客户端共享私有参数不同，我们的CL4FedRec与基本的FedRec学习协议一致，确保与大多数现有的FedRec实现兼容。然后，我们通过对具有CL4FedRec的FedRecs进行鲁棒性评估来评估其鲁棒性",
