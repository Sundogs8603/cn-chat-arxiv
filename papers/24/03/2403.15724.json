    "translated_abstract": "Optical Character Recognition（OCR）是一个旨在识别图像中存在的文本的既定任务。尽管存在许多现成的OCR模型，但它们通常是针对科学（例如，公式）或通用印刷英文文本进行训练的。从化学出版物中提取文本需要一种能够在这两个领域中进行操作的OCR模型。最近的工具Nougat表现出解析学术文档的强大能力，但无法解析PubMed文章中的表格，这构成了学术界一个重要部分，并且也是本次工作的重点。为了弥补这一差距，我们提出了包含合成和真实记录的Printed English and Chemical Equations（PEaCE）数据集，并评估了当这一资源进行训练时，基于transformer的OCR模型的有效性。鉴于真实记录包含合成记录中不存在的人工制品，我们提出了模仿这些特质的转换。",
