Existing works typically focus on learning safety constraints for collaboration, or how to divide and distribute the subtasks between the participating agents to carry out the main task. In contrast, we propose to learn a human constraints model that, in addition, considers the diverse behaviors of different human operators. We consider a type of collaboration in a shared-autonomy fashion, where both a human operator and an assistive robot act simultaneously in the same task space that affects each other's actions. The task of the assistive agent is to augment the skill of humans to perform a shared task by supporting humans as much as possible, both in terms of reducing the workload and minimizing the discomfort for the human operator.

    "translated_abstract": "与人类实时协作面临挑战，因为不同的人类行为模式是受到不同物理约束的影响。现有研究通常关注于学习协作的安全约束，或者如何在参与的代理之间分配和分发子任务来执行主要任务。相比之下，我们提出学习人类约束模型，该模型考虑不同人类操作者的多样化行为。我们考虑一种在共享自治方式下的协作类型，其中人类操作者和辅助机器人同时在同一任务空间内行动，彼此的行动会相互影响。辅助代理的任务是通过尽可能支持人类，既降低工作量也最小化人类操作者的不适感，来增强人类执行共享任务的能力。因此，我们提出了一个增强型助手代理",
