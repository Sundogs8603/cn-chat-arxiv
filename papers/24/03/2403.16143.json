    "translated_abstract": "基于Transformer的模型通过利用其捕捉复杂上下文特征的固有能力，彻底改变了图像超分辨率（SR）领域。目前在Transformer架构中使用的重叠矩形偏移窗口技术是超分辨率模型中常见的做法，可以改善图像放大的质量和鲁棒性。然而，它在边界处存在失真，并且具有有限的独特移位模式。为了克服这些弱点，我们提出了一种非重叠三角窗口技术，它与矩形窗口同步工作，以减轻边界级别的失真，并允许模型访问更多独特的移位模式。本文提出了一种将三角-矩形窗口本地注意力与基于通道的全局注意力技术相结合的复合融合注意力Transformer（CFAT），用于图像超分辨率。因此，CFAT实现了注意力机制",
