We show these challenges with log data from a live legal search system and two user studies. We provide an overview of aspects of legal IR, and the implications of these aspects for the expected challenges of common evaluation methods: test collections based on explicit and implicit feedback, user surveys, and A/B testing. Next, we illustrate the challenges of common evaluation methods using data from a live, commercial, legal search engine. We specifically focus on methods for monitoring the effectiveness of (continuous) changes to document ranking by a single IR system over time. We show how the combination of characteristics in legal IR systems and limited user data can lead to challenges that cause the common evaluation methods discussed to be sub-optimal.

    "translated_abstract": "这篇论文阐明了法律信息检索（IR）常见排名评估方法面临的一些挑战。我们通过现场法律搜索系统的日志数据和两项用户研究展示了这些挑战。我们概述了法律IR的各个方面，以及这些方面对于期望中常见评估方法的挑战的影响：基于显式和隐式反馈的测试集、用户调查和A/B测试。接下来，我们使用现场商业法律搜索引擎的数据来阐明常见评估方法的挑战。我们专注于通过单个IR系统随时间连续更改文档排名的有效性监视方法。我们展示了法律IR系统特性与有限用户数据结合可能导致挑战，从而使讨论的常见评估方法不够理想。在我们的未来工作中，我们将专注于较少见的评估",
