    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.19946v1 Announce Type: cross  Abstract: A method that enables an industrial robot to accomplish the peg-in-hole task for holes in concrete is proposed. The proposed method involves slightly detaching the peg from the wall, when moving between search positions, to avoid the negative influence of the concrete's high friction coefficient. It uses a deep neural network (DNN), trained via reinforcement learning, to effectively find holes with variable shape and surface finish (due to the brittle nature of concrete) without analytical modeling or control parameter tuning. The method uses displacement of the peg toward the wall surface, in addition to force and torque, as one of the inputs of the DNN. Since the displacement increases as the peg gets closer to the hole (due to the chamfered shape of holes in concrete), it is a useful parameter for inputting in the DNN. The proposed method was evaluated by training the DNN on a hole 500 times and attempting to find 12 unknown holes. ",

    "translated_abstract": "提出了一种使工业机器人能够完成混凝土孔中插销任务的方法。该方法包括在搜索位置间移动时轻微将插销与墙面分离，以避免混凝土高摩擦系数的负面影响。它使用经过强化学习训练的深度神经网络(DNN)有效地发现具有可变形状和表面处理的孔(由于混凝土脆性)，而无需解析建模或控制参数调整。该方法使用插销朝向墙面表面的位移，以及力和力矩作为DNN的输入之一。由于插销靠近孔时位移会增加(由于混凝土中孔的倒角形状)，因此这是一种用于输入DNN的有用参数。通过对DNN进行500次孔的训练并尝试发现12个未知孔来评估了该提出的方法。",
