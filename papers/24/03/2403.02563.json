    "translated_abstract": "在手语识别、生成和翻译人工智能领域的研究不断增加的背景下，人们呼吁对这些技术进行道德发展。尽管这些工作对帮助个别研究人员取得更好成果至关重要，但有人指出，这一领域仍然由听力非手语研究人员主导，却鲜有针对系统偏见的讨论或塑造研究问题和方法的修辞分析。因此，我们对手语人工智能领域的101篇最新论文进行系统回顾。我们的分析发现了当前手语人工智能研究中的重大偏见，包括过分关注解决被认为存在的沟通障碍、缺乏使用具有代表性的数据集、使用缺乏语言基础的注释以及基于有缺陷模型构建方法等。我们认为，这一领域缺乏聋人利益相关者的有意义参与，并且更多地受到驱动的是",
