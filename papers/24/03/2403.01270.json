In some cases, users have taken advantage of anonymity in order to use harmful language, which can negatively affect the user experience and pose serious social problems. Recognizing the limitations of manual moderation, automatic detection systems have been developed to tackle this problem. Nevertheless, several obstacles persist, including the absence of a universal definition for harmful language, inadequate datasets across languages, the need for detailed annotation guideline, and most importantly, a comprehensive framework.

    "translated_abstract": "在当今数字化世界中，社交媒体在促进沟通和内容共享方面发挥着重要作用。然而，用户生成内容的急剧增长导致了在维护尊重的在线环境方面面临挑战。在一些情况下，用户利用匿名性使用有害语言，这可能会对用户体验产生负面影响并引发严重的社会问题。鉴于手动审核的局限性，已经开发了自动检测系统来解决这一问题。然而，仍然存在一些障碍，包括缺乏有害语言的统一定义，跨语言不足的数据集，需要详细的注释指南，以及最重要的是一个全面的框架。本研究旨在首次引入一个适用于任何语言的详细框架来解决这些挑战。",
