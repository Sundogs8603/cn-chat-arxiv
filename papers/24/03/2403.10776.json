Despite their versatility across diverse sectors, concerns persist regarding discriminatory tendencies within these models, particularly favoring selected `majority' demographics across various sociodemographic dimensions. Despite widespread calls for diversification of media representations, marginalized racial and ethnic groups continue to face persistent distortion, stereotyping, and neglect within the AIaaS context. In this work, we provide a critical summary of the state of research in the context of social harms to lead the conversation to focus on their implications. We also present open-ended research questions, guided by our discussion, to help define future research pathways.",

    "translated_abstract": "随着Gemini和GPT等先进生成模型的广泛应用，这些模型被纳入AI作为服务（AIaaS）的社会技术系统中，跨越多个领域。尽管如此，对这些模型在各种社会人口维度上的歧视倾向仍存在关切，尤其是倾向于某些“多数群体”人口统计特征。尽管有关媒体呼吁多样化代表的广泛，但在AIaaS背景下，边缘化种族和民族群体仍然面临持续扭曲、刻板印象和忽视。本文对社会有害研究现状进行了关键总结，引领讨论重点放在它们的影响上。我们还提出了本讨论指引下的开放式研究问题，以帮助确定未来研究途径。",
