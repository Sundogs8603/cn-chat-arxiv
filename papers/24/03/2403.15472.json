    "translated_abstract": "ChatGPT作为一种支持性工具整合到教育中，特别是在编程课程中，通过提供调试、代码生成和解释方面的帮助，解决了编程教育的独特挑战。尽管已有研究验证了ChatGPT的有效性，但其在大学级别的编程教育中的应用以及学生互动和观点的详细理解仍有限。本文探讨了在为大一学生量身定制的Python编程课程中，在八周的时间内，ChatGPT对学习的影响。通过分析来自调查、开放性问题以及学生-ChatGPT对话数据的回应，我们旨在全面了解ChatGPT的实用性，并确定学生所感知的其优势和局限性。我们的研究揭示了学生对ChatGPT普遍持肯定态度，并提供了有关其在增强编程教育体验中的作用的见解。",
