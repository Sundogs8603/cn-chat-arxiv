PTSD can affect anyone, regardless of ethnicity, or culture. An estimated one in every eleven people will experience PTSD during their lifetime. The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the PTSD Check List for Civilians (PCL-C) interviews are gold standards in the diagnosis of PTSD. These questionnaires can be fooled by the subject's responses. This work proposes a deep learning-based approach that achieves state-of-the-art performances for PTSD detection using audio recordings during clinical interviews. Our approach is based on MFCC low-level features extracted from audio recordings of clinical interviews, followed by deep high-level learning using a Stochastic Transformer. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performances with an RMSE of 2.92 on the eDAIC dataset thanks to t",
