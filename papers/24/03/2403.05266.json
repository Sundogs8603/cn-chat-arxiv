    "translated_abstract": "大型语言模型（LLMs）在各种应用中取得了前所未有的性能，然而它们的评估仍然是一个关键问题。现有的幻觉基准要么是静态的，要么缺乏可调整的复杂性进行彻底分析。我们认为利用现有的关系数据库是构建基准的一种有希望的方法，因为它们通过功能依赖关系可以准确描述知识。我们提出了ERBench，可以自动将任何关系数据库转换为基于实体关系（ER）模型的基准。我们的关键想法是使用数据库模式、记录和功能依赖来构建问题，以便可以自动验证。此外，我们使用外键约束来连接关系和构建多跳问题，这些问题可以任意复杂，用于调试LLMs的中间答案。最后，ERBench支持持续评估，多模态qu",
