    "abstract": "arXiv:2403.19847v1 Announce Type: new  Abstract: We examine how monetary shocks spread throughout an economic model characterized by sticky prices and general equilibrium, where the pricing strategies of firms are interlinked, fostering a mutually beneficial relationship. In this dynamic equilibrium, pricing choices of firms are influenced by overall economic factors, which are themselves affected by these decisions. We approach this situation using a path integral control method, yielding several important insights. We confirm the presence and uniqueness of the equilibrium and scrutinize the impulse response function (IRF) of output subsequent to a shock affecting the entire economy.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了货币冲击在粘性价格和一般均衡经济模型中如何传播，其中公司的定价策略相互关联，促进了一种相互有利的关系。在这种动态均衡中，公司的定价选择受整体经济因素的影响，这些因素本身又受到这些决策的影响。我们采用路径积分控制方法来处理这种情况，得出了几个重要的见解。我们确认了均衡的存在和独特性，并审查了在影响整个经济的冲击之后产出的冲击响应函数（IRF）。",
