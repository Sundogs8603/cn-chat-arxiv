    "translated_abstract": "本文详细介绍了一种创新的方法，将图像数据整合到传统计量经济模型中。受到为住宅房地产销售价格做预测的动机，我们利用深度学习的力量将图像中包含的“信息”作为协变量添加进去。具体地，房屋的图像通过一组图像分类器（ResNet-50、VGG16、MobileNet和Inception V3）进行分类和编码。每幅图像中呈现的独特特征通过全景分割进一步进行编码。通过对编码数据进行训练的神经网络的预测，提高了样本外预测能力。我们还将这些基于图像的预测与标准的平凡地产物业和位置特征结合起来，形成了一个统一的数据集。我们展示了当编码特征被视为额外的协变量时，基于图像的预测提高了平凡的预测准确性。我们还尝试“解释”哪些协变量",
