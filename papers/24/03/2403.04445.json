    "translated_abstract": "自从William Labov关于语言社会阶层化的基础工作（Labov, 1964）以来，语言学已经做出了集中的努力，探索社会人口特征与语言产生和理解之间的联系。尽管存在强烈的证据表明语言中存在着社会人口特征，但它们并不经常在自然语言处理（NLP）中使用。年龄和性别在一定程度上有所体现，但Labov最初的目标——社会经济地位却明显缺失。然而，这是重要的。我们通过实证显示自然语言处理使较不发达的社会经济群体处于不利地位。我们使用社会阶级、种族和地理语言差异来对电影中的95,000个话语进行标注，评估了NLP系统在语言建模、自动语音识别和语法错误纠正三个任务上的表现。我们发现可以归因于社会经济因素的显著表现差距。",
