    "translated_abstract": "近期人工智能研究的首要目标是稳步朝着实现人工通用智能(AGI)迈进，这促使对大型语言模型(LLMs)在各种任务和领域中的评估。其中之一是医疗保健领域，LLMs可以通过协助各种任务大大有益于临床实践。然而，当面对无法充分应对的查询时，这些模型也容易产生“幻觉”或不正确的响应，引发了关注和怀疑，特别是在医疗保健社区内。因此，在这项工作中，我们调查LLMs是否理解医学编码的固有含义，这些编码被广泛应用于医疗保健实践。我们评估了各种现成的LLMs (例如GPT、LLaMA等)和专门为生物医学应用设计的LLMs，以评估它们对这些领域特定术语的认识和理解。我们的结果表明…",
