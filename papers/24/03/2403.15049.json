Existing methods for training VLN agents presuppose fixed datasets, leading to a significant limitation: the introduction of new environments necessitates retraining with previously encountered environments to preserve their knowledge. This makes it difficult to train VLN agents that operate in the ever-changing real world. To address this limitation, we present the Continual Vision-and-Language Navigation (CVLN) paradigm, designed to evaluate agents trained through a continual learning process. For the training and evaluation of CVLN agents, we re-arrange existing VLN datasets to propose two datasets: CVLN-I, focused on navigation via initial-instruction interpretation, and CVLN-D, aimed at navigation through dialogue with other agents.
