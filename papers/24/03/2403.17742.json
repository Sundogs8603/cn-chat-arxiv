Such artifacts are due to the undersampling of the dependent variable in the synthetic neighborhood around the image being explained, which may result in inadequate explanations due to the impossibility of fitting a linear regressor on the sampled data. We then highlight a connection with the Shapley theory, where similar arguments about undersampling and sample relevance were suggested in the past. We derive all the formulas and adjustment factors required for an unbiased stratified sampling estimator. Experiments show the efficacy of the proposed approach.",

    "translated_abstract": "我们研究了一种分层抽样方法，用于改进LIME图像，这是一种流行的针对计算机视觉任务的模型无关可解释AI方法，以减少典型蒙特卡洛抽样产生的人工产物。这些人工产物是由于在解释的图像周围的合成邻域中对依赖变量的欠采样造成的，这可能会导致由于无法在采样数据上拟合线性回归器而导致解释不足。然后，我们强调了与Shapley理论的联系，在过去曾提出关于欠采样和样本相关性的类似论点。我们推导出了一种无偏分层抽样估计器所需的所有公式和调整因子。实验表明所提出的方法的功效。",
