For instance, the word 'ice' is often used to mean methamphetamine in drug crimes. To analyze the nature of cybercrime and the behavior of criminals, quickly detecting such words and further understanding their meaning are critical. In the automated cybercrime coded word detection problem, it is difficult to collect a sufficient amount of training data for supervised learning and to directly apply language models that utilize context information to better understand natural language. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new two-step approach, in which a mean latent vector is constructed for each cybercrime through one of five different AutoEncoder models in the first step, and cybercrime coded words are detected based on multi-level latent",

    "translated_abstract": "在社交网络服务平台中，犯罪嫌疑人可能会使用网络犯罪编码词进行通信，通过在现有单词中添加犯罪含义或用类似单词替换来实现。例如，单词\"ice\"经常被用来指代毒品犯罪中的甲基苯丙胺。针对自动化犯罪代码词检测问题，收集足够量的监督学习训练数据和直接应用利用上下文信息更好理解自然语言的语言模型都是困难的。为了克服这些限制，我们提出了一种新的两步方法，第一步通过五种不同的AutoEncoder模型之一为每个网络犯罪构建平均潜在向量，第二步基于多层潜在向量检测网络犯罪编码词。",
